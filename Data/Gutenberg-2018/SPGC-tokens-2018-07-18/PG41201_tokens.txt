preface
in
diary
of
a
superfluous
man
says
one
russian
critic
we
have
to
deal
with
the
end
of
the
pathological
process
upon
the
body
of
russian
society
in
turgénieff
productions
which
followed
it
we
have
to
deal
with
a
crisis
in
russian
life
with
the
growth
of
a
new
order
of
things
apart
from
the
fundamental
profundity
of
its
tendency
the
is
extremely
noteworthy
for
its
artistic
workmanship
in
spite
of
a
certain
monotony
of
tone
in
its
exposition
it
produces
a
very
strong
impression
by
its
abundance
of
poetical
beauties
which
are
perfectly
suited
to
the
melancholy
mood
of
the
whole
story
in
creating
his
man
the
author
evidently
aimed
at
making
as
powerful
an
impression
as
possible
and
therefore
employed
the
most
brilliant
pigments
in
depicting
tchulkatúrin
he
attained
his
object
russian
society
started
back
in
horror
at
this
portrait
of
itself
which
was
somewhat
distorted
yet
a
good
likeness
and
in
its
strong
excitement
vigorously
repelled
all
community
with
the
sickly
figure
of
tchulkatúrin
this
horror
showed
that
the
time
was
ripe
in
russian
society
for
a
different
order
of
things
that
it
was
tired
of
inertness
and
was
seeking
a
wider
field
of
activity
in
which
it
might
freely
develop
its
real
forces
another
critic
comparing
the
diary
with
hamlet
of
shshtchígry
county
says
that
what
the
latter
expressed
with
a
convulsive
laugh
tchulkatúrin
gave
vent
to
in
sickly
complaining
shrieks
both
productions
being
a
bitter
confession
of
moral
impotence
of
mental
insolvency
there
is
one
passage
in
the
he
says
which
especially
if
one
comes
upon
it
after
perusing
all
that
precedes
it
it
is
impossible
to
read
without
a
strong
nervous
shock
if
not
without
tears
a
passage
which
always
has
the
same
identical
effect
and
it
contains
the
key
to
the
comprehension
of
turgénieff
relations
toward
nature
it
is
the
end
of
the
this
passage
is
noteworthy
the
predominant
characteristic
of
turgénieff
talent
is
here
revealed
in
a
particularly
brilliant
manner
a
profound
impregnation
with
nature
an
impregnation
which
reached
the
point
almost
of
fusion
with
it
the
breath
of
spring
blows
upon
the
reader
there
is
a
scent
of
the
upturned
soil
and
nowhere
else
possibly
save
in
that
chapter
of
tolstóy
which
describes
the
removal
of
the
double
windows
and
the
reader
is
suddenly
enveloped
in
the
keen
fresh
air
of
spring
is
there
anything
which
can
be
compared
with
this
passage
still
another
critic
says
the
ironical
analysis
of
the
moral
feebleness
of
the
russian
intellectual
class
which
constitutes
the
ruling
motive
of
of
shshtchígry
county
is
converted
into
sickly
complaint
in
diary
of
a
superfluous
man
one
of
the
most
original
and
of
turgénieff
stories
and
one
which
is
most
profoundly
imbued
with
feeling
turgénieff
story
portraits
said
the
most
famous
of
russian
critics
byelínsky
possesses
in
addition
to
the
cleverness
and
vividness
of
its
presentation
all
the
fascination
not
of
a
novel
but
rather
of
a
reminiscence
of
the
old
times
a
fitting
motto
for
it
would
be
of
days
gone
by
all
the
critics
admit
that
the
type
of
vasíly
lutchínoff
had
existed
and
one
says
i
attribute
special
importance
to
turgénieff
vasíly
lutchínoff
because
in
this
character
the
old
type
of
don
juan
of
lovelace
and
so
forth
assumed
our
own
russian
original
form
for
the
first
time
this
type
equally
rapacious
with
that
presented
by
the
hero
of
the
bully
which
was
written
about
the
same
time
is
supposed
to
have
prevailed
in
the
eighteenth
century
especially
in
the
epoch
of
katherine
ii
although
turgénieff
never
wrote
historical
novels
this
story
in
company
with
passages
from
others
of
his
works
is
regarded
as
coming
practically
under
the
head
of
historical
records
faithful
to
the
epochs
dealt
with
by
the
author
the
story
meetings
says
one
critic
belongs
entirely
in
the
category
of
for
art
sake
there
can
be
no
question
here
of
any
guiding
idea
to
speak
figuratively
it
is
a
fragrant
flower
whose
perfume
one
inhales
with
delight
but
which
presents
no
other
essential
qualities
its
whole
point
lies
in
its
workmanship
and
in
paraphrase
it
loses
its
entire
charm
this
story
writes
another
critic
may
serve
in
our
opinion
as
a
curious
monument
of
the
ineptness
of
narrations
in
the
first
person
turgénieff
who
is
such
a
complete
master
of
the
form
of
personal
narration
was
bound
to
exhibit
also
the
weak
side
of
it
in
its
entirety
this
has
strutted
forth
in
his
meetings
with
such
pride
independence
and
in
a
measure
with
so
much
coquetry
that
it
has
swallowed
up
its
there
are
several
brilliant
pages
in
the
story
but
its
fantastic
showy
matter
seems
to
be
directed
solely
to
the
end
of
illuminating
the
person
of
the
narrator
in
the
most
advantageous
manner
in
discussing
the
memoirs
of
a
sportsman
a
leading
critic
of
the
present
day
says
another
peculiarity
which
immediately
won
for
him
turgénieff
fame
and
sympathy
among
the
public
is
his
entirely
new
manner
of
depicting
figures
from
peasant
life
before
the
advent
of
turgénieff
the
populace
even
in
the
hands
of
púshkin
even
in
those
of
gógol
appeared
either
in
the
capacity
of
an
operatic
chorus
or
in
the
quality
of
peasants
of
the
ballet
or
as
an
accessory
comic
figure
turgénieff
was
the
first
to
look
into
the
soul
of
the
common
people
and
demonstrate
that
that
soul
was
exactly
like
the
soul
of
the
cultivated
man
only
with
its
own
peculiar
turn
to
conceptions
and
feelings
by
thus
bringing
the
peasant
close
to
us
by
exhibiting
him
in
this
form
as
a
being
one
with
us
in
blood
with
whom
therefore
one
can
sympathise
instead
of
regarding
him
merely
as
a
rare
spectacle
turgénieff
deservedly
earned
the
reputation
of
a
champion
of
emancipation
two
other
tales
are
closely
allied
to
memoirs
of
a
sportsman
although
they
do
not
form
a
part
of
that
collection
and
one
of
them
is
perhaps
the
most
eloquent
denunciation
of
serfdom
which
ever
proceeded
from
pen
it
is
the
only
one
of
his
productions
in
which
the
central
figure
of
the
is
delineated
with
vivid
and
unconcealed
hatred
but
in
this
case
also
the
chief
merit
of
the
story
does
not
lie
in
this
arraignment
in
which
are
probably
reflected
the
author
childish
reminiscences
but
in
its
warm
compassionate
sympathy
for
the
lot
of
the
poor
dumb
man
whose
whole
life
was
concentrated
in
love
for
a
creature
equally
by
fate
for
the
little
dog
he
had
reared
in
inn
also
serfdom
is
set
forth
in
an
extreme
and
hateful
light
but
here
again
the
chief
gist
of
the
idea
does
not
lie
in
that
direction
it
is
evident
that
here
turgénieff
has
touched
on
the
theme
to
which
dostoiévsky
was
so
fond
of
reverting
that
theme
is
the
accidental
sin
of
a
good
and
honest
man
the
crime
of
a
pure
mind
atoned
for
by
voluntary
renunciation
and
the
reconciling
power
of
repentance
humility
and
prayer
evil
remains
unpunished
in
turgénieff
story
and
yet
the
story
produces
a
shattering
moral
effect
thanks
to
the
humble
grandeur
of
akím
figure
and
its
combination
of
meekness
and
criminality
mean
as
naúm
is
in
his
triumph
repulsive
as
is
elizavéta
prókhorovna
with
her
cowardly
and
hypocritical
greed
the
story
leaves
on
the
reader
a
soothing
impression
footnotes

the

dodge
as

he
could

he
thought
at

yes
i

god

also
well
all
right
if
i
must

then
is
better
to
die
in

is
it
not

to
begin
one

perhaps
a

yes
but
in

case
eternity
also
is
of
no

i
am
falling
into
speculation
i
think
that
is
a
bad
sign
am
not
i
beginning
to
turn
coward
it
will
be
better
if
i
narrate
something
it
is
raw
and
windy
out
of
doors
i
am
forbidden
to
go
out
but
what
shall
i
narrate
a
man
does
not
talk
about
his
maladies
composing
a
novel
or
something
of
that
sort
is
not
in
my
line
reflections
about
exalted
themes
are
beyond
my
powers
descriptions
of
life
round
about
me
do
not
even
interest
me
and
to
do
nothing
is
tiresome
to
read
is
idleness
eh
i
will
narrate
to
myself
the
story
of
my
own
life
a
capital
idea
when
death
is
approaching
it
is
proper
and
can
offend
no
one
i
begin
i
was
born
thirty
years
ago
the
son
of
a
fairly
wealthy
landed
proprietor
my
father
was
a
passionate
gambler
my
mother
was
a
lady
with
character
a
very
virtuous
lady
only
i
have
never
known
a
woman
whose
virtue
afforded
less
satisfaction
she
succumbed
under
the
burden
of
her
merits
and
tortured
everybody
beginning
with
herself
during
the
whole
fifty
years
of
her
life
she
never
once
rested
never
folded
her
hands
she
was
eternally
bustling
and
fussing
about
like
an
ant
and
without
any
result
whatever
which
can
not
be
said
of
the
ant
an
implacable
worm
gnawed
her
day
and
night
only
once
did
i
behold
her
perfectly
quiet
namely
on
the
first
day
after
her
death
in
her
coffin
as
i
gazed
at
her
it
really
seemed
to
me
that
her
face
expressed
mild
surprise
the
lips
the
sunken
cheeks
and
the
eyes
seemed
to
breathe
forth
the
words
how
good
it
is
not
to
stir
yes
is
good
is
good
to
part
at
last
from
the
fatiguing
consciousness
of
life
from
the
importunate
and
uneasy
sense
of
existence
but
that
is
not
the
point
i
grew
up
badly
and
not
cheerfully
both
my
father
and
my
mother
loved
me
but
that
did
not
make
things
any
the
easier
for
me
my
father
had
no
power
whatever
in
his
own
house
and
no
importance
in
his
quality
of
a
man
given
over
to
a
shameful
and
ruinous
vice
he
admitted
his
fall
and
without
having
the
strength
to
renounce
his
favourite
passion
he
endeavoured
at
least
by
his
constantly
affectionate
and
discreet
mien
by
his
submissive
humility
to
win
the
indulgence
of
his
exemplary
wife
my
mamma
in
fact
bore
her
misfortune
with
that
magnificent
and
ostentatious
of
virtue
which
contains
so
much
of
pride
she
never
reproached
my
father
for
anything
she
silently
surrendered
to
him
her
last
penny
and
paid
his
debts
he
lauded
her
to
her
face
and
behind
her
back
but
was
not
fond
of
staying
at
home
and
petted
me
on
the
sly
as
though
he
were
himself
afraid
of
contaminating
me
by
his
presence
but
his
ruffled
features
exhaled
such
kindness
at
those
times
the
feverish
smirk
on
his
lips
was
replaced
by
such
a
touching
smile
his
brown
eyes
surrounded
by
fine
wrinkles
beamed
with
so
much
love
that
i
involuntarily
pressed
my
cheek
to
his
cheek
moist
and
warm
with
tears
i
wiped
away
those
tears
with
my
handkerchief
and
they
flowed
again
without
effort
like
the
water
in
an
overfilled
glass
i
set
to
crying
myself
and
he
soothed
me
patted
my
back
with
his
hand
kissed
me
all
over
my
face
with
his
quivering
lips
even
now
more
than
twenty
years
after
his
death
when
i
recall
my
poor
father
dumb
sobs
rise
in
my
throat
and
my
heart
beats
beats
as
hotly
and
bitterly
it
languishes
with
as
much
sorrowful
compassion
as
though
it
still
had
a
long
time
to
beat
and
as
though
there
were
anything
to
feel
compassion
about
my
mother
on
the
contrary
always
treated
me
in
one
way
affectionately
but
coldly
such
mothers
moral
and
just
are
frequently
to
be
met
with
in
children
books
she
loved
me
but
i
did
not
love
her
yes
i
shunned
my
virtuous
mother
and
passionately
loved
my
vicious
father
but
enough
for
i
have
made
a
beginning
and
there
is
no
cause
for
me
to
feel
anxious
about
the
end
whatever
it
may
be
my
malady
will
attend
to
that
march
the
weather
is
wonderful
it
is
warm
and
bright
the
sun
is
playing
gaily
on
the
slushy
snow
everything
is
glittering
smoking
dripping
the
sparrows
are
screaming
like
mad
creatures
around
the
dark
sweating
hedges
the
damp
air
irritates
my
chest
sweetly
but
frightfully
the
spring
the
spring
is
coming
i
am
sitting
by
the
window
and
looking
out
across
the
little
river
to
the
fields
o
nature
nature
i
love
thee
so
but
i
came
forth
from
thy
womb
unfitted
even
for
life
yonder
is
a
male
sparrow
hopping
about
with
outspread
wings
he
is
screaming
and
every
sound
of
his
voice
every
ruffled
feather
on
his
tiny
body
breathes
forth
health
and
strength
what
is
to
be
concluded
from
that
nothing
he
is
healthy
and
has
a
right
to
scream
and
ruffle
up
his
feathers
but
i
am
ill
and
must
die
that
is
all
it
is
not
worth
while
to
say
any
more
about
that
and
tearful
appeals
to
nature
are
comically
absurd
let
us
return
to
my
story
i
grew
up
as
i
have
already
said
badly
and
not
cheerfully
i
had
no
brothers
or
sisters
i
was
educated
at
home
and
indeed
what
would
my
mother
have
had
to
occupy
her
if
i
had
been
sent
off
to
or
to
a
government
institute
that
what
children
are
for
to
keep
their
parents
from
being
bored
we
lived
chiefly
in
the
country
and
sometimes
went
to
moscow
i
had
governors
and
teachers
as
is
the
custom
a
cadaverous
and
tearful
german
riechmann
has
remained
particularly
memorable
to
me
a
remarkably
melancholy
being
crippled
by
fate
who
was
fruitlessly
consumed
by
an
anguished
longing
for
his
native
land
my
vasíly
nicknamed
the
goose
would
sit
unshaved
in
his
everlasting
old
coat
of
blue
frieze
beside
the
stove
in
the
frightfully
stifling
atmosphere
of
the
close
anteroom
impregnated
through
and
through
with
the
sour
odour
of
old
kvas
would
sit
and
play
cards
with
the
coachman
potáp
who
had
just
got
a
new
sheepskin
coat
white
as
snow
and
invincible
tarred
boots

riechmann
would
be
singing

the
other
side
of

partition

after
my
father
death
we
definitively
removed
to
moscow
i
was
then
twelve
years
of
age
my
father
died
during
the
night
of
a
stroke
of
apoplexy
i
shall
never
forget
that
night
i
was
sleeping
soundly
as
all
children
are
in
the
habit
of
sleeping
but
i
remember
that
even
athwart
my
slumber
i
thought
i
heard
a
heavy
laboured
breathing
suddenly
i
felt
some
one
seize
me
by
the
shoulder
and
shake
me
i
open
my
eyes
in
front
of
me
stands
my
what
the
matter
come
along
come
along
alexyéi
mikhaílitch
is
dying
i
fly
out
of
the
bed
like
a
mad
creature
and
into
the
bedroom
i
look
my
father
is
lying
with
his
head
thrown
back
all
red
in
the
face
and
rattling
in
his
throat
most
painfully
the
servants
with
frightened
faces
throng
the
doors
in
the
anteroom
some
one
inquires
in
a
hoarse
voice
has
the
doctor
been
sent
for
in
the
courtyard
a
horse
is
being
led
out
of
the
stable
the
gate
is
creaking
a
tallow
candle
is
burning
in
the
room
on
the
floor
mamma
is
there
also
overwhelmed
but
without
losing
either
her
decorum
or
the
consciousness
of
her
own
dignity
i
flung
myself
on
my
father
breast
embraced
him
and
stammered
out
papa
papa
he
lay
motionless
and
puckered
up
his
eyes
in
a
strange
sort
of
way
i
looked
him
in
the
face
unbearable
horror
stopped
my
breath
i
squeaked
with
terror
like
a
bird
they
dragged
me
from
him
and
carried
me
away
only
the
night
before
as
though
with
a
foreboding
of
his
approaching
death
he
had
caressed
me
so
fervently
and
so
sadly
they
brought
a
dishevelled
and
sleepy
doctor
with
a
strong
smell
of
lovage
vodka
my
father
died
under
his
lancet
and
on
the
following
day
thoroughly
stupefied
with
grief
i
stood
with
a
candle
in
my
hand
in
front
of
the
table
on
which
lay
the
corpse
and
listened
unheeding
to
the
intoning
of
the
chanter
occasionally
broken
by
the
feeble
voice
of
the
priest
tears
kept
streaming
down
my
cheeks
over
my
lips
and
my
collar
and
my
cuffs
i
was
consumed
with
tears
i
stared
fixedly
at
the
motionless
face
of
my
father
as
though
i
were
expecting
him
to
do
something
and
my
mother
meanwhile
slowly
made
reverences
to
the
floor
slowly
raised
herself
and
as
she
crossed
herself
pressed
her
fingers
strongly
to
her
brow
her
shoulders
and
her
body
there
was
not
a
single
thought
in
my
head
i
had
grown
heavy
all
over
but
i
felt
that
something
dreadful
was
taking
place
with
me
it
was
then
that
death
looked
into
my
face
and
made
a
note
of
me
we
removed
our
residence
to
moscow
after
the
death
of
my
father
for
a
very
simple
reason
all
our
estate
was
sold
under
the
hammer
for
debt
positively
everything
with
the
exception
of
one
wretched
little
hamlet
the
very
one
in
which
i
am
now
finishing
my
magnificent
existence
i
confess
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
i
was
young
at
the
time
i
grieved
over
the
sale
of
our
nest
that
is
to
say
in
reality
i
grieved
over
our
park
only
with
that
park
are
bound
up
my
sole
bright
memories
there
on
one
tranquil
spring
evening
i
buried
my
best
friend
an
old
dog
with
a
bob
tail
and
crooked
paws
trixie
there
hiding
myself
in
the
tall
grass
i
used
to
eat
stolen
apples
red
sweet
nóvgorod
apples
there
in
conclusion
i
for
the
first
time
beheld
through
the
bushes
of
ripe
raspberries
klaudia
the
maid
who
despite
her
snub
nose
and
her
habit
of
laughing
in
her
kerchief
aroused
in
me
such
a
tender
passion
that
in
her
presence
i
hardly
breathed
felt
like
swooning
and
was
stricken
dumb
but
one
day
on
the
bright
sunday
when
her
turn
came
to
kiss
my
lordly
hand
i
all
but
flung
myself
down
and
kissed
her
patched
goatskin
shoes
great
heavens
can
it
be
twenty
years
since
all
that
happened
it
does
not
seem
so
very
long
since
i
used
to
ride
my
shaggy
chestnut
horse
along
the
old
wattled
hedge
of
our
park
and
rising
in
my
stirrups
pluck
the
leaves
of
the
poplars
while
a
man
is
living
he
is
not
conscious
of
his
own
life
like
a
sound
it
becomes
intelligible
to
him
a
little
while
afterward
oh
my
park
oh
my
overgrown
paths
along
the
little
pond
oh
unhappy
little
spot
beneath
the
decrepit
dam
where
i
used
to
catch
minnows
and
gudgeons
and
you
ye
lofty
with
long
pendulous
branches
from
behind
which
from
the
country
road
the
melancholy
song
of
the
peasant
used
to
be
wafted
unevenly
broken
by
the
jolts
of
the
rough
cart
i
send
you
my
last
farewells
as
i
part
with
life
i
stretch
out
my
hands
to
you
alone
i
should
like
once
more
to
inhale
the
bitter
freshness
of
the
wormwood
the
sweet
scent
of
the
reaped
buckwheat
in
the
fields
of
my
natal
spot
i
should
like
once
more
to
hear
from
afar
the
modest
jangling
of
the
cracked
bell
on
our
parish
church
once
more
to
lie
in
the
cool
shadow
beneath
the
on
the
slope
of
the
familiar
ravine
once
more
to
follow
with
my
eyes
the
moving
trace
of
the
wind
as
it
flew
like
a
dark
streak
over
the
golden
grass
of
our
meadow
ekh
to
what
end
is
all
this
but
i
can
not
go
on
until
march
it
is
cold
and
overcast
again
such
weather
is
far
more
suitable
it
is
in
accord
with
my
work
yesterday
quite
unseasonably
evoked
in
me
a
multitude
of
unnecessary
feelings
and
memories
that
will
not
be
repeated
emotional
effusions
are
like
when
you
take
your
first
suck
at
it
it
does
seem
bad
but
it
leaves
a
very
bad
taste
in
your
mouth
afterward
i
will
simply
and
quietly
narrate
the
story
of
my
life
so
then
we
went
to
live
in
moscow
but
it
just
occurs
to
me
is
it
really
worth
while
to
tell
the
story
of
my
life
no
decidedly
it
is
not
worth
while
my
life
is
in
no
way
different
from
the
lives
of
a
mass
of
other
people
the
parental
home
the
university
service
in
inferior
positions
retirement
a
small
circle
of
acquaintances
downright
poverty
modest
pleasures
humble
occupations
moderate
desires
tell
me
for
mercy
sake
who
does
not
know
all
that
and
i
in
particular
shall
not
tell
the
story
of
my
life
because
i
am
writing
for
my
own
pleasure
and
if
my
past
presents
even
to
me
nothing
very
cheerful
nor
even
very
sorrowful
that
means
that
there
really
can
be
nothing
in
it
worthy
of
attention
i
had
better
try
to
analyse
my
own
character
to
myself
what
sort
of
a
man
am
i
some
one
may
remark
to
me
that
no
one
asks
about
agreed
but
you
see
i
am
dying
god
is
my
witness
i
am
dying
and
really
before
death
the
desire
to
know
what
sort
of
a
fellow
i
have
been
is
pardonable
i
think
after
having
thoroughly
pondered
this
important
question
and
having
moreover
no
need
to
express
myself
bitterly
on
my
own
score
as
do
people
who
are
strongly
convinced
of
their
merits
i
must
confess
one
thing
i
have
been
an
utterly
superfluous
man
in
this
world
or
if
you
like
to
put
it
that
way
an
utterly
useless
bird
and
i
intend
to
prove
that
because
i
am
coughing
like
an
aged
sheep
and
my
nurse
teréntievna
will
give
me
no
peace
lie
down
dear
little
father
mine
she
says
and
drink
your
i
know
why
she
worries
me
she
wants
some
tea
herself
well
all
right
why
not
permit
the
poor
old
woman
to
extract
at
the
finish
all
possible
profit
from
her
master
the
time
for
that
has
not
yet
gone
by
march
winter
again
the
snow
is
falling
in
large
flakes
superfluous
superfluous
that
a
capital
word
i
have
devised
the
more
deeply
i
penetrate
into
myself
the
more
attentively
i
scrutinise
the
whole
of
my
own
past
life
the
more
convinced
do
i
become
of
the
strict
justice
of
that
expression
superfluous
precisely
that
that
word
is
not
appropriate
to
other
people
people
are
bad
good
clever
stupid
agreeable
and
disagreeable
but
superfluous
no
that
is
to
say
understand
me
the
universe
could
dispense
with
these
people
also
of
course
but
uselessness
is
not
their
chief
quality
is
not
their
distinguishing
characteristic
and
when
you
are
speaking
of
them
the
word
superfluous
is
not
the
first
one
that
comes
to
your
tongue
but
i
of
me
nothing
else
could
possibly
be
said
superfluous
that
is
all
nature
had
not
evidently
calculated
on
my
appearance
and
in
consequence
of
this
she
treated
me
like
an
unexpected
and
unbidden
guest
not
without
cause
did
one
wag
a
great
lover
of
swedish
whist
say
of
me
that
my
mother
had
discarded
i
speak
of
myself
now
calmly
without
any
gall
is
a
thing
of
the
past
during
the
whole
course
of
my
life
i
have
constantly
found
my
place
occupied
possibly
because
i
sought
my
place
in
the
wrong
direction
i
was
suspicious
bashful
irritable
like
all
invalids
moreover
probably
owing
to
superfluous
vanity
or
by
reason
of
the
deficient
organisation
of
my
person
between
my
feelings
and
my
thoughts
and
the
expression
of
those
feelings
and
thoughts
there
existed
some
senseless
incomprehensible
and
insuperable
barrier
and
when
i
made
up
my
mind
to
overcome
that
impediment
by
force
to
break
down
that
barrier
my
movements
the
expression
of
my
face
my
entire
being
assumed
the
aspect
of
anguished
tension
i
not
only
seemed
but
i
actually
became
unnatural
and
affected
i
was
conscious
of
it
myself
and
made
haste
to
retire
again
into
myself
then
a
frightful
tumult
arose
within
me
i
analysed
myself
to
the
last
shred
i
compared
myself
with
other
people
i
recalled
the
smallest
glances
the
smiles
the
words
of
the
people
before
whom
i
would
have
liked
to
expand
i
interpreted
everything
from
its
bad
side
and
laughed
maliciously
over
my
pretensions
to
be
like
the
rest
of
the
world
and
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
my
laughter
i
sadly
relaxed
utterly
fell
into
foolish
dejection
and
then
began
the
same
thing
all
over
again
in
a
word
i
ran
round
like
a
squirrel
in
a
wheel
whole
days
passed
in
this
torturing
fruitless
toil
come
now
tell
me
pray
to
whom
and
for
what
is
such
a
man
of
use
why
did
this
happen
with
me
what
was
the
cause
of
this
minute
fidgeting
over
myself
who
knows
who
can
say
i
remember
one
day
i
was
driving
out
of
moscow
in
the
diligence
the
road
was
good
but
the
postilion
had
hitched
an
extra
to
the
this
unhappy
fifth
wholly
unnecessary
horse
fastened
in
rough
fashion
to
the
of
a
thick
short
rope
which
ruthlessly
saws
its
haunches
rubs
its
tail
makes
it
run
in
the
most
unnatural
manner
and
imparts
to
its
whole
body
the
shape
of
a
comma
always
arouses
my
profound
compassion
i
remarked
to
the
postilion
that
apparently
the
fifth
horse
might
be
dispensed
with
on
that
occasion
he
remained
silent
awhile
shook
the
back
of
his
neck
lashed
the
horse
half
a
score
of
times
in
succession
with
his
whip
across
its
gaunt
back
and
under
its
belly
and
said
not
without
a
grin
well
you
see
it
has
stuck
itself
on
that
a
fact
what
the
devil
the
use
and
i
also
have
stuck
myself
on
but
the
station
is
not
far
off
i
think
superfluous
i
promised
to
prove
the
justice
of
my
opinion
and
i
will
fulfil
my
promise
i
do
not
consider
it
necessary
to
mention
a
thousand
details
daily
occurrences
and
incidents
which
moreover
in
the
eyes
of
every
thoughtful
man
might
serve
as
incontrovertible
proofs
in
my
favour
that
is
to
say
in
favour
of
my
view
it
is
better
for
me
to
begin
directly
with
one
decidedly
important
event
after
which
probably
no
doubt
will
remain
as
to
the
accuracy
of
the
word
superfluous
i
repeat
i
have
no
intention
of
entering
into
details
but
i
can
not
pass
over
in
silence
one
decidedly
curious
and
noteworthy
circumstance
namely
the
strange
manner
in
which
my
friends
treated
me
i
also
had
friends
every
time
i
chanced
to
meet
them
or
even
dropped
in
to
see
them
they
seemed
to
grow
uneasy
as
they
came
to
meet
me
they
either
smiled
in
a
not
entirely
natural
manner
looked
not
at
my
eyes
not
at
my
feet
as
some
people
do
but
chiefly
at
my
cheeks
hastily
ejaculated
ah
how
do
you
do
tchulkatúrin
fate
had
favoured
me
with
that
name
or
ah
so
here
tchulkatúrin
immediately
stepped
aside
went
apart
and
even
remained
for
some
time
thereafter
motionless
as
though
they
were
trying
to
recall
something
i
noticed
all
this
because
i
am
not
deficient
in
penetration
and
the
gift
of
observation
on
the
whole
i
am
not
stupid
decidedly
amusing
thoughts
sometimes
come
into
my
head
even
not
at
all
ordinary
thoughts
but
as
i
am
a
superfluous
man
with
a
dumbness
inside
me
i
dread
to
express
my
thought
the
more
so
as
i
know
beforehand
that
i
shall
express
it
very
badly
it
even
seems
strange
to
me
sometimes
that
people
can
talk
and
so
simply
so
freely
what
a
calamity
you
think
i
am
bound
to
say
that
my
tongue
pretty
often
itched
in
spite
of
my
dumbness
and
i
actually
did
utter
words
in
my
youth
but
in
riper
years
i
succeeded
in
restraining
myself
almost
every
time
i
would
say
to
myself
in
an
undertone
see
here
now
will
be
better
for
me
to
hold
my
tongue
awhile
and
i
quieted
down
we
are
all
experts
at
holding
our
tongues
our
women
in
particular
have
that
capacity
one
exalted
young
russian
lady
maintains
silence
so
vigorously
that
such
a
spectacle
is
capable
of
producing
a
slight
shiver
and
cold
perspiration
even
in
a
man
who
has
been
forewarned
but
that
is
not
the
point
and
it
is
not
for
me
to
criticise
other
people
i
will
proceed
to
the
promised
story
several
years
ago
thanks
to
a
concurrence
of
trivial
but
for
me
very
important
circumstances
i
chanced
to
pass
six
months
in
the
county
town
of
this
town
is
built
entirely
on
a
declivity
it
has
about
eight
hundred
inhabitants
remarkably
poor
the
wretched
little
houses
are
outrageously
bad
in
the
main
street
under
the
guise
of
a
pavement
formidable
slabs
of
unhewn
limestone
crop
out
whitely
here
and
there
in
consequence
of
which
even
the
drive
around
it
in
the
very
centre
of
an
astonishingly
untidy
square
rises
a
tiny
yellowish
structure
with
dark
holes
and
in
the
holes
sit
men
in
large
caps
with
visors
and
pretend
to
be
engaged
in
trade
there
also
rears
itself
aloft
a
remarkably
tall
striped
pole
and
beside
the
pole
by
way
of
order
at
the
command
of
the
authorities
a
load
of
yellow
hay
is
kept
and
one
governmental
hen
stalks
about
in
a
word
in
the
town
of
existence
is
excellent
during
the
early
days
of
my
sojourn
in
that
town
i
nearly
went
out
of
my
mind
with
ennui
i
must
say
of
myself
that
although
i
am
a
superfluous
man
of
course
yet
it
is
not
of
my
own
will
i
am
sickly
myself
but
i
can
not
endure
anything
sickly
i
would
have
no
objections
to
happiness
i
have
even
tried
to
approach
it
from
the
right
and
from
the
left
and
therefore
it
is
not
surprising
that
i
can
also
feel
bored
like
any
other
mortal
i
found
myself
in
the
town
of
on
business
connected
with
the
government
service
teréntievna
is
absolutely
determined
to
kill
me
here
is
a
specimen
of
our
conversation
dear
little
father
why
do
you
keep
writing
it
is
healthy
for
you
to
write
but
i
bored
teréntievna
but
do
drink
some
tea
and
lie
down
but
i
do
feel
sleepy
akh
dear
little
father
why
do
you
say
that
the
lord
be
with
you
lie
down
now
lie
down
it
better
for
you
i
shall
die
anyway
teréntievna
the
lord
forbid
and
have
mercy
well
now
do
you
order
me
to
make
tea
i
shall
not
survive
this
week
teréntievna
dear
little
father
why
do
you
say
that
so
i
go
and
prepare
the
samovár
oh
decrepit
yellow
toothless
creature
is
it
possible
that
to
you
i
am
not
a
man
march
a
hard
frost
on
the
very
day
of
my
arrival
in
the
town
of
the
governmental
business
caused
me
to
call
on
a
certain
ozhógin
kiríll
matvyéevitch
one
of
the
chief
officials
of
the
county
but
i
made
acquaintance
with
him
or
as
the
saying
is
got
intimate
with
him
two
weeks
later
his
house
was
situated
on
the
principal
street
and
was
distinguished
from
all
the
rest
by
its
size
its
painted
roof
and
two
lions
on
the
gate
belonging
to
that
race
of
lions
which
bear
a
remarkable
likeness
to
the
unsuccessful
dogs
whose
birthplace
is
moscow
it
is
possible
to
deduce
from
these
lions
alone
that
ozhógin
was
an
opulent
man
and
in
fact
he
owned
four
hundred
souls
of
serfs
he
received
at
his
house
the
best
society
of
the
town
of
and
bore
the
reputation
of
being
a
hospitable
man
the
chief
of
police
came
to
him
in
a
broad
drozhky
drawn
by
a
pair
of
horses
a
remarkably
large
man
who
seemed
to
have
been
carved
out
of
material
other
officials
visited
him
also
the
pettifogger
a
yellowish
and
rather
malicious
creature
the
waggish
surveyor
of
german
extraction
with
a
tatár
face
the
officer
of
ways
of
communication
a
tender
soul
a
singer
but
a
a
former
county
marshal
of
nobility
a
gentleman
with
dyed
hair
and
rumpled
cuffs
trousers
with
straps
and
that
extremely
noble
expression
of
countenance
which
is
so
characteristic
of
people
who
have
been
under
trial
by
the
courts
he
was
visited
also
by
two
landed
proprietors
inseparable
friends
both
no
longer
young
and
even
threadbare
with
age
the
younger
of
whom
was
constantly
squelching
the
elder
and
shutting
his
mouth
with
one
and
the
same
reproach
come
that
will
do
sergyéi
sergyéitch
what
do
you
know
about
it
for
you
write
the
word
cork
with
the
letter
yes
gentlemen
he
was
wont
to
continue
with
all
the
heat
of
conviction
addressing
those
present
sergyéi
sergyéitch
writes
not
but
and
all
present
laughed
although
probably
not
one
of
them
was
particularly
distinguished
for
his
skill
in
orthography
and
the
unhappy
sergyéi
sergyéitch
held
his
peace
and
bowed
his
head
with
a
pacific
smile
but
i
am
forgetting
that
my
days
are
numbered
and
am
entering
into
too
great
detail
so
then
without
further
circumlocution
ozhógin
was
married
and
had
a
daughter
elizavéta
kiríllovna
and
i
fell
in
love
with
that
daughter
ozhógin
himself
was
a
commonplace
man
neither
good
nor
bad
his
wife
was
beginning
to
look
a
good
deal
like
an
aged
hen
but
their
daughter
did
not
take
after
her
parents
she
was
very
comely
of
vivacious
and
gentle
disposition
her
bright
grey
eyes
gazed
and
in
a
straightforward
manner
from
beneath
brows
she
smiled
almost
constantly
and
laughed
also
quite
frequently
her
fresh
voice
had
a
very
pleasant
ring
she
moved
easily
swiftly
and
blushed
gaily
she
did
not
dress
very
elegantly
extremely
simple
gowns
suited
her
best
as
a
rule
i
have
never
made
acquaintance
quickly
and
if
i
have
felt
at
ease
with
a
person
on
first
meeting
which
however
has
almost
never
been
the
case
i
confess
that
that
has
spoken
strongly
in
favour
of
the
new
acquaintance
i
have
not
known
how
to
behave
to
women
at
all
and
in
their
presence
i
either
frowned
and
assumed
a
fierce
expression
or
displayed
my
teeth
in
a
grin
in
the
stupidest
way
and
twisted
my
tongue
about
in
my
mouth
with
embarrassment
with
elizavéta
kiríllovna
on
the
contrary
i
felt
myself
at
home
from
the
very
first
moment
this
is
how
it
came
about
one
day
i
arrive
at
ozhógin
before
dinner
and
ask
is
he
at
home
i
am
told
yes
and
he
is
dressing
please
come
into
the
hall
i
go
into
the
hall
i
see
a
young
girl
in
a
white
gown
standing
by
the
window
with
her
back
toward
me
and
holding
a
cage
in
her
hands
i
curl
up
a
little
according
to
my
habit
but
nevertheless
i
cough
out
of
propriety
the
young
girl
turns
round
quickly
so
quickly
that
her
curls
strike
her
in
the
face
catches
sight
of
me
bows
and
with
a
smile
shows
me
a
little
box
with
seed
will
you
excuse
me
of
course
as
is
customary
in
such
circumstances
i
first
bent
my
head
and
at
the
same
time
crooked
and
straightened
my
knees
as
though
some
one
had
hit
me
from
behind
in
the
back
of
my
legs
which
as
everybody
knows
serves
as
a
token
of
excellent
breeding
and
agreeable
ease
of
manner
and
then
smiled
raised
my
hand
and
waved
it
twice
cautiously
and
gently
in
the
air
the
girl
immediately
turned
away
from
me
took
from
the
cage
a
small
board
and
began
to
scrape
it
violently
with
a
knife
and
suddenly
without
changing
her
attitude
gave
utterance
to
the
following
words
this
is
papa
do
you
like
i
prefer
i
replied
not
without
a
certain
effort
and
i
am
fond
of
also
but
just
look
at
him
see
how
pretty
he
is
see
he
is
not
afraid
what
surprised
me
was
that
i
was
not
come
closer
his
name
is
pópka
i
went
up
and
bent
over
he
very
charming
is
he
she
turned
her
face
toward
me
but
we
were
standing
so
close
to
each
other
that
she
was
obliged
to
throw
her
head
back
a
little
in
order
to
look
at
me
with
her
bright
eyes
i
gazed
at
her
the
whole
of
her
rosy
young
face
was
smiling
in
so
friendly
a
manner
that
i
smiled
also
and
almost
laughed
aloud
with
pleasure
the
door
opened
ozhógin
entered
i
immediately
went
to
him
and
began
to
talk
with
him
in
a
very
unembarrassed
way
i
do
not
know
myself
how
i
came
to
stay
to
dinner
i
sat
out
the
whole
evening
and
on
the
following
day
ozhógin
lackey
a
long
purblind
fellow
was
already
smiling
at
me
as
a
friend
of
the
house
as
he
pulled
off
my
overcoat
to
find
a
refuge
to
weave
for
myself
even
a
temporary
nest
to
know
the
joy
of
daily
relations
and
habits
that
was
a
happiness
which
i
a
superfluous
man
without
domestic
memories
had
not
experienced
up
to
that
time
if
there
were
anything
about
me
suggestive
of
a
flower
and
if
that
comparison
were
not
so
threadbare
i
would
decide
to
say
that
from
that
hour
i
began
to
blossom
out
in
spirit
everything
in
me
and
round
about
me
underwent
such
an
instantaneous
change
my
whole
life
was
illuminated
by
love
literally
my
whole
life
down
to
the
smallest
details
like
a
dark
deserted
chamber
into
which
a
candle
has
been
brought
i
lay
down
to
sleep
and
i
rose
up
dressed
myself
breakfasted
and
smoked
my
pipe
in
a
way
different
from
my
habit
i
even
skipped
as
i
walked
really
i
did
as
though
wings
had
suddenly
sprouted
on
my
shoulders
i
remember
that
i
was
not
in
doubt
even
for
a
minute
as
to
the
feeling
with
which
elizavéta
kiríllovna
had
inspired
me
and
from
the
very
first
day
i
fell
in
love
with
her
passionately
and
from
the
very
first
day
too
i
knew
that
i
was
in
love
i
saw
her
every
day
for
the
space
of
three
weeks
those
three
weeks
were
the
happiest
time
of
my
life
but
the
remembrance
of
them
is
painful
to
me
i
can
not
think
of
them
alone
that
which
followed
them
involuntarily
rises
up
before
me
and
venomous
grief
slowly
grips
the
heart
which
had
just
grown
soft
when
a
man
is
feeling
very
well
his
brain
as
every
one
knows
acts
very
little
a
calm
and
joyous
feeling
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
permeates
his
whole
being
he
is
swallowed
up
in
it
the
consciousness
of
individuality
vanishes
in
him
he
is
in
a
state
of
bliss
as
badly
educated
poets
say
but
when
at
last
that
spell
passes
off
a
man
sometimes
feels
vexed
and
regretful
that
in
the
midst
of
happiness
he
was
so
unobservant
of
himself
that
he
did
not
redouble
his
thoughts
his
reflections
and
his
memories
that
he
did
not
prolong
his
enjoyment
as
though
a
blissful
man
had
any
time
and
as
though
it
were
worth
while
to
reflect
about
his
own
emotions
the
happy
man
is
like
a
fly
in
the
sunshine
that
is
why
when
i
recall
those
three
weeks
i
find
it
almost
impossible
to
retain
in
my
mind
an
accurate
definite
impression
the
more
so
as
in
the
whole
course
of
that
time
nothing
of
particular
note
took
place
between
us
those
twenty
days
present
themselves
to
me
as
something
warm
young
and
fragrant
as
a
sort
of
bright
streak
in
my
dim
and
life
my
memory
suddenly
becomes
implacably
faithful
and
clear
only
dating
from
the
moment
when
the
blows
of
fate
descended
upon
me
speaking
again
in
the
words
of
those
same
writers
yes
those
three
weeks
however
they
did
not
precisely
leave
no
images
behind
in
me
sometimes
when
i
happen
to
think
long
of
that
time
certain
memories
suddenly
float
forth
from
the
gloom
of
the
past
as
the
stars
unexpectedly
start
forth
in
the
evening
sky
to
meet
eyes
especially
memorable
to
me
is
one
stroll
in
a
grove
outside
the
town
there
were
four
of
us
old
madame
ozhógin
liza
i
and
a
certain
bizmyónkoff
a
petty
official
of
the
town
of
a
and
meek
young
man
i
shall
have
occasion
to
allude
to
him
again
ozhógin
remained
at
home
his
head
ached
in
consequence
of
his
having
slept
too
long
the
day
was
splendid
warm
and
calm
i
must
remark
that
gardens
of
entertainment
and
public
amusement
are
not
to
the
taste
of
the
russian
in
governmental
towns
in
the
public
gardens
you
will
never
encounter
a
living
soul
at
any
season
of
the
year
possibly
some
old
woman
will
seat
herself
grunting
on
a
green
bench
baked
through
and
through
by
the
sun
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
sickly
tree
and
that
only
when
there
is
no
dirty
little
shop
close
to
the
gate
but
if
there
is
a
sparse
little
in
the
vicinity
of
the
town
the
merchants
and
sometimes
the
officials
will
gladly
go
thither
on
sundays
and
with
their
samovár
patties
and
set
out
all
those
good
gifts
on
the
dusty
grass
right
by
the
side
of
the
road
seat
themselves
around
and
eat
and
drink
tea
in
the
sweat
of
their
brows
until
the
very
evening
precisely
that
sort
of
small
grove
existed
then
two
versts
distant
from
the
town
of
we
went
thither
after
dinner
drank
tea
in
due
form
and
then
all
four
of
us
set
off
for
a
stroll
through
the
grove
bizmyónkoff
gave
his
arm
to
old
madame
ozhógin
i
gave
mine
to
liza
the
day
was
already
inclining
toward
evening
i
was
then
in
the
very
ardour
of
first
love
not
more
than
a
fortnight
had
elapsed
since
we
had
become
acquainted
in
that
condition
of
passionate
and
attentive
adoration
when
your
whole
soul
innocently
and
involuntarily
follows
every
motion
of
the
beloved
being
when
you
can
not
satiate
yourself
with
its
presence
or
hear
enough
of
its
voice
when
you
smile
and
look
like
a
convalescent
child
and
any
man
of
a
little
experience
must
see
at
the
first
glance
a
hundred
paces
off
what
is
going
on
in
you
up
to
that
day
i
had
not
once
chanced
to
be
arm
in
arm
with
liza
i
walked
by
her
side
treading
softly
on
the
green
grass
a
light
breeze
seemed
to
be
fluttering
around
us
between
the
white
boles
of
the
now
and
then
blowing
the
ribbon
of
her
hat
in
my
face
with
an
importunate
gaze
i
watched
her
until
at
last
she
turned
gaily
to
me
and
we
smiled
at
each
other
the
birds
chirped
approvingly
overhead
the
blue
sky
peered
caressingly
through
the
fine
foliage
my
head
reeled
with
excess
of
pleasure
i
hasten
to
remark
that
liza
was
not
in
the
least
in
love
with
me
she
liked
me
in
general
she
was
not
shy
of
any
one
but
i
was
not
fated
to
disturb
her
childish
tranquillity
she
walked
arm
in
arm
with
me
as
with
a
brother
she
was
seventeen
years
old
at
the
time
and
yet
that
same
evening
in
my
presence
there
began
in
her
that
quiet
inward
fermentation
which
precedes
the
conversion
of
a
child
into
a
woman
i
was
witness
to
that
change
of
the
whole
being
that
innocent
perplexity
that
tremulous
pensiveness
i
was
the
first
to
note
that
sudden
softness
of
glance
that
ringing
uncertainty
of
voice
and
oh
stupid
fool
oh
superfluous
man
for
a
whole
week
i
was
not
ashamed
to
assume
that
i
i
was
the
cause
of
that
change
this
is
the
way
it
happened
we
strolled
for
quite
a
long
time
until
evening
and
chatted
very
little
i
held
my
peace
like
all
inexperienced
lovers
and
she
in
all
probability
had
nothing
to
say
to
me
but
she
seemed
to
be
meditating
about
something
and
shook
her
head
in
a
queer
sort
of
way
pensively
nibbling
at
a
leaf
which
she
had
plucked
sometimes
she
began
to
stride
forward
in
such
a
decided
way
and
then
suddenly
halted
waited
for
me
and
gazed
about
her
with
eyebrows
elevated
and
an
smile
on
the
preceding
evening
we
had
read
together
the
prisoner
of
the
caucasus
with
what
eagerness
had
she
listened
to
me
with
her
face
propped
on
both
hands
and
her
bosom
resting
against
the
table
i
tried
to
talk
about
our
reading
of
the
evening
before
she
blushed
asked
me
whether
i
had
given
the
any
before
we
started
began
to
sing
loudly
some
song
then
suddenly
ceased
the
grove
ended
on
one
side
in
a
rather
steep
and
lofty
cliff
below
flowed
a
small
meandering
river
and
beyond
it
further
than
the
eye
could
see
stretched
endless
meadows
now
swelling
slightly
like
waves
now
spreading
out
like
a
here
and
there
intersected
with
ravines
liza
and
i
were
the
first
to
emerge
on
the
edge
of
the
grove
bizmyónkoff
remained
behind
with
the
old
lady
we
came
out
halted
and
both
of
us
involuntarily
narrowed
our
eyes
directly
opposite
us
in
the
midst
of
the
mist
the
sun
was
setting
huge
and
crimson
half
the
sky
was
aglow
and
flaming
the
red
rays
beat
aslant
across
the
meadows
casting
a
scarlet
reflection
even
on
the
shady
side
of
the
ravine
and
lay
like
fiery
lead
upon
the
river
where
it
was
not
hidden
under
overhanging
bushes
and
seemed
to
be
reposing
in
the
lap
of
the
ravine
and
the
grove
we
stood
there
drenched
in
the
blazing
radiance
it
is
beyond
my
power
to
impart
all
the
passionate
solemnity
of
that
picture
they
say
that
the
colour
red
appeared
to
one
blind
man
like
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
i
do
not
know
to
what
degree
that
comparison
is
just
but
actually
there
was
something
challenging
in
that
flaming
gold
of
the
evening
air
in
the
crimson
glow
of
sky
and
earth
i
cried
out
with
rapture
and
immediately
turned
to
liza
she
was
gazing
straight
at
the
sun
i
remember
the
glare
of
the
sunset
was
reflected
in
her
eyes
in
tiny
flaming
spots
she
was
startled
profoundly
moved
she
made
no
answer
to
my
exclamation
did
not
stir
for
a
long
time
and
hung
her
head
i
stretched
out
my
hand
to
her
she
turned
away
from
me
and
suddenly
burst
into
tears
i
gazed
at
her
with
secret
almost
joyful
surprise
bizmyónkoff
voice
rang
out
a
couple
of
paces
from
us
liza
hastily
wiped
her
eyes
and
with
a
wavering
smile
looked
at
me
the
old
lady
emerged
from
the
grove
leaning
on
the
arm
of
her
escort
both
of
them
in
their
turn
admired
the
view
the
old
lady
asked
liza
some
question
and
i
remember
that
i
involuntarily
shivered
when
in
reply
her
daughter
broken
voice
like
cracked
glass
resounded
in
reply
in
the
meanwhile
the
sun
had
set
the
glow
was
beginning
to
die
out
we
retraced
our
steps
i
again
gave
liza
my
arm
it
was
still
light
in
the
grove
and
i
could
clearly
discern
her
features
she
was
embarrassed
and
did
not
raise
her
eyes
the
flush
which
had
spread
all
over
her
face
did
not
disappear
she
seemed
still
to
be
standing
in
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
her
arm
barely
touched
mine
for
a
long
time
i
could
not
start
a
conversation
so
violently
was
my
heart
beating
we
caught
glimpses
of
the
carriage
far
away
through
the
trees
the
coachman
was
driving
to
meet
us
at
a
over
the
friable
sand
of
the
road
lizavéta
kiríllovna
i
said
at
last
why
did
you
weep
i
do
know
she
answered
after
a
brief
pause
looking
at
me
with
her
gentle
eyes
still
wet
with
tears
their
glance
seemed
to
me
to
have
undergone
a
change
and
again
fell
silent
i
see
that
you
love
nature
i
went
that
was
not
in
the
least
what
i
had
meant
to
say
and
my
tongue
hardly
stammered
out
the
last
phrase
to
the
end
she
shook
her
head
i
could
not
utter
a
word
more
i
was
waiting
for
something
not
a
confession
no
indeed
i
was
waiting
for
a
confiding
glance
a
question
but
liza
stared
at
the
ground
and
held
her
peace
i
repeated
once
more
in
an
undertone
why
and
received
no
reply
she
was
embarrassed
almost
ashamed
i
saw
that
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
we
were
all
seated
in
the
carriage
and
driving
toward
the
town
the
horses
advanced
at
a
brisk
trot
we
dashed
swiftly
through
the
moist
darkening
air
i
suddenly
began
to
talk
incessantly
addressing
myself
now
to
bizmyónkoff
now
to
madame
ozhógin
i
did
not
look
at
liza
but
i
could
not
avoid
perceiving
that
from
the
corner
of
the
carriage
her
gaze
never
once
rested
on
me
at
home
she
recovered
with
a
start
but
would
not
read
with
me
and
soon
went
off
to
bed
the
break
that
break
of
which
i
have
spoken
had
been
effected
in
her
she
had
ceased
to
be
a
little
girl
she
was
already
beginning
to
expect
like
myself
something
or
other
she
did
not
have
to
wait
long
but
that
night
i
returned
to
my
lodgings
in
a
state
of
utter
enchantment
the
confused
something
which
was
not
exactly
a
foreboding
nor
yet
exactly
a
suspicion
that
had
arisen
within
me
vanished
i
ascribed
the
sudden
constraint
in
liza
behaviour
toward
me
to
maidenly
modesty
to
timidity
had
not
i
read
a
thousand
times
in
many
compositions
that
the
first
appearance
of
love
agitates
and
alarms
a
young
girl
i
felt
myself
very
happy
and
already
began
to
construct
various
plans
in
my
own
mind
if
any
one
had
then
whispered
in
my
ear
thou
liest
my
dear
fellow
that
not
in
store
for
thee
at
all
my
lad
thou
art
doomed
to
die
alone
in
a
miserable
little
house
to
the
intolerable
grumbling
of
an
old
who
can
hardly
wait
for
thy
death
in
order
that
she
may
sell
thy
boots
for
a
song
yes
one
involuntarily
says
with
the
russian
philosopher
how
is
one
to
know
what
he
does
not
know
until
march
a
white
winter
day
i
have
read
over
what
i
wrote
yesterday
and
came
near
tearing
up
the
whole
it
seems
to
me
that
my
style
of
narrative
is
too
protracted
and
too
mawkish
however
as
my
remaining
memories
of
that
period
present
nothing
cheerful
save
the
joy
of
that
peculiar
nature
which
lérmontoff
had
in
view
when
he
said
that
it
is
a
cheerful
and
a
painful
thing
to
touch
the
ulcers
of
ancient
wounds
then
why
should
not
i
observe
myself
but
i
must
not
impose
upon
kindness
therefore
i
will
continue
without
mawkishness
for
the
space
of
a
whole
week
after
that
stroll
outside
the
town
my
position
did
not
improve
in
the
least
although
the
change
in
liza
became
more
perceptible
every
day
as
i
have
already
stated
i
interpreted
this
change
in
the
most
favourable
possible
light
for
myself
the
misfortune
of
solitary
and
timid
men
those
who
are
timid
through
consists
precisely
in
this
that
they
having
eyes
and
even
keeping
them
staring
wide
open
see
nothing
or
see
it
in
a
false
light
as
though
through
coloured
glasses
and
their
own
thoughts
and
observations
hinder
them
at
every
step
in
the
beginning
of
our
acquaintance
liza
had
treated
me
trustingly
and
frankly
like
a
child
perhaps
even
in
her
liking
for
me
there
was
something
of
simple
childish
affection
but
when
that
strange
almost
sudden
crisis
took
place
in
her
after
a
short
perplexity
she
felt
herself
embarrassed
in
my
presence
she
turned
away
from
me
involuntarily
and
at
the
same
time
grew
sad
and
pensive
she
was
expecting
what
she
herself
did
not
know
but
i
i
as
i
have
already
said
rejoiced
at
that
crisis
as
god
is
my
witness
i
almost
swooned
with
rapture
as
the
saying
is
however
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
any
one
else
in
my
place
might
have
been
deceived
also
who
is
devoid
of
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
all
this
became
clear
to
me
only
after
a
time
when
i
was
compelled
to
fold
my
injured
wings
which
were
not
any
too
strong
at
best
the
misunderstanding
which
arose
between
liza
and
me
lasted
for
a
whole
week
and
there
is
nothing
surprising
about
that
it
has
been
my
lot
to
be
a
witness
of
misunderstandings
which
have
lasted
for
years
and
years
and
who
was
it
that
said
that
only
the
true
is
real
a
lie
is
as
tenacious
of
life
as
is
the
truth
if
not
more
so
it
is
a
fact
i
remember
that
even
during
that
week
i
had
a
pang
now
and
then
but
a
lonely
man
like
myself
i
will
say
once
more
is
as
incapable
of
understanding
what
is
going
on
within
him
as
he
is
of
comprehending
what
is
going
on
before
his
eyes
yes
and
more
than
that
is
love
a
natural
feeling
is
it
natural
to
a
man
to
love
love
is
a
malady
and
for
a
malady
the
law
is
not
written
suppose
my
heart
did
contract
unpleasantly
within
me
at
times
but
then
everything
in
me
was
turned
upside
down
how
is
a
man
to
know
under
such
circumstances
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
what
is
the
cause
what
is
the
significance
of
every
separate
sensation
but
be
that
as
it
may
all
these
misunderstandings
forebodings
and
hopes
were
resolved
in
the
following
manner
one
day
it
was
in
the
morning
about
eleven
before
i
had
contrived
to
set
my
foot
in
ozhógin
anteroom
an
unfamiliar
ringing
voice
resounded
in
the
hall
the
door
flew
open
and
accompanied
by
the
master
of
the
house
there
appeared
on
the
threshold
a
tall
stately
man
of
who
hastily
threw
on
his
military
cloak
which
was
lying
on
the
bench
took
an
affectionate
leave
of
kiríll
matvyéevitch
touched
his
cap
negligently
as
he
passed
me
and
vanished
clinking
his
spurs
who
is
that
i
asked
ozhógin
prince
replied
the
latter
with
a
troubled
face
he
has
been
sent
from
petersburg
to
receive
the
recruits
but
where
are
those
servants
he
went
on
with
vexation
there
was
no
one
to
put
on
his
cloak
we
entered
the
hall
has
he
been
here
long
i
inquired
they
say
he
came
yesterday
evening
i
offered
him
a
room
in
my
house
but
he
declined
it
however
he
seems
to
be
a
very
nice
young
fellow
did
he
stay
long
with
you
about
an
hour
he
asked
me
to
introduce
him
to
olympiáda
nikítichna
and
did
you
introduce
him
certainly
and
did
he
make
acquaintance
with
lizavéta
kiríllovna
yes
he
made
her
acquaintance
of
course
i
said
nothing
for
a
while
has
he
come
to
remain
long
do
you
know
yes
i
think
he
will
be
obliged
to
stay
here
more
than
a
fortnight
and
kiríll
matvyéevitch
ran
off
to
dress
i
paced
up
and
down
the
hall
several
times
i
do
not
remember
that
prince
arrival
produced
any
special
impression
on
me
at
the
time
except
that
unpleasant
sensation
which
usually
takes
possession
of
us
at
the
appearance
of
a
new
face
in
our
domestic
circle
perhaps
that
feeling
was
mingled
with
something
in
the
nature
of
envy
of
the
timid
and
obscure
moscow
man
for
the
brilliant
officer
from
the
prince
i
thought
is
a
dandy
of
the
capital
he
will
look
down
on
i
had
not
seen
him
for
more
than
a
minute
but
i
had
managed
to
note
that
he
was
handsome
alert
and
after
pacing
the
hall
for
a
while
i
came
to
a
halt
at
last
in
front
of
a
mirror
pulled
from
my
pocket
a
tiny
comb
imparted
to
my
hair
a
picturesque
disorder
and
as
sometimes
happens
suddenly
became
engrossed
in
the
contemplation
of
my
own
visage
i
remember
that
my
attention
was
concentrated
with
particular
solicitude
on
my
nose
the
rather
flabby
and
undefined
outline
of
that
feature
was
affording
me
no
special
gratification
when
all
of
a
sudden
in
the
dark
depths
of
the
inclined
glass
which
reflected
almost
the
entire
room
the
door
opened
and
the
graceful
figure
of
liza
made
its
appearance
i
do
not
know
why
i
did
not
stir
and
kept
the
same
expression
on
my
face
liza
craned
her
head
forward
gazed
attentively
at
me
and
elevating
her
eyebrows
biting
her
lips
and
holding
her
breath
like
a
person
who
is
delighted
that
he
has
not
been
seen
cautiously
retreated
and
softly
drew
the
door
to
after
her
the
door
creaked
faintly
liza
shuddered
and
stood
on
the
spot
i
did
not
move
again
she
pulled
at
the
and
disappeared
there
was
no
possibility
of
doubt
the
expression
of
liza
face
at
the
sight
of
my
person
denoted
nothing
except
a
desire
to
beat
a
successful
retreat
to
avoid
an
unpleasant
meeting
the
swift
gleam
of
pleasure
which
i
succeeded
in
detecting
in
her
eyes
when
she
thought
that
she
really
had
succeeded
in
escaping
unperceived
all
that
said
but
too
clearly
that
young
girl
was
not
in
love
with
me
for
a
long
long
time
i
could
not
withdraw
my
gaze
from
the
motionless
dumb
door
which
again
presented
itself
as
a
white
spot
in
the
depths
of
the
mirror
i
tried
to
smile
at
my
own
upright
figure
hung
my
head
returned
home
and
flung
myself
on
the
divan
i
felt
remarkably
heavy
at
heart
so
heavy
that
i
could
not
weep
and
what
was
there
to
weep
about
can
it
be
i
kept
reiterating
incessantly
as
i
lay
like
a
dead
man
on
my
back
and
with
my
hands
folded
on
my
breast
can
it
be
how
do
you
like
that
can
it
be
march
a
thaw
when
on
the
following
day
after
long
hesitation
and
inward
quailing
i
entered
the
familiar
of
the
ozhógins
i
was
no
longer
the
same
man
whom
they
had
known
for
the
space
of
three
weeks
all
my
former
habits
from
which
i
had
begun
to
wean
myself
under
the
influence
of
an
emotion
which
was
new
to
me
had
suddenly
made
their
appearance
again
and
taken
entire
possession
of
me
like
the
owners
returning
to
their
house
people
like
myself
are
generally
guided
not
so
much
by
positive
facts
as
by
their
own
impressions
i
who
no
longer
ago
than
the
previous
evening
had
been
dreaming
of
the
raptures
of
mutual
love
cherished
not
the
slightest
doubt
as
to
my
own
unhappiness
and
was
in
utter
despair
although
i
myself
was
not
able
to
discover
any
reasonable
pretext
for
my
despair
i
could
not
be
jealous
of
prince
and
whatever
merits
he
might
possess
his
mere
arrival
was
not
sufficient
instantly
to
extirpate
liza
inclination
for
me
but
stay
did
that
inclination
exist
i
recalled
the
past
and
the
stroll
in
the
forest
i
asked
myself
and
the
expression
of
her
face
in
the
mirror
but
i
went
on
the
stroll
in
the
forest
apparently
phew
good
heavens
what
an
insignificant
being
i
am
i
exclaimed
aloud
at
last
this
is
a
specimen
of
the
ideas
which
returning
a
thousand
times
revolved
in
a
monotonous
whirlwind
in
my
head
i
repeat
i
returned
to
the
ozhógins
the
same
mistrustful
suspicious
constrained
person
that
i
had
been
from
my
childhood
i
found
the
whole
family
in
the
bizmyónkoff
was
sitting
there
also
in
one
corner
all
appeared
to
be
in
high
spirits
ozhógin
in
particular
was
fairly
beaming
and
his
first
words
were
to
communicate
to
me
that
prince
had
spent
the
whole
of
the
preceding
evening
with
well
i
said
to
myself
now
i
understand
why
you
are
in
such
good
humour
i
must
confess
that
the
prince
second
call
puzzled
me
i
had
not
expected
that
generally
speaking
people
like
me
expect
everything
in
the
world
except
that
which
ought
to
happen
in
the
ordinary
run
of
things
i
sulked
and
assumed
the
aspect
of
a
wounded
but
magnanimous
man
i
wanted
to
punish
liza
for
her
ungraciousness
from
which
moreover
it
must
be
concluded
that
nevertheless
i
was
not
yet
in
utter
despair
they
say
in
some
cases
when
you
are
really
beloved
it
is
even
advantageous
to
torture
the
adored
object
but
in
my
position
it
was
unutterably
stupid
liza
in
the
most
innocent
manner
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
me
only
old
madame
ozhógin
noticed
my
solemn
taciturnity
and
anxiously
inquired
after
my
health
of
course
i
answered
her
with
a
bitter
smile
that
i
was
perfectly
well
thank
god
ozhógin
continued
to
dilate
on
the
subject
of
his
visitor
but
observing
that
i
answered
him
reluctantly
he
addressed
himself
chiefly
to
bizmyónkoff
who
was
listening
to
him
with
great
attention
when
a
footman
entered
and
announced
prince
the
master
of
the
house
instantly
sprang
to
his
feet
and
rushed
forth
to
welcome
him
liza
on
whom
i
immediately
darted
an
eagle
glance
blushed
with
pleasure
and
fidgeted
about
on
her
chair
the
prince
entered
perfumed
gay
amiable
as
i
am
not
composing
a
novel
for
the
indulgent
reader
but
simply
writing
for
my
own
pleasure
there
is
no
necessity
for
my
having
recourse
to
the
customary
devices
of
the
literary
gentlemen
so
i
will
say
at
once
without
further
procrastination
that
liza
from
the
very
first
day
fell
passionately
in
love
with
the
prince
and
the
prince
fell
in
love
with
her
partly
for
the
lack
of
anything
to
do
but
also
partly
because
liza
really
was
a
very
charming
creature
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
the
fact
that
they
fell
in
love
with
each
other
he
in
all
probability
had
not
in
the
least
expected
to
find
such
a
pearl
in
such
a
wretched
shell
i
am
speaking
of
the
town
of
and
she
up
to
that
time
had
never
beheld
even
in
her
dreams
anything
in
the
least
like
this
brilliant
clever
fascinating
aristocrat
after
the
preliminary
greetings
ozhógin
introduced
me
to
the
prince
who
treated
me
very
politely
as
a
rule
he
was
polite
to
every
one
and
despite
the
incommensurable
distance
which
existed
between
him
and
our
obscure
rural
circle
he
understood
not
only
how
to
avoid
embarrassing
any
one
but
even
to
have
the
appearance
of
being
our
equal
and
of
only
happening
to
live
in
petersburg
that
first
evening
oh
that
first
evening
in
the
happy
days
of
our
childhood
our
teachers
used
to
narrate
to
us
and
hold
up
to
us
as
an
example
of
manly
fortitude
the
young
lacedæmonian
who
having
stolen
a
fox
and
hidden
it
under
his
cloak
never
once
uttered
a
sound
but
permitted
the
animal
to
devour
all
his
entrails
and
thus
preferred
death
to
dishonour
i
can
find
no
better
expression
of
my
unutterable
sufferings
in
the
course
of
that
evening
when
for
the
first
time
i
beheld
the
prince
by
liza
side
my
persistent
constrained
smile
my
anguished
attention
my
stupid
taciturnity
my
painful
and
vain
longing
to
depart
all
this
in
all
probability
was
extremely
noticeable
in
its
way
not
one
fox
alone
was
ravaging
my
vitals
jealousy
envy
the
consciousness
of
my
own
insignificance
and
impotent
rage
were
rending
me
i
could
not
but
admit
that
the
prince
was
really
a
very
amiable
young
man
i
devoured
him
with
my
eyes
i
really
believe
that
i
forgot
to
wink
as
i
gazed
at
him
he
did
not
chat
with
liza
exclusively
but
of
course
he
talked
for
her
alone
i
must
have
bored
him
extremely
he
probably
soon
divined
that
he
had
to
do
with
a
discarded
lover
but
out
of
compassion
for
me
and
also
from
a
profound
sense
of
my
perfect
harmlessness
he
treated
me
with
extraordinary
gentleness
you
can
imagine
how
that
hurt
me
i
remember
that
in
the
course
of
the
evening
i
tried
to
efface
my
fault
i
do
not
laugh
at
me
whoever
you
may
be
under
whose
eyes
these
lines
may
chance
to
fall
especially
as
this
was
my
final
dream
i
suddenly
took
it
into
my
head
god
is
my
witness
among
the
varied
torments
that
liza
was
trying
to
punish
me
for
my
arrogant
coldness
at
the
beginning
of
my
visit
that
she
was
angry
with
me
and
was
flirting
with
the
prince
merely
out
of
vexation
at
me
i
seized
a
convenient
opportunity
and
approaching
her
with
a
meek
but
caressing
smile
i
murmured
enough
forgive
me
however
i
do
not
ask
it
because
i
am
afraid
and
without
awaiting
her
answer
i
suddenly
imparted
to
my
face
an
unusually
vivacious
and
easy
expression
gave
a
wry
laugh
threw
my
hand
up
over
my
head
in
the
direction
of
the
ceiling
i
remember
that
i
was
trying
to
adjust
my
neckcloth
and
was
even
on
the
point
of
wheeling
round
on
one
foot
as
much
as
to
say
all
is
over
i
in
fine
spirits
let
every
one
be
in
fine
spirits
but
i
did
not
wheel
round
nevertheless
because
i
was
afraid
of
falling
owing
to
an
unnatural
stiffness
in
my
knees
liza
did
not
understand
me
in
the
least
looked
into
my
face
with
surprise
smiled
hurriedly
as
though
desirous
of
getting
rid
of
me
as
promptly
as
possible
and
again
approached
the
prince
blind
and
deaf
as
i
was
i
could
not
but
inwardly
admit
that
she
was
not
at
all
angry
nor
vexed
with
me
at
that
moment
she
simply
was
not
thinking
about
me
the
blow
was
decisive
my
last
hopes
crumbled
to
ruin
with
a
crash
as
a
block
of
ice
penetrated
with
the
spring
sun
suddenly
crumbles
into
tiny
fragments
i
had
received
a
blow
on
the
head
at
the
first
assault
and
like
the
prussians
at
jena
in
one
day
i
lost
everything
no
she
was
not
angry
with
me
alas
on
the
contrary
she
herself
i
could
see
that
was
being
undermined
as
with
a
billow
like
a
young
sapling
which
has
already
half
deserted
the
bank
she
bent
eagerly
forward
over
the
flood
ready
to
surrender
to
it
both
the
first
blossoming
of
her
spring
and
her
whole
life
any
one
to
whose
lot
it
has
fallen
to
be
a
witness
to
such
an
infatuation
has
lived
through
bitter
moments
if
he
himself
loved
and
was
not
beloved
i
shall
forever
remember
the
devouring
attention
the
tender
gaiety
the
innocent
the
glance
and
already
womanly
the
happy
smile
which
blossomed
forth
as
it
were
and
never
left
the
lips
and
the
blushing
cheeks
everything
of
which
liza
had
had
a
dim
foreboding
during
our
stroll
in
the
grove
had
now
come
to
pass
and
she
surrendering
herself
wholly
to
love
had
at
the
same
time
grown
quiet
and
sparkling
like
young
wine
which
has
ceased
to
ferment
because
its
time
has
come
i
had
the
patience
to
sit
out
that
first
evening
and
the
evenings
which
followed
all
to
the
very
end
i
could
cherish
no
hope
whatsoever
liza
and
the
prince
grew
more
and
more
attached
to
each
other
with
every
day
that
passed
but
i
positively
lost
all
sense
of
my
own
dignity
and
could
not
tear
myself
away
from
the
spectacle
of
my
unhappiness
i
remember
that
one
day
i
made
an
effort
not
to
go
gave
myself
my
word
of
honour
in
the
morning
that
i
would
remain
at
home
and
at
eight
in
the
evening
i
usually
went
out
at
seven
i
jumped
up
like
a
lunatic
put
on
my
hat
and
ran
panting
to
kiríll
matvyéevitch
my
position
was
extremely
awkward
i
maintained
obdurate
silence
and
sometimes
for
days
at
a
stretch
never
uttered
a
sound
i
have
never
been
distinguished
for
eloquence
as
i
have
already
said
but
now
every
bit
of
sense
i
had
seemed
to
fly
away
in
the
presence
of
the
prince
and
i
remained
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
moreover
in
private
i
forced
my
unhappy
brain
to
toil
to
such
a
degree
slowly
pondering
over
everything
i
had
marked
or
noted
in
the
course
of
the
preceding
day
that
when
i
returned
to
the
ozhógins
i
hardly
had
enough
strength
left
to
continue
my
observations
they
spared
me
as
they
would
a
sick
man
i
saw
that
every
morning
i
reached
a
fresh
definitive
decision
which
had
chiefly
been
hatched
out
during
a
sleepless
night
now
i
prepared
to
have
an
explanation
with
liza
to
give
her
some
friendly
advice
but
when
i
happened
to
be
alone
with
her
my
tongue
suddenly
ceased
to
act
as
though
it
had
congealed
and
we
both
painfully
awaited
the
appearance
of
a
third
person
then
again
i
wanted
to
flee
for
good
and
all
leaving
behind
me
for
the
object
of
my
affections
of
course
a
letter
filled
with
reproaches
and
one
day
i
set
about
that
letter
but
the
sense
of
justice
had
not
yet
quite
vanished
from
within
me
i
understood
that
i
had
no
right
to
upbraid
any
one
for
anything
and
flung
my
note
into
the
fire
again
i
suddenly
offered
the
whole
of
myself
as
a
sacrifice
in
magnanimous
fashion
and
gave
liza
my
blessing
wishing
her
happiness
in
her
love
and
smiled
in
a
gentle
and
friendly
way
on
the
prince
from
a
corner
but
the
lovers
not
only
did
not
thank
me
for
my
sacrifice
they
did
not
even
perceive
it
and
evidently
stood
in
no
need
either
of
my
blessings
or
of
my
smiles
then
with
vexation
i
suddenly
passed
over
into
the
diametrically
opposite
frame
of
mind
i
promised
myself
as
i
swathed
myself
in
my
cloak
spanish
fashion
to
cut
the
lucky
rival
throat
from
round
a
corner
and
with
the
joy
of
a
wild
beast
i
pictured
to
myself
liza
despair
but
in
the
first
place
in
the
town
of
there
were
very
few
such
corners
and
in
the
second
place
a
board
fence
a
a
policeman
in
the
distance
no
at
such
a
corner
as
that
it
would
be
more
seemly
to
peddle
rings
of
bread
than
to
shed
human
blood
i
must
confess
that
among
other
means
of
deliverance
as
i
very
indefinitely
expressed
it
when
holding
a
conference
with
myself
i
thought
of
appealing
straight
to
ozhógin
of
directing
the
attention
of
that
nobleman
to
the
dangerous
position
of
his
daughter
to
the
sad
consequences
of
her
frivolity
i
even
began
to
talk
with
him
one
day
on
the
very
ticklish
subject
but
framed
my
speech
so
craftily
and
obscurely
that
he
listened
and
listened
to
me
and
suddenly
as
though
awaking
from
sleep
swiftly
rubbed
the
palm
of
his
hand
all
over
his
face
not
sparing
even
his
nose
snorted
and
walked
away
from
me
it
is
needless
to
say
that
on
adopting
that
decision
i
assured
myself
that
i
was
acting
from
the
most
disinterested
motives
that
i
was
desirous
of
the
universal
welfare
that
i
was
fulfilling
the
duty
of
a
friend
of
the
family
but
i
venture
to
think
that
even
if
kiríll
matvyéevitch
had
not
cut
short
my
effusions
i
should
still
have
lacked
the
courage
to
finish
my
monologue
i
sometimes
undertook
with
the
pompousness
of
an
ancient
sage
to
weigh
the
prince
merits
i
sometimes
comforted
myself
with
the
hope
that
it
was
merely
a
passing
fancy
that
liza
would
come
to
her
senses
that
her
love
was
not
genuine
love
oh
no
in
a
word
i
do
not
know
of
a
thought
over
which
i
did
not
brood
at
that
time
one
remedy
alone
i
frankly
confess
never
entered
my
head
namely
it
never
once
occurred
to
me
to
commit
suicide
why
that
did
not
occur
to
me
i
do
not
know
perhaps
even
then
i
had
a
foreboding
that
i
had
not
long
to
live
in
any
case
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
under
such
untoward
conditions
my
conduct
my
behaviour
toward
other
people
was
more
characterised
by
unnaturalness
and
constraint
than
ever
even
old
lady
ozhógin
that
being
began
to
shun
me
and
at
times
did
not
know
from
which
side
to
approach
me
bizmyónkoff
always
courteous
and
ready
to
be
of
service
avoided
me
it
also
seemed
to
me
then
that
in
him
i
had
a
that
he
also
loved
liza
but
he
never
replied
to
my
hints
and
in
general
talked
to
me
with
reluctance
the
prince
behaved
in
a
very
friendly
manner
to
him
i
may
say
that
the
prince
respected
him
neither
bizmyónkoff
nor
i
interfered
with
the
prince
and
liza
but
he
did
not
shun
them
as
i
did
he
did
not
look
like
a
wolf
nor
like
a
victim
and
gladly
joined
them
whenever
they
wished
it
he
did
not
distinguish
himself
particularly
by
jocularity
on
such
occasions
it
is
true
but
even
in
times
past
there
had
been
a
quiet
element
in
his
mirth
in
this
manner
about
two
weeks
passed
the
prince
was
not
only
and
clever
he
played
on
the
piano
sang
drew
very
respectably
and
knew
how
to
narrate
well
his
anecdotes
drawn
from
the
highest
circles
of
society
in
the
capital
always
produced
a
strong
impression
on
the
hearers
which
was
all
the
more
powerful
because
he
himself
did
not
seem
to
attribute
any
particular
importance
to
them
the
consequence
of
this
guile
if
you
choose
to
call
it
so
on
the
prince
part
was
that
in
the
course
of
his
brief
sojourn
in
the
town
of
he
absolutely
bewitched
the
whole
of
society
there
it
is
always
very
easy
for
a
man
from
the
highest
circles
to
bewitch
us
the
prince
frequent
calls
on
the
ozhógins
he
spent
his
evenings
at
their
house
as
a
matter
of
course
aroused
the
envy
of
the
other
nobles
and
officials
but
the
prince
being
a
man
of
the
world
and
clever
did
not
neglect
a
single
one
of
them
called
on
all
of
them
said
at
least
one
pleasant
word
to
all
the
dames
and
young
ladies
permitted
himself
to
be
stuffed
with
viands
and
treated
to
vile
wines
with
magnificent
appellations
in
a
word
behaved
himself
admirably
cautiously
and
cleverly
prince
was
altogether
a
man
of
cheerful
disposition
sociable
amiable
by
inclination
and
as
a
matter
of
calculation
also
how
was
it
possible
for
him
to
be
otherwise
than
a
complete
success
in
every
way
from
the
time
of
his
arrival
every
one
in
the
house
had
thought
that
the
time
flew
by
with
remarkable
swiftness
everything
went
splendidly
old
ozhógin
although
he
pretended
not
to
notice
anything
was
in
all
probability
secretly
rubbing
his
hands
at
the
thought
of
having
such
a
the
prince
himself
was
conducting
the
whole
affair
very
quietly
and
decorously
when
all
of
a
sudden
an
unforeseen
event
until
i
am
weary
these
reminiscences
chafe
me
even
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
teréntievna
thought
that
my
nose
had
grown
even
more
pointed
and
that
a
bad
sign
they
say
march
the
thaw
continues
matters
were
in
the
condition
the
prince
and
liza
loved
each
other
the
elder
ozhógins
were
waiting
to
see
what
would
happen
bizmyónkoff
was
present
also
nothing
else
could
be
said
of
him
i
was
flopping
like
a
fish
on
the
ice
and
keeping
watch
to
the
best
of
my
ability
i
remember
that
at
that
time
i
appointed
to
myself
the
task
of
at
least
not
allowing
liza
to
perish
in
the
snare
of
the
seducer
and
in
consequence
thereof
i
had
begun
to
pay
particular
attention
to
the
and
the
fatal
back
entrance
although
on
the
other
hand
i
sometimes
dreamed
for
whole
nights
together
about
the
touching
magnanimity
with
which
in
the
course
of
time
i
would
extend
my
hand
to
the
deluded
victim
and
say
to
her
the
wily
man
has
betrayed
thee
but
i
am
thy
faithful
friend
let
us
forget
the
past
and
be
happy
when
suddenly
a
joyful
piece
of
news
was
disseminated
throughout
the
town
the
marshal
of
nobility
for
the
county
intended
to
give
a
large
ball
in
honour
of
the
respected
visitor
at
his
own
estate
gornostáevka
also
called
gubnyakóva
all
the
hierarchies
and
powers
of
the
town
of
received
invitations
beginning
with
the
chief
of
police
and
ending
with
the
apothecary
a
remarkably
german
with
cruel
pretensions
to
the
ability
to
speak
russian
purely
in
consequence
of
which
he
was
constantly
using
violent
expressions
with
absolute
inappropriateness
as
for
instance
devil
take
me
i
feel
a
dashing
fine
fellow
terrible
preparations
began
as
was
fitting
one
sold
sixteen
jars
of
pomade
with
the
inscription
à
la
jesmin
with
the
russian
character
denoting
the
hard
pronunciation
after
the
the
young
ladies
supplied
themselves
with
stiff
gowns
torturingly
tight
at
the
and
with
promontories
on
the
stomach
the
mammas
erected
on
their
own
heads
formidable
decorations
under
the
pretext
that
they
were
caps
the
bustling
fathers
lay
without
their
hind
legs
as
the
saying
the
day
arrived
at
last
i
was
among
those
invited
the
distance
from
the
town
to
gornostáevka
was
reckoned
at
nine
versts
kiríla
matvyéevitch
offered
me
a
seat
in
his
carriage
but
i
declined
thus
do
chastised
children
desirous
of
revenging
themselves
well
on
their
parents
refuse
their
favourite
viands
at
table
moreover
i
felt
that
my
presence
would
embarrass
liza
bizmyónkoff
took
my
place
the
prince
drove
out
in
his
own
calash
i
in
a
miserable
drozhky
which
i
had
hired
at
an
exorbitant
price
for
this
festive
occasion
i
will
not
describe
the
ball
everything
about
it
was
as
usual
musicians
with
remarkably
false
horns
in
the
gallery
flustered
landed
proprietors
with
antiquated
families
lilac
slimy
orgeat
men
in
patched
boots
and
knitted
cotton
gloves
provincial
lions
with
faces
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
and
all
this
little
world
circled
round
its
sun
round
the
prince
lost
in
the
throng
unnoticed
even
by
the
maidens
of
with
pimples
on
their
brows
and
blue
flowers
on
their
temples
i
kept
incessantly
gazing
now
at
the
prince
now
at
liza
she
was
very
charmingly
dressed
and
very
pretty
that
evening
they
only
danced
together
twice
he
danced
the
mazurka
with
her
is
true
but
at
all
events
so
it
seemed
to
there
existed
between
them
a
certain
mysterious
unbroken
communication
even
when
he
was
not
looking
at
her
was
not
talking
to
her
he
seemed
constantly
to
be
addressing
her
and
her
alone
he
was
handsome
and
brilliant
and
charming
with
others
for
her
alone
she
was
evidently
conscious
that
she
was
the
queen
of
the
ball
and
beloved
her
face
simultaneously
beamed
with
childish
joy
and
innocent
pride
and
then
suddenly
was
lighted
up
with
a
different
a
more
profound
feeling
she
exhaled
an
atmosphere
of
happiness
i
observed
all
this
it
was
not
the
first
time
i
had
had
occasion
to
watch
them
at
first
this
greatly
pained
me
then
it
seemed
to
touch
me
and
at
last
it
enraged
me
i
suddenly
felt
myself
remarkably
malicious
and
i
remember
i
rejoiced
wonderfully
over
this
new
sensation
and
even
conceived
a
certain
respect
for
myself
let
show
them
that
we
have
perished
yet
i
said
to
myself
when
the
first
sounds
summoning
to
the
mazurka
thundered
out
i
calmly
glanced
around
coldly
and
with
much
ease
of
manner
approached
a
young
lady
with
a
red
and
shining
nose
an
awkwardly
gaping
mouth
which
looked
as
though
it
had
been
unhooked
and
a
sinewy
neck
which
reminded
one
of
the
handle
of
a
approached
her
and
curtly
clicking
my
heels
together
invited
her
for
the
dance
she
wore
a
pink
gown
which
seemed
to
have
faded
recently
and
not
quite
completely
above
her
head
quivered
some
sort
of
a
faded
melancholy
fly
on
a
very
thick
brass
spring
and
altogether
the
young
woman
was
impregnated
through
and
through
if
one
may
so
express
one
self
with
a
sort
of
sour
boredom
and
antiquated
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
evening
she
had
not
stirred
from
her
seat
no
one
had
thought
of
asking
her
to
dance
one
youth
in
default
of
any
other
partner
had
been
on
the
point
of
appealing
to
this
young
woman
and
had
already
taken
one
step
in
her
direction
but
had
bethought
himself
taken
one
look
and
briskly
concealed
himself
in
the
crowd
you
can
imagine
with
what
joyful
surprise
she
accepted
my
proposal
i
solemnly
led
her
the
whole
length
of
the
hall
found
two
chairs
and
seated
myself
with
her
in
the
circle
of
the
mazurka
the
tenth
pair
almost
opposite
the
prince
to
whom
of
course
the
first
place
had
been
conceded
the
prince
as
i
have
already
said
was
dancing
with
liza
neither
my
partner
nor
i
were
incommoded
with
invitations
consequently
we
had
plenty
of
time
for
conversation
truth
to
tell
my
lady
was
not
distinguished
by
ability
to
utter
words
in
coherent
speech
she
employed
her
mouth
more
for
the
execution
of
a
strange
downward
smile
hitherto
unbeheld
by
me
at
the
same
time
she
rolled
her
eyes
upward
as
though
some
invisible
force
were
stretching
her
face
but
i
had
no
need
of
her
eloquence
fortunately
i
felt
vicious
and
my
partner
did
not
inspire
me
with
timidity
i
set
to
criticising
everything
and
everybody
in
the
world
laying
special
stress
on
from
the
capital
and
petersburg
fops
and
waxed
so
angry
at
last
that
my
lady
gradually
ceased
to
smile
and
instead
of
rolling
her
eyes
upward
she
suddenly
began
with
amazement
it
must
have
been
to
look
and
in
such
a
queer
way
to
boot
as
though
she
had
perceived
for
the
first
time
that
she
had
a
nose
on
her
face
and
my
next
neighbour
one
of
those
lions
of
whom
i
have
spoken
above
more
than
once
scanned
me
with
a
glance
even
turned
to
me
with
the
expression
of
an
actor
on
the
stage
who
has
waked
up
in
an
unknown
land
as
much
as
to
say
art
thou
still
at
it
however
while
i
sang
like
a
nightingale
as
the
saying
is
i
still
continued
to
watch
the
prince
and
liza
they
were
constantly
invited
but
i
suffered
less
when
both
of
them
were
dancing
and
even
when
they
were
sitting
side
by
side
and
chatting
with
each
other
and
smiling
with
that
gentle
smile
which
refuses
to
leave
the
face
of
happy
lovers
even
then
i
was
not
so
greatly
pained
but
when
liza
was
fluttering
through
the
hall
with
some
gallant
dandy
and
the
prince
with
her
blue
gauze
scarf
on
his
knees
thoughtfully
followed
her
with
his
eyes
as
though
admiring
his
conquest
then
oh
then
i
experienced
unbearable
tortures
and
in
my
vexation
i
emitted
such
malicious
remarks
that
the
pupils
of
my
partner
eyes
reclined
completely
from
both
sides
on
her
nose
in
the
meantime
the
mazurka
was
drawing
to
a
close
they
began
to
execute
the
figure
known
as
la
confidente
in
this
figure
the
lady
seats
herself
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
chooses
another
lady
for
her
confidante
and
whispers
in
her
ear
the
name
of
the
gentleman
with
whom
she
wishes
to
dance
the
cavalier
leads
up
to
her
the
dancers
one
by
one
and
the
confidante
refuses
them
until
at
last
the
happy
man
who
has
already
been
designated
makes
his
appearance
liza
sat
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
and
chose
the
daughter
of
the
hostess
one
of
those
young
girls
of
whom
it
is
said
that
they
are
god
bless
them
the
prince
began
to
search
for
the
chosen
man
in
vain
did
he
present
about
half
a
score
of
young
men
the
hostess
daughter
refused
them
all
with
a
pleasant
smile
and
at
last
had
recourse
to
me
something
unusual
took
place
in
me
at
that
moment
i
seemed
to
wink
with
my
whole
body
and
tried
to
decline
nevertheless
i
rose
and
went
the
prince
conducted
me
to
liza
she
did
not
even
glance
at
me
the
daughter
shook
her
head
in
negation
the
prince
turned
toward
me
and
prompted
probably
by
the
expression
of
my
face
made
me
a
profound
bow
this
mocking
reverence
this
refusal
presented
to
me
by
my
triumphant
rival
his
negligent
smile
liza
indifferent
inattention
all
this
provoked
an
explosion
on
my
part
i
stepped
up
to
the
prince
and
whispered
in
a
frenzied
rage
i
think
you
are
permitting
yourself
to
jeer
at
me
the
prince
stared
at
me
with
scornful
surprise
again
took
me
by
the
hand
and
with
the
air
of
leading
me
back
to
my
seat
replied
coldly
i
yes
you
you
i
went
on
in
a
whisper
obeying
him
nevertheless
that
is
to
say
following
him
to
my
seat
you
but
i
do
not
intend
to
allow
any
frivolous
petersburg
upstart
the
prince
smiled
calmly
almost
patronisingly
gripped
my
hand
hard
whispered
i
understand
you
but
this
is
not
the
proper
place
we
will
talk
it
over
turned
away
from
me
approached
bizmyónkoff
and
led
him
to
liza
the
pale
little
petty
official
proved
to
be
the
chosen
cavalier
liza
rose
to
meet
him
as
i
sat
beside
my
partner
with
the
melancholy
fly
on
her
head
i
felt
myself
almost
a
hero
my
heart
thumped
violently
within
me
my
bosom
swelled
nobly
under
my
starched
my
breath
came
fast
and
deep
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
stared
at
the
adjacent
lion
in
so
magnificent
a
manner
that
he
involuntarily
wiggled
the
leg
which
was
turned
toward
me
having
rid
myself
of
this
man
i
ran
my
eyes
over
the
circle
of
dancers
it
seemed
to
me
that
two
or
three
gentlemen
were
gazing
at
me
not
without
amazement
but
on
the
whole
my
conversation
with
the
prince
had
not
been
noticed
my
rival
was
already
seated
on
his
chair
perfectly
composed
and
with
his
former
smile
on
his
face
bizmyónkoff
led
liza
to
her
place
she
gave
him
a
friendly
nod
and
immediately
turned
to
the
prince
as
it
seemed
to
me
with
a
certain
anxiety
but
he
laughed
in
response
waved
his
hand
gracefully
and
must
have
said
something
very
agreeable
to
her
for
she
flushed
all
over
with
pleasure
dropped
her
eyes
and
then
riveted
them
on
him
once
more
with
affectionate
reproach
the
heroic
frame
of
mind
which
had
suddenly
developed
in
me
did
not
disappear
until
the
end
of
the
mazurka
but
i
made
no
more
jests
and
did
not
criticise
and
merely
cast
a
severe
and
gloomy
glance
from
time
to
time
at
my
lady
who
was
evidently
beginning
to
be
afraid
of
me
and
was
reduced
to
a
state
of
complete
stammering
and
winked
incessantly
when
i
led
her
to
the
natural
stronghold
of
her
mother
a
very
fat
woman
with
a
red
having
handed
over
the
frightened
young
girl
as
behooved
me
i
walked
off
to
the
window
clasped
my
hands
and
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
i
waited
a
good
while
the
prince
was
constantly
surrounded
by
the
host
precisely
that
surrounded
as
england
is
surrounded
by
the
sea
not
to
mention
the
other
members
of
the
county
marshal
of
the
nobility
family
and
the
other
guests
and
moreover
he
could
not
without
arousing
universal
surprise
approach
such
an
insignificant
man
as
i
and
enter
into
conversation
with
him
this
insignificance
of
mine
i
remember
was
even
a
source
of
delight
to
me
then
fiddlesticks
i
thought
as
i
watched
him
turning
courteously
now
to
one
now
to
another
respected
personage
who
sought
the
honour
of
being
noticed
by
him
if
only
for
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
as
the
poets
say
fiddlesticks
my
dear
fellow
thou
wilt
come
to
me
by
and
by
for
i
have
insulted
thee
at
last
the
prince
having
cleverly
got
rid
of
the
crowd
of
his
adorers
strode
past
me
darted
a
glance
not
exactly
at
the
window
nor
yet
exactly
at
my
hair
was
on
the
point
of
turning
away
and
suddenly
came
to
a
halt
as
though
he
had
just
remembered
something
akh
yes
he
said
addressing
me
with
a
smile
by
the
way
i
have
a
little
matter
of
business
with
you
two
landed
proprietors
the
most
persistent
of
all
who
were
obstinately
following
up
the
prince
probably
thought
that
the
little
matter
of
business
was
connected
with
the
service
and
respectfully
retreated
the
prince
put
his
arm
in
mine
and
led
me
to
one
side
my
heart
thumped
in
my
breast
you
he
began
drawling
out
the
word
and
staring
at
my
chin
with
a
contemptuous
expression
which
strange
to
say
was
infinitely
becoming
to
his
fresh
handsome
face
you
said
something
insolent
to
me
i
believe
i
said
what
i
thought
i
retorted
raising
my
voice
ssssh
speak
more
quietly
he
remarked
men
do
not
shout
perhaps
you
would
like
to
fight
with
me
that
is
your
affair
i
replied
drawing
myself
up
i
shall
be
compelled
to
call
you
out
he
said
carelessly
if
you
do
not
withdraw
your
expressions
i
have
no
intention
of
withdrawing
anything
i
retorted
proudly
really
he
remarked
not
without
a
sneering
in
that
case
he
went
on
after
a
brief
pause
i
shall
have
the
honour
to
send
my
second
to
you
very
well
sir
i
said
in
the
most
indifferent
tone
i
could
muster
the
prince
bowed
slightly
i
can
not
forbid
you
to
think
me
a
frivolous
man
he
added
arrogantly
narrowing
his
eyes
but
it
is
impossible
that
the
princes
should
be
upstarts
farewell
for
the
present
mr
mr
shtukatúrin
he
quickly
turned
his
back
on
me
and
again
approached
his
host
who
had
already
begun
to
grow
agitated
mr
shtukatúrin
my
name
is
tchulkatúrin
i
could
find
no
reply
to
make
to
this
last
insult
of
his
and
only
stared
after
him
in
a
violent
farewell
until
i
whispered
setting
my
teeth
and
immediately
hunted
up
an
officer
of
my
acquaintance
captain
koloberdyáeff
of
the
uhlans
a
desperate
carouser
and
a
splendid
fellow
narrated
to
him
in
a
few
words
my
quarrel
with
the
prince
and
asked
him
to
be
my
second
he
of
course
immediately
consented
and
i
wended
my
way
homeward
i
could
not
get
to
sleep
all
night
from
agitation
not
from
pusillanimity
i
am
no
coward
i
even
thought
very
little
indeed
about
the
impending
possibility
of
losing
my
life
that
highest
good
on
earth
according
to
the
germans
i
thought
of
liza
only
of
my
dead
hopes
of
what
i
ought
to
do
ought
i
to
try
to
kill
the
prince
i
asked
myself
and
of
course
wanted
to
kill
him
not
out
of
vengeance
but
out
of
a
desire
for
liza
good
but
she
will
not
survive
that
blow
i
went
on
no
it
will
be
better
to
let
him
kill
me
i
confess
that
it
was
also
pleasant
to
me
to
think
that
i
an
obscure
man
from
the
country
had
forced
so
important
a
personage
to
fight
a
duel
with
me
dawn
found
me
engrossed
in
these
cogitations
and
later
in
the
morning
koloberdyáeff
presented
himself
well
he
asked
me
noisily
entering
my
bedroom
and
where
the
prince
second
why
good
gracious
i
replied
with
vexation
it
only
seven
in
the
morning
now
i
presume
the
prince
is
still
fast
asleep
in
that
case
returned
the
irrepressible
order
them
to
give
me
some
tea
i
have
a
headache
from
last
doings
i
have
even
been
undressed
however
he
added
with
a
yawn
i
rarely
do
undress
anyway
tea
was
served
to
him
he
drank
six
glasses
with
rum
smoked
four
pipes
told
me
that
on
the
preceding
day
he
had
bought
for
a
song
a
horse
which
the
coachmen
had
given
up
as
a
bad
job
and
intended
to
break
it
in
by
tying
up
one
of
its
forelegs
and
fell
asleep
without
undressing
on
the
couch
with
his
pipe
still
in
his
mouth
i
rose
and
put
my
papers
in
order
one
note
of
invitation
from
liza
the
only
note
i
had
received
from
her
i
was
on
the
point
of
putting
in
my
breast
but
changed
my
mind
and
tossed
it
into
a
box
koloberdyáeff
was
snoring
faintly
with
his
head
hanging
down
from
the
leather
cushions
i
remember
that
i
surveyed
for
a
long
time
his
dishevelled
dashing
and
kindly
face
at
ten
my
servant
announced
the
arrival
of
bizmyónkoff
the
prince
had
selected
him
for
his
second
together
we
roused
the
captain
he
rose
stared
at
us
with
eyes
owlishly
stupid
from
sleep
and
in
a
hoarse
voice
asked
for
vodka
he
recovered
himself
and
after
having
exchanged
salutes
with
bizmyónkoff
went
out
with
him
into
the
next
room
for
consultation
the
conference
of
the
seconds
did
not
last
long
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
they
both
came
to
me
in
my
bedroom
koloberdyáeff
announced
to
me
that
we
shall
fight
at
three
with
pistols
i
silently
bowed
my
head
in
token
of
assent
bizmyónkoff
immediately
took
leave
of
us
and
drove
away
he
was
somewhat
pale
and
inwardly
agitated
like
a
man
who
is
not
accustomed
to
that
sort
of
performance
but
was
very
polite
and
cold
i
seemed
somehow
to
feel
ashamed
in
his
presence
and
i
did
not
dare
to
look
him
in
the
eye
koloberdyáeff
began
to
talk
about
his
horse
again
this
conversation
was
very
much
to
my
taste
i
was
afraid
he
might
mention
liza
but
my
good
captain
was
no
and
more
than
that
he
despised
all
women
calling
them
god
knows
why
salad
at
two
we
lunched
and
at
three
were
already
on
the
field
of
action
in
that
same
where
i
had
once
strolled
with
liza
a
couple
of
paces
from
that
cliff
we
were
the
first
to
arrive
but
the
prince
and
bizmyónkoff
did
not
make
us
wait
long
for
them
the
prince
was
without
exaggeration
as
fresh
as
a
rose
his
brown
eyes
gazed
out
with
extreme
affability
from
beneath
the
visor
of
his
military
cap
he
was
smoking
a
straw
cigar
and
on
catching
sight
of
koloberdyáeff
he
shook
hands
with
him
in
a
cordial
manner
he
even
bowed
very
charmingly
to
me
i
on
the
contrary
felt
conscious
that
i
was
pale
and
my
hands
to
my
intense
vexation
were
trembling
slightly
my
throat
was
dry
never
up
to
that
time
had
i
fought
a
duel
o
god
i
thought
if
only
that
sneering
gentleman
does
not
take
my
agitation
for
timidity
i
inwardly
consigned
my
nerves
to
all
the
fiends
but
on
glancing
at
last
straight
at
the
face
and
catching
on
his
lips
an
almost
imperceptible
smile
i
suddenly
became
inflated
with
wrath
and
immediately
recovered
my
equanimity
in
the
meantime
our
seconds
had
arranged
the
barrier
had
paced
off
the
distance
and
loaded
the
pistols
koloberdyáeff
did
most
of
the
active
part
bizmyónkoff
chiefly
watched
him
it
was
a
magnificent
day
quite
equal
to
the
day
of
the
stroll
the
dense
azure
of
the
sky
again
peeped
through
the
gilded
green
of
the
leaves
their
rustling
seemed
to
excite
me
the
prince
continued
to
smoke
his
cigar
as
he
leaned
his
shoulder
against
the
trunk
of
a
linden
be
so
good
as
to
take
your
places
gentlemen
all
is
ready
said
koloberdyáeff
at
last
handing
us
the
pistols
the
prince
retreated
a
few
paces
halted
and
turning
his
head
back
over
his
shoulder
asked
me
and
do
you
still
refuse
to
withdraw
your
words
i
tried
to
answer
him
but
my
voice
failed
me
and
i
contented
myself
with
a
disdainful
motion
of
the
hand
the
prince
laughed
again
and
took
his
place
we
began
to
approach
each
other
i
raised
my
pistol
and
was
on
the
point
of
taking
aim
at
the
breast
of
my
enemy
at
that
moment
he
really
was
my
enemy
but
suddenly
elevated
the
barrel
as
though
some
one
had
jogged
my
elbow
and
fired
the
prince
staggered
raised
his
left
hand
to
his
left
temple
a
thin
stream
of
blood
trickled
down
his
cheek
from
beneath
his
white
glove
bizmyónkoff
flew
to
him
it
is
nothing
he
said
taking
off
his
cap
which
had
been
perforated
if
it
did
not
enter
my
head
that
means
it
is
only
a
scratch
he
calmly
pulled
a
batiste
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
and
laid
it
on
his
curls
which
were
wet
with
blood
i
looked
at
him
as
though
petrified
and
did
not
stir
from
the
spot
please
go
to
the
barrier
remarked
koloberdyáeff
to
me
with
severity
i
obeyed
shall
the
duel
go
on
he
added
addressing
bizmyónkoff
bizmyónkoff
made
him
no
reply
but
the
prince
without
removing
the
handkerchief
from
the
wound
nor
even
giving
himself
the
satisfaction
of
teasing
me
at
the
barrier
replied
with
a
smile
the
duel
is
ended
and
fired
into
the
air
i
nearly
wept
with
vexation
and
rage
that
man
by
his
magnanimity
had
definitively
trampled
me
in
the
mud
had
cut
my
throat
i
wanted
to
protest
i
wanted
to
demand
that
he
should
fire
at
me
but
he
stepped
up
to
me
and
offering
me
his
hand
everything
is
forgotten
between
us
is
it
not
he
said
in
a
cordial
voice
i
cast
a
glance
at
his
pale
face
at
that
handkerchief
and
utterly
losing
my
head
blushing
with
shame
and
annihilated
i
pressed
his
hand
gentlemen
he
added
addressing
the
seconds
i
hope
that
all
this
will
remain
a
secret
of
course
exclaimed
koloberdyáeff
but
prince
allow
me
and
he
himself
bound
up
his
head
the
prince
as
he
departed
bowed
to
me
once
more
but
bizmyónkoff
did
not
even
bestow
a
glance
on
me
slain
morally
slain
i
returned
home
with
koloberdyáeff
but
what
ails
you
the
captain
asked
me
calm
yourself
the
wound
is
not
dangerous
he
can
dance
if
he
likes
or
are
you
sorry
that
you
did
not
kill
him
in
that
case
you
wrong
he
a
splendid
fellow
why
did
he
spare
me
i
muttered
at
last
oho
so
that
it
calmly
retorted
the
captain
okh
these
romancers
will
be
the
death
of
me
i
positively
refuse
to
describe
my
tortures
in
the
course
of
the
evening
which
followed
this
unlucky
duel
my
pride
suffered
inexpressibly
it
was
not
my
conscience
which
tormented
me
the
consciousness
of
my
stupidity
annihilated
me
i
myself
have
dealt
myself
the
last
the
final
blow
i
kept
repeating
as
i
paced
my
room
with
long
strides
the
prince
wounded
by
me
and
forgiving
me
yes
liza
is
his
now
nothing
can
save
her
now
nor
hold
her
back
on
the
brink
of
perdition
i
was
very
well
aware
that
our
duel
could
not
remain
a
secret
in
spite
of
the
prince
words
in
any
case
it
could
not
remain
a
secret
to
liza
the
prince
is
not
so
stupid
i
whispered
in
a
frenzy
as
not
to
take
advantage
of
and
nevertheless
i
was
mistaken
the
whole
town
heard
about
the
duel
and
its
actual
cause
on
the
very
next
day
of
course
but
it
was
not
the
prince
who
had
babbled
on
the
contrary
when
he
had
presented
himself
to
liza
with
a
bandaged
head
and
an
excuse
which
had
been
prepared
in
advance
she
already
knew
everything
whether
bizmyónkoff
had
betrayed
me
or
whether
the
news
had
reached
her
by
other
roads
i
can
not
say
and
after
all
is
it
possible
to
conceal
anything
in
a
small
town
you
can
imagine
how
liza
took
it
how
the
whole
ozhógin
family
took
it
as
for
me
i
suddenly
became
the
object
of
universal
indignation
of
loathing
a
monster
a
crazily
jealous
man
and
a
cannibal
my
few
acquaintances
renounced
me
as
they
would
have
renounced
a
leper
the
town
authorities
appealed
to
the
prince
with
a
proposition
to
chastise
me
in
a
stern
and
exemplary
manner
only
the
persistent
and
importunate
entreaties
of
the
prince
himself
warded
off
the
calamity
which
menaced
my
head
this
man
was
fated
to
annihilate
me
in
every
way
by
his
magnanimity
he
had
shut
me
up
as
though
with
my
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
ozhógins
house
was
immediately
closed
to
me
kiríla
matvyéevitch
even
returned
to
me
a
plain
pencil
which
i
had
left
at
his
residence
in
reality
he
was
precisely
the
last
man
who
should
have
been
incensed
with
me
my
crazy
jealousy
as
they
called
it
in
the
town
had
defined
elucidated
so
to
speak
the
relations
between
liza
and
the
prince
the
old
ozhógins
themselves
and
the
other
residents
began
to
look
upon
him
almost
in
the
light
of
a
betrothed
husband
in
reality
that
could
not
have
been
quite
agreeable
to
him
but
he
liked
liza
very
much
and
moreover
at
that
time
he
had
not
as
yet
attained
his
object
with
all
the
tact
of
a
clever
man
of
the
world
he
accommodated
himself
to
his
new
position
immediately
entered
into
the
spirit
of
his
new
part
as
the
saying
is
but
i
i
then
gave
up
in
despair
so
far
as
i
myself
was
concerned
and
so
far
as
my
future
was
concerned
when
sufferings
reach
such
a
pitch
that
they
make
our
whole
inward
being
crack
and
creak
like
an
overloaded
cart
they
ought
to
cease
being
ridiculous
but
no
laughter
not
only
accompanies
tears
to
the
end
to
exhaustion
to
the
point
where
it
is
impossible
to
shed
any
more
of
them
not
at
all
it
still
rings
and
resounds
at
a
point
where
the
tongue
grows
dumb
and
lamentation
itself
dies
away
and
then
in
the
first
place
as
i
have
no
intention
of
appearing
absurd
even
to
myself
and
in
the
second
place
as
i
am
frightfully
tired
i
shall
defer
the
continuation
and
god
willing
the
conclusion
of
my
story
until
march
a
light
frost
last
night
there
was
a
thaw
yesterday
i
was
unable
to
go
on
with
my
diary
like
póprishshtchin
i
lay
most
of
the
time
in
bed
and
chatted
with
teréntievna
there
a
woman
for
you
sixty
years
ago
she
lost
her
first
betrothed
from
the
plague
she
has
outlived
all
her
children
she
herself
is
unpardonably
old
she
drinks
tea
to
her
heart
content
she
is
warmly
clad
but
what
do
you
think
she
talked
to
me
about
yesterday
i
had
ordered
that
the
cape
of
an
old
should
be
given
to
another
utterly
denuded
old
woman
for
a
waistcoat
she
wears
a
in
the
shape
of
a
waistcoat
the
cape
was
pretty
thoroughly
eaten
by
moths
so
why
should
not
she
have
it
well
it
strikes
me
that
i
your
nurse
my
dear
little
father
is
a
sin
for
you
to
do
that
and
have
i
been
tending
you
and
so
forth
the
merciless
old
woman
fairly
wore
me
out
with
her
reproaches
but
let
us
return
to
the
story
so
then
i
suffered
like
a
dog
which
has
had
the
hind
part
of
its
body
run
over
by
a
wheel
only
then
only
after
my
expulsion
from
the
ozhógins
house
did
i
become
definitively
aware
how
much
pleasure
a
man
may
derive
from
the
contemplation
of
his
own
unhappiness
oh
men
ye
are
in
reality
a
pitiful
race
well
but
that
is
in
the
nature
of
a
philosophical
remark
i
passed
my
days
in
utter
solitude
and
only
in
the
most
roundabout
and
even
base
ways
was
i
able
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
in
the
ozhógin
family
what
the
prince
was
doing
my
servant
struck
up
an
acquaintance
with
the
of
the
wife
of
his
coachman
this
acquaintance
afforded
me
some
alleviation
and
my
servant
speedily
was
able
from
my
hints
and
gifts
to
divine
what
it
behooved
him
to
talk
about
with
his
master
when
he
was
pulling
off
the
boots
at
night
sometimes
i
chanced
to
meet
in
the
street
some
member
of
the
ozhógin
family
bizmyónkoff
or
the
prince
with
the
prince
and
bizmyónkoff
i
exchanged
bows
but
i
did
not
enter
into
conversation
i
saw
liza
thrice
in
all
once
with
her
mamma
in
a
milliner
shop
once
in
an
open
calash
with
her
father
her
mother
and
the
prince
once
in
church
of
course
i
did
not
venture
to
approach
her
and
only
gazed
at
her
from
afar
in
the
shop
she
was
anxious
but
cheerful
she
was
ordering
something
for
herself
and
busily
trying
on
ribbons
her
mother
was
gazing
at
her
with
hands
clasped
on
her
stomach
her
nose
elevated
and
indulging
in
that
stupid
and
affectionate
smile
which
is
permissible
only
to
fond
mothers
liza
was
in
the
calash
with
the
prince
i
shall
never
forget
that
meeting
the
old
ozhógins
were
sitting
on
the
back
seat
of
the
calash
the
prince
and
liza
in
front
she
was
paler
than
usual
two
pink
streaks
were
barely
discernible
on
her
cheeks
she
was
toward
the
prince
supporting
herself
on
her
outstretched
right
hand
she
was
holding
her
parasol
in
her
left
and
wearily
bending
her
head
she
was
gazing
straight
into
his
face
with
her
expressive
eyes
at
that
moment
she
was
surrendering
herself
utterly
to
him
trusting
him
irrevocably
i
did
not
have
a
chance
to
get
a
good
look
at
his
face
the
calash
dashed
past
too
swiftly
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
also
was
deeply
moved
the
third
time
i
saw
her
was
in
church
not
more
than
ten
days
had
elapsed
since
the
day
when
i
had
encountered
her
in
the
calash
with
the
prince
not
more
than
three
weeks
since
my
duel
the
business
on
account
of
which
the
prince
had
come
to
had
long
been
finished
but
he
still
deferred
his
departure
he
reported
in
petersburg
that
he
was
ill
in
the
city
people
were
expecting
every
day
a
formal
proposal
on
his
part
to
kiríla
matvyéevitch
i
myself
was
only
waiting
for
this
last
blow
in
order
to
retire
forever
the
town
of
had
grown
loathsome
to
me
i
could
not
sit
still
at
home
and
from
morning
till
night
i
dragged
myself
about
the
suburbs
one
grey
wet
day
as
i
was
returning
from
a
stroll
which
had
been
cut
short
by
the
rain
i
stepped
into
the
church
the
evening
service
was
only
just
beginning
there
were
very
few
people
present
i
looked
about
me
and
suddenly
near
a
window
i
descried
a
familiar
profile
at
first
i
did
not
recognise
it
that
pale
face
that
extinct
glance
those
sunken
cheeks
could
it
be
the
same
liza
whom
i
had
seen
two
weeks
before
enveloped
in
a
cloak
with
no
hat
on
her
head
illuminated
from
one
side
by
a
cold
ray
of
light
which
fell
through
the
broad
window
of
white
glass
she
was
staring
immovably
at
the
ikonostásis
and
apparently
making
a
violent
effort
to
pray
striving
to
escape
from
some
sort
of
dejected
rigidity
a
fat
page
with
yellow
on
his
breast
was
standing
behind
her
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
and
staring
with
sleepy
surprise
at
his
mistress
i
shuddered
all
over
i
started
to
go
to
her
but
stopped
short
a
torturing
foreboding
gripped
my
breast
liza
never
stirred
until
the
very
end
of
vespers
all
the
congregation
departed
a
chanter
began
to
sweep
out
the
church
and
still
she
did
not
stir
from
her
place
the
page
approached
her
and
touched
her
gown
she
glanced
round
passed
her
hand
over
her
face
and
went
away
i
escorted
her
at
a
distance
to
her
house
then
returned
home
she
is
ruined
i
exclaimed
as
i
entered
my
room
being
a
man
i
do
not
know
to
this
day
what
was
the
nature
of
my
sensations
then
i
remember
that
folding
my
arms
i
flung
myself
on
the
divan
and
riveted
my
eyes
on
the
floor
but
i
did
not
know
why
only
in
the
midst
of
my
grief
i
seemed
to
be
pleased
at
something
i
would
not
have
admitted
that
on
any
account
if
i
were
not
writing
for
myself
i
really
had
been
tortured
by
painful
terrible
forebodings
and
who
knows
perhaps
i
should
have
been
disconcerted
if
they
had
not
been
fulfilled
such
is
the
human
heart
some
russian
teacher
would
exclaim
at
this
point
in
an
expressive
voice
raising
on
high
his
thick
forefinger
adorned
with
a
carnelian
ring
but
what
care
we
for
the
opinion
of
a
russian
teacher
with
an
expressive
voice
and
a
carnelian
ring
on
his
finger
be
that
as
it
may
my
forebodings
had
turned
out
to
be
correct
the
news
suddenly
spread
through
the
town
that
the
prince
had
taken
his
departure
in
consequence
nominally
of
an
order
from
petersburg
that
he
had
gone
away
without
having
made
any
proposal
of
marriage
either
to
kiríla
matvyéevitch
or
to
his
spouse
and
that
liza
would
continue
to
mourn
his
perfidy
to
the
end
of
her
days
the
prince
departure
had
been
entirely
unexpected
because
as
late
as
the
evening
before
his
coachman
according
to
the
assertions
of
my
servant
had
not
in
the
least
suspected
his
master
intention
this
news
threw
me
into
a
fever
i
immediately
dressed
myself
was
on
the
point
of
running
to
the
ozhógins
but
after
thinking
the
matter
over
i
concluded
that
it
would
be
decorous
to
wait
until
the
following
day
however
i
lost
nothing
by
remaining
at
home
that
evening
there
ran
in
to
see
me
a
certain
pandopipópulo
a
greek
on
his
travels
who
had
accidentally
got
stranded
in
a
gossip
of
the
first
magnitude
who
more
than
any
one
else
had
seethed
with
indignation
against
me
for
my
duel
with
the
prince
he
did
not
even
give
my
servant
time
to
announce
him
but
fairly
forced
his
way
into
my
room
shook
me
vigorously
by
the
hand
made
a
thousand
excuses
for
his
conduct
called
me
a
model
of
magnanimity
and
fearlessness
depicted
the
prince
in
the
blackest
colours
did
not
spare
the
old
ozhógins
whom
fate
had
in
his
opinion
justly
punished
he
gave
a
hit
at
liza
also
in
passing
and
ran
off
after
kissing
me
on
the
shoulder
among
other
things
i
learned
from
him
that
the
prince
vrai
grand
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
had
replied
coldly
to
a
delicate
hint
from
kiríla
matvyéevitch
that
he
had
not
intended
to
deceive
any
one
and
was
not
thinking
of
marrying
had
risen
and
made
his
bow
and
that
was
the
last
they
had
seen
of
him
on
the
following
day
i
betook
myself
to
the
ozhógins
the
footman
at
my
appearance
sprang
from
the
bench
in
the
anteroom
with
swiftness
i
ordered
him
to
announce
me
the
lackey
hastened
off
and
immediately
returned
please
enter
said
he
i
am
ordered
to
invite
you
in
i
entered
kiríla
matvyéevitch
study
until
march
a
frost
so
then
i
entered
kiríla
matvyéevitch
study
i
would
give
a
good
deal
to
any
one
who
could
have
shown
me
my
own
face
at
the
moment
when
that
worthy
official
hastily
wrapping
his
bukhará
round
him
stepped
forward
to
meet
me
with
outstretched
hands
i
must
have
fairly
radiated
an
atmosphere
of
modest
triumph
patronising
sympathy
and
limitless
magnanimity
i
felt
that
i
was
something
in
the
nature
of
scipio
africanus
ozhógin
was
visibly
embarrassed
and
depressed
avoided
my
eye
and
shifted
from
foot
to
foot
where
he
stood
i
also
noticed
that
he
talked
in
an
manner
and
altogether
expressed
himself
very
indefinitely
indefinitely
but
with
fervour
did
he
beg
my
pardon
indefinitely
alluded
to
the
departed
visitor
added
a
few
general
and
indefinite
remarks
about
the
deceitfulness
and
instability
of
earthly
blessings
and
suddenly
becoming
conscious
of
a
tear
in
his
eye
he
hastened
to
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
probably
with
the
object
of
deluding
me
as
to
the
cause
which
was
making
him
weep
he
used
green
russian
snuff
and
every
one
knows
that
that
plant
makes
even
old
men
shed
tears
athwart
which
the
human
eye
peers
forth
dimly
and
senselessly
for
the
space
of
several
minutes
as
a
matter
of
course
i
treated
the
old
man
very
cautiously
inquired
after
the
health
of
his
wife
and
daughter
and
at
once
turned
the
conversation
artfully
on
the
interesting
question
of
rotation
of
crops
i
was
dressed
as
usual
but
the
feeling
of
soft
decorum
and
gentle
condescension
which
filled
my
breast
afforded
me
a
festive
and
fresh
sensation
as
though
i
were
wearing
a
white
waistcoat
and
a
white
neckcloth
one
thing
disturbed
me
the
thought
of
meeting
liza
again
at
last
ozhógin
himself
proposed
to
conduct
me
to
his
wife
that
good
but
stupid
woman
on
beholding
me
at
first
became
frightfully
embarrassed
but
her
brain
was
incapable
of
preserving
one
and
the
same
impression
for
long
together
and
therefore
she
speedily
recovered
her
equanimity
at
last
i
saw
liza
she
entered
the
room
i
had
expected
that
i
should
find
in
her
an
abashed
penitent
sinner
and
had
already
in
advance
imparted
to
my
face
the
most
cordial
and
encouraging
expression
why
should
i
lie
i
really
loved
her
and
thirsted
for
the
happiness
of
forgiving
her
of
putting
out
my
hand
to
her
but
to
my
unspeakable
amazement
in
reply
to
my
significant
bow
she
laughed
coldly
remarked
carelessly
ah
so
it
you
and
immediately
turned
away
from
me
her
laugh
appeared
to
me
forced
it
is
true
and
in
any
case
was
to
her
dreadfully
emaciated
face
but
nevertheless
i
had
not
expected
such
a
reception
i
stared
at
her
in
astonishment
what
a
change
had
taken
place
in
her
between
the
former
child
and
this
woman
there
was
nothing
in
common
she
seemed
to
have
grown
taller
to
have
drawn
herself
up
straighter
all
her
features
especially
her
lips
seemed
to
have
acquired
a
more
defined
outline
her
gaze
had
become
more
profound
more
firm
and
dark
i
sat
with
the
ozhógins
until
dinner
she
rose
left
the
room
and
returned
to
it
calmly
replied
to
questions
and
deliberately
took
no
heed
of
me
i
could
see
that
she
wished
to
make
me
feel
that
i
was
not
worthy
even
of
her
anger
although
i
had
come
near
killing
her
lover
at
last
i
lost
patience
a
malicious
hint
broke
from
my
lips
she
shuddered
darted
a
swift
glance
at
me
rose
and
walking
to
the
window
said
in
a
voice
which
trembled
slightly
you
can
say
anything
you
like
but
you
must
know
that
i
love
that
man
and
shall
always
love
him
and
do
not
consider
him
to
blame
toward
me
in
the
slightest
degree
on
the
contrary
her
voice
broke
with
a
tinkle
she
paused
tried
to
control
herself
but
could
not
and
burst
into
tears
and
left
the
room
the
elder
ozhógins
grew
confused
i
shook
hands
with
both
of
them
sighed
cast
a
glance
upward
and
went
away
i
am
too
weak
there
is
too
little
time
left
to
me
i
am
not
in
a
condition
to
describe
with
my
former
minuteness
this
new
series
of
torturing
meditations
firm
intentions
and
other
fruits
of
the
inward
conflict
which
started
up
in
me
after
the
renewal
of
my
acquaintance
with
the
ozhógins
i
did
not
doubt
that
liza
still
loved
and
would
long
love
the
prince
but
being
a
man
tamed
now
by
circumstances
and
who
had
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
i
did
not
even
dream
of
her
love
i
merely
desired
her
friendship
i
wanted
to
win
her
confidence
her
respect
which
according
to
the
assertions
of
experienced
persons
is
regarded
as
the
most
trustworthy
foundation
for
happiness
in
marriage
unhappily
i
had
lost
sight
of
one
rather
important
circumstance
namely
that
liza
had
hated
me
ever
since
the
day
of
the
duel
i
learned
this
too
late
i
began
to
frequent
the
ozhógins
house
as
of
yore
kiríla
matvyéevitch
was
more
cordial
to
me
and
petted
me
more
than
ever
i
even
have
cause
to
think
that
at
the
time
he
would
have
gladly
given
me
his
daughter
although
i
was
not
an
enviable
match
public
opinion
condemned
him
and
liza
and
on
the
other
hand
extolled
me
to
the
skies
liza
treatment
of
me
did
not
change
she
maintained
silence
most
of
the
time
obeyed
when
she
was
bidden
to
eat
displayed
no
outward
signs
of
grief
but
nevertheless
she
wasted
away
like
a
candle
i
must
do
justice
to
kiríla
matvyéevitch
he
spared
her
in
every
possible
way
old
madame
ozhógin
merely
bristled
up
as
she
looked
at
her
poor
child
there
was
only
one
man
whom
liza
did
not
avoid
although
she
did
not
talk
much
to
him
namely
bizmyónkoff
the
old
ozhógins
treated
him
sternly
even
roughly
they
could
not
pardon
him
for
having
acted
as
second
but
he
continued
to
come
to
their
house
as
though
he
did
not
notice
their
disfavour
with
me
he
was
very
cold
and
strange
to
say
i
felt
afraid
of
him
as
it
were
this
state
of
things
lasted
for
about
a
fortnight
at
last
after
a
sleepless
night
i
made
up
my
mind
to
have
an
explanation
with
liza
to
lay
bare
my
heart
before
her
to
tell
her
that
notwithstanding
the
past
notwithstanding
all
sorts
of
rumours
and
gossip
i
should
regard
myself
as
too
happy
if
she
would
favour
me
with
her
hand
would
restore
to
me
her
trust
i
really
without
jesting
imagined
that
i
was
exhibiting
as
the
compendiums
of
literature
put
it
an
unprecedented
example
of
magnanimity
and
that
she
would
give
her
consent
out
of
sheer
amazement
in
any
case
i
wanted
to
clear
up
the
situation
with
her
and
escape
definitively
from
my
state
of
uncertainty
behind
the
ozhógins
house
lay
a
fairly
spacious
garden
terminating
in
a
linden
coppice
neglected
and
overgrown
in
the
middle
of
this
coppice
rose
an
old
arbour
in
the
chinese
style
a
board
fence
separated
the
garden
from
a
liza
sometimes
strolled
for
hours
at
a
time
alone
in
this
garden
kiríla
matvyéevitch
knew
this
and
had
given
orders
that
she
was
not
to
be
disturbed
and
kept
a
watch
over
her
let
her
grief
wear
itself
out
he
said
when
she
was
not
to
be
found
in
the
house
it
was
only
necessary
to
ring
a
small
bell
on
the
porch
at
and
she
immediately
presented
herself
with
the
same
obdurate
taciturnity
on
her
lips
and
in
her
gaze
and
some
sort
of
crumpled
leaf
in
her
hand
so
one
day
observing
that
she
was
not
in
the
house
i
pretended
that
i
was
making
ready
to
depart
took
leave
of
kiríla
matvyéevitch
put
on
my
hat
and
emerged
from
the
anteroom
into
the
courtyard
and
from
the
courtyard
into
the
street
but
instantly
with
extraordinary
swiftness
slipped
back
through
the
gate
and
made
my
way
past
the
kitchen
into
the
garden
luckily
no
one
espied
me
without
pausing
long
to
think
i
entered
the
grove
with
hasty
steps
before
me
on
the
path
stood
liza
my
heart
began
to
beat
violently
in
my
breast
i
stopped
short
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
was
on
the
point
of
approaching
her
when
all
of
a
sudden
without
turning
round
she
raised
her
hand
and
began
to
listen
from
behind
the
trees
in
the
direction
of
the
two
knocks
rang
out
clearly
as
though
some
one
were
tapping
on
the
fence
liza
clapped
her
hands
a
faint
squeaking
of
the
became
audible
and
bizmyónkoff
emerged
from
the
coppice
i
promptly
hid
myself
behind
a
tree
liza
turned
silently
toward
him
silently
he
drew
her
arm
through
his
and
both
walked
softly
along
the
path
i
stared
after
them
in
astonishment
they
halted
looked
about
them
disappeared
behind
the
bushes
appeared
again
and
finally
entered
the
arbour
this
arbour
was
circular
in
shape
a
tiny
little
building
with
one
door
and
one
small
window
in
the
centre
was
to
be
seen
an
old
table
with
a
single
leg
overgrown
with
fine
green
moss
two
faded
little
plank
divans
stood
at
the
sides
at
some
distance
from
the
damp
and
walls
here
on
unusually
hot
days
and
that
once
a
year
and
in
former
times
they
had
been
in
the
habit
of
drinking
tea
the
door
would
not
shut
at
all
the
frame
had
long
ago
fallen
out
of
the
window
and
catching
by
one
corner
dangled
mournfully
like
the
wounded
wing
of
a
bird
i
stole
up
to
the
arbour
and
cautiously
glanced
through
a
crack
of
the
window
liza
was
sitting
on
one
of
the
little
divans
with
drooping
head
her
right
hand
lay
on
her
lap
bizmyónkoff
was
holding
the
left
in
both
his
hands
he
was
gazing
at
her
with
sympathy
how
do
you
feel
he
asked
her
in
a
low
voice
just
the
same
she
replied
neither
better
nor
emptiness
frightful
emptiness
she
added
dejectedly
raising
her
eyes
bizmyónkoff
made
no
reply
what
think
you
she
went
on
will
he
write
to
me
again
i
think
not
lizavéta
kiríllovna
she
remained
silent
for
a
while
and
in
fact
what
is
there
for
him
to
write
about
he
told
me
everything
in
his
first
letter
i
could
not
be
his
wife
but
i
was
happy
not
for
long
i
was
happy
bizmyónkoff
lowered
his
eyes
akh
she
went
on
with
animation
if
you
only
knew
how
loathsome
that
tchulkatúrin
is
to
me
it
always
seems
to
me
that
i
can
see
his
blood
on
that
man
hands
i
writhed
behind
my
crack
however
she
added
thoughtfully
who
knows
perhaps
had
it
not
been
for
that
duel
akh
when
i
beheld
him
wounded
i
immediately
felt
that
i
was
all
his
tchulkatúrin
loves
you
remarked
bizmyónkoff
what
do
i
care
for
that
do
i
need
any
one
love
she
paused
and
added
slowly
except
yours
yes
my
friend
your
love
is
indispensable
to
me
without
you
i
should
have
perished
you
have
helped
me
to
endure
terrible
moments
she
ceased
bizmyónkoff
began
to
stroke
her
hand
with
paternal
tenderness
there
no
help
for
it
there
no
help
for
it
lizavéta
kiríllovna
he
repeated
several
times
in
succession
yes
and
now
she
said
dully
i
think
i
should
die
if
it
were
not
for
you
you
alone
sustain
me
moreover
you
remind
me
for
you
know
everything
do
you
remember
how
handsome
he
was
that
day
but
forgive
me
it
must
be
painful
for
you
speak
speak
what
do
you
mean
god
bless
you
bizmyónkoff
interrupted
her
she
squeezed
his
hand
you
are
very
kind
bizmyónkoff
she
went
on
you
are
as
kind
as
an
angel
what
am
i
to
do
i
feel
that
i
shall
love
him
until
i
die
i
have
forgiven
him
i
am
grateful
to
him
may
god
grant
him
happiness
may
god
give
him
a
wife
after
his
own
heart
and
her
eyes
filled
with
if
only
he
does
not
forget
me
if
only
he
will
now
and
then
recall
his
liza
to
mind
let
us
go
out
she
added
after
a
brief
pause
bizmyónkoff
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
i
know
she
began
with
warmth
every
one
is
blaming
me
every
one
is
casting
stones
at
me
now
let
them
all
the
same
i
would
not
exchange
my
unhappiness
for
their
happiness
no
no
he
did
not
love
me
long
but
he
did
love
me
he
never
deceived
me
he
did
not
tell
me
that
i
was
to
be
his
wife
i
myself
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
only
poor
papa
hoped
for
that
and
now
i
am
still
not
utterly
unhappy
there
remains
to
me
the
memory
and
however
terrible
the
consequences
may
be
i
am
stifling
here
it
was
here
that
i
saw
him
for
the
last
time
let
us
go
out
into
the
air
they
rose
i
barely
managed
to
leap
aside
and
hide
behind
a
thick
linden
they
came
out
of
the
arbour
and
so
far
as
i
was
able
to
judge
from
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
went
off
into
the
grove
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
had
been
standing
there
without
stirring
from
the
spot
absorbed
in
a
sort
of
irrational
surprise
when
suddenly
the
sound
of
footsteps
became
audible
again
i
started
and
peered
cautiously
from
my
ambush
bizmyónkoff
and
liza
were
returning
by
the
same
path
both
were
greatly
agitated
especially
bizmyónkoff
he
had
been
weeping
apparently
liza
halted
gazed
at
him
and
uttered
the
following
words
distinctly
i
consent
bizmyónkoff
i
would
not
have
consented
had
you
merely
wished
to
save
me
to
extricate
me
from
a
frightful
position
but
you
love
me
you
know
all
and
you
love
me
i
shall
never
find
a
more
trustworthy
faithful
friend
i
will
be
your
wife
bizmyónkoff
kissed
her
hand
she
smiled
sadly
at
him
and
went
to
the
house
bizmyónkoff
dashed
into
the
thicket
and
i
went
my
way
as
bizmyónkoff
had
probably
said
to
liza
precisely
what
i
had
intended
to
say
to
her
and
as
she
had
given
him
precisely
the
answer
which
i
had
hoped
to
hear
from
her
there
was
no
necessity
for
my
troubling
myself
further
a
fortnight
later
she
married
him
the
old
ozhógins
were
glad
to
get
any
bridegroom
well
tell
me
now
am
not
i
a
superfluous
man
did
not
i
play
in
the
whole
of
that
affair
the
part
of
a
superfluous
man
the
rôle
of
the
prince
as
to
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
the
rôle
of
bizmyónkoff
also
is
comprehensible
but
i
why
was
i
mixed
up
in
it
what
a
stupid
fifth
wheel
to
the
cart
i
was
akh
is
bitter
bitter
so
now
as
the
stevedores
on
the
volga
say
one
more
little
day
then
another
and
nothing
will
be
either
bitter
or
sweet
to
me
any
more
march
things
are
bad
i
write
these
lines
in
bed
the
weather
has
changed
suddenly
since
yesterday
is
hot
almost
a
summer
day
everything
is
thawing
crumbling
and
streaming
there
is
an
odour
of
ploughed
earth
in
the
air
a
heavy
powerful
oppressive
odour
the
steam
is
rising
everywhere
the
sun
is
fairly
beating
fairly
blazing
down
i
am
in
a
bad
way
i
feel
that
i
am
decomposing
i
started
out
to
write
a
diary
and
instead
of
that
what
have
i
done
i
have
narrated
one
incident
out
of
my
own
life
i
have
been
babbling
sleeping
memories
have
waked
up
and
carried
me
away
i
have
written
leisurely
in
detail
as
though
i
still
had
years
before
me
and
now
lo
there
is
no
time
to
continue
death
death
is
advancing
i
can
already
hear
its
menacing
crescendo
time
up
time
up
and
where
the
harm
does
it
make
any
difference
what
i
have
told
in
the
presence
of
death
all
the
last
earthly
vanities
disappear
i
feel
that
i
am
quieting
down
i
am
becoming
more
simple
more
clear
i
have
acquired
sense
but
too
late
is
strange
i
am
growing
still
is
true
and
nevertheless
i
am
overcome
with
dread
yes
i
am
overcome
with
dread
over
the
voiceless
yawning
gulf
i
shudder
i
turn
aside
with
eager
attention
i
gaze
about
in
all
directions
every
object
is
doubly
dear
to
me
i
can
not
gaze
my
fill
at
my
poor
cheerless
room
as
i
bid
farewell
to
every
tiny
fleck
on
my
walls
sate
yourselves
for
the
last
time
ye
eyes
of
mine
life
is
withdrawing
it
is
flowing
evenly
and
softly
away
from
me
like
the
shore
from
the
glances
of
the
traveller
by
sea
the
aged
yellow
face
of
my
nurse
bound
up
in
a
dark
kerchief
the
hissing
samovár
on
the
table
the
pot
of
geranium
in
front
of
the
window
and
thou
my
poor
dog
trésor
the
pen
wherewith
i
indite
these
lines
my
own
hand
i
see
you
now
there
you
are
there
is
it
possible
perhaps
i
shall
see
you
no
more
is
painful
for
a
living
being
to
part
with
life
why
dost
thou
fawn
on
me
poor
dog
why
dost
thou
lean
thy
breast
against
my
bed
convulsively
tucking
under
thy
short
tail
and
never
taking
from
me
thy
kind
sad
eyes
art
thou
sorry
for
me
dost
thou
already
feel
instinctively
that
thy
master
will
soon
be
no
more
akh
if
i
could
also
pass
in
review
mentally
all
the
objects
in
my
room
i
know
that
these
memories
are
cheerless
and
insignificant
but
i
have
no
others
emptiness
frightful
emptiness
as
liza
said
oh
my
god
my
god
here
i
am
dying
my
heart
capable
of
love
and
ready
to
love
will
soon
cease
to
beat
and
can
it
be
that
it
will
be
silenced
forever
without
having
even
once
tasted
of
happiness
without
having
a
single
time
swelled
beneath
the
sweet
burden
of
joy
alas
is
impossible
impossible
i
know
if
at
least
now
before
my
death
and
death
nevertheless
is
a
sacred
thing
for
it
elevates
every
being
if
some
charming
sad
friendly
voice
were
to
sing
over
me
the
parting
song
of
my
own
woe
perhaps
i
might
become
reconciled
to
it
but
to
die
is
stupid
stupid
i
believe
i
am
beginning
to
rave
farewell
life
farewell
my
garden
and
you
my
lindens
when
summer
comes
see
that
you
do
not
forget
to
cover
yourselves
with
flowers
from
top
to
bottom
and
may
good
people
lie
in
your
fragrant
shade
on
the
cool
grass
beneath
the
lisping
murmur
of
your
leaves
lightly
agitated
by
the
breeze
farewell
farewell
farewell
everything
and
forever
farewell
liza
i
have
written
these
two
words
and
have
almost
laughed
that
exclamation
seems
bookish
i
seem
to
be
composing
a
sentimental
novel
and
ending
up
a
despairing
letter
is
the
first
of
april
can
it
be
that
i
shall
die
that
would
be
rather
indecorous
even
however
it
befits
me
how
the
doctor
did
gabble
april
is
over
life
is
ended
i
really
shall
die
it
is
hot
out
of
doors
almost
stifling
or
is
it
that
my
chest
is
already
refusing
to
breathe
my
little
comedy
has
been
played
through
the
curtain
is
falling
in
becoming
annihilated
i
shall
cease
to
be
superfluous
akh
how
brilliant
that
sun
is
those
powerful
rays
exhale
eternity
farewell
teréntievna
this
morning
as
she
sat
by
the
window
she
fell
to
weeping
perhaps
over
me
and
perhaps
because
she
herself
must
die
before
long
also
i
made
her
promise
not
to
hurt
trésor
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
write
i
drop
my
pen
is
time
death
is
already
drawing
near
with
increasing
rumble
like
a
carriage
by
night
on
the
pavement
it
is
here
it
is
hovering
around
me
like
that
faint
breath
which
made
the
hair
of
the
prophet
stand
upright
on
his
head
i
am
dying
live
on
ye
living
and
may
the
young
life
play
at
the
entrance
of
the
grave
and
nature
the
indifferent
with
beauty

the

this
last

is
the
profile
of
a

under
the

as
the
chirography
of

does
not
in
the
least
agree
with
the
chirography
in
which
the

of

the

in

that

three
portraits
the
neighbours
constitute
one
of
the
most
serious
drawbacks
to
country
life
i
knew
one
landed
proprietor
of
the
government
of
vólogda
who
at
every
convenient
opportunity
was
wont
to
repeat
the
following
words
thank
god
i
have
no
neighbours
and
i
must
admit
that
i
could
not
refrain
from
envying
that
lucky
mortal
my
little
village
is
situated
in
one
of
the
most
governments
of
russia
i
am
surrounded
by
a
vast
multitude
of
petty
neighbours
beginning
with
the
and
respected
landed
proprietors
clad
in
capacious
and
more
capacious
waistcoats
and
ending
with
arrant
roysterers
who
wear
with
long
sleeves
and
the
fimsky
knot
on
the
back
in
the
ranks
of
these
nobles
however
i
have
accidentally
discovered
one
very
amiable
young
fellow
once
upon
a
time
he
was
in
the
military
service
then
he
retired
and
settled
down
for
good
and
all
in
the
country
according
to
his
account
he
served
two
years
in
the
regiment
but
i
positively
can
not
understand
how
that
man
could
have
discharged
any
duties
whatsoever
not
only
for
the
space
of
two
years
but
even
for
the
space
of
two
days
he
was
born
for
a
peaceful
life
for
rustic
tranquillity
that
is
to
say
for
indolent
careless
vegetation
which
i
may
remark
in
parenthesis
is
not
devoid
of
great
and
inexhaustible
charms
he
enjoyed
a
very
respectable
property
without
troubling
himself
too
much
about
the
management
of
his
estate
he
spent
about
ten
thousand
rubles
a
year
procured
for
himself
a
capital
cook
my
friend
was
fond
of
good
eating
he
also
imported
from
moscow
the
newest
french
books
and
journals
he
read
nothing
in
russian
except
the
reports
of
his
overseer
and
that
with
great
difficulty
from
morning
until
dinner
if
he
did
not
go
off
hunting
he
did
not
doff
his
he
sorted
over
some
sketches
or
other
pertaining
to
the
management
or
betook
himself
to
the
stable
or
to
the
and
indulged
in
a
good
laugh
with
the
peasant
wives
who
rattled
their
chains
as
the
saying
is
in
his
presence
out
of
ostentation
after
dinner
my
friend
dressed
himself
before
the
mirror
with
great
care
and
drove
off
to
some
neighbour
endowed
with
two
or
three
pretty
young
daughters
heedlessly
and
pacifically
he
dangled
after
one
of
them
played
at
buff
with
them
returned
home
rather
late
and
immediately
sank
into
heroic
slumber
he
could
not
feel
bored
because
he
never
devoted
himself
to
absolute
inaction
and
he
was
not
fastidious
as
to
his
choice
of
occupations
and
like
a
child
was
amused
with
the
smallest
trifle
on
the
other
hand
he
felt
no
special
attachment
to
life
and
it
sometimes
happened
that
when
it
became
necessary
to
outrun
a
wolf
or
a
fox
he
would
launch
his
horse
at
full
speed
over
such
ravines
that
to
this
day
i
can
not
understand
why
he
did
not
break
his
neck
a
hundred
times
he
belonged
to
the
category
of
people
who
evoke
in
you
the
thought
that
they
are
not
aware
of
their
own
value
that
beneath
their
external
generosity
great
and
mighty
passions
are
concealed
but
he
would
have
laughed
in
your
face
if
he
could
have
guessed
that
you
cherished
such
an
opinion
concerning
him
yes
and
i
am
bound
to
admit
i
think
myself
that
if
my
friend
was
haunted
in
his
youth
by
any
aspiration
indistinct
but
powerful
toward
what
is
very
prettily
called
something
higher
that
aspiration
had
long
long
ago
calmed
down
in
him
and
pined
away
he
was
rather
obese
and
enjoyed
splendid
health
in
our
age
it
is
impossible
not
to
like
people
who
give
little
thought
to
themselves
because
they
are
extremely
rare
and
my
friend
almost
completely
forgot
his
own
person
however
i
have
already
said
too
much
about
him
i
think
and
my
chattering
is
all
the
more
since
he
does
not
serve
as
the
subject
of
my
story
his
name
was
piótr
feódorovitch
lutchínoff
one
autumn
day
five
of
us
sportsmen
had
assembled
together
at
piótr
feódorovitch
we
had
spent
the
entire
morning
in
the
fields
had
coursed
two
wolves
and
a
multitude
of
hares
and
had
returned
home
in
the
frame
of
mind
which
invades
every
man
after
a
successful
hunt
twilight
was
descending
the
wind
was
playing
over
the
dark
fields
and
noisily
rocking
the
naked
crests
of
the
birches
and
lindens
which
surrounded
lutchínoff
house
we
arrived
and
alighted
from
our
horses
on
the
porch
i
halted
and
glanced
about
me
long
were
crawling
heavily
across
the
grey
sky
a
bush
was
writhing
in
the
wind
and
creaking
piteously
the
yellow
grass
bent
feebly
and
sadly
to
the
ground
flocks
of
blackbirds
were
flying
to
and
fro
among
the
trees
dotted
with
clusters
of
berries
in
the
slender
and
brittle
branches
of
the
tomtits
were
hopping
and
whistling
the
dogs
were
barking
hoarsely
in
the
village
melancholy
overpowered
me
for
which
reason
i
entered
the
with
genuine
pleasure
the
shutters
were
closed
on
the
round
table
covered
with
a
cloth
of
dazzling
whiteness
in
the
midst
of
crystal
caraffes
filled
with
red
wine
burned
eight
candles
in
silver
candlesticks
a
fire
blazed
merrily
on
the
hearth
and
an
old
very
comely
butler
with
a
huge
bald
spot
dressed
in
english
fashion
stood
in
respectful
immobility
in
front
of
another
table
which
was
already
adorned
with
a
large
encircled
with
a
light
fragrant
steam
in
the
anteroom
we
had
passed
another
respectable
man
engaged
in
cooling
the
champagne
according
to
the
strict
rules
of
the
art
the
dinner
was
as
is
usual
on
such
occasions
extremely
agreeable
we
laughed
recounted
the
incidents
which
had
occurred
during
the
hunt
and
recalled
with
rapture
two
notable
drives
after
having
dined
rather
heartily
we
disposed
ourselves
in
broad
in
front
of
the
fireplace
a
capacious
silver
bowl
made
its
appearance
on
the
table
and
a
few
moments
later
the
flitting
flame
of
rum
announced
to
us
our
host
pleasant
intention
to
brew
a
punch
piótr
feódorovitch
was
a
man
not
lacking
in
taste
he
knew
for
example
that
nothing
has
such
deadly
effect
on
the
fancy
as
the
even
cold
and
pedantic
light
of
lamps
therefore
he
ordered
that
only
two
candles
should
be
left
in
the
room
strange
quivered
on
the
walls
produced
by
the
fitful
play
of
the
fire
on
the
hearth
and
the
flame
of
the
punch
a
quiet
extremely
agreeable
comfort
replaced
in
our
hearts
the
somewhat
obstreperous
jollity
which
had
reigned
at
dinner
conversations
have
their
fates
like
books
according
to
the
latin
apothegm
like
everything
in
the
world
our
conversation
on
that
evening
was
peculiarly
varied
and
vivacious
in
part
it
rose
to
decidedly
important
general
questions
then
lightly
and
unconstrainedly
returned
to
the
commonplaces
of
everyday
life
after
chatting
a
good
deal
we
all
suddenly
fell
silent
at
such
times
they
say
the
angel
of
silence
flits
past
i
do
not
know
why
my
companions
ceased
talking
but
i
stopped
because
my
eyes
had
suddenly
paused
on
three
dusty
portraits
in
black
wooden
frames
the
colours
had
been
rubbed
off
and
here
and
there
the
canvas
was
warped
but
the
faces
could
still
be
distinguished
the
middle
portrait
represented
a
woman
young
in
years
in
a
white
gown
with
lace
borders
and
a
tall
coiffure
of
the
eighties
on
her
right
against
a
perfectly
black
background
was
visible
the
round
fat
face
of
a
russian
landed
proprietor
years
of
age
with
a
low
broad
forehead
a
stubby
nose
and
an
ingenuous
smile
the
powdered
french
coiffure
was
extremely
out
of
keeping
with
the
expression
of
his
slavonic
countenance
the
artist
had
depicted
him
in
a
kaftan
of
crimson
hue
with
large
strass
buttons
in
his
hand
he
held
some
sort
of
unusual
flower
the
third
portrait
painted
by
another
and
more
experienced
hand
represented
a
man
of
thirty
in
a
green
uniform
of
the
period
of
katherine
ii
with
red
facings
a
white
and
a
thin
batiste
neckerchief
with
one
hand
he
leaned
on
a
cane
with
a
gold
head
the
other
he
had
thrust
into
his
waistcoat
his
thin
swarthy
face
breathed
forth
insolent
arrogance
his
long
slender
eyebrows
almost
met
over
his
eyes
on
his
pale
lips
played
an
evil
smile
what
makes
you
stare
at
those
faces
piótr
feódorovitch
asked
me
because
i
answered
looking
at
him
would
you
like
to
hear
the
whole
story
about
those
three
persons
pray
do
us
the
favour
to
tell
it
we
replied
with
one
voice
piótr
feódorovitch
rose
took
a
candle
raised
it
to
the
portraits
and
in
the
voice
of
a
man
who
is
exhibiting
wild
animals
gentlemen
he
proclaimed
this
lady
is
the
adopted
daughter
of
my
own
olga
ivánovna
called
lutchínoff
who
died
unmarried
forty
years
ago
this
gentleman
pointing
to
the
portrait
of
the
man
in
uniform
is
sergeant
of
the
guards
vasíly
ivánovitch
lutchínoff
who
departed
this
life
by
the
will
of
god
in
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
ninety
and
this
gentleman
to
whom
i
have
not
the
honour
to
be
related
is
a
certain
pável
afanásievitch
rogatchyóff
who
never
served
anywhere
so
far
as
i
am
aware
please
to
note
the
hole
which
is
in
his
breast
in
the
exact
place
of
the
heart
this
hole
which
is
as
you
see
regular
and
probably
could
not
have
happened
accidentally
now
he
went
on
in
his
ordinary
voice
please
to
take
your
seats
arm
yourselves
with
patience
and
listen
gentlemen
he
began
i
descend
from
a
fairly
ancient
race
i
am
not
proud
of
my
descent
because
my
ancestors
were
all
frightful
spendthrifts
this
reproach
however
does
not
apply
to
my
iván
andréevitch
lutchínoff
on
the
contrary
he
bore
the
reputation
of
being
an
extraordinarily
penurious
and
even
miserly
man
during
the
last
years
of
his
life
at
all
events
he
passed
his
youth
in
petersburg
and
was
a
witness
of
elizavéta
reign
in
petersburg
he
married
and
had
by
his
wife
who
was
also
my
four
children
three
sons
vasíly
iván
and
pável
my
grandfather
and
one
daughter
natálya
in
addition
to
these
iván
andréevitch
took
into
his
family
the
daughter
of
a
distant
relative
a
full
and
nameless
orphan
olga
ivánovna
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
my
subjects
were
probably
aware
of
his
existence
because
they
were
in
the
habit
of
sending
to
him
when
no
particular
catastrophe
had
happened
a
very
considerable
sum
in
but
they
had
never
beheld
his
face
the
village
of
lutchínovko
deprived
of
the
light
of
its
master
countenance
was
thriving
when
all
of
a
sudden
one
fine
morning
a
heavy
travelling
carriage
drove
into
the
village
and
drew
up
in
front
of
the
cottage
the
peasants
startled
by
such
an
unprecedented
event
flocked
thither
and
beheld
their
master
mistress
and
all
the
pair
offspring
with
the
exception
of
the
eldest
vasíly
who
had
remained
in
petersburg
from
that
memorable
day
forth
and
to
the
very
day
of
his
death
iván
andréevitch
never
quitted
lutchínovko
he
built
himself
a
house
this
very
house
in
which
i
now
have
the
pleasure
of
chatting
with
you
he
also
built
the
church
and
began
to
live
the
life
of
a
landed
proprietor
iván
andréevitch
was
a
man
of
huge
stature
gaunt
taciturn
and
extremely
slow
in
all
his
movements
he
never
wore
a
and
no
one
with
the
exception
of
his
valet
had
ever
seen
him
with
unpowdered
hair
iván
andréevitch
habitually
walked
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
slowly
turning
his
head
at
every
step
every
day
he
walked
in
the
long
linden
alley
which
he
had
planted
with
his
own
hands
and
before
his
death
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
enjoying
the
shade
of
those
lindens
iván
andréevitch
was
extremely
parsimonious
of
his
words
this
remarkable
circumstance
may
serve
as
a
proof
of
his
taciturnity
that
in
the
space
of
twenty
years
he
never
said
a
single
word
to
his
spouse
anna
pávlovna
altogether
his
relations
to
anna
pávlovna
were
of
a
very
strange
she
administered
all
the
domestic
affairs
at
dinner
she
always
sat
by
her
husband
side
he
would
ruthlessly
have
chastised
any
man
who
presumed
to
utter
one
disrespectful
word
to
her
and
yet
he
himself
never
spoke
to
her
and
never
touched
her
hand
anna
pávlovna
was
a
pale
timid
crushed
woman
every
day
she
prayed
in
church
on
her
knees
and
never
smiled
it
was
said
that
formerly
that
is
to
say
before
their
arrival
in
the
country
they
had
lived
in
grand
style
it
was
said
also
that
anna
pávlovna
had
broken
her
marital
vows
that
her
husband
had
found
out
about
her
fault
however
that
may
have
been
iván
andréevitch
even
when
he
lay
dying
did
not
become
reconciled
to
her
she
never
left
him
during
his
last
illness
but
he
seemed
not
to
notice
her
one
night
anna
pávlovna
was
sitting
in
iván
andréevitch
bedroom
he
was
tortured
with
insomnia
the
was
burning
in
front
of
the
holy
picture
my
servant
yúditch
concerning
whom
i
shall
have
a
couple
of
words
to
say
to
you
hereafter
had
left
the
room
anna
pávlovna
rose
crossed
the
chamber
and
flung
herself
sobbing
on
her
knees
before
her
husband
bed
tried
to
say
something
and
stretched
out
her
arms
iván
andréevitch
looked
at
her
and
shouted
in
a
weak
but
firm
voice
man
the
servant
entered
anna
pávlovna
hastily
rose
to
her
feet
and
returned
reeling
to
her
place
iván
andréevitch
children
were
extremely
afraid
of
him
they
grew
up
in
the
country
and
were
witnesses
of
iván
andréevitch
strange
behaviour
to
his
wife
they
all
passionately
loved
anna
pávlovna
but
dared
not
express
their
love
she
herself
seemed
to
shun
them
you
remember
my
grandfather
gentlemen
to
the
day
of
his
death
he
always
used
to
go
about
on
tiptoe
and
he
spoke
in
a
whisper
that
what
habit
will
do
my
grandfather
and
his
brother
iván
ivánovitch
were
plain
kind
peaceable
and
melancholy
people
my
natálya
married
a
coarse
stupid
man
as
you
know
and
until
her
death
cherished
for
him
a
dumb
servile
love
but
their
brother
vasíly
was
not
like
that
i
think
i
have
told
you
that
iván
andréevitch
left
him
in
petersburg
he
was
twenty
years
old
at
the
time
his
father
confided
him
to
the
care
of
a
distant
relative
a
man
no
longer
young
a
bachelor
and
a
frightful
voltairian
vasíly
grew
up
and
entered
the
service
he
was
small
of
stature
but
well
built
and
extremely
agile
he
spoke
french
splendidly
and
was
renowned
for
his
skill
at
fighting
with
the
broadsword
he
was
considered
one
of
the
most
brilliant
young
men
of
the
beginning
of
katherine
ii
reign
my
father
often
told
me
that
he
knew
more
than
one
old
woman
who
could
not
mention
vasíly
ivánovitch
lutchínoff
without
heartfelt
emotion
picture
to
yourself
a
man
gifted
with
remarkable
strength
of
will
passionate
and
calculating
patient
and
daring
secretive
to
the
last
degree
and
according
to
the
words
of
all
his
contemporaries
bewitchingly
enchantingly
amiable
he
had
neither
conscience
nor
nor
honour
although
no
one
could
call
him
a
positively
bad
man
he
was
selfish
but
knew
how
to
conceal
his
selfishness
and
was
passionately
fond
of
independence
when
vasíly
ivánovitch
used
smilingly
to
screw
up
his
black
eyes
when
he
wanted
to
fascinate
any
one
they
say
that
it
was
impossible
to
resist
him
and
even
people
who
were
convinced
of
the
coldness
and
hardness
of
his
spirit
more
than
once
surrendered
to
the
bewitching
power
of
his
influence
he
zealously
served
himself
and
made
others
toil
also
for
his
benefit
and
always
succeeded
in
everything
because
he
never
lost
his
head
did
not
disdain
flattery
as
a
means
and
understood
how
to
flatter
ten
years
after
iván
andréevitch
settled
in
the
country
he
came
to
lutchínovko
as
a
brilliant
officer
of
the
guards
for
four
months
and
in
that
space
of
time
succeeded
in
turning
the
head
even
of
the
surly
old
man
his
father
it
is
strange
iván
andréevitch
listened
with
delight
to
his
son
tales
of
his
conquests
his
brothers
were
dumb
in
his
presence
and
admired
him
as
a
superior
being
and
even
anna
pávlovna
herself
came
to
love
him
almost
more
than
all
her
other
children
who
were
so
sincerely
devoted
to
her
vasíly
ivánovitch
came
to
the
country
in
the
first
place
in
order
to
see
his
relatives
but
in
the
second
place
also
in
order
to
get
as
much
money
as
possible
out
of
his
father
he
had
lived
sumptuously
and
kept
open
house
in
petersburg
and
had
contracted
a
multitude
of
debts
it
was
not
easy
for
him
to
reconcile
himself
to
his
parent
stinginess
and
although
iván
andréevitch
gave
him
for
his
trip
alone
more
money
in
all
probability
than
he
gave
all
his
other
children
in
the
space
of
the
twenty
years
which
they
spent
in
the
paternal
house
yet
vasíly
stuck
to
the
familiar
russian
rule
take
all
you
can
get
iván
andréevitch
had
a
servant
yúditch
by
name
as
tall
gaunt
and
taciturn
a
man
as
his
master
they
say
that
this
yúditch
was
in
part
the
cause
of
the
strange
behaviour
of
iván
andréevitch
to
anna
pávlovna
they
say
that
it
was
he
who
discovered
the
guilty
liaison
of
my
with
one
of
my
best
friends
probably
yúditch
deeply
repented
of
his
zeal
because
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
more
man
his
memory
is
held
sacred
to
this
day
by
all
my
yúditch
enjoyed
the
unbounded
confidence
of
my
at
that
period
landed
proprietors
had
money
but
did
not
hand
it
over
to
loan
institutions
for
but
kept
it
themselves
in
coffers
in
cellars
and
the
like
iván
andréevitch
kept
all
his
money
in
a
huge
coffer
which
stood
under
the
head
of
his
bed
the
key
to
this
coffer
was
handed
over
to
yúditch
every
evening
when
he
went
to
bed
iván
andréevitch
ordered
this
chest
to
be
opened
in
his
presence
tapped
all
the
sacks
in
turn
with
his
cane
and
on
saturdays
he
and
yúditch
untied
the
sacks
and
carefully
counted
over
the
money
vasíly
found
out
about
all
these
performances
and
was
fired
with
a
desire
to
rummage
a
bit
in
the
sacred
coffer
in
the
course
of
five
or
six
days
he
yúditch
that
is
to
say
he
reduced
the
poor
old
fellow
to
such
a
state
that
as
the
saying
is
he
fairly
worshipped
his
young
master
after
having
properly
prepared
him
vasíly
assumed
a
careworn
and
gloomy
aspect
for
a
long
time
refused
to
answer
inquiries
and
at
last
told
him
that
he
had
gambled
away
all
his
money
and
intended
to
lay
violent
hands
on
himself
if
he
did
not
obtain
money
from
somewhere
yúditch
began
to
sob
flung
himself
on
his
knees
before
him
begged
him
to
remember
god
not
to
ruin
his
soul
vasíly
without
uttering
a
word
locked
himself
up
in
his
chamber
after
a
while
he
heard
some
one
knocking
cautiously
on
his
door
he
opened
the
door
and
beheld
on
the
threshold
yúditch
pale
and
trembling
with
a
key
in
his
hands
vasíly
immediately
understood
everything
at
first
he
resisted
for
a
long
time
yúditch
kept
repeating
with
tears
pray
master
take
it
at
last
vasíly
consented
this
happened
on
monday
the
idea
occurred
to
vasíly
to
replace
the
money
he
abstracted
with
bits
of
glass
he
reckoned
on
iván
andréevitch
not
paying
any
special
heed
to
the
barely
perceptible
difference
in
the
sound
when
he
tapped
the
sacks
with
his
cane
and
by
saturday
he
hoped
to
obtain
money
and
replace
it
in
the
sacks
no
sooner
thought
than
done
his
father
in
fact
did
not
notice
anything
but
vasíly
did
not
obtain
money
by
saturday
he
had
hoped
with
the
money
he
had
taken
to
clean
out
at
the
a
certain
wealthy
neighbour
and
on
the
contrary
he
lost
everything
himself
in
the
meantime
saturday
arrived
the
turn
came
for
the
sacks
stuffed
with
bits
of
glass
picture
to
yourselves
gentlemen
the
amazement
of
iván
andréevitch
what
the
meaning
of
this
he
thundered
yúditch
made
no
reply

stolen
this
money

then
has
some
one
taken
the
key
from
thee
i
have

of
glass

for
the
last
time

yúditch
hung
his
head
and
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
back
hey

shouted
iván
andréevitch
in
a
raging
the
rods
what

whispered
yúditch

a
thief

yúditch

expected

rascality
from

service
iván
andréevitch
said
yúditch
with
an
effort
and
what
care
i
about
thy
grey
hair
may
the
devil
take
thee
and
thy
service
the
people
entered
take
him
and
give
him
a
good
flogging
iván
andréevitch
lips
were
pale
and
trembling
he
ramped
about
the
room
like
a
wild
beast
in
a
confined
cage
the
men
did
not
dare
to
execute
his
commands
what

thundered
the
maddened
old
man
the
torture
began
suddenly
the
door
flew
open
and
vasíly
entered
he
was
almost
paler
than
his
father
his
hands
trembled
his
upper
lip
was
raised
and
disclosed
a
row
of
white
even
teeth
i
am
guilty
he
said
in
a
dull
but
steady
i
took
the
money
the
men
stopped
short
thou

váska
without
the
consent
of
yúditch

said
yúditch
with
my
consent
i
myself
gave
the
key
to
vasíly
ivánovitch

shouted
iván
thanks
vasíly
thanks

i
shall
not
spare
thee
yúditch
all
the
same
why

you
stopped
or
do
you
no
longer

my
authority
and
i
settle
with
you
my
dear
little
dove
he
added
turning
to
vasíly
the
men
were
on
the
point
of
setting
to
work
again
on
yúditch
do
touch
him
whispered
vasíly
through
his
teeth
the
servants
did
not
heed
back
he
shouted
and
hurled
himself
upon
them
they
staggered
back
ah
a
rebel
moaned
iván
andréevitch
and
raising
his
cane
he
advanced
on
his
son
vasíly
leaped
aside
grasped
the
hilt
of
his
sword
and
bared
it
all
began
to
tremble
anna
pávlovna
attracted
by
the
noise
frightened
and
pale
made
her
appearance
in
the
doorway
iván
andréevitch
face
underwent
a
frightful
change
he
staggered
dropped
his
cane
and
fell
heavily
into
an
covering
his
face
with
both
hands
no
one
stirred
all
stood
as
though
rooted
to
the
spot
not
excepting
even
vasíly
he
convulsively
gripped
the
steel
hilt
of
his
sword
his
eyes
flashed
with
a
morose
evil
gleam
go
away
all
begone
said
iván
andréevitch
in
a
low
voice
without
removing
his
hands
from
his
face
the
whole
throng
withdrew
vasíly
halted
on
the
threshold
then
suddenly
tossed
his
head
embraced
yúditch
kissed
his
mother
hand
and
two
hours
later
he
was
no
longer
in
the
village
he
had
departed
for
petersburg
on
the
evening
of
that
day
yúditch
was
sitting
on
the
porch
of
the
cottage
the
servants
swarmed
around
him
pitied
him
and
bitterly
blamed
the
master
stop
my
lads
he
said
to
them
at
last
enough
of
that
why
do
you
abuse
him
i
do
believe
that
he
our
dear
little
father
is
pleased
himself
with
his
desperate
deed
as
a
result
of
this
affair
vasíly
never
saw
his
parents
again
iván
andréevitch
died
without
him
probably
with
such
grief
at
his
heart
as
may
god
spare
any
of
us
from
experiencing
in
the
meantime
vasíly
ivánovitch
went
out
in
society
made
merry
after
his
own
fashion
and
squandered
money
how
he
obtained
the
money
i
can
not
say
with
certainty
he
procured
for
himself
a
french
servant
a
clever
and
intelligent
young
fellow
a
certain
boursier
this
man
became
passionately
attached
to
him
and
aided
him
in
all
his
numerous
performances
i
have
no
intention
of
narrating
to
you
in
detail
all
the
pranks
of
my
he
distinguished
himself
by
such
unbounded
audacity
such
snaky
tact
such
incredible
such
adroit
and
subtle
wit
that
i
must
confess
i
can
understand
the
limitless
power
of
that
unprincipled
man
over
the
most
noble
souls
soon
after
his
father
death
vasíly
ivánovitch
notwithstanding
all
his
tact
was
challenged
to
a
duel
by
an
outraged
husband
he
fought
severely
wounded
his
antagonist
and
was
forced
to
quit
the
capital
he
was
ordered
to
reside
permanently
on
his
hereditary
estate
vasíly
ivánovitch
was
thirty
years
of
age
you
can
easily
imagine
gentlemen
with
what
feelings
this
man
who
had
become
accustomed
to
the
brilliant
life
of
the
capital
journeyed
to
his
native
place
they
say
that
on
the
road
he
frequently
got
out
of
his
kibítka
flung
himself
face
down
on
the
snow
and
wept
no
one
in
lutchínovko
recognised
the
former
jolly
amiable
vasíly
ivánovitch
he
spoke
to
no
one
he
went
off
hunting
from
morning
until
night
with
visible
impatience
endured
the
timid
caresses
of
his
mother
and
jeered
pitilessly
at
his
brothers
and
at
their
wives
both
of
them
were
already
married
so
far
i
have
said
nothing
to
you
i
believe
about
olga
ivánovna
she
had
been
brought
to
lutchínovko
as
an
infant
at
the
breast
she
had
almost
died
on
the
way
olga
ivánovna
had
been
reared
as
the
saying
is
in
the
fear
of
god
and
of
her
parents
it
must
be
confessed
that
iván
andréevitch
and
anna
pávlovna
both
treated
her
like
a
daughter
but
there
was
concealed
in
her
a
feeble
spark
of
that
fire
which
blazed
so
brightly
in
the
soul
of
vasíly
ivánovitch
in
the
meantime
while
iván
andréevitch
own
children
did
not
dare
to
indulge
in
conjectures
concerning
the
strange
speechless
quarrel
between
their
parents
olga
from
her
earliest
years
had
been
disturbed
and
pained
by
the
position
of
anna
pávlovna
like
vasíly
she
loved
independence
all
oppression
revolted
her
she
had
attached
herself
to
her
benefactress
with
all
the
powers
of
her
soul
she
hated
old
lutchínoff
and
more
than
once
as
she
sat
at
table
she
had
fixed
upon
him
such
sombre
glances
that
even
the
man
who
was
serving
the
viands
felt
frightened
iván
andréevitch
did
not
notice
all
those
glances
because
in
general
he
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
his
family
at
first
anna
pávlovna
endeavoured
to
exterminate
this
hatred
in
her
but
several
bold
questions
on
olga
part
forced
her
to
complete
silence
iván
andréevitch
children
adored
olga
and
the
old
woman
loved
her
also
although
with
rather
a
cold
affection
prolonged
sorrow
had
crushed
all
cheerfulness
all
strong
feeling
in
this
poor
woman
nothing
so
clearly
proves
vasíly
bewitching
amiability
as
the
fact
that
he
made
even
his
mother
love
him
ardently
effusions
of
tenderness
on
the
part
of
children
was
not
in
the
spirit
of
that
age
and
therefore
it
is
not
surprising
that
olga
did
not
venture
to
display
her
devotion
although
she
always
kissed
anna
pávlovna
hand
with
particular
respect
in
the
evening
when
she
bade
her
she
was
barely
able
to
read
and
write
twenty
years
later
russian
girls
began
to
read
novels
in
the
style
of
the
adventures
of
marquis
fanfan
and
lolotte
of
alexyéi
or
the
cot
in
the
forest
they
began
to
learn
to
play
on
the
clavichord
and
to
sing
romances
in
the
style
of
the
following
once
very
familiar
song
men
in
the
light
cling
to
us
like
flies
and
so
forth
but
in
the
olga
ivánovna
was
born
in
the
year
our
rustic
beauties
had
no
conception
of
all
these
accomplishments
it
would
be
difficult
for
us
now
to
picture
to
ourselves
a
young
russian
girl
of
good
birth
of
that
epoch
we
can
it
is
true
judge
from
our
grandmothers
as
to
the
degree
of
education
of
noble
gentlewomen
in
the
times
of
katherine
ii
but
how
is
one
to
distinguish
that
which
was
inculcated
in
them
in
the
course
of
their
long
life
from
that
which
they
were
in
the
days
of
their
youth
olga
ivánovna
spoke
a
little
french
but
with
a
strong
russian
accent
in
her
day
there
was
no
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
the
in
a
word
with
all
her
good
qualities
she
was
nevertheless
a
decided
and
probably
in
the
simplicity
of
her
heart
she
more
than
once
administered
chastisement
with
her
own
hands
to
some
unlucky
maid
some
time
before
vasíly
ivánovitch
arrival
olga
ivánovna
had
been
betrothed
to
a
neighbour
pável
afanásievitch
rogatchyóff
an
extremely
and
honourable
man
nature
had
forgotten
to
endow
him
with
gall
his
own
servants
did
not
obey
him
they
sometimes
all
went
off
from
the
first
to
the
last
of
them
and
left
poor
rogatchyóff
without
any
dinner
but
nothing
could
disturb
the
tranquillity
of
his
soul
he
had
been
distinguished
even
from
his
childhood
by
his
obesity
and
sluggishness
he
had
never
served
anywhere
and
he
was
fond
of
going
to
church
and
singing
in
the
choir
look
at
that
round
face
gentlemen
gaze
at
that
tranquil
brilliant
smile
does
not
it
make
you
feel
cheerful
yourselves
once
in
a
while
his
father
had
driven
over
to
lutchínovko
and
had
brought
with
him
on
festival
days
his
pávlusha
whom
the
little
lutchínoffs
tormented
in
every
possible
way
pávlusha
grew
up
began
to
go
to
iván
andréevitch
of
his
own
accord
fell
in
love
with
olga
ivánovna
and
offered
her
his
hand
and
his
heart
not
to
her
personally
but
to
her
benefactors
her
benefactors
gave
their
consent
they
never
even
thought
of
asking
olga
ivánovna
whether
she
liked
rogatchyóff
at
that
epoch
as
our
grandmothers
used
to
say
such
luxuries
were
not
in
fashion
but
olga
speedily
got
used
to
her
betrothed
it
was
impossible
not
to
grow
attached
to
that
gentle
indulgent
being
rogatchyóff
had
received
no
education
whatsoever
all
he
could
say
in
french
was
bonzhour
and
in
secret
he
even
regarded
that
word
as
improper
and
some
jester
had
also
taught
him
the
following
which
professed
to
be
a
french
song
sónetchka
sónetchka
que
de
moi
i
adore
you
mais
je
ne
peux
he
was
always
humming
this
song
in
an
undertone
when
he
felt
in
good
spirits
his
father
also
was
a
man
of
indescribably
kind
disposition
he
was
forever
going
about
in
a
long
nankeen
coat
and
no
matter
what
was
said
to
him
he
assented
to
everything
with
a
smile
from
the
time
of
pável
afanásievitch
betrothal
both
the
rogatchyóffs
father
and
son
began
to
bustle
about
frightfully
they
made
over
their
house
they
built
on
various
galleries
they
chatted
in
friendly
wise
with
the
workmen
they
treated
them
to
vodka
they
did
not
manage
to
finish
all
the
additional
building
by
winter
so
they
deferred
the
wedding
until
the
summer
in
the
summer
iván
andréevitch
died
and
the
wedding
was
postponed
until
the
following
spring
in
the
winter
vasíly
ivánovitch
arrived
rogatchyóff
was
introduced
to
him
vasíly
received
him
coldly
and
carelessly
and
in
the
course
of
time
frightened
him
to
such
a
degree
by
his
arrogant
treatment
that
poor
rogatchyóff
quivered
like
a
leaf
at
his
mere
appearance
maintained
silence
and
smiled
constrainedly
vasíly
once
came
near
driving
him
off
for
good
by
offering
to
bet
with
him
that
he
rogatchyóff
was
unable
to
stop
smiling
poor
pável
afanásievitch
almost
wept
with
confusion
but
is
an
actual
fact
the
smile
the
very
stupid
constrained
smile
would
not
quit
his
face
and
vasíly
slowly
toyed
with
the
ends
of
his
neckcloth
and
stared
at
him
in
quite
too
scornful
a
manner
pável
afanásievitch
father
also
learned
of
vasíly
arrival
and
a
few
days
later
for
the
sake
of
the
greater
solemnity
he
set
out
for
lutchínovko
with
the
intention
of
congratulating
the
amiable
visitor
on
his
arrival
in
his
native
parts
afanásy
lúkitch
was
renowned
throughout
the
whole
countryside
for
his
eloquence
that
is
to
say
for
his
ability
to
utter
without
hesitation
a
rather
long
and
speech
with
a
slight
admixture
of
bookish
words
alas
on
this
occasion
he
did
not
maintain
his
reputation
he
became
confused
much
worse
than
his
son
pável
afanásievitch
he
stammered
out
something
very
unintelligible
and
although
he
had
never
touched
vodka
in
his
life
having
this
time
by
way
of
countenance
drunk
a
small
glassful
he
had
found
vasíly
at
luncheon
he
had
endeavoured
at
least
to
clear
his
throat
with
a
certain
amount
of
independence
and
had
not
produced
the
smallest
sound
as
he
set
out
for
home
pável
afanásievitch
whispered
to
his
parent
well
dear
little
father
afanásy
lúkitch
replied
to
him
with
irritation
also
in
a
whisper
do
mention
it
the
rogatchyóffs
began
to
come
more
rarely
to
lutchínovko
but
they
were
not
the
only
ones
whom
vasíly
intimidated
he
aroused
in
his
brothers
in
their
wives
even
in
anna
pávlovna
herself
a
painful
and
involuntary
sense
of
discomfort
they
began
to
avoid
him
in
all
possible
ways
vasíly
could
not
help
noticing
this
but
apparently
he
had
no
intention
of
altering
his
behaviour
to
them
when
all
of
a
sudden
at
the
beginning
of
the
spring
he
again
revealed
himself
as
the
same
amiable
charming
man
they
had
previously
known
him
to
be
the
first
revelation
of
this
sudden
change
was
on
the
occasion
of
vasíly
unexpected
call
on
the
rogatchyóffs
afanásy
lúkitch
in
particular
was
thoroughly
daunted
by
the
sight
of
lutchínoff
calash
but
his
fear
very
speedily
vanished
never
had
vasíly
been
more
amiable
and
merry
he
linked
his
arm
in
the
arm
of
young
rogatchyóff
walked
out
with
him
to
inspect
the
buildings
chatted
with
the
carpenters
gave
them
advice
himself
made
a
few
notches
with
the
axe
ordered
them
to
show
him
afanásy
lúkitch
himself
drove
them
at
the
end
of
a
rope
and
altogether
by
his
cordial
amiability
reduced
the
to
such
a
condition
that
they
both
repeatedly
embraced
him
at
home
also
vasíly
turned
all
heads
for
a
few
days
as
of
yore
he
devised
various
amusing
games
he
procured
musicians
invited
in
the
neighbours
of
both
sexes
narrated
the
of
the
town
to
the
old
ladies
in
the
most
diverting
manner
paid
some
court
to
the
young
women
invented
amusements
fireworks
and
so
forth
in
a
word
he
enlivened
everything
and
everybody
the
sad
gloomy
house
of
the
lutchínoffs
was
suddenly
converted
into
a
noisy
brilliant
enchanting
sort
of
dwelling
of
which
the
whole
countryside
this
sudden
change
amazed
many
delighted
all
and
various
rumours
got
into
circulation
the
knowing
ones
said
that
some
hidden
trouble
had
up
to
that
time
been
afflicting
vasíly
ivánovitch
that
the
possibility
of
returning
to
the
capital
had
presented
itself
to
him
but
no
one
divined
the
true
cause
of
vasíly
ivánovitch
regeneration
olga
ivánovna
gentlemen
was
very
far
from
being
but
her
beauty
consisted
rather
in
remarkable
softness
and
freshness
of
person
in
a
tranquil
charm
of
movement
than
in
strict
regularity
of
features
nature
had
endowed
her
with
a
certain
independence
her
education
she
had
been
reared
an
orphan
had
developed
in
her
caution
and
firmness
olga
did
not
belong
to
the
category
of
quiet
and
languid
young
gentlewomen
but
one
feeling
alone
had
fully
ripened
in
her
hatred
for
her
benefactor
however
other
and
more
womanly
passions
also
could
flame
up
in
olga
ivánovna
soul
with
unusual
unhealthy
force
but
there
was
in
her
none
of
that
proud
coldness
nor
that
compact
strength
of
soul
nor
that
selfish
concentration
without
which
every
passion
speedily
the
first
outbursts
of
such
souls
are
sometimes
remarkably
violent
but
they
very
soon
undergo
a
change
especially
when
it
becomes
a
question
of
the
ruthless
application
of
accepted
principles
they
fear
the
consequences
and
yet
gentlemen
i
must
confess
to
you
frankly
women
of
that
sort
produce
upon
me
a
very
strong
impression
at
these
words
the
narrator
tossed
off
a
glass
of
water
at
one
nonsense
nonsense
i
thought
as
i
looked
at
his
round
chin
on
you
my
dear
friend
no
one
in
the
world
produces
very
strong
impression
piótr
feódorovitch
went
on
gentlemen
i
believe
in
blood
in
race
there
was
more
blood
in
olga
ivánovna
than
for
example
in
her
nominal
sister
natálya
how
did
that
blood
show
itself
you
ask
why
in
everything
in
the
outline
of
her
hands
and
of
her
lips
in
the
sound
of
her
voice
in
her
glance
in
her
walk
in
the
way
she
dressed
her
hair
in
the
folds
of
her
gown
in
short
in
all
these
trifles
there
was
a
certain
hidden
something
although
i
must
admit
that
that
how
shall
i
express
it
that
distinction
which
had
fallen
to
the
lot
of
olga
ivánovna
would
not
have
attracted
the
attention
of
vasíly
if
he
had
met
her
in
petersburg
but
in
the
country
in
the
wilds
she
not
only
excited
his
attention
but
even
altogether
was
the
sole
cause
of
the
change
of
which
i
have
just
spoken
judge
for
yourselves
vasíly
ivánovitch
was
fond
of
enjoying
life
he
could
not
help
being
bored
in
the
country
his
brothers
were
fellows
but
extremely
limited
in
mind
he
had
nothing
in
common
with
them
his
sister
natálya
and
her
husband
had
had
four
children
in
the
space
of
three
years
between
her
and
vasíly
lay
a
whole
abyss
anna
pávlovna
went
to
church
prayed
fasted
and
prepared
herself
for
death
there
remained
only
olga
a
rosy
timid
charming
young
girl
at
first
vasíly
did
not
notice
her
and
who
would
turn
his
attention
on
an
adopted
child
an
orphan
a
foundling
one
day
at
the
very
beginning
of
spring
he
was
walking
through
the
garden
and
with
his
cane
switching
off
the
heads
of
the
chicory
those
stupid
yellow
flowers
which
make
their
appearance
in
such
abundance
first
of
all
in
the
meadows
as
yet
hardly
he
was
strolling
in
the
garden
in
front
of
the
house
raised
his
head
and
beheld
olga
she
was
sitting
with
her
side
to
the
window
and
gazing
pensively
at
a
striped
kitten
which
purring
and
blinking
had
cuddled
down
on
her
lap
and
with
great
satisfaction
was
presenting
its
little
nose
to
the
spring
sunshine
already
fairly
brilliant
olga
ivánovna
wore
a
white
with
short
sleeves
her
bare
as
yet
not
shoulders
and
arms
breathed
forth
freshness
and
health
a
small
cap
discreetly
confined
her
thick
soft
silky
locks
her
face
was
slightly
flushed
she
had
not
been
long
awake
her
slender
supple
neck
was
bent
forward
so
charmingly
her
unconfined
form
reposed
so
engagingly
and
modestly
that
vasíly
ivánovitch
a
great
connoisseur
involuntarily
halted
and
took
a
look
it
suddenly
came
into
his
head
that
olga
ivánovna
ought
not
to
be
left
in
her
pristine
ignorance
that
in
time
she
might
turn
out
to
be
a
very
charming
and
very
amiable
woman
he
crept
up
to
the
window
raised
himself
on
tiptoe
and
imprinted
a
silent
kiss
on
olga
ivánovna
smooth
white
arm
a
little
below
the
olga
screamed
and
sprang
to
her
feet
the
kitten
elevated
its
tail
and
leaped
into
the
garden
vasíly
ivánovitch
detained
her
with
his
hand
olga
blushed
all
over
to
her
very
ears
he
began
to
jest
at
her
fright
invited
her
to
walk
with
him
but
suddenly
olga
ivánovna
noticed
the
negligence
of
her
attire
more
swiftly
than
the
doe
she
slipped
into
the
next
room
that
same
day
vasíly
set
off
for
the
rogatchyóffs
he
suddenly
grew
gay
and
brightened
up
in
spirit
vasíly
did
not
fall
in
love
with
olga
no
one
must
not
trifle
with
the
word
love
he
had
found
for
himself
an
occupation
he
had
set
himself
a
task
and
was
rejoicing
with
the
joy
of
an
active
man
he
never
even
called
to
mind
the
fact
that
she
was
his
mother
adopted
child
the
betrothed
of
another
man
he
did
not
deceive
himself
for
a
single
instant
he
was
very
well
aware
that
she
could
not
be
his
wife
perhaps
passion
was
his
excuse
not
a
lofty
not
a
noble
passion
is
true
but
nevertheless
a
tolerably
strong
and
torturing
passion
of
course
he
did
not
fall
in
love
like
a
child
he
did
not
surrender
himself
to
unbounded
raptures
he
knew
well
what
he
wanted
and
what
he
was
aiming
at
vasíly
ivánovitch
possessed
to
perfection
the
ability
to
win
the
favour
of
others
even
of
those
who
were
prejudiced
or
timid
olga
speedily
ceased
to
shun
him
vasíly
ivánovitch
introduced
her
into
a
new
world
he
imported
a
clavichord
for
her
gave
her
music
lessons
he
played
very
fairly
himself
on
the
flute
he
read
books
to
her
he
had
long
talks
with
her
the
poor
young
head
was
turned
vasíly
had
completely
subjugated
her
he
knew
how
to
talk
to
her
about
that
which
hitherto
had
been
foreign
to
her
and
to
talk
in
a
language
which
she
understood
olga
gradually
brought
herself
to
express
all
her
feelings
to
him
he
helped
her
suggested
to
her
the
words
which
she
could
not
find
he
did
not
startle
her
he
now
repressed
now
encouraged
her
impulses
vasíly
occupied
himself
with
her
education
not
out
of
a
disinterested
desire
to
awaken
and
develop
her
abilities
he
simply
wanted
to
bring
her
somewhat
closer
to
him
and
he
knew
moreover
that
it
is
easier
to
attract
an
inexperienced
shy
but
vain
young
girl
by
the
mind
than
by
the
heart
even
if
olga
had
been
a
remarkable
being
vasíly
could
not
possibly
have
observed
it
because
he
treated
her
like
a
child
but
you
already
know
gentlemen
that
there
was
nothing
noteworthy
about
olga
vasíly
strove
as
much
as
possible
to
work
on
her
imagination
and
often
of
an
evening
she
would
leave
him
with
such
a
whirl
of
new
images
words
and
thoughts
in
her
head
that
she
was
unable
to
get
to
sleep
until
dawn
and
sighing
sadly
she
pressed
her
burning
cheeks
against
her
cold
pillows
or
she
rose
and
went
to
the
window
and
gazed
timorously
and
eagerly
into
the
gloom
vasíly
filled
every
moment
of
her
life
she
could
not
think
of
any
one
else
she
soon
ceased
to
take
any
notice
of
rogatchyóff
vasíly
being
a
shrewd
and
clever
man
did
not
speak
to
olga
in
his
presence
but
he
either
confused
him
to
the
verge
of
tears
or
got
up
some
boisterous
game
a
stroll
in
the
evening
a
on
the
river
by
night
with
lanterns
and
music
in
a
word
he
did
not
give
pável
afanásievitch
a
chance
to
recover
his
ground
but
despite
all
vasíly
ivánovitch
cleverness
rogatchyóff
was
dimly
conscious
that
he
the
betrothed
and
the
future
husband
of
olga
had
become
as
it
were
a
stranger
to
her
but
in
his
infinite
he
was
afraid
of
wounding
her
by
a
reproach
although
he
really
loved
her
and
prized
her
affection
when
he
was
alone
with
her
he
did
not
know
what
to
talk
about
and
merely
endeavoured
to
serve
her
in
every
possible
way
two
months
passed
every
trace
of
independence
of
will
disappeared
in
olga
the
weak
and
taciturn
rogatchyóff
could
not
serve
her
as
a
prop
she
did
not
even
try
to
resist
the
fascination
and
with
a
sinking
heart
she
gave
herself
unconditionally
to
vasíly
olga
ivánovna
it
is
probable
then
learned
the
joys
of
love
but
not
for
long
although
vasíly
for
the
lack
of
any
other
occupation
not
only
did
not
discard
her
but
even
became
attached
to
her
and
petted
her
yet
olga
lost
herself
to
such
a
degree
that
she
did
not
find
bliss
even
in
love
and
nevertheless
she
was
unable
to
tear
herself
away
from
vasíly
she
began
to
be
afraid
of
everything
she
did
not
dare
to
think
she
talked
of
nothing
she
ceased
to
read
she
became
a
prey
to
melancholy
sometimes
vasíly
succeeded
in
drawing
her
after
him
and
making
her
forget
everybody
and
everything
but
on
the
following
day
he
found
her
pale
and
silent
with
cold
hands
with
a
senseless
smile
on
her
lips
a
decidedly
difficult
time
began
for
vasíly
but
no
difficulties
could
daunt
him
he
concentrated
himself
completely
like
an
expert
gambler
he
could
not
count
upon
olga
ivánovna
in
the
slightest
degree
she
was
incessantly
betraying
herself
paling
and
blushing
and
weeping
her
new
rôle
was
beyond
her
strength
vasíly
toiled
for
two
in
his
boisterous
and
noisy
joy
only
an
experienced
observer
could
have
detected
a
feverish
tenseness
he
played
with
his
brothers
his
sisters
the
rogatchyóffs
the
neighbours
both
men
and
women
as
though
they
had
been
pawns
he
was
eternally
on
the
alert
he
never
allowed
a
single
glance
a
single
movement
to
escape
him
although
he
appeared
to
be
the
most
of
mortals
every
morning
he
entered
into
battle
and
every
evening
he
celebrated
a
victory
he
was
not
in
the
least
oppressed
by
this
strange
activity
he
slept
four
hours
a
day
he
ate
very
little
and
was
healthy
fresh
and
gay
in
the
meantime
the
was
approaching
vasíly
succeeded
in
convincing
pável
afanásievitch
himself
of
the
necessity
of
a
postponement
then
he
despatched
him
to
moscow
to
make
some
purchases
and
himself
entered
into
correspondence
with
his
petersburg
friends
he
exerted
himself
not
so
much
out
of
compassion
for
olga
ivánovna
as
out
of
a
desire
and
love
for
fuss
and
bustle
moreover
he
had
begun
to
grow
tired
of
olga
ivánovna
and
more
than
once
already
after
a
fierce
outburst
of
passion
he
had
looked
at
her
as
he
had
been
wont
to
look
at
rogatchyóff
lutchínoff
always
remained
a
puzzle
to
every
one
in
the
very
coldness
of
his
implacable
spirit
you
felt
conscious
of
the
presence
of
a
strange
almost
southern
flame
and
in
the
maddest
heat
of
passion
cold
emanated
from
that
in
the
presence
of
others
he
upheld
olga
ivánovna
as
before
but
when
he
was
alone
with
her
he
played
with
her
as
a
cat
plays
with
a
mouse
he
either
terrified
her
with
sophisms
or
he
exhibited
heavy
and
vicious
tedium
or
in
conclusion
he
threw
himself
at
her
feet
again
swept
her
away
as
a
whirlwind
sweeps
a
chip
and
he
was
not
then
pretending
to
be
in
love
but
really
was
swooning
with
it
himself
one
day
quite
late
in
the
evening
vasíly
was
sitting
alone
in
his
own
room
and
attentively
perusing
the
latest
letters
he
had
received
from
petersburg
when
suddenly
the
door
creaked
softly
and
paláshka
olga
ivánovna
maid
entered
what
dost
thou
want
vasíly
asked
her
quite
curtly
my
mistress
begs
that
you
will
come
to
her
i
ca
at
present
go
away
well
why
dost
thou
stand
there
he
went
on
perceiving
that
paláshka
did
not
leave
the
room
my
mistress
ordered
me
to
say
that
there
is
very
great
need
sir
well
but
what
the
matter
please
to
see
for
yourself
sir
vasíly
rose
with
vexation
tossed
the
letters
into
a
casket
and
betook
himself
to
olga
ivánovna
she
was
sitting
alone
in
a
corner
pale
and
motionless
what
do
you
want
he
asked
her
not
very
politely
olga
looked
at
him
and
with
a
shudder
covered
her
eyes
what
ails
you
what
the
matter
with
thee
olga
he
took
her
hand
olga
ivánovna
hand
was
as
cold
as
ice
she
tried
to
speak
and
her
voice
died
away
the
poor
woman
had
no
doubt
left
in
her
mind
as
to
her
condition
vasíly
was
somewhat
disconcerted
olga
ivánovna
room
was
a
couple
of
paces
from
the
bedroom
of
anna
pávlovna
vasíly
cautiously
seated
himself
beside
olga
kissed
and
warmed
her
hands
and
argued
with
her
in
a
whisper
she
listened
to
him
and
shivered
silently
slightly
paláshka
stood
in
the
doorway
and
softly
wiped
away
her
tears
in
the
adjoining
room
a
pendulum
was
beating
heavily
and
regularly
and
the
breathing
of
a
sleeper
was
audible
olga
ivánovna
torpor
dissolved
at
last
in
tears
and
dull
sobs
tears
are
the
equivalent
of
a
after
them
a
person
is
always
quieter
when
olga
ivánovna
had
become
somewhat
composed
and
only
sobbed
convulsively
from
time
to
time
like
a
child
vasíly
knelt
down
before
her
and
with
caresses
and
tender
promises
soothed
her
completely
gave
her
a
drink
of
water
put
her
to
bed
and
went
away
all
night
long
he
did
not
undress
himself
wrote
two
or
three
letters
burned
two
or
three
papers
got
out
a
golden
locket
with
the
portrait
of
a
and
woman
with
a
bold
sensual
face
gazed
long
at
her
features
and
paced
his
chamber
in
thought
on
the
following
morning
at
tea
he
beheld
with
a
good
deal
of
dissatisfaction
poor
olga
reddened
swollen
eyes
and
pale
distraught
face
after
breakfast
he
proposed
to
her
that
she
should
take
a
stroll
with
him
in
the
park
olga
followed
vasíly
like
an
obedient
sheep
but
when
two
hours
later
she
returned
from
the
park
she
looked
dreadfully
she
told
anna
pávlovna
that
she
felt
ill
and
went
to
bed
during
the
walk
vasíly
had
announced
to
her
with
all
due
penitence
that
he
was
secretly
married
he
was
just
as
much
a
bachelor
as
i
am
olga
ivánovna
did
not
fall
down
in
a
swoon
people
fall
in
swoons
only
on
the
stage
but
she
became
suddenly
petrified
although
she
not
only
had
not
been
hoping
to
marry
vasíly
ivánovitch
but
had
even
somehow
been
afraid
to
think
of
it
vasíly
began
to
demonstrate
to
her
the
necessity
of
parting
from
him
and
marrying
rogatchyóff
olga
ivánovna
looked
at
him
with
dumb
horror
vasíly
talked
coldly
practically
sensibly
he
blamed
himself
he
expressed
regret
but
all
his
arguments
wound
up
with
the
following
words
we
must
act
olga
lost
her
head
completely
she
was
frightened
and
ashamed
dismal
heavy
despair
took
possession
of
her
she
longed
for
death
and
sadly
awaited
vasíly
decision
we
must
confess
all
to
my
mother
he
said
at
last
olga
turned
deadly
pale
her
limbs
gave
way
beneath
her
do
be
frightened
do
be
frightened
vasíly
kept
repeating
rely
on
me
i
will
not
forsake
thee
i
will
arrange
everything
trust
in
me
the
poor
woman
gazed
at
him
with
love
yes
with
love
and
with
profound
though
hopeless
devotion
i
will
arrange
everything
everything
said
vasíly
to
her
at
parting
and
for
the
last
time
kissed
her
hands
olga
ivánovna
had
just
risen
from
her
bed
on
the
following
morning
when
her
door
opened
and
anna
pávlovna
made
her
appearance
on
the
threshold
she
was
supported
by
vasíly
silently
she
made
her
way
to
an
and
silently
seated
herself
vasíly
stood
beside
her
he
seemed
composed
his
brows
were
contracted
and
his
lips
were
slightly
parted
anna
pávlovna
pale
indignant
wrathful
tried
to
speak
but
her
voice
failed
her
olga
ivánovna
with
terror
took
in
in
a
single
glance
her
benefactress
and
her
lover
she
felt
a
frightful
sinking
at
the
heart
with
a
shriek
she
fell
down
on
her
knees
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
so
it
is
true
it
is
true
whispered
anna
pávlovna
and
bent
toward
her
answer
she
went
on
harshly
seizing
olga
by
the
arm
mamma
rang
out
vasíly
brazen
voice

said
vasíly
slowly
that
one
word
shook
anna
pávlovna
violently
she
leaned
against
the
back
of
her
chair
and
fell
to
sobbing
olga
ivánovna
softly
raised
her
head
and
attempted
to
fling
herself
at
the
old
woman
feet
but
vasíly
restrained
her
raised
her
up
and
seated
her
in
another
anna
pávlovna
continued
to
weep
and
whisper
incoherent
words
listen
mamma
began
vasíly
do
be
so
overwhelmed
this
calamity
can
still
be
alleviated
if
rogatchyóff
olga
ivánovna
shuddered
and
straightened
herself
up

rogatchyóff
pursued
vasíly
with
a
significant
glance
at

added
perceiving
that
olga
was
trying
to
get
at
him
olga
ivánovna

back
in
her
chair

a
reverence
to

and
softly
followed

silently
and
immovably
with
her
eyes
vasíly
hastily

her
ear

and
immediately
withdrew
boursier
he
shouted
as
he
ran
swiftly
down
the
boursier
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
was
seated
in
his
calash
with
his
servant
old
rogatchyóff

not
at
home
that
day
he
had
gone
to
the
county
town
to
buy

for
kaftans
to
clothe
his
retainers
pável
afanásievitch
was
sitting
in
his
study
and
inspecting
a
collection
of
faded
butterflies
elevating
his
eyebrows
and
thrusting
forth
his
lips
he
was
cautiously
turning
about
with
a
pin
the
large
wings
of
the
nocturnal
sphinx
when
suddenly
he
felt
a
small
but
heavy
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
glanced
round
before
him
stood
vasíly
good

vasíly

some
surprise

at

on
a
chair
pável
afanásievitch

about
to

drew
out
his
slender
flexible
french
sword
and
bent
it
slightly
against
the
floor
you

to
fight
with
me
precisely
so
but
vasíly
ivánovitch
pray

the

capital

retorted
vasíly
where

your
sword
eróshka
shouted
pável
afanásievitch
a
man
entered
get
my
sword
yonder
thou
knowest
where
it
is
in
the
garret
and
be
quick
about
it
eróshka
withdrew
pável
afanásievitch
suddenly
turned
extremely
pale
hastily
took
off
his
put
on
a
kaftan
of
a
reddish
hue
with
large
strass
buttons
wound
a
neckcloth
round
his
neck
vasíly
watched
him
and
examined
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
so
how
is
it
to
be
are
we
to
fight
pável
afanásievitch
if
we

rogatchyóff
hastily
buttoning
his
waistcoat

afanásievitch

advice

not
but

ivánovitch
rogatchyóff
interrupted
him
you
will
either
kill
me
or
maim
me
i
know
but
i
have
no
intention
of
losing
my
honour
if
i
must
die
i
will
eróshka
entered
and
hurriedly
handed
rogatchyóff
a
wretched
little
old
sword
in
a
cracked
leather
scabbard
at
that
time
all
nobles
wore
swords
when
they
had
powdered
hair
but
the
nobles
of
the
steppes
only
powdered
their
hair
a
couple
of
times
a
year
eróshka
retreated
to
the
door
and
fell
to
weeping
pável
afanásievitch
thrust
him
out
of
the
room
but
vasíly
ivánovitch
he
remarked
with
some
agitation
i
can
not
fight
with
you
instantly
permit
me
to
defer
our
duel
until
my
father
is
not
at
home
and
it
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
to
put
my
affairs
in
order
in
case
of
a
catastrophe
i
see
that
you
are
beginning
to
quail
again
my
dear
sir
no
no
vasíly
ivánovitch
but
judge
for
yourself
listen
shouted
lutchínoff
you
are
driving
me
out
of
patience
either
give
me
your
word
to
marry
immediately
or
fight
or
i
will
trounce
you
with
a
cudgel
like
a
coward
do
you
understand
let
us
go
into
the
park
replied
rogatchyóff
between
his
teeth
but
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
the
old
nurse
efímovna
all
dishevelled
forced
her
way
into
the
room
fell
on
her
knees
before
rogatchyóff
and
clasped
his
feet
my
dear
little
father
she
wailed
my
child
what
is
this
thou
art
projecting
do
not
ruin
us
miserable

will
kill

my
dear
little
dove
but
only
give
us
the
command

the
command
and

that
insolent
fellow
with
our
caps
pável
afanásievitch
my
darling
child
have
the
fear
of
god
before
thine
eyes
a
multitude
of
pale
and
agitated
faces
showed
themselves
in
the
doorway
the
red
beard
of
the
elder
even
made
its
appearance
let
me
go
efímovna
let
me
go
muttered
rogatchyóff
i
will
not
let
thee
go
my
own
one
i
will
not
let
thee
go
what
art
thou
doing
dear
little
father
what
art
thou
doing
and
what
will
afanásy
lúkitch
say
why
he
will
drive
all
of
us
out
of
the
white
world
and
why
do
ye
stand
there
seize
the
unbidden
guest
by
the
arms
and
lead
him
forth
from
the
house
that
no
trace
of
him
may
remain
rogatchyóff
shouted
vasíly
ivánovitch
menacingly
thou
hast
gone
crazy
efímovna
thou
art
disgracing
me
said
pável
go
away
go
with
god
blessing
and
begone
all
of
you
do
you
hear

vasíly
ivánovitch
walked
swiftly
to
the
open
window
drew
out
a
small
silver
whistle
and
whistled
lightly
boursier
answered
close
at
hand
lutchínoff
immediately
turned
to
pável
afanásievitch
how
is
this
comedy
to
end
vasíly
ivánovitch
i
will
come
to
you
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
crazy
woman
eh
i
see
that
it
is
useless
to
talk
long
with
you
said
vasíly
and
swiftly
raised
his
cane
pável
afanásievitch
dashed
forward
thrust
aside
efímovna
seized
his
sword
and
rushed
through
the
other
door
into
the
park
vasíly
darted
after
him
they
both
ran
to
a
wooden
arbour
artfully
painted
in
the
chinese
manner
locked
themselves
in
and
bared
their
swords
rogatchyóff
had
once
upon
a
time
taken
lessons
in
fencing
but
he
barely
knew
how
to
parry
properly
the
blades
crossed
vasíly
was
evidently
playing
with
rogatchyóff
sword
pável
afanásievitch
sighed
turned
pale
and
gazed
with
consternation
into
lutchínoff
face
in
the
meanwhile
cries
resounded
in
the
park
a
throng
of
people
rushed
to
the
arbour
suddenly
rogatchyóff
heard
a
senile
roar
he
recognised
his
father
voice
afanásy
lúkitch
hatless
and
with
dishevelled
locks
was
running
in
front
of
all
waving
his
arms
despairingly
with
a
powerful
and
unexpected
turn
of
his
blade
vasíly
knocked
the
sword
from
pável
afanásievitch
hand
marry
brother
he
said
to
stop
being
a
fool
i
will
not
marry
whispered
rogatchyóff
closed
his
eyes
and
trembled
all
over
afanásy
lúkitch
began
to
pound
on
the
door
of
the
arbour
thou
wilt
not
shouted
vasíly
rogatchyóff
shook
his
head
in
the
negative
well
then
the
devil
take
thee
poor
pável
afanásievitch
fell

lutchínoff
sword

pierced
his
heart
the
door
burst
open
old
rogatchyóff
rushed
into
the
arbour
but
vasíly
had
already
managed
to
spring
out
of
the
window
two
hours
later
he
entered
olga
ivánovna
room
she
darted
to
meet
him
in
affright
he
silently
bowed
to
her
drew
out
his
sword
and
pierced
pável
afanásievitch
portrait
at
the
place
of
the
heart
olga
shrieked
and
fell
senseless
on
the
floor
vasíly
directed
his
steps
to
anna
pávlovna
he
found
her
in
the
room
of
the
holy
pictures
mamma
he
said
we
are
avenged
the
poor
old
woman
shuddered
and
went
on
praying
a
week
later
vasíly
took
his
departure
for
petersburg
and
two
years
afterward
he
returned
to
the
country
crippled
with
paralysis
and
speechless
he
no
longer
found
either
anna
pávlovna
or
olga
ivánovna
alive

soon
died
himself
in
the

i
passa

colli
e
vieni
allegramente
non
ti
curar
di
tanta
compania
vieni
pensando
a
me
segretamente
per
tutta
la
via
during
the
whole
course
of
the
summer
i
had
gone
nowhere
so
frequently
as
to
the
large
village
of
glínnoe
situated
twenty
versts
from
my
hamlet
in
the
environs
of
this
village
there
are
in
all
probability
the
very
best
haunts
of
game
in
all
our
county
after
having
tramped
through
all
the
adjacent
and
fields
i
invariably
toward
the
end
of
the
day
turned
aside
into
the
neighbouring
marsh
almost
the
only
one
in
the
countryside
and
thence
returned
to
my
cordial
host
the
elder
of
glínnoe
with
whom
i
always
stopped
it
is
not
more
than
two
versts
from
the
marsh
to
glínnoe
the
entire
road
runs
through
a
valley
and
only
midway
of
the
distance
is
one
compelled
to
cross
a
small
hillock
on
the
crest
of
this
hillock
lies
a
homestead
consisting
of
one
uninhabited
little
and
a
garden
it
almost
always
happened
that
i
passed
it
at
the
very
acme
of
the
sunset
glow
and
i
remember
that
on
every
such
occasion
this
house
with
its
windows
appeared
to
me
like
a
blind
old
man
who
had
come
forth
to
warm
himself
in
the
sunlight
he
is
sitting
dear
man
close
to
the
highway
the
splendour
of
the
sunlight
has
long
since
been
superseded
for
him
by
eternal
gloom
but
he
feels
it
at
least
on
his
upturned
and
outstretched
face
on
his
flushed
cheeks
it
seemed
as
though
no
one
had
lived
in
the
house
itself
for
a
long
time
but
in
a
tiny
detached
wing
in
the
courtyard
lodged
a
decrepit
man
who
had
received
his
freedom
tall
stooping
and
with
expressive
and
impassive
features
he
was
always
sitting
on
a
bench
in
front
of
the
wing
solitary
little
window
gazing
with
sad
pensiveness
into
the
distance
and
when
he
caught
sight
of
me
he
rose
a
little
way
and
saluted
with
that
deliberate
gravity
which
distinguishes
old
who
have
belonged
not
to
the
generation
of
our
fathers
but
to
our
grandfathers
i
sometimes
entered
into
conversation
with
him
but
he
was
not
loquacious
all
i
learned
from
him
was
that
the
farm
on
which
he
dwelt
belonged
to
the
granddaughter
of
his
old
master
a
widow
who
had
a
younger
sister
that
both
of
them
lived
in
towns
and
beyond
the
sea
and
never
showed
themselves
at
home
that
he
was
anxious
to
finish
his
life
as
speedily
as
possible
because
you
eat
and
eat
bread
so
that
you
get
melancholy
so
long
do
you
eat
this
old
man
name
was
lukyánitch
one
day
for
some
reason
or
other
i
tarried
long
in
the
fields
a
very
fair
amount
of
game
had
presented
itself
and
the
day
had
turned
out
fine
for
hunting
from
early
morning
it
had
been
still
and
grey
as
though
thoroughly
permeated
with
evening
i
wandered
far
and
it
was
not
only
already
completely
dark
but
the
moon
had
risen
and
night
had
long
been
standing
in
the
sky
as
the
expression
runs
when
i
reached
the
familiar
farm
i
had
to
pass
along
the
garden
all
around
lay
such
tranquillity
i
crossed
the
broad
road
cautiously
made
my
way
through
the
dusty
nettles
and
leaned
against
the
low
wattled
hedge
motionless
before
me
lay
the
small
garden
all
illuminated
and
as
it
were
soothed
to
stillness
by
the
silvery
rays
of
the
moon
all
fragrant
and
humid
laid
out
in
ancient
fashion
it
consisted
of
a
single
oblong
straight
paths
came
together
exactly
in
the
centre
in
a
circular
thickly
overgrown
with
asters
tall
lindens
surrounded
it
in
an
even
border
in
one
spot
only
was
this
border
a
couple
of
fathoms
in
length
broken
and
through
the
gap
a
part
of
the
house
was
visible
with
two
windows
lighted
to
my
amazement
young
reared
themselves
here
and
there
over
the
meadow
athwart
their
slender
branches
the
nocturnal
sky
gleamed
softly
blue
and
the
dreamy
light
of
the
moon
streamed
down
in
front
of
each
on
the
whitening
grass
lay
its
faint
mottled
shadow
on
one
side
of
the
garden
the
lindens
were
confusedly
green
inundated
with
motionless
light
on
the
other
they
stood
all
black
and
opaque
a
strange
repressed
rustling
arose
at
times
in
their
dense
foliage
they
seemed
to
be
calling
to
the
paths
which
vanished
under
them
as
though
luring
them
beneath
their
dim
canopy
the
whole
sky
was
studded
with
stars
mysteriously
did
their
soft
blue
scintillations
stream
down
from
on
high
they
seemed
to
be
gazing
with
quiet
intentness
at
the
distant
earth
small
thin
clouds
now
and
then
sailed
across
the
moon
momentarily
converting
its
tranquil
gleam
into
an
obscure
but
luminous
mist
everything
was
dreaming
the
air
all
warm
all
perfumed
did
not
even
vibrate
it
only
shivered
now
and
then
as
water
shivers
when
disturbed
by
a
falling
branch
one
was
conscious
of
a
certain
thirst
a
certain
swooning
in
it
i
bent
over
the
fence
a
wild
scarlet
poppy
reared
its
erect
little
stalk
before
me
from
the
matted
grass
a
large
round
drop
of
night
dew
glittered
with
a
dark
gleam
in
the
heart
of
the
open
blossom
everything
was
dreaming
everything
was
taking
its
ease
luxuriously
round
about
everything
seemed
to
be
gazing
upward
stretching
itself
out
motionless
expectant
what
was
it
that
that
warm
not
yet
sleeping
night
was
waiting
for
it
was
waiting
for
a
sound
that
sensitive
stillness
was
waiting
for
a
living
voice
but
everything
maintained
silence
the
nightingales
had
long
since
ceased
their
song
and
the
sudden
booming
of
a
beetle
as
it
flew
past
the
light
smacking
of
a
tiny
fish
in
the
behind
the
lindens
at
the
end
of
the
garden
the
sleepy
whistle
of
a
startled
bird
a
distant
cry
in
the
fields
so
far
away
that
the
ear
could
not
distinguish
whether
it
was
a
man
or
a
wild
animal
or
a
bird
which
had
uttered
it
a
short
brisk
trampling
of
hoofs
on
the
road
all
these
faint
sounds
these
rustlings
only
rendered
the
stillness
more
profound
my
heart
yearned
within
me
with
an
indefinite
feeling
akin
not
precisely
to
expectation
nor
yet
to
a
memory
of
happiness
i
dared
not
stir
i
was
standing
motionless
before
this
motionless
garden
steeped
in
moonlight
and
in
dew
and
without
myself
knowing
why
was
staring
importunately
at
those
two
windows
which
shone
dimly
red
in
the
soft
when
suddenly
a
chord
rang
out
of
the
house
rang
out
and
rolled
forth
in
a
flood
the
air
thundered
back
an
echo
i
gave
an
involuntary
start
the
chord
was
followed
by
the
sound
of
a
woman
voice
i
began
to
listen
eagerly
and
can
i
express
my
amazement
two
years
previously
in
italy
at
sorrento
i
had
heard
that
selfsame
song
that
selfsame
voice
yes
yes
vieni
pensando
a
me
segretamente
it
was
they
i
had
recognised
them
those
were
the
sounds
this
is
the
way
it
had
happened
i
was
returning
home
from
a
long
stroll
on
the
seashore
i
was
walking
swiftly
along
the
street
night
had
long
since
descended
a
magnificent
night
southern
not
calm
and
as
with
us
no
but
all
radiant
sumptuous
and
very
beautiful
like
a
happy
woman
in
her
bloom
the
moon
shone
with
incredible
brilliancy
great
radiant
stars
fairly
throbbed
in
the
sky
the
black
shadows
were
sharply
defined
against
the
ground
illuminated
to
yellowness
on
both
sides
of
the
street
stretched
the
stone
walls
of
gardens
reared
above
them
their
crooked
branches
the
golden
globes
of
heavy
fruit
hidden
amidst
the
interlacing
leaves
were
now
barely
visible
now
glowed
brightly
as
they
ostentatiously
displayed
themselves
in
the
moonlight
on
many
trees
the
blossoms
shone
tenderly
white
the
air
was
all
impregnated
with
fragrance
languishingly
powerful
penetrating
and
almost
heavy
although
inexpressibly
sweet
i
walked
on
and
i
must
confess
having
already
become
accustomed
to
all
these
wonders
i
was
thinking
only
of
how
i
might
most
speedily
reach
my
inn
when
suddenly
from
a
small
pavilion
built
upon
the
very
wall
of
a
garden
along
which
i
was
passing
a
woman
voice
rang
out
it
was
singing
some
song
with
which
i
was
unfamiliar
and
in
its
sounds
there
was
something
so
winning
it
seemed
so
permeated
with
the
passion
and
joyous
expectation
expressed
by
the
words
of
the
song
that
i
instantly
and
involuntarily
halted
and
raised
my
head
there
were
two
windows
in
the
pavilion
but
in
both
the
venetian
blinds
were
lowered
and
through
their
narrow
chinks
a
dull
light
barely
made
its
way
after
having
repeated
vieni
twice
the
voice
became
silent
the
faint
sound
of
strings
was
audible
as
though
of
a
guitar
which
had
fallen
on
the
rug
a
gown
rustled
the
floor
creaked
softly
the
streaks
of
light
in
one
window
disappeared
some
one
had
approached
from
within
and
leaned
against
it
i
advanced
a
couple
of
paces
suddenly
the
blind
clattered
and
flew
open
a
graceful
woman
all
in
white
swiftly
thrust
her
lovely
head
from
the
window
and
stretching
out
her
arms
toward
me
said
tu
i
was
disconcerted
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
but
at
that
same
moment
the
unknown
threw
herself
backward
with
a
faint
shriek
the
blind
slammed
to
and
the
light
in
the
pavilion
grew
still
more
dim
as
though
it
had
been
carried
out
into
another
room
i
remained
motionless
and
for
a
long
time
could
not
recover
myself
the
face
of
the
woman
who
had
so
suddenly
presented
itself
before
me
was
strikingly
beautiful
it
had
flashed
too
rapidly
before
my
eyes
to
permit
of
my
immediately
recalling
each
individual
feature
but
the
general
impression
was
indescribably
powerful
and
profound
i
felt
then
and
there
that
i
should
never
forget
that
countenance
the
moon
fell
straight
on
the
wall
of
the
pavilion
on
the
window
whence
she
had
shown
herself
to
me
and
great
heavens
how
magnificently
had
her
great
dark
eyes
shone
in
its
radiance
in
what
a
heavy
flood
had
her
black
hair
fallen
upon
her
uplifted
rounded
shoulders
how
much
bashful
tenderness
there
had
been
in
the
soft
inclination
of
her
form
how
much
affection
in
her
voice
when
she
had
called
to
me
in
that
hurried
but
resonant
whisper
after
standing
for
quite
a
long
time
on
one
spot
i
at
last
stepped
a
little
aside
into
the
shadow
of
the
opposite
wall
and
began
to
stare
thence
at
the
pavilion
with
a
sort
of
stupid
surprise
and
anticipation
i
listened
listened
with
strained
attention
it
seemed
to
me
now
that
i
heard
some
one
quiet
breathing
behind
the
darkened
window
now
a
rustle
and
quiet
laughter
at
last
steps
resounded
in
the
distance
they
came
nearer
a
man
of
almost
identical
stature
with
myself
made
his
appearance
at
the
end
of
the
street
briskly
strode
up
to
a
gate
directly
beneath
the
pavilion
which
i
had
not
previously
noticed
knocked
twice
with
its
iron
ring
without
looking
about
him
waited
a
little
knocked
again
and
began
to
sing
in
an
undertone
the
gate
opened
he
slipped
noiselessly
through
it
i
started
shook
my
head
threw
my
hands
apart
and
pulling
my
hat
morosely
down
on
my
brows
went
off
home
in
displeasure
on
the
following
day
i
vainly
paced
up
and
down
that
street
for
two
hours
in
the
very
hottest
part
of
the
day
past
the
pavilion
and
that
same
evening
went
away
from
sorrento
without
even
having
visited
house
the
reader
can
now
picture
to
himself
the
amazement
which
suddenly
took
possession
of
me
when
i
heard
that
same
voice
that
same
song
in
the
steppes
in
one
of
the
most
remote
parts
of
russia
now
as
then
it
was
night
now
as
then
the
voice
suddenly
rang
out
from
a
lighted
unfamiliar
room
now
as
then
i
was
alone
my
heart
began
to
beat
violently
within
me
is
not
this
a
dream
i
thought
and
lo
again
the
final
rang
out
can
it
be
that
the
window
will
open
can
it
be
that
the
woman
will
show
herself
in
it
the
window
opened
in
the
window
a
woman
showed
herself
i
instantly
recognised
her
although
a
distance
of
fifty
paces
lay
between
us
although
a
light
cloud
obscured
the
moon
it
was
she
my
unknown
of
sorrento
but
she
did
not
stretch
forth
her
bare
arms
as
before
she
folded
them
quietly
and
leaning
them
on
the
began
to
gaze
silently
and
immovably
at
some
point
in
the
garden
yes
it
was
she
those
were
her
features
her
eyes
the
like
of
which
i
had
never
beheld
now
also
an
ample
white
gown
enfolded
her
limbs
she
seemed
somewhat
plumper
than
in
sorrento
everything
about
exhaled
an
atmosphere
of
the
confidence
and
repose
of
love
the
triumph
of
beauty
of
calm
happiness
for
a
long
time
she
did
not
stir
then
she
cast
a
glance
backward
into
the
room
and
suddenly
straightening
herself
up
exclaimed
thrice
in
a
loud
and
ringing
voice
the
beautiful
sounds
were
wafted
far
far
away
and
for
a
long
time
they
quivered
growing
fainter
and
dying
out
beneath
the
lindens
of
the
garden
and
in
the
fields
behind
me
and
everywhere
everything
around
me
was
filled
for
several
minutes
with
the
voice
of
this
woman
everything
rang
in
response
to
her
rang
with
her
she
shut
the
window
and
a
few
moments
later
the
light
in
the
house
vanished
as
soon
as
i
recovered
myself
and
this
was
not
very
soon
i
must
admit
i
immediately
directed
my
course
along
the
garden
of
the
manor
approached
the
closed
gate
and
peered
through
the
wattled
fence
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
was
visible
in
the
courtyard
in
one
corner
under
a
shed
stood
a
calash
its
front
half
all
bespattered
with
dried
mud
shone
out
sharply
white
in
the
moonlight
the
shutters
of
the
house
were
closed
as
before
i
have
forgotten
to
say
that
for
about
a
week
previous
to
that
day
i
had
not
visited
glínnoe
for
more
than
half
an
hour
i
paced
to
and
fro
in
perplexity
in
front
of
the
fence
so
that
at
last
i
attracted
the
attention
of
the
old
which
nevertheless
did
not
begin
to
bark
at
me
but
merely
looked
at
me
from
under
the
gate
in
a
remarkably
ironical
manner
with
his
purblind
little
eyes
puckered
up
i
understood
his
hint
and
beat
a
retreat
but
before
i
had
managed
to
traverse
half
a
verst
i
suddenly
heard
the
sound
of
a
horse
hoofs
behind
me
in
a
few
minutes
a
rider
mounted
on
a
black
horse
dashed
past
me
at
a
swift
trot
and
swiftly
turning
toward
me
his
face
where
i
could
descry
nothing
save
an
aquiline
nose
and
a
very
handsome
moustache
under
his
military
cap
which
was
pulled
well
down
on
his
brow
turned
into
the
road
and
immediately
vanished
behind
the
forest
so
that
is
he
i
thought
to
myself
and
my
heart
stirred
within
me
in
a
strange
sort
of
way
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
recognised
him
his
figure
really
did
suggest
the
figure
of
the
man
whom
i
had
seen
enter
the
in
sorrento
half
an
hour
later
i
was
in
glínnoe
at
my
host
had
roused
him
and
had
immediately
begun
to
interrogate
him
as
to
the
persons
who
had
arrived
at
the
neighbouring
farm
he
replied
with
an
effort
that
the
ladies
had
arrived
but
what
ladies
why
everybody
knows
what
ladies
he
replied
very
languidly
russians
what
else
should
they
be
russians
of
course
not
foreigners
hey
have
they
been
here
long
not
long
of
course
and
have
they
come
to
stay
long
that
i
do
know
are
they
wealthy
and
that
too
we
do
know
perhaps
they
are
wealthy
did
not
a
gentleman
come
with
them
a
gentleman
yes
a
gentleman
the
elder
sighed
o
okh
o
lord
he
ejaculated
with
a
yawn
there
was
no
gentleman
i
think
there
was
no
gentleman
i
do
know
he
suddenly
added
and
what
sort
of
other
neighbours
are
living
here
what
sort
everybody
knows
what
sort
all
sorts
all
sorts
and
what
are
their
names
whose
the
lady
proprietors
or
the
neighbours
the
lady
proprietors
again
the
elder
yawned
what
are
their
names
he
why
god
knows
what
their
names
are
the
elder
i
think
is
named
anna
feódorovna
and
the
other
no
i
do
know
that
one
name
well
what
their
surname
at
least
their
surname
yes
their
surname
their
family
name
their
family
name
yes
why
as
god
is
my
witness
i
do
know
are
they
young
well
no
they
are
not
how
old
are
they
then
why
the
youngest
must
be
over
forty
thou
art
inventing
the
whole
of
this
the
elder
was
silent
for
a
while
well
you
must
know
best
but
i
do
know
well
thou
art
wound
up
to
say
one
thing
i
exclaimed
with
vexation
knowing
by
experience
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
extracting
anything
lucid
from
a
russian
man
when
once
he
undertakes
to
answer
in
that
way
and
moreover
my
host
had
only
just
thrown
himself
down
to
sleep
and
swayed
forward
slightly
before
every
answer
opening
his
eyes
widely
with
surprise
and
with
difficulty
ungluing
his
lips
smeared
with
the
honey
of
the
first
sweet
slumber
i
gave
up
in
despair
and
declining
supper
went
into
the
barn
i
could
not
get
to
sleep
for
a
long
time
who
is
she
i
kept
incessantly
asking
myself
a
russian
if
a
russian
why
does
she
speak
in
italian
the
elder
declares
that
she
is
not
young
but
he
lying
and
who
is
that
happy
man
positively
i
can
comprehend
nothing
but
what
a
strange
adventure
is
it
possible
that
thus
twice
in
succession
but
i
will
infallibly
find
out
who
she
is
and
why
she
has
come
agitated
by
such
disordered
fragmentary
thoughts
as
these
i
fell
asleep
late
and
saw
strange
visions
now
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
wandering
in
some
desert
in
the
very
blaze
of
noonday
and
suddenly
i
behold
in
front
of
me
a
huge
spot
of
shadow
running
over
the
yellow
sand
i
raise
my
head
is
she
my
beauty
whisking
through
the
air
all
white
with
long
white
wings
and
beckoning
me
to
her
i
dart
after
her
but
she
floats
on
lightly
and
swiftly
and
i
can
not
rise
from
the
ground
and
stretch
out
eager
hands
in
vain
she
says
to
me
as
she
flies
why
hast
thou
not
wings
and
lo
from
all
sides
resounds
every
grain
of
sand
shouts
and
squeaks
at
me
then
rings
out
in
an
intolerable
piercing
trill
i
brush
it
aside
as
i
would
a
gnat
i
seek
her
with
my
eyes
and
already
she
has
become
a
cloud
and
is
floating
upward
softly
toward
the
sun
the
sun
quivers
rocks
laughs
stretches
out
to
meet
her
long
golden
threads
and
now
those
threads
have
enmeshed
her
and
she
melts
into
them
but
i
shout
at
the
top
of
my
lungs
like
a
madman
that
is
not
the
sun
that
is
not
the
sun
that
is
an
italian
spider
who
gave
it
a
passport
for
russia
i
show
him
up
for
what
he
is
i
saw
him
stealing
oranges
from
other
people
then
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
walking
along
a
narrow
mountain
path
i
hurry
onward
i
must
get
somewhere
or
other
as
quickly
as
possible
some
happiness
is
awaiting
me
suddenly
a
vast
cliff
rears
itself
up
in
front
of
me
i
seek
a
passage
i
go
to
the
right
i
go
to
the
left
there
is
no
passage
and
now
behind
the
cliff
a
voice
suddenly
rings
out
passa
quei
it
is
calling
me
that
voice
it
repeats
its
mournful
summons
i
fling
myself
about
in
anguish
i
seek
even
the
smallest
cleft
alas
the
cliff
is
perpendicular
there
is
granite
everywhere
quei
wails
the
voice
again
my
heart
aches
and
i
hurl
my
breast
against
the
smooth
stone
i
scratch
it
with
my
nails
in
my
frenzy
a
dark
passage
suddenly
opens
before
me
swooning
with
joy
i
dash
forward
nonsense
some
one
cries
to
me
thou
shalt
not
pass
i
look
lukyánitch
is
standing
in
front
of
me
and
threatening
and
brandishing
his
arms
i
hastily
fumble
in
my
pockets
i
want
to
bribe
him
but
there
is
nothing
in
my
pockets
lukyánitch
i
say
to
him
let
me
pass
i
will
reward
thee
afterward
you
are
mistaken
signor
lukyánitch
replies
to
me
and
his
face
assumes
a
strange
expression
i
am
not
a
recognise
in
me
don
quixote
de
la
mancha
the
famous
wandering
knight
all
my
life
long
i
have
been
seeking
my
dulcinea
and
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
her
and
i
will
not
tolerate
it
that
you
shall
find
yours
quei
rings
out
again
the
almost
sobbing
voice
stand
aside
signor
i
shout
wrathfully
and
am
on
the
point
of
precipitating
myself
forward
but
the
knight
long
spear
wounds
me
in
the
very
heart
i
fall
dead
i
lie
on
my
back
i
can
not
move
and
lo
i
see
that
she
is
coming
with
a
lamp
in
her
hand
and
elevating
it
with
a
fine
gesture
above
her
head
she
peers
about
her
in
the
gloom
and
creeping
cautiously
up
bends
over
me
so
this
is
he
that
jester
she
says
with
a
disdainful
this
is
he
who
wanted
to
know
who
i
am
and
the
hot
oil
from
her
lamp
drips
straight
upon
my
wounded
heart
psyche
i
exclaim
with
an
effort
and
awake
all
night
long
i
slept
badly
and
was
afoot
before
daybreak
hastily
dressing
and
arming
myself
i
wended
my
way
straight
to
the
manor
my
impatience
was
so
great
that
the
dawn
had
only
just
begun
to
flush
the
sky
when
i
reached
the
familiar
gate
round
me
the
larks
were
singing
the
daws
were
cawing
on
the
birches
but
in
the
house
everything
was
still
buried
in
matutinal
slumber
even
the
dog
was
snoring
behind
the
fence
with
the
anguish
of
expectation
exasperated
almost
to
the
point
of
wrath
i
paced
to
and
fro
on
the
dewy
grass
and
kept
casting
incessant
glances
at
the
and
little
house
which
contained
within
its
walls
that
mysterious
being
suddenly
the
creaked
faintly
opened
and
lukyánitch
made
his
appearance
on
the
threshold
in
some
sort
of
striped
kazák
coat
his
bristling
face
seemed
to
me
more
surly
than
ever
gazing
at
me
not
without
surprise
he
was
on
the
point
of
shutting
the
wicket
again
my
good
fellow
my
good
fellow
i
cried
hastily
what
do
you
want
at
such
an
early
hour
he
returned
slowly
and
dully
tell
me
please
they
say
that
your
mistress
has
arrived
lukyánitch
made
no
reply
for
a
while
she
has
arrived
alone
with
her
sister
were
there
not
guests
with
you
last
night
no
and
he
drew
the
wicket
toward
him
stay
stay
my
dear
fellow
do
me
a
favour
lukyánitch
coughed
and
shivered
with
cold
but
what
is
it
you
want
tell
me
please
how
old
is
your
mistress
lukyánitch
darted
a
suspicious
glance
at
me
how
old
is
the
mistress
i
do
know
she
must
be
over
forty
over
forty
and
how
old
is
her
sister
why
she
in
the
neighbourhood
of
forty
you
do
say
so
and
is
she
who
the
sister
yes
the
sister
lukyánitch
grinned
i
do
know
that
as
a
person
fancies
in
my
opinion
she
is
comely
how
so
because
she
very
a
bit
puny
you
do
say
so
and
has
no
one
except
them
come
hither
no
one
who
should
come
but
that
can
not
be
i
eh
master
there
no
end
of
talking
with
you
apparently
retorted
the
old
man
with
whew
how
cold
it
is
stay
stay
here
something
for
thee
and
i
held
out
to
him
a
quarter
of
a
ruble
which
i
had
prepared
beforehand
but
my
hand
came
into
contact
with
the
swiftly
banged
the
silver
coin
fell
to
the
ground
rolled
away
and
lay
at
my
feet
ah
thou
old
rascal
i
thought
don
quixote
de
la
mancha
evidently
thou
hast
received
orders
to
hold
thy
tongue
but
wait
thou
shalt
not
trick
i
promised
myself
that
i
would
elucidate
the
matter
at
any
cost
for
about
half
an
hour
i
paced
to
and
fro
without
knowing
what
decision
to
adopt
at
last
i
made
up
my
mind
first
to
inquire
in
the
village
precisely
who
had
arrived
at
the
manor
and
who
she
was
then
to
return
and
as
the
saying
runs
not
desist
until
the
matter
was
cleared
and
if
the
unknown
should
come
out
of
the
house
i
would
at
last
see
her
by
daylight
near
at
hand
like
a
living
woman
not
like
a
vision
it
was
about
a
verst
to
the
village
and
i
immediately
betook
myself
thither
stepping
out
lightly
and
alertly
a
strange
audacity
was
seething
and
sparkling
in
my
blood
the
invigorating
freshness
of
the
morning
excited
me
after
the
uneasy
in
the
village
i
learned
from
two
peasants
who
were
on
their
way
to
their
work
everything
which
i
could
learn
from
them
namely
i
learned
that
the
manor
together
with
the
village
which
i
had
entered
was
called
mikhaílovskoe
that
it
belonged
to
the
widow
of
a
major
anna
feódorovna
shlýkoff
that
she
had
with
her
her
sister
an
unmarried
woman
pelagéya
feódorovna
badáeff
by
name
that
both
of
them
were
advanced
in
years
were
wealthy
hardly
ever
lived
at
home
were
always
travelling
about
kept
no
one
in
attendance
on
them
except
two
female
domestic
serfs
and
a
male
cook
that
anna
feódorovna
had
recently
returned
from
moscow
with
no
one
but
her
sister
this
last
circumstance
greatly
perturbed
me
it
was
impossible
to
assume
that
the
peasants
also
had
been
commanded
to
hold
their
peace
about
my
unknown
but
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
concede
that
anna
feódorovna
shlýkoff
a
widow
of
and
that
young
charming
woman
whom
i
had
seen
on
the
previous
evening
were
one
and
the
same
person
pelagéya
feódorovna
judging
from
the
description
was
not
distinguished
for
her
beauty
either
and
in
addition
to
that
at
the
mere
thought
that
the
woman
whom
i
had
seen
at
sorrento
could
bear
the
name
of
pelagéya
and
still
more
of
badáeff
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
laughed
maliciously
and
nevertheless
i
had
beheld
her
the
night
before
in
that
house
i
had
beheld
her
beheld
her
with
my
own
eyes
i
reflected
irritated
enraged
but
still
more
inclined
to
stand
by
my
intention
i
would
have
liked
to
return
at
once
to
the
manor
but
glanced
at
my
watch
it
was
not
yet
six
i
decided
to
wait
a
while
every
one
was
still
asleep
at
the
farm
in
all
probability
and
to
prowl
about
the
house
at
such
an
hour
would
only
serve
to
arouse
unnecessary
suspicion
and
besides
in
front
of
me
stretched
bushes
and
beyond
them
an
aspen
wood
was
visible
i
must
do
myself
the
justice
to
say
that
notwithstanding
the
thoughts
which
were
exciting
me
the
noble
passion
for
the
hunt
had
not
yet
grown
wholly
mute
within
me
perchance
i
thought
i
shall
hit
upon
a
covey
and
that
will
serve
to
pass
away
the
time
i
entered
the
bushes
but
truth
to
tell
i
walked
in
a
very
careless
way
quite
out
of
consonance
with
the
rules
of
the
art
i
did
not
follow
my
dog
constantly
with
my
eyes
i
did
not
snort
over
a
thick
bush
in
the
hope
that
a
black
snipe
would
fly
thence
with
a
whirr
and
a
crash
but
kept
incessantly
looking
at
my
watch
which
never
serves
any
purpose
whatsoever
and
at
last
it
was
going
on
is
time
i
exclaimed
aloud
and
was
on
the
point
of
turning
back
to
the
manor
when
suddenly
a
huge
black
woodcock
actually
did
begin
to
flutter
out
of
the
thick
grass
a
couple
of
paces
from
me
i
fired
at
the
magnificent
bird
and
wounded
it
under
the
wing
it
almost
fell
to
the
ground
but
recovered
itself
started
off
fluttering
its
wings
swiftly
and
diving
toward
the
wood
tried
to
soar
above
the
first
aspens
on
the
edge
but
its
strength
failed
and
it
rolled
headlong
into
the
thicket
it
would
have
been
utterly
unpardonable
to
abandon
such
a
prize
i
strode
briskly
after
it
entered
the
forest
made
a
sign
to
dianka
and
a
few
moments
later
i
heard
a
feeble
clucking
and
flapping
it
was
the
unlucky
woodcock
struggling
under
the
paws
of
my
hound
i
picked
it
up
put
it
in
my
glanced
round
and
remained
rooted
to
the
spot
as
it
were
the
forest
which
i
had
entered
was
very
dense
and
wild
so
that
i
had
with
difficulty
made
my
way
to
the
spot
where
the
bird
had
fallen
but
at
a
short
distance
from
me
wound
a
and
along
this
road
were
riding
on
horseback
my
beauty
and
the
man
who
had
overtaken
me
on
the
night
before
i
recognised
him
by
his
moustache
they
were
riding
softly
in
silence
holding
each
other
by
the
hand
their
horses
were
barely
putting
one
foot
before
the
other
lazily
swaying
from
side
to
side
and
handsomely
stretching
out
their
long
necks
when
i
had
recovered
from
my
first
alarm
precisely
that
alarm
i
can
give
no
other
appellation
to
the
feeling
which
suddenly
seized
upon
me
i
fairly
bored
into
her
with
my
eyes
how
beautiful
she
was
how
enchantingly
her
graceful
form
moved
toward
me
amid
the
emerald
green
soft
shadows
tender
reflections
glided
over
her
over
her
long
grey
habit
over
her
slender
neck
over
her
face
over
her
glossy
black
hair
which
escaped
luxuriantly
from
under
her
hat
but
how
shall
i
transmit
that
expression
of
utter
passionate
bliss
of
a
person
passionate
to
the
point
of
speechlessness
which
breathed
forth
from
her
features
her
head
seemed
to
be
bending
beneath
the
burden
of
it
moist
golden
sparks
glittered
in
her
dark
eyes
which
were
by
her
eyelashes
they
gazed
nowhere
those
happy
eyes
and
the
slender
brows
drooped
over
them
an
irresolute
smile
the
smile
of
profound
happiness
strayed
over
her
lips
it
seemed
as
though
excess
of
happiness
had
wearied
and
even
broken
her
a
little
as
a
flower
in
full
bloom
sometimes
breaks
its
own
stem
both
her
hands
lay
powerless
one
in
the
hand
of
the
man
who
was
riding
by
her
side
the
other
on
her
horse
mane
i
succeeded
in
getting
a
good
look
at
her
and
at
him
also
he
was
a
handsome
stately
man
with
an
face
he
was
gazing
at
her
boldly
and
merrily
and
so
far
as
i
was
able
to
observe
was
admiring
her
not
without
secret
pride
he
was
admiring
her
the
villain
and
was
very
with
himself
and
not
sufficiently
touched
not
sufficiently
moved
precisely
that
moved
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
man
does
deserve
such
devotion
what
soul
even
the
most
beautiful
is
worthy
of
furnishing
another
soul
such
happiness
i
must
say
that
i
was
envious
of
him
in
the
meantime
they
had
both
arrived
on
a
level
with
me
my
dog
suddenly
bounded
out
into
the
road
and
began
to
bark
my
unknown
started
cast
a
swift
glance
around
and
catching
sight
of
me
dealt
her
steed
a
violent
blow
on
the
neck
with
her
whip
the
horse
snorted
reared
up
on
his
hind
legs
threw
both
his
hoofs
forward
simultaneously
and
dashed
off
at
a
gallop
the
man
immediately
gave
the
spur
to
his
black
horse
and
when
i
emerged
by
the
road
into
the
border
of
the
forest
a
few
moments
later
both
of
them
were
already
galloping
off
into
the
golden
distance
across
the
fields
rising
smartly
and
regularly
in
their
saddles
and
were
not
galloping
in
the
direction
of
the
farm
i
gazed
they
speedily
disappeared
behind
a
hillock
brilliantly
illuminated
for
the
last
time
by
the
sun
against
the
dark
line
of
the
horizon
i
stood
and
stood
then
returned
with
slow
steps
to
the
forest
and
sat
down
on
the
path
covering
my
eyes
with
my
i
have
observed
that
after
meeting
strangers
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
close
the
eyes
and
their
features
immediately
start
up
before
you
any
one
can
verify
my
observation
on
the
street
the
more
familiar
the
faces
the
more
difficult
is
it
for
them
to
present
themselves
the
more
indefinite
is
their
impression
you
recall
them
but
you
do
not
see
them
and
you
can
never
possibly
picture
to
yourself
your
own
face
the
very
minutest
separate
feature
is
known
to
you
but
the
entire
image
will
not
constitute
itself
so
then
i
sat
down
closed
my
eyes
and
immediately
beheld
the
unknown
and
her
companion
and
their
horses
and
everything
the
man
smiling
countenance
stood
before
me
with
particular
sharpness
and
distinctness
i
began
to
stare
intently
at
it
it
became
confused
and
dissolved
into
a
sort
of
crimson
mist
and
after
it
her
image
also
floated
away
and
sank
and
would
not
return
well
never
mind
i
thought
at
all
events
i
have
seen
them
seen
them
both
clearly
it
remains
for
me
now
to
find
out
their
names
endeavour
to
find
out
their
names
what
petty
curiosity
but
i
swear
that
it
was
not
curiosity
which
had
flamed
up
in
me
in
truth
it
simply
seemed
to
me
impossible
not
to
discover
eventually
who
they
were
after
accident
had
so
strangely
and
so
persistently
brought
us
together
moreover
my
former
impatient
perplexity
no
longer
existed
it
had
been
replaced
by
a
certain
confused
sorrowful
feeling
of
which
i
was
somewhat
ashamed
i
was
jealous
i
did
not
hasten
back
to
the
farm
i
must
confess
that
i
had
become
ashamed
to
pry
into
the
secrets
of
others
moreover
the
appearance
of
the
fond
pair
by
daylight
in
the
light
of
the
sun
although
it
was
unexpected
and
i
repeat
strange
had
not
exactly
soothed
but
chilled
me
i
no
longer
found
anything
supernatural
miraculous
in
this
occurrence
nothing
resembling
an
impossible
dream
i
began
to
hunt
again
with
greater
assiduity
than
before
but
still
there
were
no
genuine
raptures
i
hit
upon
a
covey
which
engaged
my
attention
for
an
hour
and
a
half
the
young
partridges
did
not
respond
to
my
whistle
for
a
long
time
probably
because
i
did
not
whistle
with
sufficient
objectivity
the
sun
had
already
risen
quite
high
my
watch
indicated
twelve
when
i
directed
my
steps
toward
the
manor
i
walked
without
haste
yonder
at
last
the
little
house
peeped
forth
from
its
hill
i
approached
and
not
without
secret
satisfaction
beheld
lukyánitch
as
of
yore
he
was
sitting
motionless
on
the
bench
in
front
of
the
wing
the
gate
was
closed
also
the
shutters
good
morning
uncle
i
shouted
to
him
from
hast
thou
come
out
to
warm
thyself
lukyánitch
turned
his
gaunt
face
toward
me
and
silently
doffed
his
cap
i
went
up
to
him
good
morning
uncle
good
morning
i
repeated
wishing
to
encourage
why
i
added
unexpectedly
descrying
my
quarterruble
on
the
ground
didst
not
thou
see
it
and
i
pointed
out
to
him
the
silver
circle
half
peeping
from
beneath
the
short
grass
yes
i
saw
it
then
why
didst
thou
not
pick
it
up
because
it
was
my
money
so
i
did
pick
it
up
what
a
fellow
thou
art
brother
i
returned
not
without
embarrassment
and
picking
up
the
coin
i
offered
it
to
him
take
it
take
it
for
tea
much
obliged
lukyánitch
answered
me
with
a
composed
it
is
necessary
i
manage
to
pull
through
without
it
much
obliged
but
i
am
ready
to
give
you
still
more
with
pleasure
i
replied
in
confusion
what
for
please
do
disturb
yourself
much
obliged
for
your
but
we
still
have
a
crust
of
bread
and
perhaps
we
eat
that
up
that
as
it
may
happen
and
he
rose
and
put
out
his
hand
to
the
stay
stay
old
man
i
began
almost
in
desperation
how
uncommunicative
thou
art
really
tell
me
at
least
has
your
mistress
risen
yet
she
has
and
is
she
at
home
no
she
not
at
home
has
she
gone
off
on
a
visit
pray
no
sir
she
has
gone
to
moscow
to
moscow
how
is
that
why
she
was
here
this
morning
she
was
and
she
passed
the
night
here
she
did
and
she
came
hither
recently
yes
what
next
my
good
man
why
this
it
must
be
about
an
hour
since
she
deigned
to
start
back
to
moscow
to
moscow
i
stared
in
petrification
at
lukyánitch
i
had
not
expected
this
i
admit
lukyánitch
stared
at
me
a
crafty
senile
smile
distended
his
withered
lips
and
almost
beamed
in
his
melancholy
eyes
and
did
she
go
away
with
her
sister
i
said
at
last
yes
so
that
now
there
is
no
one
in
the
house
no
one
this
old
man
is
deceiving
me
flashed
through
my
is
not
without
cause
that
he
is
grinning
so
listen
lukyánitch
i
said
aloud
dost
wish
to
do
me
one
favour
what
is
it
you
wish
he
enunciated
slowly
evidently
beginning
to
feel
annoyed
by
my
questions
thou
sayest
that
there
is
no
one
in
the
house
canst
thou
show
it
to
me
i
should
be
very
grateful
to
thee
that
is
you
want
to
inspect
the
rooms
yes
the
rooms
lukyánitch
remained
silent
for
a
space
very
well
he
said
at
pray
enter
and
bending
down
he
stepped
across
the
threshold
of
the
i
followed
him
after
traversing
a
tiny
courtyard
we
ascended
the
tottering
steps
of
the
porch
the
old
man
gave
the
door
a
push
there
was
no
lock
on
it
a
cord
with
a
knot
stuck
out
through
the
we
entered
the
house
it
consisted
in
all
of
five
or
six
rooms
and
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
in
the
faint
light
which
streamed
sparsely
through
the
rifts
in
the
shutters
the
furniture
in
these
rooms
was
extremely
plain
and
decrepit
in
one
of
them
namely
in
the
one
which
opened
on
the
garden
stood
a
small
antiquated
piano
i
raised
its
warped
lid
and
struck
the
keys
a
shrill
hissing
sound
rang
out
and
died
feebly
away
as
though
complaining
of
my
audacity
it
was
impossible
to
discern
from
anything
that
people
had
recently
left
the
house
it
had
a
dead
and
stifling
sort
of
smell
the
odour
of
an
uninhabited
dwelling
here
and
there
indeed
a
discarded
paper
gave
one
to
understand
by
its
whiteness
that
it
had
been
dropped
there
recently
i
picked
up
one
such
bit
of
paper
it
proved
to
be
a
scrap
of
a
letter
on
one
side
in
a
dashing
feminine
handwriting
were
scrawled
the
words
taire
on
the
other
i
made
out
the
word
on
a
small
round
table
near
the
window
stood
a
nosegay
of
flowers
in
a
glass
and
a
green
rumpled
ribbon
was
lying
there
also
i
took
that
ribbon
as
a
lukyánitch
opened
a
narrow
door
pasted
over
with
here
said
he
extending
his
hand
this
here
is
the
bedroom
and
yonder
beyond
it
is
the
room
for
the
maids
and
there
are
no
other
chambers
we
returned
by
way
of
the
and
what
room
is
that
yonder
i
asked
pointing
at
a
broad
white
door
with
a
lock
that
lukyánitch
answered
me
in
a
dull
that
nothing
how
so
because
is
a
and
he
started
to
go
into
the
anteroom
a
can
not
i
look
at
it
what
makes
you
want
to
do
that
master
really
replied
lukyánitch
with
what
is
there
for
you
to
look
at
chests
old
crockery
is
a
and
nothing
more
all
the
same
show
it
to
me
please
old
man
i
said
although
i
was
inwardly
ashamed
of
my
indecent
i
should
like
you
see
i
should
like
to
have
just
such
a
house
myself
at
home
in
my
village
i
was
ashamed
i
could
not
complete
the
sentence
i
had
begun
lukyánitch
stood
with
his
grey
head
bent
on
his
breast
and
stared
at
me
askance
in
a
strange
sort
of
way
show
it
i
said
well
as
you
like
he
replied
at
last
got
the
key
and
reluctantly
opened
the
door
i
glanced
into
the
there
really
was
nothing
noteworthy
about
it
on
the
walls
hung
old
portraits
with
gloomy
almost
black
countenances
and
vicious
eyes
the
floor
was
strewn
with
all
sorts
of
rubbish
well
have
you
seen
all
you
want
asked
lukyánitch
gruffly
yes
thanks
i
hastily
replied
he
slammed
to
the
door
i
went
out
into
the
anteroom
and
from
the
anteroom
into
the
courtyard
lukyánitch
escorted
me
muttering
sir
and
went
off
to
his
own
wing
but
who
was
the
lady
visitor
at
your
house
last
night
i
called
after
him
i
met
her
this
morning
in
the
grove
i
had
hoped
to
daze
him
with
my
sudden
question
to
evoke
a
thoughtless
answer
but
the
old
man
merely
laughed
dully
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him
when
he
went
in
i
retraced
my
steps
to
glínnoe
i
felt
awkward
like
a
boy
who
has
been
put
to
shame
no
i
said
to
myself
evidently
i
shall
not
obtain
a
solution
to
this
puzzle
i
give
it
up
i
will
think
no
more
of
all
this
an
hour
later
i
set
out
on
my
homeward
drive
enraged
and
irritated
a
week
elapsed
try
as
i
might
to
banish
from
me
the
memory
of
the
unknown
of
her
companion
of
my
meetings
with
them
it
kept
constantly
returning
and
besieged
me
with
all
the
importunate
persistence
of
an
fly
lukyánitch
with
his
mysterious
looks
and
reserved
speeches
with
his
smile
also
recurred
incessantly
to
my
memory
the
house
itself
when
i
thought
of
it
that
house
itself
gazed
at
me
cunningly
and
stupidly
through
its
shutters
and
seemed
to
be
jeering
at
me
as
though
it
were
saying
to
me
and
all
the
same
thou
shalt
not
find
out
anything
at
last
i
could
endure
it
no
longer
and
one
fine
day
i
drove
to
glínnoe
and
from
glínnoe
set
out
on
foot
whither
the
reader
can
easily
divine
i
must
confess
that
as
i
approached
the
mysterious
manor
i
felt
a
decidedly
violent
agitation
the
exterior
of
the
house
had
not
undergone
the
slightest
change
the
same
closed
windows
the
same
melancholy
and
desolate
aspect
only
on
the
bench
in
front
of
the
wing
instead
of
old
lukyánitch
sat
some
young
or
other
of
twenty
in
a
long
nankeen
kaftan
and
a
red
shirt
he
was
sitting
with
his
curly
head
resting
on
his
palm
and
dozing
swaying
to
and
fro
from
time
to
time
and
quivering
good
morning
brother
i
said
in
a
loud
voice
he
immediately
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stared
at
me
with
eyes
good
morning
brother
i
repeated
and
where
is
the
old
man
what
old
man
said
the
young
fellow
slowly
lukyánitch
ah
lukyánitch
he
darted
a
glance
do
you
want
lukyánitch
yes
i
do
is
he
at
home
enunciated
the
young
fellow
brokenly
he
you
know
how
shall
i
tell
you
about
that
is
he
ill
no
what
then
why
he
is
here
at
all
why
not
because
something
unpleasant
happened
to
him
is
he
dead
i
inquired
with
surprise
he
strangled
himself
strangled
himself
i
exclaimed
in
affright
and
clasped
my
hands
we
both
gazed
in
each
other
eyes
in
silence
how
long
ago
i
said
at
last
why
is
the
fifth
day
since
they
buried
him
yesterday
but
why
did
he
strangle
himself
the
lord
knows
he
was
a
freeman
on
wages
he
did
not
know
want
the
masters
petted
him
as
though
he
were
a
relation
for
we
have
such
good
masters
may
god
give
them
health
i
simply
ca
understand
what
came
over
him
evidently
the
evil
one
entrapped
him
but
how
did
he
do
it
why
so
he
took
and
strangled
himself
and
nothing
of
the
sort
had
been
previously
noticed
in
him
how
shall
i
tell
you
there
was
nothing
particular
he
was
always
a
very
melancholy
man
he
used
to
groan
and
groan
so
bored
he
would
say
well
and
then
there
was
his
age
of
late
he
really
did
begin
to
meditate
something
he
used
to
come
to
us
in
the
village
for
i
his
vásya
my
lad
he
would
say
brother
come
and
spend
the
night
with
me
for
uncle
because
i
frightened
somehow
is
tiresome
alone
well
and
so
i
go
to
him
he
would
come
out
into
the
courtyard
and
stare
and
stare
so
at
the
house
and
shake
and
shake
his
head
and
how
he
would
sigh
just
before
that
night
that
is
to
say
the
one
on
which
he
put
an
end
to
his
life
he
came
to
us
again
and
invited
me
well
and
so
i
went
when
we
reached
his
wing
he
sat
for
a
while
on
the
bench
then
he
rose
and
went
out
i
wait
and
rather
long
in
coming
back
says
i
and
went
out
into
the
courtyard
and
shouted
hey
uncle
my
uncle
did
not
call
back
thinks
i
can
he
have
gone
surely
not
into
the
house
and
i
went
into
the
house
twilight
was
already
drawing
on
and
as
i
was
passing
the
i
heard
something
scratching
there
behind
the
door
so
i
took
and
opened
the
door
behold
there
he
sat
doubled
up
under
the
window
art
thou
doing
there
uncle
says
i
but
he
turns
round
and
how
he
shouts
at
me
and
his
eyes
are
so
keen
so
keen
they
fairly
blaze
like
a
cat
dost
thou
want
dost
not
see
i
am
shaving
myself
and
his
voice
was
so
hoarse
my
hair
suddenly
rose
upright
and
i
do
know
why
i
got
frightened
evidently
about
that
time
the
devils
had
already
assailed
him
in
the
dark
says
i
and
my
knees
fairly
shook
says
he
all
right
begone
i
went
and
he
came
out
of
the
and
locked
the
door
so
we
went
back
to
the
wing
and
the
terror
immediately
left
me
wast
thou
doing
in
the
uncle
says
he
was
fairly
frightened
thy
tongue
says
he
thy
tongue
and
he
crawled
up
on
the
thinks
i
to
myself
will
be
better
for
me
not
to
speak
to
him
he
surely
must
be
feeling
ill
so
i
went
and
lay
down
on
the
myself
too
and
a
was
burning
in
a
corner
so
i
am
lying
there
and
just
dozing
you
know
when
suddenly
i
hear
the
door
creaking
softly
and
it
opens
so
a
little
and
my
uncle
was
lying
with
his
back
to
the
door
and
as
you
may
remember
he
was
always
a
little
hard
of
hearing
but
this
time
he
sprang
up
suddenly
calling
me
hey
who
is
it
hast
come
for
me
for
me
and
out
he
ran
into
the
yard
without
his
hat
i
thought
the
matter
with
him
and
sinful
man
that
i
am
i
fell
asleep
immediately
the
next
morning
i
woke
up
and
lukyánitch
was
not
there
i
went
out
of
doors
and
began
to
call
him
he
was
nowhere
i
asked
the
watchman
my
uncle
come
out
says
i
says
he
have
seen
something
happened
to
him
brother
says
i
we
were
both
fairly
frightened
feodósyeitch
says
i
on
says
i
see
whether
he
is
in
the
house
on
says
he
timofyéitch
but
he
himself
was
as
white
as
clay
we
entered
the
house
i
was
about
to
pass
the
but
i
glanced
and
the
padlock
was
hanging
open
on
the
hasp
and
i
pushed
the
door
but
the
door
was
fastened
inside
feodósyeitch
immediately
ran
round
and
peeped
in
at
the
window
timofyéitch
he
cries
legs
are
hanging
his
legs
i
ran
to
the
window
and
they
were
his
legs
lukyánitch
legs
and
he
had
hanged
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
well
we
sent
for
the
judge
they
took
him
down
from
the
rope
the
rope
was
tied
with
twelve
knots
well
what
did
the
court
say
what
did
the
court
say
nothing
they
pondered
and
pondered
what
the
cause
might
be
there
was
no
cause
and
so
they
decided
that
he
must
have
been
out
of
his
mind
his
head
had
been
aching
of
late
he
had
been
complaining
very
frequently
of
his
head
i
chatted
for
about
half
an
hour
longer
with
the
young
fellow
and
went
away
at
last
completely
disconcerted
i
must
confess
that
i
could
not
look
at
that
rickety
house
without
a
secret
superstitious
terror
a
month
later
i
quitted
my
and
little
by
little
all
these
horrors
these
mysterious
encounters
vanished
from
my
mind
ii
three
years
passed
the
greater
part
of
that
time
i
spent
in
petersburg
and
abroad
and
even
when
i
did
run
down
to
my
place
in
the
country
it
was
only
for
a
few
days
at
a
time
so
that
i
never
chanced
to
be
in
glínnoe
or
in
mikhaílovskoe
on
a
single
occasion
nowhere
had
i
seen
my
beauty
nor
the
man
one
day
toward
the
end
of
the
third
year
in
moscow
i
chanced
to
meet
madame
shlýkoff
and
her
sister
pelagéya
badáeff
that
same
pelagéya
whom
i
sinful
man
that
i
am
had
hitherto
regarded
as
a
mythical
being
at
an
evening
gathering
in
the
house
of
one
of
my
acquaintances
neither
of
the
ladies
was
any
longer
young
and
both
possessed
pleasing
exteriors
their
conversation
was
characterised
by
wit
and
mirth
they
had
travelled
a
great
deal
and
travelled
with
profit
easy
gaiety
was
observable
in
their
manners
but
they
and
my
acquaintance
had
positively
nothing
in
common
i
was
presented
to
them
madame
shlýkoff
and
i
dropped
into
conversation
her
sister
was
being
entertained
by
a
passing
geologist
i
informed
her
that
i
had
the
pleasure
of
being
her
neighbour
in
county
ah
i
really
do
possess
a
small
estate
there
she
remarked
near
glínnoe
exactly
exactly
i
returned
i
know
your
mikhaílovskoe
do
you
ever
go
thither
i
rarely
were
you
there
three
years
ago
stay
i
think
i
was
yes
i
was
that
is
true
with
your
sister
or
alone
she
darted
a
glance
at
me
with
my
sister
we
spent
about
a
week
there
on
business
you
know
however
we
saw
no
one
h
i
think
there
are
very
few
neighbours
there
yes
very
few
i
not
fond
of
neighbours
tell
me
i
began
i
believe
you
had
a
catastrophe
there
that
same
year
lukyánitch
madame
shlýkoff
eyes
immediately
filled
with
tears
and
did
you
know
him
she
said
with
such
a
misfortune
he
was
a
very
fine
good
old
man
and
just
fancy
without
any
cause
you
know
madame
shlýkoff
sister
approached
us
she
was
in
all
probability
beginning
to
be
bored
by
the
learned
disquisitions
of
the
geologist
about
the
formation
of
the
banks
of
the
volga
just
fancy
pauline
began
my
companion
monsieur
knew
lukyánitch
really
poor
old
man
i
hunted
more
than
once
in
the
environs
of
mikhaílovskoe
at
that
period
when
you
were
there
three
years
ago
i
remarked
i
returned
pelagéya
in
some
astonishment
well
yes
of
course
hastily
interposed
her
sister
is
it
possible
that
thou
dost
not
recall
it
and
she
looked
her
intently
in
the
eye
akh
yes
yes
that
is
true
replied
pelagéya
suddenly
ehe
he
i
thought
i
do
believe
you
were
in
mikhaílovskoe
my
dear
will
not
you
sing
us
something
pelagéya
feódorovna
suddenly
began
a
tall
young
man
with
a
crest
of
fair
hair
and
little
eyes
really
i
do
know
said
miss
badáeff
and
do
you
sing
i
exclaimed
with
vivacity
springing
up
briskly
from
my
seat
for
heaven
sake
akh
for
heaven
sake
do
sing
us
something
but
what
shall
i
sing
to
you
do
you
know
i
began
using
my
utmost
endeavours
to
impart
to
my
face
an
indifferent
and
easy
expression
an
italian
song
it
begins
this
way
quei
yes
replied
pelagéya
with
perfect
innocence
do
you
want
me
to
sing
that
very
well
and
she
seated
herself
at
the
piano
i
like
hamlet
riveted
my
eyes
on
madame
shlýkoff
it
seemed
to
me
that
at
the
first
note
she
gave
a
slight
start
but
she
sat
quietly
to
the
end
miss
badáeff
sang
quite
well
the
song
ended
the
customary
plaudits
resounded
they
began
to
urge
her
to
sing
something
else
but
the
two
sisters
exchanged
glances
and
a
few
minutes
later
they
took
their
departure
as
they
left
the
room
i
overheard
the
word
i
deserved
it
i
thought
and
did
not
meet
them
again
still
another
year
elapsed
i
transferred
my
residence
to
petersburg
winter
arrived
the
masquerades
began
one
day
as
i
emerged
at
eleven
at
night
from
the
house
of
a
friend
i
felt
myself
in
such
a
gloomy
frame
of
mind
that
i
decided
to
betake
myself
to
the
masquerade
in
the
assembly
of
the
nobility
for
a
long
time
i
roamed
about
among
the
columns
and
past
the
mirrors
with
a
expression
on
my
countenance
with
that
expression
which
so
far
as
i
have
observed
makes
its
appearance
in
such
cases
on
the
faces
of
the
most
persons
why
the
lord
only
knows
for
a
long
time
i
roamed
about
now
and
then
parrying
with
a
jest
the
advances
of
divers
shrill
dominoes
with
suspicious
lace
and
soiled
gloves
and
still
more
rarely
addressing
them
for
a
long
time
i
surrendered
my
ears
to
the
blare
of
the
trumpets
and
the
whining
of
the
violins
at
last
being
pretty
well
bored
i
was
on
the
point
of
going
home
and
and
remained
i
caught
sight
of
a
woman
in
a
black
domino
leaning
against
a
column
and
no
sooner
had
i
caught
sight
of
her
than
i
stopped
short
stepped
up
to
her
and
will
the
reader
believe
me
immediately
recognised
in
her
my
unknown
how
i
recognised
her
whether
by
the
glance
which
she
abstractedly
cast
upon
me
through
the
oblong
aperture
in
her
mask
or
by
the
wonderful
outlines
of
her
shoulders
and
arms
or
by
the
peculiarly
feminine
stateliness
of
her
whole
form
or
in
conclusion
by
some
secret
voice
which
suddenly
spoke
in
me
i
can
not
say
only
recognise
her
i
did
with
a
quiver
in
my
heart
i
walked
past
her
several
times
she
did
not
stir
in
her
attitude
there
was
something
so
hopelessly
sorrowful
that
as
i
gazed
at
her
i
involuntarily
recalled
two
lines
of
a
spanish
romance
soy
un
cuadro
de
tristeza
arrimado
a
la
pared
i
stepped
behind
the
column
against
which
she
was
leaning
and
bending
my
head
down
to
her
very
ear
enunciated
softly
quei
she
began
to
tremble
all
over
and
turned
swiftly
round
to
me
our
eyes
met
at
very
short
range
and
i
was
able
to
observe
how
fright
had
dilated
her
pupils
feebly
extending
one
hand
in
perplexity
she
gazed
at
me
on
may
in
sorrento
at
ten
in
the
evening
in
della
croce
street
i
said
in
a
deliberate
voice
without
taking
my
eyes
from
her
afterward
in
russia
in
the
government
in
the
hamlet
of
mikhaílovskoe
on
june
i
said
all
this
in
french
she
recoiled
a
little
scanned
me
from
head
to
foot
with
a
look
of
amazement
and
whispering
swiftly
left
the
room
i
followed
her
we
walked
on
in
silence
it
is
beyond
my
power
to
express
what
i
felt
as
i
walked
side
by
side
with
her
it
was
as
though
a
very
beautiful
dream
had
suddenly
become
reality
as
though
the
statue
of
galatea
had
descended
as
a
living
woman
from
its
pedestal
in
the
sight
of
the
swooning
pygmalion
i
could
not
believe
it
i
could
hardly
breathe
we
traversed
several
rooms
at
last
in
one
of
them
she
paused
in
front
of
a
small
divan
near
the
window
and
seated
herself
i
sat
down
beside
her
she
slowly
turned
her
head
toward
me
and
looked
intently
at
me
do
you
do
you
come
from
she
said
her
voice
was
weak
and
unsteady
her
question
somewhat
disconcerted
me
no
not
from
him
i
replied
haltingly
do
you
know
him
yes
i
replied
with
mysterious
solemnity
i
wanted
to
keep
up
my
yes
i
know
him
she
looked
distrustfully
at
me
started
to
say
something
and
dropped
her
eyes
you
were
waiting
for
him
in
sorrento
i
went
on
you
met
him
at
mikhaílovskoe
you
rode
on
horseback
with
him
how
could
you
she
began
i
know
i
know
all
your
face
seems
familiar
to
me
somehow
she
continued
but
no
no
i
am
a
stranger
to
you
then
what
is
it
that
you
want
i
know
that
also
i
persisted
i
understood
very
well
that
i
must
take
advantage
of
the
excellent
beginning
to
go
further
that
my
repetitions
of
i
know
all
i
know
were
becoming
ridiculous
but
my
agitation
was
so
great
that
unexpected
meeting
had
thrown
me
into
such
confusion
i
had
lost
my
to
such
a
degree
that
i
positively
was
unable
to
say
anything
else
moreover
i
really
knew
nothing
more
i
felt
conscious
that
i
was
talking
nonsense
felt
conscious
that
from
the
mysterious
omniscient
being
which
i
must
at
first
appear
to
her
to
be
i
should
soon
be
converted
into
a
sort
of
grinning
fool
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
yes
i
know
all
i
muttered
once
more
she
darted
a
glance
at
me
rose
quickly
to
her
feet
and
was
on
the
point
of
departing
but
this
was
too
cruel
i
seized
her
hand
for
god
sake
i
began
sit
down
listen
to
me
she
reflected
and
seated
herself
i
just
told
you
i
went
on
fervently
that
i
knew
everything
that
is
nonsense
i
know
nothing
i
do
not
know
either
who
you
are
or
who
he
is
and
if
i
have
been
able
to
surprise
you
by
what
i
said
to
you
a
while
ago
by
the
column
you
must
ascribe
that
to
chance
alone
to
a
strange
incomprehensible
chance
which
as
though
in
derision
has
brought
me
in
contact
with
you
twice
and
almost
in
identically
the
same
way
on
both
occasions
and
has
made
me
the
involuntary
witness
of
that
which
perhaps
you
would
like
to
keep
secret
and
thereupon
without
the
slightest
circumlocution
i
related
to
her
everything
my
meetings
with
her
in
sorrento
in
russia
my
futile
inquiries
in
mikhaílovskoe
even
my
conversation
in
moscow
with
madame
shlýkoff
and
her
sister
now
you
know
everything
i
went
on
when
i
had
finished
my
i
will
not
undertake
to
describe
to
you
what
an
overwhelming
impression
you
made
on
me
to
see
you
and
not
to
be
bewitched
by
you
is
impossible
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
tell
you
what
the
nature
of
that
impression
was
remember
under
what
conditions
i
beheld
you
both
times
believe
me
i
am
not
fond
of
indulging
in
senseless
hopes
but
you
must
understand
also
that
inexpressible
agitation
which
has
seized
upon
me
and
you
must
pardon
the
awkward
artifice
to
which
i
decided
to
have
recourse
in
order
to
attract
your
attention
if
only
for
a
moment
she
listened
to
my
confused
explanations
without
raising
her
head
what
do
you
want
of
me
she
said
at
last
i
i
want
nothing
i
am
happy
as
i
am
i
have
too
much
respect
for
such
secrets
really
but
up
to
this
point
apparently
however
she
went
on
i
will
not
reproach
you
any
man
would
have
done
the
same
in
your
place
moreover
chance
really
has
brought
us
together
so
persistently
that
would
seem
to
give
you
a
certain
right
to
frankness
on
my
part
listen
i
am
not
one
of
those
uncomprehended
and
unhappy
women
who
go
to
masquerades
for
the
sake
of
chattering
to
the
first
man
they
meet
about
their
sufferings
who
require
hearts
filled
with
sympathy
i
require
sympathy
from
no
one
my
own
heart
is
dead
and
i
have
come
hither
in
order
to
bury
it
definitively
she
raised
a
handkerchief
to
her
lips
i
hope
she
went
on
with
a
certain
amount
of
effort
that
you
do
not
take
my
words
for
the
ordinary
effusions
of
a
masquerade
you
must
understand
that
i
am
in
no
mood
for
that
and
in
truth
there
was
something
terrible
in
her
voice
despite
all
the
softness
of
its
tones
i
am
a
russian
she
said
in
russian
up
to
that
point
she
had
expressed
herself
in
the
french
language
although
i
have
lived
little
in
russia
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
know
your
name
anna
feódorovna
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
i
really
did
go
to
mikhaílovskoe
under
the
name
of
her
sister
it
was
impossible
at
that
time
for
me
to
meet
him
openly
and
even
without
that
rumours
had
begun
to
circulate
at
that
time
obstacles
still
existed
he
was
not
free
those
obstacles
have
disappeared
but
he
whose
name
should
become
mine
he
with
whom
you
saw
me
has
abandoned
me
she
made
a
gesture
with
her
hand
and
paused
awhile
you
really
do
not
know
him
you
have
not
met
him
not
once
he
has
spent
almost
all
this
time
abroad
but
he
is
here
now
that
is
my
whole
history
she
added
you
see
there
is
nothing
mysterious
about
it
nothing
peculiar
and
sorrento
i
timidly
interposed
i
made
his
acquaintance
in
sorrento
she
answered
slowly
becoming
pensive
both
of
us
held
our
peace
a
strange
discomposure
took
possession
of
me
i
was
sitting
beside
her
beside
that
woman
whose
image
had
so
often
flitted
through
my
dreams
had
so
torturingly
agitated
and
irritated
me
i
was
sitting
beside
her
and
felt
a
cold
and
a
weight
at
my
heart
i
knew
that
nothing
would
come
of
that
meeting
that
between
her
and
me
there
was
a
gulf
that
when
we
parted
we
should
part
forever
with
her
head
bowed
forward
and
both
hands
lying
in
her
lap
she
sat
there
indifferent
and
careless
i
know
that
carelessness
of
incurable
grief
i
know
that
indifference
of
irrecoverable
happiness
the
masks
strolled
past
us
in
couples
the
sounds
of
the
monotonous
and
senseless
waltz
now
reverberated
dully
in
the
distance
now
were
wafted
by
in
sharp
gusts
the
merry
agitated
me
heavily
and
mournfully
can
it
be
i
thought
that
this
woman
is
the
same
who
appeared
to
me
once
on
a
time
in
the
window
of
that
little
country
house
far
away
in
all
the
splendour
of
triumphant
beauty
and
yet
time
seemed
not
to
have
touched
her
the
lower
part
of
her
face
unconcealed
by
the
lace
of
her
mask
was
of
almost
childish
delicacy
but
a
chill
emanated
from
her
as
from
a
statue
galatea
had
returned
to
her
pedestal
and
would
descend
from
it
no
more
suddenly
she
drew
herself
up
darted
a
glance
into
the
next
room
and
rose
give
me
your
arm
she
said
to
me
let
us
go
away
quickly
quickly
we
returned
to
the
she
walked
so
fast
that
i
could
barely
keep
up
with
her
she
came
to
a
standstill
beside
one
of
the
columns
let
us
wait
here
she
whispered
are
you
looking
for
any
one
i
began
but
she
paid
no
heed
to
me
her
eager
gaze
was
fixed
upon
the
crowd
languidly
and
menacingly
did
her
great
black
eyes
look
forth
from
beneath
the
black
velvet
i
turned
in
the
direction
of
her
gaze
and
understood
everything
along
the
corridor
formed
by
the
row
of
columns
and
the
wall
he
was
walking
that
man
whom
i
had
met
with
her
in
the
forest
i
recognised
him
instantly
he
had
hardly
changed
at
all
his
moustache
curled
as
handsomely
as
ever
his
brown
eyes
beamed
with
the
same
calm
and
cheerfulness
as
of
yore
he
was
walking
without
haste
and
lightly
bending
his
slender
figure
was
narrating
something
to
a
woman
in
a
domino
whose
arm
was
linked
in
his
as
he
came
on
a
level
with
us
he
suddenly
raised
his
head
looked
first
at
me
then
at
the
woman
with
whom
i
was
standing
and
probably
recognised
her
eyes
for
his
eyebrows
quivered
slightly
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
a
barely
perceptible
but
intolerably
insolent
smile
hovered
over
his
lips
he
bent
down
to
his
companion
and
whispered
a
couple
of
words
in
her
ear
she
immediately
glanced
round
her
blue
eyes
hastily
scanned
us
both
and
with
a
soft
laugh
she
menaced
him
with
her
little
hand
he
slightly
shrugged
one
shoulder
she
nestled
up
to
him
coquettishly
i
turned
to
my
unknown
she
was
gazing
after
the
receding
pair
and
suddenly
tearing
her
arm
from
mine
she
rushed
toward
the
door
i
was
about
to
dash
after
her
but
turning
round
she
gave
me
such
a
look
that
i
made
her
a
profound
bow
and
remained
where
i
was
i
understood
that
to
pursue
her
would
be
both
rude
and
stupid
tell
me
please
my
dear
fellow
i
said
half
an
hour
later
to
one
of
my
friends
the
living
directory
of
petersburg
who
is
that
tall
handsome
gentleman
with
a
moustache
that
that
is
some
foreigner
or
other
a
rather
enigmatic
individual
who
very
rarely
makes
his
appearance
on
our
horizon
why
do
you
ask
oh
because
i
returned
home
since
that
time
i
have
never
met
my
unknown
anywhere
had
i
known
the
name
of
the
man
whom
she
loved
i
might
probably
have
found
out
eventually
who
she
was
but
i
myself
did
not
desire
that
i
have
said
above
that
that
woman
appeared
to
me
like
a
and
like
a
she
went
past
and
vanished
forever
footnotes
pass
through
these
hills
and
come
cheerily
to
me
care
thou
not
for
too
great
a
company
come
thou
and
think
secretly
of
me
that
i
may
be
thy
comrade
all
the
way
in
central
and
southern
russia
where
timber
is
scarce
fences
and
even
the
walls
of
barns
and
are
made
of
interlaced
translator
the
nobles
translator
i
am
a
picture
of
sorrow
leaning
against
the
wall
mumú
in
one
of
the
remote
streets
of
moscow
in
a
grey
house
with
white
pillars
an
entresol
and
a
crooked
balcony
dwelt
in
former
days
a
lady
a
widow
surrounded
by
numerous
domestics
her
sons
were
in
the
service
in
petersburg
her
daughters
were
married
she
rarely
went
out
into
society
and
was
living
out
the
last
years
of
a
miserly
and
tedious
old
age
in
solitude
her
day
cheerless
and
stormy
was
long
since
over
but
her
evening
also
was
blacker
than
night
among
the
ranks
of
her
menials
the
most
remarkable
person
was
the
gerásim
a
man
six
feet
five
inches
in
height
built
like
an
epic
hero
and
a
from
his
birth
his
mistress
had
taken
him
from
the
village
where
he
lived
alone
in
a
tiny
cottage
apart
from
his
brethren
and
was
considered
the
most
punctual
of
the
taxable
serfs
endowed
with
remarkable
strength
he
did
the
work
of
four
persons
matters
made
progress
in
his
hands
and
it
was
a
cheerful
sight
to
watch
him
when
he
ploughed
and
applying
his
huge
hands
to
the
primitive
plough
seemed
to
be
carving
open
the
elastic
bosom
of
the
earth
alone
without
the
aid
of
his
little
nag
or
about
peter
day
wielding
the
scythe
so
shatteringly
that
he
might
even
have
hewn
off
a
young
from
its
roots
or
threshing
briskly
and
unremittingly
with
a
chain
seven
feet
in
length
while
the
firm
oblong
muscles
on
his
shoulders
rose
and
fell
like
levers
his
uninterrupted
muteness
imparted
to
his
indefatigable
labour
a
grave
solemnity
he
was
a
splendid
peasant
and
had
it
not
been
for
his
infirmity
any
maiden
would
willingly
have
married
him
but
gerásim
was
brought
to
moscow
boots
were
bought
for
him
a
broom
and
a
shovel
were
put
into
his
hand
and
he
was
appointed
to
be
the
at
first
he
felt
a
violent
dislike
for
his
new
life
from
his
childhood
he
had
been
accustomed
to
to
country
life
set
apart
by
his
infirmity
from
communion
with
his
he
had
grown
up
dumb
and
mighty
as
a
tree
grows
on
fruitful
soil
transported
to
the
town
he
did
not
understand
what
was
happening
to
him
he
felt
bored
and
puzzled
as
a
healthy
young
bull
is
puzzled
when
he
has
just
been
taken
from
the
pasture
where
the
grass
grew
up
to
his
belly
when
he
has
been
taken
and
placed
in
a
and
lo
with
his
robust
body
enveloped
now
with
smoke
and
sparks
again
with
billows
of
steam
he
is
drawn
headlong
onward
drawn
with
rumble
and
squeaking
and
whither
god
only
knows
gerásim
occupations
in
his
new
employment
seemed
to
him
a
mere
farce
after
his
onerous
labours
as
a
peasant
in
half
an
hour
he
had
finished
everything
and
he
was
again
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
and
staring
at
all
the
as
though
desirous
of
obtaining
from
them
the
solution
of
his
enigmatic
situation
or
he
would
suddenly
go
off
to
some
corner
and
flinging
his
broom
or
his
shovel
far
from
him
would
throw
himself
on
the
ground
face
downward
and
lie
motionless
on
his
breast
for
whole
hours
at
a
time
like
a
captured
wild
beast
but
man
grows
accustomed
to
everything
and
gerásim
got
used
at
last
to
town
life
he
had
not
much
to
do
his
entire
duty
consisted
in
keeping
the
courtyard
clean
fetching
a
cask
of
water
twice
a
day
hauling
and
chopping
up
wood
for
the
kitchen
and
house
and
in
not
admitting
strangers
and
keeping
watch
at
night
and
it
must
be
said
that
he
discharged
his
duty
with
zeal
not
a
chip
was
ever
strewn
about
his
courtyard
nor
any
dirt
if
in
muddy
weather
the
nag
for
hauling
water
and
the
barrel
entrusted
to
his
care
got
stranded
anywhere
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
apply
his
shoulder
and
not
only
the
cart
but
the
horse
also
would
be
pried
from
the
spot
if
he
undertook
to
chop
wood
his
axe
would
ring
like
glass
and
splinters
and
billets
would
fly
in
every
direction
and
as
for
strangers
after
he
had
one
night
caught
two
thieves
and
had
banged
their
heads
together
and
mauled
them
so
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
taking
them
to
the
afterward
every
one
in
the
neighbourhood
began
to
respect
him
greatly
and
even
by
day
who
were
not
in
the
least
rascals
but
simply
strangers
to
him
at
the
sight
of
the
ominous
would
brandish
their
arms
as
though
in
and
shout
at
him
as
though
he
were
able
to
hear
their
cries
with
all
the
other
domestics
gerásim
sustained
relations
which
were
not
exactly
friendly
they
were
afraid
of
him
but
gentle
he
regarded
them
as
members
of
the
family
they
expressed
their
meaning
to
him
by
signs
and
he
understood
them
accurately
executed
all
orders
but
knew
his
own
rights
also
and
no
one
dared
to
take
his
seat
at
table
on
the
whole
gerásim
was
of
stern
and
serious
disposition
and
was
fond
of
orderliness
in
all
things
even
the
cocks
did
not
venture
to
fight
in
his
presence
but
if
they
did
woe
be
to
them
if
he
caught
sight
of
them
he
would
instantly
seize
them
by
the
legs
whirl
them
round
like
a
wheel
half
a
score
of
times
in
the
air
and
hurl
them
in
opposite
directions
there
were
geese
also
in
his
lady
mistress
courtyard
but
a
goose
as
every
one
knows
is
a
serious
and
sensible
bird
gerásim
felt
respect
for
them
tended
them
and
fed
them
he
himself
bore
a
resemblance
to
a
stately
gander
he
was
allotted
a
tiny
chamber
over
the
kitchen
he
arranged
it
himself
after
his
own
taste
constructed
a
bed
of
oaken
planks
on
four
blocks
truly
a
bed
fit
for
an
epic
hero
a
hundred
puds
might
have
been
loaded
upon
it
it
would
not
have
given
way
under
the
bed
was
a
stout
chest
in
one
corner
stood
a
small
table
of
the
same
sturdy
quality
and
beside
the
table
a
chair
and
so
firm
and
squatty
that
gerásim
himself
would
pick
it
up
drop
it
and
grin
this
little
den
was
fastened
with
a
padlock
which
suggested
a
in
shape
only
black
gerásim
always
carried
the
key
to
this
lock
with
him
in
his
belt
he
was
not
fond
of
having
people
come
into
his
room
in
this
manner
a
year
passed
at
the
end
of
which
a
small
incident
happened
to
gerásim
the
old
gentlewoman
with
whom
he
lived
as
in
all
things
followed
the
ancient
customs
and
kept
a
numerous
train
of
domestics
she
had
in
her
house
not
only
laundresses
seamstresses
carpenters
tailors
and
dressmakers
but
also
one
saddler
who
set
up
to
be
a
veterinary
and
a
medical
man
for
the
servants
as
well
there
was
a
for
the
mistress
and
in
conclusion
there
was
a
shoemaker
by
the
name
of
kapíton
klímoff
a
bitter
drunkard
klímoff
regarded
himself
as
an
injured
being
and
not
appreciated
at
his
true
value
a
cultured
man
used
to
the
ways
of
the
capital
who
ought
not
to
live
in
moscow
without
occupation
in
a
sort
of
desert
spot
and
if
he
drank
as
he
himself
expressed
it
with
pauses
between
his
words
and
thumping
himself
on
the
breast
he
drank
in
reality
from
grief
one
day
he
was
under
discussion
by
the
mistress
and
her
head
butler
gavríla
a
man
who
would
seem
from
his
little
yellow
eyes
and
his
nose
to
have
been
designated
by
fate
itself
as
a
commanding
personage
the
mistress
was
complaining
about
the
depraved
morals
of
kapíton
who
had
been
picked
up
somewhere
in
the
street
only
the
night
before
well
gavríla
she
suddenly
remarked
shall
not
we
marry
him
what
dost
thou
think
about
it
perhaps
that
will
steady
him
why
should
we
marry
him
it
can
be
done
replied
gavríla
and
it
would
even
be
a
very
good
thing
yes
only
who
would
marry
him
of
course
however
as
you
like
he
can
always
be
put
to
some
use
so
to
speak
you
would
reject
him
out
of
any
ten
men
i
think
he
likes
tatyána
gavríla
was
about
to
make
some
reply
but
compressed
his
lips
yes
let
him
woo
tatyána
the
mistress
announced
her
decision
as
she
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
with
satisfaction
dost
hear
me
i
obey
enunciated
gavríla
and
withdrew
on
returning
to
his
chamber
it
was
situated
in
a
wing
and
was
almost
completely
filled
with
coffers
gavríla
first
sent
away
his
wife
and
then
seated
himself
by
the
window
and
became
engrossed
in
meditation
the
mistress
sudden
command
had
evidently
dazed
him
at
last
he
rose
and
ordered
kapíton
to
be
called
kapíton
presented
himself
but
before
we
repeat
their
conversation
to
the
reader
we
consider
it
not
superfluous
to
state
in
a
few
words
who
this
tatyána
was
whom
kapíton
was
to
marry
and
why
his
mistress
command
had
disconcerted
the
tatyána
who
as
we
have
said
above
served
as
laundress
but
in
her
quality
of
expert
and
laundress
she
was
given
only
the
delicate
linen
was
a
woman
of
small
thin
with
moles
on
her
left
cheek
moles
on
the
left
cheek
are
regarded
as
a
bad
sign
in
russia
as
the
presage
of
an
unhappy
life
tatyána
could
not
boast
of
her
luck
from
early
youth
she
had
been
she
had
worked
for
two
and
had
never
received
any
caresses
she
was
badly
clothed
she
received
the
very
smallest
of
wages
she
had
practically
no
relatives
an
old
butler
in
the
village
who
had
been
discharged
for
uselessness
was
her
uncle
and
her
other
uncles
were
common
peasants
that
is
all
at
one
time
she
had
been
a
beauty
but
her
beauty
soon
left
her
she
was
of
extremely
meek
or
to
put
it
more
accurately
frightened
disposition
felt
the
most
complete
indifference
for
herself
and
was
deadly
afraid
of
other
people
her
sole
thought
was
as
to
how
she
might
finish
her
work
by
the
appointed
time
she
never
talked
with
any
one
and
she
trembled
at
the
mere
mention
of
the
mistress
name
although
she
hardly
knew
her
by
sight
when
gerásim
was
brought
from
the
country
she
almost
swooned
with
terror
at
the
sight
of
his
huge
form
used
all
possible
efforts
to
avoid
meeting
him
and
even
screwed
up
her
eyes
when
she
was
obliged
to
run
past
him
as
she
scurried
from
the
house
to
the
laundry
at
first
gerásim
paid
no
special
attention
to
her
then
he
began
to
laugh
when
she
crossed
his
path
then
he
began
to
gaze
at
her
with
pleasure
and
at
last
he
never
took
his
eyes
from
her
whether
he
had
taken
a
liking
to
her
because
of
her
gentle
expression
of
countenance
or
of
the
timidity
of
her
movements
god
knows
and
behold
one
day
as
she
was
making
her
way
across
the
courtyard
cautiously
elevating
on
her
outspread
fingers
a
starched
wrapper
belonging
to
her
mistress
some
one
suddenly
grasped
her
by
the
elbow
she
turned
round
and
fairly
screamed
aloud
behind
her
stood
gerásim
laughing
stupidly
and
bellowing
affectionately
he
was
offering
her
a
gingerbread
cock
with
gold
tinsel
on
its
tail
and
wings
she
tried
to
refuse
it
but
he
thrust
it
forcibly
straight
into
her
hand
nodded
his
head
walked
away
and
turning
round
bellowed
once
more
something
of
a
very
friendly
nature
to
her
from
that
day
forth
he
gave
her
no
peace
wherever
she
went
he
immediately
came
to
meet
her
smiled
bellowed
waved
his
hands
suddenly
drew
a
ribbon
from
his
breast
and
thrust
it
into
her
hand
and
cleaned
the
dust
away
in
front
of
her
with
his
broom
the
poor
girl
simply
did
not
know
how
to
take
it
or
what
to
do
the
whole
household
speedily
found
out
about
the
pranks
of
the
dumb
jeers
jests
stinging
remarks
showered
down
on
tatyána
but
none
of
them
could
bring
himself
to
ridicule
gerásim
the
latter
was
not
fond
of
jests
and
they
let
her
alone
in
his
presence
the
girl
became
his
protégée
like
all
deaf
and
dumb
people
he
was
very
perspicacious
and
understood
perfectly
well
when
they
were
laughing
at
him
or
at
her
one
day
at
dinner
the
keeper
of
the
linen
chief
undertook
as
the
saying
is
to
banter
her
and
carried
it
to
such
a
pitch
that
the
latter
poor
creature
did
not
know
where
to
look
and
almost
wept
with
vexation
gerásim
suddenly
rose
stretched
out
his
enormous
hand
laid
it
on
the
head
of
the
keeper
of
the
linen
and
glared
into
her
face
with
such
ferocity
that
the
latter
fairly
bent
over
the
table
all
fell
silent
gerásim
picked
up
his
spoon
again
and
went
on
eating
his
just
see
that
dumb
devil
that
forest
fiend
all
muttered
under
their
breaths
and
the
keeper
of
the
linen
rose
and
went
off
to
the
maids
room
on
another
occasion
observing
that
kapíton
that
same
kapíton
of
whom
we
have
just
been
speaking
was
chatting
in
rather
too
friendly
a
manner
with
tatyána
gerásim
beckoned
the
man
to
him
led
him
away
to
the
and
seizing
by
its
end
a
shaft
which
was
standing
in
the
corner
he
menaced
him
slightly
but
significantly
with
it
from
that
time
forth
no
one
dared
to
address
a
word
to
tatyána
and
all
this
ran
smoothly
in
his
hands
no
sooner
had
the
it
is
true
run
into
the
maids
hall
than
she
fell
down
in
a
swoon
and
altogether
behaved
in
such
an
artful
manner
that
on
that
very
same
day
she
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
mistress
gerásim
rude
behaviour
but
the
capricious
old
lady
merely
laughed
several
times
to
the
extreme
offence
of
her
made
her
repeat
what
didst
thou
say
did
he
bend
thee
down
with
his
heavy
hand
and
on
the
following
day
sent
a
silver
ruble
to
gerásim
she
favoured
him
as
a
faithful
and
powerful
watchman
gerásim
held
her
in
decided
awe
but
nevertheless
he
trusted
in
her
graciousness
and
was
making
ready
to
betake
himself
to
her
with
the
request
that
she
would
permit
him
to
marry
tatyána
he
was
only
waiting
for
the
new
kaftan
promised
him
by
the
in
order
that
he
might
present
himself
before
his
mistress
in
decent
shape
when
suddenly
this
same
mistress
took
into
her
head
the
idea
of
marrying
tatyána
to
kapíton
the
reader
will
now
be
able
readily
to
understand
the
cause
of
the
perturbation
which
seized
upon
gavríla
the
after
his
conversation
with
his
mistress
the
mistress
he
thought
as
he
sat
by
the
window
of
course
favours
gerásim
this
was
well
known
to
gavríla
and
therefore
he
also
showed
indulgence
to
him
still
he
is
a
dumb
brute
i
ca
inform
the
mistress
that
gerásim
is
courting
tatyána
and
after
all
is
just
what
sort
of
a
husband
is
he
and
on
the
other
hand
lord
forgive
for
just
as
soon
as
that
forest
fiend
finds
out
that
tatyána
is
to
be
married
to
kapíton
he
smash
everything
in
the
house
by
heaven
he
will
for
you
ca
reason
with
him
you
ca
prevail
upon
him
the
devil
that
he
is
in
any
way
whatsoever
sinful
man
that
i
am
to
have
said
so
wicked
a
thing
that
so
the
appearance
of
kapíton
broke
the
thread
of
gavríla
meditations
the
shoemaker
entered
threw
his
hands
behind
him
and
leaning
up
against
a
projecting
corner
of
the
wall
near
the
door
in
a
way
he
stuck
his
right
leg
crosswise
in
front
of
the
left
and
shook
his
head
as
much
as
to
say
here
i
am
what
your
will
gavríla
looked
at
kapíton
and
began
to
drum
on
the
jamb
of
the
window
with
his
fingers
kapíton
merely
narrowed
his
leaden
eyes
a
bit
but
did
not
lower
them
even
smiled
slightly
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
whitish
hair
which
stood
out
in
disarray
in
all
directions
as
much
as
to
say
well
yes
is
i
what
are
you
staring
for
good
said
gavríla
and
paused
for
a
space
thou
a
nice
one
remarked
gavríla
and
paused
a
nice
person
there
no
denying
that
kapíton
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
art
thou
any
better
pray
he
said
to
himself
come
now
just
look
at
thyself
come
look
went
on
gavríla
reprovingly
well
art
not
thou
ashamed
of
thyself
kapíton
surveyed
with
a
calm
glance
his
threadbare
and
tattered
coat
and
his
patched
trousers
scanned
with
particular
attention
his
shoes
perforated
with
holes
especially
the
one
on
whose
toe
his
right
foot
rested
in
so
dandified
a
manner
and
again
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
what
of
it
sir
what
of
it
sir
repeated
what
of
it
sir
and
thou
sayest
of
it
sir
to
boot
thou
lookest
like
the
devil
lord
forgive
me
sinful
man
that
i
am
that
what
thou
lookest
like
kapíton
winked
his
little
eyes
briskly
curse
away
curse
away
gavríla
andréitch
he
thought
to
himself
thou
hast
been
drunk
again
apparently
began
gavríla
drunk
again
surely
hey
come
answer
owing
to
the
feebleness
of
my
health
i
have
succumbed
to
spirituous
beverages
in
fact
returned
kapíton
owing
to
feebleness
of
health
thou
art
not
whipped
enough
that
what
and
thou
hast
served
thine
apprenticeship
in
peter
to
boot
much
thou
didst
learn
in
thine
apprenticeship
thou
dost
nothing
but
eat
the
bread
of
idleness
in
that
case
gavríla
andréitch
i
have
but
one
judge
the
lord
god
himself
and
no
one
else
he
alone
knows
what
sort
of
a
man
i
am
in
this
world
and
whether
i
really
do
eat
the
bread
of
idleness
and
as
for
thy
reflections
concerning
drunkenness
in
that
case
also
i
am
not
to
blame
but
rather
one
of
my
comrades
for
he
led
me
astray
and
after
he
had
accomplished
his
crafty
purpose
he
went
away
that
is
to
say
i
and
thou
didst
remain
behind
thou
goose
in
the
street
akh
thou
dissolute
man
well
but
that
not
the
point
went
on
the
but
this
the
mistress
here
he
paused
for
a
moment
it
is
the
mistress
pleasure
that
thou
shouldst
marry
hearest
thou
she
thinks
that
thou
wilt
grow
steady
when
thou
art
married
dost
understand
how
can
i
help
understanding
sir
well
yes
in
my
opinion
would
be
better
to
take
thee
firmly
in
hand
well
but
that
her
affair
how
now
dost
thou
consent
kapíton
displayed
his
teeth
in
a
grin
marriage
is
a
good
thing
for
a
man
gavríla
andréitch
and
i
on
my
part
agree
with
very
great
pleasure
well
yes
returned
gavríla
and
thought
to
himself
there
no
denying
it
the
man
talks
with
exactness
only
see
here
he
went
on
aloud
an
inconvenient
bride
has
been
picked
out
for
thee
who
is
she
permit
me
to
inquire
tatyána
tatyána
and
kapíton
eyes
fairly
popped
out
of
his
head
and
he
started
away
from
the
wall
well
what
art
thou
scared
at
is
she
to
thy
taste
to
my
taste
forsooth
gavríla
andréitch
the
girl

is
all
right

a
good
worker
a
meek
lass

spectre
of
the
steppes
is
courting

a
fly

the
hand

mínin
and
pozhársky
for
he

and
not

that
he
is
killing

his
huge
fists

possibility
of

him

gavríla

interrupted
him
impatiently
kapíton
turned
and
took
himself
off
and
supposing
there
were
no
question
of
him
shouted
the
after
him
dost

replied
kapíton
and
lurched
out
of
the
room
his
eloquence
did
not
abandon
him
even
in
extremities
the
paced
the
length
of
the
room
several
times

he
said
at
last
in
a
few
moments
tatyána
entered
almost
inaudibly
and
halted
on
the
threshold
what

she
said
in
a
quiet
voice

that
thou
really
art
an
obedient
girl
tatyána
turned
leaned
lightly
against
the
and
left
the
room
but
perhaps
the
mistress
will
have
forgotten
about
this
wedding
by
meditated
the
why
have
i
been
alarmed
we
pinion
that
insolent
fellow
if
he
makes
any
trouble
we
send
word
to
the
police
ustínya
feódorovna
he
shouted
in
a
loud
voice
to
his
wife
prepare
the
samovár
my
good
woman
all
that
day
tatyána
hardly
quitted
the
laundry
at
first
she
wept
then
she
wiped
away
her
tears
and
set
to
work
as
of
yore
kapíton
sat
until
the
dead
of
night
in
a
drinking
establishment
with
a
friend
of
gloomy
aspect
and
narrated
to
him
in
detail
how
he
had
lived
in
peter
with
a
certain
gentleman
who
had
everything
that
heart
could
desire
and
was
a
great
stickler
for
order
and
withal
permitted
himself
one
little
delinquency
he
was
wont
to
get
awfully
fuddled
and
as
for
the
feminine
sex
he
simply
had
all
the
qualities
to
attract
his
gloomy
comrade
merely
expressed
assent
but
when
kapíton
announced
at
last
that
owing
to
certain
circumstances
he
must
lay
violent
hands
upon
himself
on
the
morrow
the
gloomy
comrade
remarked
that
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
and
they
parted
churlishly
and
in
silence
in
the
meantime
the
expectations
were
not
realised
the
idea
of
kapíton
wedding
had
so
captivated
the
mistress
that
even
during
the
night
she
had
talked
of
nothing
else
with
one
of
her
companions
whom
she
kept
in
the
house
solely
in
case
of
sleeplessness
and
who
like
night
cabmen
slept
by
day
when
gavríla
entered
her
room
after
tea
with
his
report
her
first
question
was
and
how
about
our
wedding
he
replied
of
course
that
it
was
progressing
famously
and
that
kapíton
would
present
himself
to
her
that
same
day
to
thank
her
the
mistress
was
slightly
indisposed
she
did
not
occupy
herself
long
with
business
the
returned
to
his
own
room
and
called
a
council
the
matter
really
did
require
particular
consideration
tatyána
did
not
make
any
objection
of
course
but
kapíton
declared
in
the
hearing
of
all
that
he
had
but
one
head
and
not
two
or
three
heads
gerásim
gazed
surlily
and
swiftly
at
everybody
never
left
the
porch
and
apparently
divined
that
something
unpleasant
for
him
was
brewing
the
assembled
company
among
them
was
present
the
old
butler
nicknamed
uncle
tail
to
whom
all
respectfully
turned
for
advice
although
all
they
heard
from
him
was
yes
yes
yes
yes
began
by
way
of
precaution
for
safety
by
locking
kapíton
up
in
the
with
the
and
set
to
thinking
hard
of
course
it
was
easy
to
resort
to
force
but
god
forbid
there
would
be
a
row
the
mistress
would
get
uneasy
and
a
calamity
would
ensue
what
was
to
be
done
they
thought
and
thought
and
eventually
they
hit
upon
something
it
had
been
repeatedly
noticed
that
gerásim
could
not
abide
intoxicated
persons
as
he
sat
at
the
gate
he
turned
away
angrily
whenever
any
man
with
a
load
of
drink
aboard
passed
him
with
unsteady
steps
and
the
visor
of
his
cap
over
his
ear
they
decided
to
instruct
tatyána
to
pretend
to
be
intoxicated
and
to
walk
past
gerásim
reeling
and
staggering
the
poor
girl
would
not
consent
for
a
long
time
but
they
prevailed
upon
her
moreover
she
herself
saw
that
otherwise
she
would
not
be
able
to
get
rid
of
her
adorer
she
did
it
kapíton
was
released
from
the
the
affair
concerned
him
anyhow
gerásim
was
sitting
on
the
at
the
gate
and
jabbing
the
ground
with
his
shovel
there
were
people
staring
at
him
from
round
all
the
corners
from
behind
the
the
ruse
was
completely
successful
when
first
he
caught
sight
of
tatyána
he
nodded
his
head
with
an
affectionate
bellow
then
he
took
a
closer
look
dropped
his
shovel
sprang
to
his
feet
stepped
up
to
her
put
his
face
close
down
to
her
face
she
reeled
worse
than
ever
with
terror
and
closed
her
eyes
he
seized
her
by
the
arm
dashed
the
whole
length
of
the
courtyard
and
entering
the
room
where
the
council
was
in
session
with
her
he
thrust
her
straight
at
kapíton
tatyána
was
fairly
swooning
gerásim
stood
there
glared
at
her
waved
his
hand
laughed
and
departed
clumping
heavily
to
his
little
den
for
hours
he
did
not
emerge
thence
antípka
the
postilion
related
afterward
how
peeping
through
a
crack
he
had
beheld
gerásim
seated
on
his
bed
with
his
head
resting
on
his
hand
quietly
peaceably
and
only
bellowing
from
time
to
time
then
he
would
rock
himself
to
and
fro
cover
his
eyes
and
shake
his
head
as
postilions
or
stevedores
do
when
they
strike
up
their
melancholy
chanteys
antípka
was
frightened
and
he
retreated
from
the
crack
but
when
on
the
following
day
gerásim
emerged
from
his
den
no
particular
change
was
noticeable
in
him
he
merely
seemed
to
have
become
more
surly
and
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
tatyána
and
kapíton
on
that
same
evening
both
of
them
with
geese
under
their
arms
wended
their
way
to
the
mistress
and
a
week
later
they
were
married
on
the
itself
gerásim
did
not
alter
his
demeanour
in
the
slightest
degree
only
he
returned
from
the
river
without
water
somehow
he
had
smashed
the
cask
on
the
road
and
at
night
in
the
stable
he
so
zealously
curried
his
horse
that
the
animal
reeled
like
a
blade
of
grass
in
a
gale
and
shifted
from
foot
to
foot
under
his
iron
fists
all
this
took
place
in
the
spring
another
year
passed
in
the
course
of
which
kapíton
finally
became
a
drunkard
and
as
a
man
utterly
unfit
for
anything
was
despatched
with
the
train
of
to
a
distant
village
together
with
his
wife
on
the
day
of
departure
he
made
a
great
show
of
courage
at
first
and
declared
that
no
matter
where
they
might
send
him
even
to
the
place
where
the
wash
shirts
and
put
their
in
the
sky
he
would
not
come
to
grief
but
afterward
he
became
began
to
complain
that
he
was
being
taken
to
uncivilised
people
and
finally
weakened
to
such
a
degree
that
he
was
unable
even
to
put
his
own
cap
on
his
head
some
compassionate
soul
pulled
it
down
on
his
brow
adjusted
the
visor
and
banged
it
down
on
top
and
when
all
was
ready
and
the
peasants
were
already
holding
the
reins
in
their
hands
and
only
waiting
for
the
word
with
god
blessing
gerásim
emerged
from
his
tiny
chamber
approached
tatyána
and
presented
her
with
a
souvenir
consisting
of
a
red
cotton
kerchief
which
he
had
bought
expressly
for
her
a
year
before
tatyána
who
up
to
that
moment
had
borne
all
the
vicissitudes
of
her
life
with
great
equanimity
could
hold
out
no
longer
and
then
and
there
burst
into
tears
and
as
she
took
her
seat
in
the
cart
exchanged
three
kisses
with
gerásim
in
christian
fashion
he
wanted
to
escort
her
to
the
town
barrier
and
at
first
walked
alongside
her
cart
but
suddenly
halted
at
the
crimean
ford
waved
his
hand
and
directed
his
steps
along
the
river
this
happened
toward
evening
he
walked
quietly
and
stared
at
the
water
suddenly
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
something
were
floundering
in
the
ooze
close
to
the
bank
he
bent
down
and
beheld
a
small
puppy
white
with
black
spots
which
despite
all
its
endeavours
utterly
unable
to
crawl
out
of
the
water
was
struggling
slipping
and
quivering
all
over
its
wet
gaunt
little
body
gerásim
gazed
at
the
unfortunate
puppy
picked
it
up
with
one
hand
thrust
it
into
his
breast
and
set
out
with
great
strides
homeward
he
entered
his
little
den
laid
the
rescued
puppy
on
his
bed
covered
it
with
his
heavy
coat
ran
first
to
the
stable
for
straw
then
to
the
kitchen
for
a
cup
of
milk
cautiously
throwing
back
the
coat
and
spreading
out
the
straw
he
placed
the
milk
on
the
bed
the
poor
little
dog
was
only
three
weeks
old
it
had
only
recently
got
its
eyes
open
and
one
eye
even
appeared
to
be
a
little
larger
than
the
other
it
did
not
yet
know
how
to
drink
out
of
a
cup
and
merely
trembled
and
blinked
gerásim
grasped
it
lightly
with
two
fingers
by
the
head
and
bent
its
muzzle
down
to
the
milk
the
dog
suddenly
began
to
drink
greedily
snorting
shaking
itself
and
lapping
gerásim
gazed
and
gazed
and
then
suddenly
began
to
laugh
all
night
he
fussed
over
it
put
it
to
bed
wiped
it
off
and
at
last
fell
asleep
himself
beside
it
in
a
joyous
tranquil
slumber
no
mother
tends
her
infant
as
gerásim
tended
his
nursling
the
dog
proved
to
be
a
bitch
in
the
beginning
she
was
very
weak
puny
and
but
little
by
little
she
improved
in
health
and
looks
and
at
the
end
of
eight
months
thanks
to
the
indefatigable
care
of
her
rescuer
she
had
turned
into
a
very
fair
sort
of
a
dog
of
spanish
breed
with
long
ears
a
feathery
tail
in
the
form
of
a
trumpet
and
large
expressive
eyes
she
attached
herself
passionately
to
gerásim
never
left
him
by
a
pace
and
was
always
following
him
wagging
her
tail
and
he
had
given
her
a
name
too
the
dumb
know
that
their
bellowing
attracts
other
people
attention
to
them
he
called
her
mumú
all
the
people
in
the
house
took
a
liking
to
her
and
also
called
her
dear
little
mumú
she
was
extremely
intelligent
fawned
upon
every
one
but
loved
gerásim
alone
gerásim
himself
loved
her
madly
and
it
was
disagreeable
to
him
when
others
stroked
her
whether
he
was
afraid
for
her
or
jealous
of
her
god
knows
she
waked
him
up
in
the
morning
by
tugging
at
his
she
led
to
him
by
the
reins
the
old
with
whom
she
dwelt
in
great
amity
with
importance
depicted
on
her
face
she
went
with
him
to
the
river
she
stood
guard
over
the
brooms
and
shovels
and
allowed
no
one
to
enter
his
room
he
cut
out
an
aperture
in
his
door
expressly
for
her
and
she
seemed
to
feel
that
only
in
gerásim
little
den
was
she
the
full
mistress
and
therefore
on
entering
it
with
a
look
of
satisfaction
she
immediately
leaped
upon
the
bed
at
night
she
did
not
sleep
at
all
but
she
did
not
bark
without
discernment
like
a
stupid
which
sitting
on
its
haunches
and
elevating
its
muzzle
and
shutting
its
eyes
barks
simply
out
of
tedium
at
the
stars
and
usually
three
times
in
succession
no
mumú
shrill
voice
never
resounded
without
cause
either
a
stranger
was
approaching
too
close
to
the
fence
or
some
suspicious
noise
or
rustling
had
arisen
somewhere
in
a
word
she
kept
capital
watch
truth
to
tell
there
was
in
addition
to
her
an
old
dog
in
the
courtyard
yellow
in
hue
speckled
with
dark
brown
by
name
but
that
dog
was
never
unchained
even
by
night
and
he
himself
owing
to
his
decrepitude
did
not
demand
freedom
but
lay
there
curled
up
in
his
kennel
and
only
now
and
then
emitted
a
hoarse
almost
soundless
bark
which
he
immediately
broke
off
short
as
though
himself
conscious
of
its
utter
futility
mumú
did
not
enter
the
and
when
gerásim
carried
wood
to
the
rooms
she
always
remained
behind
and
impatiently
awaited
him
with
ears
pricked
up
and
her
head
turning
now
to
the
right
then
suddenly
to
the
left
at
the
slightest
noise
indoors
in
this
manner
still
another
year
passed
gerásim
continued
to
discharge
his
avocations
as
and
was
very
well
satisfied
with
his
lot
when
suddenly
an
unexpected
incident
occurred
namely
one
fine
summer
day
the
mistress
with
her
was
walking
about
the
she
was
in
good
spirits
and
was
laughing
and
jesting
the
were
laughing
and
jesting
also
but
felt
no
particular
mirth
the
people
of
the
household
were
not
very
fond
of
seeing
the
mistress
in
merry
mood
because
in
the
first
place
at
such
times
she
demanded
instantaneous
and
complete
sympathy
from
every
one
and
flew
into
a
rage
if
there
was
a
face
which
did
not
beam
with
satisfaction
and
in
the
second
place
these
fits
did
not
last
very
long
and
were
generally
succeeded
by
a
gloomy
and
frame
of
mind
on
that
day
she
seemed
to
have
got
up
happily
at
cards
she
held
four
knaves
the
fulfilment
of
desire
she
always
told
fortunes
with
the
cards
in
the
morning
and
her
tea
struck
her
as
particularly
delicious
in
consequence
whereof
the
maid
received
praise
in
words
and
ten
kopéks
in
money
with
a
sweet
smile
on
her
wrinkled
lips
the
lady
of
the
house
strolled
about
her
and
approached
the
window
a
was
laid
out
in
front
of
the
window
and
in
the
very
middle
of
the
border
under
a
lay
mumú
assiduously
gnawing
a
bone
the
mistress
caught
sight
of
her
my
god
she
suddenly
exclaimed
what
dog
is
that
the
whom
the
mistress
addressed
floundered
poor
creature
with
that
painful
uneasiness
which
generally
takes
possession
of
a
dependent
person
when
he
does
not
quite
know
how
he
is
to
understand
his
superior
exclamation
i
d
do
o
know
she
stammered
i
think
it
belongs
to
the
dumb
man
my
god
her
mistress
interrupted
her
why
it
is
a
very
pretty
dog
order
it
to
be
brought
hither
has
he
had
it
long
how
is
it
that
i
have
not
seen
it
before
order
it
to
be
brought
hither
the
immediately
fluttered
out
into
the
anteroom
man
man
she
screamed
bring
mumú
here
at
once
she
is
in
the
and
so
her
name
is
mumú
said
the
mistress
a
very
nice
name
akh
very
nice
indeed
replied
the
be
quick
stepán
stepán
a
sturdy
young
fellow
who
served
as
footman
rushed
headlong
to
the
garden
and
tried
to
seize
mumú
but
the
latter
cleverly
slipped
out
of
his
fingers
and
elevating
her
tail
set
off
at
full
gallop
to
gerásim
who
was
in
the
kitchen
beating
out
and
shaking
out
the
twirling
it
about
in
his
hands
like
a
child
drum
stepán
ran
after
her
and
tried
to
seize
her
at
the
very
feet
of
her
master
but
the
agile
dog
would
not
surrender
herself
into
the
hands
of
a
stranger
and
kept
leaping
and
evading
him
gerásim
looked
on
at
all
this
tumult
with
a
grin
at
last
stepán
rose
in
wrath
and
hastily
gave
him
to
understand
by
signs
that
the
mistress
had
ordered
the
dog
to
be
brought
to
her
gerásim
was
somewhat
surprised
but
he
called
mumú
lifted
her
from
the
ground
and
handed
her
to
stepán
stepán
carried
her
into
the
and
placed
her
on
the
polished
wood
floor
the
mistress
began
to
call
the
dog
to
her
in
a
caressing
voice
mumú
who
had
never
in
her
life
been
in
such
magnificent
rooms
was
extremely
frightened
and
tried
to
dart
through
the
door
but
rebuffed
by
the
obsequious
stepán
fell
to
trembling
and
crouched
against
the
wall
mumú
mumú
come
hither
to
me
said
the
mistress
come
thou
stupid
creature
do
be
afraid
come
mumú
come
to
the
mistress
repeated
the
dependents
come
but
mumú
looked
anxiously
about
and
did
not
stir
from
the
spot
bring
her
something
to
eat
said
the
what
a
stupid
thing
she
is
she
wo
come
to
the
mistress
what
is
she
afraid
of
she
feels
strange
still
remarked
one
of
the
dependents
in
a
timid
and
imploring
voice
stepán
brought
a
saucer
of
milk
and
set
it
in
front
of
mumú
but
mumú
did
not
even
smell
of
the
milk
and
kept
on
trembling
and
gazing
about
her
as
before
akh
who
ever
saw
such
a
creature
said
the
mistress
as
she
approached
her
bent
down
and
was
on
the
point
of
stroking
her
but
mumú
turned
her
head
and
displayed
her
teeth
in
a
the
mistress
hastily
drew
back
her
hand
a
momentary
silence
ensued
mumú
whined
faintly
as
though
complaining
and
excusing
herself
the
mistress
retreated
and
frowned
the
sudden
movement
had
frightened
her
akh
cried
all
the
dependents
with
one
accord
she
did
bite
you
did
she
god
forbid
mumú
had
never
bitten
any
one
in
her
life
akh
akh
take
her
away
said
the
old
woman
in
an
altered
voice
the
horrid
little
dog
what
a
vicious
beast
she
is
and
slowly
turning
she
went
toward
her
boudoir
the
dependents
exchanged
timorous
glances
and
started
to
follow
her
but
she
paused
looked
coldly
at
them
said
why
do
you
do
that
for
i
have
not
bidden
you
and
left
the
room
the
dependents
waved
their
hands
in
despair
at
stepán
the
latter
picked
up
mumú
and
flung
her
out
into
the
yard
as
speedily
as
possible
straight
at
gerásim
feet
and
half
an
hour
later
a
profound
stillness
reigned
in
the
house
and
the
old
gentlewoman
sat
on
her
divan
more
lowering
than
a
what
trifles
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
can
sometimes
put
a
person
out
of
tune
the
lady
was
out
of
sorts
until
evening
talked
with
no
one
did
not
play
cards
and
passed
a
bad
night
she
took
it
into
her
head
that
they
had
not
given
her
the
same
de
which
they
usually
gave
her
that
her
pillow
smelled
of
soap
and
made
the
keeper
of
the
smell
all
the
twice
in
a
word
she
was
upset
and
extremely
incensed
on
the
following
morning
she
ordered
gavríla
to
be
summoned
to
her
presence
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
tell
me
please
she
began
as
soon
as
the
latter
not
without
some
inward
quaking
had
crossed
the
threshold
of
her
boudoir
why
that
dog
was
barking
in
our
courtyard
all
night
long
it
prevented
my
getting
to
sleep
a
dog
which
one
perhaps
it
was
the
dumb
dog
he
uttered
in
a
voice
that
was
not
altogether
firm
i
do
know
whether
it
belongs
to
the
dumb
man
or
to
some
one
else
only
it
interfered
with
my
sleep
and
i
am
amazed
that
there
is
such
a
horde
of
dogs
i
want
to
know
about
it
we
have
a
have
we
not
yes
we
have
well
what
need
have
we
for
any
more
dogs
they
only
create
disorder
there
no
head
to
the
house
that
what
the
matter
and
what
does
the
dumb
man
want
of
a
dog
who
has
given
him
permission
to
keep
a
dog
in
my
courtyard
yesterday
i
went
to
the
window
and
it
was
lying
in
the
garden
it
had
brought
some
nasty
thing
there
and
was
gnawing
it
and
i
have
roses
planted
there
the
lady
paused
for
a
while
see
that
it
is
removed
this
very
day
dost
hear
me
i
obey
this
very
day
and
now
go
i
will
have
thee
called
for
thy
report
later
gavríla
left
the
room
as
he
passed
through
the
the
transferred
a
small
bell
from
one
table
to
another
for
show
softly
blew
his
nose
in
the
hall
and
went
out
into
the
anteroom
in
the
anteroom
on
a
locker
stepán
was
sleeping
in
the
attitude
of
a
slain
warrior
in
a
battalion
picture
with
his
bare
legs
projecting
from
his
coat
which
served
him
in
lieu
of
a
coverlet
the
nudged
him
and
imparted
to
him
in
an
undertone
some
order
to
which
stepán
replied
with
a
the
withdrew
and
stepán
sprang
to
his
feet
drew
on
his
kaftan
and
his
boots
went
out
and
came
to
a
standstill
on
the
porch
five
minutes
had
not
elapsed
before
gerásim
made
his
appearance
with
a
huge
fagot
of
firewood
on
his
back
accompanied
by
his
inseparable
mumú
the
mistress
had
issued
orders
that
her
bedroom
and
boudoir
were
to
be
heated
even
in
summer
gerásim
stood
sideways
to
the
door
gave
it
a
push
with
his
shoulder
and
precipitated
himself
into
the
house
with
his
burden
mumú
according
to
her
wont
remained
behind
to
wait
for
him
then
stepán
seizing
a
favourable
moment
made
a
sudden
dash
at
her
like
a
hawk
pouncing
on
a
chicken
crushed
her
to
the
ground
with
his
breast
gathered
her
up
in
his
arms
and
without
stopping
to
don
so
much
as
his
cap
ran
out
into
the
street
with
her
jumped
into
the
first
drozhky
that
came
to
hand
and
galloped
off
to
the
game
market
there
he
speedily
hunted
up
a
purchaser
to
whom
he
sold
her
for
half
a
ruble
stipulating
only
that
the
latter
should
keep
her
tied
up
for
at
least
a
week
and
immediately
returned
home
but
before
he
reached
the
house
he
alighted
from
the
drozhky
and
making
a
circuit
of
the
house
he
leaped
over
the
fence
into
the
yard
from
a
back
alley
he
was
afraid
to
enter
by
the
wicket
lest
he
should
encounter
gerásim
but
his
anxiety
was
wasted
gerásim
was
no
longer
in
the
courtyard
on
coming
out
of
the
house
he
had
instantly
bethought
himself
of
mumú
he
could
not
remember
that
she
had
ever
failed
to
await
his
return
and
he
began
to
run
in
every
direction
to
hunt
for
her
to
call
her
after
his
own
fashion
he
dashed
into
his
little
chamber
to
the
he
darted
into
the
street
hither
and
thither
she
was
gone
he
appealed
to
the
domestics
with
the
most
despairing
signs
inquired
about
her
pointing
fourteen
inches
from
the
ground
he
drew
her
form
with
his
hands
some
of
them
really
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
mumú
and
only
shook
their
heads
others
did
know
and
grinned
at
him
in
reply
but
the
assumed
a
very
pompous
mien
and
began
to
shout
at
the
coachmen
then
gerásim
fled
far
away
from
the
courtyard
twilight
was
already
falling
when
he
returned
one
was
justified
in
assuming
from
his
exhausted
aspect
from
his
unsteady
gait
from
his
dusty
clothing
that
he
had
wandered
over
the
half
of
moscow
he
halted
in
front
of
the
mistress
windows
swept
a
glance
over
the
porch
on
which
seven
were
gathered
turned
away
and
bellowed
once
more
mumú
mumú
did
not
respond
he
went
away
all
stared
after
him
but
no
one
smiled
no
one
uttered
a
word
and
the
curious
postilion
antípka
narrated
on
the
following
morning
in
the
kitchen
that
the
dumb
man
had
moaned
all
night
long
all
the
following
day
gerásim
did
not
show
himself
so
that
potáp
the
coachman
was
obliged
to
go
for
water
in
his
stead
which
greatly
displeased
coachman
potáp
the
mistress
asked
gavríla
whether
her
command
had
been
executed
gavríla
replied
that
it
had
the
next
morning
gerásim
emerged
from
his
chamber
to
do
his
work
he
came
to
dinner
ate
and
went
off
again
without
having
exchanged
greetings
with
any
one
his
face
which
was
inanimate
at
the
best
of
times
as
is
the
case
with
all
deaf
and
dumb
persons
now
seemed
to
have
become
absolutely
petrified
after
dinner
he
again
quitted
the
courtyard
but
not
for
long
returned
and
immediately
directed
his
steps
to
the
night
came
a
clear
moonlight
night
sighing
heavily
and
incessantly
tossing
from
side
to
side
gerásim
was
lying
there
when
he
suddenly
felt
as
though
something
were
tugging
at
the
skirts
of
his
garments
he
trembled
all
over
but
did
not
raise
his
head
nevertheless
and
even
screwed
his
eyes
up
tight
but
the
tugging
was
repeated
more
energetically
than
before
he
sprang
to
his
feet
before
him
with
a
fragment
of
rope
about
her
neck
mumú
was
capering
about
a
prolonged
shriek
of
joy
burst
from
his
speechless
breast
he
seized
mumú
and
clasped
her
in
a
close
embrace
in
one
moment
she
had
licked
his
nose
his
eyes
and
his
beard
he
stood
still
for
a
while
pondering
cautiously
slipped
down
from
the
cast
a
glance
round
him
and
having
made
sure
that
no
one
was
watching
him
he
safely
regained
his
little
chamber
even
before
this
gerásim
had
divined
that
the
dog
had
not
disappeared
of
her
own
volition
that
she
must
have
been
carried
away
by
the
command
for
the
domestics
had
explained
to
him
by
signs
how
his
mumú
had
snapped
at
her
and
he
decided
to
take
precautions
of
his
own
first
he
fed
mumú
with
some
bread
caressed
her
and
put
her
to
bed
then
he
began
to
consider
how
he
might
best
conceal
her
at
last
he
hit
upon
the
idea
of
leaving
her
all
day
in
his
room
and
only
looking
in
now
and
then
to
see
how
she
was
getting
along
and
taking
her
out
for
exercise
at
night
he
closed
the
opening
in
his
door
compactly
by
stuffing
in
an
old
coat
of
his
and
as
soon
as
it
was
daylight
he
was
in
the
courtyard
as
though
nothing
had
happened
even
preserving
innocent
guile
his
former
dejection
of
countenance
it
could
not
enter
the
head
of
the
poor
deaf
man
that
mumú
would
betray
herself
by
her
whining
as
a
matter
of
fact
every
one
in
the
house
was
speedily
aware
that
the
dumb
man
dog
had
come
back
and
was
locked
up
in
his
room
but
out
of
compassion
for
him
and
for
her
and
partly
perhaps
out
of
fear
of
him
they
did
not
give
him
to
understand
that
his
secret
had
been
discovered
the
alone
scratched
the
back
of
his
head
and
waved
his
hand
in
despair
as
much
as
to
say
well
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
matter
perhaps
the
mistress
will
not
get
to
know
of
it
and
never
had
the
dumb
man
worked
so
zealously
as
on
that
day
he
swept
and
scraped
out
the
entire
courtyard
he
rooted
up
all
the
blades
of
grass
to
the
very
last
one
with
his
own
hand
pulled
up
all
the
props
in
the
with
a
view
to
making
sure
that
they
were
sufficiently
firm
and
then
hammered
them
in
again
in
a
word
he
fussed
and
bustled
about
so
that
even
the
mistress
noticed
his
zeal
twice
in
the
course
of
the
day
gerásim
went
stealthily
to
his
captive
and
when
night
came
he
lay
down
to
sleep
in
her
company
in
the
little
room
not
in
the
and
only
at
one
did
he
go
out
to
take
a
stroll
with
her
in
the
fresh
air
having
walked
quite
a
long
time
with
her
in
the
courtyard
he
was
preparing
to
return
when
suddenly
a
noise
resounded
outside
the
fence
in
the
direction
of
the
alley
mumú
pricked
up
her
ears
began
to
growl
approached
the
fence
sniffed
and
broke
forth
into
a
loud
and
piercing
bark
some
drunken
man
or
other
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
nestle
down
there
for
the
night
at
that
very
moment
the
mistress
had
just
got
to
sleep
after
a
prolonged
nervous
excitement
she
always
had
these
excited
fits
after
too
hearty
a
supper
the
sudden
barking
woke
her
her
heart
began
to
beat
violently
and
to
collapse
maids
maids
she
maids
the
frightened
maids
flew
to
her
bedroom
okh
okh
i
dying
said
she
throwing
her
hands
apart
in
there
that
dog
again
again
okh
send
for
the
doctor
they
want
to
kill
me
the
dog
the
dog
again
okh
and
she
flung
back
her
head
which
was
intended
to
denote
a
swoon
they
ran
for
the
doctor
that
is
to
say
for
the
household
medical
man
kharitón
the
whole
art
of
this
healer
consisted
in
the
fact
that
he
wore
boots
with
soft
soles
understood
how
to
feel
the
pulse
delicately
slept
fourteen
hours
out
of
the
spent
the
rest
of
the
time
in
sighing
and
was
incessantly
treating
the
mistress
to
laurel
drops
this
healer
immediately
hastened
to
her
fumigated
with
burnt
feathers
and
when
the
mistress
opened
her
eyes
immediately
presented
to
her
on
a
silver
tray
a
with
the
inevitable
drops
the
mistress
took
them
but
immediately
with
tearful
eyes
began
to
complain
of
the
dog
of
gavríla
of
her
lot
that
she
a
poor
old
woman
had
been
abandoned
by
every
one
that
no
one
had
any
pity
on
her
and
that
every
one
desired
her
death
in
the
meantime
the
unlucky
mumú
continued
to
bark
while
gerásim
strove
in
vain
to
call
her
away
from
the
fence
there
there
it
goes
again
stammered
the
mistress
and
again
rolled
up
her
eyes
the
medical
man
whispered
to
one
of
the
maids
she
rushed
into
the
anteroom
and
explained
matters
to
stepán
the
latter
ran
to
awaken
gavríla
and
gavríla
in
a
passion
gave
orders
that
the
whole
household
should
be
roused
gerásim
turned
round
beheld
the
twinkling
lights
and
shadows
in
the
windows
and
foreboding
in
his
heart
a
catastrophe
he
caught
up
mumú
under
his
arm
ran
into
his
room
and
locked
the
door
a
few
moments
later
five
men
were
thumping
at
his
door
but
feeling
the
resistance
of
the
bolt
desisted
gavríla
ran
up
in
a
frightful
hurry
ordered
them
all
to
remain
there
until
morning
and
stand
guard
while
he
himself
burst
into
the
maids
hall
and
gave
orders
through
the
eldest
companion
liubóff
liubímovna
together
with
whom
he
was
in
the
habit
of
stealing
and
enjoying
tea
sugar
and
other
groceries
that
the
mistress
was
to
be
informed
that
the
dog
unfortunately
had
run
home
again
from
somewhere
or
other
but
that
it
would
not
be
alive
on
the
morrow
and
that
the
mistress
must
do
them
the
favour
not
to
be
angry
and
must
calm
down
the
mistress
probably
would
not
have
calmed
down
very
speedily
had
not
the
medical
man
in
his
haste
poured
out
forty
drops
instead
of
twelve
the
strength
of
the
laurel
took
its
effect
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
mistress
was
sleeping
soundly
and
peacefully
and
gerásim
was
lying
all
pale
on
his
bed
tightly
compressing
mouth
on
the
following
morning
the
mistress
awoke
quite
late
gavríla
was
waiting
for
her
awakening
in
order
to
make
a
decisive
attack
upon
gerásim
asylum
and
was
himself
prepared
to
endure
a
heavy
but
the
did
not
come
off
as
she
lay
in
bed
the
mistress
ordered
the
eldest
dependent
to
be
called
to
her
liubóff
liubímovna
she
began
in
a
soft
weak
voice
she
sometimes
liked
to
pretend
to
be
a
persecuted
and
defenceless
sufferer
it
is
needless
to
state
that
at
such
times
all
the
people
in
the
house
felt
very
uncomfortable
liubóff
liubímovna
you
see
what
my
condition
is
go
my
dear
to
gavríla
andréitch
and
have
a
talk
with
him
it
can
not
be
possible
that
some
nasty
little
dog
or
other
is
more
precious
to
him
than
the
tranquillity
the
very
life
of
his
mistress
i
should
not
like
to
believe
that
she
added
with
an
expression
of
profound
emotion
go
my
dear
be
so
good
go
to
gavríla
andréitch
liubóff
liubímovna
betook
herself
to
gavríla
room
what
conversation
took
place
between
them
is
not
known
but
a
while
later
a
whole
throng
of
domestics
marched
through
the
courtyard
in
the
direction
of
little
den
in
front
walked
gavríla
holding
on
his
cap
with
his
hand
although
there
was
no
wind
around
him
walked
footmen
and
cooks
uncle
tail
gazed
out
of
the
window
and
issued
orders
that
is
to
say
he
merely
spread
his
hands
apart
in
the
rear
of
all
the
small
urchins
leaped
and
capered
one
half
of
them
being
strangers
who
had
run
in
on
the
narrow
stairway
leading
to
the
den
sat
one
sentry
at
the
door
stood
two
others
with
clubs
they
began
to
ascend
the
staircase
and
occupied
it
to
its
full
length
gavríla
went
to
the
door
knocked
on
it
with
his
fist
and
shouted
open
a
suppressed
bark
made
itself
audible
but
there
was
no
reply
open
i
say
he
repeated
but
gavríla
andréitch
remarked
stepán
from
below
he
deaf
you
know
he
does
hear
all
burst
out
laughing
what
is
to
be
done
retorted
gavríla
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
why
he
has
a
hole
in
his
door
replied
stepán
so
do
you
wiggle
a
stick
around
in
it
a
bit
gavríla
bent
down
he
has
stuffed
it
up
with
some
sort
of
coat
that
hole
but
do
you
poke
the
coat
inward
at
this
point
another
dull
bark
rang
out
see
there
see
there
she
giving
herself
away
some
one
remarked
in
the
crowd
and
again
there
was
laughter
gavríla
scratched
behind
his
ear
no
brother
he
went
on
at
last
do
thou
poke
the
coat
through
thyself
if
thou
wishest
why
certainly
and
stepán
scrambled
up
took
a
stick
thrust
the
coat
inside
and
began
to
wiggle
the
stick
about
in
the
opening
saying
come
forth
come
forth
he
was
still
wiggling
the
stick
when
the
door
of
the
little
chamber
flew
suddenly
and
swiftly
open
and
the
whole
train
of
menials
rolled
head
over
heels
down
the
stairs
gavríla
in
the
lead
uncle
tail
shut
the
window
come
come
come
come
shouted
gavríla
from
the
courtyard
just
look
out
look
out
gerásim
stood
motionless
on
the
threshold
the
crowd
assembled
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
gerásim
stared
at
all
these
petty
folk
in
their
foreign
kaftans
from
above
with
his
arms
lightly
set
akimbo
in
his
scarlet
peasant
shirt
he
seemed
like
a
giant
in
comparison
with
them
gavríla
advanced
a
pace
see
here
brother
said
he
i
take
none
of
thy
impudence
and
he
began
to
explain
to
him
by
signs
the
mistress
insists
upon
having
thy
dog
hand
it
over
instantly
or
will
be
the
worse
for
thee
gerásim
looked
at
him
pointed
to
the
dog
made
a
sign
with
his
hand
at
his
own
neck
as
though
he
were
drawing
up
a
noose
and
cast
an
inquiring
glance
at
the
yes
yes
replied
the
latter
nodding
his
head
yes
she
insists
gerásim
dropped
his
eyes
then
suddenly
shook
himself
again
pointed
at
mumú
who
all
this
time
had
been
standing
by
his
side
innocently
wagging
her
tail
and
moving
her
ears
to
and
fro
with
curiosity
repeated
the
sign
of
strangling
over
his
own
neck
and
significantly
smote
himself
on
the
breast
as
though
declaring
that
he
would
take
it
upon
himself
to
annihilate
mumú
but
thou
wilt
deceive
waved
gavríla
to
him
in
reply
gerásim
looked
at
him
laughed
disdainfully
smote
himself
again
on
the
breast
and
slammed
the
door
all
present
exchanged
glances
in
silence
well
and
what
the
meaning
of
this
began
he
has
locked
himself
in
let
him
alone
gavríla
andréitch
said
stepán
he
do
it
if
he
has
promised
that
the
sort
of
fellow
he
is
if
he
once
promises
a
thing
it
safe
he
is
like
us
folks
in
that
respect
what
is
true
is
true
yes
yes
repeated
all
and
wagged
their
that
so
yes
uncle
tail
opened
the
window
and
said
yes
also
well
we
shall
see
i
suppose
returned
gavríla
but
the
guard
is
not
to
be
removed
notwithstanding
hey
there
eróshka
he
added
addressing
a
poor
man
in
a
yellow
nankeen
kazák
coat
who
was
reckoned
as
the
gardener
what
hast
thou
to
do
take
a
stick
and
sit
here
and
if
anything
happens
run
for
me
on
the
instant
eróshka
took
a
stick
and
sat
down
on
the
last
step
of
the
staircase
the
crowd
dispersed
with
the
exception
of
a
few
curious
bodies
and
the
small
urchins
while
gavríla
returned
home
and
through
liubóff
liubímovna
gave
orders
that
the
mistress
should
be
informed
that
everything
had
been
done
and
that
he
himself
in
order
to
make
quite
sure
had
sent
the
postilion
for
a
policeman
the
mistress
tied
a
knot
in
her
handkerchief
poured
de
on
it
sniffed
at
it
wiped
her
temples
sipped
her
tea
and
being
still
under
the
influence
of
the
laurel
drops
fell
asleep
again
an
hour
after
all
this
commotion
the
door
of
the
tiny
den
opened
and
gerásim
made
his
appearance
he
wore
a
new
holiday
kaftan
he
was
leading
mumú
by
a
string
eróshka
drew
aside
and
let
him
pass
gerásim
directed
his
way
toward
the
gate
all
the
small
boys
who
were
in
the
courtyard
followed
him
with
their
eyes
in
silence
he
did
not
even
turn
round
he
did
not
put
on
his
cap
until
he
reached
the
street
gavríla
despatched
after
him
that
same
eróshka
in
the
capacity
of
observer
eróshka
perceiving
from
afar
that
he
had
entered
an
in
company
with
his
dog
awaited
his
reappearance
in
the
they
knew
gerásim
and
understood
his
signs
he
ordered
with
meat
and
seated
himself
with
his
arms
resting
on
the
table
mumú
stood
beside
his
chair
calmly
gazing
at
him
with
her
intelligent
eyes
her
coat
was
fairly
shining
with
gloss
it
was
evident
that
she
had
recently
been
brushed
they
brought
the
to
gerásim
he
crumbled
up
bread
in
it
cut
the
meat
up
into
small
pieces
and
set
the
plate
on
the
floor
mumú
began
to
eat
with
her
customary
politeness
hardly
touching
her
muzzle
to
the
food
gerásim
stared
long
at
her
two
heavy
tears
rolled
suddenly
from
his
eyes
one
fell
on
the
dog
sloping
forehead
the
other
into
the
soup
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hand
mumú
ate
half
a
plateful
and
retired
licking
her
chops
gerásim
rose
paid
for
the
soup
and
set
out
accompanied
by
the
somewhat
astounded
glance
of
the
waiter
eróshka
on
catching
sight
of
gerásim
sprang
round
the
corner
and
allowing
him
to
pass
again
set
out
on
his
track
gerásim
walked
on
without
haste
and
did
not
release
mumú
from
the
cord
on
reaching
the
corner
of
the
street
he
halted
as
though
in
thought
and
suddenly
directed
his
course
with
swift
strides
straight
toward
the
crimean
ford
on
the
way
he
entered
the
yard
of
a
house
to
which
a
wing
was
being
built
and
brought
thence
two
bricks
under
his
arm
from
the
crimean
ford
he
turned
along
the
bank
advanced
to
a
certain
spot
where
stood
two
boats
with
oars
tied
to
stakes
he
had
already
noted
them
previously
and
sprang
into
one
of
them
in
company
with
mumú
a
lame
little
old
man
emerged
from
behind
a
hut
placed
in
one
corner
of
a
and
shouted
at
him
but
gerásim
only
nodded
his
head
and
set
to
rowing
so
vigorously
although
against
the
current
that
in
an
instant
he
had
darted
off
to
a
distance
of
a
hundred
fathoms
the
old
man
stood
and
stood
scratched
his
back
first
with
the
left
hand
then
with
the
right
and
returned
limping
to
his
hut
but
gerásim
rowed
on
and
on
and
now
he
had
left
moscow
behind
him
now
already
meadows
fields
groves
stretched
along
the
shores
and
peasant
cottages
made
their
appearance
it
smacked
of
the
country
he
flung
aside
the
oars
bent
his
head
down
to
mumú
who
was
sitting
in
front
of
him
on
a
dry
thwart
the
bottom
was
inundated
with
water
and
remained
motionless
with
his
mighty
hands
crossed
on
her
back
while
the
boat
drifted
a
little
backward
with
the
current
toward
the
town
at
last
gerásim
straightened
up
hastily
with
a
sort
of
painful
wrath
on
his
face
wound
the
rope
around
the
bricks
he
had
taken
arranged
a
noose
put
it
on
mumú
neck
lifted
her
over
the
river
for
the
last
time
gazed
at
her
she
gazed
back
at
him
confidingly
and
without
alarm
waving
her
little
tail
slightly
he
turned
away
shut
his
eyes
and
opened
his
hands
gerásim
heard
nothing
neither
the
swift
whine
of
the
falling
mumú
nor
the
loud
splash
of
the
water
for
him
the
noisiest
day
was
silent
and
speechless
as
not
even
the
quietest
night
is
to
us
and
when
he
opened
his
eyes
again
the
little
waves
were
hurrying
down
the
river
as
before
as
before
they
were
plashing
about
the
sides
of
the
boat
and
only
far
astern
toward
the
shore
certain
broad
circles
were
spreading
eróshka
as
soon
as
gerásim
vanished
from
his
sight
returned
home
and
reported
what
he
had
seen
well
yes
remarked
stepán
he
will
drown
her
you
may
be
easy
about
that
if
he
has
once
promised
a
thing
throughout
the
day
no
one
saw
gerásim
he
did
not
dine
at
home
evening
came
all
except
him
assembled
for
supper
what
a
queer
fellow
that
gerásim
is
squealed
a
fat
laundress
the
idea
of
making
such
a
fuss
over
a
dog
really
but
gerásim
has
been
here
suddenly
exclaimed
stepán
as
he
scooped
up
his
buckwheat
groats
with
his
spoon
what
when
why
a
couple
of
hours
ago
certainly
he
has
i
met
him
at
the
gate
he
has
gone
away
from
here
again
he
went
out
of
the
courtyard
i
wanted
to
ask
him
about
his
dog
but
he
evidently
was
out
of
sorts
well
and
he
jostled
me
it
must
have
been
done
by
accident
he
only
wanted
to
get
me
out
of
the
way
as
much
as
to
say
bother
me
but
he
gave
me
such
a
dig
in
the
spine
that
óï
óï
óï
and
stepán
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
an
involuntary
grimace
and
rubbed
the
nape
of
his
yes
he
added
his
hand
is
an
apt
one
there
no
denying
that
all
laughed
at
stepán
and
after
supper
dispersed
to
their
beds
and
in
the
meantime
on
that
same
night
on
the
highway
a
giant
was
marching
onward
diligently
and
unremittingly
with
a
sack
on
his
shoulders
and
a
long
staff
in
his
hands
it
was
gerásim
he
was
hurrying
on
without
looking
behind
him
hurrying
home
to
his
own
house
in
the
country
to
his
native
place
after
drowning
poor
mumú
he
had
hastened
to
his
little
den
had
briskly
put
together
a
few
articles
of
clothing
in
an
old
had
tied
it
up
with
a
knot
slung
it
across
his
shoulder
and
taken
himself
off
he
had
noted
well
the
road
when
he
had
been
brought
to
moscow
the
village
from
which
his
mistress
had
taken
him
lay
at
most
versts
from
the
highway
he
walked
along
it
with
a
certain
invincible
hardihood
with
despairing
yet
joyful
firmness
he
strode
onward
his
breast
expanded
broadly
his
eyes
were
bent
eagerly
straight
ahead
he
hastened
onward
as
though
his
aged
mother
were
waiting
for
him
in
his
native
place
as
though
she
had
summoned
him
to
her
after
long
wanderings
in
foreign
lands
among
strange
peoples
the
summer
night
which
had
only
just
descended
was
warm
and
tranquil
on
the
one
hand
in
the
direction
where
the
sun
had
gone
down
the
rim
of
the
sky
was
still
white
with
a
crimson
gleam
from
the
last
reflection
of
the
vanished
day
on
the
other
hand
the
gloom
was
rising
night
had
come
thence
hundreds
of
quail
were
whistling
all
around
were
vying
with
each
other
in
their
calls
gerásim
could
not
hear
them
he
could
not
hear
even
the
delicate
nocturnal
rustling
of
the
trees
past
which
he
was
bearing
his
mighty
feet
but
he
discerned
the
familiar
scent
of
the
ripening
rye
which
was
exhaled
from
the
dark
fields
he
felt
the
breeze
wafting
to
meet
him
the
breeze
from
his
native
place
beating
on
his
face
playing
with
his
hair
and
beard
he
beheld
in
front
of
him
the
road
homeward
gleaming
white
straight
as
an
arrow
he
beheld
in
the
sky
innumerable
stars
which
illuminated
his
path
and
like
a
lion
he
stepped
out
powerfully
and
alertly
so
that
when
the
rising
sun
lighted
up
with
its
rays
the
gallant
fellow
who
had
just
been
driven
to
extremities
versts
already
lay
between
him
and
moscow
at
the
end
of
two
days
he
was
at
home
in
his
own
little
cottage
to
the
great
amazement
of
the
soldier
wife
who
had
removed
thither
after
praying
before
the
holy
pictures
he
immediately
betook
himself
to
the
overseer
the
overseer
was
astounded
at
first
but
the
haying
was
only
just
beginning
gerásim
being
a
capital
workman
immediately
had
a
scythe
put
into
his
hand
and
he
went
off
to
mow
as
of
yore
to
mow
in
such
fashion
that
the
peasants
simply
sweated
through
and
through
as
they
watched
his
swings
and
strokes
but
in
moscow
on
the
day
following
gerásim
flight
they
discovered
it
they
went
into
his
room
ransacked
it
and
told
gavríla
the
latter
came
made
an
inspection
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
decided
that
the
dumb
man
had
either
run
away
or
drowned
himself
along
with
his
stupid
dog
the
police
were
informed
and
the
matter
was
reported
to
the
mistress
the
mistress
flew
into
a
rage
fell
to
weeping
ordered
him
to
be
hunted
up
at
any
cost
asserted
that
she

news
came

arrival
there
the
mistress
calmed
down
somewhat
at
first
she
was
minded
to
issue
an
order
demanding
his
immediate
return
to
moscow
but
afterward
she
announced
that
she
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
so
ungrateful
a
man
moreover
she
died
herself
soon
after
and
her
heirs
had
other
things
to
think
about
besides
gerásim
and
they
dismissed
the
rest
of
their

gerásim
is
living
yet
poor
wretched
fellow
in
his
lonely
hut
he
is
healthy
and
powerful
as
of

and
as
of
yore
he
does
the
work
of
four
men
and
as
of
yore
he
is
staid
and
dignified
but
the
neighbours
have
noticed
that
ever
since
his
return
from
moscow
he
has
entirely
ceased
to
have
anything
to
do
with
women
he
does
not
even
look
at
them
and
he
keeps
not
a
single
dog
on
his
however
say
the
peasants
is
lucky
for
him
that
he
needs
no
woman
and
as
for
a
dog
what
should
he
do
with
a
dog
you
could
drag
a
thief
into

yard
with

such
is
the
fame

from

was
still
standing

a
spacious

well
known
to
drivers
of
to
peasants
to
merchants
clerks
to
traders
of

class

in
general
to
all
the
numerous
and
varied
travellers
who
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
roll
along
our

everybody
used
to
drop
in
at
this
inn

only
some
landed

would

will

nothing
except
hay
and
bread
but
on

other
hand
will
not
be
obliged
to
pay
a
kopék
too
much
in
addition
to
its
advantageous
situation
the
inn
of
which
we
have
just
spoken
possessed
many
attractions
capital
water
in
two
deep
wells
with
creaking
wheels
and
iron
buckets
on
chains
a
spacious
with
plenty
of
board
sheds
on
stout
pillars
an
abundant
supply
of
good
oats
in
the
cellar
a
warm
house
with
a
huge
russian
stove
into
which
as
upon
the
shoulders
of
an
epic
hero
long
logs
were
thrust
two
little
chambers
with
paper
on
the
walls
somewhat
tattered
at
the
bottom
with
a
painted
wooden
divan
chairs
to
match
and
two
pots
of
geranium
in
the
windows
which
however
were
never
washed
and
were
dim
with
the
dust
of
many
years
this
inn
offered
other
comforts
the
blacksmith
shop
was
near
at
hand
and
the
mill
was
situated
almost
alongside
of
it
in
conclusion
good
food
was
to
be
had
in
it
thanks
to
the
fat
and
who
was
the
cook
and
who
prepared
the
viands
in
a
savoury
manner
and
with
plenty
of
fat
and
was
not
stingy
of
her
stores
the
nearest
was
only
half
a
verst
distant
the
landlord
kept
snuff
which
although
mixed
with
ashes
was
extremely
heady
and
tickled
the
nose
agreeably
in
a
word
there
were
many
reasons
why
guests
of
every
sort
were
not
lacking
in
that
inn
travellers
had
taken
a
fancy
to
it
that
is
the
principal
thing
without
that
as
is
well
known
no
business
will
thrive
and
it
was
liked
most
of
all
because
as
people
said
in
the
countryside
the
landlord
himself
was
very
lucky
and
succeeded
in
all
his
enterprises
although
he
little
deserved
his
luck
and
it
was
evident
that
if
a
man
is
destined
to
be
lucky
he
will
be
this
landlord
was
a
petty
burgher
naúm
ivánoff
by
name
he
was
of
medium
stature
stooping
and
he
had
a
large
round
head
hair
which
was
wavy
and
already
grizzled
although
in
appearance
he
was
not
over
forty
years
of
age
a
plump
and
rosy
face
a
low
but
white
and
smooth
brow
and
small
bright
blue
eyes
with
which
he
gazed
forth
very
strangely
askance
and
at
the
same
time
insolently
which
is
a
combination
rarely
encountered
he
always
held
his
head
in
a
drooping
position
and
turned
it
with
difficulty
perhaps
because
his
neck
was
very
short
he
walked
briskly
and
did
not
swing
his
arms
but
opened
his
clenched
fists
as
he
walked
when
he
smiled
and
he
smiled
frequently
but
without
laughter
as
though
to
himself
his
large
lips
moved
apart
in
an
unpleasant
way
and
displayed
a
row
of
compact
and
dazzling
teeth
he
spoke
abruptly
and
with
a
certain
surly
sound
in
his
voice
he
shaved
off
his
beard
but
did
not
adopt
the
foreign
dress
his
garments
consisted
of
a
long
kaftan
ample
and
shoes
worn
on
the
bare
feet
he
often
absented
himself
from
home
on
business
and
he
had
a
great
deal
of
business
he
was
a
jobber
of
horses
he
hired
land
he
raised
vegetables
for
the
market
he
purchased
gardens
and
in
general
occupied
himself
with
various
commercial
speculations
but
his
absences
never
lasted
long
like
the
hawk
to
whom
in
particular
especially
as
to
the
expression
of
his
eyes
he
bore
a
strong
resemblance
he
kept
returning
to
his
nest
he
understood
how
to
keep
that
nest
in
order
he
kept
track
of
everything
he
heard
everything
and
gave
orders
about
everything
he
dealt
out
he
served
out
and
calculated
everything
himself
and
while
he
did
not
reduce
his
price
a
kopék
to
any
one
yet
he
did
not
overcharge
the
lodgers
did
not
enter
into
conversation
with
him
and
he
himself
was
not
fond
of
wasting
words
without
cause
i
need
your
money
and
you
need
my
victuals
he
was
wont
to
explain
as
though
he
were
tearing
off
each
separate
word
you
and
i
have
got
to
stand
godparents
to
a
child
and
become
cronies
the
traveller
has
eaten
i
have
fed
him
his
fill
let
him
not
outstay
his
welcome
and
if
he
is
sleepy
then
let
him
sleep
not
chatter
he
kept
sturdy
and
healthy
but
tame
and
submissive
labourers
they
were
extremely
afraid
of
him
he
never
took
a
drop
of
intoxicating
liquor
into
his
mouth
but
he
gave
each
of
them
ten
kopéks
for
vodka
on
festival
days
on
other
days
they
did
not
dare
to
drink
people
like
naúm
speedily
grow
rich
but
naúm
ivánoff
had
not
reached
the
brilliant
condition
in
which
he
found
himself
and
he
was
reckoned
to
be
worth
forty
or
fifty
thousand
rubles
by
straightforward
ways
twenty
years
previous
to
the
date
at
which
we
have
set
the
beginning
of
our
story
an
inn
existed
on
that
same
site
upon
the
highway
truth
to
tell
it
had
not
that
plank
roof
which
imparted
to
naúm
ivánoff
house
the
aspect
of
a
nobleman
and
it
was
poorer
in
its
construction
and
the
sheds
in
the
were
thatched
and
the
walls
were
made
of
wattled
boughs
instead
of
boards
neither
was
it
distinguished
by
a
triangular
greek
pediment
on
turned
columns
but
it
was
a
very
decent
sort
of
inn
nevertheless
spacious
solid
and
warm
and
travellers
gladly
frequented
it
its
landlord
at
that
time
was
not
naúm
ivánoff
but
a
certain
akím
semyónoff
the
serf
of
a
neighbouring
landed
proprietress
lizavéta
prókhorovna
kuntze
the
widow
of
a
this
akím
was
an
intelligent
peasant
with
good
business
capacity
who
having
started
with
two
wretched
little
nags
as
a
carrier
in
his
youth
returned
a
year
later
with
three
good
horses
and
from
that
time
forth
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
life
in
roaming
along
the
highways
visited
kazán
and
odessa
orenbúrg
and
warsaw
and
went
abroad
to
lipetzk
and
travelled
toward
the
last
with
two
tróïkas
of
huge
and
powerful
stallions
harnessed
to
two
enormous
carts
whether
it
was
that
he
became
bored
by
this
homeless
roving
life
or
whether
he
was
seized
with
the
desire
to
set
up
a
family
in
one
of
his
absences
his
wife
had
died
the
children
which
he
had
had
died
also
at
all
events
he
decided
at
last
to
abandon
his
former
avocation
and
set
up
an
inn
with
the
permission
of
his
mistress
he
established
himself
on
the
highway
purchased
in
her
name
half
a
of
land
and
erected
thereon
an
inn
the
venture
proved
a
success
he
had
more
than
enough
money
for
the
installation
the
experience
which
he
had
acquired
in
his
prolonged
wanderings
to
all
parts
of
russia
was
of
the
greatest
advantage
to
him
he
knew
how
to
please
travellers
especially
men
of
his
own
former
calling
carriers
with
many
of
whom
he
was
personally
acquainted
and
whose
patronage
is
particularly
valued
by
the
so
much
do
these
people
eat
and
consume
for
themselves
and
their
robust
horses
akím
inn
became
known
for
hundreds
of
versts
round
about
people
were
even
fonder
of
patronising
him
than
they
were
of
patronising
naúm
who
afterward
succeeded
him
although
akím
was
far
from
being
comparable
to
naúm
in
his
knowledge
of
the
landlord
business
akím
had
everything
established
on
the
footing
warm
but
not
quite
clean
and
it
sometimes
happened
that
his
oats
turned
out
to
be
light
or
damp
and
the
food
also
was
prepared
in
rather
indifferent
fashion
such
victuals
were
sometimes
served
on
his
table
as
had
been
better
left
in
the
oven
for
good
and
that
not
because
he
was
stingy
with
material
but
just
because
it
happened
so
his
wife
had
not
looked
after
things
on
the
other
hand
he
was
ready
to
deduct
from
the
price
and
he
would
even
not
refuse
to
give
credit
in
a
word
he
was
a
good
man
and
an
amiable
landlord
he
was
liberal
also
with
his
conversation
and
standing
treat
over
the
samovár
he
would
sometimes
get
to
babbling
so
that
you
would
prick
up
your
ears
especially
when
he
began
to
talk
about
peter
about
the
tcherkessian
steppes
or
about
foreign
parts
well
and
as
a
matter
of
course
he
was
fond
of
drinking
with
a
nice
man
only
not
to
excess
and
more
for
the
sake
of
sociability
so
travellers
said
of
him
merchants
bore
great
toward
him
as
in
general
did
all
those
people
who
call
themselves
those
people
who
do
not
set
out
on
a
journey
without
having
girded
themselves
and
who
do
not
enter
a
room
without
crossing
themselves
and
who
will
not
enter
into
conversation
with
a
man
without
having
preliminarily
bidden
him
good
morning
akím
mere
personal
appearance
disposed
one
in
his
favour
he
was
tall
rather
gaunt
but
very
well
built
even
in
his
mature
years
he
had
a
long
comely
and
regular
face
a
high
open
brow
a
thin
straight
nose
and
small
lips
the
glance
of
his
prominent
brown
eyes
fairly
beamed
with
gentle
cordiality
his
thin
soft
hair
curled
in
rings
about
his
neck
very
little
of
it
remained
on
the
crown
of
his
head
the
sound
of
akím
voice
was
very
agreeable
although
weak
in
his
youth
he
had
been
a
capital
singer
but
his
long
journeys
in
the
open
air
in
winter
had
impaired
his
lungs
on
the
other
hand
he
spoke
very
fluently
and
sweetly
when
he
laughed
wrinkles
very
pleasant
to
behold
spread
themselves
out
around
his
eyes
such
wrinkles
are
to
be
seen
only
in
kind
people
akím
movements
were
generally
slow
and
not
devoid
of
a
certain
and
sedate
courtesy
as
was
befitting
a
man
of
experience
who
had
seen
much
in
his
day
in
fact
akím
would
have
been
all
right
or
as
they
called
him
even
in
the
whither
he
was
wont
to
go
frequently
as
well
as
unfailingly
on
sundays
after
the
morning
service
in
church
akím
semyónovitch
would
have
been
all
right
in
every
respect
had
he
not
had
one
failing
which
has
ruined
many
men
on
this
earth
and
in
the
end
ruined
him
also
a
weakness
for
the
female
sex
akím
amorousness
went
to
extremes
his
heart
was
utterly
unable
to
resist
a
feminine
glance
he
melted
in
it
as
the
first
autumnal
snow
melts
in
the
sun
and
he
had
to
pay
dearly
for
his
superfluous
sensibility
in
the
course
of
the
first
year
after
he
had
settled
down
upon
the
highway
akím
was
so
occupied
with
the
building
of
his
inn
with
the
installation
of
his
establishment
and
with
all
the
worries
which
are
inseparable
from
all
new
households
that
he
positively
had
not
time
to
think
of
women
and
if
any
sinful
thoughts
did
enter
his
head
he
promptly
expelled
them
by
the
perusal
of
divers
holy
books
for
which
he
cherished
a
great
respect
he
had
taught
himself
to
read
and
write
during
his
first
trip
as
carrier
by
chanting
the
psalms
in
an
undertone
or
by
some
other
pious
occupation
moreover
he
was
already
in
his
year
and
at
that
age
all
passions
sensibly
calm
down
and
grow
cool
and
the
time
for
marrying
was
past
akím
himself
had
begun
to
think
that
that
folly
as
he
expressed
it
had
broken
loose
from
him
but
evidently
no
man
can
escape
his
fate
akím
former
owner
lizavéta

who
had
been
left
a
widow
by
her
husband

german
extraction
was
herself
a
native
of
the
town
of
mittau
where
she
had
passed
the
early
days
of
her
childhood
and
where
she
still
had
a
very
numerous
and
needy
family
concerning
whom
however
she
troubled
herself
very
little
especially
since
one
of
her
brothers
an
officer
in
an
army
infantry
regiment
had
unexpectedly
presented
himself
at
her
house
and
on
the
following
day
had
raised
such
an
uproar
that
he
had
all
but
thrashed
the
mistress
of
the
house
herself
and
had
addressed
her
into
the
bargain
as
lumpenmamsell
while
on
the
preceding
evening
he
had
himself
called

architect

herself
managed
it
and
managed
it
far
from

lizavéta
prókhorovna
did
not
let
slip
the
smallest
source
of
profit
she
derived
advantage
to
herself
from
everything
and
in
this
point
as
well
as
in
that
of
remarkable
cleverness
in
making
one
kopék
serve
instead
of
two
her
german
nationality
betrayed
itself
in
everything

she
had
become
extremely
russified

herself
was
a
gossip
she
was
fond
of
loading
a
man
down
with
her
favours
and
suddenly
stunning
him
with
disgrace
in
a
word
lizavéta
prókhorovna
conducted
herself
exactly
like
a
she
favoured
akím
he
paid
her
a
good
round
with
punctuality
she
chatted
graciously
with
him
and
even
in
jest
invited
him
to
be
her
guest
but
it
was
precisely
in
the
that
calamity
awaited
akím
among
the
number
of
lizavéta
prókhorovna
maids
there
was
one
young
girl
of
twenty
an
orphan
dunyásha
by
name
she
was
not
was
well
formed
and
clever
her
features
although
not
regular
were
calculated
to
please
her
fresh
complexion
her
thick
fair
hair
her
red
lips
and
a
certain
dashing
expression
of
face
were
all
quite
charming
in
their
way
moreover
in
spite
of
her
orphaned
state
she
bore
herself
staidly
almost
haughtily
she
was
descended
from
an
ancient
line
of
her
late
father
aréfy
had
been
for
thirty
years
and
her
grandfather
stepán
had
served
as
valet
to
a
gentleman
long
since
deceased
a
sergeant
of
the
guards
and
a
prince
she
dressed
neatly
and
was
proud
of
her
hands
which
really
were
extremely
handsome
dunyásha
showed
great
disdain
for
all
her
admirers
listened
to
their
sweet
sayings
with
a
conceited
smile
and
if
she
answered
them
it
was
chiefly
by
exclamation
only
in
the
nature
of
yes
certainly
catch
me
doing
that
the
idea
these
exclamations
scarcely
ever
left
her
tongue
dunyásha
had
spent
about
three
years
in
moscow
under
instruction
where
she
had
acquired
those
peculiar
grimaces
and
manners
which
characterise
chambermaids
who
have
sojourned
in
the
capitals
people
spoke
of
her
as
a
conceited
girl
a
great
encomium
in
the
mouths
of
domestics
who
although
she
had
seen
much
of
life
had
not
lowered
her
dignity
she
sewed
far
from
badly
moreover
but
nevertheless
lizavéta
prókhorovna
had
no
particular
liking
for
her
thanks
to
the
head
maid
kiríllovna
a
woman
no
longer
young
sly
and
fond
of
intrigue
kiríllovna
profited
by
her
great
influence
over
her
mistress
and
contrived
very
artfully
to
keep
rivals
out
of
the
way
and
it
was
with
this
dunyásha
that
akím
fell
in
love
and
in
a
way
such
as
he
had
never
loved
before
he
beheld
her
for
the
first
time
in
church
she
had
only
just
returned
from
moscow
then
he
met
her
several
times
in
the
at
last
he
spent
a
whole
evening
with
her
at
the
overseer
whither
he
had
been
invited
to
tea
along
with
other
honourable
personages
the
did
not
look
down
on
him
although
he
did
not
belong
to
their
social
class
and
wore
a
beard
but
he
was
a
cultured
man
could
read
and
write
and
chief
thing
of
all
he
had
money
moreover
he
did
not
dress
in
peasant
fashion
but
wore
a
long
kaftan
of
black
cloth
boots
of
dressed
and
a
small
kerchief
round
his
neck
to
tell
the
truth
some
of
the
did
make
remarks
among
themselves
to
the
effect
is
plain
nevertheless
that
he
is
not
one
of
us
but
to
his
face
they
almost
flattered
him
that
evening
at
the
overseer
dunyásha
completed
the
conquest
of
akím
amorous
heart
although
she
positively
did
not
reply
by
a
single
word
to
all
his
ingratiating
speeches
and
only
now
and
then
cast
a
glance
at
him
as
though
astonished
at
seeing
that
peasant
there
all
this
only
inflamed
akím
the
more
he
went
off
home
thought
and
thought
and
made
up
his
mind
to
obtain
her
hand
so
thoroughly
had
she
bewitched
him
but
how
shall
we
describe
dunyásha
wrath
and
indignation
when
five
days
later
kiríllovna
affectionately
calling
her
into
her
room
announced
to
her
that
akím
and
evidently
he
had
understood
how
to
set
about
the
business
that
that
and
peasant
akím
to
sit
beside
whom
she
had
regarded
as
an
insult
was
courting
her
at
first
dunyásha
flushed
hot
all
over
then
she
emitted
a
forced
laugh
then
fell
to
weeping
but
kiríllovna
conducted
the
attack
so
artfully
so
clearly
made
her
feel
her
position
in
the
house
so
cleverly
hinted
at
akím
decent
appearance
wealth
and
blind
devotion
and
in
conclusion
so
significantly
alluded
to
the
mistress
own
wishes
that
dunyásha
left
the
room
with
hesitation
depicted
on
her
face
and
encountering
akím
merely
gazed
intently
into
his
eyes
but
did
not
turn
away
the
fabulously
lavish
gifts
of
this
enamoured
man
dispelled
her
last
doubts
lizavéta
prókhorovna
to
whom
akím
in
his
joy
had
presented
a
hundred
peaches
on
a
large
silver
salver
gave
her
consent
to
his
marriage
with
dunyásha
and
the
wedding
took
place
akím
spared
no
expense
and
the
bride
who
on
the
eve
of
the
wedding
had
sat
in
the
maids
room
like
one
on
the
verge
of
expiring
and
had
done
nothing
but
cry
on
the
very
morning
of
the
wedding
while
kiríllovna
was
dressing
her
for
the
ceremony
was
speedily
comforted
her
mistress
gave
her
her
own
shawl
to
wear
in
church
and
that
very
same
day
akím
gave
her
another
of
the
same
sort
only
almost
better
so
then
akím
married
and
transported
his
young
wife
to
his
inn
they
began
to
live
dunyásha
proved
to
be
a
bad
housekeeper
a
poor
helpmeet
for
her
husband
she
never
looked
after
anything
she
grieved
was
bored
unless
some
passing
officer
was
attentive
to
her
and
paid
court
to
her
as
he
sat
behind
the
capacious
samovár
she
frequently
absented
herself
sometimes
going
to
the
town
to
shop
sometimes
to
the
mistress
which
lay
four
versts
distant
from
the
inn
in
the
she
refreshed
herself
there
people
of
her
own
sort
surrounded
her
the
maids
envied
her
smart
attire
kiríllovna
treated
her
to
tea
lizavéta
prókhorovna
herself
chatted
with
her
but
even
these
visits
did
not
pass
off
without
bitter
emotions
for
dunyásha
for
instance
being
a
she
was
not
allowed
to
wear
a
bonnet
and
was
obliged
to
muffle
her
head
up
in
a
kerchief
like
a
merchant
wife
as
the
crafty
kiríllovna
said
to
her
like
the
wife
of
a
petty
burgher
thought
dunyásha
to
herself
more
than
once
there
recurred
to
akím
mind
the
words
of
his
only
relative
an
aged
uncle
an
inveterate
peasant
a
man
without
family
or
land
well
brother
akímushka
he
had
said
to
him
when
he
met
him
in
the
street
i
have
heard
that
thou
well
yes
i
am
what
of
it
ekh
akím
akím
thou
no
mate
for
us
peasants
now
there
no
denying
it
neither
is
she
a
mate
for
thee
but
why
is
she
a
mate
for
me
why
for
this
reason
at
least
returned
the
other
pointing
to
akím
beard
which
he
to
please
his
bride
had
begun
to
clip
close
he
would
not
consent
to
shave
it
off
entirely
akím
dropped
his
eyes
and
the
old
man
turned
away
wrapped
about
him
the
skirts
of
his
sheepskin
coat
which
was
ragged
on
the
shoulders
and
went
his
way
shaking
his
head
yes
more
than
once
did
akím
grow
pensive
grunt
and
sigh
but
his
love
for
his
pretty
wife
did
not
diminish
he
was
proud
of
her
especially
when
he
compared
her
not
only
with
the
other
peasant
women
or
with
his
former
wife
whom
he
had
married
at
the
age
of
sixteen
but
with
the
other
maids
of
the
class
as
much
as
to
say
just
see
what
sort
of
a
bird
we
captured
her
slightest
caress
afforded
him
great
pleasure
perhaps
he
thought
to
himself
she
get
used
to
me
she
grow
accustomed
to
her
new
life
moreover
she
conducted
herself
very
well
and
no
one
could
say
an
evil
word
concerning
her
several
years
passed
in
this
manner
dunyásha
really
did
end
by
becoming
used
to
her
existence
the
older
akím
grew
the
more
attached
he
became
to
her
and
the
more
he
trusted
her
her
friends
who
had
married
men
not
of
the
peasant
class
suffered
dire
need
or
were
in
distress
or
had
fallen
into
evil
hands
but
akím
continued
to
wax
richer
and
richer
he
succeeded
in
everything
he
was
lucky
only
one
thing
grieved
him
god
had
not
given
him
any
children
dunyásha
was
already
in
her
year
every
one
had
come
to
call
her
avdótya
aréfyevna
nevertheless
she
had
not
become
a
good
but
she
had
come
to
love
her
home
she
attended
to
the
stores
of
provisions
she
looked
after
the
truth
to
tell
she
did
all
this
in
an
indifferent
way
and
did
not
exercise
the
proper
oversight
as
to
cleanliness
and
order
but
on
the
other
hand
in
the
principal
room
of
the
inn
alongside
the
portrait
of
akím
hung
her
portrait
painted
in
oils
and
ordered
by
her
from
a
artist
the
son
of
the
parish
she
was
represented
in
a
white
gown
and
a
yellow
shawl
with
six
rows
of
large
pearls
on
her
neck
long
earrings
in
her
ears
and
rings
on
every
finger
it
was
possible
to
recognise
her
although
the
painter
had
depicted
her
as
extremely
corpulent
and
and
had
painted
her
eyes
black
instead
of
grey
and
even
a
trifle
squinting
he
had
not
succeeded
at
all
with
akím
the
latter
had
somehow
turned
out
very
dark
la
so
that
a
traveller
would
sometimes
step
up
and
stare
at
it
and
merely
bellow
a
bit
avdótya
had
begun
to
dress
with
a
good
deal
of
carelessness
she
would
throw
a
large
kerchief
over
her
shoulders
and
the
gown
under
it
would
fit
anyhow
indolence
had
taken
possession
of
her
that
sighing
languid
sleepy
indolence
to
which
russians
are
but
too
greatly
inclined
especially
when
their
existence
is
assured
nevertheless
the
affairs
of
akím
and
his
wife
throve
very
well
they
lived
in
concord
and
bore
the
reputation
of
being
an
exemplary
married
pair
but
like
the
squirrel
which
is
cleaning
its
nose
at
the
very
moment
when
the
arrow
is
aimed
at
it
a
man
has
no
foreboding
of
his
own
disaster
and
suddenly
down
he
crashes
as
though
on
the
ice
one
autumn
evening
a
merchant
with
stopped
at
akím
inn
he
was
making
his
way
by
devious
roads
with
two
loaded
kibítkas
from
moscow
to
khárkoff
he
was
one
of
those
peddlers
whom
the
wives
and
daughters
of
landed
proprietors
sometimes
await
with
so
much
impatience
with
this
peddler
already
an
elderly
man
were
travelling
two
comrades
or
to
put
it
more
accurately
two
workmen
one
pale
thin
the
other
a
stately
handsome
young
fellow
of
twenty
they
ordered
supper
then
sat
down
to
drink
tea
the
peddler
invited
the
landlord
and
landlady
to
drink
a
cup
with
him
and
they
did
not
refuse
a
conversation
was
speedily
under
way
between
the
two
old
men
akím
had
seen
his
birthday
the
peddler
was
making
inquiries
concerning
the
neighbouring
landed
proprietors
and
no
one
could
impart
to
him
all
necessary
details
about
them
better
than
could
akím
the
labourer
kept
continually
going
out
to
look
at
the
carts
and
at
last
took
himself
off
to
sleep
avdótya
was
left
to
chat
with
the
other
labourer
she
sat
beside
him
and
talked
little
and
chiefly
listened
to
what
he
narrated
to
her
but
evidently
his
remarks
pleased
her
her
face
grew
animated
a
flush
played
over
her
cheeks
and
she
laughed
quite
often
and
readily
the
young
labourer
sat
almost
motionless
with
his
curly
head
bent
toward
the
table
he
spoke
softly
without
raising
his
voice
and
without
haste
on
the
other
hand
his
eyes
not
large
but
audaciously
bright
and
blue
fairly
bored
into
avdótya
at
first
she
turned
away
from
them
then
she
began
to
gaze
into
his
face
the
young
fellow
face
was
as
fresh
and
smooth
as
a
crimean
apple
he
smiled
frequently
and
drummed
his
white
fingers
on
his
white
chin
already
covered
with
sparse
dark
down
he
expressed
himself
after
the
merchant
fashion
but
with
great
ease
and
with
a
certain
careless
and
kept
staring
at
her
all
the
while
with
the
same
insistent
and
insolent
look
suddenly
he
moved
a
little
closer
to
her
and
without
changing
the
expression
of
his
face
in
the
least
he
said
to
her
avdótya
aréfyevna
there
nobody
in
the
world
nicer
than
you
i
ready
to
die
for
you
i
do
believe
avdótya
laughed
loudly
what
the
matter
with
thee
akím
asked
her
why
this
man
here
is
telling
such
absurd
things
she
said
but
without
any
special
confusion
the
old
peddler
grinned
he
he
yes
that
naúm
of
mine
is
such
a
joker
sir
but
you
must
listen
to
him
yes
certainly
as
if
i
would
listen
to
him
she
replied
and
shook
her
head
he
he
of
course
remarked
the
old
well
but
he
added
in
a
drawl
i
much
obliged
but
now
is
time
to
go
to
roost
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
we
are
much
obliged
sir
too
sir
said
akím
also
for
the
entertainment
that
is
to
say
but
now
we
wish
you
good
night
sir
rise
avdótyushka
avdótya
rose
as
though
reluctantly
and
after
her
naúm
rose
also
and
all
dispersed
the
landlord
and
landlady
betook
themselves
to
the
small
room
which
served
them
as
a
bedroom
akím
set
to
snoring
instantly
avdótya
could
not
get
to
sleep
for
a
long
time
at
first
she
lay
still
with
her
face
turned
to
the
wall
then
she
began
to
toss
about
on
the
hot
now
throwing
off
now
drawing
up
the
coverlet
then
she
fell
into
a
light
doze
all
of
a
sudden
a
man
loud
voice
resounded
in
the
yard
it
was
singing
some
slow
but
not
mournful
song
the
words
of
which
could
not
be
distinguished
avdótya
opened
her
eyes
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
and
began
to
listen
the
song
still
went
on
it
poured
forth
sonorously
on
the
autumnal
air
akím
raised
his
head
who
that
singing
he
inquired
i
do
know
she
replied
he
sings
well
he
added
after
a
brief
well
what
a
strong
voice
i
used
to
sing
in
my
day
he
continued
and
i
sang
well
but
my
voice
is
ruined
but
that
a
fine
singer
it
must
be
that
young
fellow
singing
naúm
is
his
name
i
think
and
he
turned
over
on
his
other
side
drew
a
deep
breath
and
fell
asleep
again
the
voice
did
not
cease
for
a
long
time
thereafter
avdótya
continued
to
listen
and
listen
at
last
it
suddenly
broke
off
short
as
it
were
then
uttered
one
more
wild
shout
and
slowly
died
away
avdótya
crossed
herself
and
laid
her
head
on
the
pillow
half
an
hour
elapsed
she
raised
herself
and
began
softly
to
get
out
of
bed
whither
art
thou
going
wife
akím
asked
her
through
his
sleep
she
stopped
short
to
adjust
the
she
answered
somehow
or
other
i
ca
sleep
thou
hadst
better
say
thy
prayers
stammered
akím
as
he
fell
asleep
avdótya
went
to
the
began
to
adjust
it
and
incautiously
extinguished
it
she
returned
and
lay
down
in
bed
silence
reigned
early
on
the
following
morning
the
merchant
set
out
on
his
way
with
his
companions
avdótya
was
sleeping
akím
escorted
them
for
about
half
a
verst
he
was
obliged
to
go
to
the
mill
on
returning
home
he
found
his
wife
already
dressed
and
no
longer
alone
with
her
was
the
young
fellow
of
the
previous
evening
naúm
they
were
standing
by
the
table
near
the
window
and
talking
together
on
catching
sight
of
akím
avdótya
silently
left
the
room
but
naúm
said
that
he
had
returned
for
his
master
mittens
which
the
latter
had
forgotten
on
the
bench
and
he
also
left
the
room
we
shall
now
inform
our
readers
of
that
which
they
no
doubt
have
already
divined
without
our
aid
avdótya
had
fallen
passionately
in
love
with
naúm
how
this
could
come
to
pass
so
quickly
it
is
difficult
to
explain
it
is
all
the
more
difficult
in
that
up
to
that
time
she
had
behaved
in
an
irreproachable
manner
notwithstanding
numerous
opportunities
and
temptations
to
betray
her
marital
vows
later
on
when
her
relations
with
naúm
became
public
many
persons
in
the
countryside
declared
that
on
that
very
first
evening
he
had
put
some
magic
herb
into
her
tea
people
with
us
still
believe
firmly
in
the
efficacy
of
this
method
and
that
this
was
very
readily
to
be
discerned
in
avdótya
who
they
said
very
soon
thereafter
began
to
grow
thin
and
bored
however
that
may
be
at
all
events
naúm
began
to
be
frequently
seen
at
akím
inn
first
he
journeyed
past
with
that
same
merchant
but
three
months
later
he
made
his
appearance
alone
with
his
own
wares
then
a
rumour
became
current
that
he
had
taken
up
his
residence
in
one
of
the
towns
of
the
county
and
from
that
time
forth
not
a
week
passed
that
his
stout
painted
cart
drawn
by
a
pair
of
plump
horses
which
he
drove
himself
did
not
make
its
appearance
on
the
highway
there
was
no
great
friendship
between
him
and
akím
but
no
hostility
between
them
was
apparent
akím
paid
no
great
attention
to
him
and
knew
nothing
about
him
except
that
he
was
an
intelligent
young
fellow
who
had
started
out
boldly
he
did
not
suspect
avdótya
real
feelings
and
continued
to
trust
her
as
before
thus
passed
two
years
more
then
one
summer
day
before
dinner
about
one
lizavéta
prókhorovna
who
precisely
during
the
course
of
those
two
years
had
somehow
suddenly
grown
wrinkled
and
sallow
despite
all
sorts
of
massage
rouge
and
powder
lizavéta
prókhorovna
with
her
and
her
folding
parasol
strolled
forth
for
a
walk
in
her
neat
little
german
park
lightly
rustling
her
starched
gown
she
was
walking
with
mincing
steps
along
the
sanded
path
between
two
rows
of
dahlias
drawn
up
in
military
array
when
suddenly
she
was
overtaken
by
our
old
acquaintance
kiríllovna
who
respectfully
announced
that
a
certain
merchant
from
desired
to
see
her
on
a
very
important
matter
kiríllovna
as
of
yore
enjoyed
the
mistress
favour
in
reality
managed
the
estate
of
madame
kuntze
and
some
time
previously
had
received
permission
to
wear
a
white
which
imparted
still
more
harshness
to
the
thin
features
of
her
swarthy
face
a
merchant
inquired
the
lady
what
does
he
want
i
do
know
what
he
wants
replied
kiríllovna
in
a
wheedling
voice
but
apparently
he
wishes
to
purchase
something
from
you
lizavéta
prókhorovna
returned
to
the
seated
herself
in
her
customary
place
an
with
a
canopy
over
which
ivy
meandered
prettily
and
ordered
the
merchant
from
to
be
summoned
naúm
entered
made
his
bow
and
halted
at
the
door
i
have
heard
that
you
wish
to
buy
something
from
me
began
lizavéta
prókhorovna
and
thought
to
herself
the
while
what
a
handsome
man
this
merchant
is
exactly
so
and
precisely
what
is
it
will
you
not
deign
to
sell
your
inn
what
inn
why
the
one
which
stands
on
the
highway
not
far
from
here
but
that
inn
does
not
belong
to
me
that
is
akím
inn
why
is
it
yours
it
stands
on
your
land
assuming
that
the
land
is
mine
bought
in
my
name
still
the
inn
is
his
just
so
so
then
wo
you
sell
it
to
us
i
am
to
sell
it
just
so
and
we
would
pay
a
good
price
for
it
lizavéta
prókhorovna
maintained
silence
for
a
while
really
this
is
strange
she
began
again
what
are
you
saying
but
how
much
would
you
give
she
that
is
to
say
i
am
not
asking
for
myself
but
for
akím
why
with
all
the
buildings
and
dependencies
well
and
of
course
with
the
land
attached
to
the
inn
we
would
give
two
thousand
rubles
two
thousand
rubles
that
very
little
replied
lizavéta
prókhorovna
that
the
proper
price
but
have
you
talked
it
over
with
akím
why
should
we
talk
with
him
the
inn
is
yours
so
we
have
thought
best
to
discuss
it
with
you
but
i
have
already
told
you
really
this
is
astonishing
how
is
it
that
you
do
not
understand
me
why
do
we
understand
we
do
lizavéta
prókhorovna
looked
at
naúm
naúm
looked
at
lizavéta
prókhorovna
how
is
it
to
be
then
he
began
what
proposal
have
you
to
make
on
your
side
that
is
to
say
on
my
side
lizavéta
prókhorovna
fidgeted
about
in
her
in
the
first
place
i
tell
you
that
two
thousand
is
not
enough
and
in
the
second
place
we
add
a
hundred
if
you
like
lizavéta
prókhorovna
rose
i
see
that
you
are
talking
at
and
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
can
not
and
will
not
sell
that
inn
i
can
not
that
is
to
say
i
will
not
naúm
smiled
and
made
no
reply
for
a
while
well
as
you
like
he
remarked
with
a
slight
shrug
of
the
shoulders
i
will
bid
you
and
he
made
his
bow
and
grasped
the
lizavéta
prókhorovna
turned
toward
him
however
she
said
with
barely
perceptible
hesitation
you
need
not
go
just
yet
she
rang
the
bell
kiríllovna
made
her
appearance
from
the
boudoir
kiríllovna
order
the
servants
to
give
the
merchant
i
will
see
you
later
on
she
added
with
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head
naúm
bowed
again
and
left
the
room
in
company
with
kiríllovna
lizavéta
prókhorovna
paced
up
and
down
the
room
a
couple
of
times
then
rang
the
bell
again
this
time
a
page
entered
she
ordered
him
to
summon
kiríllovna
in
a
few
moments
kiríllovna
entered
with
barely
a
squeak
of
her
new
shoes
didst
thou
hear
began
lizavéta
prókhorovna
with
a
constrained
smile
what
that
merchant
is
proposing
to
me
such
a
queer
man
really
no
i
did
hear
what
is
it
and
kiríllovna
slightly
narrowed
her
little
black
kalmýk
eyes
he
wants
to
buy
akím
inn
from
me
and
what
of
that
why
seest
thou
but
how
about
akím
i
have
given
it
to
akím
and
good
gracious
my
lady
what
is
it
you
are
pleased
to
say
is
that
inn
yours
are
we
your
property
pray
and
everything
we
have
is
that
also
the
property
of
the
mistress
mercy
me
what
that
thou
saying
kiríllovna
lizavéta
prókhorovna
got
out
her
batiste
handkerchief
and
nervously
blew
her
akím
bought
that
inn
out
of
his
own
money
out
of
his
own
money
and
where
did
he
get
that
money
was
it
through
your
kindness
and
then
see
how
long
he
has
enjoyed
the
use
of
the
land
surely
all
this
is
through
your
kindness
and
do
you
think
madam
that
even
so
he
will
not
have
more
money
left
why
he
richer
than
you
are
as
god
is
my
witness
all
that
is
so
of
course
but
nevertheless
i
can
not
how
am
i
to
sell
that
inn
but
why
not
sell
it
went
on
luckily
a
purchaser
has
turned
up
permit
me
to
inquire
how
much
does
he
offer
you
over
two
thousand
rubles
said
lizavéta
prókhorovna
softly
he
give
more
madam
if
he
offers
two
thousand
at
the
first
word
and
you
can
settle
with
akím
afterward
you
can
reduce
his
i
he
will
still
be
grateful
of
course
his
must
be
reduced
but
no
kiríllovna
how
can
i
sell
and
lizavéta
prókhorovna
paced
up
and
down
the
room
no
it
is
impossible
it
is
right
no
please
say
no
more
to
me
about
it
or
i
shall
get
angry
but
in
spite
of
the
prohibition
of
the
excited
lizavéta
prókhorovna
kiríllovna
continued
to
talk
and
half
an
hour
later
she
returned
to
naúm
whom
she
had
left
in
the
butler
pantry
with
the
samovár
what
have
you
to
tell
me
my
most
respected
said
naúm
foppishly
turning
his
empty
cup
upside
down
on
his
saucer
this
is
what
i
have
to
tell
you
returned
kiríllovna
that
you
are
to
go
to
the
mistress
she
bids
you
come
i
obey
replied
naúm
rising
and
followed
kiríllovna
to
the
the
door
closed
behind
them
when
at
last
that
door
opened
again
and
naúm
backed
out
of
it
bowing
the
matter
was
already
settled
inn
belonged
to
him
he
had
acquired
it
for
two
thousand
eight
hundred
rubles
in
they
had
decided
to
complete
the
deed
of
sale
as
promptly
as
possible
and
not
to
announce
the
sale
until
that
was
accomplished
lizavéta
prókhorovna
had
received
one
hundred
rubles
as
deposit
and
two
hundred
rubles
went
to
kiríllovna
as
commission
i
have
got
it
at
a
bargain
thought
naúm
as
he
climbed
into
his
cart
i
glad
it
turned
out
well
at
that
very
time
when
the
bargain
which
we
have
described
was
being
effected
at
the
akím
was
sitting
alone
on
the
under
the
window
in
his
own
room
and
stroking
his
beard
with
an
air
of
displeasure
we
have
stated
above
that
he
did
not
suspect
his
fondness
for
naúm
although
kind
persons
had
more
than
once
hinted
to
him
that
it
was
high
time
for
him
to
listen
to
reason
of
course
he
himself
was
sometimes
able
to
observe
that
his
housewife
for
some
time
past
had
become
more
restive
but
then
all
the
world
knows
that
the
female
sex
is
vain
and
capricious
even
when
it
really
seemed
to
him
that
something
was
wrong
he
merely
waved
it
from
him
he
did
not
wish
as
the
saying
is
to
raise
a
row
his
had
not
diminished
with
the
years
and
moreover
indolence
was
making
itself
felt
but
on
that
day
he
was
very
much
out
of
sorts
on
the
previous
evening
he
had
unexpectedly
overheard
on
the
street
a
conversation
between
his
and
another
woman
one
of
his
neighbours
the
woman
had
asked
his
why
she
had
not
run
in
to
see
her
on
the
evening
of
the
holiday
i
was
expecting
thee
she
said
why
i
would
have
come
replied
the
but
shameful
to
say
i
caught
the
mistress
at
her
capers
bad
luck
to
her
thou
didst
catch
her
repeated
the
in
a
tone
propping
her
cheek
on
her
and
where
didst
thou
catch
her
my
mother
why
behind
the
the
priest
the
mistress
seest
thou
had
gone
out
to
the
to
meet
that
fellow
of
hers
that
naúm
and
i
could
see
in
the
dark
whether
because
of
the
moonlight
or
what
not
the
lord
knows
and
so
i
ran
right
against
them
thou
didst
run
against
them
repeated
the
well
and
what
was
she
doing
my
mother
was
she
standing
with
him
she
was
standing
right
enough
he
was
standing
and
she
was
standing
she
caught
sight
of
me
and
says
she
art
thou
running
to
take
thyself
off
home
so
i
went
thou
wentest
the
was
silent
for
a
well
fetíniushka
she
said
and
went
her
way
this
conversation
had
produced
an
unpleasant
effect
on
akím
his
love
for
avdótya
had
already
grown
cold
but
nevertheless
the
words
displeased
him
and
she
had
told
the
truth
as
a
matter
of
fact
avdótya
had
gone
out
that
evening
to
meet
naúm
who
had
waited
for
her
in
the
dense
shadow
which
fell
upon
the
road
from
the
tall
and
motionless
the
dew
had
drenched
its
every
stalk
from
top
to
bottom
the
scent
powerful
to
the
point
of
oppressiveness
lay
all
around
the
moon
had
only
just
risen
huge
and
crimson
in
the
dim
and
the
blackish
mist
naúm
had
heard
avdótya
hasty
footsteps
from
afar
and
had
advanced
to
meet
her
she
reached
him
all
pale
with
running
the
moon
shone
directly
in
her
face
well
how
now
hast
thou
brought
it
he
asked
her
yes
i
have
she
replied
in
an
irresolute
tone
but
naúm
ivánovitch
what
give
it
here
if
thou
hast
brought
it
he
interrupted
her
stretching
out
his
hand
she
drew
from
beneath
her
kerchief
on
her
neck
some
sort
of
packet
naúm
instantly
grasped
it
and
thrust
it
into
his
breast
naúm
ivánitch
enunciated
avdótya
slowly
and
without
taking
her
eyes
from
him
okh
naúm
ivánitch
i
am
ruining
my
soul
for
thee
at
that
moment
the
had
come
upon
them
so
then
akím
was
sitting
on
the
and
stroking
his
beard
with
his
dissatisfaction
avdótya
kept
entering
the
house
and
leaving
it
he
merely
followed
her
with
his
eyes
at
last
she
entered
yet
again
and
taking
a
warm
wadded
jacket
from
the
little
room
she
was
already
crossing
the
threshold
but
he
could
endure
it
no
longer
and
began
to
talk
as
though
to
himself
i
wonder
he
began
what
makes
these
always
so
fidgety
that
they
should
sit
still
in
one
spot
is
something
that
ca
be
demanded
of
them
that
no
affair
of
theirs
but
what
they
do
love
is
to
be
running
off
somewhere
or
other
morning
or
yes
avdótya
heard
her
husband
speech
out
to
the
end
without
changing
her
attitude
only
at
the
word
evening
she
moved
her
head
a
mere
trifle
and
seemed
to
become
thoughtful
well
semyónitch
she
said
at
last
with
irritation
is
well
known
that
when
thou
beginnest
to
talk
why
she
waved
her
hand
and
departed
slamming
the
door
behind
her
avdótya
did
not
in
fact
hold
akím
eloquence
in
high
esteem
and
it
sometimes
happened
when
he
undertook
of
an
evening
to
argue
with
the
travellers
or
began
to
tell
stories
she
would
yawn
quietly
or
walk
out
of
the
room
akím
stared
at
the
closed
door
when
thou
beginnest
to
talk
he
repeated
in
an
undertone
that
exactly
it
that
i
have
talked
very
little
with
thee
and
who
art
thou
my
equal
and
moreover
and
he
rose
meditated
and
dealt
himself
a
blow
on
the
nape
of
his
neck
with
his
clenched
fist
a
few
days
passed
after
this
day
in
a
decidedly
queer
manner
akím
kept
on
staring
at
his
wife
as
though
he
were
preparing
to
say
something
to
her
and
she
on
her
side
darted
suspicious
glances
at
him
moreover
both
of
them
maintained
a
constrained
silence
this
silence
however
was
generally
broken
by
some
snappish
remark
from
akím
about
some
neglect
in
the
housekeeping
or
on
the
subject
of
women
in
general
avdótya
for
the
most
part
did
not
answer
him
with
a
single
word
but
despite
all
akím
weakness
matters
would
infallibly
have
come
to
a
decisive
explanation
between
him
and
avdótya
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
at
last
an
incident
occurred
after
which
all
explanations
would
have
been
superfluous
namely
one
morning
akím
and
his
wife
were
just
preparing
to
take
a
light
meal
after
the
noon
hour
there
was
not
a
single
traveller
in
the
inn
after
the
summer
labours
when
suddenly
a
small
cart
rumbled
energetically
along
the
road
and
drew
up
at
the
porch
akím
glanced
through
the
small
window
frowned
and
dropped
his
eyes
from
the
cart
without
haste
naúm
alighted
avdótya
did
not
see
him
but
when
his
voice
resounded
in
the
anteroom
the
spoon
trembled
weakly
in
her
hand
he
ordered
the
hired
man
to
put
his
horse
in
the
yard
at
last
the
door
flew
wide
open
and
he
entered
the
room
morning
he
said
and
doffed
his
cap
morning
repeated
akím
through
his
whence
has
god
brought
thee
from
the
neighbourhood
returned
the
other
seating
himself
on
the
i
come
from
the
from
the
mistress
said
akím
still
not
rising
from
his
on
business
pray
yes
on
business
avdótya
aréfyevna
our
respects
to
you
good
morning
naúm
she
replied
all
remained
silent
for
a
space
what
have
you
there
some
sort
of
porridge
i
suppose
began
naúm
yes
porridge
retorted
akím
and
suddenly
paled
but
it
is
for
thee
naúm
darted
a

into
the
street

akím
ivánitch

cried
the
fetínya
who
collided
with
him
in
the
doorway
to
the
mistress
let
me
go
to
the
mistress
roared
akím
and
catching
sight
of
naúm
cart
which
the
servants
had
not
yet
had
time
to
put
in
the
he
sprang
into
it
seized
the
reins
and
lashing
the
horse
with
all
his
might
he
set
off
at
a
gallop
to
the
lady
dear
little
mother
lizavéta
prókhorovna
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
all
the
way
why
such
unkindness
i
have
shown
zeal
methinks
and
in
the
meantime
he
kept
on
beating
the
horse
those
who
met
him
drew
aside
and
gazed
long
after
him
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
akím
had
reached
lizavéta
prókhorovna
manor
had
dashed
up
to
the
porch
had
leaped
from
the
cart
and
burst
straight
into
the
anteroom
what
dost
thou
want
muttered
the
startled
footman
who
was
sweetly
dozing
on
the
locker
the
mistress
i
must
see
the
mistress
vociferated
akím
loudly
the
lackey
was
astounded
has
anything
happened
he
began
nothing
has
happened
but
i
must
see
the
mistress
what
what
said
the
lackey
more
and
more
astounded
straightening
himself
up
akím
recovered
himself
it
was
as
though
he
had
been
drenched
with
cold
water
announce
to
the
mistress
piótr
evgráfitch
he
said
with
a
low
obeisance
that
akím
wishes
to
see
her
good
i
will
go
i
will
announce
thee
but
evidently
thou
art
drunk
wait
grumbled
the
lackey
and
withdrew
akím
dropped
his
eyes
and
became
confused
as
it
were
his
boldness
had
swiftly
abandoned
him
from
the
very
moment
he
had
entered
the
anteroom
lizavéta
prókhorovna
was
also
disconcerted
when
akím
arrival
was
announced
to
her
she
immediately
gave
orders
that
kiríllovna
should
be
called
to
her
in
her
boudoir
i
can
not
receive
him
she
said
hurriedly
as
soon
as
the
latter
made
her
appearance
i
can
not
possibly
do
it
what
can
i
say
to
him
did
i
tell
thee
that
he
would
be
sure
to
come
and
would
complain
she
added
with
vexation
and
agitation
i
said
so
why
should
you
receive
him
calmly
replied
kiríllovna
that
is
not
necessary
why
should
you
disturb
yourself
pray
but
what
am
i
to
do
if
you
will
permit
me
i
will
talk
with
him
lizavéta
prókhorovna
raised
her
head
pray
do
me
the
favour
kiríllovna
do
talk
with
him
do
thou
tell
him
there
well
that
i
found
it
necessary
and
moreover
that
i
will
make
it
up
to
him
well
there
now
thou
knowest
what
to
say
pray
do
kiríllovna
please
do
not
fret
madam
returned
kiríllovna
and
withdrew
with
squeaking
shoes
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
not
elapsed
when
their
squeaking
became
audible
again
and
kiríllovna
entered
the
boudoir
with
the
same
composed
expression
on
her
face
with
the
same
crafty
intelligence
in
her
eyes
well
inquired
her
mistress
how
about
akím
is
all
right
he
says
that
everything
is
in
your
power
he
submits
himself
wholly
to
the
will
of
your
graciousness
and
if
only
you
keep
well
and
prosperous
he
will
forever
be
satisfied
with
his
lot
and
he
made
no
complaint
none
whatever
what
was
there
for
him
to
complain
about
but
why
did
he
come
then
said
lizavéta
prókhorovna
not
without
some
surprise
why
he
came
to
ask
until
he
receives
compensation
whether
you
will
not
be
so
gracious
as
to
remit
his
for
the
coming
year
that
is
to
say
of
course
i
will
i
will
remit
it
put
in
lizavéta
prókhorovna
with
vivacity
of
course
and
tell
him
in
general
terms
that
i
will
reward
him
well
i
thank
thee
kiríllovna
and
he
is
a
good
peasant
i
see
stay
she
added
here
give
him
this
from
me
and
she
took
out
of
her
a
here
take
this
and
give
it
to
him
i
obey
replied
kiríllovna
and
coolly
returning
to
her
own
room
she
coolly
locked
up
the
in
an
casket
which
stood
by
the
head
of
her
bed
she
kept
in
it
all
her
ready
money
and
the
amount
was
not
small
kiríllovna
by
her
report
had
soothed
her
lady
but
the
conversation
between
her
and
akím
had
in
reality
not
been
precisely
as
she
represented
it
but
to
wit
she
had
ordered
him
to
be
summoned
to
her
in
the
maids
hall
at
first
he
refused
to
go
to
her
declaring
that
he
did
not
wish
to
see
kiríllovna
but
lizavéta
prókhorovna
herself
nevertheless
at
last
he
submitted
and
wended
his
way
through
the
back
door
to
kiríllovna
he
found
her
alone
on
entering
the
room
he
came
to
a
halt
at
once
leaned
against
the
wall
near
the
door
and
made
an
effort
to
speak
and
could
not
kiríllovna
stared
intently
at
him
do
you
wish
to
see
the
mistress
akím
semyónitch
she
began
he
merely
nodded
his
head
that
is
impossible
akím
semyónitch
and
what
is
the
use
what
is
done
ca
be
undone
and
you
will
only
worry
her
she
can
not
receive
you
now
akím
semyónitch
she
can
not
he
repeated
and
paused
for
a
then
how
is
it
to
be
he
said
at
last
that
means
that
i
must
lose
my
house
hearken
akím
semyónitch
i
know
that
you
have
always
been
a
reasonable
man
this
is
the
mistress
will
and
it
can
not
be
changed
you
can
not
alter
it
there
is
nothing
for
you
and
me
to
discuss
for
it
will
lead
to
no
result
is
that
so
akím
put
his
hands
behind
his
back
but
you
had
better
consider
went
on
kiríllovna
whether
you
ought
not
to
ask
the
mistress
to
remit
your
had
you
that
means
that
i
must
lose
the
house
repeated
akím
in
the
same
tone
as
before
akím
semyónitch
i
told
you
already
is
impossible
to
change
that
you
know
that
yourself
even
better
than
i
do
yes
but
tell
me
at
any
rate
how
much
my
inn
sold
for
i
do
know
that
akím
semyónitch
i
ca
tell
you
but
why
do
you
stand
there
she
sit
down
i
stand
as
i
am
i
a
peasant
i
thank
you
humbly
why
do
you
say
that
you
are
a
peasant
akím
semyónitch
you
are
the
same
as
a
merchant
you
can
not
be
compared
even
with
the
why
do
you
say
that
do
decry
yourself
without
cause
wo
you
have
some
tea
no
thanks
i
do
require
it
and
so
my
dear
little
house
has
become
your
property
he
added
quitting
the
thanks
for
that
also
i
will
bid
you
good
day
my
little
madam
thereupon
he
wheeled
round
and
left
the
room
kiríllovna
smoothed
down
her
apron
and
betook
herself
to
her
mistress
so
it
appears
that
i
actually
have
become
a
merchant
said
akím
to
himself
as
he
paused
in
thought
before
the
a
fine
merchant
he
waved
his
hand
and
laughed
a
bitter
well
i
might
as
well
go
home
and
utterly
oblivious
of
naúm
horse
which
he
had
driven
thither
he
trudged
along
the
road
to
the
inn
before
he
had
covered
the
first
verst
he
heard
the
rattle
of
a
cart
alongside
of
him
akím
akím
semyónitch
some
one
called
to
him
he
raised
his
eyes
and
beheld
his
acquaintance
the
chanter
of
the
parish
church
efrém
nicknamed
the
mole
a
small
man
with
a
little
nose
and
purblind
eyes
he
was
sitting
in
a
rickety
little
cart
on
a
whisp
of
straw
with
his
breast
leaning
on
the
driver
seat
art
thou
on
thy
way
home
pray
he
asked
akím
akím
halted
yes
i
drive
you
there
shall
i
all
right
do
efrém
moved
aside
and
akím
clambered
into
the
cart
efrém
who
was
jolly
with
drink
it
appeared
set
to
lashing
his
miserable
little
nag
with
the
ends
of
his
rope
reins
the
horse
advanced
at
a
weary
trot
incessantly
twitching
her
unbridled
muzzle
they
drove
about
a
verst
without
saying
one
word
to
each
other
akím
sat
with
bowed
head
and
efrém
merely
mumbled
something
to
himself
now
stimulating
the
horse
to
greater
speed
now
reining
it
in
whither
hast
thou
been
without
a
hat
semyónitch
he
suddenly
asked
akím
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
went
on
in
an
undertone
thou
hast
left
it
in
a
nice
little
that
what
thou
a
tippler
i
know
thee
and
i
love
thee
because
thou
art
a
tippler
was
high
time
long
ago
to
place
thee
under
ecclesiastical
censure
god
is
my
witness
because
is
a
bad
business
hurrah
he
shouted
suddenly
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
hurrah
hurrah
halt
halt
rang
out
a
woman
voice
close
at
halt
akím
glanced
round
across
the
fields
in
the
direction
of
the
cart
a
woman
was
running
so
pale
and
dishevelled
that
he
did
not
recognise
her
at
first
halt
halt
she
moaned
again
panting
and
waving
her
arms
akím
shuddered
it
was
his
wife
he
seized
the
reins
and
why
should
we
halt
muttered
efrém
why
should
we
halt
for
a
female
get
but
akím
jerked
the
horse
abruptly
on
its
haunches
at
that
moment
avdótya
reached
the
road
and
fairly
tumbled
headlong
face
downward
in
the
dust
dear
little
father
akím
semyónitch
she
shrieked
he
has
actually
turned
me
out
of
doors
akím
gazed
at
her
and
did
not
move
but
merely
drew
the
reins
still
more
taut
hurrah
cried
efrém
again
and
so
he
has
turned
thee
out
said
akím
he
has
dear
little
father
my
dear
little
dove
replied
avdótya
he
has
turned
me
out

little
father

he
capital
that
just
fine
capital
remarked
efrém
and

said
akím
bitterly
as
he
continued
to
sit
in
the
cart
remain
indeed
yes
dear
little
father
put
in
avdótya
who
had
raised
herself
on
her
knees
and
again
beat
her
brow
against
the
ground
for
thou
dost
not
know
seest
thou
i
kill
me
akím
semyónitch
kill
me
here
on
the
spot
why

beat

aréfyevna
replied
akím
dejectedly
thou
hast
vanquished
thyself
what
more
is
there
to
say
but
what
wilt
thou
think
akím
semyónitch
why
the
money
was
thy
money
it
is

money
for

took
it

from

cellar
i
gave
it
all
to
that
man

naúm
accursed

and
why

tell
me
where

hadst
hidden
thy
money
wretched
being
that
i
am
for
he
bought
the
inn
with
thy
money
the
villain
sobs
drowned
her
voice
akím
clutched
his
head
with
both
hands
what
he
screamed
at
last
and
so
all
the
money
too
the
money
and
the
inn
thou
hast
ah

hast
got
it
from
the
cellar
from
the
cellar
yes

will

brood
of
vipers
and
he
leaped
from
the
cart
semyónitch
semyónitch
do
beat
her
do
fight
stammered
efrém
whose
intoxication
began
to
dissipate
at
such
an
unexpected
event
yes
dear
little
father
kill
me

me
dear
little
father

the
vile
creature

heed

shrieked
avdótya
as
she
writhed
convulsively
at
akím
feet
he
stood
awhile
and
stared
at
her
then
retreated
a
few
paces
and
sat
down
on
the
grass
by
the
roadside
a
brief
silence
ensued
avdótya
turned
her
head
in
his
direction
semyónitch
hey
semyónitch
began
efrém
in
the
cart
have
done
with
that
that
will
do
for
thou
canst
not
repair
the
calamity
phew
what
an
affair
he
continued
as
though
to
himself
what
a
damned
bad
woman
do
thou
go
to
him
he
added
bending
over
the
toward
avdótya
canst
not
see
that
he
has
gone
crazy
avdótya
rose
approached
akím
and
again
fell
at
his
feet
dear
little
father
she
began
in
a
faint
voice
akím
rose
and
went
back
to
the
cart
she
clutched
the
skirt
of
his
kaftan
get
away
he
shouted
fiercely
repulsing
her
whither
art
thou
going
efrém
asked
him
perceiving
that
he
was
taking
his
seat
again
beside
him
why
thou
didst
offer
to
drive

without

didst

my
money
drive
on
efrém
efrém
whipped
up
the
horse
the
cart
rolled
off
and
avdótya
set
up
a
shrill
scream
efrém
lived
a
verst
from
akím
inn
in
a
tiny
cot
in
the
glebe
disposed
around
the
solitary
church
which
had
recently
been
erected
by
the
heirs
of
a
wealthy
merchant
in
conformity
with
his
testamentary
dispositions
efrém
did
not
speak
to
akím
all
the
way
and
only
shook
his
head
from
time
to
time
uttering
words
of
the
following
nature
akh
thou
and
ekh
thou
akím
sat
motionless
slightly
turned
away
from
efrém
at
last
they
arrived
efrém
sprang
out
first
from
the
cart
a
little
girl
of
six
years
in
a
little
chemise
girt
low
ran
out
to
meet
him
and
screamed
daddy
daddy
and
where
is
thy
mother
efrém
asked
her
she
asleep
in
the
kennel
well
let
her
sleep
akím
semyónitch
wo
you
please
come
into
the
house
it
must
be
observed
that
efrém
addressed
him
as
thou
only
when
he
was
intoxicated
far
more
important
persons
than
he
addressed
akím
as
you
akím
entered
the
chanter
cottage
pray
come
hither
to
the
bench
said
run
along
you
little
rogues
he
shouted
at
three
other
brats
who
along
with
two
emaciated
cats
bespattered
with
ashes
suddenly
made
their
appearance
from
various
corners
of
the
run
away
scat
here
akím
semyónitch
come
here
he
went
on
as
he
seated
his
guest
and
would
you
like
something
what
shall
i
say
to
thee
efrém
articulated
akím
at
could
i
have
some
liquor
efrém
gave
a
start
liquor
certainly
i
have
none
in
the
house
liquor
that
is
to
say
but
here
i
run
at
once
to
father
feódor
he
always
has
some
on
hand
i
be
back
in
a
jiffy
and
he
snatched
up
his
cap
and
bring
as
much
as
possible
i
pay
for
it
shouted
akím
after
i
still
have
money
enough
for
that
in
a
jiffy
repeated
efrém
once
more
as
he
disappeared
through
the
door
he
really
did
return
very
speedily
with
two
quart
bottles
under
his
arm
one
of
which
was
already
uncorked
placed
them
on
the
table
got
out
two
small
green
glasses
the
heel
of
a
loaf
and
salt
that
what
i
love
he
kept
repeating
as
he
seated
himself
opposite
what
the
use
of
grieving
he
filled
the
glasses
for
both
and
set
to
babbling
avdótya
behaviour
had
stunned
is
an
astonishing
affair
truly
said
he
how
did
it
come
about
he
must
have
bewitched
her
to
himself
by
magic
hey
that
what
it
means
that
a
woman
should
be
strictly
watched
she
ought
to
have
had
a
tight
hand
kept
over
her
and
yet
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
for
you
to
go
home
for
you
must
have
a
lot
of
property
left
there
i
think
and
to
many
more
speeches
of
the
same
sort
did
efrém
give
utterance
when
he
was
drinking
he
did
not
like
to
hold
his
tongue
an
hour
later
this
is
what
took
place
in
efrém
house
akím
who
had
not
replied
by
a
single
word
during
the
entire
course
of
the
to
the
interrogations
and
comments
of
his
loquacious
host
and
had
merely
drained
glass
after
glass
was
fast
asleep
on
the
oven
all
red
in
the
face
in
a
heavy
anguished
slumber
the
youngsters
were
wondering
at
him
while
efrém
alas
efrém
was
asleep
also
but
only
in
a
very
cramped
and
cold
in
which
he
had
been
locked
up
by
his
wife
a
woman
of
extremely
masculine
and
robust
build
he
had
gone
to
her
in
the
stable
and
had
begun
to
threaten
her
if
she
repeated
something
or
other
but
so
incoherently
and
unintelligibly
did
he
express
himself
that
she
instantly
divined
what
the
trouble
was
grasped
him
by
the
collar
and
led
him
to
the
proper
place
however
he
slept
very
well
and
even
comfortably
in
the
habit
kiríllovna
had
not
reported
her
conversation
with
akím
very
accurately
to
lizavéta
prókhorovna
and
the
same
may
be
said
concerning
avdótya
naúm
had
not
turned
her
out
of
the
house
although
she
had
told
akím
that
he
had
done
so
he
had
not
the
right
to
expel
her
he
was
bound
to
give
the
former
proprietors
time
to
move
out
explanations
of
quite
another
sort
had
taken
place
between
him
and
avdótya
when
akím
had
rushed
into
the
street
shouting
that
he
would
go
to
the
mistress
avdótya
had
turned
to
naúm
had
stared
at
him
with
all
her
eyes
and
clasped
her
hands
o
lord
she
began
naúm
ivánitch
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
have
you
bought
our
inn
what
if
i
have
he
i
have
bought
it
avdótya
said
nothing
for
a
while
then
suddenly
took
fright
so
that
is
what
you
wanted
the
money
for
precisely
as
you
are
pleased
to
put
it
ehe
i
do
believe
that
measly
little
husband
of
yours
has
driven
off
with
my
horse
he
added
as
the
rumble
of
wheels
reached
his
what
a
fine
dashing
fellow
he
is
why
but
this
is
robbery
nothing
else
shrieked
for
the
money
is
ours
my
husband
and
the
inn
is
ours
no
avdótya
aréfyevna
naúm
interrupted
her
the
inn
was
yours
and
what
the
use
of
saying
so
the
inn
stood
on
the
land
so
it
belonged
to
her
also
and
the
money
really
was
yours
only
you
were
so
kind
i
may
put
it
as
to
contribute
it
to
me
and
i
shall
remain
grateful
to
you
and
shall
even
if
the
occasion
arises
return
it
to
you
if
i
should
see
my
way
to
it
only
it
is
right
that
i
should
strip
myself
bare
just
judge
for
yourself
if
that
is
so
naúm
said
all
this
very
calmly
and
even
with
a
slight
smile
good
heavens
screamed
avdótya
but
what
the
meaning
of
this
what
is
it
but
how
am
i
to
show
myself
in
my
husband
sight
after
this
thou
villain
she
added
gazing
with
hatred
at
naúm
young
fresh
face
have
i
ruined
my
soul
for
thee
have
i
become
a
thief
for
thy
sake
hast
not
thou
turned
us
out
of
doors
thou
abominable
villain
after
this
there
is
nothing
left
for
me
but
to
put
a
noose
about
my
neck
villain
deceiver
thou
destroyer
of
me
and
she
wept
in
torrents
pray
do
worry
avdótya
aréfyevna
said
naúm
i
tell
you
one
thing
a
fellow
must
look
out
for
number
one
moreover
that
what
the
pike
is
in
the
sea
for
avdótya
aréfyevna
to
keep
the
carp
from
getting
drowsy
where
are
we
to
go
now
what
is
to
become
of
us
stammered
avdótya
through
her
tears
that
more
than
i
can
tell
but
i
cut
thy
throat
thou
villain
i
will
i
will
no
you
wo
do
that
avdótya
aréfyevna
what
the
use
of
saying
that
but
i
see
that
it
will
be
better
for
me
to
go
away
from
here
for
a
while
or
you
will
be
much
upset
i
will
bid
you
good
day
and
i
shall
return
without
fail
and
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
permit
me
to
send
my
hired
men
to
you
he
added
while
avdótya
continued
to
repeat
through
her
tears
that
she
would
cut
his
throat
and
her
own
also
and
yonder
they
come
by
the
way
he
remarked
looking
out
of
the
window
otherwise
some
catastrophe
might
happen
which
god
forbid
matters
will
be
more
tranquil
so
do
me
the
favour
to
get
your
belongings
together
while
they
will
stand
guard
over
you
and
help
you
if
you
like
i
bid
you
good
day
he
bowed
left
the
room
and
called
his
men
to
him
avdótya
sank
down
on
the
then
laid
herself
breast
down
on
the
table
and
began
to
wring
her
hands
then
suddenly
sprang
to
her
feet
and
ran
after
her
husband
we
have
described
their
meeting
when
akím
drove
away
from
her
in
company
with
efrém
leaving
her
alone
in
the
fields
she
first
wept
for
a
long
time
without
stirring
from
the
spot
having
wept
her
fill
she
directed
her
course
to
the
manor
it
was
a
bitter
thing
for
her
to
enter
the
house
and
still
more
bitter
to
show
herself
in
the
all
the
maids
flew
to
greet
her
with
sympathy
and
expressions
of
regret
at
the
sight
of
them
avdótya
could
not
restrain
her
tears
they
fairly
gushed
forth
from
her
red
and
swollen
eyes
completely
unnerved
she
dropped
down
on
the
first
chair
she
came
to
they
ran
for
kiríllovna
kiríllovna
came
treated
her
very
affectionately
but
would
not
admit
her
to
see
the
mistress
any
more
than
she
had
admitted
akím
avdótya
herself
did
not
insist
very
strongly
on
seeing
lizavéta
prókhorovna
she
had
come
to
the
solely
because
she
positively
did
not
know
where
to
lay
her
head
kiríllovna
ordered
the
samovár
to
be
prepared
for
a
long
time
avdótya
refused
to
drink
tea
but
yielded
at
last
to
the
entreaties
and
persuasions
of
all
the
maids
and
after
the
first
cup
drank
four
more
when
kiríllovna
perceived
that
her
visitor
was
somewhat
pacified
and
only
shuddered
from
time
to
time
sobbing
faintly
she
asked
her
whither
they
intended
to
remove
and
what
they
wished
to
do
with
their
things
this
question
set
avdótya
to
crying
again
and
she
began
to
asseverate
that
she
wanted
nothing
more
except
to
die
but
kiríllovna
being
a
woman
of
brains
immediately
stopped
her
and
advised
her
to
set
about
transferring
her
things
that
very
day
without
useless
waste
of
time
to
akím
former
cottage
in
the
village
where
dwelt
his
uncle
that
same
old
man
who
had
tried
to
dissuade
him
from
marrying
she
announced
that
with
the
mistress
permission
they
would
be
furnished
with
transportation
and
the
aid
of
people
and
horses
and
as
for
you
my
dearest
added
kiríllovna
compressing
her
lips
in
a
sour
smile
there
will
always
be
a
place
for
you
in
our
house
and
it
will
be
very
agreeable
to
us
if
you
will
be
our
guest
until
you
recover
yourself
and
get
settled
in
your
house
the
principal
thing
is
you
must
not
get
downcast
the
lord
gave
the
lord
has
taken
away
and
he
will
give
again
everything
depends
on
his
will
lizavéta
prókhorovna
of
course
was
obliged
to
sell
your
house
according
to
her
calculations
but
she
will
not
forget
you
and
will
reward
you
she
bade
me
say
so
to
akím
semyónitch
where
is
he
now
avdótya
replied
that
on
meeting
her
he
had
grossly
insulted
her
and
had
driven
off
to
chanter
efrém
to
that
creature
replied
kiríllovna
well
i
understand
that
it
is
painful
for
him
now
and
i
do
believe
you
can
hunt
him
up
what
is
to
be
done
we
must
take
measures
maláshka
she
added
turning
to
one
of
the
chambermaids
just
ask
nikanór
ílitch
to
step
here
i
will
have
a
talk
with
him
nikanór
ílitch
a
man
of
very
paltry
appearance
who
served
somewhat
in
the
capacity
of
overseer
immediately
presented
himself
obsequiously
listened
to
everything
which
kiríllovna
said
to
him
remarked
it
shall
be
executed
left
the
room
and
issued
his
orders
avdótya
was
furnished
with
three
carts
and
three
peasants
these
were
voluntarily
joined
by
a
fourth
who
said
of
himself
that
he
would
be
more
intelligent
than
they
and
she
set
off
in
company
with
them
for
the
inn
where
she
found
her
former
hired
men
and
her
fetínya
in
great
terror
and
excitement
naúm
recruits
three
extremely
robust
young
fellows
had
arrived
in
the
morning
and
had
gone
nowhere
since
but
had
maintained
a
very
zealous
guard
over
the
inn
according
to
naúm
promise
so
zealous
that
one
cart
speedily
proved
to
be
devoid
of
tires
bitter
very
bitter
was
it
for
poor
avdótya
to
pack
up
her
things
despite
the
assistance
of
the
intelligent
man
who
by
the
way
knew
how
to
do
nothing
but
stalk
about
with
a
staff
in
his
hand
and
watch
the
others
and
spit
to
one
side
she
did
not
succeed
in
moving
out
that
day
and
remained
to
spend
the
night
in
the
inn
having
first
requested
fetínya
not
to
leave
her
room
but
it
was
not
until
daybreak
that
she
fell
into
a
feverish
doze
and
the
tears
streamed
down
her
cheeks
even
in
her
sleep
in
the
meantime
efrém
awoke
earlier
than
was
his
wont
in
his
and
began
to
thump
and
demand
his
release
at
first
his
wife
would
not
let
him
out
declaring
to
him
through
the
door
that
he
had
not
yet
had
enough
sleep
but
he
excited
her
curiosity
by
promising
to
tell
her
about
the
remarkable
thing
which
had
happened
to
akím
she
undid
the
efrém
imparted
to
her
everything
he
knew
and
wound
up
with
the
question
was
he
awake
or
not
why
the
lord
knows
replied
his
wife
go
and
see
for
thyself
he
has
not
climbed
down
from
the
oven
you
both
got
pretty
drunk
last
night
thou
shouldst
just
see
thyself
thy
face
has
no
semblance
of
a
face
is
like
some
sort
of
ladle
and
what
a
lot
of
hay
has
got
into
thy
hair
never
mind
if
it
has
returned
efrém
and
passing
his
hand
over
his
head
he
entered
the
akím
was
no
longer
asleep
he
was
sitting
on
the
oven
with
his
legs
dangling
his
face
also
was
very
strange
and
discomposed
it
appeared
all
the
more
distorted
because
akím
was
not
in
the
habit
of
drinking
heavily
well
how
now
akím
semyónitch
how
have
you
slept
began
efrém
akím
looked
at
him
with
a
turbid
gaze
come
brother
efrém
he
said
hoarsely
ca
we
do
it
again
thou
knowest
what
efrém
darted
a
swift
glance
at
akím
at
that
moment
he
felt
a
sort
of
thrill
that
is
the
kind
of
sensation
a
sportsman
experiences
when
standing
on
the
skirt
of
the
woods
at
the
sudden
yelping
of
his
hound
in
the
forest
from
which
apparently
all
the
wild
beasts
have
already
fled
what
more
he
asked
at
last
yes
more
my
wife
will
see
thought
efrém
and
i
do
believe
she
will
allow
it
all
right
it
can
be
done
he
said
aloud
have
patience
he
went
out
and
thanks
to
artfully
conceived
measures
succeeded
in
smuggling
in
a
huge
bottle
unperceived
beneath
the
skirt
of
his
coat
akím
seized
the
bottle
but
efrém
did
not
start
to
drink
with
him
as
on
the
preceding
evening
he
was
afraid
of
his
wife
and
having
told
akím
that
he
would
go
and
see
how
things
were
progressing
at
his
house
and
how
his
belongings
were
being
packed
and
whether
he
were
not
being
robbed
he
immediately
set
off
for
the
inn
astride
of
his
unfed
little
nag
not
forgetting
himself
however
if
we
may
take
into
consideration
his
projecting
bosom
soon
after
his
departure
akím
fell
asleep
again
and
lay
like
one
dead
on
the
oven
he
did
not
even
wake
up
at
all
events
he
showed
no
signs
of
being
awake
when
efrém
returning
four
hours
later
began
to
shove
him
and
try
to
rouse
him
and
whisper
over
him
some
extremely
indistinct
words
to
the
effect
that
everything
was
gone
and
transported
and
the
holy
pictures
were
gone
too
and
everything
was
already
over
and
that
every
one
was
hunting
for
him
but
that
he
efrém
had
taken
due
measures
and
had
prohibited
and
so
forth
but
he
did
not
whisper
long
his
wife
led
him
off
to
the
again
and
herself
lay
down
in
the
house
on
the
platform
over
the
oven
in
great
indignation
at
her
husband
and
at
the
guest
thanks
to
whom
her
husband
had
got
drunk
but
when
on
awakening
very
early
according
to
her
wont
she
cast
a
glance
at
the
oven
akím
was
no
longer
on
it
the
cocks
had
not
yet
crowed
for
the
second
time
and
the
night
was
still
so
dark
that
the
sky
was
barely
turning
grey
directly
overhead
and
at
the
rim
was
still
completely
drowned
in
vapour
when
akím
emerged
from
the
gate
of
the
chanter
house
his
face
was
pale
but
he
darted
a
keen
glance
around
him
and
his
gait
did
not
betray
the
drunkard
he
walked
in
the
direction
of
his
former
dwelling
the
inn
which
had
already
definitively
become
the
property
of
its
new
owner
naúm
naúm
was
not
sleeping
either
at
the
time
when
akím
stealthily
quitted
efrém
house
he
was
not
asleep
he
was
lying
completely
dressed
on
the
with
his
sheepskin
coat
rolled
up
under
his
head
it
was
not
that
his
conscience
was
tormenting
him
no
he
had
been
present
with
astounding
from
the
morning
on
at
the
packing
and
transportation
of
akím
household
goods
and
had
more
than
once
spoken
to
avdótya
who
was
downcast
to
such
a
degree
that
she
did
not
even
upbraid
him
his
conscience
was
at
ease
but
divers
surmises
and
calculations
occupied
his
mind
he
did
not
know
whether
he
was
going
to
make
a
success
of
his
new
career
up
to
that
time
he
had
never
kept
an
inn
and
generally
speaking
had
never
even
had
a
nook
of
his
own
and
so
he
could
not
get
to
this
little
affair
has
been
begun
well
he
thought
what
will
the
future
be
when
the
last
of
akím
effects
had
set
off
just
before
avdótya
had
followed
it
weeping
he
had
inspected
the
entire
inn
all
the
stables
cellars
and
barns
he
had
crawled
up
into
the
attic
had
repeatedly
ordered
his
labourers
to
maintain
a
strict
watch
and
when
he
was
left
alone
after
supper
he
had
not
been
able
to
get
to
sleep
it
so
happened
that
on
that
day
none
of
the
travellers
stopped
to
pass
the
night
and
this
pleased
him
greatly
i
must
buy
a
dog
without
fail
the
dog
i
can
get
from
the
miller
for
they
have
carried
off
theirs
he
said
to
himself
as
he
tossed
from
side
to
side
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
raised
his
head
hastily
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
some
one
had
stolen
past
under
the
window
he
listened
not
a
sound
only
a
grasshopper
shrilled
behind
the
oven
from
time
to
time
and
a
mouse
was
gnawing
somewhere
and
his
own
breath
was
audible
all
was
still
in
the
empty
room
dimly
illuminated
by
the
yellow
rays
of
a
tiny
glass
which
he
had
found
time
to
suspend
and
light
in
front
of
a
small
holy
picture
in
the
corner
he
lowered
his
head
and
now
again
he
seemed
to
hear
the
gate
squeaking
then
the
wattled
hedge
crackled
faintly
he
could
not
endure
it
leaped
to
his
feet
opened
the
door
into
the
next
room
and
called
in
a
low
tone
feódor
hey
feódor
no
one
answered
him
he
went
out
into
the
anteroom
and
nearly
fell
prone
as
he
stumbled
over
feódor
who
was
sprawling
on
the
floor
the
labourer
stirred
growling
in
his
sleep
he
shook
him
who
there
what
wanted
feódor
was
beginning
what
art
thou
yelling
for
hold
thy
tongue
articulated
naúm
in
a
the
idea
of
your
sleeping
you
damned
brutes
hast
thou
not
heard
anything
no
replied
the
man
why
and
where
are
the
others
sleeping
the
others
are
sleeping
where
they
were
ordered
to
but
has
anything
happened
silence
follow
me
naúm
softly
opened
the
door
leading
from
the
anteroom
into
the
yard
out
of
doors
everything
was
very
dark
it
was
possible
to
make
out
the
sheds
with
their
pillars
only
because
they
stood
out
still
more
densely
black
in
the
midst
of
the
black
mist
i
light
a
lantern
said
feódor
in
a
low
voice
but
naúm
waved
his
hand
and
held
his
breath
at
first
he
could
hear
nothing
except
those
nocturnal
sounds
which
one
can
almost
always
hear
in
inhabited
places
a
horse
was
munching
oats
a
pig
grunted
once
faintly
in
its
sleep
a
man
was
snoring
somewhere
but
suddenly
there
reached
his
ear
a
suspicious
sort
of
noise
proceeding
from
the
extreme
end
of
the
yard
close
to
the
fence
it
seemed
as
though
some
one
was
moving
about
and
breathing
or
blowing
naúm
looked
over
feódor
shoulder
and
cautiously
descending
the
steps
walked
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
a
couple
of
times
he
halted
and
listened
then
continued
to
creep
stealthily
onward
suddenly
he
gave
a
start
ten
paces
from
him
in
the
dense
gloom
a
point
of
light
suddenly
glimmered
brightly
it
was
a
coal
and
beside
the
coal
there
showed
itself
for
a
brief
instant
the
front
part
of
some
one
face
with
lips
puffed
out
swiftly
and
silently
naúm
darted
at
the
light
as
a
cat
darts
at
a
mouse
hastily
rising
from
the
ground
a
long
body
rushed
to
meet
him
and
almost
knocked
him
from
his
feet
almost
slipped
through
his
hands
but
he
clung
to
it
with
all
his
might
feódor
andréi
petrúshka
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
come
here
quick
quick
i
caught
a
thief
an
incendiary
the
man
whom
he
had
captured
struggled
and
resisted
but
naúm
did
not
release
him
feódor
immediately
darted
to
his
assistance
a
lantern
quick
a
lantern
run
for
a
lantern
wake
the
others
be
quick
naúm
shouted
to
him
and
i
manage
him
alone
meanwhile
i
sit
on
him
be
quick
and
fetch
a
belt
to
bind
him
with
feódor
flew
to
the
cottage
the
man
whom
naúm
was
holding
suddenly
ceased
his
resistance
so
evidently
is
not
enough
for
thee
to
have
taken
my
wife
and
my
money
and
my
house
but
thou
art
bent
on
destroying
me
also
he
said
in
a
dull
tone
naúm
recognised
akím
voice
so
is
thou
dear
little
dove
said
he
good
just
wait
a
bit
let
me
go
said
art
not
thou
satisfied
see
here
i
show
you
in
the
presence
of
the
judge
how
satisfied
i
am
and
naúm
tightened
his
hold
on
akím
the
labourers
ran
up
with
two
lanterns
and
some
ropes
bind
him
ordered
naúm
sharply
the
labourers
seized
akím
lifted
him
up
and
bound
his
hands
behind
him
one
of
them
was
beginning
to
swear
but
on
recognising
the
former
landlord
of
the
inn
he
held
his
peace
and
merely
exchanged
glances
with
the
others
just
see
there
see
there
now
naúm
kept
repeating
the
while
as
he
passed
the
lantern
along
the
ground
yonder
there
are
coals
in
a
pot
just
look
he
has
brought
a
whole
firebrand
in
the
pot
we
must
find
out
where
he
got
that
pot
and
here
he
has
broken
twigs
and
naúm
assiduously
stamped
out
the
fire
with
his
search
him
feódor
he
added
and
see
whether
he
has
anything
more
about
him
feódor
searched
and
felt
akím
who
stood
motionless
with
his
head
drooping
on
his
breast
like
a
dead
there
is
here
a
knife
said
feódor
drawing
an
old
from
akím
breast
ehe
my
dear
fellow
so
that
what
thou
hadst
in
mind
exclaimed
you
are
witnesses
my
lads
see
there
he
intended
to
cut
my
throat
to
burn
up
my
house
lock
him
up
in
the
cellar
until
morning
he
ca
get
out
of
there
i
will
stand
watch
all
night
myself
and
at
dawn
we
will
take
him
to
the
chief
of
police
and
you
are
witnesses
do
you
hear
they
thrust
akím
into
the
cellar
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him
naúm
stationed
two
of
the
labourers
there
and
did
not
lie
down
to
sleep
himself
in
the
meantime
efrém
wife
having
convinced
herself
that
her
unbidden
guest
had
taken
himself
off
was
on
the
point
of
beginning
her
cooking
although
it
was
hardly
daylight
out
of
doors
as
yet
she
squatted
down
by
the
oven
to
get
some
coals
and
saw
that
some
one
had
already
raked
out
the
live
embers
thence
then
she
bethought
herself
of
her
knife
and
did
not
find
it
in
conclusion
one
of
her
four
pots
was
missing
efrém
wife
bore
the
reputation
of
being
anything
but
a
stupid
woman
and
with
good
reason
she
stood
for
a
while
in
thought
then
went
to
the
to
her
husband
it
was
not
easy
to
arouse
him
fully
and
still
more
difficult
was
it
to
make
him
understand
why
he
had
been
awakened
to
everything
which
his
wife
said
chanter
efrém
made
one
and
the
same
reply
he
gone
well
god
be
with
him
but
what
business
is
that
of
mine
he
has
carried
off
a
knife
and
a
pot
well
god
be
with
him
but
what
business
is
that
of
mine
but
at
last
he
rose
and
after
listening
intently
to
his
wife
he
decided
that
it
was
a
bad
business
and
that
it
could
not
be
left
as
it
now
stood
yes
the
chanter
wife
insisted
is
a
bad
business
i
do
believe
he
do
mischief
out
of
desperation
i
noticed
last
night
that
he
was
not
asleep
as
he
lay
there
on
the
oven
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
for
thee
efrém
alexándritch
to
find

feódorovna
and
having
fortified
himself
with
a
glass
of
liquor
efrém
set
out
for
the
inn
day
had
but
just
dawned
when
he
rode
up
to
the
inn
and
at
the
gate
a
cart
was
already
standing
harnessed
and
one
of
naúm
labourers
was
sitting
on
the
driver
seat
holding
the
reins
in
his
hands
whither

asked
him
to

replied
the
labourer
why
the
labourer
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
made
no
reply
efrém
sprang
from
his
horse
and
entered
the
house
in
the
anteroom
he
ran
across

following
him

approached

cellar
and
threw
the
door
wide
open

with
timorous
curiosity

his
neck
from
behind
naúm
back
and
with
difficulty
made
out
akím
in
one
corner
of
the
shallow
cellar
the
former
wealthy
householder
the
man
respected
in
all
the
countryside
was
sitting
with
pinioned
arms
on
the
straw
like
a
criminal
on
hearing
the
noise
he
raised
his
head
he
seemed
to
have
grown
frightfully
thin
in
the
last
two
days
especially
during
the
last
night
his
sunken
eyes
were
hardly
visible
beneath
his
lofty
brow
yellow
as
wax
his
parched
lips
had
turned
dark
his
whole
face
had
undergone
a
change
and
assumed
a
strange
expression
both
harsh
and
terrified
get

and
come

and
stepped
across
the
threshold
akím

the
labourer
on
the

who
could
see
everything
through
the
gate
merely
shook
his
head
and
slapped
the
reins
on
the
horse

on
the
porch
and

thou
wilt
not
be
in
debt
to
me
neither
shall
i
be
in
debt
to
thee
again
naúm
was
silent
for
a
space
well
take
thy
oath
on
that
i
do
as
god
is
holy
replied
akím
here
goes
then
although
i
know
beforehand
that
i
shall
repent
of
it
remarked
but
so
be
it
give
me
your
hands
akím
turned
his
back
toward
him
naúm
began
to
unbind
him
look
out
old
man
he
added
as
he
slipped
the
rope
over
his
wrists
remember
i
have
spared
thee
be
careful
you
a
dear
naúm
ivánitch
stammered
the
the
lord
will
be
merciful
to
you
akím
stretched
out
his
chilled
and
swollen
arms
and
was
starting
for
the
gate
all
of
a
sudden
naúm
turned
jewish
as
the
expression
is
evidently
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
released
akím
thou
hast
taken
an
oath
look
out
he
shouted
after
him
akím
turned
round
and
surveying
the
house
with
an
embracing
glance
said
sadly
possess
thou
everything
forever
undisturbed
farewell
and
he
stepped
quietly
into
the
street
accompanied
by
efrém
naúm
waved
his
hand
ordered
the
cart
to
be
unharnessed
and
went
back
into
the
house
whither
away
akím
semyónitch
art
not
thou
coming
to
my
house
exclaimed
efrém
perceiving
that
akím
turned
to
the
right
from
the
highway
no
efrémushka
thanks
replied
akím
i
will
go
and
see
what
my
wife
is
doing
thou
canst
see
later
on
but
now
thou
must
for
joy
thou
knowest
no
thanks
efrém
i
had
enough
as
it
is
farewell
and
akím
walked
away
without
looking
behind
him
eka
he
has
had
enough
as
it
is
ejaculated
the
astounded
chanter
and
i
have
taken
my
oath
on
his
behalf
well
i
did
expect
this
he
added
with
vexation
after
i
had
vouched
for
him
phew
he
remembered
that
he
had
forgotten
to
take
his
knife
and
pot
and
returned
to
the
inn
naúm
gave
orders
that
his
things
should
be
delivered
to
him
but
it
never
entered
his
head
to
entertain
him
thoroughly
enraged
and
completely
sober
he
presented
himself
at
home
well
what
his
wife
asked
him
didst
thou
find
him
did
i
find
him
retorted
efrém
certainly
i
found
him
there
are
thy
utensils
for
thee
akím
inquired
his
wife
with
special
emphasis
efrém
nodded
his
head
yes
akím
but
what
a
goose
he
is
i
went
bail
for
him
without
me
he
would
have
been
put
in
prison
and
he
never
even
treated
me
to
a
glass
of
liquor
ulyána
feódorovna
do
you
at
least
show
me
consideration
give
me
just
one
little
glass
but
ulyána
feódorovna
showed
him
no
consideration
and
drove
him
out
of
her
sight
in
the
meantime
akím
was
proceeding
with
quiet
strides
along
the
road
which
led
to
lizavéta
prókhorovna
village
he
had
not
yet
been
able
fully
to
recover
himself
he
was
all
quivering
inside
like
a
man
who
has
but
just
escaped
imminent
death
he
seemed
not
to
believe
in
his
freedom
with
dull
amazement
he
stared
at
the
fields
at
the
sky
at
the
larks
which
were
fluttering
their
wings
in
the
warm
air
on
the
previous
day
at
efrém
house
he
had
not
slept
at
all
since
dinner
although
he
had
lain
motionless
on
the
oven
at
first
he
had
tried
to
drown
with
liquor
the
intolerable
pain
of
injury
within
him
the
anguish
of
wrathful
impotent
indignation
but
the
liquor
could
not
entirely
overcome
him
his
heart
waxed
hot
within
him
and
he
began
to
meditate
how
he
might
pay
off
his
malefactor
he
thought
of
naúm
alone
lizavéta
prókhorovna
did
not
enter
his
head
and
from
avdótya
he
mentally
turned
away
toward
evening
the
thirst
for
revenge
had
blazed
up
in
him
to
the
point
of
crime
and
he
the
weak
man
with
feverish
impatience
waited
for
the
night
and
like
a
wolf
pouncing
on
its
prey
he
rushed
forth
with
fire
in
his
hand
to
annihilate
his
former
home
but
he
had
been
captured
locked
up
night
came
what
had
not
he
turned
over
in
his
mind
during
that
atrocious
night
it
is
difficult
to
convey
in
words
all
the
tortures
which
he
had
undergone
it
is
all
the
more
difficult
because
these
torments
even
in
the
man
himself
were
wordless
and
dumb
toward
morning
before
the
arrival
of
naúm
and
efrém
akím
had
felt
somewhat
easier
in
mind
everything
is
lost
he
thought
everything
is
scattered
to
the
winds
and
he
waved
his
hand
in
despair
over
everything
if
he
had
been
born
with
an
evil
soul
he
might
have
turned
into
a
criminal
at
that
moment
but
evil
was
not
a
characteristic
of
akím
beneath
the
shock
of
the
unexpected
and
undeserved
calamity
in
the
reek
of
despair
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
a
felonious
deed
it
had
shaken
him
to
the
very
foundations
and
having
miscarried
it
had
left
behind
in
him
a
profound
weariness
conscious
of
his
guilt
he
wrenched
his
heart
free
from
all
earthly
things
and
began
to
pray
bitterly
but
zealously
at
first
he
prayed
in
a
whisper
at
last
accidentally
perhaps
he
ejaculated
almost
aloud
o
lord
and
the
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
long
did
he
weep
then
calmed
down
at
last
his
thoughts
probably
would
have
undergone
a
change
had
he
been
forced
to
smart
for
his
attempt
of
the
day
before
but
now
he
had
suddenly
recovered
his
liberty
and
all
shattered
but
calm
he
was
on
his
way
to
an
interview
with
his
wife
lizavéta
prókhorovna
manor
stood
a
verst
and
a
half
distant
from
her
village
on
the
side
of
the
country
road
along
which
akím
was
walking
at
the
turn
which
led
to
the
manor
he
was
on
the
point
of
pausing
but
he
marched
past
he
had
decided
first
to
go
to
his
former
cottage
to
his
old
uncle
akím
tiny
and
already
rickety
cottage
was
situated
almost
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
village
akím
traversed
the
entire
length
of
the
street
without
encountering
a
single
soul
the
whole
population
was
in
church
only
one
ailing
old
woman
lifted
her
window
to
gaze
after
him
and
a
little
girl
who
had
run
out
to
the
well
with
an
empty
bucket
gaped
in
wonder
at
him
and
also
followed
him
with
her
eyes
the
first
person
whom
he
met
was
precisely
the
uncle
whom
he
was
seeking
the
old
man
had
been
sitting
since
early
morning
on
the
earthen
bank
outside
the
cottage
under
the
windows
taking
snuff
and
warming
himself
in
the
sun
he
was
not
quite
well
and
for
that
reason
had
not
gone
to
church
he
was
on
his
way
to
see
another
ailing
old
man
a
neighbour
when
he
suddenly
espied
akím
he
stopped
short
let
the
latter
come
up
to
him
and
looking
him
in
the
face
he
said
morning
akímushka
morning
replied
akím
and
stepping
past
the
old
man
he
entered
the
gate
to
his
cottage
in
the
yard
stood
his
horses
his
cow
his
cart
and
his
chickens
were
roaming
about
there
also
he
entered
the
cottage
in
silence
the
old
man
followed
him
akím
seated
himself
on
the
bench
and
rested
his
clenched
fists
on
it
the
old
man
gazed
compassionately
at
him
from
his
stand
at
the
door
and
where
is
my
housewife
inquired
akím
why
at
the
replied
the
old
man
briskly
she
is
there
they
have
placed
thy
cattle
here
and
thy
coffers
just
as
they
were
but
she
is
yonder
shall
i
go
for
her
akím
did
not
reply
immediately
yes
go
he
said
at
last
ekh
uncle
uncle
he
articulated
with
a
sigh
while
the
latter
was
taking
his
cap
from
its
nail
dost
thou
remember
what
thou
saidst
to
me
on
the
eve
of
my
wedding
god
will
rules
all
things
akímushka
dost
thou
remember
how
thou
saidst
to
me
that
i
was
no
fit
mate
for
you
peasants
and
now
see
what
a
pass
things
have
come
to
i
myself
have
become
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
a
man
ca
make
calculations
against
bad
people
replied
the
old
man
and
as
for
him
the
dishonest
scoundrel
if
any
one
were
to
teach
him
a
good
lesson
some
gentleman
for
instance
or
any
other
power
what
cause
would
there
be
to
fear
him
the
wolf
recognised
his
prey
and
the
old
man
put
on
his
cap
and
departed
avdótya
had
but
just
returned
from
church
when
she
was
informed
that
her
husband
uncle
was
inquiring
for
her
up
to
that
time
she
had
very
rarely
seen
him
he
had
not
been
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
their
inn
and
in
general
he
bore
the
reputation
of
being
a
queer
fellow
he
was
passionately
fond
of
snuff
and
preserved
silence
most
of
the
time
she
went
out
to
him
what
dost
thou
want
petróvitch
has
anything
happened
pray
nothing
has
happened
avdótya
aréfyevna
thy
husband
is
asking
for
thee
has
he
returned
yes
but
where
is
he
why
in
the
village
he
sitting
in
his
cottage
avdótya
quailed
well
petróvitch
she
asked
looking
him
straight
in
the
eye
is
he
angry
is
not
perceptible
that
he
is
avdótya
dropped
her
eyes
well
come
along
she
said
throwing
on
a
large
kerchief
and
the
two
set
out
they
walked
in
silence
until
they
reached
the
village
but
when
they
began
to
draw
near
to
the
cottage
avdótya
was
seized
with
such
alarm
that
her
knees
trembled
under
her
dear
little
father
petróvitch
she
said
do
thou
go
in
first
tell
him
that
i
have
come
petróvitch
entered
the
cottage
and
found
akím
sitting
buried
in
profound
thought
on
the
selfsame
spot
where
he
had
left
him
well
said
akím
raising
his
head
has
she
come
yes
she
has
come
replied
the
old
she
standing
at
the
gate
send
her
hither
the
old
man
went
out
waved
his
hand
to
avdótya
said
to
her
go
along
and
sat
down
again
himself
on
the
earthen
bank
along
the
cottage
wall
with
trepidation
avdótya
opened
the
door
crossed
the
threshold
and
paused
akím
looked
at
her
well
aréfyevna
he
began
what
are
we
thou
and
i
to
do
now
forgive
me
she
whispered
ekh
aréfyevna
we
are
all
sinful
folks
what
the
use
of
discussing
it
that
villain
has
ruined
both
of
us
began
avdótya
in
a
voice
which
jingled
and
broke
and
the
tears
streamed
down
her
thou
must
not
let
things
stand
as
they
are
akím
semyónitch
thou
must
get
the
money
from
him
do
not
spare
me
i
am
ready
to
declare
under
oath
that
i
lent
the
money
to
him
lizavéta
prókhorovna
had
a
right
to
sell
our
house
but
why
should
he
rob
us
get
the
money
from
him
i
have
no
money
to
receive
from
him
replied
akím
he
and
i
have
settled
our
accounts
avdótya
was
how
so
why
because
we
have
knowest
thou
pursued
akím
and
his
eyes
began
to
blaze
knowest
thou
where
i
spent
the
night
thou
dost
not
know
in
naúm
cellar
bound
hand
and
foot
like
a
ram
that
where
i
spent
last
night
i
tried
to
burn
down
his
house
and
he
caught
me
did
naúm
he
awfully
clever
and
he
was
preparing
to
carry
me
to
the
town
but
he
pardoned
me
consequently
there
is
no
money
coming
to
me
from
him
when
did
i
ever
borrow
any
money
of
thee
he
will
say
and
am
i
to
say
wife
took
it
out
from
under
my
floor
and
carried
it
to
thee
wife

a
liar
he
will
say
and
would
it
be
a
big
exposure
for
thee
aréfyevna
hold
thy
tongue
rather
i
tell
thee
hold
thy
tongue
forgive
me
semyónitch
forgive
me
whispered
the
thoroughly
frightened
avdótya
that
not
the
point
replied
akím
after
remaining
silent
for
a
while
but
what
are
we
thou
and
i
to
do
we
no
longer
have
a
home
nor
money
either
we
get
along
somehow
akím
semyónitch
we
will
ask
lizavéta
prókhorovna
and
she
will
help
us
kiríllovna
has
promised
me
that
no
aréfyevna
thou
mayest
ask
her
for
thyself
along
with
thy
kiríllovna
thou
and
she
are
birds
of
a
feather
but
i
tell
thee
what
do
thou
stay
here
with
god
blessing
i
shall
not
stay
here
luckily
we
have
no
children
and
perhaps
i
shall
not
starve
alone
one
person
can
worry
along
alone
what
wilt
thou
do
semyónitch
dost
mean
to
go
as
carrier
again
akím
laughed
bitterly
a
pretty
carrier
i
would
make
there
no
denying
that
a
fine
dashing
young
fellow
thou
hast
picked
out
no
aréfyevna
that
is
not
the
same
sort
of
business
as
marrying
for
example
an
old
man
is
not
fit
for
it
only
i
will
not
remain
here
that
what
i
wo
have
people
pointing
the
finger
at
me
understand
i
shall
go
to
pray
away
my
sins
aréfyevna
that
where
i
shall
go
what
sins
hast
thou
semyónitch
articulated
avdótya
timidly
well
wife
i
know
what
they
are
but
in
whose
care
wilt
thou
leave
me
semyónitch
how
am
i
to
live
without
a
husband
in
whose
care
shall
i
leave
thee
ekh
aréfyevna
how
thou
sayest
that
forsooth
much
need
hast
thou
of
a
husband
like
me
and
an
old
man
and
a
ruined
one
to
boot
the
idea
thou
has
dispensed
with
me
before
thou
canst
dispense
with
me
hereafter
also
and
what
property
we
have
left
thou
mayest
take
for
thyself
curse
it
as
thou
wilt
semyónitch
replied
avdótya
sadly
thou
knowest
best
about
that
exactly
so
only
do
think
that
i
am
angry
with
thee
aréfyevna
no
what
the
use
of
being
angry
when
i
ought
to
have
discovered
how
things
stood
earlier
in
the
day
i
myself
am
to
blame
and
i
am
punished
akím
heaved
a
sigh
as
you
have
made
your
bed
so
you
must
lie
upon
it
i
am
advanced
in
years
and
is
time
for
me
to
be
thinking
of
my
soul
the
lord
himself
has
brought
me
to
my
senses
here
was
i
seest
thou
an
old
fool
who
wanted
to
live
at
his
ease
with
a
young
wife
no
brother
old
man
first
do
thou
pray
and
beat
thy
brow
against
the
earth
and
be
patient
and
fast
and
now
go
my
mother
i
am
very
tired
and
i
will
get
a
bit
of
sleep
and
akím
stretched
himself
out
grunting
on
the
bench
avdótya
started
to
say
something
stood
for
a
while
gazing
at
him
then
turned
and
went
away
well
did
he
thrash
thee
petróvitch
asked
her
as
he
sat
all
bent
double
on
the
earthen
bank
when
she
came
alongside
of
him
avdótya
passed
him
in
see
there
now
he
did
beat
her
said
the
old
man
to
himself
as
he
grinned
ruffled
up
his
hair
and
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
akím
carried
out
his
purpose
he
speedily
put
his
petty
affairs
in
order
and
a
few
days
after
the
conversation
which
we
have
transcribed
he
went
already
garbed
for
the
journey
to
bid
farewell
to
his
wife
who
had
settled
for
the
time
being
in
a
tiny
wing
of
the
their
did
not
last
long
kiríllovna
who
chanced
to
be
on
hand
advised
akím
to
present
himself
to
the
mistress
and
he
did
so
lizavéta
prókhorovna
received
him
with
a
certain
amount
of
confusion
but
affably
permitted
him
to
kiss
her
hand
and
inquired
where
he
was
intending
to
betake
himself
he
replied
that
he
was
going
first
to
kíeff
and
thence
wherever
god
should
grant
she
lauded
his
purpose
and
dismissed
him
from
that
time
forth
he
rarely
made
his
appearance
at
home
although
he
never
forgot
to
bring
his
mistress
a
blessed
bread
with
a
particle
taken
out
for
her
health
but
on
the
other
hand
everywhere
where
devout
russians
congregate
his
gaunt
and
aged
but
still
comely
and
sedate
face
was
to
be
seen
at
the
shrine
of
sergius
and
on
the
white
shores
and
in
the
óptin
hermitage
and
in
distant
valaám
he
went
everywhere
this
year
he
passed
you
in
the
ranks
of
the
countless
throng
which
marched
in
a
procession
of
the
cross
behind
the
holy
picture
of
the
of
god
at
the
korennáya
hermitage
next
year
you
would
find
him
sitting
with
his
wallet
on
his
back
along
with
other
pilgrims
on
the
porch
of
nicholas
the
in
mtzensk
he
made
his
appearance
in
moscow
nearly
every
spring
from
place
to
place
he
trudged
with
his
quiet
unhurried
but
unceasing
stride
is
said
that
he
even
went
to
jerusalem
he
appeared
to
be
perfectly
composed
and
happy
and
many
persons
talked
about
his
piety
and
humility
especially
those
people
who
had
chanced
to
converse
with
him
in
the
meanwhile
naúm
affairs
throve
exceedingly
he
took
hold
briskly
and
understandingly
and
as
the
saying
is
went
to
the
head
fast
everybody
in
the
neighbourhood
knew
by
what
means
he
had
acquired
possession
of
the
inn
and
they
knew
also
that
avdótya
had
given
him
her
husband
money
no
one
liked
naúm
because
of
his
cold
and
harsh
character
they
narrated
with
condemnation
concerning
him
that
one
day
he
had
replied
to
akím
himself
who
had
begged
alms
under
his
window
god
will
provide
and
had
brought
out
nothing
to
him
but
all
agreed
that
no
more
lucky
man
than
he
existed
his
grain
throve
better
than
his
neighbours
grain
his
bees
swarmed
more
abundantly
even
his
hens
laid
more
eggs
his
cattle
never
fell
ill
his
horses
never
went
lame
for
a
long
time
avdótya
could
not
endure
to
hear
his
name
she
had
accepted
lizavéta
prókhorovna
offer
and
had
again
entered
her
service
in
the
capacity
of
but
eventually
her
aversion
diminished
somewhat
was
said
that
want
forced
her
to
have
recourse
to
him
and
he
gave
her
a
hundred
rubles
we
shall
not
condemn
her
too
severely
poverty
will
break
any
one
spirit
and
the
sudden
revolution
in
her
life
had
aged
and
tamed
her
down
greatly
it
is
difficult
to
believe
how
quickly
she
lost
her
good
looks
how
she
grew
disheartened
and
and
how
did
it
all
end
the
reader
will
ask
thus
naúm
after
having
conducted
his
business
successfully
for
fifteen
years
sold
his
inn
on
profitable
terms
to
a
petty
burgher
he
never
would
have
parted
with
his
house
if
the
following
apparently
insignificant
incident
had
not
occurred
two
mornings
in
succession
his
dog
as
it
sat
in
front
of
the
windows
howled
in
a
prolonged
and
mournful
manner
on
the
second
occasion
he
went
out
into
the
street
gazed
attentively
at
the
howling
dog
shook
his
head
set
off
for
the
town
and
that
very
day
agreed
on
the
price
with
a
petty
burgher
who
had
long
been
trying
to
purchase
his
inn
a
week
later
he
departed
for
some
distant
place
out
of
the
government
and
what
think
you
that
very
night
the
inn
was
burned
to
the
ground
not
even
a
kennel
remained
intact
and
naúm
successor
was
reduced
to
beggary
the
reader
can
easily
imagine
what
rumours
arose
in
the
neighbourhood
concerning
this
conflagration
evidently
he
carried
his
luck
away
with
him
all
declared
it
is
reported
that
he
engaged
in
the
grain
business
and
became
very
wealthy
but
was
it
for
long
other
equally
firm
pillars
have
fallen
prone
and
sooner
or
later
a
bad
deed
has
a
bad
ending
it
is
not
worth
while
to
say
much
about
lizavéta
prókhorovna
she
is
alive
to
this
day
and
as
often
happens
with
people
of
that
sort
she
has
not
changed
in
the
least
she
has
not
even
aged
much
but
only
seems
to
have
grown
more
lean
moreover
her
penuriousness
has
increased
to
an
extreme
degree
although
it
is
difficult
to
understand
for
whom
she
is
always
hoarding
since
she
has
no
children
and
is
related
to
no
one
in
conversation
she
frequently
alludes
to
akím
and
avers
that
ever
since
she
discovered
all
his
fine
qualities
she
has
come
to
cherish
a
great
respect
for
the
russian
peasant
kiríllovna
has
purchased
her
freedom
from
lizavéta
prókhorovna
for
a
considerable
sum
and
has
married
for
love
some
young
butler
or
other
at
whose
hands
she
endures

as

wing
of
