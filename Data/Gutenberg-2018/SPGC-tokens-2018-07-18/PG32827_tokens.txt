you
never
read
a
johnny
mayhem
story
before
you
are
in
for
a
treat
johnny
who
wears
different
bodies
the
way
ordinary
people
wear
clothes
is
one
of
the
most
fascinating
series
characters
in
science
when
he
reached
ophiuchus
johnny
mayhem
was
wearing
the
body
of
an
elderly
sirian
gentleman
nothing
could
have
been
more
incongruous
the
sirian
wore
a
a
dignified
jumper
in
a
charcoal
color
sedate
boots
and
a
black
the
loiterers
in
the
street
near
the
galactic
observer
building
looked
and
pointed
and
laughed
using
the
dignity
of
the
dead
sirian
whose
body
he
wore
like
other
people
wear
clothing
johnny
mayhem
ignored
them
they
had
a
point
of
course
it
was
hot
and
humid
on
ophiuchus
ix
the
loiterers
in
the
dusty
streets
wore
nothing
but
loin
cloths
mayhem
went
inside
the
building
which
was
probably
it
was
the
only
structure
on
the
entire
planet
mayhem
dabbed
at
his
sirian
forehead
gratefully
mopping
at
sweat
as
near
as
he
could
figure
his
life
expectancy
in
this
body
was
down
to
three
days
earth
style
he
wondered
fleetingly
why
the
galactic
league
had
sent
him
here
to
ophiuchus
he
shrugged
knowing
he
would
find
out
soon
enough
the
galactic
observer
on
ophiuchus
ix
a
indian
from
bombay
named
kovandaswamy
wore
an
immaculate
white
linen
loin
cloth
on
his
plump
body
and
a
relieved
smile
on
his
worried
face
when
mayhem
entered
his
office
the
two
men
shook
hands
so
you
mayhem
kovandaswamy
said
in
english
they
told
me
to
expect
you
sir
pardon
my
staring
but
i
never
been
face
to
face
with
a
legend
before
i
impressed
mayhem
laughed
you
get
over
it
well
at
least
as
a
sirian
gentleman
you
not
very
prepossessing
that
helps
it
was
my
idea
it
never
is
i
know
i
know
that
sir
kovandaswamy
got
up
nervously
from
his
desk
and
paced
across
the
room
do
you
know
anything
about
ophiuchus
ix
mayhem
not
much
it
one
of
the
forgotten
worlds
is
it
precisely
sir
ophiuchus
ix
is
one
of
scores
of
interstellar
worlds
colonized
in
the
first
great
outflux
from
earth
you
mean
during
the
population
pressure
of
the
century
exactly
then
ophiuchus
ix
like
the
other
forgotten
worlds
was
all
but
forgotten
as
you
know
mayhem
the
first
flux
of
colonization
receded
like
a
wave
inertia
set
in
and
the
forgotten
worlds
became
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
galaxy
for
generations
only
in
the
past
fifty
years
are
we
finding
them
again
one
by
one
ophiuchus
ix
is
typical
isolated
from
the
galaxy
at
large
by
a
dust
cloud
that
i
know
i
came
through
it
it
was
colonized
originally
with
indians
from
southern
and
eastern
india
on
earth
that
why
the
galactic
league
appointed
me
observer
i
an
indian
these
people
well
they
what
my
people
might
have
developed
into
if
they
lived
for
hundreds
of
years
in
perfect
isolation
what
the
trouble
kovandaswamy
answered
with
a
question
of
his
own
you
are
aware
of
the
galactic
league
chief
aim
sure
to
see
that
no
outworld
however
small
or
distant
is
left
in
isolation
is
that
what
you
mean
yes
agreed
kovandaswamy
their
reason
is
obvious
for
almost
a
thousand
years
now
the
human
race
has
outpaced
its
social
and
moral
development
with
development
in
the
physical
sciences
for
almost
a
thousand
years
mankind
has
had
the
power
to
destroy
itself
in
isolation
this
is
possible
with
mutual
interchange
of
ideas
it
is
extremely
unlikely
thus
in
the
interests
of
human
survival
the
galactic
league
tries
to
thwart
isolated
development
so
far
the
forgotten
worlds
have
cooperated
but
ophiuchus
ix
is
an
exception
and
the
league
wants
me
to
find
out
why
precisely
how
are
they
thwarting
kovandaswamy
was
sweating
despite
the
despite
his
state
you
have
the
right
to
turn
this
mission
down
of
course
the
league
told
me
that
i
here
mayhem
said
simply
very
well
sir
sooner
or
later
every
outworlder
who
ventures
out
among
the
ophiuchans
kills
himself
i
guess
i
did
hear
you
did
you
say
kills
himself
suicide
mayhem
exactly
but
how
can
you
blame
like
their
ancestors
from
the
earthian
of
india
mayhem
the
ophiuchans
are
mystics
the
trance
the
holy
man
who
sits
in
contemplation
of
his
navel
the
world
spirit
these
are
the
things
of
their
culture
most
important
to
them
mayhem
did
you
ever
see
a
hundred
holy
men
of
india
working
together
usually
they
do
work
together
precisely
sir
precisely
here
on
ophiuchus
they
do
and
not
merely
a
hundred
all
of
them
virtually
all
of
them
working
together
their
minds
in
trance
unified
seeking
their
world
spirit
they
can
do
amazing
things
like
mentally
forcing
the
outworlders
to
kill
themselves
yes
sir
legally
they
are
innocent
morally
they
do
not
recognize
the
outworlders
as
equals
of
themselves
the
league
wants
to
know
what
they
are
trying
to
hide
it
could
be
a
threat
to
peace
and
existence
you
have
a
body
for
me
johnny
would
be
ready
with
that
provided
if
anyone
but
johnny
mayhem
had
asked
that
question
kovandaswamy
would
not
have
known
what
he
was
talking
about
or
would
have
thought
him
insane
or
both
but
johnny
mayhem
was
of
course
the
legandary
man
without
a
body
how
many
corporeal
shells
had
he
inhabited
in
the
past
half
dozen
years
he
shrugged
not
remembering
he
could
remain
in
one
body
more
than
a
month
it
would
mean
the
final
death
of
his
his
bodiless
sentience
so
far
he
had
avoided
that
death
the
galactic
league
would
help
him
if
it
could
every
world
which
had
a
human
population
and
a
galactic
league
post
however
small
must
have
a
body
in
cold
storage
waiting
for
johnny
mayhem
if
his
services
were
required
but
no
one
knew
exactly
under
what
circumstances
the
galactic
league
council
operating
from
the
hub
of
the
galaxy
might
summon
mayhem
and
only
a
very
few
people
including
those
at
the
hub
and
the
galactic
league
firstmen
on
civilized
worlds
and
observers
on
primitive
worlds
knew
the
precise
mechanism
of
mayhem
coming
to
others
it
was
a
weird
mystery
johnny
mayhem
bodiless
sentience
mayhem
johnny
marlow
then
who
had
been
chased
from
earth
a
pariah
and
a
criminal
almost
seven
years
ago
who
had
been
mortally
wounded
on
a
wild
planet
deep
within
the
saggitarian
swarm
whose
life
had
been
saved
after
a
fashion
by
the
white
magic
of
the
planet
mayhem
doomed
now
to
possible
immortality
as
a
bodiless
sentience
an
which
could
occupy
and
activate
a
fresh
corpse
or
one
which
had
been
frozen
properly
an
doomed
to
wander
eternally
because
it
could
not
remain
in
one
body
for
more
than
a
month
without
body
and
perishing
mayhem
who
had
dedicated
his
strange
lonely
life
to
the
service
of
the
galactic
league
because
a
normal
life
and
normal
social
relations
were
not
possible
for
him
then
you
do
it
kovandaswamy
asked
on
ophiuchus
ix
even
though
you
realize
we
can
give
you
no
official
help
not
only
because
the
galactic
league
approves
of
your
work
unofficially
but
ca
sanction
it
officially
but
because
an
outworlder
ca
set
his
foot
outside
this
building
for
long
or
off
the
spacefield
without
risking
death
by
suicide
yes
i
practically
a
prisoner
in
galactic
league
headquarters
as
is
my
staff
you
see
what
about
the
body
kovandaswamy
looked
at
him
nervously
a
native
mayhem
a
native
be
molested
you
see
that
figures
what
kind
of
native
in
top
shape
sir
healthy
young
in
the
prime
of
life
you
might
say
then
what
bothering
you
nothing
nothing
sir
your
technicians
are
ready
yes
sir
and
vowed
to
secrecy
mayhem
found
a
tiny
capsule
in
the
pocket
of
his
sirian
jumper
and
popped
it
in
his
mouth
what
what
that
kovandaswamy
asked
mayhem
swallowed
curare
he
said
curare
a
poison
paralysis
said
mayhem
quickly
muscular
paralysis
you
die
because
you
stop
breathing
painless
and
but
call
your
technicians
new
body
ready
gasping
the
sirian
gentleman
hardly
johnny
mayhem
now
fell
to
the
floor
trembling
kovandaswamy
pressed
a
button
on
his
desk
a
few
moments
later
two
technicians
entered
the
office
project
m
kovandaswamy
said
grimly
the
technicians
went
to
work
mayhem
awoke
ordinarily
it
was
his
alone
which
journeyed
between
the
worlds
his
which
was
fed
the
information
it
would
need
in
while
the
frozen
body
was
thawed
out
sometimes
however
he
came
the
normal
way
in
a
body
which
still
had
some
of
its
thirty
days
left
as
he
had
come
to
ophiuchus
ix
in
the
sirian
gentleman
darkness
the
body
felt
young
and
healthy
mayhem
wondered
vaguely
how
it
had
died
then
decided
it
did
not
really
matter
for
the
next
thirty
days
the
body
would
live
again
as
johnny
mayhem
recessed
lighting
glowed
at
the
juncture
of
walls
and
ceiling
mayhem
was
reclining
on
a
cot
a
loin
cloth
and
a
large
shawl
had
been
laid
out
for
him
on
the
far
wall
of
the
room
was
a
tinted
mirror
mayhem
got
up
and
went
over
there
what
his
new
body
looked
like
hardly
mattered
he
told
himself
youth
health
strength
these
were
important
he
could
sense
them
internally
he
could
he
stared
at
the
image
in
the
mirror
his
face
turned
beet
red
he
went
for
the
shawl
and
the
loin
cloth
and
put
them
on
cursing
he
went
to
find
kovandaswamy
is
this
supposed
to
be
a
joke
mayhem
demanded
you
never
asked
what
the
kovandaswamy
began
how
am
i
supposed
to
find
out
anything
like
this
it
a
young
body
a
healthy
body
it
is
also
the
one
we
were
given
when
the
galactic
league
first
came
here
it
is
the
only
one
we
were
given
take
it
or
leave
it
eh
i
afraid
so
mayhem
all
right
all
right
i
guess
i
should
complain
it
could
probably
outrun
and
outfight
and
outthink
the
dyspeptic
old
sirian
gentleman
and
things
turned
out
well
enough
on
sirius
iii
but
it
probably
take
most
of
my
time
just
getting
used
to
it
kovandaswamy
i
supposed
to
be
conducting
an
investigation
at
least
as
an
ophiuchan
you
wo
arouse
suspicion
mayhem
nodded
slowly
with
reluctance
there
was
nothing
else
to
say
he
shook
hands
with
kovandaswamy
and
wearing
the
loin
cloth
and
the
shawl
left
the
galactic
league
building
with
of
course
a
completely
new
identity
mayhem
walked
a
mile
and
a
half
through
hot
arid
country
the
league
building
was
isolated
as
if
its
inmates
might
contaminate
the
native
ophiuchans
along
the
dusty
road
mayhem
passed
a
the
name
for
a
wise
man
or
a
holy
man
first
in
india
and
now
here
on
ophiuchus
ix
the
guru
sat
in
contemplation
of
the
tip
of
his
nose
legs
crossed
soles
of
feet
up
eyes
the
guru
remained
that
way
without
moving
until
mayhem
was
out
of
sight
then
the
guru
behaved
in
a
very
manner
the
guru
got
up
quite
nimbly
joints
creaking
skin
dry
and
cracked
three
strides
brought
him
to
a
tree
with
a
partly
hollow
trunk
he
lifted
a
radio
transmitter
and
began
to
talk
in
twenty
generations
the
initially
small
population
of
ophiuchus
ix
all
colonists
from
india
on
earth
had
increased
geometrically
the
colonized
planet
now
was
as
as
the
teeming
which
long
ago
had
sent
the
colonists
seeking
a
new
home
as
a
result
unemployment
was
chronic
discontent
widespread
and
whatever
inner
serenity
mysticism
might
bring
was
widely
sought
after
this
did
not
stop
the
however
of
whom
there
were
many
from
seeking
jobs
that
could
pay
money
that
could
fill
empty
bellies
illustration
the
crazed
mob
was
bent
upon
rapine
and
murder
a
long
line
gathered
outside
the
employment
office
of
denebian
exports
the
morning
after
mayhem
had
left
the
league
building
in
his
new
body
denebian
exports
was
the
largest
outworld
company
currently
on
ophiuchus
a
company
which
had
solved
the
problem
quite
simply
by
hiring
no
one
but
natives
still
hoots
and
catcalls
surrounded
those
on
the
employment
line
other
jobless
ophiuchans
apparently
preferring
to
working
for
the
outworlders
threatened
to
make
the
situation
dangerous
pandit
gandhi
menon
a
lean
handsome
ophiuchan
of
perhaps
thirty
years
wished
there
was
some
way
he
could
shut
his
ears
to
the
abuse
he
needed
work
his
father
and
mother
were
ill
his
child
was
starving
his
wife
already
dead
the
gurus
offered
their
own
unique
solution
of
course
the
body
is
nothing
they
said
the
mind
is
everything
but
thus
had
the
gurus
spoken
for
four
thousand
years
on
earth
and
on
ophiuchus
the
great
majority
of
ophiuchans
pandit
gandhi
menon
included
preferred
food
for
the
body
to
food
for
mystic
thought
still
the
crowds
were
ugly
threatening
to
break
up
the
line
of
if
denebian
exports
did
open
its
doors
soon
an
unkempt
little
man
not
old
but
with
a
matted
growth
of
beard
an
unwashed
body
which
gave
the
impression
of
wiry
strength
and
wild
eyes
abruptly
flung
himself
at
the
young
woman
in
line
in
front
of
pandit
shouting
not
our
women
too
the
little
man
attacked
the
girl
trying
to
drag
her
from
the
line
it
is
bad
enough
our
men
but
not
our
women
pandit
caught
the
fanatic
wiry
arm
and
brought
it
behind
his
scrawny
back
in
a
hammerlock
leave
her
alone
he
said
if
you
try
that
again
i
break
your
arm
the
fanatic
looked
at
pandit
with
hate
in
his
eyes
but
stepped
back
and
stood
to
one
side
mouthing
invective
the
girl
who
was
about
years
old
had
a
livid
mark
on
her
arm
she
wore
loin
cloth
and
shawl
the
usual
garb
she
was
pandit
observed
for
the
first
time
quite
pretty
thank
you
she
said
i
i
not
sure
i
like
working
for
the
outworlders
but
i
need
the
money
do
we
all
pandit
told
her
but
we
not
hired
yet
i
am
pandit
gandhi
menon
sria
krishna
the
girl
said
smiling
at
him
what
sort
of
work
is
it
do
you
know
sria
krishna
the
girl
shook
her
head
and
pandit
said
actually
i
guess
i
know
either
but
there
are
rumors
the
outworlders
want
not
for
rocketry
for
jets
to
fly
to
the
empty
places
the
empty
places
why
pandit
shrugged
because
they
are
empty
perhaps
because
they
are
too
dry
and
too
arid
to
support
life
because
denebian
export
can
claim
whatever
it
found
there
for
free
export
so
go
the
rumors
but
surely
you
ca
pilot
a
jet
can
you
yes
pandit
said
promptly
with
a
faint
show
of
pride
my
father
taught
me
i
want
to
thank
you
for
what
nothing
anyone
in
my
position
would
have
done
it
this
rabble
the
rabble
was
still
noisy
occasionally
they
hurled
offal
at
the
stragglers
joining
the
rear
of
the
long
line
but
pandit
and
sria
krishna
stood
in
the
forefront
and
presently
the
door
opened
in
a
few
minutes
pandit
watched
the
girl
disappear
inside
he
waited
nervously
licking
dry
lips
with
a
parched
tongue
it
was
early
morning
but
already
very
hot
he
needed
the
work
any
work
he
needed
the
money
which
outworlders
could
pay
so
abundantly
for
honest
work
he
wondered
if
the
fanatic
gurus
ever
thought
of
that
then
the
door
in
front
of
him
opened
again
and
a
fat
ophiuchan
came
out
he
seemed
to
be
an
official
of
sorts
one
more
he
said
only
one
the
rest
of
you
begone
behind
pandit
there
was
a
general
press
of
bodies
but
he
was
first
in
line
and
did
not
surrender
his
position
the
man
admitted
him
a
bribe
pandit
passed
him
by
he
have
a
single
copper
he
approached
a
desk
the
crowd
noise
outside
was
loud
those
who
had
not
joined
the
line
crowing
because
most
of
those
on
it
had
been
turned
away
behind
the
desk
sat
a
small
denebian
man
of
middle
years
he
looked
nervous
can
you
fly
he
asked
in
a
voice
almost
desperately
thin
yes
pandit
said
then
the
rumors
were
right
how
much
experience
five
years
on
and
off
you
have
a
license
there
are
no
licenses
on
ophiuchus
ix
pandit
pointed
out
yes
of
course
i
sorry
habit
you
people
do
lie
we
try
not
to
your
name
pandit
told
him
the
denebian
wrote
it
down
on
a
form
and
said
do
pay
is
twenty
credits
a
mission
it
was
much
but
it
was
more
than
pandit
had
expected
what
do
we
fly
he
asked
questions
did
seem
welcome
but
no
harm
trying
the
denebian
looked
at
him
and
laughed
you
want
the
job
yes
i
want
the
job
then
do
ask
questions
pandit
nodded
out
through
that
door
then
the
other
new
pilots
are
assembling
and
pandit
left
the
small
office
a
moment
later
a
buzzer
sounded
on
the
denebian
desk
he
spoke
into
a
grid
orkap
here
go
ahead
the
guru
near
the
league
building
reports
that
a
native
ophiuchan
left
the
building
heading
for
the
city
when
was
this
yesterday
morning
and
draw
your
own
conclusions
natives
do
go
near
the
league
headquarters
as
a
rule
do
they
no
and
the
league
of
course
will
want
to
know
about
the
suicides
yes
but
but
nothing
said
the
radio
voice
which
belonged
to
the
only
other
denebian
currently
on
ophiuchus
ix
we
can
assume
this
native
is
a
spy
for
the
league
orkap
all
right
i
do
see
any
need
to
worry
though
do
you
the
gurus
like
the
other
natives
can
sham
but
they
lie
sooner
or
later
a
guru
will
be
brought
out
of
trance
by
the
league
questioned
and
tell
them
about
us
orkap
asked
in
a
shocked
voice
it
could
happen
maybe
it
happened
already
there
wo
be
any
proof
of
course
but
the
league
would
send
a
spy
suppose
i
describe
this
native
to
you
orkap
said
go
ahead
and
the
radio
voice
did
so
in
a
shocked
voice
orkap
admitted
i
given
that
ophiuchan
a
job
this
morning
there
ca
be
any
doubt
about
it
ah
then
you
see
you
see
i
can
fix
that
i
can
orkap
orkap
you
do
nothing
now
let
the
spy
alone
for
now
then
in
the
empty
places
you
will
merely
announce
to
the
pilots
that
there
is
a
spy
among
them
do
reveal
who
it
is
he
could
not
believe
his
ears
but
they
want
work
they
need
work
they
all
be
afraid
the
finger
of
guilt
may
point
at
them
they
work
like
dogs
for
you
and
i
be
surprised
if
they
uncovered
the
spy
themselves
yes
orkap
said
yes
i
understand
all
but
one
thing
orkap
there
is
one
thing
you
do
understand
the
spy
identity
you
already
told
me
who
the
spy
was
yes
but
there
is
another
spy
working
for
us
in
the
league
building
i
never
knew
said
orkap
the
spy
among
your
pilots
is
more
than
appearance
indicates
did
you
ever
hear
of
johnny
mayhem
orkap
heart
jumped
into
his
throat
who
in
the
galaxy
had
heard
of
mayhem
but
he
gasped
a
nevertheless
it
is
mayhem
orkap
was
suddenly
afraid
more
afraid
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
the
ubiquitous
mayhem
the
fierce
white
sun
of
ophiuchus
ix
broiled
down
on
the
empty
places
a
featureless
desert
miles
across
and
as
lividly
white
as
bleached
bone
in
all
that
burning
emptiness
the
jet
cargo
craft
looked
very
small
and
very
insignificant
like
black
midges
on
the
dead
white
sand
midges
among
midges
the
new
pilots
walked
one
said
but
i
see
no
cargo
another
these
outworlders
and
their
mystery
all
were
sweating
all
uncomfortable
but
all
grateful
for
the
twenty
credits
a
flight
they
would
earn
whatever
the
cargo
turned
out
to
be
what
do
you
think
pandit
asked
sria
i
think
i
never
been
so
hot
in
my
life
i
feel
like
i
being
broiled
alive
here
comes
the
denebian
now
they
had
been
driven
into
the
empty
places
in
a
sand
sled
the
trip
had
taken
two
days
but
because
the
sled
was
no
one
had
objected
when
they
saw
the
half
dozen
jets
they
knew
why
a
sled
had
taken
them
into
the
wilderness
the
jets
were
small
with
room
for
pilot
and
perhaps
a
ton
of
cargo
in
each
whatever
it
was
the
denebians
wanted
exported
it
did
take
up
much
room
orkap
of
deneb
walked
toward
them
past
the
first
of
the
jets
he
began
without
preamble
your
cargo
is
packed
and
ready
to
be
moved
in
an
underground
vault
five
hundred
yards
from
here
you
will
break
up
into
pairs
a
pilot
and
for
each
jet
sria
krishna
and
pandit
had
already
paired
themselves
together
you
work
on
your
own
time
getting
the
cargo
with
loading
it
taking
off
delivering
it
to
the
denebian
freighter
at
the
spaceport
when
you
are
finished
you
collect
your
pay
where
do
we
sleep
someone
asked
orkap
smiled
you
did
come
out
here
to
sleep
there
is
only
a
limited
amount
of
cargo
the
jets
are
swift
you
will
be
paid
according
to
the
amount
of
work
you
do
any
other
questions
what
about
food
a
plump
young
ophiuchan
asked
you
will
be
given
energy
tablets
as
many
as
you
wish
any
other
questions
no
good
i
have
two
additional
things
to
say
first
you
are
not
to
examine
your
cargo
under
any
circumstances
either
here
or
in
transit
or
on
the
spacefield
there
are
televid
units
in
each
jet
so
you
will
be
watched
at
all
times
second
orkap
paused
and
let
the
silence
grow
and
spread
across
the
dazzling
white
expanse
there
is
a
spy
among
you
wearing
the
body
of
an
ophiuchan
but
in
reality
well
i
do
have
to
tell
you
who
he
is
in
reality
orkap
smiled
grimly
there
is
only
one
in
the
galaxy
but
one
is
quite
enough
one
of
the
pilots
said
a
little
breathlessly
johnny
mayhem
orkap
smiled
again
i
am
aware
of
mayhem
identity
he
said
but
not
going
to
do
anything
about
it
the
pilots
waited
the
sun
glared
down
balefully
you
see
orkap
told
them
we
can
not
be
altogether
sure
that
the
rest
of
you
are
here
simply
to
earn
your
twenty
credits
a
flight
mayhem
has
unwittingly
become
our
insurance
find
mayhem
find
the
spy
among
you
a
hundred
credits
bonus
to
the
man
who
does
pandit
looked
at
sria
who
whistled
the
girl
said
if
they
think
we
can
finish
the
job
without
sleep
picking
up
cargo
and
flying
it
to
the
spaceport
and
returning
for
more
then
a
hundred
credits
is
probably
more
than
any
of
us
will
earn
they
all
be
looking
like
hawks
for
this
mayhem
and
pandit
agreed
if
there
a
native
spy
among
them
he
be
afraid
to
show
himself
for
fear
they
think
he
mayhem
very
clever
of
the
denebians
to
work
at
once
orkap
was
saying
he
wore
a
blaster
on
his
hip
the
only
weapon
among
them
they
all
trudged
behind
him
through
the
burning
faceless
sands
soon
they
reached
a
depression
from
which
the
sand
had
been
cleared
baring
the
white
bedrock
of
the
empty
places
in
the
rock
a
square
opening
had
been
cut
shielded
on
each
side
from
the
shifting
sands
by
an
lip
a
ramp
led
down
into
darkness
you
will
find
your
cargo
down
there
also
enough
to
go
around
orkap
explained
the
cargo
is
crated
the
crates
must
remain
intact
is
that
understood
it
was
understood
their
sudden
mutual
suspicion
a
pall
worse
than
the
heat
the
ophiuchans
descended
the
ramp
they
needed
the
money
or
they
would
be
here
the
money
meant
more
to
them
than
anything
this
was
no
time
to
be
yet
one
of
them
was
a
spy
for
the
galactic
league
johnny
mayhem
one
of
them
but
which
pandit
made
a
quick
estimate
of
the
number
of
crates
they
were
stacked
neatly
against
one
wall
each
about
four
feet
by
four
by
four
and
from
the
size
of
them
a
single
crate
would
fill
the
cargo
bay
of
each
of
the
jets
pandit
made
a
rough
estimate
two
dozen
crates
perhaps
in
the
dim
light
it
was
hard
to
tell
two
dozen
crates
six
jets
twelve
ophiuchans
four
trips
for
each
jet
a
half
hour
to
load
ten
minutes
to
unload
an
hour
and
a
half
by
jet
to
the
spacefield
three
hours
and
forty
minutes
round
trip
say
four
hours
four
times
four
sixteen
sixteen
hours
of
steady
work
for
eighty
credits
no
time
for
mystery
or
suspicion
barely
time
for
mistrust
you
there
a
voice
called
what
are
you
doing
it
was
one
of
the
other
ophiuchans
quite
the
biggest
of
the
lot
pandit
had
seen
him
outside
and
remembered
his
name
he
was
raj
shiva
a
tall
muscular
swarthy
ophiuchan
with
small
alert
suspicious
eyes
and
a
livid
scar
alongside
his
jaw
nothing
pandit
said
nothing
no
the
others
are
loading
already
i
be
watching
you
for
a
hundred
credits
pandit
thought
furiously
but
said
nothing
sria
touched
his
shoulder
i
have
one
of
the
she
said
let
get
about
it
right
said
pandit
raj
shiva
watched
them
a
few
moments
longer
then
drifted
away
with
his
own
partner
it
took
pandit
and
sria
sweating
copiously
in
the
tremendous
heat
a
few
minutes
less
than
half
an
hour
to
load
one
of
the
crates
aboard
their
jet
three
of
the
other
ships
were
already
airborne
whining
away
toward
the
spacefield
pandit
looked
at
the
crate
there
were
no
markings
on
it
anywhere
the
wood
looked
new
but
that
meant
absolutely
nothing
in
the
dry
heat
of
the
empty
places
wood
would
last
a
century
a
millennium
they
could
not
tell
how
old
it
was
ready
sria
krishna
called
from
the
controls
pandit
had
secured
the
crate
in
the
cargo
bay
ready
he
responded
moments
later
acceleration
thrust
them
back
in
the
twin
pilot
seats
sria
leveled
the
jet
at
twenty
thousand
and
they
sped
at
eight
hundred
miles
an
hour
toward
the
city
and
the
spacefield
just
beyond
it
do
you
wonder
about
it
sria
asked
after
a
while
about
what
the
cargo
we
are
supposed
to
i
know
sria
laughed
i
a
woman
you
see
pandit
grinned
at
her
curiosity
he
said
a
woman
trait
on
any
world
sria
got
up
from
the
pilot
chair
but
pandit
placed
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
gently
shoved
her
down
again
they
have
a
televid
unit
aboard
he
said
remember
sria
nodded
the
jet
sped
on
they
landed
at
the
spacefield
they
were
the
fourth
jet
down
and
one
of
the
other
three
had
taken
off
on
the
return
leg
of
the
flight
a
denebian
pandit
had
never
seen
before
was
supervising
the
garbed
laborers
loading
the
crates
aboard
a
denebian
spaceship
with
sria
he
delivered
their
crate
on
the
returned
with
the
sled
to
their
jet
and
took
off
just
short
of
four
hours
from
the
time
they
started
they
returned
to
the
empty
places
they
had
gained
a
little
time
and
were
the
second
team
down
from
the
jet
ahead
of
them
raj
shiva
led
a
puny
orkap
stood
in
the
underground
storage
room
looking
at
his
wrist
chrono
he
said
to
the
four
ophiuchans
who
came
down
the
ramp
you
made
fine
time
raj
shiva
puny
companion
said
something
but
raj
shiva
grabbed
his
arm
and
they
began
to
load
a
second
crate
pandit
and
sria
loaded
theirs
in
silence
they
made
their
second
round
trip
in
four
hours
exactly
it
was
completely
dark
when
they
returned
to
the
empty
places
sria
was
worried
they
would
overshoot
the
cargo
point
but
pandit
brought
the
little
jet
down
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
its
takeoff
point
they
could
see
nothing
when
they
shut
off
the
jet
running
lights
except
for
the
glow
which
came
from
the
underground
room
they
reached
it
and
went
down
the
ramp
pandit
judged
that
half
the
crates
were
gone
now
he
took
a
quick
tour
of
the
room
while
sria
got
the
into
position
against
one
of
the
crates
nobody
here
pandit
said
in
a
whisper
the
denebian
must
be
sleeping
in
the
yes
sria
said
a
little
breathlessly
i
was
thinking
what
sria
said
do
stop
if
we
wanted
to
examine
one
of
the
boxes
it
would
be
suicide
to
open
the
one
we
take
but
we
could
open
one
of
them
down
here
see
what
it
is
take
another
for
ourselves
you
would
do
this
sria
asked
him
why
pandit
shrugged
i
have
eyes
he
said
our
gurus
did
not
broadcast
the
to
outworlders
until
the
denebians
came
then
they
started
have
the
denebians
sold
them
on
the
idea
i
do
know
sria
said
well
let
assume
they
have
why
why
would
they
do
such
a
thing
sria
let
me
get
this
straight
pandit
first
you
think
the
gurus
actually
are
making
the
outworlders
kill
themselves
of
course
pandit
said
it
mental
suggestion
on
a
scale
only
our
gurus
are
capable
of
but
do
you
see
sria
they
would
do
it
on
their
own
the
gurus
are
dirty
careless
about
their
bodies
but
terribly
arrogant
left
alone
they
would
think
the
outworlders
important
enough
to
be
concerned
over
one
way
or
another
they
certainly
would
kill
them
go
on
sria
urged
all
right
the
gurus
have
great
knowledge
of
the
mystical
but
externally
they
naive
let
suppose
someone
came
along
the
denebians
in
this
case
and
found
something
they
wanted
very
badly
on
ophiuchus
these
crates
here
sria
what
would
they
do
they
go
to
the
gurus
and
convince
them
it
would
be
difficult
that
any
intercourse
with
outworlders
would
be
harmful
to
ophiuchus
that
the
outworlders
want
to
colonize
and
exploit
our
world
that
sort
of
thing
while
the
gurus
are
stewing
it
over
the
denebians
could
have
prepared
this
shipment
here
whatever
it
is
for
departure
but
the
gurus
too
well
convinced
by
them
could
have
acted
sooner
than
they
expected
making
it
all
but
impossible
for
the
small
handful
of
outworlders
the
denebians
among
them
to
go
abroad
without
fear
of
taking
their
own
lives
perhaps
a
few
like
orkap
and
that
other
denebian
are
not
at
all
perhaps
a
few
can
withstand
it
as
for
the
rest
it
indoors
and
away
from
the
mental
influence
of
the
gurus
or
off
ophiuchus
entirely
which
would
leave
the
denebians
with
a
problem
they
had
thought
of
his
words
made
sense
yes
cried
sria
excitedly
now
that
they
have
their
valuable
cargo
ready
to
go
how
can
they
get
it
off
ophiuchus
without
help
we
said
pandit
softly
are
that
help
sria
asked
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
i
do
know
i
honestly
do
i
never
had
anything
against
the
outworlders
how
could
i
we
all
progeny
of
outworlders
who
came
here
almost
five
hundred
years
ago
from
a
place
called
india
on
earth
but
the
gurus
have
been
deceived
you
said
so
yourself
pandit
was
sweating
and
it
was
more
than
the
heat
which
made
him
sweat
he
paced
up
to
the
crates
then
back
again
then
to
the
crates
suddenly
he
said
all
right
all
right
i
do
it
someone
got
to
find
out
what
the
denebians
want
here
and
pandit
began
to
pry
at
one
of
the
boxes
with
a
knife
he
carried
in
his
loin
cloth
sria
said
i
keep
watch
you
call
me
when
opened
maybe
you
ought
to
get
out
of
here
in
case
anything
happens
i
want
to
get
you
involved
but
sria
went
up
the
ramp
and
crouched
there
waiting
watching
the
desert
was
very
quiet
entirely
windless
and
hot
even
at
night
stars
sprinkled
the
sky
overhead
and
far
off
she
thought
she
heard
the
distant
whine
of
a
jet
hurry
she
called
from
below
she
heard
the
sound
of
wood
being
pried
away
from
wood
she
heard
or
imagined
she
heard
the
jet
coming
closer
hurry
she
called
softly
finally
three
words
drifted
up
to
her
come
here
sria
she
felt
a
little
relieved
now
that
he
finished
she
listened
for
the
jet
now
she
heard
nothing
she
went
swiftly
down
the
ramp
pandit
stood
before
one
of
the
crates
perspiring
freely
he
had
pried
loose
one
of
the
side
walls
and
a
smooth
metal
surface
with
stenciled
lettering
on
it
was
exposed
he
said
i
ca
read
that
it
a
language
i
never
saw
before
sria
bent
closer
and
looked
at
the
stenciled
lettering
a
voice
not
pandit
said
i
thought
it
would
be
you
two
no
do
move
a
big
muscular
figure
silhouetted
against
the
starlight
and
a
smaller
puny
figure
raj
shiva
and
his
a
hundred
credits
each
handus
raj
shiva
said
as
he
ran
down
the
ramp
can
you
keep
the
girl
from
getting
away
handus
rushed
down
at
his
heels
pandit
met
raj
shiva
at
the
foot
of
the
ramp
pandit
was
a
big
man
by
ophiuchan
standards
but
raj
shiva
was
bigger
run
sria
pandit
cried
and
met
the
giant
with
his
knife
raj
shiva
parried
the
blow
with
his
forearm
then
his
big
hands
moved
swiftly
and
the
knife
clattered
to
the
floor
sria
ran
for
the
ramp
her
bare
feet
padding
swiftly
against
the
stone
floor
handus
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
foot
of
the
ramp
in
an
awkward
crouch
she
had
a
glimpse
of
raj
shiva
and
pandit
straining
together
then
handus
struck
her
with
his
balled
fist
it
was
a
puny
blow
but
sria
staggered
back
her
jaw
numb
laughing
shrilly
handus
leaped
at
her
she
was
shoved
back
tripped
over
something
and
fell
for
a
moment
all
the
lights
blinked
out
inside
her
head
inside
no
raj
shiva
and
pandit
stumbled
about
the
room
struck
something
there
was
a
loud
popping
sound
a
tinkling
and
the
lights
in
the
storage
room
went
out
where
is
she
handus
called
i
ca
find
her
she
heard
him
groping
about
heard
the
others
struggling
together
she
got
to
her
feet
and
stood
perfectly
still
waiting
for
anything
she
wished
she
had
a
weapon
something
she
was
only
a
woman
then
a
voice
whispered
hurry
sria
hurry
pandit
he
took
her
arm
in
the
darkness
she
could
see
him
they
went
to
the
crates
and
wrestled
one
on
their
not
the
open
one
sria
gasped
no
no
they
heard
footsteps
saw
a
figure
for
a
moment
silhouetted
against
starlight
handus
was
fleeing
probably
for
help
they
took
their
sled
out
into
the
night
and
dragged
it
across
the
sand
toward
their
waiting
jet
they
loaded
the
crate
in
the
cargo
bay
while
pandit
was
finishing
the
job
in
the
darkness
sria
sat
down
at
the
controls
ready
she
shouted
above
the
whine
of
the
jets
pandit
said
that
he
was
she
hardly
heard
his
voice
a
moment
later
she
took
the
small
cargo
jet
up
she
heard
pandit
moving
in
the
small
cabin
behind
her
she
said
we
ought
to
take
it
to
the
league
authorities
do
you
think
she
had
to
shout
to
be
heard
above
the
whining
roar
of
the
jets
why
i
was
able
to
read
the
writing
it
procyonian
pandit
do
you
know
anything
about
the
procyonians
well
a
few
centuries
ago
they
were
the
most
warlike
people
in
the
galaxy
it
was
rumored
they
had
a
cache
of
thermonuclear
bombs
hidden
somewhere
after
such
weapons
were
outlawed
in
the
century
the
cache
was
never
found
until
tonight
we
found
it
pandit
but
orkap
and
that
true
it
was
found
by
the
denebians
first
do
you
see
pandit
orkap
and
the
others
private
denebian
traders
it
was
the
government
it
never
is
the
government
these
days
but
unscrupulous
individuals
pandit
armed
with
two
dozen
hydrogen
bombs
why
they
could
take
over
their
own
world
on
threat
of
imminent
destruction
or
some
outworld
plum
they
had
their
eye
on
or
i
see
pandit
voice
was
barely
audible
above
the
whine
of
the
jets
it
a
job
the
galactic
league
can
handle
sria
went
on
now
that
it
out
in
the
open
or
will
be
as
soon
as
we
get
to
the
spacefield
you
done
your
work
pandit
and
your
people
wo
forget
you
for
it
as
for
me
my
work
here
is
finished
too
your
work
above
the
roar
of
the
jet
sria
shouted
yes
i
am
johnny
mayhem
she
smiled
in
the
darkness
johnny
mayhem
she
thought
in
a
girl
body
well
he
been
young
men
and
old
weak
and
strong
sick
and
healthy
human
and
alien
outworlder
so
why
not
a
girl
too
all
at
once
pandit
hand
lay
heavily
on
her
shoulder
she
turned
around
and
in
the
darkness
but
with
the
lights
of
the
instrument
board
on
it
saw
the
gleam
of
a
knife
blade
the
face
beyond
the
blade
leering
from
darkness
was
not
pandit
she
had
actually
known
it
was
pandit
she
had
seen
him
she
hardly
been
able
to
hear
his
voice
it
was
raj
shiva
fly
us
to
denebian
exports
he
said
or
i
kill
you
and
do
it
myself
you
making
a
mistake
your
people
belong
with
the
galactic
league
not
with
a
handful
of
adventurers
who
the
denebians
are
right
raj
shiva
said
fanatically
my
people
would
be
better
off
left
alone
i
flying
this
jet
to
the
spaceport
and
the
league
i
kill
you
i
know
all
about
you
mayhem
you
not
a
woman
really
you
not
even
a
native
that
a
dead
body
is
it
but
if
i
kill
it
again
while
you
in
it
you
die
to
you
do
what
i
say
this
very
night
unless
something
was
done
about
it
the
cache
of
thermonuclear
weapons
would
be
the
first
hydrogen
bombs
loose
in
the
galaxy
for
almost
five
hundred
years
would
mankind
ever
begin
to
learn
thought
wearily
he
knew
the
answer
of
course
most
men
would
but
the
few
who
refused
could
bring
destruction
to
an
entire
galaxy
moments
before
apparent
success
of
a
mission
now
failure
or
death
or
both
sria
hand
flashed
out
suddenly
and
struck
the
instrument
board
the
jet
plummeted
earthward
with
a
loud
whining
sound
sria
felt
herself
shoved
back
by
the
tremendous
acceleration
into
the
cushions
of
the
pilot
chair
she
heard
a
wild
exclamation
from
raj
shiva
but
turn
around
to
see
what
had
happened
she
kept
the
ship
hurtling
earthward
she
knew
it
was
dangerous
and
might
even
prove
disastrous
her
body
could
take
so
much
then
she
would
black
out
but
if
she
did
maintain
the
dive
until
the
last
possible
instant
raj
shiva
would
get
control
of
the
ship
and
its
vital
cargo
she
was
only
a
girl
but
she
was
protected
by
the
of
the
pilot
chair
raj
shiva
unprotected
was
behind
her
somewhere
down
through
the
thin
upper
atmosphere
of
ophiuchus
ix
screamed
the
small
ship
its
blinking
on
and
off
in
warning
as
friction
scorched
its
thin
shell
the
scream
of
air
became
more
as
the
atmosphere
became
thicker
ten
thousand
feet
eight
thousand
six
sria
eyes
saw
black
her
breath
was
labored
needles
of
pain
darted
in
her
skull
plucked
at
her
eyes
she
opened
her
mouth
to
scream
but
heard
nothing
she
felt
as
if
she
must
be
forced
clear
through
the
protective
cushions
of
the
pilot
chair
five
thousand
feet
four
thousand
blackness
and
peace
and
a
settling
lassitude
three
thousand
feet
with
hands
that
would
barely
function
sria
with
supreme
effort
brought
the
jet
out
of
its
she
slumped
in
the
pilot
chair
for
a
long
time
too
weak
to
do
anything
else
then
she
looked
back
at
raj
shiva
who
lay
slack
and
unconscious
against
the
rear
bulkhead
of
the
cargo
ship
brought
the
jet
down
and
middle
of
the
night
or
no
saw
kovandaswamy
raj
shiva
was
taken
into
custody
a
jet
was
sent
out
loaded
with
leaguemen
who
had
proved
immune
to
the
guru
and
all
armed
to
the
teeth
it
landed
at
the
cache
and
stood
guard
over
it
pandit
was
found
unconscious
one
of
his
arms
broken
but
otherwise
all
right
a
second
jet
prevented
the
denebian
export
ship
from
blasting
off
with
the
hydrogen
bombs
already
loaded
orkap
and
his
companion
were
taken
into
custody
the
rest
of
course
is
history
the
gurus
of
ophiuchus
ix
were
shown
what
had
been
taking
place
in
the
name
of
friendship
between
themselves
and
deneb
and
in
the
name
of
isolation
most
of
the
gurus
retired
entirely
from
active
life
the
few
who
did
not
spent
the
rest
of
their
days
working
for
cooperation
between
ophiuchus
and
the
rest
of
the
galactic
league
orkap
and
his
companion
were
sent
back
to
deneb
for
punishment
two
weeks
later
kovandaswamy
shook
sria
hand
a
girl
he
said
you
did
it
as
a
girl
i
still
ca
believe
it
but
then
of
such
stuff
is
the
mayhem
legend
made
mayhem
smiled
already
the
hub
had
a
new
assignment
for
him
he
could
feel
the
old
excitement
the
wonder
stirring
him
he
smiled
again
and
told
kovandaswamy
better
not
tell
that
fellow
pandit
i
think
he
had
a
crush
on
sria
