december
the
my
dear
maurice
it
was
in
normandy
you
will
remember
and
in
the
heat
of
the
year
when
the
birds
were
silent
in
the
trees
and
the
apples
nearly
ripe
with
the
sun
above
us
already
of
a
stronger
kind
and
a
somnolence
within
and
without
that
it
was
determined
among
us
the
jolly
company
that
i
should
write
upon
nothing
and
upon
all
that
is
cognate
to
nothing
a
task
not
yet
attempted
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
now
when
the
matter
was
begun
and
the
subject
nearly
approached
i
saw
more
clearly
that
this
writing
upon
nothing
might
be
very
grave
and
as
i
looked
at
it
in
every
way
the
difficulties
of
my
adventure
appalled
me
nor
am
i
certain
that
i
have
overcome
them
all
but
i
had
promised
you
that
i
would
proceed
and
so
i
did
in
spite
of
my
doubts
and
terrors
for
first
i
perceived
that
in
writing
upon
this
matter
i
was
in
peril
of
offending
the
privilege
of
others
and
of
those
especially
who
are
powerful
since
i
would
be
discussing
things
very
dear
and
domestic
to
my
such
as
the
honour
of
politicians
the
tact
of
great
ladies
the
wealth
of
journalists
the
enthusiasm
of
gentlemen
and
the
wit
of
bankers
all
that
is
most
intimate
and
dearest
to
the
men
that
make
our
time
all
that
they
would
most
defend
from
the
vulgar
gaze
this
it
was
proposed
to
make
the
theme
of
a
common
book
in
spite
of
such
natural
fear
and
of
interests
so
powerful
to
detain
me
i
have
completed
my
task
and
i
will
confess
that
as
it
grew
it
enthralled
me
there
is
in
nothing
something
so
majestic
and
so
high
that
it
is
a
fascination
and
spell
to
regard
it
is
it
not
that
which
mankind
after
the
great
effort
of
life
at
last
attains
and
that
which
alone
can
satisfy
mankind
desire
is
it
not
that
which
is
the
end
of
so
many
generations
of
analysis
the
final
word
of
philosophy
and
the
goal
of
the
search
for
reality
is
it
not
the
very
matter
of
our
modern
creed
in
which
the
great
spirits
of
our
time
repose
and
is
it
not
as
it
were
the
culmination
of
their
intelligence
it
is
indeed
the
sum
and
meaning
of
all
around
how
well
has
the
world
perceived
it
and
how
powerfully
do
its
legends
illustrate
what
nothing
is
to
men
you
know
that
once
in
lombardy
alfred
and
charlemagne
and
the
kaliph
met
to
make
trial
of
their
swords
the
sword
of
alfred
was
a
simple
sword
its
name
was
hewer
and
the
sword
of
charlemagne
was
a
french
sword
and
its
name
was
joyeuse
but
the
sword
of
haroun
was
of
the
finest
steel
forged
in
toledo
tempered
at
cordova
blessed
in
mecca
damascened
as
one
might
imagine
in
damascus
sharpened
upon
jacob
stone
and
so
wrought
that
when
one
struck
it
it
sounded
like
a
bell
and
as
for
its
name
by
allah
that
was
very
subtle
it
had
no
name
at
all
well
then
upon
that
day
in
lombardy
alfred
and
charlemagne
and
the
kaliph
were
met
to
take
a
trial
of
their
blades
alfred
took
a
pig
of
lead
which
he
had
brought
from
the
mendip
hills
and
swiping
the
air
once
or
twice
in
the
western
fashion
he
cut
through
that
lead
and
girded
the
edge
of
his
sword
upon
the
rock
beneath
making
a
little
dent
then
charlemagne
taking
in
both
hands
his
sword
joyeuse
and
aiming
at
the
dent
with
a
laugh
swung
down
and
cut
the
stone
itself
right
through
so
that
it
fell
into
two
pieces
one
on
either
side
and
there
they
lie
today
near
by
piacenza
in
a
field
now
that
it
had
come
to
the
kaliph
turn
one
would
have
said
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
for
hewer
had
manfully
hewn
lead
and
joyeuse
had
joyfully
cleft
stone
but
the
kaliph
with
an
arabian
look
picked
out
of
his
pocket
a
gossamer
scarf
from
cashmir
so
light
that
when
it
was
tossed
into
the
air
it
would
hardly
fall
to
the
ground
but
floated
downwards
slowly
like
a
mist
this
with
a
light
pass
he
severed
and
immediately
received
the
prize
for
it
was
deemed
more
difficult
by
far
to
divide
such
a
veil
in
than
to
cleave
lead
or
even
stone
i
knew
a
man
once
maurice
who
was
at
oxford
for
three
years
and
after
that
went
down
with
no
degree
at
college
while
his
friends
were
seeking
for
truth
in
funny
brown
german
philosophies
sham
religions
stinking
bottles
and
identical
equations
he
was
lying
on
his
back
in
eynsham
meadows
thinking
of
nothing
and
got
the
truth
by
this
parallel
road
of
his
much
more
quickly
than
did
they
by
theirs
for
the
asses
are
still
seeking
mildly
disputing
and
in
a
cultivated
manner
following
the
gleam
so
that
they
have
become
in
their
donnish
middleage
a
nuisance
and
a
pest
while
he
that
other
with
the
truth
very
fast
and
firm
at
the
end
of
a
leather
thong
is
dragging
her
sliding
whining
and
crouching
on
her
four
feet
dragging
her
reluctant
through
the
world
even
into
the
broad
daylight
where
truth
most
hates
to
be
he
it
was
who
became
my
master
in
this
creed
for
once
as
we
lay
under
a
hedge
at
the
corner
of
a
road
near
bagley
wood
we
heard
far
off
the
notes
of
military
music
and
the
distant
marching
of
a
column
these
notes
and
that
tramp
grew
louder
till
there
swung
round
the
turning
with
a
blaze
of
sound
five
hundred
men
in
order
they
passed
and
we
were
full
of
the
scene
and
of
the
memories
of
the
world
when
he
said
to
me
do
you
know
what
is
in
your
heart
it
is
the
music
and
do
you
know
the
cause
and
mover
of
that
music
it
is
the
nothingness
inside
the
bugle
it
is
the
hollow
nothingness
inside
the
drum
then
i
thought
of
the
poem
where
it
says
of
the
army
of
the
republic
the
thunder
of
the
limber
and
the
rumble
of
a
hundred
of
the
guns
and
there
hums
as
she
comes
the
roll
of
her
innumerable
drums
i
knew
him
to
be
right
from
this
first
moment
i
determined
to
consider
and
to
meditate
upon
nothing
many
things
have
i
discovered
about
nothing
which
have
proved
it
to
me
at
least
to
be
the
warp
or
ground
of
all
that
is
holiest
it
is
of
such
fine
gossamer
that
loveliness
was
spun
the
mists
under
the
hills
on
an
autumn
morning
are
but
gross
reflections
of
it
moonshine
on
lovers
is
earthy
compared
with
it
song
sung
most
charmingly
and
stirring
the
dearest
recollections
is
but
a
failure
in
the
human
attempt
to
reach
its
embrace
and
be
dissolved
in
it
it
is
out
of
nothing
that
are
woven
those
fine
poems
of
which
we
carry
but
vague
rhythms
in
the
head
and
that
woman
who
is
a
shade
insaisissable
several
have
enshrined
in
melody
well
her
christian
name
her
maiden
name
and
as
i
personally
believe
her
married
name
as
well
is
nothing
i
never
see
a
gallery
of
pictures
now
but
i
know
how
the
use
of
empty
spaces
makes
a
scheme
nor
do
i
ever
go
to
a
play
but
i
see
how
silence
is
half
the
merit
of
acting
and
hope
some
day
for
absence
and
darkness
as
well
upon
the
stage
what
do
you
think
the
fairy
melisende
said
to
when
he
had
lost
his
soul
for
her
and
he
met
her
in
the
marshes
after
twenty
years
why
nothing
what
else
could
she
have
said
nothing
is
the
reward
of
good
men
who
alone
can
pretend
to
taste
it
in
long
easy
sleep
it
is
the
meditation
of
the
wise
and
the
charm
of
happy
dreamers
so
excellent
and
final
is
it
that
i
would
here
and
now
declare
to
you
that
nothing
was
the
gate
of
eternity
that
by
passing
through
nothing
we
reached
our
every
object
as
passionate
and
happy
beings
were
it
not
for
the
council
of
toledo
that
restrains
my
pen
yet
indeed
indeed
when
i
think
what
an
elixir
is
this
nothing
i
am
for
putting
up
a
statue
nowhere
on
a
pedestal
that
shall
not
exist
and
for
inscribing
on
it
in
letters
that
shall
never
be
written
to
nothing
the
human
race
in
gratitude
so
i
began
to
write
my
book
maurice
and
as
i
wrote
it
the
dignity
of
what
i
had
to
do
rose
continually
before
me
as
does
the
dignity
of
a
mountain
range
which
first
seemed
a
vague
part
of
the
sky
but
at
last
stands
out
august
and
fixed
before
the
traveller
or
as
the
sky
at
night
may
seem
to
a
man
released
from
a
dungeon
who
sees
it
but
gradually
first
bewildered
by
the
former
constraint
of
his
narrow
room
but
now
gradually
enlarging
to
drink
in
its
immensity
indeed
this
nothing
is
too
great
for
any
man
who
has
once
embraced
it
to
leave
it
alone
thenceforward
for
ever
and
finally
the
dignity
of
nothing
is
sufficiently
exalted
in
this
that
nothing
is
the
tenuous
stuff
from
which
the
world
was
made
for
when
the
elohim
set
out
to
make
the
world
first
they
debated
among
themselves
the
idea
and
one
suggested
this
and
another
suggested
that
till
they
had
threshed
out
between
them
a
very
pretty
picture
of
it
all
there
were
to
be
hills
beyond
hills
good
grass
and
trees
and
the
broadness
of
rivers
animals
of
all
kinds
both
comic
and
terrible
and
savours
and
colours
and
all
around
the
ceaseless
streaming
of
the
sea
now
when
they
had
got
that
far
and
debated
the
idea
in
detail
and
with
amendment
and
resolve
it
very
greatly
concerned
them
of
what
so
admirable
a
compost
should
be
mixed
some
said
of
this
and
some
said
of
that
but
in
the
long
run
it
was
decided
by
the
narrow
majority
of
eight
in
a
full
house
that
nothing
was
the
only
proper
material
out
of
which
to
make
this
world
of
theirs
and
out
of
nothing
they
made
it
as
it
says
in
the
ballade
dear
tenuous
stuff
of
which
the
world
was
made
and
again
in
the
envoi
prince
draw
this
sovereign
draught
in
your
despair
that
when
your
riot
in
that
rest
is
laid
you
shall
be
merged
with
an
essential
air
dear
tenuous
stuff
of
which
the
world
was
made
out
of
nothing
then
did
they
proceed
to
make
the
world
this
sweet
world
always
excepting
man
the
marplot
man
was
made
in
a
muddier
fashion
as
you
shall
hear
for
when
the
world
seemed
ready
finished
and
as
it
were
presentable
for
use
and
was
full
of
ducks
tigers
mastodons
waddling
hippopotamuses
lilting
deer
herbs
angry
lions
frowsy
snakes
cracked
glaciers
regular
waterfalls
coloured
sunsets
and
the
rest
it
suddenly
came
into
the
head
of
the
youngest
of
these
strong
makers
of
the
world
the
youngest
who
had
been
sat
upon
and
snubbed
all
the
while
the
thing
was
doing
and
hardly
been
allowed
to
look
on
let
alone
to
touch
it
suddenly
came
into
his
little
head
i
say
that
he
would
make
a
man
then
the
elder
elohim
said
some
of
them
oh
leave
well
alone
send
him
to
bed
and
others
said
sleepily
for
they
were
tired
no
no
let
him
play
his
little
trick
and
have
done
with
it
and
then
we
shall
have
some
rest
little
did
they
know
and
others
again
who
were
still
broad
awake
looked
on
with
amusement
and
applauded
saying
go
on
little
one
let
us
see
what
you
can
do
but
when
these
last
stooped
to
help
the
child
they
found
that
all
the
nothing
had
been
used
up
and
that
is
why
there
is
none
of
it
about
so
the
little
fellow
began
to
cry
but
they
to
comfort
him
said
tut
lad
tut
do
not
cry
do
your
best
with
this
bit
of
mud
it
will
always
serve
to
fashion
something
so
the
jolly
little
fellow
took
the
dirty
lump
of
mud
and
pushed
it
this
way
and
that
jabbing
with
his
thumb
and
scraping
with
his
nail
until
at
last
he
had
made
picanthropos
who
lived
in
java
and
was
a
fool
who
begat
eoanthropos
who
begat
meioanthropos
who
begat
pleioanthropos
who
begat
pleistoanthropos
who
is
often
mixed
up
with
his
father
and
a
great
warning
against
keeping
the
same
names
in
one
family
who
begat
paleoanthropos
who
begat
neoanthropos
who
begat
the
three
anthropoids
great
mumblers
and
murmurers
with
their
mouths
and
the
eldest
of
these
begat
him
whose
son
was
he
from
whom
we
are
all
descended
he
was
indeed
halting
and
patchy
passionate
and
rude
bald
of
one
cheek
and
blind
of
one
eye
and
his
legs
were
of
different
sizes
nevertheless
by
process
of
ascent
have
we
his
descendants
manfully
continued
to
develop
and
to
progress
and
to
swell
in
everything
until
from
homer
we
came
to
euripides
and
from
euripides
to
seneca
and
from
seneca
to
boethius
and
his
peers
and
from
these
to
duns
scotus
and
so
upwards
through
james
i
of
england
and
the
fifth
sixth
or
seventh
of
scotland
for
it
is
impossible
to
remember
these
things
and
on
on
to
my
lord
macaulay
and
in
the
very
last
reached
you
the
great
summits
of
the
human
race
and
last
perfection
of
the
ages
readers
of
this
book
and
you
also
maurice
to
whom
it
is
dedicated
and
myself
who
have
written
it
for
gain
on
nothing
on
the
pleasure
of
taking
up
one
pen
among
the
sadder
and
smaller
pleasures
of
this
world
i
count
this
pleasure
the
pleasure
of
taking
up
one
pen
it
has
been
said
by
very
many
people
that
there
is
a
tangible
pleasure
in
the
mere
act
of
writing
in
choosing
and
arranging
words
it
has
been
denied
by
many
it
is
affirmed
and
denied
in
the
life
of
doctor
johnson
and
for
my
part
i
would
say
that
it
is
very
true
in
some
rare
moods
and
wholly
false
in
most
others
however
of
writing
and
the
pleasure
in
it
i
am
not
writing
here
with
pleasure
but
of
the
pleasure
of
taking
up
one
pen
which
is
quite
another
matter
note
what
the
action
means
you
are
alone
even
if
the
room
is
crowded
as
was
the
in
the
hotel
at
paddington
only
the
other
day
when
i
wrote
my
statistical
abstract
of
christendom
even
if
the
room
is
crowded
you
must
have
made
yourself
alone
to
be
able
to
write
at
all
you
must
have
built
up
some
kind
of
wall
and
isolated
your
mind
you
are
alone
then
and
that
is
the
beginning
if
you
consider
at
what
pains
men
are
to
be
alone
how
they
climb
mountains
enter
prisons
profess
monastic
vows
put
on
eccentric
daily
habits
and
seclude
themselves
in
the
garrets
of
a
great
town
you
will
see
that
this
moment
of
taking
up
the
pen
is
not
least
happy
in
the
fact
that
then
by
a
mere
association
of
ideas
the
writer
is
alone
so
much
for
that
now
not
only
are
you
alone
but
you
are
going
to
create
when
people
say
create
they
flatter
themselves
no
man
can
create
anything
i
knew
a
man
once
who
drew
a
horse
on
a
bit
of
paper
to
amuse
the
company
and
covered
it
all
over
with
many
parallel
streaks
as
he
drew
when
he
had
done
this
an
aged
priest
present
upon
that
occasion
said
you
are
pleased
to
draw
a
zebra
when
the
priest
said
this
the
man
began
to
curse
and
to
swear
and
to
protest
that
he
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
a
zebra
he
said
it
was
all
done
out
of
his
own
head
and
he
called
heaven
to
witness
and
his
patron
saint
for
he
was
of
the
old
english
territorial
catholic
families
his
patron
saint
was
aethelstan
and
the
salvation
of
his
immortal
soul
he
also
staked
that
he
was
as
innocent
of
zebras
as
the
babe
unborn
but
there
he
persuaded
no
one
and
the
priest
scored
it
was
most
evident
that
the
territorial
was
crammed
full
of
zebraical
knowledge
all
this
then
is
a
digression
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
man
creating
but
anyhow
when
you
take
up
your
pen
you
do
something
devilish
pleasing
there
is
a
prospect
before
you
you
are
going
to
develop
a
germ
i
do
know
what
it
is
and
i
promise
you
i
wo
call
it
creation
but
possibly
a
god
is
creating
through
you
and
at
least
you
are
making
believe
at
creation
anyhow
it
is
a
sense
of
mastery
and
of
origin
and
you
know
that
when
you
have
done
something
will
be
added
to
the
world
and
little
destroyed
for
what
will
you
have
destroyed
or
wasted
a
certain
amount
of
white
paper
at
a
farthing
a
square
yard
and
i
am
not
certain
it
is
not
pleasanter
all
diversified
and
variegated
with
black
wriggles
a
certain
amount
of
ink
meant
to
be
spread
and
dried
made
for
no
other
purpose
a
certain
infinitesimal
amount
of
quill
torn
from
the
silly
goose
for
no
purpose
whatsoever
but
to
minister
to
the
high
needs
of
man
here
you
cry
affectation
affectation
how
do
i
know
that
the
fellow
writes
with
a
quill
a
most
unlikely
habit
to
that
i
answer
you
are
right
less
assertion
please
and
more
humility
i
will
tell
you
frankly
with
what
i
am
writing
i
am
writing
with
a
waterman
ideal
fountain
pen
the
nib
is
of
pure
gold
as
was
the
throne
of
charlemagne
in
the
song
of
roland
that
throne
i
need
hardly
tell
you
was
borne
into
spain
across
the
cold
and
awful
passes
of
the
pyrenees
by
no
less
than
a
hundred
and
twenty
mules
and
all
the
western
world
adored
it
and
trembled
before
it
when
it
was
set
up
at
every
halt
under
pine
trees
on
the
upland
grasses
for
he
sat
upon
it
dreadful
and
commanding
there
weighed
upon
him
two
centuries
of
age
his
brows
were
level
with
justice
and
experience
and
his
beard
was
so
tangled
and
full
that
he
was
called
charlemagne
you
have
read
how
when
he
stretched
out
his
hand
at
evening
the
sun
stood
still
till
he
had
found
the
body
of
roland
no
you
must
read
about
these
things
well
then
the
pen
is
of
pure
gold
a
pen
that
runs
straight
away
like
a
willing
horse
or
a
jolly
little
ship
indeed
it
is
a
pen
so
excellent
that
it
reminds
me
of
my
subject
the
pleasure
of
taking
up
one
pen
god
bless
you
pen
when
i
was
a
boy
and
they
told
me
work
was
honourable
useful
cleanly
sanitary
wholesome
and
necessary
to
the
mind
of
man
i
paid
no
more
attention
to
them
than
if
they
had
told
me
that
public
men
were
usually
honest
or
that
pigs
could
fly
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
were
merely
saying
silly
things
they
had
been
told
to
say
nor
do
i
doubt
to
this
day
that
those
who
told
me
these
things
at
school
were
but
preaching
a
dull
and
careless
round
but
now
i
know
that
the
things
they
told
me
were
true
god
bless
you
pen
of
work
pen
of
drudgery
pen
of
letters
pen
of
posings
pen
rabid
pen
ridiculous
pen
glorified
pray
little
pen
be
worthy
of
the
love
i
bear
you
and
consider
how
noble
i
shall
make
you
some
day
when
you
shall
live
in
a
glass
case
with
a
crowd
of
tourists
round
you
every
day
from
to
pen
of
justice
pen
of
the
pen
of
majesty
and
of
light
i
will
write
with
you
some
day
a
considerable
poem
it
is
a
compact
between
you
and
me
if
i
can
not
make
one
of
my
own
then
i
will
write
out
some
other
man
but
you
pen
come
what
may
shall
write
out
a
good
poem
before
you
die
if
it
is
only
the
the
pleasure
of
taking
up
one
pen
has
also
this
peculiar
among
all
pleasures
that
you
have
the
freedom
to
lay
it
down
when
you
will
not
so
with
love
not
so
with
victory
not
so
with
glory
had
i
begun
the
other
way
round
i
would
have
called
this
work
the
pleasure
of
laying
down
one
pen
but
i
began
it
where
i
began
it
and
i
am
going
on
to
end
it
just
where
it
is
going
to
end
what
other
occupation
avocation
dissertation
or
intellectual
recreation
can
you
cease
at
will
not
bridge
you
go
on
playing
to
win
not
public
speaking
they
ring
a
bell
not
mere
converse
you
have
to
answer
everything
the
other
insufficient
person
says
not
life
for
it
is
wrong
to
kill
one
self
and
as
for
the
natural
end
of
living
that
does
not
come
by
one
choice
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
most
capricious
of
all
accidents
but
the
pen
you
lay
down
when
you
will
at
any
moment
without
remorse
without
anxiety
without
dishonour
you
are
free
to
do
this
dignified
and
final
thing
i
am
just
going
to
do
it
you
lay
it
down
on
getting
respected
in
inns
and
hotels
to
begin
at
the
beginning
is
next
to
ending
at
the
end
the
whole
art
of
writing
as
for
the
middle
you
may
fill
it
in
with
any
rubble
that
you
choose
but
the
beginning
and
the
end
like
the
strong
stone
outer
walls
of
mediaeval
buildings
contain
and
define
the
whole
and
there
is
more
than
this
since
writing
is
a
human
and
a
living
art
the
beginning
being
the
motive
and
the
end
the
object
of
the
work
each
inspires
it
each
runs
through
organically
and
the
two
between
them
give
life
to
what
you
do
so
i
will
begin
at
the
beginning
and
i
will
lay
down
this
first
principle
that
religion
and
the
full
meaning
of
things
has
nowhere
more
disappeared
from
the
modern
world
than
in
the
department
of
guide
books
for
a
guide
book
will
tell
you
always
what
are
the
principal
and
most
vulgar
sights
of
a
town
what
mountains
are
most
difficult
to
climb
and
invariably
the
exact
distances
between
one
place
and
another
but
these
things
do
not
serve
the
end
of
man
the
end
of
man
is
happiness
and
how
much
happier
are
you
with
such
a
knowledge
now
there
are
some
guide
books
which
do
make
little
excursions
now
and
then
into
the
important
things
which
tell
you
for
instance
what
kind
of
cooking
you
will
find
in
what
places
what
kind
of
wine
in
countries
where
this
beverage
is
publicly
known
and
even
a
few
more
daring
than
the
rest
will
give
a
hint
or
two
upon
hiring
mules
and
upon
the
way
that
a
bargain
should
be
conducted
or
how
to
fight
but
with
all
this
even
the
best
of
them
do
not
go
to
the
moral
heart
of
the
matter
they
do
not
give
you
a
hint
or
an
idea
of
that
which
is
surely
the
basis
of
all
happiness
in
travel
i
mean
the
art
of
gaining
respect
in
the
places
where
you
stay
unless
that
respect
is
paid
you
you
are
more
miserable
by
far
than
if
you
had
stayed
at
home
and
i
would
ask
anyone
who
reads
this
whether
he
can
remember
one
single
journey
of
his
which
was
not
marred
by
the
evident
contempt
which
the
servants
and
the
owners
of
taverns
showed
for
him
wherever
he
went
it
is
therefore
of
the
first
importance
much
more
important
than
any
question
of
price
or
distance
to
know
something
of
this
art
it
is
not
difficult
to
learn
moreover
it
is
so
little
exploited
that
if
you
will
but
learn
it
you
will
have
a
sense
of
privilege
and
of
upstanding
among
your
fellows
worth
all
the
holidays
which
were
ever
taken
in
the
world
of
this
respect
which
we
seek
out
of
so
many
human
pleasures
a
facile
and
a
very
false
interpretation
is
that
it
is
the
privilege
of
the
rich
and
i
even
knew
one
poor
fellow
who
forged
a
cheque
and
went
to
gaol
in
his
desire
to
impress
the
host
of
the
spotted
dog
near
barnard
castle
it
was
an
error
in
him
as
it
is
in
all
who
so
imagine
the
rich
in
their
degree
fall
under
this
contempt
as
heavily
as
any
and
there
is
no
wealth
that
can
purchase
the
true
awe
which
it
should
be
your
aim
to
receive
from
waiters
and
publicans
i
knew
a
man
once
who
set
out
walking
from
oxford
to
from
to
cheltenham
from
cheltenham
to
ledbury
from
ledbury
to
hereford
from
hereford
to
new
rhayader
where
the
cobbler
lives
and
from
new
rhayader
to
the
end
of
the
world
which
lies
a
little
west
and
north
of
that
place
and
all
the
way
he
slept
rough
under
hedges
and
in
stacks
or
by
day
in
open
fields
so
terrified
was
he
at
the
thought
of
the
contempt
that
awaited
him
should
he
pay
for
a
bed
and
i
knew
another
man
who
walked
from
york
to
thirsk
and
from
thirsk
to
darlington
and
from
darlington
to
durham
and
so
on
up
to
the
border
and
over
it
and
all
the
way
he
pretended
to
be
extremely
poor
so
that
he
might
be
certain
the
contempt
he
received
was
due
to
nothing
of
his
own
but
to
his
clothes
only
but
this
was
an
indifferent
way
of
escaping
for
it
got
him
into
many
fights
with
miners
and
he
was
arrested
by
the
police
in
lanchester
and
at
jedburgh
where
his
money
did
really
fail
him
he
had
to
walk
all
through
the
night
finding
that
no
one
would
take
in
such
a
tatterdemalion
the
thing
could
be
done
much
more
cheaply
than
that
and
much
more
respectably
and
you
can
acquire
with
but
little
practice
one
of
many
ways
of
achieving
the
full
respect
of
the
whole
house
even
of
that
proud
woman
who
sits
behind
glass
in
front
of
an
enormous
ledger
and
the
first
way
is
this
as
you
come
into
the
place
go
straight
for
the
and
begin
talking
of
the
local
sport
and
do
not
talk
humbly
and
tentatively
as
so
many
do
but
in
a
loud
authoritative
tone
you
shall
insist
and
lay
down
the
law
and
fly
into
a
passion
if
you
are
contradicted
there
is
here
an
objection
which
will
arise
in
the
mind
of
every
niggler
and
boggler
who
has
in
the
past
very
properly
been
covered
with
ridicule
and
become
the
butt
of
the
waiters
and
which
is
that
if
one
is
ignorant
of
the
local
sport
there
is
an
end
to
the
business
the
objection
is
ridiculous
do
you
suppose
that
the
people
whom
you
hear
talking
around
you
are
more
learned
than
yourself
in
the
matter
and
if
they
are
do
you
suppose
that
they
are
acquainted
with
your
ignorance
remember
that
most
of
them
have
read
far
less
than
you
and
that
you
can
draw
upon
an
experience
of
travel
of
which
they
can
know
nothing
do
but
make
the
plunge
practising
first
in
the
villages
of
the
midlands
i
will
warrant
you
that
in
a
very
little
while
bold
assertion
of
this
kind
will
carry
you
through
any
or
in
britain
i
remember
once
in
the
holy
and
secluded
village
of
washington
under
the
downs
there
came
in
upon
us
as
we
sat
in
the
inn
there
a
man
whom
i
recognised
though
he
did
not
know
me
for
a
journalist
incapable
of
understanding
the
driving
of
a
cow
let
alone
horses
a
prophet
a
socialist
a
man
who
knew
the
trend
of
things
and
so
forth
a
man
who
had
never
been
outside
a
town
except
upon
a
motor
bicycle
upon
which
snorting
beast
indeed
had
he
come
to
this
inn
but
if
he
was
less
than
us
in
so
many
things
he
was
greater
than
us
in
this
art
of
gaining
respect
in
inns
and
hotels
for
he
sat
down
and
when
they
had
barely
had
time
to
say
good
day
to
him
he
gave
us
in
minutest
detail
a
great
run
after
a
fox
a
run
that
never
took
place
we
were
fifteen
men
in
the
room
none
of
us
were
anything
like
rich
enough
to
hunt
and
the
lie
went
through
them
like
an
express
this
fellow
found
whatever
that
may
mean
at
gumber
corner
ran
right
through
the
combe
which
by
the
way
is
one
of
those
bits
of
land
which
have
been
stolen
bodily
from
the
english
people
cut
down
the
sutton
road
across
the
railway
at
coates
and
there
he
showed
the
cloven
hoof
for
your
liar
always
takes
his
hounds
across
the
railway
then
all
over
egdean
and
killed
in
a
field
near
wisborough
all
this
he
told
and
there
was
not
even
a
man
there
to
ask
him
whether
all
those
little
dogs
and
horses
swam
the
rother
or
jumped
it
he
was
treated
like
a
god
they
tried
to
make
him
stop
but
he
would
not
he
was
off
to
worthing
where
i
have
no
doubt
he
told
some
further
lies
upon
the
growing
of
tomatoes
under
glass
which
is
the
main
sport
of
that
district
similarly
i
have
no
doubt
such
a
man
would
talk
about
boats
at
king
lynn
murder
with
violence
at
croydon
duck
shooting
at
ely
and
racing
anywhere
then
also
if
you
are
in
any
doubt
as
to
what
they
want
of
you
you
can
always
change
the
scene
thus
fishing
is
dangerous
for
even
the
poor
can
fish
and
the
chances
are
you
do
not
know
the
names
of
the
animals
and
you
may
be
putting
fish
into
the
stream
of
lambourne
or
talking
of
salmon
upon
the
upper
thames
but
what
is
to
prevent
you
putting
on
a
look
of
distance
and
marvel
and
conjuring
up
the
north
atlantic
for
them
hold
them
with
the
cold
and
the
fog
of
the
newfoundland
seas
and
terrify
their
simple
minds
with
whales
a
second
way
to
attain
respect
if
you
are
by
nature
a
silent
man
and
one
which
i
think
is
always
successful
is
to
write
before
you
go
to
bed
and
leave
upon
the
table
a
great
number
of
envelopes
which
you
should
address
to
members
of
the
cabinet
and
jewish
dukes
and
in
general
any
of
the
great
it
is
but
slight
labour
and
for
the
contents
you
can
not
do
better
than
put
into
each
envelope
one
of
those
advertisements
which
you
will
find
lying
about
then
next
morning
you
should
gather
them
up
and
ask
where
the
post
is
but
you
need
not
post
them
and
you
need
not
fear
for
your
bill
your
bill
will
stand
much
the
same
and
your
reputation
will
swell
like
a
sponge
and
a
third
way
is
to
go
to
the
telephone
since
there
are
telephones
nowadays
and
ring
up
whoever
in
the
neighbourhood
is
of
the
greatest
importance
there
is
no
law
against
it
and
when
you
have
the
number
you
have
but
to
ask
the
servant
at
the
other
end
whether
it
is
not
somebody
else
house
but
in
the
meanwhile
your
night
in
the
place
is
secure
and
a
fourth
way
is
to
tell
them
to
call
you
extremely
early
and
then
to
get
up
extremely
late
now
why
this
should
have
the
effect
it
has
i
confess
i
can
not
tell
i
lay
down
the
rule
empirically
and
from
long
observation
but
i
may
suggest
that
perhaps
it
is
the
combination
of
the
energy
you
show
in
early
rising
and
of
the
luxury
you
show
in
late
rising
for
energy
and
luxury
are
the
two
qualities
which
menials
most
admire
in
that
governing
class
to
which
you
flatter
yourself
you
belong
moreover
the
strength
of
will
with
which
you
sweep
aside
their
inconvenience
ordering
one
thing
and
doing
another
is
not
without
its
effect
and
the
stir
you
have
created
is
of
use
to
you
and
the
fifth
way
is
to
be
strong
to
dominate
and
to
lead
to
be
one
of
the
makers
of
this
world
one
of
the
builders
to
have
the
more
powerful
will
to
arouse
in
all
around
you
by
mere
force
of
personality
a
feeling
that
they
must
obey
but
i
do
not
know
how
this
is
done
on
ignorance
there
is
not
anything
that
can
so
suddenly
flood
the
mind
with
shame
as
the
conviction
of
ignorance
yet
we
are
all
ignorant
of
nearly
everything
there
is
to
be
known
is
it
not
wonderful
then
that
we
should
be
so
sensitive
upon
the
discovery
of
a
fault
which
must
of
necessity
be
common
to
all
and
that
in
its
highest
degree
the
conviction
of
ignorance
would
not
shame
us
thus
if
it
were
not
for
the
public
appreciation
of
our
failure
if
a
man
proves
us
ignorant
of
german
or
the
complicated
order
of
english
titles
or
the
rules
of
bridge
or
any
other
matter
we
do
not
care
for
his
proofs
so
that
we
are
alone
with
him
first
because
we
can
easily
deny
them
all
and
continue
to
wallow
in
our
ignorance
without
fear
and
secondly
because
we
can
always
counter
with
something
we
know
and
that
he
knows
nothing
of
such
as
the
creed
or
the
history
of
little
bukleton
or
some
favourite
book
then
again
if
one
is
alone
with
one
opponent
it
is
quite
easy
to
pretend
that
the
subject
on
which
one
has
shown
ignorance
is
unimportant
peculiar
pedantic
hole
in
the
corner
and
this
can
be
brazened
out
even
about
greek
or
latin
or
again
one
can
turn
the
laugh
against
him
saying
that
he
has
just
been
cramming
up
the
matter
and
that
he
is
airing
his
knowledge
or
one
can
begin
making
jokes
about
him
till
he
grows
angry
and
so
forth
there
is
no
necessity
to
be
ashamed
but
if
there
be
others
present
ah
est
aliud
that
is
another
matter
for
then
the
biting
shame
of
ignorance
suddenly
displayed
conquers
and
bewilders
us
we
have
no
defence
left
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
discoverer
we
own
and
confess
and
become
insignificant
we
slink
away
note
that
all
this
depends
upon
what
the
audience
conceive
ignorance
to
be
it
is
very
certain
that
if
a
man
should
betray
in
some
cheap
club
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
ride
a
horse
he
would
be
broken
down
and
lost
and
similarly
if
you
are
in
a
country
house
among
the
rich
you
are
shipwrecked
unless
you
can
show
acquaintance
with
the
press
and
among
the
poor
you
must
be
very
careful
not
only
to
wear
good
cloth
and
to
talk
gently
as
though
you
owned
them
but
also
to
know
all
about
the
rich
among
very
young
men
to
seem
ignorant
of
vice
is
the
ruin
of
you
and
you
had
better
not
have
been
born
than
appear
doubtful
of
the
effects
of
strong
drink
when
you
are
in
the
company
of
patriots
there
was
a
man
who
died
of
shame
this
very
year
in
a
village
of
savoy
because
he
did
not
know
the
name
of
the
king
reigning
over
france
and
it
is
a
common
thing
to
see
men
utterly
cast
down
in
the
off
the
strand
because
they
can
not
correctly
recite
the
opening
words
of
boys
of
the
empire
there
are
schoolgirls
who
fall
ill
and
pine
away
because
they
are
shown
to
have
misplaced
the
name
of
dagobert
iii
in
the
list
of
merovingian
monarchs
and
quite
fearless
men
will
blush
if
they
are
found
ignoring
the
family
name
of
some
peer
indeed
there
is
nothing
so
contemptible
or
insignificant
but
that
in
some
society
or
other
it
is
required
to
be
known
and
that
the
ignorance
of
it
may
not
at
any
moment
cover
one
with
confusion
nevertheless
we
should
not
on
that
account
attempt
to
learn
everything
there
is
to
know
for
that
is
manifestly
impossible
nor
even
to
learn
everything
that
is
known
for
that
would
soon
prove
a
tedious
and
task
we
should
rather
study
the
means
to
be
employed
for
warding
off
those
sudden
and
public
convictions
of
ignorance
which
are
the
ruin
of
so
many
these
methods
of
defence
are
very
numerous
and
are
for
the
most
part
easy
of
acquirement
the
most
powerful
of
them
by
far
but
the
most
dangerous
is
to
fly
into
a
passion
and
marvel
how
anyone
can
be
such
a
fool
as
to
pay
attention
to
wretched
trifles
powerful
because
it
appeals
to
that
strongest
of
all
passions
in
men
by
which
they
are
predisposed
to
cringe
before
what
they
think
to
be
a
superior
station
in
society
dangerous
because
if
it
fail
in
its
objects
this
method
does
not
save
you
from
pain
and
secures
you
in
addition
a
bad
quarrel
and
perhaps
a
heavy
beating
still
it
has
many
votaries
and
is
more
often
carried
off
than
any
other
thus
if
in
bedfordshire
someone
catches
you
erring
on
a
matter
of
crops
you
profess
that
in
london
such
things
are
thought
mere
rubbish
and
despised
or
again
in
the
society
of
professors
at
the
universities
an
ignorance
of
letters
can
easily
be
turned
by
an
allusion
to
that
vapid
life
of
the
rich
where
letters
grow
insignificant
so
at
sea
if
you
slip
on
common
terms
speak
a
little
of
your
luxurious
occupations
on
land
and
you
will
usually
be
safe
there
are
other
and
better
defences
one
of
these
is
to
turn
the
attack
by
showing
great
knowledge
on
a
cognate
point
or
by
remembering
that
the
knowledge
your
opponent
boasts
has
been
somewhere
contradicted
by
an
authority
thus
if
some
day
a
friend
should
say
as
continually
happens
in
a
london
club
come
let
us
hear
you
decline
greek
tetummenos
on
you
can
answer
carelessly
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
the
form
is
purely
paradigmatic
it
is
never
found
or
again
if
you
put
the
wrekin
by
an
error
into
staffordshire
you
can
say
i
was
thinking
of
the
jurassic
formation
which
is
the
basis
of
the
formation
of
etc
or
well
shrewsbury
staffordshire
oh
i
had
got
my
mind
mixed
up
with
the
graves
of
the
staffords
very
few
people
will
dispute
this
none
will
follow
it
there
is
indeed
this
difficulty
attached
to
such
a
method
that
it
needs
the
knowledge
of
a
good
many
things
and
a
ready
imagination
and
a
stiff
face
but
it
is
a
good
way
yet
another
way
is
to
cover
your
retreat
with
buffoonery
pretending
to
be
ignorant
of
the
most
ordinary
things
so
as
to
seem
to
have
been
playing
the
fool
only
when
you
made
your
first
error
there
is
a
special
form
of
this
method
which
has
always
seemed
to
me
the
most
excellent
by
far
of
all
known
ways
of
escape
it
is
to
show
a
steady
and
crass
ignorance
of
very
nearly
everything
that
can
be
mentioned
and
with
all
this
to
keep
a
steady
mouth
a
determined
eye
and
this
is
essential
to
show
by
a
hundred
allusions
that
you
have
on
your
own
ground
an
excellent
store
of
knowledge
this
is
the
true
in
this
kind
of
assault
and
therefore
the
perfection
of
tactics
thus
if
one
should
say
well
it
was
the
old
story
greek
anankae
it
might
happen
to
anyone
to
answer
i
never
read
the
play
this
you
will
think
perhaps
an
irremediable
fall
but
it
is
not
as
will
appear
from
this
dialogue
in
which
the
method
is
developed
sapiens
but
good
heavens
it
is
a
play
ignoramus
of
course
not
i
know
that
as
well
as
you
but
the
character
of
greek
anankae
dominates
the
play
you
wo
deny
that
sapiens
you
do
seem
to
have
much
acquaintance
with
liddell
and
scott
ignoramus
i
did
know
there
was
anyone
called
liddell
in
it
but
i
knew
scott
intimately
both
before
and
after
he
succeeded
to
the
estate
sapiens
but
i
mean
the
dictionary
ignoramus
i
quite
certain
that
his
father
would
let
him
write
a
dictionary
why
the
library
at
bynton
has
been
opened
for
years
if
after
five
minutes
of
that
ignoramus
can
not
get
sapiens
floundering
about
in
a
world
he
knows
nothing
of
it
is
his
own
fault
but
if
sapiens
is
there
is
a
final
method
which
may
not
be
the
most
perfect
but
which
i
have
often
tried
myself
and
usually
with
very
considerable
success
sapiens
nonsense
man
the
dictionary
the
dictionary
ignoramus
what
has
to
do
with
greek
sapiens
i
said
greek
anankae
ignoramus
oh
h
h
you
said
greek
anankae
did
you
i
thought
you
said
ananti
of
course
scott
did
call
the
play
ananti
but
ananti
was
the
principal
character
and
one
always
calls
it
that
in
the
family
it
is
very
well
written
if
he
had
that
shyness
about
publishing
and
so
forth
lastly
or
rather
penultimately
there
is
the
method
of
upsetting
the
plates
and
dishes
breaking
your
chair
setting
fire
to
the
house
shooting
yourself
or
otherwise
swallowing
all
the
memory
of
your
shame
in
a
great
catastrophe
but
that
is
a
method
for
cowards
the
brave
man
goes
out
into
the
hall
comes
back
with
a
stick
and
says
firmly
you
have
just
deliberately
and
cruelly
exposed
my
ignorance
before
this
company
i
shall
therefore
beat
you
soundly
with
this
stick
in
the
presence
of
them
all
this
you
then
do
to
him
or
he
to
you
mutandis
ceteris
and
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
on
ignorance
on
advertisement
harmonides
of
ephesus
says
in
one
of
his
treatises
upon
method
i
forget
which
but
i
think
the
fifth
that
a
matter
is
very
often
more
clearly
presented
by
way
of
example
than
in
the
form
of
a
direct
statement
and
analysis
i
have
determined
to
follow
the
advice
of
this
great
though
pagan
authority
in
what
you
will
now
read
or
not
read
according
to
your
inclination
as
i
was
sitting
one
of
these
sunny
mornings
in
my
little
park
reading
an
article
upon
vivisection
in
the
newspaper
a
domestic
be
seated
be
seated
i
pray
you
brought
me
a
letter
upon
a
silver
salver
be
covered
which
reminds
me
why
do
people
say
that
silver
is
the
only
perfect
spondee
in
the
english
language
salver
is
a
perfectly
good
spondee
so
is
so
is
so
is
so
is
wenchthorpe
so
is
forewarp
which
is
the
rope
you
throw
out
from
the
stem
to
the
little
man
in
the
boat
who
comes
to
moor
you
along
the
west
gully
in
the
ramsgate
harbour
so
is
longnose
the
name
of
a
buoy
and
of
a
reef
of
rocks
just
north
of
the
north
foreland
so
are
a
great
many
other
words
but
i
digress
i
only
put
in
these
words
to
show
you
in
case
you
had
any
dissolving
doubts
remaining
upon
the
matter
that
the
kind
of
stuff
you
read
is
very
often
all
nonsense
and
that
you
must
not
take
things
for
granted
merely
because
they
are
printed
i
have
watched
you
doing
it
from
time
to
time
and
have
been
torn
between
pity
and
anger
but
all
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
this
habit
of
parenthesis
is
the
ruin
of
good
prose
as
i
was
saying
example
clearly
put
down
without
comment
is
very
often
more
powerful
than
analysis
for
the
purpose
of
conviction
the
domestic
brought
me
a
letter
upon
a
silver
salver
i
took
it
and
carefully
examined
the
outside
they
err
who
will
maintain
through
thick
and
thin
upon
a
mere
theory
and
without
any
true
experience
of
the
world
that
it
matters
not
what
the
outside
of
a
letter
may
be
so
long
as
the
contents
provoke
terror
or
amusement
the
outside
of
a
letter
should
appeal
to
one
when
one
gets
a
letter
with
a
halfpenny
stamp
and
with
the
flap
of
the
letter
stuck
inside
and
with
the
address
on
the
outside
typewritten
one
is
very
apt
to
throw
it
away
i
believe
that
there
is
no
recorded
case
of
such
a
letter
containing
a
cheque
a
summons
or
an
invitation
to
eat
good
food
and
as
for
demand
notes
what
are
they
then
again
those
long
envelopes
which
come
with
the
notice
paid
in
bulk
outside
instead
of
a
stamp
no
man
can
be
moved
by
them
they
are
very
nearly
always
advertisements
of
cheap
wine
do
not
misunderstand
me
cheap
wine
is
by
no
means
to
be
despised
there
are
some
sorts
of
wine
the
less
you
pay
for
them
the
better
they
are
within
reason
and
if
a
gentleman
has
bought
up
a
bankrupt
stock
of
wine
from
a
fellow
to
whom
he
has
been
lending
money
why
on
earth
should
he
not
sell
it
again
at
a
reasonable
profit
yet
quite
cheap
it
seems
to
be
pure
benefit
to
the
world
but
i
perceive
that
all
this
is
leading
me
from
my
subject
i
took
up
the
letter
i
say
and
carefully
examined
the
outside
it
was
written
in
the
hand
of
an
educated
man
it
was
almost
illegible
and
had
all
the
appearance
of
what
an
honest
citizen
of
some
culture
might
write
to
one
hurriedly
about
some
personal
matter
i
noticed
that
it
had
come
from
the
eastern
central
district
but
when
you
consider
what
an
enormous
number
of
people
live
there
during
the
day
that
did
not
prejudice
me
against
it
now
when
i
opened
this
letter
i
found
it
written
a
little
more
carefully
but
still
written
not
printed
or
typewritten
or
manifolded
or
lithographed
or
anything
else
of
that
kind
it
was
written
the
art
of
writing
but
patience
patience
it
was
written
it
was
very
cordial
and
it
appealed
directly
only
the
style
was
otiose
but
in
matters
of
the
first
importance
style
is
a
hindrance
no
the
mercury
nishan
dear
sir
many
people
wonder
especially
in
your
profession
what
is
it
a
certain
taedium
vitae
seizes
them
towards
five
in
the
afternoon
the
stress
and
hurry
of
modern
life
have
forced
so
many
of
us
to
draw
upon
our
nervous
energy
that
we
imagine
look
at
that
the
whole
elizabethan
tradition
chucked
away
are
exceeding
our
powers
and
when
this
depression
comes
over
us
we
think
it
necessary
to
take
a
rest
and
let
up
from
working
this
is
an
erroneous
supposition
what
it
means
is
that
our
body
has
received
insufficient
nutriment
during
the
last
hours
and
that
nature
is
craving
for
more
sustenance
we
shall
be
very
happy
to
offer
you
through
the
medium
of
this
paper
a
special
offer
of
our
essence
of
the
ox
this
offer
will
only
remain
open
until
derby
day
during
which
period
a
box
of
our
essence
of
the
ox
will
be
sent
to
you
free
if
you
will
enclose
the
following
form
and
send
it
to
us
in
the
stamped
envelope
which
accompanies
this
letter
very
faithfully
yours
henry
de
la
mere
ullmo
it
seemed
to
me
a
most
extraordinary
thing
i
had
never
written
for
ullmo
and
his
and
i
could
do
them
no
good
in
the
world
either
here
or
in
johannesburg
i
was
never
likely
to
write
for
him
at
all
he
is
not
very
pleasant
he
is
by
no
means
rich
he
is
he
has
no
character
at
all
apart
from
rather
unsuccessful
and
from
a
habit
of
defending
with
some
virulence
but
with
no
capacity
his
fellow
throughout
the
world
however
i
thought
no
more
about
it
and
went
on
reading
about
vivisection
two
days
later
i
got
a
letter
upon
thick
paper
so
grained
as
to
imitate
oak
and
having
at
the
top
a
of
the
most
complicated
kind
this
had
a
little
lamb
on
it
suspended
by
a
girdle
as
though
it
were
being
slung
on
board
ship
there
were
also
three
little
sheaves
of
wheat
a
sword
three
panthers
some
gules
and
a
mullet
above
it
was
a
helmet
and
there
were
two
supporters
one
was
a
man
with
a
club
and
the
other
was
another
man
without
a
club
both
naked
underneath
was
the
motto
tout
Ã 
toi
this
second
letter
was
very
short
sir
can
you
tell
me
why
you
have
not
answered
our
letter
re
the
essence
of
the
ox
derby
day
is
approaching
and
the
remaining
time
is
very
short
we
made
the
offer
specially
to
you
and
we
had
at
least
expected
the
courtesy
of
an
acknowledgment
you
will
understand
that
the
business
of
a
great
newspaper
leaves
but
little
time
for
private
charity
but
we
are
willing
to
let
the
offer
remain
open
for
three
days
longer
after
which
date
how
easy
it
would
be
to
criticise
this
english
to
continue
after
which
date
the
price
will
inevitably
be
raised
to
one
we
remain
i
had
this
letter
framed
with
the
other
and
i
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
keeping
back
from
the
bank
for
fear
of
frightening
the
fish
and
hardly
breathing
what
happened
was
after
four
or
five
days
a
very
sad
letter
which
said
that
ullmo
expected
better
things
from
me
but
that
he
knew
what
the
stress
of
modern
life
was
and
how
often
correspondence
fell
into
arrears
he
sent
me
a
smaller
specimen
box
of
the
essence
of
the
ox
i
have
it
still
and
there
it
is
there
is
no
moral
there
is
no
conclusion
or
application
the
world
is
not
quite
infinite
but
it
is
astonishingly
full
all
sorts
of
things
happen
in
it
there
are
all
sorts
of
different
men
and
different
ways
of
action
and
different
goals
to
which
life
may
be
directed
why
in
a
little
wood
near
home
not
a
hundred
yards
long
there
will
soon
burst
in
the
spring
i
wish
i
were
there
hundreds
of
thousands
of
leaves
and
no
one
leaf
exactly
like
another
at
least
so
the
parish
priest
used
to
say
and
though
i
have
never
had
the
leisure
to
put
the
thing
to
the
proof
i
am
willing
to
believe
that
he
was
right
for
he
spoke
with
authority
on
a
house
i
appeal
loudly
to
the
muse
of
history
whose
name
i
forget
and
you
never
knew
to
help
me
in
the
description
of
this
house
for
the
muse
of
tragedy
would
overstrain
herself
on
it
the
muse
of
comedy
would
be
impertinent
upon
it
the
muse
of
music
never
heard
of
it
the
muse
of
fine
arts
disapproved
of
it
the
muse
of
public
instruction
tut
tut
there
i
was
nearly
making
a
tenth
muse
i
was
thinking
of
the
french
ministry
the
muse
of
epic
poetry
did
not
understand
it
the
muse
of
lyric
poetry
still
less
so
the
muse
of
astronomy
is
thinking
of
other
things
the
muse
polyhymnia
or
polymnia
who
according
to
of
is
commonly
represented
in
a
pensive
attitude
has
no
attribute
and
does
no
work
and
as
for
little
terpsichore
whose
feet
are
like
the
small
waves
in
summer
time
she
would
laugh
in
a
peal
if
i
asked
her
to
write
think
of
describe
or
dance
in
this
house
and
that
makes
eleven
muses
no
matter
better
more
than
less
yet
it
was
a
house
worthy
of
description
and
careful
inventory
and
for
that
reason
i
have
appealed
to
the
muse
of
history
whose
business
it
is
to
set
down
everything
in
order
as
it
happens
judging
between
good
and
evil
selecting
facts
condensing
narratives
admitting
picturesque
touches
and
showing
her
further
knowledge
by
the
allusive
method
or
use
of
the
dependent
clause
well
then
inspired
i
will
tell
you
exactly
how
that
house
was
disposed
first
there
ran
up
the
middle
of
it
a
staircase
which
had
horace
seen
it
and
heaven
knows
he
was
the
kind
of
man
to
live
in
such
a
house
he
would
have
called
in
his
original
and
striking
way
res
angusta
domi
for
it
was
a
narrow
thing
narrow
do
i
call
it
yes
and
yet
not
so
narrow
it
was
narrow
enough
to
avoid
all
appearance
of
comfort
or
majesty
yet
not
so
narrow
as
to
be
quaint
or
snug
it
was
so
designed
that
two
people
could
walk
exactly
abreast
for
it
was
necessary
that
upon
great
occasions
the
ladies
should
be
taken
down
from
the
by
the
gentlemen
to
the
yet
it
would
have
been
a
sin
and
a
shame
to
make
it
wider
than
that
and
the
house
was
not
built
in
the
days
of
crinolines
upon
these
occasions
it
was
customary
for
the
couples
to
go
down
in
order
and
in
stately
fashion
and
the
hostess
went
last
but
do
not
imagine
that
there
was
any
order
of
precedence
oh
no
far
from
it
they
went
as
they
were
directed
this
staircase
filled
up
a
kind
of
chimney
or
funnel
or
rather
parallelepiped
in
the
house
between
each
floor
was
a
landing
where
it
turned
right
round
on
itself
and
on
each
floor
a
larger
landing
flanked
by
two
doors
on
either
side
which
made
four
altogether
this
staircase
was
covered
with
brussels
carpet
and
let
me
tell
you
in
passing
that
no
better
covering
for
stairs
was
ever
yet
invented
it
wears
well
and
can
be
turned
and
when
the
uppers
are
worn
you
can
move
the
whole
thing
down
one
file
and
put
the
steps
where
the
uppers
were
none
of
your
cocoanut
stuff
or
gimcracks
for
the
honest
house
when
there
is
money
you
should
have
brussels
when
you
have
none
linoleum
but
i
digress
the
were
of
brass
and
beautifully
polished
the
banisters
of
iron
painted
to
look
like
mahogany
and
this
staircase
which
i
may
take
to
be
the
emblem
of
a
good
life
lived
for
duty
went
up
one
pair
and
two
pair
and
three
pair
all
in
the
same
way
and
did
not
stop
till
it
got
to
the
top
but
just
as
a
good
life
has
beneath
it
a
human
basis
so
this
heaven
forgive
me
somewhat
commonplace
staircase
changed
its
character
when
it
passed
the
hall
door
and
as
it
ran
down
to
the
basement
had
no
landing
ornament
carpet
or
other
paraphernalia
but
a
sound
flight
of
stone
steps
with
a
cold
rim
of
unpainted
metal
for
the
hand
the
hall
that
led
to
these
steps
was
oblong
and
little
furnished
there
was
a
a
fireplace
in
which
a
fire
was
not
lit
and
two
pictures
one
a
photograph
of
the
poor
men
to
whom
the
owner
paid
weekly
wages
at
his
works
all
set
out
in
a
phalanx
or
rather
fan
with
the
owner
of
the
house
and
them
in
the
middle
the
other
a
steel
engraving
entitled
the
monarch
of
the
forest
from
a
painting
by
sir
edwin
landseer
it
represented
a
stag
and
was
very
ugly
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
house
which
is
a
libel
for
it
was
some
feet
above
the
ground
and
was
led
up
to
by
several
steps
as
the
porch
could
show
there
were
four
rooms
the
the
the
and
the
the
was
so
called
because
all
meals
were
held
in
it
the
because
it
was
customary
to
smoke
all
over
the
house
except
the
the
because
it
was
at
the
back
and
the
because
it
was
downstairs
upon
my
soul
i
would
give
you
a
better
reason
if
i
had
one
but
i
have
none
only
i
may
say
that
the
was
remarkable
for
two
stuffed
birds
the
from
the
fact
that
the
owner
lived
in
it
and
felt
at
ease
there
the
from
the
fact
that
no
one
ever
went
into
it
and
quite
right
too
while
the
but
the
stands
separate
the
was
well
carpeted
it
had
in
its
midst
a
large
mahogany
table
so
made
that
it
could
get
still
larger
by
the
addition
of
leaves
inside
there
were
even
flaps
as
well
it
had
eleven
chairs
and
these
in
stood
ranged
round
the
wall
thinking
of
nothing
but
at
meal
times
were
according
to
the
number
wanted
put
round
the
table
it
is
a
theory
among
those
who
believe
that
a
spirit
nourishes
all
things
from
within
that
there
was
some
competition
amongst
these
chairs
as
to
which
should
be
used
at
table
so
dull
forlorn
and
purposeless
was
their
life
against
the
wall
seven
pictures
hung
on
that
wall
not
because
it
was
a
mystic
number
but
because
it
filled
up
all
the
required
space
two
on
each
side
of
the
and
three
large
ones
on
the
opposite
wall
they
were
all
of
them
engravings
and
one
of
them
at
least
was
that
of
a
prominent
statesman
lord
beaconsfield
while
the
rest
had
to
do
with
historical
subjects
such
as
the
visit
of
prince
albert
to
the
exhibition
of
and
i
really
forget
what
else
there
was
a
chiffonier
at
the
end
of
the
room
in
which
the
wines
and
spirits
were
kept
and
which
also
had
a
above
it
also
a
white
cloth
on
the
top
for
no
reason
on
earth
an
in
which
the
owner
sat
commonly
stood
at
the
head
of
the
table
this
remained
there
even
between
meals
and
was
a
symbol
that
he
was
master
of
the
house
four
meals
were
held
here
breakfast
at
eight
dinner
at
one
tea
at
six
and
a
kind
of
supper
when
the
children
had
gone
to
bed
at
nine
or
so
but
what
am
i
saying
musa
historiae
tendis
dear
dear
i
thought
i
was
back
again
in
the
old
times
a
thousand
pardons
at
the
time
my
story
opens
and
closes
also
for
that
matter
for
i
deal
of
the
owner
and
the
house
articulo
so
to
speak
on
the
very
edge
of
death
it
was
far
otherwise
breakfast
was
when
you
like
for
him
however
always
at
the
same
old
hour
and
there
he
would
sit
alone
his
wife
dead
his
son
asleep
trying
to
read
his
newspaper
but
staring
out
from
time
to
time
through
the
window
and
feeling
very
dinner
was
no
longer
dinner
there
was
luncheon
to
which
nobody
came
except
on
saturdays
then
there
was
another
thing
called
by
the
old
name
of
dinner
at
seven
and
what
had
happened
to
supper
no
one
ever
made
out
some
people
said
it
had
gone
to
prince
but
certainly
the
owner
never
followed
it
there
on
the
next
floor
was
the
noted
for
its
cabinet
of
curiosities
its
small
aquarium
its
large
sofa
its
piano
and
its
inlaid
table
the
back
of
the
was
another
room
beyond
folding
doors
this
would
have
been
convenient
if
a
dance
had
ever
been
given
in
the
house
on
the
other
side
were
the
best
bedroom
and
a
each
in
its
way
what
might
be
expected
save
that
at
the
head
of
the
best
bed
were
two
little
pockets
as
in
the
time
of
our
grandfathers
also
there
was
a
chevalier
and
on
the
a
with
pins
arranged
in
a
pattern
the
and
the
mantelpiece
were
of
white
marble
and
had
on
them
two
white
vases
picked
out
in
bright
green
a
clock
with
a
bronze
upon
it
representing
a
waiter
dressed
up
partly
in
plate
and
partly
in
mail
and
on
the
wall
were
two
jewish
texts
each
translated
into
jacobean
english
and
illuminated
with
a
victorian
illumination
one
said
he
hath
prevented
all
my
ways
the
other
said
wisdom
is
better
than
rubies
but
the
gothic
u
was
ill
made
and
it
looked
like
rabies
there
was
also
in
the
room
a
good
wardrobe
of
a
kind
now
difficult
to
get
made
out
of
cedar
and
very
reasonable
in
arrangement
there
was
moreover
now
it
occurs
to
me
a
little
table
for
writing
on
there
was
writing
paper
with
wood
thorpe
on
it
but
there
were
no
stamps
and
the
ink
was
dry
in
the
bottles
for
there
were
two
bottles
well
now
shall
i
be
at
the
pains
of
telling
you
what
there
was
upstairs
not
i
i
am
tired
enough
as
it
is
of
detailing
all
these
things
i
will
speak
generally
there
were
four
bedrooms
they
were
used
by
the
family
and
above
there
was
an
attic
which
belonged
to
the
servants
the
decoration
of
the
wall
was
everywhere
much
the
same
save
that
it
got
a
little
meaner
as
one
rose
till
at
last
in
the
top
rooms
of
all
there
was
nothing
but
little
photographs
of
sweethearts
or
pictures
out
of
illustrated
papers
stuck
against
the
walls
the
that
had
cost
a
piece
in
the
hall
and
and
in
the
suddenly
began
to
cost
in
the
upper
story
and
the
attic
was
merely
whitewashed
one
thing
more
there
was
a
little
wooden
gate
it
had
been
put
there
when
the
children
were
little
and
had
remained
ever
since
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
why
it
may
have
been
mere
routine
it
may
have
been
romance
the
owner
was
a
practical
man
and
the
little
gate
was
in
the
way
it
was
true
he
never
had
to
shut
and
open
it
on
his
way
to
bed
and
but
rarely
even
saw
it
did
he
leave
it
there
from
a
weak
sentiment
or
from
a
culpable
neglect
he
was
not
a
sentimental
man
on
the
other
hand
he
was
not
negligent
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
on
both
sides
and
it
is
too
late
to
discuss
that
now
heaven
send
us
such
a
house
or
a
house
of
some
kind
but
heaven
send
us
also
the
liberty
to
furnish
it
as
we
choose
for
this
it
was
that
made
the
owner
joy
he
had
done
what
he
liked
in
his
own
surroundings
and
i
very
much
doubt
whether
the
people
who
live
in
queen
anne
houses
or
go
in
for
timber
fronts
can
say
the
same
one
the
illness
of
my
muse
the
other
day
i
noticed
that
my
muse
who
had
long
been
ailing
silent
and
morose
was
showing
signs
of
actual
illness
now
though
it
is
by
no
means
one
of
my
habits
to
coddle
the
dogs
cats
and
other
familiars
of
my
household
yet
my
muse
had
so
pitiful
an
appearance
that
i
determined
to
send
for
the
doctor
but
not
before
i
had
seen
her
to
bed
with
a
hot
bottle
a
good
supper
and
such
other
comforts
as
the
muses
are
accustomed
to
value
all
that
could
be
done
for
the
poor
girl
was
done
thoroughly
a
fine
fire
was
lit
in
her
bedroom
and
a
great
number
of
newspapers
such
as
she
is
given
to
reading
for
her
recreation
were
bought
at
a
neighbouring
shop
when
she
had
drunk
her
wine
and
read
in
their
entirety
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
and
even
the
i
was
glad
to
see
her
sink
into
a
profound
slumber
i
will
confess
that
the
jealousy
which
is
easily
aroused
among
servants
when
one
of
their
number
is
treated
with
any
special
courtesy
gave
me
some
concern
and
i
was
at
the
pains
of
explaining
to
the
household
not
only
the
grave
indisposition
from
which
the
muse
suffered
but
also
the
obligation
i
was
under
to
her
on
account
of
her
virtues
which
were
her
long
and
faithful
service
her
willingness
and
the
excess
of
work
which
she
had
recently
been
compelled
to
perform
her
to
my
astonishment
and
pleasure
entered
at
once
into
the
spirit
of
my
apology
the
maid
offered
to
sit
up
with
her
all
night
or
at
least
until
the
trained
nurse
should
arrive
and
the
groom
of
the
chambers
with
a
good
will
that
i
confess
was
truly
surprising
in
one
of
his
proud
nature
volunteered
to
go
himself
and
order
straw
for
the
street
from
a
neighbouring
stable
the
cause
of
this
affection
which
the
muse
had
aroused
in
the
whole
household
i
subsequently
discovered
to
lie
in
her
own
amiable
and
unselfish
temper
she
had
upon
two
occasions
inspired
the
to
verses
which
had
subsequently
appeared
in
the
and
with
weekly
regularity
she
would
lend
her
aid
to
the
cook
in
the
composition
of
those
technical
reviews
by
which
as
it
seemed
that
domestic
increased
her
ample
wages
the
muse
had
slept
for
a
full
six
hours
when
the
doctor
arrived
a
specialist
in
these
matters
and
one
who
has
before
now
been
called
in
i
am
proud
to
say
by
such
great
persons
as
hichens
churchill
and
roosevelt
when
their
muses
have
been
out
of
sorts
indeed
he
is
that
doctor
who
operated
for
aphasia
upon
the
muse
of
the
late
rossetti
just
before
his
demise
his
fees
are
high
but
i
was
willing
enough
to
pay
and
certainly
would
never
have
consented
as
have
i
regret
to
say
so
many
of
my
unworthy
contemporaries
to
employ
a
veterinary
surgeon
upon
such
an
occasion
the
great
specialist
approached
with
a
determined
air
the
couch
where
the
patient
lay
awoke
her
according
to
the
ancient
formula
and
proceeded
to
question
her
upon
her
symptoms
he
soon
discovered
their
gravity
and
i
could
see
by
his
manner
that
he
was
anxious
to
an
extreme
the
muse
had
grown
so
weak
as
to
be
unable
to
dictate
even
a
little
blank
verse
and
the
indisposition
had
so
far
affected
her
mind
that
she
had
no
memory
of
parnassus
but
deliriously
maintained
that
she
had
been
born
in
the
home
counties
nay
in
the
neighbourhood
of
uxbridge
her
every
phrase
was
a
deplorable
commonplace
and
on
the
physician
applying
a
stethoscope
and
begging
her
to
attempt
some
verse
she
could
give
us
nothing
better
than
a
sonnet
upon
the
expansion
of
the
empire
her
weakness
was
such
that
she
could
do
no
more
than
awake
and
that
feebly
while
she
professed
herself
totally
unable
to
arise
to
expand
to
soar
to
haunt
or
to
perform
any
of
those
exercises
which
are
proper
to
her
profession
when
his
examination
was
concluded
the
doctor
took
me
aside
and
asked
me
upon
what
letters
the
patient
had
recently
fed
i
told
him
upon
the
daily
press
some
of
the
reviews
the
telegrams
from
the
latest
seat
of
war
and
occasionally
a
debate
in
parliament
at
this
he
shook
his
head
and
asked
whether
too
much
had
not
recently
been
asked
of
her
i
admitted
that
she
had
done
a
very
considerable
amount
of
work
for
so
young
a
muse
in
the
past
year
though
its
quality
was
doubtful
and
i
hastened
to
add
that
i
was
the
less
to
blame
as
she
had
wasted
not
a
little
of
her
powers
upon
others
without
asking
my
leave
notably
upon
the
and
the
cook
the
doctor
was
then
good
enough
to
write
out
a
prescription
in
latin
and
to
add
such
general
recommendations
as
are
commonly
of
more
value
than
physic
she
was
to
keep
her
bed
to
be
allowed
no
modern
literature
of
any
kind
unless
milton
and
swift
may
be
admitted
as
moderns
and
even
these
authors
and
their
predecessors
were
to
be
admitted
in
very
sparing
quantities
if
any
signs
of
inversion
archaism
or
neologistic
tendencies
appeared
he
was
to
be
summoned
at
once
but
of
these
he
added
he
had
little
fear
he
did
not
doubt
that
in
a
few
weeks
we
should
have
her
up
and
about
again
but
he
warned
me
against
letting
her
begin
work
too
soon
i
would
not
he
said
permit
her
to
undertake
any
effort
until
she
can
inspire
within
one
day
of
twelve
hours
at
least
eighteen
quatrains
and
those
lucid
grammatical
and
moving
as
for
single
lines
tags
fine
phrases
and
the
rest
they
are
no
sign
whatever
of
returning
health
if
anything
of
the
contrary
he
also
begged
that
she
might
not
be
allowed
any
greek
or
latin
for
ten
days
but
i
reassured
him
upon
the
matter
by
telling
him
that
she
was
totally
unacquainted
with
those
languages
at
which
he
expressed
some
pleasure
but
even
more
astonishment
at
last
he
told
me
that
he
was
compelled
to
be
gone
the
season
had
been
very
hard
nor
had
he
known
so
general
a
breakdown
among
the
muses
of
his
various
clients
i
thought
it
polite
as
i
took
him
to
the
door
to
ask
after
some
of
his
more
distinguished
patients
he
was
glad
to
say
that
the
archbishop
of
armagh
was
very
vigorous
indeed
in
spite
of
the
age
of
her
illustrious
master
he
had
rarely
known
a
more
inventive
or
courageous
female
but
when
as
i
handed
him
into
his
carriage
i
asked
after
that
of
kipling
his
face
became
suddenly
grave
and
he
asked
me
have
you
not
heard
no
said
i
but
i
had
a
fatal
presentiment
of
what
was
to
follow
and
indeed
i
was
almost
prepared
for
it
when
he
answered
in
solemn
tones
she
is
dead
on
a
dog
and
a
man
also
there
lives
in
the
middle
of
the
weald
upon
the
northern
edge
of
a
small
wood
where
a
steep
brow
of
orchard
pasture
goes
down
to
a
little
river
a
recluse
who
is
of
middle
age
and
possessed
of
all
the
ordinary
accomplishments
that
is
french
and
english
literature
are
familiar
to
him
he
can
himself
compose
he
has
read
his
classical
latin
and
can
easily
decipher
such
greek
as
he
has
been
taught
in
youth
he
is
unmarried
he
is
by
birth
a
gentleman
he
enjoys
an
income
sufficient
to
give
him
food
and
wine
and
has
for
companion
a
dog
who
by
the
standard
of
dogs
is
somewhat
more
elderly
than
himself
this
dog
is
called
argus
not
that
he
has
a
hundred
eyes
nor
even
two
indeed
he
has
but
one
for
the
other
or
right
eye
he
lost
the
sight
of
long
ago
from
luxury
and
lack
of
exercise
this
dog
argus
is
neither
small
nor
large
he
is
brown
in
colour
and
covered
though
now
but
partially
with
curly
hair
in
this
he
resembles
many
other
dogs
but
he
differs
from
most
of
his
breed
in
a
further
character
which
is
that
by
long
association
with
a
recluse
he
has
acquired
a
human
manner
that
is
unholy
he
is
fond
of
affected
poses
when
he
sleeps
it
is
with
that
abandonment
of
fatigue
only
naturally
to
be
found
in
mankind
he
watches
sunsets
and
listens
mournfully
to
music
cooked
food
is
dearer
to
him
than
raw
and
he
will
eat
nuts
a
monstrous
thing
in
a
dog
and
proof
of
corruption
nevertheless
or
rather
on
account
of
all
this
the
dog
argus
is
exceedingly
dear
to
his
master
and
of
both
i
had
the
other
day
a
singular
revelation
when
i
set
out
at
evening
to
call
upon
my
friend
the
sun
had
set
but
the
air
was
still
clear
and
it
was
light
enough
to
have
shot
a
bat
had
there
been
bats
about
and
had
one
had
a
gun
when
i
knocked
at
the
cottage
door
and
opened
it
right
within
one
comes
to
the
first
of
the
three
rooms
which
the
recluse
possesses
and
there
i
found
him
tenderly
nursing
the
dog
argus
who
lay
groaning
in
the
and
putting
on
all
the
airs
of
a
christian
man
at
the
point
of
death
the
recluse
did
not
even
greet
me
but
asked
me
only
in
a
hurried
way
how
i
thought
the
dog
argus
looked
i
answered
gravely
and
in
a
low
tone
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
sufferer
that
as
i
had
not
seen
him
since
tuesday
when
he
was
for
an
elderly
dog
in
the
best
of
health
he
certainly
presented
a
sad
contrast
but
that
perhaps
he
was
better
than
he
had
been
some
few
hours
before
and
that
the
recluse
himself
would
be
the
best
judge
of
that
my
friend
was
greatly
relieved
at
what
i
said
and
told
me
that
he
thought
the
dog
was
better
compared
at
least
with
that
same
morning
then
whether
you
believe
it
or
not
he
took
him
by
the
left
leg
just
above
the
paw
and
held
it
for
a
little
time
as
though
he
were
feeling
a
pulse
and
said
he
came
back
less
than
hours
ago
it
seemed
that
the
dog
argus
for
the
first
time
in
fourteen
years
had
run
away
and
that
for
the
first
time
in
perhaps
twenty
or
thirty
years
the
emotion
of
loss
had
entered
into
the
life
of
the
recluse
and
that
he
had
felt
something
outside
books
and
outside
the
contemplation
of
the
landscape
about
his
hermitage
in
a
short
time
the
dog
fell
into
a
slumber
as
was
shown
by
a
number
of
grunts
and
yaps
which
proved
his
sleep
for
the
dog
argus
is
of
that
kind
which
hunts
in
dreams
his
master
covered
him
reverently
rather
than
gently
with
an
indian
cloth
and
still
leaving
him
in
the
armchair
sat
down
upon
a
common
wooden
chair
close
by
and
gazed
pitifully
at
the
fire
for
my
part
i
stood
up
and
wondered
at
them
both
and
wondered
also
at
that
in
man
by
which
he
must
attach
himself
to
something
even
if
it
be
but
a
dog
a
politician
or
an
ungrateful
child
when
he
had
gazed
at
the
fire
a
little
while
the
recluse
began
to
talk
and
i
listened
to
him
talking
even
if
they
had
not
dug
up
so
much
earth
to
prove
it
i
should
have
known
said
he
that
the
odyssey
was
written
not
at
the
beginning
of
a
civilisation
nor
in
the
splendour
of
it
but
towards
its
close
i
do
not
say
this
from
the
evening
light
that
shines
across
its
pages
for
that
is
common
to
all
profound
work
but
i
say
it
because
of
the
animals
and
especially
because
of
the
dog
who
was
the
only
one
to
know
his
master
when
that
master
came
home
a
beggar
to
his
own
land
before
his
youth
was
restored
to
him
and
before
he
got
back
his
women
and
his
kingship
by
the
bending
of
his
bow
and
before
he
hanged
the
housemaids
and
killed
all
those
who
had
despised
him
but
how
said
i
for
i
am
younger
than
he
can
the
animals
in
the
poem
show
you
that
the
poem
belongs
to
a
decline
why
said
he
because
at
the
end
of
a
great
civilisation
the
air
gets
empty
the
light
goes
out
of
the
sky
the
gods
depart
and
men
in
their
loneliness
put
out
a
groping
hand
catching
at
the
friendship
of
and
trying
to
understand
whatever
lives
and
suffers
as
they
do
you
will
find
it
never
fail
that
where
a
passionate
regard
for
the
animals
about
us
or
even
a
great
tenderness
for
them
is
to
be
found
there
is
also
to
be
found
decay
in
the
state
i
hope
not
said
i
moreover
it
can
not
be
true
for
in
the
thirteenth
century
which
was
certainly
the
healthiest
time
we
ever
had
animals
were
understood
and
i
will
prove
it
to
you
in
several
carvings
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
shook
his
head
saying
in
the
rough
and
in
general
it
is
true
and
the
reason
is
the
reason
i
have
given
you
that
when
decay
begins
whether
of
a
man
or
of
a
state
there
comes
with
it
an
appalling
and
a
torturing
loneliness
in
which
our
energies
decline
into
a
strong
affection
for
whatever
is
constantly
our
companion
and
for
whatever
is
certainly
present
upon
earth
for
we
have
lost
the
sky
then
if
the
senses
are
so
powerful
in
a
decline
of
the
state
there
should
come
at
the
same
time
said
i
a
quick
forgetfulness
of
the
human
dead
and
an
easy
change
of
human
friendship
there
does
he
answered
and
to
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
i
know
it
by
my
own
experience
he
continued
when
yesterday
at
sunset
i
looked
for
my
dog
argus
and
could
not
find
him
i
went
out
into
the
wood
and
called
him
the
darkness
came
and
i
found
no
trace
of
him
i
did
not
hear
him
barking
far
off
as
i
have
heard
him
before
when
he
was
younger
and
went
hunting
for
a
while
and
three
times
that
night
i
came
back
out
of
the
wild
into
the
warmth
of
my
house
making
sure
he
would
have
returned
but
he
was
never
there
the
third
time
i
had
gone
a
mile
out
to
the
gamekeeper
to
give
him
money
if
argus
should
be
found
and
i
asked
him
as
many
questions
and
as
foolish
as
a
woman
would
ask
then
i
sat
up
right
into
the
night
thinking
that
every
movement
of
the
wind
outside
or
of
the
drip
of
water
was
the
little
pad
of
his
step
coming
up
the
flagstones
to
the
door
i
was
even
in
the
mood
when
men
see
unreal
things
and
twice
i
thought
i
saw
him
passing
quickly
between
my
chair
and
the
passage
to
the
further
room
but
these
things
are
proper
to
the
night
and
the
strongest
thing
i
suffered
for
him
was
in
the
morning
it
was
as
you
know
very
bitterly
cold
for
several
days
they
found
things
dead
in
the
hedgerows
and
there
was
perhaps
no
running
water
between
here
and
the
downs
there
was
no
shelter
from
the
snow
there
was
no
cover
for
my
friend
at
all
and
when
i
was
up
at
dawn
with
the
faint
light
about
a
driving
wind
full
of
sleet
filled
all
the
air
then
i
made
certain
that
the
dog
argus
was
dead
and
what
was
worse
that
i
should
not
find
his
body
that
the
old
dog
had
got
caught
in
some
snare
or
that
his
strength
had
failed
him
through
the
cold
as
it
fails
us
human
beings
also
upon
such
nights
striking
at
the
heart
though
i
was
certain
that
i
would
not
see
him
again
yet
i
went
on
foolishly
and
aimlessly
enough
plunging
through
the
snow
from
one
spinney
to
another
and
hoping
that
i
might
hear
a
whine
i
heard
none
and
if
the
little
trail
he
had
made
in
his
departure
might
have
been
seen
in
the
evening
long
before
that
morning
the
drift
would
have
covered
it
i
had
eaten
nothing
and
yet
it
was
near
noon
when
i
returned
pushing
forward
to
the
cottage
against
the
pressure
of
the
storm
when
i
found
there
miserably
crouched
trembling
half
dead
in
the
lee
of
a
little
thick
yew
beside
my
door
the
dog
argus
and
as
i
came
his
tail
just
wagged
and
he
just
moved
his
ears
but
he
had
not
the
strength
to
come
near
me
his

i
carried
him
in
and
put
him
here
feeding
him
by
force
and
i
have
restored
him
all
this
the
recluse
said
to
me
with
as
deep
and
as
restrained
emotion
as
though
he
had
been
speaking
of
the
most
sacred
things
as
indeed
for
him
these
things
were
sacred
it
was
therefore
a
mere
inadvertence
in
me
and
an
untrained
habit
of
thinking
aloud
which
made
me
say
good
heavens
what
will
you
do
when
the
dog
argus
dies
at
once
i
wished
i
had
not
said
it
for
i
could
see
that
the
recluse
could
not
bear
the
words
i
looked
therefore
a
little
awkwardly
beyond
him
and
was
pleased
to
see
the
dog
argus
lazily
opening
his
one
eye
and
surveying
me
with
torpor
and
with
contempt
he
was
certainly
less
moved
than
his
master
then
in
my
heart
i
prayed
that
of
these
two
unless
the
god
would
make
them
both
immortal
and
catch
them
up
into
whatever
place
is
better
than
the
weald
or
unless
he
would
grant
them
one
death
together
upon
one
day
that
the
dog
argus
might
survive
my
friend
and
that
the
recluse
might
be
the
first
to
dissolve
that
long
companionship
for
of
this
i
am
certain
that
the
dog
would
suffer
less
for
men
love
their
dependents
much
more
than
do
their
dependents
them
and
this
is
especially
true
of
brutes
for
men
are
nearer
to
the
gods
on
tea
when
i
was
a
boy
what
a
phrase
what
memories
o
noctes
coenasque
deÃ»m
why
then
is
there
something
in
man
that
wholly
perishes
it
is
against
sound
religion
to
believe
it
but
the
world
would
lead
one
to
imagine
it
the
hills
are
there
i
see
them
as
i
write
they
are
the
cloud
or
wall
that
dignified
my
sixteenth
year
and
the
river
is
there
and
flows
by
that
same
meadow
beyond
my
door
from
above
coldwatham
the
same
vast
horizon
opens
westward
in
waves
of
receding
crests
more
changeable
and
more
immense
than
is
even
our
sea
the
same
sunsets
at
times
bring
it
all
in
splendour
for
whatever
herds
the
western
clouds
together
in
our
stormy
evenings
is
as
stable
and
as
vigorous
as
the
county
itself
if
therefore
there
is
something
gone
it
is
i
that
have
lost
it
certainly
something
is
diminished
the
priests
and
the
tradition
of
the
west
forbid
me
to
say
that
the
soul
can
perish
certainly
something
is
diminished
what
well
i
do
not
know
its
name
nor
has
anyone
known
it
face
to
face
or
apprehended
it
in
this
life
but
the
sense
and
influence
alas
especially
the
memory
of
it
lies
in
the
words
when
i
was
a
boy
and
if
i
write
those
words
again
in
any
document
whatsoever
even
in
a
lawyer
letter
without
admitting
at
once
a
and
galloping
parenthesis
may
the
seven
devils
of
sense
take
away
the
last
remnant
of
the
joy
they
lend
me
when
i
was
a
boy
there
was
nothing
all
about
the
village
or
the
woods
that
had
not
its
living
god
and
all
these
gods
were
good
oh
how
the
county
and
its
air
shone
from
within
what
meaning
lay
in
unexpected
glimpses
of
far
horizons
what
a
friend
one
was
with
the
clouds
well
all
i
can
say
to
the
theologians
is
this
i
will
grant
you
that
the
soul
does
not
decay
you
know
more
of
such
flimsy
things
than
i
do
but
you
on
your
side
must
grant
me
that
there
is
something
which
does
not
enter
into
your
systems
that
has
perished
and
i
mean
to
mourn
it
all
the
days
of
my
life
pray
do
not
interfere
with
that
peculiar
ritual
when
i
was
a
boy
i
knew
nature
as
a
child
knows
its
nurse
and
tea
i
denounced
for
a
drug
i
found
to
support
this
fine
instinct
many
arguments
all
of
which
are
still
sound
though
not
one
of
them
would
prevent
me
now
from
drinking
my
twentieth
cup
it
was
introduced
late
and
during
a
corrupt
period
it
was
an
exotic
it
was
a
sham
exhilarant
to
which
fatal
reactions
could
not
but
attach
it
was
no
part
of
the
diet
of
the
natural
man
the
two
nations
that
alone
consume
it
the
english
and
the
chinese
are
become
by
its
baneful
influence
on
the
imagination
the
most
easily
deceived
in
the
world
their
politics
are
a
mass
of
bombastic
illusions
also
it
dries
their
skins
it
tans
the
liver
hardens
the
coats
of
the
stomach
makes
the
brain
feverishly
active
rots
the
all
that
is
still
true
nevertheless
i
now
drink
it
and
shall
drink
it
for
of
all
the
effects
of
age
none
is
more
profound
than
this
that
it
leads
men
to
the
worship
of
some
one
spirit
less
erect
than
the
angels
a
care
an
egotism
an
irritability
with
regard
to
details
an
anxious
craving
a
consummate
satisfaction
in
the
performance
of
the
due
rites
an
ecstasy
of
habit
all
proclaim
the
senile
heresy
the
material
religion
i
confess
to
tea
all
is
arranged
in
this
cult
with
the
precision
of
an
ancient
creed
the
matter
of
the
sacrifice
must
come
from
china
he
that
would
drink
indian
tea
would
smoke
hay
the
pot
must
be
of
metal
and
the
metal
must
be
a
white
metal
not
gold
or
iron
who
has
not
known
the
acidity
and
paucity
of
tea
from
a
or
golden
spout
the
pot
must
first
be
warmed
by
pouring
in
a
little
water
the
word
should
always
be
underlined
then
the
water
is
poured
away
and
a
few
words
are
said
then
the
tea
is
put
in
and
unrolls
and
spreads
in
the
steam
then
in
due
order
on
these
expanding
leaves
water
is
largely
poured
and
the
god
arises
worthy
of
continual
but
evil
praise
and
of
the
thanks
of
the
vicious
a
deity
for
the
moment
deceitfully
kindly
to
men
under
his
influence
the
whole
mind
receives
a
sharp
vision
of
power
it
is
a
phantasm
and
a
cheat
men
can
do
wonders
through
wine
through
tea
they
only
think
themselves
great
and
clear
but
that
is
enough
if
one
has
bound
oneself
to
that
strange
idol
and
learnt
the
magic
phrase
on
his
pedestal
greek
ariston
men
ti
for
of
all
the
illusions
and
dreams
men
cherish
none
is
so
grandiose
as
the
illusion
of
conscious
power
within
well
then
it
fades
i
begin
to
see
that
this
can
not
continue
of
tea
it
came
inconsecutive
and
empty
with
the
influence
of
tea
dissolving
let
these
words
also
dissolve
i
could
wish
it
had
been
opium
or
haschisch
or
even
gin
you
would
have
had
something
more
soaring
for
your
money
vino
veritas
in
aqua
satietas
what
is
the
latin
for
tea
what
is
there
no
latin
word
for
tea
upon
my
soul
if
i
had
known
that
i
would
have
let
the
vulgar
stuff
alone
on
them
i
do
not
like
them
it
is
no
good
asking
me
why
though
i
have
plenty
of
reasons
i
do
not
like
them
there
would
be
no
particular
point
in
saying
i
do
not
like
them
if
it
were
not
that
so
many
people
doted
on
them
and
when
one
hears
them
praised
it
goads
one
to
expressing
one
hatred
and
fear
of
them
i
know
very
well
that
they
can
do
one
harm
and
that
they
have
occult
powers
all
the
world
has
known
that
for
a
hundred
thousand
years
more
or
less
and
every
attempt
has
been
made
to
propitiate
them
james
would
drown
their
mistress
or
burn
her
but
were
spared
men
would
mummify
them
in
egypt
and
worship
the
mummies
men
would
carve
them
in
stone
in
cyprus
and
crete
and
asia
minor
or
more
remarkable
still
artists
especially
in
the
western
empire
would
leave
them
out
altogether
so
much
was
their
influence
dreaded
well
i
yield
so
far
as
not
to
print
their
name
and
only
to
call
them
they
but
i
hate
them
and
i
not
afraid
to
say
so
if
you
will
take
a
little
list
of
the
chief
crimes
that
living
beings
can
commit
you
will
find
that
they
commit
them
all
and
they
are
cruel
cruelty
is
even
in
their
tread
and
expression
they
are
hatefully
cruel
i
saw
one
of
them
catch
a
mouse
the
other
day
the
cat
is
now
out
of
the
bag
and
it
was
a
very
much
more
sickening
sight
i
fancy
than
ordinary
murder
you
may
imagine
that
they
catch
mice
to
eat
them
it
is
not
so
they
catch
mice
to
torture
them
and
what
is
worse
they
will
teach
this
to
their
children
their
children
who
are
naturally
innocent
and
fat
and
full
of
goodness
are
deliberately
and
systematically
corrupted
by
them
there
is
diabolism
in
it
other
beings
i
include
mankind
will
be
gluttonous
but
gluttonous
spasmodically
or
with
a
method
or
shamefacedly
or
in
some
way
or
another
that
qualifies
the
vice
not
so
they
they
are
gluttonous
always
and
upon
all
occasions
and
in
every
place
and
for
ever
it
was
only
last
vigil
of
all
fools
day
when
myself
fasting
i
filled
up
the
saucer
seven
times
with
milk
and
seven
times
it
was
emptied
and
there
went
up
the
most
peevish
querulous
vicious
complaint
and
demand
for
an
eighth
they
will
eat
some
part
of
the
food
of
all
that
are
in
the
house
now
even
a
child
the
most
gluttonous
one
would
think
of
all
living
creatures
would
not
do
that
it
makes
a
selection
do
not
will
drink
beer
this
is
not
a
theory
i
know
it
i
have
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
they
will
eat
special
foods
they
will
even
eat
dry
bread
here
again
i
have
personal
evidence
of
the
fact
they
will
eat
the
dog
biscuits
but
never
upon
any
occasion
will
they
eat
anything
that
has
been
poisoned
so
utterly
lacking
are
they
in
simplicity
and
humility
and
so
abominably
well
filled
with
cunning
by
whatever
demon
first
brought
their
race
into
existence
they
also
alone
of
all
creation
love
hateful
noises
some
beings
indeed
and
i
count
man
among
them
can
not
help
the
voice
with
which
they
have
been
endowed
but
they
know
that
it
is
offensive
and
are
at
pains
to
make
it
better
others
such
as
the
peacock
or
the
elephant
also
know
that
their
cry
is
unpleasant
they
therefore
use
it
sparingly
others
again
the
dove
the
nightingale
the
thrush
know
that
their
voices
are
very
pleasant
and
entertain
us
with
them
all
day
and
all
night
long
but
they
know
that
their
voices
are
the
most
hideous
of
all
the
sounds
in
the
world
and
knowing
this
they
perpetually
insist
upon
thrusting
those
voices
upon
us
saying
as
it
were
i
am
giving
myself
pain
but
i
am
giving
you
more
pain
and
therefore
i
shall
go
on
and
they
choose
for
the
place
where
this
pain
shall
be
given
exact
and
elevated
situations
very
close
to
our
ears
is
there
any
need
for
me
to
point
out
that
in
every
city
they
will
begin
their
wicked
jar
just
at
the
time
when
its
inhabitants
must
sleep
in
london
you
will
not
hear
it
till
after
midnight
in
the
county
towns
it
begins
at
ten
in
remote
villages
as
early
as
nine
their
master
also
protects
them
they
have
a
charmed
life
i
have
seen
one
thrown
from
a
great
height
into
a
london
street
which
when
it
reached
it
it
walked
quietly
away
with
the
dignity
of
the
lost
world
to
which
it
belonged
if
one
had
the
time
one
could
watch
them
day
after
day
and
never
see
them
do
a
single
kind
or
good
thing
or
be
moved
by
a
single
virtuous
impulse
they
have
no
gesture
for
the
expression
of
admiration
love
reverence
or
ecstasy
they
have
but
one
method
of
expressing
content
and
they
reserve
that
for
moments
of
physical
repletion
the
tail
which
is
in
all
other
animals
the
signal
for
joy
or
for
defence
or
for
mere
usefulness
or
for
a
noble
anger
is
with
them
agitated
only
to
express
a
sullen
discontent
all
that
they
do
is
venomous
and
all
that
they
think
is
evil
and
when
i
take
mine
away
as
i
mean
to
do
next
week
in
a
basket
i
shall
first
read
in
a
book
of
statistics
what
is
the
wickedest
part
of
london
and
i
shall
leave
it
there
for
i
know
of
no
one
even
among
my
neighbours
quite
so
vile
as
to
deserve
such
a
gift
on
railways
and
things
railways
have
changed
the
arrangement
and
distribution
of
crowds
and
solitude
but
have
done
nothing
to
disturb
the
essential
contrast
between
them
the
more
behindhand
of
my
friends
among
whom
i
count
the
weary
men
of
the
towns
are
ceaselessly
bewailing
the
effect
of
railways
and
the
spoiling
of
the
country
nor
do
i
fail
when
i
hear
such
complaints
to
point
out
their
error
courteously
to
hint
at
their
qualities
and
with
all
the
delicacy
imaginable
to
let
them
understand
they
are
no
better
than
machines
repeating
formulae
through
the
nose
the
railways
and
those
slow
lumbering
things
the
steamboats
have
not
spoilt
our
solitudes
on
the
contrary
they
have
intensified
the
quiet
of
the
older
haunts
they
have
created
new
sanctuaries
and
crowning
blessing
they
make
it
easy
for
us
to
reach
our
refuges
for
in
the
first
place
you
will
notice
that
new
lines
of
travel
are
like
canals
cut
through
the
stagnant
marsh
of
an
old
civilisation
draining
it
of
populace
and
worry
and
concentrating
upon
themselves
the
odious
pressure
of
humanity
you
know
to
adopt
the
easy
or
conversational
style
that
you
and
i
belong
to
a
happy
minority
we
are
the
sons
of
the
hunters
and
the
wandering
singers
and
from
our
boyhood
nothing
ever
gave
us
greater
pleasure
than
to
stand
under
lonely
skies
in
forest
clearings
or
to
find
a
beach
looking
westward
at
evening
over
unfrequented
seas
but
the
great
mass
of
men
love
companionship
so
much
that
nothing
seems
of
any
worth
compared
with
it
human
communion
is
their
meat
and
drink
and
so
they
use
the
railways
to
make
bigger
and
bigger
hives
for
themselves
now
take
the
true
modern
citizen
the
usurer
how
does
the
usurer
suck
the
extremest
pleasure
out
of
his
holiday
he
takes
the
train
preferably
at
a
very
central
station
near
the
strand
and
if
he
can
choose
his
time
on
a
foggy
and
dirty
day
he
picks
out
an
express
that
will
take
him
with
the
greatest
speed
through
the
garden
of
eden
nor
does
he
begin
to
feel
the
full
savour
of
relaxation
till
a
row
of
abominable
villas
appears
on
the
southern
slope
of
what
were
once
the
downs
these
villas
stand
like
the
skirmishers
of
a
foul
army
deployed
he
is
immediately
whirled
into
brighton
and
is
at
peace
there
he
has
his
wish
for
three
days
there
he
can
never
see
anything
but
houses
or
if
he
has
to
walk
along
the
sea
he
can
rest
his
eye
on
herds
of
unhappy
people
and
huge
advertisements
and
he
can
hear
the
newspaper
boys
telling
lies
perhaps
special
lies
he
has
paid
for
at
the
top
of
their
voices
he
can
note
as
evening
draws
on
the
pleasant
glare
of
gas
upon
the
street
mud
and
there
pass
him
the
familiar
surroundings
of
servility
abject
poverty
drunkenness
misery
and
vice
he
has
his
on
the
saturday
evening
with
the
sharp
peculiar
finish
of
the
london
accent
in
the
patriotic
song
he
has
the
london
paper
on
sunday
to
tell
him
that
his
nastiest
little
colonial
war
was
a
crusade
and
on
monday
morning
he
has
the
familiar
feeling
that
follows
his
excesses
of
the
previous
day
are
you
not
glad
that
such
men
and
their
swarm
by
hundreds
of
thousands
into
the
resorts
do
you
not
bless
the
railways
that
take
them
so
quickly
from
one
hell
to
another
never
let
me
hear
you
say
that
the
railways
spoil
a
countryside
they
do
it
is
true
spoil
this
or
that
particular
place
as
for
example
crewe
brighton
but
for
this
disadvantage
they
give
us
i
know
not
how
many
delights
what
is
more
english
than
the
country
railway
station
i
defy
the
eighteenth
century
to
produce
anything
more
english
more
full
of
home
and
rest
and
the
nature
of
the
country
than
my
junction
trains
a
day
stop
at
it
or
start
from
it
it
serves
even
the
expresses
smith
monopoly
has
a
bookstall
there
you
can
get
cheap
kipling
and
harmsworth
to
any
extent
and
yet
it
is
a
theme
for
english
idylls
the
porter
whom
i
have
known
from
childhood
the
who
ranges
us
all
in
ranks
beginning
with
the
duke
and
ending
with
a
sad
frayed
and
literary
man
the
little
chaise
in
which
the
two
old
ladies
from
barlton
drive
up
to
get
their
paper
of
an
evening
the
servant
from
the
inn
the
newsboy
whose
mother
keeps
a
sweetshop
they
are
all
my
village
friends
the
glorious
sussex
accent
whose
only
vowel
is
the
broad
a
grows
but
more
rich
and
emphatic
from
the
necessity
of
impressing
itself
upon
foreign
intruders
the
smoke
also
of
the
train
as
it
skirts
the
downs
is
part
and
parcel
of
what
has
become
thanks
to
the
trains
our
encloistered
country
life
the
smoke
of
the
trains
is
a
little
smudge
of
human
activity
which
permits
us
to
match
our
incomparable
seclusion
with
the
from
which
we
have
fled
upon
my
soul
when
i
climb
up
the
beacon
to
read
my
book
on
the
warm
turf
the
sight
of
an
engine
coming
through
the
cutting
is
an
emphasis
of
my
selfish
enjoyment
i
say
there
goes
the
brighton
train
but
the
image
of
brighton
with
its
and
its
vision
of
empire
does
not
oppress
me
it
is
a
thing
its
life
ebbs
and
flows
along
that
belt
of
iron
to
distances
that
do
not
regard
me
consider
this
also
with
regard
to
my
railway
it
brings
me
what
i
want
in
order
to
be
perfect
in
my
isolation
those
books
discussing
problems
whether
or
not
there
is
such
an
idea
as
right
the
inconvenience
of
being
married
the
worry
of
being
atheist
and
yet
living
upon
a
clerical
endowment
these
fine
discussions
come
from
a
library
in
a
box
by
train
and
i
can
torture
myself
for
a
shilling
whereas
before
the
railways
i
should
have
had
to
fall
back
on
the
and
the
county
history
in
the
way
of
newspapers
it
provides
me
with
just
the
companionship
necessary
to
a
hermitage
often
and
often
after
getting
through
one
paper
i
stroll
down
to
the
junction
and
buy
fifteen
others
and
so
enjoy
the
fruits
of
many
minds
thanks
to
my
railway
i
can
sit
in
the
garden
of
an
evening
and
read
my
paper
as
i
smoke
my
pipe
and
say
ah
that
buggin
work
i
remember
him
well
he
worked
for
rhodes
hullo
here
simpson
at
it
again
since
when
did
they
buy
and
so
forth
i
lead
my
pastoral
life
happy
in
the
general
world
about
me
and
i
serve
as
sauce
to
such
healthy
meat
the
piquant
wickedness
of
the
town
nor
do
i
ever
note
a
cowardice
a
lie
a
bribery
or
a
breach
of
trust
a
surrender
in
the
field
or
a
new
peerage
but
i
remember
that
my
newspaper
could
not
add
these
refining
influences
to
my
life
but
for
the
which
i
set
out
to
praise
at
the
beginning
of
this
and
intend
to
praise
manfully
to
the
end
yet
another
good
we
owe
to
railways
occurs
to
me
they
keep
the
small
towns
going
do
pester
me
with
economics
on
that
point
i
know
more
economics
than
you
and
i
say
that
but
for
the
railways
the
small
towns
would
have
gone
to
pieces
there
never
yet
was
a
civilisation
growing
richer
and
improving
its
high
roads
in
which
the
small
towns
did
not
dwindle
the
village
supplied
the
local
market
with
bodily
necessaries
the
intellectual
life
the
civic
necessities
had
to
go
into
the
large
towns
it
happened
in
the
second
and
third
centuries
in
italy
it
happened
in
france
between
henri
iv
and
the
revolution
it
was
happening
here
before
take
those
little
paradises
ludlow
and
leominster
consider
arundel
and
please
your
memory
with
the
admirable
slopes
of
whitchurch
grow
contented
in
a
vision
of
ledbury
of
rye
or
of
abingdon
or
of
beccles
with
its
big
church
over
the
river
or
of
newport
in
the
isle
of
wight
or
of
king
lynn
or
of
lymington
you
would
not
have
any
of
these
but
for
the
railway
and
there
are
such
in
england
one
for
every
tolerable
man
valognes
in
the
cotentin
down
in
the
dauphinÃ©
in
its
vast
theatre
of
upright
hills
julien
in
the
limousin
puy
who
does
not
connect
beauty
with
the
word
mansle
in
the
charente
country
they
had
all
been
half
dead
for
over
a
century
when
the
railway
came
to
them
and
made
them
jolly
little
trim
decent
worthy
satisfactory
genial
comforting
and
human
greek
politeiae
with
clergy
upper
class
middle
class
poor
soldiers
yesterday
news
a
college
men
fools
strong
riders
old
maids
and
all
that
makes
a
state
in
england
the
railway
brought
in
that
beneficent
class
the
gentlemen
in
france
that
still
more
beneficent
class
the
haute
bourgeoisie
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
you
are
going
to
say
that
there
were
squires
before
the
railways
in
england
pray
have
you
considered
how
many
squires
there
were
to
go
round
about
half
a
dozen
squires
to
every
town
that
is
say
four
gentlemen
and
of
those
four
gentlemen
let
us
say
two
took
some
interest
in
the
place
it
was
good
enough
and
heaven
help
the
country
towns
now
if
they
had
to
depend
on
the
great
houses
there
would
be
a
smart
once
a
day
with
a
small
vicious
and
servile
groom
in
it
an
actor
a
foreign
a
popular
novelist
or
a
newspaper
owner
jumping
out
to
make
his
purchases
and
driving
back
again
to
his
host
within
the
hour
no
no
what
makes
the
country
town
is
the
army
the
navy
the
church
and
the
law
especially
the
retired
ones
then
think
of
the
way
in
which
the
railways
keep
a
good
influence
in
a
place
and
a
bad
man
out
of
it
your
good
man
loves
a
country
town
but
he
must
think
and
read
and
meet
people
so
in
the
last
century
he
regretfully
took
a
town
house
and
had
his
little
house
in
the
country
as
well
now
he
lives
in
the
country
and
runs
up
to
town
when
he
likes
he
is
always
a
permanent
influence
in
the
little
city
especially
if
he
has
but
a
year
which
is
the
normal
income
of
a
retired
gentleman
yes
it
is
so
and
if
you
think
it
is
too
small
an
estimate
come
with
me
some
day
and
make
an
inquisitorial
tour
of
my
town
as
for
the
vulgar
and
cowardly
man
he
hates
small
towns
fancy
a
south
african
financier
in
a
small
town
well
the
railway
takes
him
away
of
old
he
might
have
had
to
stay
there
or
starve
now
he
goes
to
london
and
runs
a
rag
or
goes
into
parliament
or
goes
to
dances
dressed
up
in
imitation
of
a
soldier
or
he
goes
to
texas
and
gets
hanged
it
all
one
to
me
he
out
of
my
town
and
as
the
railways
have
increased
the
local
refinement
and
virtue
so
they
have
ennobled
and
given
body
to
the
local
dignitary
what
would
the
bishop
of
caen
he
calls
himself
bishop
of
lisieux
and
bayeux
but
that
is
archaeological
pedantry
what
i
say
would
the
bishop
of
caen
be
without
his
railway
a
phantom
or
a
paris
magnate
what
the
mayor
of
high
wycombe
ah
what
indeed
but
i
can
not
waste
any
more
of
this
time
of
mine
in
discussing
one
aspect
of
the
railway
what
further
i
have
to
say
on
the
subject
shall
be
presented
in
due
course
in
my
book
on
small
town
of
footnote
small
town
of
christendom
an
analytical
with
an
introduction
by
joseph
reinach
ulmo
et
nett
i
will
close
this
series
of
observations
with
a
little
list
of
benefits
the
railway
gives
you
many
of
which
would
not
have
occurred
to
you
but
for
my
ingenuity
some
of
which
you
may
have
thought
of
at
some
moment
or
other
and
yet
would
never
have
retained
but
for
my
patient
labour
in
this
the
railway
gives
you
seclusion
if
you
are
in
an
express
alone
you
are
in
the
only
spot
in
western
europe
where
you
can
be
certain
of
two
or
three
hours
to
yourself
at
home
in
the
dead
of
night
you
may
be
wakened
by
a
policeman
or
a
or
a
dog
the
heaths
are
populous
you
can
not
climb
to
the
very
top
of
helvellyn
to
read
your
own
poetry
to
yourself
without
the
fear
of
a
tourist
but
in
the
corner
of
a
going
north
or
west
you
can
be
sure
of
your
own
company
the
best
the
most
sympathetic
the
most
brilliant
in
the
world
the
railway
gives
you
sharp
change
and
what
we
need
in
change
is
surely
keenness
for
instance
if
one
wanted
to
go
sailing
in
the
old
days
one
left
london
had
a
bleak
drive
in
the
country
got
nearer
and
nearer
the
sea
felt
the
cold
and
wet
and
discomfort
growing
on
one
and
after
half
a
day
or
a
day
gradual
introduction
to
the
thing
one
would
at
last
have
got
on
deck
wet
and
wretched
and
half
the
fun
over
nowadays
what
happens
why
the
other
day
a
rich
man
was
sitting
in
london
with
a
poor
friend
they
were
discussing
what
to
do
in
three
spare
days
they
had
they
said
let
us
sail
they
left
london
in
a
nice
warm
comfortable
swelly
carriage
at
four
and
before
dark
they
were
letting
everything
go
putting
on
the
oilies
driving
through
the
open
in
front
of
it
under
a
storm
jib
praying
hard
for
their
lives
in
last
monday
gale
and
wishing
to
god
they
had
stayed
at
home
all
in
the
four
hours
that
is
what
you
may
call
piquant
it
braces
and
refreshes
a
man
for
the
rest
i
can
not
detail
the
innumerable
minor
advantages
of
railways
the
mild
excitement
which
is
an
antidote
to
gambling
the
shaking
which
in
moderation
is
good
for
livers
the
meeting
familiarly
with
every
kind
of
man
and
talking
politics
to
him
the
delight
in
rapid
motion
the
the
porters
the
solid
guard
the
strenuous
note
this
next
time
you
travel
it
is
an
accurate
observation
and
of
what
other
kind
of
modern
thing
can
it
be
said
that
more
than
half
pay
dividends
thinking
of
these
things
what
sane
and
humorous
man
would
ever
suggest
that
a
part
of
life
so
fertile
in
manifold
and
human
pleasure
should
ever
be
bought
by
the
dull
clique
who
call
themselves
the
state
and
should
yield
under
such
a
scheme
yet
yet
yet
salaries
to
the
younger
sons
on
conversations
in
trains
i
might
have
added
in
this
list
i
have
just
made
of
the
advantages
of
railways
that
railways
let
one
mix
with
one
and
hear
their
continual
conversation
now
if
you
will
think
of
it
railways
are
the
only
institutions
that
give
us
that
advantage
in
other
places
we
avoid
all
save
those
who
resemble
us
and
many
men
become
in
middle
age
like
cabinet
ministers
quite
ignorant
of
their
but
in
trains
if
one
travels
much
one
hears
every
kind
of
man
talking
to
every
other
and
one
perceives
all
england
it
is
on
this
account
that
i
have
always
been
at
pains
to
note
what
i
heard
in
this
way
especially
the
least
expected
most
startling
and
therefore
most
revealing
dialogues
and
as
soon
as
i
could
to
write
them
down
for
in
this
way
one
can
grow
to
know
men
thus
i
have
somewhere
preserved
a
hot
discussion
among
some
miners
in
derbyshire
voters
good
people
voters
remember
whether
the
united
states
were
bound
to
us
as
a
colony
like
egypt
and
i
once
heard
also
a
debate
as
to
whether
the
word
were
horizon
or
horizon
this
ended
in
a
fight
and
the
horizon
man
pushed
the
horizon
man
out
at
skipton
and
would
let
him
get
into
the
carriage
again
then
again
i
once
heard
two
frightfully
rich
men
near
birmingham
arguing
why
england
was
the
richest
and
the
happiest
country
in
the
world
neither
of
these
men
was
a
gentleman
but
they
argued
politely
though
firmly
for
they
differed
profoundly
one
of
them
who
was
almost
too
rich
to
walk
said
it
was
because
we
minded
our
own
affairs
and
respected
property
and
were
this
he
said
was
the
cause
of
our
prosperity
and
of
the
futile
envy
with
which
foreigners
regarded
the
homes
of
our
working
men
not
so
the
other
thought
that
it
was
the
plain
english
sense
of
duty
that
did
the
trick
he
showed
how
this
was
ingrained
in
us
and
appeared
in
our
schoolboys
and
our
police
he
contrasted
it
with
ireland
and
he
asked
what
else
had
made
our
criminal
trials
the
model
of
the
world
all
this
also
i
wrote
down
then
also
once
on
a
long
ride
yes
ride
why
not
through
lincolnshire
i
heard
two
men
of
the
smaller
commercial
or
salaried
kind
at
issue
the
first
who
had
a
rather
peevish
face
was
looking
gloomily
out
of
window
and
was
saying
denmark
has
it
greece
has
it
why
should
we
have
it
eh
america
has
it
and
so
germany
why
should
we
have
it
then
after
a
pause
he
added
even
france
has
it
why
have
we
got
it
he
spoke
as
though
he
would
stand
it
much
longer
and
as
though
france
were
the
last
straw
the
other
man
was
excitable
and
had
an
enormous
newspaper
in
his
hand
and
he
answered
in
a
high
voice
we
too
sensible
that
why
we
know
what
we
about
we
do
the
other
man
said
ho
do
we
the
second
man
answered
yes
we
do
what
made
england
gord
said
the
first
man
this
brought
the
second
man
up
all
standing
and
nearly
carried
away
his
he
answered
slowly
well
yes
in
a
manner
of
speaking
but
what
i
meant
to
say
was
like
this
that
what
made
england
was
free
trade
here
he
slapped
one
hand
on
to
the
other
with
a
noise
like
that
of
a
pistol
and
added
heavily
and
what
more
i
can
prove
it
the
first
man
who
was
now
entrenched
in
his
position
said
again
ho
can
you
and
sneered
the
second
man
then
proved
it
getting
more
and
more
excited
when
he
had
done
all
the
first
man
did
was
to
say
you
talk
foolishness
then
there
was
a
long
silence
very
strained
at
last
the
free
trader
pulled
out
a
pipe
and
filled
it
at
leisure
with
a
light
sort
of
womanish
tobacco
and
just
as
he
struck
a
match
the
protectionist
shouted
out
no
you
do
this
ai
a
smoking
compartment
i
object
the
free
trader
said
o
that
how
it
is
is
it
the
protectionist
answered
in
a
lower
voice
and
surly
yes
how
they
sat
avoiding
each
other
eyes
till
we
got
to
grantham
i
had
no
idea
that
feeling
could
run
so
high
yet
neither
of
them
had
a
real
grip
on
the
theory
of
international
exchange
but
by
far
the
most
extraordinary
conversation
and
perhaps
the
most
illuminating
i
ever
heard
was
in
a
train
going
to
the
west
country
and
stopping
first
at
swindon
it
passed
between
two
men
who
sat
in
corners
facing
each
other
the
one
was
stout
tall
and
dressed
in
a
tweed
suit
he
had
a
gold
with
a
little
ornament
on
it
representing
a
pair
of
compasses
and
a
square
his
beard
was
brown
and
soft
his
eyes
were
very
sodden
when
he
got
in
he
first
wrapped
a
rug
round
and
round
his
legs
then
he
took
off
his
top
hat
and
put
on
a
cloth
cap
then
he
sat
down
the
other
also
wore
a
tweed
suit
and
was
also
stout
but
he
was
not
so
tall
his
also
was
of
gold
but
of
a
different
pattern
paler
and
with
no
ornament
hung
on
it
his
eyes
also
were
sodden
he
had
no
rug
he
also
took
off
his
hat
but
put
no
cap
upon
his
head
i
noticed
that
he
was
rather
bald
and
in
the
middle
of
his
baldness
was
a
kind
of
little
knob
for
the
purposes
of
this
record
therefore
i
shall
give
him
the
name
bald
while
i
shall
call

was
sitting
next
to

down
to
represent
young
and
here
like

be
lord

suddenly
becoming
very
he

fine
man
he
is
one
of
those
men

you
may
say
that
binder
no
respecter
of
persons
talks
to
me
or

or
any
of
them
just
the
same
bald
yes
they
a
fine
lot
so
charlie
beresford
cap
more
enthusiasm
than
he
had
yet
i
say
ditto
to
that
binder
for
a
few
moments
of
the
characteristics
of
lord
charles
it
pluck
what
it
is
regular
british
pluck
that
the
kind
of
man
no
favouritism
bald
ar
it
a
case
of
well
done
condor
cap
ar
you
right
there
binder
bald
pulling
a
large
flask
out
of
his
pocket
and
speaking
very
well
here
yours
mowle
drinks
out
of
it
a
quantity
of
neat
whisky
and
having
drunk
it
rubs
the
top
of
his
flask
with
his
sleeve
and
hands
it
over
politely
cap
cap
drunk
a
lot
of
neat
whisky
also
rubbed
his
sleeve
over
it
screwed
on
the
little
top
and
giving
that
long
gasp
which
the
occasion
yes
you
right
there
well
done
condor
at
this
point
the
train
began
to
go
slowly
and
just
as
it
stopped
at
the
station
i
heard
cap
begin
again
asking
bald
on
what
occasion
and
for
what
services
lord
charles
beresford
had
been
given
his
title
full
of
the
marvels
of
this
conversation
i
got
out
went
into
the
and
wrote
it
all
down
i
think
i
have
it
accurately
word
for
word
but
there
happened
to
me
what
always
happens
after
all
literary
effort
the
enthusiasm
vanished
the
common
day
was
before
me
i
went
out
to
do
my
work
in
the
place
and
to
meet
quite
ordinary
people
and
to
forget
perhaps
so
strong
is
time
the
fantastic
beings
in
the
train
in
a
word
to
quote
binyon
admirable
lines
the
world
whose
wrong
mocks
holy
beauty
and
our
desire
returned
on
the
return
of
the
dead
the
reason
the
dead
do
not
return
nowadays
is
the
boredom
of
it
in
the
old
time
they
would
come
casually
as
suited
them
without
fuss
and
thinly
as
it
were
which
is
their
nature
but
when
such
visits
were
doubted
even
by
those
who
received
them
and
when
new
and
false
names
were
given
them
the
dead
did
not
find
it
worth
while
it
was
always
a
trouble
they
did
it
really
more
for
our
sakes
than
for
theirs
and
they
would
be
recognised
or
stay
where
they
were
i
am
not
certain
that
they
might
not
have
changed
with
the
times
and
come
frankly
and
positively
as
some
urged
them
to
do
had
it
not
been
for
rabelais
failure
towards
the
end
of
the
boer
war
rabelais
it
will
be
remembered
appeared
in
london
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
season
in
everybody
knows
one
part
of
the
story
or
another
but
if
i
put
down
the
gist
of
it
here
i
shall
be
of
service
for
very
few
people
have
got
it
quite
right
all
through
and
yet
that
story
alone
can
explain
why
one
can
not
get
the
dead
to
come
back
at
all
now
even
in
the
old
doubtful
way
they
did
in
the
and
early
of
the
last
century
there
is
a
place
in
heaven
where
a
group
of
writers
have
put
up
a
colonnade
on
a
little
hill
looking
south
over
the
plains
there
are
thrones
there
with
the
names
of
the
owners
on
them
it
is
a
sort
of
club
rabelais
was
quarrelling
with
some
fool
who
had
missed
fire
with
a
medium
and
was
saying
that
the
modern
world
wanted
positive
unmistakable
appearances
he
said
he
ought
to
know
because
he
had
begun
the
modern
world
lucian
said
it
would
fail
just
as
much
as
any
other
way
rabelais
hotly
said
it
would
he
said
he
would
come
to
london
and
lecture
at
the
london
school
of
economics
and
establish
a
good
solid
objective
relationship
between
the
two
worlds
lucian
said
it
would
end
badly
rabelais
who
had
been
drinking
lost
his
temper
and
did
at
once
what
he
had
only
been
boasting
he
would
do
he
materialised
at
some
expense
and
he
announced
his
lecture
then
the
trouble
began
and
i
am
honestly
of
opinion
that
if
we
had
treated
the
experiment
more
decently
we
should
not
have
this
recent
reluctance
on
the
part
of
the
dead
to
pay
us
reasonable
attention
in
the
first
place
when
it
was
announced
that
rabelais
had
returned
to
life
and
was
about
to
deliver
a
lecture
at
the
london
school
of
economics
whirtle
who
was
a
learned
woman
with
a
reputation
in
the
field
of
objective
psychology
called
it
a
rumour
and
discredited
it
in
a
public
lecture
on
these
three
grounds
that
rabelais
being
dead
so
long
ago
would
not
come
back
to
life
now
that
even
if
he
did
come
back
to
life
it
was
quite
out
of
his
habit
to
give
lectures
that
even
if
he
had
come
back
to
life
and
did
mean
to
lecture
he
would
never
lecture
at
the
london
school
of
economics
which
was
engaged
upon
matters
principally
formulated
since
rabelais
day
and
with
which
moreover
rabelais
essentially
synthetical
mind
would
find
a
difficulty
in
grappling
all
whirtle
audience
agreed
with
one
or
more
of
these
propositions
except
professor
giblet
who
accepted
all
three
saving
and
excepting
the
term
synthetical
as
applied
to
rabelais
mind
for
said
he
you
must
not
be
so
deceived
by
an
early
use
of
the
method
as
to
believe
that
a
man
could
be
in
any
true
sense
synthetical
and
this
judgment
the
professor
emphasized
by
raising
his
voice
suddenly
by
one
octave
his
position
and
that
of
whirtle
were
based
upon
that
thorough
summary
of
rabelais
style
in
effort
book
on
french
literature
each
held
a
sincere
position
nevertheless
this
cold
water
thrown
on
the
very
beginning
of
the
experiment
did
harm
the
attitude
of
the
governing
class
did
harm
also
lady
jane
bird
saw
the
announcement
on
the
placards
of
the
evening
papers
as
she
went
out
to
call
on
a
friend
at
a
man
called
who
was
well
dressed
said
that
he
knew
all
about
rabelais
and
a
group
of
people
began
to
ask
questions
together
lady
jane
herself
did
so
is
or
rather
was
alas
the
second
cousin
of
the
duke
of
durham
he
is
or
rather
was
alas
the
son
of
lord
and
lady
james
verneyson
now
dead
and
he
said
that
rabelais
was
written
by
urquhart
a
long
time
ago
this
was
quite
deplorable
and
did
infinite
harm
he
also
said
that
every
educated
man
had
read
rabelais
and
that
he
had
done
so
he
said
it
was
a
protest
against
rome
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
he
added
that
the
language
was
difficult
to
understand
he
further
remarked
that
it
was
full
of
footnotes
but
that
he
thought
these
had
been
put
in
later
by
scholars
on
this
he
admitted
that
he
did
not
see
what
scholars
could
want
with
rabelais
on
hearing
this
and
the
rest
of
his
information
several
ladies
and
a
young
man
of
genial
expression
began
to
doubt
in
their
turn
a
hack
in
grub
street
whom
painful
labour
had
driven
to
despair
and
mysticism
read
the
announcement
with
curiosity
rather
than
amazement
fully
believing
that
the
great
dead
visiting
as
they
do
the
souls
may
also
come
back
rarely
to
the
material
cities
of
men
one
thing
however
troubled
him
and
that
was
how
rabelais
who
had
slept
so
long
in
peace
beneath
the
fig
tree
of
the
cemetery
of
paul
could
be
risen
now
when
his
grave
was
weighed
upon
by
no
of
the
street
of
the
same
name
howsoever
he
would
have
guessed
that
the
alchemy
of
that
immeasurable
mind
had
in
some
way
got
rid
of
the
difficulty
and
really
the
hack
must
be
forgiven
for
his
faith
since
one
learned
enough
to
know
so
much
about
sites
history
and
literature
is
learned
enough
to
doubt
the
senses
and
to
accept
the
impossible
unfortunately
the
fact
was
vouched
for
in
eight
newspapers
of
which
he
knew
too
much
and
was
not
accepted
in
the
only
sheet
he
trusted
so
he
doubted
too
john
bowles
of
lombard
street
read
the
placards
and
wrought
himself
up
into
a
fury
saying
in
what
other
country
would
these
cursed
boers
be
allowed
to
come
and
lecture
openly
like
this
it
is
enough
to
make
one
excuse
the
people
who
break
up
their
meetings
he
was
a
little
consoled
however
by
the
thought
that
his
country
was
so
magnanimous
and
in
the
calmer
mood
of
went
so
far
as
to
subscribe
to
a
french
newspaper
which
was
being
founded
to
propagate
english
opinions
on
the
continent
he
may
be
neglected
peter
grierson
attorney
was
so
hurried
and
overwrought
with
the
work
he
had
been
engaged
on
that
morning
the
lending
of
to
a
widow
at
per
which
heaven
knows
is
reasonable
on
security
of
a
number
of
shares
in
the
london
and
railway
that
he
misread
the
placard
and
thought
it
ran
rabelais
lecture
at
the
london
school
economics
disturbed
for
a
moment
at
the
thought
of
so
much
paper
wasted
in
time
of
war
for
so
paltry
an
announcement
he
soon
forgot
about
the
whole
business
and
went
off
to
the
holborn
where
he
had
his
lunch
comfortably
standing
up
at
the
buffet
and
then
went
and
worked
at
dominoes
and
cigars
for
two
hours
sir
judson
pennefather
cabinet
minister
and
secretary
of
state
for
public
worship
literature
and
the
fine
arts
but
what
have
i
to
do
with
all
these
absurd
people
upon
whom
the
news
of
rabelais
return
fell
with
such
varied
effect
what
have
you
and
i
to
do
with
men
and
women
who
do
not
can
not
could
not
will
not
ought
not
have
not
did
and
by
all
the
thirsty
demons
that
serve
the
lamps
of
the
cavern
of
the
sibyl
not
count
in
the
scheme
of
things
as
worth
one
little
paring
of
little
finger
nail
what
are
they
that
they
should
interfere
with
the
great
mirific
and
most
assuaging
and
comfortable
feast
of
wit
to
which
i
am
now
about
to
introduce
you
for
know
that
i
take
you
now
into
the
and
put
you
at
the
feet
of
the
of
all
arts
and
divinations
not
to
say
crafts
and
homologisings
and
integrativeness
the
teacher
of
wise
men
the
comfort
of
an
afflicted
world
the
uplifter
of
fools
the
energiser
of
the
lethargic
the
doctor
of
the
gouty
the
guide
of
youth
the
companion
of
middle
age
the
of
the
old
the
pleasant
introducer
of
inevitable
death
yea
the
general
solace
of
mankind
oh
what
are
you
not
now
about
to
hear
if
anywhere
there
are
rivers
in
pleasant
meadows
cool
heights
in
summer
lovely
ladies
discoursing
upon
smooth
lawns
or
music
skilfully
befingered
by
dainty
artists
in
the
shade
of
orange
groves
if
there
is
any
left
of
that
wine
of
chinon
from
behind
the
at
four
francs
a
bottle
and
so
there
is
i
know
for
i
drank
it
at
the
last
reveillon
by
gervais
i
say
if
any
of
these
comforters
of
the
living
anywhere
grace
the
earth
you
shall
find
my
master
rabelais
giving
you
the
very
innermost
and
animating
spirit
of
all
these
good
things
their
utter
flavour
and
their
saving
power
in
the
quintessential
words
of
his
incontestably
regalian
lips
so
here
then
you
may
hear
the
old
wisdom
given
to
our
wretched
generation
for
one
happy
hour
of
just
living
and
we
shall
learn
surely
in
this
case
at
least
that
the
return
of
the
dead
was
admitted
and
the
great
spirits
were
received
and
honoured
but
alas
no
which
is
not
a
still
less
an
anacoluthon
but
a
mere
interjection
contrariwise
in
the
place
of
such
a
sunrise
of
the
mind
what
do
you
think
we
were
given
the
sight
of
an
old
man
in
a
fine
red
gown
and
with
a
university
cap
on
his
head
hurried
along
by
two
policemen
in
the
strand
and
followed
by
a
mob
of
boys
and
ruffians
some
of
whom
took
him
for
kruger
while
others
thought
he
was
but
a
harmless
mummer
and
the
magistrate
who
had
obtained
his
position
by
a
job
said
these
simple
words
i
do
not
know
who
you
are
in
reality
nor
what
foreign
name
mask
under
your
buffoonery
but
i
do
know
on
the
evidence
of
these
intelligent
officers
evidence
upon
which
i
fully
rely
and
which
you
have
made
no
attempt
to
contradict
you
have
disgraced
yourself
and
the
hall
of
your
kind
hosts
and
employers
by
the
use
of
language
which
i
shall
not
characterise
save
by
telling
you
that
it
would
be
comprehensible
only
in
a
citizen
of
the
nation
to
which
you
have
the
misfortune
to
belong
luckily
you
were
not
allowed
to
proceed
for
more
than
a
moment
with
your
vile
harangue
which
if
i
understand
rightly
was
in
praise
of
wine
you
will
go
to
prison
for
twelve
months
i
shall
not
give
you
the
option
of
a
fine
but
i
can
promise
you
that
if
you
prefer
to
serve
with
the
gallant
o
fighting
scouts
your
request
will
be
favourably
entertained
by
the
proper
authorities
long
before
this
little
speech
was
over
rabelais
had
disappeared
and
was
once
more
with
the
immortals
cursing
and
swearing
that
he
would
not
do
it
again
for
sequins
or
thereabouts
no
nor
for
another
thrown
in
as
a
makeweight
there
is
the
whole
story
i
do
not
say
that
rabelais
was
not
both
in
his
appearance
and
his
departure
but
i
do
say
that
if
the
physicists
and
notably
whirtle
had
shown
more
imagination
the
governing
class
a
wider
reading
and
the
magistracy
a
trifle
more
sympathy
with
the
difference
of
tone
between
the
sixteenth
century
and
our
own
time
the
deplorable
misunderstanding
now
separating
the
dead
and
the
living
would
never
have
arisen
for
i
am
convinced
that
the
failure
of
rabelais
attempt
has
been
the
chief
cause
of
it
on
the
approach
of
an
awful
doom
my
dear
little
and
oddities
time
has
come
to
convey
impart
and
make
known
to
you
the
dreadful
conclusions
and
horrible
prognostications
that
flow
happen
deduce
derive
and
are
drawn
from
the
truly
abominable
conditions
of
the
social
medium
in
which
you
and
i
and
all
poor
devils
are
most
fatally
and
surely
bound
to
draw
out
our
miserable
existence
note
i
say
existence
and
not
existences
why
do
i
say
existence
and
not
existences
why
with
a
fine
handsome
plural
ready
to
hand
do
i
wind
you
up
and
turn
you
off
so
to
speak
with
a
piffling
little
singular
not
fit
for
a
newspaper
fellow
let
alone
a
fine
intellectual
and
vegetarian
and
teetotaller
who
writes
in
the
reviews
eh
why
do
i
say
existence
speaking
of
many
several
and
various
persons
as
though
they
had
but
one
mystic
combined
and
corporate
personality
such
as
rousseau
a
fig
for
the
genevese
portrayed
in
his
which
you
have
never
read
and
such
as
hobbes
in
his
which
some
of
you
have
heard
of
ought
to
have
premised
but
did
not
having
the
mind
of
a
lame
halting
and
clockmaker
and
a
blight
on
him
why
now
existence
and
not
existences
you
may
wonder
you
may
ask
yourselves
one
to
another
mutually
round
the
putting
it
as
a
problem
or
riddle
you
may
make
a
game
of
it
or
use
it
for
gambling
or
say
it
suddenly
as
a
catch
for
your
acquaintances
when
they
come
up
from
the
suburbs
it
is
a
very
pretty
question
and
would
have
been
excellently
debated
by
thomas
aquinas
in
the
jacobins
of
jacques
near
the
parloir
aux
bourgeois
by
the
gate
of
the
university
by
albertus
magnus
in
the
cordeliers
hard
by
the
college
of
bourgoyne
by
pic
de
la
mirandole
who
lived
i
care
not
a
rap
where
and
debated
i
know
not
from
adam
how
or
when
by
lord
bacon
who
took
more
bribes
in
a
day
than
you
and
i
could
compass
in
a
dozen
years
by
spinoza
a
good
worker
of
glass
lenses
but
a
philosopher
whom
i
have
never
read
nor
will
by
coleridge
when
he
was
not
talking
about
himself
nor
taking
some
filthy
drug
by
john
pilkington
smith
of
norwood
drysalter
who
has
i
hear
been
lately
horribly
bitten
by
the
metaphysic
and
by
a
crowd
of
others
but
that
all
by
the
way
let
them
debate
that
will
for
it
leads
nowhere
unless
indeed
there
be
sharp
revelation
positive
declaration
and
very
certain
affirmation
to
go
upon
by
way
of
basis
or
first
principle
whence
to
deduce
some
sure
conclusion
and
irrefragable
truth
for
thus
the
intellect
walks
as
it
were
along
a
high
road
whereas
by
all
other
ways
it
is
lurching
and
stumbling
and
boggling
and
tumbling
in
i
know
not
what
mists
and
brambles
of
the
great
bare
murky
twilight
and
marshy
hillside
of
philosophy
where
i
also
wandered
when
i
was
a
fool
and
unoccupied
and
lacking
exercise
for
the
mind
but
from
whence
by
the
grace
of
anthony
of
miranella
and
other
patrons
of
mine
i
have
very
happily
extricated
myself
and
here
i
am
in
the
parlour
of
the
bugle
at
yarmouth
by
a
christian
fire
having
but
lately
come
off
the
sea
and
writing
this
for
the
edification
and
confirmation
of
honest
souls
what
then
of
the
question
de
quuerendo
quantum
qualiter
ubi
cur
quid
quando
quomodo
quum
sive
an
non
ah
there
you
have
it
for
note
you
all
these
interrogative
categories
must
be
met
faced
resolved
and
answered
exactly
or
you
have
no
more
knowledge
of
the
matter
than
the
has
of
economics
or
the
king
of
the
belgians
of
yea
if
you
miss
overlook
neglect
or
shirk
by
reason
of
fatigue
or
indolence
so
much
as
one
tittle
of
these
several
aspects
of
a
question
you
might
as
well
leave
it
altogether
alone
and
give
up
analysis
for
selling
stock
as
did
the
professor
of
verbalism
in
the
university
of
adelaide
to
the
vast
solace
and
enrichment
of
his
family
for
by
the
neglect
of
but
one
of
these
final
and
fundamental
approaches
to
the
full
knowledge
of
a
question
the
world
has
been
irreparably
irretrievably
and
permanently
robbed
of
the
certain
reply
to
and
left
ever
in
the
most
disastrous
doubt
upon
this
most
important
and
necessary
matter
namely
real
existence
can
be
predicated
of
for
anaxagoras
of
syracuse
that
was
tutor
to
the
tyrant
machion
being
in
search
upon
this
question
for
a
matter
of
years
four
months
three
days
and
a
few
odd
hours
and
minutes
did
in
extreme
old
age
as
he
was
walking
by
the
shore
of
the
sea
hit
as
it
were
in
a
flash
upon
six
of
the
seven
answers
and
was
able
in
one
moment
after
so
much
delay
and
vexatious
argument
for
and
against
with
himself
to
resolve
the
problem
upon
the
points
of
why
when
where
how
and
matter
might
or
might
not
be
real
and
was
upon
the
very
nick
of
settling
the
last
little
point
namely
an
that
is
whether
it
real
or
no
when
as
luck
would
have
it
or
rather
as
his
own
beastly
appetite
and
senile
greed
would
have
it
he
broke
off
sharp
at
hearing
the
or
bell
or
horn
or
whatever
it
was
for
upon
these
matters
the
king
was
indifferent
minimis
non
curat
and
so
am
i
and
was
poisoned
even
as
he
sat
at
table
by
the
agents
of
pyrrhus
by
this
accident
by
this
mere
failure
upon
of
the
seven
answers
it
has
been
since
that
day
never
properly
decided
whether
or
no
this
true
existence
was
or
was
not
predicable
of
matter
and
some
believing
matter
to
be
there
have
treated
it
pompously
and
given
it
reverence
and
adored
it
in
a
thousand
merry
ways
but
others
being
confident
it
was
not
there
have
starved
and
fallen
off
edges
and
banged
their
heads
against
corners
and
come
plump
against
high
walls
nor
can
either
party
convince
the
other
nor
can
the
doubts
of
either
be
laid
to
rest
nor
shall
it
from
now
to
the
day
of
doom
be
established
whether
there
is
a
matter
or
is
none
though
many
learned
men
have
given
up
their
lives
to
it
including
professor
britton
who
so
despaired
of
an
issue
that
he
drowned
himself
in
the
cam
only
last
wednesday
but
what
care
i
for
him
or
any
other
don
so
there
we
are
and
an
answer
must
be
found
but
upon
my
soul
i
forget
to
what
it
hangs
though
i
know
well
there
was
some
question
propounded
at
the
beginning
of
this
for
which
i
cared
a
trifle
at
the
time
of
asking
it
and
you
i
hope
not
at
all
let
it
go
the
way
of
all
questions
i
beg
of
you
for
i
am
very
little
inclined
to
seek
and
hunt
through
all
the
heap
that
i
have
been
tearing
through
this
last
hour
with
pegasus
curvetting
and
prancing
and
flapping
his
wings
to
the
danger
of
my
seat
and
of
the
cities
and
fields
below
me
come
come
there
enough
for
one
bout
and
too
much
for
some
no
good
ever
came
of
argument
and
dialectic
for
these
breed
only
angry
gestures
and
gusty
disputes
gustibus
non
and
the
ruin
of
friendships
and
the
very
fruitful
pullulation
of
dictionaries
textbooks
and
wicked
men
not
to
speak
of
intellectuals
newspapers
libraries
bankruptcies
madness
and
ills
innumerable
i
say
live
and
let
live
and
now
i
think
of
it
there
was
something
at
the
beginning
and
title
of
this
that
dealt
with
a
warning
to
ward
you
off
a
danger
of
some
kind
that
terrified
me
not
a
little
when
i
sat
down
to
write
and
that
was
if
i
remember
right
that
a
friend
had
told
me
how
he
had
read
in
a
book
that
the
damnable
brute
capital
was
about
to
swallow
us
all
up
and
make
slaves
of
us
and
that
there
was
no
way
out
of
it
seeing
that
it
was
fixed
settled
and
grounded
in
economics
not
to
speak
of
the
procession
of
the
equinox
the
horoscope
of
trimegistus
and
oh
run
run
the
rich
are
upon
us
help
their
hot
breath
is
on
our
necks
what
jaws
what
jaws
well
what
must
be
must
be
and
what
will
be
will
be
and
if
the
rich
are
upon
us
with
great
open
jaws
and
having
power
to
enslave
all
by
the
very
fatal
process
of
unalterable
laws
and
at
the
bidding
of
blind
fate
as
she
is
expounded
by
her
prophets
who
live
on
milk
and
newspapers
and
do
woundily
talk
jew
socialism
all
day
long
yet
is
it
proved
by
the
same
intellectual
certitude
and
irrefragable
method
that
we
shall
not
be
caught
before
the
year
at
the
earliest
and
with
luck
we
may
run
ten
years
more
why
then
let
us
make
the
best
of
the
time
we
have
and
sail
ride
travel
write
drink
sing
and
all
be
friends
together
and
do
you
go
about
doing
good
to
the
utmost
of
your
power
as
i
heartily
hope
you
will
though
from
your
faces
i
doubt
it
hugely
a
blessing
i
wish
you
all
on
a
rich
man
who
suffered
one
can
not
do
a
greater
service
now
when
a
dangerous
confusion
of
thought
threatens
us
with
an
estrangement
of
classes
than
to
distinguish
in
all
we
write
between
capitalism
the
result
of
a
blind
economic
development
and
the
persons
and
motives
of
those
who
happen
to
possess
the
bulk
of
the
means
of
production
capitalism
may
or
may
not
have
been
a
source
of
evil
to
modern
communities
it
may
have
been
a
necessary
and
even
a
beneficent
phase
in
that
struggle
upward
from
the
brute
which
marks
our
progress
from
gospel
times
until
the
present
day
but
whether
it
has
been
a
good
or
a
bad
phase
in
economic
evolution
it
is
not
scientific
and
it
is
not
english
to
confuse
the
system
with
the
living
human
beings
attached
to
it
and
to
contrast
rich
and
poor
insisting
on
the
supposed
luxury
and
callousness
of
the
one
or
the
humiliations
and
sufferings
of
the
other
to
expose
the
folly
nay
the
wickedness
of
that
attitude
i
have
but
to
take
some
very
real
and
very
human
case
of
a
rich
man
a
very
rich
man
who
suffered
and
suffered
deeply
merely
a
man
one
whose
suffering
wealth
did
not
and
could
not
alleviate
one
very
striking
example
of
this
human
bond
i
am
able
to
lay
before
you
because
the
gentleman
in
question
has
with
fine
human
sympathy
permitted
his
story
to
be
quoted
the
only
stipulation
he
made
with
me
was
first
that
i
should
conceal
real
names
and
secondly
that
i
should
write
the
whole
in
as
journalistic
and
popular
a
method
as
possible
so
that
his
very
legitimate
grievance
in
the
matter
i
am
about
to
describe
should
be
as
widely
known
as
possible
and
also
in
order
to
spread
as
widely
as
possible
the
lesson
it
contains
that
rich
also
are
to
change
all
names
a
purely
mechanical
task
i
easily
achieved
whether
i
have
been
equally
successful
in
my
second
object
of
catching
the
breezy
and
happy
style
of
true
journalism
it
is
for
my
readers
to
judge
i
can
only
assure
them
that
my
intentions
are
pure
i
have
promised
my
friend
to
set
down
the
whole
matter
as
it
occurred
the
press
he
said
to
me
is
the
only
vehicle
left
by
which
one
can
bring
pressure
to
bear
upon
public
opinion
i
hope
you
can
do
something
for
me
you
write
i
believe
he
added
for
the
papers
i
said
i
did
well
he
answered
you
fellows
that
write
for
the
newspapers
have
a
great
advantage
at
this
he
sighed
deeply
and
asked
me
to
come
and
have
lunch
with
him
at
his
club
which
is
called
the
ragamuffins
for
fun
and
is
full
of
jolly
fellows
there
i
ate
boiled
mutton
and
greens
washed
down
with
an
excellent
glass
or
maybe
a
glass
and
a
half
of
belgian
wine
a
wine
called

i
will
not
weary
the

as

however
such
an
introduction
may
prove
overlong
for
the
complaint
i
have
to
publish
i
have
said
enough
to
show
the
position
my
friend
holds
many
of
my
readers
on
reading
this
list
will
guess
at
once
the
true
name
of
the
club
and
may
also
come
near
that
of
my
distinguished
friend
but
i
am
bound
in
honour
to
disguise
it
under
the
veil
of
a
pseudonym
or
de
i
will
call
him
quail
quail
then
was
off
to
shoot
grouse
on
a
moor
he
had
taken
in
mull
for
the
season
the
house
and
estate
are
well
known
to
all
of
us
i
will
disguise
the
moor
under
the
pseudonym
or
de
of
othello
he
was
awaited
at
othello
on
the
evening
of
the
eleventh
for
on
the
one
hand
there
is
an
act
most
strictly
observed
that
not
a
grouse
may
be
shot
until
the
dawn
of
august
and
on
the
other
a
day
passed
at
othello
with
any
other
occupation
but
that
of
shooting
would
be
hell
quail
therefore
proposed
to
travel
to
othello
by
way
of
glasgow
taking
the
at
pancras
on
the
evening
of
the
last
monday
and
engaging
a
bed
on
that
train
it
is
essential
if
a
full
christian
and
sane
view
is
to
be
had
of
this
relation
that
the
reader
should
note
the
following
details
quail
had
the
bed
he
had
sent
his
cheque
for
it
a
week
before
and
held
the
receipt
signed
macgregor
superintendent
true
there
was
a
notice
printed
very
small
on
the
back
of
the
receipt
saying
the
company
would
not
be
responsible
in
any
case
of
disappointment
overcrowding
accident
delay
robbery
murder
or
the
act
of
god
but
my
friend
quail
very
properly
paid
no
attention
to
that
rubbish
knowing
well
enough
he
is
a
that
a
man
can
not
sign
himself
out
of
his
rights
in
order
to
leave
ample
time
for
the
train
my
friend
quail
ordered
dinner
at
eight
a
light
meal
for
his
wife
had
gone
to
the
engadine
some
weeks
before
at
nine
precisely
he
was
in
his
carriage
with
his
coachman
on
the
box
to
drive
his
horses
his
man
mole
also
and
piggy
the
little
dog
in
with
him
he
knows
it
was
nine
because
he
asked
the
butler
what
time
it
was
as
he
left
the
and
the
butler
answered
five
minutes
to
nine
my
lord
moreover
the
clock
in
the
the
one
on
the
stairs
and
his
own
watch
all
corroborated
the
butler
statement
he
arrived
at
pancras
if
as
he
sarcastically
wrote
to
the
company
your
are
to
be
trusted
at
so
far
so
good
he
had
minutes
to
spare
on
his
carriage
driving
up
to
the
station
he
was
annoyed
to
discover
an
enormous
seething
mob
through
which
it
was
impossible
to
penetrate
swirling
round
the
booking
office
and
behaving
with
a
total
lack
of
discipline
which
made
the
confusion
ten
thousand
times
worse
than
it
need
have
been
i
wish
said
quail
to
me
later
with
some
heat
i
wish
i
could
have
put
some
of
those
great
hulking
brutes
into
the
ranks
for
a
few
months
believe
me
conscription
would
work
wonders
quail
himself
holds
a
commission
in
the
yeomanry
and
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
i
only
mention
it
to
show
what
an
effect
this
anarchic
mob
produced
upon
a
man
of
quail
trained
experience
his
man
mole
had
purchased
the
tickets
in
the
course
of
the
day
unfortunately
on
being
asked
for
them
he
confessed
in
some
confusion
to
having
mislaid
them
quail
was
too
well
bred
to
make
a
scene
he
quietly
despatched
his
man
mole
to
the
booking
office
with
orders
to
get
new
tickets
while
he
waited
for
him
at
an
appointed
place
near
the
door
he
had
not
been
there
five
minutes
he
had
barely
seen
his
man
struggle
through
the
press
towards
the
booking
office
when
a
hand
was
laid
upon
his
shoulder
and
a
policeman
told
him
in
an
insolent
and
surly
tone
to
move
out
of
it
quail
remonstrated
and
the
policeman
who
i
am
assured
was
only
a
railway
servant
in
disguise
and
forced
him
from
the
doorway
to
this
piece
of
brutality
quail
ascribes
all
his
subsequent
misfortunes
quail
was
on
the
point
of
giving
his
card
when
he
found
himself
caught
in
an
eddy
of
common
people
who
bore
him
off
his
feet
nor
did
he
regain
them
in
spite
of
his
struggles
until
he
was
tightly
wedged
against
the
wall
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
quail
glanced
at
his
watch
and
found
it
to
be
twenty
minutes
to
ten
there
were
but
seven
minutes
left
before
his
train
would
start
and
his
appointment
with
his
man
mole
was
hopelessly
missed
unless
he
took
the
most
immediate
steps
to
recover
it
quail
is
a
man
of
resource
he
has
served
in
south
africa
and
is
a
director
of
several
companies
he
noticed
that
porters
pushing
heavy
trollies
and
crying
by
your
leave
had
some
chance
of
forging
through
the
brawling
welter
of
people
he
hailed
one
such
and
stretching
as
best
he
could
from
his
wretched
fix
begged
him
to
reach
the
door
and
tell
his
man
mole
where
he
was
at
the
same
time
as
the
occasion
was
most
urgent
for
it
was
now
he
held
out
half
a
sovereign
the
porter
took
it
respectfully
enough
but
to
horror
the
menial
had
no
sooner
grasped
the
coin
than
he
made
off
in
the
opposite
direction
pushing
his
trolley
indolently
before
him
and
crying
by
your
leave
in
a
tone
that
mingled
insolence
with
a
coarse
exultation
quail
now
desperate
fought
and
struggled
to
be
free
there
were
but
two
minutes
left
and
he
so
far
succeeded
as
to
break
through
the
human
barrier
immediately
in
front
of
him
it
may
be
he
used
some
necessary
violence
in
this
attempt
at
any
rate
a
woman
of
the
most
offensive
appearance
raised
piercing
shrieks
and
swore
that
she
was
being
murdered
the
policeman
to
whom
i
have
before
alluded
came
jostling
through
the
throng
seized
quail
by
the
collar
and
crying
what
again
treated
him
in
a
manner
which
in
the
opinion
of
solicitor
would
had
quail
retained
his
number
have
warranted
a
criminal
prosecution
meanwhile
quail
man
mole
was
anxiously
looking
for
him
first
at
the
refreshment
bar
and
later
at
the
train
itself
here
he
was
startled
to
hear
the
guard
say
going
and
before
he
could
reply
he
was
according
to
his
own
statement
thrust
into
the
train
which
immediately
departed
and
did
not
stop
till
peterborough
there
the
faithful
fellow
assures
us
he
alit
returning
home
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
quail
himself
was
released
with
a
torn
coat
and
collar
his
smashed
his
broken
and
smarting
under
a
warning
from
the
policeman
not
to
be
caught
doing
it
again
he
went
home
in
a
cab
to
find
every
single
servant
out
of
the
house
junketing
at
some
or
other
and
several
bottles
of
wine
with
a
dozen
glasses
standing
ready
for
them
against
their
return
on
his
own
study
table
the
unhappy
story
need
not
be
pursued
like
every
misfortune
it
bred
a
crop
of
others
some
so
grievous
that
none
would
expose
them
to
the
public
eye
and
one
consequence
remote
indeed
but
clearly
traceable
to
that
evening
nearly
dissolved
a
union
of
seventeen
years
i
do
not
believe
that
any
one
of
those
who
are
for
ever
presenting
to
us
the
miseries
of
the
lower
classes
would
have
met
a
disaster
of
this
sort
with
the
dignity
and
the
manliness
of
my
friend
and
i
am
further
confident
that
the
recital
of
his
suffering
here
given
will
not
have
been
useless
in
the
great
debate
now
engaged
as
to
the
function
of
wealth
in
our
community
on
a
child
who
died
there
was
once
a
little
whig
ugh
the
oiliness
the
public
theft
the
cowardice
the
welter
of
sin
one
can
not
conceive
the
product
save
under
shelter
and
in
the
midst
of
an
universal
corruption
well
then
there
was
once
a
little
tory
but
stay
that
is
not
a
pleasant
thought
well
then
there
was
once
a
little
boy
whose
name
was
joseph
and
now
i
have
launched
him
i
beg
you
to
follow
most
precisely
all
that
he
said
did
and
was
for
it
contains
a
moral
but
i
would
have
you
bear
me
witness
that
i
have
withdrawn
all
harsh
terms
and
have
called
him
neither
whig
nor
tory
nevertheless
i
will
not
deny
that
had
he
grown
to
maturity
he
would
inevitably
have
been
a
politician
as
you
will
be
delighted
to
find
at
the
end
of
his
short
biography
he
did
not
reach
that
goal
he
never
sat
upon
either
of
the
front
benches
he
never
went
through
the
bitter
business
of
choosing
his
party
and
then
ratting
when
he
found
he
had
made
a
mistake
he
never
so
much
as
got
his
hand
into
the
public
pocket
nevertheless
read
his
story
and
mark
it
well
it
is
of
immense
purport
to
the
state
when
little
joseph
was
born
his
father
who
could
sketch
remarkably
well
and
had
rowed
some
years
before
in
his
college
boat
was
congratulated
very
warmly
by
his
friends
one
lady
wrote
to
him
son
can
not
fail
to
add
distinction
to
an
already
famous
name
for
little
joseph
father
uncle
had
been
an
under
secretary
of
state
then
another
the
family
doctor
said
heartily
well
well
all
doing
excellently
another
duggleton
for
little
joseph
father
family
were
duggletons
and
one
that
will
keep
the
old
flag
flying
little
joseph
father
aunt
whose
husband
had
been
the
under
secretary
wrote
and
said
she
was
longing
to
see
the
and
hinted
that
a
duggleton
the
more
was
sheer
gain
to
this
england
which
our
fathers
made
his
father
put
his
name
down
that
very
day
for
the
club
and
met
there
baron
urscher
who
promised
every
support
if
god
should
spare
him
to
the
time
when
he
might
welcome
another
duggleton
to
these
old
rooms
the
baron
then
recalled
the
names
of
charlie
fox
and
beau
rimmel
that
was
to
say
brummel
he
said
an
abusive
word
or
two
about
gladstone
who
was
then
alive
and
went
away
little
joseph
for
many
long
weeks
continued
to
seem
much
like
others
and
if
he
had
then
died
as
some
cousins
hoped
he
would
and
as
indeed
there
seemed
to
be
a
good
chance
on
the
day
that
he
swallowed
the
pebble
at
bournemouth
i
should
have
no
more
to
write
about
there
would
be
an
end
of
little
joseph
so
far
as
you
and
i
are
concerned
and
as
for
the
family
of
duggleton
why
any
one
but
the
man
who
does
society
notes
in
the
should
write
about
them
i
ca
conceive
well
but
little
joseph
did
not
die
not
just
then
anyhow
he
lived
to
learn
to
speak
and
to
talk
and
to
put
out
his
tongue
at
visitors
let
alone
interrupting
his
parents
with
unpleasing
remarks
and
telling
lies
it
was
early
observed
that
he
did
all
these
things
with
a
and
a
quite
different
from
the
manner
of
his
little
playmates
when
one
day
he
moulded
out
flattened
and
unshaped
the
waxen
nose
of
a
doll
of
his
it
was
apparent
to
all
that
it
had
been
very
skilfully
done
and
showed
a
taste
for
modelling
and
the
admiration
this
excited
was
doubled
when
it
was
discovered
that
he
had
called
the
doll
aunt
garry
he
took
also
to
drawing
things
with
a
pencil
as
early
as
eight
years
old
and
for
this
talent
his
father
house
was
very
suitable
for
duggleton
had
nice
louis
xv
furniture
all
white
and
gold
and
a
quaint
new
medium
on
her
walls
colour
oddly
enough
little
joseph
could
not
pretend
to
but
he
had
a
remarkably
fine
ear
and
was
often
heard
before
he
was
ten
years
old
singing
some
set
of
words
or
other
over
and
over
again
very
loudly
upon
the
staircase
to
a
few
single
notes
it
seems
incredible
but
it
is
certainly
true
that
he
even
composed
at
the
age
of
eleven
wherein
land
and
strand
more
and
shore
would
frequently
recur
the
latter
being
commonly
associated
with
england
to
which
his
beloved
country
the
intelligent
child
would
add
the
epithet
old
he
was
a
short
time
after
this
discovered
playing
upon
words
and
would
pun
upon
rain
and
reign
as
also
upon
wales
the
country
or
rather
province
for
no
patriot
would
admit
a
divided
crown
and
whales
the
vast
oceanic
or
thalassic
mammals
that
swim
in
arctic
waters
he
asked
questions
that
showed
a
surprising
intelligence
and
at
the
same
time
betrayed
a
charming
simplicity
and
purity
of
mind
thus
he
would
upon
their
recent
movements
ladies
who
came
to
call
proving
them
very
frequently
to
have
lied
for
he
was
puzzled
like
most
children
by
the
duplicity
of
the
gay
world
or
again
he
would
ask
guests
at
the
dinner
table
how
old
they
were
and
whether
they
liked
his
father
and
mother
and
this
in
a
loud
and
shrill
way
that
provoked
at
once
the
attention
and
amusement
of
the
select
coterie
for
coterie
it
was
that
gathered
beneath
his
roof
as
is
so
often
the
case
with
highly
strung
natures
he
was
morbidly
sensitive
in
his
upon
one
occasion
he
had
invented
some
boyish
nickname
or
other
for
an
elderly
matron
who
was
present
in
his
mother
and
when
that
lady
most
forcibly
urged
his
parent
to
chastise
him
he
fled
to
his
room
and
wrote
a
short
note
in
pencil
forgiving
his
dear
mamma
her
intimacy
with
his
enemies
and
announcing
his
determination
to
put
an
end
to
his
life
his
mother
on
discovering
this
note
pinned
to
her
chair
gave
way
to
very
natural
alarm
and
rushed
upstairs
to
her
darling
with
whom
she
remonstrated
in
terms
deservedly
severe
pointing
out
the
folly
and
wickedness
of
and
urging
that
such
thoughts
were
unfit
for
one
of
his
tender
years
for
he
was
then
barely
thirteen
this
incident
and
many
others
i
could
quote
made
a
profound
impression
upon
the
honourable
and
duggleton
who
by
the
time
of
their
son
adolescence
were
convinced
that
providence
had
entrusted
them
with
a
vessel
of
no
ordinary
fineness
they
discussed
the
question
of
his
schooling
with
the
utmost
care
and
at
the
age
of
fifteen
sent
little
joseph
as
they
still
affectionately
called
him
to
the
care
of
the
rev
james
filbury
who
kept
a
small
but
exceedingly
expensive
school
upon
the
banks
of
the
river
thames
the
three
years
that
he
spent
at
this
establishment
were
among
the
happiest
in
the
life
of
his
father
private
secretary
and
are
still
remembered
by
many
intimate
friends
of
the
family
he
was
twice
upon
the
point
of
securing
the
prize
for
biblical
studies
and
did
indeed
take
that
for
french
and
arithmetic
filbury
assured
his
father
that
he
had
the
very
highest
hopes
of
his
career
at
the
university
joseph
he
wrote
is
a
fine
highly
tempered
spirit
one
to
whom
continual
application
is
difficult
but
who
is
capable
of
high
flights
of
imagination
not
often
reached
by
our
sturdy
english
boyhood
i
regret
that
i
can
not
see
my
way
to
reducing
the
charge
for
meat
at
breakfast
joseph
health
is
excellent
and
his
scholarship
though
by
no
means
ripe
shows
promise
of
that
and
so
forth
i
have
no
space
to
give
the
letter
in
full
it
betrays
in
every
line
the
effect
this
gifted
youth
had
produced
upon
one
well
acquainted
with
the
marks
of
future
greatness
for
filbury
had
been
the
tutor
and
was
still
the
friend
of
the
duke
of
buxton
the
sometime
of
the
present
bishop
of
lewes
and
the
cousin
of
the
late
joshua
lambkin
of
oxford
little
joseph
entry
into
college
life
abundantly
fulfilled
the
expectations
held
of
him
the
head
of
his
college
wrote
to
his
the
wife
of
the
under
secretary
of
state
he
has
something
in
him
of
what
men
of
old
called
prophecy
and
we
term
genius
old
biddlecup
the
dean
asked
the
boy
to
dinner
and
afterwards
assured
his
father
that
little
joseph
was
the
image
of
william
pitt
whom
he
falsely
pretended
to
have
seen
in
childhood
and
to
whom
the
duggletons
were
related
through
grandmother
whose
sister
had
married
the
first
cousin
of
the
saviour
of
europe
biddlecup
was
an
old
man
and
may
not
have
been
accurate
in
his
historical
pretensions
but
the
main
truth
of
what
he
said
was
certain
for
joseph
resembled
the
great
statesman
at
once
in
his
physical
appearance
for
he
was
sallow
and
had
a
nose
in
his
gifts
in
his
oratory
which
was
ever
remarkable
at
the
social
clubs
and
wines
and
alas
in
his
fondness
for
port
indeed
little
joseph
had
to
pay
the
price
of
concentrating
in
himself
the
genius
of
three
generations
he
suffered
more
than
one
of
the
temptations
that
assault
men
of
vigorous
imagination
he
kept
late
hours
drank
perhaps
not
always
to
excess
but
always
and
gambled
if
not
beyond
his
means
at
least
with
a
feverish
energy
that
was
ruinous
to
his
health
he
fell
desperately
ill
in
the
fortnight
before
his
schools
but
he
was
granted
an
a
degree
equivalent
in
his
case
to
a
first
class
in
honours
and
he
was
asked
by
one
or
other
of
the
colleges
to
compete
for
a
fellowship
it
was
however
given
to
another
candidate
after
this
failure
he
went
home
and
on
his
father
advice
attempted
political
work
but
the
hurry
and
noise
of
an
election
disgusted
him
and
it
is
feared
that
his
cynical
and
highly
epigrammatic
speeches
were
another
cause
of
his
defeat
sir
william
mackle
who
had
watched
the
boy
with
the
tenderest
interest
and
listened
to
his
fancied
experiences
with
a
patience
ordered
complete
rest
and
change
and
recommended
the
south
of
france
he
was
sent
thither
with
a
worthless
friend
or
rather
dependent
who
permitted
the
lad
to
gamble
and
even
to
borrow
money
and
it
was
this
friend
to
whom
sir
william
in
his
letter
to
the
honourable
duggleton
acknowledging
receipt
of
his
cheque
attributed
the
tragedy
that
followed
had
he
not
wrote
the
distinguished
physician
permitted
our
poor
joseph
to
borrow
money
of
him
had
he
resolutely
refused
to
drink
wine
at
dinner
had
he
locked
joseph
up
in
his
room
every
evening
at
the
opening
hour
of
the
casino
we
should
not
have
to
deplore
the
loss
of
one
of
england
noblest
nor
did
the
false
friend
make
things
easier
for
the
bereaved
father
by
suggesting
ere
twelve
short
months
had
elapsed
that
the
sums
joseph
had
borrowed
of
him
should
be
repaid
joseph
one
fatal
night
somewhat
heated
by
wine
had
heard
a
frenchman
say
to
an
italian
at
his
elbow
certain
very
outrageous
things
about
one
mazzini
the
pair
were
discussing
a
local
bookmaker
but
the
boy
whose
passion
for
italian
unity
is
now
well
known
imagined
that
the
philosopher
and
statesman
was
in
question
he
fell
into
such
a
passion
and
attacked
these
offensive
foreigners
with
such
violence
as
to
bring
on
an
attack
from
which
he
did
not
recover
his
grave
now
whitens
the
hillside
of
the
monte
resorto
in
french
he
left
some
fifty
short
poems
in
the
manner
of
shelley
rossetti
and
swinburne
and
a
few
in
an
individual
style
that
would
surely
have
developed
with
age
these
have
since
been
gathered
into
a
volume
and
go
far
to
prove
the
truth
of
his
father
despairing
cry
joseph
the
poor
man
sobbed
as
he
knelt
by
the
insanitary
curtained
bed
on
which
the
body
lay
joseph
would
have
done
for
the
name
of
duggleton
in
literature
what
my
uncle
did
for
it
in
politics

be

if
this
page
does
not
appal
you
nothing
will
if
these
first
words
do
not
fill
you
with
an
uneasy
presentiment
of
doom
indeed
indeed
you
have
been
hitherto
blessed
in
an
ignorance
of
woe
it
is
lost
what
is
lost
the
revelation
this
page
was
to
afford
the
essay
which
was
to
have
stood
here
upon
page
of
my
book
the
noblest
of
them
all
the
words
you
so
eagerly
expected
the
full
exposition
which
was
to
have
brought
you
such
relief
is
not
here
it
was
lost
just
after
i
wrote
it
it
can
never
be
it
is
gone
much
depended
upon
it
it
would
have
led
you
to
a
great
and
to
a
rapidly
acquired
fortune
but
you
must
not
ask
for
it
you
must
turn
your
mind
away
it
can
not
be
and
all
that
can
take
its
place
is
a
sort
of
dirge
for
departed
and
irrecoverable
things
lugete
o
veneres
cupidinesque
which
signifies
mourn
oh
you
pleasant
people
you
spirits
that
attend
the
happiness
of
mankind
et
quantum
est
hominum
venustiorum
which
signifies
and
you
such
mortals
as
are
chiefly
attached
to
delightful
things
which
signifies
my
little
careful
tidy
bit
of
writing
is
lost
i
lost
it
in
a
cab
it
was
a
noble
and
accomplished
thing
pliny
would
have
loved
it
who
said
ea
est
stomachi
mei
natura
ut
nil
nisi
merum
atque
totum
velit
which
signifies
such
is
the
character
of
my
taste
that
it
will
tolerate
nothing
but
what
is
absolute
and
full
it
is
no
use
grumbling
about
the
latin
the
nature
of
great
disasters
calls
out
for
that
foundational
tongue
they
roll
as
it
were
do
the
great
disasters
of
our
time
right
down
the
emptiness
of
the
centuries
until
they
strike
the
walls
of
rome
and
provoke
these
sonorous
echoes
worthy
of
mighty
things
it
was
to
have
stood
here
instead
of
this
its
poor
apologist
it
was
to
have
filled
these
lines
this
space
this
very
page
it
is
not
here
you
all
know
how
coming
eagerly
to
a
house
to
see
someone
dearly
loved
you
find
in
their
place
on
entering
a
sister
or
a
friend
who
makes
excuses
for
them
you
all
know
how
the
mind
grows
blank
at
the
news
and
all
nature
around
one
shrivels
it
is
a
worse
emptiness
than
to
be
alone
so
it
is
with
me
when
i
consider
this
as
i
write
it
and
then
think
of
that
other
which
should
have
taken
its
place
for
what
i
am
writing
now
is
like
a
little
wizened
figure
dressed
in
mourning
and
weeping
before
a
deserted
shrine
but
that
other
which
i
have
lost
would
have
been
like
an
emperor
returned
from
a
triumph
and
seated
upon
a
throne
indeed
indeed
it
was
admirable
if
you
ask
me
where
i
wrote
it
it
was
in
constantine
upon
the
rock
of
cirta
where
the
storms
come
bowling
at
you
from
mount
atlas
and
where
you
feel
yourself
part
of
the
sky
at
least
it
was
there
in
cirta
that
i
blocked
out
the
thing
for
efforts
of
that
magnitude
are
not
completed
in
one
place
or
day
it
was
in
cirta
that
i
carved
it
into
form
and
gave
it
a
general
life
upon
the
of
january
sitting
where
long
ago
massinissa
had
come
riding
in
through
the
only
gate
of
the
city
sitting
his
horse
without
stirrups
or
bridle
beside
me
as
i
wrote
an
arab
looked
carefully
at
every
word
and
shook
his
head
because
he
could
not
understand
the
language
but
the
muses
understood
and
apollo
which
were
its
authors
almost
as
much
as
i
how
graceful
it
was
and
yet
how
firm
how
generous
and
yet
how
particular
how
easy
how
superb
and
yet
how
stuffed
with
dignity
there
ran
through
it
and
essential
a
sort
of
broken
rhythm
that
never
descended
to
rhetoric
but
seemed
to
enliven
and
lift
up
the
order
of
the
words
until
they
were
filled
with
something
approaching
music
and
with
all
this
the
meaning
was
fixed
and
new
the
order
lucid
the
adjectives
choice
the
verbs
strong
the
substantives
meaty
and
full
of
sap
it
combined
if
i
may
say
so
with
modesty
all
that
milton
desired
to
achieve
with
all
that
bacon
did
in
the
modelling
of
english
and
it
is
gone
it
will
never
be
seen
or
read
or
known
at
all
it
has
utterly
disappeared
nor
is
it
even
preserved
in
any
human
memory
no
not
in
my
own
i
kept
it
for
a
year
closely
filing
polishing
and
emending
it
until
one
would
have
thought
it
final
and
even
then
i
continued
to
develop
and
to
mould
it
it
grew
like
a
young
tree
in
the
corner
of
a
fruitful
field
and
gave
an
enduring
pleasure
it
never
left
me
by
night
or
by
day
it
crossed
the
pyrenees
with
me
seven
times
and
the
mediterranean
twice
it
rode
horses
with
me
and
was
become
a
part
of
my
habit
everywhere
in
trying
to
ford
the
sousseyou
i
held
it
high
out
of
the
water
saving
it
alone
and
once
by
a
camp
fire
i
woke
and
read
it
in
the
mountains
before
dawn
my
companions
slept
on
either
side
of
me
the
great
brands
of
pine
glowed
and
gave
me
light
there
was
a
complete
silence
in
the
forest
except
for
the
noise
of
water
and
in
the
midst
of
such
spells
i
was
so
entranced
by
the
beauty
of
the
thing
that
when
i
had
done
my
reading
i
took
a
dead
coal
from
the
fire
and
wrote
at
the
foot
of
the
paper
there
is
not
a
word
which
the
most
exuberant
could
presume
to
add
nor
one
which
the
most
fastidious
would
dare
to
erase
all
that
glory
has
vanished
i
know
very
well
what
the
cabman
did
he
looked
through
the
in
the
top
of
the
roof
to
see
if
i
had
left
anything
behind
it
was
in
vigo
street
at
the
corner
that
the
fate
struck
he
looked
and
saw
a
sheet
or
two
of
paper
something
of
no
value
he
crumpled
it
up
and
threw
it
away
and
it
joined
the
company
which
men
have
not
been
thought
worthy
to
know
it
went
to
join
calvus
and
the
dreadful
books
of
the
sibyl
and
those
charred
leaves
which
were
found
on
the
floor
where
chatterton
lay
dead
i
went
three
times
to
scotland
yard
allowing
long
intervals
and
torturing
myself
with
hope
three
times
my
hands
thought
to
hold
it
and
three
times
they
closed
on
nothingness
a
policeman
then
told
me
that
cabmen
very
rarely
brought
him
written
things
but
rather
sticks
gloves
rings
purses
parcels
umbrellas
and
the
crushed
hats
of
drunken
men
not
often
verse
or
prose
and
i
abandoned
my
quest
there
are
some
reading
this
who
may
think
me
a
trifle
too
fond
and
may
doubt
the
great
glory
to
which
i
testify
here
they
will
remember
how
singularly
the
things
we
no
longer
possess
rise
upon
the
imagination
and
enlarge
themselves
and
they
will
quote
that
pathetic
error
whereby
the
dead
become
much
dearer
to
us
when
we
can
no
longer
smile
into
their
faces
or
do
them
the
good
we
desire
they
will
suggest
most
tenderly
that
loss
and
the
enchantment
of
memory
have
lent
a
thought
too
much
of
radiance
and
of
harmony
to
what
was
certainly
a
noble
creation
of
the
mind
but
still
human
and
shot
with
error
to
such
a
criticism
i
can
not
reply
i
have
no
longer
alas
the
best
of
replies
the
thing
itself
the
achievement
and
not
having
that
i
have
nothing
i
am
without
weapons
who
shall
convince
of
personality
of
beauty
or
of
holiness
unless
they
be
seen
and
felt
so
it
is
with
letters
and
if
i
am
not
believed
or
even
if
i
am
it
is
of
little
moment
for
the
beloved
object
is
rapt
away
its
matter
if
one
can
say
that
anything
so
manifold
and
exalted
had
a
mere
subject
its
matter
was
the
effect
of
the
piercing
of
the
suez
canal
upon
coastwise
trade
in
the
mediterranean
but
it
is
profane
to
bring
before
the
general
gaze
a
title
which
can
tell
the
world
nothing
of
the
iridescence
and
vitality
it
has
lost
i
will
not
console
myself
with
the
uncertain
guess
that
things
perished
are
in
some
way
recoverable
beyond
the
stars
nor
hope
to
see
and
read
again
the
artistry
and
the
result
whose
loss
i
have
mourned
in
these
lines
but
if
as
the
wisest
men
imagine
there
is
a
place
of
repose
for
whatever
most
deserves
it
among
the
shades
there
either
i
or
others
worthier
may
read
what
will
never
be
read
by
living
eyes
or
praised
by
living
lips
again
it
may
be
so
but
the
loss
alone
is
certain
on
a
man
who
was
protected
by
another
man
there
was
once
a
man
called
mahmoud
he
had
other
names
such
as
ali
akbar
and
shmaeil
and
so
forth
with
which
i
will
not
trouble
you
because
in
very
short
stories
it
is
important
not
to
confuse
the
mind
i
have
been
assured
of
this
by
many
authorities
some
of
whom
make
a
great
deal
of
money
by
short
stories
and
all
of
whom
know
a
great
deal
about
the
way
in
which
they
ought
to
be
written
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
very
much
doubt
whether
this
is
a
short
story
at
all
for
it
has
no
plot
so
far
and
i
do
not
see
any
plot
developing
no
matter
the
thing
is
to
say
what
one
has
to
say
humbly
but
fully
providence
will
look
after
the
rest
so
as
i
was
saying
there
was
a
man
called
mahmoud
he
lived
in
a
country
entirely
made
of
sand
there
were
hills
which
on
the
maps
were
called
mountains
but
when
you
came
to
look
at
them
they
were
only
a
lot
more
sand
and
there
was
nothing
about
them
except
an
aspect
of
sand
heaped
up
you
may
say
how
then
did
mahmoud
build
a
house
he
did
not
he
lived
in
a
tent
but
you
continue
what
did
he
do
about
drinking
well
it
was
mahmoud
habit
to
go
to
a
place
where
he
knew
that
by
scratching
a
little
he
would
find
bad
water
and
there
he
would
scratch
a
little
and
find
it
and
being
an
abstemious
man
he
needed
but
a
drop
the
sun
in
mahmoud
country
was
extremely
hot
it
stood
right
up
above
one
head
and
looked
like
the
little
thing
that
you
get
in
the
focus
of
a
burning
glass
the
sun
made
it
almost
impossible
to
move
except
in
the
early
morning
or
at
evening
and
even
during
the
night
it
was
not
particularly
cool
it
never
rained
in
this
place
there
were
no
rivers
and
no
trees
there
was
no
grass
and
the
only
animal
was
a
camel
the
camel
was
content
to
eat
a
kind
of
scrub
that
grew
here
and
there
on
the
sand
and
it
drank
the
little
water
mahmoud
could
afford
it
and
was
permanently
happy
so
was
mahmoud
beneath
him
the
sand
sloped
down
until
it
met
the
sea
which
was
tepid
on
account
of
the
great
heat
and
in
which
were
a
lot
of
fish
pearls
and
other
things
every
now
and
then
mahmoud
would
force
a
son
or
domestic
of
his
to
go
down
and
hoick
out
a
pearl
and
this
pearl
he
would
exchange
for
something
that
he
absolutely
needed
such
as
a
new
tent
or
a
new
camel
and
then
he
went
on
living
the
way
he
had
been
living
before
now
one
day
there
came
to
this
part
of
the
world
a
man
called
smith
he
was
dressed
as
you
and
i
are
in
trousers
and
a
coat
and
boots
and
he
had
a
billycock
hat
on
he
had
a
foolish
anxious
face
he
did
not
keep
his
word
particularly
and
he
was
exceedingly
fond
of
money
he
had
spent
most
of
his
life
accumulating
all
sorts
of
wealth
in
a
great
bag
and
he
landed
with
this
bag
in
country
and
mahmoud
was
as
polite
to
him
as
the
heat
would
allow
then
mahmoud
said
to
him
you
appear
to
be
a
very
rich
man
and
smith
said
i
am
and
opened
his
bag
and
showed
a
great
quantity
of
things
so
mahmoud
was
pleased
and
astonished
and
fussed
a
good
deal
considering
the
climate
and
got
quite
a
quantity
of
pearls
out
of
the
sea
and
gave
them
to
smith
who
let
him
have
a
gun
but
a
bad
one
and
he
smith
retained
a
good
rifle
then
smith
sat
down
and
waited
for
about
six
months
living
on
the
provisions
he
had
brought
in
his
bag
until
mahmoud
said
to
him
what
have
you
come
to
do
here
and
smith
said
why
to
tell
you
the
honest
truth
i
have
come
to
protect
you
so
mahmoud
thought
a
long
time
smoking
a
pipe
because
he
did
not
understand
a
word
of
what
smith
had
said
then
mahmoud
said
all
right
protect
away
and
after
that
there
was
a
silence
for
about
another
six
months
and
nothing
had
happened
mahmoud
did
not
mind
being
protected
because
it
made
no
difference
to
him
and
after
a
certain
time
he
had
got
all
he
wanted
out
of
smith
and
was
tired
of
bothering
about
the
pearls
so
he
and
smith
just
lived
side
by
side
doing
nothing
in
particular
except
that
smith
went
on
protecting
and
that
mahmoud
went
on
being
protected
but
while
mahmoud
was
perfectly
content
to
be
protected
till
doomsday
being
an
kind
of
fellow
smith
was
more
and
more
put
out
he
was
a
trifle
irritable
by
nature
the
climate
did
not
suit
him
he
drank
beer
and
whisky
and
other
things
quite
dangerous
under
such
a
sun
and
he
came
out
all
over
like
the
measles
he
tried
to
pass
the
time
riding
on
a
camel
at
first
he
thought
it
great
sport
but
after
a
little
he
got
tired
of
that
also
he
began
to
write
poetry
all
about
mahmoud
and
as
mahmoud
could
not
read
it
did
not
much
matter
then
he
wrote
poetry
about
himself
making
out
mahmoud
to
be
excessively
fond
of
him
and
this
poetry
he
read
to
himself
and
it
calmed
him
but
as
mahmoud
did
not
know
about
this
poetry
smith
got
bored
with
it
and
his
irritation
increasing
he
wrote
more
poetry
showing
mahmoud
to
be
a
villain
and
a
serf
and
showing
himself
smith
to
be
under
a
divine
mission
now
just
when
things
had
come
to
this
unpleasant
state
mahmoud
got
up
and
shook
himself
and
began
skipping
and
dancing
outside
the
door
of
his
tent
and
running
round
and
round
it
very
fast
and
waving
his
hands
in
the
air
and
shouting
incongruous
things
smith
was
exceedingly
annoyed
by
this
he
had
never
gone
on
like
that
himself
and
he
did
not
see
why
mahmoud
should
but
mahmoud
had
lived
there
a
good
deal
longer
than
smith
had
and
he
knew
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
there
were
stories
of
people
in
the
past
who
had
felt
inclined
to
go
on
like
this
and
had
restrained
themselves
with
terrible
consequences
so
mahmoud
went
on
worse
than
ever
running
as
fast
as
he
could
out
into
the
sand
shouting
leaping
into
the
air
and
then
running
back
again
as
fast
as
he
could
and
firing
off
his
gun
and
calling
upon
his
god
smith
whose
nerves
were
at
the
last
stretch
asked
mahmoud
savagely
what
he
was
about
to
this
mahmoud
gave
no
reply
save
to
twirl
round
rapidly
upon
one
foot
and
to
fall
down
foaming
at
the
mouth
smith
therefore
losing
all
patience
said
to
mahmoud
if
you
do
not
stop
i
will
shoot
you
by
way
of
protecting
you
against
yourself
mahmoud
did
not
know
what
the
word
protected
meant
but
he
understood
the
word
shoot
and
shouting
with
joy
he
blew
off
smith
hat
with
his
gun
and
said
a
fight
a
fight
for
he
loved
fighting
when
he
was
in
this
mood
while
smith
detested
it
smith
however
remembered
that
he
had
come
there
to
protect
mahmoud
he
set
his
teeth
aimed
with
his
rifle
fired
at
mahmoud
and
missed
mahmoud
was
so
surprised
at
this
that
he
ran
at
smith
and
rolled
him
over
and
over
on
the
ground
then
they
unclenched
both
very
much
out
of
breath
and
smith
said
will
you
or
will
you
not
be
protected
mahmoud
said
he
should
be
delighted
moreover
he
said
that
he
had
given
his
word
that
he
would
be
protected
and
that
he
was
not
a
man
to
break
his
word
after
that
he
took
smith
by
the
hand
and
shook
it
up
and
down
for
about
five
minutes
until
smith
was
grievously
put
out
when
they
were
friends
again
smith
said
to
mahmoud
will
you
not
go
down
into
the
sea
and
get
me
some
more
pearls
no
said
mahmoud
i
am
always
very
exhausted
after
these
attacks
then
smith
sat
down
by
the
seashore
and
began
to
cry
thinking
of
his
home
and
of
the
green
trees
and
of
the
north
and
he
wrote
another
poem
about
the
burden
that
he
had
borne
and
of
what
a
great
man
he
was
and
how
he
went
all
over
the
world
protecting
people
and
how
brave
he
was
and
how
mahmoud
also
was
very
brave
but
how
he
was
much
braver
than
mahmoud
then
he
said
mahmoud
i
am
going
away
back
to
my
distant
home
unless
you
will
get
me
more
pearls
but
mahmoud
said
i
can
not
get
you
any
more
pearls
because
it
is
too
hot
and
if
only
you
will
stop
you
can
go
on
doing
some
protecting
which
upon
my
soul
i
do
like
better
than
anything
in
the
world
and
even
as
he
said
this
he
began
jumping
about
and
shouting
strange
things
and
waving
his
gun
and
smith
at
once
went
away
then
mahmoud
sat
down
sadly
by
the
sea
and
thought
of
how
smith
had
protected
him
and
how
now
all
that
was
passed
and
the
old
monotonous
life
would
begin
again
but
smith
went
home
and
all
his
neighbours
asked
how
it
was
that
he
protected
so
well
and
he
wrote
a
book
to
enlighten
them
called
i
protected
then
all
his
neighbours
read
this
book
and
went
out
in
a
great
boat
to
do
something
of
the
same
kind
and
smith
could
not
refrain
from
smiling
mahmoud
however
by
his
lonely
shore
regretted
more
and
more
this
episode
in
his
dull
life
and
he
wept
when
he
remembered
the
fantastic
smith
who
had
such
an
enormous
number
of
things
in
his
bag
and
who
had
protected
him
and
he
also
wrote
a
poem
which
is
rather
difficult
to
understand
in
connection
with
the
business
but
which
to
him
exactly
described
it
and
the
poem
went
like
this
having
no
metre
and
no
rhyming
and
being
sung
to
three
notes
and
a
quarter
in
a
kind
of
wail
when
the
jackal
and
the
lion
meet
it
is
full
moon
it
is
full
moon
and
the
gazelles
are
abroad
why
are
the
gazelles
abroad
when
the
jackal
and
the
lion
meet
when
it
is
full
moon
in
the
desert
and
there
is
no
wind
there
is
no
wind
because
the
gazelles
are
abroad
the
moon
is
at
the
full
and
the
lion
and
the
jackal
are
together
where
is
he
that
protected
me
and
where
is
the
great
battle
and
the
shouts
and
the
feasting
afterwards
and
where
is
that
bag
but
we
dwell
in
the
desert
always
and
men
do
not
visit
us
and
the
lion
and
the
jackal
have
met
and
it
is
full
moon
o
gazelles
mahmoud
was
so
pleased
with
this
song
that
he
wrote
it
down
a
thing
he
only
did
with
one
song
out
of
several
thousands
for
he
wrote
with
difficulty
but
i
think
it
a
most
ridiculous
song
and
i
far
prefer
smith
though
you
would
never
know
it
had
to
do
with
the
same
business
on
national
debts
which
are
imaginaries
and
true
nothings
of
state
one
day
peter
and
paul
i
knew
them
both
the
dear
fellows
peter
perhaps
a
trifle
wild
paul
a
little
priggish
but
that
is
no
matter
one
day
i
say
peter
and
paul
who
lived
together
in
rooms
off
southampton
row
bloomsbury
a
very
delightful
spot
were
talking
over
their
mutual
affairs
my
dear
paul
said
peter
i
wish
i
could
persuade
you
to
this
expenditure
it
will
be
to
our
mutual
advantage
come
now
you
have
ten
thousand
a
year
of
your
own
and
i
with
great
difficulty
earn
a
hundred
it
is
surprising
that
you
should
make
the
fuss
you
do
besides
which
you
well
know
that
this
feeding
off
is
irksome
we
really
need
a
table
and
it
will
but
cost
ten
pounds
to
all
this
paul
listened
doubtfully
pursing
up
his
lips
joining
the
tips
of
his
fingers
crossing
his
legs
and
playing
the
solemn
fool
generally
peter
said
he
i
mislike
this
scheme
of
yours
it
is
a
heavy
outlay
for
a
single
moment
it
would
disturb
our
credit
and
yours
especially
for
your
share
would
come
to
five
pounds
and
you
would
have
to
put
off
paying
the
agency
to
which
you
foolishly
subscribe
no
there
is
an
infinitely
better
way
than
this
crude
idea
of
paying
cash
down
in
common
i
will
lend
the
whole
sum
of
ten
pounds
to
our
common
stock
and
we
will
each
pay
one
pound
a
year
as
interest
to
myself
for
the
loan
i
for
my
part
will
not
shirk
my
duty
in
the
matter
of
this
interest
and
i
sincerely
trust
you
will
not
shirk
yours
peter
was
so
delighted
with
this
arrangement
that
his
gratitude
knew
no
bounds
he
would
frequently
compliment
himself
in
private
on
the
advantage
of
living
with
paul
and
when
he
went
out
to
see
his
friends
it
was
with
the
jovial
air
of
the
man
with
the
bottomless
purse
for
he
did
not
feel
the
pound
a
year
he
had
to
pay
and
paul
always
seemed
willing
to
undertake
similar
expenses
on
similar
terms
he
purchased
a
bronze
he
fitted
the
rooms
with
electric
light
he
bought
for
the
common
use
a
large
prize
dog
for
and
he
was
for
ever
bringing
in
made
dishes
bottles
of
wine
and
what
not
all
paid
for
by
this
lending
of
his
the
interest
increased
to
and
then
to
a
year
but
paul
was
so
rigorously
honest
prompt
and
exact
in
paying
himself
the
interest
that
peter
could
not
bear
to
be
behindhand
or
to
seem
less
punctual
and
upright
than
his
friend
but
so
high
a
proportion
of
his
small
income
going
in
interest
left
poor
peter
but
a
meagre
margin
for
himself
and
he
had
to
dine
at
lockhart
and
get
his
clothes
ready
made
which
to
a
refined
and
sensitive
soul
such
as
his
was
a
grievous
trial
some
little
time
after
a
fishmonger
who
had
attained
to
cabinet
rank
was
married
to
the
daughter
of
a
levantine
and
london
was
in
consequence
illuminated
paul
said
to
peter
in
his
jovial
way
it
is
imperative
that
we
should
show
no
meanness
upon
this
occasion
we
are
known
for
the
most
flourishing
and
pair
of
bachelors
in
the
neighbourhood
and
i
have
not
hesitated
for
i
know
i
had
your
consent
beforehand
to
go
to
brock
and
order
an
immense
quantity
of
fireworks
for
the
balcony
on
this
auspicious
occasion
not
a
word
the
loan
is
mine
and
very
freely
do
i
make
it
to
our
mutual
position
so
that
night
there
was
an
illumination
at
their
flat
and
the
was
a
vast
combination
of
roses
thistles
shamrocks
leeks
kangaroos
beavers
schamboks
and
other
national
emblems
and
beneath
it
the
motto
united
we
stand
divided
we
fall
peter
and
paul
in
flaming
letters
two
feet
high
peter
was
after
this
permanently
reduced
to
living
upon
rice
and
to
mending
his
own
clothes
but
he
could
easily
see
how
fair
the
arrangement
was
and
he
was
not
the
man
to
grumble
at
a
free
contract
moreover
he
was
expecting
a
rise
in
salary
from
the
editor
of
the
in
which
paper
he
wrote
woman
world
and
signed
it
emily
at
the
close
of
the
year
peter
had
some
difficulty
in
meeting
the
interest
though
paul
had
with
true
business
probity
paid
his
on
the
very
day
it
fell
due
peter
therefore
approached
paul
with
some
little
diffidence
and
hesitation
saying
paul
i
trust
you
will
excuse
me
but
i
beg
you
will
be
so
very
good
as
to
see
your
way
if
possible
to
granting
me
an
extension
of
time
in
the
matter
of
paying
my
interest
paul
who
was
above
everything
regular
and
methodical
replied
hum
chrm
chrum
chrm
well
my
dear
peter
it
would
not
be
generous
to
press
you
but
i
trust
you
will
remember
that
this
money
has
not
been
spent
upon
my
private
enjoyment
it
has
gone
for
the
glory
of
our
mutual
position
pray
do
not
forget
that
peter
and
remember
also
that
if
you
have
to
pay
interest
so
have
i
so
have
i
we
are
all
in
the
same
boat
peter
sink
or
swim
sink
or
swim
then
his
face
brightened
he
patted
peter
genially
on
the
shoulder
and
added
do
not
think
me
harsh
peter
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
keep
to
a
strict
way
of
doing
things
for
i
have
a
large
property
to
manage
but
you
may
be
sure
that
my
friendship
for
you
is
of
more
value
to
me
than
a
few
paltry
sovereigns
i
will
lend
you
the
sum
you
owe
to
the
interest
on
the
common
debt
and
though
in
strict
right
you
alone
should
pay
the
interest
on
this
new
loan
i
will
call
half
of
it
my
own
and
you
shall
pay
but
a
year
on
it
for
ever
peter
eyes
swam
with
tears
at
paul
generosity
and
he
thanked
his
stars
that
his
lot
had
been
cast
with
such
a
man
but
when
paul
came
again
with
a
grave
face
and
said
to
him
peter
my
boy
we
must
insure
at
once
against
burglars
the
underwriters
demand
a
hundred
pounds
his
heart
broke
and
he
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
further
payments
paul
however
with
the
quiet
good
sense
that
characterised
him
pointed
out
the
necessity
of
the
payment
and
eyeing
peter
with
compassion
for
a
moment
told
him
that
he
had
long
been
feeling
that
he
peter
had
been
unfairly
taxed
it
is
a
principle
said
paul
that
taxation
should
fall
upon
men
in
proportion
to
their
ability
to
pay
it
i
am
determined
that
whatever
happens
you
shall
in
future
pay
but
a
third
of
the
interest
that
may
accrue
upon
further
loans
it
was
in
vain
that
peter
pointed
out
that
in
his
case
even
a
thirtieth
would
mean
starvation
paul
was
firm
and
carried
his
point
the
wretched
peter
was
now
but
skin
and
bone
and
his
earning
power
small
as
it
had
ever
been
was
considerably
lessened
paul
began
to
fear
very
seriously
for
his
invested
funds
he
therefore
kept
up
peter
spirits
as
best
he
could
with
such
advice
as
the
following
dear
peter
do
not
repine
your
lot
is
indeed
hard
but
it
has
its
silver
lining
you
are
the
member
of
a
partnership
famous
among
all
other
for
its
display
of
fireworks
and
its
fine
furniture
so
valuable
is
the
room
in
which
you
live
that
the
insurance
alone
is
the
wonder
and
envy
of
our
neighbours
consider
also
how
firm
and
stable
these
loans
make
our
comradeship
they
give
me
a
stake
in
the
rooms
and
furnish
a
ready
market
for
the
spare
capital
of
our
little
community
the
interest
we
pay
upon
the
fund
is
an
evidence
of
our
social
rank
and
all
london
stares
with
astonishment
at
the
flat
of
peter
and
paul
which
can
without
an
effort
buy
such
gorgeous
furniture
at
a
moment
notice
but
alas
these
words
were
of
no
avail
on
a
beautiful
spring
day
when
all
the
world
seemed
to
be
holding
him
to
the
joys
of
living
peter
passed
quietly
away
in
his
little
truckle
bed
unattended
even
by
a
doctor
whose
fees
would
have
necessitated
a
loan
the
interest
of
which
he
could
never
have
paid
paul
on
the
death
of
peter
gave
way
at
first
to
bitter
recrimination
is
this
the
way
he
said
that
you
repay
years
of
unstinted
generosity
nay
is
this
the
way
you
meet
your
sacred
obligations
you
promised
upon
a
thousand
occasions
to
pay
your
share
of
the
interest
for
ever
and
now
like
a
defaulter
you
abandon
your
post
and
destroy
half
the
revenue
of
our
firm
by
one
intempestive
and
thoughtless
act
had
you
but
possessed
a
little
property
which
properly
secured
would
continue
to
meet
the
claims
you
had
incurred
i
had
not
blamed
you
but
a
man
who
earns
all
that
he
possesses
has
no
right
to
pledge
himself
to
perpetual
payment
unless
he
is
prepared
to
live
for
ever
nobler
thoughts
however
succeeded
this
outburst
and
paul
threw
himself
upon
the
bed
of
his
departed
friend
and
moaned
who
now
will
pay
me
an
income
in
return
for
my
investments
all
my
fortune
is
sunk
in
this
flat
though
i
myself
pay
the
interest
never
so
regularly
it
will
not
increase
my
fortune
by
one
farthing
i
shall
as
i
live
consume
a
fund
which
will
never
be
replenished
and
within
a
short
time
i
shall
be
compelled
to
work
for
my
living
maddened
by
this
last
reflection
he
dashed
into
the
street
hurried
northward
and
drowned
himself
in
the
regent
canal
just
where
it
runs
by
the
zoological
gardens
under
the
bridge
that
leads
to
the
cages
of
the
larger
pachyderms
thus
miserably
perished
peter
and
paul
the
one
in
the
thirtieth
the
other
in
the
year
of
his
age
both
victims
to
their
ignorance
of
fawcett
political
economy
for
the
the
bastiat
harmonies
the
fourth
council
of
lateran
on
unfruitful
loans
and
usury
the
speeches
of
sir
michael
and
brodrick
now
lord
midleton
the
sermons
of
thomas
under
the
head
usuria
lilly
first
in
and
other
works
too
numerous
to
mention
on
lords
miratus
i
have
often
wondered
why
men
were
blamed
for
seeking
to
know
men
of
title
that
a
man
should
be
blamed
for
the
acceptance
of
or
uniformity
with
ideals
not
his
own
is
right
enough
but
a
man
who
simply
reveres
a
lord
does
nothing
so
grave
and
why
he
should
not
revere
such
a
being
passes
my
comprehension
the
institution
of
lords
has
for
its
object
the
creation
of
a
high
and
reverend
class
well
a
man
looks
up
to
them
with
awe
or
expresses
his
reverence
and
forthwith
finds
himself
accused
get
rid
of
lords
by
all
means
if
you
think
there
should
be
none
but
do
not
come
pestering
me
with
a
rule
that
no
lord
shall
be
considered
while
you
are
making
them
by
the
bushel
for
the
special
purpose
of
being
considered
as
quintillian
has
it
in
his
highly
quintillianarian
essay
on
i
forget
what
i
have
heard
it
said
that
what
is
blamed
in
snobs
quid
is
not
the
matter
but
the
manner
of
their
worship
those
who
will
have
it
so
maintain
that
we
should
pay
to
rank
a
certain
discreet
respect
which
must
not
be
marred
by
crude
expression
they
compare
snobbishness
to
immodesty
and
profess
that
the
pleasure
of
acquaintance
with
the
great
should
be
so
enjoyed
that
the
great
themselves
are
but
of
the
homage
offered
them
this
is
rather
a
subtle
and
finicky
critique
of
what
is
in
honest
minds
a
natural
restraint
i
knew
a
man
once
chatterley
was
his
name
shropshire
his
county
and
racing
his
occupation
who
said
that
a
snob
was
blamed
for
the
offence
he
gave
to
lords
themselves
thus
we
do
well
said
this
man
chatterley
to
admire
beautiful
women
but
who
would
rush
into
a
room
and
exclaim
loudly
at
the
ladies
it
contained
so
said
this
man
chatterley
is
it
with
lords
whom
we
should
never
forget
but
whom
we
should
not
disturb
by
violent
affection
or
by
too
persistent
a
pursuit
then
there
was
a
nasty
drunken
chap
down
wapping
way
who
had
seen
better
days
he
had
views
on
dozens
of
things
and
they
were
often
worth
listening
to
and
one
of
his
fads
was
to
be
for
ever
preaching
that
the
whole
social
position
of
an
aristocracy
resided
in
a
veil
of
illusion
and
that
hands
laid
too
violently
on
this
veil
would
tear
it
it
was
only
by
a
sort
of
hypnotism
he
said
that
we
regarded
lords
as
separate
from
ourselves
it
was
a
dream
and
a
rough
movement
would
wake
one
out
of
it
snobbishness
he
said
did
violence
to
this
sacred
film
of
faith
and
might
shatter
it
and
hence
he
pointed
out
was
especially
hated
by
lords
themselves
it
was
interesting
to
hear
as
a
theory
and
delivered
in
those
surroundings
but
it
is
exploded
at
once
by
the
first
experience
of
high
life
and
its
solid
realities
there
is
yet
another
view
that
to
seek
after
acquaintance
with
men
of
position
in
some
way
hurts
one
own
soul
and
that
to
strain
towards
our
superiors
to
mingle
our
society
with
their
own
is
unworthy
because
it
is
destructive
of
something
peculiar
to
ourselves
but
surely
there
is
implanted
in
man
an
instinct
which
leads
him
to
all
his
noblest
efforts
and
which
is
indeed
the
motive
force
of
religion
the
instinct
by
which
he
will
ever
seek
to
attain
what
he
sees
to
be
superior
to
him
and
more
worthy
than
the
things
of
his
common
experience
it
seems
to
be
proper
therefore
that
no
man
should
struggle
against
the
very
natural
attraction
which
radiates
from
superior
rank
and
i
will
boldly
affirm
that
he
does
his
country
a
good
service
who
submits
to
this
force
the
just
appetite
for
rank
gives
rise
to
two
kinds
of
duty
one
or
the
other
of
which
each
of
us
in
his
sphere
is
bound
to
regard
there
is
first
for
much
the
greater
part
of
men
the
duty
of
showing
respect
and
deference
to
men
of
title
by
which
i
do
not
mean
only
lords
absolute
which
are
barons
viscounts
earls
marquises
and
dukes
but
also
lords
in
gross
that
is
the
whole
body
of
lords
including
lords
by
courtesy
ladies
their
wives
and
mothers
honourables
and
cousins
especially
heirs
of
lords
and
to
some
extent
baronets
as
well
secondly
there
is
the
duty
of
those
few
within
whose
power
it
lies
to
become
lords
lords
to
become
lest
the
aristocratic
element
in
our
constitution
should
decline
the
most
obvious
way
of
doing
one
duty
in
this
regard
if
one
is
wealthy
is
to
purchase
a
peerage
or
a
baronetcy
at
the
least
and
when
i
consider
how
very
numerous
are
the
fortunes
to
which
a
sum
of
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
pounds
is
not
really
a
sacrifice
and
how
few
of
their
possessors
exercise
a
tenacious
effort
to
acquire
rank
by
the
disbursement
of
money
i
can
not
but
fear
for
the
future
of
the
country
it
is
no
small
sign
of
our
times
that
we
should
read
so
continually
of
large
bequests
to
public
charities
made
by
men
who
have
had
every
opportunity
for
entering
the
upper
house
but
who
preferred
to
remain
unnoted
in
the
north
of
england
and
to
leave
their
posterity
no
more
dignified
than
they
were
themselves
there
is
a
yet
more
restricted
class
to
whom
it
is
open
to
become
lords
by
sheer
merit
the
one
by
gallant
conduct
in
the
field
another
by
a
pretty
talent
for
verse
a
third
by
scientific
research
and
if
any
of
my
readers
happen
to
be
a
man
of
this
kind
and
yet
hesitate
to
undertake
the
effort
required
of
him
i
would
point
out
that
our
constitution
in
its
wisdom
adds
certain
very
material
advantages
to
a
peerage
of
this
kind
it
is
no
excuse
for
a
man
of
military
or
scientific
eminence
to
say
that
his
income
would
not
enable
him
to
maintain
such
a
dignity
parliament
is
always
ready
to
vote
a
sufficient
grant
of
money
and
even
were
it
not
so
it
is
quite
possible
to
be
a
lord
and
yet
to
be
but
poorly
provided
with
the
perishable
goods
of
this
world
as
is
very
clearly
seen
in
the
case
of
no
fewer
than
barons
fourteen
earls
and
three
dukes
a
list
of
whom
i
had
prepared
for
printing
in
these
directions
but
have
most
unfortunately
mislaid
again
even
if
one
private
means
be
small
and
if
parliament
by
some
neglect
omit
to
endow
one
new
splendour
the
common
sense
of
england
will
come
to
the
help
of
any
man
so
situated
if
he
is
worth
his
salt
he
will
with
the
greatest
ease
obtain
positions
of
responsibility
and
emolument
notably
upon
the
directorate
of
public
companies
and
can
often
if
he
finds
his
salary
insufficient
persuade
his
to
increase
it
whether
by
threatening
them
with
exposure
or
by
some
other
less
drastic
and
more
convivial
means
if
after
reading
these
lines
there
is
anyone
who
still
doubts
the
attitude
that
an
honest
man
should
take
upon
this
matter
it
is
enough
to
point
out
in
conclusion
how
providence
itself
appears
to
have
designed
the
whole
hierarchy
of
lords
with
a
view
to
tempting
man
higher
and
ever
higher
thus
if
some
reader
of
this
happens
to
be
a
baron
he
might
think
perhaps
that
it
is
not
worth
a
further
effort
to
receive
another
grade
of
distinction
he
would
be
wrong
for
such
an
advance
gives
a
courtesy
title
to
his
daughters
one
more
step
and
the
same
benefit
accrues
to
his
sons
after
that
there
is
indeed
a
hiatus
nor
have
i
ever
been
able
to
see
what
advantage
is
held
out
to
the
viscount
who
desires
to
become
a
marquis
unless
indeed
it
be
marquises
that
become
viscounts
anyhow
it
is
the
latter
title
which
is
the
less
english
and
the
less
manly
and
which
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
is
proposed
to
abolish
by
a
short
bill
in
the
next
session
of
parliament
above
these
the
dukes
in
the
titles
of
their
wives
and
the
mode
in
which
they
are
addressed
stand
alone
there
is
therefore
no
stage
in
a
man
upward
progress
upon
this
ancient
and
glorious
ladder
where
he
will
not
find
some
great
reward
for
the
toil
of
ascending
in
view
of
these
things
i
for
my
part
hope
in
common
with
many
another
that
the
foolish
pledge
given
some
years
ago
when
the
liberal
party
was
in
opposition
that
it
would
create
no
more
lords
will
be
revised
now
that
it
has
to
consider
the
responsibilities
of
office
a
revision
for
which
there
is
ample
precedent
in
the
case
of
other
pledges
which
were
as
rashly
made
but
of
which
a
reconsideration
has
been
found
necessary
in
practice
find
i
am
wrong
upon
viscounts
but
as
i
did
not
discover
this
until
my
book
was
in
the
press
i
can
not
correct
it
the
remainder
of
the
matter
is
accurate
enough
and
may
be
relied
on
by
the
on
jingoes
in
the
shape
of
a
warning
being
the
sad
and
lamentable
history
of
jack
bull
son
of
the
late
john
bull
india
merchant
wherein
it
will
be
seen
how
this
prosperous
merchant
left
an
heir
that
ran
riot
with
trainbands
black
men
and
soldiers
and
squandered
all
his
substance
so
that
at
last
he
came
to
selling
penny
tokens
in
front
of
the
royal
exchange
in
threadneedle
street
and
is
now
very
miserably
writing
for
the
papers
john
bull
whom
i
knew
very
well
drove
a
great
trade
in
tea
cotton
goods
and
bombazine
as
also
in
hardware
all
manner
of
cutlery
good
and
bad
and
especially
and
was
very
highly
respected
in
the
city
of
london
of
which
he
was
twice
sheriff
and
once
lord
mayor
when
he
went
abroad
some
begged
of
him
and
to
these
he
would
give
a
million
or
so
at
a
time
openly
in
the
street
so
that
a
crowd
would
gather
and
cry
lord
what
a
generous
fellow
is
this
mr
bull
some
again
of
better
station
would
pluck
his
sleeve
and
take
him
aside
into
broad
street
corner
or
mansion
house
court
and
say
bull
a
word
in
your
ear
i
have
more
paper
about
than
i
care
for
in
these
hard
times
and
i
could
pay
you
handsomely
for
a
short
loan
these
always
found
bull
willing
and
ready
sure
and
silent
and
withal
cheaper
at
a
discount
than
any
other
for
buying
cloth
all
came
to
bull
and
for
buying
other
wares
his
house
was
preferred
to
those
of
frog
and
hans
and
the
rest
because
he
was
courteous
and
ready
always
to
be
found
in
his
office
which
was
near
the
in
leaden
hall
street
next
to
marlow
the
methodist
preacher
and
moreover
he
was
very
attentive
to
little
things
this
last
habit
he
would
call
the
soul
of
business
in
such
fashion
bull
had
accumulated
a
sum
of
five
hundred
thousand
million
pounds
or
thereabouts
and
when
he
died
the
neighbours
said
this
and
that
spiteful
thing
about
his
son
jack
whom
he
had
trained
up
to
the
business
making
out
that
knew
more
than
they
cared
to
that
was
not
that
had
heard
of
pride
going
before
a
and
so
much
as
jealousy
will
breed
but
they
were
very
much
disappointed
in
their
malice
for
this
same
jack
went
sturdily
to
work
and
trod
in
his
father
steps
so
that
his
wealth
increased
even
beyond
what
he
had
inherited
and
he
had
at
last
more
risks
upon
the
sea
in
one
way
and
another
than
any
other
merchant
in
the
city
and
if
you
would
know
how
jack
who
was
to
tell
the
truth
more
flighty
and
than
his
father
came
to
go
so
wisely
it
was
thus
old
john
had
left
him
a
few
directions
writ
up
in
pencil
on
the
mantelpiece
which
ran
in
this
way
never
go
into
an
adventure
unless
the
feeling
of
your
neighbours
be
with
you
spend
no
more
than
you
earn
nay
put
by
every
year
put
out
no
money
for
show
in
your
business
but
only
for
use
save
only
on
the
occasion
of
the
lord
mayor
show
your
taking
of
an
office
or
on
the
occasion
of
public
holidays
as
when
the
wife
or
daughter
lies
in
live
and
let
live
for
be
sure
your
business
can
only
thrive
on
the
condition
that
others
do
also
vex
no
man
at
your
door
buy
and
sell
freely
do
not
associate
with
drunkards
brawlers
and
poets
and
blessing
be
with
you
now
when
jack
was
grown
to
about
thirty
years
old
he
came
most
unfortunately
upon
a
certain
sir
john
snipe
that
was
a
very
scandalous
young
squire
of
oxfordshire
and
one
that
had
published
five
lyrics
and
a
play
enough
to
warn
any
bull
against
him
who
spoke
to
him
somewhat
in
this
fashion
la
jack
what
a
pity
you
and
i
should
live
so
separate
i
be
bound
you
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
the
very
backbone
of
the
country
to
be
sure
there
a
silly
lot
of
lumpkins
in
our
part
that
will
have
it
you
no
gentleman
but
i
say
is
as
gentle
does
and
fair
play
a
jewel
i
will
enter
your
as
soon
as
drink
to
you
as
i
do
here
whereat
jack
cried
god
mercy
a
very
kind
gentleman
be
welcome
to
my
house
pray
take
it
as
your
own
i
think
you
may
count
me
one
of
you
eh
be
seated
come
how
can
i
serve
you
and
at
last
he
had
this
jackanapes
taking
a
handsome
salary
for
doing
nothing
when
jack
friends
would
reproach
him
and
say
oh
jack
jack
beware
this
fine
gentleman
he
will
be
your
ruin
jack
would
answer
a
plague
on
all
levellers
or
again
what
if
he
be
a
gentleman
so
that
he
have
talent
is
all
i
seek
or
yet
further
well
gentle
or
simple
thank
god
he
an
honest
englishman
whereat
jack
added
to
the
firm
isaacs
of
hamburg
larochelle
of
canada
warramugga
of
van
dieman
land
smuts
bieken
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
the
maharajah
of
mahound
of
the
east
indies
that
was
a
plaguey
black
fellow
and
with
a
terrible
great
paunch
to
him
so
things
went
all
to
the
dogs
with
poor
jack
that
would
hear
no
sense
or
reason
from
his
father
old
friends
but
was
always
seen
arm
in
arm
with
sir
john
snipe
warra
mugga
the
maharajah
and
the
rest
drinking
at
the
sign
of
the
beerage
gambling
and
dicing
at
the
tape
or
playing
fisticuffs
at
the
lord
nelson
till
at
last
he
quarrelled
with
all
the
world
but
his
boon
companions
and
what
was
worse
boasted
that
his
father
brother
son
rich
jonathan
spare
was
of
the
company
so
if
he
met
some
dirty
dog
or
other
in
the
street
he
would
cry
come
and
sup
you
shall
meet
cousin
jonathan
and
when
no
jonathan
was
there
he
would
make
a
thousand
excuses
saying
excuse
jonathan
i
pray
you
he
has
married
a
damned
irish
wife
that
keeps
him
at
home
or
what
jonathan
not
come
oh
we
wait
awhile
he
never
fails
for
we
are
like
brothers
and
so
on
till
his
companions
came
to
think
at
last
that
he
had
never
met
or
known
jonathan
which
was
indeed
the
case
about
this
time
he
began
to
think
himself
too
fine
a
gentleman
to
live
over
the
shop
as
his
father
had
done
and
so
asked
sir
john
snipe
where
he
might
go
that
was
more
genteel
for
he
still
had
too
much
sense
to
ask
any
of
those
other
outlandish
fellows
advice
in
such
a
matter
at
last
on
snipe
bespeaking
he
went
to
wimbledon
which
is
a
vastly
smart
suburb
and
there
god
knows
he
fell
into
a
thousand
absurd
tricks
so
that
many
thought
he
was
off
his
head
he
hired
a
singing
man
to
stand
before
his
door
day
and
night
singing
vulgar
songs
out
of
the
street
in
praise
of
dick
turpin
and
molly
nog
only
forcing
him
to
put
in
his
name
of
jack
bull
in
the
place
of
the
murderer
or
oyster
wench
therein
celebrated
he
would
drink
rum
with
common
soldiers
in
the
and
then
ask
them
in
to
dinner
to
meet
gentlemen
saying
these
are
heroes
and
gentlemen
which
are
the
two
first
kinds
of
men
and
they
would
smoke
great
pipes
of
tobacco
in
his
very
to
the
general
disgust
he
would
run
out
and
cruelly
beat
small
boys
unaware
and
when
he
had
nigh
killed
them
he
would
come
back
and
sit
up
half
the
night
writing
an
account
of
how
he
had
fought
tom
mauler
of
bermondsey
and
beaten
him
in
a
hundred
and
two
rounds
which
he
would
add
no
man
living
but
he
could
do
he
would
hang
out
of
his
window
a
great
flag
with
a
challenge
on
it
to
all
the
people
of
wimbledon
assembled
or
to
any
of
them
singly
and
then
he
would
be
seen
at
his
front
gate
waving
a
great
red
flag
and
gnawing
a
bone
like
a
dog
saying
that
he
loved
force
only
and
would
fight
all
and
any
when
he
received
any
print
newspaper
book
or
pamphlet
that
praised
any
but
himself
he
would
throw
it
into
the
fire
in
a
kind
of
frenzy
calling
god
to
witness
that
he
was
the
only
person
of
consequence
in
the
world
that
it
was
a
horrible
shame
that
he
was
so
neglected
and
lord
knows
what
other
rubbish
in
this
spirit
he
quarrelled
with
all
his
and
friends
and
comrades
and
that
in
the
most
insolent
way
for
knowing
well
that
frog
had
a
shrew
of
a
wife
he
wrote
to
him
daily
asking
if
he
had
had
a
domestic
broil
of
late
and
how
his
poor
head
felt
since
it
was
bandaged
to
hans
who
lived
in
a
small
way
and
loved
gardening
he
sent
an
express
begging
him
to
mind
his
cabbages
and
leave
gentlemen
to
their
greater
affairs
to
niccolini
of
savoy
the
little
swarthy
merchant
he
sent
indeed
a
more
polite
note
but
as
he
said
in
it
that
he
would
be
very
willing
to
give
him
charity
and
help
him
as
he
could
and
as
he
added
for
my
father
it
was
that
put
you
up
in
business
which
was
a
monstrous
lie
for
frog
had
done
this
he
did
but
offend
then
to
william
eagle
that
was
a
strutting
arrogant
fellow
but
willing
to
be
a
friend
he
wrote
every
monday
to
say
that
the
house
of
bull
was
lost
unless
eagle
would
very
kindly
protect
it
and
every
thursday
to
challenge
him
to
mortal
combat
so
that
eagle
who
to
tell
the
truth
was
no
great
wit
but
something
of
a
dullard
and
moreover
suffering
from
a
gathering
in
the
ear
a
withered
arm
and
poor
blood
gave
up
his
friendship
and
business
with
bull
and
took
to
making
up
sermons
and
speeches
for
orators
he
would
have
no
retainers
but
two
whose
common
names
were
hocus
and
pocus
but
as
he
hated
the
use
of
common
names
and
as
no
one
had
heard
of
hocus
lineage
nor
did
he
himself
know
it
he
called
him
hocus
freedom
as
being
a
and
moral
name
for
a
footman
and
pocus
whose
name
was
of
an
ordinary
decent
kind
he
called
glory
as
being
a
good
counterweight
to
freedom
both
these
were
names
in
his
opinion
very
decent
and
well
suited
for
a
gentleman
servants
now
freedom
and
glory
got
together
in
the
apple
closet
and
put
it
to
each
other
that
as
their
master
was
evidently
mad
it
would
be
a
thousand
pities
to
take
no
advantage
of
it
and
they
agreed
that
whatever
bit
of
jobbing
hocus
freedom
should
do
pocus
glory
should
approve
and
contrariwise
about
but
they
kept
up
a
sham
quarrel
to
mask
this
thus
hocus
was
for
chapel
pocus
for
church
and
it
was
agreed
hocus
should
denounce
pocus
for
drinking
port
the
first
fruit
of
their
conspiracy
was
that
hocus
recommended
his
brother
and
sister
his
two
aunts
and
nieces
and
four
nephews
his
own
six
children
his
dog
his
his
laundress
his
secretary
a
friend
of
whom
he
had
once
borrowed
five
pounds
and
a
blind
beggar
whom
he
favoured
to
various
posts
about
the
house
and
to
certain
pensions
and
these
jack
bull
though
his
fortune
was
already
dwindling
at
once
accepted
thereupon
pocus
loudly
reproached
hocus
in
the
servants
hall
saying
that
the
compact
had
only
stood
for
things
in
reason
whereat
hocus
took
off
his
coat
and
offered
to
take
him
on
and
pocus
thinking
better
of
it
managed
for
his
share
to
place
in
the
household
such
relatives
as
he
could
namely
cohen
to
whom
he
was
in
debt
bernstein
his
and
all
his
family
of
five
except
little
hugh
that
blacked
the
boots
for
the
priest
and
so
was
already
well
provided
for
in
this
way
poor
jack
fortune
went
to
rack
and
ruin
the
clerks
in
his
office
in
the
city
whom
he
now
never
saw
would
telegraph
to
him
every
day
that
there
was
loss
that
had
to
be
met
but
to
these
he
always
sent
the
same
reply
namely
sell
stock
and
scrip
to
the
amount
and
as
that
phrase
was
costly
he
made
a
to
wit
prosperity
stand
for
it
till
one
day
they
sent
word
there
is
nothing
left
then
he
bethought
him
how
to
live
on
credit
but
this
plan
was
very
much
hampered
by
his
habit
of
turning
in
a
passion
on
all
those
who
did
not
continually
praise
him
did
an
honest
man
look
in
and
say
jack
there
is
a
goat
eating
your
cabbages
he
would
fly
into
a
rage
and
say
you
lie
my
cabbages
are
sacred
and
jove
would
strike
the
goat
dead
that
dared
to
eat
them
or
if
a
poor
fellow
should
touch
his
hat
in
the
street
and
say
pardon
sir
your
buttons
are
awry
he
would
answer
off
villain
zounds
knave
know
you
not
that
my
divine
buttons
are
the
model
of
things
and
so
forth
until
he
fell
into
a
perfect
lunacy
but
of
how
he
came
to
selling
tokens
of
little
leaden
soldiers
at
a
penny
in
front
of
the
exchange
and
of
how
at
last
he
even
fell
to
writing
for
the
papers
i
will
not
tell
you
for
it
has
not
happened
yet
nor
do
i
think
it
will
and
in
the
second
place
i
am
tired
of
writing
on
a
winged
horse
and
the
exile
who
rode
him
it
so
happened
that
one
day
i
was
riding
my
horse
monster
in
the
berkshire
hills
right
up
above
that
white
horse
which
was
dug
they
say
by
this
man
and
by
that
man
but
no
one
knows
by
whom
for
i
was
seeing
england
a
delightful
pastime
but
a
somewhat
anxious
one
if
one
is
riding
a
horse
for
if
one
is
alone
one
can
sleep
where
one
chooses
and
walk
at
one
ease
and
eat
what
god
sends
one
and
spend
what
one
has
but
when
one
is
responsible
for
any
other
being
especially
a
horse
there
come
in
a
thousand
farradiddles
for
of
everything
that
walks
on
earth
man
not
woman
i
use
the
word
in
the
restricted
sense
is
the
freest
and
the
most
unhappy
well
then
i
was
riding
my
horse
and
exploring
the
island
of
england
going
eastward
of
a
summer
afternoon
and
i
had
so
ridden
along
the
ridge
of
the
hills
for
some
miles
when
i
came
as
chance
would
have
it
upon
a
very
extraordinary
being
he
was
a
man
like
myself
but
his
horse
which
was
grazing
by
his
side
and
from
time
to
time
snorting
in
a
proud
manner
was
quite
unlike
my
own
this
horse
had
all
the
strength
of
the
horses
of
normandy
all
the
lightness
grace
and
subtlety
of
the
horses
of
barbary
all
the
conscious
value
of
the
horses
that
race
for
rich
men
all
the
humour
of
old
horses
that
have
seen
the
world
and
will
be
disturbed
by
nothing
and
all
the
valour
of
young
horses
who
have
their
troubles
before
them
and
race
round
in
paddocks
attempting
to
defeat
the
passing
trains
i
say
all
these
things
were
in
the
horse
and
expressed
by
various
movements
of
his
body
but
the
list
of
these
qualities
is
but
a
hint
of
the
way
in
which
he
bore
himself
for
it
was
quite
clearly
apparent
as
i
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
this
strange
pair
that
the
horse
before
me
was
very
different
as
perhaps
was
the
man
from
the
beings
that
inhabit
this
island
while
he
was
different
in
all
qualities
that
i
have
mentioned
or
rather
in
their
combination
he
also
differed
physically
from
most
horses
that
we
know
in
this
that
from
his
sides
and
clapt
along
them
in
repose
was
growing
a
pair
of
very
fine
sedate
and
noble
wings
so
habited
with
such
an
expression
and
with
such
gestures
of
his
limbs
he
browsed
upon
the
grass
of
berkshire
which
if
you
except
the
grass
of
sussex
and
the
grass
perhaps
of
hampshire
is
the
sweetest
grass
in
the
world
i
speak
of
the
as
for
the
grass
of
the
valleys
i
would
not
eat
it
in
a
salad
let
alone
give
it
to
a
beast
the
man
who
was
the
companion
rather
than
the
master
of
this
charming
animal
sat
upon
a
lump
of
turf
singing
gently
to
himself
and
looking
over
the
plain
of
central
england
the
plain
of
the
upper
thames
which
men
may
see
from
these
hills
he
looked
at
it
with
a
mixture
of
curiosity
of
memory
and
of
desire
which
was
very
interesting
but
also
a
little
pathetic
to
watch
and
as
he
looked
at
it
he
went
on
crooning
his
little
song
until
he
saw
me
when
with
great
courtesy
he
ceased
and
asked
me
in
the
english
language
whether
i
did
not
desire
companionship
i
answered
him
that
certainly
i
did
though
not
more
than
was
commonly
the
case
with
me
for
i
told
him
that
i
had
had
companionship
in
several
towns
and
inns
during
the
past
few
days
and
that
i
had
had
but
a
few
hours
bout
of
silence
and
of
loneliness
which
period
i
added
is
not
more
than
sufficient
for
a
man
of
my
years
though
i
confess
that
in
early
youth
i
should
have
found
it
intolerable
when
i
had
said
this
he
nodded
gravely
and
i
in
my
turn
began
to
wonder
of
what
age
he
might
be
for
his
eyes
and
his
whole
manner
were
young
but
there
was
a
certain
knowledge
and
gravity
in
his
expression
and
in
the
posture
of
his
body
which
in
another
might
have
betrayed
middle
age
he
wore
no
hat
but
a
great
quantity
of
his
own
hair
which
was
blown
about
by
the
light
summer
wind
upon
these
heights
as
he
did
not
reply
to
me
i
asked
him
a
further
question
and
said
i
see
you
are
gazing
upon
the
plain
have
you
interests
or
memories
in
that
view
i
ask
you
without
compunction
so
delicate
a
question
because
it
is
as
open
to
you
to
lie
as
it
was
to
me
when
i
lied
to
them
only
yesterday
morning
a
little
beyond
wayland
cave
telling
them
that
i
had
come
to
make
sure
of
the
spot
where
george
conquered
the
dragon
though
in
truth
i
had
come
for
no
such
purpose
and
telling
them
that
my
name
was
whereas
it
was
nothing
of
the
kind
he
brightened
up
at
this
and
said
you
are
quite
right
in
telling
me
that
i
am
free
to
lie
if
i
choose
and
i
would
be
very
happy
to
lie
to
you
if
there
were
any
purpose
in
so
doing
but
there
is
none
i
gaze
upon
this
plain
with
the
memories
that
are
common
to
all
men
when
they
gaze
upon
a
landscape
in
which
they
have
had
a
part
in
the
years
recently
gone
by
that
is
the
plain
fills
me
with
a
sort
of
longing
and
yet
i
can
not
say
that
the
plain
has
treated
me
unjustly
i
have
no
complaint
against
it
god
bless
the
plain
after
thinking
a
few
moments
he
added
i
am
fond
of
wantage
wallingford
has
done
me
no
harm
oxford
gave
me
many
companions
i
was
not
drowned
at
dorchester
beyond
the
little
hills
and
the
best
of
men
gave
me
a
true
farewell
in
faringdon
yonder
moreover
cumnor
is
my
friend
nevertheless
i
like
to
indulge
in
a
sort
of
sadness
when
i
look
over
this
plain
i
then
asked
him
whither
he
would
go
next
he
answered
my
horse
flies
and
i
am
therefore
not
bound
to
any
particular
track
or
goal
especially
in
these
light
airs
of
summer
when
all
the
heaven
is
open
to
me
as
he
said
this
i
looked
at
his
mount
and
noticed
that
when
he
shook
his
skin
as
horses
will
do
in
the
hot
weather
to
rid
themselves
of
flies
he
also
passed
a
little
tremor
through
his
wings
which
were
large
and
and
spreading
gently
under
that
effort
seemed
to
give
him
coolness
you
have
said
i
a
remarkable
horse
at
this
word
he
brightened
up
as
men
do
when
something
is
spoken
of
that
interests
them
nearly
and
he
answered
indeed
i
have
and
i
am
very
glad
you
like
him
there
is
no
such
other
horse
to
my
knowledge
in
england
though
i
have
heard
that
some
still
linger
in
ireland
and
in
france
and
that
a
few
foals
of
the
breed
have
been
dropped
of
late
years
in
italy
but
i
have
not
seen
them
how
did
you
come
by
this
horse
said
i
if
it
is
not
trespassing
upon
your
courtesy
to
ask
you
so
delicate
a
question
not
at
all
not
at
all
he
answered
this
kind
of
horse
runs
wild
upon
the
heaths
of
morning
and
can
be
caught
only
by
exiles
and
i
am
one
moreover
if
you
had
come
three
or
four
years
later
than
you
have
i
should
have
been
able
to
give
you
an
answer
in
rhyme
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
a
pestilent
stricture
of
the
imagination
or
rather
of
the
compositive
faculty
so
constrains
me
that
i
have
not
yet
finished
the
poem
i
have
been
writing
with
regard
to
the
discovery
and
service
of
this
beast
i
have
great
sympathy
with
you
i
answered
i
have
been
at
the
ballade
of
since
the
year
and
i
have
not
yet
completed
it
well
then
he
said
you
will
be
patient
with
me
when
i
tell
you
that
i
have
but
three
verses
completed
whereupon
without
further
invitation
he
sang
in
a
loud
and
clear
voice
the
following
verse
ten
years
ago
you
turned
me
out
of
doors
to
cut
my
feet
on
flinty
lands
and
stumble
down
the
shores
and
i
thought
about
the
all
in
all
the
in
i
said
is
weak
he
was
immensely
pleased
with
this
and
standing
up
seized
me
by
the
hand
i
know
you
now
he
said
for
a
man
who
does
indeed
write
verse
i
have
done
everything
i
could
with
those
three
syllables
and
by
the
grace
of
heaven
i
shall
get
them
right
in
time
anyhow
they
are
the
of
the
moment
and
with
your
leave
i
shall
reserve
them
for
i
do
not
wish
to
put
words
like
tum
into
the
middle
of
my
verse
i
bowed
to
him
and
he
proceeded
i
thought
about
the
all
in
all
and
more
than
i
could
tell
but
i
caught
a
horse
to
ride
upon
and
rode
him
very
well
he
had
flame
behind
the
eyes
of
him
and
wings
upon
his
side
and
i
ride
and
i
ride
of
how
many
verses
do
you
intend
this
metrical
composition
to
be
said
i
with
great
interest
i
have
sketched
out
thirteen
said
he
firmly
but
i
confess
that
the
next
ten
are
so
embryonic
in
this
year
that
i
can
not
sing
them
in
public
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
added
they
have
many
fine
single
lines
but
there
is
as
yet
no
composition
or
unity
about
them
and
as
he
recited
the
words
composition
and
unity
he
waved
his
hand
about
like
a
man
sketching
a
cartoon
give
me
then
said
i
at
any
rate
the
last
two
for
i
had
rapidly
calculated
how
many
would
remain
of
his
scheme
he
was
indeed
pleased
to
be
so
challenged
and
continued
to
sing
once
atop
of
lambourne
down
towards
the
hill
of
clere
i
saw
the
host
of
heaven
in
rank
and
michael
with
his
spear
and
turpin
out
of
gascony
and
charlemagne
the
lord
and
roland
of
the
marches
with
his
hand
upon
his
sword
for
fear
he
should
have
need
of
it
and
forty
more
beside
and
i
ride
and
i
ride
for
you
that
took
the
all
in
all
that
again
is
weak
i
murmured
you
are
quite
right
he
said
gravely
i
will
rub
it
out
then
he
went
on
you
that
took
the
all
in
all
the
things
you
left
were
three
a
loud
voice
for
singing
and
keen
eyes
to
see
and
a
spouting
well
of
joy
within
that
never
yet
was
dried
and
i
ride
he
sang
this
last
in
so
fierce
and
so
exultant
a
manner
that
i
was
impressed
more
than
i
cared
to
say
but
not
more
than
i
cared
to
show
as
for
him
he
cared
little
whether
i
was
impressed
or
not
he
was
exalted
and
detached
from
the
world
there
were
no
stirrups
upon
the
beast
he
vaulted
upon
it
and
said
as
he
did
so
you
have
put
me
into
the
mood
and
i
must
get
away
and
though
the
words
were
abrupt
he
speak
them
with
such
a
grace
that
i
will
always
remember
them
he
then
touched
the
flanks
of
his
horse
with
his
heels
on
which
there
were
no
spurs
and
at
once
beating
the
air
powerfully
twice
or
thrice
with
its
wings
it
spurned
the
turf
of
berkshire
and
made
out
southward
and
upward
into
the
sunlit
air
a
pleasing
and
a
glorious
sight
in
a
very
little
while
they
had
dwindled
to
a
point
of
light
and
were
soon
mixed
with
the
sky
but
i
went
on
more
lonely
along
the
crest
of
the
hills
very
human
riding
my
horse
monster
a
mortal
horse
i
had
almost
written
a
human
horse
my
mind
was
full
of
silence
some
of
those
to
whom
i
have
related
this
adventure
criticise
it
by
the
method
of
questions
and
of
proving
that
it
could
not
have
happened
precisely
where
it
did
showing
that
i
left
the
vale
so
late
in
the
afternoon
that
i
could
not
have
found
this
man
and
his
mount
at
the
hour
i
say
i
did
and
making
all
manner
of
comments
upon
the
exact
way
in
which
the
feathers
which
they
say
are
those
of
a
bird
grew
out
of
the
hide
of
the
horse
and
so
forth
there
are
no
witnesses
of
the
matter
and
i
go
lonely
for
many
people
will
not
believe
and
those
who
do
believe
believe
too
much
on
a
man
and
his
burden
once
there
was
a
man
who
lived
in
a
house
at
the
corner
of
a
wood
with
an
excellent
landscape
upon
every
side
a
village
about
one
mile
off
and
a
pleasant
stream
flowing
over
chalk
and
full
of
trout
for
which
he
used
to
fish
this
man
was
perfectly
happy
for
some
little
time
fishing
for
the
trout
contemplating
the
shapes
of
clouds
in
the
sky
and
singing
all
the
songs
he
could
remember
in
turn
under
the
high
wood
till
one
day
he
found
to
his
annoyance
that
there
was
strapped
to
his
back
a
burden
however
he
was
by
nature
of
a
merry
mood
and
began
thinking
of
all
the
things
he
had
read
about
burdens
he
remembered
an
uncle
of
his
called
jonas
ridiculous
name
who
had
pointed
out
that
burdens
especially
if
borne
in
youth
strengthen
the
upper
deltoid
muscle
expand
the
chest
and
give
to
the
whole
figure
an
erect
and
graceful
poise
he
remembered
also
reading
in
a
book
upon
country
sports
that
the
bearing
of
heavy
weights
is
an
excellent
training
for
all
other
forms
of
exercise
and
produces
a
manly
and
resolute
carriage
very
useful
in
golf
cricket
and
colonial
wars
he
could
not
forget
his
mother
frequent
remark
that
a
burden
nobly
endured
gave
firmness
and
at
the
same
time
elasticity
to
the
character
and
altogether
he
went
about
his
way
taking
it
as
kindly
as
he
could
but
i
will
not
deny
that
it
annoyed
him
in
a
few
days
he
discovered
that
during
sleep
when
he
lay
down
the
burden
annoyed
him
somewhat
less
than
at
other
times
though
the
memory
of
it
never
completely
left
him
he
would
therefore
sleep
for
a
very
considerable
number
of
hours
every
day
sometimes
retiring
to
rest
as
early
as
nine
nor
rising
till
noon
of
the
next
day
he
discovered
also
that
rapid
and
loud
conversation
adventure
wine
beer
the
theatre
cards
travel
and
so
forth
made
him
forget
his
burden
for
the
time
being
and
he
indulged
himself
perhaps
to
excess
in
all
these
things
but
when
the
memory
of
his
burden
would
return
to
him
after
each
indulgence
whether
working
in
his
garden
or
fishing
for
trout
or
on
a
lonely
walk
he
began
reluctantly
to
admit
that
on
the
whole
he
felt
uncertainty
and
doubt
as
to
whether
the
burden
was
really
good
for
him
in
this
unpleasing
attitude
of
mind
he
had
the
good
fortune
one
day
to
meet
with
an
excellent
divine
who
inhabited
a
neighbouring
parish
and
was
possessed
of
no
less
a
sum
than
this
ecclesiastic
seeing
his
whilom
jocund
face
fretted
with
the
marks
of
care
put
a
hand
gently
upon
his
shoulder
and
said
my
young
friend
i
easily
perceive
that
you
are
put
out
by
this
burden
which
you
bear
upon
your
shoulders
i
am
indeed
surprised
that
one
so
intelligent
should
take
such
a
matter
so
what
do
you
not
know
that
burdens
are
the
common
lot
of
humanity
i
myself
though
you
may
little
suspect
it
bear
a
burden
far
heavier
than
yours
though
true
it
is
invisible
and
not
strapped
on
to
my
shoulders
by
gross
material
thongs
of
leather
as
is
yours
the
worthy
squire
of
our
parish
bears
one
too
and
with
what
manliness
what
ease
what
abnegation
believe
me
these
other
burdens
of
which
you
never
hear
and
which
no
man
can
perceive
are
for
that
very
reason
the
heaviest
and
the
most
trying
come
play
the
man
little
by
little
you
will
find
that
the
patient
sustenance
of
this
burden
will
make
you
something
greater
stronger
nobler
than
you
were
and
you
will
notice
as
you
grow
older
that
those
who
are
most
favoured
by
the
unseen
bear
the
heaviest
of
such
impediments
with
these
last
words
recited
in
a
solemn
and
as
it
were
an
inspired
voice
the
hierarch
lifted
an
immense
stone
from
the
roadway
and
placing
it
on
the
top
of
the
burden
so
as
considerably
to
add
to
its
weight
went
on
his
way
the
irritation
of
the
man
was
already
considerable
when
his
family
called
upon
him
his
mother
that
is
his
younger
sister
his
cousin
jane
and
her
husband
and
after
they
had
eaten
some
of
his
food
and
drunk
some
of
his
beer
they
all
sat
out
in
the
garden
with
him
and
talked
to
him
somewhat
in
this
manner
we
really
can
not
pity
you
much
for
ever
since
you
were
a
child
whatever
evil
has
happened
to
you
has
been
your
own
doing
and
probably
this
is
no
different
from
the
rest
what
can
have
possessed
you
to
get
putting
upon
your
back
an
ugly
useless
and
dangerous
great
burden
you
have
no
idea
how
utterly
out
of
fashion
you
seem
stumbling
about
the
roads
like
a
clodhopper
and
going
up
and
downstairs
as
though
you
were
on
the
treadmill
for
the
lord
sake
at
least
have
the
decency
to
stay
at
home
and
not
to
disgrace
the
family
with
your
miserable
appearance
having
said
so
much
they
rose
and
adding
to
his
burden
a
number
of
leaden
weights
they
had
brought
with
them
went
on
their
way
and
left
him
to
his
own
thoughts
you
may
well
imagine
that
by
this
time
the
irritation
of
the
man
had
gone
almost
past
bearing
he
would
quarrel
with
his
best
friends
and
they
in
revenge
would
put
something
more
on
to
the
burden
till
he
felt
he
would
break
down
it
haunted
his
dreams
and
filled
most
of
his
waking
thoughts
and
did
all
those
things
which
burdens
have
been
discovered
to
do
since
the
beginning
of
time
until
at
last
though
very
reluctantly
he
determined
to
be
rid
of
it
upon
hearing
of
this
resolution
his
friends
and
acquaintances
raised
a
most
fearful
hubbub
some
talked
of
sending
for
the
police
others
of
restraining
him
by
force
and
others
again
of
putting
him
into
an
asylum
but
he
broke
away
from
them
all
and
making
for
the
open
road
went
out
to
see
if
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
this
abominable
strain
of
himself
he
could
not
for
the
burden
was
so
cunningly
strapped
on
that
his
hands
could
not
reach
it
and
there
was
magic
about
it
and
a
spell
but
he
thought
somewhere
there
must
be
someone
who
could
tell
him
how
to
cast
it
away
in
the
very
first
he
came
to
he
discovered
what
is
common
to
such
places
namely
a
batch
of
politicians
who
laughed
at
him
very
loudly
for
not
knowing
how
to
get
rid
of
burdens
it
is
done
they
said
by
the
very
simple
method
of
paying
one
of
us
to
get
on
top
and
undo
the
straps
this
the
man
said
he
would
be
very
willing
to
do
whereat
the
politicians
having
fought
somewhat
among
themselves
for
the
money
desisted
at
last
in
favour
of
the
most
vulgar
who
climbed
on
to
the
top
of
the
man
burden
and
remained
there
viewing
the
landscape
and
commenting
in
general
terms
upon
the
nature
of
public
affairs
and
when
the
man
complained
a
little
the
politician
did
but
cuff
him
sharply
on
the
side
of
the
head
to
teach
him
better
manners
yet
a
little
further
on
he
met
with
a
scientist
who
told
him
in
english
greek
a
clear
and
simple
method
of
getting
rid
of
the
burden
and
since
the
man
did
not
seem
to
understand
he
lost
his
temper
and
said
come
let
me
do
it
and
climbed
up
by
the
side
of
the
politician
once
there
the
scientist
confessed
that
the
problem
was
not
so
easy
as
he
had
imagined
but
said
he
now
that
i
am
here
you
may
as
well
carry
me
for
it
will
be
no
great
additional
weight
and
meanwhile
i
will
spend
most
of
my
time
in
trying
to
set
you
free
and
the
third
man
he
met
was
a
philosopher
with
quiet
eyes
a
person
whose
very
gestures
were
profound
taking
by
the
hand
the
man
now
fevered
and
despairing
he
looked
at
him
with
a
mixture
of
comprehension
and
charity
and
he
said
my
poor
fellow
your
eyes
are
very
wild
and
staring
and
bloodshot
how
little
you
understand
the
world
then
he
smiled
gently
and
said
will
you
never
learn
and
without
another
word
he
climbed
up
on
the
top
of
the
burden
and
seated
himself
by
the
side
of
the
other
two
after
this
the
man
went
mad
the
last
time
i
saw
him
he
was
wandering
down
the
road
with
his
burden
very
much
increased
he
was
bearing
not
only
these
original
three
but
some
kings
and
and
schoolmasters
several
and
an
old
admiral
he
was
blind
and
they
were
goading
him
but
as
he
passed
me
he
smiled
and
gibbered
a
little
and
told
me
it
was
in
the
nature
of
things
and
went
on
downward
stumbling
parable
i
think
as
i
it
demands
a
key
lest
it
prove
a
to
the
and
a
perplexity
to
the
foolish
here
then
is
the
key

that
burden
which

often
feel
themselves
to

to

in

that
with
this

the
parable
will
be
clear
to
on
a
fisherman
and
the
quest
of
peace
in
that
part
of
the
thames
where
the
river
begins
to
feel
its
life
before
it
knows
its
name
the
counties
play
with
it
upon
either
side
it
is
not
yet
a
boundary
the
parishes
upon
the
northern
bank
are
sometimes
as
truly
wiltshire
as
those
to
the
south
the
men
upon
the
farms
that
look
at
each
other
over
the
water
are
close
neighbours
they
use
the
same
words
and
the
way
they
build
their
houses
is
the
same
between
them
runs
the
beginning
of
the
thames
from
the
surface
of
the
water
the
whole
prospect
is
sky
bounded
by
reeds
but
sitting
up
in
one
canoe
one
sees
between
the
reeds
distant
hills
to
the
southward
or
on
the
north
trees
in
groups
and
now
and
then
the
roofs
of
a
village
more
often
the
lonely
group
of
a
steading
with
a
church
close
by
floating
down
this
stream
quite
silently
but
rather
swiftly
upon
a
summer
day
i
saw
on
the
bank
to
my
right
a
very
pleasant
man
he
was
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
or
two
hundred
ahead
of
me
when
i
first
caught
sight
of
him
and
perceived
that
he
was
a
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
he
was
fishing
he
was
dressed
in
black
even
his
hat
was
black
though
it
was
of
straw
but
his
collar
was
of
such
a
kind
as
his
ancestors
had
worn
turned
down
and
surrounded
by
a
soft
white
tie
his
face
was
clear
and
ruddy
his
eyes
honest
his
hair
already
grey
and
he
was
gazing
intently
upon
the
float
for
i
will
not
conceal
it
that
he
was
fishing
in
that
ancient
manner
with
a
float
shaped
like
a
and
stuck
through
with
a
quill
so
fish
the
yeomen
to
this
day
in
northern
france
and
in
holland
upon
such
immutable
customs
does
an
ancient
state
repose
which
if
they
are
disturbed
there
is
danger
of
its
dissolution
as
i
so
looked
at
him
and
rapidly
approached
him
i
took
care
not
to
disturb
the
water
with
my
paddle
but
to
let
the
boat
glide
far
from
his
side
until
in
the
pleasure
of
watching
him
i
got
fast
upon
the
further
reeds
there
she
held
and
i
knowing
that
the
effort
of
getting
her
off
would
seriously
stir
the
water
lay
still
nor
did
i
speak
to
him
though
he
pleased
me
so
much
because
a
friend
of
mine
in
lambourne
had
once
told
me
that
of
all
things
in
nature
what
a
fish
most
fears
is
the
voice
of
a
man
he
however
first
spoke
to
me
in
a
sort
of
easy
tone
that
could
frighten
no
fish
he
said
hullo
i
answered
him
in
a
very
subdued
voice
for
i
have
no
art
where
fishes
are
concerned
hullo
then
he
asked
me
after
a
good
long
time
whether
his
watch
was
right
and
as
he
asked
me
he
pulled
out
his
which
was
a
large
thick
golden
watch
and
looked
at
it
with
anxiety
and
dread
he
asked
me
this
i
think
because
i
must
have
had
the
look
of
a
tired
man
fresh
from
the
towns
and
with
the
london
time
upon
him
and
yet
i
had
been
for
weeks
in
no
town
larger
than
cricklade
moreover
i
had
no
watch
since
none
the
less
it
is
one
duty
to
uplift
sustain
and
comfort
all
one
fellows
i
told
him
that
his
watch
was
but
half
a
minute
fast
and
he
put
it
back
with
a
greater
content
than
he
had
taken
it
out
and
indeed
anyone
who
blames
me
for
what
i
did
in
so
assuring
him
of
the
time
should
remember
that
i
had
other
means
than
a
watch
for
judging
it
the
sunlight
was
already
full
of
old
kindness
the
midges
were
active
the
shadow
of
the
reeds
on
the
river
was
of
a
particular
colour
the
haze
of
a
particular
warmth
no
one
who
had
passed
many
days
and
nights
together
sleeping
out
and
living
out
under
this
rare
summer
could
mistake
the
hour
in
a
little
while
i
asked
him
whether
he
had
caught
any
fish
he
said
he
had
not
actually
caught
any
but
that
he
would
have
caught
several
but
for
accidents
which
he
explained
to
me
in
technical
language
then
he
asked
me
in
his
turn
where
i
was
going
to
that
evening
i
said
i
had
no
object
before
me
that
i
would
sleep
when
i
felt
sleepy
and
wake
when
i
felt
wakeful
and
that
i
would
so
drift
down
thames
till
i
came
to
anything
unpleasant
when
it
was
my
design
to
leave
my
canoe
at
once
to
tie
it
up
to
a
post
and
to
go
off
to
another
place
for
i
told
him
i
am
here
to
think
about
peace
and
to
see
if
she
can
be
found
when
i
said
this
his
face
became
moody
and
as
though
such
portentous
thoughts
required
action
to
balance
them
he
strained
his
line
lifted
his
float
smartly
from
the
water
so
that
i
saw
the
hook
flying
through
the
air
with
a
quarter
of
a
worm
upon
it
and
brought
it
down
far
up
the
stream
then
he
let
it
go
slowly
down
again
as
the
water
carried
it
and
instead
of
watching
it
with
his
steady
and
experienced
eyes
he
looked
up
at
me
and
asked
me
if
as
yet
i
had
come
upon
any
clue
to
peace
that
i
expected
to
find
her
between
cricklade
and
bablock
hythe
i
answered
that
i
did
not
exactly
expect
to
find
her
that
i
had
come
out
to
think
about
her
and
to
find
out
whether
she
could
be
found
i
told
him
that
often
and
often
as
i
wandered
over
the
earth
i
had
clearly
seen
her
as
once
in
auvergne
by
once
in
terneuzen
several
times
in
hazlemere
hampstead
clapham
and
other
suburbs
and
more
often
than
i
could
tell
in
the
weald
but
seeing
her
said
i
is
one
thing
and
holding
her
is
another
i
hardly
propose
to
follow
all
her
ways
but
i
do
propose
to
consider
her
nature
until
i
know
so
much
as
to
be
able
to
discover
her
at
last
whenever
i
have
need
for
i
am
convinced
by
this
time
that
nothing
else
is
worth
the
effort
of
a
man
and
i
think
i
shall
achieve
my
object
somewhere
between
here
and
bablock
hythe
he
told
me
without
interest
that
there
was
nothing
attractive
in
the
pursuit
or
in
its
realisation
i
answered
with
equal
promptitude
that
the
whole
of
attraction
was
summed
up
in
it
that
to
nothing
else
did
we
move
by
nature
and
to
nothing
else
were
we
drawn
but
to
peace
i
said
that
a
completion
and
a
fulfilment
were
vaguely
demanded
by
a
man
even
in
very
early
youth
that
in
manhood
the
desire
for
them
became
a
passion
and
in
early
middle
age
so
overmastering
and
natural
a
necessity
that
all
who
turned
aside
from
it
and
attempted
to
forget
it
were
justly
despised
by
their
fellows
and
were
some
of
them
some
of
them
sybarites
but
all
of
them
perverted
men
whose
hard
eyes
weak
mouths
and
fear
of
every
trial
sufficiently
proved
the
curse
that
was
upon
them
i
told
him
as
heatedly
as
one
can
speak
lying
back
in
a
canoe
to
a
man
beyond
a
little
river
that
he
being
older
than
i
should
know
that
everything
in
a
full
man
tended
towards
some
place
where
expression
is
permanent
and
secure
and
then
i
told
him
that
since
i
had
only
seen
such
a
place
far
off
as
it
were
but
never
lived
in
i
had
set
forth
to
see
if
i
might
think
out
the
way
to
it
and
i
hope
i
said
to
finish
the
problem
not
so
far
down
as
bablock
hythe
but
nearer
by
towards
new
bridge
or
even
higher
by
kelmscott
he
asked
me
after
a
little
space
during
which
he
took
off
the
remnant
of
the
worm
and
replaced
it
by
a
large
new
one
whether
when
i
said
peace
i
did
not
really
mean
harmony
at
this
phrase
a
suspicion
rose
in
my
mind
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
knew
the
school
that
had
bred
him
and
that
he
and
i
should
be
acquainted
so
i
was
appeased
and
told
him
i
did
not
mean
harmony
for
harmony
suggested
that
we
had
to
suit
ourselves
to
the
things
around
us
or
to
get
suited
to
them
i
told
him
what
i
was
after
was
no
such
german
business
but
something
which
was
fruition
and
more
than
fruition
full
power
to
create
and
at
the
same
time
to
enjoy
a
of
new
delight
and
of
memory
of
growth
and
yet
of
foreknowledge
and
an
increasing
reverence
that
should
be
increasingly
upstanding
and
high
hatred
as
well
as
high
love
justified
for
surely
this
peace
is
not
a
lessening
into
which
we
sink
but
an
enlargement
which
we
merit
and
into
which
we
rise
and
enter
and
this
i
ended
i
am
determined
to
obtain
before
i
get
to
bablock
hythe
he
shook
his
head
determinedly
and
said
my
quest
was
hopeless
sir
said
i
are
you
acquainted
with
the
use
of
sarum
i
have
read
it
he
said
but
i
do
not
remember
it
well
then
indeed
indeed
i
knew
that
he
was
of
my
own
university
and
of
my
own
college
and
my
heart
warmed
to
him
as
i
continued
it
is
in
latin
but
after
all
that
was
the
custom
of
the
time
latin
he
answered
was
in
the
middle
ages
a
universal
tongue
do
you
know
said
i
that
passage
which
begins
pacem
at
this
moment
the
float
which
i
had
almost
forgotten
but
which
he
in
the
course
of
our
speeches
had
more
and
more
remembered
began
to
bob
up
and
down
violently
and
if
i
may
so
express
myself
the
philosopher
in
him
was
suddenly
swamped
by
the
fisherman
he
struck
with
the
zeal
and
accuracy
of
a
conqueror
he
did
something
dexterous
with
his
rod
flourished
the
line
and
landed
a
magnificent
ah
there
the
whole
story
fails
for
what
on
earth
was
the
fish
had
it
been
a
pike
or
a
trout
i
could
have
told
it
for
i
am
well
acquainted
with
both
but
this
fish
was
to
me
as
a
human
being
is
to
a
politician
this
fish
was
to
me
unknown
on
a
hermit
whom
i
knew
in
a
valley
of
the
apennines
a
little
before
it
was
day
i
went
down
by
the
side
of
a
torrent
wondering
where
i
should
find
repose
for
it
was
now
some
hours
since
i
had
given
up
all
hope
of
discovering
a
place
for
proper
human
rest
and
for
the
passing
of
the
night
but
at
least
i
hoped
to
light
upon
a
dry
bed
of
sand
under
some
overhanging
rock
or
possibly
of
pine
needles
beneath
closely
woven
trees
where
one
might
get
sleep
until
the
rising
of
the
sun
as
i
still
trudged
half
expectant
and
half
careless
a
man
came
up
behind
me
walking
quickly
as
do
mountain
men
for
throughout
the
world
i
can
not
tell
why
i
have
noticed
that
the
men
of
the
mountains
walk
quickly
and
in
a
sprightly
manner
arching
the
foot
and
with
a
light
and
general
gait
as
though
the
hills
were
waves
and
as
though
they
were
in
thought
springing
upon
the
crests
of
them
this
is
true
of
all
mountaineers
they
are
but
few
this
man
i
say
came
up
behind
me
and
asked
me
whether
i
were
going
towards
a
certain
town
of
which
he
gave
me
the
name
but
as
i
had
not
so
much
as
heard
of
this
town
i
told
him
i
knew
nothing
of
it
i
had
no
map
for
there
was
no
good
map
of
that
district
and
a
bad
map
is
worse
than
none
i
knew
the
names
of
no
towns
except
the
large
towns
on
the
coast
so
i
said
to
him
i
can
not
tell
anything
about
this
town
i
am
not
making
towards
it
but
i
desire
to
reach
the
sea
coast
which
i
know
to
be
many
hours
away
and
i
had
hoped
to
sleep
overnight
under
some
roof
or
at
least
in
some
cavern
and
to
start
with
the
early
morning
but
here
i
am
at
the
end
of
the
night
without
repose
and
wondering
whether
i
can
go
on
he
answered
me
it
is
four
hours
to
the
sea
coast
but
before
you
reach
it
you
will
find
a
lane
branching
to
the
right
and
if
you
will
go
up
it
for
it
climbs
the
hill
you
will
find
a
hermitage
now
by
the
time
you
are
there
the
hermit
will
be
risen
will
he
be
at
his
prayers
said
i
he
says
no
prayers
to
my
knowledge
said
my
companion
lightly
for
he
is
not
a
hermit
of
that
kind
hermits
are
many
and
prayers
are
few
but
you
will
find
him
bustling
about
and
he
is
a
very
hospitable
man
now
as
it
so
happens
that
the
road
to
the
sea
coast
bends
here
round
along
the
foot
of
the
hills
you
will
in
his
company
perceive
the
port
below
you
and
the
populace
and
the
high
road
and
yet
you
will
be
saving
a
good
hour
in
distance
of
time
and
will
have
ample
rest
before
reaching
your
vessel
if
it
is
a
vessel
indeed
that
you
intend
to
take
when
he
had
said
these
things
i
thanked
him
and
gave
him
a
bit
of
sausage
and
went
along
my
way
for
as
he
had
walked
faster
than
me
before
our
meeting
and
while
i
was
still
in
the
dumps
so
now
i
walked
faster
than
him
having
received
good
news
all
happened
just
as
he
had
described
the
dawn
broke
behind
me
over
the
noble
but
sedate
peaks
of
the
apennines
it
first
defined
the
heights
against
the
growing
colours
of
the
sun
it
next
produced
a
general
warmth
and
geniality
in
the
air
about
me
it
last
displayed
the
downward
opening
of
the
valley
and
very
far
off
a
plain
that
sloped
towards
the
sea
invigorated
by
the
new
presence
of
the
day
i
went
forward
more
rapidly
and
came
at
last
to
a
place
where
a
sculptured
panel
made
out
of
marble
very
clever
and
modern
and
representing
a
mystery
marked
the
division
between
two
ways
and
i
took
the
lane
to
my
right
as
my
companion
of
the
night
hours
had
advised
me
for
perhaps
a
mile
or
a
little
more
the
lane
rose
continually
between
rough
walls
intercepted
by
high
banks
of
thorn
with
here
and
there
a
vineyard
and
as
it
rose
one
had
between
the
breaches
of
the
wall
glimpses
of
an
sea
for
as
one
rose
the
sea
became
a
broader
and
a
broader
belt
and
the
very
distant
islands
which
at
first
had
been
but
little
clouds
along
the
horizon
stood
out
and
became
parts
of
the
landscape
and
as
it
were
framed
all
the
bay
then
at
last
when
i
had
come
to
the
height
of
the
hill
to
where
it
turned
a
corner
and
ran
level
along
the
escarpment
of
the
cliffs
that
dominated
the
sea
plain
i
saw
below
me
a
considerable
stretch
of
country
between
the
fall
of
the
ground
and
the
distant
shore
and
under
the
daylight
which
was
now
full
and
clear
one
could
perceive
that
all
this
plain
was
packed
with
an
intense
cultivation
with
houses
happiness
and
men
far
off
a
little
to
the
northward
lay
the
mass
of
a
town
and
stretching
out
into
the
mediterranean
with
a
gesture
of
command
and
of
desire
were
the
new
arms
of
the
harbour
to
see
such
things
filled
me
with
a
complete
content
i
know
not
whether
it
be
the
effect
of
long
vigil
or
whether
it
be
the
effect
of
contrast
between
the
darkness
and
the
light
but
certainly
to
come
out
of
a
lonely
night
spent
on
the
mountains
down
with
the
sunlight
into
the
civilisation
of
the
plain
is
for
any
man
that
cares
to
undergo
the
suffering
and
the
consolation
as
good
as
any
experience
that
life
affords
hardly
had
i
so
conceived
the
view
before
me
when
i
became
aware
upon
my
right
of
a
sort
of
cavern
or
rather
a
little
and
carefully
minded
shrine
from
which
a
greeting
proceeded
i
turned
round
and
saw
there
a
man
of
no
great
age
and
yet
of
a
venerable
appearance
he
was
perhaps
years
old
or
possibly
a
little
less
but
he
had
let
his
hair
grow
longish
and
his
beard
was
very
ample
and
fine
it
was
he
that
had
addressed
me
he
sat
dressed
in
a
long
gown
in
a
modern
and
rather
luxurious
chair
at
a
low
long
table
of
chestnut
wood
on
which
he
had
placed
a
few
books
which
i
saw
were
in
several
languages
and
two
of
them
not
only
in
english
but
having
upon
them
the
mark
of
an
english
circulating
library
which
did
business
in
the
great
town
at
our
feet
there
was
also
upon
the
table
a
breakfast
ready
of
white
bread
and
honey
a
large
brown
two
white
cups
and
some
goat
milk
in
a
bowl
of
silver
this
meal
he
asked
me
to
share
it
is
my
custom
he
said
when
i
see
a
traveller
coming
up
my
mountain
road
to
get
out
a
cup
and
a
plate
for
him
or
if
it
is
midday
a
glass
at
evening
however
no
one
ever
comes
why
not
said
i
because
he
answered
this
lane
goes
but
a
few
yards
further
round
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
there
it
ends
in
a
precipice
the
little
platform
where
we
are
is
all
but
the
end
of
the
way
indeed
i
chose
it
upon
that
account
seeing
when
i
first
came
here
that
from
its
height
and
isolation
it
was
well
fitted
for
my
retreat
i
asked
him
how
long
ago
that
was
and
he
said
nearly
twenty
years
for
all
that
time
he
added
he
had
lived
there
going
down
into
the
plain
but
once
or
twice
in
a
season
and
having
for
his
rare
companions
those
who
brought
him
food
and
the
peasants
on
such
days
as
they
toiled
up
to
work
at
their
plots
towards
the
summit
also
from
time
to
time
a
chance
traveller
like
myself
but
these
he
said
made
but
poor
companions
for
they
were
usually
such
as
had
missed
their
way
at
the
turning
and
arrived
at
that
high
place
of
his
out
of
breath
and
angry
i
assured
him
that
this
was
not
my
case
for
a
man
had
told
me
in
the
night
how
to
find
his
hermitage
and
i
had
come
of
set
purpose
to
see
him
at
this
he
smiled
we
were
now
seated
together
at
table
eating
and
talking
so
when
i
asked
him
whether
he
had
a
reputation
for
sanctity
and
whether
the
people
brought
him
food
he
answered
with
a
little
hesitation
that
he
had
a
reputation
he
thought
for
necromancy
rather
than
anything
else
and
that
upon
this
account
it
was
not
always
easy
to
persuade
a
messenger
to
bring
him
the
books
in
french
and
english
which
he
ordered
from
below
though
these
were
innocent
enough
being
as
a
rule
novels
written
by
women
or
academicians
records
of
travel
the
classics
of
the
eighteenth
century
or
the
biographies
of
aged
statesmen
as
for
food
the
people
of
the
place
did
indeed
bring
it
to
him
but
not
as
in
an
idyll
for
courtesy
contrariwise
they
demanded
heavy
payment
and
his
chief
difficulty
was
with
bread
for
stale
bread
was
intolerable
to
him
in
the
matter
of
religion
he
would
not
say
that
he
had
none
but
rather
that
he
had
several
religions
only
at
this
season
of
the
year
when
everything
was
fresh
pleasant
and
entertaining
he
did
not
make
use
of
any
of
them
but
laid
them
all
aside
as
this
last
saying
of
his
had
no
meaning
for
me
i
turned
to
another
matter
and
said
to
him
in
any
solitude
contemplation
is
the
chief
business
of
the
soul
how
then
do
you
who
say
you
practise
no
rites
fill
up
your
loneliness
here
in
answer
to
this
question
he
became
more
animated
spoke
with
a
sort
of
laugh
in
his
voice
and
seemed
as
though
he
were
young
again
and
as
though
my
question
had
aroused
a
whole
lifetime
of
good
memories
my
contemplation
he
said
not
without
large
gestures
is
this
wide
and
prosperous
plain
below
the
great
city
with
its
harbour
and
ceaseless
traffic
of
ships
the
roads
the
houses
building
the
fields
yielding
every
year
to
husbandry
the
perpetual
activities
of
men
i
watch
my
kind
and
i
glory
in
them
too
far
off
to
be
disturbed
by
the
friction
of
individuals
yet
near
enough
to
have
a
daily
companionship
in
the
spectacle
of
so
much
life
the
mornings
when
they
are
all
at
labour
i
am
inspired
by
their
energy
in
the
noons
and
afternoons
i
feel
a
part
of
their
patient
and
vigorous
endurance
and
when
the
sun
broadens
near
the
rim
of
the
sea
at
evening
and
all
work
ceases
i
am
filled
with
their
repose
the
lights
along
the
harbour
front
in
the
twilight
and
on
into
the
darkness
remind
me
of
them
when
i
can
no
longer
see
their
crowds
and
movements
and
so
does
the
music
which
they
love
to
play
in
their
recreation
after
the
fatigues
of
the
day
and
the
distant
songs
which
they
sing
far
into
the
night
i
was
about
thirty
years
of
age
and
had
seen
in
a
career
of
diplomacy
many
places
and
men
i
had
a
fortune
quite
insufficient
for
a
life
among
my
equals
my
youth
had
been
therefore
anxious
humiliated
and
worn
when
upon
a
feverish
and
unhappy
holiday
taken
from
the
capital
of
this
state
i
came
by
accident
to
the
cave
and
platform
which
you
see
it
was
one
of
those
days
in
which
the
air
exhales
revelation
and
i
clearly
saw
that
happiness
inhabited
the
mountain
corner
i
determined
to
remain
for
ever
in
so
rare
a
companionship
and
from
that
day
she
has
never
abandoned
me
for
a
little
while
i
kept
a
touch
with
the
world
by
purchasing
those
newspapers
in
which
i
was
reported
shot
by
brigands
or
devoured
by
wild
beasts
but
the
amusement
soon
wearied
me
and
now
i
have
forgotten
the
very
names
of
my
companions
we
were
silent
then
until
i
said
but
some
day
you
will
die
here
all
alone
and
why
not
he
answered
calmly
it
will
be
a
nuisance
for
those
who
find
me
but
i
shall
be
indifferent
altogether
that
is
blasphemy
says
i
so
says
the
priest
of
anthony
he
immediately
replied
but
whether
as
a
reproach
an
argument
or
a
mere
commentary
i
could
not
discover
in
a
little
while
he
advised
me
to
go
down
to
the
plain
before
the
heat
should
incommode
my
journey
i
left
him
therefore
reading
a
book
of
jane
austen
and
i
have
never
seen
him
since
of
the
many
strange
men
i
have
met
in
my
travels
he
was
one
of
the
most
strange
and
not
the
least
fortunate
every
word
i
have
written
about
him
is
true
of
an
unknown
country
ten
years
ago
i
think
or
perhaps
a
little
less
or
perhaps
a
little
more
i
came
in
the
euston
road
that
thoroughfare
of
empire
upon
a
young
man
a
little
younger
than
myself
whom
i
knew
though
i
did
not
know
him
very
well
it
was
drizzling
and
the
booksellers
who
are
rare
in
this
thoroughfare
were
beginning
to
put
out
the
waterproof
covers
over
their
wares
this
disturbed
my
acquaintance
because
he
was
engaged
upon
buying
a
cheap
book
that
should
really
satisfy
him
now
this
was
difficult
for
he
had
no
hobby
and
the
book
which
should
satisfy
him
must
be
one
that
should
describe
or
summon
up
or
it
is
better
to
say
hint
at
or
the
theologians
would
say
reveal
or
the
platonists
would
say
the
unknown
country
which
he
thought
was
his
very
home
i
had
known
his
habit
of
seeking
such
books
for
two
years
and
had
half
wondered
at
it
and
half
sympathised
it
was
an
appetite
partly
satisfied
by
almost
any
work
that
brought
to
him
the
vision
of
a
place
in
the
mind
which
he
had
always
intensely
desired
but
to
which
as
he
had
then
long
guessed
and
as
he
is
now
quite
certain
no
human
paths
directly
lead
he
would
buy
with
avidity
travels
to
the
moon
and
to
the
planets
from
the
most
worthless
to
the
best
he
loved
utopias
and
did
not
disregard
even
so
prosaic
a
category
as
books
of
real
travel
so
long
as
by
exaggeration
or
by
a
glamour
in
the
style
they
gave
him
a
full
draught
of
that
drug
which
he
desired
whether
this
satisfaction
the
young
man
sought
was
a
satisfaction
in
illusion
i
have
used
the
word
drug
with
hesitation
or
whether
it
was
as
he
persistently
maintained
the
satisfaction
of
a
memory
or
whether
it
was
as
i
am
often
tempted
to
think
the
satisfaction
of
a
thirst
which
will
ultimately
be
quenched
in
every
human
soul
i
can
not
tell
whatever
it
was
he
sought
it
with
more
than
the
appetite
with
which
a
hungry
man
seeks
food
he
sought
it
with
something
that
was
not
hunger
but
passion
that
evening
he
found
a
book
it
is
well
known
that
men
purchase
with
difficulty
books
upon
the
stalls
and
that
in
some
mysterious
way
the
sellers
of
these
books
are
content
to
provide
a
kind
of
library
for
the
poorer
and
more
eager
of
the
public
and
a
library
admirable
in
this
that
it
is
accessible
upon
every
shelf
and
exposes
a
man
to
no
control
except
that
he
must
not
steal
and
even
in
this
it
is
nothing
but
the
force
of
public
law
that
interferes
my
friend
therefore
would
in
the
natural
course
of
things
have
dipped
into
the
book
and
left
it
there
but
a
better
luck
persuaded
him
whether
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
rain
or
a
sudden
loneliness
in
such
terrible
weather
and
in
such
a
terrible
town
compelling
him
to
seek
a
more
permanent
companionship
with
another
mind
or
whether
it
was
my
sudden
arrival
and
shame
lest
his
poverty
should
appear
in
his
refusing
to
buy
the
book
whatever
it
was
he
bought
that
same
and
since
he
bought
the
book
i
also
have
known
it
and
have
found
in
it
as
he
did
the
most
complete
expression
that
i
know
of
the
unknown
country
of
which
he
was
a
citizen
oddly
a
citizen
as
i
then
thought
wisely
as
i
now
conceive
all
that
can
best
be
expressed
in
words
should
be
expressed
in
verse
but
verse
is
a
slow
thing
to
create
nay
it
is
not
really
created
it
is
a
secretion
of
the
mind
it
is
a
pearl
that
gathers
round
some
irritant
and
slowly
expresses
the
very
essence
of
beauty
and
of
desire
that
has
lain
long
potential
and
unexpressed
in
the
mind
of
the
man
who
secretes
it
god
knows
that
this
unknown
country
has
been
hit
off
in
verse
a
hundred
times
if
i
were
perfectly
sure
of
my
accents
i
would
quote
two
lines
from
the
odyssey
in
which
the
unknown
country
stands
out
as
clear
as
does
a
sudden
vision
from
a
mountain
ridge
when
the
mist
lifts
after
a
long
climb
and
one
sees
beneath
one
an
unexpected
and
glorious
land
such
a
vision
as
greets
a
man
when
he
comes
over
the
saldeu
into
the
simple
and
secluded
republic
of
the
andorrans
then
again
the
germans
in
their
idioms
have
flashed
it
out
i
am
assured
for
i
remember
a
woman
telling
me
that
there
was
a
song
by
schiller
which
exactly
gave
the
revelation
of
which
i
speak
in
english
thank
heaven
emotion
of
this
kind
emotion
necessary
to
the
life
of
the
soul
is
very
abundantly
furnished
as
who
does
not
know
the
lines
blessed
with
that
which
is
not
in
the
word
of
man
nor
his
conception
blessed
land
then
there
is
also
the
whole
group
of
glimpses
which
shakespeare
amused
himself
by
scattering
as
might
a
man
who
had
a
great
oak
chest
full
of
jewels
and
who
now
and
then
out
of
kindly
fun
poured
out
a
handful
and
gave
them
to
his
guests
i
quote
from
memory
but
i
think
certain
of
the
lines
run
more
or
less
like
this
look
how
the
dawn
in
russet
mantle
clad
stands
on
the
steep
of
yon
high
eastern
hill
and
again
night
candles
are
burnt
out
and
jocund
day
stands
tiptoe
on
the
misty
mountain
tops
which
moves
me
to
digress
how
on
earth
did
any
living
man
pull
it
off
as
well
as
that
i
remember
arguing
with
a
man
who
very
genuinely
thought
the
talent
of
shakespeare
was
exaggerated
in
public
opinion
and
discovering
at
the
end
of
a
long
wrangle
that
he
was
not
considering
shakespeare
as
a
poet
but
as
a
poet
then
how
on
earth
did
he
manage
it
keats
did
it
continually
especially
in
the
milton
does
it
so
well
in
the
fourth
book
of
that
i
defy
any
man
of
a
sane
understanding
to
read
the
whole
of
that
book
before
going
to
bed
and
not
to
wake
up
next
morning
as
though
he
had
been
on
a
journey
william
morris
does
it
especially
in
the
verses
about
a
prayer
over
the
corn
and
as
for
virgil
the
poet
virgil
he
does
it
continually
like
a
man
whose
very
trade
it
is
who
does
not
remember
the
swimmer
who
saw
italy
from
the
top
of
the
wave
here
also
let
me
digress
how
do
the
poets
do
it
i
do
not
mean
where
do
they
get
their
power
as
i
was
asking
just
now
of
shakespeare
but
how
do
the
words
simple
or
complex
produce
that
effect
very
often
there
is
not
any
adjective
sometimes
not
any
qualification
at
all
often
only
one
subject
with
its
predicate
and
its
statement
and
its
object
there
is
never
any
detail
of
description
but
the
scene
rises
more
vivid
in
colour
more
exact
in
outline
more
wonderful
in
influence
than
anything
we
can
see
with
our
eyes
except
perhaps
those
things
we
see
in
the
few
moments
of
intense
emotion
which
come
to
us
we
know
not
whence
and
expand
out
into
completion
and
into
manhood
catullus
does
it
he
does
it
so
powerfully
in
the
opening
lines
of
that
a
man
reads
the
first
couplet
of
that
hymeneal
and
immediately
perceives
the
apennines
the
nameless
translator
of
the
highland
song
does
it
especially
when
he
advances
that
battering
line
and
we
in
dreams
behold
the
hebrides
they
all
do
it
bless
their
hearts
the
poets
which
leads
me
back
again
to
the
mournful
reflection
that
it
can
not
be
done
in
prose
little
friends
my
readers
i
wish
it
could
be
done
in
prose
for
if
it
could
and
if
i
knew
how
to
do
it
i
would
here
present
to
you
that
unknown
country
in
such
a
fashion
that
every
landscape
which
you
should
see
henceforth
would
be
transformed
by
the
appearing
through
it
the
shining
and
uplifting
through
it
of
the
unknown
country
upon
which
reposes
this
tedious
and
repetitive
world
now
you
may
say
to
me
that
prose
can
do
it
and
you
may
quote
to
me
the
end
of
the
a
very
remarkable
piece
of
writing
or
better
still
as
we
shall
be
more
agreed
upon
it
the
general
impression
left
upon
the
mind
by
the
book
which
set
me
writing
hudson
i
do
not
deny
that
prose
can
do
it
but
when
it
does
it
it
is
hardly
to
be
called
prose
for
it
is
inspired
note
carefully
the
passages
in
which
the
trick
is
worked
in
prose
for
instance
in
the
story
of
ruth
in
the
bible
where
it
is
done
with
complete
success
you
will
perceive
an
incantation
and
a
spell
indeed
this
same
episode
of
ruth
in
exile
has
inspired
two
splendid
passages
of
european
verse
of
which
it
is
difficult
to
say
which
is
the
more
national
and
therefore
the
greatest
victor
hugo
in
the
des
or
astounding
four
lines
there
was
a
shepherd
the
other
day
up
at
findon
fair
who
had
come
from
the
east
by
lewes
with
sheep
and
who
had
in
his
eyes
that
reminiscence
of
horizons
which
makes
the
eyes
of
shepherds
and
of
mountaineers
different
from
the
eyes
of
other
men
he
was
occupied
when
i
came
upon
him
in
pulling
fulton
sheep
by
one
hind
leg
so
that
they
should
go
the
way
they
were
desired
to
go
it
happened
that
day
that
fulton
sheep
were
not
sold
and
the
shepherd
went
driving
them
back
through
findon
village
and
up
on
to
the
high
downs
i
went
with
him
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
for
shepherds
talk
quite
differently
from
other
men
and
when
we
came
on
to
the
shoulder
of
chanctonbury
and
looked
down
upon
the
weald
which
stretched
out
like
the
plains
of
heaven
he
said
to
me
i
never
come
here
but
it
seems
like
a
different
place
down
below
and
as
though
it
were
not
the
place
where
i
have
gone
afoot
with
sheep
under
the
hills
it
seems
different
when
you
are
looking
down
at
it
he
added
that
he
had
never
known
why
then
i
knew
that
he
like
myself
was
perpetually
in
perception
of
the
unknown
country
and
i
was
very
pleased
but
we
did
not
say
anything
more
to
each
other
about
it
until
we
got
down
into
steyning
there
we
drank
together
and
we
still
said
nothing
more
about
it
so
that
to
this
day
all
we
know
of
the
matter
is
what
we
knew
when
we
started
and
what
you
knew
when
i
began
to
write
this
and
what
you
are
now
no
further
informed
upon
namely
that
there
is
an
unknown
country
lying
beneath
the
places
that
we
know
and
appearing
only
in
moments
of
revelation
whether
we
shall
reach
this
country
at
last
or
whether
we
shall
not
it
is
impossible
to
determine
on
a
faery
castle
a
woman
whose
presence
in
english
letters
will
continue
to
increase
wrote
of
a
cause
to
which
she
had
dedicated
her
life
that
it
was
like
that
faery
castle
of
which
men
became
aware
when
they
wandered
upon
a
certain
moor
in
that
deserted
place
the
picture
was
taken
from
the
writings
of
sir
walter
scott
the
lonely
traveller
heard
above
him
a
noise
of
bugles
in
the
air
and
thus
a
faery
castle
was
revealed
but
again
when
the
traveller
would
reach
it
a
doom
comes
upon
him
and
in
the
act
of
its
attainment
it
vanishes
away
we
are
northern
full
of
dreams
in
the
darkness
this
castle
is
caught
in
glimpses
a
misty
thing
it
is
seen
a
moment
then
it
mixes
once
again
with
the
mist
of
our
northern
air
and
when
that
mist
has
lifted
from
the
heath
there
is
nothing
before
the
watcher
but
a
bare
upland
open
to
the
wind
and
roofed
only
by
hurrying
cloud
yet
in
the
moment
of
revelation
most
certainly
the
traveller
perceived
it
and
the
call
of
its
was
very
clear
he
continues
his
way
perceiving
only
the
things
he
knows
trees
bent
by
the
gale
rude
heather
the
gravel
of
the
path
and
mountains
all
around
in
that
landscape
he
has
no
companion
yet
he
can
not
but
be
haunted
as
he
goes
by
towers
upon
which
he
surely
looked
and
by
the
sharp
memory
of
that
still
seem
to
startle
his
hearing
in
our
legends
of
western
europe
this
castle
perpetually
returns
it
has
been
seen
not
only
on
the
highlands
of
ireland
of
wales
of
brittany
of
the
asturias
of
normandy
and
of
auvergne
but
in
the
plains
also
and
on
those
river
meadows
where
wealth
comes
so
fast
that
even
simple
men
early
forget
the
visions
of
the
hills
the
imagination
or
rather
the
speech
of
our
race
has
created
or
recognised
throughout
our
territory
this
stronghold
which
was
not
altogether
of
the
world

as
she
sat
with
tristan
in
a
castle
garden
towards
the
end
of
a
summer
night
whispered
to
him
tristan
they
say
that
this
castle
is
faÃ«ry
it
is
revealed
at
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
but
presently
it
vanishes
away
and
as
she
said
it
the
bugles
rang
dawn
raymond
of
saragossa
saw
this
castle
also
as
he
came
down
from
the
wooded
hills
after
he
had
found
the
water
of
life
and
was
bearing
it
towards
the
plain
he
saw
the
towers
quite
clearly
and
also
thought
he
heard
the
call
upon
that
downward
road
at
whose
end
he
was
to
meet
with
bramimonde
but
he
saw
it
thence
only
in
the
exaltation
of
the
summits
as
he
looked
over
the
falling
forest
to
the
plain
and
the
sierra
miles
beyond
he
saw
it
thence
only
never
after
upon
either
bank
of
ebro
could
he
come
upon
it
nor
could
any
man
assure
him
of
the
way
in
the
story
of
hugh
the
fortinbras
out
of
the
cotentin
had
a
castle
of
this
kind
for
when
after
the
battle
they
count
the
dead
the
priest
finds
in
the
among
other
bodies
that
of
this
old
lord
and
hugh
that
trusted
in
his
glass
but
rode
not
home
the
day
whose
title
was
the
fortinbras
with
the
lords
of
his
array
this
was
that
old
hugh
the
fortinbras
who
had
been
lord
to
the
priest
father
so
that
when
the
battle
was
engaged
the
priest
watched
him
from
the
opposing
rank
and
saw
him
fall
far
off
just
as
the
line
broke
and
before
the
men
of
the
caux
country
had
room
to
charge
it
was
easy
to
see
him
for
he
rode
a
high
horse
and
was
taller
than
other
normans
and
when
his
horse
was
wounded
the
girth
severed
and
the
saddle
swung
and
he
went
down
he
never
more
sang
winter
songs
in
his
high
town
in
his
high
town
that
faery
is
and
stands
on
harcourt
lea
to
summon
him
up
his
his
writ
beyond
the
mountain
ran
my
father
was
his
although
the
farm
was
free
before
the
angry
wars
began
he
was
a
friend
to
me
in
his
high
town
that
faery
is
and
stands
on
harcourt
bay
the
fisher
driving
through
the
night
makes
harbour
by
that
castle
height
and
moors
him
till
the
day
but
with
the
broadening
of
the
light
it
vanishes
away
so
the
faery
castle
comes
in
by
an
illusion
in
the
ballad
of
the
battle
of
what
is
this
vision
which
our
race
has
so
symbolised
or
so
seen
and
to
which
are
thus
attached
its
oldest
memories
it
is
the
miraculous
moment
of
intense
emotion
in
which
whether
we
are
duped
or
transfigured
we
are
in
touch
with
a
reality
firmer
than
the
reality
of
this
world
the
faery
castle
is
the
counterpart
and
the
example
of
those
glimpses
which
every
man
has
enjoyed
especially
in
youth
and
which
no
man
even
in
the
dust
of
middle
age
can
quite
forget
in
these
were
found
a
complete
harmony
and
satisfaction
which
were
not
negative
nor
dependent
upon
the
absence
of
discord
such
completion
as
criticism
may
conceive
but
as
positive
as
colour
or
as
music
and
clothed
as
it
were
in
a
living
body
of
joy
the
vision
may
be
unreal
or
real
in
either
case
it
is
valid
if
it
is
unreal
it
is
a
symbol
of
the
world
behind
the
world
but
it
is
no
less
a
symbol
even
if
it
is
unreal
it
is
a
sudden
seeing
of
the
place
to
which
our
faces
are
set
during
this
unbroken
marching
of
years
once
on
the
sacramento
river
a
little
before
sunrise
i
looked
eastward
from
a
boat
and
saw
along
the
dawn
the
black
edge
of
the
sierras
the
peaks
were
as
sharp
as
are
the
malvern
from
the
cotswold
though
they
were
days
and
days
away
they
made
a
broad
jagged
band
intensely
black
against
the
glow
of
the
sky
i
drew
them
so
a
tiny
corner
of
the
sun
appeared
between
two
central
peaks
at
once
the
whole
range
was
suffused
with
glory
the
sun
was
wholly
risen
and
the
mountains
had
completely
disappeared
in
the
place
where
they
had
been
was
the
sky
of
the
horizon
at
another
time
also
in
a
boat
i
saw
beyond
a
spit
of
the
tunisian
coast
as
it
seemed
a
flat
island
through
the
heat
with
which
the
air
trembled
was
a
low
gleam
of
sand
a
palm
or
two
and
less
certainly
the
flats
and
domes
of
a
white
native
village
our
course
which
was
to
round
the
point
went
straight
for
this
island
and
as
we
approached
it
became
first
doubtful
then
flickering
then
a
play
of
light
upon
the
waves
it
was
a
mirage
and
it
had
melted
into
the
air
there
is
a
part
of
us
as
all
the
world
knows
which
is
immixed
with
change
and
by
change
only
can
live
there
is
another
part
which
lies
behind
motion
and
time
and
that
part
is
ourselves
this
diviner
part
has
surely
a
stronghold
which
is
also
an
inheritance
it
has
a
home
which
perhaps
it
remembers
and
which
certainly
it
conceives
at
rare
moments
during
our
path
over
the
moor
this
is
that
faÃ«ry
castle
it
is
revealed
at
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
we
turn
our
eyes
we
glance
and
we
perceive
it
we
strain
to
reach
it
in
the
very
effort
of
our
going
the
doom
of
human
labour
falls
upon
us
and
it
vanishes
away
it
is
real
or
unreal
it
is
unreal
like
that
island
which
i
thought
to
see
some
miles
from
africa
but
which
was
not
truly
there
for
the
ship
when
it
came
to
the
place
that
island
had
occupied
sailed
easily
over
an
empty
sea
it
is
real
like
those
high
sierras
which
i
drew
from
the
sacramento
river
at
the
turn
of
the
night
and
which
were
suddenly
obliterated
by
the
rising
sun
where
the
vision
is
but
mirage
even
there
it
is
a
symbol
of
our
goal
where
it
stands
fast
and
true
for
however
brief
a
moment
it
can
illumine
and
should
determine
the
whole
of
our
lives
for
such
sights
are
the
manifestation
of
that
glory
which
lies
permanent
beyond
the
changing
of
the
world
of
such
a
sort
are
the
young
passionate
intentions
to
relieve
the
burden
of
mankind
first
love
the
mood
created
by
certain
strains
of
music
and
as
i
am
willing
to
believe
the
walls
of
heaven
on
a
southern
harbour
the
ship
had
sailed
northward
in
an
even
manner
and
under
a
sky
that
was
full
of
stars
when
the
dawn
broke
and
the
full
day
quickly
broadened
over
the
mediterranean
with
the
advent
of
the
light
the
salt
of
the
sea
seemed
stronger
and
there
certainly
arose
a
new
freshness
in
the
following
air
but
as
yet
no
land
appeared
until
at
last
seated
as
i
was
alone
in
the
fore
part
of
the
vessel
i
clearly
saw
a
small
unchanging
shape
far
off
before
me
peaked
upon
the
horizon
and
grey
like
a
cloud
this
i
watched
wondering
what
its
name
might
be
who
lived
upon
it
or
what
its
fame
was
for
it
was
certainly
land
i
watched
in
this
manner
for
some
hours
perhaps
for
two
when
the
island
now
grown
higher
was
so
near
that
i
could
see
trees
upon
it
but
they
were
set
sparsely
as
trees
are
on
a
dry
land
and
most
of
them
seemed
to
be
thorn
trees
it
was
at
this
moment
that
a
man
who
had
been
singing
to
himself
in
a
low
tone
aft
came
up
to
me
and
told
me
that
this
island
was
called
the
island
of
goats
and
that
there
were
no
men
upon
it
to
his
knowledge
that
it
was
a
lonely
place
and
worth
little
but
by
this
time
there
had
risen
beyond
the
island
of
goats
another
and
much
larger
land
it
lay
all
along
the
north
in
a
mountainous
belt
of
blue
and
any
man
coming
to
it
for
the
first
time
or
unacquainted
with
maps
would
have
said
to
himself
i
have
found
a
considerable
place
and
indeed
the
name
of
the
island
indicates
this
for
it
is
called
majorca
the
larger
land
towards
this
past
the
island
of
goats
and
past
the
strait
we
continued
to
sail
with
a
light
breeze
for
hours
until
at
last
we
could
see
on
this
shore
also
sparse
trees
but
most
of
them
were
olive
trees
and
they
were
relieved
with
the
green
of
cultivation
up
the
high
mountain
sides
and
with
the
white
houses
of
men
the
deck
was
now
crowded
with
people
most
of
whom
were
coming
back
to
their
own
country
after
an
exile
in
africa
among
and
dangerous
things
the
little
children
who
had
not
yet
known
europe
having
been
born
beyond
the
sea
were
full
of
wonder
but
their
parents
who
knew
the
shortness
of
human
life
and
its
trouble
were
happy
because
they
had
come
back
at
last
and
saw
before
them
the
known
jetties
and
the
familiar
hills
of
home
as
i
was
surrounded
by
so
much
happiness
i
myself
felt
as
though
i
had
come
to
the
end
of
a
long
journey
and
was
reaching
my
own
place
though
i
was
in
reality
bound
for
barcelona
and
after
that
up
northward
through
the
cerdagne
and
after
that
to
perigord
and
after
that
to
the
channel
and
so
to
sussex
where
all
journeys
end
the
harbour
had
about
it
that
which
everywhere
in
the
mediterranean
distinguishes
harbours
it
was
as
though
the
men
of
that
sea
had
said
it
never
blows
for
long
let
us
build
ourselves
a
rough
refuge
and
sail
away
we
neared
this
harbour
but
we
flew
no
flag
and
made
no
signal
beneath
us
the
water
was
so
clear
that
all
one
need
have
done
to
have
brought
the
vessel
in
if
one
had
not
known
the
channel
would
have
been
to
lean
over
the
side
and
to
keep
the
boy
at
the
helm
off
the
very
evident
shallows
and
the
crusted
rocks
by
gestures
of
hands
for
the
fairway
was
like
a
trench
deep
and
blue
so
we
slid
into
palma
haven
and
as
we
rounded
the
pier
the
light
wind
took
us
first
abeam
and
then
forward
then
we
let
go
and
she
swung
up
and
was
still
they
lowered
the
sails
the
people
who
were
returning
were
so
full
of
activity
and
joy
that
it
was
like
a
hive
of
bees
but
i
no
longer
felt
this
as
i
had
felt
their
earlier
and
more
subdued
emotion
for
the
place
was
no
longer
distant
or
mysterious
as
it
had
been
when
first
its
sons
and
daughters
had
come
up
on
deck
to
welcome
it
and
had
given
me
part
of
their
delight
it
was
now
an
evident
and
noisy
town
hot
violent
and
strong
the
houses
had
about
them
a
certain
splendour
the
citizens
upon
the
quays
a
satisfied
and
prosperous
look
its
streets
where
they
ran
down
towards
the
sea
were
charmingly
clean
and
cared
for
and
the
architecture
of
its
wealthier
mansions
seemed
to
me
at
once
unusual
and
beautiful
for
i
had
not
yet
seen
spain
each
house
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
from
the
water
was
entered
by
a
fine
sculptured
porch
which
gave
into
a
cool
courtyard
with
arcades
under
it
and
most
of
the
larger
houses
had
escutcheons
carved
in
stone
upon
their
walls
but
what
most
pleased
me
and
also
seemed
most
strange
was
to
see
against
the
east
a
vast
cathedral
quite
northern
in
outline
except
for
a
severity
and
discipline
of
which
the
north
is
incapable
save
when
it
has
steeped
itself
in
the
terseness
of
the
classics
this
monument
was
far
larger
than
anything
in
the
town
it
stood
out
separate
from
the
town
and
dominated
it
upon
its
seaward
side
somewhat
as
might
an
isolated
hill
a
shore
fortress
of
rock
it
was
almost
bare
of
ornament
its
stones
were
very
carefully
worked
and
closely
fitted
and
little
waves
broke
ceaselessly
along
the
base
of
its
rampart
landwards
a
mass
of
low
houses
which
seemed
to
touch
the
body
of
the
building
did
but
emphasise
its
height
when
i
had
landed
i
made
at
once
for
this
cathedral
and
with
every
step
it
grew
greater
we
who
are
of
the
north
are
accustomed
to
the
enormous
we
have
unearthly
sunsets
and
the
clouds
magnify
our
hills
the
southern
men
see
nothing
but
misproportion
in
what
is
enormous
they
love
to
have
things
in
order
and
violence
in
art
is
odious
to
them
this
high
and
dreadful
roof
had
not
been
raised
under
the
influences
of
the
island
it
had
surely
been
designed
just
after
the
from
the
mohammedans
when
a
turbulent
army
not
only
of
gascons
and
catalans
but
of
normans
also
and
of
frisians
and
of
rhenish
men
had
poured
across
the
water
and
had
stormed
the
on
this
account
the
cathedral
had
about
it
in
its
and
in
its
immensity
and
in
the
gothic
point
of
its
windows
a
northern
air
but
in
its
austerity
and
in
its
magnificence
it
was
spaniard
as
i
passed
the
little
porch
of
entry
in
the
side
wall
i
saw
a
man
he
was
standing
silent
and
alone
he
was
not
blind
and
perhaps
not
poor
and
as
i
passed
he
begged
the
charity
not
of
money
but
of
prayers
when
i
had
entered
the
cool
and
darkness
of
the
nave
his
figure
still
remained
in
my
mind
and
i
could
not
forget
it
i
remembered
the
straw
hat
upon
his
head
and
the
suit
of
blue
canvas
which
he
wore
and
the
rough
staff
of
wood
in
his
hand
i
was
especially
haunted
by
his
expression
which
was
patient
and
masqued
as
though
he
were
enduring
a
pain
and
chose
to
hide
it
the
nave
was
empty
it
was
a
great
hollow
that
echoed
and
there
were
no
shrines
and
no
lamps
and
no
men
or
women
praying
and
therefore
the
figure
at
the
door
filled
my
mind
more
and
more
until
i
went
out
and
asked
him
if
he
was
in
need
of
money
of
which
at
that
moment
i
had
none
he
answered
that
his
need
was
not
for
money
but
only
for
prayers
why
said
i
do
you
need
prayers
he
said
it
was
because
his
fate
was
upon
him
i
think
he
spoke
the
truth
he
was
standing
erect
and
with
dignity
his
eyes
were
not
disturbed
and
he
repeatedly
refused
the
alms
of
no
one
said
i
should
yield
to
these
moods
he
answered
nothing
but
looked
pensive
like
a
man
gazing
at
a
landscape
and
remembering
his
life
but
it
was
now
the
hour
when
the
ship
was
to
be
sailing
again
and
i
could
not
linger
though
i
wished
very
much
to
talk
more
with
him
i
begged
him
to
name
a
shrine
where
a
gift
might
be
of
especial
value
to
him
he
said
that
he
was
attached
to
no
one
shrine
more
than
to
any
other
and
then
i
went
away
regretfully
remembering
how
earnestly
he
had
asked
for
prayers
this
was
in
palma
of
majorca
not
two
years
ago
there
are
many
such
men
but
few
who
speak
so
humbly
when
i
had
got
aboard
again
the
ship
sailed
out
and
rounded
a
lighthouse
point
and
then
made
north
to
barcelona
the
night
fell
and
next
morning
there
rose
before
us
the
winged
figures
that
crown
the
custom
house
of
that
port
and
are
an
introduction
to
the
glories
of
spain
on
a
young
man
and
an
older
man
a
young
man
of
my
acquaintance
having
passed
his
birthday
and
wrongly
imagining
this
date
to
represent
the
grand
climacteric
went
by
night
in
some
perturbation
to
an
older
man
and
spoke
to
him
as
follows
sir
i
have
intruded
upon
your
leisure
in
order
to
ask
your
advice
upon
certain
matters
the
older
man
whose
thoughts
were
at
that
moment
intently
set
upon
money
looked
up
in
a
startled
way
and
attempted
to
excuse
himself
suffering
as
he
did
from
the
delusion
that
the
young
man
was
after
a
loan
but
the
young
man
whose
mind
was
miles
away
from
all
such
trifling
things
continued
to
press
him
anxiously
without
so
much
as
noticing
that
he
had
perturbed
his
senior
i
have
come
sir
said
he
to
ask
your
opinion
advice
experience
and
guidance
upon
something
very
serious
which
has
entered
into
my
life
which
is
briefly
that
i
feel
myself
to
be
growing
old
upon
hearing
this
so
comforting
and
so
reasonable
a
statement
the
older
man
heaved
a
profound
sigh
of
relief
and
turning
to
him
a
mature
and
smiling
visage
as
also
turning
towards
him
his
person
and
in
so
doing
turning
his
polished
american
hickory
wood
office
chair
answered
with
a
peculiar
refinement
but
not
without
sadness
i
shall
be
happy
to
be
of
any
use
i
can
from
which
order
and
choice
of
words
the
reader
might
imagine
that
the
older
man
was
himself
a
colonial
like
his
chair
in
this
imagination
the
reader
should
he
entertain
it
would
be
deceived
the
younger
man
then
proceeded
knotting
his
forehead
and
putting
into
his
eyes
that
troubled
look
which
is
proper
to
virtue
and
to
youth
oh
sir
i
can
not
tell
you
how
things
seem
to
be
slipping
from
me
i
smell
less
keenly
and
taste
less
keenly
i
enjoy
less
keenly
and
suffer
less
keenly
than
i
did
of
many
things
which
i
certainly
desired
i
can
only
say
that
i
now
desire
them
in
a
more
confused
manner
of
certain
propositions
in
which
i
intensely
believed
i
can
only
say
that
i
now
see
them
interfered
with
and
criticised
perpetually
not
as
was
formerly
the
case
by
my
enemies
but
by
the
plain
observance
of
life
and
what
is
worse
i
find
growing
in
me
a
habit
of
reflection
for
reflection
sake
leading
nowhere
and
a
sort
of
sedentary
attitude
in
which
i
watch
but
neither
judge
nor
support
nor
attack
any
portion
of
mankind
the
older
man
hearing
this
speech
congratulated
his
visitor
upon
his
terse
and
accurate
methods
of
expression
detailed
to
him
the
careers
in
which
such
habits
of
terminology
are
valuable
and
also
those
in
which
they
are
a
fatal
fault
having
heard
you
he
said
it
is
my
advice
to
you
drawn
from
a
long
experience
of
men
to
enter
the
legal
profession
and
having
entered
it
to
supplement
your
income
with
writing
occasional
articles
for
the
more
dignified
organs
of
the
press
but
if
this
prospect
does
not
attract
you
and
indeed
there
are
many
whom
it
has
repelled
i
would
offer
you
as
an
alternative
that
you
should
produce
slowly
at
about
the
rate
of
one
in
every
two
years
short
books
compact
of
irony
yet
having
running
through
them
like
a
twisted
thread
up
and
down
emerging
hidden
and
in
the
stuff
of
your
writing
a
memory
of
those
early
certitudes
and
even
of
passion
for
those
earlier
revelations
when
the
older
man
had
said
this
he
sat
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
then
added
gravely
but
i
must
warn
you
that
for
such
a
career
you
need
an
accumulated
capital
of
at
least
the
young
man
was
not
comforted
by
advice
of
this
sort
and
was
determined
to
make
a
kind
of
war
upon
the
doctrine
which
seemed
to
underlie
it
he
said
in
effect
that
if
he
could
not
be
restored
to
the
pristine
condition
which
he
felt
to
be
slipping
from
him
he
would
as
lief
stop
living
on
hearing
this
second
statement
the
older
man
became
extremely
grave
young
man
said
he
young
man
consider
well
what
you
are
saying
the
poet
shakespeare
in
his
most
remarkable
effort
which
i
need
hardly
tell
you
is
the
tragedy
of
or
the
prince
of
denmark
has
remarked
that
the
thousand
doors
of
death
stand
open
i
may
be
misquoting
the
words
and
if
i
am
i
do
so
boldly
and
without
fear
for
any
fool
with
a
book
at
his
elbow
can
get
the
words
right
and
yet
not
understand
their
meaning
let
me
assure
you
that
the
doors
of
death
are
not
so
simply
hinged
and
that
any
determination
to
force
them
involves
the
destruction
of
much
more
than
these
light
though
divine
memories
of
which
you
speak
they
involve
indeed
the
destruction
of
the
very
soul
which
conceives
them
and
let
me
assure
you
not
upon
my
own
experience
but
upon
that
of
those
who
have
drowned
themselves
imperfectly
who
have
enlisted
in
really
dangerous
wars
or
who
have
fired
revolvers
at
themselves
in
a
twisted
fashion
with
their
right
hands
that
quite
apart
from
that
evil
to
the
soul
of
which
i
speak
the
evil
to
the
mere
body
in
such
experiments
is
so
considerable
that
a
man
would
rather
go
to
the
dentist
than
experience
them
you
will
forgive
me
he
added
earnestly
for
speaking
in
this
gay
manner
upon
an
important
philosophical
subject
but
long
hours
of
work
at
the
earning
of
my
living
force
me
to
some
relaxation
towards
the
end
of
the
day
and
i
can
not
restrain
a
frivolous
spirit
even
in
the
discussion
of
such
fundamental
things
no
do
not
as
you
put
it
living
it
hurts
and
no
one
has
the
least
conception
of
whether
it
is
a
remedy
what
is
more
the
life
in
front
of
you
will
prove
after
a
few
years
as
entertaining
as
the
life
which
you
are
rapidly
leaving
the
young
man
caught
on
to
this
last
phrase
and
said
what
do
you
mean
by
i
intend
said
the
older
man
to
keep
my
advice
to
you
in
the
note
to
which
i
think
such
advice
should
be
set
i
will
not
burden
it
with
anything
awful
nor
weight
an
imperfect
diction
with
absolute
verities
in
which
i
do
indeed
believe
but
which
would
be
altogether
out
of
place
at
this
hour
of
the
evening
i
will
not
deny
that
from
eleven
till
one
and
especially
if
one
be
delivering
an
historical
or
better
still
a
theological
lecture
one
can
without
loss
of
dignity
allude
to
the
permanent
truth
the
permanent
beauty
and
the
permanent
security
without
which
human
life
wreathes
up
like
mist
and
is
at
the
best
futile
at
the
worst
tortured
but
you
must
remember
that
you
have
come
to
me
suddenly
with
a
most
important
question
after
dinner
that
i
have
but
just
completed
an
essay
upon
the
economic
effect
of
the
development
of
the
manchurian
coalfields
and
that
what
is
more
important
all
this
talk
began
in
a
certain
key
and
that
to
change
one
key
is
among
the
most
difficult
of
creative
actions
no
young
man
i
shall
not
venture
upon
the
true
reply
to
your
question
on
hearing
this
answer
the
young
man
began
to
curse
and
to
swear
and
to
say
that
he
had
looked
everywhere
for
help
and
had
never
found
it
that
he
was
minded
to
live
his
own
life
and
to
see
what
would
come
of
it
that
he
thought
the
older
man
knew
nothing
of
what
he
was
talking
about
but
was
wrapping
it
all
up
in
words
that
he
had
clearly
recognised
in
the
older
man
intolerable
prolixity
several
clichÃ©s
or
phrases
that
he
hoped
on
reaching
the
older
man
age
he
would
not
have
been
so
utterly
winnowed
of
all
substance
as
to
talk
so
aimlessly
and
finally
that
he
prayed
god
for
a
personal
development
more
full
of
justice
of
life
and
of
stuff
than
that
which
the
older
man
appeared
to
have
suffered
or
enjoyed
on
hearing
these
words
the
older
man
leapt
to
his
feet
which
was
not
an
easy
thing
for
him
to
do
and
as
one
overjoyed
grasped
the
younger
man
by
the
hand
though
the
latter
very
much
resented
such
antics
on
the
part
of
age
that
is
it
that
is
it
cried
the
older
man
looking
now
far
too
old
for
his
years
if
i
have
summoned
up
in
you
that
spirit
i
have
not
done
ill
get
you
forward
in
that
mood
and
when
you
come
to
my
time
of
life
you
will
be
as
rotund
and
hopeful
a
fellow
as
i
am
myself
but
having
heard
these
words
the
young
man
left
him
in
disgust
the
older
man
considering
all
these
things
as
he
looked
into
the
fire
when
he
was
alone
earnestly
desired
that
he
could
have
told
the
young
man
the
exact
truth
have
printed
it
and
have
produced
a
proper
gospel
but
considering
the
mountains
of
impossibility
that
lay
in
the
way
of
such
public
action
he
sighed
deeply
and
took
to
the
more
indirect
method
he
turned
to
his
work
and
continued
to
perform
his
own
duty
before
god
and
for
the
help
of
mankind
this
on
that
evening
was
for
him
a
review
upon
the
interpretation
of
the
word
in
the
domesday
inquest
this
kept
him
up
till
a
quarter
past
one
and
as
he
had
to
take
a
train
to
newcastle
at
eight
next
morning
it
is
probable
that
much
will
be
forgiven
him
when
things
are
cleared
on
the
departure
of
a
guest
ma
jeunesse
qui
va
adieu
la
tres
gente
compagne
oncques
ne
suis
moins
gai
pour
Ã§a
ma
jeunesse
qui
va
et
et
perd
gagne
ma
jeunesse
qui
from
the
author
mss
in
the
library
of
the
abbey
of
theleme
host
well
youth
i
see
you
are
about
to
leave
me
and
since
it
is
in
the
terms
of
your
service
by
no
means
to
exceed
a
certain
period
in
my
house
i
must
make
up
my
mind
to
bid
you
farewell
youth
indeed
i
would
stay
if
i
could
but
the
matter
lies
as
you
know
in
other
hands
and
i
may
not
stay
host
i
trust
dear
youth
that
you
have
found
all
comfortable
while
you
were
my
guest
that
the
air
has
suited
you
and
the
company
youth
i
thank
you
i
have
never
enjoyed
a
visit
more
you
may
say
that
i
have
been
most
unusually
happy
host
then
let
me
ring
for
the
servant
who
shall
bring
down
your
things
youth
i
thank
you
civilly
i
have
brought
them
down
already
see
they
are
here
i
have
but
two
one
very
large
bag
and
this
other
small
one
host
why
you
have
not
locked
the
small
one
see
it
gapes
youth
my
dear
host
to
tell
the
truth
i
usually
put
it
off
till
the
end
of
my
visits
but
the
truth
to
tell
the
truth
my
luggage
is
of
two
kinds
host
i
do
not
see
why
that
need
so
greatly
confuse
you
youth
more
but
you
see
the
fact
is
i
stay
with
people
so
long
that
well
that
very
often
they
forget
which
things
are
mine
and
which
belong
to
the
house
and
well
the
truth
is
that
i
have
to
take
away
with
me
a
number
of
things
which
which
in
a
word
you
may
possibly
have
thought
your
own
host
oh
youth
pray
do
not
think
the
worse
of
me
you
know
how
strict
are
my
orders
host
yes
i
know
you
will
plead
that
master
of
yours
and
no
doubt
you
are
right
but
tell
me
youth
what
are
those
things
youth
they
fill
this
big
bag
but
i
am
not
so
ungracious
as
you
think
see
in
this
little
bag
which
i
have
purposely
left
open
are
a
number
of
things
properly
mine
yet
of
which
i
am
allowed
to
make
gifts
to
those
with
whom
i
lingered
you
shall
choose
among
them
or
if
you
will
you
shall
have
them
all
host
well
first
tell
me
what
you
have
packed
in
the
big
bag
and
mean
to
take
away
youth
i
will
open
it
and
let
you
see
unlocks
it
and
pulls
the
things
i
fear
they
are
familiar
to
you
host
oh
youth
youth
must
you
take
away
all
of
these
why
you
are
taking
away
as
it
were
my
very
self
here
is
the
love
of
women
as
deep
and
changeable
as
an
opal
and
here
is
carelessness
that
looks
like
a
shower
of
pearls
and
here
i
see
oh
youth
for
shame
you
are
taking
away
that
silken
stuff
which
used
to
wrap
up
the
whole
and
which
you
once
told
me
had
no
name
but
which
lent
to
everything
it
held
plenitude
and
satisfaction
without
it
surely
pleasures
are
not
all
themselves
leave
me
that
at
least
youth
no
i
must
take
it
for
it
is
not
yours
though
from
courtesy
i
forbore
to
tell
you
so
till
now
these
also
go
facility
the
ointment
sleep
the
drug
full
laughter
that
tolerated
all
follies
it
was
the
only
musical
thing
in
the
house
and
i
must
take
yes
i
fear
i
must
take
verse
host
then
there
is
nothing
left
youth
oh
yes
see
this
little
open
bag
which
you
may
choose
from
feel
it
host
certainly
it
is
very
heavy
but
it
rattles
and
is
uncertain
youth
that
is
because
it
is
made
up
of
divers
things
having
no
similarity
and
you
may
take
all
or
leave
all
or
choose
as
you
will
here
up
a
is
ambition
will
you
have
that
host
i
can
not
tell
it
has
been
mine
and
yet
without
those
other
things
youth
very
well
i
will
leave
it
you
shall
decide
on
it
a
few
years
hence
then
here
is
the
perfume
pride
will
you
have
that
host
no
i
will
have
none
of
it
it
is
false
and
corrupt
and
only
yesterday
i
was
for
throwing
it
out
of
window
to
sweeten
the
air
in
my
room
youth
so
far
you
have
chosen
well
now
pray
choose
more
host
i
will
have
this
and
this
and
this
i
will
take
health
it
out
of
the
not
that
it
is
of
much
use
to
me
without
those
other
things
but
i
have
grown
used
to
it
then
i
will
take
this
out
a
plain
steel
purse
and
which
is
the
tradition
of
my
family
and
which
i
desire
to
leave
to
my
son
i
must
have
it
cleaned
then
i
will
take
this
out
a
which
is
the
sense
of
form
and
colour
i
am
told
it
is
of
less
value
later
on
but
it
is
a
pleasant
ornament
and
so
youth
goodbye
youth
a
mysterious
wait
i
have
something
else
for
you
feels
in
his
ticket
no
less
a
thing
feels
again
in
his
watch
than
looks
a
trifle
anxious
and
feels
in
his
waistcoat
a
promise
from
my
master
signed
and
sealed
to
give
you
back
all
i
take
and
more
in
immortality
feels
in
his
handkerchief
host
oh
youth
youth
do
not
thank
me
it
is
my
master
you
should
thank
dear
me
i
hope
i
have
not
lost
it
in
his
trousers
host
lost
it
youth
i
did
not
say
i
had
lost
it
i
said
i
hoped
i
had
not
in
his
pocket
and
pulls
out
an
ah
here
it
is
face
clouds
no
that
is
the
message
to
george
telling
her
the
time
has
come
to
get
a
wig
do
you
know
i
am
afraid
i
have
lost
it
i
am
really
very
sorry
i
can
not
wait
goes
on
death
i
knew
a
man
once
who
made
a
great
case
of
death
saying
that
he
esteemed
a
country
according
to
its
regard
for
the
conception
of
death
and
according
to
the
respect
which
it
paid
to
that
conception
he
also
said
that
he
considered
individuals
by
much
the
same
standard
but
that
he
did
not
judge
them
so
strictly
in
the
matter
because
said
he
great
masses
of
men
are
more
permanently
concerned
with
great
issues
whereas
private
citizens
are
disturbed
by
little
particular
things
which
interfere
with
their
little
particular
lives
and
so
distract
them
from
the
general
end
this
was
upon
a
river
called
boutonne
in
vendÃ©e
and
at
the
time
i
did
not
understand
what
he
meant
because
as
yet
i
had
had
no
experience
of
these
things
but
this
man
to
whom
i
spoke
had
had
three
kinds
of
experience
first
he
had
himself
been
very
probably
the
occasion
of
death
in
others
for
he
had
been
a
soldier
in
a
war
of
conquest
where
the
europeans
were
few
and
the
barbarians
many
secondly
he
had
been
himself
very
often
wounded
and
more
than
once
all
but
killed
thirdly
he
was
at
the
time
he
told
me
this
thing
an
old
man
who
must
in
any
case
soon
come
to
that
experience
or
catastrophe
of
which
he
spoke
he
was
an
innkeeper
the
father
of
two
daughters
and
his
inn
was
by
the
side
of
the
river
but
the
road
ran
between
his
face
was
more
anxiously
earnest
than
is
commonly
the
face
of
a
french
peasant
as
though
he
had
suffered
more
than
do
ordinarily
that
very
prosperous
very
virile
and
very
race
of
men
he
had
also
about
him
what
many
men
show
who
have
come
sharply
against
the
great
realities
that
is
a
sort
of
diffidence
in
talking
of
ordinary
things
i
could
see
that
in
the
matters
of
his
household
he
allowed
himself
to
be
led
by
women
meanwhile
he
continued
to
talk
to
me
over
the
table
upon
this
business
of
death
and
as
he
talked
he
showed
that
desire
to
persuade
which
is
in
itself
the
strongest
motive
of
interest
in
any
human
discourse
he
said
to
me
that
those
who
affected
to
despise
the
consideration
of
death
knew
nothing
of
it
that
they
had
never
seen
it
close
and
might
be
compared
to
men
who
spoke
of
battles
when
they
had
only
read
books
about
battles
or
who
spoke
of
though
they
had
never
seen
the
sea
this
last
metaphor
he
used
with
some
pride
for
he
had
crossed
the
mediterranean
from
provence
to
africa
some
five
or
six
times
and
had
upon
each
occasion
suffered
horribly
for
of
course
his
garrison
had
been
upon
the
edge
of
the
desert
and
he
had
been
a
soldier
beyond
the
atlas
he
told
me
that
those
who
affected
to
neglect
or
to
despise
death
were
worse
than
children
talking
of
things
and
were
more
like
prigs
talking
of
physical
things
of
which
they
knew
nothing
i
told
him
then
that
there
were
many
such
men
especially
in
the
town
of
geneva
this
he
said
he
could
well
believe
though
he
had
never
travelled
there
and
had
hardly
heard
the
name
of
the
place
but
he
knew
it
for
some
foreign
town
he
told
me
also
that
there
were
men
about
in
his
own
part
of
the
world
who
pretended
that
since
death
was
an
accident
like
any
other
and
moreover
one
as
certain
as
hunger
or
as
sleep
it
was
not
to
be
considered
these
he
said
were
the
worst
debaters
upon
his
favourite
subject
now
as
he
talked
in
this
fashion
i
confess
that
i
was
very
bored
i
had
desired
to
go
on
to
angoulÃ©me
upon
my
bicycle
and
i
was
at
that
age
when
all
human
beings
think
themselves
immortal
i
had
desired
to
get
off
the
main
high
road
into
the
hills
upon
the
left
to
the
east
of
it
and
i
was
at
an
age
when
the
cessation
of
mundane
experience
is
not
a
conceivable
thing
moreover
this
innkeeper
had
been
pointed
out
to
me
as
a
man
who
could
give
very
useful
information
upon
the
nature
of
the
roads
i
had
to
travel
and
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
that
he
would
switch
me
off
after
dinner
upon
a
hobby
of
his
own
after
a
wider
travel
i
know
well
that
all
innkeepers
have
hobbies
and
that
an
abstract
or
mystical
hobby
of
this
sort
is
amongst
the
best
with
which
to
pass
an
evening
but
no
matter
i
am
talking
of
then
and
not
now
he
kept
me
therefore
uninterested
as
i
was
and
continued
people
who
put
death
away
from
them
who
do
not
neglect
or
despise
it
but
who
stop
thinking
about
it
annoy
me
very
much
we
have
in
this
village
a
chemist
of
such
a
kind
he
will
have
it
that
five
minutes
afterwards
a
man
thinks
no
more
about
it
having
gone
so
far
the
innkeeper
clenching
his
hands
and
fixing
me
with
a
brilliant
glance
from
his
old
eyes
said
with
such
men
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
indeed
that
his
chief
subject
should
be
treated
in
such
a
fashion
was
odious
to
him
and
rightly
for
of
the
things
worth
strict
consideration
there
is
no
doubt
that
his
hobby
was
the
chief
and
to
have
one
hobby
vulgarly
despised
is
intolerable
the
innkeeper
then
went
on
to
tell
me
that
so
far
as
he
could
make
out
it
was
a
man
business
to
consider
this
subject
of
death
continually
to
wonder
upon
it
and
if
he
could
to
extract
its
meaning
of
the
men
i
had
met
so
far
in
life
only
the
scotch
and
certain
of
the
western
french
went
on
in
this
metaphysical
manner
thus
a
breton
a
basque
and
a
man
in
ecclefechan
i
hope
i
spell
it
right
and
another
in
jedburgh
had
already
each
of
them
sent
me
to
my
bed
confused
upon
the
matter
of
free
will
so
this
western
innkeeper
refused
to
leave
his
thesis
it
was
incredible
to
him
that
a
sentient
being
who
perpetually
accumulated
experience
who
grew
riper
and
riper
more
and
more
full
of
such
knowledge
as
was
native
to
himself
and
complementary
to
his
nature
should
at
the
very
crisis
of
his
success
in
all
things
intellectual
and
emotional
cease
suddenly
it
was
further
an
object
to
him
of
vast
curiosity
why
such
a
being
since
a
future
was
essential
to
it
should
find
that
future
veiled
he
presented
to
me
a
picture
of
men
perpetually
passing
through
a
field
of
vision
out
of
the
dark
and
into
the
dark
he
showed
me
these
men
not
growing
and
falling
as
fruits
do
so
the
modern
vulgar
conception
goes
but
alive
throughout
their
transit
pouring
like
an
unbroken
river
from
one
sharp
limit
of
the
horizon
whence
they
entered
into
life
to
that
other
sharp
limit
where
they
poured
out
from
life
not
through
decay
but
through
a
sudden
catastrophe
i
said
he
shall
die
i
do
suppose
with
a
full
consciousness
of
my
being
and
with
a
great
fear
in
my
eyes
and
though
many
die
decrepit
and
senile
that
is
not
the
normal
death
of
men
for
men
have
in
them
something
of
a
power
which
pushes
them
on
to
the
further
realisation
of
themselves
right
up
to
the
edge
of
their
doom
i
put
his
words
in
english
after
a
great
many
years
but
they
were
something
of
this
kind
for
he
was
a
metaphysical
sort
of
man
it
was
now
near
midnight
and
i
could
bear
with
such
discussions
no
longer
my
fatigue
was
great
and
the
hour
at
which
i
had
to
rise
next
day
was
early
it
was
therefore
in
but
a
drowsy
state
that
i
heard
him
continue
his
discourse
he
told
me
a
long
story
of
how
he
had
seen
one
day
a
company
of
young
men
of
the
new
army
the
conscripts
go
marching
past
his
house
along
the
river
through
a
driving
snow
he
said
that
first
he
heard
them
singing
long
before
he
saw
them
that
then
they
came
out
like
ghosts
for
a
moment
through
the
drift
that
then
in
the
half
light
of
the
winter
dawn
they
clearly
appeared
all
in
step
for
once
swinging
forward
muffled
in
their
dark
blue
coats
and
still
singing
to
the
lift
of
their
feet
that
then
on
their
way
to
the
seaport
they
passed
again
into
the
blinding
scurry
of
the
snow
that
they
seemed
like
ghosts
again
for
a
moment
behind
the
veil
of
it
and
that
long
after
they
had
disappeared
their
singing
could
still
be
heard
by
this
time
i
was
most
confused
as
to
what
lesson
he
would
convey
and
sleep
had
nearly
overcome
me
but
i
remember
his
telling
me
that
such
a
sight
stood
to
him
at
the
moment
and
did
still
stand
for
the
passage
of
the
french
armies
perpetually
on
into
the
dark
century
after
century
destroyed
for
the
most
part
upon
fields
of
battle
he
told
me
that
he
felt
like
one
who
had
seen
the
retreat
from
moscow
and
he
would
i
am
sure
had
i
not
determined
to
leave
him
and
to
take
at
least
some
little
sleep
have
asked
me
what
fate
there
was
for
those
single
private
soldiers
each
real
each
existent
while
the
army
which
they
made
up
and
of
whose
destruction
men
spoke
was
but
a
number
a
notion
a
name
he
would
have
pestered
me
if
my
mind
had
still
been
active
as
to
what
their
secret
destinies
were
who
lay
each
man
alone
twisted
round
the
guns
after
the
failure
to
hold
the
bridge
of
the
beresina
he
might
have
gone
deeper
but
i
was
too
tired
to
listen
to
him
any
more
this
human
debate
of
ours
and
very
it
was
is
now
resolved
for
in
the
interval
since
it
was
engaged
the
innkeeper
himself
has
died
on
coming
to
an
end
of
all
the
simple
actions
in
the
world
of
all
the
simple
actions
in
the
world
one
would
think
it
could
be
done
with
less
effort
than
the
heaving
of
a
sigh
well
then
one
would
be
wrong
there
is
no
case
of
coming
to
an
end
but
has
about
it
something
of
an
effort
and
a
jerk
as
though
nature
abhorred
it
and
though
it
be
true
that
some
achieve
a
quiet
and
a
perfect
end
to
one
thing
or
another
as
for
instance
to
life
yet
this
achievement
is
not
arrived
at
save
through
the
utmost
toil
and
consequent
upon
the
most
persevering
and
exquisite
art
now
you
can
say
that
this
may
be
true
of
sentient
things
but
not
of
things
inanimate
it
is
true
even
of
things
inanimate
look
down
some
straight
railway
line
for
a
vanishing
point
to
the
perspective
you
will
never
find
it
or
try
to
mark
the
moment
when
a
small
target
becomes
invisible
there
is
no
gradation
a
moment
it
was
there
and
you
missed
it
possibly
because
the
authorities
were
not
going
in
for
journalism
that
day
and
had
not
chosen
a
dead
calm
with
the
light
full
on
the
canvas
a
moment
it
was
there
and
then
as
you
steamed
on
it
was
gone
the
same
is
true
of
a
lark
in
the
air
you
see
it
and
then
you
do
not
see
it
you
only
hear
its
song
and
the
same
is
true
of
that
song
you
hear
it
and
then
suddenly
you
do
not
hear
it
it
is
true
of
a
human
voice
which
is
familiar
in
your
ear
living
and
inhabiting
the
rooms
of
your
house
there
comes
a
day
when
it
ceases
altogether
and
how
positive
how
definite
and
hard
is
that
coming
to
an
end
it
does
not
leave
an
echo
behind
it
but
a
sharp
edge
of
emptiness
and
very
often
as
one
sits
beside
the
fire
the
memory
of
that
voice
suddenly
returning
gives
to
the
silence
about
one
a
personal
force
as
it
were
of
obsession
and
of
control
so
much
happens
when
even
one
of
all
our
million
voices
comes
to
an
end
it
is
necessary
it
is
august
and
it
is
reasonable
that
the
great
story
of
our
lives
also
should
be
accomplished
and
should
reach
a
term
and
yet
there
is
something
in
that
hidden
duality
of
ours
which
makes
the
prospect
of
so
natural
a
conclusion
terrible
and
it
is
the
better
judgment
of
mankind
and
the
mature
conclusion
of
civilisations
in
their
age
that
there
is
not
only
a
conclusion
here
but
something
of
an
adventure
also
it
may
be
so
those
who
solace
mankind
and
are
the
principal
benefactors
of
it
i
mean
the
poets
and
the
musicians
have
attempted
always
to
ease
the
prospect
of
coming
to
an
end
whether
it
were
the
coming
to
an
end
of
the
things
we
love
or
of
that
daily
habit
and
conversation
which
is
our
life
and
is
the
atmosphere
wherein
we
loved
them
indeed
this
is
a
clear
test
whereby
you
may
distinguish
the
great
artists
from
the
mean
hucksters
and
charlatans
that
the
first
approach
and
reveal
what
is
dreadful
with
calm
and
as
it
were
with
a
purpose
to
use
it
for
good
while
the
vulgar
catchpenny
fellows
must
liven
up
their
bad
dishes
as
with
a
cheap
sauce
of
the
horrible
caring
nothing
so
that
their
shrieks
sell
whether
we
are
the
better
for
them
or
no
the
great
poets
i
say
bring
us
easily
or
grandly
to
the
gate
as
in
that
to
a
where
it
is
thought
good
in
an
immortal
phrase
to
pass
painlessly
at
midnight
or
in
the
glorious
line
which
ronsard
uses
like
a
salute
with
the
sword
hailing
la
profitable
mort
the
noblest
or
the
most
perfect
of
english
elegies
leaves
as
a
sort
of
savour
after
the
reading
of
it
no
terror
at
all
nor
even
too
much
regret
but
the
landscape
of
england
at
evening
when
the
smoke
of
the
cottages
mixes
with
autumn
vapours
among
the
elms
and
even
that
gloomy
modern
to
the
west
unfinished
and
touched
with
despair
though
it
will
speak
of
that
outer
place
forlorn
which
like
an
infinite
grey
sea
surrounds
with
everlasting
calm
the
land
of
human
sounds
yet
also
returns
to
the
sacramental
earth
of
one
childhood
where
it
says
for
now
the
night
completed
tells
her
tale
of
rest
and
dissolution
gathering
round
her
mist
in
such
persuasion
that
the
ground
of
home
consents
to
falter
and
grow
pale
and
the
stars
are
put
out
and
the
trees
fail
nor
anything
remains
but
that
which
drones
enormous
through
the
dark
and
again
in
another
place
where
it
prays
that
one
may
at
the
last
be
fed
with
beauty
as
the
flowers
are
fed
that
fill
their
with
generous
breath
let
me
attain
a
natural
end
of
death
and
on
the
mighty
breast
as
on
a
bed
lay
decently
at
last
a
drowsy
head
content
to
lapse
in
somnolence
and
fade
in
dreaming
once
again
the
dream
of
all
things
made
the
most
careful
philosophy
the
most
heavenly
music
the
best
choice
of
poetic
or
prosaic
phrase
prepare
men
properly
for
perpetual
loss
of
this
and
of
that
and
introduce
us
proudly
to
the
similar
and
greater
business
of
departure
from
them
all
from
whatever
of
them
all
remains
at
the
close
to
be
introduced
to
be
prepared
to
be
armoured
all
these
are
excellent
things
but
there
is
a
question
no
foresight
can
answer
nor
any
comprehension
resolve
it
is
right
to
gather
upon
that
question
the
varied
affections
or
perceptions
of
varying
men
i
knew
a
man
once
in
the
tourdenoise
a
gloomy
man
but
very
rich
who
cared
little
for
the
things
he
knew
this
man
took
no
pleasure
in
his
fruitful
orchards
and
his
carefully
ploughed
fields
and
his
harvests
he
took
pleasure
in
pine
trees
he
was
a
man
of
groves
and
of
the
dark
for
him
that
things
should
come
to
an
end
was
but
part
of
an
universal
rhythm
a
part
pleasing
to
the
general
harmony
and
making
in
the
music
of
the
world
about
him
a
solemn
and
oh
a
conclusive
chord
this
man
would
study
the
sky
at
night
and
take
from
it
a
larger
and
a
larger
draught
of
infinitude
finding
in
this
exercise
not
a
mere
satisfaction
but
an
object
and
goal
for
the
mind
when
he
had
so
wandered
for
a
while
under
the
night
he
seemed
for
the
moment
to
have
reached
the
object
of
his
being
and
i
knew
another
man
in
the
weald
who
worked
with
his
hands
and
was
always
kind
and
knew
his
trade
well
he
smiled
when
he
talked
of
scythes
and
he
could
thatch
he
could
fish
also
and
he
knew
about
grafting
and
about
the
seasons
of
plants
and
birds
and
the
way
of
seed
he
had
a
face
full
of
weather
he
fatigued
his
body
he
watched
his
land
he
would
not
talk
much
of
mysteries
he
would
rather
hum
songs
he
loved
new
friends
and
old
he
had
lived
with
one
wife
for
fifty
years
and
he
had
five
children
who
were
a
policeman
a
schoolmistress
a
son
at
home
and
two
who
were
sailors
this
man
said
that
what
a
man
did
and
the
life
in
which
he
did
it
was
like
the
farmwork
upon
a
summer
day
he
said
one
works
a
little
and
rests
and
works
a
little
again
and
one
drinks
and
there
is
a
perpetual
talk
with
those
about
one
then
he
would
say
the
shadows
lengthen
at
evening
the
wind
falls
the
birds
get
back
home
and
as
for
ourselves
we
are
sleepy
before
it
is
dark
then
also
i
knew
a
third
man
who
lived
in
a
town
and
was
clerical
and
did
no
work
for
he
had
money
of
his
own
this
man
said
that
all
we
do
and
the
time
in
which
we
do
it
is
rather
a
night
than
a
day
he
said
that
when
we
came
to
an
end
we
vanished
we
and
our
works
but
that
we
vanished
into
a
broadening
light
which
of
these
three
knew
best
the
nature
of
man
and
of
his
works
and
which
knew
best
of
what
nature
was
the
end
why
so
glum
my
lad
or
my
lass
as
the
case
may
be
why
so
heavy
at
heart
did
you
not
know
that
you
also
must
come
to
an
end
why
that
woman
of
etaples
who
sold
such
southern
wine
for
the
dissipation
of
the
picardian
mist
her
time
is
over
and
gone
and
the
wine
has
been
drunk
long
ago
and
the
singers
in
her
house
have
departed
and
the
wind
of
the
sea
moans
in
and
fills
their
hall
the
lords
who
died
in
roncesvalles
have
been
dead
these
thousand
years
and
more
and
the
loud
song
about
them
grew
very
faint
and
dwindled
and
is
silent
now
there
is
nothing
at
all
remains
it
is
certain
that
the
hills
decay
and
that
rivers
as
the
dusty
years
proceed
run
feebly
and
lose
themselves
at
last
in
desert
sands
and
in
its
aeons
the
very
firmament
grows
old
but
evil
also
is
perishable
and
bad
men
meet
their
judge
be
comforted
now
of
all
endings
of
all
comings
to
an
end
none
is
so
hesitating
as
the
ending
of
a
book
which
the
publisher
will
have
so
long
and
the
writer
so
short
and
the
public
god
bless
the
public
will
have
whatever
it
is
given
books
however
much
their
lingering
books
also
must
come
to
an
end
it
is
abhorrent
to
their
nature
as
to
the
life
of
man
they
must
be
sharply
cut
off
let
it
be
done
at
once
and
fixed
as
by
a
spell
and
the
power
of
a
word
the
word
finis
