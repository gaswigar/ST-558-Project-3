courage

introduction
lysimachus
the
son
of
aristides
the
just
and
melesias
the
son
of
the
elder
thucydides
two
aged
men
who
live
together
are
desirous
of
educating
their
sons
in
the
best
manner
their
own
education
as
often
happens
with
the
sons
of
great
men
has
been
neglected
and
they
are
resolved
that
their
children
shall
have
more
care
taken
of
them
than
they
received
themselves
at
the
hands
of
their
fathers
at
their
request
nicias
and
laches
have
accompanied
them
to
see
a
man
named
stesilaus
fighting
in
heavy
armour
the
two
fathers
ask
the
two
generals
what
they
think
of
this
exhibition
and
whether
they
would
advise
that
their
sons
should
acquire
the
accomplishment
nicias
and
laches
are
quite
willing
to
give
their
opinion
but
they
suggest
that
socrates
should
be
invited
to
take
part
in
the
consultation
he
is
a
stranger
to
lysimachus
but
is
afterwards
recognised
as
the
son
of
his
old
friend
sophroniscus
with
whom
he
never
had
a
difference
to
the
hour
of
his
death
socrates
is
also
known
to
nicias
to
whom
he
had
introduced
the
excellent
damon
musician
and
sophist
as
a
tutor
for
his
son
and
to
laches
who
had
witnessed
his
heroic
behaviour
at
the
battle
of
delium
compare
socrates
as
he
is
younger
than
either
nicias
or
laches
prefers
to
wait
until
they
have
delivered
their
opinions
which
they
give
in
a
characteristic
manner
nicias
the
tactician
is
very
much
in
favour
of
the
new
art
which
he
describes
as
the
gymnastics
of
war
useful
when
the
ranks
are
formed
and
still
more
useful
when
they
are
broken
creating
a
general
interest
in
military
studies
and
greatly
adding
to
the
appearance
of
the
soldier
in
the
field
laches
the
blunt
warrior
is
of
opinion
that
such
an
art
is
not
knowledge
and
can
not
be
of
any
value
because
the
lacedaemonians
those
great
masters
of
arms
neglect
it
his
own
experience
in
actual
service
has
taught
him
that
these
pretenders
are
useless
and
ridiculous
this
man
stesilaus
has
been
seen
by
him
on
board
ship
making
a
very
sorry
exhibition
of
himself
the
possession
of
the
art
will
make
the
coward
rash
and
subject
the
courageous
if
he
chance
to
make
a
slip
to
invidious
remarks
and
now
let
socrates
be
taken
into
counsel
as
they
differ
he
must
decide
socrates
would
rather
not
decide
the
question
by
a
plurality
of
votes
in
such
a
serious
matter
as
the
education
of
a
friend
children
he
would
consult
the
one
skilled
person
who
has
had
masters
and
has
works
to
show
as
evidences
of
his
skill
this
is
not
himself
for
he
has
never
been
able
to
pay
the
sophists
for
instructing
him
and
has
never
had
the
wit
to
do
or
discover
anything
but
nicias
and
laches
are
older
and
richer
than
he
is
they
have
had
teachers
and
perhaps
have
made
discoveries
and
he
would
have
trusted
them
entirely
if
they
had
not
been
diametrically
opposed
lysimachus
here
proposes
to
resign
the
argument
into
the
hands
of
the
younger
part
of
the
company
as
he
is
old
and
has
a
bad
memory
he
earnestly
requests
socrates
to
remain
in
this
showing
as
nicias
says
how
little
he
knows
the
man
who
will
certainly
not
go
away
until
he
has
the
company
about
their
past
lives
nicias
has
often
submitted
to
this
process
and
laches
is
quite
willing
to
learn
from
socrates
because
his
actions
in
the
true
dorian
mode
correspond
to
his
words
socrates
proceeds
we
might
ask
who
are
our
teachers
but
a
better
and
more
thorough
way
of
examining
the
question
will
be
to
ask
is
virtue
or
rather
to
restrict
the
enquiry
to
that
part
of
virtue
which
is
concerned
with
the
use
of
weapons
is
courage
laches
thinks
that
he
knows
this
is
courageous
who
remains
at
his
post
but
some
nations
fight
flying
after
the
manner
of
aeneas
in
homer
or
as
the
spartans
also
did
at
the
battle
of
plataea
socrates
wants
a
more
general
definition
not
only
of
military
courage
but
of
courage
of
all
sorts
tried
both
amid
pleasures
and
pains
laches
replies
that
this
universal
courage
is
endurance
but
courage
is
a
good
thing
and
mere
endurance
may
be
hurtful
and
injurious
therefore
the
element
of
intelligence
must
be
added
but
then
again
unintelligent
endurance
may
often
be
more
courageous
than
the
intelligent
the
bad
than
the
good
how
is
this
contradiction
to
be
solved
socrates
and
laches
are
not
set
the
dorian
mode
of
words
and
actions
for
their
words
are
all
confusion
although
their
actions
are
courageous
still
they
must
in
an
argument
about
endurance
laches
is
very
willing
and
is
quite
sure
that
he
knows
what
courage
is
if
he
could
only
tell
nicias
is
now
appealed
to
and
in
reply
he
offers
a
definition
which
he
has
heard
from
socrates
himself
to
the
effect
that
is
intelligence
laches
derides
this
and
socrates
enquires
sort
of
intelligence
to
which
nicias
replies
of
things
terrible
every
man
knows
the
things
to
be
dreaded
in
his
own
art
they
do
not
they
may
predict
results
but
can
not
tell
whether
they
are
really
terrible
only
the
courageous
man
can
tell
that
laches
draws
the
inference
that
the
courageous
man
is
either
a
soothsayer
or
a
god
again
in
nicias
way
of
speaking
the
term
must
be
denied
to
animals
or
children
because
they
do
not
know
the
danger
against
this
inversion
of
the
ordinary
use
of
language
laches
reclaims
but
is
in
some
degree
mollified
by
a
compliment
to
his
own
courage
still
he
does
not
like
to
see
an
athenian
statesman
and
general
descending
to
sophistries
of
this
sort
socrates
resumes
the
argument
courage
has
been
defined
to
be
intelligence
or
knowledge
of
the
terrible
and
courage
is
not
all
virtue
but
only
one
of
the
virtues
the
terrible
is
in
the
future
and
therefore
the
knowledge
of
the
terrible
is
a
knowledge
of
the
future
but
there
can
be
no
knowledge
of
future
good
or
evil
separated
from
a
knowledge
of
the
good
and
evil
of
the
past
or
present
that
is
to
say
of
all
good
and
evil
courage
therefore
is
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
generally
but
he
who
has
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
generally
must
not
only
have
courage
but
also
temperance
justice
and
every
other
virtue
thus
a
single
virtue
would
be
the
same
as
all
virtues
compare
protagoras
and
after
all
the
two
generals
and
socrates
the
hero
of
delium
are
still
in
ignorance
of
the
nature
of
courage
they
must
go
to
school
again
boys
old
men
and
all
some
points
of
resemblance
and
some
points
of
difference
appear
in
the
laches
when
compared
with
the
charmides
and
lysis
there
is
less
of
poetical
and
simple
beauty
and
more
of
dramatic
interest
and
power
they
are
richer
in
the
externals
of
the
scene
the
laches
has
more
play
and
development
of
character
in
the
lysis
and
charmides
the
youths
are
the
central
figures
and
frequent
allusions
are
made
to
the
place
of
meeting
which
is
a
palaestra
here
the
place
of
meeting
which
is
also
a
palaestra
is
quite
forgotten
and
the
boys
play
a
subordinate
part
the
seance
is
of
old
and
elder
men
of
whom
socrates
is
the
youngest
first
is
the
aged
lysimachus
who
may
be
compared
with
cephalus
in
the
republic
and
like
him
withdraws
from
the
argument
melesias
who
is
only
his
shadow
also
subsides
into
silence
both
of
them
by
their
own
confession
have
been
as
is
further
shown
by
the
circumstance
that
lysimachus
the
friend
of
sophroniscus
has
never
heard
of
the
fame
of
socrates
his
son
they
belong
to
different
circles
in
the
meno
their
want
of
education
in
all
but
the
arts
of
riding
and
wrestling
is
adduced
as
a
proof
that
virtue
can
not
be
taught
the
recognition
of
socrates
by
lysimachus
is
extremely
graceful
and
his
military
exploits
naturally
connect
him
with
the
two
generals
of
whom
one
has
witnessed
them
the
characters
of
nicias
and
laches
are
indicated
by
their
opinions
on
the
exhibition
of
the
man
fighting
in
heavy
armour
the
more
enlightened
nicias
is
quite
ready
to
accept
the
new
art
which
laches
treats
with
ridicule
seeming
to
think
that
this
or
any
other
military
question
may
be
settled
by
asking
do
the
lacedaemonians
say
the
one
is
the
thoughtful
general
willing
to
avail
himself
of
any
discovery
in
the
art
of
war
aristoph
aves
the
other
is
the
practical
man
who
relies
on
his
own
experience
and
is
the
enemy
of
innovation
he
can
act
but
can
not
speak
and
is
apt
to
lose
his
temper
it
is
to
be
noted
that
one
of
them
is
supposed
to
be
a
hearer
of
socrates
the
other
is
only
acquainted
with
his
actions
laches
is
the
admirer
of
the
dorian
mode
and
into
his
mouth
the
remark
is
put
that
there
are
some
persons
who
having
never
been
taught
are
better
than
those
who
have
like
a
novice
in
the
art
of
disputation
he
is
delighted
with
the
hits
of
socrates
and
is
disposed
to
be
angry
with
the
refinements
of
nicias
in
the
discussion
of
the
main
thesis
of
the
dialogue
is
courage
the
antagonism
of
the
two
characters
is
still
more
clearly
brought
out
and
in
this
as
in
the
preliminary
question
the
truth
is
parted
between
them
gradually
and
not
without
difficulty
laches
is
made
to
pass
on
from
the
more
popular
to
the
more
philosophical
it
has
never
occurred
to
him
that
there
was
any
other
courage
than
that
of
the
soldier
and
only
by
an
effort
of
the
mind
can
he
frame
a
general
notion
at
all
no
sooner
has
this
general
notion
been
formed
than
it
evanesces
before
the
dialectic
of
socrates
and
nicias
appears
from
the
other
side
with
the
socratic
doctrine
that
courage
is
knowledge
this
is
explained
to
mean
knowledge
of
things
terrible
in
the
future
but
socrates
denies
that
the
knowledge
of
the
future
is
separable
from
that
of
the
past
and
present
in
other
words
true
knowledge
is
not
that
of
the
soothsayer
but
of
the
philosopher
and
all
knowledge
will
thus
be
equivalent
to
all
virtue
a
position
which
elsewhere
socrates
is
not
unwilling
to
admit
but
which
will
not
assist
us
in
distinguishing
the
nature
of
courage
in
this
part
of
the
dialogue
the
contrast
between
the
mode
of
which
is
practised
by
laches
and
by
socrates
and
also
the
manner
in
which
the
definition
of
laches
is
made
to
approximate
to
that
of
nicias
are
worthy
of
attention
thus
with
some
intimation
of
the
connexion
and
unity
of
virtue
and
knowledge
we
arrive
at
no
distinct
result
the
two
aspects
of
courage
are
never
harmonized
the
knowledge
which
in
the
protagoras
is
explained
as
the
faculty
of
estimating
pleasures
and
pains
is
here
lost
in
an
unmeaning
and
transcendental
conception
yet
several
true
intimations
of
the
nature
of
courage
are
allowed
to
appear
that
courage
is
moral
as
well
as
physical
that
true
courage
is
inseparable
from
knowledge
and
yet
is
based
on
a
natural
instinct
laches
exhibits
one
aspect
of
courage
nicias
the
other
the
perfect
image
and
harmony
of
both
is
only
realized
in
socrates
himself
the
dialogue
offers
one
among
many
examples
of
the
freedom
with
which
plato
treats
facts
for
the
scene
must
be
supposed
to
have
occurred
between
the
year
of
the
battle
of
delium
and
the
year
of
the
battle
of
mantinea
at
which
laches
fell
but
if
socrates
was
more
than
seventy
years
of
age
at
his
trial
in
see
apology
he
could
not
have
been
a
young
man
at
any
time
after
the
battle
of
delium

socrates
lysimachus
you
have
seen
the
exhibition
of
the
man
fighting
in
armour
nicias
and
laches
but
we
did
not
tell
you
at
the
time
the
reason
why
my
friend
melesias
and
i
asked
you
to
go
with
us
and
see
him
i
think
that
we
may
as
well
confess
what
this
was
for
we
certainly
ought
not
to
have
any
reserve
with
you
the
reason
was
that
we
were
intending
to
ask
your
advice
some
laugh
at
the
very
notion
of
advising
others
and
when
they
are
asked
will
not
say
what
they
think
they
guess
at
the
wishes
of
the
person
who
asks
them
and
answer
according
to
his
and
not
according
to
their
own
opinion
but
as
we
know
that
you
are
good
judges
and
will
say
exactly
what
you
think
we
have
taken
you
into
our
counsels
the
matter
about
which
i
am
making
all
this
preface
is
as
follows
melesias
and
i
have
two
sons
that
is
his
son
and
he
is
named
thucydides
after
his
grandfather
and
this
is
mine
who
is
also
called
after
his
grandfather
aristides
now
we
are
resolved
to
take
the
greatest
care
of
the
youths
and
not
to
let
them
run
about
as
they
like
which
is
too
often
the
way
with
the
young
when
they
are
no
longer
children
but
to
begin
at
once
and
do
the
utmost
that
we
can
for
them
and
knowing
you
to
have
sons
of
your
own
we
thought
that
you
were
most
likely
to
have
attended
to
their
training
and
improvement
and
if
perchance
you
have
not
attended
to
them
we
may
remind
you
that
you
ought
to
have
done
so
and
would
invite
you
to
assist
us
in
the
fulfilment
of
a
common
duty
i
will
tell
you
nicias
and
laches
even
at
the
risk
of
being
tedious
how
we
came
to
think
of
this
melesias
and
i
live
together
and
our
sons
live
with
us
and
now
as
i
was
saying
at
first
we
are
going
to
confess
to
you
both
of
us
often
talk
to
the
lads
about
the
many
noble
deeds
which
our
own
fathers
did
in
war
and
peace
in
the
management
of
the
allies
and
in
the
administration
of
the
city
but
neither
of
us
has
any
deeds
of
his
own
which
he
can
show
the
truth
is
that
we
are
ashamed
of
this
contrast
being
seen
by
them
and
we
blame
our
fathers
for
letting
us
be
spoiled
in
the
days
of
our
youth
while
they
were
occupied
with
the
concerns
of
others
and
we
urge
all
this
upon
the
lads
pointing
out
to
them
that
they
will
not
grow
up
to
honour
if
they
are
rebellious
and
take
no
pains
about
themselves
but
that
if
they
take
pains
they
may
perhaps
become
worthy
of
the
names
which
they
bear
they
on
their
part
promise
to
comply
with
our
wishes
and
our
care
is
to
discover
what
studies
or
pursuits
are
likely
to
be
most
improving
to
them
some
one
commended
to
us
the
art
of
fighting
in
armour
which
he
thought
an
excellent
accomplishment
for
a
young
man
to
learn
and
he
praised
the
man
whose
exhibition
you
have
seen
and
told
us
to
go
and
see
him
and
we
determined
that
we
would
go
and
get
you
to
accompany
us
and
we
were
intending
at
the
same
time
if
you
did
not
object
to
take
counsel
with
you
about
the
education
of
our
sons
that
is
the
matter
which
we
wanted
to
talk
over
with
you
and
we
hope
that
you
will
give
us
your
opinion
about
this
art
of
fighting
in
armour
and
about
any
other
studies
or
pursuits
which
may
or
may
not
be
desirable
for
a
young
man
to
learn
please
to
say
whether
you
agree
to
our
proposal
nicias
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
lysimachus
and
melesias
i
applaud
your
purpose
and
will
gladly
assist
you
and
i
believe
that
you
laches
will
be
equally
glad
laches
certainly
nicias
and
i
quite
approve
of
the
remark
which
lysimachus
made
about
his
own
father
and
the
father
of
melesias
and
which
is
applicable
not
only
to
them
but
to
us
and
to
every
one
who
is
occupied
with
public
affairs
as
he
says
such
persons
are
too
apt
to
be
negligent
and
careless
of
their
own
children
and
their
private
concerns
there
is
much
truth
in
that
remark
of
yours
lysimachus
but
why
instead
of
consulting
us
do
you
not
consult
our
friend
socrates
about
the
education
of
the
youths
he
is
of
the
same
deme
with
you
and
is
always
passing
his
time
in
places
where
the
youth
have
any
noble
study
or
pursuit
such
as
you
are
enquiring
after
lysimachus
why
laches
has
socrates
ever
attended
to
matters
of
this
sort
laches
certainly
lysimachus
nicias
that
i
have
the
means
of
knowing
as
well
as
laches
for
quite
lately
he
supplied
me
with
a
teacher
of
music
for
my
sons
damon
the
disciple
of
agathocles
who
is
a
most
accomplished
man
in
every
way
as
well
as
a
musician
and
a
companion
of
inestimable
value
for
young
men
at
their
age
lysimachus
those
who
have
reached
my
time
of
life
socrates
and
nicias
and
laches
fall
out
of
acquaintance
with
the
young
because
they
are
generally
detained
at
home
by
old
age
but
you
o
son
of
sophroniscus
should
let
your
fellow
demesman
have
the
benefit
of
any
advice
which
you
are
able
to
give
moreover
i
have
a
claim
upon
you
as
an
old
friend
of
your
father
for
i
and
he
were
always
companions
and
friends
and
to
the
hour
of
his
death
there
never
was
a
difference
between
us
and
now
it
comes
back
to
me
at
the
mention
of
your
name
that
i
have
heard
these
lads
talking
to
one
another
at
home
and
often
speaking
of
socrates
in
terms
of
the
highest
praise
but
i
have
never
thought
to
ask
them
whether
the
son
of
sophroniscus
was
the
person
whom
they
meant
tell
me
my
boys
whether
this
is
the
socrates
of
whom
you
have
often
spoken
son
certainly
father
this
is
he
lysimachus
i
am
delighted
to
hear
socrates
that
you
maintain
the
name
of
your
father
who
was
a
most
excellent
man
and
i
further
rejoice
at
the
prospect
of
our
family
ties
being
renewed
laches
indeed
lysimachus
you
ought
not
to
give
him
up
for
i
can
assure
you
that
i
have
seen
him
maintaining
not
only
his
father
but
also
his
country
name
he
was
my
companion
in
the
retreat
from
delium
and
i
can
tell
you
that
if
others
had
only
been
like
him
the
honour
of
our
country
would
have
been
upheld
and
the
great
defeat
would
never
have
occurred
lysimachus
that
is
very
high
praise
which
is
accorded
to
you
socrates
by
faithful
witnesses
and
for
actions
like
those
which
they
praise
let
me
tell
you
the
pleasure
which
i
feel
in
hearing
of
your
fame
and
i
hope
that
you
will
regard
me
as
one
of
your
warmest
friends
you
ought
to
have
visited
us
long
ago
and
made
yourself
at
home
with
us
but
now
from
this
day
forward
as
we
have
at
last
found
one
another
out
do
as
i
say
come
and
make
acquaintance
with
me
and
with
these
young
men
that
i
may
continue
your
friend
as
i
was
your
father
i
shall
expect
you
to
do
so
and
shall
venture
at
some
future
time
to
remind
you
of
your
duty
but
what
say
you
of
the
matter
of
which
we
were
beginning
to
speak
the
art
of
fighting
in
armour
is
that
a
practice
in
which
the
lads
may
be
advantageously
instructed
socrates
i
will
endeavour
to
advise
you
lysimachus
as
far
as
i
can
in
this
matter
and
also
in
every
way
will
comply
with
your
wishes
but
as
i
am
younger
and
not
so
experienced
i
think
that
i
ought
certainly
to
hear
first
what
my
elders
have
to
say
and
to
learn
of
them
and
if
i
have
anything
to
add
then
i
may
venture
to
give
my
opinion
to
them
as
well
as
to
you
suppose
nicias
that
one
or
other
of
you
begin
nicias
i
have
no
objection
socrates
and
my
opinion
is
that
the
acquirement
of
this
art
is
in
many
ways
useful
to
young
men
it
is
an
advantage
to
them
that
among
the
favourite
amusements
of
their
leisure
hours
they
should
have
one
which
tends
to
improve
and
not
to
injure
their
bodily
health
no
gymnastics
could
be
better
or
harder
exercise
and
this
and
the
art
of
riding
are
of
all
arts
most
befitting
to
a
freeman
for
they
only
who
are
thus
trained
in
the
use
of
arms
are
the
athletes
of
our
military
profession
trained
in
that
on
which
the
conflict
turns
moreover
in
actual
battle
when
you
have
to
fight
in
a
line
with
a
number
of
others
such
an
acquirement
will
be
of
some
use
and
will
be
of
the
greatest
whenever
the
ranks
are
broken
and
you
have
to
fight
singly
either
in
pursuit
when
you
are
attacking
some
one
who
is
defending
himself
or
in
flight
when
you
have
to
defend
yourself
against
an
assailant
certainly
he
who
possessed
the
art
could
not
meet
with
any
harm
at
the
hands
of
a
single
person
or
perhaps
of
several
and
in
any
case
he
would
have
a
great
advantage
further
this
sort
of
skill
inclines
a
man
to
the
love
of
other
noble
lessons
for
every
man
who
has
learned
how
to
fight
in
armour
will
desire
to
learn
the
proper
arrangement
of
an
army
which
is
the
sequel
of
the
lesson
and
when
he
has
learned
this
and
his
ambition
is
once
fired
he
will
go
on
to
learn
the
complete
art
of
the
general
there
is
no
difficulty
in
seeing
that
the
knowledge
and
practice
of
other
military
arts
will
be
honourable
and
valuable
to
a
man
and
this
lesson
may
be
the
beginning
of
them
let
me
add
a
further
advantage
which
is
by
no
means
a
slight
one
that
this
science
will
make
any
man
a
great
deal
more
valiant
and
in
the
field
and
i
will
not
disdain
to
mention
what
by
some
may
be
thought
to
be
a
small
matter
he
will
make
a
better
appearance
at
the
right
time
that
is
to
say
at
the
time
when
his
appearance
will
strike
terror
into
his
enemies
my
opinion
then
lysimachus
is
as
i
say
that
the
youths
should
be
instructed
in
this
art
and
for
the
reasons
which
i
have
given
but
laches
may
take
a
different
view
and
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
hear
what
he
has
to
say
laches
i
should
not
like
to
maintain
nicias
that
any
kind
of
knowledge
is
not
to
be
learned
for
all
knowledge
appears
to
be
a
good
and
if
as
nicias
and
as
the
teachers
of
the
art
affirm
this
use
of
arms
is
really
a
species
of
knowledge
then
it
ought
to
be
learned
but
if
not
and
if
those
who
profess
to
teach
it
are
deceivers
only
or
if
it
be
knowledge
but
not
of
a
valuable
sort
then
what
is
the
use
of
learning
it
i
say
this
because
i
think
that
if
it
had
been
really
valuable
the
lacedaemonians
whose
whole
life
is
passed
in
finding
out
and
practising
the
arts
which
give
them
an
advantage
over
other
nations
in
war
would
have
discovered
this
one
and
even
if
they
had
not
still
these
professors
of
the
art
would
certainly
not
have
failed
to
discover
that
of
all
the
hellenes
the
lacedaemonians
have
the
greatest
interest
in
such
matters
and
that
a
master
of
the
art
who
was
honoured
among
them
would
be
sure
to
make
his
fortune
among
other
nations
just
as
a
tragic
poet
would
who
is
honoured
among
ourselves
which
is
the
reason
why
he
who
fancies
that
he
can
write
a
tragedy
does
not
go
about
itinerating
in
the
neighbouring
states
but
rushes
hither
straight
and
exhibits
at
athens
and
this
is
natural
whereas
i
perceive
that
these
fighters
in
armour
regard
lacedaemon
as
a
sacred
inviolable
territory
which
they
do
not
touch
with
the
point
of
their
foot
but
they
make
a
circuit
of
the
neighbouring
states
and
would
rather
exhibit
to
any
others
than
to
the
spartans
and
particularly
to
those
who
would
themselves
acknowledge
that
they
are
by
no
means
in
the
arts
of
war
further
lysimachus
i
have
encountered
a
good
many
of
these
gentlemen
in
actual
service
and
have
taken
their
measure
which
i
can
give
you
at
once
for
none
of
these
masters
of
fence
have
ever
been
distinguished
in
war
there
has
been
a
sort
of
fatality
about
them
while
in
all
other
arts
the
men
of
note
have
been
always
those
who
have
practised
the
art
they
appear
to
be
a
most
unfortunate
exception
for
example
this
very
stesilaus
whom
you
and
i
have
just
witnessed
exhibiting
in
all
that
crowd
and
making
such
great
professions
of
his
powers
i
have
seen
at
another
time
making
in
sober
truth
an
involuntary
exhibition
of
himself
which
was
a
far
better
spectacle
he
was
a
marine
on
board
a
ship
which
struck
a
transport
vessel
and
was
armed
with
a
weapon
half
spear
half
scythe
the
singularity
of
this
weapon
was
worthy
of
the
singularity
of
the
man
to
make
a
long
story
short
i
will
only
tell
you
what
happened
to
this
notable
invention
of
the
scythe
spear
he
was
fighting
and
the
scythe
was
caught
in
the
rigging
of
the
other
ship
and
stuck
fast
and
he
tugged
but
was
unable
to
get
his
weapon
free
the
two
ships
were
passing
one
another
he
first
ran
along
his
own
ship
holding
on
to
the
spear
but
as
the
other
ship
passed
by
and
drew
him
after
as
he
was
holding
on
he
let
the
spear
slip
through
his
hand
until
he
retained
only
the
end
of
the
handle
the
people
in
the
transport
clapped
their
hands
and
laughed
at
his
ridiculous
figure
and
when
some
one
threw
a
stone
which
fell
on
the
deck
at
his
feet
and
he
quitted
his
hold
of
the
the
crew
of
his
own
trireme
also
burst
out
laughing
they
could
not
refrain
when
they
beheld
the
weapon
waving
in
the
air
suspended
from
the
transport
now
i
do
not
deny
that
there
may
be
something
in
such
an
art
as
nicias
asserts
but
i
tell
you
my
experience
and
as
i
said
at
first
whether
this
be
an
art
of
which
the
advantage
is
so
slight
or
not
an
art
at
all
but
only
an
imposition
in
either
case
such
an
acquirement
is
not
worth
having
for
my
opinion
is
that
if
the
professor
of
this
art
be
a
coward
he
will
be
likely
to
become
rash
and
his
character
will
be
only
more
notorious
or
if
he
be
brave
and
fail
ever
so
little
other
men
will
be
on
the
watch
and
he
will
be
greatly
traduced
for
there
is
a
jealousy
of
such
pretenders
and
unless
a
man
be
in
valour
he
can
not
help
being
ridiculous
if
he
says
that
he
has
this
sort
of
skill
such
is
my
judgment
lysimachus
of
the
desirableness
of
this
art
but
as
i
said
at
first
ask
socrates
and
do
not
let
him
go
until
he
has
given
you
his
opinion
of
the
matter
lysimachus
i
am
going
to
ask
this
favour
of
you
socrates
as
is
the
more
necessary
because
the
two
councillors
disagree
and
some
one
is
in
a
manner
still
needed
who
will
decide
between
them
had
they
agreed
no
arbiter
would
have
been
required
but
as
laches
has
voted
one
way
and
nicias
another
i
should
like
to
hear
with
which
of
our
two
friends
you
agree
socrates
what
lysimachus
are
you
going
to
accept
the
opinion
of
the
majority
lysimachus
why
yes
socrates
what
else
am
i
to
do
socrates
and
would
you
do
so
too
melesias
if
you
were
deliberating
about
the
gymnastic
training
of
your
son
would
you
follow
the
advice
of
the
majority
of
us
or
the
opinion
of
the
one
who
had
been
trained
and
exercised
under
a
skilful
master
melesias
the
latter
socrates
as
would
surely
be
reasonable
socrates
his
one
vote
would
be
worth
more
than
the
vote
of
all
us
four
melesias
certainly
socrates
and
for
this
reason
as
i
imagine
because
a
good
decision
is
based
on
knowledge
and
not
on
numbers
melesias
to
be
sure
socrates
must
we
not
then
first
of
all
ask
whether
there
is
any
one
of
us
who
has
knowledge
of
that
about
which
we
are
deliberating
if
there
is
let
us
take
his
advice
though
he
be
one
only
and
not
mind
the
rest
if
there
is
not
let
us
seek
further
counsel
is
this
a
slight
matter
about
which
you
and
lysimachus
are
deliberating
are
you
not
risking
the
greatest
of
your
possessions
for
children
are
your
riches
and
upon
their
turning
out
well
or
ill
depends
the
whole
order
of
their
father
house
melesias
that
is
true
socrates
great
care
then
is
required
in
this
matter
melesias
certainly
socrates
suppose
as
i
was
just
now
saying
that
we
were
considering
or
wanting
to
consider
who
was
the
best
trainer
should
we
not
select
him
who
knew
and
had
practised
the
art
and
had
the
best
teachers
melesias
i
think
that
we
should
socrates
but
would
there
not
arise
a
prior
question
about
the
nature
of
the
art
of
which
we
want
to
find
the
masters
melesias
i
do
not
understand
socrates
let
me
try
to
make
my
meaning
plainer
then
i
do
not
think
that
we
have
as
yet
decided
what
that
is
about
which
we
are
consulting
when
we
ask
which
of
us
is
or
is
not
skilled
in
the
art
and
has
or
has
not
had
a
teacher
of
the
art
nicias
why
socrates
is
not
the
question
whether
young
men
ought
or
ought
not
to
learn
the
art
of
fighting
in
armour
socrates
yes
nicias
but
there
is
also
a
prior
question
which
i
may
illustrate
in
this
way
when
a
person
considers
about
applying
a
medicine
to
the
eyes
would
you
say
that
he
is
consulting
about
the
medicine
or
about
the
eyes
nicias
about
the
eyes
socrates
and
when
he
considers
whether
he
shall
set
a
bridle
on
a
horse
and
at
what
time
he
is
thinking
of
the
horse
and
not
of
the
bridle
nicias
true
socrates
and
in
a
word
when
he
considers
anything
for
the
sake
of
another
thing
he
thinks
of
the
end
and
not
of
the
means
nicias
certainly
socrates
and
when
you
call
in
an
adviser
you
should
see
whether
he
too
is
skilful
in
the
accomplishment
of
the
end
which
you
have
in
view
nicias
most
true
socrates
and
at
present
we
have
in
view
some
knowledge
of
which
the
end
is
the
soul
of
youth
nicias
yes
socrates
and
we
are
enquiring
which
of
us
is
skilful
or
successful
in
the
treatment
of
the
soul
and
which
of
us
has
had
good
teachers
laches
well
but
socrates
did
you
never
observe
that
some
persons
who
have
had
no
teachers
are
more
skilful
than
those
who
have
in
some
things
socrates
yes
laches
i
have
observed
that
but
you
would
not
be
very
willing
to
trust
them
if
they
only
professed
to
be
masters
of
their
art
unless
they
could
show
some
proof
of
their
skill
or
excellence
in
one
or
more
works
laches
that
is
true
socrates
and
therefore
laches
and
nicias
as
lysimachus
and
melesias
in
their
anxiety
to
improve
the
minds
of
their
sons
have
asked
our
advice
about
them
we
too
should
tell
them
who
our
teachers
were
if
we
say
that
we
have
had
any
and
prove
them
to
be
in
the
first
place
men
of
merit
and
experienced
trainers
of
the
minds
of
youth
and
also
to
have
been
really
our
teachers
or
if
any
of
us
says
that
he
has
no
teacher
but
that
he
has
works
of
his
own
to
show
then
he
should
point
out
to
them
what
athenians
or
strangers
bond
or
free
he
is
generally
acknowledged
to
have
improved
but
if
he
can
show
neither
teachers
nor
works
then
he
should
tell
them
to
look
out
for
others
and
not
run
the
risk
of
spoiling
the
children
of
friends
and
thereby
incurring
the
most
formidable
accusation
which
can
be
brought
against
any
one
by
those
nearest
to
him
as
for
myself
lysimachus
and
melesias
i
am
the
first
to
confess
that
i
have
never
had
a
teacher
of
the
art
of
virtue
although
i
have
always
from
my
earliest
youth
desired
to
have
one
but
i
am
too
poor
to
give
money
to
the
sophists
who
are
the
only
professors
of
moral
improvement
and
to
this
day
i
have
never
been
able
to
discover
the
art
myself
though
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
nicias
or
laches
may
have
discovered
or
learned
it
for
they
are
far
wealthier
than
i
am
and
may
therefore
have
learnt
of
others
and
they
are
older
too
so
that
they
have
had
more
time
to
make
the
discovery
and
i
really
believe
that
they
are
able
to
educate
a
man
for
unless
they
had
been
confident
in
their
own
knowledge
they
would
never
have
spoken
thus
decidedly
of
the
pursuits
which
are
advantageous
or
hurtful
to
a
young
man
i
repose
confidence
in
both
of
them
but
i
am
surprised
to
find
that
they
differ
from
one
another
and
therefore
lysimachus
as
laches
suggested
that
you
should
detain
me
and
not
let
me
go
until
i
answered
i
in
turn
earnestly
beseech
and
advise
you
to
detain
laches
and
nicias
and
question
them
i
would
have
you
say
to
them
socrates
avers
that
he
has
no
knowledge
of
the
matter
he
is
unable
to
decide
which
of
you
speaks
truly
neither
discoverer
nor
student
is
he
of
anything
of
the
kind
but
you
laches
and
nicias
should
each
of
you
tell
us
who
is
the
most
skilful
educator
whom
you
have
ever
known
and
whether
you
invented
the
art
yourselves
or
learned
of
another
and
if
you
learned
who
were
your
respective
teachers
and
who
were
their
brothers
in
the
art
and
then
if
you
are
too
much
occupied
in
politics
to
teach
us
yourselves
let
us
go
to
them
and
present
them
with
gifts
or
make
interest
with
them
or
both
in
the
hope
that
they
may
be
induced
to
take
charge
of
our
children
and
of
yours
and
then
they
will
not
grow
up
inferior
and
disgrace
their
ancestors
but
if
you
are
yourselves
original
discoverers
in
that
field
give
us
some
proof
of
your
skill
who
are
they
who
having
been
inferior
persons
have
become
under
your
care
good
and
noble
for
if
this
is
your
first
attempt
at
education
there
is
a
danger
that
you
may
be
trying
the
experiment
not
on
the
corpus
of
a
carian
slave
but
on
your
own
sons
or
the
sons
of
your
friend
and
as
the
proverb
says
the
large
vessel
in
learning
to
make
pots
tell
us
then
what
qualities
you
claim
or
do
not
claim
make
them
tell
you
that
lysimachus
and
do
not
let
them
off
lysimachus
i
very
much
approve
of
the
words
of
socrates
my
friends
but
you
nicias
and
laches
must
determine
whether
you
will
be
questioned
and
give
an
explanation
about
matters
of
this
sort
assuredly
i
and
melesias
would
be
greatly
pleased
to
hear
you
answer
the
questions
which
socrates
asks
if
you
will
for
i
began
by
saying
that
we
took
you
into
our
counsels
because
we
thought
that
you
would
have
attended
to
the
subject
especially
as
you
have
children
who
like
our
own
are
nearly
of
an
age
to
be
educated
well
then
if
you
have
no
objection
suppose
that
you
take
socrates
into
partnership
and
do
you
and
he
ask
and
answer
one
another
questions
for
as
he
has
well
said
we
are
deliberating
about
the
most
important
of
our
concerns
i
hope
that
you
will
see
fit
to
comply
with
our
request
nicias
i
see
very
clearly
lysimachus
that
you
have
only
known
socrates
father
and
have
no
acquaintance
with
socrates
himself
at
least
you
can
only
have
known
him
when
he
was
a
child
and
may
have
met
him
among
his
in
company
with
his
father
at
a
sacrifice
or
at
some
other
gathering
you
clearly
show
that
you
have
never
known
him
since
he
arrived
at
manhood
lysimachus
why
do
you
say
that
nicias
nicias
because
you
seem
not
to
be
aware
that
any
one
who
has
an
intellectual
affinity
to
socrates
and
enters
into
conversation
with
him
is
liable
to
be
drawn
into
an
argument
and
whatever
subject
he
may
start
he
will
be
continually
carried
round
and
round
by
him
until
at
last
he
finds
that
he
has
to
give
an
account
both
of
his
present
and
past
life
and
when
he
is
once
entangled
socrates
will
not
let
him
go
until
he
has
completely
and
thoroughly
sifted
him
now
i
am
used
to
his
ways
and
i
know
that
he
will
certainly
do
as
i
say
and
also
that
i
myself
shall
be
the
sufferer
for
i
am
fond
of
his
conversation
lysimachus
and
i
think
that
there
is
no
harm
in
being
reminded
of
any
wrong
thing
which
we
are
or
have
been
doing
he
who
does
not
fly
from
reproof
will
be
sure
to
take
more
heed
of
his
as
solon
says
he
will
wish
and
desire
to
be
learning
so
long
as
he
lives
and
will
not
think
that
old
age
of
itself
brings
wisdom
to
me
to
be
by
socrates
is
neither
unusual
nor
unpleasant
indeed
i
knew
all
along
that
where
socrates
was
the
argument
would
soon
pass
from
our
sons
to
ourselves
and
therefore
i
say
that
for
my
part
i
am
quite
willing
to
discourse
with
socrates
in
his
own
manner
but
you
had
better
ask
our
friend
laches
what
his
feeling
may
be
laches
i
have
but
one
feeling
nicias
or
shall
i
say
two
feelings
about
discussions
some
would
think
that
i
am
a
lover
and
to
others
i
may
seem
to
be
a
hater
of
discourse
for
when
i
hear
a
man
discoursing
of
virtue
or
of
any
sort
of
wisdom
who
is
a
true
man
and
worthy
of
his
theme
i
am
delighted
beyond
measure
and
i
compare
the
man
and
his
words
and
note
the
harmony
and
correspondence
of
them
and
such
an
one
i
deem
to
be
the
true
musician
attuned
to
a
fairer
harmony
than
that
of
the
lyre
or
any
pleasant
instrument
of
music
for
truly
he
has
in
his
own
life
a
harmony
of
words
and
deeds
arranged
not
in
the
ionian
or
in
the
phrygian
mode
nor
yet
in
the
lydian
but
in
the
true
hellenic
mode
which
is
the
dorian
and
no
other
such
an
one
makes
me
merry
with
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
when
i
hear
him
i
am
thought
to
be
a
lover
of
discourse
so
eager
am
i
in
drinking
in
his
words
but
a
man
whose
actions
do
not
agree
with
his
words
is
an
annoyance
to
me
and
the
better
he
speaks
the
more
i
hate
him
and
then
i
seem
to
be
a
hater
of
discourse
as
to
socrates
i
have
no
knowledge
of
his
words
but
of
old
as
would
seem
i
have
had
experience
of
his
deeds
and
his
deeds
show
that
free
and
noble
sentiments
are
natural
to
him
and
if
his
words
accord
then
i
am
of
one
mind
with
him
and
shall
be
delighted
to
be
interrogated
by
a
man
such
as
he
is
and
shall
not
be
annoyed
at
having
to
learn
of
him
for
i
too
agree
with
solon
i
would
fain
grow
old
learning
many
things
but
i
must
be
allowed
to
add
the
good
only
socrates
must
be
willing
to
allow
that
he
is
a
good
teacher
or
i
shall
be
a
dull
and
uncongenial
pupil
but
that
the
teacher
is
younger
or
not
as
yet
in
repute
anything
of
that
sort
is
of
no
account
with
me
and
therefore
socrates
i
give
you
notice
that
you
may
teach
and
confute
me
as
much
as
ever
you
like
and
also
learn
of
me
anything
which
i
know
so
high
is
the
opinion
which
i
have
entertained
of
you
ever
since
the
day
on
which
you
were
my
companion
in
danger
and
gave
a
proof
of
your
valour
such
as
only
the
man
of
merit
can
give
therefore
say
whatever
you
like
and
do
not
mind
about
the
difference
of
our
ages
socrates
i
can
not
say
that
either
of
you
show
any
reluctance
to
take
counsel
and
advise
with
me
lysimachus
but
this
is
our
proper
business
and
yours
as
well
as
ours
for
i
reckon
you
as
one
of
us
please
then
to
take
my
place
and
find
out
from
nicias
and
laches
what
we
want
to
know
for
the
sake
of
the
youths
and
talk
and
consult
with
them
for
i
am
old
and
my
memory
is
bad
and
i
do
not
remember
the
questions
which
i
am
going
to
ask
or
the
answers
to
them
and
if
there
is
any
interruption
i
am
quite
lost
i
will
therefore
beg
of
you
to
carry
on
the
proposed
discussion
by
your
selves
and
i
will
listen
and
melesias
and
i
will
act
upon
your
conclusions
socrates
let
us
nicias
and
laches
comply
with
the
request
of
lysimachus
and
melesias
there
will
be
no
harm
in
asking
ourselves
the
question
which
was
first
proposed
to
us
have
been
our
own
instructors
in
this
sort
of
training
and
whom
have
we
made
better
but
the
other
mode
of
carrying
on
the
enquiry
will
bring
us
equally
to
the
same
point
and
will
be
more
like
proceeding
from
first
principles
for
if
we
knew
that
the
addition
of
something
would
improve
some
other
thing
and
were
able
to
make
the
addition
then
clearly
we
must
know
how
that
about
which
we
are
advising
may
be
best
and
most
easily
attained
perhaps
you
do
not
understand
what
i
mean
then
let
me
make
my
meaning
plainer
in
this
way
suppose
we
knew
that
the
addition
of
sight
makes
better
the
eyes
which
possess
this
gift
and
also
were
able
to
impart
sight
to
the
eyes
then
clearly
we
should
know
the
nature
of
sight
and
should
be
able
to
advise
how
this
gift
of
sight
may
be
best
and
most
easily
attained
but
if
we
knew
neither
what
sight
is
nor
what
hearing
is
we
should
not
be
very
good
medical
advisers
about
the
eyes
or
the
ears
or
about
the
best
mode
of
giving
sight
and
hearing
to
them
laches
that
is
true
socrates
socrates
and
are
not
our
two
friends
laches
at
this
very
moment
inviting
us
to
consider
in
what
way
the
gift
of
virtue
may
be
imparted
to
their
sons
for
the
improvement
of
their
minds
laches
very
true
socrates
then
must
we
not
first
know
the
nature
of
virtue
for
how
can
we
advise
any
one
about
the
best
mode
of
attaining
something
of
which
we
are
wholly
ignorant
laches
i
do
not
think
that
we
can
socrates
socrates
then
laches
we
may
presume
that
we
know
the
nature
of
virtue
laches
yes
socrates
and
that
which
we
know
we
must
surely
be
able
to
tell
laches
certainly
socrates
i
would
not
have
us
begin
my
friend
with
enquiring
about
the
whole
of
virtue
for
that
may
be
more
than
we
can
accomplish
let
us
first
consider
whether
we
have
a
sufficient
knowledge
of
a
part
the
enquiry
will
thus
probably
be
made
easier
to
us
laches
let
us
do
as
you
say
socrates
socrates
then
which
of
the
parts
of
virtue
shall
we
select
must
we
not
select
that
to
which
the
art
of
fighting
in
armour
is
supposed
to
conduce
and
is
not
that
generally
thought
to
be
courage
laches
yes
certainly
socrates
then
laches
suppose
that
we
first
set
about
determining
the
nature
of
courage
and
in
the
second
place
proceed
to
enquire
how
the
young
men
may
attain
this
quality
by
the
help
of
studies
and
pursuits
tell
me
if
you
can
what
is
courage
laches
indeed
socrates
i
see
no
difficulty
in
answering
he
is
a
man
of
courage
who
does
not
run
away
but
remains
at
his
post
and
fights
against
the
enemy
there
can
be
no
mistake
about
that
socrates
very
good
laches
and
yet
i
fear
that
i
did
not
express
myself
clearly
and
therefore
you
have
answered
not
the
question
which
i
intended
to
ask
but
another
laches
what
do
you
mean
socrates
socrates
i
will
endeavour
to
explain
you
would
call
a
man
courageous
who
remains
at
his
post
and
fights
with
the
enemy
laches
certainly
i
should
socrates
and
so
should
i
but
what
would
you
say
of
another
man
who
fights
flying
instead
of
remaining
laches
how
flying
socrates
why
as
the
scythians
are
said
to
fight
flying
as
well
as
pursuing
and
as
homer
says
in
praise
of
the
horses
of
aeneas
that
they
knew
to
pursue
and
fly
quickly
hither
and
thither
and
he
passes
an
encomium
on
aeneas
himself
as
having
a
knowledge
of
fear
or
flight
and
calls
him
author
of
fear
or
flight
laches
yes
socrates
and
there
homer
is
right
for
he
was
speaking
of
chariots
as
you
were
speaking
of
the
scythian
cavalry
who
have
that
way
of
fighting
but
the
greek
fights
as
i
say
remaining
in
his
rank
socrates
and
yet
laches
you
must
except
the
lacedaemonians
at
plataea
who
when
they
came
upon
the
light
shields
of
the
persians
are
said
not
to
have
been
willing
to
stand
and
fight
and
to
have
fled
but
when
the
ranks
of
the
persians
were
broken
they
turned
upon
them
like
cavalry
and
won
the
battle
of
plataea
laches
that
is
true
socrates
that
was
my
meaning
when
i
said
that
i
was
to
blame
in
having
put
my
question
badly
and
that
this
was
the
reason
of
your
answering
badly
for
i
meant
to
ask
you
not
only
about
the
courage
of
soldiers
but
about
the
courage
of
cavalry
and
every
other
style
of
soldier
and
not
only
who
are
courageous
in
war
but
who
are
courageous
in
perils
by
sea
and
who
in
disease
or
in
poverty
or
again
in
politics
are
courageous
and
not
only
who
are
courageous
against
pain
or
fear
but
mighty
to
contend
against
desires
and
pleasures
either
fixed
in
their
rank
or
turning
upon
their
enemy
there
is
this
sort
of
courage
is
there
not
laches
laches
certainly
socrates
socrates
and
all
these
are
courageous
but
some
have
courage
in
pleasures
and
some
in
pains
some
in
desires
and
some
in
fears
and
some
are
cowards
under
the
same
conditions
as
i
should
imagine
laches
very
true
socrates
now
i
was
asking
about
courage
and
cowardice
in
general
and
i
will
begin
with
courage
and
once
more
ask
what
is
that
common
quality
which
is
the
same
in
all
these
cases
and
which
is
called
courage
do
you
now
understand
what
i
mean
laches
not
over
well
socrates
i
mean
this
as
i
might
ask
what
is
that
quality
which
is
called
quickness
and
which
is
found
in
running
in
playing
the
lyre
in
speaking
in
learning
and
in
many
other
similar
actions
or
rather
which
we
possess
in
nearly
every
action
that
is
worth
mentioning
of
arms
legs
mouth
voice
mind
would
you
not
apply
the
term
quickness
to
all
of
them
laches
quite
true
socrates
and
suppose
i
were
to
be
asked
by
some
one
what
is
that
common
quality
socrates
which
in
all
these
uses
of
the
word
you
call
quickness
i
should
say
the
quality
which
accomplishes
much
in
a
little
time
whether
in
running
speaking
or
in
any
other
sort
of
action
laches
you
would
be
quite
correct
socrates
and
now
laches
do
you
try
and
tell
me
in
like
manner
what
is
that
common
quality
which
is
called
courage
and
which
includes
all
the
various
uses
of
the
term
when
applied
both
to
pleasure
and
pain
and
in
all
the
cases
to
which
i
was
just
now
referring
laches
i
should
say
that
courage
is
a
sort
of
endurance
of
the
soul
if
i
am
to
speak
of
the
universal
nature
which
pervades
them
all
socrates
but
that
is
what
we
must
do
if
we
are
to
answer
the
question
and
yet
i
can
not
say
that
every
kind
of
endurance
is
in
my
opinion
to
be
deemed
courage
hear
my
reason
i
am
sure
laches
that
you
would
consider
courage
to
be
a
very
noble
quality
laches
most
noble
certainly
socrates
and
you
would
say
that
a
wise
endurance
is
also
good
and
noble
laches
very
noble
socrates
but
what
would
you
say
of
a
foolish
endurance
is
not
that
on
the
other
hand
to
be
regarded
as
evil
and
hurtful
laches
true
socrates
and
is
anything
noble
which
is
evil
and
hurtful
laches
i
ought
not
to
say
that
socrates
socrates
then
you
would
not
admit
that
sort
of
endurance
to
be
courage
for
it
is
not
noble
but
courage
is
noble
laches
you
are
right
socrates
then
according
to
you
only
the
wise
endurance
is
courage
laches
true
socrates
but
as
to
the
epithet
wise
in
what
in
all
things
small
as
well
as
great
for
example
if
a
man
shows
the
quality
of
endurance
in
spending
his
money
wisely
knowing
that
by
spending
he
will
acquire
more
in
the
end
do
you
call
him
courageous
laches
assuredly
not
socrates
or
for
example
if
a
man
is
a
physician
and
his
son
or
some
patient
of
his
has
inflammation
of
the
lungs
and
begs
that
he
may
be
allowed
to
eat
or
drink
something
and
the
other
is
firm
and
refuses
is
that
courage
laches
no
that
is
not
courage
at
all
any
more
than
the
last
socrates
again
take
the
case
of
one
who
endures
in
war
and
is
willing
to
fight
and
wisely
calculates
and
knows
that
others
will
help
him
and
that
there
will
be
fewer
and
inferior
men
against
him
than
there
are
with
him
and
suppose
that
he
has
also
advantages
of
position
would
you
say
of
such
a
one
who
endures
with
all
this
wisdom
and
preparation
that
he
or
some
man
in
the
opposing
army
who
is
in
the
opposite
circumstances
to
these
and
yet
endures
and
remains
at
his
post
is
the
braver
laches
i
should
say
that
the
latter
socrates
was
the
braver
socrates
but
surely
this
is
a
foolish
endurance
in
comparison
with
the
other
laches
that
is
true
socrates
then
you
would
say
that
he
who
in
an
engagement
of
cavalry
endures
having
the
knowledge
of
horsemanship
is
not
so
courageous
as
he
who
endures
having
no
such
knowledge
laches
so
i
should
say
socrates
and
he
who
endures
having
a
knowledge
of
the
use
of
the
sling
or
the
bow
or
of
any
other
art
is
not
so
courageous
as
he
who
endures
not
having
such
a
knowledge
laches
true
socrates
and
he
who
descends
into
a
well
and
dives
and
holds
out
in
this
or
any
similar
action
having
no
knowledge
of
diving
or
the
like
is
as
you
would
say
more
courageous
than
those
who
have
this
knowledge
laches
why
socrates
what
else
can
a
man
say
socrates
nothing
if
that
be
what
he
thinks
laches
but
that
is
what
i
do
think
socrates
and
yet
men
who
thus
run
risks
and
endure
are
foolish
laches
in
comparison
of
those
who
do
the
same
things
having
the
skill
to
do
them
laches
that
is
true
socrates
but
foolish
boldness
and
endurance
appeared
before
to
be
base
and
hurtful
to
us
laches
quite
true
socrates
whereas
courage
was
acknowledged
to
be
a
noble
quality
laches
true
socrates
and
now
on
the
contrary
we
are
saying
that
the
foolish
endurance
which
was
before
held
in
dishonour
is
courage
laches
very
true
socrates
and
are
we
right
in
saying
so
laches
indeed
socrates
i
am
sure
that
we
are
not
right
socrates
then
according
to
your
statement
you
and
i
laches
are
not
attuned
to
the
dorian
mode
which
is
a
harmony
of
words
and
deeds
for
our
deeds
are
not
in
accordance
with
our
words
any
one
would
say
that
we
had
courage
who
saw
us
in
action
but
not
i
imagine
he
who
heard
us
talking
about
courage
just
now
laches
that
is
most
true
socrates
and
is
this
condition
of
ours
satisfactory
laches
quite
the
reverse
socrates
suppose
however
that
we
admit
the
principle
of
which
we
are
speaking
to
a
certain
extent
laches
to
what
extent
and
what
principle
do
you
mean
socrates
the
principle
of
endurance
we
too
must
endure
and
persevere
in
the
enquiry
and
then
courage
will
not
laugh
at
our
in
searching
for
courage
which
after
all
may
very
likely
be
endurance
laches
i
am
ready
to
go
on
socrates
and
yet
i
am
unused
to
investigations
of
this
sort
but
the
spirit
of
controversy
has
been
aroused
in
me
by
what
has
been
said
and
i
am
really
grieved
at
being
thus
unable
to
express
my
meaning
for
i
fancy
that
i
do
know
the
nature
of
courage
but
somehow
or
other
she
has
slipped
away
from
me
and
i
can
not
get
hold
of
her
and
tell
her
nature
socrates
but
my
dear
friend
should
not
the
good
sportsman
follow
the
track
and
not
be
lazy
laches
certainly
he
should
socrates
and
shall
we
invite
nicias
to
join
us
he
may
be
better
at
the
sport
than
we
are
what
do
you
say
laches
i
should
like
that
socrates
come
then
nicias
and
do
what
you
can
to
help
your
friends
who
are
tossing
on
the
waves
of
argument
and
at
the
last
gasp
you
see
our
extremity
and
may
save
us
and
also
settle
your
own
opinion
if
you
will
tell
us
what
you
think
about
courage
nicias
i
have
been
thinking
socrates
that
you
and
laches
are
not
defining
courage
in
the
right
way
for
you
have
forgotten
an
excellent
saying
which
i
have
heard
from
your
own
lips
socrates
what
is
it
nicias
nicias
i
have
often
heard
you
say
that
man
is
good
in
that
in
which
he
is
wise
and
bad
in
that
in
which
he
is
unwise
socrates
that
is
certainly
true
nicias
nicias
and
therefore
if
the
brave
man
is
good
he
is
also
wise
socrates
do
you
hear
him
laches
laches
yes
i
hear
him
but
i
do
not
very
well
understand
him
socrates
i
think
that
i
understand
him
and
he
appears
to
me
to
mean
that
courage
is
a
sort
of
wisdom
laches
what
can
he
possibly
mean
socrates
socrates
that
is
a
question
which
you
must
ask
of
himself
laches
yes
socrates
tell
him
then
nicias
what
you
mean
by
this
wisdom
for
you
surely
do
not
mean
the
wisdom
which
plays
the
flute
nicias
certainly
not
socrates
nor
the
wisdom
which
plays
the
lyre
nicias
no
socrates
but
what
is
this
knowledge
then
and
of
what
laches
i
think
that
you
put
the
question
to
him
very
well
socrates
and
i
would
like
him
to
say
what
is
the
nature
of
this
knowledge
or
wisdom
nicias
i
mean
to
say
laches
that
courage
is
the
knowledge
of
that
which
inspires
fear
or
confidence
in
war
or
in
anything
laches
how
strangely
he
is
talking
socrates
socrates
why
do
you
say
so
laches
laches
why
surely
courage
is
one
thing
and
wisdom
another
socrates
that
is
just
what
nicias
denies
laches
yes
that
is
what
he
denies
but
he
is
so
silly
socrates
suppose
that
we
instruct
instead
of
abusing
him
nicias
laches
does
not
want
to
instruct
me
socrates
but
having
been
proved
to
be
talking
nonsense
himself
he
wants
to
prove
that
i
have
been
doing
the
same
laches
very
true
nicias
and
you
are
talking
nonsense
as
i
shall
endeavour
to
show
let
me
ask
you
a
question
do
not
physicians
know
the
dangers
of
disease
or
do
the
courageous
know
them
or
are
the
physicians
the
same
as
the
courageous
nicias
not
at
all
laches
no
more
than
the
husbandmen
who
know
the
dangers
of
husbandry
or
than
other
craftsmen
who
have
a
knowledge
of
that
which
inspires
them
with
fear
or
confidence
in
their
own
arts
and
yet
they
are
not
courageous
a
whit
the
more
for
that
socrates
what
is
laches
saying
nicias
he
appears
to
be
saying
something
of
importance
nicias
yes
he
is
saying
something
but
it
is
not
true
socrates
how
so
nicias
why
because
he
does
not
see
that
the
physician
knowledge
only
extends
to
the
nature
of
health
and
disease
he
can
tell
the
sick
man
no
more
than
this
do
you
imagine
laches
that
the
physician
knows
whether
health
or
disease
is
the
more
terrible
to
a
man
had
not
many
a
man
better
never
get
up
from
a
sick
bed
i
should
like
to
know
whether
you
think
that
life
is
always
better
than
death
may
not
death
often
be
the
better
of
the
two
laches
yes
certainly
so
in
my
opinion
nicias
and
do
you
think
that
the
same
things
are
terrible
to
those
who
had
better
die
and
to
those
who
had
better
live
laches
certainly
not
nicias
and
do
you
suppose
that
the
physician
or
any
other
artist
knows
this
or
any
one
indeed
except
he
who
is
skilled
in
the
grounds
of
fear
and
hope
and
him
i
call
the
courageous
socrates
do
you
understand
his
meaning
laches
laches
yes
i
suppose
that
in
his
way
of
speaking
the
soothsayers
are
courageous
for
who
but
one
of
them
can
know
to
whom
to
die
or
to
live
is
better
and
yet
nicias
would
you
allow
that
you
are
yourself
a
soothsayer
or
are
you
neither
a
soothsayer
nor
courageous
nicias
what
do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
soothsayer
ought
to
know
the
grounds
of
hope
or
fear
laches
indeed
i
do
who
but
he
nicias
much
rather
i
should
say
he
of
whom
i
speak
for
the
soothsayer
ought
to
know
only
the
signs
of
things
that
are
about
to
come
to
pass
whether
death
or
disease
or
loss
of
property
or
victory
or
defeat
in
war
or
in
any
sort
of
contest
but
to
whom
the
suffering
or
not
suffering
of
these
things
will
be
for
the
best
can
no
more
be
decided
by
the
soothsayer
than
by
one
who
is
no
soothsayer
laches
i
can
not
understand
what
nicias
would
be
at
socrates
for
he
represents
the
courageous
man
as
neither
a
soothsayer
nor
a
physician
nor
in
any
other
character
unless
he
means
to
say
that
he
is
a
god
my
opinion
is
that
he
does
not
like
honestly
to
confess
that
he
is
talking
nonsense
but
that
he
shuffles
up
and
down
in
order
to
conceal
the
difficulty
into
which
he
has
got
himself
you
and
i
socrates
might
have
practised
a
similar
shuffle
just
now
if
we
had
only
wanted
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
inconsistency
and
if
we
had
been
arguing
in
a
court
of
law
there
might
have
been
reason
in
so
doing
but
why
should
a
man
deck
himself
out
with
vain
words
at
a
meeting
of
friends
such
as
this
socrates
i
quite
agree
with
you
laches
that
he
should
not
but
perhaps
nicias
is
serious
and
not
merely
talking
for
the
sake
of
talking
let
us
ask
him
just
to
explain
what
he
means
and
if
he
has
reason
on
his
side
we
will
agree
with
him
if
not
we
will
instruct
him
laches
do
you
socrates
if
you
like
ask
him
i
think
that
i
have
asked
enough
socrates
i
do
not
see
why
i
should
not
and
my
question
will
do
for
both
of
us
laches
very
good
socrates
then
tell
me
nicias
or
rather
tell
us
for
laches
and
i
are
partners
in
the
argument
do
you
mean
to
affirm
that
courage
is
the
knowledge
of
the
grounds
of
hope
and
fear
nicias
i
do
socrates
and
not
every
man
has
this
knowledge
the
physician
and
the
soothsayer
have
it
not
and
they
will
not
be
courageous
unless
they
acquire
it
that
is
what
you
were
saying
nicias
i
was
socrates
then
this
is
certainly
not
a
thing
which
every
pig
would
know
as
the
proverb
says
and
therefore
he
could
not
be
courageous
nicias
i
think
not
socrates
clearly
not
nicias
not
even
such
a
big
pig
as
the
crommyonian
sow
would
be
called
by
you
courageous
and
this
i
say
not
as
a
joke
but
because
i
think
that
he
who
assents
to
your
doctrine
that
courage
is
the
knowledge
of
the
grounds
of
fear
and
hope
can
not
allow
that
any
wild
beast
is
courageous
unless
he
admits
that
a
lion
or
a
leopard
or
perhaps
a
boar
or
any
other
animal
has
such
a
degree
of
wisdom
that
he
knows
things
which
but
a
few
human
beings
ever
know
by
reason
of
their
difficulty
he
who
takes
your
view
of
courage
must
affirm
that
a
lion
and
a
stag
and
a
bull
and
a
monkey
have
equally
little
pretensions
to
courage
laches
capital
socrates
by
the
gods
that
is
truly
good
and
i
hope
nicias
that
you
will
tell
us
whether
these
animals
which
we
all
admit
to
be
courageous
are
really
wiser
than
mankind
or
whether
you
will
have
the
boldness
in
the
face
of
universal
opinion
to
deny
their
courage
nicias
why
laches
i
do
not
call
animals
or
any
other
things
which
have
no
fear
of
dangers
because
they
are
ignorant
of
them
courageous
but
only
fearless
and
senseless
do
you
imagine
that
i
should
call
little
children
courageous
which
fear
no
dangers
because
they
know
none
there
is
a
difference
to
my
way
of
thinking
between
fearlessness
and
courage
i
am
of
opinion
that
thoughtful
courage
is
a
quality
possessed
by
very
few
but
that
rashness
and
boldness
and
fearlessness
which
has
no
forethought
are
very
common
qualities
possessed
by
many
men
many
women
many
children
many
animals
and
you
and
men
in
general
call
by
the
term
actions
which
i
call
rash
my
courageous
actions
are
wise
actions
laches
behold
socrates
how
admirably
as
he
thinks
he
dresses
himself
out
in
words
while
seeking
to
deprive
of
the
honour
of
courage
those
whom
all
the
world
acknowledges
to
be
courageous
nicias
not
so
laches
but
do
not
be
alarmed
for
i
am
quite
willing
to
say
of
you
and
also
of
lamachus
and
of
many
other
athenians
that
you
are
courageous
and
therefore
wise
laches
i
could
answer
that
but
i
would
not
have
you
cast
in
my
teeth
that
i
am
a
haughty
aexonian
socrates
do
not
answer
him
laches
i
rather
fancy
that
you
are
not
aware
of
the
source
from
which
his
wisdom
is
derived
he
has
got
all
this
from
my
friend
damon
and
damon
is
always
with
prodicus
who
of
all
the
sophists
is
considered
to
be
the
best
puller
to
pieces
of
words
of
this
sort
laches
yes
socrates
and
the
examination
of
such
niceties
is
a
much
more
suitable
employment
for
a
sophist
than
for
a
great
statesman
whom
the
city
chooses
to
preside
over
her
socrates
yes
my
sweet
friend
but
a
great
statesman
is
likely
to
have
a
great
intelligence
and
i
think
that
the
view
which
is
implied
in
nicias
definition
of
courage
is
worthy
of
examination
laches
then
examine
for
yourself
socrates
socrates
that
is
what
i
am
going
to
do
my
dear
friend
do
not
however
suppose
i
shall
let
you
out
of
the
partnership
for
i
shall
expect
you
to
apply
your
mind
and
join
with
me
in
the
consideration
of
the
question
laches
i
will
if
you
think
that
i
ought
socrates
yes
i
do
but
i
must
beg
of
you
nicias
to
begin
again
you
remember
that
we
originally
considered
courage
to
be
a
part
of
virtue
nicias
very
true
socrates
and
you
yourself
said
that
it
was
a
part
and
there
were
many
other
parts
all
of
which
taken
together
are
called
virtue
nicias
certainly
socrates
do
you
agree
with
me
about
the
parts
for
i
say
that
justice
temperance
and
the
like
are
all
of
them
parts
of
virtue
as
well
as
courage
would
you
not
say
the
same
nicias
certainly
socrates
well
then
so
far
we
are
agreed
and
now
let
us
proceed
a
step
and
try
to
arrive
at
a
similar
agreement
about
the
fearful
and
the
hopeful
i
do
not
want
you
to
be
thinking
one
thing
and
myself
another
let
me
then
tell
you
my
own
opinion
and
if
i
am
wrong
you
shall
set
me
right
in
my
opinion
the
terrible
and
the
hopeful
are
the
things
which
do
or
do
not
create
fear
and
fear
is
not
of
the
present
nor
of
the
past
but
is
of
future
and
expected
evil
do
you
not
agree
to
that
laches
laches
yes
socrates
entirely
socrates
that
is
my
view
nicias
the
terrible
things
as
i
should
say
are
the
evils
which
are
future
and
the
hopeful
are
the
good
or
not
evil
things
which
are
future
do
you
or
do
you
not
agree
with
me
nicias
i
agree
socrates
and
the
knowledge
of
these
things
you
call
courage
nicias
precisely
socrates
and
now
let
me
see
whether
you
agree
with
laches
and
myself
as
to
a
third
point
nicias
what
is
that
socrates
i
will
tell
you
he
and
i
have
a
notion
that
there
is
not
one
knowledge
or
science
of
the
past
another
of
the
present
a
third
of
what
is
likely
to
be
best
and
what
will
be
best
in
the
future
but
that
of
all
three
there
is
one
science
only
for
example
there
is
one
science
of
medicine
which
is
concerned
with
the
inspection
of
health
equally
in
all
times
present
past
and
future
and
one
science
of
husbandry
in
like
manner
which
is
concerned
with
the
productions
of
the
earth
in
all
times
as
to
the
art
of
the
general
you
yourselves
will
be
my
witnesses
that
he
has
an
excellent
foreknowledge
of
the
future
and
that
he
claims
to
be
the
master
and
not
the
servant
of
the
soothsayer
because
he
knows
better
what
is
happening
or
is
likely
to
happen
in
war
and
accordingly
the
law
places
the
soothsayer
under
the
general
and
not
the
general
under
the
soothsayer
am
i
not
correct
in
saying
so
laches
laches
quite
correct
socrates
and
do
you
nicias
also
acknowledge
that
the
same
science
has
understanding
of
the
same
things
whether
future
present
or
past
nicias
yes
indeed
socrates
that
is
my
opinion
socrates
and
courage
my
friend
is
as
you
say
a
knowledge
of
the
fearful
and
of
the
hopeful
nicias
yes
socrates
and
the
fearful
and
the
hopeful
are
admitted
to
be
future
goods
and
future
evils
nicias
true
socrates
and
the
same
science
has
to
do
with
the
same
things
in
the
future
or
at
any
time
nicias
that
is
true
socrates
then
courage
is
not
the
science
which
is
concerned
with
the
fearful
and
hopeful
for
they
are
future
only
courage
like
the
other
sciences
is
concerned
not
only
with
good
and
evil
of
the
future
but
of
the
present
and
past
and
of
any
time
nicias
that
as
i
suppose
is
true
socrates
then
the
answer
which
you
have
given
nicias
includes
only
a
third
part
of
courage
but
our
question
extended
to
the
whole
nature
of
courage
and
according
to
your
view
that
is
according
to
your
present
view
courage
is
not
only
the
knowledge
of
the
hopeful
and
the
fearful
but
seems
to
include
nearly
every
good
and
evil
without
reference
to
time
what
do
you
say
to
that
alteration
in
your
statement
nicias
i
agree
socrates
socrates
but
then
my
dear
friend
if
a
man
knew
all
good
and
evil
and
how
they
are
and
have
been
and
will
be
produced
would
he
not
be
perfect
and
wanting
in
no
virtue
whether
justice
or
temperance
or
holiness
he
would
possess
them
all
and
he
would
know
which
were
dangers
and
which
were
not
and
guard
against
them
whether
they
were
supernatural
or
natural
and
he
would
provide
the
good
as
he
would
know
how
to
deal
both
with
gods
or
men
nicias
i
think
socrates
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
what
you
say
socrates
but
then
nicias
courage
according
to
this
new
definition
of
yours
instead
of
being
a
part
of
virtue
only
will
be
all
virtue
nicias
it
would
seem
so
socrates
but
we
were
saying
that
courage
is
one
of
the
parts
of
virtue
nicias
yes
that
was
what
we
were
saying
socrates
and
that
is
in
contradiction
with
our
present
view
nicias
that
appears
to
be
the
case
socrates
then
nicias
we
have
not
discovered
what
courage
is
nicias
we
have
not
laches
and
yet
friend
nicias
i
imagined
that
you
would
have
made
the
discovery
when
you
were
so
contemptuous
of
the
answers
which
i
made
to
socrates
i
had
very
great
hopes
that
you
would
have
been
enlightened
by
the
wisdom
of
damon
nicias
i
perceive
laches
that
you
think
nothing
of
having
displayed
your
ignorance
of
the
nature
of
courage
but
you
look
only
to
see
whether
i
have
not
made
a
similar
display
and
if
we
are
both
equally
ignorant
of
the
things
which
a
man
who
is
good
for
anything
should
know
that
i
suppose
will
be
of
no
consequence
you
certainly
appear
to
me
very
like
the
rest
of
the
world
looking
at
your
neighbour
and
not
at
yourself
i
am
of
opinion
that
enough
has
been
said
on
the
subject
which
we
have
been
discussing
and
if
anything
has
been
imperfectly
said
that
may
be
hereafter
corrected
by
the
help
of
damon
whom
you
think
to
laugh
down
although
you
have
never
seen
him
and
with
the
help
of
others
and
when
i
am
satisfied
myself
i
will
freely
impart
my
satisfaction
to
you
for
i
think
that
you
are
very
much
in
want
of
knowledge
laches
you
are
a
philosopher
nicias
of
that
i
am
aware
nevertheless
i
would
recommend
lysimachus
and
melesias
not
to
take
you
and
me
as
advisers
about
the
education
of
their
children
but
as
i
said
at
first
they
should
ask
socrates
and
not
let
him
off
if
my
own
sons
were
old
enough
i
would
have
asked
him
myself
nicias
to
that
i
quite
agree
if
socrates
is
willing
to
take
them
under
his
charge
i
should
not
wish
for
any
one
else
to
be
the
tutor
of
niceratus
but
i
observe
that
when
i
mention
the
matter
to
him
he
recommends
to
me
some
other
tutor
and
refuses
himself
perhaps
he
may
be
more
ready
to
listen
to
you
lysimachus
lysimachus
he
ought
nicias
for
certainly
i
would
do
things
for
him
which
i
would
not
do
for
many
others
what
do
you
say
socrates
will
you
comply
and
are
you
ready
to
give
assistance
in
the
improvement
of
the
youths
socrates
indeed
lysimachus
i
should
be
very
wrong
in
refusing
to
aid
in
the
improvement
of
anybody
and
if
i
had
shown
in
this
conversation
that
i
had
a
knowledge
which
nicias
and
laches
have
not
then
i
admit
that
you
would
be
right
in
inviting
me
to
perform
this
duty
but
as
we
are
all
in
the
same
perplexity
why
should
one
of
us
be
preferred
to
another
i
certainly
think
that
no
one
should
and
under
these
circumstances
let
me
offer
you
a
piece
of
advice
and
this
need
not
go
further
than
ourselves
i
maintain
my
friends
that
every
one
of
us
should
seek
out
the
best
teacher
whom
he
can
find
first
for
ourselves
who
are
greatly
in
need
of
one
and
then
for
the
youth
regardless
of
expense
or
anything
but
i
can
not
advise
that
we
remain
as
we
are
and
if
any
one
laughs
at
us
for
going
to
school
at
our
age
i
would
quote
to
them
the
authority
of
homer
who
says
that
is
not
good
for
a
needy
man
let
us
then
regardless
of
what
may
be
said
of
us
make
the
education
of
the
youths
our
own
education
lysimachus
i
like
your
proposal
socrates
and
as
i
am
the
oldest
i
am
also
the
most
eager
to
go
to
school
with
the
boys
let
me
beg
a
favour
of
you
come
to
my
house
at
dawn
and
we
will
advise
about
these
matters
for
the
present
let
us
make
an
end
of
the
conversation
socrates
i
will
come
to
you
lysimachus
as
you
propose
god
willing
