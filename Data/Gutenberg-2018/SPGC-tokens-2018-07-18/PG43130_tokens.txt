dr
walter
smith
lettice
moved
to
the
window
she
choked
down
a
little
sob
which
was
beginning
to
rise
in
her
throat
and
by
dint
of
resolutely
gazing
out
at
what
was
before
her
tried
to
imagine
not
only
that
she
was
not
crying
but
that
she
had
not
never
had
had
the
slightest
inclination
to
cry
a
clumsy
cart
laden
with
wood
drawn
by
two
bullocks
came
stumbling
down
the
hilly
street
the
stupid
patient
creatures
having
managed
to
wedge
their
burden
against
some
stones
at
the
side
of
the
road
stood
blinking
sleepily
while
their
driver
not
altogether
displeased
at
the
momentary
cessation
of
his
labours
kept
up
a
great
appearance
of
energy
by
the
series
of
strange
guttural
sounds
he
emitted
in
the
intervals
of
strenuous
endeavours
to
light
his
pipe
two
or
three
spanish
labourers
looking
with
their
fine
presence
and
picturesque
costume
like
princes
in
disguise
came
slowly
and
gravely
up
the
hill
the
brilliant
sunshine
lighting
up
the
green
or
scarlet
sashes
knotted
round
their
waists
and
hiding
the
shabbiness
of
their
velveteen
breeches
one
a
youth
of
not
more
than
sixteen
or
seventeen
happened
to
look
up
as
he
passed
by
the
window
where
the
girl
was
standing
and
a
gleam
of
gentle
pity
such
as
one
sees
sometimes
in
the
expression
of
a
great
newfoundland
dog
came
into
his
large
soft
dark
eyes
lettice
started
indignantly
what
does
that
boy
stare
at
me
for
she
said
to
herself
does
he
think
i
am
crying
but
the
quick
movement
had
played
her
false
two
or
three
unmistakable
tears
dropped
on
to
her
dress
more
indignantly
still
the
girl
brushed
them
away
absurd
she
half
murmured
to
herself
i
am
too
silly
to
take
things
to
heart
so
mamma
not
quite
herself
she
is
nervous
and
fanciful
no
doubt
like
all
invalids
and
less
clearheaded
than
usual
one
should
not
always
pay
attention
to
what
an
invalid
says
she
is
weak
and
that
makes
her
give
way
to
feelings
she
would
not
encourage
generally
but
just
then
the
sound
of
her
mother
voice
low
and
faint
certainly
but
in
no
way
nervous
or
querulous
with
even
a
little
undernote
of
cheerfulness
in
the
calm
tones
reached
her
where
she
stood
even
lettice
with
all
her
power
of
could
not
feel
that
it
seemed
like
the
voice
of
a
person
who
did
not
very
well
know
what
she
was
talking
about
and
with
another
little
jerk
of
impatience
she
drew
out
her
watch
i
wish
it
were
time
to
go
out
she
half
muttered
to
herself
nina
is
so
childish
i
ca
understand
how
mamma
does
see
it
for
the
snatches
of
talk
going
on
about
her
mother
sofa
had
to
do
with
nothing
more
important
than
the
grouping
and
placing
of
some
lovely
ferns
and
which
nina
and
lotty
the
baby
of
the
family
had
brought
in
from
their
morning
ramble
yes
said
the
mother
with
real
pleasure
almost
eagerness
in
her
voice
that
is
beautiful
nina
i
shall
have
the
refreshment
of
those
ferns
before
me
all
day
without
having
to
turn
my
head
i
shall
be
able
to
fancy
myself
in
the
woods
again
why
ca
you
come
mamma
said
lotty
childish
voice
it
really
is
far
and
you
could
have
one
of
those
nice
low
little
carriages
all
the
way
i
do
think
it
tire
you
for
an
instant
there
was
no
reply
lettice
felt
though
she
could
not
see
her
mother
that
she
was
striving
to
regain
the
which
lotty
innocent
speeches
now
and
then
almost
upset
and
tears
sadder
but
less
bitter
than
those
which
had
preceded
them
welled
slowly
up
to
the
elder
sister
eyes
then
came
nina
caressing
tones
in
as
she
stooped
over
her
mother
darling
lettice
heard
her
murmur
and
then
turning
to
lotty
run
away
and
take
off
your
things
mamma
is
going
to
sleep
a
little
and
lettice
still
stood
by
the
window
though
the
had
jerked
and
slid
down
the
street
and
was
now
lost
to
view
and
the
young
spaniard
with
the
gentle
lustrous
eyes
had
long
since
passed
out
of
sight
she
was
crying
now
softly
but
unrestrainedly
her
mood
had
changed
it
would
have
mattered
little
to
her
present
feelings
though
all
the
world
had
seen
her
tears
oh
it
is
so
sad
so
unutterably
sad
for
her
and
for
us
she
was
whispering
to
herself
there
are
times
when
i
could
almost
find
it
in
my
heart
to
wish
it
were
already
over
i
can
not
to
think
of
her
suffering
more
just
then
an
arm
was
passed
round
her
waist
and
the
same
caressing
voice
whispered
this
time
in
ear
the
same
word
darling
lettice
did
not
speak
but
she
leant
for
a
moment
against
her
sister
in
a
more
clinging
way
than
was
usual
with
her
nina
she
said
wearily
yes
dear
said
nina
she
was
always
very
proud
poor
girl
when
lettice
seemed
to
turn
to
her
for
support
or
sympathy
it
so
miserable
is
it
yes
dear
said
nina
again
she
would
dearly
have
liked
to
add
some
words
of
comfort
but
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
it
was
true
it
very
miserable
why
should
be
so
unhappy
lettice
went
on
why
should
such
troubles
come
to
us
other
people
go
on
living
happy
peaceful
lives
without
these
dreadful
earthquakes
of
trouble
and
we
have
only
her
i
know
said
nina
softly
and
as
things
are
we
ca
wish
it
to
go
on
can
we
said
lettice
unconsciously
raising
her
voice
a
little
as
she
spoke
more
energetically
she
suffers
more
and
more
and
do
you
know
nina
she
hesitated
nina
looked
round
anxiously
come
into
the
other
room
she
said
bertha
is
in
the
she
hears
the
slightest
movement
but
i
do
think
mamma
is
very
soundly
asleep
and
our
talking
may
disturb
her
we
may
as
well
go
into
the
garden
a
little
said
lettice
indifferently
and
what
was
it
you
were
going
to
say
when
i
interrupted
you
asked
nina
half
timidly
when
they
found
themselves
pacing
up
and
down
a
little
raised
terrace
walk
which
overlooked
the
street
lettice
reflected
for
a
moment
oh
i
remember
she
said
it
was
about
mamma
do
you
think
sometimes
nina
that
all
this
suffering
is
weakening
her
mind
a
little
she
does
seem
so
clear
about
things
and
it
worries
me
for
of
course
though
i
would
like
after
after
mamma
is
gone
to
do
exactly
as
she
would
have
wished
yet
one
must
discriminate
between
what
her
real
wishes
and
advice
are
or
were
and
the
sort
of
weak
yielding
to
feeling
i
i
do
quite
know
what
to
call
it
i
do
mean
to
be
disrespectful
of
course
that
must
have
come
with
her
long
illness
and
the
suffering
and
all
that
and
it
makes
it
difficult
for
me
still
more
difficult
to
discriminate
you
know
for
it
is
such
a
responsibility
on
me
such
a
heavy
responsibility
and
lettice
gave
a
little
sigh
but
something
in
the
sigh
seemed
to
say
that
the
heavy
responsibility
was
not
disagreeable
to
her
nina
walked
on
her
blue
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
her
fair
face
contracted
into
an
expression
of
unusual
perplexity
she
could
not
bear
to
disagree
with
or
contradict
lettice
lettice
so
clever
so
unselfish
so
devoted
the
heroine
of
all
her
girlish
romance
and
yet
i
do
think
quite
as
you
do
about
mamma
she
said
at
last
i
say
that
i
see
any
sign
of
of
her
mind
failing
on
the
contrary
as
she
grows
bodily
weaker
it
seems
to
me
that
her
mind
her
i
would
almost
rather
say
grows
wiser
and
stronger
and
sees
the
real
right
and
best
of
all
things
more
and
more
clearly
she
had
forgotten
her
fear
of
lettice
in
the
last
few
words
but
she
soon
had
cause
to
remember
it
again
mind
failing
repeated
lettice
contemptuously
how
coarsely
you
express
things
nina
whoever
would
say
such
a
thing
as
if
mamma
were
an
old
woman
in
her
dotage
what
the
matter
surely
you
are
not
going
to
for
nothing
for
nina
face
had
grown
very
red
and
she
fumbled
about
with
her
parasol
in
an
uneasy
manner
but
she
was
crying
and
lettice
watching
her
saw
another
cause
for
the
blush
and
the
discomfort
in
the
person
of
a
young
man
who
just
then
crossing
the
street
raised
his
hat
with
a
shy
yet
eager
deference
which
the
most
scrupulous
of
chaperones
could
not
have
objected
to
that
boy
said
lettice
under
her
breath
and
just
now
when
i
wanted
to
make
nina
thoroughly
sympathise
with
me
it
is
really
detestable
one
has
no
privacy
here
we
had
better
go
back
into
the
house
she
said
aloud
hush
lettice
he
will
hear
you
exclaimed
nina
some
stronger
feeling
overcoming
even
her
awe
of
her
sister
he
is
going
to
speak
to
us
and
before
lettice
had
time
to
reply
the
young
man
came
to
a
halt
just
below
where
they
were
standing
is
i
hope
excuse
my
interrupting
you
he
began
for
expression
was
not
encouraging
to
say
the
least
i
was
so
anxious
to
know
if
mrs
morison
is
better
thank
you
said
lettice
civilly
but
coldly
yes
on
the
whole
i
think
she
rather
better
nina
from
under
her
parasol
darted
on
her
sister
a
look
half
of
reproach
half
of
surprise
better
mamma
any
better
how
could
lettice
say
so
to
her
eyes
it
was
very
evident
that
she
was
daily
growing
worse
and
she
felt
sure
that
lettice
saw
it
too
she
allow
it
to
herself
she
thought
but
i
think
it
is
better
to
own
the
truth
i
would
like
philip
dexter
to
know
i
like
him
to
be
sorry
for
us
and
there
was
a
depth
of
sadness
in
her
eyes
that
found
its
way
straight
to
the
young
man
heart
as
without
having
spoken
a
word
she
bent
her
head
in
farewell
when
mr
dexter
turned
to
go
stupid
boy
said
lettice
impatiently
could
he
not
have
seen
we
did
not
want
to
speak
to
any
one
but
he
is
she
went
on
relenting
as
she
often
did
after
a
too
hasty
speech
i
dare
say
he
means
well
and
are
you
not
a
little
just
a
little
prejudiced
said
nina
perhaps
i
am
lettice
replied
calmly
and
so
it
seems
to
me
i
and
you
and
all
of
us
be
it
is
just
that
that
i
am
thinking
of
nina
you
know
how
strongly
papa
felt
about
his
relations
and
till
now
mamma
has
always
seemed
to
feel
the
same
no
interrupted
nina
mamma
has
often
said
to
me
that
though
she
loved
papa
for
feeling
it
so
for
it
was
for
sake
she
herself
could
not
resent
it
all
so
much
but
that
is
not
to
say
should
not
exclaimed
lettice
hotly
mamma
is
an
angel
and
now
especially
here
in
spite
of
herself
the
girl
voice
broke
she
has
none
but
gentle
feelings
to
all
but
for
that
is
what
is
troubling
me
so
mamma
has
actually
said
to
me
that
after
she
is
gone
she
hopes
we
may
make
friends
with
that
if
they
show
any
kindly
disposition
she
hopes
we
will
meet
them
how
we
do
so
nina
it
would
not
be
right
you
do
think
it
would
be
right
nina
hesitated
besides
pursued
lettice
we
shall
have
no
need
of
kindness
or
help
from
them
or
any
one
we
shall
have
enough
to
live
on
with
care
and
management
and
i
understand
all
about
that
i
have
been
training
myself
all
this
time
to
replace
mamma
and
it
is
her
greatest
comfort
to
know
this
i
am
not
afraid
of
anything
except
interference
but
about
money
you
have
some
one
to
help
you
said
nina
about
investments
and
interest
and
dividends
a
girl
manage
all
that
oh
as
for
said
lettice
airily
as
if
such
trifling
matters
were
quite
beneath
her
consideration
of
course
the
lawyers
and
trustees
can
see
to
all
that
our
cousin
godfrey
auriol
is
responsible
for
all
that
and
he
must
be
very
nice
i
do
mind
him
at
all
for
of
course
he
would
never
think
of
interfering
he
is
much
too
young
too
young
said
nina
why
he
is
not
far
off
thirty
philip
dexter
told
me
so
the
other
day
he
is
quite
five
years
older
than
philip
dexter
has
no
business
to
talk
of
any
of
our
relations
at
all
said
lettice
loftily
not
even
about
how
old
they
are
said
nina
no
not
even
that
replied
lettice
though
in
spite
of
herself
a
little
smile
crept
round
her
mouth
then
the
two
girls
stood
still
for
a
moment
and
from
the
highest
point
of
the
terrace
gazed
out
in
silence
on
the
lovely
view
before
them
the
fertile
valley
at
their
feet
the
gently
rising
ground
beyond
and
far
in
the
distance
the
lofty
mountains
with
their
everlasting
crown
of
snow
and
over
all
the
intensity
of
blue
sky
the
blue
sky
of
the
south
glowing
and
gleaming
like
a
turquoise
furnace
how
beautiful
it
is
said
nina
yes
replied
lettice
i
suppose
it
is
but
i
shall
never
care
for
that
kind
of
sunshine
and
blue
sky
again
nina
i
would
rather
have
it
grey
and
cloudy
it
is
such
a
mockery
it
seems
as
if
nature
were
so
heartless
to
smile
and
shine
like
that
when
we
are
oh
so
miserable
i
like
clouds
too
clouds
better
than
that
all
blue
agreed
nina
there
is
no
mystery
no
in
that
sky
it
does
make
me
feel
nearer
heaven
and
then
they
turned
and
went
in
again
for
it
was
but
seldom
they
both
together
left
their
mother
for
even
so
short
a
time
mrs
morison
was
dying
and
she
knew
it
she
had
been
ill
for
more
than
a
year
but
only
since
coming
to
spend
a
winter
in
the
south
had
her
malady
assumed
a
hopeless
form
it
was
not
consumption
for
which
she
was
more
than
thankful
for
her
children
sake
indeed
it
had
been
the
result
of
herself
in
attendance
on
her
husband
whose
death
was
the
consequence
of
an
accident
on
horseback
some
years
previously
there
had
been
a
hope
that
the
change
of
climate
and
the
peculiarly
soothing
effect
on
the
nervous
system
of
the
air
of
esparto
might
have
at
least
arrested
the
progress
of
her
disease
but
this
hope
had
been
of
short
continuance
for
herself
she
was
resigned
and
more
than
resigned
to
die
but
for
long
the
thought
of
leaving
her
children
had
caused
a
terrible
struggle
but
with
decrease
of
physical
strength
had
come
increase
of
moral
force
and
above
all
spiritual
faith
she
could
trust
god
for
herself
why
not
as
fully
for
those
far
dearer
to
her
than
herself
and
slowly
but
surely
she
had
learnt
to
do
so
thankful
for
such
mitigation
of
the
sorrow
as
had
come
by
its
gradual
approach
which
gave
her
time
to
prepare
her
elder
daughters
for
what
would
be
before
them
when
they
should
have
to
face
life
without
her
to
endeavour
too
to
undo
certain
prejudices
which
they
had
not
unnaturally
imbibed
from
their
father
and
even
at
one
time
from
herself
prejudices
which
she
now
saw
to
have
been
exaggerated
which
she
had
always
in
her
heart
felt
to
be
unchristian
but
alas
prejudice
and
dislike
are
seeds
more
easily
sown
than
uprooted
for
they
grow
apace
and
with
a
sigh
mrs
morison
realised
that
as
regarded
lettice
above
all
she
must
leave
this
trouble
with
many
others
in
wiser
hands
i
have
said
and
done
all
i
can
for
the
present
she
said
to
herself
i
must
leave
it
now
i
would
not
have
our
last
days
together
disturbed
by
what
after
all
is
not
a
vital
matter
lettice
is
too
good
and
true
to
stand
out
should
circumstances
show
her
she
is
wrong
for
lettice
good
and
true
unselfish
and
devoted
eager
to
do
right
but
with
the
eagerness
and
of
an
untried
warrior
knowing
nought
of
the
battle
and
thinking
she
knew
all
satisfied
as
to
the
temper
and
perfection
of
the
untested
weapons
in
her
possession
full
of
prejudice
and
while
she
prided
herself
on
her
fairness
and
width
of
judgment
but
self
and
its
opinions
were
kept
much
in
the
background
during
the
few
days
that
followed
the
morning
i
have
been
telling
you
of
very
calm
and
peaceful
days
they
were
very
sweet
and
blessed
to
look
back
upon
in
afterlife
for
their
calm
was
undisturbed
by
any
misgiving
that
they
might
be
the
nay
to
the
sisters
it
was
even
brightened
by
a
faint
return
of
hope
when
they
had
thought
all
hope
was
past
if
mamma
keeps
as
well
as
she
has
been
the
last
few
days
it
will
be
almost
impossible
not
to
begin
hoping
again
said
lettice
one
evening
after
their
mother
had
been
comfortably
settled
for
the
night
nina
less
impulsive
nature
was
slower
to
receive
impressions
yet
there
was
a
gleam
of
real
brightness
in
the
smile
with
which
she
replied
to
her
sister
yes
really
she
said
and
doctors
are
mistaken
we
must
do
all
we
can
to
keep
her
from
having
the
backcast
now
just
so
near
arthur
coming
how
happy
oh
how
wonderfully
happy
we
should
be
if
she
were
to
get
even
a
little
better
better
oh
lettice
just
think
of
it
and
how
she
will
enjoy
having
us
all
together
again
next
week
for
auriol
holidays
begin
then
too
you
know
nina
and
with
arthur
here
to
keep
him
quiet
poor
little
boy
it
will
be
much
easier
than
it
was
at
christmas
and
with
these
happy
thoughts
the
poor
girls
went
to
bed
they
had
slept
the
sound
peaceful
sleep
of
youth
for
three
or
four
hours
perhaps
when
with
a
start
they
were
both
aroused
by
a
soft
knocking
at
the
door
half
thinking
it
was
fancy
they
waited
an
instant
each
unwilling
to
disturb
the
other
but
again
it
came
and
this
time
more
distinctly
trembling
already
so
that
she
could
scarcely
stand
lettice
opened
the
door
ah
there
was
no
need
for
words
there
stood
old
bertha
her
mother
maid
with
white
though
composed
face
and
eyes
resolutely
refusing
to
weep
my
dears
she
whispered
there
is
there
is
a
change
you
must
come
miss
lotty
poor
thing
too
and
i
have
sent
for
master
auriol
lettice
face
worked
convulsively
she
caught
hold
of
nina
and
for
an
instant
they
clung
together
has
whispered
nina
let
us
be
good
for
her
sake
lettice
darling
yes
said
bertha
she
wants
you
all
all
repeated
nina
but
oh
bertha
think
of
poor
arthur
chapter
two
a
who
was
this
and
whence
about
ten
days
later
a
sad
little
group
was
assembled
in
the
pretty
of
the
villa
martine
it
was
a
lovely
evening
but
the
sunshine
outside
was
not
reflected
on
the
young
faces
of
lettice
morison
and
her
brother
and
sister
lotty
and
auriol
the
children
of
the
family
were
amusing
themselves
quietly
enough
on
the
balcony
though
now
and
then
a
little
laugh
made
itself
heard
from
their
direction
causing
lettice
to
look
up
with
a
slight
frown
of
disapproval
on
her
pale
face
how
they
she
said
in
a
low
voice
and
she
was
moving
to
check
them
when
nina
held
her
back
do
be
vexed
with
them
she
said
deprecatingly
they
are
only
children
would
not
be
vexed
indeed
i
think
she
would
be
glad
for
them
not
to
be
too
crushed
down
lettice
eyes
filled
with
tears
they
were
never
far
to
seek
in
these
days
and
she
sank
down
again
in
her
seat
with
a
sigh
the
boy
beside
her
a
slight
fellow
with
soft
eyes
like
nina
put
his
arm
caressingly
round
her
waist
dear
lettice
he
said
i
ca
bear
to
see
you
looking
so
unhappy
lettice
submitted
to
the
caress
but
scarcely
responded
to
it
i
help
it
arthur
she
replied
i
do
not
give
way
to
grief
wrongly
for
i
do
not
allow
it
to
make
me
neglect
any
duty
i
have
been
very
busy
getting
in
all
the
bills
and
so
on
that
we
owe
here
writing
to
the
landlord
and
all
kinds
of
things
you
do
know
all
there
is
upon
me
a
slight
glance
which
lettice
did
not
see
passed
between
nina
and
arthur
it
seemed
to
encourage
the
boy
to
say
more
i
know
he
said
i
have
seen
how
busy
you
have
been
but
are
you
sure
that
it
was
necessary
you
know
none
of
us
have
any
legal
authority
we
are
all
minors
and
our
trustees
settle
these
things
and
it
would
be
so
much
less
painful
for
you
not
to
force
yourself
to
do
it
all
yourself
godfrey
auriol
will
be
here
he
is
coming
on
purpose
to
get
all
settled
godfrey
auriol
repeated
lettice
with
a
slight
tone
of
contempt
what
can
know
about
such
things
his
trusteeship
is
merely
nominal
of
course
it
was
natural
and
right
to
name
him
our
only
relative
though
not
a
very
near
one
but
i
have
thought
of
him
as
really
to
be
considered
you
will
find
yourself
mistaken
then
i
suspect
said
arthur
a
touch
of
boyish
love
of
teasing
breaking
through
even
his
present
subdued
mood
lettice
drew
herself
away
from
his
arm
how
you
she
exclaimed
her
tears
flowing
still
more
freely
nina
speak
to
him
how
he
and
and
arthur
you
ca
know
what
we
have
gone
through
or
you
would
speak
so
you
were
here
you
oh
lettice
do
say
that
to
him
interrupted
nina
it
is
the
not
having
been
here
that
has
been
the
cruellest
of
all
to
him
and
he
has
not
been
selfish
about
it
still
arthur
you
should
say
to
hurt
lettice
for
nina
was
always
assailed
at
her
weakest
point
by
any
approach
to
appeal
on
the
part
of
her
elder
sister
i
am
very
sorry
i
did
mean
it
that
a
stupid
thing
to
say
but
it
true
said
arthur
penitently
and
i
sorry
too
i
did
mean
what
it
sounded
like
said
lettice
i
know
it
has
been
worse
for
you
than
for
any
of
us
she
went
on
looking
up
in
arthur
face
with
her
tearful
eyes
lettice
was
one
of
the
few
people
in
the
world
who
seldom
show
to
greater
advantage
than
when
in
tears
her
eyes
were
not
so
fine
as
nina
and
arthur
soft
brown
ones
they
were
grey
good
sensible
eyes
but
in
a
general
way
with
a
want
of
depth
and
tenderness
in
them
and
this
want
the
tears
supplied
her
recent
sorrow
too
had
as
it
were
etherealised
and
softened
her
whole
face
and
its
expression
whose
real
beauty
was
often
marred
by
a
certain
hardness
which
seemed
to
render
square
and
angular
the
outlines
intended
by
nature
to
be
curved
and
graceful
the
thought
struck
nina
as
her
glance
fell
upon
her
how
sweet
and
lovely
lettice
looks
just
at
this
moment
and
the
thought
though
not
in
quite
the
same
form
struck
another
person
who
just
at
that
moment
entered
the
room
he
had
never
seen
her
before
what
a
lovely
girl
can
that
be
lettice
i
have
always
heard
that
nina
was
the
beauty
but
this
girl
is
too
dark
to
be
nina
were
the
reflections
that
rushed
through
his
mind
in
far
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
them
and
in
a
moment
his
ideas
were
confirmed
for
another
girl
whose
face
had
been
completely
hidden
turned
at
the
slight
sound
of
his
approach
and
by
her
exceedingly
fair
hair
and
complexion
he
recognised
the
nina
who
had
been
described
to
him
but
his
eyes
turned
quickly
from
her
to
her
sister
i
beg
your
pardon
a
thousand
times
he
said
his
own
face
colouring
a
little
as
he
spoke
i
rang
but
as
no
one
answered
and
as
the
front
door
was
open
i
ventured
to
come
in
you
know
who
i
am
for
all
the
three
young
people
had
started
to
their
feet
too
surprised
as
yet
to
find
their
voices
i
am
godfrey
godfrey
auriol
your
cousin
i
hope
i
may
call
myself
by
this
time
lettice
and
the
others
had
recovered
their
wits
lettice
came
a
step
or
two
forward
and
held
out
her
hand
our
cousin
she
repeated
yes
certainly
mr
auriol
we
should
be
very
sorry
not
to
count
you
our
cousin
you
who
are
i
may
say
our
only
relation
and
at
these
words
an
expression
crossed
her
face
which
godfrey
saw
but
did
not
understand
but
it
was
gone
before
it
had
time
to
settle
there
or
to
spoil
the
first
pleasing
impression
which
he
had
received
i
was
so
grieved
he
went
on
while
he
shook
hands
with
them
all
so
very
grieved
that
i
could
not
be
in
time
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
for
me
to
come
over
in
time
for
he
stopped
short
but
they
all
knew
what
he
meant
lettice
lips
quivered
i
wish
you
could
have
come
she
said
softly
and
again
the
expression
that
so
embellished
it
stole
over
her
face
indeed
that
was
really
the
only
reason
for
your
coming
so
far
at
all
you
will
not
find
much
to
see
to
i
think
and
she
smiled
a
little
so
that
mr
auriol
felt
puzzled
her
tone
was
too
gentle
for
him
to
suspect
any
assertion
of
independence
to
be
intended
but
we
all
knew
you
could
not
help
it
she
added
you
are
always
very
busy
are
you
not
said
nina
speaking
for
the
first
time
pretty
well
said
godfrey
smiling
i
lost
no
time
on
the
journey
and
i
was
very
glad
to
get
off
a
day
sooner
than
i
had
expected
i
came
straight
here
from
the
station
trusting
to
you
to
tell
me
what
hotel
i
had
better
go
to
you
came
straight
from
the
station
then
you
had
nothing
to
eat
how
thoughtless
of
us
exclaimed
lettice
and
looking
round
she
saw
that
nina
had
already
disappeared
there
is
an
hotel
close
by
said
arthur
i
go
round
with
you
if
you
like
as
soon
as
you
had
some
dinner
thank
you
said
mr
auriol
i
very
sorry
to
give
you
so
much
trouble
but
i
wanted
to
look
you
up
at
once
i
can
only
stay
so
very
short
a
time
i
must
be
back
in
england
within
the
week
how
can
you
talk
of
giving
us
trouble
said
arthur
it
is
you
who
are
giving
yourself
a
great
deal
for
us
and
he
glanced
at
lettice
as
if
to
hint
to
her
that
she
should
endorse
his
speech
but
she
said
nothing
only
later
in
the
evening
when
their
visitor
was
just
about
leaving
she
said
to
him
in
a
quiet
but
somewhat
studied
voice
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
see
something
of
the
neighbourhood
while
you
are
here
there
are
so
many
pretty
excursions
and
in
a
week
one
can
do
a
good
deal
arthur
himself
has
not
seen
much
he
has
only
been
three
weeks
with
us
all
the
months
we
have
been
here
and
he
would
enjoy
going
about
with
you
godfrey
auriol
was
not
deficient
in
perception
still
less
in
quick
resolution
when
he
saw
occasion
for
it
he
hesitated
but
for
half
a
second
only
before
he
replied
yes
he
said
calmly
it
would
be
very
pleasant
were
it
feasible
but
you
know
miss
morison
it
is
not
for
i
have
come
all
this
way
there
is
a
great
deal
of
business
to
be
seen
to
and
for
some
of
it
i
must
have
your
attention
though
i
would
gladly
spare
you
all
trouble
if
i
could
at
what
hour
may
i
come
it
is
no
use
putting
off
what
has
to
be
done
however
painful
lettice
colour
rose
high
all
over
her
face
she
felt
the
mortification
doubly
since
it
was
in
the
presence
of
her
younger
sister
and
brother
but
she
did
her
best
not
to
show
what
she
felt
and
to
any
one
not
knowing
her
well
her
emotion
might
have
passed
for
what
was
only
natural
and
almost
seemly
under
the
circumstances
and
even
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
as
she
answered
it
required
a
nice
and
skilled
observer
to
detect
the
latent
armour
of
resistance
in
which
she
was
determined
to
clothe
herself
unfortunately
for
her
her
three
companions
the
two
younger
ones
thanks
to
their
intimate
knowledge
of
her
peculiarities
the
third
by
dint
of
unusual
and
cultivated
power
of
discrimination
which
she
herself
had
raised
to
suspicion
were
not
deceived
by
her
words
in
themselves
perfectly
unexceptionable
at
any
hour
you
like
she
said
of
course
it
is
best
that
we
should
know
all
about
our
money
though
i
really
do
know
already
all
that
is
practically
necessary
but
these
kind
of
formalities
must
be
gone
through
i
suppose
so
i
can
be
ready
at
any
hour
you
like
will
ten
do
perfectly
if
it
will
suit
you
said
mr
auriol
glancing
inquiringly
at
nina
and
arthur
i
shall
want
you
all
three
the
two
little
ones
of
course
it
would
be
absurd
to
talk
to
on
such
matters
but
you
three
are
much
in
the
same
position
you
are
all
minors
besides
it
is
not
about
money
matters
i
want
to
speak
to
you
these
last
two
or
three
sentences
were
bitter
pills
for
lettice
to
swallow
arthur
and
nina
had
the
consideration
not
to
look
at
her
once
she
opened
her
lips
as
if
about
to
speak
but
thought
better
of
it
and
said
nothing
i
can
put
all
that
right
at
the
proper
time
she
reflected
no
use
beginning
about
it
now
but
it
is
really
too
absurd
nina
and
arthur
counted
on
a
par
with
and
it
did
seem
so
very
absurd
that
she
felt
she
could
afford
to
smile
at
it
and
with
this
consideration
her
calm
returned
so
that
her
brother
and
sister
and
even
mr
auriol
himself
were
surprised
and
somewhat
impressed
by
the
perfectly
unruffled
tone
in
which
she
said
pleasantly
very
well
then
morning
at
ten
we
shall
be
ready
she
must
be
extremely
thought
godfrey
when
arthur
having
shown
him
to
his
hotel
had
left
him
alone
for
the
night
i
am
afraid
i
was
rather
rough
to
her
her
little
assumption
of
independence
was
really
only
touching
poor
child
he
went
on
to
reflect
little
dreaming
deluded
man
of
what
was
before
him
and
nina
is
very
pretty
and
very
attractive
i
do
wonder
at
dexter
though
she
is
not
to
be
compared
with
lettice
for
real
beauty
of
feature
and
expression
few
words
passed
between
the
sisters
after
their
guest
had
left
them
when
arthur
came
in
he
found
lettice
sitting
alone
nina
had
gone
to
bed
and
she
too
was
tired
and
meant
to
follow
her
at
once
and
do
you
like
him
arthur
could
not
help
saying
as
he
kissed
his
sister
for
good
night
like
him
whom
said
lettice
as
if
awaking
from
a
brown
study
mr
auriol
oh
yes
i
like
him
very
well
he
is
much
what
i
expected
and
arthur
said
no
more
notwithstanding
his
long
journey
of
the
preceding
days
mr
auriol
was
awake
and
up
betimes
the
following
morning
it
was
several
years
since
he
had
been
out
of
his
own
country
and
the
sights
and
sounds
about
him
struck
him
almost
as
freshly
as
if
he
saw
and
heard
them
for
the
first
time
the
early
morning
sunshine
was
softer
and
less
monotonous
than
the
midday
effulgence
which
lettice
had
complained
of
and
seemed
to
add
vividness
without
glare
to
every
detail
of
the
picturesque
scene
on
which
his
windows
looked
out
for
it
was
at
esparto
and
the
town
was
a
for
the
denizens
of
many
widely
varying
districts
there
were
the
country
people
from
the
near
neighbourhood
the
women
save
for
their
brilliant
eyes
and
prematurely
aged
through
hard
work
and
exposure
their
brown
skin
showing
harder
and
browner
from
the
contrast
with
the
silk
kerchiefs
skilfully
knotted
round
their
heads
yet
as
a
rule
seemingly
contented
and
cheerful
enough
as
they
chattered
and
chaffered
round
the
great
ancient
fountain
the
centre
of
the
place
the
men
far
less
numerous
and
far
less
energetic
handsome
fellows
many
of
them
though
less
so
than
the
gaudily
attired
spanish
mountaineers
lured
to
esparto
by
the
work
sometimes
to
be
had
there
in
plenty
while
yet
looking
as
if
labour
or
exertion
of
any
kind
was
completely
beneath
their
lordly
selves
and
here
and
there
recognisable
at
once
by
those
acquainted
with
their
peculiar
type
basques
descendants
of
that
mysterious
race
whose
origin
and
language
have
so
long
puzzled
the
learned
in
such
subjects
nor
were
there
wanting
specimens
of
still
more
remote
nationalities
two
or
three
negro
servants
were
bargaining
and
purchasing
for
their
masters
and
some
little
english
children
who
had
coaxed
their
maids
to
get
up
extra
early
before
it
was
hot
to
see
the
fun
and
bustle
in
the
while
a
russian
nurse
gorgeous
in
scarlet
and
gold
embroidery
indolently
surveyed
the
scene
from
a
balcony
opposite
it
was
picturesque
in
the
extreme
and
amusing
but
after
a
while
staring
out
of
the
window
being
a
diversion
he
most
rarely
indulged
in
mr
auriol
tired
of
it
and
after
his
modest
breakfast
of
coffee
and
a
roll
finding
it
was
barely
nine
he
strolled
out
for
a
walk
though
his
ideas
were
of
the
vaguest
as
to
what
direction
he
should
take
i
have
nearly
an
hour
before
they
will
expect
me
at
the
villa
martine
he
said
to
himself
i
have
no
wish
to
rub
mistress
lettice
the
wrong
way
by
turning
up
too
soon
it
strikes
me
she
would
look
upon
that
as
almost
worse
than
being
too
late
where
shall
i
go
he
was
turning
the
corner
of
the
street
or
place
rather
as
he
asked
himself
this
question
and
before
he
had
time
to
answer
it
he
almost
knocked
against
a
young
man
who
was
hurrying
in
his
direction
pardon
was
on
the
lips
of
both
when
both
exchanged
it
for
a
more
friendly
greeting
dexter
auriol
they
respectively
exclaimed
and
then
the
added
i
was
just
going
to
the
hotel
to
ask
if
you
had
come
or
were
coming
arthur
morison
told
me
some
days
ago
that
you
were
expected
i
met
him
accidentally
they
did
not
expect
me
till
and
i
came
yesterday
so
there
has
not
been
time
for
them
to
tell
you
you
see
them
sometimes
do
you
not
you
mean
do
i
visit
them
scarcely
i
used
to
go
there
sometimes
before
mrs
morison
got
so
very
was
always
kindness
and
cordiality
itself
to
me
you
know
i
had
got
to
know
the
second
miss
morison
very
well
a
year
ago
in
england
when
she
was
staying
with
some
neighbours
of
ours
yes
i
remember
said
mr
auriol
but
he
spoke
absently
and
it
is
all
that
horrid
family
feud
when
they
at
least
i
know
why
i
should
say
i
believe
it
is
only
lettice
found
out
my
connections
the
difference
was
most
marked
though
before
then
they
had
been
quite
friendly
and
i
had
hoped
to
introduce
them
and
my
sister
to
each
other
those
sorts
of
things
are
really
too
bad
carrying
them
down
to
the
younger
generation
godfrey
bent
his
head
in
acquiescence
but
did
not
speak
do
you
philip
went
on
again
after
a
moment
pause
and
with
some
little
embarrassment
do
you
think
her
as
pretty
as
you
had
been
told
more
so
pretty
is
not
at
all
the
word
for
her
i
think
her
distinctly
beautiful
mr
auriol
replied
with
a
sort
of
burst
of
enthusiasm
which
somehow
seemed
rather
to
disconcert
philip
i
thought
you
would
that
fair
hair
with
such
dark
eyes
is
so
very
uncommon
he
replied
quietly
and
instantly
it
flashed
upon
mr
auriol
that
they
were
speaking
at
cross
purposes
he
smiled
to
himself
but
for
reasons
of
his
own
and
being
perfectly
unaware
of
the
impression
his
words
had
made
upon
his
companion
he
decided
not
to
explain
his
mistake
your
sister
mrs
leyland
is
much
better
i
was
glad
to
hear
he
said
courteously
thinking
it
just
as
well
to
change
the
subject
oh
much
better
thank
you
quite
well
indeed
we
shall
be
leaving
immediately
in
fact
we
should
have
left
already
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
when
it
became
evident
that
mrs
morison
was
sinking
i
persuaded
anna
to
stay
on
a
little
just
to
see
if
perhaps
we
could
be
of
some
service
to
those
poor
children
they
seemed
so
lonely
it
was
very
good
of
you
said
godfrey
warmly
i
i
thought
my
uncle
and
aunt
would
have
wished
it
and
anna
thought
so
too
said
philip
but
it
was
no
use
i
believe
lettice
would
rather
have
applied
to
any
utter
stranger
than
to
us
really
said
godfrey
surprised
and
even
a
little
shocked
i
had
no
idea
they
still
felt
so
strongly
perhaps
it
just
as
well
you
told
me
for
i
see
i
shall
have
some
rather
ticklish
business
to
manage
but
forewarned
is
forearmed
i
may
call
on
mrs
leyland
some
evening
i
hope
i
shall
have
very
few
here
oh
certainly
said
philip
she
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
then
the
conversation
drifted
into
general
matters
philip
escorted
mr
auriol
to
one
or
two
points
of
interest
in
the
little
town
and
at
ten
precisely
the
latter
found
himself
at
the
gate
of
the
villa
martine
chapter
three
the
tug
of
war
your
courage
much
more
than
your
prudence
you
showed
burns
lettice
received
her
cousin
in
the
she
was
of
course
expecting
him
but
there
was
not
a
touch
of
nervousness
in
her
manner
as
she
quietly
shook
hands
with
him
and
in
a
friendly
perhaps
slightly
patronising
tone
as
if
to
put
him
quite
at
his
ease
hoped
that
he
found
the
hotel
comfortable
that
he
had
slept
well
was
not
too
tired
with
his
journey
and
so
on
to
all
of
which
mr
auriol
replied
with
equal
composure
but
he
was
eyeing
the
young
lady
all
the
time
taking
measure
of
her
much
more
closely
than
she
had
any
idea
of
he
observed
her
too
with
a
certain
curiosity
as
to
her
appearance
the
night
before
he
had
seen
her
in
a
subdued
light
almost
indeed
in
shadow
as
the
consciousness
of
her
recent
tears
had
made
her
avoid
coming
forward
conspicuously
and
he
wondered
if
he
should
find
her
as
lovely
as
she
had
then
appeared
she
is
and
she
is
not
he
decided
her
features
are
all
that
i
pictured
them
but
the
soft
sweet
expression
is
gone
yes
this
morning
i
can
believe
her
to
be
both
prejudiced
and
and
his
glance
rested
with
pleasure
on
the
somewhat
anxious
but
thoroughly
womanly
and
gentle
expression
of
nina
fair
face
as
she
just
then
entered
the
room
followed
by
arthur
mr
auriol
looked
round
him
inquiringly
have
you
any
other
room
at
liberty
he
said
where
there
is
perhaps
a
large
table
there
are
a
number
of
papers
i
wish
to
show
you
and
he
touched
a
packet
which
he
held
under
his
arm
we
can
go
into
the
said
lettice
opening
a
door
which
led
into
it
as
she
spoke
though
really
mr
auriol
you
need
not
give
yourself
so
much
trouble
we
are
perfectly
satisfied
that
our
money
is
in
good
hands
mamma
often
told
me
that
my
father
had
given
himself
immense
trouble
to
place
it
safely
so
that
at
his
death
there
should
be
no
trouble
in
short
that
our
trustees
would
have
nothing
to
do
but
leave
it
as
it
was
mr
auriol
made
no
reply
but
when
the
four
were
seated
round
the
he
deliberately
undid
his
packet
and
drew
from
it
paper
after
paper
all
neatly
labelled
and
arranged
which
he
placed
beside
him
these
he
said
touching
two
documents
are
the
statements
of
your
capital
and
of
your
income
i
have
had
copies
made
so
that
i
can
leave
these
with
you
in
case
you
ever
wish
to
refer
to
them
as
you
are
all
three
of
an
age
to
understand
such
matters
to
a
certain
extent
you
said
just
now
miss
morison
that
everything
to
do
with
your
money
matters
had
been
thoroughly
seen
to
before
your
death
i
explain
to
you
that
all
was
not
as
satisfactory
as
you
imagine
your
father
as
he
constantly
said
himself
was
not
a
good
man
of
business
i
am
not
afraid
of
your
misunderstanding
me
when
i
say
this
you
can
not
but
know
how
deeply
attached
to
him
i
was
and
how
much
gratitude
i
shall
always
feel
to
him
for
much
past
kindness
i
simply
state
the
fact
with
no
disparagement
to
him
when
he
died
his
affairs
were
exceedingly
confused
and
involved
and
i
as
one
of
his
executors
the
only
one
for
you
remember
colonel
brown
died
suddenly
just
when
your
father
did
hardly
knew
what
to
do
and
i
tell
you
honestly
that
i
never
could
have
got
things
into
the
satisfactory
state
they
are
now
in
but
for
help
which
i
can
not
exaggerate
and
from
a
quarter
where
all
things
considered
one
could
little
have
expected
it
mr
auriol
paused
and
looked
round
him
all
the
three
young
faces
expressed
strong
feeling
on
lettice
there
was
a
look
of
tension
painful
to
see
her
lips
moved
as
if
she
would
have
asked
her
cousin
to
go
on
but
no
sound
came
he
understood
her
however
and
pitying
her
heartily
he
continued
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
paper
before
him
that
help
came
from
your
father
stepbrother
the
only
son
of
his
father
by
his
second
marriage
the
merchant
mr
ingram
morison
there
was
a
dead
silence
the
tears
were
in
nina
eyes
and
face
was
quivering
but
lettice
was
deadly
pale
and
stony
and
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
so
unlike
itself
that
all
started
did
my
mother
know
this
she
said
in
a
tone
which
matched
the
look
on
her
face
not
at
first
said
mr
auriol
still
avoiding
to
turn
his
eyes
in
her
direction
not
till
things
were
all
in
order
would
mr
morison
allow
her
to
be
told
anything
he
risked
very
large
sums
of
course
not
so
large
to
him
as
to
a
less
wealthy
man
but
still
actually
large
to
save
your
fortune
and
thanks
to
his
great
acuteness
and
experience
he
succeeded
most
wonderfully
so
that
at
the
present
time
you
do
not
actually
owe
him
thank
heaven
for
that
murmured
lettice
mr
auriol
turned
upon
her
with
a
sharp
movement
of
indignation
but
when
he
went
on
speaking
it
was
as
if
continuing
his
words
and
not
as
if
addressing
himself
to
her
in
particular
but
you
do
owe
him
what
to
a
generous
mind
is
never
a
painful
burden
an
debt
of
gratitude
then
i
recall
my
words
burst
out
lettice
i
wish
to
heaven
it
money
that
i
could
work
for
it
work
my
fingers
to
the
bone
till
i
could
repay
every
farthing
to
owe
gratitude
that
can
be
counted
in
money
to
man
oh
it
is
too
much
how
dared
you
do
it
she
flashed
out
to
godfrey
how
dared
you
let
interfere
you
would
rather
have
had
your
mother
reduced
to
beggary
you
would
rather
have
had
her
last
days
tortured
by
anxiety
for
all
of
you
did
not
resent
it
she
who
had
far
more
right
than
any
of
you
to
be
influenced
by
the
old
quarrel
with
which
ingram
morison
remember
had
no
more
to
do
than
i
had
was
not
ashamed
to
be
grateful
and
to
show
her
trust
and
confidence
in
him
as
you
will
see
when
at
last
she
knew
a
great
part
though
not
the
whole
of
the
truth
and
why
did
she
not
tell
me
then
oh
mamma
mamma
wailed
lettice
forgetful
of
or
indifferent
to
her
cousin
presence
why
did
you
not
tell
me
i
thought
i
had
your
whole
confidence
and
to
find
this
out
she
shook
with
sobs
and
godfrey
face
softened
lettice
he
said
calling
her
for
the
first
time
by
her
name
though
none
of
them
himself
included
noticed
that
he
did
so
my
poor
child
try
to
be
reasonable
your
mother
did
not
intentionally
deceive
you
it
was
only
very
lately
she
knew
about
it
ingram
morison
acted
with
the
greatest
delicacy
exaggerated
delicacy
he
wanted
no
one
to
know
what
he
had
done
and
even
at
the
last
i
could
only
persuade
him
to
let
me
tell
her
part
of
it
she
meant
to
tell
it
to
you
gradually
knowing
your
strong
feelings
about
it
she
wrote
so
to
me
i
have
the
letter
but
evidently
she
had
not
time
to
do
so
or
she
may
have
found
it
more
difficult
than
she
expected
and
as
he
again
paused
there
rose
before
lettice
the
remembrance
of
the
morning
when
her
gentle
almost
timid
mother
had
tried
to
lead
to
the
subject
of
the
morison
relations
of
her
softened
feelings
towards
them
and
how
she
lettice
had
repulsed
the
attempt
with
decision
almost
approaching
violence
and
had
afterwards
said
to
nina
that
she
thought
bodily
weakness
must
be
affecting
her
mother
judgment
and
then
at
the
last
it
had
been
or
had
as
it
so
often
does
so
sudden
there
had
been
no
time
or
strength
for
more
than
a
whispered
blessing
before
the
smile
of
perfect
peace
with
which
she
closed
her
eyes
on
this
world
had
lighted
up
the
loved
worn
features
and
she
had
breathed
her
gentle
soul
away
lettice
sobbed
still
but
more
softly
now
and
mr
auriol
went
on
had
she
lived
she
would
i
know
have
wished
to
know
the
whole
and
wished
you
all
to
know
it
too
and
i
too
confess
to
some
personal
feeling
in
the
matter
i
too
have
some
family
pride
your
mother
was
my
cousin
of
the
same
blood
could
not
bear
that
so
great
a
service
should
be
unrecognised
and
before
coming
here
i
told
mr
morison
that
unless
he
would
consent
to
my
stating
the
facts
to
you
and
having
no
mystery
or
concealment
about
it
i
would
try
to
throw
up
the
whole
and
then
said
arthur
then
said
mr
auriol
slowly
if
you
all
though
no
i
will
not
insult
you
by
supposing
such
a
thing
but
you
all
retained
this
terrible
prejudice
against
an
innocent
man
things
would
be
still
worse
for
he
would
be
your
only
guardian
another
blow
for
lettice
our
guardian
exclaimed
nina
in
surprise
yes
by
your
father
will
your
mother
and
i
were
your
guardians
and
while
she
lived
part
of
it
was
merely
nominal
for
me
but
she
had
the
power
to
appoint
another
in
case
of
her
death
and
she
did
so
she
appointed
exclaimed
nina
yes
your
uncle
or
if
you
prefer
to
be
quite
exact
mr
ingram
morison
godfrey
replied
simply
then
without
waiting
for
further
remarks
he
went
on
to
explain
as
clearly
as
was
possible
to
such
inexperienced
ears
a
number
of
business
details
summing
up
by
giving
them
a
clear
idea
of
what
money
they
were
sure
of
of
some
which
still
remained
uncertain
and
by
making
them
most
distinctly
recognise
that
but
for
their
uncle
interference
the
post
of
trustee
of
their
possessions
would
indeed
long
before
this
have
been
a
sinecure
and
now
he
said
there
remains
only
one
more
duty
before
we
talk
about
less
painful
and
overwhelming
subjects
i
have
here
your
last
letter
to
me
sending
me
her
will
which
she
wished
me
to
look
over
as
i
did
and
going
on
to
express
her
last
wishes
shall
i
read
it
to
you
or
shall
i
leave
it
for
you
to
read
alone
read
it
now
said
lettice
rather
to
her
brother
and
surprise
for
they
did
not
hear
the
words
which
she
whispered
to
herself
better
drink
the
cup
of
bitterness
to
the
dregs
and
have
it
over
so
mr
auriol
read
the
letter
aloud
it
was
a
simply
expressed
but
thoughtfully
considered
letter
with
no
word
or
allusion
to
distress
or
wound
any
of
her
children
she
spoke
of
her
intention
to
explain
to
them
these
facts
which
had
so
recently
come
to
her
knowledge
but
that
before
doing
so
she
would
wish
to
know
more
the
whole
in
fact
that
her
words
might
have
the
more
weight
in
overcoming
the
prejudice
which
to
a
certain
extent
she
blamed
herself
for
having
if
not
encouraged
at
least
not
opposed
my
husband
she
said
resented
his
family
behaviour
for
sake
i
have
a
right
to
do
anything
i
choose
towards
breaking
down
the
barrier
of
which
i
fear
i
was
in
great
measure
the
unwilling
cause
and
he
had
he
lived
to
know
his
brother
as
i
now
know
him
would
have
felt
with
me
in
this
for
though
he
was
hasty
and
impulsive
he
was
when
he
would
allow
himself
to
see
things
clearly
essentially
just
and
how
can
any
one
blame
ingram
morison
for
events
which
took
place
when
he
was
a
mere
child
then
she
went
on
to
beg
godfrey
to
convey
to
her
her
deep
sense
of
gratitude
for
what
she
already
knew
and
her
hope
that
he
would
accept
the
guardianship
which
no
one
else
would
be
so
fitted
for
she
spoke
of
her
children
altogether
of
the
old
prejudice
as
shared
by
them
all
in
no
way
singling
out
lettice
as
the
least
reasonable
or
persuadable
so
that
as
she
listened
lettice
could
not
but
feel
in
her
heart
that
it
was
thanks
to
herself
alone
if
she
come
to
appear
so
in
mr
auriol
eyes
though
it
is
to
be
feared
that
but
small
was
the
result
of
this
consciousness
and
then
with
some
general
expression
of
confidence
in
godfrey
and
in
his
good
judgment
and
good
feeling
mingled
with
hopes
that
she
might
live
long
enough
to
understand
all
quite
clearly
and
to
make
some
arrangements
for
her
children
future
the
letter
closed
i
was
going
to
answer
this
letter
said
mr
auriol
i
could
not
do
so
till
i
had
mr
morison
permission
to
tell
the
whole
which
caused
some
delay
but
i
was
just
going
to
answer
it
when
i
got
arthur
telegram
telling
me
of
her
death
you
see
the
date
is
very
recent
and
he
held
out
the
letter
to
nina
who
leant
eagerly
forward
while
lettice
held
herself
stiffly
aloof
i
managed
to
see
mr
morison
before
i
came
away
had
i
not
done
so
my
coming
would
not
have
been
of
much
use
and
got
his
answers
to
all
i
had
to
ask
him
and
this
is
what
he
says
he
accepts
the
trusteeship
of
your
money
unconditionally
for
which
you
can
not
be
too
thankful
the
guardianship
which
he
legally
decline
for
he
is
not
forced
to
accept
what
he
had
not
first
been
asked
about
he
accepts
too
but
only
to
a
certain
extent
he
will
not
interfere
with
you
in
any
way
disagreeable
to
you
unless
positively
obliged
to
do
so
he
leaves
details
to
me
if
am
satisfied
he
will
be
so
at
the
same
time
he
earnestly
to
be
to
you
all
not
only
a
guardian
but
an
uncle
i
am
empowered
to
invite
you
all
as
soon
as
you
can
leave
here
to
go
to
his
country
house
and
remain
there
as
long
as
you
like
in
any
case
till
some
definite
arrangement
can
be
made
for
you
exclaimed
lettice
interrupting
mr
auriol
nina
arthur
you
will
support
me
in
this
godfrey
waited
till
she
was
silent
but
then
without
giving
the
others
time
to
reply
he
went
on
it
is
premature
for
you
to
give
any
answer
as
yet
allow
me
to
go
on
with
what
i
have
to
say
without
interrupting
me
till
i
have
fulfilled
my
commission
mr
morison
also
wished
me
to
say
that
if
arthur
has
any
taste
for
business
he
will
give
him
a
position
in
his
firm
such
as
he
would
to
a
son
of
his
own
if
he
had
one
arthur
colour
rose
and
he
seemed
as
if
about
to
say
something
but
he
checked
himself
not
so
lettice
arthur
is
going
into
the
army
like
papa
he
is
going
up
for
woolwich
next
christmas
that
has
been
decided
long
ago
again
with
ceremonious
politeness
mr
auriol
waited
till
she
left
off
speaking
then
without
taking
the
slightest
notice
of
what
she
had
said
he
proceeded
or
if
arthur
chooses
any
other
career
he
will
do
his
best
to
help
him
i
think
that
is
the
substance
of
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
from
your
uncle
you
will
give
me
an
answer
before
i
leave
some
days
before
indeed
the
day
after
suppose
we
say
it
will
be
the
greatest
possible
satisfaction
to
me
if
you
accept
your
uncle
invitation
if
not
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
in
arranging
something
else
we
are
quite
ready
to
tell
you
what
we
intend
doing
now
at
once
if
you
choose
said
lettice
not
now
i
wish
you
to
think
it
over
and
consult
together
he
replied
and
i
must
tell
you
frankly
that
what
you
doing
is
not
the
question
you
may
tell
me
what
you
with
all
freedom
and
if
i
can
i
will
help
you
to
carry
out
your
wishes
but
if
i
do
approve
of
them
i
am
bound
by
every
consideration
to
tell
you
so
and
to
forbid
them
if
this
sounds
very
ungracious
i
am
sorry
for
it
but
i
can
not
help
it
having
undertaken
a
very
here
he
hesitated
and
evidently
substituted
a
milder
word
for
the
one
that
had
been
on
his
lips
onerous
task
i
will
carry
it
out
to
the
best
of
my
power
but
it
rests
with
you
three
to
make
it
a
painful
or
pleasant
one
he
rose
as
he
spoke
nina
rose
too
and
held
out
her
hand
thank
you
cousin
godfrey
she
said
simply
for
all
your
kindness
mr
auriol
turned
to
lettice
will
you
too
not
shake
hands
with
me
lettice
he
said
with
a
tone
in
his
voice
which
touched
her
a
little
of
course
she
said
rousing
herself
as
it
were
by
an
effort
i
can
have
no
possible
reason
for
shaking
hands
with
you
i
am
only
bitterly
most
bitterly
grieved
that
we
should
be
and
have
been
the
cause
of
such
trouble
to
you
do
not
be
bitterly
grieved
then
he
said
smiling
give
me
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
i
have
been
and
may
be
of
service
to
you
i
am
your
kinsman
it
is
only
natural
be
reasonable
and
try
to
trust
those
who
wish
to
be
true
friends
to
you
but
at
these
last
words
he
felt
the
hand
which
he
had
held
for
a
moment
or
two
struggle
in
his
grasp
and
with
an
almost
inaudible
sigh
he
released
it
will
you
give
me
the
names
so
far
as
you
know
them
of
the
tradespeople
here
and
your
landlord
and
so
on
he
said
gently
i
must
make
up
as
accurate
a
statement
as
i
can
there
is
a
great
deal
more
to
do
at
such
times
than
you
have
any
idea
of
and
then
he
went
on
to
explain
some
details
of
which
till
now
she
had
had
no
idea
whatever
to
the
rather
bewildered
girl
she
replied
meekly
enough
and
when
he
had
got
the
required
information
he
went
out
with
arthur
as
his
guide
chapter
four
an
old
story
and
a
new
secret
good
nature
and
good
sense
must
ever
join
to
err
is
human
to
forgive
divine
pope
it
was
the
last
evening
of
the
young
morisons
being
all
together
at
the
villa
martine
for
arthur
was
returning
to
england
the
following
day
and
a
fortnight
or
so
later
the
sisters
and
little
auriol
under
the
convoy
of
old
bertha
were
to
follow
him
there
lettice
had
gone
early
to
her
room
she
was
worn
out
though
she
would
not
allow
it
with
all
she
had
gone
through
during
the
last
week
or
two
and
since
mr
auriol
had
left
she
had
put
less
constraint
on
herself
she
no
longer
felt
the
necessity
of
calling
pride
to
her
aid
i
am
so
dreadfully
sorry
for
lettice
said
nina
as
she
and
arthur
were
sitting
together
unwilling
though
it
was
already
late
to
lose
any
of
their
few
remaining
hours
so
am
i
said
arthur
but
i
am
sorry
for
ourselves
too
nina
there
is
no
doubt
that
all
our
troubles
are
very
much
aggravated
by
lettice
arthur
exclaimed
nina
what
do
you
mean
how
could
we
ever
get
on
without
her
oh
i
know
all
that
said
the
boy
for
boy
he
still
was
though
nearly
seventeen
weariedly
i
know
she
is
very
good
and
devoted
and
clever
too
but
nina
if
she
were
but
less
obstinate
and
how
much
happier
at
least
how
much
less
unhappy
we
should
be
if
she
had
taken
the
advice
of
godfrey
auriol
and
made
friends
with
our
uncle
knowing
too
that
mother
wished
it
of
course
i
wo
allow
to
godfrey
that
i
disagree
with
her
at
all
costs
as
you
and
i
determined
we
must
keep
together
but
it
is
a
terrible
pity
i
do
however
see
that
for
the
present
it
makes
very
much
difference
and
in
time
lettice
may
change
too
late
perhaps
said
arthur
moodily
it
just
now
that
i
think
it
make
such
a
miserable
difference
and
as
nina
looked
up
with
surprise
and
some
alarm
and
was
just
going
to
ask
him
to
explain
himself
he
added
hastily
as
if
eager
to
change
the
subject
do
you
know
the
whole
story
nina
the
story
of
the
old
quarrel
between
my
father
and
his
family
i
have
heard
it
i
suppose
but
i
have
got
confused
about
it
though
i
did
like
to
let
godfrey
see
that
i
was
so
lettice
has
always
been
so
violent
about
it
so
determined
that
there
was
only
the
one
way
of
looking
at
it
that
it
was
no
use
asking
her
and
just
these
last
days
it
has
dawned
upon
me
that
i
know
very
little
about
it
i
have
accepted
it
as
a
sort
of
legend
that
was
not
to
be
questioned
i
do
know
that
there
is
very
much
to
tell
not
of
actual
facts
said
nina
of
course
it
was
all
complicated
by
personal
feeling
as
such
things
always
are
mamma
told
me
all
and
lately
as
you
know
she
regretted
very
much
having
not
tried
more
to
bring
papa
and
his
brother
together
he
our
uncle
was
perfectly
blameless
he
was
fifteen
years
younger
than
papa
papa
you
know
was
grandpapa
only
son
by
his
first
marriage
his
mother
died
young
and
he
as
he
often
said
himself
was
dreadfully
spoilt
his
father
married
again
when
he
was
about
twelve
and
though
his
stepmother
was
very
good
and
nice
he
was
determined
never
to
like
her
and
set
himself
against
whatever
she
said
and
fancied
she
influenced
grandpapa
very
often
when
very
likely
she
did
not
grandpapa
was
in
business
as
of
course
you
know
and
very
much
respected
and
very
successful
he
was
of
very
respectable
ancestry
his
people
had
been
farmers
but
not
at
all
and
he
was
the
sort
of
man
to
be
proud
of
having
made
his
own
way
and
to
despise
those
who
tried
to
be
above
their
real
position
he
had
always
determined
that
papa
should
follow
him
in
his
business
but
as
might
have
been
expected
from
a
spoilt
boy
papa
nothing
would
please
him
but
going
into
the
army
yes
i
know
that
part
of
it
said
arthur
there
must
have
been
stormy
scenes
and
most
miserable
discussions
any
way
it
ended
in
papa
running
away
and
enlisting
which
by
people
of
grandpapa
class
was
thought
a
terrible
disgrace
then
grandpapa
vowed
he
would
disinherit
him
and
he
made
a
will
putting
his
little
son
ingram
entirely
in
papa
place
and
giving
papa
only
a
very
small
fortune
and
papa
persisted
in
believing
that
this
was
his
stepmother
doing
though
mamma
has
often
told
me
they
had
no
sort
of
proof
not
even
that
it
was
so
and
the
way
she
acted
afterwards
certainly
did
not
seem
as
if
she
were
selfish
or
scheming
but
interrupted
arthur
all
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
and
she
always
said
it
was
about
her
well
listen
said
nina
time
went
on
papa
behaved
splendidly
and
as
soon
as
it
was
he
got
a
commission
and
a
year
or
two
after
that
he
became
engaged
to
mamma
who
was
the
daughter
of
a
very
poor
and
very
proud
captain
in
the
regiment
captain
auriol
our
other
grandfather
liked
but
could
not
bear
his
being
connected
with
any
one
in
trade
and
when
he
gave
his
consent
to
the
marriage
he
said
i
believe
that
he
would
not
have
done
so
had
papa
been
in
his
business
and
that
he
liked
him
all
the
better
for
being
no
longer
his
father
heir
somehow
papa
stepmother
got
to
hear
of
this
engagement
and
knowing
how
poor
mamma
was
and
thinking
papa
would
be
feeling
softened
and
anxious
about
his
future
she
tried
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
mamma
before
she
died
had
come
to
feel
sure
the
poor
woman
did
her
best
she
got
grandpapa
grandpapa
morison
to
write
to
papa
recognising
his
bravery
as
a
soldier
and
speaking
of
his
engagement
and
offering
to
reinstate
him
in
his
old
position
if
he
would
now
allow
that
he
had
had
enough
of
soldiering
and
would
enter
the
business
he
even
said
that
if
he
would
do
so
he
would
still
receive
him
again
him
and
his
wife
when
he
should
be
married
and
make
better
provision
for
him
if
he
would
express
sorrow
for
the
grief
and
disappointment
he
had
caused
him
in
the
past
this
part
of
the
letter
must
have
been
injudiciously
worded
was
said
of
mamma
poverty
which
her
father
and
she
herself
took
offence
at
when
papa
showed
it
them
and
consulted
them
about
it
not
that
he
for
a
moment
dreamt
of
giving
up
his
profession
but
he
softened
and
would
have
been
glad
to
be
friends
again
only
unfortunately
they
took
it
the
other
way
and
he
wrote
back
a
letter
under
grandpapa
auriol
direction
which
offended
his
father
so
deeply
that
things
were
far
worse
than
before
and
it
was
for
this
that
poor
mamma
always
blamed
herself
and
this
was
why
she
said
it
was
for
her
sake
papa
had
quarrelled
with
his
family
it
came
to
be
true
to
some
extent
for
grandpapa
morison
after
that
always
put
all
the
blame
on
her
and
spoke
of
her
very
unkindly
which
came
to
papa
ears
and
made
him
furious
and
when
his
father
died
a
few
years
afterwards
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
even
a
small
portion
had
still
been
left
to
him
and
i
believe
he
would
ever
have
taken
it
poor
as
he
was
but
for
a
message
that
was
sent
him
with
the
news
of
his
father
death
that
poor
grandpapa
had
left
him
his
blessing
before
he
died
believe
that
he
had
to
thank
his
stepmother
for
this
though
she
did
not
appear
in
it
she
must
have
been
frightened
poor
thing
and
no
wonder
so
the
only
communication
was
through
the
lawyer
and
that
i
think
said
nina
with
a
sigh
is
about
all
there
is
to
tell
thank
you
said
arthur
nina
he
went
on
after
a
consideration
do
you
think
lettice
knows
it
all
as
clearly
as
you
do
it
is
her
own
fault
if
she
does
said
nina
which
for
her
was
an
unusually
bitter
speech
she
has
had
just
as
much
opportunity
as
i
have
had
for
hearing
the
whole
except
that
perhaps
and
she
hesitated
a
moment
perhaps
that
from
philip
dexter
i
have
heard
more
than
she
about
how
good
uncle
ingram
is
through
uncle
ingram
having
married
his
aunt
you
know
but
arthur
if
people
see
things
only
one
way
and
lettice
can
turn
it
so
when
she
talks
about
it
she
almost
makes
me
feel
as
if
it
would
be
wrong
and
to
look
at
it
any
other
way
i
know
said
arthur
with
a
still
deeper
sigh
than
nina
had
been
and
indeed
poor
boy
he
know
his
next
remark
surprised
his
sister
i
wonder
he
said
i
wonder
papa
disliked
the
idea
of
business
she
exclaimed
i
do
i
in
earnest
there
is
nothing
i
should
like
so
much
nina
promise
swear
you
wo
tell
any
one
he
went
on
boyishly
but
earnestly
if
i
tell
you
the
truth
i
would
have
given
to
accept
that
offer
i
have
no
wish
to
go
into
the
army
i
do
think
i
a
coward
but
the
life
has
no
attraction
for
me
i
seen
so
much
of
the
other
side
of
it
i
used
to
think
when
papa
was
alive
i
should
like
it
but
now
i
not
clever
nina
i
awfully
in
several
of
the
subjects
i
shall
have
to
be
examined
in
and
oh
nina
the
very
thought
of
an
examination
makes
my
blood
run
cold
i
i
shall
fail
and
but
why
oh
why
arthur
did
you
not
say
all
this
before
cried
nina
pale
with
distress
i
not
that
the
truth
i
a
moral
coward
if
you
like
i
did
not
realise
it
so
strongly
till
godfrey
told
me
of
uncle
offer
and
then
i
felt
how
i
should
like
business
i
think
i
have
a
of
cleverness
that
would
suit
it
i
am
what
is
called
practical
and
methodical
and
i
should
like
the
intercourse
with
different
countries
and
the
of
it
i
suppose
grandfather
tastes
have
come
out
in
me
and
i
should
like
making
money
for
all
of
you
and
for
auriol
who
is
sure
to
be
a
soldier
but
nina
i
not
tell
lettice
think
of
all
she
would
say
that
i
was
false
to
papa
that
i
was
throwing
away
the
expensive
education
that
has
been
so
difficult
to
manage
all
sorts
of
bitter
things
no
i
not
i
have
tried
and
even
at
the
least
hint
of
misgiving
that
i
was
not
fit
for
the
army
oh
nina
i
saw
what
it
would
be
no
i
must
go
through
with
it
till
the
day
that
i
go
up
for
the
examination
and
am
what
said
nina
spun
hopelessly
but
you
will
have
other
chances
i
ca
face
them
i
that
i
could
never
face
it
again
even
now
i
dream
of
it
with
a
sort
of
horror
said
the
poor
boy
raising
his
delicate
haggard
face
and
i
fail
oh
nina
sometimes
i
think
i
shall
drown
myself
arthur
arthur
do
speak
like
that
said
nina
imploringly
shall
tell
lettice
i
will
if
you
like
if
you
are
sure
quite
sure
of
what
you
say
arthur
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm
no
no
nina
you
must
promise
to
tell
no
one
i
must
see
perhaps
i
may
get
on
better
mr
downe
thinks
i
should
pass
if
only
i
were
less
nervous
any
way
we
must
wait
a
while
if
it
gets
bad
i
will
tell
you
first
of
all
and
ask
you
to
tell
lettice
and
we
shall
see
you
again
soon
it
is
april
now
you
will
be
with
us
all
the
summer
oh
arthur
i
do
hope
things
will
go
on
quietly
and
that
lettice
will
not
oppose
godfrey
any
more
they
are
both
so
determined
but
he
has
right
on
his
side
yes
i
know
but
you
know
arthur
she
will
be
of
age
in
less
than
a
year
and
then
if
she
chooses
to
defy
our
guardians
it
may
come
to
our
being
all
separated
for
think
how
many
years
it
will
be
before
the
little
ones
are
of
age
lettice
would
never
do
that
said
arthur
in
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
knows
she
must
give
in
and
she
loves
us
all
too
much
to
go
too
far
of
course
i
know
how
she
loves
us
only
too
much
said
nina
i
wonder
if
it
would
not
have
been
better
if
we
had
had
no
guardians
we
should
have
got
on
very
well
i
dare
say
nina
said
arthur
solemnly
mark
my
words
if
there
had
been
no
one
to
keep
her
in
check
lettice
would
have
grown
more
and
more
and
i
do
know
what
would
have
become
of
us
better
far
have
all
the
discomfort
of
the
last
week
or
two
than
have
risked
anything
like
that
if
i
thought
it
were
over
said
nina
but
you
do
know
how
i
dread
our
life
at
faxleham
and
still
worse
that
lady
i
do
know
what
to
call
her
for
she
ca
be
called
our
governess
chaperone
suggested
arthur
i
suppose
so
but
is
it
awful
to
think
of
her
arthur
could
scarcely
keep
from
laughing
i
think
that
part
of
it
would
be
rather
fun
he
said
i
hope
though
i
by
no
means
sure
of
it
mind
you
but
i
hope
she
still
be
there
when
i
come
that
i
may
see
the
skirmishing
between
her
and
lettice
if
it
is
she
it
be
some
one
else
said
nina
in
a
depressed
tone
godfrey
auriol
said
it
would
be
impossible
absolutely
unheard
of
for
us
to
live
alone
as
lettice
wanted
oh
arthur
i
wish
you
were
going
away
and
poor
nina
allowing
herself
for
once
the
indulgence
of
giving
way
to
her
own
feelings
regardless
of
those
of
others
threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
burst
into
tears
and
though
arthur
did
his
best
to
console
her
it
was
though
not
precisely
from
the
same
cause
with
sad
enough
hearts
that
the
brother
and
sister
lay
down
to
sleep
that
night
there
had
been
much
to
try
them
since
the
day
that
godfrey
auriol
with
nothing
but
good
will
in
his
heart
to
his
young
relatives
had
left
his
chambers
in
lincoln
inn
where
frost
and
fog
were
still
having
it
their
own
way
and
came
over
the
sea
to
the
sunny
brilliant
south
intent
on
advising
and
assisting
the
sad
little
group
he
had
found
things
very
different
from
what
he
expected
and
he
had
gone
back
again
depressed
and
dispirited
doubtful
though
he
had
manfully
stood
out
for
victory
if
he
had
gone
the
right
way
about
it
more
perplexed
and
disgusted
with
himself
than
he
ever
remembered
to
have
been
before
for
he
was
in
every
sense
of
the
word
a
very
successful
man
starting
in
life
with
little
but
a
good
old
name
and
a
clear
and
head
he
was
already
far
on
the
way
to
competency
he
was
made
much
of
in
whatever
society
he
entered
he
was
used
to
being
looked
up
to
and
having
his
opinion
and
advice
asked
he
had
not
married
had
scarcely
ever
been
in
love
never
to
a
fatal
extent
and
had
acquired
a
habit
of
thinking
that
women
were
not
to
be
too
seriously
considered
one
way
or
the
other
take
them
the
right
way
and
there
was
never
any
trouble
to
be
feared
and
now
when
it
came
to
the
test
he
had
ignominiously
failed
for
though
lettice
had
been
obliged
to
give
in
it
had
been
as
she
took
care
to
tell
him
only
to
the
extent
to
which
she
obliged
to
do
so
not
a
jot
further
and
he
had
an
uncomfortable
an
exaggerated
idea
that
he
had
been
rough
what
the
french
call
brutal
to
her
to
her
my
own
cousin
and
an
orphan
too
whom
i
was
prepared
to
care
for
like
a
sister
yes
like
a
sister
that
first
night
when
she
seemed
so
sweet
and
gentle
and
to
think
of
the
things
we
have
said
to
each
other
since
thought
poor
godfrey
during
his
long
solitary
journey
back
again
to
whence
he
had
come
if
lettice
could
have
seen
into
his
heart
i
think
she
would
have
been
moved
to
regret
and
she
had
been
very
unreasonable
the
intentions
of
which
she
had
spoken
no
relation
or
guardian
in
the
world
could
have
approved
of
we
do
not
wish
to
return
to
england
she
told
godfrey
calmly
i
want
to
spend
the
summer
while
it
is
too
hot
here
in
travelling
about
and
next
winter
we
shall
come
back
here
again
and
under
whose
care
mr
auriol
asked
quietly
said
lettice
rearing
her
head
of
course
we
have
old
bertha
who
will
never
leave
us
but
i
am
quite
old
enough
to
take
care
of
my
brothers
and
sisters
may
think
so
do
he
replied
drily
besides
it
is
not
altogether
a
question
of
age
if
you
were
married
i
shall
never
marry
indeed
mr
auriol
observed
with
the
utmost
politeness
but
that
excuse
me
is
a
matter
for
your
private
consideration
in
no
way
interfering
with
what
i
was
saying
if
for
supposition
sake
you
or
let
us
say
nina
who
is
still
younger
and
he
turned
to
nina
with
a
smile
which
somehow
made
the
colour
rise
in
her
cheeks
if
were
married
to
a
reliable
sort
of
man
there
would
be
nothing
against
your
all
living
together
if
you
chose
provided
the
approved
which
in
his
place
would
observed
arthur
in
an
aside
but
as
things
are
why
five
ten
years
hence
even
you
could
not
keep
house
without
a
chaperone
said
mr
auriol
in
conclusion
as
if
the
matter
were
not
open
to
a
question
a
very
short
time
before
he
left
godfrey
told
them
what
he
proposed
as
to
their
future
home
i
have
a
letter
i
should
like
to
read
to
you
he
said
to
lettice
his
tone
and
manner
seemed
to
her
exceedingly
cold
the
truth
was
that
he
was
most
uncomfortably
constrained
certainly
she
replied
do
you
wish
me
to
call
nina
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
said
mr
auriol
and
when
nina
came
he
read
to
them
the
description
that
had
been
sent
to
him
of
a
small
house
a
few
hours
distance
from
town
which
seemed
to
him
just
what
was
wanted
the
neighbourhood
is
very
pretty
and
there
is
an
excellent
school
for
auriol
in
the
small
town
of
garford
at
distance
and
there
are
some
nice
families
in
the
neighbourhood
to
whom
i
to
whom
introductions
could
easily
be
got
in
our
deep
mourning
said
lettice
icily
nothing
of
that
kind
need
be
taken
into
consideration
besides
she
added
if
you
think
us
so
exceedingly
childish
and
unreasonable
i
should
say
the
fewer
acquaintances
we
make
the
better
lettice
oh
please
do
said
nina
imploringly
but
lettice
had
hardened
her
heart
we
to
that
place
she
said
afterwards
to
nina
we
can
not
help
ourselves
for
my
part
i
feel
perfectly
indifferent
as
to
where
we
live
it
is
like
a
choice
of
prisons
simple
endurance
for
the
time
being
it
is
like
taking
medicine
i
will
take
it
because
i
but
i
not
going
to
have
it
dressed
up
with
and
pretend
it
nice
but
what
do
you
mean
by
the
time
being
asked
nina
timidly
to
this
lettice
would
not
reply
perhaps
though
she
would
not
own
it
her
ideas
were
really
vague
on
the
subject
arthur
had
to
be
up
early
the
morning
he
left
and
thanks
to
their
late
talk
the
night
before
nina
overslept
herself
and
lettice
seeing
her
looking
so
tired
and
pale
had
not
the
heart
to
wake
her
she
looked
pale
and
herself
when
arthur
found
her
waiting
to
give
him
his
breakfast
and
he
felt
sorry
for
her
and
perhaps
a
little
for
some
of
the
things
he
had
said
of
her
we
shall
see
you
again
before
long
she
said
for
surely
no
difficulty
will
be
put
in
the
way
of
your
spending
your
holidays
with
us
of
course
not
who
would
dream
of
such
a
thing
he
said
i
do
know
replied
lettice
wearily
everything
has
gone
so
strangely
i
ask
myself
what
next
lettice
said
arthur
simply
do
exaggerate
but
to
make
sure
i
will
speak
of
it
to
godfrey
better
you
than
i
certainly
he
likes
nina
very
much
went
on
arthur
innocently
almost
as
if
thinking
aloud
and
he
thinks
her
so
very
pretty
does
he
did
he
say
so
said
lettice
quickly
and
a
curious
expression
which
arthur
did
not
observe
passed
over
her
face
oh
ever
so
many
times
he
thinks
her
almost
an
angel
i
believe
and
lettice
would
have
liked
to
hear
more
but
there
was
no
time
arthur
you
will
do
your
best
will
you
not
were
her
last
whispered
words
to
her
brother
remember
if
you
do
succeed
it
will
break
my
heart
and
i
believe
in
a
still
lower
voice
it
would
have
broken
papa
and
mamma
a
look
of
intense
pain
came
into
the
poor
boy
eyes
and
he
did
not
speak
then
with
sudden
resolution
he
turned
to
his
sister
yes
he
said
though
his
voice
was
unlike
itself
i
will
do
chapter
five
a
change
in
the
barometer
give
her
a
word
good
or
bad
and
she
spin
such
a
web
from
the
hint
and
colour
a
meaningless
phrase
with
so
vivid
a
lint
it
was
a
lovely
evening
when
the
little
party
arrived
at
their
destination
many
people
had
noticed
them
during
their
long
journey
the
two
pretty
sisters
and
the
children
with
no
one
but
their
old
servant
to
take
care
of
them
for
their
deep
mourning
told
its
own
story
many
a
kindly
heart
thought
pityingly
of
them
and
sent
silent
good
wishes
with
them
on
their
way
there
had
been
some
talk
of
their
staying
a
day
or
two
in
london
in
which
case
mr
auriol
would
have
met
them
but
this
lettice
the
ruling
spirit
vetoed
let
us
get
straight
to
that
place
she
said
and
have
it
over
what
she
meant
nina
did
not
very
well
understand
she
supposed
her
to
refer
to
the
meeting
with
miss
branksome
the
or
chaperone
whom
mr
auriol
had
engaged
and
who
was
to
await
them
at
faxleham
cottage
nina
herself
was
not
without
some
anticipatory
awe
of
this
person
but
it
was
tempered
by
a
strong
feeling
of
pity
and
once
when
she
alluded
to
her
in
speaking
to
lettice
she
was
almost
amazed
to
find
that
her
sister
shared
the
latter
poor
woman
said
lettice
gravely
she
has
undertaken
a
hard
task
i
could
almost
find
it
in
my
heart
to
be
sorry
for
her
nina
could
not
help
smiling
as
she
replied
but
it
need
not
be
a
hard
task
lettice
not
not
unless
make
it
so
for
her
false
positions
are
always
hard
said
lettice
oracularly
she
is
coming
to
take
care
of
us
and
we
do
want
or
need
to
be
taken
care
of
then
a
moment
after
she
surprised
nina
by
asking
her
to
write
to
mr
auriol
to
tell
him
when
they
were
starting
and
when
they
expected
to
reach
faxleham
as
she
had
promised
to
let
him
know
i
am
so
tired
she
said
which
was
an
unusual
confession
and
i
should
be
so
glad
if
you
would
do
it
for
me
besides
he
likes
you
so
much
better
than
me
he
will
be
pleased
to
get
a
letter
from
you
i
do
think
he
really
likes
me
better
said
nina
innocently
i
am
not
clever
enough
for
him
if
he
had
met
you
differently
i
am
sure
he
would
have
liked
you
best
lettice
did
not
answer
but
a
moment
or
two
later
as
she
was
leaving
the
room
she
spoke
again
on
the
same
subject
you
let
me
see
your
letter
before
you
send
it
wo
you
she
said
do
be
afraid
that
i
shall
be
vexed
if
you
write
cordially
i
want
him
to
think
us
ungrateful
it
is
fault
nina
could
scarcely
believe
her
ears
what
could
be
coming
ever
lettice
she
wished
arthur
were
at
hand
to
talk
over
this
wonderful
change
which
she
felt
completely
unable
to
explain
but
it
was
not
nina
way
to
trouble
or
perplex
herself
about
problems
which
as
she
said
to
herself
would
probably
sooner
or
later
solve
themselves
in
this
as
in
most
other
characteristics
she
was
a
complete
contrast
to
her
sister
she
wrote
the
letter
a
pretty
girlish
almost
affectionate
little
letter
it
was
and
brought
it
to
lettice
for
approval
the
elder
sister
read
it
smiling
once
or
twice
in
a
manner
that
would
have
puzzled
nina
had
she
been
given
to
puzzling
yes
said
lettice
it
will
do
very
well
and
she
was
turning
away
when
nina
stopped
her
lettice
she
began
well
i
wanted
to
tell
you
yesterday
when
i
was
out
with
bertha
we
i
met
mr
dexter
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
seen
him
since
our
our
mourning
i
think
it
was
very
inconsiderate
of
him
to
speak
to
you
in
the
street
said
lettice
here
too
where
everything
one
does
is
observed
it
was
only
for
one
instant
said
nina
appealingly
he
asked
me
to
tell
you
they
are
leaving
morning
to
tell
you
that
he
will
call
this
evening
to
say
and
he
hopes
he
may
see
us
lettice
face
had
grown
harder
i
thought
they
were
already
gone
she
said
as
if
speaking
to
herself
then
second
thoughts
intervened
i
suppose
we
must
see
him
i
want
to
be
rude
besides
he
is
a
friend
of
godfrey
yes
perhaps
you
had
better
tell
marianne
that
if
he
calls
she
can
let
him
in
the
permission
was
not
too
gracious
but
it
was
more
than
nina
had
hoped
for
it
is
evidently
for
godfrey
sake
she
reflected
and
yet
when
he
was
here
lettice
was
so
seldom
the
least
pleasant
to
him
philip
did
call
he
was
nervous
and
yet
with
a
certain
determination
about
him
that
impressed
lettice
in
spite
of
herself
and
she
felt
exceedingly
glad
to
hear
him
repeat
that
he
and
his
sister
were
leaving
the
next
morning
i
shall
look
forward
to
seeing
you
again
before
very
long
in
england
he
said
manfully
as
he
got
up
to
go
i
do
know
much
about
our
plans
said
lettice
and
her
tone
was
not
encouraging
we
have
only
taken
a
house
for
the
summer
i
do
know
what
we
shall
do
then
faxleham
is
not
so
very
far
from
my
part
of
the
country
said
philip
is
it
not
said
lettice
suspiciously
and
she
looked
at
mr
dexter
in
a
way
that
made
the
young
man
face
flush
slightly
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
change
colour
almost
as
quickly
as
a
girl
and
whose
good
looks
are
to
themselves
entirely
destroyed
by
their
persistent
boyishness
at
five
and
twenty
he
looked
little
more
than
nineteen
but
i
am
not
likely
to
be
there
for
the
next
twelve
months
he
continued
coldly
and
with
a
certain
dignity
my
place
has
been
let
for
some
years
and
the
lease
will
not
expire
till
the
spring
no
if
i
see
you
at
faxleham
or
elsewhere
i
must
come
expressly
he
looked
at
lettice
and
she
at
him
it
was
a
tacit
throwing
down
of
the
gauntlet
on
his
part
and
angry
as
she
felt
it
yet
made
her
respect
the
young
man
whom
hitherto
she
had
spoken
of
so
contemptuously
as
a
boy
she
bade
him
with
courtesy
not
to
say
friendliness
much
to
nina
relief
and
even
carried
her
attention
so
far
as
to
accompany
him
to
the
door
talking
busily
all
the
time
of
the
details
of
his
journey
so
that
as
she
flattered
herself
there
was
no
opportunity
for
any
last
words
between
him
and
her
sister
and
as
she
went
upstairs
where
bertha
was
already
beginning
the
packing
such
a
sad
packing
the
hundred
and
one
little
possessions
of
their
mother
to
cry
over
and
wonder
what
to
do
with
all
the
belongings
with
which
full
of
the
hopefulness
of
inexperienced
youth
they
had
left
england
in
the
autumn
to
consign
to
the
bottom
of
the
trunks
and
wish
they
could
be
put
out
of
sight
for
ever
she
said
to
herself
not
without
at
her
perspicacity
that
it
was
evidently
time
for
to
be
put
a
stop
to
and
she
would
have
been
strengthened
in
her
opinion
had
she
known
that
at
that
very
moment
nina
leaning
sadly
on
the
balcony
had
not
gone
to
the
door
with
philip
was
cheered
by
the
sight
of
his
face
as
passing
up
the
street
instead
of
down
certainly
not
the
nearest
way
to
his
home
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
on
the
chance
of
seeing
her
again
and
lifting
his
hat
called
out
softly
not
goodbye
but
au
revoir
lettice
wondered
at
nina
good
spirits
that
evening
evidently
she
does
not
as
yet
care
much
about
him
she
was
so
very
young
when
she
first
met
him
how
unfortunate
it
was
and
was
no
doubt
flattered
by
his
attention
but
she
but
see
how
superior
godfrey
auriol
is
how
much
more
of
a
and
then
it
will
be
easy
to
suggest
how
mother
would
have
liked
it
one
of
her
own
name
and
altogether
so
closely
connected
with
her
and
the
imaginary
castle
in
the
air
which
lettice
had
constructed
for
her
sister
happiness
assumed
more
and
more
imposing
and
attractive
proportions
lettice
had
such
faith
in
herself
as
an
architect
she
knew
so
much
better
than
people
themselves
the
sort
of
castle
they
live
and
be
happy
in
so
that
on
side
nina
wondered
at
lettice
improved
spirits
during
the
last
few
days
at
esparto
and
even
through
the
journey
for
besides
the
other
recommendations
of
the
project
she
had
built
upon
such
slender
foundations
lettice
felt
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
magnanimity
in
herself
for
approving
of
and
encouraging
such
an
idea
it
shows
i
am
prejudiced
she
said
to
herself
with
satisfaction
and
if
dear
mamma
could
but
know
it
she
would
see
how
ready
i
am
to
sacrifice
any
personal
feelings
of
mine
when
would
have
been
concerned
for
of
course
though
godfrey
is
not
actually
connected
with
the
morisons
he
has
entirely
ranged
himself
on
their
side
we
have
wandered
a
long
way
from
the
evening
of
the
arrival
at
faxleham
but
perhaps
it
was
necessary
to
explain
how
it
came
to
pass
that
the
outer
sunshine
was
matched
by
greater
inward
serenity
than
might
all
things
considered
have
been
expected
it
was
as
i
said
a
most
lovely
evening
the
drive
from
the
station
at
garford
was
through
pretty
country
lanes
where
the
hedges
were
at
their
freshest
untouched
as
yet
by
summer
dust
and
the
wild
roses
and
honeysuckle
were
already
in
bud
giving
promise
of
their
later
beauty
and
to
the
young
travellers
after
their
several
months
absence
in
different
scenery
the
sweet
homely
beauty
of
their
own
country
was
very
attractive
is
it
not
pretty
so
peaceful
and
yet
bright
just
think
how
mamma
would
have
liked
it
exclaimed
nina
and
though
lettice
did
not
speak
she
pressed
her
sister
hand
sympathisingly
the
children
of
course
were
in
ecstasies
though
once
or
twice
they
glanced
up
at
lettice
half
ashamed
of
their
own
delight
but
she
smiled
back
at
them
so
kindly
that
they
were
quickly
reassured
and
a
whisper
which
she
overheard
of
lotty
gave
her
greater
pleasure
than
she
could
have
expressed
lettice
is
getting
like
mamma
the
child
said
when
she
is
so
kind
she
always
makes
me
think
of
mamma
and
lettice
always
was
kind
when
she
felt
thoroughly
pleased
with
herself
as
she
did
just
now
if
only
her
foundation
had
been
the
rock
of
real
principle
and
not
the
sands
of
passing
moods
and
impulses
do
you
think
lettice
said
nina
in
a
low
voice
venturing
a
little
further
do
you
think
we
are
going
to
be
happy
at
least
peaceful
here
lettice
had
not
the
heart
to
repulse
her
i
shall
be
very
glad
dear
if
you
feel
so
she
said
and
i
am
sure
i
want
to
make
the
best
of
things
if
if
there
were
not
that
unhappy
miss
branksome
looming
in
the
distance
in
the
nearness
rather
i
know
exactly
what
she
will
be
like
i
know
those
decayed
gentlewomen
so
well
tall
and
lank
and
always
having
headaches
and
nerves
and
tears
in
her
eyes
for
nothing
and
yet
everlastingly
interfering
of
course
she
must
interfere
it
her
business
what
she
there
for
but
before
nina
had
time
to
reply
the
carriage
stopped
they
had
reached
their
destination
faxleham
cottage
was
what
its
name
implied
a
real
cottage
it
had
no
drive
or
approach
save
the
simple
little
footpath
leading
from
the
to
the
wide
low
porch
entrance
but
unpretending
as
it
was
an
exclamation
of
pleasure
broke
involuntarily
from
the
lips
of
its
new
tenants
as
they
stepped
out
of
the
carriage
and
entered
the
sweet
trim
and
yet
luxuriant
little
garden
gay
with
early
flowers
not
a
weed
to
be
seen
bright
and
smiling
in
the
soft
evening
sunlight
lettice
too
felt
the
pleasant
influence
how
i
wish
mamma
could
see
it
was
her
unspoken
thought
if
it
were
who
was
to
welcome
us
instead
of
and
as
she
went
forward
she
glanced
before
her
apprehensively
half
expecting
to
see
realised
the
unattractive
personage
she
had
ingeniously
constructed
in
her
imagination
a
lady
was
standing
in
the
porch
and
as
the
came
forward
she
stepped
out
to
meet
them
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
all
safe
she
said
in
a
bright
pleasant
voice
i
must
introduce
myself
but
you
know
who
i
am
miss
branksome
said
nina
always
the
ready
one
on
such
occasions
probably
because
her
mind
was
never
over
occupied
with
herself
or
her
own
concerns
but
with
her
usual
tact
she
stepped
back
a
very
little
leaving
lettice
as
the
eldest
to
shake
hands
first
with
the
and
lettice
to
her
own
surprise
as
she
did
so
found
herself
thinking
how
pretty
she
is
she
is
certainly
like
a
decayed
gentlewoman
miss
branksome
was
very
pretty
some
people
might
think
it
better
to
say
had
been
for
she
was
more
than
she
was
almost
elderly
her
hair
was
perfectly
white
and
her
soft
face
had
the
faint
delicate
pink
flush
that
comes
to
fair
complexions
with
age
so
different
from
the
brilliant
roses
of
youth
her
eyes
were
bright
but
very
gentle
in
expression
and
her
figure
was
daintily
small
she
looks
like
an
old
fairy
nina
said
afterwards
and
the
description
was
not
a
bad
one
everything
that
genuine
kindliness
based
on
thorough
good
principle
and
aided
by
great
natural
tact
could
do
to
make
the
orphans
feel
as
happy
in
their
new
home
as
was
possible
for
them
was
done
by
miss
branksome
that
first
evening
even
lettice
succumbed
to
the
pleasant
influence
it
was
new
for
her
to
be
taken
care
of
even
as
it
were
petted
and
it
came
so
naturally
to
the
bright
active
little
woman
to
make
everybody
about
her
happy
or
at
least
comfortable
that
she
could
not
help
trying
her
hand
on
even
the
redoubtable
miss
morison
as
to
whom
mr
auriol
had
given
her
some
salutary
warning
you
must
be
so
tired
my
dears
she
said
with
the
smiles
and
tears
struggling
together
at
the
same
time
i
thought
you
would
like
tea
better
than
anything
and
perhaps
this
first
evening
would
you
like
me
to
pour
it
out
it
was
perfectly
impossible
to
stand
on
one
dignity
or
to
keep
up
any
prejudice
with
one
so
genuine
and
and
nina
heart
was
relieved
of
an
immense
weight
when
they
all
went
to
bed
that
night
for
some
time
everything
went
better
than
could
have
been
hoped
by
dint
of
her
simple
goodness
by
dint
perhaps
of
in
no
way
planning
or
scheming
to
get
it
miss
branksome
unconsciously
gained
confidence
and
when
mr
auriol
came
down
to
see
his
young
charges
two
or
three
weeks
after
their
arrival
he
was
most
agreeably
surprised
by
the
happy
state
of
things
not
being
above
human
weakness
he
could
not
help
congratulating
himself
on
the
skill
which
he
had
displayed
in
an
undoubtedly
awkward
situation
though
at
the
same
time
he
was
only
too
ready
to
give
credit
to
all
concerned
you
have
done
marvels
he
said
to
miss
branksome
who
had
been
a
friend
of
his
from
his
childhood
they
all
seem
as
fond
of
you
as
possible
not
that
i
had
any
fear
for
nina
or
the
little
ones
only
for
lettice
and
yet
of
all
she
i
think
has
most
gained
my
heart
said
the
little
lady
she
is
so
thorough
there
is
nothing
small
or
ungenerous
about
her
nina
is
very
sweet
but
if
there
is
any
triumph
for
me
or
satisfaction
rather
it
is
certainly
with
regard
to
lettice
i
feel
so
sure
of
her
i
can
not
quite
understand
your
having
found
her
what
you
described
are
you
sure
forgive
me
now
godfrey
are
you
sure
there
was
no
sort
of
prejudice
on
side
godfrey
face
flushed
none
whatever
he
exclaimed
i
met
her
as
free
from
prejudice
from
any
preconceived
idea
even
as
was
possible
and
the
first
time
i
saw
her
i
thought
her
as
charming
and
gentle
as
she
is
personally
attractive
it
all
came
out
when
the
question
of
the
morison
feud
was
raised
it
seemed
to
change
her
very
nature
you
have
not
come
upon
that
as
yet
i
suppose
not
in
the
least
of
course
i
have
no
right
to
do
so
unless
she
does
but
she
knows
that
i
do
not
know
her
uncle
and
aunt
and
that
they
do
not
know
me
i
think
that
has
given
me
an
advantage
with
her
at
first
i
fancied
she
suspected
or
was
ready
to
suspect
that
mr
and
mrs
morison
had
had
to
do
with
my
being
chosen
and
i
was
glad
to
be
able
indirectly
to
let
her
see
they
had
not
mr
auriol
seemed
lost
in
reflection
i
wonder
when
i
should
speak
to
her
to
them
all
about
their
uncle
again
he
said
at
last
he
is
so
very
anxious
for
some
happier
state
of
things
and
he
trusts
to
me
to
bring
it
about
lettice
could
not
be
pleasanter
than
she
is
now
just
like
what
she
was
at
the
very
first
i
wonder
if
i
dare
risk
it
not
yet
said
miss
branksome
at
least
that
is
my
impression
let
her
not
think
that
you
came
down
this
time
with
any
purpose
except
to
see
how
they
all
are
leave
it
all
a
little
longer
to
her
own
good
sense
she
might
commit
herself
to
some
decision
she
would
afterwards
be
ashamed
to
withdraw
from
if
you
spoke
of
it
all
again
before
she
has
had
time
thoroughly
to
consider
it
mr
auriol
shrugged
his
shoulders
she
has
had
time
enough
it
seems
to
me
he
said
however
i
know
you
are
wiser
than
i
just
at
that
moment
lettice
and
nina
joined
them
in
the
garden
we
are
going
to
fetch
auriol
home
from
school
said
lettice
would
you
come
with
us
she
added
looking
up
at
her
cousin
certainly
with
the
greatest
pleasure
he
said
and
the
three
set
off
but
they
had
not
gone
far
when
lettice
stopped
and
hesitated
if
you
wo
think
me
rude
for
changing
my
mind
she
said
i
think
i
would
rather
not
go
i
want
to
write
to
arthur
nina
looked
at
her
in
surprise
and
a
slight
look
of
annoyance
crossed
mr
auriol
face
but
lettice
did
not
see
it
of
course
it
does
matter
said
nina
but
i
think
you
need
be
in
such
a
very
great
hurry
about
writing
to
arthur
i
want
to
write
lettice
repeated
and
i
know
mr
auriol
wo
mind
and
she
smiled
so
pleasantly
that
the
annoyance
left
his
face
she
is
an
odd
girl
he
thought
to
himself
however
it
is
as
well
perhaps
that
my
walk
is
to
be
with
nina
and
not
with
her
i
might
have
been
tempted
to
try
the
ground
again
in
spite
of
miss
branksome
advice
and
might
have
done
more
harm
than
good
with
nina
i
am
quite
safe
and
so
far
as
nina
was
concerned
the
result
of
their
talk
was
perfectly
satisfactory
it
was
with
a
more
hopeful
feeling
than
he
had
yet
had
on
the
subject
that
mr
auriol
the
cottage
on
their
return
from
the
walk
to
gardon
he
and
nina
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
porch
they
did
not
notice
that
lettice
was
at
an
open
window
above
whence
she
could
clearly
see
them
and
for
a
moment
or
two
godfrey
stood
with
nina
hand
in
his
her
fair
face
in
which
was
more
colour
than
usual
raised
towards
him
you
may
depend
on
me
she
said
softly
to
do
all
i
can
there
is
nothing
really
nothing
almost
that
i
wish
so
earnestly
i
am
sure
of
it
said
godfrey
perhaps
indeed
he
added
with
a
little
hesitation
i
understand
more
about
what
you
feel
than
you
think
not
that
i
think
you
are
selfish
dear
nina
i
think
you
one
of
the
most
unselfish
people
i
ever
knew
and
he
hesitated
still
more
this
time
he
will
be
a
happy
man
who
wins
you
nina
face
was
crimson
by
now
but
she
stood
by
her
cousin
a
moment
longer
he
was
leaving
the
next
morning
and
it
might
be
her
last
chance
of
seeing
him
alone
then
i
am
to
do
what
i
can
and
in
a
sort
of
way
to
report
progress
you
will
come
down
again
in
two
or
three
weeks
yes
and
in
the
meantime
i
shall
see
arthur
and
then
he
released
her
hand
and
she
ran
upstairs
to
take
off
her
hat
have
you
had
a
nice
walk
dear
said
lettice
who
was
waiting
in
their
room
said
nina
heartily
i
think
you
and
godfrey
are
getting
to
understand
each
other
wonderfully
lattice
remarked
yes
said
nina
with
a
happy
little
laugh
i
almost
think
so
too
and
lettice
observing
the
flush
on
her
face
congratulated
herself
on
her
generalship
she
is
evidently
forgetting
all
about
philip
dexter
she
thought
how
pretty
she
looks
how
nice
it
must
be
to
be
so
sweet
and
attractive
not
hard
and
cold
and
repellent
like
me
but
it
is
on
me
and
though
she
told
herself
things
were
going
just
as
she
wished
there
was
a
little
sigh
in
her
heart
as
she
kissed
her
sister
on
their
way
downstairs
chapter
six
a
cavalier
reception
fell
his
warm
wishes
chilled
by
wintry
fear
and
resolution
sicken
at
the
view
as
near
the
moment
of
decision
drew
dante
but
things
seldom
turn
out
as
even
the
most
reasonable
people
expect
much
more
than
two
or
three
weeks
elapsed
before
godfrey
auriol
came
down
to
faxleham
again
this
was
owing
to
a
complication
of
circumstances
unusual
pressure
of
business
on
him
for
one
thing
lotty
morison
catching
the
measles
for
another
and
the
difficulties
in
the
way
were
yielded
to
more
easily
than
might
have
been
the
case
had
the
same
urgency
existed
for
bringing
matters
to
a
decision
but
mr
ingram
morison
and
his
wife
were
early
in
the
summer
obliged
to
go
for
several
months
to
an
part
of
ireland
where
some
of
mrs
morison
family
lived
on
account
of
sudden
and
serious
trouble
among
them
so
the
question
he
and
indeed
she
too
had
so
much
at
heart
was
left
dormant
for
the
time
and
nina
heard
no
more
except
a
few
words
of
explanation
which
godfrey
enclosed
to
her
in
a
letter
to
miss
branksome
it
is
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
any
good
perhaps
had
he
known
it
godfrey
did
not
lose
in
the
good
graces
of
his
cousins
during
these
rather
dull
and
monotonous
weeks
nina
for
more
reasons
than
one
longed
to
see
him
and
would
have
made
him
most
heartily
welcome
had
he
appeared
and
even
lettice
though
she
had
sturdily
refused
all
offers
of
introductions
to
any
families
in
the
neighbourhood
would
in
her
heart
have
been
glad
of
some
break
in
the
tranquil
round
of
their
daily
life
she
was
disappointed
too
that
godfrey
did
not
seem
more
eager
to
see
nina
again
and
there
were
times
when
nina
rather
troubled
and
anxious
expression
made
her
tremble
for
the
success
of
her
scheme
if
that
philip
dexter
were
to
appear
just
now
there
is
no
saying
what
influence
he
might
again
acquire
over
her
she
said
to
herself
it
is
very
stupid
of
godfrey
but
he
came
at
last
though
not
till
arthur
holidays
were
more
than
half
over
and
the
lanes
were
no
longer
without
their
summer
coating
of
dust
for
it
was
an
unusually
dry
season
the
rain
could
not
be
far
off
however
for
the
law
of
average
required
that
the
drought
should
be
compensated
for
there
must
be
a
break
in
the
weather
soon
said
mr
auriol
the
evening
of
his
arrival
and
i
suppose
rain
will
be
welcome
when
it
comes
but
if
it
is
not
selfish
i
hope
it
will
hold
off
for
two
days
i
have
felt
so
tired
of
london
in
my
life
as
during
the
last
three
weeks
and
i
do
want
to
enjoy
my
breath
of
country
air
i
am
afraid
you
wo
get
much
air
even
here
remarked
arthur
cheerfully
it
has
been
stifling
these
two
or
three
days
something
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
struck
his
cousin
and
he
glanced
up
at
him
you
do
look
very
bright
yourself
my
boy
he
said
you
not
been
working
too
hard
i
hope
he
been
working
rather
hard
even
during
the
holidays
said
lettice
though
not
without
a
certain
complacence
in
her
tone
you
know
arthur
is
not
merely
to
cousin
godfrey
he
is
to
come
off
with
flying
colours
but
in
the
meantime
the
colour
is
all
flying
out
of
his
face
said
godfrey
kindly
and
with
concern
that
wo
do
and
nina
whose
own
face
had
grown
paler
during
this
conversation
was
startled
on
looking
at
her
brother
to
see
how
white
almost
ghastly
he
had
grown
she
was
helping
lettice
with
afternoon
tea
which
in
these
fine
days
they
were
fond
of
having
under
a
big
tree
on
the
little
lawn
and
she
made
some
excuse
for
sending
arthur
to
the
house
on
an
errand
they
will
all
think
there
is
something
the
matter
she
whispered
to
him
if
you
look
like
that
though
in
her
heart
she
would
scarcely
have
regretted
anything
which
would
have
brought
to
an
end
the
unhappiness
which
she
felt
convinced
arthur
was
enduring
though
she
had
not
succeeded
in
getting
him
again
to
confide
in
her
as
he
had
done
that
last
evening
at
esparto
arthur
is
really
looking
ill
godfrey
went
on
and
he
seems
so
dull
and
quiet
of
course
i
have
seen
too
little
of
him
to
judge
and
the
last
time
there
was
every
reason
for
his
looking
very
depressed
but
even
then
he
had
not
the
same
dull
hopeless
look
he
must
either
be
ill
or
but
that
is
impossible
what
said
lettice
coldly
i
was
going
to
say
he
looks
as
if
he
had
something
on
his
mind
lettice
smiled
with
a
sort
of
contemptuous
superiority
he
something
on
his
mind
she
said
as
every
one
might
understand
he
is
exceedingly
anxious
to
do
more
than
well
at
his
examination
and
he
is
perhaps
working
a
too
hard
mr
auriol
was
silent
for
a
moment
when
he
spoke
again
he
did
not
seem
to
be
addressing
any
one
in
particular
i
do
feel
satisfied
about
him
he
said
shortly
lettice
face
flushed
i
do
not
see
mr
auriol
that
you
need
feel
uneasy
about
him
if
do
not
she
said
it
is
impossible
to
judge
of
any
one
you
know
so
little
of
course
naturally
arthur
is
unusually
anxious
to
do
well
he
knows
it
would
half
break
heart
if
he
failed
he
knows
what
matters
far
more
that
it
would
have
been
a
most
bitter
disappointment
to
my
father
and
mother
it
is
enough
to
make
him
serious
mr
auriol
glanced
up
quickly
were
they
were
your
father
and
mother
so
very
desirous
that
he
should
go
into
the
army
he
said
i
should
rather
have
thought
but
here
he
stopped
i
wish
you
would
say
all
you
mean
said
lettice
curtly
i
have
no
objection
whatever
to
doing
so
except
the
fear
of
annoying
he
replied
i
was
going
to
say
that
remembering
his
own
experience
i
should
have
thought
your
father
the
very
last
man
to
force
or
even
advise
a
profession
unless
the
lad
himself
thoroughly
liked
it
it
exclaimed
lettice
really
surprised
and
nina
added
hastily
oh
no
while
papa
was
alive
there
was
no
question
but
that
arthur
wished
it
while
papa
was
alive
nina
repeated
lettice
what
do
you
mean
you
speak
as
if
arthur
did
not
wish
it
nina
blushed
painfully
and
seemed
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that
she
said
at
last
and
lettice
too
prepossessed
by
her
own
wishes
and
beliefs
to
take
in
the
possibility
of
any
others
thought
no
more
of
nina
agitation
but
mr
auriol
did
not
forget
it
he
was
however
painfully
anxious
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
his
cousins
as
to
their
relations
with
their
uncle
mr
morison
was
now
at
home
again
and
eager
to
receive
his
nephews
and
nieces
and
to
discuss
with
them
the
best
arrangements
for
a
permanent
home
which
he
and
his
wife
earnestly
hoped
would
be
if
not
with
at
least
near
them
but
though
he
had
plenty
of
opportunities
for
talks
with
nina
he
tried
in
vain
to
have
any
uninterrupted
conversation
with
lettice
she
almost
seemed
to
avoid
it
purposely
and
he
disliked
to
ask
for
it
in
any
formal
and
ceremonious
way
though
i
shall
be
forced
to
do
so
he
said
to
nina
one
day
when
as
usual
he
found
himself
alone
with
her
lettice
having
made
some
excuse
at
the
last
minute
for
not
going
out
with
them
do
you
think
she
avoids
me
on
purpose
nina
he
asked
with
some
irritation
i
really
do
not
know
said
nina
sometimes
i
do
not
understand
lettice
at
all
i
fear
i
rubbed
her
the
wrong
way
that
first
day
by
the
way
i
spoke
of
arthur
said
godfrey
reflectively
and
arthur
too
baffles
me
i
have
tried
to
talk
to
him
and
to
lead
him
on
to
confide
in
me
if
he
has
anything
on
his
mind
but
it
is
no
use
so
i
must
just
leave
him
for
the
present
but
about
this
other
matter
i
must
do
and
say
something
it
is
not
my
own
concern
i
have
promised
to
see
about
it
nina
listened
with
great
sympathy
and
great
anxiety
i
wish
i
could
do
anything
she
said
but
i
too
have
tried
in
vain
lettice
seems
to
avoid
the
subject
well
then
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
meet
it
formally
i
must
ask
lettice
to
give
me
half
an
hour
and
i
will
read
her
your
uncle
last
letter
there
she
is
he
added
hurriedly
pointing
to
a
figure
which
suddenly
appeared
in
the
lane
a
short
way
before
them
so
she
has
been
out
after
all
where
have
you
been
lettice
asked
nina
as
they
came
up
with
her
for
she
was
walking
slowly
i
thought
you
were
not
coming
out
i
changed
my
mind
said
lettice
i
have
been
some
little
way
on
the
garford
road
the
words
were
slightly
defiant
but
the
tone
was
subdued
and
nina
looking
at
her
sister
was
struck
by
the
curious
expression
of
her
face
it
had
a
distressed
almost
a
frightened
look
what
could
it
be
mr
auriol
intent
on
his
own
ideas
did
not
notice
it
lettice
he
began
i
never
seem
to
see
you
at
leisure
and
i
must
leave
the
day
after
when
can
you
give
me
half
an
hour
any
time
you
like
any
time
i
mean
said
lettice
it
is
too
late
this
evening
very
well
he
said
just
as
you
like
lettice
was
longing
to
get
away
to
be
alone
in
her
own
room
to
think
over
what
had
happened
and
what
she
had
done
that
afternoon
she
had
not
meant
to
go
out
after
refusing
to
walk
with
nina
and
her
cousin
but
lotty
had
come
to
ask
her
advice
about
a
little
garden
she
was
making
and
after
this
important
business
was
settled
lettice
feeling
at
a
loss
what
to
do
with
herself
strolled
a
short
way
down
the
road
it
was
too
soon
to
meet
nina
and
mr
auriol
they
would
not
be
back
for
an
hour
at
least
and
arthur
was
as
usual
shut
up
in
his
own
room
with
his
books
who
then
could
the
figure
be
whom
she
saw
when
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
house
coming
quickly
up
the
road
it
was
not
godfrey
nor
arthur
and
yet
it
was
but
seldom
that
any
one
not
making
for
the
cottage
came
along
this
road
which
for
half
a
mile
or
so
was
almost
like
a
private
one
and
then
too
yes
it
did
seem
to
lettice
that
there
was
something
familiar
about
the
walk
and
carriage
of
the
gentleman
she
now
clearly
perceived
to
be
such
though
he
was
still
too
far
off
for
her
to
distinguish
his
features
another
moment
or
two
and
she
no
longer
hesitated
it
was
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
it
was
the
person
whom
of
all
others
she
most
dreaded
to
see
philip
dexter
and
yet
there
was
nothing
very
alarming
in
the
young
man
appearance
as
on
catching
sight
of
her
he
hastened
his
steps
and
came
on
hurriedly
his
features
lit
up
with
eagerness
while
lettice
walked
more
and
more
slowly
at
every
step
growing
more
dignified
and
icy
the
smile
faded
from
philip
face
as
he
distinguished
her
clearly
miss
morison
he
exclaimed
i
saw
you
some
way
off
but
i
was
not
sure
i
thought
you
thought
i
was
my
sister
probably
said
lettice
calmly
as
she
held
out
her
hand
i
too
saw
you
some
way
off
mr
dexter
and
at
first
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
eyes
are
you
staying
anywhere
near
here
no
said
philip
braced
by
her
coldness
to
an
equal
composure
i
have
no
acquaintances
close
to
this
i
came
by
rail
to
garford
and
left
my
portmanteau
at
the
hotel
there
and
walked
on
here
i
have
come
miss
morison
on
purpose
to
see
you
not
me
personally
said
lettice
raising
her
eyebrows
yes
you
personally
though
not
you
i
am
i
think
glad
to
have
met
you
alone
if
that
is
your
house
for
they
were
approaching
the
cottage
will
you
turn
and
walk
back
a
little
i
would
rather
talk
to
you
a
little
first
before
any
one
knows
i
am
here
with
the
greatest
readiness
though
she
strove
to
conceal
it
lettice
agreed
they
retraced
their
steps
down
the
road
and
then
she
led
him
along
a
lane
to
the
left
also
in
the
garford
direction
though
she
knew
that
by
it
mr
auriol
and
nina
could
return
i
will
not
beat
about
the
bush
miss
morison
said
philip
i
have
come
to
see
nina
to
ask
her
to
marry
me
i
would
have
done
so
already
last
winter
at
esparto
but
your
mother
illness
the
difficulty
of
seeing
any
of
you
the
latter
part
of
the
time
interfered
and
i
thought
it
for
other
reasons
too
better
to
wait
nina
has
no
father
and
mother
you
are
not
much
older
but
you
the
eldest
and
i
know
you
have
immense
influence
over
her
before
seeing
her
i
should
like
to
know
my
ground
with
you
do
you
wish
me
well
in
face
of
this
straightforward
address
lettice
felt
for
a
moment
off
her
guard
you
have
never
consulted
me
hitherto
she
said
evasively
that
is
not
the
question
now
said
philip
tell
me
do
you
wish
me
well
and
still
more
do
you
do
you
think
i
am
likely
to
succeed
at
this
lettice
looked
up
at
him
i
do
know
she
said
and
she
spoke
honestly
almost
the
only
thing
i
am
sure
of
is
that
i
wish
you
had
not
thought
of
it
not
come
here
philip
bright
handsome
face
fell
he
looked
in
a
moment
years
older
you
think
there
is
something
in
the
way
i
see
he
said
ah
well
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
make
sure
i
must
see
nina
herself
where
is
she
she
is
out
said
lettice
and
her
face
flushed
she
is
out
walking
with
godfrey
auriol
something
in
her
tone
and
expression
made
philip
stop
short
and
look
at
her
sharply
she
bore
his
look
unflinchingly
and
that
perhaps
impressed
him
more
than
her
words
she
was
able
to
do
so
for
she
was
not
conscious
of
deceiving
him
she
deceived
herself
her
determined
prejudice
and
blinded
her
to
all
but
their
own
tendencies
and
conclusions
mr
dexter
eyes
dropped
at
this
same
moment
there
flashed
before
his
memory
the
strangely
enthusiastic
tone
with
which
godfrey
had
spoken
of
as
philip
thought
that
first
morning
at
esparto
his
face
was
very
pale
when
he
looked
up
again
miss
morison
lettice
he
said
you
do
not
like
me
but
you
are
incapable
of
misleading
me
you
think
there
is
something
between
nina
and
mr
auriol
he
is
very
fond
of
her
said
lettice
i
do
not
know
exactly
but
i
think
you
think
she
returns
it
lettice
bowed
her
head
in
agreement
then
i
will
go
as
i
came
and
no
one
need
know
anything
about
my
having
been
said
philip
you
will
tell
no
one
not
if
you
wish
me
not
to
do
so
certainly
not
she
replied
only
too
delighted
to
be
as
she
said
to
herself
to
conceal
his
visit
i
very
earnestly
beg
you
not
to
tell
of
it
he
said
it
could
serve
no
purpose
things
being
as
you
say
they
are
lettice
made
a
little
movement
as
if
she
would
have
interrupted
him
then
she
hesitated
at
last
i
did
not
exactly
was
all
she
got
out
no
you
did
not
exactly
in
so
many
words
say
is
engaged
or
just
going
to
be
to
godfrey
auriol
but
you
have
said
all
you
and
i
thank
you
for
your
honesty
it
must
have
been
difficult
for
you
disliking
me
and
knowing
that
i
you
dislike
me
to
have
been
honest
philip
spoke
slowly
as
if
weighing
every
word
something
in
his
manner
in
his
white
almost
ghastly
face
appalled
lettice
mr
dexter
she
exclaimed
involuntarily
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
i
do
think
i
do
dislike
you
and
she
felt
that
never
before
had
she
been
so
near
liking
and
certainly
respecting
the
young
man
but
you
know
all
the
feelings
involved
i
am
very
very
sorry
it
should
have
gone
so
far
with
you
yet
i
could
not
have
warned
you
sooner
last
winter
it
would
have
been
impossible
i
had
no
reason
to
think
there
was
anything
so
serious
last
winter
repeated
philip
i
do
understand
you
there
was
no
to
warn
me
off
then
before
she
had
ever
seen
him
i
had
all
the
field
to
myself
you
do
suppose
i
am
giving
it
up
now
out
of
deference
to
that
shameful
wicked
nonsense
of
prejudice
and
dig
like
to
the
best
man
in
the
world
your
uncle
and
mine
as
i
am
proud
to
call
him
and
philip
gave
a
bitter
and
contemptuous
laugh
i
am
going
away
because
i
see
i
have
no
chance
i
esteem
and
admire
godfrey
auriol
too
much
to
enter
into
useless
rivalry
with
him
he
is
not
likely
to
care
for
any
woman
in
vain
but
if
i
had
not
been
so
afraid
of
hurting
you
last
winter
if
i
had
thrown
all
the
prejudice
to
the
winds
i
believe
i
might
have
won
her
godfrey
would
have
come
between
us
had
he
had
any
idea
of
how
it
was
with
me
so
after
all
it
that
wicked
unchristian
nonsense
that
has
done
it
all
you
may
think
it
is
right
you
can
not
expect
to
agree
with
you
at
the
same
time
i
repeat
that
i
thank
you
for
your
honesty
can
i
reach
garford
by
this
way
and
philip
in
a
white
fever
of
indignation
and
most
bitter
disappointment
turned
to
go
lettice
had
never
perhaps
in
all
her
life
felt
more
discomposed
mr
dexter
she
said
do
leave
me
like
this
do
be
so
angry
with
me
i
have
tried
to
do
rightly
by
you
too
i
have
not
denied
it
but
i
can
not
stand
and
discuss
it
as
if
it
were
anything
else
i
am
only
human
i
must
go
i
am
afraid
of
of
meeting
tell
me
is
this
the
right
way
yes
replied
lettice
mechanically
straight
on
brings
you
out
on
the
road
again
it
is
a
short
cut
philip
raised
his
hat
and
before
lettice
had
time
for
another
word
had
she
indeed
known
what
to
say
he
was
gone
she
stood
and
looked
after
him
for
some
moments
with
a
blank
expression
and
then
retracing
her
steps
she
walked
slowly
back
and
thus
came
to
be
observed
by
her
sister
and
godfrey
returning
in
the
other
direction
it
was
not
a
happy
moment
for
mr
auriol
to
choose
for
his
renewed
attempt
lettice
slept
badly
and
woke
in
the
morning
feverish
and
excited
but
by
way
perhaps
of
shifting
the
misgiving
and
which
insinuate
themselves
more
blindly
determined
than
ever
to
stand
to
her
colours
she
listened
to
her
uncle
letter
and
to
all
mr
auriol
had
to
say
and
then
quietly
announced
her
decision
nothing
could
induce
her
to
regard
as
a
relation
the
man
who
had
supplanted
her
father
the
representative
of
the
unnatural
family
who
had
treated
him
all
his
life
long
as
a
pariah
and
an
outcast
and
had
been
the
cause
of
sorrows
and
trials
without
end
to
him
and
her
mother
i
am
the
eldest
she
said
i
can
remember
more
distinctly
than
the
others
the
privations
and
trials
they
went
through
at
the
very
time
when
my
father
father
and
brother
were
rolling
in
riches
some
part
of
which
by
every
natural
law
should
have
been
his
and
some
part
of
which
his
said
godfrey
everything
he
had
came
from
his
father
and
why
it
was
not
more
was
his
own
fault
he
would
not
take
it
neither
will
i
said
lettice
crimsoning
what
my
father
accepted
and
left
to
us
i
considers
ours
but
i
will
take
no
more
in
any
shape
directly
or
indirectly
then
said
godfrey
also
losing
his
you
had
better
give
up
all
you
have
for
is
surely
as
i
stand
here
you
would
not
as
i
have
already
explained
to
you
have
had
one
farthing
left
but
for
what
ingram
morison
did
and
risked
you
owe
to
him
lettice
turned
upon
him
very
pale
now
you
may
some
day
repent
taunting
me
so
cruelly
with
what
i
am
in
no
way
responsible
for
she
said
godfrey
recognising
the
truth
of
this
tried
to
make
her
better
understand
him
but
it
was
useless
i
must
bear
it
for
the
present
was
all
she
would
say
and
nina
heard
her
mutter
something
to
herself
about
once
i
am
of
age
which
made
her
still
more
uneasy
i
have
done
more
harm
than
good
said
godfrey
at
last
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
he
glanced
at
nina
and
arthur
but
neither
spoke
lettice
saw
the
glance
we
are
all
of
one
mind
she
said
proudly
are
we
not
nina
are
we
not
arthur
nina
eyes
filled
with
tears
arthur
was
very
pale
you
know
lettice
said
nina
at
all
costs
we
must
cling
together
and
lettice
preferred
not
to
press
her
more
closely
and
godfrey
auriol
returned
to
town
the
next
morning
chapter
seven
a
tramp
in
the
snow
there
is
no
dearth
of
kindness
in
this
world
of
ours
only
in
our
blindness
we
gather
thorns
for
flowers
gerald
massey
a
very
cold
winter
morning
colder
than
is
often
the
case
before
christmas
and
christmas
was
still
some
days
off
snow
had
fallen
in
the
night
and
while
some
weather
optimists
were
maintaining
that
on
this
account
it
would
feel
warmer
now
others
more
experienced
if
less
hopeful
were
prophesying
a
much
heavier
fall
before
night
what
lay
on
the
ground
was
but
the
precursor
of
much
more
the
family
party
round
the
breakfast
table
in
the
pretty
rectory
of
thorncroft
were
discussing
the
question
from
various
points
of
view
if
it
would
stop
snowing
now
and
go
on
freezing
till
the
end
of
the
holidays
so
that
we
could
have
skating
all
the
time
then
i
care
what
it
does
after
said
tom
a
typical
youth
of
fourteen
to
be
met
with
it
seems
to
me
in
at
least
six
of
every
seven
english
country
families
no
said
ralph
his
younger
brother
i
rather
it
go
on
snowing
for
about
a
week
so
that
we
could
have
lots
of
i
like
that
better
than
skating
there
would
be
much
of
you
or
tom
left
to
skate
or
snowball
either
if
it
went
on
snowing
for
a
week
we
be
snowed
up
bodily
remarked
their
father
have
you
forgotten
grandpapa
stories
for
thorncroft
was
in
an
part
of
the
country
all
hills
and
valleys
where
were
not
altogether
legend
but
independently
of
that
i
do
like
you
to
talk
quite
so
thoughtlessly
either
heavy
snow
or
hard
frost
long
prolonged
brings
terrible
suffering
and
the
clergyman
sighed
as
he
rose
from
the
table
and
walked
over
to
the
window
where
he
stood
looking
out
for
a
few
moments
without
speaking
i
must
tell
cook
to
begin
the
winter
soup
at
once
said
the
mother
speaking
to
her
eldest
daughter
for
in
this
family
there
was
a
sort
of
private
soup
kitchen
in
severe
weather
independently
of
charity
to
their
own
parishioners
for
the
benefit
of
poor
waifs
and
strays
many
of
whom
passed
this
way
on
their
tramp
to
the
northern
towns
which
they
were
too
poor
to
attain
by
the
railway
it
was
an
old
custom
and
had
never
been
found
productive
of
abuse
yes
replied
the
young
girl
for
i
am
sure
the
weather
is
going
to
be
dreadful
shall
i
go
and
speak
about
it
mamma
do
dear
your
father
may
want
me
for
a
few
minutes
daisy
left
the
room
but
only
to
reappear
again
very
shortly
with
a
troubled
face
papa
mamma
she
said
there
is
a
tramp
at
the
door
now
he
seems
nearly
fainting
and
cook
says
he
must
have
been
out
in
the
snow
all
night
there
is
no
soup
ready
might
i
have
a
cup
of
tea
for
him
certainly
said
her
mother
run
one
of
you
boys
for
a
kitchen
cup
it
will
taste
just
as
good
and
i
do
like
to
risk
one
of
my
dear
old
china
ones
mamma
said
daisy
in
a
low
voice
she
was
always
a
little
afraid
of
the
boys
laughing
at
her
i
do
think
it
would
have
mattered
about
the
cup
do
you
know
he
looks
quite
like
a
gentleman
her
father
who
was
standing
near
overheard
the
last
words
he
had
been
reading
a
letter
which
he
threw
aside
there
is
nothing
from
ingram
he
remarked
to
his
wife
i
had
hoped
for
a
letter
i
am
so
sorry
for
him
just
at
christmas
time
again
the
old
disappointment
but
what
is
daisy
saying
the
young
girl
repeated
what
she
had
told
her
mother
and
ralph
just
then
appearing
with
a
substantial
cup
and
saucer
mrs
winthrop
poured
out
the
tea
and
daisy
carrying
it
went
off
with
her
father
to
the
kitchen
door
a
you
say
daisy
he
repeated
yes
papa
and
quite
young
cook
says
she
is
sure
he
is
a
gentleman
and
added
her
father
oh
no
at
least
i
do
think
so
he
just
knocked
at
the
door
and
asked
if
he
might
warm
himself
at
the
fire
and
she
said
he
looks
so
ill
i
did
not
quite
see
him
i
just
peeped
in
well
wait
a
moment
i
speak
to
him
first
said
her
father
for
by
this
time
they
had
traversed
the
long
passage
which
led
to
the
kitchen
and
offices
the
rectory
at
thorncroft
was
a
large
roomy
old
house
and
the
winthrops
were
rich
and
so
saying
the
clergyman
went
in
to
have
a
look
at
the
stranger
almost
immediately
daisy
waiting
at
the
door
heard
herself
called
quick
my
child
the
hot
tea
he
is
nearly
fainting
poor
fellow
and
daisy
hurrying
in
saw
her
father
half
lifting
on
to
a
chair
a
tall
thin
figure
with
white
face
and
closed
eyes
while
cook
stood
by
looking
very
frightened
and
perhaps
not
altogether
pleased
at
this
desecration
of
her
spotless
kitchen
for
the
snow
melted
by
the
heat
was
running
off
the
stranger
in
little
rivulets
he
was
only
however
they
made
him
swallow
the
tea
and
sent
for
another
cup
into
which
mrs
winthrop
put
a
spoonful
of
brandy
then
the
young
man
sat
up
and
looked
about
him
confusedly
recognising
that
he
was
among
strangers
he
thanked
them
earnestly
for
their
kindness
and
struggling
to
his
feet
said
that
he
must
be
going
on
going
on
my
good
fellow
said
mr
winthrop
you
are
not
fit
for
it
you
must
stay
here
an
hour
or
two
at
least
and
get
dried
and
have
something
to
eat
have
you
far
to
go
the
young
man
coloured
i
wanted
to
get
to
clough
he
said
it
is
ten
days
since
i
started
i
got
on
well
enough
though
it
has
been
horribly
cold
and
he
shivered
as
he
thought
of
it
till
last
night
were
you
out
in
the
snow
asked
the
rector
compassionately
not
all
night
oh
no
i
sheltered
in
a
barn
till
early
this
morning
then
it
looked
as
if
it
were
clearing
and
i
set
off
again
i
was
anxious
to
get
on
as
far
as
i
could
before
it
came
on
again
but
i
lost
my
way
i
think
there
was
moonlight
at
first
but
since
daylight
i
have
been
wandering
about
not
able
to
find
the
road
am
i
far
from
the
to
clough
not
very
you
must
have
taken
the
wrong
turn
a
couple
of
miles
off
we
are
accustomed
to
people
tramps
he
was
going
to
have
said
but
he
changed
the
word
in
time
making
that
mistake
now
you
had
better
take
off
your
wet
things
and
get
them
dried
and
have
something
to
eat
and
if
you
must
go
on
we
will
set
you
on
your
way
and
here
the
good
rector
hesitated
you
seem
very
young
he
went
on
if
i
can
give
you
any
counsel
remember
it
is
my
business
to
do
so
the
young
fellow
coloured
up
again
painfully
you
are
very
kind
sir
he
said
think
it
over
i
will
see
you
again
peters
he
called
and
a
brimful
of
curiosity
appeared
this
again
an
almost
imperceptible
hesitation
this
young
gentleman
has
lost
his
way
take
him
to
master
tom
old
room
and
help
him
to
change
his
things
we
must
find
you
a
change
while
they
are
drying
he
went
on
but
the
young
fellow
held
up
a
small
bag
he
had
been
carrying
i
have
other
things
thank
you
he
said
but
i
should
be
most
thankful
to
have
these
dried
mr
winthrop
rejoined
daisy
and
her
mother
he
is
a
gentleman
is
he
not
papa
said
the
former
eagerly
he
strikes
me
as
more
of
a
schoolboy
than
anything
else
i
hope
he
has
not
run
away
in
any
sort
of
disgrace
still
whatever
it
is
one
must
be
kind
to
him
poor
boy
he
is
evidently
not
accustomed
to
roughing
it
and
as
far
as
one
could
see
through
the
plight
he
was
in
he
seemed
well
dressed
i
hope
he
will
tell
me
something
about
himself
the
worst
of
the
predictions
were
realised
before
noon
the
snow
came
down
again
this
time
in
most
sober
earnest
and
long
before
dark
mr
winthrop
becoming
convinced
that
they
were
in
for
it
began
to
take
some
necessary
precautions
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
the
young
stranger
to
pursue
his
his
kind
host
insisted
on
his
remaining
where
he
was
for
the
night
though
somewhat
embarrassed
as
to
how
to
treat
him
i
can
not
bring
a
complete
stranger
in
among
our
own
children
he
said
to
his
wife
and
yet
it
seems
impossible
to
tell
him
to
sit
with
the
servants
but
the
difficulty
was
solved
by
the
young
man
unfitness
to
leave
his
room
he
had
caught
a
chill
and
was
besides
suffering
from
exhaustion
both
nervous
and
physical
seems
to
me
to
have
had
a
shock
of
some
kind
and
evidently
very
little
food
for
some
days
past
said
the
doctor
whom
mr
winthrop
was
obliged
to
send
for
the
next
morning
it
may
go
on
to
rheumatic
fever
or
he
may
being
young
and
healthy
enough
fight
it
off
but
any
way
got
him
on
your
hands
for
two
or
three
days
unless
you
like
to
get
a
vehicle
of
some
kind
and
send
him
to
the
hospital
at
clough
said
the
doctor
pitying
the
inconvenience
to
mrs
winthrop
it
would
be
a
great
risk
would
it
not
said
the
rector
yes
certainly
it
would
be
a
risk
still
you
are
not
obliged
to
give
to
every
benighted
wanderer
said
the
doctor
smiling
but
mr
winthrop
felt
certain
this
was
no
common
case
and
his
kindness
was
rewarded
thanks
to
the
care
and
nursing
he
received
the
dreaded
illness
was
warded
off
and
by
the
fourth
day
the
young
stranger
was
well
enough
to
pursue
his
journey
i
can
never
thank
you
enough
for
your
goodness
to
me
an
utter
stranger
he
said
to
his
host
with
the
tears
in
his
eyes
and
i
feel
so
ashamed
so
but
here
he
broke
down
altogether
my
poor
boy
said
the
rector
can
you
not
give
me
your
confidence
why
are
you
wandering
about
the
world
alone
like
this
i
can
not
believe
you
have
done
anything
wrong
at
least
seriously
wrong
if
you
have
left
your
friends
hastily
for
some
reason
it
may
not
be
too
late
to
return
can
i
do
anything
to
help
you
can
i
write
to
your
father
so
as
to
put
things
straight
again
i
have
no
father
and
no
mother
said
the
lad
no
i
have
done
nothing
wrong
nothing
disgraceful
in
the
usual
sense
i
mean
but
i
have
done
wrong
in
another
way
i
have
disappointed
every
hope
and
effort
that
had
been
made
for
me
and
i
can
not
face
the
result
i
can
not
tell
you
all
for
if
i
did
you
would
probably
think
it
your
duty
to
interfere
it
is
all
so
complicated
and
confused
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
i
am
going
off
like
whittington
he
added
with
a
faint
smile
to
seek
my
fortune
and
if
i
find
it
it
will
not
be
mine
i
owe
it
to
others
that
is
the
worst
of
it
and
where
do
you
think
of
going
in
the
first
place
asked
mr
winthrop
to
hexton
said
the
young
man
naming
the
town
he
had
been
making
for
before
his
misadventure
and
from
there
to
liverpool
i
thought
i
would
try
in
liverpool
to
get
something
to
do
and
if
i
did
not
succeed
i
thought
perhaps
i
would
go
to
america
and
how
would
you
get
there
have
you
money
i
have
a
little
that
i
left
behind
me
in
the
charge
of
a
friend
to
send
after
me
with
my
clothes
when
i
get
to
liverpool
i
thought
it
better
not
to
carry
it
with
me
i
might
have
been
robbed
or
and
here
he
smiled
again
the
same
wintry
little
smile
that
seemed
so
pathetic
on
his
thin
young
face
tempted
to
spend
it
perhaps
and
have
you
any
one
to
go
to
at
liverpool
any
introductions
of
any
kind
no
one
none
whatever
answered
the
poor
boy
sadly
mr
winthrop
reflected
a
moment
i
may
be
able
to
be
of
a
little
use
to
you
in
that
way
at
least
i
might
be
if
i
knew
even
a
little
more
about
you
you
can
not
tell
me
your
name
the
young
man
coloured
and
looked
down
i
can
not
he
said
i
thought
it
all
over
and
i
determined
that
my
only
chance
was
to
tell
nothing
no
sir
you
can
not
help
me
but
i
thank
you
as
much
as
if
you
had
and
thus
mr
winthrop
was
forced
to
let
him
go
at
the
last
moment
an
idea
struck
him
he
gave
the
boy
a
few
words
of
introduction
to
an
old
friend
of
his
in
liverpool
a
friend
though
in
a
different
rank
of
life
the
son
of
a
farmer
in
the
neighbourhood
now
holding
a
respectable
position
in
a
business
house
there
telling
him
all
or
rather
the
exceedingly
little
he
knew
of
the
stranger
who
had
been
three
days
his
guest
and
asking
him
if
under
the
circumstances
he
could
do
anything
to
help
to
do
it
at
the
same
time
he
said
to
the
young
man
i
really
do
not
know
that
this
will
be
of
any
service
i
can
not
ask
mr
simcox
to
take
any
responsibility
in
the
matter
you
have
not
even
told
me
your
name
i
know
that
replied
the
youth
dejectedly
but
i
can
not
help
it
i
can
not
expect
others
to
take
me
on
trust
as
generously
as
you
have
done
and
so
saying
he
set
off
on
his
lonely
journey
with
kindly
words
from
daisy
and
her
mother
the
two
boys
accompanying
him
to
the
the
snow
still
lay
on
the
ground
and
tom
wish
for
a
prolonged
frost
seemed
likely
to
be
fulfilled
we
shall
have
splendid
skating
in
a
day
or
two
he
remarked
to
the
gentleman
tramp
as
he
and
ralph
had
dubbed
the
stranger
our
pond
is
very
big
but
it
very
good
ice
generally
you
should
see
the
lake
at
uncle
ingram
the
best
place
i
know
for
skating
in
england
the
young
man
started
at
the
name
tom
mentioned
did
you
say
he
asked
at
my
uncle
ingram
mr
morison
said
tom
it
a
long
way
from
here
but
your
name
is
morison
how
can
he
be
your
uncle
why
his
wife
is
our
aunt
he
married
mamma
sister
uncles
are
often
uncles
that
way
said
tom
with
an
air
of
superior
wisdom
of
course
said
the
young
man
how
stupid
of
me
well
do
be
stupid
about
losing
your
way
again
said
the
boy
patronisingly
look
here
now
here
the
you
nothing
to
do
but
go
straight
on
for
some
hours
two
or
three
and
when
you
come
to
a
place
where
four
roads
meet
you
see
marked
on
a
you
can
easily
get
there
thank
you
thank
you
much
said
the
stranger
and
as
the
boys
turned
from
him
please
thank
your
father
and
mother
again
for
me
he
called
out
after
them
he
must
be
a
gentleman
said
ralph
he
speaks
quite
like
one
of
course
he
is
said
tom
but
he
rather
queer
he
was
so
stupid
about
uncle
ingram
i
wonder
what
he
left
his
friends
for
said
ralph
sagely
he
got
a
cruel
stepmother
that
starved
and
beat
him
like
you
know
nonsense
reproved
tom
that
all
fairy
story
rubbish
and
you
know
papa
says
it
very
wrong
to
talk
about
cruel
stepmothers
and
that
you
not
to
read
any
more
fairy
stories
if
you
mix
them
up
with
real
or
pursued
ralph
sublimely
indifferent
to
this
reproof
it
might
have
been
a
cruel
uncle
like
the
babes
in
the
uncle
and
not
a
fairy
story
he
threw
at
tom
triumphantly
many
a
true
word
is
spoken
in
jest
little
thought
the
two
boys
as
they
made
their
way
back
over
the
crisp
glittering
snow
to
the
happy
cheerful
rectory
how
the
words
uncle
my
uncle
ingram
kept
ringing
in
the
ears
of
the
solitary
traveller
but
little
older
than
they
as
he
pursued
his
weary
journey
for
in
a
sense
it
was
truly
from
an
uncle
or
the
distorted
image
of
one
that
he
was
fleeing
uncle
ingram
to
be
uncle
how
extraordinary
he
kept
saying
to
himself
and
how
near
i
was
more
than
once
to
telling
my
name
if
i
had
supposing
i
had
got
very
ill
and
delirious
and
had
told
it
it
would
all
have
come
out
it
would
not
have
been
my
fault
lettice
could
not
have
reproached
me
or
written
me
any
more
of
those
dreadful
letters
and
a
sigh
almost
a
shiver
of
suffering
went
through
him
as
he
thought
of
them
if
i
had
died
they
would
have
had
to
hunt
among
my
things
and
they
would
have
found
my
name
i
think
it
would
have
been
better
perhaps
lettice
would
have
been
sorry
any
way
it
would
have
come
to
an
end
and
poor
nina
would
have
been
happier
lettice
could
not
speak
to
her
as
she
has
done
to
me
but
i
must
not
begin
thinking
i
must
go
on
with
it
now
he
had
no
misadventures
that
day
and
reached
the
town
he
was
bound
for
by
the
evening
there
he
looked
about
till
he
saw
a
modest
little
inn
where
he
put
up
for
the
night
remembering
mr
winthrop
advice
to
play
no
tricks
with
himself
in
such
severe
weather
and
when
still
not
fully
recovered
from
his
exposure
to
the
snowstorm
it
was
the
day
but
one
before
christmas
poor
arthur
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
he
sat
trying
to
warm
himself
on
a
bench
at
some
little
distance
from
the
fire
in
the
rough
room
of
the
inn
where
a
motley
enough
company
of
small
farmers
from
the
neighbourhood
some
of
the
inferior
grades
of
commercial
travellers
one
or
two
nondescript
figures
looking
like
wandering
showmen
and
a
few
others
were
assembled
some
talking
some
silent
mostly
smoking
and
all
getting
as
near
the
fire
as
they
could
for
it
was
again
bitterly
cold
what
a
contrast
from
last
christmas
then
ill
though
their
mother
was
she
had
not
seemed
much
worse
than
she
had
been
for
long
and
had
done
her
utmost
to
be
cheerful
for
her
children
sake
arthur
recalled
the
pleasant
little
at
the
villa
martine
the
bright
sunshine
and
lovely
blue
sky
for
the
short
though
often
even
in
those
climates
sharp
winter
had
not
set
in
till
january
which
almost
seemed
to
laugh
at
the
usual
associations
of
christmas
his
brighter
hopes
too
for
he
had
not
yet
realised
his
distaste
and
unfitness
for
his
chosen
profession
and
even
if
misgiving
had
now
and
then
crossed
his
mind
there
was
his
mother
to
confide
in
should
it
ever
take
form
i
believe
mamma
would
have
been
so
hard
on
me
he
said
to
himself
she
might
have
been
disappointed
but
she
would
have
thought
me
disgraced
for
life
oh
why
did
she
not
live
till
this
was
past
she
would
have
been
sorry
for
me
she
would
not
have
blamed
me
so
but
then
she
did
not
know
all
about
the
money
to
think
as
lettice
says
that
all
my
education
has
in
reality
been
paid
for
by
the
man
we
ca
or
wo
be
even
commonly
civil
to
it
is
the
most
miserable
complication
not
that
it
matters
now
to
he
would
be
so
ready
to
treat
me
as
his
son
now
that
i
turned
out
such
a
fool
and
worse
than
a
fool
lots
of
fools
get
on
well
enough
and
nobody
finds
out
they
are
fools
but
must
needs
go
and
make
an
exhibition
of
myself
and
my
folly
and
he
positively
writhed
at
the
remembrance
however
that
part
of
it
is
at
an
end
i
use
no
more
of
his
money
and
if
i
live
to
make
any
of
my
own
the
first
thing
do
will
be
to
repay
what
i
have
used
though
without
the
least
idea
of
all
this
then
his
thoughts
wandered
off
again
to
the
happy
family
he
had
just
left
how
kind
they
had
been
to
him
how
gladly
had
they
had
the
slightest
notion
of
who
he
was
would
they
have
made
him
welcome
to
pass
his
christmas
among
them
mrs
winthrop
especially
whom
as
his
sister
he
thought
of
with
a
peculiar
interest
how
gentle
and
motherly
she
was
and
doubtless
his
aunt
was
just
the
same
ah
sighed
arthur
again
if
lettice
could
but
have
seen
things
differently
i
would
not
have
been
where
i
am
i
might
have
given
up
the
attempt
in
time
before
i
had
disgraced
myself
i
might
but
his
further
reflections
were
cut
short
by
a
voice
beside
him
it
came
from
a
burly
personage
who
had
without
arthur
noticing
so
absorbed
had
he
been
in
his
reflections
installed
himself
on
the
bench
at
his
side
puffing
away
busily
and
contentedly
at
a
clay
pipe
he
had
not
hitherto
spoken
but
had
sat
still
looking
about
him
with
a
pair
of
shrewd
but
not
unkindly
eyes
and
whur
with
a
broad
accent
may
you
be
boun
young
man
he
inquired
better
bide
at
home
say
i
by
such
weather
if
so
be
as
one
not
forced
to
be
on
the
roads
chapter
eight
a
friend
in
need
i
sure
it
winter
fairly
burns
arthur
started
he
brushed
hastily
away
the
tears
that
lingered
in
his
eyes
hoping
that
the
had
not
observed
them
i
i
he
began
then
hesitated
a
little
i
on
my
way
to
liverpool
i
want
to
go
to
america
ameriky
said
the
old
man
that
a
long
way
have
ye
friends
there
arthur
shook
his
head
he
did
not
care
about
this
and
had
he
reflected
a
little
he
would
not
perhaps
have
answered
so
openly
but
he
was
inexperienced
and
unaccustomed
to
be
on
his
guard
he
tried
to
think
of
some
observation
to
make
which
would
turn
the
conversation
but
nothing
came
into
his
head
except
the
subject
which
never
fails
the
weather
do
you
think
it
is
going
to
snow
again
he
said
timidly
glancing
up
at
his
companion
he
looked
something
like
a
farmer
of
the
humbler
class
farmers
were
always
interested
in
the
weather
the
man
raised
his
head
quickly
as
if
to
look
up
forgetting
seemingly
that
he
was
not
in
the
open
air
then
he
smiled
a
little
ca
say
he
replied
but
i
rather
think
we
had
the
worst
of
it
for
a
while
and
so
ye
off
to
ameriky
young
man
you
do
look
so
fit
for
it
nayther
i
going
to
liverpool
first
said
arthur
perhaps
i
stay
there
i
have
an
introduction
there
he
was
going
on
to
say
but
the
words
stopped
on
his
lips
they
sounded
far
too
important
under
the
circumstances
besides
and
for
the
first
time
this
new
difficulty
struck
him
he
dare
not
avail
himself
of
mr
winthrop
letter
which
he
had
been
so
glad
of
the
person
to
whom
it
was
addressed
was
pretty
sure
to
be
in
some
way
connected
directly
or
indirectly
with
his
uncle
business
and
even
if
not
so
when
mr
winthrop
came
to
hear
of
his
arthur
disappearance
he
might
identify
him
with
the
traveller
they
had
so
kindly
received
and
trace
him
through
this
very
introduction
and
as
all
this
went
through
his
mind
his
face
fell
his
companion
who
was
watching
him
saw
the
change
of
expression
you
have
you
were
saying
you
have
friends
at
liverpool
he
said
arthur
began
to
feel
irritated
at
his
pertinacity
he
had
not
had
much
experience
of
the
curiosity
of
many
whose
quiet
uneventful
lives
force
them
into
gossip
as
their
only
attainable
excitement
but
looking
up
at
the
face
beside
him
his
annoyance
disappeared
and
in
its
place
came
a
sudden
impulse
of
confidence
no
he
said
bluntly
i
have
no
friends
there
nor
indeed
anywhere
whom
i
can
ask
for
help
i
have
neither
father
nor
mother
i
want
to
earn
my
living
and
in
time
if
i
can
to
do
more
than
that
and
not
proud
i
do
anything
and
i
be
more
grateful
than
i
can
say
to
any
one
who
put
me
in
the
way
of
something
the
farmer
sat
silent
he
puffed
away
at
his
pipe
and
between
the
puffs
he
took
a
good
look
now
and
again
at
his
companion
the
rather
thin
young
face
was
flushed
now
the
beautiful
brown
eyes
sparkled
with
excitement
it
was
a
very
attractive
face
very
no
doubt
of
that
and
james
and
eliza
think
a
deal
o
that
he
murmured
to
himself
but
arthur
did
not
catch
the
words
he
sat
without
speaking
he
had
no
idea
of
help
coming
from
his
present
companion
he
had
no
notion
of
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
his
thoughts
were
wandering
far
away
and
he
started
when
the
farmer
with
a
preliminary
cough
to
attract
his
attention
again
spoke
to
him
you
set
on
liverpool
i
thinking
he
began
arthur
did
not
at
once
understand
his
meaning
i
going
to
liverpool
i
intend
to
go
there
he
said
and
you
on
it
the
farmer
repeated
no
other
place
be
to
your
fancy
i
suppose
oh
said
arthur
taking
in
his
meaning
no
i
do
particularly
care
about
liverpool
indeed
i
rather
think
i
should
like
anywhere
else
better
for
he
realised
that
through
the
information
which
might
not
improbably
be
got
sooner
or
later
from
mr
winthrop
liverpool
would
be
the
first
place
in
which
he
would
be
sought
said
the
farmer
i
had
no
reason
for
choosing
liverpool
arthur
went
on
it
was
on
the
way
to
america
i
suppose
that
was
why
i
thought
of
it
he
added
innocently
just
so
ejaculated
his
companion
then
after
a
few
more
puffs
at
his
pipe
and
a
few
more
scrutinising
glances
at
arthur
between
times
he
proceeded
with
what
he
had
to
say
he
had
a
daughter
it
appeared
married
to
a
draper
draper
of
the
little
town
of
greenwell
not
many
miles
off
she
or
her
husband
or
both
of
them
were
in
search
of
a
young
man
to
help
in
the
shop
and
they
had
confided
their
anxieties
to
their
father
knowing
that
he
had
a
journey
of
some
days
to
make
and
there
was
no
saying
but
what
he
might
come
across
the
person
they
were
looking
for
eliza
she
wo
have
none
of
the
lads
thereabouts
he
explained
they
and
eliza
she
thinks
a
deal
o
genteelness
does
eliza
it
strikes
me
young
man
you
please
her
for
that
and
be
a
good
home
if
you
were
honest
and
industrious
here
he
stopped
and
looked
at
his
companion
arthur
face
was
still
redder
than
before
a
he
said
to
himself
a
but
aloud
he
only
said
quietly
i
do
know
anything
whatever
of
the
sort
of
work
it
would
be
does
not
your
need
some
one
who
knows
something
about
it
the
farmer
scratched
his
head
you
can
write
a
good
hand
i
thinking
he
said
and
you
can
soon
learn
how
to
make
out
the
accounts
it
not
that
it
who
to
speak
for
you
and
he
looked
up
again
more
scrutinisingly
than
heretofore
in
arthur
face
it
did
not
grow
the
less
red
on
that
account
i
have
no
one
to
speak
for
me
he
replied
haughtily
so
there
no
use
thinking
about
it
all
the
same
he
went
on
recollecting
himself
i
thank
you
very
much
very
much
indeed
i
very
tired
and
i
think
go
to
bed
and
rising
he
held
out
his
hand
with
the
gentle
courtesy
innate
in
him
to
the
farmer
who
grasped
it
heartily
in
his
horny
palm
with
a
friendly
good
night
i
see
ye
in
the
mornin
mebbe
he
said
it
not
the
weather
nor
yet
the
time
o
year
for
too
early
a
start
it
something
to
have
any
one
to
say
night
to
thought
arthur
as
he
mounted
the
narrow
staircase
to
the
stuffy
little
bedroom
he
had
with
some
difficulty
secured
to
himself
for
the
night
and
the
tears
again
welled
up
though
he
tried
hard
to
ignore
them
he
slept
soundly
for
some
hours
for
he
was
thoroughly
tired
but
he
woke
early
and
lay
anxiously
turning
over
things
in
his
mind
should
he
try
for
the
situation
the
farmer
had
spoken
of
true
there
was
the
difficulty
of
no
references
but
arthur
practical
sense
had
thought
of
a
way
out
of
that
he
had
some
money
very
little
with
him
but
a
few
pounds
he
had
left
with
his
clothes
and
other
small
possessions
in
the
safe
keeping
of
a
young
man
whom
he
knew
he
could
depend
upon
to
keep
secret
this
was
a
former
servant
in
the
family
of
arthur
tutor
and
when
obliged
through
an
accident
to
leave
his
place
some
kindness
young
morison
had
shown
him
had
completely
gained
his
heart
i
could
write
to
dawson
to
send
my
box
on
to
greenwell
or
the
name
of
the
place
he
said
to
himself
then
i
could
give
the
genteel
eliza
some
money
to
keep
as
a
sort
of
guaranty
to
be
given
back
to
me
when
they
were
satisfied
i
was
not
a
thief
and
arthur
laughed
perhaps
because
it
was
better
than
crying
i
believe
that
would
do
away
with
all
difficulties
and
once
i
am
settled
it
would
be
something
to
be
able
to
write
to
lettice
and
tell
her
that
disgraced
as
i
am
i
have
still
found
something
to
do
and
that
i
earning
my
own
livelihood
already
his
face
flushed
though
with
honest
pride
this
time
i
should
have
preferred
her
to
think
me
in
america
his
thoughts
went
on
but
it
would
be
wrong
to
leave
them
in
anxiety
so
long
at
least
if
they
still
think
me
worth
being
anxious
about
any
way
they
will
be
glad
to
know
i
am
alive
and
well
he
had
already
since
his
flight
written
twice
to
his
sisters
twice
since
the
terrible
day
when
morally
convinced
of
his
failure
he
had
altogether
lost
heart
and
fainted
in
his
place
among
the
candidates
though
the
examination
was
but
half
over
he
had
written
confessing
the
whole
his
nervous
terror
of
the
ordeal
his
utter
incapacity
to
face
more
his
thorough
unfitness
for
the
profession
he
had
no
wish
to
enter
and
announcing
at
the
same
time
his
determination
henceforth
to
depend
on
himself
alone
and
to
work
till
he
could
repay
the
obligation
to
their
uncle
of
which
lettice
in
her
mistaken
idea
of
keeping
up
his
spirit
had
so
often
reminded
him
i
am
not
a
coward
he
had
said
in
one
of
these
letters
though
lettice
may
say
i
am
i
have
only
been
a
coward
in
one
thing
in
my
fear
of
telling
the
truth
which
i
thought
would
so
horribly
distress
her
i
dreaded
her
reproaches
and
i
still
dread
them
but
i
shall
no
longer
deserve
them
i
at
least
will
make
my
own
way
and
some
day
i
may
be
able
to
do
something
for
all
of
you
and
in
the
meantime
you
will
all
be
better
and
happier
without
the
brother
who
has
disappointed
you
so
sadly
and
these
letters
he
had
sent
through
the
same
agency
that
of
poor
dawson
so
that
there
was
no
or
mark
of
any
kind
to
betray
his
present
quarters
and
so
his
thoughts
went
on
that
dreary
morning
in
the
little
stuffy
bedroom
if
he
did
not
accept
the
chance
so
unexpectedly
thrown
in
his
way
what
was
he
to
do
he
dared
not
make
use
of
his
letter
to
mr
winthrop
friend
he
dared
hardly
go
to
liverpool
for
he
was
beginning
to
gain
experience
he
saw
that
without
references
of
any
kind
he
might
get
into
awkward
predicaments
might
be
suspected
of
having
run
away
in
disgrace
of
some
very
different
kind
from
the
failure
which
he
himself
judged
so
severely
and
that
would
be
horrible
thought
the
poor
boy
to
be
taken
up
as
a
suspicious
character
and
a
scandal
about
it
and
to
have
to
go
home
and
go
on
living
on
uncle
ingram
money
after
all
and
feel
that
every
one
connected
with
me
was
ashamed
of
me
no
i
must
see
what
that
old
fellow
has
to
say
if
he
has
thought
better
of
it
he
a
good
old
chap
i
sure
his
resolution
had
not
time
to
cool
for
the
farmer
had
slept
upon
it
to
some
purpose
he
greeted
arthur
with
friendly
good
nature
and
without
his
needing
to
broach
the
subject
started
it
himself
again
he
was
on
his
way
home
and
had
promised
to
stop
with
eliza
and
james
over
christmas
as
greenwell
was
only
a
few
hours
from
his
own
village
and
he
proposed
to
arthur
to
accompany
him
to
take
a
look
at
the
place
like
so
being
as
he
had
naught
better
to
do
with
hisself
and
to
let
them
take
a
look
at
me
added
arthur
smiling
it
very
good
of
you
indeed
it
more
than
good
of
you
he
added
to
trust
a
perfect
stranger
and
one
that
ca
tell
you
all
about
himself
either
it
was
family
troubles
that
have
made
me
leave
my
home
but
that
all
i
can
say
there
no
lack
o
troubles
nowheer
said
the
farmer
and
there
no
need
o
telling
what
no
one
business
but
one
own
but
continued
arthur
if
your
mr
i
do
think
you
told
me
his
name
lamb
james
lamb
replied
the
old
man
if
mr
lamb
engages
me
i
can
give
him
a
sort
of
a
pledge
for
my
honesty
any
way
i
have
a
little
money
i
can
send
for
and
i
could
give
it
into
his
keeping
for
a
while
the
farmer
face
cleared
that
not
a
bad
idea
he
said
not
but
what
i
knows
an
honest
face
when
i
sees
one
but
james
he
might
think
me
i
had
a
lad
my
own
onst
he
went
on
with
an
unusual
gentleness
in
his
voice
and
i
lost
him
many
years
ago
now
eliza
she
were
the
daughter
o
my
wife
that
is
just
about
thy
age
my
lad
relapsing
into
the
second
person
singular
as
he
grew
more
at
ease
seems
to
me
he
favoured
thee
a
bit
but
eliza
and
james
they
mebbe
laugh
at
me
for
an
old
fool
so
mighty
glad
about
the
money
i
wo
write
for
it
yet
said
arthur
i
better
wait
till
we
get
to
greenwell
and
see
how
things
turn
out
i
left
it
with
my
clothes
and
other
things
with
a
friend
to
send
after
me
just
so
said
the
farmer
oh
as
for
that
it
be
time
enough
an
hour
or
two
later
saw
arthur
in
company
with
his
new
friend
mounted
in
the
light
of
the
latter
and
driving
though
at
a
sober
pace
for
the
roads
were
very
slippery
in
the
direction
of
the
little
town
of
greenwell
it
was
a
long
drive
they
stopped
towards
midday
at
a
little
roadside
inn
for
some
refreshment
in
the
shape
of
and
beer
and
then
jogged
on
again
it
was
not
a
luxurious
mode
of
travelling
still
it
was
much
better
than
tramping
through
the
snow
and
arthur
days
of
roughing
it
had
taught
him
the
useful
lesson
of
being
thankful
for
small
boons
but
as
the
early
winter
dusk
fell
it
grew
colder
and
colder
and
arthur
shivered
though
he
had
a
good
thick
coat
and
the
farmer
had
given
him
a
plentiful
share
of
the
rough
which
did
duty
for
a
carriage
rug
christmas
eve
he
said
after
a
long
silence
hardly
aware
that
he
was
speaking
aloud
ay
so
said
his
companion
the
years
they
comes
and
the
years
they
goes
is
many
a
christmas
eve
and
christmas
day
as
i
mind
on
earth
goodwill
to
men
parson
tells
us
they
been
it
a
sight
o
christmases
seems
to
me
but
we
a
long
way
off
it
still
i
afeard
i
afraid
so
said
arthur
with
a
sigh
and
then
his
thoughts
wandered
off
again
to
his
home
lettice
would
hear
those
same
words
morning
how
would
they
strike
her
was
she
not
wrong
wrong
was
the
question
that
came
over
and
over
again
for
the
thousandth
time
in
his
mind
could
it
be
showing
true
honour
to
their
dead
parents
to
persist
in
the
course
she
was
doing
a
course
setting
at
defiance
the
divine
injunction
nay
even
allowing
they
or
their
father
rather
had
been
injured
unfairly
treated
was
there
not
divine
command
for
such
cases
too
forgive
as
ye
would
be
forgiven
unto
seventy
times
seven
were
the
words
that
floated
about
before
the
boy
eyes
illuminated
as
it
were
on
the
sky
in
front
of
him
and
who
was
it
they
were
refusing
to
forgive
one
who
had
never
injured
them
one
who
had
generously
taken
upon
him
responsibilities
and
risks
he
was
in
no
way
called
upon
to
trouble
himself
with
ah
yes
thought
arthur
sadly
that
has
been
his
crime
in
her
eyes
his
very
goodness
and
somehow
he
felt
less
unhappy
and
perplexed
when
he
allowed
himself
to
recognise
this
than
when
he
strove
as
he
had
thought
himself
bound
to
do
against
his
better
judgment
to
think
lettice
right
to
accept
the
arguments
she
had
so
plausibly
brought
to
bear
upon
him
she
must
be
wrong
he
thought
and
if
i
had
been
older
and
wiser
or
at
least
more
courageous
i
might
have
made
her
care
to
see
it
but
what
right
have
i
to
speak
miserable
failure
that
i
am
i
can
only
do
what
i
am
doing
be
faithful
and
loyal
to
her
even
if
she
is
mistaken
and
do
my
utmost
to
lessen
the
burden
and
with
another
sigh
arthur
shook
himself
out
of
his
reverie
cold
it
was
growing
are
we
near
there
he
inquired
not
so
far
now
said
the
old
man
cheerily
be
good
seeing
a
bright
fire
and
a
bite
of
supper
the
old
woman
that
my
wife
none
so
very
old
nayther
will
be
lookin
out
for
us
she
were
to
come
to
eliza
like
so
as
we
might
have
our
christmas
together
the
will
have
been
ready
this
three
weeks
i
make
no
doubt
she
a
rare
housekeeper
is
my
eliza
though
i
says
it
as
should
and
arthur
was
boy
enough
to
feel
considerable
satisfaction
in
the
prospect
of
even
though
served
in
homely
guise
it
was
a
long
way
better
than
christmas
day
on
the
road
or
in
some
poor
lodging
in
loneliness
and
dreariness
in
a
few
minutes
more
the
farmer
turned
off
the
road
they
had
for
some
time
been
following
and
shortly
after
this
twinkling
lights
began
to
be
visible
in
the
distance
there
were
not
many
travellers
of
any
kind
about
it
was
too
cold
for
all
not
forced
to
do
so
to
expose
themselves
to
the
open
air
and
when
at
last
after
rattling
over
the
stones
of
an
street
the
farmer
drew
up
at
a
door
evidently
the
private
entrance
to
a
shuttered
shop
next
it
arthur
really
felt
that
he
could
hardly
have
endured
a
quarter
of
an
hour
more
of
it
the
mere
thought
of
a
fire
was
felicity
and
he
did
not
need
twice
bidding
to
jump
down
and
knock
lustily
at
the
door
but
before
it
was
opened
a
misgiving
seized
him
had
i
not
better
go
somewhere
else
for
the
night
he
asked
his
old
friend
they
not
expecting
me
i
dare
say
i
can
get
a
bed
somewhere
near
and
then
by
the
morning
you
will
have
told
them
about
me
the
farmer
ejaculated
something
which
was
evidently
meant
as
an
equivalent
to
nonsense
d
think
now
james
or
eliza
turn
a
dog
to
the
door
such
a
night
as
this
much
less
a
christian
he
replied
reassuringly
seein
too
that
it
as
brings
you
he
added
just
as
the
door
opened
for
the
next
minute
or
two
there
was
a
chatter
of
rather
noisy
welcome
questions
made
and
asked
women
voices
and
men
laughter
then
arthur
feeling
himself
confused
and
dazed
conscious
of
almost
nothing
but
the
numbing
cold
for
he
was
not
yet
as
strong
as
usual
found
himself
in
a
large
comfortable
though
plainly
furnished
room
with
a
great
fireplace
at
one
end
in
which
a
great
fire
was
burning
he
still
heard
the
voices
going
on
about
him
though
at
a
little
distance
and
he
had
an
instinctive
feeling
that
they
were
talking
about
him
he
stood
irresolute
uncertain
whether
to
turn
back
or
go
forward
when
a
kindly
voice
caught
his
ear
come
near
the
fire
i
sure
you
freezing
cold
eliza
that
pleased
to
see
her
father
again
she
sees
no
one
else
james
not
shook
hands
with
but
to
be
sure
my
old
man
not
told
us
your
name
yet
arthur
smiled
it
would
not
have
been
easy
for
the
farmer
to
tell
his
name
when
he
had
never
heard
it
himself
he
tried
to
collect
his
thoughts
but
he
still
felt
very
and
strange
my
name
he
began
is
john
john
morris
which
so
far
as
it
went
was
true
i
wish
you
would
call
me
john
surely
replied
james
as
in
response
to
his
hint
he
shook
hands
so
heartily
as
to
make
him
wince
with
the
young
stranger
you
kindly
welcome
and
if
so
be
as
it
suits
you
to
stay
on
with
us
i
do
doubt
but
as
we
pull
together
but
he
confided
to
his
eliza
afterwards
that
though
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
his
having
a
very
genteel
appearance
he
was
by
no
means
sure
that
this
young
fellow
whom
her
father
had
picked
up
would
be
strong
enough
for
the
place
nevertheless
we
give
him
a
good
christmas
dinner
and
cheer
him
up
a
bit
he
looks
sadly
pulled
down
like
poor
fellow

charlotte
bronte
about
a
week
before
the
cold
evening
of
arthur
drive
with
the
old
farmer
in
his
cart
to
greenwell
late
one
afternoon
a
young
lady
in
deep
mourning
might
have
been
seen
getting
out
of
the
train
at
a
certain
station
in
london
she
was
alone
and
she
had
no
luggage
except
a
little
bag
which
she
carried
and
yet
as
the
train
was
an
express
one
not
stopping
at
stations
near
at
hand
it
was
clear
that
she
had
come
from
some
distance
a
porter
on
the
alert
for
embarrassed
lady
travellers
quickly
called
a
cab
for
her
looking
disappointed
at
no
trunks
being
forthcoming
but
needlessly
so
as
he
received
a
liberal
amount
of
coppers
for
the
small
service
he
had
rendered
this
rather
unusual
generosity
made
him
give
more
attention
than
he
generally
had
time
to
bestow
on
travellers
to
the
tall
slight
figure
the
thick
veil
which
she
wore
blew
aside
for
an
instant
as
she
got
into
the
cab
and
he
saw
that
she
was
very
young
very
pretty
and
evidently
in
trouble
for
her
eyes
showed
traces
of
recent
tears
poor
thing
said
the
porter
to
himself
a
suddint
summins
no
doubt
wired
for
started
at
onst
no
luggage
no
time
to
think
of
nothink
and
being
a
rather
porter
he
could
hardly
refrain
as
he
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
cab
door
waiting
for
the
address
from
adding
paternally
hope
you
wo
find
things
so
bad
as
you
anticerpate
miss
but
before
he
had
time
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
he
should
or
should
not
express
these
kindly
feelings
he
was
startled
by
her
saying
rapidly
though
in
a
low
voice
ask
him
to
drive
quickly
please
as
quickly
as
possible
and
then
she
gave
the
address
which
rather
to
the
porter
surprise
was
in
that
part
of
london
where
no
one
but
lawyers
and
lawyers
in
their
official
capacity
solely
are
to
be
heard
of
which
circumstance
gave
the
porter
matter
for
reflection
for
fully
one
minute
and
a
half
till
the
next
train
came
in
or
went
out
and
he
relapsed
into
his
normal
condition
whether
the
cabman
drove
quickly
or
not
it
did
not
appear
so
to
the
unhappy
girl
seated
in
his
cab
it
seemed
hours
to
her
till
he
at
last
drew
up
in
a
dingy
but
respectable
locality
where
she
had
never
been
before
in
her
life
she
jumped
out
of
the
cab
hardly
replying
to
the
driver
inquiry
as
to
whether
he
was
to
wait
which
however
as
she
had
not
paid
him
he
naturally
decided
to
do
and
only
stopping
to
read
the
lists
of
names
inscribed
at
each
side
of
the
open
doorway
leading
to
the
staircase
common
to
all
the
tenants
of
the
house
she
hurried
in
and
was
lost
to
sight
in
its
solemnly
gloomy
recesses
five
minutes
later
she
was
back
again
extreme
dejection
visible
in
her
whole
bearing
to
any
one
observing
her
with
attention
even
without
the
sight
of
the
pale
agitated
face
which
her
veil
concealed
but
the
cabman
was
not
observing
her
he
was
tired
and
inclined
to
be
drowsy
in
spite
of
the
cold
weather
and
lettice
stood
still
for
a
moment
or
two
before
getting
into
the
cab
again
godfrey
away
for
a
fortnight
at
least
what
i
do
oh
what
i
do
she
said
to
herself
pressing
her
hands
together
in
agony
if
i
only
knew
where
he
was
but
at
his
chambers
they
had
refused
though
quite
civilly
to
give
her
his
address
contenting
themselves
with
assuring
her
that
any
letters
would
be
forwarded
to
him
at
once
he
may
be
abroad
he
may
be
ever
so
far
away
he
have
let
us
know
he
was
going
but
here
her
conscience
reproached
her
how
could
she
expect
him
to
have
done
anything
of
the
sort
when
she
remembered
how
they
had
last
parted
the
cold
contempt
with
which
she
had
received
his
kind
and
reasonable
remonstrances
till
at
last
stung
into
indignation
he
had
declared
that
henceforth
he
would
leave
her
to
herself
merely
interfering
with
advice
and
direction
when
he
saw
it
absolutely
necessary
to
do
so
and
that
was
now
three
or
four
months
ago
since
then
he
had
only
written
on
strictly
business
matters
about
having
taken
on
faxleham
cottage
for
six
months
longer
directions
about
auriol
schooling
and
so
on
and
these
three
or
four
months
had
been
among
the
dreariest
and
most
anxious
lettice
had
ever
known
nina
was
pale
and
drooping
arthur
letters
were
rare
and
unsatisfactory
the
autumn
had
been
an
unusually
rainy
and
depressing
season
and
they
had
absolutely
no
friends
but
for
miss
branksome
unfailing
cheerfulness
nina
and
the
younger
ones
would
indeed
have
been
to
be
pitied
though
less
than
lettice
herself
for
far
as
she
was
from
owning
herself
to
be
the
cause
of
all
this
unhappiness
her
conscience
was
not
at
rest
and
misgivings
from
time
to
time
made
themselves
felt
though
she
stifled
them
by
exaggerating
to
herself
the
soundness
of
her
motives
and
this
very
exaggeration
made
her
write
to
poor
arthur
the
letters
which
in
his
overstrained
state
had
had
so
disastrous
a
result
towards
nina
too
she
knew
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
that
she
had
not
acted
fairly
though
the
reserve
that
had
gradually
grown
up
between
them
had
prevented
her
thoroughly
understanding
her
younger
sister
for
what
for
whom
rather
was
poor
nina
pining
she
care
for
godfrey
lettice
asked
herself
feeling
that
if
nina
had
learnt
to
do
so
it
was
thanks
to
influence
and
no
other
and
as
time
went
on
and
lettice
began
to
own
to
herself
that
it
did
seem
as
if
godfrey
were
in
love
with
nina
had
it
been
so
she
reflected
he
is
far
too
resolute
to
have
been
kept
back
by
his
quarrel
with
she
almost
came
to
hope
that
on
both
sides
the
dream
had
been
the
creation
of
her
own
fancy
her
own
she
would
not
call
it
though
even
in
this
hope
she
found
small
rest
for
her
troubled
spirit
if
it
were
not
about
godfrey
that
nina
was
fretting
away
though
patiently
and
uncomplainingly
the
brightness
from
her
pretty
eyes
the
roses
from
her
young
cheeks
about
whom
and
what
was
it
and
a
certain
afternoon
last
august
and
a
certain
conversation
with
a
honest
young
gentleman
who
had
come
to
plead
his
cause
with
manly
straightforwardness
who
had
gone
away
looking
ten
years
older
though
with
courteous
and
grateful
words
to
herself
on
his
lips
rose
up
before
lettice
remembrance
with
reproachful
eyes
and
all
these
memories
as
in
the
so
often
quoted
case
of
a
drowning
person
rushed
through
lettice
mind
in
the
during
which
she
stood
there
in
her
distress
and
desolation
while
her
lips
repeated
the
same
murmur
what
shall
oh
what
i
do
every
moment
of
time
that
i
am
losing
here
may
be
of
the
most
vital
importance
once
she
turned
and
made
a
step
or
two
towards
the
door
again
in
a
resolution
to
inquire
if
mr
auriol
clerk
could
give
her
the
address
of
philip
dexter
but
from
this
she
shrank
with
the
strongest
feelings
of
her
nature
to
go
to
to
appeal
to
to
help
me
she
reflected
it
would
be
like
begging
him
on
again
for
nina
it
would
be
owning
that
it
was
all
nonsense
about
godfrey
caring
for
her
and
for
arthur
sake
too
why
should
i
publish
his
humiliation
to
any
but
those
who
know
it
and
again
she
stood
irresolute
and
altogether
wretched
and
cabby
beginning
to
wake
up
and
giving
signs
of
being
about
to
begin
wondering
what
queer
sort
of
a
fare
as
did
know
its
own
mind
he
had
got
hold
of
doubled
and
trebled
the
girl
embarrassment
i
must
go
to
some
hotel
for
the
night
i
suppose
she
said
to
herself
and
oh
the
horror
of
sitting
there
all
the
evening
doing
nothing
and
lying
there
all
night
doing
nothing
and
arthur
my
darling
brother
setting
sail
for
america
before
we
can
stop
him
or
perhaps
worse
and
worse
tossing
in
some
miserable
place
among
strangers
in
a
brain
fever
where
he
may
die
without
having
forgiven
me
nearly
driven
frantic
by
her
own
imaginings
she
looked
round
her
with
a
vague
altogether
unreasonable
appeal
for
help
or
guidance
what
i
do
she
ejaculated
for
the
twentieth
time
when
just
at
that
moment
a
carriage
drew
up
cabby
rousing
himself
to
move
on
so
as
to
make
room
for
it
for
it
was
an
unmistakable
carriage
a
small
but
thoroughly
brougham
quite
capable
of
commanding
his
respectful
deference
before
the
door
where
lettice
was
standing
and
a
gentleman
got
out
and
came
slowly
over
the
pavement
towards
the
house
the
pavement
or
the
space
between
the
houses
and
the
real
pavement
was
wide
there
it
looked
as
if
in
times
there
might
have
been
a
or
a
flowerbed
or
two
in
front
and
as
the
approached
lettice
had
time
to
see
him
clearly
she
looked
at
him
at
the
first
glance
a
wild
idea
had
struck
her
that
possibly
he
might
be
godfrey
auriol
returned
unexpectedly
with
a
sort
of
curiosity
but
gradually
a
vague
feeling
came
over
her
that
he
was
not
altogether
unknown
to
her
that
somewhere
she
had
seen
him
before
or
else
that
he
resembled
some
one
she
had
once
known
but
as
he
passed
by
she
recollected
herself
and
turned
sharply
away
what
was
it
to
her
what
or
who
this
stranger
was
what
was
she
made
of
to
be
standing
there
losing
the
precious
moments
in
idle
conjecture
and
again
the
whole
force
of
her
mind
became
concentrated
on
the
absorbing
question
what
she
to
do
she
was
turning
at
last
to
the
cab
in
a
desperate
resolution
to
go
when
a
quick
step
behind
her
made
her
look
round
to
her
surprise
there
stood
facing
her
the
gentleman
who
a
moment
before
had
passed
her
to
enter
the
house
he
raised
his
hat
and
she
looking
at
him
was
again
struck
by
his
strange
indefinite
likeness
to
he
was
slightly
above
the
middle
height
his
dark
hair
already
a
very
little
hazed
with
grey
he
looked
a
man
of
about
forty
though
in
reality
he
was
some
years
younger
his
expression
was
gentle
but
rather
piercing
there
was
great
power
moral
and
intellectual
in
his
forehead
excuse
me
for
addressing
you
he
said
but
you
seemed
to
me
to
be
at
a
loss
perhaps
you
are
inquiring
for
some
one
you
can
not
find
i
know
this
neighbourhood
well
can
i
help
you
lettice
looked
at
him
again
the
gentleman
tone
was
so
respectful
as
well
as
kind
that
the
most
timorous
of
maidens
could
scarcely
have
failed
to
feel
confidence
in
him
and
lettice
was
the
reverse
of
timorous
she
was
fearless
to
a
fault
and
her
inexperience
suggested
no
misgiving
do
you
perhaps
she
began
do
you
happen
to
know
any
one
here
in
this
house
i
am
so
disappointed
at
finding
the
friend
the
gentleman
i
came
to
see
on
urgent
business
away
from
home
and
they
even
give
me
his
address
she
added
girlishly
the
tears
welling
up
again
as
she
spoke
a
curious
look
came
into
the
kindly
eyes
that
were
regarding
her
and
the
stranger
made
a
very
slight
involuntary
movement
almost
as
if
he
were
going
to
lay
his
hand
on
her
arm
to
console
her
as
one
would
do
to
a
troubled
child
but
he
checked
himself
i
know
mr
auriol
mr
godfrey
auriol
whose
office
is
in
this
house
he
said
that
is
he
exclaimed
lettice
with
delighted
eagerness
oh
how
fortunate
that
i
should
have
met
you
if
you
could
oh
if
you
could
but
get
them
to
give
me
his
address
i
might
telegraph
to
him
it
would
save
ever
so
much
time
perhaps
i
should
tell
you
she
went
on
i
have
a
right
to
ask
for
his
address
he
is
my
our
guardian
my
name
is
morison
there
was
no
visible
change
of
expression
in
the
stranger
face
but
one
knowing
him
well
would
have
seen
a
light
in
his
eyes
that
was
not
there
before
and
his
lips
moved
though
no
sound
was
heard
thank
god
for
this
were
the
inaudible
words
i
can
easily
get
you
his
address
he
said
i
was
just
going
in
to
ask
if
they
had
any
definite
news
of
his
return
i
want
to
see
him
as
soon
as
he
comes
back
will
you
wait
here
a
moment
it
is
very
cold
he
added
looking
round
is
that
your
cab
waiting
yes
said
lettice
the
gentleman
glanced
at
the
cab
with
its
doors
and
windows
and
the
inevitable
damp
and
chilly
straw
on
the
floor
i
doubt
if
you
would
be
much
warmer
there
he
said
with
a
smile
would
you
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
get
into
my
brougham
while
i
go
upstairs
there
is
a
footstool
and
rugs
for
i
have
just
taken
my
wife
home
you
do
think
me
very
presuming
he
added
remember
i
am
a
friend
of
godfrey
there
was
something
reassuring
in
the
simple
way
in
which
he
spoke
of
mr
auriol
by
his
christian
name
even
had
lettice
wanted
reassuring
which
she
did
not
she
looked
up
again
in
the
stranger
face
and
said
with
an
abruptness
that
sometimes
characterised
her
are
you
a
doctor
he
smiled
no
i
am
not
i
am
sorry
for
it
if
it
would
have
given
you
more
confidence
in
me
though
i
hope
he
added
with
real
anxiety
that
it
is
not
to
hear
of
a
doctor
that
you
are
here
none
of
you
are
ill
is
the
urgent
business
i
trust
no
replied
lettice
surprised
at
his
way
of
speaking
he
must
have
heard
about
us
from
godfrey
she
decided
at
least
i
hope
not
she
added
as
her
terrible
picture
of
arthur
in
a
brain
fever
came
before
her
eyes
i
not
but
i
do
know
what
i
think
or
fear
you
wo
be
long
she
said
appealingly
for
by
this
time
her
new
friend
had
handed
her
into
the
snug
little
carriage
two
minutes
at
most
he
replied
and
lettice
sat
there
grateful
in
a
sort
of
childish
way
for
the
cushioned
warmth
and
comfort
though
till
then
she
had
thought
nothing
about
how
cold
she
was
gazing
before
her
in
a
vague
way
feeling
almost
as
if
she
would
fall
asleep
if
she
were
left
there
long
but
in
some
indefinite
way
undoubtedly
many
degrees
less
miserable
and
desolate
than
before
the
apparition
of
the
brougham
its
owner
was
as
good
as
his
word
two
minutes
had
barely
elapsed
before
he
was
back
again
i
have
his
present
address
he
said
but
he
is
a
long
way
off
he
is
in
scotland
and
is
not
expected
back
for
a
fortnight
he
is
away
on
professional
business
but
he
had
hoped
not
to
have
to
go
so
far
he
had
hoped
to
be
back
to
spend
christmas
with
us
down
in
the
country
now
he
continued
what
is
to
be
done
you
can
telegraph
to
him
but
i
doubt
if
it
would
be
for
him
to
come
back
and
it
is
an
place
where
he
is
you
said
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
have
you
no
one
else
no
other
friend
or
or
relative
here
his
voice
faltered
as
he
looked
anxiously
into
the
girl
face
so
pale
and
drawn
and
careworn
as
it
had
again
become
she
roused
herself
with
a
sort
of
effort
i
do
know
what
to
do
she
repeated
can
you
not
though
i
am
a
stranger
can
you
not
make
up
your
mind
we
have
been
brought
together
so
strangely
can
you
not
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
he
said
beseechingly
almost
all
this
time
he
was
standing
with
his
hand
on
the
carriage
door
if
you
would
let
me
take
you
home
to
my
wife
he
continued
you
would
see
how
kind
and
sympathising
she
is
could
you
tell
better
oh
no
thank
you
said
lettice
i
could
tell
you
just
as
well
the
trouble
is
about
my
brother
your
brother
arthur
god
forbid
he
exclaimed
is
it
anything
very
serious
i
fear
so
but
i
do
know
she
replied
shaking
her
head
and
at
the
moment
it
did
not
strike
her
so
impressed
was
she
with
the
magnitude
of
her
overwhelming
anxiety
how
curious
it
was
that
a
complete
stranger
should
be
so
affected
by
her
troubles
yet
his
naming
her
brother
by
name
caught
her
attention
you
know
about
us
i
suppose
from
mr
auriol
she
said
yes
he
replied
but
in
an
absent
way
and
still
lettice
sat
gazing
before
her
as
if
she
were
then
suddenly
raising
her
eyes
arthur
has
run
away
she
said
at
least
he
has
away
he
wrote
that
he
would
try
to
go
to
america
but
we
were
afraid
nina
and
i
we
got
his
letter
last
night
and
i
came
off
by
the
first
train
this
morning
nina
and
miss
branksome
wanted
me
to
wait
and
to
telegraph
first
so
i
came
away
without
telling
them
i
could
not
bear
waiting
we
were
afraid
that
he
might
have
fallen
ill
somewhere
he
has
not
been
well
lately
and
the
shock
of
his
disgrace
disgrace
what
disgrace
exclaimed
the
gentleman
he
has
failed
at
least
he
saw
that
he
was
going
to
fail
in
his
examination
and
he
would
not
face
the
rest
of
it
said
lettice
the
crimson
rising
to
her
face
the
stranger
could
hardly
repress
a
smile
but
why
use
such
terribly
strong
words
about
it
failing
in
his
examination
a
disgrace
you
startled
me
he
said
with
evident
and
immense
relief
took
it
so
said
lettice
a
little
nettled
and
i
i
used
to
think
i
would
feel
it
so
too
but
i
do
seem
to
mind
now
i
would
mind
nothing
if
we
could
find
him
have
you
any
trace
can
you
tell
me
all
the
particulars
yes
said
lettice
feeling
in
her
pocket
for
arthur
letter
but
the
stranger
interrupted
her
now
that
you
have
told
me
so
much
you
will
not
refuse
to
let
me
tell
you
something
make
some
explanations
to
you
you
will
let
me
send
away
your
cab
and
take
you
home
to
my
wife
i
think
i
can
promise
to
help
you
but
you
must
give
me
all
particulars
and
in
a
circumstantial
manner
that
will
take
time
but
first
lettice
it
is
not
fair
to
you
not
to
tell
you
who
i
am
i
am
not
only
godfrey
auriol
friend
i
am
do
not
be
startled
my
child
i
am
your
uncle
ingram
morison
he
turned
away
after
saying
these
words
he
would
not
look
at
her
face
half
out
of
pity
for
her
half
out
of
an
almost
childish
terror
of
the
deep
disappointment
to
himself
should
he
see
its
expression
turn
into
hard
resentment
he
walked
up
and
down
in
the
cold
for
a
moment
or
two
then
hearing
or
fancying
he
heard
a
low
call
to
his
ears
it
took
the
sound
of
the
words
he
had
so
often
longed
to
hear
uncle
ingram
he
turned
back
again
she
was
looking
out
of
the
brougham
window
the
glass
was
down
her
face
was
paler
than
one
could
almost
believe
it
possible
for
a
young
healthy
face
to
be
her
lips
were
quivering
there
was
a
look
of
suffering
and
humiliation
almost
but
there
was
no
hardness
or
resentment
lettice
he
said
gently
i
send
away
your
cab
there
was
great
tact
in
the
tone
and
manner
of
the
simple
question
lettice
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
did
not
speak
but
she
bent
her
head
in
assent
chapter
ten
relations
speak
of
me
as
i
am
nothing
extemporate
shakespeare
the
drowsy
cabman
was
aroused
from
his
slumbers
to
be
rather
to
his
surprise
paid
and
dismissed
but
paid
so
handsomely
that
he
went
off
thinking
himself
for
once
in
the
way
of
good
luck
then
mr
morison
said
a
few
words
to
his
coachman
and
getting
into
the
brougham
took
his
seat
beside
his
niece
lettice
he
said
quietly
speaking
at
once
to
relieve
her
embarrassment
i
have
told
the
coachman
to
drive
round
a
quiet
way
before
we
go
home
to
give
you
time
to
tell
me
all
you
can
every
detail
about
arthur
so
that
we
may
not
lose
an
hour
will
you
now
give
me
the
whole
particulars
calmed
by
his
quiet
almost
manner
lettice
did
so
though
the
recital
led
her
into
much
painful
to
relate
for
now
that
thanks
to
the
terrible
anxiety
through
which
she
was
passing
the
scales
had
fallen
from
her
eyes
she
saw
in
its
true
light
even
perhaps
with
exaggerated
harshness
for
lettice
was
never
one
to
do
things
by
halves
her
own
wilful
blindness
her
own
prejudice
unreason
and
and
when
she
came
to
tell
her
uncle
how
she
had
written
to
arthur
she
altogether
broke
down
i
had
better
show
you
his
letter
she
said
amidst
her
tears
it
will
make
you
understand
him
he
exaggerated
has
he
not
she
said
looking
up
wistfully
if
he
had
not
been
overstrained
and
morbid
he
would
not
have
taken
it
up
so
would
he
she
sat
quietly
waiting
till
mr
morison
had
read
the
letter
his
face
was
very
grave
as
he
handed
it
back
to
lettice
but
it
was
grave
with
anxiety
not
with
indignation
he
was
certainly
in
a
very
excited
and
morbid
state
when
he
wrote
this
he
said
he
has
been
overworking
himself
probably
no
one
in
possession
of
their
senses
would
do
anything
but
laugh
at
his
imagining
himself
disgraced
for
life
by
having
failed
in
his
first
attempt
at
passing
for
woolwich
and
mr
morison
could
not
help
smiling
i
am
afraid
i
helped
him
to
think
so
said
lettice
you
see
he
refers
to
what
i
wrote
i
could
not
understand
his
seeming
so
much
less
in
earnest
than
he
used
to
be
and
so
spiritless
and
i
wrote
meaning
to
rouse
him
i
did
know
that
is
my
only
excuse
indeed
i
did
know
till
now
what
explains
it
all
the
dislike
he
had
taken
to
his
intended
profession
she
added
earnestly
my
dear
child
said
her
uncle
kindly
patting
the
hand
she
had
involuntarily
laid
on
his
arm
do
not
plead
so
piteously
as
if
i
were
constituting
myself
a
judge
over
you
what
you
say
seems
to
me
to
have
been
the
principal
point
the
only
point
on
which
arthur
is
really
to
blame
why
did
he
not
tell
you
that
he
no
longer
felt
any
liking
for
the
service
ah
said
lettice
i
fear
that
was
my
influence
again
i
think
he
was
afraid
of
telling
it
afraid
of
how
i
should
take
it
but
that
was
cowardice
cowardice
for
he
felt
that
lettice
winced
at
the
strong
expression
i
am
very
lettice
he
added
though
looking
at
her
so
kindly
that
the
words
had
no
harshness
in
them
when
i
see
arthur
i
shall
try
to
make
him
understand
where
he
was
wrong
and
i
think
he
will
agree
with
me
but
he
has
got
false
notions
on
other
points
i
see
what
is
all
this
about
independence
repaying
what
he
would
never
have
used
had
he
understood
the
whole
working
in
the
hopes
of
some
day
doing
so
etcetera
it
was
what
godfrey
told
us
said
lettice
in
a
low
voice
about
about
all
you
had
done
and
risked
to
save
our
money
for
the
first
time
mr
morison
face
darkened
and
lettice
realised
that
though
gentle
he
could
also
make
his
anger
felt
auriol
he
exclaimed
how
could
he
have
so
represented
or
misrepresented
things
there
was
no
need
for
anything
to
be
said
about
it
i
very
reluctantly
gave
him
leave
to
tell
you
or
your
mother
rather
that
i
had
done
what
i
could
at
a
critical
time
but
it
was
to
show
her
how
ready
how
i
was
to
be
of
use
but
as
to
its
calling
forth
any
other
feeling
gratitude
at
least
said
lettice
timidly
no
not
gratitude
even
it
was
nothing
but
natural
purely
and
thoroughly
natural
and
to
think
of
auriol
having
stated
it
so
as
to
give
you
any
painful
sense
of
obligation
how
can
he
have
done
so
lettice
hesitated
her
cup
of
was
to
be
drunk
to
the
dregs
it
seemed
she
turned
round
with
a
look
of
determination
on
her
face
uncle
ingram
she
began
and
in
the
pleasure
of
hearing
himself
so
addressed
by
her
mr
morison
face
relaxed
i
will
try
to
explain
all
i
will
not
spare
myself
it
was
not
mr
auriol
fault
he
did
tell
it
us
just
as
you
would
have
wished
he
wanted
to
soften
me
to
make
me
reasonable
but
i
repelled
him
i
made
him
angry
i
lost
my
temper
and
made
him
a
little
i
think
lose
his
too
and
lettice
was
too
absorbed
by
her
own
recital
to
see
what
perhaps
it
was
as
well
she
did
not
observe
a
slight
smile
of
amusement
which
here
crossed
her
uncle
face
and
then
he
said
what
was
true
that
we
owed
you
gratitude
we
could
never
repay
it
true
uncle
ingram
and
i
do
mind
it
but
do
you
see
that
while
we
i
was
resisting
you
refusing
to
count
you
our
uncle
it
a
painful
obligation
and
if
fate
or
something
better
than
fate
said
mr
morison
had
not
brought
us
together
it
would
would
it
lettice
have
remained
so
i
do
know
said
lettice
in
a
low
voice
i
ca
think
so
but
but
what
i
had
no
idea
you
would
be
like
what
you
are
i
could
not
have
imagined
any
one
being
so
generous
mr
morison
turned
his
face
away
for
a
moment
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
with
a
little
effort
lettice
he
said
i
am
always
considered
a
very
practical
and
prosaic
person
even
my
wife
thinks
i
was
born
with
very
little
romance
in
me
but
do
you
know
i
have
had
one
romance
one
dream
in
my
life
and
that
has
been
to
do
something
to
make
up
to
my
brother
children
for
my
having
been
put
in
his
place
here
lettice
seemed
as
if
she
was
going
to
speak
but
he
made
a
little
sign
for
her
to
wait
i
know
you
are
going
to
say
it
was
not
my
fault
but
i
want
you
to
understand
the
the
sentiment
i
have
always
associated
with
it
i
hardly
remember
my
brother
that
is
to
say
in
reality
i
scarcely
knew
him
but
the
few
times
i
saw
him
as
a
child
made
the
most
vivid
impression
on
me
he
was
to
me
a
perfect
hero
of
romance
his
appearance
his
bright
manly
beauty
his
charm
of
manners
all
left
a
picture
on
my
mind
that
i
shall
never
forget
and
the
bitterest
tears
i
ever
shed
as
a
boy
were
when
after
glorying
in
the
honours
he
had
won
and
dreaming
of
his
return
to
us
i
was
told
one
day
by
my
father
that
i
was
never
to
mention
his
name
again
i
resented
it
bitterly
i
thought
my
father
cruel
and
unjust
and
later
i
told
him
so
not
once
but
often
first
with
a
boy
impetuosity
afterwards
as
a
man
more
deliberately
though
more
respectfully
but
it
was
no
use
it
was
the
only
disagreement
we
ever
had
my
poor
father
and
i
only
as
you
know
on
his
deathbed
he
left
his
blessing
for
your
father
and
it
was
to
me
he
confided
it
but
he
went
on
in
a
different
tone
we
must
come
back
to
the
present
about
arthur
i
will
be
quite
frank
with
you
my
great
fear
is
that
he
may
have
fallen
ill
from
the
reaction
from
the
overstrained
state
he
has
evidently
been
in
i
think
the
first
thing
to
do
is
for
me
to
see
his
tutor
it
is
only
an
hour
from
town
i
know
the
place
i
will
go
down
there
at
once
may
i
go
with
you
said
lettice
eagerly
i
see
no
use
in
your
doing
so
replied
her
uncle
he
is
not
that
is
about
all
we
are
sure
of
i
can
not
understand
mr
downe
not
having
written
or
telegraphed
to
you
already
he
would
not
send
to
said
lettice
he
would
naturally
send
to
mr
auriol
and
he
you
know
is
away
to
be
sure
said
mr
morison
that
must
be
it
well
any
way
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
see
mr
downe
and
get
all
additional
particulars
from
him
and
in
the
meantime
you
must
keep
up
your
spirits
and
rest
yourself
your
aunt
will
do
her
best
to
cheer
you
my
aunt
repeated
lettice
yes
of
course
your
aunt
gertrude
my
wife
he
said
with
a
smile
i
have
never
had
an
aunt
before
said
lettice
apologetically
well
you
will
have
one
now
worthy
of
the
name
though
i
praise
my
own
belongings
he
said
brightly
in
another
minute
or
two
the
carriage
stopped
before
the
door
of
a
handsome
house
mr
morison
turned
to
lettice
will
you
wait
here
while
i
go
in
to
explain
to
your
aunt
he
said
and
lettice
her
heart
beating
more
quickly
than
usual
at
the
thought
of
this
unknown
relation
gladly
consented
the
explanation
must
have
been
quickly
made
before
lettice
could
have
thought
it
possible
her
uncle
was
back
again
there
was
an
orange
coloured
envelope
in
his
hand
this
is
from
auriol
he
said
taking
out
its
pink
paper
enclosure
which
was
as
follows
bad
news
of
arthur
impossible
to
get
away
beg
you
to
see
downe
at
once
and
decide
what
to
do
so
you
see
continued
mr
morison
my
credentials
are
now
complete
are
they
not
come
in
my
dear
child
there
is
gertrude
at
the
door
she
is
so
eager
to
see
you
lettice
had
no
time
to
feel
embarrassed
before
she
felt
herself
warmly
kissed
by
the
lady
in
mourning
who
was
waiting
to
receive
her
in
the
hall
my
dear
lettice
she
said
simply
but
with
a
ring
of
true
cordiality
i
am
happy
to
see
you
how
cold
you
must
be
tea
is
waiting
ingram
as
she
led
her
newly
found
niece
into
the
pretty
you
have
time
for
a
cup
of
tea
before
you
go
hardly
he
said
i
would
rather
not
risk
it
now
lettice
is
in
good
hands
i
would
rather
be
off
at
once
if
i
am
not
back
by
eight
or
nine
do
expect
me
but
in
that
case
i
shall
telegraph
uncle
ingram
said
lettice
as
he
was
hurrying
off
will
you
do
one
thing
more
will
you
telegraph
to
poor
nina
that
that
i
am
all
right
and
with
you
and
that
you
are
doing
all
possible
about
arthur
certainly
i
will
i
know
the
address
he
added
smiling
and
lettice
will
you
do
one
thing
for
me
of
course
what
is
it
she
said
eagerly
she
was
standing
close
beside
him
at
the
moment
give
me
a
kiss
as
a
sign
of
he
hesitated
of
gratitude
to
you
for
forgiving
me
she
half
whispered
of
better
than
that
of
your
accepting
me
from
now
as
your
uncle
your
uncle
who
has
always
loved
you
as
your
dear
father
brother
who
longs
to
supply
his
place
to
you
as
well
as
he
can
uncle
ingram
said
lettice
as
she
kissed
him
you
are
like
papa
i
understand
now
what
made
me
look
at
you
so
when
i
first
caught
sight
of
you
a
pleased
expression
came
into
mr
morison
face
though
he
said
nothing
but
when
he
had
left
them
mrs
morison
turned
to
lettice
with
a
smile
you
could
not
have
said
anything
to
please
him
as
much
and
lettice
answered
simply
as
she
felt
i
am
so
glad
it
was
like
a
dream
to
her
the
finding
herself
in
the
comfortable
house
where
everything
was
in
perfect
taste
though
nothing
overdone
tended
and
caressed
by
the
pretty
aunt
of
whose
existence
almost
she
had
twelve
hours
before
been
in
ignorance
and
her
uncle
nothing
had
ever
touched
lettice
as
much
as
his
way
of
talking
of
her
father
to
think
that
he
of
all
men
should
have
cherished
such
tender
admiration
of
him
went
to
her
very
heart
and
her
cheeks
burned
with
wholesome
shame
when
she
recalled
the
way
in
which
she
had
spoken
of
him
the
absurd
as
well
as
unworthy
prejudice
in
which
she
had
indulged
no
wonder
that
godfrey
auriol
had
lost
patience
with
her
no
wonder
he
had
resolved
on
leaving
her
henceforth
to
herself
she
only
felt
now
that
she
would
be
ashamed
ever
to
look
him
in
the
face
again
but
if
that
were
all
if
her
own
humiliation
and
punishment
were
all
lettice
felt
she
could
have
borne
it
but
alas
how
much
more
was
involved
arthur
poor
arthur
of
whom
she
had
hardly
courage
to
think
and
nina
and
as
she
thought
of
nina
again
that
conversation
with
philip
dexter
returned
to
her
mind
she
had
meant
to
do
right
why
had
she
always
done
wrong
she
had
honestly
thought
that
godfrey
would
be
a
much
more
desirable
husband
for
nina
than
philip
and
she
had
acted
accordingly
forgetting
or
trying
to
ignore
that
in
such
matters
somebody
else
thinking
has
very
little
to
do
with
it
and
that
interference
save
where
urgently
called
for
on
the
part
of
parent
or
guardian
is
wholly
unjustifiable
she
had
she
confessed
to
herself
possibly
probably
even
ruined
the
happiness
of
two
lives
through
her
own
prejudice
and
and
when
she
came
to
this
part
of
her
reflections
she
sighed
so
deeply
that
her
aunt
looked
at
her
with
real
anxiety
my
dear
lettice
she
said
you
try
to
be
hopeful
your
uncle
or
a
telegram
is
sure
to
be
here
within
an
hour
do
try
dear
lettice
looked
up
dejectedly
it
is
only
that
it
is
only
arthur
i
thinking
of
aunt
gertrude
she
said
it
is
everything
i
have
done
so
many
wrong
things
i
have
made
such
dreadful
mistakes
and
i
do
see
though
i
would
do
anything
how
they
can
ever
be
put
right
again
mrs
morison
sat
down
beside
her
and
took
her
hand
in
hers
who
knows
dear
she
said
gently
after
a
while
when
your
mind
is
less
disturbed
and
you
feel
more
at
rest
perhaps
you
may
tell
me
some
of
these
troubles
and
perhaps
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
do
my
best
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
help
you
and
just
then
it
flashed
into
lettice
mind
what
in
the
confusion
and
disturbance
of
the
day
she
had
forgotten
her
aunt
gertrude
was
philip
dexter
aunt
too
and
with
this
remembrance
came
a
little
ray
of
light
and
hope
she
had
need
of
it
for
when
a
few
minutes
later
her
uncle
returned
he
had
no
very
good
news
to
give
he
had
seen
mr
downe
arthur
tutor
and
heard
all
particulars
arthur
state
of
health
had
not
seemed
satisfactory
for
some
time
he
was
nervous
and
feverishly
excitable
and
his
tutor
had
suggested
his
deferring
going
up
for
his
examination
for
six
months
but
the
young
man
would
not
hear
of
it
but
even
before
the
end
of
the
first
day
he
had
been
forced
to
give
in
having
fainted
in
his
place
among
the
candidates
mr
downe
had
sent
him
home
at
once
but
on
his
return
later
in
the
evening
had
been
much
alarmed
at
finding
him
gone
and
had
telegraphed
to
mr
auriol
that
had
in
fact
been
all
he
knew
and
till
mr
morison
visit
he
had
been
in
hopes
that
the
young
man
had
gone
to
his
own
home
he
is
of
course
very
sorry
and
anxious
continued
mr
morison
but
only
for
fear
of
arthur
having
fallen
as
for
his
doing
anything
wrong
or
even
reckless
he
is
sure
we
need
not
be
uneasy
he
speaks
of
him
in
the
very
highest
terms
and
he
says
too
that
he
has
plenty
of
good
sense
but
he
had
begun
to
guess
the
truth
that
arthur
had
no
liking
or
inclination
for
a
military
life
and
that
hard
as
he
has
been
working
it
has
been
altogether
against
the
grain
here
a
deep
sigh
from
lettice
interrupted
him
and
what
is
to
be
done
asked
mrs
morison
we
have
already
set
on
foot
in
a
quiet
way
fill
the
inquiries
possible
but
mr
downe
and
i
agree
with
him
is
much
against
employing
detectives
or
anything
of
that
sort
oh
yes
said
lettice
arthur
would
get
over
it
besides
said
mr
morison
he
promises
in
his
letter
to
lettice
to
write
again
in
a
day
or
two
i
think
we
must
wait
for
another
letter
before
resorting
to
extreme
measures
unless
of
course
no
letter
comes
downe
does
not
much
believe
in
the
america
idea
he
thinks
arthur
will
cool
down
before
that
but
we
have
taken
measures
that
he
need
never
know
of
to
prevent
his
leaving
liverpool
for
america
that
necessary
and
now
my
child
you
must
go
to
bed
and
try
to
sleep
i
have
to
ask
your
advice
on
a
number
of
things
advice
said
lettice
humbly
uncle
you
are
too
good
to
me
chapter
eleven
slight
withal
may
be
the
things
which
bring
back
on
the
heart
the
weight
which
it
would
fling
aside
for
ever
it
may
be
a
sound
a
tone
of
music
summer
eve
or
spring
a
flower
the
wind
the
ocean
byron
and
so
things
went
on
for
a
day
or
two
as
regards
arthur
that
is
to
say
as
regarded
the
anxious
little
party
at
faxleham
cottage
mr
morison
took
immediate
steps
he
went
down
there
the
following
day
to
give
them
news
of
lettice
and
to
arrange
for
their
all
coming
to
spend
christmas
with
him
and
his
wife
lettice
would
gladly
have
accompanied
him
but
the
morning
had
found
her
completely
knocked
up
and
in
her
now
thoroughly
awakened
fear
of
her
own
she
gave
in
without
a
murmur
to
her
uncle
and
aunt
decision
that
she
must
stay
where
she
was
nor
was
she
the
only
one
to
exercise
mr
and
mrs
morison
quite
against
their
custom
determined
to
stay
in
london
for
christmas
so
that
they
should
be
nearer
at
hand
for
any
news
of
arthur
or
to
take
further
steps
should
such
be
necessary
lettice
was
overwhelmed
with
gratitude
she
was
satisfied
too
that
all
that
could
be
done
was
being
done
she
was
gentle
to
a
fault
but
her
punishment
was
of
the
severest
if
they
if
you
reproached
me
she
said
to
nina
weeping
in
her
arms
the
evening
of
their
arrival
i
could
i
think
better
bear
it
but
to
have
nothing
but
kindness
nothing
but
constant
proofs
of
affection
that
i
do
deserve
oh
nina
it
humiliates
me
but
it
not
said
nina
for
one
thing
lettice
do
you
not
owe
it
to
our
uncle
and
aunt
to
try
to
seem
a
little
less
wretched
is
it
not
selfish
to
think
of
nothing
but
our
anxiety
are
you
not
in
danger
perhaps
of
exaggerating
things
now
the
other
way
blaming
yourself
much
and
making
those
about
you
unhappy
from
your
very
sorrow
for
having
done
so
in
the
past
a
very
short
time
ago
nina
would
not
have
dared
to
speak
thus
to
her
sister
and
even
now
she
felt
that
lettice
shrank
back
a
little
from
her
as
she
listened
it
may
be
so
she
said
wearily
and
with
a
shade
of
bitterness
in
her
tone
no
doubt
i
am
bad
and
wrong
every
way
i
ca
think
what
god
lets
me
live
for
oh
lettice
said
nina
with
deep
reproach
and
the
fit
of
petulance
was
over
in
a
moment
i
know
i
should
speak
so
forgive
me
again
nina
i
will
try
and
you
know
we
have
some
reason
for
cheerfulness
think
how
glad
we
should
be
of
that
other
letter
of
arthur
showing
at
least
that
he
is
well
and
certainly
not
off
to
america
as
yet
for
the
second
letter
which
has
been
referred
to
had
been
received
from
arthur
it
told
them
of
his
but
gave
no
trace
of
his
whereabouts
the
faithful
dawson
through
ways
and
means
best
known
to
himself
managing
to
post
each
letter
sent
him
to
forward
in
a
different
part
of
london
so
that
for
the
moment
beyond
putting
advertisements
in
some
of
the
leading
papers
there
seemed
nothing
else
to
do
for
arthur
sake
when
he
return
his
uncle
was
determined
to
avoid
all
possible
hue
and
cry
and
so
long
as
they
knew
that
he
was
safe
and
well
his
sisters
thoroughly
joined
in
this
feeling
still
it
was
weary
work
waiting
i
feel
sure
we
shall
have
another
letter
this
week
continued
nina
he
is
certain
to
write
to
us
at
or
about
christmas
yes
i
think
he
will
agreed
lettice
i
have
no
doubt
he
will
keep
on
writing
regularly
but
what
good
does
that
do
it
relieves
so
far
our
anxiety
but
so
long
as
we
can
not
communicate
with
him
what
hope
have
we
of
his
returning
how
can
we
make
him
understand
how
we
long
for
him
that
he
would
be
in
no
way
reproached
and
would
be
as
free
as
air
to
choose
the
future
he
best
likes
i
do
know
how
it
will
come
said
nina
but
i
feel
sure
some
way
will
offer
itself
for
one
thing
i
think
after
a
while
he
will
long
for
news
of
us
and
will
propose
some
way
for
us
to
write
to
him
uncle
ingram
has
written
it
all
to
aunt
gertrude
brother
mr
winthrop
he
lives
somewhere
in
the
north
not
so
very
far
from
liverpool
and
uncle
ingram
is
sure
he
would
go
there
if
we
like
and
look
about
where
the
docks
are
you
know
arthur
may
be
in
liverpool
and
may
sometimes
go
about
them
if
he
has
any
idea
of
america
still
but
he
mr
winthrop
he
does
not
even
know
arthur
by
sight
objected
lettice
no
but
aunt
gertrude
has
an
idea
she
was
speaking
of
it
this
evening
philip
dexter
is
at
the
winthrops
for
christmas
aunt
gertrude
was
saying
if
went
with
mr
winthrop
it
was
a
good
idea
though
very
distasteful
to
lettice
she
would
have
done
anything
to
prevent
philip
hearing
of
their
trouble
about
arthur
for
she
had
a
fear
that
he
would
in
some
way
blame
her
for
it
but
she
checked
herself
i
must
bear
what
i
have
brought
on
myself
she
reflected
i
would
give
anything
never
to
see
philip
again
for
he
can
never
either
like
or
respect
me
he
will
not
believe
i
even
meant
to
speak
the
truth
but
if
he
cares
for
nina
and
she
for
him
i
have
less
right
than
ever
to
interfere
there
is
only
one
comfort
godfrey
auriol
never
can
know
anything
about
and
i
certainly
not
bound
to
confess
to
indeed
it
would
be
indelicate
to
nina
to
do
so
it
was
a
relief
to
her
that
he
was
still
in
scotland
and
not
to
be
back
for
christmas
her
pride
rose
rampant
at
the
thought
of
seeing
him
again
and
at
the
triumph
over
her
which
she
imagined
he
would
feel
but
she
comforted
herself
somewhat
with
the
reflection
that
for
the
future
she
need
see
very
little
of
him
much
less
than
heretofore
as
her
uncle
now
really
in
his
right
position
as
their
guardian
would
be
the
one
they
would
naturally
consult
and
thus
they
spent
christmas
day
some
among
them
so
thankful
for
the
unexpected
lifting
of
the
clouds
that
they
could
not
but
be
hopeful
for
the
future
poor
lettice
though
grateful
and
humble
yet
feeling
that
it
was
the
saddest
christmas
she
had
ever
spent
though
christmas
eve
had
brought
some
unexpected
news
which
seemed
to
throw
a
little
light
on
the
matter
of
which
all
their
hearts
were
full
this
was
a
letter
from
mr
winthrop
in
answer
to
the
one
telling
him
of
arthur
morison
disappearance
and
asking
his
advice
or
help
if
he
saw
any
way
of
giving
either
he
had
at
once
caught
up
the
idea
that
the
gentleman
tramp
and
arthur
were
one
and
the
same
and
wrote
giving
all
details
of
the
two
or
three
days
during
which
he
took
refuge
at
the
rectory
of
his
personal
appearance
what
he
had
said
and
refused
to
say
and
everything
there
was
to
tell
when
philip
comes
we
expect
him
he
wrote
i
will
get
him
to
go
with
me
to
liverpool
there
i
shall
at
once
see
simcox
for
whom
i
gave
arthur
if
it
was
he
a
letter
and
i
have
very
little
doubt
but
that
we
shall
there
hear
of
him
he
was
so
ignorant
of
my
being
in
any
way
connected
with
his
family
that
he
will
have
had
no
fear
as
to
availing
himself
of
my
introduction
for
the
good
rector
had
no
knowledge
of
the
conversation
between
the
boys
and
arthur
when
they
accompanied
him
a
bit
of
the
way
on
his
road
and
tom
and
ralph
were
far
too
careless
and
unobservant
to
have
noticed
the
start
with
which
the
young
man
had
heard
them
speak
of
their
uncle
ingram
or
the
questions
he
had
put
to
them
and
arthur
himself
for
whom
so
many
hearts
were
aching
and
anxious
how
did
he
spend
this
strange
christmas
far
from
all
he
cared
for
in
such
an
entirely
different
atmosphere
from
any
he
had
ever
known
nothing
could
have
been
kinder
considering
the
circumstances
in
which
he
had
come
among
them
than
the
way
he
was
received
and
treated
by
the
old
farmer
family
till
christmas
was
over
he
was
to
be
a
guest
and
nothing
more
there
a
time
for
all
things
said
james
who
was
jovially
inclined
rather
too
much
so
sometimes
for
his
eliza
tastes
let
business
lay
by
till
christmas
is
over
any
way
and
then
we
see
about
it
and
he
was
profoundly
distressed
that
no
persuasions
would
make
john
drink
a
glass
of
wine
or
even
taste
the
bowl
of
punch
with
which
they
wound
up
though
in
no
unseemly
fashion
the
yearly
festivities
while
eliza
on
the
other
hand
was
inclined
to
look
upon
it
as
a
sign
of
his
gentility
the
christmas
dinner
was
a
dinner
and
no
mistake
it
began
as
soon
as
they
had
all
got
home
from
church
in
the
morning
for
james
was
a
churchwarden
and
would
have
been
greatly
scandalised
had
any
one
of
the
family
played
truant
so
eliza
and
her
mother
had
to
smother
their
anxieties
as
to
the
goose
and
the
roast
beef
the
and
in
their
housewifely
bosoms
and
their
was
rewarded
by
finding
all
had
prospered
under
the
care
of
the
little
in
their
absence
on
christmas
evening
when
all
the
good
cheer
had
been
done
justice
to
and
the
draper
and
his
family
with
a
few
friends
who
had
come
in
to
taste
the
punch
were
comfortably
ensconced
round
the
fire
arthur
managed
to
steal
up
to
his
room
to
sit
there
quietly
for
a
few
thought
it
was
a
small
room
with
a
sloping
roof
and
a
dormer
window
through
which
he
could
see
the
twinkling
lights
of
the
little
town
below
and
the
purer
radiance
of
the
innumerable
stars
above
for
it
was
a
most
beautiful
winter
night
not
a
cloud
obscured
the
sky
but
it
was
bitterly
cold
arthur
got
down
his
from
the
peg
where
it
was
hanging
and
wrapped
it
round
him
for
he
felt
still
colder
from
the
contrast
with
the
warmth
of
the
room
downstairs
and
then
he
sat
gazing
out
of
the
little
window
feeling
as
absolutely
cut
off
from
all
he
had
known
and
cared
for
as
if
the
sea
already
rolled
between
them
some
of
the
excitement
which
had
led
to
the
step
he
had
taken
had
worn
off
he
no
longer
felt
quite
so
sure
that
it
had
been
the
best
and
most
unselfish
thing
to
do
and
there
were
times
even
when
he
began
to
fancy
that
perhaps
he
as
well
as
lettice
had
exaggerated
the
consequences
of
his
failure
but
with
this
reflection
in
his
calmer
state
of
mind
came
another
was
not
the
present
state
of
things
had
not
all
his
troubles
been
brought
about
by
his
want
of
moral
courage
it
was
all
very
well
to
call
it
his
consideration
for
lettice
feelings
he
was
far
too
not
to
know
that
consideration
of
that
kind
carried
too
far
becomes
insincerity
and
foolish
wrong
he
knew
too
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
that
for
all
the
stress
lettice
had
laid
on
his
dead
father
and
mother
wishes
they
would
have
been
the
last
to
have
urged
upon
him
a
profession
which
he
had
no
taste
for
they
might
have
been
he
said
to
himself
but
i
think
that
they
would
have
been
angry
not
at
least
if
i
had
been
frank
with
them
and
words
of
his
father
which
he
had
been
too
young
at
the
time
fully
to
understand
came
back
to
his
mind
do
be
in
too
great
a
hurry
my
boy
i
have
suffered
too
much
from
other
people
deciding
my
course
in
life
for
me
before
i
was
old
enough
to
know
my
own
mind
i
you
will
be
a
soldier
but
do
be
in
a
hurry
why
had
this
never
come
back
to
his
memory
before
he
remembered
it
now
so
clearly
they
were
standing
his
father
and
he
by
a
window
where
was
it
somewhere
from
whence
a
wide
expanse
of
sky
was
visible
and
it
must
have
been
at
night
yes
the
stars
were
sparkling
brightly
it
was
cold
and
clear
it
must
have
been
the
association
of
these
outward
circumstances
as
well
as
the
direction
of
his
thoughts
that
had
revived
the
remembrance
but
arthur
sighed
deeply
as
he
went
on
to
reflect
that
it
was
now
too
late
the
die
was
cast
he
must
go
on
with
what
he
had
begun
desolate
and
dreary
though
it
now
looked
to
him
the
best
he
could
hope
for
was
by
working
hard
and
faithfully
in
this
situation
which
had
so
unexpectedly
offered
itself
to
earn
enough
money
joined
to
what
he
had
to
take
him
to
america
where
with
a
good
recommendation
he
might
it
seemed
to
him
have
a
chance
of
something
better
but
even
then
how
many
years
must
pass
before
he
could
hope
to
do
more
than
maintain
himself
he
might
probably
would
be
a
man
before
he
could
begin
to
do
anything
towards
repaying
what
his
uncle
had
done
and
all
these
years
to
have
no
tidings
of
his
sisters
and
brother
for
he
had
recognised
that
only
by
cutting
himself
thus
adrift
could
he
go
on
with
what
he
had
begun
it
was
too
terrible
to
think
of
and
he
set
to
work
as
nina
had
foreseen
to
plan
how
he
could
manage
to
hear
of
them
without
revealing
where
he
was
i
do
want
them
to
write
to
me
for
nina
and
the
little
ones
would
be
entreating
me
to
come
back
and
i
could
not
bear
it
and
lettice
even
though
it
is
in
a
sense
her
doing
is
sure
not
to
see
it
as
i
do
would
want
me
to
try
again
to
pass
and
arthur
shivered
at
the
thought
no
i
dare
not
ask
them
to
write
to
me
what
can
i
do
how
can
i
hear
of
them
he
had
not
let
christmas
day
pass
without
writing
to
them
it
was
strange
to
think
that
in
a
day
or
two
they
would
have
his
letter
and
know
that
he
was
safe
and
well
while
he
could
hear
nothing
of
them
the
idea
began
to
haunt
him
so
that
at
last
he
got
up
took
off
his
coat
and
went
downstairs
again
to
the
chatter
and
warmth
of
the
draper
best
parlour
how
different
to
the
christmases
he
could
remember
how
different
from
last
christmas
at
esparto
how
different
to
the
christmas
evening
they
would
so
he
imagined
be
spending
at
faxleham
cottage
instead
of
the
simple
refinement
the
low
voices
of
his
sisters
here
were
eliza
and
her
friends
decked
out
in
brilliant
colours
laughing
loudly
at
the
jokes
of
their
husbands
and
brothers
and
little
able
to
understand
the
not
joining
in
the
fun
he
was
very
genteel
no
doubt
the
young
ladies
of
the
company
agreed
but
rather
they
should
say
for
a
young
man
as
had
his
way
to
make
in
the
world
and
arthur
overhearing
some
of
these
remarks
wished
that
the
fates
had
thrown
him
into
the
household
of
the
old
farmer
and
his
wife
rather
than
into
that
of
their
daughter
for
in
their
perfect
simplicity
and
unpretentiousness
there
was
nothing
to
grate
on
him
and
as
they
sat
rather
apart
from
the
rest
dutifully
admiring
all
that
was
said
and
done
though
perhaps
wishing
themselves
back
in
their
own
quiet
farmhouse
he
felt
that
when
they
went
away
the
next
day
things
would
seem
still
more
uncongenial
i
wish
i
knew
anything
about
farming
he
said
to
his
old
friend
when
he
was
sitting
quietly
by
him
i
have
asked
you
to
take
me
on
your
farm
and
i
have
been
glad
to
do
it
my
lad
said
the
old
man
whose
liking
for
the
young
stranger
had
steadily
increased
and
whose
thoughts
this
christmas
evening
were
softened
by
the
remembrance
of
the
son
whom
he
fancied
he
favoured
but
not
made
for
farming
it
takes
a
tougher
sort
than
thee
and
what
more
as
it
making
money
got
in
thy
head
do
go
for
to
fancy
as
people
make
fortunes
nowadays
by
farming
better
stick
to
james
he
a
bit
at
first
but
if
you
get
into
one
another
ways
you
find
him
a
good
master
the
next
day
the
draper
had
a
long
talk
with
his
guest
he
explained
to
him
some
part
of
the
work
and
told
him
he
would
by
degrees
teach
him
the
whole
but
first
he
said
i
must
tell
you
that
before
i
show
you
the
whole
of
my
business
or
even
as
much
of
it
as
you
should
know
which
would
take
some
time
and
give
me
a
good
deal
of
trouble
as
of
course
all
perfectly
new
to
you
i
should
like
to
have
some
sort
of
security
here
arthur
interrupted
him
i
can
get
some
money
he
said
did
mr
felshaw
mr
felshaw
was
the
old
farmer
did
he
not
tell
you
i
have
some
money
i
can
give
you
as
surety
for
my
honesty
and
his
face
got
red
as
he
said
it
no
no
james
replied
it
not
security
of
that
kind
i
mean
not
afraid
of
your
honesty
somehow
i
rather
risk
it
i
think
i
know
an
honest
face
when
i
see
one
what
i
was
going
to
say
was
that
i
like
some
security
that
you
stay
not
be
throwing
it
up
at
the
end
of
a
three
months
or
so
and
saying
as
how
you
were
tired
of
it
or
maybe
and
here
the
draper
hesitated
a
little
it
not
likely
now
is
it
that
any
of
your
fine
friends
might
be
coming
after
you
and
saying
as
you
were
to
stay
you
not
of
age
yet
by
a
long
way
i
should
say
no
said
arthur
i
not
quite
eighteen
that
three
years
off
still
then
said
james
but
continued
arthur
my
friends
are
not
likely
to
interfere
as
they
do
know
where
i
am
james
raised
his
eyebrows
are
they
likely
to
try
to
find
out
he
said
it
not
difficult
to
track
any
one
nowadays
but
you
no
father
and
mother
living
mr
felshaw
told
me
no
said
arthur
and
then
he
hesitated
my
friends
have
not
tried
to
find
me
yet
he
said
but
continued
james
before
you
engage
yourself
to
me
for
a
year
say
might
it
be
best
to
have
it
all
clear
and
straightforward
and
see
as
no
one
who
has
any
right
to
interfere
is
likely
to
do
so
could
you
write
and
ask
arthur
shook
his
head
i
do
want
to
give
them
any
trouble
about
me
he
said
i
done
nothing
wrong
but
i
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
difficulty
and
i
want
to
show
that
i
can
manage
for
myself
well
well
said
james
think
it
over
my
lad
you
can
just
go
on
for
a
while
quietly
doing
what
you
can
and
then
when
you
have
tried
it
a
bit
and
we
see
how
we
suit
each
other
if
so
be
as
you
feel
disposed
to
engage
yourself
for
a
year
i
put
you
in
the
way
of
things
you
can
employ
yourself
this
morning
in
measuring
off
these
bales
of
merino
and
alpaca
and
marking
the
lengths
of
each
i
be
in
the
front
shop
and
if
i
want
you
i
call
you
just
for
you
to
begin
to
get
used
to
it
like
thank
you
very
much
indeed
said
arthur
i
think
it
over
and
give
you
an
answer
as
soon
as
i
can
for
even
to
his
inexperience
it
was
clear
that
he
was
being
treated
with
unusual
kindness
and
consideration
he
did
not
overhear
what
james
said
to
his
wife
that
evening
you
take
my
word
for
it
he
not
be
with
us
long
he
said
not
in
his
place
and
he
never
take
to
it
he
blushed
up
scarlet
every
time
i
called
him
even
though
it
was
only
old
mother
green
wanting
grey
flannel
for
a
best
jacket
or
miss
snippers
apprentice
for
some
hooks
and
needles
if
it
had
been
any
of
the
quality
i
believe
he
have
turned
tail
altogether
you
see
his
friends
be
fetching
him
away
but
if
he
likes
to
stay
for
a
bit
he
welcome
i
like
a
lad
with
a
spirit
of
his
own
and
there
no
doubt
he
has
a
very
genteel
appearance
observed
eliza
complacently
chapter
twelve
ending
well
wondrous
it
is
to
see
in
diverse
mindes
how
diversely
love
doth
his
pageant
play
and
shows
his
power
in
variable
kindes
spenser
the
days
went
on
it
was
nearly
a
fortnight
past
the
new
year
and
nothing
of
moment
had
happened
arthur
letter
written
on
christmas
day
had
been
duly
received
but
it
any
more
than
its
predecessors
gave
no
clue
to
his
present
quarters
but
to
his
sisters
to
nina
especially
there
was
a
softer
tone
in
it
it
was
less
bitter
and
yet
less
morbid
he
wrote
of
his
intense
wish
to
see
them
of
his
that
he
had
acted
rightly
of
his
earnest
trust
that
some
day
they
would
lettice
above
all
learn
to
think
of
him
as
no
longer
one
to
be
ashamed
of
as
a
poor
miserable
failure
in
all
this
there
was
comfort
to
nina
but
not
to
lettice
i
am
sure
i
can
see
he
is
getting
into
a
healthier
state
of
mind
said
the
younger
sister
eagerly
if
we
could
but
write
to
him
and
tell
him
all
we
feel
i
am
sure
he
would
come
back
and
we
should
all
be
happy
again
but
lettice
shook
her
head
it
is
i
she
said
it
is
always
i
do
you
see
nina
it
is
i
that
he
is
afraid
of
but
for
me
i
dare
say
he
would
come
back
but
for
me
he
would
never
have
gone
away
godfrey
auriol
had
not
yet
returned
all
this
time
mr
morison
was
looking
forward
to
his
coming
back
as
to
a
sort
of
goal
he
is
so
and
alert
he
said
to
nina
for
to
lettice
he
seldom
spoke
of
his
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
mention
of
his
name
always
was
met
by
her
with
shrinking
and
reluctance
he
is
so
energetic
and
clever
and
he
knows
arthur
personally
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
when
he
returns
he
will
suggest
something
hitherto
certainly
everything
has
lamentably
failed
for
mr
winthrop
and
philip
had
been
to
liverpool
had
seen
mr
simcox
who
could
only
assure
them
that
no
one
in
the
least
answering
to
the
description
of
arthur
or
the
gentleman
tramp
had
applied
to
him
and
that
he
had
never
received
the
letter
of
introduction
they
had
inquired
so
far
as
they
dared
without
transgressing
mr
injunctions
of
privacy
in
every
part
of
the
town
but
without
any
result
there
was
even
after
all
some
amount
of
uncertainty
as
to
whether
the
young
man
who
had
been
so
kindly
received
at
the
rectory
been
arthur
morison
though
whether
he
were
or
were
not
mr
winthrop
was
equally
at
a
loss
to
explain
his
never
having
made
use
of
the
introduction
he
had
so
thankfully
received
i
wonder
philip
has
not
come
back
to
town
when
he
knows
we
are
all
here
together
said
mrs
morison
one
evening
i
never
knew
him
stay
so
long
at
the
winthrops
before
there
may
be
some
attraction
said
mr
morison
you
forget
my
dear
gertrude
that
your
niece
daisy
is
seventeen
now
and
she
bade
fair
to
be
a
very
pretty
girl
nina
was
sitting
at
the
piano
she
had
been
playing
and
had
turned
half
carelessly
on
the
stool
to
join
in
the
conversation
going
on
suddenly
she
wheeled
round
and
began
playing
again
more
loudly
and
energetically
than
was
her
wont
lettice
on
her
side
who
was
helping
her
aunt
to
pour
out
the
tea
grew
so
pale
that
mrs
morison
was
on
the
point
of
asking
her
what
was
the
matter
when
a
slight
warning
touch
of
the
girl
hand
on
her
arm
restrained
her
i
must
warn
ingram
thought
mrs
morison
some
vague
remembrance
returning
to
her
of
having
heard
or
been
told
by
some
one
of
her
nephew
philip
having
greatly
admired
one
of
her
husband
nieces
lettice
or
nina
which
was
it
oh
nina
it
must
have
been
that
time
she
was
staying
with
the
curries
near
philip
home
and
she
stole
a
glance
of
sympathy
at
the
girl
at
the
piano
who
continued
to
play
more
softly
now
and
with
an
undertone
of
sadness
in
her
touch
which
seemed
to
appeal
to
her
aunt
kind
heart
poor
little
thing
she
thought
but
if
there
anything
in
it
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
put
it
right
she
turned
to
look
for
lettice
with
some
vague
idea
of
seeking
her
confidence
on
the
subject
lettice
was
sitting
quietly
at
a
little
distance
with
a
book
open
before
her
mrs
morison
was
crossing
the
room
to
sit
down
beside
her
when
a
ring
at
the
bell
made
them
all
start
not
that
rings
at
the
bell
are
so
uncommon
an
occurrence
in
a
london
house
but
it
was
getting
late
no
visitor
was
expected
and
the
ring
had
a
decided
and
slightly
authoritative
sound
it
is
like
auriol
ring
said
mr
morison
and
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
when
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
mr
auriol
was
announced
every
one
jumped
up
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
bustle
of
surprise
and
welcome
questions
asked
and
answered
so
that
lettice
quiet
greeting
passed
among
the
rest
without
any
one
specially
remarking
it
she
was
inexpressibly
thankful
when
it
was
over
and
in
her
heart
grateful
to
godfrey
for
making
this
first
meeting
under
the
so
strangely
altered
circumstances
pass
so
easily
i
have
only
just
got
back
he
said
when
the
hubbub
had
subsided
and
mrs
morrison
had
rung
for
fresh
tea
i
came
on
here
as
soon
as
i
had
changed
my
clothes
i
have
been
travelling
all
day
that
last
place
where
i
was
at
is
so
frightfully
out
of
the
way
but
i
stayed
a
night
at
the
winthrops
he
spoke
faster
than
usual
and
it
was
not
difficult
for
any
one
used
to
him
to
detect
some
underlying
excitement
lettice
at
least
did
so
and
sympathised
in
it
as
for
the
first
time
it
struck
her
that
this
meeting
was
for
him
too
difficult
and
trying
she
said
nothing
but
when
her
aunt
exclaimed
travelling
all
dear
me
you
must
be
tired
she
murmured
gently
yes
indeed
and
godfrey
caught
her
words
faint
as
they
were
and
looked
pleased
i
was
so
anxious
to
hear
if
if
you
had
heard
anything
more
he
said
and
though
he
did
not
name
arthur
every
one
knew
that
was
what
he
meant
nothing
more
said
mr
morison
for
the
last
letter
bearing
date
now
nearly
a
fortnight
ago
had
been
communicated
to
mr
auriol
i
must
have
a
long
talk
with
you
about
it
all
auriol
i
think
it
is
about
time
to
be
doing
something
more
energetic
and
yet
we
have
all
agreed
in
feeling
very
reluctant
to
making
any
that
could
possibly
be
avoided
oh
yes
said
nina
fervently
clasping
her
hands
mr
auriol
sat
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
then
he
looked
up
and
said
you
have
no
idea
i
suppose
who
it
is
that
posts
his
letters
for
him
mr
morison
looked
a
little
bewildered
they
are
all
posted
in
london
i
think
you
told
me
added
mr
auriol
to
be
sure
said
mr
morison
yes
i
have
once
or
twice
wondered
who
does
it
unless
it
is
himself
no
he
has
distinctly
said
he
is
not
in
london
i
thought
of
it
but
not
very
much
i
fancied
it
so
hopeless
to
get
any
clue
in
that
way
but
it
must
be
some
one
in
his
confidence
some
one
i
should
almost
say
whom
he
had
a
claim
on
said
godfrey
for
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
risk
in
doing
it
the
person
might
be
blamed
for
having
taken
any
part
in
it
is
there
no
one
any
of
you
have
ever
heard
of
who
would
be
likely
to
agree
to
do
arthur
a
service
of
the
kind
he
looked
round
but
his
glance
seemed
to
rest
on
lettice
no
one
spoke
you
must
all
think
it
over
he
said
it
only
a
suggestion
but
something
may
come
of
it
and
soon
after
allowing
that
he
very
tired
he
said
good
night
and
went
away
lettice
in
the
quiet
of
her
own
room
realised
how
kindly
and
considerately
he
had
behaved
his
manner
had
been
the
greatest
relief
and
nothing
that
he
could
have
said
could
have
been
so
full
of
tact
and
delicacy
as
his
saying
nothing
i
do
believe
thought
the
girl
her
impulsive
nature
aglow
again
i
do
believe
he
hurried
out
here
as
much
for
my
sake
as
on
account
of
his
anxiety
he
knew
his
coming
in
that
sudden
way
would
carry
off
the
awkwardness
it
is
very
generous
of
him
then
her
thoughts
reverted
to
what
he
had
suggested
she
know
any
one
standing
in
such
a
position
to
arthur
she
sat
long
thinking
asking
herself
the
question
when
suddenly
by
that
curious
process
by
which
it
sometimes
seems
as
if
the
machinery
of
our
brain
obeyed
our
orders
unconsciously
to
ourselves
there
dashed
into
her
memory
a
name
a
sentence
she
had
heard
arthur
utter
the
name
was
dawson
and
as
she
repeated
it
to
herself
she
seemed
to
hear
her
brother
voice
saying
thoughtfully
yes
i
do
believe
there
one
person
in
the
world
who
do
anything
for
me
it
that
fellow
dawson
i
told
you
about
him
lettice
yes
he
had
told
her
about
him
though
he
probably
had
forgotten
doing
so
just
as
she
till
this
moment
had
forgotten
having
heard
it
now
by
slow
degrees
it
came
back
to
her
dawson
had
been
a
young
servant
in
mr
downe
service
and
by
a
fall
from
a
ladder
had
broken
his
leg
being
naturally
delicate
this
accident
had
altogether
ruined
his
health
he
was
pronounced
incurably
lame
and
arthur
had
done
his
utmost
to
help
and
comfort
the
poor
boy
i
do
not
know
that
lettice
remembered
all
these
details
so
clearly
but
they
were
the
facts
and
she
recalled
enough
to
make
her
sure
that
dawson
was
worth
looking
up
she
knew
he
been
living
at
the
little
town
near
to
which
was
mr
cramming
establishment
she
felt
almost
sure
his
home
was
there
in
any
case
it
was
more
than
probable
he
would
there
be
heard
of
and
surely
surely
it
was
worth
trying
whatever
were
lettice
morison
faults
and
failings
want
of
courage
and
determination
were
not
among
them
her
plans
were
soon
made
it
was
but
little
sleep
that
fell
to
her
share
that
night
i
must
go
alone
she
said
to
herself
if
i
have
discovered
secret
i
have
no
right
to
share
it
with
any
other
till
i
know
what
he
himself
wishes
besides
it
is
i
who
am
to
blame
for
his
having
been
driven
away
it
is
i
who
should
bring
him
back
she
quickly
made
her
arrangements
for
the
second
time
in
the
course
of
but
a
few
weeks
she
wrote
a
note
for
nina
to
find
after
she
should
have
left
a
note
to
some
extent
explaining
what
she
was
about
i
think
i
have
got
a
clue
dearest
nina
she
said
but
i
must
follow
it
up
alone
do
not
be
the
least
uneasy
about
me
i
shall
probably
be
back
in
a
few
hours
if
not
i
will
telegraph
in
the
course
of
the
day
this
was
about
all
that
nina
had
to
show
to
her
uncle
when
at
that
morning
she
rushed
downstairs
with
the
tidings
of
lettice
disappearance
mr
morison
looked
and
was
terribly
put
out
for
the
first
time
his
patience
seemed
about
to
desert
him
it
is
really
too
bad
he
said
what
have
i
done
or
left
undone
that
lettice
should
meet
me
with
so
little
confidence
it
is
all
nonsense
about
her
being
the
only
person
who
could
act
if
indeed
there
is
anything
to
act
about
it
is
too
bad
and
then
catching
sight
of
the
excessive
distress
in
nina
gentle
face
his
kind
heart
smote
him
for
adding
to
it
after
all
he
said
more
cheerfully
than
he
felt
i
do
not
know
that
there
is
anything
to
be
really
uneasy
about
i
quite
expect
her
back
by
luncheon
we
let
her
off
too
easily
the
last
time
eh
nina
poor
child
what
a
child
she
is
to
do
things
in
this
silly
way
they
went
in
to
breakfast
and
nina
tried
to
follow
her
uncle
example
and
to
believe
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
seriously
alarmed
about
but
neither
mr
nor
mrs
morison
eat
anything
and
seemed
eager
to
leave
the
table
in
order
no
doubt
to
discuss
what
steps
to
take
dear
me
thought
poor
nina
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
trouble
from
first
to
last
we
have
caused
them
just
as
the
mockery
of
a
breakfast
was
over
miss
branksome
and
the
younger
children
had
had
theirs
earlier
and
the
three
were
rising
from
the
table
there
came
as
the
evening
before
a
short
sharp
authoritative
ring
at
the
that
sounds
like
auriol
again
said
mr
morison
smiling
at
his
own
fancifulness
though
of
course
it
ca
be
at
this
time
of
the
morning
but
he
was
mistaken
it
mr
auriol
in
he
hurried
not
waiting
for
the
footman
to
announce
him
a
bright
eager
expression
on
his
face
an
opened
envelope
in
his
hand
good
news
he
cried
i
have
a
letter
from
arthur
giving
an
address
to
which
i
may
write
if
i
have
good
news
for
i
could
not
rest
till
i
told
you
of
it
so
i
rushed
up
here
at
once
will
you
give
me
a
cup
of
tea
mrs
morison
the
letter
was
to
be
private
i
could
guarantee
of
you
feeling
as
i
know
you
do
about
it
lettice
especially
it
all
hangs
on
her
but
i
know
she
will
be
only
too
ready
where
is
she
not
down
yet
the
three
others
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
forgetting
their
own
trouble
in
honest
reluctance
to
chill
poor
godfrey
evident
delight
nina
was
the
first
to
speak
oh
she
said
and
the
exclamation
came
from
the
very
bottom
of
her
heart
if
lettice
had
but
waited
till
he
looked
up
in
bewildered
amazement
then
all
had
to
be
told
and
lettice
letter
shown
godfrey
bit
his
lips
till
it
made
nina
nervous
to
watch
him
as
he
read
it
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
is
it
my
fault
again
have
i
frightened
her
away
he
said
almost
piteously
at
which
of
course
they
all
exclaimed
though
he
seemed
hardly
convinced
by
what
they
said
then
he
told
them
about
arthur
letter
it
had
been
drawn
forth
by
the
terrible
which
had
began
to
prey
upon
him
and
by
the
necessity
of
his
coming
to
a
decision
about
binding
himself
to
his
present
employer
for
a
considerable
time
he
gave
no
particulars
as
to
where
he
was
or
how
employed
but
spoke
of
his
misery
at
being
without
any
tidings
of
all
at
home
and
how
at
last
the
idea
had
come
to
him
of
confiding
in
godfrey
i
trust
you
implicitly
even
though
you
are
my
guardian
he
said
naively
not
to
speak
of
this
letter
not
to
endeavour
to
find
me
unless
you
are
assured
that
they
all
want
me
to
come
back
that
they
will
not
be
lettice
especially
ashamed
of
me
that
lettice
will
not
insist
on
my
trying
again
when
i
know
i
should
again
fail
all
depends
on
lettice
then
he
gave
the
address
to
which
mr
auriol
was
to
write
but
entreated
him
not
to
let
the
person
living
at
that
address
be
blamed
or
fall
into
any
trouble
on
his
account
he
has
been
a
faithful
friend
arthur
wrote
but
for
him
i
could
not
have
written
home
at
all
who
is
it
asked
mr
morison
i
have
no
idea
said
godfrey
i
saw
no
necessity
for
inquiring
i
meant
just
to
write
and
to
ask
his
sisters
to
do
so
he
went
on
i
felt
sure
they
miss
morison
especially
would
know
how
to
write
so
as
to
bring
him
back
at
once
but
now
there
is
no
use
writing
till
we
know
where
she
is
and
what
she
is
doing
and
yet
he
glanced
at
the
envelope
he
will
be
already
wondering
at
my
silence
this
letter
has
been
following
me
about
for
more
than
a
week
mr
auriol
said
nina
suddenly
do
you
remember
what
you
asked
us
last
night
to
try
to
think
of
any
one
whom
arthur
may
have
employed
to
post
his
letters
that
may
have
put
something
in
lettice
head
she
may
have
thought
of
some
one
i
have
a
vague
idea
of
some
young
man
some
boy
living
near
mr
downe
whom
arthur
was
kind
to
this
may
be
he
said
mr
auriol
the
letter
is
to
be
sent
under
cover
to
dawson
in
a
village
near
fretcham
where
mr
is
i
believe
that
is
where
she
has
gone
she
must
have
remembered
it
said
mr
morison
what
shall
we
do
i
shall
start
at
once
said
godfrey
dawson
whoever
he
is
will
not
be
so
startled
by
me
as
by
any
one
else
as
he
has
sent
on
this
letter
to
me
and
of
course
there
will
be
no
treachery
to
arthur
in
his
telling
me
if
miss
morison
has
been
there
perhaps
it
is
the
best
thing
to
do
said
mr
morison
though
i
would
gladly
have
gone
myself
and
i
do
hope
you
will
bring
lettice
back
with
you
said
nina
and
almost
before
they
had
realised
his
apparition
among
them
he
was
gone
another
long
miserable
day
of
waiting
for
telegrams
said
poor
nina
piteously
and
then
determining
to
follow
sensible
miss
advice
she
went
in
search
of
her
to
beg
her
to
suggest
some
employment
to
make
the
time
of
suspense
pass
more
quickly
give
me
some
piece
of
hard
work
please
a
very
difficult
german
translation
might
do
or
a
piece
of
very
fine
old
lace
to
mend
and
poor
miss
branksome
was
cudgelling
her
brains
as
to
what
to
propose
when
mrs
morison
voice
calling
nina
interrupted
them
nina
i
want
you
said
her
aunt
will
you
help
me
to
write
some
notes
and
to
attend
to
several
little
things
i
want
done
quickly
for
i
have
just
had
a
word
from
philip
dexter
he
has
come
back
and
is
to
be
here
at
luncheon
and
i
should
not
like
to
be
busy
the
first
time
he
comes
after
so
long
thus
occupation
was
found
both
for
nina
fingers
and
thoughts
late
very
late
that
evening
a
lady
in
mourning
got
out
of
the
train
at
a
junction
far
away
in
the
north
this
is
merton
junction
is
it
not
she
said
timidly
it
is
here
that
one
changes
for
greenwell
is
it
not
greenwell
said
the
porter
questioningly
that
is
on
the
other
side
of
middleham
is
it
not
for
greenwell
was
a
very
little
town
i
do
know
said
lettice
for
lettice
of
course
it
was
i
thought
everybody
would
know
it
here
they
told
me
in
london
to
take
my
ticket
to
merton
and
then
get
another
the
porter
looked
confused
and
rather
bothered
he
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
station
for
the
night
there
were
no
more
trains
for
an
hour
or
two
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
this
unfortunate
traveller
and
yet
not
being
of
a
surly
nature
did
not
like
to
throw
her
off
it
ended
in
the
poor
man
giving
himself
a
good
deal
of
trouble
to
find
out
that
there
was
no
train
for
greenwell
till
four
in
the
morning
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
for
lettice
to
spend
the
night
in
the
desolate
of
the
station
for
the
junction
was
some
distance
from
the
small
town
of
the
name
even
had
she
felt
able
to
walk
there
lettice
could
hardly
have
had
a
couple
of
hours
sleep
before
she
would
have
had
to
come
back
again
it
was
not
a
cheerful
prospect
four
or
five
hours
at
a
railway
station
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
january
the
porter
poked
up
the
fire
and
told
her
she
no
need
to
be
afeard
he
would
speak
to
the
there
be
a
couple
of
them
there
and
at
four
there
be
some
one
to
give
her
her
ticket
and
with
a
friendly
good
night
none
the
less
so
for
the
fee
which
lettice
gave
him
he
went
off
she
a
little
frightened
in
vain
she
told
herself
she
had
no
need
to
be
so
all
the
horrible
stories
she
had
ever
heard
of
in
such
circumstances
returned
to
her
mind
she
tried
to
sleep
on
the
hard
horsehair
sofa
and
succeeded
in
dozing
uncomfortably
to
be
startled
awake
by
one
of
the
coming
in
to
stir
up
the
fire
then
she
dozed
again
to
wake
shivering
with
cold
the
fire
out
the
faint
gaslight
sufficing
but
to
make
darkness
visible
she
started
up
there
was
light
enough
to
see
the
time
by
her
watch
with
the
greatest
relief
she
saw
that
it
was
three
half
an
hour
later
she
had
got
her
ticket
and
was
stepping
into
a
carriage
of
the
train
which
had
come
in
from
the
south
and
was
going
on
to
middleham
now
at
last
thought
lettice
my
troubles
are
over
in
a
few
hours
more
i
shall
be
with
arthur
as
she
settled
herself
in
her
place
she
saw
by
the
feeble
that
there
were
two
other
persons
in
the
carriage
two
gentlemen
she
glanced
at
them
but
with
no
interest
curiosity
and
she
distinguished
neither
of
their
faces
one
an
elderly
man
got
out
at
the
first
station
they
stopped
at
the
little
bustle
of
handing
him
some
of
his
belongings
brought
lettice
face
to
face
with
the
remaining
passenger
both
started
both
gave
vent
to
an
exclamation
but
lettice
was
of
dismay
her
companion
of
relief
mr
auriol
lettice
miss
morison
how
thankful
i
am
to
have
found
you
lettice
face
cold
as
it
was
burned
found
me
she
repeated
have
you
been
sent
after
me
to
look
for
me
there
was
no
need
for
anything
of
the
kind
i
telegraphed
yesterday
to
say
i
was
coming
on
to
she
hesitated
not
sure
if
she
would
to
say
whither
she
was
bound
but
her
tone
was
full
of
resentment
godfrey
gave
a
sigh
that
was
half
a
groan
of
something
very
like
despair
will
you
misunderstand
me
he
said
what
can
i
say
what
can
i
do
you
seem
to
think
i
have
a
mission
in
life
of
annoying
and
insulting
you
what
can
a
man
do
to
prove
that
he
does
not
deserve
to
be
so
thought
of
lettice
looked
at
him
in
amazement
not
unmixed
with
compunction
was
this
the
calm
stately
mr
auriol
did
he
so
care
for
her
opinion
she
could
hardly
take
it
in
and
then
by
a
quick
revulsion
she
remembered
how
only
the
night
before
she
had
called
him
and
felt
that
he
deserved
to
be
called
generous
i
am
sorry
for
being
so
hasty
she
said
but
i
do
see
why
you
or
any
one
need
have
followed
me
i
wanted
she
went
on
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
wanted
to
have
done
it
all
myself
it
it
was
my
fault
arthur
went
away
i
wanted
to
be
the
one
to
bring
him
back
godfrey
moved
away
he
could
hardly
help
smiling
and
yet
he
was
so
sorry
for
her
what
a
child
she
was
what
a
mixture
of
gentleness
and
obstinacy
of
generosity
and
devotion
and
lettice
he
said
very
very
gently
but
very
seriously
nevertheless
there
are
some
things
in
which
you
yield
to
those
older
and
more
experienced
than
you
it
is
right
for
a
young
creature
like
you
so
now
you
must
not
be
angry
so
lovely
and
so
sure
to
be
remarked
to
go
running
about
the
country
however
good
your
motive
may
be
you
do
know
you
can
hardly
imagine
the
anxiety
they
we
have
all
been
in
and
he
hesitated
i
i
do
believe
the
most
of
all
said
lettice
and
the
tears
in
her
eyes
began
slowly
to
trickle
down
her
face
you
hate
me
i
know
why
should
you
mind
what
i
do
it
is
i
that
have
caused
you
all
the
trouble
i
hate
you
he
repeated
lettice
are
you
saying
that
on
purpose
yes
you
have
caused
me
more
trouble
than
any
one
else
has
ever
done
because
from
the
first
moment
i
ever
saw
you
from
that
first
evening
at
esparto
i
have
you
lettice
and
everything
has
been
against
me
i
am
mad
to
tell
you
this
i
meant
never
to
have
let
it
pass
my
lips
lettice
face
was
burning
but
not
with
anger
she
herself
could
not
have
defined
her
own
feelings
she
tried
to
speak
but
the
words
were
all
but
inaudible
you
make
me
ashamed
she
said
i
ca
understand
it
but
at
that
moment
the
train
slackened
the
faint
morning
light
was
struggling
in
the
cold
wintry
sky
mr
auriol
sprang
from
his
seat
we
get
out
here
he
said
this
is
middleham
and
submissive
at
last
lettice
allowed
him
to
help
her
out
of
the
carriage
he
took
her
at
once
to
the
best
hotel
of
the
place
and
then
having
ordered
some
breakfast
of
which
she
was
sorely
in
need
for
she
had
eaten
almost
nothing
the
day
before
he
gave
her
arthur
letter
to
read
and
explained
to
her
what
he
intended
to
do
plans
had
been
of
the
simplest
i
meant
just
to
go
to
the
address
at
greenwell
and
ask
for
him
she
said
and
she
quickly
saw
that
mr
auriol
intention
of
telegraphing
to
arthur
at
once
to
come
over
to
see
him
at
middleham
was
much
better
it
will
involve
him
in
no
awkwardness
he
said
nor
will
it
lead
to
his
blaming
dawson
poor
fellow
for
i
he
added
with
a
smile
am
armed
with
his
own
credentials
and
he
touched
the
letter
as
he
spoke
you
do
think
arthur
will
be
angry
with
dawson
said
lettice
or
she
went
on
and
the
idea
struck
mr
auriol
as
very
comical
with
i
dawson
tell
me
an
hour
later
mr
auriol
returned
to
the
where
he
had
left
lettice
with
an
open
telegram
in
his
hand
this
is
from
arthur
he
said
or
rather
from
morris
he
added
with
a
slight
smile
as
he
handed
it
to
lettice
thousand
thanks
will
be
with
you
by
twelve
was
the
telegram
i
do
think
there
is
much
fear
of
his
being
angry
with
anybody
observed
mr
auriol
thanks
to
you
it
was
so
much
better
to
send
for
him
than
to
go
there
said
lettice
impulsively
godfrey
face
flushed
he
half
turned
away
then
taking
courage
he
came
nearer
again
lettice
he
said
are
you
not
angry
with
i
forgot
myself
it
is
very
good
of
you
not
to
resent
it
resent
it
said
lettice
simply
how
i
do
so
i
ca
quite
believe
that
you
knew
what
you
were
saying
i
think
you
must
be
so
sorry
for
me
for
all
the
trouble
i
have
brought
on
myself
and
on
other
people
that
that
just
that
you
are
very
sorry
for
me
for
one
thing
and
her
voice
grew
very
low
and
her
face
very
red
i
thought
you
cared
for
nina
you
too
he
exclaimed
how
extraordinary
it
is
a
good
thing
i
do
not
not
in
that
way
for
i
should
have
had
no
chance
of
success
i
met
philip
dexter
at
the
winthrops
where
i
stayed
a
night
and
i
think
he
would
not
mind
my
telling
you
in
talking
together
rather
confidentially
i
found
out
that
he
too
has
had
that
idea
and
has
been
very
unhappy
but
i
put
it
all
right
and
he
back
in
london
by
this
time
we
may
hear
some
news
on
our
return
did
he
tell
you
what
gave
him
the
idea
asked
lettice
almost
in
a
whisper
some
chance
words
of
mine
at
esparto
said
godfrey
it
is
very
generous
of
him
to
have
said
so
but
it
was
not
only
that
said
lettice
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
but
somehow
or
other
the
confession
she
made
of
this
new
offence
did
not
lower
her
in
mr
auriol
eyes
as
hopelessly
as
she
had
expected
a
few
days
later
a
happily
reunited
family
were
assembled
in
mr
morison
house
how
easy
it
was
for
lettice
to
convince
arthur
of
the
complete
change
in
her
feelings
when
she
told
him
of
the
reconciliation
with
their
uncle
may
be
imagined
how
more
than
ready
to
forgive
her
unfortunate
influence
in
their
affairs
she
found
philip
and
nina
how
her
uncle
and
aunt
promised
to
forget
the
anxiety
she
had
caused
them
on
condition
of
her
never
again
thus
setting
aside
the
judgment
and
experience
of
her
natural
protectors
how
more
than
amazed
was
everybody
when
a
few
weeks
later
by
which
time
lettice
had
learnt
to
believe
that
godfrey
auriol
mean
what
he
said
her
engagement
to
him
was
announced
all
these
hows
i
must
also
leave
to
my
reader
imagination
the
old
farmer
and
his
family
whose
honest
kindliness
had
so
fortunately
intervened
to
save
poor
arthur
from
taking
some
really
foolish
step
were
not
forgotten
and
in
when
his
wish
was
fulfilled
and
he
had
replaced
his
uncle
at
the
head
of
his
firm
he
would
sometimes
recall
with
a
smile
the
days
when
he
had
measured
grey
flannel
and
wrapped
up
parcels
of
tapes
and
ribbons
for
the
dames
of
greenwell
there
are
many
ways
in
which
life
lessons
are
taught
some
have
to
go
through
hard
and
sorrowful
experiences
harder
it
often
seems
than
they
merit
others
like
lettice
learn
true
humility
and
sacrifice
of
by
gentler
discipline
as
she
often
said
to
herself
how
can
i
ever
be
good
enough
to
show
my
gratitude
how
little
have
i
deserved
such
happiness
i
who
might
have
ruined
not
merely
my
own
life
but
those
of
others
by
my
foolish
obstinacy
and
prejudice
was
a
word
and
a
sentiment
which
lettice
children
were
never
allowed
to
know
the
meaning
of
