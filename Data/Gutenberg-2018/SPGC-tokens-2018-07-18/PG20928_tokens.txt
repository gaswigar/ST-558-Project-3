preface
at
the
outbreak
of
the
american
war
in
common
with
many
of
my
countrymen
i
felt
very
indifferent
as
to
which
side
might
win
but
if
i
had
any
bias
my
sympathies
were
rather
in
favour
of
the
north
on
account
of
the
dislike
which
an
englishman
naturally
feels
at
the
idea
of
slavery
but
soon
a
sentiment
of
great
admiration
for
the
gallantry
and
determination
of
the
southerners
together
with
the
unhappy
contrast
afforded
by
the
foolish
bullying
conduct
of
the
northerners
caused
a
complete
revulsion
in
my
feelings
and
i
was
unable
to
repress
a
strong
wish
to
go
to
america
and
see
something
of
this
wonderful
struggle
having
successfully
accomplished
my
design
i
returned
to
england
and
found
amongst
all
my
friends
an
extreme
desire
to
know
the
truth
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
south
for
in
consequence
of
the
blockade
the
truth
can
with
difficulty
be
arrived
at
as
intelligence
coming
mainly
through
northern
sources
is
not
believed
and
in
fact
nowhere
is
the
ignorance
of
what
is
passing
in
the
south
more
profound
than
it
is
in
the
northern
states
in
consequence
of
a
desire
often
expressed
i
now
publish
the
diary
which
i
endeavoured
as
well
as
i
could
to
keep
up
day
by
day
during
my
travels
throughout
the
confederate
states
the
latter
portion
of
the
diary
which
has
reference
to
the
battle
of
gettysburg
has
already
appeared
in
magazine
and
the
interest
with
which
it
was
received
has
encouraged
me
to
publish
the
remainder
i
have
not
attempted
to
conceal
any
of
the
peculiarities
or
defects
of
the
southern
people
many
persons
will
doubtless
highly
disapprove
of
some
of
their
customs
and
habits
in
the
wilder
portion
of
the
country
but
i
think
no
generous
man
whatever
may
be
his
political
opinions
can
do
otherwise
than
admire
the
courage
energy
and
patriotism
of
the
whole
population
and
the
skill
of
its
leaders
in
this
struggle
against
great
odds
and
i
am
also
of
opinion
that
many
will
agree
with
me
in
thinking
that
a
people
in
which
all
ranks
and
both
sexes
display
a
unanimity
and
a
heroism
which
can
never
have
been
surpassed
in
the
history
of
the
world
is
destined
sooner
or
later
to
become
a
great
and
independent
nation
three
months
in
the
southern
states
april
may
june
march
i
left
england
in
the
royal
mail
steamer
atrato
and
arrived
at
st
thomas
on
the
anchored
at
havana
at
where
i
fell
in
with
my
old
friend
frigate
immortalité
captain
hancock
not
only
volunteered
to
take
me
as
his
guest
to
matamoros
but
also
to
take
a
texan
merchant
whose
acquaintance
i
had
made
in
the
atrato
this
gentleman
name
is
he
is
of
irish
birth
an
excellent
fellow
and
a
good
companion
and
when
he
understood
my
wish
to
see
the
south
he
had
most
volunteered
to
pilot
me
over
part
of
the
texan
deserts
i
owe
much
to
captain
hancock
kindness
left
havana
in
immortalité
at
knocked
off
steam
when
outside
the
harbour
anchored
at
three
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
or
rio
bravo
del
norte
which
is
i
believe
its
more
correct
name
in
the
midst
of
about
seventy
merchant
vessels
the
texan
and
i
left
the
immortalité
in
her
cutter
at
and
crossed
the
bar
in
fine
style
the
cutter
was
steered
by
mr
johnston
the
master
and
having
a
fair
wind
we
passed
in
like
a
flash
of
lightning
and
landed
at
the
miserable
village
of
bagdad
on
the
mexican
bank
of
the
rio
grande
the
bar
was
luckily
in
capital
order
feet
of
water
and
smooth
it
is
often
impassable
for
ten
or
twelve
days
together
the
depth
of
water
varying
from
to
feet
it
is
very
dangerous
from
the
heavy
surf
and
sharks
also
abound
boats
are
frequently
capsized
in
crossing
it
and
the
orlando
lost
a
man
on
it
about
a
month
ago
seventy
vessels
are
constantly
at
anchor
outside
the
bar
their
cotton
cargoes
being
brought
to
them
with
very
great
delays
by
two
small
steamers
from
bagdad
these
steamers
draw
only
feet
of
water
and
realise
an
enormous
profit
bagdad
consists
of
a
few
miserable
wooden
shanties
which
have
sprung
into
existence
since
the
war
began
for
an
immense
distance
endless
bales
of
cotton
are
to
be
seen
immediately
we
landed
was
greeted
by
his
brother
merchants
he
introduced
me
to
mr
ituria
a
mexican
who
promised
to
take
me
in
his
buggy
to
brownsville
on
the
texan
bank
of
the
river
opposite
matamoros
was
to
follow
in
the
evening
to
matamoros
the
rio
grande
is
very
tortuous
and
shallow
the
distance
by
river
to
matamoros
is
miles
and
it
is
navigated
by
steamers
which
sometimes
perform
the
trip
in
twelve
hours
but
more
often
take
so
constantly
do
they
get
aground
the
distance
from
bagdad
to
matamoros
by
land
is
miles
on
the
texan
side
to
brownsville
miles
i
crossed
the
river
from
bagdad
with
mr
ituria
at
and
as
i
had
no
pass
i
was
taken
before
confederate
officers
who
were
seated
round
a
fire
contemplating
a
tin
of
potatoes
these
officers
belonged
to
duff
cavalry
duff
being
my
texan
partner
their
dress
consisted
simply
of
flannel
shirts
very
ancient
trousers
with
enormous
spurs
and
black
felt
hats
ornamented
with
the
lone
star
of
texas
they
looked
rough
and
dirty
but
were
extremely
civil
to
me
the
captain
was
rather
a
boaster
and
kept
on
remarking
we
given
h
ll
on
the
mississippi
h
ll
on
the
sabine
pronounced
sabeen
and
h
ll
in
various
other
places
he
explained
to
me
that
he
could
cross
the
river
to
see
as
he
with
some
of
his
men
had
made
a
raid
over
there
three
weeks
ago
and
carried
away
some
renegadoes
one
of
whom
named
mongomery
they
had
on
the
road
to
brownsville
by
the
smiles
of
the
other
officers
i
could
easily
guess
that
something
very
disagreeable
must
have
happened
to
mongomery
he
introduced
me
to
a
skipper
who
had
just
run
his
schooner
laden
with
cotton
from
galveston
and
who
was
much
elated
in
consequence
the
cotton
had
cost
cents
a
pound
in
galveston
and
is
worth
here
mr
ituria
and
i
left
for
brownsville
at
noon
a
buggy
is
a
light
gig
on
four
high
wheels
the
road
is
a
natural
one
the
country
quite
flat
and
much
covered
with
mosquite
trees
very
like
pepper
trees
every
person
we
met
carried
a
although
it
is
very
seldom
necessary
to
use
them
after
we
had
proceeded
about
nine
miles
we
met
general
bee
who
commands
the
troops
at
brownsville
he
was
travelling
to
boca
del
rio
in
an
ambulance
with
his
major
russell
i
gave
him
my
letter
of
introduction
to
general
magruder
and
told
him
who
i
was
he
thereupon
descended
from
his
ambulance
and
regaled
me
with
beef
and
beer
in
the
open
he
is
brother
to
the
general
bee
who
was
killed
at
manassas
we
talked
politics
and
fraternised
very
amicably
for
more
than
an
hour
he
said
the
mongomery
affair
was
against
his
sanction
and
he
was
sorry
for
it
he
said
that
davis
another
renegado
would
also
have
been
put
to
death
had
it
not
been
for
the
intercession
of
his
wife
general
bee
had
restored
davis
to
the
mexicans
half
an
hour
after
parting
company
with
general
bee
we
came
to
the
spot
where
mongomery
had
been
and
sure
enough
about
two
hundred
yards
to
the
left
of
the
road
we
found
him
he
had
been
slightly
buried
but
his
head
and
arms
were
above
the
ground
his
arms
tied
together
the
rope
still
round
his
neck
but
part
of
it
still
dangling
from
quite
a
small
mosquite
tree
dogs
or
wolves
had
probably
scraped
the
earth
from
the
body
and
there
was
no
flesh
on
the
bones
i
obtained
this
my
first
experience
of
lynch
law
within
three
hours
of
landing
in
america
i
understand
that
this
mongomery
was
a
man
of
very
bad
character
and
that
confiding
in
the
neutrality
of
the
mexican
soil
he
was
in
the
habit
of
calling
the
confederates
all
sorts
of
insulting
epithets
from
the
bagdad
bank
of
the
river
and
a
party
of
his
renegadoes
had
also
crossed
over
and
killed
some
unarmed
cotton
teamsters
which
had
roused
the
fury
of
the
confederates
about
three
miles
beyond
this
we
came
to
colonel
duff
encampment
he
is
a
handsome
scotchman
and
received
me
with
much
hospitality
his
regiment
consisted
of
volunteers
a
very
fine
body
of
young
men
who
were
drilling
in
squads
they
were
dressed
in
every
variety
of
costume
many
of
them
without
coats
but
all
wore
the
high
black
felt
hat
notwithstanding
the
peculiarity
of
their
attire
there
was
nothing
ridiculous
or
contemptible
in
the
appearance
of
these
men
who
all
looked
thoroughly
like
business
colonel
duff
told
me
that
many
of
the
privates
owned
vast
tracts
of
country
with
above
a
hundred
slaves
and
were
extremely
well
off
they
were
all
most
civil
to
me
their
horses
were
rather
animals
but
hardy
and
fast
the
saddles
they
used
were
nearly
like
the
mexican
colonel
duff
confessed
that
the
mongomery
affair
was
wrong
but
he
added
that
his
boys
we
reached
brownsville
at
and
mr
ituria
kindly
insisted
on
my
sleeping
at
his
house
instead
of
going
to
the
crowded
hotel
an
ambulance
is
a
light
waggon
and
generally
has
two
springs
behind
and
one
transverse
one
in
front
the
seats
can
be
so
arranged
that
two
or
even
three
persons
may
lie
at
full
length
good
friday
at
i
got
a
military
pass
to
cross
the
rio
grande
into
mexico
which
i
presented
to
the
sentry
who
then
allowed
me
to
cross
in
the
carriages
are
not
permitted
to
run
on
good
friday
in
mexico
so
i
had
a
hot
dusty
walk
of
more
than
a
mile
into
matamoros
mr
zorn
the
acting
british
consul
and
mr
behnsen
his
partner
invited
me
to
live
at
the
consulate
during
my
stay
at
matamoros
and
i
accepted
their
offer
with
much
gratitude
i
was
introduced
to
mr
colville
a
manchester
man
to
mr
maloney
one
of
the
principal
merchants
to
mr
bennet
an
englishman
one
of
the
owners
of
the
peterhoff
who
seemed
rather
elated
than
otherwise
when
he
heard
of
the
capture
of
his
vessel
as
he
said
the
case
was
such
a
gross
one
that
our
government
would
be
obliged
to
take
it
up
i
was
also
presented
to
the
gobernador
rather
a
rough
after
dining
with
mr
zorn
i
walked
back
to
the
rio
grande
which
i
was
allowed
to
cross
on
presenting
mr
colville
pass
to
the
mexican
soldiers
and
i
slept
at
mr
ituria
again
brownsville
is
a
straggling
town
of
about
inhabitants
most
of
its
houses
are
wooden
ones
and
its
streets
are
long
broad
and
straight
there
are
about
troops
under
general
bee
in
its
immediate
vicinity
its
prosperity
was
much
injured
when
matamoros
was
declared
a
free
port
after
crossing
the
rio
grande
a
wide
dusty
road
about
a
mile
in
length
leads
to
matamoros
which
is
a
mexican
city
of
about
inhabitants
its
houses
are
not
much
better
than
those
at
brownsville
and
they
bear
many
marks
of
the
numerous
revolutions
which
are
continually
taking
place
there
even
the
british
consulate
is
riddled
with
the
bullets
fired
in
the
mexicans
look
very
much
like
their
indian
forefathers
their
faces
being
extremely
dark
and
their
hair
black
and
straight
they
wear
hats
with
the
most
enormous
brims
and
delight
in
covering
their
jackets
and
leather
breeches
with
embroidery
some
of
the
women
are
rather
but
they
plaster
their
heads
with
grease
and
paint
their
faces
too
much
their
dress
is
rather
like
the
andalucian
when
i
went
to
the
cathedral
i
found
it
crammed
with
kneeling
women
an
effigy
of
our
saviour
was
being
taken
down
from
the
cross
and
put
into
a
golden
coffin
the
priest
haranguing
all
the
time
about
his
sufferings
and
all
the
women
howling
most
dismally
as
if
they
were
being
beaten
matamoros
is
now
infested
with
numbers
of
jews
whose
industry
spoils
the
trade
of
the
established
merchants
to
the
great
rage
of
the
latter
it
suffers
much
from
drought
and
there
had
been
no
rain
to
speak
of
for
eleven
months
i
am
told
that
it
is
a
common
thing
in
mexico
for
the
diligence
to
arrive
at
its
destination
with
the
blinds
down
this
is
a
sure
sign
that
the
travellers
both
male
and
female
have
been
stripped
by
robbers
nearly
to
the
skin
a
certain
quantity
of
clothing
is
then
as
a
matter
of
course
thrown
in
at
the
window
to
enable
them
to
descend
mr
behnsen
and
mr
maloney
told
me
they
had
seen
this
happen
several
times
and
mr
oetling
declared
that
he
himself
with
three
ladies
arrived
at
the
city
of
mexico
in
this
predicament
saturday
i
crossed
the
river
at
and
got
a
carriage
at
the
mexican
side
to
take
my
baggage
and
myself
to
the
consulate
at
matamoros
the
driver
his
animals
most
cruelly
the
mexicans
are
even
worse
than
the
spaniards
in
this
respect
i
called
on
mr
oetling
the
prussian
consul
who
is
one
of
the
richest
and
most
prosperous
merchants
in
matamoros
and
a
very
nice
fellow
after
dinner
we
went
to
a
or
fête
about
people
were
gambling
and
dancing
bad
imitations
of
european
dances
sunday
mr
zorn
or
don
pablo
as
he
is
called
here
her
majesty
acting
is
a
quaint
and
most
little
man
a
prussian
by
birth
he
is
overwhelmed
by
the
sudden
importance
he
has
acquired
from
his
office
and
by
the
amount
of
work
for
which
he
gets
no
pay
entailed
by
it
the
office
of
british
consul
having
been
a
comparative
sinecure
before
the
war
mr
behnsen
is
head
of
the
firm
the
principal
place
of
business
is
at
san
luis
potosi
a
considerable
city
in
the
interior
of
mexico
all
these
foreign
merchants
complain
bitterly
of
the
persecutions
and
extortion
they
have
to
endure
from
the
government
which
are
doubtless
most
annoying
but
nevertheless
they
appear
to
fatten
on
the
mexican
soil
i
crossed
to
brownsville
to
see
general
bee
but
he
had
not
returned
from
boca
del
rio
i
dined
with
mr
oetling
we
were
about
fourteen
at
dinner
principally
germans
a
very
merry
party
mr
oetling
is
supposed
to
have
made
a
million
of
dollars
for
his
firm
by
bold
cotton
speculations
since
the
war
we
all
went
to
the
theatre
afterwards
the
piece
was
an
attack
upon
the
french
and
upon
southern
institutions
monday
mr
behnsen
and
mr
colville
left
for
bagdad
this
morning
in
a
very
swell
ambulance
drawn
by
four
gay
mules
at
noon
i
crossed
to
brownsville
and
visited
captain
lynch
a
quartermaster
who
broke
open
a
great
box
and
presented
me
with
a
confederate
felt
hat
to
travel
in
he
then
took
me
to
the
garrison
and
introduced
me
to
colonel
buchel
of
the
texas
regiment
who
is
by
birth
a
german
but
had
served
in
the
french
army
and
he
prepared
cocktails
in
the
most
scientific
manner
i
returned
to
matamoros
at
captain
hancock
and
mr
anderson
the
paymaster
arrived
from
bagdad
in
a
most
miserable
vehicle
at
they
were
a
mass
of
dust
and
had
been
seven
hours
on
the
road
after
having
been
very
nearly
capsized
on
the
bar
there
was
a
great
firing
of
guns
and
squibs
in
the
afternoon
in
consequence
of
the
news
of
a
total
defeat
of
the
french
at
puebla
with
a
loss
of
prisoners
and
pieces
of
cannon
don

who
had
innocently
hoisted
his
british
flag
in
honour
of
captain
hancock
was
accused
by
his
brother
merchants
of
making
a
demonstration
against
the
french
after
dinner
we
called
on
mr
maloney
whose
house
is
gorgeously
furnished
and
who
has
a
pretty
wife
tuesday
mr
maloney
sent
us
his
carriage
to
conduct
captain
hancock
mr
anderson
and
myself
to
brownsville
we
first
called
on
colonels
luckett
and
buchel
the
former
is
a
handsome
man
a
doctor
by
profession
well
informed
and
agreeable
but
most
bitter
against
the
yankees
we
sat
for
an
hour
and
a
half
talking
with
these
officers
and
drinking
endless
cocktails
which
were
rather
good
and
required
five
or
six
different
liquids
to
make
them
we
then
adjourned
to
general
bee
with
whom
we
had
another
long
talk
and
with
whom
we
discussed
more
cocktails
at
the
general
we
were
introduced
to
a
englishman
mr
who
however
announced
to
us
that
he
had
abjured
his
nationality
until
great
britain
rendered
justice
to
the
south
two
years
since
this
individual
had
his
house
burnt
down
and
a
few
days
ago
happening
to
hear
that
one
of
the
incendiaries
was
on
the
mexican
bank
of
the
river
boasting
of
the
exploit
he
rowed
himself
across
shot
his
man
and
then
rowed
back
i
was
told
afterwards
that
notwithstanding
the
sentiments
he
had
given
out
before
us
mr
is
a
stanch
britisher
always
ready
to
produce
his
at
a
notice
at
any
insult
to
the
queen
or
to
england
we
were
afterwards
presented
to
rather
a
party
with
long
yellow
hair
down
to
his
shoulders
this
is
the
man
who
is
supposed
to
have
hanged
mongomery
we
were
treated
by
all
the
officers
with
the
greatest
consideration
and
conducted
to
the
place
of
embarkation
with
much
ceremony
colonel
luckett
declared
i
should
not
leave
brownsville
until
general
magruder
arrives
he
is
expected
every
day
mr
maloney
afterwards
told
us
that
these
officers
having
given
up
everything
for
their
country
were
many
of
them
in
great
poverty
he
doubted
whether
had
a
second
pair
of
boots
in
the
world
but
he
added
that
to
do
honour
to
british
officers
they
would
scour
brownsville
for
the
materials
for
cocktails
at
we
dined
with
mr
maloney
who
is
one
of
the
principal
and
most
enterprising
british
merchants
at
matamoros
and
enjoyed
his
hospitality
till
his
wine
was
good
and
he
made
us
drink
a
good
deal
of
it
mr
oetling
was
there
and
his
stories
of
highway
robberies
and
of
his
journeys
were
most
amusing
at
mr
oetling
conducted
us
to
the
grand
fandango
given
in
honour
of
the
reported
victory
over
the
french
a
mexican
fandango
resembles
a
french
with
the
additional
excitement
of
gambling
it
commences
at
and
continues
till
daylight
the
scene
is
lit
up
by
numerous
paper
lanterns
of
various
colours
a
number
of
benches
are
placed
so
as
to
form
a
large
square
in
the
centre
of
which
the
dancing
goes
on
the
men
and
women
gravely
smoking
all
the
time
outside
the
benches
is
the
promenade
bounded
by
the
and
on
this
occasion
there
must
have
been
thirty
or
forty
some
of
the
smaller
ones
presided
over
by
old
women
and
others
by
small
boys
monté
is
the
favourite
game
and
the
smallest
silver
coin
can
be
staked
or
a
handful
of
doubloons
most
of
these
tables
were
patronised
by
crowds
of
all
classes
intent
on
gambling
with
grave
serious
faces
under
their
enormous
hats
they
never
moved
a
muscle
whether
they
won
or
lost
although
the
number
of
people
at
these
fandangos
is
very
great
yet
the
whole
affair
is
conducted
with
an
order
and
regularity
not
to
be
equalled
in
an
assembly
of
a
much
higher
class
in
europe
if
there
ever
is
a
row
it
is
invariably
caused
by
texans
from
brownsville
these
turbulent
spirits
are
at
once
seized
and
cooled
in
the
calaboose
it
seems
he
has
been
dreadfully
riled
by
the
late
peterhoff
affair
wednesday
poor
don
pablo
was
taken
ill
at
breakfast
and
was
obliged
to
go
to
bed
we
were
all
much
distressed
at
his
illness
which
was
brought
on
by
connected
with
his
official
duties
and
the
way
he
is
bothered
by
english
and
skippers
is
enough
to
try
any
one
mr
behnsen
and
mr
colville
returned
from
bagdad
this
afternoon
much
disgusted
with
the
attractions
of
that
city
general
bee
orderly
was
assaulted
in
matamoros
yesterday
by
a
renegado
with
a
this
circumstance
prevented
the
general
from
coming
to
matamoros
as
he
had
intended
at
captain
hancock
and
i
crossed
over
to
brownsville
and
were
conducted
in
a
very
smart
ambulance
to
general
bee
quarters
and
afterwards
to
see
a
dress
parade
of
the
texas
infantry
buchel
is
the
of
the
corps
as
he
is
a
professional
soldier
the
men
were
well
clothed
though
great
variety
existed
in
their
uniforms
some
companies
wore
blue
some
grey
some
had
french
others
wideawakes
and
mexican
hats
they
were
a
fine
body
of
men
and
really
drilled
uncommonly
well
they
went
through
a
sort
of
parade
in
a
most
creditable
manner
about
a
hundred
out
of
a
thousand
were
conscripts
after
the
parade
we
adjourned
to
colonel
luckett
to
drink
prosperity
to
the
regiment
we
afterwards
had
a
very
agreeable
dinner
with
general
bee
colonels
luckett
and
buchel
dined
also
the
latter
is
a
regular
soldier
of
fortune
he
served
in
the
french
and
turkish
armies
as
also
in
the
carlist
and
the
mexican
wars
and
i
was
told
he
had
been
a
principal
in
many
affairs
of
honour
but
he
is
a
quiet
and
unassuming
little
man
and
although
a
sincere
southerner
is
not
nearly
so
violent
against
the
yankees
as
luckett
at
captain
hancock
and
myself
went
to
a
ball
given
by
the
authorities
of
the
heroica
y
invicta
ciudad
de
matamoros
as
they
choose
to
call
it
in
honour
of
the
french
defeat
general
bee
and
colonel
luckett
also
went
to
this
fête
the
invitation
being
the
first
civility
they
had
received
since
the
violation
of
the
mexican
soil
in
the
affair
they
were
dressed
in
plain
clothes
and
carried
pistols
concealed
in
case
of
accidents
we
all
drove
together
from
brownsville
to
the
consulate
and
entered
the
the
outside
of
the
municipal
hall
was
lit
up
with
some
splendour
and
it
was
graced
by
a
big
placard
on
which
was
written
the
amiable
sentiment
napoleon
viva
mejico
squibs
and
crackers
were
let
off
at
intervals
in
the
square
also
was
a
triumphal
arch
with
an
inscription
to
the
effect
that
the
effete
nations
of
europe
might
tremble
i
made
great
friends
with
the
gobernador
and
administrador
who
endeavoured
to
entice
me
into
dancing
but
i
excused
myself
by
saying
that
europeans
were
unable
to
dance
in
the
graceful
mexican
fashion
captain
hancock
was
much
horrified
when
this
gobernador
who
keeps
a
small
shop
stated
his
intention
of
visiting
the
immortalité
with
six
of
his
friends
and
sleeping
on
board
for
a
night
or
two
the
dances
were
a
sort
of
slow
valse
and
between
the
dances
the
girls
were
planted
up
against
the
wall
and
not
allowed
to
be
spoken
to
by
any
one
they
were
mostly
a
lot
and
ridiculously
dressed
during
all
my
travels
in
the
south
i
never
saw
a
regiment
so
well
clothed
or
so
well
drilled
as
this
one
which
has
never
been
in
action
or
been
exposed
to
much
hardship
thursday
captain
hancock
and
mr
anderson
left
for
bagdad
in
mr
behnsen
carriage
at
noon
i
crossed
over
to
brownsville
at
and
dined
with
colonels
luckett
buchel
and
duff
at
about
one
as
we
were
all
colonels
and
as
every
one
called
the
other
colonel
it
was
difficult
to
make
out
which
was
meant
they
were
obliged
to
confess
that
brownsville
was
about
the
rowdiest
town
of
texas
which
was
the
most
lawless
state
in
the
confederacy
but
they
declared
they
had
never
seen
an
inoffensive
man
subjected
to
insult
or
annoyance
although
the
and
systems
are
much
in
vogue
being
almost
a
necessity
in
a
state
much
frequented
by
desperadoes
driven
away
from
more
civilised
countries
colonel
luckett
gave
me
a
letter
to
general
van
dorn
whom
they
consider
the
of
a
cavalry
soldier
they
said
from
time
immemorial
the
yankees
had
been
despised
by
the
southerners
as
a
race
inferior
to
themselves
in
courage
and
in
honourable
sentiments
at
colonel
buchel
and
i
rode
to
colonel
duff
camp
distant
about
thirteen
miles
i
was
given
a
mexican
saddle
in
which
one
is
forced
to
sit
almost
in
a
standing
position
the
stirrups
are
very
long
and
right
underneath
you
which
throws
back
the
feet
duff
regiment
is
called
the
partisan
rangers
although
a
fine
lot
of
men
they
do
look
well
at
a
foot
parade
on
account
of
the
small
amount
of
drill
they
have
undergone
and
the
extreme
disorder
of
their
clothing
they
are
armed
with
carbines
and
i
saw
some
men
come
in
from
a
scouting
expedition
against
the
indians
miles
off
they
told
me
they
were
usually
in
the
habit
of
scalping
an
indian
when
they
caught
him
and
that
they
never
spared
one
as
they
were
such
an
untamable
and
ferocious
race
another
habit
which
they
have
learned
from
the
indians
is
to
squat
on
their
heels
in
a
most
peculiar
manner
it
has
an
absurd
and
extraordinary
effect
to
see
a
quantity
of
them
so
squatting
in
a
row
or
in
a
circle
the
regiment
had
been
employed
in
quelling
a
counter
revolution
of
unionists
in
texas
nothing
could
exceed
the
rancour
with
which
they
spoke
of
these
renegadoes
as
they
called
them
who
were
principally
germans
when
i
suggested
to
some
of
the
texans
that
they
might
as
well
bury
the
body
of
mongomery
a
little
better
they
did
not
at
all
agree
with
me
but
said
it
ought
not
to
have
been
buried
at
all
but
left
hanging
as
a
warning
to
other
with
regard
to
the
contentment
of
their
slaves
colonel
duff
pointed
out
a
good
number
they
had
with
them
who
had
only
to
cross
the
river
for
freedom
if
they
wished
it
colonel
buchel
and
i
slept
in
colonel
duff
tent
and
at
night
we
were
the
officers
and
men
really
sang
uncommonly
well
and
they
finished
with
god
save
the
queen
colonel
duff
comes
from
perth
he
was
one
of
the
leading
characters
in
the
secession
of
texas
and
he
said
his
brother
was
a
banker
in
dunkeld
friday
we
roused
up
at
daylight
and
soon
afterwards
colonel
duff
paraded
some
of
his
best
men
to
show
off
the
texan
horsemanship
of
which
they
are
very
proud
i
saw
them
lasso
cattle
and
catch
them
by
the
tail
at
full
gallop
and
throw
them
by
slewing
them
round
this
is
called
tailing
they
pick
small
objects
off
the
ground
when
at
full
tilt
and
in
their
peculiar
fashion
are
beautiful
riders
but
they
confessed
to
me
they
could
not
ride
in
an
english
saddle
and
colonel
duff
told
me
that
they
could
not
jump
a
fence
at
all
they
were
all
extremely
anxious
to
hear
what
i
thought
of
the
performance
and
their
thorough
good
opinion
of
themselves
was
most
amusing
at
colonel
buchel
and
i
rode
back
to
brownsville
but
as
we
lost
our
way
twice
and
were
enveloped
in
clouds
of
dust
it
was
not
a
very
satisfactory
ride
poor
captain
hancock
must
be
luxuriating
at
bagdad
for
with
this
wind
the
bar
must
be
impassable
to
the
boldest
mariner
in
the
evening
a
mr
a
texan
unionist
or
renegado
gave
us
his
sentiments
at
the
consulate
and
drank
a
deal
of
brandy
he
finished
however
by
the
toast
them
as
wants
to
fight
let
fight
i
do
saturday
mr
the
unionist
came
to
me
this
morning
and
said
in
a
contrite
manner
i
hope
kernel
that
in
the
fumes
of
brandy
i
did
say
anything
offensive
last
night
i
assured
him
that
he
had
i
have
now
become
comparatively
accustomed
and
reconciled
to
the
necessity
of
shaking
hands
and
drinking
brandy
with
every
one
the
ambulance
returned
from
bagdad
captain
hancock
had
managed
to
cross
the
bar
in
mr
oetling
steamer
or
lighter
but
was
very
nearly
capsized
i
went
to
a
grand
supper
given
by
mr
oetling
in
honour
of
mr
departure
for
the
city
of
mexico
this
it
appears
is
the
custom
of
the
country
this
necessity
does
not
exist
except
in
texas
sunday
i
took
an
affectionate
leave
of
don
pablo
behnsen
oetling
all
of
whom
were
in
rather
weak
health
on
account
of
last
night
supper
the
excellent
maloney
insisted
on
providing
me
with
preserved
meats
and
brandy
for
my
arduous
journey
through
texas
i
feel
extremely
grateful
for
the
kindness
of
all
these
gentlemen
who
rendered
my
stay
in
matamoros
very
agreeable
the
hotel
would
have
been
intolerable
i
crossed
to
brownsville
at
where
i
was
hospitably
received
by
my
friend
ituria
who
confesses
to
having
made
a
deal
of
money
lately
by
cotton
speculations
i
attended
evening
parade
and
saw
general
bee
colonels
luckett
buchel
duff
and
the
latter
who
hanged
mongomery
improves
on
acquaintance
general
bee
took
me
for
a
drive
in
his
ambulance
and
introduced
me
to
major
leon
smith
who
captured
the
harriet
lane
the
latter
pressed
me
most
vehemently
to
wait
until
general
magruder
arrival
and
he
promised
if
i
did
so
that
i
should
be
sent
to
san
antonio
in
a
ambulance
major
leon
smith
is
a
seafaring
man
by
profession
and
was
put
by
general
magruder
in
command
of
one
of
the
small
steamers
which
captured
the
harriet
lane
at
galveston
the
crews
of
the
steamers
being
composed
of
texan
cavalry
soldiers
he
told
me
that
the
resistance
offered
after
boarding
was
feeble
and
he
declared
that
had
not
the
remainder
of
the
yankee
vessels
escaped
unfairly
under
flag
of
truce
they
would
likewise
have
been
taken
after
the
harriet
lane
had
been
captured
she
was
fired
into
by
the
other
ships
and
major
smith
told
me
that
his
blood
being
up
he
sent
the
of
the
harriet
lane
to
commodore
renshaw
with
a
message
that
unless
the
firing
was
stopped
he
would
the
captured
crew
after
hearing
this
commodore
renshaw
blew
up
his
ship
with
himself
in
her
after
having
given
an
order
to
the
remainder
qui
monday
i
breakfasted
with
general
bee
and
took
leave
of
all
my
brownsville
friends
is
to
give
me
four
times
the
value
of
my
gold
in
confederate
notes
we
left
brownsville
for
san
antonio
at
our
vehicle
was
a
roomy
but
rather
carriage
with
a
canvass
roof
and
four
mules
besides
there
was
a
third
passenger
in
the
shape
of
a
young
merchant
of
the
hebrew
persuasion
two
horses
were
to
join
us
to
help
us
through
the
deep
sand
the
country
on
leaving
brownsville
is
quite
flat
the
road
a
natural
one
sandy
and
very
dusty
and
there
are
many
small
trees
principally
mosquites
after
we
had
proceeded
seven
miles
we
halted
to
water
the
mules
at
a
new
character
appeared
upon
the
scene
in
the
shape
of
an
elderly
man
who
rode
up
mounted
on
a
sorry
nag
to
my
surprise
he
was
addressed
by
with
the
title
of
judge
and
asked
what
he
had
done
with
our
other
horse
the
judge
replied
that
it
had
already
broken
down
and
had
been
left
behind
informs
me
that
this
worthy
really
is
a
magistrate
or
sort
of
judge
in
his
own
district
but
he
now
appears
in
the
capacity
of
assistant
and
is
to
make
himself
generally
useful
i
could
not
help
feeling
immensely
amused
at
this
specimen
of
a
texan
judge
we
started
again
about
and
soon
emerged
from
the
mosquite
bushes
into
an
open
prairie
eight
miles
long
quite
desolate
and
producing
nothing
but
a
sort
of
rush
after
which
we
entered
a
chaparal
or
thick
covert
of
mosquite
trees
and
high
prickly
pears
these
border
the
track
and
are
covered
with
bits
of
cotton
torn
from
the
endless
trains
of
cotton
waggons
we
met
several
of
these
waggons
generally
there
were
ten
oxen
or
six
mules
to
a
waggon
carrying
ten
bales
but
in
deep
sand
more
animals
are
necessary
they
journey
very
slowly
towards
brownsville
from
places
in
the
interior
of
texas
at
least
five
hundred
miles
distant
want
of
water
and
other
causes
make
the
drivers
and
animals
undergo
much
hardship
the
judge
rides
on
in
front
of
us
on
his
rosinante
to
encourage
the
mules
his
back
view
reminds
one
in
a
ludicrous
manner
of
the
pictures
of
dr
syntax
mr
sargent
our
portly
driver
cheers
his
animals
by
the
continual
repetition
of
the
sentence
get
up
now
you
great
g
d
d
d
son
of
a
at
we
reached
a
well
with
a
farm
or
ranch
close
to
it
here
we
halted
for
the
night
a
cotton
train
was
encamped
close
to
us
and
a
lugubrious
teamster
informed
us
that
three
of
his
oxen
had
been
stolen
last
night
in
order
to
make
a
fire
we
were
forced
to
enter
the
chaparal
for
wood
and
in
doing
so
we
ran
many
prickles
into
our
legs
which
caused
us
great
annoyance
afterwards
as
they
fester
if
not
immediately
pulled
out
the
water
at
this
well
was
very
salt
and
made
very
indifferent
coffee
called
it
the
meanest
we
shall
have
at
spread
a
on
the
sand
near
the
carriage
on
which
we
should
have
slept
very
comfortably
had
it
not
been
for
the
prickles
the
activity
of
many
fleas
and
the
incursions
of
wild
hogs
mr
sargent
and
the
judge
with
much
presence
of
mind
had
encamped
seventy
yards
off
and
left
to
us
the
duty
of
driving
away
these
hogs
i
was
twice
awoke
by
one
of
these
unclean
animals
breathing
in
my
face
we
did
about
miles
the
value
of
confederate
paper
has
since
decreased
at
charleston
i
was
offered
six
to
one
for
my
gold
and
at
richmond
eight
to
one
tuesday
when
we
roused
up
at
we
found
our
clothes
saturated
with
the
heavy
dew
also
that
notwithstanding
our
exertions
the
hogs
had
devoured
the
greatest
part
of
our
pet
kid
our
only
fresh
meat
after
feeding
our
mules
upon
the
indian
corn
we
had
brought
with
us
and
drinking
a
little
more
coffee
the
judge
hitched
in
and
we
got
under
way
at
the
country
just
the
same
as
yesterday
a
dead
level
of
sand
mosquite
trees
and
prickly
pears
at
we
reached
leatham
ranch
and
watered
our
mules
as
the
water
was
tolerable
we
refilled
our
i
also
washed
my
face
during
which
operation
mr
sargent
expressed
great
astonishment
not
unmingled
with
contempt
at
leatham
we
met
a
wealthy
texan
speculator
and
contractor
called
major
or
judge
hart
i
find
that
judge
is
also
an
and
that
in
his
capacity
as
a
member
of
the
texan
legislature
he
is
entitled
to
be
styled
the
honourable
at
we
halted
in
the
middle
of
a
prairie
on
which
there
was
a
little
grass
for
the
mules
and
we
prepared
to
eat
in
the
midst
of
our
cooking
two
deer
came
up
quite
close
to
us
and
could
easily
have
been
killed
with
rifles
we
saw
quantities
of
which
are
big
sort
of
composed
of
sticks
and
earth
built
by
the
rats
mr
sargent
our
conductor
is
a
very
rough
customer
a
fat
man
who
never
opens
his
mouth
without
an
oath
strictly
american
in
its
character
he
and
the
judge
are
always
snarling
at
one
another
and
both
are
much
addicted
to
liquor
we
live
principally
on
bacon
and
coffee
but
as
the
water
and
the
bacon
are
both
very
salt
this
is
very
inconvenient
we
have
however
got
some
claret
and
plenty
of
brandy
during
the
halts
mr
sargent
is
in
the
habit
of
cooling
himself
by
removing
his
trousers
or
pants
and
having
gorged
himself
he
lies
down
and
issues
his
edicts
to
the
judge
as
to
the
treatment
of
the
mules
at
the
hitched
in
again
and
at
we
reached
a
arm
of
the
sea
called
the
aroyo
del
colorado
about
eighty
yards
broad
which
we
crossed
in
a
half
an
hour
later
we
struck
water
again
which
being
superior
to
leatham
we
filled
up
we
are
continually
passing
cotton
trains
going
to
brownsville
also
government
waggons
with
stores
for
the
interior
near
every
well
is
a
small
farm
or
ranch
a
miserable
little
wooden
edifice
surrounded
by
a
little
cultivation
the
natives
all
speak
spanish
and
wear
the
mexican
dress
is
very
proud
of
his
knowledge
of
the
country
in
spite
of
which
he
is
often
out
in
his
calculations
the
different
tracks
are
so
similar
to
one
another
they
are
easily
mistaken
at
we
halted
at
a
much
better
place
than
yesterday
we
are
obliged
to
halt
where
a
little
grass
can
be
found
for
our
mules
soon
after
we
had
unpacked
for
the
night
six
texan
rangers
of
wood
regiment
rode
up
to
us
they
were
very
picturesque
fellows
tall
thin
and
ragged
but
quite
gentlemanlike
in
their
manners
we
are
always
to
sleep
in
the
open
until
we
arrive
at
san
antonio
and
i
find
my
turkish
lantern
most
useful
at
night
a
lantern
for
a
candle
made
of
white
linen
and
wire
which
collapses
when
not
in
use
they
are
always
used
in
the
streets
of
constantinople
the
texans
admired
it
immensely
wednesday
i
slept
well
last
night
in
spite
of
the
tics
and
fleas
and
we
started
at
after
passing
a
dead
rattlesnake
eight
feet
long
we
reached
water
at
at
we
espied
the
cavalcade
of
general
magruder
passing
us
by
a
parallel
track
about
half
a
mile
distant
and
i
jumped
out
of
the
carriage
and
i
ran
across
the
prairie
to
cut
him
off
which
i
just
succeeded
in
doing
by
borrowing
the
spare
horse
of
the
last
man
in
the
train
i
galloped
up
to
the
front
and
found
the
general
riding
with
a
lady
who
was
introduced
to
me
as
mrs
an
undeniably
pretty
woman
wife
to
an
officer
on
magruder
staff
and
she
is
naturally
the
object
of
intense
attention
to
all
the
officers
who
accompany
the
general
through
this
desert
general
magruder
who
commands
in
texas
is
a
fine
soldierlike
man
of
about
with
broad
shoulders
a
florid
complexion
and
bright
eyes
he
wears
his
whiskers
and
mustaches
in
the
english
fashion
and
he
was
dressed
in
the
confederate
grey
uniform
he
was
kind
enough
to
beg
that
i
would
turn
back
and
accompany
him
in
his
tour
through
texas
he
had
heard
of
my
arrival
and
was
fully
determined
i
should
do
this
he
asked
after
several
officers
of
my
regiment
whom
he
had
known
when
he
was
on
the
canadian
frontier
he
is
a
virginian
a
great
talker
and
has
always
been
a
great
ally
of
english
officers
he
insisted
that
and
i
should
turn
and
dine
with
him
promising
to
provide
us
with
horses
to
catch
up
mr
sargent
after
we
had
agreed
to
do
this
i
had
a
long
and
agreeable
conversation
with
the
general
who
spoke
of
the
puritans
with
intense
disgust
and
of
the
first
importation
of
them
as
pestiferous
crew
of
the
but
he
is
by
no
means
rancorous
against
individual
yankees
he
spoke
very
favourably
of
whom
he
knew
to
be
a
gentleman
clever
and
personally
brave
though
he
might
lack
moral
courage
to
face
responsibility
magruder
had
commanded
the
confederate
troops
at
yorktown
which
opposed
advance
he
told
me
the
different
dodges
he
had
resorted
to
to
blind
and
deceive
the
latter
as
to
his
magruder
strength
and
he
spoke
of
the
intense
relief
and
amusement
with
which
he
had
at
length
seen
with
his
magnified
army
begin
to
break
ground
before
miserable
earthworks
defended
only
by
men
hooker
was
in
his
regiment
and
was
essentially
a
mean
man
and
a
liar
of
lee
and
longstreet
he
spoke
in
terms
of
the
highest
admiration
magruder
was
an
artilleryman
and
has
been
a
good
deal
in
europe
and
having
been
much
stationed
on
the
canadian
frontier
he
became
acquainted
with
many
british
officers
particularly
those
in
the
hussars
and
guards
he
had
gained
much
credit
from
his
recent
successes
at
galveston
and
sabine
pass
in
which
he
had
the
temerity
to
attack
vessels
of
war
with
wretched
river
steamers
manned
by
texan
cavalrymen
his
principal
reason
for
visiting
brownsville
was
to
settle
about
the
cotton
trade
he
had
issued
an
edict
that
half
the
value
of
cotton
exported
must
be
imported
in
goods
for
the
benefit
of
the
country
government
stores
the
president
had
condemned
this
order
as
illegal
and
despotic
the
officers
on
magruder
staff
are
a
very
gentlemanlike
set
of
men
their
names
are
major
pendleton
major
wray
captain
de
ponté
captain
alston
captain
turner
captain
dwyer
dr
benien
lieutenant
stanard
lieutenant
yancey
and
major
magruder
the
latter
is
nephew
to
the
general
and
is
a
particularly
young
fellow
they
all
live
with
their
chief
on
an
extremely
agreeable
footing
and
form
a
very
pleasant
society
at
dinner
i
was
put
in
the
post
of
honour
which
is
always
fought
for
with
much
acrimony
the
right
of
mrs
after
dinner
we
had
numerous
songs
both
the
general
and
his
nephew
sang
so
also
did
captain
alston
whose
corpulent
frame
however
was
too
much
for
the
feeble
which
caused
his
sudden
disappearance
in
the
midst
of
a
song
with
a
loud
crash
captain
dwyer
played
the
fiddle
very
well
and
an
aged
and
militia
general
brewed
the
punch
and
made
several
elegant
speeches
the
latter
was
a
old
hero
and
gloried
in
the
name
of
on
these
festive
occasions
general
magruder
wears
a
red
woollen
cap
and
fills
the
president
chair
with
great
aptitude
it
was
before
i
could
tear
myself
away
from
this
agreeable
party
but
at
length
i
effected
my
exit
amidst
a
profusion
of
kind
expressions
and
laden
with
heaps
of
letters
of
introduction
thursday
now
our
troubles
commenced
seated
in
mexican
saddles
and
mounted
on
mustangs
whose
energy
had
been
a
good
deal
impaired
by
a
month
steady
travelling
on
bad
food
and
i
left
the
hospitable
about
midnight
and
started
in
search
of
mr
sargent
and
his
vehicle
we
were
under
the
guidance
of
two
texan
rangers
about
daylight
we
hove
in
sight
of
los
animos
a
desolate
farmhouse
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
mr
sargent
was
supposed
to
be
encamped
but
nowhere
could
we
find
any
traces
of
him
we
had
now
reached
the
confines
of
a
dreary
region
sixty
miles
in
extent
called
the
sands
in
comparison
with
which
the
prairie
and
chaparal
were
luxurious
the
sand
being
deep
and
the
wind
high
we
could
not
trace
the
carriage
but
we
soon
acquired
a
certainty
that
our
perfidious
jehu
had
decamped
leaving
us
behind
we
floundered
about
in
the
sand
cursing
our
bad
luck
cursing
mr
sargent
and
even
the
good
magruder
as
the
indirect
cause
of
our
wretchedness
our
situation
indeed
was
sufficiently
deplorable
we
were
without
food
or
water
in
the
midst
of
a
desert
so
were
our
horses
which
were
nearly
done
up
our
bones
ached
from
the
mexican
saddles
and
to
complete
our
misery
the
two
rangers
began
to
turn
restive
and
talk
of
returning
with
the
horses
at
this
the
climax
of
our
misfortunes
i
luckily
hit
upon
a
mexican
who
gave
us
intelligence
of
our
carriage
and
with
renewed
spirits
but
very
groggy
horses
we
gave
chase
but
never
did
mr
sargent
mules
walk
at
such
a
pace
and
it
was
before
we
overtook
them
my
animal
had
been
twice
on
his
head
and
was
green
in
the
face
with
fatigue
and
rage
mr
sargent
received
us
with
the
greatest
affability
and
we
were
sensible
enough
not
to
quarrel
with
him
although
had
made
many
allusions
as
to
the
advisability
of
shooting
him
we
had
been
nine
and
a
half
hours
in
the
saddle
and
were
a
good
deal
exhausted
our
sulky
texan
guides
were
appeased
with
bacon
coffee
and
in
coin
we
halted
till
and
then
renewed
our
struggle
through
the
deep
sandy
wilderness
but
though
the
services
of
the
judge
horse
were
put
into
requisition
we
could
progress
faster
than
two
miles
an
hour
is
an
art
of
itself
and
mr
sargent
is
justly
considered
a
at
it
he
is
always
yelling
generally
imprecations
of
a
character
he
rarely
flogs
his
mules
but
when
one
of
them
rouses
his
indignation
by
extraordinary
laziness
he
roars
out
come
here
judge
with
a
big
club
and
give
him
h
ll
whilst
the
animal
is
receiving
such
discipline
as
comes
up
to
the
judge
idea
of
the
infernal
regions
mr
sargent
generally
remarks
i
wish
you
was
uncle
abe
i
make
you
move
you
g
d
d
n
son
of
a
his
idea
of
perfect
happiness
seems
to
be
to
have
messrs
lincoln
and
seward
in
the
shafts
mules
travel
much
better
when
other
mules
are
in
front
of
them
and
another
dodge
to
which
mr
sargent
continually
resorts
is
to
beat
the
top
of
the
carriage
and
kick
the
which
makes
a
noise
and
gratifies
the
mules
quite
as
much
as
licking
them
mr
sargent
accounts
for
his
humanity
by
saying
it
the
worst
plan
in
the
world
licking
niggers
or
mules
because
the
more
you
licks
the
more
they
wants
it
we
reached
or
struck
water
at
but
in
spite
of
its
good
reputation
it
was
so
salt
as
to
be
scarcely
drinkable
a
number
of
cotton
waggons
and
three
carriages
belonging
to
mr
ward
were
also
encamped
with
us
we
have
only
made
sixteen
miles
friday
having
spent
last
night
in
a
mexican
saddle
our
in
the
sand
appeared
to
me
a
most
luxurious
bed
we
hitched
in
at
and
struck
water
at
which
though
muddy
in
appearance
was
not
so
bad
to
drink
i
walked
ahead
with
the
judge
who
when
sober
is
a
and
sensible
man
mr
sargent
and
i
are
great
friends
and
rough
as
he
is
we
get
on
capitally
together
a
mr
ward
with
three
vehicles
a
rival
of
mr
sargent
is
travelling
in
our
company
he
drove
his
buggy
against
a
tree
and
knocked
its
top
off
to
the
intense
delight
of
the
latter
we
breakfasted
under
difficulties
the
wind
being
high
it
drove
up
the
sand
in
clouds
and
spoiled
our
food
our
travelling
companion
mr
is
a
poor
little
weakly
israelite
but
very
inoffensive
although
he
speaks
with
a
horrible
yankee
twang
which
mr
sargent
and
the
judge
are
singularly
free
from
we
went
on
again
at
i
had
a
long
talk
with
a
big
mulatto
slave
woman
who
was
driving
one
of
ward
waggons
she
told
me
she
had
been
raised
in
tennessee
and
that
three
years
ago
she
had
been
taken
from
her
mistress
for
a
bad
debt
to
their
mutual
sorrow
both
she
said
cried
bitterly
at
parting
she
does
like
san
antonio
at
all
too
much
hanging
and
murdering
for
me
she
said
she
had
seen
a
man
hanged
in
the
middle
of
the
day
just
in
front
of
her
door
mr
sargent
bought
two
chickens
and
some
eggs
at
a
ranch
but
one
of
the
chickens
got
up
a
tree
and
was
caught
and
eaten
by
the
ward
faction
our
camp
looks
very
pretty
by
the
light
of
the
fires
saturday
at
daylight
we
discovered
to
our
horror
that
three
of
our
mules
were
absent
but
after
an
hour
search
they
were
brought
back
in
triumph
by
the
judge
this
delayed
our
start
till
i
walked
ahead
again
with
the
judge
who
explained
to
me
that
he
was
a
senator
or
member
of
the
upper
house
of
texas
just
like
your
house
of
lords
he
said
he
gets
whilst
sitting
and
is
elected
for
four
years
we
struck
water
at
and
bought
a
lamb
for
a
dollar
we
also
bought
some
beef
which
in
this
country
is
dried
in
strips
by
the
sun
after
being
cut
off
the
bullock
and
it
keeps
good
for
any
length
of
time
to
cook
it
the
strips
are
thrown
for
a
few
minutes
on
hot
embers
one
of
our
mules
was
kicked
last
night
mr
sargent
rubbed
the
wound
with
brandy
which
did
it
much
good
soon
after
leaving
this
well
mr
sargent
discovered
that
by
following
the
track
of
mr
ward
waggons
he
had
lost
the
way
he
swore
dreadfully
and
solaced
himself
with
so
much
gin
that
when
we
arrived
at
sulphur
creek
at
both
he
and
the
judge
were
by
their
own
confession
we
halted
ate
some
salt
meat
and
bathed
in
this
creek
which
is
about
forty
yards
broad
and
three
feet
deep
mr
sargent
extreme
tightness
caused
him
to
fall
asleep
on
the
box
when
we
started
again
but
the
more
seasoned
judge
drove
the
mules
the
signs
of
getting
out
of
the
sands
now
began
to
be
apparent
and
at
we
were
able
to
halt
at
a
very
decent
place
with
grass
but
we
suffered
here
for
want
of
water
our
stock
being
very
nearly
expended
mr
sargent
who
was
now
comparatively
sober
killed
the
sheep
most
scientifically
at
and
at
we
were
actually
devouring
it
and
found
it
very
good
mr
sargent
cooked
it
by
the
simple
process
of
stewing
junks
of
it
in
a
but
we
had
only
just
enough
water
to
do
this
i
was
afterwards
told
that
the
judge
term
of
service
had
expired
el
paso
was
his
district
sunday
at
this
morning
our
slumbers
on
the
were
disturbed
by
a
sudden
and
most
violent
thunderstorm
and
i
had
only
just
time
to
rush
into
the
carriage
and
hustle
our
traps
underneath
it
when
the
rain
began
to
descend
in
torrents
we
got
inside
with
the
little
jew
who
was
much
alarmed
by
the
thunder
whilst
mr
sargent
and
the
judge
crept
underneath
the
rain
lasted
two
hours
and
at
daylight
we
were
able
to
refresh
ourselves
by
drinking
the
water
from
the
puddles
and
effect
a
start
but
fate
seemed
adverse
to
our
progress
no
sooner
had
we
escaped
from
the
sand
than
we
fell
into
the
mud
which
was
still
worse
we
toiled
on
till
at
which
hour
we
reached
which
for
several
days
i
had
heard
spoken
of
as
a
sort
of
elysium
marking
as
it
does
the
termination
of
the
sands
and
the
commencement
of
comparative
civilisation
we
halted
in
front
of
the
house
and
after
cooking
and
eating
i
walked
up
to
the
ranch
which
is
a
comfortable
wooden
building
mr
and
mrs
king
had
gone
to
brownsville
but
we
were
received
by
mrs
bee
the
wife
of
the
brownsville
general
who
had
heard
i
was
on
the
road
she
is
a
nice
lively
little
woman
a
southerner
glorying
in
the
facts
that
she
has
no
northern
relations
or
friends
and
that
she
is
a
member
of
the
church
of
england
mr
king
first
came
to
texas
as
a
steamboat
captain
but
now
owns
an
immense
tract
of
country
with
head
of
cattle
situated
however
in
a
wild
and
almost
uninhabited
district
king
ranch
is
distant
from
brownsville
only
miles
and
we
have
been
six
days
in
reaching
it
after
drying
our
clothes
and
our
food
after
the
rain
of
last
night
we
started
again
at
we
now
entered
a
boundless
and
most
fertile
prairie
upon
which
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
cattle
were
feeding
bulls
and
cows
horses
and
mares
came
to
stare
at
us
as
we
passed
they
all
seemed
sleek
and
in
good
condition
yet
they
get
nothing
but
what
they
can
pick
up
on
the
prairie
i
saw
a
man
on
horseback
kill
a
rabbit
with
his
revolver
i
also
saw
a
scorpion
for
the
first
time
we
halted
at
and
had
to
make
our
fire
principally
of
as
wood
is
very
scarce
on
this
prairie
we
gave
up
the
judge
horse
at
king
ranch
the
lawgiver
now
rides
on
the
box
with
mr
sargent
monday
i
slept
well
last
night
in
spite
of
the
numerous
which
surrounded
us
making
a
most
dismal
noise
the
jew
was
ill
again
but
both
mr
sargent
and
the
judge
were
very
kind
to
him
so
also
was
who
declared
that
a
person
incapable
of
protecting
himself
and
sickly
such
as
this
little
jew
is
always
sure
of
kind
treatment
and
compassion
even
from
the
wildest
texans
we
started
at
and
had
to
get
through
some
dreadful
mud
mr
sargent
in
an
awful
bad
humour
and
using
terrific
language
we
were
much
delayed
by
this
unfortunate
rain
which
had
converted
a
good
road
into
a
quagmire
we
detected
a
rattlesnake
crawling
along
this
morning
but
there
are
not
nearly
so
many
of
them
in
this
country
as
there
used
to
be
we
halted
at
and
to
make
a
fire
for
cooking
we
set
a
alight
which
answered
very
well
but
one
big
rat
annoyed
by
our
proceedings
emerged
hastily
from
his
den
and
very
nearly
jumped
into
the
two
texan
rangers
belonging
to
taylor
regiment
rode
up
to
us
whilst
we
were
at
breakfast
these
rangers
all
wear
the
most
enormous
spurs
i
ever
saw
we
resumed
our
journey
at
and
reached
a
creek
called
agua
dulce
at
and
i
got
out
before
crossing
to
forage
at
some
huts
close
by
we
got
two
dozen
eggs
and
some
lard
but
on
returning
to
the
road
we
found
that
mr
sargent
had
pursued
his
usual
plan
of
leaving
us
in
the
lurch
i
luckily
was
able
to
get
hold
of
a
mexican
boy
and
rode
across
the
creek
dismounted
a
negro
and
so
got
over
we
halted
at
after
dark
crossed
the
prairie
to
visit
some
friends
who
were
encamped
half
a
mile
distant
he
lost
his
way
in
returning
and
wandered
about
for
several
hours
the
judge
with
great
presence
of
mind
kept
the
fire
up
and
he
found
us
at
last
the
heat
from
nine
to
two
is
pretty
severe
but
in
texas
there
is
generally
a
cool
which
makes
it
bearable
all
streams
or
rivers
are
called
creeks
and
pronounced
criks
tuesday
we
started
at
and
reached
a
hamlet
called
casa
blanca
at
we
procured
a
kid
some
indian
corn
and
two
fowls
in
this
neighbourhood
we
had
now
quitted
the
flat
country
and
entered
an
undulating
or
rolling
country
full
of
live
oaks
of
very
respectable
size
and
we
had
also
got
out
of
the
mud
mr
sargent
and
the
judge
got
drunk
again
about
which
however
had
a
beneficial
effect
upon
the
speed
we
descended
the
hills
at
a
terrific
pace
or
as
mr
sargent
expressed
it
like
h
ll
tan
we
nooned
it
at
a
small
creek
and
after
unhitching
mr
sargent
and
the
judge
had
a
row
with
one
another
after
which
mr
sargent
killed
and
cooked
the
goat
using
my
knife
for
these
operations
with
all
his
faults
he
certainly
is
a
capital
butcher
cook
and
he
takes
great
care
of
his
animals
and
is
careful
to
inform
us
that
the
increased
pace
we
have
been
going
at
is
not
attributable
to
gin
he
was
very
complimentary
to
me
because
i
acted
as
assistant
cook
and
butcher
mr
ward
party
passed
us
about
the
front
wheels
of
his
buggy
having
now
smashed
it
is
hitched
in
rear
of
one
of
the
waggons
we
made
a
pretty
good
afternoon
drive
through
a
wood
of
post
oaks
where
we
saw
another
rattlesnake
which
we
tried
to
shoot
we
halted
at
spring
creek
at
water
rather
brackish
and
no
grass
for
the
mules
the
judge
gave
us
some
of
his
experiences
as
a
filibuster
he
declares
that
a
polecat
is
as
good
to
eat
as
a
pig
and
that
stewed
rattlesnake
is
not
so
bad
as
might
be
supposed
the
texans
call
the
mexicans
greasers
the
latter
retort
by
the
name
gringo
we
are
now
living
luxuriously
upon
eggs
and
goat
flesh
and
i
think
we
have
made
about
miles
wednesday
we
got
under
weigh
at
the
mules
looking
rather
mean
for
want
of
grass
at
we
reached
the
nueces
river
the
banks
of
which
are
very
steep
and
are
bordered
with
a
beautiful
belt
of
live
covered
with
mustang
grapes
on
the
other
side
of
the
nueces
is
oakville
a
miserable
settlement
consisting
of
about
twenty
wooden
huts
we
bought
some
butter
there
and
caught
up
ward
waggons
the
women
at
oakville
were
most
anxious
to
buy
snuff
it
appears
that
the
texan
females
are
in
the
habit
of
dipping
snuff
which
means
putting
it
into
their
mouths
instead
of
their
noses
they
rub
it
against
their
teeth
with
a
blunted
stick
we
reached
grass
about
and
nooned
it
the
weather
being
very
trying
very
sultry
without
sun
or
wind
we
hitched
in
at
ward
waggons
in
our
front
and
a
team
in
our
rear
at
we
reached
the
weedy
a
creek
which
to
our
sorrow
was
perfectly
dry
we
drove
on
till
and
halted
at
some
good
grass
there
being
a
report
of
water
in
the
neighbourhood
mr
sargent
the
judge
ward
and
the
frenchman
started
to
explore
and
when
at
length
they
did
discover
a
wretched
little
it
appears
that
a
desperate
conflict
for
the
water
ensued
for
the
judge
returned
to
us
a
mass
of
mud
and
presenting
a
very
crestfallen
appearance
shortly
after
mr
sargent
appeared
in
such
a
bad
humour
that
he
declined
to
cook
to
eat
to
drink
or
do
anything
but
swear
vehemently
deprived
by
this
contretemps
of
our
goat
flesh
we
had
recourse
to
an
old
ham
and
very
stale
bread
we
met
many
cotton
trains
and
government
waggons
and
i
think
we
have
progressed
about
miles
thursday
the
wily
mr
sargent
drove
the
animals
down
to
the
in
the
middle
of
last
night
and
so
stole
a
march
upon
ward
our
goat
flesh
having
spoiled
had
to
be
thrown
away
this
morning
we
started
at
and
reached
rocky
at
but
before
this
two
of
ward
horses
had
which
completely
restored
our
driver
rocky
consists
of
two
huts
in
the
midst
of
a
stony
country
and
about
a
mile
beyond
it
we
reached
a
pond
watered
our
mules
and
filled
our
barrels
the
water
was
very
muddy
to
look
at
but
not
bad
to
drink
the
mules
were
lazy
and
mr
sargent
was
forced
to
fill
his
bucket
with
stones
and
pelt
the
leaders
occasionally
at
we
reached
an
open
undulating
prairie
and
halted
at
mr
sargent
and
i
killed
and
cooked
the
two
chickens
he
has
done
me
the
honour
to
call
me
a
right
good
companion
for
the
road
he
also
told
me
that
at
one
time
he
kept
a
hotel
at
el
paso
a
sort
of
house
on
the
overland
route
to
california
and
was
rapidly
making
his
fortune
when
the
war
totally
ruined
him
this
accounts
for
his
animosity
to
uncle
abe
we
hitched
in
again
at
and
after
pushing
through
some
deepish
sand
we
halted
for
the
night
only
miles
from
san
antonio
no
corn
or
water
but
plenty
of
grass
our
food
also
was
now
entirely
expended
mr
ward
struggled
up
at
making
a
desperate
effort
to
keep
up
with
us
and
this
rivalry
between
sargent
and
him
was
of
great
service
this
was
our
last
night
of
camping
out
and
i
felt
almost
sorry
for
it
for
i
have
enjoyed
the
journey
in
spite
of
the
hardships
the
country
through
which
i
have
passed
would
be
most
fertile
and
productive
at
least
the
last
miles
were
it
not
for
the
great
irregularity
of
the
seasons
sometimes
there
is
hardly
any
rain
for
two
and
three
years
together
general
longstreet
remembered
both
sargent
and
the
judge
perfectly
and
he
was
much
amused
by
my
experiences
with
these
worthies
general
longstreet
had
been
quartered
on
the
texan
frontiers
a
long
time
when
he
was
in
the
old
august
friday
we
made
a
start
at
and
with
the
assistance
of
we
managed
to
lose
our
way
but
at
a
loud
cheer
from
the
box
of
hoorraw
for
h
ll
who
afraid
of
fire
proclaimed
that
mr
sargent
had
come
in
sight
of
grey
ranch
after
buying
some
eggs
and
indian
corn
there
we
crossed
the
deep
bed
of
the
river
san
antonio
its
banks
are
very
steep
and
picturesque
we
halted
immediately
beyond
to
allow
the
mules
to
feed
for
an
hour
a
woman
was
murdered
at
a
ranch
close
by
some
time
ago
and
five
bad
characters
were
put
to
death
at
san
antonio
by
the
vigilance
committee
on
suspicion
we
crossed
the
selado
river
at
and
nooned
it
in
its
neighbourhood
mr
sargent
and
the
judge
finished
the
gin
and
the
former
being
rather
drunk
entertained
us
with
a
detailed
description
of
his
treatment
of
a
refractory
negro
girl
which
by
his
own
account
must
have
been
very
severe
was
much
disgusted
at
the
story
after
bathing
in
the
selado
mr
sargent
being
determined
to
beat
ward
pushed
on
for
san
antonio
and
we
drew
up
before
menger
hotel
at
our
mules
dead
beat
our
driver
having
fulfilled
his
promise
of
making
his
horses
howl
later
in
the
day
i
walked
through
the
streets
with
to
his
store
which
is
a
very
large
building
but
now
desolate
everything
having
been
sold
off
he
was
of
course
greeted
by
his
numerous
friends
and
amongst
others
i
saw
a
negro
come
up
to
him
shake
hands
and
welcome
him
back
i
was
introduced
to
colonel
duff
brother
who
is
also
a
very
man
but
he
has
not
thrown
off
his
british
nationality
and
become
a
citizen
the
distance
from
brownsville
to
san
antonio
is
miles
and
we
have
been
days
and
hours
however
happy
and
well
off
the
slaves
may
be
as
a
general
rule
yet
there
must
be
many
instances
like
that
of
mr
sargent
of
and
cruelty
mr
sargent
is
a
northerner
by
birth
and
is
without
any
of
the
kind
feeling
which
is
nearly
always
felt
by
southerners
for
july
saturday
san
antonio
is
prettily
situated
on
both
banks
of
the
river
of
the
same
name
it
should
contain
about
inhabitants
and
is
the
largest
place
in
texas
except
galveston
the
houses
are
well
built
of
stone
and
they
are
generally
only
one
or
two
storeys
high
all
have
verandahs
in
front
before
the
war
san
antonio
was
very
prosperous
and
rapidly
increasing
in
size
but
trade
is
now
almost
at
a
complete
all
the
male
population
under
forty
are
in
the
military
service
and
many
necessary
articles
are
at
famine
prices
coffee
costs
a
lb
menger
hotel
is
a
large
and
imposing
edifice
but
its
proprietor
a
civil
german
was
on
the
point
of
shutting
it
up
for
the
present
during
the
morning
i
visited
colonel
bankhead
a
tall
gentlemanlike
virginian
who
was
commanding
officer
of
the
troops
here
he
told
me
a
great
deal
about
the
texan
history
the
jesuit
missions
and
the
louisiana
purchase
and
he
alarmed
me
by
doubting
whether
i
should
be
able
to
cross
the
mississippi
if
banks
had
taken
alexandria
i
also
made
the
acquaintance
of
major
minter
another
virginian
who
told
me
he
had
served
in
the
cavalry
in
the
old
united
states
army
the
following
officers
in
the
confederate
army
were
in
the

hardee
general
kirby
smith
and
general

by
the
advice
of
i
sent
my
portmanteau
and
some
of
my
heavy
things
to
be
sold
by
auction
as
i
could
not
possibly
carry
them
with
me
i
took
my
place
by
the
stage
for
alleyton
houston
it
cost
in
old
times
it
was
i
dined
with
and
young
duff
at
the
latter
would
not
hear
of
my
paying
my
share
of
the
expenses
of
the
journey
from
brownsville
mrs
was
thrown
into
a
great
state
of
agitation
and
delight
by
receiving
a
letter
from
her
mother
who
is
in
yankeedom
texas
is
so
cut
off
that
she
only
hears
once
in
many
months
colonel
and
mrs
bankhead
called
for
me
in
their
ambulance
at
and
they
drove
me
to
see
the
source
of
the
san
antonio
which
is
the
most
beautiful
clear
spring
i
ever
saw
we
also
saw
the
extensive
foundations
for
a
tannery
now
being
built
by
the
confederate
government
the
country
is
very
pretty
and
is
irrigated
in
an
ingenious
manner
by
ditches
cut
from
the
river
in
all
directions
it
is
thus
in
a
great
degree
rendered
independent
of
rain
at
san
antonio
spring
we
were
entertained
by
a
major
young
a
queer
little
naval
officer
why
a
major
i
could
discover
mrs
bankhead
is
a
violent
southerner
she
was
twice
ordered
out
of
memphis
by
the
federals
on
account
of
her
husband
principles
but
she
says
that
she
was
treated
with
courtesy
and
kindness
by
the
federal
general
sherman
who
carried
out
the
orders
of
his
government
with
regret
none
of
the
southern
people
with
whom
i
have
spoken
entertain
any
hopes
of
a
speedy
termination
of
the
war
they
say
it
must
last
all
presidency
and
perhaps
a
good
deal
longer
in
the
neighbourhood
of
san
antonio
of
the
population
is
german
and
many
of
them
were
at
first
by
no
means
loyal
to
the
confederate
cause
they
objected
much
to
the
conscription
and
some
even
resisted
by
force
of
arms
but
these
were
soon
settled
by
regiment
and
it
is
said
they
are
now
reconciled
to
the
new
regime
my
portmanteau
with
what
was
in
it
for
i
gave
away
part
of
my
things
sold
for
its
value
in
england
could
have
been
more
than
or
the
portmanteau
itself
which
was
an
old
one
fetched
a
very
old
pair
of
butcher
boots
five
shirts
an
old
overcoat
also
the
federal
generals
thomas
and
stoneman
sunday
at
drove
me
in
his
buggy
to
see
the
san
pedro
spring
which
is
inferior
in
beauty
to
the
san
antonio
spring
a
troop
of
texan
cavalry
was
bivouacked
there
we
afterwards
drove
to
the
of
san
josé
and
san
juan
six
and
nine
miles
from
the
town
these
were
fortified
convents
for
the
conversion
of
the
indians
and
were
built
by
the
jesuits
about
one
hundred
and
seventy
years
ago
they
are
now
ruins
and
the
architecture
is
of
the
heavy
castilian
style
elaborately
ornamented
these
missions
are
very
interesting
and
there
are
two
more
of
them
which
i
did
not
see
in
the
afternoon
i
saw
many
negroes
and
negresses
parading
about
in
their
sunday
clothes
silks
and
crinolines
much
smarter
than
their
mistresses
at
i
dined
with
colonel
bankhead
who
gave
an
entertainment
which
in
these
hard
times
must
have
cost
a
mint
of
money
about
fourteen
of
the
principal
officers
were
invited
one
of
them
was
captain
mason
cousin
to
the
london
commissioner
who
had
served
under
stonewall
jackson
in
virginia
he
said
that
officer
was
by
no
means
popular
i
spent
a
very
agreeable
evening
and
heard
many
anecdotes
of
the
war
one
of
the
officers
sang
the
abolition
song
john
brown
together
with
its
parody
i
bound
to
be
a
soldier
in
the
army
of
the
south
a
confederate
and
another
parody
which
is
a
yankee
we
hang
jeff
davis
on
a
tree
whenever
i
have
dined
with
confederate
officers
they
have
nearly
always
proposed
the
queen
health
and
never
failed
to
pass
the
highest
eulogiums
upon
her
majesty
monday
colonel
bankhead
has
given
me
letters
of
introduction
to
general
bragg
to
general
leonidas
polk
and
several
others
at
i
called
on
mrs
bankhead
to
say
she
told
me
that
her
husband
had
two
brothers
in
the
northern
service
one
in
the
army
and
the
other
in
the
navy
the
two
army
brothers
were
both
in
the
battles
of
shiloh
and
perryville
on
opposite
sides
the
naval
bankhead
commanded
the
monitor
when
she
sank
introduced
me
to
a
german
militia
general
in
a
this
afternoon
these
two
had
a
slight
dispute
as
the
latter
spoke
strongly
in
disapproval
of
or
night
the
recent
escapade
of
captain
peñaloso
seems
to
have
been
much
condemned
in
san
antonio
this
individual
formerly
a
butcher
hanged
one
of
his
soldiers
a
short
time
ago
on
his
own
responsibility
for
desertion
and
stealing
a
musket
this
event
came
off
at
noon
in
the
principal
plaça
of
the
city
the
tree
has
been
cut
down
to
show
the
feelings
of
the
citizens
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
enforcement
of
the
conscription
has
as
a
general
rule
been
extremely
easy
throughout
the
confederacy
except
among
the
germans
but
i
hear
of
many
persons
evading
it
by
getting
into
some
sort
of
government
employment
such
as
contractors
agents
or
teamsters
to
the
rio
grande
to
my
extreme
regret
i
took
leave
of
my
friend
this
evening
whose
hospitality
and
kindness
i
shall
never
forget
i
left
san
antonio
by
for
alleyton
at
the
stage
was
an
old
coach
into
the
interior
of
which
nine
persons
were
crammed
on
three
transverse
seats
besides
many
others
on
the
roof
i
was
placed
on
the
centre
seat
which
was
extremely
narrow
and
i
had
nothing
but
a
strap
to
support
my
back
an
enormously
fat
german
was
my
and
a
confederate
officer
was
in
my
rear
our
first
team
consisted
of
four
mules
we
afterwards
got
horses
my
were
all
either
military
men
or
connected
with
the
government
out
of
nine
chewed
tobacco
during
the
night
but
they
aimed
at
the
windows
with
great
accuracy
and
did
me
the
amount
of
sleep
i
got
however
was
naturally
very
trifling
tuesday
we
crossed
the
river
guadalupe
at
and
got
a
change
of
horses
we
got
a
very
fair
breakfast
at
seguin
at
which
was
beginning
to
be
a
little
place
when
the
war
dried
it
up
it
commenced
to
rain
at
seguin
which
made
the
road
very
woolly
and
annoyed
the
outsiders
a
good
deal
the
conversation
turned
a
good
deal
upon
military
subjects
and
all
agreed
that
the
system
of
election
of
officers
had
proved
to
be
a
great
mistake
according
to
their
own
accounts
discipline
must
have
been
extremely
lax
at
first
but
was
now
improving
they
were
most
anxious
to
hear
what
was
thought
of
their
cause
in
europe
and
none
of
them
seemed
aware
of
the
great
sympathy
which
their
gallantry
and
determination
had
gained
for
them
in
england
in
spite
of
slavery
we
dined
at
a
little
wooden
hamlet
called
belmont
and
changed
horses
again
there
the
country
through
which
we
had
been
travelling
was
a
good
deal
cultivated
and
there
were
numerous
farms
i
saw
for
the
first
time
we
amused
ourselves
by
taking
shots
with
our
revolvers
at
the
enormous
which
came
to
stare
at
the
coach
in
the
afternoon
became
universal
and
the
spitting
was
sometimes
a
little
wild
it
was
the
custom
for
the
outsiders
to
sit
round
the
top
of
the
carriage
with
their
legs
dangling
over
like
mutes
on
a
hearse
returning
from
a
funeral
this
practice
rendered
it
dangerous
to
put
one
head
out
of
the
window
for
fear
of
a
back
kick
from
the
heels
or
of
a
shower
of
from
the
mouths
of
the
southern
chivalry
on
the
roof
in
spite
of
their
peculiar
habits
of
hanging
shooting
which
seemed
to
be
natural
to
people
living
in
a
wild
and
country
there
was
much
to
like
in
my
they
all
had
a
sort
of
honesty
and
straightforwardness
a
natural
courtesy
and
extreme
which
was
very
agreeable
although
they
were
all
very
anxious
to
talk
to
a
european
who
in
these
blockaded
times
is
a
yet
their
inquisitiveness
was
never
offensive
or
disagreeable
any
doubts
as
to
my
personal
safety
which
may
have
been
roused
by
my
early
insight
into
lynch
law
were
soon
completely
set
at
rest
for
i
soon
perceived
that
if
any
one
were
to
annoy
me
the
remainder
would
stand
by
me
as
a
point
of
honour
we
supped
at
a
little
town
called
gonzales
at
we
left
it
at
in
another
coach
with
six
horses
big
strong
animals
the
roads
being
all
natural
ones
were
much
injured
by
the
rains
we
were
all
rather
disgusted
by
the
bad
news
we
heard
at
gonzales
of
the
continued
advance
of
banks
and
of
the
probable
fall
of
alexandria
the
squeezing
was
really
quite
awful
but
i
did
not
suffer
so
much
as
the
fat
or
ones
they
all
bore
their
trials
in
the
most
jovial
manner
my
fat
in
despair
changed
places
with
me
my
two
being
rather
thinner
than
his
and
i
benefited
much
by
the
change
into
a
back
seat
wednesday
exhausted
as
i
was
i
managed
to
sleep
wonderfully
well
last
night
we
breakfasted
at
a
place
called
hallettsville
at
and
changed
carriages
again
here
we
took
in
four
more
confederate
soldiers
as
outsiders
and
we
were
now
eighteen
in
all
nowhere
but
in
this
country
would
such
a
thing
be
permitted
owing
to
the
great
the
coach
swayed
about
like
a
ship
in
a
heavy
sea
and
the
escapes
of
a
capsize
were
almost
miraculous
it
is
said
that
at
the
end
of
a
texan
journey
the
question
asked
is
not
have
you
been
upset
but
how
many
times
have
you
been
upset
the
value
of
the
negroes
working
in
the
fields
was
constantly
appraised
by
my
and
it
appeared
that
in
texas
an
male
fetched
whilst
a
seamstress
was
worth
two
of
my
companions
served
through
the
late
severe
campaign
in
new
mexico
but
they
considered
hours
in
a
stage
a
greater
hardship
than
any
of
their
military
experiences
we
passed
many
and
beautiful
indian
corn
but
much
of
the
latter
had
been
damaged
by
the
hail
i
was
told
that
of
the
land
formerly
devoted
to
cotton
is
still
sown
with
that
article
the
remainder
being
corn
we
also
passed
through
some
very
pretty
country
full
of
fine
and
cotton
trees
and
we
met
many
mexican
some
of
the
waggons
with
fourteen
oxen
or
twelve
mules
which
were
being
cruelly
by
their
drivers
we
crossed
several
rivers
with
steep
and
difficult
banks
and
dined
at
a
farmhouse
at
i
have
already
discovered
that
directly
the
bell
rings
it
is
necessary
to
rush
at
one
food
and
bolt
it
as
quickly
as
possible
without
any
ceremony
or
delay
otherwise
it
all
disappears
so
rapacious
and
so
voracious
are
the
natives
at
their
meals
whilst
travelling
dinner
on
such
occasions
in
no
case
lasts
more
than
seven
minutes
we
reached
columbus
at
and
got
rid
of
half
our
passengers
there
these
texan
towns
generally
consist
of
one
large
plaça
with
a
courthouse
on
one
side
and
a
hotel
opposite
the
other
two
sides
being
filled
up
with
wooden
stores
all
their
budding
prosperity
has
been
completely
checked
by
the
war
but
every
one
anticipates
a
great
immigration
into
texas
after
the
peace
we
crossed
the
colorado
river
and
reached
alleyton
our
destination
at
this
little
wooden
village
has
sprung
into
existence
during
the
last
three
years
owing
to
its
being
the
present
terminus
to
the
railroad
it
was
crammed
full
of
travellers
and
cotton
speculators
but
as
an
especial
favour
the
fat
german
and
i
were
given
a
bed
i
threw
myself
on
the
bed
with
my
clothes
on
and
was
fast
asleep
in
five
minutes
in
the
same
room
there
were
three
other
beds
each
with
two
occupants
the
distance
from
san
antonio
to
alleyton
is
miles
time
hours
it
is
only
in
texas
that
so
much
cotton
is
still
grown
thursday
i
have
acquired
my
first
experience
of
texan
railroads
in
this
country
where
every
white
man
is
as
good
as
another
by
theory
and
every
white
female
is
by
courtesy
a
lady
there
is
only
one
class
the
train
from
alleyton
consisted
of
two
long
cars
each
holding
about
fifty
persons
their
interior
is
like
the
aisle
of
a
church
twelve
seats
on
either
side
each
for
two
persons
the
seats
are
comfortably
stuffed
and
seemed
luxurious
after
the
stage
before
starting
the
engine
gives
two
preliminary
snorts
which
with
a
yell
from
the
official
of
warn
the
passengers
to
hold
on
for
they
are
closely
followed
by
a
tremendous
jerk
which
sets
the
cars
in
motion
every
passenger
is
allowed
to
use
his
own
discretion
about
breaking
his
arm
neck
or
leg
without
interference
by
the
railway
officials
people
are
continually
jumping
on
and
off
whilst
the
train
is
in
motion
and
larking
from
one
car
to
the
other
there
is
no
sort
of
fence
or
other
obstacle
to
prevent
humans
or
cattle
from
getting
on
the
line
we
left
alleyton
at
and
got
a
miserable
meal
at
richmond
at
at
this
little
town
i
was
introduced
to
a
man
in
rusty
black
clothes
and
a
hat
this
was
judge
stockdale
who
will
probably
be
the
next
governor
of
texas
he
is
an
agreeable
man
and
his
conversation
is
far
superior
to
his
clothing
the
rival
candidate
is
general
chambers
i
think
who
has
become
very
popular
by
the
following
sentence
in
his
manifesto
i
am
of
opinion
that
married
soldiers
should
be
given
the
opportunity
of
embracing
their
families
at
least
once
their
places
in
the
ranks
being
taken
by
unmarried
men
the
population
must
not
be
allowed
to
suffer
richmond
is
on
the
brazos
river
which
is
crossed
in
a
peculiar
manner
a
steep
inclined
plane
leads
to
a
low
rickety
trestle
bridge
and
a
similar
inclined
plane
is
cut
in
the
opposite
bank
the
engine
cracks
on
all
steam
and
gets
sufficient
impetus
in
going
down
the
first
incline
to
shoot
across
the
bridge
and
up
the
second
incline
but
even
in
texas
this
method
of
crossing
a
river
is
considered
rather
unsafe
after
crossing
the
river
in
this
manner
the
rail
traverses
some
very
fertile
land
part
of
which
forms
the
estate
of
the
late
colonel
terry
there
are
more
than
two
hundred
negroes
on
the
plantation
some
of
the
fields
were
planted
with
cotton
and
indian
corn
mixed
three
rows
of
the
former
between
two
of
the
latter
i
saw
also
fields
with
cotton
and
sugar
mixed
we
changed
carriages
at
harrisburg
and
i
completed
my
journey
to
houston
on
a
cotton
truck
the
country
near
houston
is
very
pretty
and
is
studded
with
white
wooden
villas
which
are
raised
off
the
ground
on
blocks
like
haystacks
i
reached
houston
at
and
drove
to
the
fannin
house
hotel
houston
is
a
much
better
place
than
i
expected
the
main
street
can
boast
of
many
brick
and
iron
houses
it
was
very
full
as
it
now
contained
all
the
refugees
from
the
deserted
town
of
galveston
after
an
extremely
mild
supper
i
was
introduced
to
lieutenant
lee
a
wounded
hero
who
lost
his
leg
at
shiloh
also
to
colonel
pyron
a
distinguished
officer
who
commands
the
regiment
named
after
him
the
fat
german
mr
lee
and
myself
went
to
the
theatre
afterwards
as
a
great
favour
my
british
prejudices
were
respected
and
i
was
allowed
a
bed
to
myself
but
the
four
other
beds
in
the
room
had
two
occupants
each
a
captain
whose
acquaintance
i
had
made
in
the
cars
slept
in
the
next
bed
to
me
directly
after
we
had
got
into
bed
a
negro
came
in
who
squatting
down
between
our
beds
began
to
clean
our
boots
the
southerner
pointed
at
the
slave
and
thus
held
forth
well
kernel
i
reckon
you
got
servants
in
your
country
but
not
of
that
colour
now
sir
this
is
a
real
african
he
as
happy
as
the
day
long
and
if
he
was
on
a
sugar
plantation
he
be
dancing
half
the
night
but
if
you
was
to
collect
a
thousand
of
them
together
and
fire
one
bomb
in
amongst
them
they
all
run
like
h
ll
the
negro
grinned
and
seemed
quite
flattered
friday
i
called
on
general
scurry
and
found
him
suffering
from
severe
ophthalmia
when
i
presented
general
magruder
letter
he
insisted
that
i
should
come
and
live
with
him
so
long
as
i
remained
here
he
also
telegraphed
to
galveston
for
a
steamer
to
take
me
there
and
back
we
dined
at
the
party
consisted
of
colonel
and
judge
terrill
a
clever
and
agreeable
man
colonel
pyron
captain
wharton
major
watkins
a
handsome
fellow
and
hero
of
the
sabine
pass
affair
and
colonel
cook
commanding
the
artillery
at
galveston
late
of
the
navy
who
enjoys
the
reputation
of
being
a
zealous
methodist
preacher
and
a
daring
officer
the
latter
told
me
he
could
hardly
understand
how
i
could
be
an
englishman
as
i
pronounced
my
h
all
right
general
scurry
himself
is
very
amusing
and
is
an
admirable
mimic
his
numerous
anecdotes
of
the
war
were
very
interesting
in
peace
times
he
is
a
lawyer
he
was
a
volunteer
major
in
the
mexican
war
and
distinguished
himself
very
much
in
the
late
campaigns
in
new
mexico
and
arizona
and
at
the
recapture
of
galveston
after
dinner
the
queen
health
was
proposed
and
the
party
expressed
the
greatest
admiration
for
her
majesty
and
respect
for
the
british
constitution
they
all
said
that
universal
suffrage
did
not
produce
such
deplorable
results
in
the
south
as
in
the
north
because
the
population
in
the
south
is
so
very
scattered
and
the
whites
being
the
superior
race
they
form
a
sort
of
aristocracy
they
all
wanted
me
to
put
off
going
to
galveston
till
monday
in
order
that
some
ladies
might
go
but
i
was
inexorable
as
it
must
now
be
my
object
to
cross
the
mississippi
without
delay
all
these
officers
despised
sabres
and
considered
and
revolvers
the
best
arms
for
cavalry
saturday
as
the
steamer
had
not
arrived
in
the
morning
i
left
by
railroad
for
galveston
general
scurry
insisted
upon
sending
his
servant
to
wait
upon
me
in
order
that
i
might
become
acquainted
with
an
aristocratic
negro
john
was
a
very
smart
fellow
and
at
first
sight
nearly
as
white
as
myself
in
the
cars
i
was
introduced
to
general
samuel
houston
the
founder
of
texan
independence
he
told
me
he
was
born
in
virginia
seventy
years
ago
that
he
was
united
states
senator
at
thirty
and
governor
of
tennessee
at
he
emigrated
into
texas
in
headed
the
revolt
of
texas
and
defeated
the
mexicans
at
san
jacinto
in
he
then
became
president
of
the
republic
of
texas
which
he
annexed
to
the
united
states
in
as
governor
of
the
state
in
he
had
opposed
the
secession
movement
and
was
though
evidently
a
remarkable
and
clever
man
he
is
extremely
egotistical
and
vain
and
much
disappointed
at
having
to
subside
from
his
former
grandeur
the
town
of
houston
is
named
after
him
in
appearance
he
is
a
tall
handsome
old
man
much
given
to
chewing
tobacco
and
blowing
his
nose
with
his
fingers
i
was
also
introduced
to
another
character
captain
chubb
who
told
me
he
was
a
yankee
by
birth
and
served
as
coxswain
to
the
united
states
ship
java
in
he
was
afterwards
imprisoned
at
boston
on
suspicion
of
being
engaged
in
the
slave
trade
but
he
escaped
at
the
beginning
of
this
war
he
was
captured
by
the
yankees
when
he
was
in
command
of
the
confederate
states
steamer
royal
yacht
and
taken
to
new
york
in
chains
where
he
was
condemned
to
be
hung
as
a
pirate
but
he
was
eventually
exchanged
i
was
afterwards
told
that
the
escapade
of
which
he
was
accused
consisted
in
his
having
hired
a
coloured
crew
at
boston
and
then
coolly
them
at
galveston
at
we
arrived
at
virginia
point
a
at
the
extremity
of
the
main
land
here
bates
battalion
was
encamped
called
also
the
swamp
angels
on
account
of
the
marshy
nature
of
their
quarters
and
of
their
predatory
and
irregular
habits
the
railroad
then
traverses
a
shallow
lagoon
called
galveston
bay
on
a
two
miles
long
this
leads
to
another
on
galveston
island
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
city
is
reached
in
the
train
i
had
received
the
following
message
by
telegraph
from
colonel
debray
who
commands
at
galveston
will
fremantle
sleep
at
the
house
of
a
blockaded
rebel
i
answered
delighted
and
was
received
at
the
terminus
by
captain
foster
of
the
staff
who
conducted
me
in
an
ambulance
to
headquarters
which
were
at
the
house
of
the
roman
catholic
bishop
i
was
received
there
by
colonel
debray
and
two
very
gentlemanlike
french
priests
we
sat
down
to
dinner
at
but
were
soon
interrupted
by
an
indignant
drayman
who
came
to
complain
of
a
military
outrage
it
appeared
that
immediately
after
i
had
left
the
cars
a
texan
of
pyron
regiment
had
desired
this
drayman
to
stop
and
upon
the
latter
declining
to
do
so
the
texan
fired
five
shots
at
him
from
his
and
the
last
shot
killed
the
drayman
horse
captain
foster
who
is
a
louisianian
and
very
sarcastic
about
texas
said
that
the
regiment
would
probably
hang
the
soldier
for
being
such
a
bad
after
dinner
colonel
debray
took
me
into
the
observatory
which
commands
a
good
view
of
the
city
bay
and
gulf
galveston
is
situated
near
the
eastern
end
of
an
island
thirty
miles
long
by
three
and
a
half
wide
its
houses
are
well
built
its
streets
are
long
straight
and
shaded
with
trees
but
the
city
was
now
desolate
blockaded
and
under
military
law
most
of
the
houses
were
empty
and
bore
many
marks
of
the
fire
of
the
federal
ships
during
the
night
of
the
january
last
the
whole
of
galveston
bay
is
very
shallow
except
a
narrow
channel
of
about
a
hundred
yards
immediately
in
front
of
the
now
deserted
wharves
the
entrance
to
this
channel
is
at
the
extremity
of
the
island
and
is
defended
by
the
new
works
which
are
now
in
progress
there
it
is
also
blocked
up
with
piles
torpedoes
and
other
obstacles
the
blockaders
were
plainly
visible
about
four
miles
from
land
they
consisted
of
three
gunboats
and
an
ugly
paddle
steamer
also
two
supply
vessels
the
wreck
of
the
confederate
cotton
steamer
neptune
destroyed
in
her
attack
on
the
harriet
lane
was
close
off
one
of
the
wharves
that
of
the
westfield
blown
up
by
the
yankee
commodore
was
off
pelican
island
in
the
night
of
the
january
general
magruder
suddenly
entered
galveston
placed
his
along
the
line
of
wharves
and
unexpectedly
opened
fire
in
the
dark
upon
the
yankee
war
vessels
at
a
range
of
about
one
hundred
yards
but
so
heavy
though
badly
directed
was
the
reply
from
the
ships
that
the
had
to
be
withdrawn
the
attack
by
colonel
cook
upon
a
massachusetts
regiment
fortified
at
the
end
of
a
wharf
also
failed
and
the
confederates
thought
themselves
badly
whipped
but
after
daylight
the
fortunate
surrender
of
the
harriet
lane
to
the
cotton
boat
bayou
city
and
the
extraordinary
conduct
of
commodore
renshaw
converted
a
confederate
disaster
into
the
recapture
of
galveston
general
magruder
certainly
deserves
immense
credit
for
his
boldness
in
attacking
a
heavily
armed
naval
squadron
with
a
few
and
two
river
steamers
protected
with
cotton
bales
and
manned
with
texan
cavalry
soldiers
i
rode
with
colonel
debray
to
examine
forts
scurry
magruder
bankhead
and
point
these
works
have
been
ingeniously
designed
by
colonel
sulokowski
formerly
in
the
austrian
army
and
they
were
being
very
well
constructed
by
one
hundred
and
fifty
whites
and
six
hundred
blacks
under
that
officer
superintendence
the
blacks
being
lent
by
the
neighbouring
planters
although
the
blockaders
can
easily
approach
to
within
three
miles
of
the
works
and
although
one
shell
will
always
stampede
the
negroes
yet
they
have
not
thrown
any
for
a
long
time
colonel
debray
is
a
frenchman
and
is
a
very
good
fellow
he
told
me
that
he
emigrated
to
america
in
he
raised
a
company
in
in
which
he
was
only
a
private
he
was
next
appointed
to
the
governor
of
texas
with
the
rank
of
he
then
descended
to
a
major
of
infantry
afterwards
rose
to
a
of
cavalry
and
is
now
colonel
captain
foster
is
properly
on
magruder
staff
and
is
very
good
company
his
property
at
new
orleans
had
been
destroyed
by
the
yankees
in
the
evening
we
went
to
a
dance
given
by
colonel
manly
which
was
great
fun
i
danced
an
american
cotillon
with
mrs
manly
it
was
very
violent
exercise
and
not
the
least
like
anything
i
had
seen
before
a
gentleman
stands
by
shouting
out
the
different
figures
to
be
performed
and
every
one
obeys
his
orders
with
much
gravity
and
energy
colonel
manly
is
a
very
gentlemanlike
carolinian
the
ladies
were
pretty
and
considering
the
blockade
they
were
very
well
dressed
six
deserters
from
banks
army
arrived
here
banks
seems
to
be
advancing
steadily
and
overcoming
the
opposition
offered
by
the
handful
of
confederates
in
the
teche
country
banks
himself
is
much
despised
as
a
soldier
and
is
always
called
by
the
confederates
mr
commissary
banks
on
account
of
the
efficient
manner
in
which
he
performed
the
duties
of
that
office
for
stonewall
jackson
in
virginia
the
officer
who
is
supposed
to
command
the
advancing
federals
is
weitzel
and
he
is
acknowledged
by
all
here
to
be
an
able
man
a
good
soldier
and
well
acquainted
with
the
country
in
which
he
is
manoeuvring
he
is
reported
to
have
died
in
august
such
a
stampede
did
occur
when
the
blockaders
threw
two
or
three
shells
all
the
negroes
ran
showing
every
sign
of
great
dismay
and
two
of
them
in
their
terror
ran
into
the
sea
and
were
unfortunately
drowned
it
is
now
however
too
late
for
the
ships
to
try
this
experiment
as
some
heavy
guns
are
in
position
a
description
of
the
different
works
is
of
course
omitted
here
sunday
i
paid
a
long
visit
this
morning
to
mr
lynn
the
british
consul
who
told
me
that
he
had
great
difficulty
in
communicating
with
the
outer
world
and
had
seen
no
british
since
the
immortalité
at
i
saw
pyron
regiment
embark
for
niblitt
bluff
to
meet
banks
this
corps
is
now
dismounted
cavalry
and
the
procession
was
a
droll
one
first
came
eight
or
ten
instruments
braying
discordantly
then
an
enormous
confederate
flag
followed
by
about
four
hundred
men
moving
by
fours
dressed
in
every
variety
of
costume
and
armed
with
every
variety
of
weapon
about
sixty
had
enfield
rifles
the
remainder
carried
carbines
or
long
rifles
of
a
peculiar
and
antiquated
manufacture
none
had
swords
or
bayonets
all
had
and
the
men
were
a
fine
lot
and
i
saw
amongst
them
a
short
stout
boy
of
fourteen
who
had
served
through
the
arizona
campaign
i
saw
many
of
the
soldiers
take
off
their
hats
to
the
french
priests
who
seemed
much
respected
in
galveston
this
regiment
is
considered
down
here
to
be
a
very
good
one
and
its
colonel
is
spoken
of
as
one
of
the
bravest
officers
in
the
army
the
regiment
was
to
be
harangued
by
old
houston
before
it
embarked
in
getting
into
the
cars
to
return
to
houston
i
was
nearly
forced
to
step
over
the
dead
body
of
the
horse
shot
by
the
soldier
yesterday
and
which
the
authorities
had
not
thought
necessary
to
remove
i
got
back
to
general
scurry
house
at
houston
at
the
general
took
me
out
for
a
drive
in
his
ambulance
and
i
saw
innumerable
negroes
and
negresses
parading
about
the
streets
in
the
most
outrageously
grand
costumes
silks
satins
crinolines
hats
with
feathers
lace
mantles
forming
an
absurd
contrast
to
the
simple
dresses
of
their
mistresses
many
were
driving
about
in
their
carriages
or
riding
on
horses
which
are
often
lent
to
them
on
sunday
afternoons
all
seemed
intensely
happy
and
satisfied
with
themselves
told
me
that
old
sam
houston
lived
for
several
years
amongst
the
cherokee
indians
who
used
to
call
him
the
raven
or
the
big
drunk
he
married
an
indian
squaw
when
he
was
with
them
colonel
ives
to
the
president
has
just
arrived
from
richmond
and
he
seems
a
very
and
agreeable
man
i
have
settled
to
take
the
route
to
shrieveport
as
it
seems
doubtful
whether
alexandria
will
or
will
not
fall
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
it
was
found
very
difficult
to
raise
infantry
in
texas
as
no
texan
walks
a
yard
if
he
can
help
it
many
mounted
regiments
were
therefore
organised
and
afterwards
dismounted
monday
general
scurry
servant
john
had
been
most
attentive
since
he
had
been
told
off
to
me
i
made
him
a
present
of
my
evening
clothes
which
gratified
him
immensely
and
i
shook
hands
with
him
at
parting
which
seems
to
be
quite
the
custom
the
southern
gentlemen
are
certainly
able
to
treat
their
slaves
with
extraordinary
familiarity
and
kindness
john
told
me
that
the
general
would
let
him
buy
his
freedom
whenever
he
chose
he
is
a
barber
by
trade
and
was
earning
much
money
when
he
insisted
on
rejoining
his
master
and
going
to
the
wars
i
left
houston
by
train
for
navasoto
at
a
captain
andrews
accompanied
me
thus
far
he
was
going
with
a
troop
of
cavalry
to
impress
of
the
negroes
on
the
plantations
for
the
government
works
at
galveston
the
planters
having
been
backward
in
coming
forward
with
their
darkies
arrived
at
navasoto
miles
at
where
i
took
a
stage
for
shrieveport
miles
i
started
at
after
having
had
a
little
dispute
with
a
man
for
a
corner
seat
and
beating
him
it
was
the
same
sort
of
vehicle
as
the
san
antonio
one
eight
people
inside
during
the
night
there
was
a
thunderstorm
tuesday
we
breakfasted
at
huntsville
at
the
federal
officers
captured
in
the
harriet
lane
are
confined
in
the
penitentiary
there
and
are
not
treated
as
prisoners
of
war
this
seems
to
be
the
system
now
with
regard
to
officers
since
the
enlistment
of
negroes
by
the
northerners
my
were
mostly
elderly
planters
or
legislators
and
there
was
one
judge
from
louisiana
one
of
them
produced
a
pair
of
boots
which
had
cost
him
another
showed
me
a
common
wideawake
hat
which
had
cost
him
in
houston
i
myself
saw
an
english
regulation
infantry
sword
exposed
for
sale
for
as
the
military
element
did
not
predominate
my
companions
united
in
speaking
with
horror
of
the
depredations
committed
in
this
part
of
the
country
by
their
own
troops
on
a
line
of
march
we
passed
through
a
country
pines
and
post
oaks
the
road
bad
crossed
the
river
trinity
at
noon
and
dined
at
the
house
of
a
disreputable
looking
individual
called
a
campbellite
minister
at
the
food
consisted
almost
invariably
of
bacon
corn
bread
and
buttermilk
a
meal
costing
a
dollar
arrived
at
crockett
at
where
we
halted
for
a
few
hours
a
was
given
to
the
louisianian
judge
and
myself
the
judge
following
my
example
took
to
it
boots
and
all
remarking
as
he
did
so
to
the
attendant
negro
that
they
were
a
d
d
sight
cleaner
than
the
bed
before
reaching
crockett
we
passed
through
the
encampment
of
phillipps
regiment
of
texas
rangers
and
we
underwent
much
chaff
they
were
to
resist
banks
wednesday
we
left
all
the
passengers
at
crockett
except
the
louisianian
judge
a
government
agent
and
the
of
the
harriet
lane
which
vessel
had
been
manned
by
the
confederates
after
her
capture
but
she
had
since
been
dismantled
and
her
crew
was
being
marched
to
shrieveport
to
man
the
ironclad
missouri
which
was
being
built
there
the
food
we
get
on
the
road
is
sufficient
and
good
enough
to
support
life
it
consists
of
pork
or
bacon
bread
made
with
indian
corn
and
a
peculiar
mixture
called
confederate
coffee
made
of
rye
meal
indian
corn
or
sweet
potatoes
the
loss
of
coffee
afflicts
the
confederates
even
more
than
the
loss
of
spirits
and
they
exercise
their
ingenuity
in
devising
substitutes
which
are
not
generally
very
successful
the
same
sort
of
country
as
yesterday
large
forests
of
pines
and
and
occasional
the
trees
having
been
killed
by
cutting
a
circle
near
the
roots
at
we
took
in
four
more
passengers
one
of
them
was
a
major
to
who
hanged
mongomery
at
brownsville
he
spoke
of
the
exploit
of
his
relative
with
some
pride
he
told
me
that
his
three
brothers
had
lost
an
arm
apiece
in
the
war
we
arrived
at
rusk
at
and
spent
a
few
hours
there
but
notwithstanding
the
boasted
splendour
of
the
beds
at
the
cherokee
hotel
and
although
by
major
influence
i
got
one
to
myself
yet
i
did
not
consider
its
aspect
sufficiently
inviting
to
induce
me
to
remove
my
clothes
thursday
we
started
again
at
in
a
smaller
coach
but
luckily
with
reduced
numbers
the
louisianian
judge
who
is
also
a
legislator
a
mississippi
planter
the
boatswain
the
government
agent
and
a
captain
williams
of
the
texas
rangers
before
the
day
broke
we
reached
a
bridge
over
a
stream
called
mud
creek
which
was
in
such
a
dilapidated
condition
that
all
hands
had
to
get
out
and
cover
over
the
biggest
holes
with
planks
the
government
agent
informed
us
that
he
still
held
a
commission
as
to
the
latter
it
appears
is
a
cross
between
a
guerilla
and
a
horse
thief
and
even
by
his
account
he
seems
to
be
an
equal
adept
at
both
professions
the
accounts
of
his
forays
in
arkansas
were
highly
amusing
but
rather
strongly
seasoned
for
a
legitimate
soldier
the
judge
was
a
very
gentlemanlike
nice
old
man
both
he
and
the
were
much
knocked
up
by
the
journey
but
i
revived
the
former
with
the
last
of
the
immortalité
rum
the
latter
was
in
very
weak
health
and
does
expect
to
live
long
but
he
ardently
hoped
to
destroy
a
few
more
bluebellies
before
he
goes
under
the
mississippi
planter
had
abandoned
his
estate
near
vicksburg
and
withdrawn
with
the
remnant
of
his
slaves
into
texas
the
judge
also
had
lost
all
his
property
in
new
orleans
in
fact
every
other
man
one
meets
has
been
more
or
less
ruined
since
the
war
but
all
speak
of
their
losses
with
the
greatest
equanimity
captain
williams
was
a
tall
cadaverous
backwoodsman
who
had
lost
his
health
in
the
war
he
spoke
of
the
federal
general
rosecrans
with
great
respect
and
he
passed
the
following
high
encomium
upon
the
troops
under
rosecrans
command
they
reglar
great
big
h
llsnorters
the
same
breed
as
ourselves
they
do
want
no
running
after
they
do
they
ai
no
dutch
cavalry
you
bet
to
my
surprise
all
the
party
were
willing
to
agree
that
a
few
years
ago
most
educated
men
in
the
south
regarded
slavery
as
a
misfortune
and
not
justifiable
though
necessary
under
the
circumstances
but
the
meddling
coercive
conduct
of
the
detested
and
despised
abolitionists
had
caused
the
bonds
to
be
drawn
much
tighter
my
of
all
classes
are
much
given
to
talk
to
me
about
their
peculiar
institution
and
they
are
most
anxious
that
i
should
see
as
much
of
it
as
possible
in
order
that
i
may
be
convinced
that
it
is
not
so
bad
as
has
been
represented
and
that
they
are
not
all
legrees
although
they
do
not
attempt
to
deny
that
there
are
many
instances
of
cruelty
but
they
say
a
man
who
is
known
to
illtreat
his
negroes
is
hated
by
all
the
rest
of
the
community
they
declare
that
yankees
make
the
worst
masters
when
they
settle
in
the
south
and
all
seem
to
be
perfectly
aware
that
slavery
which
they
did
not
invent
but
which
they
inherited
from
us
english
is
and
always
will
be
the
great
bar
to
the
sympathy
of
the
civilised
world
i
have
heard
these
words
used
over
and
over
again
all
the
villages
through
which
we
passed
were
deserted
except
by
women
and
very
old
men
their
aspect
was
most
melancholy
the
country
is
sandy
and
the
land
not
fertile
but
the
timber
is
fine
we
met
several
planters
on
the
road
who
with
their
families
and
negroes
were
taking
refuge
in
texas
after
having
abandoned
their
plantations
in
louisiana
on
the
approach
of
banks
one
of
them
had
as
many
as
sixty
slaves
with
him
of
all
ages
and
sizes
at
we
received
an
unwelcome
addition
to
our
party
in
the
shape
of
three
huge
unwashed
odoriferous
texan
soldiers
and
we
passed
a
wretched
night
in
consequence
the
texans
are
certainly
not
prone
to
take
offence
where
they
see
none
is
intended
for
when
this
irruption
took
place
i
could
help
remarking
to
the
judge
with
regard
to
the
most
obnoxious
man
who
was
occupying
the
centre
seat
to
our
mutual
discomfort
i
say
judge
this
gentleman
has
got
the
longest
legs
i
ever
saw
has
he
replied
the
judge
and
he
has
got
the
d
dest
longest
hardest
back
i
ever
felt
the
texan
was
highly
amused
by
these
remarks
upon
his
personal
appearance
and
apologised
for
his
peculiarities
crossed
the
sabine
river
at
the
union
soldiers
are
called
bluebellies
on
account
of
their
blue
uniforms
these
often
call
the
confederates
greybacks
german
dragoons
much
despised
by
the
texans
on
account
of
their
style
of
riding
friday
we
reached
marshall
at
and
got
four
sleep
there
we
then
got
into
a
railroad
for
sixteen
miles
after
which
we
were
crammed
into
another
stage
crossed
the
frontier
into
louisiana
at
i
have
therefore
been
nearly
a
month
getting
through
the
single
state
of
texas
reached
shrieveport
at
and
after
washing
for
the
first
time
in
five
days
i
called
on
general
kirby
smith
who
commands
the
whole
country
on
this
side
of
the
mississippi
he
is
a
floridian
by
birth
was
educated
at
west
point
and
served
in
the
united
states
cavalry
he
is
only
years
old
and
he
owes
his
rapid
rise
to
a
to
the
fortunate
fact
of
his
having
fallen
just
at
the
very
nick
of
time
upon
the
yankee
flank
at
the
first
battle
of
manassas
he
is
a
remarkably
active
man
and
of
very
agreeable
manners
he
wears
big
spectacles
and
a
black
beard
his
wife
is
an
extremely
pretty
woman
from
baltimore
but
she
had
cut
her
hair
quite
short
like
a
man
in
the
evening
she
proposed
that
we
should
go
down
to
the
river
and
fish
for
we
did
so
and
were
most
successful
the
general
displaying
much
energy
on
the
occasion
he
told
me
that
might
probably
have
destroyed
the
southern
army
with
the
greatest
ease
during
the
first
winter
and
without
running
much
risk
to
himself
as
the
southerners
were
so
much
by
their
easy
triumph
at
manassas
and
their
army
had
dwindled
away
i
was
introduced
to
governor
moore
of
louisiana
to
the
hyams
and
also
to
the
exiled
governor
of
missouri
reynolds
governor
moore
told
me
he
had
been
on
the
red
river
since
from
which
date
until
it
had
been
very
unhealthy
he
thinks
that
dickens
must
have
intended
shrieveport
by
eden
governor
reynolds
of
missouri
told
me
he
found
himself
in
the
unfortunate
condition
of
a
potentate
exiled
from
his
dominions
but
he
showed
me
an
address
which
he
had
issued
to
his
missourians
promising
to
be
with
them
at
the
head
of
an
army
to
deliver
them
from
their
oppressors
shrieveport
is
rather
a
place
on
the
red
river
it
contains
about
inhabitants
and
is
at
present
the
seat
of
the
louisianian
legislature
baton
rouge
but
only
members
of
the
lower
house
had
arrived
as
yet
and
business
could
not
be
commenced
with
less
than
fifty
the
river
now
is
broad
and
rapid
and
it
is
navigated
by
large
steamers
its
banks
are
low
and
very
fertile
but
reputed
to
be
very
unhealthy
general
kirby
smith
advised
me
to
go
to
munroe
and
try
to
cross
the
mississippi
from
thence
he
was
so
uncertain
as
to
alexandria
that
he
was
afraid
to
send
a
steamer
so
far
i
heard
much
talk
at
his
house
about
the
late
federal
raid
into
mississippi
which
seems
to
be
a
copy
of
john
morgan
operations
except
that
the
federal
raid
was
made
in
a
thinly
populated
country
bereft
of
its
male
inhabitants
called
by
the
yankees
bull
run
i
believe
this
is
a
mistake
of
governor
moore
i
have
always
understood
cairo
was
eden
grierson
raid
saturday
started
again
by
stage
for
munroe
at
my
companions
were
the
mississippi
planter
a
mad
dentist
from
new
orleans
called
by
courtesy
doctor
an
old
man
from
matagorda
buying
slaves
cheap
in
louisiana
a
wounded
officer
and
a
wounded
soldier
the
soldier
was
a
very
intelligent
young
missourian
who
told
me
as
others
have
that
at
the
commencement
of
these
troubles
both
he
and
his
family
were
strong
unionists
but
the
lincolnites
by
using
coercion
had
forced
them
to
take
one
side
or
the
other
and
there
are
now
no
more
bitter
secessionists
than
these
people
this
soldier
mr
douglas
was
on
his
way
to
rejoin
bragg
army
a
confederate
soldier
when
wounded
is
not
given
his
discharge
but
is
employed
at
such
work
as
he
is
competent
to
perform
mr
douglas
was
quite
lame
but
will
be
employed
at
mounted
duties
or
at
writing
we
passed
several
large
and
fertile
plantations
the
negro
quarters
formed
little
villages
and
seemed
comfortable
some
of
them
held
or
hands
we
afterwards
drove
through
some
beautiful
pine
forests
and
were
ferried
across
a
beautiful
shallow
lake
full
of
cypresses
but
not
the
least
like
european
cypress
trees
we
met
a
number
more
planters
driving
their
families
their
slaves
and
furniture
towards
texas
in
fact
everything
that
they
could
save
from
the
ruin
that
had
befallen
them
on
the
approach
of
the
federal
troops
at
we
reached
a
charming
little
town
called
mindon
where
i
met
an
english
mechanic
who
deplored
to
me
that
he
had
been
such
a
fool
as
to
naturalise
himself
as
he
was
in
hourly
dread
of
the
conscription
i
have
at
length
become
quite
callous
to
many
of
the
horrors
of
stage
travelling
i
no
longer
shrink
at
every
random
shower
of
nor
do
i
shudder
when
offered
a
quid
i
eat
voraciously
of
the
bacon
that
is
provided
for
my
sustenance
and
i
am
invariably
treated
by
my
of
all
grades
with
the
greatest
consideration
and
kindness
sometimes
a
man
remarks
that
it
is
rather
mean
of
england
not
to
recognise
the
south
but
i
can
always
shut
him
up
by
saying
that
a
nation
which
deserves
its
independence
should
fight
and
earn
it
for
itself
a
sentiment
which
is
invariably
agreed
to
by
all
sunday
i
spent
a
very
rough
night
in
consequence
of
the
badness
of
the
road
the
jolting
of
the
carriage
and
having
to
occupy
a
centre
seat
in
the
morning
we
received
news
from
every
one
we
met
of
the
fall
of
alexandria
the
road
was
alive
with
negroes
who
are
being
run
into
texas
out
of
banks
way
we
must
have
met
hundreds
of
them
and
many
families
of
planters
who
were
much
to
be
pitied
especially
the
ladies
on
approaching
munroe
we
passed
through
the
camp
of
walker
division
strong
which
was
on
its
march
from
arkansas
to
meet
banks
the
division
had
embarked
in
steamers
and
had
already
started
down
the
wachita
towards
the
red
river
when
the
news
arrived
of
the
fall
of
alexandria
and
of
the
presence
of
federal
gunboats
in
or
near
the
wachita
itself
this
caused
the
precipitate
return
and
disembarkation
of
walker
division
the
men
were
well
armed
with
rifles
and
bayonets
but
they
were
dressed
in
ragged
civilian
clothes
the
old
matagorda
man
recognised
his
son
in
one
of
these
regiments
a
perfect
boy
munroe
is
on
the
wachita
pronounced
washtaw
which
is
a
very
pretty
and
wide
stream
after
crossing
it
we
arrived
at
the
hotel
after
dark
universal
confusion
reigned
there
it
was
full
of
officers
and
soldiers
of
walker
division
and
no
person
would
take
the
slightest
notice
of
us
in
desperation
i
called
on
general
hebert
who
commanded
the
post
i
told
him
who
i
was
and
gave
him
a
letter
of
introduction
which
i
had
fortunately
brought
from
kirby
smith
i
stated
my
hard
case
and
besought
an
asylum
for
the
night
which
he
immediately
accorded
me
in
his
own
house
the
difficulty
of
crossing
the
mississippi
appeared
to
increase
the
nearer
i
got
to
it
and
general
hebert
told
me
that
it
was
very
doubtful
whether
i
could
cross
at
all
at
this
point
the
yankee
gunboats
which
had
forced
their
way
past
vicksburg
and
port
hudson
were
roaming
about
the
mississippi
and
red
river
and
some
of
them
were
reported
at
the
entrance
of
the
wachita
itself
a
small
fort
at
harrisonburg
being
the
only
impediment
to
their
appearance
in
front
of
munroe
on
another
side
the
enemy
forces
were
close
to
delhi
only
forty
miles
distant
there
were
forty
or
fifty
yankee
deserters
here
from
the
army
besieging
vicksburg
these
yankee
deserters
on
being
asked
their
reasons
for
deserting
generally
reply
our
government
has
broken
faith
with
us
we
enlisted
to
fight
for
the
union
and
not
to
liberate
the
g
d
d
d
niggers
vicksburg
is
distant
from
this
place
about
eighty
miles
the
news
of
general
lee
victory
at
chancellorsville
had
just
arrived
here
every
one
received
it
very
coolly
and
seemed
to
take
it
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
but
the
wound
of
stonewall
jackson
was
universally
deplored
monday
general
hebert
is
a
creole
he
was
a
and
served
in
the
old
army
but
afterwards
became
a
wealthy
he
used
to
hold
magruder
position
as
in
texas
but
he
has
now
been
shelved
at
munroe
where
he
expects
to
be
taken
prisoner
any
day
and
from
the
present
gloomy
aspect
of
affairs
about
here
it
seems
extremely
probable
that
he
will
not
be
disappointed
in
his
expectations
he
is
extremely
down
upon
england
for
not
recognising
the
south
he
gave
me
a
passage
down
the
river
in
a
steamer
which
was
to
try
to
take
provisions
to
harrisonburg
but
at
the
same
time
he
informed
me
that
she
might
very
probably
be
captured
by
a
yankee
gunboat
at
i
embarked
for
harrisonburg
which
is
distant
from
munroe
by
water
miles
and
by
land
miles
it
is
fortified
and
offers
what
was
considered
a
weak
obstruction
to
the
passage
of
the
gunboats
up
the
river
to
munroe
the
steamer
was
one
of
the
curious
american
river
boats
which
rise
to
a
tremendous
height
out
of
the
water
like
great
wooden
castles
she
was
steered
from
a
box
at
the
very
top
of
all
and
this
particular
one
was
propelled
by
one
wheel
at
her
stern
the
river
is
quite
beautiful
it
is
from
to
yards
broad
very
deep
and
tortuous
and
the
large
trees
grow
right
down
to
the
very
edge
of
the
water
our
captain
at
starting
expressed
in
very
plain
terms
his
extreme
disgust
at
the
expedition
and
said
he
fully
expected
to
run
against
a
gunboat
at
any
turn
of
the
river
soon
after
leaving
munroe
we
passed
a
large
plantation
the
negro
quarters
were
larger
than
a
great
many
texan
towns
and
they
held
three
hundred
hands
after
we
had
proceeded
about
half
an
hour
we
were
stopped
by
a
mounted
orderly
called
a
courier
who
from
the
bank
roared
out
the
pleasing
information
they
at
harrisonburg
the
captain
on
hearing
this
turned
quite
green
in
the
face
and
remarked
that
he
be
dogged
if
he
liked
running
into
the
jaws
of
a
lion
and
he
proposed
to
turn
back
but
he
was
jeered
at
by
my
who
were
all
either
officers
or
soldiers
wishing
to
cross
the
mississippi
to
rejoin
their
regiments
in
the
different
confederate
armies
one
pleasant
fellow
more
warlike
than
the
rest
suggested
that
as
we
had
some
enfields
on
board
we
should
make
a
little
bit
of
a
fight
or
at
least
make
one
butt
at
a
gunboat
i
was
relieved
to
find
that
these
insane
proposals
were
not
received
with
any
enthusiasm
by
the
majority
the
plantations
as
we
went
further
down
the
river
looked
very
prosperous
but
signs
of
preparations
for
immediate
skedaddling
were
visible
in
most
of
them
and
i
fear
they
are
all
destined
to
be
soon
desolate
and
destroyed
we
came
to
a
courier
picket
every
sixteen
miles
at
one
of
them
we
got
the
information
drove
back
at
which
there
was
great
rejoicing
and
the
captain
recovering
his
spirits
became
quite
jocose
and
volunteered
to
give
me
letters
of
introduction
to
a
particular
friend
of
his
about
here
called
mr
farragut
but
the
next
news
still
caused
us
to
tie
ourselves
to
a
tree
at
off
a
little
village
called
columbia
which
is
between
munroe
and
harrisonburg
we
then
lit
a
large
fire
round
which
all
the
passengers
squatted
on
their
heels
in
texan
fashion
each
man
whittling
a
piece
of
wood
and
discussing
the
merits
of
the
different
yankee
prisons
at
new
orleans
or
chicago
one
of
them
seeing
me
called
out
i
reckon
kernel
if
the
yankees
catch
you
with
us
they
say
you
in
d
d
bad
company
which
sally
caused
universal
hilarity
the
descendants
of
the
french
colonists
in
louisiana
are
called
creoles
most
of
them
talk
french
and
i
have
often
met
louisianian
regiments
talking
that
language
general
hebert
is
the
only
man
of
education
i
met
in
the
whole
of
my
travels
who
spoke
disagreeably
about
england
in
this
respect
most
people
say
they
think
we
are
quite
right
to
keep
out
of
it
as
long
as
we
can
but
others
think
our
government
is
foolish
to
miss
such
a
splendid
chance
of
smashing
the
yankees
with
whom
we
must
have
a
row
sooner
or
later
tuesday
shortly
after
daylight
three
negroes
arrived
from
harrisonburg
and
they
described
the
fight
as
still
going
on
they
said
they
were
dreadful
skeered
and
one
of
them
told
me
he
would
rather
be
a
slave
to
his
master
all
his
life
than
a
white
man
and
a
soldier
during
the
morning
some
of
the
officers
and
soldiers
left
the
boat
and
determined
to
cut
across
country
to
harrisonburg
but
i
would
not
abandon
the
scanty
remains
of
my
baggage
until
i
was
forced
to
do
so
during
the
morning
twelve
more
negroes
arrived
from
harrisonburg
it
appears
that
three
hundred
of
them
the
property
of
neighbouring
planters
had
been
engaged
working
on
the
fortifications
but
they
all
with
one
accord
bolted
when
the
first
shell
was
fired
their
only
idea
and
hope
at
present
seemed
to
be
to
get
back
to
their
masters
all
spoke
of
the
yankees
with
great
detestation
and
expressed
wishes
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
bad
people
our
captain
coolly
employed
them
in
tearing
down
the
fences
and
carrying
the
wood
away
on
board
the
steamer
for
firewood
we
did
nothing
but
this
all
day
long
the
captain
being
afraid
to
go
on
and
unwilling
to
return
in
the
evening
a
new
alarm
seized
him
that
the
federal
cavalry
had
cut
off
the
confederate
line
of
couriers
during
the
night
we
remained
in
the
same
position
as
last
night
head
up
stream
and
ready
to
be
off
at
a
moment
notice
one
of
the
passengers
on
board
this
steamer
was
captain
barney
of
the
confederate
states
navy
who
has
since
i
believe
succeeded
captain
maffit
in
the
command
of
the
florida
wednesday
there
was
a
row
on
board
last
night
one
of
the
officers
having
been
too
attentive
to
a
lady
had
to
skedaddle
suddenly
into
the
woods
in
order
to
escape
the
fury
of
her
protector
and
he
has
not
thought
it
advisable
to
reappear
my
trusty
companion
for
several
days
the
poor
young
missourian
was
taken
ill
and
told
me
he
had
a
smart
little
on
him
i
doctored
him
with
some
of
the
physic
which
mr
maloney
had
given
me
and
he
got
better
in
the
evening
we
had
pickets
out
in
the
woods
last
night
two
of
my
on
that
duty
fell
in
with
a
negro
and
pretending
they
were
yankees
asked
him
to
join
them
he
consented
and
even
volunteered
to
steal
his
master
horses
and
he
then
received
a
tremendous
thrashing
administered
by
the
two
soldiers
with
their
ramrods
at
to
the
surprise
of
all
the
captain
suddenly
made
up
his
mind
to
descend
the
river
at
all
hazards
thinking
i
suppose
that
anything
was
better
than
the
uncertainty
of
the
last
hours
the
further
we
went
the
more
beautiful
was
the
scenery
at
we
were
assured
by
a
citizen
on
the
bank
that
the
gunboats
really
had
retreated
and
at
our
doubts
were
set
at
rest
to
our
great
satisfaction
by
descrying
the
confederate
flag
flying
from
fort
beauregard
high
above
the
little
town
of
harrisonburg
after
we
had
landed
i
presented
my
letter
of
introduction
from
general
hebert
to
colonel
logan
who
commands
the
fort
he
introduced
me
to
a
german
officer
the
engineer
they
gave
me
an
account
of
the
attack
and
repulse
of
the
four
federal
gunboats
under
commodore
woodford
and
supposed
to
have
been
the
pittsburg
ironclad
the
general
price
the
arizona
and
another
fort
beauregard
is
a
much
more
formidable
looking
work
than
i
expected
to
see
and
its
strength
had
evidently
been
much
underrated
at
munroe
a
hill
feet
high
which
rises
just
in
rear
of
harrisonburg
has
been
scarped
and
fortified
it
is
situated
at
an
angle
of
the
river
and
faces
a
long
reach
of
two
miles
the
gunboats
after
demanding
an
unconditional
surrender
which
was
treated
with
great
contempt
by
colonel
logan
opened
fire
at
on
sunday
and
kept
it
up
till
throwing
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
and
inch
shell
the
gunboats
reopened
again
for
about
an
hour
on
monday
afternoon
when
they
finally
withdrew
the
arizona
being
crippled
the
fort
fired
altogether
about
shot
smooth
bore
the
range
was
about
a
mile
the
garrison
thought
that
they
had
loosened
several
of
the
they
felt
confident
they
could
have
sunk
the
wooden
vessels
if
they
had
attempted
to
force
the
passage
and
they
were
naturally
much
elated
with
their
success
which
certainly
had
not
been
anticipated
on
board
my
steamer
or
at
munroe
i
had
not
time
to
visit
the
interior
of
the
fort
but
i
saw
the
effect
of
the
shell
upon
the
outside
those
which
fell
in
the
sand
did
not
burst
only
three
men
were
wounded
in
the
garrison
they
told
me
the
deck
of
the
pittsburg
was
furnished
with
a
parapet
of
cotton
bales
for
riflemen
the
river
at
harrisonburg
is
about
yards
broad
and
very
deep
with
a
moderate
current
the
town
being
between
the
vessels
and
the
fort
had
of
course
suffered
considerably
during
the
bombardment
when
the
works
are
complete
they
will
be
much
more
formidable
to
our
great
joy
colonel
logan
decided
that
our
vessel
should
proceed
at
once
to
trinity
which
is
fifteen
miles
nearer
natchez
on
the
mississippi
than
harrisonburg
we
arrived
there
at
and
found
that
the
gunboats
had
only
just
left
after
having
destroyed
all
the
molasses
and
rum
they
could
find
and
carried
away
a
few
negroes
six
of
us
pigged
in
one
very
small
room
paying
a
dollar
each
for
this
luxury
to
an
old
woman
who
was
most
inhospitable
and
told
us
she
did
want
to
see
no
soldiers
as
the
yanks
would
come
back
and
burn
her
house
for
harbouring
rebels
i
am
always
taken
for
a
confederate
officer
partly
from
being
in
their
company
and
partly
on
account
of
my
clothes
which
happen
to
be
a
grey
almost
the
same
colour
as
most
of
the
soldiers
coats
thursday
the
officers
and
soldiers
about
thirty
in
number
who
came
down
the
wachita
in
my
company
determined
to
proceed
to
natchez
and
a
very
hard
day
work
we
had
of
it
as
the
louisianian
bank
of
the
mississippi
is
completely
overflowed
at
this
time
of
year
and
the
river
itself
is
infested
with
the
gunboats
which
have
run
past
vicksburg
and
port
hudson
the
passage
can
only
be
made
by
a
tedious
journey
in
small
boats
through
the
swamps
and
bayous
our
party
left
trinity
at
in
one
big
yawl
and
three
skiffs
in
my
skiff
were
eight
persons
besides
a
negro
oarsman
named
tucker
we
had
to
take
it
in
turns
to
row
with
this
worthy
and
i
soon
discovered
to
my
cost
the
inconvenience
of
sitting
in
close
proximity
with
a
perspiring
darkie
this
negro
was
a
very
powerful
man
very
vain
and
susceptible
of
flattery
i
won
his
heart
by
asking
him
if
he
worth
dollars
we
kept
him
up
to
the
mark
throughout
the
journey
by
plying
him
with
compliments
upon
his
strength
and
skill
one
officer
declared
to
him
that
he
should
try
to
marry
his
mistress
a
widow
on
purpose
to
own
him
after
beating
up
for
about
eight
miles
against
one
of
three
streams
which
unite
at
and
give
its
name
to
trinity
we
turned
off
to
the
right
and
got
into
a
large
dense
swamp
the
thicket
was
so
tangled
and
impenetrable
that
we
experienced
the
greatest
difficulty
in
forcing
our
way
through
it
we
were
often
obliged
to
get
into
the
water
up
to
our
middles
and
shove
whilst
most
of
the
party
walked
along
an
embankment
after
two
hours
and
a
half
of
this
sort
of
work
we
had
to
carry
our
boats
bodily
over
the
embankment
into
a
bayou
called
log
bayou
on
account
of
the
numerous
floating
logs
which
had
to
be
encountered
we
then
crossed
a
large
and
beautiful
lake
which
led
us
into
another
dismal
swamp
quite
as
tangled
as
the
former
one
here
we
lost
our
way
and
got
aground
several
times
but
at
length
after
great
exertions
we
forced
ourselves
through
it
and
reached
lake
concordia
a
fine
piece
of
water
several
miles
in
extent
and
we
were
landed
at
dusk
on
the
plantation
of
a
mr
davis
these
bayous
and
swamps
abound
with
alligators
and
snakes
of
the
most
venomous
description
i
saw
many
of
the
latter
swimming
about
exposed
to
a
heavy
fire
of
but
the
alligators
were
frightened
away
by
the
leading
boat
the
yawl
and
one
of
the
skiffs
beat
us
and
their
passengers
reached
natchez
about
but
the
other
skiff
which
could
not
boast
of
a
tucker
was
lost
in
the
swamp
and
passed
the
night
there
in
a
wretched
plight
the
weather
was
most
disagreeable
either
a
burning
sun
or
a
downpour
of
rain
the
distance
we
did
in
the
skiff
was
about
miles
which
took
us
eleven
hours
to
perform
on
landing
we
hired
at
mr
davis
a
small
cart
for
mr
douglas
the
wounded
missourian
and
our
baggage
and
we
had
to
finish
the
day
by
a
trudge
of
three
miles
through
deep
mud
until
at
length
we
reached
a
place
called
vidalia
which
is
on
the
louisianian
bank
of
the
mississippi
just
opposite
natchez
at
vidalia
i
got
the
immense
luxury
of
a
pretty
good
bed
to
which
enabled
me
to
take
off
my
clothes
and
boots
for
the
first
time
in
ten
days
the
landlord
told
us
that
three
of
the
enemy
gunboats
had
passed
during
the
day
and
as
he
said
their
crews
were
often
in
the
habit
of
landing
at
vidalia
he
cautioned
the
military
to
be
ready
to
bolt
into
the
woods
at
any
time
during
the
night
there
were
two
conscripts
on
board
my
skiff
one
an
irishman
and
the
other
a
pole
they
confessed
to
me
privately
their
extreme
dislike
of
the
military
profession
but
at
the
same
time
they
acknowledged
the
enthusiasm
of
the
masses
for
the
war
friday
i
nearly
slept
round
the
clock
after
exertions
mr
douglas
and
i
crossed
the
father
of
rivers
and
landed
on
the
mississippi
bank
at
natchez
is
a
pretty
little
town
and
ought
to
contain
about
inhabitants
it
is
built
on
the
top
of
a
high
bluff
overlooking
the
mississippi
river
which
is
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
broad
at
this
point
when
i
reached
natchez
i
hired
a
carriage
and
with
a
letter
of
introduction
which
i
had
brought
from
san
antonio
i
drove
to
the
house
of
mr
haller
nutt
distant
from
the
town
about
two
miles
the
scenery
about
natchez
is
extremely
pretty
and
the
ground
is
hilly
with
plenty
of
fine
trees
mr
nutt
place
reminded
me
very
much
of
an
english
gentleman
country
seat
except
that
the
house
itself
is
rather
like
a
pagoda
but
it
is
beautifully
furnished
mr
nutt
was
extremely
civil
and
was
most
anxious
that
i
should
remain
at
natchez
for
a
few
days
but
now
that
i
was
thoroughly
wound
up
for
travelling
i
determined
to
push
on
to
vicksburg
as
all
the
late
news
seemed
to
show
that
some
great
operations
must
take
place
there
before
long
i
had
fondly
imagined
that
after
reaching
natchez
my
difficulties
would
have
been
over
but
i
very
soon
discovered
that
this
was
a
delusive
hope
i
found
that
natchez
was
full
of
the
most
gloomy
rumours
another
yankee
raid
seemed
to
have
been
made
into
the
interior
of
mississippi
more
railroad
is
reported
to
be
destroyed
and
great
doubts
were
expressed
whether
i
should
be
able
to
get
into
vicksburg
at
all
however
as
i
found
some
other
people
as
determined
to
proceed
as
myself
we
hired
a
carriage
for
to
drive
to
brookhaven
which
is
the
nearest
point
on
the
railroad
and
is
distant
from
natchez
miles
my
companions
were
a
fat
government
contractor
from
texas
the
wounded
missourian
mr
douglas
and
an
ugly
woman
wife
to
a
soldier
in
vicksburg
we
left
natchez
at
noon
and
were
driven
by
a
negro
named
nelson
the
carriage
and
the
three
horses
belong
to
him
and
he
drives
it
for
his
own
profit
but
he
is
nevertheless
a
slave
and
pays
his
owner
to
be
allowed
to
work
on
his
own
account
he
was
quite
as
vain
as
and
even
more
amusing
than
tucker
he
said
he
did
want
to
see
no
yanks
nor
to
be
no
freer
than
he
is
and
he
thought
the
war
had
already
lasted
four
or
five
years
every
traveller
we
met
on
the
road
was
eagerly
asked
the
questions
are
the
yanks
in
brookhaven
is
the
railroad
open
at
first
we
received
satisfactory
replies
but
at
we
met
an
officer
driving
towards
natchez
at
a
great
pace
he
gave
us
the
alarming
intelligence
that
was
going
to
be
evacuated
now
as
jackson
is
the
capital
city
of
this
state
a
great
railroad
junction
and
on
the
highroad
to
every
civilised
place
from
this
our
feelings
may
be
imagined
but
we
did
not
believe
it
possible
on
the
other
hand
we
were
told
that
general
joseph
johnston
had
arrived
and
assumed
the
command
in
mississippi
he
appears
to
be
an
officer
in
whom
every
one
places
unbounded
confidence
we
slept
at
a
farmhouse
all
the
males
were
absent
at
the
war
and
it
is
impossible
to
exaggerate
the
unfortunate
condition
of
the
women
left
behind
in
these
farmhouses
they
have
scarcely
any
clothes
and
nothing
but
the
coarsest
bacon
to
eat
and
are
in
miserable
uncertainty
as
to
the
fate
of
their
relations
whom
they
can
hardly
ever
communicate
with
their
slaves
however
generally
remain
true
to
them
our
hostess
though
she
was
reduced
to
the
greatest
distress
was
and
exceedingly
well
educated
very
far
superior
to
a
woman
of
her
station
in
england
saturday
we
started
a
little
before
daylight
our
team
looking
so
very
mean
that
we
expressed
doubts
as
to
their
lasting
to
mr
nelson
great
indignation
we
breakfasted
at
another
little
farmhouse
on
some
unusually
tough
bacon
and
coffee
made
of
sweet
potatoes
the
natives
under
all
their
misery
were
in
favour
of
fighting
for
independence
to
the
last
and
i
constantly
hear
the
words
this
is
the
most
unjust
war
ever
waged
upon
a
people
by
mortal
man
at
we
met
a
great
crowd
of
negroes
who
had
been
run
into
the
swamps
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
the
yankees
and
they
were
now
returning
to
louisiana
at
a
wounded
soldier
gave
us
the
deplorable
information
that
the
enemy
really
was
on
the
railroad
between
jackson
and
brookhaven
and
that
jackson
itself
was
in
his
hands
this
news
staggered
us
all
and
nelson
became
alarmed
for
the
safety
of
his
wretched
animals
but
we
all
determined
to
go
on
at
all
hazards
and
see
what
turned
up
we
halted
for
dinner
at
a
farmhouse
in
which
were
seven
virgins
seated
all
of
a
row
they
were
all
but
shy
and
bashful
to
a
degree
i
never
before
witnessed
all
the
young
women
in
this
country
seem
to
be
either
uncommonly
or
else
extremely
shy
the
further
we
went
the
more
certain
became
the
news
of
the
fall
of
jackson
we
passed
the
night
in
the
verandah
of
an
old
farmer
he
told
us
that
grierson
yankee
raid
had
captured
him
about
three
weeks
ago
he
thought
the
yankees
were
about
strong
they
took
all
good
horses
leaving
their
ones
behind
they
destroyed
railroad
government
property
and
arms
and
paroled
all
men
both
old
and
young
but
they
committed
no
barbarities
in
this
manner
they
traversed
all
the
state
of
mississippi
without
meeting
any
resistance
they
were
fine
looking
men
from
the
states
sunday
we
started
again
at
and
met
five
wounded
men
who
had
been
captured
and
paroled
by
banks
in
louisiana
they
confirmed
everything
about
the
fall
of
jackson
which
made
me
consider
myself
particularly
unfortunate
and
destined
apparently
to
be
always
intercepted
by
the
northern
troops
which
had
happened
to
me
at
alexandria
at
harrisonburg
and
now
again
at
jackson
at
we
reached
the
little
town
of
brookhaven
which
was
full
of
travellers
principally
confederate
soldiers
anxious
to
rejoin
their
regiments
maxey
brigade
left
this
place
by
road
last
night
to
join
general
johnston
who
is
supposed
to
be
concentrating
his
forces
at
a
place
called
canton
not
far
from
jackson
i
called
on
captain
matthews
the
officer
who
commanded
at
brookhaven
and
after
introducing
myself
to
him
he
promised
to
assist
me
by
every
means
in
his
power
to
join
general
johnston
i
then
went
to
a
methodist
chapel
a
good
many
soldiers
were
there
and
great
number
of
women
at
noon
just
as
i
had
begun
to
get
in
very
low
spirits
about
the
prospects
of
getting
on
a
locomotive
arrived
from
a
station
called
haslehurst
and
brought
us
the
astonishing
report
that
the
yankees
had
suddenly
abandoned
jackson
after
destroying
all
the
government
and
a
good
deal
of
private
property
this
news
caused
our
prospects
to
look
brighter
monday
on
getting
up
this
morning
everything
appeared
very
uncertain
and
a
thousand
contradictory
reports
and
rumours
were
flying
about
at
i
called
on
captain
matthews
and
told
him
my
earnest
desire
to
get
on
towards
johnston
army
at
all
risks
he
kindly
introduced
me
to
the
conductor
of
a
locomotive
who
offered
to
take
me
to
within
a
few
miles
of
jackson
if
he
was
not
cut
off
by
the
enemy
which
seemed
extremely
probable
at
i
seated
myself
in
company
with
about
twenty
soldiers
on
the
engine
and
we
started
towards
jackson
on
reaching
crystal
springs
to
jackson
we
found
general
loring
division
crossing
the
railroad
and
marching
east
it
had
been
defeated
with
the
loss
of
most
of
its
artillery
three
days
before
and
was
now
cut
off
from
general
pemberton
at
the
conductor
stopped
the
engine
and
put
us
out
at
a
spot
distant
nine
miles
from
jackson
and
as
i
could
procure
no
shelter
food
or
conveyance
there
i
found
myself
in
a
terrible
fix
at
this
juncture
a
french
boy
rode
up
on
horseback
and
volunteered
to
carry
my
saddlebags
as
far
as
jackson
if
i
could
walk
and
carry
the
remainder
gladly
accepting
this
unexpected
offer
i
started
with
him
to
walk
up
the
railroad
as
he
assured
me
the
yankees
really
had
gone
and
during
the
journey
he
gave
me
a
description
of
their
conduct
during
the
short
time
they
had
occupied
the
city
on
arriving
within
three
miles
of
jackson
i
found
the
railroad
destroyed
by
the
enemy
who
after
pulling
up
the
track
had
made
piles
of
the
sleepers
and
then
put
the
rails
in
layers
on
the
top
of
these
heaps
they
had
then
set
fire
to
the
sleepers
which
had
caused
the
rails
to
bend
when
red
hot
the
wooden
bridges
had
also
been
set
on
fire
and
were
still
smoking
when
within
a
mile
and
a
half
of
jackson
i
met
four
men
who
stopped
and
questioned
me
very
suspiciously
but
they
at
length
allowed
me
to
proceed
saying
that
these
were
curious
times
after
another
mile
i
reached
a
mild
trench
which
was
dignified
by
the
name
of
the
fortifications
of
jackson
a
small
fight
had
taken
place
there
four
days
previous
when
general
johnston
had
evacuated
the
city
when
i
got
inside
this
trench
i
came
to
the
spot
on
which
a
large
body
of
the
yankees
had
recently
been
encamped
they
had
set
fire
to
a
great
quantity
of
stores
and
arms
which
they
had
been
unable
to
carry
away
with
them
and
which
were
still
burning
and
were
partially
destroyed
i
observed
also
great
numbers
of
pikes
and
pikeheads
amongst
the
debris
at
the
entrance
to
the
town
the
french
boy
took
me
to
the
house
of
his
relatives
and
handed
me
my
saddlebags
these
french
people
told
me
they
had
been
much
notwithstanding
their
french
nationality
they
showed
me
their
broken
furniture
and
they
assured
me
that
they
had
been
robbed
of
everything
of
any
value
i
then
shouldered
my
saddlebags
and
walked
through
the
smoking
and
desolate
streets
towards
the
bowmont
house
hotel
i
had
not
proceeded
far
before
a
man
with
long
grey
hair
and
an
enormous
revolver
rode
up
to
me
and
offered
to
carry
my
saddlebags
he
then
asked
me
who
i
was
and
after
i
told
him
he
thought
a
few
moments
and
then
said
well
sir
you
must
excuse
me
but
if
you
are
a
british
officer
i
ca
make
out
what
on
earth
you
are
doing
at
jackson
just
now
i
could
not
but
confess
that
this
was
rather
a
natural
idea
and
that
my
presence
in
this
burning
town
must
have
seemed
rather
odd
more
especially
as
i
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
i
was
there
entirely
of
my
own
free
will
and
for
my
own
amusement
mr
smythe
for
so
this
individual
was
named
then
told
me
that
if
i
was
really
the
person
i
represented
myself
i
should
be
well
treated
by
all
but
that
if
i
could
not
prove
myself
to
be
an
english
officer
an
event
would
happen
which
it
was
not
difficult
to
foresee
and
the
idea
caused
a
disagreeable
sensation
about
the
throat
mr
smythe
then
gave
me
to
understand
that
i
must
remain
a
prisoner
for
the
present
he
conducted
me
to
a
room
in
the
bowmont
house
hotel
and
i
found
myself
speedily
surrounded
by
a
group
of
eager
and
excited
citizens
who
had
been
summoned
by
smythe
to
my
at
first
they
were
inclined
to
be
disagreeable
they
examined
my
clothes
and
argued
as
to
whether
they
were
of
english
manufacture
some
who
had
been
in
london
asked
me
questions
about
the
streets
of
the
metropolis
and
about
my
regiment
one
remarked
that
i
was
young
for
a
when
i
suggested
that
they
should
treat
me
with
proper
respect
until
i
was
proved
to
be
a
spy
they
replied
that
their
city
had
been
brutally
pillaged
by
the
yankees
and
that
there
were
many
suspicious
characters
about
everything
now
looked
very
threatening
and
it
became
evident
to
me
that
nothing
would
relieve
the
minds
of
these
men
so
much
as
a
hanging
match
i
looked
in
vain
for
some
one
to
take
my
part
and
i
could
not
even
get
any
person
to
examine
my
papers
at
this
critical
juncture
a
new
character
appeared
on
the
scene
in
the
shape
of
a
big
heavy
man
who
said
to
me
my
name
is
dr
russell
i
an
irishman
and
i
hate
the
british
government
and
the
english
nation
but
if
you
are
really
an
officer
in
the
coldstream
guards
there
is
nothing
i
wo
do
for
you
you
shall
come
to
my
house
and
i
will
protect
you
i
immediately
showed
dr
russell
my
passport
and
letters
of
introduction
to
general
johnston
and
other
confederate
officers
he
pronounced
them
genuine
promised
to
stand
by
me
and
wanted
to
take
me
away
with
him
at
once
but
observing
that
the
countenances
of
smythe
and
his
colleagues
did
not
by
any
means
express
satisfaction
at
this
arrangement
i
announced
my
determination
to
stay
where
i
was
until
i
was
released
by
the
military
authorities
with
whom
i
demanded
an
immediate
audience
a
very
handsome
cavalry
officer
called
captain
yerger
shortly
afterwards
arrived
who
released
me
at
once
asked
me
to
his
house
and
promised
that
i
should
join
a
brigade
which
was
to
march
for
general
johnston
camp
on
the
following
morning
all
the
citizens
seemed
to
be
satisfied
by
the
result
of
my
interview
with
captain
yerger
and
most
of
them
insisted
on
shaking
hands
and
liquoring
up
in
horrible
whisky
smythe
however
was
an
exception
to
this
rule
he
evidently
thought
he
had
effected
a
grand
capture
and
was
not
at
all
satisfied
at
the
turn
of
affairs
i
believe
to
his
dying
day
he
will
think
i
am
a
spy
but
it
was
explained
to
me
that
his
house
had
been
burnt
down
by
the
yankees
two
days
before
which
had
made
him
unusually
venomous
they
told
me
that
dr
russell
had
saved
his
property
from
pillage
in
the
following
manner
he
had
seated
himself
in
his
verandah
with
a
loaded
gun
on
his
knees
and
when
the
pillagers
approached
he
addressed
them
in
the
following
manner
no
man
can
die
more
than
once
and
i
shall
never
be
more
ready
to
die
than
i
am
now
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
your
going
into
this
house
except
that
i
shall
kill
the
first
two
of
you
who
move
with
this
gun
now
then
gentlemen
walk
in
this
speech
is
said
to
have
saved
dr
russell
from
further
annoyance
and
his
property
from
the
ruin
which
overtook
his
neighbours
jackson
the
capital
of
the
state
of
mississippi
is
a
place
of
great
importance
four
railroads
meet
here
and
have
been
destroyed
in
each
direction
for
a
distance
of
from
three
to
five
miles
all
the
numerous
factories
have
been
burnt
down
by
the
enemy
who
were
of
course
justified
in
doing
so
but
during
the
short
space
of
hours
in
which
general
grant
occupied
the
city
his
troops
had
wantonly
pillaged
nearly
all
the
private
houses
they
had
gutted
all
the
stores
and
destroyed
what
they
could
not
carry
away
all
this
must
have
been
done
under
the
very
eyes
of
general
grant
whose
name
was
in
the
book
of
the
bowmont
house
hotel
i
saw
the
ruins
of
the
roman
catholic
church
the
priest
house
and
the
principal
hotel
which
were
still
smoking
together
with
many
other
buildings
which
could
in
no
way
be
identified
with
the
confederate
government
the
whole
town
was
a
miserable
wreck
and
presented
a
deplorable
aspect
nothing
could
exceed
the
intense
hatred
and
fury
with
which
its
excited
citizens
speak
of
the
outrages
they
have
undergone
of
their
desire
for
a
bloody
revenge
and
of
their
hope
that
the
black
flag
might
be
raised
i
had
previously
heard
the
jacksonians
spoken
of
as
not
being
particularly
zealous
in
the
war
heaven
knows
general
grant
had
now
converted
them
into
good
and
earnest
rebels
at
i
called
at
captain
yerger
house
and
found
him
with
general
gist
and
another
officer
lying
flat
on
their
stomachs
poring
over
a
map
captain
yerger
then
introduced
me
to
the
ladies
of
his
family
who
were
extremely
pretty
very
amiable
and
highly
patriotic
the
house
is
charming
and
being
outside
the
town
it
had
by
good
luck
escaped
destruction
and
pillage
after
supper
the
ladies
played
and
sang
and
i
ended
an
eventful
day
in
a
very
agreeable
manner
general
gist
promised
that
i
should
accompany
his
brigade
on
its
march
towards
general
johnston
and
mrs
yerger
insisted
that
i
should
pass
the
night
at
her
house
in
this
part
of
the
country
the
prospects
of
the
confederacy
appeared
to
be
very
gloomy
general
joseph
johnston
who
commands
the
whole
western
department
only
arrived
from
tennessee
last
wednesday
and
on
the
following
day
he
found
himself
obliged
to
abandon
jackson
to
an
overwhelming
northern
army
after
making
a
short
fight
to
enable
his
baggage
to
escape
general
pemberton
who
had
hitherto
held
the
chief
command
is
abused
by
all
he
was
beaten
on
saturday
at
baker
creek
where
he
lost
the
greater
part
of
his
artillery
he
had
retired
into
vicksburg
and
was
now
completely
shut
up
there
by
the
victorious
grant
general
maxey
brigade
about
strong
was
near
brookhaven
and
was
marching
east
when
i
was
there
general
loring
force
cut
off
from
pemberton
was
near
crystal
springs
general
johnston
with
about
men
was
supposed
to
be
near
canton
general
gist
troops
about
strong
were
close
by
having
arrived
from
south
carolina
and
georgia
just
too
late
to
defend
jackson
the
enemy
under
general
grant
in
vastly
superior
force
was
pressing
vicksburg
very
hard
and
had
now
completely
invested
that
fortress
the
great
object
of
the
confederates
must
of
course
be
to
unite
their
scattered
forces
under
so
able
a
general
as
johnston
and
then
relieve
vicksburg
since
this
date
the
unfortunate
city
of
jackson
has
been
again
subjected
to
pillage
by
the
federals
after
the
capture
of
vicksburg
tuesday
the
landlord
of
the
bowmont
house
gave
a
breakfast
at
to
general
gist
and
his
staff
to
which
i
also
was
invited
shortly
afterwards
i
was
given
a
seat
in
a
curious
little
vehicle
belonging
to
lieutenant
martino
a
spaniard
in
the
confederate
army
this
vehicle
caused
considerable
merriment
amongst
the
soldiers
who
called
it
a
we
left
jackson
with
the
leading
troops
about
amidst
a
great
waving
of
handkerchiefs
and
showers
of
flowers
thrown
by
the
few
remaining
ladies
who
were
still
left
in
that
dilapidated
place
the
corps
under
general
gist
consisted
of
three
weak
brigades
the
leading
one
composed
of
georgians
and
south
carolinians
the
next
were
texans
under
general
ector
and
the
last
were
arkansians
under
general
general
gist
had
twelve
napoleon
guns
with
him
the
horses
were
fine
animals
and
were
in
wonderful
good
condition
considering
that
they
had
been
ten
days
in
the
railroad
coming
from
south
carolina
the
troops
were
roughly
but
efficiently
clothed
their
boots
were
in
good
order
and
all
were
armed
with
enfield
rifles
the
weather
was
very
hot
and
we
were
halted
to
bivouac
for
the
night
at
a
spot
about
seventeen
miles
from
jackson
on
the
road
towards
vicksburg
the
straggling
of
the
georgians
was
on
the
grandest
scale
conceivable
the
men
fell
out
by
dozens
and
seemed
to
suit
their
own
convenience
in
that
respect
without
interference
on
the
part
of
the
officers
but
i
was
told
that
these
regiments
had
never
done
any
marching
before
having
hitherto
been
quartered
in
forts
and
transported
by
railroad
the
country
is
much
covered
with
woods
and
is
sandy
with
very
little
water
i
did
not
consider
that
the
troops
were
marched
judiciously
they
were
halted
too
long
at
a
time
and
not
often
enough
the
baggage
was
carried
on
country
carts
pressed
into
the
service
we
bivouacked
in
the
woods
near
a
very
pretty
house
belonging
to
a
planter
called
colonel
robinson
these
immense
woods
make
admirable
bivouacs
general
state
rights
gist
is
a
south
carolinian
only
years
of
age
and
although
not
educated
as
a
soldier
he
seems
easily
to
have
adapted
himself
to
the
military
profession
he
looks
a
determined
man
and
he
takes
responsibility
very
coolly
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
he
was
very
doubtful
as
to
the
exact
whereabouts
of
general
johnston
but
about
noon
a
courier
arrived
from
whom
he
received
important
and
satisfactory
information
otherwise
general
gist
had
made
up
his
mind
for
some
nasty
work
before
the
junction
could
be
effected
he
told
me
that
the
present
expedition
was
rather
inconvenient
to
him
as
he
had
only
been
married
three
days
before
he
left
charleston
he
lent
me
a
magnificent
rug
and
i
slept
very
comfortably
in
the
open
air
for
the
first
time
since
i
was
in
texas
wednesday
at
we
were
awoke
by
a
great
bombardment
going
on
at
vicksburg
which
lasted
about
three
hours
the
assembly
was
beaten
at
by
an
old
nigger
performing
on
a
cracked
drum
and
its
sound
was
hailed
by
the
soldiers
with
loud
yells
general
gist
his
staff
and
i
breakfasted
with
mr
robinson
whose
house
is
charming
and
beautifully
furnished
and
had
not
been
visited
by
the
yankees
we
had
a
crazy
old
planter
named
with
us
who
insisted
upon
accompanying
the
column
mounted
on
a
miserable
animal
which
had
been
left
him
by
the
enemy
as
not
being
worth
carrying
away
the
small
remains
of
this
poor
old
man
sense
had
been
shattered
by
the
yankees
a
few
days
ago
they
cleaned
him
completely
out
taking
his
horses
mules
cows
and
pigs
and
stealing
his
clothes
and
anything
they
wanted
destroying
what
they
could
not
carry
away
but
what
riled
him
most
was
that
he
had
been
visited
by
a
federal
officer
disguised
in
the
confederate
uniform
poor
old
full
of
rebel
zeal
had
on
being
invited
to
do
so
mounted
behind
this
officer
and
unbosomed
himself
to
him
his
fury
and
rage
may
be
imagined
at
finding
himself
shortly
afterwards
in
the
very
midst
of
the
federal
camp
but
the
yankee
general
ordered
him
to
be
released
and
it
appears
that
the
reason
of
his
being
kidnapped
was
to
extract
from
him
a
large
quantity
of
gold
which
he
was
supposed
to
have
hidden
somewhere
this
mr
or
major
took
a
great
fancy
to
me
and
insisted
on
picking
some
of
the
silk
of
indian
corn
which
he
requested
i
would
present
to
queen
victoria
to
show
her
how
far
advanced
the
crops
were
in
mississippi
it
was
almost
painful
to
hear
the
manner
in
which
this
poor
old
man
gloated
over
the
bodies
of
the
dead
yankees
at
jackson
and
of
his
intense
desire
to
see
more
of
them
put
to
death
the
column
reached
the
village
or
town
of
livingston
at
where
i
was
introduced
to
a
militia
general
and
his
pretty
daughter
the
latter
had
been
married
two
days
before
to
a
wounded
confederate
officer
but
the
happy
couple
were
just
on
the
point
of
starting
for
the
yazoo
river
as
they
were
afraid
of
being
disturbed
in
their
felicity
by
the
yankees
i
now
heard
every
one
speaking
of
the
fall
of
vicksburg
as
very
possible
and
its
jeopardy
was
laid
at
the
door
of
general
pemberton
for
whom
no
language
could
be
too
strong
he
was
freely
called
a
coward
and
a
traitor
he
has
the
misfortune
to
be
a
northerner
by
birth
which
was
against
him
in
the
opinion
of
all
here
general
gist
and
i
cantered
on
in
front
of
the
column
and
reached
general
johnston
bivouac
at
general
johnston
received
me
with
much
kindness
when
i
presented
my
letters
of
introduction
and
stated
my
object
in
visiting
the
confederate
armies
in
appearance
general
joseph
johnston
commonly
called
joe
johnston
is
rather
below
the
middle
height
spare
soldierlike
and
well
set
up
his
features
are
good
and
he
has
lately
taken
to
wear
a
greyish
beard
he
is
a
virginian
by
birth
and
appears
to
be
about
years
old
he
talks
in
a
calm
deliberate
and
confident
manner
to
me
he
was
extremely
affable
but
he
certainly
possesses
the
power
of
keeping
people
at
a
distance
when
he
chooses
and
his
officers
evidently
stand
in
great
awe
of
him
he
lives
very
plainly
and
at
present
his
only
consisted
of
an
old
and
both
very
inferior
articles
there
was
only
one
fork
one
prong
deficient
between
himself
and
staff
and
this
was
handed
to
me
ceremoniously
as
the
guest
illustration
general
joseph
e
johnston
he
has
undoubtedly
acquired
the
entire
confidence
of
all
the
officers
and
soldiers
under
him
many
of
the
officers
told
me
they
did
not
consider
him
inferior
as
a
general
to
lee
or
any
one
else
he
told
me
that
vicksburg
was
certainly
in
a
critical
situation
and
was
now
closely
invested
by
grant
he
said
that
he
johnston
had
men
with
him
which
includes
gist
hardly
any
cavalry
and
only
sixteen
pieces
of
cannon
but
if
he
could
get
adequate
reinforcements
he
stated
his
intention
of
endeavouring
to
relieve
vicksburg
i
also
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
georgian
general
walker
a
fierce
and
very
warlike
who
was
furious
at
having
been
obliged
to
evacuate
jackson
after
having
only
destroyed
four
hundred
yankees
he
told
me
i
know
i
could
hold
the
place
but
i
did
want
to
kill
a
few
more
of
the
rascals
at
i
returned
with
general
gist
to
his
camp
as
my
baggage
was
there
on
the
load
we
were
met
by
several
natives
who
complained
that
soldiers
were
quartering
themselves
upon
them
and
eating
everything
the
bivouacs
are
extremely
pretty
at
night
the
dense
woods
being
lit
up
by
innumerable
camp
fires
i
afterwards
learnt
that
this
bombardment
preceded
one
of
the
unsuccessful
assaults
nearly
every
man
in
this
part
of
the
country
has
a
military
title
thursday
i
rejoined
general
johnston
at
and
was
received
into
his
mess
major
eustis
and
lieutenant
washington
officers
of
his
staff
are
thorough
gentlemen
and
did
all
in
their
power
to
make
me
comfortable
the
first
is
a
louisianian
of
wealth
formerly
his
negro
always
speaks
french
he
is
brother
to
the
secretary
of
mr
slidell
in
paris
and
has
learnt
to
become
an
excellent
staff
officer
i
was
presented
to
captain
henderson
who
commanded
a
corps
of
about
fifty
scouts
these
are
employed
on
the
hazardous
duty
of
hanging
about
the
enemy
camps
collecting
information
and
communicating
with
pemberton
in
vicksburg
they
are
a
lot
of
men
wild
and
very
picturesque
in
appearance
at
noon
a
yankee
military
surgeon
came
to
camp
he
had
been
left
behind
by
grant
to
look
after
the
yankee
wounded
at
jackson
and
he
was
now
anxious
to
rejoin
his
general
by
flag
of
truce
but
general
johnston
very
prudently
refused
to
allow
this
and
desired
that
he
should
be
sent
to
the
north
richmond
by
a
very
sensible
arrangement
both
sides
have
agreed
to
treat
doctors
as
and
not
to
make
prisoners
of
war
of
them
the
chief
surgeon
in
johnston
army
is
a
very
clever
and
amusing
kentuckian
named
dr
yandell
he
told
me
he
had
been
educated
in
england
and
might
have
had
a
large
practice
there
my
friend
major
very
kindly
took
me
to
dine
with
a
neighbouring
planter
named
harrold
at
whose
house
i
met
general
gregg
a
texan
who
with
his
brigade
fought
the
yankees
at
raymond
a
few
days
ago
after
dinner
i
asked
mr
harrold
to
take
me
over
the
quarters
of
his
slaves
which
he
did
immediately
the
huts
were
comfortable
and
very
clean
the
negroes
seemed
fond
of
their
master
but
he
told
me
they
were
suffering
dreadfully
from
the
effects
of
the
war
he
had
so
much
difficulty
in
providing
them
with
clothes
and
shoes
i
saw
an
old
woman
in
one
of
the
huts
who
had
been
suffering
from
an
incurable
disease
for
thirteen
years
and
was
utterly
useless
she
was
evidently
well
cared
for
and
was
treated
with
affection
and
care
at
all
events
she
must
have
benefited
largely
by
the
peculiar
institution
i
have
often
told
these
planters
that
i
thought
the
word
slave
was
the
most
repulsive
part
of
the
institution
and
i
have
always
observed
they
invariably
shirk
using
it
themselves
they
speak
of
their
servant
their
boy
or
their
negroes
but
never
of
their
slaves
they
address
a
negro
as
boy
or
girl
or
uncle
or
aunty
in
the
evening
i
asked
general
johnston
what
prospect
he
thought
there
was
of
early
operations
and
he
told
me
that
at
present
he
was
too
weak
to
do
any
good
and
he
was
unable
to
give
me
any
definite
idea
as
to
when
he
might
be
strong
enough
to
attack
grant
i
therefore
made
up
my
mind
to
be
off
in
a
day
or
two
unless
something
turned
up
as
i
could
not
afford
to
wait
for
events
i
have
still
so
much
to
see
general
johnston
is
a
very
man
and
agreeable
to
converse
with
he
told
me
that
he
considered
marlborough
a
greater
general
than
wellington
all
americans
have
an
intense
admiration
for
napoleon
they
seldom
scruple
to
express
their
regret
that
he
was
beaten
at
waterloo
remarking
upon
the
extreme
prevalence
of
military
titles
general
johnston
said
you
must
be
astonished
to
find
how
fond
all
americans
are
of
titles
though
they
are
republicans
and
as
they
ca
get
any
other
sort
they
all
take
military
ones
whilst
seated
round
the
camp
fire
in
the
evening
one
of
the
officers
remarked
to
me
i
can
assure
you
colonel
that
nine
men
out
of
ten
in
the
south
would
sooner
become
subjects
of
queen
victoria
than
return
to
the
union
nine
men
out
of
ten
said
general
johnston
out
of
a
hundred
i
consider
that
few
people
in
the
world
can
be
more
fortunate
in
their
government
than
the
british
colonies
of
north
america
but
the
effect
of
these
compliments
was
rather
spoilt
when
some
one
else
said
they
would
prefer
to
serve
under
the
emperor
of
the
french
or
the
emperor
of
japan
to
returning
to
the
dominion
of
uncle
abe
and
it
was
still
more
damaged
when
another
officer
alluded
in
an
undertone
to
the
infernal
regions
as
a
more
agreeable
alternative
than
reunion
with
the
yankees
friday
the
bombardment
at
vicksburg
was
very
heavy
and
continuous
this
morning
i
had
a
long
conversation
with
general
johnston
who
told
me
that
the
principal
evils
which
a
confederate
general
had
to
contend
against
consisted
in
the
difficulty
of
making
combinations
owing
to
uncertainty
about
the
time
which
the
troops
would
take
to
march
a
certain
distance
on
account
of
their
straggling
propensities
but
from
what
i
have
seen
and
heard
it
appears
to
me
that
the
confederates
possess
certain
great
qualities
as
soldiers
such
as
individual
bravery
and
natural
aptitude
in
the
use
of
firearms
strong
determined
patriotism
and
boundless
confidence
in
their
favourite
generals
and
in
themselves
they
are
sober
of
necessity
as
there
is
literally
no
liquor
to
be
got
they
have
sufficient
good
sense
to
know
that
a
certain
amount
of
discipline
is
absolutely
necessary
and
i
believe
that
instances
of
insubordination
are
extremely
rare
they
possess
the
great
advantage
of
being
led
by
men
of
talent
and
education
as
soldiers
who
thoroughly
understand
the
people
they
have
to
lead
as
well
as
those
they
have
to
beat
these
generals
such
as
lee
johnston
beauregard
or
longstreet
they
would
follow
anywhere
and
obey
implicitly
but
on
the
other
hand
many
of
their
officers
looking
forward
to
future
political
advancement
owing
to
their
present
military
rank
will
not
punish
their
men
or
are
afraid
of
making
themselves
obnoxious
by
enforcing
rigid
discipline
the
men
are
constantly
in
the
habit
of
throwing
away
their
knapsacks
and
blankets
on
a
long
march
if
not
carried
for
them
and
though
actuated
by
the
strongest
and
purest
patriotism
can
often
not
be
got
to
consider
their
obligations
as
soldiers
in
the
early
part
of
the
war
they
were
often
when
victorious
nearly
as
disorganised
as
the
beaten
and
many
would
coolly
walk
off
home
under
the
impression
that
they
had
performed
their
share
but
they
are
becoming
better
in
these
respects
as
the
war
goes
on
all
this
would
account
for
the
trifling
benefits
derived
by
the
confederates
from
their
numerous
victories
general
johnston
told
me
that
grant
had
displayed
more
vigour
than
he
had
expected
by
crossing
the
river
below
vicksburg
seizing
jackson
by
vastly
superior
force
and
after
cutting
off
communications
investing
the
fortress
thoroughly
so
as
to
take
it
if
possible
before
a
sufficient
force
could
be
got
to
relieve
it
his
army
is
estimated
at
men
and
general
johnston
has
very
little
opinion
of
the
defences
of
vicksburg
on
the
land
side
he
said
the
garrison
consisted
of
about
men
news
has
been
received
that
the
yankees
were
getting
up
the
yazoo
river
and
this
morning
general
walker
division
left
at
for
yazoo
city
the
general
with
his
staff
and
myself
rode
into
canton
six
miles
and
lodged
in
the
house
of
a
planter
who
owned
slaves
dr
yandell
is
a
wonderful
mimic
and
amused
us
much
by
taking
off
the
marriage
ceremony
as
performed
by
general
polk
in
tennessee
general
morgan
of
kentucky
notoriety
being
the
bridegroom
one
of
henderson
scouts
caused
much
hilarity
amongst
the
staff
this
afternoon
he
had
brought
in
a
yankee
prisoner
and
to
general
johnston
for
doing
so
saying
i
found
him
in
a
negro
quarter
and
surrendered
so
quick
i
could
kill
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
conduct
of
the
federals
in
captured
cities
tends
to
create
a
strong
indisposition
on
the
part
of
the
confederates
to
take
prisoners
particularly
amongst
these
wild
mississippians
general
johnston
told
me
this
evening
that
altogether
he
had
been
wounded
ten
times
he
was
the
senior
officer
of
the
old
army
who
joined
the
confederates
and
he
commanded
the
virginian
army
until
he
was
severely
wounded
at
the
battle
of
seven
pines
after
having
lived
with
the
veterans
of
bragg
and
lee
i
was
able
to
form
a
still
higher
estimate
of
confederate
soldiers
their
obedience
and
forbearance
in
success
their
discipline
under
disaster
their
patience
under
suffering
under
hardships
or
when
wounded
and
their
boundless
devotion
to
their
country
under
all
circumstances
are
beyond
all
praise
when
i
was
introduced
to
general
polk
in
tennessee
i
recognised
him
at
once
by
dr
yandell
imitation
which
was
most
wonderfully
accurate
called
fairoaks
by
the
yankees
saturday
general
johnston
major
eustis
and
myself
left
canton
at
on
a
locomotive
for
jackson
on
the
way
we
talked
a
good
deal
about
stonewall
jackson
general
johnston
said
that
although
this
extraordinary
man
did
not
possess
any
great
qualifications
as
a
strategist
and
was
perhaps
unfit
for
the
independent
command
of
a
large
army
yet
he
was
gifted
with
wonderful
courage
and
determination
and
a
perfect
faith
in
providence
that
he
was
destined
to
destroy
his
enemy
he
was
much
indebted
to
general
ewell
in
the
valley
campaigns
stonewall
jackson
was
also
most
fortunate
in
commanding
the
flower
of
the
virginian
troops
and
in
being
opposed
to
the
most
incapable
federal
commanders
such
as
fremont
and
banks
before
we
had
proceeded
twelve
miles
we
were
forced
to
stop
and
collect
wood
from
the
roadside
to
feed
our
engine
and
the
general
worked
with
so
much
energy
as
to
cause
his
seven
pines
wound
to
give
him
pain
we
were
put
out
at
a
spot
where
the
railroad
was
destroyed
at
about
four
miles
from
jackson
a
carriage
ought
to
have
been
in
waiting
for
us
but
by
some
mistake
it
had
not
arrived
so
we
had
to
foot
it
i
was
obliged
to
carry
my
heavy
saddlebags
major
eustis
very
kindly
took
my
knapsack
and
the
general
carried
the
cloaks
in
this
order
we
reached
jackson
much
exhausted
at
general
loring
came
and
reported
himself
soon
after
he
is
a
stout
man
with
one
arm
his
division
had
arrived
at
jackson
from
crystal
springs
about
strong
evans
brigade
about
had
also
arrived
from
charleston
and
maxey
brigade
was
in
the
act
of
marching
into
jackson
i
calculate
therefore
that
general
johnston
must
now
have
nearly
men
between
jackson
and
the
yazoo
i
took
an
affectionate
farewell
of
him
and
his
officers
and
he
returned
to
canton
at
i
shall
be
much
surprised
if
he
is
not
heard
of
before
long
that
portion
of
his
troops
which
i
saw
though
they
had
been
beaten
and
forced
to
retreat
were
in
excellent
spirits
full
of
confidence
and
clamouring
to
be
led
against
double
their
numbers
i
renewed
my
acquaintance
with
dr
russell
for
whose
timely
protection
i
shall
always
feel
myself
much
indebted
i
also
sent
my
love
to
smythe
by
several
different
people
at
i
left
jackson
in
a
government
ambulance
in
company
with
captain
brown
of
general
johnston
staff
who
was
extremely
useful
to
me
i
had
taken
the
precaution
of
furnishing
myself
with
a
pass
from
colonel
ewell
the
which
i
afterwards
discovered
was
absolutely
necessary
as
i
was
asked
for
it
continually
and
on
the
railroad
every
person
passport
was
rigidly
examined
we
drove
to
the
nearest
point
at
which
the
railroad
was
in
working
order
a
distance
of
nearly
five
miles
we
then
got
into
the
cars
at
for
meridian
this
piece
of
railroad
was
in
a
most
dangerous
state
and
enjoys
the
reputation
of
being
the
very
worst
of
all
the
bad
railroads
in
the
south
it
was
completely
worn
out
and
could
not
be
repaired
accidents
are
of
almost
daily
occurrence
and
a
nasty
one
had
happened
the
day
before
after
we
had
proceeded
five
miles
our
engine
ran
off
the
track
which
caused
a
stoppage
of
three
hours
all
male
passengers
had
to
get
out
to
push
along
the
cars
sunday
we
reached
meridian
at
with
sound
limbs
and
only
five
hours
late
we
left
for
mobile
at
and
arrived
there
at
this
part
of
the
line
was
in
very
good
order
we
were
delayed
a
short
time
owing
to
a
which
had
occurred
in
the
the
difficulty
was
this
the
engineer
had
shot
a
passenger
and
then
unhitched
his
engine
cut
the
telegraph
and
bolted
up
the
line
leaving
his
train
planted
on
a
single
track
he
had
allowed
our
train
to
pass
by
shunting
himself
until
we
had
done
so
without
any
suspicion
the
news
of
this
occurrence
caused
really
hardly
any
excitement
amongst
my
but
i
heard
one
man
remark
that
it
was
mighty
mean
to
leave
a
train
to
be
run
into
like
that
we
avoided
this
catastrophe
by
singular
good
fortune
the
universal
practice
of
carrying
arms
in
the
south
is
undoubtedly
the
cause
of
occasional
loss
of
life
and
is
much
to
be
regretted
but
on
the
other
hand
this
custom
renders
altercations
and
quarrels
of
very
rare
occurrence
for
people
are
naturally
careful
what
they
say
when
a
bullet
may
be
the
probable
reply
by
the
intercession
of
captain
brown
i
was
allowed
to
travel
in
the
ladies
car
it
was
cleaner
and
more
convenient
barring
the
squalling
of
the
numerous
children
who
were
terrified
into
good
behaviour
by
threats
from
their
negro
nurses
of
being
given
to
the
yankees
i
put
up
at
the
principal
hotel
at
mobile
the
battlehouse
the
living
appeared
to
be
very
good
by
comparison
and
cost
in
consequence
of
the
fabulous
value
of
boots
they
must
not
be
left
outside
the
door
of
one
room
from
danger
of
annexation
by
a
needy
and
unscrupulous
warrior
i
cut
this
out
of
a
mobile
paper
two
days
after
attempt
to
commit
we
learn
that
while
the
on
the
mobile
and
ohio
railroad
was
near
beaver
meadow
one
of
the
employees
named
thomas
fitzgerald
went
into
one
of
the
passenger
cars
and
shot
lieutenant
knowles
with
a
pistol
the
ball
entering
his
left
shoulder
going
out
at
the
back
of
his
neck
making
a
very
dangerous
wound
fitzgerald
then
uncoupled
the
locomotive
from
the
train
and
started
off
when
a
few
miles
above
beaver
meadows
he
stopped
and
cut
the
telegraph
wires
and
then
proceeded
up
the
road
when
near
lauderdale
station
he
came
in
collision
with
the
smashing
the
engine
and
doing
considerable
damage
to
several
of
the
cars
it
is
thought
he
there
took
to
the
woods
at
any
rate
he
has
made
good
his
escape
so
far
as
nothing
of
him
has
yet
been
heard
the
shooting
as
we
are
informed
was
that
of
revenge
it
will
be
remembered
that
a
few
months
ago
knowles
and
a
brother
of
thomas
fitzgerald
named
jack
had
a
renconter
at
enterprise
about
a
lady
and
during
which
knowles
killed
jack
fitzgerald
afterwards
it
is
stated
that
thomas
threatened
to
revenge
the
death
of
his
brother
so
on
sunday
morning
knowles
was
on
the
train
as
stated
going
up
to
enterprise
to
stand
his
trial
thomas
learning
that
he
was
on
the
train
hunted
him
up
and
shot
him
knowles
we
learn
is
now
lying
in
a
very
critical
condition
this
is
a
mistake
monday
i
was
disappointed
in
the
aspect
of
mobile
it
is
a
regular
rectangular
american
city
built
on
a
sandy
flat
and
covering
a
deal
of
ground
for
its
population
which
is
about
i
called
on
general
maury
for
whom
i
brought
a
letter
of
introduction
from
general
johnston
he
is
a
very
gentlemanlike
and
intelligent
but
diminutive
virginian
and
had
only
just
assumed
the
command
at
mobile
he
was
very
civil
and
took
me
in
a
steamer
to
see
the
sea
defences
we
were
accompanied
by
general
ledbetter
the
engineer
and
we
were
six
hours
visiting
the
forts
mobile
is
situated
at
the
head
of
a
bay
thirty
miles
long
the
blockading
squadron
eight
to
ten
in
number
is
stationed
outside
the
bay
the
entrance
to
which
is
defended
by
forts
morgan
and
gaines
but
as
the
channel
between
these
two
forts
is
a
mile
wide
they
might
probably
be
passed
within
two
miles
of
the
city
however
the
bay
becomes
very
shallow
and
the
ship
channel
is
both
dangerous
and
tortuous
it
is
moreover
obstructed
by
double
rows
of
pine
piles
and
all
sorts
of
ingenious
torpedos
besides
being
commanded
by
carefully
constructed
forts
armed
with
heavy
guns
and
built
either
on
islands
or
on
piles
their
names
are
fort
pinto
fort
spanish
river
apalache
and
blakeley
the
garrisons
of
these
forts
complained
of
their
being
unhealthy
and
i
did
not
doubt
the
assertion
before
landing
we
boarded
two
ironclad
the
confederate
fleet
at
mobile
is
considerable
and
reflects
great
credit
upon
the
energy
of
the
mobilians
as
it
has
been
constructed
since
the
commencement
of
the
war
during
the
trip
i
overheard
general
maury
soliloquising
over
a
yankee
flag
and
saying
well
i
never
should
have
believed
that
i
could
have
lived
to
see
the
day
in
which
i
should
detest
that
old
flag
he
is
cousin
to
lieutenant
maury
who
has
distinguished
himself
so
much
by
his
writings
on
physical
geography
especially
the
family
seems
to
be
a
very
military
one
his
brother
is
captain
of
the
confederate
steamer
georgia
after
landing
i
partook
of
a
hasty
dinner
with
general
maury
and
major
cummins
i
was
then
mounted
on
the
general
horse
and
was
sent
to
gallop
round
the
land
defences
with
slaughter
and
his
staff
by
great
good
fortune
this
was
the
evening
of
general
weekly
inspection
and
all
the
redoubts
were
manned
by
their
respective
garrisons
consisting
half
of
soldiers
and
half
of
armed
citizens
who
had
been
exempted
from
the
conscription
either
by
their
age
or
nationality
or
had
purchased
substitutes
one
of
the
forts
was
defended
by
a
burly
british
guard
commanded
by
a
venerable
captain
wheeler
after
visiting
the
fortifications
i
had
supper
at
general
house
and
met
there
some
of
the
refugees
from
new
orleans
these
are
now
being
huddled
neck
and
crop
out
of
that
city
for
refusing
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
united
states
great
numbers
of
women
and
children
are
arriving
at
mobile
every
day
they
are
in
a
destitute
condition
and
they
add
to
the
universal
feeling
of
exasperation
the
propriety
of
raising
the
black
flag
and
giving
no
quarter
was
again
freely
discussed
at
general
slaughter
and
was
evidently
the
popular
idea
i
heard
many
anecdotes
of
the
late
stonewall
jackson
who
was
general
slaughter
comrade
in
the
artillery
of
the
old
army
it
appears
that
previous
to
the
war
he
was
almost
a
monomaniac
about
his
health
when
he
left
the
service
he
was
under
the
impression
that
one
of
his
legs
was
getting
shorter
than
the
other
and
afterwards
his
idea
was
that
he
only
perspired
on
one
side
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
keep
the
arm
and
leg
of
the
other
side
in
constant
motion
in
order
to
preserve
the
circulation
but
it
seems
that
immediately
the
war
broke
out
he
never
made
any
further
allusion
to
his
health
general
slaughter
declared
that
on
the
night
after
the
terrific
repulse
of
burnside
army
at
fredericksburg
stonewall
jackson
had
made
the
following
suggestion
i
am
of
opinion
that
we
ought
to
attack
the
enemy
at
once
and
in
order
to
avoid
the
confusion
and
mistakes
so
common
in
a
i
recommend
that
we
should
all
strip
ourselves
perfectly
naked
goes
on
very
regularly
at
mobile
the
steamers
nearly
always
succeed
but
the
schooners
are
generally
captured
i
shall
start
for
the
tennessean
army
commanded
by
general
braxton
bragg
a
description
of
either
its
sea
or
land
defences
is
necessarily
omitted
its
members
were
british
subjects
exempted
from
the
conscription
but
they
had
volunteered
to
fight
in
defence
of
the
city
i
always
forgot
to
ask
general
lee
whether
this
story
was
a
true
one
tuesday
when
i
took
colonel
ewell
pass
to
the
office
this
morning
to
be
countersigned
that
official
hesitated
about
stamping
it
but
luckily
a
man
in
his
office
came
to
my
rescue
and
volunteered
to
say
that
although
he
did
know
me
himself
he
had
heard
me
spoken
of
by
others
as
a
very
respectable
gentleman
i
was
only
just
in
time
to
catch
the
twelve
steamer
for
the
montgomery
railroad
i
overheard
two
negroes
on
board
discussing
affairs
in
general
they
were
deploring
the
war
and
expressing
their
hatred
of
the
yankees
for
bringing
sufferment
on
us
as
well
as
our
masters
both
of
them
had
evidently
a
great
aversion
to
being
run
off
as
they
called
it
one
of
them
wore
his
master
sword
of
which
he
was
very
proud
and
he
strutted
about
in
a
most
amusing
and
consequential
manner
i
got
into
the
railroad
cars
at
the
pace
was
not
at
all
bad
had
we
not
stopped
so
often
and
for
such
a
long
time
for
wood
and
water
i
sat
opposite
to
a
wounded
soldier
who
told
me
he
was
an
englishman
from
chelsea
he
said
he
was
returning
to
his
regiment
although
his
wound
in
the
neck
often
gave
him
great
pain
the
spirit
with
which
wounded
men
return
to
the
front
even
although
their
wounds
are
imperfectly
healed
is
worthy
of
all
praise
and
shows
the
indomitable
determination
of
the
southern
people
in
the
same
car
there
were
several
quite
young
boys
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
who
were
badly
wounded
and
one
or
two
were
minus
arms
and
legs
of
which
deficiencies
they
were
evidently
very
vain
the
country
through
which
we
passed
was
a
dense
pine
forest
sandy
soil
and
quite
desolate
very
uninviting
to
an
invading
army
we
travelled
all
night
wednesday
arrived
at
montgomery
the
capital
of
alabama
at
daylight
and
left
it
by
another
railroad
at
all
state
capitals
appear
to
resemble
one
another
and
look
like
bits
cut
off
from
great
cities
one
or
two
streets
have
a
good
deal
of
pretension
about
them
and
the
inevitable
capitol
with
its
dome
forms
the
principal
feature
a
sentry
stands
at
the
door
of
each
railway
car
who
examines
the
papers
of
every
passenger
with
great
strictness
and
even
after
that
inspection
the
same
ceremony
is
performed
by
an
officer
of
the
department
who
accompanies
every
train
the
officers
and
soldiers
on
this
duty
are
very
civil
and
courteous
and
after
getting
over
their
astonishment
at
finding
that
i
am
a
british
officer
they
do
all
they
can
to
make
me
comfortable
they
ask
all
sorts
of
curious
questions
about
the
british
army
and
often
express
a
strong
wish
to
see
of
our
regiments
they
can
hardly
believe
that
the
coldstream
is
really
dressed
in
scarlet
they
entered
gravely
into
a
discussion
amongst
themselves
as
to
whether
british
troops
would
have
taken
the
position
at
fredericksburg
the
arguments
on
both
sides
were
very
amusing
and
opinion
was
pretty
evenly
divided
we
met
three
trains
crammed
full
of
soldiers
for
army
they
belonged
to
breckenridge
division
of
bragg
army
and
all
seemed
in
the
highest
spirits
cheering
and
yelling
like
demons
in
the
cars
i
fell
in
with
the
federal
doctor
who
was
refused
leave
to
pass
through
general
johnston
lines
he
was
now
for
richmond
he
was
in
full
yankee
uniform
but
was
treated
with
civility
by
all
the
confederate
soldiers
i
had
a
long
talk
with
him
he
seemed
a
sensible
man
and
did
not
attempt
to
deny
the
universal
enthusiasm
and
determination
of
the
southerners
he
told
me
that
general
grant
had
been
very
nearly
killed
at
the
taking
of
jackson
he
thought
the
war
would
probably
terminate
by
a
in
the
north
i
had
to
change
cars
at
west
point
and
at
atlanta
at
the
latter
place
i
was
crammed
into
a
desperately
crowded
train
for
chattanooga
this
country
georgia
is
much
more
inhabited
and
cultivated
than
alabama
i
travelled
again
all
night
this
rigid
inspection
is
necessary
to
arrest
spies
and
prevent
straggling
and
absence
without
leave
notwithstanding
the
exasperation
with
which
every
southerner
speaks
of
a
yankee
and
all
the
talk
about
black
flag
and
no
quarter
yet
i
never
saw
a
federal
prisoner
ill
treated
or
insulted
in
any
way
although
i
have
travelled
hundreds
of
miles
in
their
company
thursday
i
arrived
at
chattanooga
tennessee
at
and
fell
in
with
captain
brown
again
his
negro
recognised
me
and
immediately
rushed
up
to
shake
hands
after
breakfasting
at
chattanooga
i
started
again
at
by
train
for
shelbyville
general
bragg
headquarters
this
train
was
crammed
to
repletion
with
soldiers
rejoining
their
regiments
so
i
was
constrained
to
sit
in
the
aisle
on
the
floor
of
one
of
the
cars
i
thought
myself
lucky
even
then
for
so
great
was
the
number
of
military
that
all
were
ordered
out
to
make
way
for
the
soldiers
but
my
grey
and
youthful
appearance
saved
me
from
the
imputation
of
being
a
citizen
two
hours
later
the
passport
officer
seeing
who
i
was
procured
me
a
similar
situation
in
the
ladies
car
where
i
was
a
little
better
off
after
leaving
chattanooga
the
railroad
winds
alongside
of
the
tennessee
river
the
banks
of
which
are
high
and
beautifully
covered
with
trees
the
river
itself
is
wide
and
very
pretty
but
from
my
position
in
the
i
was
unable
to
do
justice
to
the
scenery
i
saw
stockades
at
intervals
all
along
the
railroad
which
were
constructed
by
the
federals
who
occupied
all
this
country
last
year
on
arriving
at
wartrace
at
i
determined
to
remain
there
and
ask
for
hospitality
from
general
hardee
as
i
saw
no
prospect
of
reaching
shelbyville
in
decent
time
leaving
my
baggage
with
the
at
wartrace
i
walked
on
to
general
hardee
headquarters
which
were
distant
about
two
miles
from
the
railroad
they
were
situated
in
a
beautiful
country
green
undulating
full
of
magnificent
trees
principally
beeches
and
the
scenery
was
by
far
the
finest
i
had
seen
in
america
as
yet
when
i
arrived
i
found
that
general
hardee
was
in
company
with
general
polk
and
bishop
elliott
of
georgia
and
also
with
mr
vallandigham
the
latter
called
the
apostle
of
liberty
is
a
man
apparently
not
much
over
forty
and
had
been
turned
out
of
the
north
three
days
before
rosecrans
had
wished
to
hand
him
over
to
bragg
by
flag
of
truce
but
as
the
latter
declined
to
receive
him
in
that
manner
he
was
as
general
hardee
expressed
it
in
the
neutral
ground
between
the
lines
and
left
there
he
then
received
hospitality
from
the
confederates
in
the
capacity
of
a
destitute
stranger
they
do
not
in
any
way
receive
him
officially
and
it
does
not
suit
the
policy
of
either
party
to
be
identified
with
one
another
he
is
now
living
at
a
private
house
in
shelbyville
and
had
come
over
for
the
day
with
general
polk
on
a
visit
to
hardee
he
told
the
generals
that
if
grant
was
severely
beaten
in
mississippi
by
johnston
he
did
not
think
the
war
could
be
continued
on
its
present
great
scale
when
i
presented
my
letters
of
introduction
general
hardee
received
me
with
the
unvarying
kindness
and
hospitality
which
i
had
experienced
from
all
other
confederate
officers
he
is
a
fine
soldierlike
man
and
tall
he
looks
rather
like
a
french
officer
and
is
a
georgian
by
birth
he
bears
the
reputation
of
being
a
thoroughly
good
soldier
and
he
is
the
author
of
the
still
in
use
by
both
armies
until
quite
lately
he
was
commanding
officer
of
the
military
college
at
west
point
he
distinguished
himself
at
the
battles
of
corinth
and
murfreesborough
and
now
commands
the
of
bragg
army
he
is
a
widower
and
has
the
character
of
being
a
great
admirer
of
the
fair
sex
during
the
kentucky
campaign
last
year
he
was
in
the
habit
of
availing
himself
of
the
privilege
of
his
rank
and
years
and
insisted
upon
kissing
the
wives
and
daughters
of
all
the
kentuckian
farmers
and
although
he
is
supposed
to
have
converted
many
of
the
ladies
to
the
southern
cause
yet
in
many
instances
their
male
relatives
remained
either
neutral
or
undecided
on
one
occasion
general
hardee
had
conferred
the
accolade
upon
a
very
pretty
kentuckian
to
their
mutual
satisfaction
when
to
his
intense
disgust
the
proprietor
produced
two
very
ugly
old
females
saying
now
then
general
if
you
kiss
any
you
must
kiss
them
all
round
which
the
discomfited
general
was
forced
to
do
to
the
great
amusement
of
his
officers
who
often
allude
to
this
another
rebuff
which
he
received
and
about
which
he
is
often
chaffed
by
general
polk
was
when
an
old
lady
told
him
he
ought
really
to
leave
off
fighting
his
indeed
madam
replied
hardee
and
how
old
do
you
take
me
for
why
about
the
same
age
as
myself
the
chagrin
of
the
stalwart
and
gallant
general
at
having
twenty
years
added
to
his
age
may
be
imagined
leonidas
polk
bishop
of
louisiana
who
commands
the
other
is
a
gentlemanlike
man
with
all
the
manners
and
affability
of
a
grand
seigneur
he
is
years
of
age
tall
upright
and
looks
much
more
the
soldier
than
the
clergyman
he
is
very
rich
and
i
am
told
he
owns
seven
hundred
negroes
he
is
much
beloved
by
the
soldiers
on
account
of
his
great
personal
courage
and
agreeable
manners
i
had
already
heard
no
end
of
anecdotes
of
him
told
me
by
my
travelling
companions
who
always
alluded
to
him
with
affection
and
admiration
in
his
clerical
capacity
i
had
always
heard
him
spoken
of
with
the
greatest
respect
when
i
was
introduced
to
him
he
immediately
invited
me
to
come
and
stay
at
his
headquarters
at
shelbyville
he
told
me
that
he
was
educated
at
west
point
and
was
at
that
institution
with
the
president
the
two
johnstons
lee
magruder
and
that
after
serving
a
short
time
in
the
artillery
he
had
entered
the
church
bishop
elliott
of
georgia
is
a
nice
old
man
of
venerable
appearance
and
very
courteous
manners
he
is
here
at
the
request
of
general
polk
for
the
purpose
of
confirming
some
officers
and
soldiers
he
speaks
english
exactly
like
an
english
gentleman
and
so
in
fact
does
general
polk
and
all
the
southerners
much
more
so
than
the
ladies
whose
american
accent
can
always
be
detected
general
polk
and
mr
vallandigham
returned
to
shelbyville
in
an
ambulance
at
general
hardee
headquarters
were
on
the
estate
of
mrs
a
very
hospitable
lady
the
two
daughters
of
the
general
were
staying
with
her
and
also
a
mrs
who
is
a
very
pretty
woman
these
ladies
are
more
violent
against
the
yankees
than
it
is
possible
for
a
european
to
conceive
they
beat
their
male
relations
hollow
in
their
denunciations
and
hopes
of
vengeance
it
was
quite
depressing
to
hear
their
innumerable
stories
of
yankee
brutality
and
i
was
much
relieved
when
at
a
later
period
of
the
evening
they
subsided
into
music
after
bishop
elliott
had
read
prayers
i
slept
in
the
same
room
with
general
hardee
friday
i
took
a
walk
before
breakfast
with
dr
quintard
a
zealous
episcopal
chaplain
who
began
life
as
a
surgeon
which
enables
him
to
attend
to
the
bodily
as
well
as
the
spiritual
wants
of
the
tennessean
regiment
to
which
he
is
chaplain
the
enemy
is
about
fifteen
miles
distant
and
all
the
tops
of
the
intervening
hills
are
occupied
as
signal
stations
which
communicate
his
movements
by
flags
in
the
daytime
and
by
beacons
at
night
a
signal
corps
has
been
organised
for
this
service
the
system
is
most
ingenious
and
answers
admirably
we
all
breakfasted
at
mrs
the
ladies
were
more
excited
even
than
yesterday
in
their
diatribes
against
the
yankees
they
insisted
on
cutting
the
accompanying
paragraph
out
of
newspaper
which
they
declared
was
a
very
fair
exposition
of
the
average
treatment
they
received
from
the
enemy
they
reproved
mrs
for
having
given
assistance
to
the
wounded
yankees
at
wartrace
last
year
and
a
sister
of
mrs
who
is
a
very
lady
gave
me
a
most
amusing
description
of
an
interview
she
had
had
at
huntsville
with
the
astronomer
mitchell
in
his
capacity
of
a
yankee
general
it
has
often
been
remarked
to
me
that
when
this
war
is
over
the
independence
of
the
country
will
be
due
in
a
great
measure
to
the
women
for
they
declare
that
had
the
women
been
desponding
they
could
never
have
gone
through
with
it
but
on
the
contrary
the
women
have
invariably
set
an
example
to
the
men
of
patience
devotion
and
determination
naturally
proud
and
with
an
innate
contempt
for
the
yankees
the
southern
women
have
been
rendered
furious
and
desperate
by
the
proceedings
of
butler
milroy
turchin
they
are
all
prepared
to
undergo
any
hardships
and
misfortunes
rather
than
submit
to
the
rule
of
such
people
and
they
use
every
argument
which
women
can
employ
to
infuse
the
same
spirit
into
their
male
relations
at
noon
i
took
leave
for
the
present
of
general
hardee
and
drove
over
in
his
ambulance
to
shelbyville
eight
miles
in
company
with
bishop
elliott
and
dr
quintard
the
road
was
abominable
and
it
was
pouring
with
rain
on
arriving
at
general
polk
he
invited
me
to
take
up
my
quarters
with
him
during
my
stay
with
bragg
army
which
offer
i
accepted
with
gratitude
after
dinner
general
polk
told
me
that
he
hoped
his
brethren
in
england
did
not
very
much
condemn
his
present
line
of
conduct
he
explained
to
me
the
reasons
which
had
induced
him
temporarily
to
forsake
the
cassock
and
return
to
his
old
profession
he
stated
the
extreme
reluctance
he
had
felt
in
taking
this
step
and
he
said
that
so
soon
as
the
war
was
over
he
should
return
to
his
episcopal
avocations
in
the
same
way
as
a
man
finding
his
house
on
fire
would
use
every
means
in
his
power
to
extinguish
the
flames
and
would
then
resume
his
ordinary
pursuits
he
commanded
the
confederate
forces
at
the
battle
of
perryville
and
belmont
as
well
as
his
present
at
the
battles
of
shiloh
corinth
and
murfreesborough
at
i
called
on
general
bragg
the
this
officer
is
in
appearance
the
least
prepossessing
of
the
confederate
generals
he
is
very
thin
he
stoops
and
has
a
sickly
cadaverous
haggard
appearance
rather
plain
features
bushy
black
eyebrows
which
unite
in
a
tuft
on
the
top
of
his
nose
and
a
stubby
beard
but
his
eyes
are
bright
and
piercing
he
has
the
reputation
of
being
a
rigid
disciplinarian
and
of
shooting
freely
for
insubordination
i
understand
he
is
rather
unpopular
on
this
account
and
also
by
reason
of
his
occasional
acerbity
of
manner
he
was
extremely
civil
to
me
and
gave
me
permission
to
visit
the
outposts
or
any
part
of
his
army
he
also
promised
to
help
me
towards
joining
morgan
in
kentucky
and
he
expressed
his
regret
that
a
boil
on
his
hand
would
prevent
him
from
accompanying
me
to
the
outposts
he
told
me
that
rosecrans
position
extended
about
forty
miles
murfreesborough
miles
distant
being
his
headquarters
the
confederate
cavalry
enclosed
him
in
a
semicircle
extending
over
a
hundred
miles
of
country
he
told
me
that
west
tennessee
occupied
by
the
federals
was
devoted
to
the
confederate
cause
whilst
east
tennessee
now
in
possession
of
the
confederates
contained
numbers
of
people
of
unionist
proclivities
this
very
place
shelbyville
had
been
described
to
me
by
others
as
a
union
hole
after
my
interview
with
general
bragg
i
took
a
ride
along
the
murfreesborough
road
with
colonel
richmond
to
general
polk
about
two
miles
from
shelbyville
we
passed
some
lines
made
to
defend
the
position
the
trench
itself
was
a
very
mild
affair
but
the
higher
ground
could
be
occupied
by
artillery
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
the
road
impassable
the
thick
woods
were
being
cut
down
in
front
of
the
lines
for
a
distance
of
eight
hundred
yards
to
give
range
during
our
ride
i
met
cheetham
a
stout
rather
man
but
with
the
reputation
of
a
great
fighter
it
is
said
that
he
does
all
the
necessary
swearing
in
the
which
general
polk
clerical
character
incapacitates
him
from
performing
colonel
richmond
gave
me
the
particulars
of
general
van
dorn
death
which
occurred
about
forty
miles
from
this
his
loss
does
not
seem
to
be
much
regretted
as
it
appears
he
was
always
ready
to
neglect
his
military
duties
for
an
assignation
in
the
south
it
is
not
considered
necessary
to
put
yourself
on
an
equality
with
a
man
in
such
a
case
as
van
by
calling
him
out
his
life
belongs
to
the
aggrieved
husband
and
shooting
down
is
universally
esteemed
the
correct
thing
even
if
it
takes
place
after
a
lapse
of
time
as
in
the
affair
between
general
van
dorn
and
dr
peters
illustration
leonidas
polk
news
arrived
this
evening
of
the
capture
of
helena
by
the
confederates
and
of
the
hanging
of
a
negro
regiment
with
forty
yankee
officers
every
one
expressed
sorrow
for
the
blacks
but
applauded
the
destruction
of
their
officers
i
slept
in
general
polk
tent
he
occupying
a
room
in
the
house
adjoining
before
going
to
bed
general
polk
told
me
an
affecting
story
of
a
poor
widow
in
humble
circumstances
whose
three
sons
had
fallen
in
battle
one
after
the
other
until
she
had
only
one
left
a
boy
of
sixteen
so
distressing
was
her
case
that
general
polk
went
himself
to
comfort
her
she
looked
steadily
at
him
and
replied
to
his
condolences
by
the
sentence
as
soon
as
i
can
get
a
few
things
together
general
you
shall
have
harry
too
the
tears
came
into
general
polk
eyes
as
he
related
this
episode
which
he
ended
by
saying
can
you
subdue
such
a
nation
as
this
losses
of
william
f
the
yankees
did
not
treat
us
very
badly
as
they
returned
from
pursuing
our
men
beyond
leighton
at
least
no
more
than
we
expected
they
broke
down
our
smokehouse
door
and
took
seven
hams
went
into
the
kitchen
and
helped
themselves
to
cooking
utensils
tin
ware
searched
the
house
but
took
nothing
as
they
passed
up
the
second
time
we
were
very
much
annoyed
by
them
but
not
seriously
injured
they
took
the
only
two
mules
we
had
a
cart
our
milch
cows
and
more
meat
it
was
on
their
return
from
this
trip
that
our
losses
were
so
grievous
they
drove
their
waggons
up
in
our
yard
and
loaded
them
with
the
last
of
our
meat
all
of
our
sugar
coffee
molasses
flour
meal
and
potatoes
i
went
to
a
who
seemed
very
busy
giving
orders
and
asked
him
what
he
expected
me
to
do
they
had
left
me
no
provisions
at
all
and
i
had
a
large
family
and
my
husband
was
away
from
home
his
reply
was
short
and
pointed
and
be
d
d
madam
they
then
proceeded
to
the
took
a
fine
new
buggy
that
we
had
never
used
the
cushions
and
harness
of
our
carriage
then
cut
the
carriage
up
and
left
it
they
then
sent
about
sixty
of
the
slyest
rogues
i
have
ever
seen
in
the
federal
army
all
the
rogues
i
ever
did
see
were
in
that
army
into
the
house
to
search
for
whisky
and
money
while
the
officers
remained
in
the
trying
to
hire
the
servants
to
tell
them
where
we
had
money
hid
their
search
proving
fruitless
they
loaded
themselves
with
our
clothing
broke
my
dishes
stole
my
knives
and
forks
refused
the
keys
and
broke
open
my
trunks
closets
and
other
doors
then
came
the
worst
of
all
the
burners
or
as
they
call
themselves
the
angels
they
burned
our
and
press
with
bales
of
cotton
seven
cribs
containing
bolls
of
corn
our
logs
stables
and
six
stacks
of
fodder
a
waggon
and
four
negro
cabins
our
fine
and
dollars
worth
of
thread
axes
hoes
and
all
other
plantation
implements
then
they
came
with
their
torches
to
burn
our
house
the
last
remaining
building
they
had
left
besides
the
negro
quarter
that
was
too
much
all
my
pride
and
the
resolutions
that
i
had
made
and
until
now
kept
up
to
treat
them
with
cool
contempt
and
never
let
the
worst
come
humble
myself
to
the
thievish
cutthroats
forsook
me
at
the
awful
thought
of
my
home
in
ruins
i
must
do
something
and
that
quickly
hardened
thieving
villains
as
i
knew
them
to
be
i
would
make
one
effort
for
the
sake
of
my
home
i
looked
over
the
crowd
as
they
huddled
together
to
give
orders
about
the
burning
for
one
face
that
showed
a
trace
of
feeling
or
an
eye
that
beamed
with
a
spark
of
humanity
but
finding
none
i
approached
the
nearest
group
and
pointing
to
the
children
my
sister
i
said
will
not
burn
the
house
will
you
you
drove
those
little
ones
from
one
home
and
took
possession
of
it
and
this
is
the
only
sheltering
place
they
have
may
thank
your
god
madam
said
one
of
the
ruffians
we
have
left
you
and
your
d
d
brats
with
heads
to
be
sheltered
just
then
an
officer
galloped
up
pretended
to
be
very
much
astonished
and
terribly
beset
about
the
conduct
of
his
men
cursed
a
good
deal
and
told
a
batch
of
falsehoods
about
not
having
given
orders
to
burn
anything
but
corn
made
divers
threats
that
were
forgotten
in
utterance
and
ordered
his
to
fall
into
line
thereby
winding
up
the
troubles
of
the
darkest
day
i
have
ever
seen
mrs
ricks
losses
before
this
last
raid
six
mules
five
horses
one
waggon
negroes
this
afterwards
turned
out
to
be
untrue
saturday
it
rained
hard
all
last
night
but
general
polk
tent
proved
itself
a
good
one
we
have
prayers
both
morning
and
evening
by
dr
quintard
together
with
singing
in
which
general
polk
joins
with
much
zeal
colonel
gale
who
is
and
volunteer
to
general
polk
has
placed
his
negro
aaron
and
a
mare
at
my
disposal
during
my
stay
general
polk
explained
to
me
from
a
plan
the
battle
of
murfreesborough
he
claimed
that
the
confederates
had
only
troops
including
breckenridge
division
which
was
not
engaged
on
the
first
day
he
put
the
confederate
loss
at
men
and
that
of
the
yankees
at
with
regard
to
the
battle
of
shiloh
he
said
that
beauregard
order
to
retire
was
most
unfortunate
as
the
gunboats
were
doing
no
real
harm
and
if
they
the
confederates
had
held
on
nothing
could
have
saved
the
federals
from
capture
or
destruction
the
misfortune
of
albert
johnston
death
together
with
the
fact
of
beauregard
illness
and
his
not
being
present
at
that
particular
spot
were
the
causes
of
this
battle
not
being
a
more
complete
victory
ever
since
i
landed
in
america
i
had
heard
of
the
exploits
of
an
englishman
called
colonel
st
leger
grenfell
who
is
now
of
cavalry
to
bragg
army
this
afternoon
i
made
his
acquaintance
and
i
consider
him
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
characters
i
ever
met
although
he
is
a
member
of
a
english
family
he
seems
to
have
devoted
his
whole
life
to
the
exciting
career
of
a
soldier
of
fortune
he
told
me
that
in
early
life
he
had
served
three
years
in
a
french
lancer
regiment
and
had
risen
from
a
private
to
be
a
he
afterwards
became
a
sort
of
consular
agent
at
tangier
under
old
mr
drummond
hay
having
acquired
a
perfect
knowledge
of
arabic
he
entered
the
service
of
and
under
that
renowned
chief
he
fought
the
french
for
four
years
and
a
half
at
another
time
of
his
life
he
fitted
out
a
yacht
and
carried
on
a
private
war
with
the
riff
pirates
he
was
in
the
turkish
contingent
during
the
crimean
war
and
had
some
employment
in
the
indian
mutiny
he
has
also
been
engaged
in
war
in
buenos
ayres
and
the
south
american
republics
at
an
early
period
of
the
present
troubles
he
ran
the
blockade
and
joined
the
confederates
he
was
and
man
to
the
celebrated
john
morgan
for
eight
months
even
in
this
army
which
abounds
with
foolhardy
and
desperate
characters
he
has
acquired
the
admiration
of
all
ranks
by
his
reckless
daring
and
gallantry
in
the
field
both
generals
polk
and
bragg
spoke
to
me
of
him
as
a
most
excellent
and
useful
officer
besides
being
a
man
who
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
trying
to
throw
his
life
away
he
is
just
the
sort
of
man
to
succeed
in
this
army
and
among
the
soldiers
his
fame
for
bravery
has
outweighed
his
unpopularity
as
a
rigid
disciplinarian
he
is
the
terror
of
all
absentees
stragglers
and
deserters
and
of
all
commanding
officers
who
are
unable
to
produce
for
his
inspection
the
number
of
horses
they
have
been
drawing
forage
for
he
looks
about
but
in
reality
he
is
he
is
rather
tall
thin
very
wiry
and
active
with
a
jovial
english
expression
of
countenance
but
his
eyes
have
a
wild
roving
look
which
is
common
amongst
the
arabs
when
he
came
to
me
he
was
dressed
in
an
english
staff
blue
coat
and
he
had
a
red
cavalry
which
latter
general
polk
told
me
he
always
wore
in
action
so
making
himself
more
conspicuous
he
talked
to
me
much
about
john
morgan
whose
marriage
he
had
tried
to
avert
and
of
which
he
spoke
with
much
sorrow
he
declared
that
morgan
was
enervated
by
matrimony
and
would
never
be
the
same
man
as
he
was
he
said
that
in
one
of
the
celebrated
telegraph
tappings
in
kentucky
morgan
the
operator
and
himself
were
seated
for
twelve
hours
on
a
during
a
violent
storm
but
the
interest
was
so
intense
that
the
time
passed
like
three
hours
general
polk
son
a
young
artillery
lieutenant
told
me
this
evening
that
stonewall
jackson
was
a
professor
at
the
military
school
at
lexington
in
which
he
was
a
cadet
old
jack
was
considered
a
persevering
but
rather
dull
master
and
was
often
made
a
butt
of
by
cheeky
cadets
whose
great
ambition
it
was
to
irritate
him
but
however
insolent
they
were
he
never
took
the
slightest
notice
of
their
impertinence
at
the
time
although
he
always
had
them
punished
for
it
afterwards
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
he
was
called
upon
by
the
cadets
to
make
a
speech
and
these
were
his
words
soldiers
make
short
speeches
slow
to
draw
the
sword
in
civil
strife
but
when
you
draw
it
throw
away
the
young
polk
says
that
the
enthusiasm
created
by
this
speech
of
old
jack
was
beyond
description
called
pittsburg
landing
and
corinth
this
was
the
occasion
when
they
telegraphed
such
a
quantity
of
nonsense
to
the
yankee
general
receiving
valuable
information
in
return
and
such
necessary
stores
by
train
as
morgan
was
in
need
of
sunday
the
bishop
of
georgia
preached
to
a
very
large
congregation
in
the
presbyterian
church
he
is
a
most
eloquent
preacher
and
he
afterwards
confirmed
about
twenty
people
amongst
others
colonel
gale
over
forty
years
old
and
young
polk
after
church
i
called
again
on
general
bragg
who
talked
to
me
a
long
time
about
the
battle
of
murfreesborough
in
which
he
commanded
he
said
that
he
retained
possession
of
the
ground
he
had
won
for
three
days
and
a
half
and
only
retired
on
account
of
the
exhaustion
of
his
troops
and
after
carrying
off
over
prisoners
much
cannon
and
other
trophies
he
allowed
that
rosecrans
had
displayed
much
firmness
and
was
only
man
in
the
yankee
army
who
was
not
badly
he
showed
me
on
a
plan
the
exact
position
of
the
two
armies
and
also
the
field
of
operations
of
the
renowned
guerillas
morgan
and
forrest
colonel
grenfell
called
again
and
i
arranged
to
visit
the
outposts
with
him
on
tuesday
he
spoke
to
me
in
high
terms
of
bragg
polk
hardee
and
cleburne
but
he
described
some
of
the
others
as
political
generals
and
others
as
good
fighters
but
illiterate
and
somewhat
addicted
to
liquor
he
deplored
the
effect
of
politics
upon
military
affairs
as
very
injurious
in
the
confederate
army
though
not
so
bad
as
it
is
in
the
northern
at
i
travelled
in
the
cars
to
wartrace
in
company
with
general
bragg
and
the
bishop
of
georgia
we
were
put
into
a
and
the
general
and
the
bishop
were
the
only
persons
provided
with
seats
although
the
distance
from
shelbyville
to
wartrace
is
only
eight
miles
we
were
one
hour
and
ten
minutes
in
effecting
the
in
such
a
miserable
and
dangerous
state
were
the
rails
on
arriving
at
wartrace
we
were
entertained
by
cleburne
this
officer
gave
me
his
history
he
is
the
son
of
a
doctor
at
or
near
ballincolig
at
the
age
of
seventeen
he
ran
away
from
home
and
enlisted
in
her
majesty
regiment
of
foot
in
which
he
served
three
years
as
private
and
corporal
he
then
bought
his
discharge
and
emigrated
to
arkansas
where
he
studied
law
and
eschewing
politics
he
got
a
good
practice
as
a
lawyer
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
he
was
elected
captain
of
his
company
then
colonel
of
his
regiment
and
has
since
by
his
distinguished
services
in
all
the
western
campaigns
been
appointed
to
the
command
of
a
division
men
the
highest
military
rank
which
has
been
attained
by
a
foreigner
in
the
confederate
service
he
told
me
that
he
ascribed
his
advancement
mainly
to
the
useful
lessons
which
he
had
learnt
in
the
ranks
of
the
british
army
and
he
pointed
with
a
laugh
to
his
general
white
facings
which
he
said
his
experience
enabled
him
to
keep
cleaner
than
any
other
confederate
general
he
is
now
years
of
age
but
his
hair
having
turned
grey
he
looks
older
generals
bragg
and
hardee
both
spoke
to
me
of
him
in
terms
of
the
highest
praise
and
said
that
he
had
risen
entirely
by
his
own
personal
merit
at
i
was
present
at
a
great
preaching
at
general
camp
bishop
elliott
preached
most
admirably
to
a
congregation
composed
of
nearly
soldiers
who
listened
to
him
with
the
most
profound
attention
generals
bragg
polk
hardee
withers
cleburne
and
endless
brigadiers
were
also
present
it
is
impossible
to
exaggerate
the
respect
paid
by
all
ranks
of
this
army
to
bishop
elliott
and
although
most
of
the
officers
are
episcopalians
the
majority
of
the
soldiers
are
methodists
baptists
bishop
elliott
afterwards
explained
to
me
that
the
reason
most
of
the
people
had
become
dissenters
was
because
there
had
been
no
bishops
in
america
during
the
british
dominion
and
all
the
clergy
having
been
appointed
from
england
had
almost
without
exception
stuck
by
the
king
in
the
revolution
and
had
had
their
livings
forfeited
i
dined
and
slept
at
general
hardee
but
spent
the
evening
at
mrs
where
i
heard
renewed
philippics
directed
by
the
ladies
against
the
yankees
i
find
that
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
press
is
gagged
in
the
south
as
i
constantly
see
the
most
violent
attacks
upon
the
president
upon
the
different
generals
and
their
measures
i
heard
the
officers
complaining
bitterly
of
the
rebel
for
publishing
an
account
of
breckenridge
departure
from
this
army
to
reinforce
johnston
in
mississippi
and
thus
giving
early
intelligence
to
the
enemy
the
regiment
wears
white
facings
so
do
the
generals
in
the
confederate
army
de
polignac
has
recently
been
appointed
a
brigadier
he
and
cleburne
are
the
only
two
generals
amongst
the
confederates
who
are
foreigners
monday
we
all
went
to
a
review
of
general
brigade
at
bellbuckle
a
distance
of
six
miles
there
were
three
carriages
full
of
ladies
and
i
rode
an
excellent
horse
the
gift
of
general
john
morgan
to
general
hardee
the
weather
and
the
scenery
were
delightful
general
hardee
asked
me
particularly
whether
mr
mason
had
been
kindly
received
in
england
i
replied
that
i
thought
he
had
by
private
individuals
i
have
often
found
the
southerners
rather
touchy
on
this
point
general
liddell
brigade
was
composed
of
arkansas
troops
five
very
weak
regiments
which
had
suffered
severely
in
the
different
battles
and
they
can
not
be
easily
recruited
on
account
of
the
blockade
of
the
mississippi
the
men
were
healthy
and
well
clothed
but
without
any
attempt
at
uniformity
in
colour
or
cut
but
nearly
all
were
dressed
either
in
grey
or
brown
coats
and
felt
hats
i
was
told
that
even
if
a
regiment
was
clothed
in
proper
uniform
by
the
government
it
would
become
again
in
a
week
as
the
soldiers
preferred
wearing
the
coarse
homespun
jackets
and
trousers
made
by
their
mothers
and
sisters
at
home
the
generals
very
wisely
allow
them
to
please
themselves
in
this
respect
and
insist
only
upon
their
arms
and
accoutrements
being
kept
in
proper
order
most
of
the
officers
were
dressed
in
uniform
which
is
neat
and
serviceable
a
of
a
colour
similar
to
austrian
yagers
the
infantry
wear
blue
facings
the
artillery
red
the
doctors
black
the
staff
white
and
the
cavalry
yellow
so
it
is
impossible
to
mistake
the
branch
of
the
service
to
which
an
officer
belongs
nor
is
it
possible
to
mistake
his
rank
a
second
lieutenant
first
lieutenant
and
captain
wear
respectively
one
two
and
three
bars
on
the
collar
a
major
and
colonel
wear
one
two
and
three
stars
on
the
collar
before
the
marching
past
of
the
brigade
many
of
the
soldiers
had
taken
off
their
coats
and
marched
past
the
general
in
their
on
account
of
the
warmth
most
of
them
were
armed
with
enfield
rifles
captured
from
the
enemy
many
however
had
lost
or
thrown
away
their
bayonets
which
they
do
appear
to
value
properly
as
they
assert
that
they
have
never
met
any
yankees
who
would
wait
for
that
weapon
i
expressed
a
desire
to
see
them
form
square
but
it
appeared
they
were
not
drilled
to
such
a
manoeuvre
except
square
two
deep
they
said
the
country
did
not
admit
of
cavalry
charges
even
if
the
yankee
cavalry
had
stomach
to
attempt
it
each
regiment
carried
a
blue
with
a
white
border
on
which
were
inscribed
the
names
belmont
shiloh
perryville
richmond
and
murfreesborough
they
drilled
tolerably
well
and
an
advance
in
line
was
remarkably
good
but
general
liddell
had
invented
several
dodges
of
his
own
for
which
he
was
reproved
by
general
hardee
the
review
being
over
the
troops
were
harangued
by
bishop
elliott
in
an
excellent
address
partly
religious
partly
patriotic
he
was
followed
by
a
congress
man
of
vulgar
appearance
named
hanley
from
arkansas
who
delivered
himself
of
a
long
and
uninteresting
political
oration
and
ended
by
announcing
himself
as
a
candidate
for
this
speech
seemed
to
me
and
to
others
particularly
out
of
place
and
ridiculous
addressed
as
it
was
to
soldiers
in
front
of
the
enemy
but
this
was
one
of
the
results
of
universal
suffrage
the
soldiers
afterwards
wanted
general
hardee
to
say
something
but
he
declined
i
imagine
that
the
discipline
in
this
army
is
the
strictest
in
the
confederacy
and
that
the
men
are
much
better
marchers
than
those
i
saw
in
mississippi
a
soldier
was
shot
in
wartrace
this
afternoon
we
heard
the
volley
just
as
we
left
in
the
cars
for
shelbyville
his
crime
was
desertion
to
the
enemy
and
as
the
prisoner
brigade
was
at
tullahoma
twenty
miles
off
he
was
executed
without
ceremony
by
the
provost
guard
spies
are
hung
every
now
and
then
but
general
bragg
told
me
it
was
almost
impossible
for
either
side
to
stop
the
practice
bishop
elliott
dr
quintard
and
myself
got
back
to
general
quarters
at
where
i
was
introduced
to
a
colonel
styles
who
was
formerly
united
states
minister
at
vienna
in
the
evening
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
general
wheeler
van
dorn
successor
in
the
command
of
the
cavalry
of
this
army
which
is
over
strong
he
is
a
very
little
man
only
years
of
age
and
was
dressed
in
a
coat
much
too
big
for
him
he
made
his
reputation
by
protecting
the
retreat
of
the
army
through
kentucky
last
year
he
was
a
graduate
of
west
point
and
seems
a
remarkably
zealous
officer
besides
being
very
modest
and
unassuming
in
his
manners
general
polk
told
me
that
notwithstanding
the
departure
of
breckenridge
this
army
is
now
much
stronger
than
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
battle
of
murfreesborough
i
think
that
probably
infantry
and
artillery
could
be
brought
together
immediately
for
a
battle
tuesday
colonel
grenfell
and
i
rode
to
the
outposts
starting
on
the
road
to
murfreesborough
at
it
rained
hard
nearly
all
day
he
explained
to
me
the
method
of
fighting
adopted
by
the
western
cavalry
which
he
said
was
admirably
adapted
for
this
country
but
he
denied
that
they
could
under
any
circumstances
stand
a
fair
charge
of
regular
cavalry
in
the
open
their
system
is
to
dismount
and
leave
their
horses
in
some
secure
place
one
man
is
placed
in
charge
of
his
own
and
three
other
horses
whilst
the
remainder
act
as
infantry
skirmishers
in
the
dense
woods
and
broken
country
making
a
tremendous
row
and
deceiving
the
enemy
as
to
their
numbers
and
as
to
their
character
as
infantry
or
cavalry
in
this
manner
morgan
assisted
by
two
small
guns
called
bulldogs
attacked
the
yankees
with
success
in
towns
forts
stockades
and
steamboats
and
by
the
same
system
wheeler
and
wharton
kept
a
large
pursuing
army
in
check
for
days
retreating
and
fighting
every
day
and
deluding
the
enemy
with
the
idea
that
they
were
being
resisted
by
a
strong
force
composed
of
all
three
branches
of
the
service
colonel
grenfell
told
me
that
the
only
way
in
which
an
officer
could
acquire
influence
over
the
confederate
soldiers
was
by
his
personal
conduct
under
fire
they
hold
a
man
in
great
esteem
who
in
action
sets
them
an
example
of
contempt
for
danger
but
they
think
nothing
of
an
officer
who
is
not
in
the
habit
of
them
in
fact
such
a
man
could
not
possibly
retain
his
position
colonel
grenfell
expression
was
every
atom
of
authority
has
to
be
purchased
by
a
drop
of
your
blood
he
told
me
he
was
in
desperate
hot
water
with
the
civil
authorities
of
the
state
who
accuse
him
of
illegally
impressing
and
appropriating
horses
and
also
of
conniving
at
the
escape
of
a
negro
from
his
lawful
owner
and
he
said
that
the
military
authorities
were
afraid
or
unable
to
give
him
proper
protection
for
the
first
nine
miles
our
road
was
quite
straight
and
hilly
with
a
thick
wood
on
either
side
we
then
reached
a
pass
in
the
hills
called
guy
gap
which
from
the
position
of
the
hills
is
very
strong
and
could
be
held
by
a
small
force
the
range
of
hills
extends
as
far
as
wartrace
but
i
understand
the
position
could
be
turned
on
the
left
about
two
miles
beyond
guy
gap
were
the
headquarters
of
general
martin
the
officer
who
commands
the
brigade
of
cavalry
stationed
in
the
neighbourhood
general
martin
showed
me
the
letter
sent
by
the
yankees
a
few
days
ago
by
flag
of
truce
with
mr
vallandigham
this
letter
was
curiously
worded
and
ended
as
far
as
i
can
remember
with
this
expression
mr
vallandigham
is
therefore
handed
over
to
the
respectful
attention
of
the
confederate
authorities
general
martin
told
me
that
skirmishing
and
bushwhacking
went
on
nearly
every
day
and
that
ten
days
ago
the
enemy
cavalry
by
a
bold
dash
had
captured
a
close
to
his
own
quarters
it
was
however
retaken
and
its
captors
were
killed
one
of
general
martin
staff
officers
conducted
us
to
the
bivouac
of
colonel
webb
three
miles
further
along
the
road
who
commanded
the
regiment
on
outpost
duty
there
alabama
cavalry
this
colonel
webb
was
a
lawyer
by
profession
and
seemed
a
capital
fellow
and
he
insisted
on
riding
with
us
to
the
videttes
in
spite
of
the
rain
and
he
also
desired
his
regiment
to
turn
out
for
us
by
the
time
we
returned
the
extreme
outposts
were
about
two
miles
beyond
colonel
webb
post
and
about
sixteen
miles
from
shelbyville
the
neutral
ground
extended
for
about
three
miles
we
rode
along
it
as
far
as
it
was
safe
to
do
so
and
just
came
within
sight
of
the
yankee
videttes
the
confederate
videttes
were
at
an
interval
of
from
to
yards
of
each
other
colonel
webb
regiment
was
in
charge
of
two
miles
of
the
front
and
in
a
similar
manner
the
chain
of
videttes
was
extended
by
other
corps
right
and
left
for
more
than
eighty
miles
scouts
are
continually
sent
forward
by
both
sides
to
collect
information
rival
scouts
and
pickets
invariably
fire
on
one
another
whenever
they
meet
and
colonel
webb
offered
if
i
was
particularly
anxious
to
see
their
customs
and
habits
to
send
forward
a
few
men
and
have
a
little
fight
i
thanked
him
much
for
his
kind
offer
but
begged
he
would
trouble
himself
so
far
on
my
account
he
showed
me
the
house
where
vallandigham
had
been
dumped
down
between
the
outposts
when
they
refused
to
receive
him
by
flag
of
truce
the
woods
on
both
sides
of
the
road
showed
many
signs
of
the
conflicts
which
are
of
daily
occurrence
most
of
the
houses
by
the
roadside
had
been
destroyed
but
one
plucky
old
lady
had
steadfastly
refused
to
turn
out
although
her
house
was
constantly
an
object
of
contention
and
showed
many
marks
of
bullets
and
shell
men
were
employed
every
day
in
colonel
webb
regiment
to
patrol
the
front
the
remainder
of
the
alabama
were
mounted
and
drawn
up
to
receive
colonel
grenfell
on
our
return
from
the
outposts
they
were
uniformly
armed
with
long
rifles
and
revolvers
but
without
sabres
and
they
were
a
fine
body
of
young
men
their
horses
were
in
much
better
condition
than
might
have
been
expected
considering
the
scanty
food
and
hard
duty
they
had
had
to
put
up
with
for
the
last
five
months
without
shelter
of
any
kind
except
the
trees
colonel
grenfell
told
me
they
were
a
very
fair
specimen
of
the
immense
number
of
cavalry
with
bragg
army
i
got
back
to
shelbyville
at
just
in
time
to
be
present
at
an
interesting
ceremony
peculiar
to
america
this
was
a
baptism
at
the
episcopal
church
the
ceremony
was
performed
in
an
impressive
manner
by
bishop
elliott
and
the
person
baptised
was
no
less
than
the
of
the
army
the
bishop
took
the
general
hand
in
his
own
the
latter
kneeling
in
front
of
the
font
and
said
braxton
if
thou
hast
not
already
been
baptised
i
baptise
thee
immediately
afterwards
he
confirmed
general
bragg
who
then
shook
hands
with
general
polk
the
officers
of
their
respective
staffs
and
myself
who
were
the
only
spectators
the
soldiers
on
sentry
at
general
polk
quarters
this
afternoon
were
deficient
both
of
shoes
and
stockings
these
were
the
first
barefooted
soldiers
i
had
as
yet
seen
in
the
confederacy
i
had
intended
to
have
left
shelbyville
with
bishop
elliott
but
as
i
was
informed
that
a
reconnaissance
in
force
was
arranged
for
i
accepted
general
polk
kind
offer
of
farther
hospitality
for
a
couple
of
days
more
four
of
polk
brigades
with
artillery
move
to
the
front
and
general
hardee
is
also
to
push
forward
from
wartrace
the
object
of
this
movement
is
to
ascertain
the
strength
at
murfreesborough
as
rumour
asserts
that
rosecrans
is
strengthening
grant
in
mississippi
which
general
bragg
is
not
disposed
to
allow
with
impunity
the
weather
is
now
almost
chilly
wednesday
bishop
elliott
left
for
savannah
at
in
a
downpour
of
rain
which
continued
nearly
all
day
grenfell
came
to
see
me
this
morning
in
a
towering
rage
he
had
been
arrested
in
his
bed
by
the
civil
power
on
a
charge
of
and
conniving
at
the
escape
of
a
negro
from
his
master
general
bragg
himself
had
stood
bail
for
him
but
grenfell
was
naturally
furious
at
the
indignity
but
even
according
to
his
own
account
he
seems
to
have
acted
indiscreetly
in
the
affair
of
the
negro
and
he
will
have
to
appear
before
the
civil
court
next
october
general
polk
and
his
officers
were
all
much
vexed
at
the
occurrence
which
however
is
an
extraordinary
and
convincing
proof
that
the
military
had
not
superseded
the
civil
power
in
the
southern
states
for
here
was
an
important
officer
arrested
in
spite
of
the
when
in
the
execution
of
his
office
before
the
enemy
by
standing
bail
general
bragg
gave
a
most
positive
proof
that
he
exonerated
grenfell
from
any
malpractices
in
the
evening
after
dark
general
polk
drew
my
attention
to
the
manner
in
which
the
signal
beacons
were
worked
one
light
was
stationary
on
the
ground
whilst
another
was
moved
backwards
and
forwards
over
it
they
gave
us
intelligence
that
general
hardee
had
pushed
the
enemy
to
within
five
miles
of
murfreesborough
after
heavy
skirmishing
all
day
i
got
out
of
general
polk
the
story
of
his
celebrated
adventure
with
the
indiana
northern
regiment
which
resulted
in
the
almost
total
destruction
of
that
corps
i
had
often
during
my
travels
heard
officers
and
soldiers
talking
of
this
extraordinary
feat
of
the
bishop
the
modest
yet
graphic
manner
in
which
general
polk
related
this
wonderful
instance
of
coolness
and
bravery
was
extremely
interesting
and
i
now
repeat
it
as
nearly
as
i
can
in
his
own
words
well
sir
it
was
at
the
battle
of
perryville
late
in
the
evening
in
fact
it
was
almost
dark
when
liddell
brigade
came
into
action
shortly
after
its
arrival
i
observed
a
body
of
men
whom
i
believed
to
be
confederates
standing
at
an
angle
to
this
brigade
and
firing
obliquely
at
the
newly
arrived
troops
i
said
me
this
is
very
sad
and
must
be
stopped
so
i
turned
round
but
could
find
none
of
my
young
men
who
were
absent
on
different
messages
so
i
determined
to
ride
myself
and
settle
the
matter
having
cantered
up
to
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
which
was
firing
i
asked
him
in
angry
tones
what
he
meant
by
shooting
his
own
friends
and
i
desired
him
to
cease
doing
so
at
once
he
answered
with
surprise
do
think
there
can
be
any
mistake
about
it
i
am
sure
they
are
the
enemy
i
said
i
have
only
just
left
them
myself
cease
firing
sir
what
is
your
name
sir
name
is
colonel
of
the
indiana
and
pray
sir
who
are
you
then
for
the
first
time
i
saw
to
my
astonishment
that
he
was
a
yankee
and
that
i
was
in
rear
of
a
regiment
of
yankees
well
i
saw
that
there
was
no
hope
but
to
brazen
it
out
my
dark
blouse
and
the
increasing
obscurity
befriended
me
so
i
approached
quite
close
to
him
and
shook
my
fist
in
his
face
saying
soon
show
you
who
i
am
sir
cease
firing
sir
at
once
i
then
turned
my
horse
and
cantered
slowly
down
the
line
shouting
in
an
authoritative
manner
to
the
yankees
to
cease
firing
at
the
same
time
i
experienced
a
disagreeable
sensation
like
screwing
up
my
back
and
calculating
how
many
bullets
would
be
between
my
shoulders
every
moment
i
was
afraid
to
increase
my
pace
until
i
got
to
a
small
copse
when
i
put
the
spurs
in
and
galloped
back
to
my
men
i
immediately
went
up
to
the
nearest
colonel
and
said
to
him
i
have
reconnoitred
those
fellows
pretty
closely
and
i
find
there
is
no
mistake
who
they
are
you
may
get
up
and
go
at
them
and
i
assure
you
sir
that
the
slaughter
of
that
indiana
regiment
was
the
greatest
i
have
ever
seen
in
the
war
it
is
evident
to
me
that
a
certain
degree
of
jealous
feeling
exists
between
the
tennesseean
and
virginian
armies
this
one
claims
to
have
had
harder
fighting
than
the
virginian
army
and
to
have
been
opposed
to
the
best
troops
and
best
generals
of
the
north
the
southerners
generally
appear
to
estimate
highest
the
federal
troops
which
compose
in
a
great
degree
the
armies
of
grant
and
rosecrans
they
come
from
the
states
of
ohio
iowa
indiana
the
irish
federals
are
also
respected
for
their
fighting
qualities
whilst
the
genuine
yankees
and
germans
dutch
are
not
much
esteemed
i
have
been
agreeably
disappointed
in
the
climate
of
tennessee
which
appears
quite
temperate
to
what
i
had
expected
i
cut
this
out
of
a
charleston
paper
some
days
after
i
had
parted
from
colonel
grenfell
colonel
grenfell
was
only
obeying
general
orders
in
depriving
the
soldier
of
his
horse
and
temporarily
of
his
money
colonel
st
leger
the
western
army
correspondent
of
the
register
writes
as
follows
the
famous
colonel
st
leger
grenfell
who
served
with
morgan
last
summer
and
since
that
time
has
been
assistant
of
general
bragg
was
arrested
a
few
days
since
by
the
civil
authorities
the
sheriff
and
his
officers
called
upon
the
bold
englishman
before
he
had
arisen
in
the
morning
and
after
the
latter
had
performed
his
toilet
duties
he
buckled
on
his
belt
and
trusty
pistols
the
officer
of
the
law
remonstrated
and
the
englisher
damned
and
a
struggle
of
half
an
hour
ensued
in
which
the
stout
britisher
made
a
powerful
resistance
but
by
overpowering
force
was
at
last
placed
de
and
disarmed
the
charges
were
that
he
retained
in
his
possession
the
slave
of
a
confederate
citizen
and
refused
to
deliver
him
or
her
up
that
meeting
a
soldier
coming
to
the
army
leading
a
horse
he
accused
him
of
being
a
deserter
dismounted
him
took
his
horses
and
equipments
and
stating
that
deserters
were
not
worthy
to
have
either
horses
or
money
and
sent
the
owner
thereof
off
where
he
would
not
be
heard
of
again
the
result
of
the
affair
was
that
colonel
grenfell
whether
guilty
or
not
guilty
delivered
up
the
negro
horses
and
money
to
the
civil
authorities
if
the
charges
against
him
are
proven
true
then
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
course
of
general
bragg
will
be
to
dismiss
him
from
his
staff
but
if
on
the
contrary
malicious
slanders
are
defaming
this
ally
he
is
hercules
enough
and
brave
enough
to
punish
them
his
bravery
and
gallantry
were
conspicuous
throughout
the
kentucky
campaign
and
it
is
hoped
that
this
late
tarnish
on
his
fame
will
be
removed
or
if
it
be
not
that
he
will
this
is
all
nonsense
the
myrmidons
of
the
law
took
very
good
care
to
pounce
upon
colonel
grenfell
when
he
was
in
bed
and
asleep
if
these
lines
should
ever
meet
the
eyes
of
general
polk
i
hope
he
will
forgive
me
if
i
have
made
any
error
in
recording
his
adventure
thursday
colonel
richmond
rode
with
me
to
the
outposts
in
order
to
be
present
at
the
reconnaissance
which
was
being
conducted
under
the
command
of
general
cheetham
we
reached
the
field
of
operations
at
and
found
that
martin
cavalry
dismounted
had
advanced
upon
the
enemy
about
three
miles
and
after
some
brisk
skirmishing
had
driven
in
his
outposts
the
enemy
showed
about
infantry
strongly
posted
his
guns
commanding
the
turnpike
road
the
confederate
infantry
was
concealed
in
the
woods
about
a
mile
in
rear
of
the
dismounted
cavalry
this
being
the
position
of
affairs
colonel
richmond
and
i
rode
along
the
road
so
far
as
it
was
safe
to
do
so
we
then
dismounted
and
sneaked
on
in
the
wood
alongside
the
road
until
we
got
to
within
yards
of
the
yankees
whom
we
then
reconnoitred
leisurely
with
our
glasses
we
could
only
count
about
seventy
infantry
soldiers
with
one
in
the
wood
at
an
angle
of
the
road
and
we
saw
several
staff
officers
galloping
about
with
orders
whilst
we
were
thus
engaged
some
heavy
firing
and
loud
cheering
suddenly
commenced
in
the
woods
on
our
left
so
fearing
to
be
outflanked
we
remounted
and
rode
back
to
an
open
space
about
yards
to
the
rear
where
we
found
general
martin
giving
orders
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
cavalry
horses
in
the
front
and
the
retreat
of
the
skirmishers
it
was
very
curious
to
see
three
hundred
horses
suddenly
emerge
from
the
wood
just
in
front
of
us
where
they
had
been
hidden
one
man
to
every
four
horses
riding
one
and
leading
the
other
three
which
were
tied
together
by
the
heads
in
this
order
i
saw
them
cross
a
at
a
smart
trot
and
take
up
a
more
secure
position
two
or
three
men
cantered
about
in
the
rear
flanking
up
the
led
horses
they
were
shortly
afterwards
followed
by
the
men
of
the
regiment
retreating
in
skirmishing
order
under
colonel
webb
and
they
lined
a
fence
parallel
to
us
the
same
thing
went
on
on
our
right
as
the
firing
on
our
left
still
continued
my
friends
were
in
great
hopes
that
the
yankees
might
be
inveigled
on
to
follow
the
retreating
skirmishers
until
they
fell
in
with
the
two
infantry
brigades
which
were
lying
in
ambush
for
them
and
it
was
arranged
in
that
case
that
some
mounted
confederates
should
then
get
in
their
rear
and
so
capture
a
good
number
but
this
simple
and
ingenious
device
was
frustrated
by
the
sulkiness
of
the
enemy
who
now
stubbornly
refused
to
advance
any
further
the
way
in
which
the
horses
were
managed
was
very
pretty
and
seemed
to
answer
admirably
for
this
sort
of
skirmishing
they
were
never
far
from
the
men
who
could
mount
and
be
off
to
another
part
of
the
field
with
rapidity
or
retire
to
take
up
another
position
or
act
as
cavalry
as
the
case
might
require
both
the
superior
officers
and
the
men
behaved
with
the
most
complete
coolness
and
whilst
we
were
waiting
in
hopes
of
a
yankee
advance
i
heard
the
soldiers
remarking
that
they
did
like
being
done
out
of
their
good
boots
one
of
the
principal
objects
in
killing
a
yankee
being
apparently
to
get
hold
of
his
valuable
boots
a
tremendous
row
went
on
in
the
woods
during
this
bushwhacking
and
the
trees
got
knocked
about
in
all
directions
by
shell
but
i
imagine
that
the
actual
slaughter
in
these
skirmishes
is
very
small
unless
they
get
fairly
at
one
another
in
the
open
cultivated
spaces
between
the
woods
i
did
not
see
or
hear
of
anybody
being
killed
although
there
were
a
few
wounded
and
some
horses
killed
colonel
richmond
and
colonel
webb
were
much
disappointed
that
the
inactivity
of
the
enemy
prevented
my
seeing
the
skirmish
assume
larger
proportions
and
general
cheetham
said
to
me
we
should
be
very
happy
to
see
you
colonel
when
we
are
in
our
regular
way
of
doing
business
after
waiting
in
vain
until
and
seeing
no
signs
of
anything
more
taking
place
colonel
richmond
and
i
cantered
back
to
shelbyville
we
were
accompanied
by
a
detachment
of
general
polk
which
was
composed
of
young
men
of
good
position
in
new
orleans
most
of
them
spoke
in
the
french
language
and
nearly
all
had
slaves
in
the
field
with
them
although
they
ranked
only
as
private
soldiers
and
had
to
perform
the
onerous
duties
of
orderlies
or
couriers
as
they
are
called
on
our
way
back
we
heard
heavy
firing
on
our
left
from
the
direction
in
which
general
withers
was
conducting
his
share
of
the
reconnaissance
with
two
other
infantry
brigades
after
dark
general
polk
got
a
message
from
cheetham
to
say
that
the
enemy
had
after
all
advanced
in
heavy
force
about
and
obliged
him
to
retire
to
guy
gap
we
also
heard
that
general
cleburne
who
had
advanced
from
wartrace
had
had
his
horse
shot
under
him
the
object
of
the
reconnaissance
seemed
therefore
to
have
been
attained
for
apparently
the
enemy
was
still
in
strong
force
at
murfreesborough
and
manifested
no
intention
of
yielding
it
without
a
struggle
i
took
leave
of
general
polk
before
i
turned
in
his
kindness
and
hospitality
have
exceeded
anything
i
could
have
expected
i
shall
always
feel
grateful
to
him
on
this
account
and
i
shall
never
think
of
him
without
admiration
for
his
character
as
a
sincere
patriot
a
gallant
soldier
and
a
perfect
gentleman
his
colonels
richmond
and
yeatman
are
also
excellent
types
of
the
higher
class
of
southerner
highly
educated
wealthy
and
prosperous
before
the
war
they
have
abandoned
all
for
their
country
they
and
all
other
southern
gentlemen
of
the
same
rank
are
proud
of
their
descent
from
englishmen
they
glory
in
speaking
english
as
we
do
and
that
their
manners
and
feelings
resemble
those
of
the
upper
classes
in
the
old
country
no
could
perform
their
duties
with
more
zeal
and
efficiency
than
these
gentlemen
although
they
were
not
educated
as
soldiers
friday
i
left
shelbyville
at
after
having
been
shaken
hands
with
affectionately
by
aaron
and
arrived
at
chattanooga
at
as
i
was
thus
far
under
the
protection
of
lieutenant
donnelson
of
general
polk
staff
i
made
this
journey
under
more
agreeable
auspices
than
the
last
time
the
scenery
was
really
quite
beautiful
east
tennessee
is
said
to
contain
many
people
who
are
more
favourable
to
the
north
than
to
the
south
and
its
inhabitants
are
now
being
conscripted
by
the
confederates
but
they
sometimes
object
to
this
operation
and
taking
to
the
hills
and
woods
commence
bushwhacking
there
i
left
chattanooga
for
atlanta
at
the
train
was
much
crowded
with
wounded
and
sick
soldiers
returning
on
leave
to
their
homes
a
woman
was
pointed
out
to
me
in
the
cars
as
having
served
as
a
private
soldier
in
the
battles
of
perryville
and
murfreesborough
several
men
in
my
car
had
served
with
her
in
a
louisianian
regiment
and
they
said
she
had
been
turned
out
a
short
time
since
for
her
bad
and
immoral
conduct
they
told
me
that
her
sex
was
notorious
to
all
the
regiment
but
no
notice
had
been
taken
of
it
so
long
as
she
conducted
herself
properly
they
also
said
that
she
was
not
the
only
representative
of
the
female
sex
in
the
ranks
when
i
saw
her
she
wore
a
soldier
hat
and
coat
but
had
resumed
her
petticoats
saturday
arrived
at
atlanta
at
and
took
three
hours
sleep
at
the
trouthouse
hotel
after
breakfasting
i
started
again
for
augusta
at
miles
but
the
train
had
not
proceeded
ten
miles
before
it
was
brought
up
by
an
obstruction
in
the
shape
of
a
freight
train
one
of
whose
cars
was
completely
smashed
this
delayed
us
for
about
an
hour
but
we
made
up
for
it
afterwards
and
arrived
at
augusta
at
the
country
through
georgia
is
undulating
well
cultivated
and
moderately
covered
with
trees
and
this
part
of
the
confederacy
has
as
yet
suffered
but
little
from
the
war
at
some
of
the
stations
provisions
for
the
soldiers
were
brought
into
the
cars
by
ladies
and
distributed
gratis
when
i
refused
on
the
ground
of
not
being
a
soldier
these
ladies
looked
at
me
with
great
suspicion
mingled
with
contempt
and
as
their
looks
evidently
expressed
the
words
then
why
are
you
not
a
soldier
i
was
obliged
to
explain
to
them
who
i
was
and
show
them
general
bragg
pass
which
astonished
them
not
a
little
i
was
told
that
georgia
was
the
only
state
in
which
soldiers
were
still
so
liberally
treated
they
have
become
so
very
common
everywhere
else
on
reaching
augusta
i
put
up
at
the
hotel
which
seemed
very
luxurious
to
me
after
so
many
hours
of
the
cars
but
the
augusta
climate
is
evidently
much
hotter
than
tennessee
sunday
augusta
is
a
city
of
inhabitants
but
its
streets
being
extremely
wide
and
its
houses
low
it
covers
a
vast
space
no
place
that
i
have
seen
in
the
southern
states
shows
so
little
traces
of
the
war
and
it
formed
a
delightful
contrast
to
the
towns
i
had
lately
visited
i
went
to
the
episcopal
church
and
might
almost
have
fancied
myself
in
england
the
ceremonies
were
exactly
the
same
and
the
church
was
full
of
people
at
i
dined
at
the
house
of
mr
carmichael
to
bishop
elliott
who
told
me
there
were
volunteers
in
augusta
regularly
drilled
and
prepared
to
resist
raids
these
men
were
exempted
from
the
conscription
either
on
account
of
their
age
nationality
or
other
cause
or
had
purchased
substitutes
at
mr
carmichael
sent
me
in
his
buggy
to
call
on
colonel
rains
the
superintendent
of
the
government
works
here
my
principal
object
in
stopping
at
augusta
was
to
visit
the
powder
manufactory
and
arsenal
but
to
my
disappointment
i
discovered
that
the
present
wants
of
the
state
did
not
render
it
necessary
to
keep
these
establishments
open
on
sundays
i
had
a
long
and
most
interesting
conversation
with
colonel
rains
who
is
a
very
clever
and
agreeable
officer
he
was
brought
up
at
west
point
and
after
a
short
service
in
the
united
states
army
he
became
professor
of
chemistry
at
the
military
college
he
was
afterwards
much
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
machinery
in
the
northern
states
at
the
commencement
of
this
war
with
his
usual
perspicacity
president
davis
selected
colonel
rains
as
the
most
competent
person
to
build
and
to
work
the
government
factories
at
augusta
giving
him
to
act
as
he
thought
best
and
the
result
has
proved
the
wisdom
of
the
president
choice
colonel
rains
told
me
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
troubles
scarcely
a
grain
of
gunpowder
was
manufactured
in
the
whole
of
the
southern
states
the
augusta
and
arsenal
were
then
commenced
and
less
than
lb
of
powder
are
now
made
every
in
the
powder
manufactory
the
cost
to
the
government
of
making
the
powder
is
only
four
cents
a
pound
the
saltpetre
of
which
runs
the
blockade
from
england
cost
formerly
cents
but
has
latterly
been
more
expensive
in
the
construction
of
the
colonel
rains
told
me
he
had
been
much
indebted
to
a
pamphlet
by
major
bradley
of
waltham
abbey
at
the
cannon
foundry
one
napoleon
is
turned
out
every
two
days
but
it
is
hoped
very
soon
that
one
of
these
guns
may
be
finished
daily
the
guns
are
made
of
a
metal
recently
invented
by
the
austrians
and
recommended
to
the
confederate
government
by
mr
mason
they
are
tested
by
a
charge
of
ten
pounds
of
powder
and
by
loading
them
to
the
muzzle
with
bolts
two
hundred
excellent
mechanics
are
exempted
from
the
conscription
to
be
employed
at
the
mills
the
wonderful
speed
with
which
these
works
have
been
constructed
their
great
success
and
their
immense
national
value
are
convincing
proofs
of
the
determined
energy
of
the
southern
character
now
that
it
has
been
roused
and
also
of
the
zeal
and
skill
of
colonel
rains
he
told
me
that
augusta
had
been
selected
as
a
site
for
these
works
on
account
of
its
remoteness
from
the
probable
seats
of
war
of
its
central
position
and
of
its
great
facilities
of
transport
for
this
city
can
boast
of
a
navigable
river
and
a
canal
besides
being
situated
on
a
central
railroad
colonel
rains
said
that
although
the
southerners
had
certainly
been
hard
up
for
gunpowder
at
the
early
part
of
the
war
they
were
still
harder
up
for
percussion
caps
an
immense
number
i
forget
how
many
of
these
are
now
made
daily
in
the
government
factory
at
atlanta
i
left
augusta
at
by
train
for
charleston
my
car
was
much
crowded
with
yankee
prisoners
monday
i
arrived
at
charleston
at
and
drove
at
once
in
an
omnibus
to
the
charleston
hotel
at
nine
i
called
at
general
beauregard
office
but
to
my
disappointment
i
found
that
he
was
absent
on
a
tour
of
inspection
in
florida
he
is
however
expected
to
return
in
two
or
three
days
i
then
called
on
general
ripley
who
commands
the
garrison
and
forts
of
charleston
he
is
a
jovial
character
very
fond
of
the
good
things
of
this
life
but
it
is
said
that
he
never
allows
this
propensity
to
interfere
with
his
military
duties
in
the
performance
of
which
he
displays
both
zeal
and
talent
he
has
the
reputation
of
being
an
excellent
artillery
officer
and
although
by
birth
a
northerner
he
is
a
and
indefatigable
rebel
i
believe
he
wrote
a
book
about
the
mexican
war
and
after
leaving
the
old
army
he
was
a
good
deal
in
england
connected
with
the
factory
at
enfield
and
other
enterprises
of
the
same
sort
nearly
all
the
credit
of
the
efficiency
of
the
charleston
fortifications
is
due
to
him
and
notwithstanding
his
northern
birth
and
occasional
rollicking
habits
he
is
generally
popular
i
then
called
on
mr
robertson
a
merchant
for
whom
i
had
brought
a
letter
of
introduction
from
england
this
old
gentleman
took
me
for
a
drive
in
his
buggy
at
it
appears
that
at
this
time
of
year
the
country
outside
the
city
is
quite
pestilential
for
when
we
reached
the
open
mr
robertson
pointed
to
a
detached
house
and
said
now
i
am
as
fond
of
money
as
any
jew
yet
i
would
sleep
in
that
house
for
one
night
if
you
gave
it
to
me
for
doing
so
i
had
intended
to
have
visited
mr
blake
an
english
gentleman
for
whom
i
had
a
letter
on
his
combahee
plantation
but
mr
robertson
implored
me
to
abandon
this
idea
mr
robertson
was
full
of
the
disasters
which
had
resulted
from
a
recent
yankee
raid
of
the
combahee
river
it
appears
that
a
vast
amount
of
property
had
been
destroyed
and
slaves
carried
off
this
morning
i
saw
a
poor
old
planter
in
mr
robertson
office
who
had
been
suddenly
and
totally
ruined
by
this
raid
the
raiders
consisted
principally
of
northern
armed
negroes
and
as
they
met
with
no
southern
whites
to
resist
them
they
were
able
to
effect
their
depredations
with
total
impunity
it
seems
that
a
good
deal
of
the
land
about
charleston
belongs
either
to
blakes
or
heywards
mr
blake
lost
thirty
negroes
in
the
last
raid
but
he
has
lost
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
about
mr
robertson
afterwards
took
me
to
see
mrs
who
is
mr
walter
blake
daughter
to
me
who
had
roughed
it
for
ten
weeks
to
such
an
extent
charleston
appeared
most
comfortable
and
luxurious
but
its
inhabitants
must
to
say
the
least
be
suffering
great
inconvenience
the
lighting
and
paving
of
the
city
had
gone
to
the
bad
completely
most
of
the
shops
were
shut
up
those
that
were
open
contained
but
very
few
goods
and
those
were
at
famine
prices
i
tried
to
buy
a
black
scarf
but
i
could
find
such
an
article
in
all
charleston
an
immense
amount
of
speculation
in
was
going
on
and
a
great
deal
of
business
is
evidently
done
in
buying
and
selling
negroes
for
the
papers
are
full
of
advertisements
of
slave
auctions
that
portion
of
the
city
destroyed
by
the
great
fire
presents
the
appearance
of
a
vast
wilderness
in
the
very
centre
of
the
town
no
attempt
having
been
made
towards
rebuilding
it
this
desert
space
looks
like
the
pompeian
ruins
and
extends
mr
robertson
says
for
a
mile
in
length
by
half
a
mile
in
width
nearly
all
the
distance
between
the
mills
house
hotel
and
charleston
hotel
is
in
this
desolate
state
the
fire
began
quite
by
accident
but
the
violent
wind
which
suddenly
arose
rendered
all
attempts
to
stop
the
flames
abortive
the
deserted
state
of
the
wharves
is
melancholy
the
huge
placards
announcing
lines
of
steamers
to
new
york
new
orleans
and
to
different
parts
of
the
world
still
remain
and
give
one
an
idea
of
what
a
busy
scene
they
used
to
be
the
people
however
all
seem
happy
contented
and
determined
both
the
great
hotels
are
crowded
and
well
dressed
handsome
ladies
are
plentiful
the
fare
is
good
and
the
charge
at
the
charleston
hotel
is
eight
dollars
a
day
tuesday
a
captain
feilden
came
to
call
upon
me
at
he
is
an
englishman
and
formerly
served
in
the
highlanders
he
is
now
in
the
confederate
army
and
is
on
the
staff
of
general
army
i
remember
his
brother
quite
well
at
sandhurst
captain
feilden
accompanied
me
to
general
ripley
office
and
at
the
latter
officer
took
us
in
his
boat
to
inspect
fort
sumter
our
party
consisted
of
an
invalid
general
davis
a
congress
man
named
nutt
captain
feilden
the
general
and
myself
we
reached
fort
sumter
after
a
pull
of
about
of
an
hour
this
now
celebrated
fort
is
a
pentagonal
work
built
of
red
brick
it
has
two
tiers
of
casemates
besides
a
heavy
barbette
battery
its
walls
are
twelve
feet
thick
at
the
piers
and
six
feet
thick
at
the
embrasures
it
rises
sheer
out
of
the
water
and
is
apparently
situated
in
the
centre
of
the
bay
but
on
its
side
towards
james
island
the
water
is
extremely
shallow
it
mounts
guns
of
a
motley
but
efficient
description
columbiads
predominate
and
are
perhaps
the
most
useful
they
weigh
lb
cwt
throw
a
solid
shot
weighing
and
are
made
to
traverse
with
the
greatest
ease
by
means
of
yates
system
of
cogwheels
there
are
also
columbiads
rifled
pounders
and
brook
guns
to
throw
projectiles
general
ripley
told
me
that
these
brook
guns
about
which
so
much
is
said
differ
but
little
from
the
blakely
cannon
also
there
are
parrot
guns
and
dahlgrens
in
fact
a
general
assortment
of
every
species
of
ordnance
except
whitworths
and
armstrongs
but
the
best
gun
in
the
fort
is
a
fine
new
gun
which
had
just
been
fished
up
from
the
wreck
of
the
keokuk
the
sister
gun
from
the
same
wreck
is
at
the
garrison
consists
of
enlisted
soldiers
under
colonel
rhett
they
are
called
confederate
states
regulars
and
certainly
they
saluted
in
a
more
soldierlike
way
than
the
ordinary
volunteers
a
great
proportion
of
them
are
foreigners
fort
sumter
now
shows
but
little
signs
of
the
battering
it
underwent
from
the
ironclads
eight
weeks
ago
the
two
faces
exposed
to
fire
have
been
patched
up
so
that
large
pieces
of
masonry
have
a
newer
appearance
than
the
mass
of
the
building
the
guns
have
been
removed
from
the
casemates
on
the
eastern
face
and
the
lower
tier
of
casemates
has
been
filled
up
with
earth
to
give
extra
strength
and
prevent
the
balls
from
coming
right
through
into
the
interior
of
the
work
which
happened
at
the
last
attack
there
is
consequently
a
deep
hole
in
the
parade
inside
fort
sumter
from
which
the
earth
had
been
taken
to
fill
up
these
casemates
the
angles
of
sumter
are
being
strengthened
outside
by
stone
buttresses
some
of
the
cheeks
of
the
upper
embrasures
have
been
faced
with
blocks
of
iron
three
feet
long
eight
inches
thick
and
twelve
inches
wide
i
saw
the
effect
of
a
heavy
shot
on
one
of
these
blocks
which
had
been
knocked
right
away
and
had
fallen
in
two
pieces
on
the
rocks
below
but
it
had
certainly
saved
the
embrasure
from
further
injury
that
time
i
saw
some
solid
shot
which
had
been
fired
by
the
enemy
they
weigh
lb
i
was
told
that
several
shell
had
stuck
in
the
walls
and
burst
there
tearing
away
great
flakes
of
masonry
and
making
holes
two
feet
deep
at
the
extreme
none
of
the
ironclads
would
approach
nearer
than
nine
hundred
yards
and
the
keokuk
which
was
the
only
one
that
came
thus
close
got
out
of
order
in
five
minutes
and
was
completely
disabled
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
sank
on
the
following
morning
solid
shot
and
were
used
upon
her
ripley
said
he
would
give
a
great
deal
for
some
more
guns
but
he
ca
get
them
except
by
such
chances
as
the
keokuk
the
fight
only
lasted
two
hours
and
minutes
fort
sumter
bore
nearly
the
whole
weight
of
the
attack
assisted
in
a
slight
degree
by
moultrie
only
one
man
was
killed
which
was
caused
by
the
fall
of
the
flagstaff
the
confederates
were
unable
to
believe
until
some
time
afterwards
the
real
amount
of
the
damage
they
had
inflicted
nor
did
they
discover
until
next
day
that
the
affair
was
a
serious
attack
and
not
a
reconnaissance
general
ripley
spoke
with
the
greatest
confidence
of
being
able
to
repulse
any
other
attack
of
the
same
sort
colonel
rhett
the
commandant
entertained
us
with
luncheon
in
one
of
the
casemates
he
is
a
handsome
and
agreeable
man
besides
being
a
zealous
officer
he
told
me
that
one
of
the
most
efficient
of
his
subordinates
was
captain
mitchell
son
to
the
irish
patriot
who
is
editor
of
one
of
the
richmond
newspapers
from
the
summit
of
fort
sumter
a
good
general
view
is
obtained
of
the
harbour
and
of
the
fortifications
commanding
the
approach
to
charleston
castle
pinckney
and
fort
sumter
are
two
old
masonry
works
built
on
islands
pinckney
being
much
closer
to
the
city
than
sumter
between
them
is
fort
ripley
which
mounts
heavy
guns
moultrieville
with
its
numerous
forts
called
battery
bee
fort
moultrie
fort
beauregard
is
on
sullivan
island
one
mile
distant
from
fort
sumter
there
are
excellent
arrangements
of
and
other
contrivances
to
foul
the
screw
of
a
vessel
between
sumter
and
moultrie
on
the
other
side
of
fort
sumter
is
fort
johnson
on
james
island
fort
cummins
point
and
fort
wagner
on
morris
island
in
fact
both
sides
of
the
harbour
for
several
miles
appear
to
bristle
with
forts
mounting
heavy
guns
the
bar
beyond
which
we
counted
thirteen
blockaders
is
nine
miles
from
the
city
sumter
is
three
and
a
half
miles
from
the
city
two
or
three
thousand
yankees
are
now
supposed
to
be
on
folly
island
which
is
next
beyond
morris
island
and
in
a
day
or
two
they
are
to
be
shelled
from
the
confederate
batteries
on
morris
island
the
new
confederate
flag
which
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
british
white
ensign
was
flying
from
most
of
the
forts
in
returning
we
passed
several
amongst
others
the
steamer
kate
with
the
new
double
screw
these
vessels
are
painted
the
same
colour
as
the
water
as
many
as
three
or
four
often
go
in
and
out
with
impunity
during
one
night
but
they
never
attempt
it
except
in
cloudy
weather
they
are
very
seldom
captured
and
charge
an
enormous
price
for
passengers
and
freight
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
traffic
of
the
private
does
do
more
harm
than
good
to
the
country
by
depreciating
its
currency
and
they
are
generally
looked
upon
as
regular
gambling
speculations
i
have
met
many
persons
who
are
of
opinion
that
the
trade
ought
to
be
stopped
except
for
government
stores
and
articles
necessary
for
the
public
welfare
after
we
had
landed
captain
feilden
took
me
on
board
one
of
the
new
ironclads
which
are
being
built
and
which
are
supposed
to
be
a
great
improvement
upon
the
chicora
and
palmetto
state
these
are
already
afloat
and
did
good
service
last
february
by
issuing
suddenly
forth
and
driving
away
the
whole
blockading
squadron
for
one
day
last
night
these
two
active
little
vessels
were
out
to
look
after
some
blockaders
which
were
supposed
to
have
ventured
inside
the
bar
at
i
dined
with
general
and
mrs
ripley
the
dinner
was
a
very
sumptuous
one
for
a
blockade
dinner
as
general
ripley
called
it
the
other
guests
were
general
jordan
chief
of
the
staff
to
beauregard
general
davis
mr
nutt
and
colonel
rhett
of
fort
sumter
the
latter
told
me
that
if
the
ironclads
had
come
any
closer
than
they
did
he
should
have
dosed
them
with
bolts
out
of
the
guns
which
he
thinks
could
travel
accurately
enough
for
or
yards
mrs
h
asked
me
to
an
evening
party
but
the
extreme
badness
of
my
clothes
compelled
me
to
decline
the
invitation
as
fort
sumter
must
be
in
a
very
different
state
now
to
what
it
was
when
i
saw
it
i
think
there
can
be
no
harm
in
describing
the
fort
as
it
then
nov
wednesday
i
dined
with
mr
and
mrs
h
this
afternoon
and
after
dinner
they
drove
me
to
the
battery
which
is
the
popular
promenade
a
great
many
people
and
a
few
carriages
were
there
but
the
h
s
say
it
is
nothing
to
what
it
was
most
of
the
horses
and
carriages
have
been
sent
out
of
charleston
since
the
last
attack
mrs
h
told
me
all
the
ladies
began
to
move
out
of
charleston
on
the
morning
after
the
repulse
of
the
monitors
the
impression
being
that
the
serious
attack
was
about
to
begin
i
talked
to
her
about
the
smart
costumes
of
the
negro
women
on
sundays
she
said
the
only
difference
between
them
and
their
mistresses
is
that
a
mulatto
woman
is
not
allowed
to
wear
a
veil
thursday
general
ripley
took
me
in
his
boat
to
morris
island
we
passed
fort
sumter
on
our
left
and
got
aground
for
five
minutes
in
its
immediate
neighbourhood
then
bearing
off
towards
the
right
we
passed
fort
cummins
point
and
after
entering
a
narrow
creek
fort
wagner
on
our
left
the
latter
is
a
powerful
mounting
nine
heavy
guns
and
it
completely
cuts
across
morris
island
at
the
end
nearest
to
fort
sumter
general
ripley
pointed
at
fort
wagner
with
some
pride
we
landed
near
the
house
of
the
colonel
who
commanded
the
troops
in
morris
island
and
borrowed
his
horses
to
ride
to
the
further
extremity
of
the
island
we
passed
the
wreck
of
the
keokuk
whose
turret
was
just
visible
above
the
water
at
a
distance
from
the
shore
of
about
yards
on
this
beach
i
also
inspected
the
remains
of
the
yankee
devil
a
curious
construction
which
on
the
day
of
the
attack
had
been
pushed
into
the
harbour
by
one
of
the
monitors
this
vessel
with
her
appendage
happened
to
be
the
first
to
receive
the
fire
of
fort
sumter
and
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
monitor
and
devil
got
foul
of
one
another
when
both
came
to
grief
and
the
latter
floated
harmlessly
ashore
it
seems
to
have
been
composed
of
double
beams
forming
a
sort
of
platform
or
stage
fifty
feet
long
by
twenty
broad
from
which
depended
chains
with
grappling
irons
to
rake
up
hostile
torpedoes
the
machine
was
also
provided
with
a
gigantic
torpedo
of
its
own
which
was
to
blow
up
piles
or
other
obstacles
morris
island
is
a
miserable
low
sandy
desert
and
at
its
further
extremity
there
is
a
range
of
low
sandhills
which
form
admirable
natural
parapets
about
ten
guns
and
mortars
were
placed
behind
them
and
two
companies
of
regular
artillery
were
stationed
at
this
point
under
the
command
of
captain
mitchell
the
patriot
son
to
whom
i
was
introduced
he
seemed
a
quiet
unassuming
man
and
was
spoken
of
by
general
ripley
as
an
excellent
officer
he
told
me
he
expected
to
be
able
to
open
fire
in
a
day
or
two
upon
the
yankees
in
folly
island
and
little
folly
and
he
expressed
a
hope
that
a
few
shell
might
drive
them
out
from
little
folly
which
is
only
distant
yards
from
his
guns
the
enemy
large
batteries
are
on
folly
island
yards
off
but
within
range
of
captain
mitchell
rifled
artillery
one
of
which
was
a
whitworth
a
named
the
ruby
deceived
by
some
lights
on
folly
island
ran
ashore
at
one
this
morning
in
the
narrow
inlet
between
morris
island
and
little
folly
the
yankees
immediately
opened
fire
on
her
and
her
crew
despairing
of
getting
her
off
set
her
on
fire
a
foolish
measure
as
she
was
right
under
captain
guns
and
whenever
a
group
of
yankees
approached
the
wreck
a
shell
was
placed
in
their
midst
which
effectually
checked
their
curiosity
the
ruby
was
therefore
burning
in
peace
her
crew
had
escaped
all
except
one
man
who
was
drowned
in
trying
to
save
a
valuable
trunk
after
having
conversed
some
time
with
captain
mitchell
and
his
brother
officers
we
took
leave
of
them
and
general
ripley
pursuing
his
tour
of
inspection
took
me
up
some
of
the
numerous
creeks
which
intersect
the
low
marshy
land
of
james
island
in
one
of
these
i
saw
the
shattered
remains
of
the
sham
keokuk
which
was
a
wooden
imitation
of
its
equally
original
and
had
been
used
as
a
floating
target
by
the
different
forts
in
passing
fort
sumter
i
observed
that
the
eastern
face
from
which
the
guns
except
those
had
been
removed
was
being
further
strengthened
by
a
facing
of
twelve
feet
of
sand
supported
by
logs
of
wood
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
sumter
could
be
destroyed
if
a
vessel
could
be
found
impervious
enough
to
lie
pretty
close
in
and
batter
it
for
five
hours
but
with
its
heavy
armament
and
plunging
fire
this
catastrophe
was
not
deemed
probable
general
ripley
told
me
that
in
his
opinion
the
proper
manner
to
attack
charleston
was
to
land
on
morris
island
take
forts
wagner
and
cummins
point
and
then
turn
their
guns
on
fort
sumter
he
does
not
think
much
of
the
guns
the
enemy
does
not
dare
use
more
than
lb
of
powder
to
propel
lb
of
iron
the
velocity
consequently
is
very
trifling
he
knows
and
admires
the
british
weighing
but
he
does
not
think
it
heavy
enough
effectually
to
destroy
ironclads
he
considers
the
gun
throwing
a
shot
of
as
the
most
efficient
for
that
purpose
in
returning
from
morris
island
we
passed
two
steamers
which
had
successfully
run
the
blockade
last
night
besides
the
luckless
ruby
which
had
also
passed
the
blockading
squadron
before
she
came
to
grief
the
names
of
the
other
two
are
the
anaconda
and
racoon
both
vessels
i
dined
at
mr
robertson
at
the
corner
of
rutledge
street
and
met
captain
tucker
of
the
navy
there
he
is
a
very
good
fellow
and
a
perfect
gentleman
he
commands
the
chicora
gunboat
and
it
was
he
who
with
his
own
and
another
gunboat
palmetto
state
crossed
the
bar
last
february
and
raised
the
blockade
for
a
few
hours
he
told
me
that
several
yankee
blockaders
surrendered
but
could
not
be
taken
possession
of
and
the
others
bolted
at
such
a
pace
as
to
render
pursuit
hopeless
for
these
little
gunboats
are
very
slow
they
made
the
attack
at
daylight
and
though
much
fired
at
were
never
struck
they
seem
to
have
taken
the
yankees
by
surprise
and
to
have
created
great
alarm
but
at
that
time
the
blockading
squadron
consisted
entirely
of
improvised
since
this
exploit
the
frigate
ironsides
and
the
sloop
of
war
powhattan
have
been
added
to
its
strength
it
poured
with
rain
during
the
evening
and
we
had
a
violent
thunderstorm
general
beauregard
returned
to
charleston
this
afternoon
this
must
have
been
about
the
spot
from
whence
fort
sumter
was
afterwards
bombarded
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
confederates
made
a
great
mistake
in
not
fortifying
the
further
end
of
morris
island
and
keeping
a
larger
garrison
there
for
when
the
federals
landed
they
met
with
no
fortification
until
they
reached
fort
wagner
friday
i
called
at
an
exchange
office
this
morning
and
asked
the
value
of
gold
they
offered
me
six
to
one
for
it
i
went
to
a
slave
auction
at
but
they
had
been
so
quick
about
it
that
the
whole
affair
was
over
before
i
arrived
although
i
was
only
ten
minutes
late
the
negroes
about
fifteen
men
three
women
and
three
children
were
seated
on
benches
looking
perfectly
contented
and
indifferent
i
saw
the
buyers
opening
the
mouths
and
showing
the
teeth
of
their
new
purchases
to
their
friends
in
a
very
manner
this
was
certainly
not
a
very
agreeable
spectacle
to
an
englishman
and
i
know
that
many
southerners
participate
in
the
same
feeling
for
i
have
often
been
told
by
people
that
they
had
never
seen
a
negro
sold
by
auction
and
never
wished
to
do
so
it
is
impossible
to
mention
names
in
connection
with
such
a
subject
but
i
am
perfectly
aware
that
many
influential
men
in
the
south
feel
humiliated
and
annoyed
with
several
of
the
incidents
connected
with
slavery
and
i
think
that
if
the
confederate
states
were
the
system
would
be
much
modified
and
amended
although
complete
emancipation
can
not
be
expected
for
the
southerners
believe
it
to
be
as
impracticable
to
cultivate
cotton
on
a
large
scale
in
the
south
without
forced
black
labour
as
the
british
have
found
it
to
produce
sugar
in
jamaica
and
they
declare
that
the
example
the
english
have
set
them
of
sudden
emancipation
in
that
island
is
by
no
means
encouraging
they
say
that
that
magnificent
colony
formerly
so
wealthy
and
prosperous
is
now
nearly
valueless
the
land
going
out
of
cultivation
the
whites
ruined
the
blacks
idle
slothful
and
supposed
to
be
in
a
great
measure
relapsing
into
their
primitive
barbarism
at
i
called
by
appointment
on
captain
tucker
on
board
the
chicora
the
accommodation
below
is
good
considering
the
nature
and
peculiar
shape
of
the
vessel
but
in
hot
weather
the
quarters
are
very
close
and
unhealthy
for
which
reason
she
is
moored
alongside
a
wharf
on
which
her
crew
live
captain
tucker
expressed
great
confidence
in
his
vessel
during
calm
weather
and
when
not
exposed
to
a
plunging
fire
he
said
he
should
not
hesitate
to
attack
even
the
present
blockading
squadron
if
it
were
not
for
certain
reasons
which
he
explained
to
me
captain
tucker
expects
great
results
from
certain
submarine
inventions
which
he
thinks
are
sure
to
succeed
he
told
me
that
in
the
april
attack
these
two
gunboats
were
placed
in
rear
of
fort
sumter
and
if
as
was
anticipated
the
monitors
had
managed
to
force
their
way
past
sumter
they
would
have
been
received
from
different
directions
by
the
powerful
battery
bee
on
sullivan
island
by
this
island
forts
pinckney
and
ripley
by
the
two
gunboats
and
by
fort
johnson
on
james
island
a
nest
of
hornets
from
which
they
would
perhaps
never
have
returned
at
i
called
on
general
beauregard
who
is
a
man
of
middle
height
about
years
of
age
he
would
be
very
youthful
in
appearance
were
it
not
for
the
colour
of
his
hair
which
is
much
greyer
than
his
earlier
photographs
represent
some
persons
account
for
the
sudden
manner
in
which
his
hair
turned
grey
by
allusions
to
his
cares
and
anxieties
during
the
last
two
years
but
the
real
and
less
romantic
reason
is
to
be
found
in
the
rigidity
of
the
yankee
blockade
which
interrupts
the
arrival
of
articles
of
toilette
he
has
a
long
straight
nose
handsome
brown
eyes
and
a
dark
mustache
without
whiskers
and
his
manners
are
extremely
polite

is
a
new
orleans
creole
and
french
is

native
language
illustration
general
t
beauregard
he
was
extremely
civil
to
me
and
arranged
that
i
should
see
some
of
the
land
fortifications
he
spoke
to
me
of
the
inevitable
necessity
sooner
or
later
of
a
war
between
the
northern
states
and
great
britain
and
he
remarked
that
if
england
would
join
the
south
at
once
the
southern
armies
relieved
of
the
present
blockade
and
enormous
yankee
pressure
would
be
able
to
march
right
into
the
northern
states
and
by
occupying
their
principal
cities
would
give
the
yankees
so
much
employment
that
they
would
be
unable
to
spare
many
men
for
canada
he
acknowledged
that
in
mississippi
general
grant
had
displayed
uncommon
vigour
and
met
with
considerable
success
considering
that
he
was
a
man
of
no
great
military
capacity
he
said
that
johnston
was
certainly
acting
slowly
and
with
much
caution
but
then
he
had
not
the
veteran
troops
of
bragg
or
lee
he
told
me
that
he
beauregard
had
organised
both
the
virginian
and
tennessean
armies
both
are
composed
of
the
same
materials
both
have
seen
much
service
though
on
the
whole
the
first
had
been
the
most
severely
tried
he
said
that
in
the
confederate
organisation
a
brigade
is
composed
of
four
regiments
a
division
ought
to
number
men
and
a
but
i
know
that
neither
polk
nor
hardee
have
got
anything
like
that
number
at
the
firing
on
morris
island
became
distinctly
audible
captain
mitchell
had
evidently
commenced
his
operations
against
little
folly
whilst
i
was
walking
on
the
battery
this
evening
a
gentleman
came
up
to
me
and
recalled
himself
to
my
recollection
as
mr
meyers
of
the
sumter
whom
i
had
known
at
gibraltar
a
year
ago
this
was
one
of
the
two
persons
who
were
arrested
at
tangier
by
the
acting
united
states
consul
in
such
an
outrageous
manner
he
told
me
that
he
had
been
kept
in
irons
during
his
whole
voyage
in
the
merchant
vessel
to
the
united
states
and
in
spite
of
the
total
illegality
of
his
capture
on
neutral
ground
he
was
imprisoned
for
four
months
in
fort
warren
and
not
released
until
regularly
exchanged
as
a
prisoner
of
war
mr
meyers
was
now
most
anxious
to
rejoin
captain
semmes
or
some
other
rover
i
understand
that
when
the
attack
took
place
in
april
the
garrison
of
fort
sumter
received
the
monitors
with
great
courtesy
as
they
steamed
up
the
three
flagstaffs
were
dressed
with
flags
the
band
from
the
top
of
the
fort
played
the
national
airs
and
a
salute
of
guns
was
fired
after
which
the
entertainment
provided
was
of
a
more
solid
description
i
have
omitted
a
description
of
this
little
gunboat
as
she
is
still
doing
good
service
in
charleston
harbour
november
a
division
does
nearly
always
number
men
but
then
there
are
generally
only
two
or
three
divisions
in
a
saturday
colonel
rice
to
general
beauregard
rode
with
me
to
secessionville
this
morning
i
was
mounted
on
the
horse
which
the
general
rode
at
manassas
and
shiloh
we
reached
james
island
by
crossing
the
long
wooden
bridge
which
spans
the
river
ashley
the
land
of
james
island
is
low
and
marshy
and
is
both
by
repute
and
in
appearance
most
unhealthy
three
years
ago
no
white
men
would
have
dreamed
of
occupying
it
at
this
time
of
year
but
now
that
the
necessity
has
arisen
the
troops
curiously
enough
do
not
appear
to
suffer
secessionville
the
most
advanced
and
most
important
of
the
james
island
fortifications
is
distant
by
road
eight
miles
from
charleston
bridge
with
which
it
is
connected
by
a
chain
of
forts
it
was
surprised
by
the
enemy
just
a
year
ago
june
and
was
the
scene
of
a
desperate
conflict
which
resulted
in
the
repulse
of
the
federals
with
a
loss
of
nearly
men
the
confederates
lost
men
on
this
occasion
which
as
yet
has
been
the
only
serious
loss
of
life
at
charleston
during
the
war
colonel
lamar
who
commanded
the
garrison
with
great
gallantry
was
one
of
the
few
victims
to
yellow
fever
last
year
the
yankees
attacked
the
fort
three
times
with
much
bravery
and
determination
and
actually
reached
the
superior
slope
of
the
parapet
before
they
were
driven
back
they
were
within
an
ace
of
being
successful
and
although
they
deserved
great
credit
for
their
behaviour
on
that
occasion
yet
it
is
understood
that
the
officer
who
organised
the
attack
has
either
been
dismissed
the
service
or
otherwise
punished
brown
the
commandant
who
showed
me
over
the
fort
and
is
quite
young
full
of
zeal
and
most
anxious
to
be
attacked
he
has
artillerymen
to
man
this
and
the
neighbouring
works
and
two
regiments
of
infantry
are
also
encamped
within
a
short
distance
at
the
time
of
the
attack
on
charleston
last
april
there
were
men
to
defend
it
since
that
time
had
been
sent
into
mississippi
to
reinforce
johnston
i
imagine
that
as
the
fortifications
are
so
very
extensive
the
charleston
garrison
ought
to
consist
of
at
least
men
sunday
i
went
to
church
at
st
michael
which
is
one
of
the
oldest
churches
in
america
and
is
supposed
to
have
been
built
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
the
charlestonians
are
very
proud
of
it
and
i
saw
several
monuments
of
the
time
of
the
british
dominion
this
morning
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
mr
sennec
an
officer
in
the
confederate
states
navy
who
with
his
wife
and
daughter
were
about
to
face
the
terrors
and
dangers
of
running
the
blockade
mr
sennec
having
got
an
appointment
in
europe
the
ladies
told
me
they
had
already
made
one
start
but
after
reaching
the
bar
the
night
was
not
considered
propitious
so
they
had
returned
mr
sennec
is
thinking
of
going
to
wilmington
and
running
from
thence
as
it
is
more
secure
than
charleston
i
dined
at
mr
robertson
this
evening
and
met
a
very
agreeable
party
there
two
young
ladies
who
were
extremely
pretty
general
beauregard
captain
tucker
of
the
chicora
and
major
norris
the
chief
of
the
secret
intelligence
bureau
at
richmond
i
had
a
long
conversation
with
general
beauregard
who
said
he
considered
the
question
of
ironclads
forts
as
settled
especially
when
the
fire
from
the
latter
is
plunging
if
the
other
monitors
had
approached
as
close
as
the
keokuk
they
would
probably
have
shared
her
fate
he
thought
that
both
rifled
bolts
and
solid
balls
penetrated
the
ironclads
when
within
yards
he
agreed
with
general
ripley
that
the
gun
is
rather
a
failure
it
is
so
unwieldy
that
it
can
only
be
fired
very
slowly
and
the
velocity
of
the
ball
is
so
small
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
strike
a
moving
object
he
told
me
that
fort
sumter
was
to
be
covered
by
degrees
with
the
long
green
moss
which
in
this
country
hangs
down
from
the
trees
he
thinks
that
when
this
is
pressed
it
will
deaden
the
effect
of
the
shot
without
being
inflammable
and
he
also
said
that
even
if
the
walls
of
fort
sumter
were
battered
down
the
barbette
battery
would
still
remain
supported
on
the
piers
the
federal
frigate
ironsides
took
up
her
position
during
the
attack
over
lb
of
powder
which
was
prevented
from
exploding
owing
to
some
misfortune
connected
with
the
communicating
wire
general
beauregard
and
captain
tucker
both
seemed
to
expect
great
things
from
a
and
after
dinner
major
norris
showed
us
a
copy
of
a
new
york
illustrated
newspaper
of
the
same
character
as
our
in
it
the
president
davis
and
general
beauregard
were
depicted
shoeless
and
in
rags
contemplating
a
pair
of
boots
which
the
latter
suggested
had
better
be
eaten
this
caricature
excited
considerable
amusement
especially
when
its
merits
were
discussed
after
mr
robertson
excellent
dinner
general
beauregard
told
me
he
had
been
educated
in
the
north
and
used
to
have
many
friends
there
but
that
he
would
sooner
submit
to
the
emperor
of
china
than
return
to
the
union
mr
walter
blake
arrived
soon
after
dinner
he
had
come
up
from
his
plantation
on
the
combahee
river
on
purpose
to
see
me
he
described
the
results
of
the
late
yankee
raid
up
that
river
forty
armed
negroes
and
a
few
whites
in
a
miserable
steamer
were
able
to
destroy
and
burn
an
incalculable
amount
of
property
and
carry
off
hundreds
of
negroes
mr
blake
got
off
very
cheap
having
only
lost
this
time
but
he
only
saved
the
remainder
by
his
own
personal
exertions
and
determination
he
had
now
sent
all
his
young
males
two
hundred
miles
into
the
interior
for
greater
safety
he
seemed
to
have
a
very
rough
time
of
it
living
all
alone
in
that
pestilential
climate
a
neighbouring
planter
mr
lowndes
had
lost
negroes
and
a
mr
kirkland
was
totally
ruined
at
mr
blake
and
i
called
at
the
office
of
general
ripley
to
whom
mr
blake
notwithstanding
that
he
is
an
englishman
of
nearly
sixty
years
of
age
had
served
as
during
some
of
the
former
operations
against
charleston
general
ripley
told
us
that
shelling
was
still
going
on
vigorously
between
morris
and
folly
islands
the
yankees
being
assisted
every
now
and
then
by
one
or
more
of
their
gunboats
the
general
explained
to
us
that
these
armed
vessels
as
he
called
them
were
indefatigable
at
pushing
up
the
numerous
creeks
burning
and
devastating
everything
he
said
that
when
he
became
acquainted
with
the
habits
of
one
of
these
critturs
he
arranged
an
ambuscade
for
her
and
with
the
assistance
of
his
fancy
irishman
captain
mitchell
he
captured
her
this
was
the
case
with
the
steamer
stono
a
short
time
since
which
having
been
caught
in
this
manner
by
the
army
was
lost
by
the
navy
shortly
afterwards
off
sullivan
island
news
has
just
been
received
that
commodore
foote
is
to
succeed
dupont
in
the
command
of
the
blockading
squadron
most
of
these
officers
appeared
to
rejoice
in
this
change
as
they
say
foote
is
younger
and
likely
to
show
more
sport
than
the
venerable
dupont
monday
i
called
on
general
beauregard
to
say
before
parting
he
told
me
that
his
official
orders
both
from
the
government
and
from
the
were
that
he
was
to
allow
charleston
to
be
laid
in
ashes
sooner
than
surrender
it
the
confederates
being
unanimous
in
their
determination
that
whatever
happened
the
capital
of
south
carolina
should
never
have
to
submit
to
the
fate
of
new
orleans
but
general
beauregard
did
not
at
all
anticipate
that
such
an
alternative
was
imminent
in
answer
to
my
thanks
for
his
kindness
and
courtesy
he
said
that
the
more
europeans
that
came
to
the
south
the
more
the
southerners
were
pleased
as
was
the
only
way
to
remove
many
prejudices
he
declared
everything
here
was
open
and
above
board
and
i
really
believe
this
is
the
case
most
certainly
the
civil
law
is
not
overruled
by
the
military
except
in
cases
of
the
strongest
emergency
the
press
is
allowed
the
most
unlimited
freedom
and
even
licence
whenever
excesses
take
place
and
the
law
is
violated
this
is
caused
by
the
violence
of
the
people
themselves
who
take
the
law
into
their
own
hands
general
beauregard
sent
his
love
to
sir
james
fergusson
who
had
visited
him
during
the
early
part
of
the
war
so
also
did
general
jordan
chief
of
the
staff
before
taking
my
departure
from
the
hotel
i
was
much
gratified
by
meeting
who
had
just
returned
from
richmond
he
had
had
the
good
fortune
to
cross
the
mississippi
a
little
later
than
me
and
he
had
encountered
comparatively
few
obstacles
i
left
charleston
by
rail
at
in
company
with
mr
sennec
his
wife
and
daughter
and
major
norris
who
was
extremely
kind
and
useful
to
me
i
declined
travelling
in
the
ladies
car
although
offered
that
privilege
the
advantage
of
a
small
amount
of
extra
cleanliness
being
outweighed
by
the
screaming
of
the
children
and
the
constant
liability
of
being
turned
out
of
one
place
for
a
female
major
norris
told
me
many
amusing
anecdotes
connected
with
the
secret
intelligence
department
and
of
the
numerous
ingenious
methods
for
communicating
with
the
southern
partisans
on
the
other
side
of
the
potomac
we
reached
florence
at
where
we
were
detained
for
some
time
owing
to
a
of
another
train
we
then
fought
our
way
into
some
desperately
crowded
cars
and
continued
our
journey
throughout
the
night
tuesday
arrived
at
wilmington
at
and
crossed
the
river
there
in
a
steamer
this
river
was
quite
full
of
i
counted
eight
large
steamers
all
handsome
vessels
which
ply
their
trade
with
the
greatest
regularity
half
these
ships
were
engaged
in
carrying
goods
on
government
account
and
i
was
told
that
the
quantity
of
boots
clothing
saltpetre
lead
and
tin
which
they
bring
into
the
country
is
very
great
i
can
not
suppose
that
in
ordinary
times
there
would
be
anything
like
such
a
trade
as
this
at
a
little
place
like
wilmington
which
shows
the
absurdity
of
calling
the
blockade
an
efficient
one
this
is
an
extraordinary
instance
of
british
energy
and
enterprise
when
i
was
at
charleston
i
asked
mr
robertson
whether
any
french
vessels
had
run
the
blockade
in
reply
he
told
me
it
was
a
very
peculiar
fact
that
one
of
the
partners
of
fraser
being
a
frenchman
was
extremely
anxious
to
engage
a
french
vessel
in
the
trade
expense
was
no
object
the
ship
and
the
cargo
were
forthcoming
nothing
was
wanted
but
a
french
captain
and
a
french
crew
to
make
the
ship
legally
french
but
although
any
amount
of
money
was
offered
as
an
inducement
they
were
not
to
be
found
and
this
obstacle
was
insurmountable
not
the
slightest
difficulty
is
experienced
at
liverpool
in
officering
and
manning
any
number
of
ships
for
this
purpose
major
norris
went
to
call
upon
mr
vallandigham
whom
he
had
escorted
to
wilmington
as
a
sort
of
some
days
ago
mr
vallandigham
was
in
bed
he
told
major
norris
that
he
intended
to
run
the
blockade
this
evening
for
bermuda
from
whence
he
should
find
his
way
to
the
clifton
hotel
canada
where
he
intended
to
publish
a
newspaper
and
agitate
ohio
across
the
frontier
major
norris
found
him
much
elated
by
the
news
of
his
having
been
nominated
for
the
governorship
of
ohio
and
he
declared
if
he
was
duly
elected
his
state
could
dictate
peace
in
travelling
through
the
country
to
wilmington
these
two
used
to
converse
much
on
politics
and
major
norris
once
said
to
him
now
from
what
you
have
seen
and
heard
in
your
journey
through
the
south
you
must
know
that
a
reconstruction
of
the
old
union
under
any
circumstances
is
utterly
impossible
vallandigham
had
replied
well
all
i
can
say
is
and
at
all
events
i
know
that
my
scheme
of
a
suspension
of
hostilities
is
the
only
one
which
has
any
prospect
of
ultimate
success
at
wilmington
i
took
leave
with
regret
of
mr
sennec
and
his
family
who
were
also
to
run
the
blockade
this
evening
miss
sennec
is
much
too
pretty
to
risk
a
collision
with
a
fragment
of
a
shell
but
here
no
one
seems
to
think
anything
of
the
risk
of
passing
through
the
yankee
fleet
as
the
runners
though
often
fired
at
are
very
seldom
hit
or
captured
and
their
captains
are
becoming
more
and
more
knowing
every
day
i
was
obliged
to
go
to
the
office
to
get
beauregard
pass
renewed
there
as
north
carolina
is
out
of
his
district
in
doing
so
i
very
nearly
missed
the
train
i
left
wilmington
at
the
weather
was
very
hot
and
oppressive
and
the
cars
dreadfully
crowded
all
day
the
luxuries
of
charleston
had
also
spoiled
me
for
the
road
as
i
could
no
longer
appreciate
at
their
proper
value
the
hog
and
hominy
meals
which
i
had
been
so
thankful
for
in
texas
but
i
found
major
norris
a
very
agreeable
and
instructive
companion
we
changed
cars
again
at
weldon
where
i
had
a
terrific
fight
for
a
seat
but
i
succeeded
for
experience
had
made
me
very
quick
at
this
sort
of
business
i
always
carry
my
saddlebags
and
knapsack
with
me
into
the
car
i
have
often
heard
southerners
speak
of
this
proposal
of
vallandigham
as
and
dangerous
but
the
opinion
now
is
that
things
have
gone
too
far
to
permit
reunion
under
any
circumstances
wednesday
we
reached
petersburgh
at
and
had
to
get
out
and
traverse
this
town
in
carts
after
which
we
had
to
lie
down
in
the
road
until
some
other
cars
were
opened
we
left
petersburgh
at
and
arrived
at
richmond
at
having
taken
hours
coming
from
charleston
the
railroad
between
petersburgh
and
richmond
is
protected
by
extensive
and
the
woods
have
been
cut
down
to
give
range
an
irruption
of
the
enemy
in
this
direction
has
evidently
been
contemplated
and
we
met
a
brigade
of
infantry
between
petersburgh
and
richmond
on
its
way
to
garrison
the
latter
place
as
the
yankees
are
reported
to
be
menacing
in
that
neighbourhood
the
scenery
near
richmond
is
very
pretty
and
rather
the
view
of
the
james
river
from
the
railway
bridge
is
quite
beautiful
though
the
water
is
rather
low
at
present
the
weather
was
extremely
hot
and
oppressive
and
for
the
first
time
since
i
left
havana
i
really
suffered
from
the
heat
at
i
called
on
general
cooper
to
the
confederate
forces
and
senior
general
in
the
army
he
is
to
mr
mason
the
southern
commissioner
in
london
i
then
called
upon
mr
benjamin
the
secretary
of
state
who
made
an
appointment
with
me
to
meet
him
at
his
house
at
the
public
offices
are
handsome
stone
buildings
and
seemed
to
be
well
arranged
for
business
i
found
at
least
as
much
difficulty
in
gaining
access
to
the
great
men
as
there
would
be
in
european
countries
but
when
once
admitted
i
was
treated
with
the
greatest
courtesy
the
anterooms
were
crowded
with
people
patiently
waiting
for
an
audience
the
streets
of
richmond
are
named
and
numbered
in
a
most
puzzling
manner
and
the
greater
part
of
the
houses
are
not
numbered
at
all
it
is
the
most
hilly
city
i
have
seen
in
america
and
its
population
is
unnaturally
swollen
since
the
commencement
of
the
war
the
fact
of
there
being
abundance
of
ice
appeared
to
me
an
immense
luxury
as
i
had
never
seen
any
before
in
the
south
but
it
seems
that
the
winters
are
quite
severe
in
northern
virginia
i
was
sorry
to
hear
in
the
highest
quarters
the
gloomiest
forebodings
with
regard
to
the
fate
of
vicksburg
this
fortress
is
in
fact
and
all
now
despair
of
general
johnston
being
able
to
effect
anything
towards
its
relief
i
kept
my
appointment
with
mr
benjamin
at
he
is
a
stout
dapper
little
man
evidently
of
hebrew
extraction
and
of
undoubted
talent
he
is
a
louisianian
and
was
senator
for
that
state
in
the
old
united
states
congress
and
i
believe
he
is
accounted
a
very
clever
lawyer
and
a
brilliant
orator
he
told
me
that
he
had
filled
the
onerous
post
of
secretary
of
war
during
the
first
seven
months
of
the
secession
and
i
can
easily
believe
that
he
found
it
no
sinecure
we
conversed
for
a
long
time
about
the
origin
of
secession
which
he
indignantly
denied
was
brought
about
as
the
yankees
assert
by
the
interested
machinations
of
individuals
he
declared
that
for
the
last
ten
years
the
southern
statesmen
had
openly
stated
in
congress
what
would
take
place
but
the
northerners
never
would
believe
they
were
in
earnest
and
had
often
replied
by
the
taunt
the
south
was
so
bound
to
and
dependent
on
the
north
that
could
be
kicked
out
of
the
he
said
that
the
southern
armies
had
always
been
immensely
outnumbered
in
all
their
battles
and
that
until
recently
general
lee
could
never
muster
more
than
effective
men
he
confessed
that
the
southern
forces
consisted
altogether
of
about
to
men
and
when
i
asked
him
where
they
all
were
he
replied
that
on
account
of
the
enormous
tract
of
country
to
be
defended
and
the
immense
advantages
the
enemy
possessed
by
his
facilities
for
sea
and
river
transportation
the
south
was
obliged
to
keep
large
bodies
of
men
unemployed
and
at
great
distances
from
each
other
awaiting
the
sudden
invasions
or
raids
to
which
they
were
continually
exposed
besides
which
the
northern
troops
which
numbered
he
supposed
men
having
had
as
yet
but
little
defensive
warfare
could
all
be
employed
for
aggressive
purposes
he
asserted
that
england
has
still
and
always
had
had
it
in
her
power
to
terminate
the
war
by
recognition
and
by
making
a
commercial
treaty
with
the
south
and
he
denied
that
the
yankees
really
would
dare
to
go
to
war
with
great
britain
for
doing
so
however
much
they
might
swagger
about
it
he
said
that
recognition
would
not
increase
the
yankee
hatred
of
england
for
this
whether
just
or
unjust
was
already
as
intense
as
it
could
possibly
be
i
then
alluded
to
the
supposed
ease
with
which
they
could
overrun
canada
and
to
the
temptation
which
its
unprotected
towns
must
offer
to
the
large
numbers
of
irish
and
german
mercenaries
in
the
northern
armies
he
answered
they
probably
could
not
do
that
so
easily
as
some
people
suppose
and
they
know
perfectly
well
that
you
could
deprive
them
of
california
a
far
more
serious
loss
with
much
greater
ease
this
consideration
together
with
the
certainty
of
an
entire
blockade
of
their
ports
the
total
destruction
of
their
trade
and
an
invasion
on
a
large
scale
by
the
southern
troops
in
reality
prevents
the
possibility
of
their
declaring
war
upon
england
at
the
present
time
any
more
than
they
did
at
the
period
of
their
great
national
humiliation
in
the
affair
mr
benjamin
told
me
that
his
property
had
lately
been
confiscated
in
new
orleans
and
that
his
two
sisters
had
been
turned
neck
and
crop
into
the
streets
there
with
only
one
trunk
which
they
had
been
forced
to
carry
themselves
every
one
was
afraid
to
give
them
shelter
except
an
englishwoman
who
protected
them
until
they
could
be
got
out
of
the
city
talking
of
the
just
admiration
which
the
english
newspapers
accorded
to
stonewall
jackson
he
expressed
however
his
astonishment
that
they
should
have
praised
so
highly
his
strategic
skill
in
outmanoeuvring
pope
at
manassas
and
hooker
at
chancellorsville
totally
ignoring
that
in
both
cases
the
movements
were
planned
and
ordered
by
general
lee
for
whom
mr
benjamin
said
jackson
had
the
most
childlike
reverence
mr
benjamin
complained
of
mr
russell
of
the
for
holding
him
up
to
fame
as
a
gambler
a
story
which
he
understood
mr
russell
had
learnt
from
mr
charles
sumner
at
washington
but
even
supposing
that
this
was
really
the
case
mr
benjamin
was
of
opinion
that
such
a
revelation
of
his
private
life
was
in
extremely
bad
taste
after
mr
russell
had
partaken
of
his
mr
benjamin
hospitality
at
mongomery
he
said
the
confederates
were
more
amused
than
annoyed
at
the
term
rebel
which
was
so
constantly
applied
to
them
but
he
only
wished
mildly
to
remark
that
in
order
to
be
a
rebel
a
person
must
rebel
against
some
one
who
has
a
right
to
govern
him
and
he
thought
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
discover
such
a
right
as
existing
in
the
northern
over
the
southern
states
in
order
to
prepare
a
treaty
of
peace
he
said
it
would
only
be
necessary
to
write
on
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
the
words
let
the
yankees
accord
that
and
they
might
fill
up
the
paper
in
any
manner
they
chose
we
do
want
any
state
that
want
us
but
we
only
wish
that
each
state
should
decide
fairly
upon
its
own
destiny
all
we
are
struggling
for
is
to
be
let
alone
at
mr
benjamin
walked
with
me
to
the
president
dwelling
which
is
a
private
house
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
i
had
tea
there
and
uncommonly
good
tea
too
the
first
i
had
tasted
in
the
confederacy
mrs
davis
was
unfortunately
unwell
and
unable
to
see
me
mr
jefferson
davis
struck
me
as
looking
older
than
i
expected
he
is
only
but
his
face
is
emaciated
and
much
wrinkled
he
is
nearly
six
feet
high
but
is
extremely
thin
and
stoops
a
little
his
features
are
good
especially
his
eye
which
is
very
bright
and
full
of
life
and
humour
i
was
afterwards
told
he
had
lost
the
sight
of
his
left
eye
from
a
recent
illness
he
wore
a
linen
coat
and
grey
trousers
and
he
looked
what
he
evidently
is
a
gentleman
nothing
can
exceed
the
charm
of
his
manner
which
is
simple
easy
and
most
fascinating
he
conversed
with
me
for
a
long
time
and
agreed
with
benjamin
that
the
yankees
did
not
really
intend
to
go
to
war
with
england
if
she
recognised
the
south
and
he
said
that
when
the
inevitable
smash
came
and
that
separation
was
an
accomplished
fact
the
state
of
maine
would
probably
try
to
join
canada
as
most
of
the
intelligent
people
in
that
state
have
a
horror
of
being
the
thumb
of
he
added
that
maine
was
inhabited
by
a
hardy
thrifty
seafaring
population
with
different
ideas
to
the
people
in
the
other
new
england
states
when
i
spoke
to
him
of
the
wretched
scenes
i
had
witnessed
in
his
own
state
mississippi
and
of
the
miserable
almost
desperate
situation
in
which
i
had
found
so
many
unfortunate
women
who
had
been
left
behind
by
their
male
relations
and
when
i
alluded
in
admiration
to
the
quiet
calm
uncomplaining
manner
in
which
they
bore
their
sufferings
and
their
grief
he
said
with
much
feeling
that
he
always
considered
the
most
painful
description
of
misery
to
witness
in
the
same
way
that
he
thought
was
the
most
awful
form
of
madness
he
spoke
to
me
of
grenfell
who
he
said
seemed
to
be
serving
the
confederacy
in
a
disinterested
and
loyal
manner
he
had
heard
much
of
his
gallantry
and
good
services
and
he
was
very
sorry
when
i
told
him
of
grenfell
quarrel
with
the
civil
power
he
confirmed
the
truth
of
my
remark
that
a
confederate
general
is
either
considered
an
admirable
crichton
by
the
soldiers
or
else
abused
as
everything
bad
and
he
added
the
misfortune
was
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
in
order
to
insure
success
that
a
general
must
obtain
and
preserve
this
popularity
and
influence
with
his
men
who
were
however
generally
very
willing
to
accord
their
confidence
to
any
officer
deserving
of
it
with
regard
to
the
agitation
he
said
people
would
talk
a
great
deal
and
even
go
into
action
determined
to
give
no
quarter
but
he
added
i
have
yet
to
hear
of
confederate
soldiers
putting
men
to
death
who
have
thrown
down
their
arms
and
held
up
their
hands
he
told
me
that
lord
russell
confessed
that
the
impartial
carrying
out
of
the
neutrality
laws
had
pressed
hard
upon
the
south
and
mr
davis
asserted
that
the
pressure
might
have
been
equalised
and
yet
retained
its
impartiality
if
great
britain
instead
of
closing
her
ports
had
opened
them
to
the
prizes
of
both
parties
but
i
answered
that
perhaps
this
might
be
it
a
little
on
the
other
side
when
i
took
my
leave
about
the
president
asked
me
to
call
upon
him
again
i
do
think
it
is
possible
for
any
one
to
have
an
interview
with
him
without
going
away
most
favourably
impressed
by
his
agreeable
unassuming
manners
and
by
the
charm
of
his
conversation
whilst
walking
home
mr
benjamin
told
me
that
mr
davis
military
instincts
still
predominate
and
that
his
eager
wish
was
to
have
joined
the
army
instead
of
being
elected
president
during
my
travels
many
people
have
remarked
to
me
that
jefferson
davis
seems
in
a
peculiar
manner
adapted
for
his
office
his
military
education
at
west
point
rendered
him
intimately
acquainted
with
the
higher
officers
of
the
army
and
his
post
of
secretary
of
war
under
the
old
government
brought
officers
of
all
ranks
under
his
immediate
personal
knowledge
and
supervision
no
man
could
have
formed
a
more
accurate
estimate
of
their
respective
merits
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
which
gave
the
confederates
such
an
immense
start
in
the
way
of
generals
for
having
formed
his
opinion
with
regard
to
appointing
an
officer
mr
davis
is
always
most
determined
to
carry
out
his
intention
in
spite
of
every
obstacle
his
services
in
the
mexican
war
gave
him
the
prestige
of
a
brave
man
and
a
good
soldier
his
services
as
a
statesman
pointed
him
out
as
the
only
man
who
by
his
unflinching
determination
and
administrative
talent
was
able
to
control
the
popular
will
people
speak
of
any
misfortune
happening
to
him
as
an
irreparable
evil
too
dreadful
to
contemplate
before
we
reached
the
spottswood
hotel
we
met
to
whom
mr
benjamin
introduced
me
they
discussed
the
great
topic
of
the
day
the
recapture
of
winchester
by
general
ewell
the
news
of
which
had
just
arrived
and
they
both
expressed
their
regret
that
general
milroy
should
have
escaped
it
appears
that
this
yankee
commander
for
his
alleged
crimes
had
been
put
de
la
by
the
confederates
in
the
same
manner
as
general
butler
said
to
me
we
hope
he
may
not
be
taken
alive
but
if
he
is
we
will
not
shrink
from
the
responsibility
of
putting
him
to
death
thursday
at
i
called
by
appointment
on
mr
sedden
the
secretary
at
war
his
anteroom
was
crowded
with
applicants
for
an
interview
and
i
had
no
slight
difficulty
in
getting
in
mr
sedden
is
a
cadaverous
but
man
he
received
me
with
great
kindness
and
immediately
furnished
me
with
letters
of
introduction
for
generals
lee
and
longstreet
my
friend
major
norris
then
took
me
to
the
president
office
and
introduced
me
to
the
of
the
president
colonels
wood
lee
and
johnston
the
two
latter
are
sons
to
general
lee
and
general
albert
sidney
johnston
who
was
killed
at
shiloh
major
norris
then
took
me
to
the
capitol
and
introduced
me
to
mr
thompson
the
librarian
and
to
mr
meyers
who
is
now
supposed
to
look
after
british
interests
since
the
abrupt
departure
of
mr
moore
the
consul
i
was
told
that
mr
moore
had
always
been
considered
a
good
friend
to
the
southern
cause
and
had
got
into
the
mess
which
caused
his
removal
entirely
by
his
want
of
tact
and
discretion
there
is
a
fine
view
from
the
top
of
the
capitol
the
librarian
told
me
that
last
year
the
fighting
before
richmond
could
easily
be
seen
from
thence
and
that
many
ladies
used
to
go
up
for
that
purpose
every
one
said
that
notwithstanding
the
imminence
of
the
danger
the
population
of
richmond
continued
their
daily
avocations
and
that
no
alarm
was
felt
as
to
the
result
the
interior
of
the
capitol
is
decorated
with
numerous
flags
captured
from
the
enemy
they
are
very
gorgeous
all
silk
and
gold
and
form
a
great
contrast
to
the
little
bunting
battle
flags
of
the
confederates
amongst
them
i
saw
two
colours
which
had
belonged
to
the
same
regiment
the
new
york
i
think
these
were
captured
in
different
battles
and
on
the
last
that
was
taken
there
is
actually
inscribed
as
a
victory
the
word
which
was
the
engagement
in
which
the
regiment
had
lost
its
first
colour
mr
butler
king
a
member
of
congress
whose
acquaintance
i
had
made
in
the
spottswood
hotel
took
me
to
spend
the
evening
at
mrs
s
a
charming
widow
for
whom
i
had
brought
a
letter
from
her
only
son
to
general
magruder
in
texas
mrs
s
is
clever
and
agreeable
she
is
a
highly
patriotic
southerner
but
she
told
me
that
she
had
stuck
fast
to
the
union
until
proclamation
calling
out
men
to
coerce
the
south
which
converted
her
and
such
a
number
of
others
into
strong
secessionists
i
spent
a
very
pleasant
evening
with
mrs
s
who
had
been
much
in
england
and
had
made
a
large
acquaintance
there
mr
butler
king
is
a
georgian
gentleman
also
very
agreeable
and
well
informed
it
is
surprising
to
hear
the
extraordinary
equanimity
with
which
he
and
hundreds
of
talk
of
their
entire
ruin
and
the
total
destruction
of
their
property
i
know
many
persons
in
england
suppose
that
great
britain
has
now
made
enemies
both
of
the
north
and
south
but
i
do
not
believe
this
is
the
case
with
respect
to
the
south
whatever
certain
richmond
papers
may
say
the
south
looks
to
england
for
everything
when
this
war
is
over
she
wants
our
merchants
to
buy
her
cotton
she
wants
our
ships
to
carry
it
she
is
willing
that
england
should
supply
her
with
all
the
necessaries
which
she
formerly
received
from
the
north
it
is
common
to
hear
people
declare
they
would
rather
pay
twice
the
price
for
english
goods
than
trade
any
more
with
yankeedom
friday
i
embarked
at
on
board
a
small
steamer
to
visit
drewry
bluff
on
the
james
river
the
scene
of
the
repulse
of
the
ironclads
monitor
and
galena
the
stream
exactly
opposite
richmond
is
very
shallow
and
rocky
but
it
becomes
navigable
about
a
mile
below
the
city
drewry
bluff
is
about
eight
miles
distant
and
before
reaching
it
we
had
to
pass
through
two
bridges
one
of
boats
and
the
other
a
wooden
bridge
i
was
shown
over
the
fortifications
by
captain
chatard
confederate
states
navy
who
was
in
command
during
the
absence
of
captain
lee
a
flotilla
of
confederate
gunboats
was
lying
just
above
the
obstructions
and
nearly
opposite
to
the
bluff
amongst
them
was
the
yorktown
patrick
henry
which
under
the
command
of
my
friend
captain
tucker
figured
in
the
memorable
merrimac
attack
there
was
also
an
ironclad
called
the
richmond
and
two
or
three
smaller
craft
beyond
drewry
bluff
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
is
chaffin
bluff
which
mounts
heavy
guns
and
forms
the
extreme
right
of
the
richmond
defences
on
that
side
of
the
river
at
the
time
of
the
attack
by
the
two
federal
ironclads
assisted
by
several
wooden
gunboats
there
were
only
three
guns
mounted
on
bluff
which
is
from
to
feet
high
these
had
been
hastily
removed
from
the
yorktown
and
dragged
up
there
by
captain
tucker
on
the
previous
day
they
were
either
or
guns
i
forget
which
during
the
contest
the
monitor
notwithstanding
her
recent
exploits
with
the
merrimac
kept
herself
out
of
much
danger
partly
concealed
behind
the
bend
of
the
river
but
her
consort
the
ironclad
galena
approached
boldly
to
within
yards
of
the
bluff
the
wooden
gunboats
remained
a
considerable
distance
down
the
river
after
the
fight
had
lasted
about
four
hours
the
galena
withdrew
much
crippled
and
has
never
i
believe
been
known
to
fame
since
the
result
of
the
contest
goes
to
confirm
the
opinion
expressed
to
me
by
general
beauregard
that
ironclads
can
not
resist
the
plunging
fire
of
forts
even
though
that
latter
can
only
boast
of
the
old
guns
a
captain
maury
took
me
on
board
the
richmond
ironclad
in
which
vessel
i
saw
a
brook
gun
weighing
they
told
me
and
capable
of
standing
a
charge
of
lb
of
powder
amongst
my
from
richmond
i
had
observed
a
very
prisoner
in
charge
of
one
soldier
captain
maury
informed
me
that
this
individual
was
being
taken
to
chaffin
bluff
where
he
is
to
be
shot
at
noon
for
desertion
major
norris
and
i
bathed
in
james
river
at
from
a
rocky
and
very
pretty
island
in
the
centre
of
the
stream
i
spent
another
very
agreeable
evening
at
mrs
s
and
met
general
randolph
mr
butler
king
and
mr
conrad
there
also
colonel
johnston
to
the
president
who
told
me
that
they
had
been
forced
in
order
to
stop
burnside
executions
in
kentucky
to
select
two
federal
captains
and
put
them
under
orders
for
death
general
randolph
looks
in
weak
health
he
had
for
some
time
filled
the
post
of
secretary
of
war
but
it
is
supposed
that
he
and
the
president
did
not
quite
hit
it
off
together
mr
conrad
as
well
as
mr
king
is
a
member
of
congress
and
he
explained
to
me
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
each
state
was
most
desirous
of
being
put
without
the
slightest
necessity
under
military
law
which
they
thought
was
quite
the
correct
remedy
for
all
evil
but
so
sick
did
they
soon
become
of
this
that
at
the
last
session
congress
had
refused
the
president
the
power
of
putting
any
place
under
military
law
which
is
just
as
absurd
in
the
other
direction
i
hear
every
one
complaining
dreadfully
of
general
johnston
inactivity
in
mississippi
and
all
now
despair
of
saving
vicksburg
they
deplore
its
loss
more
on
account
of
the
effect
its
conquest
may
have
in
prolonging
the
war
than
for
any
other
reason
no
one
seems
to
fear
that
its
possession
together
with
port
hudson
will
really
enable
the
yankees
to
navigate
the
mississippi
nor
do
they
fear
that
the
latter
will
be
able
to
prevent
communication
with
the
country
many
of
the
richmond
papers
seem
to
me
scarcely
more
respectable
than
the
new
york
ones
party
spirit
runs
high
liberty
of
the
press
is
carried
to
its
fullest
extent
saturday
armed
with
letters
of
introduction
from
the
for
generals
lee
and
longstreet
i
left
richmond
at
to
join
the
virginian
army
i
was
accompanied
by
a
sergeant
of
the
signal
corps
sent
by
my
kind
friend
major
norris
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
me
in
getting
on
we
took
the
train
as
far
as
culpepper
and
arrived
there
at
after
having
changed
cars
at
gordonsville
near
which
place
i
observed
an
enormous
pile
of
excellent
rifles
rotting
in
the
open
air
these
had
been
captured
at
chancellorsville
but
the
confederates
have
already
such
a
superabundant
stock
of
rifles
that
apparently
they
can
afford
to
let
them
spoil
the
weather
was
quite
cool
after
the
rain
of
last
night
the
country
through
which
we
passed
had
been
in
the
enemy
hands
last
year
and
was
evacuated
by
them
after
the
battles
before
richmond
but
at
that
time
it
was
not
their
custom
to
burn
destroy
and
devastate
everything
looked
green
and
beautiful
and
did
not
in
the
least
give
one
the
idea
of
a
hot
country
in
his
late
daring
raid
the
federal
general
stoneman
crossed
this
railroad
and
destroyed
a
small
portion
of
it
burned
a
few
buildings
and
penetrated
to
within
three
miles
of
richmond
but
he
and
his
men
were
in
such
a
hurry
that
they
had
not
time
to
do
much
serious
harm
culpepper
was
until
five
days
ago
the
headquarters
of
generals
lee
and
longstreet
but
since
ewell
recapture
of
winchester
the
whole
army
had
advanced
with
rapidity
and
it
was
my
object
to
catch
it
up
as
quickly
as
possible
on
arriving
at
culpepper
my
sergeant
handed
me
over
to
another
myrmidon
of
major
norris
with
orders
from
that
officer
to
supply
me
with
a
horse
and
take
me
himself
to
join
mr
lawley
who
had
passed
through
for
the
same
purpose
as
myself
three
days
before
sergeant
norris
my
new
chaperon
is
cousin
to
major
norris
and
is
a
capital
fellow
before
the
war
he
was
a
gentleman
of
good
means
in
maryland
and
was
accustomed
to
a
life
of
luxury
he
now
lives
the
life
of
a
private
soldier
with
perfect
contentment
and
is
utterly
indifferent
to
civilisation
and
comfort
although
he
was
unwell
when
i
arrived
and
it
was
pouring
with
rain
he
proposed
that
we
should
start
at
once
i
agreed
and
we
did
so
our
horses
had
both
sore
backs
were
both
unfed
except
on
grass
and
mine
was
deficient
of
a
shoe
they
nevertheless
travelled
well
and
we
reached
a
hamlet
called
woodville
fifteen
miles
distant
at
we
had
great
difficulty
in
procuring
shelter
but
at
length
we
overcame
the
inhospitality
of
a
native
who
gave
us
a
feed
of
corn
for
our
horses
and
a
blanket
on
the
floor
for
ourselves
sunday
we
got
the
horse
shod
with
some
delay
and
after
refreshing
the
animals
with
corn
and
ourselves
with
bacon
we
effected
a
start
at
we
experienced
considerable
difficulty
in
carrying
my
small
saddlebags
and
knapsack
on
account
of
the
state
of
our
backs
mine
was
not
very
bad
but
that
of
norris
was
in
a
horrid
state
we
had
not
travelled
more
than
a
few
miles
when
the
latter
animal
cast
a
shoe
which
took
us
an
hour
to
replace
at
a
village
called
sperryville
the
country
is
really
magnificent
but
as
it
has
supported
two
large
armies
for
two
years
it
is
now
completely
cleaned
out
it
is
almost
uncultivated
and
no
animals
are
grazing
where
there
used
to
be
hundreds
all
fences
have
been
destroyed
and
numberless
farms
burnt
the
chimneys
alone
left
standing
it
is
difficult
to
depict
and
impossible
to
exaggerate
the
sufferings
which
this
part
of
virginia
has
undergone
but
the
ravages
of
war
have
not
been
able
to
destroy
the
beauties
of
nature
the
verdure
is
charming
the
trees
magnificent
the
country
undulating
and
the
blue
ridge
mountains
form
the
background
being
sunday
we
met
about
thirty
negroes
going
to
church
wonderfully
smartly
dressed
some
both
male
and
female
riding
on
horseback
and
others
in
waggons
but
mr
norris
informs
me
that
two
years
ago
we
should
have
numbered
them
by
hundreds
we
soon
began
to
catch
up
the
sick
and
men
of
the
army
but
not
in
great
numbers
most
of
them
were
well
shod
though
i
saw
two
without
shoes
after
crossing
a
gap
in
the
blue
ridge
range
we
reached
front
royal
at
and
we
were
now
in
the
shenandoah
valley
the
scene
of
jackson
celebrated
campaigns
front
royal
is
a
pretty
little
place
and
was
the
theatre
of
one
of
the
earliest
fights
in
the
war
which
was
commenced
by
a
maryland
regiment
of
confederates
who
as
mr
norris
observed
jumped
on
to
a
federal
regiment
from
the
same
state
and
whipped
it
badly
since
that
time
the
village
has
changed
hands
continually
and
was
visited
by
the
federals
only
a
few
days
previous
to
ewell
rapid
advance
ten
days
ago
after
immense
trouble
we
procured
a
feed
of
corn
for
the
horses
and
to
mr
norris
astonishment
i
was
impudent
enough
to
get
food
for
ourselves
by
appealing
to
the
kind
feelings
of
two
female
citizens
of
front
royal
who
during
our
supper
entertained
us
by
stories
of
the
manner
they
annoyed
the
northern
soldiers
by
disagreeable
allusions
to
stonewall
jackson
we
started
again
at
and
crossed
two
branches
of
the
shenandoah
river
a
broad
and
rapid
stream
both
the
railway
and
carriage
bridges
having
been
destroyed
we
had
to
ford
it
and
as
the
water
was
deep
we
were
only
just
able
to
accomplish
the
passage
the
soldiers
of
whom
there
were
a
number
with
us
took
off
their
trousers
and
held
their
rifles
and
ammunition
above
their
heads
soon
afterwards
our
horses
became
very
for
although
the
weather
had
been
cool
the
roads
were
muddy
and
hard
upon
them
at
we
came
up
with
pender
division
encamped
on
the
sides
of
hills
illuminated
with
innumerable
which
looked
very
picturesque
after
passing
through
about
two
miles
of
bivouacs
we
begged
for
shelter
in
the
hayloft
of
a
mr
mason
we
turned
our
horses
into
a
field
and
found
our
hayloft
most
luxurious
after
miles
ride
at
a
foot
pace
stonewall
jackson
is
considered
a
regular
demigod
in
this
country
monday
we
started
without
food
or
corn
at
and
soon
became
entangled
with
pender
division
on
its
line
of
march
which
delayed
us
a
good
deal
my
poor
brute
of
a
horse
also
took
this
opportunity
of
throwing
two
more
shoes
which
we
found
it
impossible
to
replace
all
the
blacksmiths
shops
having
been
pressed
by
the
troops
the
soldiers
of
this
division
are
a
remarkably
fine
body
of
men
and
look
quite
seasoned
and
ready
for
any
work
their
clothing
is
serviceable
so
also
are
their
boots
but
there
is
the
usual
utter
absence
of
uniformity
as
to
colour
and
shape
of
their
garments
and
hats
grey
of
all
shades
and
brown
clothing
with
felt
hats
predominate
the
confederate
troops
are
now
entirely
armed
with
excellent
rifles
mostly
enfields
when
they
first
turned
out
they
were
in
the
habit
of
wearing
numerous
revolvers
and
general
lee
is
said
to
have
mildly
remarked
gentlemen
i
think
you
will
find
an
enfield
rifle
a
bayonet
and
sixty
rounds
of
ammunition
as
much
as
you
can
conveniently
carry
in
the
way
of
arms
they
laughed
and
thought
they
knew
better
but
the
and
gradually
disappeared
and
now
none
are
to
be
seen
among
the
infantry
the
artillery
horses
are
in
poor
condition
and
only
get
lb
of
corn
the
artillery
is
of
all
kinds
parrots
napoleons
rifled
and
smooth
bores
all
shapes
and
sizes
most
of
them
bear
the
letters
showing
that
they
have
changed
masters
the
colours
of
the
regiments
differ
from
the
blue
i
saw
with
bragg
army
they
are
generally
red
with
a
blue
st
andrew
cross
showing
the
stars
this
pattern
is
said
to
have
been
invented
by
general
joseph
johnston
as
not
so
liable
to
be
mistaken
for
the
yankee
flag
the
new
confederate
flag
has
evidently
been
adopted
from
this
as
it
is
called
most
of
the
colours
in
this
division
bear
the
names
manassas
fredericksburg
seven
pines
harper
ferry
chancellorsville
i
saw
no
stragglers
during
the
time
i
was
with
pender
division
but
although
the
virginian
army
certainly
does
get
over
a
deal
of
ground
yet
they
move
at
a
slow
dragging
pace
and
are
evidently
not
good
marchers
naturally
as
mr
norris
observed
to
me
before
this
war
we
were
a
lazy
set
of
devils
our
niggers
worked
for
us
and
none
of
us
ever
dreamt
of
walking
though
we
all
rode
a
great
deal
we
reached
berryville
eleven
miles
at
the
headquarters
of
general
lee
were
a
few
hundred
yards
beyond
this
place
just
before
getting
there
i
saw
a
general
officer
of
handsome
appearance
who
must
i
knew
from
description
be
the
but
as
he
was
evidently
engaged
i
did
not
join
him
although
i
gave
my
letter
of
introduction
to
one
of
his
staff
shortly
afterwards
i
presented
myself
to
mr
lawley
with
whom
i
became
immediately
great
friends
he
introduced
me
to
general
chilton
the
of
the
army
to
colonel
cole
the
to
major
taylor
captain
venables
and
other
officers
of
general
lee
staff
and
he
suggested
as
the
headquarters
were
so
busy
and
crowded
that
he
and
i
should
ride
to
winchester
at
once
and
afterwards
ask
for
hospitality
from
the
less
busy
staff
of
general
longstreet
i
was
also
introduced
to
captain
schreibert
of
the
prussian
army
who
is
a
guest
sometimes
of
general
lee
and
sometimes
of
general
stuart
of
the
cavalry
he
had
been
present
at
one
of
the
late
severe
cavalry
skirmishes
which
have
been
of
constant
occurrence
since
the
sudden
advance
of
this
army
this
advance
has
been
so
admirably
timed
as
to
allow
of
the
capture
of
winchester
with
its
yankee
garrison
and
stores
and
at
the
same
time
of
the
seizure
of
the
gaps
of
the
blue
ridge
range
all
the
officers
were
speaking
with
regret
of
the
severe
wound
received
in
this
skirmish
by
major
von
borke
another
prussian
but
now
in
the
confederate
states
service
and
to
jeb
stuart
after
eating
some
breakfast
lawley
and
i
rode
ten
miles
into
winchester
my
horse
minus
his
foreshoes
showed
signs
of
great
fatigue
but
we
struggled
into
winchester
at
where
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
procure
shoes
for
the
horse
and
by
introduction
admirable
quarters
for
both
of
us
at
the
house
of
the
hospitable
mrs
with
whom
he
had
lodged
seven
months
before
and
who
was
charmed
to
see
him
her
two
nieces
who
are
as
agreeable
as
they
are
gave
us
a
miserable
picture
of
the
three
captivities
they
have
experienced
under
the
federal
commanders
banks
shields
and
milroy
the
unfortunate
town
of
winchester
seems
to
have
been
made
a
regular
shuttlecock
of
by
the
contending
armies
stonewall
jackson
rescued
it
once
and
last
sunday
week
his
successor
general
ewell
drove
out
milroy
the
name
of
milroy
is
always
associated
with
that
of
butler
and
his
rule
in
winchester
seems
to
have
been
somewhat
similar
to
that
of
his
illustrious
rival
in
new
orleans
should
either
of
these
two
individuals
fall
alive
into
the
hands
of
the
confederates
i
imagine
that
jeff
davis
himself
would
be
unable
to
save
their
lives
even
if
he
were
disposed
to
do
so
before
leaving
richmond
i
heard
every
one
expressing
regret
that
milroy
should
have
escaped
as
the
recapture
of
winchester
seemed
to
be
incomplete
without
him
more
than
of
his
men
were
taken
in
the
two
forts
which
overlook
the
town
and
which
were
carried
by
assault
by
a
louisianian
brigade
with
trifling
loss
the
joy
of
the
unfortunate
inhabitants
may
easily
be
conceived
at
this
sudden
and
unexpected
relief
from
their
last
captivity
which
had
lasted
six
months
during
the
whole
of
this
time
they
could
not
legally
buy
an
article
of
provisions
without
taking
the
oath
of
allegiance
which
they
magnanimously
refused
to
do
they
were
unable
to
hear
a
word
of
their
male
relations
or
friends
who
were
all
in
the
southern
army
they
were
shut
up
in
their
houses
after
and
sometimes
deprived
of
light
part
of
our
kind
house
was
forcibly
occupied
by
a
vulgar
ignorant
and
federal
officer
driver
of
a
street
car
and
they
were
constantly
subjected
to
the
most
humiliating
insults
on
pretence
of
searching
the
house
for
arms
documents
to
my
surprise
however
these
ladies
spoke
of
the
enemy
with
less
violence
and
rancour
than
almost
any
other
ladies
i
had
met
with
during
my
travels
through
the
whole
southern
confederacy
when
i
told
them
so
they
replied
that
they
who
had
seen
many
men
shot
down
in
the
streets
before
their
own
eyes
knew
what
they
were
talking
about
which
other
and
more
excited
southern
women
did
not
ewell
division
is
in
front
and
across
the
potomac
and
before
i
left
headquarters
this
morning
i
saw
longstreet
corps
beginning
to
follow
in
the
same
direction
indian
corn
the
honourable
lawley
author
of
the
admirable
letters
from
the
southern
states
which
appear
in
the
newspaper
tuesday
lawley
and
i
went
to
inspect
the
site
of
mr
mason
the
southern
commissioner
in
london
once
pretty
house
a
melancholy
scene
it
had
been
charmingly
situated
near
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
by
all
accounts
must
have
been
a
delightful
little
place
when
lawley
saw
it
seven
months
ago
it
was
then
only
a
ruin
but
since
that
time
northern
vengeance
as
directed
by
general
milroy
has
satiated
itself
by
destroying
almost
the
very
foundations
of
the
house
of
this
as
they
call
him
literally
not
one
stone
remains
standing
upon
another
and
the
seems
to
have
been
carted
away
for
there
is
now
a
big
hole
where
the
principal
part
of
the
house
stood
troops
have
evidently
been
encamped
upon
the
ground
which
was
strewed
with
fragments
of
yankee
clothing
accoutrements
i
understand
that
winchester
used
to
be
a
most
agreeable
little
town
and
its
society
extremely
pleasant
many
of
its
houses
are
now
destroyed
or
converted
into
hospitals
the
rest
look
miserable
and
dilapidated
its
female
inhabitants
for
the
males
are
all
absent
in
the
army
are
familiar
with
the
bloody
realities
of
war
as
many
as
wounded
have
been
accommodated
here
at
one
time
all
the
ladies
are
accustomed
to
the
bursting
of
shells
and
the
sight
of
fighting
and
all
are
turned
into
hospital
nurses
or
cooks
from
the
utter
impossibility
of
procuring
corn
i
was
forced
to
take
the
horses
out
grazing
a
mile
beyond
the
town
for
four
hours
in
the
morning
and
two
in
the
afternoon
as
one
must
lose
sight
of
them
for
a
moment
this
occupied
me
all
day
while
lawley
wrote
in
the
house
in
the
evening
we
went
to
visit
two
wounded
officers
in
mrs
house
a
major
and
a
captain
in
the
louisianian
brigade
which
stormed
the
forts
last
sunday
week
i
am
afraid
the
captain
will
die
both
are
shot
through
the
body
but
are
cheery
they
served
under
stonewall
jackson
until
his
death
and
they
venerate
his
name
though
they
both
agree
that
he
has
got
an
efficient
successor
in
ewell
his
former
companion
in
arms
and
they
confirmed
a
great
deal
of
what
general
johnston
had
told
me
as
to
jackson
having
been
so
much
indebted
to
ewell
for
several
of
his
victories
they
gave
us
an
animated
account
of
the
spirits
and
feeling
of
the
army
at
no
period
of
the
war
they
say
have
the
men
been
so
well
equipped
so
well
clothed
so
eager
for
a
fight
or
so
confident
of
success
a
very
different
state
of
affairs
from
that
which
characterised
the
maryland
invasion
of
last
year
when
half
of
the
army
were
barefooted
stragglers
and
many
of
the
remainder
unwilling
and
reluctant
to
cross
the
potomac
miss
told
me
that
dancing
and
are
forbidden
by
the
episcopal
church
in
this
part
of
virginia
wednesday
lawley
being
in
weak
health
we
determined
to
spend
another
day
with
our
kind
friends
in
winchester
i
took
the
horses
out
again
for
six
hours
to
graze
and
made
acquaintance
with
two
irishmen
who
gave
me
some
cut
grass
and
salt
for
the
horses
one
of
these
men
had
served
and
had
been
wounded
in
the
southern
army
i
remarked
to
him
that
he
must
have
killed
lots
of
his
own
countrymen
to
which
he
replied
oh
yes
but
faix
they
must
all
take
it
as
it
comes
i
have
always
observed
that
southern
irishmen
make
excellent
rebs
and
have
no
sort
of
scruple
in
killing
as
many
of
their
northern
brethren
as
they
possibly
can
i
saw
many
new
yankee
graves
which
the
deaths
among
the
captives
are
constantly
increasing
wooden
are
put
at
each
grave
on
which
is
written
an
unknown
soldier
died
of
wounds
received
upon
the
field
of
battle
june
or
a
sentry
stopped
me
as
i
was
going
out
of
town
and
when
i
showed
him
my
pass
from
general
chilton
he
replied
with
great
firmness
but
with
perfect
courtesy
i
extremely
sorry
sir
but
if
you
were
the
secretary
of
war
or
jeff
davis
himself
you
could
pass
without
a
passport
from
the
thursday
we
took
leave
of
mrs
and
her
hospitable
family
and
started
at
to
overtake
generals
lee
and
longstreet
who
were
supposed
to
be
crossing
the
potomac
at
williamsport
before
we
had
got
more
than
a
few
miles
on
our
way
we
began
to
meet
horses
and
oxen
the
first
fruits
of
ewell
advance
into
pennsylvania
the
weather
was
cool
and
showery
and
all
went
swimmingly
for
the
first
fourteen
miles
when
we
caught
up
division
which
belongs
to
longstreet
corps
as
my
horse
about
this
time
began
to
show
signs
of
fatigue
and
as
lawley
pickaxed
most
alarmingly
we
turned
them
into
some
clover
to
graze
whilst
we
watched
two
brigades
pass
along
the
road
they
were
commanded
i
think
by
semmes
and
barksdale
and
were
composed
of
georgians
mississippians
and
south
carolinians
they
marched
very
well
and
there
was
no
attempt
at
straggling
quite
a
different
state
of
things
from
johnston
men
in
mississippi
all
were
well
shod
and
efficiently
clothed
in
rear
of
each
regiment
were
from
twenty
to
thirty
negro
slaves
and
a
certain
number
of
unarmed
men
carrying
stretchers
and
wearing
in
their
hats
the
red
badges
of
the
ambulance
corps
this
is
an
excellent
institution
for
it
prevents
unwounded
men
falling
out
on
pretence
of
taking
wounded
to
the
rear
the
knapsacks
of
the
men
still
bear
the
names
of
the
massachusetts
vermont
new
jersey
or
other
regiments
to
which
they
originally
belonged
there
were
about
twenty
waggons
to
each
brigade
most
of
which
were
marked
and
each
of
these
brigades
was
about
strong
there
are
four
brigades
in
division
all
the
men
seemed
in
the
highest
spirits
and
were
cheering
and
yelling
most
vociferously
we
reached
martinsburg
miles
at
by
which
time
my
horse
nearly
broke
down
and
i
was
forced
to
get
off
and
walk
martinsburg
and
this
part
of
virginia
are
supposed
to
be
more
unionist
than
southern
however
many
of
the
women
went
through
the
form
of
cheering
division
as
it
passed
i
daresay
they
would
perform
the
same
ceremony
in
honour
of
the
yankees
three
miles
beyond
martinsburg
we
were
forced
by
the
state
of
our
horses
to
insist
upon
receiving
the
unwilling
hospitality
of
a
very
surly
native
who
was
evidently
unionist
in
his
proclivities
we
were
obliged
to
turn
our
horses
into
a
field
to
graze
during
the
night
this
was
most
dangerous
for
the
confederate
soldier
in
spite
of
his
many
virtues
is
as
a
rule
the
most
incorrigible
in
the
world
barksdale
was
killed
and
semmes
mortally
wounded
at
the
battle
of
gettysburg
friday
i
got
up
a
little
before
daylight
and
notwithstanding
the
drenching
rain
i
secured
our
horses
which
to
my
intense
relief
were
present
but
my
horse
showed
a
back
rapidly
getting
worse
and
both
looked
mean
to
a
degree
lawley
being
ill
he
declined
starting
in
the
rain
and
our
host
became
more
and
more
surly
when
we
stated
our
intention
of
remaining
with
him
however
the
sight
of
instead
of
confederate
paper
or
even
greenbacks
soothed
him
wonderfully
and
he
furnished
us
with
some
breakfast
all
this
time
division
was
passing
the
door
but
so
strict
was
the
discipline
that
the
only
man
who
loafed
in
was
immediately
pounced
upon
and
carried
away
captive
at
the
weather
having
become
a
little
clearer
we
made
a
start
but
under
very
unpromising
circumstances
lawley
was
so
ill
that
he
could
hardly
ride
his
horse
was
most
unsafe
and
had
cast
a
shoe
my
animal
was
in
such
a
miserable
state
that
i
had
not
the
inhumanity
to
ride
him
but
by
the
assistance
of
his
tail
i
managed
to
struggle
through
the
deep
mud
and
wet
we
soon
became
entangled
with
division
and
reached
the
potomac
a
distance
of
nine
miles
and
a
half
at
the
river
is
both
wide
and
deep
and
in
fording
it
for
which
purpose
i
was
obliged
to
mount
we
keep
our
legs
out
of
the
water
the
little
town
of
williamsport
is
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
and
we
were
now
in
maryland
we
had
the
mortification
to
learn
that
generals
lee
and
longstreet
had
quitted
williamsport
this
morning
at
and
were
therefore
obliged
to
toil
on
to
hagerstown
six
miles
farther
this
latter
place
is
evidently
by
no
means
rebel
in
its
sentiments
for
all
the
houses
were
shut
up
and
many
apparently
abandoned
the
few
natives
that
were
about
stared
at
the
troops
with
sulky
indifference
after
passing
through
hagerstown
we
could
obtain
no
certain
information
of
the
whereabouts
of
the
two
generals
nor
could
we
get
any
willing
hospitality
from
any
one
but
at
our
horses
being
quite
exhausted
we
forced
ourselves
into
the
house
of
a
dutchman
who
became
a
little
more
civil
at
the
sight
of
gold
although
the
assurance
that
we
were
english
travellers
and
not
rebels
had
produced
no
effect
i
had
walked
in
mud
and
rain
seventeen
miles
and
i
dared
not
take
off
my
solitary
pair
of
boots
because
i
knew
i
should
never
get
them
on
again
saturday
lawley
was
so
ill
this
morning
that
he
could
possibly
ride
i
therefore
mounted
his
horse
a
little
before
daybreak
and
started
in
search
of
the
generals
after
riding
eight
miles
i
came
up
with
general
longstreet
at
and
was
only
just
in
time
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
moving
both
he
and
his
staff
were
most
kind
when
i
introduced
myself
and
stated
my
difficulties
he
arranged
that
an
ambulance
should
fetch
lawley
and
he
immediately
invited
me
to
join
his
mess
during
the
campaign
he
told
me
which
i
did
not
know
that
we
were
now
in
pennsylvania
the
country
maryland
being
only
ten
miles
broad
at
this
point
he
declared
that
bushwhackers
exist
in
the
woods
who
shoot
unsuspecting
stragglers
and
it
would
therefore
be
unsafe
that
lawley
and
i
should
travel
alone
general
longstreet
is
an
alabamian
a
thickset
man
years
of
age
he
was
an
infantry
major
in
the
old
army
and
now
commands
the
he
is
never
far
from
general
lee
who
relies
very
much
upon
his
judgment
by
the
soldiers
he
is
invariably
spoken
of
as
the
best
fighter
in
the
whole
army
whilst
speaking
of
entering
upon
the
enemy
soil
he
said
to
me
that
although
it
might
be
fair
in
just
retaliation
apply
the
yet
that
doing
so
would
demoralise
the
army
and
ruin
its
now
excellent
discipline
private
property
is
therefore
to
be
rigidly
protected
illustration
james
longstreet
at
i
returned
with
an
orderly
or
courier
as
they
are
called
to
the
farmhouse
in
which
i
had
left
lawley
and
after
seeing
all
arranged
satisfactorily
about
the
ambulance
i
rode
slowly
on
to
rejoin
general
longstreet
near
chambersburg
which
is
a
pennsylvanian
town
distant
miles
from
hagerstown
i
was
with
division
and
observed
that
the
moment
they
entered
pennsylvania
the
troops
opened
the
fences
and
enlarged
the
road
about
twenty
yards
on
each
side
which
enabled
the
waggons
and
themselves
to
proceed
together
this
is
the
only
damage
i
saw
done
by
the
confederates
this
part
of
pennsylvania
is
very
flourishing
highly
cultivated
and
in
comparison
with
the
southern
states
thickly
peopled
but
all
the
cattle
and
horses
having
been
seized
by
ewell
had
now
come
to
a
complete
in
passing
through
greencastle
we
found
all
the
houses
and
windows
shut
up
the
natives
in
their
sunday
clothes
standing
at
their
doors
regarding
the
troops
in
a
very
unfriendly
manner
i
saw
no
straggling
into
the
houses
nor
were
any
of
the
inhabitants
disturbed
or
annoyed
by
the
soldiers
sentries
were
placed
at
the
doors
of
many
of
the
best
houses
to
prevent
any
officer
or
soldier
from
getting
in
on
any
pretence
i
entered
chambersburg
at
this
is
a
town
of
some
size
and
importance
all
its
houses
were
shut
up
but
the
natives
were
in
the
streets
or
at
the
upper
windows
looking
in
a
scowling
and
bewildered
manner
at
the
confederate
troops
who
were
marching
gaily
past
to
the
tune
of
dixie
land
the
women
many
of
whom
were
pretty
and
well
dressed
were
particularly
sour
and
disagreeable
in
their
remarks
i
heard
one
of
them
say
look
at
pharaoh
army
going
to
the
red
sea
others
were
pointing
and
laughing
at
hood
ragged
jacks
who
were
passing
at
the
time
this
division
well
known
for
its
fighting
qualities
is
composed
of
texans
alabamians
and
arkansians
and
they
certainly
are
a
queer
lot
to
look
at
they
carry
less
than
any
other
troops
many
of
them
have
only
got
an
old
piece
of
carpet
or
rug
as
baggage
many
have
discarded
their
shoes
in
the
mud
all
are
ragged
and
dirty
but
full
of
and
confidence
in
themselves
and
in
their
general
hood
they
answered
the
numerous
taunts
of
the
chambersburg
ladies
with
cheers
and
laughter
one
female
had
seen
fit
to
adorn
her
ample
bosom
with
a
huge
yankee
flag
and
she
stood
at
the
door
of
her
house
her
countenance
expressing
the
greatest
contempt
for
the
barefooted
rebs
several
companies
passed
her
without
taking
any
notice
but
at
length
a
texan
gravely
remarked
take
care
madam
for
boys
are
great
at
storming
breastworks
when
the
yankee
colours
is
on
them
after
this
speech
the
patriotic
lady
beat
a
precipitate
retreat
sentries
were
placed
at
the
doors
of
all
the
principal
houses
and
the
town
was
cleared
of
all
but
the
military
passing
through
or
on
duty
some
of
the
troops
marched
straight
through
the
town
and
bivouacked
on
the
carlisle
road
others
turned
off
to
the
right
and
occupied
the
gettysburg
turnpike
i
found
generals
lee
and
longstreet
encamped
on
the
latter
road
of
a
mile
from
the
town
general
longstreet
and
his
staff
at
once
received
me
into
their
mess
and
i
was
introduced
to
major
fairfax
major
latrobe
and
captain
rogers
of
his
personal
staff
also
to
major
moses
the
chief
commissary
whose
tent
i
am
to
share
he
is
the
most
jovial
amusing
and
clever
son
of
israel
i
ever
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
the
other
officers
on
longstreet
headquarter
staff
are
colonel
sorrell
manning
ordnance
officer
major
walton
captain
goree
and
major
clark
all
excellent
good
fellows
and
most
hospitable
lawley
is
to
live
with
three
doctors
on
the
headquarter
staff
their
names
are
cullen
barksdale
and
maury
they
form
a
jolly
trio
and
live
much
more
luxuriously
than
their
generals
major
moses
tells
me
that
his
orders
are
to
open
the
stores
in
chambersburg
by
force
and
seize
all
that
is
wanted
for
the
army
in
a
regular
and
official
manner
giving
in
return
its
value
in
confederate
money
on
a
receipt
the
storekeepers
have
doubtless
sent
away
their
most
valuable
goods
on
the
approach
of
the
confederate
army
much
also
has
been
already
seized
by
ewell
who
passed
through
nearly
a
week
ago
but
moses
was
much
elated
at
having
already
discovered
a
large
supply
of
excellent
felt
hats
hidden
away
in
a
cellar
which
he
annexed
at
once
i
was
told
this
evening
the
numbers
which
have
crossed
the
potomac
and
also
the
number
of
pieces
of
artillery
there
is
a
large
train
of
ammunition
for
if
the
army
advances
any
deeper
into
the
country
general
lee
can
not
expect
to
keep
his
communications
open
to
the
rear
and
as
the
staff
officers
say
in
every
battle
we
fight
we
must
capture
as
much
ammunition
as
we
use
this
necessity
however
does
not
seem
to
disturb
them
as
it
has
hitherto
been
their
regular
style
of
doing
business
ewell
after
the
capture
of
winchester
had
advanced
rapidly
into
pennsylvania
and
has
already
sent
back
great
quantities
of
horses
mules
waggons
beeves
and
other
necessaries
he
is
now
at
or
beyond
carlisle
laying
the
country
under
contribution
and
making
pennsylvania
support
the
war
instead
of
poor
and
virginia
the
corps
of
generals
hill
and
longstreet
are
now
near
this
place
all
full
of
confidence
and
in
high
spirits
having
lived
at
the
headquarters
of
all
the
principal
confederate
generals
i
am
able
to
affirm
that
the
relation
between
their
staffs
and
themselves
and
the
way
the
duty
is
carried
on
is
very
similar
to
what
it
is
in
the
british
army
all
the
generals
johnston
bragg
polk
hardee
longstreet
and
lee
are
thorough
soldiers
and
their
staffs
are
composed
of
gentlemen
of
position
and
education
who
have
now
been
trained
into
excellent
and
zealous
staff
officers
sunday
no
officer
or
soldier
under
the
rank
of
a
general
is
allowed
into
chambersburg
without
a
special
order
from
general
lee
which
he
is
very
chary
of
giving
and
i
hear
of
officers
of
rank
being
refused
this
pass
moses
proceeded
into
town
at
with
an
official
requisition
for
three
days
rations
for
the
whole
army
in
this
neighbourhood
these
rations
he
is
to
seize
by
force
if
not
voluntarily
supplied
i
was
introduced
to
general
hood
this
morning
he
is
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
grave
face
and
a
beard
years
old
and
is
accounted
one
of
the
best
and
most
promising
officers
in
the
army
by
his
texan
and
alabamian
troops
he
is
adored
he
formerly
commanded
the
texan
brigade
but
has
now
been
promoted
to
the
command
of
a
division
his
troops
are
accused
of
being
a
wild
set
and
difficult
to
manage
and
it
is
the
great
object
of
the
chiefs
to
check
their
innate
plundering
propensities
by
every
means
in
their
power
i
went
into
chambersburg
at
noon
and
found
lawley
ensconced
in
the
franklin
hotel
both
he
and
i
had
much
difficulty
in
getting
into
that
establishment
the
doors
being
locked
and
only
opened
with
the
greatest
caution
lawley
had
had
a
most
painful
journey
in
the
ambulance
yesterday
and
was
much
exhausted
no
one
in
the
hotel
would
take
the
slightest
notice
of
him
and
all
scowled
at
me
in
a
most
disagreeable
manner
pennsylvanian
viragos
surrounded
and
assailed
me
with
their
united
tongues
to
a
deafening
degree
nor
would
they
believe
me
when
i
told
them
i
was
an
english
spectator
and
a
noncombatant
they
said
i
must
be
either
a
rebel
or
a
yankee
by
which
expression
i
learned
for
the
first
time
that
the
term
yankee
is
as
much
used
as
a
reproach
in
pennsylvania
as
in
the
south
the
sight
of
gold
which
i
exchanged
for
their
greenbacks
brought
about
a
change
and
by
degrees
they
became
quite
affable
they
seemed
very
ignorant
and
confused
texans
with
mexicans
after
leaving
lawley
pretty
comfortable
i
walked
about
the
town
and
witnessed
the
pressing
operations
of
moses
and
his
myrmidons
neither
the
mayor
nor
the
corporation
were
to
be
found
anywhere
nor
were
the
keys
of
the
principal
stores
forthcoming
until
moses
began
to
apply
the
axe
the
citizens
were
lolling
about
the
streets
in
a
listless
manner
and
showing
no
great
signs
of
discontent
they
had
left
to
their
women
the
task
of
resisting
the
commissaries
a
duty
which
they
were
fully
competent
to
perform
no
soldiers
but
those
on
duty
were
visible
in
the
streets
in
the
evening
i
called
again
to
see
lawley
and
found
in
his
room
an
austrian
officer
in
the
full
uniform
of
the
hungarian
hussars
he
had
got
a
year
leave
of
absence
and
has
just
succeeded
in
crossing
the
potomac
though
not
without
much
trouble
and
difficulty
when
he
stated
his
intention
of
wearing
his
uniform
i
explained
to
him
the
invariable
custom
of
the
confederate
soldiers
of
never
allowing
the
smallest
peculiarity
of
dress
or
appearance
to
pass
without
a
torrent
of
jokes
which
however
ended
in
becoming
rather
monotonous
i
returned
to
camp
at
major
moses
did
not
get
back
till
very
late
much
depressed
at
the
of
his
mission
he
had
searched
all
day
most
indefatigably
and
had
endured
much
contumely
from
the
union
ladies
who
called
him
a
thievish
little
rebel
scoundrel
and
other
opprobrious
epithets
but
this
did
not
annoy
him
so
much
as
the
manner
in
which
everything
he
wanted
had
been
sent
away
or
hidden
in
private
houses
which
he
was
not
allowed
by
general
lee
order
to
search
he
had
only
managed
to
secure
a
quantity
of
molasses
sugar
and
whisky
poor
moses
was
thoroughly
exhausted
but
he
endured
the
chaff
of
his
brother
officers
with
much
and
they
made
him
continually
repeat
the
different
names
he
had
been
called
he
said
that
at
first
the
women
refused
his
confederate
trash
with
great
scorn
but
they
ended
in
being
very
particular
about
the
odd
cents
monday
we
are
still
at
chambersburg
lee
has
issued
a
remarkably
good
order
on
which
is
generally
well
received
but
i
have
heard
of
complaints
from
who
want
vengeance
for
their
wrongs
and
when
one
considers
the
numbers
of
officers
and
soldiers
with
this
army
who
have
been
totally
ruined
by
the
devastations
of
northern
troops
one
can
not
be
much
surprised
at
this
feeling
i
went
into
chambersburg
again
and
witnessed
the
singularly
good
behaviour
of
the
troops
towards
the
citizens
i
heard
soldiers
saying
to
one
another
that
they
did
not
like
being
in
a
town
in
which
they
were
very
naturally
detested
to
any
one
who
has
seen
i
the
ravages
of
the
northern
troops
in
southern
towns
this
forbearance
seems
most
commendable
and
surprising
yet
these
pennsylvanian
dutch
do
seem
the
least
thankful
and
really
appear
to
be
unaware
that
their
own
troops
have
been
for
two
years
treating
southern
towns
with
ten
times
more
harshness
they
are
the
most
unpatriotic
people
i
ever
saw
and
openly
state
that
they
do
care
which
side
wins
provided
they
are
left
alone
they
abuse
lincoln
tremendously
of
course
in
such
a
large
army
as
this
there
must
be
many
instances
of
bad
characters
who
are
always
ready
to
plunder
and
pillage
whenever
they
can
do
so
without
being
caught
the
stragglers
also
who
remain
behind
when
the
army
has
left
will
doubtless
do
much
harm
it
is
impossible
to
prevent
this
but
everything
that
can
be
done
is
done
to
protect
private
property
and
and
i
can
say
from
my
own
observation
with
wonderful
success
i
hear
instances
however
in
which
soldiers
meeting
citizens
have
made
a
long
arm
and
changed
hats
much
to
the
disgust
of
the
latter
who
are
still
more
annoyed
when
an
exchange
of
boots
is
also
proposed
their
superfine
broadcloth
is
never
in
any
danger
general
longstreet
is
generally
a
particularly
taciturn
man
but
this
evening
he
and
i
had
a
long
talk
about
texas
where
he
had
been
quartered
a
long
time
he
remembered
many
people
whom
i
had
met
quite
well
and
was
much
amused
by
the
description
of
my
travels
through
that
country
i
complimented
him
upon
the
manner
in
which
the
confederate
sentries
do
their
duty
and
said
they
were
quite
as
strict
as
and
ten
times
more
polite
than
regular
soldiers
he
replied
laughing
that
a
sentry
after
refusing
you
leave
to
enter
a
camp
might
very
likely
if
properly
asked
show
you
another
way
in
by
which
you
might
avoid
meeting
a
sentry
at
all
i
saw
general
pendleton
and
general
pickett
pendleton
is
chief
of
artillery
to
the
army
and
was
a
west
pointer
but
in
more
peaceable
times
he
fills
the
post
of
episcopal
clergyman
in
lexington
virginia
unlike
general
polk
he
unites
the
military
and
clerical
professions
together
and
continues
to
preach
whenever
he
gets
a
chance
on
these
occasions
he
wears
a
surplice
over
his
uniform
general
pickett
commands
one
of
the
divisions
in
corps
he
wears
his
hair
in
long
ringlets
and
is
altogether
rather
a
character
he
is
the
officer
who
as
captain
pickett
of
the
army
figured
in
the
difficulty
between
the
british
and
united
states
in
the
san
juan
island
affair
under
general
harney
four
or
five
years
ago
this
part
of
pennsylvania
is
much
peopled
with
the
descendants
of
germans
who
speak
an
unintelligible
language
hood
and
pickett
are
the
three
divisional
commanders
or
in
longstreet
illustration
general
robert
e
lee
tuesday
this
morning
before
marching
from
chambersburg
general
longstreet
introduced
me
to
the
general
lee
is
almost
without
exception
the
handsomest
man
of
his
age
i
ever
saw
he
is
years
old
tall
very
well
made
well
set
up
a
thorough
soldier
in
appearance
and
his
manners
are
most
courteous
and
full
of
dignity
he
is
a
perfect
gentleman
in
every
respect
i
imagine
no
man
has
so
few
enemies
or
is
so
universally
esteemed
throughout
the
south
all
agree
in
pronouncing
him
to
be
as
near
perfection
as
a
man
can
be
he
has
none
of
the
small
vices
such
as
smoking
drinking
chewing
or
swearing
and
his
bitterest
enemy
never
accused
him
of
any
of
the
greater
ones
he
generally
wears
a
long
grey
jacket
a
high
black
felt
hat
and
blue
trousers
tucked
into
his
wellington
boots
i
never
saw
him
carry
arms
and
the
only
mark
of
his
military
rank
are
the
three
stars
on
his
collar
he
rides
a
handsome
horse
which
is
extremely
well
groomed
he
himself
is
very
neat
in
his
dress
and
person
and
in
the
most
arduous
marches
he
always
looks
smart
and
clean
in
the
old
army
he
was
always
considered
one
of
its
best
officers
and
at
the
outbreak
of
these
troubles
he
was
of
the
cavalry
he
was
a
rich
man
but
his
fine
estate
was
one
of
the
first
to
fall
into
the
enemy
hands
i
believe
he
has
never
slept
in
a
house
since
he
has
commanded
the
virginian
army
and
he
invariably
declines
all
offers
of
hospitality
for
fear
the
person
offering
it
may
afterwards
get
into
trouble
for
having
sheltered
the
rebel
general
the
relations
between
him
and
longstreet
are
quite
touching
they
are
almost
always
together
longstreet
corps
complain
of
this
sometimes
as
they
say
that
they
seldom
get
a
chance
of
detached
service
which
falls
to
the
lot
of
ewell
it
is
impossible
to
please
longstreet
more
than
by
praising
lee
i
believe
these
two
generals
to
be
as
little
ambitious
and
as
thoroughly
unselfish
as
any
men
in
the
world
both
long
for
a
successful
termination
of
the
war
in
order
that
they
may
retire
into
obscurity
stonewall
jackson
until
his
death
the
third
in
command
of
their
army
was
just
such
another
servant
of
his
country
it
is
understood
that
general
lee
is
a
religious
man
though
not
so
demonstrative
in
that
respect
as
jackson
and
unlike
his
late
brother
in
arms
he
is
a
member
of
the
church
of
england
his
only
faults
so
far
as
i
can
learn
arise
from
his
excessive
amiability
some
texan
soldiers
were
sent
this
morning
into
chambersburg
to
destroy
a
number
of
barrels
of
excellent
whisky
which
could
not
be
carried
away
this
was
a
pretty
good
trial
for
their
discipline
and
they
did
think
it
rather
hard
lines
that
the
only
time
they
had
been
allowed
into
the
enemy
town
was
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
their
beloved
whisky
however
they
did
their
duty
like
good
soldiers
we
marched
six
miles
on
the
road
towards
gettysburg
and
encamped
at
a
village
called
i
think
greenwood
i
rode
lawley
old
horse
he
and
the
austrian
using
the
doctor
ambulance
in
the
evening
general
longstreet
told
me
that
he
had
just
received
intelligence
that
hooker
had
been
disrated
and
that
meade
was
appointed
in
his
place
of
course
he
knew
both
of
them
in
the
old
army
and
he
says
that
meade
is
an
honourable
and
respectable
man
though
not
perhaps
so
bold
as
hooker
i
had
a
long
talk
with
many
officers
about
the
approaching
battle
which
evidently
can
not
now
be
delayed
long
and
will
take
place
on
this
road
instead
of
in
the
direction
of
harrisburg
as
we
had
supposed
ewell
who
has
laid
york
as
well
as
carlisle
under
contribution
has
been
ordered
to
reunite
every
one
of
course
speaks
with
confidence
i
remarked
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
them
if
on
this
occasion
they
had
cavalry
to
follow
up
the
broken
infantry
in
the
event
of
their
succeeding
in
beating
them
but
to
my
surprise
they
all
spoke
of
their
cavalry
as
not
efficient
for
that
purpose
in
fact
stuart
men
though
excellent
at
making
raids
capturing
waggons
and
stores
and
cutting
off
communications
seem
to
have
no
idea
of
charging
infantry
under
any
circumstances
unlike
the
cavalry
with
bragg
army
they
wear
swords
but
seem
to
have
little
idea
of
using
them
they
hanker
after
their
carbines
and
revolvers
they
constantly
ride
with
their
swords
between
their
left
leg
and
the
saddle
which
has
a
very
funny
appearance
but
their
horses
are
generally
good
and
they
ride
well
the
infantry
and
artillery
of
this
army
do
seem
to
respect
the
cavalry
very
much
and
often
jeer
at
them
i
was
forced
to
abandon
my
horse
here
as
he
was
now
lame
in
three
legs
besides
having
a
very
sore
back
i
never
saw
either
lee
or
longstreet
carry
arms
hill
generally
wears
a
sword
i
observed
this
during
the
three
days
fighting
at
gettysburg
and
in
the
retreat
afterwards
when
every
one
else
looked
and
was
extremely
dirty
wednesday
we
did
not
leave
our
camp
till
noon
as
nearly
all
general
hill
corps
had
to
pass
our
quarters
on
its
march
towards
gettysburg
one
division
of
ewell
also
had
to
join
in
a
little
beyond
greenwood
and
longstreet
corps
had
to
bring
up
the
rear
during
the
morning
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
colonel
walton
who
used
to
command
the
washington
artillery
but
he
is
now
chief
of
artillery
to
longstreet
he
is
a
big
man
auctioneer
in
new
orleans
and
i
understand
he
pines
to
return
to
his
hammer
soon
after
starting
we
got
into
a
pass
in
the
south
mountain
a
continuation
i
believe
of
the
blue
ridge
range
which
is
broken
by
the
potomac
at
harper
ferry
the
scenery
through
the
pass
is
very
fine
the
first
troops
alongside
of
whom
we
rode
belonged
to
division
of
ewell
corps
among
them
i
saw
for
the
first
time
the
celebrated
stonewall
brigade
formerly
commanded
by
jackson
in
appearance
the
men
differ
little
from
other
confederate
soldiers
except
perhaps
that
the
brigade
contains
more
elderly
men
and
fewer
boys
all
except
i
think
one
regiment
are
virginians
as
they
have
nearly
always
been
on
detached
duty
few
of
them
knew
general
longstreet
except
by
reputation
numbers
of
them
asked
me
whether
the
general
in
front
was
longstreet
and
when
i
answered
in
the
affirmative
many
would
run
on
a
hundred
yards
in
order
to
take
a
good
look
at
him
this
i
take
to
be
an
immense
compliment
from
any
soldier
on
a
long
march
at
firing
became
distinctly
audible
in
our
front
but
although
it
increased
as
we
progressed
it
did
not
seem
to
be
very
heavy
a
spy
who
was
with
us
insisted
upon
there
being
a
pretty
tidy
bunch
of
in
or
near
gettysburg
and
he
declared
that
he
was
in
their
society
three
days
ago
after
passing
johnson
division
we
came
up
to
a
florida
brigade
which
is
now
in
hill
corps
but
as
it
had
formerly
served
under
longstreet
the
men
knew
him
well
some
of
them
after
the
general
had
passed
called
out
to
their
comrades
look
out
for
work
now
boys
for
the
old
bulldog
again
at
we
began
to
meet
wounded
men
coming
to
the
rear
and
the
number
of
these
soon
increased
most
rapidly
some
hobbling
alone
others
on
stretchers
carried
by
the
ambulance
corps
and
others
in
the
ambulance
waggons
many
of
the
latter
were
stripped
nearly
naked
and
displayed
very
bad
wounds
this
spectacle
so
revolting
to
a
person
unaccustomed
to
such
sights
produced
no
impression
whatever
upon
the
advancing
troops
who
certainly
go
under
fire
with
the
most
perfect
nonchalance
they
show
no
enthusiasm
or
excitement
but
the
most
complete
indifference
this
is
the
effect
of
two
years
almost
uninterrupted
fighting
we
now
began
to
meet
yankee
prisoners
coming
to
the
rear
in
considerable
numbers
many
of
them
were
wounded
but
they
seemed
already
to
be
on
excellent
terms
with
their
captors
with
whom
they
had
commenced
swapping
canteens
tobacco
among
them
was
a
pennsylvanian
colonel
a
miserable
object
from
a
wound
in
his
face
in
answer
to
a
question
i
heard
one
of
them
remark
with
a
laugh
we
pretty
nigh
whipped
already
we
next
came
to
a
confederate
soldier
carrying
a
yankee
colour
belonging
i
think
to
a
pennsylvanian
regiment
which
he
told
us
he
had
just
captured
at
we
came
in
sight
of
gettysburg
and
joined
general
lee
and
general
hill
who
were
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
ridges
which
form
the
peculiar
feature
of
the
country
round
gettysburg
we
could
see
the
enemy
retreating
up
one
of
the
opposite
ridges
pursued
by
the
confederates
with
loud
yells
the
position
into
which
the
enemy
had
been
driven
was
evidently
a
strong
one
his
right
appeared
to
rest
on
a
cemetery
on
the
top
of
a
high
ridge
to
the
right
of
gettysburg
as
we
looked
at
it
general
hill
now
came
up
and
told
me
he
had
been
very
unwell
all
day
and
in
fact
he
looks
very
delicate
he
said
he
had
had
two
of
his
divisions
engaged
and
had
driven
the
enemy
four
miles
into
his
present
position
capturing
a
great
many
prisoners
some
cannon
and
some
colours
he
said
however
that
the
yankees
had
fought
with
a
determination
unusual
to
them
he
pointed
out
a
railway
cutting
in
which
they
had
made
a
good
stand
also
a
field
in
the
centre
of
which
he
had
seen
a
man
plant
the
regimental
colour
round
which
the
regiment
had
fought
for
some
time
with
much
obstinacy
and
when
at
last
it
was
obliged
to
retreat
the
retired
last
of
all
turning
round
every
now
and
then
to
shake
his
fist
at
the
advancing
rebels
general
hill
said
he
felt
quite
sorry
when
he
saw
this
gallant
yankee
meet
his
doom
general
ewell
had
come
up
at
on
the
enemy
right
with
part
of
his
corps
and
completed
his
discomfiture
general
reynolds
one
of
the
best
yankee
generals
was
reported
killed
whilst
we
were
talking
a
message
arrived
from
general
ewell
requesting
hill
to
press
the
enemy
in
the
front
while
he
performed
the
same
operation
on
his
right
the
pressure
was
accordingly
applied
in
a
mild
degree
but
the
enemy
were
too
strongly
posted
and
it
was
too
late
in
the
evening
for
a
regular
attack
the
town
of
gettysburg
was
now
occupied
by
ewell
and
was
full
of
yankee
dead
and
wounded
i
climbed
up
a
tree
in
the
most
commanding
place
i
could
find
and
could
form
a
pretty
good
general
idea
of
the
enemy
position
although
the
tops
of
the
ridges
being
covered
with
it
was
very
difficult
to
see
anything
of
the
troops
concealed
in
them
the
firing
ceased
about
dark
at
which
time
i
rode
back
with
general
longstreet
and
his
staff
to
his
headquarters
at
cashtown
a
little
village
eight
miles
from
gettysburg
at
that
time
troops
were
pouring
along
the
road
and
were
being
marched
towards
the
position
they
are
to
occupy
in
the
fight
nearly
prisoners
had
been
taken
and
guns
about
men
must
have
been
on
the
field
on
the
confederate
side
the
enemy
had
two
engaged
all
the
prisoners
belong
i
think
to
the
and
corps
this
day
work
is
called
a
brisk
little
scurry
and
all
anticipate
a
big
battle
i
observed
that
the
artillerymen
in
charge
of
the
horses
dig
themselves
little
holes
like
graves
throwing
up
the
earth
at
the
upper
end
they
ensconce
themselves
in
these
holes
when
under
fire
at
supper
this
evening
general
longstreet
spoke
of
the
enemy
position
as
being
very
formidable
he
also
said
that
they
would
doubtless
intrench
themselves
strongly
during
the
night
the
staff
officers
spoke
of
the
battle
as
a
certainty
and
the
universal
feeling
in
the
army
was
one
of
profound
contempt
for
an
enemy
whom
they
have
beaten
so
constantly
and
under
so
many
disadvantages
i
have
the
best
reason
for
supposing
that
the
fight
came
off
prematurely
and
that
neither
lee
nor
longstreet
intended
that
it
should
have
begun
that
day
i
also
think
that
their
plans
were
deranged
by
the
events
of
the
first
thursday
we
all
got
up
at
and
breakfasted
a
little
before
daylight
lawley
insisted
on
riding
notwithstanding
his
illness
captain
and
i
were
in
a
dilemma
for
horses
but
i
was
accommodated
by
major
clark
of
this
staff
whilst
the
stout
austrian
was
mounted
by
major
walton
the
austrian
in
spite
of
the
early
hour
had
shaved
his
cheeks
and
his
mustaches
as
beautifully
as
if
he
was
on
parade
at
vienna
colonel
sorrell
the
austrian
and
i
arrived
at
at
the
same
commanding
position
we
were
on
yesterday
and
i
climbed
up
a
tree
in
company
with
captain
schreibert
of
the
prussian
army
just
below
us
were
seated
generals
lee
hill
longstreet
and
hood
in
consultation
the
two
latter
assisting
their
deliberations
by
the
truly
american
custom
of
sticks
general
heth
was
also
present
he
was
wounded
in
the
head
yesterday
and
although
not
allowed
to
command
his
brigade
he
insists
upon
coming
to
the
field
at
i
rode
over
part
of
the
ground
with
general
longstreet
and
saw
him
disposing
division
for
fight
the
enemy
occupied
a
series
of
high
ridges
the
tops
of
which
were
covered
with
trees
but
the
intervening
valleys
between
their
ridges
and
ours
were
mostly
open
and
partly
under
cultivation
the
cemetery
was
on
their
right
and
their
left
appeared
to
rest
upon
a
high
rocky
hill
the
enemy
forces
which
were
now
supposed
to
comprise
nearly
the
whole
potomac
army
were
concentrated
into
a
space
apparently
not
more
than
a
couple
of
miles
in
length
the
confederates
enclosed
them
in
a
sort
of
semicircle
and
the
extreme
extent
of
our
position
must
have
been
from
five
to
six
miles
at
least
ewell
was
on
our
left
his
headquarters
in
a
church
with
a
high
cupola
at
gettysburg
hill
in
the
centre
and
longstreet
on
the
right
our
ridges
were
also
covered
with
at
the
tops
and
generally
on
the
rear
slopes
the
artillery
of
both
sides
confronted
each
other
at
the
edges
of
these
belts
of
trees
the
troops
being
completely
hidden
the
enemy
was
evidently
intrenched
but
the
southerns
had
not
broken
ground
at
all
a
dead
silence
reigned
till
and
no
one
would
have
imagined
that
such
masses
of
men
and
such
a
powerful
artillery
were
about
to
commence
the
work
of
destruction
at
that
hour
only
two
divisions
of
longstreet
were
present
and
hood
pickett
being
still
in
the
rear
as
the
whole
morning
was
evidently
to
be
occupied
in
disposing
the
troops
for
the
attack
i
rode
to
the
extreme
right
with
colonel
manning
and
major
walton
where
we
ate
quantities
of
cherries
and
got
a
feed
of
corn
for
our
horses
we
also
bathed
in
a
small
stream
but
not
without
some
trepidation
on
my
part
for
we
were
almost
beyond
the
lines
and
were
exposed
to
the
cavalry
at
i
met
a
quantity
of
yankee
prisoners
who
had
been
picked
up
straggling
they
told
me
they
belonged
to
sickles
corps
i
think
and
had
arrived
from
emmetsburg
during
the
night
about
this
time
skirmishing
began
along
part
of
the
line
but
not
heavily
at
general
longstreet
advised
me
if
i
wished
to
have
a
good
view
of
the
battle
to
return
to
my
tree
of
yesterday
i
did
so
and
remained
there
with
lawley
and
captain
schreibert
during
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
but
until
all
was
profoundly
still
and
we
began
to
doubt
whether
a
fight
was
coming
off
at
all
at
that
time
however
longstreet
suddenly
commenced
a
heavy
cannonade
on
the
right
ewell
immediately
took
it
up
on
the
left
the
enemy
replied
with
at
least
equal
fury
and
in
a
few
moments
the
firing
along
the
whole
line
was
as
heavy
as
it
is
possible
to
conceive
a
dense
smoke
arose
for
six
miles
there
was
little
wind
to
drive
it
away
and
the
air
seemed
full
of
shells
each
of
which
appeared
to
have
a
different
style
of
going
and
to
make
a
different
noise
from
the
others
the
ordnance
on
both
sides
is
of
a
very
varied
description
every
now
and
then
a
caisson
would
blow
up
if
a
federal
one
a
confederate
yell
would
immediately
follow
the
southern
troops
when
charging
or
to
express
their
delight
always
yell
in
a
manner
peculiar
to
themselves
the
yankee
cheer
is
much
more
like
ours
but
the
confederate
officers
declare
that
the
rebel
yell
has
a
particular
merit
and
always
produces
a
salutary
and
useful
effect
upon
their
adversaries
a
corps
is
sometimes
spoken
of
as
a
good
yelling
regiment
so
soon
as
the
firing
began
general
lee
joined
hill
just
below
our
tree
and
he
remained
there
nearly
all
the
time
looking
through
his
sometimes
talking
to
hill
and
sometimes
to
colonel
long
of
his
staff
but
generally
he
sat
quite
alone
on
the
stump
of
a
tree
what
i
remarked
especially
was
that
during
the
whole
time
the
firing
continued
he
only
sent
one
message
and
only
received
one
report
it
is
evidently
his
system
to
arrange
the
plan
thoroughly
with
the
three
corps
commanders
and
then
leave
to
them
the
duty
of
modifying
and
carrying
it
out
to
the
best
of
their
abilities
when
the
cannonade
was
at
its
height
a
confederate
band
of
music
between
the
cemetery
and
ourselves
began
to
play
polkas
and
waltzes
which
sounded
very
curious
accompanied
by
the
hissing
and
bursting
of
the
shells
at
all
became
comparatively
quiet
on
our
left
and
in
the
cemetery
but
volleys
of
musketry
on
the
right
told
us
that
longstreet
infantry
were
advancing
and
the
onward
progress
of
the
smoke
showed
that
he
was
progressing
favourably
but
about
there
seemed
to
be
a
check
and
even
a
slight
retrograde
movement
soon
after
general
lee
got
a
report
by
signal
from
longstreet
to
say
are
doing
a
little
before
dark
the
firing
dropped
off
in
every
direction
and
soon
ceased
altogether
we
then
received
intelligence
that
longstreet
had
carried
everything
before
him
for
some
time
capturing
several
batteries
and
driving
the
enemy
from
his
positions
but
when
hill
florida
brigade
and
some
other
troops
gave
way
he
was
forced
to
abandon
a
small
portion
of
the
ground
he
had
won
together
with
all
the
captured
guns
except
three
his
troops
however
bivouacked
during
the
night
on
ground
occupied
by
the
enemy
this
morning
every
one
deplores
that
longstreet
expose
himself
in
such
a
reckless
manner
he
led
a
georgian
regiment
in
a
charge
against
a
battery
hat
in
hand
and
in
front
of
everybody
general
barksdale
was
killed
and
semmes
mortally
wounded
but
the
most
serious
loss
was
that
of
general
hood
who
was
badly
wounded
in
the
arm
early
in
the
day
i
heard
that
his
texans
are
in
despair
lawley
and
i
rode
back
to
the
general
camp
which
had
been
moved
to
within
a
mile
of
the
scene
of
action
longstreet
however
with
most
of
his
staff
bivouacked
on
the
field
major
fairfax
arrived
at
about
in
a
very
bad
humour
he
had
under
his
charge
about
to
yankee
prisoners
who
had
been
taken
among
them
a
general
whom
i
heard
one
of
his
men
accusing
of
having
been
so
g
d
d
d
drunk
that
he
had
turned
his
guns
upon
his
own
men
but
on
the
other
hand
the
accuser
was
such
a
thundering
blackguard
and
proposed
taking
such
a
variety
of
oaths
in
order
to
escape
from
the
army
that
he
is
not
worthy
of
much
credit
a
large
train
of
horses
and
mules
arrived
sent
in
by
general
stuart
and
captured
it
is
understood
by
his
cavalry
which
had
penetrated
to
within
six
miles
of
washington
friday
at
i
rode
to
the
field
with
colonel
manning
and
went
over
that
portion
of
the
ground
which
after
a
fierce
contest
had
been
won
from
the
enemy
yesterday
evening
the
dead
were
being
buried
but
great
numbers
were
still
lying
about
also
many
mortally
wounded
for
whom
nothing
could
be
done
amongst
the
latter
were
a
number
of
yankees
dressed
in
bad
imitations
of
the
zouave
costume
they
opened
their
glazed
eyes
as
i
rode
past
in
a
painfully
imploring
manner
we
joined
generals
lee
and
longstreet
staff
they
were
reconnoitring
and
making
preparations
for
renewing
the
attack
as
we
formed
a
pretty
large
party
we
often
drew
upon
ourselves
the
attention
of
the
hostile
sharpshooters
and
were
two
or
three
times
favoured
with
a
shell
one
of
these
shells
set
a
brick
building
on
fire
which
was
situated
between
the
lines
this
building
was
filled
with
wounded
principally
yankees
who
i
am
afraid
must
have
perished
miserably
in
the
flames
colonel
sorrell
had
been
slightly
wounded
yesterday
but
still
did
duty
major
horse
was
killed
but
there
were
no
other
casualties
amongst
my
particular
friends
the
plan
of
yesterday
attack
seems
to
have
been
very
simple
first
a
heavy
cannonade
all
along
the
line
followed
by
an
advance
of
longstreet
two
divisions
and
part
of
hill
corps
in
consequence
of
the
enemy
having
been
driven
back
some
distance
longstreet
corps
part
of
it
was
in
a
much
more
forward
situation
than
yesterday
but
the
range
of
heights
to
be
gained
was
still
most
formidable
and
evidently
strongly
intrenched
the
distance
between
the
confederate
guns
and
the
yankee
position
between
the
woods
crowning
the
opposite
ridges
was
at
least
a
mile
quite
open
gently
undulating
and
exposed
to
artillery
the
whole
distance
this
was
the
ground
which
had
to
be
crossed
in
attack
pickett
division
which
had
just
come
up
was
to
bear
the
brunt
in
longstreet
attack
together
with
heth
and
pettigrew
in
hill
corps
pickett
division
was
a
weak
one
under
owing
to
the
absence
of
two
brigades
at
noon
all
longstreet
dispositions
were
made
his
troops
for
attack
were
deployed
into
line
and
lying
down
in
the
woods
his
batteries
were
ready
to
open
the
general
then
dismounted
and
went
to
sleep
for
a
short
time
the
austrian
officer
and
i
now
rode
off
to
get
if
possible
into
some
commanding
position
from
whence
we
could
see
the
whole
thing
without
being
exposed
to
the
tremendous
fire
which
was
about
to
commence
after
riding
about
for
half
an
hour
without
being
able
to
discover
so
desirable
a
situation
we
determined
to
make
for
the
cupola
near
gettysburg
ewell
headquarters
just
before
we
reached
the
entrance
to
the
town
the
cannonade
opened
with
a
fury
which
surpassed
even
that
of
yesterday
soon
after
passing
through
the
at
the
entrance
of
gettysburg
we
found
that
we
had
got
into
a
heavy
shells
both
federal
and
confederate
passing
over
our
heads
with
great
frequency
at
length
two
shrapnel
shells
burst
quite
close
to
us
and
a
ball
from
one
of
them
hit
the
officer
who
was
conducting
us
we
then
turned
round
and
changed
our
views
with
regard
to
the
cupola
the
fire
of
one
side
being
bad
enough
but
preferable
to
that
of
both
sides
a
small
boy
of
twelve
years
was
riding
with
us
at
the
time
this
urchin
took
a
diabolical
interest
in
the
bursting
of
the
shells
and
screamed
with
delight
when
he
saw
them
take
effect
i
never
saw
this
boy
again
or
found
out
who
he
was
the
road
at
gettysburg
was
lined
with
yankee
dead
and
as
they
had
been
killed
on
the
the
poor
fellows
had
already
begun
to
be
very
offensive
we
then
returned
to
the
hill
i
was
on
yesterday
but
finding
that
to
see
the
actual
fighting
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
go
into
the
thick
of
the
thing
i
determined
to
make
my
way
to
general
longstreet
it
was
then
about
after
passing
general
lee
and
his
staff
i
rode
on
through
the
woods
in
the
direction
in
which
i
had
left
longstreet
i
soon
began
to
meet
many
wounded
men
returning
from
the
front
many
of
them
asked
in
piteous
tones
the
way
to
a
doctor
or
an
ambulance
the
further
i
got
the
greater
became
the
number
of
the
wounded
at
last
i
came
to
a
perfect
stream
of
them
flocking
through
the
woods
in
numbers
as
great
as
the
crowd
in
oxford
street
in
the
middle
of
the
day
some
were
walking
alone
on
crutches
composed
of
two
rifles
others
were
supported
by
men
less
badly
wounded
than
themselves
and
others
were
carried
on
stretchers
by
the
ambulance
corps
but
in
no
case
did
i
see
a
sound
man
helping
the
wounded
to
the
rear
unless
he
carried
the
red
badge
of
the
ambulance
corps
they
were
still
under
a
heavy
fire
the
shells
were
continually
bringing
down
great
limbs
of
trees
and
carrying
further
destruction
amongst
this
melancholy
procession
i
saw
all
this
in
much
less
time
than
it
takes
to
write
it
and
although
astonished
to
meet
such
vast
numbers
of
wounded
i
had
not
seen
to
give
me
any
idea
of
the
real
extent
of
the
mischief
when
i
got
close
up
to
general
longstreet
i
saw
one
of
his
regiments
advancing
through
the
woods
in
good
order
so
thinking
i
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
attack
i
remarked
to
the
general
that
would
have
missed
this
for
longstreet
was
seated
at
the
top
of
a
snake
fence
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
looking
perfectly
calm
and
imperturbed
he
replied
laughing
devil
you
would
i
would
like
to
have
missed
it
very
much
we
attacked
and
been
repulsed
look
there
for
the
first
time
i
then
had
a
view
of
the
open
space
between
the
two
positions
and
saw
it
covered
with
confederates
slowly
and
sulkily
returning
towards
us
in
small
broken
parties
under
a
heavy
fire
of
artillery
but
the
fire
where
we
were
was
not
so
bad
as
further
to
the
rear
for
although
the
air
seemed
alive
with
shell
yet
the
greater
number
burst
behind
us
the
general
told
me
that
pickett
division
had
succeeded
in
carrying
the
enemy
position
and
capturing
his
guns
but
after
remaining
there
twenty
minutes
it
had
been
forced
to
retire
on
the
retreat
of
heth
and
pettigrew
on
its
left
no
person
could
have
been
more
calm
or
than
general
longstreet
under
these
trying
circumstances
aggravated
as
they
now
were
by
the
movements
of
the
enemy
who
began
to
show
a
strong
disposition
to
advance
i
could
now
thoroughly
appreciate
the
term
bulldog
which
i
had
heard
applied
to
him
by
the
soldiers
difficulties
seem
to
make
no
other
impression
upon
him
than
to
make
him
a
little
more
savage
major
walton
was
the
only
officer
with
him
when
i
came
up
all
the
rest
had
been
put
into
the
charge
in
a
few
minutes
major
latrobe
arrived
on
foot
carrying
his
saddle
having
just
had
his
horse
killed
colonel
sorrell
was
also
in
the
same
predicament
and
captain
goree
horse
was
wounded
in
the
mouth
the
general
was
making
the
best
arrangements
in
his
power
to
resist
the
threatened
advance
by
advancing
some
artillery
rallying
the
stragglers
i
remember
seeing
a
general
pettigrew
i
think
it
was
come
up
to
him
and
report
that
he
was
unable
to
bring
his
men
up
again
longstreet
turned
upon
him
and
replied
with
some
sarcasm
well
never
mind
then
general
just
let
them
remain
where
they
are
the
enemy
going
to
advance
and
will
spare
you
the
he
asked
for
something
to
drink
i
gave
him
some
rum
out
of
my
silver
flask
which
i
begged
he
would
keep
in
remembrance
of
the
occasion
he
smiled
and
to
my
great
satisfaction
accepted
the
memorial
he
then
went
off
to
give
some
orders
to
division
soon
afterwards
i
joined
general
lee
who
had
in
the
meanwhile
come
to
that
part
of
the
field
on
becoming
aware
of
the
disaster
if
longstreet
conduct
was
admirable
that
of
general
lee
was
perfectly
sublime
he
was
engaged
in
rallying
and
in
encouraging
the
broken
troops
and
was
riding
about
a
little
in
front
of
the
wood
quite
alone
the
whole
of
his
staff
being
engaged
in
a
similar
manner
further
to
the
rear
his
face
which
is
always
placid
and
cheerful
did
not
show
signs
of
the
slightest
disappointment
care
or
annoyance
and
he
was
addressing
to
every
soldier
he
met
a
few
words
of
encouragement
such
as
all
this
will
come
right
in
the
end
we
talk
it
over
afterwards
but
in
the
mean
time
all
good
men
must
rally
we
want
all
good
and
true
men
just
now
he
spoke
to
all
the
wounded
men
that
passed
him
and
the
slightly
wounded
he
exhorted
to
bind
up
their
hurts
and
take
up
a
musket
in
this
emergency
very
few
failed
to
answer
his
appeal
and
i
saw
many
badly
wounded
men
take
off
their
hats
and
cheer
him
he
said
to
me
this
has
been
a
sad
day
for
us
colonel
a
sad
day
but
we
ca
expect
always
to
gain
victories
he
was
also
kind
enough
to
advise
me
to
get
into
some
more
sheltered
position
as
the
shells
were
bursting
round
us
with
considerable
frequency
notwithstanding
the
misfortune
which
had
so
suddenly
befallen
him
general
lee
seemed
to
observe
everything
however
trivial
when
a
mounted
officer
began
licking
his
horse
for
shying
at
the
bursting
of
a
shell
he
called
out
do
whip
him
captain
do
whip
him
i
got
just
such
another
foolish
horse
myself
and
whipping
does
no
good
i
happened
to
see
a
man
lying
flat
on
his
face
in
a
small
ditch
and
i
remarked
that
i
did
think
he
seemed
dead
this
drew
general
attention
to
the
man
who
commenced
groaning
dismally
finding
appeals
to
his
patriotism
of
no
avail
general
lee
had
him
ignominiously
set
on
his
legs
by
some
neighbouring
gunners
i
saw
general
willcox
an
officer
who
wears
a
short
round
jacket
and
a
battered
straw
hat
come
up
to
him
and
explain
almost
crying
the
state
of
his
brigade
general
lee
immediately
shook
hands
with
him
and
said
cheerfully
never
mind
general
this
has
my
it
is
that
have
lost
this
fight
and
you
must
help
me
out
of
it
in
the
best
way
you
can
in
this
manner
i
saw
general
lee
encourage
and
reanimate
his
somewhat
dispirited
troops
and
magnanimously
take
upon
his
own
shoulders
the
whole
weight
of
the
repulse
it
was
impossible
to
look
at
him
or
to
listen
to
him
without
feeling
the
strongest
admiration
and
i
never
saw
any
man
fail
him
except
the
man
in
the
ditch
it
is
difficult
to
exaggerate
the
critical
state
of
affairs
as
they
appeared
about
this
time
if
the
enemy
or
their
general
had
shown
any
enterprise
there
is
no
saying
what
might
have
happened
general
lee
and
his
officers
were
evidently
fully
impressed
with
a
sense
of
the
situation
yet
there
was
much
less
noise
fuss
or
confusion
of
orders
than
at
an
ordinary
the
men
as
they
were
rallied
in
the
wood
were
brought
up
in
detachments
and
lay
down
quietly
and
coolly
in
the
positions
assigned
to
them
we
heard
that
generals
garnett
and
armistead
were
killed
and
general
kemper
mortally
wounded
also
that
pickett
division
had
only
one
unhurt
nearly
all
this
slaughter
took
place
in
an
open
space
about
one
mile
square
and
within
one
hour
at
we
heard
a
long
and
continuous
yankee
cheer
which
we
at
first
imagined
was
an
indication
of
an
advance
but
it
turned
out
to
be
their
reception
of
a
general
officer
whom
we
saw
riding
down
the
line
followed
by
about
thirty
horsemen
soon
afterwards
i
rode
to
the
extreme
front
where
there
were
four
pieces
of
rifled
cannon
almost
without
any
infantry
support
to
the
of
these
guns
is
to
be
attributed
the
otherwise
surprising
inactivity
of
the
enemy
i
was
immediately
surrounded
by
a
sergeant
and
about
gunners
who
seemed
in
excellent
spirits
and
full
of
confidence
in
spite
of
their
exposed
situation
the
sergeant
expressed
his
ardent
hope
that
the
yankees
might
have
spirit
enough
to
advance
and
receive
the
dose
he
had
in
readiness
for
them
they
spoke
in
admiration
of
the
advance
of
pickett
division
and
of
the
manner
in
which
pickett
himself
had
led
it
when
they
observed
general
lee
they
said
we
not
lost
confidence
in
the
old
man
this
day
work
wo
do
him
no
harm
will
get
us
into
washington
yet
you
bet
he
will
whilst
we
were
talking
the
enemy
skirmishers
began
to
advance
slowly
and
several
ominous
sounds
in
quick
succession
told
us
that
we
were
attracting
their
attention
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
break
up
the
conclave
i
therefore
turned
round
and
took
leave
of
these
cheery
and
plucky
gunners
at
general
lee
received
a
report
that
johnson
division
of
ewell
corps
had
been
successful
on
the
left
and
had
gained
important
advantages
there
firing
entirely
ceased
in
our
front
about
this
time
but
we
now
heard
some
brisk
musketry
on
our
right
which
i
afterwards
learned
proceeded
from
hood
texans
who
had
managed
to
surround
some
enterprising
yankee
cavalry
and
were
slaughtering
them
with
great
satisfaction
only
eighteen
out
of
four
hundred
are
said
to
have
escaped
at
all
idea
of
a
yankee
attack
being
over
i
rode
back
to
tent
and
found
that
worthy
commissary
in
very
low
spirits
all
sorts
of
exaggerated
rumours
having
reached
him
on
my
way
i
met
a
great
many
wounded
men
most
anxious
to
inquire
after
longstreet
who
was
reported
killed
when
i
assured
them
he
was
quite
well
they
seemed
to
forget
their
own
pain
in
the
evident
pleasure
they
felt
in
the
safety
of
their
chief
no
words
that
i
can
use
will
adequately
express
the
extraordinary
patience
and
fortitude
with
which
the
wounded
confederates
bore
their
sufferings
i
got
something
to
eat
with
the
doctors
at
the
first
for
fifteen
hours
i
gave
up
my
horse
to
his
owner
as
from
death
and
exhaustion
the
staff
are
almost
without
horses
this
officer
was
afterwards
killed
at
the
passage
of
the
potomac
saturday
i
was
awoke
at
daylight
by
moses
complaining
that
his
valuable
trunk
containing
much
public
money
had
been
stolen
from
our
tent
whilst
we
slept
after
a
search
it
was
found
in
a
wood
hard
by
broken
open
and
minus
the
money
dr
barksdale
had
been
robbed
in
the
same
manner
exactly
this
is
evidently
the
work
of
those
rascally
stragglers
who
shirk
going
under
fire
plunder
the
natives
and
will
hereafter
swagger
as
the
heroes
of
gettysburg
lawley
the
austrian
and
i
walked
up
to
the
front
about
eight
and
on
our
way
we
met
general
longstreet
who
was
in
a
high
state
of
amusement
and
a
flag
of
truce
had
just
come
over
from
the
enemy
and
its
bearer
announced
among
other
things
that
general
longstreet
was
wounded
and
a
prisoner
but
would
be
taken
care
of
general
longstreet
sent
back
word
that
he
was
extremely
grateful
but
that
being
neither
wounded
nor
a
prisoner
he
was
quite
able
to
take
care
of
himself
the
iron
endurance
of
general
longstreet
is
most
extraordinary
he
seems
to
require
neither
food
nor
sleep
most
of
his
staff
now
fall
fast
asleep
directly
they
get
off
their
horses
they
are
so
exhausted
from
the
last
three
days
work
whilst
lawley
went
to
headquarters
on
business
i
sat
down
and
had
a
long
talk
with
general
pendleton
the
parson
chief
of
artillery
he
told
me
the
exact
number
of
guns
in
action
yesterday
he
said
that
the
universal
opinion
is
in
favour
of
the
napoleon
guns
as
the
best
and
simplest
sort
of
ordnance
for
field
purposes
nearly
all
the
artillery
with
this
army
has
either
been
captured
from
the
enemy
or
cast
from
old
taken
at
the
early
part
of
the
war
at
lawley
returned
from
headquarters
bringing
the
news
that
the
army
is
to
commence
moving
in
the
direction
of
virginia
this
evening
this
step
is
imperative
from
want
of
ammunition
but
it
was
hoped
that
the
enemy
might
attack
during
the
day
especially
as
this
is
the
july
and
it
was
calculated
that
there
was
still
ammunition
for
one
day
fighting
the
ordnance
train
had
already
commenced
moving
back
towards
cashtown
and
ewell
immense
train
of
plunder
had
been
proceeding
towards
hagerstown
by
the
fairfield
road
ever
since
an
early
hour
this
morning
johnson
division
had
evacuated
during
the
night
the
position
it
had
gained
yesterday
it
appears
that
for
a
time
it
was
actually
in
possession
of
the
cemetery
but
had
been
forced
to
retire
from
thence
from
want
of
support
by
pender
division
which
had
been
retarded
by
that
officer
wound
the
whole
of
our
left
was
therefore
thrown
back
considerably
at
the
rain
began
to
descend
in
torrents
and
we
took
refuge
in
the
hovel
of
an
ignorant
pennsylvanian
boor
the
cottage
was
full
of
soldiers
none
of
whom
had
the
slightest
idea
of
the
contemplated
retreat
and
all
were
talking
of
washington
and
baltimore
with
the
greatest
confidence
at
we
walked
to
general
longstreet
camp
which
had
been
removed
to
a
place
three
miles
distant
on
the
fairfield
road
general
longstreet
talked
to
me
for
a
long
time
about
the
battle
he
said
the
mistake
they
had
made
was
in
not
concentrating
the
army
more
and
making
the
attack
yesterday
with
men
instead
of
the
advance
had
been
in
three
lines
and
the
troops
of
hill
corps
who
gave
way
were
young
soldiers
who
had
never
been
under
fire
before
he
thought
the
enemy
would
have
attacked
had
the
guns
been
withdrawn
had
they
done
so
at
that
particular
moment
immediately
after
the
repulse
it
would
have
been
awkward
but
in
that
case
he
had
given
orders
for
the
advance
of
hood
division
and
on
the
right
i
think
after
all
that
general
meade
was
right
not
to
advance
his
men
would
never
have
stood
the
tremendous
fire
of
artillery
they
would
have
been
exposed
to
rather
over
yankees
were
captured
during
the
three
days
took
the
parole
the
remainder
were
now
being
marched
to
richmond
escorted
by
the
remains
of
pickett
division
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
seeing
that
the
cause
of
this
check
to
the
confederates
lies
in
the
utter
contempt
felt
for
the
enemy
by
all
ranks
waggons
horses
mules
and
cattle
captured
in
pennsylvania
the
solid
advantages
of
this
campaign
have
been
passing
slowly
along
this
road
fairfield
all
day
those
taken
by
ewell
are
particularly
admired
so
interminable
was
this
train
that
it
soon
became
evident
that
we
should
not
be
able
to
start
till
late
at
night
as
soon
as
it
became
dark
we
all
lay
round
a
big
fire
and
i
heard
reports
coming
in
from
the
different
generals
that
the
enemy
was
and
had
been
doing
so
all
day
long
reported
nothing
in
his
front
but
cavalry
videttes
but
this
of
course
could
make
no
difference
to
general
lee
plans
ammunition
he
must
have
he
had
failed
to
capture
it
from
the
enemy
according
to
precedent
and
as
his
communications
with
virginia
were
intercepted
he
was
compelled
to
fall
back
towards
winchester
and
draw
his
supplies
from
thence
general
milroy
had
kindly
left
an
ample
stock
at
that
town
when
he
made
his
precipitate
exit
some
weeks
ago
the
army
was
also
encumbered
with
an
enormous
the
spoils
of
pennsylvania
which
it
is
highly
desirable
to
get
safely
over
the
potomac
shortly
after
the
rain
began
to
descend
in
torrents
lawley
and
i
luckily
got
into
the
doctors
covered
buggy
and
began
to
get
slowly
under
way
a
little
after
midnight
the
napoleon
are
brass
guns
with
chambers
very
light
and
with
long
range
they
were
invented
or
recommended
by
louis
napoleon
years
ago
a
large
number
are
being
cast
at
augusta
and
elsewhere
sunday
the
night
was
very
bad
thunder
and
lightning
torrents
of
rain
the
road
in
mud
and
water
and
often
blocked
up
with
waggons
come
to
grief
i
pitied
the
wretched
plight
of
the
unfortunate
soldiers
who
were
to
follow
us
our
progress
was
naturally
very
slow
indeed
and
we
took
eight
hours
to
go
as
many
miles
at
we
halted
a
little
beyond
the
village
of
fairfield
near
the
entrance
to
a
no
sooner
had
we
done
so
and
lit
a
fire
than
an
alarm
was
spread
that
yankee
cavalry
were
upon
us
several
shots
flew
over
our
heads
but
we
never
could
discover
from
whence
they
came
news
also
arrived
of
the
capture
of
the
whole
of
ewell
beautiful
waggons
these
reports
created
a
regular
stampede
amongst
the
waggoners
and
longstreet
drivers
started
off
as
fast
as
they
could
go
our
medical
trio
however
firmly
declined
to
budge
and
came
to
this
wise
conclusion
partly
urged
by
the
pangs
of
hunger
and
partly
from
the
consideration
that
if
the
yankee
cavalry
did
come
the
crowded
state
of
the
road
in
our
rear
would
prevent
our
escape
soon
afterwards
some
confederate
cavalry
were
pushed
to
the
front
who
cleared
the
pass
after
a
slight
skirmish
at
noon
generals
lee
and
longstreet
arrived
and
halted
close
to
us
soon
afterwards
ewell
came
up
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
him
he
is
rather
a
old
soldier
with
a
bald
head
a
prominent
nose
and
rather
a
haggard
sickly
face
having
so
lately
lost
his
leg
above
the
knee
he
is
still
a
complete
cripple
and
falls
off
his
horse
occasionally
directly
he
dismounts
he
has
to
be
put
on
crutches
he
was
stonewall
jackson
coadjutor
during
the
celebrated
valley
campaigns
and
he
used
to
be
a
great
swearer
in
fact
he
is
said
to
have
been
the
only
person
who
was
unable
to
restrain
that
propensity
before
jackson
but
since
his
late
rather
romantic
marriage
he
has
to
use
the
american
expression
the
when
i
saw
him
he
was
in
a
great
state
of
disgust
in
consequence
of
the
supposed
loss
of
his
waggons
and
refused
to
be
comforted
by
general
lee
i
joined
longstreet
again
and
mounted
on
lawley
venerable
horse
started
at
to
ride
through
the
pass
at
we
stopped
at
a
place
where
the
roads
fork
one
leading
to
emmetsburg
and
the
other
to
hagerstown
major
moses
and
i
entered
a
farmhouse
in
which
we
found
several
women
two
wounded
yankees
and
one
dead
one
the
result
of
this
morning
skirmish
one
of
the
sufferers
was
frightfully
wounded
in
the
head
the
other
was
hit
in
the
knee
the
latter
told
me
he
was
an
irishman
and
had
served
in
the
bengal
europeans
during
the
indian
mutiny
he
now
belonged
to
a
michigan
cavalry
regiment
and
had
already
imbibed
american
ideas
of
ireland
wrongs
and
all
that
sort
of
trash
he
told
me
that
his
officers
were
very
bad
and
that
the
idea
in
the
army
was
that
had
assumed
the
chief
command
the
women
in
this
house
were
great
abolitionists
when
major
fairfax
rode
up
he
inquired
of
one
of
them
whether
the
corpse
was
that
of
a
confederate
or
yankee
the
body
was
in
the
verandah
covered
with
a
white
sheet
the
woman
made
a
gesture
with
her
foot
and
replied
if
it
was
a
rebel
do
you
think
it
would
be
here
long
fairfax
then
said
is
it
a
woman
who
speaks
in
such
a
manner
of
a
dead
body
which
can
do
no
one
any
harm
she
thereupon
coloured
up
and
said
she
was
in
earnest
at
we
rode
on
again
by
the
hagerstown
road
and
came
up
with
general
longstreet
at
the
road
was
full
of
soldiers
marching
in
a
particularly
lively
manner
the
wet
and
mud
seemed
to
have
produced
no
effect
whatever
on
their
spirits
which
were
as
boisterous
as
ever
they
had
got
hold
of
coloured
prints
of
mr
lincoln
which
they
were
passing
about
from
company
to
company
with
many
remarks
upon
the
personal
beauty
of
uncle
abe
the
same
old
chaff
was
going
on
of
come
out
of
that
hat
i
know
you
in
it
i
sees
your
legs
down
when
we
halted
for
the
night
skirmishing
was
going
on
in
front
and
rear
stuart
in
front
and
ewell
in
rear
our
bivouac
being
near
a
large
tavern
general
longstreet
had
ordered
some
supper
there
for
himself
and
his
staff
but
when
we
went
to
devour
it
we
discovered
general
and
his
officers
rapidly
finishing
it
we
however
soon
got
more
the
pennsylvanian
proprietors
being
particularly
anxious
to
propitiate
the
general
in
hopes
that
he
would
spare
their
live
stock
which
had
been
condemned
to
death
by
the
ruthless
moses
during
supper
women
came
rushing
in
at
intervals
saying
oh
good
heavens
now
they
killing
our
fat
hogs
which
is
the
general
which
is
the
great
officer
our
milch
cows
are
now
going
to
all
which
expressions
longstreet
replied
shaking
his
head
in
a
melancholy
manner
yes
madam
it
very
sad
very
sad
and
this
sort
of
thing
has
been
going
on
in
virginia
more
than
two
years
very
sad
we
all
slept
in
the
open
and
the
heavy
rain
produced
no
effect
upon
our
slumbers
i
understand
it
is
impossible
to
cross
the
lines
by
flag
of
truce
i
therefore
find
myself
in
a
dilemma
about
the
expiration
of
my
leave
it
afterwards
turned
out
that
all
escaped
but
monday
several
horses
were
stolen
last
night
mine
nearly
so
it
is
necessary
to
be
very
careful
in
order
to
prevent
this
misfortune
we
started
at
but
got
on
very
slowly
so
blocked
up
was
the
road
with
waggons
some
of
which
had
been
captured
and
burnt
by
the
enemy
yesterday
it
now
turned
out
that
all
ewell
waggons
escaped
except
although
at
one
time
they
had
been
all
in
the
enemy
hands
at
we
halted
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
generals
lee
longstreet
hill
and
willcox
had
a
consultation
i
spoke
to
about
my
difficulties
with
regard
to
getting
home
and
the
necessity
of
doing
so
owing
to
the
approaching
expiration
of
my
leave
he
told
me
that
the
army
had
no
intention
at
present
of
retreating
for
good
and
advised
me
to
stop
with
them
and
see
what
turned
up
he
also
said
that
some
of
the
enemy
despatches
had
been
intercepted
in
which
the
following
words
occur
the
noble
but
unfortunate
army
of
the
potomac
has
again
been
obliged
to
retreat
before
superior
numbers
i
particularly
observed
the
marching
of
the
mississippi
which
was
uncommonly
good
this
regiment
all
wear
short
round
jackets
a
most
unusual
circumstance
for
they
are
generally
unpopular
in
the
south
at
we
halted
again
and
all
set
to
work
to
eat
cherries
which
was
the
only
food
we
got
between
and
i
saw
a
most
laughable
spectacle
this
afternoon
a
negro
dressed
in
full
yankee
uniform
with
a
rifle
at
full
cock
leading
along
a
barefooted
white
man
with
whom
he
had
evidently
changed
clothes
general
longstreet
stopped
the
pair
and
asked
the
black
man
what
it
meant
he
replied
the
two
soldiers
in
charge
of
this
here
yank
have
got
drunk
so
for
fear
he
should
escape
i
have
took
care
of
him
and
brought
him
through
that
little
town
the
consequential
manner
of
the
negro
and
the
supreme
contempt
with
which
he
spoke
to
his
prisoner
were
most
amusing
this
little
episode
of
a
southern
slave
leading
a
white
yankee
soldier
through
a
northern
village
and
of
his
own
would
not
have
been
gratifying
to
an
abolitionist
nor
would
the
sympathisers
both
in
england
and
in
the
north
feel
encouraged
if
they
could
hear
the
language
of
detestation
and
contempt
with
which
the
numerous
negroes
with
the
southern
armies
speak
of
their
liberators
i
saw
general
hood
in
his
carriage
he
looked
rather
bad
and
has
been
suffering
a
good
deal
the
doctors
seem
to
doubt
whether
they
will
be
able
to
save
his
arm
i
also
saw
general
hampton
of
the
cavalry
who
has
been
shot
in
the
hip
and
has
two
on
the
head
but
he
was
in
very
good
spirits
a
short
time
before
we
reached
hagerstown
there
was
some
firing
in
front
together
with
an
alarm
that
the
yankee
cavalry
was
upon
us
the
ambulances
were
sent
back
but
some
of
the
wounded
jumped
out
and
producing
the
rifles
which
they
had
not
parted
with
they
prepared
to
fight
after
a
good
deal
of
desultory
skirmishing
we
seated
ourselves
upon
a
hill
overlooking
hagerstown
and
saw
the
enemy
cavalry
driven
through
the
town
pursued
by
yelling
confederates
a
good
many
yankee
prisoners
now
passed
us
one
of
them
who
was
smoking
a
cigar
was
a
lieutenant
of
cavalry
dressed
very
smartly
and
his
hair
brushed
with
the
greatest
care
he
formed
rather
a
contrast
to
his
ragged
escort
and
to
ourselves
who
had
not
washed
or
shaved
for
ever
so
long
about
we
rode
through
hagerstown
in
the
streets
of
which
were
several
dead
horses
and
a
few
dead
men
after
proceeding
about
a
mile
beyond
the
town
we
halted
and
general
longstreet
sent
four
cavalrymen
up
a
lane
with
directions
to
report
everything
they
saw
we
then
dismounted
and
lay
down
about
ten
minutes
later
being
nearly
dark
we
heard
a
sudden
rush
a
panic
and
then
a
regular
stampede
commenced
in
the
midst
of
which
i
descried
our
four
cavalry
heroes
crossing
a
field
as
fast
as
they
could
gallop
all
was
now
complete
confusion
officers
mounting
their
horses
and
pursuing
those
which
had
got
loose
and
soldiers
climbing
over
fences
for
protection
against
the
supposed
advancing
yankees
in
the
middle
of
the
din
i
heard
an
artillery
officer
shouting
to
his
cannoneers
to
stand
by
him
and
plant
the
guns
in
a
proper
position
for
enfilading
the
lane
i
also
distinguished
longstreet
walking
about
hustled
by
the
excited
crowd
and
remarking
in
angry
tones
which
could
scarcely
be
heard
and
to
which
no
attention
was
paid
now
you
do
know
what
it
is
you
do
know
what
it
is
whilst
the
row
and
confusion
were
at
their
height
the
object
of
all
this
alarm
at
length
emerged
from
the
dark
lane
in
the
shape
of
a
domestic
carriage
with
a
harmless
load
of
females
the
stampede
had
however
spread
increased
in
the
rear
and
caused
much
harm
and
delay
cavalry
skirmishing
went
on
until
quite
dark
a
determined
attack
having
been
made
by
the
enemy
who
did
his
best
to
prevent
the
trains
from
crossing
the
potomac
at
williamsport
it
resulted
in
the
success
of
the
confederates
but
every
impartial
man
confesses
that
these
cavalry
fights
are
miserable
affairs
neither
party
has
any
idea
of
serious
charging
with
the
sabre
they
approach
one
another
with
considerable
boldness
until
they
get
to
within
about
forty
yards
and
then
at
the
very
moment
when
a
dash
is
necessary
and
the
sword
alone
should
be
used
they
hesitate
halt
and
commence
a
desultory
fire
with
carbines
and
revolvers
an
englishman
named
winthrop
a
captain
in
the
confederate
army
and
formerly
an
officer
in
regiment
although
not
in
the
cavalry
himself
seized
the
colours
of
one
of
the
regiments
and
rode
straight
at
the
yankees
in
the
most
gallant
manner
shouting
to
the
men
to
follow
him
he
continued
to
distinguish
himself
by
leading
charges
until
his
horse
was
unfortunately
killed
i
heard
his
conduct
on
this
occasion
highly
spoken
of
by
all
stuart
cavalry
can
hardly
be
called
cavalry
in
the
european
sense
of
the
word
but
on
the
other
hand
the
country
in
which
they
are
accustomed
to
operate
is
not
adapted
for
cavalry
was
forced
at
last
to
give
up
wearing
even
his
austrian
for
the
last
two
days
soldiers
on
the
line
of
march
had
been
visiting
his
ambulance
in
great
numbers
under
the
impression
encouraged
by
the
driver
that
he
was
a
yankee
general
the
idea
now
was
that
the
army
would
remain
some
days
in
or
near
its
present
position
until
the
arrival
of
the
ammunition
from
winchester
from
what
i
have
seen
of
the
southern
negroes
i
am
of
opinion
that
the
confederates
could
if
they
chose
convert
a
great
number
into
soldiers
and
from
the
affection
which
undoubtedly
exists
as
a
general
rule
between
the
slaves
and
their
masters
i
think
that
they
would
prove
more
efficient
than
black
troops
under
any
other
circumstances
but
i
do
not
imagine
that
such
an
experiment
will
be
tried
except
as
a
very
last
resort
partly
on
account
of
the
great
value
of
the
negroes
and
partly
because
the
southerners
consider
it
improper
to
introduce
such
an
element
on
a
large
scale
into
civilised
warfare
any
person
who
has
seen
negro
features
convulsed
with
rage
may
form
a
slight
estimate
of
what
the
result
would
be
of
arming
a
vast
number
of
blacks
rousing
their
passions
and
then
allowing
them
free
scope
tuesday
lawley
the
austrian
and
i
drove
into
hagerstown
this
morning
and
general
longstreet
moved
into
a
new
position
on
the
williamsport
road
which
he
was
to
occupy
for
the
present
we
got
an
excellent
room
in
the
washington
hotel
on
producing
greenbacks
public
opinion
in
hagerstown
seems
to
be
pretty
evenly
divided
between
north
and
south
and
probably
accommodates
itself
to
circumstances
for
instance
yesterday
the
women
waved
their
handkerchiefs
when
the
yankee
cavalry
were
driven
through
the
town
and
they
went
through
the
same
compliment
in
honour
of
yankee
gettysburg
prisoners
whom
i
saw
marched
through
for
richmond
i
overheard
the
conversation
of
some
confederate
soldiers
about
these
prisoners
one
remarked
with
respect
to
the
zouaves
of
whom
there
were
a
few
those
fellows
look
as
if
they
could
fight
but
they
do
though
no
not
so
well
as
the
bluebellies
lawley
introduced
me
to
general
stuart
in
the
streets
of
hagerstown
he
is
commonly
called
jeb
stuart
on
account
of
his
initials
he
is
a
jovial
character
exactly
like
his
photographs
he
has
certainly
accomplished
wonders
and
done
excellent
service
in
his
peculiar
style
of
warfare
he
is
a
good
and
gallant
soldier
though
he
sometimes
incurs
ridicule
by
his
harmless
affectation
and
peculiarities
the
other
day
he
rode
through
a
virginian
town
his
horse
covered
with
garlands
of
roses
he
also
departs
considerably
from
the
severe
simplicity
of
dress
adopted
by
other
confederate
generals
but
no
one
can
deny
that
he
is
the
right
man
in
the
right
place
on
a
campaign
he
seems
to
roam
over
the
country
according
to
his
own
discretion
and
always
gives
a
good
account
of
himself
turning
up
at
the
right
moment
and
hitherto
he
has
never
got
himself
into
any
serious
trouble
i
rode
to
general
longstreet
camp
which
is
about
two
miles
in
the
direction
of
williamsport
and
consulted
him
about
my
difficulties
with
regard
to
my
leave
he
was
most
about
it
and
advised
me
under
the
circumstances
to
drive
in
the
direction
of
hancock
and
in
the
event
of
being
on
my
way
to
insist
upon
being
taken
before
the
nearest
officer
of
the
highest
rank
who
would
probably
protect
me
i
determined
to
take
his
advice
at
once
so
i
took
leave
of
him
and
of
his
officers
longstreet
is
generally
a
very
taciturn
and
undemonstrative
man
but
he
was
quite
affectionate
in
his
farewell
his
last
words
were
a
hearty
hope
for
the
speedy
termination
of
the
war
all
his
officers
were
equally
kind
in
their
expressions
on
my
taking
leave
though
the
last
sentence
uttered
by
latrobe
was
not
entirely
reassuring
you
may
take
your
oath
he
be
caught
for
a
spy
i
then
rode
to
general
lee
camp
and
asked
him
for
a
pass
to
get
through
his
lines
we
had
a
long
talk
together
and
he
told
me
of
the
raid
made
by
the
enemy
for
the
express
purpose
of
arresting
his
badly
wounded
son
a
confederate
who
was
lying
in
the
house
of
a
relation
in
virginia
they
insisted
upon
carrying
him
off
in
a
litter
though
he
had
never
been
out
of
bed
and
had
quite
recently
been
shot
through
the
thigh
this
seizure
was
evidently
made
for
purposes
of
retaliation
his
life
has
since
been
threatened
in
the
event
of
the
south
retaliating
for
burnside
alleged
military
murders
in
kentucky
but
few
officers
however
speak
of
the
northerners
with
so
much
moderation
as
general
lee
his
extreme
amiability
seems
to
prevent
his
speaking
strongly
against
any
one
i
really
felt
quite
sorry
when
i
said
to
so
many
gentlemen
from
whom
i
had
received
so
much
disinterested
kindness
i
am
now
about
to
leave
the
southern
states
after
travelling
quite
alone
throughout
their
entire
length
and
breadth
including
texas
and
the
country
for
nearly
three
months
and
a
half
during
which
time
i
have
been
thrown
amongst
all
classes
of
the
population
the
highest
the
lowest
and
the
most
lawless
although
many
were
very
sore
about
the
conduct
of
england
i
never
received
an
uncivil
word
from
anybody
but
on
the
contrary
i
have
been
treated
by
all
with
more
than
kindness
i
have
never
met
a
man
who
was
not
anxious
for
a
termination
of
the
war
and
i
have
never
met
a
man
woman
or
child
who
contemplated
its
termination
as
possible
without
an
entire
separation
from
the
detested
yankee
i
have
never
been
asked
for
alms
or
a
gratuity
by
any
man
or
woman
black
or
white
every
one
knew
who
i
was
and
all
spoke
to
me
with
the
greatest
confidence
i
have
rarely
heard
any
person
complain
of
the
almost
total
ruin
which
has
befallen
so
many
all
are
prepared
to
undergo
still
greater
sacrifices
they
contemplate
and
prepare
to
receive
great
reverses
which
it
is
impossible
to
avert
they
look
to
a
successful
termination
of
the
war
as
certain
although
few
are
sanguine
enough
to
fix
a
speedy
date
for
it
and
nearly
all
bargain
for
its
lasting
at
least
all
lincoln
presidency
although
i
have
always
been
with
the
confederates
in
the
time
of
their
misfortunes
yet
i
never
heard
any
person
use
a
desponding
word
as
to
the
result
of
the
struggle
when
i
was
in
texas
and
louisiana
banks
seemed
to
be
carrying
everything
before
him
grant
was
doing
the
same
in
mississippi
and
i
certainly
did
not
bring
luck
to
my
friends
at
gettysburg
i
have
lived
in
bivouacs
with
all
the
southern
armies
which
are
as
distinct
from
one
another
as
the
british
is
from
the
austrian
and
i
have
never
once
seen
an
instance
of
insubordination
when
i
got
back
to
hagerstown
i
endeavoured
to
make
arrangements
for
a
horse
and
buggy
to
drive
through
the
lines
with
immense
difficulty
i
secured
the
services
of
a
mr
to
take
me
to
hancock
and
as
much
farther
as
i
chose
to
go
for
a
dollar
a
mile
greenbacks
i
engaged
also
to
pay
him
the
value
of
his
horse
and
buggy
in
case
they
should
be
confiscated
by
either
side
he
was
evidently
extremely
alarmed
and
i
was
obliged
to
keep
him
up
to
the
mark
by
assurances
that
his
horse
would
inevitably
be
seized
by
the
confederates
unless
protected
by
general
lee
pass
in
my
possession
the
only
occasion
on
which
i
was
roughly
handled
was
when
i
had
the
misfortune
to
enter
the
city
of
jackson
mississippi
just
as
the
federals
evacuated
it
i
do
not
complain
of
that
affair
which
under
the
circumstances
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
wednesday
my
conductor
told
me
he
could
go
on
account
of
a
funeral
but
he
promised
faithfully
to
start
every
one
was
full
of
forebodings
as
to
my
probable
fate
when
i
fell
into
yankee
clutches
in
deference
to
their
advice
i
took
off
my
grey
in
which
they
said
i
was
sure
to
be
taken
for
a
rebel
and
i
put
on
a
black
coat
but
i
scouted
all
advice
as
to
endeavouring
to
disguise
myself
as
an
american
citizen
or
to
conceal
the
exact
truth
in
any
way
i
was
aware
that
a
great
deal
depended
upon
falling
into
the
hands
of
a
gentleman
and
i
did
not
believe
these
were
so
rare
in
the
northern
army
as
the
confederates
led
me
to
suppose
thursday
i
left
hagerstown
at
in
my
good
buggy
after
saying
farewell
to
lawley
the
austrian
and
the
numerous
confederate
officers
who
came
to
see
me
off
and
wish
me
we
passed
the
confederate
advanced
post
at
about
two
miles
from
hagerstown
and
were
allowed
to
pass
on
the
production
of
general
lee
authority
i
was
now
fairly
launched
beyond
the
confederate
lines
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
been
in
america
immediately
afterwards
we
began
to
be
asked
all
sorts
of
inquisitive
questions
about
the
rebels
which
i
left
to
my
driver
to
answer
it
became
perfectly
evident
that
this
narrow
strip
of
maryland
is
entirely
unionist
at
about
we
reached
the
top
of
a
high
hill
and
halted
to
bait
our
horse
at
an
inn
called
fairview
no
sooner
had
we
descended
from
the
buggy
than
about
twenty
rampageous
unionists
appeared
who
told
us
they
had
come
up
to
get
a
good
view
of
the
big
fight
in
which
the
g
d
d
d
rebels
were
to
be
all
captured
or
drowned
in
the
potomac
my
appearance
evidently
did
not
please
them
from
the
very
first
with
alarm
i
observed
them
talking
to
one
another
and
pointing
at
me
at
length
a
particularly
individual
with
an
enormous
mustache
approached
me
and
fixing
his
eyes
long
and
steadfastly
upon
my
trousers
he
remarked
in
the
surliest
possible
tones
breeches
is
a
d
d
bad
this
he
said
in
allusion
not
to
their
dirty
state
but
to
the
fact
of
their
being
grey
the
rebel
colour
i
replied
to
this
very
disagreeable
assertion
in
as
conciliating
a
way
as
i
possibly
could
and
in
answer
to
his
question
as
to
who
i
was
i
said
that
i
was
an
english
traveller
he
then
said
that
his
wife
was
an
english
lady
from
preston
i
next
expressed
my
pride
in
being
a
countryman
of
his
wife
he
then
told
me
in
tones
that
admitted
of
no
contradiction
that
preston
was
just
miles
east
of
london
and
he
afterwards
launched
into
torrents
of
invectives
against
the
rebels
who
had
out
of
virginia
and
he
stated
his
intention
of
killing
them
in
great
numbers
to
gratify
his
taste
with
some
difficulty
i
prevailed
upon
him
and
his
rabid
brethren
to
drink
which
pacified
them
slightly
for
a
time
but
when
the
horse
was
brought
out
to
be
harnessed
it
became
evident
i
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
proceed
without
a
row
i
therefore
addressed
the
crowd
and
asked
them
quietly
who
among
them
wished
to
detain
me
and
i
told
them
at
the
same
time
that
i
would
not
answer
any
questions
put
by
those
who
were
not
persons
in
authority
but
that
i
should
be
most
happy
to
explain
myself
to
any
officer
of
the
united
states
army
at
length
they
allowed
me
to
proceed
on
the
understanding
that
my
should
hand
me
over
to
general
kelly
at
hancock
the
driver
was
provided
with
a
letter
for
the
general
in
which
i
afterwards
discovered
that
i
was
denounced
as
a
spy
and
handed
over
to
the
general
be
dealt
with
as
justice
to
our
cause
we
were
then
allowed
to
start
the
driver
being
threatened
with
condign
vengeance
if
he
let
me
escape
after
we
had
proceeded
about
six
miles
we
fell
in
with
some
yankee
cavalry
by
whom
we
were
immediately
captured
and
the
responsibility
of
my
custody
was
thus
removed
from
my
conductor
shoulders
a
cavalry
soldier
was
put
in
charge
of
us
and
we
passed
through
the
numerous
yankee
outposts
under
the
title
of
the
hills
near
hancock
were
white
with
yankee
tents
and
there
were
i
believe
from
to
federals
there
i
did
not
think
much
of
the
appearance
of
the
northern
troops
they
are
certainly
dressed
in
proper
uniform
but
their
clothes
are
badly
fitted
and
they
are
often
dirty
and
slovenly
in
appearance
in
fact
bad
imitations
of
soldiers
now
the
confederate
has
no
ambition
to
imitate
the
regular
soldier
at
all
he
looks
the
genuine
rebel
but
in
spite
of
his
bare
feet
his
ragged
clothes
his
old
rug
and
stuck
like
a
rose
in
his
he
has
a
sort
of
reckless
look
which
is
decidedly
taking
at
we
drove
up
in
front
of
the
door
of
general
kelly
quarters
and
to
my
immense
relief
i
soon
discovered
that
he
was
a
gentleman
i
then
explained
to
him
the
whole
truth
concealing
nothing
i
said
i
was
a
british
officer
on
leave
of
absence
travelling
for
my
own
instruction
that
i
had
been
all
the
way
to
mexico
and
entered
the
southern
states
by
the
rio
grande
for
the
express
purpose
of
not
breaking
any
legally
established
blockade
i
told
him
i
had
visited
all
the
southern
armies
in
mississippi
tennessee
charleston
and
virginia
and
seen
the
late
campaign
as
general
longstreet
guest
but
had
in
no
way
entered
the
confederate
service
i
also
gave
him
my
word
that
i
had
not
got
in
my
possession
any
letters
either
public
or
private
from
any
person
in
the
south
to
any
person
anywhere
else
i
showed
him
my
british
passport
and
general
lee
pass
as
a
british
officer
and
i
explained
that
my
only
object
in
coming
north
was
to
return
to
england
in
time
for
the
expiration
of
my
leave
and
i
ended
by
expressing
a
hope
that
he
would
make
my
detention
as
short
as
possible
after
considering
a
short
time
he
said
that
he
would
certainly
allow
me
to
go
on
but
that
he
could
not
allow
my
driver
to
go
back
i
felt
immensely
relieved
at
the
decision
but
the
countenance
of
my
companion
lengthened
considerably
it
was
however
settled
that
he
should
take
me
on
to
cumberland
and
general
kelly
promised
to
do
what
he
could
for
him
on
his
return
general
kelly
then
asked
me
in
an
manner
whether
all
general
lee
army
was
at
hagerstown
but
i
replied
laughing
you
of
course
understand
general
that
having
got
that
pass
from
general
lee
i
am
bound
by
every
principle
of
honour
not
to
give
you
any
information
which
can
be
of
advantage
to
you
he
laughed
and
promised
not
to
ask
me
any
more
questions
of
that
sort
he
then
sent
his
with
me
to
the
who
immediately
gave
me
a
pass
for
cumberland
on
my
return
to
the
general
i
discovered
the
perfidious
driver
that
zealous
southerner
a
few
hours
previous
hard
at
work
communicating
to
general
kelly
all
he
knew
and
a
great
deal
more
besides
but
from
what
i
heard
i
do
think
his
information
was
very
valuable
i
was
treated
by
general
kelly
and
all
his
officers
with
the
greatest
and
courtesy
although
i
had
certainly
come
among
them
under
circumstances
suspicious
to
say
the
least
i
felt
quite
sorry
that
they
should
be
opposed
to
my
southern
friends
and
i
regretted
still
more
that
they
should
be
obliged
to
serve
with
or
under
a
butler
a
milroy
or
even
a
hooker
i
took
leave
of
them
at
six
and
i
can
truly
say
that
the
only
federal
officers
i
have
ever
come
in
contact
with
were
gentlemen
we
had
got
four
miles
beyond
hancock
when
the
tire
of
one
of
our
wheels
came
off
and
we
had
to
stop
for
a
night
at
a
farmhouse
i
had
supper
with
the
farmer
and
his
labourers
who
had
just
come
in
from
the
fields
and
the
supper
was
much
superior
to
that
which
can
be
procured
at
the
first
hotel
at
richmond
all
were
violent
unionists
and
perfectly
under
the
impression
that
the
rebels
were
totally
demoralised
and
about
to
lay
down
their
arms
of
course
i
held
my
tongue
and
gave
no
one
reason
to
suppose
that
i
had
ever
been
in
rebeldom
this
in
the
is
a
very
common
custom
and
has
a
most
quaint
effect
friday
the
drive
from
hancock
to
cumberland
is
a
very
mountainous
miles
total
distance
from
hagerstown
miles
we
met
with
no
further
adventure
on
the
road
although
the
people
were
very
inquisitive
but
i
never
opened
my
mouth
one
woman
in
particular
who
kept
a
thrust
her
ugly
old
head
out
of
an
upper
window
and
yelled
out
air
they
for
another
battle
out
there
jerking
her
head
in
the
direction
of
hagerstown
the
driver
replied
that
although
the
bunch
of
rebels
there
was
pretty
big
yet
he
could
not
answer
for
their
fixing
arrangements
which
he
afterwards
explained
to
me
meant
digging
fortifications
we
arrived
at
cumberland
at
this
is
a
great
coal
place
and
a
few
weeks
ago
it
was
touched
up
by
imboden
who
burnt
a
lot
of
coal
barges
which
has
rendered
the
people
rabid
against
the
rebs
i
started
by
stage
for
johnstown
at
saturday
i
hope
i
may
never
for
my
sins
be
again
condemned
to
travel
for
thirty
hours
in
an
american
stage
on
a
plank
road
we
changed
carriages
at
somerset
all
my
were
of
course
violent
unionists
and
invariably
spoke
of
my
late
friends
as
rebels
or
rebs
they
had
all
got
it
into
their
heads
that
their
potomac
army
not
having
been
thoroughly
thrashed
as
it
always
has
been
hitherto
had
achieved
a
tremendous
victory
and
that
its
new
chief
general
meade
who
in
reality
was
driven
into
a
strong
position
which
he
had
sense
enough
to
stick
to
is
a
wonderful
strategist
they
all
hope
that
the
remnants
of
lee
army
will
not
be
allowed
to
escape
over
the
potomac
whereas
when
i
left
the
army
two
days
ago
no
man
in
it
had
a
thought
of
escaping
over
the
potomac
and
certainly
general
meade
was
not
in
a
position
to
attempt
to
prevent
the
passage
if
crossing
had
become
necessary
i
reached
johnstown
on
the
pennsylvania
railway
at
and
found
that
town
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
in
consequence
of
the
review
of
two
militia
companies
who
were
receiving
garlands
from
the
fair
ladies
of
johnstown
in
gratitude
for
their
daring
conduct
in
turning
out
to
resist
lee
invasion
most
of
the
men
seemed
to
be
respectable
mechanics
not
at
all
adapted
for
an
early
interview
with
the
rebels
the
garlands
supplied
were
as
big
and
apparently
as
substantial
as
a
ship
and
the
recipients
looked
particularly
helpless
after
they
had
got
them
heaven
help
those
pennsylvanian
braves
if
a
score
of
hood
texans
had
caught
sight
of
them
left
johnstown
by
train
at
and
by
paying
half
a
dollar
i
secured
a
berth
in
a
a
most
admirable
and
ingenious
yankee
notion
sunday
the
pittsburg
and
philadelphia
railway
is
i
believe
accounted
one
of
the
best
in
america
which
did
not
prevent
my
spending
eight
hours
last
night
off
the
line
but
being
asleep
at
the
time
i
was
unaware
of
the
circumstance
instead
of
arriving
at
philadelphia
at
we
did
not
get
there
till
passed
harrisburg
at
it
was
full
of
yankee
soldiers
and
has
evidently
not
recovered
from
the
excitement
consequent
upon
the
late
invasion
one
effect
of
which
has
been
to
prevent
the
cutting
of
the
crops
by
the
calling
out
of
the
militia
at
philadelphia
i
saw
a
train
containing
one
hundred
and
fifty
confederate
prisoners
who
were
being
stared
at
by
a
large
number
of
the
of
philadelphia
i
mingled
with
the
crowd
which
was
chaffing
them
most
of
the
people
were
but
i
heard
one
suggestion
to
the
effect
that
they
should
be
taken
to
the
river
and
every
mother
son
of
them
drowned
there
i
arrived
at
new
york
at
and
drove
to
the
fifth
avenue
hotel
monday
the
luxury
and
comfort
of
new
york
and
philadelphia
strike
one
as
extraordinary
after
having
lately
come
from
charleston
and
richmond
the
greenbacks
seem
to
be
nearly
as
good
as
gold
the
streets
are
as
full
as
possible
of
people
and
are
crowded
with
civilians
capable
of
bearing
arms
who
have
evidently
no
intention
of
doing
so
they
apparently
feel
the
war
at
here
and
until
there
is
a
grand
smash
with
their
money
or
some
other
catastrophe
to
make
them
feel
it
i
can
easily
imagine
that
they
will
not
be
anxious
to
make
peace
i
walked
the
whole
distance
of
broadway
to
the
consul
house
and
nothing
could
exceed
the
apparent
prosperity
the
street
was
covered
with
banners
and
placards
inviting
people
to
enlist
in
various
regiments
bounties
of
were
offered
and
huge
pictures
hung
across
the
street
on
which
numbers
of
ragged
terror
depicted
on
their
features
were
being
pursued
by
the
federals
on
returning
to
the
fifth
avenue
i
found
all
the
shopkeepers
beginning
to
close
their
stores
and
i
perceived
by
degrees
that
there
was
great
alarm
about
the
resistance
to
the
draft
which
was
going
on
this
morning
on
reaching
the
hotel
i
perceived
a
whole
block
of
buildings
on
fire
close
by
engines
were
present
but
were
not
allowed
to
play
by
the
crowd
in
the
hotel
itself
universal
consternation
prevailed
and
an
attack
by
the
mob
had
been
threatened
i
walked
about
in
the
neighbourhood
and
saw
a
company
of
soldiers
on
the
march
who
were
being
jeered
at
and
hooted
by
small
boys
and
i
saw
a
negro
pursued
by
the
crowd
take
refuge
with
the
military
he
was
followed
by
loud
cries
of
down
with
the
b
y
nigger
kill
all
niggers
never
having
been
in
new
york
before
and
being
totally
ignorant
of
the
state
of
feeling
with
regard
to
negroes
i
inquired
of
a
bystander
what
the
negroes
had
done
that
they
should
want
to
kill
them
he
replied
civilly
enough
oh
sir
they
hate
them
here
they
are
the
innocent
cause
of
all
these
troubles
shortly
afterwards
i
saw
a
troop
of
citizen
cavalry
come
up
the
troopers
were
very
gorgeously
attired
but
evidently
experienced
so
much
difficulty
in
sitting
their
horses
that
they
were
more
likely
to
excite
laughter
than
any
other
emotion
the
northerners
call
the
southerners
greybacks
just
as
the
latter
call
the
former
bluebellies
on
account
of
the
colour
of
their
dress
tuesday
at
breakfast
this
morning
two
irish
waiters
seeing
i
was
a
britisher
came
up
to
me
one
after
the
other
and
whispered
at
intervals
in
hoarse
hibernian
accents
it
disgraceful
sir
i
been
drafted
sir
i
a
briton
i
love
my
country
i
love
the
union
jack
sir
i
suggested
an
interview
with
mr
archibald
but
neither
of
them
seemed
to
care
about
going
to
the
just
yet
these
rascals
have
probably
been
hard
at
work
for
years
voting
as
free
and
enlightened
american
citizens
and
abusing
england
to
their
content
i
heard
every
one
talking
of
the
total
demoralisation
of
the
rebels
as
a
certain
fact
and
all
seemed
to
anticipate
their
approaching
destruction
all
this
sounded
very
absurd
to
me
who
had
left
lee
army
four
days
previously
as
full
of
fight
as
ever
much
stronger
in
numbers
and
ten
times
more
efficient
in
every
military
point
of
view
than
it
was
it
crossed
the
potomac
to
invade
maryland
a
year
in
its
own
opinion
lee
army
has
not
lost
any
of
its
prestige
at
the
battle
of
gettysburg
in
which
it
most
gallantly
stormed
strong
intrenchments
defended
by
the
whole
army
of
the
potomac
which
never
ventured
outside
its
works
or
approached
in
force
within
half
a
mile
of
the
confederate
artillery
the
result
of
the
battle
of
gettysburg
together
with
the
fall
of
vicksburg
and
port
hudson
seems
to
have
turned
everybody
head
completely
and
has
deluded
them
with
the
idea
of
the
speedy
and
complete
subjugation
of
the
south
i
was
filled
with
astonishment
to
hear
people
speaking
in
this
confident
manner
when
one
of
their
most
prosperous
states
had
been
so
recently
laid
under
contribution
as
far
as
harrisburg
and
washington
their
capital
itself
having
just
been
saved
by
a
fortunate
turn
of
luck
of
the
pennsylvanian
spoil
had
safely
crossed
the
potomac
before
i
left
hagerstown
the
consternation
in
the
streets
seemed
to
be
on
the
increase
fires
were
going
on
in
all
directions
and
the
streets
were
being
patrolled
by
large
bodies
of
police
followed
by
special
constables
the
latter
bearing
truncheons
but
not
looking
very
happy
i
heard
a
british
captain
making
a
deposition
before
the
consul
to
the
effect
that
the
mob
had
got
on
board
his
vessel
and
cruelly
beaten
his
coloured
crew
as
no
british
was
present
the
french
admiral
was
appealed
to
who
at
once
requested
that
all
british
ships
with
coloured
crews
might
be
anchored
under
the
guns
of
his
frigate
the
reports
of
outrages
hangings
and
murder
were
now
most
alarming
and
terror
and
anxiety
were
universal
all
shops
were
shut
all
carriages
and
omnibuses
had
ceased
running
no
coloured
man
or
woman
was
visible
or
safe
in
the
streets
or
even
in
his
own
dwelling
telegraphs
were
cut
and
railroad
tracks
torn
up
the
draft
was
suspended
and
the
mob
evidently
had
the
upper
hand
the
people
who
ca
pay
naturally
hate
being
forced
to
fight
in
order
to
liberate
the
very
race
who
they
are
most
anxious
should
be
slaves
it
is
their
direct
interest
not
only
that
all
slaves
should
remain
slaves
but
that
the
free
northern
negroes
who
compete
with
them
for
labour
should
be
sent
to
the
south
also
wednesday
the
hotel
this
morning
was
occupied
by
military
or
rather
by
creatures
in
uniform
one
of
the
sentries
stopped
me
and
on
my
remonstrating
to
his
officer
the
latter
blew
up
the
sentry
and
said
you
are
only
to
stop
persons
in
military
dress
you
know
what
military
dress
is
no
responded
this
efficient
sentry
and
i
left
the
pair
discussing
the
definition
of
a
soldier
i
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
getting
a
conveyance
down
to
the
water
i
saw
a
stone
barricade
in
the
distance
and
heard
firing
going
on
and
was
not
at
all
sorry
to
find
myself
on
board
the
china
during
my
voyage
home
in
the
china
i
had
an
opportunity
of
discussing
with
many
intelligent
northern
gentlemen
all
that
i
had
seen
in
my
southern
travels
we
did
so
in
a
very
amicable
spirit
and
i
think
they
rendered
justice
to
my
wish
to
explain
to
them
without
exaggeration
the
state
of
feeling
amongst
their
enemies
although
these
northerners
belonged
to
quite
the
upper
classes
and
were
not
likely
to
be
led
blindly
by
the
absurd
nonsense
of
the
sensation
press
at
new
york
yet
their
ignorance
of
the
state
of
the
case
in
the
south
was
very
great
the
recent
successes
had
given
them
the
impression
that
the
last
card
of
the
south
was
played
charleston
was
about
to
fall
mobile
savannah
and
wilmington
would
quickly
follow
lee
army
they
thought
was
a
disheartened
disorganised
mob
bragg
army
in
a
still
worse
condition
fleeing
before
rosecrans
who
would
carry
everything
before
him
they
felt
confident
that
the
fall
of
the
mississippian
fortresses
would
prevent
communication
from
one
bank
to
the
other
and
that
the
great
river
would
soon
be
open
to
peaceful
commerce
all
these
illusions
have
since
been
dispelled
but
they
probably
still
cling
to
the
idea
of
the
great
exhaustion
of
the
southern
but
this
difficulty
of
recruiting
the
southern
armies
is
not
so
great
as
is
generally
supposed
as
i
have
already
stated
no
confederate
soldier
is
given
his
discharge
from
the
army
however
badly
he
may
be
wounded
but
he
is
employed
at
such
labour
in
the
public
service
as
he
may
be
capable
of
performing
and
his
place
in
the
ranks
is
taken
by
a
sound
man
hitherto
exempted
the
slightly
wounded
are
cured
as
quickly
as
possible
and
are
sent
back
at
once
to
their
regiments
women
take
care
of
the
number
actually
killed
or
who
die
of
their
wounds
are
the
only
total
losses
to
the
state
and
these
form
but
a
small
proportion
of
the
enormous
butcher
bills
which
seem
at
first
so
very
appalling
i
myself
remember
with
general
polk
corps
a
man
who
had
had
both
his
hands
blown
off
at
the
wrists
by
unskilful
in
one
of
the
early
battles
a
currycomb
and
brush
were
fitted
into
his
stumps
and
he
was
engaged
in
grooming
with
considerable
skill
this
man
was
called
an
hostler
and
as
the
war
drags
on
the
number
of
these
handless
hostlers
will
increase
by
degrees
the
clerks
at
the
offices
the
orderlies
the
railway
and
officials
and
the
will
be
composed
of
maimed
and
mutilated
soldiers
the
number
of
exempted
persons
all
over
the
south
is
still
very
large
and
they
can
easily
be
exchanged
for
worn
veterans
besides
this
fund
to
draw
upon
a
calculation
is
made
of
the
number
of
boys
who
arrive
each
year
at
the
fighting
age
these
are
all
panting
for
the
rifle
but
have
been
latterly
wisely
forbidden
the
ranks
until
they
are
fit
to
undergo
the
hardships
of
a
military
life
by
these
means
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
confederates
that
they
can
keep
their
armies
recruited
up
to
their
present
strength
for
several
years
and
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
they
can
always
fall
back
upon
their
negroes
as
a
last
resort
but
i
do
not
think
they
contemplate
such
a
necessity
as
likely
to
arise
for
a
considerable
time
with
respect
to
the
supply
of
arms
cannon
powder
and
military
stores
the
confederates
are
under
no
alarm
whatever
augusta
furnishes
more
than
sufficient
gunpowder
atlanta
copper
caps
the
tredegar
works
at
richmond
and
other
foundries
cast
more
cannon
than
is
wanted
and
the
federal
generals
have
always
hitherto
proved
themselves
the
most
indefatigable
purveyors
of
artillery
to
the
confederate
government
for
even
in
those
actions
which
they
claim
as
drawn
battles
or
as
victories
such
as
corinth
murfreesborough
and
gettysburg
they
have
never
failed
to
make
over
cannon
to
the
southerners
without
exacting
any
in
return
my
northern
friends
on
board
the
china
spoke
much
and
earnestly
about
the
determination
of
the
north
to
crush
out
the
rebellion
at
any
sacrifice
but
they
did
not
show
any
disposition
to
in
this
cause
although
many
of
them
would
have
made
most
eligible
recruits
and
if
they
had
been
southerners
their
female
relations
would
have
made
them
enter
the
army
whether
their
inclinations
led
them
that
way
or
not
i
do
not
mention
this
difference
of
spirit
by
way
of
making
any
odious
comparisons
between
north
and
south
in
this
respect
because
i
feel
sure
that
these
northern
gentlemen
would
emulate
the
example
of
their
enemy
if
they
could
foresee
any
danger
of
a
southern
butler
exercising
his
infamous
sway
over
philadelphia
or
of
a
confederate
milroy
ruling
with
intolerable
despotism
in
boston
by
withholding
the
necessaries
of
life
from
helpless
women
with
one
hand
whilst
tendering
them
with
the
other
a
hated
and
absurd
oath
of
allegiance
to
a
detested
government
but
the
mass
of
respectable
northerners
though
they
may
be
willing
to
pay
do
not
very
naturally
feel
themselves
called
upon
to
give
their
blood
in
a
war
of
aggression
ambition
and
conquest
for
this
war
is
essentially
a
war
of
conquest
if
ever
a
nation
did
wage
such
a
war
the
north
is
now
engaged
with
a
determination
worthy
of
a
more
hopeful
cause
in
endeavouring
to
conquer
the
south
but
the
more
i
think
of
all
that
i
have
seen
in
the
confederate
states
of
the
devotion
of
the
whole
population
the
more
i
feel
inclined
to
say
with
general
polk
how
can
you
subjugate
such
a
people
as
this
and
even
supposing
that
their
extermination
were
a
feasible
plan
as
some
northerners
have
suggested
i
never
can
believe
that
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
civilised
world
will
be
condemned
to
witness
the
destruction
of
such
a
gallant
