fiesco
or
the
genoese
conspiracy
a
tragedy
by
frederich
schiller
author
preface
the
chief
sources
from
which
i
have
drawn
the
history
of
this
conspiracy
are
cardinal
de
retz
conjuration
du
comte
jean
louis
de
fiesque
the
histoire
des
genes
and
the
third
volume
of
robertson
history
of
charles
the
fifth
the
liberties
which
i
have
taken
with
the
historical
facts
will
be
excused
if
i
have
succeeded
in
my
attempt
and
if
not
it
is
better
that
my
failure
should
appear
in
the
effusions
of
fancy
than
in
the
delineation
of
truth
some
deviation
from
the
real
catastrophe
of
the
conspiracy
according
to
which
the
count
actually
perished
a
when
his
schemes
were
nearly
ripe
for
execution
was
rendered
necessary
by
the
nature
of
the
drama
which
does
not
allow
the
interposition
either
of
chance
or
of
a
particular
providence
it
would
be
matter
of
surprise
to
me
that
this
subject
has
never
been
adopted
by
any
tragic
writer
did
not
the
circumstances
of
its
conclusion
so
unfit
for
dramatic
representation
afford
a
sufficient
reason
for
such
neglect
beings
of
a
superior
nature
may
discriminate
the
finest
links
of
that
chain
which
connects
an
individual
action
with
the
system
of
the
universe
and
may
perhaps
behold
them
extended
to
the
utmost
limits
of
time
past
and
future
but
man
seldom
sees
more
than
the
simple
facts
divested
of
their
various
relations
of
cause
and
effect
the
writer
therefore
must
adapt
his
performance
to
the
of
human
nature
which
he
would
enlighten
and
not
to
the
penetration
of
omniscience
from
which
all
intelligence
is
derived
in
my
tragedy
of
the
robbers
it
was
my
object
to
delineate
the
victim
of
an
extravagant
sensibility
here
i
endeavor
to
paint
the
reverse
a
victim
of
art
and
intrigue
but
however
strongly
marked
in
the
page
of
history
the
unfortunate
project
of
fiesco
may
appear
on
the
stage
it
may
prove
less
interesting
if
it
be
true
that
sensibility
alone
awakens
sensibility
we
may
conclude
that
the
political
hero
is
the
less
calculated
for
dramatic
representation
in
proportion
as
it
becomes
necessary
to
lay
aside
the
feelings
of
a
man
in
order
to
become
a
political
hero
it
was
therefore
impossible
for
me
to
breathe
into
my
fable
that
glowing
life
which
animates
the
pure
productions
of
poetical
inspiration
but
in
order
to
render
the
cold
and
sterile
actions
of
the
politician
capable
of
affecting
the
human
heart
i
was
obliged
to
seek
a
clue
to
those
actions
in
the
human
heart
itself
i
was
obliged
to
blend
together
the
man
and
the
politician
and
to
draw
from
the
refined
intrigues
of
state
situations
interesting
to
humanity
the
relations
which
i
bear
to
society
are
such
as
unfold
to
me
more
of
the
heart
than
of
the
cabinet
and
perhaps
this
very
political
defect
may
have
become
a
poetical
excellence
a
fiesco
after
having
succeeded
in
the
chief
objects
of
his
undertaking
happened
to
fall
into
the
sea
whilst
hastening
to
quell
some
disturbances
on
board
of
a
vessel
in
the
harbor
the
weight
of
his
armor
rendered
his
struggles
ineffectual
and
he
perished
the
deviation
from
history
in
the
tragedy
might
have
been
carried
farther
and
would
perhaps
have
rendered
it
more
suitable
to
dramatic
translation

was
it
not
so

most
certainly
there
can
be
no

of
it
leonora
in

does
she
then

mistress

these
thoughts
lead

this

world
to
him

as
one
precious
diamond

a
pause
music
is
again
heard
leonora
starting
hark
was
not
that
fiesco
voice
which
from
the
tumult
penetrated
even
hither
can
he
laugh
while
his
leonora
weeps
in
solitude
oh
no
my
child
it
was
the
coarse
loud
voice
of
gianettino
arabella
it
was
signora
but
let
us
retire
to
another
apartment
leonora
you
change
color
arabella
you
are
false
in
your
looks
in
the
looks
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
genoa
i
read
a
something
a
something
which
hiding
her
face
oh
certainly
these
genoese
know
more
than
should
reach
a
wife
ear
rosa
oh
jealousy
thou
magnifier
of
trifles
leonora
with
melancholy
enthusiasm
when
he
was
still
fiesco
when
in
the
where
we
damsels
walked
i
saw
him
a
blooming
apollo
blending
the
manly
beauty
of
antinous
such
was
his
noble
and
majestic
deportment
as
if
the
illustrious
state
of
genoa
rested
alone
upon
his
youthful
shoulders
our
eyes
stole
trembling
glances
at
him
and
shrunk
back
as
if
with
conscious
guilt
they
encountered
the
lightning
of
his
looks
ah
arabella
how
we
devoured
those
looks
with
what
anxious
envy
did
every
one
count
those
directed
to
her
companions
they
fell
among
us
like
the
golden
apple
of
discord
tender
eyes
burned
fiercely
soft
bosoms
beat
tumultuously
jealousy
burst
asunder
all
our
bonds
of
friendship
arabella
i
remember
it
well
all
genoa
female
hearts
were
in
rebellious
ferment
for
so
enviable
a
prize
leonora
in
rapture
and
now
to
call
him
mine
giddy
wondrous
fortune
to
call
the
pride
of
genoa
mine
he
who
from
the
chisel
of
the
exhaustless
artist
nature
sprang
forth
combining
every
greatness
of
his
sex
in
the
most
perfect
union
hear
me
damsels
i
can
no
longer
conceal
it
hear
me
i
confide
to
you
something
mysteriously
a
thought
when
i
stood
at
the
altar
with
fiesco
when
his
hand
lay
in
mine
a
thought
too
daring
for
woman
rushed
across
me
this
fiesco
whose
hand
now
lies
in
thine
thy
fiesco
but
hush
let
no
man
hear
us
boast
how
far
he
excels
all
others
of
his
sex

thy
fiesco
ah
could
you
but
share
my
feelings
will
free
genoa
from
its
tyrants

this
dream
haunt

woman

at
the
nuptial
shrine

arabella

be
astonished
to
the
bride

bridal
hour

nobleness
of
my

proud

family

old

it
is
a
pleasure
to
esteem
him

where
i
was
sitting
fiesco
is
inexcusable
julia
and
is
that
all
out
upon
the
jade
am
i
then
to
blame
because
the
count
makes
use
of
his
eyes
smilingly
admiring
herself
fiesco
is
the
fault
of
your
beauty
madam
that
keeps
them
in
such
sweet
slavery
julia
away
with
compliment
where
honor
is
concerned
count
i
insist
on
satisfaction
where
shall
i
find
it
in
you
or
in
my
vengeance
fiesco
find
it
in
the
arms
of
love
of
love
that
would
repair
the
offence
of
jealousy
julia
jealousy
jealousy
poor
thing
what
would
she
wish
for
admiring
herself
in
the
glass
could
she
desire
a
higher
compliment
than
were
i
to
declare
her
taste
my
own
haughtily
doria
and
fiesco
would
not
the
countess
of
lavagna
have
reason
to
feel
honored
if
niece
deigned
to
envy
her
choice
in
a
friendly
tone
offering
the
count
her
hand
to
kiss
i
merely
assume
the
possibility
of
such
a
case
count
fiesco
with
animation
cruel
countess
thus
to
torment
me
i
know
divine
julia
that
respect
is
all
i
ought
to
feel
for
you
my
reason
bids
me
bend
a
subject
knee
before
the
race
of
doria
but
my
heart
adores
the
beauteous
julia
my
love
is
criminal
but
is
also
heroic
and
dares
the
boundaries
of
rank
and
soar
towards
the
dazzling
sun
of
majesty
julia
a
great
and
courtly
falsehood
paraded
upon
stilts
while
his
tongue
deifies
me
his
heart
beats
beneath
the
picture
of
another
fiesco
rather
say
it
beats
indignantly
against
it
and
would
shake
off
the
odious
burden
taking
the
picture
of
leonora
which
is
suspended
by
a
ribbon
from
his
breast
and
delivering
it
to
julia
place
your
own
image
on
that
altar
and
you
will
instantly
annihilate
this
idol
julia
pleased
puts
by
the
picture
hastily
a
great
sacrifice
by
mine
honor
and
which
deserves
my
thanks
hangs
her
own
picture
about
his
neck
so
my
slave
henceforth
bear
your
badge
of
service
exit

transport
julia

not
even
the

my
lord
you
lately
spoke
of
a
young
girl
whom
you
saw
in
the
church
of
lorenzo
gianettino
i
did
my
lad
and
i
must
make
her
acquaintance
lomellino
that
i
can
manage
for
your
grace
gianettino
with
vehemence
can
you
can
you
lomellino
you
were
a
candidate
for
the
procuratorship
you
shall
have
it
lomellino
gracious
prince
it
is
the
second
dignity
in
the
state
more
than
threescore
noblemen
seek
it
and
all
of
them
more
wealthy
and
honorable
than
your
grace
humble
servant
gianettino
indignantly
by
the
name
of
doria
you
shall
be
procurator
the
three
masks
come
forward
what
talk
you
of
nobility
in
genoa
let
them
all
throw
their
ancestry
and
honors
into
the
scale
one
hair
from
the
white
beard
of
my
old
uncle
will
make
it
kick
the
beam
it
is
my
will
that
you
be
procurator
and
that
is
tantamount
to
the
votes
of
the
whole
senate
lomellino
in
a
low
voice
the
damsel
is
the
only
daughter
of
one
verrina
gianettino
the
girl
is
pretty
and
in
spite
of
all
the
devils
in

i
must
possess
her
lomellino
what
my
lord
the
only
child
of
the
most
obstinate
of
our
republicans
gianettino
to
hell
with
your
republicans
shall
my
passion
be
thwarted
by
the
anger
of
a
vassal
is
as
vain
as
to
expect
the
tower
should
fall
when
the
boys
pelt
it
with
the
three
black
masks
step
nearer
with
great
emotion
what
has
the
duke
andreas
gained
his
scars
in
battle
for
their
wives
and
children
only
that
his
nephew
should
court
the
favor
of
these
vagabond
republicans
by
the
name
of
doria
they
shall
swallow
this
fancy
of
mine
or
i
will
plant
a
gallows
over
the
bones
of
my
uncle
on
which
their
genoese
liberty
shall
kick
itself
to
death
the
three

step
back

lomellino
the
damsel
is
at
this

alone
her
father
is
here
and
one
of
those
three
masks
gianettino
excellent
bring
me
instantly
to
her
lomellino
but
you
will
seek
in
her
a
mistress
and
find
a
prude
gianettino
force
is
the
best
rhetoric
lead
me
to
her
would
i
could
see
that
republican
dog
that
durst
stand

lomellino
fiesco
has
become
a
mere
votary
of
pleasure
the
great
world
has
lost
much
in
you
fiesco
but
fiesco
has
lost
nothing
in
giving
up
the
world
to
live
is
to
dream
and
to
dream
pleasantly
is
to
be
wise
can
this
be
done
more
certainly
amid
the
thunders
of
a
throne
where
the
wheels
of
government
creak
incessantly
upon
the
tortured
ear

on
the
heaving
bosom

fiesco

devote
himself
to

thank
thee
for
thy
entertainment

have
been
satisfied
fiesco
that

a
pause
fiesco
i
perceive
some
guests
here
who
do
not
share
the
pleasure
of
the
feast
masks
murmuring
to
each
other
with
indignation
no
not
one
of
us
fiesco
courteously
is
it
possible
that
my
attention
should
have
been
wanting
to
any
one

quick
servants
let
the
music
be
renewed
and
fill
the
goblets
to
the
brim
i
would
not
that
my
friends
should
find
the
time
hang
heavy
will
you
permit
me
to
amuse
you
with
fireworks
would
you
choose
to
see
the
frolics
of
my
harlequin
perhaps
you
would
be
pleased
to
join
the
ladies
or
shall
we
sit
down
to
faro
and
pass
the
time
in
play
a
mask
we
are
accustomed
to
spend
it
in
action
fiesco
a
manly
answer
such
as
bespeaks
verrina
verrina
unmasking
fiesco
is
quicker
to
discover
his
friends
beneath
their
masks
than
they
to
discover
him
beneath
his
fiesco
i
understand
you
not
but
what
means
that
crape
of
mourning
around
your
arm
can
death
have
robbed
verrina
of
a
friend
and
fiesco
not
know
the
loss
verrina
mournful
tales
ill
suit
fiesco
joyful
feasts
fiesco
but
if
a
friend
pressing
his
hand
warmly
friend
of
my
soul
for
whom
must
we
both
mourn
vrrrina
both
both
oh
is
but
too
true
we
both
should
mourn
yet
not
all
sons
lament
their
mother
fiesco
is
long
since
your
mother
was
mingled
with
the
dust
verrina
with
an
earnest
look
i
do
remember
me
that
fiesco
once
called
me
brother
because
we
both
were
sons
of
the
same
country
fiesco
jocosely
oh
is
it
only
that
you
meant
then
but
to
jest
the
mourning
dress
is
worn
for
genoa
true
she
lies
indeed
in
her
last
agonies
the
thought
is
new
and
singular
our
cousin
begins
to
be
a
wit
verrina
fiesco
i
spoke
most
seriously
fiesco
certainly
certainly
a
jest
loses
its
point
when
he
who
makes
it
is
the
first
to
laugh
but
you
you
looked
like
a
mute
at
a
funeral
who
could
have
thought
that
the
austere
verrina
should
in
his
old
age
become
such
a
wag
sacco
come
verrina
he
never
will
be
ours
fiesco
be
merry
brother
let
us
act
the
part
of
the
cunning
heir
who
walks
in
the
funeral
procession
with
loud
lamentations
laughing
to
himself
the
while
under
the
cover
of
his
handkerchief
is
true
we
may
be
troubled
with
a
harsh
be
it
so
we
will
let
her
scold
and
follow
our
own
pleasures
verrina
with
great
emotion
heaven
and
earth
shall
we
then
do
nothing
what
is
to
become
of
you
fiesco
where
am
i
to
seek
that
determined
enemy
of
tyrants
there
was
a
time
when
but
to
see
a
crown
would
have
been
torture
to
you
oh
fallen
son
of
the
republic
by
heaven
if
time
could
so
debase
my
soul
i
would
spurn
immortality
fiesco
o
rigid
censor
let
doria
put
genoa
in
his
pocket
or
barter
it
with
the
robbers
of
tunis
why
should
it
trouble
us
we
will
drown
ourselves
in
floods
of
cyprian
wine
and
revel
it
in
the
sweet
caresses
of
our
fair
ones
verrina
looking
at
him
with
earnestness
are
these
indeed
your
serious
thoughts
fiesco
why
should
they
not
be
my
friend
think
you
is
a
pleasure
to
be
the
foot
of
that
monster
a
republic
no
thanks
be
to
him
who
gives
it
wings
and
deprives
the

of
their
functions
let
gianettino
be
the
duke
affairs
of

shall
lie
heavy
on
our
heads

that
truly
and
seriously
your
meaning
fiesco
andreas
adopts
his
nephew
as
a
son

makes
him
heir
to
his
estates
what
madman
will
dispute
with

the
inheritance
of

now

efforts

your

obliging
scoundrel
he
would
show

gratitude
by
cutting

wholesale
moor
men
like

sir
receive
no
favor
without
acknowledgment
we
know
what
honor
is
fiesco
the
honor
of
moor
which
is
perhaps
more
to
be
relied
on
than
that
of
your
men
of
character
they
break
their
oaths
made
in
the
name
of
god
we
keep
ours
pledged
to
the
devil
fiesco
thou
art
an
amusing
villain
moor
i
rejoice
to
meet
your
approbation
try
me
you
will
find
in
me
a
man
who
is
a
thorough
master
of
his
profession
examine
me
i
can
show
my
testimonials
of
villany
from
every
guild
of
rogues
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
fiesco
indeed
seating
himself
there
are
laws
and
systems
then
even
among
thieves
what
canst
thou
tell
me
of
the
lowest
class
moor
oh
sir
they
are
petty
villains
mere
they
are
a
miserable
set
their
trade
never
produces
a
man
of
genius
is
confined
to
the
whip
and
workhouse
and
at
most
can
lead
but
to
the
gallows
fiesco
a
charming
prospect
i
should
like
to
hear
something
of
a
superior
class
moor
the
next
are
spies
and
informers
tools
of
importance
to
the
great
who
from
their
secret
information
derive
their
own
supposed
omniscience
these
villains
insinuate
themselves
into
the
souls
of
men
like
leeches
they
draw
poison
from
the
heart
and
spit
it
forth
against
the
very
source
from
whence
it
came
fiesco
i
understand
thee
go
on
moor
then
come
the
conspirators
villains
that
deal
in
poison
and
bravoes
that
rush
upon
their
victims
from
some
secret
covert
cowards
they
often
are
but
yet
fellows
that
sell
their
souls
to
the
devil
as
the
fees
of
their
apprenticeship
the
hand
of
justice
binds
their
limbs
to
the
rack
or
plants
their
cunning
heads
on
spikes
this
is
the
third
class
fiesco
but
tell
me
when
comes
thy
own
moor
patience
my
lord
that
is
the
very
point
i
coming
to
i
have
already
passed
through
all
the
stages
that
i
mentioned
my
genius
soon
soared
above
their
limits
was
but
last
night
i
performed
my
masterpiece
in
the
third
this
evening
i
attempted
the
fourth
and
proved
myself
a
bungler
fiesco
and
how
do
you
describe
that
class
moor
with
energy
they
are
men
who
seek
their
prey
within
four
walls
cutting
their
way
through
every
danger
they
strike
at
once
and
by
their
first
salute
save
him
whom
they
approach
the
trouble
of
returning
thanks
for
a
second
between
ourselves
they
are
called
the
express
couriers
of
hell
and
when
beelzebub
is
hungry
they
want
but
a
wink
and
he
gets
his
mutton
warm
fiesco
thou
art
an
hardened
villain

a
tool
i
want

i
guess
what
you
would
say
calcagno
will
four
patriots
alone
be
sufficient
to
destroy
this
mighty
hydra
shall
we
not
stir
up
the

or
draw
the
nobles
in
to

our
party
verrina
i
understand
you
now
hear
my
advice
i
have
long
engaged
a
painter
who
has
been
exerting
all
his
skill
to
paint
the
fall
of
appius
claudius
fiesco
is
an
adorer
of
the
arts
and
soon
warmed
by
ennobling
scenes
we
will
send
this
picture
to
his
house
and
will
be
present
when
he
contemplates
it
perhaps
the
sight
may
rouse
his
dormant
spirit
perhaps
bourgognino
no
more
of
him
increase
the
danger
not
the
sharers
in
it
so
valor
bids
long
have
i
felt
a
something
within
my
breast
that
nothing
would
appease
what
was
now
bursts
upon
me
springing
up
with
enthusiasm
was
a
tyrant
the
scene
closes
act
ii
scene
an
in
the
palace
of
fiesco
leonora
and
arabella
arabella
no
no
you
were
mistaken
your
eyes
were
blinded
by
jealousy
leonora
it
was
julia
to
the
life
seek
not
to
persuade
me
otherwise
my
picture
was
suspended
by
a
ribbon
this
was
my
doom
is
fixed
irrevocably
scene
ii
the
former
and
julia
julia
entering
in
an
affected
manner
the
count
offered
me
his
palace
to
see
the
procession
to
the
the
time
will
be
tedious
you
will
entertain
me
madam
while
the
chocolate
is
preparing
arabella
goes
out
and
returns
soon
afterwards
leonora
do
you
wish
that
i
should
invite
company
to
meet
you
julia
ridiculous
as
if
i
should
come
hither
in
search
of
company
you
will
amuse
me
madam
walking
up
and
down
and
admiring
herself
if
you
are
able
madam
at
any
rate
i
shall
lose
nothing
arabella
sarcastically
your
splendid
dress
alone
will
be
the
loser
only
think
how
cruel
it
is
to
deprive
the
eager
eyes
of
our
young
beaux
of
such
a
treat
ah
and
the
glitter
of
your
sparkling
jewels
on
which
it
almost
wounds
the
sight
to
look
good
heavens
you
seem
to
have
plundered
the
whole
ocean
of
its
pearls
julia
before
a
glass
you
are
not
accustomed
to
such
things
miss
but
hark
ye
miss
pray
has
your
mistress
also
hired
your
tongue
madam
fine
indeed
to
permit
your
domestics
thus
to
address
your
guests
leonora
is
my
misfortune
signora
that
my
want
of
spirits
prevents
me
from
enjoying
the
pleasure
of
your
company
julia
an
ugly
fault
that
to
be
dull
and
spiritless
be
active
sprightly
witty
yours
is
not
the
way
to
attach
your
husband
to
you
leonora
i
know
but
one
way
countess
let
yours
ever
be
the
sympathetic
medium
julia
pretending
not
to
mind
her
how
you
dress
madam
for
shame
pay
more
attention
to
your
personal
appearance
have
recourse
to
art
where
nature
has
been
unkind
put
a
little
paint
on
those
cheeks
which
look
so
pale
with
spleen
poor
creature
your
puny
face
will
never
find
a
bidder
leonora
in
a
lively
manner
to
arabella
congratulate
me
girl
it
is
impossible
i
can
have
lost
my
fiesco
or
if
i
have
the
loss
must
be
but
trifling
the
chocolate
is
brought
arabella
pours
it
out
julia
do
you
talk
of
losing
fiesco
good
god
how
could
you
ever
conceive
the
ambitious
idea
of
possessing
him
why
my
child
aspire
to
such
a
height
a
height
where
you
can
not
but
be
seen
and
must
come
into
comparison
with
others
indeed
my
dear
he
was
a
knave
or
a
fool
who
joined
you
with
fiesco
taking
her
hand
with
a
look
of
compassion
poor
soul
the
man
who
is
received
in
the
assemblies
of
fashionable
life
could
never
be
a
suitable
match
for
you
she
takes
a
dish
of
chocolate
leonora
smiling
at
arabella
if
he
were
he
would
not
wish
to
mix
with
such
assemblies
julia
the
count
is
handsome
fashionable
elegant
he
is
so
fortunate
as
to
have
formed
connections
with
people
of
rank
he
is
lively
and
now
when
he
severs
himself
from
these
circles
of
elegance
and
refinement
and
returns
home
warm
with
their
impressions
what
does
he
meet
his
wife
receives
him
with
a
commonplace
tenderness
damps
his
fire
with
an
insipid
chilling
kiss
and
measures
out
her
attentions
to
him
with
a
niggardly
economy
poor
husband
here
a
blooming
beauty
smiles
upon
him
there
he
is
nauseated
by
a
peevish
sensibility
signora
signora
for
god
sake
consider
if
he
have
not
lost
his
understanding
which
will
he
choose
leonora
offering
her
a
cup
of
chocolate
you
madam
if
he
have
lost
it
julia
good
this
sting
shall
return
into
your
own
bosom
tremble
for
your
mockery
but
before
you
tremble
blush
leonora
do
you
then
know
what
it
is
to
blush
signora
but
why
not
is
a
toilet
trick
julia
oh
see
this
poor
creature
must
be
provoked
if
one
would
draw
from
her
a
spark
of
wit
well
let
it
pass
this
time
madam
you
were
bitter
give
me
your
hand
in
token
of
reconciliation
leonora
offering
her
hand
with
a
significant
look
countess
my
anger
shall
trouble
you

offering
her
hand
generous
indeed
yet
may
i
not
be
so

maliciously

i
must
love
that
person
whose
image
i
bear
constantly
about
me
leonora
blushing
and
confused
what
do
you
say
let
me
hope
the
conclusion
is
too
hasty
julia
i
think
so
too
the
heart
waits
not
the
guidance
of
the
senses
real
sentiment
needs
no
breastwork
of
outward
ornament
leonora
heavens
where
did
you
learn
such
a
truth
julia
was
in

of

oh
most
vilely
the
very
name
of
doria
shakes
them
like
an
gianettino
is
as
hateful
to
them
as
death

the
cat
doria
has
devoured
them
and
now
is
going
to
feast

perhaps
be

do
they
not

any
dog
against
that
cat
moor
with
an
affected
carelessness
the
town
was
murmuring
much
of
a
certain
poh
why
i
have
actually
forgotten

fiesco
rising
blockhead
that

as
easy

what
do

about
my
gayeties

count

genius
full
of
spirit
and
popularity
master
of
four
millions

a

like
fiesco
whom
at

first
call
all
hearts
would
fly
to
meet
fiesco
turns
away
contemptuously
to
hear
such
things
from
such
a
scoundrel
moor
many
lamented
that
the
chief
of
genoa
should
slumber
over
the
ruin
of
his
country
and
many
sneered
most
men
condemned
you
all
bewailed
the
state
which
thus
had
lost
you
a
jesuit
pretended
to
have
smelt
out
the
fox
that
lay
disguised

fiesco
one

what
say

for
the

imperiali
moor
what
i
would
rather
be
excused
from
repeating
fiesco
out
with
it
the
bolder
the
more
welcome
what
are
their
murmurings
moor
is
not
a
murmur
at
all
the
hotels
and
public
walks
in
the
at
the
exchange
they
proclaim
aloud
fiesco
what
i
command
thee

retreating
that
you
are
a

fiesco
well
take
this
sequin
for

that
they
may
play
merry
andrew

how
did

humorously
why
fool
they
looked
like
poor

fiesco
fool
fellow
art
thou
mad
moor
pardon
i
had
a
mind
for
a
few
more
sequins
fiesco
laughing
gives
him
another
sequin
well
like
poor
knaves
moor
who
receive
pardon
at
the
very
block
they
are
yours
both
soul
and
body
fiesco
i
glad
of
it
they
turn
the
scale
among
the
populace
of
genoa
moor
what
a
scene
it
was
zounds
i
almost
acquired
a
relish
for
benevolence
they
caught
me
round
the
neck
like
madmen
the
very
girls
seemed
in
love
with
my
black
visage
that
as
as
the
moon
in
an
eclipse
gold
thought
i
is
omnipotent
it
makes
even
a
moor
look
fair
fiesco
that
thought
was
better
than
the
soil
which
gave
it
birth
these
words
are
favorable
but
do
they
bespeak
actions
of
equal
import
moor
yes
as
the
murmuring
of
the
distant
thunder
foretells
the
approaching
storm
the
people
lay
their
heads
together
they
collect
in
parties
break
off
their
talk
whenever
a
stranger
passes
by
throughout
genoa
reigns
a
gloomy
silence
this
discontent
hangs
like
a
threatening
tempest
over
the
republic
come
wind
then
hail
and
lightning
will
burst
forth
fiesco

hark
what
is
that
confused
noise
moor
going
to
the
window
it
is
the
tumult
of
the
crowd
returning
from
the
fiesco
is
the
election
of
a
procurator

my

it
is
impossible
that
the
sitting
should

i
go
thither
it

went
right
bring
me
my

my
golden
chain
moor
sir
i
have
stolen

pawned
it
fiesco

i
am
glad
to
hear
moor

how
are
there
no
more
sequins
for
me
fiesco
no
you
forgot
the
cloak
moor
ah
i
was
wrong

the

been
rash
the

methinks
the

be
on
what
does
genoa
resolve
fiesco
genoa
genoa
name
it
not
is
rotten
and
crumbles
wherever
you
touch
it
do
you
reckon
on
the
nobles
perhaps
because
they
put
on
grave
faces
look
mysterious
when
state
affairs
are
mentioned
talk
not
of

their
heroism
is
stifled
among
the
bales
of
their
levantine
merchandise
their
souls
hover
anxiously
over
their
india
fleet
zenturione
learn
to
esteem
our
nobles
more
justly
scarcely
was
doria
haughty
action
done
when
hundreds
of
them
rushed
into

street
tearing
their

the

was
dispersed
fiesco
sarcastically
like
frighted
pigeons
when
the
vulture
darts
upon

zenturione
no
fiercely
like
when
a

falls

zibo
the

are
enraged
what
may
we
not
expect
from
the
fury
of
the
wounded

fiesco
laughing
the
blind
unwieldy
monster

at

rattles
its
heavy
bones
threatening

gaping
jaws
to
devour

the
epoch
of
the
masters
of
the

is
past
genoa
is
sunk
beneath
the

of
its

its

genoa

no

traitor
to
the
state
and
hast
attacked
its
vital
principle
mark
me
boy
that
principle
is
subordination
because
the
shepherd
retired
in
the
evening
from
his
labor
thoughtest
thou
the
flock
deserted
because
andreas
head
is
white
with
age
thoughtest
thou
like
a
villain
to
trample
on
the
laws

boils
the
blood

has
trembled
andreas
be
silent
i
command
thee
when
i
speak
the
sea
itself
is
wont
to

attention
thou
hast
insulted
the
majesty
of
justice
in
its
very
sanctuary
rebel
dost
thou
know
what
punishment
that
crime
demands
now

gianettino

struck
and

his
eyes
on
the
ground
without
speaking
wretched
andreas
in
thy
own
heart
hast
thou
fostered
the
canker
of
thy
renown
i
built
up
a
fabric
for
genoa
which
should
mock
the
lapse
of
ages
and
am
myself
the
first
to
cast
a
firebrand
into
it
thank
my
gray
head
which
would
be
laid
in
the
grave
by
a
relation

thank
my
unjust
love

on

scaffold
i
pour
not
out
thy
rebellious

gianettino
looks
after
the

speechless
with
anger
lomellino
entering
breathless
and
terrified
lomellino
what
have
i
seen
what
have
i
heard
fly
prince
fly
quickly
all
is
lost
gianettino
with
inward
rage
what
was
there
to
lose
lomellino
genoa
prince
i
come
from
the
the
people
were
crowding
round
a
moor
who
was
dragged
along
bound
with
cords
the
count
of
lavagna
with
above
three
hundred
nobles
followed
to
the
criminal
court
the
moor
had
been
employed
to
assassinate
fiesco
and
in
the
attempt
was
seized
gianettino
stamping
violently
on
the
ground
what
are
all
the
devils
of
hell
let
loose
at
once
lomellino
they
questioned
him
most
strictly
concerning
his
employer
the
moor
confessed
nothing
they
tried
the
first
degree
of
torture
still
he
confessed
nothing
they
put
him
to
the
second
then
he
spoke
he
spoke
my
gracious
lord
how
could
you
trust
your
honor
to
such
a
villain
gianettino
fiercely
ask
me
no
question
lomellino
hear
the
rest
scarcely
was
the
word
doria
uttered
i
would
sooner
have
seen
my
name
inscribed
in
the
infernal
register
than
have
heard
yours
thus
mentioned
scarcely
was
it
uttered
when
fiesco
showed
himself
to
the
people
you
know
the
man
how
winningly
he
pleads
how
he
is
wont
to
play
the
usurer
with
the
hearts
of
the
multitude
the
whole
assembly
hung
upon
his
looks
breathless
with
indignation
he
spoke
little
but
bared
his
bleeding
arm
the
crowd
contended
for
the
falling
drops
as
if
for
sacred
relics
the
moor
was
given
up
to
his
disposal
and
fiesco
a
mortal
blow
for
us
fiesco
pardoned
him
now
the
confined
anger
of
the
people
burst
forth
in
one
tumultuous
clamor
each
breath
annihilated
a
doria
and
fiesco
was
borne
home
amidst
a
thousand
joyful
acclamations
gianettino
with
a
ferocious
laugh
let
the
flood
of
tumult
swell
up
to
my
very
throat
the
emperor
that
sound
alone
shall
strike
them
to
the
earth
so
that
not
a
murmur
shall
be
heard
in
genoa
lomellino
bohemia
is
far
from
hence
if
the
emperor
come
speedily
he
may
perhaps
be
present
at
your
funeral
feast
gianettino
drawing
forth
a
letter
with
a
great
seal
is
fortunate
that
he
is
here
already
art
thou
surprised
at
this
and
didst
thou
think
me
mad
enough
to
brave
the
fury
of
enraged
republicans
had
i
not
known
they
were
betrayed
and
sold
lomellino
with
astonishment
i
know
not
what
to
think
gianettino
but
i
have
thought
of
something
which
thou
couldst
not
know
my
plan
is
formed
ere
two
days
are
past
twelve
senators
must
fall
doria

charles
protects
him
thou
seemest
astonished

heart
is
too
narrow
to
comprehend
a
twelvefold
murder
gianettino
fool
that
thou
art
the
throne
will
absolve
the
deed
i
consulted
with
the
ministers
of
charles
on
the
strong
party
which
france
still
has
in
genoa
and
by
which
she
might
a
second
time
seize
on
it
unless
they
should
be
rooted
out
this
worked
upon
the
emperor
he
approved
my
projects

thou
shalt
write
what
i
will
dictate
to
thee

whilst
i
am
admiring
the

the
work
i
could
stand
gazing
on
it
regardless
of
an
earthquake
take
away
your
picture
the
wealth
of
genoa
would
scarcely
reach
the
value
of
this

noblest
reward

present
it
to

stay
romano
he
walks
majestically
up
and
down
the
room
seeming
to
reflect
on
something
of
importance
sometimes
he
casts
a
quick
and
penetrating
glance
at
the
others
at
last
he
takes
romano
by
the
hand
and
leads
him
to

the

follow
me
to
yon
churchyard
where
corruption
preys
on
the
mouldering
remnants
of
mortality
and
death
holds
his
fearful
banquet
where
shrieks
of
damned
souls
delight
the
listening
fiends

weeps

fruitless

me
my

to
where
the
condition
of
this

is
changed

throws
off

i

to
thee

you

thy

is
warm
and
crimson
thy
heart
is
soft
and
tender
such
natures
are
alive
to
human
kindness
this
warmth
of

melts
my
obdurate
wisdom
if
the
frost
of
age
or
sorrow
leaden
pressure
had
chilled
the
springtide
vigor
of
thy
spirits
if
black
congealed
blood
had
closed
the
avenues
of
thy
heart
against
the
approaches
of
humanity
then
would
thy
mind
be
attuned
to
the
language
of
my
grief
and
thou
wouldst
look
with
admiration
on
my
project
bourgognino
i
will
hear
it
and
embrace
it
as
my
own
verrina
not
so
my
son
verrina
will
not
wound
thy
heart
with
it
o
scipio
heavy

more
dark

horrible
than

too
vast
to
be
contained
within
the

mark
me
my

alone
shall
execute

my

can
not
alone
support
the
weight
of
it
if
i
were
proud
scipio
i
might
say
greatness
unshared
is
torture
it
was
a
burden
to
the

he
created

neither
ask
thy

i
know
my
inward
struggles

hear
these

thou

is
not
this
to

upon

over

spreading
out
his

as
if
to

subjection
all

ocean

certain
though
the
cunning

ennoble
not

doth
the

ennoble
the
thief
it
is
base
to
filch
a
purse
daring
to
embezzle
a
million

it
is
immeasurably
great
to
steal
a
diadem
as
guilt
extends
its
sphere
the
infamy

pause

with
energy
to
obey

dizzying
gulf

wide
as
from
the
lowest
depths
of

to
the
throne
of
the
almighty
in
an
elevated
tone
from
that
awful
height
to
look
down
securely
upon
the
impetuous
whirlpool
of
mankind
where
blind
fortune
holds
capricious
sway
to
quaff
at
the
fountainhead
unlimited
draughts
from
the
rich
cup
of
pleasure
to
hold
that
armed
giant
law
beneath
my
feet

and
see
it
struggle
with
fruitless
efforts
against
the
sacred
power
of
majesty
to
tame
the
stubborn
passions
of
the
people
and
curb
them
with
a
playful
rein
as

astonishment

you

i
know
not
why
i
should
preserve
its
small
remains
for
grief
to
feed
on
fiesco
grief
my
love
i
thought
that
to
be
free
from
cares
of
state
was
happiness
leonora
it
may
be
so
yet
do
i
feel
that
my
weak
heart
is
breaking
amidst
this
happiness
i
come
sir
to
trouble
you
with
a
trifling
request
if
you
can
spare
a
moment
time
to
hear
me
these
seven
months
past
i
have
indulged
the
pleasing
dream
of
being
countess
of
lavagna
it
now
has
passed
away
and
left
a
painful
weight
upon
my
mind
amid
the
pleasures
of
my
innocent
childhood
i
must
seek
relief
to
my
disordered
spirits
permit
me
therefore
to
return
to
the
arms
of
my
beloved
mother
fiesco
with
astonishment
countess
leonora
my
heart
is
a
poor
trembling
thing
which
you
should
pity
even
the
least
remembrance
of
my
visionary
joy
might
wound
my
sickly
fancy
i
therefore
restore
the
last
memorials
of
your
kindness
to
their
rightful
owner
she
lays
some
trinkets
on
the
table
this
too
that
like
a
dagger
struck
my
heart
presenting
a
letter
this
too
going
to
rush
out
of
the
door
in
tears
and
i
will
retain
nothing
but
the
wound
fiesco
agitated
hastens
after
and
detains
her
leonora
for
sake
stay
leonora
falls
into
his
arms
exhausted
to
be
your
wife
was
more
than
i
deserved
but
she
who
was
your
wife
deserved
at
least
respect
how
bitter
is
the
tongue
of
calumny
how
the
wives
and
maidens
of
genoa
now
look
down
upon
me
see
they
say
how
droops
the
haughty
one
whose
vanity
aspired
to
fiesco
cruel
punishment
of
my
pride
i
triumphed
over
my
whole
sex
when
fiesco
led
me

it
is
so
worthy
of
the
manly

calcagno
we
must
execute
it
either
as
soldiers
or

the
first
is
dangerous
because
we
must
have
many
confidants
is
also
doubtful
because
the

are
not
all

they

swallow

in

permit

you
men

heart
let
me
play
the
chambermaid
for
once
she
sits
down
he
arranges
her
dress
gianettino
aside
to
lomellino
poor
frivolous
fellow
fiesco
engaged
about
her
bosom
now
see
this
i
prudently
conceal
the
senses
should
always
be
blind
messengers
and
not
know
the
secret
compact
between
nature
and
fancy
julia
that
is
trifling
fiesco
not
at
all
for
consider
the
prettiest
novelty
loses
all
its
zest
when
once
become
familiar
our
senses
are
but
the
rabble
of
our
inward
republic
the
noble
live
by
them
but
elevate
themselves
above
their
low
degenerate
tastes
having
adjusted
her
toilet
he
leads
her
to
a
glass
now
by
my
honor
this
must
on
the
morrow
be
fashion
politely
may
i
have
the
honor
of
leading
you
so
abroad
countess
julia
the
cunning
flatterer
how
artfully
he
lays
his

to
ensnare
me
no
i
have
a
headache
and
will
stay
at
home
fiesco
pardon
me
countess
you
may
be
so
cruel
but
surely
you
will
not
a
company
of
florentine
comedians
arrive
at
my
palace
most
of
the
genoese
ladies
will
be
present
this
evening
at
their
performance
and
i
am
uncertain
whom
to
place
in
the
chief
box
without
offending
others
there
is
but
one
expedient
making
a
low
bow
if
you
would
condescend
signora
julia
blushing
retires
to
a
side
apartment
laura
gianettino
approaching
fiesco
count
you
remember
an
unpleasant
circumstance
fiesco
interrupting
him
is
my
wish
prince
we
should
both
forget
it
the
actions
of
men
are
regulated
by
their
knowledge
of
each
other
it
is
my
fault
that
you
knew
me
so
imperfectly
gianettino
i
shall
never
think
of
it
without
craving
your
pardon
from
my
inmost
soul
fiesco
nor
i
without
forgiving
you
from
my
heart
core
julia
returns
her
dress
a
little
altered
gianettino
count
i
just
now
recollect
that
you
are
going
to
cruise
against
the
turks
fiesco
this
evening
we
weigh
anchor
on
that
account
i
had
some
apprehensions
from
which
my
friend
doria
kindness
may
deliver
me
gianettino
obsequiously
most
willingly
command
my
utmost
influence
fiesco
the
circumstance
might
cause
a
concourse
toward
the
harbor
and
about
my
palace
which
the
duke
your
uncle
might
misinterpret
gianettino
in
a
friendly
manner
i
manage
that
for
you
continue
your
preparations
and
may
success
attend
your
enterprise

it
was
my
vice
alone
that
could
protect
my
virtue
my
pride
alone
defied
your
artifices
thus
far
my
principles
prevailed
and
all
your
arts
were
foiled
but
in
despair
of
every
other
suit
you
made
appeal
to
passion
and
here
my
principles
deserted
me
fiesco
with
levity

what
loss
was
that

the

wisdom
of

a
sorry
precaution
for
the

of
this
weak

in

is
the

upon

wavering
of

that

i
understand
but
half
your
meaning
yet
i
begin
to
tremble
fiesco
significantly
leonora
i
once
saw
you
yield
the
place
of
honor
to
another
i
saw
you
in
the
presence
of
the
nobles
receive
the
second
compliment
leonora
that
sight
tormented
me
i
resolved
it
should
be
so
no
longer
henceforth
it
ceases
do
you
hear
the
warlike
noise
which
echoes
through
my
palace
what
you
suspect
is
true
retire
to
rest
countess
you
shall
awake
duchess
of
genoa
leonora
clasping
her
hands
together
and
throwing
herself
into
a
chair
o
god
my
very
fears
i
am
undone
fiesco
seriously
and
with
dignity
let
me
speak
out
my
love
two
of
my
ancestors
wore
the
triple
crown
the
blood
of
the
fiescos
flows
not
pure
unless
beneath
the
purple
shall
your
husband
only
reflect
a
borrowed
splendor
in
a
more
energetic
manner
what
shall
he
owe
his
rank
alone
to
capricious
chance
which
from
the
ashes
of
mouldering
greatness
has
patched
together
a
john
louis
fiesco
no
leonora
i
am
too
proud
to
accept
from
others
what
my
own
powers
may
achieve
this
night
the
hereditary
titles
of
my
ancestors
shall
return
to
deck
their
tombs
lavagna
counts
exist
no
longer
a
race
of
princes
shall
begin
leonora
mournfully
and
giving
way
to
imagination
i
see
my
husband
fall
transfixed
by
deadly
wounds
in
a
hollow
voice
i
see
them
bear
my
husband
mangled
corpse
towards
me
starting
up
the
first
the
only
ball
has
pierced
fiesco
heart
fiesco
tenderly
seizing
her
hand
be
calm
my
love
the
only
ball
will
not
strike
me
leonora
looking
steadfastly
at
him
does
fiesco
so
confidently
challenge
heaven
if
in
the
scope
of
countless
possibilities
one
chance
alone
were
adverse
that
one
might
happen
and
i
should
lose
my
husband
think
that
thou
venturest
heaven
fiesco
and
though
a
million
chances
were
in
thy
favor
wouldst
thou
dare
tempt
the
almighty
by
risking
on
a
cast
thy
hopes
of
everlasting
happiness
no
my
husband
when
thy
whole
being
is
at
stake
each
throw
is
blasphemy
fiesco
be
not
alarmed
fortune

i
are
better
friends
leonora
ah
say
you
so
fiesco
you
who
have
watched
the
game
which
some
call
pastime
have
you
not
seen
the
sly
deceiver
fortune
how
she
leads
on
her
votary
with
gradual
favors
till
heated
with
success
he
rushes
headlong
and
stakes
his
all
upon
a
single
cast
then
in
the
decisive
moment
she
forsakes
him
a
victim
of
his
rashness
and
stood
you
then
unmoved
oh
my
husband
think
not
that
thou
hast
but
to
show
thyself
among
the
people
to
be
adored
is
no
slight
task
to
rouse
republicans
from
their
slumber
and
turn
them
loose
like
the
unbridled
steed
just
conscious
of
his
hoofs
trust
not
those
traitors
they
among
them
who
are
most
discerning
even
while
they
instigate
thy
valor
fear
it
the
vulgar
worship
thou
with
senseless
and
unprofitable
adoration
whichever
way
i
look
fiesco
is
undone
fiesco
pacing
the
room
in
great
emotion
to
be
irresolute
is
the
most
certain
danger
he
that
aspires
to
greatness
must
be
daring
leonora

alas
thy
towering
spirit
ill
accords

the
fond

should
fortune
favor
thy
attempt
shouldst
thou
obtain
dominion
alas
i
then
shall
be
but
the
more
wretched
condemned
to
misery
shouldst
thou
fail
if
thou
succeed
to
misery
still
greater
here
is
no
choice
but
evil
unless

my
fiesco

stormy
atmosphere
that
surrounds

the
tender
plant
of
love
must
perish

heart
of

that
heart
fiesco
is
not
vast
enough
for
two
idols
idols
so
hostile
to
each
other
love
has
tears
and
can
sympathize
with
tears
ambition
has
eyes
of
stone
from
which
no
drop
of
tenderness
can
distil
love
has
but
one
favored
object

is
indifferent

all

ambition
with
insatiable
hunger

amid
the
spoil
of
nature
and
changes
the
immense
world
into
one
dark
and
horrid
love
paints
in
every
desert
an
elysium
and
when
thou
wouldest
recline
upon
my
bosom
the
cares
of
empires
or
rebellious
vassals
would
fright
away
repose
if
i
should
throw
myself
into

hear
a
murderer
rushing
forth
to
strike
thee

urge
thy
trembling
flight

suspicion
would
at

domestic
concord
if
thy

should

thee
a

draught

wouldst
with
horror
push
away
the
goblet

call
it
poison

years

my
fancy
painted
that
triumphant
hour
when
i
should
present
thee
to
genoa
as
her
duchess
methought
i
saw
the
lovely
blush
that
tinged
thy
modest
cheek
the
timid
heaving
of
thy
beauteous
bosom
beneath
the
snowy
gauze
i
heard
the
gentle
murmurs
of
thy
voice
which
died
away
in
rapture
more
lively
ah
how
intoxicating
to
my
soul
were
the
proud
acclamations
of
the
people
how
did
my
love
rejoice
to
see
its
triumph
marked
in
the
sinking
envy
of
its
rivals
leonora
the
hour
which
should
confirm
these
hopes
is
come
thy
fiesco
is
duke
of
genoa
and
yet
the
meanest
beggar
would
not
exchange
his
poverty
for
my
greatness
and
my
sufferings

has
a

to
share
his
troubles
with

overlooked

significantly

should
hope
some

to
make

an
adequate

confers

bitterness

thou
hast
committed
a

against
the
majesty

to
lead
thy
hands

in
