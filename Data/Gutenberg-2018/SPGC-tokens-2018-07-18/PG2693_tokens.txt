greyfriars
bobby
by
eleanor
atkinson
i
when
the
boomed
from
edinburgh
castle
bobby
gave
a
startled
yelp
he
was
only
a
little
country
dog
the
very
youngest
and
smallest
and
shaggiest
of
skye
terriers
bred
on
a
heathery
slope
of
the
pentland
hills
where
the
loudest
sound
was
the
bark
of
a
collie
or
the
tinkle
of
a
that
morning
he
had
come
to
the
weekly
market
with
auld
jock
a
farm
laborer
and
the
grassmarket
of
the
scottish
capital
lay
in
the
narrow
valley
at
the
southern
base
of
castle
crag
two
hundred
feet
above
it
the
was
mounted
in
the
battery
on
an
overhanging
ledge
of
rock
in
any
part
of
the
city
the
report
of
the
gun
was
sufficiently
alarming
but
in
the
grassmarket
it
was
an
explosion
directly
overhead
it
needed
to
be
heard
but
once
there
to
be
registered
on
even
a
little
dog
brain
bobby
had
heard
it
many
times
and
he
never
failed
to
yelp
a
sharp
protest
at
the
outrage
to
his
ears
but
as
the
gunshot
was
always
followed
by
a
certain
happy
event
it
started
in
his
active
little
mind
a
train
of
pleasant
associations
in
bobby
day
of
youth
and
that
was
in
when
queen
victoria
was
a
happy
wife
and
mother
with
all
her
bairns
about
her
knees
in
windsor
or
balmoral
the
grassmarket
of
edinburgh
was
still
a
bit
of
the
middle
ages
as
picturesquely
decaying
and
gothic
as
german
nuremberg
beside
the
classic
corn
exchange
it
had
no
modern
buildings
north
and
south
along
its
greatest
length
the
sunken
quadrangle
was
faced
by
tall
old
houses
of
stone
plastered
like
swallows
nests
to
the
rocky
slopes
behind
them
across
the
eastern
end
where
the
valley
suddenly
narrowed
to
the
street
of
the
cowgate
the
market
was
spanned
by
the
lofty
crowded
arches
of
george
iv
bridge
this
viaduct
thoroughfare
that
carried
a
double
line
of
buildings
within
its
parapet
leaped
the
gorge
from
the
tall
old
gothic
rookeries
on
high
street
ridge
just
below
the
castle
esplanade
it
cleared
the
roofs
of
the
tallest
oldest
houses
that
swarmed
up
the
steep
banks
from
the
cowgate
and
ran
on
by
easy
descent
to
the
main
gateway
of
greyfriars
kirkyard
at
the
lower
top
of
the
southern
rise
greyfriars
two
kirks
formed
together
under
one
continuous
roof
a
long
low
buttressed
building
without
tower
or
spire
the
new
kirk
was
of
queen
anne
day
but
the
old
kirk
was
built
before
ever
the
pilgrims
set
sail
for
america
it
had
been
but
one
of
several
sacred
buildings
set
in
a
monastery
garden
that
sloped
pleasantly
to
the
open
valley
of
the
grassmarket
and
looked
up
the
castle
heights
unhindered
in
day
this
garden
had
shrunk
to
a
long
narrow
that
extended
from
the
rear
of
the
line
of
buildings
that
fronted
on
the
market
up
the
slope
across
the
hilltop
and
to
where
the
land
began
to
fall
away
again
down
the
burghmuir
from
the
grassmarket
kirk
and
kirkyard
lay
hidden
behind
and
above
the
crumbling
grandeur
of
noble
halls
and
mansions
that
had
fallen
to
the
grimiest
tenements
of
edinburgh
slums
from
the
end
of
the
bridge
approach
there
was
a
glimpse
of
massive
walls
of
pointed
windows
and
of
monumental
tombs
through
a
gate
of
wrought
iron
that
was
alcoved
and
wedged
in
between
the
ancient
guildhall
of
the
candlemakers
and
a
row
of
prosperous
little
shops
in
greyfriars
place
a
quarry
pit
in
the
very
heart
of
old
edinburgh
the
grassmarket
was
a
place
of
historic
echoes
the
yelp
of
a
little
dog
there
would
scarce
seem
worthy
of
record
more
in
harmony
with
its
stirring
history
was
the
report
of
the
at
one
every
day
there
was
a
puff
of
smoke
high
up
in
the
blue
or
gray
or
squally
sky
then
a
deafening
crash
and
a
back
fire
fusillade
of
echoes
the
oldest
frequenter
of
the
market
never
got
used
to
it
on
wednesday
as
the
shot
broke
across
the
babel
of
shrill
bargaining
every
man
in
the
place
jumped
and
not
one
was
quicker
of
recovery
than
wee
bobby
instantly
ashamed
as
an
intelligent
little
dog
who
knew
the
import
of
the
gun
should
be
bobby
denied
his
alarm
in
a
tiny
pink
yawn
of
boredom
then
he
went
briskly
about
his
urgent
business
of
finding
auld
jock
the
market
was
closed
in
five
minutes
the
great
open
space
was
as
empty
of
living
men
as
greyfriars
kirkyard
on
a
drovers
and
hostlers
disappeared
at
once
into
the
cheap
and
noisy
entertainment
of
the
white
hart
inn
that
fronted
the
market
and
set
its
squalid
back
against
castle
rock
farmers
rapidly
deserted
it
for
the
clean
country
dwellers
in
the
tenements
darted
up
wynds
and
blind
closes
climbed
twisting
turnpike
stairs
to
windy
roosts
under
the
gables
or
they
scuttled
through
noble
doors
into
foul
courts
and
hallways
beggars
and
pickpockets
swarmed
under
the
arches
of
the
bridge
to
swell
the
evil
smelling
human
river
that
flowed
at
the
dark
and
slimy
bottom
of
the
cowgate
a
chill
november
wind
tore
at
the
creaking
iron
cross
of
the
knights
of
john
on
the
highest
gable
of
the
temple
tenements
that
turned
its
decaying
back
on
the
kirkyard
of
the
greyfriars
low
clouds
were
tangled
and
torn
on
the
castle
battlements
a
few
horses
stood
about
munching
oats
from
flocks
of
sparrows
fluttered
down
from
timbered
galleries
and
rocky
ledges
to
feast
on
scattered
grain
swallows
wheeled
in
wide
descending
spirals
from
mud
villages
under
the
cornices
to
catch
flies
rats
scurried
out
of
holes
and
gleaned
in
the
deserted
corn
exchange
and
and
the
empty
raced
the
frantic
little
terrier
in
search
of
auld
jock
bobby
knew
as
well
as
any
man
that
it
was
the
dinner
hour
with
the
it
was
auld
jock
custom
to
go
up
to
a
snug
little
restaurant
that
was
patronized
chiefly
by
the
decent
poor
small
shopkeepers
clerks
tenant
farmers
and
medical
students
living
in
cheap
lodgings
in
greyfriars
place
there
in
ye
olde
greyfriars
owned
by
john
traill
and
four
doors
beyond
the
kirkyard
gate
was
a
cozy
little
inglenook
that
auld
jock
and
bobby
had
come
to
look
upon
as
their
own
at
its
back
above
a
recessed
oaken
settle
and
a
table
a
tiny
paned
window
looked
up
and
over
a
retaining
wall
into
the
ancient
place
of
the
dead
the
view
of
the
and
crowded
mounds
and
thickets
of
old
slabs
and
throughstones
girt
all
about
by
monuments
and
vaults
and
shut
in
on
the
north
and
east
by
the
backs
of
shops
and
lofty
slum
tenements
could
not
be
said
to
be
cheerful
it
suited
auld
jock
however
for
what
mind
he
had
was
of
a
melancholy
turn
from
his
place
on
the
floor
between
his
master
boots
bobby
could
not
see
the
kirkyard
but
it
would
not
in
any
case
have
depressed
his
spirits
he
did
not
know
the
face
of
death
and
a
merry
little
ruffian
of
a
terrier
he
was
ready
for
any
adventure
on
the
stone
gate
pillar
was
a
notice
in
plain
english
that
no
dogs
were
permitted
in
greyfriars
as
well
as
if
he
could
read
bobby
knew
that
the
kirkyard
was
forbidden
ground
he
had
learned
that
by
bitter
experience
once
when
the
little
wicket
gate
that
held
the
two
tall
leaves
ajar
by
day
chanced
to
be
open
he
had
joyously
chased
a
cat
across
the
graves
and
over
the
western
wall
onto
the
broad
green
lawn
of
heriot
hospital
there
the
little
dog
escapade
bred
other
mischief
for
hospital
was
not
a
hospital
at
all
in
the
modern
english
sense
of
being
a
refuge
for
the
sick
built
and
christened
in
a
day
when
a
stuart
king
reigned
in
holyrood
palace
and
french
was
spoken
in
the
scottish
court
heriot
was
a
splendid
pile
of
a
charity
school
all
towers
and
battlements
and
cheerful
color
and
countless
beautiful
windows
endowed
by
a
beruffed
and
doubleted
goldsmith
jinglin
geordie
heriot
who
had
nae
brave
laddie
o
his
ain
it
was
devoted
to
the
care
and
education
of
puir
orphan
an
faderless
there
it
had
stood
for
more
than
two
centuries
in
a
spacious
park
like
the
of
a
lowland
laird
but
hemmed
in
by
sordid
markets
and
swarming
slums
the
region
round
about
furnished
an
unfailing
supply
of
puir
orphan
an
faderless
boys
who
were
as
and
irresponsible
as
bobby
hundreds
of
the
heriot
laddies
were
out
in
the
noon
recess
playing
cricket
and
when
bobby
chased
that
unlucky
cat
over
the
kirkyard
wall
he
could
go
no
farther
himself
but
the
laddies
took
up
the
pursuit
yelling
like
highland
clans
of
old
in
a
foray
across
the
border
the
unholy
din
disturbed
the
sacred
peace
of
the
kirkyard
bobby
dashed
back
barking
furiously
in
pure
exuberance
of
spirits
he
tumbled
gaily
over
grassy
hummocks
frisked
saucily
around
terrifying
old
mausoleums
wriggled
under
the
most
enticing
of
table
tombs
and
sprawled
exhausted
but
still
happy
and
noisy
at
auld
jock
feet
it
was
a
scandalous
thing
to
happen
in
any
kirkyard
the
angry
caretaker
was
instantly
out
of
his
little
stone
lodge
by
the
gate
and
taking
auld
jock
sharply
to
task
for
bobby
misbehavior
the
pious
old
shepherd
shocked
himself
and
publicly
disgraced
stood
bonnet
in
hand
humbly
apologetic
seeing
that
his
master
was
getting
the
worst
of
it
bobby
rushed
into
the
fray
an
animated
little
muff
of
pluck
and
fury
and
nipped
the
caretaker
shins
there
was
a
howl
of
pain
and
a
maist
michty
word
that
made
the
ancient
tombs
stand
aghast
master
and
dog
were
hustled
outside
the
gate
and
into
a
rabble
of
jeering
slum
gamin
what
a
about
a
miserable
cat
to
bobby
there
was
no
logic
at
all
in
the
denouement
to
this
swift
exciting
drama
but
he
understood
auld
jock
shame
and
displeasure
perfectly
as
he
was
gay
and
clever
the
little
dog
took
his
punishment
meekly
and
he
remembered
it
thereafter
he
passed
the
kirk
yard
gate
decorously
if
he
saw
a
cat
that
needed
harrying
he
merely
licked
his
little
red
chops
the
outward
sign
of
a
desperate
and
a
true
sport
he
bore
no
malice
toward
the
caretaker
during
that
first
summer
of
his
life
bobby
learned
many
things
he
learned
that
he
might
chase
rabbits
squirrels
and
and
and
whaups
that
came
up
to
feed
in
plowed
fields
rats
and
mice
around
byre
and
dairy
were
legitimate
prey
but
he
learned
that
he
must
not
annoy
sheep
and
nor
cattle
horses
and
chickens
and
he
discovered
that
unless
he
hung
close
to
auld
jock
heels
his
freedom
was
in
danger
from
a
wee
lassie
who
adored
him
he
was
no
from
the
bairnie
soft
cosseting
he
aye
fled
to
auld
jock
and
the
rough
hospitality
of
the
sheep
fold
being
exact
opposites
in
temperaments
but
alike
in
tastes
bobby
and
auld
jock
were
inseparable
in
the
quiet
corner
of
traill
crowded
they
spent
the
one
idle
hour
of
the
week
together
happily
bobby
had
the
leavings
of
a
herring
or
haddie
for
a
rough
little
skye
will
eat
anything
from
smoked
fish
to
eggs
and
he
had
the
tidbit
of
a
farthing
bone
to
worry
at
his
leisure
auld
jock
smoked
his
cutty
pipe
gazed
at
the
fire
or
into
the
and
meditated
on
nothing
in
particular
in
some
strange
way
that
no
dog
could
understand
bobby
had
been
separated
from
auld
jock
that
november
morning
the
tenant
of
cauldbrae
farm
had
driven
the
cart
in
himself
and
that
was
unusual
immediately
he
had
driven
out
again
leaving
auld
jock
behind
and
that
was
quite
outside
bobby
brief
experience
of
life
beguiled
to
the
lofty
and
coveted
driver
seat
where
with
lolling
tongue
he
could
view
this
interesting
world
between
the
horse
ears
bobby
had
been
spirited
out
of
the
city
and
carried
all
the
way
down
and
up
to
the
hilltop
of
fairmilehead
it
could
not
occur
to
his
loyal
little
heart
that
this
treachery
was
planned
nor
stanch
little
democrat
that
he
was
that
the
farmer
was
really
his
owner
and
that
he
could
not
follow
a
humbler
master
of
his
own
choosing
he
might
have
been
carried
to
the
distant
farm
and
shut
safely
in
the
byre
with
the
cows
for
the
night
but
for
an
incautious
remark
of
the
farmer
with
the
first
scent
of
the
native
heather
the
horse
quickened
his
pace
and
at
sight
of
the
purple
slopes
of
the
pentlands
looming
homeward
a
fond
thought
at
the
back
of
the
man
mind
very
naturally
took
shape
in
speech
eh
bobby
the
wee
lassie
wull
be
at
the
tap
o
the
brae
to
race
ye
bobby
pricked
his
drop
ears
within
a
narrow
limit
and
concerning
familiar
things
the
understanding
of
human
speech
by
these
intelligent
little
terriers
is
very
truly
remarkable
at
mention
of
the
wee
lassie
he
looked
behind
for
his
rough
old
friend
and
unfailing
refuge
auld
jock
absence
discovered
bobby
promptly
dropped
from
the
seat
of
honor
and
from
the
cart
tail
sniffed
the
smoke
of
edinboro
town
and
faced
right
about
to
the
farmer
peremptory
call
he
returned
the
spicy
repartee
of
a
cheerful
bark
it
was
as
much
as
to
say
dinna
fash
yersel
i
ken
what
i
after
an
hour
hard
run
back
over
the
dipping
and
rising
country
road
and
a
long
quarter
circuit
of
the
city
bobby
found
the
winding
way
into
the
west
end
of
the
grassmarket
to
a
human
being
afoot
there
was
a
shorter
cut
but
the
little
dog
could
only
retrace
the
familiar
route
of
the
farm
carts
it
was
a
notable
feat
for
a
small
creature
whose
tufted
legs
were
not
more
than
six
inches
in
length
whose
thatch
of
long
hair
almost
swept
the
roadway
and
caught
at
every
burr
and
bramble
and
who
was
still
so
young
that
his
nose
could
not
be
said
to
be
educated
in
the
he
ran
here
and
there
through
the
crowd
hopefully
investigating
narrow
closes
that
were
mere
rifts
in
precipices
of
buildings
nosing
outside
stairs
doorways
stables
bridge
arches
standing
carts
and
even
boots
he
yelped
at
the
crash
of
the
gun
but
it
was
another
matter
altogether
that
set
his
little
heart
to
palpitating
with
alarm
it
was
the
and
where
was
auld
jock
ah
a
happy
thought
his
master
had
gone
to
dinner
a
human
friend
would
have
resented
the
idea
of
such
base
desertion
and
sulked
but
in
a
little
dog
heart
of
trust
there
is
no
room
for
suspicion
the
thought
simply
lent
wings
to
bobby
tired
feet
as
the
emptied
he
chased
at
the
heels
of
laggards
up
the
rise
of
candlemakers
row
and
straight
on
to
the
familiar
through
the
forest
of
table
and
chair
and
human
legs
he
made
his
way
to
the
back
to
find
a
soldier
from
the
castle
in
smart
red
coat
and
polished
boots
lounging
in
auld
jock
inglenook
bobby
stood
stock
still
for
a
shocked
instant
then
he
howled
dismally
and
bolted
for
the
door
john
traill
the
proprietor
standing
midway
in
shirtsleeves
and
white
apron
caught
the
flying
terrier
between
his
legs
and
gave
him
a
friendly
clap
on
the
side
did
you
come
by
your
ainsel
with
a
farthing
in
your
ear
to
buy
a
bone
bobby
whaur
auld
jock
a
fear
may
be
crowded
back
into
the
mind
and
stoutly
denied
so
long
as
it
is
not
named
at
the
good
landlord
very
natural
question
auld
jock
there
was
the
shape
of
the
little
dog
fear
that
he
had
lost
his
master
with
a
whimpering
cry
he
struggled
free
out
of
the
door
he
went
like
a
shot
he
tumbled
down
the
steep
curve
and
doubled
on
his
tracks
around
the
at
his
onslaught
the
sparrows
rose
like
brown
leaves
on
a
gust
of
wind
and
drifted
down
again
a
cold
mist
veiled
the
castle
heights
from
the
stone
crown
of
the
ancient
cathedral
of
giles
on
high
street
floated
the
melody
of
the
bluebells
of
no
day
was
too
bleak
for
mcleod
to
climb
the
shaking
ladder
in
the
windy
tower
and
play
the
music
bells
during
the
hour
that
edinburgh
dined
bobby
forgot
to
dine
that
day
first
in
his
distracted
search
and
then
in
his
joy
of
finding
his
master
for
all
at
once
in
the
very
strangest
place
in
the
very
strangest
way
bobby
came
upon
auld
jock
a
rat
scurrying
out
from
a
foul
and
narrow
passage
that
gave
to
the
rear
of
the
white
hart
inn
pointed
the
little
dog
to
a
nook
hitherto
undiscovered
by
his
curious
nose
hidden
away
between
the
noisy
tavern
and
the
grim
island
crag
was
the
old
pit
of
a
ruder
day
there
in
a
cart
abandoned
among
the
nameless
abominations
of
publichouse
refuse
auld
jock
lay
huddled
in
his
greatcoat
of
hodden
gray
and
his
plaid
on
a
bundle
of
clothing
tied
in
a
tartan
kerchief
for
a
pillow
he
lay
very
still
and
breathing
heavily
bobby
barked
as
if
he
would
burst
his
lungs
he
barked
so
long
so
loud
and
so
furiously
running
and
the
cart
and
under
it
and
yelping
at
every
turn
that
a
slatternly
scullery
maid
opened
a
door
and
angrily
bade
him
no
to
deave
folk
wi
auld
jock
she
did
not
see
at
all
in
the
murky
pit
or
if
she
saw
him
thought
him
some
drunken
foreign
sailor
from
leith
harbor
when
she
went
in
she
slammed
the
door
and
lighted
the
gas
whether
from
some
instinct
of
protection
of
his
helpless
master
in
that
foul
and
hostile
place
or
because
barking
had
proved
to
be
of
no
use
bobby
sat
back
on
his
haunches
and
considered
this
strange
disquieting
thing
it
was
not
like
auld
jock
to
sleep
in
the
daytime
or
so
soundly
at
any
time
that
barking
would
not
awaken
him
a
clever
and
resourceful
dog
bobby
crouched
back
against
the
farthest
wall
took
a
running
leap
to
the
top
of
the
low
boots
dug
his
claws
into
the
stout
home
knitted
stockings
and
scrambled
up
over
auld
jock
legs
into
the
cart
in
an
instant
he
poked
his
little
black
mop
of
a
wet
muzzle
into
his
face
and
barked
once
sharply
in
his
ear
to
bobby
delight
auld
jock
sat
up
and
blinked
his
eyes
the
old
eyes
were
brighter
the
grizzled
face
redder
than
was
natural
but
such
matters
were
quite
outside
of
the
little
dog
ken
it
was
a
dazed
moment
before
the
man
remembered
that
bobby
should
not
be
there
he
frowned
down
at
the
excited
little
creature
who
was
wagging
satisfaction
from
his
to
the
end
of
his
crested
tail
in
a
puzzled
effort
to
remember
why
eh
bobby
his
tone
was
one
of
vague
reproof
nae
doot
ye
fair
satisfied
wi
yer
bobby
feathered
tail
drooped
but
it
still
quivered
all
ready
to
wag
again
at
the
slightest
encouragement
auld
jock
stared
at
him
stupidly
his
dizzy
head
in
his
hands
a
very
tired
very
draggled
little
dog
bobby
dropped
beside
his
master
panting
subdued
by
the
reproach
but
happy
his
soft
eyes
veiled
by
the
silvery
fringe
that
fell
from
his
high
forehead
were
deep
brown
pools
of
affection
auld
jock
forgot
by
and
by
that
bobby
should
not
be
there
and
felt
only
the
comfort
of
his
companionship
weel
bobby
he
began
again
uncertainly
and
then
because
his
scotch
peasant
reticence
had
been
quite
broken
down
by
bobby
shameless
devotion
so
that
he
told
the
little
dog
many
things
that
he
cannily
concealed
from
human
kind
he
confided
the
strange
weakness
and
dizziness
in
the
head
that
had
overtaken
him
auld
jock
is
juist
fair
silly
the
day
bonny
wee
down
came
a
shaking
hot
old
hand
in
a
rough
caress
and
up
a
gallant
young
tail
to
wave
like
a
banner
all
was
right
with
the
little
world
again
but
it
was
plain
even
to
bobby
that
something
had
gone
wrong
with
auld
jock
it
was
the
man
who
wore
the
air
of
a
culprit
a
scotch
laborer
does
not
lightly
confess
to
feeling
fair
silly
nor
sleep
away
the
busy
hours
of
daylight
the
old
man
was
puzzled
and
humiliated
by
this
discreditable
thing
a
human
friend
would
have
understood
his
plight
led
the
fevered
man
out
of
that
bleak
and
fetid
tucked
him
into
a
warm
bed
comforted
him
with
a
hot
drink
and
then
gone
swiftly
for
skilled
help
bobby
knew
only
that
his
master
had
unusual
need
of
love
very
very
early
a
dog
learns
that
life
is
not
as
simple
a
matter
to
his
master
as
it
is
to
himself
there
are
times
when
he
reads
trouble
that
he
can
not
help
or
understand
in
the
man
eye
and
voice
then
he
can
only
look
his
love
and
loyalty
wistfully
as
if
he
felt
his
own
shortcoming
in
the
matter
of
speech
and
if
the
trouble
is
so
great
that
the
master
forgets
to
eat
his
dinner
forgets
also
the
needs
of
his
faithful
little
friend
it
is
the
dog
dear
privilege
to
bear
neglect
and
hunger
without
complaint
therefore
when
auld
jock
lay
down
again
and
sank
almost
at
once
into
sodden
sleep
bobby
snuggled
in
the
hollow
of
his
master
arm
and
nuzzled
his
nose
in
his
master
neck
ii
while
the
bells
played
there
grows
a
bonny
briarbush
in
our
kale
yard
auld
jock
and
bobby
slept
they
slept
while
the
tavern
emptied
itself
of
noisy
guests
and
clattering
crockery
was
washed
at
the
dingy
windows
that
overlooked
the
cockpit
they
slept
while
the
cold
fell
with
the
falling
day
and
the
mist
was
whipped
into
driving
rain
almost
a
cave
between
shelving
rock
and
house
wall
a
gust
of
wind
still
found
its
way
in
now
and
then
at
a
splash
of
rain
auld
jock
stirred
uneasily
in
his
sleep
bobby
merely
sniffed
the
freshened
air
with
pleasure
and
curled
himself
up
for
another
nap
no
rain
could
wet
bobby
under
his
rough
outer
coat
that
was
parted
along
the
back
as
neatly
as
the
thatch
along
a
cottage
was
a
dense
woolly
fleece
that
defied
wind
and
rain
snow
and
sleet
to
penetrate
he
could
not
know
that
nature
had
not
been
as
generous
in
protecting
his
master
against
the
weather
although
of
a
subarctic
breed
fitted
to
live
shelterless
if
need
be
and
to
earn
his
living
by
native
wit
bobby
had
the
beauty
the
grace
and
the
charming
manners
of
a
lady
pet
in
a
litter
of
puppies
bobby
was
a
it
is
said
that
some
of
the
ships
of
the
spanish
armada
with
french
poodles
in
the
officers
cabins
were
blown
far
north
and
west
and
broken
up
on
the
icy
coasts
of
the
hebrides
and
skye
some
such
crossing
of
his
ancestry
it
would
seem
had
given
a
greater
length
and
a
crisp
wave
to
bobby
outer
coat
dropped
and
silkily
fringed
his
ears
and
powdered
his
useful
color
with
silver
frost
but
he
had
the
hardiness
and
intelligence
of
the
sturdier
breed
and
the
instinct
of
devotion
to
the
working
master
so
he
had
turned
from
a
bit
lassie
of
a
mistress
and
the
cozy
chimney
corner
of
the
kitchen
and
linked
his
fortunes
with
this
forlorn
old
laborer
a
grizzled
gnarled
little
man
was
auld
jock
of
tough
fiber
but
worn
out
at
last
by
fifty
winters
as
a
shepherd
on
the
bleak
hills
of
midlothian
and
fife
and
a
dozen
more
in
the
low
stables
and
garrets
of
edinburgh
he
had
come
into
the
world
unnoted
in
a
shepherd
lonely
cot
with
little
wit
of
mind
or
skill
of
hand
he
had
been
a
common
tool
used
by
this
master
and
that
for
the
roughest
tasks
when
needed
put
aside
passed
on
and
dropped
out
of
mind
nothing
ever
belonged
to
the
man
but
his
scant
earnings
wifeless
cotless
bairnless
he
had
slept
since
early
boyhood
under
strange
roofs
eaten
the
bread
of
the
hireling
and
sat
dumb
at
other
firesides
if
he
had
another
name
it
had
been
forgotten
in
youth
he
was
jock
in
age
auld
jock
in
his
summer
there
was
a
belated
blooming
in
auld
soul
out
of
some
miraculous
caprice
bobby
lavished
on
him
a
riotous
affection
then
up
out
of
the
man
subconscious
memory
came
words
learned
from
the
lips
of
a
mother
they
were
words
not
meant
for
little
dogs
at
all
but
for
sweetheart
wife
and
bairn
auld
jock
used
them
cautiously
fearing
to
be
overheard
for
the
matter
was
a
subject
of
wonder
and
rough
jest
at
the
farm
he
used
them
when
bobby
followed
him
at
the
or
scampered
over
the
heather
with
him
behind
the
flocks
he
used
them
on
the
journeyings
and
on
summer
nights
when
the
sea
wind
came
sweetly
from
the
broad
firth
and
the
two
slept
like
vagabonds
on
a
haycock
under
the
stars
the
purest
pleasure
auld
jock
ever
knew
was
the
taking
of
a
bright
farthing
from
his
pocket
to
pay
for
bobby
delectable
bone
in
traill
place
given
what
was
due
him
that
morning
and
dismissed
for
the
season
to
find
such
work
as
he
could
in
the
city
auld
jock
did
not
question
the
farmer
right
to
take
bobby
back
besides
what
could
he
do
with
the
noisy
little
rascal
in
an
edinburgh
lodging
but
duller
of
wit
than
usual
feeling
very
old
and
lonely
and
shaky
on
his
legs
and
dizzy
in
his
head
auld
jock
parted
with
bobby
and
with
his
courage
together
with
the
instinct
of
the
dumb
animal
that
suffers
he
stumbled
into
the
foul
nook
and
fell
almost
at
once
into
a
heavy
sleep
out
of
that
bobby
roused
him
but
briefly
long
before
his
master
awoke
bobby
finished
his
series
of
refreshing
little
naps
sat
up
yawned
stretched
his
short
shaggy
legs
sniffed
at
auld
jock
experimentally
and
trotted
around
the
bed
of
the
cart
on
a
tour
of
investigation
this
proving
to
be
of
small
interest
and
no
profit
he
lay
down
again
beside
his
master
nose
on
paws
and
waited
auld
jock
pleasure
patiently
a
sweep
of
drenching
rain
brought
the
old
man
suddenly
to
his
feet
and
stumbling
into
the
market
place
the
alert
little
dog
tumbled
about
him
barking
ecstatically
the
fever
was
gone
and
auld
jock
head
quite
clear
but
in
its
place
was
a
weakness
an
aching
of
the
limbs
a
weight
on
the
chest
and
a
great
shivering
although
the
bell
of
giles
was
just
striking
the
hour
of
five
it
was
already
entirely
dark
a
with
ladder
and
torch
was
setting
a
double
line
of
gas
jets
to
flaring
along
the
lofty
parapets
of
the
bridge
if
the
grassmarket
was
a
quarry
pit
by
day
on
a
night
of
storm
it
was
the
bottom
of
a
reservoir
the
height
of
the
walls
was
marked
by
a
luminous
crown
from
many
lights
above
the
castle
head
and
by
a
student
dim
candle
here
and
there
at
a
garret
window
the
huge
bulk
of
the
bridge
cast
a
shadow
velvet
black
across
the
eastern
half
of
the
market
had
not
bobby
gone
before
and
barked
and
run
back
again
and
again
and
jumped
up
on
auld
jock
legs
the
man
might
never
have
won
his
way
across
the
drowned
place
in
the
inky
blackness
and
against
the
slanted
blast
of
icy
rain
when
he
gained
the
foot
of
candlemakers
row
a
crescent
of
tall
old
houses
that
curved
upward
around
the
lower
end
of
greyfriars
kirkyard
water
poured
upon
him
from
the
heavy
timbered
gallery
of
the
cunzie
neuk
once
the
royal
mint
the
carting
office
that
occupied
the
street
floor
was
closed
or
auld
jock
would
have
sought
shelter
there
he
struggled
up
the
rise
made
slippery
by
rain
and
grime
then
as
the
street
turned
southward
in
its
easy
curve
there
was
some
shelter
from
the
house
walls
but
auld
jock
was
quite
exhausted
and
incapable
of
caring
for
himself
in
the
ancient
guildhall
of
the
candlemakers
at
the
top
of
the
row
was
another
carting
office
and
harrow
inn
a
resort
of
country
carriers
the
man
would
have
gone
in
there
where
he
was
quite
unknown
or
indeed
he
might
even
have
lain
down
in
the
bleak
court
that
gave
access
to
the
tenements
above
but
for
bobby
persistent
and
cheerful
barking
begging
and
nipping
maister
maister
he
said
as
plainly
as
a
little
dog
could
speak
dinna
bide
here
it
juist
a
stap
or
two
to
food
an
fire
in
the
cozy
auld
and
then
the
level
roadway
won
at
last
there
was
the
railing
of
the
to
cling
to
on
the
one
hand
and
the
upright
bars
of
the
kirkyard
gate
on
the
other
by
the
help
of
these
and
the
urging
of
wee
bobby
auld
jock
came
the
short
steep
way
up
out
of
the
market
to
the
row
of
lighted
shops
in
greyfriars
place
with
the
wind
at
the
back
and
above
the
housetops
traill
stood
in
a
dry
haven
of
peace
in
his
doorway
firelight
behind
him
and
welcome
in
his
shrewd
gray
eyes
if
auld
jock
had
shown
any
intention
of
going
by
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
landlord
of
ye
olde
greyfriars
might
have
dragged
him
in
bodily
the
storm
had
driven
all
his
customers
home
for
an
hour
there
had
not
been
a
soul
in
the
place
to
speak
to
and
it
was
so
entirely
necessary
for
john
traill
to
hear
his
own
voice
that
he
had
been
known
in
such
straits
to
talk
to
himself
auld
jock
was
not
an
inspiring
auditor
but
a
deal
better
than
naething
and
if
he
proved
hopeless
entertainment
was
to
be
found
in
bobby
so
traill
bustled
in
before
his
guests
poked
the
open
fire
into
leaping
flames
and
heaped
it
up
skillfully
at
the
back
with
fresh
coals
the
good
landlord
turned
from
his
hospitable
task
to
find
auld
jock
streaming
and
shaking
on
the
hearth
man
but
you
wet
he
exclaimed
he
hustled
the
old
shepherd
out
of
his
dripping
plaid
and
greatcoat
and
spread
them
to
the
blaze
auld
jock
found
a
dry
knitted
bonnet
in
his
little
bundle
and
set
it
on
his
head
it
was
a
moment
or
two
before
he
could
speak
without
the
humiliating
betrayal
of
chattering
teeth
ay
it
a
misty
nicht
he
admitted
with
caution
misty
man
it
raining
like
all
the
seven
deils
were
having
delivered
himself
of
this
violent
opinion
traill
fell
into
his
usual
philosophic
vein
i
have
sma
patience
with
the
scotch
way
of
making
little
of
everything
if
noah
had
been
a
lowland
scot
he
said
the
deluge
was
juist
fair
he
laughed
at
his
own
wit
his
face
and
keen
gray
eyes
lighting
up
to
a
kindliness
that
his
brusque
speech
denied
in
vain
he
had
a
fluency
of
good
english
at
command
that
he
would
have
thought
ostentatious
to
use
in
speaking
with
a
simple
country
body
auld
jock
stared
at
traill
and
pondered
the
matter
by
and
by
he
asked
wasna
the
deluge
fair
wet
the
landlord
sighed
but
brought
to
book
like
that
admitted
that
it
was
conversation
flagged
however
while
he
busied
himself
with
toasting
a
smoked
herring
and
dragging
roasted
potatoes
from
the
little
iron
oven
that
was
fitted
into
the
brickwork
of
the
fireplace
beside
the
grate
bobby
was
attending
to
his
own
entertainment
the
familiar
place
wore
a
new
and
enchanting
aspect
and
needed
instant
exploration
by
day
it
was
fitted
with
tables
picketed
by
chairs
and
all
manner
of
boots
noisy
and
crowded
a
little
dog
that
wandered
about
there
was
liable
to
be
trodden
upon
on
that
night
of
storm
it
was
a
vast
bright
place
so
silent
one
could
hear
the
ticking
of
the
clock
the
crisp
crackling
of
the
flames
and
the
snapping
of
the
coals
the
uncovered
deal
tables
were
set
back
in
a
double
line
along
one
wall
with
the
chairs
piled
on
top
leaving
a
wide
passage
of
freshly
scrubbed
and
sanded
oaken
floor
from
the
door
to
the
fireplace
firelight
danced
on
the
dark
old
wainscoting
and
high
carved
overmantel
winked
on
rows
of
drinking
mugs
and
metal
covers
over
cold
meats
on
the
buffet
and
even
picked
out
the
gilt
titles
on
the
backs
of
a
shelf
of
books
in
traill
private
corner
behind
the
bar
bobby
shook
himself
on
the
hearth
to
free
his
of
surplus
water
to
the
landlord
dry
we
no
needing
a
shower
in
the
house
lie
down
bobby
he
wagged
his
tail
politely
as
a
sign
that
he
heard
but
as
auld
jock
did
not
repeat
the
order
he
ignored
it
and
scampered
busily
about
the
room
leaving
little
trails
of
wet
behind
him
this
of
traill
place
was
more
like
the
parlor
of
a
country
inn
or
a
kitchen
if
there
had
been
a
bed
or
two
than
a
restaurant
in
the
city
there
a
humble
man
might
see
his
herring
toasted
his
bannocks
baked
on
the
or
his
tea
brewed
to
his
liking
on
such
a
night
as
this
the
landlord
would
pull
the
settle
out
of
the
inglenook
to
the
hearth
set
before
the
solitary
guest
a
small
table
and
keep
the
kettle
on
the
hob
spread
yoursel
on
both
sides
o
the
fire
man
there
be
nane
to
keep
us
company
i
thinking
ilka
man
that
has
a
roof
o
his
ain
will
be
wearing
it
for
a
bonnet
the
as
there
was
no
answer
to
this
the
skilled
conversational
angler
dropped
a
bit
of
bait
that
the
wariest
man
must
rise
to
that
a
vera
intelligent
bit
dog
auld
jock
he
was
here
with
the
spiering
for
you
when
he
didna
find
you
he
greeted
like
a
auld
jock
huddled
in
the
corner
of
the
settle
so
near
the
fire
that
his
jacket
smoked
took
so
long
a
time
to
find
an
answer
that
traill
looked
at
him
keenly
as
he
set
the
wooden
plate
and
pewter
mug
on
the
table
man
you
vera
ill
he
cried
sharply
in
truth
he
was
shocked
and
because
he
had
not
observed
auld
jock
condition
before
i
no
so
awfu
ill
came
back
in
irritated
denial
as
if
he
had
been
accused
of
some
misbehavior
weel
it
no
a
dry
herrin
ye
hae
in
my
shop
the
nicht

a
hot
mutton
broo
wi
porridge
in
it
an
bits
o
meat
to
tak
the
cauld
oot
o
yer
auld
and
there
the
plate
was
whisked
away
and
the
cover
lifted
from
a
bubbling
pot
and
the
kettle
was
over
the
fire
for
the
brewing
of
tea
at
a
peremptory
order
the
soaked
boots
and
stockings
were
off
and
dry
socks
found
in
the
kerchief
bundle
auld
jock
was
used
to
taking
orders
from
his
superiors
and
offered
no
resistance
to
being
hustled
after
this
manner
into
warmth
and
good
cheer
besides
who
could
have
withstood
that
flood
of
homely
speech
on
which
the
good
landlord
came
right
down
to
the
old
shepherd
humble
level
such
warm
feeling
was
established
that
traill
quite
forgot
his
usual
caution
and
certain
prejudices
of
old
country
bodies
noo
he
said
cheerfully
as
he
set
the
hot
broth
on
the
table
ye
maun
juist
hae
a
a
doctor
is
the
last
resort
of
the
unlettered
poor
the
very
threat
of
one
to
the
scotch
peasant
of
a
ago
was
a
sentence
of
death
auld
jock
blanched
and
he
shook
so
that
he
dropped
his
spoon
traill
hastened
to
undo
the
mischief
it
no
a

be
needing

juist
for

that

for

ye
a

ane
said
auld
jock
it
was
a
terrible
word
saft
john
traill
flushed
darkly
and
relapsed
into
discouraged
silence
deep
down
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
a
regiment
of
soldiers
from
the
castle
could
not
take
him
alive
a
free
patient
into
the
infirmary
but
what
was
one
to
do
but
lee
right
heartily
for
the
good
of
this
very
sick
very
poor
homeless
old
man
on
a
night
of
pitiless
storm
that
he
had
lee
to
no
purpose
and
got
a
saft
name
for
it
was
a
blow
to
his
pride
hearing
the
clatter
of
fork
and
spoon
bobby
trotted
from
behind
the
bar
and
saved
the
day
of
discomfiture
time
for
dinner
indeed
up
he
came
on
his
hind
legs
and
politely
begged
his
master
for
food
it
was
the
prettiest
thing
he
could
do
and
the
landlord
delighted
in
him
gie
a
penny
plate
o
the
gude
broo
said
auld
jock
and
he
took
the
copper
coin
from
his
pocket
to
pay
for
it
he
forgot
his
own
meal
in
watching
the
hungry
little
creature
eat
warmed
and
softened
by
traill
kindness
and
by
the
heartening
food
auld
jock
betrayed
a
thought
that
had
rankled
in
the
depths
of
his
mind
all
day
bobby
isna
ma
ain
his
voice
was
dull
and
unhappy
ah
here
was
misery
deeper
than
any
physical
ill
the
penny
was
his
a
senseless
thing
but
poor
old
sick
hameless
and
kinless
the
little
dog
that
loved
and
followed
him
wasna
his
to
hide
the
huskiness
in
his
own
voice
traill
relapsed
into
broad
burry
scotch
dinna
fash
yersel
man
the
wee
beastie
is
maist
michty
fond
o
ye
an
ilka
dog
aye
chooses
ain
auld
jock
shook
his
head
and
gave
a
brief
account
of
bobby
perversity
on
the
very
next
the
little
dog
must
be
restored
to
the
tenant
of
cauldbrae
farm
and
if
necessary
tied
in
the
cart
it
was
unlikely
young
as
he
was
that
he
would
try
to
find
his
way
back
all
the
way
from
near
the
top
of
the
pentlands
in
a
day
or
two
he
would
forget
auld
jock
i
canna
say
it
wullna
be
sair
partin
and
then
seeing
the
sympathy
in
the
landlord
eye
and
fearing
a
disgraceful
breakdown
auld
jock
checked
his
self
betrayal
during
the
talk
bobby
stood
listening
at
the
abrupt
ending
he
put
his
shagged
paws
up
on
auld
jock
knee
wistfully
inquiring
about
this
emotional
matter
then
he
dropped
soberly
and
slunk
away
under
his
master
chair
ay
he
kens
we
talkin
aboot
he
a
knowing
bit

have
you
attended
to
his
sairous
education
man
nae

ower
young
is
aye
the
time
to
teach
a
dog
or
a

for
the
wee
lassie
wha
fair

o
auld
jock
answered
briefly
this
was
a
strange
sentiment
from
the
old
man
who
for
himself
would
have
held
ornamental
idleness
sinful
he
finished
his
supper
in
brooding
silence
at
last
he
broke
out
in
a
peevish
irritation
that
only
made
his
grief
at
parting
with
bobby
more
apparent
to
an
understanding
man
like
traill
i
dinna
ken
what
to

aboot

traill
eyes
sparkled
at
recollection
of
an
apt
literary
story
to
which
john
brown
had
given
currency
like
many
edinburgh
shopkeepers
traill
was
a
man
of
superior
education
and
an
omnivorous
reader
and
he
had
many
customers
from
the
university
to
give
him
a
fund
of
stories
of
scotch
writers
and
other
worthies
you
have
a
double
plaid
man
ay
ilka
shepherd
got
a
it
seemed
a
foolish
question
to
auld
jock
but
traill
went
on
blithely
there
a
pocket
in
the
plaid
ane
end
left
open
at
the
side
to
mak
a
pouch
nae
doubt
you
carried
mony
a
thing
in
that
pouch
nae
no
so
mony
juist
the
weel
sir
walter
had
a
shepherd
plaid
and
there
was
a
bit
lassie
he
was
vera
fond
of
syne
when
he
had
been
at
the
writing
a
the
day
and
was
aff
his
heid
like
with
too
mony
thoughts
he
go
across
the
town
and
fetch
the
bairnie
to
keep
him
company
she
was
a
lassie
sax
or
seven
years
auld
and
sma
of
her
age
but
no
half
as
sma
as
bobby
i
he
stopped
to
let
this
significant
comparison
sink
into
auld
jock
mind
the
lassie
had
nae
liking
for
the
unmannerly
wind
and
snaw
of
edinburgh
so
sir
walter
just
happed
her
in
the
pouch
of
his
plaid
and
tumbled
her
out
snug
as
a
lamb
and
nane
the
wiser
in
the
big
room
wha
walls
were
lined
with
auld
jock
betrayed
not
a
glimmer
of
intelligence
as
to
the
personal
bearing
of
the
story
but
he
showed
polite
interest
i
ken
aboot
sir
walter
or
ony
o
the
grand
traill
sighed
cleared
the
table
in
silence
and
mended
the
fire
it
was
ill
having
no
one
to
talk
to
but
a
simple
old
body
who
could
put
two
and
two
together
and
make
four
the
landlord
lighted
his
pipe
meditatively
and
he
lighted
his
cruisey
lamp
for
reading
auld
jock
was
dry
and
warm
again
oh
very
very
warm
so
that
he
presently
fell
into
a
doze
the
was
so
compassed
on
all
sides
but
the
front
by
neighboring
house
and
kirkyard
wall
and
by
the
floors
above
that
only
a
murmur
of
the
storm
penetrated
it
it
was
so
quiet
indeed
that
a
tiny
scratching
sound
in
a
distant
corner
was
heard
distinctly
a
streak
of
dark
silver
as
of
animated
mercury
bobby
flashed
past
a
scuffle
a
squeak
and
he
was
back
again
dropping
a
big
rat
at
the
landlord
feet
and
wagging
his
tail
with
pride
weel
done
bobby
there
a
bite
and
a
bone
for
you
here
ony
time
o
day
you
call
for
it
ay
a
sensible
bit
dog
will
attend
to
his
ain
education
and
mak
himsel
traill
felt
a
sudden
access
of
warm
liking
for
the
attractive
little
scrap
of
knowingness
and
pluck
he
patted
the
tousled
head
but
bobby
backed
away
he
had
no
mind
to
be
caressed
by
any
man
beside
his
master
after
a
moment
the
landlord
took
guy
mannering
down
from
the
knowing
his
waverley
by
heart
he
turned
at
once
to
the
passages
about
dandie
dinmont
and
his
terriers
mustard
and
pepper
and
other
spicy
wee
rascals
ay
terriers
are
sonsie
leal
dogs
auld
jock
will
have
ane
true
mourner
at
his
funeral
i
would
no
mind
if
on
impulse
he
got
up
and
dropped
a
couple
of
hard
scotch
buns
very
good
indeed
into
the
pocket
of
auld
jock
greatcoat
for
bobby
the
old
man
might
not
be
able
to
be
out
the
morn
with
the
thought
in
his
mind
that
some
one
should
keep
a
friendly
eye
on
the
man
he
mended
the
fire
with
such
an
unnecessary
clattering
of
the
tongs
that
auld
jock
started
from
his
sleep
with
a
cry
whaur
is
it
you
have
your
lodging
jock
the
landlord
asked
sharply
for
the
man
looked
so
dazed
that
his
understanding
was
not
to
be
reached
easily
he
got
the
indefinite
information
that
it
was
at
the
top
of
one
of
the
tall
old
tenements
juist
aff
the
a
lang
climb
for
an
auld
man
john
traill
said
compassionately
then
optimistic
as
usual
but
it
a
lang
climb
or
a
foul
smell
in
the
poor
quarters
of
ay
it
weel
aboon
the
fou
with
some
comforting
thought
that
he
did
not
confide
to
traill
but
that
ironed
lines
out
of
his
old
face
auld
jock
went
to
sleep
again
well
the
landlord
reflected
he
could
remain
there
by
the
fire
until
the
closing
hour
or
later
if
need
be
and
by
that
time
the
storm
might
ease
a
bit
so
that
he
could
get
to
his
lodging
without
another
wetting
for
an
hour
the
place
was
silent
except
for
the
falling
clinkers
from
the
grate
the
rustling
of
and
the
plumping
of
rain
on
the
windows
when
the
wind
shifted
a
point
lost
in
the
romance
traill
took
no
note
of
the
passing
time
or
of
his
quiet
guests
until
he
felt
a
little
tug
at
his
eh
laddie
he
questioned
up
the
little
dog
rose
in
the
begging
attitude
then
with
a
sharp
bark
he
dashed
back
to
his
master
something
was
very
wrong
indeed
auld
jock
had
sunk
down
in
his
seat
his
arms
hung
helplessly
over
the
end
and
back
of
the
settle
and
his
legs
were
sprawled
limply
before
him
the
bonnet
that
he
always
wore
outdoors
and
in
had
fallen
from
his
scant
gray
locks
and
his
head
had
dropped
forward
on
his
chest
his
breathing
was
labored
and
he
muttered
in
his
sleep
in
a
moment
traill
was
inside
his
own
greatcoat
storm
boots
and
bonnet
at
the
door
he
turned
back
the
shop
was
unguarded
although
greyfriars
place
lay
on
the
hilltop
with
the
sanctuary
of
the
kirkyard
behind
it
and
the
university
at
no
great
distance
in
front
it
was
but
a
step
up
from
the
gorge
of
the
cowgate
the
landlord
locked
his
moneydrawer
pushed
his
against
it
and
roused
auld
jock
so
far
as
to
move
him
over
from
the
settle
the
chief
responsibility
he
laid
on
the
anxious
little
dog
that
watched
his
every
movement
lie
down
bobby
and
mind
auld
jock
and
you
no
a
gude
dog
if
you
canna
bark
to
waken
the
dead
in
the
kirkyard
if
ony
strange
body
comes
whaur
are
ye
gangin
cried
auld
jock
he
was
wide
awake
with
burning
suspicious
eyes
fixed
on
his
host
sit
you
down
man
with
your
back
to
my
siller
i
going
for
a
the
noise
of
the
storm
as
he
opened
the
door
prevented
his
hearing
the
frightened
protest
dinna
ging
the
rain
had
turned
to
sleet
and
traill
had
trouble
in
keeping
his
feet
he
looked
first
into
the
famous
book
hunter
stall
next
door
on
the
chance
of
finding
a
medical
student
the
place
was
open
but
it
had
no
customers
he
went
on
to
the
bridge
but
there
the
sheriff
court
the
martyr
church
the
society
halls
and
all
the
smart
shops
were
closed
their
dark
fronts
lighted
fitfully
by
flaring
the
bitter
night
had
driven
all
edinburgh
to
private
cover
from
the
rear
came
a
clear
whistle
some
heriot
laddie
who
being
not
entirely
a
puir
orphan
but
only
faderless
and
therefore
living
outside
the
school
with
his
mother
had
been
kept
after
nightfall
because
of
lessons
or
misbehavior
traill
turned
passed
his
own
door
and
went
on
southward
into
forest
road
that
skirted
the
long
arm
of
the
kirkyard
from
the
burghmuir
all
the
way
to
the
grassmarket
and
the
cowgate
was
downhill
so
with
arms
winged
and
stout
legs
spread
wide
and
braced
geordie
ross
was
sliding
gaily
homeward
his
knitted
tippet
a
gallant
pennant
behind
here
was
a
mercury
for
an
urgent
errand
laddie
do

off
with
speed
across
the
bridge
to
high
street
traill
struggled
back
to
his
shop
against
wind
and
treacherous
ice
thinking
what
kind
of
a
bed
might
be
contrived
for
the
sick
man
for
the
night
in
the
morning
the
daft
auld
body
could
be
hurried
to
a
bed
in
the
infirmary
as
for
wee
bobby
he
would
mind
if
and
there
he
ran
into
his
own
door
a
gale
blew
through
the
hastily
deserted
place
ashes
were
scattered
about
the
hearth
and
the
cruisey
lamp
flared
in
the
gusts
auld
jock
and
bobby
were
gone
iii
although
dismayed
and
for
having
frightened
auld
jock
into
taking
flight
by
his
incautious
talk
of
a
doctor
not
for
an
instant
did
the
landlord
of
greyfriars
entertain
the
idea
of
following
him
the
old
man
had
only
to
cross
the
street
and
drop
down
the
incline
between
the
bridge
approach
and
the
ancient
chapel
of
magdalen
to
be
lost
in
the
deepest
most
densely
peopled
and
blackest
gorge
in
christendom
well
knowing
that
he
was
safe
from
pursuit
auld
jock
chuckled
as
he
gained
the
last
low
level
fever
lent
him
a
brief
strength
and
the
cold
damp
was
grateful
to
his
hot
skin
none
were
abroad
in
the
cowgate
and
that
was
lucky
for
in
this
black
hole
of
edinburgh
even
so
old
and
poor
a
man
was
liable
to
be
set
upon
by
thieves
on
the
chance
of
a
few
shillings
or
pence
used
as
he
was
to
following
flocks
up
treacherous
braes
and
through
drifted
glens
and
surefooted
as
a
collie
auld
jock
had
to
pick
his
way
carefully
over
the
slimy
cobble
stones
of
the
cowgate
he
could
see
nothing
the
scattered
blurred
by
the
wet
only
made
a
timbered
gallery
or
stone
stairs
stand
out
here
and
there
or
lighted
up
a
gothic
gargoyle
to
a
fantastic
grin
the
street
lay
so
deep
and
narrow
that
sleet
and
wind
wasted
little
time
in
finding
it
out
but
roared
and
rattled
among
the
gables
dormers
and
overhead
happy
in
finding
his
master
himself
again
and
sniffing
fresh
adventure
bobby
tumbled
noisily
about
auld
jock
feet
until
reproved
and
here
was
strange
going
ancient
and
warring
smells
confused
and
insulted
the
little
country
dog
nose
after
a
few
inquiring
and
protesting
barks
bobby
fell
into
a
subdued
trot
at
auld
jock
heels
to
this
shepherd
in
exile
the
romance
of
old
edinburgh
was
a
sealed
book
it
was
indeed
difficult
for
the
most
imaginative
to
believe
that
the
cowgate
was
once
a
lovely
wooded
ravine
with
a
rustic
burn
babbling
over
pebbles
at
its
bottom
and
along
the
brook
a
straggling
path
worn
smooth
by
cattle
on
their
driven
way
to
the
grassmarket
then
when
the
scottish
nobility
was
crowded
out
of
the
mansions
on
the
sloping
ridge
of
high
street
that
ran
the
mile
from
the
castle
to
holyrood
palace
splendor
camped
in
the
cowgate
in
villas
set
in
fair
gardens
and
separated
by
in
which
birds
nested
in
time
this
ravine
too
became
overbuilt
houses
tumbled
down
both
slopes
to
the
winding
cattle
path
and
the
burn
was
arched
over
to
make
a
thoroughfare
laterally
the
buildings
were
crowded
together
until
the
upper
floors
were
pushed
out
on
timber
brackets
for
light
and
air
galleries
stairs
and
jutting
windows
were
added
to
outer
walls
and
the
mansions
climbed
story
above
story
until
the
cowgate
was
an
undercut
canon
such
as
is
worn
through
rock
by
the
rivers
of
western
america
lairds
and
leddies
powdered
jeweled
and
were
borne
in
sedan
chairs
down
ten
flights
of
stone
stairs
and
through
courts
and
tunnel
streets
to
routs
in
castle
or
palace
and
to
tourneys
in
the
grassmarket
from
its
low
situation
the
cowgate
came
in
the
course
of
time
to
smell
to
heaven
and
out
of
it
was
a
sudden
exodus
of
grand
folk
to
the
northern
hills
the
lowest
level
was
given
over
at
once
to
the
poor
and
to
small
trade
the
wynds
and
closes
that
climbed
the
southern
slope
were
eagerly
possessed
by
divines
lawyers
and
literary
men
because
of
their
nearness
to
the
university
long
before
bobby
day
the
had
fled
from
the
cowgate
wynds
to
the
hilltop
streets
and
open
squares
about
the
colleges
a
few
decent
remained
in
the
decaying
houses
some
of
which
were
at
least
three
centuries
old
but
there
swarmed
in
upon
and
submerged
them
thousands
of
criminals
beggars
and
the
miserably
poor
and
degraded
of
many
nationalities
businesses
that
fatten
on
misfortune
the
saloon
pawn
old
clothes
and
cheap
food
the
squalid
cowgate
palaces
were
cut
up
into
honeycombs
of
tall
tenements
every
stair
was
a
crowded
highway
every
passage
a
place
of
deposit
for
filth
almost
every
room
sheltered
a
half
famished
family
in
darkness
and
ancient
dirt
grand
and
great
pious
and
wise
decent
wretched
and
terrible
folk
of
every
sort
had
preceded
auld
jock
to
his
lodging
in
a
steep
and
narrow
wynd
and
nine
gusty
flights
up
under
a
beautiful
old
gothic
gable
a
lantern
hanging
in
an
arched
opening
lighted
the
entrance
to
the
wynd
with
a
hand
outstretched
to
either
wall
auld
jock
felt
his
way
up
another
lantern
marked
a
sculptured
doorway
that
gave
to
the
foul
court
of
the
tenement
no
sky
could
be
seen
above
the
open
well
of
the
court
and
the
carved
oaken
banister
of
the
stairs
had
to
be
felt
for
and
clung
to
by
one
so
short
of
breath
on
the
seventh
landing
from
the
exertion
of
the
long
climb
auld
jock
was
shaken
into
helplessness
and
his
heart
set
to
pounding
by
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
overhead
a
shutter
was
slammed
back
and
an
angry
voice
bade
him
stop
deaving
the
last
two
flights
ascended
within
the
walls
the
old
man
stumbled
into
the
stifling
passage
and
sat
down
on
the
lowest
step
to
rest
on
the
landing
above
he
must
encounter
the
auld
wifie
of
a
landlady
rousing
her
it
might
be
and
none
too
from
sleep
unaware
that
he
added
to
his
master
difficulties
bobby
leaped
upon
him
and
licked
the
beloved
face
that
he
could
not
see
eh
laddie
i
dinna
ken
what
to
do
wi
ye
we
maun
juist
hae
to
sleep
it
did
not
occur
to
auld
jock
that
he
could
abandon
the
little
dog
and
then
there
drifted
across
his
memory
a
bit
of
traill
talk
that
at
the
time
had
seemed
to
no
purpose
sir
walter
happed
the
wee
lassie
in
the
pocket
of
his
plaid
he
slapped
his
knee
in
silent
triumph
in
the
dark
he
found
the
broad
open
end
of
the
plaid
and
the
rough
excited
head
of
the
little
dog
a
hap

in
bobby
jumped
into
the
pocket
and
turned
and
his
little
muzzle
opened
for
a
delighted
bark
at
this
original
play
but
auld
jock
checked
him
cuddle
doon
noo
an
lie
canny
as
with
a
deft
turn
he
brought
the
weighted
end
of
the
plaid
up
under
his
arm
so
there
would
be
no

he
chuckled
he
mounted
the
stairs
almost
blithely
and
knocked
on
one
of
the
three
narrow
doors
that
opened
on
the
landing
it
was
opened
a
few
inches
on
a
chain
and
a
sordid
old
face
framed
in
straggling
gray
locks
and
a
dirty
mutch
cap
peered
suspiciously
at
him
through
the
crevice
auld
jock
had
his
money
in
hand
a
shilling
and
a
sixpence
to
pay
for
a
week
lodging
he
had
slept
in
this
place
for
several
winters
and
the
old
woman
knew
him
well
but
she
held
his
coins
to
the
candle
and
bit
them
with
her
teeth
to
test
them
without
a
word
of
greeting
she
shoved
the
key
to
the
he
had
always
fancied
through
the
crack
in
the
door
and
pointed
to
a
jug
of
water
at
the
foot
of
the
attic
stairs
on
the
proffer
of
a
halfpenny
she
gave
him
a
tallow
candle
lighted
it
at
her
own
and
fitted
it
into
the
neck
of
a
beer
bottle
ye

that
auld

answered
he
smothered
a
cough
in
his
chest
with
such
effort
that
it
threw
him
into
a
perspiration
in
some
way
with
the
jug
of
water
and
the
lighted
candle
in
his
hands
and
the
hidden
terrier
under
one
arm
the
old
man
mounted
the
wide
attic
stairs
and
unlocked
the
first
of
a
number
of
narrow
doors
on
the
passage
at
the
top
weel
aboon
the
fou
smell
indeed
weel
worth
the
lang
climb
around
the
loose
frames
of
two
wee
dormer
windows
that
jutted
from
the
slope
of
the
gable
came
a
gush
of
air
auld
jock
tumbled
bobby
warm
and
happy
and
nane
the
wiser
out
into
the
cold
cell
of
a
room
that
was
oh
so
very
very
different
from
the
high
warm
richly
colored
library
of
sir
walter
this
garret
closet
in
the
slums
of
edinburgh
was
all
of
cut
stone
except
for
the
worn
oaken
floor
a
flimsy
modern
door
and
a
thin
board
partition
on
one
side
through
which
a
neebor
could
be
heard
snoring
filling
all
of
the
outer
wall
between
the
peephole
leaded
windows
and
to
the
slope
of
the
ceiling
was
a
great
fireplace
of
native
white
freestone
carved
into
fluted
columns
foliated
capitals
and
a
flat
pediment
of
purest
classic
lines
the
ballroom
of
a
noble
of
queen
mary
day
had
been
cut
up
into
numerous
small
sleeping
closets
many
of
them
windowless
and
were
let
to
the
chance
lodger
at
threepence
the
night
here
where
generations
of
dancing
toes
had
been
warmed
the
chimney
vent
was
bricked
up
and
a
shelf
fitted
to
serve
for
a
bed
a
seat
and
a
table
for
such
as
had
neither
time
nor
heart
for
dancing
for
the
romantic
history
and
the
beauty
of
it
auld
jock
had
no
mind
at
all
but
ah
he
had
other
joy
often
missed
by
the
more
fortunate
be
canny
bobby
he
cautioned
again
the
sagacious
little
dog
understood
and
pattered
about
the
place
silently
exhausting
it
in
a
moment
and
very
plainly
puzzled
and
bored
he
sat
on
his
haunches
yawned
wide
and
looked
up
inquiringly
to
his
master
auld
jock
set
the
jug
and
the
candle
on
the
floor
and
slipped
off
his
boots
he
had
no
wish
to
wauken
with
nervous
haste
he
threw
back
one
of
the
windows
on
its
hinges
reached
across
the
wide
stone
ledge
and
brought
of
wonders
in
such
a
place
a
tiny
earthen
pot
of
heather
is
it
no
a
bonny
posie
he
whispered
to
bobby
with
this
cherished
bit
of
the
country
that
he
had
left
behind
him
the
april
before
in
his
hands
he
sat
down
in
the
fireplace
bed
and
lifted
bobby
beside
him
he
sniffed
at
the
red
tuft
of
purple
bloom
fondly
and
his
old
face
blossomed
into
smiles
it
was
the
secret
thought
of
this
and
of
the
hillward
outlook
from
the
little
windows
that
had
ironed
the
lines
from
his
face
in
traill
bobby
sniffed
at
the
starved
plant
too
and
wagged
his
tail
with
pleasure
for
a
dog
keenest
memories
are
recorded
by
the
nose
overhead
loose
tiles
and
finials
rattled
in
the
wind
that
was
dying
away
in
fitful
gusts
but
auld
jock
heard
nothing
in
fancy
he
was
away
on
the
braes
in
the
shy
sun
and
wild
wet
of
april
weather
shepherds
were
shouting
sheepdogs
barking
ewes
bleating
and
a
wee
puppy
still
unnamed
scampering
at
his
heels
in
the
swift
dramatic
days
of
lambing
time
and
so
presently
when
the
forlorn
hope
of
the
little
pot
had
been
restored
to
the
ledge
master
and
dog
were
in
tune
with
the
open
country
and
began
a
romp
such
as
they
often
had
indulged
in
behind
the
byre
on
a
quiet
sabbath
afternoon
they
had
learned
to
play
there
like
two
children
in
pantomime
so
as
not
to
scandalize
pious
countryfolk
now
in
obedience
to
a
gesture
a
nod
a
lifted
eyebrow
bobby
went
through
all
his
pretty
tricks
and
showed
how
far
his
serious
education
had
he
rolled
over
and
over
begged
vaulted
the
low
hurdle
of
his
arm
and
played
he
scampered
madly
over
imaginary
pastures
ran
straight
as
a
string
along
a
stone
wall
scrambled
under
a
thorny
hedge
chased
rabbits
and
dug
foxes
out
of
holes
swam
a
burn
flushed
feeding
curlews
and
froze
beside
a
when
the
excitement
was
at
its
height
and
the
little
dog
was
bursting
with
exuberance
auld
jock
forgot
his
caution
holding
his
bonnet
just
out
of
reach
he
cried
aloud
loup
bobby
bobby
jumped
for
the
bonnet
missed
it
jumped
again
and
penetrating
yelp
of
the
terrier
instantly
their
little
house
of
joy
tumbled
about
their
ears
there
was
a
pounding
on
the
thin
partition
wall
an
oath
and
a
shout
the
deil
o
a
dog
bobby
flew
at
the
insulting
clamor
but
auld
jock
dragged
him
back
roughly
in
a
voice
made
harsh
by
fear
for
his
little
pet
he
commanded
haud
yer
gab
or
they
hae
ye
bobby
dropped
like
a
shot
cringing
at
auld
jock
feet
the
most
sensitive
of
creatures
in
the
world
the
skye
terrier
is
utterly
abased
by
a
rebuke
from
his
master
the
whole
garret
was
soon
in
an
uproar
of
vile
accusation
and
shrill
denial
that
spread
from
cell
to
cell
auld
jock
glowered
down
at
bobby
with
frightened
eyes
in
the
winters
he
had
lodged
there
he
had
lived
unmolested
only
because
he
had
managed
to
escape
notice
timid
old
country
body
that
he
was
he
could
not
fecht
it
oot
with
the
thieves
and
beggars
and
drunkards
of
the
cowgate
by
and
by
the
brawling
died
down
in
the
double
row
of
little
dens
this
one
alone
was
silent
and
the
offending
dog
was
not
located
but
when
the
danger
was
past
auld
jock
heart
was
pounding
in
his
chest
his
legs
gave
way
under
him
when
he
got
up
to
fetch
the
candle
from
near
the
door
and
set
it
on
a
projecting
brick
in
the
fireplace
by
its
light
he
began
to
read
in
a
small
pocket
bible
the
psalm
that
had
always
fascinated
him
because
he
had
never
been
able
to
understand
it
the
lord
is
my
shepherd
i
shall
not
so
far
it
was
plain
and
comforting
he
maketh
me
to
lie
down
in
green
pastures
he
leadeth
me
beside
the
still
nae
the
pastures
were
brown
or
purple
and
yellow
with
heather
and
gorse
rocks
cropped
out
everywhere
and
the
peaty
tarps
were
mostly
bleak
and
frozen
the
broad
firth
was
ever
ebbing
and
flowing
with
the
restless
sea
and
the
burns
bickering
down
the
glens
the
minister
of
the
little
hill
kirk
had
said
once
that
in
england
the
pastures
were
green
and
the
lakes
still
and
bright
but
that
was
a
fey
foreign
country
to
which
auld
jock
had
no
desire
to
go
he
wondered
wistfully
if
he
would
feel
at
home
in
god
heaven
and
if
there
would
be
room
in
that
lush
silence
for
a
noisy
little
dog
as
there
was
on
the
rough
pentland
braes
and
there
his
thoughts
came
back
to
this
cold
prison
cell
in
which
he
could
not
defend
the
right
of
his
one
faithful
little
friend
to
live
he
stooped
and
lifted
bobby
into
the
bed
humble
and
eager
to
be
forgiven
for
an
offense
he
could
not
understand
the
loving
little
creature
leaped
to
auld
jock
arms
and
lavished
frantic
endearments
upon
him
lying
so
together
in
the
dark
man
and
dog
fell
into
a
sleep
that
was
broken
by
auld
jock
fitful
coughing
and
the
abuse
of
his
neighbors
it
was
not
until
the
wind
had
long
died
to
a
muffled
murmur
at
the
casements
and
every
other
lodger
was
out
that
auld
jock
slept
soundly
he
awoke
late
to
find
bobby
waiting
patiently
on
the
floor
and
the
bare
cell
flooded
with
white
glory
that
could
mean
but
one
thing
he
stumbled
dizzily
to
his
feet
and
threw
a
sash
aback
over
the
huddle
of
high
housetops
the
university
towers
and
the
scattered
suburbs
beyond
he
looked
away
to
the
slopes
of
the
pentlands
running
up
to
heaven
and
shining
under
the
pale
winter
sunshine
the
snaw
eh
bobby
but
it
a
bonny
sicht
to
auld
een
he
cried
with
the
simple
delight
of
a
child
he
stooped
to
lift
bobby
to
the
wonder
of
it
when
the
world
suddenly
went
black
and
roaring
around
in
his
head
staggering
back
he
crumpled
up
in
a
pitiful
heap
on
the
floor
bobby
licked
his
master
face
and
hands
and
then
sat
quietly
down
beside
him
so
many
strange
uncanny
things
had
happened
within
the
last
hours
that
the
little
dog
was
rapidly
outgrowing
his
irresponsible
puppyhood
after
a
long
time
auld
jock
opened
his
eyes
and
sat
up
bobby
put
his
paws
on
his
master
knees
in
anxious
sympathy
before
the
man
had
got
his
wits
about
him
the
boomed
from
the
castle
that
he
should
have
slept
in
his
bed
so
late
and
then
lain
senseless
on
the
floor
for
he
knew
not
how
long
auld
jock
got
up
and
struggled
into
his
greatcoat
bonnet
and
plaid
in
feeling
for
his
woolen
mittens
he
discovered
the
buns
that
mr
trail
had
dropped
into
his
pocket
for
bobby
the
old
man
stared
and
stared
at
them
in
piteous
dismay
traill
had
believed
him
to
be
so
ill
that
he
wouldna
be
oot
the
it
was
a
staggering
thought
the
bells
of
giles
broke
into
over
the
hills
and
far
the
melody
came
to
auld
jock
clearly
unbroken
by
echoes
for
the
garret
was
on
a
level
with
the
cathedral
crown
on
high
street
it
brought
to
him
again
a
vision
of
the
midlothian
slopes
but
it
reminded
bobby
that
it
was
he
told
auld
jock
so
by
running
to
the
door
and
back
and
begging
him
by
every
pretty
wile
at
his
command
to
go
the
old
man
got
to
his
feet
and
then
fell
back
pale
and
shaken
his
heart
hammering
again
bobby
ate
the
bun
soberly
and
then
sat
up
against
auld
feet
that
dangled
helplessly
from
the
bed
the
bells
died
away
from
the
man
ears
before
they
had
ceased
playing
both
the
church
and
the
university
bells
struck
the
hour
of
two
then
three
then
four
daylight
had
begun
to
fail
when
auld
jock
stirred
sat
up
and
did
a
strange
thing
taking
from
his
pocket
a
leather
that
was
closed
by
a
he
counted
the
few
crowns
and
shillings
in
it
and
the
many
smaller
silver
and
copper
coins
there
eneugh
he
said
there
was
enough
by
careful
spending
to
pay
for
food
and
lodging
for
a
few
weeks
to
save
himself
from
the
charity
of
the
infirmary
by
this
act
he
admitted
the
humiliating
and
fearful
fact
that
he
was
very
ill
the
precious
little
hoard
must
be
hidden
from
the
chance
prowler
he
looked
for
a
loose
brick
in
the
fireplace
but
before
he
found
one
he
forgot
all
about
it
and
heaped
the
coins
in
a
little
pile
on
the
open
bible
at
the
back
of
the
bed
for
a
long
time
auld
jock
sat
there
with
his
head
in
his
hands
before
he
again
slipped
back
to
his
pillow
darkness
stole
into
the
quiet
room
the
lodgers
returned
to
their
dens
one
after
one
tramping
or
slipping
or
hobbling
up
the
stairs
and
along
the
passage
bobby
bristled
and
froze
on
guard
when
a
stealthy
hand
tried
the
latch
then
there
were
sounds
of
fighting
of
crying
women
and
the
long
low
wailing
children
the
evening
drum
and
bugle
were
heard
from
the
castle
and
hour
after
hour
was
struck
from
the
clock
of
giles
while
bobby
watched
beside
his
master
all
night
auld
jock
was
aff
when
he
muttered
in
his
sleep
or
cried
out
in
the
delirium
of
fever
the
little
dog
put
his
paws
upon
the
he
scratched
on
it
and
begged
to
be
lifted
to
where
he
could
comfort
his
master
for
the
shelf
was
set
too
high
for
him
to
climb
into
the
bed
unable
to
get
his
master
attention
he
licked
the
hot
hand
that
hung
over
the
side
auld
jock
lay
still
at
last
not
coughing
any
more
but
breathing
rapid
shallow
breaths
just
at
dawn
he
turned
his
head
and
gazed
in
bewilderment
at
the
alert
and
troubled
little
creature
that
was
instantly
upon
the
rail
after
a
long
time
he
recognized
the
dog
and
patted
the
shaggy
little
head
feeling
around
the
bed
he
found
the
other
bun
and
dropped
it
on
the
floor
presently
he
said
between
strangled
breaths
puir
bobby
gang
awa
hame
after
that
it
was
suddenly
very
still
in
the
brightening
room
bobby
gazed
and
gazed
at
his
master
one
long
heartbroken
look
then
dropped
to
all
fours
and
stood
trembling
without
another
look
he
stretched
himself
upon
the
hearthstone
below
the
bed
morning
and
evening
footsteps
went
down
and
came
up
on
the
stairs
throughout
the
day
the
babel
of
crowded
tenement
strife
the
crying
of
fishwives
and
in
the
court
the
striking
of
the
hours
the
boom
of
the
time
gun
and
sweet
clamor
of
music
bells
the
failing
of
the
light
and
the
soaring
note
of
the
bugle
he
watched
motionless
beside
his
master
very
late
at
night
shuffling
footsteps
came
up
the
stairs
the
auld
wifie
kept
a
sharp
eye
on
the
comings
and
goings
of
her
lodgers
it
was
no
canny
that
this
old
man
with
a
cauld
in
his
chest
had
gone
up
full
two
days
before
and
had
not
come
down
again
to
bitter
complaints
of
his
coughing
and
of
his
strange
talking
to
himself
she
gave
scant
attention
but
foul
play
was
done
often
enough
in
these
dens
to
make
her
uneasy
she
had
no
desire
to
have
the
burgh
police
coming
about
and
interfering
with
her
business
she
knocked
sharply
on
the
door
and
called
auld
jock
bobby
trotted
over
to
the
door
and
stood
looking
at
it
in
such
a
strait
he
would
naturally
have
welcomed
the
visitor
scratching
on
the
panel
and
crying
to
any
human
body
without
to
come
in
and
see
what
had
befallen
his
master
but
auld
jock
had
bade
him
haud
gab
there
as
in
greyfriars
kirkyard
so
he
held
to
loyal
silence
although
the
knocking
and
shaking
of
the
latch
was
insistent
and
the
lodgers
were
astir
the
voice
of
the
old
woman
was
shrill
with
alarm
auld
jock
can
ye
no
wauken
and
after
a
moment
in
which
the
unlatched
casement
window
within
could
be
heard
creaking
on
its
hinges
in
the
chill
breeze
there
was
a
hushed
and
frightened
question
are
ye
deid
the
footsteps
fled
down
the
stairs
and
bobby
was
left
to
watch
through
the
long
hours
of
darkness
very
early
in
the
morning
the
flimsy
door
was
quietly
forced
by
authority
the
first
man
who
entered
an
officer
of
the
crown
from
the
sheriff
court
on
the
bridge
took
off
his
hat
to
the
majesty
that
dominated
that
bare
cell
the
cowgate
region
presented
many
a
startling
contrast
but
such
a
one
as
this
must
seldom
have
been
seen
the
classic
fireplace
and
the
motionless
figure
and
peaceful
face
of
the
pious
old
shepherd
within
it
had
the
dignity
and
beauty
of
some
monumental
tomb
and
carved
effigy
in
old
greyfriars
kirkyard
only
less
strange
was
the
contrast
between
the
marks
of
poverty
and
toil
on
the
dead
man
and
the
dainty
grace
of
the
little
fluff
of
a
dog
that
mourned
him
no
such
men
as
these
officers
of
her
majesty
the
queen
burgh
policemen
and
learned
doctors
from
the
royal
infirmary
had
ever
been
aware
of
auld
jock
living
dead
and
no
needing
them
any
more
they
stood
guard
over
him
and
inquired
sternly
as
to
the
manner
in
which
he
had
died
there
was
a
hysterical
breath
of
relief
from
the
crowd
of
lodgers
and
tenants
when
the
little
pile
of
coins
was
found
on
the
bible
there
had
been
no
foul
play
auld
jock
had
died
of
heart
failure
from
pneumonia
and
old
age
there
eneugh
a
burgh
policeman
said
when
the
money
was
counted
he
meant
much
the
same
thing
auld
jock
himself
had
meant
there
was
enough
to
save
him
from
the
last
indignity
a
life
of
useful
labor
can
thrust
upon
the
honest
poor
pauper
burial
but
when
inquiries
were
made
for
the
name
and
the
friends
of
this
old
man
there
appeared
to
be
only
auld
jock
to
enter
into
the
record
and
a
little
dog
to
follow
the
body
to
the
grave
it
was
a
bible
reader
who
chanced
to
come
in
from
the
medical
mission
in
the
cowgate
who
thought
to
look
in
the
of
auld
jock
bible
his
name
is
john
he
laid
the
worn
little
book
on
auld
jock
breast
and
crossed
the
hands
upon
it
it
something
by
the
ordinar
to
find
a
gude
auld
country
body
in
such
a
foul
he
stooped
and
patted
bobby
and
noted
the
bun
untouched
upon
the
floor
turning
to
a
wild
elf
of
a
barefooted
child
in
the
crowd
he
spoke
to
her
would
you
share
your
gude
brose
with
the
bit
dog
lassie
she
darted
down
the
stairs
and
presently
returned
with
her
own
scanty
bowl
of
breakfast
porridge
bobby
refused
the
food
but
he
looked
at
her
so
mournfully
that
the
first
tears
of
pity
her
unchildlike
eyes
had
ever
shed
welled
up
she
put
out
her
hand
timidly
and
stroked
him
it
was
just
before
the
report
of
the
that
two
policemen
cleared
the
stairs
shrouded
auld
jock
in
his
own
greatcoat
and
plaid
and
carried
him
down
to
the
court
there
they
laid
him
in
a
plain
box
of
white
deal
that
stood
on
the
pavement
closed
it
and
went
away
down
the
wynd
on
a
necessary
errand
the
sat
on
an
empty
beer
keg
to
guard
the
box
and
bobby
climbed
on
the
top
and
stretched
himself
above
his
master
the
court
was
a
well
more
than
a
hundred
feet
deep
what
sky
might
have
been
visible
above
it
was
hidden
by
tier
above
tier
of
dingy
tattered
washings
the
stairway
filled
again
and
throngs
of
outcasts
of
every
sort
went
about
their
squalid
businesses
with
only
a
curious
glance
or
so
at
the
pathetic
group
presently
the
policemen
returned
from
the
cowgate
with
a
motley
assortment
of
pallbearers
there
was
a
irish
laborer
from
a
brewery
a
decayed
gentleman
unsteady
of
gait
and
in
greasy
and
broken
hat
a
flashily
dressed
bartender
who
found
the
task
distasteful
a
stout
a
drunken
fisherman
from
new
haven
suddenly
sobered
by
this
uncanny
duty
and
a
furtive
thief
who
feared
a
trap
and
tried
to
escape
tailed
by
scuffling
gamins
the
strange
little
procession
moved
quickly
down
the
wynd
and
turned
into
the
roaring
cowgate
the
policemen
went
before
to
force
a
passage
through
the
press
the
followed
the
box
and
bobby
head
and
tail
down
trotted
unnoticed
beneath
it
the
humble
funeral
train
passed
under
a
bridge
arch
into
the
empty
grassmarket
and
went
up
candlemakers
row
to
the
kirkyard
gate
such
as
auld
jock
now
by
unnumbered
thousands
were
coming
to
lie
among
the
grand
and
great
laird
and
leddy
poet
and
prophet
persecutor
and
martyr
in
the
historic
of
old
greyfriars
by
a
gesture
the
caretaker
directed
the
bearers
to
the
right
past
the
church
and
on
down
the
crowded
slope
to
the
north
that
was
circled
about
by
the
backs
of
the
tenements
in
the
grassmarket
and
candlemakers
row
the
box
was
lowered
at
once
and
the
hastily
departed
to
delayed
dinners
the
policemen
had
urgent
duties
elsewhere
only
the
bible
reader
remained
to
see
the
grave
partly
filled
in
and
to
try
to
persuade
bobby
to
go
away
with
him
but
the
little
dog
resisted
with
such
piteous
struggles
that
the
man
put
him
down
again
the
grave
digger
leaned
on
his
spade
for
a
bit
of
professional
talk
many
a
dog
gangs
daft
an
greets
like
a
human
body
when
his
maister
dees
they
aye
put
oot
a
time
or
twa

yersel

he
wullna
greet
since
bobby
would
not
go
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
leave
him
there
but
it
was
with
many
a
backward
look
and
disturbing
doubt
that
the
good
man
turned
away
the
finished
his
task
cheerfully
shouldered
his
tools
and
left
the
kirkyard
the
early
dark
was
coming
on
when
the
caretaker
in
making
his
last
rounds
found
the
little
terrier
flattened
out
on
the
mound
gang
awa
oot
he
ordered
bobby
looked
up
pleadingly
and
trembled
but
he
made
no
motion
to
obey
james
brown
was
not
an
unfeeling
man
and
he
was
but
doing
his
duty
from
an
impulse
of
pity
for
this
bonny
wee
bit
of
loyalty
and
grief
he
picked
bobby
up
carried
him
all
the
way
to
the
gate
and
set
him
over
the
wicket
on
the
pavement
gang
awa
hame
noo
he
said
kindly
a
isna
a
place
for
a
bit
dog
to
be
bobby
lay
where
he
had
been
dropped
until
the
caretaker
was
out
of
sight
then
finding
the
aperture
under
the
gate
too
small
for
him
to
squeeze
through
he
tried
in
his
ancestral
way
to
enlarge
it
by
digging
he
scratched
and
scratched
at
the
unyielding
stone
until
his
little
claws
were
broken
and
his
toes
bleeding
before
he
stopped
and
lay
down
with
his
nose
under
the
wicket
just
before
the
closing
hour
a
carriage
stopped
at
the
kirkyard
gate
a
lady
carrying
flowers
hurried
through
the
wicket
bobby
slipped
in
behind
her
and
disappeared
after
nightfall
when
the
lamps
were
lighted
on
the
bridge
when
traill
had
come
out
to
stand
idly
in
his
doorway
looking
for
some
one
to
talk
to
and
james
brown
had
locked
the
kirkyard
yard
gate
for
the
night
and
gone
into
his
little
stone
lodge
to
supper
bobby
came
out
of
hiding
and
stretched
himself
prone
across
auld
jock
grave
iv
fifteen
minutes
after
the
report
of
the
on
monday
when
the
bells
were
playing
their
merriest
and
the
were
busiest
traill
felt
such
a
tiny
tug
at
his
that
it
was
repeated
before
he
gave
it
attention
in
the
press
of
hungry
guests
bobby
had
little
more
than
room
to
rise
in
his
pretty
begging
attitude
the
landlord
was
so
relieved
to
see
him
again
after
five
conscience
stricken
days
that
he
stooped
to
clap
the
little
dog
on
the
side
and
to
greet
him
with
jocose
approval
gude
dog
to
fetch
auld
jock
with
a
faint
and
piteous
cry
that
was
heard
by
no
one
but
traill
bobby
toppled
over
on
the
floor
it
was
a
limp
little
bundle
that
the
landlord
picked
up
from
under
foot
and
held
on
his
arm
a
moment
while
he
looked
around
for
the
dog
master
shocked
at
not
seeing
auld
jock
by
a
kind
of
inspiration
he
carried
the
little
dog
to
the
inglenook
and
laid
him
down
under
the
familiar
settle
bobby
was
little
more
than
breathing
but
he
opened
his
silkily
veiled
brown
eyes
and
licked
the
friendly
hand
that
had
done
this
refinement
of
kindness
it
took
traill
more
than
a
moment
to
realize
the
nature
of
the
trouble
a
dog
with
so
thick
a
fleece
of
wool
under
so
crisply
waving
an
outer
coat
as
bobby
may
perish
for
lack
of
food
and
show
no
outward
sign
of
emaciation
the
sonsie
wee
why
he
all
but
starved
pale
with
pity
traill
snatched
a
plate
of
broth
from
the
hands
of
a
gaping
waiter
laddie
set
it
under
bobby
nose
and
watched
him
begin
to
lap
the
warm
liquid
eagerly
in
the
busy
place
the
incident
passed
unnoticed
with
his
usual
brisk
decision
traill
turned
the
backs
of
a
couple
of
chairs
over
against
the
nearest
table
to
signify
that
the
corner
was
reserved
and
he
went
about
his
duties
with
unwonted
silence
as
the
crowd
thinned
he
returned
to
the
inglenook
to
find
bobby
asleep
not
curled
up
in
a
tousled
ball
as
such
a
little
dog
should
be
but
stretched
on
his
side
and
breathing
irregularly
if
bobby
was
in
such
straits
how
must
it
be
with
auld
jock
this
was
the
fifth
day
since
the
sick
old
man
had
fled
into
the
storm
with
new
disquiet
traill
remembered
a
matter
that
had
annoyed
him
in
the
morning
and
that
he
had
been
inclined
to
charge
to
mischievous
heriot
boys
low
down
on
the
outside
of
his
freshly
varnished
entrance
door
were
many
scratches
that
bobby
could
have
made
he
may
have
come
for
food
on
the
sabbath
day
when
the
place
was
closed
after
an
hour
bobby
woke
long
enough
to
eat
a
generous
plate
of
that
delectable
and
highly
nourishing
scotch
dish
known
as
haggis
he
fell
asleep
again
in
an
easier
attitude
that
relieved
the
tension
on
the
landlord
feelings
confident
that
the
devoted
little
dog
would
lead
him
straight
to
his
master
traill
closed
the
door
securely
that
he
might
not
escape
unnoticed
and
arranged
his
own
worldly
affairs
so
he
could
leave
them
to
hirelings
on
the
instant
in
the
idle
time
between
dinner
and
supper
he
sat
down
by
the
fire
lighted
his
pipe
repented
his
unruly
tongue
and
waited
as
the
short
day
darkened
to
its
close
the
sunset
bugle
was
blown
in
the
castle
at
the
first
note
bobby
crept
from
under
the
settle
a
little
unsteady
on
his
legs
as
yet
wagged
his
tail
for
thanks
and
trotted
to
the
door
traill
had
no
trouble
at
all
in
keeping
the
little
dog
in
sight
to
the
kirkyard
gate
for
in
the
dusk
his
coat
shone
silvery
white
indeed
by
a
backward
look
now
and
then
bobby
seemed
to
invite
the
man
to
follow
and
waited
at
the
gate
with
some
impatience
for
him
to
come
up
help
was
needed
there
by
rising
and
tugging
at
clothing
and
then
jumping
on
the
wicket
bobby
plainly
begged
to
have
it
opened
he
made
no
noise
neither
barking
nor
whimpering
and
that
was
very
strange
for
a
dog
of
the
terrier
breed
but
each
instant
of
delay
he
became
more
insistent
and
even
frantic
to
have
the
gate
unlatched
traill
refused
to
believe
what
bobby
behavior
indicated
and
reproved
him
in
the
broad
scotch
to
which
the
country
dog
was
used
nae
bobby
be
a
gude
dog
gang
doon
to
the
coogate
noo
an
find
auld
uttering
no
cry
at
all
bobby
gave
the
man
such
a
woebegone
look
and
dropped
to
the
pavement
with
his
long
muzzle
as
far
under
the
wicket
as
he
could
thrust
it
that
the
truth
shot
home
to
understanding
he
opened
the
gate
bobby
slipped
through
and
stood
just
inside
a
moment
and
looking
back
as
if
he
expected
his
human
friend
to
follow
then
very
suddenly
as
the
door
of
the
lodge
opened
and
the
caretaker
came
out
bobby
disappeared
in
the
shadow
of
the
church
a
man
of
the
best
country
type
serviceably
dressed
in
corduroy
wool
bonnet
and
ribbed
stockings
james
brown
collided
with
the
small
and
wiry
landlord
to
his
own
very
great
embarrassment
eh
maister
traill
ye
gied
me
a
turn
it
no
canny
to

i
the
whaur

there
no

but
traill
brushed
this
irrelevant
pleasantry
aside
ay
there
a

my
the

exploded
with
wrath
syne
i

there
arguing

and
necessary
regulation
but
it
no
the
law
o
the
land
i
turned
the
dog
in
to
settle
a
matter
with
my
ain
conscience
and
john
knox
would
have
done
the
same
thing
in
the
bonny
face
o
queen
mary
what
it
is
is
nae
beesiness
of
yours
the
dog
was
a
sma
young
terrier
of
the
highland
breed
but
with
a
drop
to
his
ears
and
a
crinkle
in
his
frosty
coat
just
an
ordinar
dog
i
know
him
weel
he
came
to
my
place
to
be
fed
near
dead
of
hunger
then
led
me
here
if
his
master
lies
in
this
kirkyard
i
tak
the
bit
dog
awa
with
traill
astonishing
fluency
always
carried
all
walls
of
resistance
before
it
with
men
of
slower
wit
and
speech
only
a
superior
man
could
brush
rules
aside
so
curtly
and
stand
on
his
human
rights
so
surely
james
brown
pulled
his
bonnet
off
deferentially
scratched
his
shock
head
and
shifted
his
pipe
finally
he
admitted
weel
there
was
a
bit
tyke
i
the
kirkyaird
twa
days
syne
i
put
oot
an
haena

aboot

he
offered
however
to
show
the
mound
on
which
he
had
found
the
dog
leading
the
way
past
the
church
he
went
on
down
the
terraced
slope
prolonging
the
walk
with
conversation
for
the
guardianship
of
an
old
churchyard
offers
very
little
such
lively
company
as
john
traill
i
mind
noo
it
was
some
puir
body
frae
the
coogate
wi
no
ony

but
the
sma

aneath
the
coffin
i
let

to
mak

there
no
any
ay
that
would
be
auld
jock
and
bobby
would
no
be
leaving
him
insisted
the
landlord
stubbornly
he
stood
looking
down
at
the
rough
mound
of
frozen
clods
heaped
in
a
little
space
of
trampled
snow
jeemes
brown
mr
trail
said
at
last
the
man
wha
lies
here
was
a
decent
pious
auld
country
body
and
i
drove
him
to
his
meeserable
death
in
the
man
ye
dinna
ken
what
ye
sayin
was
the
shocked
response
do
i
no
i
canny
by
the
ordinar
but
my
fule
tongue
will
get
me
into
trouble
with
the
magistrates
one
of
these
days
it
aye
wags
at
both
ends
and
is
no
tied
in
the
then
stanch
calvinist
that
he
was
and
never
dreaming
that
he
was
indulging
in
the
sinful
pleasure
of
confession
traill
poured
out
the
story
of
auld
jock
plight
and
of
his
own
shortcomings
it
was
a
bitter
upbraiding
thing
that
he
an
uncommonly
capable
man
had
meant
so
well
by
a
humble
old
body
and
done
so
and
he
had
failed
again
when
he
tried
to
undo
the
mischief
the
very
next
morning
he
had
gone
down
into
the
perilous
cowgate
and
inquired
in
every
place
where
it
might
be
possible
for
such
a
timid
old
shepherd
to
be
known
but
there
as
well
look
for
a
burr
thistle
in
a
bin
of
oats
as
look
for
a
human
atom
in
the
cowgate
and
the
wynds
juist
weel
noo
ye
couldna
hae
dune
aething

the
auld
body

trying
to
console
the
man
could
i
no
ye
dinna

as
weel
as
ye
the
disgusted
landlord
tumbled
into
broad
scotch

to

i
was
leein
an
syne
they
hae
hustled
aff
to
a
snug
the
energetic
little
man
looked
so
entirely
capable
of
any
daring
deed
that
he
fired
the
caretaker
into
enthusiastic
search
for
bobby
it
was
not
entirely
dark
for
the
sky
was
studded
with
stars
snow
lay
in
broad
patches
on
the
slope
and
all
about
the
lower
end
of
the
kirkyard
supper
candles
burned
at
every
rear
window
of
the
tall
tenements
the
two
men
searched
among
the
slabs
and
and
scattered
thorn
bushes
they
circled
the
monument
to
all
the
martyrs
who
had
died
heroically
in
the
grassmarket
and
elsewhere
for
their
faith
they
hunted
in
the
deep
shadows
of
the
buttresses
along
the
side
of
the
auld
kirk
and
among
the
pillars
of
the
octagonal
portico
to
the
new
at
the
rear
of
the
long
low
building
that
was
clumsily
partitioned
across
for
two
pulpits
stood
the
ornate
tomb
of
bluidy
mckenzie
but
bobby
had
not
committed
himself
to
the
mercy
of
the
hanging
judge
nor
yet
to
the
care
of
the
doughty
minister
who
from
the
pulpit
of
greyfriars
auld
kirk
had
flung
the
blood
and
tear
stained
covenant
in
the
teeth
of
persecution
the
search
was
continued
past
the
modest
scott
family
burial
plot
and
on
to
the
west
wall
there
was
a
broad
outlook
over
heriot
hospital
grounds
a
smooth
and
shining
expanse
of
unsullied
snow
about
the
early
elizabethan
pile
of
buildings
returning
they
skirted
the
lowest
wall
below
the
tenements
for
in
the
circling
line
of
courtyarded
vaults
where
the
nobeelity
of
scotland
lay
haughtily
apart
under
timestained
marbles
were
many
shadowy
nooks
in
which
so
small
a
dog
could
stow
himself
away
skulking
cats
were
flushed
there
and
sent
flying
over
aristocratic
bones
but
there
was
no
trace
of
bobby
the
second
tier
of
windows
of
the
tenements
was
level
with
the
kirkyard
wall
and
several
times
traill
called
up
to
a
lighted
casement
where
a
family
sat
at
a
scant
supper
have
you
seen
a
bit
dog
man
there
was
much
cordial
interest
in
his
quest
windows
opening
and
faces
staring
into
the
dusk
but
not
until
near
the
top
of
the
row
was
a
clue
gained
then
at
the
query
an
unkempt
illclad
lassie
slipped
from
her
stool
and
leaned
out
over
the
pediment
of
a
tomb
she
had
seen
a
wee
wee
doggie
jinkin
amang
the
it
was
on
the
sabbath
evening
when
the
folk
had
gone
home
from
the
afternoon
services
she
was
eating
her
porridge
at
the
window
by
her
lane
when
he
keeked
up
at
her
so
knowing
and
begged
so
bonny
that
she
balanced
her
bit
bowl
on
a
lath
and
pushed
it
over
on
the
kirkyard
wall
as
she
finished
the
story
the
big
blue
eyes
of
the
little
maid
who
doubtless
had
herself
known
what
it
was
to
be
hungry
filled
with
tears
the
wee
tyke
couldna
loup
up
to
it
an
a
deil
o
a
pussy
got
it
a
he
was
so
bonny
like
a
leddy
pet
an
syne
he
fell
ower
on
the
snaw

awa
he
didna
cry
oot
but
he
was
a
but
deid
wi
at
the
memory
of
it
ailie
lindsey
sobbed
on
her
shoulder
the
tale
was
retold
from
one
excited
window
to
another
all
the
way
around
and
all
the
way
up
to
the
gables
so
quickly
could
some
incident
of
human
interest
make
a
social
gathering
in
the
populous
tenements
most
of
all
the
children
seized
upon
the
touching
story
eager
and
pinched
little
faces
peered
wistfully
into
the
melancholy
kirkyard
is
he
yer
ain
dog
crippled
tammy
barr
piped
out
in
his
thin
treble

his
master
lies
buried
here
and
the
leal
highlander
mourns
for
with
keener
appreciation
of
its
pathos
traill
recalled
that
this
was
what
auld
jock
had
said
bobby
isna
ma
ain
and
he
was
conscious
of
wishing
that
bobby
was
his
own
with
his
unpurchasable
love
and
a
loyalty
to
face
starvation
as
he
mounted
the
turfed
terraces
he
thought
to
call
back
if
you
see
him
again
lassie
call
him
and
fetch
him
up
to
greyfriars
i
have
a
bright
siller
shulling
with
the
queen
bonny
face
on
it
to
give
the
bairn
that
finds
there
was
excited
comment
on
this
he
must
indeed
be
an
attractive
dog
to
be
worth
a
shilling
the
children
generously
shared
plans
for
capturing
bobby
but
presently
the
windows
were
closed
and
supper
was
resumed
the
caretaker
was
irritable
noo
ye
hae
them
a
oot
swarmin
ower
the
kirkyaird
there
nae
coontin
the
bairns
o
the
neeborhood
an
nane
o
them
are
so
weel
broucht
up
as
they
micht
traill
commented
upon
this
philosophically
a
bairn
is
like
a
dog
in
mony
ways
tak
a
stick
to
one
or
the
other
and
he
misbehave
the
children
here
are
poor
and
neglected
but
they
no

like
the
awfu
imps
of
the
cowgate
wha
steal
from
their
blind
grandmithers
get
on
the
gude
side
of
the
bairns
man
and
you
live
easier
and
die
it
seemed
useless
to
search
the
much
longer
arm
of
the
kirkyard
that
ran
southward
behind
the
shops
of
greyfriars
place
and
forest
road
if
bobby
was
in
the
enclosure
at
all
he
would
not
be
far
from
auld
jock
grave
nearest
the
mound
were
two
very
old
and
dark
the
farther
one
lay
horizontally
on
its
upright
through
stanes
some
distance
above
the
earth
the
supports
of
the
other
had
fallen
and
the
table
lay
on
their
thickness
within
six
inches
of
the
ground
traill
and
the
caretaker
sat
upon
this
slab
which
testified
to
the
piety
and
worth
of
one
mistress
jean
grant
who
had
died
lang
encroached
upon
as
it
was
by
unlovely
life
greyfriars
kirkyard
was
yet
a
place
of
solitude
and
peace
the
building
had
the
dignity
that
only
old
age
can
give
it
had
lost
its
tower
by
an
explosion
of
gunpowder
stored
there
in
war
time
and
its
walls
and
many
of
the
ancient
tombs
bore
the
marks
of
fire
and
shot
within
the
last
decade
some
of
the
gothic
openings
had
been
filled
with
beautiful
memorial
windows
despite
the
horrors
and
absurdities
and
mutilation
of
much
of
the
funeral
sculpturing
the
kirkyard
had
a
sad
distinction
such
as
became
its
fame
as
scotland
westminster
and
there
was
one
heavenward
outlook
and
heavenly
view
over
the
tallest
decaying
tenement
one
could
look
up
to
the
castle
of
dreams
on
the
crag
and
drop
the
glance
all
the
way
down
the
pinnacled
crest
of
high
street
to
the
dark
and
deserted
palace
of
holyrood
after
nightfall
the
turreted
heights
wore
a
luminous
crown
and
the
steep
ridge
up
to
it
twinkled
with
myriad
lights
after
a
time
the
caretaker
offered
a
opinion
the
dog
maun

he
lie
a
the
day
under
a
whin
bush
on
the
brae
as
canny
as
a
fox
you
gave
bobby
a
reason
for
hiding
here
by
turning
him
out
and
auld
jock
was
a
vera
releegious
man
it
would
no
be
surprising
if
he
taught
bobby
to
hold
his
tongue
in
a
man
he
did
that
vera
james
brown
brought
his
fist
down
on
his
knee
for
suddenly
he
identified
bobby
as
the
snappy
little
ruffian
that
had
chased
the
cat
and
bitten
his
shins
and
auld
jock
as
the
scandalized
shepherd
who
had
rebuked
the
dog
so
bitterly
he
related
the
incident
with
gusto
the
auld
man
cried
oot
on
the
misbehavin
tyke
to
haud
gab
syne
ye
saw
the
bit
dog
like
for
a
bairn
that

a
kirkyaird
toes
afore
in
a
long
brown
was
sobered
by
this
grim
thought
and
then
in
his
turn
he
confessed
a
slip
to
this
tolerant
man
of
the
world
the
wee
deil
o
a
sperity
dog
nipped
me
so
i
let
oot
an
ay
that
bobby
he
would
no
be
afraid
of
onything
with
hide
or
hair
on
it
man
the
skye
terriers
go
into
dens
of
foxes
and
wildcats
and
worry
bulls
till
they
tak
to
their
heels
and
bobby
sagacious
by
the
he
thought
intently
for
a
moment
and
then
spoke
naturally
and
much
as
auld
jock
himself
might
have
spoken
to
the
dog
whaur
are
ye
bobby
come
awa
oot
laddie
instantly
the
little
dog
stood
before
him
like
some
conjured
ghost
he
had
slipped
from
under
the
slab
on
which
they
were
sitting
it
lay
so
near
the
ground
and
in
such
a
mat
of
dead
grass
that
it
had
not
occurred
to
them
to
look
for
him
there
he
came
up
to
traill
confidently
submitted
to
having
his
head
patted
and
looked
pleadingly
at
the
caretaker
then
thinking
he
had
permission
to
do
so
he
lay
down
on
the
mound
james
brown
dropped
his
pipe
it
maist
michty
he
said
traill
got
to
his
feet
briskly
i
just
tak
the
dog
with
me
brown
on
marketday
i
find
the
farmer
that
owns
him
and
send
him
hame
as
you
say
a
kirkyard
nae
place
for
a
dog
to
be
living
neglected
come
awa
bobby
looked
up
but
as
he
made
no
motion
to
obey
traill
stooped
and
lifted
him
from
sheer
surprise
at
this
unexpected
move
the
little
dog
lay
still
a
moment
on
the
man
arm
then
with
a
lithe
twist
of
his
muscular
body
and
a
spring
he
was
on
the
ground
trembling
reproachful
for
the
breach
of
faith
but
braced
for
resistance
eh
you
no
going
traill
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
looked
down
at
bobby
admiringly
and
sighed
there
a
dog
after
my
ain
heart
and
he
have
naething
to
do
with
me
he
has
a
mind
of
his
ain
just
have
to
be
leaving
him
here
the
two
days
ye
wullna
leave
ye
tak
wi
ye
or
i
hae
to
put
oot
man
i
couldna
haud
the
place
gin
i
brak
the
you
will
no
put
the
wee
dog
out
traill
shook
a
playful
emphatic
finger
under
the
big
man
nose
why
wull
i
no
because
man
you
have
a
vera
soft
heart
and
you
canna
deny
it
was
with
a
genial
confident
smile
that
traill
made
this
terrible
accusation
ma
heart
no
so
saft
as
to
permit
a
bit
dog
to
scandalize
the
he
been
here
two
days
you
no
knowing
it
and
he
has
scandalized
neither
the
dead
nor
the
living
he
as
leal
as
ony
covenanter
here
and
better
conducted
than
mony
a
laird
he
no
the
quarrelsome
kind
but
man
for
a
principle
he
fight
like
auld
here
the
landlord
heat
gave
way
to
pure
enjoyment
of
the
situation
eh
like
to
see
you
put
him
out
it
would
be
another
flodden
the
angry
caretaker
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
ye
can
see
it
gin
ye
stand
by
in
juist
one
meenit
fecht
as
he
may
it
wull
soon
be
traill
laughed
easily
and
ventured
the
opinion
that
bark
was
worse
than
his
bite
as
he
went
through
the
gateway
he
could
not
resist
calling
back
a
challenge
i
daur
you
to
do
brown
locked
the
gate
went
sulkily
into
the
lodge
lighted
his
cutty
pipe
and
smoked
it
furiously
he
read
a
psalm
with
deliberation
poked
up
an
already
bright
fire
and
glowered
at
his
placid
gude
wife
it
was
not
to
be
borne
to
be
defied
by
a
terrier
and
dared
by
a
man
a
third
under
his
own
weight
to
do
his
duty
after
an
hour
or
so
he
worked
himself
up
to
the
point
of
going
out
and
slamming
the
door
at
eight
traill
found
bobby
on
the
pavement
outside
the
locked
gate
he
was
not
sorry
that
the
fortunes
of
unequal
battle
had
thrown
the
faithful
little
dog
on
his
hospitality
bobby
begged
piteously
to
be
put
inside
but
he
seemed
to
understand
at
last
that
the
gate
was
too
high
for
traill
to
drop
him
over
he
followed
the
landlord
up
to
the
restaurant
willingly
he
may
have
thought
this
champion
had
another
solution
of
the
difficulty
for
when
he
saw
the
man
settle
comfortably
in
a
chair
he
refused
to
lie
on
the
hearth
he
ran
to
the
door
and
back
and
begged
and
whined
to
be
let
out
for
a
long
time
he
stood
dejectedly
he
was
not
sullen
for
he
ate
a
light
supper
and
thanked
his
host
with
much
polite
wagging
and
he
even
allowed
himself
to
be
petted
suddenly
he
thought
of
something
trotted
briskly
off
to
a
corner
and
crouched
there
traill
watched
the
attractive
little
creature
with
interest
and
growing
affection
very
likely
he
indulged
in
a
that
perhaps
the
tenant
of
cauldbrae
farm
could
be
induced
to
part
with
bobby
for
a
consideration
and
that
he
himself
could
win
the
dog
to
transfer
his
love
from
a
cold
grave
to
a
warm
hearth
with
a
spring
the
rat
was
captured
a
jerk
of
the
long
head
and
there
was
proof
of
bobby
prowess
to
lay
at
his
good
friend
feet
made
much
of
and
in
a
position
to
ask
fresh
favors
the
little
dog
was
off
to
the
door
with
cheerful
staccato
barks
his
reasoning
was
as
plain
as
print
i
hae
done
ye
a
service
noo
tak
me
back
to
the
traill
talked
to
him
as
he
might
have
reasoned
with
a
bright
bairn
bobby
listened
patiently
but
remained
of
the
same
mind
at
last
he
moved
away
disappointed
in
this
human
person
discouraged
but
undefeated
in
his
purpose
he
lay
down
by
the
door
traill
watched
him
for
if
any
chance
late
comer
opened
the
door
the
masterless
little
dog
would
be
out
into
the
perils
of
the
street
bobby
knew
what
doors
were
for
and
very
likely
expected
some
such
release
he
waited
a
long
time
patiently
then
he
began
to
run
back
and
forth
he
put
his
paws
upon
traill
and
whimpered
and
cried
finally
he
howled
it
was
a
dreadful
dismal
heartbroken
howl
that
echoed
back
from
the
walls
he
howled
continuously
until
the
landlord
quite
distracted
and
concerned
about
the
peace
of
his
neighbors
thrust
bobby
into
the
dark
scullery
at
the
rear
and
bade
him
stop
his
noise
for
fully
ten
minutes
the
dog
was
quiet
he
was
probably
engaged
in
exploring
his
new
quarters
to
find
an
outlet
then
he
began
to
howl
again
it
was
truly
astonishing
that
so
small
a
dog
could
make
so
large
a
noise
a
battle
was
on
between
the
endurance
of
the
man
and
the
persistence
of
the
terrier
traill
was
speculating
on
which
was
likely
to
be
victor
in
the
contest
when
the
front
door
was
opened
and
the
proprietor
of
the
book
hunter
stall
put
in
a
bare
bald
head
and
the
abstracted
face
of
the
that
is
mildly
amused
have
you
to
a
dog
at
your
time
o
life
traill
ay
man
and
it
would
be
all
right
if
the
bit
dog
would
just
tak
to
this
pleasantry
annoyed
a
good
man
who
had
small
sense
of
humor
and
he
remarked
testily
the
barkin
disturbs
my
customers
so
they
canna
the
place
was
a
resort
for
student
laddies
who
had
to
be
saving
of
candles
that
no
right
the
landlord
admitted
sympathetically
a
full
man
eh
what
a
deeference
to
the
warld
if
robbie
burns
had
aye
preferred
a
book
to
a
the
bookseller
refused
to
be
beguiled
from
his
just
cause
of
complaint
into
the
flowery
meads
of
literary
reminiscences
and
speculations
you
stop
that
dog
cleaving
noise
traill
or
i
appeal
to
the
burgh
the
landlord
returned
a
bland
and
smile
you
be
weel
within
your
legal
rights
to
do
it
the
door
was
shut
with
such
a
click
that
the
situation
suddenly
became
serious
bobby
vocal
powers
however
gave
no
signs
of
diminishing
traill
quieted
the
dog
for
a
few
moments
by
letting
him
into
the
outer
room
but
the
swiftness
and
energy
with
which
he
renewed
his
attacks
on
the
door
and
on
the
man
will
showed
plainly
that
the
truce
was
only
temporary
he
did
not
know
what
he
meant
to
do
except
that
he
certainly
had
no
intention
of
abandoning
the
little
dog
to
gain
time
he
put
on
his
hat
and
coat
picked
bobby
up
and
opened
the
door
the
thought
occurred
to
him
to
try
the
gate
at
the
upper
end
of
the
kirkyard
or
that
failing
to
get
into
heriot
hospital
grounds
and
put
bobby
over
the
wall
as
he
opened
the
door
however
he
heard
geordie
ross
whistle
around
the
bend
in
forest
road
hey
laddie
he
called
come
awa
in
a
when
the
sturdy
boy
was
inside
and
the
door
safely
shut
he
began
in
his
most
guileless
and
persuasive
tone

in

was
paid
and
the
tale
told
the
quick
championship
of
the
boy
was
engaged
for
the
gallant
dog
and
geordie
eyes
sparkled
at
the
prospect
of
dark
adventure
bobby
was
on
the
floor
listening
ears
and
eyes
brambly
muzzle
and
feathered
tail
alert
he
listened
with
his
whole
small
excited
body
and
hung
on
the
answer
to
the
momentous
question
is
there
no
a
way
to
smuggle
the
bit
dog
into
the
kirkyard
it
appeared
that
nothing
was
easier
aince
ye
ken
did
traill
know
of
the
internal
highway
through
the
old
cunzie
neuk
at
the
bottom
of
the
row

went
up
the
stairs
on
the
front
to
the
low
timbered
gallery
then
through
a
passage
as
black
as

at
the
end
of
that
one
came
to
a
of
a
window
set
out
on
wooden
brackets
that
hung
right
over
the
kirkyard
wall
from
that
window
bobby
could
be
dropped
on
a
certain
noble
vault
from
which
he
could
jump
to
the
ground
twa
meenits
wark
stout
hearts
sleekit
footstaps
an
the
fearsome
deed

done
declared
geordie
whose
sense
of
the
dramatic
matched
his
daring
but
when
the
deed
was
done
and
the
two
stood
innocently
on
the
brightly
lighted
approach
to
the
bridge
traill
had
his
misgivings
a
business
man
and
he
felt
uneasy
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
a
laddie
who
might
be
boastful

if

about

embarrassed
him
as

a

to
bobby
deep
in
a
blissful
after
dinner
nap
under

settle
the
farmer
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
sat
at
a
table
and
ate
a
frugal
meal
of
bread
and
cheese
as
roughly
dressed
as

in

a
bony

after
having

the
farmer
was
back
in
ten
minutes
with
a
canny
face
that
defied

he
lighted
his
short
dublin
pipe
and
smoked
it
out
before
he

he

that
bobby

at

the
lassie

gin
mither
had
permeeted
traill
asked
him
why
he
had
let
so
valuable
a
man
go
and
the
farmer
replied
at
once
that
he
was
getting
old
and
could
no
longer
do
the
winter
work
to
any
but
a
scotchman
brought
up
near
the
sheep
country
this
would
have
sounded
hard
but
traill
knew
that
the
farmers
on
the
wild
moors
were
themselves
hard
pressed
to
meet
rent
and
taxes
to
keep
a
shepherd
incapacitated
by
age
and
liable
to
lose
a
flock
in
a
was
to
invite
ruin
and
presently
the
man
showed
unwittingly
how
sweet
a
kernel
the
heart
may
lie
under
the
shell
of
sordid
necessity
i
didna
ken
the
auld
man
was

ill

bided
at

fairm
an
ain
time
to
dee
at
as
bobby
unrolled
and
stretched
to
an
awakening
the
farmer
got
up
took
him
unaware
and
thrust
him
into
a
covered
basket
he
had
no
intention
of
letting
the
little
creature
give
him
the
slip
again
bobby
howled
at
the
indignity
and
struggled
and
tore
at
the
stout
wickerwork
it
went
to
traill
heart
to
hear
him
and
to
see
the
gallant
little
dog
so
defenseless
he
talked
to
him
through
the
latticed
cover
all
the
way
out
to
the
cart
telling
him
auld
jock
meant
for
him
to
go
home
at
that
beloved
name
bobby
dropped
to
the
bottom
of
the
basket
and
cried
in
such
a
heartbroken
way
that
tears
stood
in
the
landlord
eyes
and
even
the
farmer
confessed
to
a
sudden
cauld
in
i
gie
to

that
the
bit
lassie

and
he
no
be
permitted
to
live
in
the
kirkyard
i
know
naething
in
this
life
more
pitiful
than
a
masterless
hameless
and
then
to
delay
the
moment
of
parting
with
bobby
who
stopped
crying
and
began
to
lick
his
hand
in
frantic
appeal
through
a
hole
in
the
basket
traill
asked
how
bobby
came
by
his
name
it
was
a
leddy
o
the
neeborhood
o
swanston
she
cam
drivin
by
cauldbrae
i
her
bit
cart
wi
shaggy
shetlands
to
it
an
stapped
at
the
dairy
for
a
drink
o
buttermilk
frae
the
kirn
syne
she
saw
the
sonsie
puppy
loupin
at
auld
jock
heels
bonny
as
a
poodle
but
mair
knowin
the
leddy
gied
me
a
poond
note
for
i
put
up
on
the
seat
she
said
that
noo
she
had
a
smart
hieland
groom
to
match
hieland
steeds
an
she
flicked
the
ponies
wi
whup
syne
the
bit
dog
was
on
the
airth
an
flyin
awa
doon
the
road
like
the
deil
was
after
the
leddy
lauched
an
lauched
an
went
awa
at
the
fut
the
brae
she
was
still
lauchin
an
she
back
the
name
o
bobby
gude
mon
he
left
the
an
aff
to
edinburgh
to
mak
his
fame
an
fortune
i
didna
ken
what
the
leddy
man
she
meant
he
was
like
bobby
here
was
a
literary
flavor
that
gave
added
attraction
to
a
man
who
sat
at
the
feet
of
the
scottish
muses
the
landlord
sighed
as
he
went
back
to
the
doorway
and
he
stood
there
listening
to
the
clatter
of
the
cart
and
horse
and
to
the
mournful
howling
of
the
little
dog
until
the
sounds
died
away
in
forest
road
traill
would
have
been
surprised
to
know
perhaps
that
the
confines
of
the
city
were
scarcely
passed
before
bobby
stopped
protesting
and
grieving
and
settled
down
patiently
to
more
profitable
work
a
human
being
thus
kidnapped
and
carried
away
would
have
been
quite
helpless
but
bobby
fitted
his
mop
of
a
black
muzzle
into
the
largest
hole
of
his
wicker
prison
and
set
his
useful
little
nose
to
gathering
news
of
his
whereabouts
if
it
should
happen
to
a
dog
in
this
day
to
be
taken
from
ye
olde
greyfriars
and
carried
southward
out
of
edinburgh
there
would
be
two
miles
or
more
of
city
and
suburban
streets
to
be
traversed
before
coming
to
the
open
country
but
a
half
century
or
more
ago
one
could
stand
at
the
upper
gate
of
greyfriars
kirkyard
or
hospital
grounds
and
look
down
a
slope
dotted
with
houses
a
village
or
two
and
and
then
cultivated
farms
all
the
way
to
a
burn
and
a
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
this
hillside
was
the
ancient
burghmuir
where
king
james
of
old
gathered
a
great
host
of
scots
to
march
and
fight
and
perish
on
flodden
field
bobby
had
not
gone
this
way
homeward
before
and
was
puzzled
by
the
smell
of
prosperous
little
shops
and
by
the
odors
from
college
campuses
to
the
east
and
from
the
residence
park
of
george
square
but
when
the
cart
rattled
across
lauriston
place
he
picked
up
the
familiar
scents
of
milk
and
wool
from
the
cattle
and
sheep
market
and
then
of
cottage
dooryards
of
turned
furrows
and
of
farmsteads
the
earth
wears
ever
a
threefold
garment
of
beauty
the
human
person
usually
manages
to
miss
nearly
everything
but
the
appearance
of
things
a
few
of
us
are
so
fortunate
as
to
have
ears
attuned
to
the
harmonies
woven
on
the
wind
by
trees
and
birds
and
water
but
the
tricky
weft
of
odors
that
lies
closest
of
all
enfolding
the
very
bosom
of
the
earth
escapes
us
a
little
dog
traveling
with
his
nose
low
lives
in
another
stratum
of
the
world
and
experiences
other
pleasures
than
his
master
he
has
excitements
that
he
does
his
best
to
share
and
that
send
him
flying
in
pursuit
of
phantom
clues
from
the
top
of
the
burghmuir
it
was
easy
going
to
bobby
the
snow
had
gone
off
in
a
thaw
releasing
a
multitude
of
autumnal
aromas
there
was
a
smell
of
birch
and
beech
buds
sealed
up
in
gum
of
berries
clotted
on
the
and
of
balsam
and
spice
from
plantations
of
highland
firs
and
larches
the
babbling
water
of
the
burn
was
scented
with
the
dead
bracken
of
glens
down
which
it
foamed
even
the
leafless
hedges
had
their
woody
odors
and
stone
dykes
their
musty
smell
of
decaying
mosses
and
lichens
bobby
knew
the
pause
at
the
in
the
valley
and
the
mixed
odors
of
many
passing
horses
and
men
there
he
knew
the
smells
of
poultry
and
cheese
at
a
of
hunting
dogs
and
at
a
sportsman
trysting
inn
and
of
grist
and
polluted
water
at
a
mill
and
after
passing
the
hilltop
of
fairmilehead
dipping
across
a
narrow
valley
and
rounding
the
base
of
a
sentinel
peak
many
tame
odors
were
left
behind
at
the
buildings
of
the
large
scattered
farms
there
were
smells
of
sheep
and
dogs
and
barn
yards
but
for
the
most
part
after
the
road
began
to
climb
over
a
high
shoulder
of
the
range
there
was
just
one
wild
tang
of
heather
and
gorse
and
fern
tingling
with
salt
air
from
the
german
ocean
when
they
reached
cauldbrae
farm
high
up
on
the
slope
it
was
entirely
dark
lights
in
the
small
windows
gave
the
outlines
of
a
low
stone
out
of
the
darkness
a
little
wind
blown
figure
of
a
lassie
fled
down
the
brae
to
meet
the
cart
and
an
eager
little
voice
as
clear
as
a
piping
cried
out
hae
ye
got
ma
ain
bobby
faither
ay
lassie
i
fetched
hame
the
farmer
roared
back
in
his
big
voice
then
the
cart
was
stopped
for
the
wee
maid
to
scramble
up
over
a
wheel
and
there
were
sweet
little
sounds
of
kissing
and
muffled
little
cuddlings
under
the
warm
plaid
when
these
soft
endearments
had
been
attended
to
there
was
time
for
another
yearning
may
i
haud
wee
bobby
faither
nae
lassie
a
bonny
bit
bairnie
couldna
haud
in
sma
airms
bobby
a
for
gangin
awa
to
leev
in
a
grand
kirkyaird
wi
auld
a
little
gasp
and
a
wee
sob
and
an
awed
question
is
gude
auld
jock
deid
daddy
bobby
heard
it
and
answered
with
a
mournful
howl
the
lassie
snuggled
closer
to
the
warm
beating
heart
hid
her
eyes
in
the
rough
plaid
and
cried
for
auld
jock
and
for
the
grieving
little
dog
niest
to
faither
an
mither
an
big
brither
wattie
i
auld
jock
the
bairnie
voice
was
smothered
in
the
plaidie
because
it
was
dark
and
none
were
by
to
see
the
reticent
scot
could
overflow
in
tender
speech
his
arm
tightened
around
this
one
little
ewe
lamb
of
the
human
fold
on
cold
slope
farm
he
comforted
the
child
by
telling
her
how
they
would
mak
it
up
to
bobby
and
how
very
soon
a
wee
dog
forgets
the
keenest
sorrow
and
is
happy
again
the
charged
the
cart
with
as
deafening
a
clamor
of
welcome
as
if
a
had
never
happened
before
and
raced
the
horse
across
the
level
the
kitchen
door
flared
open
a
sudden
beacon
to
shepherds
scattered
afar
on
these
upland
billows
of
heath
in
a
moment
the
basket
was
in
the
house
the
door
snecked
and
bobby
released
on
the
hearth
it
was
a
beautiful
dark
old
kitchen
with
a
homely
fire
of
peat
that
glowed
up
to
rafters
soon
it
was
full
of
shepherds
come
in
to
a
supper
of
brose
cheese
milk
and
bannocks
sprawled
and
dozed
on
the
hearth
so
that
the
gude
wife
complained
of
their
being
underfoot
but
she
left
them
undisturbed
and
stepped
over
them
for
tired
as
they
were
they
would
have
to
go
out
again
to
drive
the
sheep
into
the
fold
humiliated
by
being
brought
home
a
prisoner
and
grieving
for
the
forsaken
grave
in
greyfriars
bobby
crept
away
to
a
corner
bench
on
which
auld
jock
had
always
sat
in
humble
he
lay
down
under
it
and
the
little
four
lassie
sat
on
the
floor
close
beside
him
understanding
and
sorry
with
him
her
rough
brother
wattie
teased
her
about
wanting
her
supper
there
on
one
plate
with
bobby
i
wadna
gang
daft
aboot
a
bit
dog
leave
the
bairn
by
lane
commanded
the
farmer
the
mither
patted
the
child
bright
head
and
wiped
the
tears
from
the
bluebell
eyes
and
there
was
a
little
sobbing
confidence
poured
into
a
sympathetic
ear
bobby
refused
to
eat
at
first
but
by
and
by
he
thought
better
of
it
a
little
dog
that
has
his
life
to
live
and
his
work
to
do
must
have
fuel
to
drive
the
throbbing
engine
of
his
tiny
heart
so
bobby
very
sensibly
ate
a
good
supper
in
the
lassie
company
and
grateful
for
that
and
for
her
sympathy
submitted
to
her
shy
petting
but
after
the
shepherds
and
dogs
were
gone
and
the
farmer
had
come
in
again
from
an
overseeing
look
about
the
place
the
little
dog
got
up
trotted
to
the
door
and
lay
down
by
it
the
lassie
followed
him
with
two
small
plump
hands
she
pushed
bobby
silver
veil
back
held
his
muzzle
and
looked
into
his
sad
brown
eyes
oh
mither
mither
bobby
greetin
she
cried
nae
bonny
wee
a
sma
dog

a
human
ay
a
wee

so
i
canna
thole
the
child
fled
to
comforting
arms
in
the
inglenook
and
cried
herself
to
sleep
the
gude
wife
knitted
and
the
gude
mon
smoked
by
the
pleasant
fire
the
only
sound
in
the
room
was
the
ticking
of
the
wag
at
the
wa
clock
for
burning
peat
makes
no
noise
at
all
only
a
pungent
whiff
in
the
nostrils
the
memory
of
which
gives
a
scotch
laddie
abroad
a
fit
of
hamesickness
bobby
lay
very
still
and
watchful
by
the
door
the
farmer
served
his
astonishing
news
in
dramatic
bits
auld
jock
bobby
stirred
at
that
and
flattened
out
on
the
floor
ay
the
lassie
told
that

began
to

that

on

sabbath
that
he
buried
through
all
this
talk
bobby
had
lain
quietly
by
the
door
in
the
expectation
that
it
would
be
unlatched
impatient
of
delay
he
began
to
whimper
and
to
scratch
on
the
panel
the
lassie
opened
her
blue
eyes
at
that
scrambled
down
and
ran
to
him
instantly
bobby
was
up
tugging
at
her
short
little
gown
and
begging
to
be
let
out
when
she
clasped
her
chubby
arms
around
his
neck
and
tried
to
comfort
him
he
struggled
free
and
set
up
a
dreadful
howling
hoots
bobby

the
farmer
picked
the
child
up
on
one
arm
gripped
the
dog
under
the
other
and
the
gude
wife
went
before
with
a
lantern
across
the
dark
farmyard
to
the
when
the
stout
door
was
unlatched
there
was
a
smell
of
warm
animals
of
milk
and
cured
hay
and
the
sound
of
full
contented
breathings
that
should
have
brought
a
sense
of
companionship
to
a
grieving
little
creature
bobby
wullna

grand
times
wi
the
sonsie
doggie
rinnin
an
loupin
on
the
this
argument
was
so
convincing
and
so
attractive
that
the
little
maid
dried
her
tears
kissed
bobby
on
the
head
again
and
made
a
bed
of
heather
for
him
in
a
corner
but
as
they
were
leaving
the
byre
fresh
doubts
assailed
her
he
gang

ye
dinna

snug
the

sic
a

wi

wa
aroond
an
a
roof
to
heid
an
a
floor
to
fut
hoo
could
a
sma
dog
mak
a
way
oot
it
was
a
foolish
notion
bred
of
fond
anxiety
and
so
reassured
the
child
went
happily
back
to
the
house
and
to
rosy
sleep
in
her
little
closet
bed
ah
here
was
a
warm
place
in
a
cold
world
for
bobby
a
little
mistress
and
merry
playmate
was
here
generous
food
and
human
society
of
a
kind
that
was
very
much
to
a
little
farm
dog
liking
here
was
freedom
wide
moors
to
delight
his
scampering
legs
adventures
with
rabbits
foxes
hares
and
and
great
spaces
where
no
ears
would
be
offended
by
his
loudest
longest
barking
besides
auld
jock
had
said
with
his
last
breath
gang
awa
hame
laddie
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
bobby
had
forgotten
that
since
he
remembered
and
obeyed
every
other
order
of
that
beloved
voice
but
there
love
of
liberty
and
the
instinct
of
obedience
even
sank
into
the
abysses
of
the
little
creature
mind
up
to
the
top
rose
the
overmastering
necessity
of
guarding
the
bit
of
sacred
earth
that
covered
his
master
the
byre
was
no
sooner
locked
than
bobby
began
in
the
pitch
darkness
to
explore
the
walls
the
single
promise
of
escape
that
was
offered
was
an
crack
under
the
door
where
the
flooring
stopped
short
and
exposed
a
strip
of
earth
that
would
have
appalled
any
but
a
desperate
little
dog
the
crack
was
so
small
as
to
admit
but
one
paw
at
first
and
the
earth
was
packed
as
hard
as
wood
by
generations
of
trampling
cattle
there
he
began
to
dig
he
came
of
a
breed
of
dogs
used
by
farmers
and
hunters
to
dig
small
burrowing
animals
out
of
holes
a
breed
whose
courage
and
persistence
know
no
limit
he
dug
patiently
steadily
hour
after
hour
enlarging
the
hole
by
inches
now
and
then
he
had
to
stop
to
rest
when
he
was
able
to
use
both
forepaws
he
made
encouraging
progress
but
when
he
had
to
reach
under
the
door
quite
the
length
of
his
stretched
legs
and
drag
every
bit
of
earth
back
into
the
byre
the
task
must
have
been
impossible
to
any
little
creature
not
urged
by
utter
misery
but
skye
terriers
have
been
known
to
labor
with
such
fury
that
they
have
perished
of
their
own
exertions
bobby
nose
sniffed
liberty
long
before
he
could
squeeze
his
body
through
the
tunnel
his
back
bruised
and
strained
by
the
struggle
through
a
hole
too
small
he
stood
trembling
with
exhaustion
in
the
windy
dawn
an
opening
door
a
barking
the
shuffle
of
the
moving
flock
were
signs
that
the
farm
day
was
beginning
although
all
the
stars
had
not
faded
out
of
the
sky
a
little
flying
shadow
bobby
slipped
out
of
the
past
the
and
literally
tumbled
down
the
brae
from
one
level
to
another
he
dropped
several
hundred
feet
in
a
very
few
minutes
and
from
the
clear
air
of
the
breezy
hilltop
to
a
nether
world
that
was
buried
fathoms
deep
in
a
as
white
as
milk
hidden
in
a
deep
fold
of
the
spreading
skirts
of
the
range
and
some
distance
from
the
road
lay
a
pool
made
by
damming
a
burn
and
used
in
the
shearing
season
for
washing
sheep
surrounded
by
brushy
woods
and
very
damp
and
dark
at
other
seasons
it
was
deserted
bobby
found
this
secluded
place
with
his
nose
curled
up
under
a
hazel
thicket
and
fell
sound
asleep
and
while
he
slept
a
nipping
wind
from
the
far
northern
highlands
swooped
down
on
the
mist
and
sent
it
flying
out
to
sea
the
lowlands
cleared
like
magic
from
the
high
point
where
bobby
lay
the
road
could
be
seen
to
fall
by
short
rises
and
long
descents
all
the
way
to
edinburgh
from
its
crested
ridge
and
flanking
hills
the
city
trailed
a
dusky
banner
of
smoke
out
over
the
fishing
fleet
in
the
firth
a
little
dog
can
not
see
such
distant
views
bobby
could
only
read
and
follow
the
of
odors
along
the
way
he
had
begun
the
ascent
to
the
when
he
heard
the
clatter
of
a
cart
and
the
pounding
of
hoofs
behind
him
he
did
not
wait
to
learn
if
this
was
the
cauldbrae
farmer
in
pursuit
certain
knowledge
on
that
point
was
only
to
be
gained
at
his
peril
he
sprang
into
the
shelter
of
a
stone
wall
scrambled
over
it
worked
his
way
along
it
a
short
distance
and
disappeared
into
a
brambly
path
that
skirted
a
burn
in
a
woody
dell
immediately
the
little
dog
was
lost
in
an
unexplored
country
the
narrow
glen
was
musical
with
springs
and
the
low
growth
was
undercut
with
a
maze
of
rabbit
runs
very
distracting
to
a
dog
of
a
hunting
breed
bobby
knew
by
much
journeying
with
auld
jock
that
running
water
is
a
natural
highway
sheep
drift
along
the
lowest
level
until
they
find
an
outlet
down
some
declivity
or
up
some
foaming
steep
to
new
pastures
but
never
before
had
bobby
found
above
such
a
rustic
brook
a
many
chimneyed
and
gabled
house
of
stone
set
in
a
walled
garden
and
swathed
in
trees
today
many
would
cross
wide
seas
to
look
upon
swanston
cottage
in
whose
odorous
old
garden
a
laddie
dreamed
so
many
brave
and
laughing
dreams
it
was
only
a
then
fallen
from
a
more
romantic
history
and
it
had
no
attraction
for
bobby
he
merely
sniffed
at
dead
vines
of
clematis
sleeping
briar
bushes
and
very
live
bright
hedges
of
holly
rounded
a
corner
of
its
wall
and
ran
into
a
group
of
lusty
children
romping
on
the
brae
below
the
very
prettiest
thatch
roofed
and
hamlet
within
many
a
mile
of
edinboro
town
the
bairns
were
lunching
from
grimy
mittened
hands
gypsy
fashion
life
being
far
too
short
and
playtime
too
brief
for
formal
meals
seeing
them
eating
bobby
suddenly
discovered
that
he
was
hungry
he
rose
before
a
laddie
and
politely
begged
for
a
share
of
his
meal
such
an
excited
shouting
of
admiration
and
calling
on
mithers
to
come
and
see
the
bonny
wee
dog
was
never
before
heard
on
swanston
village
green
doors
flew
open
and
bareheaded
women
ran
out
then
the
babies
had
to
be
brought
and
the
old
grandfaithers
and
grandmithers
everybody
and
and
clapped
hands
and
doubled
up
with
laughter
for
a
tempting
bit
held
playfully
just
out
of
reach
bobby
rose
again
and
again
jumped
for
it
and
chased
a
teasing
laddie
then
he
bethought
him
to
roll
over
and
over
and
to
go
through
other
winsome
little
tricks
as
auld
jock
had
taught
him
to
do
to
win
the
reward
all
this
had
one
quite
unexpected
result
a
woman
pounced
upon
bobby
and
captured
him
he
no
an
ordinar
dog
some
leddy
has
lost
her
pet
i
juist
shut
up
an
syne
she
pay
a
shullin
or
twa
to
get
with
a
twist
and
a
leap
bobby
was
gone
he
scrambled
straight
up
the
steep
wall
of
the
glen
where
no
laddie
could
follow
and
was
over
the
crest
it
was
a
narrow
escape
made
by
terrific
effort
his
little
heart
pounding
with
exhaustion
and
alarm
he
hid
under
a
whin
bush
to
get
his
breath
and
strength
the
sheltered
dell
was
windless
but
here
a
stiff
breeze
blew
suddenly
shifting
a
point
the
wind
brought
to
the
little
dog
nose
a
whiff
of
the
acrid
coal
smoke
of
edinburgh
three
miles
away
straight
as
an
arrow
he
ran
across
country
over
roadway
and
wall
plowed
fields
and
rippling
burns
he
scrambled
under
hedges
and
dashed
across
farmsteads
and
cottage
gardens
as
he
neared
the
city
the
hour
bells
aided
him
for
the
skye
terrier
is
keen
of
hearing
it
was
growing
dark
when
he
climbed
up
the
last
bank
and
gained
lauriston
place
there
he
picked
up
the
odors
of
milk
and
wool
and
the
damp
smell
of
the
kirkyard
now
for
something
comforting
to
put
into
his
famished
little
body
a
night
and
a
day
of
exhausting
work
of
anxiety
and
grief
had
used
up
the
last
ounce
of
fuel
bobby
raced
down
forest
road
and
turned
the
slight
angle
into
greyfriars
place
the
lamp
lighter
progress
toward
the
bridge
was
marked
by
the
double
row
of
lamps
that
bloomed
one
after
one
on
the
dusk
the
little
dog
had
come
to
the
steps
of
place
and
lifted
himself
to
scratch
on
the
door
when
the
bugle
began
to
blow
he
dropped
with
the
first
note
and
dashed
to
the
kirkyard
gate
none
too
soon
brown
was
setting
the
little
wicket
gate
inside
against
the
wall
in
the
instant
his
back
was
turned
bobby
slipped
through
after
nightfall
when
the
caretaker
had
made
his
rounds
he
came
out
from
under
the
fallen
of
mistress
jean
grant
lights
appeared
at
the
rear
windows
of
the
tenements
and
families
sat
at
supper
it
was
snell
weather
again
the
sky
dark
with
threat
of
snow
and
the
windows
were
all
closed
but
with
a
sharp
bark
beneath
the
lowest
of
them
bobby
could
have
made
his
presence
and
his
wants
known
he
watched
the
people
eating
sitting
wistfully
about
on
his
haunches
here
and
there
but
remaining
silent
by
and
by
there
were
sounds
of
crying
babies
of
crockery
being
washed
and
the
ringing
of
church
bells
far
and
near
then
the
lights
were
extinguished
and
huge
bulks
of
shadow
of
tenements
and
kirk
engulfed
the
kirkyard
when
bobby
lay
down
on
auld
jock
grave
pellets
of
frozen
snow
were
falling
and
the
air
had
hardened
toward
frost
vi
sleep
alone
goes
far
to
revive
a
little
dog
and
fasting
sharpens
the
wits
bobby
was
so
tired
that
he
slept
soundly
but
so
hungry
that
he
woke
early
and
instantly
alert
to
his
situation
it
was
so
very
early
of
a
dark
winter
morning
that
not
even
the
sparrows
were
out
foraging
in
the
kirkyard
for
dry
seeds
the
drum
and
bugle
had
not
been
sounded
from
the
castle
when
the
milk
and
dustman
carts
began
to
clatter
over
the
frozen
streets
with
the
first
hint
of
dawn
stout
fishwives
who
had
tramped
all
the
way
in
from
the
piers
of
newhaven
with
heavily
laden
creels
on
their
heads
were
lustily
crying
their
caller
soon
fagot
men
began
to
call
up
the
courts
of
tenements
where
fuel
was
bought
by
the
scant
bundle
are
ye
cauld
many
a
human
waif
in
the
tall
buildings
about
the
lower
end
of
greyfriars
kirkyard
was
cold
even
in
bed
but
in
his
thick
underjacket
of
fleece
bobby
was
as
warm
as
a
plate
of
breakfast
toast
with
a
vigorous
shaking
he
broke
and
scattered
the
crust
of
snow
that
burdened
his
shaggy
thatch
then
he
lay
down
on
the
grave
again
with
his
nose
on
his
paws
urgent
matters
occupied
the
little
dog
mind
to
deal
with
these
affairs
he
had
the
long
head
of
the
canniest
scot
wide
and
high
between
the
ears
and
a
muzzle
as
determined
as
a
little
steel
trap
small
and
forlorn
as
he
was
courage
resource
and
purpose
marked
him
as
soon
as
the
door
of
the
caretaker
lodge
opened
he
would
have
to
creep
under
the
fallen
slab
again
to
lie
in
such
a
cramped
position
hour
after
hour
day
after
day
was
enough
to
break
the
spirit
of
any
warm
blooded
creature
that
lives
it
was
an
exquisite
form
of
torture
not
long
to
be
endured
and
to
get
his
single
meal
a
day
at
place
bobby
had
to
watch
for
the
chance
opening
of
the
wicket
to
slip
in
and
out
like
a
thief
the
furtive
life
is
not
only
perilous
it
outrages
every
feeling
of
an
honest
dog
it
is
hard
for
him
to
live
at
all
without
the
approval
and
the
cordial
consent
of
men
the
human
order
hostile
he
quickly
loses
his
and
drops
to
the
pariah
class
already
wee
bobby
had
the
look
of
the
neglected
his
pretty
coat
was
dirty
and
unkempt
in
his
run
across
country
leaves
twigs
and
burrs
had
become
entangled
in
his
long
hair
and
his
legs
and
underparts
were
caked
with
mire
instinctively
any
dog
struggles
to
escape
the
fate
of
the
outcast
by
every
art
he
possesses
he
ingratiates
himself
with
men
one
that
has
his
usefulness
in
the
human
scheme
of
things
often
is
able
to
make
his
own
terms
with
life
to
win
the
niche
of
his
choice
bobby
one
talent
that
was
of
practical
value
to
society
was
his
hunting
instinct
for
every
small
animal
that
burrows
and
prowls
and
takes
toll
of
men
labor
in
greyfriars
kirkyard
was
work
to
be
done
that
he
could
do
for
quite
three
centuries
rats
and
mice
had
multiplied
in
this
old
sanctuary
garden
from
which
cats
were
chased
and
dogs
excluded
every
breeze
that
blew
carried
challenges
to
bobby
offended
nose
now
in
the
crisp
gray
dawn
a
big
rat
came
out
into
the
open
and
darted
here
and
there
over
the
powdering
of
dry
snow
that
frosted
the
kirkyard
a
leap
as
if
released
from
a
spring
and
bobby
captured
it
a
snap
of
his
long
muzzle
a
jerk
of
his
stoutly
set
head
and
the
victim
hung
limp
from
his
grip
and
he
followed
another
deeply
seated
instinct
when
he
carried
the
slain
to
auld
jock
grave
trophies
of
the
chase
were
always
to
be
laid
at
the
feet
of
the
master
gude
dog
eh
but
ye
a
bonny
wee
fechter
auld
jock
had
always
said
after
such
an
exploit
and
bobby
had
been
petted
and
praised
until
he
nearly
wagged
his
crested
tail
off
with
happiness
and
pride
then
he
had
been
given
some
choice
tidbit
of
food
as
a
reward
for
his
prowess
the
farmer
of
cauldbrae
had
on
such
occasions
admitted
that
bobby
might
be
of
use
about
barn
and
dairy
and
traill
had
commended
his
capture
of
prowlers
in
the
but
bobby
was
ower
young
and
had
not
been
put
to
the
vermin
as
a
definite
business
in
life
he
caught
a
rat
now
and
then
as
he
chased
rabbits
merely
as
a
diversion
when
he
had
caught
this
one
he
lay
down
again
but
after
a
time
he
got
up
deliberately
and
trotted
down
to
the
encircling
line
of
old
courtyarded
tombs
there
were
nooks
and
crannies
between
and
behind
these
along
the
wall
into
which
the
caretaker
could
not
penetrate
with
sickle
rake
and
spade
that
formed
sheltered
runways
for
rodents
a
long
low
dog
that
could
flatten
himself
on
the
ground
bobby
squeezed
between
railings
and
pedestals
scrambled
over
fallen
fragments
of
sculptured
urns
trumpets
angels
wings
altars
skull
and
and
latin
inscribed
scrolls
he
went
on
his
stomach
under
holly
and
laurel
shrubs
burdocks
thistles
and
tangled
dead
vines
here
and
there
he
lay
in
such
rubbish
as
motionless
as
the
effigies
careen
on
marble
biers
with
the
growing
light
grew
the
heap
of
the
slain
on
auld
jock
grave
having
done
his
best
bobby
lay
down
again
worse
in
appearance
than
before
but
with
a
stouter
heart
he
did
not
stir
although
the
shadows
fled
the
sepulchers
stood
up
around
the
field
of
snow
and
slabs
and
shafts
camped
in
ranks
on
the
slope
smoke
began
to
curl
up
from
high
clustered
shutters
were
opened
and
scantily
clad
women
had
hurried
errands
on
decaying
gallery
and
reeling
stairway
suddenly
the
castle
turrets
were
gilded
with
pale
sunshine
and
all
the
little
cells
in
the
tall
old
houses
hummed
and
buzzed
and
clacked
with
life
the
university
bell
called
scattered
students
to
morning
prayers
pinched
and
elfish
faces
of
children
appeared
at
the
windows
overlooking
the
kirkyard
the
sparrows
had
instant
news
of
that
and
the
little
winged
beggars
fluttered
up
to
the
lintels
of
certain
casements
where
bairns
scattered
breakfasts
of
crumbs
bobby
watched
all
this
without
a
movement
he
shivered
when
the
lodge
door
was
heard
to
open
and
shut
and
heavy
footsteps
crunched
on
the
gravel
and
snow
around
the
church
juist
fair
silly
on
his
quaking
legs
he
stood
up
head
and
tail
drooped
but
he
held
his
ground
bravely
and
when
the
caretaker
sighted
him
he
trotted
to
meet
the
man
lifted
himself
on
his
hind
legs
his
short
shagged
fore
paws
on
his
breast
begging
attention
and
indulgence
then
he
sprawled
across
the
great
boots
asking
pardon
for
the
liberty
he
was
taking
at
last
all
in
a
flash
he
darted
back
to
the
grave
sniffed
at
it
and
stood
again
head
up
plumy
tail
crested
all
excitement
as
much
as
to
say
come
awa
ower
man
an
leuk
at
the
brave
if
he
could
have
barked
his
meaning
would
have
carried
more
convincingly
but
he
hauded
gab
loyally
and
alas
the
caretaker
was
not
to
be
beguiled
traill
had
told
him
bobby
had
been
sent
back
to
the
hill
farm
but
here
he
was
perseestent
little
rascal
and
making
some
sort
of
bid
for
the
man
favor
brown
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
in
surprised
exasperation
and
glowered
at
the
dog
gang
awa
oot
wi
ye
but
bobby
was
back
again
coaxing
undauntedly
abasing
himself
before
the
angry
man
insisting
that
he
had
something
of
interest
to
show
the
caretaker
was
literally
badgered
and
cajoled
into
following
him
one
glance
at
the
formidable
heap
of
the
slain
and
brown
dropped
to
a
seat
on
the
slab
preserve

a
he
stared
from
the

turned
them
over
with
his
stout
stick
and
counted
them
and
stared
again
bobby
fixed
his
pleading
eyes
on
the
man
and
stood
at
strained
attention
while
fate
hung
in
the
balance

all
this
was
said
in
a
tone
of
astonished
comment
so
of
feeling
that
bobby
tail
began
to
twitch
in
the
stress
of
his
anxiety
when
the
caretaker
spoke
again
after
a
long
puzzled
frowning
it
was
to
express
a
very
human
bewilderment
and
irritation
noo
what
am
i
gangin
to
do
wi
ye
ah
that
was
encouraging
a
moment
before
he
had
ordered
bobby
out
in
no
uncertain
tone
after
another
moment
he
referred
the
question
to
a
higher
court
jeanie
woman
come
awa
oot
a
meenit
wull
ye
a
hasty
pattering
of
feet
on
the
creaking
snow
around
the
kirk
and
there
was
the
neatest
little
peasant
woman
in
scotland
snod
from
her
smooth
frosted
hair
spotless

and
lawn

i
dinna
it
is
very
certain
that
simple
mistress
jean
brown
had
never
heard
of
dick
advice
to
miss
betsy
trotwood
on
the
occasion
when
young
david
copperfield
presented
himself
and
weary
before
his
good
aunt
but
out
of
her
experience
of
wholesome
living
she
brought
forth
the
same
wise
opinion
i
gie
him
a
gude
washin
first
of
a
jamie
he
leuks
like
some
puir
and
she
drew
her
short
gown
back
from
bobby
grateful
attentions
brown
slapped
his
knee
and
nodded
his
grizzled
head
richt
ye
are
it
maist
michty
noo
i
wadna
think
o
that
when
i
was
leevin
as
an
under
gairdener
wi
a
laird
i
argyleshire
i
was
aye
aboot
the
kennels
wi
the
gillies
that
was
lang
syne
the
sma
terrier
dogs
were
aye
washed
i
claes
tubs
wi
warm
water
an
soap
come
awa
the
caretaker
got
up
stiffly
for
such
snell
weather
was
apt
to
give
him
twinges
in
his
joints
in
him
a
youthful
enthusiasm
for
dogs
had
suddenly
revived
besides
although
he
would
have
denied
it
he
was
relieved
at
having
the
main
issue
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
with
this
trespasser
for
a
time
bobby
followed
him
to
the
lodge
at
an
eager
trot
and
he
dutifully
hopped
into
the
bath
that
was
set
on
the
rear
doorstep
brown
scrubbed
him
vigorously
and
bobby
splashed
and
swam
and
churned
the
soapy
water
to
foam
he
scrambled
out
at
once
when
told
to
do
so
and
submitted
to
being
dried
with
a
big
towel
this
was
all
a
delightful
novelty
to
bobby
heretofore
he
had
gone
into
any
convenient
tam
or
burn
to
swim
and
then
dried
himself
by
rolling
on
the
heather
and
running
before
the
wind
now
he
was
bundled
up
ignominiously
in
an
old
flannel
petticoat
carried
across
a
sanded
kitchen
floor
and
laid
on
a
warm
hearth
doon
wi
ye
was
the
gruff
order
bobby
turned
around
and
around
on
the
hearth
like
some
little
wild
dog
making
a
bed
in
the
jungle
before
he
obeyed
he
kept
very
still
during
the
reading
of
a
chapter
and
the
singing
of
a
psalm
as
he
had
been
taught
to
do
at
the
farm
by
many
a
reminder
from
auld
jock
boot
and
he
kept
away
from
the
although
the
walls
of
his
stomach
were
collapsed
as
flat
as
the
sides
of
an
empty
pocket
it
was
such
a
clean
shining
little
kitchen
with
the
scoured
deal
table
chairs
and
cupboard
and
the
firelight
from
the
grate
winked
so
on
pewter
mugs
copper
kettle
plates
and
diamond
panes
that
bobby
blinked
too
flowers
bloomed
in
pots
on
the
casement
sills
and
a
little
brown
skylark
sang
fluttering
as
if
it
would
soar
in
a
gilded
cage
after
the
morning
meal
brown
lighted
his
pipe
and
put
on
his
bonnet
to
go
out
again
when
he
bethought
him
that
bobby
might
be
needing
something
to
eat
what
ye
gie
jeanie
at
the
laird
noo
the
terriers
were
aye
fed
wi
bits
o
livers
an
cheese
an
moor
fowls
eggs
an
havers
jamie
it
no
releegious
to
feed
a
dog
better
than
puir
bairns
he
do
fair
weel
wi
she
set
down
a
plate
with
a
spoonful
of
porridge
on
it
a
cold
potato
some
bread
crusts
and
the
leavings
of
a
broiled
caller
herrin
it
was
a
generous
breakfast
for
so
small
a
dog
but
bobby
had
been
without
food
for
quite
forty
hours
and
had
done
an
amazing
amount
of
work
in
the
meantime
when
he
had
eaten
all
of
it
he
was
still
hungry
as
a
polite
hint
he
polished
the
empty
plate
with
his
pink
tongue
and
looked
up
expectantly
but
the
people
if
they
have
had
little
to
do
with
dogs
can
not
read
such
signs
ye
needna
lick
the
posies
aff
the
wifie
said
good
humoredly
as
she
picked
the
plate
up
to
wash
it
she
thought
to
put
down
a
tin
basin
of
water
bobby
lapped
a
it
so
eagerly
yet
so
daintily
that
she
added
he
a
tyke
he
is
so
noo
we
see
hoo
weel
he
can
in
a
shamefaced
way
he
fetched
from
a
a
strong
little
currycomb
such
as
is
used
on
shaggy
shetland
ponies
with
that
he
proceeded
to
give
bobby
such
a
grooming
as
he
had
never
had
before
it
was
a
painful
operation
for
his
thatch
was
a
stubborn
mat
of
crisp
waves
and
knotty
tangles
to
his
plumy
tail
and
down
to
his
feathered
toes
he
braced
himself
and
took
the
punishment
without
a
whimper
and
when
it
was
done
he
stood
cascaded
with
ripples
nearly
to
the
floor
the
bonny
wee
cried
mistress
jeanie
i
canna
tak
ma
twa
een
aff
ay
he
bonny
by
the
ordinar
it

the
wifie
considered
this
ruefully
jamie
i
was
wishin
ye
didna
hae
to
but
what
she
wished
he
did
not
have
to
do
brown
did
not
stop
to
hear
he
suddenly
clapped
his
bonnet
on
his
head
and
went
out
he
had
an
urgent
errand
on
high
street
to
buy
grass
and
flower
seeds
and
tools
that
would
certainly
be
needed
in
april
it
took
him
an
hour
or
more
of
shrewd
looking
about
for
the
best
bargains
in
a
swarm
of
little
barnacle
and
cellar
shops
to
spend
a
few
of
the
kirk
shillings
when
he
found
himself
to
his
disgust
looking
at
a
nail
studded
collar
for
a
little
dog
he
called
himself
a
doited
auld
fule
and
tramped
back
across
the
bridge
at
the
kirkyard
gate
he
stopped
and
read
the
notice
through
twice
no
dogs
that
was
as
plain
as
thou
shalt
to
the
pious
caretaker
and
trained
servant
it
was
the
eleventh
commandment
he
shook
his
head
sighed
and
went
in
to
dinner
bobby
was
not
in
the
house
and
the
master
of
it
avoided
inquiring
for
him
he
also
avoided
the
wifie
wistful
eye
and
he
busied
himself
inside
the
two
kirks
all
the
afternoon
because
he
was
in
the
kirks
and
the
beautiful
memorial
windows
of
stained
glass
were
not
for
the
purpose
of
looking
out
he
did
not
see
a
dramatic
incident
that
occurred
in
the
kirkyard
after
three
in
the
afternoon
the
prelude
to
it
really
began
with
the
report
of
the
timegun
at
one
bobby
had
insisted
upon
being
let
out
of
the
lodge
kitchen
and
had
spent
the
morning
near
auld
jock
grave
and
in
nosing
about
neighboring
slabs
and
thorn
bushes
when
the
boomed
he
trotted
to
the
gate
quite
openly
and
waited
there
inside
the
wicket
in
such
nipping
weather
there
were
no
visitors
to
the
kirkyard
and
the
gate
was
not
opened
the
music
bells
ran
the
gamut
of
old
scotch
airs
and
ceased
while
he
sat
there
and
waited
patiently
once
a
man
stopped
to
look
at
the
little
dog
and
bobby
promptly
jumped
on
the
wicket
plainly
begging
to
have
it
unlatched
but
the
decided
that
some
lady
had
left
her
pet
behind
and
would
return
for
him
so
he
patted
the
attractive
little
highlander
on
the
head
and
went
on
about
his
business
discouraged
by
the
unpromising
outlook
for
dinner
that
day
bobby
went
slowly
back
to
the
grave
twice
afterward
he
made
hopeful
pilgrimages
to
the
gate
for
diversion
he
fell
noiselessly
upon
a
prowling
cat
and
chased
it
out
of
the
kirkyard
at
last
he
sat
upon
the
he
had
escaped
notice
from
the
tenements
all
the
morning
because
the
view
from
most
of
the
windows
was
blocked
by
washings
hung
out
and
dripping
then
freezing
and
clapping
against
the
old
tombs
it
was
three
when
a
tiny
wizened
face
popped
out
of
one
of
the
rude
little
windows
in
the
decayed
cunzie
neuk
at
the
bottom
of
candlemakers
row
crippled
tammy
barr
called
out
in
shrill
excitement

the

elfin

looked
out
from

low
rear
window
of
the
candlemakers

at
the
top
of
the
row
on
the
stane
by

some
grand

frae
an

tears
suddenly
drowned
the
lassie
blue
eyes
and
ran
down
her
pinched
little
cheeks
nae

admitted
but
for
a
lassie
it
respectable
to
gang
to
a
grand
place
that
was
undeniable
and
the
eager
children
fell
silent
and
tearful
but
oh
necessity
is
the
mother
of
makeshifts
among
the
poor
suddenly
ailie
cried
bide
a
meenit
tammy
and
vanished
presently
she
was
back
with
the
difficulty
overcome
grannie

she
doesna

i
the

ailie
offered
tammy
the
sordid
bargain
shocked
no
feeling
of
these
tenement
bairns
nor
marred
their
pleasure
in
the
adventure
presently
there
was
a
of
crutches
on
the
heavy
gallery
that
fronted
the
cunzie
neuk
and
on
the
stairs
that
descended
from
it
to
the
steep
and
curving
row
the
lassie
draped
a
fragment
of
an
old
plaid
deftly
over
her
thinly
clad
shoulders
climbed
through
the
window
to
the
pediment
of
the
classic
tomb
that
blocked
it
and
dropped
into
the
kirkyard
to
her
surprise
bobby
was
there
at
her
feet
frantically
wagging
his
tail
and
he
raced
her
to
the
gate
she
caught
him
on
the
steps
of
the
dining
room
and
held
his
wriggling
little
body
fast
until
tammy
came
up
it
was
a
tumultuous
little
group
that
burst
in
upon
the
astonished
landlord
barking
fluff
of
an
excited
dog
flying
lassie
in
clattering
big
shoes
and
wee
tapping
tammy
they
literally
fell
upon
him
when
he
was
engaged
in
counting
out
his
money
whaur
did
you
find
him
asked
traill
in
bewilderment
ailie
slipped
a
shy
finger
into
her
mouth
and
looked
to
the
very
much
more
mature
old
crippled
laddie
to
answer
he
was
i
the
sittin
upon
a
stane
by
ainsel
added
ailie
an
no
hidin
ava
it
was
juist
like
he
was
leevin
an
syne
when
i
drapped
oot
o
the
window
he
louped
at
me
so
bonny
an
i
couldna
keep
up
wi
to
the
wonder
of
wonders
it
was
plain
that
bobby
had
made
his
way
back
from
the
hill
farm
and
from
his
appearance
and
manner
as
well
as
from
this
account
it
was
equally
clear
that
some
happy
change
in
his
fortunes
had
taken
place
he
sat
up
on
his
haunches
listening
with
interest
and
lolling
his
tongue
and
that
was
a
thing
the
bereft
little
dog
had
not
done
since
his
master
died
in
the
first
pause
in
the
talk
he
rose
and
begged
for
his
dinner
noo
what
am
i
to
pay
it
took
ane
twa
three
o
ye
to
fetch
ane
dog
a
saxpence
for
the
laddie
a
saxpence
for
the
lassie
an
a
bit
meal
for
while
he
was
putting
the
plate
down
under
the
settle
traill
heard
an
amazed
whisper
he
gien
the
doggie
a
chuckie
the
landlord
switched
the
plate
from
under
bobby
protesting
little
muzzle
and
turned
to
catch
the
hungry
look
on
the
faces
of
the
children
chicken
indeed
for
a
little
dog
before
these
bairns
traill
had
a
brilliant
thought

i
didna
think
to
eat
ma
ain
dinner
i
hae
so
muckle
to

i
canna
eat
it
by
ma
the
idea
of
having
too
much
to
eat
was
so
preposterously
funny
that
tammy
doubled
up
with
laughter
and
nearly
tumbled
over
his
crutches
traill
set
him
upright
again
did
ye
ever
gang
on
a
picnic
bairnies
and
what
was
a
picnic
tammy
ventured
the
opinion
that
it
might
be
some
kind
of
a
cart
for
lame
laddies
to
ride
in
a
picnic
is
when
ye
gang
gypsying

he
suddenly
swung
tammy
up
on
his
shoulder
and
calling
gaily
come
awa
went
out
the
door
through
another
beside
it
and
up
a
flight
of
stairs
to
the
above
a
fire
burned
there
in
the
grate
the
tables
were
covered
with
linen
and
there
were
blooming
flowers
in
pots
in
the
front
windows
patrons
from
the
university
and
the
streets
and
squares
to
the
south
and
east
made
of
this
upper

a
sort
of
club
in
the
evenings
at

in

afternoon

popped
up
so
quickly
the
lassie
caught
her
breath
eneugh

for

of
magic
bobby
had
to
stand
on
the
fourth
chair
to
eat
his
dinner
and
when
he
had
despatched
it
he
sat
up
and
viewed
the
little
party
with
the
liveliest
interest
and
happiness
tammy
ailie
said
when
her
shyness
had
worn
off
it
like
the
grand
tales

when

suddenly
had
a
terrible
cauld
in

that
made
his
eyes
water

are
ye
five
gangin
on
losh
i
thoucht
ye
war
fifty
gangin
on
laughter
saved
the
day
from
overmoist
emotions
and
presently
traill
was
able
to
say
in
a
tone
we
hae
to
tak

to
the
infirmary
an
if
they
canna
mak

ower
ye
get
a
pair
o
braw
crutches
that
are
the
niest
thing
to
gude
legs
an
syne
we
see
if
there
no
a
place
in
heriot
for
a
laddie
that
mak
up
bonny
tales
o
his
ain
in
the
murky
auld
cunzie
now
the
gay
little
feast
was
eaten
and
early
dark
was
coming
on
if
traill
had
entertained
the
hope
that
bobby
had
recovered
from
his
grief
and
might
remain
with
him
he
was
disappointed
the
little
dog
began
to
be
restless
he
ran
to
the
door
and
back
he
begged
and
he
scratched
on
the
panel
and
then
he
yelped
as
soon
as
the
door
was
opened
he
shot
out
of
it
tumbled
down
the
stairway
and
waited
at
the
foot
impatiently
for
the
lower
door
to
be
unlatched
ailie
thin
swift
legs
were
left
behind
when
bobby
dashed
to
the
kirkyard
tammy
followed
at
a
surprising
pace
on
his
rude
crutches
and
traill
brought
up
the
rear
if
the
children
could
not
smuggle
the
frantic
little
dog
inside
the
landlord
meant
to
put
him
over
the
wicket
and
if
necessary
to
have
it
out
with
the
caretaker
and
then
to
go
before
the
kirk
minister
and
officers
with
his
plea
he
was
still
concealed
by
the
buildings
from
the
alcoved
gate
when
he
heard
brown
gruff
voice
taking
the
frightened
bairns
to
task
gie
me
the
dog
an
dinna
ye
tak
him
oot
ony
mair
spierin
the
children
fled
peeping
around
the
angle
of
the
book
hunter
stall
traill
saw
the
caretaker
lift
bobby
over
the
wicket
to
his
arms
and
start
with
him
toward
the
lodge
he
was
perishing
with
curiosity
about
this
astonishing
change
of
front
on
the
part
of
brown
but
it
was
a
delicate
situation
in
which
it
seemed
best
not
to
meddle
he
went
slowly
back
to
the
restaurant
begrudging
bobby
to
the
luckier
caretaker
his
envy
was
premature
brown
set
bobby
inside
the
lodge
kitchen
and
announced
briefly
to
his
wife
the
bit
dog
wull
sleep
i
the
hoose
the
and
he
went
about
some
business
at
the
upper
end
of
the
kirkyard
when
he
came
in
an
hour
later
bobby
was
gone
i
couldna
keep
in
jamie
he
didna
blatter
but
he
greeted
so
sair
to
be
let
oot
an
syne
he
scratched
a
the
paint
aff
the
brown
glowered
at
her
in
exasperation
woman
they
hae
me
up
afore
kirk
sessions
for
brakin
the
rules
an
syne
they
turn
us
oot
i
the
cauld
warld
he
slammed
the
door
and
stormed
angrily
around
the
kirk
it
was
still
light
enough
to
see
the
little
creature
on
the
snowy
mound
and
indeed
bobby
got
up
and
wagged
his
tail
in
friendly
greeting
at
that
all
the
bluster
went
out
of
the
man
and
he
began
to
argue
the
matter
with
the
dog
come
awa
bobby
ye
canna
be
leevin
i
the
bobby
was
of
a
different
opinion
he
turned
around
and
around
thoughtfully
several
times
then
sat
up
on
the
grave
entirely
willing
to
spend
a
social
hour
with
his
new
friend
he
fixed
his
eyes
hospitably
upon
him
brown
dropped
to
the
slab
lighted
his
pipe
and
smoked
for
a
time
to
compose
his
agitated
mind
by
and
by
he
got
up
briskly
and
stooped
to
lift
the
little
dog
at
that
bobby
dug
his
claws
in
the
clods
and
resisted
with
all
his
muscular
body
and
determined
mind
he
clung
to
the
grave
so
desperately
and
looked
up
so
piteously
that
the
caretaker
surrendered
and
there
was
snod
mistress
jeanie
forgetting
her
spotless
gown
and
kneeling
in
the
snow
puir
bobby
puir
wee
bobby
she
cried
and
her
tears
fell
on
the
little
tousled
head
the
caretaker
strode
abruptly
away
and
waited
for
the
wifie
in
the
shadow
of
the
auld
kirk
bobby
lifted
his
muzzle
and
licked
the
caressing
hand
then
he
curled
himself
up
comfortably
on
the
mound
and
went
to
sleep
viii
in
no
part
of
edinburgh
did
summer
come
up
earlier
or
with
more
lavish
bloom
than
in
old
greyfriars
kirkyard
sheltered
on
the
north
and
east
it
was
open
to
the
moist
breezes
of
the
southwest
and
during
all
the
lengthening
afternoons
the
sun
lay
down
its
slope
and
warmed
the
rear
windows
of
the
overlooking
tenements
before
the
end
of
may
the
caretaker
had
much
ado
to
keep
the
growth
in
order
vines
threatened
to
engulf
the
circling
street
of
sepulchers
in
greenery
and
bloom
and
grass
to
encroach
on
the
flower
plots
a
half
century
ago
there
were
no
rotary
lawnmowers
to
cut
off
clover
heads
and
if
there
had
been
one
could
not
have
been
used
on
these
dropping
terraces
so
populous
with
slabs
and
so
closely
set
with
turfed
mounds
and
oblongs
of
early
flowering
annuals
and
bedding
plants
brown
had
to
get
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
with
gardener
shears
to
clip
the
turfed
borders
and
banks
and
take
a
sickle
to
the
hummocks
thus
he
could
dig
out
a
root
of
dandelion
with
the
trowel
kept
ever
in
his
belt
consider
the
spreading
crocuses
and
valley
lilies
whether
to
spare
them
give
a
country
violet
its
blossoming
time
and
leave
a
screening
burdock
undisturbed
until
fledglings
were
out
of
their
nests
in
the
shrubbery
mistress
jeanie
often
brought
out
a
little
old
milking
stool
on
balmy
mornings
and
sat
with
knitting
or
mending
in
one
of
the
narrow
aisles
to
advise
her
in
small
matters
bobby
trotted
quietly
about
sniffing
at
everything
with
the
liveliest
interest
head
on
this
side
or
that
alertly
his
business
learned
in
his
first
summer
in
greyfriars
was
to
guard
the
nests
of
foolish
skylarks
redbreasts
and
wrens
that
built
low
in
lilac
laburnum
and
flowering
currant
bushes
in
crannies
of
wall
and
vault
and
on
the
ground
it
can
not
but
be
a
pleasant
thing
to
be
a
wee
young
dog
full
of
life
and
good
intentions
and
to
play
one
dramatic
part
in
making
an
old
garden
of
souls
tuneful
with
bird
song
a
cry
of
alarm
from
parent
or
nestling
was
answered
instantly
by
the
tiny
tousled
policeman
and
there
was
a
prowler
the
less
or
a
skulking
cat
was
sent
flying
over
tomb
and
wall
his
duty
done
without
noise
or
waste
of
energy
bobby
returned
to
lie
in
the
sun
on
auld
jock
grave
over
this
beloved
mound
a
coverlet
of
rustic
turf
had
been
spread
as
soon
as
the
frost
was
out
of
the
ground
and
a
bonny
briar
bush
planted
at
the
head
then
it
bore
nature
own
tribute
of
flowers
for
violets
buttercups
daisies
and
clover
blossoms
opened
there
and
later
a
spike
or
so
of
wild
foxglove
and
a
knot
of
heather
robin
redbreasts
and
wrens
foraged
around
bobby
unafraid
swallows
swooped
down
from
their
mud
villages
under
the
dizzy
dormers
and
gables
to
flush
the
flies
on
his
muzzle
and
whole
flocks
of
little
blue
titmice
fluttered
just
overhead
in
their
rovings
from
holly
and
laurel
to
newly
tasseled
firs
and
yew
trees
the
click
of
the
wicket
gate
was
another
sort
of
alarm
altogether
at
that
the
little
dog
slipped
under
the
fallen
and
lay
hidden
there
until
any
strange
visitor
had
taken
himself
away
except
for
two
more
forced
returns
and
ingenious
escapes
from
the
sheepfarm
on
the
pentlands
bobby
had
lived
in
the
kirkyard
undisturbed
for
six
months
the
caretaker
had
neither
the
heart
to
put
him
out
nor
the
courage
to
face
the
minister
and
the
kirk
officers
with
a
plea
for
him
to
remain
the
little
dog
presence
there
was
known
apparently
only
to
traill
to
a
few
of
the
tenement
dwellers
and
to
the
heriot
boys
if
his
life
was
clandestine
in
a
way
it
was
as
regular
of
hour
and
duty
and
as
well
ordered
as
that
of
the
garrison
in
the
castle
when
the
boomed
bobby
was
let
out
for
his
midday
meal
at
traill
and
for
a
noisy
run
about
the
neighborhood
to
exercise
his
lungs
and
legs
on
wednesdays
he
haunted
the
grassmarket
sniffing
at
horses
carts
and
mired
boots
edinburgh
had
so
many
shaggy
little
skye
and
scotch
terriers
that
one
more
could
go
about
unremarked
bobby
returned
to
the
kirkyard
at
his
own
good
pleasure
in
the
evening
he
was
given
a
supper
of
porridge
and
broo
or
milk
at
the
kitchen
door
of
the
lodge
and
the
nights
he
spent
on
auld
jock
grave
the
morning
drum
and
bugle
woke
him
to
the
chase
and
all
his
other
hours
were
spent
in
close
attendance
on
the
labors
of
the
caretaker
the
click
of
the
wicket
gate
was
the
signal
for
instant
disappearance
a
scramble
up
the
wall
from
heriot
hospital
grounds
or
the
patter
of
bare
feet
on
the
gravel
however
was
notice
to
come
out
and
greet
a
friend
bobby
was
host
to
the
disinherited
children
of
the
tenements
now
at
the
of
tammy
barr
crutches
he
scampered
up
the
slope
and
he
suited
his
pace
to
the
crippled
boy
in
coming
down
again
tammy
chose
a
heap
of
cut
grass
on
which
to
sit
enthroned
and
play
king
a
grand
new
crutch
for
a
scepter
and
bobby
for
a
courtier
at
command
the
little
dog
rolled
over
and
over
begged
and
walked
on
his
hind
legs
he
even
permitted
a
pair
of
thin
little
arms
to
come
near
strangling
him
in
an
excess
of
affection
then
he
wagged
his
tail
and
lolled
his
tongue
to
show
that
he
was
friendly
and
trotted
away
about
his
business
tammy
took
an
from
his
pocket
to
nibble
and
began
a
conversation
with
mistress
jeanie
i
broucht

took
his
ragged
jacket
and
mended
it
dropped
a
tear
in
an
impossible
hole
and
a
in
the
one
good
pocket
and
by
and
by
the
pale
laddie
slept
there
among
the
bright
graves
in
the
sun
after
another
false
alarm
from
the
gate
she
asked
her
as
she
had
asked
many
times
before
what
ye
do
jamie
when
the
meenister

up
afore
kirk
sessions
for
brakin
the
rule
we
wullna
cross
the
brig
till
we
come
to
the
burn
woman
he
invariably
answered
with
assumed
unconcern
well
he
knew
that
the
bridge
might
be
down
and
the
stream
in
flood
when
he
came
to
it
but
traill
was
a
member
of
greyfriars
auld
kirk
too
and
a
companion
in
guilt
and
brown
relied
not
a
little
on
the
landlord
fertile
mind
and
daring
tongue
and
he
relied
on
useful
bobby
to
plead
his
own
cause
there
nae
denyin
the
doggie
is
takin
in
ways
he
had
twa
gude
hames
fair
thrown
at
heid
but
the
sperity
bit
keeps
to
ain
mind
an
syne
he
usefu
an
hauds
gab
by
the
he
often
reinforced
his
inclination
with
some
such
argument
with
all
their
caution
discovery
was
always
imminent
the
kirkyard
was
long
and
narrow
and
on
rising
levels
and
it
was
cut
almost
across
by
the
low
mass
of
the
two
kirks
so
that
many
things
might
be
going
on
at
one
end
that
could
not
be
seen
from
the
other
on
this
saturday
noon
when
the
heriot
boys
were
let
out
for
the
brown
kept
an
eye
on
them
until
those
who
lived
outside
had
dispersed
when
mistress
jeanie
tucked
her
in
her
belt
and
went
up
to
the
lodge
to
put
the
dinner
over
the
fire
the
caretaker
went
down
toward
candlemakers
row
to
trim
the
grass
about
the
martyrs
monument
bobby
dutifully
trotted
at
his
heels
almost
immediately
a
laddies
led
by
geordie
ross
and
sandy
mcgregor
scaled
the
wall
from
heriot
grounds
and
stepped
down
into
the
kirkyard
that
lay
piled
within
nearly
to
the
top
they
had
a
perfectly
legitimate
errand
there
but
no
mission
is
to
be
approached
directly
by
romantic
boyhood
hist
was
the
warning
and
the
innocent
invaders
feeling
delightfully
lawless
stole
over
and
stormed
the
marble
castle
where
bluidy
mckenzie
slept
uneasily
against
judgment
day
lads
can
do
daring
deeds
on
a
sunny
day
that
would
freeze
their
blood
on
a
dark
and
stormy
night
so
now
geordie
climbed
nonchalantly
to
a
seat
over
the
old
persecutor
crossed
his
stout
bare
legs
filled
an
imaginary
pipe
and
rattled
the
three
farthings
in
his
pocket

then
jauntily
sandy
gie
a

to

door
an
daur
the
auld
hornie
to
come
the
deed
was
done
amid
breathless
apprehensions
but
nothing
disturbed
the
silence
of
the
may
noon
except
the
lark
that
sprang
at
their
feet
and
soared
singing
into
the
blue
it
was
sandy
who
presently
whistled
like
a
blackbird
to
attract
the
attention
of
bobby
there
were
no
blackbirds
in
the
kirkyard
and
bobby
understood
the
signal
he
scampered
up
at
once
and
dashed
around
the
kirk
all
excitement
for
he
had
had
many
adventures
with
the
heriot
boys
at
skating
and
hockey
on
duddingston
lock
in
the
winter
and
tramps
over
the
country
and
out
to
leith
harbor
in
the
spring
the
laddies
prowled
along
the
upper
wall
of
the
kirks
opened
and
shut
the
wicket
to
give
the
caretaker
the
idea
that
they
had
come
in
decorously
by
the
gate
and
went
down
to
ask
him
with
due
respect
and
humility
if
they
could
take
bobby
out
for
the
afternoon
they
were
going
to
mark
the
places
where
wild
flowers
might
be
had
to
decorate
jinglin
geordie
portrait
statue
and
tomb
at

returned
to

at

the

stood
in
and

in
the
open
doorway
with
bobby

little

a

day
for
a
wee
dog

he

gets
a
catechism
of
a

to

landlord
sighed
in
open
envy
when
the
laddies
and
the
little
dog
tumbled
down
the
row
to
the
grassmarket
on
their
gypsying
his
eyes
sought
out
the
glimpse
of
green
country
on
the
dome
of
arthur
seat
that
loomed
beyond
the
university
towers
to
the
east
there
are
times
when
the
heart
of
a
boy
goes
ill
with
the
sordid
duties
of
the
man
straight
down
the
length
of
the
empty
market
the
laddies
ran
through
the
crooked
fascinating
haunt
of
horses
and
jockeys
in
the
street
of
king
stables
then
northward
along
the
fronts
of
quaint
little
handicrafts
shops
that
skirted
castle
crag
by
turning
westward
into
queensferry
street
a
very
few
minutes
would
have
brought
them
to
a
bit
of
buried
country
but
every
expedition
of
edinburgh
lads
of
spirit
of
that
day
was
properly
begun
with
challenges
to
scale
castle
rock
from
the
valley
park
of
princes
street
gardens
on
the
north
i
daur
ye
to
gang
up
was
all
that
was
necessary
to
set
any
group
of
youngsters
to
scaling
the
precipice
by
every
tree
and
ledge
by
every
cranny
and
point
of
rock
stoutly
rooted
hazel
and
thorn
bush
and
clump
of
gorse
they
climbed
these
laddies
went
up
a
quarter
or
a
third
of
the
way
to
the
grim
ramparts
and
came
cautiously
down
again
bobby
scrambled
higher
tumbled
back
more
recklessly
and
fell
head
over
heels
and
upside
down
on
the
daisied
turf
he
righted
himself
at
once
and
yelped
in
sharp
protest
then
he
sniffed
and
busied
himself
with
pretenses
in
the
elaborate
unconcern
with
which
a
little
dog
denies
anything
discreditable
there
were
legends
of
daring
youth
having
climbed
this
cliff
and
laying
hands
on
the
fortress
wall
but
geordie
expressed
a
popular
feeling
in
declaring
these
tales
a
no
ony
laddie
could
gang
a
the
way
up
an
come
doon
wi

no

bobby
couldna
do

noo
we
the
light
brigade
at
balaklava
chairge
the
crimean
war
was
then
a
recent
event
heroes
of
sebastopol
answered
the
summons
of
drum
and
bugle
in
the
castle
and
fired
the
hearts
of
edinburgh
youth
cannon
all
around
them
and
theirs
not
to
reason
why
this
little
band
stormed
out
queensferry
street
and
went
down
hand
under
hand
into
the
fairy
underworld
of
leith
water
all
its
short
way
down
from
the
pentlands
to
the
sea
the
water
of
leith
was
then
a
foaming
little
river
of
mills
twisting
at
the
bottom
of
a
gorge
one
wall
or
the
other
lay
to
the
sun
all
day
so
that
the
way
was
lined
with
a
profusion
of
every
wild
thing
that
turns
green
and
blooms
in
the
lowlands
of
scotland
and
it
was
filled
to
the
brim
with
bird
song
and
water
babble
a
crowd
of
laddies
had
only
to
go
inland
up
this
gorge
to
find
wild
and
tame
bloom
enough
to
bury
jinglin
geordie
all
over
again
every
year
but
adventure
was
to
be
had
in
greater
variety
by
dropping
seaward
with
the
bickering
brown
water
these
waded
along
the
shallow
margin
walked
on
shelving
sands
of
gold
and
where
the
channel
was
filled
they
clung
to
the
rocks
and
picked
their
way
along
dripping
ledges
bobby
missed
no
chance
to
swim
if
he
could
scramble
over
rough
ground
like
a
squirrel
or
a
fox
he
could
swim
like
an
otter
swept
over
the
low
dam
at
dean
village
where
a
valley
was
formed
he
tumbled
over
and
over
in
the
spray
and
was
all
but
drowned
as
soon
as
he
got
his
breath
and
his
bearings
he
struck
out
frantically
for
the
bank
shook
the
foam
from
his
eyes
and
ears
and
barked
indignantly
at
the
saucy
fall
the
white
miller
in
the
doorway
of
the
mill

and
anxious
children
ran
down
from

of

dooryards

bobby
never

a

lesson
at
silver
mills
and
canon
mills
he
came
out
and
trotted
warily
around
the
dam
where
the
gorge
widened
to
a
valley
toward
the
sea
they
all
climbed
up
to

they
ran
southward
to
find
a
castaway
shelter
in
a
hollow
on
the
golf
links
soon
this
was
transformed
into
a
wrecker
den
and
then
into
the
of
a

covenanter

in

for

in

city
of
romantic
history
of
soldiers
of
mountains
and
of
sea
rovings
no
adventure
served
them
five
minutes
and
bobby
was
in
every
one
ah
lucky
bobby
to
have
such
gay
playfellows
on
a
sunny
afternoon
and
under
foot
the
open
country
and
fortunate
laddies
to
have
such
a
merry
rascal
of
a
wee
dog
with
them
to
the
mile
they
ran
bobby
went
five
scampering
in
wide
circles
and
barking
and
louping
at
butterflies
and
whaups
he
made
a
detour
to
the
right
to
yelp
saucily
at
the
sentry
who
paced
before
the
gothic
gateway
to
the
deserted
palace
of
holyrood
and
as
far
to
the
left
to
harry
the
hoofs
of
a
regiment
of
cavalry
drilling
before
the
barracks
at
piershill
he
raced
on
ahead
and
swam
out
to
scatter
the
fleet
of
swan
sailing
or
the
blue
mirror
of
duddingston
loch
the
tired
boys
lay
blissfully
up
the
sunny
side
of
arthur
seat
in
a
thicket
of
hazel
while
geordie
carried
out
a
daring
plan
for
which
privacy
was
needed
bobby
was
solemnly
arraigned
before
a
court
on
the
charge
of
being
a
seditious
covenanting
meenister
and
was
required
to
take
the
oath
of
loyalty
to
english
king
and
church
on
pain
of
being
hanged
in
the
grassmarket
the
oath
had
been
duly
written
out
on
paper
and
greased
with
mutton
tallow
to
make
it
more
palatable
bobby
licked
the
fat
off
with
relish
then
he
took
the
paper
between
his
sharp
little
teeth
and
merrily
tore
it
to
shreds
and
having
finished
it
he
barked
cheerful
defiance
at
the
court
the
lads
came
near
rolling
down
the
slope
with
laughter
and
they
gave
three
cheers
for
the
little
hero
sandy
remarked
ye
wadna
think
noo
sic
a
sonsie
doggie
wad
be
i
the
murky
auld
bobby
had
learned
the
lay
of
the
and
and
jumbled
auld
toon
and
he
led
the
way
homeward
along
the
southern
outskirts
of
the
city
he
turned
up
nicolson
street
that
ran
northward
past
the
university
and
the
old
infirmary
to
get
into
greyfriars
place
from
the
east
at
that
time
one
had
to
descend
to
the
cowgate
and
climb
out
again
bobby
darted
down
the
first
of
the
narrow
wynds
suddenly
he
turned
and
in
bewilderment
then
shot
through
a
sculptured
door
way
into
a
court
and
up
a
flight
of
stone
stairs
the
slamming
of
a
shutter
overhead
shocked
him
to
a
standstill
on
the
landing
and
sent
him
dropping
slowly
down
again
what
memories
surged
back
to
his
little
brain
what
grief
gripped
his
heart
as
he
stood
trembling
on
a
certain
spot
in
the
pavement
where
once
a
long
deal
box
had
rested
what
ails
the
bittie
dog
there
was
something
here
that
sobered
the
thoughtless
boys
come
awa
bobby
at
that
he
came
obediently
enough
but
he
trotted
down
the
very
middle
of
the
wynd
head
and
tail
low
and
turned
unheeding
into
the
roar
of
the
cowgate
he
refused
to
follow
them
up
the
rise
between
magdalen
chapel
and
the
eastern
parapet
of
the
bridge
but
kept
to
his
way
under
the
middle
arch
into
the
grassmarket
by
way
of
candlemakers
row
he
gained
the
kirkyard
gate
and
when
the
wicket
was
opened
he
disappeared
around
the
church
when
bobby
failed
to
answer
calls
brown
grumbled
but
went
after
him
the
little
dog
submitted
to
his
vigorous
scrubbing
and
grooming
but
he
refused
his
supper
without
a
look
or
a
wag
of
the
tail
he
was
gone
again
noo
what
hae
ye
done
he
no
like
ainsel
they
had
done
nothing
indeed
they
could
only
relate
bobby
strange
behavior
in
college
wynd
and
the
rest
of
the
way
home
mistress
jeanie
nodded
her
head
with
the
wisdom
of
women
that
is
of
the
heart
eh
jamie
that
wad
be
whaur
maister
deed
sax
months
and
having
said
it
she
slipped
down
the
slope
with
her
knitting
and
sat
on
the
mound
beside
the
mourning
little
dog
when
the
lads
asked
for
the
story
brown
shook
his
head
ye
spier
maister
traill
he
kens
a
aboot
it
an
syne
he
can
talk
like
a
before
they
left
the
kirkyard
the
laddies
walked
down
to
auld
grave
and
patted
bobby
on
the
head
and
they
went
away
thoughtfully
to
their
scattered
homes
as
on
that
first
morning
when
his
grief
was
new
bobby
woke
to
a
calvinistic
sabbath
there
were
no
rattling
carts
or
hawkers
crying
their
wares
steeped
in
sunshine
the
castle
loomed
golden
into
the
blue
tenement
dwellers
slept
late
and
then
moved
about
quietly
children
with
unwontedly
clean
faces
came
out
to
galleries
and
stairs
to
study
their
catechisms
only
the
birds
were
unaware
of
the
seventh
day
and
went
about
their
melodious
business
and
flower
buds
opened
to
the
sun
in
there
suddenly
broke
on
the
sweet
stillness
that
clamor
of
discordant
bells
that
made
the
wayfarer
in
edinburgh
stop
his
ears
all
the
way
from
leith
harbor
to
the
burghmuir
eight
score
of
warring
bells
contended
to
be
heard
greyfriars
alone
was
silent
in
that
babblement
for
it
had
lost
tower
and
bell
in
an
explosion
of
gunpowder
and
when
the
din
ceased
at
last
there
was
a
sound
of
military
music
the
castle
gates
swung
wide
and
a
kilted
regiment
marched
down
high
street
playing
god
save
the
when
bobby
was
in
good
spirits
the
marching
music
got
into
his
legs
and
set
him
to
dancing
scandalously
the
caretaker
and
his
wifie
always
came
around
the
kirk
on
pleasant
mornings
to
see
the
bonny
sight
of
the
gay
soldiers
going
to
church
to
wee
bobby
these
good
comfortable
everyday
friends
of
his
must
have
seemed
strange
in
their
black
garments
and
their
serious
sunday
faces
and
ah
the
sabbath
must
indeed
have
been
a
dull
day
to
the
little
dog
he
had
learned
that
when
the
earliest
comer
clicked
the
wicket
he
must
go
under
the
and
console
himself
with
the
extra
bone
that
traill
never
failed
to
remember
with
an
hour
respite
for
dinner
at
the
lodge
between
the
morning
and
afternoon
services
he
lay
there
all
day
the
restaurant
was
closed
and
there
was
no
running
about
for
good
dogs
in
the
early
dark
of
winter
he
could
come
out
and
trot
quietly
about
the
silent
deserted
place
as
soon
as
the
crocuses
pushed
their
green
noses
through
the
earth
in
the
spring
the
congregation
began
to
linger
among
the
graves
for
to
see
an
old
burying
ground
renew
its
life
is
a
peculiar
promise
of
the
resurrection
by
midsummer
visitors
were
coming
from
afar
some
even
from
to
read
the
quaint
inscriptions
on
the
old
tombs
or
to
lay
tributes
of
flowers
on
the
graves
of
poets
and
religious
heroes
it
was
not
until
the
late
end
of
such
a
day
that
bobby
could
come
out
of
hiding
to
stretch
his
cramped
legs
then
it
was
that
tenement
children
dropped
from
low
windows
over
the
tombs
and
ate
their
suppers
of
oat
cake
there
in
the
fading
light
when
traill
left
the
kirkyard
in
the
bright
evening
of
the
last
sunday
in
may
he
stopped
without
to
wait
for
lee
the
minister
of
greyfriars
auld
kirk
who
had
been
behind
him
to
the
gate
now
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
with
bobby
ever
in
the
background
of
his
mind
at
such
times
of
possible
discovery
traill
reentered
the
kirkyard
the
minister
was
sitting
on
the
fallen
slab
tall
silk
hat
off
with
brown
standing
beside
him
uncovered
and
miserable
of
aspect
and
bobby
looking
up
anxiously
at
this
new
element
in
his
fate
do
you
think
it
seemly
for
a
dog
to
be
living
in
the
churchyard
brown
the
minister
voice
was
merely
kind
and
inquiring
but
the
caretaker
was
in
fault
and
this
good
english
was
disconcerting
however
his
conscience
acquitted
him
of
moral
wrong
and
his
sturdy
scotch
independence
came
to
the
rescue
gin
a
bit
dog
wha
hands
gab
isna
seemly
thae
pussies
are
the
deil
ain
the
minister
lifted
his
hand
in
rebuke
remember
the
sabbath
day
and
i
see
no
cats
ye
wullna
see
ony
as
lang
as
the

for

a
traill
had
listened
unseen
now
he
came
forward
with
a
gay
challenge
in
broad
scotch
to
put
the
all
but
routed
caretaker
at
his
ease
doctor
i

or

scandalous
organ
i
the
kirk
ah
traill
i
afraid
you
a
sad
irreverent
young
dog
yourself
the
minister
broke
into
a
genial
laugh
man
you
spoiled
a
bit
of
fun
i
was
having
with
brown
who
takes
his
duties
he
sat
looking
down
at
the
little
dog
until
bobby
came
up
to
him
and
stood
confidingly
under
his
caressing
hand
then
he
added
i
have
suspected
for
some
months
that
he
was
living
in
the
churchyard
it
is
truly
remarkable
that
an
active
noisy
little
skye
could
keep
so
still
about
at
that
brown
retreated
to
the
martyrs
monument
to
meditate
on
the
unministerial
behavior
of
this
minister
and
professor
of
biblical
criticism
in
the
university
traill
however
sat
himself
down
on
the
slab
for
a
pleasant
probing
into
the
soul
of
this
courageous
dominie
who
had
long
been
under
fire
for
his
innovations
in
the
kirk
services
i
heard
of
bobby
first
early
in
the
winter
from
a
at
the
medical
mission
in
the
cowgate
who
saw
the
little
dog
master
buried
he
sees
many
strange
sad
things
in
his
work
but
nothing
ever
shocked
him
so
as
the
lonely
death
of
that
pious
old
shepherd
in
such
a
picturesque
den
of
vice
and
ay
he
went
from
my
place
fair
ill
into
the
storm
i
never
knew
whaur
the
auld
man
the
minister

at

by
the
note
of
remorse
in
his
tone
the
missionary
returned
to
the
churchyard
to
look
for
the
dog
that
had
refused
to
leave
the
grave
he
concluded
that
bobby
had
gone
away
to
a
new
home
and
master
as
most
dogs
do
go
sooner
or
later
some
weeks
afterward
the
minister
of
a
small
church
in
the
hills
inquired
for
him
and
insisted
that
he
was
still
here
this
last
week
at
the
general
assembly
i
heard
of
the
wee
highlander
from
several
sources
the
tales
of
his
escapes
from
the

grown
into
a
sort
of
odyssey
of
the
pentlands
i
think
perhaps
if
you
had
not
continued
to
feed
him
traill
he
might
have
remained
at
his
old
nae
i
no
thinking
so
and
i
was
no
willing
to
risk
the
starvation
of
the
bonny
leal

the
stars
came
out

sat
there
telling
the
story
at
mention
of
his
master

the
minister
stooped
and
patted
bobby
and
he
was
thoughtful
all
the
way
to
the
gate
the
matter

not
be
brought
up
in
any
formal

he
called
to
the
caretaker
who
stood
in
the
lodge
door
it
can
not
be
pleasing
to
god
to
see
the
little
creature
restrained
give
bobby
his
liberty
on
the
viii
it
was
more
than
eight
years
after
auld
jock
fled
from
the
threat
of
a
doctor
that
traill
prediction
that
his
tongue
would
get
him
into
trouble
with
the
magistrates
was
fulfilled
and
then
it
was
because
of
the
slip
in
speaking
to
a
boyhood
friend
who
happened
to
be
a
burgh
policeman
many
things
had
tried
the
landlord
of
ye
olde
greyfriars
after
a
series
of
soft
april
days
in
which
lilacs
budded
and
birds
sang
in
the
kirkyard
squalls
of
wind
and
rain
came
up
out
of
the
east
the
smoky
old
town
of
edinburgh
was
so
shaken
and
beaten
upon
and
icily
drenched
that
rattling
finials
and
tiles
were
torn
from
ancient
gables
and
whirled
abroad
rheumatic
pains
were
driven
into
the
joints
of
the
elderly
brown
took
to
his
bed
in
the
lodge
and
traill
was
touchy
in
his
temper
a
sensitive
little
dog
learns
to
read
the
human
barometer
with
a
degree
of
accuracy
rarely
attained
by
fellowmen
and
in
times
of
low
pressure
wisely
effaces
himself
his
rough
thatch
streaming
bobby
trotted
in
blithely
for
his
dinner
ate
it
under
the
settle
shook
himself
dry
and
dozed
half
the
afternoon
to
the
casual
observer
the
wee
terrier
was
no
older
than
when
his
master
died
as
swift
of
foot
and
as
sound
of
wind
as
he
had
ever
been
he
could
tear
across
country
at
the
heels
of
a
new
generation
of
heriot
laddies
and
be
as
fresh
as
a
daisy
at
nightfall
silvery
gray
all
over
the
whitening
hairs
on
his
face
and
tufted
feet
were
not
visible
his
eyes
were
still
as
bright
and
soft
and
deep
as
the
sunniest
pools
of
leith
water
it
was
only
when
he
opened
his
mouth
for
a
tiny
pink
cavern
of
a
yawn
that
the
points
of
his
teeth
could
be
seen
to
be
wearing
down
and
his
nap
was
more
prolonged
than
of
old
at
such
times
traill
recalled
that
the
longest
life
of
a
dog
is
no
more
than
a
fifth
of
the
length
of
days
allotted
to
man
on
that
snarling
april
day
when
only
himself
and
the
flossy
ball
of
sleeping
skye
were
in
the
place
this
thought
added
to
discontent
there
had
been
few
guests
those
who
had
come
in
soaked
and
surly
ate
their
dinner
in
silence
and
discomfort
and
took
themselves
away
leaving
the
freshly
scrubbed
floor
as
mucky
as
a
on
the
moor
late
in
the
afternoon
a
sergeant
risen
from
the
ranks
and
cocky
about
it
came
in
and
turned
himself
out
of
a
dripping
greatcoat
dapper
and
dry
in
his
red
tunic
belt
and
winking
buttons
he
ordered
tea
and
toast
and
dundee
marmalade
with
an
air
of
gay
that
was
no
less
than
a
personal
affront
to
a
man
in
traill
frame
of
mind
trouble
brewed
with
the
tea
that
ailie
lindsey
a
tall
lassie
of
fifteen
but
shy
and
elfish
as
of
old
brought
in
on
a
tray
from
the
scullery
when
this
officer
demanded
price
for
the
little
dog
that
took
his
eye
the
landlord
replied
curtly
that
bobby
was
not
for
sale
the
soldier
was
insolently
amused
that
vera
surprisin
i
aye
thoucht
an
edinburgh
shopkeeper
wad
sell
ilka
thing
he
had
an
tak
the
siller
to
bed
wi
to
keep
snug
the
traill
returned
with
brief
sarcasm
that
his
lairdship
had
been
misinformed
why
wull
ye
no
sell
the
bit
dog
the
man
insisted
the
badgered
landlord
turned
upon
him
and
answered
at
length
after
the
elaborate
manner
of
a
minister
who
lays
his
sermon
off
in
sections
first
he
no
my
dog
to
sell
second
he
a
dog
of
rare
discreemination
and
is
no
like
to
tak
you
for
a
master
third
you
soldiers
aye
have
with
you
a
special
brand
of
impudence
and
fourth
and
last
my
brither
i
no
needing
your
siller
and
i
can
manage
to
do
fair
weel
without
your
as
this
bombardment
proceeded
the
sergeant
jaw
dropped
when
it
was
finished
he
laughed
heartily
and
slapped
his
knee
man
come
an
brak
bread
wi
me
or
i
hae
to
brak
yer
stiff
a
truce
was
declared
over
a
cozy
pot
of
tea
and
the
two
became
at
least
temporary
friends
it
was
such
a
day
that
the
landlord
would
have
gossiped
with
a
gaol
bird
and
when
a
soldier
who
has
seen
years
of
service
much
of
it
in
strange
lands
once
admits
a
shopkeeper
to
equality
he
can
be
affable
and
entertaining
by
the
traill
sketched
bobby
story
broadly
and
to
a
sympathetic
listener
and
the
soldier
told
the
landlord
of
the
animals
that
had
lived
and
died
in
the
castle
parrots
and
monkeys
and
strange
dogs
and
cats
had
been
brought
there
by
regiments
returning
from
foreign
countries
and
colonies
but
most
of
the
pets
had
been
native
dogs
collies
spaniels
and
terriers
and
animals
of
mixed
breeds
and
of
no
breed
at
all
but
just
good
dogs
no
one
knew
when
the
custom
began
but
there
was
an
old
and
cemetery
for
the
castle
pets
when
a
dog
died
a
little
stone
was
set
up
with
the
name
of
the
animal
and
the
regiment
to
which
it
had
belonged
on
it
soldiers
often
went
there
among
the
tiny
mounds
and
told
stories
of
the
virtues
and
taking
ways
of
old
favorites
and
visitors
read
the
names
of
flora
and
guy
and
dandie
of
prince
charlie
and
rob
roy
of
jeanie
and
bruce
and
wattie
it
was
a
merry
life
for
a
dog
in
the
castle
he
was
petted
and
spoiled
by
homesick
men
and
when
he
died
there
were
a
thousand
mourners
at
his
funeral
put
it
to
the
bit
skye
noo
if
he
tak
the
queen
shullin
he
belongs
to
the
the
sergeant
flipped
a
coin
before
bobby
who
was
wagging
his
tail
and
sniffing
at
the
military
boots
with
his
ever
lively
interest
in
soldiers
he
looked
up
at
the
tossed
coin
indifferently
and
when
it
fell
to
the
floor
he
let
it
lie
siller
has
no
meaning
to
a
dog
his
love
can
be
purchased
with
nothing
less
than
his
chosen
master
heart
the
soldier
sighed
at
bobby
indifference
he
introduced
himself
as
sergeant
scott
of
the
royal
engineers
detailed
from
headquarters
to
direct
the
work
in
the
castle
crafts
shops
engineers
rank
high
in
pay
and
in
consideration
and
it
was
no
ordinary
jack
of
all
trades
who
had
expert
knowledge
of
so
many
skilled
handicrafts
traill
respect
and
liking
for
the
man
increased
with
the
passing
moments
as
the
sergeant
departed
he
warned
traill
laughingly
that
he
meant
to
kidnap
bobby
the
very
first
chance
he
got
the
castle
pet
had
died
and
bobby
was
altogether
too
good
a
dog
to
be
wasted
on
a
moldy
auld
kirkyard
and
thrown
on
a
when
he
came
to
die
traill
resented
the
imputation
he
no
be
thrown
on
a
the
door
was
shut
on
the
mocking
retort
hoo
do
ye
ken
he
wullna
and
there
was
food
for
gloomy
reflection
the
landlord
could
not
know
in
truth
what
bobby
ultimate
fate
might
be
but
little
over
nine
years
of
age
he
should
live
only
five
or
six
years
longer
at
most
of
his
friends
brown
was
ill
and
aging
and
might
have
to
give
place
to
a
younger
man
he
himself
was
in
his
prime
but
he
could
not
be
certain
of
living
longer
than
this
hardy
little
dog
for
the
first
time
he
realized
the
truth
of
lee
saying
that
everybody
dog
was
nobody
dog
the
tenement
children
held
bobby
in
a
sort
of
community
affection
he
was
the
special
pet
of
the
heriot
laddies
but
a
class
was
sent
into
the
world
every
year
and
was
scattered
far
not
one
of
all
the
hundreds
of
bairns
who
had
known
and
loved
this
little
dog
could
give
him
any
real
care
or
protection
for
the
rest
bobby
had
remained
almost
unknown
many
of
the
congregations
of
old
and
new
greyfriars
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
him
when
strangers
were
about
he
seemed
to
prefer
lying
in
his
retreat
under
the
fallen
tomb
his
naps
he
usually
took
in
the
lodge
kitchen
and
so
it
might
very
well
happen
that
his
old
age
would
be
friendless
that
he
would
come
to
some
forlorn
end
and
be
carried
away
on
the
dustman
cart
it
might
indeed
be
better
for
him
to
end
his
days
in
love
and
honor
in
the
castle
but
to
this
solution
of
the
problem
traill
himself
was
not
reconciled
sensing
some
shifting
of
the
winds
in
the
man
soul
bobby
trotted
over
to
lick
his
hand
then
he
sat
up
on
the
hearth
and
lolled
his
tongue
reminding
the
good
landlord
that
he
had
one
cheerful
friend
to
bear
him
company
on
the
day
it
was
thus
they
sat
companionably
when
a
burgh
policeman
who
was
well
known
to
traill
came
in
to
dry
himself
by
the
fire
gloomy
thoughts
were
dispelled
at
once
by
the
instinct
of
hospitality
you
fair
wet
man
pull
a
chair
to
the
hearth
and
you
have
a
bit
smut

cam
in
an
belched

in

the
policeman
was
disgusted
and
discouraged
by
three
days
of
wet
clothing
and
he
would
have
to
go
out
into
the
rain
again
before
he
got
dry

occurred
to
him
to

about

scullery
at

of
the
policeman
she
looked
more
than
ever
like
a
scared
rabbit
and
her
hands
shook
when
she
set
the
tray
down
before
him
a
tenement
child
grew
up
in
an
atmosphere
of
hostility
to
uniformed
authority
which
seldom
appeared
except
to
interfere
with
what
were
considered
personal
affairs
the
tea
mollified
the
dour

there
was

seeing

so
well
entertained
and
needing

society
no

bobby
got
up
wagged
his
tail
in
farewell
and
started
toward
the
door
traill
summoned
the
little
maid
and
spoke
to
her
kindly
give
bobby
a
bone
lassie
and
then
open
the
door
for
in
carrying
out
these
instructions
ailie
gave
the
policeman
as
wide
leeway
as
possible
and
kept
a
wary
eye
upon
him
the
officer
duties
were
chiefly
up
on
high
street
he
seldom
crossed
the
bridge
and
it
happened
that
he
had
never
seen
bobby
before
just
by
way
of
making
conversation
he
remarked
i
didna
ken
ye
had
a
dog
ailie
stopped
stock
still
the
cups
on
the
tray
she
was
taking
out
tinkling
from
her
agitation
it
was
thus
policemen
spoke
at
private
doors
in
the
dark
tenements
i
didna
ken
ye
had
the
but
traill
seemed
in
no
way
alarmed
he
answered
with
easy
indulgence
that
no
surprising
there
mony
a
thing
you
dinna
ken
the
landlord
forgot
the
matter
at
once
but
ailie
did
not
for
she
saw
the
officer
flush
darkly
and
having
no
answer
ready
go
out
in
silence
in
truth
the
sarcasm
rankled
in
the
policeman
breast
an
hour
later
he
suddenly
came
to
a
standstill
below
the
clock
tower
of
the
tron
kirk
on
high
street
and
he
chuckled
eh
john
traill
ye
unco
weel
furnished
i
the
heid
but
ane
or
twa
things
ye
dinna
ken
yer
entirely
taken
up
with
his
brilliant
idea
he
lost
no
time
in
putting
it
to
work
he
dodged
among
the
standing
cabs
and
around
the
buttresses
of
giles
that
projected
into
the
thoroughfare
in
the
there
was
a
police
office
in
the
middle
of
the
front
of
the
historic
old
cathedral
that
had
then
fallen
to
its
lowest
ebb
of
fortune
there
the
officer
reported
a
matter
that
was
strictly
within
the
line
of
his
duty
very
early
the
next
morning
he
was
standing
before
the
door
of
traill
place
in
the
fitful
sunshine
of
clearing
skies
when
the
landlord
appeared
to
begin
the
business
of
the
day

a

paper
for
he
thrust
an
document
into
traill
hand
and
took
himself
away
across
the
bridge
fair
satisfied
with
his
conduct
of
an
affair
of
subtlety
it
required
five
minutes
for
traill
to
take
in
the
import
of
the
legal
form
then
a
wrathful
explosion
vented
itself
on
the
unruly
key
that
persisted
in
dodging
the
keyhole
but
once
within
he
read
the
paper
again
put
it
away
thoughtfully
in
an
inner
pocket
and
outwardly
subsided
to
his
ordinary
aspect
he
despatched
the
business
of
the
day
with
unusual
attention
to
details
and
courtesy
to
guests
and
when
in
mid
afternoon
the
place
was
empty
he
followed
bobby
to
the
kirkyard
and
inquired
at
the
lodge
if
he
could
see

or

the
bonny
sun

oot
to
bide
a
traill
left
the
kirkyard
and
went
out
to
george
square
to
call
upon
the
minister
of
greyfriars
auld
kirk
the
errand
was
unfruitful
and
he
was
back
in
ten
minutes
to
spend
the
evening
alone
without
even
the
consolation
of
bobby
company
for
the
little
dog
was
unhappy
outside
the
kirkyard
after
sunset
and
he
took
an
unsettling
thought
to
bed
with
him
here
was
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
indeed
for
a
respected
member
of
a
kirk
and
business
man
to
fry
in
through
the
legal
verbiage
traill
made
out
that
he
was
summoned
to
appear
before
whatever
magistrate
happened
to
be
sitting
on
the
morrow
in
the
burgh
court
to
answer
to
the
charge
of
owning
or
harboring
one
dog
upon
which
he
had
not
paid
the
license
tax
of
seven
shillings
for
all
its
absurdity
it
was
no
laughing
matter
the
municipal
court
of
edinburgh
was
of
far
greater
dignity
than
the
ordinary
justice
court
of
the
united
kingdom
and
of
america
the
civic
bench
was
occupied
in
turn
by
no
less
a
personage
than
the
lord
provost
as
chief
and
by
five
other
magistrates
elected
by
the
burgh
council
from
among
its
own
membership
men
of
standing
in
business
legal
and
university
circles
considered
it
an
honor
and
a
duty
to
bring
their
knowledge
and
responsibility
to
bear
on
the
pettiest
police
cases
it
was
morning
before
traill
had
the
glimmer
of
an
idea
to
take
with
him
on
this
unlucky
business
an
hour
before
the
opening
of
court
he
crossed
the
bridge
into
high
street
which
was
then
as
picturesquely
gothic
and
decaying
and
overpopulated
as
the
cowgate
but
and
all
the
way
up
the
sloping
mile
from
holyrood
palace
to
the
castle
the
ridge
fell
away
steeply
through
rifts
of
wynds
and
closes
to
the
cowgate
ravine
on
the
one
hand
and
to
princes
street
parked
valley
on
the
other
traill
turned
into
the
narrow
descent
of
warriston
close
little
more
than
a
crevice
in
the
precipice
of
tall
old
buildings
on
it
fronted
a
business
house
whose
firm
name
was
known
wherever
the
english
language
was
read
w

from

to

the

even
on

sunny

and
it

and
clattered

the
little

at

in

of

but
he
added
with
scotch
shrewdness
it

the
landlord
agreed
heartily
but
you

much
diluted
and
subdued

brought
sandy
down
from
a
stool
he
called
another
clerk
to
take
his
place
and
made
off
to
find
the
lord
provost
powerful
friend
of
hameless
dogs
traill
hastened
down
to
the
royal
exchange
below
giles
and
on
the
northern
side
of
high
street
less
than
a
century
old
this
municipal
building
was
modern
among
ancient
rookeries
to
high
street
it
presented
a
classic
front
of
four
stories
recessed
by
flanking
wings
around
three
sides
of
a
quadrangular
courtyard
near
the
entrance
there
was
a
row
of
barber
shops
and
any
one
having
business
with
the
city
offices
went
through
a
corridor
between
these
places
of
small
trade
to
the
stairway
court
behind
them
on
the
floor
above
one
had
to
inquire
of
some
uniformed
attendant
in
which
of
the
oaken
halls
the
burgh
court
was
sitting
and
by
the
time
one
got
there
all
the
pride
of
civic
history
of
the
ancient
royal
burgh
as
set
forth
in
portrait
and
statue
and
a
museum
of
antiquities
was
apt
to
take
the
lime
out
of
the
backbone
of
a
man
less
courageous
than
traill
what
a
car
of
juggernaut
to
roll
over
one
small
masterless
terrier
but
presently
the
landlord
found
himself
on
his
feet
and
not
so
ill
at
ease
a
scottish
court
high
or
low
civil
or
criminal
had
a
flavor
all
its
own
law
points
were
threshed
over
with
gusto
but
counsel
client
and
witness
gained
many
a
point
by
ready
wit
and
there
was
no
lack
of
dry
humor
from
the
bench
about
the
burgh
court
for
all
its
stately
setting
there
was
little
formality
the
magistrate
of
the
day
sat
behind
a
tall
desk
with
a
clerk
of
record
at
his
elbow
and
the
officer
gave
his
testimony
briefly
edinburgh
being
quite
overrun
by
stray
and
unlicensed
dogs
orders
had
recently
been
given
the
burgh
police
to
report
such
animals
in
traill
place
he
had
seen
a
small
terrier
that
appeared
to
be
at
home
there
and
indeed
on
the
dog
going
out
traill
had
called
a
servant
lassie
to
fetch
a
bone
and
to
open
the
door
for
him
he
noticed
that
the
animal
wore
no
collar
and
felt
it
his
duty
to
report
the
matter
by
the
time
traill
was
called
to
answer
to
the
charge
a
number
of
curious
idlers
had
gathered
on
the
back
benches
he
admitted
his
name
and
address
but
denied
that
he
either
owned
or
was
harboring
a
dog
the
magistrate
fixed
a
cold
eye
upon
him
and
asked
if
he
meant
to
contradict
the
testimony
of
the
officer
nae
your
honor
and
he
might
have
seen
the
same
thing
ony
of
the
past
eight
and
a
half
years
but
the
bit
terrier
is
no
my
ain
suddenly
the
memory
of
the
stormy
night
the
sick
old
man
and
the
pathos
of
his
renunciation
of
the
only
beating
heart
in
the
world
that
loved
him
bobby
isna
ma
ain
dog
swept
over
the
remorseful
landlord
he
was
filled
with
a
fierce
championship
of
the
wee
highlander
whose
loyalty
to
that
dead
master
had
brought
him
to
this
strait
to
the
magistrate
traill
head
had
the
effect
of
defiance
and
brought
a
sharp
rebuke
do
split
hairs
traill
you
are
wasting
the
time
of
the
court
you
admit
feeding
the
dog
who
is
his
master
and
where
does
he
sleep
his
master
is
in
his
grave
in
auld
greyfriars
kirkyard
and
the
dog
has
aye
slept
there
on
the
the
magistrate
leaned
over
his
desk
man
no
dog
could
sleep
in
the
open
for
one
winter
in
this
climate
are
you
fond
of
romancing
traill
no
so
overfond
your
honor
the
dog
is
of
the
subarctic
breed
of
skye
terriers
the
kind
with
a
thick
of
fleece
and
a
weather
thatch
that
turns
rain
like
a
crofter
cottage
there
should
be
witnesses
to
such
an
extraordinary
story
the
dog
could
not
have
lived
in
this
strictly
guarded
churchyard
without
the
consent
of
those
in
the
magistrate
was
plainly
annoyed
and
skeptical
and
traill
felt
the
sting
of
it
ay
the
caretaker
has
been
his
gude
friend
but
brown
is
ill
of
rheumatism
and
can
no
come
out
nae
doubt
if
necessary
his
deposeetion
could
be
permission
for
the
bit
dog
to
live
in
the
kirkyard
was
given
by
the
meenister
of
greyfriars
auld
kirk
but
doctor
lee
is
in
failing
health
and
has
gone
to
the
south
of
france
the
tenement
children
and
the
heriot
laddies
have
aye
made
a
pet
of
bobby
but
they
would
no
be
competent
you
should
have
counsel
there
are
some
legal
difficulties
i
no
needing
a
lawyer
the
law
in
sic
a
matter
can
no
be
so
complicated
and
i
have
a
tongue
in
my
ain
head
that
has
aye
served
me
your
the
magistrate
smiled
and
the
spectators
moved
to
the
nearer
benches
to
enjoy
this
racy
man
the
room
began
to
fill
by
that
kind
of
telepathy
that
causes
crowds
to
gather
around
the
human
drama
one
man
stood
unnoticed
in
the
doorway
traill
went
on
quietly
if
the
court
permits
me
to
do
so
i
shall
be
glad
to
pay
for
license
but
i
thinking
that
carries
responsibeelity
for
the
bit
you
are
quite
right
traill
you
would
have
to
assume
responsibility
masterless
dogs
have
become
a
serious
nuisance
in
the
i
could
no
tak
responsibeelity
the
dog
is
no
with
me
more
than
a
couple
of
hours
out
of
the
i
understand
that
most
of
his
time
is
spent
in
the
kirkyard
in
usefu
ways
but
i
could
no
be
but
why
have
you
fed
him
for
so
many
years
was
his
master
a
friend
nae
just
a
customer
your
honor
a
simple
auld
shepherd
who
ate
his
dinner
in
my
place
he
aye
had
the
bit
dog
with
him
and
i
was
the
last
man
to
see
the
auld
body
before
he
went
awa
to
his
meeserable
death
in
a
cowgate
wynd
bobby
came
to
me
near
starved
to
be
fed
two
days
after
his
master
burial
i
was
by
the
wee
highlander
leal
and
that
was
all
the
landlord
would
say
he
had
no
mind
to
wear
his
heart
upon
his
sleeve
for
this
idle
crowd
to
gape
at
after
a
moment
the
magistrate
spoke
warmly
it
appears
then
that
the
payment
of
the
license
could
not
be
accepted
from
you
your
humanity
is
commendable
traill
but
technically
you
are
in
fault
the
minimum
fine
should
be
imposed
and
at
this
utterly
conclusion
traill
seemed
to
gather
his
lean
shoulders
together
for
a
spring
and
his
gray
eyes
narrowed
to
blades
with
due
respect
to
your
honor
i
must
tak
an
appeal
against
sic
a
deceesion
to
the
lord
provost
and
a
the
magistrates
and
then
to
the
court
of
you
would
get
scant
attention
traill
the
higher
judiciary
have
more
important
business
than
reviewing
dog
cases
you
would
be
laughed
out
of
the
dry
tone
stung
him
to
instant
retort
and
in
gude
company
be
fifty
years
syne
lord
erskine
was
laughed
down
in
parliament
for
proposing
to
give
legal
protection
to
dumb
animals
but
we
getting
a
bit
more
tut
tut
traill
you
are
making
far
too
much
of
a
small
it
no
a
sma
matter
to
be
entered
in
the
records
of
the
burgh
court
as
a
petty
and
if
i
continued
to
feed
the
dog
i
would
be
in
contempt
of
the
magistrate
was
beginning
to
feel
badgered
the
fine
carries
the
interdiction
with
it
traill
if
you
are
asking
for
it
was
no
for
information
but
just
to
mak
plain
my
ain
line
of
conduct
i
no
intending
to
abandon
the
dog
i
am
commended
here
for
my
humanity
but
the
bit
dog
i
must
let
starve
for
a
instantly
as
the
magistrate
half
rose
from
the
bench
the
landlord
saw
that
he
had
gone
too
far
and
put
the
court
on
the
defensive
in
an
easy
conversational
tone
as
if
unaware
of
the
point
he
had
scored
he
asked
if
he
might
address
his
accuser
on
a
personal
matter
we
knew
each
other
weel
as
laddies
davie
when
you
in
my
neeborhood
again
on
a
wet
day
come
in
and
dry
yoursel
by
my
fire
and
tak
another
cup
kindness
for
auld
lang
syne
you
be
all
the
better
man
for
a
lesson
in
morals
the
bit
dog
can
give
you
no
to
bite
the
hand
that
feeds
the
policeman
turned
purple
a
ripple
of
merriment
ran
through
the
room
the
magistrate
put
his
hand
up
to
his
mouth
and
the
clerk
began
to
drop
pens
before
silence
was
restored
a
messenger
laddie
ran
up
with
a
note
for
the
bench
the
magistrate
read
it
with
a
look
of
relief
and
nodded
to
the
man
who
had
been
listening
from
the
doorway
but
who
disappeared
at
once
the
case
is
ordered
continued
the
defendant
will
be
given
time
to
secure
witnesses
and
notified
when
to
appear
the
next
case
is
somewhat
dazed
by
this
sudden
turn
and
annoyed
by
the
delayed
settlement
of
the
affair
traill
hastened
from
the
as
he
gained
the
street
he
was
overtaken
by
the
messenger
with
a
second
note
and
there
was
a
still
more
surprising
turn
that
sent
the
landlord
off
up
swarming
high
street
across
the
bridge
and
on
to
his
snug
little
place
of
business
with
the
face
and
the
heart
of
a
when
bobby
draggled
by
three
days
of
wet
weather
came
in
for
his
dinner
traill
scanned
him
critically
and
in
some
perplexity
at
the
end
of
the
day
work
as
ailie
was
dropping
her
quaint
curtsy
and
giving
her
adored
employer
a
shy
gude
nicht
he
had
a
sudden
thought
that
made
him
call
her
back

a

there

getting
to
look

a
poor
aboot
dog
have
him
at
the
kirkyard
gate
at
a
quarter
to
eight
the
morn
looking
like
a
leddy
pet
and
i
dance
a
highland
fling
at
your
are
ye
gangin
to
tak
bobby
on
a
picnic
maister
traill
he
answered
with
a
mock
solemnity
and
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
that
mystified
the
little
maid
nae
lassie
i
going
to
tak
him
to
a
meeting
in
a
braw
ix
when
ailie
wanted
to
get
up
unusually
early
in
the
morning
she
made
use
of
tammy
for
an
a
crippled
laddie
who
must
leevin
wi
heid
can
waste
no
moment
of
daylight
and
in
the
ancient
buildings
around
greyfriars
the
maximum
of
daylight
was
to
be
had
only
by
those
able
and
willing
to
climb
to
the
gables
tammy
having
to
live
on
the
lowest
darkest
floor
of
all
used
the
kirkyard
for
a
study
by
special
indulgence
of
the
caretaker
whenever
the
weather
permitted
from
a
window
he
dropped
his
books
and
his
crutches
over
the
wall
then
by
clasping
his
arms
around
a
broken
shaft
that
blocked
the
casement
he
swung
himself
out
and
scrambled
down
into
an
enclosed
vault
yard
there
he
kept
hidden
mistress
jeanie
milking
stool
for
a
seat
and
a
served
as
well
for
the
laddie
to
do
his
sums
upon
as
it
had
for
the
tearful
signing
of
the
covenant
more
than
two
hundred
years
before
bobby
as
host
greeted
tammy
with
cordial
friskings
and
waggings
saw
him
settled
to
his
tasks
and
then
went
briskly
about
his
own
interrupted
business
of
searching
out
marauders
many
a
spring
dawn
the
quiet
little
boy
and
the
swift
and
silent
little
dog
had
the
shadowy
garden
all
to
themselves
and
it
was
for
them
the
and
skylarks
gave
their
choicest
concerts
on
that
morning
when
the
rising
sun
gilded
the
castle
turrets
and
flashed
back
from
the
many
beautiful
windows
of
heriot
hospital
tammy
bundled
his
books
under
the
of
mistress
jean
grant
went
over
to
the
rear
of
the
guildhall
at
the
top
of
the
row
and
threw
a
handful
of
gravel
up
to
ailie
window
because
of
a
grandmither
ailie
too
dwelt
on
a
low
level
her
eager
little
face
lighted
by
blue
eyes
popped
out
with
the
surprising
suddenness
of
the
manikins
in
a
show
in
juist
ane
meenit
tammy
she
whispered
no
to
wauken
the
it
was
in
so
very
short
a
minute
that
the
lassie
climbed
out
onto
the
classic
pediment
of
a
tomb
and
dropped
into
the
kirkyard
that
her
toilet
was
uncompleted
tammy
buttoned
her
cotton
gown
at
the
back
and
she
sat
on
a
slab
to
lace
her
shoes
if
the
fun
of
giving
bobby
his
bath
was
to
be
enjoyed
to
the
full
there
must
be
no
unnecessary
delay
this
consideration
led
tammy
to
observe
ye
no
needin
to
comb
yer
hair
ailie
it
leuks
bonny
in
truth
ailie
was
one
of
those
fortunate
lassies
whose
crinkly
mop
really
looked
best
when
in
some
disorder
and
of
that
advantage
the
little
maid
was
well
aware
i
ken
a
that
tammy
i
aye
gie
it
a
lick
or
twa
wi
a
comb
the
nicht
afore
ca
the
wee
bobby
fully
understood
that
he
was
wanted
for
some
serious
purpose
but
it
was
a
fresh
morning
of
dew
and
he
apparently
was
in
the
highest
of
spirits
so
he
gave
ailie
a
chase
over
the
sparkling
grass
and
under
the
showery
shrubbery
when
he
dropped
at
last
on
auld
jock
grave
tammy
captured
him
the
little
dog
could
always
be
caught
there
in
a
caressable
state
of
exhaustion
or
meditation
for
sooner
or
later
he
returned
to
the
spot
from
every
bit
of
work
or
play
no
one
would
have
known
it
for
a
place
of
burial
at
all
brown
knew
it
only
by
the
rose
bush
at
its
head
and
by
bobby
haunting
it
for
the
mound
had
sunk
to
the
general
level
of
the
terrace
on
which
it
lay
and
spreading
crocuses
poked
their
purple
and
gold
noses
through
the
crisp
spring
turf
but
for
the
wee
guardian
dog
the
man
who
lay
beneath
had
long
lost
what
little
identity
he
had
ever
possessed
now
as
the
three
lay
there
the
lassie
as
flushed
and
damp
as
some
bobby
panting
and
submitting
to
a
petting
tammy
took
the
little
dog
muzzle
between
his
thin
hands
parted
the
veil
and
looked
into
the
soft
brown
eyes
leak
ailie
bobby
wantin
somethin
an
is
juist
haudin
it
was
true
for
all
his
gaiety
in
play
and
his
energy
at
work
eyes
had
ever
a
patient
wistful
look
not
unlike
the
crippled
laddie
ah
who
can
say
that
it
did
not
require
as
much
courage
and
gallant
bravado
on
the
part
of
that
small
bereft
creature
to
enable
him
to
live
at
all
as
it
did
for
tammy
to
face
his
handicapped
life
and
no
to
remember
bad
legs
in
the
bath
on
the
rear
steps
of
the
lodge
bobby
swam
and
splashed
and
scattered
foam
with
his
excited
tail
he
would
not
stand
still
to
be
groomed
but
wriggled
and
twisted
and
leaped
upon
the
children
putting
his
shaggy
wet
paws
roguishly
in
their
faces
but
he
stood
there
at
last
after
the
jolliest
romp
in
which
the
old
kirkyard
rang
with
laughter
and
oh
so
bonny
in
his
rippling
coat
of
dark
silver
no
sooner
was
he
released
than
he
dashed
around
the
kirk
and
back
again
bringing
his
latest
bone
in
his
mouth
to
his
scratching
on
the
stone
sill
for
he
had
been
taught
not
to
scratch
on
the
panel
the
door
was
opened
by
snod
and
smiling
mistress
jeanie
who
invited
these
slum
bairns
into
such
a
cozy
spotless
kitchen
as
was
not
possible
in
the
tenements
brown
sat
by
the
hearth
bundled
in
blue
and
white
blankets
of
wonderfully
blocked
country
weaving
bobby
put
his
fore
paws
on
the
caretaker
chair
and
laid
his
precious
bone
in
the
man
lap
eh
ye
takin
bit
rascal
loup
bobby
jumped
to
the
patted
knee
turned
around
and
around
on
the
soft
bed
that
invited
him
licked
the
beaming
old
face
to
show
his
sympathy
and
friendliness
and
jumped
down
again
brown
sighed
because
bobby
steadily
but
amiably
refused
to
be
anybody
the
caretaker
turned
to
the
admiring
children

in

kirkyard

james
brown
wasna
gangin
to
dee
before
his
time
came
at
any
rate
in
his
youth
as
on
a
highland
estate
he
had
learned
to
play
the
piccolo
flute
and
lately
he
had
revived
the
pastoral
art
of
piping
just
because
it
went
so
well
with
bobby
delighted
legs
to
the
sonsie
air
of
bonnie
dundee
bobby
hopped
and
stepped
and
louped
and
he
turned
about
on
his
hind
feet
his
shagged
fore
paws
drooped
on
his
breast
as
daintily
as
the
hands
in
the
portraits
of
early
victorian
ladies
the
fire
burned
cheerily
in
the
polished
grate
and
winked
on
every
shining
thing
in
the
room
primroses
bloomed
in
the
casement
the
skylark
fluttered
up
and
sang
in
its
cage
the
fife
whistled
as
gaily
as
a
blackbird
and
the
little
dog
danced
with
a
comic
clumsiness
that
made
them
all
double
up
with
laughter
the
place
was
so
full
of
brightness
and
of
kind
and
merry
hearts
that
there
was
room
for
nothing
else
not
one
of
them
dreamed
that
the
shadow
of
the
law
was
even
then
over
this
useful
and
lovable
little
dog
head
a
glance
at
the
clock
reminded
ailie
that
traill
might
be
waiting
for
bobby
curious
about
the
mystery
the
children
took
the
little
dog
down
to
the
gate
happily
they
were
sobered
however
when
traill
appeared
looking
very
grand
in
his
sabbath
clothes
he
inspected
bobby
all
over
with
anxious
scrutiny
and
gave
each
of
the
bairns
a
but
he
had
no
blithe
greeting
for
them
much
preoccupied
he
went
off
at
once
with
the
animated
little
muff
of
a
dog
at
his
heels
in
truth
traill
was
thinking
about
how
he
might
best
plead
bobby
cause
with
the
lord
provost
the
note
that
was
handed
him
on
leaving
the
burgh
court
the
day
before
had
read
meet
me
at
the
regent
tomb
in
giles
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
bring
the
wee
highlander
with
on
the
first
reading
the
landlord
spirits
had
risen
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
cause
owing
to
his
previous
depression
but
after
all
the
appointment
had
no
official
character
since
the
regent
tomb
in
giles
had
long
been
a
sort
of
town
pump
for
the
retailing
of
gossip
and
for
the
transaction
of
trifling
affairs
of
all
sorts
the
fate
of
this
little
dog
was
a
small
matter
indeed
and
so
it
might
be
thought
fitting
by
the
powers
that
be
that
it
should
be
decided
at
the
regent
tomb
rather
than
in
the
burgh
court
to
the
children
who
watched
from
the
kirkyard
gate
until
traill
and
bobby
were
hidden
by
the
buildings
on
the
bridge
it
was
no
canny
the
busy
landlord
lived
mostly
in
and
big
white
apron
ready
to
lend
a
hand
in
the
rush
hours
and
he
never
was
known
to
put
on
his
black
coat
and
tall
hat
on
a
except
to
attend
a
funeral
however
there
was
the
day
work
to
be
done
tammy
had
a
lesson
still
to
get
and
returned
to
the
kirkyard
and
ailie
ran
up
to
the
on
the
step
she
collided
with
a
red
headed
young
man
who
asked
for
traill
he
isna
the
shy
lassie
was
made
almost
speechless
by
recognizing
in
this
neat
clerk
an
old
heriot
boy
once
as
poor
as
herself
do
you
wark
for
him
lassie
weel
do
you
know
how
he
cam
out
in
the
burgh
court
about
the
bit
dog
there
was
only
one
bit
dog
in
the
world
to
ailie
wild
eyed
with
alarm
at
mention
of
the
burgh
court
in
connection
with
that
beloved
little
pet
she
stammered
it
it
no
a
coort
he
gaed
to
maister

bobby
awa
to

nodded
his
head
ay
that

office

traill
i
sent
the
lord
provost
and
if
needing
a
witness
to
ca
on
sandy
ailie
stared
after
him
with
frightened
eyes
into
her
mind
flashed
that
ominous
remark
of
the
policeman
two
days
before
i
didna
ken
ye
had
a
dog
john
she
overtook
sandy
in

of
the
sheriff

on

what
what

dogs

seven
shullings
gude
day
lassie
i
fair
sandy
was
not
really
alarmed
about
bobby
since
the
resourceful
traill
had
taken
up
his
cause
and
he
had
no
idea
of
the
panic
of
grief
and
fright
that
overwhelmed
this
forlorn
child
seven
shullings
it
was
an
enormous
sum
to
the
tenement
bairn
whose
grandmither
knitted
and
knitted
in
a
dimly
lighted
room
and
hoarded
halfpennies
and
farthings
to
save
herself
from
pauper
burial
seven
shullings
would
pay
a
month
rent
for
any
one
of
the
crowded
rooms
in
which
a
family
lived
ailie
herself
an
untrained
lassie
who
scarcely
knew
the
use
of
a
was
overpaid
by
generous
traill
at
sixpence
a
day
seven
shullings
to
permit
one
little
dog
to
live
it
did
not
occur
to
ailie
that
this
was
a
sum
traill
could
easily
pay
no
onybody
at
all
had
seven
shullings
all
at
once
but
oh
everybody
had
pennies
and
halfpennies
and
farthings
and
she
and
tammy
together
had
a
sixpence
darting
back
to
the
gate
to
catch
the
laddie
before
he
could
be
off
to
school
she
ran
straight
into
the
policeman
who
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
wicket
he
eyed
her
sharply

she

from
an
officer
of

in

against

she
could
not

that
this
officer
was
suffering
a
bad
attack
of
shame
for
his
shabby
part
in
the
affair
satisfied
that
the
little
dog
really
did
live
in
the
kirkyard
he
turned
back
to
the
bridge
when
tammy
came
out
presently
he
found
ailie
crumpled
up
in
a
limp
little
heap
in
the
gateway
alcove
in
a
moment
the
tale
of
bobby
peril
was
told
the
laddie
dropped
his
books
and
his
crutches
on
the
pavement
and
his
head
in
his
helpless
arms
and
cried
he
had
small

this
dreadful
thought
spurred
them
to
instant
action
by
way
of
mutual
encouragement
they
went
together
through
the
sculptured
doorway
that
bore
the
arms
of
the
ancient
guild
of
the
candlemakers
on
the
lintel
and
into

in

on
folk
who
did
not
know
bobby
for
it
would
take
too
long
to
explain
him
but
alas
they
soon
discovered
that
maist
ilka
body
did
not
know
the
little
dog
as
they
had
so
confidently
supposed
he
was
sure
to
be
known
only
in
the
rooms
at
the
rear
that
overlooked
the
kirkyard
and
as
one
went
upward
his
identity
became
less
and
less
distinct
he
was
such
a
wee
wee
canny
terrier
and
so
many
of
the
windows
had
their
views
constantly
shut
out
by
washings
around
the
inner
courts
where
unkempt
women
brought
every
sort
of
work
out
to
the
light
on
the
galleries
and
mended
worthless
rags
gossiped
and
nursed
their
babies
on
the
stairs
bobby
had
sometimes
been
heard
of
but
almost
never
seen
children
often
knew
him
where
their
elders
did
not
by
the
time
ailie
and
tammy
had
worked
swiftly
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
row
other
children
began
to
follow
them
moved
by
the
peril
of
the
little
dog
to
sympathy
and
eager
sacrifice
bide
a
wee
ailie
cried
one
running
to
overtake
the
lassie
a
penny
i
was
gangin
for
milk
for
the
porridge
we
can
do
the
and
there
was
the
money
for
the
broth
bone
and
the
farthing
that
would
have
filled
the
evening
pipe
and
the
for
the
grandmither
tea
it
was
the
story
of
the
poor
helping
the
poor
the
progress
of
ailie
and
tammy
through
the
tenements
was
like
that
of
the
piper
through
hamelin
the
children
gathered
and
gathered
and
followed
at
their
heels
until
a
curiously
quiet
mob
of
threescore
or
more
crouched
in
the
court
of
the
old
hall
of
the
knights
of
john
in
the
grassmarket
to
count
the
many
copper
coins
in
woolen
bonnet
five
shullin
ninepence
an
a
tammy
announced
and
then
after
calculation
on
his
fingers
it
tak
a
shullin
an
twapenny
there
was
a
gasping
breath
of
bitter
disappointment
and
one
wee
laddie
wailed
for
lost
bobby
at
that
ailie
dashed
the
tears
from
her
own
eyes
and
sprang
up
spurred
to
desperate
effort
she
would
storm
the
all
but
hopeless
attic
chambers
up
the
twisting
turnpike
stairs
on
the
outer
wall
she
ran
to
where
the
swallows
wheeled
about
the
cornices
and
she
could
hear
the
iron
cross
of
the
knights
templars
creak
above
the
gable
then
all
the
way
along
a
dark
passage
at
one
door
after
another
she
knocked
and
cried
do
ye
ken
greyfriars
bobby
at
some
of
the
doors
there
was
no
answer
at
others
students
stared
out
at
the
bairn
not
in
the
least
comprehending
this
wild
crying
tears
of
anger
and
despair
flooded
the
little
maid
blue
eyes
when
she
beat
on
the
last
door
of
the
row
with
her
doubled
fist
do
ye

greyfriars
bobby
the
police
are
gangin
to

as
the
door
was
flung
open
she
broke
into
stormy
weeping
hey
lassie
i
know
the
dog
what
fashes
you
there
stood
a
tall
student
a
wet
towel
about
his
head
and
behind
him
the
rafters
of
the
closet
were
as
thickly
hung
with
bunches
of
dried
herbs
from
the
botanical
garden
as
any
auld
witch
wife
kitchen
oh

i
wish
i
had
as
many
shullings
as
i
had
gude
times
with
bobby
and
naething
to
pay
for
his
braw
for
this
was
geordie
ross
going
through
the
medical
college
with
the
help
of
heriot
fund
that
large
as
it
was
was
never
quite
enough
for
all
the
poor
and
ambitious
youths
of
edinburgh
and
so
although
provided
for
in
all
necessary
ways
his
pockets
were
nearly
as
empty
as
of
old
he
could
spare
a
sixpence
if
he
made
his
dinner
on
a
potato
and
a
smoked
herring
that
he
was
very
willing
to
do
once
he
had
heard
the
tale
and
he
went
with
ailie
to
the
lodgings
of
other
students
and
demanded
their
siller
with
no
explanation
at
all
give
the
lassie
what
you
can
spare
man
or
i
have
to
give
you
a
licking
was
his
gay
and
convincing
argument
from
door
to
door
until
the
needed
amount
was
made
up
ailie
fled
recklessly
down
the
stairs
and
cried
triumphantly
to
the
silent
crowd
that
had
grown
and
grown
around
tammy
like
some
host
of
children
crusaders
while
ailie
and
tammy
were
collecting
the
price
of
his
ransom
bobby
was
exploring
the
intricately
interior
of
old
giles
sniffing
at
the
rifts
in
flimsily
plastered
partitions
that
the
lord
provost
pointed
out
to
traill
rats
were
in
those
crumbling
walls
if
there
had
been
a
hole
big
enough
to
admit
him
the
plucky
little
dog
would
have
gone
in
after
them
forbidden
to
enlarge
one
bobby
could
only
poke
his
indignant
muzzle
into
apertures
and
brace
himself
as
for
a
fray
and
at
the
very
smell
of
him
there
were
such
squeakings
and
scamperings
in
hidden
runways
as
to
be
almost
beyond
a
terrier
endurance
the
lord
provost
watched
him
with
an
approving
eye
when
these
partitions
are
down
bobby
would
be
vera
useful
in
ridding
our
noble
old
cathedral
of
vermin
but
that
will
not
be
in
this
wee
highlander
day
nor
i
fear
in
about
the
speech
of
this
peebles
man
who
had
risen
from
poverty
to
distinction
learning
wealth
and
many
varieties
of
usefulness
there
was
still
an
engaging
burr
and
his
manner
was
so
simple
that
he
put
the
humblest
at
his
ease
there
had
been
no
formality
about
the
meeting
at
all
glenormiston
was
standing
in
a
rear
doorway
of
the
cathedral
near
the
regent
tomb
looking
out
into
the
sunny
square
of
parliament
close
when
traill
and
bobby
appeared
near
seventy
at
that
time
a
backward
sweep
of
white
hair
and
a
downward
flow
of
white
beard
framed
a
boldly
featured
face
and
left
a
generous
mouth
uncovered
gude
morning
traill
so
that
is
the
famous
dog
that
has
stood
sentinel
for
more
than
eight
years
he
should
be
up
to
the
castle
and
shown
to
young
soldiers
who
grumble
at
hours
guard
duty
how
do
you
do
sir
the
great
man
whom
the
queen
knighted
later
and
whom
the
university
he
was
too
poor
to
attend
as
a
lad
honored
with
a
degree
stooped
from
the
regent
tomb
and
shook
bobby
lifted
paw
with
grave
courtesy
then
leaving
the
little
dog
to
entertain
himself
he
turned
easily
to
his
own
most
absorbing
interest
of
the
moment
do
you
happen
to
care
for
edinburgh
antiquities
traill
reformation
piety
made
sad
havoc
of
art
everywhere
man
come
here
down
into
the
lime
dust
the
lord
provost
and
the
landlord
went
in
their
good
black
clothes
for
a
glimpse
of
a
bit
of
sculpturing
on
a
tomb
that
had
been
walled
in
to
make
a
passage
a
loose
brick
removed
behind
and
above
it
the
sun
flashed
through
fragments
of
emerald
and
ruby
glass
of
a
saint
robe
in
a
bricked
up
window
such
buried
and
forgotten
treasure
glenormiston
explained
filled
the
entire
south
transept
in
the
high
kirk
that
then
filled
the
eastern
end
of
the
cathedral
they
went
up
a
cheap
wooden
stairway
to
the
gallery
that
was
built
into
the
old
choir
and
sat
down
traill
eyes
sparkled
glenormiston
was
a
man
after
his
own
heart
and
they
were
getting
along
famously
but
oh
it
began
to
seem
more
and
more
unlikely
that
a
lord
provost
who
was
concerned
about
such
braw
things
as
the
restoration
of
the
old
cathedral
and
letting
the
sun
into
the
ancient
tenements
should
be
much
interested
in
a
small
masterless
dog
man
auld
john
knox
will
turn
over
in
his
bit
grave
in
parliament
close
if
you
put
a
o
whustles
in
traill
laughed
i
admit
i
might
have
stopped
short
of
the
organ
but
for
the
courageous
example
of
doctor
lee
in
greyfriars
it
was
from
him
that
i
had
a
quite
extravagant
account
of
this
wee
leal
highlander
a
few
years
ago
i
have
aye
meant
to
go
to
see
him
but
i
a
busy
man
and
the
matter
passed
out
of
mind
traill
i
your
sadly
needed
witness
i
heard
you
from
the
doorway
of
the
and
i
sent
up
a
note
confirming
your
story
and
asking
as
a
courtesy
that
the
case
be
turned
over
to
me
for
some
exceptional
disposal
would
you
mind
telling
another
man
the
tale
that
so
moved
doctor
lee
i
aye
had
a
fondness
for
the
human
so
there
above
the
pulpit
of
the
high
kirk
of
giles
the
tale
was
told
again
so
strangely
did
this
little
dog
life
come
to
be
linked
with
the
highest
and
lowest
the
proudest
and
humblest
in
the
scottish
capital
now
at
mention
of
auld
jock
bobby
put
his
shagged
paws
up
inquiringly
on
the
edge
of
the
pew
so
that
traill
lifted
him
he
lay
down
flat
between
the
two
men
with
his
nose
on
his
paws
and
his
little
tousled
head
under
the
lord
provost
hand
auld
jock
lived
again
in
that
recital
glenormiston
coming
from
the
country
of
the
ettrick
shepherd
knew
such
lonely
figures
and
the
pathos
of
old
age
and
waning
powers
that
drove
them
in
to
the
poor
quarters
of
towns
there
was
pictured
the
stormy
night
and
the
simple
old
man
who
sought
food
and
shelter
with
the
devoted
little
dog
that
wasna
sick
unto
death
he
was
and
full
of
ignorant
prejudices
and
fears
that
needed
wise
handling
and
there
was
the
landlord
blunder
humbly
confessed
and
the
obscure
and
tragic
result
of
it
in
a
foul
and
swarming
rookery
juist
aff
the
man
it
was
bobby
that
told
me
of
his
master
condition
he
begged
me
to
help
auld
jock
and
what
did
i
do
but
let
my
fule
tongue
wag
about
doctors
i
nae
more
than
turned
my
back
than
the
auld
body
was
awa
to
his
meeserable
death
it
has
aye
eased
my
conscience
a
bit
to
feed
the
that
not
the
only
reason
why
you
have
fed
there
was
a
twinkle
in
the
lord
provost
eye
and
traill
blushed
weel
i
admit
to
you
that
i
fair
fulish
about
bobby
man
courted
that
sma
terrier
for
eight
and
a
half
years
he
as
polite
and
friendly
as
the
deil
but
he
have
naething
to
do
with
me
or
with
onybody
i
wonder
the
intelligent
bit
does
bite
me
for
the
ill
turn
i
did
his
then
there
was
the
story
of
bobby
devotion
to
auld
jock
memory
to
be
told
the
days
when
he
faced
starvation
rather
than
desert
that
grave
the
days
when
he
lay
cramped
under
the
fallen
and
his
repeated
dramatic
escapes
from
the
pentland
farm
his
never
broken
silence
in
the
kirkyard
was
only
to
be
explained
by
the
unforgotten
orders
of
his
dead
master
his
intelligent
effort
to
make
himself
useful
to
the
caretaker
had
won
indulgence
his
ready
obedience
good
temper
high
spirits
and
friendliness
had
made
him
the
special
pet
of
the
tenement
children
and
the
heriot
laddies
at
the
very
last
traill
repeated
the
talk
he
had
had
with
the
officer
from
the
castle
and
confessed
his
own
fear
of
some
forlorn
end
for
bobby
it
was
true
he
was
nobody
dog
and
he
was
fascinated
by
soldiers
and
military
music
and
so
perhaps
i
no
be
reconciled
to
parting
eh
man
that
what
auld
jock
himsel
said
when
he
was
telling
me
that
the
bit
dog
must
be
returned
to
the
wull
be
sair
partin
tears
stood
in
the
unashamed
landlord
eyes
glenormiston
was
pulling
bobby
silkily
fringed
ears
thoughtfully
through
all
this
talk
about
his
dead
master
the
little
dog
had
not
stirred
for
the
second
time
that
day
bobby
veil
was
pushed
back
first
by
the
most
unfortunate
laddie
in
the
decaying
tenements
about
greyfriars
and
now
by
the
lord
provost
of
the
ancient
royal
burgh
and
capital
of
scotland
and
both
made
the
same
discovery
pools
of
love
young
bobby
eyes
had
dwelt
upon
auld
jock
pools
of
sad
memories
they
were
now
looking
out
wistfully
and
patiently
upon
a
masterless
world
are
you
thinking
he
would
be
reconciled
to
be
anywhere
away
from
that
grave
look
man
lord
forgive
me
i
aye
thought
the
wee
doggie
happy
after
a
moment
the
two
men
went
down
the
gallery
stairs
in
silence
bobby
dropped
from
the
bench
and
fell
into
a
subdued
trot
at
their
heels
as
they
left
the
cathedral
by
the
door
that
led
into
high
street
glenormiston
remarked
with
a
mysterious
smile
i
thinking
edinburgh
can
do
better
by
wee
bobby
than
to
banish
him
to
the
castle
but
wait
a
bit
man
a
kirk
is
not
the
place
for
settling
a
small
dog
the
lord
provost
led
the
way
westward
along
the
cathedral
front
on
high
street
giles
had
three
doorways
the
middle
door
then
gave
admittance
to
the
police
office
the
western
opened
into
the
little
kirk
popularly
known
as
haddo
hole
it
was
into
this
bare
whitewashed
chapel
that
glenormiston
turned
to
get
some
restoration
drawings
he
had
left
on
the
pulpit
he
was
explaining
them
to
traill
when
he
was
interrupted
by
a
murmur
and
a
shuffle
as
of
many
voices
and
feet
and
an
odd
in
the
vestibule
of
all
the
doorways
on
the
north
and
south
fronts
of
giles
the
one
to
the
little
kirk
was
nearest
the
end
of
george
iv
bridge
confused
by
the
vast
size
and
imposing
architecture
of
the
old
cathedral
these
slum
children
in
search
of
the
police
office
went
no
farther
but
ventured
timidly
into
the
open
vestibule
of
haddo
hole
any
doubts
they
might
have
had
about
this
being
the
right
place
were
soon
dispelled
bobby
heard
them
and
darted
out
to
investigate
and
suddenly
they
were
all
inside
overwrought
ailie
on
the
floor
clasping
the
little
dog
and
crying
hysterically
bobby
no
deid
bobby
no
deid
oh
maister
traill
ye
wullna
hae
to
gie
up
to
the
police
tammy
got
the
seven
shullin
in
bonnet
and
there
was
small
tammy
crutches
dropped
and
pouring
that
offering
of
love
and
mercy
out
at
the
foot
of
an
altar
in
old
giles
such
an
astonishing
pile
of
copper
coins
it
was
that
it
looked
to
the
landlord
like
the
loot
of
some
shopkeeper
change
drawer
eh
puir
laddie
whaur
did
ye
get
it
a
noo
he
asked
gravely
tammy
was
very
and
proud
the
bairnies
aroond
the
kirkyaird
gie
it
to
pay
the
police
no
to
mak
bobby
be
traill
flashed
a
glance
at
glenormiston
it
was
a
look
at
once
of
triumph
and
of
humility
over
the
herculean
deed
of
these
disinherited
children
but
the
lord
provost
was
gazing
at
that
crowd
of
pale
bairns
products
of
the
old
town
ancient
slums
and
feeling
in
his
own
person
the
civic
shame
of
it
and
he
was
thinking
thinking
that
he
must
hasten
that
other
project
nearest
his
heart
of
knocking
holes
in
solid
rows
of
foul
cliffs
in
the
cowgate
on
high
street
and
around
greyfriars
it
was
an
incredible
thing
that
such
a
flower
of
affection
should
have
bloomed
so
sweetly
in
such
sunless
cells
and
it
was
a
new
gospel
at
that
time
that
a
dog
or
a
horse
or
a
bird
might
have
its
mission
in
this
world
of
making
people
kinder
and
happier
they
were
all
down
on
the
floor
in
the
space
before
the
altar
unwashed
uncombed
unconscious
of
the
dirty
rags
that
scarce
covered
them
quite
happy
and
in
the
charming
friskings
and
friendly
lollings
of
the
carefully
groomed
beautiful
little
dog
ailie
still
so
excited
that
she
forgot
to
be
shy
put
bobby
through
his
pretty
tricks
he
rolled
over
and
over
he
jumped
he
danced
to
tammy
whistling
of
bonnie
dundee
he
walked
on
his
hind
legs
and
louped
at
a
bonnet
he
begged
he
lifted
his
short
shagged
paw
and
shook
hands
then
he
sniffed
at
the
heap
of
coins
looked
up
inquiringly
at
traill
and
concluding
that
here
was
some
property

be
guarded

by
the
siller
as
stanchly
as
a
soldier
it
was
just
pure
pleasure
to
watch
him
very
suddenly
the
lord
provost
changed
his
mind
a
sacred
kirk
was
the
very
best
place
of
all
to
settle
this
little
dog
affairs
the
offering
of
these
children
could
not
be
refused
it
should
lie
there
below
the
altar
and
be
consecrated
to
some
other
blessed
work
and
he
would
do
now
and
here
what
he
had
meant
to
do
elsewhere
and
in
a
quite
different
way
he
lifted
bobby
to
the
pulpit
so
that
all
might
see
him
and
he
spoke
so
that
all
might
understand
are
ye
kennin
what
it
is
to
gie
the
freedom
o
the
toon

word
from
the
bairns
bobby
havers
a
bittie
dog
wadna
ken
what
to
do
wi
but
glenormiston
was
smiling
and
these
sharp
witted
slum
bairns
exchanged
knowing
glances
whaur
that
sma
he
dived
into
this
pocket
and
that
making
a
great
pretense
of
searching
until
he
found
a
narrow
band
of
new
leather
with
holes
in
one
end
and
a
stout
buckle
on
the
other
and
riveted
fast
in
the
middle
of
it
was
a
shining
brass
plate
tammy
read
the
inscription
aloud
greyfriars
bobby
from
the
lord
provost
licensed
the
wonderful
collar
was
passed
from
hand
to
hand
in
awed
silence
the
children
stared
and
stared
at
this
and
bearded
man
who
wasna
grand
ava
but
who
talked
to
them
as
simply
and
kindly
as
a
grandfaither
he
went
right
on
talking
to
them
in
his
homely
way
to
put
them
at
their
ease
telling
them
that
nobody
at
all
not
even
the
bonny
queen
could
be
more
than
kind
and
and
faithful
to
duty
wee
bobby
was
all
that
and
so
gin
dizzens
an
dizzens
o
bairns

an
he
maun
hae
the
collar
so
the
police
wull
ken
an
no
ever
tak
up
for
a
puir
the
children
quite
understood
the
responsibility
they
assumed
and
their
eyes
shone
with
pride
at
the
feeling
that
if
more
fortunate
friends
failed
this
little
creature
must
never
be
allowed
to
go
hungry
and
when
he
came
to
die
oh
in
a
very
very
few
years
for
they
must
remember
that
a
doggie
isna
as
as
folk
they
must
not
forget
that
bobby
would
not
be
permitted
to
be
buried
in
the
kirkyard
we
gie
a
grand
buryin
said
tammy
we
find
a
green
brae
by
a
babblin
burn
aneath
a
snawy
hawthorn
whaur
the
throstle
sings
the
blackbird
for
the
crippled
laddie
had
never
forgotten
traill
description
of
a
proper
picnic
and
that
must
indeed
be
a
wee
dog
heaven
ay
that
wull
do
fair
the
collar
had
come
back
to
him
by
this
time
and
the
lord
provost
buckled
it
securely
about
bobby
neck
x
the
music
of
bagpipe
fife
and
drum
brought
them
all
out
of
haddo
hole
into
high
street
it
was
the
hour
of
the
morning
drill
and
the
soldiers
were
marching
out
of
the
castle
from
the
front
of
giles
that
jutted
into
the
steep
thoroughfare
they
could
look
up
to
where
the
street
widened
to
the
esplanade
on
castle
hill
rank
after
rank
of
scarlet
coats
swinging
kilts
and
sporrans
and
plumed
bonnets
appeared
the
sun
flashed
back
from
rifle
barrels
and
bayonets
and
from
countless
bright
buttons
a
number
of
the
older
laddies
ran
up
the
climbing
street
traill
called
bobby
back
and
with
a
last
grip
of
glenormiston
hand
set
off
across
the
bridge
to
the
landlord
the
world
seemed
a
brave
place
to
be
living
in
the
fabric
of
earth
and
sky
and
human
society
to
be
woven
of
kindness
having
urgent
business
of
buying
supplies
in
the
markets
at
broughton
and
lauriston
traill
put
bobby
inside
the
kirkyard
gate
and
hurried
away
to
get
into
his
everyday
clothing
after
dinner
or
tea
he
promised
himself
the
pleasure
of
an
hour
at
the
lodge
to
tell
brown
the
wonderful
news
and
to
show
him
bobby
braw
collar
when
finally
he
was
left
alone
bobby
trotted
around
the
kirk
to
assure
himself
that
auld
jock
grave
was
unmolested
there
he
turned
on
his
back
squirmed
and
rocked
on
the
crocuses
and
tugged
at
the
unaccustomed
collar
his
inverted
struggles
low
growlings
and
furry
contortions
set
the
wrens
to
scolding
and
the
redbreasts
to
making
nervous
inquiries
much
nestbuilding
tuneful
courtship
and
masculine
blustering
was
going
on
and
there
was
little
police
duty
for
bobby
after
a
time
he
sat
up
on
the
pensively
with
brown
confined
to
the
lodge
and
mistress
jeanie
in
close
attendance
upon
him
there
the
kirkyard
was
a
lonely
place
for
a
sociable
little
dog
and
a
soft
spring
day
given
over
to
brooding
beside
a
beloved
grave
was
quite
too
a
thing
to
contemplate
just
for
cheerful
occupation
bobby
had
another
tussle
with
the
collar
he
pulled
it
so
far
under
his
thatch
that
no
one
could
have
guessed
that
he
had
a
collar
on
at
all
when
he
suddenly
righted
himself
and
scampered
away
to
the
gate
the
music
grew
louder
and
came
nearer
the
first
of
the
that
the
castle
garrison
practiced
on
occasional
bright
spring
mornings
was
always
a
delightful
surprise
to
the
small
boys
and
dogs
of
edinburgh
usually
the
soldiers
went
down
high
street
and
out
to
portobello
on
the
sea
but
a
regiment
of
tough
and
wiry
highlanders
often
took
by
preference
the
mounting
road
to
the
pentlands
to
get
a
whiff
of
heather
in
their
nostrils
on
they
came
band
playing
colors
flying
feet
moving
in
unison
with
a
march
across
the
viaduct
bridge
into
greyfriars
place
bobby
was
up
on
the
wicket
his
small
energetic
body
quivering
with
excitement
from
his
muzzle
to
his
tail
if
traill
had
been
there
he
would
surely
have
caught
the
infection
thrown
care
to
this
sweet
april
breeze
for
once
and
taken
the
wee
terrier
for
a
run
on
the
pentland
braes
the
temptation
was
going
by
when
a
preoccupied
lady
with
a
sheaf
of
easter
lilies
on
her
sable
arm
opened
the
wicket
her
ample
victorian
skirts
swept
right
over
the
little
dog
and
when
he
emerged
there
was
the
gate
slightly
ajar
widening
the
aperture
with
nose
and
paws
bobby
was
off
skirmishing
at
large
on
the
rear
and
flanks
of
the
troops
down
the
burghmuir
it
may
never
have
happened
in
the
years
since
auld
jock
died
and
the
farmer
of
cauldbrae
gave
up
trying
to
keep
him
on
the
hills
that
bobby
had
gone
so
far
back
on
this
once
familiar
road
and
he
may
not
have
recognized
it
at
first
for
the
highways
around
edinburgh
were
everywhere
much
alike
this
one
alone
began
to
climb
again
up
up
it
toiled
for
two
weary
miles
to
the
hilltop
of
fairmilehead
and
there
the
sounds
and
smells
that
made
it
different
from
other
roads
began
five
miles
out
of
the
city
the
halt
was
called
and
the
soldiers
flung
themselves
on
the
slope
many
experiences
of
had
taught
bobby
that
there
was
an
interval
of
rest
before
the
return
so
with
his
nose
to
the
ground
he
started
up
the
brae
on
a
pilgrimage
to
old
shrines
just
as
in
his
puppyhood
days
at
auld
jock
heels
there
was
much
shouting
of
men
barking
of
collies
and
bleating
of
sheep
all
the
way
up
once
he
had
to
leave
the
road
until
a
driven
flock
had
passed
behind
the
sheep
walked
an
old
laborer
in
woolen
bonnet
and
shepherd
plaid
with
a
lamb
in
the
pouch
of
it
bobby
trembled
at
the
apparition
sniffed
at
the
boots
and
then
with
drooped
head
and
tail
trotted
on
up
the
slope
men
and
dogs
were
all
out
on
the
billowy
pastures
and
the
of
cauldbrae
lay
on
the
level
terrace
seemingly
deserted
and
steeped
in
memories
a
few
moments
before
a
tall
lassie
had
come
out
to
listen
to
the
military
music
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
below
the
coats
of
the
soldiers
looked
to
her
like
poppies
scattered
on
the
heather
at
the
top
of
the
brae
the
wind
was
blowing
a
cold
gale
so
the
maidie
went
up
again
and
around
to
a
bit
of
tangled
garden
on
the
sheltered
side
of
the
house
the
wee
lassie
elsie
was
still
a
bairn
in
short
skirts
and
braids
who
lavished
her
soft
heart
as
yet
on
briar
bushes
and
daisies
bobby
made
a
tour
of
the
sheepfold
the
cowyard
and
byre
and
he
lingered
behind
the
byre
where
auld
jock
had
played
with
him
on
sabbath
afternoons
he
inspected
the
dairy
and
the
where
hens
were
sitting
on
their
nests
by
and
by
he
trotted
around
the
house
and
came
upon
the
lassie
busily
clearing
winter
rubbish
from
her
posie
bed
a
dog
changes
very
little
in
appearance
but
in
eight
and
a
half
years
a
child
grows
into
a
different
person
altogether
bobby
barked
politely
to
let
this
strange
lassie
know
that
he
was
there
in
the
next
instant
he
knew
her
for
she
whirled
about
and
in
a
kind
of
glad
wonder
cried
out
oh
bobby
hae
ye
come
hame
mither
here
ma
ain
wee
bobby
for
she
had
never
given
up
the
hope
that
this
adored
little
pet
would
some
day
return
to
her
havers
lassie

bobby
i
ilka
hielan

and
then
hurried
down

i
wonder
gin

still
leevin
i
the
grand
auld
wary
of
her
remembered
endearments
bobby
kept
a
safe
distance
from
the
maidie
but
he
sat
up
and
lolled
his
tongue
quite
willing
to
pay
her
a
friendly
visit
from
that
she
came
to
a
wrong
conclusion
sin
he
o
his
ain
accord
he
like
to
her
eyes
were
blue
stars
i

stane
leuk
at
that
noo
the
bonny
wee
is
greetin
for
auld
it
was
true
for
on
entering
the
kitchen
bobby
went
straight
to
the
bench
in
the
corner
and
lay
down
flat
under
it
elsie
sat
beside
him
just
as
she
had
done
of
old
her
eyes
overflowed
so
in
sympathy
that
the
mother
was
quite
distracted
this
would
not
do
at
all
lassie
are
ye
no
rememberin
bobby
was
fair
fond
o
eggs
fried
wi
bits
o
cheese
he
wullna

things
an
it

gang
oot
wi
an
rin
on
the
brae
an
bid
find
the
nests
aneath
the
in
a
moment
they
were
out
on
the
heather
and
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
bobby
might
be
won
he
frisked
and
barked
at
elsie
heels
chased
rabbits
and
flushed
the
grouse
and
when
he
ran
into
a
tarp
rimmed
with
moss
he
had
such
a
cold
and
splashy
swim
as
quite
to
give
a
little
dog
a
distaste
for
warm
soapy
water
in
a
claes
tub
he
shook
and
ran
himself
dry
and
he
raced
the
laughing
child
until
they
both
dropped
panting
on
the
heath
then
he
hunted
on
the
ground
under
the
gorse
for
those
nests
that
had
a
dozen
or
more
eggs
in
them
he
took
just
one
from
each
in
his
mouth
as
auld
jock
had
taught
him
to
do
on
the
kitchen
hearth
he
ate
the
savory
meal
with
much
satisfaction
and
polite
waggings
but
when
the
bugle
sounded
from
below
to
form
ranks
he
pricked
his
drop
ears
and
started
for
the
door
before
he
knew
what
had
happened
he
was
inside
the
in
another
instant
he
was
digging
frantically
in
the
soft
earth
under
the
door
when
the
lassie
lay
down
across
the
crack
he
stopped
digging
in
consternation
his
sense
of
smell
told
him
what
it
was
that
shut
out
the
strip
of
light
and
a
bairn
soft
body
is
not
a
proper
object
of
attack
for
a
little
dog
no
matter
how
desperate
the
emergency
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
for
the
drums
began
to
beat
the
march
having
to
get
out
very
quickly
bobby
did
a
forbidden
thing
swiftly
and
noisily
he
dashed
around
the
dark
place
and
there
arose
such
wild
squawkings
and
rushings
of
wings
as
to
bring
the
out
of
the
house
in
alarm
lassie
i
canna
hae
the
bittie
dog
in
wi
the
broodin
chuckies
she
flung
the
door
wide
bobby
shot
through
and
into
outstretched
arms
she
held
to
him
desperately
while
he
twisted
and
struggled
and
strained
away
and
presently
something
shining
worked
into
view
through
the
disordered
thatch
about
his
neck
the
mother
had
come
to
the
help
of
the
child
and
it
was
she
who
read
the
inscription
on
the
brazen
plate
aloud

on

outward

among
the
many
dogs
and
laddies
that
had
followed
the
soldiers
bobby
escaped
notice
but
most
of
these
had
gone
adventuring
in
swanston
dell
to
return
to
the
city
by
the
gorge
of
leith
water
now
traveling
three
miles
to
the
soldiers
one
scampering
in
wide
circles
over
the
fields
swimming
burns
scrambling
under
hedges
chasing
whaups
into
piping
cries
barking
and
louping
in
pure
exuberance
of
spirits
many
eyes
looked
upon
him
admiringly
and
discontented
mouths
turned
upward
at
the
corners
it
is
not
the
least
of
a
little
dog
missions
in
life
to
communicate
his
own
irresponsible
gaiety
to
men
if
the
return
had
been
over
george
iv
bridge
bobby
would
no
doubt
have
dropped
behind
at
traill
or
at
the
kirkyard
but
on
the
burghmuir
the
troops
swung
eastward
until
they
rounded
arthur
seat
and
met
the
cavalry
drilling
before
the
barracks
at
piershill
such
pretty
maneuvering
of
horse
and
foot
took
place
below
holyrood
palace
as
quite
to
enrapture
a
terrier
when
the
infantry
marched
up
the
canongate
and
high
street
the
mounted
men
following
and
the
bands
playing
at
full
blast
the
ancient
thoroughfare
was
quickly
lined
with
cheering
crowds
and
faces
looked
down
from
ten
tiers
of
windows
on
a
beautiful
spectacle
bobby
did
not
know
when
the
was
passed
and
then
on
castle
hill
he
was
in
an
unknown
region
there
the
street
widened
to
the
great
square
of
the
esplanade
the
cavalry
wheeled
and
dashed
down
high
street
but
the
infantry
marched
on
and
up
over
the
sounding
drawbridge
that
spanned
a
dry
moat
of
the
middle
ages
and
through
a
gateway
of
masonry
the
outer
gate
to
the
castle
was
wider
than
the
opening
into
many
an
edinburgh
wynd
but
bobby
stopped
uncertain
as
to
where
this
narrow
roadway
that
curved
upward
to
the
right
might
lead
it
was
not
a
dark
fissure
in
a
cliff
of
houses
but
was
bounded
on
the
outer
side
by
a
loopholed
wall
and
on
the
inner
by
a
rocky
ledge
of
ascending
levels
wherever
the
shelf
was
of
sufficient
breadth
a
battery
of
cannon
was
mounted
and
such
a
flood
of
light
fell
from
above
and
flashed
on
polished
steel
and
brass
as
to
make
the
little
dog
blink
in
bewilderment
and
he
whirled
like
a
rotary
sweeper
in
the
dusty
road
and
yelped
when
the
in
the
battery
at
the
left
of
the
gate
and
behind
him
crashed
and
shook
the
massive
rock
he
barked
and
barked
and
dashed
toward
the
insulting
clamor
the
dauntless
little
dog
and
his
spirited
protest
were
so
out
of
proportion
to
the
huge
offense
that
the
guard
laughed
and
other
soldiers
ran
out
of
the
guard
houses
that
flanked
the
gate
they
would
have
put
the
noisy
terrier
out
at
once
but
bobby
was
off
up
the
curving
roadway
into
the
castle
the
music
had
ceased
and
the
soldiers
had
disappeared
over
the
rise
through
other
dark
arches
of
masonry
he
ran
on
the
crest
were
two
ways
to
choose
the
roadway
on
around
and
past
the
barracks
and
a
flight
of
steps
cut
steeply
in
the
living
rock
of
the
ledge
and
leading
up
to
the
king
bastion
bobby
took
the
stairs
at
a
few
bounds
on
the
summit
there
was
nothing
at
all
beside
a
tiny
ancient
stone
chapel
with
a
norman
arched
and
sculptured
doorway
and
guarding
it
an
enormous
burst
cannon
but
these
ruins
were
the
crown
jewels
of
the
fortifications
their
origins
lost
in
legends
and
so
they
were
cared
for
with
peculiar
reverence
sergeant
scott
of
the
royal
engineers
himself
in
was
down
on
his
knees
before
oratory
pulling
from
a
crevice
in
the
foundations
a
knot
of
grass
that
was
at
its
insidious
work
of
time
and
change
as
bobby
dashed
up
to
the
citadel
still
barking
the
man
jumped
to
his
feet
then
he
slapped
his
thigh
and
laughed
catching
the
animated
little
bundle
of
protest
the
sergeant
set
him
up
for
inspection
on
the
shattered
breeching
of

bugle

blowing
bobby
knew
by
the
gun
that
it
was
the
but
he
had
been
fed
at
the
farm
and
was
not
hungry
he
might
as
well
see
a
bit
more
of
life
he
sat
upon
the
cannon
not
in
the
least
impressed
by
the
honor
and
lolled
his
tongue
in
edinburgh
castle
there
was
nothing
to
alarm
a
little
dog
a
dozen
or
more
large
buildings
in
three
or
four
groups
and
representing
many
periods
of
architecture
lay
to
the
south
and
west
on
the
lowest
terraces
and
about
them
were
generous
parked
spaces
into
the
largest
of
the
buildings
a
long
barracks
the
soldiers
had
vanished
and
now
at
the
blowing
of
a
second
bugle
half
a
hundred
orderlies
hurried
down
from
a
modern
near
the
summit
with
cans
of
soup
and
meat
and
potatoes
the
sergeant
followed
one
of
these
into
a
room
on
the
front
of
the
barracks
in
their
serge
the
sixteen
men
about
the
long
table
looked
as
different
from
the
gay
soldiers
of
the
march
as
though
so
many
scarlet
and
gold
and
bonneted
butterflies
had
turned
back
into
grubs
private
mclean
he
called
to
his
batman
who
for
a
week
cared
for
his
belongings

before
he
could
answer
the
bombardment
of
questions
about
bobby
the
door
was
opened
again
the
men
dropped
their
knives
and
forks
and
stood
at
attention
the
officer
of
the
day
was
making
the
rounds
of
the
forty
or
fifty
such
rooms
in
the
barracks
to
inquire
of
the
soldiers
if
their
dinner
was
satisfactory
he
recognized
at
once
the
attractive
little
skye
that
had
taken
the
eyes
of
the
men
on
the
march
and
asked
about
him
sergeant
scott
explained
that
bobby
had
no
owner
he
was
living
by
permission
in
greyfriars
kirkyard
guarding
the
grave
of
a
humble
master
and
was
fed
by
the
landlord
of
the
near
the
gate
if
the
little
dog
took
a
fancy
to
garrison
life
and
the
regiment
to
him
he
thought
traill
who
had
the
best
claim
upon
him
might
consent
to
his
transfer
to
the
castle
after
orders
at
sunset
he
would
take
bobby
down
to
the
restaurant
himself
i
wish
you
good
luck
the
officer
whistled
and
bobby
leaped
upon
him
and
off
again
and
indulged
in
many
inconsequent
friskings
before
you
take
him
home
fetch
him
over
to
the
officers
mess
at
dinner
it
is
guest
night
and
he
is
sure
to
interest
the
gentlemen
a
loyal
little
creature
who
has
guarded
his
dead
master
grave
for
more
than
eight
years
deserves
to
have
a
toast
drunk
to
him
by
the
officers
of
the
queen
but
it
an
extraordinary
story
and
it
does
sound
altogether
probable
jolly
little
beggar
he
patted
bobby
cordially
on
the
side
and
went
out
the
news
of
his
advent
and
fragments
of
his
story
spread
so
quickly
through
the
barracks
that
mess
after
mess
swarmed
down
from
the
upper
moors
and
out
into
the
roadway
to
see
bobby
private
mclean
stood
in
the
door
smoking
a
cutty
pipe
and
grinning
with
pride
in
the
merry
little
ruffian
of
a
terrier
who
met
the
friendly
advances
of
the
soldiers
more
than
bobby
guardian
would
have
liked
very
well
to
have
sat
before
the
canteen
in
the
sun
and
gossiped
about
his
small
charge
however
in
the
sergeant
above
the
he
had
the
little
dog
all
to
himself
and
bobby
had
the
liveliest
interest
in
the
boxes
and
pots
brushes
and
sponges
and
in
the
processes
of
polishing
burnishing
and
a
soldier
boots
and
buttons
and
belts
as
he
worked
at
his
valeting
the
man
kept
time
with
his
foot
to
rude
ballads
that
he
sang
in
such
a
hissing
celtic
that
bobby
barked
scandalized
by
a
dialect
that
had
been
music
in
the
ears
of
his
ancestors
at
that
private
mclean
danced
a
highland
fling
for
him
and
wee
bobby
came
near
bursting
with
excitement
when
the
sergeant
came
up
to
make
a
magnificent
toilet
for
tea
and
for
the
evening
in
town
the
soldier
expressed
himself
with
enthusiasm
he
iss
a
deffle
of
a
dog
sir
he
was
thought
to
be
a
deffle
of
a
dog
in
the
mess
where
the
officers
had
tea
at
small
writing
and
card
tables
they
talked
and
laughed
very
fast
and
loud
tried
bobby
out
on
all
the
pretty
tricks
he
knew
and
taught
him
to
speak
and
to
jump
for
a
lump
of
sugar
balanced
on
his
nose
they
did
not
fondle
him
and
this
rough
masculine
style
of
pampering
and
petting
was
very
much
to
his
liking
it
was
a
proud
thing
too
for
a
little
dog
to
walk
out
with
the
sergeant
shining
boots
and
twirled
walkingstick
and
be
introduced
into
one
strange
place
after
another
all
around
the
castle
from
tea
to
tattoo
was
playtime
for
the
garrison
many
smartly
dressed
soldiers
with
passes
earned
by
good
behavior
went
out
to
find
amusement
in
the
city
visitors
some
of
them
tourists
from
america
made
the
rounds
under
the
guidance
of
old
soldiers
the
sergeant
followed
such
a
group
of
through
a
postern
behind
the
armory
and
out
onto
the
cliff
there
he
lounged
under
a
above
margaret
well
and
smoked
a
dandified
cigar
while
bobby
explored
the
promenade
and
scraped
acquaintance
with
the
strangers
on
the
northern
and
southern
sides
the
castle
wall
rose
from
the
very
edge
of
sheer
precipices
except
for
loopholes
there
were
no
openings
but
on
the
west
there
was
a
grassy
terrace
without
the
wall
and
below
that
the
cliff
fell
away
a
little
less
steeply
the
declivity
was
clothed
sparsely
with
hazel
shrubs
thorns
whins
and
thistles
and
now
and
then
a
stunted
fir
or
rowan
tree
or
a
group
of
birks
was
stoutly
rooted
on
a
shelving
ledge
had
any
one
the
visitors
asked
ever
escaped
down
this
wild
crag
yes
queen
margaret
children
the
guide
answered
their
father
dead
in
battle
their
saintly
mother
dead
in
the
sanctuary
of
her
tiny
chapel
the
enemy
battering
at
the
gate
soldiers
had
lowered
the
royal
lady
body
in
a
basket
and
got
the
orphaned
children
down
in
safety
and
away
in
a
fog
over
queen
ferry
to
dunfirmline
in
the
kingdom
of
fife
it
was
true
that
a
false
step
or
a
slip
of
the
foot
would
have
dashed
them
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
below
a
gentleman
of
the
party
scouted
the
legend
only
a
fox
or
an
alpine
chamois
could
make
that
perilous
descent
with
his
head
cocked
alertly
bobby
had
stood
listening
hearing
this
vague
talk
of
going
down
he
may
have
thought
these
people
meant
to
go
for
he
quietly
dropped
over
the
edge
and
went
head
over
heels
ten
feet
down
and
landed
in
a
clump
of
hazel
a
lady
screamed
bobby
righted
himself
and
barked
cheerful
reassurance
the
sergeant
sprang
to
his
feet
and
ordered
him
to
come
back
now
the
sergeant
was
pleasant
company
to
be
sure
but
he
was
not
a
person
who
had
to
be
obeyed
so
bobby
barked
again
wagged
his
crested
tail
and
dropped
lower
the
people
who
shuddered
on
the
brink
could
see
that
the
little
dog
was
going
cautiously
enough
and
presently
he
looked
doubtfully
over
a
sheer
fall
of
twenty
feet
turned
and
scrambled
back
to
the
promenade
he
was
cried
and
exclaimed
over
by
the
hysterical
ladies
and
scolded
for
a
bittie
fule
by
the
sergeant
to
this
bobby
returned
ostentatious
yawns
of
boredom
and
nonchalant
lollings
for
it
seemed
a
small
matter
to
be
so
fashed
about
at
that
a
gentleman
remarked
testily
to
hide
his
own
agitation
that
dogs
really
had
very
little
sense
the
sergeant
ordered
bobby
to
precede
him
through
the
postern
and
the
little
dog
complied
amiably
all
the
afternoon
bugles
had
been
blowing
for
each
signal
there
was
a
different
note
and
at
each
uniformed
men
appeared
and
hurried
to
new
points
now
near
sunset
there
was
the
fanfare
for
officers
orders
for
the
next
day
the
sergeant
put
bobby
into
queen
margaret
chapel
bade
him
remain
there
and
went
down
to
the
palace
yard
the
chapel
on
the
summit
was
a
convenient
place
for
picking
the
little
dog
up
on
his
way
to
the
officers
mess
then
he
meant
to
have
his
own
supper
cozily
at
traill
and
to
negotiate
for
bobby
a
dozen
people
would
have
crowded
this
ancient
oratory
but
small
as
it
was
it
was
fitted
with
a
chancel
rail
and
a
font
for
baptizing
the
babies
born
in
the
castle
through
the
window
above
the
altar
where
the
sainted
queen
was
pictured
in
stained
glass
the
sunlight
streamed
and
laid
another
jeweled
image
on
the
stone
floor
then
the
colors
faded
until
the
holy
place
became
an
austere
cell
the
sun
had
dropped
behind
the
western
highlands
bobby
thought
it
quite
time
to
go
home
by
day
he
often
went
far
afield
seeking
distraction
but
at
sunset
he
yearned
for
the
grave
in
greyfriars
the
steps
up
which
he
had
come
lay
in
plain
view
from
the
doorway
of
the
chapel
bobby
dropped
down
the
stairs
and
turned
into
the
main
roadway
of
the
castle
at
the
first
arch
that
spanned
it
a
guard
paced
on
the
other
side
of
a
closed
gate
it
would
not
be
locked
until
tattoo
at
nine
thirty
but
without
a
pass
no
one
could
go
in
or
out
bobby
sprang
on
the
bars
and
barked
as
much
as
to
say
come
awa
man
i
hae
to
get
the
guard
stopped
presented
arms
to
this
small
peremptory
terrier
and
inquired
facetiously
if
he
had
a
pass
bobby
bristled
and
yelped
indignantly
the
soldier
grinned
with
amusement
sentinel
duty
was
lonesome
business
and
any
diversion
a
relief
in
a
guardhouse
asleep
when
bobby
came
into
the
castle
he
had
not
seen
the
little
dog
before
and
knew
nothing
about
him
he
might
be
the
property
of
one
of
the
regiment
ladies
without
orders
he
dared
not
let
bobby
out
a
furious
and
futile
onslaught
on
the
gate
he
met
with
a
jocose
feint
of
his
bayonet
tiring
of
the
play
presently
the
soldier
turned
his
back
and
paced
to
the
end
of
his
beat
bobby
stopped
barking
in
sheer
astonishment
he
gazed
after
the
stiff
retreating
back
in
frightened
disbelief
that
he
was
not
to
be
let
out
he
attacked
the
stone
under
the
barrier
but
quickly
discovered
its
unyielding
nature
then
he
howled
until
the
sentinel
came
back
but
when
the
man
went
by
without
looking
at
him
he
uttered
a
whimpering
cry
and
fled
upward
the
roadway
was
dark
and
the
dusk
was
gathering
on
the
citadel
when
bobby
dashed
across
the
summit
and
down
into
the
brightly
lighted
square
of
the
palace
yard
the
were
being
lighted
on
the
bridge
and
traill
was
getting
into
his
streetcoat
for
his
call
on
brown
when
tammy
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
of
the
restaurant
the
crippled
laddie
had
a
warm
uplifted
look
for
love
had
touched
the
sordid
things
of
life
and
a
miracle
had
bloomed
for
the
tenement

until
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
he
thought
of
course
that
bobby
had
been
in
for
his
dinner
as
usual
and
had
returned
to
the
kirkyard
it
appeared
now
that
no
one
about
the
diningrooms
had
seen
the
little
dog
everybody
had
thought
that
traill
had
taken
bobby
with
him
he
hurried
down
to
the
gate
to
find
mistress
jeanie
at
the
wicket
and
a
crowd
of
tenement
women
and
children
in
the
alcove
and
massed
down

like
a

to
the

and
the
castle
wore
its
luminous
crown
the
lights
from
the
street
lamps
flickered
on
the
anxious
faces
some
of
the
children
had
begun
to
weep
women
offered
loud
suggestions
there
were
surmises
that
bobby

been
run
over
by

in

that

geordie

mcgregor
coming
up

in

knew
of
other
students
and
clerks
who
still
had
these
cherished
toys
of
boyhood
with
these
heroes
in
the
lead
a
score
or
more
of
laddies
swarmed
into
the
kirkyard
the
tenements
were
lighted
up
as
they
had
not
been
since
nobles
held
routs
and
balls
there
enough
candles
and
oil
were
going
up
in
smoke
to
pay
for
wee
bobby
license
all
over
again
and
enough
love
shone
in
pallid
little
faces
that
peered
into
the
dusk
to
light
the
darkest
corner
in
the
heart
of
the
world
rays
from
the
were
thrown
into
every
nook
and
cranny
very
small
laddies
insinuated
themselves
into
the
narrowest
places
they
climbed
upon
high
vaults
and
let
themselves
down
in
last
year
burdocks
and
tangled
vines
it
was
all
done
in
silence
only
traill
speaking
at
all
he
went
everywhere
with
the
searchers
and
called
whaur
are
ye
bobby
come
awa
oot
laddie
but
no
gleaming
ghost
of
a
tousled
dog
was
conjured
by
the
voice
of
affection
the
tiniest
scratching
or
lowest
moaning
could
have
been
heard
for
the
warm
spring
evening
was
very
still
and
there
were
as
yet
few
leaves
to
rustle
sleepy
birds
complained
at
being
disturbed
on
their
perches
and
rodents
could
be
heard
scampering
along
their
runways
the
entire
kirkyard
was
explored
then
the
interior
of
the
two
kirks
traill
went
up
to
the
lodge
for
the
keys
saying
optimistically
that
a
sexton
might
unwittingly
have
locked
bobby
in
young
men
with
lanterns
went
through
the
courts
of
the
tenements
around
the
grassmarket
and
under
the
arches
of
the
bridge
laddies
dropped
from
the
wall
and
hunted
over
heriot
hospital
grounds
to
lauriston
market
tammy
poignantly
conscious
of
being
of
no
practical
use
sat
on
auld
jock
grave
firm
in
the
conviction
that
bobby
would
return
to
that
spot
his
ainsel
and
ailie
being
only
a
maid
whose
portion
it
was
to
wait
and
weep
lay
across
the
on
the
pediment
of
the
tomb
a
limp
little
figure
of
woe
traill
heart
was
full
of
misgiving
nothing
but
death
or
stone
walls
could
keep
that
little
creature
from
this
beloved
grave
but
in
thinking
of
stone
walls
he
never
once
thought
of
the
castle
away
over
to
the
east
in
broughton
market
when
the
garrison
marched
away
and
at
lauriston
when
they
returned
traill
did
not
know
that
the
soldiers
had
been
out
of
the
city
busy
in
the
lodge
mistress
jeanie
had
not
seen
them
go
by
the
kirkyard
and
no
one
else
except
brown
knew
the
fascination
that
military
uniforms
marching
and
music
had
for
wee
bobby
a
fog
began
to
drift
in
from
the
sea
suddenly
the
grass
was
sheeted
and
the
tombs
blurred
a
curtain
of
gauze
seemed
to
be
hung
before
the
lighted
tenements
the
castle
head
vanished
and
the
sounds
of
the
drum
and
bugle
of
the
tattoo
came
down
muffled
as
if
through
layers
of
wool
the
lights
of
the
were
ruddy
discs
that
cast
no
rays
then
these
were
smeared
out
to
phosphorescent
glows
like
the
spunkies
that
everybody
in
scotland
knew
came
out
to
dance
in
old
kirkyards
it
was
no
canny
in
the
smother
of
the
fog
some
of
the
little
boys
were
lost
and
cried
out
traill
got
them
up
to
the
gate
and
sent
them
home
in
bands
under
the
escort
of
the
students
mistress
jeanie
was
out
by
the
wicket
brown
was
asleep
and
she
couldna
thole
it
to
sit
there
when
a
moaned
from
the
firth
she
broke
into
sobbing
traill
comforted
her
as
best
he
could
by
telling
her
a
dozen
plans
for
the
morning
by
feeling
along
the
wall
he
got
her
to
the
lodge
and
himself
up
to
his
cozy
for
the
first
time
since
queen
mary
the
gate
of
the
historic
garden
of
the
greyfriars
was
left
on
the
latch
and
it
was
so
that
a
little
dog
coming
home
in
the
night
might
not
be
shut
out
xi
it
was
more
than
two
hours
after
he
left
bobby
in
queen
chapel
that
the
sergeant
turned
into
the
officers
and
tried
to
get
an
orderly
to
take
a
message
to
the
captain
who
had
noticed
the
little
dog
in
the
barracks
he
wished
to
report
that
bobby
could
not
be
found
and
to
be
excused
to
continue
the
search
he
had
to
wait
by
the
door
while
the
toast
to
her
majesty
was
proposed
and
the
band
in
the
screened
gallery
broke
into
god
save
the
queen
and
when
the
music
stopped
the
bandmaster
came
in
for
the
usual
compliments
the
evening
was
so
warm
and
still
although
it
was
only
that
a
door
opening
on
the
terrace
was
set
ajar
for
air
in
the
confusion
of
movement
and
talk
no
one
noticed
a
little
black
mop
of
a
muzzle
that
was
poked
through
the
aperture
from
the
outer
darkness
bobby
looked
in
on
the
score
or
more
of
men
doubtfully
ready
for
instant
disappearance
on
the
slightest
alarm
desperate
was
the
emergency
forlorn
the
hope
that
had
brought
him
there
at
every
turn
his
efforts
to
escape
from
the
castle
had
been
baffled
he
had
been
imprisoned
by
drummer
boys
and
young
recruits
in
the
gymnasium
detained
in
the
hospital
captured
in
the
canteen
bobby
went
through
all
his
pretty
tricks
for
the
lads
and
then
begged
to
be
let
go
laughed
at
romped
with
dragged
back
thrown
into
the
expected
to
play
and
perform
for
them
he
rebelled
at
last
he
scarred
the
door
with
his
claws
and
he
howled
so
dismally
that
hearing
an
orderly
corporal
coming
they
turned
him
out
in
a
rough
haste
that
terrified
him
in
the
old
banqueting
hall
on
the
palace
yard
that
was
used
as
a
hospital
and
dispensary
he
went
through
that
travesty
of
joy
again
in
hope
of
the
reward
sharply
rebuked
and
put
out
of
the
hospital
at
last
because
of
his
destructive
clawing
and
mournful
howling
bobby
dashed
across
the
palace
yard
and
into
a
crowd
of
soldiers
who
lounged
in
the
canteen
rising
on
his
hind
legs
to
beg
for
attention
and
indulgence
he
was
taken
unaware
from
behind
by
an
admiring
soldier
who
wanted
to
romp
with
him
quite
desperate
by
that
time
he
snapped
at
the
hand
of
his
captor
and
sprang
away
into
the
first
dark
opening
frightened
by
the
man
cry
of
pain
and
by
the
calls
and
scuffling
search
for
him
without
he
slunk
to
the
farthest
corner
of
a
dungeon
of
the
middle
ages
under
the
royal
lodging
when
the
hunt
for
him
ceased
bobby
slipped
out
of
hiding
and
made
his
way
around
the
ledge
of
rock
and
under
the
guns
of
the
battery
to
the
outer
gate
only
a
cat
a
fox
or
a
low
dog
could
have
done
it
there
were
many
details
that
would
have
enabled
the
observant
little
creature
to
recognize
this
barrier
as
the
place
where
he
had
come
in
certainly
he
attacked
it
with
fury
and
on
the
guards
he
lavished
every
art
of
appeal
that
he
possessed
but
there
he
was
bantered
and
a
feint
was
made
of
shutting
him
up
in
the
as
a
disorderly
person
with
a
cry
he
escaped
his
tormentors
and
made
his
way
back
under
the
guns
to
the
citadel
his
confidence
in
the
good
intentions
of
men
shaken
bobby
took
to
furtive
ways
avoiding
lighted
buildings
and
voices
he
sped
from
shadow
to
shadow
and
explored
the
walls
of
solid
masonry
again
and
again
he
returned
to
the
postern
behind
the
armory
but
the
small
back
gate
that
gave
to
the
cliff
was
not
opened
once
he
scrambled
up
to
a
loophole
in
the
fortifications
and
looked
abroad
at
the
scattered
lights
of
the
city
set
in
the
void
of
night
but
there
indeed
his
stout
heart
failed
him
it
was
not
long
before
bobby
discovered
that
he
was
being
pursued
a
number
of
soldiers
and
drummer
boys
were
out
hunting
for
him
contritely
enough
when
the
situation
was
explained
by
the
angry
sergeant
wherever
he
went
voices
and
footsteps
followed
had
the
sergeant
gone
alone
and
called
in
familiar
speech
come
awa
oot
bobby
he
would
probably
have
run
to
the
man
but
there
were
so
many
calls
in
english
in
celtic
and
in
various
dialects
of
the
lowlands
that
the
little
dog
dared
not
trust
them
from
place
to
place
he
was
driven
by
fear
and
when
the
calling
stopped
and
the
footsteps
no
longer
followed
he
lay
for
a
time
where
he
could
watch
the
postern
a
moment
after
he
gave
up
the
vigil
there
the
little
back
gate
was
opened
desperation
led
him
to
take
another
chance
with
men
slipping
into
the
shadow
of
the
old
governor
house
the
headquarters
of
commissioned
officers
on
the
terrace
above
the
barracks
he
lay
near
the
open
door
to
the
listening
and
watching
the
pretty
ceremony
of
toasting
the
bandmaster
brought
all
the
company
about
the
table
again
and
the
polite
pause
in
the
conversation
on
his
exit
gave
an
opportunity
for
the
captain
to
speak
of
bobby
before
the
sergeant
could
get
his
message
delivered
gentlemen
your
indulgence
for
a
moment
to
drink
another
toast
to
a
little
dog
that
is
said
to
have
slept
on
his
master
grave
in
greyfriars
churchyard
for
more
than
eight
years
sergeant
scott
of
the
royal
engineers
vouches
for
the
story
and
will
present
the
the
sergeant
came
forward
then
with
the
word
that
bobby
could
not
be
found
he
was
somewhere
in
the
castle
and
had
made
persistent
and
frantic
efforts
to
get
out
prevented
at
every
turn
and
forcibly
held
in
various
places
by
but
blundering
soldiers
he
had
been
frightened
into
hiding
bobby
heard
every
word
and
he
must
have
understood
that
he
himself
was
under
discussion
alternately
hopeful
and
apprehensive
he
scanned
each
face
in
the
room
that
came
within
range
of
his
vision
until
one
arrested
and
drew
him
such
faces
full
of
understanding
love
and
compassion
for
dumb
animals
are
to
be
found
among
men
women
and
children
in
any
company
and
in
every
corner
of
the
world
now
with
the
dog
instinct
for
the
bobby
made
his
way
about
the
room
unnoticed
and
set
his
short
shagged
paws
up
on
this
man
knee
bless
my
soul
gentlemen
here
the
little
dog
now
and
a
beautiful
specimen
of
the
skye
he
is
why
did
you
say
that
the
dog
was
of
the
highland
breed
sergeant
you
may
well
believe
any
extravagant
tale
you
may
hear
of
the
fidelity
and
affection
of
the
skye
and
with
that
wee
bobby
was
set
upon
the
polished
table
his
own
silver
image
glimmering
among
the
reflections
of
candles
and
old
plate
he
kept
close
under
the
hand
of
his
protector
but
waiting
for
the
moment
favorable
to
his
appeal
the
company
crowded
around
with
eager
interest
while
the
man
of
expert
knowledge
and
love
of
dogs
talked
about
bobby
you
see
he
a
little
rascal
long
and
low
hardy
and
strong
his
ancestors
were
bred
for
bolting
foxes
and
wildcats
among
the
rocky
headlands
of
the
subarctic
islands
the
intelligence
courage
and
devotion
of
dogs
of
this
breed
can
scarcely
be
overstated
there
is
some
far
away
crossing
here
that
gives
this
one
a
greater
beauty
and
grace
and
more
engaging
manners
making
him
a
among
rough
farm
dogs
but
look
at
the
length
and
strength
of
the
muzzle
he
as
determined
as
the
deil
you
would
have
to
break
his
neck
before
you
could
break
his
purpose
for
love
of
his
master
he
would
starve
or
he
would
leap
to
his
death
without
an
instant
all
this
time
the
man
had
been
stroking
bobby
head
and
neck
now
feeling
the
collar
under
the
thatch
he
slipped
it
out
and
brought
the
brass
plate
up
to
the
light
propose
your
toast
to
greyfriars
bobby
captain
his
story
is
vouched
for
by
no
less
a
person
than
the
lord
provost
the
dog
seems
to
have
won
a
sort
of
canine
victoria
the
toast
was
drunk
standing
and
a
cheer
given
the
company
pressed
close
to
examine
the
collar
and
to
shake
bobby
lifted
paw
then
thinking
the
moment
had
come
bobby
rose
in
the
begging
attitude
prostrated
himself
before
them
and
uttered
a
pleading
cry
his
new
friend
assured
him
that
he
would
be
taken
home
bide
a
wee
bobby
before
he
goes
i
want
you
all
to
see
his
beautiful
eyes
in
most
breeds
of
dogs
with
the
veil
you
will
find
the
hairs
of
the
face
discolored
by
tears
but
the
skye
terrier
are
not
and
his
eyes
are
living
jewels
as
sunny
a
brown
as
cairngorms
in
pebble
brooches
but
soft
and
deep
and
with
an
almost
human
for
the
third
time
that
day
bobby
veil
was
pushed
back
one
shocked
look
by
this
lover
of
dogs
and
it
was
dropped
get
him
back
to
that
grave
man
or
he
like
to
die
his
eyes
are
just
two
cairngorms
of
in
the
hush
that
fell
upon
the
company
the
senior
officer
spoke
sharply
take
him
down
at
once
sergeant
the
whole
affair
is
most
unfortunate
and
you
will
please
tender
my
apologies
at
the
churchyard
and
the
restaurant
as
well
as
your
own
and
i
will
see
the
lord
the
military
salute
was
given
to
bobby
when
he
leaped
from
the
table
at
the
sergeant
call
come
awa
bobby
i
tak
ye
to
auld
jock
i
the
kirkyaird
he
stepped
out
onto
the
lawn
to
wait
for
his
pass
bobby
stood
at
his
feet
quivering
with
impatience
to
be
off
but
trusting
in
the
given
word
the
upper
air
was
clear
and
the
sky
studded
with
stars
twenty
minutes
before
the
may
light
that
guided
the
ships
into
the
firth
could
be
seen
far
out
on
the
edge
of
the
ocean
and
in
every
direction
the
lamps
of
the
city
seemed
to
fall
away
in
a
shower
of
sparks
as
from
a
burst
meteor
but
now
while
the
stars
above
were
as
numerous
and
as
brilliant
as
before
the
lights
below
had
vanished
as
the
sergeant
looked
the
highest
ones
expired
in
the
rising
fog
the
island
rock
appeared
to
be
sinking
in
a
waveless
sea
of
milk
a
startled
exclamation
from
the
sergeant
brought
other
men
out
on
the
terrace
to
see
it
the
senior
officer
withheld
the
pass
in
his
hand
and
scouted
the
idea
of
the
sergeant
going
down
into
the
city
as
the
drum
began
to
beat
the
tattoo
and
the
bugle
to
rise
on
a
crescendo
of
lovely
notes
soldiers
swarmed
toward
the
barracks
those
who
had
been
out
in
the
town
came
running
up
the
roadway
into
the
castle
talking
loudly
of
adventures
they
had
had
in
the
fog
the
sergeant
looked
down
at
anxious
bobby
who
stood
agitated
and
straining
as
at
a
leash
and
said
that
he
preferred
to
go
impossible
a
foolish
risk
sergeant
that
i
am
unwilling
you
should
take
edinburgh
is
too
full
of
pitfalls
for
a
man
to
be
going
about
on
such
a
night
our
guests
will
sleep
in
the
castle
and
it
will
be
safer
for
the
little
dog
to
remain
until
bobby
did
not
quite
understand
this
good
english
but
the
excited
talk
and
the
delay
made
him
uneasy
he
whimpered
piteously
he
lay
across
the
sergeant
feet
and
through
his
boots
the
man
could
feel
the
little
creature
heart
beat
then
he
rose
and
uttered
his
pleading
cry
the
sergeant
stooped
and
patted
the
shaggy
head
consolingly
and
tried
to
explain
matters
be
a
gude
doggie
noo
dinna
fash
yersel
aboot
what
canna
be
helped
i
canna
tak
ye
to
the
kirkyaird
the
i
take
charge
of
bobby
the
guest
ran
out
hastily
but
with
a
wild
cry
of
reproach
and
despair
bobby
was
gone
the
group
of
soldiers
who
had
been
out
on
the
cliff
were
standing
in
the
postern
a
moment
to
look
down
at
the
opaque
flood
that
was
rising
around
the
rock
they
felt
some
flying
thing
sweep
over
their
feet
and
caught
a
silvery
flash
of
it
across
the
promenade
the
sergeant
cried
to
them
to
stop
the
dog
and
he
and
the
guest
were
out
in
time
to
see
bobby
go
over
the
precipice
for
a
time
the
little
dog
lay
in
a
clump
of
hazel
above
the
fog
between
two
terrors
he
could
see
the
men
and
the
lights
moving
along
the
top
of
the
cliff
and
he
could
hear
the
calls
some
one
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
and
the
sergeant
lay
down
on
the
edge
of
the
precipice
and
talked
to
him
saying
every
kind
and
foolish
thing
he
could
think
of
to
persuade
bobby
to
come
back
then
a
drummer
boy
was
tied
to
a
rope
and
let
down
to
the
ledge
to
fetch
him
up
but
at
that
without
any
sound
at
all
bobby
dropped
out
of
sight
through
the
smother
came
the
loud
moaning
of
in
the
firth
although
nothing
could
be
seen
and
sounds
were
muffled
as
if
the
ears
of
the
world
were
stuffed
with
wool
odors
were
held
captive
and
mingled
in
confusion
there
was
nothing
to
guide
a
little
dog
nose
everything
to
make
him
distrust
his
most
reliable
sense
the
smell
of
every
plant
on
the
crag
was
there
the
odors
of
leather
of
paint
of
wood
of
iron
from
the
crafts
shops
at
the
base
smoke
from
chimneys
in
the
valley
was
mixed
with
the
strong
scent
of
horses
hay
and
grain
from
the
street
of
king
stables
there
was
the
smell
of
furry
rodents
of
nesting
birds
of
gushing
springs
of
the
earth
itself
and
something
more
ancient
still
as
of
fires
in
the
huge
mass
of
everything
warned
bobby
to
lie
still
in
safety
until
morning
and
the
world
was
restored
to
its
normal
aspects
but
ah
in
the
highest
type
of
man
and
dog
and
not
is
the
first
law
a
deserted
grave
cried
to
him
across
the
void
the
anguish
of
protecting
love
urged
him
on
to
take
perilous
chances
falling
upon
a
narrow
shelf
of
rock
he
had
bounded
off
and
into
a
thicket
of
thorns
bruised
and
shaken
and
bewildered
he
lay
there
for
a
time
and
tried
to
get
his
bearings
bobby
knew
only
that
the
way
was
downward
he
put
out
a
paw
and
felt
for
the
edge
of
the
shelf
a
thorn
bush
rooted
below
tickled
his
nose
he
dropped
into
that
and
scrambled
out
again
loose
earth
broke
under
his
struggles
and
carried
him
swiftly
down
to
a
new
level
he
slipped
in
the
wet
moss
of
a
spring
before
he
heard
the
tinkle
of
the
water
lost
his
foothold
and
fell
against
a
sharp
point
of
rock
the
shadowy
spire
of
a
looming
in
a
parting
of
the
vapor
for
an
instant
bobby
leaped
to
the
ledge
upon
which
it
was
rooted
foot
by
foot
he
went
down
with
no
guidance
at
all
it
is
the
nature
of
such
long
low
earth
dogs
to
go
by
leaps
and
bounds
like
foxes
calculating
distances
nicely
when
they
can
see
and
tearing
across
the
roughest
country
with
the
speed
of
the
wild
animals
they
hunt
and
where
the
way
is
very
steep
they
can
scramble
up
or
down
any
declivity
that
is
at
a
lesser
angle
than
the
perpendicular
head
first
they
go
downward
setting
the
fore
paws
forward
the
claws
clutching
around
projections
and
in
fissures
the
weight
hung
from
the
stout
hindquarters
the
body
flattened
on
the
earth
thus
bobby
crept
down
steep
descents
in
safety
but
his
claws
were
broken
in
crevices
and
his
feet
were
torn
and
pierced
by
splinters
of
rock
and
thorns
once
he
went
some
distance
into
a
cave
and
had
to
back
up
and
out
again
and
then
a
promising
slope
shelving
under
suddenly
where
he
could
not
retreat
he
leaped
turned
over
and
over
in
the
air
and
fell
stunned
his
heart
filled
with
fear
of
the
unseen
before
him
the
little
dog
lay
for
a
long
time
in
a
clump
of
whins
he
may
even
have
dozed
and
dreamed
to
be
awakened
with
starts
by
his
misery
of
longing
and
once
by
the
barking
of
a
dog
it
came
up
deadened
as
if
from
fathoms
below
he
stood
up
and
listened
but
the
sound
was
not
repeated
his
lacerated
feet
burned
and
throbbed
his
bruised
muscles
had
begun
to
stiffen
so
that
every
movement
was
a
pain
in
these
lower
levels
there
was
more
smoke
that
smeared
out
and
thickened
the
mist
suddenly
a
breath
of
air
parted
the
fog
as
if
it
were
a
torn
curtain
like
a
shot
bobby
went
down
the
crag
leaping
from
rock
to
rock
scrambling
under
thorns
and
hazel
shrubs
dropping
over
precipitous
ledges
until
he
looked
down
a
sheer
fall
on
which
not
even
a
knot
of
grass
could
find
a
foothold
he
took
the
leap
instantly
and
his
thick
fleece
saved
him
from
broken
bones
but
when
he
tried
to
get
up
again
his
body
was
racked
with
pain
and
his
hind
legs
refused
to
serve
him
turning
swiftly
he
snarled
and
bit
at
them
in
angry
disbelief
that
his
good
little
legs
should
play
false
with
his
stout
heart
then
he
quite
forgot
his
pain
for
there
was
the
sharp
ring
of
iron
on
an
anvil
and
the
dull
glow
of
a
forge
fire
where
a
smith
was
toiling
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
a
clever
and
resourceful
little
dog
bobby
made
shift
to
do
without
legs
turning
on
his
side
he
rolled
down
the
last
slope
of
castle
rock
crawling
between
two
buildings
and
dropping
from
the
terrace
on
which
they
stood
he
fell
into
a
little
street
at
the
west
end
and
above
the
grassmarket
here
the
odors
were
all
of
the
stables
he
knew
the
way
and
that
it
was
still
downward
the
distance
he
had
to
go
was
a
matter
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
less
and
the
greater
part
of
it
was
on
the
level
through
the
sunken
valley
of
the
grassmarket
but
bobby
had
literally
to
drag
himself
now
and
he
had
still
to
pull
him
self
up
by
his
fore
paws
over
the
wet
and
greasy
cobblestones
of
candlemakers
row
had
not
the
great
leaves
of
the
gate
to
the
kirkyard
been
left
on
the
latch
he
would
have
had
to
lie
there
in
the
alcove
with
his
nose
under
the
bars
until
morning
but
the
gate
gave
way
to
his
push
and
so
he
dragged
himself
through
it
and
around
the
kirk
and
stretched
himself
on
auld
grave
it
was
the
birds
that
found
him
there
in
the
misty
dawn
they
were
used
to
seeing
bobby
scampering
about
for
the
little
watchman
was
awake
and
busy
as
early
as
the
feathered
dwellers
in
the
kirkyard
but
in
what
looked
to
be
a
wet
and
furry
left
out
overnight
on
the
grass
they
did
not
know
him
at
all
the
throstles
and
skylarks
were
shy
of
it
thinking
it
might
be
alive
the
wrens
fluffed
themselves
scolded
it
and
told
it
to
get
up
the
blue
titmice
flew
over
it
in
a
flock
again
and
again
with
much
sweet
gossiping
but
they
did
not
venture
nearer
a
redbreast
lighted
on
the
rose
bush
that
marked
auld
jock
grave
cocked
its
head
knowingly
and
warbled
a
little
song
as
much
as
to
say
if
it
alive
that
will
wake
it
as
bobby
did
not
stir
the
robin
fluttered
down
studied
him
from
all
sides
made
polite
inquiries
that
were
not
answered
and
concluded
that
it
would
be
quite
safe
to
take
a
silver
hair
for
nest
lining
then
startled
by
the
animal
warmth
or
by
a
faint
breathing
movement
it
dropped
the
shining
trophy
and
flew
away
in
a
shrill
panic
at
that
all
the
birds
set
up
such
an
excited
crying
that
they
waked
tammy
from
the
rude
loophole
of
a
window
that
projected
from
the
old
cunzie
neuk
the
crippled
laddie
could
see
only
the
shadowy
tombs
and
the
long
gray
wall
of
the
two
kirks
through
the
sunny
haze
but
he
dropped
his
crutches
over
and
climbed
out
onto
the
vault
never
before
had
bobby
failed
to
hear
that
on
the
graveled
path
nor
failed
to
trot
down
to
meet
it
with
friskings
of
welcome
but
now
he
lay
very
still
even
when
a
pair
of
frail
arms
tried
to
lift
his
dead
weight
to
a
heaving
breast
and
tammy
cry
of
woe
rang
through
the
kirkyard
in
a
moment
ailie
and
mistress
jeanie
were
in
the
wet
grass
beside
them
half
a
hundred
casements
flew
open
and
the
piping
voices
of
tenement
bairns
did
the
bittie
doggie
come
hame
oh
yes
the
bittie
doggie
had
come
hame
indeed
but
down
such
perilous
heights
as
none
of
them
dreamed
and
now
in
what
a
woeful
plight
some
murmur
of
the
excitement
reached
an
open
dormer
of
the
temple
tenements
where
geordie
ross
had
slept
with
one
ear
of
the
born
doctor
open
snatching
up
a
case
of
first
aids
to
the
injured
he
ran
down
the
twisting
stairs
to
the
grassmarket
up
to
the
gate
and
around
the
kirk
to
find
a
huddled
group
of
women
and
children
weeping
over
a
limp
little
bundle
of
a
senseless
dog
he
thrust
a
bottle
of
hartshorn
under
the
black
muzzle
and
with
a
start
and
a
moan
bobby
came
back
to
consciousness
lay
him
down
flat
and
stop
your
havers
ordered
the
embryo
medicine
man
bobby
no
dead
laddie
you
a
braw
soldier
for
holding
your
ain
feelings
so
just
hold
the
wee
dog
then
in
the
reassuring
dialect
hoots
bobby
open
the
bit
mou
noo
tak
the
medicine
like
a
mannie
down
the
tiny
red
cavern
of
a
throat
geordie
poured
a
dose
that
galvanized
the
small
creature
into
life
noo
then
loup
ye
bonny
rascal
bobby
did
his
best
to
jump
at
geordie
bidding
he
was
so
glad
to
be
at
home
and
to
see
all
these
familiar
faces
of
love
that
he
lifted
himself
on
his
fore
paws
and
his
happy
heart
almost
put
the
power
to
loup
into
his
hind
legs
but
when
he
tried
to
stand
up
he
cried
out
with
the
pains
and
sank
down
again
with
an
apologetic
and
shamefaced
look
that
was
worthy
of
auld
jock
himself
geordie
sobered
on
the
instant
weel
now
he
been
hurt
we
just
have
to
see
what
ails
the
sonsie
he
ran
his
hand
down
the
parting
in
the
thatch
to
discover
if
the
spine
had
been
injured
when
he
suddenly
pinched
the
ball
of
a
hind
toe
bobby
promptly
resented
it
by
jerking
his
head
around
and
looking
at
him
reproachfully
the
bairns
were
indignant
too
but
geordie
grinned
cheerfully
and
said
he
no
paralyzed
at
ony
he
turned
as
footsteps
were
heard
coming
hastily
around
the
kirk
a
gude
morning
to
you
traill
bobby
may
have
been
run
over
by
a
cart
and
got
internal
injuries
but
i
thinking
it
just
sprains
and
bruises
from
a
bad
fall
he
was
in
a
state
of
collapse
and
his
claws
are
as
broken
and
his
toes
as
torn
as
if
he
had
come
down
castle
this
was
such
an
extravagant
surmise
that
even
the
anxious
landlord
smiled
then
he
said
drily
you
a
braw
laddie
geordie
and
gudehearted
but
you
no
a
doctor
yet
and
with
your
leave
i

my
ain
medical
man

a
look
at

i
would
geordie
agreed
cordially

worth
four
shullings
to
have
your
mind
at
ease
man
i
just
go
up
to
the
lodge
and
get
a
warm
bath
ready
to
tak
the
stiffness
out
of
his
muscles
and
brew
a
tea
from
an
herb
that
wee
wild
creatures
know
all
about
and
aye
hunt
for
when
they
geordie
went
away
gaily
to
take
disorder
and
evil
smells
into
mistress
jeanie
shining
kitchen
no
sooner
had
the
medical
student
gone
up
to
the
lodge
and
the
children
had
been
persuaded
to
go
home
to
watch
the
proceedings
anxiously
from
the
amphitheater
of
the
tenement
windows
than
the
kirkyard
gate
was
slammed
back
noisily
by
a
man
in
a
hurry
it
was
the
sergeant
who
in
the
splendor
of
full
uniform
dropped
in
the
wet
grass
beside
bobby

misadventure
traill
fixed
an
accusing
eye
on
the
soldier
remembering
suddenly
his
laughing
threat
to
kidnap
bobby
the
story
came
out
in
a
flood
of
remorseful
words
from
bobby
following
of
the
troops
so
gaily
into
the
castle
to
his
desperate
escape
over
the
precipice
noo
he
said
humbly

of
he
turned
an
angry
back
on
the
sergeant
and
helped
geordie
lift
bobby
onto
brown
braided
and
carry
the
improvised
litter
up
to
the
lodge
in
the
kitchen
the
little
dog
was
lowered
into
a
hot
bath
dried
and
rubbed
with
liniments
under
his
fleece
after
his
lacerated
feet
had
been
cleaned
and
dressed
with
healing
ointments
and
tied
up
bobby
was
wrapped
in
mistress
jeanie
best
flannel
petticoat
and
laid
on
the
a
very
comfortable
wee
dog
who
enjoyed
his
breakfast
of
broth
and
porridge
brown
hearing
the
commotion
and
perishing
of
curiosity
demanded
that
some
one
should
come
and
help
him
out
of
bed
as
no
attention
was
paid
to
him
he
managed
to
get
up
himself
and
to
hobble
out
to
the
kitchen
just
as
traill
ain
medical
man
came
in
bobby
spine
was
examined
again
the
tail
and
toes
nipped
the
heart
tested
and
all
the
soft
parts
of
his
body
pressed
and
punched
in
spite
of
the
little
vigorous
objections
to
these
indignities
except
for
sprains
and
bruises
the
wee
dog
is
all
right
came
down
castle
crag
in
the
fog
did
he
he
a
clever
and
plucky
little

very
well
ross
just
take
as
good
care
of
him
for
a
week
or
so
and
he
could
do
the
gallant
deed
brown
listened
to
the
story
of
bobby
adventures
with
a
mingled
look
of
disgust
at
the
foolishness
of
men
pride
in
bobby
prowess
and
resentment
at
having
been
left
out
of
the
drama
of
the
night
before
it
maist
michty
noo
maister
traill
that
ye
wad
tak
the
leeberty
o
leein
to
me
he
complained
it
was
a
gude
lee
or
a
bad
nicht
for
an
ill
man
geordie
will
tell
you
that
a
mind
at
ease
is
worth
four
shullings
and
i
charging
you
naething
eh
man
you
deeficult
to
as
he
went
out
into
the
kirkyard
traill
stopped
to
reflect
on
a
strange
thing
done
very
well
mr
ross
weel
weel
how
the
laddies
do
grow
up
but
no
going
to
admit
it
to
another
thought
over
which
he
chuckled
sent
him
off
to
find
the
sergeant
the
soldier
was
tramping
gloomily
about
in
the
wet
to
the
demoralization
of
his
beautiful
boots
man
since
a
stormy
nicht
eight
years
ago
last
november
i
aye
been
looking
for
a
bigger
weel
meaning
fule
than
my
ain
sel
you
the
man
so
if
you
just
shak
hands
we
say
nae
more
about
he
did
not
explain
this
cryptic
remark
but
he
went
on
to
assure
the
sorry
soldier
that
bobby
had
got
no
serious
hurt
and
would
soon
be
as
well
as
ever
they
had
turned
toward
the
gate
when
a
stranger
with
a
newspaper
in
his
hand
peered
mildly
around
the
kirk
and
inquired
do
ye
ken
whaur
the
sma
dog
man
as
traill
continued
to
stare
at
him
he
explained
patiently
it
greyfriars
bobby
the
bittie
terrier
the
laird
provost
gied
the
collar
to
hae
ye
no
seen
scotsman
the
day
the
landlord
had
not
and
there
was
the
story
bobby
name
heading
quite
a
quarter
of
a
broad
column
of
fine
print
and
beginning
with
a
very
singular
and
interesting
occurrence
was
brought
to
light
in
the
burgh
court
by
the
hearing
of
a
summons
in
regard
to
a
dog
bobby
was
a
famous
dog
and
traill
came
in
for
a
goodly
portion
of
reflected
glory
he
threw
up
his
hands
in
dismay
it
all
over
the
toon
turning
to
the
stranger
he
assured
him
that
bobby
was
not
to
be
seen
he
hurt
himsel
coming
down
castle
rock
in
the
nicht
and
is
in
the
lodge
with
the
caretaker
wha
fair
hoo
do
i
ken
testily
weel
man
i
he
saw
at
once
how
unwise
was
that
admission
for
he
had
to
shake
hands
with
the
cordial
stranger
and
after
dismissing
him
there
was
another
at
the
gate
who
insisted
upon
going
up
to
the
lodge
to
see
the
little
hero
here
was
a
state
of
things
indeed
that
called
upon
all
the
powers
of
the
resourceful
landlord
all
the
folk
in
edinburgh
will
be
coming
and
the
poor
woman
be
deaved
with
their
and
then
he
began
to
laugh
did
you
ever
hear
sic
a
thing
as
poetic
justice
sergeant
nae
it
no
the
kind
get
in
the
courts

it
poetic
justice
for
a

airth
and
the
fullness
thereof
to
have

his
orders
from
a
sma
shopkeeper

up
to
the
police
office
in
gila
now
and
ask
for
an
officer
to
stand
at
the
gate
here
to
answer
questions
and
to
keep
the
folk
awa
from
the
he
stood
guard
himself
and
satisfied
a
score
of
visitors
before
the
sergeant
came
back
and
there
was
another
instance
of
poetic
justice
in
the
crestfallen
burgh
policeman
who
had
been
sent
with
instructions
to
take
his
orders
from
the
delighted
landlord
eh
davie

at

penance
that
was
laid
upon

foe

landlord
felt
so
well
satisfied
with
the
world
that
he
took
another
jaunty
crack
at
the
sergeant
by
richts
man
you
ought
to
go
to
gaol
but
i
just
fine
you
a
shulling
a
month
for
bobby
natural
lifetime
to
give
the
wee
soldier
a
treat
of
a
steak
or
a
chop
once
a
hands
were
struck
heartily
on
the
bargain
and
the
two
men
parted
good
friends
now
finding
ailie
dropping
tears
in
the
traill
sent
her
flying
down
to
the
lodge
with
instructions
to
make
herself
useful
to
brown
then
he
was
himself
besieged
in
his
place
of
business
by
folk
of
high
and
low
degree
who
were
disappointed
by
their
failure
to
see
bobby
in
the
kirkyard
greyfriars
had
more
distinguished
visitors
in
a
day
than
they
had
had
in
all
the
years
since
auld
jock
died
and
a
little
dog
fell
there
at
the
landlord
feet
but
deid
wi
not
one
of
all
the
grand
folk
who
inquired
for
bobby
at
the
kirkyard
or
at
the
restaurant
got
a
glimpse
of
him
that
day
but
after
they
were
gone
the
tenement
dwellers
came
up
to
the
gate
again
as
they
had
gathered
the
evening
before
and
begged
that
they
might
just
tak
a
look
at
him
and
his
braw
collar
the
bonny
bit
is
the
bairns
ain
doggie
an
the
laird
provost
himsel
told
he
wasna
to
be
neglectet
was
one
mother
plea
ah
that
was
very
true
to
the
grand
folk
who
had
come
to
see
him
bobby
was
only
a
wonder
his
story
had
touched
the
hearts
of
all
orders
of
society
for
a
time
strangers
would
come
to
see
him
and
then
they
would
forget
all
about
him
or
remember
him
only
fitfully
it
was
to
these
poor
people
around
the
kirkyard
themselves
forgotten
by
the
more
fortunate
that
the
little
dog
must
look
for
his
daily
meed
of
affection
and
companionship
traill
spoke
to
them
kindly
bide
a
wee
noo
an
i
fetch
the
doggie
bobby
had
slept
blissfully
nearly
all
the
day
after
his
exhausting
labors
and
torturing
pains
but
with
the
sunset
bugle
he
fretted
to
be
let
out
ailie
had
wept
and
pleaded
brown
had
reasoned
with
him
and
brown
had
scolded
all
to
the
end
of
persuading
him
to
sleep
in
the
hoose
the
but
when
no
one
was
watching
him
bobby
crawled
from
his
rug
and
dragged
himself
to
the
door
he
rapped
the
floor
with
his
tail
in
delight
when
traill
came
in
and
bundled
him
up
on
the
rug
so
he
could
lie
easily
and
carried
him
down
to
the
gate
for
quite
twenty
minutes
these
neighbors
and
friends
of
bobby
filed
by
silently
patted
the
shaggy
little
head
looked
at
the
grand
plate
with
bobby
and
the
lord
provost
names
upon
it
and
believed
their
own
wondering
een
bobby
wagged
his
tail
and
lolled
his
tongue
and
now
and
then
he
licked
the
hand
of
a
baby
who
had
to
be
lifted
by
a
tall
brother
to
see
him
shy
kisses
were
dropped
on
bobby
head
by
toddling
bairns
and
awkward
caresses
by
rough
laddies
then
they
all
went
home
quietly
and
traill
carried
the
little
dog
around
the
kirk
and
there
ah
so
belated
auld
jock
grave
bore
its
tribute
of
flowers
wreaths
and
nosegays
potted
daffodils
and
primroses
and
daisies
covered
the
sunken
mound
so
that
some
of
them
had
to
be
moved
to
make
room
for
bobby
he
sniffed
and
sniffed
at
them
looked
up
inquiringly
at
traill
and
then
snuggled
down
contentedly
among
the
blossoms
he
did
not
understand
their
being
there
any
more
than
he
understood
the
collar
about
which
everybody
made
such
a
the
narrow
band
of
leather
would
disappear
under
his
thatch
again
and
would
be
unnoticed
by
the
casual
the
flowers
would
fade
and
never
be
so
lavishly
renewed
but
there
was
another
more
wonderful
gift
now
that
would
never
fail
him
at
nightfall
before
the
drum
and
bugle
sounded
the
tattoo
to
call
the
scattered
garrison
in
the
castle
there
took
place
a
loving
ceremony
that
was
never
afterward
omitted
as
long
as
bobby
lived
every
child
newly
come
to
the
tenements
learned
it
every
weanie
lisped
it
among
his
first
words
before
going
to
bed
each
bairn
opened
a
casement
sometimes
a
candle
was
held
up
a
little
star
of
love
glimmering
for
a
moment
on
the
dark
but
always
there
was
a
small
face
peering
into
the
melancholy
kirkyard
in
midsummer
and
at
other
seasons
if
the
moon
rose
full
and
early
and
the
sky
was
clear
bobby
could
be
seen
on
the
grave
and
when
he
recovered
from
these
hurts
he
trotted
about
making
the
circuit
below
the
windows
he
could
not
speak
there
because
he
had
been
forbidden
but
he
could
wag
his
tail
and
look
up
to
show
his
friendliness
and
whether
the
children
saw
him
or
not
they
knew
he
was
always
there
after
sunset
keeping
watch
and
ward
and
lanely
because
his
master
had
gone
away
to
heaven
and
so
they
called
out
to
him
sweetly
and
clearly
a
gude
nicht
to
ye
xii
in
one
thing
traill
had
been
mistaken
the
grand
folk
did
not
forget
bobby
at
the
end
of
five
years
the
leal
highlander
was
not
only
still
remembered
but
he
had
become
a
local
celebrity
had
the
grave
of
his
haunting
been
on
the
pentlands
or
in
one
of
the
outlying
cemeteries
of
the
city
bobby
must
have
been
known
to
few
of
his
generation
and
to
fame
not
at
all
but
among
churchyards
greyfriars
was
distinguished
one
of
the
historic
of
edinburgh
and
in
the
very
heart
of
the
old
town
it
was
never
missed
by
the
most
hurried
tourist
seldom
left
unvisited
from
year
to
year
by
the
oldest
resident
names
on
its
old
tombs
had
come
to
mean
nothing
to
those
who
read
them
except
as
they
recalled
memorable
records
of
love
of
inspiration
of
courage
of
and
this
being
so
it
touched
the
imagination
to
see
among
the
marbles
that
crumbled
toward
the
dust
below
a
living
embodiment
of
affection
and
fidelity
indeed
it
came
to
be
remarked
as
it
is
remarked
although
four
decades
have
gone
by
that
no
other
spot
in
greyfriars
was
so
much
cared
for
as
the
grave
of
a
man
of
whom
nothing
was
known
except
that
the
life
and
love
of
a
little
dog
was
consecrated
to
his
memory
at
almost
any
hour
bobby
might
be
found
there
as
he
grew
older
he
became
less
and
less
willing
to
be
long
absent
and
he
got
much
of
his
exercise
by
nosing
about
among
the
neighboring
thorns
in
fair
weather
he
took
his
frequent
naps
on
the
turf
above
his
master
or
he
sat
on
the
fallen
in
the
sun
on
foul
days
he
watched
the
grave
from
under
the
slab
and
to
that
spot
he
returned
from
every
skirmish
against
the
enemy
visitors
stopped
to
speak
to
him
favored
ones
were
permitted
to
read
the
inscription
on
his
collar
and
to
pat
his
head
it
seemed
therefore
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
when
the
greatest
lady
in
england
beside
the
queen
the
baroness
came
all
the
way
from
london
to
see
bobby
except
that
it
was
the
first
monday
in
june
and
founder
day
at
heriot
hospital
it
was
like
any
other
day
of
useful
work
innocent
pleasure
and
dreaming
dozes
on
auld
jock
grave
to
wee
bobby
as
years
go
the
shaggy
little
skye
was
an
old
dog
but
he
was
not
feeble
or
blind
or
unhappy
a
terrier
as
a
rule
does
not
live
as
long
as
more
sluggish
breeds
of
dogs
but
active
to
the
very
end
he
literally
wears
himself
out
tearing
around
and
then
goes
little
soldier
very
suddenly
dying
gallantly
with
his
boots
on
in
the
very
early
mornings
of
the
northern
summer
bobby
woke
with
the
birds
a
long
time
before
the
reveille
was
sounded
from
the
castle
he
scampered
down
to
the
circling
street
of
tombs
at
once
and
not
until
the
last
prowler
had
been
dispatched
or
frightened
into
his
burrow
did
he
return
for
a
brief
nap
on
auld
jock
grave
all
about
him
the
birds
fluttered
and
hopped
and
gossiped
and
foraged
unafraid
they
were
used
by
this
time
to
seeing
the
little
dog
lying
motionless
his
nose
on
his
paws
often
some
tidbit
of
food
lay
there
brought
for
bobby
by
a
stranger
he
had
learned
that
a
scotch
bun
dropped
near
him
was
a
feast
that
brought
feathered
visitors
about
and
won
their
confidence
and
cheerful
companionship
when
he
awoke
he
lay
there
lolling
and
blinking
following
the
blue
rovings
of
the
titmice
and
listening
to
the
foolish
squabbles
of
the
sparrows
and
the
shrewish
scoldings
of
the
wrens
he
always
started
when
a
lark
sprang
at
his
feet
and
a
cataract
of
melody
tumbled
from
the
sky
but
best
of
all
bobby
loved
a
comfortable
and
friendly
robin
redbreast
not
the
american
thrush
that
is
called
a
robin
but
the
smaller
old
world
warbler
it
had
its
nest
of
grass
and
moss
and
feathers
and
many
a
silver
hair
shed
by
bobby
low
in
a
thorn
bush
in
sweet
and
plaintive
talking
notes
it
told
its
little
dog
companion
all
about
the
babies
that
had
left
the
nest
and
the
new
brood
that
would
soon
be
there
on
the
morning
of
that
wonderful
day
of
the
grand
leddy
first
coming
bobby
and
the
redbreast
had
a
pleasant
visit
together
before
the
casements
began
to
open
and
the
tenement
bairns
called
down
their
morning
greeting
a
gude
day
to
ye
by
the
time
all
these
courtesies
had
been
returned
tammy
came
in
at
the
gate
with
his
college
books
strapped
on
his
back
the
old
cunzic
neuk
had
been
demolished
by
glenormiston
and
tammy
living
in
better
quarters
was
studying
to
be
a
teacher
at
heriot
bobby
saw
him
settled
and
then
he
had
to
escort
brown
down
from
the
lodge
the
caretaker
made
his
way
about
stiffly
with
a
cane
and
with
the
aid
of
a
young
helper
who
exasperated
the
old
gardener
by
his
cheerful
inefficiency
kept
the
auld
kirkyard
in
beautiful
order
eh
ye
tyke
he
said
to
bobby
in
transparent
pretense
of
his
uselessness
get
to
wark
or
i
hae
a
young
dog
in
to
gie
ye
a
lift
an
syne
whaur
ye
be
bobby
jumped
on
him
in
open
delight
at
this
as
much
as
to
say
ye
may
be
as
dour
as
ye
like
but
ilka
body
kens
ye
morning
and
evening
numerous
friends
passed
the
gate
and
the
wee
dog
waited
for
them
on
the
wicket
george
ross
and
alexander
mcgregor
shook
bobby
lifted
paw
and
called
him
a
sonsie
rascal
small
merchants
students
clerks
factory
workers
house
servants
laborers
and
vendors
all
honest
and
useful
people
had
come
up
out
of
these
old
tenements
within
bobby
memory
and
others
had
gone
down
alas
into
the
cowgate
but
bobby
tail
wagged
for
these
unfortunates
too
and
some
of
them
had
no
other
friend
in
the
world
beside
that
uncalculating
little
dog
when
the
morning
stream
of
auld
acquaintance
had
gone
by
and
none
forgot
bobby
went
up
to
the
lodge
to
sit
for
an
hour
with
mistress
jeanie
there
he
was
called
croodlin
doo
which
was
altogether
absurd
by
the
fond
old
woman
as
neat
of
plumage
and
as
busy
and
talkative
about
small
domestic
matters
as
the
robin
bobby
loved
to
watch
the
wifie
stirring
savory
messes
over
the
fire
watering
her
posies
cleaning
the
fluttering
skylark
cage
or
just
sitting
by
the
hearth
or
in
the
sunny
doorway
with
him
knitting
warm
stockings
for
her
rheumatic
out
in
the
kirkyard
bobby
trotted
dutifully
at
the
caretaker
heels
when
visitors
were
about
he
did
not
venture
to
take
a
nap
in
the
open
unless
brown
was
on
guard
and
by
long
and
close
companionship
with
him
the
aging
man
could
often
tell
what
bobby
was
dreaming
about
at
a
convulsive
movement
and
a
jerk
of
his
head
the
caretaker
would
say
to
the
wifie
if
she
chanced
to
be
near
leuk
at
that
noo
wull
ye
the
sperity
bit
was
takin
thae
and
again
when
the
muscles
of
his
legs
worked
rhythmically
he
rinnin
wi
the
laddies
or
the
braw
soldiers
on
the
bobby
often
woke
from
a
dream
with
a
start
looked
dazed
and
then
foolish
at
the
vivid
imaginings
of
sleep
but
when
in
a
doze
he
half
stretched
himself
up
on
his
short
shagged
fore
paws
flattened
out
and
then
awoke
and
lay
so
very
still
for
a
time
it
was
mistress
jeanie
who
said
preserve
us
a
the
bonny
wee
was
dreamin
o
his
maister
deith
noo
he
greetin
at
that
she
took
her
little
stool
and
sat
on
the
grave
beside
him
but
brown
bit
his
teeth
in
his
pipe
limped
away
and
stormed
at
his
daft
helper
laddie
who
did
appear
to
know
a
violet
from
a
burdock
ah
who
can
doubt
that
so
deeply
were
scene
and
word
graven
on
his
memory
bobby
often
lived
again
the
hour
of
his
bereavement
and
heard
auld
jock
last
words
gang
awa
hame
laddie
homeless
on
earth
gude
auld
jock
had
gone
to
a
place
prepared
for
him
but
his
faithful
little
dog
had
no
home
this
sacred
spot
was
merely
his
tarrying
place
where
he
waited
until
such
a
time
as
that
mysterious
door
should
open
for
him
perchance
to
an
equal
sky
and
he
could
slip
through
and
find
his
master
on
the
morning
of
the
day
when
the
grand
leddy
came
bobby
watched
the
holiday
crowd
gather
on
heriot
hospital
grounds
the
mothers
and
sisters
of
hundreds
of
boys
were
there
looking
on
at
the
great
match
game
of
cricket
bobby
dropped
over
the
wall
and
scampered
about
taking
a
merry
part
in
the
play
when
the
pupils
procession
was
formed
and
the
long
line
of
grinning
and
nudging
laddies
marched
in
to
service
in
the
chapel
and
dinner
in
the
hall
he
was
set
up
over
the
kirkyard
wall
hundreds
of
hands
were
waved
to
him
and
voices
called
back
fareweel
bobby
then
the
boomed
from
the
castle
and
the
little
dog
trotted
up
for
his
dinner
and
nap
under
the
settle
and
his
daily
visit
with
traill
in
fair
weather
when
the
last
guest
had
departed
and
the
music
bells
of
giles
had
ceased
playing
the
landlord
was
fond
of
standing
in
his
doorway
bareheaded
and
in
and
apron
to
exchange
opinions
on
politics
literature
and
religion
or
to
tell
bobby
story
to
what
he
could
beguile
into
talk
at
his
feet
there
was
a
fine
place
for
a
sociable
little
dog
to
spend
an
hour
when
he
was
ready
to
go
bobby
set
his
paws
upon
traill
and
waited
for
the
landlord
hand
to
be
laid
on
his
head
and
the
man
to
say
in
the
dialect
the
little
dog
best
understood
bide
a
wee
ye
no
needin
to
gang
sae
sune
laddie
at
that
he
dropped
barked
politely
wagged
his
tail
and
was
off
if
traill
really
wanted
to
detain
bobby
he
had
only
to
withhold
the
magic
word
laddie
that
no
one
else
had
used
toward
the
little
dog
since
auld
jock
died
but
if
the
word
was
too
long
in
coming
bobby
would
thrash
his
tail
about
impatiently
look
up
appealingly
and
finally
rise
and
beg
and
whimper
weel
then
bide
wi
me
an
ye
get
it
ilka
hour
o
the
day
ye
sonsie
wee
talon
bit
what
are
ye
hangin
aroond
for
eh
weel
gang
awa
wi
ye
laddie
the
landlord
sighed
and
looked
down
reproachfully
with
a
delighted
yelp
and
a
lick
of
the
lingering
hand
bobby
was
off
it
was
after
three
on
this
day
when
he
returned
to
the
kirkyard
the
caretaker
was
working
at
the
upper
end
and
the
little
dog
was
lonely
but
long
enough
absent
from
his
master
bobby
lay
down
on
the
grave
in
the
stillness
of
the
the
robin
made
a
brief
call
and
as
no
other
birds
were
about
hopped
upon
bobby
back
perched
on
his
head
and
warbled
a
little
song
it
was
then
that
the
gate
clicked
dismissing
her
carriage
and
telling
the
coachman
to
return
at
five
lady
entered
the
kirkyard
bobby
trotted
around
the
kirk
on
the
chance
of
meeting
a
friend
he
looked
up
intently
at
the
strange
lady
for
a
moment
and
she
stood
still
and
looked
down
at
him
she
was
not
a
beautiful
lady
nor
very
young
indeed
she
was
a
few
years
older
than
the
queen
and
the
queen
was
a
widowed
grandmother
but
she
had
a
sweet
dignity
and
warm
serenity
an
unhurried
look
as
if
she
had
all
the
time
in
the
world
for
a
wee
dog
and
bobby
was
an
muff
of
a
plaintive
terrier
that
captured
her
heart
at
once
very
certain
that
this
stranger
knew
and
cared
about
how
he
felt
bobby
turned
and
led
her
down
to
auld
jock
grave
and
when
she
was
seated
on
the
he
came
up
to
her
and
let
her
look
at
his
collar
and
he
stood
under
her
caress
although
she
spoke
to
him
in
fey
english
calling
him
a
darling
little
dog
then
entirely
contented
with
her
company
he
lay
down
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
and
lolling
his
tongue
the
sun
was
on
the
green
and
flowery
slope
of
greyfriars
warming
the
weathered
tombs
and
the
rear
windows
of
the
tenements
the
grand
leddy
found
a
great
deal
there
to
interest
her
beside
bobby
and
the
robin
that
chirped
and
picked
up
crumbs
between
the
little
dog
paws
presently
the
gate
was
opened
again
and
a
housemaid
from
some
mansion
in
george
square
came
around
the
kirk
trained
by
mistress
jeanie
she
was
a
neat
and
pretty
and
housemaid
in
a
black
gown
and
white
apron
and
with
a
frilled
cap
on
her
crinkly
hair
that
had
had
more
than
a
lick
or
twa
the
nicht
it
juist
ailie
bobby
seemed
to
say
as
he
stood
a
moment
with
crested
neck
and
tail
ilka
body
kens
the
servant
lassie
with
an
hour
out
had
stopped
to
speak
to
bobby
she
had
not
meant
to
stay
long
but
the
lady
who
did
look
in
the
least
grand
began
to
think
friendly
things
aloud
the
windows
of
the
tenements
are
very
ay
the
bairnies
couldna
see
bobby
gin
the
windows
warna
the
lassie
was
pulling
her
adored
little
pet
ears
and
bobby
was
nuzzling
up
to
her
in
many
of
the
windows
there
is
a
box
of
flowers
or
of
kitchen
herbs
to
make
the
broth
it
wasna
so
i
the
auld
days
it
was
aye
washin

the
bairnies
haen
bobby
to
an
no
to

she
continued
the
conversation
to
include
tammy
as
he
came
around
the
kirk
on
his
tapping
crutches
hoo
mony
years
is
it
tammy
sin
bobby
been
leevin
i
the
auld
kirkyaird
at
maister
traill
snawy
picnic
ye
war
five
gangin
on
they
exchanged
glances
in
which
lay
one
of
the
happy
memories
of
sad
childhoods
noo
i
nineteen
going
on
twenty
it
near
fourteen
years
syne
nearly
all
the
burrs
had
been
pulled
from
tammy
tongue
but
he
used
a
scotch
word
now
and
then
no
to
shame
ailie
less
cultivated
speech
so
long
murmured
the
grand
leddy
bobby
is
getting
old
very
old
for
a
as
if
to
deny
that
bobby
suddenly
shot
down
the
slope
in
answer
to
a
cry
of
alarm
from
a
song
thrush
still
good
for
a
dash
when
he
came
back
he
dropped
panting
the
lady
put
her
hand
on
his
rippling
coat
and
felt
his
heart
pounding
then
she
looked
at
his
worn
down
teeth
and
lifted
his
veil
much
of
the
luster
was
gone
from
bobby
brown
eyes
but
they
were
still
soft
and
deep
and
appealing
from
the
windows
children
looked
down
upon
the
quiet
group
and
without
in
the
least
knowing
why
they
wanted
to
be
there
too
the
tenement
bairns
began
to
drop
into
the
kirkyard
almost
at
once
it
rained
a
quick
bright
dashing
shower
that
sent
them
all
flying
and
laughing
up
to
the
shelter
of
the
portico
to
the
new
kirk
bobby
scampered
up
too
and
with
the
bairns
in
holiday
duddies
crowding
about
her
and
the
wee
dog
lolling
at
her
feet
the
grand
leddy
talked
fairy
stories
she
told
them
all
about
a
pretty
country
place
near
london
it
was
called
holly
lodge
because
its
hedges
were
bright
with
green
leaves
and
red
berries
even
in
winter
a
lady
who
had
no
family
at
all
lived
there
and
to
keep
her
company
she
had
all
sorts
of
pets
peter
and
prince
were
the
dearest
dogs
and
cocky
was
a
parrot
that
could
say
the
most
amusing
things
sir
garnet
was
the
llama
goat
or
sheep
she
did
know
which
there
was
a
fat
and
lazy
old
pony
that
had
long
been
pensioned
off
on
oats
and
clover
and
oh
yes
the
white
donkey
must
not
be
forgotten
i
didna
ken
there
wad
be
ony
white
donkeys
cried
a
laddie
there
can
not
be
many
and
there
a
story
about
how
the
lady
came
to
have
this
one
one
day
driving
in
a
poor
street
she
saw
a
coster
that
is
a
london
peddler
beating
his
tired
donkey
that
refused
to
pull
the
load
the
lady
got
out
of
her
carriage
fed
the
animal
some
carrots
from
the
cart
talked
kindly
to
him
right
into
his
big
surprised
ear
and
stroked
his
nose
presently
the
poor
beast
felt
better
and
started
off
cheerfully
with
the
heavy
cart
when
many
costers
learned
that
it
was
not
only
wicked
but
foolish
to
abuse
their
patient
animals
they
hunted
for
a
white
donkey
to
give
the
lady
they
put
a
collar
of
flowers
about
his
neck
and
brought
him
up
on
a
platform
before
a
crowd
of
people
everybody
laughed
for
he
was
a
clumsy
and
comical
beast
to
be
decorated
with
roses
and
daisies
but
the
lady
is
proud
of
him
and
now
that
pampered
donkey
has
nothing
to
do
but
pull
her
bath
chair
about
when
she
is
at
holly
lodge
and
kick
up
his
heels
on
a
clover
are
ye
kennin
anither
tale
leddy
oh
a
number
of
them
prince
the
fox
terrier
was
ill
once
and
the
doctor
who
came
to
see
him
said
his
mistress
gave
him
too
much
to
eat
that
was
very
probable
because
that
lady
likes
to
see
children
and
animals
have
too
much
to
eat
there
are
dozens
and
dozens
of
poor
children
that
the
lady
knows
and
loves
once
they
lived
in
a
very
dark
and
dirty
and
crowded
tenement
quite
as
bad
as
some
that
were
torn
down
in
the
cowgate
and
the
it
mak
ye
fecht
ane
anither
said
one
laddie
soberly
gin

had
a
sonsie
doggie
like
bobby

an
an
auld
kirkyaird
wi
posies
birdies
to
leuk
into
they
wadna
fecht
sae
i
very
sure
of
that
well
the
lady
built
a
new
tenement
with
plenty
of
room
and
light
and
air
and
a
market
so
they
can
get
better
food
more
cheaply
and
a
large
church
that
is
also
a
kind
of
school
where
big
and
little
people
can
learn
many
things
she
gives
the
children
of
the
neighborhood
a
christmas
dinner
and
a
gay
tree
and
she
strips
the
hedges
of
holly
lodge
for
them
and
then
she
takes
peter
and
prince
and
cocky
the
parrot
to
help
along
the
fun
and
she
tells
her
newest
stories
next
christmas
she
means
to
tell
the
story
of
greyfriars
bobby
and
how
all
his
little
scotch
friends
are
and
cleaner
and
happier
because
they
have
that
wee
dog

ilka
body
bobby
he
wasna

ailie
thoughtfully
oh

the
very
best
part
of
the
story
the
grand
leddy
had
a
shining
look
the
rain
had
ceased
and
the
sun
come
out
and
the
children
began
to
be
called
away
there
was
quite
a
little
ceremony
of
lingering
with
the
lady
and
with
bobby
and
while
this
was
going
on
ailie
had
a
sairious
confidence
for
her
old
playfellow

to
be
buried
i
the
will
he
not
i
had
not
thought
of
her
tone
was
at
once
hushed
and
startled
then
she
was
down
in
the
grass
brooding
over
the
little
dog
and
bobby
had
the
pathetic
look
of
trying
to
understand
what
this
emotional
talk
that
seemed
to
concern
himself
was
about
tammy
and
ailie
were
down
too
are
ye
thinkin
bobby
wall
be
kennin
the
deeference
ailie
bluebell
eyes
were
wide
at
the
thought
of
pain
for
this
little
pet
i
do
not
know
my
dear
but
there
can
not
well
be
more
love
in
this
world
than
there
is
room
for
in
god
she
was
silent
all
the
way
to
the
gate
some
thought
in
her
mind
already
working
toward
a
gracious
deed
at
the
last
she
said
the
little
dog
is
fond
of
you
both
be
with
him
all
you
can
for
i
think
his
beautiful
life
is
near
its
after
a
pause
during
which
her
face
was
lighted
by
a
smile
as
if
from
a
lovely
thought
within
she
added
do
let
bobby
die
before
my
return
from
in
a
week
she
was
back
and
in
the
meantime
letters
and
telegrams
had
been
flying
and
many
wheels
set
in
motion
in
wee
bobby
affairs
when
she
returned
to
the
churchyard
very
early
one
morning
no
less
a
person
than
the
lord
provost
himself
was
with
her
five
years
had
passed
but
no
sir
william
chambers
laird
of
glenormiston
for
he
had
been
knighted
by
the
queen
was
still
lord
provost
of
edinburgh
almost
immediately
traill
appeared
by
appointment
and
was
made
all
but
speechless
for
once
in
his
loquacious
life
by
the
honor
of
being
asked
to
tell
bobby
story
to
the
baroness
but
not
even
a
tenement
child
or
a
london
coster
could
be
ill
at
ease
with
the
grand
leddy
for
very
long
and
presently
the
three
were
in
close
conference
in
the
portico
bobby
welcomed
them
and
then
dozed
in
the
sun
and
visited
with
the
robin
on
auld
jock
grave
far
from
being
the
landlord
was
inspired
what
did
he
not
remember
from
the
pathetic
renunciation
bobby
isna
ma
ain
dog
down
to
the
leal
last
near
tragic
reminder
to
men
that
in
the
nameless
grave
lay
his
unforgotten
master
he
sketched
the
scene
in
haddo
hole
where
the
tenement
bairns
poured
out
as
pure
a
gift
of
love
and
mercy
and
as
had
ever
been
laid
at
the
foot
of
a
scottish
altar
he
told
of
the
search
for
the
lately
ransomed
and
lost
terrier
by
the
lavish
use
of
oil
and
candles
of
bobby
coming
down
castle
rock
in
the
fog
battered
and
bruised
for
a
month
careful
tending
by
an
old
heriot
laddie
his
feet
still
showed
the
scars
of
that
perilous
descent
he
himself
remorseful
had
gone
with
the
biblereader
from
the
medical
mission
in
the
cowgate
to
the
closet
in
college
wynd
where
auld
jock
had
died
now
he
described
the
classic
fireplace
of
white
freestone
with
its
bed
where
the
pentland
shepherd
lay
like
some
effigy
on
a
bier
with
the
wee
guardian
dog
stretched
on
the
flagged
hearth
below
what
a
subject
for
a
monument
the
grand
leddy
looked
across
the
top
of
the
slope
at
the
sleeping
skye
i
suppose
there
is
no
portrait
of
ay
your
leddyship
i
have
a
drawing
in
the
dining
rooms
sketched
by
daniel
maclise
he
was
here
a
year
or
twa
ago
just
before
his
death
doing
some
commission
and
often
had
his
tea
in
my
bit
place
i
told
him
bobby
story
and
he
made
the
sketch
for
me
as
a
souvenir
of
his
i
am
sure
you
prize
it
traill
maclise
was
a
talented
artist
but
he
was
not
especially
an
animal
painter
there
really
is
no
one
since
landseer
paints
no
i
would
advise
you
baroness
not
to
make
that
remark
at
an
edinburgh
glenormiston
was
smiling
the
pride
of
auld
reekie
just
now
is
gourlay
stelle
who
was
lately
commanded
to
balmoral
castle
to
paint
the
queen
the
very
person
i
have
seen
his
beautiful
canvas
and
the
field
mouse
is
he
not
a
younger
brother
of
sir
john
stelle
the
sculptor
of
the
statue
and
character
figures
in
the
scott
monument
her
eyes
sparkled
as
she
added
you
have
so
much
talent
of
the
right
sorts
here
that
it
would
be
wicked
not
to
employ
it
in
the
good
what
the
good
cause
was
came
out
presently
in
the
church
where
she
startled
even
glenormiston
and
traill
by
saying
quietly
to
the
minister
and
the
church
officers
of
greyfriars
auld
kirk
when
bobby
dies
i
want
him
laid
in
the
grave
with
his
every
member
of
both
congregations
knew
bobby
and
was
proud
of
his
fame
but
no
official
notice
had
ever
been
taken
of
the
little
dog
presence
in
the
churchyard
the
elders
and
deacons
were
in
truth
surprised
that
such
distinguished
attention
should
be
directed
to
him
now
and
they
were
embarrassed
by
it
it
was
not
easy
for
any
body
of
men
in
the
united
kingdom
to
refuse
anything
to
lady
because
she
could
always
count
upon
having
the
sympathy
of
the
public
but
this
they
declared
could
not
be
considered
to
propose
to
bury
a
dog
in
the
historic
churchyard
would
scandalize
the
city
to
this
objection
glenormiston
said
seriously
the
feeling
about
bobby
is
quite
exceptional
i
would
be
willing
to
put
the
matter
to
the
test
of
heading
a
at
that
the
church
officers
threw
up
their
hands
they
preferred
to
sound
public
sentiment
themselves
and
would
consider
it
but
if
bobby
was
permitted
to
be
buried
with
his
master
there
must
be
no
notice
taken
of
it
well
the
heriot
laddies
might
line
up
along
the
wall
and
the
tenement
bairns
look
down
from
the
windows
would
that
satisfy
her
ladyship
as
far
as
it
the
grand
leddy
was
smiling
but
a
little
tremulous
about
the
mouth
that
was
a
day
when
women
had
little
to
say
in
public
and
she
meant
to
make
a
speech
and
to
ask
to
be
allowed
to
do
an
thing
i
want
to
put
up
a
monument
to
the
nameless
man
who
inspired
such
love
and
to
the
little
dog
that
was
capable
of
giving
it
ah
gentlemen
do
not
refuse
she
sketched
her
idea
of
the
classic
fireplace
bier
the
dead
shepherd
of
the
pentlands
and
the
little
prostrate
terrier
immemorial
man
and
his
faithful
dog
our
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
animals
is
finding
it
so
hard
to
get
people
even
to
admit
the
sacredness
of
life
in
dumb
creatures
the
brutalizing
effects
of
abuse
of
them
on
human
beings
and
the
moral
and
practical
worth
to
us
of
kindness
to
insist
that
a
dog
feels
that
he
loves
devotedly
and
with
less
calculation
than
men
that
he
grieves
at
a
master
death
and
remembers
him
long
years
brings
a
smile
of
amusement
ah
yes
here
in
scotland
too
where
your
own
great
lord
erskine
was
a
pioneer
of
pity
two
generations
ago
and
with
sir
walter
dogs
beloved
of
the
literary
and
doctor
brown
immortal
we
find
it
uphill
work
the
story
of
greyfriars
bobby
is
quite
the
most
complete
and
remarkable
ever
recorded
in
dog
annals
his
lifetime
of
devotion
has
been
witnessed
by
thousands
and
honored
publicly
by
your
own
lord
provost
with
the
freedom
of
the
city
a
thing
that
i
believe
has
no
precedent
all
the
endearing
qualities
of
the
dog
reach
their
height
in
this
loyal
and
lovable
highland
terrier
and
he
seems
to
have
brought
out
the
best
qualities
of
the
people
who
have
known
him
indeed
for
fourteen
years
hundreds
of
disinherited
children
have
been
made
kinder
and
happier
by
knowing
bobby
story
and
having
that
little
dog
to
she
stopped
in
some
embarrassment
seeing
how
she
had
let
herself
go
in
this
warm
championship
and
then
she
added
bobby
does
not
need
a
monument
but
i
think
we
need
one
of
him
that
future
generations
may
never
forget
what
the
love
of
a
dog
may
mean
to
himself
and
to
the
grand
leddy
must
have
won
her
plea
then
and
there
but
for
the
fact
that
the
matter
of
erecting
a
monument
of
a
public
character
anywhere
in
the
city
had
to
come
up
before
the
burgh
council
in
that
body
the
stubborn
opposition
of
a
few
members
unexpectedly
developed
and
in
spite
of
popular
sympathy
with
the
proposal
the
plan
was
rejected
permission
was
given
however
for
lady
to
put
up
a
suitable
memorial
to
bobby
at
the
end
of
george
iv
bridge
and
opposite
the
main
gateway
to
the
kirkyard
for
such
a
public
place
a
tomb
was
unsuitable
what
form
the
memorial
was
to
take
was
not
decided
upon
until
because
of
two
chance
happenings
of
one
morning
the
form
of
it
bloomed
like
a
flower
in
the
soul
of
the
grand
leddy
she
had
come
down
to
the
kirkyard
to
watch
the
artist
at
work
morning
after
morning
he
had
sketched
there
he
had
drawn
bobby
lying
down
his
nose
on
his
paws
asleep
on
the
grave
he
had
drawn
him
sitting
upon
the
and
standing
in
the
begging
attitude
in
which
he
was
so
irresistible
but
with
every
sketch
he
was
dissatisfied
bobby
was
a
trying
and
deceptive
subject
he
had
the
air
of
curiosity
and
gaiety
of
other
terriers
he
saw
no
sense
at
all
in
keeping
still
with
his
muzzle
tipped
up
or
down
and
his
tail
held
just
so
he
brushed
all
that
unreasonable
man
suggestions
aside
as
quite
unworthy
of
consideration
besides
he
had
the
liveliest
interest
in
the
astonishing
little
dog
that
grew
and
disappeared
and
came
back
in
some
new
attitude
on
the
canvas
he
scraped
acquaintance
with
it
once
or
twice
to
the
damage
of
fresh
he
was
always
jumping
from
his
pose
and
running
around
the
easel
to
see
how
the
latest
dog
was
coming
on
after
a
number
of
mornings
bobby
lost
interest
in
the
man
and
his
occupation
and
went
about
his
ordinary
routine
of
life
as
if
the
artist
was
not
there
at
all
one
morning
the
wee
terrier
was
found
sitting
on
the
on
his
haunches
looking
up
toward
the
castle
where
clouds
and
birds
were
blown
around
the
battlements
his
attitude
might
have
meant
anything
or
nothing
for
the
man
who
looked
at
him
from
above
could
not
see
his
expression
and
all
at
once
he
realized
that
to
see
bobby
a
human
being
must
get
down
to
his
level
to
the
scandal
of
the
children
he
lay
on
his
back
on
the
grass
and
did
nothing
at
all
but
look
up
at
bobby
until
the
little
dog
moved
then
he
set
the
wee
highlander
up
on
an
shaft
just
above
the
level
of
the
human
eye
indifferent
at
the
moment
as
to
what
was
done
to
him
bobby
continued
to
gaze
up
and
out
wistfully
and
patiently
upon
this
masterless
world
as
plainly
as
a
little
dog
could
speak
bobby
said
i
hae
bided
lang
an
lanely
hoo
lang
hae
i
still
to
bide
an
syne
wull
i
be
gangin
to
auld
jock
the
grand
leddy
saw
that
at
once
and
tears
started
to
her
eyes
when
she
came
in
to
find
the
artist
sketching
with
feverish
rapidity
she
confessed
that
she
had
looked
into
bobby
eyes
but
she
had
never
truly
seen
that
mourning
little
creature
before
he
had
only
to
be
set
up
so
in
bronze
and
looking
through
the
kirkyard
gate
to
tell
his
own
story
to
the
most
careless
passerby
the
image
of
the
simple
memorial
was
clear
in
her
mind
and
it
seemed
unlikely
that
anything
could
be
added
to
it
when
she
left
the
kirkyard
as
she
was
getting
into
her
carriage
a
noble
collie
but
one
with
a
discouraged
tail
and
hanging
tongue
came
out
of
forest
road
he
had
done
a
hard
morning
work
of
driving
a
flock
from
the
pentlands
to
the
cattle
and
sheep
market
and
then
had
hunted
far
and
unsuccessfully
for
water
he
nosed
along
the
gutter
here
and
there
licking
from
the
cobblestones
what
muddy
moisture
had
not
drained
away
from
a
recent
rain
the
same
lady
who
had
fed
the
carrots
to
the
coster
donkey
in
london
turned
hastily
into
ye
olde
greyfriars
and
asked
traill
for
a
basin
of
water
the
landlord
thought
he
must
have
misunderstood
her
is
it
a
glass
of
water
your
leddyship
wanting
no
a
basin
please
a
large
one
and
very
she
took
it
from
him
hurried
out
and
set
it
under
the
thirsty
nose
the
collie
lapped
it
eagerly
until
the
water
was
gone
then
looked
up
and
by
waggings
and
lickings
asked
for
more
traill
brought
out
a
second
basin
and
he
remarked
upon
a
capacity
for
water
it
no
a
basin
will
satisfy
him
used
as
he
is
to
having
a
tam
on
the
moor
to
drink
from
this
neeborhood
is
noted
for
the
dogs
that
are
aye
passing
on
wednesdays
the
farm
dogs
come
up
from
the
grassmarket
and
every
day
there
are
dogs
from
the
residence
streets
dogs
of
all
conditions
across
the
bridge
from
high
street
and
meeserable
waifs
from
the
cowgate
stray
pussies
are
about
too
i
a
man
and
an
unco
observant
one
your
leddyship
but
i
was
no
thinking
that
these
animals
must
often
suffer
from
few
people
do
think
of
it
most
men
can
love
some
one
dog
or
cat
or
horse
and
be
attentive
to
its
wants
but
they
take
little
thought
for
the
world
of
dumb
animals
that
are
so
dependent
upon
us
it
is
no
special
credit
to
you
traill
that
you
became
fond
of
an
attractive
little
dog
like
bobby
and
have
cared
for
him
so
the
landlord
gasped
he
had
taken
not
a
little
pride
in
his
stanch
championship
and
watchful
care
of
bobby
and
his
pride
had
been
increased
by
the
admiration
that
had
been
lavished
on
him
for
years
by
the
general
public
now
as
he
afterward
confessed
to
brown
her
leddyship
made
me
feel
i
done
naething
by
the
ordinar
but
maistly
to
please
my
ainsel
eh
man
she
made
me
sing
when
the
collie
had
finished
drinking
he
looked
up
gratefully
rubbed
against
the
good
samaritans
waved
his
plumed
tail
like
a
banner
and
trotted
away
after
a
thoughtful
moment
lady
said
the
suitable
memorial
here
traill
is
a
fountain
with
a
low
basin
level
with
the
curb
and
a
higher
one
and
bobby
sitting
on
an
central
column
above
looking
through
the
kirkyard
gate
it
shall
be
his
mission
to
bring
men
and
small
animals
together
in
sympathy
by
offering
to
both
the
cup
of
cold
she
was
there
once
again
that
year
on
her
way
north
she
stopped
in
edinburgh
over
night
to
see
how
the
work
on
the
fountain
had
progressed
it
was
in
scotland
best
season
most
of
the
days
dry
and
bright
and
sharp
but
on
that
day
it
was
misting
and
yellow
leaves
were
dropping
on
the
wet
tombs
and
beaded
grass
when
the
grand
leddy
appeared
at
the
kirkyard
late
in
the
afternoon
with
a
wreath
of
laurel
to
lay
on
auld
jock
grave
bobby
slipped
out
dry
as
his
own
delectable
bone
from
under
the
tomb
of
mistress
jean
grant
and
nearly
wagged
his
tail
off
with
pleasure
mistress
jeanie
was
set
in
a
proud
flutter
when
the
grand
leddy
rang
at
the
lodge
kitchen
and
asked
if
she
and
bobby
could
have
their
tea
there
with
the
old
couple
by
the
cozy
grate
fire
they
all
drank
tea
from
the
best
blue
cups
and
ate
buttered
scones
and
strawberry
jam
on
the
scoured
deal
table
bobby
had
his
porridge
and
broth
on
the
hearth
the
coals
snapped
in
the
grate
and
the
firelight
danced
merrily
on
the
skylark
cage
and
the
copper
kettle
brown
got
out
his
fife
and
played
bonnie
wee
bobby
tried
to
dance
but
he
tumbled
over
so
lamentably
once
or
twice
that
he
hung
his
head
apologetically
admitting
that
he
ought
to
have
the
sense
to
know
that
his
dancing
days
were
done
he
lay
down
and
lolled
and
blinked
on
the
hearth
until
the
grand
leddy
rose
to
go
i
am
on
my
way
to
braemar
to
visit
for
a
few
days
at
balmoral
castle
i
wish
i
could
take
bobby
with
me
to
show
him
to
the
dear
preserve
me
cried
mistress
jeanie
and
brown
pet
pipe
was
in
fragments
on
the
hearth
bobby
leaped
upon
her
and
whimpered
saying
dinna
gang
leddy
as
plainly
as
a
little
dog
could
say
anything
he
showed
the
pathos
at
parting
with
one
he
was
fond
of
now
that
an
old
and
affectionate
person
shows
he
clung
to
her
gown
rubbed
his
rough
head
under
her
hand
and
trotted
disconsolately
beside
her
to
her
waiting
carriage
at
the
very
last
she
said
sadly
the
queen
will
have
to
come
to
edinburgh
to
see
the
bonny
wee
wad
be
a
prood
doggie
yer
leddyship
mistress
jeanie
managed
to
stammer
but
brown
was
beyond
speech
the
grand
leddy
said
nothing
she
looked
at
the
foundation
work
of
bobby
memorial
fountain
swathed
in
canvas
against
the
winter
and
waiting
waiting
for
the
spring
when
the
waters
of
the
earth
should
be
unsealed
again
waiting
until
finis
could
be
written
to
a
story
on
a
bronze
waiting
for
the
effigy
of
a
shaggy
skye
terrier
to
be
cast
and
set
up
waiting
when
the
queen
came
to
see
bobby
it
was
unlikely
that
he
would
know
anything
about
it
he
would
know
nothing
of
the
crowds
to
gather
there
on
a
public
occasion
massing
on
the
bridge
in
greyfriars
place
in
broad
chambers
street
and
down
candlemakers
row
the
magistrates
and
burgh
council
professors
and
students
from
the
university
soldiers
from
the
castle
the
neighboring
nobility
in
carriages
farmers
and
shepherds
from
the
pentlands
the
heriot
laddies
marching
from
the
school
and
the
tenement
children
in
holiday
duddies
all
to
honor
the
memory
of
a
devoted
little
dog
he
would
know
nothing
of
the
military
music
and
flowers
the
prayer
of
the
minister
of
greyfriars
auld
kirk
the
speech
of
the
lord
provost
nothing
of
the
happy
tears
of
the
grand
leddy
when
a
veil
should
fall
away
from
a
little
bronze
dog
that
gazed
wistfully
through
the
kirkyard
gate
and
water
gush
forth
for
the
refreshment
of
men
and
animals
bobby
most
loving
and
lovable
darlingest
wee
dog
in
the
world
she
cried
and
a
shower
of
bright
drops
and
sweet
little
sounds
fell
on
bobby
tousled
head
then
the
carriage
of
the
grand
leddy
rolled
away
in
the
rainy
dusk
the
of
giles
was
rung
and
the
sunset
bugle
blown
in
the
castle
it
took
brown
a
long
time
to
lift
the
wicket
close
the
tall
leaves
and
lock
the
gate
the
wind
was
rising
and
the
air
hardening
one
after
one
the
gas
lamps
flared
in
the
gusts
that
blew
on
the
bridge
the
huge
bulk
of
shadow
lay
velvet
black
in
the
drenched
quarry
pit
of
the
grassmarket
the
caretaker
voice
was
husky
with
a
sudden
cauld
in
ye
an
auld
dog
bobby
an
ye
canna
deny
it
ye
juist
hae
to
sleep
i
the
hoose
the
misty
loath
to
part
with
them
bobby
went
up
to
the
lodge
with
the
old
couple
and
saw
them
within
the
cheerful
kitchen
but
when
the
door
was
held
open
for
him
he
wagged
his
tail
in
farewell
and
trotted
away
around
the
kirk
all
the
concession
he
was
willing
to
make
to
old
age
and
bad
weather
was
to
sleep
under
the
fallen
greyfriars
on
a
dripping
autumn
evening
a
pensive
hour
and
season
everything
memorable
brooded
there
crouched
back
in
shadowy
ranks
the
old
tombs
were
draped
in
mystery
the
mist
was
swirled
by
the
wind
and
smoke
smeared
out
over
their
dim
shapes
where
families
sat
close
about
scant
suppers
the
lights
of
candles
and
cruisey
lamps
were
blurred
the
faintest
halo
hung
above
the
castle
head
infrequent
footsteps
hurried
by
the
gate
there
was
the
rattle
of
a
belated
cart
the
ring
of
a
distant
church
bell
but
even
on
such
nights
the
casements
were
opened
and
little
faces
looked
into
the
melancholy
kirkyard
candles
glimmered
for
a
moment
on
the
murk
and
sweetly
and
clearly
the
tenement
bairns
called
down
a
gude
nicht
to
ye
they
could
not
see
the
little
dog
but
they
knew
he
was
there
they
knew
now
that
he
would
still
be
there
when
they
could
see
him
no
more
his
body
a
part
of
the
soil
his
memory
a
part
of
all
that
was
held
dear
and
imperishable
in
that
old
garden
of
souls
they
could
go
up
to
the
lodge
and
look
at
his
famous
collar
and
they
would
have
his
image
in
bronze
on
the
fountain
and
sometime
when
the
mysterious
door
opened
for
them
they
might
see
bobby
again
a
sonsie
doggie
running
on
the
green
pastures
and
beside
the
still
waters
at
the
heels
of
his
shepherd
master
for
if
there
is
not
more
love
in
this
world
than
there
is
room
for
in
heaven
bobby
would
just
have
gaen
awa
hame
