preface
having
passed
the
half
century
mark
in
life
journey
and
yielding
to
persistent
requests
of
many
old
and
valued
friends
of
the
past
and
present
i
have
decided
to
write
the
record
of
slave
cowboy
and
pullman
porter
will
prove
of
interest
to
the
reading
public
generally
and
particularly
to
those
who
prefer
facts
to
fiction
and
in
this
case
again
facts
will
prove
stranger
than
fiction
i
assure
my
readers
that
every
event
chronicled
in
this
history
is
based
on
facts
and
my
personal
experiences
of
more
than
fifty
years
of
an
unusually
adventurous
life
while
many
things
contained
in
this
record
happened
many
years
ago
they
are
as
fresh
in
my
memory
as
if
they
happened
but
yesterday
i
have
tried
to
record
events
simply
as
they
are
without
attempting
to
varnish
over
the
bad
spots
or
draw
on
my
imagination
to
fill
out
a
chapter
at
the
cost
of
the
truth
it
has
been
my
aim
to
record
things
just
as
they
happened
believing
they
will
prove
of
greater
interest
thereby
and
if
i
am
able
to
add
to
the
interest
and
enjoyment
of
a
single
reader
i
will
consider
myself
well
repaid
for
the
time
and
labor
of
preparing
this
history
to
my
playmates
of
my
boyhood
who
may
chance
to
read
this
i
send
greetings
and
wish
them
well
to
the
few
friends
who
assisted
myself
and
widowed
mother
in
our
early
struggles
i
tender
my
sincerest
thanks
and
hope
they
have
prospered
as
they
deserve
for
those
who
proved
our
enemies
i
have
no
word
of
censure
they
have
reaped
their
reward
to
that
noble
but
ever
decreasing
band
of
men
under
whose
blue
and
buckskin
shirts
there
lives
a
soul
as
great
and
beats
a
heart
as
true
as
ever
human
breast
contained
to
the
cowboys
rangers
scouts
hunters
and
trappers
and
of
the
great
western
plains
i
extend
the
hand
of
greeting
acknowledging
the
of
god
and
the
brotherhood
of
men
and
to
my
mother
sainted
name

slavery
days

my
first
drink
the
curse
of
slavery
in
an
old
log
cabin
on
my
master
plantation
in
davidson
county
in
tennessee
in
june
i
first
saw
the
light
of
day
the
exact
date
of
my
birth
i
never
knew
because
in
those
days
no
count
was
kept
of
such
trivial
matters
as
the
birth
of
a
slave
baby
they
were
born
and
died
and
the
account
was
balanced
in
the
gains
and
losses
of
the
chattels
and
one
more
or
less
did
not
matter
much
one
way
or
another
my
father
and
mother
were
owned
by
robert
love
an
extensive
planter
and
the
owner
of
many
slaves
he
was
in
his
way
and
in
comparison
with
many
other
slave
owners
of
those
days
a
kind
and
indulgent
master
my
father
was
a
sort
of
foreman
of
the
slaves
on
the
plantation
and
my
mother
presided
over
the
kitchen
at
the
big
house
and
my
master
table
and
among
her
other
duties
were
to
milk
the
cows
and
run
the
loom
weaving
clothing
for
the
other
slaves
this
left
her
scant
time
to
look
after
me
so
i
early
acquired
the
habit
of
looking
out
for
myself
the
other
members
of
father
family
were
my
sister
sally
about
eight
years
old
and
my
brother
jordan
about
five
my
sister
sally
was
supposed
to
look
after
me
when
my
mother
was
otherwise
occupied
but
between
my
sister
duties
of
helping
mother
and
chasing
the
flies
from
table
i
received
very
little
looking
after
from
any
of
the
family
therefore
necessity
compelled
me
at
an
early
age
to
look
after
myself
and
rustle
my
own
grub
my
earliest
recollections
are
of
pushing
a
chair
in
front
of
me
and
toddling
from
one
to
the
other
of
my
master
family
to
get
a
mouthful
to
eat
like
a
pet
dog
and
later
on
as
i
became
older
making
raids
on
the
garden
to
satisfy
my
hunger
much
to
the
damage
of
the
young
onions
watermelons
turnips
sweet
potatoes
and
other
things
i
could
find
to
eat
we
had
to
use
much
caution
during
these
raids
on
the
garden
because
we
well
knew
what
we
would
catch
if
someone
caught
us
but
much
practice
made
us
experts
in
escaping
undetected
illustration
my
old
plantation
home
one
day
when
master
and
the
family
went
to
town
mother
decided
to
make
some
wine
of
which
she
was
very
fond
accordingly
she
gathered
some
grapes
and
after
pressing
them
she
made
some
fairly
good
wine
this
she
placed
in
a
demijohn
and
this
for
better
security
she
hid
in
the
garden
as
she
thought
unknown
to
anyone
but
my
brother
sister
and
myself
had
been
watching
the
process
with
considerable
curiosity
which
finally
reached
such
a
pitch
that
there
was
nothing
to
it
we
must
sample
a
liquid
that
looked
so
good
so
jordan
went
to
the
hay
loft
from
where
a
good
view
could
be
obtained
all
around
while
myself
and
sally
busied
ourselves
in
the
vineyard
presently
mother
thinking
all
secure
left
the
house
with
the
demijohn
and
proceeded
to
hide
it
jordan
from
the
hay
loft
noted
that
mother
never
left
the
garden
until
she
returned
to
the
house
empty
handed
but
he
was
unable
to
see
the
exact
hiding
place
it
was
several
days
later
while
passing
through
the
garden
that
we
ran
across
the
lost
demijohn
it
did
not
take
us
long
to
discover
that
its
contents
suited
our
tastes
sally
and
jordan
dragged
it
into
a
sweet
corn
patch
where
we
were
safe
from
observation
an
oyster
can
was
secured
to
serve
as
a
glass
and
the
way
we
attacked
that
wine
was
a
caution
to
the
temperance
workers
and
i
can
assure
you
we
enjoyed
ourselves
for
a
while
but
for
how
long
i
am
unable
to
tell
exactly
mother
soon
missed
us
but
being
very
busy
she
could
not
look
for
us
until
evening
when
she
started
out
to
look
us
up
after
searching
and
calling
in
vain
she
decided
to
take
the
dogs
to
help
find
us
with
their
aid
we
were
soon
located
lying
in
the
sweet
corn
dead
drunk
while
the
demijohn
quite
empty
bottom
side
up
stared
at
mother
with
a
reproachful
stare
and
the
oyster
can
which
had
served
up
and
took
me
to
the
house
and
let
sally
and
jordan
lie
in
near
by
bearing
mute
witness
against
us
mother
picked
me
up
and
took
me
to
the
house
and
let
sally
and
jordan
lie
in
the
sweet
corn
all
night
to
dwell
on
the
events
immediately
preceding
our
return
to
consciousness
is
a
painful
subject
to
me
as
it
was
exceedingly
painful
then
i
was
most
feverish
the
next
day
with
a
head
on
my
shoulders
several
sizes
larger
than
the
one
i
was
used
to
wearing
sally
and
jordan
were
enjoying
about
the
same
health
as
myself
but
the
state
of
our
health
did
not
exempt
us
from
wrath
we
all
received
a
good
sound
thrashing
a
fitting
prelude
to
my
first
drunk
illustration
mother
ran
the
loom
i
suppose
i
acquired
the
taste
for
strong
drink
on
this
occasion
be
that
as
it
may
the
fact
remains
that
i
could
any
man
i
ever
met
in
the
cattle
country
i
could
drink
large
quantities
of
the
fiery
stuff
they
called
whiskey
on
the
range
without
it
affecting
me
in
any
way
but
i
have
never
been
downright
drunk
since
that
time
in
the
sweet
corn
patch
our
plantation
was
situated
in
the
heart
of
the
black
belt
of
the
south
and
on
the
plantations
all
around
us
were
thousands
of
slaves
all
engaged
in
garnering
the
dollars
that
kept
up
the
aristocracy
of
the
south
and
many
of
the
proud
old
families
owe
their
standing
and
wealth
to
the
toil
and
sweat
of
the
black
man
brow
where
if
they
had
to
pay
the
regular
rate
of
wages
to
hire
laborers
to
cultivate
their
large
estates
their
wealth
would
not
have
amounted
to
a
third
of
what
it
was
wealth
was
created
commerce
carried
on
cities
built
and
the
new
world
well
started
on
the
career
that
has
led
to
its
present
greatness
and
standing
in
the
world
of
nations
all
this
was
accomplished
by
the
sweat
of
the
black
man
brow
by
black
man
i
do
not
mean
to
say
only
the
black
men
but
the
black
woman
and
black
child
all
helped
to
make
the
proud
south
what
it
was
the
boast
of
every
white
man
and
woman
with
a
drop
of
southern
blood
in
their
veins
and
what
did
the
black
man
get
in
return
his
keep
and
care
you
say
ye
gods
and
little
fishes
is
there
a
man
living
today
who
would
be
willing
to
do
the
work
performed
by
the
slaves
of
that
time
for
the
same
returns
his
care
and
keep
no
my
friends
we
did
it
because
we
were
forced
to
do
it
by
the
dominant
race
we
had
as
task
masters
in
many
instances
perfect
devils
in
human
form
men
who
delighted
in
torturing
the
black
human
beings
over
whom
chance
and
the
accident
of
birth
had
placed
them
i
have
seen
men
beaten
to
the
ground
with
the
butts
of
the
long
whips
carried
by
these
brutal
overseers
and
for
no
other
reason
than
that
they
could
not
raise
to
their
shoulders
a
load
sufficient
for
four
men
to
carry
i
have
seen
the
long
cruel
lash
curl
around
the
shoulders
of
women
who
refused
to
comply
with
the
licentious
wishes
of
the
men
who
owned
them
body
and
soul
did
i
say
soul
no
they
did
not
own
their
soul
that
belonged
to
god
alone
and
many
are
the
souls
that
have
returned
to
him
who
gave
them
rather
than
submit
to
the
desires
of
their
masters
desires
to
which
submission
was
worse
than
death
i
have
seen
the
lash
draw
blood
from
the
tender
limbs
of
mere
babies
hardly
more
than
able
to
toddle
their
only
offense
being
that
their
skin
was
black
and
young
as
i
was
my
blood
often
boiled
as
i
witnessed
these
cruel
sights
knowing
that
they
were
allowed
by
the
laws
of
the
land
in
which
i
was
born
i
used
to
think
it
was
not
the
country
fault
but
the
fault
of
the
men
who
made
the
laws
of
all
the
curses
of
this
fair
land
the
greatest
curse
of
all
was
the
slave
auction
block
of
the
south
where
human
flesh
was
bought
and
sold
husbands
were
torn
from
their
wives
the
baby
from
its
mother
breast
and
the
most
sacred
commands
of
god
were
violated
under
the
guise
of
modern
law
or
the
law
of
the
land
which
for
more
than
two
hundred
years
has
boasted
of
its
freedom
and
the
freedom
of
its
people
illustration
my
first
drunk
some
of
the
slaves
like
us
had
kind
and
indulgent
masters
these
were
lucky
indeed
as
their
lot
was
somewhat
improved
over
their
less
fortunate
brothers
but
even
their
lot
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
horse
or
cow
of
the
present
day
they
were
never
allowed
to
get
anything
in
the
nature
of
education
as
smart
negroes
were
not
in
much
demand
at
that
time
and
the
reason
was
too
apparent
education
meant
the
death
of
the
institution
of
slavery
in
this
country
and
so
the
slave
owners
took
good
care
that
their
slaves
got
none
of
it
go
and
see
the
play
of
uncle
tom
cabin
and

chapter
ii
war
the
rebels
and
yankees
i
raise
a
regiment
to
fight
difficulty
in
finding
an
enemy
ash
sake
freedom
when
i
was
ten
years
old
the
war
broke
out
between
the
north
and
the
south
and
there
was
little
else
talked
about
among
the
slaves
as
well
as
the
slave
owners
of
the
neighborhood
and
naturally
the
many
different
stories
we
heard
worked
us
children
to
a
high
state
of
excitement
so
much
so
that
we
wanted
to
go
to
war
and
fight
for
the
union
because
among
us
slave
children
there
was
no
difference
of
opinion
as
to
which
side
was
right
the
union
was
it
and
we
were
all
yankees
not
being
able
to
go
to
war
as
our
masters
did
we
concluded
to
play
war
accordingly
i
gathered
all
the
boys
of
the
neighborhood
together
into
a
regiment
which
it
was
my
intention
to
divide
into
two
parties
of
rebels
and
yankees
but
in
this
i
met
an
insurmountable
obstacle
not
one
of
the
boys
wanted
to
be
a
rebel
consequently
we
had
to
look
elsewhere
for
an
enemy
to
give
us
battle
and
serve
as
a
vent
for
our
growing
enthusiasm
the
next
sunday
preceding
the
organization
of
our
regiment
we
started
out
over
the
surrounding
country
in
quest
of
trouble
which
we
were
not
long
in
finding
as
we
soon
ran
across
a
nest
of
yellow
jackets
these
we
proceeded
to
exterminate
in
which
we
were
successful
after
a
short
but
destructive
battle
we
suffered
considerably
in
wounded
but
lost
none
of
our
soldiers
this
engagement
we
called
the
capture
of
fort
hell
for
some
time
thereafter
we
made
regular
raids
into
the
surrounding
country
in
quest
of
an
enemy
we
were
eventually
successful
in
our
quest
as
in
quick
order
we
ran
across
and
captured
a
company
of
bumble
bees
this
we
called
the
battle
of
the
wilderness
victory
over
a
nest
of
hornets
we
called
the
capture
of
fort
sumter
a
large
nest
of
wasps
gave
us
perhaps
the
hardest
fight
of
our
campaigning
this
we
ran
across
in
the
fields
not
far
from
home
there
was
an
unusually
large
number
of
them
and
as
is
usually
the
case
with
these
insects
they
proved
very
ferocious
nothing
loth
however
we
attacked
with
cheers
only
to
be
driven
back
time
and
again
and
finally
we
were
compelled
to
make
a
very
undignified
retreat
at
full
speed
in
the
direction
of
home
not
to
be
beaten
however
we
secured
reinforcements
and
more
ammunition
in
the
shape
of
old
rags
brooms
and
so
forth
and
returned
to
the
charge
and
although
we
were
driven
back
several
times
we
stayed
until
we
won
out
and
the
last
insect
lay
a
quivering
mass
on
the
ground
there
was
not
one
among
us
not
wounded
in
some
manner
as
for
myself
i
had
enough
of
it
my
nose
looked
like
a
dutch
slipper
and
it
was
several
days
before
my
eyes
were
able
to
perform
the
duties
for
which
they
were
made
however
the
union
forces
were
victorious
and
we
were
happy
our
masters
told
us
if
the
soldiers
caught
us
they
would
hang
us
all
which
had
the
effect
of
keeping
most
of
us
close
around
home
master
had
gone
to
join
lee
forces
taking
with
him
father
who
was
engaged
in
building
forts
which
work
kept
him
with
the
confederate
army
until
general
grant
arrived
in
the
country
when
he
was
allowed
to
come
home
from
then
on
union
soldiers
passed
the
neighborhood
most
every
day
on
their
way
south
to
join
the
fighting
regiments
we
soon
found
out
they
would
not
hurt
us
and
they
were
the
wonderment
and
pride
of
our
youthful
minds
they
would
take
everything
they
could
find
to
eat
for
themselves
and
horses
leaving
the
plantation
stripped
clean
of
provisions
and
food
which
entailed
considerable
misery
and
hardships
on
those
left
at
home
especially
the
colored
people
who
were
not
used
to
such
a
state
of
affairs
and
were
not
accustomed
to
providing
for
their
own
wants
finally
lee
surrendered
and
master
returned
home
but
in
common
with
other
masters
of
those
days
he
did
not
tell
us
we
were
free
and
instead
of
letting
us
go
he
made
us
work
for
him
the
same
as
before
but
in
all
other
respects
he
was
kind
he
moved
our
log
cabin
on
a
piece
of
ground
on
a
hill
owned
by
him
and
in
most
respects
things
went
on
the
same
as
before
the
war
it
was
quite
a
while
after
this
that
we
found
out
we
were
free
and
good
news
like
bad
news
sometimes
travels
fast
it
was
not
long
before
all
the
slaves
in
the
surrounding
country
were
celebrating
their
freedom
and
massa
lincoln
was
the
hero
of
us
all
illustration
mother
making
ashcake
while
a
great
many
slaves
rejoiced
at
the
altered
state
of
affairs
still
many
were
content
to
remain
as
before
and
work
for
their
old
masters
in
return
for
their
keep
my
father
however
decided
to
start
out
for
himself
to
that
end
he
rented
twenty
acres
of
land
including
that
on
which
our
cabin
stood
from
our
late
master
we
were
at
this
time
in
a
most
destitute
condition
and
father
had
a
very
hard
time
to
get
a
start
without
food
or
money
and
almost
naked
we
existed
for
a
time
on
the
only
food
procurable
bran
and
cracklins
the
limited
supply
of
provisions
made
the
culinary
duties
most
simple
much
to
the
disgust
of
mother
who
was
one
of
the
best
cooks
in
the
country
but
beggars
can
not
be
choosers
and
she
very
cheerfully
proceeded
to
make
the
best
of
what
we
had
she
would
make
a
great
fire
in
the
large
fire
place
in
the
cabin
the
fire
when
hot
enough
was
raked
from
the
hearth
and
a
small
place
cleaned
away
in
the
center
of
this
clean
space
mother
would
lay
a
cabbage
leaf
on
which
she
would
pour
some
batter
made
from
bran
and
water
or
buttermilk
and
a
little
salt
then
on
top
another
cabbage
leaf
was
laid
and
hot
coals
raked
over
the
whole
and
in
a
short
time
it
would
be
baked
nicely
this
we
called
ash
cake
this
with
occasional
cracklins
made
up
our
entire
bill
of
fare
for
many
months
father
would
make
brooms
and
mats
from
straw
and
chair
bottoms
from
cane
and
reeds
in
which
my
brother
and
i
would
help
him
after
he
had
taught
us
how
during
the
week
a
large
load
was
made
and
friday
night
father
would
take
the
load
on
his
shoulders
and
walk
to
town
a
dozen
miles
where
he
would
sell
them
and
bring
seed
and
food
home
when
the
weather
would
permit
we
worked
in
the
field
preparing
for
our
first
crop
the
twenty
acres
being
mostly
uncultivated
had
to
be
cleared
plowed
and
thoroughly
harrowed
our
first
crop
consisted
of
corn
tobacco
and
a
few
vegetables
father
would
lay
off
the
corn
rows
jordan
and
i
would
drop
the
corn
while
father
came
behind
and
covered
the
rows
in
this
manner
we
soon
had
in
a
considerable
crop
of
corn
and
some
vegetables
for
our
own
use
during
the
winter
which
was
sometimes
severe
during
which
time
nothing
of
course
could
be
done
in
the
farming
line
and
when
not
otherwise
engaged
we
started
to
try
and
learn
ourselves
something
in
the
educational
line
father
could
read
a
little
and
he
helped
us
all
with
our
a
b
c
but
it
is
hard
work
learning
to
read
and
write
without
a
teacher
and
there
was
no
school
a
black
child
could
attend
at
that
time
however
we
managed
to
make
some
headway
then
spring
came
and
with
it
the
routine
of
farm
work
father
was
a
man
of
strong
determination
not
easily
discouraged
and
always
pushing
forward
and
upward
quick
to
learn
things
and
slow
to
forget
them
a
keen
observer
and
a
loving
husband
and
father
had
he
lived
this
history
would
not
have
been
written
chapter
iii
raising

our
first
year
of
freedom
more
privations
father
dies
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
i
become
the
head
of
the
family
and
start
to
work
at
per
month
as
soon
as
the
corn
crop
was
in
the
ground
we
commenced
to
plant
tobacco
before
the
seed
was
sown
it
was
necessary
to
gather
large
piles
of
brush
and
wood
and
burn
it
to
ashes
on
the
ground
to
destroy
the
seeds
of
the
weeds
the
ground
was
then
spaded
and
raked
thoroughly
and
the
seed
sown
after
it
had
come
up
and
got
a
fair
start
it
was
transplanted
in
rows
about
three
feet
apart
when
the
plants
become
large
enough
it
is
necessary
to
pull
the
suckers
off
also
the
worms
off
the
leaves
this
task
fell
upon
jordan
and
myself
in
picking
the
worms
off
the
plants
it
is
necessary
to
use
the
greatest
care
that
the
plants
are
not
damaged
but
jordan
and
i
were
afraid
to
touch
the
worms
with
our
fingers
so
we
took
sticks
and
knocked
them
off
also
a
few
leaves
with
each
worm
this
fact
called
forth
some
rather
strong
language
from
father
who
said
we
were
doing
more
harm
than
good
but
our
aversion
to
the
worms
was
so
strong
that
we
took
several
thrashings
before
we
could
bring
ourselves
to
use
our
fingers
instead
of
a
stick
when
the
tobacco
was
ripe
there
would
be
yellow
spots
on
the
leaves
it
was
then
cut
let
lie
for
one
day
then
hung
on
a
scaffold
to
be
sun
cured
it
was
allowed
to
remain
on
the
scaffold
for
perhaps
a
week
then
it
was
hung
up
in
the
barn
to
be
smoked
after
which
it
was
made
into
a
big
bulk
and
a
weight
placed
on
it
to
press
it
out
then
it
was
stripped
and
put
into
hands
and
then
it
was
ready
for
the
market
our
crop
the
first
year
was
not
large
and
the
most
of
it
went
to
pay
the
rent
and
the
following
winter
proved
a
hard
one
and
entailed
considerable
privation
and
suffering
among
the
many
who
had
so
recently
been
thrown
on
their
own
resources
without
money
or
clothing
or
food
and
only
those
who
have
had
the
experience
can
appreciate
the
condition
of
things
or
rather
lack
of
things
at
the
close
of
the
war
and
these
conditions
did
not
only
affect
the
and
colored
people
but
covered
the
entire
south
and
many
former
slave
owners
now
found
themselves
without
a
penny
they
could
call
their
own
having
been
stripped
of
everything
and
compelled
to
start
all
over
again
surely
war
is
hell
but
slavery
is
worse
early
in
the
spring
father
went
to
work
for
a
neighboring
planter
a
couple
of
weeks
in
order
to
get
his
plows
and
horses
again
to
plow
his
land
a
somewhat
larger
crop
was
put
in
this
year
but
unfortunately
for
us
when
everything
was
planted
father
took
sick
and
died
shortly
after
this
was
a
stunning
loss
to
us
just
at
a
time
when
we
most
needed
a
father
and
husband
help
counsel
and
protection
but
we
did
not
lose
courage
for
long
illustration
raising
tobacco
the
crop
must
be
looked
after
and
the
coming
winter
provided
against
my
sister
sally
had
been
married
about
three
years
at
this
time
and
was
with
her
husband
and
two
little
girls
on
a
small
farm
some
distance
away
which
my
rented
that
left
mother
jordan
and
i
to
look
after
things
although
i
was
the
youngest
i
was
the
most
courageous
always
leading
in
mischief
play
and
work
so
i
now
took
the
leadership
and
became
the
head
of
the
family
things
were
beginning
to
take
on
a
more
hopeful
look
when
my
died
leaving
my
sister
sick
with
two
small
children
and
in
about
the
same
circumstances
as
ourselves
everything
indeed
looked
hopeless
now
as
our
late
master
and
his
brother
had
left
the
old
place
and
gone
north
so
remembering
i
was
the
only
man
on
the
place
now
though
only
fifteen
years
old
i
said
to
mother
and
sister
who
were
weeping
bitterly
brace
up
and
do
lose
your
heads
i
will
look
after
you
all
i
said
this
with
a
bravado
i
was
far
from
feeling
but
i
could
not
see
the
use
of
weeping
now
there
was
work
to
be
done
if
we
were
to
keep
from
starving
the
coming
winter
we
all
turned
in
to
help
one
another
and
in
this
manner
the
crop
was
gathered
and
we
were
in
fairly
good
condition
for
the
coming
winter
but
the
work
was
too
much
for
sally
who
lingered
through
the
winter
and
early
in
the
spring
we
laid
her
beside
her
father
and
husband
and
her
two
little
orphans
were
left
to
us
it
now
became
very
apparent
to
me
that
something
must
be
done
because
the
crop
raised
the
year
before
was
barely
enough
to
last
us
through
the
winter
and
we
would
soon
be
in
actual
need
again
we
needed
clothing
especially
the
little
girls
of
my
sister
and
we
had
no
money
to
buy
seed
for
this
season
crop
or
food
to
last
us
out
so
i
concluded
to
go
to
work
for
some
one
if
i
could
find
anything
to
do
with
that
resolve
i
put
on
my
best
rags
and
to
mother
inquiry
as
to
where
i
was
going
i
told
her
i
did
not
know
myself
it
fairly
made
my
heart
ache
to
see
my
little
nieces
going
around
almost
naked
bare
footed
and
have
them
always
asking
for
things
i
was
powerless
to
give
them
i
determined
to
go
from
place
to
place
until
i
secured
employment
of
some
kind
that
would
in
a
measure
permit
me
to
feed
and
as
far
as
i
was
able
clothe
mother
and
the
children
now
dependent
on
me
illustration
raising
tobacco
we
knock
the
worms
off
the
fact
that
i
was
now
free
gave
me
new
born
courage
to
face
the
world
and
what
the
future
might
hold
in
store
for
me
after
tramping
around
the
country
for
two
days
i
finally
secured
work
with
a
brooks
about
six
miles
from
home
at
one
dollar
and
fifty
cents
a
month
notwithstanding
the
smallness
of
my
prospective
wages
i
was
happy
and
returned
home
in
a
jubilant
frame
of
mind
to
impart
the
news
to
mother
i
was
to
commence
the
next
morning
mother
said
it
was
not
much
but
better
than
nothing
i
told
mother
that
i
thought
i
could
bring
some
food
and
clothing
home
for
the
children
before
the
month
was
out
the
little
ones
hearing
this
were
overjoyed
and
looked
on
me
as
a
rich
man
indeed
jordan
was
to
remain
at
home
and
attend
to
what
little
there
was
to
do
and
the
next
day
i
started
work
for
brooks
in
less
than
a
week
i
made
my
first
visit
home
taking
with
me
some
potatoes
bacon
cornmeal
and
some
molasses
which
i
had
rustled
in
various
ways
i
also
had
a
bundle
of
old
clothing
given
to
me
by
the
neighbors
which
mother
could
make
over
for
the
children
and
to
say
the
children
were
happy
is
but
a
mild
expression
for
the
second
month
i
received
a
raise
of
fifty
cents
and
the
third
month
of
my
employment
so
good
did
i
work
that
i
received
three
dollars
with
so
many
at
home
to
provide
for
my
wages
did
not
last
long
but
out
of
my
three
dollars
i
bought
each
of
the
children
a
book
the
rest
went
for
provisions
and
clothing
one
day
while
passing
the
store
of
graves
near
our
home
i
saw
a
checked
sunbonnet
and
a
red
calico
dress
which
struck
my
fancy
as
just
what
i
wanted
for
mother
on
asking
the
price
graves
told
me
i
could
have
the
sunbonnet
for
cents
and
the
dress
for
four
bits
that
seemed
to
be
within
my
means
and
quite
reasonable
i
asked
him
to
keep
them
for
me
until
i
got
my
wages
at
the
end
of
the
month
this
graves
promised
to
do
if
i
would
pay
him
something
down
i
only
had
fifteen
cents
of
which
i
paid
five
cents
on
the
bonnet
and
ten
cents
on
the
dress
and
went
on
my
way
filled
with
happy
thoughts
as
the
result
of
my
bargain
i
resolved
to
be
very
saving
this
month
and
i
became
very
impatient
for
my
month
to
end
and
was
continually
asking
brooks
if
my
month
was
not
soon
over
he
would
laugh
and
say
yes
soon
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
was
the
longest
month
i
ever
knew
when
at
last
the
month
was
over
he
gave
me
fifty
cents
claiming
i
had
drawn
my
wages
during
the
month
i
knew
that
was
not
so
i
also
knew
i
had
a
balance
coming
to
me
and
told
him
so
but
he
denied
it
and
the
result
was
that
we
had
a
fight
i
hit
him
in
the
head
with
a
rock
and
nearly
killed
him
after
which
i
felt
better
then
going
to
graves
the
storekeeper
i
told
him
the
whole
trouble
he
expressed
sympathy
for
me
and
said
to
give
him
the
fifty
cents
and
take
the
bonnet
and
dress
and
we
will
call
it
square
and
you
can
imagine
my
feelings
as
i
took
the
things
home
to
mother
and
she
was
more
pleased
with
them
than
any
queen
with
her
silks
and
satins
there
being
plenty
of
work
to
do
at
home
i
did
not
again
look
for
other
work
the
only
thing
that
worried
me
was
that
the
little
ones
were
still
without
shoes
but
on
my
promise
to
soon
get
them
some
they
were
satisfied
it
was
here
i
got
my
first
lessons
in
and
life
struggles
i
learned
true
usefulness
and
acquired
the
habit
of
helping
others
which
i
carried
with
me
all
through
my
after
life
and
that
trait
perhaps
more
than
any
other
endeared
me
to
my
companions
on
the
range
and
all
with
whom
i
have
had
dealings

my

experience
in
rough
riding
a
question
of
breaking
the
horse
or
breaking
my
neck
in
those
days
it
was
more
the
custom
than
now
to
work
six
days
and
rest
on
the
seventh
accordingly
us
boys
always
had
our
sundays
free
and
we
never
lost
an
opportunity
to
put
in
motion
some
devilment
to
make
the
time
pass
in
what
we
thought
was
the
most
pleasant
way
anything
to
have
a
great
time
our
chief
means
of
having
fun
for
a
while
was
the
rock
battles
we
boys
of
the
entire
neighborhood
would
get
together
then
divide
in
equal
numbers
on
a
side
then
after
gathering
all
the
available
rocks
from
the
landscape
we
would
proceed
to
have
a
pitched
battle
throwing
the
rocks
at
each
other
as
hard
as
we
could
and
with
a
grim
intent
to
commit
battery
as
a
rational
consequence
the
bravest
would
force
the
weaker
side
to
retreat
it
then
became
a
question
of
running
or
being
rocked
to
death
after
these
battles
we
were
all
usually
in
very
bad
condition
having
received
very
hard
knocks
on
sundry
and
various
parts
of
our
anatomy
but
for
all
that
we
have
never
bore
malice
toward
each
other
we
were
careful
to
keep
these
escapades
from
the
knowledge
of
our
elders
in
this
way
we
were
quite
successful
until
one
time
we
had
a
boy
nearly
killed
then
we
thought
the
old
folks
would
whip
us
all
to
death
this
incident
ended
the
rock
battles
but
we
soon
had
something
else
doing
to
furnish
ourselves
fun
and
excitement

in
my

about
this
time
we
planned
a
rabbit
hunt
after
the
small
cotton
tail
rabbits
which
were
plentiful
in
the
surrounding
country
getting
all
the
boys
together
and
securing
the
track
hounds
of
the
neighborhood
we
were
off
it
was
not
long
before
the
dogs
caught
track
of
something
and
away
they
went
with
all
the
boys
behind
now
at
that
time
it
was
not
customary
for
us
boys
of
the
plantation
to
wear
shoes
and
pants
the
principal
reason
being
that
we
did
not
have
either
shoes
or
pants
to
wear
so
you
can
perhaps
imagine
the
sight
presented
by
a
score
or
more
of
boys
of
all
ages
chasing
behind
the
hounds
with
our
shirt
tails
flying
through
bushes
thorns
and
brambles
up
hill
and
down
hill
many
of
us
bleeding
like
stabbed
pigs
but
we
were
too
much
interested
to
pay
any
attention
to
a
little
blood
we
wanted
the
rabbits
and
everything
else
was
of
secondary
importance
even
the
calls
of
the
younger
boys
who
got
tired
and
fell
behind
onward
we
went
over
rocks
through
fields
over
fences
until
we
could
hear
the
dogs
no
more
then
tired
out
we
had
to
stop
i
told
the
boys
to
sit
down
that
i
thought
the
dogs
would
come
this
way
again
it
was
not
long
before
i
thought
i
heard
something
and
told
the
boys
to
hush
and
have
their
rocks
ready
to
kill
the
rabbit
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
be
anything
but
a
rabbit
the
bay
of
the
dogs
came
nearer
then
over
the
fence
jumped
a
big
red
fox
right
in
front
of
me
he
stopped
and
we
looked
in
each
others
eyes
it
was
hard
to
tell
which
of
us
was
the
most
surprised
however
i
was
the
first
to
run
away
and
run
i
did
i
ran
like
a
black
tailed
deer
many
times
i
thought
i
felt
him
nibble
at
my
shirt
tails
and
his
eyes
grew
in
my
imagination
as
large
as
wagon
wheels
and
fox
himself
seemed
to
grow
as
big
as
an
elephant
when
at
last
i
dropped
from
sheer
exhaustion
and
could
summon
courage
to
look
behind
me
i
could
see
nothing
it
was
then
i
realized
i
was
not
so
game
as
i
thought
i
was
and
the
knowledge
was
not
pleasant
by
any
means
not
far
from
our
house
there
was
a
horse
ranch
owned
by
a
williams
he
had
two
sons
about
my
own
age
and
i
would
often
go
and
see
them
on
sundays
as
i
was
very
fond
of
riding
horses
most
of
the
horses
on
the
ranch
were
very
wild
so
one
day
the
oldest
boy
and
i
made
a
plan
to
break
the
young
colts
the
only
chance
we
had
of
doing
so
was
on
sunday
when
the
family
went
to
church
as
we
did
not
think
williams
would
approve
of
our
plan
williams
boy
said
he
would
give
me
ten
cents
for
every
colt
i
broke
that
was
perfectly
satisfactory
to
me
the
money
was
made
of
shin
plaster
those
days
paper
the
next
sunday
i
started
to
break
horses
we
did
not
dare
to
put
the
bridle
on
them
as
we
were
afraid
the
boss
might
surprise
us
and
we
would
not
be
quick
enough
to
get
it
off
our
mode
of
procedure
was
to
drive
one
at
a
time
in
the
barn
get
it
in
a
stall
then
after
much
difficulty
i
would
manage
to
get
on
its
back
then
the
door
was
opened
and
the
pole
removed
and
the
horse
liberated
with
me
on
its
back
then
the
fun
would
commence
the
colt
would
run
jump
kick
and
pitch
around
the
barn
yard
in
his
efforts
to
throw
me
off
but
he
might
as
well
tried
to
jump
out
of
his
skin
because
i
held
on
to
his
mane
and
stuck
to
him
like
a
leech
the
colt
would
usually
keep
up
his
bucking
until
he
could
buck
no
more
and
then
i
would
get
my
ten
cents
ten
cents
is
a
small
amount
of
money
these
days
but
in
those
days
that
amount
was
worth
more
to
me
than
ten
dollars
now
illustration
a
case
of
breaking
the
horse
or
breaking
my
neck
well
we
went
on
sunday
after
sunday
and
i
broke
about
a
dozen
colts
in
this
way
and
also
managed
to
do
it
without
the
boss
discovering
the
favor
i
was
undoubtedly
doing
him
in
breaking
all
his
wild
horses
only
his
boys
were
aware
of
the
doings
and
they
paid
me
so
i
had
no
scruples
about
what
i
was
doing
especially
as
it
afforded
me
great
fun
finally
the
boys
wanted
me
to
break
a
big
handsome
black
horse
called
black
highwayman
knowing
the
horse
uncertain
temper
and
wild
disposition
and
taking
into
consideration
its
size
i
refused
to
break
him
for
ten
cents
as
the
fact
was
i
was
rather
scared
of
him
after
considerable
bargaining
in
which
i
held
out
for
fifty
cents
we
finally
compromised
on
cents
but
i
can
assure
you
it
was
more
for
the
money
than
the
fun
of
the
thing
that
i
finally
consented
to
ride
him
with
great
difficulty
we
managed
to
get
him
in
a
stall
as
we
did
the
others
but
i
no
sooner
landed
on
his
back
than
he
jumped
in
the
manger
with
me
hanging
to
his
mane
finally
the
door
was
opened
and
the
pole
removed
and
out
of
the
barn
we
shot
like
a
black
cloud
around
the
yard
we
flew
then
over
the
garden
fence
at
this
juncture
the
track
hounds
became
interested
and
promptly
followed
us
over
the
fields
we
went
the
horse
clearing
the
highest
fences
and
other
obstacles
in
his
way
with
the
greatest
ease
my
seat
on
his
back
was
not
the
most
comfortable
place
in
the
world
but
as
the
horse
did
not
evince
any
disposition
to
stop
and
let
me
get
off
i
concluded
to
remain
where
i
was
all
the
dogs
of
the
neighborhood
were
fast
joining
in
the
race
and
i
had
quite
a
respectable
following
after
running
about
two
miles
we
cleared
a
fence
into
a
pasture
where
there
was
a
large
number
of
other
horses
and
young
colts
who
promptly
stampeded
as
we
joined
them
highwayman
taking
the
lead
with
me
on
his
back
looking
very
much
like
a
toad
and
all
the
dogs
in
the
country
strung
out
in
the
rear
naturally
we
formed
a
spectacle
that
could
not
fail
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
neighbors
who
soon
as
possible
mounted
horses
and
started
in
pursuit
and
vainly
tried
to
catch
my
black
mount
but
could
get
nowhere
near
him
while
i
without
bridle
or
anything
to
control
him
could
do
nothing
but
let
him
run
as
all
the
other
horses
bunched
around
us
and
the
dogs
kept
up
a
continual
din
i
simply
held
on
and
let
him
go
it
was
a
question
of
breaking
the
horse
or
breaking
my
neck
we
went
over
everything
through
everything
until
finally
the
killing
pace
told
and
black
highwayman
fell
a
thoroughly
exhausted
and
completely
conquered
and
well
broken
horse
as
for
myself
i
was
none
the
worse
for
my
exciting
ride
but
on
looking
for
my
cents
i
found
it
gone
the
boys
had
paid
me
in
advance
as
i
insisted
and
i
had
tied
the
money
up
in
a
corner
of
my
shirt
tail
and
during
my
wild
ride
it
had
come
untied
and
worked
out
this
was
a
great
misfortune
to
me
and
for
a
while
i
was
inconsolable
i
asked
the
boys
if
they
would
make
it
right
but
no
they
had
paid
me
once
and
they
refused
to
give
me
another
quarter
this
riled
me
considerable
and
i
told
them
all
right
to
come
again
when
they
wanted
a
horse
broken
that
settled
us
and
the
horse
breaking
the
experiences
i
gained
in
riding

these
times

stead

course
heard
of
my

instead
of
being
angry
he
seemed
to
see
the
funny
side
of
it

i
could
not

spectators
wondered
how
in

years

now

work

the

making

the
crop
was
all
in
and
after

to
such
work
around

as
had

we
found
a
source
of
revenue
in
gathering
berries
for
market
large
quantities
of
black
berries
and
others
grew
wild
in
the
woods
near
by
and
they
always
found
a
ready
market
with
small
pails
and
a
big
basket

and
i
would
start
out
after
the
work
at
home
was
done

we
would
sit
under
the
bushes
and
fill
the
pails
then
empty
them
into
the
big
basket
until
that
was
full
which
usually
comprised
our
day
work
one
day
wishing
to
secure
a
large
quantity
of
berries
for
market
we
went
early
in
the
morning
and
on
reaching
the
woods
we
placed
the
big
basket
in
what
we
thought
a
safe
place
and
after
some
hours
of
industrious
work
the
big
basket
was
full
of
nice
ripe
blackberries
we
then
proceeded
to
fill
our
pails
again
which
would
be
sufficient
for
the
day
this
accomplished
we
prepared
to
start
for
home
but
when
mother
went
to
take
the
big
basket
it
was
empty
the
stray
pigs
had
found
them
and
committed

felt

in

it
had

take
them

something
for

but
now
the
fruit
of
our
labor
was
gone
and
the
disappointment
was
great
i
looked
at
mother
then
at
the
empty
basket
and
did
not
know
for
which
to
feel
most

i
said

there
is

we

we
could
not
have
lost
them

of

kind
for

mother
turned
toward
me
and
said
with
a
look
i
will
always
remember
my
boy
whatever
happens
you
never
get
discouraged
i
did
not
see
the
use
of
losing
courage
and
i
think
the

time
i
weakened
was
when

died

could
not

lucky
day
and
sold
our
stock
of
berries

in

short
time
we
then
bought
what
we
needed
and
had

money
left

for
all
that
i
was
not
quite
satisfied
i
wanted

to
buy

was
not

if
we
do
save
a

cents
now
what
will
it
be
later
on
we
will
have
to
go
to
the
poorhouse
i
said
dear
mother
if
there
is
a
house
poorer
than
ours
i
do
want
to
see
it
i
will
always
remember
the
sight
of
mother
face
as
she
turned
to
me
the
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
as
she
answered
yes
my
son
you
are
right
there
are
few
houses
poorer
than
ours
now
the
same
year
when
fall
came
mother
and
i
thought
we
had
the
bull
by
the
horns
there
were
several
fine
groves
of
walnut
hickory
nut
chestnut
and
shirly
bark
nut
trees
in
the
woods
and
i
made
a
sleigh
on
which
i
nailed
a
big
box
i
tied
a
rope
for
a
tongue
and
with
a
stick
on
the
end
mother
and
i
working
as
a
sort
of
double
team
would
draw
through
the
woods
among
the
trees
gathering
the
different
kinds
of
nuts
and
as
the
box
was
big
large
quantities
could
be
gathered
in
this
manner
during
the
nut
season
we
worked
every
day
from
morning
to
night
gathering
large
quantities
of
nuts
for
which
we
always
found
a
ready
market
as
we
worked
we
talked
of
what
we
would
buy
with
the
money
and
making
plans
for
the
future
the
nuts
we
sold
usually
brought
us
chestnuts
one
dollar
a
bushel
walnuts
fifty
cents
and
hickory
nuts
fifty
cents
a
bushel
this
money
added
to
the
proceeds
of
the
crop
netted
us
quite
a
nice
sum
and
made
our
condition
much
better
but
i
assure
you
dear
readers
it
took
hard
work
from
morning
to
night
to
make
both
ends
meet
but
with
the
help
of
god
we
made
them
meet
and
during
this
time
we
were
always
healthy
and
the
knowledge
that
we
were
free
and
working
for
ourselves
gave
us
courage
to
continue
the
struggle
it
was
about
this
time
that
i
commenced
thinking
about
going
west
illustration
we
go
to
market
illustration
i
win
a
horse
in
a
raffle
i
wanted
to
see
more
of
the
world
and
as
i
began
to
realize
there
was
so
much
more
of
the
world
than
what
i
had
seen
the
desire
to
go
grew
on
me
from
day
to
day
it
was
hard
to
think
of
leaving
mother
and
the
children
but
freedom
is
sweet
and
i
wanted
to
make
more
of
the
opportunity
and
my
life
than
i
could
see
possible
around
home
besides
i
suppose
i
was
a
little
selfish
as
mortals
are
prone
to
be
finally
the
desire
to
go
out
in
the
world
grew
so
strong
that
i
mentioned
it
to
mother
but
she
did
not
give
me
much
encouragement
and
i
do
think
she
thought
i
had
the
courage
to
go
and
besides
i
had
neither
clothing
or
money
and
to
tell
the
truth
the
outlook
was
discouraging
even
to
me
but
i
continued
to
look
for
an
opportunity
which
happened
in
a
very
unexpected
manner
shortly
after
one
day
a
man
by
the
name
of
johnson
announced
that
he
would
raffle
a
fine
beautiful
horse
at
fifty
cents
a
chance
i
heard
of
it
at
once
but
had
no
money
with
which
to
get
a
chance
however
when
there
a
will
there
a
way
so
i
went
to
the
barn
and
caught
two
chickens
which
i
sold
for
fifty
cents
and
at
once
got
a
chance
my
chance
won
the
horse
johnson
said
he
would
give
me
fifty
dollars
for
the
horse
and
as
i
needed
the
money
more
than
the
horse
i
sold
the
horse
back
johnson
at
once
raffled
him
off
again
and
again
i
won
the
horse
which
i
again
sold
for
fifty
dollars
with
nearly
a
hundred
dollars
i
went
home
and
told
mother
of
what
i
had
done
and
gave
her
half
of
the
money
telling
her
i
would
take
the
other
half
and
go
out
in
the
world
and
try
and
better
my
condition
i
then
went
to
town
and
bought
some
underwear
and
other
needful
articles
intending
to
leave
at
once
but
mother
pleaded
with
me
so
hard
to
stay
home
that
i
finally
consented
to
remain
one
more
month
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
pleaded
for
one
more
and
i
could
not
refuse
her
during
this
time
my
uncle
came
to
live
with
us
and
i
asked
him
to
take
my
place
at
home
this
he
consented
to
do
gladly
things
were
going
on
fairly
well
at
home
now
the
farm
was
yielding
a
fair
living
and
the
children
having
grown
much
larger
they
were
a
source
of
help
instead
of
an
hindrance
and
now
that
my
uncle
and
my
brother
jordan
were
home
to
look
after
mother
i
felt
i
could
better
leave
them
now
because
i
was
not
really
needed
at
home
after
gathering
what
few
things
i
wanted
to
take
with
me
and
providing
myself
with
some
needed
clothes
i
bade
mother
and
the
old
home
farewell
and
started
out
for
the
first
time
alone
in
a
world
i
knew
very
little
about
chapter
vi
the
world
is
before
me
i
join
the
texas
cowboys
red
river
dick
my
first
outfit
my
first
indian
fight
i
learn
to
use
my
gun
it
was
on
the
tenth
day
of
february
that
i
left
the
old
home
near
nashville
tennessee
i
was
at
that
time
about
fifteen
years
old
and
though
while
young
in
years
the
hard
work
and
farm
life
had
made
me
strong
and
hearty
much
beyond
my
years
and
i
had
full
confidence
in
myself
as
being
able
to
take
care
of
myself
and
making
my
way
i
at
once
struck
out
for
kansas
of
which
i
had
heard
something
and
believing
it
was
a
good
place
in
which
to
seek
employment
it
was
in
the
west
and
it
was
the
great
west
i
wanted
to
see
and
so
by
walking
and
occasional
lifts
from
farmers
going
my
way
and
taking
advantage
of
every
thing
that
promised
to
assist
me
on
my
way
i
eventually
brought
up
at
dodge
city
kansas
which
at
that
time
was
a
typical
frontier
city
with
a
great
many
saloons
dance
halls
and
gambling
houses
and
very
little
of
anything
else
when
i
arrived
the
town
was
full
of
cow
boys
from
the
surrounding
ranches
and
from
texas
and
other
parts
of
the
west
as
kansas
was
a
great
cattle
center
and
market
the
wild
cow
boy
prancing
horses
of
which
i
was
very
fond
and
the
wild
life
generally
all
had
their
attractions
for
me
and
i
decided
to
try
for
a
place
with
them
although
it
seemed
to
me
i
had
met
with
a
bad
outfit
at
least
some
of
them
going
around
among
them
i
watched
my
chances
to
get
to
speak
with
them
as
i
wanted
to
find
some
one
whom
i
thought
would
give
me
a
civil
answer
to
the
questions
i
wanted
to
ask
but
they
all
seemed
too
wild
around
town
so
the
next
day
i
went
out
where
they
were
in
camp
approaching
a
party
who
were
eating
their
breakfast
i
got
to
speak
with
them
they
asked
me
to
have
some
breakfast
with
them
which
invitation
i
gladly
accepted
during
the
meal
i
got
a
chance
to
ask
them
many
questions
they
proved
to
be
a
texas
outfit
who
had
just
come
up
with
a
herd
of
cattle
and
having
delivered
them
they
were
preparing
to
return
there
were
several
colored
cow
boys
among
them
and
good
ones
too
after
breakfast
i
asked
the
camp
boss
for
a
job
as
cow
boy
he
asked
me
if
i
could
ride
a
wild
horse
i
said
yes
sir
he
said
if
you
can
i
will
give
you
a
job
so
he
spoke
to
one
of
the
colored
cow
boys
called
bronko
jim
and
told
him
to
go
out
and
rope
old
good
eye
saddle
him
and
put
me
on
his
back
bronko
jim
gave
me
a
few
pointers
and
told
me
to
look
out
for
the
horse
was
especially
bad
on
pitching
i
told
jim
i
was
a
good
rider
and
not
afraid
of
him
i
thought
i
had
rode
pitching
horses
before
but
from
the
time
i
mounted
old
good
eye
i
knew
i
had
not
learned
what
pitching
was
this
proved
the
worst
horse
to
ride
i
had
ever
mounted
in
my
life
but
i
stayed
with
him
and
the
cow
boys
were
the
most
surprised
outfit
you
ever
saw
as
they
had
taken
me
for
a
tenderfoot
pure
and
simple
after
the
horse
got
tired
and
i
dismounted
the
boss
said
he
would
give
me
a
job
and
pay
me
per
month
and
more
later
on
he
asked
what
my
name
was
and
i
answered
nat
love
he
said
to
the
boys
we
will
call
him
red
river
dick
i
went
by
this
name
for
a
long
time
the
boss
took
me
to
the
city
and
got
my
outfit
which
consisted
of
a
new
saddle
bridle
and
spurs
chaps
a
pair
of
blankets
and
a
fine
colt
revolver
now
that
the
business
which
brought
them
to
dodge
city
was
concluded
preparations
were
made
to
start
out
for
the
pan
handle
country
in
texas
to
the
home
ranch
the
outfit
of
which
i
was
now
a
member
was
called
the
duval
outfit
and
their
brand
was
known
as
the
pig
pen
brand
i
worked
with
this
outfit
for
over
three
years
on
this
trip
there
were
only
about
fifteen
of
us
riders
all
excepting
myself
were
hardy
experienced
men
always
ready
for
anything
that
might
turn
up
but
they
were
as
jolly
a
set
of
fellows
as
one
could
find
in
a
long
journey
there
now
being
nothing
to
keep
us
longer
in
dodge
city
we
prepared
for
the
return
journey
and
left
the
next
day
over
the
old
dodge
and
sun
city
lonesome
trail
on
a
journey
which
was
to
prove
the
most
eventful
of
my
life
up
to
now
a
few
miles
out
we
encountered
some
of
the
hardest
hail
storms
i
ever
saw
causing
discomfort
to
man
and
beast
but
i
had
no
notion
of
getting
discouraged
but
i
resolved
to
be
always
ready
for
any
call
that
might
be
made
on
me
of
whatever
nature
it
might
be
and
those
with
whom
i
have
lived
and
worked
will
tell
you
i
have
kept
that
resolve
not
far
from
dodge
city
on
our
way
home
we
encountered
a
band
of
the
old
victoria
tribe
of
indians
and
had
a
sharp
fight
these
indians
were
nearly
always
harrassing
travelers
and
traders
and
the
stock
men
of
that
part
of
the
country
and
were
very
troublesome
in
this
band
we
encountered
there
were
about
a
hundred
painted
bucks
all
well
mounted
when
we
saw
the
indians
they
were
coming
after
us
yelling
like
demons
as
we
were
not
expecting
indians
at
this
particular
time
we
were
taken
somewhat
by
surprise
we
only
had
fifteen
men
in
our
outfit
but
nothing
daunted
we
stood
our
ground
and
fought
the
indians
to
a
stand
one
of
the
boys
was
shot
off
his
horse
and
killed
near
me
the
indians
got
his
horse
bridle
and
saddle
during
this
fight
we
lost
all
but
six
of
our
horses
our
entire
packing
outfit
and
our
extra
saddle
horses
which
the
indians
stampeded
then
rounded
them
up
after
the
fight
and
drove
them
off
and
as
we
only
had
six
horses
left
us
we
were
unable
to
follow
them
although
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
we
had
made
several
good
indians
out
of
bad
ones
this
was
my
first
indian
fight
and
likewise
the
first
indians
i
had
ever
seen
when
i
saw
them
coming
after
us
and
heard
their
blood
curdling
yell
i
lost
all
courage
and
thought
my
time
had
come
to
die
i
was
too
badly
scared
to
run
some
of
the
boys
told
me
to
use
my
gun
and
shoot
for
all
i
was
worth
now
i
had
just
got
my
outfit
and
had
never
shot
off
a
gun
in
my
life
but
their
words
brought
me
back
to
earth
and
seeing
they
were
all
using
their
guns
in
a
way
that
showed
they
were
used
to
it
i
unlimbered
my
artillery
and
after
the
first
shot
i
lost
all
fear
and
fought
like
a
veteran
we
soon
routed
the
indians
and
they
left
taking
with
them
nearly
all
we
had
and
we
were
powerless
to
pursue
them
we
were
compelled
to
finish
our
journey
home
almost
on
foot
as
there
were
only
six
horses
left
to
fourteen
of
us
our
friend
and
companion
who
was
shot
in
the
fight
we
buried
on
the
plains
wrapped
in
his
blanket
with
stones
piled
over
his
grave
after
this
engagement
with
the
indians
i
seemed
to
lose
all
sense
as
to
what
fear
was
and
thereafter
during
my
whole
life
on
the
range
i
never
experienced
the
least
feeling
of
fear
no
matter
how
trying
the
ordeal
or
how
desperate
my
position
the
home
ranch
was
located
on
the
palo
duro
river
in
the
western
part
of
the
pan
handle
texas
which
we
reached
in
the
latter
part
of
may
it
taking
us
considerably
over
a
month
to
make
the
return
journey
home
from
dodge
city
i
remained
in
the
employ
of
the
duval
outfit
for
three
years
making
regular
trips
to
dodge
city
every
season
and
to
many
other
places
in
the
surrounding
states
with
herds
of
horses
and
cattle
for
market
and
to
be
delivered
to
other
ranch
owners
all
over
texas
wyoming
and
the
dakotas
by
strict
attention
to
business
born
of
a
genuine
love
of
the
free
and
wild
life
of
the
range
and
absolute
fearlessness
i
became
known
throughout
the
country
as
a
good
all
around
cow
boy
and
a
splendid
hand
in
a
stampede
after
returning
from
one
of
our
trips
north
with
a
bunch
of
cattle
in
the
fall
of
i
received
and
accepted
a
better
position
with
the
pete
gallinger
company
whose
immense
range
was
located
on
the
gila
river
in
southern
arizona
so
after
drawing
the
balance
of
my
pay
from
the
duval
company
and
bidding
good
bye
to
the
true
and
tried
companions
of
the
past
three
years
who
had
learned
me
the
business
and
been
with
me
in
many
a
trying
situation
it
was
with
genuine
regret
that
i
left
them
for
my
new
position
one
that
meant
more
to
me
in
pay
and
experience
i
stayed
with
pete
gallinger
company
for
several
years
and
soon
became
one
of
their
most
trusted
men
taking
an
important
part
in
all
the
big
and
cuttings
throughout
western
texas
arizona
and
other
states
where
the
company
had
interests
to
be
looked
after
sometimes
riding
eighty
miles
a
day
for
days
at
a
time
over
the
trails
of
texas
and
the
surrounding
country
and
naturally
i
soon
became
well
known
among
the
cowboys
rangers
scouts
and
guides
it
was
my
pleasure
to
meet
in
my
wanderings
over
the
country
in
the
wake
of
immense
herds
of
the
long
horned
texas
cattle
and
large
bands
of
range
horses
many
of
these
men
who
were
my
companions
on
the
trail
and
in
camp
have
since
become
famous
in
story
and
history
and
a
braver
truer
set
of
men
never
lived
than
these
wild
sons
of
the
plains
whose
home
was
in
the
saddle
and
their
couch
mother
earth
with
the
sky
for
a
covering
they
were
always
ready
to
share
their
blanket
and
their
last
ration
with
a
less
fortunate
fellow
companion
and
always
assisted
each
other
in
the
many
trying
situations
that
were
continually
coming
up
in
a
cowboy
life
when
we
were
not
on
the
trail
taking
large
herds
of
cattle
or
horses
to
market
or
to
be
delivered
to
other
ranches
we
were
engaged
in
range
riding
moving
large
numbers
of
cattle
from
one
grazing
range
to
another
keeping
them
together
and
hunting
up
strays
which
despite
the
most
earnest
efforts
of
the
range
riders
would
get
away
from
the
main
herd
and
wander
for
miles
over
the
plains
before
they
could
be
found
overtaken
and
returned
to
the
main
herd
then
the
indians
and
the
white
outlaws
who
infested
the
country
gave
us
no
end
of
trouble
as
they
lost
no
opportunity
to
cut
out
and
run
off
the
choicest
part
of
a
herd
of
long
horns
or
the
best
of
a
band
of
horses
causing
the
cowboys
a
ride
of
many
a
long
mile
over
the
dusty
plains
in
pursuit
and
many
are
the
fierce
engagements
we
had
when
after
a
long
chase
of
perhaps
hundreds
of
miles
over
the
ranges
we
overtook
the
thieves
it
then
became
a
case
of
to
the
victor
belongs
the
spoils
as
there
was
no
law
respected
in
this
wild
country
except
the
law
of
might
and
the
persuasive
qualities
of
the
colt
pistol
accordingly
it
became
absolutely
necessary
for
a
cowboy
to
understand
his
gun
and
know
how
to
place
its
contents
where
it
would
do
the
most
good
therefore
i
in
common
with
my
other
companions
never
lost
an
opportunity
to
practice
with
my
colts
and
the
opportunities
were
not
lacking
by
any
means
and
so
in
time
i
became
fairly
proficient
and
able
in
most
cases
to
hit
a
barn
door
providing
the
door
was
not
too
far
away
and
was
steadily
improving
in
this
as
i
was
in
experience
and
knowledge
of
the
other
branches
of
the
business
which
i
had
chosen
as
my
life
work
and
which
i
had
begun
to
like
so
well
because
while
the
life
was
hard
and
in
some
ways
exacting
yet
it
was
free
and
wild
and
contained
the
elements
of
danger
which
my
nature
craved
and
which
began
to
manifest
itself
when
i
was
a
pugnacious
youngster
on
the
old
plantation
in
our
rock
battles
and
the
breaking
of
the
wild
horses
i
gloried
in
the
danger
and
the
wild
and
free
life
of
the
plains
the
new
country
i
was
continually
traversing
and
the
many
new
scenes
and
incidents
continually
arising
in
the
life
of
a
rough
rider

reader
the
big
riding
the
steer
long
rides
hunting
strays
having
now
fairly
begun
my
life
as
a
cowboy
i
was
fast
learning
the
many
ins
and
outs
of
the
business
while
my
many
roamings
over
the
range
country
gave
me
a
knowledge
of
it
not
possessed
by
many
at
that
time
being
of
a
naturally
observant
disposition
i
noticed
many
things
to
which
others
attached
no
significance
this
quality
of
observance
proved
of
incalculable
benefit
to
me
in
many
ways
during
my
life
as
a
range
rider
in
the
western
country
my
employment
with
the
pete
gallinger
company
took
me
all
over
the
pan
handle
country
texas
arizona
and
new
mexico
with
herds
of
horses
and
cattle
for
market
and
to
be
delivered
to
other
ranch
owners
and
large
cattle
breeders
naturally
i
became
very
well
acquainted
with
all
the
many
different
trails
and
grazing
ranges
located
in
the
stretch
of
country
between
the
north
of
montana
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
between
the
missouri
state
line
and
the
pacific
ocean
this
whole
territory
i
have
covered
many
times
in
the
saddle
sometimes
at
the
rate
of
eighty
or
one
hundred
miles
a
day
these
long
rides
and
much
traveling
over
the
country
were
of
great
benefit
to
me
as
it
enabled
me
to
meet
so
many
different
people
connected
with
the
cattle
business
and
also
to
learn
the
different
trails
and
the
lay
of
the
country
generally
among
the
other
things
that
i
picked
up
on
my
wanderings
was
a
knowledge
of
the
spanish
language
which
i
learned
to
speak
like
a
native
i
also
became
very
well
acquainted
with
the
many
different
brands
scattered
over
this
stretch
of
country
consequently
it
was
not
long
before
the
cattle
men
began
to
recognize
my
worth
and
the
gallinger
company
made
me
their
chief
brand
reader
which
duties
i
performed
for
several
years
with
honor
to
myself
and
satisfaction
to
my
employers
in
the
cattle
country
all
the
large
cattle
raisers
had
their
squad
of
brand
readers
whose
duty
it
was
to
attend
all
the
big
and
cuttings
throughout
the
country
and
to
pick
out
their
own
brands
and
to
see
that
the
different
brands
were
not
altered
or
counterfeited
they
also
had
to
look
to
the
branding
of
the
young
stock
during
the
big
it
was
our
duty
to
pick
out
our
brand
and
then
send
them
home
under
the
charge
of
our
cowboys
likewise
the
newly
branded
stock
after
each
brand
was
cut
out
and
started
homeward
we
had
to
stay
with
the
round
up
to
see
that
strays
from
the
different
herds
from
the
surrounding
country
did
not
again
get
mixed
up
until
the
different
home
ranges
were
reached
this
work
employed
a
large
number
of
cowboys
who
lived
ate
and
often
slept
in
the
saddle
as
they
covered
many
hundreds
of
miles
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
this
was
made
possible
as
every
large
cattleman
had
relays
of
horses
sent
out
over
the
country
where
we
might
be
expected
to
touch
and
so
we
could
always
count
on
finding
a
fresh
horse
awaiting
us
at
the
end
of
a
or
a
fifty
mile
ride
but
for
us
brand
readers
there
was
no
rest
we
merely
changed
our
saddles
and
outfit
to
a
fresh
horse
and
were
again
on
the
go
after
the
general
round
up
was
over
cowboy
sports
and
a
good
time
generally
was
in
order
for
those
engaged
in
it
the
interest
of
nearly
all
of
us
centered
in
the
riding
of
what
was
known
as
the
steer
a
big
long
horn
wild
steer
generally
the
worst
in
the
herd
was
cut
out
and
turned
loose
on
the
open
prairie
the
cow
boy
who
could
rope
and
ride
him
would
get
the
steer
as
his
reward
and
let
me
assure
you
dear
reader
that
it
was
not
so
easy
as
it
sounds
as
the
steer
separated
from
its
fellows
would
become
extremely
ferocious
and
wild
and
the
man
who
attempted
to
rope
and
ride
him
would
be
in
momentary
danger
of
losing
his
life
if
he
relaxed
in
the
least
his
vigilance
and
caution
because
a
wild
steer
is
naturally
ferocious
even
in
cutting
them
out
of
the
round
up
i
have
known
them
to
get
mad
and
attack
the
cowboys
who
only
saved
themselves
by
the
quickness
of
their
horses
or
the
friendly
intervention
of
a
comrade
who
happened
to
be
near
to
rope
the
maddened
long
horn
and
thus
divert
his
attention
to
other
things
but
in
the
case
of
the
steer
such
intervention
is
against
the
rules
and
the
cowboy
who
attempts
to
rope
and
ride
the
steer
must
at
all
times
look
out
for
himself
i
have
seen
two
horses
and
their
riders
gored
to
death
in
this
sport
and
i
have
had
to
shoot
more
than
one
steer
to
save
myself
and
horse
after
my
horse
had
fallen
with
me
and
placed
himself
as
well
as
me
at
the
maddened
beast
mercy
at
such
times
it
takes
a
cool
head
and
a
steady
hand
as
no
random
shot
will
stop
a
wild
steer
the
bullet
must
be
placed
in
a
certain
spot
the
center
of
the
forehead
to
accomplish
its
mission
the
last
time
i
had
a
horse
fall
with
me
in
roping
the
steer
he
fell
as
the
steer
was
but
a
few
feet
away
falling
in
such
a
way
that
my
leg
caught
under
the
saddle
holding
me
fast
quick
as
i
could
i
gave
the
steer
a
bullet
in
the
head
and
he
stumbled
and
fell
dead
on
top
of
my
horse
and
me
so
that
the
boys
had
to
interfere
to
the
extent
of
dragging
the
steer
and
horse
off
of
my
leg
illustration
riding
the
steer
the
cowboy
who
is
successful
in
roping
the
steer
must
then
mount
and
ride
him
if
he
does
that
successfully
the
steer
becomes
his
personal
property
to
do
with
as
he
will
only
a
slight
reward
for
the
risking
of
his
life
and
the
trouble
of
accomplishing
the
feat
but
it
is
done
more
for
sport
sake
than
anything
else
and
the
love
of
showing
off
a
weakness
of
all
cow
boys
more
or
less
but
really
it
takes
a
high
class
of
horsemanship
to
ride
a
long
horn
to
get
on
his
back
and
stay
there
as
he
runs
jumps
pitches
side
ways
backwards
forward
up
and
down
then
over
the
prairie
like
a
streak
of
lightning
i
have
had
the
experience
and
i
can
assure
you
it
is
no
child
play
more
than
one
steer
has
fallen
to
my
lot
but
i
had
to
work
for
it
and
work
hard
after
all
it
was
only
part
of
the
general
routine
of
the
cow
boy
life
in
which
danger
plays
so
important
a
part
it
is
seldom
thought
of
being
merely
a
matter
of
course
and
none
of
us
would
have
foregone
the
sport
had
we
known
that
sure
death
awaited
us
as
the
result
because
above
all
things
the
test
of
a
cow
boy
worth
is
his
gameness
and
his
nerve
he
is
not
supposed
to
know
what
fear
means
and
i
assure
you
there
are
very
few
who
know
the
meaning
of
that
word
most
of
my
readers
no
doubt
have
heard
of
the
great
round
ups
and
cuttings
connected
with
the
cattle
raiser
life
but
not
one
in
a
hundred
has
any
idea
as
to
how
an
immense
herd
of
wild
cattle
are
handled
in
a
big
round
up
my
many
years
of
experience
has
given
me
unusual
knowledge
on
the
subject
and
you
may
bring
any
cattleman
or
boss
to
me
and
i
will
guarantee
to
answer
any
question
he
can
ask
me
about
the
cattle
business
the
first
general
round
up
occurs
about
the
first
of
april
this
round
up
is
to
run
in
all
the
near
cattle
belonging
to
each
man
and
head
them
toward
our
respective
ranges
if
we
find
any
other
brand
mixed
up
with
ours
we
head
them
toward
their
own
range
and
keep
our
own
together
every
cow
boy
does
the
same
and
in
this
way
every
cattleman
is
enable
to
get
his
own
brand
together
on
his
own
range
so
that
when
the
next
general
round
up
occurs
he
will
have
most
of
his
near
cattle
together
on
the
home
range
in
order
to
get
the
cattle
together
in
the
first
general
round
up
we
would
have
to
ride
for
hundreds
of
miles
over
the
country
in
search
of
the
long
horn
steers
and
old
cows
that
had
drifted
from
the
home
range
during
the
winter
and
were
now
scattered
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
as
soon
as
they
were
found
they
were
started
off
under
the
care
of
cow
boys
for
the
place
agreed
upon
for
the
general
round
up
whether
they
belonged
to
us
or
not
while
the
rest
of
us
continued
the
search
all
the
cow
boys
from
the
many
different
outfits
working
this
way
enabled
us
to
soon
get
all
the
strays
rounded
up
in
one
great
herd
in
which
the
cattle
of
a
dozen
different
owners
were
mixed
up
together
it
then
became
our
duty
to
cut
out
our
different
herds
and
start
them
homewards
then
we
had
to
brand
the
young
stock
that
had
escaped
that
ordeal
at
the
hands
of
the
range
riders
on
finding
the
strays
and
starting
them
homewards
we
had
to
keep
up
the
search
because
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
we
had
done
range
riding
or
line
riding
all
winter
a
large
number
of
cattle
would
manage
to
evade
the
vigilance
of
the
cow
boys
and
get
away
these
must
all
be
accounted
for
at
the
great
round
up
as
they
stood
for
dollars
and
cents
profit
and
loss
to
the
great
cattle
kings
of
the
west
in
going
after
these
strayed
and
perhaps
stolen
cattle
we
boys
always
provided
ourselves
with
everything
we
needed
including
plenty
of
grub
as
sometimes
we
would
be
gone
for
nearly
two
months
and
sometimes
much
longer
it
was
not
an
uncommon
occurrence
for
us
to
have
shooting
trouble
over
our
different
brands
in
such
disputes
the
boys
would
kill
each
other
if
others
did
not
interfere
in
time
to
prevent
it
because
in
those
days
on
the
great
cattle
ranges
there
was
no
law
but
the
law
of
might
and
all
disputes
were
settled
with
a
colt
pistol
in
such
cases
the
man
who
was
quickest
on
the
draw
and
whose
eye
was
the
best
pretty
generally
got
the
decision
therefore
it
was
of
the
greatest
importance
that
the
cow
boy
should
understand
his
gun
its
capabilities
and
its
shooting
qualities
a
cow
boy
would
never
carry
anything
but
the
very
best
gun
obtainable
as
his
life
depended
on
it
often
after
securing
a
good
gun
the
cow
boy
had
to
learn
how
to
use
it
if
he
did
not
already
know
how
in
doing
so
no
trouble
or
expense
was
spared
and
i
know
there
were
very
few
poor
shots
on
the
ranges
over
which
we
rode
and
they
used
the
accomplishment
to
protect
themselves
and
their
employer
cattle
from
the
indian
thiefs
and
the
white
desperadoes
who
infested
the
cattle
country
and
who
lost
no
opportunity
to
stampede
the
herds
and
run
off
large
numbers
of
them
whenever
this
happened
it
generally
resulted
in
a
long
chase
and
a
fierce
fight
in
which
someone
was
sure
to
get
hurt
and
hurt
badly
but
that
fact
did
not
bother
us
in
the
least
it
was
all
simply
our
duty
and
our
business
for
which
we
were
paid
and
paid
good
and
so
we
accepted
things
as
they
came
always
ready
for
it
whatever
it
might
be
and
always
taking
pride
in
our
work
in
which
we
always
tried
to
excel
christmas
is
a
day
in
my
memory
which
time
can
not
blot
out
i
and
a
number
of
friends
were
in
a
place
called
holbrook
a
dispute
started
over
a
saddle
horse
with
the
following
result
arizona
bob
drew
his
colt
revolver
but
before
he
had
time
to
fire
he
was
instantly
killed
by
jack
then
a
general
fight
ensued
in
which
five
horses
and
three
men
were
killed
it
was
a
sad
thing
for
me
to
see
my
friends
dead
in
a
corral
on
a
christmas
morning
but
i
helped
bury
the
dead
and
took
care
of
the
wounded
the
names
were
jack

the
elements
after
business
comes
pleasure
after
the
round
ups
and
on
returning
from
our
long
rides
after
strayed
cattle
we
would
have
to
prepare
to
take
the
trail
with
herds
of
cattle
and
horses
for
market
and
to
be
delivered
to
other
large
ranch
owners
the
party
of
cow
boys
to
make
these
trips
were
all
selected
men
we
would
spend
several
days
at
the
home
ranch
resting
up
and
preparing
our
outfit
in
which
our
guns
saddles
blankets
and
horses
were
given
a
thorough
overhauling
and
placed
in
first
class
condition
as
they
would
be
called
on
to
do
good
hard
service
on
these
trips
on
the
trail
the
nature
of
our
journey
would
depend
very
much
on
the
kind
of
cattle
we
were
called
upon
to
handle
sometimes
it
would
be
all
classes
together
on
other
occasions
the
herd
would
consist
of
a
certain
kind
such
as
long
yearlings
short
yearlings
tail
end
and
scabs
the
larger
demand
however
seemed
to
be
for
straight
three
and
four
year
old
steers
these
latter
kind
were
the
easiest
to
handle
on
the
trail
it
is
no
doubt
necessary
that
i
explain
the
difference
between
the
different
kinds
i
mention
here
short
yearlings
were
those
over
one
year
old
and
short
of
two
years
long
yearlings
those
two
years
and
short
of
three
years
tail
end
and
scabs
mean
nearly
the
same
thing
and
comprise
all
the
very
young
stock
of
all
classes
not
yet
reached
the
dignity
of
yearlings
these
latter
were
in
demand
from
the
cattle
men
who
took
them
to
feed
until
they
got
their
growth
or
to
raise
from
as
stock

old
were
generally
the
market
or
beef
cattle
these
latter
were
by
all
odds
the
easiest
to
handle
on
the
trail
sometimes
we
would
have
an
order
for
five
or
six
hundred
head
of
all
classes
of
cattle
then
again
we
would
have
to
start
out
with
fifteen
hundred
head
of
shipping
steers
or
several
hundred
head
of
horses
shortly
after
i
entered
the
employ
of
the
pete
gallinger
company
and
after
the
of
the
early
season
we
received
an
order
for
two
thousand
five
hundred
head
of
three
year
old
steers
to
be
delivered
at
dodge
city
kansas
this
was
the
largest
herd
i
had
up
to
the
present
time
followed
good
rest
at
the
home
ranch
we
strung
the
large
herd
out
with
two
months
provisions
and
the
camp
wagon
after
a
and
one
hundred
extra
saddle
horses
and
several
pack
horses
on
the
trail
our
outfit
consisted
of
forty
picked
cow
boys
along
the
old
chillers
trail
en
route
for
kansas
and
we
started
on
what
proved
to
be
an
eventful
journey
the
herd
behaved
splendidly
and
gave
us
very
little
trouble
until
we
crossed
the
red
river
and
struck
the
old
dog
and
sun
city
trail
here
they
became
restless
and
stampeded
nearly
every
night
and
whenever
they
got
half
a
chance
this
made
it
very
hard
on
us
cowboys
as
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
ride
the
lines
of
such
a
large
herd
let
alone
having
to
chase
them
back
in
line
from
many
miles
over
the
prairie
where
they
had
stampeded
in
their
wild
career
after
crossing
the
kansas
line
at
a
place
known
as
the
south
forks
while
making
for
the
head
of
the
cimarron
river
on
the
of
june
we
experienced
one
of
the
hardest
rain
and
hail
storms
i
had
ever
seen
in
the
western
country
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
only
to
cease
and
give
place
to
hail
stones
the
size
of
walnuts
while
the
thunder
and
lightning
was
incessant
it
was
shortly
after
dark
when
the
storm
commenced
the
hundred
head
of
cattle
strung
out
along
the
trail
became
panic
stricken
and
stampeded
and
despite
our
utmost
efforts
we
were
unable
to
keep
them
in
line
imagine
my
dear
reader
riding
your
horse
at
the
top
of
his
speed
through
torrents
of
rain
and
hail
and
darkness
so
black
that
we
could
not
see
our
horses
heads
chasing
an
immense
herd
of
maddened
cattle
which
we
could
hear
but
could
not
see
except
during
the
vivid
flashes
of
lightning
which
furnished
our
only
light
it
was
the
worst
ride
i
ever
experienced
late
the
next
morning
we
had
the
herd
rounded
up
thirty
miles
from
where
they
started
from
the
night
before
on
going
back
over
the
country
to
our
camp
of
the
night
before
we
saw
the
great
danger
we
had
been
in
during
our
mad
ride
there
were
holes
cliffs
gulleys
and
big
rocks
scattered
all
around
some
of
the
cliffs
going
down
a
sheer
fifty
feet
or
more
where
if
we
had
fallen
over
we
would
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
below
but
we
never
thought
of
our
personal
danger
that
night
and
we
did
not
think
particularly
of
it
when
we
saw
it
further
than
to
make
a
few
joking
remarks
about
what
would
have
happened
if
some
one
of
us
had
gone
over
one
of
the
boys
offered
to
bet
that
a
horse
and
rider
going
over
one
of
those
cliffs
would
bring
up
in
china
while
others
thought
he
would
bring
up
in
utah
it
was
our
duty
to
save
the
cattle
and
every
thing
else
was
of
secondary
importance
we
never
lost
a
single
steer
during
this
wild
night
something
we
were
justly
proud
of
this
proved
the
last
trouble
we
were
to
have
with
the
herd
and
we
soon
reached
the
five
mile
divide
five
miles
from
dodge
city
without
further
incident
and
with
our
herd
intact
here
we
were
to
hold
them
until
turned
over
to
their
new
owners
this
accomplished
our
work
was
done
and
done
well
for
this
trip
then
we
all
headed
for
dodge
city
to
have
a
good
time
and
i
assure
you
we
had
it
it
was
our
intention
and
ambition
to
paint
the
town
a
deep
red
color
and
drink
up
all
the
bad
whiskey
in
the
city
our
nearly
two
months
journey
over
the
dusty
plains
and
ranges
had
made
us
all
inordinately
thirsty
and
wild
and
here
is
where
we
had
our
turn
accordingly
we
started
out
to
do
the
town
in
true
western
style
in
which
we
were
perfectly
successful
until
the
town
had
done
us
and
we
were
dead
broke
this
fact
slowed
us
up
because
being
broke
we
could
not
get
up
any
more
steam
and
we
had
to
cool
down
right
there
we
then
started
out
to
find
our
boss
but
that
gentleman
being
wise
in
his
time
and
generation
and
knowing
we
would
soon
all
be
broke
and
would
be
wanting
more
money
and
that
he
would
let
us
have
it
if
we
asked
him
for
it
only
to
be
thrown
away
he
made
himself
scarce
and
he
kept
out
of
our
sight
until
we
cooled
off
for
my
part
i
would
not
spend
all
my
money
i
would
draw
about
fifty
dollars
then
i
would
get
what
things
i
wanted
and
then
would
let
the
other
go
free
but
while
our
money
lasted
we
would
certainly
enjoy
ourselves
in
dancing
drinking
and
shooting
up
the
town
it
was
our
delight
to
give
exhibitions
of
rough
riding
roping
and
everything
else
we
could
think
of
to
make
things
go
fast
enough
to
suit
our
ideas
of
speed
after
several
days
spent
in
this
manner
we
would
begin
to
make
ready
to
start
on
the
return
journey
home
to
texas
we
left
dodge
city
on
the
first
of
july
and
on
the
fifteenth
of
august
we
were
back
on
the
old
home
ranch
where
we
rested
up
a
few
days
before
again
starting
out
to
ride
the
range
after
the
long
horns
again
as
i
was
a
brand
reader
i
had
little
time
to
rest
as
my
services
were
in
demand
from
many
of
the
large
cattle
kings
of
texas
and
arizona
and
when
ever
a
dispute
arose
over
brands
i
was
generally
sent
for
to
straighten
matters
out
this
with
the
numerous
round
ups
which
i
had
to
attend
and
the
many
transfers
of
cattle
throughout
the
pan
handle
country
kept
me
continually
on
the
go
when
my
services
were
not
needed
as
a
brand
reader
i
rode
the
range
along
with
the
other
cow
boys
this
kept
us
almost
continually
in
the
saddle
and
away
from
the
home
ranch
for
days
at
a
time
when
this
was
the
case
our
food
consisted
of
biscuit
and
cakes
which
we
made
ourselves
from
meal
which
we
carried
with
us
and
such
meat
and
game
as
we
could
knock
over
with
our
guns
we
camped
wherever
it
suited
and
where
there
was
feed
for
our
horses
a
cow
first
care
is
always
after
his
gun
and
his
horse
that
animal
often
meaning
life
and
liberty
to
the
cow
boy
in
a
tight
place
and
the
cow
boy
without
a
horse
is
like
a
chicken
without
its
head
completely
lost
my
faithful
horse
has
times
without
number
carried
me
out
of
danger
and
preserved
my
life
we
were
not
destined
to
have
much
rest
this
season
as
shortly
after
we
returned
from
the
trip
to
dodge
city
the
boss
bought
a
large
herd
of
cattle
down
on
the
rio
grande
just
over
the
line
in
mexico
which
we
had
orders
for
so
we
had
to
start
out
and
round
them
up
this
was
no
easy
matter
as
they
were
scattered
over
a
large
range
of
territory
and
many
strays
had
to
be
rounded
up
and
got
with
the
main
herd
this
we
finally
accomplished
after
a
great
deal
of
hard
riding
over
the
rough
rio
grande
country
and
both
men
and
horses
were
completely
tired
out
so
we
went
into
camp
only
holding
the
herd
together
and
getting
rested
up
this
opportunity
we
improved
by
getting
acquainted
and
fraternizing
with
the
cow
boys
of
one
of
the
oldest
cattle
countries
this
side
of
the
herring
pond
old
mexico
these
men
were
for
the
most
part
typical
greasers
but
they
proved
to
us
that
they
knew
a
thing
or
two
about
the
cattle
business
and
all
things
considered
they
were
a
jolly
companionable
sort
of
an
outfit
from
them
we
learned
a
few
pointers
and
also
gave
them
a
few
very
much
to
our
mutual
benefit
we
remained
here
a
few
days
before
starting
northward
with
our
herd
but
these
few
days
proved
very
pleasant
ones
to
us
boys
who
on
account
of
the
monotony
of
the
life
we
led
always
welcomed
new
experiences
or
events
that
would
give
us
something
to
think
and
talk
about
while
on
our
long
rides
behind
the
slow
moving
herd
of
steers
or
around
our
camp
fires
when
in
camp
on
the
plains
and
it
gave
us
especial
pleasure
to
meet
men
of
the
same
calling
from
other
states
over
the
west
it
not
only
gave
us
pleasure
but
it
added
to
our
cow
knowledge
and
of
the
country
over
which
we
might
at
any
time
be
called
on
to
drive
cattle
and
in
such
cases
a
knowledge
of
the
country
was
most
valuable
to
us
then
a
cow
boy
life
contains
many
things
in
which
he
is
continually
trying
to
improve
and
excel
such
as
roping
shooting
riding
and
branding
and
many
other
things
connected
with
the
cattle
business
we
in
common
with
other
trades
did
not
know
it
all
and
we
were
always
ready
to
learn
anything
new
when
we
met
any
one
who
was
capable
of
teaching
us

plunging
snorting
bellowing
mass
of
horns
and
hoofs
after
getting
the
cattle
together
down
on
the
rio
grande
and
both
man
and
beast
had
got
somewhat
rested
up
we
started
the
herd
north
they
were
to
be
delivered
to
a
man
by
the
name
of
mitchell
whose
ranch
was
located
along
the
powder
river
up
in
northern
wyoming
it
was
a
long
distance
to
drive
cattle
from
old
mexico
to
northern
wyoming
but
to
us
it
was
nothing
extraordinary
as
we
were
often
called
on
to
make
even
greater
distances
as
the
railroads
were
not
so
common
then
as
now
and
transportation
by
rail
was
very
little
resorted
to
and
except
when
beef
cattle
were
sent
to
the
far
east
they
were
always
transported
on
the
hoof
overland
our
route
lay
through
southern
texas
indian
territory
kansas
and
nebraska
to
the
shoshone
mountains
in
northern
wyoming
we
had
on
this
trip
five
hundred
head
of
mostly
four
year
old
long
horn
steers
we
did
not
have
much
trouble
with
them
until
we
struck
indian
territory
on
nearing
the
first
indian
reservation
we
were
stopped
by
a
large
body
of
indian
bucks
who
said
we
could
not
pass
through
their
country
unless
we
gave
them
a
steer
for
the
privilege
now
as
we
were
following
the
regular
government
trail
which
was
a
free
public
highway
it
did
not
strike
us
as
justifiable
to
pay
our
way
accordingly
our
boss
flatly
refused
to
give
the
indians
a
steer
remarking
that
we
needed
all
the
cattle
we
had
and
proposed
to
keep
them
but
he
would
not
mind
giving
them
something
much
warmer
if
they
interfered
with
us
this
ultimatum
of
our
boss
had
the
effect
of
starting
trouble
right
there
we
went
into
camp
at
the
edge
of
the
indian
country
all
around
us
was
the
tall
blue
grass
of
that
region
which
in
places
was
higher
than
a
horse
affording
an
ideal
hiding
place
for
the
indians
as
we
expected
an
attack
from
the
indians
the
boss
arranged
strong
watches
to
keep
a
keen
lookout
we
had
no
sooner
finished
making
camp
when
the
indians
showed
up
and
charged
us
with
a
yell
or
rather
a
series
of
yells
i
for
one
had
got
well
used
to
the
blood
curdling
yells
of
the
indians
and
they
did
not
scare
us
in
the
least
we
were
all
ready
for
them
and
after
a
short
but
sharp
fight
the
indians
withdrew
and
every
thing
became
quiet
but
us
cow
boys
were
not
such
guys
as
to
be
fooled
by
the
seeming
quietness
we
knew
it
was
only
the
calm
before
the
storm
and
we
prepared
ourselves
accordingly
but
we
were
all
dead
tired
and
it
was
necessary
that
we
secure
as
much
rest
as
possible
so
the
low
watch
turned
in
to
rest
until
midnight
when
they
were
to
relieve
the
upper
watch
in
whose
hands
the
safety
of
the
camp
was
placed
till
that
time
every
man
slept
with
his
boots
on
and
his
gun
near
his
hand
we
had
been
sleeping
several
hours
but
it
seemed
to
me
only
a
few
minutes
when
the
danger
signal
was
given
immediately
every
man
was
on
his
feet
gun
in
hand
and
ready
for
business
the
indians
had
secured
reinforcements
and
after
dividing
in
two
bands
one
band
hid
in
the
tall
grass
in
order
to
pick
us
off
and
shoot
us
as
we
attempted
to
hold
our
cattle
while
the
other
band
proceeded
to
stampede
the
herd
but
fortunately
there
were
enough
of
us
to
prevent
the
herd
from
stringing
out
on
us
as
we
gave
our
first
attention
to
the
cattle
we
got
them
to
merling
back
and
forward
through
the
tall
grass
the
large
herd
charged
the
indians
being
kept
too
busy
keeping
out
of
their
way
to
have
much
time
to
bother
with
us
this
kept
up
until
daylight
but
long
before
that
time
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
the
worst
herd
of
cattle
to
stampede
we
ever
struck
they
seemed
perfectly
crazy
even
after
the
last
indian
had
disappeared
we
were
unable
to
account
for
the
strange
actions
of
the
cattle
until
daylight
when
the
mystery
was
a
mystery
no
longer
the
indians
in
large
numbers
had
hid
in
the
tall
grass
for
the
purpose
of
shooting
us
from
ambush
and
being
on
foot
they
were
unable
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
herd
as
it
stampeded
through
the
grass
the
result
was
that
scores
of
the
painted
savages
were
trampled
under
the
hoofs
of
the
maddened
cattle
and
in
the
early
gray
dawn
of
the
approaching
day
we
witnessed
a
horrible
sight
the
indians
were
all
cut
to
pieces
their
heads
limbs
trunk
and
blankets
all
being
ground
up
in
an
inseparable
mass
as
if
they
had
been
through
a
sausage
machine
the
sight
was
all
the
more
horrible
as
we
did
not
know
the
indians
were
hidden
in
the
grass
during
the
night
but
their
presence
there
accounted
for
the
strange
actions
of
the
herd
during
the
night
we
suffered
no
loss
or
damage
except
the
loss
of
our
rest
which
we
sorely
needed
as
we
were
all
pretty
well
played
out
however
we
thought
it
advisable
to
move
our
herd
on
to
a
more
desirable
and
safe
camping
place
not
that
we
greatly
feared
any
more
trouble
from
the
indians
not
soon
at
any
rate
but
only
to
be
better
prepared
and
in
better
shape
to
put
up
a
fight
if
attacked
the
second
night
we
camped
on
the
open
plain
where
the
grass
was
not
so
high
and
where
the
camp
could
be
better
guarded
after
eating
our
supper
and
placing
the
usual
watch
the
men
again
turned
in
expecting
this
time
to
get
a
good
night
rest
it
was
my
turn
to
take
the
first
watch
and
with
the
other
boys
who
were
to
watch
with
me
we
took
up
advantageous
positions
on
the
lookout
everything
soon
became
still
the
night
was
dark
and
sultry
it
was
getting
along
toward
midnight
when
all
at
once
we
became
aware
of
a
roaring
noise
in
the
north
like
thunder
slowly
growing
louder
as
it
approached
and
i
said
to
the
boys
that
it
must
be
a
buffalo
stampede
we
immediately
gave
the
alarm
and
started
for
our
herd
to
get
them
out
of
the
way
of
the
buffalo
but
we
soon
found
that
despite
our
utmost
efforts
we
would
be
unable
to
get
them
out
of
the
way
so
we
came
to
the
conclusion
to
meet
them
with
our
guns
and
try
and
turn
the
buffalo
from
our
direction
if
possible
and
prevent
them
from
going
through
our
herd
accordingly
all
hands
rode
to
meet
the
oncoming
stampede
pouring
volley
after
volley
into
the
almost
solid
mass
of
rushing
beasts
but
they
paid
no
more
attention
to
us
than
they
would
have
paid
to
a
lot
of
boys
with
pea
shooters
on
they
came
a
maddened
plunging
snorting
bellowing
mass
of
horns
and
hoofs
one
of
our
companions
a
young
fellow
by
the
name
of
cal
surcey
who
was
riding
a
young
horse
here
began
to
have
trouble
in
controlling
his
mount
and
before
any
of
us
could
reach
him
his
horse
bolted
right
in
front
of
the
herd
of
buffalo
and
in
a
trice
the
horse
and
rider
went
down
and
the
whole
herd
passed
over
them
after
the
herd
had
passed
we
could
only
find
a
few
scraps
of
poor
cal
clothing
and
the
horse
he
had
been
riding
was
reduced
to
the
size
of
a
jack
rabbit
the
buffalo
went
through
our
herd
killing
five
head
and
crippling
many
others
and
scattering
them
all
over
the
plain
this
was
the
year
that
the
great
buffalo
slaughter
commenced
and
such
stampedes
were
common
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
as
soon
as
we
got
out
of
one
trouble
we
got
into
another
on
this
trip
but
we
did
not
get
discouraged
but
only
wondered
what
would
happen
next
we
did
not
care
much
for
ourselves
as
we
were
always
ready
and
in
most
cases
anxious
for
a
brush
with
the
indians
or
for
the
other
dangers
of
the
trail
as
they
only
went
to
relieve
the
dull
monotony
of
life
behind
the
herd
but
these
cattle
were
entrusted
to
our
care
and
every
one
represented
money
good
hard
cash
so
we
did
not
relish
in
the
least
having
them
stampeded
by
the
indians
or
run
over
by
the
buffaloes
if
casualties
kept
up
at
this
rate
there
would
not
be
very
many
cattle
to
deliver
in
wyoming
by
the
time
we
got
there
after
the
buffalo
stampede
we
rounded
up
our
scattered
herd
and
went
into
camp
for
a
couple
of
days
rest
before
proceeding
on
our
journey
north
the
tragic
death
of
cal
surcey
had
a
very
depressing
effect
on
all
of
us
as
he
was
a
boy
well
liked
by
us
all
and
it
was
hard
to
think
that
we
could
not
even
give
him
a
christian
burial
we
left
his
remains
trampled
into
the
dust
of
the
prairie
and
his
fate
caused
even
the
most
hardened
of
us
to
shudder
as
we
contemplated
it
after
getting
fairly
rested
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
north
and
were
soon
out
of
the
indian
territory
though
we
often
met
small
bands
of
roving
bucks
but
aside
from
exchanging
a
few
shots
at
each
other
they
caused
us
no
trouble
we
crossed
kansas
and
nebraska
and
reached
the
end
of
our
long
journey
without
further
incident
worthy
of
note
and
we
delivered
our
herd
only
five
head
short
which
was
not
bad
considering
the
distance
we
had
travelled
and
the
events
that
had
happened
it
was
a
wonder
that
we
had
been
able
to
get
through
with
half
of
our
herd
or
men
consequently
it
was
with
genuine
relief
that
we
turned
the
cattle
over
to
their
new
owners
and
received
our
receipt
therefor
we
remained
at
the
mitchell
ranch
in
wyoming
several
days
fraternizing
with
our
northern
brothers
swapping
yarns
and
having
a
good
time
generally
on
the
return
journey
to
arizona
we
were
of
course
able
to
make
better
time
and
we
returned
more
direct
by
way
of
colorado
and
utah
taking
note
of
the
cattle
trails
and
the
country
over
which
we
passed
in
that
way
we
secured
valuable
information
of
the
trails
and
the
country
that
stood
us
in
good
stead
in
future
trips
north
arriving
home
at
the
pete
gallinger
ranch
in
arizona
we
became
the
heroes
of
the
range
and
we
received
unstinted
praise
from
our
boss
but
the
loss
of
cal
surcey
was
universally
regretted
illustration
tragic
death
of
cal
surcey
we
were
relieved
of
all
duty
until
we
got
thoroughly
rested
up
while
our
horses
had
the
best
the
ranch
afforded
but
at
a
large
cattle
ranch
there
is
always
something
doing
and
it
was
not
long
before
we
were
again
in
the
saddle
and
preparing
for
another
trip
on
the
trail
to
the
cow
boy
accustomed
to
riding
long
distances
life
in
the
saddle
ceases
to
be
tiresome
it
is
only
the
dull
monotony
of
following
a
large
herd
of
cattle
on
the
trail
day
after
day
that
tires
the
rider
and
makes
him
long
for
something
to
turn
up
in
the
way
of
excitement
it
does
not
matter
what
it
is
just
so
it
is
excitement
of
some
kind
this
the
cow
boy
finds
in
riding
shooting
roping
and
such
sports
when
he
is
not
engaged
in
fighting
indians
or
protecting
his
herds
from
the
organized
bands
of
white
cattle
thieves
that
infested
the
cattle
country
in
those
days
it
was
about
this
time
that
i
hired
to
bill
montgomery
for
a
time
to
assist
in
taking
a
band
of
nine
hundred
head
of
horses
to
dodge
city
the
journey
out
was
without
incident
on
arriving
at
dodge
city
we
sold
the
horses
for
a
good
price
returning
to
the
old
ranch
in
arizona
by
the
way
of
the
old
lone
and
lonesome
dodge
city
trail
while
en
route
home
on
this
trail
we
had
a
sharp
fight
with
the
indians
when
i
saw
them
coming
i
shouted
to
my
companions
we
will
battle
them
to
hell
soon
we
heard
their
yells
as
they
charged
us
at
full
speed
we
met
them
with
a
hot
fire
from
our
winchesters
but
as
they
were
in
such
large
numbers
we
saw
that
we
could
not
stop
them
that
way
and
it
soon
developed
into
a
hand
to
hand
fight
my
saddle
horse
was
shot
from
under
me
at
about
the
same
time
my
partner
james
holley
was
killed
shot
through
the
heart
i
caught
holley
horse
and
continued
the
fight
until
it
became
evident
that
the
indians
were
too
much
for
us
then
it
became
a
question
of
running
or
being
scalped
we
thought
it
best
to
run
as
we
did
not
think
we
could
very
well
spare
any
hair
at
that
particular
time
any
way
we
mostly
preferred
to
have
our
hair
cut
in
the
regular
way
by
a
competent
barber
not
that
the
indians
would
charge
us
too
much
they
would
have
probably
done
the
job
for
nothing
but
we
did
want
to
trouble
them
and
we
did
not
grudge
the
price
of
a
hair
cut
any
way
so
we
put
spurs
to
our
horses
and
they
soon
carried
us
out
of
danger
nearly
every
one
of
us
were
wounded
in
this
fight
but
holley
was
the
only
man
killed
on
our
side
though
a
few
of
the
indians
were
made
better
as
the
result
of
it
we
heard
afterwards
that
holley
was
scalped
and
his
body
filled
with
arrows
by
the
red
devils
this
was
only
one
of
the
many
similar
fights
we
were
constantly
having
with
the
indians
and
the
cattle
thieves
of
that
part
of
the
country
they
were
so
common
that
it
was
not
considered
worth
mentioning
except
when
we
lost
a
man
as
on
this
occasion
this
was
the
only
trouble
we
had
on
this
trip
of
any
importance
and
we
soon
arrived
at
the
montgomery
ranch
in
texas
where
after
a
few
days
rest
with
the
boys
resting
up
i
made
tracks
in
the
direction
of
my
own
crib
in
arizona
chapter
x
we
make
a
trip
to
nebraska
the
hole
in
the
wall
country
a
little
shooting
scrape
cattle
on
the
trail
and
the
way
to
handle
them
a
bit
of
moralization
the
ranch
boss
voice
rang
out
sharply
but
kindly
as
he
entered
our
quarters
where
we
were
engaged
in
all
sorts
of
occupations
some
of
the
boys
playing
cards
others
smoking
and
swapping
stories
while
those
more
industrious
were
diligently
engaged
in
cleaning
their
i
glanced
up
from
my
long
barreled
rifle
i
was
just
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
wondering
what
was
up
now
the
boss
informed
us
that
we
were
to
take
another
herd
of
cattle
north
away
up
in
the
northwestern
part
of
nebraska
and
that
all
of
us
who
were
on
the
last
trip
had
been
selected
for
the
duty
again
this
trip
this
announcement
was
met
with
exclamations
of
approval
from
the
boys
who
had
now
got
thoroughly
rested
up
and
were
anxious
for
regular
duty
again
since
our
return
from
wyoming
we
had
not
been
doing
much
but
taking
it
easy
with
occasional
range
riding
and
were
becoming
rusty
in
consequence
we
were
to
start
on
our
second
journey
north
this
season
as
soon
as
possible
so
we
lost
no
time
in
getting
ready
we
were
to
take
the
same
size
herd
as
before
it
did
not
take
us
long
to
round
the
herd
up
and
the
second
day
from
the
time
we
received
the
order
we
were
off
our
route
was
different
this
time
starting
from
the
home
ranch
in
arizona
we
went
by
way
of
new
mexico
colorado
and
into
nebraska
by
way
of
the
platte
river
which
we
crossed
near
where
the
forks
of
the
north
and
south
platte
unite
it
was
now
late
in
the
season
and
we
had
to
hurry
in
order
to
get
through
in
good
weather
therefore
we
put
the
cattle
to
the
limit
of
their
traveling
powers
beef
cattle
that
is
four
year
old
long
horns
differ
greatly
from
other
cattle
in
their
travel
the
first
day
after
being
put
out
on
the
trail
they
will
travel
miles
without
any
trouble
then
as
the
pace
begins
to
tell
on
them
they
fall
back
to
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
a
day
and
there
also
seems
to
be
an
understanding
among
the
cattle
themselves
that
each
must
take
a
turn
at
leading
the
herd
those
that
start
in
the
lead
in
the
morning
will
be
away
back
in
the
center
of
the
herd
at
noon
and
those
that
started
in
the
center
are
now
leading
this
they
keep
up
until
all
have
had
their
turn
at
leading
and
as
a
rule
if
they
are
not
scared
by
something
they
will
stay
pretty
well
bunched
we
allowed
the
herd
to
graze
and
rest
during
the
night
only
traveling
during
the
day
as
a
herd
of
cattle
should
never
be
moved
off
their
grazing
ground
until
the
dew
is
off
the
grass
because
their
feet
are
made
soft
by
the
wet
grass
and
if
they
are
moved
onto
the
hard
trail
while
in
that
condition
sore
heels
are
sure
to
result
and
a
steer
with
sore
heels
can
not
travel
and
will
have
to
be
left
behind
on
the
trail
or
the
herd
held
until
those
affected
have
recovered
our
saddle
horses
travel
several
times
the
distance
that
a
herd
of
cattle
does
on
the
trail
as
it
is
necessary
to
ride
from
one
end
of
the
herd
to
the
other
to
keep
them
in
line
and
headed
in
the
right
direction
this
work
is
hard
on
the
horses
but
that
is
always
provided
for
by
having
a
small
herd
of
horses
along
under
the
charge
of
a
horse
rustler
as
we
called
him
and
any
of
the
boys
could
change
his
tired
horse
for
a
fresh
one
at
any
time
he
chose
but
he
would
have
no
one
to
help
him
make
the
change
he
would
have
to
rope
throw
saddle
and
bridle
the
horse
himself
without
any
assistance
whatever
from
his
companions
and
this
was
no
easy
matter
as
most
of
the
horses
were
wild
texas
mustangs
and
had
never
had
the
saddle
on
more
than
once
or
twice
and
so
as
often
happened
the
cow
boy
would
be
led
a
hard
life
before
he
finally
made
the
change
of
mounts
on
such
occasions
he
always
received
the
unwelcome
and
unasked
advice
of
the
other
boys
but
as
most
of
the
boys
were
expert
at
that
business
there
was
slight
chance
for
railing
and
chaff
but
if
for
any
reason
he
should
get
the
laugh
from
his
companions
he
always
took
it
in
the
same
spirit
in
which
it
was
given
only
waiting
his
chance
to
get
even
and
such
a
chance
was
not
long
in
coming
this
particular
herd
acted
very
well
and
gave
us
no
trouble
to
speak
of
our
route
lay
over
the
old
hays
and
elsworth
trail
one
of
the
best
known
cattle
trails
in
the
west
then
by
way
of
olga
nebraska
at
that
time
a
very
small
and
also
a
very
tough
place
it
was
a
rendezvous
of
the
tough
element
and
the
bad
men
of
the
cow
country
there
were
a
large
number
of
cow
boys
there
from
the
surrounding
ranges
and
the
place
looked
very
enticing
to
our
tired
and
thirsty
crowd
but
we
had
our
herd
to
look
after
and
deliver
so
we
could
not
stop
but
pushed
on
north
crossing
the
platte
river
then
up
the
trail
that
led
by
the
hole
in
the
wall
country
near
which
place
we
went
into
camp
then
as
now
this
hole
in
the
wall
country
was
the
refuge
of
the
train
robbers
cattle
thieves
and
bandits
of
the
western
country
and
when
we
arrived
the
place
was
unusually
full
of
them
and
it
was
not
long
before
trouble
was
brewing
between
our
men
and
the
natives
which
culminated
in
one
of
our
men
shooting
and
killing
one
of
the
bad
men
of
the
hole
fearing
more
trouble
and
not
being
in
the
best
possible
shape
to
meet
it
burdened
as
we
were
with
five
hundred
head
of
cattle
we
broke
camp
at
once
and
proceeded
on
our
journey
north
we
arrived
at
the
ranch
where
our
herd
were
to
be
delivered
without
further
incident
and
with
all
our
cattle
intact
and
after
turning
the
herd
over
to
their
new
owners
and
spending
several
days
in
getting
acquainted
with
our
northern
neighbors
the
nebraska
cowboys
whom
we
found
hot
numbers
and
a
jolly
all
round
crowd
of
cattle
men
we
left
for
arizona
on
the
return
journey
by
way
of
wyoming
colorado
and
new
mexico
arriving
home
in
good
shape
late
in
the
fall
without
further
incident
and
were
soon
engaged
in
range
riding
over
our
own
ranges
again
and
getting
everything
in
shape
for
the
winter
but
we
had
to
be
out
on
the
range
off
and
on
all
winter
then
in
the
spring
came
the
usual
round
ups
cuttings
and
brandings
during
which
time
all
our
men
were
needed
at
the
home
ranch
i
had
long
since
developed
into
a
first
class
cow
boy
and
besides
being
chief
brand
reader
in
arizona
and
the
pan
handle
country
my
expertness
in
riding
roping
and
in
the
general
routine
of
the
cow
boy
life
including
my
wide
knowledge
of
the
surrounding
country
gained
in
many
long
trips
with
herds
of
cattle
and
horses
made
my
services
in
great
demand
and
my
wages
increased
accordingly
to
see
me
now
you
would
not
recognize
the
bronze
hardened
dare
devil
cow
boy
the
slave
boy
who
a
few
years
ago
hunted
rabbits
in
his
shirt
tail
on
the
old
plantation
in
tennessee
or
the
tenderfoot
who
shrank
shaking
all
over
at
the
sight
of
a
band
of
painted
indians
i
had
long
since
felt
the
hot
sting
of
the
leaden
bullet
as
it
plowed
its
way
through
some
portion
of
my
anatomy
likewise
i
had
lost
all
sense
of
fear
and
while
i
was
not
the
wild
blood
thirsty
savage
and
all
around
bad
man
many
writers
have
pictured
me
in
their
romances
yet
i
was
wild
reckless
and
free
afraid
of
nothing
that
is
nothing
that
i
ever
saw
with
a
wide
knowledge
of
the
cattle
country
and
the
cattle
business
and
of
my
guns
with
which
i
was
getting
better
acquainted
with
every
day
and
not
above
taking
my
whiskey
straight
or
returning
bullet
for
bullet
in
a
scrimmage
i
always
had
been
reckless
as
evidenced
by
my
riding
of
black
highwayman
on
the
old
home
plantation
and
i
never
lost
courage
or
my
nerve
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
always
cool
observant
and
ready
for
what
might
turn
up
made
me
liked
and
respected
by
my
employers
and
those
of
the
cattle
kings
of
the
western
country
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
meet
and
know
on
our
own
ranch
among
my
own
companions
my
position
was
as
high
as
a
king
enjoying
the
trust
and
confidence
of
my
employers
and
the
homage
of
the
men
many
of
whom
were
indebted
to
me
on
occasions
when
my
long
rope
or
ever
ready
colt
pistol
had
saved
them
from
serious
injury
or
death
but
i
thought
nothing
of
those
things
then
my
only
ambition
was
to
learn
the
business
and
excel
in
all
things
connected
with
the
cow
boy
life
that
i
was
leading
and
for
which
i
had
genuine
liking
mounted
on
my
favorite
horse
my
long
horsehide
lariat
near
my
hand
and
my
trusty
guns
in
my
belt
and
the
broad
plains
stretching
away
for
miles
and
miles
every
foot
of
which
i
was
familiar
with
i
felt
i
could
defy
the
world
what
man
with
the
fire
of
life
and
youth
and
health
in
his
veins
could
not
rejoice
in
such
a
life
the
fall
and
winter
of
passed
on
the
arizona
ranch
without
any
unusual
occurrence
the
cattle
wintered
well
and
prospects
were
bright
for
the
coming
year
in
the
early
spring
we
again
began
preparing
for
the
big
round
up
the
brandings
and
the
cuttings
there
had
been
hundreds
of
calves
and
colts
added
to
the
vast
herds
these
all
had
to
be
cut
out
and
branded
while
all
the
cattle
that
had
strayed
during
the
winter
had
to
be
rounded
up
and
accounted
for
this
work
kept
us
in
the
saddle
the
greater
part
of
the
time
sometimes
we
would
be
absent
for
days
and
weeks
at
a
time
on
the
trail
of
a
bunch
of
strayed
cattle
on
these
trips
we
often
encountered
big
herds
of
buffalo
and
these
supplied
us
with
meat
and
such
meat
a
buffalo
steak
fresh
from
a
still
quivering
buffalo
broiled
over
coals
is
a
dish
fit
for
the
gods
coming
back
from
one
of
these
trips
after
strays
early
in
we
were
notified
to
get
ready
to
take
a
herd
of
five
hundred
head
of
horses
up
in
south
dakota
the
trip
was
a
long
one
but
horses
can
travel
much
faster
than
cattle
and
on
the
whole
are
much
easier
to
handle
on
the
trails
we
were
all
happy
at
the
prospect
of
the
trip
and
were
not
long
in
getting
ready
and
getting
the
horses
started
out
on
the
trail
we
took
them
by
way
of
new
mexico
colorado
and
nebraska
they
gave
us
very
little
trouble
on
the
way
up
and
we
reached
our
destination
and
delivered
them
without
incident
worthy
of
note
returning
by
way
of
wyoming
colorado
and
new
mexico
on
starting
out
on
the
return
journey
we
came
down
pold
creek
and
stopped
at
the
old
log
saloon
to
get
a
drink
that
being
the
first
place
where
we
could
get
any
whiskey
here
in
moving
around
among
the
large
number
of
cow
boys
and
tough
characters
generally
another
fuss
was
started
between
our
men
and
some
cattle
rustlers
resulting
in
some
shooting
but
fortunately
without
serious
consequences
as
we
were
not
looking
for
trouble
and
not
wishing
to
kill
any
one
we
left
at
once
for
home
it
was
our
policy
to
always
avoid
trouble
if
possible
while
on
these
trips
but
to
always
defend
ourselves
and
our
rights
against
all
comers
be
they
white
men
or
indians
and
then
it
would
look
bad
for
us
to
have
to
report
the
loss
of
a
man
or
so
in
a
saloon
fight
when
we
were
sent
out
to
attend
to
business
for
that
reason
we
did
not
stop
to
give
an
exhibition
of
our
fighting
qualities
although
we
were
very
anxious
to
have
matters
out
with
them
we
arrived
home
safely
with
all
well
and
in
time
to
assist
in
the
round
ups
and
the
other
ranch
work
in
which
we
were
needed

a
buffalo
hunt
i
lose
my
lariat
and
saddle
i
order
a
drink
for
myself
and
my
horse
a
close
place
in
old
mexico
when
there
was
not
much
doing
around
the
ranch
we
boys
would
get
up
a
buffalo
hunt
buffaloes
were
plentiful
in
those
days
and
one
did
not
have
to
ride
far
before
striking
a
herd
going
out
on
the
open
plain
we
were
not
long
in
sighting
a
herd
peacefully
grazing
on
the
luxuriant
grass
and
it
would
have
been
an
easy
task
to
shoot
them
but
that
was
not
our
idea
of
sport
in
the
first
place
it
was
too
easy
then
to
shoot
them
would
rob
the
hunt
of
all
element
of
danger
and
excitement
for
that
reason
we
prepared
to
rope
them
and
then
dispatch
them
with
the
knife
or
revolver
as
soon
as
the
herd
caught
sight
of
us
they
promptly
proceeded
to
stampede
and
were
off
like
the
wind
we
all
had
pretty
good
mounts
and
we
started
in
pursuit
it
is
a
grand
sight
to
see
a
large
herd
of
several
thousand
buffalo
on
a
stampede
all
running
with
their
heads
down
and
their
tongues
hanging
out
like
a
yard
of
red
flannel
snorting
and
bellowing
they
crowd
along
shaking
the
ground
for
yards
around
we
soon
reached
the
rear
of
the
herd
and
began
operations
i
had
roped
and
dispatched
several
when
my
attention
was
attracted
by
a
magnificent
bull
buffalo
which
i
made
up
my
mind
to
get
running
free
behind
the
herd
my
buffalo
soon
came
within
range
and
my
rope
settled
squarely
over
his
horns
and
my
horse
braced
himself
for
the
strain
but
the
bull
proved
too
much
for
us
my
horse
was
knocked
down
the
saddle
snatched
from
under
me
and
off
my
horse
back
and
my
neck
nearly
broken
as
i
struck
the
hardest
spot
in
that
part
of
texas
after
i
got
through
counting
the
stars
not
to
mention
the
moons
that
i
could
see
quite
plainly
i
jumped
to
my
feet
and
after
assuring
myself
that
i
was
all
there
i
looked
for
my
horse
he
was
close
by
just
getting
up
while
in
the
distance
and
fast
growing
more
distant
each
moment
was
my
favorite
saddle
flying
in
the
breeze
hanging
to
the
head
of
the
infuriated
buffalo
now
i
did
not
think
i
could
very
well
lose
that
saddle
so
i
sprang
on
my
horse
bare
back
and
started
in
pursuit
my
horse
could
run
like
a
deer
and
his
hard
fall
did
not
seem
to
affect
him
much
so
it
did
not
take
us
long
to
overtake
the
plunging
herd
running
my
horse
close
up
by
the
side
of
the
thief
who
stole
my
saddle
i
placed
the
muzzle
of
my
close
against
his
side
and
right
there
i
took
charge
of
buffalo
and
my
outfit
it
was
no
trouble
to
get
all
the
buffalo
meat
we
wanted
in
those
days
all
that
was
necessary
was
to
ride
out
on
the
prairie
and
knock
them
over
with
a
bullet
a
feat
that
any
cow
boy
can
accomplish
without
useless
waste
of
ammunition
and
a
running
buffalo
furnishes
perhaps
the
best
kind
of
a
moving
target
for
practice
shooting
and
the
man
that
can
drop
his
buffalo
at
two
hundred
yards
the
first
shot
can
hit
pretty
much
anything
he
shoots
at
i
never
missed
anything
i
shot
at
within
this
distance
and
many
a
time
when
i
thought
the
distance
of
an
object
was
too
great
the
boys
have
encouraged
me
by
saying
shoot
you
never
miss
and
as
much
to
my
surprise
as
theirs
my
old
stand
by
placed
the
bullet
where
i
aimed
i
early
in
my
career
recognized
the
fact
that
a
cow
boy
must
know
how
to
use
his
guns
and
therefore
i
never
lost
an
opportunity
to
improve
my
shooting
abilities
until
i
was
able
to
hit
anything
within
range
of
my
or
my
winchester
this
ability
has
times
without
number
proved
of
incalculable
value
to
me
when
in
tight
places
it
has
often
saved
the
life
of
myself
and
companions
and
so
by
constant
practice
i
soon
became
known
as
the
best
shot
in
the
arizona
and
pan
handle
country
after
the
buffalo
hunt
we
were
sent
down
in
old
mexico
to
get
a
herd
of
horses
that
our
boss
had
bought
from
the
mexicans
in
the
southwestern
part
of
old
mexico
we
made
the
journey
out
all
right
without
special
incident
but
after
we
had
got
the
horses
out
on
the
trail
headed
north
i
was
possessed
with
a
desire
to
show
off
and
i
thought
surprise
the
staid
old
greasers
on
whom
we
of
the
northern
cattle
country
looked
with
contempt
so
accordingly
i
left
the
boys
to
continue
with
the
herd
while
i
made
for
the
nearest
saloon
which
happened
to
be
located
in
one
of
the
low
mud
houses
of
that
country
with
a
wide
door
and
clay
floor
as
the
door
was
standing
open
and
looked
so
inviting
i
did
not
want
to
go
to
the
trouble
of
dismounting
so
urging
my
horse
forward
i
rode
in
the
saloon
first
however
scattering
with
a
few
random
shots
the
respectable
sized
crowd
of
dirty
mexicans
hanging
around
as
i
was
in
no
humor
to
pay
for
the
drinks
for
such
a
motley
gathering
riding
up
to
the
bar
i
ordered
keller
for
myself
and
a
generous
measure
of
pulky
for
my
horse
both
popular
mexican
drinks
illustration
i
lose
my
lariat
and
saddle
i
hit
the
hardest
spot
in
that
part
of
texas
the
fat
wobbling
greaser
who
was
behind
the
bar
looked
scared
but
he
proceeded
to
serve
us
with
as
much
grace
as
he
could
command
my
colt
which
i
proceeded
to
reload
acting
as
a
persuader
hearing
a
commotion
outside
i
realized
that
i
was
surrounded
the
crowd
of
mexican
bums
had
not
appreciated
my
kindly
greeting
as
i
rode
up
and
it
seems
did
not
take
kindly
to
being
scattered
by
bullets
and
not
realizing
that
i
could
have
killed
them
all
just
as
easy
as
i
scattered
them
and
seeing
there
was
but
two
of
us
i
and
my
horse
they
had
summoned
sufficient
courage
to
come
back
and
seek
revenge
there
was
a
good
sized
crowd
of
them
every
one
with
some
kind
of
shooting
iron
and
i
saw
at
once
that
they
meant
business
i
hated
to
have
to
hurt
some
of
them
but
i
could
see
i
would
have
to
or
be
taken
myself
and
perhaps
strung
up
to
ornament
a
telegraph
pole
this
pleasant
experience
i
had
no
especial
wish
to
try
so
putting
spurs
to
my
horse
i
dashed
out
of
the
saloon
then
knocking
a
man
over
with
every
bullet
from
my
colts
i
cut
for
the
open
country
followed
by
several
volleys
from
the
angry
mexicans
pop
guns
illustration
i
take
charge
of
my
buffalo
and
outfit
the
only
harm
their
bullets
did
however
was
to
wound
my
horse
in
the
hip
not
seriously
however
and
he
carried
me
quickly
out
of
range
i
expected
to
be
pursued
however
as
i
had
no
doubt
i
had
done
for
some
of
those
whom
i
knocked
over
so
made
straight
for
the
rio
grande
river
riding
day
and
night
until
i
sighted
that
welcome
stream
and
on
the
other
side
i
knew
i
was
safe
crossing
the
rio
grande
and
entering
texas
at
the
eagle
pass
i
rode
straight
to
the
old
home
ranch
where
i
stayed
resting
up
until
the
boys
got
the
horses
out
of
mexico
into
texas
then
i
joined
them
and
assisted
in
driving
the
horses
into
the
ranch
i
congratulated
myself
that
i
escaped
so
easily
and
with
such
little
damage
it
was
certainly
a
close
place
but
i
have
been
in
even
closer
places
numbers
of
times
and
always
managed
to
escape
either
through
trick
the
fleetness
of
my
horse
or
my
shooting
and
sometimes
through
all
combined
at
this
time
i
was
known
all
over
the
cattle
country
as
red
river
dick
the
name
given
to
me
by
the
boss
of
the
duval
outfit
when
i
first
joined
the
cow
boys
at
dodge
city
kansas
and
many
of
the
cattle
kings
of
the
west
as
well
as
the
indians
and
scores
of
bad
men
all
over
the
western
country
have
at
some
time
or
other
had
good
reason
to
remember
the
name
of
red
river
dick
this
was
in
it
was
not
till
the
next
year
that
i
won
the
name
of
deadwood
dick
a
name
i
made
even
better
known
than
red
river
dick
and
a
name
i
was
proud
to
carry
and
defend
if
necessary
with
my
life
this
season
we
made
several
trips
north
the
horses
we
brought
up
from
texas
now
had
to
be
driven
to
old
man
keith
in
nebraska
on
the
north
platte
river
on
this
trip
we
had
no
trouble
to
speak
of
several
bands
of
indians
showed
up
at
different
times
but
a
shot
or
so
from
one
of
the
boys
would
send
them
scurrying
off
at
full
speed
without
stopping
to
sample
further
our
fighting
abilities
this
was
in
some
ways
disappointing
to
us
as
we
were
spoiling
for
a
fight
or
excitement
of
some
kind
however
nothing
turned
up
so
after
delivering
the
horses
to
their
new
owners
we
made
tracks
for
home
again
it
was
the
same
round
of
duties
season
after
season
but
all
our
trips
on
the
trail
were
not
by
any
means
alike
we
were
continually
visiting
new
country
and
new
scenes
traveling
over
trails
new
to
us
but
old
in
history
many
of
these
old
trails
are
now
famous
in
history
illustration
i
order
a
drink
for
myself
and
horse
each
trip
gave
us
new
experiences
and
traveling
so
much
as
we
were
there
were
few
outfits
in
the
cattle
country
that
knew
the
trails
and
the
country
as
we
did
and
we
were
continually
adding
to
this
knowledge
and
experience
after
returning
from
old
man
keith
in
nebraska
we
had
to
take
the
trail
again
with
a
herd
of
cattle
for
the
spencer
brothers
whose
ranch
was
located
just
north
of
the
red
light
about
miles
north
of
the
bad
lands
in
south
dakota
this
was
one
of
the
largest
cattle
ranches
in
the
west
their
brand
was
known
as
the
r
box
circle
brand
there
we
remained
for
some
time
adding
to
our
knowledge
of
the
cattle
business
such
things
as
can
only
be
learned
at
a
large
cattle
ranch
on
our
way
home
we
passed
through
laramie
wyoming
as
fate
would
have
it
we
arrived
at
laramie
city
on
july
just
as
the
notorious
jack
watkins
escaped
from
the
albany
county
jail
and
the
excitement
in
the
town
was
at
fever
heat
jack
watkins
who
was
probably
the
most
desperate
criminal
that
was
ever
placed
behind
prison
bars
had
been
arrested
and
placed
in
close
confinement
as
the
officers
of
the
western
states
had
long
tried
to
effect
his
capture
and
they
did
not
want
to
take
any
chances
of
losing
him
now
they
had
him
but
for
all
their
caution
he
had
escaped
shooting
deputy
sheriff
lawrence
in
the
leg
crippling
him
for
life
brophy
was
at
that
time
sheriff
the
officers
noting
our
arrival
at
such
time
at
once
ordered
us
out
of
the
city
as
they
suspected
we
knew
something
about
the
outbreak
we
protested
our
innocence
of
any
knowledge
of
the
trouble
but
appearances
were
against
us
so
we
had
to
leave
going
direct
to
cheyenne
wyoming
here
we
disposed
of
a
small
band
of
horses
our
boss
had
along
and
which
we
did
not
wish
to
take
back
home
with
us
they
were
sold
to
the
swarn
brothers
at
a
good
price
we
remained
in
cheyenne
until
the
of
july
when
we
left
for
texas
arriving
at
the
old
pali
dora
range
ranch
on
the
of
august
we
had
no
more
than
got
rested
up
before
we
were
again
called
out
on
active
duty
the
many
large
cattle
owners
of
the
panhandle
country
had
got
together
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
wild
mustang
horses
large
bands
of
which
were
running
wild
over
the
arizona
and
texas
plains
would
make
good
cattle
horses
and
to
that
end
a
plan
of
campaign
was
arranged
whereby
they
could
be
captured
and
broken
in
and
put
to
some
use
instead
of
causing
damage
to
the
range

it
was
a
bright
clear
morning
in
september
as
we
were
all
gathered
at
the
old
home
ranch
prepared
to
start
on
the
great
mustang
hunt
there
was
one
of
the
best
men
from
each
of
the
big
cattle
ranges
in
the
panhandle
and
arizona
country
making
twenty
of
the
best
range
riders
ever
assembled
together
for
a
single
purpose
while
we
were
mounted
on
the
best
and
fastest
horses
the
texas
and
arizona
cattle
country
could
produce
while
a
horse
rustler
had
left
four
days
before
with
twenty
more
equally
as
good
horses
giving
each
of
us
two
horses
apiece
we
carried
with
us
four
days
rations
consisting
of
dried
beef
crackers
potatoes
coffee
we
had
no
sugar
the
mess
wagon
well
stocked
with
provisions
for
a
two
months
trip
had
also
left
four
days
before
for
a
place
in
the
wild
horse
district
where
we
knew
the
mustangs
were
to
be
found
many
of
the
cattle
men
of
texas
and
arizona
were
present
to
see
us
off
and
the
boss
gave
us
a
little
talk
on
what
was
expected
of
us
and
said
among
other
things
we
were
twenty
of
the
best
and
gamest
cow
boys
who
ever
roamed
the
western
plains
and
that
he
knew
we
would
make
good
on
hearing
these
words
we
one
and
all
resolved
to
do
our
best
and
swinging
into
the
saddle
we
emptied
our
guns
as
a
parting
salutation
and
started
on
a
dead
run
across
the
plains
towards
the
scene
of
our
duty
after
a
hard
ride
of
ten
days
we
sighted
a
band
of
about
mustangs
we
at
once
proceeded
to
run
them
down
it
was
decided
that
twenty
of
us
should
surround
the
herd
in
a
large
circle
ten
or
fifteen
miles
across
which
would
leave
a
space
of
several
miles
between
each
rider
but
not
of
a
greater
distance
than
he
could
easily
cover
when
he
saw
the
band
coming
his
way
or
heard
our
signals
the
horse
rustler
was
to
keep
the
extra
horses
at
a
place
where
they
would
be
safe
and
at
the
same
time
handy
to
the
riders
our
plans
completed
each
rider
made
preparations
to
start
for
his
station
but
here
another
difficulty
arose
we
had
not
yet
seen
anything
of
our
cook
and
mess
wagon
it
had
not
arrived
at
the
place
agreed
upon
although
it
had
had
ample
time
to
do
so
our
provisions
which
we
carried
were
quite
low
so
after
waiting
as
long
as
we
could
and
the
mess
wagon
failing
to
show
up
we
decided
to
start
the
hunt
and
take
our
chances
on
grub
from
what
we
could
knock
over
with
our
guns
accordingly
the
boys
all
started
out
for
their
several
stations
after
waiting
a
reasonable
length
of
time
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
reach
their
positions
we
made
for
the
herd
which
as
near
as
we
could
judge
contained
about
of
the
prettiest
horses
it
was
ever
my
pleasure
to
see
the
magnificent
stallion
who
happened
to
be
on
guard
had
no
sooner
seen
us
than
he
gave
the
danger
signal
to
the
herd
who
were
off
like
the
wind
led
by
a
beautiful
snow
white
stallion
to
get
them
going
was
our
only
duty
at
present
and
we
well
knew
the
importance
of
saving
our
saddle
horses
for
the
more
serious
work
before
us
therefore
we
only
walked
our
horses
or
went
on
a
dog
trot
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
for
the
herd
return
the
band
of
wild
horses
would
run
ten
or
fifteen
miles
across
the
prairie
where
they
would
catch
sight
of
the
other
boys
then
off
they
would
go
in
another
direction
only
to
repeat
the
performance
as
they
struck
the
other
side
of
the
circle
in
this
way
they
would
make
from
fifty
to
sixty
miles
to
our
ten
and
we
were
slowly
working
them
down
we
kept
them
going
this
way
day
and
night
not
giving
them
a
rest
or
time
to
eat
after
keeping
them
on
the
go
this
way
for
ten
days
we
were
able
to
get
within
a
mile
of
them
and
could
see
some
of
the
stallions
taking
turns
at
leading
the
herd
while
other
stallions
would
be
in
the
rear
fighting
them
on
in
a
few
days
more
we
were
near
enough
to
begin
shooting
the
stallions
out
of
the
herd
then
we
could
handle
them
a
great
deal
better
at
this
time
our
want
of
grub
began
to
tell
on
us
our
cook
and
mess
wagon
had
not
showed
up
so
we
had
long
since
given
them
up
as
lost
we
believed
they
had
been
captured
by
the
indians
and
future
events
proved
we
were
right
illustration
the
big
wild
mustang
hunt
we
were
roping
and
riding
them
in
fox
canyon
our
only
food
consisted
of
buffalo
meat
of
which
we
were
able
to
secure
plenty
but
buffalo
meat
for
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
every
day
without
bread
or
salt
is
not
the
most
palatable
bill
of
fare
especially
when
it
is
all
we
had
day
after
day
without
any
prospect
of
a
change
until
we
got
home
but
we
were
game
and
resolved
to
stay
with
our
work
until
it
was
finished
especially
as
we
only
had
twenty
men
and
everyone
was
badly
needed
in
the
work
ahead
of
us
so
we
did
not
think
we
could
spare
a
man
to
return
home
after
grub
so
we
swallowed
our
buffalo
meat
day
after
day
and
kept
the
horses
moving
they
were
now
pretty
well
worked
down
and
we
proceeded
to
work
them
toward
a
place
where
we
could
begin
to
rope
them
there
were
now
only
a
few
stallions
left
in
the
herd
as
we
had
shot
nearly
all
of
them
and
the
others
were
too
tired
to
cause
us
any
trouble
we
had
now
been
out
of
grub
over
three
weeks
except
buffalo
meat
and
such
other
game
as
we
could
bring
down
with
our
guns
our
fears
that
the
cook
and
mess
wagon
had
been
captured
by
the
indians
proved
well
founded
as
we
about
this
time
met
an
outfit
who
had
seen
the
place
where
the
cook
was
killed
they
said
the
surroundings
indicated
that
quite
a
large
band
had
surprised
the
cook
and
driver
but
that
they
had
put
up
a
brave
fight
as
evidenced
by
the
large
number
of
empty
rifle
and
revolver
shells
scattered
around
our
first
impulse
after
hearing
this
was
to
start
in
pursuit
of
the
red
skins
and
get
revenge
but
calmer
judgment
showed
that
such
a
course
would
be
useless
because
the
indians
had
a
couple
of
weeks
start
of
us
and
we
did
not
know
what
tribe
had
committed
the
offense
as
there
were
so
many
indians
in
that
part
of
the
country
and
in
the
indian
territory
and
besides
our
horses
were
in
no
shape
to
chase
indians
so
much
to
our
regret
our
comrades
had
to
go
unrevenged
at
least
for
the
present
but
we
all
swore
to
make
the
indians
pay
dearly
especially
the
guilty
ones
if
it
were
possible
to
discover
who
they
were
we
continued
to
work
the
mustangs
back
and
forth
and
in
thirty
days
from
the
time
we
started
out
we
had
about
sixty
head
hemmed
up
in
yellow
fox
canyon
and
were
roping
and
riding
them
they
were
not
hard
to
handle
as
they
were
so
poor
some
of
them
could
hardly
walk
this
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
as
we
had
kept
them
on
the
go
for
the
past
thirty
days
never
once
giving
them
a
moment
rest
day
or
night
and
in
that
time
they
had
very
little
to
eat
and
no
sleep
after
roping
and
riding
them
all
we
got
them
together
and
headed
for
home
arriving
at
the
ranch
the
mustangs
were
allowed
to
eat
all
they
wanted
and
were
roped
and
ridden
until
they
were
fairly
well
broken
when
they
were
turned
out
with
the
other
ranch
horses
they
proved
good
saddle
horses
but
as
soon
as
they
were
turned
out
with
the
ranch
horses
they
would
start
for
their
old
feeding
grounds
leading
the
other
horses
with
them
we
found
it
impossible
to
thoroughly
domesticate
them
so
for
that
reason
we
gave
them
up
as
a
bad
proposition
and
did
not
attempt
to
capture
any
more
though
at
that
time
thousands
of
wild
mustangs
were
on
the
plains
of
texas
arizona
wyoming
and
in
fact
all
over
the
west
they
were
large
fine
and
as
pretty
a
lot
of
horses
as
one
could
wish
to
see
they
were
seldom
molested
though
once
in
a
while
the
indians
would
make
a
campaign
against
them
and
capture
a
few
but
not
often
as
they
were
so
hard
to
capture
it
was
not
worth
the
trouble
as
it
was
almost
impossible
to
approach
them
nearer
than
two
miles
and
there
was
always
some
stallions
on
the
lookout
while
the
others
grazed
over
the
plains
so
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
surprise
them
at
the
first
sign
of
danger
the
stallion
sentinel
would
give
his
shrill
neigh
of
warning
and
the
herd
were
off
like
the
wind
we
received
unstinted
praise
from
our
employers
for
bringing
to
a
successful
conclusion
the
errand
on
which
we
were
sent
under
such
trying
circumstances
but
now
that
we
were
where
grub
was
plentiful
we
looked
on
our
experience
as
nothing
to
make
a
fuss
over
but
we
deeply
regretted
the
loss
of
our
cook
and
mess
wagon
and
we
resolved
that
if
we
ever
found
the
guilty
parties
to
make
it
rather
warm
for
them
this
we
never
did
neither
did
we
ever
hear
more
of
the
fate
of
the
cook
our
work
so
far
as
trips
on
the
trail
were
concerned
was
over
for
this
season
and
we
could
count
on
a
long
rest
until
spring
as
aside
from
range
riding
and
feeding
there
was
nothing
doing
around
the
home
ranch
but
sometimes
the
range
riding
kept
us
on
the
go
pretty
lively
especially
during
and
after
a
big
storm
which
sometimes
scattered
the
cattle
all
over
the
surrounding
country
and
it
would
take
some
lively
riding
to
get
them
all
together
again
then
the
indians
and
the
white
cattle
thieves
would
make
raids
on
our
herds
running
them
off
in
great
numbers
and
stampeding
the
balance
of
the
herd
this
generally
resulted
in
us
chasing
them
sometimes
for
miles
over
the
prairies
and
we
generally
were
successful
in
recovering
our
cattle
and
punishing
the
cattle
thieves
in
a
manner
that
they
did
not
soon
forget
but
then
again
sometimes
they
would
stampede
the
herd
in
the
night
and
under
the
cover
of
darkness
and
the
excitement
would
manage
to
make
off
with
some
of
the
best
horses
or
the
choicest
cattle
and
by
the
time
we
missed
them
the
thieves
would
have
such
a
start
that
it
was
impossible
to
overtake
them
but
if
they
were
overtaken
vengeance
was
swift
and
sure

quite

afternoon
and
lasted
about
two
hours
that
was
the
last
of
general
custer
and
his
seventh
cavalry
how
i
know
this
so
well
is
because
we
had
orders
from
one
of
the
government
scouts
to
go
in
camp
that
if
we
went
any
farther
north
we
were
liable
to
be
captured
by
the
indians
we
arrived
in
deadwood
in
good
condition
without
having
had
any
trouble
with
the
indians
on
the
way
up
we
turned
our
cattle
over
to
their
new
owners
at
once
then
proceeded
to
take
in
the
town
the
next
morning
july
the
gamblers
and
mining
men
made
up
a
purse
of
for
a
roping
contest
between
the
cow
boys
that
were
then
in
town
and
as
it
was
a
holiday
nearly
all
the
cow
boys
for
miles
around
were
assembled
there
that
day
it
did
not
take
long
to
arrange
the
details
for
the
contest
and
contestants
six
of
them
being
colored
cow
boys
including
myself
our
trail
boss
was
chosen
to
pick
out
the
mustangs
from
a
herd
of
wild
horses
just
off
the
range
and
he
picked
out
twelve
of
the
most
wild
and
vicious
horses
that
he
could
find
illustration
my
first
indian
fight
the
conditions
of
the
contest
were
that
each
of
us
who
were
mounted
was
to
rope
throw
tie
bridle
and
saddle
and
mount
the
particular
horse
picked
for
us
in
the
shortest
time
possible
the
man
accomplishing
the
feat
in
the
quickest
time
to
be
declared
the
winner
it
seems
to
me
that
the
horse
chosen
for
me
was
the
most
vicious
of
the
lot
everything
being
in
readiness
the
cracked
and
we
all
sprang
forward
together
each
of
us
making
for
our
particular
mustang
i
roped
threw
tied
bridled
saddled
and
mounted
my
mustang
in
exactly
nine
minutes
from
the
crack
of
the
gun
the
time
of
the
next
nearest
competitor
was
twelve
minutes
and
thirty
seconds
this
gave
me
the
record
and
championship
of
the
west
which
i
held
up
to
the
time
i
quit
the
business
in
and
my
record
has
never
been
beaten
it
is
worthy
of
passing
remark
that
i
never
had
a
horse
pitch
with
me
so
much
as
that
mustang
but
i
never
stopped
sticking
my
spurs
in
him
and
using
my
quirt
on
his
flanks
until
i
proved
his
master
right
there
the
assembled
crowd
named
me
deadwood
dick
and
proclaimed
me
champion
roper
of
the
western
cattle
country
the
roping
contest
over
a
dispute
arose
over
the
shooting
question
with
the
result
that
a
contest
was
arranged
for
the
afternoon
as
there
happened
to
be
some
of
the
best
shots
with
rifle
and
revolver
in
the
west
present
that
day
among
them
were
stormy
jim
who
claimed
the
championship
powder
horn
bill
who
had
the
reputation
of
never
missing
what
he
shot
at
also
white
head
a
half
breed
who
generally
hit
what
he
shot
at
and
many
other
men
who
knew
how
to
handle
a
rifle
or
the
range
was
measured
off
and
yards
for
the
rifle
and
for
the
colt
at
this
distance
a
bulls
eye
about
the
size
of
an
apple
was
put
up
each
man
was
to
have
shots
at
each
range
with
the
rifle
and
shots
with
the
colts
i
placed
every
one
of
my
shots
with
the
rifle
in
the
bulls
eye
with
ease
all
shots
being
made
from
the
hip
but
with
the
colts
i
missed
it
twice
only
placing
shots
in
the
small
circle
stormy
jim
being
my
nearest
competitor
only
placing
bullets
in
the
bulls
eye
clear
the
rest
being
quite
close
while
with
the
he
placed
bullets
in
the
charmed
circle
this
gave
me
the
championship
of
rifle
and
revolver
shooting
as
well
as
the
roping
contest
and
for
that
day
i
was
the
hero
of
deadwood
and
the
purse
of
which
i
had
won
on
the
roping
contest
went
toward
keeping
things
moving
and
they
did
move
as
only
a
large
crowd
of
cattle
men
can
move
things
this
lasted
for
several
days
when
most
of
the
cattle
men
had
to
return
to
their
respective
ranches
as
it
was
the
busy
season
accordingly
our
outfit
began
to
make
preparations
to
return
to
arizona

in
the
meantime
news
had
reached
us
of
the
custer
massacre
and
the
indignation
and
sorrow
was
universal
as
general
custer
was
personally
known
to
a
large
number
of
the
cattle
men
of
the
west
but
we
could
do
nothing
now
as
the
indians
were
out
in
such
strong
force
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
let
uncle
sam
revenge
the
loss
of
the
general
and
his
brave
command
but
it
is
safe
to
say
not
one
of
us
would
have
hesitated
a
moment
in
taking
the
trail
in
pursuit
of
the
blood

skins
had
the
opportunity
offered

crippled
but
not
conquered

everything
now
being
in
readiness
with
us
we
took
the
trail
homeward
bound
and
left
deadwood
in
a
blaze
of
glory
on
our
way
home
we
visited
the
custer
battle
field
in
the
little
big
horn
basin
there
was
ample
evidence
of
the
desperate
and
bloody
fight
that
had
taken
place
a
few
days
before
we
arrived
home
in
arizona
in
a
short
time
without
further
incident
except
that
on
the
way
back
we
met
and
talked
with
many
of
the
famous
government
scouts
of
that
region
among
them
buffalo
bill
william
cody
yellow
stone
kelley
and
many
others
of
that
day
some
of
whom
are
now
living
while
others
lost
their
lives
in
the
line
of
duty
and
a
finer
or
braver
body
of
men
never
lived
than
these
scouts
of
the
west
it
was
my
pleasure
to
meet
buffalo
bill
often
in
the
early
and
he
was
as
fine
a
man
as
one
could
wish
to
meet
kind

and
brave

the
roping
contest
at
deadwood
buffalo
bill
got
his
name
from
the
fact
that
in
the
early
days
he
was
engaged
in
hunting
buffalo
for
their
hides
and
furnishing
railroad
graders
with
meat
hence
the
name

bill
buffalo
bill

with
many
others
were
at
this
time
serving

miles
the
name
of
deadwood
dick
was
given
to
me
by
the
people
of
deadwood
south
dakota
july
after
i
had
proven
myself
worthy
to
carry
it
and
after
i
had
defeated
all
comers
in
riding
roping
and
shooting
and
i
have
always
carried
the
name
with
honor
since
that
time
we
arrived
at
the
home
ranch
again
on
our
return
from
the
trip
to
deadwood
about
the
middle
of
september
it
taking
us
a
little
over
two
months
to
make
the
return
journey
as
we
stopped
in
cheyenne
for
several
days
and
at
other
places
where
we
always
found
a
hearty
welcome
especially
so
on
this
trip
as
the
news
had
preceded
us
and
i
received
enough
attention
to
have
given
me
the
big
head
but
my
head
had
constantly
refused
to
get
enlarged
again
ever
since
the
time
i
sampled
the
demijohn
in
the
sweet
corn
patch
at
home
arriving
at
home
we
received
a
send
off
from
our
boss
and
our
comrades
of
the
home
ranch
every
man
of
whom
on
hearing
the
news
turned
loose
his
voice
and
his
artillery
in
a
grand
demonstration
in
my
honor
but
they
said
it
was
no
surprise
to
them
as
they
had
long
known
of
my
ability
with
the
rope
rifle
and
colt
but
just
the
same
it
was
gratifying
to
know
i
had
defeated
the
best
men
of
the
west
and
brought
the
record
home
to
the
home
ranch
in
arizona
after
a
good
rest
we
proceeded
to
ride
the
range
again
getting
our
herds
in
good
condition
for
the
winter

hand

chief
the
boys
present
me
with
a
new
outfit
in
the
saddle
and
on
the
trail
again
it
was
a
bright
clear
fall
day
october
that
quite
a
large
number
of
us
boys
started
out
over
the
range
hunting
strays
which
had
been
lost
for
some
time
we
had
scattered
over
the
range
and
i
was
riding
along
alone
when
all
at
once
i
heard
the
well
known
indian
war
whoop
and
noticed
not
far
away
a
large
party
of
indians
making
straight
for
me
they
were
all
well
mounted
and
they
were
in
full
war
paint
which
showed
me
that
they
were
on
the
war
path
and
as
i
was
alone
and
had
no
wish
to
be
scalped
by
them
i
decided
to
run
for
it
so
i
headed
for
yellow
horse
canyon
and
gave
my
horse
the
rein
but
as
i
had
considerable
objection
to
being
chased
by
a
lot
of
painted
savages
without
some
remonstrance
i
turned
in
my
saddle
every
once
in
a
while
and
gave
them
a
shot
by
way
of
greeting
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
a
painted
brave
tumble
from
his
horse
and
go
rolling
in
the
dust
every
time
my
rifle
spoke
and
the
indians
were
by
no
means
idle
all
this
time
as
their
bullets
were
singing
around
me
rather
lively
one
of
them
passing
through
my
thigh
but
it
did
not
amount
to
much
reaching
yellow
horse
canyon
i
had
about
decided
to
stop
and
make
a
stand
when
one
of
their
bullets
caught
me
in
the
leg
passing
clear
through
it
and
then
through
my
horse
killing
him
quickly
falling
behind
him
i
used
his
dead
body
for
a
breast
work
and
stood
the
indians
off
for
a
long
time
as
my
aim
was
so
deadly
and
they
had
lost
so
many
that
they
were
careful
to
keep
out
of
range
but
finally
my
ammunition
gave
out
and
the
indians
were
quick
to
find
this
out
and
they
at
once
closed
in
on
me
but
i
was
by
no
means
subdued
wounded
as
i
was
and
almost
out
of
my
head
and
i
fought
with
my
empty
gun
until
finally
overpowered
when
i
came
to
my
senses
i
was
in
the
indians
camp
my
wounds
had
been
dressed
with
some
kind
of
herbs
the
wound
in
my
breast
just
over
the
heart
was
covered
thickly
with
herbs
and
bound
up
my
nose
had
been
nearly
cut
off
also
one
of
my
fingers
had
been
nearly
cut
off
these
wounds
i
received
when
i
was
fighting
my
captors
with
my
empty
gun
what
caused
them
to
spare
my
life
i
can
not
tell
but
it
was
i
think
partly
because
i
had
proved
myself
a
brave
man
and
all
savages
admire
a
brave
man
and
when
they
captured
a
man
whose
fighting
powers
were
out
of
the
ordinary
they
generally
kept
him
if
possible
as
he
was
needed
in
the
tribe
then
again
yellow
dog
tribe
was
composed
largely
of
half
breeds
and
there
was
a
large
percentage
of
colored
blood
in
the
tribe
and
as
i
was
a
colored
man
they
wanted
to
keep
me
as
they
thought
i
was
too
good
a
man
to
die
be
that
as
it
may
they
dressed
my
wounds
and
gave
me
plenty
to
eat
but
the
only
grub
they
had
was
buffalo
meat
which
they
cooked
over
a
fire
of
buffalo
chips
but
of
this
i
had
all
i
wanted
to
eat
for
the
first
two
days
after
my
capture
they
kept
me
tied
hand
and
foot
at
the
end
of
that
time
they
untied
my
feet
but
kept
my
hands
tied
for
a
couple
of
days
longer
when
i
was
given
my
freedom
but
was
always
closely
watched
by
members
of
the
tribe
three
days
after
my
capture
my
ears
were
pierced
and
i
was
adopted
into
the
tribe
the
operation
of
piercing
my
ears
was
quite
painful
in
the
method
used
as
they
had
a
small
bone
secured
from
a
deer
leg
a
small
thin
bone
rounded
at
the
end
and
as
sharp
as
a
needle
this
they
used
to
make
the
holes
then
strings
made
from
the
tendons
of
a
deer
were
inserted
in
place
of
thread
of
which
the
indians
had
none
then
horn
ear
rings
were
placed
in
my
ears
and
the
same
kind
of
salve
made
from
herbs
which
they
placed
on
my
wounds
was
placed
on
my
ears
and
they
soon
healed
illustration
i
am
adopted
by
yellow
dog
tribe
the
war
dance
the
bullet
holes
in
my
leg
and
breast
also
healed
in
a
surprisingly
short
time
that
was
good
salve
all
right
as
soon
as
i
was
well
enough
i
took
part
in
the
indian
dances
one
kind
or
another
was
in
progress
all
the
time
the
war
dance
and
the
medicine
dance
seemed
the
most
popular
when
in
the
war
dance
the
savages
danced
around
me
in
a
circle
making
gestures
chanting
with
every
now
and
then
a
blood
curdling
yell
always
keeping
time
to
a
sort
of
music
provided
by
stretching
buffalo
skins
tightly
over
a
hoop
when
i
was
well
enough
i
joined
the
dances
and
i
think
i
soon
made
a
good
dancer
the
medicine
dance
varies
from
the
war
dance
only
that
in
the
medicine
dance
the
indians
danced
around
a
boiling
pot
the
pot
being
filled
with
roots
and
water
and
they
dance
around
it
while
it
boils
the
medicine
dance
occurs
about
daylight
i
very
soon
learned
their
ways
and
to
understand
them
though
our
conversation
was
mostly
carried
on
by
means
of
signs
they
soon
gave
me
to
understand
that
i
was
to
marry
the
chief
daughter
promising
me
ponies
to
do
so
and
she
was
literally
thrown
in
my
arms
as
for
the
lady
she
seemed
perfectly
willing
if
not
anxious
to
become
my
bride
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
or
rather
girl
in
fact
all
the
squaws
of
this
tribe
were
good
looking
out
of
the
ordinary
but
i
had
other
notions
just
then
and
did
not
want
to
get
married
under
such
circumstances
but
for
prudence
sake
i
seemed
to
enter
into
their
plans
but
at
the
same
time
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
for
a
chance
to
escape
i
noted
where
the
indians
kept
their
horses
at
night
even
picking
out
the
handsome
and
fleet
indian
pony
which
i
meant
to
use
should
opportunity
occur
and
i
seemed
to
fall
in
with
the
indians
plans
and
seemed
to
them
so
contented
that
they
gave
me
more
and
more
freedom
and
relaxed
the
strict
watch
they
had
kept
on
me
and
finally
in
about
thirty
days
from
the
time
of
my
capture
my
opportunity
arrived
illustration
my
escape
i
ride
a
hundred
miles
in
twelve
hours
without
a
saddle
my
wounds
were
now
nearly
well
and
gave
me
no
trouble
it
was
a
dark
cloudy
night
and
the
indians
grown
careless
in
their
fancied
security
had
relaxed
their
watchfulness
after
they
had
all
thrown
themselves
on
the
ground
and
the
quiet
of
the
camp
proclaimed
them
all
asleep
i
got
up
and
crawling
on
my
hands
and
knees
using
the
greatest
caution
for
fear
of
making
a
noise
i
crawled
about
yards
to
where
the
horses
were
picketed
and
going
to
the
indian
pony
i
had
already
picked
out
i
slipped
the
skin
thong
in
his
mouth
which
the
indians
use
for
a
bridle
one
which
i
had
secured
and
carried
in
my
shirt
for
some
time
for
this
particular
purpose
then
springing
to
his
back
i
made
for
the
open
prairie
in
the
direction
of
the
home
ranch
in
texas
one
hundred
miles
away
all
that
night
i
rode
as
fast
as
my
horse
could
carry
me
and
the
next
morning
twelve
hours
after
i
left
the
indians
camp
i
was
safe
on
the
home
ranch
again
and
my
joy
was
without
bounds
and
such
a
reception
as
i
received
from
the
boys
they
said
they
were
just
one
day
late
and
if
it
had
been
for
a
fight
they
had
with
some
of
the
same
tribe
they
would
have
been
to
my
relief
as
it
was
they
did
not
expect
to
ever
see
me
again
alive
but
that
they
know
that
if
the
indians
did
not
kill
me
and
gave
me
only
half
a
chance
i
would
get
away
from
them
but
now
that
i
was
safe
home
again
nothing
mattered
much
and
nothing
was
too
good
for
me
it
was
a
mystery
to
them
how
i
managed
to
escape
death
with
such
wounds
as
i
had
received
the
marks
of
which
i
will
carry
to
my
grave
and
it
is
as
much
a
mystery
to
me
as
the
bullet
that
struck
me
in
the
breast
just
over
the
heart
passed
clear
through
coming
out
my
back
just
below
the
shoulder
likewise
the
bullet
in
my
leg
passed
clear
through
then
through
my
horse
killing
him
those
indians
are
certainly
wonderful
doctors
and
then
i
am
naturally
tough
as
i
carry
the
marks
of
fourteen
bullet
wounds
on
different
part
of
my
body
most
any
one
of
which
would
be
sufficient
to
kill
an
ordinary
man
but
i
am
not
even
crippled
it
seems
to
me
that
if
ever
a
man
bore
a
charm
i
am
the
man
as
i
have
had
five
horses
shot
from
under
me
and
killed
have
fought
indians
and
mexicans
in
all
sorts
of
situations
and
have
been
in
more
tight
places
than
i
can
number
yet
i
have
always
managed
to
escape
with
only
the
mark
of
a
bullet
or
knife
as
a
reminder
the
fight
with
the
yellow
dog
tribe
is
probably
the
closest
call
i
ever
had
and
as
close
a
call
as
i
ever
want
the
fleet
indian
pony
which
carried
me
to
safety
on
that
memorable
hundred
mile
ride
i
kept
for
about
five
years
i
named
him
the
yellow
dog
chief
and
he
lived
on
the
best
the
ranch
afforded
until
his
death
which
occurred
in
never
having
anything
to
do
except
an
occasional
race
as
he
could
run
like
a
deer
i
thought
too
much
of
him
to
use
him
on
the
trail
and
he
was
the
especial
pet
of
every
one
on
the
home
ranch
and
for
miles
around
i
heard
afterwards
that
the
indians
persued
me
that
night
for
quite
a
distance
but
i
had
too
much
the
start
and
besides
i
had
the
fastest
horse
the
indians
owned
i
have
never
since
met
any
of
my
captors
of
that
time
as
they
knew
better
than
to
venture
in
our
neighborhood
again
my
wound
healed
nicely
thanks
to
the
good
attention
the
indians
gave
me
my
captors
took
everything
of
value
i
had
on
me
when
captured
my
rifle
which
i
especially
prized
for
old
associations
sake
also
my
forty
fives
saddle
and
bridle
in
fact
my
whole
outfit
leaving
me
only
the
few
clothes
i
had
on
at
the
time
my
comrades
did
not
propose
to
let
this
bother
me
long
however
because
they
all
chipped
in
and
bought
me
a
new
outfit
including
the
best
rifle
and
revolvers
that
could
be
secured
and
i
had
my
pick
of
the
ranch
horses
for
another
mount
during
my
short
stay
with
the
indians
i
learned
a
great
deal
about
them
their
ways
of
living
sports
dances
and
mode
of
warfare
which
proved
of
great
benefit
to
me
in
after
years
the
oblong
shields
they
carried
were
made
from
tanned
buffalo
skins
and
so
tough
were
they
made
that
an
arrow
would
not
pierce
them
although
i
have
seen
them
shoot
an
arrow
clean
through
a
buffalo
neither
will
a
bullet
pierce
them
unless
the
ball
hits
the
shield
square
on
otherwise
it
glances
off
all
of
them
were
exceedingly
expert
with
the
bow
and
arrow
and
they
are
proud
of
their
skill
and
are
always
practicing
in
an
effort
to
excel
each
other
this
rivalry
extends
even
to
the
children
who
are
seldom
without
their
bows
and
arrows
they
named
me
buffalo
papoose
and
we
managed
to
make
our
wants
known
by
means
of
signs
as
i
was
not
with
them
a
sufficient
length
of
time
to
learn
their
language
i
learned
from
them
that
i
had
killed
five
of
their
number
and
wounded
three
while
they
were
chasing
me
and
in
the
subsequent
fight
with
my
empty
gun
the
wounded
men
were
hit
in
many
places
but
they
were
brought
around
all
right
the
same
as
i
was
after
my
escape
and
after
i
arrived
home
it
was
some
time
before
i
was
again
called
to
active
duty
as
the
boys
would
not
hear
of
me
doing
anything
resembling
work
until
i
was
thoroughly
well
and
rested
up
but
i
soon
began
to
long
for
my
saddle
and
the
range
and
when
orders
were
received
at
the
ranch
for
head
of
cattle
to
be
delivered
at
dodge
city
kansas
i
insisted
on
taking
the
trail
again
it
was
not
with
any
sense
of
pride
or
in
bravado
that
i
recount
here
the
fate
of
the
men
who
have
fallen
at
my
hand
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
kill
a
man
no
matter
what
the
cause
but
as
i
am
writing
a
true
history
of
my
life
i
can
not
leave
these
facts
out
but
every
man
who
died
at
my
hands
was
either
seeking
my
life
or
died
in
open
warfare
when
it
was
a
case
of
killing
of
being
killed
chapter

on
a
trip
to
dodge

kan
i
rope
one
of
uncle
sam

captured
by
the
soldiers
bat
masterson
to
my
rescue
lost
on
the
prairie
the
buffalo
hunter
cater
my
horse
gets
away
and
leaves
me
alone
on
the
prairie
the
blizzard
frozen
stiff
in
the
spring
of
now
fully
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
very
serious
wounds
i
had
received
at
the
hands
of
the
indians
and
feeling
my
old
self
again
i
joined
the
boys
in
their
first
trip
of
the
season
with
a
herd
of
cattle
for
dodge
city
the
trip
was
uneventful
until
we
reached
our
destination
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
been
in
dodge
city
since
i
had
won
the
name
of
deadwood
dick
and
many
of
the
boys
who
knew
me
when
i
first
joined
the
cow
boys
there
in
were
there
to
greet
me
now
after
our
herd
had
been
delivered
to
their
new
owners
we
started
out
to
properly
celebrate
the
event
and
for
a
space
of
several
days
we
kept
the
old
town
on
the
jump
and
so
when
we
finally
started
for
home
all
of
us
had
more
or
less
of
the
bad
whiskey
of
dodge
city
under
our
belts
and
were
feeling
rather
spirited
and
ready
for
anything
i
probably
had
more
of
the
bad
whiskey
of
dodge
city
than
any
one
and
was
in
consequence
feeling
very
reckless
but
we
had
about
exhausted
our
resources
of
amusement
in
the
town
and
so
were
looking
for
trouble
on
the
trail
home
on
our
way
back
to
texas
our
way
led
past
old
fort
dodge
seeing
the
soldiers
and
the
cannon
in
the
fort
a
bright
idea
struck
me
but
a
fool
one
just
the
same
it
was
no
less
than
a
desire
to
rope
one
of
the
cannons
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
rope
a
cannon
and
take
it
back
to
texas
with
us
to
fight
indians
with
the
bad
whiskey
which
i
carried
under
my
belt
was
responsible
for
the
fool
idea
and
gave
me
the
nerve
to
attempt
to
execute
the
idea
getting
my
lariat
rope
ready
i
rode
to
a
position
just
opposite
the
gate
of
the
fort
which
was
standing
open
before
the
gate
paced
a
sentry
with
his
gun
on
his
shoulder
and
his
white
gloves
showing
up
clean
and
white
against
the
dusty
grey
surroundings
i
waited
until
the
sentry
had
passed
the
gate
then
putting
spurs
to
my
horse
i
dashed
straight
for
and
through
the
gate
into
the
yard
the
surprised
sentry
called
halt
but
i
paid
no
attention
to
him
making
for
the
cannon
at
full
speed
my
rope
left
my
hand
and
settled
square
over
the
cannon
then
turning
and
putting
spurs
to
my
horse
i
tried
to
drag
the
cannon
after
me
but
strain
as
he
might
my
horse
was
unable
to
budge
it
an
inch
in
the
meantime
the
surprised
sentry
at
the
gate
had
given
the
alarm
and
now
i
heard
the
bugle
sound
boots
and
saddles
and
glancing
around
i
saw
the
soldiers
mounting
to
come
after
me
and
finding
i
could
not
move
the
cannon
i
rode
close
up
to
it
and
got
my
lariat
off
then
made
for
the
gate
again
at
full
speed
the
guard
jumped
in
front
of
me
with
his
gun
up
calling
halt
but
i
went
by
him
like
a
shot
expecting
to
hear
the
crack
of
his
musket
but
for
some
reason
he
failed
to
fire
on
me
and
i
made
for
the
open
prairie
with
the
cavalry
in
hot
pursuit
my
horse
could
run
like
a
wild
deer
but
he
was
no
match
for
the
big
strong
fresh
horses
of
the
soldiers
and
they
soon
had
me
relieving
me
of
my
arms
they
placed
me
in
the
guard
house
where
the
commanding
officer
came
to
see
me
he
asked
me
who
i
was
and
what
i
was
after
at
the
fort
i
told
him
and
then
he
asked
me
if
i
knew
anyone
in
the
city
i
told
him
i
knew
bat
masterson
he
ordered
two
guards
to
take
me
to
the
city
to
see
masterson
as
soon
as
masterson
saw
me
he
asked
me
what
the
trouble
was
and
before
i
could
answer
the
guards
told
him
i
rode
into
the
fort
and
roped
one
of
the
cannons
and
tried
to
pull
it
out
bat
asked
me
what
i
wanted
with
a
cannon
and
what
i
intended
doing
with
it
i
told
him
i
wanted
to
take
it
back
to
texas
with
me
to
fight
the
indians
with
then
they
all
laughed
then
bat
told
them
that
i
was
all
right
the
only
trouble
being
that
i
had
too
much
bad
whiskey
under
my
shirt
they
said
i
would
have
to
set
the
drinks
for
the
house
they
came
to
and
when
i
started
to
pay
for
them
bat
said
for
me
to
keep
my
money
that
he
would
pay
for
them
himself
which
he
did
bat
said
that
i
was
the
only
cowboy
that
he
liked
and
that
his
brother
jim
also
thought
very
much
of
me
i
was
then
let
go
and
i
joined
the
boys
and
we
continued
on
our
way
home
where
we
arrived
safely
on
the
of
june
illustration
i
rope
one
of
uncle
sam
cannon
fort
dodge
we
at
once
began
preparing
for
the
coming
big
round
up
as
usual
this
kept
us
very
busy
during
the
months
of
july
and
august
and
as
we
received
no
more
orders
for
cattle
this
season
we
did
not
have
to
take
the
trail
again
but
after
the
round
up
was
over
we
were
kept
busy
in
range
riding
and
the
general
all
around
work
of
the
big
cattle
ranch
we
had
at
this
time
on
the
ranch
upwards
of
head
of
cattle
our
own
cattle
not
to
mention
the
cattle
belonging
to
the
many
other
interests
without
the
pan
handle
country
and
as
all
these
immense
herds
used
the
range
of
the
country
in
common
as
there
was
no
fences
to
divide
the
ranches
consequently
the
cattle
belonging
to
the
different
herds
often
got
mixed
up
and
large
numbers
of
them
strayed
at
the
round
ups
it
was
our
duty
to
cut
out
and
brand
the
young
calves
take
a
census
of
our
stock
and
then
after
the
round
up
was
over
we
would
start
out
to
look
for
possible
strays
over
the
range
we
would
ride
through
canyons
and
gorges
and
every
place
where
it
was
possible
for
cattle
to
stray
as
it
was
important
to
get
them
with
the
main
herd
before
winter
set
in
as
if
left
out
in
small
bunches
there
was
danger
of
them
perishing
in
the
frequent
hard
storms
of
the
winter
while
range
riding
or
hunting
for
strays
we
always
carried
with
us
on
our
saddle
the
branding
irons
of
our
respective
ranches
and
whenever
we
ran
across
a
calf
that
had
not
been
branded
we
had
to
rope
the
calf
tie
it
then
a
fire
was
made
of
buffalo
chips
the
only
fuel
besides
grass
to
be
found
on
the
prairie
illustration
i
am
captured
by
the
soldiers
the
irons
were
heated
and
the
calf
was
branded
with
the
brand
of
the
finder
no
matter
who
it
personally
belonged
to
it
now
became
the
property
of
the
finder
the
lost
cattle
were
then
driven
to
the
main
herd
after
they
were
once
gotten
together
it
was
our
duty
to
keep
them
together
during
the
winter
and
early
spring
it
was
while
out
hunting
strays
that
i
got
lost
the
first
and
only
time
i
was
ever
lost
in
my
life
and
for
four
days
i
had
an
experience
that
few
men
ever
went
through
and
lived
as
it
was
a
close
pull
for
me
i
had
been
out
for
several
days
looking
for
lost
cattle
and
becoming
separated
from
the
other
boys
and
being
in
a
part
of
the
country
unfamiliar
to
me
it
was
stormy
when
i
started
out
from
the
home
ranch
and
when
i
had
ridden
about
a
hundred
miles
from
home
it
began
to
storm
in
earnest
rain
hail
sleet
and
the
clouds
seemed
to
touch
the
earth
and
gather
in
their
inpenetrable
embrace
every
thing
thereon
for
a
long
time
i
rode
on
in
the
direction
of
home
but
as
i
could
not
see
fifty
yards
ahead
it
was
a
case
of
going
it
blind
after
riding
for
many
weary
hours
through
the
storm
i
came
across
a
little
log
cabin
on
the
palidore
river
i
rode
up
to
within
one
hundred
yards
of
it
where
i
was
motioned
to
stop
by
an
old
long
haired
man
who
stepped
out
of
the
cabin
door
with
a
long
buffalo
gun
on
his
arm
it
was
with
this
he
had
motioned
me
to
stop
i
promptly
pulled
up
and
raised
my
hat
which
according
to
the
custom
of
the
cowboy
country
gave
him
to
understand
i
was
a
cowboy
from
the
western
cow
ranges
he
then
motioned
me
to
come
on
riding
up
to
the
cabin
he
asked
me
to
dismount
and
we
shook
hands
he
said
when
i
saw
you
coming
i
said
to
myself
that
must
be
a
lost
cowboy
from
some
of
the
western
cow
ranges
i
told
him
i
was
lost
all
right
and
i
told
him
who
i
was
and
where
from
again
we
shook
hands
he
saying
as
we
did
so
that
we
were
friends
until
we
met
again
and
he
hoped
forever
he
then
told
me
to
picket
out
my
horse
and
come
in
and
have
some
supper
which
very
welcome
invitation
i
accepted
his
cabin
was
constructed
of
rough
hewn
logs
somewhat
after
the
fashion
of
a
spanish
block
house
one
part
of
it
was
constructed
under
ground
a
sort
of
dug
out
while
the
upper
portion
of
the
cabin
proper
was
provided
with
many
loop
holes
commanding
every
direction
he
later
told
me
these
loop
holes
had
stood
him
in
handy
many
a
time
when
he
had
been
attacked
by
indians
in
their
efforts
to
capture
him
on
entering
his
cabin
i
was
amazed
to
see
the
walls
covered
with
all
kinds
of
skins
horns
and
antlers
buffalo
skins
in
great
numbers
covered
the
floor
and
bed
while
the
walls
were
completely
hidden
behind
the
skins
of
every
animal
of
that
region
including
large
number
of
rattle
snakes
skins
and
many
of
their
rattles
his
bed
which
was
in
one
corner
of
the
dug
out
was
of
skins
and
to
me
weary
from
my
long
ride
through
the
storm
seemed
to
be
the
most
comfortable
place
on
the
globe
just
then
he
soon
set
before
me
a
bounteous
supper
consisting
of
buffalo
meat
and
corn
dodgers
and
seldom
before
have
i
enjoyed
a
meal
as
i
did
that
one
during
supper
he
told
me
many
of
his
experiences
in
the
western
country
his
name
was
cater
and
he
was
one
of
the
oldest
buffalo
hunters
in
that
part
of
texas
having
hunted
and
trapped
over
the
wild
country
ever
since
the
early
thirties
and
during
that
time
he
had
many
a
thrilling
adventure
with
indians
and
wild
animals
i
stayed
with
him
that
night
and
slept
soundly
on
a
comfortable
bed
he
made
for
me
the
next
morning
he
gave
me
a
good
breakfast
and
i
prepared
to
take
my
departure
as
the
storm
had
somewhat
moderated
and
i
was
anxious
to
get
home
as
the
boys
knowing
i
was
out
would
be
looking
for
me
if
i
did
not
show
up
in
a
reasonable
time
illustration
in
my
fighting
clothes
my
kind
host
told
me
to
go
directly
northwest
and
i
would
strike
the
calones
flats
a
place
with
which
i
was
perfectly
familiar
he
said
it
was
about
miles
from
his
place
once
there
i
would
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
my
way
home
cater
put
me
up
a
good
lunch
to
last
me
on
my
way
and
with
many
expressions
of
gratitude
to
him
i
left
him
with
his
skins
and
comfortable
though
solitary
life
all
that
day
and
part
of
the
night
i
rode
in
the
direction
he
told
me
until
about
when
i
became
so
tired
i
decided
to
go
into
camp
and
give
my
tired
horse
a
rest
and
a
chance
to
eat
accordingly
i
dismounted
and
removed
the
saddle
and
bridle
from
my
horse
i
hobbled
him
and
turned
him
loose
to
graze
on
the
luxuriant
grass
while
i
tired
out
laid
down
with
my
head
on
my
saddle
fully
dressed
as
i
was
not
even
removing
my
belt
containing
my
pistol
from
my
waist
laying
my
winchester
close
by
the
rain
had
ceased
to
fall
but
it
was
still
cloudy
and
threatening
it
was
my
intention
to
rest
a
few
hours
then
continue
on
my
way
and
as
i
could
not
see
the
stars
on
account
of
the
clouds
and
as
it
was
important
that
i
keep
my
direction
northwest
in
order
to
strike
the
flats
i
had
carefully
taken
my
direction
before
sundown
and
now
on
moving
my
saddle
i
placed
it
on
the
ground
pointing
in
the
direction
i
was
going
when
i
stopped
so
that
it
would
enable
me
to
keep
my
direction
when
i
again
started
out
i
had
been
laying
there
for
some
time
and
my
horse
was
quietly
grazing
about
yards
off
when
i
suddenly
heard
something
squeal
it
sounded
like
a
woman
voice
it
frightened
my
horse
and
he
ran
for
me
i
jumped
to
my
feet
with
my
winchester
in
my
hand
this
caused
my
horse
to
rear
and
wheel
and
i
heard
his
hobbles
break
with
a
sharp
snap
then
i
heard
the
sound
of
his
galloping
feet
going
across
the
pan
handle
plains
until
the
sound
was
lost
in
the
distance
then
i
slowly
began
to
realize
that
i
was
left
alone
on
the
plains
on
foot
how
many
miles
from
home
i
did
not
know
remembering
i
had
my
guns
all
right
it
was
my
impulse
to
go
in
pursuit
of
my
horse
as
i
thought
i
could
eventually
catch
him
after
he
had
got
over
his
scare
but
when
i
thought
of
my
pound
saddle
and
i
did
not
want
to
leave
that
so
saying
to
myself
that
is
the
second
saddle
i
ever
owned
the
other
having
been
taken
by
the
indians
when
i
was
captured
and
this
saddle
was
part
of
the
outfit
presented
to
me
by
the
boys
and
so
tired
and
as
hungry
as
a
hawk
i
shouldered
my
saddle
and
started
out
in
the
direction
i
was
going
when
i
went
into
camp
saying
to
myself
as
i
did
so
if
my
horse
could
pack
me
and
my
outfit
day
and
night
i
can
at
least
pack
my
outfit
keeping
my
direction
as
well
as
i
could
i
started
out
over
the
prairie
through
the
dark
walking
all
that
night
and
all
the
next
day
without
anything
to
eat
or
drink
until
just
about
sundown
and
when
i
had
begun
to
think
i
would
have
to
spend
another
night
on
the
prairie
without
food
or
drink
when
i
emerged
from
a
little
draw
on
to
a
raise
on
the
prairie
then
looking
over
on
to
a
small
flat
i
saw
a
large
herd
of
buffalo
these
were
the
first
i
had
seen
since
i
became
lost
and
the
sight
of
them
put
renewed
life
and
hope
in
me
as
i
was
then
nearly
famished
and
when
i
saw
them
i
knew
i
had
something
to
eat
off
to
one
side
about
yards
from
the
main
herd
and
about
yards
from
me
was
a
young
calf
placing
my
winchester
to
my
shoulder
i
glanced
along
the
shining
barrel
but
my
hands
shook
so
much
i
lowered
it
again
not
that
i
was
afraid
of
missing
it
as
i
knew
i
was
a
dead
shot
at
that
distance
but
my
weakness
caused
by
my
long
enforced
fast
and
my
great
thirst
made
my
eyes
dim
and
my
hands
shake
in
a
way
they
had
never
done
before
so
waiting
a
few
moments
i
again
placed
the
gun
to
my
shoulder
and
this
time
it
spoke
and
the
calf
dropped
where
it
had
stood
picking
up
my
outfit
i
went
down
to
where
my
supper
was
laying
i
took
out
my
jack
knife
and
commenced
on
one
of
his
hind
quarters
i
began
to
skin
and
eat
to
my
hearts
content
but
i
was
so
very
thirsty
i
had
heard
of
people
drinking
blood
to
quench
their
thirst
and
that
gave
me
an
idea
so
cutting
the
calf
throat
with
my
knife
i
eagerly
drank
the
fresh
warm
blood
it
tasted
very
much
like
warm
sweet
milk
it
quenched
my
thirst
and
made
me
feel
strong
when
i
had
eaten
all
i
could
i
cut
off
two
large
chunks
of
the
meat
and
tied
them
to
my
saddle
then
again
shouldering
the
whole
thing
i
started
on
my
way
feeling
almost
as
satisfied
as
if
i
had
my
horse
with
me
i
was
lost
two
days
and
two
nights
after
my
horse
left
me
and
all
that
time
i
kept
walking
packing
my
pounds
saddle
and
my
winchester
and
two
cattle
pistols
on
the
second
night
about
daylight
the
weather
became
more
threatening
and
i
saw
in
the
distance
a
long
column
which
looked
like
smoke
it
seemed
to
be
coming
towards
me
at
the
rate
of
a
mile
a
minute
it
did
not
take
it
long
to
reach
me
and
when
it
did
i
struggled
on
for
a
few
yards
but
it
was
no
use
tired
as
i
was
from
packing
my
heavy
outfit
for
more
than
hours
and
my
long
tramp
i
had
not
the
strength
to
fight
against
the
storm
so
i
had
to
come
alone
when
i
again
came
to
myself
i
was
covered
up
head
and
foot
in
the
snow
in
the
camp
of
some
of
my
comrades
from
the
ranch
it
seemed
from
what
i
was
told
afterwards
that
the
boys
knowing
i
was
out
in
the
storm
and
failing
to
show
up
they
had
started
out
to
look
for
me
they
had
gone
in
camp
during
the
storm
and
when
the
blizzard
had
passed
they
noticed
an
object
out
on
the
prairie
in
the
snow
with
one
hand
frozen
clenched
around
my
winchester
and
the
other
around
the
horn
of
my
saddle
and
they
had
hard
work
to
get
my
hands
loose
they
picked
me
up
and
placed
me
on
one
of
the
horses
and
took
me
to
camp
where
they
stripped
me
of
my
clothes
and
wrapped
me
up
in
the
snow
all
the
skin
came
off
my
nose
and
mouth
and
my
hands
and
feet
had
been
so
badly
frozen
that
the
nails
all
came
off
after
i
had
got
thawed
out
in
the
mess
wagon
and
took
me
home
in
days
i
was
again
in
the
saddle
ready
for
business
but
i
will
never
forget
those
few
days
i
was
lost
and
the
marks
of
that
storm
i
will
carry
with
me
always
chapter
xiv
the
old
haze
and
elsworth
trail
our
trip
to
cheyenne
pat
garret
the
death
of
billy
the
kid
the
lincoln
county
cattle
war
early
the
next
spring
we
went
on
a
short
trip
to
junction
city
with
a
small
herd
of
horses
for
hokin
and
herst
we
started
out
from
the
home
ranch
early
in
april
stringing
the
herd
out
along
the
old
haze
and
elsworth
trail
everything
went
well
until
we
were
several
days
out
and
we
had
went
in
camp
for
the
night
the
herd
had
been
rounded
up
and
were
grazing
in
the
open
prairie
under
the
usual
watch
and
all
the
cowboys
except
the
first
watch
had
turned
in
for
a
good
night
rest
when
it
began
to
storm
finally
developing
into
a
genuine
old
fashioned
texas
storm
with
the
usual
result
that
the
herd
stampeded
the
watch
at
once
gave
the
alarm
and
we
awoke
to
find
everything
in
confusion
it
was
a
very
dark
night
and
under
such
circumstances
it
is
hard
to
control
a
herd
of
horses
in
a
stampede
in
a
few
moments
every
man
was
in
the
saddle
as
we
always
kept
our
saddle
horses
picketed
out
so
they
could
not
join
the
other
horses
and
it
was
our
custom
when
on
the
trail
with
a
herd
of
horses
on
going
into
camp
to
leave
our
saddle
horses
saddled
and
bridled
merely
loosing
the
cinches
of
the
saddles
though
sometimes
we
removed
the
bridles
to
enable
them
to
graze
better
so
when
the
alarm
was
given
in
this
instance
it
did
not
take
us
long
to
get
in
the
saddle
and
after
the
horses
who
were
now
going
across
the
prairie
as
only
frightened
horses
can
go
in
a
stampede
the
storm
continued
with
more
or
less
fury
all
night
and
it
was
late
the
next
day
before
we
got
the
herd
rounded
up
and
under
any
sort
of
control
the
next
morning
we
found
that
one
of
the
boys
frank
smith
had
lost
his
horse
and
outfit
during
the
night
while
chasing
the
horses
over
the
prairie
his
horse
stepped
in
a
prairie
dog
hole
and
fell
throwing
his
rider
and
snatching
the
rope
out
of
smith
hand
the
horse
made
off
over
the
prairie
carrying
with
him
bridle
saddle
and
outfit
and
we
never
saw
or
heard
of
him
again
after
getting
our
breakfast
we
continued
north
and
all
went
well
with
us
until
we
struck
the
wakeeny
river
near
junction
city
when
in
fording
the
stream
it
was
high
water
and
we
were
forced
to
swim
our
horses
across
all
went
well
with
the
herd
and
the
boys
were
following
when
one
of
them
came
near
being
drowned
and
was
only
saved
by
my
quick
rope
i
had
entered
the
river
and
my
horse
was
swimming
easily
when
on
glancing
around
i
saw
one
of
the
boys
loyd
hoedin
by
name
go
under
the
water
both
man
and
horse
completely
disappeared
they
soon
came
up
only
to
disappear
again
i
saw
at
once
something
was
wrong
so
when
they
came
up
the
second
time
i
threw
my
rope
it
fell
near
hoedin
who
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
grasp
it
and
hold
on
while
i
snaked
both
man
and
horse
out
to
safety
after
reaching
junction
city
and
turning
the
herd
over
to
their
new
owners
we
started
out
to
have
the
usual
good
time
this
lasted
for
several
days
during
which
time
we
cleaned
up
pretty
near
all
the
money
there
was
in
the
junction
with
our
horses
in
a
six
hundred
yard
race
between
ourselves
and
cow
boys
from
different
outfits
who
happened
to
be
in
the
city
our
horses
without
exception
proved
the
fastest
runners
accordingly
we
pocketed
considerable
coin
and
in
consequence
we
were
feeling
first
rate
when
we
struck
the
trail
homeward
bound
we
arrived
at
the
home
ranch
all
right
in
june
this
was
the
last
trip
we
were
called
to
make
this
season
and
our
time
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
was
taken
up
with
the
general
routine
work
of
the
large
cattle
ranch
late
the
next
season
we
took
the
trail
en
route
to
cheyenne
wyoming
with
two
thousand
head
of
fine
texas
steers
for
the
swan
brothers
miles
northwest
of
cheyenne
nothing
of
unusual
importance
happened
on
this
trip
aside
from
the
regular
incidents
pertaining
to
driving
such
a
large
herd
of
cattle
on
the
trail
we
had
a
few
stampedes
and
lost
a
few
cattle
arriving
in
cheyenne
we
had
a
royal
good
time
for
a
few
days
as
usual
before
starting
home
on
arriving
at
the
home
ranch
again
we
found
considerable
excitement
owing
to
the
war
between
the
cattle
men
and
cattle
rustlers
and
every
man
was
needed
at
home
and
few
there
were
who
did
not
take
part
in
one
way
or
another
in
the
most
bitter
and
furious
cattle
war
of
history
and
i
being
one
of
the
leading
cowboys
of
the
west
necessarily
took
an
active
part
in
the
dispute
and
many
were
the
sharp
clashes
between
the
waring
factions
that
i
witnessed
and
fought
in
and
was
wounded
many
times
in
these
engagements
for
years
the
cattle
rustlers
had
been
invading
the
large
cattle
ranges
belonging
to
the
large
cattle
kings
of
the
west
and
running
off
and
branding
large
numbers
of
choice
cattle
and
horses
this
led
to
many
a
sharp
fight
between
the
cowboys
and
the
rustlers
but
of
late
these
thieves
had
become
so
bold
and
the
losses
of
the
cattle
men
had
become
so
great
that
the
latter
determined
to
put
a
stop
to
it
and
so
open
war
was
declared
on
one
side
was
the
large
ranchmen
and
cattle
men
and
on
the
other
the
indians
half
breeds
mexicans
and
white
outlaws
that
made
the
cattle
country
their
rendezvous
the
cattle
men
had
now
organized
with
the
given
determination
of
either
killing
or
running
out
of
the
country
for
good
these
thieves
who
had
caused
them
so
much
loss
and
during
the
war
many
of
them
cashed
in
and
the
others
for
the
most
part
left
for
pastures
new
having
been
virtually
whipped
out
of
the
country
it
was
a
desperate
and
bloody
war
while
it
lasted
but
it
was
satisfactory
to
the
cattle
men
who
could
now
rest
easier
in
the
security
of
their
herds
and
their
grazing
grounds
it
was
at
this
time
that
i
saw
considerable
of
william
bonney
alias
billie
the
kid
the
most
noted
desperado
and
all
around
bad
man
the
world
has
known
the
first
time
i
met
billie
the
kid
was
in
antonshico
new
mexico
in
a
saloon
when
he
asked
me
to
drink
with
him
that
was
in
later
he
hired
to
pete
galligan
the
man
in
whose
employ
i
was
galligan
hired
the
kid
to
drive
his
buck
board
between
the
white
oaks
the
nearest
town
and
galligan
ranch
with
provisions
for
the
boys
and
the
kid
told
me
himself
that
one
these
trips
he
would
drive
the
team
on
a
dead
run
the
whole
distance
of
miles
to
the
oaks
in
order
to
get
there
quick
so
he
would
have
more
time
to
stay
around
town
before
it
was
time
to
start
back
then
when
he
would
arrive
home
the
team
was
nearly
dead
from
exhaustion
he
remained
in
the
employ
of
galligan
for
about
eleven
months
then
he
was
hired
by
john
chisholm
to
rustle
cattle
for
him
chisholm
agreed
to
pay
the
kid
so
much
per
head
for
all
the
cattle
the
kid
rustled
when
the
time
came
for
a
settlement
chisholm
failed
to
settle
right
or
to
the
kid
satisfaction
then
the
kid
told
chisholm
he
would
give
him
one
day
to
make
up
his
mind
to
settle
right
but
before
the
kid
could
see
chisholm
again
chisholm
left
the
country
going
east
where
his
brother
was
the
kid
then
swore
vengeance
and
said
he
would
take
his
revenge
out
of
chisholm
men
and
he
at
once
began
killing
all
the
employ
of
john
chisholm
he
would
ride
up
to
a
bunch
of
cowboys
and
enquire
if
they
worked
for
chisholm
if
they
replied
in
the
affirmative
he
would
shoot
them
dead
on
the
spot
and
few
men
were
quicker
with
a
or
a
deadly
shot
than
billie
the
kid
the
next
time
i
met
the
kid
was
in
holbrook
arizona
just
after
a
big
round
up
the
kid
buck
cannon
and
billie
woods
were
together
i
was
on
my
way
to
silver
city
new
mexico
in
the
fall
of
when
i
met
them
and
as
they
were
going
there
also
we
rode
on
together
the
kid
showed
me
the
little
log
cabin
where
he
said
he
was
born
i
went
in
the
cabin
with
him
and
he
showed
me
how
it
was
arranged
when
he
lived
there
showing
me
where
the
bed
sat
and
the
stove
and
table
he
then
pointed
out
the
old
postoffice
which
he
said
he
had
been
in
lots
of
times
he
told
me
he
was
born
and
raised
in
silver
city
new
mexico
which
is
near
the
moggocilion
mountains
and
at
that
time
the
kid
was
badly
wanted
by
the
sheriffs
of
several
counties
for
numerous
murders
committed
by
him
mostly
of
john
chisholm
men
in
texas
and
new
mexico
the
kid
bid
me
good
bye
he
said
he
was
going
to
the
mountains
as
he
knew
them
well
and
once
there
he
was
all
right
as
he
could
stand
off
a
regiment
of
soldiers
the
three
of
them
departed
together
i
never
saw
him
again
until
the
spring
of
i
was
in
the
city
of
elmorgo
new
mexico
and
saw
him
the
morning
he
was
forced
to
flee
to
the
mountains
to
escape
arrest
we
could
see
him
up
there
behind
the
rocks
he
was
well
armed
having
with
him
two
winchesters
and
two
colts
revolvers
and
plenty
of
ammunition
and
although
the
officers
wanted
him
badly
no
one
dared
go
up
after
him
as
it
was
certain
death
to
come
with
range
of
the
kid
guns
later
on
he
escaped
and
the
next
time
i
saw
him
was
in
antonshico
new
mexico
it
was
in
june
and
we
had
come
up
from
colonas
after
some
saddle
horses
and
i
met
and
talked
with
him
the
next
time
i
saw
him
he
was
laying
dead
at
pete
maxwell
ranch
in
lincoln
county
new
mexico
having
been
killed
by
pat
garret
at
that
time
sheriff
of
lincoln
county
new
mexico
we
arrived
in
lincoln
county
the
very
night
he
was
killed
at
pete
maxwell
ranch
and
went
into
camp
a
short
distance
from
maxwell
and
we
saw
the
kid
a
short
time
after
he
had
been
killed
the
kid
had
been
arrested
by
pat
garret
and
his
posse
a
short
time
before
at
stinking
springs
new
mexico
along
with
tom
pickett
billy
wilson
and
dave
rudebough
after
arresting
these
men
which
was
only
effected
after
a
hard
fight
and
after
the
ammunition
had
given
out
garret
took
the
men
heavily
ironed
to
los
vegas
when
it
became
known
that
billy
the
kid
had
been
captured
a
mob
formed
for
the
purpose
of
lynching
him
but
garret
placed
his
prisoners
in
a
box
car
over
which
himself
and
deputies
stood
guard
until
the
train
pulled
out
which
was
nearly
two
hours
during
that
time
the
mob
was
furious
to
get
at
the
men
but
they
well
knew
the
temper
of
sheriff
garret
so
they
kept
their
distance
the
men
were
tried
and
convicted
the
kid
and
rudbough
were
sentenced
to
be
hanged
rudbough
for
having
killed
a
jailer
at
los
vegas
in
the
judge
on
passing
sentence
on
the
kid
said
you
are
sentenced
to
be
hanged
by
the
neck
until
you
are
the
kid
laughed
in
the
judge
face
saying
and
you
can
go
to
hell
hell
hell
after
the
kid
had
been
sentenced
he
was
placed
in
jail
at
los
vegas
ironed
hand
and
foot
and
under
heavy
guard
but
never
lost
confidence
and
was
always
looking
for
a
chance
to
escape
when
the
day
of
his
execution
was
not
much
more
than
a
week
off
the
kid
saw
his
chance
while
eating
his
supper
both
handcuffs
had
been
fastened
to
one
wrist
so
the
kid
could
better
feed
himself
he
was
only
guarded
by
one
deputy
named
bell
the
other
deputy
ollinger
had
gone
to
supper
across
the
street
from
the
jail
bell
turned
his
head
for
a
moment
and
the
kid
noticing
the
movement
quick
as
a
flash
brought
the
handcuffs
down
on
bell
head
stunning
him
the
kid
then
snatched
bell
revolver
he
shot
the
deputy
through
the
body
bell
staggered
to
the
steps
down
which
he
fell
and
into
the
yard
below
where
he
died
ollinger
hearing
the
shot
rushed
across
the
street
as
he
entered
the
jail
yard
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
kid
at
a
window
as
he
did
so
the
kid
shot
ollinger
dead
with
a
shot
gun
which
was
loaded
with
buck
shot
the
kid
then
broke
the
gun
across
the
window
sill
then
going
to
the
room
where
the
weapons
were
kept
the
kid
picked
out
what
guns
he
wanted
and
broke
the
balance
then
he
made
the
first
person
he
met
break
the
irons
from
his
legs
and
bring
him
a
horse
the
kid
then
took
four
revolvers
and
two
winchester
rifles
and
rode
away
sheriff
garret
was
at
white
oaks
at
the
time
and
as
soon
he
as
heard
of
the
escape
he
hurried
home
and
organized
a
posse
to
recapture
the
kid
but
the
kid
was
at
liberty
two
months
before
he
was
finally
rounded
up
and
killed
at
pete
maxwell
ranch
at
the
time
the
kid
escaped
at
los
vegas
myself
and
a
party
of
our
boys
had
our
horses
at
menderhall
and
hunter
livery
stable
just
a
few
doors
from
the
jail
and
i
was
standing
on
the
street
talking
to
a
friend
when
the
kid
rode
by
from
los
vegas
he
went
to
the
borders
of
lincoln
county
where
his
ever
ready
revolver
was
always
in
evidence
shortly
after
his
escape
he
shot
and
killed
william
mathews
and
a
companion
whom
he
met
on
the
prairie
without
apparent
cause
and
several
other
murders
were
attributed
to
him
before
he
was
finally
located
at
maxwell
ranch
and
killed
by
sheriff
garret
the
kid
was
only
years
of
age
when
his
wild
career
was
ended
by
the
bullet
from
the
sheriff
gun
and
it
is
safe
to
assert
he
had
at
lease
one
murder
to
the
credit
of
every
year
of
his
life
he
was
killed
by
sheriff
garret
in
a
room
of
one
of
the
old
houses
at
fort
sumner
known
at
that
time
as
maxwell
ranch
july
about
two
months
after
his
escape
from
the
lincoln
county
jail
and
sheriff
pat
garret
one
of
the
nervest
men
of
that
country
of
nervy
men
and
the
only
man
who
ever
pursued
the
kid
and
lived
to
tell
the
tale
is
at
present
at
the
head
of
the
customs
service
at
el
paso
texas
and
to
meet
him
and
note
his
pleasant
smile
and
kindly
disposition
one
would
not
believe
him
the
man
who
sent
billie
the
kid
to
his
last
account
but
behind
the
pleasant
twinkle
in
his
eye
and
the
warm
hand
clasp
there
is
a
head
as
cool
and
a
nerve
as
steady
as
ever
held
a
chapter
xvii
another
trip
to
old
mexico
i
rope
an
engine
i
fall
in
love
my
courtship
death
of
my
sweetheart
my
promised
wife
i
must
bear
a
charmed
life
the
advent
of
progress
the
last
of
the
range
on
one
of
these
memorable
trips
after
cattle
and
with
cattle
on
the
trail
one
that
i
will
most
likely
remember
the
longest
was
a
trip
to
old
mexico
after
a
herd
of
horses
it
was
on
this
trip
that
i
fell
in
love
the
first
time
in
my
life
during
my
wild
career
on
the
western
plains
i
had
met
many
handsome
women
and
they
often
made
much
of
me
but
somehow
i
had
never
experienced
the
feeling
called
love
until
i
met
my
charming
sweetheart
in
old
mexico
i
had
perhaps
been
too
much
absorbed
in
the
wild
life
of
the
plains
in
the
horses
and
cattle
which
made
up
my
world
to
have
the
time
or
inclination
to
seek
or
enjoy
the
company
of
the
gentler
sex
but
now
that
i
had
met
my
fate
i
suppose
i
became
as
silly
about
it
as
any
tenderfoot
from
the
east
could
possibly
be
as
evidence
of
how
badly
i
was
hit
while
on
the
trail
with
the
herd
our
route
lay
along
a
narrow
gauge
railroad
and
i
was
feeling
up
in
the
air
caused
no
doubt
partly
from
the
effects
of
love
and
partly
from
the
effects
of
mexican
whiskey
a
generous
measure
i
had
under
my
belt
however
i
was
feeling
fine
so
when
the
little
engine
came
puffing
along
in
the
distance
i
said
to
the
boys
i
have
roped
nearly
everything
that
could
be
roped
so
now
i
am
going
to
rope
the
engine
they
tried
to
persuade
me
not
to
make
the
attempt
but
i
was
in
no
mood
to
listen
to
reason
or
anything
else
so
when
the
engine
came
along
i
put
my
spurs
to
my
horse
and
when
near
enough
i
let
fly
my
lariat
the
rope
settled
gracefully
around
the
smoke
stack
and
as
usual
my
trained
horse
set
himself
back
for
the
shock
but
the
engine
set
both
myself
and
my
horse
in
the
ditch
and
might
have
continued
to
set
us
in
places
had
not
something
given
way
as
it
was
the
rope
parted
but
the
boys
said
afterwards
that
they
thought
they
would
have
to
send
for
a
wrecking
train
to
clean
the
track
or
rather
the
ditch
illustration
i
rope
a
narrow
gauge
engine
my
lariat
settled
gracefully
around
the
smokestack
and
my
trained
horse
set
himself
for
the
shock
but
the
engine
set
both
myself
and
my
horse
in
the
ditch
roping
a
live
engine
is
by
long
odds
worse
than
roping
wild
buffalo
on
the
plains
or
uncle
sam
cannon
at
the
forts
this
incident
cleared
the
atmosphere
somewhat
but
my
love
was
as
strong
as
ever
and
i
thanked
my
lucky
start
she
did
not
see
me
as
they
dragged
me
out
of
the
ditch
i
first
saw
my
sweetheart
as
we
were
driving
the
herd
along
the
dusty
road
passing
a
small
adobe
house
near
the
city
of
old
mexico
i
saw
a
handsome
young
spanish
girl
standing
in
the
yard
and
i
suppose
i
fell
in
love
with
her
at
first
sight
anyway
i
pretended
to
be
very
thirsty
and
rode
up
and
asked
her
for
a
drink
she
gave
it
to
me
and
i
exchanged
a
few
words
with
her
before
joining
the
boys
and
the
herds
after
that
i
saw
her
quite
often
during
my
stay
in
old
mexico
before
we
again
returned
home
one
day
shortly
before
i
was
to
leave
for
the
north
i
went
to
see
her
and
overheard
a
conversation
between
her
and
her
mother
in
which
her
mother
said
to
her
my
daughter
will
you
leave
your
mother
for
to
go
with
the
wild
cowboy
and
she
answered
no
mother
i
will
not
leave
you
to
go
with
any
wild
cowboy
on
hearing
this
i
bid
her
goodbye
and
a
long
farewell
as
i
told
her
i
did
not
expect
to
ever
see
her
again
then
leaping
to
the
back
of
my
faithful
horse
i
rode
like
mad
across
the
mexican
plains
until
i
had
somewhat
cooled
down
but
it
was
a
hard
blow
to
me
as
i
truly
loved
her
after
that
i
joined
the
boys
and
returned
up
the
trail
with
them
six
or
seven
months
later
we
were
again
in
old
mexico
with
a
herd
of
cattle
and
went
in
camp
some
distance
out
from
the
city
and
as
soon
as
she
heard
our
outfit
had
returned
she
rode
out
to
the
camp
and
after
looking
around
and
not
seeing
me
she
said
to
the
camp
boss
where
is
the
wild
cowboy
that
was
here
with
you
last
time
did
he
not
come
up
the
trail
with
you
the
boss
told
her
i
had
come
up
the
trail
but
that
i
had
not
been
seen
since
crossing
the
last
mountains
as
of
course
he
knew
whom
she
meant
as
my
little
love
affair
was
pretty
generally
known
among
the
boys
when
the
boss
told
her
that
i
had
not
been
seen
since
they
had
crossed
the
last
mountains
she
hung
her
head
and
looked
completely
heart
broken
i
was
lying
in
the
mess
wagon
at
the
time
an
interested
spectator
of
all
that
took
place
and
seeing
her
looking
so
downhearted
i
could
hardly
restrain
myself
from
jumping
out
of
the
wagon
and
taking
her
in
my
arms
after
a
time
she
slowly
raised
her
head
and
looked
long
and
wistfully
up
the
trail
then
turning
to
the
camp
boss
again
she
said
camp
boss
tell
me
truly
if
nat
love
works
with
you
and
did
he
come
on
this
trip
with
you
the
boss
answered
her
as
before
that
i
had
not
been
seen
since
crossing
the
last
mountains
which
was
true
as
i
had
been
riding
in
the
mess
wagon
on
hearing
the
boss
answer
she
took
it
as
final
and
started
to
ride
away
illustration
the
first
glimpse
of
my
spanish
sweetheart
i
thought
it
high
time
to
make
my
presence
known
as
with
the
sight
of
her
all
my
old
love
returned
and
i
forgot
every
thing
except
that
i
loved
her
so
i
jumped
out
of
the
wagon
exclaiming
here
i
am
and
in
a
minute
we
were
locked
in
each
others
arms
and
i
believe
i
kissed
her
before
all
the
boys
but
i
did
care
she
was
mine
now
we
became
engaged
and
were
to
be
married
in
the
fall
and
were
to
make
our
home
in
the
city
of
mexico
but
in
the
spring
she
took
sick
and
died
her
death
broke
me
all
up
and
after
i
buried
her
i
became
very
wild
and
reckless
not
caring
what
happened
to
me
and
when
you
saw
me
in
the
saddle
you
saw
me
at
home
and
while
i
saw
many
women
since
i
could
never
care
for
any
as
i
did
for
her
and
i
vainly
tried
to
forget
her
and
my
sorrow
in
the
wild
life
of
the
plains
and
every
danger
i
could
find
courting
death
in
fights
with
indians
and
mexicans
and
dare
devil
riding
on
the
range
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
bore
a
charmed
life
horses
were
shot
from
under
me
men
were
killed
around
me
but
always
i
escaped
with
a
trifling
wound
at
the
worst
as
time
passed
i
began
to
recover
from
my
disappointment
and
to
take
my
old
interest
in
the
work
of
the
ranch
and
as
my
reputation
had
spread
over
the
country
i
did
not
lack
work
but
was
kept
on
the
go
all
the
time
first
with
one
large
cattle
owner
then
with
another
most
of
my
working
being
in
the
round
ups
and
brandings
brand
reading
and
with
large
herds
on
the
trail
as
during
my
long
experience
in
the
cattle
country
i
had
traveled
every
known
trail
and
over
immense
stretches
of
country
where
there
was
no
sign
of
a
trail
nothing
but
the
wide
expanse
of
prairie
bare
except
for
the
buffalo
grass
with
here
and
there
a
lone
tree
or
a
giant
cactus
standing
as
a
lone
sentinel
in
the
wildest
of
long
stretches
of
grazing
land
rolling
away
in
billows
of
hill
and
gully
like
the
waves
of
the
ocean
likewise
i
could
read
identify
and
place
every
brand
or
mark
placed
on
a
horse
or
steer
between
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
borders
of
canada
on
the
north
and
from
missouri
to
california
over
this
stretch
of
country
i
have
often
traveled
with
herds
of
horses
or
cattle
or
in
searching
for
strays
or
hunting
the
noble
buffalo
on
his
own
native
feeding
grounds
the
great
buffalo
slaughter
commenced
in
the
west
in
and
in
they
had
become
so
scarce
that
it
was
a
rare
occasion
when
you
came
across
a
herd
containing
more
than
fifty
animals
where
before
you
could
find
thousands
in
a
herd
many
things
were
responsible
for
the
slaughter
but
the
principal
reason
that
they
had
now
become
so
scarce
was
that
in
and
the
indians
started
to
kill
them
in
large
numbers
for
their
skins
thousands
were
killed
by
them
skinned
and
the
carcasses
left
as
food
for
the
wolves
and
vultures
of
the
prairie
many
were
killed
by
the
white
hunters
to
furnish
meat
for
the
railroad
graders
and
the
troups
at
the
frontier
forts

thy
time
has
passed

once

thousands

and

across
their
once
peaceful
path
now
thunders
the
iron
horse
awakening
the
echoes
far
and
near
with
bell
and
whistle
where
once
could
only
be
heard
the
sharp
crack
of
the

the
long
doleful
yelp
of
the
coyote
at

the
only
buffalo
to
be
found
are
in
the
private
parks
of
a
few
men
who
are
preserving
them
for
pleasure
or
profit
with
the
march
of
progress
came
the
railroad
and
no
longer
were
we
called
upon
to
follow
the
long
horned
steers
or
mustangs
on
the
trail
while
the
immense
cattle
ranges
stretching
away
in
the
distance
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
now
began
to
be
dotted
with
cities
and
towns
and
the
cattle
industry
which
once
held
a
monopoly
in
the
west
now
had
to
give
way
to
the
industry
of
the
farm
and
the
mill
to
us
wild
cowboys
of
the
range
used
to
the
wild
and
unrestricted
life
of
the
boundless
plains
the
new
order
of
things
did
not
appeal
and
many
of
us
became
disgusted
and
quit
the
wild
life
for
the
pursuits
of
our
more
civilized
brother
i
was
among
that
number
and
in
i
bid
farewell
to
the
life
which
i
had
followed
for
over
twenty
years
it
was
with
genuine
regret
that
i
left
the
long
horn
texas
cattle
and
the
wild
mustangs
of
the
range
but
the
life
had
in
a
great
measure
lost
its
attractions
and
so
i
decided
to
quit
it
and
try
something
else
for
a
while
during
my
life
so
far
i
had
no
chance
to
secure
an
education
except
the
education
of
the
plains
and
the
cattle
business
in
this
i
recognize
no
superior
being
gifted
with
a
splendid
memory
and
quick
observation
i
learned
and
remembered
things
that
others
passed
by
and
forgot
and
i
have
yet
to
meet
the
man
who
can
give
me
instruction
in
the
phases
of
a
life
in
which
i
spent
so
long
after
quitting
the
cowboy
life
i
struck
out
for
denver
here
i
met
and
married
the
present
love
my
second
love
we
were
married
august
and
she
is
with
me
now
a
true
and
faithful
partner
and
says
she
is
not
one
bit
jealous
of
my
first
love
who
lies
buried
in
the
city
of
old
mexico
one
year
later
in
i
accepted
a
position
in
the
pullman
service
on
the
denver
and
rio
grande
railroad
running
between
denver
and
salida
colorado
the
pullman
service
was
then
in
its
infancy
so
to
speak
as
there
was
as
much
difference
between
the
pullman
sleeping
cars
of
those
days
and
the
present
as
there
is
between
the
ox
team
and
the
automobile

the

life
on
the
rail
my
first
trip
a
slump
in
tips
i
become
disgusted
and
quit
a
period
of
husking
my
next
trip
on
the
pullman
tips
and
the
people
who
give
them
after
my
marriage
in
denver
i
rented
a
small
cottage
which
i
comfortably
furnished
and
we
love
and
myself
started
to
housekeeping
in
a
modest
way
then
i
began
to
look
around
for
a
job
but
to
a
man
who
was
used
to
the
excitement
and
continual
action
of
the
range
and
the
cattle
ranches
the
civilized
and
quiet
life
of
the
city
is
apt
to
prove
stale
and
uninteresting
it
was
that
way
with
me
and
after
passing
up
several
jobs
offered
to
me
i
thought
i
would
try
railroading
for
awhile
probably
for
the
same
reason
that
prompted
me
to
leave
home
twenty
years
before
i
still
wanted
to
see
the
world
with
that
idea
in
mind
i
went
to
the
pullman
offices
in
denver
and
after
making
some
inquiries
i
was
directed
to
the
office
of
superintendent
rummels
who
was
at
that
time
superintendent
of
the
pullman
service
a
wright
was
his
assistant
i
found
superintendent
rummels
in
his
office
and
i
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
hire
any
more
porters
he
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
worked
for
the
pullman
company
i
told
him
no
that
i
had
been
a
cowboy
ever
since
i
was
years
old
he
then
asked
me
if
i
had
money
enough
to
buy
my
pullman
uniform
i
asked
him
how
much
it
would
cost
and
he
said
i
told
him
yes
i
had
the
price
he
asked
me
if
i
knew
any
one
in
denver
i
told
him
yes
and
gave
him
the
name
of
sprangler
who
had
my
money
in
his
bank
supt
rummels
told
me
to
get
a
letter
from
sprangler
and
he
would
put
me
on
so
i
went
and
got
the
letter
and
with
it
the
money
to
pay
for
my
uniform
after
having
my
measure
taken
and
sending
for
my
suit
i
borrowed
a
uniform
from
one
of
the
other
porters
and
the
second
day
after
i
called
on
the
superintendent
i
was
sent
on
the
run
between
denver
and
salida
one
of
the
old
men
put
me
on
to
my
duties
and
showed
me
how
to
make
up
my
car
and
the
general
run
of
things
on
my
first
trip
i
found
a
kind
friend
in
the
pullman
conductor
a
keely
who
helped
me
in
many
ways
and
i
suppose
i
made
many
blunders
as
the
difference
between
a
pullman
car
and
the
back
of
a
texas
mustang
is
very
great
however
i
managed
to
get
around
among
the
passengers
in
my
car
and
attend
to
their
needs
in
some
sort
of
a
way
my
first
trouble
commenced
when
i
succeeded
in
getting
the
shoes
of
passengers
which
had
been
given
to
me
to
polish
badly
mixed
up
the
shoes
of
a
portly
red
faced
man
whose
berth
was
in
the
forward
end
of
the
car
i
placed
by
the
berth
of
a
tall
and
slim
western
yankee
at
the
other
end
of
the
car
while
a
number
and
a
number
shoe
were
placed
decorously
by
the
berth
of
a
sour
spinster
from
new
york
this
naturally
caused
a
good
sized
rumpus
the
next
morning
and
sundry
blessings
were
heaped
on
the
head
of
yours
truly
nearly
all
the
passengers
were
mad
and
the
tips
were
conspicuous
by
their
absence
that
made
me
mad
and
thoroughly
disgusted
with
the
job
on
returning
to
denver
i
again
called
on
superintendent
rummels
and
told
him
that
i
had
enough
of
the
pullman
service
and
would
rather
go
back
to
the
cattle
and
the
range
superintendent
rummels
tried
to
persuade
me
to
stay
with
it
saying
i
had
done
all
right
and
would
improve
with
experience
but
i
was
thoroughly
disgusted
and
wanted
no
more
of
it
so
i
turned
in
my
keys
got
my
uniform
and
walked
out
so
again
i
was
without
a
job
after
going
around
denver
for
several
days
it
struck
me
that
there
was
money
to
be
made
selling
fruit
vegetables
honey
and
chickens
around
the
town
accordingly
i
purchased
a
horse
and
wagon
and
an
assorted
stock
and
started
out
on
my
new
vocation
this
proved
profitable
from
the
start
and
i
made
good
money
which
caused
me
to
stay
with
it
for
nearly
a
year
when
my
natural
restfulness
caused
me
to
become
discontented
and
to
yearn
for
more
excitement
and
something
a
little
faster
so
i
disposed
of
my
stock
horse
and
wagon
and
started
out
to
look
for
something
else
to
do
but
that
something
else
was
about
as
hard
to
find
as
the
proverbial
needle
in
the
straw
stack
at
that
particular
time
whether
it
was
fate
or
the
talk
of
the
other
porters
whom
i
met
i
finally
concluded
to
give
the
pullman
service
another
try
accordingly
i
called
on
smith
who
was
now
district
superintendent
of
the
pullman
service
and
asked
him
for
a
job
he
asked
me
if
i
had
been
in
the
company
service
before
and
i
told
him
yes
he
asked
me
how
long
and
i
told
him
one
trip
and
i
told
him
why
i
quit
and
that
the
tips
were
too
slow
for
me
he
asked
me
if
i
thought
it
was
any
better
now
and
i
said
i
did
not
know
whether
it
was
any
better
or
not
but
that
i
thought
i
could
do
better
he
told
me
the
whole
secret
of
success
was
in
pleasing
all
my
passengers
i
told
him
i
thought
it
was
all
right
about
pleasing
two
or
three
passengers
but
when
it
came
to
pleasing
a
whole
car
full
of
passengers
that
was
another
matter
he
said
to
try
anyway
he
than
assigned
me
to
a
car
running
on
the
narrow
gauge
line
between
denver
and
alamosa
creed
and
durango
this
was
the
real
beginning
of
my
pullman
service
i
ran
on
the
colorado
roads
under
superintendent
smith
for
a
number
of
years
and
always
found
him
courteous
and
obliging
always
ready
and
willing
to
help
us
with
advice
and
counsel
but
what
proved
a
mystery
to
me
for
a
long
time
was
how
the
superintendent
managed
to
find
out
things
that
happened
on
my
car
when
he
was
not
present
sometimes
when
i
went
to
report
or
met
him
he
would
question
me
about
things
that
happened
on
my
run
such
as
pleasing
the
passengers
and
other
things
which
i
did
not
suppose
he
knew
a
thing
about
and
inquiries
among
the
other
trainmen
only
deepened
the
mystery
i
would
ask
the
pullman
conductor
if
he
told
the
superintendent
such
and
such
a
thing
and
he
would
say
no
then
i
would
ask
him
how
the
superintendent
knew
about
them
as
he
was
not
on
the
train
he
would
say
he
did
not
know
this
kept
up
until
finally
i
made
up
my
mind
that
if
there
ever
was
a
clairvoyant
the
superintendent
certainly
was
one
the
fact
that
he
was
able
to
find
out
things
that
happened
hundreds
of
miles
away
without
any
one
telling
him
kept
me
worked
up
for
a
long
time
until
i
finally
tumbled
to
the
special
agents
who
are
employed
to
travel
as
common
passengers
and
report
how
things
are
going
to
the
superintendent
that
explained
the
whole
mystery
but
it
did
not
in
any
way
make
me
move
easy
in
my
mind
because
if
a
special
agent
was
along
one
trip
there
was
no
reason
to
think
that
one
was
not
along
every
trip
at
least
i
made
up
my
mind
there
was
and
governed
myself
accordingly
but
the
increased
attention
given
to
my
passengers
as
a
result
caused
an
increase
in
the
tips
that
came
my
way
with
the
increase
in
my
earnings
and
the
experience
i
was
gaining
i
came
to
have
a
liking
for
the
service
which
is
in
no
wise
diminished
at
this
time
i
soon
learned
the
knack
of
pleasing
the
greater
number
of
my
passengers
and
this
reported
to
the
superintendent
by
the
special
agents
raised
me
in
the
official
favor
with
the
result
that
i
was
given
more
extensive
and
more
profitable
runs
and
soon
became
one
of
the
most
popular
porters
in
colorado
this
brought
with
it
increased
responsibilities
as
well
as
increased
profits
and
favors
enjoyed
when
i
started
to
work
it
was
for
per
month
this
has
been
increased
from
time
to
time
until
at
present
owing
to
my
long
service
and
having
gained
a
thorough
knowledge
of
my
business
i
am
often
made
porter
in
charge
this
position
pays
me
as
high
as
per
month
the
difference
between
a
porter
and
a
porter
in
charge
is
that
a
porter
generally
has
a
car
over
which
a
pullman
conductor
presides
which
the
porter
in
charge
owing
to
his
long
service
and
his
knowledge
of
the
business
is
placed
in
full
charge
of
a
car
making
the
services
of
a
pullman
conductor
unnecessary
a
porter
in
the
employ
of
the
pullman
company
for
ten
years
and
giving
good
service
for
that
time
receives
from
the
company
two
suits
of
clothes
per
year
and
other
privileges
not
enjoyed
by
the
beginner
a
porter
just
beginning
in
the
service
has
to
purchase
his
own
uniform
the
cost
of
which
is
never
less
than
for
the
summer
suit
or
for
the
winter
suit
after
five
years
of
good
service
a
porter
is
entitled
to
wear
one
white
stripe
on
his
coat
sleeve
to
which
one
is
added
for
every
succeeding
five
years
of
good
service
naturally
the
porter
that
understands
his
business
and
gives
his
whole
attention
to
the
passengers
in
his
car
and
to
his
work
will
make
more
money
than
the
porter
who
has
not
the
patience
to
try
and
please
his
passengers
i
have
had
porters
complain
to
me
about
the
small
amount
they
were
able
to
earn
in
the
service
and
on
questioning
them
i
found
it
was
wholly
because
they
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
try
and
make
friends
of
the
people
in
their
car
i
early
recognized
the
fact
that
if
i
expected
to
succeed
in
the
pullman
service
i
must
make
all
the
friends
i
could
on
my
runs
and
the
cases
are
very
rare
where
i
have
failed
to
receive
a
tip
of
some
kind
from
my
passengers
although
as
it
happens
sometimes
i
have
people
in
my
car
who
are
not
very
well
blessed
with
this
world
goods
and
who
can
ill
afford
to
spend
money
in
tips
to
such
people
i
always
give
the
same
attention
and
care
as
if
i
was
sure
to
receive
a
tip
and
they
rarely
failed
to
give
me
a
kind
thank
you
on
leaving
my
car
in
the
course
of
our
duties
we
naturally
meet
all
manner
of
people
the
business
man
out
for
business
or
pleasure
the
drummers
who
nearly
always
give
us
a
tip
the
wife
going
to
join
her
sick
husband
or
the
husband
hurrying
home
to
the
bedside
of
his
sick
child
the
invalid
in
search
of
health
or
the
family
going
home
to
attend
the
funeral
of
a
loved
one
the
young
man
going
to
be
married
and
the
young
couple
on
their
honeymoon
the
capitalist
the
miner
the
sportsman
and
the
vast
army
of
people
that
go
to
make
up
the
traveling
public
who
like
the
sands
of
the
desert
are
forever
shifting
around
from
place
to
place
and
with
whom
we
porters
are
brought
in
closer
contact
perhaps
than
any
one
else
on
their
travels
we
must
necessarily
be
good
judges
of
human
nature
to
be
able
to
please
the
majority
of
the
people
who
travel
under
our
care
we
nearly
always
receive
a
tip
from
those
who
ride
with
us
for
any
distance
the
size
of
the
tip
often
depends
on
the
mode
of
the
passenger
giving
it
even
those
who
ride
with
us
only
a
short
distance
often
give
us
a
tip
of
more
generous
proportions
than
will
the
man
who
has
ridden
with
us
several
thousands
of
miles
the
superintendent
himself
when
he
rides
in
our
car
we
are
sure
to
receive
from
him
cents
or
cents
for
a
day
or
a
day
ride
the
smallest
tip
i
have
received
from
a
passenger
during
my
service
was
cents
this
amount
i
received
from
a
rather
cranky
individual
who
when
i
went
to
brush
him
off
handed
me
two
copper
cents
and
followed
them
up
with
the
remark
that
some
of
us
porters
needed
calling
down
and
some
needed
knocking
down
my
opinion
if
what
he
needed
caused
me
to
smile
wherein
he
wanted
to
know
what
i
was
smiling
at
needless
to
say
i
did
not
feel
like
wasting
any
more
breath
on
him
so
i
bundled
his
boxes
and
satchel
out
on
the
platform
and
left
him
to
follow
at
his
leisure
the
largest
tips
i
ever
received
from
a
single
traveler
was
given
me
by
one
of
the
rothschilds
whom
i
brought
from
chicago
to
frisco
but
this
has
been
largely
surpassed
several
times
in
car
tips
or
trips
the
knights
templar
one
of
whose
cars
i
had
charge
of
between
denver
and
boston
made
up
a
purse
of
and
presented
it
to
me
with
the
compliments
of
the
passengers
in
recognition
of
the
good
service
i
had
rendered
them
while
in
charge
of
the
private
car
of
general
manager
fisher
in
a
trip
through
california
and
mexico
fisher
made
up
a
purse
of
for
me
in
recognition
of
my
attentions
to
the
members
of
his
party
but
the
man
who
gave
me
cents
received
as
much
attention
from
me
as
the
man
who
gives
me
it
is
perhaps
all
he
can
afford
and
the
manner
in
which
he
gives
it
often
makes
up
for
the
smallness
of
the
tip

he
presses

has

there
is

a

tourist
sleeper
which
differs
from

sleeper
only
in
a
slight
difference
in
the
furnishings
the
service
is
the
same
but
the
cost
of
a
berth
in

between

is
just
that
of

i
have
never
run
on

road
where
better
service
more
courteous
treatment
or
better

was
made

on

a

in
these
latter

when
progress
is
the
watchword
of
the
railroads
in
common
with
the
other
industries

no
expense
or
pains
are
spared
by
the
railroad
people
to
add

safety

convenience
of
the
traveling
public
until
now
it
is
about
as
safe
to

as
it
is
to
stay
at
home
and
not
much
if
any
more
expensive
but
in
spite
of
all
safeguards
adopted
by
the
railroads
a
wreck
occurs
once
in
a
while
the
same
as
accidents
occur
at
home
the
first
wreck
i
was
in
the
train
struck
a
split
switch
with
the
result
that
the
cars
turned
over
and
piled
up
in
a
ditch
that
happened
in
colorado
we
were
forced
to
crawl
out
through
the
windows
like
a
prairie
dog
out
of
his
hole
no
one
was
killed
but
the
passengers
were
all
pretty
well
shaken
up
and
somewhat
scared
as
soon
as
the
cars
got
comfortably
piled
up
and
the
passengers
were
able
to
speak
they
all
commenced
yelling
for
the
porter
but
at
that
particular
moment
the
porter
was
busy
rubbing
his
shins
and
assuring
himself
there
was
nothing
to
be
scared
about
the
passengers
at
such
times
are
apt
to
forget
that
the
porter
is
as
scared
as
they
are
and
has
forgotten
all
about
tips
and
such
commonplace
matters
as
that
but
after
he
gets
his
wits
about
him
he
loses
no
time
in
looking
after
his
flock
and
rendering
assistance
to
such
of
his
passengers
as
need
it
and
most
of
them
do
need
assistance
of
some
kind
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
be
assured
that
they
are
not
hurt
the
pullman
porter
of
today
must
be
a
very
versatile
sort
of
a
person
he
must
have
plenty
of
patience
be
a
good
judge
of
human
nature
quick
kind
and
observant
many
are
the
times
a
gouty
and
crusty
passenger
has
traveled
in
my
car
who
was
in
such
a
bad
humor
that
it
was
next
to
impossible
to
please
him
yet
before
he
had
ridden
a

with

i
had
him
in
good
humor
and
laughing
with
the
rest
of
the
passengers
laugh
and
the
whole
world
laughs
with
you
it
is
by
no
means
an
uncommon
thing
for
us
porters
to
be
called
upon
to
turn
nurse
for
sick
or
invalid
passengers
in
our
car
and
often
have
i
watched
by
the
bedside
of
a
sick
passenger
feeding
him
giving
him
medicine
bathing
him
and
in
fact
becoming
for
the
time
being
a
hospital
nurse
and
many
are
the
blessings
i
have
received
from
my
sick
passengers
both
men

i
have
eased

see

then
let
your
chest
swell
with
pride
that
you
are
an
american
the
pullman
tourist
sleeping
car
which
you
can
find
on
all
through
trains
of
the
different
railroads
throughout
the
united
states
are
to
the
traveler
of
moderate
means
what
the
pullman
car
is
to
the
millionaire
traveler
they
are
designed
for
the
comfort
and
convenience
of
the
traveling
public
to
whom
the
expenditure
of
a
dollar
more
or
less
is
a
matter
of
moment
and
who
can
not
afford
or
do
not
care
for
the
small
extra
show
and
tinsel
of
the
pullman
sleeping
car
but
whose
only
desire
is
to
make
their
journey
pleasant
comfortable
and
safe
this
they
can
do
as
well
in
the
tourist
as
in
the
standard
sleeping
car
there
is
a
difference
in
price
that
will
amount
to
a
tidy
sum
in
a
long
trip
across
the
continent
but
that
fact
does
not
always
appeal
to
the
traveling
public
as
i
have
had
the
poorest
of
passengers
in
the
palace
car
and
at
other
times
a
millionaire
and
his
family
would
be
my
passengers
in
the
tourist
cars
it
seems
to
me
a
matter
of
fact
and
one
which
my
long
experience
seems
to
verify
that
the
american
traveler
does
not
care
so
much
about
his
comfort
as
his
ability
to
get
there
as
the
average
american
traveler
is
always
in
a
hurry
and
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
he
is
thinking
more
about
the
speed
of
the
train
than
he
is
about
his
immediate
surroundings
or
the
price
he
had
paid
for
his
ticket
the
railroads
knowing
this
have
made
and
are
continually
making
every
effort
to
add
to
the
speed
and
safety
of
their
trains
but
traveling
long
distances
is
a
tiresome
matter
at
the
best
and
for
that
reason
the
railroads
are
continually
making
improvements
with
a
view
to
add
to
the
comfort
convenience
and
pleasure
of
the
traveler
and
in
a
journey
such
as
one
from
chicago
to
los
angeles
for
instance
there
is
no
time
to
stop
for
meals
and
such
trivial
matters
as
a
shave
as
time
is
money
lost
to
most
of
the
passengers
and
to
the
railroad
company
also
for
that
reason
the
sleeping
car
is
provided
that
you
may
sleep
with
as
much
comfort
as
if
you
were
in
your
own
home
the
dining
car
is
provided
to
furnish
you
a
good
meal
on
the
fly
and
at
a
price
that
all
can
afford
the
library
and
drawing
room
cars
are
provided
where
you
can
make
yourself
as
comfortable
as
you
can
in
your
own
house
the
porter
will
get
your
morning
paper
furnish
you
with
writing
materials
or
your
morning
high
ball
and
look
after
you
like
a
hen
after
her
brood
but
on
all
railroads
there
are
rules
governing
the
passengers
as
well
as
the
employees
the
same
as
there
are
in
all
lines
of
business
a
passenger
may
not
for
instance
smoke
in
the
body
of
the
pullman
car
but
must
retire
to
the
drawing
room
or
his
stateroom
as
an
instance
in
point
i
had
corbett
for
a
passenger
in
my
car
between
ogden
and
chicago
a
gentleman
who
was
at
that
time
in
the
height
of
his
career
and
naturally
thought
he
owned
the
earth
or
a
large
part
of
it
at
any
rate
he
came
in
the
sleeper
from
the
dining
car
lit
a
cigar
propped
his
feet
upon
the
opposite
seat
and
prepared
for
a
comfortable
smoke
but
it
was
against
the
rules
to
smoke
in
that
part
of
the
car
so
i
approached
him
and
politely
requested
him
not
to
smoke
in
that
part
of
the
car
he
regarded
me
a
few
moments
and
with
a
sneer
said
so
you
are
pullman
are
you
i
told
him
i
was
not
pullman
but
i
was
in
charge
of
one
of
pullman
cars
and
for
that
reason
i
was
a
representative
of
pullman
and
that
it
was
strictly
against
the
rules
to
smoke
in
that
part
of
the
car
and
that
if
he
wished
to
smoke
he
would
have
to
go
to
the
drawing
room
he
went
but
the
sleeping
car
conductor
who
had
watched
the
incident
told
me
i
had
better
look
out
or
corbett
would
have
my
scalp
i
told
the
conductor
i
was
not
scared
and
that
if
corbett
had
gotten
out
i
would
have
thrown
him
out
all
of
which
i
meant
but
the
conductor
shook
his
head
and
said
to
look
out
sure
enough
the
matter
was
reported
to
the
superintendent
but
that
official
on
hearing
the
facts
in
the
matter
said
i
had
done
perfectly
right
and
what
i
was
paid
to
do
it
is
necessary
that
all
passengers
as
well
as
all
employees
shall
observe
the
rules
of
the
company
for
the
benefit
safety
and
enjoyment
of
all
the
passengers
and
employees
alike
all
the
railroad
men
i
have
met
from
the
president
down
have
all
proved
themselves
jolly
good
fellows
kind
considerate
and
always
ready
to
render
assistance
and
service
to
those
in
need
but
at
the
same
time
they
are
strict
about
the
rules
and
discipline
thoroughly
understanding
their
business
themselves
they
insist
on
the
beginner
obeying
instructions
and
the
laws
of
the
road
because
on
that
depends
the
lives
of
hundreds
of
people
and
the
value
of
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
property
and
for
the
same
reason
they
are
expending
thousands
of
dollars
annually
in
new
appliances
inventions
and
equipment
that
will
add
to
the
saving
of
time
or
insure
the
safety
of
the
traveler
among
the
new
inventions
adopted
by
the
modern
railroads
are
the
block
system
which
makes
collisions
between
two
trains
approaching
each
other
on
the
same
track
almost
an
impossibility
if
the
engineer
is
awake
and
attentive
to
business
under
this
system
when
the
trains
approach
a
certain
distance
of
each
other
a
bell
is
rung
in
the
cab
of
each
locomotive
simultaneously
and
will
continue
to
ring
until
the
danger
is
over
this
with
the
powerful
electric
headlights
now
used
with
which
the
roadbed
is
lit
up
for
a
distance
of
five
miles
makes
a
collision
almost
impossible
while
the
air
brakes
heavy
rails
solid
roadbed
doing
away
with
the
sharp
curves
and
heavy
grades
all
add
to
the
safety
of
the
passengers
and
the
saving
of
many
miles
in
travel
and
many
precious
moments
it
has
always
seemed
strange
to
me
that
so
many
americans
rush
off
to
europe
and
foreign
countries
every
year
in
search
of
health
and
pleasure
or
to
climb
the
alps
in
switzerland
and
to
view
the
scenery
of
the
old
world
when
our
own
north
america
the
new
world
offers
so
many
better
opportunities
to
study
dame
nature
in
all
her
phases
and
i
always
say
to
the
traveling
american
see
america
how
many
of
you
have
done
so
only
those
who
have
seen
this
grand
country
of

justly
appreciate

grandeur
of
our
mountains

grand

on
the
vast
volume
of

carried
on

the
outside

country
homes

the

then
speculate
on
the
changes
that
have
been
wrought
in
the
course
of
the
short
time
since

walking
beside

seeking
the
promised
land
breaking
a
trail
for
the
generations
that
were
to
come
after
him
as
you
are
coming
now

of
the
railroad
men
under
whom
i
have
served
george
pullman
the
town
of
pullman
american
railroads
lead
the
world
a
few
figures
among
the
large
number
of
railroad
men
i
have
served
under
and
worked
with
during
the
fifteen
years
i
have
been
on
the
road
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
recall
the
names
of
a
few
with
whom
i
was
more
intimately
acquainted
and
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
many
favors
given
and
courtesies
extended
and
the
pleasant
duty
devolves
on
me
to
mention
the
always
courteous
obliging
and
most
competent
head
of
the
pullman
department
in
denver
runnells
and
his
assistant
wright
who
sent
me
out
on
my
first
run
in
next
comes
the
well
known
name
of
district
superintendent
smith
who
one
year
later
sent
me
out
on
the
run
that
marked
the
beginning
of
my
pullman
service
to
smith
more
than
to
any
other
railroad
man
i
am
indebted
for
advice
counsel
and
countless
favors
shown
me
while
i
was
in
the
service
in
the
department
over
which
he
presided
so
long
i
always
found
him
courteous
and
obliging
and
never
too
busy
to
listen
or
to
give
a
kind
word
of
advice
or
counsel
to
all
who
approached
him
on
company
business
or
on
the
private
affairs
of
the
employees
of
the
road
i
had
charge
of
a
car
for
several
years
in
his
territory
and
many
a
time
i
have
had
him
for
a
passenger
and
at
such
times
he
seemed
more
like
an
old
friend
than
he
did
like
the
superintendent
of
the
pullman
service
i
next
transferred
to
the
ogden
division
here
i
met
and
came
to
know
very
well
superintendent
baker
and
his
assistant
johnnie
searce
and
to
these
two
gentlemen
i
am
also
indebted
for
many
favors
shown
me
as
they
tried
in
every
way
possible
to
make
my
employment
pleasant
and
profitable
while
i
was
in
their
territory
i
was
sent
out
on
runs
that
covered
the
greater
portions
of
the
united
states
and
while
on
some
of
my
longer
runs
i
often
started
from
and
returned
to
stations
in
different
districts
under
different
superintendents
but
i
always
looked
on
ogden
as
my
home
station
and
superintendent
baker
as
my
chief
until
another
superintendent
was
given
charge
of
the
district
and
i
transferred
to
salt
lake
and
started
to
run
on
senator
clark
new
road
the
a
road
between
salt
lake
and
los
angeles
under
the
superintendency
of
twining
and
his
assistant
cotten
and
these
gentlemen
also
during
the
time
i
have
been
with
them
have
shown
me
every
favor
and
consideration
which
goes
far
towards
making
my
work
a
pleasure
in
this
connection
also
i
mention
the
names
of
jim
donohue
traveling
engineer
smith
trainmaster
and
randoff
morris
and
jos
jones
special
agents
all
jolly
railroad
men
from
a
to
izard
during
my
fifteen
years
service
i
have
met
and
served
under
many
different
superintendents
and
to
mention
the
names
of
them
all
would
require
a
separate
volume
but
i
will
always
hold
them
in
kindly
remembrance
as
they
all
have
without
exception
been
kindness
itself
to
me
another
old
friend
i
have
recently
met
on
the
steel
road
is
william
blood
at
present
one
of
the
popular
conductors
on
the
san
pedro
los
angeles
salt
lake
railroad
in
the
early
seventies
billy
was
one
of
the
best
cowboys
ranging
over
the
western
cattle
country
he
was
with
me
on
many
of
the
old
trails
and
in
many
a
tight
place
and
like
myself
he
always
came
out
right
side
up
with
care
and
none
the
worse
for
wear
gillett
at
present
general
passenger
agent
of
the
salt
lake
road
and
one
of
the
best
known
and
most
popular
railroad
men
of
the
west
is
another
friend
of
the
old
days
it
is
my
pleasure
to
meet
often
now
i
first
met
him
under
the
following
circumstances
i
think
it
was
in
the
year
along
in
the
fall
i
had
been
up
the
trail
with
some
cattle
and
was
returning
through
wyoming
en
route
to
arizona
i
had
been
riding
hard
all
day
and
as
it
began
to
get
dark
i
sighted
a
small
station
on
the
main
line
of
the
union
pacific
and
i
concluded
to
give
it
a
passing
call
out
of
curiosity
as
i
drew
near
i
noticed
several
customers
hanging
around
in
a
suspicious
manner
and
i
at
once
concluded
that
they
were
robbers
there
for
the
purpose
of
holding
up
the
station
events
immediately
following
proved
that
i
was
right
they
had
not
noticed
me
and
they
proceeded
to
hold
up
the
agent
in
true
western
style
but
that
they
had
caught
a
tartar
was
evidenced
by
the
rattle
of
the
agent
artillery
of
course
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
me
to
miss
such
fun
so
not
waiting
for
an
invitation
i
lost
no
time
in
getting
my
own
in
active
operation
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
what
was
left
of
those
greasers
were
making
tracks
for
the
nearest
state
line
while
a
youngster
with
a
smoking
in
his
fist
was
shaking
hands
with
me
and
trying
to
say
something
about
my
saving
his
life
i
took
a
shine
to
him
at
once
on
account
of
his
pluck
and
our
friendship
thus
begun
has
lasted
through
the
years
until
now
time
and
fate
have
thrown
us
both
together
on
the
same
line
of
railroad
the
railroad
men
as
a
class
are
the
most
jovial
set
of
men
one
could
find
in
any
profession
well
educated
broad
minded
and
always
considerate
of
others
and
at
the
same
time
they
know
their
business
thoroughly
as
they
have
to
serve
many
years
as
apprentices
so
to
speak
in
railroading
before
they
are
given
places
of
trust
and
responsibility
and
the
man
who
has
reached
the
position
of
president
or
general
manager
of
a
railroad
system
has
learned
pretty
much
all
there
is
to
be
learned
about
the
iron
horse
and
the
steel
road
and
they
use
that
knowledge
in
providing
for
the
safety
and
comfort
of
the
millions
of
lives
that
are
annually
intrusted
to
their
keeping
the
general
manager
is
responsible
not
only
for
the
lives
of
the
traveling
public
but
of
the
army
or
railroad
employees
under
him
and
he
is
supposed
to
know
everything
and
must
always
be
prepared
to
do
the
right
thing
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
and
as
in
many
cases
life
and
death
depend
on
it
he
must
know
how
illustration
the
close
of
my
railroad
career
a
college
education
does
not
make
a
railroad
manager
although
it
may
help
to
do
so
he
in
a
great
measure
gets
his
education
in
the
school
of
experience
and
in
some
cases
it
is
a
hard
school
and
the
most
exacting
of
all
schools
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
a
school
in
which
one
can
learn
anything
under
the
sun
and
learn
it
well
and
in
these
days
of
the
twentieth
century
activity
and
progress
it
is
the
man
who
knows
how
to
do
things
that
makes
the
world
move
and
after
boiling
everything
down
there
is
left
in
the
pot
two
undisputable
facts
they
are
that
the
railroad
men
cause
the
world
to
move
by
knowing
how
to
do
things
the
other
is
that
the
railroad
men
move
the
people
who
live
in
the
world
thus
they
move
things
all
around
and
they
are
continually
on
the
move
themselves
which
goes
to
prove
that
they
are
different
from
many
other
people
inasmuch
as
they
practice
what
they
preach
and
from
these
men
of
all
classes
from
the
president
down
i
have
received
courtesies
and
the
kindest
of
consideration
and
these
pleasant
associations
are
pleasant
memories
to
me
and
will
always
remain
so
it
was
my
pleasure
to
meet
and
to
chat
with
george
pullman
the
father
of
the
sleeping
car
several
times
and
i
found
him
to
be
a
fine
man
in
every
sense
of
the
word
always
approachable
and
with
always
a
kind
word
for
every
one
of
the
large
army
of
his
employees
that
he
met
on
his
travels
and
he
always
tried
to
meet
them
all
it
was
also
my
pleasure
to
meet
his
two
boys
who
are
veritable
chips
of
the
old
block
one
of
the
legends
connected
with
the
western
mining
history
is
that
early
in
the
george
pullman
was
a
poor
prospector
and
had
secured
a
lease
on
a
piece
of
mining
ground
in
colorado
and
that
he
formed
the
idea
of
the
sleeping
car
from
the
tiers
of
bunks
in
the
miners
lodging
house
bunk
houses
they
are
called
however
that
may
be
pullman
has
been
the
recipient
of
many
a
blessing
from
the
weary
traveler
and
the
idea
whatever
it
was
that
led
him
to
invent
the
sleeping
car
that
has
proved
such
a
comfort
to
the
traveler
of
today
deserves
to
go
down
in
history
as
the
greatest
idea
that
ever
came
from
the
place
where
ideas
come
from
it
has
been
my
pleasure
to
visit
all
the
large
shops
of
the
pullman
company
including
the
town
of
pullman
which
is
a
city
named
after
pullman
and
was
owned
by
him
principally
and
the
large
number
of
men
employed
in
his
shops
there
the
town
contains
fine
churches
and
public
buildings
a
splendid
library
and
reading
rooms
and
amusement
halls
and
while
i
was
there
i
failed
to
see
a
single
saloon
it
seems
such
places
are
tabooed
there
the
shops
are
the
finest
in
this
country
containing
all
the
modern
machinery
of
the
finest
kind
and
the
men
employed
there
are
all
past
masters
of
their
trades
here
are
built
all
the
finest
sleeping
cars
and
many
of
the
finest
special
cars
and
railway
cars
seen
on
the
railroads
of
this
country
in
addition
there
is
also
a
very
large
amount
of
repairing
done
as
soon
as
anything
goes
wrong
with
a
pullman
car
it
is
at
once
sent
into
the
shops
for
repair
and
soon
comes
out
in
apple
pie
order
you
may
see
the
pullman
cars
all
over
this
country
where
there
is
a
steel
road
and
other
countries
have
their
eyes
on
the
mof
late
and
in
the
near
future
it
will
be
possible
to
sleep
in
a
pullman
car
whether
you
are
traveling
in
england
france
sweden
or
china
they
are
a
good
thing
and
are
sure
to
be
pushed
or
rather
pulled
along
in
i
went
to
pullman
and
told
him
i
was
thinking
of
getting
the
porters
of
the
pullman
car
company
to
club
together
and
contribute
fifty
cents
per
month
apiece
for
the
purpose
of
investing
the
proceeds
in
land
in
view
of
eventually
owning
what
we
would
call
the
home
pullman
told
me
he
thought
that
a
good
idea
and
said
if
we
succeeded
in
buying
one
thousand
acres
of
land
he
would
erect
us
a
building
on
it
and
signed
a
statement
to
that
effect
i
then
went
to
work
and
communicated
with
all
the
divisions
of
the
pullman
company
presenting
this
proposition
to
the
porters
of
these
different
districts
but
only
succeeded
in
getting
about
subscribers
the
rest
of
them
refusing
to
go
into
such
a
proposition
some
of
them
saying
all
i
wanted
was
to
get
the
money
and
make
away
with
it
inasmuch
as
this
amount
was
to
be
sent
to
the
main
pullman
office
in
chicago
and
i
was
to
be
there
each
month
to
see
this
money
deposited
others
refused
to
go
into
it
upon
the
ground
that
they
were
liable
to
be
discharged
from
the
pullman
service
at
any
time
and
many
other
various
excuses
were
offered
there
were
many
of
the
pullman
conductors
however
who
promised
to
contribute
from
one
to
five
dollars
toward
this
enterprise
when
we
were
ready
to
purchase
the
land
my
object
was
to
have
a
home
and
hospital
with
adjoining
farming
land
for
the
benefit
of
old
and
disabled
porters
who
were
not
able
to
perform
their
duties
as
pullman
car
porters
had
this
been
accomplished
at
that
time
we
would
by
now
have
had
a
large
farm
and
a
house
and
hospital
connected
therewith
and
all
the
porters
who
are
now
unable
to
work
would
have
had
a
good
home
and
be
cared
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
i
hope
to
live
long
enough
to
yet
see
this
plan
become
a
reality
at
present
the
american
railway
leads
the
world
in
no
other
country
does
the
traveler
find
so
much
comfort
so
many
conveniences
so
much
pleasure
safety
and
speed
as
does
the
dweller
in
this
robust
young
country
belonging
to
our
uncle
samuel
at
the
present
time
there
are
in
the
united
states
upwards
of
two
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
miles
of
railroad
open
and
in
operation
not
to
mention
several
thousand
miles
now
building
and
projected
this
immense
mileage
is
divided
between
over
one
thousand
different
roads
while
in
there
were
only
different
railroads
with
a
total
mileage
of
miles
the
railroads
today
have
a
capital
back
of
them
amounting
to
over
and
they
pay
their
employees
wages
that
foot
up
over
annually
while
their
earnings
amount
to
the
tidy
sum
of
in
the
same
length
of
time
they
carry
somewhat
more
than
passengers
every
twelve
months
and
tons
of
freight
these
figures
do
not
include
the
several
million
tons
of
trunks
sachels
grips
hat
boxes
and
carpet
bags
that
the
average
traveler
considers
it
necessary
to
load
him
or
herself
down
with
on
starting
on
a
journey
of
any
distance
and
which
comes
in
such
large
quantities
sometimes
as
to
make
life
a
burden
for
us
porters
read
these
figures
again
dear
reader
they
are
a
conservative
estimate
of
the
business
transacted
by
the
railroads
of
this
fair
land
of
ours
you
can
count
a
million
can
you
count
a
billion
immense
is
it
it
seems
to
show
that
the
people
of
this
country
are
great
travelers
forever
on
the
move
yet
they
tell
us
this
is
a
country
of
homes
and
that
the
average
american
loves
his
home
and
home
life
above
all
things
these
figures
seem
to
show
there
are
a
few
people
who
hav
any
home
or
if
they
have
they
are
looking
for
one
they
like
better
which
like
the
will
of
the
wisp
evades
them
always
but
they
continue
to
shift
around
always
hopeful
never
satisfied
and
they
will
continue
to
shift
around
until
gabriel
blows
on
his
little
tin
horn
but
this
class
of
people
make
but
a
small
percentage
of
the
traveling
public
business
in
this
latter
day
of
strife
and
competition
makes
long
journeys
necessary
and
as
the
business
of
the
world
grows
apace
and
the
countries
of
the
earth
crowd
closer
together
in
the
struggle
for
the
almighty
dollar
there
will
be
need
of
more
railroads
to
make
the
globe
smaller
and
to
cut
off
the
hours
and
minutes
of
precious
time
that
means
money
to
the
man
of
today
and
as
a
man
makes
and
saves
money
so
will
he
spend
it
for
the
pleasure
of
himself
and
family
and
as
he
must
travel
to
find
pleasure
there
must
be
railroads
to
carry
him
and
hence
these
figures
i
write
now
will
look
insignificant
beside
the
magnificent
total
that
will
be
put
before
the
reader
of
that
day
because
if
they
increase
in
the
next
century
as
they
have
in
the
past
walking
will
be
out
of
fashion
and
every
body
will
ride
and
i
hope

chapter

a
few
reminiscences
of
the
range
some
men
i
have
met
buffalo
bill
the
james
brothers
yellowstone
kelley
the
murder
of
buck
cannon
by
bill
woods
the
suicide
of
jack
zimick
it
has
now
been
many
years
since
i
quit
the
range
and
as
my
mind
wanders
back
over
those
years
as
it
often
does
memories
both
pleasant
and
sad
pass
in
review
and
it
is
but
fitting
that
i
record
a
few
of
them
as
a
final
to
the
history
of
my
life
which
has
been
so
full
of
action
which
is
but
natural
as
the
men
of
those
days
were
men
of
action
they
had
to
be
and
probably
their
actions
were
not
all
good
that
i
freely
admit
but
while
that
is
so
it
is
equally
so
that
their
actions
were
not
all
bad
far
from
it
and
in
the
history
of
the
frontier
there
is
recorded
countless
heroic
deeds
performed
deeds
and
actions
that
required
an
iron
nerve
self
denial
in
all
that
these
words
imply
the
sacrificing
of
one
life
to
save
the
life
of
a
stranger
or
a
friend
deeds
that
stamped
the
men
of
the
western
plains
as
men
worthy
to
be
called
men
and
while
not
many
of
them
would
shine
particularly
in
the
polite
society
of
today
or
among
the
of
gotham
yet
they
did
shine
big
and
bright
in
the
positions
and
at
a
time
when
men
lived
and
died
for
a
principle
and
in
the
line
of
duty
a
man
who
went
to
the
far
west
or
who
claimed
it
as
his
home
in
the
early
days
found
there
a
life
far
different
from
that
led
by
the
dude
of
fifth
avenue
there
a
man
work
was
to
be
done
and
a
man
life
to
be
lived
and
when
death
was
to
be
met
he
met
it
like
a
man
it
was
among
such
men
and
surroundings
that
i
spent
so
many
years
of
my
life
and
there
i
met
men
some
of
whom
are
famous
now
while
others
never
lived
long
enough
to
reach
the
pinnacle
of
fame
but
their
memory
is
held
no
less
sacred
by
the
men
who
knew
them
well
some
men
i
met
in
the
cattle
country
are
now
known
to
the
world
as
the
baddest
of
bad
men
yet
i
have
seen
these
men
perform
deeds
of
valor
self
sacrifice
and
kindness
that
would
cause
the
deeds
recorded
as
performed
by
gentlemen
in
ye
olden
time
when
knighthood
was
in
flower
to
look
insignificant
in
comparison
and
yet
these
men
lay
no
claim
to
the
title
of
gentlemen
they
were
just
plain
men
it
was
my
pleasure
to
meet
often
during
the
early
seventies
the
man
who
is
now
famous
in
the
old
world
and
the
new
world
buffalo
bill
william
cody
cowboy
ranger
hunter
scout
and
showman
a
man
who
carried
his
life
in
his
hands
day
and
night
in
the
wild
country
where
duty
called
and
has
often
bluffed
the
grim
reaper
death
to
a
standstill
and
is
living
now
hale
hearty
and
famous
others
who
are
equally
famous
but
in
another
way
are
the
james
brothers
jesse
and
frank
i
met
them
often
in
the
old
days
on
the
range
and
became
very
well
acquainted
with
them
and
many
others
of
their
band
their
names
are
recorded
in
history
as
the
most
famous
robbers
of
the
new
world
but
to
us
cowboys
of
the
cattle
country
who
knew
them
well
they
were
true
men
brave
kind
generous
and
considerate
and
while
they
were
robbers
and
bandits
yet
what
they
took
from
the
rich
they
gave
to
the
poor
the
james
brothers
band
stole
thousands
of
dollars
yet
jesse
was
a
poor
man
when
he
fell
a
victim
to
the
bullet
of
a
cowardly
traitorous
assassin
and
frank
james
is
a
poor
man
today
what
then
did
they
do
with
the
thousands
they
stole
the
answer
is
simple
they
gave
it
away
to
those
who
were
in
need
that
is
why
they
had
so
many
friends
and
the
officers
of
the
law
found
it
so
hard
to
capture
them
and
if
they
were
robbers
by
what
name
are
we
to
call
some
of
the
great
trusts
corporations
and
brokers
who
have
for
years
been
robbing
the
people
of
this
country
some
of
them
i
am
glad
to
say
are
now
behind
prison
bars
still
others
are
even
now
piling
up
the
dollars
that
they
have
been
and
are
still
stealing
from
the
american
people
and
who
on
account
of
these
same
dollars
are
looked
up
to
respected
and
are
honored
members
of
society
and
the
only
difference
between
them
and
the
james
brothers
is
that
the
james
brothers
stole
from
the
rich
and
gave
to
the
poor
while
these
respected
members
of
society
steal
from
the
poor
to
make
the
rich
richer
and
which
of
them
think
you
reader
will
get
the
benefit
of
the
judgment
when
the
final
day
arrives
and
all
men
appear
before
the
great
white
throne
in
final
judgment
jessie
james
was
a
true
man
a
loving
son
and
husband
true
to
his
word
true
to
his
principles
and
true
to
his
comrads
and
his
friends
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
frank
james
quite
recently
on
the
road
while
he
was
en
route
to
the
coast
with
his
theatrical
company
and
enjoyed
a
pleasant
chat
with
him
he
knew
me
and
recalled
many
incidents
of
the
old
days
and
happenings
in
no
man
land
quite
a
different
sort
of
man
was
yellowstone
kelley
government
scout
hunter
and
trapper
he
was
one
of
the
men
who
helped
to
make
frontier
history
and
open
up
the
pathless
wilds
to
the
march
of
civilization
he
was
in
the
employ
of
the
government
as
a
scout
and
guide
when
i
first
met
him
and
thereafter
during
our
many
wanderings
over
the
country
i
with
my
cattle
he
with
uncle
sam
soldiers
or
on
a
lone
scout
we
often
bumped
up
against
each
other
and
these
meetings
are
among
my
treasured
memories
he
was
a
man
who
knew
the
country
better
than
he
knew
his
own
mother
absolutely
fearless
kind
and
generous
to
a
fault
he
was
the
sort
of
a
man
that
once
you
meet
him
you
could
never
forget
him
and
us
boys
who
knew
him
well
considered
him
the
chief
of
all
the
government
scouts
of
that
day
i
also
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
kit
carson
in
arizona
and
nearly
all
the
government
scouts
hunters
and
trappers
of
the
western
country
and
they
can
all
be
described
in
one
sentence
they
were
men
whom
it
was
a
pleasure
and
an
honor
to
know
billie
the
kid
was
another
sort
of
a
man
and
there
has
never
been
another
man
like
him
and
i
do
think
there
ever
will
be
again
writers
claim
that
he
was
a
man
all
bad
this
i
doubt
as
i
knew
him
well
and
i
have
known
him
to
do
deeds
of
kindness
he
had
many
traits
that
go
to
make
a
good
man
but
fate
and
circumstances
were
against
the
kid
yet
i
know
he
always
remembered
a
kindness
done
him
and
he
never
forgave
an
enemy
i
have
rode
by
his
side
many
a
long
mile
and
it
is
hard
to
believe
he
was
as
bad
as
he
is
pictured
to
be
but
the
facts
are
against
him
and
when
his
career
was
ended
by
the
bullet
from
sheriff
colt
the
world
was
better
off
likewise
were
some
men
who
stood
in
mortal
fear
of
the
kid
and
i
suppose
they
had
good
reason
to
be
afraid
as
the
kid
always
kept
his
word
during
my
employment
with
the
duval
outfit
and
pete
gallingan
i
often
made
trips
on
the
trail
with
herds
of
cattle
and
horses
belonging
to
other
ranch
owners
and
on
these
trips
many
incidents
occurred
amusing
and
sad
the
following
incident
happened
in
the
fall
of
when
i
went
up
the
trail
with
the
half
circle
box
brand
outfit
belonging
to
arthur
gorman
and
company
we
had
a
small
herd
of
horses
to
take
to
dodge
city
where
we
arrived
after
an
uneventful
trip
and
after
disposing
of
the
horses
we
started
out
to
do
the
town
as
usual
but
in
this
we
met
an
unexpected
snag
our
bookkeeper
jack
zimick
got
into
a
poker
game
and
lost
all
the
money
he
had
to
pay
the
cowboys
off
with
which
amounted
to
about
two
thousand
dollars
and
also
about
the
same
amount
of
the
boss
money
the
boys
had
about
one
and
a
half
years
wages
coming
to
them
and
consequently
they
were
in
a
rather
bad
humor
when
they
heard
this
bit
of
news
they
at
once
got
after
zimick
so
hard
that
he
took
me
and
went
to
kinsely
where
gorman
was
arriving
there
he
went
to
the
smith
saloon
to
get
a
room
as
smith
ran
a
rooming
house
over
his
saloon
and
it
was
the
custom
for
all
the
cattle
men
to
make
it
their
headquarters
when
in
the
city
here
he
met
gorman
and
we
were
sitting
around
the
room
and
zimick
had
only
told
gorman
a
few
things
when
all
of
a
sudden
zimick
drew
his
colt
revolver
remarking
as
he
did
so
here
is
the
last
of
jack
zimick
he
placed
the
gun
to
his
head
and
before
we
could
reach
him
he
pulled
the
trigger
and
his
brains
were
scattered
all
over
the
room
they
arrested
gorman
and
myself
and
held
up
for
a
short
time
until
things
could
be
explained
gorman
was
very
much
overcome
by
the
act
as
jack
was
one
of
his
best
men
and
had
been
with
him
a
long
time
gorman
had
the
body
sent
to
zimick
friends
in
boston
and
he
personally
paid
off
all
the
boys
taking
the
money
out
of
his
own
pocket
to
do
so
but
when
the
boys
heard
of
jack
rash
deed
they
said
they
would
rather
have
lost
every
dollar
they
had
rather
than
have
had
jack
kill
himself
as
he
was
a
favorite
among
all
the
cowboys
especially
so
among
those
in
gorman
employ
zimick
had
been
in
the
employ
of
gorman
and
company
for
over
ten
years
and
he
was
gorman
right
hand
man
and
this
was
the
first
time
he
ever
went
wrong
jack
did
not
have
the
nerve
to
face
his
comrades
again
and
so
i
suppose
he
concluded
that
his
colt
was
the
only
friend
he
had
to
help
him
out
of
it
in
may
i
was
in
durango
colorado
and
chanced
to
be
in
a
saloon
on
main
street
where
a
lot
of
us
boys
were
together
among
them
being
buck
cannon
and
bill
woods
the
drinks
had
been
circulating
around
pretty
freely
when
cannon
and
woods
got
into
a
dispute
over
niece
to
whom
woods
had
been
paying
attention
much
against
that
young
lady
wish
after
some
hot
words
between
the
men
woods
drew
his
colt
revolver
remarking
as
he
did
so
i
will
kill
you
and
in
raising
it
his
finger
must
have
slipped
as
his
gun
went
off
and
the
bullet
hit
a
glass
of
beer
in
the
hand
of
a
man
who
was
in
the
act
of
raising
it
to
his
lips
scattering
the
broken
glass
all
over
the
room
then
passing
through
the
ceiling
of
the
saloon
in
an
instant
woods
threw
three
bullets
into
cannon
remarking
as
he
did
so
i
will
kill
you
for
your
niece
is
my
heart
delight
and
i
will
die
for
her
buck
cannon
dying
words
were
boys
do
let
a
good
man
die
with
his
boots
on
along
in
the
spring
of
we
sent
to
dodge
city
kansas
with
a
herd
of
cattle
for
the
market
and
after
they
were
disposed
of
we
boys
turned
our
attention
to
the
search
of
amusement
some
of
the
boys
made
for
the
nearest
saloon
and
card
table
but
i
heard
there
was
to
be
a
dance
at
bill
smith
dance
hall
and
in
company
with
some
of
the
other
boys
decided
to
attend
there
was
always
quite
a
large
number
of
cowboys
in
dodge
city
at
this
time
of
the
year
so
we
were
not
surprised
to
find
the
dance
hall
crowded
on
our
arrival
there
smith
place
occupied
a
large
low
frame
building
down
by
the
railroad
tracks
on
the
south
we
found
many
old
acquaintances
there
among
them
being
kiowa
bill
a
colored
cattle
man
and
ranch
owner
of
kansas
whose
ranch
was
on
kiowa
creek
i
had
met
him
several
times
but
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
him
in
a
couple
of
years
but
as
he
was
dancing
with
a
young
lady
i
could
not
get
to
speak
with
him
at
once
so
i
looked
up
a
wall
flower
and
proceeded
to
enjoy
myself
we
had
not
been
dancing
long
when
i
became
aware
of
a
commotion
over
near
the
bar
and
all
eyes
were
turned
in
that
direction
i
soon
ascertained
the
cause
of
the
commotion
to
be
a
dispute
between
kiowa
bill
and
bill
smith
the
proprietor
of
the
place
who
was
behind
the
bar
kiowa
bill
after
finishing
the
dance
with
his
fair
partner
took
her
to
the
bar
to
treat
her
smith
who
was
tending
bar
refused
to
serve
her
saying
she
had
enough
already
kiowa
bill
told
smith
he
kiowa
bill
was
paying
for
what
she
wanted
to
drink
and
that
he
wanted
her
to
get
what
she
wanted
smith
said
no
she
could
not
have
anything
more
to
drink
as
she
had
too
much
already
at
this
kiowa
bill
reached
over
the
bar
and
struck
smith
over
the
head
with
a
whiskey
bottle
partly
stunning
him
but
he
recovered
in
an
instant
and
grabbed
his
colt
kiowa
bill
doing
the
same
and
both
guns
spoke
as
one
smith
fell
dead
behind
the
bar
with
a
bullet
through
his
heart
kiowa
bill
rolled
against
the
bar
and
slowly
sank
to
the
floor
and
was
dead
when
we
reached
him
the
next
day
they
were
hauled
to
the
cemetery
laying
side
by
side
in
the
same
wagon
and
were
buried
side
by
side
in
the
same
grave
kiowa
bill
had
made
his
will
a
short
time
before
and
it
was
found
on
his
body
when
he
was
killed
i
had
known
kiowa
bill
for
several
years
and
was
present
at
a
shooting
scrape
he
had
two
years
before
down
in
texas
near
the
arizona
line
at
one
of
the
big
round
ups
there
in
myself
and
quite
a
crowd
of
the
other
boys
were
in
camp
eating
our
dinner
when
kiowa
bill
rode
up
he
had
been
looking
after
his
own
cattle
as
he
owned
over
two
thousand
head
himself
one
of
the
boys
in
our
party
who
did
not
like
bill
there
being
a
feud
between
them
for
sometime
on
noticing
bill
approaching
remarked
if
that
fellow
comes
here
i
will
rope
him
true
to
his
word
as
bill
rode
up
the
cowboy
threw
his
lariat
kiowa
bill
seeing
the
movement
threw
the
rope
off
at
the
same
time
springing
down
on
the
opposite
side
of
his
horse
illustration
with
the
general
securities
company
the
cowboy
enraged
at
his
failure
to
rope
bill
shouted
i
will
fight
you
from
the
point
of
a
jack
knife
to
the
point
of
a
at
the
same
time
reaching
for
his
which
was
in
the
holster
on
his
saddle
which
was
lying
on
the
ground
a
short
distance
away
at
that
kiowa
bill
fired
striking
the
cowboy
in
the
neck
breaking
it
bill
then
sprang
in
the
saddle
and
put
spurs
to
his
horse
in
an
effort
to
get
away
several
of
the
cowboys
commenced
shooting
after
bill
who
returned
the
fire
one
of
the
cowboys
squatting
down
and
holding
his
with
both
hands
in
an
effort
to
get
a
better
aim
on
bill
received
a
bullet
in
the
leg
from
bill
revolver
that
knocked
him
over
backwards
and
caused
him
to
turn
a
couple
of
somersaults
bill
got
away
and
went
to
new
york
he
was
later
arrested
in
louis
and
brought
back
at
his
trial
he
went
free
as
it
was
shown
that
he
killed
the
cowboy
in
and
his
appearance
at
the
dance
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
him
since
the
scrape
in
texas
kiowa
bill
was
of
a
peaceful
disposition
and
always
refrained
from
bothering
with
others
but
if
others
bothered
with
him
they
were
liable
to
get
killed
as
kiowa
bill
allowed
no
one
to
monkey
with
him
such
was
life
on
the
western
ranges
when
i
rode
them
and
such
were
my
comrades
and
surroundings
humor
and
tragedy
in
the
midst
of
life
we
were
in
death
but
above
all
shown
the
universal
manhood
the
wild
and
free
life
the
boundless
plains
the
countless
thousands
of
long
horn
steers
the
wild
fleet
footed
mustangs
the
buffalo
and
other
game
the
indians
the
delight
of
living
and
the
fights
against
death
that
caused
every
nerve
to
tingle
and
the
every
day
communion
with
men
whose
minds
were
as
broad
as
the
plains
they
roamed
and
whose
creed
was
every
man
for
himself
and
every
friend
for
each
other
and
with
each
other
till
the
end
another
friend
of
the
old
times
is

of
the

mines
chats
with
these
good
people
of
the
cattle
range
bring
back
reminiscences
of
the
past
that
would
fill
volumes
but
space
and
time
in
these
days
of
hustle
and
bustle
are
but
dreams
and
the
world
is
full
of
them
now
i

are
always
extremely
kind
to
me
and
the
appreciation
i
feel
for
the
kindnesses
shown
me
will
be
fully
rewarded
as
i
stop
to
ponder
over
the
days
of
old
so
full
of
adventure
and
excitement
health
and
happiness
love
and
sorrow
is
it
a
wonder
that
some
of
us
are
alive
to
tell
the
tale
one
moment
we
are
rejoicing
that
we
are
alive
the
next
we
are
so
near
the
jaws
of
death
that
it
seems
it
would
be
almost
a
miracle
that
our
lives
be
saved
life
today
on
the
cattle
range
is
almost
another
epoch
laws
have
been
enacted
in

which
forbid
all
