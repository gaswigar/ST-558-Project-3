preface
permit
me
in
the
first
place
to
anticipate
the
disappointment
of
any
student
who
opens
this
book
with
the
idea
of
finding
wrinkles
on
how
to
draw
faces
trees
clouds
or
what
not
short
cuts
to
excellence
in
drawing
or
any
of
the
tricks
so
popular
with
the
drawing
masters
of
our
grandmothers
and
still
dearly
loved
by
a
large
number
of
people
no
good
can
come
of
such
methods
for
there
are
no
short
cuts
to
excellence
but
help
of
a
very
practical
kind
it
is
the
aim
of
the
following
pages
to
give
although
it
may
be
necessary
to
make
a
greater
call
upon
the
intelligence
of
the
student
than
these
victorian
methods
attempted
it
was
not
until
some
time
after
having
passed
through
the
course
of
training
in
two
of
our
chief
schools
of
art
that
the
author
got
any
idea
of
what
drawing
really
meant
what
was
taught
was
the
faithful
copying
of
a
series
of
objects
beginning
with
the
simplest
forms
such
as
cubes
cones
cylinders
an
excellent
system
to
begin
with
at
present
in
danger
of
some
neglect
after
which
more
complicated
objects
in
plaster
of
paris
were
attempted
and
finally
copies
of
the
human
head
and
figure
posed
in
suspended
animation
and
supported
by
blocks
in
so
far
as
this
was
accurately
done
all
this
mechanical
training
of
eye
and
hand
was
excellent
but
it
was
not
enough
and
when
with
an
eye
trained
to
the
closest
mechanical
accuracy
the
author
visited
the
galleries
of
the
continent
and
studied
the
drawings
of
the
old
masters
it
soon
became
apparent
that
either
his
or
their
ideas
of
drawing
were
all
wrong
very
few
drawings
could
be
found
sufficiently
like
the
model
to
obtain
the
prize
at
either
of
the
great
schools
he
had
attended
luckily
there
was
just
enough
modesty
left
for
him
to
realise
that
possibly
they
were
in
some
mysterious
way
right
and
his
own
training
in
some
way
lacking
and
so
he
set
to
work
to
try
and
climb
the
long
uphill
road
that
separates
mechanically
accurate
drawing
from
artistically
accurate
drawing
now
this
journey
should
have
been
commenced
much
earlier
and
perhaps
it
was
due
to
his
own
stupidity
that
it
was
not
but
it
was
with
a
vague
idea
of
saving
some
students
from
such
and
possibly
straightening
out
some
of
the
path
that
he
accepted
the
invitation
to
write
this
book
in
writing
upon
any
matter
of
experience
such
as
art
the
possibilities
of
misunderstanding
are
enormous
and
one
shudders
to
think
of
the
things
that
may
be
put
down
to
one
credit
owing
to
such
misunderstandings
it
is
like
writing
about
the
taste
of
sugar
you
are
only
likely
to
be
understood
by
those
who
have
already
experienced
the
flavour
by
those
who
have
not
the
wildest
interpretation
will
be
put
upon
your
words
the
written
word
is
necessarily
confined
to
the
things
of
the
understanding
because
only
the
understanding
has
written
language
whereas
art
deals
with
ideas
of
a
different
mental
texture
which
words
can
only
vaguely
suggest
however
there
are
a
large
number
of
people
who
although
they
can
not
be
said
to
have
experienced
in
a
full
sense
any
works
of
art
have
undoubtedly
the
impelling
desire
which
a
little
direction
may
lead
on
to
a
fuller
appreciation
and
it
is
to
such
that
books
on
art
are
useful
so
that
although
this
book
is
primarily
addressed
to
working
students
it
is
hoped
that
it
may
be
of
interest
to
that
increasing
number
of
people
who
tired
with
the
rush
and
struggle
of
modern
existence
seek
refreshment
in
artistic
things
to
many
such
in
this
country
modern
art
is
still
a
closed
book
its
point
of
view
is
so
different
from
that
of
the
art
they
have
been
brought
up
with
that
they
refuse
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
whereas
if
they
only
took
the
trouble
to
find
out
something
of
the
point
of
view
of
the
modern
artist
they
would
discover
new
beauties
they
little
suspected
if
anybody
looks
at
a
picture
by
claude
monet
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
raphael
he
will
see
nothing
but
a
meaningless
jargon
of
wild
and
if
anybody
looks
at
a
raphael
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
claude
monet
he
will
no
doubt
only
see
hard
tinny
figures
in
a
setting
devoid
of
any
of
the
lovely
atmosphere
that
always
envelops
form
seen
in
nature
so
wide
apart
are
some
of
the
points
of
view
in
painting
in
the
treatment
of
form
these
differences
in
point
of
view
make
for
enormous
variety
in
the
work
so
that
no
apology
need
be
made
for
the
large
amount
of
space
occupied
in
the
following
pages
by
what
is
usually
dismissed
as
mere
theory
but
what
is
in
reality
the
first
essential
of
any
good
practice
in
drawing
to
have
a
clear
idea
of
what
it
is
you
wish
to
do
is
the
first
necessity
of
any
successful
performance
but
our
exhibitions
are
full
of
works
that
show
how
seldom
this
is
the
case
in
art
works
showing
much
ingenuity
and
ability
but
no
artistic
brains
pictures
that
are
little
more
than
school
studies
exercises
in
the
representation
of
carefully
or
carelessly
arranged
objects
but
cold
to
any
artistic
intention
at
this
time
particularly
some
principles
and
a
clear
intellectual
understanding
of
what
it
is
you
are
trying
to
do
are
needed
we
have
no
set
traditions
to
guide
us
the
times
when
the
student
accepted
the
style
and
traditions
of
his
master
and
blindly
followed
them
until
he
found
himself
are
gone
such
conditions
belonged
to
an
age
when
intercommunication
was
difficult
and
when
the
artistic
horizon
was
restricted
to
a
single
town
or
province
science
has
altered
all
that
and
we
may
regret
the
loss
of
local
colour
and
singleness
of
aim
this
growth
of
art
in
separate
compartments
produced
but
it
is
unlikely
that
such
conditions
will
occur
again
quick
means
of
transit
and
cheap
methods
of
reproduction
have
brought
the
art
of
the
whole
world
to
our
doors
where
formerly
the
artistic
food
at
the
disposal
of
the
student
was
restricted
to
the
few
pictures
in
his
vicinity
and
some
prints
of
others
now
there
is
scarcely
a
picture
of
note
in
the
world
that
is
not
known
to
the
average
student
either
from
personal
inspection
at
our
museums
and
loan
exhibitions
or
from
excellent
photographic
reproductions
not
only
european
art
but
the
art
of
the
east
china
and
japan
is
part
of
the
formative
influence
by
which
he
is
surrounded
not
to
mention
the
modern
science
of
light
and
colour
that
has
had
such
an
influence
on
technique
it
is
no
wonder
that
a
period
of
artistic
indigestion
is
upon
us
hence
the
student
has
need
of
sound
principles
and
a
clear
understanding
of
the
science
of
his
art
if
he
would
select
from
this
mass
of
material
those
things
which
answer
to
his
own
inner
need
for
artistic
expression
the
position
of
art
is
like
that
of
a
river
where
many
tributaries
meeting
at
one
point
suddenly
turn
the
steady
flow
to
turbulence
the
many
streams
jostling
each
other
and
the
different
currents
pulling
hither
and
thither
after
a
time
these
forces
will
adjust
themselves
to
the
altered
condition
and
a
larger
finer
stream
be
the
result
something
analogous
to
this
would
seem
to
be
happening
in
art
at
the
present
time
when
all
nations
and
all
schools
are
acting
and
reacting
upon
each
other
and
art
is
losing
its
national
characteristics
the
hope
of
the
future
is
that
a
larger
and
deeper
art
answering
to
the
altered
conditions
of
humanity
will
result
there
are
those
who
would
leave
this
scene
of
struggling
influences
and
away
up
on
some
bare
primitive
start
a
new
stream
begin
all
over
again
but
however
necessary
it
may
be
to
give
the
primitive
mountain
waters
that
were
the
start
of
all
the
streams
a
more
prominent
place
in
the
new
flow
onwards
it
is
unlikely
that
much
can
come
of
any
attempt
to
leave
the
turbulent
waters
go
backwards
and
start
again
they
can
only
flow
onwards
to
speak
more
plainly
the
complexity
of
modern
art
influences
may
make
it
necessary
to
call
attention
to
the
primitive
principles
of
expression
that
should
never
be
lost
sight
of
in
any
work
but
hardly
justifies
the
attitude
of
those
anarchists
in
art
who
would
flout
the
heritage
of
culture
we
possess
and
attempt
a
new
start
such
attempts
however
when
sincere
are
interesting
and
may
be
productive
of
some
new
vitality
adding
to
the
weight
of
the
main
stream
but
it
must
be
along
the
main
stream
along
lines
in
harmony
with
tradition
that
the
chief
advance
must
be
looked
for
although
it
has
been
felt
necessary
to
devote
much
space
to
an
attempt
to
find
principles
that
may
be
said
to
be
at
the
basis
of
the
art
of
all
nations
the
executive
side
of
the
question
has
not
been
neglected
and
it
is
hoped
that
the
logical
method
for
the
study
of
drawing
from
the
two
opposite
points
of
view
of
line
and
mass
here
advocated
may
be
useful
and
help
students
to
avoid
some
of
the
confusion
that
results

introduction
the
best
things
in
an
artist
work
are
so
much
a
matter
of
intuition
that
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
the
point
of
view
that
would
altogether
discourage
intellectual
inquiry
into
artistic
phenomena
on
the
part
of
the
artist
intuitions
are
shy
things
and
apt
to
disappear
if
looked
into
too
closely
and
there
is
undoubtedly
a
danger
that
too
much
knowledge
and
training
may
supplant
the
natural
intuitive
feeling
of
a
student
leaving
only
a
cold
knowledge
of
the
means
of
expression
in
its
place
for
the
artist
if
he
has
the
right
stuff
in
him
has
a
consciousness
in
doing
his
best
work
of
something
as
ruskin
has
said
not
in
him
but
through
him
he
has
been
as
it
were
but
the
agent
through
which
it
has
found
expression
talent
can
be
described
as
that
which
we
have
and
genius
as
that
which
has
us
now
although
we
may
have
little
control
over
this
power
that
has
us
and
although
it
may
be
as
well
to
abandon
oneself
unreservedly
to
its
influence
there
can
be
little
doubt
as
to
its
being
the
business
of
the
artist
to
see
to
it
that
his
talent
be
so
developed
that
he
may
prove
a
fit
instrument
for
the
expression
of
whatever
it
may
be
given
him
to
express
while
it
must
be
left
to
his
individual
temperament
to
decide
how
far
it
is
advisable
to
pursue
any
intellectual
analysis
of
the
elusive
things
that
are
the
true
matter
of
art
provided
the
student
realises
this
and
that
art
training
can
only
deal
with
the
perfecting
of
a
means
of
expression
and
that
the
real
matter
of
art
lies
above
this
and
is
beyond
the
scope
of
teaching
he
can
not
have
too
much
of
it
for
although
he
must
ever
be
a
child
before
the
influence
that
moves
him
if
it
is
not
with
the
knowledge
of
the
grown
man
that
he
takes
off
his
coat
and
approaches
the
craft
of
painting
or
drawing
he
will
be
poorly
equipped
to
make
them
a
means
of
conveying
to
others
in
adequate
form
the
things
he
may
wish
to
express
great
things
are
only
done
in
art
when
the
creative
instinct
of
the
artist
has
a
executive
faculty
at
its
disposal
of
the
two
divisions
into
which
the
technical
study
of
painting
can
be
divided
namely
form
and
colour
we
are
concerned
in
this
book
with
form
alone
but
before
proceeding
to
our
immediate
subject
something
should
be
said
as
to
the
nature
of
art
generally
not
with
the
ambition
of
arriving
at
any
final
result
in
a
short
chapter
but
merely
in
order
to
give
an
idea
of
the
point
of
view
from
which
the
following
pages
are
written
so
that
misunderstandings
may
be
avoided
the
variety
of
definitions
that
exist
justifies
some
inquiry
the
following
are
a
few
that
come
to
mind
art
is
nature
expressed
through
a
personality
but
what
of
architecture
or
music
then
there
is
art
is
the
expression
of
pleasure
in
work
but
this
does
not
apply
to
music
and
poetry
andrew
everything
which
we
distinguish
from
nature
seems
too
broad
to
catch
hold
of
while
an
action
by
means
of
which
one
man
having
experienced
a
feeling
intentionally
transmits
it
to
others
is
nearer
the
truth
and
covers
all
the
arts
but
seems
from
its
omitting
any
mention
of
rhythm
very
inadequate
now
the
facts
of
life
are
conveyed
by
our
senses
to
the
consciousness
within
us
and
stimulate
the
world
of
thought
and
feeling
that
constitutes
our
real
life
thought
and
feeling
are
very
intimately
connected
few
of
our
mental
perceptions
particularly
when
they
first
dawn
upon
us
being
unaccompanied
by
some
feeling
but
there
is
this
general
division
to
be
made
on
one
extreme
of
which
is
what
we
call
pure
intellect
and
on
the
other
pure
feeling
or
emotion
the
arts
i
take
it
are
a
means
of
giving
expression
to
the
emotional
side
of
this
mental
activity
intimately
related
as
it
often
is
to
the
more
purely
intellectual
side
the
more
sensual
side
of
this
feeling
is
perhaps
its
lowest
while
the
feelings
associated
with
the
intelligence
the
little
sensitivenesses
of
perception
that
escape
pure
intellect
are
possibly
its
noblest
experiences
pure
intellect
seeks
to
construct
from
the
facts
brought
to
our
consciousness
by
the
senses
an
accurately
measured
world
of
phenomena
uncoloured
by
the
human
equation
in
each
of
us
it
seeks
to
create
a
point
of
view
outside
the
human
standpoint
one
more
stable
and
accurate
unaffected
by
the
current
of
human
life
it
therefore
invents
mechanical
instruments
to
do
the
measuring
of
our
sense
perceptions
as
their
records
are
more
accurate
than
human
observation
unaided
but
while
in
science
observation
is
made
much
more
effective
by
the
use
of
mechanical
instruments
in
registering
facts
the
facts
with
which
art
deals
being
those
of
feeling
can
only
be
recorded
by
the
feeling
instrument
man
and
are
entirely
missed
by
any
mechanically
devised
substitutes
the
artistic
intelligence
is
not
interested
in
things
from
this
standpoint
of
mechanical
accuracy
but
in
the
effect
of
observation
on
the
living
consciousness
the
sentient
individual
in
each
of
us
the
same
fact
accurately
portrayed
by
a
number
of
artistic
intelligences
should
be
different
in
each
case
whereas
the
same
fact
accurately
expressed
by
a
number
of
scientific
intelligences
should
be
the
same
but
besides
the
feelings
connected
with
a
wide
range
of
experience
each
art
has
certain
emotions
belonging
to
the
particular
sense
perceptions
connected
with
it
that
is
to
say
there
are
some
that
only
music
can
convey
those
connected
with
sound
others
that
only
painting
sculpture
or
architecture
can
convey
those
connected
with
the
form
and
colour
that
they
severally
deal
with
in
abstract
form
and
colour
that
is
form
and
colour
unconnected
with
natural
appearances
there
is
an
emotional
power
such
as
there
is
in
music
the
sounds
of
which
have
no
direct
connection
with
anything
in
nature
but
only
with
that
mysterious
sense
we
have
the
sense
of
harmony
beauty
or
rhythm
all
three
but
different
aspects
of
the
same
thing
this
inner
sense
is
a
very
remarkable
fact
and
will
be
found
to
some
extent
in
all
certainly
all
civilised
races
and
when
the
art
of
a
remote
people
like
the
chinese
and
japanese
is
understood
our
senses
of
harmony
are
found
to
be
wonderfully
in
agreement
despite
the
fact
that
their
art
has
developed
on
lines
widely
different
from
our
own
none
the
less
when
the
surprise
at
its
newness
has
worn
off
and
we
begin
to
understand
it
we
find
it
conforms
to
very
much
the
same
sense
of
harmony
but
apart
from
the
feelings
connected
directly
with
the
means
of
expression
there
appears
to
be
much
in
common
between
all
the
arts
in
their
most
profound
expression
there
seems
to
be
a
common
centre
in
our
inner
life
that
they
all
appeal
to
possibly
at
this
centre
are
the
great
primitive
emotions
common
to
all
men
the
religious
group
the
deep
awe
and
reverence
men
feel
when
contemplating
the
great
mystery
of
the
universe
and
their
own
littleness
in
the
face
of
its
vastness
the
desire
to
correspond
and
develop
relationship
with
the
something
outside
themselves
that
is
felt
to
be
behind
and
through
all
things
then
there
are
those
connected
with
the
joy
of
life
the
throbbing
of
the
great
life
spirit
the
gladness
of
being
the
desire
of
the
sexes
and
also
those
connected
with
the
sadness
and
mystery
of
death
and
decay
the
technical
side
of
an
art
is
however
not
concerned
with
these
deeper
motives
but
with
the
things
of
sense
through
which
they
find
expression
in
the
case
of
painting
the
visible
universe
the
artist
is
capable
of
being
stimulated
to
artistic
expression
by
all
things
seen
no
matter
what
to
him
nothing
comes
amiss
great
pictures
have
been
made
of
beautiful
people
in
beautiful
clothes
and
of
squalid
people
in
ugly
clothes
of
beautiful
architectural
buildings
and
the
ugly
hovels
of
the
poor
and
the
same
painter
who
painted
the
alps
painted
the
great
western
railway
the
visible
world
is
to
the
artist
as
it
were
a
wonderful
garment
at
times
revealing
to
him
the
beyond
the
inner
truth
there
is
in
all
things
he
has
a
consciousness
of
some
correspondence
with
something
the
other
side
of
visible
things
and
dimly
felt
through
them
a
still
small
voice
which
he
is
impelled
to
interpret
to
man
it
is
the
expression
of
this
inner
significance
that
i
think
we
recognise
as
beauty
and
that
prompted
keats
to
say
beauty
is
truth
truth
beauty
and
hence
it
is
that
the
love
of
truth
and
the
love
of
beauty
can
exist
together
in
the
work
of
the
artist
the
search
for
this
inner
truth
is
the
search
for
beauty
people
whose
vision
does
not
penetrate
beyond
the
narrow
limits
of
the
commonplace
and
to
whom
a
cabbage
is
but
a
vulgar
vegetable
are
surprised
if
they
see
a
beautiful
picture
painted
of
one
and
say
that
the
artist
has
idealised
it
meaning
that
he
has
consciously
altered
its
appearance
on
some
idealistic
formula
whereas
he
has
probably
only
honestly
given
expression
to
a
truer
deeper
vision
than
they
had
been
aware
of
the
commonplace
is
not
the
true
but
only
the
shallow
view
of
things

art
is
the
expression
of
the
invisible
by
means
of
the
visible
expresses
the
same
idea
and
it
is
this
that
gives
to
art
its
high
place
among
the
works
of
man
beautiful
things
seem
to
put
us
in
correspondence
with
a
world
the
harmonies
of
which
are
more
perfect
and
bring
a
deeper
peace
than
this
imperfect
life
seems
capable
of
yielding
of
itself
our
moments
of
peace
are
i
think
always
associated
with
some
form
of
beauty
of
this
spark
of
harmony
within
corresponding
with
some
infinite
source
without
like
a
mariner
compass
we
are
restless
until
we
find
repose
in
this
one
direction
in
moments
of
beauty
for
beauty
is
strictly
speaking
a
state
of
mind
rather
than
an
attribute
of
certain
objects
although
certain
things
have
the
power
of
inducing
it
more
than
others
we
seem
to
get
a
glimpse
of
this
deeper
truth
behind
the
things
of
sense
and
who
can
say
but
that
this
sense
dull
enough
in
most
of
us
is
not
an
echo
of
a
greater
harmony
existing
somewhere
the
other
side
of
things
that
we
dimly
feel
through
them
evasive
though
it
is
but
we
must
tread
lightly
in
these
rarefied
regions
and
get
on
to
more
practical
concerns
by
finding
and
emphasising
in
his
work
those
elements
in
visual
appearances
that
express
these
profounder
things
the
painter
is
enabled
to
stimulate
the
perception
of
them
in
others
in
the
representation
of
a
fine
mountain
for
instance
there
are
besides
all
its
rhythmic
beauty
of
form
and
colour
associations
touching
deeper
chords
in
our
natures
associations
connected
with
its
size
age
and
permanence
at
any
rate
we
have
more
feelings
than
form
and
colour
of
themselves
are
capable
of
arousing
and
these
things
must
be
felt
by
the
painter
and
his
picture
painted
under
the
influence
of
these
feelings
if
he
is
instinctively
to
select
those
elements
of
form
and
colour
that
convey
them
such
deeper
feelings
are
far
too
intimately
associated
even
with
the
finer
beauties
of
mere
form
and
colour
for
the
painter
to
be
able
to
neglect
them
no
amount
of
technical
knowledge
will
take
the
place
of
feeling
or
direct
the
painter
so
surely
in
his
selection
of
what
is
fine
there
are
those
who
would
say
this
is
all
very
well
but
the
concern
is
with
form
and
colour
and
paint
and
nothing
else
if
he
paints
the
mountain
faithfully
from
that
point
of
view
it
will
suggest
all
these
other
associations
to
those
who
want
them
and
others
who
would
say
that
the
form
and
colour
of
appearances
are
only
to
be
used
as
a
language
to
give
expression
to
the
feelings
common
to
all
men
art
for
art
sake
and
art
for
subject
sake
there
are
these
two
extreme
positions
to
consider
and
it
will
depend
on
the
individual
on
which
side
his
work
lies
his
interest
will
be
more
on
the
aesthetic
side
in
the
feelings
directly
concerned
with
form
and
colour
or
on
the
side
of
the
mental
associations
connected
with
appearances
according
to
his
temperament
but
neither
position
can
neglect
the
other
without
fatal
loss
the
picture
of
form
and
colour
will
never
be
able
to
escape
the
associations
connected
with
visual
things
neither
will
the
picture
all
for
subject
be
able
to
get
away
from
its
form
and
colour
and
it
is
wrong
to
say
if
he
paints
the
mountain
faithfully
from
the
form
and
colour
point
of
view
it
will
suggest
all
those
other
associations
to
those
who
want
them
unless
as
is
possible
with
a
painter
he
be
unconsciously
moved
by
deeper
feelings
and
impelled
to
select
the
significant
things
while
only
conscious
of
his
paint
but
the
chances
are
that
his
picture
will
convey
the
things
he
was
thinking
about
and
in
consequence
instead
of
impressing
us
with
the
grandeur
of
the
mountain
will
say
something
very
like
see
what
a
clever
painter
i
am
unless
the
artist
has
painted
his
picture
under
the
influence
of
the
deeper
feelings
the
scene
was
capable
of
producing
it
is
not
likely
anybody
will
be
so
impressed
when
they
look
at
his
work
and
the
painter
deeply
moved
with
high
ideals
as
to
subject
matter
who
neglects
the
form
and
colour
through
which
he
is
expressing
them
will
find
that
his
work
has
failed
to
be
convincing
the
immaterial
can
only
be
expressed
through
the
material
in
art
and
the
painted
symbols
of
the
picture
must
be
very
perfect
if
subtle
and
elusive
meanings
are
to
be
conveyed
if
he
can
not
paint
the
commonplace
aspect
of
our
mountain
how
can
he
expect
to
paint
any
expression
of
the
deeper
things
in
it
the
fact
is
both
positions
are
incomplete
in
all
good
art
the
matter
expressed
and
the
manner
of
its
expression
are
so
intimate
as
to
have
become
one
the
deeper
associations
connected
with
the
mountain
are
only
matters
for
art
in
so
far
as
they
affect
its
appearance
and
take
shape
as
form
and
colour
in
the
mind
of
the
artist
informing
the
whole
process
of
the
painting
even
to
the
brush
strokes
as
in
a
good
poem
it
is
impossible
to
consider
the
poetic
idea
apart
from
the
words
that
express
it
they
are
fired
together
at
its
creation
now
an
expression
by
means
of
one
of
our
different
sense
perceptions
does
not
constitute
art
or
the
boy
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
giving
expression
to
his
delight
in
life
but
making
a
horrible
noise
would
be
an
artist
if
his
expression
is
to
be
adequate
to
convey
his
feeling
to
others
there
must
be
some
arrangement
the
expression
must
be
ordered
rhythmic
or
whatever
word
most
fitly
conveys
the
idea
of
those
powers
conscious
or
unconscious
that
select
and
arrange
the
sensuous
material
of
art
so
as
to
make
the
most
telling
impression
by
bringing
it
into
relation
with
our
innate
sense
of
harmony
if
we
can
find
a
rough
definition
that
will
include
all
the
arts
it
will
help
us
to
see
in
what
direction
lie
those
things
in
painting
that
make
it
an
art
the
not
uncommon
idea
that
painting
is
the
production
by
means
of
colours
of
more
or
less
perfect
representations
of
natural
objects
will
not
do
and
it
is
devoutly
to
be
hoped
that
science
will
perfect
a
method
of
colour
photography
finally
to
dispel
this
illusion
what
then
will
serve
as
a
working
definition
there
must
be
something
about
feeling
the
expression
of
that
individuality
the
secret
of
which
everyone
carries
in
himself
the
expression
of
that
ego
that
perceives
and
is
moved
by
the
phenomena
of
life
around
us
and
on
the
other
hand
something
about
the
ordering
of
its
expression
but
who
knows
of
words
that
can
convey
a
just
idea
of
such
subtle
matter
if
one
says
art
is
the
rhythmic
expression
of
life
or
emotional
consciousness
or
feeling
all
are
inadequate
perhaps
the
rhythmic
expression
of
life
would
be
the
more
perfect
definition
but
the
word
life
is
so
much
more
associated
with
eating
and
drinking
in
the
popular
mind
than
with
the
spirit
or
force
or
whatever
you
care
to
call
it
that
exists
behind
consciousness
and
is
the
animating
factor
of
our
whole
being
that
it
will
hardly
serve
a
useful
purpose
so
that
perhaps
for
a
rough
practical
definition
that
will
at
least
point
away
from
the
mechanical
performances
that
so
often
pass
for
art
the
rhythmic
expression
of
feeling
will
do
for
by
rhythm
is
meant
that
ordering
of
the
materials
of
art
form
and
colour
in
the
case
of
painting
so
as
to
bring
them
into
relationship
with
our
innate
sense
of
harmony
which
gives
them
their
expressive
power
without
this
relationship
we
have
no
direct
means
of
making
the
sensuous
material
of
art
awaken
an
answering
echo
in
others
the
boy
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
making
a
horrible
noise
was
not
an
artist
because
his
expression
was
inadequate
was
not
related
to
the
underlying
sense
of
harmony
that
would
have
given
it
expressive
power

feelings
that
are
stirring
in
him
if
he
merely
does
this
he
is
not
an
artist
although
the
recital
of
such
a
terrible
incident
may
be
moving
but
the
moment
he
arranges
his
words
so
as
to
convey
in
a
telling
manner
not

the
plain
facts
but
the
horrible
feelings
he
experienced

he

a

he

more
artistic

result
or
in

a

so
long
as
a
man
is
interested
solely
in
the
utilitarian
side
of
the
matter
as
are
so
many
builders
and
just
puts
up
walls
as
he
needs
protection
from
wild
beasts
and
a
roof
to
keep
out
the
rain
he
is
not
yet
an
artist
but
the
moment
he
begins
to
consider
his
work
with
some
feeling
and
arranges
the
relative
sizes
of
his
walls
and
roof
so
that
they
answer
to
some
sense
he
has
for
beautiful
proportion
he
has
become
an
artist
and
his
hut
has
some
architectural
pretensions
now
if
his
hut
is
of
wood
and
he
paints
it
to
protect
it
from
the
elements
nothing
necessarily
artistic
has
been
done
but
if
he
selects
colours
that
give
him
pleasure
in
their
arrangement
and
if
the
forms
his
colour
masses
assume
are
designed
with
some
personal
feeling
he
has
invented
a
primitive
form
of
decoration
and
likewise
the
savage
who
wishing
to
illustrate
his
description
of
a
strange
animal
he
has
seen
takes
a
piece
of
burnt
wood
and
draws
on
the
wall
his
idea
of
what
it
looked
like
a
sort
of
catalogue
of
its
appearance
in
its
details
he
is
not
necessarily
an
artist
it
is
only
when
he
draws
under
the
influence
of
some
feeling
of
some
pleasure
he
felt
in
the
appearance
of
the
animal
that
he
becomes
an
artist
of
course
in
each
case
it
is
assumed
that
the
men
have
the
power
to
be
moved
by
these
things
and
whether
they
are
good
or
poor
artists
will
depend
on
the
quality
of
their
feeling
and
the
fitness
of
its
expression
illustration

iv
study

for

of
boreas
the
purest
form
of
this
rhythmic
expression
of
feeling
is
music
and
as
walter
pater
shows
us
in
his
essay
on
the
school
of
giorgione
music
is
the
type
of
art
the
others
are
more
artistic
as
they
approach
its
conditions
poetry
the
most
musical
form
of
literature
is
its
most
artistic
form
and
in
the
greatest
pictures
form
colour
and
idea
are
united
to
thrill
us
with
harmonies
analogous
to
music
the
painter
expresses
his
feelings
through
the
representation
of
the
visible
world
of
nature
and
through
the
representation
of
those
combinations
of
form
and
colour
inspired
in
his
imagination
that
were
all
originally
derived
from
visible
nature
if
he
fails
from
lack
of
skill
to
make
his
representation
convincing
to
reasonable
people
no
matter
how
sublime
has
been
his
artistic
intention
he
will
probably
have
landed
in
the
ridiculous
and
yet
so
great
is
the
power
of
direction
exercised
by
the
emotions
on
the
artist
that
it
is
seldom
his
work
fails
to
convey
something
when
genuine
feeling
has
been
the
motive
on
the
other
hand
the
painter
with
no
artistic
impulse
who
makes
a
laboriously
commonplace
picture
of
some
ordinary
or
pretentious
subject
has
equally
failed
as
an
artist
however
much
the
skilfulness
of
his
representations
may
gain
him
reputation
with
the
unthinking
the
study
therefore
of
the
representation
of
visible
nature
and
of
the
powers
of
expression
possessed
by
form
and
colour
is
the
object
of
the
painter
training
and
a
command
over
this
power
of
representation
and
expression
is
absolutely
necessary
if
he
is
to
be
capable
of
doing
anything
worthy
of
his
art
this
is
all
in
art
that
one
can
attempt
to
teach
the
emotional
side
is
beyond
the
scope
of
teaching
you
can
not
teach
people
how
to
feel
all
you
can
do
is
to
surround
them
with
the
conditions
calculated
to
stimulate
any
natural
feeling
they
may
possess
and
this
is
done
by
familiarising
students
with
the
best
works
of
art
and
nature
it
is
surprising
how
few
art
students
have
any
idea
of
what
it
is
that
constitutes
art
they
are
impelled
it
is
to
be
assumed
by
a
natural
desire
to
express
themselves
by
painting
and
if
their
intuitive
ability
is
strong
enough
it
perhaps
matters
little
whether
they
know
or
not
but
to
the
larger
number
who
are
not
so
violently
impelled
it
is
highly
essential
that
they
have
some
better
idea
of
art
than
that
it
consists
in
setting
down
your
canvas
before
nature
and
copying
it
inadequate
as
this
imperfect
treatment
of
a
profoundly
interesting
subject
is
it
may
serve
to
give
some
idea
of
the
point
of
view
from
which
the
following
pages
are
written
and
if
it
also
serves
to
disturb
the
copying
theory
in
the
minds
of
any
students
and
encourages
them
to
make
further
inquiry
it
will
have
served
a
useful
purpose
ii
drawing
by
drawing
is
here
meant
the
expression
of
form
upon
a
plane
surface
art
probably
owes
more
to
form
for
its
range
of
expression
than
to
colour
many
of
the
noblest
things
it
is
capable
of
conveying
are
expressed
by
form
more
directly
than
by
anything
else
and
it
is
interesting
to
notice
how
some
of
the
world
greatest
artists
have
been
very
restricted
in
their
use
of
colour
preferring
to
depend
on
form
for
their
chief
appeal
it
is
reported
that
apelles
only
used
three
colours
black
red
and
yellow
and
rembrandt
used
little
else
drawing
although
the
first
is
also
the
last
thing
the
painter
usually
studies
there
is
more
in
it
that
can
be
taught
and
that
repays
constant
application
and
effort
colour
would
seem
to
depend
much
more
on
a
natural
sense
and
to
be
less
amenable
to
teaching
a
eye
for
the
appreciation
of
form
is
what
every
student
should
set
himself
to
acquire
with
all
the
might
of
which
he
is
capable
it
is
not
enough
in
artistic
drawing
to
portray
accurately
and
in
cold
blood
the
appearance
of
objects
to
express
form
one
must
first
be
moved
by
it
there
is
in
the
appearance
of
all
objects
animate
and
inanimate
what
has
been
called
an
emotional
significance
a
hidden
rhythm
that
is
not
caught
by
the
accurate
painstaking
but
cold
artist
the
form
significance
of
which
we
speak
is
never
found
in
a
mechanical
reproduction
like
a
photograph
you
are
never
moved
to
say
when
looking
at
one
what
fine
form
it
is
difficult
to
say
in
what
this
quality
consists
the
emphasis
and
selection
that
is
unconsciously
given
in
a
drawing
done
directly
under
the
guidance
of
strong
feeling
are
too
subtle
to
be
tabulated
they
escape
analysis
but
it
is
this
selection
of
the
significant
and
suppression
of
the
that
often
gives
to
a
few
lines
drawn
quickly
and
having
a
somewhat
remote
relation
to
the
complex
appearance
of
the
real
object
more
vitality
and
truth
than
are
to
be
found
in
a
and
painstaking
drawing
during
the
process
of
which
the
essential
and
vital
things
have
been
lost
sight
of
in
the
labour
of
the
work
and
the
which
is
usually
more
obvious
is
allowed
to
creep
in
and
obscure
the
original
impression
of
course
had
the
finished
drawing
been
done
with
the
mind
centred
upon
the
particular
form
significance
aimed
at
and
every
touch
and
detail
added
in
tune
to
this
idea
the
comparison
might
have
been
different
but
it
is
rarely
that
good
drawings
are
done
this
way
fine
things
seem
only
to
be
seen
in
flashes
and
the
nature
that
can
carry
over
the
impression
of
one
of
these
moments
during
the
labour
of
a
drawing
is
very
rare
and
belongs
to
the
few
great
ones
of
the
craft
alone
it
is
difficult
to
know
why
one
should
be
moved
by
the
expression
of
form
but
it
appears
to
have
some
physical
influence
over
us
in
looking
at
a
fine
drawing
say
of
a
strong
man
we
seem
to
identify
ourselves
with
it
and
feel
a
thrill
of
its
strength
in
our
own
bodies
prompting
us
to
set
our
teeth
stiffen
our
frame
and
exclaim
that
fine
or
when
looking
at
the
drawing
of
a
beautiful
woman
we
are
softened
by
its
charm
and
feel
in
ourselves
something
of
its
sweetness
as
we
exclaim
how
beautiful
the
measure
of
the
feeling
in
either
case
will
be
the
extent
to
which
the
artist
has
identified
himself
with
the
subject
when
making
the
drawing
and
has
been
impelled
to
select
the
expressive
elements
in
the
forms
art
thus
enables
us
to
experience
life
at
second
hand
the
small
man
may
enjoy
somewhat
of
the
wider
experience
of
the
bigger
man
and
be
educated
to
appreciate
in
time
a
wider
experience
for
himself
this
is
the
true
justification
for
public
picture
galleries
not
so
much
for
the
moral
influence
they
exert
of
which
we
have
heard
so
much
but
that
people
may
be
led
through
the
vision
of
the
artist
to
enlarge
their
experience
of
life
this
enlarging
of
the
experience
is
true
education
and
a
very
different
thing
from
the
memorising
of
facts
that
so
often
passes
as
such
in
a
way
this
may
be
said
to
be
a
moral
influence
as
a
larger
mind
is
less
likely
to
harbour
small
meannesses
but
this
is
not
the
kind
of
moral
influence
usually
looked
for
by
the
many
who
rather
demand
a
moral
story
told
by
the
picture
a
thing
not
always
suitable
to
artistic
expression
one
is
always
profoundly
impressed
by
the
expression
of
a
sense
of
bulk
vastness
or
mass
in
form
there
is
a
feeling
of
being
lifted
out
of
one
puny
self
to
something
bigger
and
more
stable
it
is
this
splendid
feeling
of
bigness
in
michael
angelo
figures
that
is
so
satisfying
one
can
not
come
away
from
the
contemplation
of
that
wonderful
ceiling
of
his
in
the
vatican
without
the
sense
of
having
experienced
something
of
a
larger
life
than
one
had
known
before
never
has
the
dignity
of
man
reached
so
high
an
expression
in
paint
a
height
that
has
been
the
despair
of
all
who
have
since
tried
to
follow
that
lonely
master
in
landscape
also
this
expression
of
largeness
is
fine
one
likes
to
feel
the
weight
and
mass
of
the
ground
the
vastness
of
the
sky
and
sea
the
bulk
of
a
mountain
on
the
other
hand
one
is
charmed
also
by
the
expression
of
lightness
this
may
be
noted
in
much
of
the
work
of
botticelli
and
the
italians
of
the
fifteenth
century
botticelli
figures
seldom
have
any
weight
they
drift
about
as
if
walking
on
air
giving
a
delightful
feeling
of
otherworldliness
the
hands
of
the
madonna
that
hold
the
child
might
be
holding
flowers
for
any
sense
of
support
they
express
it
is
i
think
on
this
sense
of
lightness
that
a
great
deal
of
the
exquisite
charm
of
botticelli
drawing
depends
the
feathery
lightness
of
clouds
and
of
draperies
blown
by
the
wind
is
always
pleasing
and
botticelli
nearly
always
has
a
light
wind
passing
through
his
draperies
to
give
them
this
sense
as
will
be
explained
later
in
connection
with
academic
drawing
it
is
eminently
necessary
for
the
student
to
train
his
eye
accurately
to
observe
the
forms
of
things
by
the
most
painstaking
of
drawings
in
these
school
studies
feeling
need
not
be
considered
but
only
a
cold
accuracy
in
the
same
way
a
singer
trains
himself
to
sing
scales
giving
every
note
exactly
the
same
weight
and
preserving
a
most
mechanical
time
throughout
so
that
every
note
of
his
voice
may
be
accurately
under
his
control
and
be
equal
to
the
subtlest
variations
he
may
afterwards
want
to
infuse
into
it
at
the
dictates
of
feeling
for
how
can
the
draughtsman
who
does
not
know
how
to
draw
accurately
the
cold
commonplace
view
of
an
object
hope
to
give
expression
to
the
subtle
differences
presented
by
the
same
thing
seen
under
the
excitement
of
strong
feeling
illustration
plate
from
a
study
by
botticelli
in
the
print
room
at
the
british
museum
these
academic
drawings
too
should
be
as
highly
finished
as
hard
application
can
make
them
so
that
the
habit
of
minute
visual
expression
may
be
acquired
it
will
be
needed
later
when
drawing
of
a
finer
kind
is
attempted
and
when
in
the
heat
of
an
emotional
stimulus
the
artist
has
no
time
to
consider
the
smaller
subtleties
of
drawing
which
by
then
should
have
become
almost
instinctive
with
him
leaving
his
mind
free
to
dwell
on
the
bigger
qualities
drawing
then
to
be
worthy
of
the
name
must
be
more
than
what
is
called
accurate
it
must
present
the
form
of
things
in
a
more
vivid
manner
than
we
ordinarily
see
them
in
nature
every
new
draughtsman
in
the
history
of
art
has
discovered
a
new
significance
in
the
form
of
common
things
and
given
the
world
a
new
experience
he
has
represented
these
qualities
under
the
stimulus
of
the
feeling
they
inspired
in
him
hot
and
underlined
as
it
were
adding
to
the
great
book
of
sight
the
world
possesses
in
its
art
a
book
by
no
means
completed
yet
so
that
to
say
of
a
drawing
as
is
so
often
said
that
it
is
not
true
because
it
does
not
present
the
commonplace
appearance
of
an
object
accurately
may
be
foolish
its
accuracy
depends
on
the
completeness
with
which
it
conveys
the
particular
emotional
significance
that
is
the
object
of
the
drawing
what
this
significance
is
will
vary
enormously
with
the
individual
artist
but
it
is
only
by
this
standard
that
the
accuracy
of
the
drawing
can
be
judged
it
is
this
difference
between
scientific
accuracy
and
artistic
accuracy
that
puzzles
so
many
people
science
demands
that
phenomena
be
observed
with
the
unemotional
accuracy
of
a
weighing
machine
while
artistic
accuracy
demands
that
things
be
observed
by
a
sentient
individual
recording
the
sensations
produced
in
him
by
the
phenomena
of
life
and
people
with
the
scientific
habit
that
is
now
so
common
among
us
seeing
a
picture
or
drawing
in
which
what
are
called
facts
have
been
expressed
emotionally
are
puzzled
if
they
are
modest
or
laugh
at
what
they
consider
a
glaring
mistake
in
drawing
if
they
are
not
when
all
the
time
it
may
be
their
mistaken
point
of
view
that
is
at
fault
but
while
there
is
no
absolute
artistic
standard
by
which
accuracy
of
drawing
can
be
judged
as
such
standard
must
necessarily
vary
with
the
artistic
intention
of
each
individual
artist
this
fact
must
not
be
taken
as
an
excuse
for
any
obviously
faulty
drawing
that
incompetence
may
produce
as
is
often
done
by
students
who
when
corrected
say
that
they
saw
it
so
for
there
undoubtedly
exists
a
rough
physical
standard
of
rightness
in
drawing
any
violent
deviations
from
which
even
at
the
dictates
of
emotional
expression
is
productive
of
the
grotesque
this
physical
standard
of
accuracy
in
his
work
it
is
the
business
of
the
student
to
acquire
in
his
academic
training
and
every
aid
that
science
can
give
by
such
studies
as
perspective
anatomy
and
in
the
case
of
landscape
even
geology
and
botany
should
be
used
to
increase
the
accuracy
of
his
representations
for
the
strength
of
appeal
in
artistic
work
will
depend
much
on
the
power
the
artist
possesses
of
expressing
himself
through
representations
that
arrest
everyone
by
their
truth
and
naturalness
and
although
when
truth
and
naturalness
exist
without
any
artistic
expression
the
result
is
of
little
account
as
art
on
the
other
hand
when
truly
artistic
expression
is
clothed
in
representations
that
offend
our
ideas
of
physical
truth
it
is
only
the
few
who
can
forgive
the
offence
for
the
sake
of
the
genuine
feeling
they
perceive
behind
it

the
necessities
of
expression
may
be
allowed
to
override
the
dictates
of
truth
to
physical
structure
in
the
appearance
of
objects
will
always
be
a
much
debated
point
in
the

departures
from
mechanical
accuracy
are
so
subtle
that
i
have
no
doubt
many
will
deny
the
existence
of
such
a
thing
altogether
good
artists
of
strong
natural
inspiration
and
simple
minds
are
often
quite
unconscious
of
doing
anything
when
painting

are
all
the

it

searching
accuracy
iii
vision
it
is
necessary
to
say
something
about
vision
in
the
first
place
if
we
are
to
have
any
grasp
of
the
idea
of
form
an
act
of
vision
is
not
so
simple
a
matter
as
the
student
who
asked
her
master
if
she
should
paint
nature
as
she
saw
nature
would
seem
to
have
thought
and
his
answer
yes
madam
provided
you
do
see
nature
as
you
paint
nature
expressed
the
first
difficulty
the
student
of
painting
has
to
face
the
difficulty
of
learning
to
see
let
us
roughly
examine
what
we
know
of
vision
science
tells
us
that
all
objects
are
made
visible
to
us
by
means
of
light
and
that
white
light
by
which
we
see
things
in
what
may
be
called
their
normal
aspect
is
composed
of
all
the
colours
of
the
solar
spectrum
as
may
be
seen
in
a
rainbow
a
phenomenon
caused
as
everybody
knows
by
the
sun
rays
being
split
up
into
their
component
parts
this
light
travels
in
straight
lines
and
striking
objects
before
us
is
reflected
in
all
directions
some
of
these
rays
passing
through
a
point
situated
behind
the
lenses
of
the
eye
strike
the
retina
the
multiplication
of
these
rays
on
the
retina
produces
a
picture
of
whatever
is
before
the
eye
such
as
can
be
seen
on
the
ground
glass
at
the
back
of
a
photographer
camera
or
on
the
table
of
a
camera
obscura
both
of
which
instruments
are
constructed
roughly
on
the
same
principle
as
the
human
eye
these
rays
of
light
when
reflected
from
an
object
and
again
when
passing
through
the
atmosphere
undergo
certain
modifications
should
the
object
be
a
red
one
the
yellow
green
and
blue
rays
all
in
fact
except
the
red
rays
are
absorbed
by
the
object
while
the
red
is
allowed
to
escape
these
red
rays
striking
the
retina
produce
certain
effects
which
convey
to
our
consciousness
the
sensation
of
red
and
we
say
that
is
a
red
object
but
there
may
be
particles
of
moisture
or
dust
in
the
air
that
will
modify
the
red
rays
so
that
by
the
time
they
reach
the
eye
they
may
be
somewhat
different
this
modification
is
naturally
most
effective
when
a
large
amount
of
atmosphere
has
to
be
passed
through
and
in
things
very
distant
the
colour
of
the
natural
object
is
often
entirely
lost
to
be
replaced
by
atmospheric
colours
as
we
see
in
distant
mountains
when
the
air
is
not
perfectly
clear
but
we
must
not
stray
into
the
fascinating
province
of
colour
what
chiefly
concerns
us
here
is
the
fact
that
the
pictures
on
our
retinas
are
flat
of
two
dimensions
the
same
as
the
canvas
on
which
we
paint
if
you
examine
these
visual
pictures
without
any
prejudice
as
one
may
with
a
camera
obscura
you
will
see
that
they
are
composed
of
masses
of
colour
in
infinite
variety
and
complexity
of
different
shapes
and
gradations
and
with
many
varieties
of
edges
giving
to
the
eye
the
illusion
of
nature
with
actual
depths
and
distances
although
one
knows
all
the
time
that
it
is
a
flat
table
on
which
one
is
looking
seeing
then
that
our
eyes
have
only
flat
pictures
containing
information
about
the
objective
world
from
whence
is
this
knowledge
of
distance
and
the
solidity
of
things
how
do
we
the
third
dimension
the
depth
and
thickness
by
means
of
flat
pictures
of
two
dimensions
the
power
to
judge
distance
is
due
principally
to
our
possessing
two
eyes
situated
in
slightly
different
positions
from
which
we
get
two
views
of
objects
and
also
to
the
power
possessed
by
the
eyes
of
focussing
at
different
distances
others
being
out
of
focus
for
the
time
being
in
a
picture
the
eyes
can
only
focus
at
one
distance
the
distance
the
eye
is
from
the
plane
of
the
picture
when
you
are
looking
at
it
and
this
is
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
the
perennial
difficulty
in
painting
backgrounds
in
nature
they
are
out
of
focus
when
one
is
looking
at
an
object
but
in
a
painting
the
background
is
necessarily
on
the
same
focal
plane
as
the
object
numerous
are
the
devices
resorted
to
by
painters
to
overcome
this
difficulty
but
they
do
not
concern
us
here
the
fact
that
we
have
two
flat
pictures
on
our
two
retinas
to
help
us
and
that
we
can
focus
at
different
planes
would
not
suffice
to
account
for
our
knowledge
of
the
solidity
and
shape
of
the
objective
world
were
these
senses
not
associated
with
another
sense
all
important
in
ideas
of
form
the
sense
of
touch
this
sense
is
very
highly
developed
in
us
and
the
earlier
period
of
our
existence
is
largely
given
over
to
feeling
for
the
objective
world
outside
ourselves
who
has
not
watched
the
little
baby
hands
feeling
for
everything
within
reach
and
without
its
reach
for
the
matter
of
that
for
the
infant
has
no
knowledge
yet
of
what
is
and
what
is
not
within
its
reach
who
has
not
offered
some
bright
object
to
a
young
child
and
watched
its
clumsy
attempts
to
feel
for
it
almost
as
clumsy
at
first
as
if
it
were
blind
as
it
has
not
yet
learned
to
focus
distances
and
when
he
has
at
last
got
hold
of
it
how
eagerly
he
feels
it
all
over
looking
intently
at
it
all
the
time
thus
learning
early
to
associate
the
feel
of
an
object
with
its
appearance
in
this
way
by
degrees
he
acquires
those
ideas
of
roughness
and
smoothness
hardness
and
softness
solidity
which
later
on
he
will
be
able
to
distinguish
by
vision
alone
and
without
touching
the
object
our
survival
depends
so
much
on
this
sense
of
touch
that
it
is
of
the
first
importance
to
us
we
must
know
whether
the
ground
is
hard
enough
for
us
to
walk
on
or
whether
there
is
a
hole
in
front
of
us
and
masses
of
colour
rays
striking
the
retina
which
is
what
vision
amounts
to
will
not
of
themselves
tell
us
but
associated
with
the
knowledge
accumulated
in
our
early
years
by
connecting
touch
with
sight
we
do
know
when
certain
combinations
of
colour
rays
strike
the
eye
that
there
is
a
road
for
us
to
walk
on
and
that
when
certain
other
combinations
occur
there
is
a
hole
in
front
of
us
or
the
edge
of
a
precipice
and
likewise
with
hardness
and
softness
the
child
who
strikes
his
head
against
the
is
forcibly
reminded
by
nature
that
such
things
are
to
be
avoided
and
feeling
that
it
is
hard
and
that
hardness
has
a
certain
look
it
avoids
that
kind
of
thing
in
the
future
and
when
it
strikes
its
head
against
the
pillow
it
learns
the
nature
of
softness
and
associating
this
sensation
with
the
appearance
of
the
pillow
knows
in
future
that
when
softness
is
observed
it
need
not
be
avoided
as
hardness
must
be
sight
is
therefore
not
a
matter
of
the
eye
alone
a
whole
train
of
associations
connected
with
the
objective
world
is
set
going
in
the
mind
when
rays
of
light
strike
the
retina
refracted
from
objects
and
these
associations
vary
enormously
in
quantity
and
value
with
different
individuals
but
the
one
we
are
here
chiefly
concerned
with
is
this
universal
one
of
touch
everybody
sees
the
shape
of
an
object
and
sees
whether
it
looks
hard
or
soft
sees
in
other
words
the
feel
of
it
if
you
are
asked
to
think
of
an
object
say
a
cone
it
will
not
i
think
be
the
visual
aspect
that
will
occur
to
most
people
they
will
think
of
a
circular
base
from
which
a
continuous
side
slopes
up
to
a
point
situated
above
its
centre
as
one
would
feel
it
the
fact
that
in
almost
every
visual
aspect
the
base
line
is
that
of
an
ellipse
not
a
circle
comes
as
a
surprise
to
people
unaccustomed
to
drawing
but
above
these
cruder
instances
what
a
wealth
of
associations
crowd
in
upon
the
mind
when
a
sight
that
moves
one
is
observed
put
two
men
before
a
scene
one
an
ordinary
person
and
the
other
a
great
poet
and
ask
them
to
describe
what
they
see
assuming
them
both
to
be
possessed
of
a
reasonable
power
honestly
to
express
themselves
what
a
difference
would
there
be
in
the
value
of
their
descriptions
or
take
two
painters
both
equally
gifted
in
the
power
of
expressing
their
visual
perceptions
and
put
them
before
the
scene
to
paint
it
and
assuming
one
to
be
a
commonplace
man
and
the
other
a
great
artist
what
a
difference
will
there
be
in
their
work
the
commonplace
painter
will
paint
a
commonplace
picture
while
the
form
and
colour
will
be
the
means
of
stirring
deep
associations
and
feelings
in
the
mind
of
the
other
and
will
move
him
to
paint
the
scene
so
that
the
same
splendour
of
associations
may
be
conveyed
to
the
beholder

for
what
it
is

has
been
neglected
neglected
to
such
an
extent
that
when
the

comes
to
attempt
drawing
sight
is
not
the
sense
he
consults
the
mental
idea
of
the
objective
world
that
has
grown
up
in
his
mind
is
now
associated
more
directly
with
touch
than
with
sight
with
the
felt
shape
rather
than
the
visual
appearance
so
that
if
he
is
asked
to
draw
a
head
he
thinks
of
it
first
as
an
object
having
a
continuous
boundary
in
space
this
his
mind
instinctively
conceives
as
a
line
then
hair
he
expresses
by
a
row
of
little
lines
coming
out
from
the
boundary
all
round
the
top
he
thinks
of
eyes
as
two
points
or
circles
or
as
points
in
circles
and
the
nose
either
as
a
triangle
or
an
line
if
you
feel
the
nose
you
will
see
the
reason
of
this
down
the
front
you
have
the

line

if
you
feel
round
it
you
will
find
the
two
sides
meeting
at
the
top
and
a
base
joining
them
suggesting
the
triangle
the
mouth
similarly
is
an
opening
with
a

of
teeth
which
are
generally
shown
although
so
seldom
seen
but
always
apparent
if
the
mouth
is
felt

a
this
is
i
think
a
fair
type
of
the
first
drawing
the
ordinary
child
makes
and
judging
by
some
ancient
scribbling
of
the
same
order
i
remember
noticing
scratched
on
a
wall
at
pompeii
and
by
savage
drawing
generally
it
appears
to
be
a
fairly
universal
type
it
is
a
very
remarkable
thing
which
as
far
as
i
know
has
not
yet
been
pointed
out
that
in
these
first
attempts
at
drawing
the
vision
should
not
be
consulted
a
blind
man
would
not
draw
differently
could
he
but
see
to
draw
were
vision
the
first
sense
consulted
and
were
the
simplest
visual
appearance
sought
after
one
might
expect
something
like

and

with
the
darker
mass
of
the

being
the
simplest
thing
the
visual
appearance
can
be
reduced
to
but
despite
this
being
quite
as
easy
to
do
it
does
not
appeal
to
the
ordinary
child
as
the
other
type
does
because
it
does
not
satisfy
the
sense
of
touch
that
forms
so
large
a
part
of
the
idea
of
an
object
in

all
architectural
elevations
and

projections
generally
appeal
to
this
mental
idea
of
form
they
consist
of
views
of
a
building

object
that
could
never
possibly
be

by
anybody

as
they
do
that
the
eye
of
the
spectator
is
exactly
in

of
every
part
of
the
building
at
the
same
time
a
physical
impossibility
and
yet
so
removed
from
the
actual
visual
appearance
is
our
mental
idea
of
objects
that
such
drawings
do
convey
a
very
accurate
idea
of
a
building
or
object
and
of
course
they
have
great
advantage
as
working
drawings
in
that

so
early

it
is
no
wonder
that
in
the
average
adult
it
is
in
such
a
shocking
state
of
neglect
i
feel
convinced
that
with
the
great
majority
of
people
vision
is
seldom
if
ever
consulted
for
itself
but
only
to
minister
to
some
other
sense
they
look

be
fine
at

to
see
if

from

surface

the
rich

calculate
how
deep
it
is

how
much
power
it
would
supply
to
work
a
mill
how
many
fish
it
contains
or
some
other
association
alien
to
its
visual
aspect
if
one
looks
up
at
a
fine
mass

to

is

wonder

colour
of
the

to
be
unobserved
clouds
mean
nothing
to
him
but
an
accumulation
of
water
dust
that
may
bring
rain
this
accounts
in
some
way
for
the
number
of
good
paintings
that
are
incomprehensible
to
the
majority
of
people
it
is
only
those
pictures
that
pursue
the
visual
aspect
of
objects
to
a
sufficient
completion
to
contain
the
suggestion
of
these
other
associations
that
they
understand
at
all
other
pictures
they
say
are
not
finished
enough
and
it
is
so
seldom
that
a
picture
can
have
this
petty
realisation
and
at
the
same
time
be
an
expression
of
those
larger
emotional
qualities
that
constitute
good
painting
the
early
paintings
of
the
brotherhood
appear
to
be
a
striking
exception
to
this
but
in
their
work
the
excessive
realisation
of
all
details
was
part
of
the
expression
and
gave
emphasis
to
the
poetic
idea
at
the
basis
of
their
pictures
and
was
therefore
part
of
the
artistic
intention
in
these
paintings
the
fiery
intensity
with
which
every
little
detail
was
painted
made
their
picture
a
ready
medium
for
the
expression
of
poetic
thought
a
sort
of
painted
poetry
every
detail
being
selected
on
account
of
some
symbolic
meaning
it
had
bearing
on
the
poetic
idea
that
was
the
object
of
the
picture
but
to
those
painters
who
do
not
attempt
painted
poetry
but
seek
in
painting
a
poetry
of
its
own
a
visual
poetry
this
excessive
finish
as
it
is
called
is
irksome
as
it
mars
the
expression
of
those
qualities
in
vision
they
wish
to
express
finish
in
art
has
no
connection
with
the
amount
of
detail
in
a
picture
but
has
reference
only
to
the
completeness
with
which
the
emotional
idea
the
painter
set
out
to
express
has
been
realised

the

of

nature
is

them

form
so
that
people
having
been
moved
by
it
in
his
work
may
be
encouraged
to
see
the
same
beauty
in
the
things
around
them
this
is
the
best
argument
in
favour
of
making
art
a
subject
of
general
education
that
it
should
teach
people
to
see
everybody
does
not
need
to
draw
and
paint
but
if
everybody
could
get
the
faculty
of
appreciating
the
form
and
colour
on
their
retinas
as
form
and
colour
what
a
wealth
would
always
be
at
their
disposal
for
enjoyment
the
japanese
habit
of
looking
at
a
landscape
upside
down
between
their
legs
is
a
way
of
seeing
without
the
deadening
influence
of
touch
associations
thus
looking
one
is
surprised
into
seeing
for
once
the
colour
and
form
of
things
with
the
association
of
touch
for
the
moment
forgotten
and
is
puzzled
at
the
beauty
the
odd
thing
is
that
although
thus
we
see
things
upside
down
the
pictures
on
our
retinas
are
for
once
the
right
way
up
for
ordinarily
the
visual
picture
is
inverted
on
the
retina
like
that
on
the
ground
glass
at
the
back
of
a
photographic
camera
to
sum
up
this
somewhat
rambling
chapter
i
have
endeavoured
to
show
that
there
are
two
aspects
from
which
the
objective
world
can
be
apprehended
there
is
the
purely
mental
perception
founded
chiefly
on
knowledge
derived
from
our
sense
of
touch
associated
with
vision
whose
primitive
instinct
is
to
put
an
outline
round
objects
as
representing
their
boundaries
in
space
and
secondly
there
is
the
visual
perception
which
is
concerned
with
the
visual
aspects
of
objects
as
they
appear
on
the
retina
an
arrangement
of
colour
shapes
a
sort
of
mosaic
of
colour
and
these
two
aspects
give
us
two
different
points
of
view
from
which
the
representation
of
visible
things
can
be
approached
when
the
representation
from
either
point
of
view
is
carried
far
enough
the
result
is
very
similar
work
built
up
on
outline
drawing
to
which
has
been
added
light
and
shade
colour
aerial
perspective
may
eventually
approximate
to
the
perfect
visual
appearance
and
inversely
representations
approached
from
the
point
of
view
of
pure
vision
the
mosaic
of
colour
on
the
retina
if
pushed
far
enough
may
satisfy
the
mental
perception
of
form
with
its
touch
associations
and
of
course
the
two
points
of
view
are
intimately
connected
you
can
not
put
an
accurate
outline
round
an
object
without
observing
the
shape
it
occupies
in
the
field
of
vision
and
it
is
difficult
to
consider
the
mosaic
of
colour
forms
without
being
very
conscious
of
the
objective
significance
of
the
colour
masses
portrayed
but
they
present
two
entirely
different
and
opposite
points
of
view
from
which
the
representation
of
objects
can
be
approached
in
considering
the
subject
of
drawing
i
think
it
necessary
to
make
this
division
of
the
subject
and
both
methods
of
form
expression
should
be
studied
by
the
student
let
us
call
the
first
method
line
drawing
and
the
second
mass
drawing
most
modern
drawing
is
a
mixture
of
both
these
points
of
view
but
they
should
be
studied
separately
if
confusion
is
to
be
avoided
if
the
student
neglects
line
drawing
his
work
will
lack
the
expressive
significance
of
form
that
only
a
feeling
for
lines
seems
to
have
the
secret
of
conveying
while
if
he
neglects
mass
drawing
he
will
be
poorly
equipped
when
he
comes
to
express
form
with
a
brush
full
of
paint
to
work
with
iv
line
drawing
most
of
the
earliest
forms
of
drawing
known
to
us
in
history
like
those
of
the
child
we
were
discussing
in
the
last
chapter
are
largely
in
the
nature
of
outline
drawings
this
is
a
remarkable
fact
considering
the
somewhat
remote
relation
lines
have
to
the
complete
phenomena
of
vision
outlines
can
only
be
said
to
exist
in
appearances
as
the
boundaries
of
masses
but
even
here
a
line
seems
a
poor
thing
from
the
visual
point
of
view
as
the
boundaries
are
not
always
clearly
defined
but
are
continually
merging
into
the
surrounding
mass
and
losing
themselves
to
be
caught
up
again
later
on
and
defined
once
more
its
relationship
with
visual
appearances
is
not
sufficient
to
justify
the
instinct
for
line
drawing
it
comes
i
think
as
has
already
been
said
from
the
sense
of
touch
when
an
object
is
felt
there
is
no
merging
in
the
surrounding
mass
but
a
firm
definition
of
its
boundary
which
the
mind
instinctively
conceives
as
a
line
there
is
a
more
direct
appeal
to
the
imagination
in
line
drawing
than
in
possibly
anything
else
in
pictorial
art
the
emotional
stimulus
given
by
fine
design
is
due
largely
to
line
work
the
power
a
line
possesses
of
instinctively
directing
the
eye
along
its
course
is
of
the
utmost
value
also
enabling
the
artist
to
concentrate
the
attention
of
the
beholder
where
he
wishes
then
there
is
a
harmonic
sense
in
lines
and
their
relationships
a
music
of
line
that
is
found
at
the
basis
of
all
good
art
but
this
subject
will
be
treated
later
on
when
talking
of
line
rhythm
most
artists
whose
work
makes
a
large
appeal
to
the
imagination
are
strong
on
the
value
of
line
blake
whose
visual
knowledge
was
such
a
negligible
quantity
but
whose
mental
perceptions
were
so
magnificent
was
always
insisting
on
its
value
and
his
designs
are
splendid
examples
of
its
powerful
appeal
to
the
imagination
on
this
basis
of
line
drawing
the
development
of
art
proceeded
the
early
egyptian
wall
paintings
were
outlines
tinted
and
the
earliest
wall
sculpture
was
an
incised
outline
after
these
incised
lines
some
man
of
genius
thought
of
cutting
away
the
surface
of
the
wall
between
the
outlines
and
modelling
it
in
low
relief
the
appearance
of
this
may
have
suggested
to
the
man
painting
his
outline
on
the
wall
the
idea
of
shading
between
his
outlines
at
any
rate
the
next
development
was
the
introduction
of
a
little
shading
to
relieve
the
flatness
of
the
and
suggest
modelling
and
this
was
as
far
as
things
had
gone
in
the
direction
of
the
representation
of
form
until
well
on
in
the
italian
renaissance
botticelli
used
nothing
else
than
an
outline
lightly
shaded
to
indicate
form
light
and
shade
were
not
seriously
perceived
until
leonardo
da
vinci
and
a
wonderful
discovery
it
was
thought
to
be
and
was
indeed
although
it
seems
difficult
to
understand
where
men
eyes
had
been
for
so
long
with
the
phenomena
of
light
and
shade
before
them
all
the
time
but
this
is
only
another
proof
of
what
can
not
be
too
often
insisted
on
namely
that
the
eye
only
sees
what
it
is
on
the
for
and
it
may
even
be
there
are
things
just
as
wonderful
yet
to
be
discovered
in
vision
but
it
was
still
the
touch
association
of
an
object
that
was
the
dominant
one
it
was
within
the
outline
demanded
by
this
sense
that
the
light
and
shade
were
to
be
introduced
as
something
as
it
were
put
on
the
object
it
was
the
solids
in
space
idea
that
art
was
still
appealing
to
the
first
object
of
a
painter
is
to
make
a
simple
flat
surface
appear
like
a
relievo
and
some
of
its
parts
detached
from
the
ground
he
who
excels
all
others
in
that
part
of
the
art
deserves
the
greatest
praise
wrote
leonardo
da
vinci
and
the
insistence
on
this
standing
out
quality
with
its
appeal
to
the
touch
sense
as
something
great
in
art
sounds
very
strange
in
these
days
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
means
of
creating
this
illusion
were
new
to
all
and
greatly
wondered
at
footnote
leonardo
da
vinci
on
paragraph
and
again
in
paragraph
of
his
treatise
leonardo
writes
the
knowledge
of
the
outline
is
of
most
consequence
and
yet
may
be
acquired
to
great
certainty
by
dint
of
study
as
the
outlines
of
the
human
figure
particularly
those
which
do
not
bend
are
invariably
the
same
but
the
knowledge
of
the
situation
quality
and
quantity
of
shadows
being
infinite
requires
the
most
extensive
study
the
outlines
of
the
human
figure
are
invariably
the
same
what
does
this
mean
from
the
visual
point
of
view
we
know
that
the
space
occupied
by
figures
in
the
field
of
our
vision
is
by
no
means
invariably
the
same
but
of
great
variety
so
it
can
not
be
the
visual
appearance
he
is
speaking
about
it
can
only
refer
to
the
mental
idea
of
the
shape
of
the
members
of
the
human
figure
the
remark
particularly
those
that
do
not
bend
shows
this
also
for
when
the
body
is
bent
up
even
the
mental
idea
of
its
form
must
be
altered
there
is
no
hint
yet
of
vision
being
exploited
for
itself
but
only
in
so
far
as
it
yielded
material
to
stimulate
this
mental
idea
of
the
exterior
world

original

it
was
called

and
the

all
faithful
to
it
as
the
means
of
holding
their
pictures
together
although
the
venetians
by
fusing
the
edges
of
their
outline
masses
got
very
near
the
visual
method
to
be
introduced
later
by
velazquez
in
this
way
little
by
little
starting
from
a
basis
of
simple
outline
forms
art
grew
up
each
new
detail
of
visual
appearance
discovered
adding
as
it
were
another
instrument
to
the
orchestra
at
the
disposal
of
the
artist
enabling
him
to
add
to
the
somewhat
crude
directness
and
simplicity
of
the
early
work
the
graces
and
refinements
of
the
more
complex
work
making
the
problem
of
composition
more
difficult
but
increasing
the
range
of
its
expression
but
these
additions
to
the
visual
formula
used
by
artists
was
not
all
gain
the
simplicity
of
the
means
at
the
disposal
of
a
botticelli
gives
an
innocence
and
imaginative
appeal
to
his
work
that
it
is
difficult
to
think
of
preserving
with
the
more
complete
visual
realisation
of
later
schools
when
the
realisation
of
actual
appearance
is
most
complete
the
mind
is
liable
to
be
led
away
by
side
issues
connected
with
the
things
represented
instead
of
seeing
the
emotional
intentions
of
the
artist
expressed
through
them
the
mind
is
apt
to
leave
the
picture
and
looking
as
it
were
not
at
it
but
through
it
to
pursue
a
train
of
thought
associated
with
the
objects
represented
as
real
objects
but
alien
to
the
artistic
intention
of
the
picture
there
is
nothing
in
these
early
formulae
to
disturb
the
contemplation
of
the
emotional
appeal
of
pure
form
and
colour
to
those
who
approach
a
picture
with
the
idea
that
the
representation
of
nature
the
making
it
look
like
the
real
thing
is
the
sole
object
of
painting
how
strange
must
be
the
appearance
of
such
pictures
as
botticelli
the
accumulation
of
the
details
of
visual
observation
in
art
is
liable
eventually
to
obscure
the
main
idea
and
disturb
the
large
sense
of
design
on
which
so
much
of
the
imaginative
appeal
of
a
work
of
art
depends
the
large
amount
of
new
visual
knowledge
that
the
naturalistic
movements
of
the
nineteenth
century
brought
to
light
is
particularly
liable
at
this
time
to
obscure
the
simpler
and
more
primitive
qualities
on
which
all
good
art
is
built
at
the
height
of
that
movement
line
drawing
went
out
of
fashion
and
charcoal
and
an
awful
thing
called
a
stump
took
the
place
of
the
point
in
the
schools
charcoal
is
a
beautiful
medium
in
a
dexterous
hand
but
is
more
adaptable
to
mass
than
to
line
drawing
the
less
said
about
the
stump
the
better
although
i
believe
it
still
lingers
on
in
some
schools
line
drawing
is
happily
reviving
and
nothing
is
so
calculated
to
put
new
life
and
strength
into
the
vagaries
of
naturalistic
painting
and
get
back
into
art
a
fine
sense
of
design
this
obscuring
of
the
direct
appeal
of
art
by
the
accumulation
of
too
much
naturalistic
detail
and
the
loss
of
power
it
entails
is
the
cause
of
artists
having
occasionally
gone
back
to
a
more
primitive
convention
there
was
the
archaistic
movement
in
greece
and
men
like
rossetti
and
found
a
better
means
of
expressing
the
things
that
moved
them
in
the
technique
of
the
fourteenth
century
and
it
was
no
doubt
a
feeling
of
the
weakening
influence
on
art
as
an
expressive
force
of
the
elaborate
realisations
of
the
modern
school
that
prompted
puvis
de
chavannes
to
invent
for
himself
his
large
primitive
manner
it
will
be
noticed
that
in
these
instances
it
is
chiefly
the
insistence
upon
outline
that
distinguishes
these
artists
from
their
contemporaries
art
like
life
is
apt
to
languish
if
it
gets
too
far
away
from
primitive
conditions
but
like
life
also
it
is
a
poor
thing
and
a
very
uncouth
affair
if
it
has
nothing
but
primitive
conditions
to
recommend
it
because
there
is
a
decadent
art
about
one
need
not
make
a
hero
of
the
pavement
artist
but
without
going
to
the
extreme
of
flouting
the
centuries
of
culture
that
art
inherits
as
it
is
now
fashionable
in
many
places
to
do
students
will
do
well
to
study
at
first
the
early
rather
than
the
late
work
of
the
different
schools
so
as
to
get
in
touch
with
the
simple
conditions
of
design
on
which
good
work
is
built
it
is
easier
to
study
these
essential
qualities
when
they
are
not
overlaid
by
so
much
knowledge
of
visual
realisation
the
skeleton
of
the
picture
is
more
apparent
in
the
earlier
than
the
later
work
of
any
school
the
finest
example
of
the
union
of
the
primitive
with
the
most
refined
and
cultured
art
the
world
has
ever
seen
is
probably
the
parthenon
at
athens
a
building
that
has
been
the
wonder
of
the
artistic
world
for
over
two
thousand
years
not
only
are
the
fragments
of
its
sculptures
in
the
british
museum
amazing
but
the
beauty
and
proportions
of
its
architecture
are
of
a
refinement
that
is
i
think
never
even
attempted
in
these
days
what
architect
now
thinks
of
correcting
the
poorness
of
hard
straight
lines
by
very
slightly
curving
them
or
of
slightly
sloping
inwards
the
columns
of
his
facade
to
add
to
the
strength
of
its
appearance
the
amount
of
these
variations
is
of
the
very
slightest
and
bears
witness
to
the
pitch
of
refinement
attempted
and
yet
with
it
all
how
simple
there
is
something
of
the
primitive
strength
of
stonehenge
in
that
solemn
row
of
columns
rising
firmly
from
the
steps
without
any
base
with
all
its
magnificence
it
still
retains
the
simplicity
of
the
hut
from
which
it
was
evolved
something
of
the
same
combination
of
primitive
grandeur
and
strength
with
exquisite
refinement
of
visualisation
is
seen
in
the
art
of
michael
angelo
his
followers
adopted
the
big
muscular
type
of
their
master
but
lost
the
primitive
strength
he
expressed
and
when
this
primitive
force
was
lost
sight
of
what
a
decadence
set
in
this
is
the
point
at
which
art
reaches
its
highest
mark
when
to
the
primitive
strength
and
simplicity
of
early
art
are
added
the
infinite
refinements
and
graces
of
culture
without
destroying
or
weakening
the
sublimity
of
the
expression
in
painting
the
refinement
and
graces
of
culture
take
the
form
of
an
increasing
truth
to
natural
appearances
added
bit
by
bit
to
the
primitive
baldness
of
early
work
until
the
point
is
reached
as
it
was
in
the
nineteenth
century
when
apparently
the
whole
facts
of
visual
nature
are
incorporated
from
this
wealth
of
visual
material
to
which
must
be
added
the
knowledge
we
now
have
of
the
arts
of
the
east
of
china
japan
and
india
the
modern
artist
has
to
select
those
things
that
appeal
to
him
has
to
select
those
elements
that
answer
to
his
inmost
need
of
expressing
himself
as
an
artist
no
wonder
a
period
of
artistic
dyspepsia
is
upon
us
no
wonder
our
exhibitions
particularly
those
on
the
continent
are
full
of
strange
weird
things
the
problem
before
the
artist
was
never
so
complex
but
also
never
so
interesting
new
forms
new
combinations
new
simplifications
are
to
be
found
but
the
steadying
influence
and
discipline
of
line
work
were
never
more
necessary
to
the
student
the
primitive
force
we
are
in
danger
of
losing
depends
much
on
line
and
no
work
that
aims
at
a
sublime
impression
can
dispense
with
the
basis
of
a
carefully
wrought
and
simple
line
scheme
the
study
therefore
of
pure
line
drawing
is
of
great
importance
to
the
painter
and
the
numerous
drawings
that
exist
by
the
great
masters
in
this
method
show
how
much
they
understood
its
value
and
the
revival
of
line
drawing
and
the
desire
there
is
to
find
a
simpler
convention
founded
on
this
basis
are
among
the
most
hopeful
signs
in
the
art
of
the
moment
v
mass
drawing
in
the
preceding
chapter
it
has
i
hope
been
shown
that
outline
drawing
is
an
instinct
with
western
artists
and
has
been
so
from
the
earliest
times
that
this
instinct
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
first
mental
idea
of
an
object
is
the
sense
of
its
form
as
a
felt
thing
not
a
thing
seen
and
that
an
outline
drawing
satisfies
and
appeals
directly
to
this
mental
idea
of
objects
but
there
is
another
basis
of
expression
directly
related
to
visual
appearances
that
in
the
fulness
of
time
was
evolved
and
has
had
a
very
great
influence
on
modern
art
this
form
of
drawing
is
based
on
the
consideration
of
the
flat
appearances
on
the
retina
with
the
knowledge
of
the
felt
shapes
of
objects
for
the
time
being
forgotten
in
opposition
to
line
drawing
we
may
call
this
mass
drawing
the
scientific
truth
of
this
point
of
view
is
obvious
if
only
the
accurate
copying
of
the
appearances
of
nature
were
the
sole
object
of
art
an
idea
to
be
met
with
among
students
the
problem
of
painting
would
be
simpler
than
it
is
and
would
be
likely
ere
long
to
be
solved
by
the
photographic
camera
this
form
of
drawing
is
the
natural
means
of
expression
when
a
brush
full
of
paint
is
in
your
hands
the
reducing
of
a
complicated
appearance
to
a
few
simple
masses
is
the
first
necessity
of
the
painter
but
this
will
be
fully
explained
in
a
later
chapter
treating
more
practically
of
the
practice
of
mass
drawing

how

chinese
masters
had
developed
the
point
of
view
the
art
of
china
and
japan
appears
to
have
been
more
influenced
by
this
view
of
natural
appearances
than
that
of
the
west
has
been
until
quite
lately
the
eastern
mind
does
not
seem
to
be
so
obsessed
by
the
objectivity
of
things
as
is
the
western
mind
with
us
the
practical
sense
of
touch
is
all
powerful
i
know
that
is
so
because
i
felt
it
with
my
hands
would
be
a
characteristic
expression
with
us
whereas
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
an
expression
the
eastern
mind
would
use
with
them
the
spiritual
essence
of
the
thing
seen
appears
to
be
the
more
real
judging
from
their
art
and
who
is
to
say
they
may
not
be
right
this
is
certainly
the
impression
one
gets
from
their
beautiful
painting
with
its
lightness
of
texture
and
avoidance
of
solidity
it
is
founded
on
nature
regarded
as
a
flat
vision
instead
of
a
collection
of
solids
in
space
their
use
of
line
is
also
much
more
restrained
than
with
us
and
it
is
seldom
used
to
accentuate
the
solidity
of
things
but
chiefly
to
support
the
boundaries
of
masses
and
suggest
detail
light
and
shade
which
suggest
solidity
are
never
used
a
wide
light
where
there
is
no
shadow
pervades
everything
their
drawing
being
done
with
the
brush
in
masses
when
as
in
the
time
of
titian
the
art
of
the
west
had
discovered
light
and
shade
linear
perspective
aerial
perspective
and
had
begun
by
fusing
the
edges
of
the
masses
to
suspect
the
necessity
of
painting
to
a
widely
diffused
focus
they
had
got
very
near
considering
appearances
as
a
visual
whole
but
it
was
not
until
velazquez
that
a
picture
was
painted
that
was
founded
entirely
on
visual
appearances
in
which
a
basis
of
objective
outlines
was
discarded
and
replaced
by
a
structure
of
tone
masses
when
he
took
his
own
painting
room
with
the
little
infanta
and
her
maids
as
a
subject
velazquez
seems
to
have
considered
it
entirely
as
one
flat
visual
impression
the
focal
attention
is
centred
on
the
infanta
with
the
figures
on
either
side
more
or
less
out
of
focus
those
on
the
extreme
right
being
quite
blurred
the
reproduction
here
given
unfortunately
does
not
show
these
subtleties
and
flattens
the
general
appearance
very
much
the
focus
is
nowhere
sharp
as
this
would
disturb
the
contemplation
of
the
large
visual
impression

the

of
the

and

is
no

between

it

within

the
slight

wonderful
as

is

the

is
a

and
makes
but
a
cold
impression
on
those
not
interested
in
the
technique
of
painting
with
the
cutting
away
of
the
primitive
support
of
fine
outline
design
and
the
absence
of
those
accents
conveying
a
fine
form

to
the
mind

lost
much
of
its
emotional
significance

first
picture
ever
painted
entirely
from
the
visual
or
impressionist
standpoint
sidenote
the
impressionist
point
of
view
but
art
has
gained
a
new
point
of
view
with
this
subjective
way
of
considering
appearances
this
impressionist
vision
as
it
has
been
called
many
things
that
were
too
ugly
either
from
shape
or
association
to
yield
material
for
the
painter
were
yet
found
when
viewed
as
part
of
a
scheme
of
colour
sensations
on
the
retina
which
the
artist
considers
emotionally
and
rhythmically
to
lend
themselves
to
new
and
beautiful
harmonies
and
ensembles
undreamt
of
by
the
earlier
formulae
and
further
many
effects
of
light
that
were
too
hopelessly
complicated
for
painting
considered
on
the
old
light
and
shade
principles
for
instance
sunlight
through
trees
in
a
wood
were
found
to
be
quite
paintable
considered
as
an
impression
of
various
colour
masses
the
early
formula
could
never
free
itself
from
the
object
as
a
solid
thing
and
had
consequently
to
confine
its
attention
to
beautiful
ones
but
from
the
new
point
of
view
form
consists
of
the
shape
and
qualities
of
masses
of
colour
on
the
retina
and
what
objects
happen
to
be
the
outside
cause
of
these
shapes
matters
little
to
the
impressionist
nothing
is
ugly
when
seen
in
a
beautiful
aspect
of
light
and
aspect
is
with
them
everything
this
consideration
of
the
visual
appearance
in
the
first
place
necessitated
an
increased
dependence
on
the
model
as
he
does
not
now
draw
from
his
mental
perceptions
the
artist
has
nothing
to
select
the
material
of
his
picture
from
until
it
has
existed
as
a
seen
thing
before
him
until
he
has
a
visual
impression
of
it
in
his
mind
with
the
older
point
of
view
the
representation
by
a
pictorial
description
as
it
were
based
on
the
mental
idea
of
an
object
the
model
was
not
so
necessary
in
the
case
of
the
impressionist
the
mental
perception
is
arrived
at
from
the
visual
impression
and
in
the
older
point
of
view
the
visual
impression
is
the
result
of
the
mental
perception
thus
it
happens
that
the
impressionist
movement
has
produced
chiefly
pictures
inspired
by
the
actual
world
of
visual
phenomena
around
us
the
older
point
of
view
producing
most
of
the
pictures
deriving
their
inspiration
from
the
glories
of
the
imagination
the
mental
world
in
the
mind
of
the
artist
and
although
interesting
attempts
are
being
made
to
produce
imaginative
works
founded
on
the
impressionist
point
of
view
of
light
and
air
the
loss
of
imaginative
appeal
consequent
upon
the
destruction
of
contours
by
scintillation
atmosphere
and
the
loss
of
line
rhythm
it
entails
have
so
far
prevented
the
production
of
any
very
satisfactory
results
but
undoubtedly
there
is
much
new
material
brought
to
light
by
this
movement
waiting
to
be
used
imaginatively
and
it
offers
a
new
field
for
the
selection
of
expressive
qualities
this
point
of
view
although
continuing
to
some
extent
in
the
spanish
school
did
not
come
into
general
recognition
until
the
last
century
in
france
the
most
extreme
exponents
of
it
are
the
body
of
artists
who
grouped
themselves
round
claude
monet
this
impressionist
movement
as
the
critics
have
labelled
it
was
the
result
of
a
fierce
determination
to
consider
nature
solely
from
the
visual
point
of
view
making
no
concessions
to
any
other
associations
connected
with
sight
the
result
was
an
entirely
new
vision
of
nature
startling
and
repulsive
to
eyes
unaccustomed
to
observation
from
a
purely
visual
point
of
view
and
used
only
to
seeing
the
feel
of
things
as
it
were
the
first
results
were
naturally
rather
crude
but
a
great
amount
of
new
visual
facts
were
brought
to
light
particularly
those
connected
with
the
painting
of
sunlight
and
half
light
effects
indeed
the
whole
painting
of
strong
light
has
been
permanently
affected
by
the
work
of
this
group
of
painters
emancipated
from
the
objective
world
they
no
longer
dissected
the
object
to
see
what
was
inside
it
but
studied
rather
the
anatomy
of
the
light
refracted
from
it
to
their
eyes
finding
this
to
be
composed
of
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
as
seen
in
the
solar
spectrum
and
that
all
the
effects
nature
produced
are
done
with
different
proportions
of
these
colours
they
took
them
or
the
nearest
pigments
they
could
get
to
them
for
their
palette
eliminating
the
earth
colours
and
black
and
further
finding
that
nature
colours
the
rays
of
coloured
light
when
mixed
produced
different
results
than
their
corresponding
pigments
mixed
together
they
determined
to
use
their
paints
as
pure
as
possible
placing
them
one
against
the
other
to
be
mixed
as
they
came
to
the
eye
the
mixture
being
one
of
pure
colour
rays
not
pigments
by
this
means
but
we
are
here
only
concerned
with
the
movement
as
it
affected
form
and
must
avoid
the
fascinating
province
of
colour
those
who
had
been
brought
up
in
the
old
school
of
outline
form
said
there
was
no
drawing
in
these
impressionist
pictures
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
mental
idea
of
form
discussed
in
the
last
chapter
there
was
indeed
little
although
had
the
impression
been
realised
to
a
sufficiently
definite
focus
the
sense
of
touch
and
solidity
would
probably
have
been
satisfied
but
the
particular
field
of
this
new
point
of
view
the
beauty
of
tone
and
colour
relations
considered
as
an
impression
apart
from
objectivity
did
not
tempt
them
to
carry
their
work
so
far
as
this
or
the
insistence
on
these
particular
qualities
would
have
been
lost
but
interesting
and
alluring
as
is
the
new
world
of
visual
music
opened
up
by
this
point
of
view
it
is
beginning
to
be
realised
that
it
has
failed
somehow
to
satisfy
in
the
first
place
the
implied
assumption
that
one
sees
with
the
eye
alone
is
wrong
in
every
object
there
is
inexhaustible
meaning
the
eye
sees
in
it
what
the
eye
brings
means
of
seeing
footnote
goethe
quoted
in
carlyle
chap
i
and
it
is
the
mind
behind
the
eye
that
supplies
this
means
of
perception
one
sees
with
the
mind
the
ultimate
effect
of
any
picture
be
it
impressionist
post
anti
or
otherwise
is
its
power
to
stimulate
these
mental
perceptions
within
the
mind
but
even
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
visual
perception
if
there
is
such
a
thing
that
modern
art
has
heard
so
much
talk
of
the
copying
of
the
retina
picture
is
not
so
great
a
success
the
impression
carried
away
from
a
scene
that
has
moved
us
is
not
its
complete
visual
aspect
only
those
things
that
are
significant
to
the
felt
impression
have
been
retained
by
the
mind
and
if
the
picture
is
to
be
a
true
representation
of
this
the
significant
facts
must
be
sorted
out
from
the
mass
of
irrelevant
matter
and
presented
in
a
lively
manner
the
impressionist
habit
of
painting
before
nature
entirely
is
not
calculated
to
do
this
going
time
after
time
to
the
same
place
even
if
similar
weather
conditions
are
waited
for
although
well
enough
for
studies
is
against
the
production
of
a
fine
picture
every
time
the
artist
goes
to
the
selected
spot
he
receives
a
different
impression
so
that
he
must
either
paint
all
over
his
picture
each
time
in
which
case
his
work
must
be
confined
to
a
small
scale
and
will
be
hurried
in
execution
or
he
must
paint
a
bit
of
today
impression
alongside
of
yesterday
in
which
case
his
work
will
be
dull
and
lacking
in
oneness
of
conception
and
further
in
decomposing
the
colour
rays
that
come
to
the
eye
and
painting
in
pure
colour
while
great
addition
was
made
to
the
power
of
expressing
light
yet
by
destroying
the
definitions
and
enveloping
everything
in
a
scintillating
atmosphere
the
power
to
design
in
a
large
manner
was
lost
with
the
wealth
of
significance
that
the
music
of
line
can
convey
but
impressionism
has
opened
up
a
view
from
which
much
interesting
matter
for
art
is
to
be
gleaned
and
everywhere
painters
are
selecting
from
this
and
grafting
it
on
to
some
of
the
more
traditional
schools
of
design
our
concern
here
is
with
the
influence
this
point
of
view
has
had
upon
draughtsmanship
the
influence
has
been
considerable
particularly
with
those
draughtsmen
whose
work
deals
with
the
rendering
of
modern
life
it
consists
in
drawing
from
the
observation
of
the
silhouette
occupied
by
objects
in
the
field
of
vision
observing
the
flat
appearance
of
things
as
they
are
on
the
retina
this
is
of
course
the
only
accurate
way
in
which
to
observe
visual
shapes
the
difference
between
this
and
the
older
point
of
view
is
its
insistence
on
the
observation
of
the
flat
visual
impression
to
the
exclusion
of
the
tactile
or
touch
sense
that
by
the
association
of
ideas
we
have
come
to
expect
in
things
seen
an
increased
truth
to
the
character
of
appearances
has
been
the
result
with
a
corresponding
loss
of
plastic
form
expression
on
pages
and
a
reproduction
of
a
drawing
in
the
british
museum
attributed
to
michael
angelo
is
contrasted
with

in
the
louvre
by
degas
the
one
is
drawn
from
the
line
point
of
view
and
the
other
from
the
mass
they
both
contain
lines
but
in
the
one
case
the
lines
are
the
contours
of
felt
forms
and
in
the
other
the
boundaries
of
visual
masses
in
the
michael
angelo
the
silhouette
is
only
the
result
of
the
overlapping
of
rich
forms
considered
in
the
round
every
muscle
and
bone
has
been
mentally
realised
as
a
concrete
thing
and
the
drawing
made
as
an
expression
of
this
idea
note
the
line
rhythm
also
the
sense
of
energy
and
movement
conveyed
by
the
swinging
curves
and
compare
with
what
is
said

transcribers
note

about
the
rhythmic
significance
of
swinging

then
compare
it
with
the
degas
and
observe
the
totally
different
attitude
of
mind
in
which
this
drawing
has
been
approached
instead
of
the
outlines
being
the
result
of
forms
felt
as
concrete
things
the
silhouette
is
everywhere
considered
first
the
plastic
sense
nowhere
so
great
as
in
the
other
being
arrived
at
from
the
accurate
consideration
of
the
mass
shapes
notice
also
the
increased
attention
to
individual
character

the
academic
and
conventional
the
terms
academic
and
conventional
are
much
used
in
criticism
and
greatly
feared
by
the
criticised
often
without
either
party
appearing
to
have
much
idea
of
what
is
meant
new
schools
of
painting
seem
to
arrive
annually
with
the
spring
fashions
and
sooner
or
later
the
one
of
last
year
gets
called
out
of
date
if
not
conventional
and
academic
and
as
students
for
fear
of
having
their
work
called
by
one
or
other
of
these
dread
terms
are
inclined
to
rush
into
any
new
extravagance
that
comes
along
some
inquiry
as
to
their
meaning
will
not
be
out
of
place
before
we
pass
into
the
chapters
dealing
with
academic
study
it
has
been
the
cry
for
some
time
that
schools
of
art
turned
out
only
academic
students
and
one
certainly
associates
a
dead
level
of
respectable
mediocrity
with
much
school
work
we
can
call
to
mind
a
lot
of
dull
lifeless
work
imperfectly
perfect
that
has
won
the
prize
in
many
a
school
competition
flaubert
says
a
form
deadens
and
it
does
seem
as
if
the
necessary
formality
of
a
school
course
had
some
deadening
influence
on
students
and
that
there
was
some
important
part
of
the
artist
development
which
it
has
failed
to
recognise
and
encourage
the
freer
system
of
the
french
schools
has
been
in
many
cases
more
successful
but
each
school
was
presided
over
by
an
artist
of
distinction
and
this
put
the
students
in
touch
with
real
work
and
thus
introduced
vitality
in
england
until
quite
lately
artists
were
seldom
employed
in
teaching
which
was
left
to
men
set
aside
for
the
purpose
without
any
time
to
carry
on
original
work
of
their
own
the
royal
academy
schools
are
an
exception
to
this
there
the
students
have
the
advantage
of
teaching
from
some
distinguished
member
or
associate
who
has
charge
of
the
upper
school
for
a
month
at
a
time
but
as
the
visitor
is
constantly
changed
the
less
experienced
students
are
puzzled
by
the
different
methods
advocated
and
flounder
hopelessly
for
want
of
a
definite
system
to
work
on
although
for
a
student
already
in
possession
of
a
good
grounding
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
the
system
as
contact
with
the
different
masters
widens
their
outlook
but
perhaps
the
chief
mistake
in
art
schools
has
been
that
they
have
too
largely
confined
themselves
to
training
students
mechanically
to
observe
and
portray
the
thing
set
before
them
to
copy
an
antique
figure
a
group
a
living
model
sitting
as
still
and
lifeless
as
he
can
now
this
is
all
very
well
as
far
as
it
goes
but
the
real
matter
of
art
is
not
necessarily
in
all
this
and
if
the
real
matter
of
art
is
neglected
too
long
the
student
may
find
it
difficult
to
get
in
touch
with
it
again
these
accurate
painstaking
school
studies
are
very
necessary
indeed
as
a
training
for
the
eye
in
observing
accurately
and
the
hand
in
reproducing
the
appearances
of
things
because
it
is
through
the
reproduction
of
natural
appearances
and
the
knowledge
of
form
and
colour
derived
from
such
study
that
the
student
will
afterwards
find
the
means
of
giving
expression
to
his
feelings
but
when
valuable
prizes
and
scholarships
are
given
for
them
and
for
really
artistic
work
they
do
tend
to
become
the
end
instead
of
the
means
it
is
of
course
improbable
that
even
school
studies
done
with
the
sole
idea
of
accuracy
by
a
young
artist
will
in
all
cases
be
devoid
of
artistic
feeling
it
will
creep
in
if
he
has
the
artistic
instinct
but
it
is
not
enough
encouraged
and
the
prize
is
generally
given
to
the
drawing
that
is
most
complete
and
like
the
model
in
a
commonplace
way
if
a
student
moved
by
a
strong
feeling
for
form
lets
himself
go
and
does
a
fine
thing
probably
only
remotely
like
the
model
to
the
average
eye
the
authorities
are
puzzled
and
do
usually
know
what
to
make
of
it
there
are
schools
where
the
most
artistic
qualities
are
encouraged
but
they
generally
neglect
the
academic
side
and
the
student
leaves
them
poorly
equipped
for
fine
work
surely
it
would
be
possible
to
make
a
distinction
giving
prizes
for
academic
drawings
which
should
be
as
thoroughly
accurate
in
a
mechanical
way
as
industry
and
application
can
make
them
and
also
for
artistic
drawings
in
which
the
student
should
be
encouraged
to
follow
his
bent
striving
for
the
expression
of
any
qualities
that
delight
him
and
troubling
less
about
mechanical
accuracy
the
use
of
drawing
as
an
expression
of
something
felt
is
so
often
left
until
after
the
school
training
is
done
that
many
students
fail
to
achieve
it
altogether
and
rows
of
lifeless
pictures
made
up
of
models
copied
in
different
attitudes
with
studio
properties
around
them
are
the
result
and
pass
for
art
in
many
quarters
such
pictures
often
display
considerable
ability
for
as
says
in
one
of
his
letters
it
is
very
difficult
to
paint
even
a
bad
picture
but
had
the
ability
been
differently
directed
the
pictures
might
have
been
good

what
is
the

but
perhaps
this
difference
can
be
brought
home
a
little
more
clearly
if
you
will
pardon
a
rather
fanciful
simile
i
am
told
that
if
you
construct
a
perfectly
fitted
engine
the
piston
fitting
the
cylinder
with
absolute
accuracy
and
the
axles
their
sockets
with
no
space
between
it
will
not
work
but
be
a
lifeless
mass
of
iron
there
must
be
enough
play
between
the
vital
parts
to
allow
of
some
movement
dither
is
i
believe
the
scotch
word
for
it
the
piston
must
be
allowed
some
play
in
the
opening
of
the
cylinder
through
which
it
passes
or
it
will
not
be
able
to
move
and
show
any
life
and
the
axles
of
the
wheels
in
their
sockets
and
in
fact
all
parts
of
the
machine
where
life
and
movement
are
to
occur
must
have
this
play
this
dither
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
the
accurately
fitting
engine
was
like
a
good
academic
drawing
in
a
way
a
perfect
piece
of
workmanship
but
lifeless
imperfectly
perfect
because
there
was
no
room
left
for
the
play
of
life
and
to
carry
the
simile
further
if
you
allow
too
great
a
play
between
the
parts
so
that
they
fit
one
over
the
other
too
loosely
the
engine
will
lose
power
and
become
a
poor
rickety
thing
there
must
be
the
smallest
amount
of
play
that
will
allow
of
its
working
and
the
more
perfectly
made
the
engine
the
less
will
the
amount
of
this
dither
be
the
word
dither
will
be
a
useful
name
to
give
that
elusive
quality
that
play
on
mechanical
accuracy
existing
in
all
vital
art
it
is
this
vital
quality
that
has
not
yet
received
much
attention
in
art
it
is
here
that
the
photograph
fails
it
can
only
at
best
give
mechanical
accuracy
whereas
art
gives
the
impression
of
a
live
individual
consciousness
where
the
recording
instrument
is
a
live
individual
there
is
no
mechanical
standard
of
accuracy
possible
as
every
recording
instrument
is
a
different
personality
and
it
is
the
subtle
differences
in
the
individual
renderings
of
nature
that
are
the
of
art
the
photograph
on
account
of
its
being
chained
to
mechanical
accuracy
has
none
of
this
play
of
life
to
give
it
charm
it
only
approaches
artistic
conditions
when
it
is
blurred
vague
and
indefinite
as
in
artistic
photography
for
then
only
can
some
amount
of
this
vitalising
play
this
dither
be
imagined
to
exist
it
is
this
perfect
accuracy
this
lack
of
play
of
variety
that
makes
the
article
so
lifeless
wherever
there
is
life
there
is
variety
and
the
substitution
of
the
for
the
article
has
impoverished
the
world
to
a
greater
extent
than
we
are
probably
yet
aware
of
whereas
formerly
before
the
advent
of
machinery
the
commonest
article
you
could
pick
up
had
a
life
and
warmth
which
gave
it
individual
interest
now
everything
is
turned
out
to
such
a
perfection
of
deadness
that
one
is
driven
to
pick
up
and
collect
in
sheer
desperation
the
commonest
rubbish
still
surviving
from
the
earlier
period
but
to
return
to
our
drawings
if
the
variations
from
strict
accuracy
made
under
the
influence
of
feeling
are
too
great
the
result
will
be
a
caricature
the
variations
in
a
beautiful
drawing
are
so
subtle
as
often
to
defy
detection
the
studies
of
ingres
are
an
instance
of
what
i
mean
how
true
and
instinct
with
life
are
his
lines
and
how
easily
one
might
assume
that
they
were
merely
accurate
but
no
merely
accurate
work
would
have
the
impelling
quality
these
drawings
possess
if
the
writer
may
venture
an
opinion
on
so
great
an
artist
the
subtle
difference
we
are
talking
about
was
sometimes
missed
by
even
ingres
himself
when
he
transferred
his
drawings
to
the
canvas
and
the
pictures
have
in
some
cases
become
academic
and
lifeless
without
the
stimulus
of
nature
before
him
it
was
difficult
to
preserve
the
dither
in
the
drawing
and
the
life
has
escaped
this
is
the
great
difficulty
of
working
from
studies
it
is
so
easy
to
lose
those
little
points
in
your
drawing
that
make
for
vitality
of
expression
in
the
process
of
copying
in
cold
blood

from
a
pencil
drawing
by
ingres
the
fact
is
it
is
only
the
academic
that
can
be
taught
and
it
is
no
small
thing
if
this
is
well
done
in
a
school
the
qualities
that
give
vitality
and
distinction
to
drawing
must
be
appreciated
by
the
student
himself
and
may
often
assert
themselves
in
his
drawing
without
his
being
aware
that
he
is
doing
aught
but
honestly
copying
and
if
he
has
trained
himself
thoroughly
he
will
not
find
much
difficulty
when
he
is
moved
to
vital
expression
all
the
master
can
do
is
to
stand
by
and
encourage
whenever
he
sees
evidence
of
the
real
thing
but
there
is
undoubtedly
this
danger
of
the
school
studies
becoming
the
end
instead
of
the
means
a
drawing
is
not
necessarily
academic
because
it
is
thorough
but
only
because
it
is
dead
neither
is
a
drawing
necessarily
academic
because
it
is
done
in
what
is
called
a
conventional
style
any
more
than
it
is
good
because
it
is
done
in
an
unconventional
style
the
test
is
whether
it
has
life
and
conveys
genuine
feeling
there
is
much
foolish
talk
about
conventional
art
as
if
art
could
ever
get
away
from
conventions
if
it
would
the
convention
will
be
more
natural
or
more
abstract
according
to
the
nature
of
the
thing
to
be
conveyed
and
the
medium
employed
to
express
it
but
naturalism
is
just
as
much
a
convention
as
any
of
the
other
isms
that
art
has
lately
been
so
assailed
with
for
a
really
unconventional
art
there
is
madame
tussaud
waxworks
there
even
the
convention
of
a
frame
and
flat
surface
are
done
away
with
besides
the
painted
symbols
to
represent
things
they
have
real
natural
chairs
tables
and
floors
real
clothes
and
even
real
hair
realism
everywhere
but
no
life
and
we
all
know
the
result
there
is
more
expression
of
life
in
a
few
lines
scribbled
on
paper
by
a
good
artist
than
in
all
the
reality
of
the
popular
show
it
would
seem
that
after
a
certain
point
the
nearer
your
picture
approaches
the
actual
illusion
of
natural
appearance
the
further
you
are
from
the
expression
of
life
one
can
never
hope
to
surpass
the
illusionary
appearance
of
a
tableau
vivant
there
you
have
real
living
people
but
what
an
awful
deathlike
stillness
is
felt
when
the
curtain
is
drawn
aside
the
nearer
you
approach
the
actual
in
all
its
completeness
the
more
evident
is
the
lack
of
that
movement
which
always
accompanies
life
you
can
not
express
life
by
copying
laboriously
natural
appearances
those
things
in
the
appearance
that
convey
vital
expression
and
are
capable
of
being
translated
into
the
medium
he
is
working
with
have
to
be
sought
by
the
artist
and
the
painted
symbols
of
his
picture
made
accordingly
this
lack
of
the
movement
of
life
is
never
noticed
in
a
good
picture
on
the
other
hand
the
figures
are
often
felt
to
move
pictures
are
blamed
for
being
conventional
when
it
is
lack
of
vitality
that
is
the
trouble
if
the
convention
adopted
has
not
been
vitalised
by
the
emotion
that
is
the
reason
of
the
painting
it
will
of
course
be
a
lifeless
affair
but
however
abstract
and
unnaturalistic
the
manner
adopted
if
it
has
been
truly
felt
by
the
artist
as
the
right
means
of
expressing
his
emotional
idea
it
will
have
life
and
should
not
be
called
conventional
in
the
commonly
accepted
offensive
use
of
the
term
it
is
only
when
a
painter
consciously
chooses
a
manner
not
his
own
which
he
does
not
comprehend
and
is
incapable
of
firing
with
his
own
personality
that
his
picture
is
ridiculous
and
conventional
in
the
dead
sense
but
every
age
differs
in
its
temperament
and
the
artistic
conventions
of
one
age
seldom
fit
another
the
artist
has
to
discover
a
convention
for
himself
one
that
fits
his
particular
individuality
but
this
is
done
simply
and
naturally
not
by
starting
out
with
the
intention
of
flouting
all
traditional
conventions
on
principle
nor
on
the
other
hand
by
accepting
them
all
on
principle
but
by
simply
following
his
own
bent
and
selecting
what
appeals
to
him
in
anything
and
everything
that
comes
within
the
range
of
his
vision
the
result
is
likely
to
be
something
very
different
from
the
violent
exploits
in
peculiarity
that
have
been
masquerading
as
originality
lately
originality
is
more
concerned
with
sincerity
than
with
the
struggling
and
fretting
after
originality
that
one
sees
in
modern
art
is
certainly
an
evidence
of
vitality
but
one
is
inclined
to
doubt
whether
anything
really
original
was
ever
done
in
so
forced
a
way
the
older
masters
it
seems
were
content
sincerely
to
try
and
do
the
best
they
were
capable
of
doing
and
this
continual
striving
to
do
better
led
them
almost
unconsciously
to
new
and
original
results
originality
is
a
quality
over
which
an
artist
has
as
little
influence
as
over
the
shape
and
distinction
of
his
features
all
he
can
do
is
to
be
sincere
and
try
and
find
out
the
things
that
really
move
him
and
that
he
really
likes
if
he
has
a
strong
and
original
character
he
will
have
no
difficulty
in
this
and
his
work
will
be
original
in
the
true
sense
and
if
he
has
not
it
is
a
matter
of
opinion
whether
he
is
not
better
employed
in
working
along
the
lines
of
some
manner
that
will
at
any
rate
keep
him
from
doing
anything
really
bad
than
in
struggling
to
cloak
his
own
commonplaceness
under
violent
essays
in
peculiarity
and
the
avoidance
of
the
obvious
at
all
costs
but
while
speaking
against
fretting
after
eccentricity
do
let
it
be
assumed
that
any
discouragement
is
being
given
to
genuine
new
points
of
view
in
art
when
a
thing
has
once
been
well
done
and
has
found
embodiment
in
some
complete
work
of
art
it
has
been
done
once
for
all
the
circumstances
that
produced
it
are
never
likely
to
occur
again
that
is
why
those
painters
who
continue
to
reproduce
a
picture
of
theirs
we
do
not
mean
literally
that
had
been
a
success
in
the
first
instance
never
afterwards
obtain
the
success
of
the
original
performance
every
beautiful
work
of
art
is
a
new
creation
the
result
of
particular
circumstances
in
the
life
of
the
artist
and
the
time
of
its
production
that
have
never
existed
before
and
will
never
recur
again
were
any
of
the
great
masters
of
the
past
alive
now
they
would
do
very
different
work
from
what
they
did
then
the
circumstances
being
so
entirely
different
so
that
should
anybody
seek
to
paint
like
titian
now
by
trying
to
paint
like
titian
did
in
his
time
he
could
not
attempt
anything
more
unlike
the
spirit
of
that
master
which
in
its
day
like
the
spirit
of
all
masters
was
most
advanced
but
it
is
only
by
a
scrupulously
sincere
and
truthful
attitude
of
mind
that
the
new
and
original
circumstances
in
which
we
find
ourselves
can
be
taken
advantage
of
for
the
production
of
original
work
and
seeking
after
peculiarity
only
stops
the
natural
evolution
and
produces
abortions
but
do
not
be
frightened
by
conventions
the
different
materials
in
which
the
artist
works
impose
their
conventions
and
as
it
is
through
these
materials
that
he
has
to
find
expression
what
expressive
qualities
they
possess
must
be
studied
and
those
facts
in
nature
selected
that
are
in
harmony
with
them
the
treatment
of
hair
by
sculptors
is
an
extreme
instance
of
this
what
are
those
qualities
of
hair
that
are
amenable
to
expression
in
stone
obviously
they
are
few
and
confined
chiefly
to
the
mass
forms
in
which
the
hair
arranges
itself
the
finest
sculptors
have
never
attempted
more
than
this
have
never
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
it
was
stone
they
were
working
with
and
never
made
any
attempt
to
create
an
illusion
of
real
hair
and
in
the
same
way
when
working
in
bronze
the
fine
artist
never
loses
sight
of
the
fact
that
it
is
bronze
with
which
he
is
working
how
sadly
the
distinguished
painter
to
whom
a
misguided
administration
entrusted
the
work
of
modelling
the
british
emblem
overlooked
this
may
be
seen
any
day
in
trafalgar
square
the
lions
there
possessing
none
of
the
splendour
of
bronze
but
looking
as
if
they
were
modelled
in
dough
and
possessing
in
consequence
none
of
the
vital
qualities
of
the
lion
it
is
interesting
to
compare
them
with
the
little
lion
alfred
stevens
modelled
for
the
railing
of
the
british
museum
and
to
speculate
on
what
a
thrill
we
might
have
received
every
time
we
passed
trafalgar
square
had
he
been
entrusted
with
the
work
as
he
might
have
been
and
in
painting
the
great
painters
never
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
it
is
paint
with
which
they
are
expressing
themselves
and
although
paint
is
capable
of
approaching
much
nearer
an
actual
illusory
appearance
of
nature
than
stone
or
bronze
they
never
push
this
to
the
point
where
you
forget
that
it
is
paint
this
has
been
left
for
some
of
the
smaller
men
and
when
it
comes
to
drawing
the
great
artists
have
always
confined
themselves
to
the
qualities
in
nature
that
the
tool
they
were
drawing
with
was
capable
of
expressing
and
no
others
whether
working
with
pen
pencil
chalk
or
charcoal
they
always
created
a
convention
within
which
unlimited
expression
has
been
possible
to
sum
up
academic
drawing
is
all
that
can
be
really
taught
and
is
as
necessary
to
the
painter
as
the
practising
of
exercises
is
to
the
musician
that
his
powers
of
observation
and
execution
may
be
trained
but
the
vital
matter
of
art
is
not
in
all
this
necessary
training
and
this
fact
the
student
should
always
keep
in
mind
and
be
ever
ready
to
give
rein
to
those
natural
enthusiasms
which
if
he
is
an
artist
he
will
find
welling
up
within
him
the
danger
is
that
the
absorbing
interest
in
his
academic
studies
may
take
up
his
whole
attention
to
the
neglect
of
the
instinctive
qualities
that
he
should
possess
the
possession
of
which
alone
will
entitle
him
to
be
an
artist
vii
the
study
of
drawing
we
have
seen
that
there
are
two
extreme
points
of
view
from
which
the
representation
of
form
can
be
approached
that
of
outline
directly
related
to
the
mental
idea
of
form
with
its
touch
association
on
the
one
hand
and
that
of
mass
connected
directly
with
the
visual
picture
on
the
retina
on
the
other
now
between
these
two
extreme
points
of
view
there
are
an
infinite
variety
of
styles
combining
them
both
and
leaning
more
to
the
one
side
or
the
other
as
the
case
may
be
but
it
is
advisable
for
the
student
to
study
both
separately
for
there
are
different
things
to
be
learnt
and
different
expressive
qualities
in
nature
to
be
studied
in
both
from
the
study
of
outline
drawing
the
eye
is
trained
to
accurate
observation
and
learns
the
expressive
value
of
a
line
and
the
hand
is
also
trained
to
definite
statement
the
student
being
led
on
by
degrees
from
simple
outlines
to
approach
the
full
realisation
of
form
in
all
the
complexity
of
light
and
shade
but
at
the
same
time
he
should
study
mass
drawing
with
paint
from
the
purely
visual
point
of
view
in
order
to
be
introduced
to
the
important
study
of
tone
values
and
the
expression
of
form
by
means
of
planes
and
so
by
degrees
he
will
learn
accurately
to
observe
and
portray
the
tone
masses
their
shapes
and
values
to
which
all
visual
appearances
can
be
reduced
and
he
will
gradually
arrive
at
the
full
realisation
of
form
a
realisation
that
will
bring
him
to
a
point
somewhat
similar
to
that
arrived
at
from
the
opposite
point
of
view
of
an
outline
to
which
has
been
added
light
and
shade
but
unless
both
points
of
view
are
studied
the
student
work
will
be
incomplete
if
form
be
studied
only
from
the
outline
point
of
view
and
what
have
been
called
sculptor
drawings
alone
attempted
the
student
will
lack
knowledge
of
the
tone
and
atmosphere
that
always
envelop
form
in
nature
and
also
he
will
be
poorly
equipped
when
he
comes
to
exchange
the
pencil
for
a
brush
and
endeavours
to
express
himself
in
paint
and
if
his
studies
be
only
from
the
mass
point
of
view
the
training
of
his
eye
to
the
accurate
observation
of
all
the
subtleties
of
contours
and
the
construction
of
form
will
be
neglected
and
he
will
not
understand
the
mental
form
stimulus
that
the
direction
and
swing
of
a
brush
stroke
can
give
these
and
many
things
connected
with
expression
can
best
be
studied
in
line
work
let
the
student
therefore
begin
on
the
principles
adopted
in
most
schools
with
outline
studies
of
simple
casts
or
models
and
gradually
add
light
and
shade
when
he
has
acquired
more
proficiency
he
may
approach
drawing
from
the
life
this
is
sufficiently
well
done
in
the
numerous
schools
of
art
that
now
exist
all
over
the
country
but
at
the
same
time
and
this
as
far
as
i
know
is
not
done
anywhere
the
student
should
begin
some
simple
form
of
mass
drawing
in
paint
simple
exercises
as
is
explained
later
in
the
chapter
on
mass

and

the
point
of

of

a

of
rubens
love
of

forms
compare
with
the
diagram
opposite
and
note
the
flatnesses
that
give
strength
to
the
forms
from
lack
of
this
elementary
tone
study
the
student
when
he
approaches
painting
for
the
first
time
with
only
his
outline
and
light
and
shade
knowledge
is
entirely
at
sea
with
brushes
and
paint
he
is
presented
with
a
problem
of
form
expressions
entirely
new
and
he
usually
begins
to
flounder
about
using
his
paint
as
much
like
chalk
on
paper
as
possible
and
timid
of
losing
his
outlines
he
fears
to
put
down
a
mass
as
he
has
no
knowledge
of
reducing
appearances
to
a
structure
of
tone
masses
or
planes
i
would
suggest
therefore
that
the
student
should
study
simultaneously
from
these
two
points
of
view
beginning
with
their
most
extreme
positions
that
is
bare
outline
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
side
tone
masses
criticised
for
their
accuracy
of
values
only
in
the
first
instance
as
he
advances
the
one
study
will
help
the
other
the
line
work
will
help
the
accuracy
with
which
he
observes
the
shapes
of
masses
and
when
he
comes
to
light
and
shade
his
knowledge
of
tone
values
will
help
him
here
united
at
last
when
complete
light
and
shade
has
been
added
to
his
outline
drawings
and
to
his
mass
drawing
an
intimate
knowledge
of
form
the
results
will
approximate
and
the
two
paths
will
meet
but
if
the
qualities
appertaining
to
either
point
of
view
are
not
studied
separately
the
result
is
confusion
and
the
muddling
through
method
so
common
in
our
schools
of
art
viii
line
drawing
practical
seeing
that
the
first
condition
of
your
drawing
is
that
it
has
to
be
made
on
a
flat
surface
no
matter
whether
it
is
to
be
in
line
or
mass
you
intend
to
draw
it
is
obvious
that
appearances
must
be
reduced
to
terms
of
a
flat
surface
before
they
can
be
expressed
on
paper
and
this
is
the
first
difficulty
that
confronts
the
student
in
attempting
to
draw
a
solid
object
he
has
so
acquired
the
habit
of
perceiving
the
solidity
of
things
as
was
explained
in
an
earlier
chapter
that
no
little
difficulty
will
be
experienced
in
accurately
seeing
them
as
a
flat
picture
sidenote
observing
solids
as
a
flat
copy
as
it
is
only
from
one
point
of
view
that
things
can
be
drawn
and
as
we
have
two
eyes
therefore
two
points
of
view
the
closing
of
one
eye
will
be
helpful
at
first
the
simplest
and
most
mechanical
way
of
observing
things
as
a
flat
subject
is
to
have
a
piece
of
cardboard
with
a
rectangular
hole
cut
out
of
the
middle
and
also
pieces
of
cotton
threaded
through
it
in
such
a
manner
that
they
make
a
pattern
of
squares
across
the
opening
as
in
the
accompanying
sketch
to
make
such
a
frame
get
a
piece
of
stiff
cardboard
about
inches
by
inches
and
cut
a
rectangular
hole
in
the
centre
inches
by
inches
as
in
diagram
iii
now
mark
off
the
inches
on
all
sides
of
the
opening
and
taking
some
black
thread
pass
it
through
the
point
a
with
a
needle
fixing
the
end
at
this
point
with
and
across
the
opening
to
the
corresponding
point
on
the
opposite
side
take
it
along
to
the
next
point
as
shown
by
the
dotted
line
and
pass
it
through
and
across
the
opening
again
and
so
on
until
b
is
reached
when
the
thread
should
be
held
by
some
quite
taut
everywhere
do
the
same
for
the
other
side
this
frame
should
be
held
between
the
eye
and
the
object
to
be
drawn
one
eye
being
closed
in
a
perfectly
vertical
position
and
with
the
rectangular
sides
of
the
opening
vertical
and
horizontal
the
object
can
then
be
observed
as
a
flat
copy
the
trellis
of
cotton
will
greatly
help
the
student
in
seeing
the
subject
to
be
drawn
in
two
dimensions
and
this
is
the
first
technical
difficulty
the
young
draughtsman
has
to
overcome
it
is
useful
also
in
training
the
eye
to
see
the
proportions
of
different
parts
one
to
another

squares
of
equal
size

one
a

which
all

can

you
can
move

how
much

been
made
to
illustrate
the
method
of
procedure
it
is
advisable
to
adopt
in
training
the
eye
to
accurate
observation
it
was
felt
that
a
vertical
line
drawn
through
the
pit
of
the
arm
would
be
the
most
useful
for
taking
measurements
on
and
this
was
first
drawn
and
its
length
decided
upon
train
yourself
to
draw
between
limits
decided
upon
at
the
start
this
power
will
be
of
great
use
to
you
when
you
wish
to
place
a
figure
in
an
exact
position
in
a
picture
the
next
thing
to
do
is
to
get
the
relative
heights
of
different
points
marked
upon
this
line
the
fold
at
the
pit
of
the
stomach
was
found
to
be
exactly
in
the

this
was
a
useful
start
and
it
is
generally
advisable
to
note
where
the
half
comes
first
and
very
useful
if
it
comes
in
some
obvious
place
other

were
taken

also

as
to

the

of
the
work
these

are
done
mentally
later
on
when
the

is
more
advanced
and
with
more
accuracy
than
the
clumsy
but
before
the
habit
of
having
constantly
in
mind
a
vertical
and
horizontal
line
with
which
to
compare
positions
is
acquired
they
should
be
put
in
with
as
much
accuracy
as
measuring
can
give
sidenote
blocking
in
your
drawing
the
next
thing
to
do
is
to
block
out
the
spaces
corresponding
to
those
occupied
by
the
model
in
the
field
of
your
vision
the
method
employed
to
do
this
is
somewhat
similar
to
that
adopted
by
a
surveyor
in
drawing
the
plan
of
a
field
assuming
he
had
an
irregular
shaped
one
such
as
is
drawn
in
fig

note

he
would
proceed
to
invest
it
with
straight
lines
taking
advantage
of
any
straightness
in
the
boundary
noting
the
length
and
the
angles
at
which
these
straight
lines
cut
each
other
and
then
reproducing
them
to
scale
on
his
plan
once
having
got
this
scaffolding
accurately
placed
he
can
draw
the
irregularities
of
the
shape
in
relation
to
these
lines
with
some
certainty
of
getting
them
right
you
should
proceed
in
very
much
the
same
way
to
block
out
the
spaces
that
the
forms
of
your

it

to

proper
so
far
you
have
only
been
pegging
out
the

it
is
going
to
occupy
this
initial
scaffolding
so
necessary
to
train

should
be
done
as
accurately
as
possible
but
do
let
it
interfere
with
your
freedom
in
expressing
the
forms
afterwards
the
work
up
to
this
point
has
been
mechanical
but
it
is
time
to
consider
the
subject
with
some
feeling
for
form
here
knowledge
of
the
structure
of
bones
and
muscles
that
underlie
the
skin
will
help
you
to
seize
on
those
things
that
are
significant
and
express
the
form
of
the

and
the
student
can
not
do
better
than
study
the
excellent
book

sir
alfred

notice
particularly
the
swing
of
the
action
such
things
as
the
pull
occasioned
by
the
arm
resting
on
the
farther
thigh
and
the
prominence
given
to
the
forms
by
the
straining
of
the
skin
at
the
shoulder
also
the
firm
lines
of
the
bent
back
and
the
crumpled
forms
of
the
front
of
the
body
notice
the
overlapping
of
the
contours
and
where
they
are
accentuated
and
where
more
lost
drawing
with
as
much
feeling
and
conviction
as
you
are
capable
of
you
will
have
for
some
time
to
work
tentatively
feeling
for
the
true
shapes
that
you
do
not
yet
rightly
see
but
as
soon
as
you
feel
any
confidence
remember
it
should
be
your
aim
to
express
yourself
freely
and
swiftly
there
is
a
tendency
in
some
quarters
to
discourage
this
blocking
in
of
the
forms
in
straight
lines
and
certainly
it
has
been
harmful
to
the
freedom
of
expression
in
the
work
of
some
students
they
not
only
begin
the
drawing
with
this
mechanical
blocking
in
but
continue
it
in
the
same
mechanical
fashion
cutting
up
almost
all
their
curves
into
flatnesses
and
never
once
breaking
free
from
this
scaffolding
to
indulge
in
the
enjoyment
of
free
line
expression
this
of
course
is
bad
and
yet
the
character
of
a
curved
line
is
hardly
to
be
accurately
studied
in
any
other
way
than
by
observing
its
relation
to
straight
lines
the
inclination
and
length
of
straight
lines
can
be
observed
with
certainty
but
a
curve
has
not
this
definiteness
and
is
a
very
unstable
thing
to
set
about
copying
unaided
who
but
the
highly
skilled
draughtsman
could
attempt
to
copy
our
random
shape
at
fig
x
page
transcribers
note
diagram
iv
without
any
guiding
straight
lines
and
even
the
highly
skilled
draughtsman
would
draw
such
straight
lines
mentally
so
that
some
blocking
out
of
the
curved
forms
either
done
practically
or
in
imagination
must
be
adopted
to
rightly
observe
any
shapes
but
do
not
forget
that
this
is
only
a
scaffolding
and
should
always
be
regarded
as
such
and
kicked
away
as
soon
as
real
form
expression
with
any
feeling
begins
but
it
will
be
some
years
before
the
beginner
has
got
his
eye
trained
to
such
accuracy
of
observation
that
he
can
dispense
with
it
sidenote
in
observe
shape
of
the
background
as
much
as
the
object
in
the
case
of
foreshortenings
the
eye
unaided
by
this
blocking
out
is
always
apt
to
be
led
astray
and
here
the
observation
of
the
shape
of
the
background
against
the
object
will
be
of
great
assistance
the
appearance
of
the
foreshortened
object
is
so
unlike
what
you
know
it
to
be
as
a
solid
thing
that
much
as
it
is
as
well
to
concentrate
the
attention
on
the
background
rather
than
on
the
form
in
this
process
and
in
fact
in
blocking
out
any
object
whether
foreshortened
or
not
the
shape
of
the
background
should
be
observed
as
carefully
as
any
other
shape
but
in
making
the
drawing
proper
the
forms
must
be
observed
in
their
inner
relations
that
is
to
say
the
lines
bounding
one
side
of
a
form
must
be
observed
in
relation
to
the
lines
bounding
the
other
side
as
the
true
expression
of
form
which
is
the
object
of
drawing
depends
on
the
true
relationship
of
these
boundaries
the
drawing
of
the
two
sides
should
be
carried
on
simultaneously
so
that
one
may
constantly
compare
them
sidenote
boundaries
a
series
of
overlappings
the
boundaries
of
forms
with
any
complexity
such
as
the
human
figure
are
not
continuous
lines
one
form
overlaps
another
like
the
lines
of
a
range
of
hills
and
this
overlapping
should
be
sought
for
and
carefully
expressed

outlines

made

at

the

in

it
will
be
observed
that
a
solid
object
has
some
portion
of
its
surface
in
light
while
other
portions
those
turned
away
from
the

are
in

are

the
parts

the
fact
that

not
upset
the
theory
that
it

be

from
points
where
the

can
equal
the

do

at

of
which
it
can
be

the
number
of

can

reflect
is
naturally
greatest
near

gets
gradually
less
as
the

the
point
is
reached
where
the

point
the

positively
turns

the
reflection
of

ceases
altogether
after

there
would
be
no
light
coming
to
the

from
the

were
it
not
that
it
receives

now
the
greatest

this

to
the

in
its
greatest
intensity
since
at

the

equal
the

the

should
not
have
troubled
the
reader
with
this
tedious
diagram
were
it
not
that
certain
facts
about
light
and
shade
can
be
learned
from
it
the
first
is
that
the
high
lights
come
much
more
within
the
edge
of
the
object
than
you
would
have
expected
with
the
light
directly
opposite
point
one
might
have
thought
the
highest
light
would
have
come
there
and
that
is
where
many
students
put
it
until
the
loss
of
roundness
in
the
appearance
of
their
work
makes
them
look
more
carefully
for
its
position
so
remember
always
to
look
out
for
high
lights
within
the
contours
of
forms
not
on
the
edges
the
next
thing
to
notice
is
that
the
darkest
part
of
the
shadow
will
come
nearest
the
lights
between
points
and
this
is
the
part
turned
most
away
from
the
direction
of
the
greatest
amount
of
reflected
light
and
therefore
receiving
least
the
lightest
part
of
the
shadow
will
be
in
the
middle
rather
towards
the
side
away
from
the
light
generally
speaking
the
shadow
cast
on
the
ground
will
be
dark
like
the
darkest
part
of
the
shadow
on
the
cone
as
its
surface
is
also
turned
away
from
the
chief
source
of
reflected
light
although
the
artist
will
very
seldom
be
called
upon
to
draw
a
cone
the
same
principles
of
light
and
shade
that
are
so
clearly
seen
in
such
a
simple
figure
obtain
throughout
the
whole
of
nature
this
is
why
the
much
abused
drawing
and
shading
from
whitened
blocks
and
pots
is
so
useful
nothing
so
clearly
impresses
the
general
laws
of
light
and
shade
as
this
dull
study
this
lightening
of
shadows
in
the
middle
by
reflected
light
and
darkening
towards
their
edges
is
a
very
important
thing
to
remember
the
heavy
smoky
look
students
early
work
is
so
prone
to
being
almost
entirely
due
to
their
neglect
through
ignorance
of
this
principle
nothing
is
more
awful
than
shadows
darker
in
the
middle
and
gradually
lighter
towards
their
edges
of
course
where
there
is
a
deep
hollow
in
the
shadow
parts
as
at
the
armpit
and
the
fold
at
the
navel
in
the
drawing
on
page
transcribers
note
plate
xviii
you
will
get
a
darker
tone
but
this
does
not
contradict
the
principle
that
generally
shadows
are
lighter
in
the
middle
and
darker
towards
the
edges
note
the
luminous
quality
the
observation
of
this
principle
gives
the
shadow
on
the
body
of
our
demonstration
drawing
this
is
a
crude
statement
of
the
general
principles
of
light
and
shade
on
a
simple
round
object
in
one
with
complex
surfaces
the
varieties
of
light
and
shade
are
infinite
but
the
same
principles
hold
good
the
surfaces
turned
more
to
the
source
of
light
receive
the
greatest
amount
and
are
the
lightest
and
from
these
parts
the
amount
of
light
lessens
through
what
are
called
the
half
tones
as
the
surface
turns
more
away
until
a
point
is
reached
where
no
more
direct

is
received
and
the

begin
and
in

the

law
applies
those
surfaces
turned

towards
the

light
will
receive
the
most
and

lessen

away
until
at
the
point
immediately
before
where
the

begin
the
amount
of

will
be
very
little
and
in
consequence
the
darkest
part
of
the
shadows
may
be
looked
for
there
may
of
course
be
other
sources
of
direct
light
on
the
shadow
side
that
will
entirely
alter
and
complicate
the
effect
or
one
may
draw
in
a
wide
diffused
light
such
as
is

in

in

it
is
advisable
to
draw
from

of

such

the
problem
is
complicated
by
the
different
tones
of
the
local
colour
in

drawing
it
is
as
well
to
take
as
little
notice
as
possible
of
these
variations
which
disturb
the
contemplation
of
pure
form
and
do
not
belong
to
the
particular
province
of
form
expression
with
which
drawing
is
concerned
although
one
has
selected
a
strong
half
light
and
half
shade
effect
to
illustrate
the
general
principles
of
light
and
shade
it
is
not
advisable
in
making
line
drawings
to
select
such
a
position
a
point
of
view
with
a
fairly
wide
light
at
your
back
is
the
best
in
this
position

will
be
seen

of

being
expressed
by

the

as
they
are
turned
away
from
the
light
will
naturally
be
darker

against

your

has
an
appearance
with
dark
edges
that
is
easily
expressed
by

line
drawing
is
the
beauty
of
contours
and
this
is
marred
by
heavy

and

great
draughtsmen
use
only
just
enough
to
express
the
form
but
never
to
attempt
the
expression
of
tone
think
of
the
half
tones
as
part
of
the
lights
and
not
as
part
of
the
shadows
there
are
many
different
methods
of
drawing
in
line
and
a
student
of
any
originality
will
find
one
that
suits
his
temperament
but
i
will
try
and
illustrate
one
that
is
at
any
rate
logical
and
that
may
serve
as
a
fair
type
of
line
drawing
generally
the
appearance
of
an
object
is
first
considered
as
a
series
of
contours
some
forming
the
boundaries
of
the
form
against
the
background
and
others
the
boundaries
of
the
subordinate
forms
within
these
bounding
lines
the
light
and
shade
and
differences
of
local
colour
like
the
lips
eyebrows
and
eyes
in
a
head
are
considered
together
as
tones
of
varying
degrees
of
lightness
and
darkness
and
suggested
by
means
of
lines
drawn
parallel
across
the
drawing
from
left
to
right
and
from
below
upwards
or
vice
versa
darker
and
closer
together
when
depth
is
wanted
and
fainter
and
further
apart
where
delicacy
is
demanded
and
varying
in
thickness
when
gradation
is
needed
this
rule
of
parallel
shading
is
broken
only
when
strongly
marked
forms
such
as
the
swing
lines
of
hair
a
prominent
bone
or
straining
muscles
demand
it
this
parallel
shading
gives
a
great
beauty
of
surface
and
fleshiness
to
a
drawing
the
lines
following
as
it
were
the
direction
of
the
light
across
the
object
rather
than
the
form
give
a
unity
that
has
a
great
charm
it
is
more
suited
to
drawings
where
extreme
delicacy
of
form
is
desired
and
is
usually
used

the

of

adds
considerably
to
the
force
of
the
relief
and
suggests
much
stronger
modelling
in
the
case
of
foreshortened
effects
where
the
forms
are
seen
at

arching
one
over
the

some
curvature
in
the
lines
of
shading
is
of
considerable
advantage
in
adding
to
the
foreshortened
look
lines
drawn
down
the
forms
give
an
appearance
of
great
strength
and
toughness
a
tense
look
and
this
quality
is
very
useful
in
suggesting
such
things
as
joints
and
sinews
rocks
hard
ground
or
gnarled
in
figure
drawing
it
is
an
interesting
quality
to
use
sparingly
with
the
shading
done
on
the
principle
and
to
suggest
a
difference
of
texture
or
a
straining
of
the
form

drawn
in

direction
crossing

is

work
and
is
seldom
necessary
in
pencil
or
chalk
drawing
as
they
are
more
concerned
with
form
than
atmosphere
pen
and
ink
is
more
often
used
for
elaborate
pictorial
effects
in
illustration
work
owing
to
the
ease
with
which
it
can
be
reproduced
and
printed
and
it
is
here
that
one
more
often
finds
this
muddled
quality
of
line
spots
being
used
to
fill
up
interstices
and
make
the
tone
even
speaking
generally
lines
of
shading
drawn
across
the
forms
suggest
softness
lines
drawn
in
curves
fulness
of
form
lines
drawn
down
the
forms
hardness
and
lines
crossing
in
all
directions
so
that
only
a
mystery
of
tone
results
atmosphere
and
if
these
four
qualities
of
line
be
used
judiciously
a
great
deal
of
expressive
power
is
added
to
your
shading
and
as
will
be
explained
in
the
next
chapter
somewhat
the
same
principle
applies
to
the
direction
of
the
swing
of
the
brush
in
painting
shading
lines
should
never
be
drawn
backwards
and
forwards
from
left
to
right
scribbled
except
possibly
where
a
mystery
of
shadow
is
wanted
and
the
lines
are
being
crossed
in
every
direction
but
never
when
lines
are
being
used
to
express
form
they
are
not
sufficiently
under
control
and
also
the
little
extra
thickness
that
occurs
at
the
turn
is
a
nuisance
the
crossing
of
lines
in
shading
gives
a
more
opaque
look
this
is
useful
to
suggest
the
opaque
appearance
of
the
darker
passage
that
occurs
in
that
part
of
a
shadow
nearest
the
lights
and
it
is
sometimes
used
in
the
half
tones
also
draughtsmen
vary
very
much
in
their
treatment
of
hair
and
different
qualities
of
hair
require
different
treatment
the
particular
beauty
of
it
that
belongs
to
point
drawing
is
the
swing
and
flow
of
its
lines
these
are
especially
apparent
in
the
lights
in
the
shadows
the
flow
of
line
often
stops
to
be
replaced
by
a
mystery
of
shadow
so
that
a
play
of
swinging
lines
alternating
with
shadow
passages
drawn
like
all
the
other
shadows
with
parallel
lines
not
following
the
form
is
often
effective
and
suggests
the
quality
of
hair
in
nature
the
swinging
lines
should
vary
in
thickness
along
their
course
getting
darker
as
they
pass
certain
parts
and
gradating
into
lighter
lines
at
other
parts

we
are

the
method
employed
for
most
of
the
drawings
by
the
author
in
this
book
the
lines
of
shading
are
made
parallel
in
a
direction
that
comes
easy
to
the
hand
unless
some
quality
in
the
form
suggests
their
following
other
directions
so
that
when
you
are
in
doubt
as
to
what
direction
they
should
follow
draw
them
on
the
parallel
principle
this
preserves
a
unity
in
your
work
and
allows
the
lines
drawn
in
other
directions
for
special
reasons
to
tell
expressively
as
has
already
been
explained
it
is
not
sufficient
in

concentrate
the

you

let

at

we
have
removed
the
skin

muscles
and
exposed
the
two
main
structural
features
in
the
form
of
the
eye
namely
the
bony
ring
of
the
socket
and
the
globe
containing
the
lenses
and
retina
examining
this
opening
we
find
from
a
to
b
that
it
runs
smoothly
into
the
bony
prominence
at
the
top
of
the
nose
and
that
the
rest
of
the
edge
is
sharp
and
from
point
c
to
e
quite
free
it
is
at
point
a
starting
from
a
little
hole
that
the
sharp
edge
begins
and
near
this
point
the
corner
of
the
eye
is
situated
a
figs
from
points
a
to
f
the
bony
edge
of
the
opening
is
very
near
the
surface
and
should
be
looked
for
the
next
thing
to
note
is
the
fact
that
the
eyebrow
at
first
follows
the
upper
edge
of
the
bony
opening
from
b
to
c
but
that
from
point
c
it
crosses
the
free
arch
between
c
and
d
and
soon
ends
so
that
considering
the
under
side
of
the
eyebrow
whereas
from
point
c
towards
b
there
is
usually
a
cavernous
hollow
from
c
towards
d
there
is
a
prominence
the
character
of
eyes
varies
greatly
and
this
effect
is
often
modified
by
the
fleshy
fulness
that
fills
in
the
space
between
the
eyelid
and
the
brow
but
some
indication
of
a
change
is
almost
always
to
be
observed
at
a
point
somewhere
about
c
and
should
be
looked
out
for
any
bony
prominence
from
this
point
towards
d
should
be
carefully
constructed
look
out
for
the
bone
therefore
between
the
points
cd
and
af
never
forget
when
painting
an
eye
that
what
we
call
the
white
of
the
eye
is
part
of
a
sphere
and
will
therefore
have
the
light
and
shade
of
a
sphere
it
will
seldom
be
the
same
tone
all
over
if
the
light
is
coming
from
the
right
it
will
be
in
shade
towards
the
left
and
vice
versa
also
the
eyelids
are
bands
of
flesh
placed
on
this
spherical
surface
they
will
therefore
partake
of
the
modelling
of
the
sphere
and
not
be
the
same
tone
all
across
note
particularly
the
sudden
change
of
plane
usually
marked
by
a
fold
where
the
under
eyelid
meets
the
surface
coming
from
the
cheek
bone
the
neglect
to
construct
these
planes
of
the
under
eyelid
is
a
very
common
fault
in
poorly
painted
eyes
note
also
where
the
upper
eyelid
comes
against
the
flesh
under
the
eyebrow
usually
a
strongly
marked
fold
and
the
differences
of
planes
that
occur
at
this
juncture
in
some
eyes
when
there
is
little
loose
flesh
above
the
eyelid
there
is
a
deep
hollow
here
the
eyelid
running
up
under
the
bony
prominence
c
this
is
an
important
structural
line
marking
as
it
does
the
limit
of
the
spherical
surface
of
the
eyeball
on
which
surface
the
eyelids
are
placed
fig
is
a
rough
diagram
of
the
direction
it
is
usual
for
the
hairs
forming
the
eyebrow
to
take
from
a
a
few
scant
hairs
start
radiating
above
the
nose
and
quite
suddenly
reach
their
thickest
and
strongest
growth
between
b
and
they
continue
still
following
a
slightly
radiating
course
until
these
hairs
are
now
met
by
another
lot
starting
from
above
downwards
and
growing
from
b
to
an
eyebrow
is
considered
by
the
draughtsman
as
a
tone
of
a
certain
shape
and
qualities
of
edge
and
what
interests
us
here
is
to
note
the
effect
of
this
order
of
growth
upon
its
appearance
as
tone
the
meeting
of
the
strong

if

put

by
scumbling
is
meant
rubbing
the
colour
into

working
the

from

side
rapidly
and
laying
just
the
thinnest
solid
tone
that
will
cover
the

if
this
is
properly
done
and
your
drawing
was
well
fixed
you
will
just
be
able
to
see
it
through
the

now
mix
up
a
tone
equal
to
the
highest
lights
on
the
cast
and
map
out
simply
the
shapes
of
the
light
masses
on
your
study
leaving
the
scumbled
tone
for
the
half
tones
note
carefully
where
the
light
masses
come
sharply
against
the
half
tones
and
where
they
merge
softly
into
them
you
will
find
that
the
scumbled
tone
of
your
ground
will
mix
with
the
tone
of
the
lights
with
which
you
are
painting
and
darken
it
somewhat
this
will
enable
you
to
get
the
amount
of
variety
you
want
in
the
tone
of
the
lights
the
thicker
you
paint
the
lighter
will
be
the
tone
while
the
thinner
paint
will
be
more
affected
by
the
original
half
tone
and
will
consequently
be
darker
when
this
is
done
mix
up
a
tone
equal
to
the
darkest
shadow
and
proceed
to
map
out
the
shadows
in
the
same
way
as
you
did
the
lights
noting
carefully
where
they
come
sharply
against
the
half
tone
and
where
they
are
lost
in
the
case
of
the
shadows
the
thicker
you
paint
the
darker
will
be
the
tone
and
the
thinner
the
lighter
when
the
lights
and
shadows
have
been
mapped
out
if
this
has
been
done
with
any
accuracy
your
work
should
be
well
advanced
and
it
now
remains
to
correct
and
refine
it
here
and
there
as
you
feel
it
wants
it
place
your
work
alongside
the
cast
and
walk
back
to
correct
it
faults
that
are
not
apparent
when
close
are
easily
seen
at
a
little
distance
i
do
suggest
that
this
is
the
right
or
only
way
of
painting
but
i
do
suggest
that
exercises
of
this
description
will
teach
the
student
many
of
the
rudimentary
essentials
of
painting
such
elementary
things
as
how
to
lay
a
tone
how
to
manage
a
brush
how
to
resolve
appearances
into
a
simple
structure
of
tones
and
how
to
manipulate
your
paint
so
as
to
express
the
desired
shape
this
elementary
paint
drawing
is
as
far
as
i
know
never
given
as
an
exercise
the
study
of
drawing
at
present
being
confined
to
paper
and
charcoal
or
chalk
mediums
drawing
in
charcoal
is
the
nearest
thing
to
this
paint
drawing
it
being
a
sort
of
mixed
method
half
line
and
half
mass
drawing
but
although
allied
to
painting
it
is
a
very
different
thing
from
expressing
form
with
paint
and
no
substitute
for
some
elementary
exercise
with
the
brush
the
use
of
charcoal
to
the
neglect
of
line
drawing
often
gets
the
student
into
a
sloppy
manner
of
work
and
is
not
so
good
a
training
to
the
eye
and
hand
in
clear
definite
statement
its
popularity
is
no
doubt
due
to
the
fact
that
you
can
get
much
effect
with
little
knowledge
although
this
painting
into
a
middle
tone
is
not
by
any
means
the
only
method
of
painting
i
do
feel
that
it
is
the
best
method
for
studying
form
expression
with
the
brush
but
when
you
come
to
colour
the
fact
of
the
opaque
middle
tone
or
half
tone
being
first
painted
over
the
whole
will
spoil
the
clearness
and
transparency
of
your
shadows
and
may
also
interfere
with
the
brilliancy
of
the
colour
in
the
lights
when
colour
comes
to
be
considered
it
may
be
necessary
to
adopt
many
expedients
that
it
is
as
well
not
to
trouble
too
much
about
until
a
further
stage
is
reached
but
there
is
no
necessity
for
the
half
tone
to
be
painted
over
the
shadows
in
working
in
colour
the
half
tone
or
middle
tone
of
the
lights
can
be
made
and
a
middle
tone
of
the
shadows
and
these
two
first
painted
separately
the
edges
where
they
come
together
being
carefully
studied
and
finished
afterwards
the
variety
of
tone
in
the
lights
and
the
shadows
can
be
added
by
this
means
the
difference
in
the
quality
of
the
colour
between
lights
and
shadows
is
preserved
this
is
an
important
consideration
as
there
is
generally
a
strong
contrast
between
them
the
shadows
usually
being
warm
if
the
lights
are
cool
and
vice
versa
and
such
contrasts
greatly
affect
the
vitality
of
colouring
try
always
to
do
as
much
as
possible
with
one
stroke
of
the
brush
paint
has
a
vitality
when
the
touches
are
deft
that
much
handling
and
continual
touching
kills
look
carefully
at
the
shape
and
variety
of
the
tone
you
wish
to
express
and
try
and
manipulate
the
swing
of
your
brush
in
such
a
way
as
to
get
in
one
touch
as
near
the
quality
of
shape
and
gradation
you
want
remember
that
the
lightest
part
of
your
touch
will
be
where
the
brush
first
touches
the
canvas
when
you
are
painting
lights
into
a
middle
tone
and
that
as
the
amount
of
paint
in
the
brush
gets
less
so
the
tone
will
be
more
affected
by
what
you
are
painting
into
and
get
darker
and
in
painting
the
shadows
the
darkest
part
of
your
stroke
will
be
where
the
brush
first
touches
the
canvas
and
it
will
gradually
lighten
as
the
paint
in
your
brush
gets
less
and
therefore
more
affected
by
the
tone
you
are
painting
into
if
your
brush
is
very
full
it
will
not
be
influenced
nearly
so
much
and
if
one
wants
a
touch
that
shall
be
distinct
as
would
be
the
case
in
painting
the
shiny
light
on
a
glazed
pot
a
very
full
brush
would
be
used
but
generally
speaking
get
your
effects
with
as
little
paint
as
possible
thinner
paint
is
easier
to
refine
and
manipulate
there
will
be
no
fear
of
its
not
being
solid
if
you
are
painting
into
a
solidly
scumbled
middle
tone
many
charming
things
are
to
be
done
with
a
mixture
of
solid
and
transparent
paint
but
it
is
well
at
first
not
to
complicate
the
problem
too
much
and
therefore
to
leave
this
until
later
on
when
you
are
competent
to
attack
problems
of
colour
keep
your
early
work
both
in
monochrome
and
colour
quite
solid
but
as
thin
as
you
can
reserving
thicker
paint
for
those
occasions
when
you
wish
to
put
a
touch

shall
not
be

a

of
the
different
brush
strokes
and
say
something
about
the
different
qualities
of
each
these
are
only
given
as
typical
examples
of
the
innumerable
ways
a
brush
may
be
used
as
an
aid
to
very
elementary
students
every
artist
will
of
course
develop
ways
of
his
own
the
touch
will
of
necessity
depend
in
the
first
instance
upon
the
shape
of
the
brush
and
these
shapes
are
innumerable
but
there
are
two
classes
into
which
they
can
roughly
be
divided
flat
and
round
the
round
brushes
usually
sold
which
we
will
call
class
a
have
rather
a
sharp
point
and
this
although
helpful
in
certain
circumstances
is
against
their
general
usefulness
but
a
round
brush
with
a
round
point
is
also
made
and
this
is
much
more
convenient
for
mass
drawing
where
there
is
a
sharp
point
the
central
hairs
are
much
longer
and
consequently
when
the
brush
is
drawn
along
and
pressed
so
that
all
the
hairs
are
touching
the
canvas
the
pressure
in
the
centre
where
the
long
hairs
are
situated
is
different
from
that
at
the
sides
this
has
the
effect
of
giving
a
touch
that
is
not
equal
in
quality
all
across
and
the
variety
thus
given
is
difficult
to
manipulate
i
should
therefore
advise
the
student
to
try
the
round
brushes
first
as
they
give
a
much
more
even
touch
and
one
much
more
suited
to
painting
in
planes
of
tone
the
most
extreme
flat
brushes
class
b
are
thin
and
rather
short
with
sharp
square
ends
and
have
been
very
popular
with
students
they
can
be
relied
upon
to
give
a
perfectly
flat
even
tone
but
with
a
rather
hard
sharp
edge
at
the
sides
and
also
at
the
commencement
of
the
touch
in
fact
they
make
touches
like
little
square
bricks
but
as
the
variety
that
can
be
got
out
of
them
is
limited
and
the
amount
of
paint
they
can
carry
so
small
that
only
short
strokes
can
be
made
they
are
not
the
best
brush
for
general
use
they
are
at
times
when
great
refinement
and
delicacy
are
wanted
very
useful
but
are
on
the
whole
poor
tools
for
the
draughtsman
in
paint
some
variety
can
be
got
by
using
one
or
other
of
their
sharp
corners
by
which
means
the
smallest
possible
touch
can
be
made
to
begin
with
which
can
be
increased
in
size
as
more
pressure
is
brought
to
bear
until
the

of

is
brought
into

a
variety
of
touches
have
been
made
in
turn
by
these
different
shaped
brushes
in
all
the
strokes
illustrated
it
is
assumed
that
the
brush
is
moderately
full
of
paint
of
a
consistency
a
little
thinner
than
that
usually
put
up
by
colourmen
to
thin
it
mix
a
little
turpentine
and
linseed
oil
in
equal
parts
with
it
and
get
it
into
easy
working
consistency
before
beginning
your
work
so
as
not
to
need
any
medium
in
the
first
column
no
a
touch
firmly
painted
with
an
equal
pressure
all
along
its
course
is
given
this
gives
you
a
plane
of
tone
with
firm
edges
the
width
of
your
brush
getting
gradually
darker
or
lighter
as
your
brush
empties
according
to
the
length
of
the
stroke
and
to
whether
you
are
painting
into
a
lighter
or
darker
ground
in
column
no
a
drag
touch
is
illustrated
this
is
a
very
useful
one
the
brush
is
placed
firmly
on
the
canvas
and
then
dragged
from
the
point
lightly
away
leaving
a
gradated
tone
a
great
deal
of
the
modelling
in
round
objects
is
to
be
expressed
by
this
variety
of
handling
the
danger
is
that
its
use
is
apt
to
lead
to
a
too
dexterous
manner
of
painting
a
dexterity
more
concerned
with
the
clever
manner
in
which
a
thing
is
painted
than
with
the
truth
expressed
column
no
this
is
a
stroke
lightly
and
quickly
painted
where
the
brush
just
grazes
the
surface
of
the
canvas
the
paint
is
put
on
in
a
manner
that
is
very
brilliant
and
at
the
same
time
of
a
soft
quality
if
the
brush
is
only
moderately
full
such
touches
will
not
have
any
hard
edges
but
be
of
a
light
feathery
nature
it
is
a
most
useful
manner
of
putting
on
paint
when
freshness
of
colour
is
wanted
as
it
prevents
one
tone
being
churned
up
with
another
and
losing
its
purity
and
in
the
painting
of
hair
where
the
tones
need
to
be
kept
very
separate
and
at
the
same
time
not
hard
it
is
very
useful
but
in
monochrome
painting
from
the
cast
it
is
of
very
little
service
another
method
of
using
a
brush
is
hatching
the
drawing
of
rows
of
parallel
lines
in
either
equal
or
varying
thicknesses
this
method
will
lighten
or
darken
a
tone
in
varying
degree
according
to
whether
the
lines
are
thick
thin
or
gradated
somewhat
in
the
same
way
that
lines
of
shading
are
drawn
in
line
work
in
cases
where
the
correction
of
intricate
modelling
is
desired
and
where
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
alter
a
part
accurately
by
a
deft
stroke
of
the
brush
this
method
is
useful
to
employ
a
dry
brush
can
be
drawn
across
the
lines
to
unite
them
with
the
rest
of
the
work
afterwards
this
method
of
painting
has
lately
been
much
used
by
those
artists
who
have
attempted
painting
in
separate
pure
colours
after
the
manner
of
claude
monet
although
so
mechanical
a
method
is
seldom
used
by
that
master
as
your
power
of
drawing
increases
from
the
line
drawing
you
have
been
doing
casts
of
hands
and
heads
should
be
attempted
in
the
same
manner
as
has
been
described
illustrations
are
given
of
exercises
of
this
description
on
pages
and
unfortunately
the
photographs
which
were
taken
from
the
same
study
at
different
stages
during
the
painting
are
not
all
alike
the
first
painting
of
the
lights
being
too
darkly
printed
in
some
cases
but
they
show
how
much
can
be
expressed
with
the
one
tone
when
variety
is
got
by
using
the
middle
tone
to
paint
into
the
two
tones
used
are
noted
in
the
lower
corner
try
to
train
yourself
to
do
these
studies
at
one
sitting
but
if
you
find
you
can
not
manage
this
use
slower
drying
colours
say
bone
brown
and
zinc
white
which
will
keep
wet
until
the
next
day
when
you
begin
studying
from
the
life
proceed
in
the
same
way
with
monochrome
studies
painted
into
a
middle
tone
and
what
are
you
to
do
if
you
find
when
you
have
finished
that
it
is
all
wrong
i
should
advise
you
to
let
it
dry
and
then
scumble
a
middle
tone
right
over
the
whole
thing
as
you
did
at
first
which
will
show
the
old
work
through
and
you
can
then
correct
your
drawing
and
proceed
to
paint
the
lights
and
shadows
as
before
and
if
only
a
part
of
it
is
wrong
when
it
is
quite
dry
rub
a
little
poppy
oil
thinned
with
turpentine
over
the
work
as
little
as
will
serve
to
cover
the
surface
if
it
is
found
difficult
to
get
it
to
cover
breathe
on
the
canvas
the
slightest
moisture
will
help
it
to
bite
when
this
is
done
wipe
it
off
with
the
palm
of
your
hand
or
an
old
piece
of
clean
linen
now
paint
a
middle
tone
right
over
the
part
you
wish
to
retouch
being
careful
about
joining
it
up
to
the
surrounding
work
and
proceed
as
before
drawing
in
the
light
and
shadow
masses
this
form
of
drawing
you
will
probably
find
more
difficult
at
first
for
the
reason
already
explained
it
seems
natural
to
observe
objects
as
made
up
of
outlines
not
masses
the
frame
with
cottons
across
it
should
be
used
to
flatten
the
appearance
as
in
making
outline
drawings
and
besides
this
a
black
glass
should
be
used
this
can
easily
be
made
by
getting
a
small
piece
of
glass
a
photographic
negative
will
do
and
sticking
some
black
paper
on
the
back
turning
it
over
the
front
to
keep
the
raw
edges
of
the
glass
from
cutting
the
fingers
or
the
glass
can
be
painted
on
the
back
with
black
paint
standing
with
your
back
to
the
object
and
your
painting
hold
this
glass
close
in
front
of
one
of
your
eyes
the
other
being
closed
so
that
you
can
see
both
your
painting
and
the
object
seeing
the
tones
thus
reduced
and
simplified
you
will
be
enabled
more
easily
to
correct
your
work
i
should
like
to
emphasise
the
importance
of
the
work
necessary
for
while
it
is
not
necessary
to
put
expressive
work
into
this
preparatory
work
the
utmost
care
should
be
taken
to
ensure
its
accuracy
as
far
as
it
goes
it
is
a
great
nuisance
if
after
you
have
put
up
some
of
your
fair
structure
you
find
the
foundations
are
in
the
wrong
place
and
the
whole
thing
has
to
be
torn
down
and
shifted
it
is
of
the
utmost
necessity
to
have
the
proportions
and
the
main
masses
settled
at
this
early
stage
and
every
device
of
blocking
out
with
square
lines
and
measuring
with
your
should
be
adopted
to
ensure
the
accuracy
of
these
large
proportions
the
variations
and
emphases
that
feeling
may
dictate
can
be
done
in
the
painting
stage
this
initial
stage
is
not
really
a
drawing
at
all
but
a
species
of
mapping
out
and
as
such
it
should
be
regarded
the
only
excuse
for
making
the
elaborate
preparatory
drawings
on
canvas
students
sometimes
do
is
that
it
enables
them
to
learn
the
subject
so
that
when
they
come
to
paint
it
they
already
know
something
about
it
but
the
danger
of
making
these
preparatory
drawings
interesting
is
that
the
student
fears
to
cover
them
up
and
lose
an
outline
so
carefully
and
lovingly
wrought
and
this
always
results
in
a
poor
painting
when
you
take
up
a
brush
to
express
yourself
it
must
be
with
no
fear
of
hurting
a
careful
drawing
your
drawing
is
going
to
be
done
with
the
brush
and
only
the
general
setting
out
of
the
masses
will
be
of
any
use
to
you
in
the
work
of
this
initial
stage
never
paint
with
the
poor
spirit
of
the
student
who
fears
to
lose
his
drawing
or
you
will
never
do
any
fine
things
in
painting
drawing
expressing
form
is
the
thing
you
should
be
doing
all
the
time
and
in
art
he
that
would
save
his
work
must
often
lose
it
if
you
will
excuse
the
paraphrase
of
a
profound
saying
which
like
most
profound
sayings
is
applicable
to
many
things
in
life
besides
what
it
originally
referred
to
it
is
often
necessary
when
a
painting
is
nearly
right
to
destroy
the
whole
thing
in
order
to
accomplish
the
apparently
little
that
still
divides
it
from
what
you
conceive
it
should
be
it
is
like
a
man
rushing
a
hill
that
is
just
beyond
the
power
of
his
to
climb
he
must
take
a
long
run
at
it
and
if
the
first
attempt
lands
him
nearly
up
at
the
top
but
not
quite
he
has
to
go
back
and
take
the
long
run
all
over
again
to
give
him
the
impetus
that
shall
carry
him
right
through
another
method
of
judging
tone
drawing
is
our
old
method
of
half
closing
the
eyes
this
by
lowering
the
tone
and
widening
the
focus
enables
you
to
correct
the
work
more
easily
in
tone
drawing
there
is
not
only
the
shape
of
the
masses
to
be
considered
but
their
values
that
is
their
position
in
an
imagined
scale
from
dark
to
light
the
relation
of
the
different
tones
in
this
way
the
values
as
it
is
called
is
an
extremely
important
matter
in
painting
but
it
more
properly
belongs
to
the
other
department
of
the
subject
namely
colour
and
this
needs
a
volume
to
itself
but
something
more
will
be
said
on
this
subject
when
treating
of
rhythm
we
saw
in
speaking
of
line
drawing
how
the
character
of
a
line
was
found
by
observing
its
flatnesses
and
its
relation
to
straight
lines
in
the
same
way
the
character
of
modelling
is
found
by
observing
its
planes
so
that
in
building
up
a
complicated
piece
of
form
like
a
head
or
figure
the
planes
or
flat
tones
should
be
sought
for
everywhere
as
a
carver
in
stone
blocks
out
his
work
in
square
surfaces
the
modelling
of
a
figure
or
any
complex
surface
that
is
being
studied
should
be
set
out
in
planes
of
tone
painting
in
the
first
instance
the
larger
ones
and
then
to
these
adding
the
smaller
when
it
will
be
seen
that
the
roundnesses
have
with
a
little
fusing
of
edges
here
and
there
been
arrived
at
good
modelling
is
full
of
these
planes
subtly
fused
together
nothing
is
so
characteristic
of
bad
modelling
as
gross
roundnesses
the
surface
of
a
sphere
is
the
surface
with
the
least
character
like
the
curve
of
a
circle
and
the
one
most
to
be
avoided
in
good
modelling
in
the
search
for
form
the
knowledge
of
anatomy
and
particularly
the
bony
structures
is
of
the
utmost
importance
during
the
rage
for
realism
and
naturalism
many
hard
things
were
said
about
the
study
of
anatomy
and
certainly
were
it
to
be
used
to
overstep
the
modesty
of
nature
in
these
respects
and
to
be
paraded
to
the
exclusion
of
the
charm
and
character
of
life
it
would
be
as
well
left
alone
but
if
we
are
to
make
a
drawing
that
shall
express
something
concrete
we
must
know
something
of
its
structure
whatever
it
is
in
the
case
of
the
human
figure
it
is
impossible
properly
to
understand
its
action
and
draw
it
in
a
way
that
shall
give
a
powerful
impression
without
a
knowledge
of
the
mechanics
of
its
construction
but
i
hardly
think
the
case
for
anatomy
needs
much
stating
at
the
present
time
never
let
anatomical
knowledge
tempt
you
into
exaggerated
statements
of
internal
structure
unless
such
exaggeration
helps
the
particular
thing
you
wish
to
express
in
drawing
a
figure
in
violent
action
it
might
for
instance
be
essential
to
the
drawing
whereas
in
drawing
a
figure
at
rest
or
a
portrait
it
would
certainly
be
out
of
place

xlix
the
work
of
henner
in
france
is
an
extreme
instance
of
the
quality
of
softness
and
fleshiness
got
by
painting
across
the
form
the
look
of
toughness
and
hardness
given
by
the
brush
work
following
down
the
forms
is
well
illustrated
in
much
of
the
work
of
james
ward
the
animal
painter
in
his
picture
in
the
national
gallery
harlech
castle
no
this
can
be
seen
in
the
painting
of
the
the
crossing
of
the
brush
work
in
every
direction
giving
a
look
of
atmosphere
is
naturally
often
used
in
painting
backgrounds
and
also
such
things
as
the
plane
surfaces
of
sky
and
mist
it
is
often
inconvenient
to
paint
across
the
form
when
softness
is
wanted
it
is
only
possible
to
have
one
colour
in
your
brush
sweep
and
the
colour
changes
across
much
more
than
down
the
form
as
a
rule
for
the
shadows
half
tones
and
lights
besides
varying
in
tone
vary
also
in
colour
so
that
it
is
not
always
possible
to
sweep
across
them
with
one
colour
it
is
usually
more
convenient
to
paint
down
where
the
colours
can
be
laid
in
overlapping
bands
of
shadow
half
tone
and
light
nevertheless
if
this
particular
look
of
softness
and
fleshiness
is
desired
either
the
painting
must
be
so
thin
or
the
tones
so
fused
together
that
no
brush
strokes
show
or
a
dry
flat
brush
must
afterwards
be
drawn
lightly
across
when
the
painting
is
done
to
destroy
the
downward
brush
strokes
and
substitute
others
going
across
great
care
being
taken
to
drag
only
from
light
to
dark
and
to
wipe
the
brush
carefully
after
each
touch
and
also
never
to
go
over
the
same
place
twice
or
the
paint
will
lose
vitality
this
is
a
method
much
employed
by
artists
who
delight
in
this
particular
quality
but
when
a
strong
tough
look
is
desired
such
as
one
sees
when
a
muscle
is
in
violent
action
or
in
the
tendon
above
the
wrist
or
above
the
heel
in
the
leg
or
generally
where
a
bone
comes
to
the
surface
in
all
these
cases
the
brush
work
should
follow
down
the
forms
it
is
not
necessary
and
is
often
inadvisable
for
the
brush
work
to
show
at
all
in
which
case
these
principles
will
be
of
little
account
but
when
in
vigorously
painted
work
they
do
i
think
it
will
generally
be
found
to
create
the
effects

drawing
on
toned
paper
with
white
chalk
or
chinese
white
and
black
or
red
chalk
is
another
form
of
mass
drawing
and
for
studies
it
is
intended
to
paint
from
this
is
a
quick
and
excellent
manner
the
rapidity
with
which
the
facts
of
an
appearance
can
be
noted
makes
it
above
all
others
the
method
for
drapery
studies
the
lights
are
drawn
with
white
the
toned
paper
being
allowed
to
show
through
where
a
darker
tone
is
needed
the
white
either
chalk
or
chinese
white
being
put
on
thickly
when
a
bright
light
is
wanted
and
thinly
where
a
quieter
light
is
needed
so
with
the
shadows
the
chalk
is
put
on
heavily
in
the
darks
and
less
heavily
in
the
lighter
shadows
since
the
days
of
the
early
italians
this
has
been
a
favourite
method
of
drawing

some
artists
have
shaded
their

the
late

edward
was
very
fond
of
this
and
drawings
with

have
been
done
this

the
principle
is

x
rhythm
the
subject
of
rhythm
in
what
are
called
the
fine
arts
is
so
vague
and
has
received
so
little
attention
that
some
courage
or
perhaps
foolhardiness
is
needed
to
attack
it
and
in
offering
the
following
fragmentary
ideas
that
have
been
stumbled
on
in
my
own
limited
practice
i
want
them
to
be
accepted
only
for
what
they
are
worth
as
i
do
not
know
of
any
proper
authority
for
them
but
they
may
serve
as
a
stimulus
and
offer
some
lines
on
which
the
student
can
pursue
the
subject
for
himself
the
word
rhythm
is
here
used
to
signify
the
power
possessed
by
lines
tones
and
colours
by
their
ordering
and
arrangement
to
affect
us
somewhat
as
different
notes
and
combinations
of
sound
do
in
music
and
just
as
in
music
where
sounds
affect
us
without
having
any
direct
relation
with
nature
but
appeal
directly
to
our
own
inner
life
so
in
painting
sculpture
and
architecture
there
is
a
music
that
appeals
directly
to
us
apart
from
any
significance
that
may
be
associated
with
the
representation
of
natural
phenomena
there
is
as
it
were
an
abstract
music
of
line
tone
and
colour
the
danger
of
the
naturalistic
movement
in
painting
in
the
nineteenth
century
has
been
that
it
has
turned
our
attention
away
from
this
fundamental
fact
of
art
to
the
contemplation
of
interesting
realisations
of
appearances
realisations
often
full
of
poetic
suggestiveness
due
to
associations
connected
with
the
objects
painted
as
concrete
things
but
not
always
made
directly
significant
as
artistic
expression
whereas
it
is
the
business
of
the
artist
to
relate
the
form
colour
and
tone
of
natural
appearances
to
this
abstract
musical
quality
with
which
he
should
never
lose
touch
even
in
the
most
highly
realised
detail
of
his
work
for
only
thus
when
related
to
rhythm
do
the
form
tone
and
colour
of
appearances
obtain
their
full
expressive
power
and
become
a
means
of
vitally
conveying
the
feeling
of
the
artist
inquiry
as
to
the
origin
of
this
power
and
of
rhythm
generally
is
a
profoundly
interesting
subject
and
now
that
recent
advances
in
science
tend
to
show
that
sound
heat
light
and
possibly
electricity
and
even
nerve
force
are
but
different
rhythmic
forms
of
energy
and
that
matter
itself
may
possibly
be
resolved
eventually
into
different
rhythmic
motions
it
does
look
as
if
rhythm
may
yet
be
found
to
contain
even
the
secret
of
life
itself
at
any
rate
it
is
very
intimately
associated
with
life
and
primitive
man
early
began
to
give
expression
in
some
form
of
architecture
sculpture
or
painting
to
the
deeper
feelings
that
were
moving
him
found
some
correspondence
between
the
lines
and
colours
of
architecture
sculpture
and
painting
and
the
emotional
life
that
was
awakening
within
him
thus
looking
back
at
the
remains
of
their
work
that
have
come
down
to
us
we
are
enabled
to
judge
of
the
nature
of
the
people
from
the
expression
we
find
in
hewn
stone
and
on
painted
walls
it
is
in
primitive
art
generally
that
we
see
more
clearly
the
direct
emotional
significance
of
line
and
form
art
appears
to
have
developed
from
its
most
abstract
position
to
which
bit
by
bit
have
been
added
the
truths
and
graces
of
natural
appearance
until
as
much
of
this
naturalistic
truth
has
been
added
as
the
abstract
significance
at
the
base
of
the
expression
could
stand
without
loss
of
power
at
this
point
as
has
already
been
explained
a
school
is
at
the
height
of
its
development
the
work
after
this
usually
shows
an
increased
concern
with
naturalistic
truth
which
is
always
very
popular
to
the
gradual
exclusion
of
the
backbone
of
abstract
line
and
form
significance
that
dominated
the
earlier
work
and
when
these
primitive
conditions
are
lost
touch
with
a
decadence
sets
in
at
least
this
is
roughly
the
theory
to
which
a
study
of
the
two
great
art
developments
of
the
past
in
greece
and
italy
would
seem
to
point
and
this
theory
is
the
excuse
for
all
the
attempts
at
primitivism
of
which
we
have
lately
seen
so
much
art
having
lost
touch
with
its
primitive
base
owing
to
the
of
naturalism
it
has
had
we
must
these
new
apostles
say
find
a
new
primitive
base
on
which
to
build
the
new
structure
of
art
the
theory
has
its
attractions
but
there
is
this
difference
between
the
primitive
archaic
greek
or
early
italian
and
the
modern
primitive
the
early
men
reverently
clothed
the
abstract
idea
they
started
with
in
the
most
natural
and
beautiful
form
within
their
knowledge
ever
seeking
to
discover
new
truths
and
graces
from
nature
to
enrich
their
work
while
the
modern
artist
with
the
art
treasures
of
all
periods
of
the
world
before
him
can
never
be
in
the
position
of
these
men
it
is
therefore
unlikely
that
the
future
development
of
art
will
be
on
lines
similar
to
that
of
the
past
the
same
conditions
of
simple
ignorance
are
never
likely
to
occur
again
means
of
communication
and
prolific
reproduction
make
it
very
unlikely
that
the
art
of
the
world
will
again
be
lost
for
a
season
as
was
greek
art
in
the
middle
ages
interesting
intellectually
as
is
the
theory
that
the
impressionist
point
of
view
the
accepting
of
the
flat
retina
picture
as
a
pattern
of
colour
sensations
offers
a
new
field
from
which
to
select
material
for
a
new
basis
of
artistic
expression
so
far
the
evidence
of
results
has
not
shown
anything
likely
seriously
to
threaten
the
established
principles
of
traditional
design
and
anything
more
different
in
spirit
from
the
genuine
primitive
than
the
irreverent
anarchy
and
flouting
of
all
refinement
in
the
work
of
some
of
these
new
primitives
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
but
much
of
the
work
of
the
movement
has
undoubted
artistic
vitality
and
in
its
insistence
on
design
and
selection
should
do
much
to
kill
realism
and
the
copying
nature
theory
of
a
few
years
back
although
it
is
perfectly
true
that
the
feelings
and
ideas
that
impel
the
artist
may
sooner
or
later
find
their
own
expression
there
are
a
great
many
principles
connected
with
the
arranging
of
lines
tones
and
colours
in
his
picture
that
it
is
difficult
to
transgress
without
calamity
at
any
rate
the
knowledge
of
some
of
them
will
aid
the
artist
in
gaining
experience
and
possibly
save
him
some
needless
fumbling
but
do
for
one
moment
think
that
anything
in
the
nature
of
rules
is
going
to
take
the
place
of
the
initial
artistic
impulse
which
must
come
from
within
this
is
not
a
matter
for
teaching
art
training
being
only
concerned
with
perfecting
the
means
of
its

my
pride

with
my

it
is
proposed
to
treat
the
subject
from
the
material
side
of
line
and
tone
only
without
any
reference
to
subject
matter
with
the
idea
of
trying
to
find
out
something
about
the
expressive
qualities
line
and
tone
are
capable
of
yielding
unassociated
with
visual
things
what
use
can
be
made
of
any
such
knowledge
to
give
expression
to
the
emotional
life
of
the
artist
is
not
our
concern
and
is
obviously
a
matter
for
the
individual
to
decide
for
himself
there
is
at
the
basis
of
every
picture
a
structure
of
lines
and
masses
they
may
not
be
very
obvious
and
may
be
hidden
under
the
most
broken
of
techniques
but
they
will
always
be
found
underlying
the
planning
of
any
painting
some
may
say
that
the
lines
are
only
the
boundaries
of
the
masses
and
others
that
the
masses
are
only
the
spaces
between
the
lines
but
whichever
way
you
care
to
look
at
it
there
are
particular
emotional
qualities
analogous
to
music
that
affect
us
in
lines
and
line
arrangements
and
also
in
tone
or
mass
arrangements
and
any
power
a
picture
may
have
to
move
us
will
be
largely
due
to
the
rhythmic
significance
of
this
original
planning
these
qualities
as
has
already
been
stated
affect
us
quite
apart
from
any
association
they
may
have
with
natural
things
arrangements
of
mere
geometrical
lines
are
sufficient
to
suggest
them
but
of
course
other
associations
connected
with
the
objects
represented
will
largely
augment
the
impression
when
the
line
and
tone
arrangements
and
the
sentiment
of
the
object
are
in
sympathy
and
if
they
are
not
it
may
happen
that
associations
connected
with
the
representation
will
cut
in
and
obscure
or
entirely
destroy
this
line
and
tone
music
that
is
to
say
if
the
line
and
tone
arrangement
in
the
abstract
is
expressive
of
the
sublime
and
the
objects
whose
representation
they
support
something
ridiculous
say
a
donkey
braying
the
associations
aroused
by
so
ridiculous
an
appearance
will
override
those
connected
with
the
line
and
tone
arrangement
but
it
is
remarkable
how
seldom
this
occurs
in
nature
the
sentiment
of
the
line
and
tone
arrangements
things
present
being
usually
in
harmony
with
the
sentiment
of
the
object
itself
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
line
effect
of
a
donkey
in
repose
is
much
more
sublime
than
when
he
is
braying
sidenote
unity
and
variety
there
are
two
qualities
that
may
be
allowed
to
divide
the
consideration
of
this
subject
two
points
of
view
from
which
the
subject
can
be
approached
unity
and
variety
qualities
somewhat
opposed
to
each
other
as
are
harmony
and
contrast
in
the
realm
of
colour
unity
is
concerned
with
the
relationship
of
all
the
parts
to
that
oneness
of
conception
that
should
control
every
detail
of
a
work
of
art
all
the
more
profound
qualities
the
deeper
emotional
notes
are
on
this
side
of
the
subject
on
the
other
hand
variety
holds
the
secrets
of
charm
vitality
and
the
picturesque
it
is
the
dither
the
play
between
the
larger
parts
that
makes
for
life
and
character
without
variety
there
can
be
no
life
in
any
conception
of
a
perfect
unity
like
the
perfected
life
of
the
buddhist
nirvana
or
nibbana
literally
dying
out
or
extinction
as
of
an
expiring
fire
there
is
no
room
for
variety
for
the
play
of
life
all
such
fretfulness
ceases
to
be
replaced
by
an
calm
beautiful
if
you
like
but
lifeless
there
is
this
deadness
about
any
conception
of
perfection
that
will
always
make
it
an
unattainable
ideal
in
life
those
who
like
the
indian
fakir
or
the
hermits
of
the
middle
ages
have
staked
their
all
on
this
ideal
of
perfection
have
found
it
necessary
to
suppress
life
in
every
way
possible
the
fakirs
often
remaining
motionless
for
long
periods
at
a
time
and
one
of
the
mediaeval
saints
going
so
far
as
to
live
on
the
top
of
a
high
column
where
life
and
movement
were
impossible
and
in
art
it
is
the
same
all
those
who
have
aimed
at
an
absolute
perfection
have
usually
ended
in
a
deadness
the
greeks
knew
better
than
many
of
their
imitators
this
vital
necessity
in
art
in
their
most
ideal
work
there
is
always
that
variety
that
gives
character
and
life
no
formula
or
canon
of
proportions
or
other
mechanical
device
for
the
attainment
of
perfection
was
allowed
by
this
vital
people
entirely
to
subdue
their
love
of
life
and
variety
and
however
near
they
might
go
towards
a
perfect
type
in
their
ideal
heads
and
figures
they
never
went
so
far
as
to
kill
the
individual
in
the
type
it
is
the
lack
of
this
subtle
distinction
that
i
think
has
been
the
cause
of
the
failure
of
so
much
art
founded
on
greek
ideals
much
roman
sculpture
if
you
except
their
portrait
busts
illustrates
this
compared
with
greek
work
it
lacks
that
subtle
variety
in
the
modelling
that
gives
vitality
the
difference
can
be
felt
instinctively
in
the
merest
fragment
of
a
broken
figure
it
is
not
difficult
to
tell
greek
from
roman
fragments
they
pulsate
with
a
life
that
it
is
impossible
to
describe
but
that
one
instinctively
feels
and
this
vitality
depends
i
think
it
will
be
found
on
the
greater
amount
of
variety
in
the
surfaces
of
the
modelling
in
their
architectural
mouldings
the
difference
of
which
we
are
speaking
can
be
more
easily
traced
the
vivacity
and
brilliancy
of
a
greek
moulding
makes
a
roman
work
look
heavy
and
dull
and
it
will
generally
be
found
that
the
romans
used
the
curve
of
the
circle
in
the
sections
of
their
mouldings
a
curve
possessing
the
least
amount
of
variety
as
is
explained
later
where
the
greeks
used
the
lines
of
conic
sections
curves
possessed
of
the
greatest
amount
of
variety
but
while
unity
must
never
exist
without
this
variety
variety
must
always
be
under
the
moral
control
of
unity
or
it
will
get
out
of
hand
and
become
extravagant
in
fact
the
most
perfect
work
like
the
most
perfect
engine
of
which
we
spoke
in
a
former
chapter
has
the
least
amount
of
variety
as
the
engine
has
the
least
amount
of
dither
that
is
compatible
with
life
one
does
not
hear
so
much
talk
in
these
days
about
a
perfect
type
as
was
the
fashion
at
one
time
and
certainly
the
pursuit
of
this
ideal
by
a
process
of
selecting
the
best
features
from
many
models
and
constructing
a
figure
out
of
them
as
an
ideal
type
was
productive
of
very
dead
and
lifeless
work
no
account
was
taken
of
the
variety
from
a
common
type
necessary
in
the
most
perfect
work
if
life
and
individual
interest
are
not
to
be
lost
and
the
thing
is
not
to
become
a
dead
abstraction
but
the
danger
is
rather
the
other
way
at
the
moment
artists
revel
in
the
oddest
of
individual
forms
and
the
type
idea
is
flouted
on
all
hands
an
anarchy
of
individualism
is
upon
us
and
the
vitality
of
disordered
variety
is
more
fashionable
than
the
calm
beauty
of
an
ordered
unity
excess
of
variations
from
a
common
type
is
what
i
think
we
recognise
as
ugliness
in
the
objective
world
whereas
beauty
is
on
the
side
of
unity
and
conformity
to
type
beauty
possesses
both
variety
and
unity
and
is
never
extreme
erring
rather
on
the
side
of
unity
burke
in
his
essay
on
the
sublime
and
the
beautiful
would
seem
to
use
the
word
beautiful
where
we
should
use
the
word
pretty
placing
it
at
the
opposite
pole
from
the
sublime
whereas
i
think
beauty
always
has
some
elements
of
the
sublime
in
it
while
the
merely
pretty
has
not
mere
prettiness
is
a
little
difficult
to
place
it
does
not
come
between
either
of
our
extremes
possessing
little
character
or
type
variety
or
unity
it
is
perhaps
charm
without
either
of
these
strengthening
associates
and
in
consequence
is
always
feeble
and
the
favourite
diet
of
weak
artistic
digestions
the
sculpture
of
ancient
egypt
is
an
instance
of
great
unity
in
conception
and
the
suppression
of
variety
to
a
point
at
which
life
scarcely
exists
the
lines
of
the
egyptian
figures
are
simple
and
long
the
surfaces
smooth
and
unvaried
no
action
is
allowed
to
give
variety
to
the
pose
the
placing
of
one
foot
a
little
in
front
of
the
other
being
alone
permitted
in
the
standing
figures
the
arms
when
not
hanging
straight
down
the
sides
are
flexed
stiffly
at
the
elbow
at
right
angles
the
heads
stare
straight
before
them
the
expression
of
sublimity
is
complete
and
this
was
of
course
what
was
aimed
at
but
how
cold
and
terrible
is
the
lack
of
that
play
and
variety
that
alone
show
life
what
a
relief
it
is
at
the
british
museum
to
go
into
the
elgin
marble
room
and
be
warmed
by
the
noble
life
pulsating
in
the
greek
work
after
visiting
the
cold
egyptian
rooms
in
what
we
call
a
perfect
face
it
is
not
so
much
the
perfect
regularity
of
shape
and
balance
in
the
features
that
charms
us
not
the
things
that
belong
to
an
ideal
type
but
rather
the
subtle
variations
from
this
type
that
are
individual
to
the
particular
head
we
are
admiring
a
perfect
type
of
head
if
such
could
exist
might
excite
our
wonder
but
would
leave
us
cold
but
it
can
never
exist
in
life
the
slightest
movement
of
the
features
which
must
always
accompany
life
and
expression
will
mar
it
and
the
influence
of
these
habitual
movements
on
the
form
of
the
features
themselves
will
invariably
mould
them
into
individual
shapes
away
from
the
perfect
type
whatever
may
have
been
nature
intention
in
the
first
instance
if
we
call
these
variations
from
a
common
type
in
the
features
imperfections
as
it
is
usual
to
do
it
would
seem
to
be
the
imperfections
of
perfection
that
charm
and
stir
us
and
that
perfection
without
these
imperfections
is
a
cold
dead
abstraction
devoid
of
life
that
unity
without
variety
is
lifeless
and
incapable
of
touching
us
on
the
other
hand
variety
without
unity
to
govern
it
is
a
riotous
exuberance
of
life
lacking
all
power
and
restraint
and
wasting
itself
in
a
madness
of
excess
so
that
in
art
a
balance
has
to
be
struck
between
these
two
opposing
qualities
in
good
work
unity
is
the
dominating
quality
all
the
variety
being
done
in
conformity
to
some
large
idea
of
the
whole
which
is
never
lost
sight
of
even
in
the
smallest
detail
of
the
work
good
style
in
art
has
been
defined
as
variety
in
unity
and
hogarth
definition
of
composition
as
the
art
of
varying
well
is
similar
and
i
am
not
sure
that
contrasts
in
harmony
would
not
be
a
suggestive
definition
of
good
colour
let
us
consider
first
variety
and
unity
as
they
are
related
to
line
drawing
and
afterwards
to
mass
drawing
xi
rhythm
variety
of
line
line
rhythm
or
music
depends
on
the
shape
of
your
lines
their
relation
to
each
other
and
their
relation
to
the
boundaries
of
your
panel
in
all
good
work
this
music
of
line
is
in
harmony
with
the
subject
the
artistic
intention
of
your
picture
or
drawing
the
two
lines
with
the
least
variation
are
a
perfectly
straight
line
and
a
circle
a
perfectly
straight
line
has
obviously
no
variety
at
all
while
a
circle
by
curving
at
exactly
the
same
ratio
all
along
has
no
variation
of
curvature
it
is
of
all
curves
the
one
with
the
least
possible
variety
these
two
lines
are
therefore
two
of
the
dullest
and
are
seldom
used
in
pictures
except
to
enhance
the
beauty
and
variety
of
others
and
even
then
subtle
variations
some
amount
of
play
is
introduced
to
relieve
their
baldness
but
used
in
this
way
vertical
and
horizontal
lines
are
of
the
utmost
value
in
rectangular
pictures
uniting
the
composition
to
its
bounding
lines
by
their
parallel
relationship
with
them
and
further
as
a
contrast
to
the
richness
and
beauty
of
curves
they
are
of
great
value
and
are
constantly
used
for
this
purpose
the
group
of
mouldings
cutting
against
the
head
in
a
portrait
or
the
lines
of
a
column
used
to
accentuate
the
curved
forms
of
a
face
or
figure
are
instances
and
the
portrait
painter
is
always
on
the
look
out
for
an
object
in
his
background
that
will
give
him
such
straight
lines
you
may
notice
too
how
the
lines
drawn
across
a
study
in
order
to
copy
it
squaring
it
out
as
it
is
called
improve
the
look
of
a
drawing
giving
a
greater
beauty
to
the
variety
of
the
curves
by
contrast
with
the
variety
lacking
in
straight
lines
the
perfect
curve
of
the
circle
should
always
be
avoided
in
the
drawing
of
natural
objects
even
a
full
moon
and
in
vital
drawings
of
any
sort
some
variety
should
always
be
looked
for
neither
should
the
modelling
of
the
sphere
ever
occur
in
your
work
the
dullest
of
all
curved
surfaces
although
the
curve
of
the
perfect
circle
is
dull
from
its
lack
of
variety
it
is
not
without
beauty
and
this
is
due
to
its
perfect
unity
it
is
of
all
curves
the
most
perfect
example
of
static
unity
without
the
excitement
of
the
slightest
variation
it
goes
on
and
on
for
ever
this
is
no
doubt
the
reason
why
it
was
early
chosen
as
a
symbol
of
eternity
and
certainly
no
more
perfect
symbol
could
be
found
the
circle
seen
in
perspective
assumes
the
more
beautiful
curve
of
the
ellipse
a
curve
having
much
variety
but
as
its
four
quarters
are
alike
not
so
much
as
a
symmetrical
figure
can
have
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
symmetrically
curved
figure
of
all
is
the
egg
of
the
moulding
from
such
a
temple
as
the
erechtheum
called
the
egg
and
dart
moulding
here
we
have
a
perfect
balance
between
variety
and
unity
the
curvature
is
varied
to
an
infinite
degree
at
no
point
is
its
curving
at
the
same
ratio
as
at
any
other
point
perhaps
the
maximum
amount
of
variety
that
can
be
got
in
a
symmetrical
figure
preserving
as
it
does
its
almost
perfect
continuity
for
it
approaches
the
circle
in
the
even
flow
of
its
curvature
this
is
roughly
the
line
of
the
contour
of
a
face
and
you
may
note
how
much
painters
who
have
excelled
in
grace
have
insisted
on
it
in
their
portraits
gainsborough
and
vandyke
are
striking
instances

the
line
of

is
often
one
of
great
beauty
only
here
the

is
apt
to
overbalance
the
unity

of

the
most
beautiful

are
usually
those
in
which

is
subordinated
to
the
unity
of
the

i
fancy
the
greeks
felt
this
when
they
did
away
with
the
hollow
above
the
nose
making
the
line
of
the
forehead
run
with
but
little
interruption
to
the
tip
of
the
nose
the
unity
of
line
is
increased
and
the
variety
made
more
interesting
the
idea
that
this
was
the
common
greek
type
is
i
should
imagine
untrue
for
their

occur

this

the
thing
to
feel
if

would
express

this

variety

roughly
speaking
the

each

has
variety
in
itself
but
there
is
usually
variety

supposing
there

on

one
side
you
will
often
have
a
concave
form
on

always
look
out
for
this

limbs

it
will
often
improve
a
poorly
drawn

is
discovered

you
may
say
is
symmetrical

such

but
there
may
come
a
time
when
things
come
and
it
is
then
that
it
is
useful
to
know
where
to
look
for
possible
weak
spots
in
your
work
sidenote
variety
of
thickness
and
accent
a
line
of
equal
thickness
is
a
very
dead
and
inexpressive
thing
compared
with
one
varied
and
stressed
at
certain
points
if
you
observe
any
of
the
boundaries
in
nature
we
use
a
line
to
express
you
will
notice
some
points
are
accentuated
attract
the
attention
more
than
others
the
only
means
you
have
to
express
this
in
a
line
drawing
is
by
darkening
and
sharpening
the
line
at
other
points
where
the
contour
is
almost
lost
the
line
can
be
soft
and
blurred
it
is
impossible
to
write
of
the
infinite
qualities
of
variety
that
a
fine
draughtsman
will
get
into
his
line
work
they
must
be
studied
first
hand

on
this
play
of
thickness

much
of
the
vitality

depend

unity

is

as
it

a

design
come
under

consideration
including
as
it
does
the
relation
of
the
parts
to
the
whole
its
proper
consideration
would
take
us
into
the
whole
field
of
composition
a
subject
needing
far
more
consideration
than
it
can
be
given
in
this
book
in
almost
all
compositions
a
rhythmic
flow
of
lines
can
be
traced
not
necessarily
a
flow
of
actual
lines
although
these
often
exist
they
may
be
only
imaginary
lines
linking
up
or
massing
certain
parts
and
bringing
them
into
conformity
with
the
rhythmic
conception
of
the
whole
or
again
only
a
certain
stress
and
flow
in
the
forms
suggesting
line
movements
but
these
line
movements
flowing
through
your
panel
are
of
the
utmost
importance
they
are
like
the
melodies
and
subjects
of
a
musical
symphony
weaving
through
and
linking
up
the
whole
composition
often
the
line
of
a
contour
at
one
part
of
a
picture
is
picked
up
again
by
the
contour
of
some
object
at
another
part
of
the
composition
and
although
no
actual
line
connects
them
a
unity
is
thus
set
up
between
them
see
diagrams
pages
and
illustrating
line
compositions
of
pictures
by
botticelli
and
paolo
veronese
this
imaginary
following
through
of
contours
across
spaces
in
a
composition
should
always
be
looked
out
for
and
sought
after
as
nothing
serves
to
unite
a
picture
like
this
relationship
of
remote
parts
the
flow
of
these
lines
will
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
subject
they
will
be
more
gracious
and
easy
or
more
vigorous
and
powerful
according
to
the
demands
of
your
subject
this
linking
up
of
the
contours
applies
equally
well
to
the
drawing
of
a
single
figure
or
even
a
head
or
hand
and
the
student
should
always
be
on
the
look
out
for
this
uniting
quality
it
is
a
quality
of
great
importance
in
giving
unity
to
a
composition
sidenote
parallelism
when
groups
of
lines
in
a
picture
occur
parallel
to
each
other
they
produce
an
accentuation
of
the
particular
quality
the
line
may
contain
a
sort
of
sustained
effect
like
a
sustained
chord
on
an
organ
the
effect
of
which
is
much
bigger
than
that
of
the
same
chord
struck
staccato
this
sustained
quality
has
a
wonderful
influence
in
steadying
and
uniting
your
work
this
parallelism
can
only
be
used
successfully
with
the
simplest
lines
such
as
a
straight
line
or
a
simple
curve
it
is
never
advisable
except
in
decorative
patterns
to
be
used
with
complicated
shapes

the

in

two
angels
with
the
scroll
at

corner
behind
these
two
figures
you
again
have
its
use
accentuating
by
repetition
the
peaceful
line
of
the
hacks
of
the
sheep
the
same
thing
can
be
seen
in
plate

b
where
the
parallelism
of
the
back
lines
of
the
sheep

the
legs

peace

emphasis
that

gives

how

lord
blessed
the
latter
end
of

more
than
the
beginning
note
how
the
greater
completeness
with
which
the
parallelism
has
been
carried
out
has
given
a
much
greater
emphasis
to
the
effect
expressing
a
greater
exaltation

some
rude
things
were
said
above
about
the
straight
line
and
the
circle
on
account
of
their
lack
of
variety
and
it
is
true
that
a
mathematically
straight
line
or
a
mathematically
perfect
circle
are
never
found
in
good
artistic
drawing
for
without
variety
is
no
charm
or
life
but
these
lines
possess
other
qualities
due
to
their
maximum
amount
of
unity
that
give
them
great
power
in
a
composition
and
where
the
expression
of
sublimity
or
any
of
the
deeper
and
more
profound
sentiments
are
in
evidence
they
are
often
to
be
found
the
rows
of
columns
in
a
greek
temple
the
clusters
of
vertical
lines
in
a
gothic
cathedral
interior
are
instances
of
the
sublimity
and
power
they
possess
the
necessary
play
that
makes
for
vitality
the
dither
as
we
called
this
quality
in
a
former
chapter
is
given
in
the
case
of
the
greek
temple
by
the
subtle
curving
of
the
lines
of
columns
and
steps
and
by
the
rich
variety
of
the
sculpture
and
in
the
case
of
the
gothic
cathedral
by
a
rougher
cutting
of
the
stone
blocks
and
the
variety
in
the
colour
of
the
stone
but
generally
speaking
in
gothic
architecture
this
particular
quality
of
dither
or
the
play
of
life
in
all
the
parts
is
conspicuous
the
balance
being
on
the
side
of
variety
rather
than
unity
the
individual
workman
was
given
a
large
amount
of
freedom
and
allowed
to
exercise
his
personal
fancy
the
capitals
of
columns
the
cusping
of
windows
and
the
ornaments
were
seldom
repeated
but
varied
according
to
the
taste
of
the
craftsman
very
high
finish
was
seldom
attempted
the
marks
of
the
chisel
often
being
left
showing
in
the
stonework
all
this
gave
a
warmth
and
exuberance
of
life
to
a
fine
gothic
building
that
makes
a
classical
building
look
cold
by
comparison
the
freedom
with
which
new
parts
were
built
on
to
a
gothic
building
is
another
proof
of
the
fact
that
it
is
not
in
the
conception
of
the
unity
of
the
whole
that
their
chief
charm
consists
on
the
other
hand
a
fine
classic
building
is
the
result
of
one
large
conception
to
which
every
part
has
rigorously
to
conform
any
addition
to
this
in
after
years
is
usually
disastrous
a
high
finish
is
always
attempted
no
tool
marks
nor
any
individuality
of
the
craftsman
is
allowed
to
mar
the
perfect
symmetry
of
the
whole
it
may
be
colder
but
how
perfect
in
sublimity
the
balance
here
is
on
the
side
of
unity
rather
than
variety
the
strength
and
sublimity
of
norman
architecture
is
due
to
the
use
of
circular
curves
in
the
arches
combined
with
straight
lines
and
the
use
of
square
forms
in
the
ornaments
lines
possessed
of
least
variety
all
objects
with
which
one
associates
the
look
of
strength
will
be
found
to
have
straight
lines
in
their
composition
the
look
of
strength
in
a
strong
man
is
due
to
the
square
lines
of
the
contours
so
different
from
the
rounded
forms
of
a
fat
man
and
everyone
knows
the
look
of
mental
power
a
square
forehead
gives
to
a
head
and
the
look
of
physical
power
expressed
by
a
square
jaw
the
look
of
power
in
a
rocky
landscape
or
range
of
hills
is
due
to
the
same
cause

the

their
relation

he

trees
gothic
cathedrals
generally
depend
much
on
this
vertical
feeling
of
line
for
their
impressiveness
the
romans
knew
the
expressive
power
of
the
vertical
when
they
set
up
a
lonely
column
as
a
monument
to
some
great
deed
or
person
and
a
sense
of
this
sublimity
may
be
an
unconscious
explanation
of
the
craze
for
putting

by

this
is
entirely

call

it

not
yet
enough
to
destroy
the
impression
the
line
suggesting
a

is
vertical
and
so
plays
up
to
the

calm
feeling
as
the
horizontal

the

the

they

only

the

place

an
idea
that
occurred
to
me
as
to
the
reason
for
the
somewhat
aggressive
standing
leg
of
the
female
figure
with
the
cymbals
leading
the
procession
of
revellers
i
will
not
attempt
any
analysis
of
this
composition
which
is
ably
gone
into
in
another
book
of
this
series
but
the
standing
leg
of
this
figure
given
such
prominence
in
the
composition
has
always
rather
puzzled
me
i
knew
titian
would
not
have
given
it
that
vigorous
stand
without
a
good
reason
it
certainly
does
not
help
the
run
of
the
composition
although
it
may
be
useful
in
steadying
it
and
it
is
not
a
particularly
beautiful
thing
in
itself
as
the
position
is
one
better
suited
to
a
man
leg
than
to
a
woman
but
if
you
cover
it
over
with
your
finger
and
look
at
the
composition
without
it
i
think
the
reason
of
its
prominence
becomes
plainer
titian
evidently
had
some
trouble
as
well
he
might
have
with
the
forward
leg
of
the
bacchus
he
wished
to
give
the
look
of
his
stepping
from
the
car
lightly
treading
the
air
as
gods
may
be
permitted
to
do
but
the
wheel
of
the
car
that
comes
behind
the
foot
made
it
difficult
to
evade
the
idea
that
he
was
stepping
on
it
which
would
be
the
way
an
ordinary
mortal
would
alight
i
think
the
duty
of
the
aggressive
standing
leg
of
the
leading
bacchante
with
its
great
look
of
weight
is
to
give
a
look
of
lightness
to
this
forward
leg
of
bacchus
by
contrast
which
it
certainly
does
on
examining
the
picture
closely
in
a
good
light
you
will
see
that
he
has
had
the
foot
of
bacchus
in
several
positions
before
he
got
it
right
another
foot
can
distinctly
be
seen
about
a
couple
of
inches
or
so
above
the
present
one
the
general
vertical
direction
of
this
leg
is
also
against
its
look
of
lightness
and
motion
tending
rather
to
give
it
a
stationary
static
look
i
could
not
at
first
see
why
he
did
not
bring
the
foot
further
to
the
right
which
would
have
aided
the
lightness
of
the
figure
and
increased
its
movement
but
you
will
observe
that
this
would
have
hurled
the
whole
weight
of
the
mass
of
figures
on
the
right
forward
on
to
the
single
figure
of
ariadne
and
upset
the
balance
as
you
can
see
by
covering
this
leg
with
your
finger
and
imagining
it
swinging
to
the
right
so
that
titian
having
to
retain
the
vertical
position
for
bacchus

used
the
aggressive

in
this
noble
composition
in
the
writer
opinion
one
of
the
most
sublime
expressions
produced
by
art
the
irresistible
power
and
majesty
of
the
slowly
advancing
figure
of
death
is
largely
due
to
the
right
angle
felt
through
the
pose
not
getting
it
in
the
contour
watts
has
boldly
introduced
it
by
means
of
shading
the
farther
arm
and
insisting
on
the
light
upper
edge
of
the
outstretched
arm
and
hand
while
losing
somewhat
the
outline
of
the
head
beyond
note
also
the
look
of
power
the
insistence
on
square
forms
in
the
drapery
gives
this
figure
the
expression
is
still
further
emphasised
by
the
hard
square
forms
of
the
steps
and
particularly
by
the
strong
horizontal
line
of
the
first
step
so
insisted
on
at
right
angles
to
the
vertical
stand
of
the
figure
and
also
the
upright
lines
of
the
doorway
above
in
contrast
with
the
awful
sublimity
of
this
figure
of
death
how
touching
is
the
expression
of
the
little
figure
of
love
trying
vainly
to
stop
the
inevitable
advance
and
this
expression
is
due
to
the
curved
lines
on
which
the
action
of
the
figure
is
hung
and
the
soft
undulating
forms
of
its
modelling
whereas
the
figure
of
death
is
all
square
lines
and
flat
crisp
planes
the
whole
hanging
on
a
dramatic
right
angle
this
figure
is
all
subtle
fullness
both
of
contour
and
modelling
melting
one
into
the
other
the
whole
hung
upon
a
rich
full
curve
starting
at
the
standing
foot
of
the
advancing
figure
and
whereas
the
expression
of
death
is
supported
and
emphasised
by
the
hard
square
forms
and
texture
of
the
stone
steps
the
expression
of
love
is
supported
and
emphasised
by
the
rounded
forms
and
soft
texture
of
the
clustering
roses
on
this
contrast
of

and

in

with

by

a
noble
composition
founded
on
the

the
figure
of

in
contrast
with
the
curved
lines
in

see

opposite
in
the
diagram
accompanying
the
reproduction
of
this

i
have
tried
to
indicate
in
diagrammatical
form
some
of
the
chief
lines
of
its
anatomy
in
these
diagrams
of
the
anatomy
of
compositions
the
lines
selected
are
not
always
very
obvious
in
the
originals
and
are
justly
much
broken
into
by
truths
of
natural
appearance
but
an
emotional
significance
depending
on
some
arrangement
of
abstract
lines
is
to
be
found
underlying
the
expression
in
every
good
picture
carefully
hidden
as
it
is
by
all
great
artists
and
although
some
apology
is
perhaps
necessary
for
the
ugliness
of
these
diagrams
it
is
an
ugliness
that
attends
all
anatomy
drawings
if
the
student
will
trace
them
and
put
his
tracing
over
the
reproductions
of
the
originals
they
will
help
him
to
see
on
what
things
in
the
arrangement
the
rhythmic
force
of
the
picture
depends
other
lines
as
important
as
those
selected
may
have
been
overlooked
but
the
ones
chosen
will
suffice
to
show
the
general
character
of
them
all
there
is
one
condition
in
a
composition
that
is
laid
down
before
you
begin
and
that
is
the
shape
of
your
panel
or
canvas
this
is
usually
a
rectangular
form
and
all
the
lines
of
your
design
will
have
to
be
considered
in
relation
to
this
shape
vertical
and
horizontal
lines
being
parallel
to
the
boundaries
of
rectangular
pictures
are
always
right
and
immediately
set
up
a
relationship
as
we
have
seen
the
arresting
power
of
the
right
angle
exists
at
each
corner
of
a
rectangular
picture
where
the
vertical
sides
meet
the
horizontal
base
and
this
presents
a
difficulty
because
you
do
not
wish
the
attention
drawn
to
the
corners
and
this
dramatic
combination
of
lines
always
attracts
the
eye
a
favourite
way
of
getting
rid
of
this
is
to
fill
them
with
some
dark
mass
or
with
lines
swinging
round
and
carrying
the
eye
past
them
so
that
the
attention
is
continually
swung
to
the
centre
of
the
picture
for
lines
have
a
power
of
directing
the
attention
the
eye
instinctively
running
with
them
and
this
power
is
of
the
greatest
service
in
directing
the
spectator
to
the
principal
interest
it
is
this
trouble
with
the
corners
that
makes
the
problem
of
filling
a
square
so
exacting
in
an
ordinary
rectangular
panel
you
have
a
certain
amount
of
free
space
in
the
middle
and
the
difficulty
of
filling
the
corners
comfortably
does
not
present
itself
until
this
space
is
arranged
for
but
in
a
square
the
moment
you
leave
the
centre
you
are
in
one
or
other
of
the
corners
and
the
filling
of
them
governs
the
problem
much
more
than
in
the
case
of
other
shapes
it
is
a
good
exercise
for
students
to
give
themselves
a
square
to
fill
in
order
to
understand
this
difficulty
and
learn
to
overcome
it
other
lines
that
possess
a
direct
relation
to
a
rectangular
shape
are
the
diagonals
many
compositions
that
do
not
hang
on
a
vertical
or
horizontal
basis
are
built
on
this
line
and
are
thus
related
to

when
vertical
horizontal
or
diagonal
lines
are
referred
to
it
must
not
be
assumed
that
one
means
in
all
cases
naked
lines
there
is
no
pure
vertical
line
in
a
stone
pine
or
cypress
tree
nor
pure
horizontal
line
in
a
stretch
of
country
but
the
whole
swing
of
their
lines
is
vertical
or
horizontal
and
in
the
same
way
when
one
speaks
of
a
composition
being
hung
upon
a
diagonal
it
is
seldom
that
a
naked
diagonal
line
exists
in
the
composition
but
the
general
swing
is
across
the
panel
in
harmony
with
one
or
other
diagonal
and
when
this
is
so
there
is
a
unity
set
up
between
the
design
and
its
boundaries
a
good
instance
of
vertical
horizontal
and
diagonal
lines
to
unite
a
picture
is

velazquez
has
gone
out
of
his
way
to
get
this
line
as
it
could
hardly
have
been
the
fashion
to
carry
a
gun
in
this
position
pointing
straight
at
the

the
man
behind

lines

occur
in
the
sky

one
running
right
through
the
group
of
spears
the
use
of
the
diagonal
is
another
remarkable
thing
in
the
lines
of
this
picture
if
you
place
a
ruler
on
the
slanting
line
of
the
flag
behind
the
horse
head
to
the
right
you
find
it
is
exactly
parallel
to
a
diagonal
drawn
from
the
top
corner
to
the
lower
corner
another
line
practically
parallel
to
this
diagonal
is
the
line
of
the
sword
belonging
to
the
figure
offering
the
key
the
feeling
of
which
is
continued
in
the
hand
and
key
of
this
same
figure
it
may
be
noted
also
that
the
back
right
leg
of
the
horse
in
the
front
is
parallel
to
the
other
diagonal
the
under
side
of
it
being
actually
on
the
diagonal
and
thus
brought
into
relation
with
the
bounding
lines
of
the
picture
and
all
these
lines
without
the
artifice
being
too
apparent
give
that
dignified
look
so
in
harmony
with
the
nature
of
the
subject

without

steadying
power
of

get
out
of
hand
and
lose
their
power
in
architecture
the
rococo
style
is
an
example
of
this
excess
while
all
expressions
of
exuberant
life
and
energy
of
charm
and
grace
depend
on
curved
lines
for
their
effect
yet
in
their
most
refined
and
beautiful
expression
they
err
on
the
side
of
the
square
forms
rather
than
the
circle
when
the
uncontrolled
use
of
curves
approaching
the
circle
and
volute
are
indulged
in
unrestrained
by
the
steadying
influence
of
any
straight
lines
the
effect
is
gross
the
finest
curves
are
full
of
restraint
and
excessive
curvature
is
a
thing
to
be
avoided
in
good
drawing
we
recognise
this
integrity
of
straight
lines

we
say
anybody
is
an
upright

is
quite
straight

to
convey
the
impression

who
gloried
in
the
unrestrained
expression
of

zeal
to
live

deeply

much
of
his
work
is
and
wonderful
as
it
all
is
the
excessive
use
of

rounded

in
his
later

robs
it
of
much
of

offends
us

its

look

let
us
take
our
simplest
form
of
composition
again
a
stretch
of
sea

apply

had
straight
lines
you
will
see
how
the

one
of
the
simplest

most
graceful

the

a
continuous

leading

not

so
much
on

it

interesting
to
note
how
much
nearer
to
the

approach
than
do
those

whatever
may
be
said
by
the
academically
minded
as

the
incorrectness

there
can
be
no
two
opinions
as
to
the
remarkable
rhythmic
vitality
of

the
upward

his

the

thrills
one
in
much
the
same
way
as
watching
a
flaring
fire
there
is
something
exalting
and
stimulating
in
it
although
used
to
excess
as
he
sometimes
uses
it
it
is
apt
to
suffer
from
lack
of
repose
two
examples
of
his
pictures
are
reproduced
here
and
illustrate
his
use
of
this
form
of
movement
in
the
lines

masses
of
his
compositions
nowhere
does
he
let
the
eye
rest
but
keeps
the
same
flickering
movement
going
throughout
all
his
masses
and
edges
the
extraordinary
thing
about
this
remarkable
painter
is
that
while
this
restless
unrestrained
form
of
composition
makes
his
work
akin
to
the
rococo
work
of
a
later
period
there
is
a
fiery
earnestness
and
sincerity
in
all
he
does
only
to
be
matched
among
the
primitive
painters
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
and
very
different
from
the
false
sentiment
of
the
later
school
blake
was
also
fond
of
this
flame
line

usually
used
it
in
combination
with
more
straight
lines
than
the
energetic
spaniard
allowed
himself
plates
iii
and
v
in
the
job
series
are
good
examples
of
his
use
of
this
form
in
both
cases
it
will
be
seen
that
he
uses
it
in
combination
with
the
steadying
influence
of
straight
lines
which
help
to
keep
the
balance
and
repose
necessary
in
the
treatment
of
even
the
most
violent
subjects
in
art
a
continual
interruption
in
the
flow
of
lines
and
a
harsh
jarring
of
one
against
another
in
an
angular
jagged
fashion
produces
a
feeling

two
of
them
are
straight
and
at
right
angles
the
longer
being
across
of
the

the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
trick
the
eye
out
of
knowing
that
this
line
is
in
the
centre
by
drawing
others
parallel
to
it
leading
the
eye
downwards
to
line
which
is
now
much
more
important
than
and
in
better
proportion
with
the
height
of
the
panel
the
vertical
line
is
rather
stark
and
lonely
and
so
we
introduce
two
more
verticals
at
and
which
modify
this
and
with
another
two
lines
in
sympathy
with
and
leading
the
eye
back
to
the
horizontal
top
of
the
panel
some
sort
of
unity
is
set
up
the
introduction
of
some
masses
completing
the
scheme
at
there
is
a
quality
of
sympathy
set
up
by
certain
line
relationships
about
which
it
is
important
to
say
something
ladies
who
have
the
instinct
for
choosing
a
hat
or
doing
their
hair
to
suit
their
face
instinctively
know
something
of
this
know
that
certain
things
in
their
face
are
emphasised
by
certain
forms
in
their
hats
or
hair
and
the
care
that
has
to
be
taken
to
see
that
the
things
thus
drawn
attention
to
are
their
best
and
not
their
worst
points
the
principle
is
more
generally
understood
in
relation
to
colour
everybody
knows
how
the
blueness
of
blue
eyes
is
emphasised
by
a
sympathetic
blue
dress
or
touch
of
blue
on
a
hat
but
the
same
principle
applies
to
lines
the
qualities
of
line
in
beautiful
eyes
and
eyebrows
are
emphasised
by
the
long
sympathetic
curve
of
a
picture
hat
and
the
becoming
effect
of
a
necklace
is
partly
due
to
the
same
cause
the
lines
being
in
sympathy
with
the
eyes
or
the
oval
of
the
face
according
to
how
low
or
high
they
hang
the
influence
of
long
lines
is
thus
to
pick
out
from
among
the
lines
of
a
face
those
with
which
they
are
in
sympathy
and
thus
to
accentuate
them

the
two
things
that

out

in

are
the
beauty
of
the
eyes

the
shape
of
the

instead
of
the

you
have
the

the
widening
circles

which
swing
round
in
sympathy
with
the
eyes
and
concentrate
the
attention
on
them
that
on
the
left
looking
at
the
picture
being
nearest
the
centre
has
the
greatest
attention
concentrated
upon
it
the
lines
of
the
mirror
being
more
in
sympathy
with
this
than
the
other
eye
as
it
is
nearer
the
centre
if
you
care
to
take
the
trouble
cut
a
hole
in
a
piece
of
opaque
paper
the
size
of
the
head
and
placing
it
over
the
illustration
look
at
the
face
without
the
influence
of
these
outside
lines
and
note
how
much
more
equally
divided
the
attention
is
between
the
two
eyes
without
the
emphasis
given
to
the
one
by
the
mirror
this
helps
the
unity
of
impression
which
with
both
eyes
realised
to
so
intense
a
focus
might
have
suffered
this
mirror
forms
a
sort
of
echo
of
the
pupil
of
the
eye

its

form
in
order
to
try
and
show
that
the
musical
quality
of
lines
and
the
emotions
they
are
capable
of
calling
up
are
not
dependent
upon
truth
to
natural
forms
but
are
inherent
in
abstract
arrangements
themselves
that
is
to
say
whenever
you
get
certain
arrangements
of
lines
no
matter
what
the
objects
in
nature
may
be
that
yield
them
you
will
always
get
the
particular
emotional
stimulus
belonging
to
such
arrangements
for
instance
whenever
you
get
long
uninterrupted
horizontal
lines
running
through
a
picture
not
opposed
by
any
violent
contrast
you
will
always
get
an
impression
of
intense
quiet
and
repose
no
matter
whether
the
natural
objects
yielding
these
lines
are
a
wide
stretch
of
country
with
long
horizontal
clouds
in
the
sky
a
pool
with
a
gentle
breeze
making
horizontal
bars
on
its
surface
or
a
pile
of
wood
in
a
timber
yard
and
whenever
you
get
long
vertical
lines
in
a
composition
no
matter
whether
it
be
a
cathedral
interior
a
pine
forest
or
a
row
of
scaffold
poles
you
will
always
have
the
particular
feeling
associated
with
rows
of
vertical
lines
in
the
abstract
and
further
whenever
you
get
the
swinging
lines
of
the
volute
an
impression
of
energy
will
be
conveyed
no
matter
whether
it
be
a
breaking
wave
rolling
clouds
whirling
dust
or
only
a
mass
of
tangled
hoop
iron
in
a
wheelwright
yard
as
was
said
above
these
effects
may
be
greatly
increased
modified
or
even
destroyed
by
associations
connected
with
the
things
represented
if
in
painting
the
timber
yard
the
artist
is
thinking
more
about
making
it
look
like
a
stack
of
real
wood
with
its
commercial
associations
and
less
about
using
the
artistic
material
its
appearance
presents
for
the
making
of
a
picture
he
may
miss
the
harmonic
impression
the
long
lines
of
the
stacks
of
wood
present
if
real
wood
is
the
first
thing
you
are
led
to
think
of
in
looking
at
his
work
he
will
obviously
have
missed
the
expression
of
any
artistic
feeling
the
subject
was
capable
of
producing
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
scaffold
poles
or
the
hoop
iron
in
the
wheelwright
yard
this
structure
of
abstract
lines
at
the
basis
of
a
picture
will
be
more
or
less
overlaid
with
the
truths
of
nature
and
all
the
rich
variety
of
natural
forms
according
to
the
requirements
of
the
subject
thus
in
large
decorative
work
where
the
painting
has
to
take
its
place
as
part
of
an
architectural
scheme
the
severity
of
this
skeleton
will
be
necessary
to
unite
the
work
to
the
architectural
forms
around
it
of
which
it
has
to
form
a
part
and
very
little
indulgence
in
the
realisation
of
natural
truth
should
be
permitted
to
obscure
it
but
in
the
painting
of
a
small
cabinet
picture
that
exists
for
close
inspection
the
supporting
power
of
this
line
basis
is
not
nearly
so
essential
and
a
full
indulgence
in
all
the
rich
variety
of
natural
detail
is
permissible
and
this
is
how
it
happens
that
painters
who
have
gloried
in
rich
details
have
always
painted
small
pictures
and
painters
who
have
preferred
larger
truths
pictures
of
bigger
dimensions
it
sounds
rather
paradoxical
to
say
the
smaller
the
picture
the
more
detail
it
should
contain
and
the
larger
the
less
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
for
although
a
large
picture
has
not
of
necessity
got
to
be
part
of
an
architectural
scheme
it
has
to
be
looked
at
from
a
distance
at
which
small
detail
could
not
be
seen
and
where
such
detail
would
greatly
weaken
its
expressive
power
and
further
the
small
picture
easily
comes
within
the
field
of
vision
and
the
whole
impression
can
be
readily
grasped
without
the
main
lines
being
as
it
were
underlined
but
in
a
big
picture
one
of
the
greatest
difficulties
is
to
get
it
to
read
simply
to
strike
the
eye
as
one
impression
its
size
making
it
difficult
for
it
to
be
got
comfortably
within
the
field
of
vision
every
artifice
has
to
be
used
to
give
it
breadth
of
treatment
as
it
is
called
and
nothing
interferes
with
this
like
detail
xiii
variety
of
mass
the
masses
that
go
to
make
up
a
picture
have
variety
in
their
shape
their
tone
values
their
edges
in
texture
quality
and
in
gradation
quite
a
formidable
list
but
each
of
these
particulars
has
some
rhythmic
quality
of
its
own
about
which
it
will
be
necessary
to
say
a
word
sidenote
variety
of
shape
as
to
variety
of
shape
many
things
that
were
said
about
lines
apply
equally
to
the
spaces
enclosed
by
them
it
is
impossible
to
write
of
the
rhythmic
possibilities
that
the
infinite
variety
of
shapes
possessed
by
natural
objects
contain
except
to
point
out
how
necessary
the
study
of
nature
is
for
this
variety
of
shape
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
things
to
invent
and
one
of
the
commonest
things
in
nature
however
imaginative
your
conception
and
no
matter
how
far
you
may
carry
your
design
working
from
imagination
there
will
come
a
time
when
studies
from
nature
will
be
necessary
if
your
work
is
to
have
the
variety
that
will
give
life
and
interest
try
and
draw
from
imagination
a
row
of
elm
trees
of
about
the
same
height
and
distance
apart
and
get
the
variety
of
nature
into
them
and
you
will
see
how
difficult
it
is
to
invent
on
examining
your
work
you
will
probably
discover
two
or
three
pet
forms
repeated
or
there
may
be
only
one
or
try
and
draw
some
cumulus
clouds
from
imagination
several
groups
of
them
across
a
sky
and
you
will
find
how
often
again
you
have
repeated
unconsciously
the
same
forms
how
tired
one
gets
of
the
pet
cloud
or
tree
of
a
painter
who
does
not
often
consult
nature
in
his
pictures
nature
is
the
great
storehouse
of
variety
even
a
piece
of
coal
will
suggest
more
interesting
than
you
can
invent
and
it
is
fascinating
to
watch
the
infinite
variety
of
graceful
forms
assumed
by
the
curling
smoke
from
a
cigarette
full
of
suggestions
for
beautiful
line
arrangements
if
this
variety
of
form
in
your
work
is
allowed
to
become
excessive
it
will
overpower
the
unity
of
your
conception
it
is
in
the
larger
unity
of
your
composition
that
the
imaginative
faculty
will
be
wanted
and
variety
in
your
forms
should
always
be
subordinated
to
this
idea
nature
does
not
so
readily
suggest
a
scheme
of
unity
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
first
condition
of
your
picture
the
four
bounding
lines
does
not
exist
in
nature
you
may
get
infinite
suggestions
for
arrangements
and
should
always
be
on
the
look
out
for
them
but
your
imagination
will
have
to
relate
them
to
the
rigorous
conditions
of
your
four
bounding
lines
and
nature
does
not
help
you
much
here
but
when
variety
in
the
forms
is
wanted
she
is
and
it
is
never
advisable
to
waste
inventive
power
where
it
is
so
unnecessary
but
although
nature
does
not
readily
suggest
a
design
fitting
the
conditions
of
a
panel
her
tendency
is
always
towards
unity
of
arrangement
if
you
take
a
bunch
of
flowers
or
leaves
and
haphazard
stuff
them
into
a
vase
of
water
you
will
probably
get
a
very
chaotic
arrangement
but
if
you
leave
it
for
some
time
and
let
nature
have
a
chance
you
will
find
that
the
leaves
and
flowers
have
arranged
themselves
much
more
harmoniously
and
if
you
cut
down
one
of
a
group
of
trees
what
a
harsh
discordant
gap
is
usually
left
but
in
time
nature
will
by
throwing
a
bough
here
and
filling
up
a
gap
there
as
far
as
possible
rectify
matters
and
bring
all
into
unity
again
i
am
prepared
to
be
told
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
beauty
but
is
only
the
result
of
nature
attempts
to
seek
for
light
and
air
but
whatever
be
the
physical
cause
the
fact
is
the
same
that
nature
laws
tend
to
pictorial
unity
of
arrangement
sidenote
variety
of
tone
values
it
will
be
as
well
to
try
and
explain
what
is
meant
by
tone
values
all
the
masses
or
tones
for
the
terms
are
often
used
interchangeably
that
go
to
the
making
of
a
visual
impression
can
be
considered
in
relation
to
an
imagined
scale
from
white
to
represent
the
lightest
to
black
to
represent
the
darkest
tones
this
scale
of
values
does
not
refer
to
light
and
shade
only
but
light
and
shade
colour
and
the
whole
visual
impression
are
considered
as
one
mosaic
of
masses
of
different
degrees
of
darkness
or
lightness
a
dark
object
in
strong
light
may
be
lighter
than
a
white
object
in
shadow
or
the
reverse
it
will
depend
on
the
amount
of
reflected
light
colour
only
matters
in
so
far
as
it
affects
the
position
of
the
mass
in
this
imagined
scale
of
black
and
white
the
correct
observation
of
these
tone
values
is
a
most
important
matter
and
one
of
no
little
difficulty
the
word
tone
is
used
in
two
senses
in
the
first
place
when
referring
to
the
individual
masses
as
to
their
relations
in
the
scale
of
tone
values
and
secondly
when
referring
to
the
musical
relationship
of
these
values
to
a
oneness
of
tone
idea
governing
the
whole
impression
in
very
much
the
same
way
you
might
refer
to
a
single
note
in
music
as
a
tone
and
also
to
the
tone
of
the
whole
orchestra
the
word
values
always
refers
to
the
relationship
of
the
individual
masses
or
tones
in
our
imagined
scale
from
black
to
white
we
say
a
picture
is
out
of
value
or
out
of
tone
when
some
of
the
values
are
darker
or
lighter
than
our
sense
of
harmony
feels
they
should
be
in
the
same
way
as
we
should
say
an
instrument
in
an
orchestra
was
out
of
tone
or
tune
when
it
was
higher
or
lower
than
our
sense
of
harmony
allowed
tone
is
so
intimately
associated
with
the
colour
of
a
picture
that
it
is
a
little
difficult
to
treat
of
it
apart
and
it
is
often
used
in
a
sense
to
include
colour
in
speaking
of
the
general
tone
we
say
it
has
a
warm
tone
or
a
cold
tone
there
is
a
particular
rhythmic
beauty
about
a
arrangement
of
tone
values
that
is
a
very
important
part
of
pictorial
design
this
music
of
tone
has
been
present
in
art
in
a
rudimentary
way
since
the
earliest
time
but
has
recently
received
a
much
greater
amount
of
attention
and
much
new
light
on
the
subject
has
been
given
by
the
impressionist
movement
and
the
study
of
the
art
of
china
and
japan
which
is
nearly
always
very
beautiful
in
this
respect
this
quality
of
tone
music
is
most
dominant
when
the
masses
are
large
and
simple
when
the
contemplation
of
them
is
not
disturbed
by
much
variety
and
they
have
little
variation
of
texture
and
gradation
a
slight
mist
will
often
improve
the
tone
of
a
landscape
for
this
reason
it
simplifies
the
tones
masses
them
together
obliterating
many
smaller
varieties
i
have
even
heard
of
the
tone
of
a
picture
being
improved
by
such
a
mist
scrambled
or
glazed
over
it
illustration
plate
xliii
monte
solaro
capri
study
on
brown
paper
in
charcoal
and
white
chalk
the
powder
on
a
lady
face
when
not
is
an
improvement
for
the
same
reason
it
simplifies
the
tones
by
destroying
the
distressing
shining
lights
that
were
cutting
up
the
masses
and
it
also
destroys
a
large
amount
of
half
tone
broadening
the
lights
almost
up
to
the
commencement
of
the
shadows
tone
relationships
are
most
sympathetic
when
the
middle
values
of
your
scale
only
are
used
that
is
to
say
when
the
lights
are
low
in
tone
and
the
darks
they
are
most
dramatic
and
intense
when
the
contrasts
are
great
and
the
jumps
from
dark
to
light
the
sympathetic
charm
of
effects
is
due
largely
to
the
tones
being
of
this
middle
range
only
whereas
the
striking
dramatic
effect
of
a
storm
clearing
in
which
you
may
get
a
landscape
brilliantly
lit
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
sun
seen
against
the
dark
clouds
of
the
retreating
storm
owes
much
of
its
dramatic
quality
to
contrast
the
strong
contrasts
of
tone
values
coupled
with
the
strong
colour
contrast
between
the
warm
sunlit
land
and
the
cold
angry
blue
of
the
storm
gives
such
a
scene
much
dramatic
effect
and
power
the
subject
of
values
will
be
further
treated
in
dealing
with
unity
of
tone
sidenote
variety
in
quality
and
texture
variety
in
quality
and
nature
is
almost
too
subtle
to
write
about
with
any
prospect
of
being
understood
the
play
of
different
qualities
and
textures
in
the
masses
that
go
to
form
a
picture
must
be
appreciated
at
first
hand
and
little
can
be
written
about
it
oil
paint
is
capable
of
almost
unlimited
variety
in
this
way
but
it
is
better
to
leave
the
study
of
such
qualities
until
you
have
mastered
the
medium
in
its
more
simple
aspects
the
particular
tone
music
of
which
we
were
speaking
is
not
helped
by
any
great
use
of
this
variety
a
oneness
of
quality
throughout
the
work
is
best
suited
to
exhibit
it
masters
of
tone
like
whistler
preserve
this
oneness
of
quality
very
carefully
in
their
work
relying
chiefly
on
the
grain
of
a
rough
canvas
to
give
the
necessary
variety
and
prevent
a
deadness
in
the
quality
of
the
tones
but
when
more
force
and
brilliancy
are
wanted
some
use
of
your
paint
in
a
crumbling
broken
manner
is
necessary
as
it
catches
more
light
thus
increasing
the
force
of
the
impression
claude
monet
and
his
followers
in
their
search
for
brilliancy
used
this
quality
throughout
many
of
their
paintings
with
new
and
striking
results
but
it
is
at
the
sacrifice
of
many
beautiful
qualities
of
form
as
this
roughness
of
surface
does
not
lend
itself
readily
to
any
finesse
of
modelling
in
the
case
of
claude
monet
work
however
this
does
not
matter
as
form
with
all
its
subtleties
is
not
a
thing
he
made
any
attempt
at
exploiting
nature
is
sufficiently
vast
for
beautiful
work
to
be
done
in
separate
departments
of
vision
although
one
can
not
place
such
work
on
the
same
plane
with
successful
pictures
of
wider
scope
and
the
particular
visual
beauty
of
sparkling
light
and
atmosphere
of
which
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
make
a
separate
study
could
hardly
exist
in
a
work
that
aimed
also
at
the
significance
of
beautiful
form
the
appeal
of
form
as
was
explained
in
an
earlier
chapter
not
being
entirely
due
to
a
visual
but
to
a
mental
perception
into
which
the
sense
of
touch
enters
by
association
the
scintillation
and
glitter
of
light
destroys
this
touch
idea
which
is
better
preserved
in
quieter
lightings
there
is
another
point
in
connection
with
the
use
of
thick
paint
that
i
do
think
is
sufficiently
well
known
and
that
is
its
greater
readiness
to
be
discoloured
by
the
oil
in
its
composition
coming
to
the
surface
fifteen
years
ago
i
did
what
it
would
be
advisable
for
every
student
to
do
as
soon
as
possible
namely
make
a
chart
of
the
colours
he
is
likely
to
use
get
a
good
white
canvas
and
set
upon
it
in
columns
the
different
colours
very
much
as
you
would
do
on
your
palette
writing
the
names
in
ink
beside
them
then
take
a
an
ivory
one
by
preference
and
drag
it
from
the
individual
masses
of
paint
so
as
to
get
a
gradation
of
different
thicknesses
from
the
thinnest
possible
layer
where
your
knife
ends
to
the
thick
mass
where
it
was
squeezed
out
of
the
tube
it
is
also
advisable
to
have
previously
ruled
some
pencil
lines
with
a
hard
point
down
the
canvas
in
such
a
manner
that
the
strips
of
paint
will
cross
the
lines
this
chart
will
be
of
the
greatest
value
to
you
in
noting
the
effect
of
time
on
paint
to
make
it
more
complete
the
colours
of
several
makers
should
be
put
down
and
at
any
rate
the
whites
of
several
different
makes
should
be
on
it
as
white
enters
so
largely
into
your
painting
it
is
highly
necessary
to
use
one
that
does
not
change
the
two
things
that
i
have
noticed
are
that
the
thin
ends
of
the
strips
of
white
have
invariably
kept
whiter
than
the
thick
end
and
that
all
the
paints
have
become
a
little
more
transparent
with
time
the
pencil
lines
here
come
in
useful
as
they
can
be
seen
through
the
thinner
portion
and
show
to
what
extent
this
transparency
has
occurred
but
the
point
i
wish
to
emphasise
is
that
at
the
thick
end
the
larger
body
of
oil
in
the
paint
which
always
comes
to
the
surface
as
it
dries
has
darkened
and
yellowed
the
surface
greatly
while
the
small
amount
of
oil
at
the
thin
end
has
not
darkened
it
to
any
extent
claude
monet
evidently
knew
this
and
got
over
the
difficulty
by
painting
on
an
absorbent
canvas
which
sucks
the
surplus
oil
out
from
below
and
thus
prevents
its
coming
to
the
surface
and
discolouring
the
work
in
time
when
this
thick
manner
of
painting
is
adopted
an
absorbent
canvas
should
always
be
used
it
also
has
the
advantage
of
giving
a
dull
dry
surface
of
more
brilliancy
than
a
shiny
one
although
not
so
much
as
with
painting
varieties
of
texture
enter
into
drawings
done
with
any
of
the
mediums
that
lend
themselves
to
mass
drawing
charcoal
conté
crayon
lithographic
chalk
and
even
red
chalk
and
lead
pencil
are
capable
of
giving
a
variety
of
textures
governed
largely
by
the
surface
of
the
paper
used
but
this
is
more
the
province
of
painting
than
of
drawing
proper
and
charcoal
which
is
more
painting
than
drawing
is
the
only
medium
in
which
it
can
be
used
with
much
effect
sidenote
variety
of
edges
there
is
a
very
beautiful
rhythmic
quality
in
the
play
from
softness
to
sharpness
on
the
edges
of
masses
a
monotonous
sharpness
of
edge
is
hard
stern
and
unsympathetic
this
is
a
useful
quality
at
times
particularly
in
decorative
work
where
the
more
intimate
sympathetic
qualities
are
not
so
much
wanted
and
where
the
harder
forms
go
better
with
the
architectural
surroundings
of
which
your
painted
decoration
should
form
a
part
on
the
other
hand
a
monotonous
softness
of
edge
is
very
weak
and
and
too
entirely
lacking
in
power
to
be
desirable
if
you
find
any
successful
work
done
with
this
quality
of
edge
unrelieved
by
any
sharpnesses
it
will
depend
on
colour
and
not
form
for
any
qualities
it
may
possess
some
amount
of
softness
makes
for
charm
and
is
extremely
popular
i
do
like
that
because
it
so
nice
and
soft
is
a
regular
remark
in
the
studio
and
is
always
meant
as
a
great
compliment
but
is
seldom
taken
as
such
by
the
suffering
painter
but
a
balance
of
these
two
qualities
playing
about
your
contours
produces
the
most
delightful
results
and
the
artist
is
always
on
the
look
out
for
such
variations
he
seldom
lets
a
sharpness
of
edge
run
far
without
losing
it
occasionally
it
may
be
necessary
for
the
hang
of
the
composition
that
some
leading
edges
should
be
much
insisted
on
but
even
here
a
monotonous
sharpness
is
too
dead
a
thing
and
although
a
firmness
of
run
will
be
allowed
to
be
felt
subtle
variations
will
be
introduced
to
prevent
deadness
the
venetians
from
giorgione
time
were
great
masters
of
this
music
of
edges
the
structure
of
lines
surrounding
the
masses
on
which
their
compositions
are
built
were
fused
in
the
most
mysterious
and
delightful
way
but
although
melting
into
the
surrounding
mass
they
are
always
firm
and
never
soft
and
feeble
study
the
edge
in
such
a
good
example
of
the
venetian
manner
as
the
bacchus
and
ariadne
at
the
national
gallery
and
note
where
they
are
hard
and
where
lost
there
is
one
rather
remarkable
fact
to
be
observed
in
this
picture
and
many
venetian
works
and
this
is
that
the
most
accented
edges
are
reserved
for
unessential
parts
like
the
piece
of
white
drapery
on
the
lower
arm
of
the
girl
with
the
cymbals
and
the
little
white
flower
on
the
boy
head
in
front
the
edges
on
the
flesh
are
everywhere
fused
and
soft
the
draperies
being
much
sharper
you
may
notice
the
same
thing
in
many
pictures
of
the
later
venetian
schools
the
greatest
accents
on
the
edges
are
rarely
in
the
head
except
it
may
be
occasionally
in
the
eyes
but
they
love
to
get
some
feature
such
as
a
shirt
coming
against
the
soft
modelling
of
the
neck
to
balance
the
fused
edges
in
the
flesh
in
the
head
of
philip
iv
in
our
national
gallery
the
only
place
where
velazquez
has
allowed
himself
anything
like
a
sharp
edge
is
in
the
high
lights
on
the
chain
hanging
round
the
neck
the
softer
edges
of
the
principal
features
in
these
compositions
lend
a
largeness
and
mystery
to
these
parts
and
to
restore
the
balance
sharpnesses
are
introduced
in
accessories

the
figure

the

note
the
wonderful
variety
on
the
edges
of
the
white
masses
of
the
coat
and
the
horse
nose
and
also
that
the
sharpest
accents
are
reserved
for
such
as
the
bows
on
the
tunic

the
loose
hair

velazquez
edges
are
wonderful
and
can
not
be
too
carefully
studied
he
worked
largely
in
flat
tones
or
planes
but
this
richness
and
variety
of
his
edges
keeps
his
work
from
looking
flat
and
dull
like
that
of
some
of
his
followers

as
i
could
have
wished
the
process
having
a
tendency
to
sharpen
edges
rather
monotonously
this
quality
is
everywhere
to
be
found
in
nature
if
you
regard
any
scene
pictorially
looking
at
it
as
a
whole
and
not
letting
your
eye
focus
on
individual
objects
wandering
from
one
to
another
while
being
but
dimly
conscious
of
the
whole
but
regarding
it
as
a
beautiful
ensemble
you
will
find
that
the
boundaries
of
the
masses
are
not
hard
continuous
edges
but
play
continually
along
their
course
here
melting
imperceptibly
into
the
surrounding
mass
and
there
accentuated
more
sharply
even
a
long
continuous
line
like
the
horizon
at
sea
has
some
amount
of
this
play
which
you
should
always
be
on
the
look
out
for
but
when
the
parts
only
of
nature
are
regarded
and
each
is
separately
focussed
hard
edges
will
be
found
to
exist
almost
everywhere
unless
there
is
a
positive
mist
enveloping
the
objects
and
this
is
the
usual
way
of
looking
at
things
but
a
picture
that

catalogue
of

focussed

the

quantity

mass

the
reproduction
does
not
unfortunately
show
this
as
well
as
the
original
in
naturalistic
work
the
necessity
for
painting
to
one
focal
impression
is
as
great
as
the
necessity
of
painting
in
true
perspective
what
perspective
has
done
for
drawing
the
impressionist
system
of
painting
to
one
focus
has
done
for
tone
before
perspective
was
introduced
each
individual
object
in
a
picture
was
drawn
with
a
separate
centre
of
vision
fixed
on
each
object
in
turn
what
perspective
did
was
to
insist
that
all
objects
in
a
picture
should
be
drawn
in
relation
to
one
fixed
centre
of
vision
and
whereas
formerly
each
object
was
painted
to
a
hard
focus
whether
it
was
in
the
foreground
or
the
distance
impressionism
teaches
that
you
can
not
have
the
focus
in
a
picture
at
the
same
time
on
the
foreground
and
the
distance
of
course
there
are
many
manners
of
painting
with
more
primitive
conventions
in
which
the
consideration
of
focus
does
not
enter
but
in
all
painting
that
aims
at
reproducing
the
impressions
directly
produced
in
us
by
natural
appearances
this
question
of
focus
and
its
influence
on
the
quality
of
your
edges
is
of
great
importance
something
should
be
said
about
the
serrated
edges
of
masses
like
those
of
trees
seen
against
the
sky
these
are
very
difficult
to
treat
and
almost
every
landscape
painter
has
a
different
formula
the
hard
fussy
photographic
appearance
of
trees
misses
all
their
beauty
and
sublimity
there
are
three
principal
types
of
treatment
that
may
serve
as
examples
in
the
first
place

are
the
trees

the
early
italian
painters

this
treatment
of

is
very
useful
as
a
contrast
to
the

the
treatment
is
more
often
applied
nowadays
to
a

the

rich

focus
he
ignored
individual

them
into

found
more
sharply
against

the
subordinate

these
are
three
of
the
more
extreme
types
of
trees
to
be
met
with
in
art
but
the
variations
on
these
types
are
very
numerous
whatever
treatment
you
adopt
the
tree
must
be
considered
as
a
whole
and
some
rhythmic
form
related
to
this
large
impression
selected
and
this
applies
to
all
forms
with
serrated
edges
some
large
order
must
be
found
to
which
the
fussiness
of
the
edges
must
conform
the
subject
of
edges
generally
is
a
very
important
one
and
one
much
more
worried
over
by
a
master
than
by
the
average
student
it
is
interesting
to
note
how
all
the
great
painters
have
begun
with
a
hard
manner
with
edges
of
little
variety
from
which
they
have
gradually
developed
a
looser
manner
learning
to
master
the
difficulties
of
design
that
hard
contours
insist
on
your
facing
and
only
when
this
is
thoroughly
mastered
letting
themselves
develop
freely
this
play
on
the
edges
this
looser
handling
for
under
the
freest
painting
if
it
be
good
there
will
be
found
a
structure
of
masses
and
lines
they
may
never
be
insisted
on
but
their
steadying
influence
will
always
be
felt
so
err
in
your
student
work
on
the
side
of
hardness
rather
than
looseness
if
you
would
discipline
yourself
to
design
your
work
well
occasionally
only
let
yourself
go
at
a
looser
handling
sidenote
variety
of
gradiation
variety
of
gradation
will
naturally
be
governed
largely
by
the
form
and
light
and
shade
of
the
objects
in
your
composition
but
while
studying
the
gradations
of
tone
that
express
form
and
give
the
modelling
you
should
never
neglect
to
keep
the
mind
fixed
upon
the
relation
the
part
you
are
painting
bears
to
the
whole
picture
and
nothing
should
be
done
that
is
out
of
harmony
with
this
large
conception
it
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
things
to
decide
the
amount
of
variety
and
emphasis
allowable
for
the
smaller
parts
of
a
picture
so
as
to
bring
all
in
harmony
with
that
oneness
of
impression
that
should
dominate
the
whole
how
much
of
your
scale
of
values
it
is
permissible
to
use
for
the
modelling
of
each
individual
part
in
the
best
work
the
greatest
economy
is
exercised
in
this
respect
so
that
as
much
power
may
be
kept
in
reserve
as
possible
you
have
only
the
one
scale
from
black
to
white
to
work
with
only
one
octave
within
the
limits
of
which
to
compose
your
tone
symphonies
there
are
no
higher
and
lower
octaves
as
in
music
to
extend
your
effect
so
be
very
sparing
with
your
tone
values
when
modelling
the
different
parts
xiv
unity
of
mass
what
has
been
said
about
unity
of
line
applies
obviously
to
the
outlines
bounding
the
masses
so
that
we
need
not
say
anything
further
on
that
subject
the
particular
quality
of
which
something
should
be
said
is
the
unity
that
is
given
to
a
picture
by
means
of
a
and
rhythmically
considered
scheme
of
tone
values
the
modifications
in
the
relative
tone
values
of
objects
seen
under
different
aspects
of
light
and
atmosphere
are
infinite
and
ever
varying
and
this
is
quite
a
special
study
in
itself
nature
is
the
great
teacher
here
her
tone
arrangements
always
possessing
unity
how
kind
to
the
eye
is
her
attempt
to
cover
the
ugliness
of
our
great
towns
in
an
envelope
of
atmosphere
giving
the
most
wonderful
tone
symphonies
thus
using
man
desecration
of
her
air
by
smoke
to
cover
up
his
other
desecration
of
her
a
manufacturing
town
this
study
of
values
is
a
distinguishing
feature
of
modern
art
but
schemes
taken
from
nature
are
not
the
only
harmonious
ones
the
older
masters
were
content
with
one
or
two
arrangements
of
tone
in
their
pictures
which
were
often
not
at
all
true
to
natural
appearances
but
nevertheless
harmonious
the
chief
instance
of
this
is
the
sky
the
painting
of
flesh
higher
in
tone
than
the
sky
was
almost
universal
at
many
periods
of
art
and
in
portraits
is
still
often
seen
yet
it
is
only
in
strong
sunlight
that
this
is
ever
so
in
nature
as
you
can
easily
see
by
holding
your
hand
up
against
a
sky
background
the
possible
exception
to
this
rule
is
a
dark
in
which
case
your
hand
would
have
to
be
strongly
lit
by
some
bright
light
in
another
part
of
the
sky
to
appear
light
against
it
this
high
tone
of
the
sky
is
a
considerable
difficulty
when
one
wishes
the
interest
centred
on
the
figures
the
eye
instinctively
goes
to
the
light
masses
in
a
picture
and
if
these
masses
are
sky
the
figures
lose
some
importance
the
fashion
of
lowering
its
tone
has
much
to
be
said
for
it
on
the
score
of
the
added
interest
it
gives
to
the
figures
but
it
is
apt
to
bring
a
heavy
stuffy
look
into
the
atmosphere
and
is
only
really
admissible
in
frankly
conventional
treatment
in
which
one
has
not
been
led
to
expect
implicit
truth
to
natural
effect
if
truth
to
natural
appearances
is
carried
far
in
the
figures
the
same
truth
will
be
expected
in
the
background
but
if
only
certain
truths
are
selected
in
the
figures
and
the
treatment
does
not
approach
the
naturalistic
much
more
liberty
can
be
taken
with
the
background
without
loss
of
verisimilitude
but
there
is
a
unity
about
nature
tone
arrangements
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
improve
upon
and
it
is
usually
advisable
if
you
can
to
base
the
scheme
of
tone
in
your
picture
on
a
good
study
of
values
from
nature
such
effects
as
twilight
moonlight
or
even
sunlight
were
seldom
attempted
by
the
older
painters
at
any
rate
in
their
figure
subjects
all
the
lovely
tone
arrangements
that
nature
presents
in
these
more
unusual
aspects
are
a
new
study
and
offer
unlimited
new
material
to
the
artist
many
artists
are
content
to
use
this
simply
for
itself
the
beauty
of
a
rare
tone
effect
being
sufficient
with
the
simplest
accessories
to
make
a
picture
but
in
figure
composition
what
new
and
wonderful
things
can
be
imagined
in
which
some
rare
aspect
of
is
combined
with
a
fine
figure
design
these
values
are
not
easily
perceived
with
accuracy
although
their
influence
may
be
felt
by
many
a
true
eye
for
the
accurate
perception
of
subtle
tone
arrangements
is
a
thing
you
should
study
very
diligently
to
acquire
how
then
is
this
to
be
done
it
is
very
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
teach
anybody
to
see
little
more
can
be
said
than
has
already
been
written
about
this
subject
in
the
chapter
on
variety
in
mass
every
mass
has
to
be
considered
in
relation
to
an
imagined
tone
scale
taking
black
for
your
darkest
and
white
for
your
highest
light
as
we
have
seen
a
black
glass
by
reducing
the
light
enables
you
to
observe
these
relationships
more
accurately
the
dazzling
quality
of
strong
light
making
it
difficult
to
judge
them
but
this
should
only
be
used
to
correct
one
eye
and
the
comparison
should
be
made
between
nature
seen
in
the
glass
and
your
work
seen
also
in
the
glass
to
look
in
a
black
glass
and
then
compare
what
you
saw
with
your
work
looked
at
direct
is
not
a
fair
comparison
and
will
result
in
work
with
little
brilliancy
now
to
represent
this
scale
of
tones
in
painting
we
have
white
paint
as
our
highest
and
black
paint
as
our
lowest
notes
it
is
never
advisable
to
play
either
of
these
extremes
although
you
may
go
very
near
to
them
that
is
to
say
there
should
never
be
pure
white
or
pure
black
masses
in
a
picture
there
is
a
kind
of
screaminess
set
up
when
one
goes
the
whole
gamut
of
tone
that
gives
a
look
of
unrestraint
and
weakness
somewhat
like
the
feeling
experienced
when
a
vocalist
sings
his
or
her
very
highest
or
very
lowest
note
in
a
good
singer
one
always
feels
he
could
have
gone
still
higher
or
still
lower
as
the
case
may
be
and
this
gives
an
added
power
to
the
impression
of
his
singing
and
in
art
likewise
it
is
always
advisable
to
keep
something
of
this
reserve
power
also
the
highest
lights
in
nature
are
never
without
colour
and
this
will
lower
the
tone
neither
are
the
deepest
darks
colourless
and
this
will
raise
their
tone
but
perhaps
this
is
dogmatising
and
it
may
be
that
beautiful
work
is
to
be
done
with
all
the
extremes
you
can
clap
on
though
i
think
it
very
unlikely
in
all
the
quieter
aspects
of
lighting
this
range
from
black
to
white
paint
is
sufficient
but
where
strong
brilliantly
lit
effects
are
wanted
something
has
to
be
sacrificed
if
this
look
of
brilliancy
is
to
be
made
telling
in
order
to
increase
the
relationship
between
some
of
the
tones
others
must
be
sacrificed
there
are
two
ways
of
doing
this
the
first
which
was
the
method
earliest
adopted
is
to
begin
from
the
light
end
of
the
scale
and
taking
something
very
near
pure
white
as
your
highest
light
to
get
the
relationships
between
this
and
the
next
most
brilliant
tone
and
to
proceed
thus
tone
by
tone
from
the
lightest
to
the
darkest
but
working
in
this
way
you
will
find
that
you
arrive
at
the
greatest
dark
you
can
make
in
paint
before
you
have
completed
the
scale
of
relationships
as
in
nature
if
the
subject
happens
to
be
brilliantly
lit
another
method
is
to
put
down
the
highest
light
and
the
darkest
dark
and
then
work
your
scale
of
tone
relatively
between
them
but
it
will
be
found
that
working
in
this
way
unless
the
subject
in
nature
is
very
quietly
lit
you
will
not
get
anything
like
the
forceful
impression
of
tone
that
nature
gives
the
third
way
and
this
is
the
more
modern
is
to
begin
from
the
dark
end
of
the
scale
getting
the
true
relationship
felt
between
the
greatest
dark
and
the
next
darkest
tone
to
it
and
so
on
proceeding
towards
the
light
by
this
method
you
will
arrive
at
your
highest
light
in
paint
before
the
highest
light
in
nature
has
been
reached
all
variety
of
tone
at
the
light
end
of
the
scale
will
have
to
be
modified
in
this
case
instead
of
at
the
dark
end
as
in
the
other
case
in
the
painting
of
sunlight
the
latter
method
is
much
the
more
effective
a
look
of
great
brilliancy
and
light
being
produced
whereas
in
the
earlier
method
the
scale
being
commenced
from
the
light
end
so
much
of
the
picture
was
dark
that
the
impression
of
light
and
air
was
lost
and
a
dark
gloomy
land
took
its
place
a
gloom
accentuated
rather
than
dispelled
by
the
streaks
of
lurid
light
where
the
sun
struck
rembrandt
is
an
example
of
beginning
the
tone
relationships
from
the
light
side
of
the
scale
and
a
large
part
of
his
canvas
is
in
consequence
always
dark
bastien
lepage
is
an
example
of
the
second
method
that
of
fixing
upon
two
extremes
and
between
them
and
it
will
be
noticed
that
he
confined
himself
chiefly
to
quiet
grey
day
effects
of
lighting
the
rendering
of
which
was
well
within
the
range
of
his
palette
the
method
of
beginning
from
the
dark
side
getting
the
true
relations
of
tones
on
this
side
of
the
scale
and
letting
the
lights
take
care
of
themselves
was
perhaps
first
used
by
turner
but
it
is
largely
used
now
whenever
a
strong
impression
of
light
is
desired
the
light
masses
instead
of
the
dark
masses
dominate
the
pictures
which
have
great
brilliancy
these
tone
values
are
only
to
be
perceived
in
their
true
relationship
by
the
eye
contemplating
a
wide
field
of
vision
with
the
ordinary
habit
of
looking
only
at
individual
parts
of
nature
the
general
impression
being
but
dimly
felt
they
are
not
observed
the
artist
has
to
acquire
the
habit
of
generalising
his
visual
attention
over
a
wide
field
if
he
would
perceive
the
true
relation
of
the
parts
to
this
scale
of
values
half
closing
the
eyes
which
is
the
usual
method
of
doing
this
destroys
the
perception
of
a
great
deal
of
colour
another
method
of
throwing
the
eyes
out
of
focus
and
enabling
one
to
judge
of
large
relationships
is
to
dilate
them
widely
this
rather
increases
than
diminishes
the
colour
but
is
not
so
safe
a
method
of
judging
subtle
tone
relationships
it
is
easier
in
approaching
this
study
out
of
doors
to
begin
with
quiet
effects
of
light
some
of
those
soft
grey
days
in
this
country
are
very
beautiful
in
tone
and
change
so
little
that
careful
studies
can
be
made
and
with
indoor
work
place
your
subject
rather
away
from
the
direct
light
and
avoid
much
light
and
shade
let
the
light
come
from
behind
you
if
very
strong
light
effects
such
as
sunlight
or
a
dark
interior
lit
by
one
brilliant
window
are
attempted
the
values
will
be
found
to
be
much
simpler
and
more
harsh
often
resolving
themselves
into
two
masses
a
brilliant
light
contrasted
with
a
dark
shadow
this
tone
arrangement
of
strong
light
in
contrast
with
dark
shadow
was
a
favourite
formula
with
many
schools
of
the
past
since
leonardo
da
vinci
first
used
it
great
breadth
and
splendour
is
given
by
it
to
design
and
it
is
one
of
the
most
impressive
of
tone
arrangements
leonardo
da
our
lady
of
the
rocks
in
the
national
gallery
is
an
early
example
of
this
treatment
and
correggio
venus
mercury
and
cupid
here
reproduced
is
another
particularly
fine
example
reynolds
and
many
of
the
men
used
this
scheme
in
their
work
almost
entirely
this
strong
light
and
shade
by
eliminating
to
a
large
extent
the
half
tones
helps
to
preserve
in
highly
complete
work
a
simplicity
and
directness
of
statement
that
is
very
powerful
for
certain
impressions
it
probably
will
never
be
bettered
but
it
is
a
very
convention
manet
among
the
moderns
has
given
new
life
to
this
formula
although
he
did
not
derive
his
inspiration
directly
from
correggio
but
through
the
spanish
school
by
working
in
a
strong
rather
glaring
direct
light
he
eliminated
still
further
the
half
tones
and
got
rid
to
a
great
extent
of
light
and
shade
coming
at
a
time
when
the
realistic
and
plain
air
movements
were
destroying
simple
directness
his
work
was
of
great
value
bringing
back
as
it
did
with
its
insistence
on
large
simple
masses
a
sense
of
frank
design
his
influence
has
been
very
great
in
recent
years
as
artists
have
felt
that
it
offered
a
new
formula
for
design
and
colour
light
and
shade
and
half
tone
are
the
great
enemies
of
colour
sullying
as
they
do
its
purity
and
to
some
extent
to
design
also
destroying
as
they
do
the
flatness
of
the
picture
but
with
the
strong
direct
light
the
masses
are
cut
out
as
simply
as
possible
and
their
colour
is
little
sullied
by
light
and
shade
the
picture
of
manet
reproduced
is
a
typical
example
of
his
manner
the
aggressive
shape
of
the
pattern
made
by
the
light
mass
against
the
dark
background
is
typical
of
his
revolutionary
attitude
towards
all
accepted
canons
of
beauty
but
even
here
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
many
principles
of
composition
are
conformed
to
the
design
is
united
to
its
boundaries
by
the
horizontal
line
of
the
couch
and
the
vertical
line
of
the
screen
at
the
back
while
the
whole

hangs
on
the
diagonal
from

to

a
fine
example
of
one
of
the
most
effective
tone
arrangements
a
light
mass
on
a
dark
background
large
flat
tones
give
a
power
and
simplicity
to
a
design
and
a
largeness
and
breadth
of
expression
that
are
very
valuable
besides
showing
up
every
little
variety
in
the
values
used
for
your
modelling
and
thus
enabling
you
to
model
with
the
least
expenditure
of
tones
whatever
richness
of
variation
you
may
ultimately
desire
to
add
to
your
values
see
to
it
that
in
planning
your
picture
you
get
a
good
basic
structure
of
simply
designed
and
as
far
as
possible
flat
tones
in
speaking
of
variety
in
mass
we
saw
how
the
nearer
these
tones
are
in
the
scale
of
values
the
more
reserved
and
quiet
the
impression
created
and
the
further
apart
or
greater
the
contrast
the
more
dramatic
and
intense
the
effect
and
the
sentiment
of
tone
in
a
picture
like
the
sentiment
of
line
and
colour
should
be
in
harmony
with
the
nature
of
your
subject
generally
speaking
more
variety
of
tone
and
shape
in
the
masses
of
your
composition
is
permissible
when
a
smaller
range
of
values
is
used
than
when
your
subject
demands
strong
contrasts
when
strong
contrasts
of
tone
or
what
are
called
black
and
white
effects
are
desired
the
masses
must
be
very
simply
designed
were
this
not
so
and
were
the
composition
patterned
all
over
with
smaller
masses
in
strong
contrast
the
breadth
and
unity
of
the
effect
would
be
lost
while
when
the
difference
of
relative
values
between
one
tone
and
another
is
slight
the
oneness
of
effect
is
not
so
much
interfered
with
by
there
being
a
large
number
of
them
effects
of
strong
contrasts
are
therefore
far
the
most
difficult
to
manage
as
it
is
not
easy
to
reduce
a
composition
of
any
complexity
to
a
simple
expressive
pattern
of
large
masses
this
principle
applies
also
in
the
matter
of
colour
greater
contrasts
and
variety
of
colour
may
be
indulged
in
where
the
middle
range
only
of
tones
is
used
and
where
there
is
little
tone
contrast
than
where
there
is
great
contrast
in
other
words
you
can
not
with
much
hope
of
success
have
strong
contrasts
of
colour
and
strong
contrasts
of
tone
in
the
same
picture
it
is
too
violent
if
you
have
strong
contrasts
of
colour
the
contrasts
of
tone
between
them
must
be
small
the
japanese
and
chinese
often
make
the
most
successful
use
of
violent
contrasts
of
colour
by
being
careful
that
they
shall
be
of
the
same
tone
value
and
again
where
you
have
strong
contrasts
of
tone
such
as
rembrandt
was
fond
of
you
can
not
successfully
have
strong
contrasts
of
colour
as
well
reynolds
who
was
fond
both
of
colour
and
strong
tone
contrast
had
to
compromise
as
he
tells
us
in
his
lectures
by
making
the
shadows
all
the
same
brown
colour
to
keep
a
harmony

and
a
great

that

suggested
by

an
obvious
instance
of
this
and
for
the

harmonic
cause
a
calm
evening

so
peaceful
and
infinite
an
expression
the
waning
light
darkens
the
land
and
increases
the
contrast
between
it
and
the
sky
with
the
result
that
all
the
landscape
towards
the
west
is
reduced
to
practically
one
dark
tone
cutting
sharply
against
the
wide
light
of
the

and
the
graceful
charm
of
curved
lines

through

its
analogy

watteau

masters

this

alluring
compositions
the

founded
on
a
principle
of
swinging
and
interlacing
with
each
other
in
harmonious
rhythm
throughout
the

large
flat
tones
with
their
more
thoughtful
associations
are
out
of
place
here
and
are
seldom
if
ever
used
in
their
work
we
see
a
world
where
the
saddening
influences
of
profound
thought
and
its
expression
are
far
away
no
deeper
notes
are
allowed
to
mar
the
gaiety
of
this
holiday
world
watteau
created
a
dream
country
of
his
own
in
which
a
tired
humanity
has
delighted
ever
since
in
which
all
serious
thoughts
are
far
away
and
the
mind
takes
refreshment
in
the
contemplation
of
delightful
things
and
a
great
deal
of
this
charm
is
due
to
the
pretty
play
from
a
crescendo
to
a
diminuendo
in
the
tone
values
on
which
his
compositions
are
based
so
far
removed
from
the
simple
structure
of
flat
masses

which
more
primitive

austere
art

although
you
search
the

for
the

you
not

turner
was
very
fond

these

them

which
they
had
never
before
attained
his
ulysses
deriding
polyphemus
in
the
national
gallery
of
british
art
is
a
splendid
example
of
his
use
of
this
principle
a
great
unity
of
expression
is
given
by
bringing
the
greatest
dark
and
light
together
in
sharp
contrast
as
is
done
in
this
picture

the
dark
rocks

prows

against
the
rising
sun
from
this
point
the
dark
and
light
masses
gradate
in
different
directions
until
they
merge
above
the
sails
these
sails
cut
sharply
into
the
dark
mass
as
the
rocks
and
ship
on
the
extreme

cut
sharply
into
the
light
mass
note
also
the
edges
where
they
are
accented
and
come
sharply
against
the
neighbouring
mass
and
where
they
are
lost
and
the
pleasing
quality
this
play
of
edges
gives
stability
is
given
by
the
line
of
the
horizon
and
waves
in
front
and
the
masts
of
the
ships
the
oars
and
in
the
original
picture
a
feeling
of
radiating
lines
from
the
rising
sun
without
these
steadying
influences
these
compositions
of
gradated
masses
would
be

little

the

got
with
the

the

and
the
infinite

giving
to
this
simple
structure
a
richness
and
beauty

that
is
very
satisfying

given
by
the

it
is
not
only
in
the
larger
disposition
of
the
masses
in
a
composition
that
this
principle
of
gradated
masses
and
lost
and
found
edges
can
be
used
wherever
grace
and
charm
are
your
motive
they
should
be
looked
for
in
the
working
out
of
the
smallest
details
in
concluding
this
chapter
i
must
again
insist
that
knowledge
of
these
matters
will
not
make
you
compose
a
good
picture
a
composition
may
be
perfect
as
far
as
any
rules
or
principles
of
composition
go
and
yet
be
of
no
account
whatever
the
quality
in
art
always
defies
analysis
and
refuses
to
be
tabulated
in
any
formula
this
vital
quality
in
drawing
and
composition
must
come
from
the
individual
artist
himself
and
nobody
can
help
him
much
here
he
must
ever
be
on
the
look
out
for
those
visions
his
imagination
stirs
within
him
and
endeavour
however
haltingly
at
first
to
give
them
some
sincere
expression
try
always
when
your
mind
is
filled
with
some
pictorial
idea
to
get
something
put
down
a
mere
fumbled
expression
possibly
but
it
may
contain
the
germ
later
on
the
same
idea
may
occur
to
you
again
only
it
will
be
less
vague
this
time
and
a
process
of
development
will
have
taken
place
it
may
be
years
before
it
takes
sufficiently
definite
shape
to
justify
a
picture
the
process
of
germination
in
the
mind
is
a
slow
one
but
try
and
acquire
the
habit
of
making
some
record
of
what
pictorial
ideas
pass
in
the
mind
and
do
wait
until
you
can
draw
and
paint
well
to
begin
qualities
of
drawing
and
painting
do
matter
a
bit
here
it
is
the
sensation
the
feeling
for
the
picture
that
is
everything
if
knowledge
of
the
rhythmic
properties
of
lines
and
masses
will
not
enable
you
to
compose
a
fine
picture
you
may
well
ask
what
is
their
use
there
may
be
those
to
whom
they
are
of
no
use
their
artistic
instincts
are
sufficiently
strong
to
need
no
direction
but
such
natures
are
rare
and
it
is
doubtful
if
they
ever
go
far
while
many
a
painter
might
be
saved
a
lot
of
worry
over
something
in
his
picture
that
come
did
he
but
know
more
of
the
principle
of
pictorial
design
his
work
is
transgressing
i
feel
certain
that
the
old
painters
like
the
venetians
were
far
more
systematic
and
had
far
more
hard
and
fast
principles
of
design
than
ourselves
they
knew
the
science
of
their
craft
so
well
that
they
did
not
so
often
have
to
call
upon
their
artistic
instinct
to
get
them
out
of
difficulties
their
artistic
instinct
was
free
to
attend
to
higher
things
their
knowledge
of
the
science
of
keeping
them
from
many
petty
mistakes
that
a
modern
artist
falls
into
the
desire
of
so
many
artists
in
these
days
to
cut
loose
from
tradition
and
start
all
over
again
puts
a
very
severe
strain
upon
their
intuitive
faculties
and
keeps
them
occupied
correcting
things
that
more
knowledge
of
some
of
the
fundamental
principles
that
do
really
alter
and
that
are
the
same
in
all
schools
would
have
saved
them
knowledge
in
art
is
like
a
railway
built
behind
the
pioneers
who
have
gone
before
it
offers
a
point
of
departure
for
those
who
come
after
further
on
into
the
unknown
country
of
secrets
a
help
not
lightly
to
be
discarded
but
all
artifice
in
art
must
be
concealed
a
picture
obviously
composed
is
badly
composed
in
a
good
composition
it
is
as
though
the
parts
had
been
carefully
placed
in
rhythmic
relation
and
then
the
picture
jarred
a
little
so
that
everything
is
slightly
shifted
out
of
place
thus
introducing
our
dither
or
play
of
life
between
the
parts
of
course
no
mechanical
jogging
will
introduce
the
vital
quality
referred
to
which
must
come
from
the
vitality
of
the
artist
intuition
although
i
have
heard
of
photographers
jogging
the
camera
in
an
endeavour
to
introduce
some
artistic
play
in
its
mechanical
renderings
but
one
must
say
something
to
show
how
in
all
good
composition
the
mechanical
principles
at
the
basis
of
the
matter
are
subordinate
to
a
vital
principle
on
which
the
life
in
the
work
depends
this
concealment
of
all
artifice
this
artlessness
and
spontaneity
of
appearance
is
one
of
the
greatest
qualities
in
a
composition
any
analysis
of
which
is
futile
it
is
what
occasionally
gives
to
the
work
of
the
unlettered
genius
so
great
a
charm
but
the
artist
in
whom
the
true
spark
has
not
been
quenched
by
worldly
success
or
other
enervating
influence
keeps
the
secret
of
this
freshness
right
on
the
culture
of
his
student
days
being
used
only
to
give
it
splendour
of
expression
but
never
to
stifle
or
suppress
its
native
charm
xv
balance
there
seems
to
be
a
strife
between
opposing
forces
at
the
basis
of
all
things
a
strife
in
which
a
perfect
balance
is
never
attained
or
life
would
cease
the
worlds
are
kept
on
their
courses
by
such
opposing
forces
the
perfect
equilibrium
never
being
found
and
so
the
vitalising
movement
is
kept
up
states
are
held
together
on
the
same
principle
no
state
seeming
able
to
preserve
a
balance
for
long
new
forces
arise
the
balance
is
upset
and
the
state
totters
until
a
new
equilibrium
has
been
found
it
would
seem
however
to
be
the
aim
of
life
to
strive
after
balance
any
violent
deviation
from
which
is
accompanied
by
calamity
and
in
art
we
have
the
same
play
of
opposing
factors
straight
lines
and
curves
light
and
dark
warm
and
cold
colour
oppose
each
other
were
the
balance
between
them
perfect
the
result
would
be
dull
and
dead
but
if
the
balance
is
very
much
out
the
eye
is
disturbed
and
the
effect
too
disquieting
it
will
naturally
be
in
pictures
that
aim
at
repose
that
this
balance
will
be
most
perfect
in
more
exciting
subjects
less
will
be
necessary
but
some
amount
should
exist
in
every
picture
no
matter
how
turbulent
its
motive
as
in
good
tragedy
the
horror
of
the
situation
is
never
allowed
to
overbalance
the
beauty
of
the
treatment
sidenote
between
straight
lines
and
curves
let
us
consider
in
the
first
place
the
balance
between
straight
lines
and
curves
the
richer
and
fuller
the
curves
the
more
severe
should
be
the
straight
lines
that
balance
them
if
perfect
repose
is
desired
but
if
the
subject
demands
excess
of
movement
and
life
of
course
there
will
be
less
necessity
for
the
balancing
influence
of
straight
lines
and
on
the
other
hand
if
the
subject
demands
an
excess
of
repose
and
contemplation
the
bias
will
be
on
the
side
of
straight
lines
but
a
picture
composed
entirely
of
rich
rolling
curves
is
too
disquieting
a
thing
to
contemplate
and
would
become
very
irritating
of
the
two
extremes
one
composed
entirely
of
straight
lines
would
be
preferable
to
one
with
no
squareness
to
relieve
the
richness
of
the
curves
for
straight
lines
are
significant
of
the
deeper
and
more
permanent
things
of
life
of
the
powers
that
govern
and
restrain
and
of
infinity
while
the
rich
curves
that
is
curves
the
farthest
removed
from
the
straight
line
seem
to
be
expressive
of
uncontrolled
energy
and
the
more
exuberant
joys
of
life
vice
may
be
excess
in
any
direction
but
asceticism
has
generally
been
accepted
as
a
nobler
vice
than
voluptuousness
the
rococo
art
of
the
eighteenth
century
is
an
instance
of
the
excessive
use
of
curved
forms
and
like
all
excesses
in
the
joys
of
life
it
is
vicious
and
is
the
favourite
style
of
decoration
in
vulgar
places
of
entertainment
the
excessive
use
of
straight
lines
and
square
forms
may
be
seen
in
some
ancient
egyptian
architecture
but
this
severity
was
originally
no
doubt
softened
by
the
use
of
colour
and
in
any
case
it
is
nobler
and
finer
than
the
vicious
cleverness
of
rococo
art
we
have
seen
how
the
greeks
balanced
the
straight
lines
of
their
architectural
forms
with
the
rich
lines
of
the
sculpture
which
they
used
so
lavishly
on
their
temples
but
the
balance
was
always
kept
on
the
side
of
the
square
forms
and
never
on
the
side
of
undue
roundness
and
it
is
on
this
side
that
the
balance
would
seem
to
be
in
the
finest
art
even
the
finest
curves
are
those
that
approach
the
straight
line
rather
than
the
circle
that
err
on
the
side
of
flatnesses
rather
than
roundnesses
sidenote
between
flat
and
gradated
tones
what
has
been
said
about
the
balance
of
straight
lines
and
curves
applies
equally
well
to
tones
if
for
straight
lines
you
substitute
flat
tones
and
for
curved
lines
gradated
tones
the
deeper
more
permanent
things
find
expression
in
the
wider
flatter
tones
while
an
excess
of
gradations
makes
for
prettiness
if
not
for
the
gross
roundnesses
of
vicious
modelling
often
when
a
picture
is
hopelessly
out
of
gear
and
mucked
up
as
they
say
in
the
studio
it
can
be
got
on
the
right
road
again
by
reducing
it
to
a
basis
of
flat
tones
going
over
it
and
painting
out
the
gradations
getting
it
back
to
a
simpler
equation
from
which
the
right
road
to
completion
can
be
more
readily
seen
overmuch
concern
with
the
gradations
of
the
smaller
modelling
is
a
very
common
reason
of
pictures
and
drawings
getting
out
of
gear
the
less
expenditure
of
tone
values
you
can
express
your
modelling
with
the
better
as
a
general
rule
the
balance
in
the
finest
work
is
usually
on
the
side
of
flat
tones
rather
than
on
the
side
of
gradated
tones
work
that
errs
on
the
side
of
gradations
like
that
of
greuze
however
popular
its
appeal
is
much
poorer
stuff
than
work
that
errs
on
the
side
of
flatness
in
tone
like
giotto
and
the
italian
primitives
or
puvis
de
chavannes
among
the
moderns
sidenote
between
light
and
dark
tones
there
is
a
balance
of
tone
set
up
also
between
light
and
dark
between
black
and
white
in
the
scale
of
tone
pictures
that
do
not
go
far
in
the
direction
of
light
starting
from
a
middle
tone
should
not
go
far
in
the
direction
of
dark
either
in
this
respect
note
the
pictures
of
whistler
a
great
master
in
matters
of
tone
his
lights
seldom
approach
anywhere
near
white
and
on
the
other
hand
his
darks
never
approach
black
in
tone
when
the
highest
lights
are
low
in
tone
the
darkest
darks
should
be
high
in
tone
painters
like
rembrandt
whose
pictures
when
fresh
must
have
approached
very
near
white
in
the
high
lights
also
approach
black
in
the
darks
and
nearer
our
own
time
frank
holl
forced
the
whites
of
his
pictures
very
high
and
correspondingly
the
darks
were
very
heavy
and
when
this
balance
is
kept
there
is
a
rightness
about
it
that
is
instinctively
felt
we
do
not
mean
that
the
amount
of
light
tones
in
a
picture
should
be
balanced
by
the
amount
of
dark
tones
but
that
there
should
be
some
balance
between
the
extremes
of
light
and
dark
used
in
the
tone
scheme
of
a
picture
the
old
rule
was
i
believe
that
a
picture
should
be
light
and
dark
but
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
rule
to
be
observed
here
there
are
too
many
exceptions
and
no
mention
is
made
of
half
tones
like
all
laws
in
art
this
rule
is
capable
of
many
apparent
exceptions
there
is
the
white
picture
in
which
all
the
tones
are
high
but
in
some
of
the
most
successful
of
these
you
will
generally
find
spots
of
intensely
dark
pigment
turner
was
fond
of
these
light
pictures
in
his
later
manner
but
he
usually
put
in
some
dark
spot
such
as
the
black
gondolas
in
some
of
his
venetian
pictures
that
illustrate
the
law
of
balance
we
are
speaking
of
and
are
usually
put
in
excessively
dark
in
proportion
as
the
rest
of
the
picture
is
excessively
light
the
successful
pictures
are
generally
painted
in
the
middle
tones
and
thus
do
not
in
any
way
contradict
our
principle
of
balance
sidenote
between
warm
and
cold
colours
one
is
tempted
at
this
point
to
wander
a
little
into
the
province
of
colour
where
the
principle
of
balance
of
which
we
are
speaking
is
much
felt
the
scale
here
being
between
warm
and
cold
colours
if
you
divide
the
solar
spectrum
roughly
into
half
you
will
have
the
reds
oranges
and
yellows
on
one
side
and
the
purples
blues
and
greens
on
the
other
the
former
being
roughly
the
warm
and
the
latter
the
cold
colours
the
clever
manipulation
of
the
opposition
between
these
warm
and
cold
colours
is
one
of
the
chief
means
used
in
giving
vitality
to
colouring
but
the
point
to
notice
here
is
that
the
further
your
colouring
goes
in
the
direction
of
warmth
the
further
it
will
be
necessary
to
go
in
the
opposite
direction
to
right
the
balance
that
is
how
it
comes
about
that
painters
like
titian
who
loved
a
warm
glowing
golden
colouring
so
often
had
to
put
a
mass
of
the
coldest
blue
in
their
pictures
gainsborough
blue
boy
although
done
in
defiance
of
reynolds
principle
is
no
contradiction
of
our
rule
for
although
the
boy
has
a
blue
dress
all
the
rest
of
the
picture
is
warm
brown
and
so
the
balance
is
kept
it
is
the
failure
to
observe
this
balance
that
makes
so
many
of
the
huntsmen
and
soldiers
portraits
in
our
exhibitions
so
objectionable
they
are
too
often
painted
on
a
dark
hot
burnt
sienna
and
black
background
with
nothing
but
warm
colours
in
the
flesh
with
the
result
that
the
screaming
heat
is
intolerable
with
a
hot
mass
of
red
like
a
huntsman
coat
in
your
picture
the
coolest
colour
should
be
looked
for
everywhere
else
seen
in
a
november
landscape
how
well
a
huntsman
coat
looks
but
then
how
cold
and
grey
is
the
colouring
of
the
landscape
the
right
thing
to
do
is
to
support
your
red
with
as
many
cool
and
neutral
tones
as
possible
and
avoid
hot
shadows
with
so
strong
a
red
blue
might
be
too
much
of
a
contrast
unless
your
canvas
was
large
enough
to
admit
of
its
being
introduced
at
some
distance
from
the
red
most
painters
of
course
are
content
to
keep
to
middle
courses
never
going
very
far
in
the
warm
or
cold
directions
and
undoubtedly
much
more
freedom
of
action
is
possible
here
although
the
results
may
not
be
so
powerful
but
when
beauty
and
refinement
of
sentiment
rather
than
force
are
desired
the
middle
range
of
colouring
that
is
to
say
all
colours
partly
neutralised
by
admixture
with
their
opposites
is
much
safer
sidenote
between
interest
and
mass
there
is
another
form
of
balance
that
must
be
although
it
is
connected
more
with
the
subject
matter
of
art
as
it
concerns
the
mental
significance
of
objects
rather
than
rhythmic
qualities
possessed
by
lines
and
masses
i
refer
to
the
balance
there
is
between
interest
and
mass
the
interest
of
the
human
figure
makes
it
often
when
quite
minute
in
scale
balance
the
weight
and
interest
of
a
great
mass
diagram
xxvii
is
a
rough
instance
of
what
is
meant
without
the
little
figure
the
composition
would
be
out
of
balance
but
the
weight
of
interest
centred
upon
that
lonely
little
person
is
enough
to
right
the
balance
occasioned
by
the
great
mass
of
trees
on
the
left
figures
are
largely
used
by
landscape
painters
in
this
way
and
are
of
great
use
in
restoring
balance
in
a
picture

illustrating
how
interest
may
balance
mass
sidenote
between
variety
and
unity
and
lastly
there
must
be
a
balance
struck
between
variety
and
unity
a
great
deal
has
already
been
said
about
this
and
it
will
only
be
necessary
to
recapitulate
here
that
to
variety
is
due
all
the
expression
or
the
picturesque
of
the
joyous
energy
of
life
and
all
that
makes
the
world
such
a
delightful
place
but
that
to
unity
belongs
the
relating
of
this
variety
to
the
underlying
principles
that
support
it
in
nature
and
in
all
good
art
it
will
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
artist
and
on
the
nature
of
his
theme
how
far
this
underlying
unity
will
dominate
the
expression
in
his
work
and
how
far
it
will
be
overlaid
and
hidden
behind
a
rich
garment
of
variety
but
both
ideas
must
be
considered
in
his
work
if
the
unity
of
his
conception
is
allowed
to
exclude
variety
entirely
it
will
result
in
a
dead
abstraction
and
if
the
variety
is
to
be
allowed
none
of
the
restraining
influences
of
unity
it
will
develop
into
a
riotous
extravagance
xvi
rhythm
proportion
rules
and
canons
of
proportion
designed
to
reduce
to
a
mathematical
formula
the
things
that
move
us
in
beautiful
objects
have
not
been
a
great
success
the
beautiful
will
always
defy
such
clumsy
analysis
but
however
true
it
is
that
beauty
of
proportion
must
ever
be
the
result
of
the
finer
senses
of
the
artist
it
is
possible
that
canons
of
proportion
such
as
those
of
the
human
body
may
be
of
service
to
the
artist
by
offering
some
standard
from
which
he
can
depart
at
the
dictates
of
his
artistic
instinct
there
appears
to
be
no
doubt
that
the
ancient
sculptors
used
some
such
system
and
many
of
the
renaissance
painters
were
interested
in
the
subject
leonardo
da
vinci
having
much
to
say
about
it
in
his
book
like
all
scientific
knowledge
in
art
it
fails
to
trap
the
elusive
something
that
is
the
vital
essence
of
the
whole
matter
but
such
scientific
knowledge
does
help
to
bring
one
work
up
to
a
high
point
of
mechanical
perfection
from
which
one
artistic
instinct
can
soar
with
a
better
chance
of
success
than
if
no
scientific
scaffolding
had
been
used
in
the
initial
building
up
yet
however
perfect
your
system
forget
that
the
life
the
dither
will
still
have
to
be
accounted
for
and
no
science
will
help
you
here
the
idea
that
certain
mathematical
proportions
or
relationships
underlie
the
phenomena
we
call
beauty
is
very
ancient
and
too
abstruse
to
trouble
us
here
but
undoubtedly
proportion
the
quantitative
relation
of
the
parts
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
forms
a
very
important
part
in
the
impression
works
of
art
and
objects
give
us
and
should
be
a
subject
of
the
greatest
consideration
in
planning
your
work
the
mathematical
relationship
of
these
quantities
is
a
subject
that
has
always
fascinated
scholars
who
have
measured
the
antique
statues
accurately
and
painstakingly
to
find
the
secret
of
their
charm
science
by
showing
that
different
sounds
and
different
colours
are
produced
by
waves
of
different
lengths
and
that
therefore
different
colours
and
sounds
can
be
expressed
in
terms
of
numbers
has
certainly
opened
the
door
to
a
new
consideration
of
this
subject
of
beauty
in
relation
to
mathematics
and
the
result
of
such
an
inquiry
if
it
is
being
or
has
been
carried
on
will
be
of
much
interest
but
there
is
something
chilling
to
the
artist
in
an
array
of
dead
figures
for
he
has
a
consciousness
that
the
life
of
the
whole
matter
will
never
be
captured
by
such
mechanical
means
the
question
we
are
interested
to
ask
here
is
are
there
particular
sentiments
connected
with
the
different
relations
of
quantities
their
proportions
as
we
found
there
were
in
connection
with
different
arrangements
of
lines
and
masses
have
abstract
proportions
any
significance
in
art
as
we
found
abstract
line
and
mass
arrangements
had
it
is
a
difficult
thing
to
be
definite
about
and
i
can
only
give
my
own
feeling
on
the
matter
but
i
think
in
some
degree
they
have
proportion
can
be
considered
from
our
two
points
of
view
of
unity
and
variety
in
so
far
as
the
proportions
of
any
picture
or
object
resolve
themselves
into
a
simple
easily
grasped
unity
of
relationship
a
sense
of
repose
and
sublimity
is
produced
in
so
far
as
the
variety
of
proportion
in
the
different
parts
is
assertive
and
prevents
the
eye
grasping
the
arrangement
as
a
simple
whole
a
sense
of
the
lively
restlessness
of
life
and
activity
is
produced
in
other
words
as
we
found
in
line
arrangements
unity
makes
for
sublimity
while
variety
makes
for
the
expression
of
life
of
course
the
scale
of
the
object
will
have
something
to
do
with
this
that
is
to
say
the
most
sublimely
proportioned
could
never
give
us
the
impression
of
sublimity
produced
by
a
great
temple
in
pictures
the
scale
of
the
work
is
not
of
so
great
importance
a
painting
or
drawing
having
the
power
of
giving
the
impression
of
great
size
on
a
small
scale
the
proportion
that
is
most
easily
grasped
is
the
half
two
equal
parts
this
is
the
most
devoid
of
variety
and
therefore
of
life
and
is
only
used
when
an
effect
of
great
repose
and
aloofness
from
life
is
wanted
and
even
then
never
without
some
variety
in
the
minor
parts
to
give
vitality
the
third
and
the
quarter
and
in
fact
any
equal
proportions
are
others
that
are
easily
grasped
and
partake
in
a
lesser
degree
of
the
same
qualities
as
the
half
so
that
equality
of
proportion
should
be
avoided
except
on
those
rare
occasions
when
effects
remote
from
nature
and
life
are
desired
nature
seems
to
abhor
equalities
never
making
two
things
alike
or
the
same
proportion
if
she
can
help
it
all
systems
founded
on
equalities
as
are
so
many
modern
systems
of
social
reform
are
man
work
the
products
of
a
age
for
this
is
the
difference
between
nature
and
the
machine
nature
never
produces
two
things
alike
the
machine
never
produces
two
things
different
man
could
solve
the
social
problem
if
you
could
produce
him
equal
units
but
if
all
men
were
alike
and
equal
where
would
be
the
life
and
fun
of
existence
it
would
depart
with
the
variety
and
in
proportion
as
in
life
variety
is
the
secret
of
vitality
only
to
be
suppressed
where
a
static
effect
is
wanted
in
architecture
equality
of
proportion
is
more
often
met
with
as
the
static
qualities
of
repose
are
of
more
importance
here
than
in
painting
one
meets
it
on
all
fine
buildings
in
such
things
as
rows
of
columns
and
windows
of
equal
size
and
distances
apart
or
the
continual
repetition
of
the
same
forms
in
mouldings
but
even
here
in
the
best
work
some
variety
is
allowed
to
keep
the
effect
from
being
quite
dead
the
columns
on
the
outside
of
a
greek
pediment
being
nearer
together
and
leaning
slightly
inwards
and
the
repeated
forms
of
windows
columns
and
mouldings
being
infinitely
varied
in
themselves
but
although
you
often
find
repetitions
of
the
same
forms
equidistant
in
architecture
it
is
seldom
that
equality
of
proportion
is
observable
in
the
main
distribution
of
the
large
masses

us

an

post

it

us
introduce
two
spots
that
may
indicate
the
position
of
birds
in
the
upper
spaces
on
either
side
of
this

we
have
a
maximum
of
equality
and
the
deadest
and
most
static
of
results

see
these
diagrams

it
is
necessary
to
cover
over
with
some
pieces
of
notepaper

but
the

so

the

by

a
typical
example
of
static
balance
in
composition
in

pictures
of
the
madonna

a
hush
and

are
desired

than

but
having
got
the
repose
this
centralisation
gives
everything

done
to
conceal
this
equality
and
variety
in
the
contours
on
either
side
and
in
any
figures
there
may
be

carefully
sought
raphael
ansidei
madonna
in
the
national
gallery
is
an
instance
of
this
you
have
first
the
centralisation
of
the
figure
of
the
madonna
with
the
throne
on
which
she
sits
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
picture
not
only
is
the
throne
in
the
centre
of
the
picture
but
its
width
is
exactly
that
of
the
spaces
on
either
side
of
it
giving
us
three
equal
proportions
across
the
picture
then
you
have
the
circular
lines
of
the
arches
behind
curves
possessed
of
the
least
possible
amount
of
variety
and
therefore
the
calmest
and
most
reposeful
while
the
horizontal
lines
of
the
steps
and
the
vertical
lines
of
the
throne
and
architecture
and
also
the
rows
of
hanging
beads
give
further
emphasis
to
this
infinity
of
calm
but
when
we
come
to
the
figures
this
symmetry
has
been
varied
everywhere
all
the
heads
swing
towards
the
right
while
the
lines
of
the
draperies
swing
freely
in
many
directions
the
swing
of
the
heads
towards
the
right
is
balanced
and
the
eye
brought
back
to
equilibrium
by
the
staff
of
nicholas
on

of

necessary

very
slightly

on

as
if

so
as
not
to
increase
the

by

it
is
interesting
to
note
the
fruit
introduced
at
the
last
moment
in
the
lower
corner
dragged
in
as
it
were
to
restore
the
balance
occasioned
by
the
figure
of
the
christ
being
on
the
left
in
the
writer
humble
opinion
the
extremely
obvious
artifice
with
which
the
lines
have
been
balanced
and
the
severity
of
the
convention
of
this
composition
generally
are
out
of
harmony
with
the
amount
of
naturalistic
detail
and
particularly
of
solidity
allowed
in
the
treatment
of
the
figures
and
accessories
the
small
amount
of
truth
to
visual
nature
in
the
work
of
earlier
men
went
better
with
the
formality
of
such
compositions
with
so
little
of
the
variety
of
life
in
their
treatment
of
natural
appearances
one
was
not
led
to
demand
so
much
of
the
variety
of
life
in
the
arrangement
it
is
the
simplicity
and
remoteness
from
the
full
effect
of
natural
appearances
in
the
work
of
the
early
italian
schools
that
made
their
painting
such
a
ready
medium
for
the
expression
of
religious
subjects
this
atmosphere
of
where
the
music
of
line
and
colour
was
uninterrupted
by
any
aggressive
look
of
real
things
is
a
better
convention
for
the
expression
of
such
ideas
and
emotions

does
the

a

static

kept
up

only
which

as
we

despite

think
the
added
life
due

the
variety
in

is
sufficiently
apparent
in

we

placed

their

note
the

emphasis
given
to
the
outstretched
hand
of
the
powerful
figure
of
the
apostle
on

left
by
the
lines
of
the
architecture
and
the
line
of
arm
of
the
kneeling
figure
in
the
centre
of
the
picture
converging
on
this
hand
and
leading
the
eye
immediately
to
it
there
is
here
no
static

all
is
energy
and
force
starting
with
this
arresting
arm
the
eye
is
led
down
the
majestic
figure
of
mark
past
the
recumbent
figure
and
across
the
picture
by
means
of
the
band
of

on
the
ground
to
the
important
group
of
frightened
figures
on
the
right
and
from
them
on
to
the
figures
engaged
in
lowering
a
corpse
from
its
tomb
or
following
the
direction
of
the
outstretched
arm
of

we
are
led
by

straight
away

back
again

quantities
are
not
placed
in
reposeful
symmetry
about

as
was
the
case
in
the
raphael
but
are
thrown
off
apparently
haphazard
from
lines
leading
the
eye
round
the
picture
note
also
the
dramatic
intensity
given
by
the
strongly
contrasted
light
and
shade
and
how
tintoretto
has
enjoyed
the
weird
effect
of
the
two
figures
looking
into
a
tomb
with
a
light
their
shadows
being
thrown
on
the
lid
they
hold
open
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
this
must
have
been
an
amazingly
new
piece
of
realism
at
the
time
and
is
wonderfully
used
to
give
an
eerie
effect
to
the
darkened
end
of
the
room
with
his
boundless
energy
and
full
enjoyment

a

that

that

the
variety
of
proportions
in

a

should
always
be
under
the
control
of
a

simple
dominant
quantities
that
simplify
the
appearance
and
give
it
a

is

where
violence

there
is
something
in
every
individual
that
is
likely
for
a
long
time
to
defy
the
analysis
of
science
when
you
have
summed
up
the
total
of
atoms
or
electrons
or
whatever
it
is
that
goes
to
the
making
of
the
tissues
and
also
the
innumerable
complex
functions
performed
by
the
different
parts
you
have
not
yet
got
on
the
track
of
the
individual
that
governs
the
whole
performance
the
effect
of
this
personality
on
the
outward
form
and
the
influence
it
has
in
modifying
the
aspect
of
body
and
features
are
the
things
that
concern
the
portrait
draughtsman
the
seizing
on
and
expressing
forcefully
the
individual
character
of
the
sitter
as
expressed
by
his
outward
appearance
this
character
expression
in
form
has
been
thought
to
be
somewhat
antagonistic
to
beauty
and
many
sitters
are
shy
of
the
particular
characteristics
of
their
own
features
the
fashionable
photographer
knowing
this
carefully
stipples
out
of
his
negative
any
striking
characteristics
in
the
form
of
his
sitter
the
negative
may
show
but
judging
by
the
result
it
is
doubtful
whether
any
beauty
has
been
gained
and
certain
that
interest
and
vitality
have
been
lost
in
the
process
whatever
may
be
the
nature
of
beauty
it
is
obvious
that
what
makes
one
object
more
beautiful
than
another
is
something
that
is
characteristic
of
the
appearance
of
the
one
and
not
of
the
other
so
that
some
close
study
of
individual
characteristics
must
be
the
aim
of
the
artist
who
would
seek
to
express
beauty
as
well
as
the
artist
who
seeks
the
expression
of
character
and
professes
no
interest
in
beauty
catching
the
likeness
as
it
is
called
is
simply
seizing
on
the
essential
things
that
belong
only
to
a
particular
individual
and
differentiate
that
individual
from
others
and
expressing
them
in
a
forceful
manner
there
are
certain
things
that
are
common
to
the
whole
species
likeness
to
a
common
type
the
individual
likeness
is
not
in
this
direction
but
at
the
opposite
pole
to
it
it
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
things
connected
with
the
amazing
subtlety
of
appreciation
possessed
by
the
human
eye
that
of
the
millions
of
heads
in
the
world
and
probably
of
all
that
have
ever
existed
in
the
world
no
two
look
exactly
alike
when
one
considers
how
alike
they
are
and
how
very
restricted
is
the
range
of
difference
between
them
is
it
not
remarkable
how
quickly
the
eye
recognises
one
person
from
another
it
is
more
remarkable
still
how
one
sometimes
recognises
a
friend
not
seen
for
many
years
and
whose
appearance
has
changed
considerably
in
the
meantime
and
this
likeness
that
we
recognise
is
not
so
much
as
is
generally
thought
a
matter
of
the
individual
features
if
one
sees
the
eye
alone
the
remainder
of
the
face
being
covered
it
is
almost
impossible
to
recognise
even
a
friend
or
tell
whether
the
expression
is
that
of
laughing
or
crying
and
again
how
difficult
it
is
to
recognise
anybody
when
the
eyes
are
masked
and
only
the
lower
part
of
the
face
visible
illustration

note
how
every
bit
of
variety
is
sought
for
the
difference
in
the
eyes
and
on
either
side
of
the
mouth
etc
if
you
try
and
recall
a
head
it
will
not
be
the
shape
of
the
features
that
will
be
recollected
so
much
as
an
impression
the
result
of
all
these
combined
a
sort
of
chord
of
which
the
features
will
be
but
the
component
elements
it
is
the
relation
of
the
different
parts
to
this
chord
this
impression
of
the
personality
of
a
head
that
is
the
thing
in
what
is
popularly
called
catching
the
likeness
in
drawing
a
portrait
the
mind
must
be
centred
on
this
and
all
the
individual
parts
drawn
in
relation
to
it
the
moment
the
eye
gets
interested
solely
in
some
individual
part
and
forgets
the
consideration
of
its
relationship
to
this
whole
impression
the
likeness
suffers
where
there
is
so
much
that
is
similar
in
heads
it
is
obvious
that
what
differences
there
are
must
be
searched
out
and
seized
upon
forcefully
if
the
individuality
of
the
head
is
to
be
made
telling
the
drawing
of
portraits
should
therefore
be
approached
from
the
direction
of
these
differences
that
is
to
say
the
things
in
general
disposition
and
proportion
in
which
your
subject
differs
from
a
common
type
should
be
first
sought
for
the
things
common
to
all
heads
being
left
to
take
care
of
themselves
for
a
bit
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
eye
when
fresh
sees
these
differences
much
more
readily
than
after
it
has
been
working
for
some
time
the
tendency
of
a
tired
eye
is
to
see
less
differentiation
and
to
hark
back
to
a
dull
uniformity
so
get
in
touch
at
once
with
the
vital
differences
while
your
eye
is
fresh
and
your
vision
keen
look
out
first
for
the
character
of
the
disposition
of
the
features
note
the
proportions
down
an
imagined
centre
line
of
the
brows
the
base
of
the
nose
the
mouth
and
chin
and
get
the
character
of
the
shape
of
the
enclosing
line
of
the
face
blocked
out
in
square
lines
the
great
importance
of
getting
these
proportions
right
early
can
not
be
as
any
mistake
may
later
on
necessitate
completely
shifting
a
carefully
drawn
feature
and
the
importance
of
this
may
be
judged
from
the
fact
that
you
recognise
a
head
a
long
way
off
before
anything
but
the
general
disposition
of
the
masses
surrounding
the
features
can
be
seen
the
shape
of
the
skull
too
is
another
thing
of
which
to
get
an
early
idea
and
its
relation
to
the
face
should
be
carefully
noted
but
it
is
impossible
to
lay
down
hard
and
fast
rules
for
these
things
some
artists
begin
in
point
drawing
with
the
eyes
and
some
leave
the
eyes
until
the
very
last
some
draughtsmen
are
never
happy
until
they
have
an
eye
to
adjust
the
head
round
treating
it
as
the
centre
of
interest
and
drawing
the
parts
relatively
to
it
while
others
say
with
some
truth
that
there
is
a
mesmeric
effect
produced
when
the
eye
is
drawn
that
blinds
one
to
the
technical
consideration
of
a
head
as
line
and
tone
in
certain
relationships
that
it
is
as
well
to
postpone
until
the
last
that
moment
when
the
shapes
and
tones
that
represent
form
in
your
drawing
shall
be
lit
up
by
the
introduction
of
the
eye
to
the
look
of
a
live
person
one
is
freer
to
consider
the
accuracy
of
one
form
before
this
disturbing
influence
is
introduced
and
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
this
although
in
point
drawing
you
can
without
serious
effect
begin
at
any
part
that
interests
you
in
setting
out
a
painting
i
think
there
can
be
no
two
opinions
as
to
the
right
way
to
go
about
it
the
character
of
the
general
disposition
of
the
masses
must
be
first
constructed
and
if
this
general
blocking
in
has
been
well
done
the
character
of
the
sitter
will
be
apparent
from
the
first
even
in
this
early
stage
and
you
will
be
able
to
judge
of
the
accuracy
of
your
blocking
out
by
whether
or
not
it
does
suggest
the
original
if
it
does
not
correct
it
before
going
any
further
working
as
it
were
from
the
general
impression
of
the
masses
of
the
head
as
seen
a
long
way
off
adding
more
and
more
detail
and
gradually
bringing
the
impression
nearer
until
the
completed
head
is
arrived
at
thus
getting
in
touch
from
the
very
first
with
the
likeness
which
should
dominate
the
work
all
along

in

the
value
of

will
depend
on
the
insight
and
distinction
of
the
author

artist

a
great
man
might
write
a
biography
of
his
master
that
could
be
quite
true
to
his
point
of
view
but
assuming
him
to
be
an
average
valet
it
would
not
be
a
great
work
i
believe
the
gardener
of
darwin
when
asked
how
his
master
was
said
not
at
all
well
you

for
five
or
ten
minutes

a
time
now
if
he
had
some
work
to
do
he
would
be
much
better
a
really
great
biography
can
not
be
written
except
by
a
man
who
can
comprehend
his
subject
and
take
a
wide
view
of
his
position
among
men
sorting
what
is
trivial
from
what
is
essential
what
is
common
to
all
men
from
what
is
particular
to
the
subject
of
his
work
and
it
is
very
much
the
same
in
portraiture
it
is
only
the
painter
who
possesses
the
intuitive
faculty
for
seizing
on
the
significant
things
in
the
form
expression
of
his
subject
of
disentangling
what
is
trivial
from
what
is
important
and
who
can
convey
this
forcibly
to
the
beholder
on
his
canvas
more
forcibly
than
a
casual
sight
of
the
real
person
could
do
it
is
only
this
painter
who
can
hope
to
paint
a
really
fine
portrait
it
is
true
the
honest
and
sincere
expression
of
any
painter
will
be
of
some
interest
just
as
the
biography
written
by
darwin
gardener
might
be
but
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
this
point
of
view
and
that
of
the
man
who
thoroughly
comprehends
his
subject
not
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
artist
to
grasp
the
mind
of
his
sitter
although
that
is
no
disadvantage
but
this
is
not
his
point
of
view
his
business
is
with
the
effect
of
this
inner
man
on
his
outward
appearance
and
it
is
necessary
for
him
to
have
that
intuitive
power
that
seizes
instinctively
on
those
variations
of
form
that
are
expressive
of
this
inner
man
the
habitual
cast
of
thought
in
any
individual
affects
the
shape
and
moulds
the
form
of
the
features
and
to
the
discerning
the
head
is
expressive
of
the
person
both
the
bigger
and
the
smaller
person
both
the
larger
and
the
petty
characteristics
everybody
possesses
and
the
fine
portrait
will
express
the
larger
and
subordinate
the
petty
individualities
will
give
you
what
is
of
value
and
subordinate
what
is
trivial
in
a
person
appearance
the
pose
of
the
head
is
a
characteristic
feature
about
people
that
is
not
always
given
enough
attention
in
portraits
the
habitual
cast
of
thought
affects
its
carriage
to
a
very
large
degree
the
two
extreme
types
of
what
we
mean
are
the
strongly
emotional
man
who
carries
his
head
high
drinking
in
impressions
as
he
goes
through
the
world
and
the
man
of
deep
thought
who
carries
his
head
bent
forward
his
back
bent
in
sympathy
with
it
everybody
has
some
characteristic
action
in
the
way
that
should
be
looked
out
for
and
that
is
usually
absent
when
a
sitter
first
appears
before
a
painter
on
the
studio
throne
a
little
diplomacy
and
conversational
humouring
is
necessary
to
produce
that
unconsciousness
that
will
betray
the
man
in
his
appearance
how
the
power
to
discover
these
things
can
be
acquired
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
teach
all
the
student
can
do
is
to
familiarise
himself
with
the
best
examples
of
portraiture
in
the
hope
that
he
may
be
stimulated
by
this
means
to
observe
finer
qualities
in
nature
and
develop
the
best
that
is
in
him
but
he
must
never
be
insincere
in
his
work
if
he
does
not
appreciate
fine
things
in
the
work
of
recognised
masters
let
him
stick
to
the
honest
portrayal
of
what
he
does
see
in
nature
the
only
distinction
of
which
he
is
capable
lies
in
this
direction
it
is
not
until
he
awakens
to
the
sight
in
nature
of
qualities
he
may
have
admired
in
others
work
that
he
is
in
a
position
honestly
to
introduce
them
into
his
own
performances
probably
the
most
popular
point
of
view
in
portraiture
at
present
is
the
one
that
can
be
described
as
a
striking
presentment
of
the
live
person
this
is
the
portrait
that
arrests
the
crowd
in
an
exhibition
you
can
not
ignore
it
vitality
bursts
from
it
and
everything
seems
sacrificed
to
this
quality
of
striking
lifelikeness
and
some
very
wonderful
modern
portraits
have
been
painted
from
this
point
of
view
but
have
we
not
sacrificed
too
much
to
this
quality
of
vitality
here
is
a
lady
hurriedly
getting
up
from
a
couch
there
a
gentleman
stepping
out
of
the
frame
to
greet
you
violence
and
vitality
everywhere
but
what
of
repose
harmony
of
colour
and
form
and
the
wise
ordering
and
selecting
of
the
materials
of
vision
that
one
has
been
used
to
in
the
great
portraiture
of
the
past
while
the
craftsman
in
one
is
staggered
and
amazed
at
the
brilliant
virtuosity
of
the
thing
the
artist
in
one
resents
the
sacrifice
of
so
much
for
what
is
after
all
but
a
excitement
age
may
no
doubt
improve
some
of
the
portraits
of
this
class
by
quieting
them
in
colour
and
tone
and
those
that
are
good
in
design
and
arrangement
will
stand
this
without
loss
of
distinction
but
those
in
which
everything
has
been
sacrificed
to
this
striking
lifelike
quality
will
suffer
considerably
this
particular
quality
depends
so
much
on
the
freshness
of
the
paint
that
when
this
is
mellowed
and
its
vividness
is
lost
nothing
will
remain
of
value
if
the
quieter
qualities
of
design
and
arrangement
have
been
sacrificed
for
it
frans
hals
is
the
only
old
master
i
can
think
of
with
whom
this
form
of
portrait
can
be
compared
but
it
will
be
noticed
that
besides
designing
his
canvases
carefully
he
usually
balanced
the
vigour
and
vitality
of
his
form
with
a
great
sobriety
of
colour
in
fact
in
some
of
his
later
work
where
this
restless
vitality
is
most
in
evidence
the
colour
is
little
more
than
black
and
white
with
a
little
yellow
ochre
and
venetian
red
it
is
this
extreme
reposefulness
of
colour
that
opposes
the
unrest
in
the
form
and
helps
to
restore
the
balance
and
necessary
repose
in
the
picture
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
restless
variety
of
the
edges
in
frans
hal
work
how
he
never
if
he
can
help
it
lets
an
edge
run
smoothly
but
keeps
it
constantly
on
the
move
often
leaving
it
quite
jagged
and
to
compare
this
with
what
was
said
about
vitality
depending
on
variety

with

another
point
of
view
is
that
of
the
artist
who
seeks
to
give
a
significant
and
calm
view
of
the
exterior
forms
of
the
sitter
an
expressive
map
of
the
individuality
of
those
forms
leaving
you
to
form
your
own
intellectual
judgments
a
simple
rather
formal
attitude
is
usually
chosen
and
the
sitter
is
drawn
with
searching
honesty
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
for
this
point
of
view
in
the
hands
of
a
painter
with
a
large
appreciation
of
form
and
design
but
without
these
more
inspiring
qualities
it
is
apt
to
have
the
dulness
that
attends
most
literal
transcriptions
there
are
many
instances
of
this
point
of
view
among
early
portrait
painters
one
of
the
best
of
which
is
the
work
of
holbein
but
then
to
a
very
distinguished
appreciation
of
the
subtleties
of
form
characterisation
he
added
a
fine
sense
of
design
and
colour
arrangement
qualities
by
no
means
always
at
the
command
of
some
of
the
lesser
men
of
this
school
every
portrait
draughtsman
should
make
a
pilgrimage
to
windsor
armed
with
the
necessary
permission
to
view
the
wonderful
series
of
portrait
drawings
by
this
master
in
the
library
of
the
castle
they
are
a
liberal
education
in
portrait
drawing
it
is
necessary
to
see
the
originals
for
it
is
only
after
having
seen
them
that
one
can
properly
understand
the
numerous
and
reproductions
a
study
of
these
drawings
will
i
think
reveal
the
fact
that
they
are
not
so
literal
as
is
usually
thought
unflinchingly
and
unaffectedly
honest
they
are
but
honest
not
to
a
cold
mechanically
accurate
record
of
the
sitter
appearance
but
honest
and
accurate
to
the
vital
impression
of
the
live
sitter
made
on
the
mind
of
the
live
artist
this
is
the
difference
we
were
trying
to
explain
that
exists
between
the
academic
and
the
vital
drawing
and
it
is
a
very
subtle
and
elusive
quality
like
all
artistic
qualities
to
talk
about
the
record
of
a
vital
impression
done
with
unflinching
accuracy
but
under
the
guidance
of
intense
mental
activity
is
a
very
different
thing
from
a
drawing
done
with
the
cold
mechanical
accuracy
of
a
machine
the
one
will
instantly
grip
the
attention
and
give
one
a
vivid
sensation
in
a
way
that
no
mechanically
accurate
drawing
could
do
and
in
a
way
that
possibly
the
sight
of
the
real
person
would
not
always
do
we
see
numbers
of
faces
during
a
day
but
only
a
few
with
the
vividness
of
which
i
am
speaking
how
many
faces
in
a
crowd
are
passed
indifferently
there
is
no
vitality
in
the
impression
they
make
on
our
mind
but
suddenly
a
face
will
rivet
our
attention
and
although
it
is
gone
in
a
flash
the
memory
of
the
impression
will
remain
for
some
time
the
best
of
holbein
portrait
drawings
give
one
the
impression
of
having
been
seen
in
one
of
these
flashes
and
rivet
the
attention
in
consequence
drawings
done
under
this
mental
stimulus
present
subtle
differences
from
drawings
done
with
cold
accuracy
the
drawing
of
the
lady
audley
here
reproduced
bears
evidence
of
some
of
this
subtle
variation
on
what
are
called
the
facts
in
the
left
eye
of
the
sitter
it
will
be
noticed
that
the
pupil
of
this
eye
is
larger
than
the
other
now
i
do
not
suppose
that
as
a
matter
of
mechanical
accuracy
this
was
so
but
the
impression
of
the
eyes
seen
as
part
of
a
vivid
impression
of
the
head
is
seldom
that
they
are
the
same
size
holbein
had
in
the
first
instance
in
this
very
carefully
wrought
drawing
made
them
so
but
when
at
the
last
he
was
vitalising
the
impression
pulling
it
together
as
artists
say
he
has
deliberately
put
a
line
outside
the
original
one
making
this
pupil
larger
this
is
not
at
all
clearly
seen
in
the
reproduction
but
is
distinctly
visible
in
the
original
and
to
my
thinking
it
was
done
at
the
dictates
of
the
vivid
mental
impression
he
wished
his
drawing
to
convey
few
can
fail
to
be
struck
in
turning
over
this
wonderful
series
of
drawings
by
the
vividness
of
their
portraiture
and
the
vividness
is
due
to
their
being
severely
accurate
to
the
vital
impression
on
the
mind
of
holbein
not
merely
to
the
facts

another
point
of
view
is
that
of
seeking
in
the
face
a
symbol
of
the
person
within
and
selecting
those
things
about
a
head
that
express
this
as
has
already
been
said
the
habitual
attitude
of
mind
has
in
the
course
of
time
a
marked
influence
on
the
form
of
the
face
and
in
fact
of
the
whole
body
so
that
to
those
who
can
see
the
man
or
woman
is
a
visible
symbol
of
themselves
but
this
is
by
no
means
apparent
to
all
the
striking
example
of
this
class
is
the
splendid
series
of
portraits
by
the
late
watts
looking
at
these
heads
one
is
made
conscious
of
the
people
in
a
fuller
deeper
sense
than
if
they
were
before
one
in
the
flesh
for
watts
sought
to
discover
the
person
in
their
appearance
and
to
paint
a
picture
that
should
be
a
living
symbol
of
them
he
took
pains
to
find
out
all
he
could
about
the
mind
of
his
sitters
before
he
painted
them
and
sought
in
the
appearance
the
expression
of
this
inner
man
so
that
whereas
with
holbein
it
was
the
vivid
presentation
of
the
impression
as
one
might
see
a
head
that
struck
one
in
a
crowd
with
watts
it
is
the
spirit
one
is
first
conscious
of
the
thunders
of
war
appear
in
the
powerful
head
of
lord
lawrence
the
music
of
poetry
in
the
head
of
swinburne
and
the
dry
atmosphere
of
the
higher
regions
of
thought
in
the
john
stuart
mill
in
the
national
portrait
gallery
there
are
two
paintings
of
the
poet
robert
browning
one
by
rudolph
lehmann
and
one
by
watts
now
the
former
portrait
is
probably
much
more
like
the
poet
as
the
people
who
met
him
casually
saw
him
but
watts
portrait
is
like
the
man
who
wrote
the
poetry
and
lehmann
is
not
browning
was
a
particularly
difficult
subject
in
this
respect
in
that
to
a
casual
observer
there
was
much
more
about
his
external
appearance
to
suggest
a
prosperous
man
of
business
than
the
fiery
zeal
of
the
poet
these
portraits
by
watts
will
repay
the
closest
study
by
the
student
of
portraiture
they
are
full
of
that
wise
selection
by
a
great
mind
that
lifts
such
work
above
the
triviality
of
the
commonplace
to
the
level
of
great
imaginative
painting
another
point
of
view
is
that
of
treating
the
sitter
as
part
of
a
symphony
of
form
and
colour
and
subordinating
everything
to
this
artistic
consideration
this
is
very
fashionable
at
the
present
time
and
much
beautiful
work
is
being
done
with
this
motive
and
with
many
ladies
who
would
not
i
hope
object
to
one
saying
that
their
principal
characteristic
was
the
charm
of
their
appearance
this
point
of
view
offers
perhaps
one
of
the
best
opportunities
of
a
successful
painting
a
pose
is
selected
that
makes
a
good
design
of
line
and
colour
a
good
pattern
and
the
character
of
the
sitter
is
not
allowed
to
obtrude
or
mar
the
symmetry
of
the
whole
considered
as
a
beautiful
panel
the
portraits
of
mcneill
whistler
are
examples
of
this
treatment
a
point
of
view
that
has
very
largely
influenced
modern
portrait
painting
in
england
then
there
is
the
official
portrait
in
which
the
dignity
of
an
office
held
by
the
sitter
of
which
occasion
the
portrait
is
a
memorial
has
to
be
considered
the
more
intimate
interest
in
the
personal
character
of
the
sitter
is
here
subordinated
to
the
interest
of
his
public
character
and
attitude
of
mind
towards
his
office
thus
it
happens
that
much
more
decorative
pageantry
symbolic
of
these
things
is
permissible
in
this
kind
of
portraiture
than
in
that
of
plain
smith
a
greater
stateliness
of
design
as
befitting
official
occasions
it
is
not
contended
that
this
forms
anything
like
a
complete
list
of
the
numerous
aspects
from
which
a
portrait
can
be
considered
but
they
are
some
of
the
more
extreme
of
those
prevalent
at
the
present
time
neither
is
it
contended
that
they
are
incompatible
with
each
other
the
qualities
of
two
or
more
of
these
points
of
view
are
often
found
in
the
same
work
and
it
is
not
inconceivable
that
a
single
portrait
might
contain
all
and
be
a
striking
lifelike
presentment
a
faithful
catalogue
of
all
the
features
a
symbol
of
the
person
and
a
symphony
of
form
and
colour
but
the
chances
are
against
such
a
composite
affair
being
a
success
one
or
other
quality
will
dominate
in
a
successful
work
and
it
is
not
advisable
to
try
and
combine
too
many
different
points
of
view
as
in
the
confusion
of
ideas
directness
of
expression
is
lost
but
no
good
portrait
is
without
some
of
the
qualities
of
all
these
points
of
view
whichever
may
dominate
the
artist
intention
sidenote
expression
the
camera
and
more
particularly
the
instantaneous
camera
has
habituated
people
to
expect
in
a
portrait
a
momentary
expression
and
of
these
momentary
expressions
the
faint
smile
as
we
all
know
is
an
easy
first
in
the
matter
of
popularity
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
for
the
painter
to
be
asked
in
the
early
stages
of
his
work
when
he
is
going
to
put
in
the
smile
it
never
being
questioned
that
this
is
the
aim
in
the
matter
of
expression
the
giving
of
lifelike
expression
to
a
painting
is
not
so
simple
a
matter
as
it
might
appear
to
be
could
one
set
the
real
person
behind
the
frame
and
suddenly
fix
them
for
ever
with
one
of
those
passing
expressions
on
their
faces
however
natural
it
might
have
been
at
the
moment
fixed
for
ever
it
is
terrible
and
most
unlifelike
as
we
have
already
said
a
few
lines
scribbled
on
a
piece
of
paper
by
a
consummate
artist
would
give
a
greater
sense
of
life
than
this
fixed
actuality
it
is
not
ultimately
by
the
pursuit
of
the
actual
realisation
that
expression
and
life
are
conveyed
in
a
portrait
every
face
has
expression
of
a
far
more
interesting
and
enduring
kind
than
these
momentary
disturbances
of
its
form
occasioned
by
laughter
or
some
passing
thought
and
it
must
never
be
forgotten
that
a
portrait
is
a
panel
painted
to
remain
for
centuries
without
movement
so
that
a
large
amount
of
the
quality
of
repose
must
enter
into
its
composition
portraits
in
which
this
has
not
been
borne
in
mind
however
entertaining
at
a
picture
exhibition
when
they
are
seen
for
a
few
moments
only
pall
on
one
if
constantly
seen
and
are
finally
very
irritating
but
the
real
expression
in
a
head
is
something
more
enduring
than
these
passing
movements
one
that
belongs
to
the
forms
of
a
head
and
the
marks
left
on
that
form
by
the
life
and
character
of
the
person
this
is
of
far
more
interest
than
those
passing
expressions
the
results
of
the
contraction
of
certain
muscles
under
the
skin
the
effect
of
which
is
very
similar
in
most
people
it
is
for
the
portrait
painter
to
find
this
more
enduring
expression
and
give
it
noble
expression
in
his
work
sidenote
treatment
of
clothes
it
is
a
common
idea
among
sitters
that
if
they
are
painted
in
modern
clothes
the
picture
will
look
in
a
few
years
if
the
sitter
appearance
were
fixed
upon
the
canvas
exactly
as
they
stood
before
the
artist
in
his
studio
without
any
selection
on
the
part
of
the
painter
this
might
be
the
result
and
the
result
in
the
case
of
painters
who
have
no
higher
aim
than
this
but
there
are
qualities
in
dress
that
do
not
belong
exclusively
to
the
particular
period
of
their
fashion
qualities
that
are
the
same
in
all
ages
and
when
these
are
insisted
upon
and
the
frivolities
of
the
moment
in
dress
not
troubled
about
so
much
the
portrait
has
a
permanent
quality
and
will
never
in
consequence
look
in
the
offensive
way
that
is
usually
meant
in
the
first
place
the
drapery
and
stuffs
of
which
clothes
are
made
follow
laws
in
the
manner
in
which
they
fold
and
drape
over
the
figure
that
are
the
same
in
all
times
if
the
expression
of
the
figure
through
the
draperies
is
sought
by
the
painter
a
permanent
quality
will
be
given
in
his
work
whatever
fantastic
shapes
the
cut
of
the
garments
may
assume
and
further
the
artist
does
not
take
whatever
comes
to
hand
in
the
appearance
of
his
sitter
but
works
to
a
arrangement
of
colour
and
form
to
a
design
this
he
selects
from
the
moving
and
varied
appearance
of
his
sitter
trying
one
thing
after
another
until
he
sees
a
suggestive
arrangement
from
the
impression
of
which
he
makes
his
design
it
is
true
that
the
extremes
of
fashion
do
not
always
lend
themselves
so
readily
as
more
reasonable
modes
to
the
making
of
a
good
pictorial
pattern
but
this
is
not
always
so
some
extreme
fashions
giving
opportunities
of
very
piquant
and
interesting
portrait
designs
so
that
however
extreme
the
fashion
if
the
artist
is
able
to
select
some
aspect
of
it
that
will
result
in
a
good
arrangement
for
his
portrait
the
work
will
never
have
the
offensive
look
the
principles
governing
good
designs
are
the
same
in
all
times
and
if
material
for
such
arrangement
has
been
discovered
in
the
most
modish
of
fashions
it
has
been
lifted
into
a
sphere
where
nothing
is
ever
out
of
date
it
is
only
when
the
painter
is
concerned
with
the
trivial
details
of
fashion
for
their
own
sake
for
the
making
his
picture
look
like
the
real
thing
and
has
not
been
concerned
with
transmuting
the
appearance
of
fashionable
clothes
by
selection
into
the
permanent
realms
of
form
and
colour
design
that
his
work
will
justify
one
in
saying
that
it
will
look
stale
in
a
few
years
the
fashion
of
dressing
sitters
in
meaningless
classical
draperies
is
a
feeble
one
and
usually
argues
a
lack
of
capacity
for
selecting
a
good
arrangement
from
the
clothes
of
the
period
in
the
artist
who
adopts
it
modern
women
clothes
are
full
of
suggestions
for
new
arrangements
and
designs
quite
as
good
as
anything
that
has
been
done
in
the
past
the
range
of
subtle
colours
and
varieties
of
texture
in
materials
is
amazing
and
the
subtlety
of
invention
displayed
in
some
of
the
designs
for
costumes
leads
one
to
wonder
whether
there
is
not
something
in
the
remark
attributed
to
an
eminent
sculptor
that
designing
ladies
fashions
is
one
of
the
few
arts
that
is
thoroughly
vital
xviii
the
visual
memory
the
memory
is
the
great
storehouse
of
artistic
material
the
treasures
of
which
the
artist
may
know
little
about
until
a
chance
association
lights
up
some
of
its
dark
recesses
from
early
years
the
mind
of
the
young
artist
has
been
storing
up
impressions
in
these
mysterious
chambers
collected
from
nature
aspects
works
of
art
and
anything
that
comes
within
the
field
of
vision
it
is
from
this
store
that
the
imagination
draws
its
material
however
fantastic
and
remote
from
natural
appearances
the
forms
it
may
assume
how
much
our
memory
of
pictures
colours
the
impressions
of
nature
we
receive
is
probably
not
suspected
by
us
but
who
could
say
how
a
scene
would
appear
to
him
had
he
never
looked
at
a
picture
so
sensitive
is
the
vision
to
the
influence
of
memory
that
after
seeing
the
pictures
of
some
painter
whose
work
has
deeply
impressed
us
we
are
apt
while
the
memory
of
it
is
still
fresh
in
our
minds
to
see
things
as
he
would
paint
them
on
different
occasions
after
leaving
the
national
gallery
i
can
remember
having
seen
trafalgar
square
as
paolo
veronese
turner
or
whatever
painter
may
have
impressed
me
in
the
gallery
would
have
painted
it
the
memory
of
their
work
colouring
the
impression
the
scene
produced
but
putting
aside
the
memory
of
pictures
let
us
consider
the
place
of
direct
visual
memory
from
nature
in
our
work
pictures
being
indirect
or
impressions
we
have
seen
in
an
earlier
chapter
how
certain
painters
in
the
nineteenth
century
feeling
how
very
and
far
removed
from
nature
painting
had
become
started
a
movement
to
discard
studio
traditions
and
study
nature
with
a
single
eye
taking
their
pictures
out
of
doors
and
endeavouring
to
wrest
nature
secrets
from
her
on
the
spot
the
movement
in
england
and
the
impressionist
movement
in
france
were
the
results
of
this
impulse
and
it
is
interesting
by
the
way
to
contrast
the
different
manner
in
which
this
desire
for
more
truth
to
nature
affected
the
french
and
english
temperaments
the
intense
individualism
of
the
english
sought
out
every
detail
every
leaf
and
flower
for
itself
painting
them
with
a
passion
and
intensity
that
made
their
painting
a
vivid
medium
for
the
expression
of
poetic
ideas
while
the
more
synthetic
mind
of
the
frenchman
approached
this
search
for
visual
truth
from
the
opposite
point
of
view
of
the
whole
effect
finding
in
the
large
generalised
impression
a
new
world
of
beauty
and
his
more
logical
mind
led
him
to
inquire
into
the
nature
of
light
and
so
to
invent
a
technique
founded
on
scientific
principles
but
now
the
first
blush
of
freshness
has
worn
off
the
new
movement
painters
have
begun
to
see
that
if
anything
but
very
ordinary
effects
are
to
be
attempted
this
painting
on
the
spot
must
give
place
to
more
reliance
on
the
memory
memory
has
this
great
advantage
over
direct
vision
it
retains
more
vividly
the
essential
things
and
has
a
habit
of
losing
what
is
unessential
to
the
pictorial
impression
but
what
is
the
essential
in
a
painting
what
is
it
makes
one
want
to
paint
at
all
ah
here
we
approach
very
debatable
and
shadowy
ground
and
we
can
do
little
but
ask
questions
the
answer
to
which
will
vary
with
each
individual
temperament
what
is
it
that
these
rays
of
light
striking
our
retina
convey
to
our
brain
and
from
our
brain
to
whatever
is
ourselves
in
the
seat
of
consciousness
above
this
what
is
this
mysterious
correspondence
set
up
between
something
within
and
something
without
that
at
times
sends
such
a
clamour
of
harmony
through
our
whole
being
why
do
certain
combinations
of
sound
in
music
and
of
form
and
colour
in
art
affect
us
so
profoundly
what
are
the
laws
governing
harmony
in
the
universe
and
whence
do
they
come
it
is
hardly
trees
and
sky
earth
or
flesh
and
blood
as
such
that
interest
the
artist
but
rather
that
through
these
things
in
memorable
moments
he
is
permitted
a
consciousness
of
deeper
things
and
impelled
to
seek
utterance
for
what
is
moving
him
it
is
the
record
of
these
rare
moments
in
which
one
apprehends
truth
in
things
seen
that
the
artist
wishes
to
convey
to
others
but
these
moments
these
flashes
of
inspiration
which
are
at
the
inception
of
every
vital
picture
occur
but
seldom
what
the
painter
has
to
do
is
to
fix
them
vividly
in
his
memory
to
snapshot
them
as
it
were
so
that
they
may
stand
by
him
during
the
toilsome
procedure
of
the
painting
and
guide
the
work
this
initial
inspiration
this
initial
flash
in
the
mind
need
not
be
the
result
of
a
scene
in
nature
but
may
of
course
be
purely
the
work
of
the
imagination
a
composition
the
sense
of
which
flashes
across
the
mind
but
in
either
case
the
difficulty
is
to
preserve
vividly
the
sensation
of
this
original
artistic
impulse
and
in
the
case
of
its
having
been
derived
from
nature
direct
as
is
so
often
the
case
in
modern
art
the
system
of
painting
continually
on
the
spot
is
apt
to
lose
touch
with
it
very
soon
for
in
the
continual
observation
of
anything
you
have
set
your
easel
before
day
after
day
comes
a
series
of
impressions
more
and
more
commonplace
as
the
eye
becomes
more
and
more
familiar
with
the
details
of
the
subject
and
ere
long
the
original
emotion
that
was
the
reason
of
the
whole
work
is
lost
sight
of
and
one
of
those
pictures
or
drawings
giving
a
catalogue
of
tired
objects
more
or
less
ingeniously
arranged
that
we
all
know
so
well
is
the
result
work
utterly
lacking
in
the
freshness
and
charm
of
true
inspiration
for
however
commonplace
the
subject
seen
by
the
artist
in
one
of
his
flashes
it
is
clothed
in
a
newness
and
surprise
that
charm
us
be
it
only
an
orange
on
a
plate
now
a
picture
is
a
thing
of
paint
upon
a
flat
surface
and
a
drawing
is
a
matter
of
certain
marks
upon
a
paper
and
how
to
translate
the
intricacies
of
a
visual
or
imagined
impression
to
the
prosaic
terms
of
masses
of
coloured
pigment
or
lines
and
tones
is
the
business
with
which
our
technique
is
concerned
the
ease
therefore
with
which
a
painter
will
be
able
to
remember
an
impression
in
a
form
from
which
he
can
work
will
depend
upon
his
power
to
analyse
vision
in
this
technical
sense
the
more
one
knows
about
what
may
be
called
the
anatomy
of
how
certain
forms
produce
certain
effects
certain
colours
or
arrangements
other
effects
the
easier
will
it
be
for
him
to
carry
away
a
visual
memory
of
his
subject
that
will
stand
by
him
during
the
long
hours
of
his
labours
at
the
picture
the
more
he
knows
of
the
expressive
powers
of
lines
and
tones
the
more
easily
will
he
be
able
to
observe
the
vital
things
in
nature
that
convey
the
impression
he
wishes
to
memorise
it
is
not
enough
to
drink
in
and
remember
the
emotional
side
of
the
matter
although
this
must
be
done
fully
but
if
a
memory
of
the
subject
is
to
be
carried
away
that
will
be
of
service
technically
the
scene
must
be
committed
to
memory
in
terms
of
whatever
medium
you
intend
to
employ
for
reproducing
it
in
the
case
of
a
drawing
lines
and
tones
and
the
impression
will
have
to
be
analysed
into
these
terms
as
if
you
were
actually
drawing
the
scene
on
some
imagined
piece
of
paper
in
your
mind
the
faculty
of
doing
this
is
not
to
be
acquired
all
at
once
but
it
is
amazing
of
how
much
development
it
is
capable
just
as
the
faculty
of
committing
to
memory
long
poems
or
plays
can
be
developed
so
can
the
faculty
of
remembering
visual
things
this
subject
has
received
little
attention
in
art
schools
until
just
recently
but
it
is
not
yet
so
systematically
done
as
it
might
be
monsieur
lecoq
de
boisbaudran
in
france
experimented
with
pupils
in
this
memory
training
beginning
with
very
simple
things
like
the
outline
of
a
nose
and
going
on
to
more
complex
subjects
by
easy
stages
with
the
most
surprising
results
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
great
deal
more
can
and
should
be
done
in
this
direction
than
is
at
present
attempted
what
students
should
do
is
to
form
a
habit
of
making
every
day
in
their
a
drawing
of
something
they
have
seen
that
has
interested
them
and
that
they
have
made
some
attempt
at
memorising
do
be
discouraged
if
the
results
are
poor
and
disappointing
at
first
you
will
find
that
by
persevering
your
power
of
memory
will
develop
and
be
of
the
greatest
service
to
you
in
your
after
work
try
particularly
to
remember
the
spirit
of
the
subject
and
in
this
some
scribbling
and
fumbling
will
necessarily
have
to
be
done
you
can
not
expect
to
be
able
to
draw
definitely
and
clearly
from
memory
at
least
at
first
although
your
aim
should
always
be
to
draw
as
frankly
and
clearly
as
you
can
illustration
plate
liv
study
on
brown
paper
in
black
and
white

chalk
illustrating
a
simple
method
of
studying
drapery
forms
let
us
assume
that
you
have
found
a
subject
that
moves
you
and
that
being
too
fleeting
to
draw
on
the
spot
you
wish
to
commit
to
memory
drink
a
full
enjoyment
of
it
let
it
soak
in
for
the
recollection
of
this
will
be
of
the
utmost
use
to
you
afterwards
in
guiding
your
this
mental
impression
is
not
difficult
to
recall
it
is
the
visual
impression
in
terms
of
line
and
tone
that
is
difficult
to
remember
having
experienced
your
full
enjoyment
of
the
artistic
matter
in
the
subject
you
must
next
consider
it
from
the
material
side
as
a
flat
visual
impression
as
this
is
the
only
form
in
which
it
can
be
expressed
on
a
flat
sheet
of
paper
note
the
proportions
of
the
main
lines
their
shapes
and
disposition
as
if
you
were
drawing
it
in
fact
do
the
whole
drawing
in
your
mind
memorising
the
forms
and
proportions
of
the
different
parts
and
fix
it
in
your
memory
to
the
smallest
detail
if
only
the
emotional
side
of
the
matter
has
been
remembered
when
you
come
to
draw
it
you
will
be
hopelessly
at
sea
as
it
is
remarkable
how
little
the
memory
retains
of
the
appearance
of
things
constantly
seen
if
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
memorise
their
visual
appearance
the
true
artist
even
when
working
from
nature
works
from
memory
very
largely
that
is
to
say
he
works
to
a
scheme
in
tune
to
some
emotional
enthusiasm
with
which
the
subject
has
inspired
him
in
the
first
instance
nature
is
always
changing
but
he
does
not
change
the
intention
of
his
picture
he
always
keeps
before
him
the
initial
impression
he
sets
out
to
paint
and
only
selects
from
nature
those
things
that
play
up
to
it
he
is
a
feeble
artist
who
copies
individually
the
parts
of
a
scene
with
whatever
effect
they
may
have
at
the
moment
he
is
doing
them
and
then
expects
the
sum
total
to
make
a
picture
if
circumstances
permit
it
is
always
as
well
to
make
in
the
first
instance
a
rapid
sketch
that
shall
whatever
it
may
lack
at
least
contain
the
main
disposition
of
the
masses
and
lines
of
your
composition
seen
under
the
influence
of
the
enthusiasm
that
has
inspired
the
work
this
will
be
of
great
value
afterwards
in
freshening
your
memory
when
in
the
labour
of
the
work
the
original
impulse
gets
dulled
it
is
seldom
that
the
vitality
of
this
first
sketch
is
surpassed
by
the
completed
work
and
often
alas
it
is
far
from
equalled
in
portrait
painting
and
drawing
the
memory
must
be
used
also
a
sitter
varies
very
much
in
the
impression
he
gives
on
different
days
and
the
artist
must
in
the
early
sittings
when
his
mind
is
fresh
select
the
aspect
he
means
to
paint
and
afterwards
work
largely
to
the
memory
of
this
always
work
to
a
scheme
on
which
you
have
decided
and
do
not
flounder
on
in
the
hope
of
something
turning
up
as
you
go
along
your
faculties
are
never
so
active
and
prone
to
see
something
interesting
and
fine
as
when
the
subject
is
first
presented
to
them
this
is
the
time
to
decide
your
scheme
this
is
the
time
to
take
your
fill
of
the
impression
you
mean
to
convey
this
is
the
time
to
learn
your
subject
thoroughly
and
decide
on
what
you
wish
the
picture
to
be
and
having
decided
this
work
straight
on
using
nature
to
support
your
original
impression
but
be
led
off
by
a
fresh
scheme
because
others
strike
you
as
you
go
along
new
schemes
will
do
so
of
course
and
every
new
one
has
a
knack
of
looking
better
than
your
original
one
but
it
is
not
often
that
this
is
so
the
fact
that
they
are
new
makes
them
appear
to
greater
advantage
than
the
original
scheme
to
which
you
have
got
accustomed
so
that
it
is
not
only
in
working
away
from
nature
that
the
memory
is
of
use
but
actually
when
working
directly
in
front
of
nature
to
sum
up
there
are
two
aspects
of
a
subject
the
one
luxuriating
in
the
sensuous
pleasure
of
it
with
all
of
spiritual
significance
it
may
consciously
or
unconsciously
convey
and
the
other
concerned
with
the
lines
tones
shapes
and
their
rhythmic
ordering
by
means
of
which
it
is
to
be
expressed
the
matter
and
manner
as
they
may
be
called
and
if
the
artist
memory
is
to
be
of
use
to
him
in
his
work
both
these
aspects
must
be
memorised
and
of
the
two
the
second
will
need
the
most
attention
but
although
there
are
these
two
aspects
of
the
subject
and
each
must
receive
separate
attention
when
memorising
it
they
are
in
reality
only
two
aspects
of
the
same
thing
which
in
the
act
of
painting
or
drawing
must
be
united
if
a
work
of
art
is
to
result
when
a
subject
first
flashes
upon
an
artist
he
delights
in
it
as
a
painted
or
drawn
thing
and
feels
instinctively
the
treatment
it
will
require
in
good
draughtsmanship
the
thing
felt
will
guide
and
govern
everything
every
touch
will
be
instinct
with
the
thrill
of
that
first
impression
the
craftsman
mind
so
laboriously
built
up
should
by
now
have
become
an
instinct
a
second
nature
at
the
direction
of
a
higher
consciousness
at
such
times
the
right
strokes
the
right
tones
come
naturally
and
go
on
the
right
place
the
artist
being
only
conscious
of
a
fierce
joy
and
a
feeling
that
things
are
in
tune
and
going
well
for
once
it
is
the
thirst
for
this
glorious
enthusiasm
this
fusing
of
matter
and
manner
this
act
of
giving
the
spirit
within
outward
form
that
spurs
the
artist
on
at
all
times
and
it
is
this
that
is
the
wonderful
thing
about
art
xix
procedure
in
commencing
a
drawing
do
as
so
many
students
do
start
carelessly
floundering
about
with
your
chalk
or
charcoal
in
the
hope
that
something
will
turn
up
it
is
seldom
if
ever
that
an
artist
puts
on
paper
anything
better
than
he
has
in
his
mind
before
he
starts
and
usually
it
is
not
nearly
so
good
do
spoil
the
beauty
of
a
clean
sheet
of
paper
by
a
lot
of
scribble
try
and
see
in
your
mind
eye
the
drawing
you
mean
to
do
and
then
try
and
make
your
hand
realise
it
making
the
paper
more
beautiful
by
every
touch
you
give
instead
of
spoiling
it
by
a
slovenly
manner
of
procedure
to
know
what
you
want
to
do
and
then
to
do
it
is
the
secret
of
good
style
and
technique
this
sounds
very
commonplace
but
it
is
surprising
how
few
students
make
it
their
aim
you
may
often
observe
them
come
in
pin
a
piece
of
paper
on
their
board
draw
a
line
down
the
middle
make
a
few
measurements
and
start
blocking
in
the
drawing
without
having
given
the
subject
to
be
drawn
a
thought
as
if
it
were
all
there
done
before
them
and
only
needed
copying
as
a
clerk
would
copy
a
letter
already
drafted
for
him
now
nothing
is
being
said
against
the
practice
of
drawing
guide
lines
and
taking
measurements
and
blocking
in
your
work
this
is
very
necessary
in
academic
work
if
rather
fettering
to
expressive
drawing
but
even
in
the
most
academic
drawing
the
artistic
intelligence
must
be
used
although
that
is
not
the
kind
of
drawing
this
chapter
is
particularly
referring
to
look
well
at
the
model
first
try
and
be
moved
by
something
in
the
form
that
you
feel
is
fine
or
interesting
and
try
and
see
in
your
mind
eye
what
sort
of
drawing
you
mean
to
do
before
touching
your
paper
in
school
studies
be
always
unflinchingly
honest
to
the
impression
the
model
gives
you
but
dismiss
the
camera
idea
of
truth
from
your
mind
instead
of
converting
yourself
into
a
mechanical
instrument
for
the
copying
of
what
is
before
you
let
your
drawing
be
an
expression
of
truth
perceived
intelligently
be
extremely
careful
about
the
first
few
strokes
you
put
on
your
paper
the
quality
of
your
drawing
is
often
decided
in
these
early
stages
if
they
are
vital
and
expressive
you
have
started
along
lines
you
can
develop
and
have
some
hope
of
doing
a
good
drawing
if
they
are
feeble
and
poor
the
chances
are
greatly
against
your
getting
anything
good
built
upon
them
if
your
start
has
been
bad
pull
yourself
together
turn
your
paper
over
and
start
afresh
trying
to
seize
upon
the
big
significant
lines
and
swings
in
your
subject
at
once
remember
it
is
much
easier
to
put
down
a
statement
correctly
than
to
correct
a
wrong
one
so
out
with
the
whole
part
if
you
are
convinced
it
is
wrong
train
yourself
to
make
direct
accurate
statements
in
your
drawings
and
waste
time
trying
to
manoeuvre
a
bad
drawing
into
a
good
one
stop
as
soon
as
you
feel
you
have
gone
wrong
and
correct
the
work
in
its
early
stages
instead
of
rushing
on
upon
a
wrong
foundation
in
the
vague
hope
that
it
will
all
come
right
in
the
end
when
out
walking
if
you
find
you
have
taken
a
wrong
road
you
do
not
if
you
are
wise
go
on
in
the
hope
that
the
wrong
way
will
lead
to
the
right
one
but
you
turn
round
and
go
back
to
the
point
at
which
you
left
the
right
road
it
is
very
much
the
same
in
drawing
and
painting
as
soon
as
you
become
aware
that
you
have
got
upon
the
wrong
track
stop
and
rub
out
your
work
until
an
earlier
stage
that
was
right
is
reached
and
start
along
again
from
this
point
as
your
eye
gets
trained
you
will
more
quickly
perceive
when
you
have
done
a
wrong
stroke
and
be
able
to
correct
it
before
having
gone
very
far
along
the
wrong
road
do
not
work
too
long
without
giving
your
eye
a
little
rest
a
few
moments
will
be
quite
sufficient
if
things
wo
come
stop
a
minute
the
eye
often
gets
fatigued
very
quickly
and
refuses
to
see
truly
but
soon
revives
if
rested
a
minute
or
two
do
not
go
labouring
at
a
drawing
when
your
mind
is
not
working
you
are
not
doing
any
good
and
probably
are
spoiling
any
good
you
have
already
done
pull
yourself
together
and
ask
what
it
is
you
are
trying
to
express
and
having
got
this
idea
firmly
fixed
in
your
mind
go
for
your
drawing
with
the
determination
that
it
shall
express
it
all
this
will
sound
very
trite
to
students
of
any
mettle
but
there
are
large
numbers
who
waste
no
end
of
time
working
in
a
purely
mechanical
lifeless
way
and
with
their
minds
anywhere
but
concentrated
upon
the
work
before
them
and
if
the
mind
is
not
working
the
work
of
the
hand
will
be
of
no
account
my
own
experience
is
that
one
has
constantly
to
be
making
fresh
effort
during
the
procedure
of
the
work
the
mind
is
apt
to
tire
and
needs
rousing
continually
otherwise
the
work
will
lack
the
impulse
that
shall
make
it
vital
particularly
is
this
so
in
the
final
stages
of
a
drawing
or
painting
when
in
adding
details
and
small
refinements
it
is
doubly
necessary
for
the
mind
to
be
on
fire
with
the
initial
impulse
or
the
main
qualities
will
be
obscured
and
the
result
enfeebled
by
these
smaller
matters
do
not
rub
out
if
you
can
possibly
help
it
in
drawings
that
aim
at
artistic
expression
in
academic
work
where
artistic
feeling
is
less
important
than
the
discipline
of
your
faculties
you
may
of
course
do
so
but
even
here
as
little
as
possible
in
beautiful
drawing
of
any
facility
it
has
a
weakening
effect
somewhat
similar
to
that
produced
by
a
person
stopping
in
the
middle
of
a
witty
or
brilliant
remark
to
correct
a
word
if
a
wrong
line
is
made
it
is
left
in
by
the
side
of
the
right
one
in
the
drawing
of
many
of
the
masters
but
the
great
aim
of
the
draughtsman
should
be
to
train
himself
to
draw
cleanly
and
fearlessly
hand
and
eye
going
together
but
this
state
of
things
can
not
be
expected
for
some
time
let
painstaking
accuracy
be
your
aim
for
a
long
time
when
your
eye
and
hand
have
acquired
the
power
of
seeing
and
expressing
on
paper
with
some
degree
of
accuracy
what
you
see
you
will
find
facility
and
quickness
of
execution
will
come
of
their
own
accord
in
drawing
of
any
expressive
power
this
quickness
and
facility
of
execution
are
absolutely
essential
the
waves
of
emotion
under
the
influence
of
which
the
eye
really
sees
in
any
artistic
sense
do
not
last
long
enough
to
allow
of
a
slow
painstaking
manner
of
execution
there
must
be
no
hitch
in
the
machinery
of
expression
when
the
consciousness
is
alive
to
the
realisation
of
something
fine
fluency
of
hand
and
accuracy
of
eye
are
the
things
your
academic
studies
should
have
taught
you
and
these
powers
will
be
needed
if
you
are
to
catch
the
expression
of
any
of
the
finer
things
in
form
that
constitute
good
drawing
try
and
express
yourself
in
as
simple
not
as
complicated
a
manner
as
possible
let
every
touch
mean
something
and
if
you
do
see
what
to
do
next
do
fill
in
the
time
by
meaningless
shading
and
scribbling
until
you
do
wait
awhile
rest
your
eye
by
looking
away
and
then
see
if
you
can
not
find
something
right
that
needs
doing
before
beginning
a
drawing
it
is
not
a
bad
idea
to
study
carefully
the
work
of
some
master
draughtsman
whom
the
subject
to
be
drawn
may
suggest
if
you
do
this
carefully
and
thoughtfully
and
take
in
a
full
enjoyment
your
eye
will
unconsciously
be
led
to
see
in
nature
some
of
the
qualities
of
the
master
work
and
you
will
see
the
subject
to
be
drawn
as
a
much
finer
thing
than
would
have
been
the
case
had
you
come
to
it
with
your
eye
unprepared
in
any
way
reproductions
are
now
so
good
and
cheap
that
the
best
drawings
in
the
world
can
be
had
for
a
few
pence
and
every
student
should
begin
collecting
reproductions
of
the
things
that
interest
him
this
is
not
the
place
to
discuss
questions
of
health
but
perhaps
it
will
not
be
thought
grandmotherly
to
mention
the
extreme
importance
of
nervous
vitality
in
a
fine
draughtsman
and
how
his
life
should
be
ordered
on
such
healthy
lines
that
he
has
at
his
command
the
maximum
instead
of
the
minimum
of
this
faculty
after
a
certain
point
it
is
a
question
of
vitality
how
far
an
artist
is
likely
to
go
in
art
given
two
men
of
equal
ability
the
one
leading
a
careless
life
and
the
other
a
healthy
one
as
far
as
a
healthy
one
is
possible
to
such
a
supersensitive
creature
as
an
artist
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
result
it
is
because
there
is
still
a
lingering
idea
in
the
minds
of
many
that
an
artist
must
lead
a
dissipated
life
or
he
is
not
really
an
artist
that
one
feels
it
necessary
to
mention
the
subject
this
idea
has
evidently
arisen
from
the
inability
of
the
average
person
to
associate
an
unconventional
mode
of
life
with
anything
but
riotous
dissipation
a
conventional
life
is
not
the
only
wholesome
form
of
existence
and
is
certainly
a
most
unwholesome
and
deadening
form
to
the
artist
and
neither
is
a
dissipated
life
the
only
unconventional
one
open
to
him
it
is
as
well
that
the
young
student
should
know
this
and
be
led
early
to
take
great
care
of
that
most
valuable
of
studio
properties
vigorous
health
xx
materials
the
materials
in
which
the
artist
works
are
of
the
greatest
importance
in
determining
what
qualities
in
the
infinite
complexity
of
nature
he
selects
for
expression
and
the
good
draughtsman
will
find
out
the
particular
ones
that
belong
to
whatever
medium
he
selects
for
his
drawing
and
be
careful
never
to
attempt
more
than
it
is
capable
of
doing
every
material
he
works
with
possesses
certain
vital
qualities
peculiar
to
itself
and
it
is
his
business
to
find
out
what
these
are
and
use
them
to
the
advantage
of
his
drawing
when
one
is
working
with
say
pen
and
ink
the
necessity
for
selecting
only
certain
things
is
obvious
enough
but
when
a
medium
with
the
vast
capacity
of
oil
paint
is
being
used
the
principle
of
its
governing
the
nature
of
the
work
is
more
often
lost
sight
of
so
near
can
oil
paint
approach
an
actual
illusion
of
natural
appearances
that
much
misdirected
effort
has
been
wasted
on
this
object
all
enjoyment
of
the
medium
being
subordinated
to
a
meretricious
attempt
to
deceive
the
eye
and
i
believe
a
popular
idea
of
the
art
of
painting
is
that
it
exists
chiefly
to
produce
this
deception
no
vital
expression
of
nature
can
be
achieved
without
the
aid
of
the
particular
vitality
possessed
by
the
medium
with
which
one
is
working
if
this
is
lost
sight
of
and
the
eye
is
tricked
into
thinking
that
it
is
looking
at
real
nature
it
is
not
a
fine
picture
art
is
not
a
substitute
for
nature
but
an
expression
of
feeling
produced
in
the
consciousness
of
the
artist
and
intimately
associated
with
the
material
through
which
it
is
expressed
in
his
work
inspired
it
may
be
in
the
first
instance
by
something
seen
and
expressed
by
him
in
painted
symbols
as
true
to
nature
as
he
can
make
them
while
keeping
in
tune
to
the
emotional
idea
that
prompted
the
work
but
never
regarded
by
the
fine
artist
as
anything
but
painted
symbols
nevertheless
never
for
one
moment
does
he
intend
you
to
forget
that
it
is
a
painted
picture
you
are
looking
at
however
naturalistic
the
treatment
his
theme
may
demand
in
the
earlier
history
of
art
it
was
not
so
necessary
to
insist
on
the
limitations
imposed
by
different
mediums
with
their
more
limited
knowledge
of
the
phenomena
of
vision
the
early
masters
had
not
the
same
opportunities
of
going
astray
in
this
respect
but
now
that
the
whole
field
of
vision
has
been
discovered
and
that
the
subtlest
effects
of
light
and
atmosphere
are
capable
of
being
represented
it
has
become
necessary
to
decide
how
far
complete
accuracy
of
representation
will
help
the
particular
impression
you
may
intend
your
picture
or
drawing
to
create
the
danger
is
that
in
producing
a
complete
illusion
of
representation
the
particular
vitality
of
your
medium
with
all
the
expressive
power
it
is
capable
of
yielding
may
be
lost
perhaps
the
chief
difference
between
the
great
masters
of
the
past
and
many
modern
painters
is
the
neglect
of
this
principle
they
represented
nature
in
terms
of
whatever
medium
they
worked
in
and
never
overstepped
this
limitation
modern
artists
particularly
in
the
nineteenth
century
often
attempted
to
copy
nature
the
medium
being
subordinated
to
the
attempt
to
make
it
look
like
the
real
thing
in
the
same
way
the
drawings
of
the
great
masters
were
drawings
they
did
not
attempt
anything
with
a
point
that
a
point
was
not
capable
of
expressing
the
drawings
of
many
modern
artists
are
full
of
attempts
to
express
tone
and
colour
effects
things
entirely
outside
the
true
province
of
drawing
the
small
but
infinitely
important
part
of
nature
that
pure
drawing
is
capable
of
conveying
has
been
neglected
and
line
work
until
recently
went
out
of
fashion
in
our
schools
there
is
something
that
makes
for
power
in
the
limitations
your
materials
impose
many
artists
whose
work
in
some
of
the
more
limited
mediums
is
fine
are
utterly
feeble
when
they
attempt
one
with
so
few
restrictions
as
oil
paint
if
students
could
only
be
induced
to
impose
more
restraint
upon
themselves
when
they
attempt
so
difficult
a
medium
as
paint
it
would
be
greatly
to
the
advantage
of
their
work
beginning
first
with
monochrome
in
three
tones
as
explained
in
a
former
chapter
they
might
then
take
for
figure
work
ivory
black
and
venetian
red
it
is
surprising
what
an
amount
of
colour
effect
can
be
got
with
this
simple
means
and
how
much
can
be
learned
about
the
relative
positions
of
the
warm
and
cold
colours
do
not
attempt
the
full
range
of
tone
at
first
but
keep
the
darks
rather
lighter
and
the
lights
darker
than
nature
attempt
the
full
scale
of
tone
only
when
you
have
acquired
sufficient
experience
with
the
simpler
range
and
gradually
add
more
colours
as
you
learn
to
master
a
few
but
restraints
are
not
so
fashionable
just
now
as
unbridled
licence
art
students
start
in
with
a
palette
full
of
the
most
amazing
colours
producing
results
that
it
were
better
not
to
discuss
it
is
a
wise
man
who
can
discover
his
limitations
and
select
a
medium
the
capacities
of
which
just
tally
with
his
own
to
discover
this
it
is
advisable
to
try
many
and
below
is
a
short
description
of
the
chief
ones
used
by
the
draughtsman
but
very
little
can
be
said
about
them
and
very
little
idea
of
their
capacities
given
in
a
written
description
they
must
be
handled
by
the
student
and
are
no
doubt
capable
of
many
more
qualities
than
have
yet
been
got
out
of
them
sidenote
lead
pencil
this
medium
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
for
pure
line
work
and
its
use
is
an
excellent
training
to
the
eye
and
hand
in
precision
of
observation
perhaps
this
is
why
it
has
not
been
so
popular
in
our
art
schools
lately
when
the
charms
of
severe
discipline
are
not
so
much
in
favour
as
they
should
be
it
is
the
first
medium
we
are
given
to
draw
with
and
as
the
handiest
and
most
convenient
is
unrivalled
for
use
it
is
made
in
a
large
variety
of
degrees
from
the
hardest
and
greyest
to
the
softest
and
blackest
and
is
too
well
known
to
need
much
description
it
does
not
need
fixing
for
pure
line
drawing
nothing
equals
it
except
silver
point
and
great
draughtsmen
like
ingres
have
always
loved
it
it
does
not
lend
itself
so
readily
to
any
form
of
mass
drawing
although
it
is
sometimes
used
for
this
purpose
the
offensive
shine
that
occurs
if
dark
masses
are
introduced
is
against
its
use
in
any
but
very
lightly
shaded
work
illustration
plate
lv
from
a
drawing
its
charm
is
the
extreme
delicacy
of
its
lines
sidenote
silver
and
gold
point
similar
to
lead
pencil
and
of
even
greater
delicacy
is
drawing
a
more
ancient
method
it
consists
in
drawing
with
a
silver
point
on
paper
the
surface
of
which
has
been
treated
with
a
faint
wash
of
chinese
white
without
this
wash
the
point
will
not
make
a
mark
for
extreme
delicacy
and
purity
of
line
no
medium
can
surpass
this
method
and
for
the
expression
of
a
beautiful
line
such
as
a
profile
nothing
could
be
more
suitable
than
a
silver
point
as
a
training
to
the
eye
and
hand
also
it
is
of
great
value
as
no
rubbing
out
of
any
sort
is
possible
and
eye
and
hand
must
work
together
with
great
exactness
the
discipline
of
drawing
is
to
be
recommended
as
a
corrective
to
the
picturesque
vagaries
of
charcoal
work
a
gold
point
giving
a
warmer
line
can
also
be
used
in
the
same
way
as
a
silver
point
the
paper
first
having
been
treated
with
chinese
white
sidenote
charcoal
two
extreme
points
of
view
from
which
the
rendering
of
form
can
be
approached
have
been
explained
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
students
should
study
them
both
separately
in
the
first
instance
as
they
each
have
different
things
to
teach
of
the
mediums
that
are
best
suited
to
a
drawing
combining
both
points
of

the
first
and

popular
is
charcoal
charcoal
is
made
in
many
different
degrees
of
hardness
and
softness
the
harder
varieties
being
capable
of
quite
a
fine
point
a
point
is
the
most
convenient
as
it
does
not
wear
away
so
quickly
and
if
the
broad
side
of
the
chisel
point
is
used
when
a
dark
mass
is
wanted
the
edge
can
constantly
be
kept
sharp
with
this
edge
a
very
fine
line
can
be
drawn
charcoal
works
with
great
freedom
and
answers
readily
when
forceful
expression
is
wanted
it
is
much
more
like
painting
than
any
other
form
of
drawing
a
wide
piece
of
charcoal
making
a
wide
mark
similar
to
a
brush
the
delicacy
and
lightness
with
which
it
has
to
be
handled
is
also
much
more
like
the
handling
of
a
brush
than
any
other
point
drawing
when
rubbed
with
the
finger
it
sheds
a
soft
grey
tone
over
the
whole
work
with
a
piece
of
bread
pressed
by
thumb
and
finger
into
a
pellet
high
lights
can
be
taken
out
with
the
precision
of
white
chalk
or
rubber
can
be
used
bread
is
perhaps
the
best
as
it
does
not
smudge
the
charcoal
but
lifts
it
readily
off
when
rubbed
with
the
finger
the
darks
of
course
are
lightened
in
tone
it
is
therefore
useful
to
draw
in
the
general
proportions
roughly
and
rub
down
in
this
way
you
then
have
a
middle
tone
over
the
work
with
the
rough
drawing
showing
through
now
proceed
carefully
to
draw
your
lights
with
bread
or
rubber
and
your
shadows
with
charcoal
in
much
the
same
manner
as
you
did
in
the
monochrome
exercises
already
described
all
preliminary
setting
out
of
your
work
on
canvas
is
usually
done
with
charcoal
which
must
of
course
be
fixed
with
a
spray
diffuser
for
large
work
such
as
a
portrait
sticks
of
charcoal
nearly
an
inch
in
diameter
are
made
and
a
long
swinging
line
can
be
done
without
their
breaking
for
drawings
that
are
intended
as
things
of
beauty
in
themselves
and
are
not
merely
done
as
a
preparatory
study
for
a
painting
charcoal
is
perhaps
not
so
refined
a
medium
as
a
great
many
others
it
is
too
much
like
painting
to
have
the
particular
beauties
of
a
drawing
and
too
much
like
drawing
to
have
the
qualities
of
a
painting
however
some
beautiful
things
have
been
done
with
it
it
is
useful
in
doing
studies
where
much
finish
is
desired
to
fix
the
work
slightly
when
drawn
in
and
carried
some
way
on
you
can
work
over
this
again
without
continually
rubbing
out
with
your
hand
what
you
have
already
drawn
if
necessary
you
can
rub
out
with
a
hard
piece
of
rubber
any
parts
that
have
already
been
fixed
or
even
scrape
with
a
but
this
is
not
advisable
for
anything
but
an
academic
study
or
working
drawings
as
it
spoils
the
beauty
and
freshness
of
charcoal
work
studies
done
in
this
medium
can
also
be
finished
with
conté
chalk
there
is
also
an
artificial
charcoal
put
up
in
sticks
that
is
very
good
for
refined
work
it
has
some
advantages
over
natural
charcoal
in
that
there
are
no
knots
and
it
works
much
more
evenly
the
best
natural
charcoal
i
have
used
is
the
french
make
known
as
fusain
rouget
it
is
made
in
three
degrees
no
being
the
softest
and
of
course
the
blackest
but
some
of
the
ordinary
venetian
and
vine
charcoals
sold
are
good
but
do
get
the
cheaper
varieties
a
bad
piece
of
charcoal
is
worse
than
useless
charcoal
is
fixed
by
means
of
a
solution
of
white
shellac
dissolved
in
spirits
of
wine
blown
on
with
a
spray
diffuser
this
is
sold
by
the
artists
colourmen
or
can
be
easily
made
by
the
student
it
lightly
deposits
a
thin
film
of
shellac
over
the
work
acting
as
a
varnish
and
preventing
its
rubbing
off
charcoal
is
not
on
the
whole
the
medium
an
artist
with
a
pure
love
of
form
selects
but
rather
that
of
the
painter
who
uses
it
when
his
brushes
and
paints
are
not
handy
sidenote
red
chalk
sanguine
a
delightful
medium
that
can
be
used
for
either
pure
line
work
or
a
mixed
method
of
drawing
is
red
chalk
this
natural
red
earth
is
one
of
the
most
ancient
materials
for
drawing
it
is
a
lovely
venetian
red
in
colour
and
works
well
in
the
natural
state
if
you
get
a
good
piece
it
is
sold
by
the
ounce
and
it
is
advisable
to
try
the
pieces
as
they
vary
very
much
some
being
hard
and
gritty
and
some
more
soft
and
smooth
it
is
also
made
by
conté
of
paris
in
sticks
artificially
prepared
these
work
well
and
are
never
gritty
but
are
not
so
hard
as
the
natural
chalk
and
consequently
wear
away
quickly
and
do
not
make
fine
lines
as
well
red
chalk
when
rubbed
with
the
finger
or
a
rag
spreads
evenly
on
paper
and
produces
a
middle
tone
on
which
lights
can
be
drawn
with
rubber
or
bread
sticks
of
hard
pointed
rubber
are
everywhere
sold
which
cut
in
a
chisel
shape
work
beautifully
on
red
chalk
drawings
bread
is
also
excellent
when
a
softer
light
is
wanted
you
can
continually
correct
and
redraw
in
this
medium
by
rubbing
it
with
the
finger
or
a
rag
thus
destroying
the
lights
and
shadows
to
a
large
extent
and
enabling
you
to
draw
them
again
more
carefully
for
this
reason
red
chalk
is
greatly
to
be
recommended
for
making
drawings
for
a
picture
where
much
fumbling
may
be
necessary
before
you
find
what
you
want
unlike
charcoal
it
hardly
needs
fixing
and
much
more
intimate
study
of
the
forms
can
be
got
into
it
most
of
the
drawings
by
the
author
reproduced
in
this
book
are
done
in
this
medium
for
drawings
intended
to
have
a
separate
existence
it
is
one
of
the
prettiest
mediums
in
fact
this
is
the
danger
to
the
student
while
studying
your
drawing
looks
so
much
at
its
best
that
you
are
apt
to
be
satisfied
too
soon
but
for
portrait
drawings
there
is
no
medium
to
equal
it
additional
quality
of
dark
is
occasionally
got
by
mixing
a
little
of
this
red
chalk
in
a
powdered
state
with
water
and
a
very
little
this
can
be
applied
with
a
sable
brush
as
in
painting
and
makes
a
rich
velvety
dark
it
is
necessary
to
select
your
paper
with
some
care
the
ordinary
paper
has
too
much
size
on
it
this
is
picked
up
by
the
chalk
and
will
prevent
its
marking
a
paper
with
little
size
is
best
or
old
paper
where
the
size
has
perished
i
find
an
paper
made
for
printing
etchings
as
good
as
any
for
ordinary
work
it
is
not
perfect
but
works
very
well
what
one
wants
is
the
smoothest
paper
without
a
faced
and
surface
and
it
is
difficult
to
find
occasionally
black
chalk
is
used
with
the
red
to
add
strength
to
it
and
some
draughtsmen
use
it
with
the
red
in
such
a
manner
as
to
produce
almost
a
full
colour
effect
holbein
who
used
this
medium
largely
tinted
the
paper
in
most
of
his
portrait
drawings
varying
the
tint
very
much
and
sometimes
using
zinc
white
as
a
wash
which
enabled
him
to
supplement
his
work
with
a
line
here
and
there
and
also
got
over
any
difficulty
the
size
in
the
paper
might
cause
his
aim
seems
to
have
been
to
select
the
few
essential
things
in
a
head
and
draw
them
with
great
finality
and
exactness
in
many
of
the
drawings
the
earlier
work
has
been
done
with
red
or
black
chalk
and
then
rubbed
down
and
the
drawing
redone
with
either
a
brush
and
some
of
the
chalk
rubbed
up
with
water
and
gum
or
a
line
of
great
purity
while
in
others
he
has
tinted
the
paper
with
and
rubbed
this
away
to
the
white
paper

he
wanted

black
conté
is
a
hard
black
chalk
made
in
small
sticks
of
different
degrees
it
is
also
put
up
in
cedar
pencils
rather
more
gritty
than
red
chalk
or
charcoal
it
is
a
favourite
medium
with
some
and
can
be
used
with
advantage
to
supplement
charcoal
when
more
precision
and
definition
are
wanted
it
has
very
much
the
same
quality
of
line
and
so
does
not
show
as
a
different
medium
it
can
be
rubbed
like
charcoal
and
red
chalk
and
will
spread
a
tone
over
the
paper
in
very
much
the
same
way
carbon
pencils
are
similar
to
conté
but
smoother
in

do
not

sometimes
used
on

while
the

and
outlines
are
drawn

lithography

a

has

much
in
public

by
being
put

of
inartistic
trade
uses
it
is
really
one
of
the
most
wonderful
means
of
reproducing
an
artist
actual
work
the
result
being
in
most
cases
so
identical
with
the
original
that
seen
together
if
the
original
drawing
has
been
done
on
paper
it
is
almost
impossible
to
distinguish
any
difference
and
of
course
as
in
etching
it
is
the
prints
that
are
really
the
originals
the
initial
work
is
only
done
as
a
means
of
producing
these
a
drawing
is
made
on
a
lithographic
stone
that
is
a
piece
of
limestone
that
has
been
prepared
with
an
almost
perfectly
smooth
surface
the
chalk
used
is
a
special
kind
of
a
greasy
nature
and
is
made
in
several
degrees
of
hardness
and
softness
no
rubbing
out
is
possible
but
lines
can
be
scratched
out
with
a
knife
or
parts
made
lighter
by
white
lines
being
drawn
by
a
knife
over
them
a
great
range
of
freedom
and
variety
is
possible
in
these
initial
drawings
on
stone
the
chalk
can
be
rubbed
up
with
a
little
water
like
a
cake
of
and
applied
with
a
brush
and
every
variety
of
tone
can
be
made
with
the
side
of
the
chalk
some
care
should
be
taken
not
to
let
the
warm
finger
touch
the
stone
or
it
may
make
a
greasy
mark
that
will
print
when
this
initial
drawing
is
done
to
the
artist
satisfaction
the
most
usual
method
is
to
treat
the
stone
with
a
solution
of
and
a
little
nitric
acid
after
this
is
dry
the
gum
is
washed
off
as
far
as
may
be
with
water
some
of
the
gum
is
left
in
the
porous
stone
but
it
is
rejected
where
the
greasy
lines
and
tones
of
the
drawing
come
prints
may
now
be
obtained
by
rolling
up
the
stone
with
an
inked
roller
the
ink
is
composed
of
a
varnish
of
boiled
linseed
oil
and
any
of
the
lithographic
colours
to
be
commercially
obtained
the
ink
does
not
take
on
the
damp
gummed
stone
but
only
where
the
lithographic
chalk
has
made
a
greasy
mark
so
that
a
perfect
facsimile
of
the
drawing
on
stone
is
obtained
when
a
sheet
of
paper
is
placed
on
the
stone
and
the
whole
put
through
the
press
the
medium
deserves
to
be
much
more
popular
with
draughtsmen
than
it
is
as
no
more
perfect
means
of
reproduction
could
be
devised
the
lithographic
stone
is
rather
a
cumbersome
thing
to
handle
but
the
initial
drawing
can
be
done
on
paper
and
afterwards
transferred
to
the
stone
in
the
case
of
line
work
the
result
is
practically
identical
but
where
much
tone
and
playing
about
with
the
chalk
is
indulged
in
the
stone
is
much
better
lithographic
papers
of
different
textures
are
made
for
this
purpose

almost
any
paper
will
do

the
drawing
is
done

medium
for

much
to

out

made

are
useful
when

are
wanted
they
sometimes
have
a

underneath
to
hold
the

somewhat
in

manner
as

there

etching
is
a
process
of
reproduction
that
consists
in
drawing
with
a
steel
point
on
a
waxed
plate
of
copper

zinc
and
then
putting
it
in

bite
in

the
longer
the
plate
remains
in
the
bath
the
deeper
and
darker
the
lines
become
so
that
variety
in
thickness
is
got
by
stopping
out
with
a
varnish
the
light
lines
when
they
are
sufficiently
strong
and
letting
the
darker
ones
have
a
longer
exposure
to
the

many
wonderful
and
beautiful
things
have
been
done
with
this
simple
means
the
printing
consists
in
inking
the
plate
all
over
and
wiping
off
until
only
the
lines
retain
any
ink
when
the

is
put
in

taken

may
be
left

is
wanted

may
be
smudged
out

give
them
a
softer

the
only
safe
substance
for
good
papers
and
artists
now
have
in
the
papers
a
large
series
that
they
can
rely
on
being
made
of
linen
only
it
is
sometimes
advisable
when
you
are
not
drawing
a
subject
that
demands
a
clear
hard
line
but
where
more
sympathetic
qualities
are
wanted
to
have
a
wad
of
several
sheets
of
paper
under
the
one
you
are
working
on
pinned
on
the
this
gives
you
a
more
sympathetic
surface
to
work
upon
and
improves
the
quality
of
your
work
in
redrawing
a
study
with
which
you
are
not
quite
satisfied
it
is
a
good
plan
to
use
a
thin
paper
pinning
it
over
the
first
study
so
that
it
can
be
seen
through
one
can
by
this
means
start
as
it
were
from

point

conclusion
mechanical
invention
mechanical
knowledge
and
even
a
mechanical
theory
of
the
universe
have
so
influenced
the
average
modern
mind
that
it
has
been
thought
necessary
in
the
foregoing
pages
to
speak
out
strongly
against
the
idea
of
a
mechanical
standard
of
accuracy
in
artistic
drawing
if
there
were
such
a
standard
the
photographic
camera
would
serve
our
purpose
well
enough
and
considering
how
largely
this
idea
is
held
one
need
not
be
surprised
that
some
painters
use
the
camera
indeed
the
wonder
is
that
they
do
not
use
it
more
as
it
gives
in
some
perfection
the
mechanical
accuracy
which
is
all
they
seem
to
aim
at
in
their
work
there
may
be
times
when
the
camera
can
be
of
use
to
artists
but
only
to
those
who
are
thoroughly
competent
to
do
without
it
to
those
who
can
look
as
it
were
through
the
photograph
and
draw
from
it
with
the
same
freedom
and
spontaneity
with
which
they
would
draw
from
nature
thus
avoiding
its
dead
mechanical
accuracy
which
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
do
but
the
camera
is
a
convenience
to
be
avoided
by
the
student
now
although
it
has
been
necessary
to
insist
strongly
on
the
difference
between
phenomena
mechanically
recorded
and
the
records
of
a
living
individual
consciousness
i
should
be
very
sorry
if
anything
said
should
lead
students
to
assume
that
a
loose
and
careless
manner
of
study
was
in
any
way
advocated
the
training
of
his
eye
and
hand
to
the
most
painstaking
accuracy
of
observation
and
record
must
be
the
student
aim
for
many
years
the
variations
on
mechanical
accuracy
in
the
work
of
a
fine
draughtsman
need
not
be
and
seldom
are
conscious
variations
mechanical
accuracy
is
a
much
easier
thing
to
accomplish
than
accuracy
to
the
subtle
perceptions
of
the
artist
and
he
who
can
not
draw
with
great
precision
the
ordinary
cold
aspect
of
things
can
not
hope
to
catch
the
fleeting
aspect
of
his
finer
vision
those
artists
who
can
only
draw
in
some
weird
fashion
remote
from
nature
may
produce
work
of
some
interest
but
they
are
too
much
at
the
mercy
of
a
natural
trick
of
hand
to
hope
to
be
more
than
interesting
curiosities
in
art
the
object
of
your
training
in
drawing
should
be
to
develop
to
the
uttermost
the
observation
of
form
and
all
that
it
signifies
and
your
powers
of
accurately
portraying
this
on
paper
unflinching
honesty
must
be
observed
in
all
your
studies
it
is
only
then
that
the
you
in
you
will
eventually
find
expression
in
your
work
and
it
is
this
personal
quality
this
recording
of
the
impressions
of
life
as
felt
by
a
conscious
individual
that
is
the
very
essence
of
distinction
in
art
the
seeking
after
originality
so
much
advocated
would
be
better
put
seeking
for
sincerity
seeking
for
originality
usually
resolves
itself
into
running
after
any
peculiarity
in
manner
that
the
changing
fashions
of
a
restless
age
may
throw
up
one
of
the
most
original
men
who
ever
lived
did
not
trouble
to
invent
the
plots
of
more
than
three
or
four
of
his
plays
but
was
content
to
take
the
hackneyed
work
of
his
time
as
the
vehicle
through
which
to
pour
the
rich
treasures
of
his
vision
of
life
and
wrote
what
custom
wills
in
all
things
do
you
do
it
individual
style
will
come
to
you
naturally
as
you
become
more
conscious
of
what
it
is
you
wish
to
express
there
are
two
kinds
of
insincerity
in
style
the
employment
of
a
conventional
manner
that
is
not
understood
and
that
does
not
fit
the
matter
and
the
running
after
and
laboriously
seeking
an
original
manner
when
no
original
matter
exists
good
style
depends
on
a
clear
idea
of
what
it
is
you
wish
to
do
it
is
the
shortest
means
to
the
end
aimed
at
the
most
apt
manner
of
conveying
that
personal
something
that
is
in
all
good
work
the
style
is
the
man
as
flaubert
says
the
splendour
and
value
of
your
style
will
depend
on
the
splendour
and
value
of
the
mental
vision
inspired
in
you
that
you
seek
to
convey
on
the
quality
of
the
man
in
other
words
and
this
is
not
a
matter
where
direct
teaching
can
help
you
but
rests
between
your
own
consciousness
and
those
higher
powers
that
move
it
appendix
if
you
add
a
line
of
inches
to
one
of
inches
you
produce
one
inches
long
and
if
you
proceed
by
always
adding
the
last
two
you
arrive
at
a
series
of
lengths
inches
william
schooling
tells
me
that
any
two
of
these
lines
adjoining
one
another
are
practically
in
the
same
proportion
to
each
other
that
is
to
say
one
inches
is
times
the
size
of
one
inches
and
the
line
is
the
size
of
the
and
the
line
being
times
the
line
and
so
on
with
the
mathematician
love
of
accuracy
mr
schooling
has
worked
out
the
exact
proportion
that
should
exist
between
a
series
of
quantities
for
them
to
be
in
the
same
proportion
to
their
neighbours
and
in
which
any
two
added
together
would
produce
the
next
there
is
only
one
proportion
that
will
do
this
and
although
very
formidable
stated
exactly
for
practical
purposes
it
is
that
between
and
a
fraction
over
stated
accurately
to
eleven
places
of
decimals
it
is
sqrt
nearly
we
have
evidently
here
a
very
unique
proportion
mr
schooling
has
called
this
the
phi
proportion
and
it
will
be
convenient
to
refer
to
it
by
this
name
