translator
preface
perhaps
some
apology
ought
to
be
given
to
english
scholars
that
is
those
who
do
not
know
german
to
those
at
least
who
do
not
know
what
sort
of
a
thing
faust
is
in
the
original
for
offering
another
translation
to
the
public
of
a
poem
which
has
been
already
translated
not
only
in
a
literal
prose
form
but
also
twenty
or
thirty
times
in
metre
and
sometimes
with
great
spirit
beauty
and
power
the
author
of
the
present
version
then
has
no
knowledge
that
a
rendering
of
this
wonderful
poem
into
the
exact
and
metre
of
the
original
has
until
now
been
so
much
as
attempted
to
name
only
one
defect
the
very
best
versions
which
he
has
seen
neglect
to
follow
the
exquisite
artist
in
the
evidently
planned
and
orderly
intermixing
of
and
rhymes
rhymes
which
fall
on
the
last
syllable
and
those
which
fall
on
the
last
but
one
now
every
careful
student
of
the
versification
of
faust
must
feel
and
see
that
goethe
did
not
intersperse
the
one
kind
of
rhyme
with
the
other
at
random
as
those
translators
do
who
also
give
the
female
rhyme
on
which
the
vivacity
of
dialogue
and
description
often
so
much
depends
in
so
small
a
proportion
a
similar
criticism
might
be
made
of
their
liberty
in
neglecting
method
of
alternating
different
measures
with
each
other
it
seems
as
if
in
respect
to
metre
at
least
they
had
asked
themselves
how
would
goethe
have
written
or
shaped
this
in
english
had
that
been
his
native
language
instead
of
seeking
and
as
they
should
have
done
to
reproduce
both
in
spirit
and
in
form
the
movement
so
free
and
yet
orderly
of
the
singularly
endowed
and
accomplished
poet
whom
they
undertook
to
represent
as
to
the
objections
which
hayward
and
some
of
his
reviewers
have
instituted
in
advance
against
the
possibility
of
a
good
and
faithful
metrical
translation
of
a
poem
like
faust
they
seem
to
the
present
translator
full
of
paradox
and
sophistry
for
instance
take
this
assertion
of
one
of
the
reviewers
the
sacred
and
mysterious
union
of
thought
with
verse
and
immortally
wedded
from
the
moment
of
their
common
birth
can
never
be
understood
by
those
who
desire
verse
translations
of
good
poetry
if
the
last
part
of
this
statement
had
read
by
those
who
can
be
contented
with
translations
of
good
poetry
the
position
would
have
been
nearer
the
truth
this
much
we
might
well
admit
that
if
the
alternative
were
either
to
have
a
poem
like
faust
in
a
metre
different
and
glaringly
different
from
the
original
or
to
have
it
in
simple
and
strong
prose
then
the
latter
alternative
would
be
the
one
every
tasteful
and
feeling
scholar
would
prefer
but
surely
to
every
one
who
can
read
the
original
or
wants
to
know
how
this
great
song
as
carlyle
says
out
of
goethe
soul
a
mere
prose
rendering
must
be
comparatively
a
the
translator
most
heartily
dissents
from
hayward
assertion
that
a
translator
of
faust
must
sacrifice
either
metre
or
meaning
at
least
he
flatters
himself
that
he
has
made
in
the
main
not
a
compromise
between
meaning
and
melody
though
in
certain
instances
he
may
have
fallen
into
that
but
a
combination
of
the
meaning
with
the
melody
which
latter
is
so
important
so
vital
a
part
of
the
lyric
poem
meaning
in
any
worthy
sense
no
poetic
translation
says
hayward
reviewer
already
quoted
can
give
the
rhythm
and
rhyme
of
the
original
it
can
only
substitute
the
rhythm
and
rhyme
of
the
translator
one
might
just
as
well
say
no
translation
can
give
the
and
of
the
original
it
can
only
substitute
the
and
spirit
of
the
words
and
phrases
of
the
translator
and
then
these
two
assertions
balancing
each
other
there
will
remain
in
the
metrical
translator
favor
that
he
may
come
as
near
to
giving
both
the
letter
and
the
spirit
as
the
effects
of
the
babel
dispersion
will
allow
as
to
the
original
creation
which
he
has
attempted
here
to
reproduce
the
translator
might
say
something
but
prefers
leaving
his
readers
to
the
poet
himself
as
revealed
in
the
poem
and
to
the
various
commentaries
of
which
we
have
some
accounts
at
least
in
english
a
french
translator
of
the
poem
speaks
in
his
introduction
as
follows
this
faust
conceived
by
him
in
his
youth
completed
in
ripe
age
the
idea
of
which
he
carried
with
him
through
all
the
commotions
of
his
life
as
camoens
bore
his
poem
with
him
through
the
waves
this
faust
contains
him
entire
the
thirst
for
knowledge
and
the
martyrdom
of
doubt
had
they
not
tormented
his
early
years
whence
came
to
him
the
thought
of
taking
refuge
in
a
supernatural
realm
of
appealing
to
invisible
powers
which
plunged
him
for
a
considerable
time
into
the
dreams
of
illuminati
and
made
him
even
invent
a
religion
this
irony
of
mephistopheles
who
carries
on
so
audacious
a
game
with
the
weakness
and
the
desires
of
man
is
it
not
the
mocking
scornful
side
of
the
poet
spirit
a
leaning
to
sullenness
which
can
be
traced
even
into
the
earliest
years
of
his
life
a
bitter
leaven
thrown
into
a
strong
soul
forever
by
early
satiety
the
character
of
faust
especially
the
man
whose
burning
untiring
heart
can
neither
enjoy
fortune
nor
do
without
it
who
gives
himself
unconditionally
and
watches
himself
with
mistrust
who
unites
the
enthusiasm
of
passion
and
the
dejectedness
of
despair
is
not
this
an
eloquent
opening
up
of
the
most
secret
and
tumultuous
part
of
the
poet
soul
and
now
to
complete
the
image
of
his
inner
life
he
has
added
the
transcendingly
sweet
person
of
margaret
an
exalted
reminiscence
of
a
young
girl
by
whom
at
the
age
of
fourteen
he
thought
himself
beloved
whose
image
ever
floated
round
him
and
has
contributed
some
traits
to
each
of
his
heroines
this
heavenly
surrender
of
a
simple
good
and
tender
heart
contrasts
wonderfully
with
the
sensual
and
gloomy
passion
of
the
lover
who
in
the
midst
of
his
is
persecuted
by
the
phantoms
of
his
imagination
and
by
the
nightmares
of
thought
with
those
sorrows
of
a
soul
which
is
crushed
but
not
extinguished
which
is
tormented
by
the
invincible
want
of
happiness
and
the
bitter
feeling
how
hard
a
thing
it
is
to
receive
or
to
bestow
dedication
once
more
ye
waver
dreamily
before
me
forms
that
so
early
cheered
my
troubled
eyes
to
hold
you
fast
doth
still
my
heart
implore
me
still
bid
me
clutch
the
charm
that
lures
and
flies
ye
crowd
around
come
then
hold
empire
me
as
from
the
mist
and
haze
of
thought
ye
rise
the
magic
atmosphere
your
train
enwreathing
through
my
thrilled
bosom
youthful
bliss
is
breathing
ye
bring
with
you
the
forms
of
hours
elysian
and
shades
of
dear
ones
rise
to
meet
my
gaze
first
love
and
friendship
steal
upon
my
vision
like
an
old
tale
of
legendary
days
sorrow
renewed
in
mournful
repetition
runs
through
life
devious
labyrinthine
ways
and
sighing
names
the
good
by
fortune
cheated
of
blissful
hours
who
have
before
me
fleeted
these
later
songs
of
mine
alas
will
never
sound
in
their
ears
to
whom
the
first
were
sung
scattered
like
dust
the
friendly
throng
forever
mute
the
first
echo
that
so
grateful
rung
to
the
strange
crowd
i
sing
whose
very
favor
like
chilling
sadness
on
my
heart
is
flung
and
all
that
kindled
at
those
earlier
numbers
roams
the
wide
earth
or
in
its
bosom
slumbers
and
now
i
feel
a
yearning
for
that
calm
pensive
like
an
aeolian
lyre
the
breeze
returning
floats
in
uncertain
tones
my
lisping
lay
strange
awe
comes
me
tear
on
tear
falls
burning
the
rigid
heart
to
milder
mood
gives
way
what
i
possess
i
see
afar
off
lying
and
what
i
lost
is
real
and
undying
prelude
in
the
theatre
dramatic
poet
merry
you
who
in
trouble
and
distress
have
both
held
fast
your
old
allegiance
what
think
ye
here
in
german
regions
our
enterprise
may
hope
success
to
please
the
crowd
my
purpose
has
been
steady
because
they
live
and
let
one
live
at
least
the
posts
are
set
the
boards
are
laid
already
and
every
one
is
looking
for
a
feast
they
sit
with
lifted
brows
composed
looks
wearing
expecting
something
that
shall
set
them
staring
i
know
the
public
palate
that
confest
yet
never
pined
so
for
a
sound
suggestion
true
they
are
not
accustomed
to
the
best
but
they
have
read
a
dreadful
deal
past
question
how
shall
we
work
to
make
all
fresh
and
new
acceptable
and
profitable
too
for
sure
i
love
to
see
the
torrent
boiling
when
towards
our
booth
they
crowd
to
find
a
place
now
rolling
on
a
space
and
then
recoiling
then
squeezing
through
the
narrow
door
of
grace
long
before
dark
each
one
his
station
in
sight
of
the
window
takes
and
as
round
bakers
doors
men
crowd
to
escape
starvation
for
tickets
here
they
almost
break
their
necks
this
wonder
on
so
mixed
a
mass
the
poet
alone
can
work
my
friend
o
show
it
oh
speak
not
to
me
of
that
motley
ocean
whose
roar
and
greed
the
shuddering
spirit
chill
hide
from
my
sight
that
billowy
commotion
that
draws
us
down
the
whirlpool
our
will
no
lead
me
to
that
nook
of
calm
devotion
where
blooms
pure
joy
upon
the
muses
hill
where
love
and
friendship
aye
create
and
cherish
with
hand
divine
that
never
perish
ah
what
from
feeling
deepest
fountain
springing
scarce
from
the
stammering
lips
had
faintly
passed
now
hopeful
venturing
forth
now
shyly
clinging
to
the
wild
moment
cry
a
prey
is
cast
oft
when
for
years
the
brain
had
heard
it
ringing
it
comes
in
full
and
rounded
shape
at
last
what
shines
is
born
but
for
the
moment
pleasure
the
genuine
leaves
posterity
a
treasure
posterity
i
sick
of
hearing
of
it
supposing
i
the
future
age
would
profit
who
then
would
furnish
ours
with
fun
for
it
must
have
it
ripe
and
mellow
the
presence
of
a
fine
young
fellow
is
cheering
too
methinks
to
any
one
whoso
can
pleasantly
communicate
will
not
make
war
with
popular
caprices
for
as
the
circle
waxes
great
the
power
his
word
shall
wield
increases
come
then
and
let
us
now
a
model
see
let
phantasy
with
all
her
various
choir
sense
reason
passion
sensibility
but
mark
me
folly
too
the
scene
inspire
but
the
great
point
is
action
every
one
comes
as
spectator
and
the
show
the
fun
let
but
the
plot
be
spun
off
fast
and
thickly
so
that
the
crowd
shall
gape
in
broad
surprise
then
have
you
made
a
wide
impression
quickly
you
are
the
man
they
idolize
the
mass
can
only
be
impressed
by
masses
then
each
at
last
picks
out
his
proper
part
give
much
and
then
to
each
one
something
passes
and
each
one
leaves
the
house
with
happy
heart
have
you
a
piece
give
it
at
once
in
pieces
such
a
ragout
your
fame
increases
it
costs
as
little
pains
to
play
as
to
invent
but
what
is
gained
if
you
a
whole
present
your
public
picks
it
presently
to
pieces
you
do
not
feel
how
mean
a
trade
like
that
must
be
in
the
true
artist
eyes
how
false
and
hollow
our
genteel
botchers
well
i
see
have
given
the
maxims
that
you
follow
such
charges
pass
me
like
the
idle
wind
a
man
who
has
right
work
in
mind
must
choose
the
instruments
most
fitting
consider
what
soft
wood
you
have
for
splitting
and
keep
in
view
for
whom
you
write
if
this
one
from
seeks
flight
that
other
comes
full
from
the
groaning
table
or
the
worst
case
of
all
to
cite
from
reading
journals
is
for
thought
unable
vacant
and
giddy
all
agog
for
wonder
as
to
a
masquerade
they
wing
their
way
the
ladies
give
themselves
and
all
their
precious
plunder
and
without
wages
help
us
play
on
your
poetic
heights
what
dream
comes
you
what
glads
a
crowded
house
behold
your
patrons
in
array
before
you
one
half
are
raw
the
other
cold
one
after
this
play
hopes
to
play
at
cards
one
a
wild
night
to
spend
beside
his
doxy
chooses
poor
fools
why
court
ye
the
regards
for
such
a
set
of
the
chaste
muses
i
tell
you
give
them
more
and
ever
more
and
more
and
then
your
mark
you
hardly
stray
from
ever
to
mystify
be
your
endeavor
to
satisfy
is
labor
sore
what
ails
you
are
you
pleased
or
pained
what
notion
go
to

thyself
another
slave
what
and
the
lofty
birthright

gave
the
noblest

heaven
to

the
poet
fling
to
folly
ocean
how
does
he
stir
each
deep
emotion
how
does
he
conquer
every
element
but
by
the
tide
of
song
that
from
his
bosom
springs
and
draws
into
his
heart
all
living
things
when

endless
iteration

thread
across

whizzing

full

these
a

the
multitude
the
fairest

of

listening
before

the
revelation

melancholy
heart

soft
eyes
glistening
draws
sad
sweet
nourishment
from
your
creation
this
passion
now
now
that
is
stirred
by
turns
and
each
one
sees
what
in
his
bosom
burns
open
alike
as
yet
to
weeping
and
to
laughter
they
still
admire
the
flights
they
still
enjoy
the
show
him

is
formed

thereafter
the
yet
unformed
with
thanks
will
ever
glow
ay
give
me
back
the
joyous
hours
when
i
myself
was
ripening
too
when
song
the
fount
flung
up
its
showers
of
beauty
ever
fresh
and
new
when
a
soft
haze
the
world
was
veiling
each
bud
a
miracle
bespoke
and
from
their
stems
a
thousand
flowers
i
broke
their
fragrance
through
the
vales
exhaling
i
nothing
and
yet
all
possessed
yearning
for
truth
and
in
illusion
blest
give
me
the
freedom
of
that
hour
the
tear
of
joy
the
pleasing
pain
of
hate
and
love
the
thrilling
power
oh
give
me
back
my
youth
again
youth
my
good
friend
thou
needest
certainly
when
ambushed
foes
are
on
thee
springing
when
loveliest
maidens
witchingly
their
white
arms
round
thy
neck
are
flinging
when
the
far
garland
meets
thy
glance
high
on
the
goal
suspended
when
after
many
a
mazy
dance
in
drink
and
song
the
night
is
ended
but
with
a
free

alternating
with

profound
up

thou

once

and
how
we
do
dost
graciously
inquire
and
to
be
pleased
to
see
me
once
didst
deign
i
too
among
thy
household
venture
nigher
pardon
high
words
i
can
not
labor
after
though
the
whole
court
should
look
on
me
with
scorn
my
pathos
certainly
would
stir
thy
laughter
hadst
thou
not
laughter
long
since
quite
forsworn
of
sun
and
worlds
i
nought
to
tell
worth
mention
how
men
torment
themselves
takes
my
attention
the
little
god
o
the
world
jogs
on
the
same
old
way
and
is
as
singular
as
on
the
world
first
day
a
pity
is
thou
shouldst
have
given
the
fool
to
make
him
worse
a
gleam
of
light
from
heaven
he
calls
it
reason
using
it
to
be
more
beast
than
ever
beast
was
yet
he
seems
to
me
your
grace
the
word
will
pardon
like
a
grasshopper
in
the
garden
forever
on
the
wing
and
hops
and
sings
the
same
old
song
as
in
the
grass
he
springs
would
he
but
stay
there
no
he
needs
must
muddle
his
prying
nose
in
every
puddle
hast
nothing
for
our
edification
still
thy
old
work
of
accusation
will
things
on
earth
be
never
right
for
thee
no
lord
i
find
them
still
as
bad
as
bad
can
be
poor
souls
their
miseries
seem
so
much
to
please
i
scarce
can
find
it
in
my
heart
to
tease
knowest
thou
faust
the
doctor
ay
my
servant
he
forsooth
he
serves
you
in
a
famous
fashion
no
earthly
meat
or
drink
can
feed
his
passion
its
grasping
greed
no
space
can
measure
and
he
finds
no
rest
the
fairest
stars
of
heaven
must
swell
his
treasure
each
highest
joy
of
earth
must
yield
its
zest
not
all
the
world
the
boundless
azure
can
fill
the
void
within
his
craving
breast
he
serves
me
somewhat
darkly
now
i
grant
yet
will
he
soon
attain
the
light
of
reason
sees
not
the
gardener
in
the
green
young
plant
that
bloom
and
fruit
shall
deck
its
coming
season
what
will
you
bet
you
surely
lose
your
wager
if
you
will
give
me
leave
henceforth
to
lead
him
softly
on
like
an
old
stager
so
long
as
he
shall
live
on
earth
do
with
him
all
that
you
desire
man
errs
and
staggers
from
his
birth
thank
you
i
never
did
aspire
to
have
with
dead
folk
much
transaction
in
full
fresh
cheeks
i
take
the
greatest
satisfaction
a
corpse
will
never
find
me
in
the
house
i
love
to
play
as
puss
does
with
the
mouse
all
right
i
give
thee
full
permission
draw
down
this
spirit
from
its
source
and
canst
thou
catch
him
to
perdition
carry
him
with
thee
in
thy
course
but
stand
abashed
if
thou
must
needs
confess
that
a
good
man
though
passion
blur
his
vision
has
of
the
right
way
still
a
consciousness
good
but
i
make
it
a
short
story
about
my
wager
i
by
no
means
sorry
and
if
i
gain
my
end
with
glory
allow
me
to
exult
from
a
full
breast
dust
shall
he
eat
and
that
with
zest
like
my
old
aunt
the
snake
whose
fame
is
hoary
well
go
and
come
and
make
thy
trial
the
like
of
thee
i
never
yet
did
hate
of
all
the
spirits
of
denial
the
scamp
is
he
i
best
can
tolerate
man
is
too
prone
at
best
to
seek
the
way
that
easy
he
soon
grows
fond
of
unconditioned
rest
and
therefore
such
a
comrade
suits
him
best
who
spurs
and
works
true
devil
always
busy
but
you
true
sons
of
god
in
growing
measure
enjoy
rich
beauty
living
stores
of
pleasure
the
word
divine
that
lives
and
works
for
aye
fold
you
in
boundless
love
embrace
alluring
and
what
in
floating
vision
glides
away
that
seize
ye
and
make
fast
with
thoughts
enduring
closes
the
archangels
alone
i
like
at
times
to
exchange
with
him
a
word
and
take
care
not
to
break
with
him
is
civil
in
the
old
fellow
and
so
great
a
lord
to
talk
so
kindly
with
the
very
devil
faust
in
a
narrow
gothic
faust
uneasy
at
his
have
now
alas
quite
studied
through
philosophy
and
medicine
and
law
and
ah
theology
too
with
hot
desire
the
truth
to
win
and
here
at
last
i
stand
poor
fool
as
wise
as
when
i
entered
school
am
called
magister
doctor
indeed
ten
livelong
years
cease
not
to
lead
backward
and
forward
to
and
fro
my
scholars
by
the
nose
and
lo
just
nothing
i
see
is
the
sum
of
our
learning
to
the
very
core
of
my
heart
is
burning
is
true
i
more
clever
than
all
the
foplings
doctors
magisters
authors
and
popelings
am
plagued
by
no
scruple
nor
doubt
nor
cavil
nor
lingering
fear
of
hell
or
devil
what
then
all
pleasure
is
fled
forever
to
know
one
thing
i
vainly
endeavor
there
nothing
wherein
one
could
be
mended
or
bettered
with
me
for
a
teacher
and
then
too
nor
goods
nor
gold
have
i
nor
fame
nor
worldly
dignity
a
condition
no
dog
could
longer
live
in
and
so
to
magic
my
soul
i
given
if
haply
by
spirits
mouth
and
might
some
mysteries
may
not
be
brought
to
light
that
to
teach
no
longer
may
be
my
lot
with
bitter
sweat
what
i
need
to
be
taught
that
i
may
know
what
the
world
contains
in
its
innermost
heart
and
finer
veins
see
all
its
energies
and
seeds
and
deal
no
more
in
words
but
in
deeds
o
full
round
moon
didst
thou
but
thine
for
the
last
time
on
this
woe
of
mine
thou
whom
so
many
a
midnight
i
have
watched
at
this
desk
come
up
the
sky
books
and
papers
a
dreary
pile
then
mournful
friend
uprose
thy
smile
oh
that
i
might
on
the
walk
in
the
noon
of
thy
blessed
light
round
with
spirits
hover
float
in
thy
gleamings
the
meadows
over
and
freed
from
the
fumes
of
a
brain
bathe
in
thy
dew
and
be
well
again
woe
and
these
walls
still
prison
me
dull
dismal
hole
my
curse
on
thee
where
heaven
own
light
with
its
blessed
beams
through
painted
panes
all
sickly
gleams
hemmed
in
by
these
old
tall
which
gnawed
by
worms
and
deep
in
must
rise
to
the
roof
against
a
wall
of
paper
thick
with
dust
glasses
boxes
where
eye
can
see
filled
with
old
obsolete
instruments
stuffed
with
old
heirlooms
of
implements
that
is
thy
world
there
a
world
for
thee
and
still
dost
ask
what
stifles
so
the
fluttering
heart
within
thy
breast
by
what
inexplicable
woe
the
springs
of
life
are
all
oppressed
instead
of
living
nature
where
god
made
and
planted
men
his
sons
through
smoke
and
mould
around
thee
stare
grim
skeletons
and
dead
men
bones
up
fly
far
out
into
the
land
and
this
mysterious
volume
see
by
nostradamus
own
hand
is
it
not
guide
enough
for
thee
then
shalt
thou
thread
the
starry
skies
and
taught
by
nature
in
her
walks
the
spirit
might
shall
thee
rise
as
ghost

ghost

here
explain
the
holy
signs
to
thee

bliss

wrote
each
sign

my
inner
tumult

with
rapture
filling

to
me
by
force

excuse
me
you
engaged
in
declamation
a
greek
tragedy
no
doubt
you
read
i
in
this
art
should
like
initiation
for
nowadays
it
stands
one
well
instead
i
often
heard
them
boast
a
preacher
might
profit
with
a
player
for
his
teacher
yes
when
the
preacher
is
a
player
granted
as
often
happens
in
our
modern
ways
ah
when
one
with
such
love
of
study
haunted
and
scarcely
sees
the
world
on
holidays
and
takes
a
as
it
were
to
read
it
how
can
one
by
persuasion
hope
to
lead
it
what
you
do
feel
you
never
catch
by
hunting
it
must
gush
out
spontaneous
from
the
soul
and
with
a
fresh
delight
enchanting
the
hearts
of
all
that
hear
control
sit
there
forever
thaw
your
blow
up
your
to
a
flame
and
brew
with
a
dull
fire
in
your
of
other
men
leavings
a
ragout
children
and
apes
will
gaze
delighted
if
their
critiques
can
pleasure
impart
but
never
a

be
ignited
comes
not
the

from
the

delivery
makes
the

success
there
i
still

i
confess
seek
honest
gains
without

be
not
a
fool
sound
understanding
and
good
sense
speak
out
with
little
art
or
rule
and
when
you
something
earnest
to
utter
why
hunt
for
words
in
such
a
flutter
yes
your
discourses
that
are
so
in
which
humanity
poor
shreds
you
frizzle
are
unrefreshing
as
the
mist
and
wind
that
through
the
withered
leaves
of
autumn
whistle
ah
god
well
art
is
long
and
life
is
short
and
fleeting
what
headaches
have
i
felt
and
what
when
critical
desire
was
strong
how
hard
it
is
the
ways
and
means
to
master
by
which
one
gains
each
and
ere

o

from

forever
slakes
no

element
thou
drinkest

up
from
thine

soul
the
fountain

excuse
me
in
these
olden
pages
we
catch
the
spirit
of
the
ages
we
see
what
wisest
men
before
our
day
have
thought
and
to
what
glorious
heights
we
their
bequests
have
brought
o
yes
we
reached

at

my

it

us
the

spirit
of
the
times
is
then
at
bottom
your
own
spirit
gentlemen
in
which
the
times
are
seen
reflected
and
often
such
a
mess
that
none
can
bear
it
at
the
first
sight
of
it
they
run
away
a
and
a
at
most
a
play
with
fine
pragmatic
maxims
teeming
the
mouths
of
puppets
but
then
the
world
the
heart
and
mind
of
man
to
know
of
these
who
would
not
pay
attention
to
know
them
yes
as
weaklings
can
who
dares
the
child
true
name
outright
to
mention
the
few
who
any
thing
thereof
have
learned
who
out
of
their
heart
fulness
needs
must
gabble
and
show
their
thoughts
and
feelings
to
the
rabble
have
evermore
been
crucified
and
burned
i
pray
you
friend
is
wearing
into
night
let
us
adjourn
here
for
the
present
i
had
been
glad
to
stay
till
morning
light
this
learned
talk
with
you
has
been
so
pleasant
but
the
first
day
of
easter
comes
and
then
an
hour
or
two
i
borrow
with
zeal
have
i
applied
myself
to
learning
true
i
know
much
yet
to
know
all
am
burning
see
how
in
head
only
hope
still
lingers
who
evermore
to
empty
rubbish
clings
with
greedy
hand
grubs
after
precious
things
and
leaps
for
joy
when
some
poor
worm
he
fingers
that
such
a
human
voice
should
dare
intrude
where
all
was
full
of
ghostly
tones
and
features
yet
ah
this
once
my
gratitude
is
due
to
thee
most
wretched
of
earth
creatures
thou
snatchedst
me
from
the
despairing
state
in
which
my
senses
well
nigh
crazed
were
sunken
the
apparition
was
so
that
to
a
very
dwarf
my
soul
had
shrunken
i
godlike
who
in
fancy
saw
but
now
eternal
truth
fair
glass
in
wondrous
nearness
rejoiced
in
heavenly
radiance
and
clearness
leaving
the
earthly
man
below
i
more
than
cherub
whose
free
force
dreamed
through
the
veins
of
nature
penetrating
to
taste
the
life
of
gods
like
them
creating
behold
me
this
presumption
expiating
a
word
of
thunder
sweeps
me
from
my
course
myself
with
thee
no
longer
dare
i
measure
had
i
the
power
to
draw
thee
down
at
pleasure
to
hold
thee
here
i
still
had
not
the
force
oh
in
that
blest
ecstatic
hour
i
felt
myself
so
small
so
great
thou
drovest
me
with
cruel
power
back
upon
man
uncertain
fate
what
shall
i
do
what
slum
thus
lonely
that
impulse
must
i
then
obey
alas
our
very
deeds
and
not
our
sufferings
only
how
do
they
hem
and
choke
life
way
to
all
the
mind
conceives
of
great
and
glorious
a
strange
and
baser
mixture
still
adheres
striving
for
earthly
good
are
we
victorious
a
dream
and
cheat
the
better
part
appears
the
feelings
that
could
once
such
noble
life
inspire
are
quenched
and
trampled
out
in
passion
mire
where
fantasy
erewhile
with
daring
flight
out
to
the
infinite
her
wings
expanded
a
little
space
can
now
suffice
her
quite
when
hope
on
hope
time
gulf
has
wrecked
and
stranded
care
builds
her
nest
far
down
the
heart
recesses
there
broods
dark
untold
distresses
restless
she
sits
and
scares
thy
joy
and
peace
away
she
puts
on
some
new
mask
with
each
new
day
herself
as
house
and
home
as
wife
and
child
presenting
as
fire
and
water
bane
and
blade
what
never
hits
makes
thee
afraid
and
what
is
never
lost
she
keeps
thee
still
lamenting
not
like
the
gods
am
i
too
deep
that
truth
is
thrust
but
like
the
worm
that
wriggles
through
the
dust
who
as
along
the
dust
for
food
he
feels
is
crushed
and
buried
by
the
traveller
heels
is
it
not
dust
that
makes
this
lofty
wall
groan
with
its
hundred
shelves
and
cases
the
rubbish
and
the
thousand
trifles
all
that
crowd
these
dark
places
here
shall
my
craving
heart
find
rest
must
i
perchance
a
thousand
books
turn
over
to
find
that
men
are
everywhere
distrest
and
here
and
there
one
happy
one
discover
why
thou
down
upon
me
hollow
skull
but
that
thy
brain
like
mine
once
trembling
hoping
sought
the
light
day
yet
ever
sorrowful
burned
for
the
truth
in
vain
in
twilight
groping
ye
instruments
of
course
are
mocking
me
its
wheels
cogs
bands
and
barrels
each
one
praises
i
waited
at
the
door
you
were
the
key
your
ward
is
nicely
turned
and
yet
no
bolt
it
raises
unlifted
in
the
broadest
day
doth
nature
veil
from
prying
eyes
defend
her
and
what
he
chooses
not
before
thee
to
display
not
all
thy
screws
and
levers
can
force
her
to
surrender
old
trumpery
not
that
i
used
thee
but
because
my
father
used
thee
thou
me
old
scroll
thou
hast
been
stained
with
smoke
and
smut
since
on
this
desk
the
lamp
first
dimly
gleamed
before
me
better
have
squandered
far
i
now
can
clearly
see
my
little
all
than
melt
beneath
it
in
this
tophet
that
which
thy
fathers
have
bequeathed
to
thee
earn
and
become
possessor
of
it
what
profits
not
a
weary
load
will
be
what
it
brings
forth
alone
can
yield
the
moment
profit
why
do
i
gaze
as
if
a
spell
had
bound
me
up
yonder
is
that
flask
a
magnet
to
the
eyes
what
lovely
light
so
sudden
blooms
around
me
as
when
in
nightly
woods
we
hail
the
i
greet
thee
rarest
phial
precious
potion
as
now
i
take
thee
down
with
deep
devotion
in
thee
i
venerate
man
wit
and
art
quintessence
of
all
soporific
flowers
extract
of
all
the
finest
deadly
powers
thy
favor
to
thy
master
now
impart
i
look
on
thee
the
sight
my
pain
appeases
i
handle
thee
the
strife
of
longing
ceases
the
of
the
spirit
ebbs
away
far
out
to
sea
i
drawn
sweet
voices
listening
the
glassy
waters
at
my
feet
are
glistening
to
new
shores
beckons
me
a
day
a
fiery
chariot
floats
on
airy
pinions
to
where
i
sit
willing
it
beareth
me
on
a
new
path
through
ether
blue
dominions
to
untried
spheres
of
pure
activity
this
lofty
life
this
bliss
elysian
worm
that
thou
waft
erewhile
deservest
thou
ay
on
this
earthly
sun
this
charming
vision
turn
thy
back
resolutely
now
boldly
draw
near
and
rend
the
gates
asunder
by
which
each
cowering
mortal
gladly
steals
now
is
the
time
to
show
by
deeds
of
wonder
that
manly
greatness
not
to
godlike
glory
yields
before
that
gloomy
pit
to
stand
unfearing
where
fantasy
in
its
own
torment
lies
still
onward
to
that
steering
around
whose
narrow
mouth
forever
rise
calmly
to
dare
the
step
serene
unshrinking
though
into
nothingness
the
hour
should
see
thee
sinking
now
then
come
down
from
thy
old
case
i
bid
thee
where
thou
forgotten
many
a
year
hast
hid
thee
into
thy
master
hand
pure
crystal
glass
the
of
the
fathers
thou
hast
brightened
the
hearts
of
gravest
guests
were
lightened
when
pledged
from
hand
to
hand
they
saw
thee
pass
thy
sides
with
many
a
curious
type
bedight
which
each
as
with
one
draught
he
quaffed
the
liquor
must
read
in
rhyme
from
off
the
wondrous
beaker
remind
me
ah
of
many
a
youthful
night
i
shall
not
hand
thee
now
to
any
neighbor
not
now
to
show
my
wit
upon
thy
carvings
labor
here
is
a
juice
of
might
the
rich
brown
flood
adown
thy
sides
is
streaming
with
my
own
choice
ingredients
teeming
be
this
last
draught
as
morning
now
is
gleaming
drained
as
a
lofty
pledge
to
greet
the
festal
light
puts
the
goblet
to
his
of
bells
and
choral
of
christ
hath
arisen
joy
to
humanity
no
more
shall
vanity
death
and
inanity
hold
thee
in
prison
what
hum
of
music
what
a
radiant
tone
thrills
through
me
from
my
lips
the
goblet
stealing
ye
murmuring
bells
already
make
ye
known
the
easter
morn
first
hour
with
solemn
pealing
sing
you
ye
choirs
now
the
glad
consoling
song
that
once
from
through
gloom
sepulchral
rung
a
new
immortal
covenant
sealing
of
spices
we
carried
laid
them
upon
his
breast
tenderly
buried
him
whom
we
loved
the
best
cleanly
to
bind
him
took
we
the
fondest
care
ah
and
we
find
him
now
no
more
there
of
christ
hath
ascended
reign
in
benignity
pain
and
indignity
scorn
and
malignity
work
have
ended
why
seek
ye
me
in
dust
forlorn
ye
heavenly
tones
with
soft
enchanting
go
greet
men
this
holy
morn
your
message
well
i
hear
but
faith
to
me
is
wanting

dearest
child
of
faith
is
born
to
yonder
spheres
i
dare
no
more
aspire
whence
the
sweet
tidings
downward
float
and
yet
from
childhood
heard
the
old
familiar
note
calls
back
now
to
life
my
warm
desire
ah
once
how
sweetly
fell
on
me
the
kiss
of
heavenly
love
in
the
still
sabbath
stealing
prophetically
rang
the
bells
with
solemn
pealing
a
prayer
was
then
the
ecstasy
of
bliss
a
blessed
and
mysterious
yearning
drew
me
to
roam
through
meadows
woods
and
skies
and
midst
a
thousand
burning
i
felt
a
world
within
me
rise
that
strain
oh
how
it
speaks
youth
gleesome
plays
and
feelings
joys
of
long
past
remembrance
holds
me
now
with
childhood
fond
appealings
back
from
the
fatal
step
the
last
sound
on
ye
heavenly
strains
that
bliss
restore
me
tears
gush
once
more
the
spell
of
earth
is
me
of
has
the
grave
lowly
one
risen
victorious

he
god
holy

and
glorious
he
in
this
blest
new
birth
rapture
creative
knows
ah
on
the
breast
of
earth

we
still
nature
woes
left
here
to
languish
lone
in
a
world
like
this
fills
us
with
anguish

bliss
of
christ
has
arisen
out
of
corruption
gloom

from
your
prison

tomb

messages

his
promises

fine
young
fellows
yonder

i
declare
a
great
disgrace

best

wonder
after
these
galls

two
more
behind
my
eyes
but
ai

take
us
by
and
bye
in
tow
no
brother
i
do
like
these
starched
up
ways

haste
before
the
game
slips
through
our
fingers
the
hand
that
swings
the
broom
o
saturdays
on
sundays
round
thy
neck
most
sweetly
lingers
no
i
do
like
at
all
this
burgomaster

insolence
grows
daily
ever
faster
no
good
from
him
the
town
will
get
will
things
grow
better
with
him
never
we
under
more
constraint
than
ever
and
pay
more
tax
than
ever
yet
good
gentlemen
and
you
fair
ladies
with
such
red
cheeks
and
handsome
dress
think
what
my
melancholy
trade
is
and
see
and
pity
my
distress
help
the
poor
harper
sisters
brothers
who
loves
to
give
alone
is
gay
this
day
a
holiday
to
others
make
it
for
me
a
harvest
day
sundays
and
holidays
i
like
of
all
things
a
good
prattle
of
war
and
fighting
and
the
whole
array
when
back
in
turkey
far
away
the
peoples
give
each
other
battle
one
stands
before
the
window
drinks
his
glass
and
sees
the
ships
with
flags
glide
slowly
down
the
river
comes
home
at
night
when
out
of
sight
they
pass
and
sings
with
joy
oh
peace
forever
so
i
say
neighbor
let
them
have
their
way
crack
skulls
and
in
their
crazy
riot
turn
all
things
upside
down
they
may
but
leave
us
here
in
peace
and
quiet
the
citizen
heyday
brave
prinking
this
the
fine
young
blood
who
is
not
smitten
that
has
met
you
but
not
so
proud
all
very
good
and
what
you
want
i
promise
soon
to
get
you
come
agatha
i
dread
in
public
sight
to
prattle
with
such
hags
do
stay
o
luddy
is
true
she
showed
me
on
andrew
night
my
future
sweetheart
in
the
body
she
showed
me
mine
too
in
a
glass
right
soldierlike
with
daring
comrades
round
him
i
look
all
round
i
study
all
that
pass
but
to
this
hour
i
have
not
found
him
castles
with
lowering
bulwarks
and
towers
maidens
with
towering
passions
and
powers
both
shall
be
ours
daring
the
venture
glorious
the
pay
when
the
brass
trumpet
summons
us
loudly
or
on
we
march
proudly
that
is
a
storming
life
in
its
splendor
castles
and
maidens
both
must
surrender
daring
the
venture
glorious
the
pay
there
go
the
soldiers
marching
away
faust
wagner
spring
warm
look
has
unfettered
the
fountains
brooks
go
tinkling
with
silvery
feet
hope
bright
blossoms
the
valley
greet
weakly
and
sickly
up
the
rough
mountains
pale
old
winter
has
made
his
retreat
thence
he
launches
in
sheer
despite
sleet
and
hail
in
impotent
showers
the
green
lawn
as
he
takes
his
flight
but
the
sun
will
suffer
no
white
everywhere
waking
the
formative
powers
living
colors
he
yearns
to
spread
yet
as
he
finds
it
too
early
for
flowers
gayly
dressed
people
he
takes
instead
look
from
this
height
whereon
we
find
us
back
to
the
town
we
have
left
behind
us
where
from
the
dark
and
narrow
door
forth
a
motley
multitude
pour
they
sun
themselves
gladly
and
all
are
gay
they
celebrate
christ
resurrection
for
have
not
they
themselves
arisen
from
smoky
huts
and
hovels
and
stables
from
labor
bonds
and
traffic
prison
from
the
confinement
of
roofs
and
gables
from
many
a
cramping
street
and
alley
from
churches
full
of
the
old
world
night
all
have
come
out
to
the
day
broad
light
see
only
see
how
the
masses
sally
streaming
and
swarming
through
gardens
and
fields
how
the
broad
stream
that
bathes
the
valley
is
everywhere
cut
with
pleasure
boats
keels
and
that
last
skiff
so
heavily
laden
almost
to
sinking
puts
off
in
the
stream
ribbons
and
jewels
of
youngster
and
maiden
from
the
far
paths
of
the
mountain
gleam
how
it
hums
the
fields
and
clangs
from
the
steeple
this
is
the
real
heaven
of
the
people
both
great
and
little
are
merry
and
gay
i
am
a
man
too
i
can
be
with
you
sir
doctor
to
go
out
walking
is
at
all
times
honor
and
gain
enough
but
to
trust
myself
here
alone
would
be
shocking
for
i
am
a
foe
to
all
that
is
rough
fiddling
and
bowling
and
screams
and
laughter
to
me
are
the
hatefullest
noises
on
earth
they
yell
as
if
satan
himself
were
after
and
call
it
music
and
call
it
mirth
under
the
linden
dance
and
the
shepherd
prinked
him
for
the
dance
with
jacket
gay
and
spangle
glance
and
all
his
finest
quiddle
and
round
the
linden
lass
and
lad
they
wheeled
and
whirled
and

this
glad
day
we
take
it
very
kind
indeed
in
truth
we
found
you
long
ere
this
in
evil
days
a
friend
in
need
full
many
a
one
stands
living
here
whom
at
death
door
already
laid
your
father
snatched
from
fever
rage
when
by
his
skill
the
plague
he
stayed
you
a
young
man
we
daily
saw
go
with
him
to
the
then
and
many
a
corpse
was
carried
forth
but
you
came
out
alive
again
with
a
charmed
life
you
passed
before
us
helped
by
the
helper
watching
us
the
man
and
may
he
live
long
years
a
helping
hand
to
give
bow
down
to
him
on
high
who
sends
his
heavenly
help
and
helping
friends
goes
on
wagner
what
feelings
o
great
man
thy
heart
must
swell
thus
to
receive
a
people
veneration
o
worthy
all
congratulation
whose
gifts
to
such
advantage
tell
the
father
to
his
son

thee
with
exultation

and

and

the

the
dancers
pause
thou
goest
the
lines
fall
back
for
thee
they
fling
their
caps
on
high
a
little
more
and
they
would
bow
the
knee
as
if
the
blessed
host
came
by
a
few
steps
further
on
until
we
reach
that
stone
there
will
we
rest
us
from
our
wandering
how
oft
in
prayer
and
penance
there
alone
fasting
i
sate
on
holy
mysteries
pondering
there
rich
in
hope
in
faith
still
firm
i
wept
sighed
wrung
my
hands
and
striven
this
plague
removal
to
extort
poor
worm
from
the
almighty
lord
of
heaven
the
crowd
applause
has
now
a
scornful
tone
o
couldst
thou
hear
my
conscience
tell
its
story
how
little
either
sire
or
son
has
done
to
merit
such
a
glory
my
father
was
a
worthy
man
confused
and
darkened
with
his
narrow
lucubrations
who
with
a
whimsical
though
patience
on
nature
holy
circles
mused
shut
up
in
his
black
laboratory
experimenting
without
end
his
adepts
till
he
grew
hoary
he
sought
the
opposing
powers
to
blend
thus
a
red
lion
a
bold
suitor
married
the
silver
lily
in
the
lukewarm
bath
and
from
one
to
another
harried
the
two
were
seen
to
fly
before
the
flaming
wrath
if
then
with
colors
gay
and
splendid
the
glass
the
youthful
queen
revealed
here
was
the
physic
death
the
patients
sufferings
ended
and
no
one
asked
who
then
was
healed
thus
with
electuaries
so
satanic
worse
than
the
plague
with
all
its
panic
we
rioted
through
hill
and
vale
myself
with
my
own
hands
the
drug
to
thousands
giving
they
passed
away
and
i
am
living
to
hear
men
thanks
the
murderers
hail
forbear
far
other
name
that
service
merits
can
a
brave
man
do
more
or
less
than
with
nice
conscientiousness
to
exercise
the
calling
he
inherits
if
thou
as
youth
thy
father
honorest
to
learn
from
him
thou
wilt
desire
if
thou
as
man
men
with
new
light
hast
blest
then
may
thy
son
to
loftier
heights
aspire
o
blest
who
hopes
to
find
repose
up
from
this
mighty
sea
of
error
diving
man
can
not
use
what
he
already
knows
to
use
the
unknown
ever
striving
but
let
not
such
dark
thoughts
a
shadow
throw
the
bright
joy
this
hour
inspires
see
how
the
setting
sun
with
ruddy
glow
the
hamlet
fires
he
sinks
and
fades
the
day
is
lived
and
gone
he
hastens
forth
new
scenes
of
life
to
waken
o
for
a
wing
to
lift
and
bear
me
on
and
on
to
where
his
last
rays
beckon
then
should
i
see
the
world
calm
breast
in
everlasting
sunset
glowing
the
summits
all
on
fire
each
valley
steeped
in
rest
the
silver
brook
to
golden
rivers
flowing
no
savage
mountain
climbing
to
the
skies
should
stay
the
godlike
course
with
wild
abysses
and
now
the
sea
with
sheltering
warm
recesses
spreads
out
before
the
astonished
eyes
at
last
it
seems
as
if
the
god
were
sinking
but
a
new
impulse
fires
the
mind
onward
i
speed
his
endless
glory
drinking
the
day
before
me
and
the
night
behind
the
heavens
above
my
head
and
under
me
the
ocean
a
lovely
dream
meanwhile
he
gone
from
sight
ah
sure
no
earthly
wing
in
swiftest
flight
may
with
the
spirit
wings
hold
equal
motion
yet
has
each
soul
an
inborn
feeling
impelling
it
to
mount
and
soar
away
when
lost
in
heaven
blue
depths
the
lark
is
pealing
high
overhead
her
airy
lay
when
the
mountain
pine
black
shadow
with
outspread
wing
the
eagle
sweeps
and
steering
on
lake
and
meadow
the
crane
his
homeward
journey
keeps
i
had
myself
full
many
a
wayward
hour
but
never
yet
felt
such
a
passion
power
one
soon
grows
tired
of
field
and
wood
and
brook
i
envy
not
the
fowl
of
heaven
his
pinions
far
nobler
joy
to
soar
through
thought
dominions
from
page
to
page
from
book
to
book
ah
winter
nights
so
dear
to
mind
and
soul
warm
blissful
life
through
all
the
limbs
is
thrilling
and
when
thy
hands
unfold
a
genuine
ancient
scroll
it
seems
as
if
all
heaven
the
room
were
filling
one
passion
only
has
thy
heart
possessed
the
other
friend
o
learn
it
never
two
souls
alas
are
lodged
in
my
wild
breast
which
evermore
opposing
ways
endeavor
the
one
lives
only
on
the
joys
of
time
still
to
the
world
with
organs
clinging
the
other
leaves
this
earthly
dust
and
slime
to
fields
of
sainted
sires
o
are
there
spirits
in
the
air
that
empire
hold
earth
and
heaven
dominions
down
from
your
realm
of
golden
haze
repair
waft
me
to
new
rich
life
upon
your
rosy
pinions
ay
were
a
magic
mantle
only
mine
to
soar
earth
wide
wildernesses
i
would
not
sell
it
for
the
costliest
dresses
not
for
a
royal
robe
the
gift
resign
o
call
them
not
the
well
known
powers
of
air
that
swarm
through
all
the
middle
kingdom
weaving
their
fairy
webs
with
many
a
fatal
snare
the
feeble
race
of
men
deceiving
first
the
sharp
from
out
the
north
and
arrowy
tongues
and
fangs
come
thickly
flying
then
from
the
east
they
greedily
dart
forth
sucking
thy
lungs
thy
drying
if
from
the
south
they
come
with
fever
thirst
upon
thy
head
noon
fiery
splendors
heaping
the
westwind
brings
a
swarm
refreshing
first
then
all
thy
world
with
thee
in
stupor
steeping
they
listen
gladly
aye
on
mischief
bent
gladly
draw
near
each
weak
point
to
espy
they
make
believe
that
they
from
heaven
are
sent
whispering
like
angels
while
they
lie
but
let
us
go
the
earth
looks
gray
my
friend
the
air
grows
cool
the
mists
ascend
at
night
we
learn
our
homes
to
why
dost
thou
stop
and
stare
with
all
thy
eyes
what
can
so
chain
thy
sight
there
in
the
gloaming
seest
thou
that
black
dog
through
stalks
and
stubble
roaming
i
saw
him
some
time
since
he
seemed
not
strange
to
me
look
sharply
what
dost
take
the
beast
to
be
for
some
poor
poodle
who
has
lost
his
master
and
scents
him
the
ground
markst
thou
how
ever
nearer
ever
faster
towards
us
his
spiral
track
wheels
round
and
round
and
if
my
senses
suffer
no
confusion
behind
him
trails
a
fiery
glare
is
probably
an
optical
illusion
i
still
see
only
a
black
poodle
there
he
seems
to
me
as
he
were
tracing
slyly
his
magic
rings
our
feet
at
last
to
snare
to
me
he
seems
to
dart
around
our
steps
so
shyly
as
if
he
said
is
one
of
them
my
master
there
the
circle
narrows
he
is
near
thou
seest
a
dog
we
have
no
spectre
here
he
growls
and
stops
crawls
on
his
belly
too
and
wags
his
tail
as
all
dogs
do
come
here
sir
come
our
comrade
be
he
has
a
poodle
drollery
stand
still
and
he
too
waits
to
see
speak
to
him
and
he
jumps
on
thee
lose
something
drop
thy
cane
or
sling
it
into
the
stream
he
run
and
bring
it
i
think
you
right
i
trace
no
spirit
here
all
the
fruit
of
training
that
is
clear
a
dog
is
a
great
treasure
wise
men
in
such
will
oft
take
pleasure
and
he
deserves
your
favor
and
a
collar
he
of
the
students
the
accomplished
scholar
go
in
through
the
town
faust
poodle
i
leave
behind
me
field
and
meadow
veiled
in
the
dusk
of
holy
night
whose
ominous
and
awful
shadow
awakes
the
better
soul
to
light
to
sleep
are
lulled
the
wild
desires
the
hand
of
passion
lies
at
rest
the
love
of
man
the
bosom
fires
the
love
of
god
stirs
up
the
breast
be
quiet
poodle
what
worrisome
fiend
hath
possest
thee
nosing
and
snuffling
so
round
the
door
go
behind
the
stove
there
and
rest
thee
there
my
best
pillow
what
wouldst
thou
more
as
out
on
the
frisking
and
leaping
thou
to
amuse
us
hast
done
thy
best
so
now
in
return
lie
still
in
my
keeping
a
quiet
contented
and
welcome
guest
when
in
our
narrow
chamber
nightly
the
friendly
lamp
begins
to
burn
then
in
the
bosom
thought
beams
brightly
homeward
the
heart
will
then
return
reason
once
more
bids
passion
ponder
hope
blooms
again
and
smiles
on
man
back
to
life
rills
he
yearns
to
wander
ah
to
the
source
where
life
began
stop
growling
poodle
in
the
music
elysian
that
laps
my
soul
at
this
holy
hour
these
bestial
noises
have
jarring
power
we
know
that
men
will
treat
with
derision
whatever
they
can
not
understand
at
goodness
and
truth
and
beauty
vision
will
shut
their
eyes
and
murmur
and
howl
at
it
and
must
the
dog
too
snarl
and
growl
at
it
but
ah
with
the
best
will
i
feel
already
no
peace
will
well
up
in
me
clear
and
steady
but
why
must
hope
so
soon
deceive
us
and
the
stream
in
fever
leave
us
for
in
this
i
have
had
a
full
probation
and
yet
for
this
want
a
supply
is
provided
to
a
higher
than
earth
the
soul
is
guided
we
are
ready
and
yearn
for
revelation
and
where
are
its
light
and
warmth
so
blent
as
here
in
the
new
testament
i
feel
this
moment
a
mighty
yearning
to
expound
for
once
the
ground
text
of
all
the
venerable
original
into
my
own
loved
german
honestly
turning
opens
the
volume
and
applies
himself
to
the
in
the
beginning
was
the
i
read
but
here
i
stick
who
helps
me
to
proceed
the
so
high
i
can
not
dare
not
rate
it
i
must
then
otherwise
translate
it
if
by
the
spirit
i
am
rightly
taught
it
reads
in
the
beginning
was
the
but
study
well
this
first
line
lesson
nor
let
thy
pen
to
error
overhasten
is
it
the
does
all
from
time
first
hour
in
the
beginning
read
then
was
the
yet
even
while
i
write
it
down
my
finger
is
checked
a
voice
forbids
me
there
to
linger
the
spirit
helps
at
once
i
dare
to
read
and
write
in
the
beginning
was
the
if
i
with
thee
must
share
my
chamber
poodle
now
remember
no
more
howling
no
more
growling
i
had
as
lief
a
bull
should
bellow
as
have
for
a
chum
such
a
noisy
fellow
stop
that
yell
now
one
of
us
must
quit
this
cell
now
is
hard
to
retract
hospitality
but
the
door
is
open
thy
way
is
free
but
what
ails
the
creature
is
this
in
the
course
of
nature
is
it
real
or
one
of
fancy
shows
how
long
and
broad
my
poodle
grows
he
rises
from
the
ground
that
is
no
longer
the
form
of
a
hound
heaven
avert
the
curse
from
us
he
looks
like
a
hippopotamus
with
his
fiery
eyes
and
the
terrible
white
of
his
grinning
teeth
oh
what
a
fright
have
i
brought
with
me
into
the
house
ah
now
no
mystery
art
thou
methinks
for
such
half
hellish
brood
the
key
of
solomon
were
good
the
softly
a
fellow
is
caught
there
keep
back
all
of
you
follow
him
not
there
like
the
fox
in
the
trap
mourns
the
old
his
mishap
but
give
ye
good
heed
this
way
hover
that
way
hover
over
and
over
and
he
shall
right
soon
be
freed
help
can
you
give
him
o
do
not
leave
him
many
good
turns
he
done
us
many
a
fortune
won
us

why
all
this
noise
what
is
your
worship
pleasure
this
was
the
poodle
essence
then
a
travelling
clark
ha
ha
the
casus
is
too
funny
i
bow
to
the
most
learned
among
men
you
did
sweat
me
without
ceremony
what
is
thy
name
the
question
seems
too
small
for
one
who
holds
the
so
very
cheaply
who
far
removed
from
shadows
all
for
substances
alone
seeks
deeply
with
gentlemen
like
him
in
my
presence
the
name
is
apt
to
express
the
essence
especially
if
when
you
inquire
you
find
it
god
of
flies
destroyer
slanderer
liar
well
now
who
art
thou
then
a
portion
of
that
power
which
wills
the
bad
and
works
the
good
at
every
hour
beneath
thy
what
meaning
lies
i
am
the
spirit
that
denies
and
justly
so
for
all
that
time
creates
he
does
well
who
annihilates
better
it
had
had
beginning
and
so
then
all
that
you
call
sinning
destruction
all
you
pronounce
is
my
original
element
thou
thyself
a
part
yet
lookst
complete
to
me
i
speak
the
modest
truth
to
thee
a
world
of
folly
in
one
little
soul
loves
to
think
himself
a
whole
part
of
the
part
am
i
which
once
was
all
the
gloom
that
brought
forth
light
itself
from
out
her
mighty
womb
the
upstart
proud
that
now
with
mother
night
disputes
her
ancient
rank
and
space
and
right
yet
never
shall
prevail
since
do
he
will
he
cleaves
a
slave
to
bodies
still
from
bodies
flows
makes
bodies
fair
to
sight
a
body
in
his
course
can
check
him
his
doom
i
therefore
hope
will
soon
him
with
bodies
merged
in
nothingness
and
night
ah
now
i
see
thy
high
vocation
in
gross
thou
canst
not
harm
creation
and
so
in
small
hast
now
begun
and
truth
to
tell
here
not
much
have
done
that
which
at
nothing
the
gauntlet
has
hurled
this
what
its
name
this
clumsy
world
so
far
as
i
have
undertaken
i
have
to
own
remains
unshaken
by
wave
storm
earthquake
fiery
brand
calm
after
all
remain
both
sea
and
land
and
the
damn
living
fluff
of
man
and
beast
the
brood
it
laughs
to
scorn
my
utmost
power
i
buried
myriads
by
the
hour
and
still
there
circulates
each
hour
a
new
fresh
blood
it
were
enough
to
drive
one
to
distraction
earth
water
air
in
constant
action
through
moist
and
dry
through
warm
and
cold
going
forth
in
endless
germination
had
i
not
claimed
of
fire
a
reservation
not
one
thing
i
alone
should
hold
thus
with
the
power
of
good
dost
thou
in
strife
persist
and
in
vain
malice
to
this
hour
clenchest
thy
cold
and
devilish
fist
go
try
some
other
occupation
singular
son
of
chaos
thou
we
give
the
thing
consideration
when
next
we
meet
again
but
now
might
i
for
once
with
leave
retire
why
thou
shouldst
ask
i
do
not
see
now
that
i
know
thee
when
desire
shall
prompt
thee
freely
visit
me
window
and
door
give
free
admission
at
least
there
left
the
chimney
flue
let
me
confess
there
one
small
prohibition
lies
on
thy
threshold
my
walking
through
the
does
that
delay
thee
the
pentagram
disturbs
thee
now
come
tell
me
son
of
hell
i
pray
thee
if
that
thee
then
how
enteredst
thou
shouldst
proceed
more
circumspectly
mark
well
the
figure
is
not
drawn
correctly
one
of
the
angles
is
the
outer
one
is
somewhat
open
dost
perceive
it
that
was
a
lucky
hit
believe
it
and
i
have
caught
thee
then
well
done
was
wholly
chance
i
quite
astounded
the
took
no
heed
as
through
the
door
he
bounded
the
case
looks
differently
now
the
can
leave
the
house
the
window
offers
free
emission
devils
and
ghosts
are
bound
by
this
condition
the
way
they
entered
in
they
must
come
out
allow
in
the
first
clause
we
free
yet
not
so
in
the
second
in
hell
itself
then
laws
are
reckoned
now
that
i
like
so
then
one
may
in
fact
conclude
a
binding
compact
with
you
gentry
whatever
promise
on
our
books
finds
entry
we
strictly
carry
into
act
but
hereby
hangs
a
grave
condition
of
this
we
talk
when
next
we
meet
but
for
the
present
i
entreat
most
urgently
your
kind
dismission
do
stay
but
just
one
moment
longer
then
tell
me
good
news
and
i
release
thee
let
me
go
now
i
soon
come
back
again
then
thou
ask
shall
please
thee
i
laid
no
snare
for
thee
old
chap
thou
shouldst
have
watched
and
saved
thy
bacon
who
has
the
devil
in
his
trap
must
hold
him
fast
next
time
he
not
so
soon
be
taken
well
if
it
please
thee
i
content
to
stay
for
company
on
one
condition
that
i
for
thy
amusement
may
to
exercise
my
arts
have
free
permission
i
gladly
grant
it
if
they
be
not
disagreeable
to
me
thy
senses
friend
in
this
one
hour
shall
grasp
the
world
with
clearer
power
than
in
a
year
monotony
the
songs
the
tender
spirits
sing
thee
the
lovely
images
they
bring
thee
are
not
an
idle
magic
play
thou
shalt
enjoy
the
daintiest
savor
then
feast
thy
taste
on
richest
flavor
then
thy
charmed
heart
shall
melt
away
come
all
are
here
and
all
have
been
well
trained
and
practised
now
begin
vanish
ye
gloomy
vaulted
abysses
tenderer
clearer
friendlier
nearer
ether
look
through
o
that
the
darkling
were
riven
starlight
is
sparkling
purer
is
heaven
holier
sunshine
softens
the
blue
graces
adorning
sons
of
the
morning
shadowy
wavings
float
along
over
yearnings
and
cravings
after
them
hover
garments
ethereal
tresses
aerial
float
the
flowers
float
the
bowers
where
with
deep
feeling
thoughtful
and
tender
lovers
embracing
are
sealing
bowers
on
bowers
graceful
and
slender
vines
interlacing
purple
and
blushing
under
the
crushing
gushing
down
over
gleaming
precious
stones
streaming
leaves
the
bright
glowing
tops
of
the
mountains
leaves
the
red
fountains
widening
and
rushing
till
it
encloses
green
hills
all
flushing
laden
with
roses
happy
ones
swarming
ply
their
swift
pinions
glide
through
the
charming
airy
dominions
sunward
still
fleering
onward
where
peering
far
the
ocean
islets
are
dancing
with
an
entrancing
magical
motion
hear
them
in
chorus
singing
high
us
over
the
meadows
flit
the
bright
shadows
glad
eyes
are
glancing
tiny
feet
dancing
up
the
high
ridges
some
of
them
clamber
others
are
skimming
of
amber
others
are
swimming
over
the
ocean
all
are
in
motion
all
yearning
longingly
turning
to
the
of
bliss
he
sleeps
ye
airy
tender
youths
your
numbers
have
sung
him
into
sweetest
slumbers
you
put
me
greatly
in
your
debt
by
this
thou
art
not
yet
the
man
that
shall
hold
fast
the
devil
still
cheat
his
senses
with
your
magic
revel
drown
him
in
dreams
of
endless
youth
but
this
on
the
sill
to
level
i
need
o
rat
thy
pointed
tooth
nor
need
i
conjure
long
they
near
me
now
comes
scampering
one
who
presently
will
hear
me
the
sovereign
lord
of
rats
and
mice
of
flies
and
frogs
and
bugs
and
lice
commands
thee
to
come
forth
this
hour
and
gnaw
this
threshold
with
great
power
as
he
with
oil
the
same
shall
smear
ha
with
a
skip
now
here
but
brisk
to
work
the
point
by
which
i
cowered
is
on
the
ledge
the
farthest
forward
yet
one
more
bite
the
deed
is
now
faust
until
we
meet
again
dream
on
again
has
witchcraft
triumphed
me
was
it
a
ghostly
show
so
soon
withdrawn
i
dream
the
devil
stands
himself
before
me
wake
to
find
a
poodle
gone
faust
mephistopheles
a
knock
walk
in
who
comes
again
to
tease
me
is
i
come
in
must
say
it
thrice
to
please
me
come
in
then
that
i
like
to
hear
we
shall
i
hope
bear
with
each
other
for
to
dispel
thy
crotchets
brother
as
a
young
lord
i
now
appear
in
scarlet
dress
trimmed
with
gold
lacing
a
stiff
silk
cloak
with
stylish
facing
a
tall
cock
feather
in
my
hat
a
long
sharp
rapier
to
defend
me
and
i
advise
thee
short
and
flat
in
the
same
costume
to
attend
me
if
thou
wouldst
unembarrassed
see
what
sort
of
thing
this
life
may
be
in
every
dress
i
well
may
feel
the
sore
of
this
low
melancholy
i
am
too
old
to
live
for
folly
too
young
to
wish
for
nothing
more
am
i
content
with
all
creation
renounce
renounce
renunciation
such
is
the
everlasting
song
that
in
the
ears
of
all
men
rings
which
every
hour
our
whole
life
long
with
brazen
accents
hoarsely
sings
with
terror
i
behold
each
morning
light
with
bitter
tears
my
eyes
are
filling
to
see
the
day
that
shall
not
in
its
flight
fulfil
for
me
one
wish
not
one
but
killing
every
presentiment
of
zest
with
wayward
skepticism
chases
the
fair
creations
from
my
breast
with
all
life
thousand
cold
grimaces
and
when
at
night
i
stretch
me
on
my
bed
and
darkness
spreads
its
shadow
me
no
rest
comes
then
anigh
my
weary
head
wild
dreams
and
spectres
dance
before
me
the
god
who
dwells
within
my
soul
can
heave
its
depths
at
any
hour
who
holds
all
my
faculties
control
has
the
outer
world
no
power
existence
lies
a
load
upon
my
breast
life
is
a
curse
and
death
a
rest
and
yet
death
never
proves
a
wholly
welcome
guest
o
blest
for
whom
when
victory
joy
fire
blazes
death
round
his
brow
the
bloody
laurel
windeth
whom
weary
with
the
dance
mazes
he
on
a
maiden
bosom
findeth
o
that
beneath
the
exalted
spirit
power
i
had
expired
in
rapture
sinking
and
yet
i
knew
one
in
a
midnight
hour
who
a
brown
liquid
shrank
from
drinking
seems
a
favorite
game
with
thee
omniscient
am
i
not
yet
much
is
known
to
me
since
that
sweet
tone
with
fond
appealing
drew
me
from
witchcraft
horrid
maze
and
woke
the
lingering
childlike
feeling
with
harmonies
of
happier
days
my
curse
on
all
the
that
weave
their
spell
around
the
soul
and
bind
it
with
their
incantations
and
orgies
to
this
wretched
hole
accursed

the
high
opinion
hugged
by
the
mind
accursed
all
the
that
makes
the
dazzled
senses
blind

each
vision
that
befools
us
of
fame
outlasting
earthly
life

us

fires
our
hearts
for
deeds
of

idle
pleasure

our
pillow

my
curses

of
all
of
woe
woe
thou
hast
ground
it
to
dust

beautiful
world

blow

done
it
a
moment

look
upon
it

build
it
again

up
in
thy
breast
anew
a
fresh
career

before
thee
a
clearer
view
and
from
the
empyréan
a
paean
shall
greet
thee
too
be
pleased
to
admire
my
juvenile
choir
hear
how
they
counsel
in
manly
measure
action
and
pleasure
out
into
life
its
joy
and
strife
away
from
this
lonely
hole
where
senses
and
soul
rot
in
stagnation
calls
thee
their
high
invitation
give
over
toying
with
thy
sorrow
which
like
a
vulture
feeds
upon
thy
heart
thou
shalt
in
the
worst
company
feel
that
with
men
a
man
thou
art
yet
i
do
not
exactly
intend
among
the
canaille
to
plant
thee
i
none
of
your
magnates
i
grant
thee
yet
if
thou
art
willing
my
friend
through
life
to
jog
on
beside
me
thy
pleasure
in
all
things
shall
guide
me
to
thee
will
i
bind
me
a
friend
thou
shalt
find
me
and
to
the
grave
shalt
make
me
thy
servant
make
me
thy
slave
and
in
return
what
service
shall
i
render
there
ample
grace
no
hurry
not
the
least
no
no
the
devil
is
an
egotist
and
does
not
easily
for
god
sake
tender
that
which
a
neighbor
may
assist
speak
plainly
the
conditions
come
is
dangerous
taking
such
a
servant
home
i
to
thy
service
agree
to
bind
me
to
run
and
never
rest
at
call
of
thee
when
thou
shalt
find
me
then
thou
shalt
do
as
much
for
me
i
care
not
much
what
over
yonder
when
thou
hast
knocked
this
world
asunder
come
if
it
will
the
other
may
up
from
this
earth
my
pleasures
all
are
streaming
down
on
my
woes
this
earthly
sun
is
beaming
let
me
but
end
this
fit
of
dreaming
then
come
what
will
i
nought
to
say
i
hear
no
more
of
barren
wonder
if
in
that
world
they
hate
and
love
and
whether
in
that
future
yonder
there
a
below
and
an
above
in
such
a
mood
thou
well
mayst
venture
bind
thyself
to
me
and
by
this
indenture
thou
shalt
enjoy
with
relish
keen
fruits
of
my
arts
that
man
had
never
seen
and
what
hast
thou
to
give
poor
devil
was
a
human
mind
upon
its
lofty
level
conceived
of
by
the
like
of
thee
yet
hast
thou
food
that
brings
satiety
not
satisfaction
gold
that
reftlessly
like
quicksilver
melts
down
within
the
hands
a
game
in
which
men
never
win
a
maid
that
hanging
on
my
breast
ogles
a
neighbor
with
her
wanton
glances
of
fame
the
glorious
godlike
zest
that
like
a
meteor
dances
show
me
the
fruit
that
ere
it
plucked
will
rot
and
trees
from
which
new
green
is
daily
peeping
such
a
requirement
scares
me
not
such
treasures
have
i
in
my
keeping
yet
shall
there
also
come
a
time
good
friend
when
we
may
feast
on
good
things
at
our
leisure
if
i
lie
content
upon
a
lounge
of
pleasure
then
let
there
be
of
me
an
end
when
thou
with
flattery
canst
cajole
me
till
i
shall
be
when
thou
with
pleasure
canst
befool
me
be
that
the
last
of
days
for
me
i
lay
the
wager
done
and
heartily
whenever
to
the
passing
hour
i
cry
o
stay
thou
art
so
fair
to
chain
me
down
i
give
thee
power
to
the
black
bottom
of
despair
then
let
my
knell
no
longer
linger
then
from
my
service
thou
art
free
fall
from
the
clock
the
be
time
all
over
then
for
me
think
well
for
we
shall
hold
you
to
the
letter
full
right
to
that
just
now
i
gave
i
spoke
not
as
an
idle
braggart
better
henceforward
i
remain
a
slave
what
care
i
who
puts
on
the
setter
i
shall
this
very
day
at
my
bounden
service
duly
pay
thee
but
one
thing
for
insurance
sake
i
pray
thee
grant
me
a
line
or
two
at
least
pedant
will
writing
gain
thy
faith
alone
in
all
thy
life
no
man
nor
man
word
hast
thou
known
not
enough
that
i
the
fatal
word
that
passes
on
my
future
days
have
spoken
the
raves
and
rushes
hast
not
heard
and
shall
a
promise
hold
unbroken
yet
this
delusion
haunts
the
human
breast
who
from
his
soul
its
roots
would
sever
thrice
happy
in
whose
heart
pure
truth
finds
rest
no
sacrifice
shall
he
repent
of
ever
but
from
a
formal
written
sealed
attest
as
from
a
spectre
all
men
shrink
forever
the
word
and
spirit
die
together
killed
by
the
sight
of
wax
and
leather

this
rhetoric
of
thine
to
me
hath
a
somewhat
bombastic
savor
any
small
scrap
of
paper

thy
signature
will
need
a
single
drop
of
blood
if
this
will
satisfy
thy
mood
i

consent
thy
whim
to

quite
a
peculiar

i
shall
break
this
bond
o
never
my
promise

up

all

to
me
is
a
stupid
blunder
let
us
in
sensuality
deep
quench
the
passions
within
us
blazing
and
the
veil
of
sorcery
raising

from
its
long
sleep
plunge

into
the

the

now
once
for
all
pleasure
is
not
the
question
i
sworn
to
passion
whirl
the
agony
of
bliss
the
lover
hate
the
sweets
of
bitterness
my
heart
no
more
by
pride
of
science
driven
shall
open
wide
to
let
each
sorrow
enter
and
all
the
good
that
to
man
race
is
given
i
will
enjoy
it
to
my
being
centre
through
life
whole
range
upward
and
downward
sweeping
their
weal
and
woe
upon
my
bosom
heaping
thus
in
my
single
self
their
selves
all
comprehending
and
with
them
in
a
common
shipwreck
ending
o
trust
me
who
since
first
i
fell
from
heaven
have
chewed
this
tough
meat
many
a
thousand
year
no
man
digests
the
ancient
leaven
no
mortal
from
the
cradle
to
the
bier
trust
one
of
the
creation
to
god
alone
belongs
by
right
has
in
endless
day
his
habitation
he
hath
made
for
utter
night
for
alternate
dark
and
light
but
then
i
now
that
worth
hearing
but
one
thing
haunts
me
the
old
song
that
time
is
short
and
art
is
long
you
need
some
slight
advice
i
fearing
take
to
you
one
of
the
let
the
gentleman
thought
bring
all
the
noblest
traits
together
on
your
one
crown
their
honors
heaping
the
lion
mood
the
stag
rapidity
the
fiery
blood
of
italy
the
northman
hardihood
bid
him
teach
thee
the
art
of
combining
greatness
of
soul
with
fly
designing
and
how
with
warm
and
youthful
passion
to
fall
in
love
by
plan
and
fashion
should
like
myself
to
come
across
would
name
him
mr
microcosm
what
am
i
then
if
that
for
which
my
heart
yearns
with
invincible
endeavor
the
crown
of
man
must
hang
unreached
forever
thou
art
at
last
just
what
thou
art
pile
perukes
on
thy
head
whose
curls
can
not
be
counted
on
buskins
let
thy
feet
be
mounted
still
thou
art
only
what
thou
art
yes
i
have
vainly
let
me
not
deny
it
of
human
learning
ransacked
all
the
stores
and
when
at
last
i
set
me
down
in
quiet
there
gushes
up
within
no
force
i
am
not
by
a
higher
am
to
the
infinite
no
nigher
my
worthy
sir
you
see
the
matter
as
people
generally
see
but
we
must
learn
to
take
things
better
before
life
pleasures
wholly
flee
the
deuce
thy
head
and
all
that
in
it
hands
feet
and
are
thine
what
i
enjoy
with
zest
each
minute
is
surely
not
the
less
mine
if
i
six
horses
in
my
span
is
it
not
mine
their
every
power
i
fly
along
as
an
undoubted
man
on
four
and
twenty
legs
the
road
i
scour
cheer
up
then
let
all
thinking
be
and
out
into
the
world
with
me
i
tell
thee
friend
a
speculating
churl
is
like
a
beast
some
evil
spirit
chases
along
a
barren
heath
in
one
perpetual
whirl
while
round
about
lie
fair
green
pasturing
places
but
how
shall
we
begin
we
sally
forth
now
what
martyrdom
endurest
thou
what
kind
of
life
is
this
to
be
living
ennui
to
thyself
and
youngsters
giving
let
neighbor
belly
that
way
go
to
stay
here
threshing
straw
why
thou
the
best
that
thou
canst
think
and
know
to
tell
the
boys
not
for
the
whole
world
thou
now
i
hear
one
in
the
entry
i
have
no
heart
the
youth
to
see
the
poor
boy
waits
there
like
a
sentry
he
shall
not
want
a
word
from
me
come
give
me
now
thy
robe
and
bonnet
this
mask
will
suit
me
charmingly
puts
them
now
for
my
wit
rely
upon
it
take
but
fifteen
minutes
i
am
sure
meanwhile
prepare
thyself
to
make
the
pleasant
tour
faust
faust
only
despise
all
human
wit
and
lore
the
highest
flights
that
thought
can
soar
let
but
the
lying
spirit
blind
thee
and
with
his
spells
of
witchcraft
bind
thee
into
my
snare
the
victim
to
him
has
destiny
a
spirit
given
that
unrestrainedly
still
onward
sweeps
to
scale
the
skies
long
since
hath
striven
and
all
earth
pleasures
overleaps
he
shall
through
life
wild
scenes
be
driven
and
through
its
flat
unmeaningness
i
make
him
writhe
and
stare
and
stiffen
and
midst
all
sensual
excess
his
fevered
lips
with
thirst
all
parched
and
riven
insatiably
shall
haunt
refreshment
brink
and
had
he
not
himself
his
soul
to
satan
given
still
must
he
to
perdition
sink
a
scholar
i
have
but
lately
left
my
home
and
with
profound
submission
come
to
hold
with
one
some
conversation
whom
all
men
name
with
veneration
your
courtesy
greatly
flatters
me
a
man
like
many
another
you
see
have
you
made
any
applications
elsewhere
let
me
i
pray
your
teachings
share
with
all
good
dispositions
i
come
a
fresh
young
blood
and
money
some
my
mother
would
hardly
hear
of
my
going
but
i
long
to
learn
here
something
worth
knowing
you
come
to
the
very
place
for
it
then
sincerely
could
wish
i
were
off
again
my
soul
already
has
grown
quite
weary
of
walls
and
halls
so
dark
and
dreary
the
narrowness
oppresses
me
one
sees
no
green
thing
not
a
tree
on
the
i
know
not
what
ails
me
sight
hearing
thinking
every
thing
fails
me
is
all
in
use
we
daily
see
the
child
takes
not
the
mother
breast
in
the
first
instance
willingly
but
soon
it
feeds
itself
with
zest
so
you
at
wisdom
breast
your
pleasure
will
daily
find
in
growing
measure
i
hang
upon
her
neck
a
raptured
wooer
but
only
tell
me
who
shall
lead
me
to
her
ere
you
go
further
give
your
views
as
to
which
faculty
you
choose
to
be
right
learn
i
long
desired
and
of
the
natural
world
aspired
to
have
a
perfect
comprehension
in
this
and
in
the
heavenly
sphere
i
see
you
on
the
right
track
here
but
you
have
to
give
undivided
attention
my
heart
and
soul
in
the
work
be
found
only
of
course
it
would
give
me
pleasure
when
summer
holidays
come
round
to
have
for
amusement
a
little
leisure
use
well
the
precious
time
it
flips
away
so
yet
method
gains
you
time
if
i
may
say
so
i
counsel
you
therefore
my
worthy
friend
the
logical
leisures
first
to
attend
then
is
your
mind
well
trained
and
cased
in
spanish
boots
all
snugly
laced
so
that
henceforth
it
can
creep
ahead
on
the
road
of
thought
with
a
cautious
tread
and
not
at
random
shoot
and
strike
then
will
you
many
a
day
be
taught
that
what
you
once
to
do
had
thought
like
eating
and
drinking
extempore
requires
the
rule
of
one
two
three
it
is
to
be
sure
with
the
fabric
of
thought
as
with
the
by
weavers
wrought
where
a
thousand
threads
one
treadle
plies
backward
and
forward
the
shuttles
keep
going
invisibly
the
threads
keep
flowing
one
stroke
a
thousand
fastenings
ties
comes
the
philosopher
and
cries
i
show
you
it
could
not
be
otherwise
the
first
being
so
the
second
so
the
third
and
fourth
must
of
course
be
so
and
were
not
the
first
and
second
you
see
the
third
and
fourth
could
never
be
the
scholars
everywhere
call
this
clever
but
none
have
yet
become
weavers
ever
whoever
will
know
a
live
thing
and
expound
it
first
kills
out
the
spirit
it
had
when
he
found
it
and
then
the
parts
are
all
in
his
hand
minus
only
the
spiritual
band
encheiresin
naturæ
the
chemical
name
by
which
dunces
themselves
unwittingly
shame
can
not
entirely
comprehend
you
better
success
will
shortly
attend
you
when
you
learn
to
analyze
all
creation
and
give
it
a
proper
classification
i
feel
as
confused
by
all
you
said
as
if
a
going
round
in
my
head
the
next
thing
most
important
to
mention
metaphysics
will
claim
your
attention
there
see
that
you
can
clearly
explain
what
fits
not
into
the
human
brain
for
that
which
will
not
go
into
the
head
a
pompous
word
will
stand
you
in
stead
but
this
at
least
observe
from
regularity
never
to
swerve
you
have
five
lectures
every
day
be
in
at
the
stroke
of
the
bell
i
pray
and
well
prepared
in
every
part
study
each
paragraph
by
heart
so
that
you
scarce
may
need
to
look
to
see
that
he
says
no
more
than
in
the
book
and
when
he
dictates
be
at
your
post
as
if
you
wrote
for
the
holy
ghost
that
caution
is
unnecessary
i
know
it
profits
one
to
write
for
what
one
has
in
black
and
white
he
to
his
home
can
safely
carry
but
choose
some
faculty
i
pray
i
feel
a
strong
dislike
to
try
the
legal
college
i
can
not
blame
you
much
i
must
acknowledge
i
know
how
this
profession
stands
statutes
and
laws
through
all
the
ages
like
a
transmitted
malady
you
trace
in
every
generation
still
it
rages
and
softly
creeps
from
place
to
place
reason
is
nonsense
right
an
impudent
suggestion
alas
for
thee
that
thou
a
grandson
art
of
inborn
law
in
which
each
man
has
part
of
that
unfortunately
there
no
question
my
loathing
grows
beneath
your
speech
o
happy
he
whom
you
shall
teach
to
try
theology
i
almost
minded
i
must
not
let
you
by
zeal
be
blinded
this
is
a
science
through
whose
field
nine
out
of
ten
in
the
wrong
road
will
blunder
and
in
it
so
much
poison
lies
concealed
that
mould
you
this
mistake
for
physic
no
great
wonder
here
also
it
were
best
if
only
one
you
heard
and
swore
to
that
one
master
word
upon
the
whole
words
only
heed
you
these
through
the
temple
door
will
lead
you
safe
to
the
shrine
of
certainty
yet
in
the
word
a
thought
must
surely
be
all
right
but
one
must
not
perplex
himself
about
it
for
just
where
one
must
go
without
it
the
word
comes
in
a
friend
in
need
to
thee
with
words
can
one
dispute
most
featly
with
words
build
up
a
system
neatly
in
words
thy
faith
may
stand
unshaken
from
words
there
can
be
no
iota
taken
forgive
my
keeping
you
with
many
questions
yet
must
i
trouble
you
once
more
will
you
not
give
me
on
the
score
of
medicine
some
brief
suggestions
three
years
are
a
short
time
o
god
and
then
the
field
is
quite
too
broad
if
one
had
only
before
his
nose
something
else
as
a
hint
to
follow
i
heartily
tired
of
this
dry
prose
must
play
the
devil
again
out
hollow
the
healing
art
is
quickly
comprehended
through
great
and
little
world
you
look
abroad
and
let
it
wag
when
all
is
ended
as
pleases
god
vain
is
it
that
your
science
sweeps
the
skies
each
after
all
learns
only
what
he
can
who
grasps
the
moment
as
it
flies
he
is
the
real
man
your
person
somewhat
takes
the
eye
boldness
you
find
an
easy
science
and
if
you
on
yourself
rely
others
on
you
will
place
reliance
in
the
women
good
graces
seek
first
to
be
seated
their
oh
and
ah
well
known
of
old
so
are
all
from
a
single
point
to
be
treated
be
decently
modest
and
then
with
ease
you
may
get
the
blind
side
of
them
when
you
please
a
title
first
their
confidence
must
waken
that
art
many
another
art
transcends
then
may
you
lucky
man
on
all
those
trifles
reckon
for
which
another
years
of
groping
spends
know
how
to
press
the
little
pulse
that
dances
and
fearlessly
with
sly
and
fiery
glances
clasp
the
dear
creatures
round
the
waist
to
see
how
tightly
they
are
laced
this
promises
one
loves
the
how
and
where
to
see
gray
worthy
friend
is
all
your
theory
and
green
the
golden
tree
of
life
i
seem
i
swear
to
you
like
one
who
walks
in
dream
might
i
another
time
without
encroaching
hear
you
the
deepest
things
of
wisdom
broaching
so
far
as
i
have
power
you
may
i
can
not
tear
myself
away
till
i
to
you
my
album
have
presented
grant
me
one
line
and
i
contented
with
pleasure
and
returns
reads
eritis
sicut
deus
scientes
bonum
et
malum
it
reverently
and
bows
himself
let
but
the
brave
old
saw
and
my
aunt
the
serpent
guide
thee
and
with
thy
likeness
to
god
shall
woe
one
day
betide
thee
which
way
now
shall
we
go
which
way
it
pleases
thee
the
little
world
and
then
the
great
we
see
o
with
what
gain
as
well
as
pleasure
wilt
thou
the
rollicking
cursus
measure
i
fear
the
easy
life
and
free
with
my
long
beard
will
scarce
agree
is
vain
for
me
to
think
of
succeeding
i
never
could
learn
what
is
called
in
the
presence
of
others
i
feel
so
small
i
never
can
be
at
my
ease
at
all
dear
friend
vain
trouble
to
yourself
you
giving
whence
once
you
trust
yourself
you
know
the
art
of
living
but
how
are
we
to
start
i
pray
where
are
thy
servants
coach
and
horses
we
spread
the
mantle
and
away
it
bears
us
on
our
airy
courses
but
on
this
bold
excursion
thou
must
take
no
great
portmanteau
now
a
little
oxygen
which
i
will
soon
make
ready
from
earth
uplifts
us
quick
and
steady
and
if
we
light
we
soon
surmount
the
sphere
i
give
thee
hearty
joy
in
this
thy
new
career
auerbach

nobody

those
grimaces

teach
you
how
to
be

your

out
you
like

should
hear

strain
as
well
as

and
hear
a
song
join

the
chorus
loud
and
strong
a
rat

the
cellar

built
his
nest
he
daily
grew
sleeker
and
smoother
he
lined
his
paunch
from
larder
and

was
portly
as
doctor

the

had
set
him
poison
one
day
from
that
time
forward
he
pined
away
as
if
he
had
love
in
his
body
as
if
he
had
love
in
his
body
he
raced
about
with
a
terrible
touse
from
all
the
puddles
went
swilling
he
gnawed
and
he
scratched
all
over
the
house
his
pain
there
was
no
stilling
he
made
full
many
a
jump
of
distress
and
soon
the
poor
beast
got
enough
i
guess
as
if
he
had
love
in
his
body
as
if
he
had
love
in
his
body
with
pain
he
ran
in
open
day
right
up
into
the
kitchen
he
fell
on
the
hearth
and
there
he
lay
gasping
and
moaning
and
twitchin
then
laughed
the
poisoner
he
he
he
he
piping
on
the
last
hole
said
she
as
if
he
had
love
in
his
body
as
if
he
had
love
in
his
body
just
hear
now
how
the
ninnies
giggle
that
what
i
call
a
genuine
art
to
make
poor
rats
with
poison
wriggle
you
take
their
case
so
much
to
heart
the
bald
pate
and
the
the
sad
tale
makes
him
mild
and
tame
he
sees
in
the
swollen
rat
poor
fellow
his
own
true
likeness
set
in
a
frame
faust
mephistopheles
now
first
of
all
is
necessary
to
show
you
people
making
merry
that
you
may
see
how
lightly
life
can
run
each
day
to
this
small
folk
a
feast
of
fun
not
still
round
and
round
in
they
whirl
as
with
their
tails
young
kittens
twirl
if
with
no
headache
they
tormented
nor
dunned
by
landlord
for
his
pay
they
careless
unconcerned
and
gay
they
fresh
from
travel
one
might
know
it
their
air
and
manner
plainly
show
it
they
came
here
not
an
hour
ago
thou
verily
art
right
my
leipsic
well
i
know
paris
in
small
it
is
and
cultivates
its
people
what
do
the
strangers
seem
to
thee
just
let
me
go
when
wine
our
friendship
mellows
easy
as
drawing
a
child
tooth
be
to
worm
their
secrets
out
of
these
two
fellows
they
of
a
noble
house
i
dare
to
swear
they
have
a
proud
and
discontented
air
they
mountebanks
i
bet
a
dollar
perhaps
i
smoke
them
mark
you
that
these
people
never
smell
the
old
rat
when
he
has
them
by
the
collar
fair
greeting
to
you
sirs
the
same
and
thanks
to
boot
a
low
tone
faking
a
side
look
at
why
has
the
churl
one
halting
foot
with
your
permission
shall
we
make
one
party
instead
of
a
good
drink
which
get
here
no
one
can
good
company
must
make
us
hearty
you
seem
a
very
fastidious
man
i
think
you
spent
some
time
at
rippach
lately
you
supped
with
mister
hans
not
long
since
i
dare
say
we
passed
him
on
the
road
today
fine
man
it
grieved
us
parting
with
him
greatly
he
much
to
say
to
us
about
his
cousins
and
sent
to
each
through
us
his
compliments
by
dozens
bows
frosch
you
got
it
there
he
takes
the
chap
do
want
for
wit
i
have
him
next
time
wait
a
bit
if
i
mistook
not
did
we
hear
some
voices
chorus
singing
music
must
sound
finely
here
from
all
these
echoing
arches
ringing
you
are
perhaps
a
connoisseur
o
no
my
powers
are
small
i
but
an
amateur
give
us
a
song
as
many
you
desire
but
let
it
be
a
strain
no
fear
of
that
we
just
come
back
from
spain
the
lovely
land
of
wine
and
song
and
lyre
there
was
a
king
right
stately
who
had
a
great
big
flea
hear
him
a
flea
d
take
there
boys
a
flea
i
call
that
genteel
company
there
was
a
king
right
stately
who
had
a
great
big
flea
and
loved
him
very
greatly
as
if
his
own
son
were
he
he
called
the
knight
of
stitches
the
tailor
came
straightway
ho
measure
the
youngster
for
breeches
and
make
him
a
coat
but
do
forget
to
charge
the
knight
of
stitches
the
measure
carefully
to
take
and
as
he
loves
his
precious
neck
to
leave
no
wrinkles
in
the
breeches
in
silk
and
velvet
splendid
the
creature
now
was
drest
to
his
coat
were
ribbons
appended
a
cross
was
on
his
breast
he
had
a
great
star
on
his
collar
was
a
minister
in
short
and
his
relatives
greater
and
smaller
became
great
people
at
court
the
lords
and
ladies
of
honor
fared
worse
than
if
they
were
hung
the
queen
she
got
them
upon
her
and
all
were
bitten
and
stung
and
did
not
dare
to
attack
them
nor
scratch
but
let
them
stick
we
choke
them
and
we
crack
them
the
moment
we
feel
one
prick
we
choke
and
we
crack
the
moment
we
feel
one
prick
bravo
bravo
that
was
fine
so
shall
each
flea
his
life
resign
point
your
fingers
and
nip
them
fine
hurra
for
liberty
hurra
for
wine
i
pledge
the
goddess
too
to
show
how
high
i
set
her
right
gladly
if
your
wines
were
just
a
trifle
better
do
say
that
thing
again

fretter
did
i
not
fear
the
landlord
to
affront

these
worthy
guests

stock

in
it
just
bring
it
on
i
bear
the
brunt
give
us
a
brimming
glass
our
praise

then
be
ample
but
do
dole
out
too
small
a
sample
for
if
i
to
judge
and
criticize
i
need
a
good
mouthful
to
make
me
wise

way
to
make
thee
young
none

in
another
book
it
must
be
sought
and
is
a
quite
peculiar
chapter
i
beg
to
know
it
well
here
one
that

a
thousand
years
who

the
fools
would
waste
a

thinks
if
words

some
meaning
in

it
comes
unbidden
what
nonsense
is
she
talking
here
my
heart
is
on
the
point
of
cracking
in
one
great
choir
i
seem
to
hear
a
hundred
thousand

clacking
enough

safely
taken

reckon
many
good
swigs
have
entered
him

thee

afford
you
to
the
and
any
favor

may
ask
of

gladly
on
walpurgis
night

you
here
is
a
song
which
if
you
sometimes
sing
stir
up
in
your
heart
a
special
fire
to
only
make
haste
and
even
shouldst
thou
tire
still
follow
me
one
must
perspire
that
it
may
set
his
nerves
all
quivering
i
teach
thee
by
and
bye
to
prize
a
noble
leisure
and
soon
too
shalt
thou
feel
with
hearty
pleasure
how
busy
cupid
stirs
and
shakes
his
nimble
wing
but
first
one
look
in
yonder
glass
i
pray
thee
such
beauty
i
no
more
may
find
nay
in
the
flesh
thine
eyes
shall
soon
display
thee
the
model
of
all
soon
will
when
once
this
drink
shall
heat
thee
in
every
girl
a
helen
meet
thee
a
street
faust
margaret
my
fair
young
lady
will
it
offend
her
if
i
offer
my
arm
and
escort
to
lend
her
am
neither
lady
nor
yet
am
fair
can
find
my
way
home
without
any
one
care
herself
and
by
heavens
but
then
the
child
fair
i
never
seen
the
like
i
swear
so
modest
is
she
and
so
pure
and
somewhat
saucy
too
to
be
sure
the
light
of
the
cheek
the
lip
red
bloom
i
shall
never
forget
to
the
day
of
doom
how
me
cast
down
her
lovely
eyes
deep
in
my
soul
imprinted
lies
how
she
spoke
up
so
curt
and
tart
ah
that
went
right
to
my
ravished
heart
mephistopheles
hark
thou
shalt
find
me
a
way
to
address
her
which
one
she
just
went
by
what
she
she
came
just
now
from
her
father
confessor
who
from
all
sins
pronounced
her
free
i
stole
behind
her
noiselessly
an
innocent
thing
who
for
nothing
at
all
must
go
to
the
confessional
such
as
she
no
power
i
hold
but
then
she
over
fourteen
years
old
thou
exactly
like
jack
rake
who
every
fair
flower
his
own
would
make
and
thinks
there
can
be
no
favor
nor
fame
but
one
may
straightway
pluck
the
same
but
not
always
do
we
see
my
worthy
master
gravity
let
not
a
word
of
the
law
be
spoken
one
thing
be
clearly
understood
unless
i
clasp
the
sweet
young
blood
this
night
in
my
arms
then
well
and
good
when
midnight
strikes
our
bond
is
broken
reflect
on
all
that
lies
in
the
way
i
need
a
fortnight
at
least
to
a
day
for
finding
so
much
as
a
way
to
reach
her
had
i
seven
hours
to
call
my
own
without
the
devil
aid
alone
i
snare
with
ease
so
young
a
creature
you
talk
quite
but
do
be
vexed
beyond
all
measure
what
boots
it
thus
to
snatch
at
pleasure
is
not
so
great
by
a
long
way
as
if
you
first
with
tender
twaddle
and
every
sort
of
your
little
doll
should
mould
and
knead
as
one
in
french
romances
may
read
my
appetite
needs
no
such
spur
now
then
without
a
jest
or
slur
i
tell
you
once
for
all
such
speed
with
the
fair
creature
wo
succeed
nothing
will
here
by
storm
be
taken
we
must
perforce
on
intrigue
reckon
get
me
some
trinket
the
angel
has
blest
lead
me
to
her
chamber
of
rest
get
me
a
from
her
neck
a
garter
get
me
for
love
sweet
sake
to
prove
to
you
my
willingness
to
aid
and
serve
you
in
this
distress
you
shall
visit
her
chamber
by
me
attended
before
the
passing
day
is
ended
and
see
her
too
and
have
her
nay
she
will
to
a
neighbor
have
gone
away
meanwhile
alone
by
yourself
you
may
there
in
her
atmosphere
feast
at
leisure
and
revel
in
dreams
of
future
pleasure
shall
we
start
at
once
is
too
early
yet
some
present
to
take
her
for
me
you
must
get
presents
already
brave
he
on
the
right
foundation
full
many
a
noble
place
i
know
and
treasure
buried
long
ago
must
make
a
bit
of
exploration
evening
little
cleanly
margaret
and
tying
up
her
i
give
a
penny
just
to
say
what
gentleman
that
was
how
very
gallant
he
seemed
to
be
he
of
a
noble
family
that
i
could
read
from
his
brow
and
bearing
and
he
would
not
have
otherwise
been
so
daring
faust
mephistopheles
come
in
step
softly
do
not
fear
after
a
leave
me
alone
i
prithee
here
peering
not
every
maiden
keeps
so
neat
gazing
welcome
this
hallowed
still
retreat
where
twilight
weaves
its
magic
glow
seize
on
my
heart
sad
and
sweet
that
on
the
dew
of
hope
dost
feed
thy
woe
how
breathes
around
the
sense
of
stillness
of
quiet
order
and
content
in
all
this
poverty
what
fulness
what
blessedness
within
this
prison
pent
throws
himself
into
a
leathern
chair
by
the
take
me
too
as
thou
hast
in
years
long
flown
in
joy
and
grief
so
many
a
generation
ah
me
how
oft
on
this
ancestral
throne
have
troops
of
children
climbed
with
exultation
perhaps
when
christmas
brought
the
holy
guest
my
love
has
here
in
grateful
veneration
the
grandsire
withered
hand
with
prest
i
feel
o
maiden
circling
me
thy
spirit
of
grace
and
fulness
hover
which
daily
like
a
mother
teaches
thee
the
to
spread
in
snowy
purity
and
even
with
crinkled
sand
the
floor
to
cover
dear
godlike
hand
a
touch
of
thine
makes
this
low
house
a
heavenly
kingdom
slime
and
here
lifts
a
what
blissful
awe
my
heart
thrills
through
here
for
long
hours
could
i
linger
here
nature
in
light
dreams
thy
airy
finger
the
inborn
angel
features
drew
here
lay
the
child
when
life
fresh
heavings
its
tender
bosom
first
made
warm
and
here
with
pure
mysterious
weavings
the
spirit
wrought
its
godlike
form
and
thou
what
brought
thee
here
what
power
stirs
in
my
deepest
soul
this
hour
what
wouldst
thou
here
what
makes
thy
heart
so
sore
unhappy
faust
i
know
thee
thus
no
more
breathe
i
a
magic
atmosphere
the
will
to
enjoy
how
strong
i
felt
it
and
in
a
dream
of
love
am
now
all
melted
are
we
the
sport
of
every
puff
of
air
and
if
she
suddenly
should
enter
now
how
would
she
thy
presumptuous
folly
humble
big
ah
how
wouldst
thou
sink
at
her
feet
collapse
and
crumble
quick
now
she
comes
i
looking
at
her
away
away
o
cruel
fate
here
is
a
box
of
moderate
weight
i
got
it
somewhere
else
no
matter
just
shut
it
up
here
in
the
press
i
swear
to
you
turn
her
senses
i
meant
the
trifles
i
confess
to
scale
another
fair
one
fences
true
child
is
child
and
play
is
play
shall
i
i
know
not
why
delay
you
mean
perhaps
to
keep
the
bauble
if
so
i
counsel
you
to
spare
from
idle
passion
hours
so
fair
and
me
henceforth
all
further
trouble
i
hope
you
are
not
avaricious
i
rub
my
hands
i
scratch
my
head
places
the
casket
in
the
press
and
locks
it
up
quick
time
we
sped
that
the
dear
creature
may
be
led
and
moulded
by
your
will
and
wishes
and
you
stand
here
as
glum
as
one
at
the
door
of
the
auditorium
as
if
before
your
eyes
you
saw
in
bodily
shape
with
breathless
awe
metaphysics
and
physics
grim
and
gray
away
with
a
it
seems
so
close
so
sultry
here
opens
the
yet
it
is
so
very
warm
out
there
i
feel
i
know
not
how
oh
dear
i
wish
my
mother
come
home
i
declare
i
feel
a
shudder
all
over
me
crawl
i
a
silly
timid
thing
that
all
begins
to
sing
while
there
was
a
king
in
thulè
to
whom
when
near
her
grave
the
mistress
he
loved
so
truly
a
golden
goblet
gave
he
cherished
it
as
a
lover
he
drained
it
every
bout
his
eyes
with
tears
ran
over
as
oft
as
he
drank
thereout
and
when
he
found
himself
dying
his
towns
and
cities
he
told
naught
else
to
his
heir
denying
save
only
the
goblet
of
gold
his
knights
he
straightway
gathers
and
in
the
midst
sate
he
in
the
banquet
hall
of
the
fathers
in
the
castle
over
the
sea
there
stood
th
old
knight
of
liquor
and
drank
the
last
then
flung
the
holy
beaker
into
the
flood
below
he
saw
it
plunging
drinking
and
sinking
in
the
roar
his
eyes
in
death
were
sinking
he
never
drank
one
drop
more
opens
the
press
to
put
away
her
clothes
and
discovers
the
how
in
the
world
came
this
fine
casket
here
i
locked
the
press
i
very
clear
i
wonder
what
inside
dear
me
it
very
queer
perhaps
was
brought
here
as
a
pawn
in
place
of
something
mother
lent
here
is
a
little
key
hung
on
a
single
peep
i
sha
repent
what
here
good
gracious
only
see
i
never
saw
the
like
in
my
born
days
on
some
chief
festival
such
finery
might
on
some
noble
lady
blaze
how
would
this
chain
become
my
neck
whose
may
this
splendor
be
so
lonely
arrays
herself
in
it
and
steps
before
the
could
i
but
claim
the
only
a
different
figure
one
would
make
what
beauty
worth
to
thee
young
blood
may
all
be
very
well
and
good
what
then
is
half
for
pity
sake
they
praise
your
pretty
features
each
burns
for
gold
all
turns
on
gold
alas
for
us
poor
creatures
promenade
faust
up
and
down
in
mephistopheles
by
all
that
ever
was
jilted
by
all
the
infernal
fires
i
wish
i
knew
something
worse
to
curse
as
my
heart
desires
what
griping
pain
has
hold
of
thee
such
grins
saw
i
in
the
worst
oh
to
the
devil
i
give
myself
instanter
if
i
were
not
already
he
some
pin
loose
in
your
head
old
fellow
that
fits
you
like
a
madman
thus
to
bellow
just
think
the
pretty
toy
we
got
for
peg
a
priest
has
hooked
the
cursed
plague
i
the
thing
came
under
the
eye
of
the
mother
and
caused
her
a
dreadful
internal
pother
the
woman
scent
is
fine
and
strong
snuffles
over
her
all
day
long
and
knows
by
the
smell
of
an
article
plain
whether
the
thing
is
holy
or
profane
and
as
to
the
box
she
was
soon
aware
there
could
not
be
much
blessing
there
my
child
she
cried
unrighteous
gains
ensnare
the
soul
dry
up
the
veins
we
consecrate
it
to
god
mother
she
give
us
some
heavenly
manna
or

he
rolled
his
greedy

all
is
rightly
disposed
said

a
certainty
the

should

a
loss

and
woe

and
joy
must
have
each
other
describe
his
closing
hours
to
me
in
padua
lies
our
departed
brother
in
the
churchyard
of
anthony
in
a
cool
and
quiet
bed
lies
sleeping
in
a
sacred
spot
eternal
keeping
and
this
was
all
you
had
to
bring
me
all
but
one
weighty
grave
request
bid
her
when
i
am
dead
three
hundred
masses
sing
me
with
this
i
have
made
a
clean
pocket
and
breast
what
not
a
medal
pin
nor
stone
such
as
for
memory
sake
no
journeyman
will
lack
saved
in
the
bottom
of
his
sack
and
sooner
would
hunger
be
a
pauper
madam
your
case
is
hard
i
own
but
blame
him
not
he
squandered
a
copper
he
too
bewailed
his
faults
with
penance
sore
ay
and
his
wretched
luck
bemoaned
a
great
deal
more
alas
that
mortals
so
unhappy
prove
i
surely
will
for
him
pray
many
a
requiem
duly
you
worthy
of
a
spouse
this
moment
truly
you
are
a
child
a
man
might
love
it
not
yet
time
for
that
ah
no
if
not
a
husband
say
meanwhile
a
beau
it
is
a
choice
and
heavenly
blessing
such
a
dear
thing
to
one
bosom
pressing
with
us
the
custom
is
not
so
custom
or
not
it
happens
though
tell
on
i
slood
beside
his
bed
as
he
lay
dying
better
than
dung
it
was
somewhat
straw
but
then
he
died
as
christian
ought
and
found
an
unpaid
score
on
heaven
lying
how
must
i
hate
myself
he
cried
inhuman
so
to
forsake
my
business
and
my
woman
oh
the
remembrance
murders
me
would
she
might
still
forgive
me
this
side
heaven
the
dear
good
man
he
has
been
long
forgiven
but
god
knows
i
was
less
to
blame
than
she
a
lie
and
at
death
door
abominable
if
i
to
judge
of
men
am
able
he
surely
fibbed
while
passing
hence
ways
to
kill
time
he
said
be
sure
i
did
not
need
them
first
to
get
children
and
then
bread
to
feed
them
and
bread
too
in
the
widest
sense
and
even
to
eat
my
bit
in
peace
could
not
be
thought
on
has
he
all
faithfulness
all
love
so
far
forgotten
the
drudgery
by
day
and
night
not
so
he
thought
of
you
with
all
his
might
he
said
when
i
from
malta
went
away
for
wife
and
children
my
warm
prayers
ascended
and
heaven
so
far
our
cause
befriended
our
ship
a
turkish
cruiser
took
one
day
which
for
the
mighty
sultan
bore
a
treasure
then
valor
got
its
pay
and
i
too
who
received
but
my
just
measure
a
goodly
portion
bore
away
how
where
and
he
has
left
it
somewhere
buried
who
knows
which
way
by
the
four
winds
was
carried
he
chanced
to
take
a
pretty
damsel
eye
as
a
strange
sailor
he
through
naples
jaunted
all
that
she
did
for
him
so
tenderly
to
his
blessed
end
the
poor
man
haunted
the
scamp
his
children
thus
to
plunder
and
could
not
all
his
troubles
sore
arrest
his
vile
career
i
wonder
but
mark
his
death
wipes
off
the
score
were
i
in
your
place
now
good
lady
one
year
i
mourn
him
piously
and
look
about
meanwhiles
for
a
new
flame
already
ah
god
another
such
as
he
i
may
not
find
with
ease
on
this
side
heaven
few
such
kind
fools
as
this
dear
spouse
of
mine
only
to
roving
he
was
too
much
given
and
foreign
women
and
foreign
wine
and
that
accursed
game
of
dice
mere
trifles
these
you
need
not
heed
if
he
on
his
part
not
winked
at
in
you
an
occasional
freedom
i
swear
on
that
condition
too
i
would
myself
rings
with
you
the
gentleman
is
pleased
to
jest
now
i
see
it
now
high
time
i
stirred
she
take
the
very
devil
at
his
word
margery
how
is
it
with
your
heart
my
best
now
what
means
the
gentleman
thou
innocent
young
heart
ladies
farewell
farewell
but
quick
before
we
part
i
like
some
witness
vouching
truly
where
how
and
when
my
love
died
and
was
buried
duly
i
always
paid
to
order
great
attention
would
of
his
death
read
some
newspaper
mention
ay
my
dear
lady
in
the
mouths
of
two
good
witnesses
each
word
is
true
i
a
friend
a
fine
fellow
who
when
you
desire
will
render
on
oath
what
you
require
i
bring
him
here
o
pray
sir
do
and
this
young
lady
be
there
too
fine
boy
has
travelled
everywhere
and
all
politeness
to
the
fair
before
him
shame
my
face
must
cover
before
no
king
the
wide
world
over
behind
the
house
in
my
garden
at
leisure
we
wait
this
eve
the
gentlemen
pleasure
street
faust
mephistopheles
how
now
what
progress
will
come
right
ha
bravo
so
you
all
on
fire
full
soon
you
see
whom
you
desire
in
neighbor
martha
grounds
we
are
to
meet
tonight
that
woman
one
of
nature
picking
for
pandering
and
so
far
so
good
but
one
thing
we
must
do
well
one
good
turn
deserves
another
true
we
simply
make
a
solemn
deposition
that
her
lord
bones
are
laid
in
good
condition
in
holy
ground
at
padua
hid
from
view
that
wise
but
then
we
first
must
make
the
journey
thither
sancta
no
need
of
such
just
swear
and
ask
not
why
or
whether
if
that
the
best
you
have
the
plan
not
worth
a
feather
o
holy
man
now
that
just
you
in
all
thy
life
hast
never
to
this
hour
to
give
false
witness
taken
pains
have
you
of
god
the
world
and
all
that
it
contains
of
man
and
all
that
stirs
within
his
heart
and
brains
not
given
definitions
with
great
power
unscrupulous
breast
unblushing
brow
and
if
you
search
the
matter
clearly
knew
you
as
much
thereof
to
speak
sincerely
as
of
herr
schwerdtlein
death
confess
it
now
thou
always
wast
a
sophist
and
a
liar
ay
if
one
did
not
look
a
little
nigher
for
will
you
not
in
honor
befool
poor
margery
to
her
sorrow
and
all
the
oaths
of
true
love
borrow
and
from
the
heart
too
well
and
fair
then
there
be
talk
of
truth
unending
of
love
all
transcending
will
every
word
be
there
enough
it
will
if
for
the
passion
that
fills
and
thrills
my
being
frame
i
find
no
name
no
fit
expression
then
through
the
world
with
all
my
senses
ranging
seek
what
most
strongly
speaks
the
unchanging
and
call
this
glow
within
me
burning
infinite
endless
endless
yearning
is
that
a
devilish
lying
game
i
right
nathless
now
hark
to
me
this
once
i
pray
and
spare
my
lungs
old
fellow
whoever
be
right
and
has
a
tongue
to
bellow
is
sure
to
be
but
come
enough
of
swaggering
let
be
quit
for
thou
art
right
because
i
must
submit
garden
margaret
faust
martha
mephistopheles
up
and
the
gentleman
but
makes
me
more
confused
with
all
his
condescending
goodness
men
who
have
travelled
wide
are
used
to
bear
with
much
from
dread
of
rudeness
i
know
too
well
a
man
of
so
much
mind
in
my
poor
talk
can
little
pleasure
find
one
look
from
thee
one
word
delights
me
more
than
this
world
wisdom
and
her
do
take
that
trouble
sir
how
could
you
bear
to
kiss
it
a
hand
so
ugly
coarse
and
rough
how
much
i
had
to
do
must
i
confess
it
mother
is
more
than
close
enough
pass
and
you
sir
are
you
always
travelling
so
alas
that
business
forces
us
to
do
it
with
what
regret
from
many
a
place
we
go
though
tenderest
bonds
may
bind
us
to
it
do
in
youth
tumultuous
maze
to
wander
round
the
world
a
careless
rover
but
soon
will
come
the
evil
days
and
then
a
lone
dry
stick
on
the
grave
brink
to
hover
for
that
nobody
ever
prays
the
distant
prospect
shakes
my
reason
then
worthy
sir
bethink
yourself
in
season
pass
yes
out
of
sight
and
out
of
mind
politeness
you
find
no
hard
matter
but
you
have
friends
in
plenty
better
than
i
more
sensible
more
refined
dear
girl
what
one
calls
sensible
on
earth
is
often
vanity
and
nonsense
how
ah
that
the
pure
and
simple
never
know
aught
of
themselves
and
all
their
holy
worth
that
meekness
lowliness
the
highest
measure
of
gifts
by
nature
lavished
full
and
free
one
little
moment
only
think
of
me
i
shall
to
think
of
you
have
ample
time
and
leisure
you
may
be
much
alone
our
household
is
but
small
i
own
and
yet
needs
care
if
truth
were
known
we
have
no
maid
so
i
attend
to
cooking
sweeping
knit
sew
do
every
thing
in
fact
and
mother
in
all
branches
of
housekeeping
is
so
exact
not
that
she
need
be
tied
so
very
closely
down
we
might
stand
higher
than
some
others
rather
a
nice
estate
was
left
us
by
my
father
a
house
and
garden
not
far
out
of
town
yet
after
all
my
life
runs
pretty
quiet
my
brother
is
a
soldier
my
little
sister
dead
with
the
dear
child
indeed
a
wearing
life
i
led
and
yet
with
all
its
plagues
again
would
gladly
try
it
the
child
was
such
a
pet
an
angel
if
like
thee
i
reared
her
and
she
heartily
loved
me
she
and
my
father
never
saw
each
other
he
died
before
her
birth
and
mother
was
given
up
so
low
she
lay
but
me
by
slow
degrees
recovered
day
by
day
of
course
she
now
long
time
so
feeble
to
nurse
the
poor
little
worm
was
unable
and
so
i
reared
it
all
alone
with
milk
and
water
was
my
own
upon
my
bosom
all
day
long
it
smiled
and
sprawled
and
so
grew
strong
ah
thou
hast
truly
known
joy
fairest
flower
but
no
less
truly
many
a
heavy
hour
the
wee
thing
cradle
stood
at
night
close
to
my
bed
did
the
least
thing
awake
her
my
sleep
took
flight
now
to
nurse
her
now
in
bed
to
take
her
then
if
she
was
not
still
to
rise
walk
up
and
down
the
room
and
dance
away
her
cries
and
at
the
stand
when
morning
streaked
the
skies
then
came
the
marketing
and
day
in
day
out
work
one
can
not
always
sir
good
temper
keep
but
then
it
sweetens
food
and
sweetens
sleep
pass
but
the
poor
women
suffer
you
must
own
a
bachelor
is
hard
of
reformation
madam
it
rests
with
such
as
you
alone
to
help
me
mend
my
situation
speak
plainly
sir
has
none
your
fancy
taken
has
none
made
out
a
tender
flame
to
waken
the
proverb
says
a
man
own
hearth
and
a
brave
wife
all
gold
and
pearls
are
worth
i
mean
has
your
heart
been
smitten
slightly
i
have
on
every
hand
been
entertained
politely
have
you
not
felt
i
mean
a
serious
intention
jesting
with
women
that
a
thing
one
should
mention
ah
you
misunderstand
it
grieves
me
that
i
should
but
this
i
understand
that
you
are
good
pass
so
then
my
little
angel
recognized
me
as
i
came
through
the
garden
gate
did
not
my
downcast
eyes
show
you
surprised
me
and
thou
that
liberty
of
late
that
impudence
of
mine
so
daring
as
thou
wast
home
from
church
repairing
i
was
confused
the
like
was
new
to
me
no
one
could
say
a
word
to
my
dishonor
ah
thought
i
has
he
haply
in
thy
manner
seen
any
boldness
impropriety
it
seemed
as
if
the
feeling
seized
him
that
he
might
treat
this
girl
just
as
it
pleased
him
let
me
confess
i
knew
not
from
what
cause
some
flight
relentings
here
began
to
threaten
danger
i
know
right
angry
with
myself
i
was
that
i
could
not
be

and
picks
off
the
leaves
one
after
what
that
for
a
bouquet
no
just
for
sport
how
go
you
laugh
at
me
away
picks
and
murmurs
to
what
murmurest
thou
half
he
loves
me

me
not

face
from
heaven
that
look
was
caught

tender
he

thee

loves
thee

what
thrill
is
this
o
shudder

this
look
of
mine
this
pressure
of
the
hand
shall
tell
thee
what
can
not
be
expressed
give
thyself
up
at
once
and
feel
a
rapture
an
ecstasy
never
to
end
never
it
end
were
nothing
but
blank
despair
no
unending
unending
margaret
his
hands
extricates
herself
and
runs
away
he
stands
a
moment
in
thought
then
follows
the
night
falls
fast
ay
and
we
must
away
if
it
were
not
for
one
vexation
i
would
insist
upon
your
longer
stay
nobody
seems
to
have
no
occupation
no
care
nor
labor
except
to
play
the
spy
upon
his
neighbor
and
one
becomes
do
they
may
but
where
our
pair
of
doves
flown
up
the
alley
yonder
light
he
seems
attached
to
her
no
wonder
and
she
to
him
so
goes
the
world
they
say
a
margaret
in
hides
behind
the
door
presses
the
tip
of
her
finger
to
her
lips
and
peeps
through
the
he
comes
faust
ah
rogue
how
sly
thou
art
i
caught
thee
embracing
him
and
returning
the
dear
good
man
i
love
thee
from
my
heart
mephistopheles
who
there
a
friend
a
beast
time
flies
i
do
offend
you
yes
sir
is
growing
late
may
i
not
now
attend
you
mother
would
fare
thee
well
and
must
i
leave
thee
then
farewell
adé
till
soon
we
meet
again
faust
mephistopheles
good
heavens
what
such
a
man
one
brain
can
in
itself
alone
contain
i
blush
my
rudeness
to
confess
and
answer
all
he
says
with
yes
am
a
poor
ignorant
child
do
see
what
he
can
possibly
find
in
me
woods
and
cavern
spirit
sublime
thou
me
me
all
for
which
i
prayed
thou
didst
not
lift
in
vain
thy
face
upon
me
in
a
flame
of
fire
me
majestic
nature
for
a
realm
the
power
to
feel
enjoy
her
not
alone
a
freezing
formal
visit
didst
thou
grant
deep
down
into
her
breast
invitedst
me
to
look
as
if
she
were
a
the
series
of
animated
things
thou
bidst
pass
by
me
teaching
me
to
know
my
brothers
in
the
waters
woods
and
air
and
when
the
forest
creaks
and
groans
the
giant
crashes
rending
off
the
neighboring
boughs
and
limbs
and
with
deep
roar
the
thundering
mountain
echoes
to
its
fall
to
a
safe
cavern
then
thou
leadest
me
showst
me
myself
and
my
own
bosom
deep
mysterious
wonders
open
on
my
view
and
when
before
my
sight
the
moon
comes
up
with
soft
effulgence
from
the
walls
of
rock
from
the
damp
thicket
slowly
float
around
the
silvery
shadows
of
a
world
gone
by
and
temper
meditation
sterner
joy
o
nothing
perfect
is
vouchsafed
to
man
i
feel
it
now
attendant
on
this
bliss
which
brings
me
ever
nearer
to
the
gods
thou
me
the
companion
whom
i
now
no
more
can
spare
though
cold
and
insolent
he
makes
me
hate
despise
myself
and
turns
thy
gifts
to
nothing
with
a
word
a
breath
he
kindles
up
a
in
my
breast
of
restless
longing
for
that
lovely
form
thus
from
desire
i
hurry
to
enjoyment
and
in
enjoyment
languish
for
desire
mephistopheles
will
not
this
life
have
tired
you
by
and
bye
i
wonder
it
so
long
delights
you
is
well
enough
for
once
the
thing
to
try
then
off
to
where
a
new
invites
you
would
thou
hadst
something
else
to
do
that
thus
to
spoil
my
joy
thou
burnest
well
well
i
leave
thee
gladly
too
thou
not
tell
me
that
in
earnest
no
great
loss
a
fellow
such
as
you
so
crazy
snappish
and
uncivil
one
has
all
day
his
hands
full
and
more
too
to
worm
out
from
him
what
he
have
one
do
or
not
do
puzzles
the
very
devil
now
that
i
like
that
just
the
tone
wants
thanks
for
boring
me
till
i
half
dead
poor
son
of
earth
if
left
alone
what
sort
of
life
wouldst
thou
have
led
how
oft
by
methods
all
my
own
i
chased
the
cobweb
fancies
from
thy
head
and
but
for
me
to
parts
unknown
thou
from
this
earth
hadst
long
since
fled
what
dost
thou
here
through
cave
and
crevice
groping
why
like
a
hornèd
owl
sit
moping
and
why
from
dripping
stone
damp
moss
and
rotten
wood
here
like
a
toad
suck
in
thy
food
delicious
pastime
ah
i
see
somewhat
of
doctor
sticks
to
thee
what
new
it
gives
me
canst
thou
guess
this
conversation
with
the
wilderness
ay
couldst
thou
dream
how
sweet
the
employment
thou
wouldst
be
devil
enough
to
grudge
me
my
enjoyment
ay
joy
from
fountains
by
night
and
day
to
lie
upon
the
mountains
to
clasp
in
ecstasy
both
earth
and
heaven
swelled
to
a
deity
by
fancy
leaven
pierce
like
a
nervous
thrill
earth
very
marrow
feel
the
whole
six
days
work
for
thee
too
narrow
to
enjoy
i
know
not
what
in
blest
elation
then
with
thy
lavish
love
the
whole
creation
below
thy
sight
the
mortal
cast
and
to
the
glorious
vision
give
at
last
a
i
must
not
say
what
termination
shame
on
thee
this
displeases
thee
well
surely
thou
hast
a
right
to
say
for
shame
demurely
one
must
not
mention
that
to
chaste
ears
never
which
chaste
hearts
can
not
do
without
however
and
in
one
word
i
grudge
you
not
the
pleasure
of
lying
to
yourself
in
moderate
measure
but
not
hold
out
long
i
know
already
thou
art
fast
recoiling
and
soon
at
this
rate
wilt
be
boiling
with
madness
or
despair
and
woe
enough
of
this
thy
sweetheart
sits
there
lonely
and
all
to
her
is
close
and
drear
her
thoughts
are
on
thy
image
only
she
holds
thee
past
all
utterance
dear
at
first
thy
passion
came
bounding
and
rushing
like
a
brooklet
with
melted
snow
and
rain
into
her
heart
thou
hast
poured
it
gushing
and
now
thy
brooklet
dry
again
methinks
thy
woodland
throne
resigning
better
suit
so
great
a
lord
the
poor
young
monkey
to
reward
for
all
the
love
with
which
she
pining
she
finds
the
time
dismally
long
stands
at
the
window
sees
the
clouds
on
high
over
the
old
go
by
were
i
a
little
bird
so
runneth
her
song
all
the
day
half
the
night
long
at
times
she
be
laughing
seldom
smile
at
times
she
seem
then
again
tranquil
you
deem
lovesick
all
the
while
viper
viper
ay
and
the
prey
grows
riper
reprobate
take
thee
far
behind
me
no
more
that
lovely
woman
name
bid
not
desire
for
her
sweet
person
flame
through
each
sense
again
to
blind
me
what
then
to
do
she
fancies
thou
hast
flown
and
more
than
half
she
right
i
own
i
near
her
and
though
far
away
my
word
i
not
forget
her
lose
her
never
fear
it
i
envy
the
body
of
the
lord
oft
as
those
precious
lips
of
hers
draw
near
it
no
doubt
and
oft
my
envious
thought
reposes
on
the
that
feed
among
the
roses
out
pimp
well
done
your
jeers
i
find
fair
game
for
laughter
the
god
who
made
both
lad
and
lass
unwilling
for
a
bungling
hand
to
pass
made
opportunity
right
after
but
come
fine
cause
for
lamentation
her
chamber
is
your
destination
and
not
the
grave
i
guess
what
are
the
joys
of
heaven
while
her
fond
arms
enfold
me
o
let
her
kindling
bosom
hold
me
feel
i
not
always
her
distress
the
houseless
am
i
not
the
unbefriended
the
monster
without
aim
or
rest
that
like
a
cataract
from
rock
to
rock
descended
to
the
abyss
with
maddening
greed
possest
she
on
its
brink
with
childlike
thoughts
and
lowly
perched
on
the
little
alpine
field
her
cot
this
narrow
world
so
still
and
holy
ensphering
like
a
heaven
her
lot
and
i
god
hatred
daring
could
not
be
content
the
rocks
all
headlong
bearing
by
me
to
ruins
rent
her
yea
her
peace
must
i
and
bury
this
victim
hell
to
thee
was
necessary
help
me
thou
fiend
the
pang
soon
ending
what
must
be
let
it
quickly
be
and
let
her
fate
upon
my
head
descending
crush
at
one
blow
both
her
and
me
ha
how
it
seethes
again
and
glows
go
in
and
comfort
her
thou
dunce
where
such
a
dolt
no
outlet
sees
or
knows
he
thinks
he
reached
the
end
at
once
none
but
the
brave
deserve
the
fair
thou
had
devil
enough
to
make
a
decent
show
of
for
all
the
world
a
devil
in
despair
is
just
the
insipidest
thing
i
know
of
margery
room
margery
the
my
heart
is
heavy
my
peace
is
i
never
ah
never
shall
find
it
more
while
him
i
crave
each
place
is
the
grave
the
world
is
all
turned
into
gall
my
wretched
brain
has
lost
its
wits
my
wretched
sense
is
all
in
bits
my
heart
is
heavy
my
peace
is
i
never
ah
never
shall
find
it
more
him
only
to
greet
i
the
street
look
down
him
only
to
meet
i
roam
through
town
his
lofty
step
his
noble
height
his
smile
of
sweetness
his
eye
of
might
his
words
of
magic
breathing
bliss
his
hand
warm
pressure
and
ah
his
kiss
my
heart
is
heavy
my
peace
is
i
never
ah
never
shall
find
it
more
my
bosom
yearns
to
behold
him
again
ah
could
i
find
him
that
best
of
men
i
tell
him
then
how
i
did
miss
him
and
kiss
him
as
much
as
i
could
die
on
his
kisses
i
surely
should
martha
garden
margaret
faust
promise
me
henry
what
i
can
how
is
it
now
with
thy
religion
say
i
know
thou
art
a
dear
good
man
but
fear
thy
thoughts
do
not
run
much
that
way
leave
that
my
child
enough
thou
hast
my
heart
for
those
i
love
with
life
i
freely
part
i
would
not
harm
a
soul
nor
of
its
faith
bereave
it
that
wrong
there
one
true
faith
one
must
believe
it
must
one
ah
could
i
influence
thee
dearest
the
holy
sacraments
thou
scarce
reverest
i
honor
them
but
yet
without
desire
of
mass
and
confession
both
long
begun
to
tire
believest
thou
in
god
my
darling
who
engages
to
say
i
do
believe
in
god
the
question
put
to
priests
or
sages
their
answer
seems
as
if
it
sought
to
mock
the
asker
then
thou
not
sweet
face
do
not
misunderstand
my
thought
who
dares
express
him
and
who
confess
him
saying
i
do
believe
a
man
heart
bearing
what
man
has
the
daring
to
say
i
acknowledge
him
not
the
the
enfolds
upholds
he
not
thee
me
himself
upsprings
not
heaven
blue
arch
high
thee
underneath
thee
does
not
earth
stand
fast
thou
not
nightly
climbing
tenderly
glancing
eternal
stars
am
i
not
gazing
eye
to
eye
on
thee
through
brain
and
bosom
throngs
not
all
life
to
thee
weaving
in
everlasting
mystery
obscurely
clearly
on
all
sides
of
thee
fill
with
it
to
its
utmost
stretch
thy
breast
and
in
the
consciousness
when
thou
art
wholly
blest
then
call
it
what
thou
wilt
joy
heart
love
god
i
have
no
name
to
give
it
all
comes
at
last
to
feeling
name
is
but
sound
and
smoke
beclouding
heaven
warm
glow
that
is
all
fine
and
good
i
know
and
just
as
the
priest
has
often
spoke
only
with
somewhat
different
phrases
all
hearts
too
in
all
places
wherever
heaven
pours
down
the
day
broad
blessing
each
in
its
way
the
truth
is
confessing
and
why
not
i
in
mine
too
well
all
have
a
way
that
they
incline
to
but
still
there
is
something
wrong
with
thee
thou
hast
no
christianity
dear
child
it
long
has
troubled
me
that
thou
shouldst
keep
such
company
how
so
the
man
whom
thou
for
crony
hast
is
one
whom
i
with
all
my
soul
detest
nothing
in
all
my
life
has
ever
stirred
up
in
my
heart
such
a
deep
disfavor
as
the
ugly
face
that
man
has
got
sweet
plaything
fear
him
not
his
presence
stirs
my
blood
i
own
i
can
love
almost
all
men
i
ever
known
but
much
as
thy
presence
with
pleasure
thrills
me
that
man
with
a
secret
horror
fills
me
and
then
for
a
knave
i
suspected
him
long
god
pardon
me
if
i
do
him
wrong
to
make
up
a
world
such
odd
sticks
are
needed
should
like
to
live
in
the
house
where
he
did
whenever
i
see
him
coming
in
he
always
wears
such
a
mocking
grin
half
cold
half
grim
one
sees
that
naught
has
interest
for
him
writ
on
his
brow
and
ca
be
mistaken
no
soul
in
him
can
love
awaken
i
feel
in
thy
arms
so
happy
so
free
i
yield
myself
up
so
blissfully
he
comes
and
all
in
me
is
closed
and
frozen
now
ah
thou
mistrustful
angel
thou
this
weighs
on
me
so
sore
that
when
we
meet
and
he
is
by
me
i
feel
as
if
i
loved
thee
now
no
more
nor
could
i
ever
pray
if
he
were
nigh
me
that
eats
the
very
heart
in
me
henry
it
must
be
so
with
thee
is
an
antipathy
of
thine
farewell
ah
can
i
recline
one
little
hour
upon
thy
bosom
pressing
my
heart
to
thine
and
all
my
soul
confessing
ah
if
my
chamber
were
alone
this
night
the
bolt
should
give
thee
free
admission
but
mother
wakes
at
every
tone
and
if
she
had
the
least
suspicion
heavens
i
should
die
upon
the
spot
thou
angel
need
of
that
there
not
here
is
a
flask
three
drops
alone
mix
with
her
drink
and
nature
into
a
deep
and
pleasant
sleep
is
thrown
refuse
thee
what
can
i
poor
creature
i
hope
of
course
it
will
not
harm
her
would
i
advise
it
then
my
charmer
best
man
when
thou
dost
look
at
me
i
know
not
what
moves
me
to
do
thy
will
i
have
already
done
so
much
for
thee
scarce
any
thing
seems
left
me
to
fulfil
mephistopheles
the
monkey
is
she
gone
hast
played
the
spy
again
i
overheard
it
all
quite
fully
the
doctor
has
been
well
catechized
then
hope
it
will
sit
well
on
him
truly
the
maidens
wo
rest
till
they
know
if
the
men
believe
as
good
old
custom
bids
them
do
they
think
if
there
he
yields
he
follow
our
will
too
monster
thou
wilt
not
canst
not
see
how
this
true
soul
that
loves
so
dearly
yet
hugs
at
every
cost
the
faith
which
she
counts
heaven
itself
is
sincerely
to
think
of
giving
up
her
dearest
man
for
lost
thou
supersensual
sensual
wooer
a
girl
by
the
nose
is
leading
thee
abortion
vile
of
fire
and
sewer
in
physiognomy
too
her
skill
is
masterly
when
i
am
near
she
feels
she
knows
not
how
my
little
mask
some
secret
meaning
shows
she
thinks
i
certainly
a
genius
now
perhaps
the
very
devil
who
knows
then
well
what
that
to
you
i
find
my
pleasure
in
it
too
at
the
well
margery
lizzy
hast
heard
no
news
of
barbara
no
not
a
word
i
not
been
out
much
lately
it
came
to
me
through
sybill
very
straightly
she
made
a
fool
of
herself
at
last
they
say
that
comes
of
taking
airs
what
meanst
thou
pah
she
daily
eats
and
drinks
for
two
now
ah
it
serves
the
jade
right
for
being
so
callow
how
long
she
been
hanging
upon
the
fellow
such
a
promenading
to
fair
and
dance
parading
everywhere
as
first
she
must
shine
he
was
treating
her
always
with
tarts
and
wine
she
began
to
think
herself
something
fine
and
let
her
vanity
so
degrade
her
that
she
even
accepted
the
presents
he
made
her
there
was
hugging
and
smacking
and
so
it
went
on
and
lo
and
behold
the
flower
is
gone
poor
thing
canst
any
pity
for
her
feel
when
such
as
we
spun
at
the
wheel
our
mothers
kept
us
after
dark
while
she
stood
cozy
with
her
spark
or
sate
on
the
or
sauntered
round
and
never
an
hour
too
long
they
found
but
now
her
pride
may
let
itself
down
to
do
penance
at
church
in
the
sinner
gown
he
certainly
take
her
for
his
wife
he
be
a
fool
a
spruce
young
blade
has
room
enough
to
ply
his
trade
besides
he
gone
now
that
not
fair
if
she
gets
him
her
lot
be
hard
to
bear
the
boys
will
tear
up
her
wreath
and
what
more
we
strew
chopped
straw
before
her
door
going
home
time
was
when
i
too
instead
of
bewailing
could
boldly
jeer
at
a
poor
girl
failing
when
my
scorn
could
scarcely
find
expression
at
hearing
of
another
transgression
how
black
it
seemed
though
black
as
could
be
it
never
was
black
enough
for
me
i
blessed
my
soul
and
felt
so
high
and
now
myself
in
sin
i
lie
yet
all
that
led
me
to
it
sure
o
god
it
was
so
dear
so
pure
donjon
a
niche
a
devotional
image
of
the
mater
dolorosa
before
it
pots
of
margery
fresh
flowers
into
the
ah
hear
me
draw
kindly
near
me
mother
of
sorrows
heal
my
woe
and
stricken
with
pangs
that
sicken
thou
seest
thy
son
last
flow
thy
look
thy
sighing
to
god
are
crying
charged
with
a
son
and
mother
woe
sad
mother
what
other
knows
the
pangs
that
eat
me
to
the
bone
what
within
my
poor
heart
burneth
how
it
trembleth
how
it
yearneth
thou
canst
feel
and
thou
alone
go
where
i
will
i
never
find
peace
or
hope
forever
woe
woe
and
misery
alone
when
all
are
sleeping
i
weeping
weeping
weeping
my
heart
is
crushed
in
me
the
pots
before
my
window
in
the
early
alas
my
tears
bedewed
them
as
i
plucked
for
thee
these
flowers
when
the
bright
sun
good
morrow
in
at
my
window
said
already
in
my
anguish
i
sate
there
in
my
bed
from
shame
and
death
redeem
me
oh
draw
near
me
and
pitying
hear
me
mother
of
sorrows
heal
my
woe
night
margery
valentine
margery
when
at
the
mess
i
used
to
sit
where
many
a
one
will
show
his
wit
and
heard
my
comrades
one
and
all
the
flower
of
the
sex
extol
drowning
their
praise
with
bumpers
high
leaning
upon
my
elbows
i
would
hear
the
braggadocios
through
and
then
when
it
came
my
turn
too
would
stroke
my
beard
and
smiling
say
a
brimming
bumper
in
my
hand
all
very
decent
in
their
way
but
is
there
one
in
all
the
land
with
my
sweet
margy
to
compare
a
candle
to
hold
to
my
sister
fair
bravo
kling
klang
it
echoed
round
one
party
cried
is
truth
he
speaks
she
is
the
jewel
of
the
sex
and
the
braggarts
all
in
silence
were
bound
and
now
one
could
pull
out
his
hair
with
vexation
and
run
up
the
walls
for
mortification
every
creature
that
goes
in
breeches
can
mock
me
with
sneers
and
stinging
speeches
and
i
like
a
guilty
debtor
sitting
for
fear
of
each
casual
word
am
sweating
and
though
i
could
smash
them
in
my
ire
i
dare
not
call
a
soul
of
them
liar
what
that
comes
yonder
sneaking
along
there
are
two
of
them
there
if
i
see
not
wrong
he
i
give
him
a
dose
that
cure
him
he
not
leave
the
spot
alive
i
assure
him
faust
mephistopheles
how
from
yon
window
of
the
sacristy
the
lamp
sends
up
its
glimmer
and
round
the
edge
grows
ever
dimmer
till
in
the
gloom
its
flickerings
die
so
in
my
bosom
all
is
nightlike
a
starving
i
feel
quite
like
that
the
fire
ladders
crawls
then
softly
creeps
ground
the
walls
my
aim
quite
virtuous
a
bit
of
thievish
lust
a
bit
of
wantonness
i
feel
it
all
my
members
haunting
the
glorious
walpurgis
night
one
day
then
comes
the
feast
enchanting
that
shall
all
pinings
well
requite
meanwhile
can
that
the
casket
be
i
wonder
i
see
behind
rise
glittering
yonder
yes
and
thou
soon
shalt
have
the
pleasure
of
lifting
out
the
precious
treasure
i
lately
the
lid
did
squint
has
piles
of
i
but
not
a
jewel
not
a
ring
to
deck
my
mistress
not
a
trinket
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
some
such
thing
sort
of
pearl
bracelet
i
should
think
it
that
well
i
always
like
to
bear
some
present
when
i
visit
my
fair
you
should
not
murmur
if
your
fate
is
to
have
a
bit
of
pleasure
gratis
now
as
the
stars
fill
heaven
with
their
bright
throng
list
a
fine
piece
artistic
purely
i
sing
her
here
a
moral
song
to
make
a
fool
of
her
more
surely
to
the
what
dost
thou
here
katrina
dear
at
daybreak
drear
before
thy
lover
chamber
give
give
the
maid
his
door
lets
in
no
more
goes
out
a
maid
remember
take
heed
take
heed
once
done
the
deed
ye
rue
with
speed
and
then
good
night
poor
thing
a
though
so
fair
his
speech
beware
until
you
bear
his
ring
upon
your
finger
whom
thou
here
what
prey
dost
scent
offspring
of
perdition
to
hell
goes
first
the
instrument
to
hell
then
follows
the
musician
he
broken
the
guitar
to
music
then
now
a
game
of
cracking
skulls
we
try
now
never
you
flinch
sir
doctor
brisk
mind
every
word
i
say
wary
stand
close
by
me
out
with
your
whisk
thrust
home
upon
the
churl
i
parry
then
parry
that
be
sure
why
not
and
that
with
ease
the
devil
aid
he
got
but
what
is
this
my
hand
already
lame
thrust
home
o
woe
now
is
the
lubber
tame
but
come
we
must
be
off
i
hear
a
clatter
and
cries
of
murder
too
that
fast
increase
i
an
old
hand
to
manage
the
police
but
then
the
penal
court
another
matter
come
out
come
out
the
bring
on
a
light
they
swear
and
scuffle
scream
and
fight
there
one
has
got
where
are
the
murderers
have
they
flown
who
lying
here
thy
mother
son
almighty
god
what
woe
i
dying
that
is
quickly
said
and
even
quicklier
done
women
why
howl
as
if
come
hear
me
every
one
gather
round
my
margery
look
young
art
thou
still
but
managest
thy
matters
ill
hast
not
learned
out
yet
quite
i
say
in
confidence
think
it
thou
art
just
once
for
all
a
whore
why
be
one
then
outright
my
brother
god
what
words
to
me
in
this
game
let
our
lord
god
be
that
which
is
done
alas
is
done
and
every
thing
its
course
will
run
with
one
you
secretly
begin
presently
more
of
them
come
in
and
when
a
dozen
share
in
thee
thou
art
the
whole
town
property
when
shame
is
born
to
this
world
of
sorrow
the
birth
is
carefully
hid
from
sight
and
the
mysterious
veil
of
night
to
cover
her
head
they
borrow
yes
they
would
gladly
stifle
the
wearer
but
as
she
grows
and
holds
herself
high
she
walks
uncovered
in
day
broad
eye
though
she
has
not
become
a
whit
fairer
the
uglier
her
face
to
sight
the
more
she
courts
the
noonday
light
already
i
the
time
can
see
when
all
good
souls
shall
shrink
from
thee
thou
prostitute
when
thou
by
them
as
if
a
tainted
corpse
were
nigh
them
thy
heart
within
thy
breast
shall
quake
then
when
they
look
thee
in
the
face
shalt
wear
no
gold
chain
more
on
thy
neck
then
shalt
stand
no
more
in
the
holy
place
no
pleasure
in
collars
take
then
nor
for
the
dance
thy
person
deck
then
but
into
some
dark
corner
gliding
beggars
and
cripples
wilt
be
hiding
and
even
should
god
thy
sin
forgive
wilt
be
curs
on
earth
while
thou
shalt
live
your
soul
to
the
mercy
of
god
surrender
will
you
add
to
your
load
the
sin
of
slander
could
i
get
at
thy
frame
vile
bawd
so
lost
to
all
sense
of
shame
then
might
i
hope
this
side
heaven
richly
to
find
my
sins
forgiven
my
brother
this
is
hell
to
me
i
tell
thee
let
these
weak
tears
be
when
thy
last
hold
of
honor
broke
thou
my
heart
the
heaviest
stroke
i
going
home
now
through
the
grave
to
god
a
soldier
and
a
brave
cathedral
organ
and
margery
a
crowd
of
evil
spirit
margery
how
different
was
it
with
thee
margy
when
innocent
and
artless
thou
here
to
the
altar
from
the
little
petitions
lisping
half
full
of
child
play
half
full
of
heaven
margy
where
are
thy
thoughts
what
crime
is
buried
deep
within
thy
heart
prayest
thou
haply
for
thy
mother
who
slept
over
into
long
long
pain
on
thy
account
whose
blood
upon
thy
threshold
lies
and
stirs
there
not
already
beneath
thy
heart
a
life
tormenting
itself
and
thee
with
bodings
of
its
coming
hour
woe
woe
could
i
rid
me
of
the
thoughts
still
through
my
brain
backward
and
forward
flitting
against
my
will

dies

in
favillâ
wrath
smites
thee

the

the
graves
are
trembling
and
thy
heart
made
again
for
fiery
torments
waking
from
its
ashes
starts
up

i
were
hence
i
feel
as
if
the

my
breath
were
stifling
the
choral
chant
my
heart
were
melting

your

wouldst
thou
not
like
a
broomstick
now
to
ride
on
at
this
rate
we
are
still
a
long
way
off
i
rather
have
a
good
tough
goat
by
half
than
the
best
legs
a
man
set
his
pride
on
so
long
as
i
a
pair
of
good
fresh
legs
to
stride
on
enough
for
me
this
knotty
staff
what
use
of
shortening
the
way
following
the
valley
labyrinthine
winding
then
up
this
rock
a
pathway
finding
from
which
the
spring
leaps
down
in
bubbling
play
that
is
what
spices
such
a
walk
i
say
spring
through
the
veins
is
flowing
the
very
pine
is
feeling
it
should
not
its
influence
set
our
limbs
i
do
not
feel
it
not
a
bit
my
wintry
blood
runs
very
slowly
i
wish
my
path
were
filled
with
frost
and
snow
the
moon
imperfect
disk
how
melancholy
it
rises
there
with
red
belated
glow

out
of

i
shall
be
able
to

quite
unstable

a

way
heigh
heigh

by

i
blow
your
flickering

out
with
a
puff
you

the

that
plain
enough
so
i
comply
with
your
desire
but
see
the
mountain
and
if
your

to
be
a
light
strict
rectitude
you
scarce
require
faust
mephistopheles
alternate
spheres
of
magic
dream
and

now
it
seems
are
opening
us
for
thy
credit
use

let
the
way
be
plain
before
us
through
the
lengthening
desert
regions
see
how
trees
on
trees
in
legions
hurrying
by
us
change
their
places
and
the
bowing
crags
make
faces
and
the
rocks
long
noses
showing
hear
them
snoring
hear
them
blowing
down
through
stones
through
mosses
flowing

the
brook
and
brooklet
springing
hear
i
rustling
hear
i
singing
sweet
and
melancholy
voices
of
those
days
so
holy
all
our
loving
longing
yearning
echo
like
a
strain
returning
from
the
olden
times
is
ringing
uhu
schuhu
are
the
jay
and
owl
and
pewit
all
awake
and
loudly
calling
what
goes
through
the
bushes
yonder
can
it
be
the
salamander
belly
thick
and
legs
roots
and
fibres
crawling
out
from
rocky
sandy
places
we
turn
our
faces
stretch
enormous
fingers
round
us
here
to
catch
us
there
confound
us
thick
black
knars
to
life
are
starting
darting
at
the
traveller
swarming
armies
forming
scamper
on
through
moss
and
heather
and
the
in
the
darkling
with
their
crowded
escort
sparkling
would
confound
us
altogether
but
to
guess
i
vainly
trying
are
we
stopping
are
we
hieing
round
and
round
us
all
seems
flying
rocks
and
trees
that
make
grimaces
and
the
of
the
places
ever
swelling
multiplying
here
my
tightly
thumb
it
we
have
reached
a
middle
summit
whence
one
stares
to
see
how
shines
mammon
in
the
how
strangely
through
the
dim
recesses
a
dreary
dawning
seems
to
glow
and
even
down
the
deep
abysses
its
melancholy
quiverings
throw
here
smoke
is
boiling
mist
exhaling
here
from
a
vapory
veil
it
gleams
then
a
fine
thread
of
light
goes
trailing
then
gushes
up
in
fiery
streams
the
valley
here
you
see
it
follow
one
mighty
flood
with
hundred
rills
and
here
pent
up
in
some
deep
hollow
it
breaks
on
all
sides
down
the
hills
here
darting
up
before
us
like
golden
rise
and
fall
but
yonder
see
how
blazes
us
all
up
and
down
the
rocky
wall
has
not
sir
mammon
gloriously
lighted
his
palace
for
this
festive
night
count
thyself
lucky
for
the
sight
i
catch
now
a
glimpse
of
noisy
guests
invited
how
the
mad
tempest
sweeps
the
air
on
cheek
and
neck
the
how
they
flout
me
must
seize
the
rock
old
ribs
and
hold
on
stoutly
else
will
they
hurl
thee
down
the
dark
abysses
there
a
thickens
the
gloom
hark
how
the
forests
crash
and
boom
out
fly
the
owls
in
dread
and
wonder
splitting
their
columns
asunder
hear
it
the
evergreen
palaces
shaking
boughs
are
twisting
and
breaking
of
stems
what
a
grinding
and
moaning
of
roots
what
a
creaking
and
groaning
in
frightful
confusion
headlong
tumbling
they
fall
with
a
sound
of
thunder
rumbling
and
through
the
ravines
and
abysses
the
tempest
howls
and
hisses
hearst
thou
voices
high
up
us
close
around
us
far
before
us
through
the
mountain
all
along
swells
a
torrent
of
magic
song
the
witches
go
to
the
brocken
top
the
stubble
is
yellow
and
green
the
crop
they
gather
there
at
the
call
sir
urian
sits
at
the
head
of
all
then
on
we
go
stone
and
stock
the
witch
she
and
the
buck
old
baubo
comes
along
i
vow
she
rides
upon
a
then
honor
to
whom
honor
due
baubo
ahead
and
lead
the
crew
a
good
fat
sow
and
on
her
back
then
follow
the
witches
all
in
a
pack
which
way
didst
thou
come
by
the
ilsenstein
peeped
into
an
owl
nest
mother
of
mine
what
a
pair
of
eyes
to
hell
with
your
flurry
why
ride
in
such
hurry
the
hag
be
confounded
my
skin
flie
has
wounded
the
way
is
broad
the
way
is
long
what
means
this
noisy
crazy
throng
the
broom
it
scratches
the
fork
it
flicks
the
child
is
stifled
the
mother
breaks
like
snails
we
creeping
on
the
women
all
ahead
are
gone
when
to
the
bad
one
house
we
go
she
gains
a
thousand
steps
you
know
other
we
take
it
not
precisely
so
what
she
in
thousand
steps
can
go
make
all
the
haste
she
ever
can
done
in
just
one
leap
by
man
come
on
come
on
from
felsensee
we
gladly
join
your
airy
way
for
wash
and
clean
us
as
much
as
we
will
we
always
prove
unfruitful
still
the
wind
is
hushed
the
star
shoots
by
the
moon
she
hides
her
sickly
eye
the
whirling
whizzing
darts
forth
ten
thousand
sparks
of
fire
ho
there
whoa
there
who
calls
from
the
rocky
cleft
below
there
take
me
too
take
me
too
three
hundred
years
i
climbed
to
you
seeking
in
vain
my
mates
to
come
at
for
i
can
never
reach
the
summit
can
ride
the
besom
the
stick
can
ride
can
stride
the
pitchfork
the
goat
can
stride
who
neither
will
ride
nor
can
must
be
forever
a
ruined
man
i
hobble
on
i
out
of
wind
and
still
they
leave
me
far
behind
to
find
peace
here
in
vain
i
come
i
get
no
more
than
i
left
at
home
of
the
witch
salve
can
never
fail
a
rag
will
answer
for
a
sail
any
trough
will
do
for
a
ship
that
tight
he
never
fly
who
flies
not
and
when
the
highest
peak
we
round
then
lightly
graze
along
the
ground
and
cover
the
heath
where
eye
can
see
with
the
flower
of
what
squeezing
and
pushing
what
rustling
and
hustling
what
hissing
and
twirling
what
chattering
and
bustling
how
it
shines
and
sparkles
and
burns
and
stinks
a
true
methinks
keep
close
or
we
are
parted
in
two
winks
where
art
thou
the
here
what
carried
off
already
then
i
must
use
my
steady
room
squire
voland
comes
sweet
people
clear
the
ground
here
doctor
grasp
my
arm
and
at
a
single
bound
let
us
escape
while
yet
is
easy
for
the
like
of
me
they
far
too
crazy
see
yonder
something
shines
with
quite
peculiar
glare
and
draws
me
to
those
bushes
mazy
come
come
and
let
us
slip
in
there
sprite
to
follow
thee
i
fated
but
i
must
say
thy
plan
was
very
bright
we
seek
the
brocken
here
on
the
walpurgis
night
then
hold
ourselves
when
here
completely
isolated
what
motley
flames
light
up
the
heather
a
merry
club
is
met
together
in
a
small
group
one
not
alone
i
rather
be
up
there
i
own
see
curling
smoke
and
flames
right
blue
to
see
the
evil
one
they
travel
there
many
a
riddle
to
unravel
and
tie
up
many
another
too
let
the
great
world
there
rave
and
riot
we
here
will
house
ourselves
in
quiet
the
saying
has
been
long
well
known
in
the
great
world
one
makes
a
small
one
of
his
own
i
see
young
witches
there
quite
naked
all
and
old
ones
who
more
prudent
cover
for
my
sake
some
flight
things
look
over
the
fun
is
great
the
trouble
small
i
hear
them
tuning
instruments
curs
jangle
well
one
must
learn
with
such
things
not
to
wrangle
come
on
come
on
for
so
it
needs
must
be
thou
shalt
at
once
be
introduced
by
me
and
i
new
thanks
from
thee
be
earning
that
is
no
scanty
space
what
sayst
thou
friend
just
take
a
look
thou
scarce
canst
see
the
end
there
in
a
row
a
hundred
fires
are
burning
they
dance
chat
cook
drink
love
where
can
be
found
any
thing
better
now
the
wide
world
round
wilt
thou
as
things
are
now
in
this
condition
present
thyself
for
devil
or
magician
i
been
much
used
indeed
to
going
incognito
but
then
on
one
will
his
order
show
no
garter
makes
my
rank
appear
but
then
the
cloven
foot
stands
high
in
honor
here
seest
thou
the
snail
look
there
where
she
comes
creeping
yonder
had
she
already
smelt
the
rat
i
should
not
very
greatly
wonder
disguise
is
useless
now
depend
on
that
come
then
we
will
from
fire
to
fire
wander
thou
shalt
the
wooer
be
and
i
the
pander
a
party
who
sit
round
expiring
old
gentlemen
you
scarce
can
hear
the
fiddle
you
gain
more
praise
from
me
ensconced
there
in
the
middle
that
young
rousing
tousing
set
one
can
at
home
enough
retirement
get
trust
not
the
people
fickle
favor
however
much
thou
mayst
for
them
have
done
nations
as
well
as
women
ever
worship
the
rising
not
the
setting
sun
from
the
right
path
we
drifted
far
away
the
good
old
past
my
heart
engages
those
were
the
real
golden
ages
when
such
as
we
held
all
the
sway
we
were
no
simpletons
i
trow
and
often
did
the
thing
we
should
not
but
all
is
turning
now
and
if
we
tried
to
stem
the
wave
we
could
not
who
on
the
whole
will
read
a
work
today
of
moderate
sense
with
any
pleasure
and
as
regards
the
dear
young
people
they
pert
and
precocious
are
beyond
all
measure
all
at
once
appears
very
the
race
is
ripened
for
the
judgment
day
so
i
for
the
last
time
climb
the
thinking
and
as
my
cask
runs
thick
i
say
the
world
too
on
its
lees
is
sinking
good
gentlemen
do
hurry
by
the
opportunity
a
rare
one
my
stock
is
an
uncommon
fair
one
please
give
it
an
attentive
eye
there
nothing
in
my
shop
whatever
but
on
the
earth
its
mate
is
found
that
has
not
proved
itself
right
clever
to
deal
mankind
some
fatal
wound
no
dagger
here
but
blood
has
some
time
stained
it
no
cup
that
has
not
held
some
hot
and
poisonous
juice
and
stung
to
death
the
throat
that
drained
it
no
trinket
but
did
once
a
maid
seduce
no
sword
but
hath
some
tie
of
sacred
honor
riven
or
haply
from
behind
through
foeman
neck
been
driven
you
quite
behind
the
times
i
tell
you
aunty
be
done
is
done
get
us
up
something
new
and
jaunty
for
new
things
now
the
people
run
to
keep
my
wits
i
must
endeavor
call
this
a
fair
i
swear
i
never
upward
the
billowy
mass
is
moving
you
shoved
along
and
think
meanwhile
you
shoving
what
woman
that
mark
her
attentively
that
lilith
who
adam
first
wife
is
she
beware
of
her
one
charm
those
lovely
tresses
in
which
she
shines
preeminently
fair
when
those
soft
meshes
once
a
young
man
snare
how
hard
be
to
escape
he
little
guesses
there
sit
an
old
one
and
a
young
together
they
skipped
it
well
along
the
heather
no
rest
from
that
till
night
is
through
another
dance
is
up
come
on
let
us
fall
to
with
the
young
a
lovely
dream
once
came
to
me
in
it
i
saw
an
two
beauteous
apples
beckoned
there
i
climbed
to
pluck
the
fruit
so
fair
fair
apples
you
greatly
seem
to
prize
and
did
so
even
in
paradise
i
feel
myself
delighted
much
that
in
my
garden
i
have
such
the
old
a
dismal
dream
once
came
to
me
in
it
i
saw
a
cloven
tree
it
had
a
but
still
i
looked
on
it
with
right
with
best
respect
i
here
salute
the
noble
knight
of
the
cloven
foot
let
him
hold
a
near
if
a
he
does
not
fear
what
this
ye
undertake
confounded
crew
have
we
not
you
demonstration
no
spirit
stands
on
legs
in
all
creation
and
here
you
dance
just
as
we
mortals
do
fair
what
does
that
fellow
at
our
ball
eh
he
must
have
a
hand
in
all
what
others
dance
that
he
appraises
unless
each
step
he
criticizes
the
step
as
good
as
no
step
he
will
call
but
when
we
move
ahead
that
plagues
him
more
than
all
if
in
a
circle
you
would
still
keep
turning
as
he
himself
in
his
old
mill
goes
round
he
would
be
sure
to
call
that
sound
and
most
so
if
you
went
by
his
superior
learning
what
and
you
still
are
here
unheard
off
obstinates
begone
we
cleared
it
up
you
shallow
pates
the
devilish
pack
from
rules
deliverance
boasts
we
grown
so
wise
and
tegel
still
sees
ghosts
how
long
i
toiled
to
sweep
these
cobwebs
from
the
brain
and
yet
unheard
of
folly
all
in
vain
fair
and
yet
on
us
the
stupid
bore
still
tries
it
i
tell
you
spirits
to
the
face
i
give
to
no
place
my
spirit
can
not
exercise
it
dance
i
ca
succeed
i
know
it
still
there
the
journey
which
i
like
to
make
and
hope
before
the
final
step
i
take
to
rid
the
world
of
devil
and
of
poet
you
see
him
shortly
sit
into
a
puddle
in
that
way
his
heart
is
reassured
when
on
his
rump
the
leeches
well
shall
fuddle
of
spirits
and
of
spirit
he
be
cured
faust
has
left
the
why
let
the
lovely
girl
slip
through
thy
fingers
who
to
thy
dance
so
sweetly
sang
ah
right
amidst
her
singing
sprang
a
wee
red
mouse
from
her
mouth
and
made
me
cower
that
nothing
wrong
you
in
a
dainty
way
enough
the
mouse
at
least
wa
gray
who
minds
such
thing
in
happy
amorous
hour
then
saw
i
what
mephisto
seest
thou
not
yon
pale
fair
child
afar
who
stands
so
sad
and
lonely
and
moves
so
slowly
from
the
spot
her
feet
seem
locked
and
she
drags
them
only
i
must
confess
she
seems
to
me
to
look
like
my
own
good
margery
leave
that
alone
the
sight
no
health
can
bring
it
is
a
magic
shape
an
idol
no
live
thing
to
meet
it
never
can
be
good
its
haggard
look
congeals
a
mortal
blood
and
almost
turns
him
into
stone
the
story
of
medusa
thou
hast
known
yes
is
a
dead
one
eyes
that
stare
upon
me
eyes
that
no
loving
hand
closed
that
is
the
angel
form
of
her
who
won
me
tis
the
dear
breast
on
which
i
once
reposed
is
sorcery
all
thou
fool
misled
by
passion
dreams
for
she
to
every
one
his
own
love
seems
what
bliss
what
woe
methinks
i
never
my
sight
from
that
sweet
form
can
sever
seeft
thou
not
thicker
than
a
back
a
small
red
ribbon
fitting
sweetly
the
lovely
neck
it
clasps
so
neatly
i
see
the
streak
around
her
neck
her
head
beneath
her
arm
you
next
behold
her
perseus
has
lopped
it
from
her
shoulder
but
let
thy
crazy
passion
rest
come
climb
with
me
yon
hillock
breast
was
the
prater
merrier
then
and
if
no
sorcerer
charm
is
me
that
is
a
theatre
before
me
what
doing
there
they
straight
begin
again
a
piece
the
very
last
of
seven
to
have
so
much
the
fashion
here
thinks
fit
by
dilettantes
it
is
given
by
a
dilettante
writ
excuse
me
sirs
i
go
to
greet
you
i
am
the
dilettant
when
i
upon
the
blocksberg
meet
you
that
i
approve
for
there
your
place
i
grant
dream
or
oberon
and
titania
golden
nuptials
here
for
once
we
rest
heirs
of
mieding
glory
all
the
scenery
we
display
damp
vale
and
mountain
hoary
to
make
the
wedding
a
golden
one
must
fifty
years
expire
but
when
once
the
strife
is
done
i
prize
the
the
higher
spirits
if
my
good
ye
mean
now
let
all
wrongs
be
righted
for
your
king
and
queen
are
once
again
united
once
let
puck
coming
whirling
round
and
set
his
foot
to
whisking
hundreds
with
him
throng
the
ground
frolicking
and
frisking
ariel
awakes
the
song
with
many
a
heavenly
measure
fools
not
few
he
draws
along
but
fair
ones
hear
with
pleasure
spouses
who
your
feuds
would
smother
take
from
us
a
moral
two
who
wish
to
love
each
other

only
first
to
quarrel
if
she
pouts
and
he
looks
grim
take
them
both
together
to
the
north
pole
carry
him
and
off
with
her
to
and

all
conditions

take
for
our
musicians

owneth
how
the
through
his
droneth
that
is
just
shaping
too
give
the
child
and
winglet
is
no
animalcule
true
but
a
poetic
thinglet
pair
of
little
step
and
lofty
bound
through
and
flowers
well
thou
trippest
the
ground
but
soarst
not
the
bowers
this
must
be
masquerade
how
odd
my
very
eyes
believe
i
oberon
the
beauteous
god
here
perceive
i
neither
claws
nor
tail
i
see
and
yet
without
a
cavil
just
as
the
gods
of
greece
were
he
must
also
be
a
devil
what
here
i
catch
is
to
be
sure
but
sketchy
recreation
and
yet
for
my
italian
tour
timely
preparation
bad
luck
has
brought
me
here
i
see
the
rioting
grows
louder
and
of
the
whole
witch
company
there
are
but
two
wear
powder
powder
becomes
like
petticoat
your
little
gray
old
woman
naked
i
sit
upon
my
goat
and
show
the
untrimmed
human
to
stand
here
jawing
with
you
we
too
much
cherish
but
young
and
tender
though
you
be
i
hope
you
rot
and
perish
of
the
and
please
swarm
not
so
round
the
naked
crickets
frogs
in
trees
keep
time
and
do
forsake
it
one
find
better
company
who
can
here
brides
attended
duly
there
bachelors
ranged
man
by
man
most
hopeful
people
truly
towards
the
other
and
if
the
ground
do
open
straight
the
crazy
crew
to
swallow
you
see
me
at
a
furious
rate
jump
down
to
hell
black
hollow
we
are
here
as
insects
ah
small
sharp
nippers
wielding
satan
as
our
worthy
honor
yielding
see
how
naïvely
there
the
throng
among
themselves
are
jesting
you
hear
them
i
no
doubt
ere
long
their
good
kind
hearts
protesting
apollo
in
this
witches
group
himself
right
gladly
loses
for
truly
i
could
lead
this
troop
much
easier
than
the
muses
genius
of
the
right
company
will
raise
man
up
come
grasp
my
skirt
lord
bless
us
the
blocksberg
has
a
good
broad
top
like
germany
parnassus
tell
me
who
is
that
stiff
man
with
what
stiff
step
he
travels
he
noses
out
he
can
he
scents
the
jesuit
devils
in
clear
and
muddy
water
too
the
gentleman
fishes
our
pious
gentlemen
we
view
fingering
in
devils
dishes
of
this
yes
with
the
pious
ones
is
clear
all
grist
that
comes
to
their
mill
they
build
their
tabernacles
here
on
blocksberg
as
on
carmel
hark
a
new
choir
salutes
my
ear
i
hear
a
distant
drumming
be
not
disturbed
reeds
you
hear
the
bitterns
bumming
how
each
his
legs
kicks
up
and
flings
pulls
foot
as
best
he
able
the
clumsy
hops
the
crooked
springs
quite
disreputable
the
scurvy
pack
they
hate
is
clear
like
cats
and
dogs
each
other
like
orpheus
lute
the
bagpipe
here
binds
beast
to
beast
as
brother
you
not
scream
down
my
reason
though
by
criticism
cavils
the
devil
something
that
i
know
else
how
could
there
be
devils
ah
phantasy
for
once
thy
sway
is
guilty
of
high
treason
if
all
i
see
is
i
plain
i
lost
my
reason
to
me
of
all
life
woes
and
plagues
substance
is
most
provoking
for
the
first
time
i
feel
my
legs
beneath
me
almost
rocking
i
overjoyed
at
being
here
and
even
among
these
rude
ones
for
if
bad
spirits
are
is
clear
there
also
must
be
good
ones
they
spy
the
flame
they
roam
and
think
rich
stores
to
rifle
here
such
as
i
are
quite
at
home
for
rhymes
with
of
the
cricket
frogs
in
trees
you
cursed
dilettanti
and
peace
musicians
you
right
jaunty
clever
we
call
this
band
of
merry
ones
that
skip
it
unable
on
our
feet
to
stand
upon
our
heads
we
trip
it
time
was
we
caught
our
too
god
help
us

change
him

misery
inconceivable
by

more
than
one
creature

sank
into

the
first
in

did
not
atone
for
the
guilt
of
all
the

the

for
