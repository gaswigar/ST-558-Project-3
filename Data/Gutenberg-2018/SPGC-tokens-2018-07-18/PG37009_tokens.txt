preface
in
this
little
book
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
discuss
the
more
abundant
and
widely
distributed
butterflies
of
eastern
north
america
from
the
point
of
view
of
their
life
histories
and
their
relations
to
their
surroundings
in
so
doing
i
have
of
course
availed
myself
of
the
written
records
of
a
host
of
students
of
butterflies
without
whose
labors
no
such
volume
would
be
possible
among
these
two
names
stand
out
preëminent
william
edwards
and
samuel
scudder
each
was
the
author
of
a
sumptuous
work
on
american
butterflies
to
which
all
later
students
must
refer
both
for
information
and
for
inspiration
many
others
however
have
made
notable
contributions
to
our
literature
of
these
ethereal
creatures
every
seeker
after
a
knowledge
of
butterflies
will
soon
find
himself
indebted
to
the
writings
of
such
investigators
as
the
comstocks
denton
dickerson
dyar
fernald
fiske
fletcher
french
hancock
holland
howard
longstaff
newcomb
riley
skinner
wright
and
many
others
i
am
glad
to
express
my
obligations
to
all
of
these
for
the
assistance
their
records
have
given
in
the
preparation
of
this
book
while
a
vast
amount
of
knowledge
of
butterflies
has
already
been
discovered
there
is
still
more
to
be
learned
concerning
them
and
throughout
these
pages
i
have
attempted
to
indicate
the
more
important
opportunities
awaiting
investigation
the
day
of
the
field
naturalist
has
come
again
and
the
butterflies
are
well
worthy
of
careful
observations
by
many
interested
students
the
illustrations
in
the
book
require
a
word
of

the
eleven

have
been
made

part
i
introduction
in
popular
esteem
the
butterflies
among
the
insects
are
what
the
birds
are
among
the
higher
animals
the
most
attractive
and
beautiful
members
of
the
great
group
to
which
they
belong
they
are
primarily
day
fliers
and
are
remarkable
for
the
delicacy
and
beauty
of
their
membranous
wings
covered
with
myriads
of
tiny
scales
that
overlap
one
another
like
the
shingles
on
a
house
and
show
an
infinite
variety
of
hue
through
the
coloring
of
the
scales
and
their
arrangement
upon
the
translucent
membrane
running
between
the
wing
veins
it
is
this
characteristic
structure
of
the
wings
that
gives
to
the
great
order
of
butterflies
and
moths
its
name
lepidoptera
meaning
in
the
general
structure
of
the
body
the
butterflies
resemble
other
insects
there
are
three
chief
divisions
head
thorax
and
abdomen
the
head
bears
the
principal
sense
organs
the
thorax
the
organs
of
locomotion
and
the
abdomen
the
organs
of
reproduction
by
examining
a
butterfly
head
through
a
lens
it
is
easy
to
see
the
principal
appendages
which
it
bears
projecting
forward
from
the
middle
of
the
top
is
a
pair
of
long
feelers
or
antennae
each
of
these
consists
of
short
joints
which
in
general
may
be
divided
into
three
groups
first
a
few
large
joints
at
the
base
connecting
the
feeler
with
the
head
second
many
rather
small
joints
which
make
up
the
principal
length
third
several
larger
joints
which
make
up
the
outer
part
or
club
of
the
antennæ
in
the
case
of
the
skippers
there
are
in
addition
a
number
of
small
joints
coming
to
a
sharp
point
at
the
end
of
the
club
just
below
the
insertion
of
the
antennae
on
each
side
of
the
head
are
the
large
compound
eyes
which
are
almost
hemispherical
with
a
powerful
glass
one
can
see
the
facets
of
which
there
are
thousands
making
up
each
eye
just
below
the
eyes
there
are
two
hairy
projections
called
the
palpi
between
which
is
the
coiled
tongue
or
sucking
tube
plate
page
illustration

anatomically
the
thorax
is
divided
into
three
parts
the
prothorax
the
mesathorax
and
the
metathorax
but
the
lines
of
division
between
these
parts
are
not
easily
seen
without
denuding
the
skin
of
its
hairy
covering
the
prothorax
bears
the
first
pair
of
legs
the
mesathorax
bears
the
front
pair
of
wings
and
the
second
pair
of
legs
the
metathorax
bears
the
hind
pair
of
wings
and
the
third
pair
of
legs
in
many
butterflies
the
first
pair
of
legs
are
so
reduced
in
size
that
they
are
not
used
in
walking
the
abdomen
is
composed
of
eight
or
nine
distinct
rings
or
segments
most
of
which
have
two
spiracles
or
breathing
pores
one
on
each
side
it
also
bears
upon
the
end
of
the
body
the
ovipositor
of
the
female
or
the
clasping
organs
of
the
male
butterfly
transformations
the
butterflies
furnish
the
best
known
examples
of
insect
transformations
the
change
from
the
egg
to
the
caterpillar
or
larva
from
the
caterpillar
to
the
pupa
or
chrysalis
and
from
the
chrysalis
to
the
butterfly
or
imago
is
doubtless
the
most
generally
known
fact
concerning
the
life
histories
of
insects
it
is
a
typical
example
of
what
are
called
complete
transformations
as
distinguished
from
the
manner
of
growth
of
grasshoppers
crickets
and
many
other
insects
in
which
the
young
that
hatches
from
the
egg
bears
a
general
resemblance
to
the
adult
and
in
which
there
is
no
quiet
chrysalis
stage
when
the
little
creature
is
unable
to
eat
or
to
move
about

growth
of
the
caterpillars
are
like
snakes
in
at
least
one
respect
in
order
to
provide
for
their
increase
in
size
they
shed
their
skins
when
a
caterpillar
hatches
from
the
egg
it
is
a
tiny
creature
with
a
soft
skin
over
most
of
its
body
but
with
rather
a
firm
covering
for
its
head
while
we
might
fancy
that
there
could
be
a
considerable
increase
in
size
provided
for
by
the
stretching
of
the
soft
skin
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
hard
covering
of
the
head
will
not
admit
of
this
so
the
story
of
the
growth
of
a
caterpillar
may
be
told
in
this
way
a
butterfly
lays
an
egg
upon
a
leaf
some
days
later
the
egg
hatches
into
a
larva
which
is
the
technical
name
for
the
second
stage
of
an
insect
life
in
the
case
of
the
butterfly
we
call
this
larva
a
caterpillar
the
little
caterpillar
is
likely
to
take
its
first
meal
by
eating
the
empty
egg
shell
this
is
a
curious
habit
and
a
really
satisfactory
explanation
of
it
seems
not
to
have
been
made
its
next
meal
is
likely
to
be
taken
from
the
green
tissues
of
the
leaf
commonly
the
green
outer
surface
only
being
eaten
at
this
time
the
future
meals
are
also
taken
from
the
leaf
more
and
more
being
eaten
as
the
larva
gets
older
after
a
few
days
of
this
feeding
upon
the
leaf
tissues
the
little
caterpillar
becomes
so
crowded
within
the
skin
with
which
it
was
born
that
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
larger
one
so
a
new
skin
begins
to
form
beneath
the
first
one
consequently
the
latter
splits
open
in
a
straight
line
part
way
down
the
middle
of
the
back
just
behind
the
head
then
the
new
head
covering
is
withdrawn
from
the
old
one
and
the
caterpillar
wriggles
its
way
out
of
the
split
skin
and
finds
itself
clothed
in
a
new
one
at
first
all
of
the
tissues
of
the
new
skin
are
soft
and
pliable
and
they
easily
take
on
a
larger
size
as
the
body
of
the
caterpillar
expands
a
little
later
these
tissues
become
hardened
and
no
further
expansion
is
possible
this
process
of
is
called
moulting
the
cast
skin
is
often
called
the
exuviae
the
period
of
the
caterpillar
life
between
the
hatching
from
the
egg
and
this
moult
is
often
called
a
stage
or
instar
that
is
the
caterpillar
up
to
the
time
of
this
moult
is
living
in
the
first
caterpillar
stage
or
instar
during
the
actual
moulting
the
caterpillar
is
quite
active
in
freeing
itself
from
the
exuviae
but
as
soon
as
it
is
free
it
is
likely
to
rest
quietly
for
some
hours
while
the
tissues
of
the
new
skin
are
hardening
then
it
begins
feeding
upon
the
leaf
again
and
continues
taking
its
meals
at
more
or
less
regular
intervals
for
several
days
by
that
time
it
will
again
have
reached
its
limit
of
growth
within
this
second
skin
and
the
process
of
moulting
must
be
repeated
it
takes
place
in
the
same
way
as
before
and
the
caterpillar
enters
upon
the
third
instar
of
its
larval
life
this
process
of
feeding
and
moulting
is
continued
for
several
weeks
the
number
of
moults
being
usually
four
during
the
later
stages
the
increase
in
size
is
more
marked
each
time
the
skin
is
shed
until
the
caterpillar
finally
reaches
its
full
growth
as
a
larva
and
is
ready
for
the
wonderful
change
to
the
quiet
chrysalis
in
which
all
its
caterpillar
organs
are
to
be
transformed
into
the
very
different
organs
of
the
butterfly
in
the
case
of
butterfly
larvae
one
of
the
most
interesting
features
of
the
growth
of
the
caterpillar
is
that
of
the
remarkable
changes
in
colors
and
patterns
of
marking
which
the
caterpillar
undergoes
one
who
had
not
followed
these
changes
would
often
be
at
a
loss
to
recognize
caterpillars
of
slightly
differing
sizes
as
belonging
to
the
same
species
these
changes
commonly
show
a
remarkable
adaptation
to
the
conditions
of
life
and
generally
tend
to
the
concealment
of
the
caterpillar
upon
its
food
plant
the
stages
of
growth
of
the
swallowtail
caterpillar
are
illustrated
on
plate
opposite
page
before
each
moult
the
caterpillar
is
likely
to
spin
a
silken
web
upon
the
leaf
surface
it
then
entangles
its
claws
in
the
web
to
hold
itself
in
place
while
the
skin
is
cast
plate
page
change
to
the
plate
pages
a
week
or
ten
days
after
the
last
moult
of
its
caterpillar
growth
the
larva
commonly
becomes
full
fed
and
ready
to
change
to
the
chrysalis
state
the
details
of
the
way
in
which
this
is
accomplished
vary
greatly
with
different
butterflies
as
will
be
noted
in
the
stories
of
many
species
later
in
this
book
in
general
however
the
caterpillar
provides
a
web
of
silk
which
it
spins
against
some
surface
where
the
chrysalis
will
be
secure
and
in
this
web
it
entangles
its
hind
legs
sometimes
there
is
the
additional
protection
of
a
loop
of
silk
over
the
front
end
of
the
body
after
the
legs
have
become
entangled
the
caterpillar
hangs
downward
until
the
skin
splits
open
along
the
median
line
of
the
back
and
gradually
shrinks
upward
until
it
is
almost
free
showing
as
it
comes
off
a
curious
creature
which
has
some
of
the
characteristic
features
of
a
chrysalis
it
is
seldom
at
this
stage
of
the
same
shape
as
the
chrysalis
when
the
caterpillar
skin
is
nearly
off
this
object
usually
wriggles
its
body
quickly
in
a
manner
to
entangle
a
curious
set
of
hooks
attached
to
the
upper
end
in
the
web
of
silken
thread
this
projection
is
called
the
cremaster
and
it
serves
a
very
important
purpose
in
holding
the
chrysalis
in
position
illustration

chrysalis
showing
the

of

after
riley
as
soon
as
the
cremaster
is
entangled
in
the
web
the
cast
skin
usually
falls
off
and
for
a
very
short
period
the
creature
hanging
seems
to
be
neither
caterpillar
nor
chrysalis
it
is
in
fact
in
a
transition
stage
between
the
two
and
it
very
soon
shortens
up
and
takes
on
the
definite
form
of
the
chrysalis
the
outer
tissues
hardening
into
the
characteristic
chrysalis
skin
from
the
fact
that
this
chrysalis
skin
shows
many
of
the
characteristic
features
of
the
future
butterfly
it
is
evident
that
the
change
from
the
caterpillar
to
the
butterfly
really
began
during
the
life
of
the
larva
the
nature
of
the
process
by
which
this
change
takes
place
has
long
been
a
puzzle
to
scientists
for
the
making
of
a
butterfly
is
one
of
the
most
wonderful
phenomena
in
the
outer
world
and
it
has
challenged
the
attention
of
many
acute
observers
some
two
centuries
ago
the
great
dutch
naturalist
swammerdam
studied
very
carefully
the
development
of
many
insects
especially
the
butterfly
he
found
that
if
he
placed
in
boiling
water
a
caterpillar
that
was
ready
to
pupate
or
become
a
chrysalis
the
outer
skin
could
easily
be
removed
revealing
beneath
the
immature
butterfly
with
legs
and
antennae
from
these
observations
he
was
led
to
believe
that
the
process
of
growth
was
simply
a
process
of
unfolding
that
is
as
professor
packard
has
expressed
it
that
the
form
of
the
larva
pupa
and
imago
preëxisted
in
the
egg
and
even
in
the
ovary
and
that
the
insects
in
these
stages
were
distinct
animals
contained
one
inside
the
other
like
a
nest
of
boxes
or
a
series
of
envelopes
one
within
the
other
this
was
called
the
incasement
theory
and
it
was
held
to
be
correct
by
naturalists
for
nearly
a
century
it
was
discredited
however
about
a
hundred
years
ago
but
not
until
another
fifty
years
had
passed
was
it
definitely
replaced
by
another
and
much
more
convincing
theory
propounded
by
weismann
according
to
weismann
theory
which
is
now
the
process
of
development
internally
is
a
much
more
continuous
one
than
the
external
changes
would
indicate
so
far
as
the
latter
are
concerned
we
simply
say
that
a
caterpillar
changes
to
a
chrysalis
and
a
chrysalis
to
a
butterfly
the
transition
in
each
case
requiring
but
a
very
short
time
internally
however
it
has
been
going
on
almost
continuously
from
the
early
life
of
the
caterpillar
the
various
organs
of
the
butterfly
arise
from
certain
germinal
disks
or
imaginal
buds
the
word
imaginal
in
this
case
being
an
adjective
form
of
imago
so
that
the
imaginal
buds
are
really
simply
buds
for
the
starting
of
growth
of
the
various
organs
of
the
imago
or
adult
as
the
caterpillars
approach
the
chrysalis
period
these
imaginal
buds
rapidly
develop
into
the
various
organs
of
the
butterfly
this
process
is
helped
along
by
the
breaking
down
of
many
of
the
tissues
of
the
larva
this
tissue
being
then
utilized
for
the
production
of
the
new
organs
about
the
time
the
chrysalis
is
formed
this
process
becomes
very
general
so
that
the
newly
formed
chrysalis
seems
largely
a
mass
of
creamy
material
which
is
soon
used
to
build
up
the
various
parts
of
the
butterfly
through
the
growth
of
the
imaginal
buds
change
to
the
plate
pages
there
is
probably
no
phenomenon
in
the
world
of
living
creatures
which
has
attracted
more
attention
than
the
change
of
the
chrysalis
into
the
butterfly
it
is
not
strange
that
this
is
so
we
see
upon
a
tree
or
shrub
or
wall
an
inert
apparently
lifeless
object
having
no
definite
form
with
which
we
can
compare
it
with
other
things
having
neither
eyes
nor
ears
nor
wings
nor
legs
an
object
apparently
of
as
little
interest
as
a
lifeless
piece
of
rock
a
few
minutes
later
we
behold
it
again
and
note
with
astonishment
that
this
apparently
inanimate
being
has
been
suddenly
transformed
into
the
most
ethereal
of
the
creatures
of
earth
with
an
exquisite
beauty
that
can
not
fail
to
attract
admiration
with
wings
of
most
delicate
structure
for
flying
through
the
air
with
eyes
of
a
thousand
facets
with
organs
of
smell
that
baffle
the
ingenuity
of
man
to
explain
with
vibrant
antennae
and
a
slender
tongue
adapted
to
feeding
upon
the
nectar
of
flowers
the
most
ambrosial
of
natural
food
so
it
is
not
strange
that
this
emergence
of
a
butterfly
has
long
been
the
theme
both
of
poets
and
theologians
and
that
it
attracts
the
admiring
attention
of
childhood
youth
and
age
fortunately
this
change
from
chrysalis
to
butterfly
may
readily
be
observed
by
any
one
who
will
take
a
little
trouble
to
rear
the
caterpillars
or
to
watch
chrysalids
found
outdoors
the
precise
method
of
eclosion
as
we
call
this
new
kind
of
hatching
varies
somewhat
with
different
species
but
in
general
the
process
is
similar
in
all
those
chrysalids
which
have
a
light
colored
outer
skin
are
especially
desirable
if
we
would
watch
this
process
one
can
see
through
the
membrane
the
developing
butterfly
within
until
finally
just
before
it
is
ready
to
break
out
the
markings
of
the
wings
and
body
show
distinctly
if
at
this
time
the
chrysalis
is
placed
in
the
sunshine
it
is
likely
to
come
out
at
once
so
that
you
can
observe
it
readily
it
usually
breaks
apart
over
the
head
and
the
newly
released
legs
quickly
grasp
hold
of
the
empty
skin
as
well
as
of
the
support
to
which
it
is
attached
it
then
hangs
downward
with
a
very
large
abdomen
and
with
the
wings
more
or
less
crumpled
up
but
decidedly
larger
than
when
they
were
confined
within
the
chrysalis
the
wings
however
soon
begin
to
lengthen
as
they
are
stretched
out
probably
through
the
filling
of
the
space
by
the
body
juices
commonly
the
hind
pair
of
wings
become
full
size
before
the
front
ones
in
a
short
time
the
wings
attain
their
full
size
the
abdomen
becomes
smaller
through
the
discharge
of
a
liquid
called
meconium
and
the
butterfly
is
likely
to
walk
a
few
steps
to
a
better
position
where
it
will
rest
quietly
for
an
hour
or
two
while
body
and
wing
tissues
harden
after
this
it
is
likely
to
fly
away
to
lead
the
free
life
of
a
butterfly

these
changes
from

to
chrysalis
and
from
chrysalis
to
adult
in
the
case
of
the
monarch
butterfly
are
illustrated
on
the
plates
opposite

a
little
study
of
these
photographs
from
life
will
help
greatly
to
an
understanding
of
the
process
some
very
interesting
observations
have
been
made
by
alston
moffat
upon
the
method
of
the
expansion
of
the
wings
in
summarizing
his
investigations
he
writes
when
a
wing
is
fully
expanded
and
for
an
hour
or
two
after
the
membranes
can
be
easily
separated
entrance
for
a
between
them
is
to
be
found
at
the
base
of
the
wing
where
the
subcostal
and
median
nervures
come
close
together
the
membranes
are
united
at
the
costal
and
inner
edges
which
have
to
be
cut
to
get
them
apart
but
they
are
free
at
the
outer
angle
at
that
time
the
nervures
are
in
two
parts
half
in
one
membrane
and
half
in
the
other
and
open

the
centre
the
fluid
which
has
been
stored
up
in
the
pupa
enters
the
winglet
at
the
opening
referred
to
expanding
the
membranes
as
it
passes
along
between
them
and
the
nervures
at
the
same
time
and
when
it
has
extended
to
every
portion
of
the
wing
then
it
is
fully
expanded
the
expanding
fluid
is
of
a
gummy
consistency

as
it
dries
cements
the
membranes
together

edges
of

produces

are
so
familiar
butterflies
and
moths
the
butterflies
and
moths
both
belong
to
the
great
order
of
insects
the
lepidoptera
they
are
distinguished
however
by
certain
general
characteristics
which
hold
true
for
the
most
part
in
both
groups

butterflies

by
day
the
moths
fly
by
night
all
of
the
higher
butterflies
go
into

without
making
a
silken
cocoon

most
of
the
higher
moths
make
such
a
cocoon
the
bodies
of
the
butterflies
are
usually
slender

those
of
the
larger

are

resting
upon
the
silken
cocoon
in
which
it
spent
its
period
as
a

cocoon
was
attached
by
the

large

very
suggestive
of
those
of

have
the
characteristic

the
crescent
marks
in

are

often
found
on

some
of
these
large
moths
on
cloudy
days
occasionally
fly
during
daylight
and
by
the
uninitiated
they
are
often
mistaken
for
large
butterflies
one
who
will
notice
their
structure
however
will
readily
see
the
characteristic
features
of
the
moth
in
the
caterpillar
stage

are
no
hard
and
fast
differences
between
the
larvae

butterflies

the
scents
of
butterflies
many
students
of
american
butterflies
have
occasionally
mentioned
the
fact
that
certain
species
seem
to
give
off
a
distinct
scent
which
has
frequently
been
spoken
of
as
a
pleasing
fragrance
suggesting
sandalwood
or
some
other
aromatic
odor
the
general
subject
as
exemplified
by
butterflies
of
other
lands
has
been
studied
for
many
years
by
fritz
müller
and
certain
english
entomologists
have
paid
considerable
attention
to
it
a
translation
of
the
müller
publications
and
an
excellent
summary
of
our
present
knowledge
of
the
subject
is
published
in
longstaff
book
on
butterfly
hunting
the
odors
given
off
by
butterflies
are
divided
into
two
principal
kinds
namely
first
those
which
are
repulsive
to
the
senses
of
man
and
evidently
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
butterflies
from
birds
and
other
vertebrate
enemies
these
are
found
in
both
sexes
second
those
which
are
evidently
for
the
purpose
of
sexual
attraction
and
confined
to
the
male
butterflies
these
scents
are
usually
attractive
to
the
senses

androconia
from
wings
of
male
butterflies
the
aromatic
scents
of
the
second
group
are
generally
produced
by
means
of
certain
scales
or
hairs
of
many
curious
forms
which
are
scattered
over
the
surface
of
the
wings
or
are
placed
within
certain
special
pockets
generally
near
the
borders
of
the
wings
these
scales
or
hairs
are
called
androconia
some
of
them
much
magnified
are
represented
in
the
picture
above
our
knowledge
of
the
scents
given
off
by
american
butterflies
is
very
fragmentary
and
it
is
highly
desirable
that
many
more
observations
should
be
made
upon
the
subject
if
collectors
generally
would
make
careful
notes
both
in
the
field
and
upon
the
freshly
killed
butterflies
at
home
we
ought
soon
to
be
able
greatly
to
extend
our
knowledge
by
holding
the
butterfly
with
a
pair
of
forceps
one
can
often
determine
whether
the
fragrance
is
emitted
it
is
often
helpful
also
to
brush
the
hairs
or
tufts
where
the
androconia
are
attached

butterfly
migrations
migration
seems
to
be
a
general
instinct
in
the
animal
world
developed
when
a
species
becomes
enormously
abundant
at
such
times
this
instinct
apparently
overcomes
all
others
and
the
creatures
move
on
regardless
of
obstacles
and
conditions
that
may
mean
certain
death
to
the
vast
majority
such
migrations
among
mammals
have
often
been
recorded
one
of
the
most
notable
examples
being
that
of
the
little
lemmings
which
migrate
at
periodical
intervals
in
a
way
which
has
often
been
described
among
the
insects
such
migrations
have
been
frequently
noticed
and
the
phenomenon
has
apparently
been
observed
oftener
among
the
butterflies
than
in
any
other
group
entomological
literature
during
the
last
hundred
years
contains
a
great
many
records
of
enormous
flights
of
butterflies
over
long
distances
extending
even
from
africa
into
europe
or
from
one
part
of
america
to
another
far
remote
as
such
migration
is
likely
to
happen
whenever
a
species
becomes
extremely
abundant
it
probably
is
nature
way
of
providing
for
an
extended
food
supply
for
the
succeeding
generations
that
it
results
in
the
death
of
the
great
majority
of
the
migrants
is
doubtless
true
but
it
must
lead
to
vast
experiments
in
extending
the
geographic
area
inhabited
by
these
species
numerous
examples
of
such
migrating
swarms
will
be
found
in

the
migrations
thus
considered
are
only
exceptional
occurrences
there
is
however
a
regularly
recurring
annual
migration
on
the
part
of
some
butterflies
which
is
also
a
phenomenon
of
extraordinary
interest
the
most
notable
example
is
that
of
the
monarch
which
apparently
follows
the
birds
southward
every
autumn
and
comes
northward
again
in
spring
there
is
much
evidence
to
indicate
that
in
some
slight
degree
other
butterflies
have
a
similar
habit
although
the
present
observations
are
inadequate
to
determine
to
what
extent
this
habit
has
become
fixed
in
most
of
these
species
hibernation
or
winter
lethargy
the
ways
in
which
butterflies
spend
the
winter
are
always
of
peculiar
interest
to
the
naturalist
here
are
creatures
with
four
distinct
stages
of
existence
each
of
which
has
the
possibility
of
carrying
the
species
through
the
season
of
cold
it
is
necessary
to
learn
for
each
insect
which
stage
has
been
chosen
for
the
purpose
and
if
possible
to
find
the
reasons
for
the
choice
as
a
rule
the
related
members
of
a
group
are
likely
to
hibernate
in
a
similar
stage
thus
most
of
the
swallowtails
pass
the
winter
as
chrysalids
while
practically
all
the
pass
the
winter
as
adults
this
rule
however
has
many
exceptions
for
one
will
often
find
closely
related
species
which
differ
in
the
stage
of
hibernation
as
one
would
expect
the
conditions
of
hibernation
vary
greatly
with
the
latitude
in
the
severe
climate
of
the
far
north
the
conditions
are
likely
to
be
more
uniform
than
in
the
south
where
the
milder
climate
permits
greater
variation
to
the
insect
in
some
cases
where
a
butterfly
hibernates
in
only
one
stage
in
canada
it
may
pass
the
winter
in
two
or
more
stages
in
alabama
or
florida
in
many
other
orders
of
insects
the
egg
is
a
favorite
stage
for
hibernation
even
in
the
closely
related
moths
it
is
often
chosen
by
many
species
but
comparatively
few
butterflies
pass
the
winter
in
the
egg
stage
the
little
bronze
copper
may
serve
as
one
example
of
this
limited
group
the
conditions
as
to
hibernation
by
the
larvae
of
butterflies
are
very
different
from
those
of
the
egg
it
has
been
estimated
that
probably
half
of
all
our
species
pass
the
winter
in
some
stage
of
caterpillar
growth
this
varies
all
the
way
from
the
newly
hatched
caterpillar
which
hibernates
without
tasting
food
to
the
fully
grown
caterpillar
which
hibernates
full
fed
and
changes
to
a
chrysalis
in
spring
without
eating
anything
at
that
time
a
large
proportion
however
feed
both
in
fall
and
spring
going
through
the
winter
when
approximately
half
grown
the
graylings
and
the
fritillaries
are
typical
examples
of
butterflies
which
hibernate
as
newly
hatched
larvae
the
eggs
are
laid
in
autumn
upon
or
near
the
food
plants
and
the
caterpillars
gnaw
their
way
out
of
the
shells
and
seek
seclusion
at
once
finding
such
shelter
as
they
may
in
the
materials
on
the
soil
surface
in
spring
they
begin
to
feed
as
soon
as
the
weather
permits
and
complete
their
growth
from
then
on
the
caterpillars
may
hibernate
either
as
free
creatures
under
boards
stones
or
in
the
turfy
grass
or
they
may
be
protected
by
special
shelters
which
they
have
provided
for
themselves
in
their
earlier
life
in
the
case
of
the
latter
each
may
have
a
shelter
of
its
own
or
there
may
be
a
common
shelter
for
a
colony
of
caterpillars
among
the
examples
of
those
hibernating
in
miscellaneous
situations
without
special
protection
the
caterpillars
of
the
tawny
emperor
the
gray
emperor
the
pearl
crescent
and
some
of
the
graylings
are
examples
among
those
which
hibernate
in
individual
shelters
the
sovereigns
among
which
our
common
viceroy
is
most
familiar
are
good
examples
among
those
which
hibernate
in
a
tent
woven
by
the
whole
colony
for
the
whole
colony
the
baltimore
or
phaeton
butterfly
is
perhaps
the
best
example
the
caterpillars
that
hibernate
when
full
grown
may
be
grouped
in
a
way
somewhat
similar
to
those
which
are
half
grown
many
species
simply
find
such
shelter
as
they
may
at
or
near
the
soil
surface
the
clouded
sulphur
is
a
good
example
of
these
others
pass
the
winter
in
individual
shelters
made
from
a
leaf
or
blade
several
of
the
larger
skippers
are
good
examples
of
this
condition
so
far
as
i
know
none
of
our
species
pass
the
winter
in
colonial
shelters
when
full
grown
it
would
be
natural
to
suppose
that
the
great
majority
of
butterflies
would
be
likely
to
hibernate
in
the
chrysalis
state
here
is
a
quiet
stage
in
which
the
insect
is
unable
to
move
about
or
to
take
any
food
in
which
it
seems
entirely
dormant
and
as
a
rule
is
fairly
well
hidden
from
the
view
of
enemies
we
find
however
that
only
a
rather
small
proportion
of
our
butterflies
has
chosen
this
stage
for
survival
through
the
winter
the
most
conspicuous
examples
are
the
swallowtails
nearly
all
of
which
hibernate
in
the
chrysalis
stage
other
examples
are
the
various
whites
the
and
isolated
species
like
the
wanderer
and
the
spring
azure
and
the
american
copper
practically
all
the
butterflies
that
pass
the
winter
as
chrysalids
have
a
silken
loop
running
around
near
the
middle
of
the
body
which
helps
to
hold
them
securely
through
the
long
winter
months
apparently
none
of
those
chrysalids
which
hang
straight
downward
are
able
to
survive
the
winter
an
adult
butterfly
seems
a
fragile
creature
to
endure
the
long
cold
months
of
arctic
regions
yet
many
of
our
most
beautiful
species
habitually
hibernate
as
adults
finding
shelter
in
such
situations
as
hollow
trees
the
crevices
in
rocks
the
openings
beneath
loose
bark
or
even
the
outer
bark
on
the
under
side
of
a
large
branch
it
is
significant
that
most
of
the
are
northern
rather
than
southern
species
some
of
them
being
found
in
arctic
regions
practically
around
the
world
one
of
the
few
southern
forms
that
hibernates
as
an
adult
is
the
goatweed
emperor
these
examples
are
all
cases
of
true
hibernation
in
a
lethargic
condition
there
are
certain
butterflies
however
which
pass
the
winter
as
adults
that
remain
active
during
this
period
obviously
this
is
impossible
in
latitudes
where
the
winter
is
severe
and
it
involves
migration
to
a
warmer
climate
the
one
notable
illustration
of
this
is
the
monarch
butterfly
which
apparently
flies
southward
to
the
gulf
states
at
least
and
there
remains
until
spring
when
individuals
come
north
again
the
southward
migration
may
be
begun
in
canada
when
the
butterflies
gather
together
in
enormous
flocks
that
remind
one
of
the
gathering
of
the
clans
with
the
migrating
birds
this
is
one
of
the
least
understood
of
insect
activities
but
it
has
been
observed
so
often
and
over
so
long
a
period
of
years
that
there
seems
to
be
no
questioning
the
general
habit
like
everything
else
in
relation
to
living
things
there
are
numerous
variations
in
the
prevailing
modes
of
hibernation
in
the
case
of
many
species
one
can
find
combinations
of
two
or
more
stages
in
which
the
winter
is
passed
probably
if
we
could
observe
with
sufficient
care
we
might
be
able
to
find
somewhere
examples
of
almost
any
conceivable
double
combination
as
egg
with
larva
or
chrysalis
or
adult
the
insect
hibernating
in
two
of
these
stages
many
examples
are
known
in
which
both
chrysalis
and
adult
of
the
same
species
pass
the
winter
and
also
of
those
in
which
young
and
larvae
pass
the
winter
as
one
would
expect
the
conditions
as
to
such
combinations
are
likely
to
be
more
variable
in
southern
than
in
northern
regions
notwithstanding
all
the
attention
which
has
been
paid
to
butterfly
there
is
still
some
uncertainty
in
regard
to
the
hibernation
of
many
of
our
species
one
of
the
most
interesting
series
of
observations
which
a
young
naturalist
could
undertake
would
be
to
learn
positively
how
each
species
of
butterfly
in
his
locality
passes
the
winter
aestivation
or
summer
lethargy
in
some
species
of
butterflies
there
is
a
special
adaptation
to
passing
through
the
hottest
part
of
the
summer
season
in
a
state
of
lethargy
which
is
suggestive
of
the
torpor
of
the
hibernating
period
this
phase
of
butterfly
existence
has
not
been
extensively
studied
and
there
are
indications
that
it
exists
more
generally
than
has
been
commonly
supposed
it
has
been
noticed
even
in
northern
new
england
that
some
of
the
seek
shelter
and
become
lethargic
during
august
apparently
this
is
an
adaptation
to
single
broodedness
helping
to
carry
the
species
through
the
year
without
the
exhaustion
incident
to
the
continued
activity
of
the
butterfly
in
more
southern
regions
especially
in
the
hot
dry
climates
where
vegetation
withers
in
midsummer
it
is
well
known
that
some
caterpillars
become
lethargic
remaining
inactive
until
the
fall
rains
start
vegetation
into
growth
the
butterfly
is
a
good
example
of
this
this
summer
lethargy
offers
excellent
opportunity
for
careful
study
any
observer
who
finds
a
butterfly
hidden
away
in
summer
under
boards
the
bark
of
a
tree
or
in
a
stone
pile
should
look
carefully
to
see
what
species
it
is
and
how
the
butterfly
behaves
such
observations
should
be
sent
to
the
entomological
journals
in
order
that
our
knowledge
of
the
subject
may
be
increased
feigning
death
the
fact
has
long
been
noticed
that
various
butterflies
have
the
habit
at
times
of
feigning
death
and
dropping
to
the
ground
where
they
may
lie
motionless
for
a
considerable
period
this
habit
is
most
easily
observed
in
some
of
the
especially
those
which
hibernate
as
adults
those
species
have
the
under
surfaces
of
their
wings
colored
in
various
patterns
and
apparently
live
through
the
winter
to
some
extent
resting
beneath
the
bark
of
large
branches
or
upon
the
trunks
of
trees
many
of
them
also
secrete
themselves
in
hollow
trees
or
beneath
loose
bark
or
in
board
piles
or
stone
walls
it
is
probable
however
that
during
the
long
ages
when
these
insects
were
adapting
themselves
to
their
life
conditions
before
man
interfered
with
the
natural
order
and
furnished
various
more
or
less
artificial
places
for
hibernation
these
butterflies
rested
more
generally
upon
the
under
side
of
branches
than
they
do
now
even
in
warm
weather
when
one
of
these
butterflies
is
suddenly
disturbed
it
is
likely
to
fold
its
legs
upon
its
body
and
drop
to
the
ground
allowing
itself
to
be
handled
without
showing
any
signs
of
life
this
habit
is
doubtless
of
value
especially
during
hibernation
or
possibly
during
the
summer
lethargy
or
aestivation
the
latter
a
habit
which
may
be
more
general
among
these
butterflies
than
is
now
supposed
as
the
insect
lies
motionless
upon
the
ground
it
is
very
likely
to
blend
so
thoroughly
with
its
surroundings
that
it
becomes
concealed
and
any
bird
which
had
startled
it
from
the
branch
above
would
have
difficulty
in
finding
it
some
very
interesting
observations
have
been
made
upon
the
instincts
of
various
other
insects
especially
the
beetles
but
no
one
so
far
as
i
know
has
yet
made
an
extended
study
of
the
subject
in
relation
to
our
american
butterflies
it
is
an
excellent
field
for
investigation
and
offers
unusual
opportunities
for
photographic
records
one
of
the
pictures
opposite
page
shows
a
photograph
which
i
took
of
a
mourning
cloak
as
it
was
thus
playing
this
species
exhibits
the
instinct
to
a
marked
degree
coloration
the
caterpillars
of
butterflies
and
moths
form
a
large
part
of
the
food
of
birds
these
caterpillars
are
especially
adapted
for
such
a
purpose
and
in
the
economy
of
nature
they
play
a
very
important
part
in
keeping
alive
the
feathered
tribes
during
the
long
ages
through
which
both
birds
and
insects
have
been
developing
side
by
side
there
have
been
many
remarkable
established
which
tend
on
the
one
hand
to
prevent
the
birds
from
exterminating
the
insects
and
on
the
other
to
prevent
the
insects
from
causing
the
birds
to
starve
the
most
important
of
these
so
far
as
the
caterpillars
are
concerned
are
the
various
devices
by
which
these
insects
protect
themselves
from
attack
by
hiding
away
where
birds
are
not
likely
to
find
them
by
clothing
their
bodies
with
spiny
hairs
by
other
methods
of
rendering
themselves
distasteful
or
by
various
phases
of
concealing
coloration
on
the
whole
the
examples
of
the
latter
are
not
so
numerous
or
so
easily
found
in
the
case
of
the
larvae
of
butterflies
as
in
those
of
moths
perhaps
the
basal
principle
of
concealing
coloration
is
the
law
of
first
partially
announced
by
poulton
and
later
much
more
elaborately
worked
out
by
abbott
thayer
and
discussed
at
length
by
gerald
thayer
in
his
remarkable
volume
concealing
coloration
in
the
animal
kingdom
the
law
of
is
tersely
stated
in
these
words
animals
are
painted
by
nature
darkest
on
those
parts
which
tend
to
be
most
lighted
by
the
sky
light
and
as
this
law
works
out
on
most
animals
that
live
on
or
near
the
ground
the
upper
part
of
the
body
exposed
to
the
direct
light
from
above
is
dark
and
the
under
part
shut
off
from
the
upper
light
and
receiving
only
the
small
reflection
from
below
is
enough
lighter
to
make
the
appearance
of
the
creature
in
its
natural
environment
of
a
uniform
tone
from
back
to
breast
nearly
all
caterpillars
illustrate
this
law
of
if
they
are
in
the
habit
of
feeding
or
resting
with
their
feet
downward
the
back
will
be
darker
and
the
under
side
lighter
but
if
they
are
in
the
habit
of
feeding
or
resting
in
the
opposite
position
these
color
tones
will
be
reversed
one
can
find
examples
of
such
conditions
almost
any
summer
day
by
a
little
searching
of
trees
or
shrubs
this
law
of
however
is
really
only
the
basis
for
the
coloration
of
caterpillars
or
other
animals
it
tends
chiefly
to
make
the
creature
appear
as
a
flat
plane
when
seen
from
the
side
and
may
be
said
in
a
way
to
prepare
the
canvas
upon
which
nature
paints
her
more
distinctive
pictures
a
great
many
examples
of
color
markings
that
tend
to
conceal
the
caterpillar
amid
its
natural
surroundings
may
be
found
by
any
one
who
will
study
the
subject
and
it
offers
one
of
the
most
interesting
fields
for
investigation
the
chapter
on
caterpillars
in
the
book
by
thayer
should
serve
as
a
starting
point
for
any
one
taking
up
the
subject
butterflies
differ
from
caterpillars
and
from
most
other
animals
in
the
fact
that
their
coloring
is
chiefly
shown
upon
the
flat
surfaces
of
the
wings
consequently
there
is
less
opportunity
for
the
various
phases
of
which
is
so
commonly
shown
in
the
larger
caterpillars
the
bodies
of
nearly
all
butterflies
do
exhibit
this
phenomenon
but
these
bodies
are
relatively
so
small
that
plays
but
a
little
part
in
the
general
display
upon
the
outstretched
membranes
of
the
butterflies
wings
nature
through
the
long
ages
of
development
has
painted
a
great
variety
of
pictures
those
which
tend
to
protect
the
insect
by
concealment
amid
its
surroundings
are
most
commonly
spread
on
the
under
surface
of
the
wings
especially
is
this
true
in
the
case
of
those
species
which
pass
the
winter
as
adults
or
which
have
the
habit
of
resting
upon
the
bark
of
trees
the
sides
of
rocks
or
the
surface
of
the
ground
we
here
find
some
of
the
most
interesting
examples
of
obliterative
coloring
that
occur
in
nature
some
butterflies
have
taken
on
the
look
of
tree
bark
others
the
sombre
appearance
of
weathered
rocks
while
still
others
are
painted
with
the
images
of
flowerets
and
their
stems
and
eclipsing
many
of
the
butterflies
especially
the
which
are
marked
on
the
under
surface
in
various
protective
colors
are
admirable
examples
of
that
phase
of
animal
coloring
which
is
spoken
of
as
this
is
apparently
one
of
the
most
important
protective
devices
to
be
found
in
nature
and
the
validity
of
it
is
now
generally
conceded
by
naturalists
one
phase
of
it
which
may
be
called
eclipsing
coloration
seems
to
have
been
first
definitely
formulated
by
the
late
lord
walsingham
a
famous
english
entomologist
who
enunciated
it
in
an
address
as
president
of
the
entomological
society
of
london
the
most
significant
paragraphs
in
that
address
were
these
my
attention
was
lately
drawn
to
a
passage
in
herbert
on
the
morals
of
trade
he
writes
when
tasting
different
foods
or
wines
the
palate
is
disabled
by
something
strongly
flavored
from
appreciating
the
more
delicate
flavor
of
another
thing
afterward
taken
so
with
the
other
organs
of
sense
a
temporary
disability
follows
an
excessive
stimulation
this
holds
not
only
with
the
eyes
in
judging
of
colors
but
also
with
the
fingers
in
judging
of
texture
here
i
think
we
have
an
explanation
of
the
principle
on
which
protection
is
undoubtedly
afforded
to
certain
insects
by
the
possession
of
bright
coloring
on
such
parts
of
their
wings
or
bodies
as
can
be
instantly
covered
and
concealed
at
will
it
is
an
undoubted
fact
and
one
which
must
have
been
observed
by
nearly
all
collectors
of
insects
abroad
and
perhaps
also
in
our
own
country
that
it
is
more
easy
to
follow
with
the
eye
the
rapid
movements
of
a
more
conspicuous
insect
soberly
and
uniformly
colored
than
those
of
an
insect
capable
of
changing
in
an
instant
the
appearance
it
presents
the
eye
having
once
fixed
itself
upon
an
object
of
a
certain
form
and
color
conveys
to
the
mind
a
corresponding
impression
and
if
that
impression
is
suddenly
found
to
be
unreliable
the
instruction
which
the
mind
conveys
to
the
eye
becomes
also
unreliable
and
the
rapidity
with
which
the
impression
and
consequent
instruction
can
be
changed
can
not
always
compete
successfully
with
the
rapid
transformation
effected
by
the
insect
in
its
effort
to
escape
lord
walsingham
then
goes
on
to
suggest
that
this
intermittent
play
of
bright
colors
probably
has
as
confusing
effect
upon
birds
and
other
predaceous
vertebrates
as
upon
man
and
that
on
this
hypothesis
such
colors
can
be
accounted
for
more
satisfactorily
than
upon
any
other
yet
suggested
since
then
the
significance
of
this
theory
has
been
repeatedly
pointed
out
by
professor
poulton
abbott
thayer
and
various
other
authorities
upon
animal
coloring
the
terms
and
have
been
applied
to
the
phenomenon
shortly
after
lord
walsingham
propounded
this
theory
i
called
attention
a
to
its
fitness
in
explaining
some
of
the
most
interesting
color
phases
shown
by
american
insects
notably
the
moths
and
locusts
which
have
brilliantly
colored
under
wings
and
protectively
colored
upper
wings
a
science
a
game
of
hide
and
seek
reprinted
in
the
the
animals
of
the
north
show
numberless
color
phases
of
interest
one
of
the
most
curious
of
these
is
exhibited
by
several
families
of
insects
in
which
the
outer
wings
are
protectively
colored
in
dull
hues
and
the
under
wings
brightly
colored
for
example
there
are
many
species
of
moths
belonging
to
the
genus
catocala
found
throughout
the
united
states
these
are
insects
of
good
size
the
larger
ones
measuring
three
inches
in
expanse
of
wings
and
the
majority
of
them
being
at
least
two
thirds
that
size
most
of
them
live
during
the
day
on
the
bark
of
trees
with
their
front
wings
folded
together
over
the
back
the
colors
and
markings
of
these
wings
as
well
as
of
the
rest
of
the
exposed
portions
of
the
body
are
such
as
to
assimilate
closely
with
the
bark
of
the
tree
upon
which
the
insect
rests
in
such
a
situation
it
requires
a
sharp
eye
to
detect
the
presence
of
the
moth
which
unless
disturbed
flies
only
at
night
remaining
all
day
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
many
enemies
probably
the
most
important
of
these
are
the
birds
especially
species
like
the
woodpeckers
which
are
constantly
exploring
all
portions
of
the
trunks
of
trees
the
chief
beauty
of
these
catocalas
as
they
are
seen
spread
out
in
the
museum
cabinet
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
hind
wings
which
when
the
moth
is
at
rest
in
life
are
concealed
by
the
front
ones
are
brightly
colored
in
contrasting
hues
of
black
red
and
white
in
various
brilliant
combinations
these
colors
in
connection
with
the
soft
and
blended
tones
of
the
front
wings
make
a
very
handsome
insect
it
is
easy
to
see
that
when
one
of
these
underwing
moths
is
driven
to
flight
by
a
woodpecker
or
other
bird
it
would
show
during
its
rapid
irregular
flight
the
bright
colors
of
the
under
wings
which
would
be
instantly
hidden
upon
alighting
and
the
very
different
coloring
of
the
upper
wings
blending
with
the
bark
would
be
substituted
consequently
the
bird
would
be
very
likely
to
be
baffled
in
its
pursuit
of
on
the
rocky
hills
and
sandy
plains
of
new
england
there
are
several
species
of
grasshoppers
or
locusts
that
also
illustrate
these
principles
if
you
walk
along
a
strip
of
sandy
land
in
summer
you
start
to
flight
certain
locusts
which
soon
alight
and
when
searched
for
will
be
found
closely
to
assimilate
in
color
the
sand
upon
which
they
rest
on
a
neighboring
hill
you
will
find
few
if
any
of
this
species
of
locust
but
instead
there
occur
two
or
three
quite
different
species
which
when
at
rest
closely
resemble
the
rocks
this
resemblance
is
very
striking
and
is
found
in
all
stages
of
the
insect
existence
if
now
you
go
to
a
lowland
meadow
still
another
color
phase
will
be
found
to
prevail
the
green
grass
is
swarming
with
the
grasshoppers
which
are
green
throughout
with
linear
bodies
and
long
slender
legs
and
antennae
each
of
these
three
groups
of
insects
is
adapted
to
its
particular
habitat
all
are
constantly
persecuted
by
birds
and
have
been
so
persecuted
for
unnumbered
ages
in
the
past
in
every
generation
the
individuals
have
varied
some
toward
closer
resemblance
to
environment
others
in
an
opposite
direction
the
more
conspicuous
insects
have
been
constantly
taken
and
the
least
conspicuous
as
constantly
left
to
reproduce
were
the
three
groups
to
change
places
the
green
grasshoppers
from
the
meadows
going
to
sandy
surfaces
the
locusts
going
to
rocky
hills
and
the
mossbacks
from
the
hills
to
the
lowland
meadows
each
would
become
conspicuous
and
the
birds
would
have
such
a
feast
as
is
seldom
spread
before
them
the
species
living
on
sand
and
rocks
are
often
flushed
by
birds
those
which
flew
but
a
few
feet
would
be
likely
to
be
captured
by
the
pursuing
bird
those
which
flew
farther
would
stand
a
better
chance
of
escaping
similarly
those
which
flew
slowly
and
in
a
straight
line
would
be
more
likely
to
be
caught
than
those
which
flew
rapidly
and
took
a
zigzag
course
as
a
consequence
of
the
selection
thus
brought
about
through
the
elimination
of
those
which
flew
slowly
along
the
straight
and
narrow
way
that
led
to
death
you
will
find
that
most
locusts
living
in
exposed
situations
when
startled
fly
some
distance
in
a
rapid
zigzag
manner
but
still
another
element
of
safety
has
been
introduced
by
some
species
of
these
locusts
through
the
adoption
of
the
color
tactics
of
the
catocala
moths
the
under
wings
of
the
common
carolina
locust
the
species
most
abundant
along
the
highway
are
black
bordered
with
yellowish
white
the
base
of
the
hind
wings
of
a
related
species
living
on
the
western
plains
is
bluish
while
in
the
large
locust
of
the
eastern
states
the
hind
wings
are
red
bordered
with
black
in
nearly
all
of
the
species
of
these
locusts
frequenting
open
localities
where
they
are
liable
to
disturbance
by
birds
or
other
animals
the
hind
wings
exhibit
contrasting
colors
in
flight
most
of
them
also
fly
in
a
zigzag
line
and
alight
in
a
most
erratic
manner
many
times
i
have
had
difficulty
in
determining
the
exact
landfall
of
one
of
these
peculiar
creatures
and
i
believe
lord
walsingham
suggestion
is
well
exemplified
in
them
page
the
most
famous
example
of
a
combination
of
this
dazzling
coloring
of
the
upper
wing
surface
with
a
definite
protective
coloring
of
the
under
wing
surface
is
the
kallima
butterfly
which
is
illustrated
in
almost
every
book
dealing
with
animal
coloration
the
under
wing
surface
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
a
leaf
and
the
hind
wings
project
to
form
a
tail
which
looks
like
the
petiole
of
the
leaf
and
there
is
also
a
mark
running
across
the
wings
which
mimics
the
midrib
when
the
butterfly
is
flying
the
brilliant
colors
of
the
upper
surface
are
visible
but
when
it
alights
these
are
instantly
replaced
by
the
sombre
tone
of
the
under
surface
so
that
apparently
the
insect
completely
disappears
and
in
its
place
there
is
only
a
leaf
attached
to
a
branch
in
a
most
natural
position
in
longstaff
book
there
is
an
illustration
of
another
tropical
butterfly
which
resembles
on
its
under
surface
a
yellow
leaf
but
on
its
upper
surface
gives
a
brilliant
combination
of
black
and
white
this
insect
alights
upon
the
leaves
which
it
resembles
and
is
a
striking
example
of
both
dazzling
and
mimicking
coloration
many
of
our
own
butterflies
notably
the
are
excellent
examples
of
a
similar
combination
in
flight
they
reveal
conspicuous
colors
which
are
instantly
hidden
upon
alighting
and
then
one
only
sees
the
or
dead
under
surface
as
may
be
seen
in
the
plate
opposite
pages
the
iridescence
upon
the
upper
wing
surface
of
many
butterflies
whose
under
wing
surface
is
colored
in
concealing
tones
is
doubtless
also
of
great
use
to
the
insect
in
a
similar
way
there
is
a
splendid
opportunity
here
for
some
observer
to
study
this
phase
of
butterfly
activity
and
to
get
photographs
of
the
insects
amid
their
natural
surroundings
in
their
book
upon
concealing
coloration
the
thayer
have
called
attention
to
many
interesting
phases
of
dazzling
coloration
they
show
that
bright
marks
like
the
or
ocelli
which
form
so
prominent
a
feature
on
the
wing
surfaces
of
many
butterflies
really
helped
to
conceal
the
insect
amid
its
natural
surroundings
by
drawing
the
eye
away
from
the
outlines
of
wings
and
body
so
that
the
latter
tend
to
disappear
their
discussion
of
this
subject
opens
up
another
vast
field
for
outdoor
observations
of
absorbing
interest
in
which
there
is
great
need
for
many
active
workers

sense
one
who
collects
the
underwing
moths
soon
discovers
that
the
light
colored
species
which
resemble
the
bark
of
birch
trees
are
likely
to
be
found
upon
the
trunks
of
those
trees
and
that
the
dark

which
resemble

of

trees
are
likely
to
be
found
upon
the
trunks
of
these
obviously
were
this
not
true
the
protective
coloring
would
avail
but
little
and
it
is
evident
that
these
moths
are
able
to
select
a
background
which
is
of
advantage
in
helping
to
conceal
them
there
is
much
evidence
to
show
that
in
a
similar
way
the
butterflies
are
able
by
means
of
a
color
sense
to
select
the
places
where
they
alight
one
of
the
most
notable
examples
is
that
of
a
south
american
species
this
is
a
silvery
gray
butterfly
which
alights
head
downward
upon
the
bark
of
certain
palm
trees
that
have
silvery
gray
stems
and
remains
there
with
its
wings
fully
expanded
so
that
it
utilizes
the
background
in
much
the
same
way
that
the
underwing
moths
do
when
disturbed
they
will
return
to
the
same
tree
again
and
again
one
who
will
observe
the
habits
of
our
and
other
butterflies
which
have
obliterative
coloring
of
the
under
wing
surface
can
easily
learn
that
these
insects
select
rather
carefully
the
places
where
they
alight
it
will
be
found
that
as
a
rule
each
species
utilizes
a
background
that
blends
with
its
own
coloring
it
is
probable
that
this
habit
is
much
more
common
in
other
groups
of
butterflies
than
has
been
realized
much
evidence
of
this
sort
has
been
collected
regarding
the
butterflies
of
europe
and
other
countries
as
well
as
near
our
own
borders
in
america
warning
coloration
and
mimicry
the
colors
of
a
great
many
animals
including
a
considerable
percentage
of
american
butterflies
and
their
larvae
have
been
commonly
explained
by
the
theory
of
according
to
this
theory
animals
which
were
for
any
reason
not
edible
by
birds
and
mammals
have
developed
various
striking
combinations
of
color
such
as
black
and
yellow
red
and
black
or
black
and
white
in
order
to
advertise
to
their
foes
their
inedible
qualities
this
theory
has
been
very
generally
accepted
by
naturalists
and
will
be
found
expounded
at
length
in
many
books
published
during
the
last
quarter
century
the
whole
subject
of
the
validity
of
warning
coloration
has
recently
been
brought
up
for
reconsideration
by
the
illuminating
investigations
of
abbott
thayer
and
discussed
at
length
in
the
book
upon
concealing
coloration
already
mentioned
in
an
appendix
to
this
book
dated
thayer
states
that
he
no
longer
holds
the
belief
that
there
must
somewhere
be
warning
colors
he
has
convincingly
shown
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
animals
which
were
supposed
to
be
examples
of
this
theory
are
really
illustrations
of
concealing
coloration
but
there
yet
remain
various
facts
which
have
been
conclusively
proven
that
apparently
require
the
theory
of
warning
colors
to
explain
them
here
is
another
field
in
which
there
is
a
real
need
for
much
careful
investigation
under
conditions
that
are
rigidly
scientific
along
with
the
theory
of
warning
coloration
the
theory
of
has
been
propounded
according
to
this
if
a
butterfly
in
a
given
region
shows
warning
coloration
having
developed
such
coloration
because
it
is
distasteful
to
birds
and
mammals
it
may
be
mimicked
by
another
butterfly
in
the
same
region
belonging
to
another
group
the
latter
butterfly
being
edible
but
benefiting
by
its
resemblance
to
the
distasteful
species
because
birds
or
mammals
mistake
it
for
the
latter
and
do
not
attempt
to
catch
it
the
most
notable
example
of
such
mimicry
in
north
america
is
that
of
the
monarch
butterfly
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
distasteful
species
and
the
viceroy
butterfly
which
is
supposed
to
mimic
it
several
other
instances
of
mimicry
are
found
among
our
own
butterflies
while
in
south
america
africa
and
asia
there
are
numberless
examples
heliotropism
it
has
long
been
known
that
the
green
surfaces
of
plants
respond
to
the
stimulus
of
the
sun
rays
in
a
most
remarkable
manner
this
response
has
commonly
been
called
and
it
has
been
carefully
studied
by
botanists
all
over
the
habitable
world
more
recently
the
fact
has
been
observed
that
many
animals
respond
in
certain
definite
ways
to
the
stimulus
of
direct
sunshine
and
the
same
term
has
been
applied
in
this
case
very
little
attention
has
been
given
to
the
subject
of
heliotropism
until
within
a
few
recent
years
but
the
observations
which
have
been
made
by
parker
longstaff
dixey
and
others
open
up
a
most
interesting
field
for
further
observation
an
admirable
summary
of
our
present
knowledge
of
the
subject
has
been
published
by
longstaff
in
his
book
butterfly
hunting
in
many
lands
one
of
the
earliest
observations
upon
this
subject
was
that
published
in
my
book
nature
biographies
which
appeared
in
june
concerning
the
habit
in
the
mourning
cloak
on
a
day
early
in
november
the
i
came
across
one
of
these
butterflies
basking
in
the
sunshine
upon
the
ties
of
a
railway
track
it
rested
with
its
wings
wide
open
on
being
disturbed
it
would
fly
a
short
distance
and
then
alight
and
i
was
interested
to
notice
that
after
alighting
it
would
always
turn
about
until
the
hind
end
of
its
body
pointed
in
the
direction
of
the
sun
so
that
the
sun
rays
struck
its
wings
and
body
nearly
at
right
angles
i
repeatedly
observed
this
habit
of
getting
into
the
position
in
which
the
most
benefit
from
the
sunshine
was
received
and
it
is
of
interest
as
showing
the
extreme
delicacy
of
perception
toward
the
warmth
of
sunshine
which
these
creatures
possess
a
little
later
some
very
elaborate
observations
were
made
upon
this
habit
of
the
mourning
cloak
by
parker
of
harvard
university
professor
parker
noticed
that
during
the
warm
spells
in
winter
the
butterflies
came
out
of
their
hiding
places
and
after
alighting
always
placed
themselves
with
their
heads
away
from
the
direction
of
the
sun
and
their
bodies
lying
nearly
at
right
angles
to
the
sun
rays
by
experiment
he
found
that
they
adjusted
themselves
to
this
position
as
soon
as
they
were
fully
exposed
to
direct
sunshine
even
if
at
the
time
of
alighting
they
were
in
a
shadow
he
found
that
this
movement
was
a
reflex
action
through
the
eyes
for
when
the
eyes
were
blinded
no
such
adjustment
took
place
he
called
it
longstaff
uses
the
term
for
this
adjustment
of
the
butterfly
to
the
sun
rays
and
he
finds
it
is
a
very
general
habit
especially
with
the
for
the
butterfly
thus
to
orient
itself
after
alighting
in
such
a
way
that
the
hind
end
of
the
body
points
toward
the
sun
this
occurs
not
only
with
those
species
which
keep
their
wings
spread
open
when
they
alight
but
also
with
those
in
which
the
wings
are
closed
together
and
held
in
a
vertical
position
on
alighting
various
explanations
of
this
phenomenon
have
been
offered
but
apparently
none
of
them
are
yet
generally
accepted
were
the
habit
confined
to
butterflies
like
the
mourning
cloak
it
would
seem
easy
to
prove
that
a
main
advantage
was
found
in
the
benefit
derived
from
the
heat
rays
of
the
sun
were
it
confined
to
those
species
which
always
fold
their
wings
on
alighting
it
would
seem
easy
to
believe
that
it
was
a
device
for
reducing
the
shadow
cast
by
the
insect
to
its
lowest
terms
it
has
also
been
suggested
that
the
habit
is
for
the
purpose
of
revealing
to
the
fullest
extent
the
markings
of
the
butterfly
evidently
there
is
here
an
ample
field
for
further
investigation
before
definite
conclusions
are
reached
list
and
shadow
observations
another
field
for
most
interesting
studies
upon
the
habits
of
living
butterflies
has
been
opened
up
by
the
very
interesting
discussion
of
and
in
colonel
longstaff
fascinating
book
butterfly
hunting
in
many
lands
he
there
summarizes
his
numerous
observations
upon
butterflies
in
various
localities
which
he
has
seen
to
lean
over
at
a
decided
angle
when
they
alight
he
defines
as
an
attitude
resulting
from
the
rotation
of
the
insect
about
its
longitudinal
axis
as
heliotropism
results
from
a
rotation
about
an
imaginary
vertical
axis
at
right
angles
to
this
the
name
is
adapted
from
the
sailors
term
applied
to
a
vessel
leaning
to
one
side
or
another
in
a
storm
apparently
this
interesting
habit
was
first
called
to
the
attention
of
european
entomologists
by
an
observation
of
colonel
bingham
made
in
but
not
published
until
long
afterward
the
observation
was
this
the
was
there
among
dead
leaves
its
wings
folded
and
looking
for
all
the
world
a
dead
dry
leaf
itself
with
regard
to
melanitis
i
have
not
seen
it
recorded
anywhere
that
the
species
of
this
genus
when
disturbed
fly
a
little
way
drop
suddenly
into
the
undergrowth
with
closed
wings
and
invariably
lie
a
little
askew
and
slanting
which
still
more
increases
their
likeness
to
a
dead
leaf
casually
fallen
to
the
ground
long
before
this
was
printed
however
a
similar
habit
had
been
observed
by
scudder
in
the
case
of
our
white
mountain
butterfly
but
this
species
is
so
exceptional
in
its
habitat
that
the
habit
seems
to
have
been
considered
a
special
adaptation
to
the
mountain
top
the
possibility
of
its
being
at
all
general
among
the
butterflies
in
lowlands
seems
to
have
been
overlooked
the
observations
recorded
by
longstaff
relate
chiefly
to
various
members
of
the
satyrid
group
for
example
a
common
grayling
was
watched
many
times
as
it
settled
on
the
ground
as
a
rule
three
motions
are
gone
through
in
regular
sequence
the
wings
are
brought
together
over
the
back
the
forewings
are
drawn
between
the
hind
wings
the
whole
is
thrown
over
to
right
or
left
to
the
extent
of
thirty
forty
or
even
fifty
degrees
this
habit
of
course
is
of
advantage
to
the
insect
it
seems
possible
that
the
advantage
might
be
explained
in
either
of
two
ways
first
the
leaning
over
on
the
ground
among
grasses
and
fallen
leaves
might
help
to
render
the
disguising
coloration
of
the
insect
more
effective
the
large
ocelli
serving
to
draw
the
eye
away
from
the
outline
of
body
and
wing
second
the
listing
of
the
butterfly
toward
the
sun
tends
to
reduce
the
shadow
and
to
hide
it
beneath
the
wings
there
is
no
doubt
that
when
a
grayling
butterfly
lights
upon
the
ground
in
strong
sunshine
the
shadow
it
casts
is
more
conspicuous
than
the
insect
itself
and
the
hiding
of
this
might
be
of
distinct
advantage
in
helping
it
to
escape
observation
it
is
significant
that
in
england
the
butterflies
observed
appear
to
lean
over
more
frequently
in
sunshine
than
in
shade
an
observation
of
waddilove
reported
by
colonel
longstaff
is
interesting
in
this
connection
a
grayling
settled
on
a
patch
of
bare
black
peat
earth
shut
up
its
wings
vertically
and
crawled
at
once
some
two
yards
to
the
edge
of
the
patch
to
where
some
a
cone
or
two
and
a
few
brittle
twigs
were
lying
and
then
becoming
stationary
threw
itself
over
at
an
angle
of
some
degrees
square
to
the
sun
it
thus
became
quite
indistinguishable
from
its
surroundings
apparently
some
of
the
may
have
the
same
habit
for
in
barrett
lepidoptera
of
the
british
islands
there
is
a
note
in
regard
to
to
the
effect
that
it
is
fond
of
sunning
itself
in
roads
on
warm
walls
or
on
the
ground
upon
dead
leaves
in
sheltered
valleys
here
if
the
sun
becomes
overclouded
it
will
sometimes
close
its
wings
and
almost
lie
down
in
such
a
manner
that
to
distinguish
its
brown
and
green
marbled
under
side
from
the
dead
leaves
is
almost
impossible
here
is
a
most
fascinating
opportunity
for
american
observers
to
determine
definitely
the
facts
in
regard
to
our
numerous
species
of
butterflies
that
may
show
this
habit
an
observer
with
a
reflex
type
of
camera
might
easily
be
able
to
get
pictures
that
would
be
of
great
value
in
helping
to
determine
the
principal
facts
in
regard
to
the
subject
our
common
graylings
and
numerous
species
of
are
so
abundant
and
easily
observed
that
they
offer
splendid
opportunities
to
any
one
who
will
undertake
a
serious
study
of
the
subject
parasitic
enemies
all
three
of
the
earlier
stages
of
butterflies
egg
larva
and
chrysalis
are
subject
to
attack
by
various
parasitic
insects
which
develop
at
the
expense
of
the
host
such
parasites
are
probably
the
most
important
check
upon
the
increase
of
butterflies
and
along
with
birds
mammals
and
bacterial
diseases
they
help
to
keep
up
that
balance
of
nature
which
in
the
long
run
maintains
a
surprising
uniformity
in
the
numbers
of
each
kind
of
butterfly
for
the
most
part
these
insect
parasites
are
small
flies
although
many
of
them
are
flies
in
either
case
the
life
stages
show
a
series
of
changes
much
like
those
of
the
butterflies
themselves
each
parasite
exists
first
as
an
egg
second
as
a
larva
third
as
a
pupa
and
fourth
as
an
adult
fly
the
larval
stage
however
is
simply
that
of
a
footless
grub
which
lives
within
the
body
of
its
victim
absorbing
its
life
blood
and
gradually
killing
it
the
parasites
of
butterfly
eggs
are
legion
they
are
tiny
flies
whose
in
briefest
summary
is
this
the
butterfly
lays
an
egg
the
parasite
fly
finds
this
egg
soon
after
it
is
laid
and
pierces
the
shell
with
her
tiny
sharply
pointed
ovipositor
and
deposits
inside
of
the
shell
her
own
microscopic
egg
this
egg
within
the
egg
soon
hatches
into
a
curious
little
larva
that
develops
at
the
expense
of
the
contents
of
the
butterfly
egg
shell
and
soon
absorbs
the
whole
of
them
the
parasite
larva
now
changes
to
a
pupa
which
a
little
later
changes
again
to
an
adult
fly
like
the
one
that
laid
the
parasite
egg
in
the
beginning
of
course
the
butterfly
egg
never
hatches
into
a
caterpillar
one
of
the
most
interesting
questions
in
regard
to
these
egg
parasites
is
this
how
does
the
tiny
parasitic
fly
find
the
newly
laid
egg
one
would
think
that
the
proverbial
search
for
a
needle
in
a
haymow
would
be
an
easy
task
compared
with
that
of
a
fly
about
as
large
as
the
head
of
a
pin
finding
a
butterfly
egg
of
similar
size
upon
some
part
of
one
of
the
millions
of
leaves
upon
the
trees
and
shrubs
in
field
and
forest
yet
the
search
is
successful
as
every
one
who
has
tried
to
get
caterpillars
from
eggs
found
out
of
doors
will
testify
on
a
later
page
in
this
book
in
connection
with
the
story
of
the
life
of
the
mourning
cloak
butterfly
i
have
recorded
some
observations
upon
the
little
parasite
which
seemed
to
have
been
riding
around
upon
the
body
of
the
butterfly
waiting
for
her
to
lay
her
eggs
for
one
parasite
upon
the
eggs
of
butterflies
there
probably
are
dozens
that
attack
the
caterpillars
a
large
proportion
of
the
butterfly
larvae
brought
in
from
outdoors
especially
those
which
are
or
more
will
yield
not
butterflies
but
parasites
this
is
the
experience
of
practically
every
one
who
attempts
to
rear
these
insects
and
it
emphasizes
the
value
of
the
advice
that
in
order
to
get
fine
specimens
it
is
desirable
to
rear
them
from
eggs
laid
by
butterflies
beneath
netting
or
in
cages
the
of
the
parasites
that
attack
caterpillars
vary
greatly
the
simplest
are
those
of
the
large
ichneumon
flies
the
mother
fly
lays
an
egg
beneath
the
skin
of
the
caterpillar
the
egg
hatches
into
a
larva
that
absorbs
the
fatty
parts
of
the
body
of
the
caterpillar
gradually
growing
larger
and
larger
until
at
last
it
reaches
a
length
of
possibly
an
inch
by
this
time
it
is
likely
to
have
absorbed
so
large
a
part
of
the
inside
of
the
caterpillar
that
the
latter
dies
the
parasite
larva
now
changes
to
a
pupa
either
inside
or
outside
the
skin
of
the
caterpillar
and
a
little
later
changes
again
to
an
adult
ichneumon
fly
illustration
tachinid
parasite
fly
puparium
magnified
in
the
case
just
given
one
egg
only
was
deposited
within
the
skin
of
the
caterpillar
in
many
others
however
a
large
number
of
eggs
may
be
so
deposited
by
a
single
fly
a
special
group
of
ichneumon
flies
called
the
microgasters
contains
many
parasites
that
have
this
peculiarity
the
microgaster
larvae
on
coming
forth
from
the
caterpillar
have
the
habit
of
spinning
tiny
cocoons
within
which
they
change
to
pupae
by
collecting
some
cabbage
worms
which
are
nearly
full
grown
and
keeping
them
in
a
glass
jar
one
can
generally
get
a
considerable
number
of
these
microgaster
cocoons
and
rear
the
flies
from
them
another
group
of
caterpillar
parasites
is
still
more
minute
they
are
called
the
chalcid
flies
their
are
full
of
interest
and
might
easily
furnish
opportunity
for
a
long
lifetime
of
study
and
experiment
one
is
likely
to
get
hundreds
of
these
chalcid
flies
from
a
single
caterpillar
another
interesting
group
of
parasites
is
that
of
the
tachina
flies
cut
on
this
the
of
some
of
these
is
comparatively
simple
a
buzzing
fly
looking
much
like
a
large
housefly
lays
a
small
whitish
egg
upon
the
skin
of
a
caterpillar
this
egg
is
glued
tightly
and
is
large
enough
to
be
readily
seen
by
the
unaided
eye
it
hatches
into
a
tiny
larva
that
eats
its
way
through
the
part
of
the
shell
glued
to
the
skin
and
through
the
latter
at
the
same
time
so
the
newly
hatched
tachina
larva
finds
itself
in
the
body
of
its
caterpillar
host
it
lives
there
absorbing
the
fatty
juices
around
it
until
at
last
it
either
kills
or
stupefies
its
unfortunate
victim
it
has
then
become
full
grown
as
a
larva
and
its
last
larval
skin
hardens
into
a
brown
within
which
the
little
creature
changes
into
a
pupa
it
may
or
may
not
have
burrowed
through
the
skin
of
the
caterpillar
before
this
happened
a
little
later
the
pupa
changes
to
a
tachina
fly
which
breaks
apart
the
and
flies
out
into
the
world
it
has
lately
been
found
however
that
many
tachinids
have
much
more
complicated
than
this
i
have
already
discussed
some
of
the
more
important
of
these
in
my
book
entitled
seeing
nature
first
one
can
frequently
rear
parasites
from
the
chrysalids
of
butterflies
but
in
many
cases
it
is
probable
that
these
began
their
parasitic
development
in
the
caterpillars
which
were
able
to
change
to
chrysalids
before
being
killed
in
some
cases
however
the
chrysalids
seem
to
be
attacked
especially
by
certain
ichneumon
flies
rearing
butterflies
from
caterpillars
there
are
few
things
in
the
world
more
interesting
to
watch
than
the
wonderful
changes
which
a
moth
or
butterfly
goes
through
in
the
course
of
its
life
you
find
on
a
tree
or
shrub
a
caterpillar
you
take
it
in
charge
placing
it
in
a
box
or
jar
where
you
can
provide
leaves
for
its
food
and
soon
it
either
spins
around
itself
a
silken
shroud
thus
hiding
from
your
sight
or
else
it
simply
seems
to
change
to
a
lifeless
object
without
eyes
or
wings
or
legs
unable
to
move
about
and
motionless
save
for
a
slight
wriggle
when
you
touch
it
yet
if
you
keep
the
shroud
or
the
object
for
two
or
three
weeks
you
are
likely
to
see
a
beautiful
moth
come
from
the
shroud
or
a
glorious
butterfly
break
out
of
the
mummy
case
plate
page
so
you
can
get
the
realest
kind
of
moving
pictures
by
simply
bringing
in
the
caterpillars
that
are
easily
found
in
garden
field
and
wood
to
collect
these
caterpillars
it
is
only
necessary
to
be
provided
with
a
pair
of
sharp
eyes
and
an
empty
coffee
can
or
some
other
form
of
tin
box
go
out
into
the
garden
or
along
the
borders
of
the
woods
look
carefully
if
you
see
places
where
leaves
have
been
eaten
search
the
leaves
near
by
and
you
are
likely
to
find
one
or
more
of
the
caterpillars
that
caused
the
injury
transfer
them
to
the
box
and
take
them
home
with
a
few
leaves
of
the
food
plant
there
place
them
in
some
form
of
vivarium
which
simply
means
a
box
or
cage
in
which
you
can
keep
living
creatures
the
most
satisfactory
cages
for
rearing
caterpillars
are
those
which
are
open
above
so
that
there
is
not
even
a
glass
plate
between
the
observer
and
the
insect
this
kind
of
vivarium
is
easily
made
by
using
a
band
of
some
sticky
substance
like
the
tree
tanglefoot
with
which
trees
are
commonly
banded
or
a
strip
of
sticky
fly
paper
any
wide
shallow
box
may
be
used
by
simply
placing
an
band
of
the
sticky
material
around
the
vertical
sides
near
the
top
the
caterpillars
will
be
free
to
move
all
over
the
open
box
but
they
can
not
cross
the
band
to
escape
fresh
leaves
are
easily
placed
in
the
open
box
and
the
withered
ones
removed
the
same
plan
may
be
adopted
with
wide
glass
jars
like
the
ordinary
battery
jar
choose
a
rather
large
one
and
smear
the
inner
side
near
the
top
with
a
band
of
sticky
material
the
caterpillars
are
thus
prevented
from
crawling
out
but
they
are
open
to
observation
at
all
times
plate
pages
in
the
case
of
the
caterpillars
that
change
to
butterflies
no
soil
need
be
placed
in
the
bottom
of
the
jar
as
these
will
attach
their
chrysalids
to
the
sides
or
to
a
stick
or
board
which
may
easily
be
put
in
in
the
case
of
many
caterpillars
that
change
to
moths
however
it
is
desirable
to
place
about
two
inches
of
soil
in
the
bottom
of
the
jar
then
if
the
caterpillars
are
not
cocoon
spinners
they
can
burrow
into
the
soil
when
they
are
ready
to
change
to
pupae
instead
of
applying
the
sticky
material
directly
to
the
glass
a
strip
of
sticky
fly
paper
may
be
glued
to
it
as
a
rule
the
butterfly
caterpillar
easiest
to
find
lives
upon
cabbages
go
into
the
garden
and
you
are
likely
to
see
a
dozen
green
caterpillars
upon
as
many
cabbage
plants
bring
in
several
of
the
larger
ones
and
place
them
in
a
vivarium
with
some
fresh
cabbage
leaves
in
a
few
days
some
of
them
will
be
likely
to
fasten
themselves
to
the
vertical
sides
of
the
vivarium
and
shed
the
caterpillar
skin
each
thus
becomes
a
chrysalis
about
ten
days
later
this
chrysalis
skin
will
break
open
and
a
white
cabbage
butterfly
will
come
out
so
your
caterpillar
goes
through
the
four
different
stages
of
insect
life
it
was
first
an
egg
laid
upon
the
leaf
by
a
butterfly
the
egg
hatched
into
the
caterpillar
or
larva
the
larva
changed
to
the
chrysalis
the
chrysalis
changed
to
the
butterfly
or
adult
insect
one
of
the
most
satisfactory
ways
to
rear
the
caterpillars
of
butterflies
is
to
get
the
females
to
lay
their
eggs
upon
the
food
plant
in
the
case
of
many
species
this
is
not
difficult
the
simplest
way
is
to
enclose
the
mother
butterfly
in
a
small
gauze
bag
tied
over
the
branch
of
the
food
plant
if
she
has
eggs
ready
to
deposit
she
is
very
likely
to
lay
them
under
these
conditions
after
they
are
laid
the
mother
butterfly
may
be
allowed
to
escape
but
it
is
well
to
replace
the
gauze
protection
as
a
safeguard
against
many
sorts
of
enemies
which
may
destroy
the
eggs
or
the
young
caterpillars
that
hatch
from
them
another
way
is
to
enclose
the
butterflies
with
a
twig
of
the
food
plant
in
a
glass
jar
sealing
it
tight
to
prevent
the
leaves
from
wilting
the
butterfly
is
likely
after
she
has
quieted
down
to
lay
her
eggs
upon
the
leaves
according
to
william
wright
who
speaks
from
his
long
experience
with
the
butterflies
of
the
west
coast
these
genera
will
lay
their
eggs
on
anything
parnassius
argynnis
euptoieta
neonympha
and
all
members
of
the
family
satyridae
in
these
cases
one
can
get
the
eggs
by
simply
enclosing
the
butterflies
in
glass
jars
or
gauze
nets
without
even
the
leaves
of
the
food
plant
william
edwards
found
in
his
long
experience
that
one
can
get
the
eggs
of
practically
all
butterflies
in
confinement
provided
only
the
insects
are
sufficiently
mature
so
that
the
eggs
are
ready
to
be
laid
he
found
that
the
cause
of
failure
to
get
eggs
from
many
of
the
fritillaries
early
in
the
season
was
that
the
eggs
were
not
mature
and
that
from
the
same
kinds
of
butterflies
with
which
he
failed
early
in
the
summer
he
got
plenty
of
eggs
in
september
there
is
here
a
rich
field
for
observation
and
experiment
for
every
naturalist
who
wishes
to
take
up
the
study
of
butterflies
he
can
be
sure
of
the
parentage
of
the
caterpillars
and
can
trace
them
from
the
very
moment
of
through
all
their
wonderful
changes
until
they
become
butterflies
again
photographing
butterflies
there
is
a
famous
old
saying
that
to
make
hare
stew
it
is
first
necessary
to
catch
your
hare
so
if
one
wishes
to
make
perfect
pictures
of
butterflies
it
is
first
necessary
to
get
the
caterpillars
for
though
caterpillars
are
not
butterflies
they
are
butterflies
in
the
making
and
they
will
show
you
most
interesting
stages
in
manufacture
of
these
dainty
and
exquisite
creatures
this
is
not
however
the
chief
reason
why
the
photographer
should
get
them
he
will
wish
to
make
perfect
pictures
and
in
order
to
do
this
he
must
have
not
only
perfect
specimens
but
living
butterflies
which
are
willing
to
look
pleasant
while
he
makes
comparatively
long
exposures
under
conditions
of
light
that
he
can
control
if
you
catch
a
butterfly
outdoors
and
bring
it
in
you
will
be
likely
to
find
that
it
is
by
no
means
a
docile
subject
the
sunlight
shining
through
the
nearest
window
will
be
a
call
which
you
can
not
counteract
and
your
butterfly
will
constantly
respond
to
it
in
a
most
vexing
manner
so
you
must
catch
the
butterfly
young
and
take
advantage
of
a
brief
but
docile
period
in
their
lives
when
they
are
willing
to
pose
before
your
camera
in
quite
a
remarkable
manner
this
is
the
period
just
after
the
butterfly
emerges
from
the
chrysalis
when
its
wings
are
fully
developed
but
before
the
tissues
have
hardened
and
the
muscles
in
the
thorax
are
strong
enough
for
flight
at
this
time
the
butterfly
is
perfect
every
scale
is
in
its
place
and
every
spot
of
color
is
at
its
best
and
it
will
rest
quietly
upon
a
flower
leaf
or
twig
while
you
adjust
the
camera
and
expose
the
plate
from
one
such
specimen
one
can
get
many
pictures
upon
different
flowers
and
with
different
angles
of
view
plates
pages
in
order
to
make
admirable
photographs
of
living
butterflies
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
to
have
a
regular
photographic
studio
if
one
has
a
room
lighted
from
the
north
or
east
one
can
arrange
for
exposure
near
the
window
using
cardboard
reflectors
to
make
the
light
more
even
from
both
sides
in
such
a
situation
one
soon
learns
the
exposure
periods
required
and
can
easily
get
many
beautiful
photographs
a
collection
of
prints
of
the
butterflies
of
one
locality
would
be
one
of
the
most
interesting
photographic
exhibits
that
an
amateur
could
select
it
is
comparatively
easy
to
get
rather
full
sets
showing
the
of
several
of
our
larger
species
and
such
sets
are
of
course
of
especial
interest
in
the
case
of
those
caterpillars
which
make
nests
upon
the
food
plant
like
the
painted
beauty
larva
which
remains
for
weeks
feeding
upon
the
leaves
of
the
common
wild
everlasting
the
taking
of
the
pictures
of
the
different
stages
is
comparatively
easy
one
can
keep
the
plant
with
the
stem
in
water
and
get
the
caterpillar
to
change
to
the
chrysalis
and
emerge
as
the
butterfly
in
the
nest
made
from
the
flower
heads
and
the
upper
leaves

butterfly
collections
there
are
few
groups
in
nature
which
offer
such
advantages
to
the
collector
as
that
of
the
butterflies
they
are
easily
obtained
easily
preserved
and
retain
their
beauty
for
a
long
period
even
under
exposure
to
strong
light
they
offer
opportunities
for
serious
study
in
which
one
can
not
only
review
the
facts
which
others
have
already
discovered
but
also
hope
to
contribute
something
of
value
to
the
sum
of
human
knowledge
the
mistake
most
commonly
made
by
beginners
with
butterflies
as
with
other
collections
is
to
undertake
too
much
instead
of
starting
on
the
hopeless
task
of
making
a
collection
of
the
butterflies
of
the
world
it
is
much
better
to
start
with
the
intention
of
making
a
collection
of
those
of
one
own
town
in
the
latter
case
one
can
hope
soon
to
attain
the
desired
end
and
then
if
one
wishes
it
is
a
simple
matter
to
reach
out
and
make
a
collection
of
the
butterflies
of
the
state
or
even
of
the
particular
region
in
which
the
state
is
located
the
natural
limitations
for
a
collection
in
new
england
is
to
make
a
collection
of
new
england
butterflies
there
is
a
splendid
example
of
such
a
collection
on
exhibition
in
the
museum
of
the
boston
society
of
natural
history
this
contains
representatives
of
practically
every
kind
that
has
been
collected
in
new
england
and
yet
there
are
less
than
a
hundred
species
in
all
so
it
is
apparent
that
a
local
collection
should
be
attainable
by
any
enthusiastic
student
and
the
very
fact
that
the
number
of
species
is
limited
adds
interest
and
satisfaction
to
the
pursuit
the
main
value
of
any
collection
of
objects
lies
in
the
point
of
view
of
the
collector
the
most
natural
point
of
view
for
a
beginner
is
that
of
the
local
fauna
as
indicated
in
the
previous
paragraph
such
a
collection
best
serves
as
a
basis
for
a
study
of
the
subject
but
it
may
well
lead
to
a
broader
field
through
some
special
phase
of
scientific
interest
thus
while
it
would
be
hopeless
for
most
persons
to
attempt
a
collection
of
the
butterflies
of
the
world
it
would
be
entirely
reasonable
for
one
to
start
a
collection
of
all
the
species
in
the
world
of
any
given
genus
or
tribe
and
such
a
set
of
specimens
would
soon
come
to
possess
decided
scientific
value
or
instead
of
the
point
of
view
of
generic
or
family
relationship
one
could
take
the
point
of
view
of
special
geographical
distribution
thus
a
collection
of
all
the
butterflies
found
within
a
certain
number
of
degrees
of
the
north
pole
showing
the
circumpolar
butterfly
fauna
would
have
great
scientific
interest
there
are
also
various
other
points
of
view
which
could
be
followed
in
making
a
collection
there
are
already
in
many
of
the
museums
of
the
world
collections
of
butterflies
which
illustrate
the
various
phases
of
true
mimicry
the
resemblance
of
one
species
to
another
in
the
same
region
this
is
a
field
in
which
one
could
spend
a
lifetime
of
endeavor
and
secure
results
of
great
value
to
the
world
of
science
an
easier
problem
for
most
collectors
in
the
united
states
would
be
a
collection
made
from
the
point
of
view
of
resemblance
to
environment
including
such
examples
as
the
that
show
a
set
of
marks
on
the
under
surface
yet
another
point
of
view
would
be
that
of
hibernation
the
making
of
a
collection
of
all
butterflies
that
hibernate
as
adults
these
are
only
a
few
suggestions
there
are
many
other
phases
of
butterfly
life
which
could
be
utilized
as
the
basis
for
interesting
collections
the
important
thing
is
to
have
a
definite
object
in
view
and
to
make
the
collection
a
basis
for
a
real
study
of
the
subject
so
that
the
collector
will
not
only
be
growing
intellectually
but
will
also
be
making
a
real
contribution
to
our
scientific
knowledge
to
collect
and
preserve
butterflies
in
proper
condition
for
study
certain
apparatus
is
necessary
perhaps
the
first
essential
is
the
collecting
net
for
catching
butterflies
in
the
field
the
simplest
way
to
obtain
this
is
to
buy
it
of
the
dealers
in
entomological
supplies
nets
in
considerable
variety
and
at
various
prices
are
offered
in
the
catalogues
of
these
firms
one
can
make
however
a
net
at
home
with
little
difficulty
one
need
only
obtain
an
iron
wire
about
one
fifth
of
an
inch
in
diameter
and
bend
it
into
a
circular
ring
a
foot
or
fifteen
inches
wide
leaving
the
ends
projecting
at
right
angles
to
the
circle
and
having
a
blacksmith
weld
them
together
so
as
to
form
a
spur
about
four
inches
long
now
thrust
this
spur
into
some
convenient
handle
such
as
a
broomstick
and
sew
over
the
wire
circle
a
bag
of
mosquito
netting
swiss
muslin
or
some
similar
fabric
it
is
better
that
this
material
be
green
or
black
rather
than
white
after
the
butterflies
are
caught
they
must
be
killed
so
some
form
of
killing
bottle
is
necessary
most
collectors
use
a
cyanide
bottle
in
which
the
fumes
of
cyanide
of
potassium
kill
the
insects
one
of
the
best
ways
to
make
this
is
to
place
in
a
bottle
two
or
three
lumps
of
cyanide
of
potassium
approximately
an
inch
across
over
this
place
some
fine
sawdust
and
on
top
of
the
sawdust
pour
liquid
plaster
of
paris
carefully
so
that
it
will
harden
into
a
layer
about
half
an
inch
thick
allow
the
plaster
to
become
thoroughly
dry
then
insert
the
stopper
into
the
bottle
and
it
will
be
ready
for
use
it
is
better
to
use
a
ground
glass
stopper
so
that
the
bottle
will
always
be
air
tight
the
sawdust
is
often
omitted
the
plaster
of
paris
being
poured
directly
over
the
cyanide
the
special
advantage
of
the
sawdust
is
that
it
tends
to
absorb
the
cyanide
in
case
it
liquefies
as
it
often
does
in
damp
weather
as
this
cyanide
is
a
deadly
poison
it
is
better
to
let
a
druggist
prepare
the
bottle
or
else
to
buy
it
already
prepared
of
the
dealers
in
such
supplies

after
the
specimens
have
been
killed
in

cyanide
bottle
some
method
of
keeping
them
is
necessary
the
simplest
way
is
to
preserve
them
with
their
wings
closed
together
in
pieces
of
paper
folded
over
into
triangles
as
indicated
on
the
accompanying
diagrams
such
specimens
may
be
kept
for
an
indefinite
time
and
if
one
wishes
to
mount
them
later
it
is
only
necessary
to
place
them
for
a
few
hours
in
a
relaxing
jar
which
is
simply
a
closed
vessel
with
enough
water
in
the
bottom
to
saturate
the
air
with
moisture
a
great
advantage
of
keeping
the
specimens
in
these
paper
covers
is
that
they
require
so
little
room
and
are
easily
stored
away
in
tin

boxes

they
are
safe

superfamily
the
great
suborder
of
butterflies
is
commonly
separated
into
two
principal
groups
called
superfamilies
one
of
these
includes
all
of
the
higher
butterflies
and
is
named
the
other
includes
the
lower
skipper
butterflies
and
is

the
the
former

characterized
by
small
bodies
and
relatively
large
wings
straight
clubbed
antennae
and
the
fact
that
the
caterpillars
do
not
make
cocoons
when
preparing
for
the

state
the
most
authoritative
classifications
of
butterfly
families
are
based
upon
the
peculiarities
of
wing
venation
and
are
admirably
discussed
in
such
books
as
holland
butterfly
book
and
comstock
how
to
know
the
butterflies
without
attempting
to
go
into
the
technical
details
of
structure
it
will
suffice
here
to
give
the
list
of
families
which
compose
the
superfamily
the
parnassians
the
swallowtails
the
whites
and
yellows
the
nymphs
the
satyrs
or
the
heliconians
the
milkweed
butterflies
the
the
the
it
must
not
be
thought
that
such
a
list
necessarily
indicates
the
degrees
of
development
of
the
respective
families
for
this
is
not
true
it
is
simply
a
linear
arrangement
adopted
for
convenience
by
leading
authorities
notably
harrison
dyar
in
his
standard
catalog
of
american
lepidoptera
the
parnassian
butterflies
family
it
is
perhaps
a
bit
unfortunate
that
the
group
of
butterflies
which
is
commonly
chosen
to
head
the
list
of
families
is
one
that
is
rarely
seen
by
most
collectors
the
parnassians
are
butterflies
of
the
far
north
or
of
high
elevations
in
the
mountains
the
four
species
credited
to
north
america
have
been
collected
in
alaska
and
the
higher
elevations
of
the
rocky
mountains
so
there
is
very
little
probability
of
any
of
them
being
found
in
the
eastern
states
while
structurally
these
butterflies
have
a
close
affinity
with
the
swallowtails
one
would
never
suspect
it
from
their
general
appearance
their
bodies
are
large
and
all
of
the
wings
well
rounded
so
that
there
is
more
of
the
suggestion
of
a
large
moth
than
of
the
swallowtail
the
coloring
is
also
more
than
with
most
butterflies
the
wings
being
very
light
colored
and
nearly
transparent
with
markings
of
gray
and
brown
arranged
in
dots
and
splashes
all
our
species
belong
to
the
genus
parnassius
the
caterpillars
show
their
affinity
with
those
of
the
swallowtails
by
having
the
curious
scent
organs
or
osmateria
just
back
of
the
head
they
feed
upon
such
alpine
plants
as
stonecrop
and
saxifrage
and
are
well
adapted
by
their
structure
and
habits
to
the
bleak
surroundings
of
the
mountain
tops
as
a
typical
example
of
the
environment
in
which
these
butterflies
live
we
may
take
the
alpine
valleys
of
such
mountain
regions
as
pike

elrod

described
a
visit
where
at
an
altitude
of
feet
in
the
month
of
august
was
flying
by
thousands
and
the
earlier
stages
were
so
abundant
that
a
water
ditch
had
the
surface
covered
as
far
as
one
could
see
with
the
dead
or
dying
caterpillars
in
such
situations
where
ice
forms
at
night
and
snow
frequently
falls
by
day
these
butterflies
develop
apparently
in
greater
numbers
than
almost
any
of
our
other
species
are
known
to
do
in
warmer
regions
the
swallowtails
family
this
is
probably
the
most
distinctive
family
of
all
our
familiar
butterflies
its
members
are
characterized
by
being
on
the
whole
the
largest
butterflies
in
our
region
and
by
having
the
hind
wings
prolonged
into
curious
projections
suggestive
of
those
of
a
swallow
in
general
the
basal
color
of
the
wings
is
blackish
though
this
is
commonly
marked
in
various
striking
ways
with
yellow
green
or
blue
while
the
margins
of
the
wings
are
commonly
adorned
with
red
or
orange
spots
these
butterflies
are
also
characterized
by
certain
peculiarities
in
the
branching
of
the
wing
veins
which
will
be
found
pictured
in
more
technical
works
the
caterpillars
of
these
butterflies
have
the
characteristic
form
pictured
on
the
plate
of
the
swallowtails
opposite
page
when
full
grown
they
are
large
fairly
worms
showing
at
most
on
the
surface
sparse
fine
hairs
or
fleshy
threadlike
projections
their
most
characteristic
feature
is
found
in
the
scent
organs
called
situated
in
the
back
just
behind
the
head
these
are
thrust
out
generally
when
the
caterpillar
is
disturbed
and
appear
as
orange
or
organs
from
which
an
offensive
odor
is
commonly
given
off
they
are
supposed
to
serve
the
purpose
of
preventing
injury
by
enemies
possibly
birds
monkeys
and
other
vertebrates
structurally
they
are
like
long
tubular
pockets
that
can
be
turned
inside
out
when
the
pocket
is
in
place
it
is
getting
a
pocketful
of
odors
when
it
is
inverted
it
lets
these
odors
free
on
this
account
professor
comstock
has
aptly
called
these
caterpillars
the
polecats
of
the
insect
world
when
ready
to
pupate
these
papilio
caterpillars
spin
a
web
of
silk
upon
some
more
or
less
flattened
surface
and
a
loop
of
silk
near
by
they
entangle
their
hind
legs
in
the
former
and
keep
their
heads
through
the
latter
so
the
loop
supports
the
body
a
little
behind
the
head
then
they
change
to
chrysalids
which
are
held
in
place
by
these
sets
of
silken
threads
the
chrysalids
are
rather
large
and
angular
and
generally
take
on
colors
approximating
their
surroundings
they
vary
so
much
in
different
species
that
one
familiar
with
them
can
recognize
the
chrysalis
and
know
the
kind
of
butterfly
it
will
produce
black
while
the
black
swallowtail
is
not
so
large
as
some
other
members
of
the
group
it
is
probably
the
best
known
to
most
people
it
is
found
throughout
many
months
of
the
year
in
practically
all
parts
of
north
america
south
of
canada
and
has
the
habit
of
flying
freely
about
fields
and
gardens
in
search
of
flowers
from
which
to
suck
its
nectar
food
and
of
plants
on
which
to
deposit
its
eggs
the
female
butterflies
have
a
remarkable
ability
in
selecting
only
members
of
the
great
family
umbelliferae
for
this
purpose
in
consequence
the
caterpillars
are
generally
to
be
found
feeding
upon
carrots
parsnips
parsley
and
various
wild
species
belonging
to
this
order
plates
pages
and
the
eggs
of
the
black
swallowtail
are
laid
one
in
a
place
upon
the
leaves
of
the
food
plant
each
egg
is
a
small
yellowish
smooth
and
ovoid
object
it
may
often
be
found
by
watching
the
butterflies
as
they
fly
low
in
search
of
umbelliferous
plants
and
seeing
one
stop
for
a
minute
or
so
while
she
lays
the
egg
about
ten
days
after
the
egg
is
laid
it
hatches
into
a
small
black
caterpillar
marked
in
a
characteristic
fashion
with
a
blotch
of
white
in
the
middle
of
the
body
which
is
suggestive
of
a
saddle
the
caterpillar
immediately
begins
to
feed
upon
the
green
substance
of
the
leaf
continuing
thus
about
a
week
before
the
first
moult
at
this
time
it
does
not
change
much
in
appearance
still
being
a
spiny
creature
blackish
in
color
and
marked
by
the
curious
white
saddle
a
little
later
it
moults
again
retaining
its
original
coloring
at
each
moult
of
course
it
gets
larger
and
feeds
more
freely
upon
the
celery
or
other
plant
on
which
it
may
happen
to
be
when
the
caterpillar
becomes
about
half
grown
it
takes
on
a
very
different
appearance
from
that
of
its
early
life
the
skin
is
smooth
rather
than
spiny
and
the
general
colors
are
green
black
and
yellow
the
ground
color
of
the
skin
is
green
which
is
marked
with
black
along
the
middle
of
each
body
ring
on
these
bands
there
are
many
large
dots
of
orange
yellow
the
whole
coloring
giving
the
insect
a
very
striking
appearance
especially
when
it
is
placed
by
itself
against
a
plain
background
when
they
finally
become
full
grown
in
this
larva
state
these
caterpillars
are
almost
two
inches
long
the
larvae
of
the
black
swallowtail
have
certain
characteristics
in
which
they
differ
from
many
other
caterpillars
after
each
moult
they
do
not
devour
their
cast
skins
which
happens
in
the
case
of
many
of
their
relatives
when
feeding
as
well
as
when
resting
they
remain
exposed
upon
the
leaf
and
seem
never
to
attempt
to
conceal
themselves
as
is
the
habit
with
a
large
proportion
of
caterpillars
it
is
probable
that
this
instinct
for
remaining
exposed
to
view
bears
some
relation
to
the
curious
means
of
protection
possessed
by
this
as
well
as
other
swallowtail
caterpillars
when
disturbed
one
of
these
larvae
will
push
out
from
just
back
of
the
head
the
organ
which
gives
off
a
very
disagreeable
odor
these
osmateria
organs
are
generally
believed
to
be
defensive
against
the
attack
of
birds
and
various
other
enemies
although
they
seem
not
to
be
effective
against
insect
parasites
the
caterpillars
are
likely
to
leave
their
food
plants
when
ready
to
change
to
the
chrysalis
state
they
wander
in
various
directions
until
suitable
shelter
is
found
a
piece
of
board
a
fence
post
or
possibly
the
bark
of
a
tree
will
answer
for
this
purpose
here
the
caterpillar
spins
a
mat
of
silk
in
which
to
entangle
its
hind
legs
and
a
short
distance
away
near
the
front
end
of
the
body
it
spins
a
loop
of
silk
attaching
the
ends
to
the
support
these
serve
to
hold
the
chrysalis
in
place
during
this
helpless
period
after
the
loop
is
made
the
caterpillar
keeps
its
head
through
it
so
that
the
loop
holds
the
insect
in
position
a
short
distance
back
of
the
head
it
is
now
ready
to
moult
its
last
caterpillar
skin
and
become
a
chrysalis
one
who
has
watched
hundreds
of
these
caterpillars
go
through
this
change
miss
mary
dickerson
describes
the
process
in
these
words
in
this
final
moult
the
chrysalis
has
to
work
very
hard
the
bulk
of
the
body
is
again
slipped
forward
in
the
loosened
caterpillar
skin
so
that
this
becomes
tensely
stretched
over
the
anterior
end
and
very
much
wrinkled
at
the
posterior
end
the
skin
splits
back
of
the
head
and
is
forced
back
by
its
own
taut
condition
and
by
the
efforts
of
the
chrysalis
until
only
the
extreme
posterior
end
of
the
chrysalis
is
within
it
then
the
chrysalis
withdraws
this
posterior
end
with
its
many
very
tiny
hooks
from
the
skin
on
the
dorsal
side
and
reaching
around
securely
fastens
the
hooks
into
the
button
of
silk
then
the
old
skin
is
removed
both
from
its
fastening
to
the
chrysalis
and
from
its
attachment
in
the
button
of
silk
a
short
time
after
the
caterpillar
skin
has
thus
been
cast
off
the
chrysalis
takes
on
a
brownish
color
which
as
is
so
often
the
case
is
likely
to
vary
somewhat
according
to
the
tint
of
the
surrounding
surfaces
this
is
doubtless
a
protective
device
and
helps
the
insect
to
escape
attack
by
birds
during
the
long
period
of
exposure
for
this
butterfly
passes
through
the
winter
only
in
the
chrysalis
condition
and
the
larva
which
went
into
the
chrysalis
in
september
does
not
come
out
as
a
butterfly
until
the
following
may
or
june
there
are
however
two
broods
of
the
butterflies
in
the
north
and
at
least
three
in
the
south
as
the
adults
live
for
about
two
months
and
there
is
considerable
variation
in
the
periods
of
their
development
it
happens
that
one
can
find
these
black
swallowtail
butterflies
upon
the
wing
almost
any
time
in
warm
weather
either
north
or
south
giant
the
largest
of
our
north
american
butterflies
is
a
magnificent
insect
with
a
wing
expanse
of
some
four
inches
and
with
a
rich
coloring
of
black
and
yellow
more
or
less
suffused
with
greenish
or
bluish
iridescence
that
gives
it
a
striking
beauty
as
it
flies
leisurely
about
from
flower
to
flower
or
stops
to
lay
an
egg
upon
some
bush
or
tree
the
tails
are
long
and
expanded
toward
the
tip
their
prevailing
color
being
black
with
a
broad
splash
of
yellow
near
the
end
in
a
general
way
we
may
say
that
the
upper
wing
surface
is
black
marked
with

bands

plate
page
the
giant
swallowtail
is
a
tropical
species
which
is
abundant
throughout
the
southern
states
and
during
recent
years
seems
to
have
been
gradually
extending
its
northern
range
it
is
now
commonly
found
as
far
north
as
degrees
latitude
from
nebraska
eastward
in
new
england
it
is
occasionally
taken
in
connecticut
massachusetts
and
even
in
maine
but
its
appearance
in
this
region
is
exceptional
in
the
regions
of
the
southern
states
the
caterpillars
of
this
butterfly
feed
freely
upon
the
leaves
of
citrus
fruits
and
they
are
often
called
orange
puppies
or
orange
dogs
probably
their
curious
appearance
and
their
habit
of
resting
for
long
periods
upon
leaf
or
twig
gave
rise
to
this
name
in
the
region
indicated
the
of
the
insect
may
be
summarized
thus
the
mother
butterfly
deposits
the
eggs
singly
upon
the
young
growth
of
orange
or
other
citrus
fruit
trees
generally
near
the
tips
of
leaves
or
branches
about
a
week
later
each
egg
hatches
into
a
caterpillar
that
feeds
upon
the
young
leaves
resting
upon
the
lower
surface
when
not
eating
after
a
few
days
of
this
feeding
the
caterpillar
becomes
too
large
for
the
skin
with
which
it
was
born
and
it
moults
coming
forth
with
a
new
skin
which
soon
hardens
so
that
it
can
begin
feeding
again
a
week
or
so
later
it
moults
for
the
second
time
and
continues
these
processes
of
feeding
and
moulting
until
full
grown
which
is
perhaps
a
month
from
the
time
of
hatching
from
the
egg
at
first
the
caterpillars
eat
only
the
succulent
young
leaves
and
branches
but
as
they
grow
larger
they
feed
more
freely
upon
the
older
foliage
they
are
very
voracious
and
when
abundant
may
often
do
much
damage
especially
to
young
trees
when
ready
to
change
to
the
chrysalis
each
caterpillar
attaches
itself
by
silken
threads
to
the
bark
of
the
trunk
or
branch
of
the
tree
here
it
changes
to
a
chrysalis
which
takes
on
a
color
so
similar
to
that
of
the
bark
that
the
insect
is
surprisingly
difficult
to
discover
a
fortnight
or
so
later
it
changes
again
into
a
fully
developed
butterfly
that
sallies
forth
in
search
of
the
nectar
of
flowers
plate
page
these
orange
dogs
like
the
caterpillars
of
other
swallowtail
butterflies
have
curious
yellow
scent
organs
which
when
the
caterpillar
is
disturbed
protrude
from
the
upper
surface
just
behind
the
head
these
give
forth
a
very
disagreeable
odor
which
is
believed
to
serve
the
purpose
of
repelling
birds
and
possibly
other
enemies
it
has
been
noticed
that
these
caterpillars
are
not
molested
by
birds
although
they
are
attacked
by
various
insect
enemies
each
mother
butterfly
is
known
to
be
able
to
deposit
four
or
five
hundred
eggs
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
injuries
of
the
caterpillars
may
be
checked
by
shooting
the
butterfly
upon
the
wing
with
cartridges
loaded
with
small
bird
shot
in
the
south
there
are
several
broods
in
a
season
the
of
this
species
in
more
northern
regions
differs
in
the
choice
of
the
food
plant
and
the
number
of
broods
it
feeds
upon
various
members
of
the
rue
family
including
common
rue
and
prickly
ash
as
well
as
upon
certain
poplars
and
probably
other
trees
it
is
two
brooded
and
apparently
winters
as
a
chrysalis
the
butterflies
of
the
first
brood
come
from
the
chrysalis
about
the
last
of
may
and
are
found
on
the
wing
during
june
those
of
the
second
brood
come
from
the
chrysalis
about
the
last
of
july
and
are
found
on
the

during
august
and
september
the
length
of
time
required
from
the
laying
of
the
egg
to
the
emergence
of
the
butterfly
varies
greatly
with
the
locality
and
the
temperature
it
commonly
extends
over
a
period
of
four

suggestive
of
the

take
on
the
colors
of
the
immediate
surroundings
and
thus
be
rather
difficult
to
see
if
the
egg
was
laid
by
one
of
the
spring
or
early
summer
butterflies
the
chrysalis
will
soon
change
to
a
butterfly
which
will
appear
toward
midsummer
and
which
may
lay
eggs
for
another
brood
of
caterpillars
these
caterpillars
mature
to
chrysalids
the
same
season
and
some
of
them
are
believed
to
change
into
butterflies
in
autumn
these
butterflies
hibernating
through
the
winter
while
others
are
believed
to
remain
unchanged
through
the
winter
and
disclose
the
butterfly
the
following
spring
this
is
an
exceptional
condition
for
the
swallowtails
and
it
is
worth
while
to
make
careful
observations
along
its
northern
limits
to
learn
more
definitely
the
facts
as
to
the
winter
condition
this
beautiful
butterfly
is
essentially
a
southern
species
and
is
found
over
a
wide
range
of
territory
from
the
mississippi
river
to
the
atlantic
ocean
it
occurs
as
far
north
as
new
hampshire
and
vermont
and
has
even
been
reported
from
alberta
canada
it
is
easily
recognized
by
the
clouding
of
the
upper
surface
of
the
wings
the
general
color
being
velvety
black
with
distinctive
rows
of
yellow
spots
along
the
margins
of
the
front
wing
these
spots
are
present
also
on
the
hind
wing
where
they
are
almost
changed
to
blue
because
overlaid
with
a
general
cloudiness
of
this
color
on
the
under
surface
of
the
hind
wings
there
are
two
rows
of
spots
the
inner
row
being
nearly
and
the
outer
row
oblong
in
the
living
insect
the
tail
projections
on
the
hind
wings
are
usually
twisted
into
a
vertical
plane
at
right
angles
to
the
plane
of
the
wings
the
caterpillars
of
this
species
feed
upon
the
leaves
of
sassafras
and
spice
bush
the
distribution
of
the
butterfly
appears
to
be
closely
related
to
the
distribution
of
these
plants
as
is
the
case
with
so
many
of
our
swallowtail
butterflies
the
swallowtail
passes
through
the
winter
in
the
chrysalis
stage
late
in
spring
the
butterflies
emerge
and
soon
afterward
lay
their
eggs
singly
upon
the
leaves
of
sassafras
or
spice
bush
the
eggs
soon
hatch
into
caterpillars
largely
covered
with
spiny
warts
each
caterpillar
cleverly
makes
a
protecting
nest
by
eating
out
a
narrow
strip
in
the
leaf
which
frees
a
flap
along
the
margin
that
is
turned
back
upon
the
leaf
making
a
case
in
which
the
larva
lives
it
spins
a
silken
carpet
on
one
side
of
the
case
and
rests
upon
this
carpet
when
at
home
during
its
feeding
periods
it
goes
outside
and
eats
the
tissues
of
the
other
parts
of
the
same
leaf
it
continues
to
occupy
this
first
nest
for
a
week
or
more
by
which
time
the
rest
of
the
leaf
is
likely
to
be
pretty
well
consumed
having
passed
the
first
moult
and
thus
become
larger
and
having
practically
eaten
itself
out
of
its
first
house
and
home
the
caterpillar
now
crawls
to
a
larger
leaf
where
it
proceeds
to
make
a
more
enduring
structure
in
this
case
it
does
not
need
to
bite
a
channel
along
one
side
of
the
midrib
as
it
did
before
but
instead
it
begins
to
spin
silken
threads
transversely
across
the
upper
surface
in
such
a
way
as
to
fold
over
the
border
of
the
leaf
and
make
a
tubular
chamber
in
which
it
has
plenty
of
room
to
move
about
it
uses
this
as
its
home
for
some
time
thereafter
wandering
out
at
evening
to
feed
upon
neighboring
leaves
as
its
hunger
necessitates
in
this
way
it
continues
to
feed
and
grow
for
a
week
or
two
then
it
finds
it
necessary
to
construct
still
another
home
which
it
does
by
bringing
together
the
opposite
sides
of
a
leaf
taking
care
to
have
a
opening
at
the
base
of
the
blade
next
the
leaf
stalk
this
third
home
serves
it
to
the
end
of
its
larval
existence
it
goes
in
and
out
as
necessary
remaining
concealed
when
it
casts
its
skin
and
until
the
body
tissues
harden
afterward
apparently
it
devours
the
cast
skin
and
thrusts
the
hard
covering
of
the
head
out
of
the
nest
consequently
these
little
homes
are
clean
and
sanitary
and
serve
admirably
their
protecting
purpose
the
caterpillars
have
the
curious
appearance
of
those
of
the
other
swallowtails
the
third
ring
behind
the
head
is
greatly
swollen
making
with
the
rings
directly
in
front
of
it
a
characteristic
picture
suggesting
a
grotesque
face
with
large
spots
at
the
top
the
general
color
is
green
darker
above
than
below
and
there
are
six
rows
of
blue
dots
along
the
body
plate
page
when
ready
to
change
to
the
chrysalis
the
caterpillars
desert
their
leafy
homes
and
on
a
twig
or
board
or
stone
each
spins
a
bit
of
silken
webbing
and
a
silken
loop
they
now
change
to
chrysalids
which
are
likely
to
resemble
the
color
of
the
background
and
which
are
somewhat
smoother
than
many
of
the
swallowtail
chrysalids
about
two
weeks
later
the
butterflies
emerge
eclosion
of
the
the
transformation
of
a
chrysalis
into
a
butterfly
is
always
one
of
extraordinary
interest
comparatively
few
definite
descriptions
of
this
process
have
been
given
by
careful
observers
one
of
the
best
of
these
is
that
written
by
scudder
in
connection
with
the
emergence
of
this
butterfly
and
it
is
so
accurate
and
complete
that
it
seems
worth
while
to
quote
it
at
length
the
butterfly
generally
emerges
from
the
chrysalis
early
in
the
day
writes
scudder
and
the
first
signs
of
the
immediate
change
are
strong
forward
and
backward
movements
of
the
chrysalis
at
intervals
of
a
few
seconds
perhaps
the
third
or
fourth
attempt
will
be
successful
when
a
click
may
be
heard
at
the
distance
of
several
feet
but
all
the
subsequent
movements
are
absolutely
noiseless
though
rapid
at
intervals
of
three
or
four
seconds
spasmodic
movements
similar
to
the
first
carry
on
the
process
first
the
split
continues
along
the
thorax
then
it
runs
down
either
side
between
the
legs
and
wings
ultimately
to
the
tips
of
the
antennae
as
this
progresses
the
actions
become
more
strenuous
and
more
frequently
repeated
with
eager
efforts
the
butterfly
pushes
forward
its
head
now
an
antenna
springs
from
its
case
at
once
assuming
its
natural
attitude
the
other
soon
follows
and
then
the
wings
are
partially
drawn
from
their
sheaths
and
while
in
this
position
seem
to
be
used
as
levers
or
arms
to
aid
in
withdrawing
the
rest
of
the
body
next
the
legs
appear
seize
the
upper
part
of
the
chrysalis
skin
and
speedily
withdraw
the
whole
body
it
is
now
a
object
the
wings
wrinkled
and
bloated
and
although
the
whole
process
of
escape
lasts
little
more
than
half
a
minute
already
twice
the
size
of
the
sheaths
they
lately
occupied
the
insect
crawls
upward
until
it
finds
a
secure
resting
place
and
there
remains
until
ready
for
flight
each
half
of
the
tongue
drawn
independently
from
its
receptacle
is
rolled
in
a
separate
spiral
and
now
while
the
wings
are
gradually
expanding
the
insect
applies
all
its
energies
to
uniting
their
two
parts
incessantly
rolls
and
unrolls
them
and
beginning
simultaneously
at
the
base
gradually
fits
them
together
by
their
interlocking
joints
in
about
fifteen
minutes
all
but
the
tips
are
perfectly
united
these
require
nearly
fifteen
minutes
more
and
are
not
fairly
interlocked
until
the
wings
are
fully
expanded
nearly
a
full
half
hour
after
the
escape
from
the
chrysalis
the
wings
however
are
still
tender
and
generally
require
two
hours
to
stiffen
when
at
last
the
insect
ventures
upon
flight
it
is
not
with
an
uncertain
flutter
but
boldly
and
steadily
as
if
long
accustomed
to
the
action
the
butterflies
of
this
second
brood
of
the
season
are
likely
to
begin
to
appear
early
in
august
continuing
to
become
more
abundant
throughout
that
month
these
lay
eggs
upon
the
same
food
plant
and
the
caterpillars
grow
to
maturity
in
the
same
way
as
those
of
the
first
brood
they
become
full
grown
during
september
or
october
and
then
change
to
chrysalids
which
remain
dormant
until
the
following
spring
the
species
thus
has
two
broods
each
year
and
passes
the
winter
only
in
the
chrysalis
state
these
beautiful
butterflies
are
likely
to
be
found
in
the
sort
of
situations
where
the
food
plants
of
the
larvae
are
growing
open
groves
the
borders
of
woods
and
the
margins
of
streams
or
marshes
are
the
places
where
one
is
most
likely
to
find
spice
bush
and
sassafras
these
are
the
places
to
look
for
these
butterflies
which
one
may
often
see
in
graceful
flight
near
the
ground
pausing
now
and
then
to
seek
a
sassafras
leaf
or
to
sip
the
nectar
from
a
flower
tiger
one
of
the
many
things
that
make
a
study
of
the
of
butterflies
of
great
interest
is
the
variations
in
the
development
of
many
of
the
species
one
who
follows
the
simplest
of
a
butterfly
and
sees
the
egg
change
to
larva
and
the
larva
change
in
size
and
form
and
color
with
each
successive
moult
and
then
change
again
into
the
seemingly
inert
chrysalis
from
which
there
finally
comes
the
winged
butterfly
unlike
the
egg
unlike
the
larva
unlike
the
chrysalis
a
creature
of
perfect
beauty
wonderfully
adapted
to
living
freely
in
the
air
and
sipping
ambrosial
nectar
from
the
flowers
one
who
follows
these
changes
with
awakened
vision
can
scarcely
fail
to
have
a
sense
of
wonder
as
to
the
laws
that
govern
such
intricate
phenomena
but
the
marvel
is
still
more
pronounced
in
the
case
of
those
butterflies
which
have
two
or
more
forms
arising
from
the
same
lot
of
eggs
in
a
way
which
science
has
as
yet
not
adequately
explained
the
splendid
tiger
swallowtail
is
an
example
of
this
dimorphism
which
is
of
especial
interest
because
of
the
fact
that
the
extra
form
is
confined
to
one
sex
and
to
only
a
part
of
the
geographical
area
over
which
the
butterfly
is
found
the
species
occurs
over
a
very
large
part
of
the
north
american
continent
being
found
from
ocean
to
ocean
and
from
canada
to
florida
in
the
region
north
of
approximately
the
fortieth
degree
of
latitude
there
is
but
one
form
of
the
insect
the
familiar
striped
butterfly
which
every
one
has
seen
visiting
the
lilac
blossoms
in
may
or
june
south
of
this
however
part
of
the
females
take
on
an
entirely
different
appearance
being
almost
wholly
black
with
the
hind
wings
touched
with
lines
of
blue
and
bordered
with
crescents
of
yellow
and
orange
the
curious
thing
about
it
is
that
a
certain
mother
butterfly
may
lay
a
dozen
eggs
part
of
which
will
develop
into
the
usual
yellow
form
and
the
rest
into
the
black
form
both
lots
being
of
the
same
sex
this
black
form
is
so
entirely
distinct
in
appearance
that
the
two
were
originally
described
as
separate
species
and
they
were
long
considered
such
until
breeding
experiments
determined
the
precise
condition
plate
page
this
species
is
of
interest
also
for
another
reason
the
caterpillars
during
their
later
life
are
remarkable
examples
of
that
curious
resemblance
to
the
head
of
a
serpent
which
is
thought
to
have
a
real
protective
value
in
frightening
away
attacking
birds
and
possibly
other
enemies
the
rings
of
the
body
just
back
of
the
head
are
much
swollen
and
on
the
top
of
the
swollen
part
there
are
two
large
circular
marks
which
bear
a
striking
resemblance
to
eyes
when
the
insect
is
at
rest
it
withdraws
its
head
and
holds
up
the
front
of
the
body
in
such
a
way
as
certainly
to
suggest
at
the
first
glance
that
one
is
looking
at
the
head
of
a
small
snake
an
impression
which
is
likely
to
be
enhanced
when
the
caterpillar
pushes
out
the
curious
yellow
scent
organs
from
the
ring
near
the
top
of
the
head
these
organs
taking
on
the
forked
appearance
of
a
snake
tongue
obviously
it
is
exceedingly
difficult
to
get
definite
observations
under
natural
conditions
to
determine
whether
these
seeming
resemblances
are
really
of
value
to
the
caterpillar
in
frightening
away
birds
or
other
enemies
about
the
only
direct
evidence
which
i
have
come
across
upon
this
point
is
found
in
this
paragraph
by
hancock
when
i
recall
the
first
sight
of
this
larva
the
impression
gained
of
it
was
a
most
curious
one
the
forward
face
was
remarkably
startling
this
mask
bearing
spots
and
the
light
transverse
ridge
gave
it
an
aspect
which
might
easily
be
mistaken
for
real
eyes
and
a
mouth
this
contrivance
is
only
a
false
face
in
no
way
connected
with
the
real
eyes
and
mouth
one
might
imagine
the
shock
that
a
bird
or
other
predaceous
enemy
would
experience
when
looking
upon
this
grinning
mask
this
is
in
reality
the
effect
produced
for
i
have
seen
small
birds
so
alarmed
that
they
lost
their
appetite
and
curiosity
for
these
larvae
after
a
brief
glance
at
them
it
is
certain
that
these
singular
markings
have
the
effect
of
terrifying
their
bird
enemies
b
b
nature
sketches
in
temperate
america
the
yearly
cycle
of
the
tiger
swallowtail
is
much
like
that
of
the
related
species
it
passes
the
winter
as
a
chrysalis
the
butterflies
coming
forth
just
about
the
time
that
the
lilacs
bloom
they
remain
upon
the
wing
for
a
few
weeks
and
deposit
their
eggs
upon
a
great
variety
of
trees
and
shrubs
for
the
food
plants
of
the
larvae
are
unusually
varied
and
include
tulip
trees
birches
wild
cherries
apples
poplars
ash
and
several
other
common
trees
or
shrubs
these
eggs
soon
hatch
into
caterpillars
that
feed
upon
the
leaves
and
make
for
themselves
resting
places
by
spinning
a
web
of
silk
transversely
across
the
surface
of
the
leaf
they
remain
upon
these
silken
webs
when
not
feeding
and
in
later
life
are
likely
to
cause
the
leaf
on
which
the
web
is
made
to
curl
into
a
partial
tube
when
fully
developed
they
change
to
chrysalids
which
give
forth
the
summer
brood
of
butterflies
in
july
and
august
these
in
turn
lay
eggs
for
the
caterpillars
which
change
to
chrysalids
in
autumn
and
remain
in
that
condition
until
the
following
spring
were
one
enough
of
a
magician
to
make
one
butterfly
over
into
another
it
would
be
comparatively
easy
to
take
a
black
swallowtail
and
transform
it
into
this
species
one
would
only
need
to
trim
off
the
long
tails
so
that
they
project
very
slightly
from
the
angles
of
the
hind
wings
and
to
change
the
yellow
spots
to
orange
he
would
thus
accomplish
what
nature
through
the
long
ages
seems
to
have
accomplished
in
a
limited
northern
area
in
newfoundland
and
around
the
gulf
of
lawrence
for
the
papilio
is
confined
chiefly
to
this
region
where
it
lives
a
life
very
similar
to
that
of
the
black
swallowtail
the
caterpillar
feeds
upon
the
leaves
of
various
members
of
the
parsley
family
and
is
said
to
have
learned
to
warm
itself
during
the
middle
of
the
day
by
resting
upon
stones
and
gravel
which
have
absorbed
the
sun
heat
rays
presumably
there
is
but
one
brood
a
year
and
the
insect
hibernates
as
a
chrysalis
palamedes
if
the
magician
who
had
succeeded
in
converting
a
black
swallowtail
into
the
papilio
wished
to
try
his
hand
on
making
a
palamedes
swallowtail
he
could
not
do
better
than
to
use
again
the
same
black
butterfly
he
would
only
need
to
make
it
about
one
half
larger
retaining
practically
all
its
color
markings
and
the
outline
of
its
wings
and
tail
for
this
species
bears
a
remarkable
resemblance
to
the
black
swallowtail
seeming
to
be
a
giant
variety
induced
by
the
warmth
of
the
southern
climate
where
it
lives
and
possibly
by
the
more
generous
supply
of
the
magnolia
and
sassafras
leaves
upon
which
the
caterpillars
feed
this
species
is
distinctly
a
southern
form
occurring
as
far
west
as
the
mississippi
river
throughout
the
more
southern
states
as
one
would
expect
in
the
long
seasons
and
warm
climate
of
this
region
there
are
several
broods
each
year
and
the
caterpillars
often
hibernate
as
well
as
the
chrysalids
the
adult
butterflies
are
lovers
of
the
sun
and
are
said
to
roost
at
night
upon
the
tops
of
live
oak
and
palmetto
trees
zebra
most
of
our
swallowtail
butterflies
are
so
distinctive
in
form
and
colors
that
they
are
easily
distinguished
from
one
another
but
the
zebra
species
is
so
different
from
all
the
rest
that
when
it
is
once
seen
it
is
likely
always
to
be
remembered
the
striking
combination
of
green
and
black
stripes
with
very
long
tails
set
off
by
beautiful
crescents
of
blue
and
of
red
at
once
distinguishes
this
fine
butterfly
in
any
of
its
varying
forms
three
distinct
forms
of
this
species
occur
namely
the
early
spring
form
small
in
size
with
short
tails
that
show
white
only
on
the
tips
the
late
spring
form
somewhat
larger
with
tails
a
little
longer
and
showing
more
white
on
the
outer
half
the
summer
form
decidedly
larger
with
tails
very
long
it
would
be
a
comparatively
simple
matter
to
understand
these
forms
if
they
were
simply
seasonal
variations
with
three
broods
each
form
succeeding
the
other
as
the
season
advances
but
this
is
far
from
being
the
case
we
have
instead
the
most
complicated
and
confusing
series
of
conditions
imaginable
conditions
for
which
no
one
has
yet
given
satisfactory
explanations
to
make
a
fairly
clear
statement
of
what
happens
suppose
we
assume
that
we
start
with
twenty
chrysalids
in
april
ten
of
these
disclose
their
butterflies
which
are
marcellus
the
early
spring
form
in
may
the
other
ten
disclose
their
butterflies
which
are
telamonides
the
late
spring
form
we
thus
have
these
two
forms
appearing
successively
in
spring
from
the
same
set
of
chrysalids
after
flying
about
for
a
short
time
the
marcellus
or
early
spring
swallowtails
lay
eggs
upon
the
leaves
of
papaw
trees
or
bushes
these
eggs
soon
hatch
into
caterpillars
that
feed
upon
the
leaves
and
grow
rather
rapidly
a
little
more
than
a
month
later
they
mature
into
butterflies
which
are
ajax
the
summer
form
in
a
similar
way
the
telamonides
or
late
spring
butterflies
lay
eggs
soon
after
they
appear
also
upon
papaw
leaves
and
these
eggs
in
about
a
month
mature
into
ajax
the
summer
form
so
we
have
ajax
the
summer
form
developing
directly
from
both
the
early
spring
or
marcellus
and
the
late
spring
or
telamonides
butterflies
these
ajax
butterflies
in
their
turn
lay
eggs
for
caterpillar
young
these
soon
mature
into
a
brood
of
butterflies
which
are
of
this
same
ajax
form
there
may
be
successive
broods
through
the
summer
practically
all
of
them
being
this
same
ajax
summer
form
the
last
brood
of
caterpillars
however
change
to
chrysalids
which
do
not
disclose
the
butterflies
until
the
following
spring
and
then
the
first
that
come
out
are
the
marcellus
form
and
the
last
the
telamonides
form
so
we
may
have
these
two
forms
maturing
from
the
same
brood
of
autumn
caterpillars
this
seems
a
sufficiently
complicated
to
suit
the
most
persistent
solver
of
puzzle
problems
but
there
is
an
additional
factor
which
adds
much
to
the
possible
confusion
of
the
broods
in
each
brood
of
caterpillars
from
the
earliest
to
the
latest
there
are
a
certain
number
of
chrysalids
which
remain
dormant
through
the
remainder
of
the
season
and
the
following
winter
maturing
into
butterflies
the
next
spring
consequently
at
the
end
of
every
winter
there
are
a
miscellaneous
lot
of
chrysalids
which
represent
every
brood
of
caterpillars
that
lived
the
previous
season
and
all
of
these
develop
into
either
marcellus
or
telamonides
butterflies
such
a
condition
of
affairs
certainly
represents
what
an
old
new
englander
would
be
likely
to
call
a
mess
and
it
is
difficult
for
science
to
find
rhyme
or
reason
to
explain
it
it
speaks
eloquently
for
the
perseverance
of
edwards
that
he
was
able
with
infinite
patience
through
years
of
study
and
experiment
to
untangle
this
intricate
web
of
butterfly
existence
while
the
preferred
food
plant
of
this
species
is
papaw
the
caterpillars
are
also
known
to
feed
upon
the
spice
bush
and
upland
huckleberry
when
full
grown
these
caterpillars
are
about
two
inches
long
and
of
a
general
color
banded
transversely
with
yellow

black

an
especially
conspicuous

the
most

american
butterflies
are
classified
together
under
the
family
name

the
pierids
three
groups
or
tribes
of
them
are
popularly
known
as
the
whites
the
and
the
yellows
our
two
commonest
butterflies
the
white
or
imported
cabbage
butterfly
and
the
sulphur
yellow
butterfly
are
typical
representatives
of
this
family
most
of
the
rest
like
these
are
of
moderate
size
with
rounded
wings
which
are
more
or
less
marked
with
black
there
are
six
legs
and
the
caterpillars
of
practically
all
the
species
are
cylindrical
greenish
worms
which
under
a
lens
are
seen
to
be
covered
with
short
hairs
when
the
caterpillars
are
ready
to
change
to
chrysalids
they
spin
a
web
of
silk
upon
the
supporting
surface
and
just
back
of
it
a
loop
of
silk
that
serves
to
hold
the
chrysalis
in
place
and
keep
it
from
swaying
back
and
forth
the
chrysalids
are
characterized
by
having
a
pointed
projection
on
the
front
of
the
head
the
rest
of
the
body
being
more
or
less
angular
notwithstanding
their
close
general
resemblance
to
their
food
plants
the
caterpillars
of
this
family
suffer
from
attack
by
various
enemies
birds
find
many
of
them
not
only
eating
them
themselves
but
also
using
them
freely
for
feeding
the
nestlings
parasitic
insects
also
take
a
heavy
toll
from
these
caterpillars
this
attack
of
enemies
is
doubtless
a
chief
reason
why
many
of
the
common
species
are
not
much
more
destructive
the
tribe
of
the
whites
three
white
butterflies
of
approximately
the
same
size
are
found
widely
distributed
over
the
united
states
the
most
abundant
species
is
the
white
or
imported
cabbage
butterfly
the
next
in
abundance
is
probably
the
checkered
white
and
the
rarest
in
most
localities
is
the
white
which
is
a
northern
form
white
or
imported
cabbage
there
is
probably
no
butterfly
which
one
can
generally
find
so
easily
in
its
early
stages
as
the
white
or
imported
cabbage
butterfly
which
is
found
practically
wherever
cabbages
are
grown
and
is
generally
so
abundant
that
caterpillars
and
chrysalids
are
readily
discovered
in
the
northern
states
the
insect
passes
through
the
winter
within
the
chrysalis
coming
forth
rather
early
in
spring
as
the
familiar
white
butterfly
with
black
dots
upon
the
wings
and
blackish
front
angles
of
the
fore
wings
plates
pages
and
the
butterflies
that
thus
appear
in
spring
flit
freely
about
over
fields
meadows
and
gardens
sipping
the
nectar
of
various
early
flowers
through
their
long
coiled
tongues
and
stopping
occasionally
to
alight
upon
the
leaf
of
a
cabbage
or
other
plant
of
the
mustard
family
to
deposit
the
small
pale
yellow
eggs
which
remain
attached
by
a
sort
of
glue
the
adult
butterflies
continue
their
leisurely
life
for
a
fortnight
or
more
thus
extending
the
laying
of
the
eggs
over
a
considerable
period
about
a
week
after
being
deposited
the
egg
hatches
into
a
tiny
green
caterpillar
that
begins
feeding
upon
the
tender
surface
of
the
cabbage
leaf
it
is
commonly
called
the
cabbage
worm
and
it
is
doubtless
the
most
generally
destructive
insect
affecting
this
crop
it
continues
to
feed
for
several
days
before
the
first
moult
after
which
it
becomes
decidedly
larger
and
begins
to
eat
again
more
voraciously
than
before
it
undergoes
several
successive
moults
during
the
next
two
or
three
weeks
before
it
becomes
full
grown
as
a
caterpillar
unlike
most
butterfly
larvae
it
has
changed
very
little
in
its
general
appearance
during
its
growth
it
is
always
of
a
pale
green
color
strikingly
like
the
glaucous
green
of
the
cabbage
leaf
a
fact
which
doubtless
helps
to
conceal
it
from
the
eager
eyes
of
birds
and
other
animals
when
the
caterpillar
is
thus
full
fed
it
is
likely
to
leave
its
food
plant
and
find
shelter
elsewhere
sometimes
it
will
stop
on
the
lower
surface
of
the
outer
leaves
but
more
commonly
it
will
find
a
piece
of
board
an
overhanging
stone
a
or
the
side
of
a
building
where
it
will
prepare
for
the
change
to
the
chrysalis
it
will
do
this
by
spinning
a
silken
thread
upon
the
surface
in
which
to
entangle
its
hind
legs
and
a
loop
of
silk
near
by
with
which
to
hold
its
body
when
these
preparations
are
completed
the
insect
will
cast
its
last
caterpillar
skin
emerging
as
a
grayish
or
brownish
chrysalis
the
color
usually
varying
with
the
color
of
the
surrounding
surface
a
week
or
more
later
the
chrysalis
skin
bursts
open
and
the
white
butterfly
emerges
to
expand
and
dry
its
wings
before
it
flies
away
for
its
leisurely
life
there
are
two
or
more
broods
each
season
the
number
varying
with
the
latitude
there
is
a
decided
variation
in
the
length
of
time
required
for
the
completion
of
the
cycle
from
egg
to
butterfly
in
hot
weather
the
insect
may
mature
in
about
three
weeks
while
in
cooler
weather
it
may
require
as
much
as
five
weeks
introduction
and
while
it
is
well
known
that
a
large
proportion
of
our
most
destructive
insects
have
been
imported
from
europe
it
is
only
in
comparatively
few
cases
that
man
has
been
able
to
make
careful
records
of
the
times
and
places
where
the
insects
were
introduced
and
to
follow
the
spread
of
the
pest
from
these
original
centres
the
imported
cabbage
butterfly
is
one
of
the
few
species
of
which
this
is
true
this
insect
has
been
known
for
centuries
in
europe
where
it
feeds
freely
upon
the
leaves
of
cabbages
and
turnips
so
far
as
known
it
was
first
introduced
into
north
america
about
when
it
appeared
in
quebec
eight
years
later
it
was
again
introduced
into
the
region
of
new
york
city
from
these
two
points
the
insect
spread
gradually
in
various
directions
until
in
it
covered
the
whole
of
new
england
and
various
parts
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
from
then
on
it
spread
even
more
rapidly
and
was
evidently
accidentally
introduced
into
various
parts
of
the
country
which
became
new
centres
of
distribution
of
course
it
would
be
very
easy
for
this
to
happen
through
the
shipment
of
cabbages
from
one
part
of
the
country
to
another
within
thirty
years
of
the
time
of
its
first
introduction
it
had
become
a
serious
pest
over
practically
all
the
united
states
and
canada
the
introduction
and
spread
of
such
a
pest
is
of
interest
in
itself
but
in
this
case
there
is
to
be
noted
the
additional
fact
that
the
presence
of
this
foreigner
has
practically
led
to
the
extinction
of
two
native
species
of
butterflies
both
closely
related
to
each
other
and
to
the
invader
and
both
feeding
upon
the
same
plants
an
almost
pure
white
butterfly
the
white
was
formerly
exceedingly
abundant
in
many
of
the
northern
states
while
farther
south
there
was
another
species
the
checkered
white
which
was
also
abundant
both
of
these
have
now
so
completely
disappeared
that
in
some
localities
they
are
almost
never
seen
while
their
imported
relative
has
become
perhaps
the
most
abundant
of
all
american
butterflies
one
would
naturally
suppose
that
when
a
butterfly
was
reduced
to
the
greatest
possible
simplicity
in
its
coloring
there
would
be
little
chance
for
the
development
of
geographical
or
seasonal
varieties
but
he
would
only
have
to
study
a
large
collection
of
specimens
of
this
species
taken
at
different
seasons
and
in
different
regions
to
find
his
supposition
at
fault
here
is
a
butterfly
which
is
essentially
a
slender
creature
with
four
white
wings
scarcely
touched
with
color
and
yet
we
are
told
that
there
are
eleven
varieties
in
the
united
states
so
distinct
that
they
have
received
scientific
names
not
to
mention
various
others
which
have
been
found
in
europe
this
is
indeed
a
remarkable
showing
and
it
is
a
striking
illustration
of
the
infinite
variations
which
nature
can
produce
with
the
most
limited
materials
to
me
the
seasonal
variations
of
a
butterfly
are
always
of
greater
interest
than
those
which
are
geographical
we
know
that
in
the
case
of
a
great
many
animals
from
insects
to
mammals
the
different
conditions
of
climate
and
physical
environment
found
in
different
regions
produce
variations
of
many
sorts
so
it
does
not
seem
especially
strange
that
in
alaska
there
should
be
a
different
form
of
a
certain
butterfly
than
is
found
in
virginia
but
that
in
the
same
locality
there
should
be
two
or
more
forms
of
a
butterfly
existing
under
identical
conditions
as
to
climate
and
environment
is
not
so
easily
explained
in
the
case
of
the
white
we
collect
in
early
spring
in
new
england
or
other
northern
states
a
lot
of
chrysalids
we
keep
them
until
the
butterflies
come
forth
and
we
find
even
here
two
distinct
forms
one
smaller
and
more
delicate
than
the
other
with
both
surfaces
of
the
wings
pure
white
scientists
call
this
form
the
other
larger
with
the
under
surface
of
the
wings
slightly
tinted
with
yellow
scientists
call
this
form
the
first
named
has
but
one
brood
a
year
while
the
second
lays
eggs
which
develop
into
caterpillars
that
produce
butterflies
of
still
a
form
in
which
the
upper
surface
of
the
wings
is
pure
white
with
a
slightly
greater
expanse
scientists
call
this
form
these
three
varieties
occur
in
eastern
regions
and
may
be
found
in
the
same
localities
and
differ
considerably
from
various
geographical
varieties
found
in
the
far
west
the
caterpillar
of
the
white
is
a
bit
smaller
than
those
of
the
nearly
related
forms
and
in
color
is
green
with
no
distinct
longitudinal
markings
but
with
many
fine
dots
of
black
over
the
surface
the
cylindrical
body
is
covered
with
a
fine
down
when
feeding
upon
cabbage
it
is
more
likely
to
attack
the
outer
than
the
inner
leaves
and
so
even
when
abundant
it
is
less
troublesome
to
gardeners
than
the
imported
species
it
is
now
however
so
rare
that
it
seems
to
feed
chiefly
upon
wild
cruciferous
plants
and
is
more
likely
to
be
found
along
the
borders
of
open
woods
than
in
gardens
and
fields
the
winter
is
passed
in
the
chrysalis
state
checkered
some
years
ago
the
checkered
white
was
commonly
called
the
southern
cabbage
butterfly
but
the
general
distribution
of
the
imported
species
has
had
the
same
effect
upon
its
abundance
in
the
south
that
it
has
had
upon
the
white
in
the
north
consequently
it
is
now
much
less
abundant
than
formerly
even
in
the
southern
states
where
it
is
most
at
home
there
are
two
fairly
distinct
forms
the
spring
form
and
the
summer
form
the
latter
is
practically
of
the
same
size
as
the
imported
cabbage
butterfly
the
males
have
the
hind
wings
nearly
white
above
and
the
fore
wings
with
a
few
black
dots
or
spots
upon
their
outer
halves
the
females
are
much
more
definitely
marked
having
the
upper
surface
of
both
pairs
of
wings
marked
in
black
or
brownish
black
in
such
a
way
as
to
enclose
a
large
number
of
white
diamonds
the
spring
form
is
decidedly
smaller
and
the
markings
are
much
less
distinct
than
in
the
summer
form
the
seasonal
history
of
this
species
is
comparatively
simple
in
winter
the
chrysalids
are
found
from
these
chrysalids
in
early
spring
the
small
butterflies
of
the
spring
form
come
forth
these
lay
eggs
upon
various
cruciferous
plants
which
hatch
into
greenish
caterpillars
that
eat
the
leaves
and
soon
mature
so
far
as
their
caterpillar
stage
is
concerned
they
are
then
about
an
inch
long
with
downy
cylindric
bodies
more
or
less
marked
with
rather
pale
yellow
stripes
touched
here
and
there
with
purplish
green
or
dotted
slightly
with
fine
black
dots
these
caterpillars
now
attach
themselves
by
means
of
a
button
of
silk
and
a
silken
loop
to
some
support
like
a
piece
of
board
the
side
of
a
stone
or
almost
any
available
shelter
each
casts
its
larval
skin
and
appears
as
a
grayish
chrysalis
from
which
probably
a
fortnight
later
the
summer
form
of
the
butterfly
emerges
there
are
commonly
two
broods
of
this
summer
form
making
three
sets
of
butterflies
for
the
entire
season
the
caterpillars
of
the
second
summer
brood
of
butterflies
go
into
the
chrysalis
stage
in
autumn
to
remain
throughout
the
winter
some
very
interesting
observations
upon
the
sleeping
habits
of
this
butterfly
have
been
made
in
louis
by
and
phil
rau
the
insects
were
found
abundantly
resting
upon
the
seed
heads
of
white
snakeroot
early
in
october
when
a
warm
south
wind
was
blowing
the
great
majority
of
the
butterflies
slept
horizontally
with
their
heads
toward
the
wind
at
other
seasons
and
in
other
places
many
of
them
were
found
in
a
vertical
position
but
practically
all
had
their
bodies
toward
the
wind
prevailing
at
the
time
the
observers
were
unable
to
ascertain
definitely
whether
the
insects
thus
oriented
themselves
at
the
time
of
alighting
so
that
their
wings
presented
the
least
resistance
to
the
force
of
the
wind
or
whether
this
was
a
mechanical
result
of
the
breezes
great
southern
there
used
to
be
in
the
northern
states
before
the
advent
of
the
imported
cabbage
butterfly
a
familiar
white
butterfly
which
then
laid
its
eggs
upon
cabbages
in
much
the
same
way
that
the
imported
pest
now
does
one
who
has
seen
this
northern
white
and
then
sees
the
great
southern
white
will
be
likely
to
think
of
the
latter
as
a
larger
edition
of
the
former
for
in
the
males
of
the
southern
species
the
wings
are
practically
white
save
for
a
narrow
dusky
border
at
the
outer
angle
of
the
front
pair
although
in
the
female
this
dusky
margin
is
wider
and
the
hind
wings
show
a
series
of
dusky
triangles
near
the
margin
there
is
also
a
curious
black
marking
suggestive
of
a
crescent
on
each
front
wing
near
the
middle
of
the
front
border
which
helps
to
make
the
appearance
of
this
butterfly
very
distinct
from
that
of
any
other
although
this
species
is
at
times
so
abundant
that
it
swarms
in
great
flocks
and
although
it
has
been
known
for
many
years
its
seems
not
to
have
been
carefully
worked
out
since
it
was
first
described
by
abbott
more
than
a
century
ago
the
caterpillars
feed
upon
cruciferous
plants
and
when
full
grown
are
about
an
inch
and
a
half
long
of
a
general
yellow
color
more
or
less
striped
with
purple
lines
the
species
is
distinctly
tropical
extending
northward
into
our
southern
states
longstaff
reports
this
species
as
abundant
in
jamaica
where
he
found
that
the
clubs
of
the
antennae
of
the
living
insects
showed
a
beautiful
turquoise
blue
color
although
another
observer
described
them
as
bright
green
with
a
tinge
of
blue
this
is
an
interesting
color
variation
for
a
member
of
this
group
in
the
tropics
also
there
are
two
forms
one
belonging
to
the
dry
season
and
one
to
the
wet
season
of

there
is

series
of

on

easily
known
by
its
large
size
the
tribe
of
the
when
one
sees
a
butterfly
flitting
from
flower
to
flower
on
a
bright
june
day
it
seems
one
of
the
most
ethereal
of
earth
visions
one
could
readily
fancy
that
the
whole
sight
flowers
butterflies
and
all
might
easily
vanish
into
thin
air
so
it
is
something
of
a
shock
to
hear
scientists
talk
about
fossil
butterflies
and
to
realize
that
these
fragile
creatures
have
been
living
generation
after
generation
for
untold
millions
of
years
a
realization
of
this
fact
however
helps
us
to
understand
the
many
wonderful
ways
in
which
butterflies
in
all
stages
of
their
existence
have
become
adapted
to
the
conditions
of
their
lives
there
is
perhaps
no
group
of
butterflies
whose
beauty
seems
more
fragile
than
that
of
the
these
are
delicate
creatures
with
slender
bodies
and
almost
gauzy
wings
of
a
size
somewhat
smaller
than
our
common
white
and
yellow
butterflies
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
feature
is
the
marking
of
the
wings
the
upper
sides
of
the
front
pair
having
an
orange
patch
near
the
apex
and
the
under
sides
having
a
background
of
delicate
whitish
or
yellowish
green
lined
and
spotted
with
darker
coloring
in
a
very
characteristic
way
this
peculiar
marking
is
so
significant
that
it
has
been
called
flower
picturing
to
understand
the
reason
for
its
existence
one
has
only
to
watch
the
butterflies
in
their
native
haunts
he
will
find
them
flitting
from
blossom
to
blossom
among
the
plants
of
the
mustard
family
the
this
is
one
of
the
most
characteristic
families
in
the
plant
world
the
foliage
for
the
most
part
is
small
and
delicate
and
the
flowers
have
a
characteristic
structure
being
practically
always
of
small
size
and
generally
toned
in
whites
or
yellows
when
an
is
at
rest
upon
these
blossoms
it
merges
so
completely
into
the
background
that
it
disappears
from
view
should
a
bird
chase
one
of
these
insects
through
the
air
it
would
see
chiefly
the
orange
tips
which
are
so
marked
upon
the
upper
side
of
the
wing
and
when
the
butterfly
closed
its
wings
and
lighted
among
the
flowers
the
orange
color
would
instantly
disappear
and
there
would
be
only
an
almost
invisible
surface
against
the
background
of
flower
and
leaf
the
adaptations
of
these
to
the
conditions
of
their
lives
are
by
no
means
confined
to
this
remarkable
resemblance
to
the
flowery
background
in
the
case
of
some
species
the
whole
yearly
cycle
has
been
adapted
to
correspond
to
the
yearly
history
of
the
cruciferous
food
plant
as
is
well
known
many
species
of
the
mustard
family
spring
up
early
in
the
season
put
forth
their
blossoms
which
quickly
develop
into
fruits
and
then
die
down
the
species
being
carried
through
until
the
next
year
by
the
dormant
seeds
in
a
similar
way
the
feed
as
caterpillars
upon
the
host
plant
through
the
spring
completing
their
growth
before
the
plant
dies
and
then
changing
to
chrysalids
which
remain
dormant
through
summer
fall
and
winter
and
come
forth
as
butterflies
early
the
following
spring
the
insect
has
thus
adapted
itself
in
a
most
remarkable
manner

the
yearly
history
of

is
more
abundant
throughout
the
southern
states
occurring
south
at
least
as
far
as

it
appears
to
be
a
good
illustration
of
the
adaptation
of
its
development
to
that
of
its

laid
upon

upon
stems
leaves

and
even

becoming
mature
in
a
few
weeks
and
changing
to
chrysalids
under
the
protection
of
such
shelter
as
they
can
find
in
the
northern
states
these
chrysalids
remain
unchanged
until
the

when
the
butterflies
emerge
and
are
found
upon
the

for
a
few
weeks
in

the
tribe
of
the
yellows
a
large
proportion
of
our
most
abundant
and
conspicuous
butterflies
belong
to
the
tribe
of
the
yellows
sometimes
it
is
called
the
tribe
of
the
because
the
antennae
of
the
living
insects
are
so
often
red
these
insects
vary
in
size
from
the
large
brimstones
or
cloudless
sulphurs
expanding
three
inches
to
the
delicate
little
dainty
sulphur
expanding
scarcely
an
inch
the
distinctive
characteristics
of
the
tribe
are
found
in
the
very
gradual
enlargement
of
the
joints
of
the
antennae
that
form
the
club
and
the
stout
palpi
the
last
joints
of
each
of
the
latter
being
short
brimstone
or
cloudless
practically
all
northern
butterflies
are
variously
marked
in
different
colors
while
the
butterflies
of
tropical
regions
are
commonly
tinted
in
monotone
though
often
showing
a
splendid
iridescence
one
with
very
little
experience
can
tell
the
look
of
a
tropical
butterfly
and
would
be
likely
to
say
at
once
that
the
cloudless
sulphur
is
one
of
these
the
upper
surface
of
the
wings
of
the
male
is
a
clear
plain
sulphur
with
merely
the
narrowest
possible
fringe
of
brown
around
the
margin
made
only
by
the
colored
marginal
scales
the
under
surface
is
lighter
and
sparsely
dotted
in
brown
in
the
females
the
marginal
brown
takes
on
the
shape
of
a
series
of
small
crescents
and
there
is
a
single
round
brown
just
in
front
of
the
middle
of
each
front
wing
while
the
cloudless
sulphur
is
without
doubt
essentially
a
tropical
species
it
has
an
extraordinary
geographical
range
it
is
extremely
abundant
in
mexico
cuba
and
the
tropical
zone
in
south
america
it
extends
south
even
to
northern
patagonia
and
north
to
new
england
wisconsin
and
nebraska
presumably
in
the
tropics
this
species
breeds
continuously
one
generation
following
another
in
regular
succession
unless
interrupted
by
drought
or
other
natural
phenomena
in
our
southern
states
there
is
more
or
less
interruption
by
the
winter
season
so
that
it
is
commonly
considered
to
have
only
two
broods
the
butterflies
hibernating
farther
north
there
is
probably
only
one
brood
in
summer
and
perhaps
not
even
that
in
the
extreme
limit
of
its
range
for
there
is
pretty
good
evidence
that
the
specimens
seen
in
the
northern
states
are
migrants
from
the
south
coming
singly
or
in
scattered
flocks
in
early
summer
and
if
they
lay
eggs
the
butterflies
of
the
new
generation
return
south
in
autumn
but
the
precise
conditions
are
not
well
known
and
need
careful
observations
in
various
localities
the
of
a
generation
of
these
butterflies
is
much
like
that
of
the
other
yellows
the
eggs
are
laid
one
in
a
place
on
the
leaflets
of
various
species
of
wild
senna
and
soon
hatch
into
cylindrical
caterpillars
that
devour
the
tender
leaflets
in
a
few
weeks
the
caterpillars
mature
and
change
to
curious
and
characteristic
chrysalids
the
head
projects
in
the
shape
of
a
cone
and
the
back
is
so
concave
as
to
give
the
side
view
of
the
chrysalis
a
very
striking
appearance
like
so
many
of
the
yellows
this
butterfly
is
and
social
in
its
habits
great
numbers
flock
together
their
large
size
and
bright
coloring
rendering
them
very
conspicuous
they
often
alight
on
the
ground
to
sip
moisture
when
they
have
been
likened
to
beds
of
yellow
crocuses
they
also
fly
long
distances
in
flocks
that
attract
much
attention
it
is
likely
that
the
northward
distribution
takes
place
in
summer
through
such
migrating
hosts
sulphur
the
large
orange
sulphur
is
a
closely
related
butterfly
of
about
the
same
size
in
which
the
coloring
is
uniformly
instead
of
it
also
belongs
to
the
tropics
occurring
in
our
extreme
southern
states
and
ranging
occasionally
as
far
north
as
nebraska
the
sulphur
is
another
splendid
butterfly
somewhat
larger
than
the
brimstone
which
is
easily
distinguished
by
the
broad
reddish
bar
across
the
upper
surface
of
the
front
wings
it
is
tropical
but
migrates
rarely
even
as
far
north
as
indiana
illinois
and
wisconsin
the
butterfly
furnishes
one
of
the
most
remarkable
examples
of
accidental
resemblance
in
wing
markings
that
can
be
found
in
the
whole
order
of
insects
it
is
comparable
with
the
skull
and
crossbones
on
the
back
of
the
moth
in
the
butterfly
the
middle
of
the
front
wings
has
a
broad
band
of
yellow
against
a
black
margin
on
each
side
and
the
yellow
outlines
make
an
excellent
silhouette
of
the
profile
of
a
poodle
with
a
large
black
in
exactly
the
proper
place
the
females
are
less
brightly
colored
than
the
males
but
they
still
show
the
silhouette
this
is
a
southern
species
which
occasionally
strays
as
far
north
as
new
york
city
new
hampshire
wisconsin
and
iowa
the
larvae
feed
on
species
of
amorpha
and
are
believed
to
be
in
southern
regions
where
the
butterfly
occurs
the
california
is
even
more
beautiful
than
the
southern
species
it
is
remarkable
for
its
pink
and
purple
iridescence
a
characteristic
which
is
not
common
in
the
butterflies
of
the
yellow
and
the
white
tribes
the
silhouette
of
the
is
less
perfect
than
in
the
more
eastern
species
and
the
yellow
color
tones
are
more
tinged
with
orange
the
female
is
strikingly
different
the
wings
being
plain
pale
yellowish
buff
marked
only
with
a
round
blackish
near
the
middle
of
each
front
wing
and
the
barest
suggestion
of
a
dark
line
around
the
extreme
margin
clouded
it
is
an
interesting
fact
that
the
butterfly
which
one
is
most
likely
to
find
in
fields
and
along
roadsides
during
practically
all
the
weeks
of
summer
has
seldom
if
ever
been
noted
as
a
destructive
insect
the
clouded
sulphur
is
probably
the
commonest
species
in
its
group
there
may
be
times
when
the
white
cabbage
butterfly
or
other
forms
are
more
abundant
but
the
clouded
sulphur
retains
its
place
season
after
season
with
comparatively
little
noticeable
variation
in
its
numbers
this
is
doubtless
an
illustration
of
an
insect
which
has
established
such
relations
with
its
food
plants
and
its
various
insect
and
other
enemies
that
it
remains
in
a
fairly
stable
equilibrium
an
example
of
what
is
often
called
the
balance
of
nature
the
clouded
sulphur
is
about
the
only
yellow
butterfly
generally
found
in
the
northeastern
states
the
adults
may
be
seen
from
spring
until
autumn
they
lay
eggs
upon
clover
and
other
plants
these
eggs
hatch
into
small
green
caterpillars
that
feed
upon
the
leaves
and
are
protectively
colored
so
they
are
comparatively
seldom
seen
when
the
food
plant
is
disturbed
they
drop
to
the
ground
crawling
up
again
upon
stems
and
leaves
when
the
disturbance
is
over
these
caterpillars
moult
several
times
during
their
growth
when
full
grown
they
find
such
shelter
as
they
are
able
and
each
spins
a
silken
web
over
part
of
the
surface
it
then
fastens
its
hind
legs
into
this
web
and
later
spins
a
loop
near
the
front
end
of
the
body
it
pushes
itself
beneath
this
loop
and
waits
for
several
hours
before
the
skin
breaks
open
along
the
back
and
is
gradually
shuffled
off
revealing
the
chrysalis
in
position
a
week
or
two
later
the
fully
developed
butterfly
emerges
from
the
chrysalis
these
yellow
butterflies
lend
a
distinctive
charm
to
our
summer
landscapes
they
are
constantly
to
be
seen
fluttering
from
place
to
place
lightly
visiting
flowers
of
many
kinds
from
which
they
suck
the
nectar
and
gathering
in
great
colonies
by
roadside
pools
where
they
seem
to
sip
the
moisture
there
are
many
references
to
this
insect
in
the
writings
of
new
england
authors
it
evidently
was
an
especial
favorite
of
james
russell
lowell
who
has
often
referred
to
it
in
passages
like
this
those
old
days
when
the
balancing
of
a
yellow
butterfly
over
a
thistle
bloom
was
spiritual
food
and
lodging
for
a
whole
forenoon
orange
were
one
able
to
take
a
clouded
sulphur
butterfly
and
change
the
yellow
to
a
deep
orange
color
he
could
easily
make
a
specimen
that
would
pass
for
the
present
species
the
resemblance
is
very
remarkable
and
shows
the
close
affinity
between
these
two
beautiful
insects
like
so
many
others
of
this
group
the
orange
sulphur
is
essentially
a
tropical
species
in
the
eastern
united
states
it
is
rarely
found
north
of
latitude
forty
degrees
but
south
of
that
it
becomes
increasingly
abundant
as
one
approaches
the
tropics
it
occurs
from
the
carolinas
to
texas
and
over
the
great
range
in
which
it
lives
it
takes
on
many
different
forms
and
habits
it
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
examples
of
variation
in
coloring
exhibited
by
any
of
the
butterflies
nearly
a
dozen
species
names
have
been
given
to
its
various
disguises
all
of
which
are
now
recognized
as
synonyms
in
the
more
northern
regions
where
it
is
found
only
one
of
these
forms
usually
occurs
but
in
other
places
bright
yellow
and
pale
white
varieties
are
found
the
of
this
butterfly
along
latitude
forty
degrees
is
very
similar
to
that
of
the
clouded
sulphur
there
seem
to
be
usually
two
broods
and
the
caterpillars
live
upon
leguminous
plants
especially
alfalfa
buffalo
clovers
wild
senna
and
other
species
of
trifolium
and
cassia
apparently
also
it
hibernates
in
both
the
caterpillar
and
the
butterfly
stages
in
the
extreme
southwest
as
on
the
plains
of
texas
the
vegetation
dries
up
completely
in
summer
so
that
there
is
no
succulent
leafage
for
the
caterpillars
to
live
upon
in
such
cases
the
insect
must
aestivate
rather
than
hibernate
this
species
apparently
succeeds
in
doing
this
by
having
the
caterpillars
go
into
a
more
or
less
lethargic
condition
in
which
they
pass
the
summer
the
adult
butterflies
utterly
disappear
in
june
and
are
not
seen
again
until
early
in
autumn
when
the
autumn
rains
have
started
the
growth
of
vegetation
anew
the
insects
then
make
up
for
lost
time
and
produce
several
broods
in
rapid
succession
in
the
imperial
valley
of
california
this
butterfly
is
a
serious
pest
to
alfalfa
growers
it
continues
to
reproduce
throughout
a
very
long
season
one
brood
following
another
from
march
until
december
and
in
mild
winters
there
seems
sometimes
to
be
practically
no
cessation
of
its
activities
wildermuth
found
that
the
development
of
a
generation
in
breeding
cages
in
this
valley
varied
from
to
days
the
latter
in
cool
the
former
in
hot
weather
the
stages
in
the
first
and
the
third
broods
in
spring
varied
thus
egg
first
six
days
third
four
days
larva
first
thirty
days
third
twelve
days
chrysalis
first
eight
days
third
five
days
in
this
case
the
first
generation
extended
from
march
to
april
and
the
third
from
may
to
june
after
the
fourth
brood
of
butterflies
there
was
such
an
overlapping
of
the
various
stages
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
the
broods
this
beautiful
butterfly
was
first
made
known
to
the
world
of
science
by
louis
agassiz
the
great
naturalist
who
did
so
much
to
arouse
a
scientific
interest
among
americans
he
found
it
on
a
famous
expedition
to
the
northern
shores
of
lake
superior
which
not
only
served
to
bring
to
light
many
interesting
phases
of
geological
history
but
also
laid
the
foundation
for
the
copper
mining
industry
which
has
since
become
so
important
in
that
region
the
butterfly
thus
brought
to
light
has
been
found
to
be
a
characteristic
northern
species
occupying
a
rather
narrow
belt
nearly
along
the
fiftieth
degree
of
latitude
and
extending
west
almost
to
the
pacific
coast
the
species
is
occasionally
taken
as
far
south
as
the
white
mountains
and
there
are
indications
that
in
this
region
there
are
two
broods
a
year
the
male
butterflies
are
known
at
once
by
a
beautiful
pink
edge
on
all
the
margins
they
bear
otherwise
a
close
resemblance
to
our
common
sulphur
yellow
the
females
are
much
lighter
in
color
often
having
no
black
markings
on
the
upper
surface
of
the
hind
wings
this
is
essentially
a
tropical
butterfly
which
has
spread
out
over
most
of
our
southern
states
where
it
is
abundant
and
widely
distributed
it
adds
a
distinct
touch
of
color
and
life
to
many
landscapes
when
the
butterflies
swarm
by
thousands
upon
clover
blossoms
and
other
low
vegetation
the
eggs
are
laid
upon
the
leaves
of
clover
and
more
especially
upon
some
common
species
of
cassia
such
as
wild
senna
each
egg
soon
hatches
into
a
small
greenish
cylindrical
worm
colored
and
striped
in
such
a
way
that
as
it
rests
upon
the
leaf
it
is
easily
overlooked
this
larva
develops
rapidly
and
soon
becomes
about
an
inch
and
a
quarter
long
being
rather
slender
and
fairly
smooth
it
now
spins
a
bit
of
silk
upon
a
twig
or
some
similar
support
and
also
the
frailest
sort
of
a
silken
loop
to
pass
around
its
back
it
now
entangles
its
hind
feet
in
the
bit
of
silk
and
soon
casts
off
its
last
caterpillar
skin
emerging
as
a
curious
looking
chrysalis
about
three
quarters
of
an
inch
long
with
a
remarkable
pointed
projection
on
the
front
of
the
head
when
seen
through
a
hand
lens
this
pointed
projection
and
the
characteristic
wing
sheaths
give
the
chrysalis
a
remarkable
resemblance
to
some
of
the
twig
hoppers
or
membracids
the
colors
vary
considerably
with
the
surroundings
but
are
commonly
toned
in
various
shades
of
green
and
yellow
brown
a
little
later
each
chrysalis
breaks
open
to
disclose
one
of
the
beautiful
butterflies
the
conditions
under
which
this
butterfly
lives
at
the
limit
of
its
northern
range
are
not
well
determined
it
is
probable
that
many
of
those
seen
here
have
flown
from
considerably
farther
south
and
that
these
migrants
lay
eggs
from
which
a
brood
of
butterflies
develops
these
native
born
appearing
late
in
summer
presumably
the
latter
hibernate
but
whether
they
can
do
this
successfully
under
the
rigorous
conditions
of
our
northern
winters
has
never
been
determined
in
fact
scudder
wrote
some
years
ago
that
no
caterpillars
had
ever
been
found
in
new
england
here
is
an
interesting
opportunity
for
some
young
observer
to
make
a
real
contribution
to
science
little
were
one
to
imagine
a
clouded
sulphur
butterfly
reduced
to
half
its
usual
size
and
built
with
a
corresponding
delicacy
of
structure
one
would
have
a
pretty
good
idea
of
the
beautiful
little
creature
called
by
the
above
name
i
well
remember
in
my
college
days
taking
what
was
probably
the
first
of
these
butterflies
ever
collected
in
the
region
of
our
michigan
college
it
was
a
prize
that
very
likely
had
wandered
north
from
indiana
but
which
served
to
add
much
glory
to
the
little
collection
in
which
i
took
such
pride
for
this
is
essentially
a
southern
species
in
many
regions
of
the
south
it
is
so
abundant
that
it
can
be
taken
by
any
one
it
ranges
from
coast
to
coast
and
extends
south
into
the
tropics
in
the
eastern
region
it
is
found
from
southern
wisconsin
to
southern
new
england
occurring
sparingly
and
locally
in
various
places
along
the
line
thus
indicated
the
food
plant
of
the
species
is
chiefly
wild
senna
or
other
kinds
of
cassia
the
mother
butterflies
deposit
the
eggs
singly
on
leaves
or
stems
generally
on
the
small
leaflets
of
the
compound
leaf
less
than
a
week
later
each
egg
hatches
into
a
cylindrical
greenish
caterpillar
that
feeds
upon
the
leaflets
in
a
characteristic
fashion
instead
of
devouring
the
blade
from
the
margin
inward
it
gnaws
narrow
strips
between
the
smaller
veins
when
not
feeding
the
caterpillars
protect
themselves
from
observation
by
birds
or
other
enemies
by
resting
motionless
along
the
stem
of
the
leaflet
or
else
along
the
midrib
on
the
under
side
as
is
well
known
the
leaflets
of
cassia
like
other
leguminous
plants
close
at
night
it
is
probably
on
this
account
that
these
caterpillars
feed
chiefly
by
day
the
general
green
color
of
the
skin
and
the
straight
stripe
along
the
side
help
to
make
this
caterpillar
very
inconspicuous
when
it
is
at
rest
when
full
grown
the
caterpillar
reaches
a
length
of
three
quarters
of
an
inch
it
now
finds
some
bit
of
shelter
on
which
it
spins
a
bit
of
flat
web
and
a
silken
loop
to
hold
it
in
place
as
it
becomes
a
chrysalis
it
then
changes
and
remains
quiescent
for
ten
days
or
more
when
it
emerges
as
the
dainty
butterfly
notwithstanding
its
abundance
and
its
successive
broods
its
is
none
too
completely
worked
out
there
is
still
opportunity
for
careful
observations
upon
the
way
in
which
it
passes
the
winter
in
various
parts
of
its
range
while
in
the
south
it
apparently
hibernates
as
an
adult
this
fact
is
not
certain
in
the
more
northern
localities
notwithstanding
its
diminutive
size
this
butterfly
has
been
known
to
swarm
in
such
enormous
numbers
as
to
seem
a
veritable
cloud
the
most
notable
record
of
this
has
been
quoted
by
scudder
in
connection
with
a
swarm
that
invaded
the
bermuda
islands
in
on
the
first
day
of
october
it
was
described
in
these
words
early
in
the
morning
several
persons
living
on
the
north
side
of
the
main
island
perceived
as
they
thought
a
cloud
coming
over
from
the
northwest
which
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
shore
on
reaching
which
it
divided
into
two
parts
one
of
which
went
eastward
and
the
other
westward
gradually
falling
upon
the
land
they
were
not
long
in
ascertaining
that
what
they
had
taken
for
a
cloud
was
an
immense
concourse
of
small
yellow
butterflies
which
flitted
about
all
the
open
grassy
patches
in
a
lazy
manner
as
if
fatigued
after
their
long
voyage
over
the
deep
fishermen
out
near
the
reefs
some
few
miles
to
the
north
of
the
islands
very
early
that
morning
stated
that
numbers
of
these
insects
fell
upon
their
boats
literally
covering
them
as
is
the
case
with
so
many
of
the
related
yellow
butterflies
there
is
an
albino
variety
of
this
species
it
has
been
given
the
variety
name
although
it
is
really
a
pale
yellow
rather
than
a
true
albino
form
dainty
while
the
little
sulphur
butterfly
seems
about
as
delicate
a
creature
as
one
could
ask
to
see
it
loses
that
distinction
when
it
is
compared
with
the
still
smaller
dainty
sulphur
the
latter
expands
scarcely
an
inch
when
its
wings
are
stretched
apart
and
its
slender
body
and
antennae
help
to
give
the
suggestion
of
extreme
delicacy
there
is
more
marking
of
black
upon
the
wings

is
the
case
with
the

passed
the
winter

shelter
in

exposed
to
the
storm
and
stress
of
the
weather
when
the

these

are
laid
in
clusters
encircling
the
twigs
there
being
twenty
or
more
in
each
cluster
in
the
act
of
oviposition
the
butterfly
keeps
her
wings
spread
out
moving
the
body

abdomen
about
as
the
placing
of
the
eggs
necessitates
about
two
weeks
after
the

that
serves
as

for

they
moult

it
rapidly
assumes
a
definite
form
that
of
the
chrysalis
which
is
grayish

different

varying
somewhat
in

in
this
quiet
chrysalis
the
insect
is
apparently
almost
as
inert
as
a
mummy
if
you
touch
it
it
will
wriggle
a
little
but
otherwise
it
hangs
there
mute
and
helpless
on
the
inside
however
the
tissues
are
being
made
over
in
such
a
wonderful
way
that
in
about
two
weeks
from
the
mummy
case
into
which
the
caterpillar
entered
there
comes
a
beautiful
butterfly
when
this
butterfly
first
breaks
through
the
mummy
shell
its
wings
are
very
small
although
its
body
antennae
and
legs
are
well
developed
by
means
of
the
latter
it
clings
to
the
empty
chrysalis
while
its
wings
expand
at
first
these
wings
are
short
but
as
soon
as
the
insect
takes
a
position
in
which
the
wings
hang
downward
they
begin
to
expand
and
soon
reach
full
length
but
are
more
or
less
crumpled
longitudinally
and
the
front
wings
are
not
so
wide
as
the
hind
ones
hanging
limply
inside
the
latter
after
the
butterfly
has
thus
reached
its
full
form
and
size
it
crawls
from
the
chrysalis
to
some
neighboring
support
where
it
rests
quietly
for
half
an
hour
or
more
during
the
latter
part
of
this
time
it
exercises
its
unused
muscles
by
slowly
opening
and
closing
its
wings
until
it
finally
flies
away
the
tribe
of
the
fritillaries
this
is
one
of
the
most
distinctive
tribes
of
the
family
of
nymphs
the
clubs
of
the
antennae
are
about
twice
as
long
as
broad
and
curiously
the
palpi
are
large
and
bushy
with
the
last
joint
very
short
most
of
the
species
are
rather
large
and
practically
all
are
beautifully
mottled
in
various
tones
of
brown
red
black
and
silvery
gray
a
large
proportion
of
our
midsummer
butterflies
are
members
of
this
tribe
gulf
in
tropical
america
there
is
a
genus
of
butterflies
called
agraulis
these
are
fairly
large
insects
approximating
the
size
of
the
viceroy
which
show
most
beautiful
colors
in
the
tropical
sunshine
one
member
of
this
genus
has
come
north
to
our
southern
states
and
is
occasionally
found
as
far
up
as
virginia
and
southern
illinois
extending
below
this
from
ocean
to
ocean
it
reveals
on
its
upper
surface
the
most
exquisite
tints
of
iridescent
purples
and
browns
suggesting
by
its
form
and
color
as
thus
seen
a
tropical
species
the
lower
wing
surface
when
the
wings
are
closed
in
their
natural
position
shows
only
a
spangled
effect
of
and
brown
which
is
very
suggestive
of
the
under
surface
of
our
northern
spangled
fritillaries
so
this
beautiful
species
may
fittingly
be
called
the
gulf
fritillary
carrying
over
from
the
north
some
of
its
peculiar
beauty
and
connecting
with
the
equally
distinctive
beauty
of
the
tropical
south
like
so
many
other
southern
butterflies
the
eggs
of
this
species
are
laid
upon
the
leaves
of
passion
vines
the
caterpillars
develop
very
rapidly
and
when
matured
are
yellowish
or
brownish
yellow
striped
with
darker
lines
along
the
back
and
sides
there
are
black
branching
spines
arranged
in
rows
beginning
on
the
head
and
running
backward
on
the
body
the
whole
cycle
of
life
from
egg
to
butterfly
may
take
place
within
the
short
period
of
a
month
and
one
brood
succeeds
another
in
so
irregular
and
rapid
a
fashion
that
it
is
difficult
to
determine
definitely
the
number
of
broods
in
a
season
variegated
there
is
something
in
the
appearance
of
the
upper
surface
of
this
butterfly
that
suggests
the
other
fritillaries
on
the
one
hand
and
the
emperors
on
the
other
the
coloring
and
marking
is
a
bit
like
the
former
and
the
shape
of
the
wings
like
the
latter
the
general
color
is
a
golden
brown
with
darker
markings
arranged
in
bands
and
in
a
rather
complicated
pattern
the
under
surface
so
far
as
it
is
exposed
when
the
butterfly
is
at
rest
is
a
beautiful
marbled
combination
of
gray
and
brown
which
is
probably
distinctly
obliterative
in
the
haunts
of
these
insects
the
front
wings
have
the
outer
margin
concave
in
the
middle
giving
a
special
prominence
to
the
shape
of
each
front
outer
angle
this
butterfly
is
a
southern
rather
than
a
northern
species
but
it
is
found
occasionally
from
montana
to
massachusetts
and
southward
to
arizona
mexico
and
florida
even
in
northern
indiana
it
is
very
seldom
found
and
is
considered
rare
in
the
southern
part
of
that
state
around
buffalo
new
york
it
is
also
rare
and
is
not
common
in
the
vicinity
of
new
york
city
in
the
more
southern
states
however
it
is
abundant
and
extends
well
through
the
continent
of
south
america
there
is
considerable
evidence
to
indicate
that
this
butterfly
hibernates
as
an
adult
in
the
more
southern
regions
it
probably
also
hibernates
in
other
stages
especially
the
chrysalis
and
the
larva
in
regions
where
it
is
as
it
appears
to
be
in
the
latitude
of
new
york
city
the
seasonal
history
seems
to
run
something
like
this
the
partly
grown
caterpillars
which
have
passed
the
winter
in
shelter
at
the
surface
of
the
soil
feed
upon
the
leaves
of
violets
and
certain
other
plants
they
change
to
chrysalids
probably
in
may
and
emerge
as
butterflies
in
june
these
butterflies
lay
eggs
for
a
summer
brood
of
caterpillars
which
may
feed
upon
the
leaves
of
violets
may
apples
portulaca
and
stonecrop
they
grow
into
cylindrical
worms
of
a
general
reddish
yellow
color
marked
by
longitudinal
stripes
of
brown
upon
the
sides
and
a
row
of
whitish
dots
upon
the
back
they
become
matured
in
time
to
disclose
the
butterflies
of
the
second
brood
in
august
and
september
presumably
these
butterflies
lay
eggs
that
develop
into
caterpillars
which
hibernate
when
partially
grown
farther
south
there
are
probably
three
broods
a
year
and
hibernation
may
take
place
in
various
stages
there
is
good
opportunity
for
careful
work
in
determining
the
of
the
species
in
different
latitudes
the
butterfly
is
found
in
much
the
same
situations
as
the
other
fritillaries
flying
over
meadows
and
along
the
borders
of
woods
diana
this
magnificent
butterfly
differs
from
the
other
fritillaries
in
the
fact
that
the
females
are
so
unlike
the
males
that
only
a
skilled
naturalist
would
even
guess
that
they
are
related
both
sexes
are
rather
rare
and
are
found
only
in
a
comparatively
narrow
range
extending
from
west
virginia
to
missouri
northward
to
ohio
and
indiana
and
southward
to
georgia
and
arkansas
this
species
was
first
described
by
cramer
a
long
time
ago
from
specimens
of
the
male
sex
it
was
later
described
by
say
and
other
writers
all
of
whom
saw
only
the
males
the
other
sex
was
first
recognized
by
william
edwards
whose
account
of
its
discovery
as
given
in
his
splendid
work
on
the
butterflies
of
north
america
is
worth
quoting
no
mention
is
made
of
the
female
by
any
author
wrote
edwards
and
it
seems
to
have
been
unknown
till
its
discovery
by
me
in
in
kanawha
county
west
virginia
on
the
august
i
saw
for
the
first
time
a
male
hovering
about
the
flowers
of
the
and
succeeded
in
taking
it
two
days
afterwards
in
same
vicinity
while
breaking
my
way
through
a
dense
thicket
of
the
same
weed
hoping
to
find
another
diana
i
came
suddenly
upon
a
large
black
and
blue
butterfly
feeding
so
quietly
as
to
allow
me
to
stand
near
it
some
seconds
and
watch
its
motions
it
seemed
to
be
a
new
species
of
limenitis
allied
to
ursula
which
it
resembled
in
color
but
on
taking
it
i
saw
it
was
a
female
argynnis
and
the
general
pattern
of
the
under
wing
left
little
doubt
of
its
affinity
to
the
diana
male
despite
its
total
difference
in
color
and
of
upper
surface
subsequent
captures
confirmed
this
conjecture
and
out
of
the
large
number
that
have
since
been
taken
the
males
have
been
of
the
known
type
and
the
females
black
with
no
tendency
in
either
to
vary
in
the
direction
of
the
other
when
my
attention
was
called
to
the
species
i
found
it
not
very
uncommon
always
upon
or
near
the
which
is
very
abundant
and
grows
in
rank
luxuriance
upon
the
rich
bottom
lands
of
the
kanawha
river
frequently
reaching
a
height
from
eight
to
ten
feet
and
in
august
covered
by
heads
of
purple
flowers
that
possess
a
remarkable
attraction
for
most
butterflies
both
sexes
are
conspicuous
the
males
from
the
strong
contrast
of
color
and
the
females
from
their
great
size
and
the
habit
of
alighting
on
the
topmost
flower
and
resting
with
wings
erect
and
motionless
it
is
an
exceedingly
alert
and
wary
species
differing
in
this
from
our
other
argynnids
at
the
slightest
alarm
it
will
fly
high
into
the
woods
near
which
upon
the
narrow
bottoms
or
river
slopes
it
is
invariably
found
it
is
a
true
southern
species
sensitive
to
cold
not
to
be
looked
for
in
the
cooler
part
of
the
morning
but
flying
down
from
the
forest
when
the
sun
is
well
up
from
eleven
to
three
is
its
feeding
time
the
of
this
fine
butterfly
is
similar
to
that
of
the
lesser
fritillaries
the
butterflies
appear
from
midsummer
onward
the
males
preceding
the
females
and
the
eggs
are
laid
on
or
near
violets
in
august
or
september
the
larvae
hibernate
and
mature
early
the
following
summer
as
they
approach
the
chrysalis
stage
they
are
rather
large
velvety
black
caterpillars
with
brown
heads
and
rows
of
fleshy
barbed
spines
that
show
an
orange
tint
at
their
bases
there
is
thus
but
one
generation
each
year
regal
the
regal
fritillary
fresh
from
the
chrysalis
still
showing
the
marvelous
sheen
of
its
iridescence
furnishes
one
of
the
most
beautiful
exhibitions
of
color
in
the
world
of
nature
over
the
whole
wing
surface
there
are
tiny
scales
that
reflect
the
sunlight
in
an
almost
dazzling
manner
giving
a
distinct
purplish
tone
especially
to
the
hind
wings
the
regal
fritillary
is
one
of
the
largest
butterflies
of
the
distinctive
group
to
which
it
belongs
the
wings
expand
some
three
inches
and
the
rather
thick
body
is
more
than
an
inch
long
the
general
ground
color
of
the
wings
is
brown
with
distinct
markings
of
blackish
which
in
the
hind
wings
almost
obscure
the
brown
on
each
of
the
latter
as
seen
from
above
there
is
a
distinct
row
of
spots
across
the
middle
duplicated
by
a
similar
row
of
brown
spots
near
the
margin
the
under
surface
of
both
pairs
of
wings
is
much
lighter
and
thickly
mottled
all
over
with
light
spots
of
a
large
size
and
more
or
less
triangular
shape
like
the
other
argynnids
the
regal
fritillary
is
during
the
year
and
it
has
a
rather
remarkable
longevity
in
each
stage
of
its
life
the
newly
hatched
caterpillars
go
into
hibernation
and
live
through
the
winter
without
feeding
finding
shelter
at
the
surface
of
the
ground
especially
beneath
the
leaves
of
violets
which
form
their
chosen
food
plants
when
the
snow
has
disappeared
and
the
warmth
of
the
spring
sun
brings
them
out
of
their
winter
lethargy
these
tiny
caterpillars
feed
upon
the
violet
leaves
and
grow
slowly
for
several
weeks
they
then
change
to
chrysalids
the
time
for
doing
this
varying
considerably
with
the
individual
and
doubtless
with
the
warmth
of
the
situation
in
which
each
is
living
the
length
of
time
spent
in
the
chrysalis
varies
also
but
in
general
it
seems
to
be
less
for
those
which
develop
into
male
butterflies
than
for
the
females
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
the
former
may
be
found
for
nearly
two
weeks
before
any
of
the
latter
appear
the
first
butterflies
of
this
species
are
usually
disclosed
from
the
chrysalis
late
in
june
or
early
in
july
they
continue
to
come
forth
for
several
weeks
apparently
until
nearly
the
middle
of
august
they
lead
a
leisurely
life
visiting
freely
the
flowers
of
goldenrod
boneset
joe
pye
weed
and
especially
swamp
milkweed
they
are
most
likely
to
be
found
in
lowlands
and
along
the
borders
of
swamps
where
these
favorite
flowers
are
growing
it
evidently
requires
some
time
for
the
eggs
to
develop
within
the
ovaries
for
the
butterfly
can
not
begin
laying
these
until
the
latter
part
of
august
they
apparently
are
normally
deposited
on
the
under
side
of
violet
leaves
although
so
far
as
i
know
no
butterfly
has
been
seen
thus
laying
her
eggs
it
would
be
an
interesting
point
for
some
young
observer
to
determine
even
the
eggs
take
a
long
time
to
develop
not
hatching
for
three
or
four
weeks
after
they
are
laid
when
they
do
hatch
the
tiny
caterpillars
seem
not
to
eat
at
all
but
to
go
directly
into
hibernation
these
butterflies
are
to
be
found
in
their
preferred
habitats
almost
any
time
during
july
august
and
september
apparently
many
of
them
live
as
adults
for
nearly
three
months
so
that
whether
we
consider
the
egg
the
larva
the
chrysalis
or
the
adult
we
have
in
this
species
an
unusual
duration
of
life
this
is
doubtless
an
adaptation
to
the
fact
that
the
species
must
get
through
the
year
with
only
one
brood
this
unity
of
habit
with
no
such
variations
as
occur
in
many
butterflies
with
a
wider
range
north
and
south
is
apparently
correlated
with
the
distribution
of
this
butterfly
it
is
found
in
a
belt
of
territory
running
from
new
england
and
the
atlantic
states
westward
at
least
to
nebraska
along
a
line
which
approximates
the
annual
isotherm
of
fifty
degrees
fahrenheit
great
spangled
to
one
who
wanders
much
in
the
woods
and
open
fields
there
are
few
summer
scenes
more
characteristic
of
the
season
than
that
of
a
group
of
milkweeds
in
full
flower
surrounded
by
a
host
of
brown
butterflies
busily
sucking
the
nectar
from
the
curious
pink
blossoms
there
are
likely
to
be
several
species
of
these
winged
creatures
but
in
many
regions
of
america
the
largest
and
most
conspicuous
will
generally
be
the
great
spangled
fritillary
this
butterfly
is
easily
recognized
by
its
large
size
and
its
combination
of
two
colors
of
brown
with
whitish
or
silverish
spots
scattered
over
the
lower
surface
of
the
wings
the
of
this
insect
is
of
peculiar
interest
on
account
of
the
way
in
which
it
passes
the
winter
the
mother
butterfly
remains
upon
the
wing
through
many
weeks
in
summer
so
that
toward
the
end
of
august
or
early
september
a
large
proportion
of
the
specimens
have
a
decidedly
frayed
appearance
they
are
patiently
waiting
for
the
season
of
the
year
when
they
can
deposit
their
eggs
apparently
knowing
by
instinct
that
this
must
not
be
done
until
early
autumn
when
the
proper
season
arrives
they
lay
their
eggs
upon
the
leaves
or
stems
of
wild
violets
apparently
without
much
reference
to
the
particular
species
sometimes
they
have
been
reported
simply
to
drop
the
eggs
loosely
upon
the
violet
plant
with
no
attempt
to
fasten
them
in
place
having
thus
deposited
the
eggs
the
mother
butterflies
soon
die
it
would
not
seem
strange
if
these
eggs
remained
unhatched
until
the
following
spring
but
the
fact
is
that
the
eggs
hatch
very
soon
into
small
caterpillars
that
eat
off
part
of
the
shells
in
order
to
escape
and
sometimes
eat
also
part
of
the
shell
remaining
after
they
have
emerged
various
good
observers
have
apparently
established
the
fact
that
these
tiny
caterpillars
eat
nothing
else
before
winter
sets
in
it
seems
curious
indeed
that
they
should
not
nibble
at
the
leaves
or
stems
of
the
violet
plants
in
order
to
be
slightly
prepared
for
the
long
fast
that
awaits
them
before
they
will
find
food
upon
the
young
buds
the
following
spring
the
case
is
somewhat
similar
to
that
of
the
common
tent
caterpillar
which
becomes
a
fully
formed
caterpillar
within
the
egg
shell
before
the
end
of
autumn
but
remains
unhatched
until
the
following
spring
in
the
present
case
the
caterpillar
hibernates
outside
of
the
egg
shell
rather
than
within
it
when
at
last
the
warm
sunshine
of
spring
starts
the
violets
into
new
growth
the
tiny
caterpillars
begin
feeding
upon
the
succulent
tissues
they
nibble
away
day
after
day
for
a
week
or
more
before
they
become
so
large
that
they
have
to
cast
their
skin
for
the
first
time
they
then
feed
again
and
continue
this
process
of
feeding
and
moulting
until
early
in
summer
they
are
likely
to
hide
themselves
during
daylight
and
have
the
reputation
of
being
difficult
to
rear
under
artificial
conditions
the
caterpillar
wanders
along
the
surface
of
the
ground
in
search
of
suitable
shelter
for
the
chrysalis
period
when
it
comes
to
a
large
stone
with
sides
projecting
more
or
less
horizontally
or
a
log
lying
upon
the
ground
or
even
a
large
piece
of
loose
bark
it
is
likely
to
stop
and
change
to
the
pupa
or
chrysalis
in
this
condition
it
is
dark
brown
in
color
and
well
covered
with
thickened
tubercles
especially
along
the
back
of
the
abdomen
about
a
fortnight
later
the
chrysalis
breaks
open
and
the
fully
developed
butterfly
comes
forth
it
rests
quietly
for
a
time
while
its
wings
expand
and
the
tissues
harden
and
then
sallies
forth
for
its
long
period
of
flight
for
this
insect
is
in
the
northern
states
at
least
and
the
butterflies
that
thus
mature
late
in
june
or
early
in
july
are
likely
to
remain
alive
until
early
in
september
so
they
have
a
comparatively
long
life
for
a
butterfly
that
does
not
hibernate
as
an
adult
our
brown
fritillaries
are
seldom
found
without
several
species
mingling
together
this
is
not
strange
for
they
have
similar
habits
throughout
their
entire
lives
so
when
you
see
a
bevy
of
butterflies
collected
around
the
midsummer
blossoms
of
the
milkweed
you
are
pretty
sure
to
find
that
the
great
spangled
fritillary
is
associated
with
the
and
probably
one
or
two
other
related
forms
the
is
generally
decidedly
smaller
than
the
one
first
named
and
the
surest
way
to
be
certain
of
it
is
to
look
on
the
under
side
of
the
hind
wing
and
see
whether
there
is
a
broad
band
of
buff
between
the
two
outer
rows
of
silver
spots
if
this
band
has
disappeared
or
is
nearly
all
taken
up
by
the
brown
of
the
wing
you
may
be
pretty
sure
we
have
the
fritillary
when
one
has
firmly
fixed
in
mind
the
life
cycle
of
one
of
these
butterflies
one
has
a
model
after
which
to
fashion
the
rest
for
our
several
species
are
remarkably
alike
in
this
respect
the
are
on
the
wing
for
several
weeks
in
summer
during
the
latter
part
of
this
time
the
females
lay
eggs
upon
violet
leaves
these
eggs
shortly
hatch
into
caterpillars
that
go
directly
into
hibernation
taking
no
food
before
winter
sets
in
the
following
spring
they
feed
upon
violet
leaves
and
mature
in
time
to
change
to
chrysalids
and
emerge
as
butterflies
in
early
summer
there
is
but
one
brood
a
year
and
the
species
is
widely
distributed
over
southern
canada
and
the
northern
states
it
extends
south
to
virginia
and
pennsylvania
and
west
to
nebraska
montana
and
washington
mountain
if
one
were
able
to
take
a
fritillary
and
reduce
its
size
about
one
third
he
would
have
a
wonderfully
good
imitation
of
the
present
species
except
for
the
size
about
the
only
difference
in
the
markings
is
found
in
the
blackish
border
along
the
margins
of
the
mountain
which
is
not
present
in
the
other
species
the
buff
border
line
on
the
under
surface
of
the
wings
between
the
rows
of
silver
spots
is
also
wider
in
the
mountain
species
the
distribution
of
this
butterfly
justifies
its
name
it
is
preëminently
a
northern
species
being
especially
abundant
in
the
white
mountains
of
new
hampshire
and
ranging
northward
far
into
canada
and
west
through
british
america
as
far
as
the
mackenzie
river
a
pair
of
these
butterflies
were
captured
by
merritt
carey
on
july
on
the
summit
of
mount
in
the
nahanni
mountains
at
an
altitude
of
feet
the
southern
limit
of
its
distribution
approximates
the
isotherm
of
degrees
it
extends
southward
in
mountainous
regions
through
new
york
and
pennsylvania
and
is
found
in
michigan
illinois
and
iowa
it
also
occurs
in
the
rocky
mountain
region
of
colorado
the
various
species
of
argynnis
show
a
remarkable
uniformity
in
their
like
the
others
this
butterfly
is
laying
the
eggs
on
or
near
violets
late
in
summer
the
eggs
hatching
into
larvae
that
take
no
food
until
the
following
spring
they
then
feed
upon
the
violet
leaves
become
mature
and
change
to
chrysalids
in
time
for
the
butterflies
to
emerge
in
june
in
new
hampshire
these
butterflies
remain
upon
the
wing
for
several
weeks
they
usually
appear
a
week
or
two
earlier
than
aphrodite
or
cybele
in
regions
where
all
three
species
are
found
it
is
worth
while
for
the
collector
to
take
a
hint
from
this
fact
and
do
his
collecting
early
for
after
the
other
species
appear
it
is
not
so
easy
to
tell
which
is
atlantis
when
the
butterflies
are
on
the
wing
it
is
most
likely
to
be
found
in
open
places
in
the
woods
apparently
preferring
such
situations
to
the
broad
expanse
of
fields
and
meadows
white
mountain
this
is
distinctly
a
mountain
butterfly
known
to
be
found
only
near
the
top
of
mount
washington
and
other
neighboring
parts
of
the
white
mountains
it
generally
occurs
between
the
altitudes
of
four
thousand
and
hundred
feet
it
is
doubtless
closely
related
to
a
somewhat
similar
form
found
farther
north
and
west
but
its
isolation
from
them
is
complete
apparently
it
is
and
very
little
is
known
of
the
early
stages
the
butterflies
visit
the
flowers
of
goldenrod
and
those
of
the
alpine
which
are
abundant
in
the
home
of
this
species
this
variety
is
interesting
as
a
living
souvenir
of
the
day
when
new
england
was
buried
beneath
the
meadow
the
fact
of
variation
is
one
of
the
most
universal
things
in
nature
no
two
animals
are
exactly
alike
and
every
plant
differs
from
every
other
plant
that
this
is
true
of
the
structure
of
living
things
is
easily
observed
but
it
is
not
so
well
known
because
not
so
easily
observed
that
most
species
of
animals
differ
also
in
the
precise
phases
of
their
growth
we
know
that
the
variation
in
form
and
color
has
brought
about
the
remarkable
adaptations
to
surroundings
which
we
call
mimicry
and
protective
coloration
a
little
consideration
will
make
it
evident
that
the
variation
of
different
individuals
in
periods
of
growth
must
have
led
also
to
the
adaptation
of
the
life
stages
to
the
conditions
of
the
changing
seasons
this
is
particularly
true
in
the
great
majority
of
insects
which
show
remarkable
adaptations
in
their
various
broods
to
the
seasonal
conditions
of
the
localities
where
they
live
from
this
point
of
view
the
attractive
little
meadow
fritillary
is
of
especial
interest
we
are
indebted
to
the
studies
of
scudder
for
our
knowledge
of
the
remarkable
variations
in
its
growth
these
are
so
complicated
that
in
order
to
make
plain
the
varying
conditions
it
seems
necessary
to
separate
the
broods
in
a
somewhat
hypothetical
manner

we
will
begin
with
what
we
shall
call
group
a
the
butterflies
are
on
the
wing
in
may
and
early
june
they
have
just
come
from
the
chrysalis
and
continue
living
for
three
or
four
weeks
before
they
deposit
eggs
this
time
being
required
in
order
that
the
eggs
may
develop
in
the
ovaries
of
the
butterflies
these
eggs
hatch
in
about
a
week
and
the
caterpillars
become
full
grown
a
month
later
they
then
change
to
chrysalids
in
which
condition
they
remain
another
week
thus
requiring
five
or
six
weeks
for
the
newly
laid
eggs
to
mature
into
butterflies
supposing
the
eggs
were
laid
the
first
week
in
june
the
butterflies
of
this
second
brood
would
appear
about
the
middle
of
july
the
eggs
in
the
ovaries
of
some
of
these
butterflies
also
require
several
weeks
before
they
are
ready
to
be
laid
so
that
it
may
be
about
the
tenth
of
august
when
this
happens
these
hatch
and
mature
to
chrysalids
during
the
next
six
weeks
the
butterflies
of
this
brood
emerging
about
the
middle
of
september
these
in
turn
lay
eggs
at
once
apparently
no
extended
period
being
required
for
their
development
before
they
are
laid
the
eggs
hatch
during
the
latter
part
of
september
and
the
young
caterpillars
feed
upon
the
violet
leaves
for
two
or
three
weeks
moulting
perhaps
twice
and
becoming
approximately
half
grown
they
now
stop
feeding
and
go
into
a
lethargic
condition
in
which
they
hibernate
then
in
spring
they
awaken
and
feed
again
upon
the
violet
leaves
for
a
short
time
becoming
mature
and
changing
to
chrysalids
sufficiently
early
to
emerge
as
butterflies
late
in
may
in
this
hypothetical
group
we
have
a
fairly
normal
condition
of
a
butterfly
hibernating
in
the
stage
of
the
larva
and
requiring
some
weeks
for
the
development
of
the
eggs
in
the
ovaries
of
the
butterflies
in
the
case
of
the
first
two
broods
but
not
of
the
third
in
another
group
which
we
may
designate
as
b
the
conditions
may
be
similar
except
that
the
butterflies
lay
their
eggs
very
soon
after
coming
from
the
chrysalis
in
the
case
of
all
three
broods
obviously
there
would
be
a
tendency
here
for
hastening
the
earliness
of
the
broods
so
that
the
hibernating
caterpillars
might
either
become
larger
or
might
go
into
the
hibernating
condition
earlier
than
those
of
group
a
in
group
c
the
variation
takes
place
in
the
larvae
rather
than
in
the
butterflies
these
may
go
on
in
the
normal
way
up
to
the
time
the
caterpillars
of
the
summer
brood
become
half
grown
then
they
become
lethargic
ceasing
to
feed
and
to
all
appearances
going
into
hibernation
they
remain
in
this
condition
until
the
following
spring
when
they
come
forth
from
their
winter
sleep
and
feed
upon
the
violets
in
precisely
the
same
way
as
the
caterpillars
of
the
third
brood
of
groups
a
and
b
in
group
d
we
have
another
interesting
variation
of
the
larvae
these
are
the
same
as
c
up
to
the
time
of
becoming
lethargic
that
is
the
larvae
of
the
summer
or
second
brood
become
lethargic
at
the
same
time
as
those
of
group
c
but
instead
of
continuing
in
this
condition
until
the
following
spring
they
remain
in
lethargy
only
three
or
four
weeks
then
they
wake
up
having
apparently
then
changed
their
caterpillar
minds
and
begin
to
feed
soon
maturing
and
changing
to
chrysalids
from
which
butterflies
emerge
late
in
september
or
early
in
october
the
result
is
that
these
butterflies
lay
eggs
so
late
that
the
cold
nights
come
on
apace
and
the
little
caterpillars
apparently
take
no
food
at
all
but
go
into
hibernation
immediately
in
consequence
these
must
eat
for
a
longer
period
the
following
spring
so
that
the
butterflies
into
which
they
mature
will
be
likely
not
to
appear
until
well
along
in
june
it
is
probable
that
even
this
rather
elaborate
statement
does
not
do
justice
to
all
the
variations
in
the
development
of
this
little
butterfly
but
perhaps
enough
has
been
said
to
help
us
to
understand
something
of
the
way
in
which
such
insects
are
able
to
adapt
their
life
habits
to
the
conditions
of
their
environment
it
is
easy
to
see
that
if
conditions
should
so
change
as
to
give
any
one
of
these
groups
a
decided
advantage
over
the
others
the
tendency
would
be
for
the
other
groups
to
disappear
and
for
the
group
of
favored
habits
to
survive
the
meadow
fritillary
is
common
in
canada
and
the
northern
states
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
it
is
found
especially
in
lowland
meadows
and
along
the
borders
of
swamps
the
very
situations
chosen
by
the
food
plants
of
the
larva
the
blue
and
the
white
violets
the
butterflies
may
be
often
seen
sipping
nectar
from
the
various
species
of
mint
and
related
plants
found
in
such
situations
it
is
commonly
associated
with
the
fritillary
from
which
it
is
easily
distinguished
because
it
has
no
silver
spots
upon
its
wings
this
attractive
little
butterfly
bears
a
close
general
resemblance
to
the
meadow
fritillary
from
which
it
differs
chiefly
by
the
continuous
row
of
silver
spots
along
the
border
of
the
under
side
of
both
pairs
of
wings
it
is
found
in
the
same
localities
as
the
other
and
its
is
very
similar
the
present
species
is
widely
distributed
in
north
america
being
found
as
far
west
as
the
upper
mississippi
valley
and
the
rocky
mountains
and
southward
as
far
as
the
carolinas
in
new
england
and
the
atlantic
states
it
is
one
of
the
commonest
of
the
smaller
butterflies
beginning
with
the
butterflies
which
are
seen
in
the
fields
and
meadows
in
september
the
yearly
cycle
of
this
insect
may
be
summarized
in
this
way
the
eggs
laid
in
september
hatch
in
a
few
days
into
tiny
caterpillars
some
of
which
become
lethargic
at
once
while
others
begin
feeding
upon
the
violet
leaves
and
continue
thus
to
feed
until
they
are
about
half
grown
these
then
also
become
lethargic
and
find
shelter
just
above
the
soil
surface
where
they
remain
until
the
following
spring
they
then
begin
to
feed
again
upon
the
violet
leaves
and
at
about
the
same
time
the
other
caterpillars
which
became
dormant
as
soon
as
hatched
also
waken
and
feed
upon
these
leaves
naturally
those
which
were
half
grown
at
the
beginning
of
spring
are
likely
to
mature
and
change
to
chrysalids
two
or
three
weeks
earlier
than
those
which
were
so
small
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
consequently
the
fresh
butterflies
will
be
found
from
late
in
may
to
the
latter
part
of
june
presumably
those
which
first
appeared
have
developed
from
the
larger
caterpillars
and
the
later
ones
from
the
smaller
caterpillars
the
butterflies
of
this
first
brood
of
the
season
lay
their
eggs
upon
the
violet
leaves
generally
upon
the
upper
surface
of
the
blade
but
occasionally
upon
the
stems
or
upon
grasses
these
eggs
hatch
in
about
a
week
into
caterpillars
that
mature
during
the
next
three
or
four
weeks
coming
forth
as
a
second
brood
of
butterflies
late
in
july
or
early
in
august
these
in
like
manner
lay
their
eggs
and
develop
into
a
third
brood
which
matures
as
butterflies
in
september
these
lay
eggs
that
hatch
into
the
caterpillars
which
live
through
the
winter
there
are
thus
three
broods
of
butterflies
during
the
year
and
it
is
probable
that
there
is
the
same
remarkable
variation
in
the
habits
of
the
different
broods
that
have
been
found
in

some

although
more
than
fifty
distinct
species
belonging
to
this
tribe
have
been
found
in
north
america
very
few
of
these
are
distributed
through
the
eastern
part
only
four
are
so
abundant
and
widely
distributed
that
they
need
be
treated
of
here
to
the
naturalist
those
islands
in
the
seas
which
are
remote
from
the
mainland
have
long
been
of
especial
interest
the
life
upon
them
is
likely
to
show
the
results
of
many
generations
of
living
under
unique
conditions
the
plants
and
animals
are
generally
distinctive
many
of
the
species
having
characteristics
which
differentiate
them
markedly
from
those
upon
the
mainland
they
show
in
a
thousand
ways
the
effect
of
isolation
and
so
are
of
especial
value
when
one
attempts
to
determine
the
results
of
unusual
conditions
upon
living
things
in
a
somewhat
similar
way
the
peat
bogs
or
sphagnum
swamps
which
occur
here
and
there
over
a
large
part
of
north
america
are
of
especial
interest
because
in
a
way
they
are
biological
islands
in
which
the
conditions
of
a
long
past
age
are
preserved
until
the
present
these
nearly
always
occur
in
a
little
valley
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
hills
here
the
water
has
collected
originally
into
a
pond
or
lake
which
has
been
gradually
filling
up
through
the
growth
of
peat
mosses
and
a
special
set
of
other
plants
that
develop
in
such
situations
one
can
still
find
many
stages
in
the
process
in
some
bogs
the
surface
will
be
practically
covered
although
the
water
beneath
may
still
be
so
abundant
that
the
matted
moss
quakes
as
one
walks
over
it
sometimes
such
bogs
are
really
dangerous
because
the
walker
may
drop
through
to
the
water
beneath
in
most
of
the
bogs
however
the
little
lake
is
nearly
filled
but
shows
the
surface
over
a
small
area
the
conditions
in
these
peat
bogs
have
changed
little
since
civilization
began
they
are
relics
of
an
earlier
era
which
have
come
down
to
us
as
types
of
conditions
that
once
existed
very
generally
the
plant
life
is
unique
and
consists
almost
entirely
of
forms
which
are
found
practically
nowhere
else
there
are
comparatively
few
animals
living
in
these
peat
bogs
and
all
of
these
are
likely
to
be
of
especial
interest
among
the
insects
none
is
more
remarkable
than
the
baltimore
butterfly
which
has
several
peculiarities
that
differentiate
it
from
the
other
members
of
the
group
it
seems
to
have
come
down
to
us
unchanged
from
a
far
remote
past
and
to
be
living
its
tranquil
life
in
precisely
the
same
manner
as
during
the
time
when
the
mammoth
and
the
mastodon
were
likely
to
invade
its
haunts
the
baltimore
is
probably
the
most
local
in
its
distribution
of
any
of
the
butterflies
found
throughout
canada
and
the
northern
states
it
is
to
be
looked
for
only
in
peat
bogs
and
swamps
and
it
has
a
remarkable
unity
in
its
whether
it
be
found
in
northern
canada
or
as
far
south
as
west
virginia
the
butterfly
itself
is
rather
large
measuring
a
little
more
than
two
inches
across
its
expanded
wings
and
being
colored
with
an
unusual
combination
of
fulvous
and
yellow
upon
a
black
background
it
is
present
as
a
rule
only
from
about
the
first
of
june
to
the
middle
of
july
the
eggs
in
bunches
of
from
one
hundred
to
four
hundred
are
laid
upon
the
leaves
of
the
plant
commonly
called
or
they
do
not
hatch
for
nearly
three
weeks
then
the
little
caterpillars
emerge
together
and
usually
each
eats
a
little
of
the
empty
egg
shell
they
are
then
likely
to
form
a
thin
web
over
the
under
surface
of
the
leaf
beneath
which
they
remain
as
a
small
company
feeding
upon
the
succulent
green
tissue
a
little
later
they
are
likely
to
begin
the
construction
of
a
miniature
nest
by
spinning
a
silken
web
over
the
young
leaves
at
the
top
of
the
plant
from
this
time
on
this
silken
nest
serves
as
their
home
and
they
utilize
it
almost
as
effectively
as
do
our
familiar
american
tent
caterpillars
the
nest
which
they
make
in
the
forks
of
the
wild
cherry
tree
the
baltimore
caterpillars
often
wander
more
or
less
from
their
home
but
they
generally
come
back
to
feed
as
well
as
to
moult
if
the
nest
is
injured
by
wind
or
rain
all
the
caterpillars
turn
out
to
repair
it
and
as
the
need
for
new
food
supplies
arises
they
also
unite
to
enlarge
the
tent
this
habit
of
working
together
for
the
common
good
is
very
suggestive
of
the
similar
habits
of
the
american
tent
caterpillars
doors
for
going
in
and
out
are
left
in
the
tent
during
its
construction
the
tent
thus
made
is
likely
to
be
deserted
after
the
first
moult
and
a
new
and
larger
one
constructed
on
another
part
of
the
plant
two
or
perhaps
three
such
nests
may
be
made
from
the
time
the
caterpillar
hatches
until
after
the
second
moult
the
last
nest
made
is
very
likely
to
be
upon
some
neighboring
bushy
plant
or
at
least
to
include
some
branches
of
such
a
plant
if
the
bulk
of
the
nest
is
made
upon
for
after
the
third
moult
the
caterpillars
stop
feeding
and
become
more
or
less
quiet
thus
beginning
a
nine
months
fast
during
which
they
are
simply
to
wait
until
the
return
of
spring
this
fast
may
be
begun
any
time
from
the
middle
of
august
until
early
in
september
and
even
when
brought
indoors
the
caterpillars
can
not
be
induced
to
eat
it
is
evidently
the
way
in
which
the
species
has
bridged
over
the
winter
during
the
thousands
of
generations
of
its
existence
and
the
instinct
is
so
firmly
fixed
that
it
can
not
be
changed
even
in
west
virginia
where
the
caterpillars
would
have
plenty
of
time
during
the
summer
to
mature
as
butterflies
that
would
bring
forth
another
generation
of
caterpillars
that
might
pass
the
winter
the
condition
is
the
same
as
in
the
far
northern
regions
so
within
the
shelter
of
the
silken
nest
these
baltimore
caterpillars
remain
from
the
middle
of
august
until
may
then
when
the
spring
sunshine
has
sufficiently
warmed
their
cool
retreats
they
come
forth
and
feed
greedily
upon
the
young
leaves
they
now
soon
make
up
for
lost
time
and
complete
their
growth
as
caterpillars
very
quickly
when
full
fed
they
wander
about
in
all
directions
each
hunting
its
own
shelter
before
becoming
a
chrysalis
having
found
a
twig
or
branch
that
suits
their
purpose
each
hangs
downward
and
changes
to
a
brownish
yellow
chrysalis
more
or
less
marked
with
black
it
remains
in
this
condition
for
about
a
fortnight
when
it
comes
forth
as
the
baltimore
butterfly
which
thus
appears
again
about
the
first
of
june
these
butterflies
seem
to
have
some
of
the
characteristics
of
their
unique
surroundings
there
are
very
few
flowers
in
the
peat
bogs
and
it
is
significant
that
the
butterflies
instead
of
flitting
from
flower
to
flower
as
do
most
of
our
familiar
species
fly
rather
in
a
slow
and
lazy
fashion
from
leaf
to
leaf
lighting
upon
the
foliage
or
frequently
upon
the
surface
of
the
moss
or
ground
they
seem
lethargic
and
have
little
of
the
animation
which
we
usually
associate
with
the
name
butterfly
in
my
mind
the
baltimore
is
associated
with
the
white
mountain
butterfly
as
a
survivor
of
a
former
geologic
period
the
latter
was
developed
under
colder
conditions
and
now
survives
only
on
a
few
isolated
mountain
peaks
but
the
former
has
survived
wherever
the
peat
bog
has
held
its
sway
during
the
long
ages
that
the
surrounding
landscape
has
been
taking
on
its
condition
many
things
in
the
life
of
the
baltimore
point
to
its
primitive
condition
the
laying
of
the
eggs
in
loose
clusters
the
long
lethargy
of
the
caterpillars
the
limited
flight
of
the
butterflies
all
indicate
a
creature
with
habits
firmly
fixed
by
long
ages
of
development
in
a
definite
environment
no
collector
should
feel
sure
that
the
baltimore
is
not
to
be
one
of
his
trophies
until
he
has
visited
in
june
every
peat
bog
or
sphagnum
swamp
in
his
locality
one
may
search
years
without
finding
it
and
then
come
across
a
dozen
in
a
single
day
i
well
remember
the
interest
with
which
i
first
found
this
species
on
the
margin
of
a
great
swamp
in
michigan
when
i
was
eager
for
every
new
butterfly
to
add
to
my
collection
i
had
never
seen
it
alive
before
and
the
thrill
with
which
the
first
specimen
was
captured
can
be
realized
only
by
those
remembering
similar
experiences
this
little
butterfly
so
closely
resembles
the
pearl
crescent
and
the
silver
crescent
that
on
the
wing
it
is
easily
mistaken
for
them
it
really
looks
more
like
them
than
it
does
the
baltimore
which
is
considerably
larger
and
darker
colored
than
the
present
species
this
is
essentially
a
northern
form
occurring
only
in
a
narrow
strip
of
country
east
of
minnesota
and
wisconsin
running
on
the
north
through
southern
canada
and
on
the
south
through
michigan
new
york
and
massachusetts
this
insect
is
one
of
the
botanists
among
all
the
butterflies
in
the
very
difficult
group
of
asters
which
has
caused
endless
confusion
to
human
botanists
these
insects
seem
always
able
to
select
the
one
species
it
has
been
repeatedly
found
that
the
caterpillars
would
starve
rather
than
eat
the
leaves
of
other
kinds
of
asters
and
so
far
as
known
they
have
never
been
found
feeding
outdoors
upon
any
other
these
butterflies
appear
along
roadsides
and
in
open
fields
about
the
middle
of
june
they
are
often
very
abundant
and
are
much
more
generally
distributed
than
the
baltimore
a
few
weeks
later
the
females
lay
their
eggs
upon
the
aster
leaves
the
eggs
being
deposited
in
clusters
of
twenty
or
more
on
the
under
side
of
the
leaf
early
in
july
the
little
caterpillars
come
forth
and
remain
together
in
colonies
as
they
feed
upon
the
green
tissues
of
the
leaves
each
is
able
to
spin
a
silken
thread
so
that
wherever
they
go
they
weave
a
web
and
they
soon
protect
themselves
with
a
slight
silken
shelter
which
is
suggestive
of
the
nests
made
by
the
baltimore
caterpillar
they
continue
to
live
in
this
manner
for
several
weeks
in
july
and
august
growing
rather
gradually
and
becoming
approximately
half
grown
before
the
frosts
of
autumn
unlike
the
baltimore
caterpillars
they
now
desert
their
nests
and
find
shelter
at
or
near
the
surface
of
the
ground
here
they
hibernate
to
come
forth
the
following
spring
and
feed
again
upon
the
new
growth
of
the
aster
plants
often
doing
considerable
damage
by
denuding
the
young
shoots
of
their
leaves
they
become
full
grown
in
time
to
change
to
chrysalids
so
that
the
butterflies
may
emerge
in
june
silver
while
this
species
has
not
the
broad
distribution
for
which
the
pearl
crescent
is
notable
it
occurs
over
a
large
part
of
the
united
states
its
distribution
is
bounded
broadly
by
a
line
running
from
southern
canada
north
of
maine
to
a
point
in
southern
canada
north
of
montana
whence
it
runs
south
through
wyoming
and
utah
to
the
corner
of
arizona
and
thence
east
through
new
mexico
and
texas
to
ohio
and
west
virginia
extending
south
near
the
coast
to
north
carolina
it
thus
includes
a
broad
belt
of
territory
occupying
fully
one
half
of
the
area
of
the
united
states
throughout
this
vast
area
the
silver
crescent
is
often
a
purely
local
species
occurring
abundantly
during
its
brief
season
in
some
favorable
locality
but
seldom
being
seen
in
other
places
near
by
in
the
north
it
is
the
butterflies
appearing
on
the
wing
during
june
and
commonly
disappearing
early
in
july
late
in
june
the
females
lay
their
eggs
in
clusters
of
a
hundred
or
less
on
the
under
surface
of
the
leaves
of
various
composite
plants
notably
sunflowers
asters
and
a
common
species
of
actinomeris
a
week
or
more
later
these
hatch
into
little
caterpillars
that
feed
together
in
colonies
upon
the
green
tissues
of
the
leaf
taking
only
the
succulent
parenchyma
and
leaving
the
network
of
veins
as
one
leaf
is
thus
denuded
they
migrate
to
another
in
this
way
passing
from
leaf
to
leaf
for
several
weeks
in
summer
they
continue
to
feed
until
about
half
grown
when
they
desert
the
food
plant
and
find
shelter
at
the
soil
surface
here
they
become
lethargic
and
hibernate
until
the
following
spring
they
then
arouse
again
and
feed
upon
the
tender
leaves
of
the
new
growth
continuing
to
eat
and
grow
for
a
few
weeks
before
they
become
mature
as
caterpillars
and
change
to
chrysalids
a
little
later
the
chrysalids
disclose
the
butterflies
which
as
already
indicated
appear
in
june
in
more
southern
regions
the
of
the
species
is
not
so
simple
there
is
at
least
a
partial
second
brood
and
it
is
probable
that
in
many
localities
the
species
is
both
and
in
such
a
case
some
of
the
caterpillars
go
into
hibernation
probably
about
midsummer
remaining
quiescent
through
the
later
weeks
of
summer
and
all
the
weeks
of
fall
and
winter
while
others
would
mature
to
chrysalids
and
butterflies
in
summer
and
the
butterflies
would
lay
eggs
for
a
second
brood
of
larvae
which
would
hibernate
when
partially
grown
there
are
opportunities
for
careful
observers
to
do
good
work
upon
the
of
this
species
in
many
parts
of
its
range
pearl
some
years
ago
samuel
scudder
the
most
notable
student
of
new
england
butterflies
wrote
a
delightful
essay
with
the
title
butterflies
as
botanists
from
his
long
experience
in
rearing
the
eggs
of
these
insects
he
concluded
that
the
females
know
in
a
most
remarkable
way
the
precise
kinds
of
leaves
upon
which
to
oviposit
he
educed
many
illustrations
in
proof
of
the
fact
and
quoted
a
remark
of
asa
gray
the
most
eminent
of
american
botanists
that
is
worth
repeating
at
that
time
scudder
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
pearl
crescent
laid
its
eggs
exclusively
upon
the
new
england
aster
now
the
asters
as
a
group
have
been
a
source
of
much
trouble
to
the
botanists
who
have
attempted
to
classify
them
as
to
species
and
variety
the
various
forms
are
so
similar
to
one
another
that
different
authorities
have
not
agreed
as
to
the
limitations
of
the
species
so
when
gray
was
told
that
this
little
butterfly
was
able
always
to
distinguish
and
select
for
her
a
single
species
of
this
vexing
tribe
he
replied
if
your
butterfly
selects
only
that
it
is
a
better
botanist
than
most
of
us
while
later
observers
have
found
that
this
beautiful
little
insect
is
not
so
exclusive
in
its
choice
of
a
food
plant
as
was
formerly
believed
it
serves
to
illustrate
the
fact
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
caterpillars
of
this
group
have
a
very
narrow
range
of
food
plants
in
nearly
every
case
where
the
food
is
thus
restricted
the
insect
feeds
only
upon
species
which
are
closely
related
to
one
another
generally
falling
within
a
single
genus
according
to
the
classification
of
the
botanists
there
has
been
much
discussion
in
regard
to
the
way
in
which
the
mother
butterfly
knows
the
particular
species
which
she
chooses
for
oviposition
experiments
apparently
have
shown
that
she
is
not
dependent
upon
the
sense
of
sight
but
rather
upon
the
sense
of
smell
which
as
is
well
known
is
much
more
highly
developed
in
insects
than
in
the
higher
animals
i
suppose
it
is
not
very
strange
that
a
creature
which
has
fed
from
infancy
upon
leaves
with
a
certain
taste
and
odor
should
in
its
later
life
respond
only
to
that
particular
odor
and
should
neglect
all
others
in
a
way
the
butterfly
itself
is
a
product
of
the
plant
and
it
probably
is
not
necessary
to
assume
that
each
butterfly
differentiates
the
odors
of
all
kinds
of
plants
but
only
that
she
responds
to
the
fragrance
of
the
one
with
which
she
has
been
particularly
associated

this
idea
may
suggest
to
various
observers
an
interesting
point
of
view
when
you
see
a
butterfly
flying
leisurely
from
plant
to
plant
and
alighting
upon
the
leaves
rather
than
the
blossom
you
may
be
pretty
sure
that
she
is
bent
upon
now
watch
her
to
see
if
she
goes
at
once
to
the
particular
kind
of
leaves
she
finally
selects
or
does
she
stop
momentarily
upon
neighboring
plants
apparently
trying
to
find
the
one
from
which
the
fragrance
emanates
until
at
last
she
reaches
it
such
observations
have
only
rarely
been
recorded
and
if
carefully
made
notes
being
taken
on
the
spot
they
would
have
decided
scientific
value
and
few
butterflies
are
more
abundant
or
more
widely
distributed
throughout
north
america
than
the
beautiful
little
pearl
crescent
it
occurs
over
practically
the
whole
of
the
united
states
and
canada
and
is
found
from
early
in
spring
until
late
in
autumn
it
is
a
rather
small
species
with
a
wing
expanse
of
only
about
an
inch
and
a
quarter
the
upper
surface
of
the
wings
being
that
tone
of
reddish
brown
called
fulvous
more
or
less
marked
with
black
wavy
lines
and
dots
the
under
surface
is
similar
in
color
with
a
small
silver
crescent
near
the
outer
margin
of
each
hind
wing
these
butterflies
are
not
very
active
creatures
although
they
are
commonly
found
in
meadows
and
pastures
along
brooks
and
by
the
borders
of
open
woods
instead
of
laying
their
eggs
singly
as
do
so
many
of
the
more
active
butterflies
they
lay
them
in
clusters
often
of
a
hundred
or
more
one
layer
of
eggs
being
placed
above
the
other
upon
the
aster
leaf
in
at
least
one
case
observed
the
caterpillars
hatch
from
the
layer
farthest
away
from
the
leaf
surface
before
those
of
the
layer
next
the
leaf
surface
emerge
this
is
an
interesting
provision
for
were
the
latter
to
come
out
first
they
would
be
likely
to
disarrange
the
unhatched
eggs
the
caterpillars
appear
about
a
week
after
the
eggs
are
laid
and
remain
together
in
crowded
colonies
that
feed
upon
the
upper
surface
of
the
aster
leaf
at
first
they
eat
only
the
green
tissue
leaving
the
bare
veins
although
they
are
not
careful
to
denude
the
entire
surface
of
the
leaf
as
so
many
other
caterpillars
do
as
one
leaf
is
exhausted
they
pass
to
another
near
by
continuing
thus
to
feed
in
companies
for
a
few
weeks
their
general
color
is
blackish
although
the
black
is
relieved
with
yellow
dots
along
the
back
and
a
band
of
a
similar
color
on
each
side
unlike
the
larger
social
caterpillars
of
the
mourning
cloak
and
other
butterflies
these
larvae
do
not
spin
any
threads
as
they
crawl
from
place
to
place
so
there
is
absolutely
no
nest
made
upon
the
aster
leaf
this
may
possibly
be
correlated
with
the
fact
that
these
caterpillars
are
sluggish
creatures
and
when
disturbed
drop
quickly
to
the
soil
beneath
when
the
caterpillars
are
full
grown
they
fall
or
crawl
to
the
ground
and
scatter
more
or
less
in
search
of
shelter
each
attaches
itself
to
any
protection
it
may
have
found
and
changes
to
a
grayish
or
brownish
chrysalis
more
or
less
angular
it
remains
in
this
condition
for
a
period
that
varies
greatly
with
the
weather
conditions
averaging
about
two
weeks
there
are
two
distinct
forms
of
these
butterflies
which
vary
so
greatly
that
they
were
once
considered
separate
species
they
are
now
known
however
to
be
only
seasonal
variations
in
new
england
two
broods
of
the
insect
occur
one
in
spring
the
other
in
summer
the
spring
form
is
called
technically
tharos
in
this
form
the
under
surface
of
the
hind
wings
is
very
distinctly
marked
with
blackish
spots
the
summer
form
is
called
tharos
it
is
noticeably
larger
than
the
spring
form
and
it
has
very
few
markings
on
the
under
surface
of
the
hind
wings
yearly
as
it
occurs
in
new
england
the
yearly
history
of
this
little
butterfly
runs
something
like
this
the
spring
form
of
the
adult
appears
in
may
and
lays
eggs
upon
the
aster
leaves
these
eggs
hatch
into
caterpillars
that
feed
upon
the
aster
leaves
for
several
weeks
and
then
change
to
chrysalids
remaining
in
the
latter
stage
ten
days
or
two
weeks
they
then
come
from
the
chrysalids
in
the
form
of
the
summer
butterflies
which
begin
to
appear
about
the
middle
of
july
and
continue
to
emerge
for
at
least
a
month
these
lay
eggs
upon
the
aster
leaves
again
and
the
little
caterpillars
that
hatch
from
them
feed
for
a
few
weeks
or
until
about
the
last
of
september
they
are
then
only
partially
grown
but
they
make
no
attempt
to
complete
their
transformation
at
this
time
instead
they
drop
to
the
ground
and
go
into
hibernation
remaining
in
this
condition
until
early
the
following
spring
they
then
begin
feeding
again
and
complete
their
development
in
time
to
emerge
as
the
spring
form
of
the
butterfly
in
may
some
very
interesting
experiments
by
william
edwards
have
shown
that
the
smaller
darker
spring
form
of
the
butterfly
is
due
to
cold
he
placed
upon
ice
chrysalids
that
would
normally
produce
the
summer
form
and
found
that
the
specimens
so
treated
produced
the
spring
form
this
butterfly
is
one
of
the
best
known
examples
of
the
variation
in
the
yearly
cycle
due
to
differences
in
latitude
this
is
readily
shown
by
a
brief
summary
of
its
from
north
to
south
in
the
far
northern
climate
of
labrador
there
is
but
one
brood
a
year
and
the
butterflies
belong
to
what
i
have
been
calling
the
spring
form
the
butterflies
appear
on
the
wing
in
early
summer
lay
their
eggs
upon
the
aster
leaves
and
die
the
eggs
hatch
into
caterpillars
that
feed
for
several
weeks
then
become
dormant
and
remain
in
such
shelters
as
they
can
find
until
the
following
spring
they
then
change
to
chrysalids
to
emerge
as
butterflies
a
little
later
there
is
thus
but
one
brood
a
year
and
the
only
form
of
the
butterfly
is
the
small
darker
colored
variety
as
far
south
as
southern
canada
there
is
a
slight
variation
in
this
yearly
cycle
the
spring
form
of
the
butterflies
appears
in
may
and
lays
eggs
the
eggs
hatch
into
caterpillars
part
of
these
caterpillars
mature
within
a
few
weeks
change
to
chrysalids
and
come
out
in
july
or
august
as
the
larger
summer
form
of
the
butterfly
which
in
turn
lays
eggs
for
the
caterpillars
that
are
to
winter
over
in
a
dormant
condition
and
mature
the
following
season
but
the
significant
fact
is
that
not
all
of
the
caterpillars
which
thus
have
hatched
in
spring
go
through
this
cycle
part
of
them
become
dormant
when
partially
grown
and
continue
dormant
through
summer
autumn
and
winter
just
as
they
did
in
labrador
then
in
spring
they
develop
into
the
spring
form
of
the
butterfly
along
with
the
caterpillars
that
have
hatched
from
the
eggs
laid
in
summer
there
is
thus
what
is
called
an
overlapping
of
the
broods
farther
south
in
southern
new
england
the
is
more
definitely
each
year
as
already
described
in
an
earlier
paragraph
still
farther
south
in
the
region
of
the
virginias
it
is
definitely
there
being
at
least
two
summer
broods
during
the
year
how
is
it
that
the
instinct
to
become
lethargic
lies
dormant
in
the
summer
broods
of
caterpillars
and
shows
itself
only
in
the
autumn
brood
is
it
perhaps
due
to
a
reaction
to
the
colder
nights
of
the
later
season
if
so
possibly
one
could
get
interesting
light
upon
the
subject
by
experimenting
with
placing
the
summer
caterpillars
temporarily
in
an
ice
chest
of
the
or
expanse
inches
general
color
purplish
black
with
the
upper
surface
marked
thus
a
marginal
row
of
spots
between
the
veins
two
rows
of
creamy
yellow
spots
inside
of
the
row
just
mentioned
two
or
three
small
red
and
two
or
three
small
white
spots
near
front
border
of
each
front
wing
under
surface
checkered
in
and
creamy
yellow
on
a
blackish
background
or
expanse
inches
this
species
bears
a
close
general
resemblance
to
the
silver
crescent
it
may
be
distinguished
by
the
fact
that
the
middle
joint
of
each
palpus
is
of
uniform
size
from
end
to
end
instead
of
tapering
toward
its
outer
end
the
tibial
joint
of
the
first
pair
of
legs
of
the
male
butterfly
is
very
thick
the
upper
wing
surface
is
so
marked
with
black
that
the
tawny
red
coloring
shows
only
in
the
middle
or
expanse
inches
this
species
may
be
known
from
harris
by
the
fact
that
the
middle
joint
of
each
palpus
tapers
from
the
middle
to
the
tip
and
that
the
tibia
of
each
front
leg
in
the
male
is
slender
rather
than
stout
on
the
lower
surface
of
the
wings
there
is
a
narrow
yellowish
marginal
line
or
expanse
inches
general
color
much
lighter
than
either
of
the
preceding
terminal
joint
of
each
palpus
less
than
a
third
as
long
as
the
middle
joint
the
tribe
of
the
the
special
characteristic
that
distinguishes
the
members
of
this
important
group
from
the
other
nymphs
is
the
fact
that
on
that
portion
of
the
club
of
each
antenna
which
has
not
hairs
there
are
three
longitudinal
ridges
the
tribe
includes
a
large
number
of
our
most
familiar
butterflies
nearly
all
of
them
are
rather
large
with
bright
attractive
colors
they
fly
freely
along
roadsides
and
in
orchards
fields
and
meadows
so
they
are
commonly
seen
by
every
one
the
is
one
of
the
largest
of
the
as
well
as
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
all
our
species
it
has
a
wonderful
violet
iridescence
which
is
especially
marked
on
the
projecting
tip
of
the
hind
wing
on
fresh
specimens
however
it
may
be
seen
practically
all
over
both
surfaces
of
the
wings
and
in
bright
sunlight
gives
them
a
sheen
of
remarkable
beauty
the
expanded
wings
measure
nearly
two
and
a
half
inches
the
upper
surface
being
marked
with
dark
brown
upon
a
ground
of
the
under
surface
has
a
effect
in
brownish
gray
brought
about
by
rather
indefinite
markings
of
varying
tone
the
most
characteristic
feature
is
a
distinct
silver
semicolon
on
the
middle
of
the
under
surface
of
each
hind
wing
this
marking
closely
resembles
the
greek
interrogation
point
and
so
the
species
was
given
the
specific
name
by
fabricius
early
in
the
history
of
science
it
has
since
often
been
called
the
interrogation
butterfly
as
a
translation
of
its
latin
name
but
in
as
much
as
the
marking
on
the
wings
is
not
at
all
like
the
english
interrogation
point
this
has
led
to
considerable
confusion
and
people
have
considered
it
a
misnomer
it
has
also
been
called
the
semicolon
butterfly
which
is
correct
enough
so
far
as
this
most
characteristic
feature
is
concerned
but
it
leads
to
confusion
in
connection
with
the
latin
name
the
recent
practice
seems
the
better
which
is
to
call
it
the
butterfly
the
of
this
butterfly
is
much
like
that
of
the
related
species
briefly
summarized
this
is
its
story
the
adult
butterflies
more
or
less
worn
and
faded
from
their
long
hibernation
appear
in
fields
and
pastures
in
may
they
fly
for
several
weeks
sipping
nectar
from
many
kinds
of
spring
flowers
the
females
search
for
the
leaves
of
the
elm
hop
nettle
false
nettle
and
perhaps
other
related
plants
on
which
they
deposit
their
ribbed
eggs
either
singly
or
in
small
groups
it
often
happening
that
one
egg
will
be
laid
directly
on
top
of
another
about
a
week
later
the
eggs
hatch
into
small
spinose
caterpillars
which
begin
feeding
upon
the
leaves
near
by
they
continue
to
feed
and
grow
rather
rapidly
until
they
become
full
size
each
then
fastens
a
bit
of
pink
silk
to
the
stem
of
the
plant
or
some
other
support
in
which
it
entangles
its
hind
legs
and
hangs
downward
to
become
a
chrysalis
which
is
remarkable
for
its
numerous
protuberances
and
the
beautiful
silvery
and
golden
spots
along
the
middle
of
the
back
within
these
chrysalids
the
change
from
larva
to
butterfly
takes
place
usually
in
less
than
two
weeks
so
that
this
new
brood
of
adults
appears
on
the
wing
early
in
july
eggs
are
laid
by
these
for
a
second
brood
of
caterpillars
that
feed
upon
the
host
plants
in
the
same
way
as
the
others
and
mature
as
butterflies
late
in
august
or
early
in
september
these
butterflies
visit
the
fall
flowers
and
suck
the
juices
of
fallen
fruits
until
the
cold
weather
of
autumn
warns
them
to
seek
shelter
for
the
winter
they
now
find
crevices
within
the
bark
of
trees
or
places
in
hollow
logs
or
stone
piles
or
other
similar
situations
where
they
close
their
wings
together
so
that
only
the
under
surface
shows
and
remain
quiet
for
long
periods
they
hibernate
in
this
way
coming
forth
again
the
following
season
to
start
the
cycle
for
the
new
year
in
regions
where
hops
are
grown
commercially
the
chrysalids
of
these
butterflies
are
often
called
hop
merchants
there
is
a
quaint
fancy
that
the
price
of
the
crop
varies
with
the
lustre
of
the
golden
spots
upon
the
chrysalids
when
these
stand
out
conspicuously
according
to
this
fancy
the
hops
are
to
sell
high
bringing
much
gold
to
the
owners
when
these
are
inconspicuous
the
hops
are
to
sell
at
a
low
price
with
a
corresponding
diminution
in
the
returns
but
this
fancy
does
not
apply
at
all
to
the
chrysalids
when
they
are
nearly
ready
to
disclose
the
butterfly
for
at
this
time
they
lose
their
metallic
lustre
hop
merchant
or
there
are
two
species
of
butterflies
which
commonly
lay
their
eggs
upon
the
hop
and
which
resemble
each
other
so
closely
in
their
earlier
stages
that
they
are
frequently
confused
by
ordinary
observers
one
is
the
or
semicolon
and
the
other
is
the
one
which
has
long
been
called
the
comma
the
chrysalids
of
both
are
marked
in
silver
and
gold
and
the
variation
in
the
golden
lustre
has
led
hop
growers
to
deduce
from
them
the
probable
price
of
hops
on
this
account
the
chrysalids
are
commonly
called
hop
merchants
and
the
name
has
been
transferred
to
the
butterflies
themselves
plate
page
the
comma
is
easily
distinguished
by
the
conspicuous
silver
mark
in
the
middle
of
the
under
side
of
each
hind
wing
this
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
a
comma
hence
the
name
the
butterflies
are
somewhat
smaller
than
the
and
show
to
a
remarkable
degree
the
angularity
in
the
borders
of
the
wings
the
under
side
is
cleverly
marked
in
imitation
of
the
bark
of
trees
which
is
doubtless
of
much
benefit
to
the
species
in
eluding
observation
during
the
long
months
from
october
until
april
when
the
butterflies
are
hibernating
in
such
concealed
shelter
as
each
happens
to
find
the
crevices
beneath
loose
bark
the
openings
in
fallen
logs
and
hollow
trees
the
interspaces
in
stone
piles
as
well
as
the
interior
of
buildings
all
serve
this
purpose
like
the
other
butterflies
the
specimens
that
come
forth
in
spring
are
commonly
faded
and
more
or
less
frayed
from
their
long
wait
since
bursting
forth
from
the
chrysalis
they
may
often
be
seen
sunning
themselves
on
bright
days
in
april
and
may
resting
upon
stones
or
logs
in
sheltered
spots
with
their
wings
fully
expanded
to
receive
the
greatest
benefit
from
the
rays
of
sunshine
illustration
eggs
laid
in
clusters
on
the
under
side
of

magnified
from
holland
when
spring
has
sufficiently
advanced
for
the
leaves
of
the
elm
and
the
hop
to
be
fairly
well
developed
the
mother
butterflies
lay
their
eggs
in
a
curious
and
characteristic
fashion
under
a
lens
these
eggs
look
like
tiny
barrels
with
vertical
ribs
they
are
deposited
in
columns
the
egg
first
extruded
being
attached
to
the
leaf
generally
the
under
surface
and
those
which
follow
are
placed
one
upon
the
other
sometimes
to
the
number
of
six
or
eight
the
group
thus
making
a
miniature
column
now
if
the
egg
which
was
first
laid
should
hatch
before
the
others
when
the
little
caterpillar
came
out
it
would
be
very
likely
to
cause
the
others
to
fall
off
and
when
they
hatched
they
would
find
themselves
in
what
would
be
to
them
an
impenetrable
forest
of
weeds
and
grasses
from
which
there
would
be
small
chance
to
escape
to
reach
the
elm
or
hop
leaves
to
avoid
this
calamity
we
find
an
interesting
adaptation
the
egg
at
the
end
of
the
column
hatches
first
although
it
was
necessarily
the
one
laid
last
the
tiny
caterpillar
eats
its
way
out
of
the
shell
and
crawls
over
the
other
eggs
to
the
leaf
then
the
others
hatch
in
succession
the
eggs
thus
deposited
by
the
hibernating
butterflies
are
likely
to
be
laid
late
in
may
or
even
early
in
june
they
hatch
into
caterpillars
less
than
a
week
later
and
these
caterpillars
feed
for
about
a
month
when
they
change
to
the
characteristic
chrysalids
in
which
they
commonly
remain
for
a
week
or
ten
days
they
then
emerge
as
the
summer
brood
of
butterflies
most
of
them
in
new
england
appearing
during
july
these
remain
upon
the
wing
for
several
weeks
the
females
laying
their
eggs
upon
the
elm
and
hop
leaves
these
in
turn
soon
hatch
into
caterpillars
that
change
to
chrysalids
in
august
and
emerge
as
butterflies
late
that
month
or
during
september
this
autumn
brood
of
butterflies
is
quite
abundant
for
a
time
but
soon
seeks
the
seclusion
of
winter
quarters
to
remain
until
the
following
april
there
are
thus
two
distinct
broods
during
the
year
in
the
northern
states
while
as
far
south
as
west
virginia
there
are
likely
to
be
three
broods
these
caterpillars
at
first
simply
eat
small
holes
in
the
green
substance
of
the
leaf
but
as
they
become
larger
each
takes
up
its
abode
on
the
under
surface
of
a
single
leaf
and
makes
a
sheltered
tent
in
somewhat
the
same
fashion
that
the
painted
lady
does
upon
the
nettle
leaf
the
caterpillar
eats
out
more
or
less
of
the
base
of
the
blade
on
each
side
of
the
midrib
thus
weakening
the
edges
so
that
they
can
be
fastened
in
a
manner
by
silken
threads
this
serves
as
a
resting
place
from
which
it
sallies
forth
to
feed
commonly
only
toward
the
tip
of
the
leaf
as
a
result
it
often
eats
itself
out
of
house
and
home
and
has
to
crawl
to
another
leaf
and
construct
a
new
shelter
while
the
comma
is
generally
spoken
of
as
a
characteristic
northern
species
it
has
a
very
wide
range
being
found
from
new
england
to
texas
and
from
the
northwestern
states
to
the
carolinas
it
is
one
of
those
species
which
have
two
distinct
forms
of
coloring
the
winter
form
has
been
given
the
variety
name
the
butterflies
of
this
brood
are
decidedly
lighter
in
color
than
those
of
the
summer
brood
to
which
the
variety
name
has
been
given
the
latter
was
originally
described
as
a
distinct
species
by
edwards
change
to
the
the
manner
in
which
a
larva
changes
to
a
chrysalis
is
second
in
interest
only
to
that
in
which
a
chrysalis
changes
to
a
butterfly
there
are
not
a
great
many
careful
descriptions
by
competent
observers
of
this
process
in
print
one
of
the
best
of
these
is
that
by
edwards
in
his
splendid
work
on
the
butterflies
of
north
america
in
which
he
describes
the
transformation
of
the
comma
caterpillar
it
is
as
follows
when
about
to
transform
the
caterpillar
selects
a
convenient
place
on
the
under
side
of
a
projecting
rock
or
of
a
fence
rail
or
of
a
weather
board
of
the
house
or
the
midrib
of
a
hop
leaf
and
having
spun
a
little
button
of
pale
red
silk
fixes
the
hooks
of
its
hind
legs
therein
and
hangs
suspended
head
downward
in
the
shape
of
a
fishhook
and
remains
immovable
for
the
space
of
hours
no
change
being
perceptible
except
in
the
color
of
the
skin
which
becomes
partly
transparent
and
loses
its
dark
color
owing
to
its
gradual
parting
from
the
chrysalis
within
suddenly
and
to
a
without
any
premonitory
symptom
a
rent
takes
place
in
the
skin
at
the
back
of
the
head
just
wide
enough
to
allow
the
passage
of
the
chrysalis
the
head
of
which
at
once
emerges
by
a
rapid
contraction
and
expansion
of
the
folds
of
the
abdomen
the
larva
draws
the
skin
upward
successively
discovering
the
parts
of
the
fully
formed
chrysalid
until
at
last
and
in
scarcely
more
than
one
minute
of
time
the
entire
skin
is
gathered
about
the
hind
feet
it
now
bends
itself
violently
to
disengage
the
end
of
the
chrysalis
which
is
long
pointed
and
hard
furnished
with
several
little
hooks
meanwhile
retaining
its
hold
of
the
skin
by
the
folds
of
its
abdomen
until
after
a
severe
effort
convulsively
reaching
out
and
feeling
in
all
directions
for
the
object
of
its
search
it
touches
the
button
of
silk
and
at
once
grasps
it
with
its
hooks
and
fixes
them
in
it
securely
then
by
a
twisting
motion
it
manages
to
disengage
the
loose
skin
which
falls
to
the
ground
and
the
chrysalis
rests
the
whole
process
is
most
interesting
to
witness
and
excites
renewed
wonder
with
every
repetition
at
the
ingenuity
of
the
means
employed
and
the
delicacy
of
the
instinct
displayed
how
to
strip
off
the
skin
and
much
more
the
legs
by
which
the
creature
is
suspended
without
losing
its
hold
and
at
the
same
time
to
securely
fasten
the
chrysalis
is
a
problem
that
would
seem
impossible
to
solve
and
yet
this
little
insect
accomplishes
it
unerringly
when
to
fail
would
be
certain
destruction
and
not
this
species
only
but
the
larvae
of
all
butterflies
which
form
suspended
chrysalids
embracing
the
whole
of
the
great
family
of
nymphalidae
that
is
a
large
proportion
of
all
the
existing
species
of
butterflies
undergo
a
similar
transformation
the
chrysalis
is
now
green
in
color
soft
and
indefensible
susceptible
to
the
slightest
injury
and
for
a
few
moments
the
several
parts
of
the
future
butterfly
may
be
seen
and
readily
separated
the
wings
folded
close
and
enveloping
the
thorax
the
antennae
and
proboscis
stretched
at
length
along
the
back
but
very
speedily
a
complete
casing
is
formed
by
the
exuding
from
parts
of
the
body
of
a
viscous
fluid
which
binds
together
the
tender
parts
and
covers
the
whole
with
a
coating
like
varnish
this
soon
hardens
and
the
chrysalis
is
ready
to
take
its
chance
against
injury
gray
this
butterfly
is
rather
darker
colored
especially
on
its
under
side
than
the
one
last
discussed
the
silver
marking
takes
on
a
little
more
definitely
the
form
of
an
l
than
a
comma
and
the
under
surface
of
the
wings
is
darkened
by
many
blackish
threadlike
lines
running
across
the
veins
when
at
rest
with
wings
closed
these
butterflies
are
very
easily
overlooked
except
for
a
difference
in
the
food
plants
of
the
caterpillar
the
of
the
gray
comma
is
very
similar
to
that
of
the
other
comma
the
butterflies
hibernate
and
in
spring
lay
eggs
singly
on
the
leaves
of
currants
gooseberries
and
related
plants
the
eggs
soon
hatch
into
caterpillars
that
feed
upon
these
leaves
but
do
not
make
any
suggestion
of
a
nest
they
grow
slowly
and
change
into
angular
chrysalids
which
disclose
the
summer
brood
of
butterflies
in
july
these
lay
eggs
for
another
brood
of
caterpillars
which
mature
into
butterflies
in
august
and
september
these
generally
go
into
hibernation
before
the
middle
of
october
sometimes
choosing
simply
the
under
side
of
a
branch
where
their
dark
coloring
so
near
like
that
of
the
bark
is
likely
to
cause
them
to
be
overlooked
by
their
numerous
enemies
green
the
exhibit
interesting
variations
in
the
geographical
distribution
of
the
species
some
are
characteristic
members
of
the
canadian
fauna
others
of
the
alleghanian
fauna
some
of
those
which
are
characteristic
of
the
former
are
scattered
south
well
into
the
latter
but
the
green
comma
is
distinctively
a
northern
species
being
found
abundantly
in
the
great
regions
traversed
by
the
trappers
of
the
hudson
bay
company
and
occurring
south
as
far
as
northern
new
england
being
very
rare
as
far
south
as
northern
massachusetts
it
is
abundant
on
the
higher
slopes
of
the
white
mountains
as
one
might
expect
from
the
short
seasons
of
the
far
northern
regions
in
which
this
butterfly
lives
there
is
only
one
brood
each
year
in
consequence
the
adult
butterflies
live
a
long
time
coming
from
the
chrysalis
generally
the
first
weeks
in
august
they
remain
upon
the
wing
a
month
or
more
before
they
go
into
hibernation
they
come
from
their
winter
quarters
in
may
and
commonly
continue
alive
until
late
in
june
thus
it
is
evident
that
many
of
these
butterflies
must
live
at
least
ten
months
as
adults
an
extraordinary
longevity
for
one
of
these
frail
creatures
the
caterpillars
are
known
to
feed
upon
the
foliage
of
several
kinds
of
plants
these
include
alder
currant
gooseberry
willow
and
black
birch
the
last
two
named
apparently
being
those
most
often
chosen
scudder
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
these
butterflies
are
able
to
make
a
slight
clicking
noise
as
they
start
into
flight
he
described
his
experience
in
these
words
starting
up
a
pair
just
at
my
feet
on
the
mt
washington
carriage
road
one
day
i
stopped
abruptly
to
see
whether
they
would
settle
again
after
flying
a
few
yards
away
to
escape
the
cause
of
their
disturbance
one
turned
back
and
dashed
straight
at
my
face
turning
only
when
within
three
or
four
inches
of
my
nose
and
then
suddenly
whisked
off
with
a
distinct
click
as
it
did
so
snapping
its
fingers
as
it
were
in
my
very
face
there
was
no
sort
of
doubt
about
this
click
though
if
it
had
not
been
made
so
close
at
hand
it
would
probably
not
have
been
heard
but
other
butterflies
in
the
tropics
have
long
been
known
to
emit
sounds
like
this
which
can
be
heard
at
a
considerable
distance
others
including
some
of
our
own
butterflies
are
known
to
produce
a
rustling
sound
by
the
rubbing
of
one
wing
upon
another
and
movements
of
one
sort
and
another
have
been
so
often
observed
as
of
the
opposite
rubbing
of
the
erect
wings
in
most
lycaenids
and
the
tremulous
agitation
of
the
wings
in
many
different
sorts
when
excited
as
to
leave
little
doubt
that
sounds
made
by
themselves
and
for
the
advantage
of
warning
their
brethren
play
a
not
unimportant
part
in
the
lives
of
butterflies

red
admiral
or
nettle
among
the
weedy
plants
which
have
been
intimately
associated
with
mankind
ever
since
his
slow
upward
progress
in
civilization
began
the
nettle
has
probably
played
almost
as
important
a
part
as
the
thistle
while
it
lacks
the
winged
seeds
of
the
latter
it
is
even
more
effectually
protected
from
the
attacks
of
vertebrate
enemies
on
account
of
its
irritating
hairs
at
any
rate
nettles
of
various
kind
are
widely
distributed
over
the
earth
surface
and
consequently
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
nettle
butterfly
or
red
admiral
should
be
almost
as
cosmopolitan
as
the
thistle
butterfly
the
two
species
are
closely
related
in
structure
and
habits
and
the
of
the
one
is
very
similar
to
that
of
the
other
about
the
middle
of
may
one
may
see
in
open
fields
and
along
sunny
highways
these
red
admirals
flitting
from
flower
to
flower
or
stopping
occasionally
upon
green
leaves
in
search
of
opportunities
to
lay
their
eggs
should
you
observe
them
closely
you
might
notice
that
some
of
them
seemed
frayed
and
worn
while
others
seemed
perfectly
bright
and
fresh
late
in
may
and
early
in
june
these
butterflies
deposit
their
eggs
upon
the
leaves
of
the
nettles
as
a
rule
only
one
or
a
few
eggs
are
laid
on
a
leaf
but
when
the
butterflies
are
abundant
many
leaves
upon
the
plant
may
become
infested
about
a
week
later
the
egg
hatches
into
a
larva
which
is
likely
to
eat
more
or
less
of
the
empty
shell
before
crawling
up
the
stem
of
the
plant
to
the
unfolding
buds
at
the
top
here
it
makes
its
first
nest
by
webbing
together
the
still
closed
upper
surface
of
a
leaf
not
yet
unfolded
it
is
thus
able
to
furnish
itself
with
protection
from
weather
and
enemies
as
well
as
an
abundant
supply
of
succulent
food
it
remains
in
this
first
home
about
a
week
then
it
casts
its
skin
still
within
its
protection
and
stays
until
it
has
recovered
after
the
process
it
now
migrates
to
another
larger
expanded
leaf
where
it
very
cleverly
proceeds
to
construct
its
second
nest
in
order
to
do
this
it
weakens
the
midrib
at
the
base
of
the
leaf
by
biting
nearly
through
it
then
it
cuts
a
hole
in
the
blade
of
the
leaf
at
the
base
in
such
a
way
that
the
margins
are
made
to
droop
so
that
they
can
be
fastened
together
with
silk
to
form
a
little
tent
we
thus
have
a
nest
hanging
down
from
the
stem
of
the
leaf
on
the
under
side
of
which
the
caterpillar
will
find
shelter
while
near
at
hand
is
the
green
tissue
of
the
inner
surface
of
the
leaf
waiting
to
be
eaten
this
improvised
tent
serves
as
the
home
during
this
second
stage
of
the
caterpillar
here
also
the
second
moult
commonly
takes
place
after
which
the
caterpillar
migrates
to
a
new
leaf
and
constructs
its
third
nest
the
rest
of
the
story
of
the
caterpillar
life
consists
of
similar
chapters
after
each
moult
a
new
tent
is
formed
and
even
the
chrysalis
is
often
hung
within
the
last
one
the
eggs
which
were
laid
late
in
may
develop
into
butterflies
during
july
these
in
turn
lay
eggs
for
the
second
brood
of
caterpillars
most
of
which
develop
into
butterflies
late
in
august
or
early
in
september
but
some
of
which
apparently
remain
in
the
chrysalis
stage
unchanged
throughout
the
winter
and
mature
as
butterflies
about
the
middle
of
the
following
may
this
is
the
explanation
of
the
fact
mentioned
at
the
beginning
of
this
discussion
that
one
can
find
late
in
spring
and
early
in
summer
some
butterflies
which
seem
worn
and
frayed
while
others
seem
perfectly
fresh
they
are
all
the
progeny
of
the
midsummer
brood
of
the
previous
summer
but
some
of
them
have
been
living
as
butterflies
through
eight
long
months
of
tempestuous
weather
while
others
have
just
been
disclosed
from
the
protecting
walls
of
the
chrysalis
the
distribution
of
this
butterfly
is
shown
in
the
statement
that
it
occurs
throughout
europe
and
in
north
america
from
newfoundland
to
cuba
and
guatemala
it
is
a
safe
guess
that
it
is
found
in
practically
all
localities
where
nettles
grow
it
is
not
alone
the
association
between
a
butterfly
caterpillar
and
its
host
plant
which
has
been
brought
about
during
the
long
ages
through
which
one
generation
has
been
succeeding
another
but
there
have
been
also
many
developments
of
similar
associations
between
the
caterpillars
and
their
parasitic
enemies
the
red
admiral
is
a
good
example
of
such
a
development
during
its
long
growth
as
a
species
it
has
been
exposed
to
attack
by
vast
numbers
of
tiny
foes
which
live
at
the
expense
of
other
insects
several
of
these
foes
have
found
in
the
bodies
of
the
caterpillars
good
opportunities
for
growth
so
that
now
the
red
admiral
as
a
species
has
to
reckon
with
many
enemies
among
these
tiny
parasites
the
interaction
between
caterpillar
host
and
uninvited
parasitic
guest
has
much
to
do
with
the
great
irregularity
in
the
numbers
of
the
butterflies
it
is
simply
another
example
of
that
complicated
struggle
for
existence
by
means
of
which
nature
keeps
ever
a
fairly
even
balance
of
her
myriad
forces
painted
one
of
the
most
interesting
phases
of
the
study
of
butterflies
is
to
learn
how
often
they
take
advantage
in
their
of
any
peculiarity
of
the
food
plant
which
has
a
protective
value
the
painted
beauty
is
an
excellent
illustration
of
this
the
caterpillar
feeds
upon
the
leaves
of
the
common
everlasting
or
gnaphalium
this
is
an
abundant
and
widely
distributed
plant
found
along
roadsides
and
in
fields
and
pastures
it
is
notable
for
the
woolly
covering
on
stems
leaves
and
flowers
this
dry
hairy
surface
being
so
evident
that
the
flowers
will
apparently
continue
in
blossom
when
they
have
dried
hence
its
common
name
everlasting
or
as
the
french
call
a
similar
flower
immortelle
plate
page
the
utilization
of
the
hairs
upon
the
leaves
is
begun
by
the
mother
butterfly
when
she
lays
her
egg
upon
the
upper
surface
pushing
it
down
among
the
hairs
so
that
it
is
almost
concealed
should
you
be
fortunate
enough
to
find
one
of
these
eggs
you
would
see
that
it
is
a
small
yellowish
green
object
looking
like
a
tiny
barrel
with
several
vertical
ribs
upon
its
surface
a
few
days
after
the
egg
is
laid
it
hatches
into
a
minute
caterpillar
that
begins
eating
off
the
hairs
where
they
are
attached
to
the
leaf
in
such
a
way
that
it
soon
has
a
free
space
beneath
a
bunch
of
these
hairs
which
it
has
more
or
less
matted
together
by
means
of
silken
thread
the
little
caterpillar
has
thus
provided
for
itself
a
protecting
nest
that
effectually
conceals
it
from
birds
or
other
enemies
it
now
begins
feeding
upon
the
succulent
surface
of
the
rather
thick
leaf
where
it
has
removed
the
hairs
after
several
days
of
such
feeding
it
moults
still
under
the
shelter
of
its
hairy
covering
this
process
of
moulting
and
feeding
continues
for
two
or
three
weeks
the
caterpillar
occasionally
making
a
new
covering
as
needed
for
its
food
supply
the
later
nests
are
likely
to
be
made
by
folding
two
or
three
leaves
together
binding
them
with
silken
thread
the
caterpillar
in
doing
this
takes
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
terminal
leaves
are
vertical
before
they
have
spread
out
so
that
it
is
a
comparatively
simple
matter
to
make
a
little
house
by
binding
their
edges
together
with
silken
threads
the
larva
feeds
upon
the
inner
walls
of
the
house
it
thus
constructs
and
as
it
becomes
larger
the
buds
and
blossoms
are
also
utilized
for
food
when
the
caterpillar
is
full
grown
it
thus
finds
itself
fairly
well
concealed
within
a
very
substantial
sort
of
a
home
many
of
them
have
the
apparent
good
sense
to
realize
that
this
is
as
safe
a
place
as
they
are
likely
to
find
for
shelter
during
the
period
of
the
chrysalis
so
the
caterpillar
makes
the
nest
especially
secure
near
the
centre
of
what
might
be
called
the
ceiling
and
in
this
web
it
entangles
its
hind
legs
and
hangs
downward
preparatory
to
changing
to
the
chrysalis
a
few
hours
later
the
skin
splits
apart
and
is
wriggled
off
leaving
the
chrysalis
hanging
in
place
of
the
caterpillar
about
a
fortnight
later
the
butterfly
emerges
and
crawls
at
once
to
the
outside
of
the
nest
where
it
rests
quietly
while
its
wings
expand
and
its
tissues
harden
then
it
flies
away
in
search
of
the
nectar
of
thistles
and
many
other
flowers
which
it
visits
freely
this
painted
beauty
is
a
wonderful
example
of
harmonious
coloring
the
general
tone
of
the
upper
surface
of
the
wings
is
fulvous
with
some
distinct
white
markings
on
a
blackish
background
at
the
outer
angles
of
the
front
pair
there
is
also
more
or
less
blackish
shading
on
the
base
and
margin
of
all
the
wings
with
an
indistinct
row
of
about
four
dots
more
or
less
run
together
near
the
margin
of
the
hind
wing
the
under
surface
of
the
wings
is
even
more
beautiful
than
the
upper
and
furnishes
a
striking
example
of
there
is
a
little
fulvous
background
near
the
middle
of
the
front
wings
but
the
rest
of
the
surface
is
spotted
and
striped
with
blotches
and
circles
of
gray
and
brown
in
a
most
intricate
design
on
each
front
wing
near
the
outer
angle
are
three
indistinct
in
a
row
and
on
the
outer
half
of
each
hind
wing
there
are
two
circles
one
smaller
than
the
other
which
form
the
most
conspicuous
feature
in
the
marking
of
the
insect
when
full
grown
the
caterpillars
are
a
little
more
than
an
inch
long
with
a
general
color
of
velvety
black
marked
with
fine
yellow
lines
and
more
or
less
covered
with
bristly
spines
there
is
also
a
distinct
row
of
whitish
spots
along
each
side
beginning
a
short
distance
back
of
the
head
this
is
a
widely
distributed
butterfly
occurring
from
canada
to
the
southern
states
and
beyond
in
most
northern
regions
it
seems
to
be
the
butterflies
commonly
hibernating
as
adults
but
sometimes
the
winter
is
passed
in
the
condition
of
the
chrysalis
along
its
southern
range
there
are
three
and
perhaps
four
broods
each
year
painted
lady
or
the
our
story
of
this
beautiful
butterfly
ought
really
to
begin
with
that
of
one
of
the
most
successful
plants
in
the
world
now
a
plant
is
successful
from
its
own
point
of
view
when
it
is
able
to
multiply
abundantly
in
many
different
sorts
of
situations
and
to
spread
easily
over
a
large
area
the
plant
i
have
in
mind
is
the
thistle
which
from
time
immemorial
has
been
one
of
the
commonest
neighbors
of
man
it
is
found
over
the
whole
habitable
globe
as
well
as
in
many
parts
which
are
scarcely
habitable
it
has
many
advantages
in
its
struggle
for
life
the
roots
penetrate
deeply
into
the
soil
the
thickened
spiny
leaves
are
so
protected
by
their
juices
and
their
spines
that
they
are
molested
by
very
few
enemies
the
flower
stalks
are
also
clothed
in
a
similar
armature
and
the
great
heads
of
flowers
are
surrounded
with
prickly
involucres
that
generally
prevent
their
being
eaten
by
browsing
animals
or
even
by
phytophagous
insects
the
brightly
colored
blossoms
are
abundantly
provided
with
nectar
and
pollen
and
they
attract
great
numbers
of
bees
moths
and
butterflies
in
order
to
bring
about
but
all
of
these
advantages
are
of
little
significance
so
far
as
wide
distribution
is
concerned
compared
with
the
feathery
seeds
which
are
produced
in
such
abundance
and
so
generally
scattered
by
the
slightest
breath
of
wind
that
the
word
has
come
into
general
use
to
express
a
lightly
moving
object
these
airy
seeds
have
been
riding
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
all
over
the
surface
of
the
earth
for
untold
millions
of
years
doubtless
during
severe
storms
they
may
be
carried
thousands
of
miles
and
it
is
easy
to
think
that
one
of
them
might
readily
go
round
the
world
before
it
found
a
resting
place
wherever
such
a
seed
alighted
and
found
the
condition
of
a
moist
soil
and
slight
protection
it
would
be
likely
soon
to
spring
into
growth
and
to
start
anew
the
development
of
its
ancient
race
the
thistle
however
has
not
been
entirely
unmolested
during
its
aeons
of
existence
there
has
been
developing
along
with
it
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
our
butterflies
which
has
received
various
scientific
names
and
the
common
name
of
the
painted
lady
although
it
is
also
often
called
the
thistle
butterfly
and
the
cosmopolite
which
latter
title
perhaps
is
to
be
preferred
this
butterfly
however
can
scarcely
be
considered
a
troublesome
enemy
of
its
host
plant
for
it
is
seldom
sufficiently
abundant
to
injure
the
thistle
appreciably
the
relation
between
the
two
is
rather
suggestive
of
that
mutual
toleration
by
which
two
living
things
develop
together
with
advantage
at
least
to
one
and
without
serious
disadvantage
to
the
other
the
universal
distribution
of
the
food
plant
has
led
to
a
like
distribution
of
the
butterfly
consequently
the
thistle
butterfly
has
long
been
recognized
as
the
most
cosmopolitan
species
of
its
group
plate
page
aside
from
the
wide
distribution
of
its
food
plant
and
possibly
correlated
with
it
through
the
diversity
of
climatic
conditions
under
which
the
insect
has
developed
this
butterfly
is
remarkable
for
its
powers
of
flight
many
instances
are
known
where
it
has
been
taken
at
sea
long
distances
from
land
this
is
due
not
only
to
the
propensity
of
the
individual
for
taking
aërial
journeys
but
also
to
the
fact
that
this
is
one
of
the
butterflies
which
has
the
instinct
to
congregate
in
swarms
and
to
migrate
long
distances
when
thus
congregated
in
such
a
flock
started
from
africa
and
migrated
to
europe
one
of
the
most
remarkable
things
about
this
butterfly
is
our
ignorance
of
what
it
does
with
itself
in
winter
american
entomologists
are
agreed
that
the
adult
butterfly
hibernates
but
where
it
does
so
seems
not
to
be
known
here
is
an
excellent
opportunity
for
some
young
naturalist
to
go
scouting
hunting
in
board
piles
under
loose
bark
or
with
a
flashlight
searching
the
interiors
of
hollow
trees
to
find
between
november
and
april
living
specimens
of
this
butterfly
such
a
discovery
would
be
a
real
service
to
science
and
should
at
once
be
made
known
through
some
scientific
journal
in
europe
there
seems
to
be
a
belief
that
the
insect
hibernates
partially
at
least
in
the
condition
of
the
chrysalis
while
we
may
not
know
just
where
the
butterflies
have
been
throughout
the
winter
we
do
know
that
in
southern
new
england
they
begin
to
be
seen
in
fields
and
along
roadsides
about
the
middle
of
may
many
of
the
specimens
then
have
a
ragged
appearance
which
is
a
pretty
good
indication
that
they
came
from
the
chrysalis
the
fall
before
and
have
been
lying
concealed
through
all
the
weeks
since
these
butterflies
lay
their
small
greenish
eggs
on
the
leaves
of
the
thistle
the
mother
butterfly
chooses
the
location
rather
carefully
and
deposits
only
one
egg
upon
a
leaf
the
butterflies
continue
thus
to
visit
flowers
and
to
lay
eggs
until
about
the
middle
of
june
when
apparently
they
perish
about
a
week
after
the
egg
has
thus
been
laid
it
hatches
into
a
small
spiny
caterpillar
which
does
not
take
the
trouble
to
devour
its
egg
shell
as
so
many
other
caterpillars
do
instead
it
crawls
around
to
the
lower
side
of
the
leaf
and
gnaws
off
enough
of
the
silken
surface
of
the
leaf
to
furnish
material
for
making
a
webby
covering
the
leaf
particles
being
woven
together
by
threads
from
the
mouth
in
this
way
the
little
creature
soon
provides
itself
with
a
snug
enclosure
which
serves
it
as
a
temporary
home
it
remains
in
this
home
much
of
the
time
when
not
eating
going
out
occasionally
to
feed
upon
the
green
tissues
of
the
adjacent
parts
of
the
leaf
this
first
home
of
the
young
caterpillar
made
as
it
is
as
a
flat
blanket
upon
a
flat
surface
can
be
used
only
by
a
very
small
larva
consequently
the
caterpillar
soon
finds
these
quarters
too
cramped
and
it
deserts
them
to
make
a
new
home
with
larger
space
this
second
nest
is
commonly
made
on
the
upper
surface
of
a
leaf
the
edges
of
which
are
likely
to
be
more
or
less
drawn
together
and
other
supports
connected
from
other
leaves
or
a
stem
the
caterpillar
continues
to
use
this
nest
number
two
as
a
place
for
remaining
when
not
feeding
and
for
protection
during
the
process
of
moulting
but
even
this
larger
nest
is
likely
to
be
given
up
about
the
time
the
caterpillar
becomes
half
grown
and
a
third
nest
is
begun
in
the
upper
part
of
the
plant
this
is
likely
to
be
very
commodious
its
walls
being
made
of
leaves
or
stems
bound
together
by
a
silken
web
within
this
the
caterpillar
completes
its
growth
going
out
and
in
through
one
or
more
doors
when
it
wishes
to
feed
sometimes
it
even
remains
within
this
nest
during
the
process
of
changing
to
the
chrysalis
hanging
downward
from
the
upper
part
in
much
the
same
way
that
the
caterpillar
of
the
painted
beauty
butterfly
does
in
case
it
leaves
the
nest
when
fully
developed
it
generally
finds
a
place
in
which
to
pupate
about
ten
days
after
the
caterpillar
has
changed
to
a
chrysalis
it
changes
again
to
the
adult
butterfly
in
southern
new
england
these
butterflies
appear
about
the
middle
of
july
and
lay
eggs
soon
afterward
these
eggs
hatching
into
butterflies
that
change
to
chrysalids
and
change
again
to
butterflies
late
in
august
or
early
in
september
this
autumn
brood
doubtless
furnishes
the
butterflies
that
will
be
seen
upon
the
wing
the
following
may
so
that
it
is
pretty
certain
that
they
must
find
some
shelter
in
which
to
pass
the
intervening
months
the
caterpillar
of
the
thistle
butterfly
is
about
one
and
a
quarter
inches
long
and
of
a
general
yellowish
color
more
or
less
marked
with
blackish
as
well
as
with
paler
lines
of
color
there
are
many
transverse
rows
of
spines
along
the
segments
each
yellowish
spine
having
a
circle
of
smaller
ones
at
the
top
notwithstanding
its
fondness
for
thistles
these
caterpillars
occasionally
feed
upon
various
other
plants
one
might
readily
expect
them
to
be
able
to
live
upon
other
composites
upon
which
they
are
found
but
it
seems
a
bit
strange
that
they
should
be
recorded
as
being
especially
fond
of
mallows
one
of
the
most
scholarly
students
of
american
insects
has
happily
called
the
butterflies
the
frail
children
of
the
air
it
seems
a
fitting
term
for
creatures
so
ethereal
that
they
are
readily
wafted
on
the
wings
of
the
slightest
breeze
and
so
delicate
in
structure
that
they
are
likely
to
be
sadly
mutilated
by
the
lightest
touch
of
human
hand
such
creatures
one
would
say
belong
to
regions
of
perpetual
summer
and
have
no
place
in
the
winters
of
our
northern
states
yet
if
one
goes
into
the
woods
during
one
of
the
midwinter
thaws
one
is
likely
to
see
in
every
open
glade
several
butterflies
flitting
from
tree
to
tree
or
resting
with
expanded
wings
in
the
sunniest
spots
these
butterflies
obviously
have
endured
the
coldest
weather
and
if
they
are
to
survive
until
another
season
must
continue
to
endure
still
more
this
species
is
commonly
called
the
butterfly
not
a
particularly
happy
name
for
so
beautiful
an
insect
in
england
it
has
the
more
suggestive
title
of
camberwell
beauty
and
country
boys
are
said
to
call
it
the
yellow
edge
butterfly
its
general
has
already
been
told
on
pages
the
caterpillars
of
the
butterflies
are
restricted
to
comparatively
few
food
plants
in
regions
where
they
are
not
especially
abundant
they
are
likely
to
be
found
upon
willow
poplar
or
elm
in
general
as
many
observations
indicate
they
are
as
likely
to
be
found
upon
any
one
of
these
food
plants
as
upon
either
of
the
other
two
but
in
certain
localities
where
they
become
especially
abundant
it
seems
that
they
are
more
likely
to
occur
upon
the
elm
on
this
account
they
have
been
called
the
spiny
elm
caterpillars
there
is
considerable
evidence
to
show
that
they
prefer
the
american
elm
to
other
species
of
the
genus
although
in
the
case
of
willow
and
poplar
there
seems
to
be
little
if
any
preference
as
to
the
species
miss
caroline
soule
has
seen
the
butterflies
depositing
their
eggs
upon
the
white
and
canoe
birch
and
it
has
been
recorded
as
feeding
in
labrador
and
europe
upon
a
species
of
birch
there
is
one
record
of
the
caterpillars
having
been
found
feeding
upon
the
hackberry
and
also
of
their
having
fed
greedily
upon
the
leaves
of
rose
bushes
and
still
another
of
their
having
almost
defoliated
a
pear
tree
linden
and
nettle
are
also
included
in
the
european
lists
of
the
food
plants
of
this
species
plates
pages
it
is
evident
however
that
all
of
these
except
the
three
first
named
willow
poplar
and
elm
are
to
be
regarded
as
exceptional
cases
and
that
the
normal
food
of
the
species
is
the
foliage
of
a
plant
belonging
to
one
of
these
three
genera
it
has
generally
been
supposed
that
this
species
is
in
central
and
southern
new
england
the
butterflies
of
the
first
brood
appearing
early
in
july
these
are
said
to
deposit
eggs
which
hatch
into
caterpillars
that
mature
into
butterflies
early
in
september
these
butterflies
live
through
the
winter
laying
eggs
the
following
spring
it
is
very
probable
that
as
far
north
as
southern
new
hampshire
the
species
is
commonly
during
one
season
when
the
caterpillars
were
unusually
abundant
a
very
careful
watch
was
kept
for
the
second
brood
in
new
hampshire
and
vermont
by
several
competent
observers
only
one
colony
of
caterpillars
was
found
and
this
was
at
durham
in
the
southern
part
of
new
hampshire
near
the
seacoast
consequently
it
seems
safe
to
conclude
that
in
northern
and
central
new
england
at
least
a
single
brood
is
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
this
involves
the
conclusion
that
the
butterflies
seen
upon
the
wing
early
in
autumn
are
the
same
ones
that
developed
in
july
and
that
these
same
butterflies
remain
alive
through
the
winter
and
until
in
the
following
may
they
lay
their
eggs
thus
there
is
a
period
of
ten
months
of
existence
in
the
butterfly
state
an
extraordinary
length
of
time
for
a
butterfly
to
live
to
a
large
extent
the
butterflies
disappear
in
august
and
the
question
arises
as
to
what
becomes
of
them
our
observations
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
they
go
into
summer
quarters
similar
to
those
which
they
seek
out
for
winter
shelter
apparently
they
fly
about
for
a
few
days
after
coming
from
the
chrysalis
and
then
retire
to
cool
woods
where
under
the
side
of
a
log
or
beneath
the
loose
bark
of
a
dead
tree
they
settle
down
and
to
all
appearances
go
to
sleep
the
instinct
to
remain
quiet
is
very
strong
in
these
butterflies
in
taking
the
accompanying
photographs
i
found
that
even
shortly
after
coming
from
the
chrysalis
the
butterflies
when
disturbed
would
fold
their
wings
with
the
antennae
between
them
and
drawing
the
legs
against
the
body
would
lie
quietly
on
their
sides
for
a
long
time
these
same
butterflies
would
also
hang
downward
from
a
limb
by
the
hour
in
the
hibernating
position
as
shown
in
plate
opposite
page
in
the
cooler
weather
of
early
autumn
the
butterflies
come
from
their
retreats
and
fly
about
in
the
sunshine
they
are
especially
likely
to
be
seen
along
the
borders
of
woods
or
in
open
glades
at
this
time
they
love
the
sunshine
and
will
settle
in
a
sunny
place
to
bask
in
it
into
winter
when
the
warm
days
no
longer
tempt
them
abroad
the
seek
shelter
in
many
sorts
of
situations
under
loose
bark
in
hollow
trees
under
culverts
and
bridges
in
woodpiles
in
crevices
of
rocks
or
alongside
logs
lying
on
the
ground
in
such
retreats
they
remain
until
the
sunshine
of
spring
again
calls
them
forth
parker
observations
indicate
that
these
butterflies
are
very
sensitive
to
changes
of
temperature
and
he
has
seen
the
interesting
action
of
the
butterflies
crawling
into
their
hiding
places
finding
that
this
takes
place
each
day
after
they
had
been
sunning
themselves
thus
he
writes
these
butterflies
remain
during
cool
spring
nights
in
places
similar
to
those
in
which
they
hibernate
in
winter
in
openings
in
stone
walls
in
old
in
openings
under
the
bark
of
trees
etc
they
retire
to
these
places
with
considerable
regularity
so
that
in
the
open
woods
where
dozens
of
individuals
may
have
been
seen
flitting
about
all
may
have
disappeared
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
i
have
watched
their
retreat
with
some
care
on
a
clear
afternoon
in
early
april
i
took
my
stand
in
a
woodland
where
many
butterflies
were
on
the
wing
they
continued
actively
flying
about
till
approximately
four
when
i
began
to
notice
a
diminution
in
their
numbers
by
a
quarter
past
four
not
a
butterfly
was
to
be
seen
during
the
fifteen
minutes
from
four
on
i
followed
two
to
their
hiding
places
one
alighted
on
the
front
of
a
fallen
tree
and
without
expanding
its
wings
crept
immediately
into
a
large
crack
in
the
bark
the
second
settled
on
a
stone
fence
and
crept
into
a
hole
between
some
loose
stones
the
period
during
which
this
occurred
was
marked
not
so
much
by
a
diminution
of
light
as
by
a
rapid
fall
of
temperature
that
the
habit
of
lethargy
in
cold
and
of
resting
upon
the
bark
of
trees
is
practically
universal
with
this
species
is
shown
by
a
statement
quoted
by
adams
in
his
book
beautiful
butterflies
published
in
england
in
the
writer
quoted
says
in
a
wood
on
the
summit
of
the
drachenfels
when
the
wind
was
rather
keen
i
found
numbers
resting
on
the
backs
of
fallen
trees
in
a
state
of
stupor
they
made
no
attempts
to
escape
and
when
thrown
into
the
air
their
wings
barely
opened
or
flapping
feebly
eased
their
fall
or
enabled
them
to
seek
repose
on
the
stem
of
a
rotten
trunk
rarity
in
in
many
books
this
species
is
spoken
of
by
its
english
name
camberwell
beauty
it
is
so
called
because
it
was
first
observed
in
the
neighborhood
of
camberwell
in
the
county
of
surrey
england
it
seems
that
in
that
country
it
is
a
very
rare
species
this
is
a
bit
curious
considering
the
fact
that
in
america
it
is
so
extremely
abundant
in
his
attractive
little
book
quoted
above
adams
begins
the
discussion
of
this
species
with
this
statement
this
is
the
crowning
glory
of
the
british
butterfly
collector
cabinet
and
a
happy
man
is
he
who
gets
a
perfect
specimen
of
an
insect
which
is
at
once
so
rare
and
so
beautiful
and
later
in
the
same
discussion
is
this
further
statement
concerning
the
scarcity
of
the
species
in
neither
the
larva
nor
the
pupa
state
has
the
insect
been
found
we
believe
in
this
country
where
its
appearance
occurs
except
just
here
and
there
a
single
specimen
or
two
at
long
and
uncertain
intervals
about
eighty
years
ago
it
was
seen
in
many
parts
of
the
kingdom
and
again
in
but
not
since
then
although
almost
every
year
one
or
more
specimens
are
taken
or
seen
a
curious
fact
in
regard
to
the
as
found
in
england
is
that
the
border
around
the
wings
seems
to
be
much
more
generally
white
than
it
is
with
us
westwood
in
his
book
on
british
butterflies
describes
the
margin
as
of
a
white
or
whitish
color
and
other
writers
speak
of
the
same
fact
kirby
in
his
butterflies
and
moths
makes
this
comparative
statement
the
border
is
whitest
in
british
specimens
and
perhaps
yellowest
in
american
ones
he
speaks
of
it
also
as
one
of
the
rarest
british
species
it
is
sometimes
called
by
the
common
name
the
white
border
and
also
occasionally
the
grand
surprise
appellations
which
bear
out
what
has
been
said
above
both
in
regard
to
the
color
of
the
border
and
the
rarity
of
the

the
caterpillar
chrysalis
and
butterfly
the
subsist
upon
a
considerable
variety
of
liquid
food
which
they
suck
through
their
long
tongues
in
spring
when
they
first
come
from
their
winter
quarters
they
visit
the
stumps
of
recently
cut
trees
and
suck
the
exuding
sap
a
habit
which
they
continue
whenever
opportunity
offers
fiske
has
noticed
that
they
commonly
sip
the
sap
of
maple
twigs
where
the
squirrels
have
gnawed
the
bark
a
little
later
they
visit
the
willow
catkins
to
suck
the
nectar
secreted
by
these
blossoms
and
still
later
they
hover
about
the
delicate
blossoms
of
the
mayflower
or
trailing
arbutus
for
a
similar
purpose
probably
many
other
flowers
are
thus
rifled
of
their
sweets
although
this
butterfly
seems
to
be
a
less
regular
visitor
to
flowers
than
are
many
of
its
allies
a
little
later
when
the
aphids
or
have
become
sufficiently
abundant
so
that
the
honey
dew
is
to
be
found
upon
the
infested
shrubs
these
sometimes
sip
the
liquid
sweet
from
the
surface
of
the
leaves
in
april
and
may
they
occasionally
visit
the
flowers
of
moosewood
and
later
in
the
season
have
been
observed
upon
the
blossoms
of
the
common
milkweed
from
the
time
the
early
apples
ripen
these
butterflies
may
often
be
seen
beneath
the
orchard
trees
sipping
the
liquids
of
the
fallen
and
decaying
fruit
parasites
of
the
one
fine
spring
morning
i
came
upon
a
depositing
a
cluster
of
eggs
upon
a
willow
twig
she
was
so
busily
engaged
that
i
was
able
to
draw
near
and
watch
the
operation
for
some
time
before
she
flew
away
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
i
was
much
interested
to
see
a
tiny
parasitic
fly
running
eagerly
over
the
newly
laid
eggs
and
this
fly
also
was
so
busily
interested
in
her
work
that
i
was
able
to
cut
the
twig
off
and
sit
down
to
observe
at
leisure
through
a
lens
the
actions
of
the
insect
i
dictated
to
a
companion
my
notes
of
these
observations
and
so
was
able
to
get
rather
a
complete
record
of
the
process
of
oviposition
the
tiny
fly
would
stop
over
one
of
the
butterfly
eggs
holding
its
body
vertical
with
the
hind
legs
far
back
and
the
other
legs
so
straightened
out
as
to
hold
the
front
of
the
body
high
up
then
it
would
insert
its
tiny
ovipositor
through
the
egg
shell
and
proceed
to
deposit
an
egg
of
its
own
inside
of
the
larger
egg
of
the
butterfly
at
least
it
seemed
a
safe
assumption
that
this
was
what
happened
although
of
course
it
was
impossible
to
see
the
smaller
egg
at
the
time
while
thus
engaged
the
antennae
of
the
tiny
fly
were
bent
directly
downward
to
the
egg
beneath
in
about
a
minute
the
fly
withdrew
its
ovipositor
and
after
running
around
for
a
few
seconds
again
settled
upon
another
egg
and
repeated
the
operation
then
it
tried
again
on
a
third
egg
after
which
i
got
out
my
watch
and
began
timing
the
process
these
are
the
results
in
the
case
of
the
next
dozen
eggs
that
were
laid
it
required
sec
to
lay
egg
no
then
fly
moved
around
sec
it
thus
required
an
average
of
about
two
minutes
per
egg
for
the
laying
of
these
fifteen
eggs
i
then
caught
the
little
fly
and
sent
her
to
howard
our
greatest
authority
on
this
group
of
insects
to
learn
the
name
of
the
parasite
he
identified
it
as
a
parasite
of
the
eggs
of
the
and
related
butterflies
the
most
interesting
thing
about
this
observation
was
the
fact
that
the
little
fly
had
apparently
begun
its
operation
before
the
mother
butterfly
had
finished
laying
her
cluster
of
eggs
there
were
thousands
of
willow
twigs
in
the
immediate
vicinity
how
did
this
tiny
creature
arrive
at
this
particular
place
at
the
particular
moment
when
from
its
own
point
of
view
it
was
most
needed
had
it
been
riding
around
upon
the
body
of
the
butterfly
waiting
for
the
time
when
she
should
lay
the
eggs
or
was
it
attracted
to
them
from
somewhere
in
the
immediate
vicinity
that
this
early
arrival
probably
takes
place
generally
is
indicated
by
the
fact
that
a
similar
observation
had
been
made
in
the
white
mountains
by
woodworth
the
history
of
the
egg
parasite
after
the
laying
of
the
egg
seems
to
be
comparatively
simple
it
soon
hatches
into
a
tiny
larva
that
develops
within
the
shell
at
the
expense
of
the
contents
it
finally
changes
to
a
pupa
which
in
turn
changes
to
the
little
fly
that
gnaws
a
hole
through
the
egg
shell
and
emerges
to
the
outer
world
parasites
of
the
after
hatching
from
the
egg
the
caterpillars
are
also
subject
to
the
attacks
of
various
parasites
one
of
these
is
quite
minute
not
a
great
deal
larger
than
the
egg
parasite
it
is
a
tiny
fly
which
deposits
many
eggs
in
a
single
caterpillar
the
eggs
hatch
into
tiny
maggots
that
grow
at
the
expense
of
the
caterpillar
finally
killing
it
and
changing
to
flies
again
as
many
as
of
these
parasites
have
been
known
to
emerge
from
a
single
dead
caterpillar
these
little
flies
are
called
chalcids
by
entomologists
there
is
still
another
group
of
flies
some
of
which
attack
the
antiopa
caterpillars
these
are
much
larger
than
the
chalcid
flies
and
are
called
ichneumon
flies
in
the
case
of
these
only
one
or
two
parasites
develop
in
each
caterpillar
or
chrysalis
in
addition
to
these
various
flies
there
are
certain
flies
called
tachinid
flies
that
develop
at
the
expense
of
the
caterpillars
in
new
hampshire
during
recent
years
these
appear
to
have
been
the
most
abundant
parasites
of
these
insects
an
egg
is
laid
on
the
skin
of
the
caterpillar
by
a
fly
similar
in
general
appearance
to
the
figure
below
the
contents
of
this
egg
shortly
develop
into
a
tiny
grub
that
burrows
through
the
egg
shell
and
the
skin
of
the
caterpillar
into
the
inside
of
the
body
here
it
remains
absorbing
the
body
substance
of
its
host
and
gradually
increasing
in
size
in
a
few
weeks
it
becomes
fully
developed
in
this
grub
state
by
this
time
the
caterpillar
has
become
sluggish
from
the
effects
of
the
parasite
if
the
branch
upon
which
it
feeds
is
disturbed
the
other
caterpillars
are
likely
to
crawl
away
but
the
enfeebled
victim
remains
in
its
place
illustration
tachinid
parasite
slightly
magnified
shortly
after
becoming
full
grown
the
tachinid
grub
breaks
through
the
skin
of
the
dying
caterpillar
and
falling
to
the
ground
changes
to
a
peculiar
pupa
the
outer
skin
of
the
grub
turns
brown
and
becomes
hard
forming
a
protective
covering
for
the
body
inside
a
week
or
two
later
the
insect
undergoes
another
change
and
emerges
as
a
tachinid
fly
like
the
one
that
laid
the
egg
some
weeks
before
besides
those
insects
that
develop
on
the
inside
of
the
bodies
of
these
antiopa
caterpillars
there
are
other
insect
enemies
which
attack
them
from
the
outside
and
devour
them
bodily
the
most
notable
of
these
perhaps
is
a
large
beetle
commonly
called
the
caterpillar
hunter
it
is
known
to
entomologists
as
this
is
a
very
active
insect
with
large
strong
jaws
that
runs
rapidly
about
in
search
of
victims
in
some
cases
it
has
been
observed
while
destroying
many
of
the
antiopa
larvae
in
the
southern
states
a
common
reddish
wasp
a
species
of
polistes
has
also
been
observed
attacking
these
caterpillars
and
there
are
probably
various
other
insects
that
destroy
them
although
definite
observations
showing
this
have
not
been
recorded
the
antiopa
caterpillars
are
such
spiny
creatures
that
comparatively
few
birds
attack
them
they
are
devoured
however
by
the
two
species
of
cuckoos
the
and
and
it
is
probable
that
they
are
sometimes
killed
by
baltimore
orioles
and
various
other
birds
they
are
also
greedily
devoured
by
toads
but
of
course
they
do
not
often
come
within
the
reach
of
these
useful
animals
even
the
adult
butterflies
of
this
species
have
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
enemies
during
the
long
months
of
their
life
many
of
them
probably
succumb
to
the
attacks
of
birds
or
other
creatures
i
have
seen
but
one
such
tragedy
while
riding
along
a
country
highway
with
a
friend
one
spring
day
we
saw
a
male
maryland
flit
by
with
a
in
his
mouth
the
bird
lit
on
a
fence
from
which
i
startled
him
so
that
he
dropped
the
butterfly

worn
and
faded
specimen

places
where
the
bird
held
the
insect
were

american
this
beautiful
butterfly
is
one
of
the
most
distinctive
of
all
our
species
it
is
of
moderate
size
its
wings
rarely
expanding
more
than
two
inches
and
it
has
sufficiently
irregular
outlines
to
indicate
its
relationship
with
the
the
most
striking
feature
of
the
upper
surface
is
the
broad
band
of
extending
clear
across
both
wings
a
little
inside
the
border
the
remaining
surface
is
a
darker
brown
marked
with
two
spots
near
the
front
margin
of
each
front
wing
and
having
scattered
iridescent
scales
which
show
plainly
under
a
lens
the
suggestion
of
the
coloring
of
a
is
easily
seen
in
these
rich
brown
tones
the
under
surface
is
a
wonderful
illustration
of
protective
coloring
with
wings
closed
and
resting
against
the
bark
of
trees
or
lying
beneath
the
trees
among
fallen
leaves
it
would
require
a
keen
eye
to
detect
the
insect
plates
pages
the
american
is
distinctly
a
northern
species
north
of
latitude
degrees
it
seems
to
occur
practically
from
ocean
to
ocean
extending
far
up
toward
the
arctic
region
it
is
commonly
found
in
british
america
as
far
north
as
fort
simpson
in
latitude
degrees
there
are
specimens
in
the
british
museum
collected
by
the
explorer
ross
in
arctic
america
and
there
are
many
in
our
own
national
museum
collected
in
the
hudson
bay
region
by
various
american
explorers
in
new
england
the
species
is
abundant
at
times
in
new
hampshire
vermont
and
maine
in
the
vicinity
of
new
york
city
and
buffalo
new
york
it
is
rather
rare
and
south
of
this
latitude
it
is
found
chiefly
at
the
higher
elevations
in
mountainous
districts
as
a
rule
it
is
likely
to
vary
in
numbers
from
year
to
year
sometimes
being
extremely
abundant
while
more
commonly
it
is
rather
rare
these
are
the
same
sorts
of
fluctuations
that
we
find
in
the
case
of
the
the
american
tent
caterpillar
and
various
other
insects
whose
larvae
live
in
colonies
the
variation
is
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
when
the
caterpillars
become
unusually
abundant
they
become
correspondingly
conspicuous
and
so
provide
a
shining
mark
that
is
soon
discovered
by
their
insect
enemies
or
by
various
fungous
diseases
story
of
its
in
its
manner
of
laying
eggs
this
butterfly
differs
from
most
others
the
great
majority
of
our
familiar
species
lay
their
eggs
one
in
a
place
or
possibly
two
or
three
near
together
some
species
deposit
several
in
a
group
while
some
like
the
may
lay
two
or
three
dozen
in
a
cluster
very
few
however
deposit
hundreds
in
a
bunch
two
of
these
are
the
baltimore
and
this
american
in
the
case
of
the
latter
the
eggs
are
loosely
laid
hundreds
together
upon
the
leaves
of
the
common
stinging
nettle
probably
each
female
can
deposit
six
or
eight
hundred
eggs
in
less
than
a
week
the
eggs
hatch
into
minute
blackish
caterpillars
that
feed
upon
the
tender
tissues
of
the
leaf
upon
which
they
were
born
and
then
migrate
together
toward
the
top
of
the
plant
in
their
habits
they
are
quite
similar
to
the
caterpillars
of
the
as
each
walks
it
spins
from
its
mouth
a
silken
thread
and
the
combined
effect
of
hundreds
of
these
threads
is
to
make
a
noticeable
silken
web
over
the
leaves
the
caterpillars
remain
in
colonies
feeding
together
from
day
to
day
and
gradually
denuding
the
upper
branches
of
the
nettle
plant
leaving
an
unsightly
silken
web
as
a
memento
of
their
presence
this
webbing
is
very
suggestive
of
the
similar
result
left
behind
by
a
colony
of
caterpillars
upon
the
twigs
of
elm
or
poplar
when
about
half
grown
these
caterpillars
are
likely
to
scatter
more
or
less
in
accidental
groups
which
may
make
small
shelter
tents
from
the
larger
leaves
in
each
little
nest
there
may
be
four
or
five
or
more
of
the
caterpillars
from
these
shelter
tents
they
sally
forth
to
feed
upon
the
adjacent
leaves
and
a
little
later
become
full
grown
as
caterpillars
each
now
wanders
away
and
finding
such
shelter
as
it
is
able
to
spins
a
button
of
silk
and
becomes
a
chrysalis
it
remains
in
this
condition
but
a
short
time
before
it
emerges
again
as
the
beautiful
butterfly
this
species
is
commonly
reputed
to
have
three
broods
a
year
hibernating
both
as
a
butterfly
and
as
a
chrysalis
it
has
been
suggested
however
by
fiske
one
of
our
most
painstaking
entomologists
who
has
studied
the
butterflies
of
new
hampshire
for
many
years
that
it
is
more
probably
with
a
period
of
aestivation
during
the
later
weeks
of
summer
this
seems
a
very
probable
condition
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
some
observer
will
make
such
a
careful
study
of
this
species
as
to
settle
the
point
definitely
in
the
case
of
many
butterflies
the
distribution
of
the
species
coincides
with
the
distribution
of
the
food
plant
this
american
however
is
perhaps
the
exception
that
may
prove
the
rule
for
its
southward
limit
is
far
north
of
the
southern
range
of
the
stinging
nettle
evidently
it
is
a
species
which
has
developed
in
adjustment
to
the

climate

not

butterfly
or
compton
during
bright
days
in
march
and
april
one
is
likely
to
find
two
kinds
of
butterflies
on
the
wing
in
open
glades
of
the
woods
one
is
the
familiar
and
the
other
is
the
compton
tortoise
the
latter
generally
much
less
abundant
than
the
former
both
make
the
most
of
the
brief
periods
of
sunshine
and
quickly
disappear
when
the
sky
is
overcast
the
compton
tortoise
butterflies
which
are
thus
abroad
in
early
spring
have
been
in
hibernation
since
october
they
are
helping
to
carry
the
species
over
from
one
season
to
another
and
as
the
days
become
longer
and
warmer
they
appear
on
the
wing
more
and
more
seeking
such
liquid
food
as
the
field
and
forest
yields
during
the
days
of
early
spring
the
sap
exuding
from
holes
in
bark
made
by
woodpeckers
or
from
the
tappings
of
the
maple
trees
by
man
the
nectar
of
willow
catkins
the
moisture
of
roadside
pools
these
help
to
yield
a
precarious
sustenance
to
these
butterflies
after
their
long
winter
fast
they
remain
upon
the
wing
week
after
week
while
spring
slowly
progresses
in
the
northern
regions
they
inhabit
when
at
last
the
leaves
push
out
on
their
food
trees
willow
birch
and
elm
the
females
lay
their
eggs
and
then
having
lived
to
what
for
a
butterfly
is
a
ripe
old
age
they
die
after
nearly
ten
months
of
adult
existence
apparently
the
eggs
are
laid
in
clusters
on
the
twigs
although
this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
many
facts
about
butterflies
awaiting
observation
by
some
careful
student
the
caterpillars
feed
together
in
small
colonies
but
make
no
nest
they
become
full
grown
in
about
a
month
they
are
then
nearly
two
inches
long
with
spinous
greenish
bodies
striped
with
lighter
lines
some
change
to
chrysalids
about
the
middle
of
june
and
ten
days
later
change
again
to
butterflies
the
first
of
which
appear
early
in
july
while
others
continue
to
emerge
for
nearly
a
month
these
butterflies
may
be
seen
rather
frequently
from
midsummer
on
visiting
various
flowers
and
sipping
the
juices
from
decaying
fruits
beneath
the
trees
at
times
they
seem
to
disappear
in
august
to
reappear
in
october
a
fact
which
has
led
some
observers
to
suggest
that
there
is
a
second
brood
the
caterpillars
of
this
brood
however
have
never
been
observed
and
a
much
more
probable
explanation
has
been
made
by
fiske
who
studied
the
butterflies
of
new
hampshire
carefully
for
many
years
he
found
that
in
the
hot
summer
weather
this
butterfly
goes
into
a
seclusion
similar
to
that
of
its
winter
rest
that
is
it
aestivates
in
summer
and
hibernates
in
winter
the
possibility
that
the
october
did
not
represent
a
second
brood
writes
fiske
was
rendered
almost
a
certainty
by
repeated
observations
which
failed
to
disclose
a
single
specimen
approximating
in
freshness
to
average
august
individuals
and
the
question
of
their
whereabouts
during
the
interim
was
unexpectedly
answered
one
warm
august
day
by
my
finding
several
snugly
packed
away
under
the
shingles
on
an
old
roof
the
theory
of
the
aestivation
of
the
butterflies
of
this
group
will
explain
a
good
many
points
hitherto
obscure
in
the
life
histories
of
the
other
species
in
october
these
butterflies
seek
their
winter
quarters
finding
them
in
woods
and
groves
apparently
they
commonly
rest
upon
the
bark
of
the
trunk
as
well
as
crawl
into
such
crevices
beneath
loose
bark
as
they
can
find
here
they
remain
through
fall
winter
and
spring
except
when
called
into
brief
periods
of
activity
by
the
unwonted
warmth
of
the
winter
sunshine
then
in
spring
they
come
forth
again
to
lay
the
eggs
for
the
caterpillars
of
the
new
generation
the
fresh
butterflies
are
creatures
of
exquisitely
modulated
coloring
the
name
compton
tortoise
has
reference
to
the
rich
brown
tones
of
the
upper
wing
surface
suggestive
of
those
of
fine
in
fresh
specimens
much
of
the
surface
especially
in
the
middle
and
along
the
front
border
is
overlaid
with
iridescent
purple
scales
near
the
front
outer
angle
of
each
of
the
four
wings
there
is
a
distinct
white
spot
divided
near
the
middle
by
a
darker
line
of
the
vein
running
through
it
the
under
surface
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
mimicry
of
gray
bark
to
be
found
in
any
butterfly
the
tones
vary
considerably
in
different
individuals
but
in
all
the
protection
must
be
well
nigh
perfect
when
the
insect
is
at
rest
with
closed
wings
upon
the
bark
of
a
tree
the
striking
angularity
of
the
wing
border
doubtless
helps
to
conceal
it
and
the
habit
of
dropping
motionless
to
the
ground
when
disturbed
must
also
have
protective
value

the
middle

from

north

labrador
british

toward
its

it
occurs
only
on
the
higher

are

throughout

both
the

the

in
fact
this
is
apparently
the
only
species

it

one
of
the
greatest
prizes
which
the
collector
can
obtain
in

it
is
an
abundant

the
species
of
the

which
have
been

called
the

these
are
rather
large
butterflies
with
rounded
wings
which
are
found
in
one
species
or
another
over
practically
the
whole
of
north

some
of

beauty

also
present

the

may
be

from
so
many
interesting
points
of
view
that
it
is
a
bit
difficult
to
know
which
phases
to
emphasize
in
general
there
is
a
striking
similarity
in
their
structure
and
habits
in
the
earlier
stages
the
eggs
are
very
nearly
alike
the
caterpillars
resemble
one
another
so
closely
that
even
expert
entomologists
sometimes
have
to
decide
what
species
a
collected
caterpillar
belongs
to
by
seeing
what
plant
it
is
feeding
upon
and
the
chrysalids
are
also
very
similar
some
of
the
more
interesting
phases
in
the
development
of
these
insects
are
discussed
in
connection
with
the
of
the
different
species
a
phase
which
is
characteristic
to
all
of
them
may
well
be
emphasized
here
from
the
time
the
caterpillars
hatch
until
they
change
to
chrysalids
they
illustrate
to
a
marked
degree
an
adaptation
through
structure
and
habit
which
must
very
largely
protect
them
from
attack
by
birds
and
other
enemies
their
structure
and
markings
are
almost
grotesque
the
body
is
covered
with
strange
appendages
and
it
is
colored
with
a
curious
mottling
of
tones
of
green
drab
brown
and
white
which
is
very
difficult
to
describe
but
which
suggests
as
the
caterpillar
rests
upon
rough
bark
simply
a
bit
of
bird
dung
or
some
natural
excrescence
the
caterpillars
have
the
habit
of
feeding
at
night
and
remaining
upon
their
perches
by
day
often
assuming
positions
which
are
very
unusual
among
insect
larvae
such
positions
in
which
they
remain
motionless
for
hours
at
a
time
are
undoubtedly
of
protective
value
and
help
to
conceal
the
insect
after
the
caterpillars
are
half
grown
they
rest
not
upon
the
leaves
upon
which
they
feed
but
rather
upon
the
bark
of
twigs
or
branches
where
their
peculiar
structure
is
likely
to
make
them
inconspicuous
the
chrysalids
of
the
sovereigns
are
also
curiously
mottled
in
color
tones
that
will
probably
lead
to
their
being
overlooked
three
distinct
species
of
sovereigns
are
found
in
eastern
north
america
namely
the
viceroy
the
banded
purple
the
purple
the
first
species
the
viceroy
has
a
much
wider
distribution
than
either
of
the
others
it
apparently
is
found
in
nearly
all
localities
in
which
either
of
these
occur
and
so
includes
within
its
range
almost
the
whole
of
the
united
states
and
much
of
canada
the
second
of
these
the
banded
purple
is
a
northern
form
it
is
found
commonly
at
least
as
far
north
as
the
mackenzie
river
region
in
british
america
and
southward
to
central
massachusetts
it
also
occurs
as
far
west
as
nebraska
so
that
it
has
a
very
wide
distribution
in
northern
regions
it
is
especially
abundant
in
canada
and
the
white
mountains
the
third
the
purple
is
the
characteristic
form
south
of
latitude
degrees
its
range
overlaps
that
of
the
banded
purple
for
about
one
degree
but
it
is
seldom
found
north
of
latitude
degrees
it
seems
to
range
about
as
far
west
as
the
banded
purple
there
are
several
other
butterflies
belonging
to
this
genus
which
are
rarely
found
and
which
occur
only
in
certain
limited
regions
there
has
been
much
discussion
in
regard
to
these
some
entomologists
have
thought
them
simply
varieties
or
dimorphic
forms
while
others
have
considered
them
hybrids
an
analysis
of
the
conditions
shows
that
these
doubtful
butterflies
occur
only
in
regions
where
the
different
species
overlap
thus
in
the
boundary
connecting
the
banded
purple
and
the
purple
there
are
forms
which
resemble
these
two
species
in
such
a
way
as
to
suggest
that
these
are
the
parents
of
the
hybrid
in
localities
where
the
viceroy
and
the
banded
purple
occur
there
are
other
forms
which
seem
to
connect
these
two
species
and
in
the
locality
where
the
viceroy
and
the
purple
occur
there
are
still
other
forms
which
seem
to
suggest
these
as
the
parents
so
the
evidence
seems
pretty
conclusive
that
where
these
butterflies
overlap
there
are
likely
to
be
occasional
crosses
between
the
species
which
result
in
these
natural
hybrids
in
the
far
western
states
there
are
certain
other
species
of
basilarchia
which
take
the
place
of
the
eastern
form
one
of
the
most
abundant
of
these
on
the
pacific
coast
is
sometimes
called
admiral
in
florida
there
is
another
species
which
is
found
in
the
southern
states
it
is
the
only
one
whose
coloring
resembles
that
of
the
viceroy
the
common
name
of
this
butterfly
was
probably
given
it
in
allusion
to
its
resemblance
to
the
monarch
butterfly
for
the
monarch
and
the
viceroy
have
been
closely
associated
in
the
minds
of
many
observers
ever
since
people
began
to
study
butterflies
in
america
these
two
insects
have
become
famous
as
the
most
notable
examples
that
we
have
of
the
mimicking
of
one
butterfly
by
another
according
to
the
theory
which
has
been
held
by
many
naturalists
the
monarch
is
distasteful
to
birds
and
other
animals
and
it
advertises
the
fact
by
its
bright
combination
of
brown
and
black
the
monarch
is
thus
an
example
of
what
has
often
been
called
warning
coloration
on
the
other
hand
the
viceroy
is
commonly
supposed
to
have
no
objectionable
taste
when
eaten
by
birds
but
it
so
closely
resembles
the
monarch
in
its
color
pattern
and
its
habits
of
flight
that
it
has
been
assumed
that
birds
would
not
touch
it
because
of
its
resemblance
to
the
distasteful
butterfly
there
has
however
recently
been
a
reaction
among
naturalists
in
regard
to
the
validity
of
many
supposed
examples
of
warning
coloration
and
the
whole
subject
is
still
open
to
careful
investigation
cover
and

whether
the
viceroy
deserves
its
celebrity
as
an
insect
mimic
or
not
it
is
well
worthy
of
study
for
other
reasons
it
is
a
common
and
attractive
butterfly
and
it
has
most
interesting
habits
in
the
larval
state
it
is
found
over
a
large
part
of
north
america
and
flies
freely
from
spring
until
autumn
over
meadows
fields
and
open
glades
yearly
cycle
of
to
trace
the
yearly
cycle
of
this
butterfly
life
let
us
begin
with
one
of
the
mother
insects
flitting
along
a
stream
in
early
summer
she
stops
now
and
then
to
lay
an
egg
on
the
tip
of
a
leaf
on
a
willow
or
poplar
she
then
continues
on
her
way
occasionally
sipping
nectar
from
any
early
flowers
she
may
chance
to
find
and
continuing
her
leisurely
life
perhaps
for
several
weeks
the
egg
thus
laid
upon
the
poplar
leaf
remains
in
position
for
a
week
or
more
unless
it
should
be
devoured
by
some
wandering
ant
or
discovered
by
some
tiny
parasite
if
it
escapes
these
dangers
it
hatches
into
a
minute
caterpillar
that
escapes
from
the
egg
shell
through
a
hole
in
its
side
after
it
has
come
out
it
turns
around
and
eats
the
remainder
of
the
shell
it
then
begins
feeding
upon
the
tender
tissue
of
the
leaf
it
is
resting
upon
nibbling
at
the
sides
until
its
appetite
is
satisfied
then
it
retires
to
the
midrib
on
the
lower
surface
where
it
remains
quietly
through
the
day
and
thereafter
feeds
chiefly
at
night
after
about
a
week
it
becomes
too
large
for
the
skin
with
which
it
was
born
so
it
moults
and
immediately
devours
its
cast
skin
it
continues
these
operations
of
feeding
and
moulting
at
occasional
intervals
for
several
weeks
finally
becoming
a
rather
large
and
curious
looking
caterpillar
mottled
in
greenish
olive
and
light
gray
with
two
large
projections
from
the
front
of
the
body
it
finally
becomes
full
grown
in
this
larval
state
then
it
spins
a
web
of
silk
upon
the
bark
of
the
twig
and
entangles
the
hooked
claws
of
its
hind
legs
in
the
silken
web
it
thus
hangs
downward
until
the
larval
skin
is
shuffled
off
and
the
curious
pupa
with
the
conspicuous
hump
upon
the
middle
of
its
back
remains
in
its
place
this
chrysalis
is
of
a
mottled
coloring
very
similar
to
that
of
the
caterpillar
a
week
or
so
later
the
chrysalis
skin
breaks
open
and
the
butterfly
comes
out
catching
hold
of
the
twig
with
its
legs
and
hanging
quietly
in
position
while
its
wings
expand
the
butterflies
of
this
brood
are
likely
to
appear
late
in
summer
it
is
the
second
brood
of
adult
butterflies
for
the
season
these
insects
have
the
same
leisurely
habits
as
those
that
were
on
the
wing
earlier
in
the
season
in
a
similar
way
the
mother
butterflies
lay
their
eggs
on
the
leaves
of
willows
and
poplars
and
these
eggs
soon
hatch
into
young
caterpillars
that
look
like
those
that
hatched
in
early
summer
the
caterpillars
however
of
this
autumnal
brood
have
a
most
interesting
habit
which
was
entirely
lacking
in
those
of
early
summer
soon
after
hatching
they
begin
to
make
for
themselves
little
houses
in
which
to
pass
the
winter
this
is
very
cleverly
done
by
utilizing
part
of
the
leaf
upon
which
they
are
feeding
each
side
of
the
leaf
toward
its
tip
is
eaten
off
with
the
midrib
remaining
untouched
then
the
lower
half
of
the
leaf
which
has
not
been
eaten
is
rolled
into
a
tube
and
securely
sewed
together
with
silken
threads
the
stem
of
the
leaf
is
also
covered
with
a
similar
silken
web
and
securely
fastened
to
the
twig
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
leaf
to
fall
off
when
the
other
leaves
do
the
little
caterpillar
thus
cleverly
provides
itself
with
a
safe
winter
home
into
which
it
retreats
on
the
approach
of
cold
weather
to
remain
until
spring
they
enter
these
little
cases
head
first
and
apparently
seldom
emerge
again
until
the
warm
spring
sun
brings
them
forth
to
feed
upon
the
developing
willow
catkins
or
the
unfolding
leaves
the
caterpillars
that
thus
pass
the
winter
in
these
cases
are
perhaps
a
third
grown
they
develop
rapidly
in
spring
and
are
likely
to
use
the
cases
for
resting
purposes
when
they
are
not
feeding
after
a
few
weeks
they
become
caterpillars
and
change
to
chrysalids
to
change
again
a
little
later
into
the
butterflies
that
appear
in
early
summer
there
are
thus
two
broods
of
each
stage
of
the
insect
during
the
year
caterpillar
this
brief
summary
of
the
yearly
history
of
the
viceroy
is
by
no
means
adequate
as
a
story
of
the
many
interesting
things
to
be
told
about
this
insect
which
has
been
carefully
studied
by
several
eminent
naturalists
one
of
these
is
the
strange
habit
the
very
young
caterpillars
have
of
fastening
a
few
bits
of
leaf
together
by
means
of
silken
threads
and
then
tying
the
bunch
to
the
denuded
rib
of
the
leaf
to
explain
this
allow
me
to
quote
from
an
admirable
essay
of
the
late
samuel
scudder
whose
studies
of
butterflies
have
added
so
much
to
our
knowledge
of
these
beautiful
creatures
soon
after
birth
wrote
scudder
when
it
has
eaten
but
a
very
few
swaths
down
the
leaf
the
little
fellow
constructs
a
small
and
loose
packet
from
minute
bits
of
leaf
and
other
rejectamenta
loosely
fastened
to
one
another
and
to
the
midrib
close
to
but
scarcely
touching
the
eaten
edge
of
the
leaf
and
as
fast
as
the
leaf
is
eaten
it
removes
this
packet
continually
added
to
until
it
becomes
almost
as
big
as
a
small
pea
farther
and
farther
down
the
midrib
away
from
its
perch
always
keeping
it
near
the
eaten
edge
it
should
be
noted
that
it
is
so
loosely
attached
the
bits
of
leaf
at
all
possible
angles
that
it
is
moved
by
the
least
breath
meanwhile
the
caterpillar
has
been
growing
larger
and
more
conspicuous
and
thus
in
greater
peril
from
its
enemies
there
are
two
possible
services
that
this
odd
packet
may
render
a
spider
wandering
over
a
leaf
and
observing
its
motion
may
seize
it
and
thinking
it
has
a
prize
hurry
away
with
it
and
leave
its
architect
unharmed
this
seems
to
me
rather
a
strained
suggestion
for
a
wandering
spider
would
probably
proceed
to
investigate
it
on
the
spot
another
explanation
seems
more
probable
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
leaves
preferred
by
these
creatures
as
food
are
mostly
such
as
are
easily
shaken
by
the
wind
and
as
the
caterpillar
moves
with
the
leaf
and
with
all
the
surrounding
leaves
in
a
continual
fluttering
in
the
case
of
the
trembling
aspen
and
to
a
less
degree
in
the
other
food
plants
this
of
itself
is
a
protection
to
it
as
it
would
more
readily
escape
observation
as
an
object
distinct
from
the
leaves
all
being
in
motion
together
but
on
the
more
stable
leaves
like
the
willow
the
motion
in
a
feeble
wind
would
not
be
sufficient
to
be
serviceable
and
here
at
least
the
packet
comes
into
play
an
object
in
motion
among
others
at
rest
is
a
noticeable
thing
a
fact
well
recognized
among
animals
as
a
host
of
them
show
when
they
fear
being
seen
this
packet
attached
by
loose
silken
threads
moves
as
stated
with
a
breath
of
wind
and
so
would
distract
attention
from
its
architect
near
by
who
has
taken
pains
to
place
it
at
the
farthest
remove
from
his
perch
while
still
to
avoid
undesirable
steps
on
his
daily
track
if
this
be
really
its
object
it
is
surely
one
of
the
oddest
devices
in
nature
the
curious
winter
cases
of
the
viceroy
were
first
carefully
described
by
the
late
riley
in
one
of
his
classic
reports
on
the
insects
of
missouri
it
is
one
of
the
best
accounts
which
has
ever
been
written
and
is
well
worth
quoting
at
some
length
the
larvae
of
the
autumnal
brood
wrote
doctor
riley
when
about
one
fourth
or
one
third
grown
build
for
themselves
curious
little
houses
in
which
they
pass
the
winter
first
and
foremost
with
wise
forethought
and
being
well
aware
through
its
natural
instincts
that
the
leaf
which
it
has
collected
for
its
house
will
fall
to
the
ground
when
the
cold
weather
sets
in
unless
it
takes
measures
to
prevent
this
the
larva
fastens
the
stem
of
the
leaf
with
silken
cables
securely
to
the
twig
from
which
it
grows
it
then
gnaws
off
the
blade
of
the
leaf
at
its
tip
end
leaving
little
else
but
the
midrib
finally
it
rolls
the
remaining
part
of
the
blade
of
the
leaf
into
a
cylinder
sewing
the
edges
together
with
silk
the
basal
portion
of
the
cylinder
is
of
course
tapered
to
a
point
as
the
edges
of
the
leaf
are
nearly
drawn
together
not
overlapped
and
invariably
the
lower
side
of
the
leaf
forms
the
outside
of
the
house
so
as
to
have
the
projecting
midrib
out
of
the
way
of
the
larva
as
it
reposes
snugly
on
the
inside
the
whole
when
finished
has
somewhat
the
appearance
of
the
leaf
of
a
miniature
its
length
being
inch
and
its
diameter
inch
these
curious
little
cases
may
be
commonly
found
upon
our
willows
and
poplars
in
the
winter
time
i
have
examined
hundreds
of
them
and
although
they
are
invariably
built
upon
this
plan
they
vary
greatly
in
the
degree
of
perfection
which
the
architect
attained
and
this
is
especially
the
case
where
they
have
been
built
in
confinement
the
blade
on
the
tip
piece
is
sometimes
gnawed
off
right
down
to
the
rib
at
others
it
is
left
almost
as
broad
as
the
tube
sometimes
it
is
bent
over
the
orifice
at
others
not
they
are
also
much
more
irregular
and
ungainly
when
made
with
broad
leaves
such
as
those
of
the
silver
poplar
than
when
made
from
the
more
narrow
leaves
of
the
willow
tree
these
autumnal
larvae
have
also
another
peculiar
habit
they
exhibit
a
tendency
to
build
from
the
time
they
are
hatched
and
will
always
eat
the
leaves
from
the
side
gnawing
large
holes
and
cutting
along
the
sides
of
the
midrib
they
commence
at
the
tip
and
as
they
work
downward
toward
the
base
they
collect
the
débris
into
a
little
bunch
which
they
fasten
with
silk
to
the
midrib
when
the
hibernaculum
is
finished
the
seam
is
perfectly
smooth
and
the
hole
inside
is
lined
with
silk
the
larva
having
completed
its
work
composes
itself
for
the
winter
with
the
hind
end
toward
the
orifice
here
it
remains
till
the
catkins
are
in
bloom
the
next
spring
when
it
retreats
from
its
house
and
commences
feeding
not
the
least
wonderful
part
of
this
phenomenon
is
that
it
is
only
the
autumnal
brood
of
larvae
that
form
houses
to
live
in
during
the
inclement
season
of
the
year
the
summer
brood
having
no
occasion
to
shelter
themselves
from
cold
it
is
an
interesting
fact
that
in
most
northern
regions
these
winter
cases
are
nearly
always
made
so
near
the
ground
that
they
are
protected
by
snow
during
most
of
the
winter
when
an
insect
has
such
a
curious
habit
as
that
of
making
these
winter
cases
it
seems
comparatively
easy
to
explain
it
as
an
acquired
instinct
brought
about
through
the
conditions
of
life
during
the
long
period
in
which
successive
generations
have
been
laid
but
as
doctor
riley
seems
to
suggest
above
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
explain
this
sort
of
phenomenon
when
it
occurs
only
in
one
of
two
or
more
broods
during
the
season
banded
none
of
our
common
butterflies
shows
more
striking
color
markings
than
the
banded
purple
a
broad
white
stripe
runs
midway
through
the
wings
on
both
surfaces
the
white
making
a
strong
contrast
to
the
purplish
or
brownish
black
of
the
rest
of
the
wings
this
white
band
is
supplemented
by
rows
of
fulvous
and
of
blue
dots
especially
on
both
surfaces
of
the
hind
wings
this
butterfly
is
a
northern
form
ranging
to
a
large
extent
north
of
the
regions
occupied
by
the
viceroy
its
is
very
similar
to
that
of
the
latter
insect
the
caterpillars
have
the
same
curious
habits
and
bear
a
close
general
resemblance
to
one
another
the
banded
purple
butterflies
appear
in
june
and
lay
their
eggs
in
july
upon
the
tips
of
the
leaves
of
birches
especially
the
black
birch
almost
all
of
these
eggs
are
laid
within
two
or
three
feet
of
the
ground
they
are
of
grayish
green
color
the
caterpillars
are
or
about
a
week
after
the
egg
is
laid
it
hatches
into
a
small
caterpillar
that
feeds
upon
the
sides
of
the
leaf
and
rests
upon
the
midrib
just
as
the
viceroy
caterpillar
does
it
continues
to
feed
through
july
and
the
early
part
of
august
moulting
once
or
twice
before
it
begins
to
form
the
winter
case
it
usually
goes
into
this
during
the
latter
part
of
august
when
it
is
in
the
second
or
third
caterpillar
stage
from
then
on
it
remains
quietly
in
its
winter
home
being
covered
by
the
deep
snows
during
several
months
and
coming
out
about
the
middle
of
the
following
may
when
the
spring
warmth
starts
the
buds
of
its
food
plant
it
then
feeds
for
two
or
three
weeks
before
it
changes
to
a
chrysalis
to
emerge
in
june
as
a
butterfly
there
seems
to
be
normally
but
one
brood
each
year
although
under
exceptional
conditions
some
of
the
eggs
laid
in
july
mature
into
butterflies
the
same
season
but
it
is
probable
that
these
butterflies
either
do
not
lay
eggs
and
perish
as
the
cold
comes
on
or
that
if
they
do
lay
eggs
the
caterpillars
that
hatch
from
them
do
not
get
large
enough
to
construct
their
winter
cases
consequently
it
is
doubtful
if
we
can
consider
the
insect
really
even
in
part
were
it
not
for
the
wonderful
iridescence
of
its
wings
the
purple
would
be
one
of
the
most
plainly
marked
of
the
sovereigns
but
the
upper
surface
of
both
pairs
of
wings
is
thickly
covered
with
iridescent
scales
which
give
the
insect
a
shimmering
beauty
that
makes
it
conspicuous
among
northern
butterflies
suggesting
something
of
the
marvelous
coloring
of
the
large
tropical
species
the
general
coloring
is
a
purplish
black
with
rows
of
white
dots
along
the
borders
of
the
wings
the
under
surface
shows
much
more
of
the
fulvous
brown
which
is
so
characteristic
of
the
viceroy
the
brownish
background
being
rather
thinly
overlaid
with
iridescent
scales
but
with
a
large
number
of
spots
and
stripes
where
the
fulvous
color
alone
shows
the
favorite
food
plants
of
this
species
belong
to
the
great
order
which
includes
the
apple
pear
cherry
rose
and
many
other
common
trees
and
shrubs
the
egg
is
laid
upon
the
extreme
tip
of
the
leaf
a
characteristic
habit
of
all
the
species
of
basilarchia
it
obviously
must
have
decided
advantages
in
preserving
the
eggs
from
attack
by
ants
spiders
ichneumon
flies
and
other
enemies
all
of
these
creatures
are
constantly
patrolling
leaf
surfaces
in
search
of
eggs
and
minute
insects
they
are
much
more
likely
to
find
their
victims
upon
the
broad
general
surface
than
upon
the
extreme
tip
of
narrowly
pointed
leaves
the
eggs
of
all
these
butterflies
are
small
and
pitted
much
like
a
tiny
little
honeycomb
with
a
large
number
of
tiny
hairs
arising
from
the
surface
these
hairs
are
very
similar
to
the
hairs
upon
the
surface
of
many
leaves
and
they
probably
assist
in
leading
other
insects
to
overlook
the
eggs
yet
notwithstanding
these
devices
for
protection
it
remains
true
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
eggs
are
attacked
by
tiny
parasites
and
probably
many
others
are
eaten
by
ants
and
spiders
this
very
fact
emphasizes
the
necessity
of
such
protective
features
as
the
laying
of
one
egg
in
a
place
upon
the
tip
of
a
leaf
and
the
hairy
covering
on
the
egg
shells
a
few
days
after
the
eggs
are
laid
each
hatches
into
a
small
caterpillar
that
immediately
begins
feeding
upon
the
green
tissues
beside
it
first
however
devouring
the
empty
egg
shell
it
does
not
eat
the
midrib
of
the
leaf
but
utilizes
it
as
a
perch
generally
winding
it
more
or
less
with
silken
threads
apparently
to
make
it
stronger
and
to
prevent
it
from
curling
up
the
caterpillar
seems
to
feed
chiefly
at
night
resting
quietly
by
day
after
a
week
or
so
it
moults
and
then
continues
feeding
as
before
it
continues
to
feed
and
grow
for
several
weeks
moulting
regularly
until
it
becomes
full
fed
as
a
caterpillar
it
then
spins
a
web
of
silk
closely
upon
the
bark
of
twig
or
branch
or
possibly
upon
some
other
object
near
at
hand
in
this
web
it
entangles
the
hooked
claws
of
its
hind
legs
and
hangs
downward
preparatory
to
the
change
to
the
chrysalis
soon
afterward
the
last
larval
skin
is
shed
and
the
chrysalis
hangs
in
place
of
the
caterpillar
this
chrysalis
has
the
characteristic
form
of
all
the
members
of
this
limited
group
the
outer
skin
being
well
hardened
and
there
being
a
very
prominent
projection
on
the
middle
of
the
back
the
chrysalis
hangs
thus
buffeted
more
or
less
by
wind
and
rain
for
about
ten
days
then
the
skin
breaks
apart
and
the
butterfly
emerges
over
a
large
part
of
its
range
there
are
two
broods
of
this
butterfly
each
year
the
adults
appear
in
early
summer
and
lay
eggs
which
develop
into
butterflies
again
during
the
latter
part
of
summer
the
of
this
generation
is
the
one
described
in
the
last
paragraph
the
eggs
laid
by
these
late
summer
butterflies
however
require
a
somewhat
different
story
they
hatch
in
the
same
way
as
the
others
but
when
the
caterpillars
have
moulted
about
twice
they
form
a
winter
case
or
hibernaculum
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
the
caterpillars
of
the
viceroy
they
remain
within
these
winter
homes
till
the
following
spring
when
they
come
forth
and
complete
their
development
producing
the
early
summer
brood
of
butterflies
with
which
our
story
began
in
florida
and
some
of
the
other
southern
states
there
is
a
butterfly
which
looks
almost
like
the
viceroy
except
that
the
brown
coloring
of
the
wings
is
very
much
darker
the
species
has
been
called
the
vicereine
as
it
is
believed
to
mimic
the
queen
butterfly
a
species
closely
related
to
the
monarch
and
occurring
in
the
southern
states
the
vicereine
probably
has
a
very
similar
to
that
of
its
northern
cousin
of
the

color
of

of

a

the

the
members
of
this
small
group
are
distinguished
from
the
closely
related
sovereigns
by
the
tailed
hind
wings
in
one
species
by
the
on
the
upper
surface
of
the
wings
of
the
others
and
by
the
fact
that
on
the
club
of
the
antennae
there
are
three
instead
of
four
longitudinal
ridges
there
is
also
a
distinction
in
the
arrangement
of
the
veins
of
the
hind
wings
this
tribe
is
represented
in
our
northern
fauna
by
only
two
genera
in
the
genus
chlorippe
the
antennae
are
as
long
as
the
front
wings
are
wide
in
the
genus
anoea
the
antennae
are
much
shorter
than
the
width
of
the
front
wings
only
two
species
of
the
former
and
one
of
the
latter
are
sufficiently
abundant
to
be
considered
here
goatweed
comparatively
few
butterflies
are
confined
so
closely
to
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
river
as
the
goatweed
emperor
from
southern
illinois
south
to
the
gulf
this
insect
is
rather
abundant
in
many
localities
where
its
food
plant
the
goatweed
is
common
the
of
the
insect
was
carefully
studied
by
riley
and
one
of
the
best
accounts
was
published
in
one
of
his
early
reports
on
the
insects
of
missouri
the
excellent
illustrations
in
that
article
first
made
the
species
familiar
to
many
students
briefly
summarized
the
runs
something
like
this
the
butterflies
hibernate
coming
forth
in
spring
and
visiting
various
spring
and
early
summer
flowers
the
females
deposit
eggs
singly
upon
the
leaves
of
the
young
goatweed
plants
in
a
week
or
less
each
egg
hatches
into
a
little
caterpillar
that
feeds
upon
the
tip
of
the
leaf
leaving
the
midrib
and
covering
it
with
silk
so
that
it
may
serve
as
a
resting
perch
later
each
makes
an
excellent
tent
for
itself
by
bending
over
and
binding
together
the
opposite
margins
of
a
leaf
d
this
bit
of
work
is
cleverly
done
a
hole
being
left
at
each
end
so
that
there
is
good
ventilation
and
an
opportunity
for
the
caterpillar
to
go
in
and
out
quite
frequently
the
nest
is
also
lined
with
more
or
less
silken
webbing
this
tent
is
used
as
a
refuge
from
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
doubtless
serves
also
in
concealing
the
caterpillar
from
its
many
enemies
the
larva
goes
out
to
neighboring
leaves
when
it
wishes
to
feed
and
only
occasionally
eats
up
the
leaf
of
which
its
tent
is
made
when
this
is
done
it

goatweed
butterfly
larva
chrysalis
larval
case
after
riley
the
caterpillar
is
an
inch
and
a
half
long
and
of
a
general
grayish
color
dotted
thickly
with
slightly
elevated
points
the
chrysalis
is
suggestive
of
that
of
the
monarch
butterfly
it
is
light
green
covered
with
whitish
granules
the
adult
butterfly
is
remarkable
for
the
falcate
shape
of
the
outer
margin
of
each
front
wing
and
the
broad
tail
at
the
hind
outer
angle
of
each
hind
wing
in
the
male
the
upper
surface
of
all
the
wings
is
of
a
dark
orange
tone
with
a
rather
narrow
brown
marginal
marking
in
the
female
this
marginal
band
is
broader
and
is
nearly
paralleled
by
another
narrower
band
a
little
nearer
the
body
in
bright
sunshine
there
is
a
distinct
purplish
red
iridescence
over
practically
the
whole
upper
surface
the
under
side
of
both
wings
is
of
a
color
to
suggest
a
dead
brown
leaf
with
a
purplish
iridescence
in
certain
angles
of
light
gray
this
very
distinctive
butterfly
is
found
in
the
southern
states
at
least
as
far
west
as
the
mississippi
valley
it
extends
north
to
indiana
and
ohio
and
probably
occurs
quite
generally
from
ohio
eastward
this
species
is
distinguished
by
the
general
or
coloring
of
the
wing
surfaces
heavily
marked
with
a
much
darker
dusky
brown
and
with
many
irregular
white
spots
as
well
as
one
large
on
each
front
wing
near
the
border
and
a
row
of
seven
more
or
less
distinct
near
the
border
of
each
hind
wing
like
the
tawny
emperor
this
species
feeds
in
the
larval
state
upon
the
leaves
of
hackberry
in
missouri
the
butterflies
appear
in
june
a
little
later
they
lay
eggs
upon
the
under
side
of
the
hackberry
leaves
commonly
one
in
a
place
but
sometimes
several
side
by
side
a
few
days
later
these
eggs
hatch
into
little
yellow
caterpillars
that
feed
upon
the
leaves
for
about
a
month
when
they
become
full
grown
they
are
then
a
little
more
than
an
inch
long
of
a
general
light
green
color
with
yellow
spots
along
the
middle
of
the
back
and
three
yellow
lines
along
each
side
the
head
has
a
pair
of
curious
antlers
much
like
those
of
the
caterpillar
of
the
tawny
emperor
these
caterpillars
now
spin
a
bit
of
silken
web
on
the
under
side
of
the
leaf
or
twig
they
attach
their
hind
legs
into
this
web
and
hang
downward
for
a
day
or
two
before
casting
the
last
larval
skin
and
changing
to
chrysalids
they
change
again
to
butterflies
which
are
seen
upon
the
wing
early
in
august
these
butterflies
lay
eggs
in
turn
on
the
hackberry
leaves
the
eggs
soon
hatching
into
small
caterpillars
which
according
to
riley
observations
are
less
active
than
those
of
the
earlier
brood
these
caterpillars
feed
for
a
few
weeks
until
they
become
nearly
half
grown
and
have
passed
their
second
or
possibly
their
third
moult
they
now
stop
eating
and
get
ready
for
a
long
fast
through
the
winter
apparently
some
of
them
at
least
attach
themselves
to
the
under
side
of
the
hackberry
leaves
and
turn
to
a
brownish
color
remaining
upon
the
leaves
until
the
latter
fall
to
the
ground
and
presumably
hibernating
in
the
shelter
thus
provided
whether
or
not
all
of
the
caterpillars
have
this
rather
curious
habit
seems
to
be
doubtful
it
has
been
suggested
that
some
of
them
find
shelter
within
the
crevices
in
the
rough
bark
of
the
tree
at
any
rate
the
caterpillars
remain
in
a
sort
of
stupor
until
the
following
spring
then
they
awaken
climb
up
the
trees
or
bushes
and
begin
feeding
upon
the
young
leaves
they
continue
this
until
they
become
full
grown
in
may
when
they
change
to
chrysalids
to
emerge
as
the
first
brood
of
butterflies
the
following
month
many
of
the
caterpillars
make
a
sort
of
nest
for
themselves
by
spinning
a
web
of
silk
upon
the
under
surface
of
the
leaf
and
drawing
together
slightly
the
outer
edges
as
is
the
case
with
so
many
other
butterflies
that
hibernate
as
caterpillars
apparently
the
species
is
only
partially
some
of
the
earlier
caterpillars
become
lethargic
when
half
grown
and
remain
in
that
condition
throughout
the
later
weeks
of
summer
and
all
through
the
fall
and
winter
tawny
this
handsome
butterfly
is
easily
distinguished
from
the
gray
emperor
by
the
general
reddish
color
of
the
wings
which
are
thickly
marked
with
bands
and
of
darker
brown
or
black
the
are
especially
marked
on
the
hind
wing
there
being
a
row
of
five
of
these
on
each
hind
wing
in
both
sexes
the
females
are
decidedly
larger
than
the
male
and
generally
of
a
distinctly
lighter
color
this
butterfly
is
a
southern
species
found
more
or
less
abundantly
from
southern
new
york
to
northern
florida
and
across
the
country
to
a
line
drawn
from
iowa
to
texas
it
seems
to
be
more
common
in
the
mississippi
valley
than
in
other
regions
and
its
was
first
thoroughly
worked
out
in
missouri
and
published
in
one
of
riley
classic
reports
on
the
insects
of
that
state
it
has
since
been
studied
by
edwards
and
others
but
even
now
there
seems
to
be
some
uncertainty
in
regard
to
many
points
in
its
development
notably
the
number
of
broods
in
different
localities
and
the
habits
of
the
larvae
when
preparing
for
hibernation
the
principal
points
in
the
of
the
species
may
be
outlined
as
follows
some
time
in
july
the
eggs
are
laid
on
the
leaves
of
hackberry
in
dense
clusters
each
of
which
may
contain
from
two
hundred
to
five
hundred
eggs
these
are
usually
deposited
in
two
or
more
layers
one
upon
another
a
little
more
than
a
week
later
these
eggs
hatch
each
caterpillar
eating
through
one
end
in
a
way
to
cut
out
the
rim
of
a
tiny
cap
which
is
pushed
up
as
the
larva
escapes
the
whole
brood
emerges
at
practically
the
same
time
and
collects
upon
one
or
more
leaves
where
they
begin
to
feed
upon
the
succulent
green
tissues
like
so
many
caterpillars
that
feed
in
companies
each
spins
a
silken
thread
wherever
it
goes
the
little
larvae
remain
together
until
after
the
third
moult
at
which
time
they
are
about
half
grown
in
the
more
northern
regions
where
they
are
found
they
are
now
likely
to
scatter
about
in
search
of
quarters
for
hibernation
having
found
suitable
shelter
they
remain
through
the
winter
to
come
forth
early
the
following
spring
and
feed
upon
the
developing
leaves
of
the
hackberry
trees
they
continue
to
do
this
for
a
few
weeks
before
they
become
full
grown
they
are
then
greenish
worms
about
an
inch
and
a
half
long
striped
longitudinally
in
yellow
and
brown
the
hind
end
of
the
body
is
forked
in
a
curious
fashion
and
the
head
is
even
more
remarkable
for
the
strange
pair
of
tiny
antlers
projecting
from
it
these
caterpillars
soon
change
to
pale
green
chrysalids
lightly
striped
with
longitudinal
lines
of
yellow
with
a
distinctly
pointed
head
from
these
chrysalids
butterflies
emerge
early
in
summer
evidently
in
the
more
southern
states
there
are
two
broods
of
these
butterflies
each
year
but
there
is
great
need
of
more
precise
knowledge
in
regard
to
them
as
is
the
case
with
so
many
other
butterflies
there
is
a
dimorphic
form
called
in
which
the
outer
half
of
the
hind
wing
is
very
dark
brown
with
the
showing
as
black
with
circles
of
the
or

outer
angle
of
each
front
wing
projecting
into
a
falcate
tip

angle
of
each

the
form
one
of
the
most
distinctive
family
groups
among
all
the
butterfly
tribes
they
are
characterized
at
least
so
far
as
our
eastern
species
are
concerned
by
their
slender
bodies
and
rather
large
wings
toned
in
various
shades
of
brown
and
marked
chiefly
with
conspicuous
and
characteristic
the
larger
veins
of
the
front
wings
are
swollen
at
the
base
the
caterpillars
are
rather
slender
and
have
a
curious
division
of
the
last
body
segment
into
two
parts
which
gives
them
an
appearance
suggestive
of
the
caterpillar
of
the
emperor
butterflies
although
the
caterpillars
do
not
have
upon
the
head
the
curious
antlers
borne
by
the
emperor
larvae
common
or
in
the
development
of
our
knowledge
of
both
birds
and
mammals
as
found
upon
the
american
continent
the
experience
in
many
cases
has
been
essentially
this
a
bird
or
a
mammal
was
first
described
from
some
region
of
north
america
commonly
from
specimens
carried
to
europe
by
early
voyagers
later
other
species
of
the
same
genus
were
brought
to
light
by
various
explorers
and
given
specific
names
as
each
section
was
thus
explored
a
new
form
differing
markedly
from
the
others
was
found
and
named
at
a
later
period
when
great
collections
were
brought
together
so
that
one
observer
was
able
to
make
a
careful
survey
of
specimens
from
all
parts
of
the
continent
it
was
found
that
many
of
these
species
merged
into
each
other
through
intergrading
forms
from
regions
between
the
localities
of
the
original
species
so
it
has
come
about
that
in
the
case
of
a
large
number
of
our
birds
and
mammals
we
have
geographical
races
distinctly
recognized
instead
of
separate
species
while
the
study
of
butterflies
has
by
no
means
received
the
degree
of
attention
which
has
been
given
the
birds
and
mammals
it
is
already
evident
that
a
similar
condition
prevails
with
reference
to
many
species
as
the
size
of
collections
has
increased
and
more
careful
studies
have
been
made
of
the
various
forms
from
different
regions
it
has
been
found
in
numerous
cases
that
they
intergraded
to
so
great
an
extent
that
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
many
species
which
were
formerly
considered
entirely
distinct
one
of
the
most
striking
examples
of
this
is
found
in
the
case
of
our
common
which
is
sometimes
called
the
grayling
the
form
which
is
one
of
our
most
abundant
butterflies
in
southern
new
england
and
many
of
the
eastern
states
was
described
as
by
the
french
naturalist
fabricius
who
also
described
another
species
from
the
southern
states
as
and
a
form
found
in
northern
canada
was
described
by
the
english
entomologist
kirby
as
various
other
forms
from
isolated
regions
have
been
given
specific
names
by
other
authorities
plate
page
during
recent
years
many
collectors
have
gathered
these
butterflies
from
all
parts
of
north
america
and
many
specimens
have
been
grouped
together
in
the
more
important
collections
when
this
occurred
it
became
easy
to
see
that
this
is
essentially
a
variable
species
which
under
varying
climatic
conditions
has
assumed
slightly
different
forms
so
that
we
have
a
good
illustration
of
geographical
races
the
more
important
of
these
are
indicated
in
the
synopsis
of
the
on
page
similar
one
good
indication
that
these
varying
forms
all
have
a
common
origin
is
found
in
the
remarkable
unity
of
their
it
is
essentially
the
same
in
all
the
mother
butterflies
lay
eggs
late
in
summer
upon
the
leaves
of
grasses
and
perhaps
other
plants
about
three
weeks
later
these
eggs
hatch
into
small
caterpillars
that
immediately
become
lethargic
and
begin
their
hibernating
condition
without
eating
any
vegetation
they
remain
thus
fasting
until
spring
when
after
the
weather
warms
up
sufficiently
they
begin
to
feed
upon
grasses
and
perhaps
other
herbage
but
they
have
lots
of
time
in
which
to
complete
their
growth
and
they
are
very
moderate
in
their
eating
and
their
movements
they
grow
slowly
so
that
they
do
not
become
mature
as
caterpillars
until
june
they
then
change
to
chrysalids
to
emerge
as
butterflies
during
july
and
august
the
female
butterflies
remain
upon
the
wing
for
some
weeks
before
they
begin
to
lay
their
eggs
we
thus
have
in
this
case
an
adaptation
to
in
practically
all
stages
of
the
insect
life
the
twelve
months
of
the
year
must
be
passed
and
egg
larva
chrysalis
and
butterfly
each
seems
to
try
to
do
its
part
in
prolonging
its
period
of
life
these
butterflies
are
especially
common
along
streams
and
near
the
borders
of
woods
as
well
as
in
upland
pastures
and
meadows
they
are
interesting
creatures
with
characteristic
manner
of
flight
they
are
by
no
means
so
easy
to
capture
as
one
might
think
who
sees
them
apparently
going
with
slow
erratic
motions
from
flower
to
flower
denton
a
collector
of
long
experience
has
written
this
interesting
paragraph
upon
this
point
as
the
flight
of
these
insects
is
weak
they
have
been
obliged
to
resort
to
a
number
of
tricks
to
outwit
their
enemies
in
capturing
these
butterflies
the
collector
will
very
soon
become
acquainted
with
their
modes
of
escape
which
are
very
interesting
and
show
no
small
amount
of
cunning
scarcely
to
be
looked
for
in
an
innocent
little
butterfly
their
first
plan
of
escape
on
being
disturbed
is
to
make
directly
for
a
clump
of
bushes
into
the
thickest
part
of
which
they
dive
and
there
remain
until
the
danger
is
past
if
one
is
startled
from
the
grass
at
some
distance
from
a
safe
retreat
and
the
collector
overtakes
him
he
will
immediately
dodge
backward
and
forward
at
one
time
high
in
air
and
again
low
down
near
the
grass
tops
and
in
spite
of
his
slow
flight
keeping
well
clear
of
the
net
if
the
net
is
at
last
brought
very
close
to
him
he
will
try
his
last
desperate
scheme
to
elude
his
pursuer
and
shutting
his
wings
quickly
together
will
drop
into
the
grass
disappearing
as
if
by
magic
if
it
were
not
for
the
cunning
of
the
frail
little
creatures
they
would
doubtless
have
gone
to
the
wall
long
ago
in
the
struggle
for
existence
southern
this
large
southern
butterfly
is
sufficiently
distinct
from
the
other
to
rank
as
a
separate
species
the
yellow
blotch
has
expanded
into
a
large
band
extending
practically
across
the
front
wings
on
its
upper
surface
there
is
one
in
the
male
and
two
in
the
female
it
is
abundant
in
the
extreme
southern
states
and
has
occasionally
been
taken
much
farther
north
pearly
most
butterflies
are
creatures
of
open
country
basking
freely
in
the
sunshine
and
visiting
flowers
of
many
sorts
for
their
nectar
food
some
of
them
are
found
at
times
along
the
borders
of
woods
and
others
seek
the
woods
especially
in
autumn
for
the
purpose
of
hibernation
this
exquisite
pearly
eye
however
is
distinctly
a
woodland
species
being
found
only
in
little
glades
in
the
midst
of
woods
and
apparently
seldom
even
seeking
flowers
for
their
nectar
it
is
commonly
considered
one
of
the
rarest
of
american
butterflies
but
many
collectors
who
have
searched
their
regions
carefully
have
been
able
to
find
small
areas
in
which
the
butterfly
is
quite
abundant
in
such
situations
it
may
be
looked
for
in
all
parts
of
the
united
states
east
of
the
western
limits
of
the
mississippi
valley
and
south
of
canada

perhaps
the
lower
part
of

northern
regions

shortly
before
midsummer

continue
on

at

part
of

weeks
after
the
butterflies
emerge

apparently
hibernate

well
grown

the
following

emerge
as
butterflies
in
early
summer
these
pearly
eyes
have
certain
characteristics

are

interest
no
other
species
presents
such
exquisite
modulation
of
brown
coloring
arranged
in
beautiful
circles
upon
both
surfaces

the
males
possess
perhaps
to
a
greater
degree
than
any
other
of
our
native
butterflies
the
ability
to
give
off
a
peculiar
pleasant
aroma
which
is
noticeable
whenever
the
insects
are
collected
and
which
at
least
one
careful
observer
has
been
able
to
detect
in
the
open
air

near
for
many
years
fiske
made
a
special
study
of
the
butterflies
prevailing
in
the
region
of
webster
new
hampshire
his
word
picture
of
the
haunts
of
the
pearly
eye
is
more
adequate
than
any
other
which
has
been
published
and
seems
well
worth
quoting
in
this
connection
i
have
found
them
in
several
localities
always
in
some
numbers
but
nowhere
more
abundant
than
in
a
little
wooded
glen
in
webster
here
a
scattering
group
of
tall
pines
a
few
thick
hemlocks
and
a
young
growth
of
miscellaneous
deciduous
trees
fill
up
the
space
between
two
rather
steep
banks
a
small
trout
brook
follows
close
by
one
of
these
banks
and
near
the
lower
end
of
the
glen
in
a
space
kept
clear
of
underbrush
by
the
overshadowing
influence
of
the
pines
and
hemlocks
is
a
little
spring
the
overflow
from
which
keeps
the
ground
moist
for
some
space
on
each
side
of
the
channel
which
it
follows
to
the
brook
this
is
the
great
meeting
place
of
these
butterflies
here
they
may
be
seen
at
almost
any
time
in
the
day
except
in
the
early
morning
when
they
seek
the
outskirts
of
the
woods
until
the
shades
of
evening
render
their
flitting
forms
indistinguishable
up
the
bank
on
one
side
half
shrouded
in
the
dense
growth
of
underbrush
which
is
springing
up
around
it
is
an
old
apple
tree
upon
which
the
sapsuckers
work
yearly
the
wounded
limbs
dripping
with
sap
are
frequented
by
many
forms
of
insect
life
most
noticeable
among
them
this
butterfly
and
such
refreshment
added
to
the
moisture
which
they
suck
from
the
margin
of
the
spring
is
all
that
i
have
ever
seen
them
partake
eyed
for
delicacy
of
color
tones
few
butterflies
can
compare
with
this
exquisite
creature
it
seems
indeed
to
have
succeeded
in
a
modest
attempt
to
obliterate
itself
for
even
when
the
spread
wings
are
placed
against
a
clear
white
background
they
can
scarcely
be
called
conspicuous
and
it
is
very
probable
that
when
the
butterfly
is
at
rest
in
its
native
haunts
with
wings
closed
together
so
that
only
the
very
delicate
light
brown
of
the
under
surface
are
revealed
it
actually
becomes
invisible
the
upper
surface
of
the
wings
is
broadly
washed
with
a
color
which
runs
into
a
suggestion
of
a
lighter
band
near
the
outer
margin
of
the
front
pair
the
upper
surface
of
the
hind
wings
is
almost
uniformly
washed
with
this
same
brown
color
which
is
interrupted
only
by
very
fine
double
lines
at
the
outer
margin
and
a
row
of
delicate
which
are
larger
than
the
somewhat
similar
row
of
on
the
front
wings
the
under
surface
is
much
lighter
in
color
with
distinct
striations
extending
across
the
main
surface
of
both
wings
from
front
to
back
and
with
some
very
attractive
arranged
as
a
series
each
with
a
central
white
eye
this
is
distinctly
a
northern
species
having
rather
a
limited
range
in
canada
and
new
england
it
extends
south
to
pennsylvania
and
ohio
and
westward
to
wisconsin
and
iowa
it
is
more
abundant
in
northern
than
in
southern
new
england
but
it
is
often
overlooked
by
collectors
who
are
not
familiar
with
its
haunts
it
is
especially
likely
to
be
found
among
the
tall
grass
of
swamps
and
brooks
running
through
lowlands
one
of
the
best
ways
to
discover
it
is
to
beat
the
grasses
in
such
situations
the
of
the
eyed
brown
is
fairly
well
known
the
eggs
are
laid
chiefly
on
grasses
and
probably
at
times
upon
the
sedges
the
larvae
feed
upon
these
plants
and
become
nearly
full
grown
before
winter
sets
in
they
then
hibernate
in
this
larval
stage
and
the
following
spring
complete
their
growth
and
change
to
chrysalids
in
time
for
the
butterflies
to
emerge

white

norna
to
appreciate
the
extraordinary
distribution
of
this
notable
species
one
must
let
his
fancy
carry
him
back
a
million
years
or
so
until
he
reaches
that
old
time
when
the
whole
northern
part
of
the
american
continent
was
covered
with
an
icy
coating
then
he
must
follow
the
gradual
retreating
of
the
ice
northward
carrying
with
it
wonderful
changes
in
climate
and
along
with
these
climatic
changes
taking
northward
many
plants
and
animals
which
were
adapted
to
the
cool
temperature
along
the
borders
of
the
glacier
as
the
ice
cap
retreated
most
of
these
arctic
forms
retreated
with
it
and
all
along
the
lower
levels
they
were
replaced
by
others
migrating
from
the
south
so
that
gradually
there
came
about
the
distribution
of
plants
and
animals
as
we
find
them
when
however
the
glaciers
left
the
higher
elevations
of
the
white
mountains
and
the
rocky
mountains
there
were
at
the
summits
small
areas
in
which
the
climatic
conditions
were
of
very
much
the
same
arctic
character
as
prevailed
along
the
margin
of
the
ice
cap
consequently
conditions
were
here
favorable
for
the
continuation
of
many
of
the
arctic
species
which
had
disappeared
from
the
warmer
lower
levels
it
was
as
if
we
had
a
great
sea
of
air
of
a
certain
warmth
and
rising
above
this
the
islands
of
the
mountain
tops
these
islands
retaining
the
same
arctic
features
as
otherwise
are
found
much
farther
northward
among
the
animals
thus
left
stranded
by
the
retreating
ice
cap
this
white
mountain
butterfly
has
perhaps
attracted
the
most
attention
from
scientists
it
is
a
butterfly
of
moderate
size
which
shows
in
every
phase
of
its
structure
and
its
the
results
of
the
long
process
of
adaptation
to
its
unique
environment
it
has
been
carefully
studied
by
many
observers
and
has
been
considered
one
of
the
most
desirable
trophies
by
every
collector
of
insects
as
a
result
notwithstanding
its
isolation
and
the
difficulty
of
studying
it
its
is
better
known
than
that
of
many
a
common
and
widely
distributed
species
to
appreciate
the
facts
in
regard
to
the
structure
and
life
of
this
butterfly
one
must
know
that
its
habitat
is
confined
to
a
thousand
feet
or
so
at
the
summits
of
the
mountain
that
in
this
area
there
are
no
trees
or
even
shrubs
worth
mentioning
and
that
the
surface
of
the
mountain
is
covered
with
rocks
between
which
grow
a
few
stunted
sedges
and
over
which
grows
the
reindeer
moss
it
is
a
bleak
bare
gray
environment
constantly
swept
by
terrific
winds
where
snow
is
seen
in
august
and
is
likely
to
remain
until
june
so
the
summer
season
is
of
briefest
duration
and
the
climatic
conditions
are
so
severe
that
one
can
only
wonder
how
a
fragile
creature
like
a
butterfly
is
able
to
survive
the
twelve
long
months
and
from
a
first
glance
at
the
mottled
wings
of
these
insects
one
would
guess
that
here
was
a
distinctive
example
of
obliterative
coloring
and
it
is
true
as
all
observers
testify
that
when
the
butterfly
lights
upon
the
stones
and
turns
sideways
as
apparently
it
does
habitually
in
deference
to
the
force
of
the
wind
it
becomes
very
difficult
to
see
for
the
wings
are
closed
and
only
the
rounded
mottled
under
surface
shows
it
appears
also
to
have
the
habit
of
some
of
the
graylings
when
hard
pushed
of
simply
closing
its
wings
and
dropping
to
the
ground
feigning
death
in
deference
also
to
the
winds
its
flight
is
just
above
the
surface
doubtless
if
it
rose
high
in
the
air
it
would
be
swept
away
to
lower
regions
where
evidently
it
is
unable
to
survive
for
long
periods

these
butterflies
appear
early
in
july
and
continue
on
the
wing
for
several
weeks
they
lay
their
small
eggs
upon
or
near
a
species
of
sedge
which
is
abundant
on
these
alpine
summits
about
two
weeks
later
the
eggs
hatch
into
sluggish
little
caterpillars
which
feed
upon
the
sedge
leaves
apparently
eating
only
at
night
and
hiding
in
crevices
between
stones
by
day
as
one
would
expect
from
the
prevailing
low
temperatures
these
caterpillars
grow
very
slowly
and
apparently
a
large
proportion
of
them
require
two
years
to
complete
their
development
there
seems
to
be
some
uncertainty
in
regard
to
this
phase
of
the
insect
but
most
entomologists
are
of
the
opinion
that
some
of
the
butterflies
mature
in
one
year
while
others
require
two
years
that
is
the
broods
are
both
annual
and
biennial
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
insect
hibernates
as
a
caterpillar
and
if
this
statement
about
the
number
of
broods
is
correct
some
of
the
caterpillars
hibernate
when
very
small
and
recently
hatched
from
the
egg
while
others
hibernate
when
nearly
full
grown
the
caterpillars
change
to
chrysalids
beneath
the
shelter
of
the

practically
the

sorts
of
situation
which
they
have
chosen
for
hiding
at
night
or
for
hibernation
through
the
winter
here
without
any
button
of
silk
or
silken
loop
and
with
scarcely
a
suggestion
of
a
silken
cocoon
they
change
to
chrysalids
generally
about
the
first
of
june
they
remain
in
this
condition
for
perhaps
three
or
four
weeks
when
they
come
forth
as
butterflies
arctic
norna
this
is
another
butterfly
of
decided
interest
because
of
its
geographical
distribution
it
is
normally
an
inhabitant
of
the
far
north
extending
around
the
north
pole
over
parts
of
three
continents
apparently
the
only
place
in
the
united
states
where
it
occurs
is
a
bog
a
little
north
of
bangor
maine
this
locality
is
called
the
bog
and
is
the
only
place
where
collectors
have
been
able
to
find
this
species
an
even
more
local
insect
is
another
of
these
mountain
butterflies
found
by
newcomb
on
mount
katahdin
maine
so
far
as
known
this
species
is
confined
to
the
higher
portion
of
this
mountain
and
so
is
even
more
distinctly
localized
than
the
white
mountain
butterfly
it
is
called
the

this

creature
has
well
been
named
the

satyr
although
under
our
modern
conditions
it
is
often
found
in
fields
and
along
hedgeroads
rather
than
in
the
woods
it
has
to
a
marked
degree
the
delicacy
of
structure
of
its
allies
and
its
small
size
serves
to
emphasize
this
appearance
it
has
also
a
rather
general
distribution
west
to
the

from
the
corner
of
dakota
south
through
nebraska

it
occupies
the
whole
of
the
united
states
east
and
south
of
the
lines
thus
indicated
the
of
this
species
is
very
similar
to
the
common
grayling
the
butterflies
appear
in
early
summer
deposit
their
eggs
upon
grasses
and
the
resulting
larvae
feed
upon
the
grasses
and
grow
slowly
through
the
weeks
of
summer
they
become
nearly
full
grown
by
autumn
and
hibernate
in
this
condition
in
such
shelter
as
they
can
find
at
the
soil
surface
the
following
spring
they
come
forth
probably
feeding
for
a
short
time
and
change
to
chrysalids
in
time
to
emerge
as
butterflies
in
may
and
early
june
practically
all
observers
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
butterflies
are
abundant
only
late
in
spring
or
early
in
summer
generally
disappearing
before
the
middle
of

the

family
this
is
a
tropical
family
with
only
a
single
species
migrating
northward
to
our
southern

the
butterflies
of
this
group
are
characterized
by
having
the
wings
so
long
and
narrow
that
their
length
is
usually
twice
as
great
as
their
width
the
front
legs
in
both

are
so
poorly
developed
that
they
are
considered
a
modification
approaching
the
complete
dwarfing
found
in
the
butterflies

while
the
butterflies
of
temperate
north
america
show
many
examples
of
marvelous
beauty
and
coloring
one
must
go
to
the
tropics
to
see
the
culmination
of
what
nature
has
done
in
painting
the
outstretched

of
butterfly

gorgeous
colors
the
great
butterfly
tribes
that
swarm
in
tropical
forests
seldom
reach
our
temperate
clime

even
when
they
do
they
are
likely
to
show
only
a
suggestion
of
the
splendid
size
and
rich
coloring
to
be
seen
farther
south
the
zebra
butterfly
belongs
to
one
of
these
tropical
tribes
it
shows
its
affinities
by
its
coloring
and
the
curious
shape
of
its
wings
in
most
of
our
northern
butterflies
the
wings
are
about
as
long
as
they
are
wide
but
in
the
tropical
family
they
are
very
much
longer
than
wide
this
gives
the
insect
an
entirely
different
look
from
our
common
forms
so
that
one
recognizes
it
at
once
as
a
stranger
within
our
gates
indeed
it
does
not
penetrate
far
into
our
region
being
found
commonly
only
in
florida
and
one
or
two
other
neighboring
states
its
principal
home
being
in
tropical
america
the
zebra
butterfly
is
well
named
across
the
brownish
black
wings
there
runs
a
series
of
yellow
stripes
three
on
each
front
wing
and
one
on
each
hind
wing
with
a
row
of
white
spots
on
each
of
the
latter
the
under
surface
is
much
like
the
upper
except
that
the
coloring
is
distinctly
paler
it
is
very
variable
in
size
some
specimens
may
be
but

the

or
less
marked
with
brownish
black
spots
arranged
in
transverse
rows
and
partially
covered
with

spines
they
change
to

which
are
remarkable
for
their
irregular
shape
with
two
projections
on
the
head
which
the
insect
can
move
in
a
most
curious
fashion
one
of
the
most
notable
things
about
this
insect
is
the
fact
that
the
male
butterflies
are
attracted
to
the
chrysalids
of
the
females
even
before
the
latter
emerge
many
observers
have
reported
upon
this
curious
phenomenon
and
have
recorded
experiments
demonstrating
that
it
is
a
general
habit
with
the
species
roosting
the
adult
butterflies
flock
together
at
night
and
rest
upon
the
spanish
moss
which
festoons
so
many
of
the
trees
in
the
far
south
or
upon
dead
branches
they
take
positions
with
heads
upward
and
wings
closed
many
of
them
often
flocking
together
to
roost
and
wandering
out
to
the
fields
when
the
morning
sun
gives
them
renewed
activity
but
these
butterflies
are
essentially
forest
insects
reliable
observers
have
noticed
that
when
one
emerges
from
a
chrysalis
it
flies
up
in
the
air
and
makes
straight
for
the
nearest
woods
others
have
noticed
that
when
a
butterfly
in
a
field
is
alarmed
it
also
makes
for
the
woods
and
in
the
regions
where
the
species
is
abundant
the
butterflies
are
most
likely
to
be
found
in
paths
and
glades
in
the
forest
thus
they
show
the
influence
of
their
ancestral
habitat
in
the
tropical
wilderness
there
seems
to
be
a
certain
amount
of
ceremony
attending
the
flocking
together
at
night
for
roosting
purposes
a
famous
english
naturalist
philip
henry
gosse
saw
the
performance
in
the
west
indies
many
years
ago
and
described
it
in
these
words
passing
along
a
rocky
on
a
steep
wooded
mountain
side
in
the
parish
of
elizabeth
jamaica
about
the
end
of
august
my
attention
was
attracted
just
before
sunset
by
a
swarm
of
these
butterflies
in
a
sort
of
rocky
recess
overhung
by
trees
and
creepers
they
were
about
twenty
in
number
and
were
dancing
to
and
fro
exactly
in
the
manner
of
gnats
or
as
play
at
the
side
of
a
wood
after
watching
them
awhile
i
noticed
that
some
of
them
were
resting
with
closed
wings
at
the
extremities
of
one
or
two
depending
vines
one
after
another
fluttered
from
the
group
of
dancers
to
the
reposing
squadron
and
alighted
close
to
the
others
so
that
at
length
when
only
two
or
three
of
the
fliers
were
left
the
rest
were
collected
in
groups
of
half
a
dozen
each
so
close
together
that
each
group
might
have
been
grasped
in
the
hand
when
once
one
had
alighted
it
did
not
in
general
fly
again
but
a
fluttering
at
the
group
seeking
to
find
a
place
sometimes
disturbed
one
recently
settled
when
the
wings
were
thrown
open
and
one
or
two
flew
up
again
as
there
were
no
leaves
on
the
hanging
stalks
the
appearance
presented
by
these
beautiful
butterflies
so
crowded
together
their
long
erect
wings
pointing
in
different
directions
was
not
a
little
curious
i
was
told
by
persons
residing
near
that
every
evening
they
thus
assembled
and
that
i
had
not
seen
a
third
part
of
the
numbers
often
collected
in
that
spot
the
milkweed
butterflies
family
so
far
as
the
great
majority
of
readers
of
this
book
are
concerned
this
family
includes
but
one
species
the
familiar
monarch
or
milkweed
butterfly
in
the
southern
states
there
is
another
the
queen
and
in
florida
still
a
third
the
distinguishing
characteristics
are
found
in
the
dwarfed
useless
front
legs
and
the
absence
of
scales
upon
the
antennae
from
june
until
october
one
may
often
see
the
stately
monarch
flitting
leisurely
about
over
fields
and
meadows
it
is
one
of
the
largest
and
most
distinctive
of
these
frail
children
of
the
air
and
may
be
easily
recognized
by
its
resemblance
to
the
picture
opposite
page
the
veins
of
the
wings
are
heavily
marked
in
black
with
large
white
dots
upon
the
black
bands
along
the
margin
the
color
of
the
rest
of
the
wings
both
above
and
below
is
reddish
brown
these
butterflies
come
from
the
south
in
spring
or
early
summer
they
find
milkweed
plants
and
lay
their
eggs
upon
the
leaves
these
eggs
soon
hatch
into
small
white
and
black
caterpillars
that
feed
upon
the
milkweed
leaves
and
grow
rapidly
one
is
likely
to
find
them
throughout
most
of
the
summer
wherever
a
milkweed
shows
partially
eaten
leaves
bring
in
the
caterpillars
place
them
in
an
open
vivarium
and
furnish
fresh
leaves
every
day
or
two
the
caterpillars
will
soon
mature
and
change
to
beautiful
green
chrysalids
with
golden
markings
this
chrysalis
has
been
called
the
glass
house
with
the
gold
nails
plates
pages
about
two
weeks
later
the
glass
house
will
burst
open
and
the
butterfly
emerge
it
will
rest
an
hour
or
two
while
its
wings
and
body
harden
and
then
it
will
want
to
fly
away
it
is
not
so
anxious
to
do
this
however
as
most
butterflies
if
one
is
kept
beneath
a
or
in
a
box
or
even
in
a
closed
room
and
fed
with
sweetened
water
it
will
soon
become
so
tame
that
it
will
perch
on
one
finger
and
suck
nectar
from
a
flower
held
in
hand
on
this
account
it
is
a
particularly
desirable
butterfly
for
the
amateur
photographer
to
cultivate
because
he
can
easily
get
many
interesting
and
beautiful
pictures
by
posing
the
butterfly
on
different
flowers
change
from
caterpillar
to
the
change
from
the
caterpillar
to
the
butterfly
is
easier
to
watch
in
this
species
than
in
most
others
the
caterpillar
spins
sometimes
on
the
under
surface
of
the
milkweed
leaf
sometimes
elsewhere
a
little
mat
of
silk
in
which
it
entangles
the
hooked
claws
of
its
hind
feet
then
it
lets
go
with
its
fore
feet
and
hangs
downward
with
the
front
end
of
its
body
curled
upward
in
this
position
it
remains
for
some
hours
perhaps
a
day
the
body
juices
gravitating
downward
and
causing
a
swollen
appearance
on
the
lower
segments
then
the
skin
splits
apart
and
is
wriggled
off
by
the
contortions
of
the
body
when
it
finally
drops
away
there
is
left
a
creature
broader
below
than
above
this
is
a
transition
stage
that
lasts
but
a
very
short
time
soon
the
form
is
entirely
changed
so
that
the
broadest
part
is
above
instead
of
below
the
definite
outline
of
the
chrysalis
is
soon
taken
on
the
outer
tissues
hardening
into
a
distinct
covering
the
insect
is
now
a
beautiful
green
with
wonderful
golden
spots
upon
its
surface
and
a
few
black
spots
just
below
the
black
cremaster
by
which
the
chrysalis
is
connected
with
the
web
of
silk
upon
the
leaf
in
this
quiet
chrysalis
the
insect
remains
for
nearly
a
fortnight
then
the
structure
of
the
forthcoming
butterfly
begins
to
show
through
the
thin
outer
covering
and
you
know
that
the
period
of
the
chrysalis
is
nearly
ended
if
you
keep
watch
you
will
probably
see
the
sudden
bursting
of
the
outer
envelope
and
the
quick
grasping
of
its
surface
by
the
legs
of
the
newly
emerged
butterfly
its
wings
at
first
are
short
and
crumpled
bearing
little
resemblance
to
those
of
the
fully
developed
butterfly
but
as
it
hangs
there
with
one
pair
of
legs
holding
to
the
empty
chrysalis
and
the
other
to
the
leaf
above
the
wings
rapidly
lengthen
hanging
limply
downward
and
the
body
juices
penetrate
the
veins
a
little
later
they
expand
in
the
other
direction
the
hind
wings
reaching
full
size
before
the
front
ones
do
finally
both
pairs
of
wings
are
fully
expanded
and
the
butterfly
is
likely
to
walk
to
the
top
of
the
support
where
it
rests
for
an
hour
or
two
while
its
tissues
harden
before
it
attempts
to
fly
in
early
autumn
out
of
doors
these
butterflies
start
southward
on
their
long
journey
they
often
gather
in
great
flocks
and
roost
at
night
on
wayside
shrubs
and
trees
at
this
season
it
is
easy
to
catch
them
in
an
insect
net
and
bring
them
indoors
for
pets
they
live
for
a
long
while
and
lend
interest
and
beauty
to
living
room
or
window
garden
to
the
photographer
they
offer
opportunities
for
attractive
indoor
pictures
plates
pages
the
general
form
and
color
patterns
of
this
fine
butterfly
show
at
once
that
it
is
related
to
the
monarch
its
general
colors
are
and
black
dotted
and
spotted
with
white
the
eggs
are
laid
upon
milkweed
and
the
is
much
like
that
of
the
monarch
one
of
the
most
interesting
facts
in
connection
with
this
species
is
that
it
seems
to
be
mimicked
by
the
vicereine
butterfly
in
the
same
way
that
the
monarch
is
mimicked
by
the
viceroy
the
snout

one
has
a
suggestion
of
hobson
choice
in
the
common

of

unique

snout
butterflies
does
not
seem
sufficiently
elegant
as
a
descriptive
phrase
for
such
delicate
creatures
he
can
call
them
the
until
he
sees
that
this
also
is
inadequate
as
a
matter
of
fact
both
are
misnomers
for
the
projection
from
the
head
that
gives
them
these
names
is
neither
a
snout
nor
a
beak
it
is
simply
a
pair
of
palpi
unusually
developed
which
perhaps
in
an
early
stage
of
butterfly
history
served
a
useful
purpose
at
present
however
they
serve
chiefly
to
set
the
few
owners
apart
from
the
other
butterflies
in
the
system
of
classification
although
possibly
they
may
also
serve
the
butterfly
by
helping
to
give
the
impression
of
a
leaf
attached
to
a
twig
plate
page
snout
there
is
a
peculiar
interest
in
any
form
of
animal
life
which
can
be
definitely
traced
far
back
through
the
geologic
ages
in
nearly
every
group
of
living
creatures
there
are
certain
types
which
scientists
have
found
were
once
abundant
but
which
now
are
on
the
wane
as
a
rule
these
are
better
represented
in
the
museums
through
fossil
species
than
by
those
now
living
to
a
considerable
extent
also
such
forms
are
likely
to
present
various
features
which
mark
their
primitive
condition
and
the
living
allies
have
peculiarities
which
set
them
off
as
distinct
from
those
of
their
own
relations
which
have
been
modeled
in
a
more
modern
fashion
among
the
mammals
the
curious
marsupials
of
which
our
southern
opossum
is
an
example
furnish
good
illustrations
of
this
general
truth
among
the
birds
the
curious
little
least
bittern
is
an
example
among
the
butterflies
the
strange
snout
butterfly
is
by
far
the
best
example
these
snout
butterflies
of
which
only
two
species
are
now
living
in
north
america
are
the
sole
representatives
with
us
of
the
family
or
the
only
one
of
these
species
occurs
to
any
extent
at
least
north
of
texas
it
is
the
curious
little
creature
called
the
snout
butterfly
it
has
a
strange
appearance
due
to
the
angular
outline
of
both
front
and
hind
wings
and
the
long
palpi
which
project
forward
from
the
head
in
a
way
to
attract
attention
the
common
name
is
due
to
these
projecting
palpi
even
the
coloring
is
primitive
the
general
tone
of
the
wings
being
blackish
brown
distinctly
marked
with
white
and
orange
spots
the
under
surface
is
less
primitive
in
its
coloring
being
toned
in
iridescent
grayish
brown
in
a
way
to
suggest
protective
coloring
except
in
that
part
of
each
front
wing
which
is
not
hidden
when
the
insect
is
at
rest
this
shows
the
white
and
markings
some
years
ago
there
were
found
in
certain
fossil
deposits
in
the
west
about
a
dozen
species
of
fossil
butterflies
it
is
strange
indeed
that
these
ethereal
creatures
should
be
fossilized
at
all
one
would
think
it
scarcely
possible
that
they
could
be
so
preserved
that
a
million
years
after
they
had
died
man
should
be
able
to
study
them
determine
to
what
families
they
belonged
and
even
guess
with
a
high
probability
of
accuracy
upon
what
leaves
their
caterpillars
fed
this
little
collection
of
fossil
butterflies
was
studied
by
one
of
the
great
american
authorities
on
living
butterflies
the
late
samuel
scudder
who
said
of
them
they
are
generally
preserved
in
such
fair
condition
that
the
course
of
the
nervures
and
the
color
patterns
of
the
wings
can
be
determined
and
even
in
one
case
the
scales
may
be
studied
as
a
rule
they
are
so
well
preserved
that
we
may
feel
nearly
as
confident
concerning
their
affinities
with
those
now
living
as
if
we
had
pinned
specimens
to
examine
and
generally
speaking
the
older
they
are
the
better
they
are
preserved
a
curious
fact
is
that
out
of
the
comparatively
few
species
of
these
fossil
butterflies
two
were
easily
recognized
as
members
of
this
family
they
were
given
special
scientific
names
and
undoubtedly
were
closely
related
to
the
snout
butterfly
which
is
still
flying
every
year
in
various
parts
of
the
united
states
our
modern
species
lays
its
eggs
upon
the
leaves
of
hackberry
and
in
these
geologic
deposits
of
that
era
there
have
been
found
leaves
of
old
hackberry
trees
upon
which
it
is
extremely
probable
that
the
caterpillars
of
these
ancient
fed
what
an
opportunity
for
a
modern
collector
of
butterflies
to
work
his
fancy
as
he
thinks
of
those
old
times
when
these
fossil
creatures
were
flying
in
the
sunshine
depositing
their
eggs
upon
the
leaves
of
trees
that
made
up
landscape
pictures
probably
very
different
from
those
of
and
how
he
wonders
what
flowers
these
butterflies
visited
for
their
nectar
food
what
birds
chased
them
from
tree
to
tree
and
what
mammals
wandered
through
those
ancient
forests
what
a
suggestion
also
it
gives
of
the
continuity
of
life
upon
our
old
earth
to
realize
that
these
butterflies
of
are
carrying
on
their
brief
existence
in
practically
the
same
way
that
these
forbears
of
theirs
did
so
many
millions
of
years
ago
another
way
in
which
these
butterflies
are
peculiar
is
the
fact
that
the
females
have
six
legs
while
the
males
have
only
four
as
already
indicated
the
caterpillars
feed
upon
hackberry
when
full
grown
they
are
about
an
inch
long
dark
green
striped
with
yellow
with
two
blackish
tubercules
on
the
second
ring
behind
the
head
they
apparently
pass
the
winter
in
the
chrysalis
stage
the
butterflies
are
likely
to
be
found
along
the
borders
of
brooks
or
streams
running
through
woods
or
along
the
margins
of
the
forest
occasionally
they
become
abundant
in
certain
localities
but
on
the
whole
they
are
rare
and
highly
prized
by
collectors
the
family
this
small
family
of
very
small
butterflies
contains
five
genera
and
a
dozen
species
found
in
the
united
states
and
mexico
only
two
however
occur
in
the
eastern
region
and
only
one
extends
much
north
of
the
gulf
states
aside
from
certain
peculiarities
of
the
a
costal
and
a
humeral
vein
on
the
hind
wings
these
may
be
known
by
their
minuteness
and
the
bright
metallic
markings
on
the
brown
wings
both
our
eastern
species
belong
to
the
genus
the
small

been
collected
in
florida
and
georgia
the
wings
are
rusty
red
on
both
surfaces
brighter
below
than
above
and
marked
with
blackish
spots
that
almost
converge
to
form
stripes
in
addition
to
which
there
are
beyond
the
middle
of
each
wing
two
lines
made
by
special
scales
that
glisten

about
three

as
i
can

the

never
been
described
the
large
is
called
by
science
but
it
deserves
the
latter
name
only
in
the
sense
that
it
is
more
northern
than
its
allies
it
has
been
collected
as
far
north
as
new

and
michigan
but
it
seems
to
be
very
seldom
found
at
least
in
eastern
regions
it
expands
a
little
more
than
an
inch
the
general
color
of

moving
them
backward

forward

fixed

the
fine

extend

is

a
very
interesting
suggestion
in
regard
to
the
possible
function
of
the
curious
tail
projections
was
made
nearly
a
hundred
years
ago
by
some
english
entomologists
and
has
since
been
discussed
at
considerable
length
in
various
publications
it
is
that
the
slender
tails
together
with
the
enlargement
of
the
wing
just
back
of
them
give
the
impression
of
a
false
head
along
with
this
unusual
development
of
the
wing
is
to
be
considered
the
fact
that
these
butterflies
nearly
always
alight
head
downward
so
that
the
false
head
furnished
with
what
seem
to
be
waving
antennae
takes
the
place
that
would
naturally
be
occupied
by
the
true
head
instances
have
been
reported
in
which
this
false
head
has
apparently
been
nipped
off
by
a
lizard
and
much
evidence
has
accumulated
to
indicate
that
this
curious
device
may
be
a
real
protection
in
many
cases
of
course
the
loss
of
the
tails
and
the
part
of
the
wings
adjacent
would
be
comparatively
insignificant
in
most
cases
these
projections
on
the
wings
are
held
at
right
angles
to
the
plane
of
the
wing
while
nearly
half
a
hundred
species
of
have
been
found
in
north
america
only
a
few
of
these
are
sufficiently
abundant
to
require
discussion
in
this
little
book
great
purple
it
seems
something
of
a
reflection
on
the
activities
of
american
entomologists
to
say
that
after
the
lapse
of
more
than
a
century
since
abbott
studied
the
insects
of
georgia
our
knowledge
of
the
early
stages
of
two
of
the
largest
butterflies
is
still
confined
to
the
observations

made

this
is
true

these
little
butterflies
may
often
be
seen
visiting
the
midsummer
flowers
but
are
fully
as
likely
to
be
found
along
the
sides
of
a
shady
road
where
they
rest
upon
the
leaves
of
trees
shrubs
and
herbaceous
plants
when
disturbed
they
fly
up
in
small
companies
but
soon
settle
back
again
into
their
previous
positions
they
are
lovers
of

may
often
be

one
brood
a

butterflies
appearing
early
in
summer
and
remaining
for
several
weeks
they
lay
their
tiny
pale
green
eggs
upon
the
leaves
of
various
trees
especially
oaks
and
hickories
and
probably
hawthorns
it
is
not
known
whether
these
eggs
remain
unhatched
as
a
rule
until
the
following
spring
or
whether
they
soon
hatch
and
the
young
caterpillars
hibernate
without
feeding
it
is
probable
that
both
conditions
occur
in
spring
the
larvae
eat
holes
in
the
leaves
of
their
food
plant
and
grow
rather
slowly
gradually
becoming
brown
or
green
caterpillars
about
half
an
inch
long
they
finally
change
into
greenish
brown
chrysalids
from
which
the
butterflies
emerge
in
early
summer
striped
in
the
eastern
states
the
distribution
of
this
species
is
almost
the
same
as
that
of
the
banded
but
in
the
central
west
the
outline
of
its
region
moves
northward
extending
into
canada
above
north
dakota
and
into
montana
and
wyoming
it
does
not
go
so
far
south
however
extending
practically
only
to
the
southern
borders
of
kansas
and
missouri
the
butterfly
bears
a
striking
general
resemblance
to
the
other
species
just
named
differing
chiefly
in
the
fact
that
the
under
surface
of
the
wings
is
much
more
thickly
marked
with
broken
lines
that
extend
nearer
to
the
body
as
a
rule
it
is
not
common
and
consequently
it
is
prized
by
collectors
some
good
observers
have
noticed
that
it
is
more
likely
to
be
found
only
on
flowers
instead
of
sunning
itself
on
leaves
it
is
hibernating
either
in
the
egg
state
or
in
that
of
the
young
larvae
the
food
plants
are
varied
there
being
good
evidence
that
the

feeds
upon
all
of
these

found
a
chrysalis
of
this
species
in
the
deserted
nest
of
a
tent
caterpillar
in
new
hampshire
in
early
june
the
butterfly
emerging
later
in
the
month
acadian
this
is
one
of
the
numerous
butterflies
that
offers
some
young
student
an
opportunity
to
make
real
contributions
to
science
it
is
a
beautiful
little
creature
expanding
scarcely
an
inch
across
its
outstretched
wings
found
from
new
england
west
to
montana
along
a
rather
restricted
area
which
coincides
pretty
closely
with
the
southern
part
of
the
transition
zone
there
is
a
form
on
the
pacific
coast
which
is
commonly
considered
to
be
this
same
species
these
butterflies
appear
during
july
and
august
they
visit
various
flowers
but
are
especially
likely
to
be
found
near
willow
thickets
along
the
borders
of
brooks
and
swamps
it
is
supposed
that
the
eggs
are
laid
upon
the
willows
and
that
they
remain
unhatched
until
the
following
spring
then
they
develop
into
little
caterpillars
that
feed
upon
the
willow
leaves
and
mature
in
time
to
form
chrysalids
early
in
june
these
chrysalids
in
turn
disclose
the
butterfly
early
in
july
so
far
as
i
know
the
eggs
themselves
and
the
situation
in
which
they
are
laid
have
never
been
described
olive
very
few
butterflies
have
the
distinction
of
showing
a
clear
case
of
protective
resemblance
to
one
kind
of
plant
in
both
the
adult
and
the
larval
stages
this
is
the
case
however
with
this
olive
which
is
so
intimately
associated
with
our
common
red
cedar
that
where
one
is
found
the
other
is
likely
to
occur
although
both
caterpillars
and
butterflies
are
seldom
seen
because
they
resemble
the
twigs
of
the
cedar
so
closely
along
the
atlantic
coast
this
little
butterfly
occurs
from
new
hampshire
to
florida
and
westward
to
a
line
drawn
from
dakota
to
texas
the
upper
surface
of
the
wings
is
rather
dark
and
the
under
surface
so
far
as
it
is
exposed
when
the
butterfly
is
resting
is
of
a
greenish
hue
that
harmonizes
with
the
green
of
the
red
cedar
twigs
there
are
also
on
the
under
surface
some
irregular
lines
and
dots
of
red
brown
and
white
which
probably
help
in
rendering
the
insect
inconspicuous
when
it
is
resting
among
a
cluster
of
twigs
the
yearly
history
of
this
beautiful
little
butterfly
differs
from
that
of
most
of
its
relatives
the
species
winters
in
the
chrysalis
state
the
first
brood
of
butterflies
bursting
forth
early
in
may
these
lay
their
eggs
upon
or
between
the
scales
of
the
red
cedar
twigs
especially
those
which
bear
flowers
about
a
week
later
the
eggs
hatch
into
tiny
caterpillars
that
feed
upon
the
leaves
continuing
to
eat
and
grow
for
nearly
six
weeks
before
they
reach
their
full
size
these
caterpillars
are
so
similar
in
color
that
they
are
difficult
to
see
and
they
have
a
remarkable
protective
device
in
that
the
first
ring
behind
the
head
is
developed
into
a
shield
which
covers
the
head
hiding
it
so
completely
that
the
movement
of
the
jaws
in
feeding
is
effectively
concealed
late
in
june
they
change
to
chrysalids
part
of
which
appear
to
remain
in
this
condition
until
the
following
spring
while
most
of
them
give
forth
a
second
brood
of
butterflies
in
july
these
butterflies
lay
eggs
for
a
second
brood
of
larvae
that
mature
into
chrysalids
during
september
and
hibernate
in
this
condition
until
the
following
spring
consequently
in
the
northern
states
the
collector
should
look
for
fresh
specimens
in
may
and
early
june
and
again
in
july
and
early
august
these
butterflies
visit
various
flowers
apparently
preferring
rather
small
blossoms
such
as
those
of
the
everlasting
which
is
in
bloom
when
the
first
brood
is
flying
and
the
various
members
of
the
mint
family
especially
spearmint
as
well
as
the
sumacs
which
are
in
bloom
when
the
second
brood
is
on
the
wing
the
time
between
flower
visits
seems
to
be
spent
at
rest
upon
the
red
cedar
branches
and
one
of
the
surest
ways
to
find
the
butterflies
is
to
give
these
trees
a
sudden
jar
which
starts
them
into
flight

fact

may
often
be
seen

while
some

coppers
are
very
abundant
the
majority
are
rather
rare
only
a
few
species
are
sufficiently
widely
distributed
to
require
description
here
in
many
orders
of
insects
there
are
whole
families
whose
larvae
are
habitually
carnivorous
feeding
entirely
upon
other
kinds
of
insects
this
is
especially
so
in
case
of
the
beetles
the
flies
the
true
bugs
and
the
great
order
to
which
the
bees
and
wasps
belong
among
the
insects
however
carnivorous
caterpillars
are
rare
seldom
occurring
among
the
moths
and
in
hardly
more
than
one
species
among
the
butterflies
this
one
exception
is
the
little
butterfly
fancifully
called
the
wanderer
perhaps
because
instead
of
frequenting
the
flowery
fields
where
other
butterflies
congregate
it
wanders
in
and
out
among
the
alders
by
brooks
and
ponds
alighting
oftener
upon
a
leaf
or
twig
than
upon
a
flower
the
latter
apparently
lacking
for
it
the
attraction
it
has
for
other
butterflies
if
you
watch
one
of
these
creatures
for
awhile
however
you
will
soon
see
that
its
wandering
is
not
aimless
but
has
rather
a
method
all
its
own
perhaps
you
will
see
it
alight
upon
an
alder
twig
on
or
above
which
you
are
likely
to
notice
curious
woolly
white
excrescences
if
you
are
close
enough
you
will
probably
see
the
butterfly
uncoil
its
tongue
and
sip
up
a
liquid
on
twig
or
leaf
the
exudations
of
the
woolly
aphids
that
make
up
the
supposed
excrescence
and
suck
the
sap
from
the
bark
much
of
this
sap
passes
through
the
bodies
of
the
aphids
and
collects
in
liquid
globules
on
twigs
and
leaves
forming
a
sort
of
which
is
much
sought
after
by
flies
wasps
and
other
insects
it
seems
to
form
the
chief
sustenance
of
these
wanderers
but
many
of
these
butterflies
have
another
purpose
besides
that
of
sipping
the
should
you
watch
one
of
the
mother
butterflies
carefully
you
would
be
likely
to
see
her
alight
on
or
near
a
colony
of
woolly
aphids
and
run
rather
rapidly
over
them
in
a
manner
finally
stopping
long
enough
to
lay
a
tiny
roundish
slightly
flattened
egg
upon
the
twig
generally
on
the
under
side
and
only
one
in
a
place
then
she
may
continue
her
way
wandering
lazily
along
the
stream
let
us
now
centre
our
interest
upon
the
egg
three
or
four
days
later
it
hatches
into
a
curious
caterpillar
instead
of
having
mouth
parts
fitted
for
biting
leaves
as
is
the
case
with
most
butterfly
larvae
it
has
one
fitted
for
grasping
piercing
and
sucking
the
juices
of
the
plump
bodies
of
the
aphids
which
it
finds
hard
by
its
place
of
birth
it
also
has
silk
spinnerets
connected
with
its
mouth
so
it
is
able
to
spin
a
web
to
shelter
it
from
being
run
over
by
its
intended
victims
the
newly
hatched
larva
is
not
slow
to
take
advantage
of
the
facilities
with
which
it
is
provided
it
at
once
begins
to
spin
a
web
above
and
around
itself
from
the
end
of
which
it
reaches
out
for
the
nearest
aphids
sucking
their
and
casting
their
empty
skins
to
the
discard
of
its
protecting
web
the
skins
thus
serve
as
an
additional
shelter
so
that
as
the
caterpillar
moves
forward
increasing
the
number
of
its
victims
from
day
to
day
it
extends
its
web
and
the
protection
of
the
cast
skins
intermingled
with
it
while
through
all
the
cast
skins
the
silken
web
and
even
the
hairs
on
the
body
of
the
caterpillar
there
runs
a
woof
of
the
woolly
excretion
effectually
concealing
the
larva
from
sight
the
woolly
aphids
thus
serve
as
the
sole
food
of
the
caterpillar
during
its
brief
life
as
a
larva
perhaps
because
of
the
nature
of
its
food
it
is
able
to
mature
much
sooner
than
most
butterfly
larvae
in
about
eleven
days
after
hatching
it
is
ready
to
change
to
a
chrysalis
having
undergone
during
this
period
only
three
moults
instead
of
at
least
four
as
with
other
caterpillars
each
caterpillar
then
changes
to
a
chrysalis
which
is
remarkable
because
the
form
and
color
of
its
back
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
face
of
a
miniature
monkey
it
remains
in
this
condition
nearly
a
fortnight
and
then
emerges
as
a
butterfly
in
new
england
and
the
northern
states
the
short
life
of
the
larva
enables
this
insect
to
mature
three
broods
each
season
farther
south
there
are
probably
more
for
this
species
is
widely
distributed
in
eastern
north

occurring
from
nova
scotia
to
georgia
and
west
to
the
mississippi
valley
american
this
little
butterfly
is
one
of
the
most
generally
abundant
insects
in
the
northern
part
of
north
america
it
commonly
occurs
from
ocean
to
ocean
from
the
hudson
bay
region
to
the
latitude
of
georgia
and
it
flies
freely
in
city
parks
and
village
yards
as
well
as
in
the
more
open
spaces
of
field
and
forest
when
seen
through
a
lens
it
is
very
beautifully
colored
the
coppery
red
of
the
wings
being
overspread
with
conspicuous
black
dots
and
a
touch
of
orange
around
the
outer
border
the
expanded
wings
measure
just
about
an
inch
so
that
this
is
one
of
the
smallest
of
our
common
butterflies
the
caterpillars
of
the
american
copper
feed
upon
sorrel
one
of
the
commonest
weedy
plants
of
waste
places
everywhere
the
rusty
red
blossoms
of
the
sorrel
harmonize
in
color
with
the
color
of
the
butterfly
which
is
frequently
to
be
seen
flying
slowly
above
the
plants
stopping
now
and
then
to
lay
its
eggs
singly
upon
the
leaves
or
stems
each
egg
soon
hatches
into
a
curious
caterpillar
which
looks
more
like
a
slug
than
the
usual
type
of
butterfly
larva
it
feeds
upon
the
succulent
tissue
of
the
sorrel
leaf
at
first
biting
small
holes
in
the
under
surface
as
it
gets
larger
it
feeds
more
freely
and
is
likely
to
make
channels
instead
of
holes
it
matures
in
about
three
weeks
changing
into
a
chrysalis
under
the
shelter
of
a
stone
or
board
a
little
later
it
again
changes
to
a
butterfly
there
is
an
interesting
variation
in
the
number
of
broods
of
this
butterfly
each
season
in
regions
where
it
has
been
studied
it
has
been
found
to
be
in
northern
new
england
and
in
southern
new
england
and
the
atlantic
states
it
is
probable
that
in
its
far
northern
home
in
the
hudson
bay
territory
it
is
only
it
is
thought
that
the
insect
hibernates
as
a
chrysalis
these
little
butterflies
are
so
small
and
fly
so
near
the
ground
that
they
are
likely
to
be
overlooked
by
the
casual
observer
they
frequently
alight
to
sun
themselves
or
to
sip
nectar
from
many
kinds
of
flowers
they

exquisite
tints
of

are
distinguished
from

as
by

fact
that
the

a
wee
bit
of
a
creature
that
expands
scarcely
an
inch
across
its
outstretched
wings
the
spring
azure
has
caused
american
scientists
an
immense
amount
of
patient
labor
over
the
vast
territory
from
labrador
across
to
alaska
and
south
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
this
little
blue
butterfly
exists
in
so
many
different
forms
that
it
requires
special
analytical
keys
to
separate
them
not
only
does
it
vary
geographically
so
that
in
one
locality
we
find
one
form
and
in
another
a
different
form
but
it
also
varies
seasonally
to
a
marked
degree
as
one
would
expect
there
is
a
striking
difference
in
its
annual
cycle
between
labrador
and
the
gulf
coast
in
the
far
northern
region
there
is
but
one
brood
a
year
while
in
the
southern
region
there
are
at
least
two
and
perhaps
more
the
variations
in
this
butterfly
are
shown
by
the
differences
in
the
marking
of
both
surfaces
of
the
wings
these
markings
may
run
from
a
faint
blackish
border
along
the
extreme
margin
and
a
few
faint
dots
upon
the
under
surface
to
a
wide
black
margin
around
the
wings
and
a
deep
abundant
spotting
of
the
under
surface
the
markings
of
the
various
forms
are
so
uniform
that
the
varieties
are
easily
distinguished
it
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
book
to
attempt
to
differentiate
all
these
varieties
but
any
reader
interested
will
find
an
admirable
summary
of
the
conditions
illustrated
by
an
excellent
plate
in
comstock
how
to
know
the
butterflies
the
species
as
a
whole
may
be
known
from
the
fact
that
the
upper
surface
is
blue
the
lower
surface
more
or
less
spotted
with
dark
brown
and
the
wings
are
without
tails
plate
page
strange
structures
of
the
a
remarkable
variation
of
the
adults
is
sufficient
to
give
this
species
a
special
interest
but
the
larvae
also
have
a
unique
attraction
for
the
naturalist
the
mother
butterflies
lay
their
eggs
upon
the
flower
buds
of
various
plants
especially
those
which
have
clustered
racemes
of
blossoms
these
eggs
hatch
into
minute
larvae
which
feed
upon
the
buds
commonly
burrowing
through
the
calyx
lobes
and
devouring
the
undeveloped
stamens
and
pistils
inside
they
finally
change
to
chrysalids
which
are
more
or
less
securely
attached
to
a
central
flower
stalk
from
which
in
due
time
the
butterflies
emerge
so
far
there
is
nothing
remarkable
about
this
story
of
the
life
of
the
spring
azure
but
that
is
yet
to
come
these
little
caterpillars
are
subject
to
attack
by
tiny
parasitic
flies
which
lay
eggs
in
their
bodies
each
egg
hatches
into
a
still
more
tiny
maggot
that
lives
at
the
expense
of
the
tissues
of
the
caterpillar
and
finally
kills
it
when
one
of
these
little
caterpillars
has
its
head
buried
in
the
round
ball
of
a
flower
bud
about
half
of
its
body
is
exposed
defenseless
so
that
the
little
fly
that
lights
upon
it
to
lay
her
egg
can
not
even
be
dislodged
by
the
head
of
the
caterpillar
as
is
often
the
case
with
other
species
there
is
a
very
curious
provision
for
defense
however
if
you
look
carefully
through
a
lens
at
the
hind
part
of
the
body
you
will
find
a
little
opening
on
the
back
of
the
seventh
abdominal
ring
this
opening
leads
to
a
sort
of
tiny
pocket
a
pocket
which
the
caterpillar
can
turn
inside
out
when
it
so
desires
now
the
curious
thing
about
it
is
that
the
caterpillar
while
this
pocket
is
concealed
in
its
body
is
able
to
secrete
in
it
a
drop
of
liquid
which
we
presume
to
be
sweet
to
the
taste
when
the
little
pocket
is
partly
filled
with
this
drop
of
liquid
the
caterpillar
turns
it
inside
out
in
such
a
way
that
the
liquid
drop
remains
in
position
on
top
of
the
protruded
pocket
perhaps
you
ask
what
is
the
good
of
all
this
complicated
arrangement
if
you
could
see
what
happens
when
the
little
drop
of
what
for
lack
of
a
better
name
we
shall
call
is
exposed
you
would
begin
to
guess
the
reason
wherever
these
larvae
are
found
you
will
also
find
many
ants
wandering
round
among
them
and
the
moment
the
appears
these
ants
begin
to
sip
it
up
when
it
is
all
gone
the
little
caterpillar
draws
in
its
pocket
again
and
presumably
begins
to
store
up
another
bit
of
liquid
it
is
certainly
a
curious
example
of
what
the
naturalists
call
symbiosis
which
simply
means
a
living
together
of
two
animals
each
helping
the
other
in
some
way
in
this
case
it
is
easy
enough
to
see
how
the
caterpillar
helps
the
ant
but
perhaps
you
are
wondering
in
what
possible
way
the
ant
may
help
the
caterpillar
i
hardly
dare
give
the
most
plausible
explanation
for
fear
some
one
will
cry
out
but
fortunately
the
explanation
is
based
upon
at
least
one
precise
observation
by
edwards
one
of
the
most
careful
and
reliable
naturalists
america
has
produced
who
lived
before
the
recent
era
of
and
was
never
accused
of
sensationalism
edwards
saw
an
ant
drive
away
from
one
of
these
caterpillars
a
little
parasitic
fly
which
apparently
was
searching
for
a
victim
consequently
it
would
appear
that
the
ants
helped
the
caterpillars
by
protecting
them
from
these
arch
enemies
this
is
by
no
means
an
isolated
example
of
the
relations
between
ants
and
other
insects
it
has
been
known
for
hundreds
of
years
that
the
ants
use
the
aphids
as
a
sort
of
domestic
attending
the
aphids
at
all
times
and
even
caring
for
their
eggs
throughout
the
winter
season
as
the
live
in
colonies
sucking
the
sap
of
their
host
plant
they
are
attended
by
great
numbers
of
ants
that
feed
upon
the
which
passes
through
their
bodies
in
many
cases
the
ants
have
been
observed
to
stroke
the
aphids
with
their
antennae
in
a
way
which
seems
to
induce
the
aphid
to
give
out
a
drop
of
the
sweet
liquid
for
the
ant
to
lap
up
in
a
similar
way
these
ants
seem
sometimes
to
stroke
these
little
caterpillars
with
their
antennae
and
thus
to
induce
them
to
turn
their
little
pockets
inside
out
with
the
drop
of
liquid
at
the
tip
this
is
certainly
an
unusual
and
most
interesting
relation
between
two
insects
far
separated
by
their
structural
characters
the
little
pocket
that
i
have
thus
described
is
situated
upon
the
seventh
segment
of
the
abdomen
just
back
of
it
there
are
two
other
openings
which
are
even
more
curious
in
their
structure
these
are
provided
with
some
slender
tentacles
on
which
there
are
circles
of
hairy
spurs
these
structures
are
a
great
puzzle
to
naturalists
it
is
difficult
to
explain
what
they
are
for
unless
we
assume
that
they
relate
in
some
way
to
the
pocket
on
the
seventh
ring
the
only
plausible
explanation
is
that
these
serve
to
advertise
to
the
ants
by
giving
off
a
distinctive
odor
that
there
is
nectar
near
at
hand
to
be
had
for
the
asking
they
would
thus
be
analogous
in
a
way
to
the
fragrant
scent
of
flowers
which
is
for
the
purpose
of
advertising
to
the
bee
the
fact
that
nectar
or
pollen
or
both
are
near
at
hand
and
may
be
had
for
the
asking
in
the
case
of
these
caterpillars
however
if
this
is
the
true
explanation
it
is
a
most
wonderful
provision
and
one
which
would
be
likely
to
tax
the
ingenuity
of
man
mind
for
a
long
while
before
it
was
originated
so
this
little
butterfly
which
greets
us
in
every
spring
like
a
violet
afloat
to
quote
scudder
happy
phrase
is
full
of
interest
at
all
stages
of
its
existence
it
should
lead
one
to
a
new
respect
for
the
familiar
things
in
the
natural
world
when
one
learns
how
baffling
to
the
wits
of
the
wisest
scientist
is
this
little
creature
with
its
protean
forms
and
the
wonderful
structure
of
its
caterpillars
this
beautiful
little
butterfly
is
perhaps
the
most
richly
colored
of
all
our
northern
blues
the
upper
surface
of
the
wings
in
the
male
is
a
nearly
uniform
hue
except
for
a
narrow
dark
border
around
the
margin
in
the
female
there
is
in
addition
a
series
of
orange
spots
inside
of
the
black
border
the
series
being
more
prominent
on
the
hind
wings
than
on
the
front
ones
the
under
surface
is
very
pale
with
distinct
marks
in
black
scattered
over
the
basal
two
thirds
with
a
row
of
orange
spots
outside
of
these
and
another
row
of
small
blackish
spots
just
inside
of
the
blackish
border
stripe
this
butterfly
is
a
northern
species
it
occurs
in
new
england
new
york
and
michigan
and
thence
extends
far
north
into
canada
the
caterpillar
feeds
upon
blue
lupine
and
apparently
the
butterfly
is
likely
to
be
found
in
most
places
where
this
plant
grows
the
eggs
are
laid
upon
the
leaves
or
stems
and
the
little
caterpillars
come
out
of
the
shells
through
small
holes
which
they
have
gnawed
the
caterpillar
wrote
scudder
has
a
very
extensible
head
and
flexible
neck
and
its
manner
of
feeding
immediately
after
birth
is
rather
remarkable
it
pierces
the
lower
cuticle
of
the
leaf
making
a
hole
just
large
enough
to
introduce
its
minute
head
and
then
devours
all
the
interior
of
the
leaf
as
far
as
it
can
reach
many
times
the
diameter
of
the
hole
so
that
when
the
caterpillar
goes
elsewhere
the
leaf
looks
as
if
marked
with
a
circular
blister
having
a
central
nucleus
the
nearly
colorless
membranes
of
the
leaf
being
all
that
is
left
and
at
the
central
entrance
to
the
blister
the
upper
membrane
only
later
in
its
life
it
often
modifies
this
feeding
habit
somewhat
and
as
it
approaches
full
growth
it
is
likely
to
devour
the
entire
blade
of
the
leaf
these
larvae
have
the
curious
glands
on
the
seventh
abdominal
segment
which
are
discussed
in
connection
with
the
preceding
species
many
ants
are
attracted
by
this
secretion
so
that
it
often
happens
that
the
easiest
way
to
find
the
caterpillars
is
to
look
for
these
attendants
in
new
england
there
are
two
broods
of
the
butterfly

appearing
early
in

and
the
other
late
in

tiny

of

superfamily
the
true

are
so
distinct
in
their
structure
and
many
of
their
habits
from
the
skippers
that
the
most
careful
students
of
the
order
are
pretty
well
agreed
in
making
the
two
great
superfamilies
papilionoidea
the
true
butterflies
and

the
latter
includes
these
two
families

eggs
soon
hatch
into
little
caterpillars
which
at
first
roll
parts
of
the
leaves
into
cylinders
fastening
the
sides
in
place
by
silken
threads
and
later
burrow
into
the
stem
and

making
a
tunnel
a

more

the

remain
until
full
grown

are
then
nearly
four
inches
long

emerge

the
common
skippers
family
the
skippers
are
the
least
developed
of
the
butterflies
they
show
their
close
relationship
to
the
moths
both
by
their
structure
and
their
habits
the
larvae
make
slight
cocoons
before
changing
to
chrysalids
and
these
chrysalids
are
so
rounded
that
they
suggest
the
pupae
of
moths
rather
than
those
of
butterflies
the
common
name
skippers
is
due
to
the
habit
of
the
butterflies
a
jerky
skipping
flight
as
they
wing
their
erratic
way
from
flower
to
flower
in
north
america
the
skipper
family
includes
nearly
two
hundred
species
grouped
in
about
forty
genera
from
this
point
of
view
it
is
the
largest
family
of
our
butterflies
but
on
account
of
the
small
size
and
limited
range
of
most
of
the
species
it
has
by
no
means
the
general
importance
of
such
families
as
the
nymphs
the
swallowtails
or
the
pierids
the
skippers
are
remarkable
for
the
uniformity
of
structure
in
each
stage
of
existence
the
butterflies
have
small
wings
and
large
bodies
the
broad
head
bears
large
eyes
without
hairs
but
with
a
tuft
of
curving
bristles
overhanging
each
the
antennae
are
hooked
at
the
end
and
widely
separated
at
the
base
each
short
palpus
has
a
large
middle
joint
and
a
small
joint
at
the
tip
the
fore
wings
project
out
at
the
front
angle
and
the
hind
wings
are
folded
along
the
inner
margin
there
are
six
legs
in
both
sexes
the
colors
are
chiefly
various
tones
of
brown
dull
rather
than
bright
and
many
of
the
forms
resemble
one
another
so
closely
that
it
is
difficult
to
separate
them
the
skipper
caterpillars
have
stout
bodies
and
are
easily
known
by
the
constricted
neck
most
of
these
have
the
habit
of
making
nests
from
the
leaves
of
the
food
plants
weaving
them
together
with
silken
threads
in
a
similar
way
each
also
makes
a
slight
cocoon
when
it
is
ready
to

chrysalis
the
skippers
found
in
eastern
north
america
are
commonly
grouped
into
two
types
the
larger
skippers
and
the
smaller
skippers
the
characteristics
are
given
in
the
paragraph
immediately
following
and
the
one
on
page
the
tribe
of
the
larger
skippers
the
butterflies
of
this
tribe
have
that
part
of
the
club
of
the
antenna
which
is
recurved
about
as
long
as
the
thicker
part
below
it
as
a
rule
the
abdomen
is
distinctly
shorter
than
the
hind
wings
the
caterpillars
are
rather
short
and
thick
and
the
upper
part
of
the
head
when
looked
at
from
in
front
is
square
or
roundish
rather
than
tapering
the
chrysalids
have
the
tongue
case
attached
throughout
its
length
and
stopping
short
of
the
tips
of
the
wing
cases
one
can
seldom
draw
hard
and
fast
artificial
lines
in
nature
there
are
all
sorts
of
intermediate
conditions
which
disturb
arbitrary
classifications
it
might
seem
simple
enough
to
say
that
some
insects
are
and
others
are
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
case
of
the
skipper
we
have
an
insect
which
starts
its
larval
life
as
a
and
finishes
it
as
a
its
is
rather
interesting
and
easily
observed
if
one
can
find
the
larvae
at
work
upon
the
leaves
of
locusts
and
other
trees
plates
pages
the
skipper
is
one
of
the
largest
butterflies
of
the
interesting
group
to
which
it
belongs
it
lays
its
eggs
upon
the
upper
surface
of
the
leaflets
of
locusts
and
other
plants
of
the
legume
family
in
less
than
a
week
each
egg
hatches
into
a
little
caterpillar
with
a
very
large
head
and
a
comparatively
large
body
tapering
rapidly
toward
the
hind
end
this
little
creature
cuts
out
from
one
side
of
the
leaf
a
small
round
flap
which
it
turns
over
and
binds
in
place
by
silken
threads
to
make
a
home
for
itself
this
little
home
shows
considerable
variation
in
its
construction
but
it
usually
has
an
arched
dome
held
in
place
by
strands
of
silk
running
from
the
eaten
fragment
to
the
surface
of
the
leaf
it
remains
an
occupant
of
this
home
until
after
the
second
moult
about
this
time
it
becomes
too
large
for
its
house
and
deserts
it
to
make
a
new
one
generally
by
fastening
together
two
adjacent
leaves
these
are
attached
along
the
edges
by
silken
strands
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
considerable
room
it
leaves
one
end
open
as
a
door
out
of
which
the
caterpillar
crawls
to
feed
at
night
upon
leaves
returning
to
the
house
for
shelter
during
the
day
they
continue
to
use
this
habitation
until
they
are
full
grown
as
caterpillars
and
sometimes
they
change
to
chrysalids
within
it
more
commonly
however
they
crawl
away
both
from
the
leafy
case
and
the
tree
that
bears
it
and
find
such
shelter
as
they
can
upon
the
ground
near
by
here
they
spin
slight
silken
cocoons
within
which
they
change
to
chrysalids
in
the
more
northern
states
there
is
but
one
brood
a
year
so
these
chrysalids
remain
in
position
until
early
the
following
summer
when
they
come
forth
as
butterflies
farther
south
there
are
two
broods
each
summer
the
second
brood
of
butterflies
appearing
chiefly
in
august
the
skipper
derives
its
name
from
the
distinct
silvery
spots
upon
the
surface
against
a
background
of
dark
brown
the
butterflies
appear
in
the
northern
states
early
in
june
and
remain
upon
the
wing
for
several
weeks
being
found
even
in
august
they
fly
very
rapidly
and
are
difficult
to
catch
in
an
insect
net
except
when
they
are
visiting
flowers
this
species
is
widely
distributed
occurring
from
ocean
to
ocean
over
nearly
the
whole
of
the
united
states
it
extends
into
canada
only
in
the
eastern
part
and
is
not
found
in
the
northwestern
states
this
is
perhaps
the
most
easily
recognized
of
all
the
skippers
found
in
the
united
states
for
it
is
the
only
one
that
looks
like
a
swallowtail
its
hind
wings
project
backward
as
long
broad
tails
in
a
way
that
marks
the
insect
at
once
as
different
from
anything
else
it
expands
nearly
two
inches
and
when
the
front
wings
are
spread
at
right
angles
the
distance
from
the
apex
of
the
front
wing
to
the
end
of
the
tail
of
the
hind
wing
just
about
equals
the
expanse
the
general
color
is
dark
brown
with
about
eight
more
or
less
rectangular
silvery
spots
on
each
front
wing
this
is
distinctly
a
tropical
species
which
is
common
along
the
gulf
coast
from
mexico
to
florida
it
ranges
north
along
the
atlantic
coast
to
new
york
city
and
even
to
connecticut
in
the
south
atlantic
states
it
is
common
but
toward
the
northern
limits
of
its
range
it
is
very
rare
in
the
west
indies
this
butterfly
is
very
common
and
has
been
observed
to
rest
with
its
wings
vertical
the
front
ones
held
far
back
between
the
hind
ones
and
the
tails
of
the
latter
held
at
right
angles
to
the
plane
of
the
wings
apparently
this
curious
fact
was
first
noted
by
longstaff
of
course
in
museum
specimens
the
wings
have
been
flattened
into
the
same
plane
during
the
process
of
drying
so
that
this
peculiarity
would
not
be
noticed

are
few
trees
which
have
so
interesting
a
set
of
insects
attacking
them
as
does
the
oak
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
to
find
abundant
material
for
a
large
volume
by
making
a
study
of
the
of
the
various
insects
that
live
upon
or
within
the
various
tissues
of
this
tree
the
leaves
alone
provide
a
home
for
a
remarkably
large
number
of
insect
species
scattered
through
a
great
many
orders
and
families
the
thickened
blades
seem
to
furnish
an
ideal
opportunity
for
many
larvae
to
get
their
living
and
they
are
particularly
useful
to
those
which
need
to
make
a
winter
nest
by
a
little
searching
almost
any
time
after
the
middle
of
june
one
is
likely
to
find
a
curious
caterpillar
home
upon
some
of
the
oak
leaves
the
margin
of
the
blade
has
been
turned
over
generally
from
above
downward
but
sometimes
from
below
upward
and
has
been
fastened
down
to
the
main
expanse
of
the
blade
by
means
of
golden
threads
commonly
this
fastening
is
not
continuous
but
is
more
or
less
intermittent
so
that
the
margin
is
likely
to
have
an
irregular
border
where
it
joins
the
blade
inside
of
this
tubular
construction
a
rather
unusual
looking
caterpillar
is
probably
to
be
seen
late
in
the
season
it
will
probably
be
nearly
an
inch
long
with
a
smooth
greenish
body
and
a
head
that
may
be
a
bit
brownish
and
more
or
less
marked
on
the
sides
with
orange
tones
this
is
the
larva
of
one
of
the
most
widely
distributed
skippers
juvenal
the
species
is
found
from
southern
new
hampshire
west
to
the
great
plains
and
south
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
in
most
localities
it
is
seldom
abundant
but
yet
is
so
general
that
it
may
be
found
by
almost
every
persistent
collector
the
wings
expand
about
an
inch
and
a
half
and
are
of
a
dull
brownish
color
more
or
less
marked
with
darker
and
lighter
spots
toward
the
northern
limits
of
its
range
there
is
but
one
brood
a
year
but
farther
south
there
are
two
although
it
is
not
improbable
that
some
of
the
caterpillars
of
the
first
brood
remain
unchanged
throughout
the
season
so
that
the
insect
is
both
and
in
the
same
locality
yearly
the
yearly
cycle
in
southern
new
hampshire
may
be
taken
as
an
illustration
of
the
life
of
the
species
in
regions
where
there
is
but
one
brood
the
butterflies
appear
in
open
woods
and
on
lands
in
may
and
june
they
lay
eggs
upon
the
twigs
of
oak
trees
one
egg
in
a
place
and
generally
near
a
leaf
stem
the
egg
soon
hatches
into
a
little
caterpillar
that
crawls
upon
a
leaf
and
begins
the
construction
of
its
tubular
nest
by
bending
over
the
margin
and
sewing
it
with
golden
silk
it
utilizes
this
nest
chiefly
as
a
tent
for
resting
and
sleeping
and
wanders
away
from
it
generally
to
another
leaf
when
it
is
ready
to
feed
it
grows
very
slowly
having
before
it
all
the
weeks
of
summer
to
complete
its
caterpillar
growth
as
it
gets
larger
it
needs
a
new
tent
and
is
likely
to
desert
its
early
one
when
it
does
this
some
observers
have
noted
a
curious
habit
it
cuts
loose
all
the
silk
that
binds
the
margin
of
the
leaf
down
upon
the
blade
so
that
the
flap
is
free
to
spring
back
to
its
original
position
it
would
be
difficult
to
suggest
an
adequate
explanation
for
this
habit
when
autumn
comes
our
caterpillar
is
faced
with
the
problem
of
passing
through
the
winter
successfully
it
must
shelter
itself
from
birds
spiders
predaceous
beetles
and
many
other
enemies
it
must
find
a
means
of
keeping
out
of
the
reach
of
snow
and
rain
for
while
it
can
survive
a
great
degree
of
cold
as
long
as
it
keeps
dry
it
might
easily
be
killed
by
freezing
up
with
moisture
but
the
caterpillar
is
able
to
provide
against
these
dangers
it
has
apparently
an
abundant
supply
of
liquid
silk
to
secrete
from
the
silk
glands
in
its
head
so
it
lines
its
tubular
tent
with
a
dense
silken
web
that
effectually
excludes
enemies
and
moisture
it
thus
has
on
the
outside
of
its
nest
the
thick
oak
leaf
and
on
the
inside
a
dense
soft
lining
that
makes
a
most
admirable
winter
protection
so
it
remains
here
throughout
the
winter
the
leaf
commonly
staying
on
the
tree
until
early
spring
then
leaf
nest
and
enclosed
caterpillar
are
likely
to
drop
to
the
ground
to
remain
until
spring
arrives
in
earnest
just
what
happens
then
seems
to
be
a
bit
doubtful
the
caterpillar
changes
to
a
chrysalis
but
whether
it
first
works
its
way
out
of
its
winter
nest
and
makes
a
new
and
less
dense
covering
seems
not
to
be
certainly
known
here
is
another
good
opportunity
for
some
careful
observations
at
any
rate
the
caterpillar
changes
to
a
chrysalis
and
late
in
spring
it
changes
again
to
an
adult
butterfly
that
flits
about
on
dusky
wing
for
a
few
weeks
before
it
dies
sleepy
the
appearance
of
this
butterfly
both
as
to
size
and
marking
is
very
similar
to
that
of
juvenal
except
that
the
white
spots
are
not
present
on
the
front
wing
of
this
species
the
of
the
two
species
as
well
as
their
distribution
seem
to
be
closely
parallel
the
present
butterflies
are
to
be
found
early
in
summer
in
the
same
oak
barrens
as
the
other
the
blueberry
blossoms
being
freely
visited
for
nectar
by
both
species
this
is
a
rather
small
dark
brown
skipper
with
a
few
white
spots
toward
the
apex
of
the
front
wing
but
otherwise
not
marked
except
for
a
very
pale
transverse
band
which
is
almost
obsolete
the
butterfly
is
found
from
ocean
to
ocean
along
the
northern
tier
of
states
it
also
occurs
in
the
eastern
states
as
far
south
as
florida
as
well
as
in
the
states
along
the
pacific
coast
the
food
plants
of
the
caterpillars
differ
from
most
of
those
of
the
other
skippers
the
butterflies
lay
their
yellowish
green
eggs
one
in
a
place
upon
the
leaves
of
willows
and
poplars
these
soon
hatch
into
little
caterpillars
each
of
which
cuts
out
a
small
flap
along
the
margin
of
the
leaf
and
folds
it
over
fastening
it
in
place
with
silken
threads
it
thus
forms
a
protecting
nest
within
which
it
remains
during
the
day
going
forth
at
night
to
a
neighboring
part
of
the
same
leaf
or
to
another
leaf
and
feeding
upon
the
green
surface
tissues
in
this
first
caterpillar
stage
it
does
not
eat
the
veins
to
any
extent
as
it
becomes
larger
it
constructs
a
larger
nest
and
feeds
more
freely
upon
the
leaf
tissues
when
about
half
grown
it
has
the
curious
habit
of
biting
out
small
holes
here
and
there
in
the
blade
so
that
the
leaf
takes
on
a
very
unusual
appearance
the
presence
of
these
holes
is
generally
the
easiest
way
to
find
the
caterpillars
for
when
the
holes
are
seen
a
little
searching
is
likely
to
show
one
the
characteristic
nest
after
a
few
weeks
the
caterpillars
become
full
grown
they
then
sew
themselves
in
for
the
winter
fastening
all
of
the
crevices
in
the
nest
so
securely
with
silken
webbing
that
a
very
serviceable
winter
cocoon
is
formed
an
interesting
fact
is
that
this
sewing
up
for
the
winter
is
likely
to
take
place
about
midsummer
the
caterpillars
remaining
quiet
from
this
time
until
the
following
spring
the
nests
of
course
fall
in
autumn
with
the
leaves
and
the
caterpillars
remain
unchanged
until
april
or
may
when
they
transform
into
chrysalids
to
emerge
in
may
as
butterflies
there
appears
to
be
normally
but
one

a
year
although
there
is
some
evidence
of
a
partial
second
brood
sooty
this
is
one
of
the
smallest
of
the
blackish
skippers
and
may
be
known
by
its
small
size
expanding
less
than
an
inch
and
the
series
of
five
white
dots
near
the
apex
of
the
front
wing
these
dots
being
more
distinct
on
the
under
surface
the
species
is
widely
distributed
occurring
over
practically
the
whole
of
the
united
states
except
in
the
states
along
the
canadian
border
from
wisconsin
west
and
in
several
of
these
it
is
found
along
their
southern
limits
this
butterfly
is
of
particular
interest
because
it
is
one
of
the
comparatively
few
species
that
habitually
occur
in
gardens
and
cultivated
fields
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
eggs
are
laid
upon
white
pigweed
or
lambs
quarter
the
common
garden
pest
of
the
genus
chenopodium
the
eggs
are
laid
singly
generally
on
the
upper
surface
and
hatch
in
about
five
days
into
tiny
caterpillars
that
make
a
little
shelter
for
themselves
by
cutting
out
the
edge
of
a
leaf
and
folding
over
the
blade
sewing
it
in
place
by
a
few
silken
threads
here
they
remain
and
feed
upon
the
green
pulp
of
the
succulent
leaves
either
within
the
nest
or
near
by
outside
they
remain
in
these
cases
until
the
time
for
the
first
moult
when
they
are
likely
to
line
the
inside
of
the
silken
web
before
moulting
after
this
they
make
new
cases
for
concealment
and
shelter
the
cases
as
they
grow
older
being
generally
made
of
two
or
more
leaves
securely
bound
together
by
silken
web
along
their
margin
when
they
become
full
grown
they
spin
a
silken
cocoon
and
change
to
yellowish
green
chrysalids
from
which
the
butterflies
emerge
a
little
more
than
a
week
later
this
species
is
supposed
to
be
in
the
north
the
caterpillars
of
the
second
brood
sew
up
their
leafy
cases
very
carefully
making
them
of
such
thick
silken
webbing
that
they
are
watertight
they
remain
in
these
coverings
until
the
following
spring
when
each
changes
still
within
the
case
into
a
chrysalis
from
which
the
butterfly
comes
forth
in
april
or
may
the
tribe
of
the
smaller
skippers
in
the
members
of
this
tribe
the
tip
beyond
the
club
of
the
antenna
is
short
and
the
abdomen
is
long
enough
to
extend
as
far
as
or
farther
than
the
hind
wings
the
caterpillars
have
long
and
slender
bodies
with
the
upper
part
of
the
head
when
looked
at
from
in
front
tapering
rather
than
roundish
or
square
the
chrysalids
have
the
free
at
the
tip
and
projecting
beyond
the
tips
of
the
this
is
one
of
the
commonest
and
most
widely
distributed
of
all
our
skippers
it
is
found
from
nova
scotia
to
british
columbia
south
along
the
rocky
mountains
to
new
mexico
texas
and
florida
it
is
apparently
absent
west
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
along
the
gulf
coast
except
in
florida
its
was
carefully
worked
out
by
james
fletcher
late
entomologist
to
the
dominion
of
canada
and
in
the
north
may
be
summarized
thus
the
butterflies
come
from
the
hibernated
chrysalids
in
may
or
june
they
remain
upon
the
wing
for
several
weeks
so
that
worn
specimens
may
be
taken
late
in
july
or
rarely
even
early
in
august
the
females
lay
eggs
upon
grass
blades
these
eggs
hatch
about
two
weeks
later
the
larvae
eating
their
way
out
of
the
shells
so
slowly
that
a
whole
day
may
be
taken
up
by
the
operation
each
little
caterpillar
weaves
a
silken
nest
for
itself
in
which
it
remains
concealed
most
of
the
time
reaching
out
to
feed
upon
adjacent
blades
of
grass
but
retiring
into
the
nest
at
the
least
alarm
it
is
a
sluggish
little
creature
and
grows
so
slowly
that
in
the
north
it
may
require
more
than
two
months
to
become
full
fed
as
a
larva
it
is
then
about
an
inch
long
and
has
the
characteristic
outlines
of
the
other
skipper
larvae
with
a
black
head
and
a
greenish
brown
body
it
now
spins
a
cocoon
possibly
using
its
larval
nest
as
a
basis
and
some
time
later
before
cold
weather
surely
it
changes
to
a
chrysalis
that
winters
over
this
is
the
story
of
the
life
of
the
butterfly
in
the
more
northern
parts
of
its
range
even
in
new
hampshire
there
seems
to
be
at
least
a
partial
second
brood
and
farther
south
there
are
probably
two
regular
broods
with
the
possibility
that
a
small
percentage
of
the
first
set
of
chrysalids
remains
unchanged
until
spring
roadside
this
little
butterfly
is
found
apparently
in
most
parts
of
the
united
states
as
it
has
been
collected
in
new
england
california
texas
and
many
intermediate
points
over
the
northern
part
of
its
range
there
is
but
one
brood
a
year
in
new
hampshire
the
butterflies
appear
in
may
and
early
june
and
lay
eggs
upon
the
blades
of
various
grasses
these
hatch
about
ten
days
later
into
slender
caterpillars
each
of
which
makes
a
nest
for
itself
by
sewing
together
the
margin
of
one
or
more
grass
blades
when
the
larvae
get
larger
they
make
larger
and
denser
nests
with
heavy
linings
of
silken
web
after
the
earlier
moults
the
thin
skin
is
covered
with
very
fine
hairs
between
which
there
is
developed
a
curious
whitish
exudation
so
that
the
caterpillars
have
a
flocculent
appearance
when
full
grown
they
change
to
delicate
green
chrysalids
which
apparently
in
the
north
remain
until
the
following
spring
before
disclosing
the
butterflies
in
more
southern
regions
there
are
two
broods
each
summer
least
the
least
skipper
differs
from
the
other
skippers
both
in
structure
and
habits
most
of
these
butterflies
have
thick
bodies
and
a
distinct
hook
at
the
end
of
each
antenna
this
has
a
slender
body
and
the
antennae
lack
the
hook
most
skippers
have
strong
wings
and
show
their
strength
in
their
rapid
erratic
flight
this
has
feeble
wings
that
show
their
weakness
in
their
slow
straight
flight
but
from
the
fact
that
it
is
about
the
smallest
of
all
our
butterflies
expanding
little
more
than
three
quarters
of
an
inch
it
deserves
our
interested
attention
the
tawny
wings
are
so
marked
with
broad
margins
of
dark
brown
that
they
show
the
tawny
tinge
chiefly
in
the
middle
spaces
on
account
of
its
small
size
and
its
retiring
habits
this
little
butterfly
is
often
overlooked
by
all
but
the
most
experienced
collectors
it
generally
flies
slowly
just
above
the
grass
in
sunny
places
in
wet
meadows
and
along
the
open
margins
of
brooks
and
marshes
it
rests
frequently
upon
grasses
flowers
or
bushes
scudder
noticed
that
when
resting
these
butterflies
have
the
curious
habit
of
moving
their
antennae
in
a
small
circle
the
motion
of
the
two
alternating
that
is
when
one
is
moving
in
a
forward
direction
the
other
is
passing
in
a
reverse
direction
this
is
the
sort
of
observation
that
should
challenge
us
all
to
sharper
wits
in
watching
living
butterflies
it
would
be
strange
if
no
others
thus
twirled
their
feelers
in
their
leisure
moments
who
will
find
out
the
female
butterflies
at
least
have
something
to
do
besides
sipping
the
nectar
of
flowers
or
idly
twirling
their
feelers
they
must
lay
their
eggs
and
thus
provide
for
the
continuation
of
the
species
to
do
this
they
find
suitable
blades
of
grass
on
which
they
deposit
their
tiny
smooth
yellow
eggs
a
week
or
so
later
each
egg
hatches
into
a
dumpy
little
yellow
caterpillar
with
a
black
head
and
a
body
well
covered
with
hairy
bristles
this
little
creature
is
a
silk
spinner
and
makes
a
home
instinctively
by
drawing
together
more
or
less
the
outer
edges
of
a
leaf
blade
and
fastening
them
with
transverse
bands
of
silk
it
then
feeds
upon
the
green
tissues
and
as
it
grows
larger
it
makes
its
nest
more
secure
by
thicker
walls
of
silken
web
when
full
grown
as
a
caterpillar
it
changes
into
a
slender
chrysalis
generally
of
a
grayish
red
color
thickly
dotted
with
black
about
ten
days
later
it
emerges
as
a
butterfly
the
least
skipper
is
one
of
the
most

distributed
of
all
butterflies
it
