the
phenomenal
success
of
cyrano
de
bergerac
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
most
important
literary
events
of
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
it
at
once
placed
edmond
rostand
a
young
man
of
at
the
head
of
the
small
band
of
french
dramatic
writers
all
men
of
marked
ability
maurice
donnay
georges
de
françois
de
curel
paul
hervieu
henri
lavedan
who
had
been
struggling
for
supremacy
since
the
disappearance
of
the
two
great
masters
of
modern
french
comedy
émile
augier
and
alexandre
dumas
fils
there
was
no
hesitation
on
the
part
of
the
public
it
was
at
once
recognised
that
what
had
just
been
produced
upon
the
stage
was
not
simply
better
than
what
had
been
seen
for
a
long
time
but
was
also
to
a
certain
extent
of
a
different
nature
and
the
verdict
rendered
by
the
french
public
in
december
has
since
then
been
approved
by
readers
and
in
nearly
every
one
of
the
countries
belonging
to
western
civilisation
can
it
be
said
however
that
to
an
american
or
an
englishman
cyrano
is
all
that
it
is
to
a
frenchman
that
its
production
would
have
been
possible
outside
of
as
well
as
in
france
and
its
success
as
significant
in
london
as
in
paris
if
cyrano
is
really
a
great
work
these
questions
must
be
answered
negatively
for
it
is
in
the
nature
of
great
literary
works
that
they
consist
of
a
combination
of
what
is
purely
human
with
what
belongs
to
the
time
and
place
where
they
have
had
their
birth
they
must
have
enough
of
what
is
purely
human
to
make
it
possible
for
them
to
be
universally
accepted
understood
and
admired
but
they
must
be
also
strongly
national
so
that
their
universal
acceptance
may
help
in
spreading
all
over
the
world
part
of
the
national
ideal
which
prevails
in
their
birthplace
and
to
these
elements
may
be
joined
a
third
one
which
is
sure
to
add
greatly
to
their
success
and
which
cyrano
possesses
in
a
very
high
degree
viz
timeliness
as
soon
as
cyrano
appeared
it
seemed
to
the
french
that
this
was
just
what
they
had
been
waiting
for
two
things
especially
appealed
to
them
one
of
a
purely
literary
nature
the
other
one
a
part
of
the
basis
of
moral
feelings
and
ideas
upon
which
the
play
is
built
first
of
all
it
was
a
clear
play
full
of
light
and
sunshine
edmond
rostand
hails
from
the
south
of
france
and
the
atmosphere
of
his
play
is
as
translucid
as
the
atmosphere
of
his
native
provence
it
is
as
far
removed
from
symbolism
and
mysticism
as
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
are
from
the
fogs
of
scandinavia
every
incident
in
the
play
rests
upon
some
trait
of
character
or
combination
of
circumstances
which
has
been
explained
at
some
previous
moment
every
one
of
the
leading
characters
and
cyrano
most
of
all
stands
out
in
bold
relief
and
there
is
no
mistaking
what
they
stand
for
but
this
clearness
is
mainly
for
the
countrymen
of
the
author
it
depends
partly
upon
the
previous
possession
by
the
audience
of
a
number
of
notions
which
are
part
of
the
intellectual
inheritance
of
the
race
the
play
although
quite
modern
in
its
style
and
construction
is
in
some
respects
for
the
french
a
resurrection
of
a
portion
of
their
glorious
past
for
them
the
de
bourgogne
les
cardinal
de
richelieu
are
more
than
mere
names
the
earlier
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
was
for
france
a
period
of
wonderful
national
energy
it
is
then
and
not
later
that
france
acquired
that
supremacy
over
the
european
continent
which
is
usually
associated
with
the
name
of
louis
xiv
but
which
was
already
established
when
that
monarch
assumed
the
reins
of
government
the
timeliness
of
rostand
great
play
was
shown
exactly
in
this
that
it
called
the
attention
of
the
french
back
to
a
time
when
the
nation
was
full
of
youthful
and
vigourous
ambition
when
a
frenchman
would
hardly
believe
that
there
was
anything
that
he
could
not
do
if
he
set
his
mind
to
it
when
it
became
the
fashion
to
say
that
impossible
was
not
a
french
word
ever
since
the
war
of
the
pall
of
defeat
had
hung
over
the
french
the
stage
showed
this
in
a
striking
manner
the
plays
that
were
produced
presented
on
the
whole
a
stern
or
a
pessimistic
conception
of
life
the
great
periods
of
history
especially
in
which
french
valour
carried
everything
before
it
remained
neglected
for
fear
of
the
painful
contrast
which
they
would
present
with
the
humiliated
condition
of
a
vanquished
country
the
men
who
wrote
these
plays
belonged
to
a
generation
in
which
using
the
words
of
a
french
academician
the
mainspring
of
joy
had
been
broken
but
the
young
men
who
now
come
to
the
front
and
who
have
no
more
brilliant
representative
than
edmond
rostand
belong
to
another
generation
they
have
not
known
the
pangs
of
defeat
the
mutilation
of
the
beloved
fatherland
was
an
accomplished
fact
when
they
began
to
feel
and
to
think
they
viewed
french
history
not
as
concentrated
in
its
last
and
episode
but
as
spreading
through
centuries
of
heroic
deeds
oftener
illuminated
by
the
dazzling
sunshine
of
victory
than
darkened
by
the
gloom
of
defeat
they
were
growing
tired
of
hearing
it
repeated
on
all
tones
that
life
was
not
worth
living
and
they
longed
for
some
one
who
would
shout
in
a
voice
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
the
whole
world
let
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
in
the
acclaim
that
greeted
cyrano
de
bergerac
on
december
therefore
there
was
something
more
than
applause
for
a
great
dramatic
work
there
was
gratitude
for
the
poet
who
had
dispelled
at
last
the
atmosphere
of
sadness
which
had
come
to
be
stifling
for
the
young
frenchmen
of
our
time
the
period
of
deep
mourning
was
proclaimed
to
be
over
glances
towards
the
past
were
again
declared
to
be
indulged
in
only
as
inspirations
for
the
future
the
glory
the
joyfulness
of
action
again
appeared
as
living
realities
not
as
the
deceptive
dreams
of
unsuspecting
ignorance
thus
cyrano
presented
to
the
french
a
play
such
as
they
had
not
seen
for
a
long
time
there
had
been
plenty
of
problem
plays
or
à
as
the
french
say
cyrano
was
a
à
seldom
has
indeed
the
purpose
of
a
dramatist
been
more
clearly
pointed
out
than
in
cyrano
when
the
hero
of
the
play
breathes
his
last
after
an
imaginary
fight
with
all
the
unworthy
traits
of
human
nature
and
society
which
he
had
antagonized
during
his
checkered
life
the
one
thing
which
he
informs
his
friends
can
not
be
taken
from
him
which
he
will
proudly
carry
to
the
very
presence
of
god
is
his
and
this
is
the
last
word
and
as
it
were
the
affabulation
of
the
drama
now
what
is
this
upon
which
cyrano
sets
such
a
high
value
to
understand
it
is
to
appreciate
to
miss
it
is
to
miss
the
meaning
of
the
play
an
explanation
of
it
is
therefore
not
out
of
place
in
this
introduction
the
is
an
external
quality
which
adds
colour
and
brilliancy
to
internal
things
already
worth
having
for
their
own
intrinsic
value
its
main
justification
is
personal
bravery
to
take
an
example
the
generals
of
the
french
revolution
the
marshals
of
napoleon
army
all
possessed
personal
bravery
to
a
high
degree
they
were
not
all
distinguished
by
the
some
of
them
indeed
marshal
davout
for
instance
were
strikingly
devoid
of
it
the
representative
of
the
among
them
was
essentially
murat
the
is
literally
a
high
plume
or
bunch
of
plumes
that
waves
high
above
a
commander
murat
was
bravery
itself
but
he
had
to
be
as
conspicuous
as
possible
he
dressed
as
gorgeously
as
he
could
he
rode
a
superb
charger
and
rode
it
superbly
his
fur
cap
was
always
surmounted
by
a
high
and
richly
coloured
plume
which
was
always
discerned
just
where
the
battle
most
fiercely
raged
not
his
the
deeply
laid
and
skilfully
carried
out
plans
but
the
brilliant
and
heroic
cavalry
charge
his
eyes
his
very
voice
irrespective
of
what
he
said
were
an
inspiration
to
his
men
and
dispelled
all
fear
of
death
there
is
magnetism
in
the
and
readers
may
remember
that
a
few
years
ago
an
american
statesman
whom
his
friends
proclaimed
to
be
magnetic
if
nothing
else
was
known
throughout
the
land
as
the
plumed
knight
rally
round
my
white
panache
henry
the
fourth
said
to
his
soldiers
you
will
find
it
always
on
the
path
of
honour
and
duty
the
too
is
essentially
joyful
cyrano
is
joyful
in
spite
of
a
life
that
would
breed
discouragement
and
bitterness
in
almost
any
heart
but
his
if
reality
denies
him
his
share
of
happiness
then
he
will
find
it
in
the
domain
the
ideal
he
will
not
have
to
go
without
it
and
here
we
strike
another
cause
of
cyrano
success
it
is
not
simply
a
play
it
is
a
poem
and
poetry
always
leads
us
towards
the
ideal
this
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
reasons
underlying
the
love
of
the
french
for
a
verse
play
the
very
swing
of
its
verbal
development
lifts
us
above
the
trivialities
of
daily
life
one
might
almost
say
that
the
verse
play
is
as
characteristic
of
the
french
as
the
wagnerian
lyric
drama
is
of
the
germans
corneille
racine
hugo
molière
himself
in
such
a
play
as
are
idealists
and
their
message
to
the
world
at
large
to
which
must
now
be
added
that
of
the
brilliant
author
of
cyrano
tells
of
things
better
than
those
we
see
around
us
of
things
of
beauty
which
it
lies
in
every
one
of
us
to
bring
somewhat
nearer
to
our
touch
if
we
will
only
have
the
courage
to
live
up
to
them
a
few
words
now
about
the
new
rendering
of
the
play
which
is
here
presented
to
the
public
a
number
of
translations
of
cyrano
have
appeared
before
this
one
if
the
facts
were
known
however
it
would
perhaps
appear
that
charles
renauld
is
the
earliest
of
all
it
was
undertaken
by
its
author
under
the
spell
cast
upon
the
french
mind
by
the
sudden
revelation
of
rostand
genius
the
nature
and
causes
of
which
it
has
been
the
purpose
of
this
production
to
elucidate
the
shakespearian
character
of
the
play
displayed
in
the
freedom
with
which
the
author
brings
in
everything
that
seems
to
him
likely
to
complete
the
portrait
of
his
hero
has
been
recognised
by
the
translator
as
is
shown
by
his
use
of
a
combination
of
prose
and
verse
passages
a
real
translator
must
be
equally
at
home
in
the
language
of
the
work
translated
and
in
the
language
into
which
he
translates
it
he
must
be
in
thorough
sympathy
with
the
mental
attitudes
of
the
two
nations
whose
speeches
he
is
transmuting
one
into
the
other
he
must
be
able
to
be
a
component
atom
of
that
collective
being
the
public
on
one
side
as
well
as
on
the
other
of
the
national
frontiers
that
divide
them
thus
only
will
he
be
able
to
discover
the
means
that
will
produce
upon
the
reader
of
the
translation
the
impression
first
received
by
contact
with
the
original
the
readers
of
renauld
translation
will
it
is
thought
acknowledge
that
he
possesses
in
a
high
degree
the
qualifications
and
that
he
has
been
peculiarly
felicitous
when
the
text
did
not
lend
itself
to
translation
proper
in
devising
what
may
be
termed
adequate
equivalents
of
the
faithfulness
of
his
rendering
those
acquainted
with
the
french
language
will
easily
judge
as
they
can
have
under
the
same
cover
the
english
of
the
translator
and
the
french
of
the
dramatist
and
they
will
thus
it
is
hoped
acquire
a
clear
and
adequate
conception
of
the
beautiful
picture
which
thanks
to
edmond
rostand
has
restored
life
and
brilliancy
to
the
somewhat
faded
features
of
that
eccentric
philosopher
poet
hero
and
gentleman
savinien
hercule
de
cyrano
bergerac
adolphe
cohn
the
author
of
this
translation
trusts
that
he
is
not
presuming
too
much
if
despite
his
aversion
for
anything
akin
to
offensive
thought
and
mention
of
self
he
claims
the
privilege
of
prefacing
the
result
here
presented
of
his
labours
with
a
few
remarks
not
as
a
plea
domo
but
as
an
explanation
relating
to
the
motives
and
to
the
methods
by
which
he
was
guided
in
his
work
first
of
all
he
desires
to
state
that
this
his
version
of
edmond
rostand
cyrano
de
bergerac
was
written
in
the
early
part
of
and
copyrighted
in
washington
long
before
any
other
rendering
in
english
of
the
beautiful
and
now
celebrated
play
was
either
published
or
performed
why
did
he
withhold
it
until
now
simply
because
edmond
rostand
with
whom
he
was
not
in
touch
had
innocently
or
under
insufficient
advice
neglected
to
copyright
in
the
united
states
and
had
meanwhile
made
arrangements
for
the
performance
of
the
play
in
america
was
the
writer
who
has
long
been
and
is
still
battling
for
a
better
protection
of
literary
property
to
interfere
with
or
even
seem
in
any
way
to
invade
these
arrangements
he
thought
not
despite
solicitations
to
the
contrary
true
that
armed
with
the
valid
copyright
of
his
own
work
and
with
many
technicalities
at
his
disposal
he
could
have
brought
about
considerable
litigation
in
his
own
behalf
that
would
possibly
have
resulted
in
an
indirect
defence
of
rostand
moral
rights
still
subsisting
but
in
the
face
of
a
very
doubtful
issue
in
the
courts
with
a
possible
charge
of
officiousness
out
of
them
he
thought
it
wiser
to
abstain
allowing
time
meanwhile
to
accomplish
its
work
of
adjustment
others
however
apparently
satisfied
with
safety
for
a
justification
have
not
treated
with
the
same
respect
rostand
moral
rights
and
the
arrangements
made
by
him
for
the
american
production
of
his
cyrano
de
bergerac
the
play
has
been
mutilated
adapted
or
improved
to
suit
there
are
just
now
it
is
said
some
twenty
stock
companies
presenting
it
in
different
cities
throughout
the
united
states
the
original
in
french
has
been
openly
reprinted
here
likewise
its
british
translation
and
other
translations
have
been
offered
to
the
public
rostand
did
not
copyright
hence
the
result
of
his
labours
of
his
genius
belongs
it
would
seem
to
whoever
chooses
to
pick
it
up
in
these
circumstances
and
now
there
certainly
can
be
no
impropriety
in
the
publication
of
this
work
the
more
so
as
rostand
is
to
receive
in
this
instance
the
royalties
to
which
he
is
morally
entitled
further
even
who
knows
but
that
this
version
in
book
form
or
produced
on
the
stage
the
right
to
perform
it
having
been
expressly
reserved
by
the
writer
may
not
assist
in
setting
aside
the
different
versions
that
now
interfere
with
rostand
moral
rights
as
well
as
with
the
arrangements
he
chose
to
make
for
stage
production
in
america
diffidence
would
prevent
the
translator
were
it
not
for
the
valuable
encouragement
he
has
received
from
adding
that
the
present
version
of
cyrano
de
bergerac
may
perchance
better
than
any
of
the
renderings
in
english
now
extant
lead
to
an
adequate
conception
of
the
beauties
of
the
work
in
french
at
all
events
those
who
were
consulted
including
the
eminent
publishers
and
the
distinguished
writer
of
the
introduction
to
this
book
freely
agreed
with
the
author
in
his
opinion
that
publication
under
the
foregoing
conditions
could
do
no
harm
while
it
might
effect
considerable
good
were
it
only
as
an
example
in
many
respects
proving
among
other
things
that
there
are
those
even
in
america
for
whom
impunity
does
not
constitute
right
but
enough
talk
of
shop
perhaps
too
much
for
the
irritabile
at
this
point
the
author
feels
that
if
he
expatiated
on
his
methods
of
translation
he
might
with
some
justice
be
accused
of
tiresome
insistence
or
to
put
it
more
gently
of
obduracy
in
esoterism
he
will
therefore
confine
himself
to
a
few
statements
and
make
them
as
short
as
possible
this
version
of
cyrano
de
bergerac
was
written
originally
for
the
stage
where
according
to
opinion
behind
as
well
as
before
the
curtain
in
america
at
least
verse
may
be
acceptable
for
the
expression
of
occasional
flights
of
thought
but
not
through
the
whole
of
a
play
and
especially
not
for
such
portions
of
a
play
as
are
necessarily
colloquial
to
explain
this
alleged
distaste
for
verse
on
the
stage
would
lead
us
far
beyond
the
limits
of
a
preface
suffice
it
then
to
say
reserving
developments
for
some
future
occasion
that
for
poetic
emotion
english
verse
is
more
than
the
french
dependent
on
form
on
expression
in
other
words
english
verse
is
less
than
the
french
free
to
consider
only
thought
or
substance
irrespective
of
words
or
construction
as
a
rule
then
it
would
seem
in
english
that
dress
comes
first
and
figure
next
while
in
french
the
order
appears
to
be
reversed
in
consequence
and
setting
aside
the
fact
that
there
exists
a
magic
of
words
that
has
been
an
and
frequent
deceiver
of
men
the
average
reader
or
listener
instinctively
expects
from
english
verse
a
somewhat
conventional
language
diversified
with
unusual
words
and
exceptional
contractions
inversions
etc
it
follows
that
when
this
special
phraseology
and
peculiar
construction
are
applied
to
everyday
thoughts
facts
occurrences
and
sentiments
the
effect
produced
is
not
an
agreeable
one
by
reason
of
a
sort
of
clash
the
appearance
of
a
thing
of
prose
and
overdressed
in
verse
in
a
word
unnaturalness
further
the
majority
of
actors
unavoidably
imbued
with
the
same
spirit
so
soon
as
they
deal
with
verse
unconsciously
resort
to
a
stilted
diction
that
is
distressingly
from
the
art
that
consists
through
tedious
and
patient
work
in
being
natural
natural
unconstrained
verse
can
with
proper
care
it
is
thought
be
written
in
english
and
can
certainly
with
appropriate
training
be
delivered
with
naturalness
this
done
our
audiences
would
no
doubt
take
kindly
to
the
rhythm
of
plays
in
verse
but
as
this
does
not
yet
seem
to
have
been
fully
accomplished
the
undersigned
translator
of
cyrano
de
bergerac
reluctantly
decided
to
use
both
verse
and
prose
for
this
liberty
though
justified
as
above
he
feels
that
he
owes
the
french
poet
an
apology
adding
however
that
the
deed
brought
its
own
punishment
since
strange
as
it
may
appear
to
some
it
would
have
been
much
easier
to
render
the
play
all
in
verse
as
to
verse
and
metrics
on
which
in
this
instance
a
book
could
and
later
may
be
written
the
author
of
this
translation
must
now
rest
satisfied
with
the
following
brief
remarks
enlightened
by
considerable
experience
the
result
of
many
experiments
and
after
much
thought
he
adopted
blank
pentameter
as
the
true
equivalent
in
english
of
french
riming
alexandrine
verse
first
because
in
english
frequent
elisions
making
many
syllables
heavy
and
run
on
lines
practically
adding
to
the
number
of
syllables
the
line
of
english
verse
is
in
reality
the
counterpart
of
the
verse
in
french
and
second
because
the
object
of
rime
being
not
to
repeat
a
given
sound
but
to
the
strongly
accentuated
syllables
of
english
as
compared
with
the
very
much
more
even
enunciation
of
french
are
quite
sufficient
without
rime
or
assonance
to
thus
he
avoided
at
least
one
criticism
to
wit
rime
is
monotonous
touching
metrics
the
writer
will
here
go
only
one
step
in
the
ways
of
heresy
by
stating
that
in
his
opinion
such
words
as
our
hour
fire
should
be
as
in
french
duel
hier
counted
for
one
syllable
or
for
two
syllables
according
to
rhythm
as
influenced
by
the
stronger
or
weaker
emphasis
called
for
by
the
of
the
word
this
could
be
elucidated
by
examples
the
place
of
which
however
is
not
here
more
generally
as
to
methods
the
writer
makes
free
to
state
that
exerting
himself
to
avoid
translation
too
often
productive
of
laughable
nonsense
and
translation
frequently
a
substitution
of
the
translator
for
the
author
thoughts
he
endeavoured
as
in
previous
works
of
the
same
nature
to
give
what
he
has
termed
an
translation
in
other
words
he
strove
to
remain
really
true
to
the
original
by
creating
in
detail
as
well
as
in
a
general
way
in
english
words
on
english
minds
the
caused
by
french
words
on
french
minds
some
examples
of
the
at
least
sought
for
will
be
found
in
the
on
several
pages
of
this
book
as
to
le
panache
that
surmounts
this
masterpiece
cyrano
de
bergerac
of
which
it
is
the
main
feature
sending
through
it
a
breath
of
joyful
daring
quand
même
the
writer
sought
as
will
be
seen
to
describe
it
in
triolets
these
too
might
need
to
be
explained
were
it
not
for
the
able
commentary
to
be
found
in
the
introduction
so
kindly
written
for
this
book
by
one
of
the
most
learned
and
esteemed
professors
of
our
columbia
university
the
writer
trusts
that
he
may
be
pardoned
for
going
at
such
length
into
some
of
the
minutiæ
of
his
task
and
he
certainly
should
be
acquitted
if
he
thereby
succeeded
in
showing
how
much
labour
must
be
expended
to
produce
even
a
tolerable
translation
and
consequently
how
little
justice
is
very
often
done
to
translators
in
general
he
commends
these
details
to
his
friends
as
an
inducement
to
think
a
while
before
they
leap
or
rather
jump
at
conclusions
were
he
less
charitably
disposed
or
more
eager
for
a
practical
demonstration
he
could
say
to
them
simply

short
plump
and
jovial
looking
here
ragueneau
lignière
the
celebrated
poulterer
and
ragueneau
his
best
clothes
going
up
to
sir
have
you
seen
monsieur
de
cyrano
lignière
ragueneau
to
the
caterer
of
comedians
and
poets
ragueneau
flattered
indeed
lignière
come
come
you
mæcenas
ragueneau
they
honour
me
with
their
custom
lignière
but
seldom
pay
a
good
poet
himself
ragueneau
they
say
so
lignière
enthusiastic
for
verse
ragueneau
the
fact
is
that
for
a
short
poem
lignière
you
willingly
give
a
pie
ragueneau
a
small
tart
only
lignière
good
fellow
he
excuses
himself
and
for
a
triolet
did
you
not
give
ragueneau
only
a
few
rolls
lignière
and
the
stage
you
like
it
ragueneau
i
love
it
lignière
and
you
buy
your
way
in
with
your
cakes
ragueneau
oh
so
few
but
i
am
surprised
not
to
see
monsieur
de
cyrano
lignière
why
so
ragueneau
because
montfleury
plays
lignière
that
talking
hogshead
true
he
plays
phédon
but
what
cares
cyrano
ragueneau
do
you
know
monsieur
de
cyrano
has
taken
an
aversion
for
him
and
gentlemen
has
forbidden
him
to
appear
on
the
stage
for
a
whole
month
lignière
his
fourth
well
then
ragueneau
oh
i
only
came
to
see
what
is
going
to
happen
first
marquis
has
come
up
meanwhile
with
who
is
this
cyrano
cuigy
a
capital
swordsman
second
marquis
of
noble
birth
cuigy
sufficiently
so
he
is
a
cadet
in
the
guards
a
gentleman
who
appears
to
be
seeking
but
here
his
friend
le
bret
le
bret
bret
comes
you
are
looking
for
bergerac
le
bret
yes
and
with
some
anxiety
cuigy
am
i
not
right
in
stating
that
he
is
no
ordinary
man
le
bret
he
is
the
most
exquisite
of
creatures
sublunary
ragueneau
a
rimester
cuigy
a
swordsman
brissaille
a
scientist
le
bret
a
musician
lignière
but
how
strange
is
his
appearance
ragueneau
no
solemn
painter
like
philip
de
champaigne
probably
will
ever
give
us
a
portrait
of
him
but
he
is
so
odd
extravagant
wild
and
strange
that
he
could
well
have
served
jacques
callot
as
a
model
for
the
most
erratic
of
his
fighting
heroes
hat
astounding
doublet
cloak
whose
folds
a
sword
draws
up
behind
in
stateliness
like
the
saucy
tail
of
a
cock
prouder
than
the
proudest
of
numberless
haughty
sons
he
wears
above
his
pulcinella
ruff
a
nose
ah
mylords
what
a
nose
is
that
nose
it
is
impossible
in
presence
of
such
a
not
to
think
this
really
is
exaggeration
then
you
will
smile
and
think
of
course
he
take
it
off
but
monsieur
de
bergerac
never
takes
it
off
le
bret
never
but
whoever
notices
that
nose
he
wears
is
sure
to
get
a
swordthrust
for
the
attention
ragueneau
his
sword
is
one
of
the
two
blades
of
the
fatal
sisters
scissors
first
marquis
his
he
will
not
come
ragueneau
oh
yes
he
will
i
bet
a
chicken
la
ragueneau
of
admiration
as
roxane
appears
in
her
box
where
she
takes
a
seat
in
front
while
her
duenna
sits
behind
her
christian
busy
paying
the
does
not
notice
her
second
marquis
oh
gentlemen
she
is
frightfully
lovely
first
marquis
a
peach
divine
smiling
in
a
nest
of
strawberries
second
marquis
so
refreshing
that
she
might
give
one
a
cold
in
the
heart
christian
roxane
and
clutching
lignière
it
she
lignière
so
this
is
your
deity

speak
quickly
i
tremble
lignière
sipping
his
magdeleine
robin
otherwise
roxane
refined
and
quick
a
précieuse
christian
alas
lignière
independent
an
orphan
cousin
of
cyrano
whom
you
heard
mentioned
just
now
gentleman
very
finely
dressed
wearing
a
blue
ribbon
crosswise
from
shoulder
to
waist
enters
the
box
and
remains
engaged
in
conversation
with
christian
that
man
lignière
intoxicated
ha
ha
the
count
de
guiche
very
much
in
love
with
her
but
he
is
the
husband
of
richelieu
niece
and
he
is
urging
roxane
to
marry
rather
a
sorry
fellow
monsieur
de
valvert
who
is
both
of
noble
birth
and
accommodating
she
resists
but
guiche
has
influence
i
wrote
a
song
on
the
subject
no
doubt
he
bears
me
a
grudge
for
it
the
end
is
cutting
just
listen
rises
holding
up
his
glass
ready
to
christian
no
i
must
leave
lignière
and
you
are
going

might
kill

astonished

it
not

i
am
going

let
my

loose
in
the
alexandrine
verse
adopted
here
and
further
on

ii
as
being
more
pompous
the
words
you
kick
in
the
place
of
tu
récalcitres
were
suggested
by
a
friend
as
a
better
translation
but
the
good
critic
failed
to
realise
that
cyrano
does
not
use
slang
and
is
almost
always
on
the
contrary
somewhat
hyperbolic
addicted
to
willful
oddity
of
récalcitrant
doggedly
resisting
is
frequently
used
in
french
but
the
infinitive
récalcitrer
though
it
exists
and
the
other
forms
of
the
verb
are
seldom
if
ever
cyrano
therefore
calls
up
a
smile
if
not
a
laugh
by
resorting
to
the
verb
in
the
second
person
singular
present
is
a
good
english
word
see
longfellow
but
it
is
so
seldom
used
that
it
creates
on
the
english
ear
the
same
impression
of
amused
surprise
that
is
induced
by
the
original
cyrano
bellerose
jodelet
montfleury
the

reach
cyrano
not
so
long
as
mine
his
with
this
extension
now
go
about
your
business
the
intruder
but
allow
me
cyrano
go
or
rather
tell
me
why
you
look
so
sharply
at
my
nose
the
intruder
what
i
cyrano
is
there
anything
extraordinary
about
it
the
intruder
your
lordship
mistakes
cyrano
is
it
soft
and
swinging
like
an
elephant
trunk
the
intruder
i
did
not
say
cyrano
or
crooked
like
the
beak
of
an
owl
the
intruder
no
i
cyrano
is
there
a
wart
on
the
end
of
it
or
a
fly
what
amiss
with
it
or
is
it
a
phenomenon
the
intruder
why
i
did
even
look
at
it
cyrano
why
should
you
look
at
it
is
it
repulsive
the
intruder
my
dear
sir
cyrano
in
colour
unhealthy
in
shape
indecent
the
intruder
not
at
all
cyrano
why
then
seem
to
revile
it
perhaps
the
gentleman
finds
it
rather
large
the
intruder
i
find
it
small
very
very
small
cyrano
how
small
ridiculously
then
my
nose
small
why
my
nose
is
enormous
remember
vile
and
that
i
am
proud
of
such
an
appendix
for
a
large
nose
properly
indicates
a
man
that
is
affable
kind
courteous
witty
liberal
and
brave
such
as
i
am
and
such
as
you
miserable
knave
can
never
be
for
the
inglorious
face
that
my
hand
is
about
to
seek
above
your
collar
is
as
destitute
slaps
intruder
the
intruder
oh
cyrano
of
pride
of
flight
of
poesy
of
picturesqueness
of
fire
of
magnificence
of
nose
in
fact
as
the
one
seizes
the
intruder
by
the
shoulders
and
kicks
him
in
the
that
my
boot
now
reaches
at
the
base
of
your
back
the
intruder
help
guards
cyrano
fair
warning
then
to
idle
lookers
on
who
criticise
the
centre
of
my
face
the
critic
if
a
gentleman
will
get
before
he
flies
in
front
and
higher
too
my
custom
such
some
steel
instead
of
leather
guiche
with
the
marquises
has
come
down
from
the
the
gentleman
is
getting
very
tiresome
vicomte
de
valvert
his
he
is
a
braggart
guiche
and
no
one
answers
him
the
vicomte
no
one
just
wait
such
a
retort
as
i
going
to
send
him
advances
toward
cyrano
who
has
been
looking
at
him
and
draws
himself
up
with
an
air
of
foppish
you
you
have
a
nose
hum
a
nose
sir
that
is
very
large
cyrano
quietly
and
very
large
indeed
vicomte
ha
ha
cyrano
great
is
that
all
vicomte
well
i
cyrano
no
no
that
a
little
too
short
young
man
you
might
have
said
well
many
things
in
different
keys
for
instance
listen
i
sir
had
i
such
a
nose
would
at
once
have
it
amputated
it
must
dip
into
your
glass
to
drink
with
comfort
you
should
have
a
hanap
constructed
it
is
a
rock
a
peak
a
headland
more
than
a
headland
a
whole
peninsula
what
may
this
oblong
thing
be
used
for
a
or
a
do
you
love
birds
so
much
that
you
feel
bound
to
offer
them
so
comfortable
a
resting
place
when
you
use
tobacco
sir
can
you
emit
smoke
from
that
nose
without
your
neighbours
crying
that
there
is
a
chimney
on
fire
be
careful
so
much
might
cause
you
to
fall
have
a
parasol
made
for
it
the
sun
might
fade
its
colour
for
so
much
flesh
on
so
much
bone
beneath
the
forehead
we
must
go
back
sir
to
the
animal
aristophanes
calls
hippocampelephantocamelos
why
man
is
that
the
fashion
for
hooks
certainly
convenient
for
hanging
up
a
hat
masterly
nose
no
wind
can
make
you
catch
aught
but
a
fractional
cold
none
but
a
northern
hurricane
when
it
bleeds
we
have
the
red
sea
for
a
perfumer
what
a
sign
is
it
a
shell
trumpet
and
are
you
a
triton
when
is
this
monument
open
to
visitors
this
is
really
owning
a
mansion
with
a
gable
on
it
that
be
not
a
nose
but
a
big
turnip
or
a
young
melon
point
against
cavalry
will
you
put
it
up
in
a
lottery
it
will
surely
be
the
largest
prize
finally
to
parody
the
grief
of
pyramus
so
here
we
have
the
nose
that
on
its
master
came
to
ruin
harmony
the
traitor
red
for
shame
that
is
about
what
you
might
have
said
dear
boy
if
you
had
a
sprinkling
of
letters
and
a
bit
of
humour
of
humour
though
lamentable
being
you
never
had
an
atom
and
as
to
letters
you
never
had
but
the
four
that
spell
the
word
fool
some
invention
is
requisite
for
extravagant
jests
before
such
an
audience
but
even
if
you
had
it
you
could
not
have
uttered
a
quarter
of
the
half
of
the
beginning
of
what
i
said
for
i
may
be
willing
to
serve
such
sport
myself
but
i
allow
nobody
to
serve
it
to
guiche
to
lead
away
the
vicomte
pay
no
attention
to
him
vicomte
such
arrogance
an
insignificant
little
squire
who
who
does
even
wear
gloves
who
sallies
forth
without
ribbons
bows
or
trimmings
cyrano
is
morally
i
have
my
elegance
i
do
not
dress
as
does
a
fop
but
i
am
better
groomed
than
some
more
richly
clad
i
not
set
forth
with
traces
of
neglect
about
me
say
an
insult
left
unwashed
a
conscience
still
confused
and
half
asleep
my
honour
soiled
or
scruples
out
of
shape
when
i
proceed
i
do
so
clean
and
bright
with
truthful
independence
for
a
plume
is
not
my
form
i
lace
to
hold
it
up
it
is
my
soul
i
try
to
elevate
the
ribbons
that
i
wear
are
only
deeds
i
twist
perhaps
my
wit
like
a
mustache
but
then
i
cause
as
i
go
through
your
groups
above
the
clash
of
spurs
the
truth
to
ring
vicomte
but
sir
cyrano
i
have
no
gloves
on
what
matters
it
i
did
have
one
left
from
a
very
old
pair

day

somewhat
in

i
feel
very
hungry
well
you
were
saying
le
bret
that
all
these
bellicose
doings
and
the
admiration
they
elicit
will
warp
your
judgment
go
ask
people
of

what
they
think
of
this
last
prank
of
yours
of
its
effect
cyrano
his
half
enormous
le

the

with
he
was
there
the
cardinal
le

yes
and
he
must
have
found
you

anything
but
commonplace
le

nevertheless
cyrano
he
an
author
and
he
must
have
enjoyed
seeing
another
play
crushed
le

you
are
really
making
too
many
enemies
cyrano
his
one
how
many
do
you
estimate
i
have
made
le

without
counting
the
women
cyrano
enumerate
them
le
bret
montfleury
the
tradesman
guiche
the
vicomte
baro
the
academy
cyrano
you
give
me
infinite
joy
le
bret
what
will
all
this
lead
you
to
what
system
is
yours
cyrano
i
was
really
meandering
and
i
found
so
many
conclusions
to
adopt
through
so
many
complications
that
i
came
to
this
decision
le
bret
which
is
cyrano
oh
the
simplest
of
all
by
far
i
decided
to
show
myself
admirable
in
all
and
for
all
le
bret
his
so
be
it
but
come
now
tell
me
tell
the
true
reason
of
your
hatred
for
montfleury
cyrano
this
silenus
with
a
stomach
like
a
hogshead
still
believes
himself
a
danger
to
womankind
see
him
while
he
stammers
on
the
stage
ogling
like
a
carp
with
his
frog
eyes
i
hate
him
since
he
dared
once
to
set
those
eyes
of
his
upon
her
oh
i
felt
as
if
i
saw
a
long
slug
crawling
over
a
flower
le
bret
what
is
it
possible
cyrano
a
bitter
that
i
love
to
a
solemn
i
do
love
le
bret
whom
may
i
enquire
you
never
told
me
cyrano
whom
i
love
come
now
reflect
the
dream
of
being
loved
even
by
a
homely
girl
is
one
forbidden
me
forbidden
by
this
nose
of
mine
that
precedes
me
everywhere
by
fifteen
minutes
so
then
i
love
whom
why
it
is
most
natural
i
love
it
could
not
be
otherwise
the
loveliest
of
the
lovely
le
bret
the
loveliest
cyrano
exactly
in
the
world
the
most
brilliant
the
most
exquisite
the
blondest
le
bret
this
woman
is
cyrano
a
deadly
danger
though
she
knows
it
not
a
snare
that
nature
made
unconscious
like
a
sweetly
budding
rose
whose
leaves
conceal
in
ambush
lurking
love
who
sees
her
smile
knows
what
perfection
is
her
slightest
touch
engenders
loveliness
she
moves
as
if
all
heaven
grace
were
hers
and
venus
embarked
in
any
shell
nor
did
diana
tread
the
sylvan
paths
as
my
adored
can
step
into
a
chair
le
bret
i
understand
quite
clear
cyrano
transparent
say
le
bret
it
magdeleine
your
cousin
cyrano
yes
roxane
le
bret
well
where
the
harm
you
love
her
tell
her
so
she
witnessed
here
just
now
your
valiant
deed
cyrano
why
look
at
me
good
friend
and
say
what
hope
there
can
be
with
such
a
protuberance
i
clearly
see
the
truth
but
then
of
course
my
heart
will
beat
perchance
at
eventide
if
with
this
nose
i
scent
the
breath
of
spring
or
else
i
see
along
some
moonlit
path
a
pair
of
lovers
slowly
move
and
then
i
think
what
rapture
would
be
mine
if
on
my
arm
a
gentle
creature
leaned
i
dream
but
suddenly
i
brought
to
sense
by
what
alas
my
profile
on
the
wall
le
bret
dear
friend
cyrano
yes
friend
it
hard
indeed
to
feel
so
homely
and
forlorn
at
times
le
bret
his
you
weep
cyrano
weep
never
oh
a
sorry
sight
indeed
if
down
this
nose
a
tear
should
take
its
course
i
will
not
have
so
long
as
i
command
the
saintliness
of
tears
polluted
by
this
homeliness
of
mine
remember
friend
that
nothing
more
sublime
than
flowing
tears
so
would
i
not
allow
a
single
one
to
cause
a
laugh
or
seem
ridiculous
le
bret
come
come
do
not
be
sad
in
love
there
is
hazard
remember
cyrano
his
no
i
love
cleopatra
do
i
resemble
a
cæsar
i
adore
berenice
do
i
look
like

very
much
for

i
forbid
that

i
thank
you
heartily
for

you
now
the
fop
the
brainless
wretch
you
vanquished
yesterday
in
noble
strife
was
being
forced
upon
me
a
mate
for
life
by
one
who
says
he
loves
me
cyrano
guiche
who
good
at
scheming
thus
so
then
i
fought
not
for
my
nose
but
for
your
smiling
eyes
roxane
and
then
i
wished
but
the
admission
needs
that
i
should
find
in
you
the
brother
that
you
were
of
yore
we
were
children
both
cyrano
when
bergerac
was
our
summer
ground
roxane
and
reeds
made
up
your
goodly
stock
of
swords
cyrano
while
waving
corn
gave
flowing
hair
for
dolls
roxane
what
happy
days
for
you
my
will
was
law
cyrano
you
now
roxane
you
then
were
madeleine
roxane
and
pretty
cyrano
you
were
not
a
sorry
sight
roxane
how
often
romping
you
would
get
a
hurt
then
motherly
i
say
in
sternest
voice
another
frolic
and
another
scratch
stops
the
same
what
this
tries
to
withdraw
his
no
let
me
see
you
still
a
boy
it
say
when
and
how
cyrano
at
play
just
now
around
the
porte
de
nesle
roxane
a
seat
at
one
of
the
tables
and
wetting
her
handkerchief
in
a
glass
of
your
hand
cyrano
a
seat
near
how
gently
thoughtful
you
remained
roxane
how
many
foes
cyrano
not
quite
a
hundred
roxane
oh
do
tell
me
all
cyrano
what
for
it
better
far
you
tell
me
what
you
did
not
dare
to
say
roxane
but
now
i
dare
the
memories
of
yore
assist
me
i
love
with
somebody
cyrano
indeed
roxane
who
knows
it
not
cyrano
indeed
roxane
not
yet
cyrano
indeed
roxane
but
he
shall
know
it
soon
cyrano
indeed
roxane
poor
fellow
he
has
loved
me
timidly
and
from
afar
and
never
dared
to
speak
cyrano
indeed
roxane
your
hand
is
feverish
oh
i
easily
could
see
the
truth
beneath
his
bashfulness
cyrano
indeed
roxane
she
finished
bandaging
his
and
see
what
a
coincidence
dear
cousin
he
belongs
to
your
regiment
cyrano
indeed
roxane
why
of
course
he
is
a
cadet
in
your
company
cyrano
indeed
roxane
he
bears
on
his
brow
the
mark
of
intelligence
of
genius
he
is
haughty
noble
young
intrepid
handsome
cyrano
very
handsome
roxane
why
what
is
the
matter
cyrano
the
matter
nothing
it
is
it
is
his
hand
and
this
little
scratch
roxane
oh
well
i
really
love
him
i
must
say
however
that
i
have
seen
him
only
at
the
theatre
cyrano
then
you
have
not
spoken
to
each
other
roxane
our
eyes
alone
have
done
the
talking
cyrano
well
then
how
do
you
know
roxane
beneath
the
linden
trees
of
the
place
royal
there
is
some
gossipping
and
information
has
reached
me
cyrano
he
is
a
cadet
you
say
roxane
yes
a
cadet
in
the
guards
cyrano
his
name
roxane
baron
christian
de
neuvillette
cyrano
how
there
is
nobody
of
that
name
among
the
cadets
roxane
oh
yes
there
is
since
this
morning
his
captain
is
carbon
of
cyrano
and
so
quick
quick
we
throw
away
our
little
heart
but
my
poor
child
the
duenna
in
at
the
monsieur
de
bergerac
i
have
finished
the
cakes
cyrano
well
then
read
the
verses
that
you
will
find
on
the
bags
my
poor
child
for
you
who
are
accustomed
to
refined
language
to
subtle
thoughts
suppose
he
were
thoroughly
uninitiated
in
fact
a
savage
roxane
oh
no
he
has
the
hair
of
a
hero
cyrano
suppose
he
were
as
poor
in
speech
as
rich
in
hair
roxane
no
all
his
words
are
choice
i
can
tell
by
seeing
him
cyrano
of
course
all
words
are
choice
when
they
come
through
a
mustache
that
is
well
but
suppose
he
were
a
dunce
roxane
the
floor
with
her
foot
well
it
would
kill
me
there
cyrano
a
and
it
is
to
tell
me
this
that
you
asked
me
to
meet
you
here
i
fail
to
see
the
necessity
of
the
appointment
madam
roxane
the
fact
is
that
somebody
frightened
me
yesterday
by
telling
me
that
you
are
all
gascons
in
your
company
cyrano
and
that
we
challenge
any
beardless
hero
who
through
influence
and
not
being
really
a
gascon
manages
to
get
assigned
to
our
gascon
company
that
is
what
you
were
told
roxane
and
you
imagine
how
i
tremble
for
him
cyrano
his
not
without
good
reason
roxane
but
then
i
was
reminded
of
you
and
of
your
skill
and
courage
your
great
achievements
and
i
thought
if
he
cyrano
whom
everyone
respects
would

answer
for
your
little
baron

impossible
sir

on

my

fellow
when
a

pleases

he
pays
for

a

price
cyrano
not
so
large
a
one

i
myself
pay
when
i
have
written
a

sing
it
to

now
you
must
admit
that
this
constant

the

is
to
say
the

a
gross
exaggeration
cyrano
well
yes
i
do
exaggerate
there
le

you
see
cyrano
but
i
do
so
as
a
matter
of

such
exaggeration
is
good
le

without
a

of

or

a

unto

what
is
honestly
your

for
once
reflect
my

be
satisfied
with

or

if
they
have

strictly
yours

if
perchance
a
bit
of
fame
is
earned
to
feel
that
none
of
it
to

due
the
truth
is
there
and
so
is
honesty
despise
to
ape
the
and
try
to
be
an
oak
or

to
rise
not
very
high
perhaps
but
rise
alone
le
bret
alone
you
right
but
not
opposing
all
why
should
you
make
so
many
enemies
cyrano
because
i
see
you
make
so
many
friends
and
smile
on
them
with
mouths
i
not
describe
i
glad
to
pass
with
fewer
greetings
met
and
proud
to
think
another
enemy
le
bret
you
are
insane
cyrano
perhaps
my
vice
is
such
i
pleased
if
i
displease
indeed
i
love
to
gather
hatred
friend
you
never
felt
the
thrill
that
caused
by
walking
on
erect
while
fifty
pairs
of
eyes
are
sending
shot
as
if
they
were
so
many
guns
and
then
how
comical
the
spots
on
doublets
made
by
envy
gall
and
cowardice
slaver
loose
friendships
like
to
those
you
cultivate
resemble
the
italian
collars
soft
and
that
feminize
your
necks
they
easy
and
of
mien
your
head
with
them
can
bend
to
any
will
not
so
with
me
for
hatred
every
morn
makes
stiff
the
ruff
that
forces
up
my
head
an
enemy
i
gain
another
fold
that
straightens
me
the
more
perhaps
but
adds
a
beam
to
my
renown
the
spanish
ruff
though
sitting
on
the
neck
as
would
a
yoke
with
some
can
be
a
halo
the
head
le
bret
a
pause
passing
his
arm
through
speak
out
aloud
your
pride
and
bitterness
but
whisper
to
me
then
she
loves
me
not
this
is
a
gascon
oath
like
the
similar
oaths
following
it
would
if
translated
literally
blood
of
god
lose
its
picturesque
and
really
innocent
character
all
of
these
are
rather
than
oaths
and
somewhat
after
the
fashion
of
goldarn
it
in
america
the
name
in
the
original
being
indicative
of
gascon
pride
and
superlativeness
it
was
thought
better
to
translate
it
in
order
to
preserve
colour
but
here
arose
the
question
him
or
he
of
both
cases
have
their
champions
with
most
excellent
reasons
it
was
thought
however
that
argument
might
be
avoided
and
the
line
be
made
more
effective
by
the
insertion
of
a
dash
after
carbon
thus
leaving
time
for
the
imaginary
interrogation
what
carbon
following
which
suspension
the
answer
is
he
of
is
the
carbon
meant
the
text
here
justified
by
a
current
french
expression
would
be
too
broad
in
english
cyrano
le

the
cadets
christian
de
neuvillette
a
cadet
at
a
table
in
the
rear
cyrano
that
narrative
please
cyrano
yes
presently
takes
the
arm
of
le
bret
going
up
and
speaking
in
low
tone
to
the
cadet
and
coming
the
details
of
the
fight
they
will
make
the
best
kind
of
lesson
near
the
table
before
which
christian
is
for
a
timid
apprentice
christian
apprentice
another
cadet
just
so
sickly
northerner
christian
sickly
first
cadet
monsieur
de
neuvillette
there
something
you
must
learn
to
wit
there
exists
a
thing
that
with
us
must
never
be
even
alluded
to
no
more
than
a
rope
in
the
house
of
one
who
was
hung
christian
and
what
is
that
another
cadet
terrifying
look
at
me
his
finger
he
three
times
strikes
his
you
understand
christian
oh
you
mean
the
another
cadet
hush
the
word
is
never
pronounced
to
cyrano
who
in
the
rear
is
talking
with
le
or
else
trouble
is
sure
another
cadet
while
christian
was
looking
the
other
way
took
a
seat
on
the
two
men
were
killed
by
him
because
they
spoke
through
the
nose
a
subject
he
dislikes
another
cadet
up
from
underneath
the
table
where
he
had
those
who
desire
to
die
young
have
but
to
come
here
and
speak
of
the
fatal
cartilage
another
cadet
his
hand
on
christian
one
word
enough
did
i
say
a
word
one
motion
just
one
suffices
and
drawing
out
one
handkerchief
is
equivalent
to
weaving
shroud
all
the
cadets
remain
with
folded
arms
staring
at
christian
christian
goes
up
to
carbon
of
who
has
been
conversing
with
an
officer
and
affecting
not
to
notice
the
christian
captain
carbon
and
with
a
severe
sir
christian
when
one
encounters
southerners
possessed
of
too
much
braggadocio
carbon
the
right
thing
to
do
prove
to
them
that
you
may
come
from
the
north
and
still
be
brave
christian
captain
i
thank
you
first
cadet
and
now
your
narrative
other
cadets
yes
his
narrative
cyrano
down
to
my
narrative
well
here
it
is
gather
around
him
some
seated
some
standing
christian
straddles
a
well
then
i
was
walking
along
so
as
to
meet
them
the
moon
in
the
sky
looked
like
a
big
silver
watch
when
suddenly
some
zealous
i
suppose
began
passing
over
it
with
a
view
to
making
it
shine
no
doubt
some
cloudy
cotton
in
consequence
the
night
became
as
dark
as
possible
and
mordious
i
could
not
see
further
christian
than
the
end
of
your
nose
everybody
rises
slowly
frightened
and
looking
at
cyrano
whom
the
interruption
has
astounded
general
cyrano
who
is
this
man
a
cadet
subdued
one
who
joined
this
morning
cyrano
toward
this
morning
carbon
his
name
is
baron
de
neuvillette
cyrano
oh
very
well
then
turns
pale
then
reddens
and
appears
ready
to
throw
himself
upon
i
must
himself
that
is
different
as
i
was
saying
mordious
in
a
natural
i
could
not
see
very
far
stupefaction
all
take
their
seats
again
looking
at
so
i
was
walking
on
thinking
how
i
was
going
to
disappoint
some
mighty
lord
desirous
of
pulling
christian
your
nose
rises
again
while
christian
rocks
on
his
cyrano
my
ears
and
how
imprudent
some
people
might
find
me
for
thus
poking
christian
your
nose
cyrano
no
my
finger
between
the
tree
and
the
bark
for
this
great
lord
might
be
powerful
enough
to
rap
me
christian
on
the
nose
cyrano
the
perspiration
from
his
no
on
the
fingers
but
i
said
to
myself
go
ahead
gascon
do
your
duty
on
cyrano
then
abruptly
out
of
the
dark
somebody
made
a
lunge
at
me
i
parried
when
suddenly
i
found
myself
christian
nose
to
nose
cyrano
toward
ventre
saint
gris
the
gascons
advance
to
witness
the
scene
but
cyrano
on
coming
up
to
christian
masters
himself
and
continues
confronted
by
a
hundred
drunken
rascals
smelling
christian
with
their
hundred
noses
cyrano
as
death
but
of
onion
and
garlic
i
rushed
forward
blindly
christian
without
nosing
cyrano
and
charged
them
down
went
two
of
them
a
third
i
ran
through
they
lunged
i
parried
and
struck
down
how
many
christian
who
knows
cyrano
with
thunder
and
lightning
clear
the
room
cadets
rush
toward
the
first
cadet
the
tiger
wakes
cyrano
all
out
leave
me
alone
with
this
man
second
cadet
we
find
the
fellow
in
ragueneau
not
fit
though
for
my
pies
go
out
by
the
rear
the
sides
and
the
staircase
cyrano
and
christian
remain
face
to
face
staring
at
each
other
cyrano
christian
cyrano
embrace
me
christian
sir
cyrano
you
are
brave
christian
perhaps
but
cyrano
very
brave
i
prefer
it
so
christian
kindly
explain
cyrano
embrace
me
i
am
her
brother
christian
whose
brother
cyrano
her
roxane
christian
up
to
you
the
brother
of
roxane
cyrano
well
very
much
the
same
a
brotherly
cousin
christian
and
she
cyrano
told
me
all
christian
does
she
love
me
cyrano
perhaps
christian
cyrano
how
happy
i
feel
sir
to
know
you
cyrano
rather
a
sudden
sentiment
is
it
not
christian
forgive
me
but
cyrano
well
at
him
and
laying
his
hand
on
christian
it
a
fact
a
fellow
this
rascal
christian
i
only
wish
you
knew
sir
how
much
i
admire
you
cyrano
yes
but
what
of
all
those
noses
that
you
christian
i
withdraw
them
sir
cyrano
roxane
expects
a
letter
christian
that
is
the
trouble
cyrano
how
so
christian
i
am
lost
if
i
remain
silent
cyrano
well
then
christian
but
i
am
ashamed
to
own
it
i
am
too
stupid
to
write
cyrano
stupid
you
are
not
friend
since
you
realise
your
inability
moreover
your
attack
upon
me
was
not
that
of
a
dunce
christian
oh
it
is
easy
enough
to
find
words
for
a
fight
yes
perhaps
i
have
a
sort
of
easy
military
wit
but
facing
women
i
am
struck
dumb
oh
their
eyes
seem
favourable
enough
as
i
pass
them
cyrano
are
not
their
hearts
the
same
when
you
stop
christian
no
for
i
belong
to
those
and
i
know
it
who
tremble
and
know
not
how
to
speak
of
love
cyrano
strange
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
were
better
looking
i
should
belong
to
the
other
class
those
who
know
and
dare
christian
oh
that
i
could
with
elegance
express
my
feelings
cyrano
or
be
a
pretty
little
musketeer
christian
roxane
is
a
and
in
her
eyes
i
shall
be
disgraced
cyrano
at
oh
that
for
the
feelings
of
my
soul
i
had
such
an
interpreter
christian
what
would
i
not
give
for
eloquence
cyrano
i
lend
you
some
lend
you
to
me
your
physical
attraction
and
the
two
combined
will
constitute
the
hero
of
a
romance
christian
what
then
cyrano
would
you
feel
equal
to
repeating
the
daily
lessons
i
could
give
you
christian
what
is
it
you
propose
cyrano
in
roxane
eyes
you
shall
not
be
disgraced
together
if
you
will
we
can
gain
her
love
will
you
allow
the
soul
so
by
my
buckskin
here
to
breathe
and
sing
beneath
your
embroidered
doublet
christian
but
cyrano
cyrano
christian
will
you
christian
would
it
give
you
so
much
pleasure
cyrano
it
would
to
his
senses
and
it
would
amuse
me
a
trial
this
to
tempt
a
poet
come
we
shall
complete
each
other
if
you
will
you
walk
and
i
be
near
you
in
the
shade
i
be
the
breath
and
you
shall
be
the
form
christian
but
that
letter
she
expects
i
can
not
write
it
cyrano
from
his
doublet
the
letter
he
wrote
a
while
your
letter
here
it
is
christian
how
is
this
cyrano
it
lacks
nothing
but
the
address
you
may
send
it
feel
no
anxiety
it
is
as
it
should
be
christian
but
how
is
it
that
you
cyrano
we
poets
have
about
us
as
a
rule
fine
letters
to
the
women
we
adore
in
our
dreams
for
we
belong
to
those
whose
love
is
but
a
fleeting
fancy
blown
into
the
of
a
name
take
this
and
make
a
truth
of
what
is
feigned
my
rambling
words
of
rapture
flutter
like
bewildered
birds
you
cause
them
to
alight
the
letter
shows
itself
now
take
it
that
my
eloquence
was
born
of
artifice
christian
but
there
may
be
a
few
words
to
change
thus
written
at
random
will
it
fit
roxane
cyrano
it
will
fit
her
like
a
glove
human
vanity
is
so
credulous
that
roxane
will
never
doubt
the
letter
was
written
for
her
christian
you
are
my
dearest

the

with

or
we
shall
miss
the
discourse
on
the
tender
passion
voice
of
roxane
i
am
coming
of
string
instruments
growing
gradually
voice
of
cyrano
in
the
la
la
la
la
the
duenna
music
for
us
cyrano
by
two
pages
each
with
an
i
say
again
that
it
a
you
triple
fool
first
page
so
then
sir
you
have
thorough
knowledge
of
quavers
cyrano
i
am
a
musician
as
are
all
the
disciples
of
gassendi
the
page
and
la
la
cyrano
from
him
the
archlute
and
continuing
the
i
can
go
on
la
la
la
la
roxane
on
the
so
it
is
you
cyrano
the
same
yes
i
who
come
to
celebrate
the
lily
and
to
extol
the
glory
of
the
ro
roxane
i
be
down
in
a
moment
leaves
the
the
duenna
cyrano
pointing
to
the
two
and
who
may
be
these
two
songsters
cyrano
oh
they
are
part
of
a
bet
i
won
and
i
had
a
discussion
on
a
point
of
grammar
no
yes
no
yes
of
a
sudden
he
points
to
these
two
scarecrows
here
his
constant
escort
great
in
the
art
of
scratching
a
string
with
a
claw
and
he
says
i
bet
you
a
whole
day
of
music
he
lost
and
now
until
comes
i
must
enjoy
both
the
strains
and
the
presence
of
these
two
harmonious
witnesses
of
all
my
acts
pleasant
if
you
like
in
the
beginning
but
now
the
pleasure
is
growing
less
the
hep
just
go
and
play
a
pavan
with
my
compliments
for
that
actor
montfleury
go
up
to
the
i
come
this
evening
as
on
previous
evenings
the
pages
who
are
play
long
and
out
of
tune
to
ask
roxane
if
the
friend
of
her
soul
is
still
as
faultless
as
before
roxane
out
of
the
how
beautiful
how
clever
he
is
and
how
i
love
him
cyrano
indeed
and
is
christian
so
very
clever
roxane
yes
dear
friend
more
so
even
than
yourself
cyrano
so
be
it
then
roxane
to
my
mind
it
would
be
impossible
for
anyone
to
deliver
with
more
elegance
and
wit
than
he
does
these
pretty
trifles
that
are
nothing
if
you
will
and
still
are
everything
at
times
it
is
true
he
seems
quite
but
suddenly
he
recovers
and
says
the
most
charming
things
cyrano
you
surprise
me
roxane
you
men
are
really
astonishing
because
christian
is
handsome
he
be
stupid
cyrano
i
doubt
if
he
can
speak
of
hearts
and
love
roxane
he
does
not
speak
of
he
lectures
on
them
sir
cyrano
and
he
writes
roxane
still
better
just
listen
the
more
you
take
of
what
my
heart
the
more
i
left
what
think
you
of
that
cyrano
so
so
roxane
and
of
this
since
i
must
suffer
and
to
suffer
have
a
heart
if
you
would
keep
the
heart
that
mine
then
send
me
yours
cyrano
at
first
he
had
too
much
heart
now
he
has
not
enough
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
exactly
how
much
heart
would
satisfy
him
roxane
you
are
exasperating
true
jealousy
cyrano
what
roxane
an
author
jealousy
and
is
not
this
just
as
lovely
as
possible
listen
you
my
heart
i
swear
has
but
a
single
cry
and
if
in
written
lines
fond
kisses
could
be
sent
o
madam
you
would
read
this
letter
with
your
lips
cyrano
an
unconscious
smile
of
ha
ha
the
lines
are
hum
hum
and
really
pretty
weak
roxane
indeed
and
this
cyrano
why
do
you
remember
all
his
letters
roxane
every
one
of
them
cyrano
undoubtedly
this
is
quite
a
compliment
roxane
he
is
a
master
cyrano
oh
a
master
roxane
a
master
i
say
cyrano
so
be
it
a
master
the
duenna
from
the
monsieur
de
guiche
cyrano
pushing
him
toward
the
get
into
the
house
it
is
better
he
should
not
see
you
here
or
else
he
might
suspect
roxane
yes
discover
my
secret
he
loves
me
he
is
powerful
and
he
must
not
know
of
my
love
he
could
destroy
it
cyrano
the
very
well
then
very
well
roxane
guiche
the
duenna
a
roxane
guiche
with
a
i
was
just
going
out
guiche
and
i
have
come
to
take
leave
before
starting
for
the
front
roxane
oh
guiche
i
am
ordered
to
the
siege
of
arras
roxane
oh
guiche
and
i
go
roxane
oh
guiche
my
departure
does
not
seem
to
distress
you
greatly
roxane
oh
guiche
but
i
seriously
grieve
over
it
shall
i
ever
see
you
again
when
by
the
way
i
have
been
given
a
high
command
roxane
i
congratulate
you
guiche
the
guards
regiment
roxane
oh
the
guards
guiche
yes
the
regiment
in
which
is
your
cousin
the
man
of
boastful
words
i
have
my
revenge
when
i
get
him
at
the
siege
roxane
what
the
guards
are
going
there
guiche
of
course
since
they
are
now
my
regiment
roxane
on
the
bench
christian
guiche
what
ails
you
roxane
this
departure
grieves
me
sorely
to
know
that
those
you
care
for
are
going
to
battle
guiche
and
why
is
it
i
hear
words
so
sweet
only
on
the
day
of
my
departure
roxane
her
manner
and
using
her
so
then
you
mean
to
seek
revenge
on
my
cousin
cyrano
guiche
do
you
take
his
part
roxane
i
not
at
all
i
am
against
him
guiche
do
you
see
him
often
roxane
very
seldom
guiche
i
meet
him
everywhere
with
one
of
those
cadets
this
neu
vil
neuvil
roxane
a
tall
man
guiche
a
blond
roxane
rather
guiche
handsome
roxane
for
some
perhaps
but
guiche
but
very
stupid
roxane
so
it
struck
me
her
revenge
as
regards
cyrano
no
doubt
consists
in
holding
him
under
fire
which
he
relishes
so
i
hardly
see
great
vengeance
for
you
in
that
i
can
tell
you
though
what
would
wound
him
to
the
quick
guiche
and
that
is
roxane
to
have
his
regiment
and
his
dear
cadets
remain
so
long
as
there
is
war
right
here
in
paris
inactive
the
only
way
to
punish
him
is
to
deprive
him
of
danger
guiche
woman
woman
no
one
but
a
woman
would
think
of
such
a
scheme
closer
to
you
have
then
some
regard
for
me
the
fact
that
you
take
sides
with
me
roxane
is
in
my
eyes
a
proof
of
love
roxane
it
is
one
guiche
several
sealed
i
have
the
orders
here
for
every
company
and
they
shall
be
sent
immediately
except
takes
one
out
of
the
this
one
it
is
for
the
cadets
and
it
into
a
i
hold
it
back
ha
ha
cyrano
eager
for
the
fray
and
so
you
play
with
people
as
with
mice
roxane
roxane
sometimes
guiche
close
to
you
enthrall
me
roxane

by
here

the
convent
of
the
capuchin
fathers
laymen
can
not
enter
it
but
as
the
fathers
serve
my
uncle
richelieu
they
have
some
regard
for
his
nephew
and
they
will
give
me
a
place
of
concealment
officially
i
shall
have
left
for
the
front
but
i
shall
return
to
you
under
the
cover
of
a
mask

me
to
delay
my
departure

few
hours

if
you
are
discovered

by

gods

love
more
roxane
as
she
was
going
to
close
the
why
you
are
improving
christian
love
grows
stronger
in
the
restless
soul
mine
that
he
has
chosen
child
a
cradle
roxane
out
on
the
better
still
since
this
love
is
so
cruel
you
were
foolish
indeed
not
to
smother
it
at
its
birth
christian
i
tried
without
success
this
babe
madam
is
a
little
hercules
roxane
still
better
christian
in
fact
he
without
an
effort
serpents
and
roxane
on
the
balcony
very
good
indeed
but
why
do
you
speak
so
has
your
imagination
the
gout
that
it
limps
so
cyrano
christian
under
the
balcony
and
noiselessly
taking
christian
place
before
hush
the
task
is
getting
too
difficult
roxane
you
waver
in
your
speech
why
so
cyrano
in
a
low
tone
as
christian
did
before
because
night
has
come
and
in
the
dark
my
words
must
wander
in
search
of
your
ear
roxane
but
my
words
meet
with
no
such
difficulty
cyrano
yours
find
a
immediately
oh
very
naturally
since
i
receive
them
into
my
heart
remember
that
my
heart
is
large
while
your
ear
is
very
small
moreover
your
words
descend
thus
have
they
speed
while
mine
must
rise
madam
they
require
more
time
roxane
but
they
have
been
rising
much
better
for
the
last
few
moments
cyrano
they
are
getting
trained
to
climbing
roxane
the
fact
is
that
i
am
speaking
to
you
from
quite
a
height
cyrano
assuredly
and
you
would
kill
me
if
from
such
an
elevation
you
allowed
a
sharp
word
to
drop
upon
my
heart
roxane
i
come
down
cyrano
no
roxane
to
the
stone
bench
under
the
step
upon
the
bench
then
and
climb
up
here
cyrano
and
no
roxane
you
surprise
me
why
not
cyrano
and
more
let
us
rather
improve
this
opportunity
of
speaking
softly
together
without
seeing
each
other
roxane
what
to
each
other
almost
invisible
cyrano
as
let
us
enjoy
the
bliss
there
is
in
seeking
to
distinguish
one
the
other
for
you
i
but
the
darkness
of
a
cloak
for
me
you
are
the
whiteness
of
a
robe
i
shadow
only
you
are
blessèd
light
if
ever
you
have
thought
me
eloquent
roxane
i
have
cyrano
remember
now
that
my
words
never
yet
came
from
my
true
heart
roxane
why
not
cyrano
because
until
now
i
have
spoken
to
you
through
roxane
through
what
cyrano
the
spell
that
you
cast
upon
those
who
bask
in
the
light
of
your
eyes
and
so
this
night
to
me
it
seems
as
if
i
were
about
to
speak
to
you
for
the
first
time
roxane
ah
that
is
why
your
voice
seems
different
cyrano
and
coming
up
closer
to
the
yes
different
for
now
that
darkness
shields
me
i
dare
to
be
myself
at
last
i
dare
stops
where
was
i
i
forget
pardon
my
confusion
all
this
is
so
exquisite
so
new
to
me
roxane
so
new
cyrano
bewildered
and
trying
to
so
new
why
yes
it
new
to
be
sincere
and
then
a
fear
of
ridicule
roxane
ridicule
for
what
cyrano
my
emotional
flights
my
heart
through
diffidence
forever
calls
upon
my
mind
to
shield
it
from
disdain
i
start
to
cull
a
star
and
then
i
halt
for
fear
of
ridicule
to
pick
a
floret
roxane
a
floret
has
its
charms
cyrano
disdain
them
now
roxane
you
never
spoke
to
me
as
now
you
speak
cyrano
oh
let
us
set
aside
the
pygmy
things
the
superannuated
niceties
of
love
as
it
is
understood
why
sip
by
drops
the
waters
of
a
spring
when
from
a
river
we
can
freely
quaff
roxane
but
mind
and
wit
cyrano
they
serve
to
make
you
stay
but
now
be
an
insult
to
the
night
to
fragrance
and
to
fate
and
nature
too
if
we
should
hold
unto
affected
style
one
look
above
and
artifice
disarms
i
fear
that
with
this
subtle
alchemy
the
truth
of
sentiment
might
vapourise
the
soul
exhaust
itself
in
futile
play
and
niceties
be
carried
to
a
point
so
pointed
that
it
end
in
nothingness
roxane
but
mind
and
wit
cyrano
i
hate
them
now
it
is
a
crime
to
force
sweet
love
to
bandy
words
there
comes
a
time
moreover
be
assured
oh
how
i
pity
those
who
feel
it
not
when
our
breast
with
noble
love
a
love
that
pretty
words
must
desecrate
roxane
since
now
for
both
of
us
the
time
has
come
what
words
shall
i
expect
from
you
cyrano
all
all
all
those
i
know
accept
them
scattered
loose
unsought
unbound
i
love
you
let
me
breathe
i
love
thee
and
i
rave
is
joy
too
much
thy
name
is
in
my
heart
as
in
a
bell
roxane
and
as
my
heart
forever
throbs
the
bell
is
the
sounder
of
thy
name
of
thee
there
nought
i
do
not
hoard
and
love
i
mind
me
that
last
year
the
twelfth
of
may
a
twist
was
changed
in
what
a
crown
thy
hair
thy
glowing
hair
to
me
is
truly
light
when
we
have
gazed
too
long
upon
the
sun
we
see
on
things
around
a
halo
reign
is
thus
when
i
have
lost
the
light
thou
shedst
my
dazzled
eyes
are
filled
with
golden
sparks
roxane
yes
this
is
love
cyrano
the
passion
in
my
heart
is
jealous
fierce
with
sadness
tainted
but
it
really
love
love
shorn
of
selfish
thought
would
i
could
give
my
happiness
for
thine
shouldst
thou
suspect
whose
gift
it
was
if
i
could
hear
perchance
and
from
afar
the
music
of
thy
bliss
my
offering
from
every
glance
of
thine
fresh
virtue
springs
fresh
valour
too
oh
say
i
understood
and
that
thou
feelst
my
soul
ascend
to
thee
all
is
too
beautiful
and
sweet
and
still
it
true
i
speak
at
last
to
thee
yes
i
to
thee
is
bliss
too
great
my
hopes
my
wildest
hopes
leaped
to
such
a
height
my
dream
no
dream
and
i
can
die
content
because
of
me
she
quivers
with
the
trees
for
leaf
divine
you
tremble
with
the
leaves
thou
tremblest
for
against
thy
will
or
not
i
feel
oh
bliss
the
tremour
of
thy
hand
descending
now
along
these
flowery
vines
imprints
a
passionate
kiss
upon
one
of
the
roxane
i
tremble
yes
i
weep
i
love
i
thine
i
am
enthralled
cyrano
may
death
then
come
along
since
rapture
born
of
me
of
me
alone
what
more
can
i
expect
of
life
christian
the
a
kiss
roxane
what
cyrano
oh
roxane
you
claim
cyrano
yes
i
to
you
go
too
far

is
moved
it
time
for
me
to
act
cyrano

i
i
asked
it
is
true
but
now
i
realise
how
more
than
bold
i
was
roxane
and
you
do
not
insist
cyrano
insist
of
course
i
do
but
with
reserve
yes
i
know
your
modesty
offended
so
i
withdraw
the
kiss

it
to
me
christian
a
tug
at
cyrano
why
so
cyrano
be
silent
christian
roxane
over
the
what
are
you
muttering
cyrano
i
was
reproving
myself
for
going
too
far

was
saying

one
moment

one

closes
her
window

listens
to
the
archlutes
one
of
them
plays
a
lively
air
and
the
other
a
sad
lively
sad
a
woman
or
a
man

holding
a
lighted
lantern

goes
from
house
to
house
looking
at
the
in
this
tirade
and
in
the
following
one
and
are
intentionally
interwoven
when
cyrano
is
carried
by
his
emotion
he
passes
from
to
which
latter
is
in
french
familiar
and
endearing
much
more
than
in
english
then
reclaimed
by
reason
and
fearing
that
he
has
overstepped
the
bounds
he
returns
to
the
in
french
more
formal
or
resorts
to
a
discreet
only
to
forget
himself
again
and
to
resume
the
caressing
cyrano
christian
capuchin
monk
cyrano
the

to
tears
glide
on
from
tear
to
kiss
there
but
a
thrill
roxane

after
all
what

an
oath

sealing
of
confessions

love
a
secret

moment
of
infinity

buzzes
like
a
bee
communion
with
the
fragrance

a
gentle
way
for

to
breathe
a
heart
for

from
fervid
lips
to
drink
a
soul
roxane

him
down

height
remaining
crushed

dazed

great
bear
and
as
nearing
the
trident
i
managed
to
avoid
its
three
lances
i
fell
in
a
lump
upon
the
balance
where
my
weight
up
there
is
still
registered
guiche
from
passing
and
holding
him
by
one
of
his
if
you
were
to
press
my
nose
sir
you
would
cause
a
flow
of
milk
guiche
milk
indeed
cyrano
yes
sir
from
the
milky
way
guiche
oh
by
satan
cyrano
no
i
dropped
from
heaven
his
would
you
believe
it
i
noticed
it
as
i
was
going
by
there
sirius
at
night
actually
wears
a
turban
the
other
bear
the
little
one
is
still
too
small
to
bite
as
i
was
passing
through
the
lyre
i
broke
one
of
its
strings
but
i
intend
to
write
a
book
on
the
subject
and
the
golden
stars
that
i
gathered
into
my
scorched
cloak
regardless
of
peril
shall
be
used
by
my
printer
for
asterisks
guiche
once
more
i
must
insist
cyrano
oh
sir
i
know
what
you
desire
guiche
you
do
cyrano
yes
you
desire
to
hear
from
me
how
the
moon
is
made
and
if
any
one
inhabits
the
rotundity
of
this
cucurbit
guiche
no
no
i
desire
cyrano
to
learn
how
i
got
up
there
easily
through
an
invention
of
mine
guiche
a
madman
certainly
cyrano
i
copied
not
the
stupid
eagle
of
regiomontanus
or
the
timid
pigeon
of
archytas
guiche
a
madman
but
a
learned
one
cyrano
no
sir
i
imitated
nothing
ever
done
having
managed
to
pass
is
nearing
roxane
door
but
cyrano
follows
ready
to
seize
i
invented
six
different
ways
of
assaulting
the
virgin
blue
guiche
six
cyrano
increased
i
could
with
body
as
bare
as
a
taper
have
comparisoned
it
with
crystal
phials
with
tears
from
the
morning
skies
and
my
person
then
if
exposed
in
the
sun
would
have
been
aspirated
by
the
luminary
along
with
the
dew
guiche
goes
toward
true
that
is
one
way
cyrano
so
as
to
draw
him
further
again
i
could
have
created
a
powerful
gust
of
wind
to
lift
me
if
i
had
rarefied
the
air
in
a
cedar
box
by
means
of
heated
mirrors
forming
an
icosahedron
guiche
two
ways
cyrano
or
else
being
both
a
machinist
and
an
artificer
have
straddled
a
grasshopper
and
caused
myself
through
successive
explosions
of
saltpetre
to
be
projected
into
the
azure
fields
where
the
stars
are
wont
to
graze
guiche
following
him
and
counting
on
his
that
is
three
cyrano
since
smoke
persists
in
rising
i
might
have
blown
into
a
globe
enough
of
it
to
carry
me
up
guiche
and
more
four
cyrano
since
phoebe
when
her
bow
is
the
thinnest
loves
to
draw
o
beeves
your
marrow
anoint
myself
with
the
same
guiche
five
cyrano
has
managed
while
talking
to
press
guiche
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
square
near
a
last
i
could
have
placed
myself
upon
an
iron
plate
taken
a
magnet
and
thrown
it
up
into
the
air
this
is
a
capital
way
as
soon
as
the
magnet
starts
the
iron
rushes
in
pursuit
of
it
the
magnet
is
thrown
up
again
the
iron
plate
follows
and
cadedis
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
ascension
from
lasting
indefinitely
guiche
six
all
excellent
systems
and
tell
me
sir
which
one
of
the
six
did
you
adopt
cyrano
a
seventh
one
guiche
astonishing
and
what
was
it
please
cyrano
you
would
never
dream
of
it
guiche
the
fellow
is
really
interesting
cyrano
mysterious
and
imitating
the
sound
of
waves
on
a
houüh
houüh
guiche
what
that
cyrano
you
can
not
imagine
guiche
no
cyrano
the
tide
as
it
was
running
out
in
obedience
to
the
attraction
of
the
moon
i
lay
on
the
sands
head
foremost
so
that
my
hair
hair
you
know
does
not
dry
fast
so
that
my
hair
was
kept
bathed
in
the
receding
waves
and
thus
i
was
by
the
moon
attraction
drawn
up
up
erect
like
an
angel
and
up
i
went
gently
without
an
effort
until
suddenly
i
felt
a
shock
then
guiche
takes
a
seat
on
the
then
cyrano
then
his
natural
the
fifteen
minutes
have
elapsed
sir
and
now
i
grant
you
your
freedom
the
marriage
is
accomplished

out

cucurbite
for

is
in

as
odd
as
it
appears
in

the
oddity
of
the
expression
that
assimulates

terrible
siege

we
use
it
as
a

for
the

another

there
is
a
humming
in
my
ears
cyrano
not
that
an
empty

impossible
other

oh
for
something
to
eat
with

oil
cyrano
off
the
helmet
of
the
cadet
in
whose
hand
he
places

the
iliad
other

meanwhile
the
minister
in
paris
has
his
four
meals

to
send

least
a
partridge
same

why
not
and
some
wine
with
it
too
cyrano
richelieu
some

if

by

cyrano
the

is
so
intoxicating
other

i
as
hungry
as
a
bear
cyrano
well
bear
it
first
cadet
his
forever
words
a
point
cyrano
a
point
and
words
is
true
and
i
should
like
to
die
at
eve
the
sky
aglow
as
the
defender
of
a
noble
cause
a
soldier
and
a
poet
too
with
on
my
lips
the
thrill
of
daring
words
and
in
my
heart
a
sword
ennobling
point
all
we
hungry
cyrano
his
so
you
think
of
naught
but
food
come
up
here
then
bertrandou
with
your
fife
seek
shepherds
notes
and
let
these
gluttons
feast
upon
some
old
and
forgotten
tune
each
sound
of
which
is
like
a
sister
voice
an
air
that
slowly
winds
its
way
aloft
as
does
the
smoke
from
lowly
cottage
roofs
a
lay
of
youth
of
waiting
hearts
and
home
prepares
his
let
fife
a
while
forget
the
battle
note
remembering
that
it
was
born
a
reed
begins
playing
some
gascony
ye
gascons
list
is
war
no
more
but
peace
is
hill
and
dale
is
wood
and
with
lads
beside
their
gentle
herds
is
smiling
riverbank
and
sunny
sea
o
gascons
hark
you
are
in
gascony
have
bowed
their
heads
and
are
dreaming
many
brush
away
a
carbon
cyrano
but
instead
of
giving
them
courage
you
make
them
weep
cyrano
i
made
them
homesick
a
noble
sort
of
suffering
nobler
than
hunger
it
is
a
comfort
to
see
their
pain
change
organs
and
pass
from
their
stomachs
to
their
hearts
carbon
but
you
will
weaken
them
cyrano
to
a
drummer
to
come
never
mind
the
heroes
blood
that
is
in
them
will
soon
arouse
them
motions
to
the
drummer
who
begins
beating
his
all
the
cadets
to
their
hey
what
what
is
it
cyrano
to
you
see
that
at
the
sound
of
the
drum
dreams
longings
thoughts
of
home
of
love
fly
away
what
comes
by
the
fife
goes
by
the
drum
a
cadet
the
ha
ha
here
is
monsieur
de
guiche
all
the
cadets
hou
cyrano
quite
complimentary
a
cadet
he
is
a
bore
with
his
lace
collar
over
his
armour
he
comes
here
to
exhibit
himself
other
cadet
as
if
lace
were
in
keeping
with
iron
other
cadet
good
if
one
has
a
boil
on
his
neck
other
cadet
too
much
of
the
courtier
other
cadet
the
nephew
of
his
uncle
the
cardinal
carbon
and
still
he
a
gascon
first
cadet
not
a
true
one
because
gascons
you
know
must
be
madcaps
there
is
nothing
more
dangerous
than
a
reasonable
gascon
le
bret
how
pale
he
is
a
cadet
he
is
hungry
just
as
much
as
we
poor
devils
but
his
breastplate
gives
a
lustre
to
his
cramps
cyrano
we
should
not
appear
to
suffer
more
than
he
does
here
all
of
you
take
up
your
cards
your
pipes
and
your
dice
all
rapidly
begin
playing
on
benches
drums
or
on
their
cloaks
spread
out
on
the
ground
meanwhile
lighting
long
and
i
will
read
descartes
walks
up
and
down
reading
a
small
book
that
he
has
taken
out
of
his
guiche
enters
everybody
seems
busy
and
satisfied
he
is
very
pale
goes
up
to
tu
croques
le
marmot
literally
you
are
eating
the
baby
is
an
allusion
to
ogres
proverbial
taste
for
infants
coupled
with
the
somewhat
slangy
meaning
you
are
waiting
long
and
impatiently
this
in
english
would
be
meaningless
and
was
perforce
replaced
by
what
seems
to
be
a
fair
equivalent
a
french
proverb
guiche
guiche
ha
good
morning
after
looking
at
carbon
with
his
face
is
green
carbon
there
is
nothing
left
of
him
but
his
eyes
guiche
at
the
so
here
are
these
soreheads
yes
gentlemen
i
understand
that
i
am
jeered
at
plentifully
here
that
cadets
nobility
and
gentry
barons
all
are
not
with
respect
for
their
colonel
that
they
charge
me
with
intrigue
and
that
my
lace
collar
over
my
breastplate
is
an
to
them
and
that
it
is
distressing
to
them
to
find
that
one
can
be
a
gascon
and
still
not
out
at
the
elbow
the
cadets
continue
to
play
and
shall
i
have
you
punished
by
your
captain
no
carbon
well
i
am
free
and
i
punish
only
guiche
ah
carbon
i
paid
for
my
company
and
it
belongs
to
me
i
obey
only
to
war
commands
guiche
ah
well
that
is
sufficient
to
the
i
can
afford
to
scorn
your
bluster
everybody
knows
how
i
behave
under
fire
even
yesterday
there
were
enough
witnesses
to
the
spirit
with
which
i
routed
count
de
bucquoi
leading
my
people
against
his
men
like
an
avalanche
i
charged
him
three
successive
times
cyrano
lifting
his
eyes
from
his
how
about
your
white
scarf
guiche
and
you
know
of
this
trifle
true
it
happened
while
i
was
circling
to
gather
my
people
for
the
third
charge
that
a
party
of
runaways
forced
me
too
close
to
the
enemy
i
was
in
danger
of
being
taken
or
shot
when
happily
i
bethought
me
to
untie
and
to
drop
the
scarf
that
told
my
rank
in
this
way
and
without
attracting
notice
i
managed
to
get
away
from
the
spaniards
and
to
turn
back
upon
them
with
all
my
men
beating
them
terribly
now
what
do
you
say
to
this
cadets
affect
not
to
listen
but
they
have
stopped
playing
and
they
hold
back
the
smoke
of
their
pipes
a
cyrano
i
say
that
henry
iv
even
surrounded
by
a
host
of
foes
never
would
have
consented
to
diminish
himself
by
casting
off
his
plume
of
snowy
white
joy
playing
and
smoking
are
guiche
the
device
was
successful
however
and
smoking
again
cyrano
possibly
but
who
would
abdicate
the
honour
of
being
a
target
and
smoking
resumed
growing
had
i
been
present
when
the
scarf
slipped
off
see
how
ideas
of
bravery
can
vary
sir
i
should
have
picked
it
up
and
put
it
on
guiche
yes
gascon
boasting
again
cyrano
boasting
lend
it
to
me
i
offer
to
hang
it
on
my
shoulder
and
this
very
night
to
scale
with
it
the
enemy
fortifications
guiche
a
gascon
offer
you
know
full
well
that
the
scarf
remained
on
the
enemy
ground
near
the
river
scarpe
a
place
so
well
covered
by
spanish
guns
that
nobody
can
venture
there
to
get
it
cyrano
a
white
scarf
from
his
pocket
and
handing
it
to
here
it
is
the
cadets
restrain
their
laughter
and
affect
to
be
very
busy
playing
guiche
turns
and
looks
at
them
they
assume
an
air
of
great
gravity
one
of
them
in
an
way
half
whistles
one
of
the
airs
the
fife
played
a
while
guiche
the
thank
you
i
can
use
this
white
fabric
to
make

spanish
spy

is
very
useful
to
us
takes
over
to
the
enemy
information
that
i
give
him
so
that
we
can
influence
their
decision
cyrano
he
is
a
blackguard

a
great
convenience

desperate
attempt

revictual
us
the
marshal
left

dourlens
he
took
with
him
so
many
men
that
an
attack
upon

be
successful

spanish

i
drove
on
so
long

right
through
the
spanish
army
first
cadet
oh

they
are
knowing
ones
guiche
but
how
could
you
get
through
their
lines
le
bret
it
must
have
been
very
difficult
roxane
why
no
i
just
went
along
in
my
coach
on
a
trot
whenever
one
of
the
dons
showed
his
haughty
face
i
put
on
and
displayed
through
the
window
my
most
fascinating
smile
and
these
gentlemen
being
whatever
the
french
may
say
the
most
courteous
people
in
the
world
i
passed
carbon
yes
you
have
a
most
excellent
passport
in
that
smile
but
you
must
frequently
have
been
called
upon
madam
to
declare
whither
you
were
going
roxane
oh
yes
quite
frequently
i
answered
simply
i
am
going
to
see
my
lover
immediately
the
most
ferocious
spaniard
would
gravely
close
the
door
of
my
coach
with
a
knightly
wave
of
the
hand
order
up
the
muskets
already
pointed
at
me
and
with
as
much
grace
as
haughtiness
the
plume
of
his
hat
proudly
floating
on
the
breeze
bow
low
and
say
pass
on
senorita
christian
but
roxane
roxane
i
said
my
lover
yes
husband
you
must
forgive
you
will
surely
understand
that
if
i
had
said
my
husband
nobody
would
have
let
me
pass
christian
but
roxane
well
what
guiche
you
must
be
gone
immediately
roxane
i
cyrano
yes
and
sooner
christian
yes
at
once
roxane
but
how
can
i
get
away
christian
the
fact
is
cyrano
in
minutes
guiche
or
fifty
carbon
it
would
be
preferable
le
bret
you
might
roxane
i
remain
for
there

going
to
be
fighting
all
fighting
nothing
of
the
kind
roxane
herself
into
the
arms
of
he
is
my
husband
and
if
he
is
killed
i
must
be
killed
too
christian
but
what
is
the
matter
with
your
eyes
roxane
i
will
tell
you
later
guiche
but
the
post
is
a
most
dangerous
one
roxane
what
so
dangerous
cyrano

and
the
proof
is
that
he
assigned
it
to
us
roxane

a
widow
of
me
guiche
i
swear
to
you
roxane

just
so
i
put
some
on

hat
which

be
very
becoming
in
the
fray

time

it
only
on

her
you
have
christian
i
have
what
cyrano
you
have
to
her
more
often
than
you
think
christian
how
so
cyrano
well
i
had
undertaken
to
speak
for
you
and
i
interpreted
your
love
sometimes
i
wrote
without
saying
to
you
i
writing
christian
oh
you
did
cyrano
yes
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
as
i
said
christian

have
been
hemmed
in
how
did
you
manage
to
cyrano
oh
before
dawn
i
could
pass
through
the
lines
christian
his
ah
another
very
simple
matter
i
suppose
and
how
many
times
a
week
did
i
write
twice
three
times
four
times
cyrano
more
christian
every
day
cyrano
yes
every
day
twice
christian
and
this
enraptured
you
and
the
rapture
was
such
that
each
day
you
faced
death
cyrano
roxane
who
is
hush
not
in
her
presence
rapidly
under
his
roxane
christian
the
cadets

carbon
guiche

dear
christian
christian

her
and

me
why
over
impassable

through
the
ranks
of
brutal
soldiery
you
joined
me
here
roxane
on
account
of
your
letters
christian
my
letters
roxane
yes
and
it
is
your
fault
if
i
took
so
many
risks
your
letters
intoxicated
me
ah

how
many
you
wrote
me
during
this
last
month
and
all
so
beautiful
christian
what
do
you
mean
to
say
that
for
a
few
short
love
letters
roxane
your
letters
yes
my
ardent
love
for
you
love
passionate
was
born
that
night
of
bliss
when
from
beneath
my
willing
balcony
in
accents
that
to
both
of
us
were
new
a
soul
revealed
itself
to
me
yours
so
that
each
time
your
letters
came
it
seemed
as
if
i
lived
those
minutes
once
again
and
i
heard
your
voice
itself
those
tender
tones
that
twined
around
me
then
so
here
am
i
penelope
would
not
have
persevered
in
waiting
labour
if
ulysses
could
have
written
grandly
so
but
daft
as
helen
she
to
join
him
would
have
flung
away
her
tedious
worsted
balls
christian
but
roxane
yes
i
read
and
read
while
every
thrill
confirmed
me
yours
each
leaflet
that
i
held
was
like
a
petal
wafted
from
your
soul
each
word
was
one
of
love
sincere
and
strong
christian
indeed
sincere
and
strong
you
felt
it
so
roxane
oh
yes
so
strongly
christian

came
because

conqueror

should
clasp
your
knees
so
is
my
soul
that
at
your
feet
my
soul
you
never
can
remove
from
reverence
i
came
to
seek
forgiveness
and
the
time
is
meet

is
near
perhaps
your
pardon
for
how
frivolous
i
was
once
loving
you
for
beauty

later

growing
sense
a
bird

marked
your
soul
outshining
your
looks
and
then
i
loved
you
more
for
both
christian
and
now
roxane

have
in
short
yourself
outshone
yourself
and

love
you
for
your
soul
alone
christian

margaret
i
have
to
tell

do
not
he
would
tease
us
sister
martha
say
that
we
are
vain
sister
claire
or
great
gluttons
mother
margaret
but
full
of
goodness
sister
claire
is
it
not
true
mother
that
he
has
been
coming
here
every
saturday
for
the
last
ten
years
mother
margaret
and
more
ever
since
his
cousin
fourteen
years
ago
saddened
the
whiteness
of
our
caps
with
the
darkness
of
her
widow
veil
as
would
a
bird
of
sombre
hue
alighting
a
flight
of
brighter
birds
sister
martha
and
he
alone
can
relieve
with
a
ray
of
light
the
grief
that
she
persists
in
feeding
the
other
sisters
he
is
so
entertaining
it
is
fun
when
he
comes
he
teases
us
he
is
so
kind
we
love
him
so
and
we
make
sweets
for
him
sister
martha
but
he
is
not
a
very
good
catholic
sister
claire
we
convert
him
the
other
sisters
assuredly
we
will
mother
margaret
i
forbid
your
tormenting
him
on
that
score
children
he
might
come
here
less
often
sister
martha
but
dear
mother
god
mother
margaret
have
no
fear
god
knows
him
sister
martha
but
every
saturday
as
he
enters
he
says
proudly
sister
like
a
bad
catholic
i
ate
meat
yesterday
mother
margaret
is
that
what
he
says
well
the
last
time
he
came
he
had
eaten
nothing
whatever
for
two
days
sister
martha
mother
mother
margaret
he
is
very
poor
mr
le
bret
told
me
so
sister
martha
and
no
one
assists
him
mother
margaret
he
is
proud
and
would
not
accept
assistance
is
seen
in
the
rear
she
is
in
black
wearing
the
long
veil
of
a
widow
guiche
grown
older
but
magnificently
clad
accompanies
her
they
walk
slowly
mother
margaret
come
it
is
time
to
get
here
is
madam
madeleine
with
a
visitor
sister
martha
to
sister
it
is
the
marshall
duke
de
grammont
sister
claire
yes
i
think
it
is
sister
martha
he
has
not
come
to
see
her
for
months
sister
claire
the
court
the
army
the
world
keep
him
away
i
suppose
sisters
guiche
and
roxane
come
down
in
silence
and
stop
near
the
tapestry
frame
a
roxane
duke
de
grammont
count
de
le
bret
ragueneau
duke
and
so
you
persist
in
remaining
in
this
seclusion
uselessly
lovely
forever
in
mourning
roxane
forever
duke
ever
true
to
his
memory
roxane
ever
duke
you
have
forgiven
me
roxane
yes
since
i
am
here
duke
and
he
was
truly
so
roxane
you
never
really
knew
him
duke
probably
and
his
last
letter
lies
on
your
heart
always
roxane
like
a
blessèd
talisman
it
hangs
on
this
ribbon
duke
you
love
him
even
dead
roxane
at
times
it
seems
as
if
he
left
me
not
as
if
our
hearts
still
beat
as
one
as
if
his
love
still
coiled
around
me
strong
alive
duke
does
cyrano
ever
come
to
see
you
roxane
yes
often
he
is
a
very
dear
old
friend
and
he
brings
me
all
the
news
he
comes
regularly
every
saturday
as
the
hour
strikes
while
i
am
at
work
on
my
tapestry
i
know
without
even
turning
around
to
see
that
he
is
here
for
i
can
hear
his
stick
on
the
stone
steps
if
the
weather
is
fine
he
sits
under
this
tree
where
his
chair
awaits
him
he
laughs
at
what
he
calls
my
eternal
work
relates
to
me
the
events
of
the
week
and
bret
appears
on
the
why
here
is
le
bret
le
bret
who
has
come
and
how
is
our
friend
le
bret
not
at
all
well
duke
oh
i
sorry
roxane
le
bret
exaggerates
le
bret
all
as
i
predicted
desertion
and
poverty
his
epistles
have
made
him
new
enemies
he
denounces
mock
nobility
mock
piety
mock
bravery
plagiarism
in
fact
everybody
roxane
but
the
fear
of
his
wonderful
sword
holds
them
all
in
respect
never
reach
him
duke
his
who
knows
le
bret
what
i
fear
for
him
is
not
an
assault
it
is
solitude
hunger
winter
stealthily
entering
his
poor
abode
these
are
the
enemies
that
may
lay
him
each
morning
he
buckles
his
belt
a
little
tighter
his
nose
has
now
the
sallowness
of
old
ivory
his
wardrobe
is
reduced
to
one
suit
of
black
duke
ah
he
at
least
is
not
a
parvenu
so
do
not
pity
him
too
much
he
has
lived
free
from
obligations
and
humiliating
restraint
le
bret
duke
duke
duke
yes
i
know
i
have
everything
and
he
has
nothing
but
i
should
very
much
like
to
shake
his
hand
to
farewell
roxane
i
see
you
to
the
gate
duke
bows
to
le
bret
and
goes
with
roxane
towards
the
duke
a
i
envy
him
at
times
you
see
roxane
when
we
have
had
too
much
success
in
life
although
we
done
no
very
wicked
act
we
feel
within
a
thousand
sickly
stings
of
their
total
is
too
small
to
constitute
remorse
but
large
enough
to
keep
us
in
a
dull
uneasiness
thus
ducal
mantles
sweep
as
we
ascend
the
steps
of
greatness
with
their
fringe
of
furs
a
rustling
heap
of
withered
sentiments
as
now
your
sombre
train
upon
the
porch
draws
in
its
folds
a
bunch
of
autumn
leaves
roxane
you
are
in
a
very
sentimental
mood
the
duke
alas
yes
he
is
about
to
go
out
monsieur

bret
by
your
permission
one
word
le
bret
in
a
low
it
is
true
no
one
would
dare
to
attack
your
friend
but
there
are
many
who
hate
him
and
somebody
said
to
me
yesterday
at
the
reception
this
cyrano
is
not
unlikely
to
meet
some
day
with
an
accident
tell
him
not
to
be
about
too
much
to
be
prudent
le
bret
up
his
prudent

but
he
is
coming
here
and
i
must
warn
him
though

do
much
good

how
well
their
race
is
short
and
still
they
sweetly
show

beauty
recoils
from
rottenness

as
they
drop
they
do
not

their
grace
appear
to

rather
to

long
silence
it
is
quite
dark
she
joins
her
hands
and
speaks
slowly
and
during
fourteen
years
you

played
this
part
of
an
old
friend
who
comes
to
amuse
cyrano
roxane
roxane
it
was
you
cyrano

to
you

roxane
how

thus
since
on
these
lines
not
his
by
word
or
thought
the
tears
were
yours
cyrano
because
the
blood
is
his
roxane
why
then
allow
a
silence
that
sublime
to
break
as
now
cyrano
roxane
oh
why
indeed
bret
and
ragueneau
enter
on
a
intentional
affectation
like
that
of
his
indisposition
was
sentenced
for
high
treason
le
bret
ragueneau
le
bret
how
imprudent
i
was
sure
of
it
he
is
here
cyrano
and
straightening

i
here
le

it
is
suicide
madam
for
him
to
have
left
his

but
just
now
then
weakness

fainting
cyrano
oh

is
seen
wrapped
in
roxane
what
did
he
say
cyrano
his
poor
head
what
have
they
done
to
you
cyrano
and
in
my
heart
a
sword
ennobling
point
so

i
once
what
mockery
in
fate
and
now
i
killed
ignobly
from
behind
by
a
lackey
with
a
log
i
missed
my
life

balcony

words
were
mine
and
mine
the
fondest
thoughts
but
i
remained
below

in
darkness
while
another
went
aloft
to
gather
light
and
love
is
justice
and
my
dying
breath

good
socrates

and
lofty
to

thus
to
die
cyrano
there
is
le
bret
growling
again
le

into
my
dearest
friend
cyrano
with
wildness
in

the
elementary
mass
why
yes
there

alas
delirious
cyrano
copernicus
said

was
he
doing
what
the
deuce
was
he
doing
in
that
galley
philosopher
and
physicist
a
rimester
swordsman
and
musician
a
man
who
travelled
in
the
air
as
prompt
with
parry
as
reply
a
lover
too
alas
here
lies
sir
hercules
savinian
de
cyrano
de
bergerac
who
compassed
all
and
still
was
naught
but
i
must
leave
i
would
not
cause
a
wait
your
pardon
see
the
moon
sends
down
for
me
ray
of
light
from
the
moon
is
on
him
he
falls
back
into
his
chair
the
weeping
of
roxane
wakes
him
from
his
dreamy
state
he
looks
at
her
and
strokes
her
i
would
not
have
you
weep
a
wit
the
less
for
christian
who
was
all
that
good
and
grand
but
when
the
hand
of
ice
has
laid
me
low
i
would
your
weeds
might
have
a
double
sense
of
mourning
first
for
him
then
for
me
roxane
i
swear
to
you
cyrano
with

rises

comes
i
have
already
marble

i
meet

his

fall

ha

i

it
looks
it

to
look
the

at
my

his
what
say
you
it
useless
i
know
but
valiant
hearts
contend
not
for
success
it
nobler
to
defend
a
hopeless
cause
who
are
you
all
i
count
a
thousand
i
know
you
now
my
enemies
of
old
you
falsehood
the

submit
no

ah

imbecility
i
know
that
in

i
must
succumb

in

of

there
is
a
something
that
i
bear
along
with
me
to
sweep
with
grandeur
as
i
pass

and
the

however
the

death
feminine
in

the
personifying
somewhat
customary
in
english
poetry
was
set
aside
and
the
gender
was
intentionally
preserved
because
being
more
vague
it
better
represents
the
and
is
more
expressive
of
cyrano
daring
and
repulsion
for
a
loathsome
cyrano
who
put
to
flight
one
hundred
men
could
not
be
expected
to
fear
a
person
much
less
a
