on
the
of
december
last
gerbois
professor
of
mathematics
at
versailles
college
rummaging
among
the
stores
at
a
dealer
discovered
a
small
mahogany
which
took
his
fancy
because
of
its
many
drawers
that
just
what
i
want
for
suzanne
birthday
he
thought
gerbois
means
were
limited
and
anxious
as
he
was
to
please
his
daughter
he
felt
it
his
duty
to
beat
the
dealer
down
he
ended
by
paying
francs
as
he
was
writing
down
his
address
a
and
young
man
who
had
been
hunting
through
the
shop
in
every
direction
caught
sight
of
the
and
asked
how
much
for
this
it
sold
replied
the
dealer
oh
to
this
gentleman
gerbois
bowed
and
feeling
all
the
happier
that
one
of
his
envied
him
his
purchase
left
the
shop
but
he
had
not
taken
ten
steps
in
the
street
before
the
young
man
caught
him
up
and
raising
his
hat
said
very
politely
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
sir
i
am
going
to
ask
you
an
indiscreet
question
were
you
looking
for
this
desk
rather
than
anything
else
no
i
went
to
the
shop
to
see
if
i
could
find
a
cheap
set
of
scales
for
my
experiments
therefore
you
do
not
want
it
very
particularly
i
want
it
that
all
because
it
old
i
suppose
because
it
useful
in
that
case
would
you
mind
exchanging
it
for
another
desk
quite
as
useful
but
in
better
condition
this
one
is
in
good
condition
and
i
see
no
point
in
exchanging
it
still
gerbois
was
a
man
easily
irritated
and
quick
to
take
offense
he
replied
curtly
i
must
ask
you
to
drop
the
subject
sir
the
young
man
placed
himself
in
front
of
him
i
do
know
how
much
you
paid
sir
but
i
offer
you
double
the
price
no
thank
you
three
times
the
price
oh
that
will
do
exclaimed
the
professor
impatiently
the
desk
belongs
to
me
and
is
not
for
sale
the
young
man
stared
at
him
with
a
look
that
remained
imprinted
on
gerbois
memory
then
turned
on
his
heel
without
a
word
and
walked
away
an
hour
later
the
desk
was
brought
to
the
little
house
on
the
viroflay
road
where
the
professor
lived
he
called
his
daughter
this
is
for
you
suzanne
that
is
if
you
like
it
suzanne
was
a
pretty
creature
of
a
demonstrative
temperament
and
easily
pleased
she
threw
her
arms
round
her
father
neck
and
kissed
him
as
rapturously
as
though
he
had
made
her
a
present
fit
for
a
queen
that
evening
assisted
by
hortense
the
maid
she
carried
up
the
desk
to
her
room
cleaned
out
the
drawers
and
neatly
put
away
her
papers
her
stationery
her
correspondence
her
picture
postcards
and
a
few
secret
souvenirs
of
her
cousin
philippe
gerbois
went
to
the
college
at
seven
the
next
morning
at
ten
suzanne
according
to
her
daily
custom
went
to
meet
him
at
the
exit
and
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
him
to
see
her
graceful
smiling
figure
waiting
on
the
pavement
opposite
the
gate
they
walked
home
together
and
how
do
you
like
the
desk
oh
it
lovely
hortense
and
i
have
polished
up
the
brass
handles
till
they
shine
like
gold
so
you
pleased
with
it
i
should
think
so
i
do
know
how
i
did
without
it
all
this
time
they
walked
up
the
front
garden
the
professor
said
let
go
and
look
at
it
before
lunch
yes
that
a
good
idea
she
went
up
the
stairs
first
but
on
reaching
the
door
of
her
room
she
gave
a
cry
of
dismay
what
the
matter
exclaimed
gerbois
he
followed
her
into
the
room
the
was
gone
what
astonished
the
police
was
the
wonderful
simplicity
of
the
means
employed
while
suzanne
was
out
and
the
maid
making
her
purchases
for
the
day
a
wearing
his
badge
had
stopped
his
cart
before
the
garden
in
sight
of
the
neighbours
and
rung
the
bell
twice
the
neighbours
not
knowing
that
the
servant
had
left
the
house
suspected
nothing
so
that
the
man
was
able
to
effect
his
object
absolutely
undisturbed
this
fact
must
be
noted
not
a
cupboard
had
been
broken
open
not
so
much
as
a
clock
displaced
even
suzanne
purse
which
she
had
left
on
the
marble
slab
of
the
desk
was
found
on
the
adjacent
table
with
the
gold
which
it
contained
the
object
of
the
theft
was
clearly
determined
therefore
and
this
made
it
the
more
difficult
to
understand
for
after
all
why
should
a
man
run
so
great
a
risk
to
secure
so
trivial
a
spoil
the
only
clue
which
the
professor
could
supply
was
the
incident
of
the
day
before
from
the
first
that
young
man
displayed
a
keen
annoyance
at
my
refusal
and
i
have
a
positive
impression
that
he
left
me
under
a
threat
it
was
all
very
vague
the
dealer
was
questioned
he
knew
neither
of
the
two
gentlemen
as
for
the
desk
he
had
bought
it
for
forty
francs
at
chevreuse
at
the
sale
of
a
person
deceased
and
he
considered
that
he
had
it
at
a
fair
price
a
persistent
inquiry
revealed
nothing
further
but
gerbois
remained
convinced
that
he
had
suffered
an
enormous
loss
a
fortune
must
have
been
concealed
in
some
secret
drawer
and
that
was
why
the
young
man
knowing
of
the
had
acted
with
such
decision
poor
father
what
should
we
have
done
with
the
fortune
suzanne
kept
saying
what
why
with
that
for
your
dowry
you
could
have
made
the
finest
match
going
suzanne
aimed
at
no
one
higher
than
her
cousin
philippe
who
had
not
a
penny
to
bless
himself
with
and
she
gave
a
bitter
sigh
and
life
in
the
little
house
at
versailles
went
on
gaily
less
carelessly
than
before
shadowed
over
as
it
now
was
with
regret
and
disappointment
two
months
elapsed
and
suddenly
one
after
the
other
came
a
sequence
of
the
most
serious
events
forming
a
surprising
run
of
alternate
luck
and
misfortune
on
the
of
february
at
five
gerbois
who
had
just
come
home
with
an
evening
paper
in
his
hand
sat
down
put
on
his
spectacles
and
began
to
read
the
political
news
was
uninteresting
he
turned
the
page
and
a
paragraph
at
once
caught
his
eye
headed
third
drawing
of
the
lottery
first
prize
francs
no
series
the
paper
dropped
from
his
hands
the
walls
swam
before
his
eyes
and
his
heart
stopped
beating
number
series
was
the
number
of
his
ticket
he
had
bought
it
by
accident
to
oblige
one
of
his
friends
for
he
did
not
believe
in
luck
and
now
he
had
won
he
took
out
his
quick
he
was
quite
right
number
series
was
jotted
down
on
the
but
where
was
the
ticket
he
flew
to
his
study
to
fetch
the
box
of
stationery
in
which
he
had
put
the
precious
ticket
away
and
he
stopped
short
as
he
entered
and
staggered
back
with
a
pain
at
his
heart
the
box
was
not
there
and
what
an
awful
thing
he
suddenly
realized
that
the
box
had
not
been
there
for
weeks
suzanne
suzanne
she
had
just
come
in
and
ran
up
the
stairs
hurriedly
he
stammered
in
a
choking
voice
suzanne
the
box
the
box
of
stationery
which
one
the
one
i
bought
at
louvre
on
a
thursday
it
used
to
stand
at
the
end
of
the
table
but
do
you
remember
father
we
put
it
away
together
when
that
evening
you
know
the
day
before
but
where
quick
tell
me
it
more
than
i
can
bear
where
in
the
in
the
desk
that
was
stolen
yes
in
the
desk
that
was
stolen
he
repeated
the
words
in
a
whisper
with
a
sort
of
terror
then
he
took
her
hand
and
lower
still
it
contained
a
million
suzanne
oh
father
why
did
you
tell
me
she
murmured
innocently
a
million
he
repeated
it
was
the
winning
number
in
the
press
lottery
the
hugeness
of
the
disaster
crushed
them
and
for
a
long
time
they
maintained
a
silence
which
they
had
not
the
courage
to
break
at
last
suzanne
said
but
father
they
will
pay
you
all
the
same
why
on
what
evidence
does
it
require
evidence
of
course
and
have
you
none
yes
i
have
well
it
was
in
the
box
in
the
box
that
has
disappeared
yes
and
the
other
man
will
get
the
money
why
that
would
be
outrageous
surely
father
you
can
stop
the
payment
who
knows
who
knows
that
man
must
be
extraordinarily
clever
he
has
such
wonderful
resources
remember
think
how
he
got
hold
of
the
desk
his
energy
revived
he
sprang
up
and
stamping
his
foot
on
the
floor
no
no
no
he
shouted
he
sha
have
that
million
he
sha
why
should
he
after
all
sharp
as
he
may
be
he
can
do
nothing
either
if
he
calls
for
the
money
they
lock
him
up
ah
we
shall
see
my
friend
have
you
thought
of
something
father
i
shall
defend
our
rights
to
the
bitter
end
come
what
may
and
we
shall
succeed
the
million
belongs
to
me
and
i
mean
to
have
it
a
few
minutes
later
he
dispatched
this
telegram
governor
crédit
foncier
rue
capucines
paris
am
owner
number
series
oppose
by
every
legal
method
payment
to
any
other
person
gerbois
at
almost
the
same
time
the
crédit
foncier
received
another
telegram
number
series
is
in
my
possession
arsène
lupin
whenever
i
sit
down
to
tell
one
of
the
numberless
adventures
which
compose
the
life
of
arsène
lupin
i
feel
a
genuine
embarrassment
because
it
is
quite
clear
to
me
that
even
the
least
important
of
these
adventures
is
known
to
every
one
of
my
readers
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
not
a
move
on
the
part
of
our
national
thief
as
he
has
been
happily
called
but
has
been
described
all
over
the
country
not
an
exploit
but
has
been
studied
from
every
point
of
view
not
an
action
but
has
been
commented
upon
with
an
abundance
of
detail
generally
reserved
for
stories
of
heroic
deeds
who
for
instance
does
not
know
that
strange
case
of
the
blonde
lady
with
the
curious
episodes
which
were
reported
under
flaring
headlines
as
number
series
the
murder
in
the
avenue
and
the
blue
diamond
what
an
excitement
there
was
about
the
intervention
of
holmlock
shears
the
famous
english
detective
what
an
effervescence
surrounded
the
varying
fortunes
that
marked
the
struggle
between
those
two
great
artists
and
what
a
din
along
the
boulevards
on
the
day
when
the
newsboys
shouted
arrest
of
arsène
lupin
my
excuse
is
that
i
can
supply
something
new
i
can
furnish
the
key
to
the
puzzle
there
is
always
a
certain
mystery
about
these
adventures
i
can
dispel
it
i
reprint
articles
that
have
been
read
over
and
over
again
i
copy
out
old
interviews
but
all
these
things
i
rearrange
and
classify
and
put
to
the
exact
test
of
truth
my
collaborator
in
this
work
is
arsène
lupin
himself
whose
kindness
to
me
is
inexhaustible
i
am
also
under
an
occasional
obligation
to
the
unspeakable
wilson
the
friend
and
confidant
of
holmlock
shears
my
readers
will
remember
the
homeric
laughter
that
greeted
the
publication
of
the
two
telegrams
the
name
of
arsène
lupin
alone
was
a
guarantee
of
originality
a
promise
of
amusement
for
the
gallery
and
the
gallery
in
this
case
was
the
whole
world
an
inquiry
was
immediately
set
on
foot
by
the
crédit
foncier
and
it
was
ascertained
that
number
series
had
been
sold
by
the
versailles
branch
of
the
crédit
lyonnais
to
major
bressy
of
the
artillery
now
the
major
had
died
of
a
fall
from
his
horse
and
it
appeared
that
he
told
his
brother
officers
some
time
before
his
death
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
part
with
his
ticket
to
a
friend
that
friend
was
myself
declared
gerbois
prove
it
objected
the
governor
of
the
crédit
foncier
prove
it
that
quite
easy
twenty
people
will
tell
you
that
i
kept
up
constant
relations
with
the
major
and
that
we
used
to
meet
at
the
café
on
the
place
it
was
there
that
one
day
to
oblige
him
in
a
moment
of
financial
embarrassment
i
took
his
ticket
off
him
and
gave
him
twenty
francs
for
it
have
you
any
witnesses
to
the
transaction
no
then
upon
what
do
you
base
your
claim
upon
the
letter
which
he
wrote
me
on
the
subject
what
letter
a
letter
pinned
to
the
ticket
produce
it
but
it
was
in
the
stolen
find
it
the
letter
was
communicated
to
the
press
by
arsène
lupin
a
paragraph
inserted
in
the
de
which
has
the
honour
of
being
his
official
organ
and
in
which
he
seems
to
be
one
of
the
principal
shareholders
announced
that
he
was
placing
in
the
hands
of
maître
detinan
his
counsel
the
letter
which
major
bressy
had
written
to
him
lupin
personally
there
was
a
burst
of
delight
arsène
lupin
was
represented
by
counsel
arsène
lupin
respecting
established
customs
had
appointed
a
member
of
the
bar
to
act
for
him
the
reporters
rushed
to
interview
maître
detinan
an
influential
radical
deputy
a
man
endowed
with
the
highest
integrity
and
a
mind
of
uncommon
shrewdness
which
was
at
the
same
time
somewhat
skeptical
and
given
to
paradox
maître
detinan
was
exceedingly
sorry
to
say
that
he
had
never
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
arsène
lupin
but
he
had
in
point
of
fact
received
his
instructions
was
greatly
flattered
at
being
selected
keenly
alive
to
the
honour
shown
him
and
determined
to
defend
his
client
rights
to
the
utmost
he
opened
his
brief
and
without
hesitation
showed
the
major
letter
it
proved
the
sale
of
the
ticket
but
did
not
mention
the
purchaser
name
it
began
my
dear
friend
simply
dear
friend
means
me
added
arsène
lupin
in
a
note
enclosing
the
major
letter
and
the
best
proof
is
that
i
have
the
letter
the
bevy
of
reporters
at
once
flew
off
to
gerbois
who
could
do
nothing
but
repeat
dear
friend
is
no
one
but
myself
arsène
lupin
stole
the
letter
with
the
tell
him
to
prove
it
was
lupin
rejoinder
to
the
journalists
but
he
stole
the
desk
exclaimed
gerbois
in
front
of
the
same
journalists
tell
him
to
prove
it
retorted
lupin
once
again
and
a
delightful
entertainment
was
provided
for
the
public
by
this
duel
between
the
two
owners
of
number
series
by
the
constant
coming
and
going
of
the
journalists
and
by
the
coolness
of
arsène
lupin
as
opposed
to
the
frenzy
of
poor
gerbois
unhappy
man
the
press
was
full
of
his
lamentations
he
confessed
the
full
extent
of
his
misfortunes
in
a
touchingly
ingenuous
way
it
suzanne
dowry
gentlemen
that
the
villain
has
stolen
for
myself
personally
i
do
care
but
for
suzanne
just
think
a
million
ten
hundred
thousand
francs
ah
i
always
said
the
desk
contained
a
treasure
he
was
told
in
vain
that
his
adversary
when
taking
away
the
desk
knew
nothing
of
the
existence
of
the
and
that
in
any
case
no
one
could
have
foreseen
that
this
particular
ticket
would
win
the
first
prize
all
he
did
was
to
moan
do
talk
to
me
of
course
he
knew
if
not
why
should
he
have
taken
the
trouble
to
steal
that
wretched
desk
for
unknown
reasons
but
certainly
not
to
get
hold
of
a
scrap
of
paper
which
at
that
time
was
worth
the
modest
sum
of
twenty
francs
the
sum
of
a
million
he
knew
it
he
knows
everything
ah
you
do
know
the
sort
of
a
man
he
is
the
ruffian
he
has
defrauded
you
of
a
million
you
see
this
talk
could
have
gone
on
a
long
time
yet
but
twelve
days
later
gerbois
received
a
letter
from
arsène
lupin
marked
private
and
confidential
which
worried
him
not
a
little
dear
sir
the
gallery
is
amusing
itself
at
our
expense
do
you
not
think
that
the
time
has
come
to
be
serious
i
for
my
part
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
the
position
is
clear
i
hold
a
ticket
which
i
am
not
entitled
to
cash
and
you
are
entitled
to
cash
a
ticket
which
you
do
not
hold
therefore
neither
of
us
can
do
anything
without
the
other
now
you
would
not
consent
to
surrender
rights
to
nor
i
to
give
up
ticket
to
what
are
we
to
do
i
see
only
one
way
out
of
the
difficulty
let
us
divide
half
a
million
for
you
half
a
million
for
me
is
not
that
fair
and
would
not
this
judgment
of
solomon
satisfy
the
sense
of
justice
in
each
of
us
i
propose
this
as
an
equitable
solution
but
also
an
immediate
solution
it
is
not
an
offer
which
you
have
time
to
discuss
but
a
necessity
before
which
circumstances
compel
you
to
bow
i
give
you
three
days
for
reflection
i
hope
that
on
friday
morning
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
a
discreet
advertisement
in
the
of
the
de
addressed
to
ars
lup
and
containing
in
veiled
terms
your
unreserved
assent
to
the
compact
which
i
am
suggesting
to
you
in
that
event
you
will
at
once
recover
possession
of
the
ticket
and
receive
the
million
on
the
understanding
that
you
will
hand
me
five
hundred
thousand
francs
in
a
way
which
i
will
indicate
hereafter
should
you
refuse
i
have
taken
measures
that
will
produce
exactly
the
same
result
but
apart
from
the
very
serious
trouble
which
your
obstinacy
would
bring
upon
you
you
would
be
the
poorer
by
thousand
francs
which
i
should
have
to
deduct
for
additional
expenses
i
am
dear
sir
very
respectfully
yours
arsène
lupin
gerbois
in
his
exasperation
was
guilty
of
the
colossal
blunder
of
showing
this
letter
and
allowing
it
to
be
copied
his
indignation
drove
him
to
every
sort
of
folly
not
a
penny
he
shall
not
have
a
penny
he
shouted
before
the
assembled
reporters
share
what
belongs
to
me
never
let
him
tear
up
his
ticket
if
he
likes
still
half
a
million
francs
is
better
than
nothing
it
not
a
question
of
that
but
of
my
rights
and
those
rights
i
shall
establish
in
a
court
of
law
go
to
law
with
arsène
lupin
that
would
be
funny
no
but
the
crédit
foncier
they
are
bound
to
hand
me
the
million
against
the
ticket
or
at
least
against
evidence
that
you
bought
it
the
evidence
exists
seeing
that
arsène
lupin
admits
that
he
stole
the
desk
what
judge
is
going
to
take
arsène
lupin
word
i
do
care
i
shall
go
to
law
the
gallery
was
delighted
bets
were
made
some
people
being
certain
that
lupin
would
bring
gerbois
to
terms
others
that
he
would
not
go
beyond
threats
and
the
people
felt
a
sort
of
apprehension
for
the
adversaries
were
unevenly
matched
the
one
being
so
fierce
in
his
attacks
while
the
other
was
as
frightened
as
a
hunted
deer
on
friday
there
was
a
rush
for
the
de
and
the
on
the
fifth
page
was
scanned
with
feverish
eyes
there
was
not
a
line
addressed
to
ars
lup
gerbois
had
replied
to
arsène
lupin
demands
with
silence
it
was
a
declaration
of
war
that
evening
the
papers
contained
the
news
that
mlle
gerbois
had
been
kidnapped
the
most
delightful
factor
in
what
i
may
call
the
arsène
lupin
entertainment
is
the
eminently
ludicrous
part
played
by
the
police
everything
passes
outside
their
knowledge
lupin
speaks
writes
warns
orders
threatens
carries
out
his
plans
as
though
there
were
no
police
no
detectives
no
magistrates
no
impediment
of
any
kind
in
existence
they
seem
of
no
account
to
him
whatever
no
obstacle
enters
into
his
calculations
and
yet
the
police
struggle
to
do
their
best
the
moment
the
name
of
arsène
lupin
is
mentioned
the
whole
force
from
top
to
bottom
takes
fire
boils
and
foams
with
rage
he
is
the
enemy
the
enemy
who
mocks
you
provokes
you
despises
you
or
even
worse
ignores
you
and
what
can
one
do
against
an
enemy
like
that
according
to
the
evidence
of
the
servant
suzanne
went
out
at
twenty
minutes
to
ten
at
five
minutes
past
ten
her
father
on
leaving
the
college
failed
to
see
her
on
the
pavement
where
she
usually
waited
for
him
everything
therefore
must
have
taken
place
in
the
course
of
the
short
twenty
minutes
walk
which
brought
suzanne
from
her
door
to
the
college
or
at
least
quite
close
to
the
college
two
neighbours
declared
that
they
had
passed
her
about
three
hundred
yards
from
the
house
a
lady
had
seen
a
girl
walking
along
the
avenue
whose
description
corresponded
with
suzanne
after
that
all
was
blank
inquiries
were
made
on
every
side
the
officials
at
the
and
the
were
questioned
they
had
seen
nothing
on
that
day
which
could
relate
to
the
kidnapping
of
a
young
girl
however
a
grocer
at
stated
that
he
had
supplied
a
closed
coming
from
paris
with
petrol
there
was
a
chauffeur
on
the
front
seat
and
a
lady
with
fair
hair
exceedingly
fair
hair
the
witness
said
inside
the
car
returned
from
versailles
an
hour
later
a
block
in
the
traffic
compelled
it
to
slacken
speed
and
the
grocer
was
able
to
perceive
that
there
was
now
another
lady
seated
beside
the
blonde
lady
whom
he
had
seen
first
this
second
lady
was
wrapped
up
in
veils
and
shawls
no
doubt
it
was
suzanne
gerbois
consequently
the
abduction
must
have
taken
place
in
broad
daylight
on
a
busy
road
in
the
very
heart
of
the
town
how
at
what
spot
not
a
cry
had
been
heard
not
a
suspicious
movement
observed
the
grocer
described
the
car
a
peugeot
limousine
with
a
dark
blue
body
inquiries
were
made
on
chance
of
mme
the
manageress
of
the
grand
garage
who
used
to
make
a
specialty
of
elopements
she
had
in
fact
on
friday
morning
hired
out
a
peugeot
limousine
for
the
day
to
a
lady
whom
she
had
not
seen
since
but
the
driver
he
was
a
man
called
ernest
whom
i
engaged
the
day
before
on
the
strength
of
his
excellent
testimonials
is
he
here
no
he
brought
back
the
car
and
has
not
been
here
since
ca
we
get
hold
of
him
certainly
by
applying
to
the
people
who
recommended
him
i
will
give
you
the
addresses
the
police
called
on
these
persons
none
of
them
knew
the
man
called
ernest
and
every
trail
which
they
followed
to
find
their
way
out
of
the
darkness
led
only
to
greater
darkness
and
denser
fogs
gerbois
was
not
the
man
to
maintain
a
contest
which
had
opened
in
so
disastrous
a
fashion
for
him
inconsolable
at
the
disappearance
of
his
daughter
and
pricked
with
remorse
he
capitulated
an
advertisement
which
appeared
in
the
de
and
aroused
general
comment
proclaimed
his
absolute
and
unreserved
surrender
it
was
a
complete
defeat
the
war
was
over
in
four
times
hours
two
days
later
gerbois
walked
across
the
courtyard
of
the
crédit
foncier
he
was
shown
in
to
the
governor
and
handed
him
number
series
the
governor
gave
a
start
oh
so
you
have
it
did
they
give
it
back
to
you
i
mislaid
it
and
here
it
is
replied
gerbois
but
you
said
there
was
a
question
that
all
lies
and
but
nevertheless
we
should
require
some
corroborative
document
will
the
major
letter
do
certainly
here
it
is
very
well
please
leave
these
papers
with
us
we
are
allowed
a
fortnight
in
which
to
verify
them
i
will
let
you
know
when
you
can
call
for
the
money
in
the
meanwhile
i
think
that
you
would
be
to
say
nothing
and
to
complete
this
business
in
the
most
absolute
silence
that
is
what
i
intend
to
do
gerbois
did
not
speak
nor
the
governor
either
but
there
are
certain
secrets
which
leak
out
without
any
indiscretion
having
been
committed
and
the
public
suddenly
learnt
that
arsène
lupin
had
had
the
pluck
to
send
number
series
back
to
gerbois
the
news
was
received
with
a
sort
of
stupefied
admiration
what
a
bold
player
he
must
be
to
fling
so
important
a
trump
as
the
precious
ticket
upon
the
table
true
he
had
parted
with
it
wittingly
in
exchange
for
a
card
which
equalized
the
chances
but
suppose
the
girl
escaped
suppose
they
succeeded
in
recapturing
his
hostage
the
police
perceived
the
enemy
weak
point
and
redoubled
their
efforts
with
arsène
lupin
disarmed
and
despoiled
by
himself
caught
in
his
own
toils
receiving
not
a
single
sou
of
the
coveted
million
the
laugh
would
at
once
be
on
the
other
side
but
the
question
was
to
find
suzanne
and
they
did
not
find
her
nor
did
she
escape
very
well
people
said
that
settled
arsène
has
won
the
first
game
but
the
difficult
part
is
still
to
come
mlle
gerbois
is
in
his
hands
we
admit
and
he
will
not
hand
her
over
without
the
five
hundred
thousand
francs
but
how
and
where
is
the
exchange
to
take
place
for
the
exchange
to
take
place
there
must
be
a
meeting
and
what
is
to
prevent
gerbois
from
informing
the
police
and
thus
both
recovering
his
daughter
and
keeping
the
money
the
professor
was
interviewed
greatly
cast
down
longing
only
for
silence
he
remained
impenetrable
i
have
nothing
to
say
i
am
waiting
and
mlle
gerbois
the
search
is
being
continued
but
arsène
lupin
has
written
to
you
no
do
you
swear
that
no
that
means
yes
what
are
his
instructions
i
have
nothing
to
say
maître
detinan
was
next
besieged
and
showed
the
same
discretion
lupin
is
my
client
he
replied
with
an
affectation
of
gravity
you
will
understand
that
i
am
bound
to
maintain
the
most
absolute
reserve
all
these
mysteries
annoyed
the
gallery
plots
were
evidently
hatching
in
the
dark
arsène
lupin
was
arranging
and
tightening
the
meshes
of
his
nets
while
the
police
were
keeping
up
a
watch
by
day
and
night
round
gerbois
and
people
discussed
the
only
three
possible
endings
arrest
triumph
or
grotesque
and
pitiful
failure
but
as
it
happened
public
curiosity
was
destined
to
be
only
partially
satisfied
and
the
exact
truth
is
revealed
for
the
first
time
in
these
pages
on
thursday
the
of
march
gerbois
received
the
notice
from
the
crédit
foncier
in
an
ordinary
envelope
at
one
on
friday
he
took
the
train
for
paris
a
thousand
notes
of
a
thousand
francs
each
were
handed
to
him
at
two
while
he
was
counting
them
over
one
by
one
with
trembling
hands
for
was
this
money
not
suzanne
ransom
two
men
sat
talking
in
a
cab
drawn
up
at
a
short
distance
from
the
main
entrance
one
of
these
men
had
grizzled
hair
and
a
powerful
face
which
contrasted
oddly
with
his
dress
and
bearing
which
was
that
of
a
small
clerk
it
was
ganimard
old
ganimard
lupin
implacable
enemy
and
ganimard
said
to
folenfant
the
old
chap
wo
be
long
we
shall
see
him
come
out
in
five
minutes
is
everything
ready
quite
how
many
are
we
eight
including
two
on
bicycles
and
myself
who
count
as
three
it
enough
but
not
too
many
that
gerbois
must
not
escape
us
at
any
price
if
he
does
we
diddled
he
meet
lupin
at
the
place
they
have
agreed
upon
he
swap
the
young
lady
for
the
and
the
trick
done
but
why
on
earth
wo
the
old
chap
act
with
us
it
would
be
so
simple
by
giving
us
a
hand
in
the
game
he
could
keep
the
whole
million
yes
but
he
afraid
if
he
tries
to
jockey
the
other
he
wo
get
his
daughter
back
what
other
him
ganimard
pronounced
this
word
him
in
a
grave
and
rather
tone
as
though
he
were
speaking
of
a
supernatural
being
who
had
already
played
him
a
nasty
trick
or
two
it
very
strange
said
sergeant
folenfant
judiciously
that
we
should
be
reduced
to
protecting
that
gentleman
against
himself
with
lupin
everything
is
upside
down
sighed
ganimard
a
minute
elapsed
look
out
he
said
gerbois
was
leaving
the
bank
when
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
rue
des
capucines
he
turned
down
the
boulevard
keeping
to
the
side
he
walked
away
slowly
along
the
shops
and
looked
into
the
windows
our
friend
too
quiet
said
ganimard
a
fellow
with
a
million
in
his
pocket
does
not
keep
so
quiet
as
all
that
what
can
he
do
oh
nothing
of
course
no
matter
i
mistrust
him
it
lupin
lupin
at
that
moment
gerbois
went
to
a
kiosk
bought
some
newspapers
took
his
change
unfolded
one
of
the
sheets
and
with
outstretched
arms
began
to
read
while
walking
on
with
short
steps
and
suddenly
with
a
bound
he
jumped
into
a
which
was
waiting
beside
the
curb
the
power
must
have
been
on
for
the
car
drove
off
rapidly
turned
the
corner
of
the
madeleine
and
disappeared
by
jupiter
cried
ganimard
another
of
his
inventions
he
darted
forward
and
other
men
at
the
same
time
as
himself
ran
round
the
madeleine
but
he
burst
out
laughing
the
had
broken
down
at
the
beginning
of
the
boulevard
malesherbes
and
gerbois
was
getting
out
quick
folenfant
the
driver
perhaps
it
the
man
called
ernest
folenfant
tackled
the
chauffeur
it
was
a
man
called
gaston
one
of
the
company
drivers
a
gentleman
had
engaged
him
ten
minutes
before
and
had
told
him
to
wait
by
the
with
steam
up
until
another
gentleman
came
and
what
address
did
the
second
fare
give
asked
folenfant
he
gave
me
no
address
malesherbes
avenue
de
messine
give
you
an
extra
tip
that
all
he
said
during
this
time
however
gerbois
without
losing
a
minute
had
sprung
into
the
first
passing
cab
drive
to
the
concorde
the
professor
left
the
tube
at
the
place
du
hurried
into
another
cab
and
drove
to
the
place
de
la
bourse
here
he
went
by
tube
again
as
far
as
the
avenue
de
villiers
where
he
took
a
third
cab
rue
clapeyron
no
rue
clapeyron
is
separated
from
the
boulevard
des
batignolles
by
the
house
at
the
corner
the
professor
went
up
to
the
first
floor
and
rang
a
gentleman
opened
the
door
does
maître
detinan
live
here
i
am
maître
detinan
gerbois
i
presume
that
it
i
was
expecting
you
pray
come
in
when
gerbois
entered
the
lawyer
office
the
clock
was
striking
three
and
he
at
once
said
this
is
the
time
he
appointed
is
he
here
not
yet
gerbois
sat
down
wiped
his
forehead
looked
at
his
watch
as
though
he
did
not
know
the
time
and
continued
anxiously
will
he
come
the
lawyer
replied
you
are
asking
me
something
sir
which
i
myself
am
most
curious
to
know
i
have
never
felt
so
impatient
in
my
life
in
any
case
if
he
comes
he
is
taking
a
big
risk
for
the
house
has
been
closely
watched
for
the
past
fortnight
they
suspect
me
and
me
even
more
said
the
professor
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
the
detectives
set
to
watch
me
have
been
thrown
off
my
track
but
then
it
would
not
be
my
fault
cried
the
professor
vehemently
and
he
can
have
nothing
to
reproach
me
with
what
did
i
promise
to
do
to
obey
his
orders
well
i
have
obeyed
his
orders
blindly
i
cashed
the
ticket
at
the
time
which
he
fixed
and
came
on
to
you
in
the
manner
which
he
ordered
i
am
responsible
for
my
daughter
misfortune
and
i
have
kept
my
engagements
in
all
good
faith
it
is
for
him
to
keep
his
and
he
added
in
an
anxious
voice
he
will
bring
back
my
daughter
wo
he
i
hope
so
still
you
seen
him
i
no
he
simply
wrote
asking
me
to
receive
you
both
to
send
away
my
servants
before
three
and
to
let
no
one
into
my
flat
between
the
time
of
your
arrival
and
his
departure
if
i
did
not
consent
to
this
proposal
he
begged
me
to
let
him
know
by
means
of
two
lines
in
the
de
but
i
am
only
too
pleased
to
do
arsène
lupin
a
service
and
i
consent
to
everything
gerbois
moaned
oh
dear
how
will
it
all
end
he
took
the
from
his
pocket
spread
them
on
the
table
and
divided
them
into
two
bundles
of
five
hundred
each
then
the
two
men
sat
silent
from
time
to
time
gerbois
pricked
up
his
ears
was
that
a
ring
at
the
his
anguish
increased
with
every
minute
that
passed
and
maître
detinan
also
experienced
an
impression
that
was
almost
painful
for
a
moment
in
fact
the
advocate
lost
all
his
composure
he
rose
abruptly
from
his
seat
we
sha
see
him
how
can
we
expect
to
it
would
be
madness
on
his
part
he
trusts
us
no
doubt
we
are
honest
men
incapable
of
betraying
him
but
the
danger
lies
elsewhere
and
gerbois
shattered
with
his
hands
on
the
notes
stammered
if
he
would
only
come
oh
if
he
would
only
come
i
would
give
all
this
to
have
suzanne
back
the
door
opened
half
will
do
m
gerbois
some
one
was
standing
on
the
threshold
a
young
man
fashionably
dressed
and
gerbois
at
once
recognized
the
person
who
had
accosted
him
outside
the
he
leapt
toward
him
and
suzanne
where
is
my
daughter
arsène
lupin
closed
the
door
carefully
and
quietly
unbuttoning
his
gloves
said
to
the
lawyer
my
dear
maître
i
can
never
thank
you
sufficiently
for
your
kindness
in
consenting
to
defend
my
rights
i
shall
not
forget
it
maître
detinan
could
only
murmur
but
you
never
rang
i
did
not
hear
the
door
bells
and
doors
are
things
that
have
to
do
their
work
without
ever
being
heard
i
am
here
all
the
same
and
that
is
the
great
thing
my
daughter
suzanne
what
have
you
done
with
her
repeated
the
professor
heavens
sir
said
lupin
what
a
hurry
you
in
come
calm
yourself
your
daughter
will
be
in
your
arms
in
a
moment
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
and
then
in
the
tone
of
a
magnate
distributing
praises
i
congratulate
you
gerbois
on
the
skilful
way
in
which
you
acted
just
now
if
the
motor
had
had
that
ridiculous
accident
we
should
simply
have
met
at
the
étoile
and
saved
maître
detinan
the
annoyance
of
this
visit
however
it
was
destined
otherwise
he
caught
sight
of
the
two
bundles
of
and
cried
ah
that
right
the
million
is
there
let
us
waste
no
time
will
you
allow
me
but
said
maître
detinan
placing
himself
in
front
of
the
table
mlle
gerbois
is
not
here
yet
well
well
is
her
presence
indispensable
i
see
i
see
arsène
lupin
inspires
only
a
partial
confidence
he
pockets
his
without
restoring
the
hostage
ah
my
dear
maître
i
am
sadly
misunderstood
because
fate
has
obliged
me
to
perform
acts
of
a
rather
special
character
doubts
are
cast
upon
my
good
faith
mine
i
a
man
all
scruples
and
delicacy
however
my
dear
maître
if
you
afraid
open
your
window
and
call
out
there
are
quite
a
dozen
detectives
in
the
street
do
you
think
so
arsène
lupin
raised
the
blind
i
doubt
if
gerbois
is
capable
of
throwing
ganimard
off
the
scent
what
did
i
tell
you
there
he
is
the
dear
old
chap
impossible
cried
the
professor
i
swear
to
you
though
that
you
have
not
betrayed
me
i
do
doubt
it
but
the
fellows
are
clever
look
there
folenfant
and
gréaume
and
dieuzy
all
my
best
pals
what
maître
detinan
looked
at
him
in
surprise
what
calmness
he
was
laughing
with
a
happy
laugh
as
though
he
were
amusing
himself
at
some
game
with
no
danger
threatening
him
this
carelessness
did
even
more
than
the
sight
of
the
detectives
to
reassure
the
lawyer
he
moved
away
from
the
table
on
which
the
lay
arsène
lupin
took
up
the
two
bundles
one
after
the
other
counted
notes
from
each
of
them
and
handing
the
lawyer
the
fifty
thus
obtained
said
gerbois
share
of
your
fee
my
dear
maître
and
arsène
lupin
we
owe
you
that
you
owe
me
nothing
said
maître
detinan
what
after
all
the
trouble
we
given
you
you
forget
the
pleasure
it
has
been
to
me
to
take
that
trouble
you
mean
to
say
my
dear
maître
that
you
refuse
to
accept
anything
from
arsène
lupin
that
the
worst
he
sighed
of
having
a
bad
reputation
he
held
out
the
fifty
thousand
francs
to
the
professor
monsieur
let
me
give
you
this
in
memory
of
our
pleasant
meeting
it
will
be
my
to
mlle
gerbois
gerbois
snatched
at
the
notes
but
protested
my
daughter
is
not
being
married
she
ca
be
married
if
you
refuse
your
consent
but
she
is
dying
to
be
married
what
do
you
know
about
it
i
know
that
young
ladies
often
cherish
dreams
without
papa
consent
fortunately
there
are
good
geniuses
called
arsène
lupin
who
discover
the
secret
of
those
charming
souls
hidden
away
in
their
did
you
discover
nothing
else
asked
maître
detinan
i
confess
that
i
am
very
curious
to
know
why
that
desk
was
the
object
of
your
attentions
historical
reasons
my
dear
maître
although
contrary
to
opinion
it
contained
no
treasure
beyond
the
of
which
i
did
not
know
i
wanted
it
and
had
been
looking
for
it
for
some
time
the
desk
which
is
made
of
yew
and
mahogany
decorated
with
capitals
was
found
in
marie
walewska
discreet
little
house
at
and
has
an
inscription
on
one
of
the
drawers
to
napoleon
emperor
of
the
french
by
his
most
faithful
servant
underneath
are
these
words
carved
with
the
point
of
a
knife
napoleon
had
it
copied
afterward
for
the
empress
josephine
so
that
the
which
people
used
to
admire
at
the
malmaison
and
which
they
still
admire
at
the
is
only
an
imperfect
copy
of
the
one
which
now
forms
part
of
my
collection
gerbois
sighed
oh
dear
if
i
had
only
known
this
at
the
shop
how
willingly
i
would
have
let
you
have
it
arsène
lupin
laughed
yes
and
you
would
besides
have
had
the
appreciable
advantage
of
keeping
the
whole
of
number
series
for
yourself
and
you
would
not
have
thought
of
kidnapping
my
daughter
whom
all
this
business
must
needs
have
upset
all
what
business
the
abduction
but
my
dear
sir
you
are
quite
mistaken
mlle
gerbois
was
not
abducted
my
daughter
was
not
abducted
not
at
all
kidnapping
abduction
implies
violence
now
mlle
gerbois
acted
as
a
hostage
of
her
own
free
will
of
her
own
free
will
repeated
the
professor
in
confusion
and
almost
at
her
own
request
why
a
young
lady
like
mlle
gerbois
who
moreover
harbours
a
secret
passion
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
was
hardly
likely
to
refuse
the
opportunity
of
securing
her
dowry
oh
i
assure
you
it
was
easy
enough
to
make
her
understand
that
there
was
no
other
way
of
overcoming
your
resistance
maître
detanin
was
greatly
amused
he
put
in
you
must
have
found
a
difficulty
in
coming
to
terms
i
ca
believe
that
mlle
gerbois
allowed
you
to
speak
to
her
i
did
i
have
not
even
the
honour
of
knowing
her
a
lady
of
my
acquaintance
was
good
enough
to
undertake
the
negotiations
the
blonde
lady
in
the
i
suppose
said
maître
detinan
just
so
everything
was
settled
at
the
first
interview
near
the
college
since
then
mlle
gerbois
and
her
new
friend
have
been
abroad
have
visited
belgium
and
holland
in
the
most
agreeable
and
instructive
manner
for
a
young
girl
however
she
will
tell
you
everything
herself
the
bell
rang
three
rings
in
quick
succession
then
a
single
ring
then
another
single
ring
there
she
is
said
lupin
my
dear
maître
if
you
would
not
mind
the
lawyer
ran
to
open
the
door
two
young
women
entered
one
of
them
flung
herself
into
arms
the
other
went
up
to
lupin
she
was
tall
and
shapely
with
a
very
pale
face
and
her
fair
hair
which
glittered
like
gold
was
parted
into
two
loosely
waved
bandeaux
dressed
in
black
wearing
no
ornament
beyond
a
jet
necklace
she
nevertheless
struck
a
note
of
elegance
and
refinement
arsène
lupin
spoke
a
few
words
to
her
and
then
bowing
to
mlle
gerbois
said
i
must
apologize
to
you
mademoiselle
for
all
this
annoyance
but
i
hope
nevertheless
that
you
have
not
been
too
unhappy
unhappy
i
should
even
have
been
very
happy
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
poor
father
then
all
is
for
the
best
embrace
him
once
more
and
take
the
opportunity
you
will
never
have
a
better
of
speaking
to
him
about
your
cousin
my
cousin
what
do
you
mean
i
do
understand
oh
i
think
you
understand
your
cousin
philippe
the
young
man
whose
letters
you
kept
so
preciously
suzanne
blushed
lost
countenance
and
then
taking
lupin
advice
threw
herself
once
more
into
her
father
arms
lupin
looked
at
them
both
with
a
melting
eye
ah
we
are
always
rewarded
for
doing
good
what
a
touching
sight
happy
father
happy
daughter
and
to
think
that
this
happiness
is
your
work
lupin
those
two
beings
will
bless
you
later
your
name
will
be
piously
handed
down
to
their
children
and
their
children
children
oh
family
life
family
life
he
turned
to
the
window
is
our
dear
ganimard
there
still
how
he
would
love
to
witness
this
charming
display
of
affection
but
no
he
is
not
there
there
is
nobody
they
all
gone
by
jove
the
position
is
growing
serious
i
should
wonder
if
they
were
in
the
gateway
by
now
or
by
the
porter
lodge
or
even
on
the
stairs
gerbois
made
an
involuntary
movement
now
that
his
daughter
was
restored
to
him
he
began
to
see
things
in
their
true
light
the
arrest
of
his
adversary
meant
half
a
million
to
him
instinctively
he
took
a
step
toward
the
door
lupin
barred
his
way
as
though
by
accident
where
are
you
going
gerbois
to
defend
me
against
them
you
are
too
kind
pray
do
trouble
besides
i
assure
you
they
are
more
perplexed
than
i
and
he
continued
reflectively
what
do
they
know
when
all
is
said
that
you
are
here
and
perhaps
that
mlle
gerbois
is
here
too
for
they
must
have
seen
her
come
with
an
unknown
lady
but
they
have
no
idea
that
i
am
here
how
could
i
have
entered
a
house
which
they
searched
this
morning
from
cellar
to
garret
no
in
all
probability
they
are
waiting
for
me
to
catch
me
on
the
wing
poor
fellows
unless
they
have
guessed
that
the
unknown
lady
was
sent
by
me
and
presume
that
she
has
been
commissioned
to
effect
the
exchange
in
that
case
they
are
preparing
to
arrest
her
when
she
leaves
the
bell
rang
lupin
stopped
gerbois
with
an
abrupt
gesture
and
in
a
harsh
and
peremptory
voice
said
stay
where
you
are
sir
think
of
your
daughter
and
be
reasonable
if
not
as
for
you
maître
detinan
i
have
your
word
gerbois
stood
rooted
to
the
floor
the
lawyer
did
not
move
lupin
took
up
his
hat
without
the
least
show
of
haste
there
was
a
little
dust
on
it
he
brushed
it
with
the
back
of
his
my
dear
maître
if
i
can
ever
be
of
use
to
you
my
best
wishes
mlle
suzanne
and
kind
regards
to
m
philippe
he
took
a
heavy
gold
hunter
from
his
pocket
gerbois
it
is
now
eighteen
minutes
to
four
i
authorize
you
to
leave
this
room
at
fourteen
minutes
to
four
not
a
moment
before
fourteen
minutes
to
four
is
it
understood
but
they
enter
by
force
maître
detinan
could
not
help
saying
you
forget
the
law
my
dear
maître
ganimard
would
never
dare
to
violate
the
sanctity
of
a
frenchman
home
we
should
have
time
for
a
pleasant
rubber
but
forgive
me
you
all
three
seem
a
little
upset
and
i
would
not
for
the
world
abuse
he
placed
the
watch
on
the
table
opened
the
door
of
the
room
and
addressing
the
lady
said
shall
we
go
dear
he
stood
back
for
her
to
pass
made
a
parting
and
very
respectful
bow
to
mlle
gerbois
walked
out
and
closed
the
door
after
him
and
they
heard
him
in
the
hall
saying
aloud
ganimard
how
are
you
remember
me
very
kindly
to
mme
ganimard
i
must
drop
in
on
her
to
lunch
one
of
these
days
ganimard
the
bell
rang
again
sharply
violently
followed
by
repeated
knocks
and
by
the
sound
of
voices
on
the
landing
a
quarter
to
four
stammered
gerbois
after
a
few
seconds
he
stepped
boldly
into
the
hall
arsène
lupin
and
the
lady
were
not
there
father
you
must
wait
cried
suzanne
wait
you
mad
show
consideration
to
that
scoundrel
and
what
about
the
he
opened
the
door
ganimard
rushed
in
where
that
lady
and
lupin
he
was
there
he
is
there
now
ganimard
gave
a
shout
of
triumph
we
got
him
the
house
is
surrounded
maître
detinan
objected
but
the
servants
staircase
the
servants
staircase
leads
to
the
courtyard
and
there
only
one
outlet
the
front
door
i
have
ten
men
watching
it
but
he
did
not
come
in
by
the
front
door
he
wo
go
out
that
way
either
which
way
then
jeered
ganimard
through
the
air
he
drew
back
a
curtain
a
long
passage
was
revealed
leading
to
the
kitchen
ganimard
ran
down
it
and
found
that
the
door
of
the
staircase
was
opening
the
window
he
called
to
one
of
the
detectives
seen
any
one
no
sir
then
he
exclaimed
they
are
in
the
flat
they
are
hiding
in
one
of
the
rooms
it
is
physically
impossible
for
them
to
have
escaped
ah
lupin
my
lad
you
did
me
once
but
i
having
my
revenge
this
time
at
seven
in
the
evening
astonished
at
receiving
no
news
the
head
of
the
dudouis
called
at
the
rue
clapeyron
in
person
he
put
a
few
questions
to
the
men
who
were
watching
the
house
and
then
went
up
to
maître
detinan
who
took
him
to
his
room
there
he
saw
a
man
or
rather
a
man
two
legs
struggling
on
the
carpet
while
the
body
to
which
they
belonged
was
stuffed
up
the
chimney
hi
hi
yelped
a
stifled
voice
and
a
more
distant
voice
from
right
above
echoed
hi
hi
dudouis
laughed
and
exclaimed
well
ganimard
what
are
you
playing
sweep
for
the
inspector
withdrew
his
body
from
the
chimney
he
was
unrecognizable
with
his
black
face
his
sooty
clothes
and
his
eyes
glowing
with
fever
i
looking
for
him
he
growled
for
whom
arsène
lupin
arsène
lupin
and
his
lady
friend
but
what
next
you
surely
do
imagine
they
hiding
up
the
chimney
ganimard
rose
to
his
feet
put
his
five
fingers
on
the
sleeve
of
his
superior
coat
and
in
a
hollow
angry
voice
said
where
would
you
have
them
be
chief
they
must
be
somewhere
they
are
beings
of
flesh
and
blood
like
you
and
me
they
ca
vanish
into
thin
air
no
but
they
vanish
for
all
that
where
where
the
house
is
surrounded
there
are
men
on
the
roof
what
about
the
next
house
there
no
communication
the
flats
on
the
other
floors
i
know
all
the
tenants
they
have
seen
nobody
they
have
heard
nobody
are
you
sure
you
know
them
all
every
one
the
porter
answers
for
them
besides
as
an
additional
precaution
i
have
posted
a
man
in
each
flat
we
must
find
them
you
know
that
what
i
say
chief
that
what
i
say
we
must
and
we
shall
because
they
are
both
here
they
ca
be
anywhere
else
be
easy
chief
if
i
do
catch
them
i
shall
i
shall
spend
the
night
here
i
shall
spend
the
night
here
he
did
in
fact
spend
the
night
there
and
the
next
night
and
the
night
after
that
and
when
three
whole
days
and
three
nights
had
elapsed
not
only
had
he
failed
to
discover
the
elusive
lupin
and
his
no
less
elusive
companion
but
he
had
not
even
observed
the
slightest
clue
upon
which
to
found
the
slightest
supposition
and
that
is
why
he
refused
to
budge
from
his
first
opinion
once
there
no
trace
of
their
flight
they
must
be
here
it
is
possible
that
in
the
depths
of
his
mind
he
was
less
firmly
convinced
but
he
refused
to
admit
as
much
to
himself
no
a
thousand
times
no
a
man
and
a
woman
do
not
vanish
into
space
like
the
wicked
genii
in
the
and
without
losing
courage
he
continued
his
searchings
and
investigations
as
though
he
hoped
to
discover
them
hidden
in
some
impenetrable
retreat
bricked
up
in
the
walls
of
the
house
chapter
ii
the
blue
diamond
in
the
evening
of
the
of
march
old
general
baron
who
had
been
french
ambassador
in
berlin
under
the
second
empire
was
sleeping
comfortably
in
an
in
the
house
which
his
brother
had
left
him
six
months
before
at
avenue
his
lady
companion
continued
to
read
aloud
to
him
while
soeur
auguste
warmed
the
bed
and
prepared
the
as
an
exceptional
case
the
sister
was
returning
to
her
convent
that
evening
to
spend
the
night
with
the
mother
superior
and
at
eleven
she
said
i
finished
now
mlle
antoinette
and
i
going
very
well
sister
and
do
forget
that
the
cook
is
sleeping
out
and
that
you
are
alone
in
the
house
with
the
you
need
have
no
fear
for
monsieur
le
baron
i
shall
sleep
in
the
next
room
as
arranged
and
leave
the
door
open
the
nun
went
away
a
minute
later
charles
the
came
in
for
his
orders
the
baron
had
woke
up
he
replied
himself
just
the
same
as
usual
charles
try
the
electric
bell
to
see
if
it
rings
in
your
bedroom
properly
and
if
you
hear
it
during
the
night
run
down
at
once
and
go
straight
to
the
doctor
are
you
still
anxious
general
i
do
feel
well
i
do
feel
at
all
well
come
mlle
antoinette
where
were
we
in
your
book
are
you
going
to
bed
monsieur
le
baron
no
no
i
do
care
to
go
to
bed
till
very
late
besides
i
can
do
without
help
twenty
minutes
later
the
old
man
dozed
off
again
and
antoinette
moved
away
on
at
that
moment
charles
was
carefully
closing
the
shutters
on
the
ground
floor
as
usual
in
the
kitchen
he
pushed
the
bolt
of
the
door
that
led
to
the
garden
and
in
the
front
hall
he
not
only
locked
the
double
door
but
put
up
the
chain
fastening
the
two
leaves
then
he
went
up
to
his
attic
on
the
third
floor
got
into
bed
and
fell
asleep
perhaps
an
hour
had
elapsed
when
suddenly
he
jumped
out
of
bed
the
bell
was
ringing
it
went
on
for
quite
a
long
time
seven
or
eight
seconds
perhaps
and
in
a
steady
uninterrupted
way
that
all
right
said
charles
recovering
his
wits
some
fresh
whim
of
the
baron
i
suppose
he
huddled
on
his
clothes
ran
down
the
stairs
stopped
before
the
door
and
from
habit
knocked
no
answer
he
entered
the
room
hullo
he
muttered
no
light
what
on
earth
have
they
put
the
light
out
for
and
he
called
in
a
whisper
mademoiselle
no
reply
are
you
there
mademoiselle
what
the
matter
is
monsieur
le
baron
ill
the
same
silence
continued
around
him
a
heavy
silence
that
ended
by
impressing
him
he
took
two
steps
forward
his
foot
knocked
against
a
chair
and
on
touching
it
he
perceived
that
it
was
overturned
and
thereupon
his
hand
came
upon
other
objects
on
the
floor
a
small
table
a
greatly
alarmed
he
went
back
to
the
wall
and
felt
for
the
electric
switch
he
found
it
and
turned
on
the
light
in
the
middle
of
the
room
between
the
table
and
the
wardrobe
lay
the
body
of
his
master
the
baron
what
he
stammered
is
it
possible
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
and
without
moving
with
his
eyes
starting
from
his
head
he
stood
gazing
at
the
general
disorder
of
the
room
the
chairs
upset
a
great
crystal
candlestick
smashed
into
a
thousand
pieces
the
clock
lying
on
the
marble
all
signs
of
a
fierce
and
hideous
struggle
the
handle
of
a
little
steel
dagger
gleamed
near
the
body
the
blade
was
dripping
with
blood
a
handkerchief
stained
with
red
marks
hung
down
from
the
mattress
charles
gave
a
yell
of
horror
the
body
had
suddenly
stretched
itself
in
one
last
effort
and
then
shrunk
up
again
two
or
three
convulsions
and
that
was
all
he
stooped
forward
blood
was
trickling
from
a
tiny
wound
in
the
neck
and
spotting
the
carpet
with
dark
stains
the
face
still
wore
an
expression
of
mad
terror
they
killed
him
he
stammered
they
killed
him
and
he
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
another
probable
crime
was
not
the
companion
sleeping
in
the
next
room
and
would
not
the
baron
murderer
have
killed
her
too
he
pushed
open
the
door
the
room
was
empty
he
concluded
that
either
antoinette
had
been
carried
off
or
that
she
had
gone
before
the
crime
he
returned
to
the
baron
room
and
his
eyes
falling
upon
the
he
observed
that
it
had
not
been
broken
open
more
remarkable
still
he
saw
a
handful
of
louis
on
the
table
beside
the
bunch
of
keys
and
the
pocketbook
which
the
baron
placed
there
every
evening
charles
took
up
the
pocketbook
and
went
through
it
one
of
the
compartments
contained
he
counted
them
there
were
thirteen
notes
of
a
hundred
francs
each
then
the
temptation
became
too
strong
for
him
instinctively
mechanically
while
his
thoughts
did
not
even
take
part
in
the
movement
of
his
hand
he
took
the
thirteen
notes
hid
them
in
his
jacket
rushed
down
the
stairs
drew
the
bolt
unhooked
the
chain
closed
the
door
after
him
and
fled
through
the
garden
charles
was
an
honest
man
at
heart
he
had
no
sooner
pushed
back
the
gate
than
under
the
influence
of
the
fresh
air
with
his
face
cooled
by
the
rain
he
stopped
the
deed
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
appeared
to
him
in
its
true
light
and
struck
him
with
sudden
horror
a
cab
passed
he
hailed
the
driver
hi
mate
go
to
the
and
bring
back
the
commissary
gallop
there
murder
been
done
the
driver
whipped
up
his
horse
but
when
charles
tried
to
go
in
again
he
could
not
he
had
closed
the
gate
himself
and
the
gate
could
not
be
opened
from
the
outside
on
the
other
hand
it
was
of
no
use
ringing
for
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
he
therefore
walked
up
and
down
along
the
gardens
which
at
the
la
muette
end
line
the
avenue
with
a
pleasant
border
of
trim
green
shrubs
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
waited
for
nearly
an
hour
that
he
was
at
last
able
to
tell
the
commissary
the
details
of
the
crime
and
hand
him
the
thirteen
during
this
time
a
locksmith
was
sent
for
who
with
great
difficulty
succeeded
in
forcing
the
gate
of
the
garden
and
the
front
door
the
commissary
went
upstairs
and
at
once
at
the
first
glance
said
to
the
servant
why
you
told
me
that
the
room
was
in
the
greatest
disorder
he
turned
round
charles
seemed
pinned
to
the
threshold
hypnotized
all
the
furniture
had
resumed
its
usual
place
the
little
table
was
standing
between
the
two
windows
the
chairs
were
on
their
legs
and
the
clock
in
the
middle
of
the
the
shivers
of
the
smashed
candlestick
had
disappeared
gaping
with
stupor
he
articulated
the
body
monsieur
le
baron
yes
cried
the
commissary
where
is
the
victim
he
walked
up
to
the
bed
under
a
large
sheet
which
he
drew
aside
lay
general
the
baron
late
french
ambassador
in
berlin
his
body
was
covered
with
his
general
cloak
decorated
with
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honour
the
face
was
calm
the
eyes
were
closed
the
servant
stammered
someone
must
have
come
which
way
i
ca
say
but
someone
has
been
here
during
my
absence
look
there
was
a
very
thin
steel
dagger
there
on
the
floor
and
then
on
the
table
a
handkerchief
that
all
gone
taken
everything
away
they
arranged
everything
but
who
the
murderer
we
found
all
the
doors
closed
he
must
have
remained
in
the
house
then
he
would
be
here
still
as
you
never
left
the
pavement
the
man
reflected
and
said
slowly
that
so
that
so
and
i
did
not
go
far
from
the
gate
either
still
let
us
see
who
was
the
last
person
you
saw
with
the
baron
mlle
antoinette
the
companion
what
has
become
of
her
i
should
say
that
as
her
bed
was
not
even
touched
she
must
have
taken
advantage
of
soeur
auguste
absence
to
go
out
also
it
would
only
half
surprise
me
if
she
had
she
is
young
and
pretty
but
how
could
she
have
got
out
through
the
door
you
pushed
the
bolt
and
fastened
the
chain
a
good
deal
later
by
that
time
she
must
have
left
the
house
and
the
crime
was
committed
you
think
after
she
went
of
course
they
searched
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
from
the
garrets
to
the
cellars
but
the
murderer
had
fled
how
when
was
it
he
or
an
accomplice
who
had
thought
proper
to
return
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
do
away
with
anything
that
might
have
betrayed
him
those
were
the
questions
that
suggested
themselves
to
the
police
the
divisional
surgeon
came
upon
the
scene
at
seven
the
head
of
the
at
eight
next
came
the
turn
of
the
public
prosecutor
and
the
examining
magistrate
in
addition
the
house
was
filled
with
policemen
inspectors
journalists
baron
nephew
and
other
members
of
the
family
they
rummaged
about
they
studied
the
position
of
the
body
according
to
charles
recollection
they
questioned
soeur
auguste
the
moment
she
arrived
they
discovered
nothing
at
most
soeur
auguste
was
surprised
at
the
disappearance
of
antoinette
bréhat
she
had
engaged
the
girl
twelve
days
before
on
the
strength
of
excellent
references
and
refused
to
believe
that
she
could
have
abandoned
the
sick
man
confided
to
her
care
to
go
running
about
at
night
alone
all
the
more
so
the
examining
magistrate
insisted
as
in
that
case
she
would
have
been
in
before
now
we
therefore
come
back
to
the
same
point
what
has
become
of
her
if
you
ask
me
said
charles
she
has
been
carried
off
by
the
murderer
the
suggestion
was
plausible
enough
and
fitted
in
with
certain
details
the
head
of
the
detective
service
said
carried
off
upon
my
word
it
quite
likely
it
not
only
unlikely
said
a
voice
but
absolutely
opposed
to
the
facts
to
the
results
of
the
investigation
in
short
to
the
evidence
itself
the
voice
was
harsh
the
accent
gruff
and
no
one
was
surprised
to
recognize
ganimard
he
alone
besides
would
be
forgiven
that
rather
free
and
easy
way
of
expressing
himself
hullo
is
that
you
ganimard
cried
dudouis
i
had
seen
you
i
have
been
here
for
two
hours
so
you
do
take
an
interest
in
something
besides
number
series
the
rue
clapeyron
mystery
the
blonde
lady
and
arsène
lupin
hee
hee
grinned
the
old
inspector
i
wo
go
so
far
as
to
declare
that
lupin
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
we
engaged
on
but
let
us
dismiss
the
story
of
the
from
our
minds
until
further
orders
and
look
into
this
matter
ganimard
is
not
one
of
those
mighty
detectives
whose
proceedings
form
a
school
as
it
were
and
whose
names
will
always
remain
inscribed
on
the
judicial
annals
of
europe
he
lacks
the
flashes
of
genius
that
illumine
a
dupin
a
lecoq
or
a
holmlock
shears
but
he
possesses
average
qualities
perspicacity
sagacity
perseverance
and
even
a
certain
amount
of
intuition
his
greatest
merit
lies
in
the
fact
that
he
is
absolutely
independent
of
outside
influences
short
of
a
kind
of
fascination
which
arsène
lupin
wields
over
him
he
works
without
allowing
himself
to
be
biased
or
disturbed
at
any
rate
the
part
which
he
played
that
morning
did
not
lack
brilliancy
and
his
assistance
was
of
the
sort
which
a
magistrate
is
able
to
appreciate
to
start
with
he
began
i
will
ask
charles
here
to
be
very
definite
on
one
point
were
all
the
objects
which
on
the
first
occasion
he
saw
upset
or
disturbed
put
back
on
the
second
exactly
in
their
usual
places
exactly
it
is
obvious
therefore
that
they
can
only
have
been
put
back
by
a
person
to
whom
the
place
of
each
of
those
objects
was
familiar
the
remark
impressed
the
bystanders
ganimard
resumed
another
question
charles
you
were
woke
by
a
ring
who
was
it
according
to
you
that
called
you
monsieur
le
baron
of
course
very
well
but
at
what
moment
do
you
take
it
that
he
rang
after
the
struggle
at
the
moment
of
dying
impossible
because
you
found
him
lying
lifeless
at
a
spot
more
than
four
yards
removed
from
the
then
he
rang
during
the
struggle
impossible
because
the
bell
you
told
us
rang
steadily
without
interruption
and
went
on
for
seven
or
eight
seconds
do
you
think
that
his
assailant
would
have
given
him
time
to
ring
like
that
then
it
was
before
at
the
moment
when
he
was
attacked
impossible
you
told
us
that
between
the
ring
of
the
bell
and
the
instant
when
you
entered
the
room
three
minutes
elapsed
at
most
if
therefore
the
baron
had
rung
before
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
struggle
the
murder
the
dying
agony
and
the
flight
to
have
taken
place
within
that
short
space
of
three
minutes
i
repeat
it
is
impossible
and
yet
said
the
examining
magistrate
some
one
rang
if
it
was
not
the
baron
who
was
it
the
murderer
with
what
object
i
ca
tell
his
object
but
at
least
the
fact
that
he
rang
proves
that
he
must
have
known
that
the
bell
communicated
with
a
servant
bedroom
now
who
could
have
known
this
detail
except
a
person
belonging
to
the
house
the
circle
of
suppositions
was
becoming
narrower
in
a
few
quick
clear
logical
sentences
ganimard
placed
the
question
in
its
true
light
and
as
the
old
inspector
allowed
his
thoughts
to
appear
quite
plainly
it
seemed
only
natural
that
the
examining
magistrate
should
conclude
in
short
in
two
words
you
suspect
antoinette
bréhat
i
do
suspect
her
i
accuse
her
you
accuse
her
of
being
the
accomplice
i
accuse
her
of
killing
general
baron
come
come
and
what
proof
this
handful
of
hair
which
i
found
in
the
victim
right
hand
dug
into
his
flesh
by
the
points
of
his
nails
he
showed
the
hair
it
was
hair
of
a
brilliant
fairness
gleaming
like
so
many
threads
of
gold
and
charles
muttered
that
is
certainly
mlle
antoinette
hair
there
is
no
mistaking
it
and
he
added
besides
there
something
more
i
believe
the
knife
the
one
i
did
see
the
second
time
belonged
to
her
she
used
it
to
cut
the
pages
of
the
books
the
silence
that
followed
was
long
and
painful
as
though
the
crime
increased
in
horror
through
having
been
committed
by
a
woman
the
examining
magistrate
argued
let
us
admit
until
further
information
is
obtained
that
the
baron
was
murdered

we
should
still
have
to
explain
what
way
she
can
have
taken
to
go
out
after
committing
the
crime
to
return
after
charles
departure
and
to
go
out
again
before
the
arrival
of
the
commissary
have
you
any
opinion
on
this
subject
m
ganimard
no
then
ganimard
wore
an
air
of
embarrassment
at
last
he
spoke
not
without
a
visible
effort
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
i
find
in
this
the
same
way
of
setting
to
work
as
in
the
ticket
case
the
same
phenomenon
which
one
might
call
the
faculty
of
disappearance
antoinette
bréhat
appears
and
disappears
in
this
house
as
mysteriously
as
arsène
lupin
made
his
way
into
maître
detinan
and
escaped
from
there
in
the
company
of
the
blonde
lady
which
means
which
means
that
i
can
not
help
thinking
of
these
two
coincidences
which
to
say
the
least
are
very
odd
first
antoinette
bréhat
was
engaged
by
soeur
auguste
twelve
days
ago
that
is
to
say
on
the
day
after
that
on
which
the
blonde
lady
slipped
through
my
fingers
in
the
second
place
the
hair
of
the
blonde
lady
has
precisely
the
same
violent
colouring
the
metallic
brilliancy
with
a
golden
sheen
which
we
find
in
this
so
that
according
to
you
antoinette
bréhat
is
none
other
than
the
blonde
lady
and
lupin
consequently
plotted
both
cases
i
think
so
there
was
a
loud
burst
of
laughter
it
was
the
chief
of
the
indulging
his
merriment
lupin
always
lupin
lupin
is
in
everything
lupin
is
everywhere
he
is
just
where
he
is
said
ganimard
angrily
and
then
he
must
have
his
reasons
for
being
in
any
particular
place
remarked
dudouis
and
in
this
case
his
reasons
seem
to
me
obscure
the
has
not
been
broken
open
nor
the
pocketbook
stolen
there
is
even
gold
left
lying
on
the
table
yes
cried
ganimard
but
what
about
the
famous
diamond
what
diamond
the
blue
diamond
the
celebrated
diamond
which
formed
part
of
the
royal
crown
of
france
and
which
was
presented
by
the
duc
to
léonide
latouche
and
on
her
death
was
bought
by
baron
in
memory
of
the
brilliant
actress
whom
he
had
passionately
loved
this
is
one
of
those
recollections
which
an
old
parisian
like
myself
never
forgets
it
is
obvious
said
the
examining
magistrate
that
if
the
blue
diamond
is
not
found
the
thing
explains
itself
but
where
are
we
to
look
on
monsieur
le
baron
finger
replied
charles
the
blue
diamond
was
never
off
his
left
hand
i
have
looked
at
that
hand
declared
ganimard
going
up
to
the
corpse
and
as
you
can
see
for
yourselves
there
is
only
a
plain
gold
ring
look
inside
the
palm
said
the
servant
ganimard
unfolded
the
clenched
fingers
the
bezel
was
turned
inward
and
contained
within
the
bezel
glittered
the
blue
diamond
the
devil
muttered
ganimard
absolutely
nonplussed
this
is
beyond
me
and
i
hope
that
you
will
now
give
up
suspecting
that
unfortunate
arsène
lupin
said
dudouis
with
a
grin
ganimard
took
his
time
reflected
and
retorted
in
a
sententious
tone
it
is
just
when
a
thing
gets
beyond
me
that
i
suspect
arsène
lupin
most
these
were
the
first
discoveries
effected
by
the
police
on
the
day
following
upon
that
strange
murder
vague
inconsistent
discoveries
to
which
the
subsequent
inquiry
imparted
neither
consistency
nor
certainty
the
movements
of
antoinette
bréhat
remained
as
absolutely
inexplicable
as
those
of
the
blonde
lady
nor
was
any
light
thrown
upon
the
identity
of
that
mysterious
creature
with
the
golden
hair
who
had
killed
baron
without
taking
from
his
finger
the
fabulous
diamond
from
the
royal
crown
of
france
moreover
and
especially
the
curiosity
which
it
inspired
raised
the
murder
above
the
level
of
a
sordid
crime
to
that
of
a
mighty
if
heinous
trespass
the
mystery
of
which
irritated
the
public
mind
baron
heirs
were
obliged
to
benefit
by
this
great
advertisement
they
arranged
an
exhibition
of
the
furniture
and
personal
effects
in
the
avenue
in
the
house
itself
on
the
scene
of
the
crime
prior
to
the
sale
at
the
salle
drouot
the
furniture
was
modern
and
in
indifferent
taste
the
knicknacks
had
no
artistic
value
but
in
the
middle
of
the
bedroom
on
a
stand
covered
with
ruby
velvet
the
ring
with
the
blue
diamond
sparkled
under
a
glass
shade
closely
watched
by
two
detectives
it
was
a
magnificent
diamond
of
enormous
size
and
incomparable
purity
and
of
that
undefined
blue
which
clear
water
takes
from
the
sky
which
it
reflects
the
blue
which
we
can
just
suspect
in
linen
people
admired
it
went
into
raptures
over
it
and
cast
terrified
glances
round
the
victim
room
at
the
spot
where
the
corpse
had
lain
at
the
floor
stripped
of
its
carpet
and
especially
at
the
walls
those
solid
walls
through
which
the
criminal
had
passed
they
felt
to
make
sure
that
the
marble
did
not
swing
on
a
pivot
that
there
was
no
secret
spring
in
the
mouldings
of
the
mirrors
they
pictured
yawning
cavities
tunnels
communicating
with
the
sewers
with
the
catacombs
the
blue
diamond
was
sold
at
the
hôtel
drouot
on
the
thirtieth
of
january
the
was
crammed
and
the
bidding
proceeded
madly
all
paris
the
paris
of
the
first
nights
and
great
public
functions
was
there
all
those
who
buy
and
all
those
who
like
others
to
think
that
they
are
in
a
position
to
buy
stockbrokers
artists
ladies
in
every
class
of
society
two
members
of
the
government
an
italian
tenor
a
king
in
exile
who
in
order
to
reëstablish
his
credit
with
great
and
in
a
resounding
voice
permitted
himself
the
luxury
of
running
up
the
price
to
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
hundred
thousand
francs
his
majesty
was
quite
safe
in
making
the
bid
the
italian
tenor
was
soon
offering
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
an
actress
at
the
français
a
hundred
and
at
two
hundred
thousand
francs
however
the
competition
became
less
brisk
at
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
only
two
bidders
remained
herschmann
the
financial
magnate
known
as
the
king
and
a
wealthy
american
lady
the
comtesse
de
crozon
whose
collection
of
diamonds
and
other
precious
stones
enjoys
a
fame
two
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
two
hundred
and
seventy
thousand
eighty
said
the
auctioneer
with
a
questioning
glance
at
either
competitor
in
turn
two
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
for
madame
no
advance
on
two
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
three
hundred
thousand
muttered
herschmann
a
pause
followed
all
eyes
were
turned
on
the
comtesse
de
crozon
smiling
but
with
a
pallor
that
betrayed
her
excitement
she
stood
leaning
over
the
back
of
the
chair
before
her
in
reality
she
knew
and
everybody
present
knew
that
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
finish
of
the
duel
it
was
logically
and
fatally
bound
to
end
in
favour
of
the
financier
whose
whims
were
served
by
a
fortune
of
over
five
hundred
millions
nevertheless
she
said
three
hundred
and
five
thousand
there
was
a
further
pause
every
glance
was
now
turned
on
the
king
in
expectation
of
the
inevitable
advance
it
was
sure
to
come
in
all
its
brutal
and
crushing
strength
it
did
not
come
herschmann
remained
impassive
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
sheet
of
paper
which
he
held
in
his
right
hand
while
the
other
crumpled
up
the
pieces
of
a
torn
envelope
three
hundred
and
five
thousand
repeated
the
auctioneer
going
going
no
further
bid
no
one
spoke
once
more
going
going
herschmann
did
not
move
a
last
pause
the
hammer
fell
four
hundred
thousand
shouted
herschmann
starting
up
as
though
the
tap
of
the
hammer
had
roused
him
from
his
torpor
too
late
the
diamond
was
sold
herschmann
acquaintances
crowded
round
him
what
had
happened
why
had
he
not
spoken
sooner
he
gave
a
laugh
what
happened
upon
my
word
i
do
know
my
thoughts
wandered
for
a
second
you
do
mean
that
yes
some
one
brought
me
a
letter
and
was
that
enough
to
put
me
off
yes
for
the
moment
ganimard
was
there
he
had
watched
the
sale
of
the
ring
he
went
up
to
one
of
the
porters
did
you
hand
herschmann
a
letter
yes
who
gave
it
you
a
lady
where
is
she
where
is
she
why
sir
there
she
is
the
lady
over
there
in
a
thick
veil
just
going
out
yes
ganimard
rushed
to
the
door
and
saw
the
lady
going
down
the
staircase
he
ran
after
her
a
stream
of
people
stopped
him
at
the
entrance
when
he
came
outside
he
had
lost
sight
of
her
he
went
back
to
the
room
spoke
to
herschmann
introduced
himself
and
asked
him
about
the
letter
herschmann
gave
it
to
him
it
contained
the
following
simple
words
scribbled
in
pencil
and
in
a
handwriting
unknown
to
the
financier
the
blue
diamond
brings
remember
baron
the
tribulations
of
the
blue
diamond
were
not
over
already
famous
through
the
murder
of
baron
and
the
incidents
at
the
hôtel
drouot
it
attained
the
height
of
its
celebrity
six
months
later
in
the
summer
the
precious
jewel
which
the
comtesse
de
crozon
had
been
at
such
pains
to
acquire
was
stolen
let
me
sum
up
this
curious
case
marked
by
so
many
stirring
dramatic
and
exciting
episodes
upon
which
i
am
at
last
permitted
to
throw
some
light
on
the
evening
of
the
tenth
of
august
and
madame
de
crozon
guests
were
gathered
in
the
of
the
magnificent
château
overlooking
the
bay
of
somme
there
was
a
request
for
some
music
the
countess
sat
down
to
the
piano
took
off
her
rings
which
included
baron
and
laid
them
on
a
little
table
that
stood
beside
the
piano
an
hour
later
the
count
went
to
bed
as
did
his
two
cousins
the
and
madame
de
réal
an
intimate
friend
of
the
comtesse
de
crozon
who
remained
behind
with
herr
bleichen
the
austrian
consul
and
his
wife
they
sat
and
talked
and
then
the
countess
turned
down
the
big
lamp
which
stood
on
the
table
at
the
same
moment
herr
bleichen
put
out
the
two
lamps
on
the
piano
there
was
a
second
darkness
and
groping
then
the
consul
lit
a
candle
and
they
all
three
went
to
their
rooms
but
the
instant
the
countess
reached
hers
she
remembered
her
jewels
and
told
her
maid
to
go
and
fetch
them
the
woman
returned
and
placed
them
on
the
madame
de
crozon
did
not
examine
them
but
the
next
morning
she
noticed
that
one
of
the
rings
was
missing
the
ring
with
the
blue
diamond
she
told
her
husband
both
immediately
came
to
the
same
conclusion
the
maid
being
above
suspicion
the
thief
could
be
none
but
herr
bleichen
the
count
informed
the
central
commissary
of
police
at
amiens
who
opened
an
inquiry
and
arranged
discreetly
for
the
house
to
be
constantly
watched
so
as
to
prevent
the
austrian
consul
from
selling
or
sending
away
the
ring
the
château
was
surrounded
by
detectives
night
and
day
a
fortnight
elapsed
without
the
least
incident
then
herr
bleichen
announced
his
intention
of
leaving
on
the
same
day
a
formal
accusation
was
laid
against
him
the
commissary
made
an
official
visit
and
ordered
the
luggage
to
be
examined
in
a
small
bag
of
which
the
consul
always
carried
the
key
they
found
a
flask
containing
and
inside
the
flask
the
ring
bleichen
fainted
her
husband
was
arrested
my
readers
will
remember
the
defense
set
up
by
the
accused
he
was
unable
he
said
to
explain
the
presence
of
the
ring
unless
it
was
there
as
the
result
of
an
act
of
revenge
on
the
part
of
de
crozon
the
count
his
wife
he
declared
and
makes
her
life
a
misery
i
had
a
long
conversation
with
her
and
warmly
urged
her
to
sue
for
a
divorce
the
count
must
have
heard
of
this
and
revenged
himself
by
taking
the
ring
and
slipping
it
into
my
when
i
was
about
to
leave
the
count
and
countess
persisted
in
their
charge
it
was
an
even
choice
between
their
explanation
and
the
consul
both
were
equally
probable
no
new
fact
came
to
weigh
down
either
scale
a
month
of
gossip
of
and
investigations
failed
to
produce
a
single
element
of
certainty
annoyed
by
all
this
worry
and
unable
to
bring
forward
a
definite
proof
of
guilt
to
justify
their
accusation
and
madame
de
crozon
wrote
to
paris
for
a
detective
capable
of
unravelling
the
threads
of
the
skein
the
police
sent
ganimard
for
four
days
the
old
inspector
rummaged
and
hunted
about
strolled
in
the
park
had
long
talks
with
the
maids
the
chauffeur
the
gardeners
the
people
of
the
nearest
and
examined
the
rooms
occupied
by
the
bleichen
couple
the
cousins
and
madame
de
réal
then
one
morning
he
disappeared
without
taking
leave
of
his
hosts
but
a
week
later
they
received
this
telegram
please
meet
me
five
friday
afternoon
at
thé
japonais
rue
ganimard
at
five
to
the
minute
on
the
friday
their
drew
up
in
front
of
rue
the
old
inspector
was
waiting
for
them
on
the
pavement
and
without
a
word
of
explanation
led
them
up
to
the
of
the
thé
japonais
in
one
of
the
rooms
they
found
two
persons
whom
ganimard
introduced
to
them
gerbois
professor
at
versailles
college
whom
you
will
remember
arsène
lupin
robbed
of
half
a
million
léonce
nephew
and
residuary
legatee
of
the
late
baron
the
four
sat
down
a
few
minutes
later
a
fifth
arrived
it
was
the
chief
of
the
dudouis
appeared
to
be
in
a
rather
bad
temper
he
bowed
and
said
well
what
is
it
ganimard
they
gave
me
your
telephone
message
at
headquarters
is
it
serious
very
serious
chief
in
less
than
an
hour
the
last
adventures
in
which
i
have
assisted
will
come
to
an
issue
here
i
considered
that
your
presence
was
indispensable
and
does
this
apply
also
to
the
presence
of
dieuzy
and
folenfant
whom
i
see
below
hanging
round
the
door
yes
chief
and
what
for
is
somebody
to
be
arrested
what
a
melodramatic
display
well
ganimard
say
what
you
have
to
say
ganimard
hesitated
for
a
few
moments
and
then
with
the
evident
intention
of
impressing
his
hearers
said
first
of
all
i
wish
to
state
that
herr
bleichen
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
theft
of
the
ring
oh
said
dudouis
that
a
mere
statement
and
a
serious
one
and
the
count
asked
is
this
discovery
the
only
thing
that
has
come
of
your
exertions
no
sir
two
days
after
the
theft
three
of
your
guests
happened
to
be
at
crécy
in
the
course
of
a
two
of
them
went
on
to
visit
the
famous
battlefield
while
the
third
hurried
to
the
and
sent
off
a
little
parcel
packed
up
and
sealed
according
to
the
regulations
and
insured
to
the
value
of
one
hundred
francs
de
crozon
objected
there
is
nothing
out
of
the
way
in
that
perhaps
you
will
think
it
less
natural
when
i
tell
you
that
instead
of
the
real
name
the
sender
gave
the
name
of
rousseau
and
that
the
addressee
a
beloux
residing
in
paris
changed
his
lodgings
on
the
very
evening
of
the
day
on
which
he
received
the
parcel
that
is
to
say
the
ring
was
it
one
of
my
cousins
by
any
chance
asked
the
count
no
it
was
neither
of
those
gentlemen
then
it
was
mme
de
réal
yes
the
countess
in
amazement
exclaimed
do
you
accuse
my
friend
mme
de
réal
a
simple
question
madame
replied
ganimard
was
mme
de
réal
present
at
the
sale
of
the
blue
diamond
yes
but
in
a
different
part
of
the
room
we
were
not
together
did
she
advise
you
to
buy
the
ring
the
countess
collected
her
memory
yes
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
she
was
the
first
to
mention
it
to
me
i
note
your
answer
madame
said
ganimard
so
it
is
quite
certain
that
it
was
mme
de
réal
who
first
spoke
to
you
of
the
ring
and
advised
you
to
buy
it
still
my
friend
is
incapable
i
beg
your
pardon
i
beg
your
pardon
mme
de
réal
is
only
your
chance
acquaintance
and
not
an
intimate
friend
as
the
newspapers
stated
thus
diverting
suspicion
from
her
you
have
only
known
her
since
last
winter
now
i
can
undertake
to
prove
to
you
that
all
that
she
has
told
you
about
herself
her
past
her
connections
is
absolutely
false
that
mme
blanche
de
réal
did
not
exist
before
she
met
you
and
that
she
has
ceased
to
exist
at
this
present
moment
well
said
dudouis
what
next
what
next
echoed
ganimard
yes
what
next
this
is
all
very
interesting
but
what
has
it
to
do
with
the
case
if
mme
de
réal
took
the
ring
why
was
it
found
in
herr
bleichen
come
ganimard
a
person
who
takes
the
trouble
to
steal
the
blue
diamond
keeps
it
what
have
you
to
answer
to
that
i
nothing
but
mme
de
réal
will
answer
then
she
exists
she
exists
without
existing
in
a
few
words
here
it
is
three
days
ago
reading
the
paper
which
i
read
every
day
i
saw
at
the
head
of
the
list
of
arrivals
at
trouville
beaurivage
mme
de
réal
and
so
on
you
can
imagine
that
i
was
at
trouville
that
same
evening
questioning
the
manager
of
the
beaurivage
according
to
the
description
and
certain
clues
which
i
gathered
this
mme
de
réal
was
indeed
the
person
whom
i
was
looking
for
but
she
had
gone
from
the
hotel
leaving
her
address
in
paris
rue
du
colisée
on
wednesday
i
called
at
that
address
and
learnt
that
there
was
no
madame
de
réal
but
just
a
woman
called
réal
who
lived
on
the
second
floor
followed
the
occupation
of
a
and
was
often
away
only
the
day
before
she
had
come
back
from
a
journey
yesterday
i
rang
at
her
door
and
under
a
false
name
offered
my
services
to
mme
de
réal
as
an
intermediary
to
introduce
her
to
people
who
were
in
a
position
to
buy
valuable
stones
we
made
an
appointment
to
meet
here
for
a
first
transaction
oh
so
you
expect
her
at
five
and
are
you
sure
that
it
is
mme
de
réal
of
the
château
de
crozon
i
have
indisputable
proofs
but
hark
folenfant
signal
a
whistle
had
sounded
ganimard
rose
briskly
we
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
and
madame
de
crozon
go
into
the
next
room
please
you
too
and
you
also
gerbois
the
door
will
remain
open
and
at
the
first
sign
i
will
ask
you
to
intervene
do
you
stay
chief
please
and
if
anyone
else
comes
in
asked
dudouis
no
one
will
this
is
a
new
establishment
and
the
proprietor
who
is
a
friend
of
mine
will
not
let
a
living
soul
come
up
the
stairs
except
the
blonde
lady
the
blonde
lady
what
do
you
mean
the
blonde
lady
herself
chief
the
friend
and
accomplice
of
arsène
lupin
the
mysterious
blonde
lady
against
whom
i
have
positive
proofs
but
against
whom
i
want
over
and
above
those
and
in
your
presence
to
collect
the
evidence
of
all
the
people
whom
she
has
robbed
he
leant
out
of
the
window
she
is
coming
she
has
gone
in
she
ca
escape
now
folenfant
and
dieuzy
are
guarding
the
door
the
blonde
lady
is
ours
chief
we
got
her
almost
at
that
moment
a
woman
appeared
upon
the
threshold
a
tall
thin
woman
with
a
very
pale
face
and
violent
golden
hair
ganimard
was
stifled
by
such
emotion
that
he
stood
dumb
incapable
of
articulating
the
least
word
she
was
there
in
front
of
him
at
his
disposal
what
a
victory
over
arsène
lupin
and
what
a
revenge
and
at
the
same
time
that
victory
seemed
to
him
to
have
been
won
with
such
ease
that
he
wondered
whether
the
blonde
lady
was
not
going
to
slip
through
his
fingers
thanks
to
one
of
those
miracles
which
lupin
was
in
the
habit
of
performing
she
stood
waiting
meanwhile
surprised
at
the
silence
and
looked
around
her
without
disguising
her
uneasiness
she
will
go
she
will
disappear
thought
ganimard
in
dismay
suddenly
he
placed
himself
between
her
and
the
door
she
turned
and
tried
to
go
out
no
no
he
said
why
go
but
monsieur
i
do
understand
your
ways
let
me
pass
there
is
no
reason
for
you
to
go
madame
and
every
reason
on
the
contrary
why
you
should
stay
but
it
no
use
you
are
not
going
turning
very
pale
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
stammered
what
do
you
want
ganimard
triumphed
he
had
got
the
blonde
lady
mastering
himself
he
said
let
me
introduce
the
friend
of
whom
i
spoke
to
you
the
one
who
would
like
to
buy
some
jewels
especially
diamonds
did
you
obtain
the
one
you
promised
me
no
no
i
do
know
i
forget
oh
yes
just
try
someone
you
knew
was
to
bring
you
a
coloured
diamond
like
the
blue
diamond
i
said
laughing
and
you
answered
i
may
have
what
you
want
do
you
remember
she
was
silent
a
little
wristbag
which
she
was
holding
in
her
hand
fell
to
the
ground
she
picked
it
up
quickly
and
pressed
it
to
her
her
fingers
trembled
a
little
come
said
ganimard
i
see
that
you
do
not
trust
us
madame
de
réal
i
will
set
you
a
good
example
and
let
you
see
what
i
have
got
to
show
he
took
a
piece
of
paper
from
his
pocketbook
and
unfolded
it
here
first
of
all
is
some
of
the
hair
of
antoinette
bréhat
torn
out
by
the
baron
and
found
clutched
in
the
dead
man
hand
i
have
seen
mlle
de
gerbois
she
has
most
positively
recognized
the
colour
of
the
hair
of
the
blonde
lady
the
same
colour
as
yours
for
that
matter
exactly
the
same
colour
mme
de
réal
watched
him
with
a
stupid
expression
as
though
she
really
did
not
grasp
the
sense
of
his
words
he
continued
and
now
here
are
two
bottles
of
scent
they
are
empty
it
is
true
and
have
no
labels
but
enough
of
the
scent
still
clings
to
them
to
have
enabled
mlle
gerbois
this
very
morning
to
recognize
the
perfume
of
the
blonde
lady
who
accompanied
her
on
her
fortnight
excursion
now
one
of
these
bottles
comes
from
the
room
which
mme
de
réal
occupied
at
the
château
de
crozon
and
the
other
from
the
room
which
you
occupied
at
the
hôtel
beaurivage
what
are
you
talking
about
the
blonde
lady
the
château
de
crozon
the
inspector
without
replying
spread
four
sheets
of
paper
on
the
table
lastly
he
said
here
on
these
four
sheets
we
have
a
specimen
of
the
handwriting
of
antoinette
bréhat
another
of
the
lady
who
sent
a
note
to
baron
herschmann
during
the
sale
of
the
blue
diamond
another
of
mme
de
réal
at
the
time
of
her
stay
at
crozon
and
the
fourth
your
own
madame
your
name
and
address
given
by
yourself
to
the
of
the
hôtel
beaurivage
at
trouville
now
please
compare
these
four
handwritings
they
are
one
and
the
same
but
you
are
mad
sir
you
are
mad
what
does
all
this
mean
it
means
madame
cried
ganimard
with
a
great
outburst
that
the
blonde
lady
the
friend
and
accomplice
of
arsène
lupin
is
none
other
than
yourself
he
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
next
room
rushed
at
gerbois
shoved
him
along
by
the
shoulders
and
planting
him
in
front
of
mme
réal
gerbois
do
you
recognize
the
person
who
took
away
your
daughter
and
whom
you
saw
at
maître
detinan
no
there
was
a
commotion
of
which
every
one
felt
the
shock
ganimard
staggered
back
no
is
it
possible
come
just
think
i
have
thought
madame
is
fair
like
the
blonde
lady
and
pale
like
her
but
she
does
resemble
her
in
the
least
i
ca
believe
it
a
mistake
like
that
is
inconceivable
do
you
recognize
antoinette
bréhat
i
have
seen
antoinette
bréhat
at
my
uncle
this
is
not
she
and
madame
is
not
mme
de
réal
either
declared
the
comte
de
crozon
this
was
the
finishing
stroke
it
stunned
ganimard
who
stood
motionless
with
hanging
head
and
shifting
eyes
of
all
his
contrivances
nothing
remained
the
whole
edifice
was
tumbling
about
his
shoulders
dudouis
rose
i
must
beg
you
to
forgive
us
madame
there
has
been
a
regrettable
confusion
of
identities
which
i
will
ask
you
to
forget
but
what
i
can
not
well
understand
is
your
agitation
the
strangeness
of
your
manner
since
you
arrived
why
monsieur
i
was
frightened
there
is
over
a
hundred
thousand
francs
worth
of
jewels
in
my
bag
and
your
friend
attitude
was
not
very
reassuring
but
your
continual
absences
surely
my
occupation
demands
them
dudouis
had
no
reply
to
make
he
turned
to
his
subordinate
you
have
made
your
inquiries
with
a
deplorable
want
of
thoroughness
ganimard
and
your
behaviour
toward
madame
just
now
was
uncouth
you
shall
give
me
an
explanation
in
my
office
the
interview
was
over
and
the
chief
of
the
detective
service
was
about
to
take
his
leave
when
a
really
disconcerting
thing
happened
mme
réal
went
up
to
the
inspector
and
said
do
i
understand
your
name
to
be
m
ganimard
did
i
catch
the
name
right
yes
in
that
case
this
letter
must
be
for
you
i
received
it
this
morning
addressed
as
you
see
justin
ganimard
care
of
mme
réal
i
thought
it
was
a
joke
as
i
did
not
know
you
under
that
name
but
i
have
no
doubt
the
writer
whoever
he
is
knew
of
your
appointment
by
a
singular
intuition
justin
ganimard
was
very
nearly
seizing
the
letter
and
destroying
it
he
dared
not
do
so
however
before
his
superior
and
he
tore
open
the
envelope
the
letter
contained
the
following
words
which
he
uttered
in
a
hardly
intelligible
voice
there
was
once
a
blonde
lady
a
lupin
and
a
ganimard
now
the
naughty
ganimard
wanted
to
harm
the
pretty
blonde
lady
and
the
good
lupin
did
not
wish
it
so
the
good
lupin
who
was
anxious
for
the
blonde
lady
to
become
friends
with
the
comtesse
de
crozon
made
her
take
the
name
of
mme
de
réal
which
is
the
same
or
nearly
as
that
of
an
honest
tradeswoman
whose
hair
is
golden
and
her
features
pale
and
the
good
lupin
said
to
himself
ever
the
naughty
ganimard
is
on
the
track
of
the
blonde
lady
how
useful
it
will
be
for
me
to
shunt
him
on
to
the
track
of
the
honest
tradeswoman
a
wise
precaution
which
has
borne
fruit
a
little
note
sent
to
the
naughty
newspaper
a
bottle
of
scent
forgotten
on
purpose
at
the
hôtel
beaurivage
by
the
real
blonde
lady
mme
réal
name
and
address
written
by
the
real
blonde
lady
in
the
visitors
book
at
the
hotel
and
the
trick
is
done
what
do
you
say
to
it
ganimard
i
wanted
to
tell
you
the
story
in
detail
knowing
that
with
your
sense
of
humour
you
would
be
the
first
to
laugh
at
it
it
is
indeed
a
pretty
story
and
i
confess
that
for
my
part
it
has
diverted
me
vastly
my
best
thanks
to
you
then
my
dear
friend
and
kind
regards
to
that
capital
dudouis
arsène
lupin
but
he
knows
everything
moaned
ganimard
who
did
not
think
of
laughing
he
knows
things
that
i
have
not
told
to
a
soul
how
could
he
know
that
i
would
ask
you
to
come
chief
how
could
he
know
that
i
had
discovered
the
first
how
could
he
know
he
stamped
about
tore
his
hair
a
prey
to
the
most
tragic
distress
dudouis
took
pity
on
him
come
ganimard
console
yourself
we
must
try
to
do
better
next
time
and
the
chief
detective
went
away
accompanied
by
mme
réal
ten
minutes
elapsed
while
ganimard
read
lupin
letter
over
and
over
again
and
and
mme
de
crozon
and
gerbois
sustained
an
animated
conversation
in
a
corner
at
last
the
count
crossed
over
to
the
inspector
and
said
the
upshot
of
all
this
my
dear
sir
is
that
we
are
no
further
than
we
were
pardon
me
my
inquiry
has
established
the
fact
that
the
blonde
lady
is
the
undoubted
heroine
of
these
adventures
and
that
lupin
is
directing
her
that
is
a
huge
step
forward
and
not
the
smallest
use
to
us
if
anything
it
makes
the
mystery
darker
still
the
blonde
lady
commits
murder
to
steal
the
blue
diamond
and
does
not
steal
it
she
steals
it
and
does
so
to
get
rid
of
it
for
another
benefit
what
can
i
do
nothing
but
some
one
else
might
what
do
you
mean
the
count
hesitated
but
the
countess
said
point
blank
there
is
one
man
one
man
only
in
my
opinion
besides
yourself
who
would
be
capable
of
fighting
lupin
and
reducing
him
to
cry
for
mercy
ganimard
would
you
very
much
mind
if
we
called
in
the
assistance
of
holmlock
shears
he
was
taken
aback
no
no
only
i
do
exactly
understand
well
it
like
this
all
this
mystery
is
making
me
quite
ill
i
want
to
know
where
i
am
gerbois
and
have
the
same
wish
and
we
have
come
to
an
agreement
to
apply
to
the
famous
english
detective
you
are
right
madame
said
the
inspector
with
a
loyalty
that
did
him
credit
you
are
right
old
ganimard
is
not
clever
enough
to
fight
against
arsène
lupin
the
question
is
will
holmlock
shears
be
more
successful
i
hope
so
for
i
have
the
greatest
admiration
for
him
still
it
hardly
likely
it
hardly
likely
that
he
will
succeed
that
what
i
think
i
consider
that
a
duel
between
holmlock
shears
and
arsène
lupin
can
only
end
in
one
way
the
englishman
will
be
beaten
in
any
case
can
he
rely
on
you
certainly
madame
i
will
assist
him
to
the
very
best
of
my
power
do
you
know
his
address
yes
parker
street
that
evening
the
comte
and
comtesse
de
crozon
withdrew
the
charge
against
herr
bleichen
and
a
collective
letter
was
addressed
to
holmlock
shears
chapter
iii
holmlock
shears
opens
hostilities
what
can
i
get
you
gentlemen
anything
you
please
replied
arsène
lupin
in
the
voice
of
a
man
who
takes
no
interest
in
his
food
anything
you
please
but
no
meat
or
wine
the
waiter
walked
away
with
a
scornful
air
i
exclaimed
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
are
still
a
vegetarian
yes
more
than
ever
said
lupin
from
taste
conviction
habit
for
reasons
of
health
and
do
you
never
break
your
rule
oh
yes
when
i
go
out
to
dinner
so
as
not
to
appear
eccentric
we
were
dining
near
the
gare
du
nord
inside
a
little
restaurant
where
arsène
lupin
had
invited
me
to
join
him
he
is
rather
fond
of
telegraphing
to
me
occasionally
in
the
morning
and
arranging
a
meeting
of
this
kind
in
some
corner
or
other
of
paris
he
always
arrives
in
the
highest
spirits
rejoicing
in
life
unaffectedly
and
and
always
has
some
surprising
anecdote
to
tell
me
some
memory
the
story
of
some
adventure
that
i
have
not
heard
before
that
evening
he
seemed
to
me
to
let
himself
go
even
more
than
usual
he
laughed
and
chatted
with
a
singular
animation
and
with
that
delicate
irony
which
is
all
his
own
an
irony
devoid
of
bitterness
light
and
spontaneous
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
him
like
that
and
i
could
not
help
expressing
my
satisfaction
oh
yes
he
cried
i
have
days
when
everything
seems
delightful
when
life
bubbles
in
me
like
an
infinite
treasure
which
i
can
never
exhaust
and
yet
goodness
knows
that
i
live
without
counting
too
much
so
perhaps
the
treasure
is
infinite
i
tell
you
i
can
spend
myself
and
squander
myself
i
can
fling
my
strength
and
my
youth
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
and
i
am
only
making
room
for
greater
and
more
youthful
strength
and
then
really
my
life
is
so
beautiful
i
need
only
have
the
wish
is
it
so
to
become
from
one
day
to
the
next
anything
an
orator
a
great
manufacturer
a
politician
well
i
swear
to
you
the
idea
would
never
enter
my
head
arsène
lupin
i
am
arsène
lupin
i
remain
and
i
search
history
in
vain
for
a
destiny
to
compare
with
mine
fuller
more
intense
napoleon
yes
perhaps
but
then
it
is
napoleon
at
the
end
of
his
imperial
career
during
the
campaign
in
france
when
europe
was
crushing
him
and
when
he
was
wondering
whether
each
battle
was
not
the
last
which
he
would
fight
was
he
serious
was
he
jesting
the
tone
of
his
voice
had
grown
more
eager
and
he
continued
everything
there
you
see
danger
the
uninterrupted
impression
of
danger
oh
to
breathe
it
like
the
air
one
breathes
to
feel
it
around
one
blowing
roaring
lying
in
wait
approaching
and
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
to
remain
calm
not
to
flinch
if
you
do
you
are
lost
there
is
only
one
sensation
to
equal
it
that
of
the
chauffeur
driving
his
car
but
that
drive
lasts
for
a
morning
whereas
mine
lasts
all
through
life
how
lyrical
we
are
i
cried
and
you
would
have
me
believe
that
you
have
no
special
reason
for
excitement
he
smiled
you
a
shrewd
enough
psychologist
he
replied
there
is
something
more
as
you
say
he
poured
out
a
tumbler
of
water
drank
it
down
and
asked
have
you
seen
the
no
holmlock
shears
was
to
have
crossed
the
channel
this
afternoon
he
arrived
in
paris
at
six
the
devil
he
did
and
why
he
taking
a
little
trip
at
the
expense
of
the
crozons
nephew
and
the
gerbois
fellow
they
all
met
at
the
gare
du
nord
and
went
on
to
see
ganimard
the
six
of
them
are
in
conference
at
this
moment
notwithstanding
the
immense
curiosity
with
which
he
inspires
me
i
never
venture
to
question
arsène
lupin
as
to
the
acts
of
his
private
life
until
he
has
spoken
of
them
to
me
himself
it
is
a
matter
of
discretion
on
my
part
with
which
i
never
compound
besides
at
that
time
his
name
had
not
yet
been
mentioned
at
least
not
publicly
in
connection
with
the
blue
diamond
i
waited
patiently
therefore
he
continued
the
also
prints
an
interview
with
that
excellent
ganimard
according
to
which
a
certain
blonde
lady
said
to
be
my
friend
is
supposed
to
have
murdered
baron
and
tried
to
steal
his
famous
ring
from
madame
de
crozon
and
it
goes
without
saying
that
he
accuses
me
of
being
the
instigator
of
both
these
crimes
a
slight
shiver
passed
through
me
could
it
be
true
was
i
to
believe
that
the
habit
of
theft
his
mode
of
life
the
sheer
logic
of
events
had
driven
this
man
to
murder
i
looked
at
him
he
seemed
so
calm
his
eyes
met
mine
so
frankly
i
examined
his
hands
they
were
modelled
with
infinite
daintiness
were
really
inoffensive
hands
the
hands
of
an
artist
ganimard
is
a
lunatic
i
muttered
he
protested
not
a
bit
of
it
not
a
bit
of
it
ganimard
is
shrewd
enough
sometimes
he
even
yes
yes
for
instance
this
interview
is
a
masterstroke
first
he
announces
the
coming
of
his
english
rival
so
as
to
put
me
on
my
guard
and
make
shears
task
more
difficult
secondly
he
specifies
the
exact
point
to
which
he
has
carried
the
case
so
that
shears
may
enjoy
only
the
benefit
of
his
own
discoveries
that
fair
fighting
still
you
have
two
adversaries
to
deal
with
now
and
such
adversaries
oh
one
of
them
does
count
and
the
other
shears
oh
i
admit
that
he
more
of
a
match
for
me
but
that
just
what
i
love
and
why
you
see
me
in
such
good
spirits
to
begin
with
there
the
question
of
my
vanity
they
consider
that
i
worth
asking
the
famous
englishman
to
meet
next
think
of
the
pleasure
which
a
fighter
like
myself
must
take
in
the
prospect
of
a
duel
with
holmlock
shears
well
i
shall
have
to
exert
myself
to
the
utmost
for
i
know
the
fellow
he
wo
retreat
a
step
he
a
clever
man
a
very
clever
man
as
a
detective
i
doubt
if
his
equal
exists
or
has
ever
existed
only
i
have
one
advantage
over
him
which
is
that
attacking
while
i
on
the
defensive
mine
is
the
easier
game
to
play
besides
he
gave
an
imperceptible
smile
before
completing
his
phrase
besides
i
know
his
way
of
fighting
and
he
does
not
know
mine
and
i
have
a
few
sly
thrusts
in
store
for
him
which
will
give
him
something
to
think
about
he
tapped
the
table
lightly
with
his
fingers
and
flung
out
little
sentences
with
a
delighted
air
arsène
lupin
versus
holmlock
shears
france
versus
england
revenge
for
trafalgar
at
last
ah
the
poor
wretch
he
little
thinks
that
i
am
prepared
and
a
lupin
armed
he
stopped
suddenly
seized
with
a
fit
of
coughing
and
hid
his
face
in
his
napkin
as
though
something
had
gone
down
the
wrong
way
what
is
it
i
asked
a
crumb
why
do
you
take
some
water
no
it
not
that
he
gasped
what
then
i
want
air
shall
i
open
the
window
no
i
shall
go
out
quick
give
me
my
hat
and
coat
i
off
but
what
does
it
all
mean
you
see
the
taller
of
those
two
men
who
have
just
come
in
well
i
want
you
to
keep
on
my
left
as
we
go
out
to
prevent
his
seeing
me
the
one
sitting
behind
you
yes
for
personal
reasons
i
prefer
i
tell
you
why
outside
but
who
is
it
holmlock
shears
he
made
a
violent
effort
to
overcome
his
agitation
as
though
he
felt
ashamed
of
it
put
down
his
napkin
drank
a
glass
of
water
and
then
quite
recovered
said
with
a
smile
it
funny
is
it
i
not
easily
excited
but
this
unexpected
meeting
what
are
you
afraid
of
seeing
that
no
one
can
recognize
you
under
all
your
transformations
i
myself
each
time
i
see
you
feel
as
if
i
were
with
a
new
person
will
recognize
me
said
arsène
lupin
saw
me
only
once
but
i
felt
that
he
saw
me
for
life
and
that
what
he
saw
was
not
my
appearance
which
i
can
always
alter
but
the
very
being
that
i
am
and
then
and
then
i
was
prepared
what
a
curious
meeting
in
this
little
restaurant
well
said
i
shall
we
go
no
no
what
do
you
propose
to
do
the
best
thing
will
be
to
act
frankly
to
trust
him
you
ca
be
serious
oh
but
i
am
besides
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
question
him
to
know
what
he
knows
ah
there
i
feel
that
his
eyes
are
fixed
on
my
neck
on
my
shoulders
he
trying
to
think
to
remember
he
reflected
i
noticed
a
mischievous
smile
on
his
lips
and
then
obeying
i
believe
some
whim
of
his
frivolous
nature
rather
than
the
needs
of
the
position
itself
he
rose
abruptly
spun
round
on
his
heels
and
with
a
bow
said
gaily
what
a
stroke
of
luck
who
would
have
thought
it
allow
me
to
introduce
my
friend
for
a
second
or
two
the
englishman
was
taken
aback
then
he
made
an
instinctive
movement
as
though
he
were
ready
to
fling
himself
upon
arsène
lupin
lupin
shook
his
head
that
would
be
a
mistake
to
say
nothing
of
the
bad
taste
of
it
and
the
uselessness
the
englishman
turned
his
head
from
side
to
side
as
though
looking
for
assistance
that
no
better
and
also
are
you
quite
sure
that
you
are
entitled
to
lay
hands
upon
me
come
be
a
sportsman
the
display
of
sportsmanlike
qualities
was
not
particularly
tempting
on
this
occasion
nevertheless
it
probably
appeared
to
shears
to
be
the
wisest
course
for
he
half
rose
and
coldly
introduced
his
companion
wilson
my
friend
and
assistant
arsène
lupin
wilson
stupefaction
made
us
all
laugh
his
eyes
and
mouth
both
wide
open
drew
two
streaks
across
his
expansive
face
with
its
skin
gleaming
and
like
an
apple
while
his
bristly
hair
stood
up
like
so
many
hardy
blades
of
grass
wilson
you
do
seem
able
to
conceal
your
bewilderment
at
one
of
the
most
natural
incidents
in
the
world
grinned
holmlock
shears
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
in
his
voice
wilson
stammered
why
why
do
you
arrest
him
do
you
see
wilson
that
the
gentleman
is
standing
between
the
door
and
myself
and
at
two
steps
from
the
door
before
i
moved
a
finger
he
would
be
outside
do
let
that
stand
in
your
way
said
lupin
he
walked
round
the
table
and
sat
down
so
that
the
englishman
was
between
him
and
the
door
thus
placing
himself
at
his
mercy
wilson
looked
at
shears
to
see
if
he
might
admire
this
piece
of
pluck
shears
remained
impenetrable
but
after
a
moment
he
called
waiter
the
waiter
came
up
four
whiskeys
and
sodas
peace
was
signed
until
further
orders
soon
after
seated
all
four
round
one
table
we
were
quietly
chatting
footnote
see
seven
of
by
maurice
leblanc
chapter
ix
shears
arrives
too
holmlock
shears
is
a
man
of
the
sort
one
meets
every
day
he
is
about
fifty
years
of
age
and
looks
like
a
decent
city
clerk
who
has
spent
his
life
keeping
books
at
a
desk
he
has
nothing
to
distinguish
him
from
the
ordinary
respectable
londoner
with
his
face
and
his
somewhat
heavy
appearance
nothing
except
his
terribly
keen
bright
penetrating
eyes
and
then
of
course
he
is
holmlock
shears
that
is
to
say
a
sort
of
miracle
of
intuition
of
insight
of
perspicacity
of
shrewdness
it
is
as
though
nature
had
amused
herself
by
taking
the
two
most
extraordinary
types
of
detective
that
fiction
had
invented
poe
dupin
and
lecoq
in
order
to
build
up
one
in
her
own
fashion
more
extraordinary
yet
and
more
unreal
and
upon
my
word
any
one
hearing
of
the
adventures
which
have
made
the
name
of
holmlock
shears
famous
all
over
the
world
must
feel
inclined
to
ask
if
he
is
not
a
legendary
person
a
hero
who
has
stepped
straight
from
the
brain
of
some
great
of
a
conan
doyle
for
instance
he
at
once
when
arsène
lupin
asked
him
how
long
he
meant
to
stay
led
the
conversation
into
its
right
channel
and
replied
that
depends
upon
yourself
m
lupin
oh
exclaimed
the
other
laughing
if
it
depended
on
me
i
should
ask
you
to
take
boat
back
is
rather
early
but
i
hope
in
a
week
or
ten
days
are
you
in
such
a
hurry
i
am
very
busy
there
the
robbery
at
the
bank
and
lady
eccleston
has
been
kidnapped
as
you
know
tell
me
lupin
do
you
think
a
week
will
do
amply
if
you
confine
yourself
to
the
two
cases
connected
with
the
blue
diamond
it
will
just
give
me
time
to
take
my
precautions
supposing
the
solution
of
those
two
mysteries
to
give
you
certain
advantages
over
me
that
might
endanger
my
safety
yes
said
the
englishman
i
expect
to
have
gained
those
advantages
in
a
week
or
ten
days
and
to
have
me
arrested
on
the
eleventh
on
the
tenth
at
the
very
latest
lupin
reflected
and
shaking
his
head
it
will
be
difficult
it
will
be
difficult
difficult
yes
but
possible
and
therefore
certain
absolutely
certain
said
wilson
as
though
he
himself
had
clearly
perceived
the
long
series
of
operations
which
would
lead
his
friend
to
the
result
announced
holmlock
shears
smiled
wilson
who
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
is
there
to
confirm
what
i
say
and
he
went
on
of
course
i
have
not
all
the
cards
in
my
hands
because
the
case
is
already
a
good
many
months
old
i
have
not
the
factors
the
clues
upon
which
i
am
accustomed
to
base
my
inquiries
such
as
and
said
wilson
with
an
air
of
importance
but
in
addition
to
the
remarkable
conclusions
arrived
at
by
ganimard
i
have
at
my
service
all
the
articles
written
on
the
subject
all
the
evidence
collected
and
consequently
a
few
ideas
of
my
own
regarding
the
mystery
a
few
views
suggested
to
us
either
by
analysis
or
hypothesis
added
wilson
sententiously
would
it
be
indiscreet
said
arsène
lupin
in
the
deferential
tone
which
he
adopted
toward
shears
would
it
be
indiscreet
to
ask
what
general
opinion
you
have
been
able
to
form
it
was
really
most
stimulating
to
see
those
two
men
seated
together
with
their
elbows
on
the
table
arguing
solemnly
and
dispassionately
as
though
they
were
trying
to
solve
a
steep
problem
or
to
come
to
an
agreement
on
some
controversial
point
and
this
was
coupled
with
a
very
delicate
irony
which
both
of
them
as
experts
and
artists
thoroughly
enjoyed
as
for
wilson
he
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
shears
slowly
filled
his
pipe
lit
it
and
said
i
consider
that
this
case
is
infinitely
less
complicated
than
it
appears
at
first
sight
very
much
less
echoed
wilson
faithfully
i
say
the
case
for
in
my
opinion
there
is
but
one
case
the
death
of
baron
the
story
of
the
ring
and
do
let
us
forget
that
the
mystery
of
number
series
are
only
the
different
aspects
of
what
we
may
call
the
puzzle
of
the
blonde
lady
now
in
my
opinion
what
lies
before
me
is
simply
to
discover
the
link
which
connects
these
three
phases
of
the
same
story
the
particular
fact
which
proves
the
uniformity
of
the
three
methods
ganimard
who
is
a
little
superficial
in
his
judgments
sees
this
uniformity
in
the
faculty
of
disappearing
in
the
power
of
coming
and
going
unseen
this
intervention
of
miracles
does
not
satisfy
me
well
well
according
to
me
said
shears
decidedly
the
characteristic
shared
by
the
three
incidents
lies
in
your
manifest
and
evident
although
hitherto
unperceived
intention
to
have
the
affair
performed
on
a
stage
which
you
have
previously
selected
this
points
to
something
more
than
a
plan
on
your
part
a
necessity
rather
a
quâ
of
success
could
you
give
a
few
particulars
easily
for
instance
from
the
commencement
of
your
contest
with
gerbois
it
was
that
maître
detinan
flat
was
the
place
selected
by
you
the
inevitable
place
at
which
you
were
all
to
meet
no
place
seemed
quite
as
safe
to
you
so
much
so
that
you
made
what
one
might
almost
call
a
public
appointment
there
with
the
blonde
lady
and
mlle
gerbois
the
daughter
of
the
professor
explained
wilson
let
us
now
speak
of
the
blue
diamond
did
you
try
to
get
hold
of
it
during
all
the
years
that
baron
had
it
in
his
possession
no
but
the
baron
moves
into
his
brother
house
six
months
later
antoinette
bréhat
appears
upon
the
scene
and
the
first
attempt
is
made
you
fail
to
secure
the
diamond
and
the
sale
takes
place
amid
great
excitement
at
the
hôtel
drouot
is
the
sale
free
is
the
richest
bidder
sure
of
getting
the
diamond
not
at
all
at
the
moment
when
herschmann
is
about
to
become
the
owner
a
lady
has
a
threatening
letter
thrust
into
his
hand
and
the
diamond
goes
to
the
comtesse
de
crozon
who
has
been
worked
upon
and
influenced
by
the
same
lady
does
it
vanish
at
once
no
you
lack
the
facilities
so
an
interval
ensues
but
the
countess
moves
to
her
this
is
what
you
were
waiting
for
the
ring
disappears
to
reappear
in
the
of
bleichen
the
consul
objected
lupin
how
odd
come
come
said
shears
striking
the
table
with
his
fist
tell
that
to
the
marines
you
can
take
in
fools
with
that
but
not
an
old
fox
like
me
what
do
you
mean
shears
took
his
time
as
though
he
wished
to
save
up
his
effect
then
he
said
the
blue
diamond
found
in
the
is
an
imitation
diamond
the
real
one
you
kept
arsène
lupin
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
englishman
said
very
simply
you
a
great
man
sir
is
he
said
wilson
emphatically
and
gaping
with
admiration
yes
said
lupin
everything
becomes
cleared
up
and
appears
in
its
true
sense
not
one
of
the
examining
magistrates
not
one
of
the
special
reporters
who
have
been
exciting
themselves
about
these
cases
has
come
half
as
near
the
truth
i
look
upon
you
as
a
marvel
of
insight
and
logic
pooh
said
the
englishman
flattered
at
the
compliment
paid
him
by
so
great
an
expert
it
only
needed
a
little
thought
it
needed
to
know
how
to
use
one
thought
and
there
are
so
few
who
do
know
but
now
that
the
field
of
surmise
has
been
narrowed
and
the
ground
swept
clear
well
now
all
that
i
have
to
do
is
to
discover
why
the
three
cases
were
enacted
at
rue
clapeyron
at
avenue
and
within
the
walls
of
the
château
de
crozon
the
whole
case
lies
there
the
rest
is
mere
talk
and
child
play
do
you
agree
i
agree
in
that
case
lupin
am
i
not
right
in
saying
that
i
shall
have
finished
my
business
in
ten
days
in
ten
days
yes
the
whole
truth
will
be
known
and
you
will
be
arrested
no
no
for
me
to
be
arrested
there
would
have
to
be
a
conjunction
of
such
unlikely
circumstances
a
series
of
such
stupefying
pieces
of
that
i
can
not
admit
the
possibility
what
neither
circumstances
nor
luck
may
be
able
to
effect
lupin
can
be
brought
about
by
one
man
will
and
persistence
if
the
will
and
persistence
of
another
man
do
not
oppose
an
invincible
obstacle
to
that
plan
mr
shears
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
invincible
obstacle
m
lupin
the
two
exchanged
a
penetrating
glance
free
from
provocation
on
either
side
but
calm
and
fearless
it
was
the
clash
of
two
swords
about
to
open
the
combat
it
sounded
clear
and
frank
joy
cried
lupin
here
a
man
at
last
an
adversary
is
a
at
any
time
and
this
one
is
holmlock
shears
we
shall
have
some
sport
you
not
afraid
asked
wilson
very
nearly
wilson
said
lupin
rising
and
the
proof
is
that
i
am
going
to
hurry
to
make
good
my
retreat
else
i
might
risk
being
caught
napping
ten
days
we
said
mr
shears
ten
days
this
is
sunday
it
will
all
be
over
by
wednesday
week
and
i
shall
be
under
lock
and
key
without
the
slightest
doubt
by
jove
and
i
was
congratulating
myself
on
my
quiet
life
no
bothers
a
good
steady
little
business
the
police
sent
to
the
right
about
and
a
comforting
sense
of
the
general
sympathy
that
surrounds
me
we
shall
have
to
change
all
this
it
is
the
reverse
of
the
medal
after
sunshine
comes
rain
this
is
no
time
for
laughing
look
sharp
said
wilson
full
of
solicitude
on
behalf
of
a
person
whom
shears
inspired
with
such
obvious
respect
do
lose
a
minute
not
a
minute
wilson
except
to
tell
you
how
pleased
i
have
been
to
meet
you
and
how
i
envy
the
leader
who
has
an
assistant
so
valuable
as
yourself
courteous
bows
were
exchanged
as
between
two
adversaries
on
the
who
bear
each
other
no
hatred
but
who
are
constrained
by
fate
to
fight
to
the
death
and
lupin
took
my
arm
and
dragged
me
outside
what
do
you
say
to
that
old
fellow
there
a
dinner
that
will
be
worth
describing
in
your
memoirs
of
me
he
closed
the
door
of
the
restaurant
and
stopping
a
little
way
off
do
you
smoke
no
but
no
more
do
you
surely
no
more
do
i
he
lit
a
cigarette
with
a
wax
match
which
he
waved
several
times
to
put
it
out
but
he
at
once
flung
away
the
cigarette
ran
across
the
road
and
joined
two
men
who
had
emerged
from
the
shadow
as
though
summoned
by
a
signal
he
talked
to
them
for
a
few
minutes
on
the
opposite
pavement
and
then
returned
to
me
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
shall
have
my
work
cut
out
with
that
confounded
shears
i
swear
however
that
he
has
not
done
with
lupin
yet
by
jupiter
i
show
the
fellow
the
stuff
i
made
of
good
night
the
unspeakable
wilson
is
right
i
have
not
a
minute
to
lose
he
walked
rapidly
away
thus
ended
that
strange
evening
or
at
least
that
part
of
it
with
which
i
had
to
do
for
many
other
incidents
occurred
during
the
hours
that
followed
events
which
the
confidences
of
the
others
who
were
present
at
that
dinner
have
fortunately
enabled
me
to
reconstruct
in
detail
at
the
very
moment
when
lupin
left
me
holmlock
shears
took
out
his
watch
and
rose
in
his
turn
twenty
to
nine
at
nine
i
am
to
meet
the
count
and
countess
at
the
railway
station
let
go
cried
wilson
tossing
off
two
glasses
of
whiskey
in
succession
they
went
out
wilson
do
turn
your
head
we
may
be
followed
if
so
let
us
act
as
though
we
do
care
whether
we
are
or
not
tell
me
wilson
what
your
opinion
why
was
lupin
in
that
restaurant
wilson
without
hesitation
replied
to
get
some
dinner
wilson
the
longer
we
work
together
the
more
clearly
i
perceive
the
constant
progress
you
are
making
upon
my
word
you
becoming
amazing
wilson
blushed
with
satisfaction
in
the
dark
and
shears
resumed
yes
he
went
to
get
some
dinner
and
then
most
likely
to
make
sure
if
i
am
really
going
to
crozon
as
ganimard
says
i
am
in
his
interview
i
shall
leave
therefore
so
as
not
to
disappoint
him
but
as
it
is
a
question
of
gaining
time
upon
him
i
shall
not
leave
ah
said
wilson
nonplussed
i
want
you
old
chap
to
go
down
this
street
take
a
cab
take
two
cabs
three
cabs
come
back
later
to
fetch
the
bags
which
we
left
in
the
cloak
room
and
then
drive
as
fast
as
you
can
to
the
and
what
am
i
to
do
at
the
ask
for
a
room
go
to
bed
sleep
the
sleep
of
the
just
and
await
my
instructions
wilson
proud
of
the
important
task
allotted
to
him
went
off
holmlock
shears
took
his
ticket
at
the
railway
station
and
entered
the
amiens
express
in
which
the
comte
and
comtesse
de
crozon
had
already
taken
their
seats
he
merely
bowed
to
them
lit
a
second
pipe
and
smoked
it
placidly
standing
in
the
corridor
the
train
started
ten
minutes
later
he
came
and
sat
down
beside
the
countess
and
asked
have
you
the
ring
on
you
madame
yes
please
let
me
look
at
it
he
took
it
and
examined
it
as
i
thought
it
is
a
faked
diamond
faked
yes
by
a
new
process
which
consists
in
subjecting
to
enormous
heat
until
it
melts
whereupon
it
is
simply
reformed
into
a
single
diamond
why
but
my
diamond
is
real
yes
yours
but
this
is
not
yours
where
is
mine
then
in
the
hands
of
arsène
lupin
and
this
one
this
one
was
put
in
its
place
and
slipped
into
herr
flask
where
you
found
it
then
it
an
imitation
absolutely
nonplussed
and
overwhelmed
the
countess
said
nothing
more
while
her
husband
refusing
to
believe
the
statement
turned
the
jewel
over
and
over
in
his
fingers
she
finished
by
stammering
out
but
it
impossible
why
did
they
just
simply
take
it
and
how
did
they
get
it
that
just
what
i
mean
to
try
to
discover
at
crozon
no
i
shall
get
out
at
creil
and
return
to
paris
that
where
the
game
between
arsène
lupin
and
myself
must
be
played
out
the
tricks
will
count
the
same
wherever
we
make
them
but
it
is
better
that
lupin
should
think
that
i
am
out
of
town
still
what
difference
can
it
make
to
you
madame
the
main
object
is
your
diamond
is
it
not
yes
well
set
your
mind
at
rest
only
a
little
while
ago
i
gave
an
undertaking
which
will
be
much
more
difficult
to
keep
on
the
word
of
holmlock
shears
you
shall
have
the
real
diamond
back
the
train
slowed
down
he
put
the
imitation
diamond
in
his
pocket
and
opened
the
the
count
cried
take
care
that
the
wrong
side
lupin
will
lose
my
tracks
this
way
if
he
having
me
shadowed
a
porter
protested
the
englishman
made
for
the
office
fifty
minutes
later
he
jumped
into
a
train
which
brought
him
back
to
paris
a
little
before
midnight
he
ran
across
the
station
into
the
refreshment
room
went
out
by
the
other
door
and
sprang
into
a
cab
drive
to
the
rue
clapeyron
after
making
sure
that
he
was
not
being
followed
he
stopped
the
cab
at
the
commencement
of
the
street
and
began
to
make
a
careful
examination
of
the
house
in
which
maître
detinan
lived
and
of
the
two
adjoining
houses
he
paced
off
certain
distances
and
noted
the
measurements
in
his
memorandum
book
now
drive
to
the
avenue
he
dismissed
his
cab
at
the
corner
of
the
avenue
and
the
rue
de
la
pompe
walked
along
the
pavement
to
no
and
went
through
the
same
performance
in
front
of
the
house
which
baron
had
occupied
and
the
two
houses
by
which
it
was
hemmed
in
on
either
side
measuring
the
width
of
their
respective
frontages
and
calculating
the
depth
of
the
little
gardens
in
front
of
the
houses
the
avenue
was
deserted
and
very
dark
under
its
four
rows
of
trees
amid
which
an
occasional
seemed
to
struggle
vainly
against
the
thickness
of
the
gloom
one
of
these
lamps
threw
a
pale
light
upon
a
part
of
the
house
and
shears
saw
the
notice
to
let
hanging
on
the
railings
saw
the
two
neglected
walks
that
encircled
the
miniature
lawn
and
the
great
empty
windows
of
the
uninhabited
house
that
true
he
thought
there
has
been
no
tenant
since
the
death
ah
if
i
could
just
get
in
and
make
a
preliminary
visit
the
idea
no
sooner
passed
through
his
mind
than
he
wanted
to
put
it
into
execution
but
how
to
manage
the
height
of
the
gate
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
climb
it
he
took
an
electric
lantern
from
his
pocket
as
well
as
a
skeleton
key
which
he
always
carried
to
his
great
surprise
he
found
that
one
of
the
doors
of
the
gate
was
standing
ajar
he
therefore
slipped
into
the
garden
taking
care
not
to
close
the
gate
behind
him
he
had
not
gone
three
steps
when
he
stopped
a
glimmer
of
light
had
passed
along
one
of
the
windows
on
the
second
floor
and
the
glimmer
passed
along
a
second
window
and
a
third
while
he
was
able
to
see
nothing
but
a
shadow
outlined
against
the
walls
of
the
rooms
and
the
glimmer
descended
from
the
second
floor
to
the
first
and
for
a
long
time
wandered
from
room
to
room
who
on
earth
can
be
walking
about
at
one
in
the
morning
in
the
house
where
baron
was
murdered
thought
shears
feeling
immensely
interested
there
was
only
one
way
of
finding
out
which
was
to
enter
the
house
himself
he
did
not
hesitate
but
the
man
must
have
seen
him
as
he
crossed
the
belt
of
light
cast
by
the
and
made
his
way
to
the
steps
for
the
glimmer
suddenly
went
out
and
shears
did
not
see
it
again
he
softly
tried
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
steps
it
was
open
also
hearing
no
sound
he
ventured
to
penetrate
the
darkness
felt
for
the
knob
of
the
baluster
found
it
and
went
up
one
floor
the
same
silence
the
same
darkness
continued
to
reign
on
reaching
the
landing
he
entered
one
of
the
rooms
and
went
to
the
window
which
showed
white
in
the
dim
light
of
the
night
outside
through
the
window
he
caught
sight
of
the
man
who
had
doubtless
gone
down
by
another
staircase
and
out
by
another
door
and
was
now
slipping
along
the
shrubs
on
the
left
that
lined
the
wall
separating
the
two
gardens
dash
it
exclaimed
shears
he
escape
me
he
rushed
downstairs
and
leapt
into
the
garden
with
a
view
to
cutting
off
the
man
retreat
at
first
he
saw
no
one
and
it
was
some
seconds
before
he
distinguished
among
the
confused
heap
of
shrubs
a
darker
form
which
was
not
quite
stationary
the
englishman
paused
to
reflect
why
had
the
fellow
not
tried
to
run
away
when
he
could
easily
have
done
so
was
he
staying
there
to
spy
in
his
turn
upon
the
intruder
who
had
disturbed
him
in
his
mysterious
errand
in
any
case
thought
shears
it
is
not
lupin
lupin
would
be
cleverer
it
must
be
one
of
his
gang
long
minutes
passed
shears
stood
motionless
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
adversary
who
was
watching
him
but
as
the
adversary
was
motionless
too
and
as
the
englishman
was
not
the
man
to
hang
about
doing
nothing
he
felt
to
see
if
the
cylinder
of
his
revolver
worked
loosened
his
dagger
in
its
sheath
and
walked
straight
up
to
the
enemy
with
the
cool
daring
and
the
contempt
of
danger
which
make
him
so
formidable
a
sharp
sound
the
man
was
cocking
his
revolver
shears
rushed
into
the
shrubbery
the
other
had
no
time
to
turn
the
englishman
was
upon
him
there
was
a
violent
and
desperate
struggle
amid
which
shears
was
aware
that
the
man
was
making
every
effort
to
draw
his
knife
but
shears
stimulated
by
the
thought
of
his
coming
victory
and
by
the
fierce
longing
to
lay
hold
at
once
of
this
accomplice
of
arsène
lupin
felt
an
irresistible
strength
welling
up
within
himself
he
threw
his
adversary
bore
upon
him
with
all
his
weight
and
holding
him
down
with
his
five
fingers
clutching
at
his
throat
like
so
many
claws
he
felt
for
his
electric
lantern
with
the
hand
that
was
free
pressed
the
button
and
threw
the
light
upon
his
prisoner
face
wilson
he
shouted
in
terror
holmlock
shears
gasped
a
hollow
stifled
voice
they
remained
long
staring
at
each
other
without
exchanging
a
word
dumbfounded
stupefied
the
air
was
torn
by
the
horn
of
a
a
breath
of
wind
rustled
through
the
leaves
and
shears
did
not
stir
his
fingers
still
fixed
in
wilson
throat
which
continued
to
emit
an
ever
fainter
rattle
and
suddenly
shears
overcome
with
rage
let
go
his
friend
but
only
to
seize
him
by
the
shoulders
and
shake
him
frantically
what
are
you
doing
here
answer
me
what
are
you
here
for
who
told
you
to
hide
in
the
shrubbery
and
watch
me
watch
you
groaned
wilson
but
i
did
know
it
was
you
then
what
why
are
you
here
i
told
you
to
go
to
bed
i
did
go
to
bed
i
told
you
to
go
to
sleep
i
did
you
had
no
business
to
wake
up
your
letter
what
letter
the
letter
from
you
which
a
commissionaire
brought
me
at
the
hotel
a
letter
from
me
you
mad
i
assure
you
where
is
the
letter
wilson
produced
a
sheet
of
and
by
the
light
of
his
lantern
shears
read
in
amazement
get
up
at
once
wilson
and
go
to
the
avenue
as
fast
as
you
can
the
house
is
empty
go
in
inspect
it
make
out
an
exact
plan
and
go
back
to
bed
holmlock
shears
i
was
busy
measuring
the
rooms
said
wilson
when
i
saw
a
shadow
in
the
garden
i
had
only
one
idea
to
catch
the
shadow
the
idea
was
excellent
only
look
here
wilson
said
shears
helping
his
friend
up
and
leading
him
away
next
time
you
get
a
letter
from
me
make
sure
first
that
it
not
a
forgery
then
the
letter
was
not
from
you
asked
wilson
who
began
to
have
a
glimmering
of
the
truth
no
worse
luck
who
wrote
it
then
arsène
lupin
but
with
what
object
i
do
know
and
that
just
what
bothers
me
why
the
deuce
should
he
take
the
trouble
to
disturb
your
night
rest
if
it
were
myself
i
could
understand
but
you
i
ca
see
what
interest
i
am
anxious
to
get
back
to
the
hotel
so
am
i
wilson
they
reached
the
gate
wilson
who
was
in
front
took
hold
of
one
of
the
bars
and
pulled
it
hullo
he
said
did
you
shut
it
certainly
not
i
left
the
gate
ajar
but
shears
pulled
in
his
turn
and
then
frantically
flung
himself
upon
the
lock
an
oath
escaped
him
damn
it
all
it
locked
the
gate
locked
he
shook
the
gate
with
all
his
might
but
soon
realizing
the
hopelessness
of
his
exertions
let
his
arms
fall
to
his
sides
in
discouragement
and
jerked
out
i
understand
the
whole
thing
now
it
his
doing
he
foresaw
that
i
should
get
out
at
creil
and
he
laid
a
pretty
little
trap
for
me
in
case
i
should
come
to
start
my
inquiry
in
addition
he
had
the
kindness
to
send
you
to
keep
me
company
in
my
captivity
all
this
to
make
me
lose
a
day
and
also
no
doubt
to
show
me
that
i
would
do
much
better
to
mind
my
own
business
that
is
to
say
that
we
are
his
prisoners
you
speak
like
a
book
holmlock
shears
and
wilson
are
the
prisoners
of
arsène
lupin
the
adventure
is
beginning
splendidly
but
no
no
i
refuse
to
believe
a
hand
touched
his
shoulder
it
was
wilson
hand
look
he
said
up
there
a
light
it
was
true
there
was
a
light
visible
through
one
of
the
windows
on
the
first
floor
they
both
raced
up
each
by
his
own
staircase
and
reached
the
door
of
the
lighted
room
at
the
same
time
a
was
burning
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
beside
it
stood
a
basket
from
which
protruded
the
neck
of
a
bottle
the
legs
of
a
chicken
and
half
a
loaf
of
bread
shears
roared
with
laughter
splendid
he
gives
us
our
supper
it
an
enchanted
palace
a
regular
come
wilson
throw
off
that
dismal
face
this
is
all
very
amusing
are
you
sure
it
very
amusing
moaned
wilson
dolefully
sure
cried
shears
with
a
gaiety
that
was
too
boisterous
to
be
quite
natural
of
course
i
sure
i
never
saw
anything
more
amusing
in
my
life
it
farce
what
a
master
of
chaff
this
arsène
lupin
is
he
tricks
you
but
he
does
it
so
gracefully
i
would
give
my
seat
at
this
banquet
for
all
the
gold
in
the
world
wilson
old
chap
you
disappoint
me
can
i
have
been
mistaken
in
you
are
you
really
deficient
in
that
nobility
of
character
which
makes
a
man
bear
up
under
misfortune
what
have
you
to
complain
of
at
this
moment
you
might
be
lying
with
my
dagger
in
your
throat
or
i
with
yours
in
mine
for
that
was
what
you
were
trying
for
you
faithless
friend
he
succeeded
by
dint
of
humour
and
sarcasm
in
cheering
up
the
wretched
wilson
and
forcing
him
to
swallow
a
leg
of
the
chicken
and
a
glass
of
wine
but
when
the
candle
had
gone
out
and
they
had
to
stretch
themselves
on
the
floor
to
sleep
with
the
wall
for
a
pillow
the
painful
and
ridiculous
side
of
the
situation
became
apparent
to
them
and
their
slumbers
were
sad
in
the
morning
wilson
woke
aching
in
every
bone
and
shivering
with
cold
a
slight
sound
caught
his
ear
holmlock
shears
on
his
knees
bent
in
two
was
examining
grains
of
dust
through
his
lens
and
inspecting
certain
hardly
perceptible
which
formed
figures
which
he
put
down
in
his
escorted
by
wilson
who
seemed
to
take
a
particular
interest
in
this
work
he
studied
each
room
and
found
similar
in
two
of
the
others
he
also
observed
two
circles
on
some
oak
panels
an
arrow
on
a
wainscoting
and
four
figures
on
four
steps
of
the
staircase
after
an
hour
spent
in
this
way
wilson
asked
the
figures
are
correct
are
they
not
i
do
know
if
they
correct
replied
shears
whose
good
temper
had
been
restored
by
these
discoveries
but
at
any
rate
they
mean
something
something
very
obvious
said
wilson
they
represent
the
number
of
planks
in
the
floor
oh
yes
as
for
the
two
circles
they
indicate
that
the
panels
sound
hollow
as
you
can
see
by
trying
and
the
arrow
points
to
show
the
direction
of
the
holmlock
shears
looked
at
him
in
admiration
why
my
dear
chap
how
do
you
know
all
this
your
perspicacity
almost
makes
me
ashamed
of
myself
oh
it
very
simple
said
wilson
bursting
with
delight
i
made
those
marks
myself
last
night
in
consequence
of
your
instructions
or
rather
lupin
instructions
as
the
letter
i
received
from
you
came
from
him
i
have
little
doubt
that
at
that
moment
wilson
was
in
greater
danger
than
during
his
struggle
with
shears
in
the
shrubbery
shears
felt
a
fierce
longing
to
wring
his
neck
mastering
himself
with
an
effort
he
gave
a
grin
that
pretended
to
be
a
smile
and
said
well
done
well
done
that
an
excellent
piece
of
work
most
useful
have
your
wonderful
powers
of
analysis
and
observation
been
exercised
in
any
other
direction
i
may
as
well
make
use
of
the
results
obtained
no
that
all
i
did
what
a
pity
the
start
was
so
promising
well
as
things
are
there
is
nothing
left
for
us
to
do
but
go
go
but
how
the
way
respectable
people
usually
go
through
the
gate
it
locked
we
must
get
it
opened
whom
by
would
you
mind
calling
those
two
policemen
walking
down
the
avenue
but
but
what
it
very
humiliating
what
will
people
say
when
they
learn
that
you
holmlock
shears
and
i
wilson
have
been
locked
up
by
arsène
lupin
it
ca
be
helped
my
dear
fellow
they
will
laugh
like
anything
replied
shears
angrily
with
a
frowning
face
but
we
ca
go
on
living
here
forever
can
we
and
you
do
propose
to
try
anything
not
i
still
the
man
who
brought
the
basket
of
provisions
did
not
cross
the
garden
either
in
coming
or
going
there
must
therefore
be
another
outlet
let
us
look
for
it
instead
of
troubling
the
police
ably
argued
only
you
forget
that
the
whole
police
of
paris
have
been
hunting
for
this
outlet
for
the
past
six
months
and
that
i
myself
while
you
were
asleep
examined
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
ah
my
dear
wilson
arsène
lupin
is
a
sort
of
game
we
are
not
accustomed
to
hunt
he
leaves
nothing
behind
him
you
see
holmlock
shears
and
wilson
were
let
out
at
eleven
and
taken
to
the
nearest
where
the
commissary
after
them
severely
released
them
with
the
most
exasperating
pretences
of
courtesy
gentlemen
i
am
grieved
beyond
measure
at
your
mishap
you
will
have
a
poor
opinion
of
our
french
hospitality
lord
what
a
night
you
must
have
spent
upon
my
word
lupin
might
have
shown
you
more
consideration
they
took
a
cab
to
the
wilson
went
to
the
office
and
asked
for
the
key
of
his
room
the
clerk
looked
through
the
visitors
book
and
replied
in
great
surprise
but
you
gave
up
your
room
this
morning
sir
what
do
you
mean
how
did
i
give
up
my
room
you
sent
us
a
letter
by
your
friend
what
friend
why
the
gentleman
who
brought
us
your
letter
here
it
is
with
your
card
enclosed
wilson
took
the
letter
and
the
enclosure
it
was
certainly
one
of
his
and
the
letter
was
in
his
writing
good
lord
he
muttered
here
another
nasty
trick
and
he
added
anxiously
what
about
the
luggage
why
your
friend
took
it
with
him
oh
so
you
gave
it
to
him
certainly
on
the
authority
of
your
card
just
so
just
so
they
both
went
out
and
wandered
down
the
slowly
and
silently
a
fine
autumn
sun
filled
the
avenue
the
air
was
mild
and
light
at
the
shears
lit
his
pipe
and
resumed
his
walk
wilson
cried
i
ca
understand
you
shears
you
take
it
so
calmly
the
man
laughs
at
you
plays
with
you
as
a
cat
plays
with
a
mouse
and
you
utter
a
word
shears
stopped
and
said
i
thinking
of
your
wilson
well
well
here
is
a
man
who
by
way
of
preparing
for
a
possible
struggle
with
us
obtains
specimens
of
your
handwriting
and
mine
and
has
one
of
your
cards
ready
in
his
pocketbook
have
you
thought
of
the
amount
of
precaution
of
perspicacity
of
determination
of
method
of
organization
that
all
this
represents
you
mean
to
say
i
mean
to
say
wilson
that
to
fight
an
enemy
so
formidably
armed
so
wonderfully
equipped
and
to
beat
him
takes
a
man
like
myself
and
even
then
wilson
he
added
laughing
one
does
not
succeed
at
the
first
attempt
as
you
see
at
six
the
de
published
the
following
paragraph
in
its
special
edition
this
morning
thénard
the
commissary
of
police
of
the
division
released
holmlock
shears
and
wilson
who
had
been
confined
by
order
of
arsène
lupin
in
the
late
baron
house
where
they
spent
an
excellent
night
they
were
also
relieved
of
their
luggage
and
have
laid
an
information
against
arsène
lupin
arsène
lupin
has
been
satisfied
with
giving
them
a
little
lesson
this
time
but
he
earnestly
begs
them
not
to
compel
him
to
adopt
more
serious
measures
pooh
said
holmlock
shears
crumpling
up
the
paper
schoolboy
tricks
that
the
only
fault
i
have
to
find
with
lupin
he
too
childish
too
fond
of
playing
to
the
gallery
he
a
street
arab
at
heart
so
you
continue
to
take
it
calmly
shears
quite
calmly
replied
shears
in
a
voice
shaking
with
rage
the
use
of
being
angry
am
so
certain
of
having
the
last
word
chapter
iv
a
glimmer
in
the
darkness
however
impervious
to
outside
influences
a
man
character
may
be
and
shears
is
one
of
those
men
upon
whom
takes
hardly
any
hold
there
are
yet
circumstances
in
which
the
most
undaunted
feel
the
need
to
collect
their
forces
before
again
facing
the
chances
of
a
battle
i
shall
take
a
holiday
said
shears
and
i
you
wilson
must
go
and
buy
clothes
and
shirts
and
things
to
replenish
our
wardrobe
during
that
time
i
shall
rest
yes
rest
shears
i
shall
watch
wilson
uttered
those
three
words
with
all
the
importance
of
a
sentry
placed
on
outpost
duty
and
therefore
exposed
to
the
worst
dangers
he
threw
out
his
chest
and
stiffened
his
muscles
with
a
sharp
eye
he
glanced
round
the
little
hotel
bedroom
where
they
had
taken
up
their
quarters
that
right
wilson
watch
i
shall
employ
the
interval
in
preparing
a
plan
of
campaign
better
suited
to
the
adversary
whom
we
have
to
deal
with
you
see
wilson
we
were
wrong
about
lupin
we
must
start
again
from
the
beginning
even
earlier
if
we
can
but
have
we
time
nine
days
old
chap
five
days
more
than
we
want
the
englishman
spent
the
whole
afternoon
smoking
and
dozing
he
did
not
begin
operations
until
the
following
morning
i
ready
now
wilson
we
can
go
ahead
let
go
ahead
cried
wilson
full
of
martial
ardour
my
legs
are
twitching
to
start
shears
had
three
long
interviews
first
with
maître
detinan
whose
flat
he
inspected
through
and
through
next
with
suzanne
gerbois
to
whom
he
telegraphed
to
come
and
whom
he
questioned
about
the
blonde
lady
lastly
with
soeur
auguste
who
had
returned
to
the
visitation
convent
after
the
murder
of
baron
at
each
visit
wilson
waited
outside
and
after
each
visit
asked
satisfied
quite
i
was
sure
of
it
we
on
the
right
track
now
let
go
ahead
they
did
a
great
deal
of
going
they
called
at
the
two
mansions
on
either
side
of
the
house
in
the
avenue
from
there
they
went
on
to
the
rue
clapeyron
and
while
he
was
examining
the
front
of
no
shears
continued
it
is
quite
obvious
that
there
are
secret
passages
between
all
these
houses
but
what
i
can
not
make
out
for
the
first
time
and
in
his
inmost
heart
wilson
doubted
the
omnipotence
of
his
talented
chief
why
was
he
talking
so
much
and
doing
so
little
why
cried
shears
replying
to
wilson
unspoken
thoughts
because
with
that
confounded
lupin
one
has
nothing
to
go
upon
one
works
at
random
instead
of
deriving
the
truth
from
exact
facts
one
has
to
get
at
it
by
intuition
and
verify
it
afterward
to
see
if
it
fits
in
but
the
secret
passages
what
then
even
if
i
knew
them
if
i
knew
the
one
which
admitted
lupin
to
his
lawyer
study
or
the
one
taken
by
the
blonde
lady
after
the
murder
of
baron
how
much
further
should
i
be
would
that
give
me
a
weapon
to
go
for
him
with
let
go
for
him
in
any
case
said
wilson
he
had
not
finished
speaking
when
he
jumped
back
with
a
cry
something
had
fallen
at
their
feet
a
bag
with
sand
which
might
have
hurt
them
seriously
shears
looked
up
some
men
were
working
in
a
cradle
hooked
on
to
the
balcony
of
the
fifth
floor
upon
my
word
he
said
we
had
a
lucky
escape
the
clumsy
beggars
another
yard
and
we
should
have
caught
that
bag
on
our
heads
one
would
really
think
he
stopped
darted
into
the
house
rushed
up
the
staircase
rang
the
bell
on
the
fifth
landing
burst
into
the
flat
to
the
great
alarm
of
the
footman
who
opened
the
door
and
went
out
on
the
balcony
there
was
no
one
there
where
are
the
workmen
who
were
here
a
moment
ago
he
asked
the
footman
they
have
just
gone
which
way
why
down
the
servants
staircase
shears
leant
over
he
saw
two
men
leaving
the
house
leading
their
bicycles
they
mounted
and
rode
away
have
they
been
working
on
this
cradle
long
no
only
since
this
morning
they
were
new
men
shears
joined
wilson
down
below
they
went
home
in
a
depressed
mood
and
this
second
day
ended
in
silent
gloom
they
followed
a
similar
programme
on
the
following
day
they
sat
down
on
a
bench
in
the
avenue
wilson
who
was
thoroughly
bored
by
this
interminable
wait
opposite
the
three
houses
felt
driven
to
desperation
what
do
you
expect
shears
to
see
lupin
come
out
no
or
the
blonde
lady
no
what
then
i
expect
some
little
thing
to
happen
some
little
tiny
thing
which
i
can
use
as
a
and
if
nothing
happens
in
that
case
something
will
happen
inside
myself
a
spark
that
will
set
us
going
the
only
incident
that
broke
the
monotony
of
the
morning
was
a
rather
disagreeable
one
a
gentleman
was
coming
down
the
that
separates
the
two
roadways
of
the
avenue
when
his
horse
swerved
struck
the
bench
on
which
they
were
sitting
and
backed
against
shoulder
tut
tut
snarled
shears
a
shade
more
and
i
should
have
had
my
shoulder
smashed
the
rider
was
struggling
with
his
horse
the
englishman
drew
his
revolver
and
took
aim
but
wilson
seized
his
arm
smartly
you
mad
holmlock
why
look
here
you
kill
that
gentleman
let
go
wilson
do
let
go
a
wrestle
ensued
during
which
the
horseman
got
his
mount
under
control
and
galloped
away
now
you
can
fire
exclaimed
wilson
triumphantly
when
the
man
was
at
some
distance
but
you
confounded
fool
do
you
understand
that
that
was
a
confederate
of
arsène
lupin
shears
was
trembling
with
rage
wilson
stammered
piteously
what
do
you
mean
that
gentleman
was
a
confederate
of
lupin
like
the
workmen
who
flung
that
bag
at
our
heads
it
not
credible
credible
or
not
there
was
a
means
handy
of
obtaining
a
proof
by
killing
that
gentleman
by
simply
bringing
down
his
horse
but
for
you
i
should
have
got
one
of
lupin
pals
do
you
see
now
what
a
fool
you
been
the
afternoon
was
passed
in
a
very
sullen
fashion
shears
and
wilson
did
not
exchange
a
word
at
five
as
they
were
pacing
up
and
down
the
rue
clapeyron
taking
care
however
to
keep
away
from
the
houses
three
young
workingmen
came
along
the
pavement
singing
knocked
up
against
them
and
tried
to
continue
their
road
without
separating
shears
who
was
in
a
bad
temper
pushed
them
back
there
was
a
short
scuffle
shears
put
up
his
fists
struck
one
of
the
men
in
the
chest
and
gave
another
a
blow
in
the
face
whereupon
the
men
desisted
and
walked
away
with
the
third
ah
cried
shears
i
feel
all
the
better
for
that
my
nerves
were
a
bit
strained
good
business
but
he
saw
wilson
leaning
against
the
wall
hullo
old
chap
he
said
what
up
you
look
quite
pale
old
chap
pointed
to
his
arm
which
was
hanging
lifeless
by
his
side
and
stammered
i
do
know
my
arm
hurting
me
your
arm
badly
yes
rather
it
my
right
arm
he
tried
to
lift
it
but
could
not
shears
felt
it
gently
at
first
and
then
more
roughly
to
see
exactly
he
said
how
much
it
hurts
it
hurt
exactly
so
much
that
wilson
on
being
led
to
a
neighbouring
chemist
shop
experienced
an
immediate
need
to
fall
into
a
dead
faint
the
chemist
and
his
assistant
did
what
they
could
they
discovered
that
the
arm
was
broken
and
that
it
was
a
case
for
a
surgeon
an
operation
and
a
hospital
meanwhile
the
patient
was
undressed
and
began
to
relieve
his
sufferings
by
roaring
with
pain
that
all
right
that
all
right
said
shears
who
was
holding
wilson
arm
just
a
little
patience
old
chap
in
five
or
six
weeks
you
wo
know
that
you
been
hurt
but
i
make
them
pay
for
it
the
scoundrels
you
understand
i
mean
him
especially
for
it
that
wretched
lupin
who
responsible
for
this
oh
i
swear
to
you
that
if
ever
he
interrupted
himself
suddenly
dropped
the
arm
which
gave
wilson
such
a
shock
of
pain
that
the
poor
wretch
fainted
once
more
and
striking
his
forehead
shouted
wilson
i
have
an
idea
could
it
possibly
he
stood
motionless
with
his
eyes
fixed
before
him
and
muttered
in
short
sentences
yes
that
it
it
all
clear
now
the
explanation
staring
us
in
the
face
why
of
course
i
knew
it
only
needed
a
little
thought
ah
my
dear
wilson
this
will
rejoice
your
heart
and
leaving
old
chap
where
he
was
he
rushed
into
the
street
and
ran
to
no
one
of
the
stones
above
the
door
on
the
right
bore
the
inscription
the
same
inscription
appeared
on
no
so
far
this
was
quite
natural
but
what
would
he
find
down
there
in
the
avenue
he
hailed
a
passing
cab
drive
to
avenue
go
as
fast
as
you
can
standing
up
in
the
cab
he
urged
on
the
horse
promising
the
driver
tip
after
tip
faster
faster
still
he
was
in
an
agony
as
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
pompe
had
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
truth
on
one
of
the
stones
of
the
house
he
read
the
words
and
he
found
the
same
inscription
on
each
of
the
adjoining
blocks
of
flats
the
reaction
after
this
excitement
was
so
great
that
he
sank
back
into
the
cab
for
a
few
minutes
all
trembling
with
delight
at
last
a
tiny
glimmer
flickered
in
the
darkness
amid
the
thousand
intersecting
paths
in
the
great
gloomy
forest
he
had
found
the
first
sign
of
a
trail
followed
by
the
enemy
he
entered
a
and
asked
to
be
put
on
to
the
château
de
crozon
the
countess
herself
answered
hullo
is
that
you
madame
is
that
shears
how
are
things
going
very
well
but
tell
me
quickly
hullo
are
you
there
yes
when
was
the
château
de
crozon
built
it
was
burnt
down
thirty
years
ago
and
rebuilt
by
whom
and
in
what
year
there
an
inscription
over
the
front
door
destange
thank
you
madame
he
went
away
muttering
destange
lucien
destange
i
seem
to
know
the
name
he
found
a
public
library
consulted
a
modern
biographical
dictionary
and
copied
out
the
reference
to
lucien
destange
born
de
rome
officer
of
the
legion
of
honour
author
of
several
valuable
works
on
architecture
etc
he
next
went
to
the
chemist
and
from
there
to
the
hospital
to
which
wilson
had
been
moved
old
chap
was
lying
on
his
bed
of
pain
with
his
arm
in
splints
shivering
with
fever
and
slightly
delirious
victory
victory
cried
shears
i
have
one
end
of
the
clue
what
clue
the
clue
that
will
lead
me
to
success
i
am
now
treading
firm
soil
where
i
shall
find
marks
and
indications
asked
wilson
whom
the
interest
of
the
situation
was
reviving
and
plenty
of
other
things
just
think
wilson
i
have
discovered
the
mysterious
link
that
connects
the
three
adventures
of
the
blonde
lady
why
were
the
three
houses
in
which
the
three
adventures
took
place
selected
by
arsène
lupin
yes
why
because
those
three
houses
wilson
were
built
by
the
same
architect
it
was
easy
to
guess
that
you
say
certainly
it
was
and
that
why
nobody
thought
of
it
nobody
except
yourself
just
so
and
i
now
understand
how
the
same
architect
by
contriving
similar
plans
enabled
three
actions
to
be
performed
which
appeared
to
be
miraculous
though
they
were
really
quite
easy
and
simple
what
luck
it
was
high
time
old
chap
for
i
was
beginning
to
lose
patience
this
is
the
fourth
day
out
of
ten
oh
but
from
now
onward
he
could
no
longer
keep
his
seat
exulting
in
his
gladness
beyond
his
wont
oh
when
i
think
that
just
now
in
the
street
those
ruffians
might
have
broken
my
arm
as
well
as
yours
what
do
you
say
to
that
wilson
wilson
simply
shuddered
at
the
horrid
thought
and
shears
continued
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
us
you
see
wilson
our
great
mistake
has
been
to
fight
lupin
in
the
open
and
to
expose
ourselves
in
the
most
obliging
way
to
his
attacks
the
thing
is
not
as
bad
as
it
might
be
because
he
only
got
at
you
and
i
came
off
with
a
broken
arm
moaned
wilson
whereas
it
might
have
been
both
of
us
but
no
more
swaggering
watched
in
broad
daylight
i
am
beaten
working
freely
in
the
shade
i
have
the
advantage
whatever
the
enemy
strength
may
be
ganimard
might
be
able
to
help
you
never
on
the
day
when
i
can
say
lupin
is
there
that
is
his
this
is
how
you
must
set
to
work
to
catch
him
i
shall
hunt
up
ganimard
at
one
of
the
two
addresses
he
gave
me
his
flat
in
the
rue
pergolèse
or
the
taverne
suisse
on
the
place
du
châtelet
but
till
then
i
shall
act
alone
he
went
up
to
the
bed
put
his
hand
on
wilson
shoulder
the
bad
shoulder
of
course
and
said
in
a
very
affectionate
voice
take
care
of
yourself
old
chap
your
task
henceforth
will
consist
in
keeping
two
or
three
of
lupin
men
busy
they
will
waste
their
time
waiting
for
me
to
come
and
inquire
after
you
it
a
confidential
task
thank
you
ever
so
much
replied
wilson
gratefully
i
shall
do
my
best
to
perform
it
conscientiously
so
you
are
not
coming
back
why
should
i
asked
shears
coldly
no
you
quite
right
you
quite
right
i
going
on
as
well
as
can
be
expected
you
might
do
one
thing
for
me
holmlock
give
me
a
drink
a
drink
yes
i
parched
with
thirst
and
this
fever
of
mine
why
of
course
wait
a
minute
he
fumbled
about
among
some
bottles
came
upon
a
packet
of
tobacco
filled
and
lit
his
pipe
and
suddenly
as
though
he
had
not
even
heard
his
friend
request
walked
away
while
old
chap
cast
longing
glances
at
the
beyond
his
reach
is
destange
at
home
the
butler
eyed
the
person
to
whom
he
had
opened
the
door
of
the
house
the
magnificent
house
at
the
corner
of
the
place
malesherbes
and
the
rue
montchanin
and
at
the
sight
of
the
little
man
whose
long
and
far
from
immaculate
matched
the
oddity
of
a
figure
to
which
nature
had
been
anything
but
kind
replied
with
due
scorn
destange
may
be
at
home
or
he
may
be
out
it
depends
has
monsieur
a
card
monsieur
had
no
card
but
he
carried
a
letter
of
introduction
and
the
butler
had
to
take
it
to
destange
whereupon
destange
ordered
the
newcomer
to
be
shown
in
he
was
ushered
into
a
large
circular
room
which
occupied
one
of
the
wings
of
the
house
and
which
was
lined
with
books
all
round
the
walls
are
you
m
stickmann
asked
the
architect
yes
sir
my
secretary
writes
that
he
is
ill
and
sends
you
to
continue
the
general
catalogue
of
my
books
which
he
began
under
my
direction
and
of
the
german
books
in
particular
have
you
any
experience
of
this
sort
of
work
yes
sir
a
long
experience
replied
stickmann
in
a
strong
teutonic
accent
in
these
conditions
the
matter
was
soon
settled
and
destange
set
to
work
with
his
new
secretary
without
further
delay
holmlock
shears
had
carried
the
citadel
in
order
to
escape
lupin
observation
and
to
obtain
an
entrance
into
the
house
which
lucien
destange
occupied
with
his
daughter
clotilde
the
illustrious
detective
had
been
obliged
to
take
a
leap
in
the
dark
to
resort
to
untold
stratagems
to
win
the
favour
and
confidence
of
a
host
of
people
under
endless
different
names
in
short
to
lead
hours
of
the
most
complex
life
the
particulars
which
he
had
gathered
were
these
destange
who
was
in
failing
health
and
anxious
for
rest
had
retired
from
business
and
was
living
among
the
architectural
books
which
it
had
been
his
hobby
to
collect
he
had
no
interest
left
in
life
beyond
the
handling
and
examining
of
those
old
dusty
volumes
as
for
his
daughter
clotilde
she
was
looked
upon
as
eccentric
she
spent
her
days
like
her
father
in
the
house
but
in
another
part
of
it
and
never
went
out
this
is
all
thought
shears
as
he
wrote
down
the
titles
of
the
books
in
his
catalogue
to
destange
dictation
this
is
all
more
or
less
indefinite
but
it
is
a
good
step
forward
i
am
bound
to
discover
the
solution
of
one
at
least
of
these
exciting
problems
is
destange
an
accomplice
of
arsène
lupin
does
he
see
him
now
are
there
any
papers
relating
to
the
building
of
the
three
houses
will
these
papers
supply
me
with
the
address
of
other
properties
similarly
faked
which
lupin
may
have
reserved
for
his
own
use
and
that
of
his
gang
destange
an
accomplice
of
arsène
lupin
this
venerable
man
an
officer
of
the
legion
of
honour
working
hand
in
hand
with
a
burglar
the
presumption
was
hardly
tenable
besides
supposing
that
they
were
accomplices
how
did
destange
come
to
provide
for
arsène
various
escapes
thirty
years
before
they
occurred
at
a
time
when
arsène
was
in
his
cradle
no
matter
the
englishman
stuck
to
his
guns
with
his
prodigious
intuition
with
that
instinct
which
is
all
his
own
he
felt
a
mystery
surrounding
him
this
was
perceptible
by
small
signs
which
he
could
not
have
described
with
precision
but
which
impressed
him
from
the
moment
when
he
first
set
foot
in
the
house
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
he
had
as
yet
discovered
nothing
of
interest
he
first
saw
clotilde
destange
at
two
when
she
came
to
fetch
a
book
from
the
library
she
was
a
woman
of
thirty
dark
with
slow
and
silent
movements
and
her
features
bore
the
look
of
indifference
of
those
who
live
much
within
themselves
she
exchanged
a
few
words
with
destange
and
left
the
room
without
so
much
as
glancing
at
shears
the
afternoon
dragged
on
monotonously
at
five
destange
stated
that
he
was
going
out
shears
remained
alone
in
the
circular
gallery
that
ran
round
the
library
between
floor
and
ceiling
it
was
growing
dark
and
he
was
preparing
to
leave
in
his
turn
when
he
heard
a
creaking
sound
and
at
the
same
time
felt
that
there
was
some
one
in
the
room
minute
followed
slowly
upon
minute
and
suddenly
he
started
a
shadow
had
emerged
from
the
semidarkness
quite
close
to
him
on
the
balcony
was
it
credible
how
long
had
this
unseen
person
been
keeping
him
company
and
where
did
he
come
from
and
the
man
went
down
the
steps
and
turned
in
the
direction
of
a
large
oak
cupboard
crouching
on
his
knees
behind
the
tapestry
that
covered
the
rail
of
the
gallery
shears
watched
and
saw
the
man
rummage
among
the
papers
with
which
the
cupboard
was
crammed
what
was
he
looking
for
and
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
mlle
destange
entered
quickly
saying
to
some
one
behind
her
so
you
have
quite
changed
your
mind
about
going
out
father
in
that
case
i
turn
on
the
light
wait
a
minute
do
move
the
man
closed
the
doors
of
the
cupboard
and
hid
himself
in
the
embrasure
of
a
broad
window
drawing
the
curtains
in
front
of
him
how
was
it
that
mlle
destange
did
not
see
him
how
was
it
that
she
did
not
hear
him
she
calmly
switched
on
the
electric
light
and
stood
back
for
her
father
to
pass
they
sat
down
side
by
side
mlle
destange
opened
a
book
which
she
had
brought
with
her
and
began
to
read
has
your
secretary
gone
she
said
presently
yes
so
it
seems
are
you
still
satisfied
with
him
she
continued
as
if
in
ignorance
of
the
real
secretary
illness
and
of
the
arrival
of
stickmann
in
his
stead
quite
quite
destange
head
dropped
on
his
chest
he
fell
asleep
a
moment
elapsed
the
girl
went
on
reading
but
one
of
the
window
curtains
was
moved
aside
and
the
man
slipped
along
the
wall
toward
the
door
an
action
which
made
him
pass
behind
destange
but
right
in
front
of
clotilde
and
in
such
a
way
that
shears
was
able
to
see
him
plainly
it
was
arsène
lupin
the
englishman
quivered
with
delight
his
calculations
were
correct
he
had
penetrated
to
the
very
heart
of
the
mystery
and
lupin
was
where
he
had
expected
to
find
him
clotilde
however
did
not
stir
although
it
was
impossible
that
a
single
movement
of
that
man
had
escaped
her
and
lupin
was
close
to
the
door
and
had
his
arm
stretched
toward
the
handle
when
his
clothes
grazed
a
table
and
something
fell
to
the
ground
destange
woke
with
a
start
in
a
moment
arsène
lupin
was
standing
before
him
smiling
hat
in
hand
maxime
bermond
cried
destange
in
delight
my
dear
maxime
what
stroke
of
good
luck
brings
you
here
the
wish
to
see
you
and
mlle
destange
when
did
you
come
back
yesterday
are
you
staying
to
dinner
thank
you
no
i
am
dining
out
with
some
friends
come
then
clotilde
make
him
come
my
dear
maxime
i
was
thinking
of
you
only
the
other
day
really
yes
i
was
arranging
my
old
papers
in
that
cupboard
and
i
came
across
our
last
account
which
one
the
avenue
account
do
you
mean
to
say
you
keep
all
that
waste
paper
what
for
the
three
moved
into
a
little
which
was
connected
with
the
round
library
by
a
wide
recess
is
it
lupin
thought
shears
seized
with
a
sudden
doubt
all
the
evidence
pointed
to
him
but
it
was
another
man
as
well
a
man
who
resembled
arsène
lupin
in
certain
respects
and
who
nevertheless
preserved
his
distinct
individuality
his
own
features
look
and
complexion
dressed
for
the
evening
with
a
white
tie
and
a
shirt
following
the
lines
of
his
body
he
talked
gaily
telling
stories
which
made
destange
laugh
aloud
and
which
brought
a
smile
to
lips
and
each
of
these
smiles
seemed
a
reward
which
arsène
lupin
coveted
and
which
he
rejoiced
at
having
won
his
spirits
and
gaiety
increased
and
imperceptibly
at
the
sound
of
his
clear
and
happy
voice
clotilde
face
brightened
up
and
lost
the
look
of
coldness
that
tended
to
spoil
it
they
are
in
love
thought
shears
but
what
on
earth
can
clotilde
destange
and
maxime
bermond
have
in
common
does
she
know
that
maxime
is
arsène
lupin
he
listened
anxiously
until
seven
making
the
most
of
every
word
spoken
then
with
infinite
precautions
he
came
down
and
crossed
the
side
of
the
room
where
there
was
no
danger
of
his
being
seen
from
the
once
outside
after
assuring
himself
that
there
was
no
or
cab
waiting
he
limped
away
along
the
boulevard
malesherbes
then
he
turned
down
a
side
street
put
on
the
overcoat
which
he
carried
over
his
arm
changed
the
shape
of
his
hat
drew
himself
up
and
thus
transformed
returned
to
the
square
where
he
waited
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
of
the
hôtel
destange
arsène
lupin
came
out
almost
at
once
and
walked
down
the
rue
de
constantinople
and
the
rue
de
londres
toward
the
centre
of
the
town
shears
followed
him
at
a
hundred
yards
distance
it
was
a
delicious
moment
for
the
englishman
he
sniffed
the
air
greedily
like
a
good
hound
scenting
a
fresh
trail
it
really
seemed
infinitely
sweet
to
him
to
be
following
his
adversary
it
was
no
longer
he
that
was
watched
but
arsène
lupin
the
invisible
arsène
lupin
he
kept
him
so
to
speak
fastened
at
the
end
of
his
eyes
as
though
with
unbreakable
bonds
and
he
revelled
in
contemplating
among
the
other
pedestrians
this
prey
which
belonged
to
him
but
a
curious
incident
soon
struck
him
in
the
centre
of
the
space
that
separated
arsène
lupin
and
himself
other
people
were
going
in
the
same
direction
notably
two
tall
fellows
in
bowler
hats
on
the
left
pavement
while
two
others
in
caps
were
following
on
the
right
pavement
smoking
cigarettes
as
they
went
this
might
be
only
a
coincidence
but
shears
was
more
surprised
when
the
four
men
stopped
as
lupin
entered
a
tobacconist
shop
and
still
more
when
they
started
again
as
he
came
out
but
separately
each
keeping
to
his
own
side
of
the
chaussée
confound
it
thought
shears
he
being
shadowed
the
idea
that
others
were
on
arsène
lupin
track
that
others
might
rob
him
not
of
the
glory
he
cared
little
for
that
but
of
the
huge
pleasure
the
intense
delight
of
conquering
unaided
the
most
formidable
enemy
that
he
had
ever
encountered
this
idea
exasperated
him
and
yet
there
was
no
possibility
of
a
mistake
the
men
wore
that
look
of
detachment
that
look
which
distinguishes
persons
who
while
regulating
their
gait
by
another
endeavour
to
remain
unobserved
does
ganimard
know
more
than
he
pretends
muttered
shears
is
he
making
game
of
me
he
felt
inclined
to
accost
one
of
the
four
men
with
a
view
to
acting
in
concert
with
him
but
as
they
approached
the
boulevard
the
crowd
became
denser
he
was
afraid
of
losing
lupin
and
quickened
his
pace
he
turned
into
the
boulevard
just
as
lupin
had
his
foot
on
the
step
of
the
restaurant
hongrois
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
du
helder
the
door
was
open
and
shears
sitting
on
a
bench
on
the
boulevard
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
saw
him
take
his
seat
at
a
table
laid
with
the
greatest
luxury
and
decorated
with
flowers
where
he
was
warmly
welcomed
by
three
men
in
evening
clothes
and
two
ladies
who
had
been
waiting
for
him
shears
looked
for
the
four
rough
fellows
and
saw
them
scattered
among
the
groups
of
people
who
were
listening
to
the
bohemian
band
of
the
neighbouring
café
strange
to
say
they
appeared
to
be
not
nearly
so
much
interested
in
arsène
lupin
as
in
the
people
surrounding
them
suddenly
one
of
them
took
a
cigarette
from
his
case
and
addressed
a
gentleman
in
a
and
tall
hat
the
gentleman
offered
a
light
from
his
cigar
and
shears
received
the
impression
that
they
were
talking
at
greater
length
than
the
mere
lighting
of
a
cigarette
demanded
at
last
the
gentleman
went
up
the
steps
and
glanced
into
the
restaurant
seeing
lupin
he
walked
up
to
him
exchanged
a
few
words
with
him
and
selected
a
table
close
at
hand
and
shears
realized
that
he
was
none
other
than
the
horseman
of
the
avenue
now
he
understood
not
only
was
arsène
not
being
shadowed
but
these
men
were
members
of
his
gang
these
men
were
watching
over
his
safety
they
were
his
bodyguard
his
satellites
his
vigilant
escort
wherever
the
master
ran
any
danger
there
his
accomplices
were
ready
to
warn
him
ready
to
defend
him
the
four
men
were
accomplices
the
gentleman
in
the
was
an
accomplice
a
thrill
passed
through
the
englishman
frame
would
he
ever
succeed
in
laying
hands
on
that
inaccessible
person
the
power
represented
by
an
association
of
this
kind
ruled
by
such
a
chief
seemed
boundless
he
tore
a
leaf
from
his
wrote
a
few
lines
in
pencil
put
the
note
in
an
envelope
and
gave
it
to
a
boy
of
fifteen
who
had
lain
down
on
the
bench
beside
him
here
my
lad
take
a
cab
and
give
this
letter
to
the
young
lady
behind
the
bar
at
the
taverne
suisse
on
the
place
du
châtelet
be
as
quick
as
you
can
he
handed
him
a
piece
the
boy
went
off
half
an
hour
elapsed
the
crowd
had
increased
and
shears
but
occasionally
caught
sight
of
lupin
followers
then
some
one
grazed
against
him
and
a
voice
said
in
his
ear
well
shears
what
can
i
do
for
you
is
that
you
m
ganimard
yes
i
got
your
note
what
is
it
he
there
what
that
you
say
over
there
inside
the
restaurant
move
a
little
to
the
right
do
you
see
him
no
he
is
filling
the
glass
of
the
lady
on
his
left
but
that
not
lupin
yes
it
is
i
assure
you
and
yet
well
it
may
be
oh
the
rascal
like
himself
he
is
muttered
ganimard
innocently
and
who
are
the
others
accomplices
no
the
lady
beside
him
is
lady
cliveden
the
other
is
the
duchess
of
cleath
and
opposite
her
is
the
spanish
ambassador
in
london
ganimard
took
a
step
toward
the
road
but
shears
held
him
back
do
be
so
reckless
you
are
alone
so
is
he
no
there
are
men
on
the
boulevard
mounting
guard
not
to
mention
that
gentleman
inside
the
restaurant
but
i
have
only
to
take
him
by
the
collar
and
shout
his
name
to
have
the
whole
restaurant
on
my
side
all
the
waiters
i
would
rather
have
a
few
detectives
that
would
set
lupin
friends
off
no
shears
we
have
no
choice
you
see
he
was
right
and
shears
felt
it
it
was
better
to
make
the
attempt
and
take
advantage
of
the
exceptional
circumstances
he
contented
himself
with
saying
to
ganimard
do
your
best
not
to
be
recognized
before
you
can
help
it
he
himself
slipped
behind
a
without
losing
sight
of
arsène
lupin
who
was
leaning
over
lady
cliveden
smiling
the
inspector
crossed
the
street
looking
straight
before
him
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
but
the
moment
he
reached
the
opposite
pavement
he
veered
briskly
round
and
sprang
up
the
steps
a
shrill
whistle
sounded
ganimard
knocked
up
against
the
who
suddenly
blocked
the
entrance
and
pushed
him
back
with
indignation
as
he
might
push
back
any
intruder
whose
doubtful
attire
would
have
disgraced
the
luxury
of
the
establishment
ganimard
staggered
at
the
same
moment
the
gentleman
in
the
came
out
he
took
the
part
of
the
inspector
and
began
a
violent
discussion
with
the
both
of
them
had
hold
of
ganimard
one
pushing
him
forward
the
other
back
until
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
and
angry
protests
the
unhappy
man
was
hustled
to
the
bottom
of
the
steps
a
crowd
gathered
at
once
two
policemen
attracted
by
the
excitement
tried
to
make
their
way
through
but
they
encountered
an
incomprehensible
resistance
and
were
unable
to
get
clear
of
the
shoulders
that
pushed
against
them
the
backs
that
barred
their
progress
and
suddenly
as
though
by
enchantment
the
way
was
opened
the
realizing
his
mistake
made
the
most
abject
apologies
the
gentleman
in
the
withdrew
his
assistance
the
crowd
parted
the
policemen
passed
in
and
ganimard
rushed
toward
the
table
with
the
six
guests
there
were
only
five
left
he
looked
round
there
was
no
way
out
except
the
door
where
is
the
person
who
was
sitting
here
he
shouted
to
the
five
bewildered
guests
yes
there
were
six
of
you
where
is
the
sixth
m
destro
no
no
arsène
lupin
a
waiter
stepped
up
the
gentleman
has
just
gone
up
to
the
mezzanine
floor
ganimard
flew
upstairs
the
mezzanine
floor
consisted
of
private
rooms
and
had
a
separate
exit
to
the
boulevard
it
no
use
now
groaned
ganimard
he
far
away
by
this
time
he
was
not
so
very
far
away
two
hundred
yards
at
most
in
the
omnibus
running
between
the
bastille
and
the
madeleine
which
lumbered
peacefully
along
behind
its
three
horses
crossing
the
place
de
and
going
down
the
boulevard
des
capucines
two
tall
fellows
in
bowler
hats
stood
talking
on
the
conductor
platform
on
the
top
near
the
steps
a
little
old
man
sat
dozing
it
was
holmlock
shears
and
with
his
head
swaying
from
side
to
side
rocked
by
the
movement
of
the
omnibus
the
englishman
soliloquized
ah
if
dear
old
wilson
could
see
me
now
how
proud
he
would
be
of
his
chief
pooh
it
was
easy
to
foresee
from
the
moment
when
the
whistle
sounded
that
the
game
was
up
and
that
there
was
nothing
serious
to
be
done
except
to
keep
a
watch
around
the
restaurant
but
that
devil
of
a
man
adds
a
zest
to
life
and
no
mistake
on
reaching
the
end
of
the
journey
shears
leant
over
saw
arsène
lupin
pass
out
in
front
of
his
guards
and
heard
him
mutter
at
the
étoile
the
étoile
just
so
an
assignation
i
shall
be
there
i
let
him
go
ahead
in
that
while
i
follow
his
two
pals
in
a
the
two
pals
went
off
on
foot
made
for
the
étoile
and
rang
at
the
door
of
no
rue
chalgrin
a
house
with
a
narrow
frontage
shears
found
a
hiding
place
in
the
shadow
of
a
recess
formed
by
the
angle
of
that
unfrequented
little
street
one
of
the
two
windows
on
the
ground
floor
opened
and
a
man
in
a
bowler
hat
closed
the
shutters
the
window
space
above
the
shutters
was
lit
up
in
ten
minutes
time
a
gentleman
came
and
rang
at
the
same
door
and
immediately
afterward
another
person
and
at
last
a
drew
up
and
shears
saw
two
people
get
out
arsène
lupin
and
a
lady
wrapped
in
a
cloak
and
a
thick
veil
the
blonde
lady
i
presume
thought
shears
as
the
cab
drove
away
he
waited
for
a
moment
went
up
to
the
house
climbed
on
to
the
and
by
standing
on
succeeded
in
peering
into
the
room
through
that
part
of
the
window
which
the
shutters
failed
to
cover
arsène
lupin
was
leaning
against
the
chimney
and
talking
in
an
animated
fashion
the
others
stood
round
and
listened
attentively
shears
recognized
the
gentleman
in
the
and
thought
he
recognized
the
of
the
restaurant
as
for
the
blonde
lady
she
was
sitting
in
a
chair
with
her
back
turned
toward
him
they
are
holding
a
council
he
thought
this
evening
occurrences
have
alarmed
them
and
they
feel
a
need
to
discuss
things
oh
if
i
could
only
catch
them
all
at
one
swoop
one
of
the
accomplices
moved
and
shears
leapt
down
and
fell
back
into
the
shadow
the
gentleman
in
the
and
the
left
the
house
then
the
first
floor
was
lit
up
and
some
one
closed
the
it
was
now
dark
above
and
below
he
and
she
have
remained
on
the
ground
floor
said
holmlock
to
himself
the
two
accomplices
live
on
the
first
story
he
waited
during
a
part
of
the
night
without
stirring
from
his
place
fearing
lest
arsène
lupin
should
go
away
during
his
absence
at
four
in
the
morning
seeing
two
policemen
at
the
end
of
the
street
he
went
up
to
them
explained
the
position
and
left
them
to
watch
the
house
then
he
went
to
ganimard
flat
in
the
rue
pergolèse
and
told
the
servant
to
wake
him

got
him

a
dozen

shears
of
the
two
policemen
watching
the
house
no
sir
none
the
daylight
was
beginning
to
show
in
the
sky
when
the
commissary
after
disposing
his
men
rang
and
entered
the
lodge
of
the
concierge
terrified
by
this
intrusion
the
woman
all
trembling
said
that

was
no

the
ground
floor

ganimard

the
people

key
the
commissary
opened
the
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
passage
the
ground
floor
flat
contained
only
two
rooms
they
were
empty

the
commissary
grinned

first

the
two
gentleman

they
all

upstairs
and
the
commissary
rang
at
the
second
ring
a
man
who
was
none
other
than
one
of
the
bodyguards
appeared
in
his
and
with
a
furious
air
well
what
is
it
what
all
this
noise
about
what
do
you
come

in
confusion

and
you

ganimard
what
can
i

there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
ganimard
was
splitting
with
a
fit
of
merriment
which
doubled
him
up
and
seemed
to
threaten
an
apoplectic
fit
it
you
leroux
he
spluttered
out
oh
that
the
best
thing
i
ever
heard

visit
another
man
came
forward
at
the
sight
of
whom
ganimard
hilarity
increased
still
further
well
i
never
dear
dear
me
ah
my
friends
you
in
a
nice
pickle
who
would
have
suspected
it
it
a
good
thing
that
old
ganimard
keeps
his
eyes
open
and
still
better
that
he
has
friends
to
help
him
friends
who
have
come
all
the
way
from
england
and
turning
to
shears
he
said
shears
let
me
introduce
victor
leroux
one
of
the
best
in
the
iron
brigade
and
edmond
leroux
in
the
department
chapter
v
kidnapped
holmlock
shears
restrained
his
feelings
what
was
the
use
of
protesting
of
accusing
those
two
men
short
of
proofs
which
he
did
not
possess
and
which
he
would
not
waste
time
in
looking
for
no
one
would
take
his
word
with
nerves
on
edge
and
fists
he
had
but
one
thought
that
of
not
betraying
his
rage
and
disappointment
before
the
triumphant
ganimard
he
bowed
politely
to
those
two
mainstays
of
society
the
brothers
leroux
and
went
downstairs
in
the
hall
he
turned
toward
a
small
low
door
which
marked
the
entrance
to
the
cellar
and
picked
up
a
small
red
stone
it
was
a
garnet
outside
he
looked
up
and
read
close
to
the
number
of
the
house
the
inscription
destange
he
saw
the
same
inscription
on
no
always
that
double
outlet
he
thought
nos
and
communicate
why
did
i
not
think
of
it
before
i
ought
to
have
stayed
with
the
policemen
all
night
and
addressing
them
he
said
pointing
to
the
door
of
the
next
house
did
two
people
go
out
by
that
door
while
i
was
away
yes
sir
a
lady
and
gentleman
he
took
the
arm
of
the
and
led
him
along
ganimard
you
have
enjoyed
too
hearty
a
laugh
to
be
very
angry
with
me
for
disturbing
you
like
this
oh
i
not
angry
with
you
at
all
that
right
but
the
best
jokes

on
forever
and
i
think
we
must
put
an
end
to
this
one
i
am
with
you
this
is
our
seventh
day
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
be
in
london
in
three
days
hence
i
say
i
say
i
shall
be
there
though
and
i
beg
you
to
hold
yourself
in
readiness
on
tuesday
night
for
an
expedition
of
the
same
kind
asked
ganimard
chaffingly
yes
of
the
same
kind
and
how
will
this
one
end
in
lupin
capture
you
think
so
i
swear
it
on
my
honour
shears
took
his
leave
and
went
to
seek
a
short
rest
in
the
nearest
hotel
after
which
refreshed
and
full
of
confidence
he
returned
to
the
rue
chalgrin
slipped
two
louis
into
the
hand
of
the
concierge
made
sure
that
the
brothers
leroux
were
out
learned
that
the
house
belonged
to
a
certain
harmingeat
and
carrying
a
candle
found
his
way
down
to
the
cellar
through
the
little
door
near
which
he
had
picked
up
the
garnet
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
picked
up
another
of
exactly
the
same
shape
i
was
right
he
thought
this
forms
the
communication
let
see
if
my
opens
the
door
of
the
cellar
that
belongs
to
the
tenant
yes
capital
now
let
examine
these
aha
here
are
places
where
the
dust
has
been
removed
and
footprints
on
the
floor
a
slight
sound
made
him
prick
up
his
ears
he
quickly
closed
the
door
blew
out
his
candle
and
hid
behind
a
stack
of
empty
after
a
few
seconds
he
noticed
that
one
of
the
iron
bins
was
turning
slowly
on
a
pivot
carrying
with
it
the
whole
of
the
piece
of
wall
to
which
it
was
fastened
the
light
of
a
lantern
was
thrown
into
the
cellar
an
arm
appeared
a
man
entered
he
was
bent
in
two
like
a
man
looking
for
something
he
fumbled
in
the
dust
with
his
and
several
times
he
straightened
himself
and
threw
something
into
a
cardboard
box
which
he
carried
in
his
left
hand
next
he
removed
the
marks
of
his
footsteps
as
well
as
those
left
by
lupin
and
the
blonde
lady
and
went
back
to
the
he
gave
a
hoarse
cry
and
fell
shears
had
leapt
upon
him
it
was
the
matter
of
a
moment
and
in
the
simplest
way
possible
the
man
found
himself
stretched
on
the
floor
with
his
ankles
fastened
together
and
his
wrists
bound
the
englishman
stooped
over
him
how
much
will
you
take
to
speak
to
tell
what
you
know
the
man
replied
with
so
sarcastic
a
smile
that
shears
understood
the
futility
of
his
question
he
contented
himself
with
exploring
his
captive
pockets
but
his
investigations
produced
nothing
more
than
a
bunch
of
keys
a
and
the
little
cardboard
box
used
by
the
fellow
and
containing
a
dozen
garnets
similar
to
those
which
shears
had
picked
up
a
poor
booty
besides
what
was
he
to
do
with
the
man
wait
until
his
friends
came
to
his
assistance
and
hand
them
all
over
to
the
police
what
was
the
good
what
advantage
could
he
derive
from
it
against
lupin
he
was
hesitating
when
a
glance
at
the
box
made
him
come
to
a
decision
it
bore
the
address
of
léonard
jeweler
rue
de
la
paix
he
resolved
simply
to
leave
the
man
where
he
was
he
pushed
back
the
bin
shut
the
and
left
the
house
he
went
to
a
and
telegraphed
to
destange
that
he
could
not
come
until
the
next
day
then
he
went
on
to
the
jeweler
and
handed
him
the
garnets
madame
sent
me
with
these
stones
they
came
off
a
piece
of
jewelry
which
she
bought
here
shears
had
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
the
jeweler
replied
that
right
the
lady
telephoned
to
me
she
will
call
here
herself
presently
it
was
five
before
shears
standing
on
the
pavement
saw
a
lady
arrive
wrapped
in
a
thick
veil
whose
appearance
struck
him
as
suspicious
through
the
he
saw
her
place
on
the
counter
an
brooch
set
with
garnets
she
went
away
almost
at
once
did
a
few
errands
on
foot
walked
up
toward
clichy
and
turned
down
streets
which
the
englishman
did
not
know
at
nightfall
he
followed
her
unperceived
by
the
concierge
into
a
house
built
on
either
side
of
the
doorway
and
therefore
containing
numberless
flats
she
stopped
at
a
door
on
the
second
floor
and
went
in
two
minutes
later
the
englishman
put
his
luck
to
the
test
and
one
after
the
other
carefully
tried
the
keys
on
the
bunch
of
which
he
had
obtained
possession
the
fourth
key
fitted
the
lock
through
the
darkness
that
filled
them
he
saw
rooms
which
were
absolutely
empty
like
those
of
an
unoccupied
flat
with
all
the
doors
standing
open
but
the
light
of
a
lamp
filtered
through
from
the
end
of
a
passage
and
approaching
on
through
the
glass
door
that
separated
the
from
an
adjoining
bedroom
he
saw
the
veiled
lady
take
off
her
dress
and
hat
lay
them
on
the
one
chair
which
the
room
contained
and
slip
on
a
velvet
and
he
also
saw
her
walk
up
to
the
and
push
an
electric
bell
and
of
the
panel
to
the
right
of
the
chimney
moved
from
its
position
and
slipped
along
the
wall
into
the
thickness
of
the
next
panel
as
soon
as
the
gap
was
wide
enough
the
lady
passed
through
and
disappeared
taking
the
lamp
with
her
the
system
was
a
simple
one
shears
employed
it
he
found
himself
walking
in
the
dark
groping
his
way
but
suddenly
his
face
came
upon
something
soft
by
the
light
of
a
match
he
saw
that
he
was
in
a
little
closet
filled
with
dresses
and
clothes
hanging
from
metal
bars
he
thrust
his
way
through
and
stopped
before
the
embrasure
of
a
door
closed
by
a
tapestry
hanging
or
at
least
by
the
back
of
a
hanging
and
his
match
being
now
burnt
out
he
saw
light
piercing
through
the
loose
and
worn
woof
of
the
old
stuff
then
he
looked
the
blonde
lady
was
there
before
his
eyes
within
reach
of
his
hand
she
put
out
the
lamp
and
turned
on
the
electric
switch
for
the
first
time
shears
saw
her
face
in
the
full
light
he
gave
a
start
the
woman
whom
he
had
ended
by
overtaking
after
so
many
shifts
and
turns
was
none
other
than
clotilde
destange
clotilde
destange
the
murderess
of
baron
and
the
purloiner
of
the
blue
diamond
clotilde
destange
the
mysterious
friend
of
arsène
lupin
the
blonde
lady
in
short
why
of
course
he
thought
i
the
biggest
blockhead
that
ever
lived
just
because
lupin
friend
is
fair
and
clotilde
dark
i
never
thought
of
connecting
the
two
women
as
though
the
blonde
lady
could
afford
to
continue
fair
after
the
murder
of
the
baron
and
the
theft
of
the
diamond
shears
saw
part
of
the
room
an
elegant
lady
boudoir
adorned
with
light
hangings
and
valuable
a
mahogany
settee
stood
on
a
platform
clotilde
had
sat
down
on
it
and
remained
motionless
with
her
head
between
her
hands
and
soon
he
noticed
that
she
was
crying
great
tears
flowed
down
her
pale
cheeks
trickled
by
her
mouth
fell
drop
by
drop
on
the
velvet
of
her
bodice
and
more
tears
followed
indefinitely
as
though
springing
from
an
inexhaustible
source
and
no
sadder
sight
was
ever
seen
than
that
dull
and
resigned
despair
which
expressed
itself
in
the
slow
flowing
of
the
tears
but
a
door
opened
behind
her
arsène
lupin
entered
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
long
time
without
exchanging
a
word
then
he
knelt
down
beside
her
pressed
his
head
to
her
breast
put
his
arms
round
her
and
there
was
infinite
tenderness
and
great
pity
in
the
gesture
with
which
he
embraced
the
girl
they
did
not
move
a
soft
silence
united
them
and
her
tears
flowed
less
abundantly
i
so
much
wanted
to
make
you
happy
he
whispered
i
am
happy
no
for
you
crying
and
your
tears
break
my
heart
clotilde
yielding
in
spite
of
herself
to
the
sound
of
his
coaxing
voice
she
listened
greedy
of
hope
and
happiness
a
smile
softened
her
face
but
oh
so
sad
a
smile
he
entreated
her
do
be
sad
clotilde
you
have
no
reason
you
have
no
right
to
be
sad
she
showed
him
her
white
delicate
lissom
hands
and
said
gravely
as
long
as
these
hands
are
mine
maxime
i
shall
be
sad
but
why
they
have
taken
life
maxime
cried
hush
you
must
not
think
of
that
the
past
is
dead
the
past
does
not
count
and
he
kissed
her
long
white
hands
and
she
looked
at
him
with
a
brighter
smile
as
though
each
kiss
had
wiped
out
a
little
of
that
hideous
memory
you
must
love
me
maxime
you
must
because
no
woman
will
ever
love
you
as
i
do
to
please
you
i
have
acted
i
am
still
acting
not
only
according
to
your
orders
but
according
to
your
unspoken
wishes
i
do
things
against
which
all
my
instincts
and
all
my
conscience
revolt
but
i
am
unable
to
resist
all
that
i
do
i
do
mechanically
because
it
is
of
use
to
you
and
you
wish
it
and
i
am
ready
to
begin
again
and
always
he
said
bitterly
ah
clotilde
why
did
i
ever
mix
you
up
in
my
adventurous
life
i
ought
to
have
remained
the
maxime
bermond
whom
you
loved
five
years
ago
and
not
have
let
you
know
the
other
man
that
i
am
she
whispered
very
low
i
love
that
other
man
too
and
i
regret
nothing
yes
you
regret
your
past
life
your
life
in
the
light
of
day
i
regret
nothing
when
you
are
there
she
said
passionately
there
is
no
such
thing
as
guilt
no
such
thing
as
crime
when
my
eyes
see
you
what
do
i
care
if
i
am
unhappy
away
from
you
and
if
i
suffer
and
cry
and
loathe
all
that
i
do
your
love
wipes
out
everything
i
accept
everything
but
you
must
love
me
i
do
not
love
you
because
i
must
clotilde
but
simply
because
i
love
you
are
you
sure
she
asked
trustingly
i
am
as
sure
of
myself
as
i
am
of
you
only
clotilde
my
life
is
a
violent
and
feverish
one
and
i
can
not
always
give
you
as
much
time
as
i
should
wish
she
at
once
grew
terrified
what
is
it
a
fresh
danger
tell
me
quick
oh
nothing
serious
as
yet
still
still
what
well
he
is
on
our
track
shears
yes
it
was
he
who
set
ganimard
at
me
at
the
restaurant
hongrois
it
was
he
who
posted
the
two
policemen
in
the
rue
chalgrin
last
night
the
proof
is
that
ganimard
searched
the
house
this
morning
and
shears
was
with
him
besides
besides
what
well
there
is
something
more
one
of
our
men
is
missing
jeanniot
the
concierge
yes
why
i
sent
him
to
the
rue
chalgrin
this
morning
to
pick
up
some
garnets
which
had
fallen
from
my
brooch
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
shears
has
caught
him
in
a
trap
not
at
all
the
garnets
were
brought
to
the
jeweler
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
then
what
has
become
of
jeanniot
since
oh
maxime
i
so
frightened
there
no
cause
for
alarm
but
i
admit
that
the
position
is
very
serious
how
much
does
he
know
where
is
he
hiding
his
strength
lies
in
his
isolation
there
is
nothing
to
betray
him
then
what
have
you
decided
on
extreme
prudence
clotilde
some
time
ago
i
made
up
my
mind
to
move
my
things
to
the
refuge
you
know
of
the
safe
refuge
the
intervention
of
shears
hastens
the
need
when
a
man
like
shears
is
on
a
trail
we
may
take
it
that
he
is
bound
to
follow
that
trail
to
the
end
so
i
have
made
all
my
preparations
the
removal
will
take
place
on
the
day
after
wednesday
it
will
be
finished
by
midday
by
two
i
shall
be
able
myself
to
leave
after
getting
rid
of
the
last
vestige
of
our
occupation
which
is
no
small
matter
until
then
yes
we
must
not
see
each
other
and
no
one
must
see
you
clotilde
do
go
out
i
fear
nothing
for
myself
but
i
fear
everything
where
concerned
it
is
impossible
for
that
englishman
to
get
at
me
everything
is
possible
to
him
and
i
am
not
easy
in
my
mind
yesterday
when
i
was
nearly
caught
by
your
father
i
had
come
to
search
the
cupboard
which
contains
destange
old
ledgers
there
is
danger
there
there
is
danger
everywhere
i
feel
that
the
enemy
is
prowling
in
the
shade
and
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
i
know
that
he
is
watching
us
that
he
is
laying
his
nets
around
us
it
is
one
of
those
intuitions
which
never
fail
me
in
that
case
said
she
go
maxime
and
think
no
more
about
my
tears
i
shall
be
brave
and
i
will
wait
until
the
danger
is
over
maxime
she
gave
him
a
long
kiss
and
she
herself
pushed
him
outside
shears
heard
the
sound
of
their
voices
grow
fainter
in
the
distance
boldly
excited
by
the
need
of
action
toward
and
against
everything
which
had
been
stimulating
him
since
the
day
before
he
made
his
way
to
a
passage
at
the
end
of
which
was
a
staircase
but
just
as
he
was
going
down
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
conversation
below
and
thought
it
better
to
follow
a
circular
corridor
which
brought
him
to
another
staircase
at
the
foot
of
this
staircase
he
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
furniture
the
shape
and
position
of
which
he
already
knew
a
door
stood
half
open
he
entered
a
large
round
room
it
was
library
capital
splendid
he
muttered
i
understand
everything
now
the
boudoir
of
clotilde
that
is
to
say
the
blonde
lady
communicates
with
one
of
the
flats
in
the
next
house
and
the
door
of
that
house
is
not
in
the
place
malesherbes
but
in
an
adjoining
street
the
rue
montchanin
if
i
remember
right
admirable
and
now
i
see
how
clotilde
destange
slips
out
to
meet
her
sweetheart
while
keeping
up
the
reputation
of
a
person
who
never
leaves
the
house
and
i
also
see
how
arsène
lupin
popped
out
close
to
me
yesterday
evening
in
the
gallery
there
must
be
another
communication
between
the
flat
next
door
and
this
library
and
he
concluded
another
faked
house
once
again
no
doubt
architect
and
what
i
must
now
do
is
to
take
advantage
of
my
presence
here
to
examine
the
contents
of
the
cupboard
and
obtain
all
the
information
i
can
about
the
other
faked
houses
shears
went
up
to
the
gallery
and
hid
behind
the
hangings
of
the
rail
he
stayed
there
till
the
end
of
the
evening
a
came
to
put
out
the
electric
lights
an
hour
later
the
englishman
pressed
the
spring
of
his
lantern
and
went
down
to
the
cupboard
as
he
knew
it
contained
the
architect
old
papers
files
plans
estimates
and
at
the
back
stood
a
row
of
ledgers
arranged
in
chronological
order
he
took
down
the
more
recent
volumes
one
by
one
and
at
once
looked
through
the
more
particularly
under
the
letter
at
last
finding
the
word
harmingeat
followed
by
the
number
he
turned
up
page
and
read
harmingeat
rue
chalgrin
there
followed
a
detailed
statement
of
works
executed
for
this
customer
with
a
view
to
the
installation
of
a
central
in
his
property
and
in
the
margin
was
this
note
see
file
m
b
i
knew
it
muttered
shears
file
is
the
one
i
want
when
i
have
been
through
that
i
shall
know
the
whereabouts
of
lupin
present
abode
the
small
hours
had
struck
before
he
found
file
b
it
consisted
of
fifteen
pages
one
was
a
copy
of
the
page
concerning
harmingeat
of
the
rue
chalgrin
another
contained
a
detailed
account
of
works
executed
for
vatinel
the
owner
of
rue
clapeyron
a
third
was
devoted
to
baron
avenue
a
fourth
to
the
château
de
crozon
and
the
eleven
others
to
different
paris
landlords
shears
took
down
the
list
of
eleven
names
and
addresses
and
then
restored
the
papers
to
their
place
opened
a
window
and
jumped
out
into
the
deserted
square
taking
care
to
close
the
shutters
behind
him
on
reaching
his
room
at
the
hotel
he
lit
his
pipe
with
the
gravity
which
he
always
applied
to
that
ceremony
and
enveloped
in
clouds
of
smoke
studied
the
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
file
or
to
be
more
exact
the
file
devoted
to
maxime
bermond
arsène
lupin
at
eight
he
sent
ganimard
an
express
letter
i
shall
probably
call
on
you
in
the
rue
pergolèse
this
morning
and
place
in
your
charge
a
person
whose
capture
is
of
the
highest
importance
in
any
case
stay
at
home
and
until
twelve
wednesday
morning
and
arrange
to
have
thirty
men
at
your
disposal
then
he
went
down
the
boulevard
picked
out
a
with
a
driver
whose
but
unintelligent
face
took
his
fancy
and
drove
to
the
place
malesherbes
fifty
yards
beyond
the
hôtel
destange
close
the
hood
my
man
he
said
to
the
driver
turn
up
the
collar
of
your
fur
for
it
a
cold
wind
and
wait
for
me
patiently
start
your
engine
in
an
hour
and
a
half
from
now
the
moment
i
get
in
again
drive
straight
to
the
rue
pergolèse
with
his
foot
on
the
doorstep
of
the
house
he
had
a
last
moment
of
hesitation
was
it
not
a
mistake
to
take
so
much
trouble
about
the
blonde
lady
when
lupin
was
completing
his
preparations
for
departure
and
would
he
not
have
done
better
with
the
aid
of
his
list
of
houses
to
begin
by
finding
out
where
his
adversary
lived
pooh
he
said
when
the
blonde
lady
is
my
prisoner
i
shall
be
master
of
the
situation
and
he
rang
the
bell
he
found
destange
waiting
in
the
library
they
worked
together
for
a
little
while
and
shears
was
seeking
a
pretext
to
go
up
to
room
when
the
girl
entered
said
to
her
father
sat
down
in
the
little
and
began
to
write
letters
from
where
he
was
sitting
shears
could
see
her
as
she
bent
over
the
table
and
from
time
to
time
meditated
with
poised
pen
and
a
thoughtful
face
he
waited
and
then
taking
up
a
volume
said
to
destange
oh
this
is
the
book
which
mlle
destange
asked
me
to
give
her
when
i
found
it
he
went
into
the
little
room
stood
in
front
of
clotilde
in
such
a
way
that
her
father
could
not
see
her
and
said
i
am
stickmann
destange
new
secretary
oh
she
said
without
moving
has
my
father
changed
his
secretary
yes
mademoiselle
and
i
should
like
to
speak
to
you
take
a
seat
monsieur
i
have
just
finished
she
added
a
few
words
to
her
letter
signed
it
sealed
the
envelope
pushed
back
her
papers
took
up
the
telephone
asked
to
be
put
on
to
her
dressmaker
begged
her
to
hurry
on
a
which
she
needed
urgently
and
then
turning
to
shears
i
am
at
your
service
monsieur
but
can
not
our
conversation
take
place
before
my
father
no
mademoiselle
and
i
will
even
entreat
you
not
to
raise
your
voice
it
would
be
better
that
destange
should
not
hear
us
better
for
whom
for
you
mademoiselle
i
will
not
permit
a
conversation
which
my
father
can
not
hear
and
yet
you
must
permit
this
one
they
both
rose
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
each
other
and
she
said
speak
monsieur
still
standing
he
began
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
am
inaccurate
in
a
few
less
important
particulars
i
will
vouch
for
the
general
correctness
of
what
i
am
going
to
say
no
speeches
i
beg
facts
he
felt
from
this
abrupt
interruption
that
the
girl
was
on
her
guard
and
he
continued
very
well
i
will
come
straight
to
the
point
five
years
ago
your
father
happened
to
meet
a
maxime
bermond
who
introduced
himself
as
a
contractor
or
an
architect
i
am
not
sure
which
in
any
case
destange
took
a
liking
to
this
young
man
and
as
the
state
of
his
health
no
longer
allowed
him
to
attend
to
his
business
he
entrusted
to
bermond
the
execution
of
a
few
orders
which
he
had
accepted
to
please
some
old
customers
and
which
appeared
to
him
to
come
within
the
scope
of
his
assistant
capacity
shears
stopped
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
girl
had
grown
paler
still
she
answered
with
the
greatest
calmness
i
know
nothing
of
the
things
about
which
you
are
talking
monsieur
and
i
am
quite
unable
to
see
how
they
can
interest
me
they
interest
you
in
so
far
mademoiselle
that
maxime
real
name
which
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
is
arsène
lupin
she
burst
out
laughing
nonsense
arsène
lupin
maxime
bermond
name
is
arsène
lupin
as
i
have
the
honour
to
inform
you
mademoiselle
and
since
you
refuse
to
understand
me
unless
i
speak
plainly
i
will
add
that
arsène
lupin
to
accomplish
his
designs
has
found
in
this
house
a
friend
more
than
a
friend
a
blind
and
passionately
devoted
accomplice
she
rose
and
betraying
no
emotion
or
at
least
so
little
emotion
that
shears
was
impressed
by
her
extraordinary
said
i
do
not
know
the
reason
for
your
behaviour
monsieur
and
i
have
no
wish
to
know
it
i
will
ask
you
therefore
not
to
add
another
word
and
to
leave
the
room
i
had
no
intention
mademoiselle
of
imposing
my
presence
upon
you
indefinitely
said
shears
as
calmly
as
herself
only
i
have
resolved
not
to
leave
this
house
alone
and
who
is
going
with
you
monsieur
you
i
yes
mademoiselle
we
shall
leave
this
house
together
and
you
will
accompany
me
without
a
word
without
a
protest
the
strange
feature
of
this
scene
was
the
absolute
coolness
of
the
two
adversaries
to
judge
by
their
attitudes
and
the
tone
of
their
voices
it
might
have
been
a
courteous
discussion
between
two
people
who
differ
in
opinion
rather
than
an
implacable
duel
between
two
powerful
wills
through
the
great
open
recess
destange
could
be
seen
in
the
round
library
handling
his
books
with
leisurely
movements
clotilde
sat
down
again
with
a
slight
shrug
of
the
shoulders
holmlock
shears
took
out
his
watch
it
is
now
ten
we
will
start
in
five
minutes
and
if
i
refuse
if
you
refuse
i
shall
go
to
destange
and
tell
him
what
the
truth
i
shall
describe
to
him
the
false
life
led
by
maxime
bermond
and
the
double
life
of
his
accomplice
of
his
accomplice
yes
of
the
one
known
as
the
blonde
lady
the
lady
whose
hair
was
once
fair
and
what
proofs
will
you
give
him
i
shall
take
him
to
the
rue
chalgrin
and
show
him
the
passage
which
arsène
lupin
when
managing
the
works
made
his
men
construct
between
nos
and
the
passage
employed
by
the
two
of
you
on
the
night
before
last
next
next
i
shall
take
destange
to
maître
detinan
we
will
go
down
the
servants
staircase
which
you
ran
down
with
arsène
lupin
to
escape
ganimard
and
we
will
both
look
for
the
doubtless
similar
means
of
communication
with
the
next
house
which
has
its
entrance
on
the
boulevard
des
batignolles
and
not
in
the
rue
clapeyron
next
next
i
shall
take
destange
to
the
château
de
crozon
and
it
will
be
easy
for
him
who
knows
the
nature
of
the
works
executed
by
arsène
lupin
at
the
time
of
the
restoration
of
the
château
to
discover
the
secret
passages
which
arsène
lupin
made
his
men
construct
he
will
find
that
these
passages
enabled
the
blonde
lady
to
enter
madame
de
crozon
room
at
night
and
take
the
blue
diamond
from
the
chimney
and
a
fortnight
later
to
enter
herr
bleichen
room
and
hide
the
blue
diamond
at
the
bottom
of
a
flask
a
rather
queer
thing
to
do
i
admit
perhaps
it
was
a
woman
petty
vengeance
i
do
not
know
and
it
makes
no
difference
next
next
said
holmlock
shears
in
a
more
serious
voice
i
shall
take
destange
to
avenue
and
together
we
will
try
to
discover
how
baron
hush
hush
stammered
the
girl
in
sudden
dismay
you
must
not
do
you
dare
to
say
it
was
i
do
you
accuse
me
i
accuse
you
of
killing
baron
no
no
this
is
monstrous
you
killed
baron
mademoiselle
you
entered
his
service
under
the
name
of
antoinette
bréhat
with
the
intention
of
robbing
him
of
the
blue
diamond
and
you
killed
him
again
she
murmured
breaking
down
and
reduced
to
entreaties
hush
monsieur
i
beg
as
you
know
so
much
you
must
also
know
that
i
did
not
murder
the
baron
i
did
not
say
that
you
murdered
him
mademoiselle
baron
was
subject
to
fits
of
insanity
which
only
soeur
auguste
was
able
to
check
she
has
told
me
this
herself
he
must
have
thrown
himself
upon
you
in
her
absence
and
it
was
in
the
course
of
the
ensuing
struggle
that
you
struck
at
him
in
appalled
by
what
you
had
done
you
rang
the
bell
and
fled
without
even
taking
from
his
finger
the
blue
diamond
which
you
had
come
to
secure
a
moment
later
you
returned
with
one
of
lupin
accomplices
a
in
the
next
house
lifted
the
baron
on
to
his
bed
and
arranged
the
room
but
still
without
daring
to
take
the
blue
diamond
that
what
happened
therefore
i
repeat
you
did
not
murder
the
baron
and
yet
it
was
your
hands
that
killed
him
she
was
holding
them
clasped
before
her
forehead
her
slim
white
delicate
hands
and
she
kept
them
long
like
that
motionless
then
uncrossing
her
fingers
she
showed
her
face
and
said
and
you
mean
to
tell
all
this
to
my
father
yes
and
i
shall
tell
him
that
i
have
as
witnesses
mlle
gerbois
who
will
recognize
the
blonde
lady
soeur
auguste
who
will
recognize
antoinette
bréhat
the
comtesse
de
crozon
who
will
recognize
mme
de
réal
that
is
what
i
shall
tell
him
you
will
not
dare
she
said
recovering
her
presence
of
mind
in
the
face
of
immediate
danger
he
rose
and
took
a
step
toward
the
library
clotilde
stopped
him
one
moment
monsieur
she
reflected
and
now
fully
mistress
of
herself
asked
very
calmly
you
are
holmlock
shears
are
you
not
yes
what
do
you
want
with
me
what
do
i
want
i
have
entered
upon
a
contest
with
arsène
lupin
from
which
i
must
emerge
the
winner
pending
a
result
which
can
not
be
far
distant
i
am
of
opinion
that
a
hostage
as
valuable
as
yourself
will
give
me
a
considerable
advantage
over
my
adversary
you
shall
go
with
me
therefore
mademoiselle
and
i
will
place
you
under
the
care
of
a
friend
of
mine
as
soon
as
my
object
is
attained
you
shall
be
set
free
is
that
all
that
is
all
i
do
not
belong
to
the
police
of
your
country
and
consequently
i
claim
no
no
justiciary
rights
her
mind
appeared
made
up
however
she
asked
for
a
moment
delay
her
eyelids
closed
and
shears
stood
watching
her
suddenly
grown
calm
almost
indifferent
to
the
perils
that
threatened
her
i
wonder
thought
the
englishman
if
she
believes
herself
to
be
in
danger
probably
not
with
lupin
to
protect
her
with
lupin
there
nothing
can
happen
to
her
she
thinks
lupin
is
omnipotent
lupin
is
infallible
mademoiselle
he
said
aloud
i
spoke
of
five
minutes
it
is
now
more
than
thirty
may
i
go
to
my
room
monsieur
and
fetch
my
things
if
you
like
mademoiselle
i
will
go
and
wait
for
you
in
the
rue
montchanin
i
am
a
great
friend
of
jeanniot
the
concierge
ah
so
you
know
she
said
with
visible
dismay
i
know
a
great
many
things
very
well
then
i
will
ring
the
servant
brought
her
hat
and
cloak
and
shears
said
you
must
give
destange
some
reason
to
explain
our
departure
and
the
reason
must
be
enough
in
case
of
need
to
explain
your
absence
for
two
or
three
days
that
is
unnecessary
i
shall
be
back
presently
again
they
exchanged
a
defiant
glance
skeptical
both
of
them
and
smiling
how
you
trust
him
said
shears
blindly
whatever
he
does
is
right
is
it
not
whatever
he
wishes
is
realized
and
you
approve
of
everything
and
are
prepared
to
do
everything
for
his
sake
i
love
him
she
said
with
a
tremor
of
passion
and
you
believe
that
he
will
save
you
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
going
up
to
her
father
told
him
i
am
robbing
you
of
stickmann
we
are
going
to
the
national
library
will
you
be
back
to
lunch
perhaps
or
more
likely
not
but
do
worry
about
me
in
any
case
and
in
a
firm
voice
she
said
to
shears
i
am
ready
monsieur
without
reserve
he
whispered
with
my
eyes
closed
if
you
try
to
escape
i
shall
shout
and
call
for
help
you
will
be
arrested
and
it
will
mean
prison
do
forget
that
there
is
a
warrant
out
against
the
blonde
lady
i
swear
to
you
on
my
honour
that
i
will
make
no
attempt
to
escape
i
believe
you
let
us
go
they
left
the
house
together
as
he
had
foretold
the
had
turned
round
and
was
waiting
in
the
square
they
could
see
the
driver
back
and
his
cap
which
was
almost
covered
by
the
upturned
collar
of
his
fur
as
they
approached
shears
heard
the
humming
of
the
engine
he
opened
the
door
asked
clotilde
to
step
in
and
sat
down
beside
her
the
car
started
with
a
jerk
and
soon
reached
the
outer
boulevards
the
avenue
hoche
the
avenue
de
la
shears
was
thinking
out
his
plans
ganimard
is
at
home
i
shall
leave
the
girl
with
him
shall
i
tell
him
who
she
is
no
he
would
take
her
straight
to
the
which
would
put
everything
out
as
soon
as
i
am
alone
i
will
consult
the
list
and
set
out
on
my
chase
and
or
morning
at
latest
i
shall
go
to
ganimard
as
arranged
and
deliver
arsène
lupin
and
his
gang
to
him
he
rubbed
his
hands
glad
to
feel
that
his
object
was
at
last
within
his
reach
and
to
see
that
there
was
no
serious
obstacle
in
the
way
and
yielding
to
a
need
for
expansion
which
was
not
in
keeping
with
his
usual
nature
he
said
forgive
me
mademoiselle
for
displaying
so
much
satisfaction
it
was
a
difficult
fight
and
i
find
my
success
particularly
agreeable
a
legitimate
success
monsieur
in
which
you
have
every
right
to
rejoice
thank
you
but
what
a
funny
way
we
are
going
did
the
man
understand
at
that
moment
they
were
leaving
paris
by
the
porte
de
neuilly
what
on
earth
after
all
the
rue
pergolèse
was
not
outside
the
fortifications
shears
let
down
the
glass
i
say
driver
you
going
wrong
rue
pergolèse
the
man
made
no
reply
shears
repeated
in
a
louder
voice
i
telling
you
to
go
to
the
rue
pergolèse
the
man
took
no
notice
look
here
my
man
are
you
deaf
or
are
you
doing
it
on
purpose
this
is
where
i
told
you
to
go
rue
pergolèse
do
you
hear
turn
round
at
once
and
look
sharp
about
it
still
no
reply
the
englishman
began
to
be
alarmed
he
looked
at
clotilde
a
queer
smile
was
playing
on
the
girl
lips
what
are
you
laughing
at
he
stormed
this
does
affect
it
has
nothing
to
say
to
nothing
in
the
very
least
she
replied
suddenly
he
was
taken
aback
by
an
idea
half
rising
from
his
seat
he
attentively
scrutinized
the
man
on
the
box
his
shoulders
were
slimmer
his
movements
easier
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
on
shears
forehead
his
hands
contracted
while
the
most
hideous
conviction
forced
itself
upon
his
mind
the
man
was
arsène
lupin
well
shears
what
do
you
think
of
this
little
drive
it
delightful
my
dear
sir
really
delightful
replied
shears
perhaps
he
had
never
in
his
life
made
a
more
tremendous
effort
than
it
cost
him
to
utter
those
words
without
a
tremor
in
his
voice
without
anything
that
could
betray
the
exasperation
that
filled
his
whole
being
but
the
minute
after
he
was
carried
away
by
a
sort
of
formidable
reaction
and
a
torrent
of
rage
and
hatred
burst
its
banks
overcame
his
will
and
made
him
suddenly
draw
his
revolver
and
point
it
at
mlle
destange
lupin
if
you
do
stop
this
minute
this
second
i
fire
at
mademoiselle
i
advise
you
to
aim
at
the
cheek
if
you
want
to
hit
the
temple
said
lupin
without
turning
his
head
clotilde
called
out
do
go
too
fast
maxime
the
pavement
is
very
slippery
and
you
know
how
timid
i
am
she
was
still
smiling
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
cobbles
with
which
the
road
bristled
in
front
of
the
car
stop
him
tell
him
to
stop
shouted
shears
beside
himself
with
fury
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
i
am
capable
of
anything
the
muzzle
of
the
revolver
grazed
her
hair
how
reckless
maxime
is
she
murmured
we
are
sure
to
skid
at
this
rate
shears
replaced
the
revolver
in
his
pocket
and
seized
the
handle
of
the
door
preparing
to
jump
out
in
spite
of
the
absurdity
of
the
act
take
care
shears
said
clotilde
there
a
behind
us
he
leant
out
a
car
was
following
them
an
enormous
car
with
its
pointed
bonnet
in
colour
and
the
four
men
in
furs
inside
it
ah
he
said
i
well
guarded
we
must
have
patience
he
crossed
his
arms
on
his
chest
with
the
proud
submission
of
those
who
bow
and
wait
when
fate
turns
against
them
and
while
they
crossed
the
seine
and
tore
through
suresnes
rueil
and
chatou
motionless
and
resigned
without
anger
or
bitterness
he
thought
only
of
discovering
by
what
miracle
arsène
lupin
had
put
himself
in
the
driver
place
that
the
decent
fellow
whom
he
had
picked
out
that
morning
on
the
boulevard
could
be
an
accomplice
posted
there
of
set
purpose
he
refused
to
admit
and
yet
arsène
lupin
must
have
received
a
warning
and
that
only
after
the
moment
when
he
shears
had
threatened
clotilde
for
no
one
suspected
his
plan
before
now
from
that
moment
clotilde
and
he
had
not
left
each
other
presence
suddenly
he
remembered
the
girl
telephoning
to
her
dressmaker
and
all
at
once
he
understood
even
before
he
spoke
at
the
very
moment
when
he
asked
for
an
interview
as
destange
new
secretary
she
had
scented
danger
guessed
the
visitor
name
and
object
and
coolly
naturally
as
though
she
were
really
doing
what
she
appeared
to
do
had
summoned
lupin
to
her
aid
under
the
pretense
of
speaking
to
one
of
her
tradespeople
and
by
means
of
a
formula
known
to
themselves
alone
how
arsène
lupin
had
come
how
that
in
waiting
with
its
throbbing
engine
had
aroused
his
suspicion
how
he
had
bribed
the
driver
all
this
mattered
little
what
interested
shears
almost
to
the
point
of
calming
his
rage
was
the
recollection
of
that
moment
in
which
a
mere
woman
a
woman
in
love
it
is
true
mastering
her
nerves
suppressing
her
instinct
controlling
the
features
of
her
face
and
the
expression
of
her
eyes
had
humbugged
old
holmlock
shears
what
was
he
to
do
against
a
man
served
by
such
allies
a
man
who
by
the
sheer
ascendancy
of
his
authority
inspired
a
woman
with
such
a
stock
of
daring
and
energy
they
the
seine
and
climbed
the
slope
of
but
five
hundred
yards
beyond
the
town
the
cab
slowed
down
the
other
car
came
up
with
it
and
the
two
stopped
alongside
there
was
no
one
about
shears
said
lupin
may
i
trouble
you
to
change
cars
ours
is
really
so
very
slow
certainly
said
shears
all
the
more
politely
as
he
had
no
choice
will
you
also
permit
me
to
lend
you
this
fur
for
we
shall
be
going
pretty
fast
and
to
offer
you
a
couple
of
sandwiches
yes
yes
take
them
there
no
telling
when
you
will
get
any
dinner
the
four
men
had
alighted
one
of
them
came
up
and
as
he
had
taken
off
the
goggles
which
disguised
him
shears
recognized
the
gentleman
in
the
whom
he
had
seen
at
the
restaurant
hongrois
lupin
gave
him
his
instructions
take
the
cab
back
to
the
driver
from
whom
i
hired
it
you
will
find
him
waiting
in
the
first
on
the
right
in
the
rue
legendre
pay
him
the
second
thousand
francs
i
promised
him
oh
i
was
forgetting
you
might
give
shears
your
goggles
he
spoke
a
few
words
to
mlle
destange
then
took
his
seat
at
the
wheel
and
drove
off
with
shears
beside
him
and
one
of
his
men
behind
lupin
had
not
exaggerated
when
saying
that
they
would
go
pretty
fast
they
travelled
at
a
giddy
pace
from
the
first
the
horizon
rushed
toward
them
as
though
attracted
by
a
mysterious
force
and
disappeared
at
the
same
moment
as
though
swallowed
up
by
an
abyss
into
which
other
things
trees
houses
plains
and
forests
plunged
with
the
tumultuous
speed
of
a
torrent
rushing
down
to
the
pool
below
shears
and
lupin
did
not
exchange
a
word
above
their
heads
the
leaves
of
the
poplars
made
a
great
noise
as
of
waves
punctuated
by
the
regular
spacing
of
the
trees
and
town
after
town
vanished
from
sight
mantes
vernon
gaillon
from
hill
to
hill
from
to
canteleu
rouen
with
her
suburbs
her
harbour
her
miles
upon
miles
of
quays
rouen
seemed
no
more
than
the
of
a
and
they
rushed
through
duclair
through
caudebec
through
the
pays
de
caux
skimming
over
its
hills
and
plains
in
their
powerful
flight
through
lillebonne
through
and
suddenly
they
were
on
the
bank
of
the
seine
at
the
end
of
a
small
quay
alongside
which
lay
a
built
on
sober
and
powerful
lines
with
black
smoke
curling
up
from
her
funnel
the
car
stopped
they
had
covered
over
a
hundred
miles
in
two
hours
a
man
dressed
in
a
blue
came
forward
and
touched
his
cap
well
done
captain
said
lupin
did
you
get
my
telegram
yes
sir
is
the
ready
quite
ready
sir
in
that
case
mr
shears
the
englishman
looked
around
him
saw
a
group
of
people
seated
outside
a
café
another
a
little
nearer
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
realizing
that
before
any
one
could
interfere
he
would
be
seized
forced
on
board
and
packed
off
at
the
bottom
of
the
hold
he
crossed
the
and
followed
lupin
into
the
captain
cabin
it
was
roomy
specklessly
clean
and
shone
brightly
with
its
varnished
wainscoting
and
gleaming
brass
lupin
closed
the
door
and
without
beating
about
the
bush
said
to
shears
almost
brutally
tell
me
exactly
how
much
you
know
everything
everything
i
want
details
his
voice
had
lost
the
tone
of
politeness
tinged
with
irony
which
he
adopted
toward
the
englishman
instead
it
rang
with
the
imperious
accent
of
the
master
who
is
accustomed
to
command
and
accustomed
to
see
every
one
bow
before
his
will
even
though
it
be
a
holmlock
shears
they
eyed
each
other
now
from
head
to
foot
as
enemies
declared
and
passionate
enemies
lupin
resumed
with
a
touch
of
nervousness
you
have
crossed
my
path
sir
on
several
occasions
each
occasion
has
been
one
too
many
and
i
am
tired
of
wasting
my
time
avoiding
the
traps
you
lay
for
me
i
warn
you
therefore
that
my
conduct
toward
you
will
depend
upon
your
answer
how
much
exactly
do
you
know
everything
i
tell
you
arsène
lupin
mastered
his
annoyance
and
jerked
out
i
will
tell
you
what
you
know
you
know
that
under
the
name
of
maxime
bermond
i
up
fifteen
houses
built
by
m
destange
yes
of
those
fifteen
houses
you
know
four
yes
and
you
have
a
list
of
the
eleven
others
yes
you
made
out
the
list
at
destange
last
night
no
doubt
yes
and
as
you
presume
that
among
those
eleven
properties
there
must
inevitably
be
one
which
i
keep
for
my
own
needs
and
those
of
my
friends
you
have
instructed
ganimard
to
take
the
field
and
discover
my
retreat
no
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
am
acting
alone
and
that
i
intended
to
take
the
field
alone
so
i
have
nothing
to
fear
seeing
that
i
have
you
in
my
hands
you
have
nothing
to
fear
so
long
as
i
in
your
hands
you
mean
to
say
that
you
will
not
remain
i
do
arsène
lupin
went
up
to
holmlock
shears
and
placed
his
hand
very
gently
on
the
englishman
shoulder
listen
to
me
sir
i
am
not
in
the
mood
for
argument
and
you
unfortunately
for
yourself
are
not
in
a
position
to
check
me
let
us
put
an
end
to
this
yes
let
us
you
shall
give
me
your
word
of
honour
not
to
attempt
to
escape
from
this
boat
until
she
reaches
english
waters
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
that
i
shall
attempt
to
escape
by
every
means
in
my
power
said
shears
nothing
daunted
but
dash
it
all
you
know
i
have
only
to
speak
a
word
to
reduce
you
to
helplessness
all
these
men
obey
me
blindly
at
a
sign
from
me
they
will
put
a
chain
round
your
neck
chains
can
be
broken
and
throw
you
overboard
at
ten
miles
from
the
coast
i
can
swim
well
said
cried
lupin
laughing
heaven
forgive
me
but
i
lost
my
temper
accept
my
apology
maître
and
let
us
conclude
will
you
allow
me
to
seek
the
necessary
measures
for
my
safety
and
that
of
my
friends
any
measures
you
like
but
they
are
useless
agreed
still
you
will
not
mind
if
i
take
them
it
your
duty
to
work
then
lupin
opened
the
door
and
called
the
captain
and
two
of
the
crew
the
latter
seized
the
englishman
and
after
searching
him
bound
his
legs
together
and
tied
him
down
in
the
captain
berth
that
will
do
ordered
lupin
really
sir
nothing
short
of
your
obstinancy
and
the
exceptional
gravity
of
the
circumstances
would
have
allowed
me
to
venture
the
sailors
withdrew
lupin
said
to
the
captain
captain
one
of
the
crew
must
remain
in
the
cabin
to
wait
on
shears
and
you
yourself
must
keep
him
company
as
much
as
you
can
let
him
be
treated
with
every
consideration
he
is
not
a
prisoner
but
a
guest
what
is
the
time
by
your
watch
captain
five
minutes
past
two
lupin
looked
at
his
own
watch
and
at
a
clock
which
hung
on
the
five
minutes
past
two
our
watches
agree
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
reach
southampton
nine
hours
without
hurrying
make
it
eleven
you
must
not
touch
land
before
the
departure
of
the
steamer
which
leaves
southampton
at
midnight
and
is
due
at
the
havre
at
eight
in
the
morning
you
understand
captain
do
you
not
i
repeat
it
would
be
exceedingly
dangerous
for
us
all
if
this
gentleman
returned
to
france
by
the
steamer
and
you
must
not
arrive
at
southampton
before
one
in
the
morning
very
well
sir
maître
said
lupin
turning
to
shears
we
shall
meet
next
year
in
this
world
or
another
let
say
a
few
minutes
later
shears
heard
the
car
drive
away
and
the
engines
of
the
at
once
began
to
throb
with
increased
force
the
yacht
threw
off
her
moorings
by
three
they
had
left
the
estuary
of
the
seine
and
entered
the
channel
at
that
moment
holmlock
shears
lay
sound
asleep
in
the
berth
to
which
he
was
fastened
down
on
the
following
morning
the
tenth
and
last
day
of
the

between
the
two
great
rivals
the

published
this
delicious
paragraph
a
decree
of
expulsion
was
pronounced
by
arsène
lupin
yesterday
against
holmlock
shears
the
english
detective
the
decree
was
published
at
noon
and
executed
on
the
same
day

was
landed
at
southampton
at
one
this
morning
chapter
vi
the
second
arrest
of
arsène
lupin
by
eight
on
wednesday
morning
a
dozen
pantechnicon
vans
were
blocking
the
rue
crevaux
from
the
avenue
du
bois
de
boulogne
to
the
avenue
bougeaud
félix
davey
was
leaving
the
flat
which
he
occupied
on
the
fourth
floor
of
no
and
by
a
sheer
coincidence
for
the
two
gentlemen
were
not
acquainted
dubreuil
the
expert
who
had
knocked
into
one
the
flat
of
no
and
the
flats
of
the
two
adjoining
houses
had
selected
the
same
day
on
which
to
send
off
the
collection
of
furniture
and
antiques
which
used
to
be
visited
daily
by
one
or
other
of
his
many
foreign
correspondents
a
peculiarity
which
attracted
notice
in
the
neighbourhood
but
which
was
not
mentioned
until
later
was
that
none
of
the
twelve
vans
bore
the
name
and
address
of
the
firm
of
removers
and
that
none
of
the
men
in
charge
of
them
loitered
in
the
round
about
they
worked
to
such
good
purpose
that
all
was
over
by
eleven
nothing
remained
but
those
piles
of
old
papers
and
rags
which
are
always
left
behind
in
the
corners
of
empty
rooms
félix
davey
was
a
young
man
of
smart
appearance
dressed
in
the
latest
fashion
but
carrying
a
cane
which
seemed
to
indicate
unusual
muscular
strength
on
the
part
of
its
owner
he
walked
away
quietly
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
in
the
cross
alley
which
intersects
the
avenue
du
bois
opposite
the
rue
pergolèse
beside
him
sat
a
young
woman
clad
in
the
costume
of
the
lower
and
reading
her
paper
while
a
child
played
with
its
spade
in
the
sand
beside
her
presently
félix
davey
said
to
the
woman
without
turning
his
head
ganimard
went
out
at
nine
this
morning
where
to
police
headquarters
alone
yes
no
telegram
last
night
no
do
they
still
trust
you
at
the
house
yes
i
do
odd
work
for
madame
ganimard
and
she
tells
me
all
her
husband
does
we
spent
the
morning
together
good
continue
to
come
here
at
eleven
every
morning
until
further
orders
he
rose
and
walked
to
the
pavillon
chinois
near
the
porte
dauphine
where
he
took
a
frugal
meal
two
eggs
some
vegetables
and
a
little
fruit
then
he
returned
to
the
rue
crevaux
and
said
to
the
concierge
i
am
going
to
have
a
look
round
upstairs
and
then
i
give
you
the
keys
he
finished
his
inspection
with
the
room
which
he
used
as
a
study
there
he
took
hold
of
the
end
of
a
jointed
which
was
fixed
beside
the
chimney
unscrewed
the
brass
nozzle
fitted
a
little
instrument
to
it
and
blew
up
the
pipe
a
faint
whistle
sounded
in
reply
putting
the
pipe
to
his
mouth
he
whispered
any
one
there
dubreuil
no
can
i
come
up
yes
he
replaced
the
bracket
saying
as
he
did
so
where
will
progress
stop
our
age
teems
with
little
inventions
that
make
life
really
charming
and
picturesque
and
so
amusing
too
especially
when
a
man
knows
the
game
of
life
as
i
know
it
he
touched
one
of
the
marble
mouldings
of
the
and
made
it
swing
round
on
a
pivot
the
marble
slab
itself
moved
and
the
mirror
above
it
slid
between
invisible
grooves
revealing
a
yawning
gap
which
contained
the
lower
steps
of
a
staircase
built
in
the
body
of
the
chimney
itself
it
was
all
very
clean
in
iron
and
white
porcelain
tiles
he
climbed
up
to
the
fifth
floor
which
had
a
similar
opening
over
the
and
found
dubreuil
awaiting
him
is
everything
finished
here
everything
all
cleared
up
quite
the
staff
all
gone
except
the
three
men
keeping
watch
let
go
up
they
climbed
by
the
same
way
to
the
servants
floor
and
emerged
in
a
garret
where
they
found
three
men
one
of
whom
was
looking
out
of
the
window
any
news
no
governor
is
the
street
quiet
absolutely
i
shall
leave
for
good
in
ten
minutes
you
will
go
too
in
the
meantime
if
you
notice
the
least
suspicious
movement
in
the
street
let
me
know
i
got
my
finger
on
the
governor
dubreuil
did
you
remember
to
tell
the
removers
not
to
touch
the
yes
they
work
perfectly
that
all
right
then
the
two
gentlemen
returned
to
félix
davey
flat
and
davey
after
readjusting
the
marble
moulding
exclaimed
gaily
dubreuil
i
should
love
to
see
the
faces
of
those
who
discover
all
these
wonderful
contrivances
a
network
of
electric
wires
and
invisible
passages
sliding
secret
staircases
regular
pantomime
machinery
what
an
advertisement
for
arsène
lupin
we
could
very
well
have
done
without
the
advertisement
it
seems
a
pity
to
leave
so
fine
an
installation
we
shall
have
to
begin
all
over
again
dubreuil
and
upon
a
new
plan
of
course
for
it
never
does
to
repeat
one
self
confound
that
shears
he
not
come
back
i
suppose
how
could
he
there
only
one
boat
from
southampton
which
leaves
at
midnight
from
the
havre
there
only
one
train
which
leaves
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
arrives
at
eleven
three
once
he
has
not
taken
the
midnight
steamer
and
he
has
not
for
my
orders
to
the
captain
were
formal
he
ca
reach
france
till
this
evening
newhaven
and
dieppe
if
he
comes
back
shears
never
throws
up
the
game
he
will
come
back
but
it
will
be
too
late
we
shall
be
far
away
and
mlle
destange
i
am
to
meet
her
in
an
hour
at
her
house
no
she
wo
go
home
for
a
few
days
until
the
storm
has
blown
over
and
i
am
able
to
look
after
her
more
thoroughly
but
you
must
hurry
dubreuil
it
will
take
a
long
time
to
ship
all
the
cases
and
you
will
be
wanted
on
the
wharf
you
sure
we
are
not
being
watched
whom
by
i
was
never
afraid
of
any
one
but
shears
dubreuil
went
away
félix
davey
took
a
last
walk
round
the
flat
picked
up
a
torn
letter
or
two
and
then
seeing
a
piece
of
chalk
he
took
it
drew
a
large
circle
on
the
dark
of
the
dining
room
and
wrote
after
the
style
of
a
commemorative
tablet
arsène
lupin
gentleman
burglar
lived
here
for
years
at
the
commencement
of
the
twentieth
century
this
little
joke
seemed
to
cause
him
a
lively
satisfaction
he
whistled
gaily
as
he
looked
at
it
and
cried
now
that
i
have
put
myself
right
with
the
historians
of
the
future
generations
let
be
off
hurry
up
maître
holmlock
shears
in
three
minutes
i
shall
have
left
my
lair
and
your
defeat
will
be
absolute
two
minutes
more
you
keeping
me
waiting
maître
one
minute
more
are
you
coming
very
well
i
proclaim
your
downfall
and
my
apotheosis
with
which
last
words
i
proceed
to
make
myself
scarce
farewell
o
kingdom
of
arsène
lupin
i
shall
not
look
upon
you
again
farewell
ye
rooms
of
the
six
flats
over
which
i
reigned
farewell
austere
and
humble
dwelling
a
bell
cut
short
his
lyrical
effusion
a
short
shrill
strident
bell
twice
interrupted
twice
resumed
and
then
ceasing
it
was
the
what
could
it
mean
some
unexpected
danger
ganimard
surely
not
he
was
on
the
point
of
making
for
his
study
and
escaping
but
first
he
turned
to
the
window
there
was
no
one
in
the
street
was
the
enemy
already
in
the
house
then
he
listened
and
seemed
to
distinguish
confused
sounds
without
further
hesitation
he
ran
to
his
study
and
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
heard
the
sound
of
a
latchkey
fumbling
at
the
lock
of
the
by
jove
he
muttered
i
have
only
just
time
the
house
may
be
surrounded
no
use
trying
the
servants
staircase
fortunately
the
chimney
he
pushed
the
moulding
smartly
it
did
not
move
he
exerted
greater
force
it
did
not
move
at
the
same
moment
he
received
the
impression
that
the
outer
door
was
opening
and
that
steps
sounded
curse
it
all
he
swore
i
lost
if
this
confounded
spring
his
fingers
clutched
the
moulding
he
bore
upon
it
with
all
his
weight
nothing
moved
nothing
by
some
incredible
bad
luck
by
a
really
bewildering
piece
of
malice
on
the
part
of
fate
the
spring
which
was
working
only
a
moment
before
now
refused
to
work
he
persisted
madly
convulsively
the
block
of
marble
remained
inert
motionless
curse
it
was
it
conceivable
that
this
stupid
obstacle
should
bar
his
way
he
struck
the
marble
struck
it
furious
blows
with
his
fists
hammered
it
insulted
it
why
lupin
is
something
not
going
as
you
wish
lupin
turned
round
holmlock
shears
stood
before
him
holmlock
shears
lupin
gazed
at
him
blinking
his
eyes
as
though
smarting
under
a
cruel
vision
holmlock
shears
in
paris
holmlock
shears
whom
he
had
packed
off
to
england
the
day
before
as
he
might
a
compromising
parcel
stood
there
before
him
triumphant
and
free
ah
for
this
impossible
miracle
to
be
performed
in
despite
of
arsène
will
there
must
have
been
a
revolution
of
the
laws
of
nature
a
victory
of
all
that
is
illogical
and
abnormal
holmlock
shears
standing
opposite
him
and
the
englishman
resorting
to
irony
in
his
turn
said
with
that
supercilious
politeness
with
which
his
adversary
had
so
often
lashed
him
lupin
believe
me
from
this
minute
i
shall
cease
to
remember
the
night
you
made
me
spend
in
baron
house
cease
to
remember
my
friend
wilson
mishaps
cease
to
remember
how
i
was
kidnapped
by
cease
to
remember
the
which
i
have
just
taken
fastened
down
by
your
orders
to
an
uncomfortable
berth
this
minute
wipes
out
all
i
forget
everything
i
am
rewarded
amply
rewarded
lupin
did
not
speak
the
englishman
added
do
you
think
so
yourself
he
appeared
to
be
insisting
as
though
demanding
an
assent
a
sort
of
receipt
with
regard
to
the
past
after
a
moment
reflection
during
which
the
englishman
felt
himself
searched
and
fathomed
to
the
very
bottom
of
his
soul
lupin
said
i
presume
sir
that
your
present
action
rests
upon
serious
motives
extremely
serious
motives
the
fact
of
your
escaping
from
my
captain
and
his
crew
is
only
a
secondary
incident
in
our
struggle
but
the
fact
of
your
being
here
before
me
alone
do
you
understand
in
the
presence
of
arsène
lupin
makes
me
believe
that
your
revenge
is
as
complete
as
possible
it
is
as
complete
as
possible
this
house
surrounded
the
two
next
houses
surrounded
the
flat
above
this
the
three
flats
on
the
fifth
floor
which
were
occupied
by
dubreuil
are
invested
so
that
so
that
you
are
caught
lupin
irredeemably
caught
lupin
now
experienced
the
same
feelings
that
had
stirred
shears
during
his
drive
the
same
concentrated
rage
the
same
rebellion
but
also
when
all
was
said
and
done
the
same
sense
of
loyalty
which
compelled
him
to
bow
before
the
force
of
circumstances
both
were
equally
strong
both
alike
were
bound
to
accept
defeat
as
a
temporary
evil
to
be
received
with
resignation
we
are
quits
sir
he
said
bluntly
the
englishman
seemed
delighted
at
this
confession
the
two
men
were
silent
then
lupin
already
master
of
himself
resumed
with
a
smile
and
i
am
not
sorry
it
was
becoming
wearisome
to
win
every
thrust
i
had
only
to
put
out
my
arm
to
hit
you
full
in
the
chest
this
time
you
score
one
well
hit
maître
he
laughed
at
last
we
shall
have
some
fun
lupin
is
caught
in
the
trap
how
will
he
get
out
caught
in
the
trap
what
an
adventure
ah
maître
i
have
to
thank
you
for
a
grand
emotion
this
is
what
i
call
life
he
pressed
his
clenched
fists
to
his
temples
as
though
to
restrain
the
ungovernable
joy
that
was
bubbling
up
within
him
and
he
also
had
gestures
like
those
of
a
child
amusing
itself
beyond
its
power
of
endurance
at
last
he
went
up
to
the
englishman
and
now
what
are
you
here
for
what
am
i
here
for
yes
ganimard
is
outside
with
his
men
why
does
he
not
come
in
i
asked
him
not
to
and
he
consented
i
called
in
his
services
only
on
the
express
condition
that
he
would
be
led
by
me
besides
he
believes
that
félix
davey
is
merely
an
accomplice
of
lupin
then
i
will
repeat
my
question
under
another
form
why
did
you
come
in
alone
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
first
aha
you
want
to
speak
to
me
the
idea
seemed
to
please
lupin
greatly
there
are
circumstances
in
life
in
which
we
much
prefer
words
to
deeds
shears
i
am
sorry
not
to
have
a
chair
to
offer
you
does
this
broken
box
suit
you
or
the
i
am
sure
a
glass
of
beer
would
be
acceptable
do
you
like
it
light
or
dark
but
do
sit
down
i
beg
never
mind
that
let
us
talk
i
am
listening
i
shall
not
be
long
the
object
of
my
stay
in
france
was
not
to
effect
your
arrest
i
was
obliged
to
pursue
you
because
no
other
means
offered
of
attaining
my
real
object
which
was
to
recover
the
blue
diamond
the
blue
diamond
certainly
because
the
one
discovered
in
herr
bleichen
flask
was
not
the
real
one
just
so
the
real
one
was
posted
by
the
blonde
lady
i
had
an
exact
copy
made
and
as
at
that
time
i
had
designs
upon
the
comtesse
de
crozon
other
jewels
and
as
the
austrian
consul
was
already
under
suspicion
the
aforesaid
blonde
lady
lest
she
should
be
suspected
in
her
turn
slipped
the
imitation
diamond
into
the
aforesaid
luggage
while
you
kept
the
real
one
quite
right
i
want
that
diamond
impossible
i
sorry
i
have
promised
it
to
the
comtesse
de
crozon
i
mean
to
have
it
how
can
you
have
it
seeing
that
it
in
my
possession
i
mean
to
have
it
just
because
it
is
in
your
possession
you
mean
that
i
shall
give
it
back
to
you
yes
voluntarily
i
will
buy
it
of
you
lupin
had
a
fit
of
merriment
any
one
can
tell
what
country
come
from
you
treat
this
as
a
matter
of
business
it
is
a
matter
of
business
and
what
price
do
you
offer
the
liberty
of
mlle
destange
her
liberty
but
i
am
not
aware
that
she
is
under
arrest
i
shall
give
ganimard
the
necessary
information
once
deprived
of
your
protection
she
will
be
taken
also
lupin
burst
out
laughing
again
my
dear
sir
you
are
offering
me
what
you
do
not
possess
mlle
destange
is
safe
and
fears
nothing
i
want
something
else
the
englishman
hesitated
obviously
embarrassed
and
flushing
slightly
then
he
put
his
hand
brusquely
on
his
adversary
shoulder
and
if
i
offered
you
my
liberty
no
but
still
i
might
leave
the
room
to
arrange
with
ganimard
and
leave
me
to
think
things
over
yes
well
what
on
earth
would
be
the
good
of
that
this
confounded
spring
wo
work
said
lupin
irritably
pushing
the
moulding
of
the
mantel
he
stifled
an
exclamation
of
surprise
this
time
freakish
chance
had
willed
that
the
block
of
marble
should
move
under
his
fingers
safety
flight
became
possible
in
that
case
why
submit
to
holmlock
conditions
he
walked
to
and
fro
as
though
reflecting
upon
his
answer
then
he
in
his
turn
put
his
hand
on
the
englishman
shoulder
after
due
consideration
shears
i
prefer
to
settle
my
little
affairs
alone
still
no
i
do
want
anybody
help
when
ganimard
has
you
it
will
be
up
with
you
they
wo
let
you
go
again
who
knows
come
this
is
madness
every
outlet
is
watched
one
remains
which
one
the
one
i
shall
select
words
your
arrest
may
be
looked
upon
as
effected
it
is
not
effected
so
so
i
shall
keep
the
blue
diamond
shears
took
out
his
watch
it
is
ten
minutes
to
three
at
three
i
call
ganimard
that
gives
us
ten
minutes
to
chat
in
let
us
make
the
most
of
our
time
shears
and
tell
me
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
by
which
i
am
devoured
how
did
you
procure
my
address
and
my
name
of
félix
davey
keeping
a
watchful
eye
on
lupin
whose
made
him
feel
uneasy
shears
gladly
consented
to
give
this
little
explanation
which
flattered
his
vanity
and
said
i
had
your
address
from
the
blonde
lady
clotilde
yes
you
remember
yesterday
morning
when
i
meant
to
carry
her
off
in
the
she
telephoned
to
her
dressmaker
so
she
did
well
i
understood
later
that
the
dressmaker
was
yourself
and
last
night
in
the
boat
thanks
to
an
effort
of
memory
which
is
perhaps
one
of
the
things
of
which
i
am
most
proud
i
succeeded
in
recollecting
the
last
two
figures
of
your
telephone
number
in
this
way
as
i
possessed
the
list
of
the
houses
which
you
had
up
it
was
easy
for
me
on
my
arrival
in
paris
at
eleven
this
morning
to
look
through
the
telephone
directory
until
i
discovered
the
name
and
address
of
félix
davey
the
name
and
address
once
known
i
called
in
the
aid
of
m
ganimard
admirable
i
make
you
my
bow
but
what
i
ca
quite
grasp
is
that
you
took
the
train
at
the
havre
how
did
you
manage
to
escape
from
the
i
did
not
escape
but
you
gave
the
captain
orders
not
to
reach
southampton
until
one
well
they
landed
me
at
twelve
and
i
caught
the
havre
boat
the
captain
played
me
false
impossible
he
did
not
play
you
false
what
then
it
was
his
watch
his
watch
yes
i
put
his
watch
on
an
hour
how
the
only
way
in
which
one
can
put
a
watch
on
by
turning
the
winder
we
were
sitting
together
chatting
and
i
told
him
things
that
interested
him
by
jove
he
noticed
nothing
well
done
well
done
it
a
good
trick
and
i
must
remember
it
but
what
about
the
cabin
clock
oh
the
clock
was
more
difficult
for
my
legs
were
bound
but
the
sailor
who
was
put
in
charge
of
me
whenever
the
captain
went
on
deck
kindly
consented
to
give
the
hands
a
push
the
sailor
nonsense
do
you
mean
to
say
he
consented
oh
he
did
not
know
the
importance
of
what
he
was
doing
i
told
him
i
must
at
all
costs
catch
the
first
train
to
london
and
he
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
in
consideration
in
consideration
of
a
little
present
which
the
decent
fellow
however
intends
faithfully
to
send
to
you
what
present
a
mere
nothing
well
but
what
the
blue
diamond
the
blue
diamond
yes
the
imitation
one
which
you
substituted
for
the
diamond
and
which
she
left
in
my
hands
arsène
lupin
gave
a
sudden
and
tumultuous
burst
of
laughter
he
seemed
ready
to
die
his
eyes
were
wet
with
tears
oh
what
a
joke
my
faked
diamond
handed
back
to
the
sailor
and
the
captain
watch
and
the
hands
of
the
clock
never
before
had
holmlock
shears
felt
the
struggle
between
arsène
lupin
and
himself
grow
so
intense
as
now
with
his
prodigious
intuition
he
guessed
that
under
this
excessive
gaiety
lupin
was
concentrating
his
formidable
mind
and
collecting
all
his
faculties
lupin
had
gradually
drawn
closer
the
englishman
stepped
back
and
slipped
his
fingers
as
though
into
his
pocket
it
three
m
lupin
three
already
what
a
pity
we
were
having
such
fun
i
am
waiting
for
your
answer
my
answer
goodness
me
what
a
lot
you
want
so
this
finishes
the
game
with
my
liberty
for
the
stakes
or
the
blue
diamond
very
well
it
your
lead
what
do
you
do
i
mark
the
king
said
shears
firing
a
shot
with
his
revolver
and
here
retorted
arsène
hurling
his
fist
at
the
englishman
shears
had
fired
at
the
ceiling
to
summon
ganimard
the
need
for
whose
intervention
now
seemed
urgent
but
arsène
fist
caught
him
full
in
the
wind
and
he
turned
pale
and
staggered
back
lupin
gave
one
bound
toward
the
chimney
and
the
marble
slab
moved
too
late
the
door
opened
surrender
lupin
if
not
ganimard
who
had
doubtless
been
posted
nearer
than
lupin
thought
stood
there
with
his
revolver
aimed
at
him
and
behind
ganimard
ten
men
twenty
men
crowded
upon
one
another
heels
powerful
ruthless
fellows
prepared
to
beat
lupin
down
like
a
dog
at
the
least
sign
of
resistance
he
made
a
quiet
gesture
hands
off
there
i
surrender
and
he
crossed
his
arms
over
his
chest
a
sort
of
stupor
followed
in
the
room
stripped
of
its
furniture
and
hangings
arsène
lupin
words
seemed
like
an
echo
i
surrender
the
words
sounded
incredible
the
others
were
expecting
to
see
him
vanish
suddenly
down
a
trap
or
a
panel
of
the
wall
to
fall
back
and
once
more
to
hide
him
from
his
assailants
and
he
surrendered
ganimard
stepped
forward
and
greatly
excited
with
all
the
gravity
that
the
act
demanded
brought
his
hand
slowly
down
upon
his
shoulder
and
enjoyed
the
infinite
satisfaction
of
saying
lupin
i
arrest
you
brrrrr
shivered
lupin
you
make
me
feel
quite
overcome
my
dear
ganimard
what
a
solemn
face
one
would
think
you
were
making
a
speech
over
a
friend
grave
come
drop
these
funereal
airs
i
arrest
you
you
seem
quite
flabbergasted
in
the
name
of
the
law
of
which
he
is
a
faithful
limb
ganimard
arrests
wicked
arsène
lupin
it
is
an
historic
moment
and
you
grasp
its
full
importance
and
this
is
the
second
time
a
similar
fact
occurs
bravo
ganimard
you
will
do
well
in
your
career
and
he
held
out
his
wrists
for
the
handcuffs
they
were
fastened
on
almost
solemnly
the
detectives
in
spite
of
their
usual
roughness
and
the
bitterness
of
their
resentment
against
lupin
acted
with
reserve
and
discretion
astounded
as
they
were
at
being
allowed
to
touch
that
intangible
being
my
poor
lupin
he
sighed
what
would
your
smart
friends
say
if
they
saw
you
humbled
like
this
he
separated
his
wrists
with
a
growing
and
continuous
effort
of
every
muscle
the
veins
on
his
forehead
swelled
the
links
of
the
chain
dug
into
his
skin
now
then
he
said
the
chain
snapped
and
broke
in
two
another
mates
this
one
no
good
they
put
two
pairs
on
him
he
approved
that
better
you
ca
be
too
careful
then
counting
the
detectives
he
continued
how
many
of
you
are
there
my
friends
thirty
that
a
lot
i
ca
do
anything
against
thirty
ah
if
there
had
been
only
fifteen
of
you
he
really
had
a
manner
about
him
the
manner
of
a
great
actor
playing
his
instinctive
spirited
part
impertinently
and
frivolously
shears
watched
him
as
a
man
watches
a
fine
sight
of
which
he
is
able
to
appreciate
every
beauty
and
every
shade
and
he
absolutely
received
the
strange
impression
that
the
struggle
was
an
equal
one
between
those
thirty
men
on
the
one
hand
backed
up
by
all
the
formidable
machinery
of
the
law
and
that
single
being
on
the
other
fettered
and
unarmed
the
two
sides
were
evenly
matched
well
maître
said
lupin
this
is
your
work
thanks
to
you
lupin
is
going
to
rot
on
the
damp
straw
of
the
cells
confess
that
your
conscience
is
not
quite
easy
and
that
you
feel
the
pangs
of
remorse
the
englishman
gave
an
involuntary
shrug
as
though
to
say
you
had
the
chance
never
never
exclaimed
lupin
give
you
back
the
blue
diamond
ah
no
it
has
cost
me
too
much
trouble
already
i
value
it
you
see
at
the
first
visit
i
have
the
honour
of
paying
you
in
london
next
month
i
daresay
i
will
tell
you
why
but
shall
you
be
in
london
next
month
would
you
rather
i
met
you
in
vienna
or
st
petersburg
he
started
suddenly
an
electric
bell
rang
just
below
the
ceiling
and
this
time
it
was
not
the
but
the
bell
of
the
telephone
which
had
not
been
removed
and
which
stood
between
the
two
windows
the
telephone
ah
who
was
going
to
fall
into
the
trap
laid
by
an
odious
chance
arsène
lupin
made
a
furious
move
toward
the
instrument
as
though
he
would
have
smashed
it
to
atoms
and
in
so
doing
stifled
the
unknown
voice
that
wished
to
speak
to
him
but
ganimard
took
the
receiver
from
its
hook
and
bent
down
hullo
hullo
yes
that
right
with
a
brisk
gesture
of
authority
shears
pushed
him
aside
took
the
two
receivers
and
put
his
handkerchief
over
the
mouthpiece
to
make
the
sound
of
his
voice
less
distinct
at
that
moment
he
glanced
at
lupin
and
the
look
which
they
exchanged
showed
them
that
the
same
thought
had
struck
them
both
and
that
they
both
foresaw
to
the
end
the
consequences
of
that
possible
probable
almost
certain
supposition
it
was
the
blonde
lady
telephoning
she
thought
that
she
was
telephoning
to
félix
davey
or
rather
maxime
bermond
and
she
was
about
to
confide
in
holmlock
shears
and
the
englishman
repeated
hullo
hullo
a
pause
and
shears
yes
it
i
maxime
the
drama
took
shape
forthwith
with
tragic
precision
lupin
the
mocking
indomitable
lupin
no
longer
even
thought
of
concealing
his
anxiety
and
with
features
pale
as
death
strove
to
hear
to
guess
and
shears
continued
in
reply
to
the
mysterious
voice
yes
yes
it
all
finished
and
i
was
just
getting
ready
to
come
on
to
you
as
arranged
where
why
where
you
are
is
that
best
he
hesitated
seeking
his
words
and
then
stopped
it
was
evident
that
he
was
trying
to
draw
out
the
girl
without
saying
too
much
himself
and
that
he
had
not
the
least
idea
where
she
was
besides
presence
seemed
to
hinder
him
oh
if
some
miracle
could
have
cut
the
thread
of
that
diabolical
conversation
lupin
called
for
it
with
all
his
might
with
all
his
strained
nerves
and
shears
went
on
hullo
hullo
ca
you
hear
it
very
bad
at
this
end
too
and
i
can
hardly
make
out
can
you
hear
me
now
well
on
second
thoughts
you
had
better
go
home
oh
no
there
no
danger
at
all
why
he
in
england
i
had
a
telegram
from
southampton
the
irony
of
the
words
shears
uttered
them
with
an
inexpressible
sense
of
satisfaction
and
he
added
so
go
at
once
dear
and
i
shall
be
with
you
soon
he
hung
up
the
receivers
ganimard
i
propose
to
borrow
three
of
your
men
it
for
the
blonde
lady
i
suppose
yes
do
you
know
who
she
is
where
she
is
yes
by
jove
a
fine
capture
she
and
lupin
that
completes
the
work
folenfant
take
two
men
and
go
with
mr
shears
the
englishman
walked
away
followed
by
the
three
detectives
the
end
had
come
the
blonde
lady
also
was
about
to
fall
into
hands
thanks
to
his
wonderful
persistency
thanks
to
the
aid
of
fortunate
events
the
battle
was
turning
to
victory
for
him
and
irreparable
disaster
for
lupin
mr
shears
the
englishman
stopped
yes
m
lupin
lupin
seemed
completely
crushed
by
this
last
blow
his
forehead
was
wrinkled
he
was
and
gloomy
yet
he
drew
himself
up
with
a
revival
of
energy
and
in
spite
of
all
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
glad
unconcern
you
must
admit
that
fate
is
dead
against
me
just
now
it
prevented
me
from
escaping
by
the
chimney
and
delivered
me
into
your
hands
this
moment
it
has
made
use
of
the
telephone
to
make
you
a
present
of
the
blonde
lady
i
bow
before
its
decrees
meaning
meaning
that
i
am
prepared
to
reopen
negotiations
shears
took
the
inspector
aside
and
begged
permission
but
in
a
tone
that
allowed
of
no
refusal
to
exchange
a
few
words
with
lupin
then
he
walked
across
to
him
the
momentous
conversation
took
place
it
opened
in
short
nervous
phrases
what
do
you
want
mlle
destange
liberty
you
know
the
price
yes
and
you
agree
i
agree
to
all
your
conditions
ah
exclaimed
the
astonished
englishman
but
you
refused
just
now
for
yourself
it
was
a
question
of
myself
shears
now
it
involves
a
woman
and
a
woman
whom
i
love
you
see
we
have
very
peculiar
ideas
about
these
things
in
france
and
it
does
not
follow
that
because
a
name
is
lupin
he
will
act
differently
on
the
contrary
he
said
this
quite
simply
shears
gave
him
an
imperceptible
nod
and
whispered
where
is
the
blue
diamond
take
my
cane
over
there
in
the
chimney
corner
hold
the
knob
in
one
hand
and
turn
the
iron
ferrule
with
the
other
shears
took
the
cane
turned
the
ferrule
and
as
he
turned
it
perceived
that
the
knob
became
unscrewed
inside
the
knob
was
a
ball
of
putty
inside
the
putty
a
diamond
he
examined
it
it
was
the
blue
diamond
mlle
destange
is
free
m
lupin
free
in
the
future
as
in
the
present
she
has
nothing
to
fear
from
you
nor
from
any
one
else
whatever
happens
whatever
happens
i
have
forgotten
her
name
and
where
she
lives
thank
you
and
for
we
shall
meet
again
shears
shall
we
not
i
have
no
doubt
we
shall
a
more
or
less
heated
explanation
followed
between
the
englishman
and
ganimard
and
was
cut
short
by
shears
with
a
certain
roughness
i
am
very
sorry
ganimard
that
i
ca
agree
with
you
but
i
have
no
time
to
persuade
you
now
i
leave
for
england
in
an
hour
but
the
blonde
lady
i
know
no
such
person
only
a
moment
ago
you
must
take
it
or
leave
it
i
have
already
caught
lupin
for
you
here
is
the
blue
diamond
which
you
may
have
the
pleasure
of
handing
to
the
countess
yourself
i
ca
see
that
you
have
anything
to
complain
of
but
the
blonde
lady
find
her
he
settled
his
hat
on
his
head
and
walked
away
with
a
brisk
step
like
a
gentleman
who
has
no
time
to
loiter
once
his
business
is
done
maître
cried
lupin
and
a
pleasant
journey
i
shall
always
remember
the
cordial
relations
between
us
my
kind
regards
to
mr
wilson
he
received
no
reply
and
chuckled
that
what
we
call
taking
english
leave
ah
those
worthy
islanders
do
not
possess
that
elegant
courtesy
which
distinguishes
us
just
think
ganimard
of
the
exit
which
a
frenchman
would
have
made
in
similar
circumstances
under
what
exquisite
politeness
would
he
not
have
concealed
his
triumph
but
lord
bless
my
soul
ganimard
what
are
you
doing
well
i
never
a
search
but
there
nothing
left
my
poor
friend
not
a
scrap
of
paper
my
archives
have
been
moved
to
a
place
of
safety
one
can
never
tell
lupin
looked
on
in
resignation
held
by
two
inspectors
and
surrounded
by
all
the
rest
he
patiently
watched
the
various
operations
but
after
twenty
minutes
he
sighed
come
along
ganimard
you
never
be
finished
at
this
rate
are
you
in
a
great
hurry
yes
i
should
think
i
was
i
have
an
important
engagement
at
the
no
in
town
tut
tut
at
what
time
at
two
it
past
three
exactly
i
shall
be
late
and
there
nothing
i
detest
so
much
as
being
late
will
you
give
me
five
minutes
not
a
minute
longer
you
too
good
i
try
do
talk
so
much
what
that
cupboard
too
why
it
empty
there
are
some
letters
for
all
that
old
bills
no
a
bundle
done
up
in
ribbon
a
pink
ribbon
is
it
oh
ganimard
do
untie
it
for
heaven
sake
are
they
from
a
woman
yes
a
lady
rather
what
her
name
mme
ganimard
very
witty
oh
very
witty
cried
the
inspector
in
an
affected
tone
at
that
moment
the
men
returned
from
the
other
rooms
and
declared
that
their
search
had
led
to
nothing
lupin
began
to
laugh
of
course
not
did
you
expect
to
find
a
list
of
my
friends
or
a
proof
of
my
relations
with
the
german
emperor
what
you
ought
to
have
looked
for
ganimard
are
the
little
mysteries
of
this
flat
for
instance
that
is
a
speaking
tube
the
chimney
contains
a
staircase
this
wall
here
is
hollow
and
such
a
tangle
of
look
here
ganimard
just
press
that
button
ganimard
did
as
he
was
asked
did
you
hear
anything
no
nor
i
and
yet
you
have
instructed
the
captain
of
my
to
get
ready
the
airship
which
is
soon
to
carry
us
up
to
the
sky
come
said
ganimard
who
had
finished
his
inspection
enough
of
this
nonsense
let
us
start
he
took
a
few
steps
followed
by
his
men
lupin
did
not
budge
a
foot
breadth
his
custodians
pushed
him
in
vain
well
said
ganimard
do
you
refuse
to
come
not
at
all
then
it
all
depends
depends
on
what
on
where
you
taking
me
to
the
of
course
then
i
sha
come
i
have
nothing
to
do
at
the
station
you
mad
did
i
tell
you
i
had
an
important
engagement
lupin
come
ganimard
the
blonde
lady
must
be
getting
quite
anxious
about
me
and
do
you
think
i
could
have
the
rudeness
to
keep
her
waiting
it
would
not
be
the
conduct
of
a
gentleman
listen
to
me
lupin
said
the
inspector
who
was
beginning
to
lose
his
temper
under
all
this
chaff
so
far
i
have
treated
you
with
excessive
consideration
but
there
are
limits
follow
me
impossible
i
have
an
engagement
and
that
engagement
i
mean
to
keep
for
the
last
time
ganimard
made
a
sign
two
men
seized
lupin
under
the
arms
and
lifted
him
from
the
floor
but
they
dropped
him
at
once
with
howls
of
pain
with
his
two
hands
arsène
lupin
had
dug
two
long
needles
into
their
flesh
maddened
with
rage
the
others
rushed
upon
him
wreaking
their
hatred
at
last
burning
to
avenge
their
comrades
and
themselves
for
the
numberless
affronts
put
upon
them
and
they
rained
a
shower
of
blows
upon
his
body
one
blow
more
violent
than
the
rest
struck
him
on
the
temple
he
fell
to
the
floor
if
you
hurt
him
growled
ganimard
angrily
you
have
me
to
deal
with
he
bent
over
lupin
prepared
to
assist
him
but
finding
that
he
was
breathing
freely
he
told
the
men
to
take
lupin
by
the
head
and
feet
while
he
himself
supported
his
hips
slowly
now
gently
do
jolt
him
why
you
brutes
you
might
have
killed
him
well
lupin
how
do
you
feel
lupin
opened
his
eyes
and
stammered
not
up
to
much
ganimard
you
should
have
let
them
knock
me
about
dash
it
it
your
own
fault
with
your
obstinacy
replied
ganimard
in
real
distress
but
you
not
hurt
they
reached
the
landing
lupin
moaned
ganimard
the
lift
they
break
my
bones
good
idea
capital
idea
agreed
the
inspector
besides
the
stairs
are
so
narrow
it
would
be
impossible
he
got
the
lift
up
they
laid
lupin
on
the
seat
with
every
imaginable
precaution
ganimard
sat
down
beside
him
and
said
to
his
men
go
down
the
stairs
at
once
wait
for
me
by
the
porter
lodge
do
you
understand
he
shut
the
door
but
it
was
hardly
closed
when
shouts
arose
the
lift
had
shot
up
like
a
balloon
with
its
rope
cut
a
sardonic
laugh
rang
out
damnation
roared
ganimard
feeling
frantically
in
the
dark
for
the
lever
and
failing
to
find
it
he
shouted
the
fifth
floor
watch
the
door
on
the
fifth
floor
the
detectives
rushed
upstairs
four
steps
at
a
time
but
a
strange
thing
happened
the
lift
seemed
to
shoot
right
through
the
ceiling
of
the
top
floor
disappeared
before
the
detectives
eyes
and
suddenly
emerged
on
the
upper
story
where
the
servants
bedrooms
were
and
stopped
three
men
were
in
waiting
and
opened
the
door
two
of
them
overpowered
ganimard
who
hampered
in
his
movements
and
completely
bewildered
hardly
thought
of
defending
himself
the
third
helped
lupin
out
i
told
you
ganimard
carried
off
by
balloon
and
thanks
to
you
next
time
you
must
show
less
compassion
and
above
all
remember
that
arsène
lupin
does
not
allow
himself
to
be
bashed
and
mauled
about
without
good
reasons
the
was
already
closed
and
the
lift
with
ganimard
inside
sent
back
on
its
journey
toward
the
ground
floor
and
all
this
was
done
so
expeditiously
that
the
old
detective
caught
up
his
subordinates
at
the
door
of
the
porter
lodge
without
a
word
they
hurried
across
the
courtyard
and
up
the
staircase
the
only
means
of
communication
with
the
floor
by
which
the
escape
had
been
effected
a
long
passage
with
many
windings
lined
with
small
numbered
rooms
led
to
a
door
which
had
been
simply
left
ajar
beyond
this
door
and
consequently
in
another
house
was
another
passage
also
with
a
number
of
turns
and
lined
with
similar
rooms
right
at
the
end
was
a
staircase
ganimard
went
down
it
crossed
a
yard
a
hall
and
rushed
into
a
street
the
rue
picot
then
he
understood
the
two
houses
were
built
back
to
back
and
their
fronts
faced
two
streets
running
not
at
right
angles
but
parallel
with
a
distance
of
over
sixty
yards
between
them
he
entered
the
porter
lodge
and
showed
his
card
have
four
men
just
gone
out
yes
the
two
servants
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
floors
with
two
friends
who
lives
on
the
fourth
and
fifth
floors
two
gentlemen
of
the
name
of
fauvel
and
their
cousins
the
provosts
they
moved
this
morning
only
the
two
servants
remained
they
have
just
gone
ah
thought
ganimard
sinking
on
to
a
sofa
in
the
lodge
what
a
fine
stroke
we
have
missed
the
whole
gang
occupied
this
forty
minutes
later
two
gentlemen
drove
up
in
a
cab
to
the
gare
du
nord
and
hurried
toward
the
calais
express
followed
by
a
porter
carrying
their
bags
one
of
them
had
his
arm
in
a
sling
and
his
face
was
pale
and
drawn
the
other
seemed
in
great
spirits
come
along
wilson
it
wo
do
to
miss
the
train
oh
wilson
i
shall
never
forget
these
ten
days
no
more
shall
i
what
a
fine
series
of
battles
magnificent
a
regrettable
incident
here
and
there
but
of
very
slight
importance
very
slight
as
you
say
and
lastly
victory
all
along
the
line
lupin
arrested
the
blue
diamond
recovered
my
arm
broken
with
a
success
of
this
kind
what
does
a
broken
arm
matter
especially
mine
especially
yours
remember
wilson
it
was
at
the
very
moment
when
you
were
at
the
chemist
suffering
like
a
hero
that
i
discovered
the
clue
that
guided
me
through
the
darkness
what
a
piece
of
luck
the
doors
were
being
locked
take
your
seats
please
hurry
up
gentlemen
the
porter
climbed
into
an
empty
compartment
and
placed
the
bags
in
the
rack
while
shears
hoisted
the
unfortunate
wilson
in
what
are
you
doing
wilson
hurry
up
old
chap
pull
yourself
together
do
it
not
for
want
of
pulling
myself
together
what
then
i
can
only
use
one
hand
well
cried
shears
gaily
what
a
fuss
you
make
one
would
think
you
were
the
only
man
in
your
plight
what
about
the
fellows
who
have
really
lost
an
arm
well
are
you
settled
thank
goodness
for
that
he
gave
the
porter
a
piece
here
my
man
that
for
you
thank
you
mr
shears
the
englishman
raised
his
eyes
arsène
lupin
you
you
he
blurted
in
his
bewilderment
and
wilson
stammered
waving
his
one
hand
with
the
gestures
of
a
man
proving
a
fact
you
you
but
you
arrested
shears
told
me
so
when
he
left
you
ganimard
and
his
thirty
detectives
had
you
surrounded
lupin
crossed
his
arms
with
an
air
of
indignation
so
you
thought
i
would
let
you
go
without
coming
to
see
you
off
after
the
excellent
friendly
relations
which
we
never
ceased
to
keep
up
why
it
would
have
been
unspeakably
rude
what
do
you
take
me
for
the
engine
whistled
however
i
forgive
you
have
you
all
you
want
tobacco
matches
that
right
and
the
evening
papers
you
will
find
the
details
of
my
arrest
in
them
your
last
exploit
maître

delighted
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
delighted
i
mean
it
and
if
ever
i
can
do
anything
for
you
i
shall
be
only
too
pleased
he
jumped
down
to
the
platform
and
closed
the
door
he
cried
again
waving
his
handkerchief
write
to
you
mind
you
write
too
let
me
know
how
the
broken
arm
is
wilson
i
shall
expect

of
you
just
a
picture
postcard
now
and
again
paris
will
always
find
me
quite
enough
never

about
stamping

second
episode
the

chapter
i
holmlock
shears
and
wilson
were
seated
on
either
side
of
the
fireplace
in
shears
the
great
detective
pipe
had
gone
out
he
knocked
the
ashes
into
the
grate
his
briar
lit
it
gathered
the
skirts
of
his
around
his
knees
puffed
away
and
devoted
all
his
attention
to
sending
rings
of
smoke
curling
gracefully
up
to
the
ceiling
wilson
watched
him
he
watched
him
as
a
dog
rolled
up
on
the
watches
its
master
with
eyes
and
unblinking
lids
eyes
which
have
no
other
hope
than
to
reflect
the
expected
movement
on
the
master
part
would
shears
break
silence
would
he
reveal
the
secret
of
his
present
dreams
and
admit
wilson
to
the
realm
of
meditation
into
which
he
felt
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
enter
uninvited
shears
continued
silent
wilson
ventured
upon
a
remark
things
are
very
quiet
there
not
a
single
case
for
us
to
nibble
at
shears
was
more
and
more
fiercely
silent
but
the
rings
of
became
more
and
more
successful
and
any
one
but
wilson
would
have
observed
that
shears
obtained
from
this
the
profound
content
which
we
derive
from
the
minor
achievements
of
our
vanity
at
times
when
our
brain
is
completely
void
of
thought
disheartened
wilson
rose
and
walked
to
the
window
the
melancholy
street
lay
stretched
between
the
gloomy
fronts
of
the
houses
under
a
dark
sky
whence
fell
an
angry
and
pouring
rain
a
cab
drove
past
another
cab
wilson
jotted
down
their
numbers
in
his
one
can
never
tell
the
postman
came
down
the
street
gave
a
treble
knock
at
the
door
and
presently
the
servant
entered
with
two
registered
letters
you
look
remarkably
pleased
said
wilson
when
shears
had
unsealed
and
glanced
through
the
first
this
letter
contains
a
very
attractive
proposal
you
were
worrying
about
a
case
here
is
one
read
it
wilson
took
the
letter
and
read
paris
sir
i
am
writing
to
ask
for
the
benefit
of
your
assistance
and
experience
i
have
been
the
victim
of
a
serious
theft
and
all
the
investigations
attempted
up
to
the
present
would
seem
to
lead
to
nothing
i
am
sending
you
by
this
post
a
number
of
newspapers
which
will
give
you
all
the
details
of
the
case
and
if
you
are
inclined
to
take
it
up
i
shall
be
pleased
if
you
will
accept
the
hospitality
of
my
house
and
if
you
will
fill
in
the
enclosed
signed
check
for
any
amount
which
you
like
to
name
for
your
expenses
pray
telegraph
to
inform
me
if
i
may
expect
you
and
believe
me
to
be
sir
yours
very
truly
baron
victor
well
said
shears
this
comes
just
at
the
right
time
why
should
i
take
a
little
run
to
paris
i
have
been
there
since
my
famous
duel
with
arsène
lupin
and
i
sha
be
sorry
to
it
under
rather
more
peaceful
conditions
he
tore
the
cheque
into
four
pieces
and
while
wilson
whose
arm
had
not
yet
recovered
from
the
injury
received
in
the
course
of
the
aforesaid
encounter
was
inveighing
bitterly
against
paris
and
all
its
inhabitants
he
opened
the
second
envelope
a
movement
of
irritation
at
once
escaped
him
he
knitted
his
brow
as
he
read
the
letter
and
when
he
had
finished
he
crumpled
it
into
a
ball
and
threw
it
angrily
on
the
floor
what
the
matter
exclaimed
wilson
in
amazement
he
picked
up
the
ball
unfolded
it
and
read
with
stupefaction
my
dear
maître
you
know
my
admiration
for
you
and
the
interest
which
i
take
in
your
reputation
well
accept
my
advice
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
in
which
you
are
asked
to
assist
your
interference
would
do
a
great
deal
of
harm
all
your
efforts
would
only
bring
about
a
pitiable
result
and
you
would
be
obliged
publicly
to
acknowledge
your
defeat
i
am
exceedingly
anxious
to
spare
you
this
humiliation
and
i
beg
you
in
the
name
of
our
mutual
friendship
to
remain
very
quietly
by
your
fireside
give
my
kind
remembrances
to
wilson
and
accept
for
yourself
the
respectful
compliments
of
yours
most
sincerely
arsène
lupin
arsène
lupin
repeated
wilson
in
bewilderment
shears
banged
the
table
with
his
fist
oh
i
getting
sick
of
the
brute
he
laughs
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
schoolboy
i
am
publicly
to
acknowledge
my
defeat
am
i
did
i
compel
him
to
give
up
the
blue
diamond
he
afraid
of
you
suggested
wilson
you
talking
nonsense
arsène
lupin
is
never
afraid
and
the
proof
is
that
he
challenges
me
but
how
does
he
come
to
know
of
baron
letter
how
can
i
tell
you
asking
silly
questions
my
dear
fellow
i
thought
i
imagined
what
that
i
am
a
sorcerer
no
but
i
have
seen
you
perform
such
marvels
no
one
is
able
to
perform
marvels
i
no
more
than
another
i
make
reflections
deductions
conclusions
but
i
do
make
guesses
only
fools
make
guesses
wilson
adopted
the
modest
attitude
of
a
beaten
dog
and
did
his
best
lest
he
should
be
a
fool
not
to
guess
why
shears
was
striding
angrily
up
and
down
the
room
but
when
shears
rang
for
the
servant
and
asked
for
his
wilson
thought
himself
entitled
since
this
was
a
material
fact
to
reflect
deduce
and
conclude
that
his
chief
was
going
on
a
journey
the
same
mental
operation
enabled
him
to
declare
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
has
no
fear
of
the
possibility
of
a
mistake
holmlock
you
are
going
to
paris
possibly
and
you
are
going
to
paris
even
more
in
reply
to
lupin
challenge
than
to
oblige
baron
possibly
holmlock
i
will
go
with
you
aha
old
friend
cried
shears
interrupting
his
walk
are
you
afraid
that
your
left
arm
may
share
the
fate
of
the
right
what
can
happen
to
me
you
will
be
there
well
said
you
a
fine
fellow
and
we
will
show
this
gentleman
that
he
may
have
made
a
mistake
in
defying
us
so
boldly
quick
wilson
and
meet
me
at
the
first
train
wo
you
wait
for
the
newspapers
the
baron
mentions
what
the
good
shall
i
send
a
telegram
no
arsène
lupin
would
know
i
was
coming
and
i
do
wish
him
to
this
time
wilson
we
must
play
a
cautious
game
that
afternoon
the
two
friends
stepped
on
board
the
boat
at
dover
they
had
a
capital
crossing
in
the
express
from
calais
to
paris
shears
indulged
in
three
hours
of
the
soundest
sleep
while
wilson
kept
a
good
watch
at
the
door
of
the
compartment
and
meditated
with
a
wandering
eye
shears
woke
up
feeling
happy
and
well
the
prospect
of
a
new
duel
with
arsène
lupin
delighted
him
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
with
the
contented
air
of
a
man
preparing
to
taste
untold
joys
at
last
exclaimed
wilson
we
shall
feel
that
we
alive
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
with
the
same
contented
air
at
the
station
shears
took
the
rugs
and
followed
by
wilson
carrying
the
bags
each
his
burden
handed
the
tickets
to
the
collector
and
walked
gaily
into
the
street
a
fine
day
wilson
sunshine
paris
is
dressed
in
her
best
to
receive
us
what
a
crowd
so
much
the
better
wilson
we
stand
less
chance
of
being
noticed
no
one
will
recognize
us
in
the
midst
of
such
a
multitude
shears
i
believe
he
stopped
somewhat
taken
aback
who
on
earth
could
be
addressing
him
by
name
a
woman
was
walking
beside
him
or
rather
a
girl
whose
exceedingly
simple
dress
accentuated
her
appearance
her
pretty
face
wore
a
sad
and
anxious
expression
she
repeated
you
must
be
shears
surely
he
was
silent
as
much
from
confusion
as
from
the
habit
of
prudence
and
she
asked
for
the
third
time
surely
i
am
speaking
to
mr
shears
what
do
you
want
with
me
he
asked
crossly
thinking
this
a
questionable
meeting
she
placed
herself
in
front
of
him
listen
to
me
shears
it
is
a
very
serious
matter
i
know
that
you
are
going
to
the
rue
murillo
what
that
i
know
i
know
rue
murillo
no
well
you
must
not
no
you
must
not
go
i
assure
you
you
will
regret
it
because
i
tell
you
this
you
need
not
think
that
i
am
interested
in
any
way
i
have
a
reason
i
know
what
i
am
saying
he
tried
to
push
her
aside
she
insisted
i
entreat
you
do
not
be
obstinate
oh
if
i
only
knew
how
to
convince
you
look
into
me
look
into
the
depths
of
my
eyes
they
are
sincere
they
speak
the
truth
desperately
she
raised
her
eyes
a
pair
of
beautiful
grave
and
limpid
eyes
that
seemed
to
reflect
her
very
soul
wilson
nodded
his
head
the
young
lady
seems
quite
sincere
he
said
indeed
i
am
she
said
beseechingly
and
you
must
trust
me
i
do
trust
you
mademoiselle
replied
wilson
oh
how
happy
you
make
me
and
your
friend
trusts
me
too
does
he
not
i
feel
it
i
am
sure
of
it
how
glad
i
am
all
will
be
well
oh
what
a
good
idea
i
had
listen
shears
there
a
train
for
calais
in
twenty
minutes
now
you
must
take
it
quick
come
with
me
it
this
way
and
you
have
not
much
time
she
tried
to
drag
shears
with
her
he
seized
her
by
the
arm
and
in
a
voice
which
he
strove
to
make
as
gentle
as
possible
said
forgive
me
mademoiselle
if
i
am
not
able
to
accede
to
your
wish
but
i
never
turn
aside
from
a
task
which
i
have
undertaken
i
entreat
you
i
entreat
you
oh
if
you
only
knew
he
passed
on
and
walked
briskly
away
wilson
lingered
behind
and
said
to
the
girl
be
of
good
hope
he
will
see
the
thing
through
to
the
end
he
has
never
yet
been
known
to
fail
and
he
ran
after
shears
to
catch
him
up
versus
arsène
lupin
these
words
standing
out
in
great
black
letters
struck
their
eyes
at
the
first
steps
they
took
they
walked
up
to
them
a
procession
of
was
moving
along
in
single
file
in
their
hands
they
carried
heavy
ferruled
canes
with
which
they
tapped
the
pavement
in
unison
as
they
went
and
their
boards
bore
the
above
legend
in
front
and
a
further
huge
poster
at
the
back
which
read
arrival
of
the
english
champion
the
great
detective
grapples
with
the
rue
murillo
full
details
écho
de
france
wilson
tossed
his
head
i
say
holmlock
i
thought
we
were
travelling
incognito
i
should
be
astonished
to
find
the
republican
guard
waiting
for
us
in
the
rue
murillo
with
an
official
reception
and
champagne
when
you
try
to
be
witty
wilson
snarled
shears
you
witty
enough
for
two
he
strode
up
to
one
of
the
men
with
apparent
intention
of
taking
him
in
his
powerful
hands
and
tearing
him
and
his
advertisement
to
shreds
meanwhile
a
crowd
gathered
round
the
posters
laughing
and
joking
suppressing
a
furious
fit
of
passion
shears
said
to
the
man
when
were
you
hired
this
morning
when
did
you
start
on
your
round
an
hour
ago
but
the
posters
were
ready
lord
yes
they
were
there
when
we
came
to
the
office
this
morning
so
arsène
lupin
had
foreseen
that
shears
would
accept
the
battle
nay
more
the
letter
written
by
lupin
proved
that
he
himself
wished
for
the
battle
and
that
it
formed
part
of
his
intentions
to
measure
swords
once
more
with
his
rival
why
what
possible
motive
could
urge
him
to
the
contest
holmlock
shears
showed
a
momentary
hesitation
lupin
must
really
feel
very
sure
of
victory
to
display
such
insolence
and
was
it
not
falling
into
a
trap
to
hasten
like
that
in
answer
to
the
first
call
then
summoning
up
all
his
energy
come
along
wilson
driver
rue
murillo
he
shouted
and
with
swollen
veins
and
fists
clenched
as
though
for
a
he
leapt
into
a
cab
the
rue
murillo
is
lined
with
luxurious
private
residences
the
backs
of
which
look
out
upon
the
parc
monceau
no
is
one
of
the
handsomest
of
these
houses
and
baron
who
occupies
it
with
his
wife
and
children
has
furnished
it
in
the
most
sumptuous
style
as
befits
an
artist
and
millionaire
there
is
a
courtyard
in
front
of
the
house
skirted
on
either
side
by
the
servants
offices
at
the
back
a
garden
mingles
the
branches
of
its
trees
with
the
trees
of
the
park
the
two
englishmen
rang
the
bell
crossed
the
courtyard
and
were
admitted
by
a
footman
who
showed
them
into
a
small
at
the
other
side
of
the
house
they
sat
down
and
took
a
rapid
survey
of
the
many
valuable
objects
with
which
the
room
was
filled
very
pretty
things
whispered
wilson
taste
and
fancy
one
can
safely
draw
the
deduction
that
people
who
have
had
the
leisure
to
hunt
out
these
articles
are
persons
of
a
certain
age
fifty
perhaps
he
did
not
have
time
to
finish
the
door
opened
and
entered
followed
by
his
wife
contrary
to
wilson
deductions
they
were
both
young
fashionably
dressed
and
very
lively
in
speech
and
manner
both
were
profuse
in
thanks
it
is
really
too
good
of
you
to
put
yourself
out
like
this
we
are
almost
glad
of
this
trouble
since
it
procures
us
the
pleasure
how
charming
those
french
people
are
thought
wilson
who
never
shirked
the
opportunity
of
making
an
original
observation
but
time
is
money
cried
the
baron
and
yours
especially
shears
let
us
come
to
the
point
what
do
you
think
of
the
case
do
you
hope
to
bring
it
to
a
satisfactory
result
to
bring
the
case
to
a
satisfactory
result
i
must
first
know
what
the
case
is
do
you
know
no
and
i
will
ask
you
to
explain
the
matter
fully
omitting
nothing
what
is
it
a
case
of
it
is
a
case
of
theft
on
what
day
did
it
take
place
on
saturday
replied
the
baron
on
saturday
night
or
sunday
morning
six
days
ago
therefore
now
pray
go
on
i
must
first
tell
you
that
my
wife
and
i
though
we
lead
the
life
expected
of
people
in
our
position
go
out
very
little
the
education
of
our
children
a
few
receptions
the
beautifying
of
our
home
these
make
up
our
existence
and
all
or
nearly
all
our
evenings
are
spent
here
in
this
room
which
is
my
wife
boudoir
and
in
which
we
have
collected
a
few
pretty
things
well
on
saturday
last
at
about
eleven
i
switched
off
the
electric
light
and
my
wife
and
i
retired
as
usual
to
our
bedroom
where
is
that
the
next
room
that
door
over
there
on
the
following
morning
that
is
to
say
sunday
i
rose
early
as
suzanne
my
wife
was
still
asleep
i
came
into
this
room
as
gently
as
possible
so
as
not
to
awake
her
imagine
my
surprise
at
finding
the
window
open
after
we
had
left
it
closed
the
evening
before
a
servant
nobody
enters
this
room
in
the
morning
before
we
ring
besides
i
always
take
the
precaution
of
bolting
that
other
door
which
leads
to
the
hall
therefore
the
window
must
have
been
opened
from
the
outside
i
had
a
proof
of
it
besides
the
second
pane
of
the
casement
the
one
next
to
the
latch
had
been
cut
out
and
the
window
the
window
as
you
perceive
opens
on
a
little
balcony
surrounded
by
a
stone
balustrade
we
are
on
the
first
floor
here
and
you
can
see
the
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
the
railings
that
separate
it
from
the
parc
monceau
it
is
certain
therefore
that
the
man
came
from
the
parc
monceau
climbed
the
railings
by
means
of
a
ladder
and
got
up
to
the
balcony
it
is
certain
you
say
on
either
side
of
the
railings
in
the
soft
earth
of
the
borders
we
found
holes
left
by
the
two
uprights
of
the
ladder
and
there
were
two
similar
holes
below
the
balcony
lastly
the
balustrade
shows
two
slight
scratches
evidently
caused
by
the
contact
of
the
ladder
is
the
parc
monceau
closed
at
night
closed
no
but
in
any
case
there
is
a
house
building
at
no
it
would
have
been
easy
to
effect
an
entrance
that
way
holmlock
shears
reflected
for
a
few
moments
and
resumed
let
us
come
to
the
theft
you
say
it
was
committed
in
the
room
where
we
now
are
yes
just
here
between
this
virgin
and
that
tabernacle
there
was
a
little
jewish
lamp
it
has
disappeared
and
is
that
all
that
is
all
oh
and
what
do
you
call
a
jewish
lamp
it
is
one
of
those
lamps
which
they
used
to
employ
in
the
old
days
consisting
of
a
stem
and
of
a
receiver
to
contain
the
oil
this
receiver
had
two
or
more
burners
which
held
the
wicks
when
all
is
said
objects
of
no
great
value
just
so
but
the
one
in
question
formed
a
in
which
we
had
made
it
a
practice
to
keep
a
magnificent
antique
jewel
a
chimera
in
gold
set
with
rubies
and
emeralds
and
worth
a
great
deal
of
money
what
was
your
reason
for
this
practice
upon
my
word
shears
i
should
find
it
difficult
to
tell
you
perhaps
we
just
thought
it
amusing
to
have
a
of
this
kind
did
nobody
know
of
it
nobody
except
of
course
the
thief
objected
shears
but
for
that
he
would
not
have
taken
the
trouble
to
steal
the
jewish
lamp
obviously
but
how
could
he
know
of
it
seeing
that
it
was
by
an
accident
that
we
discovered
the
secret
mechanism
of
the
lamp
the
same
accident
may
have
revealed
it
to
somebody
else
a
servant
a
visitor
to
the
house
but
let
us
continue
have
you
informed
the
police
certainly
the
has
made
his
inquiry
the
journalistic
detectives
attached
to
all
the
big
newspapers
have
made
theirs
but
as
i
wrote
to
you
it
does
not
seem
as
though
the
problem
had
the
least
chance
of
ever
being
solved
shears
rose
went
to
the
window
inspected
the
casement
the
balcony
the
balustrade
employed
his
lens
to
study
the
two
scratches
on
the
stone
and
asked
to
take
him
down
to
the
garden
when
they
were
outside
shears
simply
sat
down
in
a
wicker
chair
and
contemplated
the
roof
of
the
house
with
a
dreamy
eye
then
he
suddenly
walked
toward
two
little
wooden
cases
with
which
in
order
to
preserve
the
exact
marks
they
had
covered
the
holes
which
the
uprights
of
the
ladder
had
left
in
the
ground
below
the
balcony
he
removed
the
cases
went
down
on
his
knees
and
with
rounded
back
and
his
nose
six
inches
from
the
ground
searched
and
took
his
measurements
he
went
through
the
same
performance
along
the
railing
but
more
quickly
that
was
all
they
both
returned
to
the
boudoir
where
madame
was
waiting
for
them
shears
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
longer
and
then
spoke
these
words
ever
since
you
began
your
story
monsieur
le
baron
i
was
struck
by
the
really
too
simple
side
of
the
offence
to
apply
a
ladder
remove
a
pane
of
glass
pick
out
an
object
and
go
away
no
things
do
happen
so
easily
as
that
it
is
all
too
clear
too
plain
you
mean
to
say
i
mean
to
say
that
the
theft
of
the
jewish
lamp
was
committed
under
the
direction
of
arsène
lupin
arsène
lupin
exclaimed
the
baron
but
it
was
committed
without
arsène
lupin
presence
and
without
anybody
entering
the
house
perhaps
a
servant
slipped
down
to
the
balcony
from
his
garret
along
a
which
i
saw
from
the
garden
but
what
evidence
have
you
arsène
lupin
would
not
have
left
the
boudoir
and
what
about
the
lamp
taking
the
lamp
would
not
have
prevented
him
from
taking
this
which
i
see
is
studded
with
diamonds
or
this
necklace
of
old
opals
it
would
require
but
two
movements
more
his
only
reason
for
not
making
those
movements
was
that
he
was
not
here
to
make
them
still
the
marks
of
the
ladder
a
farce
mere
to
divert
suspicions
the
scratches
on
the
balustrade
a
sham
they
were
made
with
sandpaper
look
here
are
a
few
bits
of
paper
which
i
picked
up
the
marks
left
by
the
uprights
of
the
ladder
humbug
examine
the
two
rectangular
holes
below
the
balcony
and
the
two
holes
near
the
railings
the
shape
is
similar
but
whereas
they
are
parallel
here
they
are
not
so
over
there
measure
the
space
that
separates
each
hole
from
its
neighbour
it
differs
in
the
two
cases
below
the
balcony
the
distance
is
nine
inches
beside
the
railings
it
is
eleven
inches
what
do
you
conclude
from
that
i
conclude
since
their
outline
is
identical
that
the
four
holes
were
made
with
one
stump
of
wood
cut
to
the
right
shape
the
best
argument
would
be
the
stump
of
wood
itself
here
it
is
said
shears
i
picked
it
up
in
the
garden
behind
a
the
baron
gave
in
it
was
only
forty
minutes
since
the
englishman
had
entered
by
that
door
and
not
a
vestige
remained
of
all
that
had
been
believed
so
far
on
the
evidence
of
the
apparent
facts
themselves
the
reality
a
different
reality
came
to
light
founded
upon
something
much
more
solid
the
reasoning
faculties
of
a
holmlock
shears
it
is
a
very
serious
accusation
to
bring
against
our
people
shears
said
the
baroness
they
are
old
family
servants
and
not
one
of
them
is
capable
of
deceiving
us
if
one
of
them
did
not
deceive
you
how
do
you
explain
that
this
letter
was
able
to
reach
me
on
the
same
day
and
by
the
same
post
as
the
one
you
sent
me
and
he
handed
her
the
letter
which
arsène
lupin
had
written
to
him
madame
was
dumbfounded
arsène
lupin
how
did
he
know
did
you
tell
no
one
of
your
letter
no
one
said
the
baron
the
idea
occurred
to
us
the
other
evening
at
dinner
before
the
servants
there
were
only
our
two
children
and
even
then
no
sophie
and
henrietta
were
not
at
table
were
they
suzanne
madame
reflected
and
declared
no
they
had
gone
up
to
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
asked
shears
the
governess
alice
demun
does
she
have
her
meals
with
you
no
she
has
them
by
herself
in
her
room
wilson
had
an
idea
the
letter
written
to
my
friend
holmlock
shears
was
posted
naturally
who
posted
it
dominique
who
has
been
with
me
as
my
own
man
for
twenty
years
replied
the
baron
any
search
in
that
direction
would
be
waste
of
time
time
employed
in
searching
is
never
wasted
stated
wilson
sententiously
this
closed
the
first
inquiries
and
shears
asked
leave
to
withdraw
an
hour
later
at
dinner
he
saw
sophie
and
henrietta
the
children
two
pretty
little
girls
of
eight
and
six
respectively
the
conversation
languished
shears
replied
to
the
pleasant
remarks
of
the
baron
and
his
wife
in
so
surly
a
tone
that
they
thought
it
better
to
keep
silence
coffee
was
served
shears
swallowed
the
contents
of
his
cup
and
rose
from
his
chair
at
that
moment
a
servant
entered
with
a
telephone
message
for
him
shears
opened
it
and
read
accept
my
enthusiastic
admiration
results
obtained
by
you
in
so
short
a
time
make
my
head
reel
i
feel
quite
giddy
arsène
lupin
he
could
not
suppress
a
gesture
of
annoyance
and
showing
the
telegram
to
the
baron
do
you
begin
to
believe
he
said
that
your
walls
have
eyes
and
ears
i
ca
understand
it
murmured
astounded
nor
i
but
what
i
do
understand
is
that
not
a
movement
takes
place
here
unperceived
by
him
not
a
word
is
spoken
but
he
hears
it
that
evening
wilson
went
to
bed
with
the
easy
conscience
of
a
man
who
has
done
his
duty
and
who
has
no
other
business
before
him
than
to
go
to
sleep
so
he
went
to
sleep
very
quickly
and
was
visited
by
beautiful
dreams
in
which
he
was
hunting
down
lupin
all
by
himself
and
just
on
the
point
of
arresting
him
with
his
own
hand
and
the
feeling
of
the
pursuit
was
so
lifelike
that
he
woke
up
some
one
was
touching
his
bed
he
seized
his
revolver
another
movement
lupin
and
i
shoot
steady
old
chap
steady
on
hullo
is
that
you
shears
do
you
want
me
i
want
your
eyes
get
up
he
led
him
to
the
window
look
over
there
beyond
the
railings
in
the
park
yes
do
you
see
anything
no
nothing
try
again
i
am
sure
you
see
something
oh
so
i
do
a
shadow
no
two
i
thought
so
against
the
railings
see
they
moving
lose
no
time
groping
and
holding
on
to
the
banister
they
made
their
way
down
the
stairs
and
came
to
a
room
that
opened
on
to
the
garden
steps
through
the
glass
doors
they
could
see
the
two
figures
still
in
the
same
place
it
curious
said
shears
i
seem
to
hear
noises
in
the
house
in
the
house
impossible
everbody
asleep
listen
though
at
that
moment
a
faint
whistle
sounded
from
the
railings
and
they
perceived
an
undecided
light
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
house
the
must
have
switched
on
their
light
muttered
shears
it
their
room
above
us
then
it
they
we
heard
no
doubt
said
wilson
perhaps
they
are
watching
the
railings
a
second
whistle
still
fainter
than
the
first
i
ca
understand
i
ca
understand
said
shears
in
a
tone
of
vexation
no
more
can
i
confessed
wilson
shears
turned
the
key
of
the
door
unbolted
it
and
softly
pushed
it
open
a
third
whistle
this
time
a
little
deeper
and
in
a
different
note
and
above
their
heads
the
noise
grew
louder
more
hurried
it
sounds
rather
as
if
it
were
on
the
balcony
of
the
boudoir
whispered
shears
he
put
his
head
between
the
glass
doors
but
at
once
drew
back
with
a
stifled
oath
wilson
looked
out
in
his
turn
close
to
them
a
ladder
rose
against
the
wall
leaning
against
the
balustrade
of
the
balcony
by
jove
said
shears
there
some
one
in
the
boudoir
that
what
we
heard
quick
let
take
away
the
ladder
but
at
that
moment
a
form
slid
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
the
ladder
was
removed
and
the
man
who
carried
it
ran
swiftly
toward
the
railings
to
the
place
where
his
accomplices
were
waiting
shears
and
wilson
had
darted
out
they
came
up
with
the
man
as
he
was
placing
the
ladder
against
the
railings
two
shots
rang
out
from
the
other
side
wounded
cried
shears
no
replied
wilson
he
caught
the
man
around
the
body
and
tried
to
throw
him
but
the
man
turned
seized
him
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
plunged
a
knife
full
into
his
chest
wilson
gave
a
sigh
staggered
and
fell
damnation
roared
shears
if
they
done
for
him
i
do
for
them
he
laid
wilson
on
the
lawn
and
rushed
at
the
ladder
too
late
the
man
had
run
up
it
and
in
company
with
his
accomplices
was
fleeing
through
the
shrubs
wilson
wilson
it
not
serious
is
it
say
it
only
a
scratch
the
doors
of
the
house
opened
suddenly
was
the
first
to
appear
followed
by
the
carrying
candles
what
is
it
cried
the
baron
is
wilson
hurt
nothing
only
a
scratch
repeated
shears
endeavouring
to
delude
himself
into
the
belief
wilson
was
bleeding
copiously
and
his
face
was
deathly
pale
twenty
minutes
later
the
doctor
declared
that
the
point
of
the
knife
had
penetrated
to
within
a
quarter
of
an
inch
of
the
heart
a
quarter
of
an
inch
that
wilson
was
always
a
lucky
dog
said
shears
summing
up
the
situation
in
an
envious
tone
lucky
lucky
grunted
the
doctor
why
with
his
strong
constitution
he
be
all
right
after
six
weeks
in
bed
and
two
months
convalescence
no
longer
no
unless
complications
ensue
why
on
earth
should
there
be
any
complications
fully
reassured
shears
returned
to
in
the
boudoir
this
time
the
mysterious
visitor
had
not
shown
the
same
discretion
he
had
laid
hands
without
shame
on
the
on
the
opal
necklace
and
generally
on
anything
that
could
find
room
in
the
pockets
of
a
burglar
the
window
was
still
open
one
of
the
panes
had
been
neatly
cut
out
and
a
summary
inquiry
held
at
daybreak
showed
that
the
ladder
came
from
the
unfinished
house
and
that
the
burglars
must
have
come
that
way
in
short
said
with
a
touch
of
irony
in
his
voice
it
is
an
exact
repetition
of
the
theft
of
the
jewish
lamp
yes
if
we
accept
the
first
version
favoured
by
the
police
do
you
still
refuse
to
adopt
it
does
this
second
theft
shake
your
opinion
as
regards
the
first
on
the
contrary
it
confirms
it
it
seems
incredible
you
have
the
undoubted
proof
that
last
burglary
was
committed
by
somebody
from
the
outside
and
you
still
maintain
that
the
jewish
lamp
was
stolen
by
one
of
our
people
by
some
one
living
in
the
house
then
how
do
you
explain
i
explain
nothing
monsieur
i
establish
two
facts
which
resemble
each
other
only
in
appearance
i
weigh
them
separately
and
i
am
trying
to
find
the
link
that
connects
them
his
conviction
seemed
so
profound
his
actions
based
upon
such
powerful
motives
that
the
baron
gave
way
very
well
let
us
go
and
inform
the
commissary
of
the
police
on
no
account
exclaimed
the
englishman
eagerly
on
no
account
whatever
the
police
are
people
whom
i
apply
to
only
when
i
want
them
still
the
shots
never
mind
the
shots
your
friend
my
friend
is
only
wounded
make
the
doctor
hold
his
tongue
i
will
take
all
the
responsibility
as
regards
the
police
two
days
elapsed
devoid
of
all
incident
during
which
shears
pursued
his
task
with
a
minute
care
and
a
conscientiousness
that
was
exasperated
by
the
memory
of
that
daring
onslaught
perpetrated
under
his
eyes
despite
his
presence
and
without
his
being
able
to
prevent
its
success
he
searched
the
house
and
garden
indefatigably
talked
to
the
servants
and
paid
long
visits
to
the
kitchen
and
stables
and
though
he
gathered
no
clue
that
threw
any
light
upon
the
subject
he
did
not
lose
courage
i
shall
find
what
i
am
looking
for
he
thought
and
i
shall
find
it
here
it
is
not
a
question
now
as
in
the
case
of
the
blonde
lady
of
walking
at
and
of
reaching
by
roads
unknown
to
me
an
equally
unknown
goal
this
time
i
am
on
the
battlefield
itself
the
enemy
is
no
longer
the
invisible
elusive
lupin
but
the
accomplice
who
moves
within
the
four
walls
of
this
house
give
me
the
least
little
particular
and
i
know
where
i
stand
this
little
particular
from
which
he
was
to
derive
such
remarkable
consequences
with
a
skill
so
prodigious
that
the
case
of
the
jewish
lamp
may
be
looked
upon
as
one
in
which
his
detective
genius
bursts
forth
most
triumphantly
this
little
particular
he
was
to
obtain
by
accident
on
the
third
day
entering
the
room
above
the
boudoir
which
was
used
as
a
schoolroom
for
the
children
he
came
upon
henriette
the
smaller
of
the
two
she
was
looking
for
her
scissors
you
know
she
said
to
shears
i
make
papers
too
like
the
one
you
got
the
other
evening
the
other
evening
yes
after
dinner
you
got
a
paper
with
strips
on
it
you
know
a
telegram
well
i
make
them
too
she
went
out
to
any
one
else
these
words
would
have
represented
only
the
insignificant
observation
of
a
child
and
shears
himself
listened
without
paying
much
attention
and
continued
his
inspection
but
suddenly
he
started
running
after
the
child
whose
last
phrase
had
all
at
once
impressed
him
he
caught
her
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
and
said
so
you
stick
strips
on
to
paper
also
do
you
henriette
very
proudly
declared
yes
i
cut
out
the
words
and
stick
them
on
and
who
taught
you
that
pretty
game
mademoiselle
my
governess
i
saw
her
do
it
she
takes
words
out
of
newspapers
and
sticks
them
on
and
what
does
she
do
with
them
makes
telegrams
and
letters
which
she
sends
off
holmlock
shears
returned
to
the
schoolroom
singularly
puzzled
by
this
confidence
and
doing
his
utmost
to
extract
from
it
the
inferences
of
which
it
allowed
there
was
a
bundle
of
newspapers
on
the
he
opened
them
and
saw
in
fact
that
there
were
groups
of
words
or
lines
missing
regularly
and
neatly
cut
out
but
he
had
only
to
read
the
words
that
came
before
or
after
to
ascertain
that
the
missing
words
had
been
removed
with
the
scissors
at
random
evidently
by
henriette
it
was
possible
that
in
the
pile
of
papers
there
was
one
which
mademoiselle
had
cut
herself
but
how
was
he
to
make
sure
mechanically
shears
turned
the
pages
of
the
heaped
up
on
the
table
and
of
some
others
lying
on
the
shelves
of
a
cupboard
and
suddenly
a
cry
of
joy
escaped
him
in
a
corner
of
the
cupboard
under
a
pile
of
old
he
had
found
a
children
album
a
sort
of
picture
alphabet
and
in
one
of
the
pages
of
this
album
he
had
seen
a
gap
he
examined
the
page
it
gave
the
names
of
the
days
of
the
week
sunday
monday
tuesday
and
so
on
the
word
saturday
was
missing
now
the
jewish
lamp
was
stolen
on
a
saturday
night
shears
felt
that
little
clutch
at
his
heart
which
always
told
him
in
the
plainest
manner
possible
when
he
had
hit
upon
the
knotty
point
of
a
mystery
that
grip
of
truth
that
feeling
of
certainty
never
deceived
him
he
hastened
to
turn
over
the
pages
of
the
album
feverishly
and
confidently
a
little
further
on
came
another
surprise
it
was
a
page
consisting
of
capital
letters
followed
by
a
row
of
figures
nine
of
the
letters
and
three
of
the
figures
had
been
carefully
removed
shears
wrote
them
down
in
his
in
the
order
which
they
would
have
occupied
and
obtained
the
following
result
c
d
e
h
n
o
p
r
z
by
jove
he
muttered
there
not
much
to
be
made
out
of
that
at
first
sight
was
it
possible
to
rearrange
these
letters
and
employing
them
all
to
form
one
two
or
three
complete
words
shears
attempted
to
do
so
in
vain
one
solution
alone
suggested
itself
returned
continually
to
the
point
of
his
pencil
and
in
the
end
appeared
to
him
the
right
one
because
it
agreed
with
the
logic
of
the
facts
and
also
corresponded
with
the
general
circumstances
admitting
that
the
page
in
the
album
contained
each
of
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
once
and
once
only
it
was
probable
it
was
certain
that
he
had
to
do
with
incomplete
words
and
that
these
words
had
been
completed
with
letters
taken
from
other
pages
given
these
conditions
and
allowing
for
the
possibility
of
a
mistake
the
puzzle
stood
thus
r
e
p
o
n
d
z
c
h
the
first
word
was
clear
reply
an
e
was
missing
because
the
letter
e
having
been
once
used
was
no
longer
available
as
for
the
last
unfinished
word
it
undoubtedly
formed
with
the
number
the
address
which
the
sender
gave
to
the
receiver
of
the
letter
he
was
advised
to
fix
the
day
for
saturday
and
asked
to
send
a
reply
to
c
h
either
c
h
was
the
official
number
of
a
or
else
the
two
letters
c
h
formed
part
of
an
incomplete
word
shears
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
album
nothing
had
been
cut
from
any
of
the
following
pages
he
must
therefore
until
further
orders
be
content
with
the
explanation
hit
upon
is
it
fun
henriette
had
returned
he
replied
yes
great
fun
only
have
you
any
other
papers
or
else
some
words
ready
cut
out
for
me
to
stick
on
papers
no
and
then
mademoiselle
would
like
it
mademoiselle
yes
mademoiselle
has
scolded
me
already
why
because
i
told
you
things
and
she
says
you
must
never
tell
things
about
people
you
are
fond
of
you
were
quite
right
to
tell
me
henriette
seemed
delighted
with
his
approval
so
much
so
that
from
a
tiny
canvas
bag
pinned
on
to
her
frock
she
took
a
few
strips
of
stuff
three
buttons
two
lumps
of
sugar
and
lastly
a
square
piece
of
paper
which
she
held
out
to
shears
there
i
give
it
you
all
the
same
it
was
the
number
of
a
cab
no
where
did
you
get
this
from
it
fell
out
of
her
purse
when
on
sunday
at
mass
when
she
was
taking
out
some
coppers
for
the
collection
capital
and
now
i
will
tell
you
how
not
to
get
scolded
do
tell
mademoiselle
that
you
have
seen
me
shears
went
off
in
search
of
and
asked
him
straight
out
about
mademoiselle
the
baron
gave
a
start
alice
demun
would
you
think
oh
impossible
how
long
has
she
been
in
your
service
only
twelve
months
but
i
know
no
quieter
person
nor
any
in
whom
i
place
more
confidence
how
is
it
that
i
have
not
yet
seen
her
she
was
away
for
two
days
and
at
present
immediately
on
her
return
she
took
up
her
position
by
your
bedside
she
is
a
nurse
gentle
attentive
wilson
seems
delighted
with
her
oh
said
shears
who
had
quite
omitted
to
inquire
after
old
progress
he
thought
for
a
moment
and
asked
and
did
she
go
out
on
sunday
morning
the
day
after
the
robbery
yes
the
baron
called
his
wife
and
put
the
question
to
her
she
replied
mademoiselle
took
the
children
to
the
eleven
mass
as
usual
but
before
that
before
no
or
rather
but
i
was
so
upset
by
the
theft
still
i
remember
that
on
the
evening
before
she
asked
leave
to
go
out
on
sunday
morning
to
see
a
cousin
who
was
passing
through
paris
i
think
but
surely
you
do
suspect
her
certainly
not
but
i
should
like
to
see
her
he
went
up
to
wilson
room
a
woman
dressed
like
a
hospital
nurse
in
a
long
gray
linen
gown
was
stooping
over
the
sick
man
and
giving
him
a
draught
when
she
turned
round
shears
recognized
the
girl
who
had
spoken
to
him
outside
the
gare
du
nord
not
the
slightest
explanation
passed
between
them
alice
demun
smiled
gently
with
her
grave
and
charming
eyes
without
a
trace
of
embarrassment
the
englishman
wanted
to
speak
tried
to
utter
a
syllable
or
two
and
was
silent
then
she
resumed
her
task
moved
about
peacefully
before
shears
astonished
eyes
shifted
bottles
rolled
and
unrolled
linen
bandages
and
again
gave
him
her
bright
smile
shears
turned
on
his
heels
went
downstairs
saw
motor
in
the
courtyard
got
into
it
and
told
the
chauffeur
to
drive
him
to
the
yard
at
levallois
of
which
the
address
was
marked
on
the
given
him
by
the
child
duprêt
the
driver
who
had
taken
out
no
on
sunday
morning
was
not
there
and
shears
sent
back
the
and
waited
until
he
came
to
change
horses
duprêt
the
driver
said
yes
he
had
taken
up
a
lady
near
the
parc
monceau
a
young
lady
in
black
with
a
big
veil
on
her
she
seemed
very
excited
was
she
carrying
a
parcel
yes
a
longish
parcel
and
where
did
you
drive
her
to
avenue
des
ternes
at
the
corner
of
the
place
she
stayed
for
ten
minutes
or
so
and
then
we
went
back
to
the
parc
monceau
would
you
know
the
house
again
in
the
avenue
des
ternes
rather
shall
i
take
you
there
presently

first
to
quai
des
orfèvres
at
the
police
headquarters

had
the
good
fortune
to
come
upon
ganimard
are
you
disengaged
m
ganimard
if

about
lupin
then
i
sha
stir
what

give
up
the
impossible

am
tired
of
this
unequal
contest
of
which

certain
to
have
the
worst
it
cowardly
it
ridiculous
anything

please
i
do

sight

enough
said
ganimard
innocently
and
as
you
seem
to
want
another
beating
come
along
ganimard
and
shears
stepped
into
the
cab
they
told
the
driver
to
stop
a
little
way
before
he
came
to
the
house
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
avenue
in
front
of
a
small
café
they
sat
down
outside
it
among
tubs
of
laurels
and
the
light
was
beginning
to
wane
waiter
said
shears
pen
and
ink
he
wrote
a
note
and
calling
the
waiter
again
said
take
this
to
the
concierge
of
the
house
opposite
it
the
man
in
the
cap
smoking
his
pipe
in
the
gateway
the
concierge
hurried
across
and
after
ganimard
had
announced
himself
as
a
shears
asked
if
a
young
lady
in
black
had
called
at
the
house
on
sunday
morning
in
black
yes
about
nine
it
the
one
who
goes
up
to
the
second
floor
do
you
see
much
of
her
no
but
she
been
oftener
lately
almost
every
day
during
the
past
fortnight
and
since
sunday
only
once
without
counting
what
has
she
been
she
there
now
she
there
now
yes
she
came
about
ten
minutes
ago
her
cab
is
waiting
on
the
place
as
usual
i
passed
her
in
the
gateway
and
who
is
the
tenant
of
the
second
floor
there
are
two
a
dressmaker
mademoiselle
langeais
and
a
gentleman
who
hired
a
couple
of
furnished
rooms
a
month
ago
under
the
name
of
bresson
what
makes
you
say
the
name
i
have
an
idea
that
it
an
assumed
name
my
wife
does
his
rooms
well
he
has
two
articles
of
clothing
marked
with
the
same
initials
how
does
he
live
oh
he
almost
always
out
sometimes
he
does
not
come
home
for
three
days
together
did
he
come
in
on
saturday
night
on
saturday
night
wait
while
i
think
yes
he
came
in
on
saturday
night
and
has
stirred
out
since
and
what
sort
of
a
man
is
he
faith
i
could
say
he
changes
so
he
tall
he
short
he
fat
he
thin
dark
and
fair
i
do
always
recognize
him
ganimard
and
shears
exchanged
glances
it
he
muttered
ganimard
it
must
be
he
for
a
moment
the
old
detective
experienced
a
real
agitation
which
betrayed
itself
by
a
deep
breath
and
a
clenching
of
the
fists
shears
too
although
more
master
of
himself
felt
something
clutching
at
his
heart
look
out
said
the
concierge
here
comes
the
young
lady
as
he
spoke
mademoiselle
appeared
in
the
gateway
and
crossed
the
square
and
here
is
m
bresson
bresson
which
is
he
the
gentleman
with
a
parcel
under
his
arm
but
he
taking
no
notice
of
the
girl
she
is
going
to
her
cab
alone
oh
well
i
never
seen
them
together
the
two
detectives
rose
hurriedly
by
the
light
of
the
they
recognized
lupin
figure
as
he
walked
away
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
square
which
will
you
follow
asked
ganimard
of
course
he
big
game
then
i
shadow
the
young
lady
suggested
ganimard
no
no
said
the
englishman
quickly
not
wishing
to
reveal
any
part
of
the
case
to
ganimard
i
know
where
to
find
the
young
lady
when
i
want
her
do
leave
me
at
a
distance
and
availing
themselves
of
the
occasional
shelter
of
the
and
the
kiosks
ganimard
and
shears
set
off
in
pursuit
of
lupin
it
was
an
easy
enough
pursuit
for
he
did
not
turn
round
and
walked
quickly
with
a
slight
lameness
in
the
right
leg
so
slight
that
it
needed
the
eye
of
a
trained
observer
to
perceive
it
he
pretending
to
limp
said
ganimard
and
he
continued
ah
if
we
could
only
pick
up
two
or
three
policemen
and
pounce
upon
the
fellow
as
it
is
here
a
chance
of
our
losing
him
but
no
policeman
appeared
in
sight
before
the
porte
des
ternes
and
once
the
fortifications
were
passed
they
could
not
reckon
on
the
least
assistance
let
us
separate
said
shears
the
place
is
deserted
they
were
on
the
boulevard
they
each
took
a
different
pavement
and
followed
the
line
of
the
trees
they
walked
like
this
for
twenty
minutes
until
the
moment
when
lupin
turned
to
the
left
and
along
the
seine
here
they
saw
him
go
down
to
the
edge
of
the
river
he
remained
there
for
a
few
seconds
during
which
they
were
unable
to
distinguish
his
movements
then
he
climbed
up
the
bank
again
and
returned
by
the
way
he
had
come
they
pressed
back
against
the
pillars
of
a
gate
lupin
passed
in
front
of
them
he
no
longer
carried
a
parcel
and
as
he
moved
away
another
figure
appeared
from
behind
the
corner
of
a
house
and
slipped
in
between
the
trees
shears
said
in
a
low
voice
that
one
seems
to
be
following
him
too
yes
i
believe
i
saw
him
before
as
we
came
the
pursuit
was
resumed
but
was
now
complicated
by
the
presence
of
this
figure
lupin
followed
the
same
road
passed
through
the
porte
des
ternes
again
and
entered
the
house
on
the
place
the
concierge
was
closing
the
door
for
the
night
when
ganimard
came
up
you
saw
him
i
suppose
yes
i
was
turning
off
the
gas
on
the
stairs
he
has
bolted
his
door
is
there
no
one
with
him
no
one
he
does
keep
a
servant
he
never
has
his
meals
here
is
there
no
back
staircase
no
ganimard
said
to
shears
the
best
thing
will
be
for
me
to
place
myself
outside
lupin
door
while
you
go
to
the
rue
demours
and
fetch
the
commissary
of
police
give
you
a
line
for
him
shears
objected
suppose
he
escapes
meanwhile
but
i
shall
be
here
it
would
be
an
unequal
contest
between
you
and
him
still
i
ca
break
into
his
rooms
i
not
entitled
to
especially
at
night
shears
shrugged
his
shoulders
once
you
arrested
lupin
no
one
will
haul
you
over
the
coals
for
the
particular
manner
in
which
you
effected
the
arrest
besides
we
may
as
well
ring
the
bell
what
then
we
see
what
happens
they
went
up
the
stairs
there
was
a
double
door
on
the
left
of
the
landing
ganimard
rang
the
bell
not
a
sound
he
rang
again
no
one
stirred
let
go
in
muttered
shears
yes
come
along
nevertheless
they
remained
motionless
irresolute
like
people
who
hesitate
before
taking
a
decisive
step
they
were
afraid
to
act
and
it
suddenly
seemed
to
them
impossible
that
arsène
lupin
should
be
there
so
near
to
them
behind
that
frail
partition
which
they
could
smash
with
a
blow
of
their
fists
they
both
of
them
knew
him
too
well
demon
that
he
was
to
admit
that
he
would
allow
himself
to
be
nabbed
so
stupidly
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
he
was
not
there
he
must
have
escaped
by
the
adjoining
houses
by
the
roofs
by
some
suitably
prepared
outlet
and
once
again
the
shadow
of
arsène
lupin
was
all
that
they
could
hope
to
lay
hands
upon
they
shuddered
an
imperceptible
sound
coming
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
had
as
it
were
grazed
the
silence
and
they
received
the
impression
the
certainty
that
he
was
there
after
all
separated
from
them
by
that
thin
wooden
partition
and
that
he
was
listening
to
them
that
he
heard
them
what
were
they
to
do
it
was
a
tragic
situation
for
all
their
coolness
as
old
stagers
of
the
police
they
were
overcome
by
so
great
an
excitement
that
they
imagined
they
could
hear
the
beating
of
their
own
hearts
ganimard
consulted
shears
with
a
silent
glance
and
then
struck
the
door
violently
with
his
fist
a
sound
of
footsteps
was
now
heard
a
sound
which
there
was
no
longer
any
attempt
to
conceal
ganimard
shook
the
door
shears
gave
an
irresistible
thrust
with
his
shoulder
and
burst
it
open
and
they
both
rushed
in
then
they
stopped
short
a
shot
resounded
in
the
next
room
and
another
followed
by
the
thud
of
a
falling
body
when
they
entered
they
saw
the
man
lying
with
his
face
against
the
marble
of
the
he
gave
a
convulsive
movement
his
revolver
slipped
from
his
hand
ganimard
stooped
and
turned
the
dead
man
head
it
was
covered
with
blood
which
trickled
from
two
large
wounds
in
the
cheek
and
temple
there
no
recognizing
him
he
whispered
one
thing
is
certain
said
shears
it
not
how
do
you
know
you
have
even
examined
him
the
englishman
sneered
do
you
think
arsène
lupin
is
the
man
to
kill
himself
still
we
believed
we
knew
him
outside
we
believed
because
we
to
believe
the
fellow
besets
our
minds
then
it
one
of
his
accomplices
arsène
lupin
accomplices
do
not
kill
themselves
then
who
is
it
they
searched
the
body
in
one
pocket
holmlock
shears
found
an
empty
in
another
ganimard
found
a
few
louis
there
were
no
marks
on
his
linen
or
on
his
clothes
the
trunks
a
big
box
and
two
bags
contained
nothing
but
personal
effects
there
was
a
bundle
of
newspapers
on
the
ganimard
opened
them
they
all
spoke
of
the
theft
of
the
jewish
lamp
an
hour
later
when
ganimard
and
shears
left
the
house
they
knew
no
more
about
the
strange
individual
whom
their
intervention
had
driven
to
suicide
who
was
he
why
had
he
taken
his
life
what
link
connected
him
with
the
disappearance
of
the
jewish
lamp
who
was
it
that
dogged
his
steps
during
his
walk
these
were
all
complicated
questions
so
many
mysteries
holmlock
shears
went
to
bed
in
a
very
bad
temper
when
he
woke
he
received
an
express
letter
couched
in
these
words
arsène
lupin
begs
to
inform
you
of
his
tragic
decease
in
the
person
of
one
bresson
and
requests
the
honour
of
your
company
at
his
funeral
which
will
take
place
at
the
public
expense
on
thursday
the
of
june
chapter
ii
you
see
old
chap
said
holmlock
shears
to
wilson
waving
arsène
lupin
letter
in
his
hand
the
worst
of
this
business
is
that
i
feel
the
confounded
fellow
eye
constantly
fixed
upon
me
not
one
of
my
most
secret
thoughts
escape
him
i
am
behaving
like
an
actor
whose
steps
are
ruled
by
the
strictest
who
moves
here
or
there
and
says
this
or
that
because
a
superior
will
has
so
determined
it
do
you
understand
wilson
wilson
would
no
doubt
have
understood
had
he
not
been
sleeping
the
sound
sleep
of
a
man
whose
temperature
is
fluctuating
between
and
degrees
but
whether
he
heard
or
not
made
no
difference
to
shears
who
continued
it
will
need
all
my
energy
and
all
my
resources
not
to
be
discouraged
fortunately
with
me
these
little
gibes
are
only
so
many
which
stimulate
me
to
further
exertions
once
the
sting
is
allayed
and
the
wound
in
my
closed
i
always
end
by
saying
away
my
lad
sooner
or
later
you
will
be
betrayed
by
your
own
hand
for
when
all
is
said
wilson
was
it
lupin
himself
who
with
his
first
telegram
and
the
reflection
which
it
suggested
to
that
little
henriette
revealed
to
me
the
secret
of
his
correspondence
with
alice
demun
you
forget
that
detail
old
chap
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
resounding
strides
at
the
risk
of
waking
old
chap
however
things
might
be
worse
and
though
the
paths
which
i
am
following
appear
a
little
dark
i
am
beginning
to
see
my
way
to
start
with
i
shall
soon
know
all
about
master
bresson
ganimard
and
i
have
an
appointment
on
the
bank
of
the
seine
at
the
spot
where
bresson
flung
his
parcel
and
we
shall
find
out
who
he
was
and
what
he
wanted
as
regards
the
rest
it
a
game
to
be
played
out
between
alice
demun
and
me
not
a
very
powerful
adversary
eh
wilson
and
do
you
think
i
shall
soon
know
the
sentence
in
the
album
and
what
those
two
single
letters
mean
the
c
and
the
h
for
the
whole
mystery
lies
in
that
wilson
at
this
moment
mademoiselle
entered
the
room
and
seeing
shears
wave
his
arms
about
said
shears
i
shall
be
very
angry
with
you
if
you
wake
my
patient
it
not
nice
of
you
to
disturb
him
the
doctor
insists
upon
absolute
calm
he
looked
at
her
without
a
word
astonished
as
on
the
first
day
at
her
inexplicable
composure
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
mr
shears
you
always
seem
to
have
something
at
the
back
of
your
mind
what
is
it
tell
me
please
she
questioned
him
with
all
her
bright
face
with
her
guileless
eyes
her
smiling
lips
and
with
her
attitude
too
her
hands
joined
together
her
body
bent
slightly
forward
and
so
great
was
her
candour
that
it
roused
the
englishman
anger
he
came
up
to
her
and
said
in
a
low
voice
bresson
committed
suicide
yesterday
she
repeated
without
appearing
to
understand
bresson
committed
suicide
yesterday
as
a
matter
of
fact
her
features
underwent
no
change
whatever
nothing
revealed
the
effort
of
a
lie
you
have
been
told
he
said
irritably
if
not
you
would
at
least
have
started
ah
you
are
cleverer
than
i
thought
but
why
pretend
he
took
the
which
he
had
placed
on
a
table
close
at
hand
and
opening
it
at
the
cut
page
can
you
tell
me
he
asked
in
what
order
i
am
to
arrange
the
letters
missing
here
so
that
i
may
understand
the
exact
purport
of
the
note
which
you
sent
to
bresson
four
days
before
the
theft
of
the
jewish
lamp
in
what
order
bresson
the
theft
of
the
jewish
lamp
she
repeated
the
words
slowly
as
though
to
make
out
their
meaning
he
insisted
yes
here
are
the
letters
you
used
on
this
scrap
of
paper
what
were
you
saying
to
bresson
the
letters
i
used
what
was
i
saying
to
suddenly
she
burst
out
laughing
i
see
i
understand
i
am
an
accomplice
in
the
theft
there
is
a
bresson
who
stole
the
jewish
lamp
and
killed
himself
and
i
am
the
gentleman
friend
oh
how
amusing
then
whom
did
you
go
to
see
yesterday
evening
on
the
second
floor
of
a
house
in
the
avenue
des
ternes
whom
why
my
dressmaker
mlle
langeais
do
you
mean
to
imply
that
my
dressmaker
and
my
friend
bresson
are
one
and
the
same
person
shears
began
to
doubt
in
spite
of
all
it
is
possible
to
counterfeit
almost
any
feeling
in
such
a
way
as
to
put
another
person
off
terror
joy
anxiety
but
not
indifference
not
happy
and
careless
laughter
however
he
said
one
last
word
why
did
you
accost
me
at
the
gare
du
nord
the
other
evening
and
why
did
you
beg
me
to
go
back
at
once
without
busying
myself
about
the
robbery
oh
you
much
too
curious
shears
she
replied
still
laughing
in
the
most
natural
way
to
punish
you
i
will
tell
you
nothing
and
in
addition
you
shall
watch
the
patient
while
i
go
to
the
chemist
there
an
urgent
prescription
to
be
made
up
i
must
hurry
she
left
the
room
i
have
been
tricked
muttered
shears
i
not
only
got
nothing
out
of
her
but
i
have
given
myself
away
and
he
remembered
the
case
of
the
blue
diamond
and
the
to
which
he
had
subjected
clotilde
destange
mademoiselle
had
encountered
him
with
the
same
serenity
as
the
blonde
lady
and
he
felt
that
he
was
again
face
to
face
with
one
of
those
creatures
who
protected
by
arsène
lupin
and
under
the
direct
action
of
his
influence
preserved
the
most
inscrutable
calmness
amid
the
very
agony
of
danger
shears
shears
it
was
wilson
calling
him
he
went
to
the
bed
and
bent
over
him
what
is
it
old
chap
feeling
bad
wilson
moved
his
lips
but
was
unable
to
speak
at
last
after
many
efforts
he
stammered
out
no
shears
it
was
she
it
ca
have
been
what
nonsense
are
you
talking
now
i
tell
you
that
it
was
she
only
when
i
in
the
presence
of
a
creature
of
lupin
trained
and
drilled
by
him
that
i
lose
my
head
and
behave
so
foolishly
she
now
knows
the
whole
story
of
the
album
i
bet
you
that
lupin
will
be
told
in
less
than
an
hour
less
than
an
hour
what
am
i
talking
about
this
moment
most
likely
the
chemist
the
urgent
prescription
humbug
without
a
further
thought
of
wilson
he
rushed
from
the
room
went
down
the
avenue
de
messine
and
saw
mademoiselle
enter
a
chemist
shop
she
came
out
ten
minutes
later
carrying
two
or
three
wrapped
up
in
white
paper
but
when
she
returned
up
the
avenue
she
was
accosted
by
a
man
who
followed
her
cap
in
hand
and
with
an
obsequious
air
as
though
he
were
begging
she
stopped
gave
him
an
alms
and
then
continued
on
her
way
she
spoke
to
him
said
the
englishman
to
himself
it
was
an
intuition
rather
than
a
certainty
but
strong
enough
to
induce
him
to
alter
his
tactics
leaving
the
girl
he
set
off
on
the
track
of
the
sham
beggar
they
arrived
in
this
way
one
behind
the
other
on
the
place
and
the
man
hovered
long
round
bresson
house
sometimes
raising
his
eyes
to
the
windows
and
watching
the
people
who
entered
the
house
at
the
end
of
an
hour
time
he
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
that
was
starting
for
neuilly
shears
climbed
up
also
and
sat
down
behind
the
fellow
at
some
little
distance
beside
a
gentleman
whose
features
were
concealed
by
the
newspaper
which
he
was
reading
when
they
reached
the
fortifications
the
newspaper
was
lowered
shears
recognized
ganimard
and
ganimard
pointing
to
the
fellow
said
in
his
ear
it
our
man
of
last
night
the
one
who
followed
bresson
he
been
hanging
round
the
square
for
an
hour
nothing
new
about
bresson
yes
a
letter
arrived
this
morning
addressed
to
him
this
morning
then
it
must
have
been
posted
yesterday
before
the
writer
knew
of
bresson
death
just
so
it
is
with
the
examining
magistrate
but
i
can
tell
you
the
exact
words
accepts
no
compromise
he
wants
everything
the
first
thing
as
well
as
those
of
the
second
business
if
not
he
will
take
steps
and
no
signature
added
ganimard
as
you
can
see
those
few
lines
wo
be
of
much
use
to
us
i
do
agree
with
you
at
all
ganimard
on
the
contrary
i
consider
them
very
interesting
and
why
bless
my
soul
for
reasons
personal
to
myself
said
shears
with
the
absence
of
ceremony
with
which
he
was
accustomed
to
treat
his
colleague
the
tram
stopped
at
the
terminus
in
the
rue
du
château
the
man
climbed
down
and
walked
away
quietly
shears
followed
so
closely
on
his
heels
that
ganimard
took
alarm
if
he
turns
round
we
are
done
he
wo
turn
round
now
what
do
you
know
about
it
he
is
an
accomplice
of
arsène
lupin
and
the
fact
that
an
accomplice
of
lupin
walks
away
like
that
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
proves
in
the
first
place
that
he
knows
he
followed
and
in
the
second
that
he
not
afraid
still
we
running
him
pretty
hard
no
matter
he
can
slip
through
our
fingers
in
a
minute
if
he
wants
he
too
sure
of
himself
come
come
you
getting
at
me
there
are
two
cyclist
police
at
the
door
of
that
café
over
there
if
i
decide
to
call
on
them
and
to
tackle
our
friend
i
should
like
to
know
how
he
going
to
slip
through
our
fingers
our
friend
does
not
seem
much
put
out
by
that
contingency
and
calling
on
them
himself
by
jupiter
said
ganimard
the
cheek
of
the
fellow
the
man
in
fact
had
walked
up
to
the
two
policemen
just
as
these
were
preparing
to
mount
their
bicycles
he
spoke
a
few
words
to
them
and
then
suddenly
sprang
upon
a
third
bicycle
which
was
leaning
against
the
wall
of
the
café
and
rode
away
quickly
with
the
two
policemen
the
englishman
burst
with
laughter
there
what
did
i
tell
you
off
before
we
knew
where
we
were
and
with
two
of
your
colleagues
ganimard
ah
he
looks
after
himself
does
arsène
lupin
with
cyclist
policemen
in
his
pay
did
i
tell
you
our
friend
was
a
great
deal
too
calm
what
then
cried
ganimard
angrily
what
could
i
do
it
very
easy
to
laugh
come
come
do
be
cross
we
have
our
revenge
for
the
moment
what
we
want
is
reinforcements
folenfant
is
waiting
for
me
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
de
neuilly
all
right
pick
him
up
and
join
me
both
of
you
ganimard
went
away
while
shears
followed
the
tracks
of
the
bicycles
which
were
easily
visible
on
the
dust
of
the
road
because
two
of
the
machines
were
fitted
with
grooved
tires
and
he
soon
saw
that
these
tracks
were
leading
him
to
the
bank
of
the
seine
and
that
the
three
men
had
turned
in
the
same
direction
as
bresson
on
the
previous
evening
he
thus
came
to
the
gate
against
which
he
himself
had
hidden
with
ganimard
and
a
little
farther
on
he
saw
a
tangle
of
grooved
lines
which
showed
that
they
had
stopped
there
just
opposite
a
little
neck
of
land
jutted
into
the
river
and
at
the
end
of
it
an
old
boat
lay
fastened
this
was
where
bresson
must
have
flung
his
parcel
or
rather
dropped
it
shears
went
down
the
incline
and
saw
that
as
the
bank
sloped
very
gently
and
the
water
was
low
he
would
easily
find
the
parcel
unless
the
three
men
had
been
there
first
no
no
he
said
to
himself
they
have
not
had
time
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
most
and
yet
why
did
they
come
this
way
a
man
was
sitting
in
the
boat
fishing
shears
asked
him
have
you
seen
three
men
on
bicycles
the
angler
shook
his
head
the
englishman
insisted
yes
yes
three
men
they
stopped
only
a
few
yards
from
where
you
are
the
angler
put
his
rod
under
his
arm
took
a
from
his
pocket
wrote
something
on
one
of
the
pages
tore
it
out
and
handed
it
to
shears
a
great
thrill
shook
the
englishman
at
a
glance
in
the
middle
of
the
page
which
he
held
in
his
hand
he
recognized
the
letters
torn
from
the
c
d
e
h
n
o
p
r
z
e
o
the
sun
hung
heavily
over
the
river
the
angler
had
resumed
his
work
sheltered
under
the
huge
brim
of
his
straw
hat
his
jacket
and
waistcoat
lay
folded
by
his
side
he
fished
attentively
while
the
float
of
his
line
rocked
idly
on
the
current
quite
a
minute
elapsed
a
minute
of
solemn
and
awful
silence
is
it
he
thought
shears
with
an
almost
painful
anxiety
and
then
the
truth
burst
upon
him
it
is
he
it
is
he
he
alone
is
capable
of
sitting
like
that
without
a
tremor
of
uneasiness
without
the
least
fear
as
to
what
will
happen
and
who
else
could
know
the
story
of
the
alice
must
have
told
him
by
her
messenger
suddenly
the
englishman
felt
that
his
hand
that
his
own
hand
had
seized
the
of
his
revolver
and
that
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
man
back
just
below
the
neck
one
movement
and
the
whole
play
was
finished
a
touch
of
the
trigger
and
the
life
of
the
strange
adventurer
had
come
to
a
miserable
end
the
angler
did
not
stir
shears
nervously
gripped
his
weapon
with
a
fierce
longing
to
fire
and
have
done
with
it
and
at
the
same
time
with
horror
of
a
deed
against
which
his
nature
revolted
death
was
certain
it
would
be
over
oh
he
thought
let
him
get
up
let
him
defend
himself
if
not
he
will
have
only
himself
to
blame
another
second
and
i
fire
but
a
sound
of
footsteps
made
him
turn
his
head
and
he
saw
ganimard
arrive
accompanied
by
the
inspectors
then
changing
his
idea
he
leapt
forward
sprang
at
one
bound
into
the
boat
breaking
the
painter
with
the
force
of
the
jump
fell
upon
the
man
and
held
him
in
a
close
embrace
they
both
rolled
to
the
bottom
of
the
boat
well
cried
lupin
struggling
and
then
what
does
this
prove
suppose
one
of
us
reduces
the
other
to
impotence
what
will
he
have
gained
you
will
not
know
what
to
do
with
me
nor
i
with
you
we
shall
stay
here
like
a
couple
of
fools
the
two
oars
slipped
into
the
water
the
boat
began
to
drift
mingled
exclamations
resounded
along
the
bank
and
lupin
continued
lord
what
a
business
have
you
lost
all
sense
of
things
fancy
being
so
silly
at
your
age
you
great
schoolboy
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
he
succeeded
in
releasing
himself
exasperated
resolved
to
stick
at
nothing
shears
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
an
oath
escaped
him
lupin
had
taken
his
revolver
then
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
and
tried
to
catch
hold
of
one
of
the
oars
in
order
to
pull
to
the
shore
while
lupin
made
desperate
efforts
after
the
other
in
order
to
pull
out
to
got
it
missed
it
said
lupin
however
it
makes
no
difference
if
you
get
your
oar
i
prevent
your
using
it
and
you
do
as
much
for
me
but
there
in
life
we
strive
to
act
without
the
least
reason
for
it
always
fate
that
decides
there
you
see
fate
well
she
deciding
for
her
old
friend
lupin
victory
the
current
favouring
me
the
boat
in
fact
was
drifting
away
look
out
cried
lupin
some
one
on
the
bank
pointed
a
revolver
lupin
ducked
his
head
a
shot
rang
out
a
little
water
spurted
up
around
them
he
burst
out
laughing
heaven
help
us
it
friend
ganimard
now
that
very
wrong
of
you
ganimard
you
have
no
right
to
fire
except
in
does
poor
arsène
make
you
so
furious
that
you
forget
your
duties
hullo
starting
again
but
wretched
man
be
careful
you
hit
my
dear
maître
here
he
made
a
bulwark
of
his
body
for
shears
and
standing
up
in
the
boat
facing
ganimard
there
now
i
do
mind
aim
here
ganimard
straight
at
my
heart
higher
to
the
left
missed
again
you
clumsy
beggar
another
shot
but
you
trembling
ganimard
at
the
word
of
command
eh
and
steady
now
one
two
three
fire
missed
dash
it
all
does
the
government
give
you
toys
for
pistols
he
produced
a
long
massive
flat
revolver
and
fired
without
taking
aim
the
inspector
lifted
his
hand
to
his
hat
a
bullet
had
made
a
hole
through
it
what
do
you
say
to
that
ganimard
ah
this
is
a
better
make
hats
off
gentlemen
this
is
the
revolver
of
my
noble
friend
maître
holmlock
shears
and
he
tossed
the
weapon
to
the
bank
right
at
the
inspector
feet
shears
could
not
help
giving
a
smile
of
admiration
what
superabundant
life
what
young
and
spontaneous
gladness
and
how
he
seemed
to
enjoy
himself
it
was
as
though
the
sense
of
danger
gave
him
a
physical
delight
as
though
life
had
no
other
object
for
this
extraordinary
man
than
the
search
of
dangers
which
he
amused
himself
afterward
by
averting
meantime
crowds
had
gathered
on
either
side
of
the
river
and
ganimard
and
his
men
were
following
the
craft
which
swung
down
the
stream
carried
very
slowly
by
the
current
it
meant
inevitable
mathematical
capture
confess
maître
cried
lupin
turning
to
the
englishman
that
you
would
not
give
up
your
seat
for
all
the
gold
in
the
transvaal
you
are
in
the
first
row
of
the
stalls
but
first
and
before
all
the
prologue
after
which
we
will
skip
straight
to
the
fifth
act
the
capture
or
the
escape
of
arsène
lupin
therefore
my
dear
maître
i
have
one
request
to
make
of
you
and
i
beg
you
to
answer
yes
or
no
to
save
all
ambiguity
cease
interesting
yourself
in
this
business
there
is
yet
time
and
i
am
still
able
to
repair
the
harm
which
you
have
done
later
on
i
shall
not
be
do
you
agree
no
lupin
features
contracted
this
obstinacy
was
causing
him
visible
annoyance
he
resumed
i
insist
i
insist
even
more
for
your
sake
than
my
own
for
i
am
certain
that
you
will
be
the
first
to
regret
your
interference
once
more
yes
or
no
no
lupin
squatted
on
his
heels
shifted
one
of
the
planks
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
for
a
few
minutes
worked
at
something
which
shears
could
not
see
then
he
rose
sat
down
beside
the
englishman
and
spoke
to
him
in
these
words
i
believe
maître
that
you
and
i
came
to
the
with
the
same
purpose
that
of
fishing
up
the
object
which
bresson
got
rid
of
did
we
not
i
for
my
part
had
made
an
appointment
to
meet
a
few
friends
and
i
was
on
the
point
as
my
scanty
costume
shows
of
effecting
a
little
exploration
in
the
depths
of
the
seine
when
my
friends
gave
me
notice
of
your
approach
i
am
bound
to
confess
that
i
was
not
surprised
having
been
kept
informed
i
venture
to
say
hourly
of
the
progress
of
your
inquiry
it
is
so
easy
as
soon
as
the
least
thing
likely
to
interest
me
occurs
in
the
rue
murillo
quick
they
ring
me
up
and
i
know
all
about
it
you
can
understand
that
in
these
conditions
he
stopped
the
plank
which
he
had
removed
now
rose
a
trifle
and
water
was
filtering
in
all
around
in
driblets
the
deuce
i
do
know
how
i
managed
it
but
i
have
every
reason
to
think
that
there
a
leak
in
this
old
boat
you
not
afraid
maître
shears
shrugged
his
shoulders
lupin
continued
you
can
understand
therefore
that
in
these
conditions
and
knowing
beforehand
that
you
would
seek
the
contest
all
the
more
greedily
the
more
i
strove
to
avoid
it
i
was
rather
pleased
at
the
idea
of
playing
a
rubber
with
you
the
result
of
which
is
certain
seeing
that
i
hold
all
the
trumps
and
i
wished
to
give
our
meeting
the
greatest
possible
publicity
so
that
your
defeat
might
be
universally
known
and
no
new
comtesse
de
crozon
nor
baron
be
tempted
to
solicit
your
aid
against
me
and
in
all
this
my
dear
maître
you
must
not
see
he
interrupted
himself
again
and
using
his
hands
as
a
he
watched
the
banks
by
jove
they
freighted
a
splendid
cutter
a
regular
boat
and
they
rowing
like
anything
in
five
minutes
they
will
board
us
and
i
shall
be
lost
shears
let
me
give
you
one
piece
of
advice
throw
yourself
upon
me
tie
me
hand
and
foot
and
deliver
me
to
the
law
of
my
country
does
that
suit
you
unless
we
suffer
shipwreck
meanwhile
in
which
case
there
will
be
nothing
for
us
to
do
but
make
our
wills
what
do
you
say
their
eyes
met
this
time
shears
understood
lupin
operations
he
had
made
a
hole
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
the
water
was
rising
it
reached
the
soles
of
their
boots
it
covered
their
feet
they
did
not
move
it
came
above
their
ankles
the
englishman
took
his
rolled
a
cigarette
and
lit
it
lupin
continued
and
in
all
this
my
dear
maître
you
must
not
see
anything
more
than
the
humble
confession
of
my
powerlessness
in
face
of
you
it
is
tantamount
to
yielding
to
you
when
i
accept
only
those
contests
in
which
my
victory
is
assured
in
order
to
avoid
those
of
which
i
shall
not
have
selected
the
field
it
is
tantamount
to
recognizing
that
holmlock
shears
is
the
only
enemy
whom
i
fear
and
proclaiming
my
anxiety
as
long
as
shears
is
not
removed
from
my
path
this
my
dear
maître
is
what
i
wished
to
tell
you
on
this
one
occasion
when
fate
has
allowed
me
the
honour
of
a
conversation
with
you
i
regret
only
one
thing
which
is
that
this
conversation
should
take
place
while
we
are
having
a
a
position
lacking
in
dignity
i
must
confess
and
what
was
i
saying
a
a
rather
the
water
in
fact
had
reached
the
seat
on
which
they
were
sitting
and
the
boat
sank
lower
and
lower
in
the
water
shears
sat
imperturbable
his
cigarette
at
his
lips
apparently
wrapped
in
contemplation
of
the
sky
for
nothing
in
the
world
in
the
face
of
that
man
surrounded
by
dangers
hemmed
in
by
the
crowd
hunted
down
by
a
posse
of
police
and
yet
always
retaining
his
good
humour
for
nothing
in
the
world
would
he
have
consented
to
display
the
least
sign
of
agitation
what
they
both
seemed
to
be
saying
do
people
get
excited
about
such
trifles
is
it
not
a
daily
occurrence
to
get
drowned
in
a
river
is
this
the
sort
of
event
that
deserves
to
be
noticed
and
the
one
chattered
and
the
other
mused
while
both
concealed
under
the
same
mask
of
indifference
the
formidable
clash
of
their
respective
prides
another
minute
and
they
would
sink
the
essential
thing
said
lupin
is
to
know
if
we
shall
sink
before
or
after
the
arrival
of
the
champions
of
the
law
all
depends
upon
that
for
the
question
of
shipwreck
is
no
longer
in
doubt
maître
the
solemn
moment
has
come
to
make
our
wills
i
leave
all
my
real
and
personal
estate
to
holmlock
shears
a
citizen
of
the
british
empire
but
by
jove
how
fast
they
are
coming
those
champions
of
the
law
oh
the
dear
people
it
a
pleasure
to
watch
them
what
precision
of
stroke
ah
is
that
you
sergeant
folenfant
well
done
that
idea
of
the
cutter
was
capital
i
shall
recommend
you
to
your
superiors
sergeant
folenfant
and
were
you
hoping
for
a
medal
right
you
are
consider
it
yours
and
where
your
friend
dieuzy
on
the
left
bank
i
suppose
in
the
midst
of
a
hundred
natives
so
that
if
i
escape
shipwreck
i
shall
be
picked
up
on
the
left
by
dieuzy
and
his
natives
or
else
on
the
right
by
ganimard
and
the
neuilly
tribes
a
nasty
dilemma
there
was
an
eddy
the
boat
swung
round
and
shears
was
obliged
to
cling
to
the
row
locks
maître
said
lupin
i
beg
of
you
to
take
off
your
jacket
you
will
be
more
comfortable
for
swimming
you
wo
then
i
shall
put
on
mine
again
he
slipped
on
his
jacket
buttoned
it
tightly
like
shears
and
sighed
what
a
fine
fellow
you
are
and
what
a
pity
that
you
should
persist
in
a
business
in
which
you
are
certainly
doing
the
very
best
you
can
but
all
in
vain
really
you
are
throwing
away
your
distinguished
talent
lupin
said
shears
at
last
abandoning
his
silence
you
talk
a
great
deal
too
much
and
you
often
err
through
excessive
confidence
and
frivolity
that
a
serious
reproach
it
was
in
this
way
that
without
knowing
it
you
supplied
me
a
moment
ago
with
the
information
i
wanted
what
you
wanted
some
information
and
you
never
told
me
i
do
require
you
or
anybody
in
three
hours
time
i
shall
hand
the
solution
of
the
puzzle
to
and
reply
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
the
boat
had
suddenly
foundered
dragging
them
both
with
her
she
rose
to
the
surface
at
once
overturned
with
her
keel
in
the
air
loud
shouts
came
from
the
two
banks
followed
by
an
anxious
silence
and
suddenly
fresh
cries
one
of
the
shipwrecked
men
had
reappeared
it
was
holmlock
shears
an
excellent
swimmer
he
struck
out
boldly
for
folenfant
boat
cheerly
mr
shears
roared
the
you
all
right
keep
on
we
see
about
him
afterward
we
got
him
right
enough
one
more
effort
shears
catch
hold
the
englishman
seized
a
rope
which
they
threw
to
him
but
while
they
were
dragging
him
on
board
a
voice
behind
him
called
out
yes
my
dear
maître
you
shall
have
the
solution
i
am
even
surprised
that
you
have
not
hit
upon
it
already
and
then
what
use
will
it
be
to
you
it
just
then
that
you
will
have
lost
the
battle
seated
comfortably
astride
the
hulk
of
which
he
had
scaled
the
sides
while
talking
arsène
lupin
continued
his
speech
with
solemn
gestures
and
as
though
he
hoped
to
convince
his
hearers
do
you
understand
my
dear
maître
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
absolutely
nothing
you
are
in
the
deplorable
position
of
a
gentleman
who
folenfant
took
aim
at
him
lupin
surrender
you
an
person
sergeant
folenfant
you
interrupted
me
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
i
was
saying
lupin
surrender
but
dash
it
all
sergeant
folenfant
one
only
surrenders
when
in
danger
now
surely
you
have
not
the
face
to
believe
that
i
am
running
the
least
danger
for
the
last
time
lupin
i
call
on
you
to
surrender
sergeant
folenfant
you
have
not
the
smallest
intention
of
killing
me
at
the
most
you
mean
to
wound
me
you
so
afraid
of
my
escaping
and
supposing
that
by
accident
the
wound
should
be
mortal
oh
think
of
your
remorse
wretched
man
of
your
blighted
old
age
the
shot
went
off
lupin
staggered
clung
for
a
moment
to
the
overturned
boat
then
let
go
and
disappeared
it
was
just
three
when
these
events
happened
at
six
precisely
as
he
had
declared
holmlock
shears
clad
in
a
pair
of
trousers
too
short
and
a
jacket
too
tight
for
him
which
he
had
borrowed
from
an
at
neuilly
and
wearing
a
cap
and
a
flannel
shirt
with
a
silk
cord
and
tassels
entered
the
boudoir
in
the
rue
murillo
after
sending
word
to
and
mme
to
ask
for
an
interview
they
found
him
walking
up
and
down
and
he
looked
to
them
so
comical
in
his
queer
costume
that
they
had
a
difficulty
in
suppressing
their
inclination
to
laugh
with
a
pensive
air
and
a
bent
back
he
walked
like
an
automaton
from
the
window
to
the
door
and
the
door
to
the
window
taking
each
time
the
same
number
of
steps
and
turning
each
time
in
the
same
direction
he
stopped
took
up
a
examined
it
mechanically
and
then
resumed
his
walk
at
last
planting
himself
in
front
of
them
he
asked
is
mademoiselle
here
yes
in
the
garden
with
the
children
monsieur
le
baron
as
this
will
be
our
final
conversation
i
should
like
mlle
demun
to
be
present
at
it
so
you
decidedly
have
a
little
patience
monsieur
the
truth
will
emerge
plainly
from
the
facts
which
i
propose
to
lay
before
you
with
the
greatest
possible
precision
very
well
suzanne
do
you
mind
mme
rose
and
returned
almost
at
once
accompanied
by
alice
demun
mademoiselle
looking
a
little
paler
than
usual
remained
standing
leaning
against
a
table
and
without
even
asking
to
know
why
she
had
been
sent
for
shears
appeared
not
to
see
her
and
turning
abruptly
toward
made
his
statement
in
a
tone
that
admitted
of
no
reply
after
an
inquiry
extending
over
several
days
and
although
certain
events
for
a
moment
altered
my
view
i
will
repeat
what
i
said
from
the
first
that
the
jewish
lamp
was
stolen
by
some
one
living
in
this
house
the
name
i
know
it
your
evidence
the
evidence
which
i
have
is
enough
to
confound
the
culprit
it
is
not
enough
that
the
culprit
should
be
confounded
he
must
restore
the
jewish
lamp
it
is
in
my
possession
the
opal
necklace
the
the
opal
necklace
the
in
short
everything
that
was
stolen
on
the
second
occasion
is
in
my
possession
shears
loved
this
dry
claptrap
way
of
announcing
his
triumphs
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
baron
and
his
wife
seemed
stupefied
and
looked
at
him
with
a
silent
curiosity
which
was
in
itself
the
highest
praise
he
next
summed
up
in
detail
all
that
he
had
done
during
those
three
days
he
told
how
he
had
discovered
the
wrote
down
on
a
sheet
of
paper
the
sentence
formed
by
the
letters
which
had
been
cut
out
then
described
bresson
expedition
to
the
bank
of
the
seine
and
his
suicide
and
lastly
the
struggle
in
which
he
shears
had
just
been
engaged
with
lupin
the
wreck
of
the
boat
and
lupin
disappearance
when
he
had
finished
the
baron
said
in
a
low
voice
nothing
remains
but
that
you
should
reveal
the
name
of
the
thief
whom
do
you
accuse
i
accuse
the
person
who
cut
out
the
letters
from
this
alphabet
and
communicated
by
means
of
those
letters
with
arsène
lupin
how
do
you
know
that
this
person
correspondent
was
arsène
lupin
from
lupin
himself
he
held
out
a
scrap
of
moist
and
crumpled
paper
it
was
the
page
which
lupin
had
torn
from
his
in
the
boat
and
on
which
he
had
written
the
sentence
and
observe
said
shears
in
a
gratified
voice
that
there
was
nothing
to
compel
him
to
give
me
this
paper
and
thus
make
himself
known
it
was
a
mere
schoolboy
prank
on
his
part
which
gave
me
the
information
i
wanted
what
information
asked
the
baron
i
do
see
shears
copied
out
the
letters
and
figures
in
pencil
c
d
e
h
n
o
p
r
z
e
o
well
said
that
the
formula
which
you
have
just
shown
us
yourself
no
if
you
had
turned
this
formula
over
and
over
as
i
have
done
you
would
have
seen
at
once
that
it
contains
two
more
letters
than
the
first
an
e
and
an
o
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
not
notice
place
these
two
letters
beside
the
c
and
h
which
remained
over
from
the
word
and
you
will
see
that
the
only
possible
word
is
which
means
which
means
the
de
lupin
newspaper
his
own
organ
the
one
for
which
he
reserves
his
official
communications
reply
to
the
de
agony
column
no
that
was
the
key
for
which
i
had
hunted
so
long
and
with
which
lupin
was
kind
enough
to
supply
me
i
have
just
come
from
the
office
of
the
de
and
what
have
you
found
i
have
found
the
whole
detailed
story
of
the
relations
between
arsène
lupin
and
his
accomplice
and
shears
spread
out
seven
newspapers
opened
at
the
fourth
page
and
picked
out
the
following
lines
ars
lup
lady
impl
protect
awaiting
explanations
under
dominion
of
enemy
lost
write
address
will
make
enq
murillo
park
violets
agreed
sat
shall
be
park
sun
morn
and
you
call
that
a
detailed
story
exclaimed
why
of
course
and
if
you
will
pay
attention
you
will
think
the
same
first
of
all
a
lady
signing
herself
implores
the
protection
of
arsène
lupin
to
this
lupin
replies
with
a
request
for
explanations
the
lady
answers
that
she
is
under
the
dominion
of
an
enemy
bresson
no
doubt
and
that
she
is
lost
unless
some
one
comes
to
her
assistance
lupin
who
is
suspicious
and
dares
not
yet
have
an
interview
with
the
stranger
asks
for
the
address
and
suggests
an
inquiry
the
lady
hesitates
for
four
days
see
the
dates
and
at
last
under
the
pressure
of
events
and
the
influence
of
bresson
threats
gives
the
name
of
her
street
the
rue
murillo
the
next
day
arsène
lupin
advertises
that
he
will
be
in
the
parc
monceau
at
three
and
asks
the
stranger
to
wear
a
bunch
of
violets
as
a
token
here
follows
an
interruption
of
eight
days
in
the
correspondence
arsène
lupin
and
the
lady
no
longer
need
write
through
the
medium
of
the
paper
they
see
each
other
or
correspond
direct
the
plot
is
contrived
to
satisfy
requirements
the
lady
will
take
the
jewish
lamp
it
remains
to
fix
the
day
the
lady
who
from
motives
of
prudence
corresponds
by
means
of
words
cut
out
and
stuck
together
decides
upon
saturday
and
adds
reply
lupin
replies
that
it
is
agreed
and
that
moreover
he
will
be
in
the
park
on
sunday
morning
on
sunday
morning
the
theft
took
place
yes
everything
fits
in
said
the
baron
approvingly
and
the
story
is
complete
shears
continued
so
the
theft
took
place
the
lady
goes
out
on
sunday
morning
tells
lupin
what
she
has
done
and
carries
the
jewish
lamp
to
bresson
things
then
happen
as
lupin
foresaw
the
police
misled
by
an
open
window
four
holes
in
the
ground
and
two
scratches
on
a
balcony
at
once
accept
the
burglary
suggestion
the
lady
is
easy
in
her
mind
very
well
said
the
baron
i
accept
this
explanation
as
perfectly
logical
but
the
second
theft
the
second
theft
was
provoked
by
the
first
after
the
newspapers
had
told
how
the
jewish
lamp
had
disappeared
some
one
thought
of
returning
to
the
attack
and
seizing
hold
of
everything
that
had
not
been
carried
away
and
this
time
it
was
not
a
pretended
theft
but
a
real
theft
with
a
genuine
burglary
ladders
and
so
on
lupin
of
course
no
lupin
does
not
act
so
stupidly
lupin
does
not
fire
at
people
without
very
good
reason
then
who
was
it
bresson
no
doubt
unknown
to
the
lady
whom
he
had
been
blackmailing
it
was
bresson
who
broke
in
here
whom
i
pursued
who
wounded
my
poor
wilson
are
you
quite
sure
absolutely
one
of
bresson
accomplices
wrote
him
a
letter
yesterday
before
his
suicide
which
shows
that
this
accomplice
and
lupin
had
entered
upon
a
parley
for
the
restitution
of
all
the
articles
stolen
from
your
house
lupin
demanded
everything
first
thing
that
is
to
say
the
jewish
lamp
well
as
those
of
the
second
business
moreover
he
watched
bresson
when
bresson
went
to
the
bank
of
the
seine
yesterday
evening
one
of
lupin
associates
was
dogging
him
at
the
same
time
as
ourselves
what
was
bresson
doing
at
the
bank
of
the
seine
warned
of
the
progress
of
my
inquiry
warned
by
whom
by
the
same
lady
who
very
rightly
feared
lest
the
discovery
of
the
jewish
lamp
should
entail
the
discovery
of
her
adventure
bresson
therefore
warned
collected
into
one
parcel
all
that
might
compromise
him
and
dropped
it
in
a
place
where
it
would
be
possible
for
him
to
recover
it
once
the
danger
was
past
it
was
on
his
return
that
hunted
down
by
ganimard
and
me
and
doubtless
having
other
crimes
on
his
conscience
he
lost
his
head
and
shot
himself
but
what
did
the
parcel
contain
the
jewish
lamp
and
your
other
things
then
they
are
not
in
your
possession
immediately
after
lupin
disappearance
i
took
advantage
of
the
bath
which
he
had
compelled
me
to
take
to
drive
to
the
spot
chosen
by
bresson
and
i
found
your
stolen
property
wrapped
up
in
linen
and
here
it
is
on
the
table
without
a
word
the
baron
cut
the
string
tore
through
the
pieces
of
wet
linen
took
out
the
lamp
turned
a
screw
under
the
foot
pressed
with
both
hands
on
the
receiver
opened
it
into
two
equal
parts
and
revealed
the
golden
chimera
set
with
rubies
and
emeralds
it
was
untouched
in
all
this
scene
apparently
so
natural
and
consisting
of
a
simple
statement
of
facts
there
was
something
that
made
it
terribly
tragic
which
was
the
formal
direct
irrefutable
accusation
which
shears
hurled
at
mademoiselle
with
every
word
he
uttered
and
there
was
also
alice
demun
impressive
silence
during
that
long
that
cruel
accumulation
of
small
proofs
not
a
muscle
of
her
face
had
moved
not
a
gleam
of
rebellion
or
fear
had
disturbed
the
serenity
of
her
limpid
glance
what
was
she
thinking
and
still
more
what
would
she
say
at
the
solemn
moment
when
she
must
reply
when
she
must
defend
herself
and
break
the
iron
circle
in
which
the
englishman
had
so
cleverly
imprisoned
her
the
moment
had
struck
and
the
girl
was
silent
speak
speak
cried
she
did
not
speak
he
insisted
one
word
will
clear
you
one
word
of
protest
and
i
will
believe
you
that
word
she
did
not
utter
the
baron
stepped
briskly
across
the
room
returned
went
back
again
and
then
addressing
shears
well
no
sir
i
refuse
to
believe
it
true
there
are
some
crimes
which
are
impossible
and
this
is
opposed
to
all
that
i
know
all
that
i
have
seen
for
a
year
he
put
his
hand
on
the
englishman
shoulder
but
are
you
yourself
sir
absolutely
and
definitely
sure
that
you
are
not
mistaken
shears
hesitated
like
a
man
attacked
unawares
who
does
not
defend
himself
at
once
however
he
smiled
and
said
no
one
but
the
person
whom
i
accuse
could
thanks
to
the
position
which
she
fills
in
your
house
know
that
the
jewish
lamp
contained
that
magnificent
jewel
i
refuse
to
believe
it
muttered
the
baron
ask
her
it
was
in
fact
the
one
thing
which
he
had
not
tried
in
the
blind
confidence
which
he
felt
in
the
girl
but
it
was
no
longer
permissible
to
deny
the
evidence
he
went
up
to
her
and
looking
her
straight
in
the
eyes
was
it
you
mademoiselle
did
you
take
the
jewel
did
you
correspond
with
arsène
lupin
and
sham
the
burglary
she
replied
yes
monsieur
she
did
not
lower
her
head
her
face
expressed
neither
shame
nor
embarrassment
is
it
possible
stammered
i
would
never
have
believed
you
are
the
last
person
i
should
have
suspected
how
did
you
do
it
unhappy
girl
she
said
i
did
as
shears
has
said
on
saturday
night
i
came
down
here
to
the
boudoir
took
the
lamp
and
in
the
morning
carried
it
to
that
man
but
no
objected
the
baron
what
you
say
is
impossible
impossible
why
because
i
found
the
door
of
the
boudoir
locked
in
the
morning
she
coloured
lost
countenance
and
looked
at
shears
as
though
to
ask
his
advice
the
englishman
seemed
struck
by
alice
embarrassment
even
more
than
by
the
baron
objection
had
she
then
no
reply
to
make
did
the
confession
that
confirmed
the
explanation
which
he
shears
had
given
of
the
theft
of
the
jewish
lamp
conceal
a
lie
which
an
examination
of
the
facts
at
once
laid
bare
the
baron
continued
the
door
was
locked
i
repeat
i
declare
that
i
found
the
bolt
as
i
left
it
at
night
if
you
had
come
that
way
as
you
pretend
someone
must
have
opened
the
door
to
you
from
the
inside
that
is
to
say
from
the
boudoir
or
from
our
bedroom
now
there
was
no
one
in
these
two
rooms
no
one
except
my
wife
and
myself
shears
bent
down
quickly
and
covered
his
face
with
his
two
hands
to
hide
it
he
had
flushed
scarlet
something
resembling
too
sudden
a
light
had
struck
him
and
left
him
dazed
and
ill
at
ease
the
whole
stood
revealed
to
him
like
a
dim
landscape
from
which
the
darkness
was
suddenly
lifting
alice
demun
was
innocent
alice
demun
was
innocent
that
was
a
certain
blinding
fact
and
at
the
same
time
explained
the
sort
of
embarrassment
which
he
had
felt
since
the
first
day
at
directing
the
terrible
accusation
against
this
young
girl
he
saw
clearly
now
he
knew
it
needed
but
a
movement
and
then
and
there
the
irrefutable
proof
would
stand
forth
before
him
he
raised
his
head
and
after
a
few
seconds
as
naturally
as
he
could
turned
his
eyes
toward
mme
she
was
pale
with
that
unaccustomed
pallor
that
overcomes
us
at
the
relentless
hours
of
life
her
hands
which
she
strove
to
hide
trembled
imperceptibly
another
second
thought
shears
and
she
will
have
betrayed
herself
he
placed
himself
between
her
and
her
husband
with
the
imperious
longing
to
ward
off
the
terrible
danger
which
through
his
fault
threatened
this
man
and
this
woman
but
at
the
sight
of
the
baron
he
shuddered
to
the
very
depths
of
his
being
the
same
sudden
revelation
which
had
dazzled
him
with
its
brilliancy
was
now
enlightening
the
same
thought
was
working
in
the
husband
brain
he
understood
in
his
turn
he
saw
desperately
alice
demun
strove
to
resist
the
implacable
truth
you
are
right
monsieur
i
made
a
mistake
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
not
come
in
this
way
i
went
through
the
hall
and
the
garden
and
with
the
help
of
a
ladder
it
was
a
supreme
effort
of
devotion
but
a
useless
effort
the
words
did
not
ring
true
the
voice
had
lost
its
assurance
and
the
sweet
girl
was
no
longer
able
to
retain
her
limpid
glance
and
her
great
air
of
sincerity
she
hung
her
head
defeated
the
silence
was
frightful
mme
waited
her
features
livid
and
drawn
with
anguish
and
fear
the
baron
seemed
to
be
still
struggling
as
though
refusing
to
believe
in
the
downfall
of
his
happiness
at
last
he
stammered
speak
explain
yourself
i
have
nothing
to
say
my
poor
friend
she
said
in
a
very
low
voice
her
features
wrung
with
despair
then
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
saved
me
through
devotion
through
affection
and
accused
herself
saved
you
from
what
from
whom
from
that
man
bresson
yes
he
held
me
by
his
threats
i
met
him
at
a
friend
house
and
i
had
the
madness
to
listen
to
him
oh
there
was
nothing
that
you
can
not
forgive
but
i
wrote
him
two
letters
you
shall
see
them
i
bought
them
back
you
know
how
oh
have
pity
on
me
i
have
been
so
unhappy
you
you
suzanne
he
raised
his
clenched
fists
to
her
ready
to
beat
her
ready
to
kill
her
but
his
arms
fell
to
his
sides
and
he
murmured
again
you
suzanne
you
is
it
possible
in
short
abrupt
sentences
she
told
the
heartbreaking
and
commonplace
story
her
terrified
awakening
in
the
face
of
the
man
infamy
her
remorse
her
madness
and
she
also
described
alice
admirable
conduct
the
girl
suspecting
her
mistress
despair
forcing
a
confession
from
her
writing
to
lupin
and
contriving
this
story
of
a
robbery
to
save
her
from
bresson
clutches
you
suzanne
you
repeated
bent
double
overwhelmed
how
could
you
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
the
steamer
de
from
calais
to
dover
was
gliding
slowly
over
the
motionless
water
the
night
was
dark
and
calm
peaceful
clouds
were
suggested
rather
than
seen
above
the
boat
and
all
around
light
veils
of
mist
separated
her
from
the
infinite
space
in
which
the
moon
and
stars
were
shedding
their
cold
but
invisible
radiance
most
of
the
passengers
had
gone
to
the
cabins
and
saloons
a
few
of
them
however
bolder
than
the
rest
were
walking
up
and
down
the
deck
or
else
dozing
under
thick
rugs
in
the
big
here
and
there
the
gleam
showed
of
a
cigar
and
mingling
with
the
gentle
breath
of
the
wind
came
the
murmur
of
voices
that
dared
not
rise
high
in
the
great
solemn
silence
one
of
the
passengers
who
was
walking
to
and
fro
with
even
strides
stopped
beside
a
person
stretched
out
on
a
bench
looked
at
her
and
when
she
moved
slightly
said
i
thought
you
were
asleep
mlle
alice
no
shears
i
do
not
feel
sleepy
i
was
thinking
what
of
is
it
indiscreet
to
ask
i
was
thinking
of
mme
how
sad
she
must
be
her
life
is
ruined
not
at
all
not
at
all
he
said
eagerly
her
fault
is
not
one
of
those
which
can
never
be
forgiven
will
forget
that
lapse
already
when
we
left
he
was
looking
at
her
less
harshly
perhaps
but
it
will
take
long
to
forget
and
she
is
suffering
are
you
very
fond
of
her
very
that
gave
me
such
strength
to
smile
when
i
was
trembling
with
fear
to
look
you
in
the
face
when
i
wanted
to
avoid
your
glance
and
are
you
unhappy
at
leaving
her
most
unhappy
i
have
no
relations
or
friends
i
had
only
her
you
shall
have
friends
said
the
englishman
whom
this
grief
was
upsetting
i
promise
you
that
i
have
connections
i
have
much
influence
i
assure
you
that
you
will
not
regret
your
position
perhaps
but
mme
will
not
be
there
they
exchanged
no
more
words
holmlock
shears
took
two
or
three
more
turns
along
the
deck
and
then
came
back
and
settled
down
near
his
the
misty
curtain
lifted
and
the
clouds
seemed
to
part
in
the
sky
stars
twinkled
up
above
shears
took
his
pipe
from
the
pocket
of
his
inverness
cape
filled
it
and
struck
four
matches
one
after
the
other
without
succeeding
in
lighting
it
as
he
had
none
left
he
rose
and
said
to
a
gentleman
seated
a
few
steps
off
could
you
oblige
me
with
a
light
please
the
gentleman
opened
a
box
of
fusees
and
struck
one
a
flame
blazed
up
by
its
light
shears
saw
arsène
lupin
if
the
englishman
had
not
given
a
tiny
movement
an
almost
imperceptible
movement
of
recoil
lupin
might
have
thought
that
his
presence
on
board
was
known
to
him
so
great
was
the
mastery
which
shears
retained
over
himself
and
so
natural
the
ease
with
which
he
held
out
his
hand
to
his
adversary
keeping
well
m
lupin
bravo
exclaimed
lupin
from
whom
this
drew
a
cry
of
admiration
bravo
what
for
what
for
you
see
me
reappear
before
you
like
a
ghost
after
witnessing
my
dive
into
the
seine
and
from
pride
from
a
miraculous
pride
which
i
will
call
essentially
british
you
give
not
a
movement
of
astonishment
you
utter
not
a
word
of
surprise
upon
my
word
i
repeat
bravo
admirable
there
nothing
admirable
about
it
from
the
way
you
fell
off
the
boat
i
could
see
that
you
fell
of
your
own
accord
and
that
you
had
not
been
struck
by
the
sergeant
shot
and
you
went
away
without
knowing
what
became
of
me
what
became
of
you
i
knew
five
hundred
people
were
commanding
the
two
banks
over
a
distance
of
of
a
mile
once
you
escaped
death
your
capture
was
certain
and
yet
i
here
lupin
there
are
two
men
in
the
world
of
whom
nothing
can
astonish
me
myself
first
and
you
next
peace
was
concluded
if
shears
had
failed
in
his
undertakings
against
arsène
lupin
if
lupin
remained
the
exceptional
enemy
whom
he
must
definitely
renounce
all
attempts
to
capture
if
in
the
course
of
the
engagements
lupin
always
preserved
his
superiority
the
englishman
had
nevertheless
thanks
to
his
formidable
tenacity
recovered
the
jewish
lamp
just
as
he
had
recovered
the
blue
diamond
perhaps
this
time
the
result
was
less
brilliant
especially
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
public
since
shears
was
obliged
to
suppress
the
circumstances
in
which
the
jewish
lamp
had
been
discovered
and
to
proclaim
that
he
did
not
know
the
culprit
name
but
as
between
man
and
man
between
lupin
and
shears
between
burglar
and
detective
there
was
in
all
fairness
neither
victor
nor
vanquished
each
of
them
could
lay
claim
to
equal
triumphs
they
talked
therefore
like
courteous
adversaries
who
have
laid
down
their
arms
and
who
esteem
each
other
at
their
true
worth
at
shears
request
lupin
described
his
escape
if
indeed
he
said
you
can
call
it
an
escape
it
was
so
simple
my
friends
were
on
the
watch
since
we
had
arranged
to
meet
in
order
to
fish
up
the
jewish
lamp
and
so
after
remaining
a
good
under
the
overturned
keel
of
the
boat
i
took
advantage
of
a
moment
when
folenfant
and
his
men
were
looking
for
my
corpse
along
the
banks
and
i
climbed
on
to
the
wreck
again
my
friends
had
only
to
pick
me
up
in
their
and
to
dash
off
before
the
astounded
eyes
of
the
five
hundred
sightseers
ganimard
and
folenfant
very
pretty
cried
shears
most
successful
and
now
have
you
business
in
england
yes
a
few
accounts
to
settle
but
i
was
forgetting
m
he
knows
all
ah
my
dear
maître
what
did
i
tell
you
the
harm
done
now
beyond
repair
would
it
not
have
been
better
to
let
me
go
to
work
in
my
own
way
a
day
or
two
more
and
i
should
have
recovered
the
jewish
lamp
and
the
other
things
from
bresson
and
sent
them
back
to
the
and
those
two
good
people
would
have
gone
on
living
peacefully
together
instead
of
which
instead
of
which
snarled
shears
i
have
muddled
everything
up
and
brought
discord
into
a
family
which
you
were
protecting
well
yes
if
you
like
protecting
is
it
indispensable
that
one
should
always
steal
cheat
and
do
harm
so
you
do
good
also
when
i
have
time
besides
it
amuses
me
i
think
it
extremely
funny
that
in
the
present
adventure
i
should
be
the
good
genius
who
rescues
and
saves
and
you
the
wicked
genius
who
brings
despair
and
tears
certainly
the
home
is
broken
up
and
alice
demun
is
weeping
she
could
not
have
remained
ganimard
would
have
ended
by
discovering
her
and
through
her
they
would
have
worked
back
to
mme
quite
of
your
opinion
maître
but
whose
fault
was
it
two
men
passed
in
front
of
them
shears
said
to
lupin
in
a
voice
the
tone
of
which
seemed
a
little
altered
do
you
know
who
those
two
gentlemen
are
i
think
one
was
the
captain
of
the
boat
and
the
other
i
do
know
it
is
austin
gilett
and
austin
gilett
occupies
in
england
a
post
which
corresponds
with
that
of
your
m
dudouis
oh
what
luck
would
you
have
the
kindness
to
introduce
me
dudouis
is
a
great
friend
of
mine
and
i
should
like
to
be
able
to
say
as
much
of
austin
gilett
the
two
gentlemen
reappeared
and
suppose
i
were
to
take
you
at
your
word
m
lupin
said
shears
rising
he
had
seized
arsène
lupin
wrist
and
held
it
in
a
grip
of
steel
why
grip
me
so
hard
maître
i
am
quite
ready
to
go
with
you
he
allowed
himself
in
fact
to
be
dragged
along
without
the
least
resistance
the
two
gentlemen
were
walking
away
from
them
shears
increased
his
pace
his
nails
dug
into
lupin
very
flesh
come
along
come
along
he
said
under
his
breath
in
a
sort
of
fevered
haste
to
settle
everything
as
quickly
as
possible
come
along
quick
but
he
stopped
short
alice
demun
had
followed
them
what
are
you
doing
mademoiselle
you
need
not
trouble
to
come
it
was
lupin
who
replied
i
beg
you
to
observe
maître
that
mademoiselle
is
not
coming
of
her
own
free
will
i
am
holding
her
wrist
with
an
energy
similar
to
that
which
you
are
applying
to
mine
and
why
why
well
i
am
bent
upon
introducing
her
also
her
part
in
the
story
of
the
jewish
lamp
is
even
more
important
than
mine
as
an
accomplice
of
arsène
lupin
and
of
bresson
as
well
she
too
must
tell
the
adventure
of
the
baronne
which
is
sure
to
interest
the
police
immensely
and
in
this
way
you
will
have
pushed
your
kind
interference
to
its
last
limits
o
generous
shears
the
englishman
had
released
his
prisoner
wrist
lupin
let
go
of
mademoiselle
they
stood
for
a
few
seconds
without
moving
looking
at
one
another
then
shears
went
back
to
his
bench
and
sat
down
lupin
and
the
girl
resumed
their
places
a
long
silence
divided
them
then
lupin
said
you
see
maître
do
what
we
may
we
shall
never
be
in
the
same
camp
you
will
always
be
on
one
side
of
the
ditch
i
on
the
other
we
can
nod
shake
hands
exchange
a
word
or
two
but
the
ditch
is
always
there
you
will
always
be
holmlock
shears
detective
and
i
arsène
lupin
burglar
and
holmlock
shears
will
always
more
or
less
spontaneously
more
or
less
seasonably
obey
his
instinct
as
a
detective
which
is
to
hound
down
the
burglar
and
him
in
if
possible
and
arsène
lupin
will
always
be
consistent
with
his
burglar
soul
in
avoiding
the
grasp
of
the
detective
and
laughing
at
him
if
he
can
and
this
time
he
can
ha
ha
ha
he
burst
into
a
cunning
cruel
and
detestable
laugh
then
suddenly
becoming
serious
he
leaned
toward
the
girl
be
sure
mademoiselle
that
though
reduced
to
the
last
extremity
i
would
not
have
betrayed
you
arsène
lupin
never
betrays
especially
those
whom
he
likes
and
admires
and
you
must
permit
me
to
say
that
i
like
and
admire
the
dear
plucky
creature
that
you
are
he
took
a
from
his
pocketbook
tore
it
in
two
gave
to
the
girl
and
in
a
touched
and
respectful
voice
if
shears
does
not
succeed
in
his
steps
mademoiselle
pray
go
to
lady
strongborough
whose
address
you
can
easily
find
out
hand
her
this
and
say
memories
lady
strongborough
will
show
you
the
devotion
of
a
sister
thank
you
said
the
girl
i
will
go
to
her
and
now
maître
cried
lupin
in
the
satisfied
tone
of
a
man
who
has
done
his
duty
let
me
bid
you
good
night
the
mist
has
delayed
us
and
there
is
still
time
to
take
forty
winks
he
stretched
himself
at
full
length
and
crossed
his
hands
behind
his
head
the
sky
had
opened
before
the
moon
she
shed
her
radiant
brightness
around
the
stars
and
over
the
sea
it
floated
upon
the
water
and
space
in
which
the
last
mists
were
dissolving
seemed
to
belong
to
it
the
line
of
the
coast
stood
out
against
the
dark
horizon
passengers
came
up
on
deck
which
was
now
covered
with
people
austin
gilett
passed
in
the
company
of
two
men
whom
shears
recognized
as
members
of
the
english
on
his
bench
lupin
slept
