i
the
development
of
the
modern
house
i
know
of
nothing
more
significant
than
the
awakening
of
men
and
women
throughout
our
country
to
the
desire
to
improve
their
houses
call
it
what
you
will
awakening
development
american
renaissance
it
is
a
most
startling
and
promising
condition
of
affairs
it
is
no
longer
possible
even
to
people
of
only
faintly
æsthetic
tastes
to
buy
chairs
merely
to
sit
upon
or
a
clock
merely
that
it
should
tell
the
time
are
determined
to
have
their
houses
outside
and
in
correct
according
to
the
best
standards
what
do
we
mean
by
the
best
standards
certainly
not
those
of
the
useless
overcharged
house
of
the
average
american
millionaire
who
builds
and
furnishes
his
home
with
a
hopeless
disregard
of
tradition
we
must
accept
the
standards
that
the
artists
and
the
architects
accept
the
standards
that
have
come
to
us
from
those
exceedingly
rational
people
our
ancestors
our
ancestors
built
for
stability
and
use
and
so
their
simple
houses
were
excellent
examples
of
architecture
their
spacious
uncrowded
interiors
were
usually
beautiful
houses
and
furniture
fulfilled
their
uses
and
if
an
object
fulfils
its
mission
the
chances
are
that
it
is
beautiful
it
is
all
very
well
to
plan
our
ideal
house
or
apartment
our
individual
castle
in
spain
but
it
is
necessary
to
live
among
intolerable
furnishings
just
because
we
can
not
realize
our
castle
there
never
was
a
house
so
bad
that
it
could
be
made
over
into
something
worth
while
we
shall
all
be
very
much
happier
when
we
learn
to
transform
the
things
we
have
into
a
semblance
of
our
ideal
how
then
may
we
go
about
accomplishing
our
ideal
by
letting
it
go
by
forgetting
this
vaguely
pleasing
dream
this
evidence
of
our
smug
vanity
and
making
ourselves
ready
for
a
new
ideal
by
considering
the
body
of
material
from
which
it
is
good
sense
to
choose
when
we
have
a
house
to
decorate
by
studying
the
development
of
the
modern
house
its
romantic
tradition
and
architectural
history
by
taking
upon
ourselves
the
duty
of
lessons
of
sincerity
and
common
sense
and
suitability
by
learning
what
is
meant
by
color
and
form
and
line
harmony
and
contrast
and
proportion
when
we
are
on
familiar
terms
with
our
tools
and
feel
our
vague
ideas
clearing
into
definite
inspiration
then
we
are
ready
to
talk
about
ideals
we
are
fit
to
approach
the
full
art
of
we
take
it
for
granted
that
every
woman
is
interested
in
houses
that
she
either
has
a
house
in
course
of
construction
or
dreams
of
having
one
or
has
had
a
house
long
enough
wrong
to
wish
it
right
and
we
take
it
for
granted
that
this
american
home
is
always
the
woman
home
a
man
may
build
and
decorate
a
beautiful
house
but
it
remains
for
a
woman
to
make
a
home
of
it
for
him
it
is
the
personality
of
the
mistress
that
the
home
expresses
men
are
forever
guests
in
our
homes
no
matter
how
much
happiness
they
may
find
there
you
will
express
yourself
in
your
house
whether
you
want
to
or
not
so
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
a
long
preparatory
discipline
you
may
have
only
one
house
to
furnish
in
your
possibly
so
be
careful
and
go
warily
therefore
you
must
select
for
your
architect
a
man
who
is
too
determined
to
have
way
it
is
a
fearful
mistake
to
leave
the
entire
planning
of
your
home
to
a
man
whose
social
experience
may
be
limited
for
instance
for
he
can
impose
on
you
his
conception
of
your
tastes
with
a
damning
permanency
and
emphasis
i
once
heard
a
certain
boston
architect
say
that
he
taught
his
clients
to
be
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
could
you
know
all
he
could
do
is
to
set
the
front
door
so
that
it
would
reprove
them
if
they
were
who
does
not
know
for
instance
those
mistaken
people
whose
houses
represent
their
own
or
their
architects
hasty
visits
to
the
fine
old
of
the
loire
or
the
palaces
of
versailles
or
the
fine
old
houses
of
england
or
the
gracious
villas
of
italy
we
must
avoid
such
aspiring
architects
and
visualize
our
homes
not
as
so
many
specially
designated
rooms
and
convenient
closets
but
as
individual
expressions
of
ourselves
of
the
future
we
plan
of
our
dreams
for
our
children
the
ideal
house
is
the
house
that
has
been
long
planned
for
long
awaited
illustration
in
this
hall
simplicity
suitability
and
proportion
are
observed
fortunately
for
us
our
best
architects
are
so
very
good
that
we
are
better
than
safe
if
we
take
our
problems
to
them
these
men
associate
with
themselves
the
hundred
young
architects
who
are
eager
to
prove
themselves
on
small
houses
the
idea
that
it
is
economical
to
be
your
own
architect
and
trust
your
house
to
a
building
contractor
is
a
mistaken
and
most
expensive
one
the
surer
you
are
of
your
common
sense
and
professional
ability
the
surer
you
may
be
that
your
house
will
be
economically
efficient
he
will
not
only
plan
a
house
that
will
meet
the
needs
of
your
family
but
he
will
give
you
inspiration
for
its
interior
he
will
concern
himself
with
the
moldings
the
the
and
hinges
the
unconsidered
things
that
make
or
mar
your
house
select
for
your
architect
a
man
you
like
for
a
friend
perhaps
he
will
be
before
the
house
comes
true
if
you
are
both
sincere
if
you
both
purpose
to
have
the
best
thing
you
can
afford
the
house
will
express
the
genius
and
character
of
your
architect
and
the
personality
and
character
of
yourself
as
a
great
painting
suggests
both
painter
and
sitter
the
hard
won
triumph
of
a
house
means
many
compromises
but
the
ultimate
satisfaction
is
worth
everything
i
do
not
purpose
in
this
book
to
go
into
the
historic
traditions
of
architecture
and
decoration
there
are
so
many
excellent
books
it
were
absurd
to
review
them
but
i
do
wish
to
trace
briefly
the
development
of
the
modern
house
the
woman
house
to
show
you
that
all
that
is
intimate
and
charming
in
the
home
as
we
know
it
has
come
through
the
unmeasured
influence
of
women
man
conceived
the
great
house
with
its
parade
rooms
its
but
woman
found
eternal
parade
tiresome
and
planned
for
herself
little
retreats
rooms
small
enough
for
comfort
and
intimacy
in
short
man
made
the
house
woman
went
him
one
better
and
made
of
it
a
home
the
virtues
of
simplicity
and
reticence
in
form
first
came
into
being
as
nearly
as
we
can
tell
in
the
the
little
apartment
of
isabella
the
marchioness
of
mantua
away
back
in
the
marchioness
made
of
this
little
studio
her
personal
retreat
here
she
brought
many
of
the
treasures
of
the
italian
renaissance
really
simplicity
and
reticence
were
the
last
things
she
considered
but
the
point
is
that
they
were
considered
at
all
in
such
a
restless
passionate
age
later
in
she
established
the
a
suite
of
apartments
which
she
occupied
after
her
husband
death
so
you
see
the
idea
of
a
woman
planning
her
own
apartment
is
pretty
old
after
all
the
next
woman
who
took
a
stand
that
revealed
genuine
social
consciousness
was
that
woman
catherine
de
vivonne
marquise
de
rambouillet
she
seceded
from
court
because
the
court
was
swaggering
and
with
florid
at
its
head
and
with
this
recession
she
began
to
express
in
her
conduct
her
feeling
her
conversation
and
finally
in
her
house
her
awakened
consciousness
of
beauty
and
reserve
of
simplicity
and
suitability
this
was
the
early
seventeenth
century
mind
you
when
the
main
salons
of
the
french
houses
were
filled
with
such
institutions
as
rows
of
red
chairs
and
boxed
state
beds
she
undertook
first
of
all
to
have
a
light
and
gracefully
curving
stairway
leading
to
her
salon
instead
of
supplanting
it
she
grouped
her
rooms
with
a
lovely
diversity
of
size
and
purpose
whereas
before
they
had
been
vast
stately
halls
with
cubbies
hardby
for
sleeping
she
gave
the
bedroom
its
alcove
boudoir
and
even
its
bath
and
then
as
decorator
she
supplanted
the
old
feudal
yellow
and
red
with
her
famous
she
covered
blue
chairs
with
silver
bullion
she
fashioned
long
tenderly
colored
curtains
of
novel
shades
reticence
was
always
in
evidence
but
it
was
the
reticence
of
elegance
it
was
through
madame
de
rambouillet
that
the
armchair
received
its
final
distribution
of
yielding
parts
and
began
to
express
the
comfort
of
soft
padded
backward
slope
of
width
and
warmth
and
color
it
was
all
very
heavy
very
grave
very
angular
this
hôtel
rambouillet
but
it
was
devised
for
and
consecrated
to
conversation
considered
a
new
form
of
privilege
the
in
their
later
jargon
called
chairs
the
indispensables
of
conversation
i
have
been
at
some
length
to
give
a
picture
of
madame
de
hôtel
because
it
really
is
the
earliest
modern
house
there
where
the
society
that
frequented
it
was
analyzing
its
soul
in
dialogue
and
long
platonic
discussion
that
would
seem
stark
enough
to
us
the
word
which
it
invented
for
itself
was
the
coinage
of
one
of
its
own
foremost
figures
it
is
unprofitable
to
follow
on
into
the
grandeurs
of
louis
xiv
if
one
hopes
to
find
an
advance
there
in
architecture
at
the
end
of
that
splendid
official
success
the
squalor
of
versailles
was
unspeakable
its
stenches
unbearable
in
spite
of
its
size
the
palace
was
known
as
the
most
comfortless
house
in
europe
after
the
death
of
its
owner
society
in
a
fit
of
madness
plunged
into
the
when
the
restlessness
of
louis
xv
could
no
longer
find
moorings
in
this
brilliancy
there
came
into
being
little
houses
called
garden
hermitages
for
the
privileged
here
we
find
madame
de
pompadour
in
calicoes
in
a
wild
garden
playing
as
a
milkmaid
or
seated
in
a
little
interior
with
painted
wooden
furniture
having
her
supper
on
an
service
that
has
replaced
old
silver
and
gold
amorous
alcoves
lost
their
painted
loves
and
took
on
gray
and
white
decorations
the
casinos
of
little
did
not
glitter
any
more
english
sentiment
began
to
bedim
gallic
eyes
and
so
what
we
know
as
the
louis
xvi
style
was
born
and
so
at
that
moment
the
idea
of
the
modern
house
came
into
its
own
and
it
could
advance
as
an
idea
hardly
any
further
for
with
all
the
intrepidity
and
passion
of
the
later
eighteenth
century
in
its
search
for
beauty
for
all
the
of
convenience
and
ingenuity
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
fundamentals
have
changed
but
little
and
now
we
of
the
twentieth
century
can
only
add
material
comforts
and
an
expression
of
our
personality
we
raise
the
house
beyond
the
reach
of
squalor
we
give
it
measured
heat
we
give
it
water
in
abundance
and
perfect
sanitation
and
light
everywhere
we
give
it
ventilation
less
successfully
than
we
might
and
finally
we
give
it
the
human
quality
that
is
so
modern
there
are
no
dungeons
in
the
good
modern
house
no
disgraceful
lairs
for
servants
no
horrors
of
humidity
illustration
mennoyer
drawings
and
old
mirrors
set
in
panelings
and
so
we
women
have
achieved
a
house
luminous
with
kind
purpose
throughout
it
is
finished
that
is
our
difficulty
we
inherit
it
all
rounded
in
its
perfection
consummate
in
its
charms
but
it
is
finished
and
what
can
we
do
about
a
thing
that
is
finished
i
does
it
seem
that
we
are
back
in
the
old
position
of
isabella
eager
predatory
and
thingy
and
is
it
time
for
us
to
pull
up
short
lest
we
sidestep
the
goal
we
are
so
sure
of
a
thousand
appetites
we
are
in
danger
of
passing
by
the
amiable
commonplaces
we
find
ourselves
dismayed
in
old
houses
that
look
too
simple
we
must
stop
and
ask
ourselves
questions
and
if
necessary
plan
for
ourselves
little
retreats
until
we
can
find
ourselves
again
what
is
the
goal
a
house
that
is
like
the
life
that
goes
on
within
it
a
house
that
gives
us
beauty
as
we
understand
it
and
beauty
of
a
nobler
kind
that
we
may
grow
to
understand
a
house
that
amenity
suppose
you
have
obtained
this
sort
of
wisdom
a
sane
viewpoint
i
think
it
will
give
you
as
great
a
satisfaction
to
your
house
with
what
you
have
as
to
the
results
may
not
be
so
charming
but
you
can
learn
by
them
you
can
take
your
indiscriminate
inheritance
of
victorian
rosewood
of
eastlake
walnut
and
cocobolo
your
colored
morris
furniture
and
make
a
civilized
interior
by
placing
it
right
and
putting
detail
at
the
right
points
your
sense
of
the
pleasure
and
meaning
of
human
intercourse
will
be
clear
in
your
disposition
of
your
best
things
in
your
elimination
of
your
worst
ones
when
you
have
emptied
the
tables
of
so
that
you
can
put
down
on
them
at
need
placed
them
in
a
light
where
you
can
write
on
them
in
repose
or
isolated
real
works
of
art
in
the
middle
of
them
when
you
have
set
your
dropsical
sofas
where
you
want
them
for
talk
or
warmth
and
reading
when
you
can
see
the
fire
from
the
bed
in
your
and
dress
near
your
bath
if
this
sort
of
sense
of
your
rights
is
acknowledged
in
your
rearrangement
your
rooms
will
always
have
meaning
in
the
end
if
you
like
only
the
things
in
a
chair
that
have
meaning
and
grow
to
hate
the
rest
you
will
without
any
other
instruction
prefer
the
next
time
you
are
buying
a
good
louis
xvi
to
a
stuffed
velvet
chair
you
will
never
again
be
guilty
of
the
errors
of
meaningless
magnificence
to
most
of
us
in
america
who
must
perforce
lead
workaday
lives
the
absence
of
beauty
is
a
very
distinct
lack
i
think
indeed
that
the
present
awakening
has
come
to
stay
and
that
before
very
long
we
shall
have
simple
houses
with
fireplaces
that
draw
electric
lights
in
the
proper
places
comfortable
and
sensible
furniture
and
not
a
table
or
chair
anywhere
this
may
be
a
optimistic
dream
but
let
us
all
hope
that
it
may
come
true
ii
suitability
simplicity
and
proportion
when
i
am
asked
to
decorate
a
new
house
my
first
thought
is
suitability
my
next
thought
is
proportion
always
i
keep
in
mind
the
importance
of
simplicity
first
i
study
the
people
who
are
to
live
in
this
house
and
their
needs
as
thoroughly
as
i
studied
my
parts
in
the
days
when
i
was
an
actress
for
the
i
really
am
the
chatelaine
of
the
house
when
i
have
thoroughly
familiarized
myself
with
my
part
i
let
that
go
for
the
time
and
consider
the
proportion
of
the
house
and
its
rooms
it
is
much
more
important
that
the
wall
openings
windows
doors
and
fireplaces
should
be
in
the
right
place
and
should
balance
one
another
than
that
there
should
be
expensive
and
extravagant
hangings
and
carpets
my
first
thought
in
laying
out
a
room
is
the
placing
of
the
electric
light
openings
how
rarely
does
one
find
the
lights
in
the
right
place
in
our
hotels
and
residences
one
arrives
from
a
journey
tired
out
and
only
to
find
oneself
facing
a
mirror
as
far
removed
from
the
daylight
as
possible
with
the
artificial
lights
directly
behind
one
or
high
in
the
ceiling
in
the
center
of
the
room
in
my
houses
i
always
see
that
each
room
shall
have
its
lights
placed
for
the
comfort
of
its
occupants
there
must
be
lights
in
sheltered
corners
of
the
fireplace
by
the
on
each
side
of
the
and
so
on
then
i
consider
the
heating
of
the
room
we
americans
are
slaves
to
steam
heat
we
ruin
our
furniture
our
complexions
and
our
dispositions
by
this
enervating
atmosphere
of
too
much
heat
in
my
own
houses
i
have
a
fireplace
in
each
room
and
i
burn
wood
in
it
there
is
a
in
the
basement
of
my
house
but
it
is
under
perfect
control
i
prefer
the
normal
heat
of
sunshine
and
open
fires
but
granted
that
open
fires
are
impossible
in
all
your
rooms
do
arrange
in
the
beginning
that
the
small
rooms
of
your
house
may
not
be
overheated
it
is
a
distinct
irritation
to
a
person
who
loves
clean
air
to
go
into
a
room
where
a
flood
of
steam
heat
pours
out
of
every
corner
there
is
usually
no
way
to
control
it
unless
you
turn
it
off
altogether
i
once
had
the
temerity
to
do
this
in
a
certain
hotel
room
where
there
was
a
cold
and
cheerless
empty
fireplace
i
summoned
a
reluctant
chambermaid
only
to
be
told
that
the
chimney
had
never
had
a
fire
in
it
and
the
proprietor
would
rather
not
take
such
a
risk
illustration
a
portrait
by
nattier
inset
above
a
fine
old
mantel
perhaps
the
guest
in
your
house
would
not
be
so
troublesome
but
tempt
her
if
you
have
a
fireplace
see
that
it
is
in
working
order
we
are
sure
to
judge
a
woman
in
whose
house
we
find
ourselves
for
the
first
time
by
her
surroundings
we
judge
her
temperament
her
habits
her
inclinations
by
the
interior
of
her
home
we
may
talk
of
the
weather
but
we
are
looking
at
the
furniture
we
attribute
vulgar
qualities
to
those
who
are
content
to
live
in
ugly
surroundings
we
endow
with
refinement
and
charm
the
person
who
welcomes
us
in
a
delightful
room
where
the
colors
blend
and
the
proportions
are
as
perfect
as
in
a
picture
after
all
what
surer
guarantee
can
there
be
of
a
woman
character
natural
and
cultivated
inherent
and
inherited
than
taste
it
is
a
compass
that
never
errs
if
a
woman
has
taste
she
may
have
faults
follies
fads
she
may
err
she
may
be
as
human
and
feminine
as
she
pleases
but
she
will
never
cause
a
scandal
how
can
we
develop
taste
some
of
us
alas
can
never
develop
it
because
we
can
never
let
go
of
shams
we
must
learn
to
recognize
suitability
simplicity
and
proportion
and
apply
our
knowledge
to
our
needs
i
grant
you
we
may
never
fully
appreciate
the
full
balance
of
proportion
but
we
can
exert
our
common
sense
and
decide
whether
a
thing
is
suitable
we
can
consult
our
conscience
as
to
whether
an
object
is
simple
and
we
can
train
our
eyes
to
recognize
good
and
bad
proportion
a
technical
knowledge
of
architecture
is
not
necessary
to
know
that
a
huge
stuffed
leather
chair
in
a
tiny
gold
and
cream
room
is
unsuitable
is
hideously
complicated
and
is
as
much
out
of
proportion
as
the
proverbial
bull
in
the
a
woman
environment
will
speak
for
her
life
whether
she
likes
it
or
not
how
can
we
believe
that
a
woman
of
sincerity
of
purpose
will
hang
fake
works
of
art
on
her
walls
or
satisfy
herself
with
imitation
velvets
or
silks
how
can
we
attribute
taste
to
a
woman
who
permits
paper
floors
and
iron
ceilings
in
her
house
we
are
too
afraid
of
the
restful
commonplaces
and
yet
if
we
live
simple
lives
why
should
we
be
glad
our
houses
are
comfortably
commonplace
how
much
better
to
have
plain
furniture
that
is
comfortable
simple
chintzes
printed
from
old
blocks
a
few
good
prints
than
all
the
sham
things
in
the
world
a
house
is
a
anyhow
so
you
should
arrange
is
so
that
the
person
who
sees
your
personality
in
it
will
be
reassured
not
disconcerted
too
often
here
in
america
the
most
comfortable
room
in
the
house
is
given
up
to
a
sort
of
bastard
collection
of
gilt
chairs
and
tables
draperies
shutting
out
both
light
and
air
and
huge
and
frightful
paintings
this
style
of
room
with
its
furnishings
has
been
dubbed
marie
antoinette
no
one
but
the
american
decorator
can
say
heaven
knows
poor
marie
antoinette
had
enough
follies
to
atone
for
but
certainly
she
has
never
been
treated
more
shabbily
than
when
they
dub
these
mausoleums
marie
antoinette
rooms
i
remember
taking
a
clever
englishwoman
of
much
taste
to
see
a
woman
who
was
very
proud
of
her
new
house
we
had
seen
most
of
the
house
when
the
hostess
who
had
evidently
reserved
what
she
considered
the
best
for
the
last
threw
open
the
doors
of
a
large
and
gorgeous
apartment
and
said
this
is
my
louis
xvi
ballroom
my
friend
who
had
been
very
patient
up
to
that
moment
said
very
quietly
what
makes
you
think
so
louis
xvi
thought
a
salon
well
furnished
with
a
few
fine
chairs
and
a
table
he
wished
to
be
of
supreme
importance
in
the
immense
salons
of
the
italian
palaces
there
were
a
few
benches
and
chairs
people
then
wished
spaces
about
them
nowadays
people
are
swamped
by
their
furniture
too
many
centuries
too
many
races
crowd
one
another
in
a
small
room
the
owner
seems
insignificant
among
his
collections
of
historical
furniture
whether
he
collects
all
sorts
of
things
of
all
periods
in
one
heterogeneous
mass
or
whether
he
fills
his
house
with
the
furniture
of
some
one
epoch
he
is
not
at
home
in
his
surroundings
the
furniture
of
every
epoch
records
its
history
our
ancestors
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
inherited
the
troublous
times
of
their
fathers
in
their
heavy
oaken
chests
they
owned
more
chests
than
anything
else
because
a
chest
could
be
carried
away
on
the
back
of
a
sturdy
pack
mule
when
the
necessity
arose
for
flight
people
never
had
time
to
sit
down
in
the
sixteenth
century
their
feverish
unrest
is
recorded
in
their
stiff
backed
chairs
it
was
not
until
the
seventeenth
century
that
they
had
time
to
sit
down
and
talk
we
need
no
book
of
history
to
teach
us
this
we
have
only
to
observe
the
ample
proportions
of
the
of
the
period
our
ancestors
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
worked
with
a
faith
in
the
permanence
of
what
they
created
we
have
lost
this
happy
confidence
we
are
occupied
exclusively
with
preserving
and
reproducing
we
have
not
succeeded
in
creating
a
style
adapted
to
our
modern
life
it
is
just
as
well
our
life
with
its
haste
its
nervousness
and
its
preoccupations
does
not
inspire
the
we
can
not
do
better
than
to
accept
the
standards
of
other
times
and
adapt
them
to
our
uses
why
should
we
american
woman
run
after
styles
and
periods
of
which
we
know
nothing
why
should
we
not
be
content
with
the
fundamental
things
the
formal
french
room
is
very
delightful
in
the
proper
place
but
when
it
is
unsuited
to
the
people
who
must
live
in
it
it
is
as
bad
as
a
sham
room
the
woman
who
wears
paste
jewels
is
not
so
conspicuously
wrong
as
the
woman
who
plasters
herself
with
too
many
real
jewels
at
the
wrong
time
this
is
what
i
am
always
fighting
in
people
houses
the
unsuitability
of
things
the
foolish
woman
goes
about
from
shop
to
shop
and
buys
as
her
fancy
directs
she
sees
something
pretty
and
buys
it
though
it
has
no
reference
either
in
form
or
color
to
the
scheme
of
her
house
have
you
been
in
rooms
where
there
was
a
jumble
of
mission
furniture
satinwood
fine
old
mahogany
and
chairs
and
it
is
the
same
with
color
a
woman
says
oh
i
love
blue
let
have
blue
regardless
of
the
exposure
of
her
room
and
the
furnishings
she
has
already
collected
and
then
when
she
has
treated
each
one
of
her
rooms
in
a
different
color
and
with
a
different
floor
covering
she
wonders
why
she
is
always
fretted
in
going
from
one
room
to
another
do
go
about
the
furnishing
of
your
house
with
the
idea
that
you
must
select
the
furniture
of
some
one
period
and
stick
to
that
it
is
at
all
necessary
there
are
old
english
chairs
and
tables
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
that
fit
into
our
quiet
spacious
twentieth
century
country
homes
lines
and
fabrics
and
woods
are
the
things
to
be
compared
there
are
so
many
beautiful
things
that
have
come
to
us
from
other
times
that
it
should
be
easy
to
make
our
homes
beautiful
but
i
have
seen
what
i
can
best
describe
as
apoplectic
chairs
whose
legs
were
fashioned
like
aquatic
plants
tables
upheld
by
tortured
naked
women
lighting
fixtures
in
the
form
of
tassels
and
such
horrors
in
many
houses
of
under
the
guise
of
being
authentic
period
furniture
only
a
connoisseur
can
ever
hope
to
know
about
the
furniture
of
every
period
but
all
of
us
can
easily
learn
the
of
the
furniture
that
is
suited
to
our
homes
i
sha
talk
about
here
however
because
dozens
of
collectors
have
compiled
excellent
books
that
tell
you
all
about
curves
and
lines
and
and
my
business
is
to
persuade
you
to
use
your
graceful
french
sofas
and
your
simple
rush
bottom
new
england
chairs
in
different
rooms
in
other
words
to
preach
to
you
the
beauty
of
suitability
suitability
suitability
it
is
such
a
relief
to
return
to
the
tranquil
simple
forms
of
furniture
and
to
decorate
our
rooms
by
a
process
of
elimination
how
many
rooms
have
i
not
cleared
of
junk
this
heterogeneous
mass
of
ornamental
period
furniture
and
bought
to
make
a
room
look
cozy
once
cleared
of
these
the
simplicity
and
dignity
of
the
room
comes
back
the
architectural
spaces
are
freed
and
now
stand
in
their
proper
relation
to
the
furniture
in
other
words
the
architecture
of
the
room
becomes
its
decoration
iii
the
old
washington
irving
house
i
have
always
lived
in
enchanting
houses
probably
when
another
woman
would
be
dreaming
of
love
affairs
i
dream
of
the
delightful
houses
i
have
lived
in
and
just
as
the
woman
who
dreams
of
many
lovers
finds
one
dream
a
little
dearer
than
all
the
rest
so
one
of
my
houses
has
been
dearer
to
me
than
all
the
others
illustration
the
washington
irving
house
was
delightfully
rambling
this
favorite
love
of
mine
is
the
old
washington
irving
house
in
new
york
the
quaint
mansion
that
gave
historic
irving
place
its
name
for
twenty
years
my
friend
elizabeth
marbury
and
i
made
this
old
house
our
home
two
years
ago
we
reluctantly
gave
up
the
old
house
and
moved
into
a
more
modern
one
also
transformed
from
old
into
new
on
east
street
we
have
also
a
delightful
old
house
in
france
the
villa
trianon
at
versailles
where
we
spend
our
summers
so
you
see
we
have
had
the
rare
experience
of
transforming
three
mistreated
old
houses
into
very
delightful
homes
when
we
found
this
old
house
so
many
years
ago
we
were
very
young
and
it
is
amusing
now
to
think
of
its
evolution
we
had
so
many
dreams
so
many
theories
and
we
tried
them
all
out
on
the
old
house
and
like
a
patient
maiden
aunt
the
old
house
always
accepted
our
changes
most
placidly
there
never
was
such
a
house
you
could
do
anything
to
it
because
fundamentally
it
was
good
its
wall
spaces
were
inviting
its
windows
were
made
for
framing
pleasant
things
when
we
moved
there
we
had
a
broad
sweep
of
view
i
can
remember
seeing
the
river
from
our
now
the
city
has
grown
up
around
the
old
house
and
jostled
it
rudely
and
shut
out
much
of
its
sunshine
there
is
a
joy
in
the
opportunity
of
creating
a
beautiful
interior
for
a
new
and
house
but
best
of
all
is
the
joy
of
furnishing
an
old
house
like
this
one
it
is
like
reviving
an
old
garden
it
may
not
be
just
your
idea
of
a
garden
to
begin
with
but
as
you
study
it
and
deck
its
barren
spaces
with
masses
of
color
and
fit
a
sundial
into
the
spot
that
so
needs
it
and
give
the
sunshine
a
fountain
to
play
with
you
love
the
old
garden
just
a
little
more
every
time
you
touch
it
until
it
becomes
to
you
the
most
beautiful
garden
in
all
the
world
gardens
and
houses
are
such
whimsical
things
this
old
house
of
ours
had
been
so
long
mistreated
that
it
was
fairly
petulant
and
querulous
when
i
began
studying
it
it
asked
questions
on
every
turn
and
seemed
surprised
when
they
were
answered
the
house
was
delightfully
rambling
with
a
tiny
entrance
hall
and
narrow
stairs
and
sudden
up
and
down
steps
from
one
room
to
another
like
the
old
old
house
one
associates
with
places
and
old
times
the
little
entrance
hall
was
worse
than
a
question
it
was
a
problem
but
i
finally
solved
it
the
floor
was
paved
with
little
tiles
of
a
wonderful
old
red
a
door
made
of
little
square
panes
of
mirrors
was
placed
where
it
would
deceive
the
old
hall
into
thinking
itself
a
spacious
thing
the
walls
were
covered
with
a
that
looked
as
old
as
rip
van
winkle
this
is
the
same
paper
that
i
afterward
used
in
the
colony
club
hallway
the
woodwork
was
painted
a
soft
finally
i
had
my
collection
of
faded
french
costume
prints
set
flat
against
the
top
of
the
wall
as
a
frieze
the
hall
was
so
very
narrow
that
as
you
went
up
stairs
you
could
actually
examine
the
old
prints
in
detail
another
little
thing
i
covered
the
handrail
of
the
stairs
with
a
soft
velvet
of
the
same
tone
as
the
woodwork
and
the
effect
was
so
very
good
and
the
touch
of
it
so
very
nice
that
many
of
my
friends
straightway
adopted
the
idea
but
i
am
placing
the
cart
before
the
horse
i
should
talk
of
the
shell
of
the
house
before
the
contents
should
i
it
is
hard
to
talk
of
this
particular
house
as
a
thing
apart
from
its
furnishings
however
for
every
bit
of
paneling
every
the
placing
of
each
mirror
was
worked
out
so
that
the
shell
of
the
house
and
its
furnishings
might
be
in
perfect
harmony
the
and
occupied
the
first
floor
of
the
house
the
was
a
long
narrow
room
with
cream
woodwork
and
walls
the
walls
were
broken
into
panels
by
the
use
of
a
narrow
molding
in
the
large
panel
above
the
i
had
inset
a
painting
by
nattier
you
will
see
the
same
painting
used
in
the
street
house
in
another
illustration
the
color
scheme
of
rose
and
cream
and
dull
yellow
was
worked
out
from
the
rose
and
yellow
persian
rug
most
of
the
furniture
we
found
in
france
but
it
fitted
perfectly
into
this
aristocratic
and
dignified
room
miss
marbury
and
i
have
a
perfect
right
to
french
things
in
our
you
see
for
we
are
french
residents
for
half
the
year
and
besides
this
gracious
old
house
welcomed
a
fine
old
louis
xiv
sofa
as
serenely
as
you
please
i
have
no
idea
of
swallowing
my
words
about
unsuitability
light
air
and
comfort
these
three
things
i
must
always
have
in
a
room
whether
it
be
or
servant
room
this
room
had
all
three
the
chairs
were
all
comfortable
the
lights
well
placed
and
there
was
plenty
of
sunshine
and
air
the
color
of
the
room
was
so
subdued
that
it
was
restful
to
the
eye
one
color
faded
into
another
so
subtly
that
one
did
not
realize
there
was
a
definite
the
hangings
of
the
room
were
of
a
deep
rose
color
i
used
the
same
colors
in
the
coverings
of
the
chairs
and
sofas
the
house
was
curtained
throughout
with
fine
white
muslin
curtains
no
matter
what
the
inner
curtains
of
a
room
may
be
i
use
this
simple
stuff
against
the
window
itself
there
is
any
nicer
material
to
me
there
is
something
unsuitable
in
an
array
of
lace
against
a
window
like
underclothes
hung
up
to
dry
illustration
a
washington
irving
house
bedroom
the
most
delightful
part
of
the
was
the
little
conservatory
which
was
a
plain
lamentable
once
upon
a
time
i
determined
to
make
a
little
of
it
and
had
the
floor
of
it
paved
with
large
tiles
and
between
the
hardwood
floor
of
the
and
the
marble
of
the
window
space
was
a
narrow
curb
of
marble
which
made
it
possible
to
have
a
jolly
little
fountain
in
the
window
the
fountain
splashed
away
to
its
heart
content
for
there
was
a
drain
pipe
under
the
curb
at
the
top
of
the
windows
there
were
shallow
white
boxes
filled
with
trailing
ivy
that
hung
down
and
screened
the
glass
making
the
window
as
delightful
to
the
without
as
to
us
within
there
were
several
pots
of
flowers
standing
in
a
prim
row
on
the
marble
curb
you
see
how
much
simpler
it
is
to
make
the
best
of
an
old
bay
window
than
to
build
on
a
new
conservatory
there
are
thousands
of
houses
with
windows
like
this
one
of
ours
an
unfortunate
space
of
which
no
use
is
made
sometimes
there
is
a
gilt
table
bearing
a
lofty
jar
sometimes
a
timid
effort
at
comfort
a
sofa
but
usually
the
bay
window
is
sacred
to
its
own
devices
whatever
they
may
be
why
not
spend
a
few
dollars
and
make
it
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
room
by
giving
it
a
lot
of
vines
and
flowers
and
a
small
fountain
it
is
at
all
an
expensive
thing
to
do
from
the
you
entered
the
this
was
a
long
room
with
beautifully
spaced
walls
a
high
ceiling
and
quaint
cupboards
the
arrangement
of
the
mirrors
around
the
cupboards
and
doors
was
unusual
and
most
decorative
this
room
was
so
beautiful
in
itself
that
i
used
very
little
color
but
color
we
never
tired
of
the
gray
and
white
and
ivory
the
quiet
atmosphere
that
made
glorious
the
old
chinese
carpet
with
its
ground
and
medallions
and
border
the
large
sketches
set
in
the
walls
are
originals
by
mennoyer
the
delightful
eighteenth
century
artist
who
did
the
overdoors
of
the
petit
trianon
the
lighting
fixtures
i
brought
over
from
france
the
too
was
french
of
a
creamy
wood
the
chairs
had
insets
of
cane
of
a
deeper
tone
the
recessed
was
covered
with
a
soft
velvet
of
a
deep
yellow
and
there
were
as
many
little
footstools
beside
the
as
there
were
chairs
in
the
room
does
everyone
long
for
a
footstool
at
table
i
believe
that
everything
in
one
house
should
be
comfortable
but
one
bedroom
must
be
more
than
comfortable
it
must
be
intimate
personal
one
secret
garden
so
to
speak
it
may
be
as
simple
as
a
convent
cell
and
still
have
this
quality
of
the
personality
of
its
occupant
there
are
two
things
that
are
as
important
to
me
as
the
bed
in
the
bedrooms
that
i
furnish
and
they
are
the
little
tables
at
the
head
of
the
bed
and
the
lounging
chairs
the
little
table
must
hold
a
good
reading
light
well
shaded
for
who
does
like
to
read
in
bed
there
must
also
be
a
clock
and
there
really
should
be
a
telephone
and
the
or
couch
as
the
case
may
be
should
be
both
comfortable
and
beautiful
who
has
longed
for
a
comfortable
place
to
snatch
forty
winks
at
midday
my
own
bedroom
in
this
house
was
very
pleasant
to
me
the
house
was
very
small
you
see
and
my
bedroom
had
to
be
my
too
so
that
accounts
for
the
bookshelves
that
fill
the
wall
space
above
and
around
the
mantel
and
the
large
the
room
was
built
around
a
wonderful
old
french
bed
which
came
from
brittany
this
old
bed
is
of
carved
mahogany
with
mirrored
panels
on
the
side
against
the
wall
and
with
tall
columns
at
the
ends
it
is
always
hung
with
embroidered
silk
in
the
rose
color
that
i
adore
and
has
any
number
of
pillows
big
and
little
the
was
covered
with
this
same
silk
as
were
the
various
chair
cushions
the
other
furnishings
were
in
keeping
it
was
a
delightfully
comfortable
room
and
it
grew
a
little
at
a
time
i
needed
bookshelves
and
i
built
them
a
was
necessary
and
i
found
the
old
brass
lantern
which
hung
from
the
ceiling
and
so
it
was
furnished
bit
by
bit
need
by
need
miss
marbury
bedroom
in
this
house
was
entirely
different
in
type
but
exactly
the
same
in
comfort
the
furniture
was
of
white
enamel
the
walls
and
the
rug
a
soft
dull
blue
the
chintz
used
was
the
familiar
bird
of
paradise
gorgeous
in
design
but
so
subdued
in
tone
that
one
never
tires
of
it
the
bed
had
a
flat
perfectly
fitted
cover
of
the
chintz
which
is
tucked
under
the
mattress
the
box
spring
was
also
covered
with
the
chintz
and
the
effect
was
always
tidy
and
satisfactory
this
is
the
neatest
disposal
of
the
i
have
seen
i
always
advise
this
arrangement
besides
the
bed
there
was
the
necessary
little
table
holding
a
and
so
forth
and
at
the
head
of
the
bed
a
most
adorable
screen
of
white
enamel
paneled
with
chintz
below
and
glass
above
there
was
a
soft
couch
of
generous
width
in
this
room
with
covers
and
cushions
of
the
chintz
over
near
the
windows
was
the
with
the
properly
placed
this
table
hung
with
chintz
had
a
sheet
of
plate
glass
exactly
fitting
its
top
the
near
the
window
is
also
part
of
my
creed
of
comfort
there
should
be
a
in
every
bedroom
my
friends
laugh
at
the
little
fat
pincushions
on
my
but
when
they
are
covered
with
a
bit
of
the
chintz
or
tapestry
or
brocade
of
the
room
they
are
very
pretty
and
i
am
sure
pins
are
as
necessary
on
the
as
on
the
illustration
miss
marbury
bedroom
another
thing
i
like
on
every
is
a
clear
glass
bowl
of
dried
rose
petals
which
gives
the
room
the
faintest
spicy
fragrance
there
is
also
a
little
bowl
of
just
the
proper
color
to
hold
pens
and
clips
and
odds
and
ends
i
get
as
much
pleasure
from
planning
these
small
details
as
from
the
planning
of
the
larger
furniture
of
the
room
the
house
was
very
simple
you
see
and
very
small
and
so
when
the
time
came
to
leave
it
we
had
grown
to
love
every
inch
of
it
you
can
love
a
small
house
so
completely
but
we
could
forgive
the
skyscrapers
encroaching
on
our
supply
of
sunshine
and
we
really
needed
more
room
and
so
we
said
to
our
beloved
old
house
and
moved
into
a
new
one
now
we
find
ourselves
in
danger
of
loving
the
new
one
as
much
as
the
old
but
that
is
another
story
iv
the
little
house
of
many
mirrors
one
walks
the
streets
of
new
york
and
receives
the
fantastic
impression
that
some
giant
architect
has
made
for
the
city
thousands
of
houses
in
replica
these
dismal
brownstone
buildings
are
so
like
without
and
alas
so
like
within
that
one
wonders
how
their
owners
know
their
homes
from
one
another
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
making
over
many
of
these
gloomy
barracks
into
homes
for
other
people
and
when
we
left
the
old
irving
place
house
we
took
one
of
these
dreary
houses
for
ourselves
and
made
it
over
into
a
semblance
of
what
a
city
house
should
be
you
know
the
kind
of
house
there
are
tens
of
thousands
of
them
a
four
story
and
basement
house
of
pinkish
brownstone
with
a
long
flight
of
ugly
stairs
from
the
street
to
the
first
floor
the
common
belief
that
all
city
houses
of
this
type
must
be
dark
and
dreary
just
because
they
always
been
dark
and
dreary
is
an
unnecessary
superstition
my
object
in
taking
this
house
was
twofold
i
wanted
to
prove
to
my
friends
that
it
was
possible
to
take
one
of
the
darkest
and
grimiest
of
city
houses
and
make
it
an
abode
of
sunshine
and
light
and
i
wanted
to
furnish
the
whole
house
exactly
as
i
pleased
for
once
the
remaking
of
the
house
was
very
interesting
i
tore
away
the
ugly
stone
steps
and
centered
the
entrance
door
in
a
little
on
the
level
of
the
old
the
is
just
a
step
below
the
street
level
giving
you
a
pleasant
feeling
of
invitation
everyone
hates
to
climb
into
a
house
but
there
is
a
subtle
allure
in
a
garden
or
a
court
yard
or
a
room
into
which
you
must
step
down
the
is
enclosed
with
a
high
iron
railing
banked
with
formal
above
the
huge
green
entrance
door
there
is
a
graceful
iron
balcony
filled
with
green
things
that
pulls
the
great
door
and
the
central
window
of
the
floor
above
into
an
impressive
composition
the
façade
of
the
house
instead
of
being
a
commonplace
rectangle
of
stone
broken
by
windows
has
this
long
connected
break
of
the
door
and
balcony
and
window
by
such
simple
devices
are
happy
results
accomplished
the
door
itself
is
noteworthy
with
its
great
bronze
knob
set
squarely
in
the
center
on
each
side
of
it
there
are
the
low
windows
of
the
entrance
hall
with
of
evergreens
compare
this
orderly
arrangement
of
windows
and
entrance
door
with
the
badly
balanced
houses
of
the
old
type
and
you
will
realize
anew
the
value
of
balance
and
proportion
from
the
you
enter
the
hall
once
within
the
hall
the
house
widens
magically
surely
this
cool
black
and
white
apartment
can
not
be
a
part
of
restless
new
york
have
you
ever
come
suddenly
upon
an
old
southern
house
and
thrilled
at
the
classic
purity
of
white
columns
in
a
forest
this
entrance
hall
gives
you
the
same
thrill
the
elements
of
formality
of
tranquillity
of
coolness
are
so
evident
the
walls
and
ceiling
are
a
deep
flat
cream
and
the
floor
is
laid
in
large
black
and
white
marble
tiles
exactly
opposite
you
as
you
enter
there
is
a
wall
fountain
with
a
background
of
mirrors
the
water
spills
over
from
the
fountain
into
ferns
and
flowers
banked
within
a
marble
curb
the
two
wall
spaces
on
your
right
and
left
are
broken
by
graceful
niches
which
hold
old
statues
an
oval
chinese
rug
and
the
white
and
orange
flowers
of
the
fountain
furnish
the
necessary
color
the
windows
flanking
the
entrance
doorway
are
hung
with
flat
curtains
of
coarse
white
linen
with
inserts
of
old
filet
lace
and
there
are
side
curtains
of
dead
black
silk
with
borderings
of
silver
and
gold
threads
in
any
house
that
i
have
anything
to
do
with
there
is
some
sort
of
desk
or
table
for
writing
in
the
hall
how
often
i
have
been
in
other
people
houses
when
it
was
necessary
to
send
a
message
or
to
record
an
address
when
the
whole
household
began
scurrying
around
trying
to
find
a
pencil
and
paper
this
to
my
mind
is
an
outward
and
visible
sign
of
an
inward
and
fundamental
lack
of
order
illustration
the
forecourt
and
entrance
of
the
street
house
in
this
hall
there
is
a
charming
desk
particularly
adapted
to
its
place
it
is
a
standing
desk
which
can
be
lowered
or
heightened
at
will
so
that
one
who
wishes
to
scribble
a
line
or
so
may
use
it
without
sitting
down
this
desk
is
called
a
i
found
it
in
biarritz
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
have
one
made
by
a
good
for
the
lines
and
method
of
construction
are
simple
my
hall
desk
is
so
placed
that
it
is
lighted
by
the
window
by
day
and
the
wall
lights
by
night
but
it
might
be
lighted
by
two
tall
candlesticks
if
a
wall
light
were
not
available
there
is
a
shallow
drawer
which
contains
surplus
writing
materials
but
the
only
things
permitted
on
the
writing
surface
of
the
desk
are
the
tray
for
cards
the
pad
and
pencils
the
only
other
furniture
in
the
hall
is
an
old
porter
chair
near
the
door
a
chair
that
suggests
the
sedan
of
old
france
but
serves
its
purpose
admirably
a
glass
door
leads
to
the
inner
hall
and
the
stairway
which
i
consider
the
best
thing
in
the
house
instead
of
the
usual
steep
and
gloomy
stairs
with
which
we
are
all
familiar
here
is
a
graceful
spiral
stairway
which
runs
from
this
floor
to
the
roof
the
stair
hall
has
two
walls
made
up
of
mirrors
in
the
french
fashion
that
is
cut
in
squares
and
held
in
place
by
small
rosettes
of
gilt
and
these
mirrored
walls
seemingly
double
the
spaciousness
of
what
would
be
under
ordinary
conditions
a
gloomy
inside
hallway
the
house
is
narrow
in
the
extreme
and
the
secret
of
its
successful
renaissance
is
plenty
of
windows
and
light
color
and
mirrors
mirrors
mirrors
it
has
been
called
the
little
house
of
many
mirrors
for
so
much
of
its
spaciousness
and
charm
is
the
effect
of
skilfully
managed
reflections
the
are
most
ingeniously
planned
there
are
landings
that
lead
directly
from
the
stairs
into
the
rooms
of
each
floor
and
back
of
one
of
the
mirrored
stair
walls
there
is
a
little
balcony
connecting
the
rooms
on
that
floor
a
private
passageway
the
and
occupy
the
first
floor
the
is
a
pleasant
friendly
place
full
of
quiet
color
the
walls
are
a
deep
cream
color
and
the
floor
is
covered
with
a
beautiful
savonnerie
rug
there
are
many
beautiful
old
chairs
covered
with
aubusson
tapestry
and
other
chairs
and
sofas
covered
with
rose
colored
brocade
this
is
seemingly
a
huge
place
this
effect
being
given
by
the
careful
placing
of
mirrors
and
lights
and
the
skilful
arrangement
of
the
furniture
i
believe
in
plenty
of
optimism
and
white
paint
comfortable
chairs
with
lights
beside
them
open
fires
on
the
hearth
and
flowers
wherever
they
belong
mirrors
and
sunshine
in
all
rooms
but
i
think
we
can
carry
the
white
paint
idea
too
far
i
have
grown
a
little
tired
of
decorations
of
plain
white
walls
and
white
woodwork
of
carefully
matched
furniture
and
somehow
the
feeling
of
is
lost
when
the
decorator
is
too
careful
in
this
there
is
furniture
of
many
woods
there
are
stuffs
of
many
weaves
there
are
candles
and
chandeliers
and
but
there
is
harmony
of
purpose
and
therefore
harmony
of
effect
the
room
was
made
for
conversation
for
hospitality
a
narrow
landing
connects
the
and
the
the
color
of
the
has
grown
of
itself
from
the
superb
chinese
rug
on
the
floor
and
the
rare
old
mennoyer
drawings
inset
in
the
walls
the
woodwork
and
walls
have
been
painted
a
soft
gray
the
walls
are
broken
into
panels
by
a
narrow
gray
molding
and
the
mennoyers
are
set
in
five
of
these
panels
in
one
narrow
panel
a
beautiful
wall
clock
has
been
placed
above
the
mantel
there
is
a
huge
mirror
with
a
panel
in
black
and
white
relief
above
it
on
the
opposite
wall
there
is
another
mirror
with
a
console
table
of
carved
wood
painted
gray
beneath
it
there
is
also
a
console
table
under
one
of
the
mennoyers
the
two
windows
in
this
room
are
obviously
windows
by
day
but
at
night
two
sliding
doors
of
mirrors
are
drawn
just
as
a
curtain
would
be
drawn
to
fill
the
window
spaces
this
is
a
little
bit
tricky
i
admit
but
it
is
a
very
good
trick
the
is
of
carved
wood
painted
gray
and
covered
with
yellow
damask
which
in
turn
is
covered
with
a
sheet
of
plate
glass
the
chairs
are
covered
with
a
blue
and
gold
striped
velvet
the
rug
has
a
gold
ground
with
medallions
and
border
of
blue
ivory
and
rose
near
the
door
that
leads
to
the
service
rooms
there
is
a
huge
screen
made
of
one
piece
of
wondrous
tapestry
no
other
furniture
is
needed
in
the
room
the
third
floor
is
given
over
to
my
bedroom
and
so
forth
and
the
fourth
floor
to
miss
apartments
these
rooms
will
be
discussed
in
other
chapters
the
servants
quarters
in
this
house
are
very
well
planned
in
the
back
yard
that
always
goes
with
a
house
of
this
type
i
had
built
a
new
wing
five
stories
high
connected
with
the
floors
of
the
house
proper
by
passages
on
the
floor
the
passage
becomes
a
butler
pantry
on
the
bedroom
floors
the
passages
are
large
enough
for
and
baths
connecting
with
the
bedrooms
and
for
outer
halls
and
laundries
connecting
with
the
maids
rooms
and
the
back
stairs
in
this
way
you
see
the
maids
can
reach
the
without
invading
the
bedrooms
the
kitchen
and
its
dependencies
occupy
the
first
floor
of
the
new
wing
the
servants
bedrooms
the
next
three
floors
and
the
top
floor
is
made
up
of
clothes
closets
store
rooms
etc
i
firmly
believe
that
the
whole
question
of
household
comfort
evolves
from
the
careful
planning
of
the
service
portion
of
the
house
my
servants
rooms
are
all
attractive
the
woodwork
of
these
rooms
is
white
the
walls
are
cream
the
floors
are
waxed
they
are
all
gay
and
sweet
and
cheerful
with
white
painted
beds
and
chests
of
drawers
and
willow
chairs
and
chintz
curtains
and
that
are
especially
chosen
handed
down
when
they
have
become
too
faded
to
be
used
elsewhere
v
the
treatment
of
walls
surely
the
first
considerations
of
the
house
in
good
taste
must
be
light
air
and
sanitation
instead
of
ignoring
the
relation
of
sanitary
conditions
and
decorative
schemes
the
architect
and
client
of
work
out
these
problems
with
excellent
results
practical
needs
are
considered
just
as
worthy
of
the
architect
as
artistic
achievements
he
is
a
poor
excuse
for
his
profession
if
he
can
not
solve
the
problems
of
utility
and
beauty
and
work
out
the
ultimate
harmony
of
the
if
one
enters
a
room
in
which
true
proportion
has
been
observed
where
the
openings
the
doors
windows
and
fireplace
balance
perfectly
where
the
wall
spaces
are
well
planned
and
the
height
of
the
ceiling
is
in
keeping
with
the
one
is
immediately
convinced
that
here
is
a
beautiful
and
satisfactory
room
before
a
stick
of
furniture
has
been
placed
in
it
all
questions
pertaining
to
the
practical
equipment
and
the
decorative
amenities
of
the
house
should
be
approached
architecturally
if
this
is
done
the
result
can
not
fail
to
be
felicitous
and
our
dream
of
our
house
beautiful
comes
true
before
you
begin
the
decoration
of
your
walls
be
sure
that
your
floors
have
been
finished
to
fulfil
their
purposes
stain
them
or
polish
them
to
a
soft
glow
keep
them
low
in
tone
so
that
they
may
be
backgrounds
we
will
assume
that
the
woodwork
of
each
room
has
been
finished
with
a
view
to
the
future
use
and
decoration
of
the
room
we
will
assume
that
the
ceilings
are
proper
ceilings
that
they
will
stay
in
their
place
the
top
of
the
room
this
is
a
most
daring
assumption
because
there
are
so
many
feeble
and
threatening
ceilings
overhanging
most
of
us
that
good
ones
seem
rare
but
the
ceiling
is
an
architectural
problem
and
you
must
consider
it
in
the
beginning
of
things
it
may
be
beamed
and
have
every
evidence
of
structural
beauty
and
strength
or
it
may
be
beamed
in
a
ridiculous
fashion
that
advertises
the
beams
as
shams
leading
from
nowhere
to
nowhere
it
may
be
a
beautiful
expanse
of
creamy
modeled
plaster
resting
on
a
distinguished
cornice
or
it
may
be
one
of
those
ghastly
ceilings
with
distorted
cupids
and
roses
in
relief
it
may
be
a
rectangle
of
plain
plaster
tinted
cream
or
pale
yellow
or
gray
and
keeping
its
place
serenely
or
it
may
be
a
villainous
stretch
of
hanging
over
your
head
like
the
curse
of
cain
there
are
hundreds
of
magnificent
painted
ceilings
and
vaulted
arches
of
marble
and
gold
but
these
are
not
of
immediate
importance
to
the
woman
who
is
furnishing
a
small
house
and
are
not
within
the
scope
of
this
book
so
let
us
exercise
common
sense
and
face
our
especial
ceiling
problem
in
an
architectural
spirit
if
your
house
has
structural
beams
leave
them
exposed
if
you
like
but
treat
them
as
beams
stain
them
and
wax
them
and
color
the
spaces
between
them
cream
or
tan
or
warm
gray
and
then
make
the
room
beneath
the
beams
strong
enough
in
color
and
furnishings
to
carry
the
impressive
ceiling
if
you
have
an
architect
who
is
also
a
decorator
and
he
has
ideas
for
a
modeled
plaster
ceiling
or
a
ceiling
with
beams
and
cornice
and
a
fine
application
of
ornament
let
him
do
his
best
for
you
but
remember
that
a
fine
ceiling
demands
certain
things
of
the
room
it
covers
if
you
have
a
simple
little
house
with
simple
furnishings
be
content
to
have
your
ceilings
tinted
a
warm
cream
keep
them
always
clean
when
all
these
things
are
settled
floors
and
ceilings
and
woodwork
you
may
begin
to
plan
your
wall
coverings
begin
you
understand
you
will
probably
change
your
plans
a
dozen
times
before
you
make
the
final
decisions
i
hope
you
will
because
inevitably
the
last
opinion
is
best
it
grows
out
of
so
many
considerations
the
main
thing
to
remember
when
you
begin
to
cover
your
walls
is
that
they
are
walls
that
they
are
straight
up
and
down
and
have
breadth
and
thickness
that
they
are
supposedly
strong
in
other
words
that
they
are
a
structural
part
of
your
house
a
wall
should
always
be
treated
as
a
flat
surface
and
in
a
conventional
way
pictorial
flowers
and
lifelike
figures
have
no
place
upon
it
but
conventionalized
designs
may
be
used
successfully
witness
the
delighted
use
of
the
fantastic
landscape
papers
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
walls
should
always
be
obviously
and
not
flimsy
partitions
hung
with
gauds
and
trophies
the
wall
is
the
background
of
the
room
and
so
must
be
flat
in
treatment
and
reposeful
in
tone
walls
have
always
offered
tempting
spaces
for
decoration
our
ancestors
hung
their
walls
with
trophies
our
pioneer
of
may
live
in
an
adobe
hut
but
he
hangs
his
walls
with
things
that
suggest
beauty
and
color
to
him
calendars
and
trophies
and
gaudy
chromos
the
rest
of
his
hut
he
uses
for
the
hard
business
of
living
but
his
walls
are
his
theater
his
literature
his
recreation
the
wolf
skin
will
one
day
give
place
to
a
painting
of
the
chase
the
gaudy
calendars
to
better
things
when
prosperity
comes
but
now
these
crude
things
speak
for
the
pioneer
period
of
the
man
and
therefore
they
are
the
right
things
for
the
moment
how
absurd
would
be
the
refined
etching
and
the
delicate
on
these
clay
walls
even
were
they
within
his
grasp
the
first
impulse
of
all
of
us
is
to
hang
the
things
we
admire
on
our
walls
unfortunately
we
do
not
always
select
papers
and
fabrics
and
pictures
we
will
continue
to
admire
who
does
know
the
woman
who
goes
to
a
shop
and
selects
wall
papers
as
she
would
select
her
gowns
because
they
are
new
and
different
and
pretty
she
selects
a
rich
paper
for
her
hall
and
an
elegant
paper
for
her
the
chances
are
it
is
a
nile
green
moire
paper
for
her
library
she
thinks
a
paper
imitating
an
oriental
fabric
is
the
proper
thing
and
as
likely
as
not
she
buys
gold
paper
for
her
she
finds
so
many
charming
bedroom
papers
that
she
has
no
trouble
in
selecting
a
dozen
of
them
for
insipid
blue
rooms
and
pink
rooms
and
lilac
rooms
she
forgets
that
while
she
wears
only
one
gown
at
a
time
she
will
live
with
all
her
wall
papers
all
the
time
she
decides
to
use
a
red
paper
of
large
figures
in
one
room
and
a
green
paper
with
snaky
stripes
in
the
adjoining
room
but
she
does
try
the
papers
out
she
does
give
them
the
fair
test
of
living
with
them
a
few
days
you
can
always
buy
or
borrow
a
roll
of
the
paper
you
like
and
take
it
home
and
live
with
it
awhile
the
dealer
will
credit
the
roll
when
you
make
the
final
decisions
you
should
assemble
all
the
papers
that
are
to
be
used
in
the
house
and
all
the
fabrics
and
rugs
and
see
what
the
effect
of
the
various
compositions
will
be
one
with
another
you
consider
one
room
alone
unless
it
be
a
bedroom
for
in
our
modern
houses
we
believe
too
thoroughly
in
spaciousness
to
separate
our
living
rooms
by
and
formal
approaches
we
must
preserve
a
certain
amount
of
privacy
and
have
doors
that
may
be
closed
when
need
be
but
we
must
also
consider
the
effect
of
things
when
those
doors
are
open
when
the
color
of
one
room
melts
into
the
color
of
another
illustration
a
painted
wall
broken
into
panels
by
narrow
moldings
to
me
the
most
beautiful
wall
is
the
plain
and
dignified
painted
wall
broken
into
graceful
panels
by
the
use
of
narrow
moldings
with
lighting
fixtures
carefully
placed
and
every
picture
and
mirror
hung
with
classic
precision
this
wall
is
just
as
appropriate
to
the
cottage
as
to
the
house
if
i
could
always
find
perfect
walls
i
always
paint
them
and
never
use
a
yard
of
paper
painted
walls
when
very
well
done
are
dignified
and
restful
and
most
sanitary
the
trouble
is
that
too
few
plasterers
know
how
to
smooth
the
wall
surface
and
too
few
workmen
know
how
to
apply
paint
properly
in
my
new
house
on
east
street
i
have
had
all
the
walls
painted
the
woodwork
is
ivory
white
throughout
the
house
except
in
the
where
the
walls
and
woodwork
are
soft
gray
the
walls
of
most
of
the
rooms
and
halls
are
painted
a
very
deep
tone
of
cream
and
are
broken
into
panels
the
moldings
being
painted
cream
like
the
woodwork
with
such
walls
you
can
carry
out
any
you
may
desire
you
would
think
that
every
woman
would
know
that
walls
are
influenced
by
the
exposure
of
the
room
but
how
often
i
have
seen
bleak
north
rooms
with
walls
papered
in
cold
gray
and
sunshiny
south
rooms
with
red
or
yellow
wall
papers
dull
tones
and
cool
colors
are
always
good
in
south
rooms
and
live
tones
and
warm
colors
in
north
rooms
for
instance
if
you
wish
to
keep
your
rooms
in
one
you
may
have
white
woodwork
in
all
of
them
and
walls
of
varying
shades
of
cream
and
yellow
the
north
rooms
may
have
walls
painted
or
papered
with
a
soft
warm
yellow
that
suggests
creamy
chiffon
over
orange
the
south
rooms
may
have
the
walls
of
a
cool
tone
whether
you
paint
or
paper
your
walls
you
should
consider
the
placing
of
the
most
carefully
if
the
ceiling
is
very
high
the
walls
will
be
more
interesting
if
the
is
placed
three
or
four
feet
below
the
ceiling
line
if
the
ceiling
is
low
the
molding
should
be
within
two
inches
of
the
ceiling
these
measurements
are
not
arbitrary
of
course
every
room
is
a
law
unto
itself
and
no
cut
and
dried
rule
can
be
given
a
fine
frieze
is
a
very
beautiful
decoration
but
it
must
be
fine
to
be
worth
while
at
all
usually
the
dropped
ceiling
is
better
for
the
upper
wall
space
it
goes
without
saying
that
those
dreadful
friezes
perpetrated
by
certain
wall
paper
designers
are
very
bad
form
and
should
never
be
used
indeed
the
very
principle
of
the
ordinary
paper
frieze
is
bad
it
darkens
the
upper
wall
unpleasantly
and
violates
the
good
old
rule
that
the
floors
should
be
darkest
in
tone
the
side
walls
lighter
and
the
ceiling
lightest
the
recent
vogue
of
stenciling
walls
may
be
objected
to
on
this
account
though
a
very
narrow
and
conventional
line
of
stenciling
may
sometimes
be
placed
just
under
the
picture
rail
with
good
effect
in
a
great
room
with
a
beamed
ceiling
and
oak
paneled
walls
a
painted
fresco
or
a
frieze
of
tapestry
or
some
fine
fabric
is
a
very
fine
thing
especially
if
it
has
a
lot
of
primitive
red
and
blue
and
gold
in
it
but
in
simple
rooms
beware
lately
there
has
been
a
great
revival
of
interest
in
wood
paneling
we
go
abroad
and
see
the
magnificent
paneling
of
old
english
houses
and
we
come
home
and
copy
it
but
we
can
not
get
the
workmen
who
will
carve
panels
in
the
old
patterns
we
can
not
wait
a
hundred
years
for
the
soft
bloom
that
comes
from
the
constant
usage
and
so
our
paneled
rooms
are
apt
to
be
too
new
and
woody
but
we
have
such
a
wonderful
store
of
woods
here
in
america
it
is
worth
while
to
panel
our
rooms
copying
the
simple
rectangular
english
patterns
and
it
is
quite
permissible
to
age
our
walls
by
rubbing
in
black
wax
and
little
shadows
of
and
in
fact
by
any
method
we
can
devise
wood
paneled
walls
like
beamed
ceilings
are
best
in
great
rooms
they
make
boxes
of
little
ones
painted
walls
and
walls
hung
with
tapestries
and
leather
are
not
possible
to
many
of
us
but
they
are
the
most
magnificent
of
wall
treatments
i
know
a
wonderful
library
with
walls
hung
in
squares
of
spanish
leather
a
cold
northern
room
that
merits
such
a
brilliant
wall
treatment
the
primitive
colors
of
the
cordova
leather
workers
with
gold
and
crimson
dominant
glow
from
the
deep
shadows
spanish
and
italian
furniture
and
fine
old
velvets
and
brocades
furnish
this
room
the
same
sort
of
room
invites
wood
paneling
and
tapestry
whereas
the
ideal
room
for
painted
walls
in
a
lighter
key
is
the
ballroom
or
some
such
large
apartment
i
once
decorated
a
ballroom
with
pillement
panels
copied
from
a
beautiful
eighteenth
century
room
and
so
managed
to
bring
a
riot
of
color
and
decoration
into
a
large
apartment
the
ground
of
the
paneling
was
deep
yellow
and
all
the
little
birds
and
flowers
surrounding
the
central
design
were
done
in
the
very
brightest
strongest
colors
imaginable
the
various
panels
had
quaint
little
scenes
of
the
same
chinese
flavor
of
course
in
such
an
apartment
as
a
ballroom
there
would
be
nothing
to
break
into
the
decorative
plan
of
the
painted
walls
and
the
unbroken
polished
floor
serves
only
to
throw
the
panels
into
their
proper
prominence
painted
walls
when
done
in
some
such
broad
and
daring
manner
are
very
wonderful
but
they
should
not
be
attempted
by
the
amateur
or
indeed
by
an
expert
in
a
room
that
will
be
crowded
with
furniture
and
curtains
and
rugs
if
your
walls
are
faulty
you
must
resort
to
wall
papers
or
fabrics
properly
selected
wall
papers
are
not
to
be
despised
the
woodwork
of
a
room
of
course
directly
influences
the
treatment
of
its
walls
so
many
people
ask
me
for
advice
about
wall
papers
and
forget
absolutely
to
tell
me
of
the
finish
of
the
framing
of
their
wall
spaces
a
pale
yellowish
cream
wall
paper
is
very
charming
with
woodwork
of
white
but
it
would
not
do
with
woodwork
of
heavy
oak
for
instance
illustration
a
wall
paper
of
elizabethan
design
with
oak
furniture
a
general
rule
to
follow
in
a
small
house
is
do
not
have
a
figured
wall
paper
if
you
expect
to
use
things
of
large
design
in
your
rooms
if
you
have
gorgeous
rugs
and
hangings
keep
your
walls
absolutely
plain
in
furnishing
the
colony
club
i
used
a
ribbon
grass
paper
in
the
hallway
the
fresh
green
and
white
striped
paper
is
very
delightful
with
a
carpet
and
runner
of
plain
velvet
and
white
woodwork
and
dark
mahogany
furniture
and
many
mirrors
in
another
room
in
this
building
where
many
chintzes
and
fabrics
were
used
i
painted
the
woodwork
white
and
the
walls
a
soft
cream
color
in
the
bedrooms
i
used
a
number
of
wall
papers
the
most
fascinating
of
these
perhaps
is
in
the
bird
room
the
walls
are
hung
with
a
daringly
gorgeous
paper
covered
with
birds
birds
of
paradise
and
paroquets
perched
on
flowery
tropical
branches
the
furniture
in
this
room
is
of
black
and
gold
lacquer
and
the
rug
and
hangings
are
of
jade
green
it
would
not
be
so
successful
in
a
room
one
lived
in
all
the
year
around
but
it
is
a
good
example
of
what
one
can
do
with
a
tempting
wall
paper
in
an
occasional
room
a
guest
room
for
instance
some
of
the
figured
wall
papers
are
so
decorative
that
they
are
more
than
tempting
they
are
compelling
the
chinese
ones
are
particularly
fascinating
recently
i
planned
a
small
boudoir
in
a
country
house
that
depended
on
a
gay
chinoiserie
paper
for
its
charm
the
design
of
the
paper
was
made
up
of
quaint
little
figures
and
parasols
and
birds
and
twisty
trees
all
in
soft
tones
of
green
and
blue
and
mauve
on
a
deep
cream
ground
the
woodwork
and
ceiling
repeated
the
deep
cream
and
the
simple
furniture
a
day
bed
a
chest
of
drawers
and
several
chairs
were
of
wood
painted
a
flat
blue
green
just
the
color
of
the
twisty
of
the
paper
we
had
a
delightful
time
decorating
the
furniture
with
blue
and
mauve
lines
and
we
painted
parasols
and
birds
and
flowers
on
chair
backs
and
and
so
forth
the
large
rug
was
of
and
the
coverings
of
the
day
bed
and
chairs
were
of
a
mauve
and
gray
striped
stuff
the
stripes
so
small
that
they
had
the
effect
of
being
threads
of
color
there
were
no
pictures
of
course
but
there
was
a
long
mirror
above
the
chest
of
drawers
and
another
over
the
mantel
the
candlesticks
and
appliqués
were
of
carved
and
painted
wood
with
shades
of
thin
mauve
silk
over
rose
among
the
most
enchanting
of
the
new
papers
are
the
black
and
white
ones
fantastic
chinese
designs
and
startling
austrian
patterns
black
and
white
is
always
a
tempting
combination
to
the
decorator
and
now
that
josef
hoffman
the
great
austrian
decorator
has
been
working
in
black
and
white
for
a
number
of
years
the
more
venturesome
decorators
of
france
and
england
and
america
have
begun
to
follow
his
lead
and
are
using
black
and
white
and
black
and
color
with
amazing
effect
we
have
black
papers
patterned
in
color
and
black
velvet
carpets
and
white
coated
papers
sprinkled
with
huge
black
polka
dots
and
all
manner
of
unusual
things
it
goes
without
saying
that
much
of
this
fad
is
freakish
but
there
is
also
much
that
is
good
enough
and
refreshing
enough
to
last
one
can
imagine
nothing
fresher
than
a
black
and
white
scheme
in
a
bedroom
with
a
saving
neutrality
of
gray
or
some
dull
tone
for
rugs
and
a
brilliant
bit
of
color
in
porcelain
there
is
no
hint
of
the
mournful
in
the
decorator
combination
of
black
and
white
rather
there
is
a
naïve
quality
suggestive
of
smartness
in
a
gown
or
chic
in
a
woman
a
white
walled
room
with
white
woodwork
and
a
black
and
white
tiled
floor
a
black
lacquer
bed
and
chest
of
drawers
and
chair
glass
curtains
of
white
muslin
and
inside
ones
of
black
and
white
hoffman
chintz
a
splash
of
warm
in
an
oval
rug
at
the
bedside
if
it
be
winter
or
a
cool
green
one
in
summer
does
this
tempt
you
i
once
saw
a
little
wearing
a
calico
gown
black
crosses
on
a
white
ground
and
i
was
so
enchanted
with
the
cool
crispness
of
it
that
i
had
a
glazed
wall
paper
made
in
the
same
design
i
have
used
it
in
bedrooms
and
in
bathrooms
always
with
admirable
effect
one
can
imagine
a
girl
making
a
pierrot
and
pierrette
room
for
herself
given
whitewashed
walls
white
woodwork
and
white
painted
furniture
an
ordinary
white
cotton
printed
with
large
black
polka
dots
would
make
delightful
curtains
and
so
forth
the
rug
might
be
woven
of
black
and
white
rags
or
might
be
one
of
those
woven
from
the
old
homespun
coverlet
patterns
the
landscape
papers
that
were
so
popular
in
the
new
england
and
southern
houses
three
generations
ago
were
very
wonderful
when
they
were
used
in
hallways
with
graceful
stairs
and
white
woodwork
but
they
were
distressing
when
used
in
it
is
all
very
well
to
cover
the
walls
of
your
hall
with
a
paper
or
a
landscape
or
a
foliage
paper
because
you
get
only
an
impressionistic
idea
of
a
hall
you
do
loiter
there
but
papers
of
large
design
are
out
of
place
in
rooms
where
pictures
and
books
are
used
if
there
is
anything
more
dreadful
than
a
busy
parlor
paper
with
scrolls
that
tantalize
or
flowers
that
demand
to
be
counted
i
have
yet
to
encounter
it
remember
above
all
things
that
your
walls
must
be
beautiful
in
themselves
they
must
be
plain
and
quiet
ready
to
receive
sincere
things
but
quite
good
enough
to
get
along
without
pictures
if
necessary
a
wall
that
is
broken
into
beautiful
spaces
and
covered
with
a
soft
creamy
paint
or
paper
or
grasscloth
is
good
enough
for
any
room
it
may
be
broken
with
lighting
fixtures
and
it
is
finished
illustration
the
scheme
of
this
room
grew
from
the
jars
on
the
mantel
vi
the
effective
use
of
color
what
a
joyous
thing
is
color
how
influenced
we
all
are
by
it
even
if
we
are
unconscious
of
how
our
sense
of
restfulness
has
been
brought
about
certain
colors
are
antagonistic
to
each
of
us
and
i
think
we
should
try
to
learn
just
what
colors
are
most
sympathetic
to
our
own
individual
emotions
and
then
make
the
best
of
them
if
you
are
inclined
to
a
hasty
temper
for
instance
you
should
not
live
in
a
room
in
which
the
prevailing
note
is
red
on
the
other
hand
a
timid
delicate
nature
could
often
gain
courage
and
poise
by
living
in
surroundings
of
rich
red
tones
the
tones
of
the
old
italian
damasks
in
which
the
primitive
colors
of
the
middle
ages
have
been
handed
down
to
us
no
half
shades
no
blending
of
tender
tones
are
needed
in
an
age
of
iron
nerves
people
worked
hard
and
they
got
downright
blues
and
reds
and
greens
primitive
colors
all
nowadays
we
must
consider
the
effect
of
color
on
our
nerves
our
eyes
our
moods
everything
love
of
color
is
an
emotional
matter
just
as
much
as
love
of
music
the
strongest
the
most
intense
feeling
i
have
about
decoration
is
my
love
of
color
i
have
felt
as
intimate
a
satisfaction
at
mark
at
twilight
as
i
ever
felt
at
any
opera
though
i
love
music
color
the
very
word
would
suggest
warm
and
agreeable
arrangement
of
tones
a
pleasing
and
encouraging
atmosphere
which
is
full
of
life
we
say
that
one
woman
is
so
full
of
color
when
she
is
alert
and
happy
and
vividly
alive
we
say
another
woman
is
colorless
because
she
is
bleak
and
chilling
and
unfriendly
we
demand
that
certain
music
shall
be
full
of
color
and
we
always
seek
color
in
the
pages
of
our
favorite
books
one
poet
has
color
and
to
spare
another
is
cynical
and
hard
and
gray
we
think
and
criticize
from
the
standpoint
of
an
appreciation
of
color
although
often
we
have
not
that
appreciation
there
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
the
person
who
appreciates
color
and
the
person
who
likes
colors
the
child
playing
with
his
broken
toys
and
bits
of
gay
china
and
glass
the
american
indian
with
his
gorgeous
blankets
and
baskets
and
beads
all
these
primitive
minds
enjoy
the
combination
of
vivid
tones
but
they
have
no
more
feeling
for
color
than
a
blind
man
the
appreciation
of
color
is
a
subtle
and
intellectual
quality
sparrow
the
englishman
who
has
written
so
many
books
on
housefurnishing
says
colors
are
like
musical
notes
and
chords
while
color
is
a
pleasing
result
of
their
artistic
use
in
a
combined
way
so
colors
are
means
to
an
end
while
color
is
the
end
itself
the
first
are
tools
while
the
other
is
a
distinctive
harmony
in
art
composed
of
many
lines
and
shades
we
are
aware
that
some
people
are
but
we
do
not
take
the
trouble
to
ascertain
whether
the
majority
of
people
see
colors
crudely
i
suppose
there
are
as
many
people
as
there
are
people
who
have
a
deep
feeling
for
color
and
the
great
masses
of
people
in
between
while
they
know
colors
one
from
another
have
no
appreciation
of
hue
just
as
surely
there
are
some
people
who
can
not
tell
one
tune
from
another
and
some
people
who
have
a
deep
and
passionate
feeling
for
music
while
the
rest
the
great
majority
of
people
can
follow
a
tune
and
sing
a
hymn
but
they
can
go
no
deeper
into
music
than
that
surely
each
of
you
must
know
your
own
you
know
whether
you
get
results
do
you
i
have
never
believed
that
there
is
a
woman
so
blind
that
she
can
not
tell
good
from
bad
effects
even
though
she
may
not
be
able
to
tell
one
room
is
good
and
another
bad
it
is
as
simple
as
the
problem
of
the
woman
and
the
dowdy
one
the
dowdy
woman
does
realize
the
degree
of
her
own
dowdiness
but
she
that
her
neighbor
is
and
she
envies
her
with
a
vague
and
pathetic
envy
if
then
you
are
not
sure
that
you
appreciate
color
if
you
feel
that
you
like
your
children
like
the
green
rug
with
the
red
roses
because
it
is
so
cheerful
you
may
be
sure
that
you
should
let
alone
and
furnish
your
house
in
neutral
tones
depending
on
and
flowers
and
open
fires
and
the
necessary
small
furnishings
for
your
color
then
with
an
excellent
background
of
soft
quiet
tones
you
can
venture
a
little
way
at
a
time
trying
a
bit
of
color
here
for
a
few
days
and
asking
yourself
if
you
honestly
like
it
and
then
trying
another
color
a
jar
or
a
bowl
or
a
length
of
fabric
somewhere
else
and
trying
that
out
you
will
soon
find
that
your
joy
in
your
home
is
growing
and
that
you
have
a
source
of
happiness
within
yourself
that
you
had
not
suspected
i
believe
that
good
taste
can
be
developed
in
any
woman
just
as
surely
as
good
manners
are
possible
to
anyone
and
good
taste
is
as
necessary
as
good
manners
we
may
take
our
first
lessons
in
color
from
nature
on
whose
storehouse
we
can
draw
limitlessly
nature
when
she
plans
a
wondrous
splash
of
color
prepares
a
proper
background
for
it
she
gives
us
color
plans
for
all
the
needs
we
can
conceive
white
and
gray
clouds
on
a
blue
sky
what
more
could
she
use
in
such
a
composition
a
bit
of
gray
green
moss
upon
a
black
rock
a
field
of
yellow
dandelions
a
pink
and
white
spike
of
hollyhocks
an
butterfly
poised
on
a
stalk
of
larkspur
what
are
these
illustration
a
louis
seize
bedroom
in
rose
and
blue
and
cream
i
think
that
the
first
consideration
after
you
have
settled
your
should
be
to
place
your
house
so
that
its
windows
may
frame
nature
own
pictures
with
windows
facing
north
and
south
where
all
the
fluctuating
and
wayward
charm
of
the
season
unrolls
before
your
eyes
your
windows
become
the
finest
pictures
that
you
can
have
when
this
has
been
arranged
it
is
time
to
consider
the
for
the
interior
of
the
house
the
colors
that
shall
be
in
harmony
with
the
vistas
the
colors
that
shall
be
backgrounds
for
the
intimate
personal
furnishings
of
your
daily
life
you
must
think
of
your
walls
as
backgrounds
for
the
colors
you
wish
to
bring
into
your
rooms
and
by
colors
i
do
not
mean
merely
the
primary
colors
red
and
blue
and
yellow
or
the
secondary
colors
green
and
orange
and
violet
i
mean
the
white
spaces
the
black
shadows
the
gray
halftones
the
suave
creams
that
give
you
the
of
color
how
often
we
get
a
more
definite
idea
of
brilliant
color
from
a
room
with
dark
and
severe
furniture
and
no
ornaments
no
actual
color
save
the
blue
sky
framed
by
the
windows
and
the
flood
of
sunshine
that
glorifies
everything
than
from
a
room
that
has
a
dozen
fine
colors
carefully
brought
together
in
its
furnishings
we
must
decide
our
wall
colors
by
the
aspect
of
our
rooms
rooms
facing
south
may
be
very
light
gray
cream
or
even
white
but
northern
rooms
should
be
rich
in
color
and
should
suggest
warmth
and
just
a
little
mystery
some
of
you
have
seen
the
sala
di
cambio
at
perugia
do
you
remember
how
dark
it
seems
when
one
enters
and
how
gradually
the
wonderful
coloring
glows
out
from
the
gloom
and
one
is
comforted
and
soothed
into
a
sort
of
dreamland
of
pure
joy
in
the
intimate
satisfaction
of
it
all
it
is
unsurpassable
for
sheer
decorative
charm
i
think
for
south
rooms
blues
and
grays
and
cool
greens
and
all
the
dainty
gay
colors
are
charming
do
you
remember
the
song
edna
may
used
to
sing
in
the
belle
of
new
york
i
am
not
sure
of
quoting
correctly
but
the
refrain
was
follow
the
light
i
have
so
often
had
it
in
mind
when
i
been
planning
my
color
schemes
follow
the
light
but
light
colors
for
sunshine
remember
and
dark
ones
for
shadow
for
north
rooms
i
am
strongly
inclined
to
the
use
of
paneling
in
our
native
american
woods
that
are
so
rich
in
effect
but
alas
so
little
used
i
hope
our
architects
will
soon
realize
what
delightful
and
inexpensive
rooms
can
be
made
of
pine
and
cherry
chestnut
and
cypress
and
the
beautiful
california
redwood
i
know
of
a
library
paneled
with
cypress
the
beamed
ceiling
the
paneled
walls
the
shelves
the
ample
chairs
and
long
tables
are
all
of
the
soft
brown
cypress
here
if
anywhere
you
would
think
a
monotony
of
brown
wood
would
be
obvious
but
think
of
the
thousands
of
books
with
brilliant
bindings
think
of
the
green
branches
of
trees
seen
through
the
casement
windows
think
of
the
huge
fireplace
with
its
logs
blazing
in
orange
and
yellow
and
vermillion
flame
think
of
the
distinction
of
a
copper
bowl
of
yellow
flowers
on
the
long
brown
table
ca
you
see
that
this
cypress
room
is
simply
glowing
with
color
i
wish
that
i
might
be
able
to
show
all
you
young
married
girls
who
are
working
out
your
just
how
to
work
out
the
color
of
a
room
suppose
you
are
given
some
rare
and
lovely
jar
or
a
wee
rug
or
a
rare
old
print
or
even
a
quaint
old
chair
from
long
ago
and
build
a
room
around
it
i
have
some
such
point
of
interest
in
every
room
i
build
and
i
think
that
is
why
some
people
like
my
rooms
they
feel
without
quite
knowing
why
that
i
have
loved
them
while
making
them
now
there
is
a
little
and
bedroom
combined
in
a
certain
new
york
house
that
i
worked
out
from
a
pair
of
chinese
jars
they
were
the
oddest
things
of
a
sort
of
and
mauve
and
mulberry
with
flecks
of
black
on
a
cream
porcelain
ground
first
i
found
a
wee
oriental
rug
that
repeated
the
colors
of
the
jugs
this
was
to
go
before
the
hearth
then
i
worked
out
the
shell
of
the
room
the
woodwork
white
the
walls
bluish
green
the
plain
carpet
a
soft
green
i
designed
the
furniture
and
had
it
made
by
a
skilful
carpenter
for
i
could
find
none
that
would
harmonize
with
the
room
the
day
bed
which
is
inches
wide
is
built
like
a
wide
roomy
sofa
one
would
never
suspect
it
of
being
a
plain
bed
still
it
makes
no
pretensions
to
anything
else
for
it
has
the
best
of
springs

most
comfortable

mattresses

soft

running

the

are

delightful

birds
and
flowers
are
patterned

are
several
easy
chairs
cushioned
with
this
chintz

the
window
hangings
are
also
of
it
the
chest
of
drawers
is
painted
in
the

manner

are
glass
knobs
on
the
drawers

glass
covers
the
top
of

an
old
painting
hangs
above
it
the
open
bookshelves
are
perfectly
plain
in
construction
they
are
painted
the
same
and
the
only
decoration
is
the
line
of
dark
green
about
half
an
inch
from
the
edge
any
woman
who
is
skilful
with
her
brush
could
decorate
furniture
of
this
kind
and
i
daresay
many
women
could
build
it

the
color

know
the
roses
that
become
lavender
when
they
fade
the

marble
and
over
it
there
is
an
old

of
some
of
those

guiltless

open

can
fail
to
feel
how
much
better
our
conversation
might
be
were
we
not
forever
conscious
that
between
our
guests
and
the
greedy
ears
of
our
servants
there
is
nothing
but
a
curtain
all
that
curtains
ever
were
used
for
in
the
eighteenth
century
was
as
a
means
of
shutting
out
drafts
in
large
rooms
inadequately
heated
by
wood
fires
how
often
do
we
see
masses
of
draperies
looped
back
and
arranged
with
elaborate
tassels
and
fringes
that
mean
nothing
these
curtains
do
not
even
draw
i
am
sure
that
a
good
door
with
a
simple
and
hinges
would
be
much
less
costly
than
velvet
hangings
a
door
is
not
an
ugly
object
to
be
concealed
for
very
shame
but
a
fine
architectural
detail
of
great
value
consider
the
french
and
italian
doors
with
their
architraves
how
fine
they
are
how
imposing
how
honest
and
how
well
they
compose
of
course
if
your
house
has
been
built
with
open
archways
you
will
need
heavy
curtains
for
them
but
there
are
curtains
curtains
if
you
need
portieres
at
all
you
need
them
to
cut
off
one
room
from
another
and
so
they
should
hang
in
straight
folds
they
should
be
just
what
they
pretend
to
be
honest
curtains
with
a
duty
to
fulfil
for
the
simple
house
they
may
be
made
of
velvet
or
velveteen
in
some
neutral
tone
that
is
in
harmony
with
the
rugs
and
furnishings
of
the
rooms
that
are
to
be
divided
they
should
be
double
usually
and
a
faded
gilt
gimp
may
be
used
as
an
outline
or
as
a
binding
there
are
also
excellent
fabrics
reproducing
old
brocades
and
even
old
tapestries
but
it
is
well
to
be
careful
about
using
these
fabrics
there
are
tapestries
of
foliage
designs
in
soft
greens
and
tans
and
browns
on
a
dark
blue
ground
that
are
very
pleasing
many
of
these
stuffs
copy
in
color
and
design
the
verdure
tapestries
and
some
of
them
have
fine
blues
and
greens
suggestive
of
gobelin
these
stuffs
are
very
wide
and
comparatively
inexpensive
i
thoroughly
advise
a
stuff
of
this
kind
but
i
heartily
condemn
the
imitations
of
the
old
tapestries
that
are
covered
with
large
figures
and
intricate
designs
these
old
tapestries
are
as
distinguished
for
their
colors
their
textures
and
their
very
crudities
as
for
their
supreme
beauty
of
coloring
it
would
be
foolish
to
imitate
them
as
for
windows
and
their
curtains
i
could
write
a
book
about
them
a
window
is
such
a
gay
animate
thing
by
day
it
should
be
full
of
sunshine
and
if
it
frames
a
view
worth
seeing
the
view
should
be
a
part
of
it
by
night
the
window
should
be
hidden
by
soft
curtains
that
have
been
drawn
to
the
side
during
the
sunshiny
hours
in
most
houses
there
is
somewhere
a
group
of
windows
that
calls
for
an
especial
kind
of
curtain
if
these
windows
look
out
over
a
pleasant
garden
or
upon
a
vista
of
fields
and
trees
or
even
upon
a
striking
of
housetops
you
will
be
wise
to
use
a
thin
sheer
glass
curtain
through
which
you
can
look
out
but
which
protects
you
from
the
gaze
of
if
your
group
of
windows
is
so
placed
that
there
is
no
danger
of
people
passing
and
looking
in
then
a
short
sash
curtain
of
swiss
muslin
is
all
that
you
require
with
inside
curtains
of
some
heavier
fabric
chintz
or
linen
or
silk
that
can
be
drawn
at
night
if
you
are
building
a
new
house
i
strongly
advise
you
to
have
at
least
one
room
with
a
group
of
deep
windows
made
up
of
small
panes
of
leaded
glass
and
a
broad
built
beneath
them
there
is
something
so
pleasant
and
mellow
in
leaded
glass
particularly
when
the
glass
itself
has
an
uneven
colorful
quality
when
windows
are
treated
thus
architecturally
they
need
no
glass
curtains
they
need
only
side
curtains

black
chintz
used
in
a
as
for
your
single
windows
when
you
are
planning
them
you
will
be
wise
to
have
the
sashes
so
placed
that
a
broad
sill
will
be
possible
there
is
nothing
pleasanter
than
a
broad
window
sill
at
a
convenient
height
from
the
floor
the
tendency
of
american
builders
nowadays
is
to
use
two
large
glass
sashes
instead
of
the
small
or
panes
of
older
times
this
is
very
bad
from
the
standpoint
of
the
architect
because
these
huge
squares
of
glass
suggest
holes
in
the
wall
whereas
the
square
or
oblong
panes
with
their
straight
frames
and
bars
advertise
their
suitability
the
housewife
objection
to
small
panes
is
that
they
are
harder
to
clean
than
the
large
ones
but
this
objection
is
not
worthy
of
consideration
if
we
really
wish
to
make
our
houses
look
as
if
they
were
built
for
permanency
we
should
consider
everything
that
makes
for
beauty
and
harmony
and
hominess
there
is
nothing
more
interesting
than
a
cottage
window
sash
of
small
square
panes
of
glass
unless
it
be
the
casement
window
of
an
old
english
house
such
windows
are
obviously
windows
the
huge
sheets
of
plate
glass
that
people
are
so
proud
of
are
all
very
well
for
shops
but
they
are
seldom
right
in
small
houses
i
remember
seeing
one
plate
glass
window
that
was
well
worth
while
it
was
in
the
mountain
studio
of
an
artist
and
it
was
fully
eight
by
ten
feet
one
unbroken
sheet
of
glass
which
framed
a
marvelous
vista
of
mountain
and
valley
it
goes
without
saying
that
such
a
window
requires
no
curtain
other
than
one
that
is
to
be
drawn
at
night
the
ideal
treatment
for
the
ordinary
single
window
is
a
soft
curtain
of
some
thin
white
stuff
hung
flat
and
full
against
the
glass
this
curtain
should
have
an
inch
and
a
half
hem
at
the
bottom
and
a
narrow
hem
at
the
sides
it
should
be
strung
on
a
small
brass
rod
and
should
be
placed
as
close
to
the
glass
as
possible
leaving
just
enough
space
for
the
window
shade
beneath
it
the
curtain
should
hang
in
straight
folds
to
the
window
sill
escaping
it
by
half
an
inch
or
so
i
hope
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
go
into
the
matter
of
lace
curtains
here
i
feel
sure
that
no
woman
of
really
good
taste
could
prefer
a
cheap
curtain
of
imitation
lace
to
a
simple
one
of
white
i
have
never
seen
a
house
room
that
was
too
fine
for
a
curtain
though
of
course
there
are
many
rooms
that
would
welcome
no
curtains
whatever
wherein
the
windows
are
their
own
excuse
for
being
lace
curtains
even
if
they
may
have
cost
a
king
ransom
are
in
questionable
taste
to
put
it
mildly
use
all
the
lace
you
wish
on
your
bed
linen
and
table
linen
but
do
not
hang
it
up
at
your
windows
for
to
criticize
illustration
printed
linen
curtains
over
silk
many
women
do
not
feel
the
need
of
inside
curtains
indeed
they
are
not
necessary
in
all
houses
they
are
very
attractive
when
they
are
well
hung
and
they
give
the
window
a
distinction
and
a
decorative
charm
that
is
very
valuable
i
am
using
many
photographs
that
show
the
use
of
inside
curtains
you
will
observe
that
all
of
these
windows
have
glass
curtains
of
plain
white
muslin
no
matter
what
the
inside
curtain
may
be
chintz
curtains
are
often
hung
with
a
valance
about
ten
or
twelve
inches
deep
across
the
top
of
the
window
these
valances
should
be
strung
on
a
separate
rod
so
that
the
inside
curtains
may
be
pulled
together
if
need
be
the
ruffled
valance
is
more
suitable
for
summer
cottages
and
bedrooms
than
for
more
formal
rooms
a
fitted
valance
of
chintz
or
brocade
is
quite
dignified
enough
for
a
or
any
other
in
my
bedroom
i
have
used
a
printed
linen
with
a
flat
valance
this
printed
linen
is
in
soft
tones
of
rose
and
green
on
a
cream
ground
the
side
curtains
have
a
narrow
fluted
binding
of
silk
under
these
curtains
are
still
other
curtains
of
shot
silk
and
beneath
those
are
white
muslin
glass
curtains
with
such
a
window
treatment
the
shot
silk
curtains
are
the
ones
that
are
drawn
together
at
night
making
a
very
soft
comforting
sort
of
color
arrangement
you
will
observe
in
this
photograph
that
the
panels
between
doors
and
windows
are
filled
with
mirrors
that
run
the
full
length
from
the
molding
to
the
baseboard
this
is
a
very
beautiful
setting
for
the
windows
of
course
it
is
well
to
remember
that
glass
curtains
should
not
be
looped
back
inside
curtains
may
be
looped
when
there
is
no
illogical
break
in
the
line
it
is
absurd
to
hang
up
curtains
against
the
glass
and
then
draw
them
away
for
glass
curtains
are
supposed
to
be
a
protection
from
the
gaze
of
the
if
you
have
you
can
pull
your
curtains
to
the
side
so
that
you
may
enjoy
the
do
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
your
windows
are
supposed
to
give
you
sunshine
and
air
if
you
drape
them
so
that
you
get
neither
sunshine
nor
air
you
might
as
well
block
them
up
and
do
away
with
them
entirely
to
me
the
most
amazing
evidence
of
the
advance
of
good
taste
is
the
revival
of
chintzes
printed
linens
cottons
and
so
forth
of
the
eighteenth
century
ten
years
ago
it
was
almost
impossible
to
find
a
cretonne
the
beautiful
chintzes
as
we
know
them
were
unknown
now
there
are
literally
thousands
of
these
excellent
fabrics
of
old
and
new
designs
in
the
shops
the
gay
designs
of
the
printed
cottons
that
came
to
us
from
east
india
a
hundred
years
ago
and
the
fantastic
chintzes
known
as
chinese
chippendale
that
were
in
vogue
when
the
dutch
east
india
company
supplied
the
world
with
its
china
and
fabrics
the
dainty
french
de
that
are
reminiscent
of
marie
antoinette
and
her
bewitching
apartments
and
the
printed
linens
of
old
england
and
later
ones
of
the
england
of
william
morris
all
these
are
at
our
service
there
are
charming
cottons
to
be
had
at
as
little
as
twenty
cents
a
yard
printed
from
old
patterns
there
are
linens
from
old
blocks
that
rival
cut
velvet
in
their
lustrous
color
effect
and
cost
almost
as
much
there
are
amazing
fabrics
that
seem
to
have
come
from
the
land
of
the
arabian
nights
they
really
come
from
austria
and
are
dubbed
futurist
and
cubist
and
such
some
of
them
are
inspiring
some
of
them
are
horrifying
but
all
of
them
are
interesting
chintzes
were
usually
very
narrow
and
light
in
ground
but
the
modern
chintz
is
forty
or
fifty
inches
wide
with
a
ground
of
neutral
tone
that
gives
it
distinction
and
defies
dust
when
i
began
my
work
as
a
decorator
of
houses
my
friends
astonished
and
just
a
little
amused
at
my
persistent
use
of
chintz
called
me
the
chintz
decorator
the
title
pleased
me
even
though
it
was
bestowed
in
fun
for
my
theory
has
always
been
that
chintz
when
properly
used
is
the
most
decorative
and
satisfactory
of
all
fabrics
at
first
people
objected
to
my
bringing
chintz
into
their
houses
because
they
had
an
idea
it
was
poor
and
mean
and
rather
a
doubtful
expedient
on
the
contrary
i
feel
that
it
is
infinitely
better
to
use
good
chintzes
than
inferior
silks
and
damasks
just
as
simple
engravings
and
prints
are
preferable
to
doubtful
paintings
the
effect
is
the
thing
one
of
the
chief
objections
to
the
charming
fabric
was
that
people
felt
it
would
become
soiled
easily
and
would
often
have
to
be
renewed
but
in
our
houses
we
no
longer
feel
that
it
is
necessary
to
have
furniture
and
hangings
that
will
conceal
dirt
we
refuse
to
dirt
of
course
chintzes
in
rooms
that
will
have
hard
wear
should
be
carefully
selected
they
should
be
printed
on
linen
or
some
hard
twilled
fabric
and
the
ground
color
should
be
darker
than
when
they
are
to
be
used
in
bedrooms
many
of
the
newer
chintzes
have
dark
grounds
of
blue
mauve
maroon
or
gray
and
a
still
more
recent
chintz
has
a
black
ground
with
fantastic
designs
of
the
most
delightful
colorings
the
black
chintzes
are
reproductions
of
fabrics
that
were
in
vogue
in
they
are
very
good
in
rooms
that
must
be
used
a
great
deal
and
they
are
very
decorative
some
of
them
suggest
old
cut
velvets
they
are
so
soft
and
lustrous
my
greatest
difficulty
in
introducing
chintzes
here
was
to
convert
women
who
loved
their
plush
and
satin
draperies
to
a
simpler
fabric
they
were
unwilling
to
give
up
the
glories
they
knew
for
the
charms
they
knew
not
i
convinced
them
by
showing
them
results
my
first
large
commission
was
the
colony
club
and
i
used
chintzes
throughout
the
club
chintzes
of
cool
grapes
and
leaves
in
the
roof
garden
linens
of
many
soft
colors
in
the
and
english
posy
designs
in
the
bedrooms
and
so
on
throughout
the
building
now
i
am
using
more
chintz
than
anything
else
it
is
as
much
at
home
in
the
new
york
as
in
the
country
cottage
i
can
think
of
nothing
more
charming
for
a
room
in
a
country
house
than
a
furnished
with
gray
painted
furniture
and
a
lovely
chintz
illustration
straight
hangings
of
rose
and
yellow
shot
silk
not
long
ago
i
was
asked
to
furnish
a
small
cottage
the
whole
thing
had
to
be
done
in
a
month
and
the
only
plan
i
had
to
work
on
was
a
batch
of
chintz
samples
that
had
been
selected
for
the
house
i
extracted
the
colorings
of
walls
woodwork
furniture
from
these
chintzes
instead
of
buying
new
furniture
i
dragged
down
a
lot
of
old
things
that
had
been
relegated
to
the
attic
and
painted
them
with
a
dull
ground
color
and
small
designs
adapted
from
the
chintzes
the
lighting
fixtures
wall
brackets
candle
sticks
were
of
carved
wood
painted
in
polychrome
to
match
the
general
scheme
one
chintz
in
particular
i
would
like
to
have
every
woman
see
and
enjoy
it
had
a
ground
of
old
blue
patterned
regularly
with
little
persian
pears
the
old
rug
design
you
know
the
effect
of
this
simple
chintz
with
white
painted
walls
and
furniture
and
woodwork
and
crisp
white
muslin
glass
curtains
was
delicious
the
most
satisfactory
of
all
chintzes
is
the
de
the
designs
are
interesting
and
well
drawn
and
very
much
more
decorative
than
the
designs
one
finds
in
ordinary
silks
and
other
materials
the
chintzes
must
be
appropriate
to
the
uses
of
the
room
well
designed
in
scale
with
the
height
of
the
ceilings
and
so
forth
it
is
well
to
remember
that
rugs
are
most
effective
in
chintz
rooms
wilton
rugs
woven
in
carpet
sizes
are
to
be
had
now
at
all
first

furniture
stores
painted
furniture
is
very
popular
nowadays
and
is
especially
delightful
when
used
in
chintz
rooms
the
furniture
we
see
now
is
really
a
revival
and
reproduction
of
the
old
models
made
by
angelica
kaufman
heppelwhite
and
other
of
their
period
the
old
furniture
is
rarely
seen
outside
of
museums
nowadays
but
it
has
been
an
inspiration
to
modern
decorators
who
are
seeking
ideas
for
simple
and
charming
furniture
a
very
attractive
room
can
be
made
by
taking
unfinished
pieces
of
furniture
that
is
furniture
that
has
not
been
stained
or
painted
and
painting
them
a
soft
field
color
and
then
adding
decorations
of
bouquets
or
garlands
or
birds
or
baskets
reproducing
parts
of
the
design
of
the
chintz
used
in
the
room
of
course
many
of
these
patterns
could
be
copied
by
a
good
draftsman
only
but
others
are
simple
enough
for
anyone
to
attempt
for
instance
i
decorated
a
room
in
soft
cream
gray
yellow
and
cornflower
blue
the
chintz
had
a
cornflower
design
that
repeated
all
these
colors
i
painted
the
furniture
a
very
soft
gray
and
then
painted
little
garlands
of
cornflowers
in
soft
blues
and
on
each
piece
of
furniture
the
walls
were
painted
a
soft
cream
color
the
carpet
rug
of
tan
was
woven
in
one
piece
with
a
blue
stripe
in
the
border
the
color
illustrations
of
this
book
will
give
you
a
very
good
idea
of
how
i
use
chintzes
and
painted
furniture
one
of
the
illustrations
shows
the
use
of
a
black
chintz
in
the
of
a
city
house
the
chintz
is
covered
with
parrots
which
make
gorgeous
splashes
of
color
on
the
black
ground
the
color
of
the
foliage
and
leaves
is
which
shades
into
a
dozen
blues
and
greens
this
tone
has
been
used
in
the
small
things
of
the
room
the
chintz
curtains
are
lined
with
silk
of
this
tone
and
the
valance
at
the
top
of
the
group
of
windows
is
finished
with
a
narrow
silk
fringe
of
this
the
small
candle
shades
the
shirred
shade
of
the
and
the
cushion
of
the
black
lacquer
chair
are
also
of
this
blue
the
walls
of
the
room
are
a
deep
cream
in
tone
and
there
are
a
number
of
old
french
prints
from
some
eighteenth
century
fashion
journals
hung
on
the
cream
ground
the
is
placed
against
the
windows
over
the
radiator
so
that
there
is
light
and
to
spare
for
dressing
half
curtains
of
white
muslin
are
shirred
on
the
sashes
back
of
the
the
quaint
triplicate
mirror
is
of
black
lacquer
decorated
with
chinese
figures
in
gold
and
the
little
cabinet
in
the
corner
is
also
of
black
and
gold
the
chintz
is
used
as
a
covering
for
the
another

shows
the
of
the
bedroom
which
leads
into
this
the
walls
and
the
carpet
are
the
same
in
both
rooms
as
you
see
this
bedroom
depends
absolutely
on
the
rose
and
blue
chintz
for
its
decoration
there
is
a
quaint
bed
painted
a
pale

curtains
are
of
the

with
a

beside
it
the

the
most
convenient

between
the
two

queer
blues
and
the
of
the
chintz
a
very
comfortable
stool
with
a
cushion
of
old
velvet
is
an
added
convenience
the
chintz
curtains
at
the
windows
hang
in
straight
full
folds
a
flat
valance
cut
the
length
of
the
design
of
the
chintz
furnishes
the
top
of
the
two
windows
some
windows
do
not
need
these
valances
but
these
windows
are
very
high
and
need
the
connecting
line
of
color
the

everyone
likes

the

is
a

very
soft
green
and
the
walls
are
tinted
with
the
palest
of
greens
the
woodwork
is
white
and
the
furniture
is
painted
a

is
just
a
little
deeper
than
pearl
a
darker
green

all
the

which
is
further
decorated
with
prim
little
garlands
of
flowers
painted
in
dull
rose

the
mauve
chintz
is
used
for
the
curtains
and
for
the
huge
armchair

two
painted
chairs
there
is
a
little
footstool
covered
with
brocaded
violet
velvet
with
just
a
thread
of
green
showing
on
the
background
the
lighting

are

painted
in
soft
colors
to

two
lamps
made
of
quaint
old
green
jars
with

have
shirred

one
of
these
lamps
is
used
on
the
and
the
other
on
the
little
chest
of
drawers
this
little
chest
of
drawers
by
the
way
is
about
the
simplest
piece
of
furniture
i
can
think
of
for
any
girl
who
can
use
her
brushes
at
all
an
ordinary
chest
of
drawers
should
be
given
several
coats
of
paint
pale
yellow
green
or
blue
as
may
be
preferred
then
a
thin
stripe
of
a
darker
tone
should
be
painted
on
it
this
should
be
outlined
in
pencil
and
then
painted
with
a
deeper
tone
of
green
color
for
instance
an
orange
or
brown
stripe
should
be
used
on
pale
yellow
and
dark
green
or
blue
on
the
pale
green
a
detail
of
the
wall
paper
or
the
chintz
design
may
be
outlined
on
the
panels
of
the
drawers
and
on
the
top
of
the
chest
by
means
of
a
stencil
and
then
painted
with
rather
soft
colors
the
top
of
the
chest
should
be
covered
with
a
piece
of
plate
glass
which
will
have
the
advantage
of
showing
the
design
of
the
cover
and
of
being
easily
cleaned
glass
knobs
add
interest
to
this
piece
of
furniture
a
mirror
with
a
gilt
frame
or
an
unframed
painting
similar
to
the
one
shown
in
the
illustration
would
be
very
nice
above
the
chest
of
drawers

here
are
many
lighting
fixtures
harmoniously
assembled
in
a
viii
the
problem
of
artificial
light
in
all
the
equipment
of
the
modern
house
i
think
there
is
nothing
more
difficult
than
the
problem
of
artificial
light
to
have
the
light
properly
distributed
so
that
the
rooms
may
be
suffused
with
just
the
proper
glow
but
never
a
glare
so
that
the
base
outlets
for
shall
be
at
convenient
angles
so
that
the
wall
lights
shall
be
beautifully
balanced
all
this
means
prodigious
thought
and
care
before
the
actual
placing
of
the
lights
is
accomplished
in
domestic
architecture
light
is
usually
provided
for
some
special
function
to
dress
by
to
read
by
or
to
eat
by
if
properly
considered
there
is
no
reason
why
one
lighting
fixtures
should
not
be
beautiful
as
well
as
utilitarian
however
it
is
seldom
indeed
that
one
finds
lights
that
serve
the
purposes
of
utility
and
beauty
i
have
rarely
i
might
say
never
gone
into
a
builder
house
and
indeed
i
might
say
the
same
of
many
architects
houses
but
that
the
first
things
to
require
changing
to
make
the
house
amenable
to
modern
american
needs
were
the
openings
for
lighting
fixtures
usually
side
openings
are
placed
much
too
near
the
trim
of
a
door
or
window
so
that
no
bracket
can
be
placed
in
the
space
without
encroaching
on
the
molding
another
favorite
mistake
is
to
place
the
two
wall
openings
in
a
long
wall
or
large
panel
so
close
together
that
no
large
picture
or
mirror
or
piece
of
furniture
can
be
placed
against
that
wall
there
is
also
the
tendency
to
place
the
openings
too
high
which
always
spoils
a
good
room
i
strongly
advise
the
woman
who
is
having
a
house
built
or
to
lay
out
her
electric
light
plan
as
early
in
the
game
as
possible
with
due
consideration
to
the
uses
of
each
room
if
there
is
a
high
chest
of
drawers
for
a
certain
wall
the
size
of
it
is
just
as
important
in
planning
the
lighting
fixtures
for
that
wall
as
is
the
width
of
the
fireplace
important
in
the
placing
of
the
lights
on
the
i
advise
putting
a
liberal
number
of
base
openings
in
a
room
for
it
costs
little
when
the
room
is
in
embryo
later
on
when
you
find
you
can
change
your
favorite
table
and
chair
to
a
better
position
to
meet
the
inspiration
of
the
completed
room
and
that
your
can
be
moved
too
because
the
outlet
is
there
ready
for
it
will
come
the
compensating
moments
when
you
congratulate
yourself
on
forethought
there
are
now
fortunately
few
communities
in
america
that
have
not
electric
indeed
i
know
of
many
obscure
little
towns
of
a
thousand
inhabitants
that
have
had
the
luxury
of
electric
lights
for
years
and
have
as
yet
no
gas
or
miraculously
also
the
smaller
the
town
the
cheaper
is
the
cost
of
electricity
this
is
not
a
statement
but
an
observation
from
personal
experience
the
little
town
electricity
is
usually
a
byproduct
of
some
manufacturing
plant
and
current
is
often
sold
at
so
much
per
light
per
month
instead
of
being
measured
by
meter
it
is
pleasant
to
think
that
many
homes
have
bridged
the
smelly
gap
between
candles
and
electricity
in
this
magic
fashion
gas
light
is
more
difficult
to
manage
than
electricity
for
there
is
always
the
cumbersome
tube
and
the
necessity
for
adding
mechanical
accessories
before
a
good
clear
light
is
secured
gas
lamps
are
hideous
for
some
obscure
reason
whereas
there
are
hundreds
of
simple
and
excellent
wall
fixtures
drop
lights
and
reading
lamps
to
be
bought
already
equipped
for
electricity
the
electric
wire
is
such
an
unobtrusive
thing
that
it
can
be
carried
through
a
small
hole
in
any
good
vase
or
jar
and
with
a
suitable
shade
you
have
an
attractive
and
serviceable
reading
light
candlesticks
are
easily
equipped
for
electricity
and
are
the
most
graceful
of
all
fixtures
for
bedside
tables
tea
tables
and
such
it
is
well
to
remember
that
if
a
room
is
decorated
in
dark
colors
the
light
will
be
more
readily
absorbed
than
in
a
room
and
you
should
select
and
place
your
accordingly
bead
covers
fringes
and
silk
shades
all
obscure
the
light
and
it
and
so
require
a
great
force
of
light
to
illuminate
properly
the
subject
of
the
selection
of
is
limitless
there
are
so
many
fixtures
to
be
had
nowadays
good
bad
and
indifferent
that
it
were
impossible
to
point
out
the
merits
and
demerits
of
them
all
there
are
copies
of
all
the
best
lamps
and
lanterns
of
old
europe
and
many
new
designs
that
grew
out
of
modern
american
needs
there
are
louis
xvi
lanterns
simple
enough
to
fit
well
into
many
an
american
hallway
that
offer
excellent
lessons
in
the
simplicity
of
the
master
decorators
of
old
times
contrast
one
of
these
fine
old
lanterns
with
the
mass
of
colored
glass
and
beads
and
crude
lines
and
curves
of
many
modern
hall
lanterns
i
like
a
ceiling
bowl
of
crystal
or
alabaster
with
lights
inside
for
halls
but
the
expense
of
such
a
bowl
is
great
however
i
recently
saw
a
reproduction
of
an
old
alabaster
bowl
made
of
soft
cloudy
glass
not
of
alabaster
which
sold
at
a
fraction
of
the
price
of
the
original
and
it
seemed
to
meet
all
the
requirements
of
course
one
may
easily
spend
as
much
money
on
as
on
the
remainder
of
the
house
but
that
is
no
reason
why
people
who
must
practise
economy
should
admit
ugly
fixtures
into
their
homes
there
are
always
good
and
bad
fixtures
offered
at
the
lowest
and
highest
prices
you
have
no
defense
if
you
build
your
own
house
if
you
are
making
the
best
of
a
rented
house
or
an
apartment
that
is
different
but
good
taste
is
sufficient
armor
against
the
snare
of
gaudy
beads
and
cheap
glass
illustration
detail
of
a
fine
old
french
fixture
of
metal
there
was
recently
an
exhibition
in
new
york
of
the
craftsmanship
of
the
students
of
a
certain
school
of
design
there
were
some
really
beautiful
lanterns
and
wall
brackets
and
reading
lamps
shown
designed
and
executed
by
young
women
who
are
self
supporting
by
day
and
can
give
only
a
few
evening
hours
or
an
occasional
day
to
the
pursuit
of
their
avocation
one
hanging
lantern
of
terra
cotta
was
very
fine
indeed
and
there
were
many
notable
fixtures
there
must
be
easily
tens
of
thousands
of
young
people
who
are
students
in
the
various
schools
of
design
manual
training
high
schools
and
normal
art
schools
why
does
some
manufacturer
of
give
these
young
people
a
chance
to
adapt
the
fine
old
french
and
italian
designs
to
our
modern
needs
why
not
have
your
daughter
or
son
copy
such
an
object
that
has
use
and
beauty
instead
of
encouraging
the
daubing
of
china
or
the
piercing
of
brass
that
leads
to
nothing
and
if
you
a
daughter
or
son
encourage
the
young
artisan
your
neighbor
who
is
trying
to
find
himself
let
him
copy
a
few
good
old
fixtures
for
you
they
will
cost
no
more
than
the
gaudy
vulgar
fixtures
that
are
sold
in
so
many
shops
the
photograph
shown
on
page
illustrates
the
possibility
of
using
a
number
of
in
one
room
the
room
shown
is
my
own
you
will
observe
that
in
this
picture
there
are
many
different
lights
the
two
old
french
fixtures
of
wrought
gilt
which
flank
the
mantel
mirror
hold
wax
candles
the
two
easy
chairs
have
little
tables
beside
them
holding
silver
candlesticks
there
is
also
a
small
table
holding
an
electric
made
of
a
chinese
jar
with
a
shade
of
shirred
silk
the
chandelier
is
a
charming
old
french
affair
of
gracefully
strung
crystal
globules
for
a
formal
occasion
the
chandelier
is
lighted
but
when
we
are
few
we
love
the
fire
glow
and
candlelight
if
we
require
a
stronger
light
for
reading
there
is
the
lamp
the
photograph
here
given
may
suggest
a
superfluous
number
of
lights
but
the
room
itself
does
not
the
wall
fixtures
are
of
gilt
you
see
the
candlesticks
of
silver
the
chandelier
of
crystal
and
the
lamp
of
chinese
porcelain
and
soft
colored
silk
so
one
is
not
conscious
of
the
many
lights
if
all
the
lights
were
screened
in
the
same
way
the
effect
would
be
different
i
use
this
picture
for
this
very
reason
to
show
how
many
lights
may
be
assembled
and
used
in
one
place
in
considering
the
placing
of
these
lights
the
firelight
was
not
forgotten
nor
the
effect
of
the
room
by
day
when
the
sunlight
floods
in
and
these
many
fixtures
become
objects
of
decorative
interest
a
lamp
or
a
wall
fixture
or
a
chandelier
or
a
candlestick
must
be
beautiful
in
itself
beautiful
by
sunlight
if
it
is
really
successful
the
soft
glow
of
night
light
may
make
commonplace
things
beautiful
but
the
final
test
of
a
fixture
is
its
effect
in
relation
to
the
other
furnishings
of
the
room
in
sunlight
illustration
lighting
fixtures
inspired
by
adam
mirrors
the
picture
on
page
shows
the
proper
placing
of
wall
fixtures
when
a
large
picture
is
the
chief
point
of
interest
these
wall
fixtures
are
particularly
interesting
because
they
are
in
the
style
of
the
adam
mirrors
that
hang
on
the
recessed
wall
spaces
flanking
the
chimney
wall
this
photograph
is
a
lesson
in
the
placing
of
objects
of
art
the
large
painting
is
beautifully
spaced
between
the
line
of
the
mantel
shelf
and
the
lower
line
of
the
cornice
the
wall
fixtures
are
correctly
placed
and
anyone
can
see
why
they
would
be
distressingly
out
of
key
if
they
were
nearer
the
picture
or
nearer
the
line
of
the
chimney
wall
the
picture
was
considered
as
an
important
part
of
the
before
the
openings
for
the
fixtures
were
made
another
good
lamp
is
shown
on
the
small
table
in
this
picture
there
is
really
a
beside
a
comfortable
couch
which
can
not
be
seen
in
the
picture
this
lamp
like
the
one
in
the
is
made
from
a
porcelain
vase
with
a
shirred
silk
shade
on
a
wire
frame
an
electric
light
cord
is
run
through
a
hole
bored
for
it
if
electricity
were
not
available
an
oil
receptacle
of
brass
could
be
fitted
into
the
vase
and
the
beauty
of
the
lamp
would
be
the
same
there
are
so
many
possibilities
for
making
beautiful
lamps
of
good
jars
and
vases
that
it
is
surprising
the
shops
still
sell
their
frightful
lamps
covered
with
cabbage
roses
and
dragons
and
monstrosities
a
blue
and
white
ginger
jar
a
copper
or
even
a
homely
brown
earthenware
will
make
a
good
bowl
for
an
oil
or
electric
lamp
but
of
the
dreadful
bowls
sold
in
the
shops
for
the
purpose
the
less
said
the
better
how
can
one
see
beauty
in
a
lurid
bowl
and
shade
of
red
glass
better
stick
to
wax
candles
the
rest
of
your
life
than
indulge
in
such
a
lamp
i
know
people
plead
that
they
have
to
buy
what
is
offered
they
can
not
find
simple
lamps
and
hanging
lanterns
at
small
prices
and
so
they
buy
bad
ones
the
manufacturer
makes
just
the
objects
that
people
demand
so
long
as
you
accept
these
things
just
so
long
will
he
make
them
if
all
the
women
who
complain
about
the
hideous
that
are
sold
were
to
refuse
absolutely
to
buy
them
a
few
years
would
show
a
revolution
in
the
designing
of
these
things
there
has
been
of
late
a
vulgar
fashion
of
having
a
huge
mass
of
colored
glass
and
beads
suspended
from
chains
in
the
of
certain
apartments
and
houses
these
monstrous
things
are
called
domes
no
one
knows
why
for
the
price
of
one
of
them
you
could
buy
a
three
pronged
candlestick
equipped
for
electricity
for
your
table
it
is
the
sight
of
hundreds
of
these
dreadful
domes
in
the
lamp
shops
that
gives
one
a
feeling
of
discouragement
the
humblest
kitchen
lamp
of
brass
and
tin
would
be
beautiful
by
contrast
when
all
is
said
and
done
we
must
come
back
to
wax
candles
for
the
most
beautiful
light
of
all
electricity
is
the
most
efficient
but
candlelight
is
the
most
satisfying
for
a
or
any
formal
room
where
a
clear
light
is
not
required
wax
candles
are
perfect
there
are
still
a
few
houses
left
where
candlesticks
are
things
of
use
and
are
not
banished
to
the
shelves
as
curiosities
certainly
the
clear
white
light
of
electricity
seems
when
one
is
dressing
or
working
but
for
for
the
brief
periods
of
rest
the
only
thing
that
rivals
the
comfort
of
candlelight
is
the
glow
of
an
open
fire
ix
halls
and
staircases
in
early
days
the
hall
was
the
large
formal
room
in
which
the
main
business
of
the
house
was
transacted
it
played
the
part
of
with
the
lord
of
the
manor
as
judge
it
was
used
for
dining
living
and
for
whatever
entertainment
the
house
afforded
the
stairs
were
not
a
part
of
it
they
found
a
place
as
best
they
could
from
the
times
of
the
primitive
ladder
of
the
adobe
dwelling
to
the
days
of
the
spiral
staircase
carried
up
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
the
stairway
was
always
a
primitive
affair
born
of
necessity
with
little
claim
to
beauty
with
the
renaissance
in
italy
came
the
forerunner
of
the
modern
entrance
hall
with
its
accompanying
stair
considerations
of
comfort
and
beauty
began
to
be
observed
the
italian
staircase
grew
into
a
magnificent
affair
and
often
led
only
to
the
open
galleries
and
de
of
the
next
floor
i
think
the
finest
staircases
in
all
the
world
are
in
the
genoese
palaces
the
grand
staircase
of
the
renaissance
may
still
be
seen
in
many
fine
italian
palaces
notably
in
the
bargello
in
florence
this
staircase
has
been
splendidly
reproduced
by
gardner
in
fenway
court
her
italian
palace
in
boston
this
house
is
by
the
way
the
finest
thing
of
its
kind
in
america
gardner
has
the
same
interest
in
the
furtherance
of
an
american
appreciation
of
art
as
had
the
late
pierpont
morgan
she
has
assembled
a
magnificent
collection
of
objects
of
art
and
she
opens
her
house
to
the
public
occasionally
and
to
artists
and
designers
frequently
that
they
may
have
the
advantage
of
studying
the
treasures
to
return
to
our
staircases
in
france
the
intermural
or
spiral
staircase
was
considered
quite
splendid
enough
for
all
human
needs
and
in
the
finest
châteaux
of
the
french
renaissance
one
finds
these
practical
staircases
possibly
in
those
troublous
times
the
french
architects
planned
for
an
aristocracy
living
under
the
influence
of
an
inherited
tradition
of
treachery
and
violence
they
felt
more
secure
in
the
isolation
and
ready
command
of
a
small
narrow
staircase
where
one
man
well
nigh
could
keep
an
army
at
bay
a
large
wide
staircase
of
easy
ascent
might
have
meant
many
uneasy
moments
with
plots
without
and
treachery
within
gradually
however
the
old
feudal
entrance
gave
way
to
its
of
guardroom
vestibule
and
salon
england
was
last
to
capitulate
and
in
the
great
tudor
houses
still
extant
one
finds
the
entrance
door
opening
directly
into
the
hall
often
in
these
english
houses
there
was
a
screen
of
very
beautiful
carved
wood
behind
which
was
the
staircase
inigo
jones
introduced
the
palladian
style
into
england
and
so
brought
in
the
central
salon
which
served
as
means
of
access
to
all
the
house
the
old
english
halls
and
staircases
designed
by
inigo
jones
would
be
perfect
for
our
more
elaborate
american
country
houses
the
severe
beauty
of
english
paneling
and
the
carving
of
and
spindles
are
having
a
just
revival
the
pendulum
swings
and
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
wooden
staircases
with
carved
wooden
balustrades
were
used
oftenest
in
england
while
in
the
french
châteaux
marble
stairs
with
are
generally
found
the
perfection
to
which
the
art
of
iron
work
may
be
carried
is
familiar
to
everyone
who
knows
the
iron
work
of
jean
in
the
stanislas
palace
at
nancy
this
staircase
in
the
hôtel
de
ville
is
supreme
if
you
are
ever
in
france
you
should
see
it
it
has
been
copied
often
by
american
architects
infinite
thought
and
skill
were
brought
to
bear
on
all
the
iron
work
lanterns
and
so
forth
the
artistic
excellence
of
this
work
has
not
been
equaled
since
this
period
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
greatest
artists
of
that
day
did
not
think
it
in
the
least
beneath
their
dignity
and
talent
to
devote
themselves
to
designing
the
knobs
of
doors
the
handles
of
commodes
the
bronzes
for
the
decorations
of
fireplaces
the
shaping
of
hinges
and
locks
they
were
careful
of
details
and
that
is
the
secret
of
their
supremacy
nowadays
we
may
find
a
house
with
a
beautiful
hall
but
the
chances
are
it
is
spoiled
by
crudely
designed
fittings
i
have
written
somewhat
at
length
of
the
magnificent
staircases
of
older
countries
and
older
times
than
our
own
because
somehow
the
subject
is
one
that
can
not
be
considered
apart
from
its
beginnings
all
our
halls
and
stairs
pretentious
or
not
have
come
to
us
from
these
superb
efforts
of
masterly
workmen
and
perhaps
that
is
why
we
feel
instinctively
that
they
must
suggest
a
certain
formality
and
restraint
this
feeling
is
indirectly
a
tribute
to
the
architects
who
gave
us
such
notable
examples
we
do
not
however
have
to
go
abroad
for
historic
examples
of
stately
halls
and
stairs
there
are
fine
old
houses
scattered
all
through
the
old
thirteen
states
that
can
not
be
surpassed
for
dignity
and
simplicity
one
of
the
best
halls
in
america
is
that
of
westover
probably
the
most
famous
house
in
virginia
this
old
house
was
built
in
by
colonel
byrd
on
the
james
river
where
so
many
of
the
colonial
aristocrats
of
virginia
made
their
homes
the
plan
of
the
hall
is
suggestive
of
an
old
english
manor
house
the
walls
are
beautifully
paneled
from
an
old
english
plan
the
turned
balusters
are
representative
of
the
late
seventeenth
or
early
eighteenth
century
the
fine
old
jacobean
chairs
and
tables
have
weathered
two
centuries
and
are
friendly
to
their
new
neighbors
oriental
rugs
older
than
themselves
the
staircase
has
two
landings
on
the
first
of
which
stands
an
old
marking
the
beginning
of
a
custom
that
obtains
to
this
day
this
hall
is
characteristic
of
american
houses
of
the
colonial
period
and
indeed
of
the
average
large
country
house
of
for
the
straightaway
hall
cutting
the
house
squarely
in
two
is
so
much
a
part
of
our
architecture
that
we
use
it
as
a
standard
it
is
to
be
found
somewhat
narrower
and
lower
of
ceiling
in
new
england
farmhouses
and
in
eastern
city
houses
the
southern
house
of
days
varied
the
stair
occasionally
by
patterning
the
magnificent
winding
staircases
of
old
england
but
the
long
hall
open
at
both
ends
and
the
long
stair
with
one
or
two
landings
is
characteristic
of
all
old
american
houses
the
customary
finish
for
these
old
halls
was
a
landscape
wall
paper
a
painted
wall
broken
into
panels
by
molding
a
high
white
wainscoting
with
white
plaster
above
or
possibly
a
gay
figured
paper
of
questionable
beauty
mahogany
furniture
was
characteristic
of
all
these
halls
a
a
table
a
number
of
dignified
chairs
and
a
quaint
old
mirror
sometimes
there
was
a
fireplace
but
oftener
there
were
doors
opening
evenly
into
various
rooms
of
the
first
floor
these
things
are
irreproachable
why
did
we
have
to
go
through
the
period
of
the
walnut
and
shiny
oak
hall
furniture
only
to
return
to
our
simplicities
illustration
the
staircase
in
the
bayard
thayer
house
when
i
planned
the
main
hall
of
the
colony
club
i
determined
to
make
it
very
colonial
very
american
very
inviting
and
comfortable
the
sort
of
hall
you
like
to
remember
having
seen
in
an
old
virginia
house
one
enters
from
the
street
into
a
narrow
hall
that
soon
broadens
into
a
spacious
and
lofty
the
walls
are
of
course
white
the
paneled
spaces
being
broken
by
quaint
old
colonial
mirrors
and
appropriate
there
is
a
great
fireplace
at
one
end
of
the
hall
with
a
deep
davenport
before
it
there
are
also
roomy
chairs
covered
with
the
same
delightful
chintz
a
green
and
white
glazed
english
chintz
that
is
as
serviceable
as
it
is
beautiful
besides
the
chairs
there
are
two
old
english
chairs
covered
with
english
needlework
these
chairs
are
among
the
treasures
of
the
club
there
are
several
long
mahogany
tables
and
many
small
tea
tables
the
rugs
are
of
a
spring
green
i
can
think
of
no
better
name
for
it
in
modern
english
and
american
houses
of
the
smaller
class
the
staircase
is
a
part
of
an
elongated
entrance
hall
and
there
is
often
no
vestibule
in
many
of
the
more
important
new
houses
the
stairs
are
divided
from
the
entrance
hall
so
that
one
staircase
will
do
for
the
servants
family
and
all
and
the
privacy
of
the
entrance
hall
will
be
secured
in
my
own
house
in
new
york
you
enter
the
square
hall
directly
and
the
staircase
is
in
a
second
hall
this
entrance
hall
is
a
real
affording
the
visitor
a
few
moments
of
rest
and
calm
after
the
crowded
streets
of
the
city
the
hall
is
quite
large
with
a
of
black
and
white
and
dark
green
you
will
find
a
description
of
this
hall
in
another
chapter
i
have
used
this
same
plan
in
many
other
city
houses
with
individual
variations
of
course
the
serene
quality
of
such
a
hall
is
very
valuable
in
the
city
if
you
introduced
a
lot
of
furniture
the
whole
thing
would
be
spoiled
i
used
an
old
porcelain
stove
creamy
and
iridescent
in
glaze
in
such
a
hall
in
an
uptown
house
very
similar
to
my
own
the
stove
is
very
beautiful
in
itself
but
it
was
used
for
use
as
well
as
beauty
it
really
holds
a
fire
and
furnishes
an
even
heat
the
stove
was
flanked
by
two
pedestals
surmounted
with
baskets
spilling
over
with
fruits
carved
from
wood
and
gilded
and
painted
in
polychrome
everything
in
this
hall
is
arranged
with
precision
of
balance
the
stove
is
flanked
by
two
pedestals
the
niche
that
holds
the
stove
and
the
corresponding
niche
on
the
other
wall
which
holds
a
statue
are
flanked
by
narrow
panels
holding
the
street
wall
is
broken
by
doors
and
its
two
flanking
windows
the
opposite
wall
has
a
large
central
panel
flanked
by
two
glass
doors
one
leading
to
the
stairway
and
the
other
to
a
closet
beneath
it
everything
is
paired
with
resulting
effect
of
great
formality
and
restraint
very
little
furniture
is
required
a
table
to
hold
cards
and
notes
two
low
benches
and
a
wrought
iron
stand
for
umbrellas
the
windows
have
curtains
of
italian
linen
coarse
homespun
stuff
that
is
very
lovely
with
white
walls
and
woodwork
there
are
no
pictures
on
the
wall
but
there
are
specially
designed
in
the
small
panels
that
frame
the
niches
in
several
of
the
finer
houses
that
have
been
built
recently
notably
that
of
belmont
the
staircase
is
enclosed
and
is
in
no
way
an
architectural
feature
merely
a
possible
means
of
communication
when
needed
this
solution
of
the
staircase
problem
has
no
doubt
brought
about
our
modern
luxury
of
elevators
in
another
fine
private
house
recently
built
the
grand
staircase
only
goes
so
far
as
the
formal
rooms
of
the
second
floor
and
a
small
iron
staircase
enclosed
in
the
wall
leads
to
the
intimate
family
rooms
of
the
bedroom
floor
the
advantage
of
this
gain
in
space
can
easily
be
appreciated
all
the
room
usually
taken
up
by
the
large
wall
of
the
staircase
halls
and
so
forth
can
be
thrown
into
the
bedrooms
upstairs
the
illustrations
of
the
bayard
thayer
hall
and
staircase
speak
for
themselves
here
locks
hinges
have
been
carefully
planned
so
that
the
smallest
part
is
worthy
of
the
whole
this
hall
is
representative
of
the
finer
private
houses
that
are
being
built
in
america
i
had
the
pleasure
of
working
with
the
architect
and
the
owners
here
and
so
was
able
to
fit
the
decorations
and
furnishings
of
the
hall
to
the
house
and
to
the
requirements
of
the
people
who
live
in
it
the
present
tendency
of
people
who
build
small
houses
is
to
make
a
of
the
hall
i
am
not
in
favor
of
this
i
think
the
hall
should
be
much
more
formal
than
the
rest
of
the
house
it
is
after
all
of
public
access
not
only
to
the
but
to
the
street
the
servant
who
answers
the
front
door
must
of
necessity
constantly
traverse
it
so
must
anyone
the
guest
or
tradesman
admitted
to
the
house
the
furniture
should
be
severe
and
architectural
in
design
a
column
or
pedestal
surmounted
with
a
statue
a
fountain
an
old
chest
to
hold
a
carved
bench
a
good
table
a
standing
desk
may
be
used
in
a
large
house
nothing
more
is
admissible
in
a
small
house
a
table
a
bench
or
so
possibly
a
wall
clock
will
be
all
that
is
necessary
the
wall
should
be
plain
in
treatment
the
stair
carpet
should
be
plain
in
color
the
floor
should
be
bare
if
in
good
condition
with
just
a
small
rug
for
softness
at
the
door
a
tiled
floor
is
especially
beautiful
in
a
hall
if
you
can
afford
it
if
your
house
happens
to
have
the
hall
and
combined
and
no
vestibule
you
can
place
a
large
screen
near
the
entrance
door
and
obtain
a
little
more
privacy
a
standing
screen
of
wooden
panels
is
better
than
a
folding
screen
for
the
folding
screen
is
rarely
and
will
be
blown
down
by
the
draft
of
the
open
door
a
standing
screen
may
be
made
by
any
carpenter
and
painted
or
stained
to
match
the
woodwork
of
the
room
a
straight
bench
or
settle
placed
against
it
will
make
the
screened
space
seem
more
like
a
vestibule
another
objection
to
the
staircase
leading
from
the
of
a
small
house
is
that
such
an
arrangement
makes
it
almost
impossible
to
heat
the
house
properly
in
winter
i
have
seen
so
many
bewildered
people
whose
spacious
doorless
downstairs
rooms
were
a
joy
in
summer
shivering
all
winter
long
in
a
polar
atmosphere
the
stair
well
seems
to
suck
all
the
warmth
from
the
and
coal
bills
soar
above
all
do
try
to
make
your
hall
pretty
remember
that
a
hall
is
not
a
but
a
thoroughfare
open
and
used
by
all
the
dwellers
in
the
house
do
be
afraid
of
your
halls
and
stairs
looking
cold
it
is
a
good
idea
to
have
one
small
space
in
your
house
where
you
can
go
and
sit
down
and
be
calm
and
cool
you
ca
keep
the
rest
of
the
house
severe
and
cool
looking
but
here
it
is
eminently
appropriate
and
sensible
the
visitor
who
enters
a
white
and
green
hall
and
gets
an
effect
of
real
reserve
and
coolness
is
all
the
more
appreciative
of
the
warmth
and
intimacy
of
the
of
the
house
after
all
for
simple
american
houses
there
is
nothing
better
than
a
straightaway
staircase
of
broad
and
easy
treads
with
one
or
two
landings
there
may
be
a
broad
landing
with
a
window
and
if
there
is
a
real
view
but
the
that
is
built
for
no
especial
purpose
is
worse
than
useless
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
to
have
the
stairs
carpeted
if
the
treads
are
broad
enough
and
turned
balusters
painted
white
with
a
mahogany
hand
rail
are
in
scheme
such
a
staircase
adds
much
to
the
of
a
house
x
the
a
is
the
logical
place
for
the
elegancies
of
family
life
the
ideal
to
my
mind
contains
many
comfortable
chairs
and
sofas
many
softly
shaded
lights
by
night
and
plenty
of
sunshine
by
day
mirrors
set
in
simple
paneled
walls
and
any
number
of
small
tables
that
may
be
brought
out
into
the
room
if
need
be
and
an
open
fire
the
old
idea
of
the
was
a
horrible
apartment
of
stiffness
and
formality
and
discomfort
no
wonder
it
was
used
only
for
weddings
and
funerals
the
modern
is
intended
primarily
as
a
place
where
a
hostess
may
entertain
her
friends
and
it
must
not
be
chill
and
uninviting
whatever
else
it
may
be
it
should
not
be
littered
up
with
personal
things
magazines
books
and
and
objects
that
belong
in
the
but
it
welcomes
flowers
and
collections
of
fans
or
miniatures
or
graceful
mirrors
or
old
french
prints
or
enamels
or
porcelains
it
should
be
a
place
where
people
may
converse
without
interruption
from
the
children
most
houses
even
of
the
smaller
sort
have
three
day
rooms
the
the
parlor
and
the
as
they
are
usually
called
people
who
appreciate
more
and
more
the
joy
of
living
have
pulled
hall
and
together
into
one
great
family
meeting
place
leaving
a
small
vestibule
decreased
the
size
of
the
and
built
in
many
windows
so
that
it
becomes
almost
an
outdoor
room
and
given
the
parlor
a
little
more
dignity
and
serenity
and
its
right
name
the
we
use
the
terms
and
interchangeably
in
america
though
we
are
a
bit
more
timid
of
the
but
there
is
a
subtle
difference
between
the
two
that
is
worth
noting
the
withdrawing
room
of
old
england
was
the
quiet
room
to
which
the
ladies
retired
leaving
their
lords
to
the
freer
pleasures
of
the
great
hall
indeed
the
room
began
as
a
part
of
my
lady
bedroom
but
gradually
came
into
its
proper
importance
and
took
on
a
magnificence
all
its
own
the
of
france
also
began
as
a
part
of
the
great
hall
or
then
came
the
need
for
an
apartment
for
receiving
and
so
the
great
bed
chamber
was
divided
into
two
parts
one
a
real
and
the
other
a
de
parade
with
a
great
state
bed
for
the
occasional
visitors
of
great
position
the
great
bed
or
de
was
representative
of
all
the
salons
of
the
time
of
louis
xiii
gradually
the
owners
of
the
more
magnificent
houses
saw
the
opportunity
for
a
series
of
salons
and
so
the
state
apartment
was
divided
into
two
parts
a
de
which
afforded
the
family
a
certain
privacy
and
the
de
which
was
sacred
to
a
magnificent
hospitality
and
so
the
salon
expanded
until
nowadays
we
use
the
word
with
awe
and
appreciate
its
implication
of
brilliant
conversation
and
exquisite
decoration
of
a
radiant
hostess
an
amusing
and
distinguished
circle
of
people
the
word
has
a
graciousness
a
challenge
that
we
fear
if
we
have
not
just
the
right
house
we
should
not
dare
risk
belittling
our
pleasant
by
dubbing
it
salon
in
short
a
may
be
a
part
of
any
well
regulated
house
a
salon
is
largely
a
matter
of
spirit
and
cleverness
a
has
no
place
in
the
house
where
there
is
no
other
indeed
if
there
are
many
children
and
the
house
is
of
moderate
size
i
think
a
number
of
small
day
rooms
are
vastly
better
than
the
two
usual
rooms
and
because
only
in
this
way
can
the
various
members
of
the
family
have
a
chance
at
any
privacy
the
one
large
room
so
necessary
for
the
gala
occasions
of
a
large
family
may
be
the
for
here
it
will
be
easy
to
push
back
tables
and
chairs
for
the
occasion
if
the
children
have
a
nursery
and
mother
has
a
small
and
father
has
a
little
room
for
books
and
writing
a
may
be
eliminated
in
favor
of
a
small
formal
room
for
visitors
and
talk
illustration
the
should
be
intimate
in
spirit
no
matter
how
large
your
may
be
keep
it
intimate
in
spirit
there
should
be
a
dozen
conversation
centers
in
a
large
room
there
should
be
one
or
more
sofas
with
comfortable
chairs
pulled
up
beside
them
no
one
chair
should
be
isolated
for
some
bashful
person
who
does
talk
well
anyway
is
sure
to
take
the
most
remote
chair
and
make
herself
miserable
i
have
seen
a
shy
young
woman
completely
changed
because
she
happened
to
sit
upon
a
certain
deep
cushioned
sofa
of
damask
whether
it
was
the
rose
color
or
the
enforced
relaxation
the
sofa
induced
or
the
proximity
of
some
very
charming
people
in
comfortable
chairs
beside
her
or
all
of
these
things
i
know
but
she
found
herself
she
found
herself
gay
and
happy
and
unafraid
i
am
sure
her
personality
flowered
from
that
hour
on
if
she
had
been
left
to
herself
she
would
have
taken
a
stiff
chair
in
a
far
corner
and
she
would
have
been
miserable
and
i
believe
most
firmly
in
the
magic
power
of
inanimate
objects
do
litter
your
with
who
has
seen
what
i
can
best
describe
as
a
souvenir
a
room
filled
with
curiosities
from
everywhere
i
shall
never
forget
doing
a
for
a
woman
of
no
taste
i
persuaded
her
to
put
away
her
heavy
velvets
and
gilt
fringes
and
to
have
one
light
and
spacious
room
in
the
house
she
agreed
we
worked
out
a
chintz
that
was
delicious
i
was
very
happy
over
it
and
you
can
imagine
my
amazement
when
she
came
to
me
and
said
but
miss
de
wolfe
what
am
i
to
do
with
my
blue
satin
tidies
in
my
own
i
have
so
many
objects
of
art
and
yet
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
the
room
has
a
great
serenity
over
the
little
desk
in
one
corner
i
have
my
collection
of
old
miniatures
and
fans
of
the
golden
days
of
the
french
court
there
are
ever
so
many
vases
and
bowls
for
flowers
they
are
there
are
dozens
of
brackets
and
lamps
and
a
chandelier
and
many
candlesticks
and
they
are
used
also
somehow
when
a
beautiful
object
becomes
a
useful
object
it
takes
its
place
in
the
general
scheme
of
things
and
does
not
disturb
the
eye
the
ideal
has
a
real
fireplace
with
a
wood
fire
when
there
is
excuse
for
it
an
open
fire
is
almost
as
great
an
attribute
to
a
as
a
tactful
hostess
it
puts
you
at
ease
instantly
and
gives
you
poise
and
just
as
an
open
fire
and
sunshine
make
for
ease
so
do
well
placed
mirrors
make
for
elegance
use
your
mirrors
as
decorative
panels
not
only
for
the
purpose
of
looking
at
yourself
in
them
and
you
will
multiply
the
pleasures
of
your
room
i
have
the
wall
space
between
mantel
and
filled
with
a
large
mirror
in
my
new
york
and
the
two
narrow
panels
between
the
front
windows
are
filled
with
long
narrow
mirrors
that
reflect
the
color
and
charm
of
the
room
whenever
you
can
manage
it
place
your
mirror
so
that
it
will
reflect
some
particularly
nice
object
given
plenty
of
chairs
and
sofas
and
a
few
small
tables
to
hold
lights
and
flowers
you
will
need
very
little
other
furniture
in
the
you
will
need
a
but
a
very
small
and
orderly
one
the
drawing
room
desk
may
be
very
elegant
in
design
and
equipment
for
it
must
be
a
part
of
the
decoration
of
the
room
and
it
must
be
always
immaculate
for
the
visitor
who
wants
to
write
a
note
the
members
of
the
family
are
supposed
to
use
their
own
desks
leaving
this
one
for
social
emergencies
a
good
desk
is
a
godsend
in
a
it
makes
a
room
that
is
usually
cold
and
formal
at
once
more
livable
and
more
intimate
in
my
own
i
have
a
small
french
placed
near
a
window
so
that
the
light
falls
over
left
shoulder
the
small
black
lacquer
desks
that
are
now
being
reproduced
from
old
models
would
be
excellent
desks
for
because
they
not
only
offer
service
as
all
furniture
should
but
are
beautiful
in
themselves
many
of
the
small
tables
of
walnut
and
mahogany
that
are
sold
as
might
be
used
as
in
formal
rooms
if
the
mirrors
were
eliminated
illustration
the
fine
formality
of
paneling
there
is
a
great
difference
in
opinion
as
to
the
placing
of
the
piano
in
the
i
think
it
belongs
in
the
if
it
is
in
constant
use
though
of
course
it
is
very
convenient
to
have
it
near
by
the
one
big
room
be
it
or
when
a
small
dance
is
planned
i
am
going
to
admit
that
in
my
opinion
there
is
nothing
more
abused
than
the
piano
i
have
no
piano
in
my
own
house
in
new
york
i
love
music
but
i
am
not
a
musician
and
so
i
do
not
expose
myself
to
the
merciless
banging
of
chance
callers
besides
my
house
is
quite
small
and
a
good
piano
would
dwarf
the
other
furnishings
of
my
rooms
i
think
pianos
are
for
musicians
not
strummers
who
spoil
all
chance
for
any
real
conversation
if
you
are
fortunate
enough
to
have
a
musician
in
your
family
that
is
different
go
ahead
and
give
him
a
music
room
musicians
are
not
born
every
day
but
lovers
of
music
are
everywhere
and
i
for
one
am
heartily
in
favor
of
doing
away
with
the
old
custom
of
teaching
every
child
to
bang
a
little
and
instead
teaching
him
to
to
music
oh
the
crimes
that
are
committed
against
music
in
american
parlors
i
prefer
the
good
mechanical
cabinet
that
offers
us
canned
music
to
the
manual
exercise
of
people
who
insist
on
playing
wherever
they
see
an
open
piano
of
course
the
mechanical
instrument
is
new
and
therefore
subject
to
much
criticism
from
a
decorative
standpoint
but
the
music
is
much
better
than
the
amateur
we
are
still
turning
up
our
noses
a
little
at
the
mechanical
piano
players
but
if
we
will
use
our
common
sense
we
must
admit
that
a
new
order
of
things
has
come
to
pass
and
the
new
canned
music
is
not
to
be
despised
certainly
if
the
instrument
displeases
you
you
can
say
so
but
if
a
misguided
friend
elects
to
strum
on
your
piano
you
are
helpless
so
i
have
no
piano
in
my
new
york
house
i
have
a
cabinet
of
canned
music
that
can
be
turned
on
for
small
dances
when
need
be
and
that
can
be
hidden
in
a
closet
between
times
why
not
but
suppose
you
have
a
piano
or
need
one
do
give
it
a
chance
its
very
size
makes
it
tremendously
important
and
if
you
load
it
with
senseless
fringed
scarfs
and
you
make
it
the
ugliest
thing
in
your
room
give
it
the
best
place
possible
against
an
inside
wall
preferably
i
saw
a
new
house
lately
where
the
placing
of
the
piano
had
been
considered
by
the
architect
when
the
house
was
planned
there
was
a
mezzanine
floor
overhanging
the
great
and
one
end
of
this
had
been
made
into
a
piano
alcove
a
sort
of
modern
minstrel
gallery
the
musician
who
used
the
piano
was
very
happy
for
your
real
musician
loves
a
certain
solitude
and
those
of
us
who
listened
to
his
music
in
the
great
room
below
were
happy
because
the
maker
of
the
music
was
far
enough
away
from
us
we
could
appreciate
the
music
and
forget
the
mechanics
of
it
for
a
concert
or
a
small
dance
this
balcony
would
be
most
convenient
another
good
place
for
the
piano
is
a
sort
of
alcove
or
small
room
opening
from
the
large
living
or
where
the
piano
and
a
few
chairs
may
be
placed
of
course
if
you
are
to
have
a
real
then
there
are
great
possibilities
a
piano
may
be
a
princely
thing
properly
built
and
decorated
the
old
spinets
and
harpsichords
with
their
charming
inlaid
cases
were
beautiful
but
they
gave
forth
only
tinkly
sounds
now
we
have
a
magnificent
mechanism
but
the
case
which
encloses
it
is
too
often
hideous
there
is
an
old
harpsichord
of
the
early
eighteenth
century
in
the
morgan
collection
at
the
metropolitan
museum
that
would
be
a
fine
form
for
a
piano
if
it
would
hold
the
works
it
is
long
and
narrow
fitting
against
the
wall
so
that
it
really
takes
up
very
little
room
the
case
is
painted
a
soft
dark
gray
and
outlined
in
darker
gray
and
the
panels
and
the
long
top
are
in
soft
colors
the
legs
are
carved
and
pointed
in
polychrome
this
harpsichord
was
made
when
the
beauty
of
an
object
was
of
as
real
importance
as
the
mechanical
perfection
occasionally
one
sees
a
modern
piano
that
has
been
decorated
by
an
artist
sir
edward
sir
alma
tadema
and
many
of
the
other
english
artists
of
our
generation
have
made
beautiful
pianos
sir
robert
lorimer
recently
designed
a
piano
that
was
decorated
inside
and
out
by
traquair
from
time
to
time
a
great
artist
interests
himself
in
designing
and
decorating
a
piano
but
the
rank
and
file
when
they
decide
to
build
an
extraordinary
piano
achieve
lumpy
masses
of
wood
covered
with
impossible
nymphs
and
flowers
pianos
suggestive
of
thin
and
sentimental
tunes
but
never
of
when
you
are
furnishing
your
or
be
careful
always
of
your
colors
remember
that
not
only
must
the
room
be
beautiful
in
its
broad
spaces
and
long
lines
and
soft
colors
but
it
must
be
a
background
for
the
gala
gowns
of
women
i
once
saw
a
that
was
deliberately
planned
as
a
background
to
the
gay
colors
of
women
gowns
and
the
heavy
black
masses
of
men
evening
clothes
a
soft
shimmering
green
and
cream
room
that
was
incomplete
and
cold
when
empty
of
the
color
of
costume
such
a
room
must
have
an
architectural
flavor
the
keynote
must
be
elegant
simplicity
and
aristocratic
reserve
walls
broken
into
panels
and
panels
in
turn
broken
by
a
polished
floor
a
ceiling
any
number
of
chairs
and
the
room
is
furnished
this
room
indeed
may
evolve
into
a
xi
the
the
shut
your
eyes
a
minute
and
think
what
that
means
a
room
to
in
suited
to
all
human
needs
to
be
sick
or
sorry
or
glad
in
as
the
day
happenings
may
be
where
one
may
come
back
from
ways
for
east
or
west
hame
best
listen
a
minute
while
i
tell
you
how
i
see
such
a
room
big
and
restful
making
for
comfort
first
and
always
a
little
shabby
here
and
there
perhaps
but
all
the
more
satisfactory
for
that
like
an
old
shoe
that
goes
on
easily
lots
of
light
by
night
and
not
too
much
drapery
to
shut
out
the
sunlight
by
day
big
welcoming
chairs
rather
sprawly
and
long
sofas
a
big
fire
blazing
on
the
open
hearth
perhaps
if
we
are
very
lucky
we
may
have
some
old
logs
from
long
since
foundered
ships
that
will
flame
blue
and
rose
and
green
he
must
indeed
be
of
a
poor
spirit
who
can
not
call
all
sorts
of
visions
from
such
a
flame
illustration
the
in
the
harkness
house
at
morristown
new
jersey
there
should
be
a
certain
amount
of
order
because
you
can
not
really
rest
in
a
disorderly
place
but
there
should
be
none
of
the
formality
of
the
formality
should
be
used
as
a
sort
of
foundation
on
which
the
pleasant
workaday
business
of
the
is
planned
the
should
always
have
a
flavor
of
the
main
hobby
of
the
family
whether
it
be
books
or
music
or
sport
or
what
not
if
you
live
in
the
real
country
there
should
be
nothing
in
the
room
too
good
for
all
moods
and
all
weather
no
need
to
think
of
muddy
boots
or
wet
or
the
dogs
that
have
run
through
the
dripping
fields
i
wonder
if
half
the
fathers
and
mothers
in
creation
know
just
what
it
means
later
on
to
the
boys
and
girls
going
out
from
their
to
have
the
memory
of
such
a
a
may
be
a
simple
place
used
for
all
the
purposes
of
living
or
it
may
be
merely
an
official
for
family
moods
one
of
a
dozen
other
living
apartments
the
in
the
modern
bungalow
for
instance
is
often
library
hall
filling
all
the
needs
of
the
family
while
in
a
large
country
or
city
house
there
may
be
the
central
family
room
and
ever
so
many
little
rooms
that
grow
out
of
the
overflow
needs
the
the
tea
room
that
is
also
sun
and
breakfast
room
the
and
the
library
in
more
elaborate
houses
there
are
also
the
great
hall
the
formal
and
and
the
intimate
boudoir
to
all
these
should
be
given
a
goodly
measure
of
comfort
whether
it
be
one
or
a
dozen
rooms
the
spirit
of
it
must
be
the
same
it
must
offer
comfort
order
and
beauty
to
be
worth
living
in
just
as
when
a
large
family
is
to
be
considered
i
believe
in
one
big
and
a
number
of
smaller
rooms
for
special
purposes
so
i
believe
that
when
a
family
is
very
small
there
should
be
one
great
and
no
other
day
room
two
young
people
who
purpose
to
live
in
a
small
cottage
or
a
bungalow
will
be
wise
to
have
this
one
big
room
that
will
serve
for
and
all
the
same
house
divided
into
a
number
of
tiny
rooms
would
suffocate
them
there
would
be
no
in
furnishing
such
a
room
it
is
well
to
beware
of
of
things
of
six
chairs
of
the
conventional
and
china
closet
i
advocate
the
use
of
a
long
table
four
by
seven
feet
is
not
too
long
and
a
number
of
good
chairs
that
are
alike
in
style
but
not
alike
the
chairs
should
not
be
the
conventional
the
idea
that
the
only
chair
possible
is
a
perfectly
straight
up
and
down
chair
is
absurd
in
a
large
house
where
there
is
a
family
the
chairs
should
be
alike
but
in
an
informal
the
chairs
may
be
perfectly
comfortable
and
useful
between
meals
and
serve
the
purposes
of
chairs
when
necessary
for
instance
with
a
long
oak
table
built
on
the
lines
of
the
old
english
refectory
tables
you
might
have
a
long
bench
of
oak
and
cane
a
large
high
back
chair
with
arms
of
the
stuart
order
that
is
with
graceful
turned
legs
carved
frame
work
and
cane
insets
two
cromwellian
chairs
covered
in
some
good
stuff
and
two
or
three
straight
chairs
of
a
simple
type
these
chairs
may
be
used
for
various
purposes
between
meals
and
will
not
give
the
room
the
stiff
and
formal
air
that
chairs
invariably
produce
one
could
imagine
this
table
drawn
up
to
a
with
bench
and
chairs
beside
it
and
a
dozen
cheerful
people
around
it
there
will
be
little
chance
of
stiffness
at
such
a
it
should
be
remembered
that
when
a
part
of
the
is
used
for
meals
the
things
that
suggest
dining
should
be
kept
out
of
sight
between
meals
all
the
china
and
so
forth
should
be
kept
in
the
pantry
or
in
kitchen
cupboards
the
table
may
be
left
bare
between
meals
in
a
room
of
this
kind
the
furniture
should
be
kept
close
to
the
walls
leaving
all
the
space
possible
for
moving
around
in
the
center
of
the
room
the
book
shelves
should
be
flat
against
the
wall
there
should
be
a
desk
not
too
clumsy
in
build
near
the
book
shelves
or
at
right
angles
to
some
window
there
should
be
a
sofa
of
some
kind
near
the
fireplace
with
a
small
table
at
the
head
of
it
which
may
be
used
for
tea
or
books
or
what
not
if
there
is
a
piano
it
should
be
very
carefully
placed
so
that
it
will
not
dominate
the
room
and
so
that
the
people
who
will
listen
to
the
music
may
gather
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
room
of
course
a
of
this
kind
is
the
jolliest
place
in
the
world
when
things
go
smoothly
but
there
are
times
when
a
little
room
is
a
very
necessary
place
to
retreat
this
little
room
may
be
the
study
library
or
a
tea
room
but
it
is
worth
while
sacrificing
your
smallest
bedroom
in
order
to
have
one
small
place
of
retreat
if
you
can
have
a
number
of
you
can
follow
more
definite
schemes
of
decoration
if
you
have
a
little
enclosed
piazza
you
can
make
a
breakfast
room
or
a
trellis
room
of
it
or
by
bringing
in
many
shelves
and
filling
them
with
flowers
you
can
make
the
place
a
delightful
little
flower
box
of
a
room
for
tea
and
talk
of
course
if
you
live
in
the
real
country
you
will
be
able
to
use
your
garden
and
your
verandas
as
additional
with
a
big
the
one
indoor
may
become
a
quiet
library
for
instance
but
if
you
have
a
garden
or
a
you
should
do
all
in
your
power
to
bring
the
sunshine
and
gaiety
into
the
and
take
your
books
and
quiet
elsewhere
a
library
eight
by
ten
feet
with
shelves
all
the
way
around
and
up
and
down
and
two
comfortable
chairs
and
one
or
two
windows
will
be
a
most
satisfactory
library
if
the
room
is
to
be
used
for
reading
smallness
does
matter
you
see
we
americans
love
books
popular
books
and
we
have
had
sense
enough
to
bring
them
into
our
and
enjoy
them
but
when
you
begin
calling
a
room
a
library
it
should
mean
something
more
than
a
small
mahogany
bookcase
with
a
hundred
volumes
hidden
behind
glass
doors
i
think
there
is
nothing
more
amusing
than
the
unused
library
of
the
the
pretentious
room
with
its
monumental
bookcases
and
its
slick
area
of
glass
doors
and
its
thousands
of
unread
volumes
caged
eternally
in
their
indecent
newness
some
day
when
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
visit
the
book
shops
of
some
department
store
and
then
visit
a
dusky
old
second
hand
shop
and
you
will
see
what
books
can
do
in
the
shop
they
are
leathern
covered
things
gaudy
and
snobbish
in
their
newness
in
the
old
book
shop
they
are
books
that
have
lived
books
that
invite
you
to
browse
you
rather
have
them
with
all
their
germs
and
dust
than
the
soulless
tomes
of
uncut
pages
you
can
judge
people
pretty
well
by
their
books
and
the
wear
and
tear
of
them
open
shelves
are
good
enough
for
any
house
in
these
days
of
vacuum
cleaners
in
the
bayard
thayer
house
i
had
the
pleasure
of
furnishing
a
wonderful
library
of
superb
paneled
walls
of
mahogany
of
a
velvety
softness
not
the
bright
red
wood
of
commerce
the
open
bookshelves
were
architecturally
planned
they
filled
shallow
recesses
in
the
wall
and
when
the
books
were
placed
upon
them
they
formed
a
glowing
tapestry
of
bindings
flush
with
the
main
wall
i
think
the
nicest
i
know
is
the
reading
room
of
the
colony
club
i
never
enjoyed
making
a
room
more
and
when
the
club
was
first
opened
i
was
delighted
to
hear
one
woman
remark
to
another
does
it
make
you
feel
that
it
has
been
loved
and
lived
in
for
years
the
room
is
large
and
almost
square
the
walls
are
paneled
in
cream
and
white
with
the
classic
mantel
and
mirror
treatment
of
the
adam
period
the
large
carpet
rug
is
of
one
tone
a
soft
green
blue
the
bookcases
which
run
around
the
walls
are
of
mahogany
as
are
the
small
occasional
tables
and
the
large
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
in
this
room
i
have
successfully
exploded
the
old
theory
that
all
furniture
in
a
well
planned
room
must
be
of
the
same
kind
in
this
room
there
are
several
marlborough
chairs
a
davenport
and
a
fireside
seat
upholstered
in
a
soft
green
leather
several
chairs
covered
in
a
chintz
of
bird
and
blossom
design
and
other
chairs
covered
with
old
english
the
effect
is
not
discord
but
harmony
perhaps
it
is
not
wise
to
advise
the
use
of
many
colors
and
fabrics
unless
one
has
had
experience
in
the
combining
of
many
tones
and
hues
but
if
you
are
careful
to
keep
your
walls
and
floors
in
subdued
tones
you
may
have
great
license
in
the
selecting
of
hangings
and
chair
coverings
and
ornament
i
gave
great
attention
to
the
details
of
this
room
under
the
simple
mantel
shelf
there
is
inset
a
small
panel
of
blue
and
white
wedgwood
on
the
mantel
there
are
two
jars
of
chinese
porcelain
and
between
them
a
bronze
jardiniere
of
the
adam
period
four
figures
holding
a
shallow
oblong
tray
which
is
filled
with
flowers
the
lamp
on
the
is
made
of
a
hawthorn
jar
with
a
flaring
shade
there
are
many
low
tables
scattered
through
the
room
and
beside
every
chair
is
a
easily
adjusted
to
any
angle
the
fireplace
fittings
are
simple
old
brasses
of
the
colonial
period
there
is
only
one
picture
in
this
room
and
that
is
the
portrait
of
a
long
gone
lady
framed
in
a
carved
gilt
frame
and
hung
against
the
huge
which
is
opposite
the
fireplace
end
of
the
room
i
believe
given
plenty
of
light
and
air
that
comfortable
chairs
and
good
tables
go
further
toward
making
a
comfortable
than
anything
else
in
the
harkness
you
will
see
this
theory
proven
there
are
chairs
and
tables
of
all
sizes
from
the
great
sofas
to
the
little
footstools
from
the
huge
italian
tables
to
the
little
table
especially
made
to
hold
a
few
flower
pots
wherever
there
is
a
large
table
there
is
a
long
sofa
or
a
few
big
chairs
wherever
there
is
a
lone
chair
there
is
a
small
table
to
hold
a
or
flowers
or
what
not
the
great
size
of
the
room
the
fine
english
ceiling
of
modeled
plaster
the
generous
fireplace
with
its
paneled
the
groups
of
windows
all
these
architectural
details
go
far
toward
making
the
room
a
success
the
comfortable
chairs
and
sofas
and
the
ever
useful
tables
do
the
rest
so
many
people
ask
me
how
shall
i
furnish
my
what
paper
shall
i
use
on
the
walls
what
woodwork
and
curtains
and
rugs
one
woman
asked
me
what
books
she
should
buy
your
should
grow
out
of
the
needs
of
your
daily
life
there
could
be
no
two
exactly
alike
in
scheme
if
they
were
lived
in
you
will
have
to
decide
on
the
wall
colors
and
such
things
it
is
true
but
the
rest
of
the
room
should
grow
of
itself
you
will
not
make
the
mistake
of
using
a
dark
paper
of
heavy
figures
if
you
are
going
to
use
many
pictures
and
books
for
instance
you
will
not
use
a
gay
paper
covered
with
flowers
and
birds
you
will
know
without
being
told
that
your
wall
colors
must
be
neutral
that
your
woodwork
must
be
stained
and
waxed
or
painted
some
soft
tone
of
your
wall
color
then
let
the
rugs
and
curtains
and
things
go
until
you
decide
you
have
to
have
them
the
room
will
gradually
find
itself
though
it
may
take
years
and
heartache
and
a
certain
of
inadequacy
it
will
express
your
life
if
you
use
it
so
be
careful
of
the
life
you
live
in
it
xii
and
boudoir
in
some
strange
way
the
word
has
lost
its
proper
significance
people
generally
think
of
it
as
a
highfalutin
name
for
the
bedroom
or
for
a
whereas
really
a
proper
is
the
small
personal
of
a
woman
of
many
interests
it
began
in
old
france
as
the
private
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
a
part
of
the
bedroom
suite
and
it
has
evolved
into
a
sort
of
office
where
the
house
mistress
spends
her
precious
mornings
plans
the
routine
of
her
household
for
the
day
writes
her
letters
interviews
her
servants
and
so
forth
the
boudoir
has
a
certain
suggestion
of
intimacy
because
it
is
a
personal
and
not
a
general
room
but
while
it
may
be
used
as
a
occasionally
it
is
also
a
thoroughly
dignified
room
where
a
woman
may
receive
her
chosen
friends
when
she
pleases
nothing
more
ridiculous
has
ever
happened
than
the
vogue
of
the
boudoir
cap
which
is
really
suited
only
to
one
bedroom
or
such
misnomers
lead
to
a
mistaken
idea
of
the
real
meaning
of
the
word
some
of
the
eighteenth
century
boudoirs
were
extremely
small
i
recall
one
charming
little
room
in
an
old
french
house
that
was
barely
eight
feet
by
eleven
but
it
contained
a
fireplace
two
windows
a
day
bed
one
of
those
graceful
desks
known
as
a
du
and
two
an
extremely
symmetrical
arrangement
of
the
room
gave
a
sense
of
order
and
order
always
suggests
space
one
wall
was
broken
by
the
fireplace
the
wall
spaces
on
each
side
of
it
being
paneled
with
narrow
moldings
the
space
above
the
mantel
was
filled
with
a
mirror
on
the
wall
opposite
the
fireplace
there
was
a
broad
paneling
of
the
same
width
filled
with
a
mirror
from
baseboard
to
ceiling
in
front
of
this
mirror
was
placed
the
charming
desk
on
each
side
of
the
long
mirror
were
two
windows
exactly
opposite
the
two
long
panels
of
the
mantel
wall
the
two
narrow
end
walls
were
treated
as
single
panels
the
day
bed
being
placed
flat
against
one
of
them
while
the
other
was
broken
by
a
door
which
led
to
a
little
old
gilt
appliques
holding
candles
flanked
both
mantel
mirror
and
desk
mirror
two
of
those
graceful
chairs
of
the
louis
seize
period
and
a
small
footstool
completed
the
furnishing
of
this
room
illustration
miss

louis

boudoir
the
boudoir
should
always
be
a
small
room
because
in
no
other
way
can
you
gain
a
sense
of
intimacy
here
you
may
have
all
the
luxury
and
elegance
you
like
you
may
stick
to
white
paint
and
simple
chintzes
or
you
may
indulge
your
passion
for
silks
and
lace
frills
here
of
all
places
you
have
a
right
to
express
your
sense
of
luxury
and
comfort
the
boudoir
furnishings
are
borrowed
from
both
bedroom
and
traditions
there
are
certain
things
that
are
used
in
the
bedroom
that
would
be
ridiculous
in
the
and
yet
are
quite
at
home
in
the
boudoir
for
instance
the
is
part
of
the
bedroom
furnishing
in
most
modern
houses
and
it
may
also
be
used
in
the
boudoir
but
in
the
it
would
be
a
violation
of
good
taste
because
the
suggestion
of
intimacy
is
too
evident
nothing
is
more
comfortable
in
a
boudoir
than
a
day
bed
it
serves
so
many
purposes
in
my
own
house
my
boudoir
is
also
my
and
i
have
a
large
louis
xv
day
bed
there
which
may
be
used
by
an
overnight
guest
if
necessary
in
a
small
house
the
boudoir
fitted
with
a
day
bed
becomes
a
on
occasion
i
always
put
two
or
three
of
these
day
beds
in
any
country
house
i
am
doing
because
i
have
found
them
so
admirable
and
useful
in
my
own
house
as
you
will
see
by
the
photographs
this
bed
in
no
way
resembles
an
ordinary
bed
in
the
daytime
and
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
much
better
solution
of
the
problem
than
the
mechanical
which
is
always
hideous
and
usually
dangerous
a
good
day
bed
may
be
designed
to
fit
into
any
room
this
one
of
mine
is
of
carved
walnut
a
very
graceful
one
that
i
found
in
france
in
a
small
in
an
uptown
house
an
illustration
of
which
is
shown
i
had
a
day
bed
made
of
white
wood
that
was
painted
to
match
the
chintzes
of
the
room
the
mattress
and
springs
were
covered
with
a
bird
chintz
on
a
mauve
ground
and
the
pillows
were
all
covered
with
the
same
stuff
the
frame
of
the
bed
was
painted
cream
and
decorated
with
a
dull
green
line
and
small
garlands
of
flowers
extracted
from
the
design
of
the
chintz
when
the
mattress
and
springs
have
been
properly
covered
with
damask
or
chintz
or
whatever
you
choose
to
use
there
is
no
suggestion
of
the
ordinary
bed
i
suppose
there
is
a
more
charming
room
in
new
york
than
miss
anne
morgan
louis
xvi
boudoir
the
everyday
of
a
woman
of
many
interests
it
is
radiant
with
color
and
individuality
as
rare
rugs
are
radiant
as
jewels
are
radiant
the
cream
walls
with
their
carved
moldings
and
graceful
panelings
are
a
pleasant
background
for
all
this
shimmering
color
the
carvings
and
moldings
are
pointed
in
blue
the
floor
is
covered
with
a
persian
rug
which
glows
with
all
the
soft
tones
of
the
old
persian
the
day
bed
a
few
of
the
chairs
and
the
chest
of
drawers
are
of
a
soft
brown
walnut
there
are
other
chairs
covered
with
louis
xvi
tapestries
brocade
and
needlework
quite
in
harmony
with
the
modern
chintz
of
the
day
bed
and
the
hangings
above
the
day
bed
there
is
a
portrait
of
a
lady
hung
by
wires
covered
with
shirred
blue
ribbons
and
this
blue
is
again
used
in
an
old
porcelain
lamp
jar
on
the
bedside
table
the
whole
room
might
have
been
inspired
by
the
lady
of
the
portrait
so
essentially
is
it
the
room
of
a
fastidious
woman
but
to
go
back
to
my
own
boudoir
it
is
really
library
and
combined
a
home
room
very
much
like
my
office
in
the
conveniences
it
offers
in
the
early
morning
it
is
my
office
where
i
plan
the
day
routine
and
consult
my
servants
in
the
rare
evenings
when
i
may
give
myself
up
to
solid
comfort
and
a
new
book
it
becomes
a
haven
of
refuge
after
the
business
of
the
day
when
i
choose
to
work
at
home
with
my
secretary
it
is
as
a
place
as
my
office
it
is
a
sort
of
room
of
all
trades
and
good
for
each
of
them
the
walls
of
the
room
are
pretty
well
filled
with
bookshelves
windows
and
doors
but
there
is
one
long
wall
space
for
the
day
bed
and
another
for
the
old
secretary
that
holds
my
porcelain
figurines
the
room
is
really
quite
small
but
by
making
the
furniture
keep
its
place
against
the
walls
an
effect
of
spaciousness
has
been
obtained
the
walls
of
the
room
are
painted
the
palest
of
the
woodwork
is
ivory
white
with
applied
decorations
of
sculptured
white
marble
the
floor
is
entirely
covered
with
a
carpet
rug
of
jade
green
velvet
and
there
is
a
smaller
persian
rug
of
the
soft
indescribable
colors
of
the
orient
the
day
bed
of
which
i
spoke
in
an
earlier
paragraph
is
covered
with
an
old
brocade
figures
on
a
black
ground
a
large
armchair
is
also
covered
with
the
brocade
and
the
window
curtains
which
can
not
be
seen
in
the
picture
are
of
black
chintz
printed
with
birds
of
pale
greens
and
blues
and
grays
with
beaks
of
there
is
always
a
possibility
for
in
my
rooms
i
love
it
so
i
manage
the
other
colors
so
that
they
will
admit
a
chair
or
a
stool
or
a
bowl
of
rose
color
in
this
room
the
two
chairs
beside
the
couch
are
covered
with
damask
and
this
brings
out
the
rose
in
the
rug
and
in
the
chintz
and
accents
the
deep
red
note
of
the
leathern
the
rose
red
is
subordinated
to
the
importance
of
the
in
this
room
but
there
is
still
opportunity
for
its
use
in
so
many
small
things
in
this
room
you
will
notice
i
have
used
open
shelves
for
my
books
and
the
old
secretary
which
was
once
a
combination
desk
and
bookcase
is
used
for
the
display
of
my
little
treasures
of
porcelain
and
china
and
its
drawers
are
used
for
papers
and
prints
the
built
in
shelves
have
cupboards
beneath
them
for
the
flimsy
papers
and
pamphlets
that
do
not
belong
on
open
shelves
if
the
same
room
were
pressed
into
service
as
a
guest
room
i
should
use
the
drawers
in
the
secretary
instead
of
the
usual
chest
of
drawers
and
the
day
bed
for
sleeping
illustration
miss
morgan
louis
xvi
de
the
is
placed
at
right
angles
to
one
of
the
panels
between
the
front
windows
i
have
used
a
in
this
room
because
i
like
tables
better
than
heavy
desks
and
because
in
this
small
apartment
a
desk
would
seem
heavy
and
ponderous
the
fittings
of
the
desk
are
of
dark
red
leather
like
that
of
many
of
the
and
the
personal
touch
that
makes
the
desk
is
a
bowl
of
roses
between
the
two
windows
in
the
shallow
recess
i
have
placed
an
aquarium
a
recent
acquisition
that
delights
my
soul
the
aquarium
is
simply
an
oblong
glass
box
mounted
on
a
teak
stand
with
a
tracery
of
teak
carving
outlining
the
box
which
is
the
home
of
the
most
gorgeous
goldfish
there
are
water
plants
in
the
box
too
and
funny
little
chinese
temples
and
dwarf
trees
i
love
to
house
my
little
people
happily
my
dogs
and
my
birds
and
my
fish
wee
toi
my
little
chinese
dog
has
a
little
house
all
his
own
an
old
chinese
lacquer
box
with
a
canopy
top
and
little
gold
bells
it
was
once
the
shrine
of
some
little
chinese
god
i
suppose
but
wee
toi
is
very
happy
in
it
and
you
can
see
that
it
was
meant
for
him
in
the
beginning
it
sits
by
the
fireplace
and
gives
the
room
an
air
of
real
hominess
i
was
so
pleased
with
the
aquarium
and
the
chinese
lacquer
bed
for
wee
toi
that
i
devised
a
birdcage
to
go
with
them
a
square
cage
of
gilt
wires
with
a
black
lacquer
pointed
canopy
top
with
little
gilt
bells
at
the
pointed
eaves
the
cage
is
fixed
to
a
shallow
lacquer
tray
and
is
the
nicest
place
you
can
imagine
for
a
whistling
bullfinch
to
live
in
i
suppose
i
could
have
a
persian
cat
on
a
gorgeous
cushion
to
complete
the
place
but
i
ca
admit
cats
into
the
room
i
plan
gorgeous
cushions
for
people
little
people
when
they
happen
to
be
cats
miss
marbury
is
on
the
next
floor
exactly
like
mine
architecturally
but
we
have
worked
them
out
differently
i
think
there
is
nothing
more
interesting
than
the
study
of
the
different
developments
of
a
series
of
similar
rooms
for
instance
a
dozen
twelve
stories
deep
in
a
modern
apartment
house
each
room
is
left
by
the
builder
with
the
same
arrangement
of
doors
and
windows
the
same
wall
spaces
and
moldings
the
same
opportunity
for
good
or
bad
development
it
is
often
our
luck
to
see
all
twelve
of
the
rooms
but
sometimes
we
see
three
or
four
of
them
and
how
amazingly
different
they
are
how
amusing
is
the
suggestion
of
personality
or
lack
of
it
now
in
these
two
in
our
house
the
rooms
are
exactly
the
same
in
size
in
exposure
in
the
placing
of
doors
and
windows
and
fireplaces
and
we
have
further
paralleled
our
arrangement
by
placing
our
day
beds
in
the
same
wall
space
but
there
the
similarity
ends
miss
marbury
color
plan
is
different
her
walls
are
a
soft
gray
the
floor
is
covered
in
a
solid
blue
carpet
rug
rather
dark
in
tone
the
chintz
also
has
a
black
ground
but
the
pattern
is
entirely
different
in
character
from
the
room
below
there
is
a
day
bed
similar
to
mine
but
where
my
bed
has
been
upholstered
with
brocade
miss
marbury
has
a
loose
slip
cover
of
black
chintz
the
spaces
between
the
windows
in
my
room
are
filled
with
bookshelves
and
in
miss
marbury
room
the
same
spaces
are
filled
with
mirrors
the
large
that
is
background
to
my
old
secretary
is
in
her
room
given
up
to
long
open
bookshelves
of
mahogany
my
is
mirrored
and
hers
is
filled
with
an
old
painting
the
recessed
spaces
on
each
side
of
the
chimney
breast
hold
small
tables
of
marquetry
with
a
pair
of
long
adam
mirrors
hanging
above
them
another
adam
mirror
hangs
above
the
bookshelves
on
the
opposite
wall
these
mirrors
are
really
the
most
important
things
in
the
room
because
the
moldings
and
and
picture
frames
have
been
made
to
harmonize
with
them
the
are
of
wood
carved
in
the
adam
manner
and
painted
dark
blue
and
gold
the
has
been
placed
squarely
in
front
of
the
center
window
in
which
are
hung
miss
marbury
bird
cages
there
are
a
number
of
old
french
prints
on
the
wall
the
whole
room
is
quieter
in
tone
than
my
room
which
may
be
because
her
chosen
color
is
and
mine
in
a
small
house
where
only
one
woman
tastes
have
to
be
considered
a
small
downstairs
may
take
the
place
of
the
more
personal
boudoir
but
where
there
are
a
number
of
people
in
the
household
a
room
connecting
with
the
bedroom
of
the
house
mistress
is
more
fortunate
here
she
can
be
as
independent
as
she
pleases
of
the
family
and
the
guests
who
come
and
go
through
the
other
of
the
house
here
she
can
have
her
counsels
with
her
children
or
her
tradespeople
or
her
employees
without
the
distractions
of
chance
interruptions
for
this
one
room
should
have
doors
that
open
close
doors
that
are
not
to
be
approached
without
invitation
the
room
may
be
as
austere
and
as
a
office
or
it
may
be
a
nest
of
comfort
and
luxury
primarily
planned
for
relaxation
but
it
must
be
so
placed
that
it
is
a
little
apart
from
the
noise
and
flurry
of
the
rest
of
the
house
or
it
has
no
real
whenever
it
is
possible
i
believe
the
man
of
the
house
should
also
have
a
small
that
corresponds
to
his
wife
boudoir
we
americans
have
made
a
violent
attempt
to
incorporate
a
room
of
this
kind
in
our
houses
by
introducing
a
den
or
a
study
but
somehow
the
man
of
the
house
is
never
keen
about
such
a
room
a
den
to
him
means
an
airless
of
a
room
hung
with
draperies
and
shields
and
weapons
and
he
has
a
mighty
aversion
to
it
who
could
blame
him
and
as
for
the
study
the
average
man
does
want
a
study
when
he
wants
to
work
he
prefers
to
work
in
his
office
and
he
like
a
room
of
his
own
big
enough
to
hold
all
his
junk
and
like
it
to
have
doors
and
windows
and
a
fireplace
the
study
is
usually
a
heavy
cheerless
little
room
that
is
any
good
for
anything
else
the
ideal
arrangement
would
be
a
room
of
average
size
opening
from
his
bedroom
a
room
that
would
have
little
suggestion
of
business
and
a
great
flavor
of
his
hobbies
his
wife
boudoir
must
be
her
office
also
but
he
does
need
a
house
office
unless
he
be
a
writer
or
a
teacher
or
some
man
who
works
at
home
after
all
i
think
the
painters
and
illustrators
are
the
happiest
of
all
men
because
they
to
have
studios
and
their
wives
generally
recognize
the
fact
and
give
them
a
free
hand
the
man
who
has
a
studio
or
a
workshop
all
his
own
is
always
a
popular
man
he
has
a
fascination
for
his
less
fortunate
friends
who
buzz
around
him
in
wistful
admiration
xiii
a
light
gay
first
of
all
i
think
a
should
be
light
and
gay
the
first
thing
to
be
considered
is
plenty
of
sunshine
the
next
thing
is
the
planning
of
a
becoming
background
for
the
mistress
of
the
house
the
room
should
always
be
gay
and
charming
in
color
but
the
color
should
be
selected
with
due
consideration
of
its
becomingness
to
the
hostess
every
woman
has
a
right
to
be
pretty
in
her
own
i
do
not
favor
the
dark
heavy
treatments
and
elaborate
stuff
hangings
which
seem
to
represent
the
taste
of
most
of
the
men
who
go
in
for
decorating
nowadays
nine
times
out
of
ten
the
seems
to
be
the
gloomiest
room
in
the
house
i
think
it
should
be
a
place
where
the
family
may
meet
in
gaiety
of
spirit
for
a
pause
in
the
vexatious
happenings
of
the
day
i
think
light
tones
gay
wallpapers
flowers
and
sunshine
are
of
more
importance
than
storied
tapestries
and
heavily
carved
furniture
these
things
are
all
very
well
for
the
house
that
has
a
small
and
a
gala
for
formal
occasions
as
well
but
there
are
few
such
houses
we
new
yorkers
have
been
so
accustomed
to
the
gloomy
basement
of
the
conventional
houses
of
the
late
eighties
we
forgot
how
nice
a
can
be
even
though
the
city
is
now
more
fortunately
placed
in
the
rear
of
the
second
floor
it
is
usually
overshadowed
by
other
houses
and
can
be
lightened
only
by
skilful
use
of
color
in
curtains
china
and
so
forth
therefore
i
think
this
is
the
one
room
in
the
city
house
where
one
can
afford
to
use
a
boldly
decorative
paper
i
like
very
much
the
chinese
with
their
broad
sketchy
decorations
of
birds
and
flowers
these
papers
are
never
tiresomely
realistic
and
are
always
done
in
very
soft
colors
or
in
soft
shades
of
one
color
and
while
if
you
analyze
them
they
are
very
fantastic
the
general
effect
is
as
restful
as
it
is
cheerful
you
know
you
can
be
most
cheerful
when
you
are
most
rested
the
quaint
landscape
papers
which
are
seen
in
so
many
new
england
seem
to
belong
with
american
colonial
furniture
and
white
woodwork
prim
silver
and
gold
banded
china
these
landscape
papers
are
usually
gay
in
effect
and
make
for
cheer
there
are
many
new
designs
less
complicated
than
the
old
ones
then
too
there
are
charming
foliage
papers
made
up
of
leaves
and
branches
and
birds
which
are
very
good
while
we
may
find
color
and
cheer
in
these
gay
papers
for
gloomy
city
if
we
have
plenty
of
light
we
may
get
more
distinguished
results
with
paneled
walls
a
large
may
be
paneled
with
dark
wood
with
a
painted
fresco
or
tapestry
frieze
and
a
ceiling
with
carved
or
painted
beams
or
perhaps
one
of
those
interesting
ceilings
with
plaster
beams
judiciously
adorned
with
ornament
in
low
relief
given
a
large
and
a
little
money
you
can
do
anything
you
can
make
a
room
that
will
compare
favorably
with
the
traditional
rooms
on
which
we
build
you
have
a
right
to
make
your
as
fine
as
you
please
so
long
as
you
give
it
its
measure
of
light
and
air
but
one
thing
you
must
have
simplicity
it
may
be
the
simplicity
of
a
marble
floor
and
tapestried
walls
and
a
painted
ceiling
it
may
be
the
simplicity
of
white
paint
and
muslin
and
fine
furniture
but
simplicity
it
must
have
the
furniture
that
is
required
in
a
declares
itself
a
table
and
chairs
you
can
bring
side
tables
and
china
closets
into
it
or
you
can
build
in
cupboards
and
consoles
to
take
their
place
but
there
is
little
chance
for
other
variation
and
so
the
beginning
is
a
declaration
of
order
and
simplicity
illustration
a
georgian
in
the
william
iselin
house
the
easiest
way
to
destroy
this
simplicity
is
to
litter
the
room
with
displays
of
silver
and
glass
to
dot
the
walls
with
indifferent
pictures
if
you
are
courageous
enough
to
let
your
walls
take
care
of
themselves
and
to
put
away
your
silver
and
china
and
glass
the
room
will
be
as
dignified
as
you
could
wish
remember
that
simplicity
depends
on
balance
and
space
if
the
walls
balance
one
another
in
light
and
shadow
if
the
furniture
is
placed
formally
if
walls
and
furniture
are
free
from
mistaken
ornament
the
room
will
be
serene
and
beautiful
in
most
other
rooms
we
avoid
the
pairing
of
things
but
here
pairs
and
sets
of
things
are
most
desirable
two
console
tables
are
more
impressive
than
one
there
is
great
decorative
value
in
a
pair
of
mirrors
a
pair
of
candlesticks
a
pair
of
porcelain
jars
two
cupboards
flanking
a
you
would
not
be
guilty
of
a
pair
of
wall
fountains
or
of
two
wall
clocks
just
as
you
would
not
have
two
copies
of
the
same
portrait
in
a
room
but
when
things
pair
logically
pair
them
they
will
furnish
a
backbone
of
precision
to
the
room
the
in
the
iselin
house
is
a
fine
example
of
stately
simplicity
it
is
extremely
formal
and
yet
there
is
about
it
none
of
the
gloominess
one
associates
with
new
york
the
severely
paneled
walls
the
fine
with
an
old
master
inset
and
framed
by
a
grinling
gibbons
carving
the
absence
of
the
usual
mantel
shelf
the
plain
and
the
fine
old
lion
chairs
all
go
to
make
up
a
georgian
room
of
great
distinction
the
woman
who
can
not
afford
such
expensive
simplicity
might
model
a
on
this
same
plan
and
accomplish
a
beautiful
room
at
reasonable
expense
paneled
walls
are
always
possible
if
you
afford
wood
paneling
paint
the
plastered
wall
white
or
cream
and
break
it
into
panels
by
using
a
narrow
molding
of
wood
you
can
get
an
effect
of
great
dignity
by
the
use
of
molding
at
a
few
cents
a
foot
a
large
panel
would
take
the
place
of
the
grinling
gibbons
carving
and
a
mirror
might
be
inset
above
the
fireplace
instead
of
the
portrait
the
and
chairs
might
give
place
to
good
reproductions
of
chippendale
and
the
marble
console
to
a
one
painted
to
match
the
woodwork
the
subject
of
proper
furniture
for
a
is
usually
settled
by
the
house
mistress
before
her
wedding
bouquet
has
faded
so
i
shall
only
touch
on
the
things
here
everyone
knows
that
a
table
and
a
certain
number
of
chairs
and
a
sideboard
of
some
kind
go
together
the
trouble
is
that
everyone
knows
these
things
well
and
conventions
are
so
binding
that
we
miss
many
pleasant
departures
from
the
usual
my
own
in
new
york
is
anything
but
usual
and
yet
there
is
nothing
undignified
about
it
the
room
was
practically
square
so
that
it
had
a
certain
orderly
quality
to
begin
with
the
rooms
of
the
house
are
all
rather
small
and
so
to
gain
the
greatest
possible
space
i
have
the
door
openings
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
wall
leaving
as
large
a
wall
space
as
possible
you
enter
this
room
then
through
a
door
at
the
extreme
left
of
the
south
wall
of
the
room
another
door
at
the
extreme
right
of
the
same
wall
leads
to
a
private
passage
the
space
left
between
the
doors
is
thereby
conserved
and
is
broken
into
a
large
central
panel
flanked
by
two
narrow
panels
the
space
above
the
doors
is
also
paneled
this
wall
is
broken
by
a
console
placed
under
the
central
panel
above
it
one
of
the
mennoyer
originals
which
you
may
remember
in
the
washington
irving
is
set
in
the
wall
framed
with
a
narrow
molding
of
gray
the
walls
and
woodwork
of
the
room
are
of
exactly
the
same
tone
of
gray
darker
than
a
silver
gray
and
lighter
than
pewter
everything
color
balance
proportion
objects
of
art
has
been
uniformly
considered
continuing
the
east
wall
is
broken
in
the
center
by
the
fireplace
with
a
mantel
of
white
and
gray
marble
a
large
mirror
surmounted
with
a
in
black
and
white
fills
the
space
between
mantel
shelf
and
cornice
this
mirror
and
are
framed
with
the
narrow
carved
molding
painted
gray
here
again
there
is
the
beauty
of
balance
two
italian
candlesticks
of
carved
and
gilded
wood
flank
a
marble
bust
on
the
mantel
shelf
there
is
nothing
more
on
the
right
of
the
mirror
in
a
narrow
panel
there
is
a
wall
clock
of
carved
and
gilded
wood
which
also
takes
its
place
as
a
part
of
the
wall
and
keeps
it
the
north
wall
is
broken
by
two
mirrors
and
a
door
leading
to
the
a
large
screen
made
of
an
uncut
tapestry
shuts
off
the
door
we
need
all
the
light
the
windows
give
so
there
are
no
curtains
except
the
taffeta
valances
at
the
top
i
devised
sliding
doors
of
mirrors
that
are
pulled
out
of
the
wall
at
night
to
fill
the
recessed
space
of
the
windows
ventilation
is
afforded
by
the
open
fireplace
and
by
mechanical
means
you
see
we
do
not
occupy
this
house
in
summer
so
the
mirrored
windows
are
quite
feasible
the
fourth
wall
has
no
openings
and
it
is
broken
into
three
large
paneled
spaces
a
console
has
the
place
of
honor
opposite
the
fireplace
and
above
it
there
is
a
mirror
like
that
over
the
mantel
in
the
two
side
panels
are
the
two
large
mennoyers
there
are
five
of
these
in
the
room
the
smaller
ones
flanking
the
chimney
piece
you
see
that
the
salvation
of
this
room
depends
on
this
careful
repetition
and
variation
of
similar
objects
color
is
brought
into
the
room
in
the
blue
and
yellow
of
the
chinese
rug
in
the
chairs
and
in
the
painted
table
the
chairs
are
painted
a
creamy
yellow
pointed
with
blue
and
upholstered
with
blue
and
yellow
striped
velvet
i
do
not
like
chairs
in
a
their
one
claim
to
use
is
that
they
make
a
becoming
background
but
this
does
not
compensate
for
the
difficulties
of
the
service
when
they
are
used
an
awkward
servant
pouring
soup
down
one
back
is
not
an
aid
to
digestion
or
to
the
peace
of
mind
engendered
by
a
good
dinner
illustration
ogden

james

lane
painted
the
painted
table
is
very
unusual
the
legs
and
the
carved
are
painted
cream
and
pointed
with
blue
like
the
chairs
but
the
top
is
as
gay
as
an
garden
with
stiff
little
medallions
and
urns
spilling
over
with
flowers
and
conventional
blossoms
picked
out
all
over
it
the
colors
used
are
very
soft
blue
and
cream
being
predominant
the
table
is
covered
with
a
sheet
of
plate
glass
this
table
is
of
course
too
elaborate
for
a
simple
but
the
idea
could
be
adapted
and
varied
to
suit
many
color
and
furniture
schemes
painted
furniture
is
a
delight
in
a
small
in
the
colony
club
i
planned
a
very
small
room
for
little
dinners
that
is
well
worth
reproducing
in
a
small
house
this
little
room
was
very
hard
to
manage
because
there
were
no
windows
there
were
two
tiny
little
openings
high
on
the
wall
at
one
end
of
the
room
but
it
would
take
imagination
to
call
them
windows
the
room
was
on
the
top
floor
and
the
real
light
came
from
a
skylight
you
can
imagine
the
difficulty
of
making
such
a
little
box
interesting
however
there
was
one
thing
that
warmed
my
heart
to
the
little
room
a
tiny
between
the
hall
proper
and
the
room
proper
this
little
i
paneled
in
yellowish
tan
and
gray
i
introduced
a
sofa
covered
with
an
old
brocade
just
the
color
of
dried
rose
leaves
ashes
of
roses
the
french
call
it
and
the
little
became
a
fitting
introduction
to
the
within
the
walls
of
the
rooms
were
paneled
in
a
delicious
color
between
yellow
and
tan
the
wall
proper
and
the
moldings
being
this
color
and
the
panels
themselves
filled
with
a
gray
paper
painted
in
pinky
yellows
and
browns
these
panels
were
done
by
hand
by
a
man
who
found
his
inspiration
in
the
painted
panels
of
an
old
french
ballroom
as
the
walls
were
unbroken
by
windows
there
was
ample
space
for
such
decoration
a
carpet
of
rose
color
was
chosen
and
the
skylight
was
curtained
with
shirred
silk
of
the
same
rose
the
table
and
chairs
were
of
painted
wood
the
chairs
having
seats
of
the
brocade
used
on
the
sofa
the
table
was
covered
with
rose
colored
brocade
and
over
this
cobwebby
lace
and
over
this
plate
glass
there
are
two
consoles
in
the
room
with
small
cabinets
above
which
hold
certain
in
keeping
with
the
room
under
the
two
tiny
windows
were
those
terrible
snags
we
decorators
always
strike
the
radiators
wrongly
placed
they
are
capable
of
spoiling
any
room
i
concealed
these
radiators
by
building
two
small
cabinets
with
panels
of
iron
framework
gilded
to
suggest
a
graceful
metal
lattice
and
lined
them
with
silk
i
borrowed
this
idea
from
a
fascinating
cabinet
in
an
old
french
palace
and
the
result
is
worth
the
deception
the
cabinets
are
nice
in
themselves
and
they
do
not
interfere
with
the
radiation
of
the
heat
i
have
seen
many
charming
country
houses
and
farm
houses
in
france
with
furnished
with
painted
furniture
somehow
they
make
the
average
american
seem
very
commonplace
and
tiresome
for
instance
i
had
the
pleasure
of
furnishing
a
little
country
house
in
france
and
we
planned
the
in
blue
and
white
the
furniture
was
of
the
simplest
painted
white
with
a
dark
blue
line
for
decoration
the
corner
cupboard
was
a
little
more
elaborate
with
a
gracefully
curved
top
and
a
large
glass
door
made
up
of
little
panes
set
in
a
quaint
design
there
were
several
drawers
and
a
lower
cupboard
the
drawers
and
the
lower
doors
invited
decorations
a
little
more
elaborate
than
the
blue
lines
of
the
furniture
so
we
painted
on
gay
little
medallions
in
soft
tones
of
blue
from
the
palest
to
a
very
dark
blue
the
chair
cushions
were
blue
and
the
china
was
blue
sprigged
three
little
pitchers
of
luster
were
on
the
wall
cupboard
shelf
and
a
mirror
in
a
faded
gold
frame
gave
the
necessary
variation
of
tone
a
very
charming
treatment
for
either
a
country
or
small
city
is
to
have
corner
cupboards
of
this
kind
cutting
off
two
corners
they
are
convenient
and
unusual
and
pretty
as
well
they
can
be
painted
in
white
with
a
colored
line
defining
the
panels
and
can
be
made
highly
decorative
if
the
panels
are
painted
with
a
classic
or
a
chinese
design
the
decoration
however
should
be
kept
in
variations
of
the
same
tone
as
the
stripe
on
the
panels
for
instance
if
the
stripe
is
gray
then
the
design
should
be
in
dark
and
light
gray
and
blue
tones
the
chairs
can
be
white
in
a
room
of
this
kind
with
small
gray
and
blue
medallions
and
either
blue
and
white
or
plain
blue
cushions
another
of
the
same
sort
was
planned
for
a
small
country
house
on
long
island
here
the
woodwork
was
a
deep
cream
the
walls
the
same
tone
and
the
ceiling
a
little
lighter
we
found
six
of
those
prim
duxbury
chairs
with
flaring
and
painted
them
a
soft
the
table
was
a
plain
pine
one
with
straight
legs
we
painted
it
cream
and
decorated
the
top
with
a
conventional
border
of
green
adapted
from
the
design
of
the
china
a
thick
creamy
danish
ware
ornamented
with
queer
little
wavy
lines
and
figures
i
should
have
mentioned
the
china
first
because
the
whole
room
grew
from
that
the
rug
was
a
square
of
velvet
of
a
darker
green
the
curtains
were
soft
net
one
wall
was
made
up
of
windows
another
of
doors
and
a
cupboard
and
against
the
other
two
walls
we
built
two
long
narrow
consoles
that
were
so
simple
anyone
could
accomplish
them
simply
two
wide
shelves
resting
on
good
brackets
with
mirrors
above
the
one
splendid
thing
in
the
room
was
a
curtain
of
soft
green
damask
that
was
pulled
at
night
to
cover
the
group
of
windows
everything
else
in
the
room
was
bought
for
a
song
illustration
the
private
in
the
colony
club
i
have
said
much
of
cupboards
and
consoles
because
i
think
they
are
so
much
better
than
the
awkward
heavy
china
closets
and
buffets
and
sideboards
that
dominate
most
the
time
has
come
when
we
should
begin
to
do
fine
things
in
the
way
of
building
fitment
furniture
that
is
furniture
that
is
actually
or
apparently
a
part
of
the
shell
of
the
room
it
would
be
so
much
better
to
build
a
house
slowly
planning
the
furniture
as
a
part
of
the
architectural
detail
with
each
succeeding
year
the
house
would
become
more
and
more
a
part
of
the
owner
illustrating
his
life
of
course
this
would
mean
that
the
person
who
planned
the
developing
of
the
house
must
have
a
certain
architectural
training
must
know
about
scale
and
proportion
and
something
of
general
construction
certainly
charming
things
are
to
be
created
in
this
way
things
that
will
last
things
immeasurably
preferable
to
the
cheap
furniture
which
so
soon
becomes
shabby
which
has
to
be
so
constantly
renewed
people
accept
new
ideas
with
great
difficulty
and
my
only
hope
is
that
they
may
grow
to
accept
the
idea
of
fitment
furniture
through
finding
the
idea
a
product
of
their
own
a
personal
discovery
that
comes
from
their
own
needs
i
have
constantly
recommended
the
use
of
our
native
american
woods
for
panelings
and
wall
furniture
because
we
have
both
the
beautiful
woods
of
our
new
world
and
tried
and
proven
furniture
of
the
old
world
and
what
could
we
achieve
with
such
material
available
why
do
people
think
of
a
cupboard
as
being
less
important
than
a
detached
piece
of
furniture
is
it
a
braggart
pose
a
desire
to
show
the
number
of
things
you
can
buy
of
course
it
is
a
very
foolish
pose
but
it
is
a
popular
one
this
display
of
objects
that
are
expensive
it
is
very
easy
to
build
cupboards
on
each
side
of
a
fireplace
for
instance
making
the
wall
flush
with
the
this
is
always
good
architectural
form
one
side
could
have
a
desk
which
opens
beneath
the
glass
doors
and
the
other
could
have
cupboards
both
presenting
exactly
the
same
appearance
when
closed
fitted
corner
cupboards
triangular
or
rounded
are
also
excellent
in
certain
dining
rooms
wall
tables
or
consoles
may
be
of
the
same
wood
as
the
woodwork
or
of
marble
or
of
some
dark
polished
wood
there
are
no
more
useful
pieces
of
furniture
than
consoles
and
yet
we
only
see
them
in
great
houses
why
because
they
are
simple
and
we
have
yet
learned
to
demand
the
simple
i
have
had
many
interesting
old
of
wrought
iron
support
and
marble
tops
copied
and
i
have
designed
others
that
were
mere
of
white
painted
wood
supported
by
four
slender
legs
but
whether
they
be
marble
or
pine
the
effect
is
always
simple
there
are
charming
consoles
that
have
come
to
us
from
the
eighteenth
century
consoles
made
in
pairs
so
that
they
may
stand
against
the
wall
as
or
be
placed
together
to
form
one
round
table
this
is
a
very
good
arrangement
where
people
have
one
large
living
room
or
hall
in
which
they
dine
and
which
also
serves
all
the
purpose
of
daily
intercourse
this
entirely
removes
any
suggestion
of
a
as
the
consoles
may
be
separated
and
stand
against
the
wall
during
the
day
many
modern
houses
are
being
built
without
the
conventional
we
have
known
so
long
there
being
instead
an
breakfast
room
which
may
be
glazed
in
winter
and
screened
in
summer
people
have
come
to
their
senses
at
last
and
realize
that
there
is
nothing
so
pleasant
as
eating
outdoors
the
annual
migration
of
americans
to
europe
is
responsible
for
the
introduction
of
this
excellent
custom
french
houses
are
always
equipped
with
some
outdoor
place
for
eating
some
of
them
have
in
addition
to
the
inclosed
porch
a
fascinating
pavilion
built
in
the
garden
where
breakfast
and
tea
may
be
served
modern
mechanical
conveniences
and
the
inexpensive
electric
apparatus
make
it
possible
to
serve
meals
at
this
distance
from
the
house
and
keep
them
hot
in
the
meantime
one
may
prepare
one
own
coffee
and
toast
at
table
with
the
green
trees
and
flowers
and
birds
all
around
eating
outdoors
makes
for
good
health
and
long
life
and
good
temper
everyone
knows
that
the
simplest
meal
seems
a
gala
affair
when
everyone
is
radiant
and
cheerful
whereas
a
long
and
elaborate
meal
served
indoors
is
usually
depressing
xiv
the
bedroom
in
olden
times
people
rarely
slept
in
their
bedrooms
which
were
mostly
de
where
everyone
was
received
and
much
business
was
transacted
the
real
bedroom
was
usually
a
smallish
closet
nearby
these
de
were
very
splendid
the
beds
raised
on
a
dais
and
hung
with
fine
damasks
and
tapestries
tapestries
thick
with
bullion
fringes
the
horror
of
fresh
air
felt
by
our
ancestors
was
well
illustrated
here
no
draughts
from
windows
or
badly
hung
doors
could
reach
the
sleeper
in
such
a
bed
illustration
an
old
painted
bed
of
the
louis
xvi
period
this
was
certainly
different
from
our
modern
ideas
of
hygiene
in
those
days
furniture
that
could
not
be
hastily
moved
was
of
little
importance
the
bed
was
usually
a
mere
frame
of
wood
made
to
be
covered
with
valuable
hangings
which
could
easily
be
packed
and
carried
away
on
occasions
that
too
often
arose
in
the
troublous
days
of
the
early
middle
ages
the
benches
and
tables
one
sees
in
many
foreign
palaces
are
covered
with
gorgeous
lengths
of
velvet
and
brocade
this
is
a
survival
of
the
custom
when
furniture
was
merely
so
much
baggage
with
the
early
eighteenth
century
however
there
came
into
being
petits
in
which
the
larger
space
formerly
accorded
the
bedroom
was
divided
into
salon
or
and
the
bedroom
very
often
the
bed
was
placed
in
an
alcove
and
the
heavy
brocades
and
bullion
embroideries
were
replaced
by
linen
or
cotton
hangings
when
oberkampf
established
himself
at
jouy
in
france
took
first
place
in
the
production
of
these
printed
linens
and
cottons
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
age
of
chintz
and
of
the
delightful
decorative
fabrics
that
are
so
suited
to
our
modern
ideas
of
hygiene
it
seems
to
me
there
are
no
more
charming
stuffs
for
bedroom
hangings
than
these
simple
fabrics
with
their
enchantingly
fanciful
designs
think
of
the
changes
one
could
have
with
several
sets
of
curtains
to
be
changed
at
will
as
marie
antoinette
used
to
do
at
the
petit
trianon
how
amusing
it
would
be
in
our
own
modern
houses
to
change
the
bed
coverings
window
curtains
and
so
forth
twice
or
three
times
a
year
i
like
these
loose
slip
covers
and
curtains
better
than
the
usual
hard
upholstery
because
if
properly
planned
the
slips
can
be
washed
without
losing
their
color
or
their
lines
charming
eighteenth
century
prints
that
are
full
of
valuable
hints
as
to
furniture
and
decorations
for
bedrooms
can
be
found
in
most
french
shops
the
series
known
as
le
is
full
of
suggestion
some
of
the
interiors
shown
are
very
grand
it
is
true
but
many
are
simple
enough
to
serve
as
models
for
modern
apartments
a
set
of
these
pictures
will
do
much
to
give
one
an
insight
into
the
decoration
of
the
eighteenth
century
a
vivid
insight
that
can
be
obtained
in
no
other
way
perhaps
i
do
not
like
the
very
large
bedrooms
dear
to
the
plans
of
the
american
architect
i
much
prefer
the
space
divided
i
remember
once
arriving
at
the
ritz
hotel
in
london
and
being
given
temporarily
a
very
grand
royal
suite
overlooking
the
park
until
the
smaller
quarters
i
had
reserved
should
be
ready
for
me
how
delighted
i
was
at
first
with
all
the
huge
vastness
of
my
bedroom
my
appreciation
waned
however
after
a
despairing
morning
toilet
spent
in
taking
many
steps
back
and
forth
from
to
bathroom
and
from
bathroom
to
and
i
was
glad
indeed
when
at
the
end
of
several
hours
i
was
comfortably
housed
in
my
smaller
and
humbler
quarters
i
think
the
ideal
bedroom
should
be
planned
so
that
a
small
should
separate
it
from
the
large
outside
corridor
the
ideal
arrangement
is
an
opening
on
the
boudoir
or
then
the
bedroom
with
its
and
bath
in
back
this
outer
chamber
insures
quiet
and
privacy
no
matter
how
small
it
may
be
it
may
serve
as
a
by
filling
the
wall
with
cupboards
and
concealing
them
with
mirrored
doors
the
need
not
be
a
luxury
if
you
plan
your
house
carefully
it
is
simply
a
little
well
of
silence
and
privacy
between
you
and
the
hall
outside
illustration
miss

louis

bed
to
go
on
with
my
ideal
bedroom
the
walls
i
think
should
be
simply
paneled
in
wood
painted
gray
or
cream
or
white
but
if
wood
can
not
be
afforded
a
plastered
wall
painted
or
distempered
in
some
soft
tone
is
the
best
solution
you
will
find
plain
walls
and
gay
chintz
hangings
very
much
more
satisfying
than
walls
covered
with
flowered
papers
and
plain
hangings
for
the
simple
reason
that
a
design
repeated
hundreds
of
times
on
a
wall
surface
becomes
very
very
tiresome
but
the
same
design
in
a
fabric
is
softened
and
broken
by
the
folds
of
the
material
and
you
will
never
get
the
annoying
sense
of
being
impelled
to
count
the
figures
one
of
the
bedrooms
illustrated
in
this
book
shows
an
elizabethan
paper
that
does
not
belong
to
the
busy
class
for
while
the
design
is
decorative
in
the
extreme
you
are
not
aware
of
an
emphatic
repeat
this
is
really
an
old
chintz
design
and
is
very
charming
in
blues
and
greens
and
grays
on
a
cream
ground
i
have
seen
bedrooms
papered
with
huge
scrolls
and
sea
shells
many
times
enlarged
that
suggest
the
noisy
and
methodical
thumping
of
a
drum
i
can
not
imagine
anyone
sleeping
calmly
in
such
a
room
this
bedroom
is
eminently
suited
to
the
needs
of
a
man
the
hangings
are
of
a
plain
soft
stuff
accenting
one
of
the
deep
tones
of
the
wall
covering
and
the
sash
curtains
are
of
white
muslin
the
furniture
is
of
oak
of
the
jacobean
period
the
bed
is
true
to
its
inspiration
with
turned
legs
and
runners
and
slatted
head
and
foot
boards
the
legs
and
runners
of
the
bed
were
really
inspired
by
the
chairs
and
tables
of
the
period
this
is
an
excellent
illustration
of
the
modern
furniture
that
may
be
adapted
from
old
models
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
beds
of
that
period
were
huge
cumbersome
affairs
and
this
adapted
bed
is
really
more
suitable
to
modern
needs
in
size
and
weight
and
line
than
an
original
one
there
are
so
many
inspirations
for
bedrooms
nowadays
that
one
finds
it
most
difficult
to
decide
on
any
one
scheme
one
of
my
greatest
joys
in
planning
the
colony
club
was
that
i
had
opportunity
to
furnish
so
many
bedrooms
and
they
were
small
pleasant
rooms
too
not
the
usual
impersonal
boxes
that
are
usually
planned
for
club
houses
and
hotels
i
worked
out
the
plan
of
each
bedroom
as
if
i
were
to
live
in
it
myself
and
while
they
all
differed
in
decorative
schemes
the
essentials
were
the
same
in
each
room
a
comfortable
bed
with
a
small
table
beside
it
to
hold
a
reading
light
a
clock
and
a
telephone
a
for
resting
a
long
mirror
somewhere
a
dressing
table
with
proper
lights
and
a
glass
covered
top
a
writing
table
carefully
equipped
and
the
necessary
chairs
and
stools
some
of
the
bedrooms
had
no
connecting
baths
and
these
were
given
wash
stands
with
bowls
and
pitchers
of
clear
glass
most
of
these
bedrooms
were
fitted
with
mahogany
four
post
beds
pie
crust
tables
colonial
highboys
gay
chintzes
and
such
but
there
were
several
rooms
of
entirely
different
scheme
illustration
a
colony
club
bedroom
perhaps
the
most
fascinating
of
them
all
is
the
bird
room
the
walls
are
covered
with
an
oriental
paper
patterned
with
marvelous
blue
and
green
birds
birds
of
paradise
and
paroquets
perched
on
flowering
branches
the
black
lacquer
furniture
was
especially
designed
for
the
room
the
rug
and
the
hangings
are
of
jade
green
i
wonder
how
this
seems
to
read
of
i
can
only
say
it
is
a
very
gay
and
happy
room
to
live
in
there
is
another
bedroom
in
pink
and
white
which
would
be
an
adorable
room
for
a
young
girl
the
bed
is
of
my
own
design
a
simple
white
painted
metal
bed
there
is
a
upholstered
in
the
pink
and
white
striped
chintz
of
the
room
the
same
chintz
is
used
for
window
hangings
bed
spread
and
so
forth
there
is
a
little
spindle
legged
table
of
mahogany
and
another
table
at
the
head
of
the
bed
which
contains
the
reading
light
there
is
also
a
little
white
stool
with
a
cushion
of
the
chintz
beside
the
bed
the
is
so
simple
that
any
girl
might
copy
it
it
is
a
box
with
a
sheet
of
plate
glass
on
top
and
a
white
framed
mirror
hung
above
it
the
electric
lights
in
this
room
are
cleverly
made
into
candlesticks

are

was
another

these
bedrooms
were
equipped
with
rugs
of
neutral

harmonious
tone
the
were
always
painted
to
harmonize
with
the
chintzes

the
furniture
wherever
possible
there
was
an
open
fireplace
roomy
clothes

added
much
to
the

nothing
so
nice
has
happened
in
a
long
time
as
the
revival
of
painted
furniture
and
the
application
of
quaint
designs
to
modern
beds

chairs
and
chests
you
may
find
inspiration
in
a
length
of
chintz

an
old
fan

anywhere
the
main
thing
is
to
work
out
a
color
plan
for
the
background
the
walls
the
furniture
and
the
rugs
and
then
you
can
draw
or
stencil
the
chosen
designs
wherever
they
seem
to
belong
and
paint
them
in
with
dull
tones
and
soft
colors
rose

buff

blue

green
and
a
little
bit
of
gray

cream

if

rooms
shown
in

illustrations
the
posy
garlands
on
the
chest
of
drawers
were
inspired
by
a
lamp
jar
this
furniture
was
carefully
planned
as
may
be
seen
by
the
little
urns
on
the
bedposts
quite
in
the
manner
of
the
brothers
adam
but
delightful
results
may
be
obtained
by
using
any
simple
modern
cottage
furniture
and
applying
fanciful
decorations
be
wary
of
hanging
many
pictures
in
your
bedroom
i
give
this
advice
cheerfully
because
i
know
you
will
hang
them
anyway
i
do
but
i
warn
you
you
will
spoil
your
room
if
you
are
very
stern
with
yourself
somehow
the
pictures
we
most
love
small
prints
and
photographs
and
things
look
spotty
on
our
walls
we
must
group
them
to
get
a
pleasant
effect
keep
the
framed
photographs
on
the
writing
table
the
dressing
table
the
mantel
but
do
not
hang
them
on
your
walls
if
you
have
small
prints
that
you
feel
you
must
have
hang
them
flat
on
the
wall
well
within
the
line
of
vision
they
should
be
low
enough
to
be
because
usually
such
pictures
are
not
decorative
in
effect
but
exquisite
in
detail
the
fewer
pictures
the
better
and
in
the
fewer
still
i
planned
a
for
the
top
floor
of
a
new
york
house
that
is
very
successful
the
room
was
built
around
a
pair
of
appliques
made
from
two
old
chinese
sprays
of
metal
flowers
i
had
small
electric
light
bulbs
fitted
among
the
flowers
mounted
them
on
carved
wood
brackets
on
each
side
of
a
good
mantel
mirror
and
worked
out
the
rest
of
the
room
from
them
the
walls
were
painted
bluish
green
the
woodwork
white
just
below
the
molding
at
the
top
of
the
room
there
was
a
narrow
border
four
inches
wide
of
a
pattern
in
blue
and
green
the
carpet
rug
is
of
a
tone
the
hangings
are
of
an
alluring
chintz
and
there
are
several
chinese
color
prints
framed
and
hanging
in
the
narrow
panels
between
the
front
windows
the
furniture
is
painted
a
deep
cream
pointed
with
blue
and
green
and
the
bed
covering
is
of
a
pale
turquoise
taffeta
another
guest
room
was
done
in
gentian
blue
and
white
with
a
little
buff
and
in
small
things
this
room
was
planned
for
the
guests
of
the
daughter
of
the
house
so
the
furnishings
were
naively
and
adorably
feminine
the
was
made
of
a
long
low
box
with
a
glass
top
and
a
valance
so
crisp
and
flouncing
that
it
suggested
a
young
lady
in
crinoline
the
valance
was
of
chintz
in
gentian
blue
and
white
the
white
mirror
frame
was
decorated
with
little
blue
lines
and
tendrils
surely
any
girl
would
grow
pretty
with
dressing
before
such
an
enchanting
affair
and
simple
why
she
could
hinge
the
mirrors
together
and
make
the
chintz
ruffle
and
enamel
the
shelves
white
and
do
every
bit
of
it
except
cut
the
plate
glass
of
course
the
glass
is
very
clean
and
nice
but
an
enameled
surface
with
a
white
linen
cover
would
be
very
pleasant
the
same
blue
and
white
chintz
was
used
for
the
hangings
and
bed
coverings
everything
else
in
the
room
was
white
except
the
thick
cream
rug
with
its
border
of
blue
and
rose
and
buff
and
the
candlesticks
and
appliques
which
repeated
those
colors

for

frederick

has
a
similar
bed
covered
with
a
chintz
these
great
beds
are
very
beautiful
in
large
rooms
but
they
would
be
out
of
place
in
small
ones
there
are
draped
beds
however
that
may
be
used
in
smaller
rooms
i
am
showing
a
photograph
of
a
bedroom
in
the
crocker
house
in
burlingame
california
where
i
used
a
small
draped
bed
with
charming
effect
this
bed
is
placed
flat
against
the
wall
like
a
sofa
and
the
drapery
is
adapted
from
that
of
a
louis
xvi
room
the
bed
is
of
gray
painted
wood
and
the
hangings
are
of
blue
and
cream
chintz
lined
with
blue
taffetas
i
used
the
same
idea
in
a
rose
and
blue
bedroom
in
a
new
york
house
in
this
case
however
the
bed
was
painted
cream
white
and
the
large
panels
of
the
head
and
foot
boards
were
filled
with
a
rose
and
blue
chintz
the
bedspread
was
of
deep
rose
colored
taffetas
and
from
a
small
canopy
above
the
bed
four
curtains
of
the
rose
and
blue
chintz
lined
with
the
taffetas
are
pulled
to
the
four
corners
of
the
bed
this
novel
arrangement
of
draperies
is
very
satisfactory
in
a
small
room
in
my
own
house
the
bedrooms
open
into
so
much
of
the
usual
furniture
is
not
necessary
my
own
bedroom
for
instance
is
built
around
the
same
old
breton
bed
i
had
in
the
washington
irving
house
the
bed
dominates
the
room
but
there
are
also
a
several
small
tables
many
comfortable
chairs
and
a
real
fireplace
the
business
of
dressing
takes
place
in
the
so
there
is
no
here
but
there
are
long
mirrors
filling
the
wall
spaces
between
windows
and
doors
miss
marbury
bedroom
is
just
over
mine
and
is
a
sunshiny
place
of
much
rose
and
blue
and
cream
her
rooms
are
always
full
of
blue
just
as
my
rooms
are
always
full
of
rose
color
this
bedroom
has
cream
woodwork
and
walls
of
a
cream
painted
furniture
covered
with
a
mellow
sort
of
chintz
and
a
persian
rug
made
up
of
blue

cream
the
curtains
at
the
windows
are
of
plain
blue
linen
bordered
with
a
narrow
blue

white
fringe
the

the
most
beautiful
thing
in

room
is
a
fifteenth
century

which
has
the
place
of
honor
over

mantel
i
have
said
a
word
about
our
nice
american
colonial
bedrooms
because
all
of
you
know
their
beauties
and
requirements
as
well
as
i
the
great
drawback
to
the
stately
old
furniture
of
our
ancestors
is
the
space
it
occupies
have
you
seen
a
fine
old
four
post
bed
simply
overflowing
a
poor
little
room
fortunately
the
are
designing
simple
beds
of
similar
lines
but
lighter
build
and
these
beds
are
very
lovely
the
owner
of
a
massive
old
bed
is
justly
proud
of
it
but
our
new
beds
are
built
for
a
new
service
and
a
new
conception
of
hygiene
and
so
must
find
new
lines
and
curves
that
will
be
friendly
to
the
old
dressing
tables
and
highboys
and
chests
of
drawers
when
we
are
fortunate
enough
to
inherit
great
old
houses
of
course
we
will
give
them
proper
furniture
if
we
can
find
it
i
remember
a
house
in
new
orleans
that
had
a
full
dozen
spacious
bedrooms
square
closetless
chambers
that
opened
into
small
one
of
them
i
remember
was
absolutely
bare
of
wall
and
floor
with
a
great
napoleon
bed
set
squarely
in
the
center
of
it
there
was
the
inevitable
mosquito
net
canopy
here
somehow
endowed
with
an
unexpected
dignity
one
felt
the
room
had
been
made
for
sleeping
and
nothing
sleeping
and
while
the
bed
was
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
to
get
all
the
air
possible
its
placing
was
a
master
stroke
of
decoration
in
that
great
white
walled
room
it
was
as
impressive
as
a
royal
bed
on
a
dais
we
are
getting
more
sensible
about
our
bedrooms
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
for
the
last
ten
years
there
has
been
a
dreadful
epidemic
of
brass
beds
a
mistaken
vogue
that
came
as
a
reaction
from
the
heavy
walnut
beds
of
the
last
generation
white
painted
metal
beds
came
first
and
will
last
always
but
they
were
good
enough
for
people
of
ostentatious
tastes
and
so
the
vulgar
brass
bed
came
to
pass
why
we
should
suffer
brass
beds
in
our
rooms
i
do
know
the
plea
is
that
they
are
more
sanitary
than
wooden
ones
hospitals
must
consider
sanitation
first
last
and
always
and
they
use
white
iron
beds
and
why
should
white
iron
beds
which
are
modest
and
unassuming
in
appearance
serve
for
homes
as
well
the
truth
is
that
the
glitter
of
brass
appeals
to
the
untrained
eye
but
that
is
passing
go
into
the
better
shops
and
you
will
see
recently
there
was
a
spasmodic
outbreak
of
beds
but
i
think
there
wo
be
a
vogue
for
this
newest
object
of
bad
taste
it
is
a
little
too
much
if
your
house
is
clean
and
you
intend
to
keep
it
so
a
wooden
bed
that
has
some
relation
to
the
rest
of
your
furniture
is
the
best
bed
possible
otherwise
a
white
painted
metal
one
there
is
never
an
excuse
for
a
brass
one
indeed
i
think
the
three
most
glaring
errors
we
americans
make
are
lace
curtains
and
brass
beds
illustration
my
own
bedroom
is
built
around
a
breton
bed
xv
the
and
the
bath
and
closets
should
be
necessities
not
luxuries
but
alas
our
architects
ideas
of
the
importance
of
large
bedrooms
have
made
it
almost
impossible
to
incorporate
the
proper
closets
and
a
woman
really
requires
in
the
foregoing
chapter
on
bedrooms
i
advised
the
division
of
a
large
bedroom
into
several
smaller
rooms
and
bath
the
necessary
closets
may
be
built
along
the
walls
of
all
these
little
rooms
or
if
there
is
sufficient
space
one
long
airy
closet
may
serve
for
all
one
personal
belongings
of
course
such
a
suite
of
rooms
is
possible
only
in
large
houses
but
even
in
simple
houses
a
small
can
be
built
into
the
corner
of
an
bedroom
in
france
every
woman
dresses
in
her
de
it
is
one
of
the
most
important
rooms
in
the
house
no
french
woman
would
dream
of
dressing
in
her
the
little
de
need
not
be
much
larger
than
a
closet
if
the
closets
are
built
ceiling
high
and
the
doors
are
utilized
for
mirrors
such
an
arrangement
makes
for
great
comfort
and
privacy
here
i
find
that
most
of
my
countrywomen
dress
in
their
bedrooms
i
infinitely
prefer
the
separate
which
means
a
change
of
air
and
which
can
be
thoroughly
ventilated
if
one
sleeps
with
the
bedroom
windows
wide
open
it
is
a
pleasure
to
have
a
warm
to
step
into
i
think
the
first
thing
to
be
considered
about
a
is
its
utility
here
no
particular
scheme
of
decoration
or
of
color
is
in
place
everything
should
be
very
simple
very
clean
and
very
hygienic
the
floors
should
not
be
of
wood
but
may
be
of
marble
or
mosaic
cement
or
clean
white
tiles
with
a
possible
touch
of
color
if
the
is
bathroom
also
there
should
be
as
large
a
bath
as
is
compatible
with
the
size
of
the
room
the
combination
of
and
bathroom
is
successful
only
in
those
large
houses
where
each
bedroom
has
its
bath
i
have
seen
such
rooms
in
modern
american
houses
that
were
quite
as
large
as
bedrooms
with
the
supreme
luxury
of
open
fireplaces
think
of
the
comfort
of
having
one
bath
and
of
making
one
toilet
before
an
open
fire
this
is
an
outgrowth
of
our
passion
for
bedrooms
that
are
so
they
become
and
we
may
leave
their
chill
air
for
the
comfortable
warmth

in
as
few
words
as
possible
i
should
say
put
in
lots
of
mirrors
and
then
more
mirrors
and
then
more
indeed
i
do
not
think
one
can
have
too
many
mirrors
in
a
long
mirrors
can
be
set
in
doors
and
wall
panels

that
one
may

self

boots
hinged
mirrors
are
lovely

for
the
tops

have
made
so
many
of
them

gold
lacquer
was
made
to
be
used
on
a
plain
green
enameled
placed
squarely
in
the
recess
of
a
great
window
i
also
use
small
mirrors
of
graceful
contour
to
light
up
the
dark
corners
of
have
your
mirrors
so
arranged
that
you
get
a
good
strong
light
by
day
and
have
plenty
of
electric
lights
all
around

for
night
use
in
other
words
know
the
worst
before
you
go
out
in
my
own
the
lights
are
arranged
just
as
i
used
to
have
them
long
ago
in
my
theater
when
i
was
on
the
stage
i
can
see
myself
back
front

sides
before
i
go
out
really
it
is
a
comfort
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
your
own

i
lay
great
stress
on
the
mirrors
and
plenty
of
lights
and
yet
more
lights
oh
the
joy
the
blessing
of
electric
light
i
think
every
woman
would
like
to
dress
always
by
a
blaze
of
electric
light
and
be
seen
only
in
the
soft
luminosity
of
candle
light
how
lovely
we
would
all
look
to
be
sure
it
is
a
great
thing
to
know
the
worst
before
one
goes
out
so
that
even
the
terrors
of
the
arc
lights
before
our
theaters
will
be
powerless
to
dismay
us

there
is
room

should
be
a

suggested
a

nothing

you
may

little
coverlet
for
your
own
sofa
whether
it
be
in
your
bedroom
your
boudoir
or
your
that
will
be
quite
as
useful
as
this
delectable
i
saw
some
amusing
ones
recently
made
of
gay
austrian
silks
lined
with
astonishing
colors
and
bound
with
puffings
and
flutings
of
ribbon
of
still
other
colors
a
coverlet
of
this
kind
would
be
as
good
as
a
trip
away
from
home
for
the
woman
who
is
bored
and
wearied
no
matter
how
drab
and
commonplace
her
house
might
be
she
could
devise
a
gay
quilt
of
one
of
the
enchanting
new
stuffs
and
wrap
herself
in
it
for
a
holiday
hour
one
of
the
most
amusing
ones
was
of
turquoise
blue
silk
with
stiff
flowers
of
violet
and
sulphur
yellow
scattered
over
it
the
flowers
were
quite
large
and
far
apart
so
that
there
was
a
square
expanse
of
the
turquoise
blue
with
a
stiff
flower
at
each
corner
the
lining
was
of
sulphur
yellow
silk
and
the
binding
was
a
puffing
of
violet
ribbons
the
color
fairly
made
me
gasp
at
first
but
then
it
became
fascinating
and
finally
irresistible
i
sighed
as
i
thought
of
the
dreary
patchwork
quilts
of
our
how
they
would
have
marveled
at
our
audacious
use
of
color
our
frank
joy
in
it
of
course
the
most
important
thing
in
the
is
the
i
place
my
a
group
of
windows
not
near
them
whenever
it
is
possible
i
have
used
plate
glass
tops
on
many
of
them
and
mirrors
for
tops
on
others
for
you
ca
have
too
many
mirrors
or
too
strong
a
light
for
dressing
we
must
see
ourselves
as
others
will
see
us
my
own
contains
many
drawers
one
of
which
is
fitted
with
an
a
tray
for
pens
and
pencils
and
a
sliding
shelf
on
which
i
write
this
obviates
going
into
another
room
to
answer
hurried
notes
when
one
is
dressing
beside
the
stands
the
tall
for
the
hat
i
may
be
wearing
that
day
when
the
maid
prepares
the
dress
that
is
to
be
worn
she
puts
the
hat
that
goes
with
the
toilette
on
the
tall
single
stand
another
idea
is
the
little
hollow
table
on
casters
that
can
easily
be
slipped
under
the
where
it
is
out
of
the
way
all
the
little
ugly
things
that
make
one
lovely
can
be
kept
in
this
table
which
can
have
a
lid
if
desired
and
even
a
lock
and
key
i
frequently
make
them
with
a
glass
bottom
as
they
do
not
get
stained
or
soiled
and
can
be
washed
there
are
lots
of
little
dodges
that
spell
comfort
for
the
of
the
woman
who
wants
comfort
and
can
have
luxury
there
is
the
which
is
connected
with
the
system
of
the
house
and
which
heats
the
towels
and
incidentally
the
this
a
boon
if
you
like
a
hot
bath
sheet
after
a
cold
plunge
on
a
winter
morning
another
modern
luxury
is
a
wall
cabinet
fitted
with
glass
shelves
for
one
bottles
and
sponges
and
powders
there
seems
to
be
no
end
to
the
little
luxuries
that
are
devised
for
the
woman
who
makes
a
proper
toilet
who
can
blame
her
for
loving
the
business
of
making
herself
attractive
when
every
one
offers
her
encouragement
a
closet
is
absolutely
necessary
in
the
and
if
space
is
precious
every
inch
of
its
interior
may
be
fitted
with
shelves
and
drawers
and
hooks
so
that
no
space
is
wasted
the
outside
of
the
closet
door
may
be
fitted
with
a
mirror
and
narrow
shelves
just
deep
enough
to
hold
one
bottles
may
be
fitted
on
the
inside
of
the
door
if
the
closet
is
very
shallow
the
inner
shelves
should
be
hollowed
out
to
admit
the
bottle
shelves
when
the
door
is
closed
otherwise
the
bottles
will
be
smashed
the
first
time
a
careless
maid
slams
the
door
this
bottle
closet
has
been
one
of
my
great
successes
in
small
apartments
where
bathroom
and
are
one
and
where
much
must
be
accomplished
in
a
small
space
in
the
more
modern
apartments
the
tub
is
placed
in
a
recess
in
the
wall
of
the
bathroom
leaving
more
space
for
dressing
purposes
this
sort
of
combination
should
have
waterproof
floor
and
wall
and
no
fripperies
there
should
be
a
screen
large
enough
to
conceal
the
tub
and
a
folding
chair
that
may
be
placed
in
the
small
closet
when
it
is
not
in
use
when
the
bathroom
is
too
small
to
admit
a
and
chair
and
the
bedroom
is
quite
large
a
good
plan
is
the
building
of
a
tiny
room
in
one
corner
of
the
bedroom
of
course
this
little
must
have
a
window
i
have
used
this
plan
many
times
with
excellent
results
another
scheme
when
the
problem
was
entirely
different
and
the
was
too
large
for
comfort
was
to
line
three
walls
of
it
with
closets
the
fourth
wall
being
filled
with
windows
these
closets
were
narrow
each
having
a
mirrored
panel
in
its
door
this
is
the
ideal
arrangement
for
there
is
ample
room
for
all
one
gowns
shoes
hats
veils
gloves
each
article
having
its
own
specially
planned
shelf
or
receptacle
the
closets
are
painted
in
gay
colors
inside
and
the
shelves
are
fitted
with
thin
perfumed
pads
they
are
often
further
decorated
with
bright
lines
of
color
which
is
always
amusing
to
the
woman
who
opens
a
door
hat
stands
and
bags
are
covered
with
the
same
chintzes
employed
in
the
proper
certain
of
the
closets
are
fitted
with
the
english
tray
shelves
and
each
tray
has
its
sachet
the
hangers
for
gowns
are
covered
in
the
chintz
or
brocade
used
on
the
hat
stands
this
makes
an
effective
ensemble
whether
brocades
or
printed
cottons
are
used
if
the
arrangement
is
orderly
and
full
of
gay
color
illustration
miss
marbury
one
of
the
most
successful
gown
closets
i
have
done
is
a
long
narrow
closet
with
a
door
at
each
end
really
a
passageway
between
a
bedroom
and
a
boudoir
long
poles
run
the
length
of
the
closet
with
curtains
that
enclose
a
passage
from
door
to
door
back
of
these
curtains
are
long
poles
that
may
be
raised
or
lowered
by
pulleys
each
gown
is
placed
on
its
padded
hanger
covered
with
its
muslin
bag
and
hung
on
the
pole
the
pole
is
then
drawn
up
so
that
the
tails
of
the
gowns
will
not
touch
the
dust
of
the
floor
this
is
a
most
orderly
arrangement
for
the
woman
of
many
gowns
the
straightaway
bathroom
that
one
finds
in
apartments
and
small
houses
is
difficult
to
make
beautiful
but
may
be
made
airy
and
which
is
more
important
i
had
to
make
such
a
bathroom
a
little
more
attractive
recently
and
it
was
a
very
pleasant
job
i
covered
the
walls
with
a
waterproof
stuff
of
white
figured
with
a
small
black
polkadot
the
woodwork
and
the
ceiling
were
painted
white
all
around
the
door
and
window
frames
i
used
a
border
of
ivy
leaves
also
of
waterproof
paper
and
although
i
usually
abominate
borders
i
loved
this
one
a
plain
white
framed
mirror
was
also
painted
with
green
ivy
leaves
and
a
glass
shelf
above
the
wash
bowl
was
fitted
with
glass
bottles
and
dishes
with
labels
and
lines
of
clear
green
white
muslin
curtains
were
hung
at
the
window
and
a
small
white
stool
was
given
a
cushion
covered
with
green
and
white
ivy
patterned
chintz
the
floor
was
painted
white
and
a
solid
green
rug
was
used
the
towels
were
with
the
name
of
the
owner
in
the
same
bright
green
the
room
when
finished
was
cool
and
refreshing
and
had
cost
very
little
in
money
and
not
so
very
much
in
time
and
labor
i
think
that
in
country
houses
where
there
is
not
a
bathroom
with
each
bedroom
there
should
be
a
very
good
washstand
provided
for
each
guest
when
a
house
party
is
in
progress
for
instance
and
every
one
comes
in
from
tennis
or
golf
or
what
not
eager
for
a
bath
and
fresh
clothes
washstands
are
most
convenient
why
should
a
washstand
be
just
as
attractively
furnished
as
a
just
because
they
have
been
so
ugly
we
condemn
them
to
eternal
ugliness
but
it
is
quite
possible
to
make
the
washstand
interesting
to
look
upon
as
well
as
serviceable
it
is
necessary
to
buy
a
set
of
dreadful
crockery
you
can
assemble
the
necessary
things
as
carefully
as
you
would
assemble
the
outfit
for
your
go
to
the
pottery
shops
the
glass
shops
the
silversmiths
and
you
will
find
dozens
of
bowls
and
pitchers
and
small
things
a
clear
glass
bowl
and
pitcher
and
the
necessary
glasses
and
bottles
can
be
purchased
at
any
department
store
the
french
peasants
make
an
pottery
that
is
delightful
for
a
washstand
set
so
many
of
the
china
shops
have
large
shallow
bowls
that
were
made
for
salad
and
punch
and
pitchers
that
were
made
for
the
but
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
be
used
on
the
washstand
i
know
one
wash
basin
that
began
as
a
russian
brass
pan
of
flaring
rim
with
it
is
used
an
old
water
can
of
hammered
brass
and
brass
dishes
glass
lined
to
hold
soaps
and
sponges
it
is
only
necessary
to
desire
the
unusual
thing
and
you
get
it
though
much
searching
may
intervene
between
the
idea
and
its
achievement
the
washstand
itself
is
not
such
a
problem
a
pair
of
may
be
bought
and
one
fitted
up
as
a
washstand
and
the
other
left
to
its
usual
use
in
the
colony
club
there
are
a
number
of
bathrooms
but
there
are
also
washstands
in
those
rooms
that
have
no
private
bath
each
bathroom
has
its
fittings
planned
to
harmonize
with
the
connecting
bedroom
and
the
clear
glass
bottles
are
all
marked
in
the
color
prevailing
in
the
bedroom
each
bathroom
has
a
mirror
and
all
the
conveniences
of
a
bathroom
in
a
private
house
in
addition
to
these
rooms
there
is
a
long
hall
filled
with
small
de
which
some
clever
woman
dubbed
prinkeries
these
are
small
rooms
fitted
with
where
members
may
freshen
their
toilets
for
an
occasion
these
little
prinkeries
would
be
excellent
in
large
country
houses
where
there
are
so
many
motoring
guests
who
come
for
a
few
hours
only
and
only
to
find
that
all
the
bedrooms
and
in
the
house
are
being
used
by
the
family
and
the
house
guests
a
description
of
the
pool
of
the
colony
club
is
hardly
within
the
province
of
this
chapter
but
so
many
amazing
americans
are
building
themselves
great
houses
incorporating
theaters
and
roman
baths
so
many
women
are
building
club
houses
so
many
others
are
building
palatial
houses
that
are
known
as
girls
schools
perhaps
the
will
soon
be
a
part
of
all
large
houses
this
pool
occupies
the
greater
part
of
the
basement
floor
of
the
club
house
the
rest
of
the
floor
being
given
over
to
little
rooms
where
one
may
have
a
shampoo
or
massage
or
a
dancing
lesson
or
what
not
before
or
after
one
swim
the
pool
is
by
sixty
feet
sunken
below
the
level
of
the
marble
floor
the
depth
is
graded
from
four
feet
to
deep
water
so
that
good
and
bad
swimmers
may
enjoy
it
the
marble
margin
of
floor
surrounding
the
pool
is
bordered
with
marble
benches
placed
between
the
white
columns
the
walls
of
the
great
room
are
paneled
with
mirrors
so
that
there
are
endless
reflections
of
columned
corridors
and
pools
and
shimmering
lights
the
ceiling
is
covered
with
a
light
trellis
hung
with
vines
from
which
hang
great
bunches
of
grapes
holding
electric
lights
one
gets
the
impression
of
myriads
of
white
columns
and
of
lights
and
shadows
infinitely
surely
the
old
romans
knew
no
pleasanter
place
than
this
pool
xvi
the
small
apartment
this
is
the
age
of
the
apartment
not
only
in
the
great
cities
but
in
the
smaller
centers
of
civilization
the
apartment
has
come
to
stay
modern
women
demand
simplified
living
and
the
apartment
reduces
the
mechanical
business
of
living
to
its
lowest
terms
a
decade
ago
the
apartment
was
considered
a
sorry
makeshift
in
america
though
it
has
been
successful
abroad
for
more
years
than
you
would
believe
we
americans
have
been
accustomed
to
so
much
space
about
us
that
it
seemed
a
curtailment
of
family
dignity
to
give
up
our
gardens
our
piazzas
and
halls
our
cellars
and
attics
our
front
and
rear
entrances
now
we
are
wiser
we
have
just
so
much
time
so
much
money
and
so
much
strength
and
it
behooves
us
to
make
the
best
of
it
why
should
we
give
our
time
and
strength
and
enthusiasm
to
drudgery
when
our
housework
were
better
and
more
economically
done
by
machinery
and
why
should
we
stultify
our
minds
with
doing
the
same
things
thousands
of
times
over
when
we
might
help
ourselves
and
our
friends
to
happiness
by
intelligent
occupations
and
amusements
the
apartment
is
the
solution
of
the
living
problems
of
the
city
and
it
has
been
a
direct
influence
on
the
houses
of
the
towns
so
simplifying
the
business
of
living
as
well
of
course
many
of
us
who
live
in
apartments
either
have
a
little
house
or
a
big
one
in
the
country
for
the
summer
months
or
we
plan
for
one
some
day
so
hard
does
habit
die
we
can
not
entirely
divorce
our
ideas
of
home
from
gardens
and
trees
and
green
grass
but
i
honestly
think
there
is
a
reward
for
living
in
a
slice
of
a
house
women
who
have
lived
long
in
the
country
sometimes
take
the
beauty
of
it
for
granted
but
the
woman
who
has
been
hedged
in
by
city
walls
gets
the
fine
joy
of
when
she
out
of
doors
and
a
pot
of
geraniums
means
more
to
her
than
a
whole
garden
means
to
a
woman
who
has
been
denied
the
privilege
of
watching
things
grow
the
modern
apartment
is
an
amazing
illustration
of
the
rapid
development
of
an
idea
the
larger
ones
are
quite
as
magnificent
as
any
houses
could
be
i
have
recently
furnished
a
chicago
apartment
that
included
large
and
small
salons
a
huge
conservatory
and
a
great
group
of
superb
rooms
that
are
worthy
of
a
palace
there
are
apartment
houses
in
new
york
that
offer
suites
of
fifteen
to
twenty
rooms
with
from
five
to
ten
baths
at
yearly
rentals
that
approximate
wealth
to
the
average
man
but
these
apartments
are
for
the
few
and
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
apartments
for
the
many
that
have
the
same
essential
conveniences
one
of
the
most
notable
achievements
of
the
apartment
house
architects
is
the
duplex
apartment
the
little
house
within
a
house
with
its
high
living
room
its
mezzanine
gallery
with
service
rooms
ranged
below
and
sleeping
rooms
above
its
fine
height
and
spaciousness
most
of
the
duplex
apartments
are
still
rather
expensive
but
some
of
them
are
to
be
had
at
rents
that
are
comparatively
low
rents
are
always
comparative
you
know
fortunately
although
it
is
a
far
cry
financially
from
the
duplex
apartment
to
the
tidy
flat
of
the
model
tenements
the
modern
improvements
are
very
much
the
same
the
model
tenement
offers
compact
domestic
machinery
and
cleanliness
and
sanitary
comforts
at
a
few
dollars
a
week
that
are
not
to
be
had
at
any
price
in
many
of
the
fine
old
houses
of
europe
the
peasant
who
has
lived
on
the
plane
of
the
animals
with
no
thought
of
cleanliness
or
indeed
of
anything
but
food
and
drink
and
shelter
comes
over
here
and
enjoys
improvements
that
our
stately
ancestors
of
a
few
generations
ago
would
have
believed
magical
enjoys
them
they
do
say
he
puts
his
coal
in
the
bath
tub
but
his
grandchildren
will
be
different
perhaps
but
enough
of
apartments
in
general
this
chapter
is
concerned
with
the
small
apartment
sought
by
you
young
people
who
are
beginning
housekeeping
you
want
to
find
just
the
proper
apartment
of
course
and
then
you
want
to
decorate
and
furnish
it
let
me
beg
of
you
to
demand
only
the
actual
essentials
a
decent
neighborhood
good
light
and
air
and
at
least
one
reasonably
large
room
do
demand
perfection
for
you
wo
find
it
make
up
your
mind
just
what
will
make
for
your
happiness
and
comfort
and
demand
that
you
can
make
any
place
livable
by
furnishing
it
wisely
and
oh
let
me
beg
of
you
do
buy
your
furniture
until
you
have
found
and
engaged
your
apartment
it
is
bad
enough
to
buy
furniture
for
a
house
you
have
seen
but
an
apartment
is
a
place
of
limitations
and
you
can
so
easily
mar
the
place
by
buying
things
that
will
not
fit
in
an
apartment
is
so
dependent
upon
proper
fittings
skilfully
placed
that
you
may
ruin
your
chances
of
a
real
home
if
you
go
ahead
blindly
before
you
sign
your
lease
be
sure
that
the
neighborhood
is
not
too
noisy
be
sure
that
you
will
have
plenty
of
light
and
air
and
heat
you
can
interview
the
other
tenants
and
find
out
about
many
things
you
have
time
or
the
experience
to
anticipate
be
sure
that
your
landlord
is
a
reasonable
human
being
who
will
consent
to
certain
changes
if
necessary
who
will
be
willing
for
you
to
build
in
certain
things
who
will
with
you
in
improving
his
property
if
you
go
about
it
tactfully
be
sure
that
the
woodwork
is
plain
and
unpretentious
that
the
are
logically
placed
and
of
simple
construction
is
there
anything
more
dreadful
than
those
colored
glass
domes
with
fringes
of
beads
that
landlords
so
proudly
hang
over
the
imaginary
be
sure
that
the
plumbing
is
in
good
condition
and
beware
the
bedroom
on
an
air
shaft
better
pay
a
little
more
rent
and
save
the
doctor
bills
beware
of
false
mantels
and
grotesque
and
imitation
stained
glass
and
grained
woodwork
you
could
be
happy
in
a
place
that
was
false
to
begin
with
having
found
just
the
combination
of
rooms
that
suggests
a
real
home
to
you
go
slowly
about
your
decorating
it
is
almost
imperative
that
the
woodwork
and
walls
should
have
the
same
finish
throughout
the
apartment
unless
you
wish
to
find
yourself
living
in
a
of
unfriendly
colors
i
have
seen
four
room
apartments
in
which
every
room
had
a
different
wall
paper
and
different
woodwork
the
parlor
was
papered
with
green
paper
with
imitation
mahogany
woodwork
the
had
walls
covered
with
red
burlap
and
woodwork
the
bedroom
was
done
in
pink
satin
finished
paper
and
maple
woodwork
and
the
kitchen
was
bilious
as
to
woodwork
with
bleak
gray
walls
could
anything
be
more
mistaken
you
can
make
the
most
commonplace
rooms
livable
if
you
will
paint
all
your
woodwork
cream
or
gray
or
sage
green
and
cover
your
walls
with
a
paper
of
very
much
the
same
tone
real
hard
wood
trim
is
used
in
ordinary
apartments
so
why
not
do
away
with
the
imitation
and
paint
it
you
can
look
through
thousands
of
samples
of
wall
papers
and
you
will
finally
have
to
admit
that
there
is
nothing
better
for
every
day
living
than
a
deep
cream
a
misty
gray
a
tan
or
a
buff
paper
you
may
have
a
certain
license
in
the
papering
of
your
bedrooms
of
course
but
the
hall
and
so
forth
should
be
pulled
together
with
walls
of
one
color
in
no
other
way
can
you
achieve
an
effect
of
spaciousness
and
spaciousness
is
the
thing
of
all
other
things
most
desirable
in
the
crowded
city
you
must
have
a
place
where
you
can
breathe
and
fling
your
arms
about
when
you
have
it
really
ready
for
furnishing
get
the
essentials
first
do
with
a
bed
and
a
chest
of
drawers
and
a
table
and
a
few
chairs
and
add
things
gradually
as
the
rooms
call
for
them
make
the
best
of
the
opportunities
offered
for
furniture
before
you
buy
another
thing
if
you
have
a
china
closet
in
your
you
can
plan
a
graceful
to
serve
as
a
buffet
or
and
you
will
require
only
a
good
table
not
too
heavily
built
and
a
few
chairs
for
this
room
there
is
rarely
a
room
that
would
not
be
improved
by
shelves
and
inset
mirrors
of
course
i
do
not
advise
you
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
someone
property
but
why
not
look
the
matter
squarely
in
the
face
this
is
to
be
your
home
you
will
find
a
number
of
things
that
annoy
you
life
in
any
city
furnishes
annoyances
but
if
you
have
one
or
two
reasonably
large
rooms
plenty
of
light
and
air
and
respectable
surroundings
make
up
your
mind
that
you
will
not
move
every
year
that
you
will
make
a
home
of
this
place
and
then
go
ahead
and
it
as
a
home
if
a
certain
recess
in
the
wall
suggests
bookshelves
do
grudge
the
few
dollars
necessary
to
have
the
bookshelves
built
in
you
can
probably
have
them
built
so
that
they
can
be
removed
on
that
far
day
when
this
apartment
is
no
longer
your
home
and
if
you
have
a
dreadful
wall
paper
do
hide
behind
the
silly
plea
that
the
landlord
will
not
change
it
go
without
a
new
gown
if
necessary
and
pay
for
the
paper
yourself
few
apartments
have
fireplaces
and
if
you
are
fortunate
enough
to
find
one
with
a
real
fireplace
and
a
simple
mantel
shelf
you
will
be
far
on
the
way
toward
making
a
home
of
your
group
of
rooms
of
course
your
apartment
is
heated
by
steam
or
hot
air
or
something
but
an
open
fire
of
coal
or
wood
will
be
very
pleasant
on
chilly
days
and
more
important
still
your
home
will
have
a
point
of
departure
the
hearth
if
the
mantel
shelf
is
surmounted
by
one
of
those
dreadful
monstrosities
made
up
of
gingerbread
woodwork
and
distressing
bits
of
mirrors
convince
your
landlord
that
it
will
not
be
injured
in
the
removing
and
store
it
during
your
residence
here
have
the
space
above
the
mantel
papered
like
the
rest
of
the
walls
and
hang
one
good
picture
or
a
good
mirror
or
some
such
thing
above
your
mantel
shelf
and
you
will
have
offered
up
your
homage
to
the
spirit
of
the
hearth
when
you
do
begin
to
buy
furniture
buy
compactly
buy
carefully
remember
that
you
will
not
require
the
furniture
your
mother
had
in
a
house
you
will
have
no
hall
or
piazza
furnishings
to
buy
for
instance
and
therefore
you
many
put
a
little
more
into
your
things
the
is
the
nucleus
of
the
modern
apartment
sometimes
it
is
studio
and
in
one
sometimes
library
and
by
the
grace
of
a
comfortable
and
a
certain
amount
of
drawer
or
closet
space
at
any
rate
it
will
be
more
surely
a
than
a
similar
room
in
a
large
house
and
therefore
everything
in
it
should
count
for
something
do
not
admit
an
unnecessary
rug
or
chair
or
picture
lest
you
lose
the
spaciousness
the
dignity
of
the
room
an
chair
will
fill
a
room
more
obviously
than
a
grand
piano
if
the
piano
is
properly
and
the
chair
improperly
placed
in
one
of
the
illustrations
of
this
chapter
you
will
observe
a
small
in
which
there
are
dozens
of
things
and
yet
the
effect
is
quiet
and
uncrowded
the
secretary
against
the
plain
wall
serves
as
a
cabinet
for
the
display
of
a
small
collection
of
fine
old
china
and
the
drawers
serve
the
chance
guest
for
while
this
is
library
and
it
has
a
most
comfortable
couch
bed
and
may
be
used
as
a
as
well
illustration
a
corner
of
my
own
boudoir
the
bookshelves
are
built
high
on
each
side
of
the
mantel
and
between
the
windows
thus
giving
shelf
room
to
a
goodly
collection
of
books
with
no
appearance
of
heaviness
the
is
placed
at
right
angles
to
the
windows
so
that
the
light
may
fall
on
the
writer
left
shoulder
there
is
a
couch
bed
over
three
feet
wide
in
this
room
with
frame
and
mattress
and
pillows
covered
in
a
dark
brocaded
stuff
and
a
fireside
chair
a
small
chair
at
the
head
of
the
couch
and
a
low
stool
all
covered
with
the
same
fabric
it
really
is
a
large
room
and
yet
it
abundantly
fills
a
dozen
needs
i
think
it
unwise
to
try
to
work
out
a
color
plan
in
a
small
apartment
if
your
floors
and
walls
are
neutral
in
tone
you
can
introduce
dozens
of
soft
colors
into
your
rooms
do
buy
massive
furniture
for
your
apartment
remember
that
a
few
good
chairs
of
willow
will
be
less
expensive
and
more
decorative
than
the
heavy
stuffy
chairs
usually
chosen
by
inexperienced
people
indeed
i
think
one
big
arm
chair
preferably
of
the
wing
variety
is
the
only
big
chair
you
will
require
in
the
a
fireside
chair
is
like
a
grandfather
clock
it
gives
so
much
dignity
to
a
room
that
it
is
worth
a
dozen
inferior
things
suppose
you
have
a
wing
chair
covered
with
corduroy
or
linen
or
chintz
a
large
willow
chair
with
a
basket
pocket
for
magazines
or
your
sewing
things
a
stool
or
so
of
wood
with
rush
or
cane
seats
and
a
straight
chair
or
so
perhaps
a
painted
windsor
chair
or
a
mahogany
chair
or
a
chair
of
brown
oak
depending
on
the
main
furniture
of
the
room
of
course
you
wo
need
anything
more
unless
you
have
space
for
a
comfortable
couch
if
you
have
mahogany
things
you
will
require
a
little
mahogany
table
at
the
head
of
the
couch
to
hold
a
a
would
be
excellent
a
or
turn
top
table
for
tea
or
possibly
a
nest
of
three
small
mahogany
tables
a
writing
table
or
book
table
built
on
very
simple
lines
will
be
needed
also
if
you
happen
to
have
a
conventional
a
table
would
be
charming
for
books
and
things
the
wing
chair
and
willow
chairs
and
the
chinese
chairs
will
go
beautifully
with
mahogany
things
or
with
oak
things
if
most
of
your
furniture
is
to
be
oak
be
sure
and
select
pieces
stained
a
soft
brown
and
waxed
oak
furniture
is
delightful
when
it
is
too
heavy
a
large
table
of
dark
brown
oak
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
tables
in
the
world
with
it
you
would
need
a
bench
of
oak
with
cane
or
rush
seat
a
small
octagonal
or
butterfly
oak
table
for
your
couch
end
and
one
or
two
windsor
chairs
oak
demands
simple
wholesome
surroundings
just
as
mahogany
permits
a
certain
feminine
elegance
oak
furniture
invites
printed
linens
and
books
and
brass
and
copper
and
pewter
and
gay
china
while
mahogany
may
be
successfully
used
with
such
things
it
may
also
be
used
with
brocade
and
fragile
china
and
carved
chairs
use
chintzes
in
your
apartment
if
you
wish
but
do
not
risk
the
light
ones
in
a
chintz
or
printed
linen
of
some
good
design
on
a
ground
of
mauve
blue
gray
or
black
will
decorate
your
apartment
adequately
if
you
make
straight
side
curtains
of
it
and
cover
one
chair
and
possibly
a
stool
with
it
do
carry
it
too
far
if
your
rooms
are
small
have
your
side
curtains
of
coarse
linen
or
raw
silk
in
dull
blue
orange
brown
or
whatever
color
you
choose
as
the
key
color
of
your
room
and
then
select
a
dark
chintz
with
your
chosen
color
dominant
in
its
design
and
cover
your
one
big
chair
with
that
the
apartment
hall
is
most
difficult
usually
long
and
narrow
and
uninteresting
do
try
to
have
furniture
in
a
hall
of
this
kind
a
small
table
near
the
front
door
a
good
tile
for
umbrellas
a
good
mirror
that
is
all
perhaps
a
place
for
coats
and
hats
but
some
halls
are
too
narrow
for
a
card
table
the
apartment
with
a
entirely
separated
from
the
is
very
unusual
therefore
i
am
hoping
that
you
will
apply
all
that
i
have
said
about
the
treatment
of
your
to
your
as
well
people
who
live
in
apartments
are
very
foolish
if
they
cut
off
a
room
so
little
used
as
a
and
furnish
it
as
if
it
belonged
to
a
huge
house
why
not
make
it
a
using
the
big
table
for
reading
between
meals
and
having
your
bookshelves
so
built
that
they
will
be
in
harmony
with
your
china
shelves
keep
all
your
glass
and
silver
and
china
in
the
kitchen
or
butler
pantry
and
display
only
the
excellent
things
the
old
china
the
pewter
tankard
the
brass
caddy
and
so
forth
in
the
however
if
you
have
a
real
in
your
apartment
do
try
to
have
chairs
that
will
be
comfortable
for
you
ca
afford
to
have
uncomfortable
things
in
so
small
a
space
windsor
chairs
and
rush
bottom
chairs
are
best
of
all
for
a
simple
i
think
though
the
revival
of
painted
furniture
has
brought
about
a
new
interest
in
the
old
chairs
painted
with
dull
soft
colored
posies
on
a
ground
of
dull
green
or
gray
or
black
these
chairs
would
be
charming
in
a
small
cottage
but
they
might
not
wear
well
in
a
city
apartment
illustration
bookshelves
in
a
small
room
if
your
apartment
has
two
small
bedrooms
why
not
use
one
of
them
for
two
single
beds
with
a
night
stand
between
and
the
other
for
a
apartment
bedrooms
are
usually
small
but
charming
furniture
may
be
bought
for
small
rooms
single
beds
of
mahogany
with
slender
posts
beds
of
painted
wood
with
inset
panels
of
cane
white
iron
beds
wooden
beds
painted
with
quaint
designs
on
a
ground
of
some
soft
color
all
these
are
excellent
for
small
rooms
it
goes
without
saying
that
a
small
bedroom
should
have
plain
walls
papered
or
painted
in
some
soft
color
flowered
papers
no
matter
how
delightful
they
may
be
make
a
small
room
seem
smaller
striped
papers
and
the
gingham
papers
are
sometimes
very
good
the
nicest
thing
about
such
modest
walls
is
that
you
can
use
gay
chintz
with
them
successfully
use
your
bedrooms
as
and
nothing
more
do
not
keep
your
sewing
things
there
a
big
will
add
to
the
homelike
quality
of
your
keep
the
bedroom
floor
bare
except
for
a
bedside
rug
and
possibly
one
or
two
other
rugs
this
of
course
does
not
apply
to
the
large
bedroom
i
am
prescribing
for
the
usual
small
one
place
your
bed
against
the
side
wall
so
that
the
morning
light
will
not
be
directly
in
your
eyes
a
folding
screen
covered
with
chintz
or
linen
will
prove
a
perhaps
you
will
have
a
but
i
doubt
it
most
women
find
it
more
satisfactory
and
less
expensive
to
send
their
guests
to
a
nearby
hotel
than
to
keep
an
extra
room
for
a
guest
the
guest
room
is
impractical
in
a
small
apartment
but
you
can
arrange
to
take
care
of
an
guest
by
planning
your
wisely
as
for
the
kitchen
that
is
another
story
it
is
impossible
to
go
into
that
subject
and
anyway
you
will
find
the
essentials
supplied
for
you
by
the
landlord
you
wo
need
my
advice
when
you
need
a
broom
or
a
coffee
pot
or
a
saucepan
you
go
buy
it
xvii
reproductions
of
antique
furniture
and
objects
of
art
one
must
have
preserved
many
naïve
illusions
if
one
may
believe
in
all
the
antiques
that
are
offered
in
the
marketplaces
of
the
world
even
the
greatest
connoisseurs
are
caught
napping
sometimes
as
in
the
case
of
the
famous
crown
supposedly
dating
to
the
fifth
century
which
was
for
a
brief
period
one
of
the
treasures
of
the
louvre
its
origin
was
finally
discovered
and
great
was
the
outcry
it
had
been
traced
to
a
viennese
artisan
a
worker
in
the
arts
and
crafts
illustration
harkness
cabinet
for
surely
if
the
great
men
of
the
louvre
could
be
so
deceived
it
is
obvious
that
the
amateur
collector
has
little
chance
at
the
hands
of
the
dealers
in
old
furniture
and
other
objects
of
art
fortunately
the
greatest
dealers
are
quite
honest
they
tell
you
frankly
if
the
old
chair
you
covet
is
really
old
if
it
has
been
partially
restored
or
if
it
is
a
copy
and
they
charge
you
accordingly
at
these
dealers
a
small
table
of
the
louis
xvi
period
or
a
single
chair
covered
in
the
original
tapestry
may
cost
as
much
as
a
man
in
modest
circumstances
would
spend
on
his
whole
house
almost
everything
outside
these
princely
shops
salons
is
a
better
word
is
false
or
atrociously
restored
please
remember
i
am
not
referring
to
reputable
dealers
but
to
the
smaller
fry
whose
name
is
legion
in
whose
shops
the
unwary
seeker
after
bargains
is
sure
to
be
taken
in
italy
is
i
think
the
greatest
workshop
of
fraudulent
reproductions
it
has
an
output
that
all
europe
and
america
can
never
exhaust
little
children
on
the
streets
of
naples
still
find
simpletons
of
ardent
faith
who
will
buy
scraps
of
old
plaster
and
bits
of
paving
stones
that
are
alleged
to
have
been
excavated
in
pompeii
in
writing
about
antiques
it
is
not
easy
to
be
consistent
and
any
general
conclusion
is
impossible
certain
reproductions
are
objectionable
and
yet
they
are
certainly
better
than
poor
originals
after
all
the
simplest
advice
is
the
best
and
easiest
to
follow
the
less
a
copy
suggests
an
attempt
at
artistic
reproduction
the
more
literal
and
mechanical
it
is
in
its
copy
of
the
original
the
better
it
is
a
good
photograph
of
a
fine
old
painting
is
superior
to
the
average
copy
in
oils
or
watercolors
a
chair
honestly
copied
from
a
worm
eaten
original
is
better
for
domestic
purpose
than
the
original
the
original
the
moment
its
usefulness
is
past
belongs
in
a
museum
a
plaster
cast
of
a
great
bust
is
better
than
the
same
object
copied
in
marble
or
bronze
by
an
average
sculptor
and
so
it
goes
think
it
out
for
yourself
it
may
be
argued
that
the
budding
collector
is
as
happy
with
a
false
object
and
a
fake
bauble
as
if
he
possessed
the
real
thing
and
therefore
it
were
better
to
leave
him
to
his
illusions
that
it
is
his
own
fault
that
it
is
so
much
the
worse
for
him
if
he
is
deceived
but
you
ca
leave
the
innocent
lamb
to
the
slaughter
if
you
can
give
him
a
helping
hand
if
he
must
be
a
collector
let
him
be
first
a
collector
of
the
many
excellent
books
now
published
on
old
furniture
china
rugs
pewter
silver
prints
the
things
that
will
come
his
way
you
ca
begin
collecting
one
thing
without
developing
an
enthusiasm
for
the
contemporary
things
let
him
study
the
museum
collections
visit
the
private
collections
consult
recognized
experts
if
he
is
serious
he
will
gradually
acquire
the
intuition
of
knowing
the
genuine
from
the
false
the
from
the
worthless
and
once
he
has
that
knowledge
instinct
call
it
what
you
will
he
can
never
be
satisfied
with
imitations
the
collection
and
association
of
antiques
and
reproductions
should
be
determined
by
the
collector
sense
of
fitness
it
seems
to
me
every
man
should
depend
on
whatever
instinct
for
rightness
for
suitability
he
may
possess
if
he
finds
that
he
dare
not
risk
his
individual
opinion
then
let
him
be
content
with
the
things
he
to
be
both
beautiful
and
useful
and
leave
the
subtler
decisions
for
someone
else
for
instance
there
are
certain
objects
that
are
obviously
the
better
for
age
the
objects
that
are
softened
and
refined
by
a
bloom
that
comes
from
usage
an
old
rug
has
a
softness
that
a
new
one
can
not
imitate
an
old
copper
kettle
has
an
uneven
quality
that
has
come
from
years
of
use
a
new
kettle
may
be
quite
as
useful
but
age
has
given
the
old
one
a
certain
quality
that
hanging
and
pounding
can
not
reproduce
a
pewter
platter
that
has
been
used
for
generations
is
dulled
and
softened
to
a
glow
that
a
new
platter
can
not
rival
what
charm
is
to
a
woman
the
vague
thing
called
quality
is
to
an
object
of
art
we
feel
it
though
we
may
not
be
able
to
explain
it
an
old
etruscan
jar
may
be
reproduced
in
form
but
it
would
be
silly
to
attempt
the
reproduction
of
the
crudenesses
that
gave
the
old
jar
its
real
beauty
in
short
objects
that
depend
on
form
and
fine
workmanship
for
their
beauty
may
be
successfully
reproduced
but
objects
that
depend
on
imperfections
of
workmanship
on
the
crudeness
of
primitive
fabrics
on
the
fading
of
vegetable
dyes
on
the
bloom
that
age
alone
can
give
should
not
be
imitated
we
may
introduce
a
reproduction
of
a
fine
bust
into
our
rooms
but
an
imitation
of
a
persian
tile
or
a
venetian
vase
is
absurd
on
the
face
of
it
the
antiques
the
average
american
householder
is
interested
in
are
the
old
mahogany
oak
and
walnut
things
that
stand
for
the
oldest
period
of
our
own
particular
history
it
is
only
the
wealthy
collector
who
goes
abroad
and
buys
masses
of
old
european
furniture
real
or
sham
who
is
concerned
with
the
merits
and
demerits
of
french
and
italian
furniture
the
native
problem
is
the
colonial
mahogany
that
is
always
alleged
to
be
chippendale
or
heppelwhite
or
sheraton
regardless
there
must
be
thousands
of
these
alleged
antiques
in
new
york
shops
alone
it
goes
without
saying
that
only
a
very
small
part
of
it
can
be
really
old
as
for
it
having
been
made
by
the
men
whose
names
it
bears
that
is
something
no
reputable
dealer
would
affirm
the
chippendales
father
son
and
grandson
published
books
of
designs
which
were
used
by
all
the
of
their
day
no
one
can
swear
to
a
piece
of
furniture
having
been
made
in
the
workshops
of
the
chippendales
even
the
pieces
in
the
metropolitan
museum
are
marked
chippendale
style
or
in
the
sheraton
manner
or
some
such
way
if
the
furniture
is
in
the
style
of
these
makers
and
if
it
is
really
old
you
will
pay
a
small
fortune
for
it
but
even
then
you
can
not
hope
to
get
more
than
you
pay
for
and
you
would
be
very
silly
to
pay
for
a
name
after
all
chippendale
is
a
sort
of
god
among
amateur
collectors
of
american
furniture
but
among
more
seasoned
collectors
he
is
not
by
any
means
placed
first
he
adapted
and
borrowed
and
produced
some
wonderful
things
but
he
also
produced
some
monstrosities
as
you
will
see
if
you
visit
the
english
museums
why
then
lend
yourself
to
possible
deception
why
pay
for
names
when
museums
are
unable
to
buy
them
if
your
object
is
to
furnish
your
home
suitably
what
need
have
you
of
antiques
the
serious
amateur
will
fight
shy
of
miracles
if
he
admires
the
beauty
of
line
of
a
fine
old
heppelwhite
bed
or
sheraton
sideboard
he
will
have
reproductions
made
by
an
expert
the
new
piece
will
not
have
the
soft
darkness
of
the
old
but
the
owner
will
be
planning
that
soft
darkness
for
his
grandchildren
and
in
the
meantime
he
will
have
a
beautiful
thing
to
live
with
the
age
of
a
piece
of
furniture
is
of
great
value
to
a
museum
but
for
domestic
purposes
use
and
beauty
will
do
how
fine
your
home
will
be
if
all
the
things
within
it
have
those
qualities
look
through
the
photographs
shown
on
these
pages
there
are
many
old
chairs
and
tables
but
there
are
more
new
ones
i
am
not
one
of
these
decorators
who
insist
on
originals
i
believe
good
reproductions
are
more
valuable
than
feeble
originals
unless
you
are
buying
your
furniture
as
a
speculation
you
can
buy
a
reproduction
of
a
chippendale
ladder
back
chair
for
about
dollars
but
an
original
chair
would
cost
at
least
a
hundred
and
fifty
and
then
it
would
be
in
the
style
and
period
of
chippendale
it
might
amuse
you
to
ask
the
curator
of
one
of
the
british
museums
the
price
of
one
of
the
chippendales
chippendale
it
would
buy
you
a
tidy
little
acreage
stuart
and
cromwellian
chairs
are
being
more
and
more
reproduced
these
chairs
are
made
of
oak
the
stuart
ones
with
seats
and
backs
of
cane
the
cromwellian
ones
with
seats
and
backs
of
tapestry
needlework
corded
velvet
or
some
such
handsome
fabric
these
reproductions
may
be
had
at
from
to
dollars
each
of
course
the
cost
of
the
cromwellian
chairs
might
be
greatly
increased
by
expensive
coverings
there
is
a
graceful
louis
xv
sofa
in
the
petit
trianon
that
i
have
copied
many
times
the
copy
is
as
beautiful
as
the
original
because
this
sort
of
furniture
depends
upon
exquisite
design
and
perfect
workmanship
for
its
beauty
it
is
possible
that
a
modern
craftsman
might
not
have
achieved
so
graceful
a
design
but
the
perfection
of
his
workmanship
can
not
be
gainsaid
the
frame
of
the
sofa
must
be
carved
and
then
painted
and
guilded
many
times
before
it
is
ready
for
the
brocade
covering
and
the
cost
of
three
hundred
dollars
for
the
finished
sofa
is
not
too
much
the
original
could
not
be
purchased
at
any
price
then
there
is
the
chinese
lacquer
furniture
of
the
chippendale
period
that
we
are
using
so
much
now
the
process
of
lacquering
is
as
tedious
as
it
ever
was
and
the
reproductions
sell
for
goodly
sums
a
tall
secretary
of
black
and
gold
lacquer
may
cost
six
hundred
dollars
you
can
imagine
what
an
eighteenth
century
piece
would
cost
the
person
who
said
that
a
taste
for
old
furniture
and
bibelots
was
worse
than
a
passion
it
was
a
vice
was
certainly
near
the
truth
it
is
an
absorbing
pursuit
an
obsession
and
it
grows
with
what
it
feeds
on
as
in
objects
of
art
so
in
old
furniture
the
supply
will
always
equal
the
demand
of
the
unwary
the
serious
amateur
will
fight
shy
of
all
miracles
and
content
himself
with
excellent
reproductions
nothing
later
than
the
furniture
of
the
eighteenth
century
is
included
in
the
term
old
furniture
there
are
many
fine
cabinet
makers
in
the
early
nineteenth
century
but
from
them
until
the
last
decade
the
horrors
that
were
perpetrated
have
never
been
equaled
in
the
history
of
household
decorations
i
fancy
the
furniture
of
the
era
will
never
be
coveted
by
collectors
unless
someone
should
build
a
museum
for
the
freakish
objects
of
house
furnishing
america
could
contribute
much
to
such
a
collection
for
surely
the
black
walnut
era
of
the
nineteenth
century
will
never
be
surpassed
in
ugliness
and
bad
taste
unless
rare
fortune
there
should
be
a
sudden
epidemic
of
appreciation
among
which
would
result
in
their
taking
the
beautiful
wood
in
the
black
walnut
beds
and
wardrobes
and
such
and
make
it
over
into
things
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
release
the
mistreated
velvety
wood
from
its
grotesqueries
and
give
it
a
renaissance
in
graceful
cabinets
small
tables
footstools
and
the
many
small
things
that
could
be
so
easily
made
from
huge
unwieldy
wardrobes
and
beds
and
bureaux
the
workmen
of
have
their
eyes
opened
they
have
no
excuse
for
producing
unworthy
things
when
the
greatest
private
collections
are
loaned
or
given
outright
to
the
museums
the
new
wing
of
the
metropolitan
museum
in
new
york
houses
several
fine
old
collections
of
furniture
the
hoentschel
collection
for
which
the
wing
was
really
planned
having
been
given
to
the
people
of
new
york
by
pierpont
morgan
this
collection
is
an
education
in
the
french
decorative
arts
then
too
there
is
the
bolles
collection
of
american
furniture
presented
to
the
museum
by
russell
sage
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
honest
dealers
who
are
making
fine
and
sincere
copies
of
such
furniture
and
selling
them
as
copies
there
is
no
deception
here
we
must
respect
these
men
as
we
respect
the
workers
of
the
eighteenth
century
we
give
them
respect
for
their
masterly
workmanship
their
appreciation
of
the
best
things
and
their
fidelity
to
the
masterpieces
they
reproduce
not
so
long
ago
the
new
york
papers
published
the
experience
of
a
gentleman
who
bought
a
very
beautiful
divan
in
a
european
furniture
shop
he
paid
for
it
you
may
be
sure
of
that
and
he
could
hardly
wait
for
its
arrival
to
show
it
to
his
less
fortunate
neighbors
within
a
few
months
something
happened
to
the
lining
of
the
divan
and
he
discovered
on
the
inside
of
the
frame
the
maker
name
and
address
imagine
his
chagrin
when
he
found
that
the
divan
had
been
made
at
a
furniture
factory
in
his
own
country
you
ca
be
sorry
for
him
you
feel
that
it
served
him
right
illustration
a
banquette
of
the
louis
xv
period
covered
with
needlework
illustration
a
chinese
chippendale
sofa
covered
with
chintz
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
vain
collector
who
can
not
judge
for
himself
but
will
not
admit
it
he
has
not
developed
his
sense
of
beauty
his
instinct
for
excellence
of
workmanship
he
thinks
that
because
he
has
the
money
to
pay
for
the
treasure
the
treasure
must
be
genuine
has
chosen
it
i
can
quite
understand
the
pleasure
that
goes
with
furnishing
a
really
old
house
with
objects
of
the
period
in
which
the
house
was
built
a
new
england
farmhouse
for
instance
may
be
an
inspiration
to
the
owner
and
you
can
understand
her
quest
of
old
fashioned
rush
bottomed
chairs
and
painted
settles
and
quaint
mirrors
and
blue
homespun
coverlets
you
can
understand
the
man
who
falls
heir
to
a
good
square
old
colonial
house
who
wishes
to
keep
his
furnishings
true
to
the
period
but
you
can
not
understand
the
crying
need
for
eighteenth
century
furniture
in
a
modern
shingle
house
or
the
desire
for
old
spinning
wheels
and
battered
kitchen
utensils
in
a
spanish
stucco
house
or
chippendale
furniture
in
a
forest
bungalow
i
wish
people
generally
would
study
the
oak
and
walnut
furniture
of
old
england
and
use
more
reproductions
of
these
honest
solid
pieces
of
furniture
in
their
houses
its
beauty
is
that
it
is
at
home
in
simple
american
houses
and
yet
by
virtue
of
its
very
usefulness
and
sturdiness
it
is
not
out
of
place
in
a
room
where
beautiful
objects
of
other
periods
are
used
the
long
oak
table
that
is
so
comfortably
ample
for
books
and
magazines
and
flowers
in
your
may
be
copied
from
an
old
refectory
table
but
what
of
it
it
fulfils
its
new
mission
just
as
frankly
as
the
original
table
served
the
monks
who
used
it
the
soft
brown
of
oak
is
a
pleasure
after
the
mahogany
of
a
thousand
rooms
i
do
not
wish
to
condemn
colonial
mahogany
furniture
you
understand
i
simply
wish
to
remind
you
that
there
are
other
woods
and
models
available
french
furniture
of
the
best
type
represents
the
supreme
art
of
the
and
is
incomparable
for
formal
rooms
but
i
am
afraid
the
time
will
never
come
when
french
furniture
will
be
interchangeable
with
the
oak
and
mahogany
of
england
and
america
in
short
the
whole
thing
should
be
a
matter
of
taste
and
suitability
if
you
have
a
few
fine
old
things
that
have
come
to
you
from
your
ancestors
a
grandfather
clock
an
old
portrait
or
two
you
are
quite
justified
in
bringing
good
reproductions
of
similar
things
into
your
home
the
effect
is
the
thing
you
are
after
is
it
then
too
you
will
escape
the
awful
fever
that
makes
any
antique
seem
desirable
and
in
buying
reproductions
you
can
select
really
comfortable
furniture
you
will
be
independent
of
the
dreadful
vases
and
candelabra
and
steel
engravings
of
the
period
and
will
feel
free
to
use
modern
prints
and
chinese
porcelains
and
willow
chairs
and
anything
that
fits
into
your
home
i
can
think
of
no
slavery
more
deadly
to
one
sense
of
humor
than
collecting
antiques
indiscriminately

xviii
the
art
of
trelliage
when
i
planned
the
trellis
room
of
the
colony
club
in
new
york
i
had
hard
work
finding
workmen
who
could
appreciate
the
importance
of
crossing
and
recrossing
little
strips
of
green
wood
of
arranging
them
to
form
a
mural
decoration
architectural
in
treatment
this
trellis
room
was
i
believe
the
first
in
america
to
be
so
considered
though
the
use
of
trellis
is
as
old
as
architecture
in
japan
china
arabia
egypt
italy
france
and
spain
the
earliest
examples
of
trellis
work
shown
are
in
certain
roman
frescoes
in
pompeii
the
mural
paintings
give
us
a
very
good
idea
of
what
some
of
the
roman
gardens
were
like
in
the
entrance
hall
of
the
house
of
sallust
is
represented
a
garden
with
trellised
niches
and
bubbling
fountains
representations
that
have
come
down
to
us
in
documents
show
that
china
and
japan
both
employed
the
trellis
in
their
decorative
schemes
you
will
find
a
most
daring
example
on
your
old
blue
willow
plate
if
you
will
look
closely
enough
the
bridge
over
which
the
flying
princess
goes
to
her
lover
is
a
good
model
and
could
be
built
in
many
gardens
even
a
tiny
modern
garden
yours
or
mine
might
hold
this
fairy
bridge
almost
all
arabian
decorations
have
their
basis
in
trellis
design
or
arabesques
filled
in
with
the
intricate
tracery
that
covers
all
their
buildings
if
we
examine
the
details
of
the
most
famous
of
the
old
moorish
buildings
that
remain
to
us
the
mosque
at
cordova
and
the
alhambra
at
granada
we
shall
find
them
full
of
endless
trellis
suggestions
indeed
there
are
many
documents
still
extant
showing
how
admirably
trellis
decoration
lends
itself
to
the
decoration
of
gardens
and
interiors
there
are
dozens
of
examples
of
niches
built
to
hold
fine
busts
pavilions
and
summer
houses
the
quaint
gazebos
of
old
england
the
graceful
screens
of
trellis
that
terminate
a
long
garden
path
the
arching
gateways
crowned
with
vines
all
these
may
be
reproduced
quite
easily
in
american
gardens
the
first
trellis
work
in
france
was
inspired
by
italy
but
the
french
gave
it
a
perfection
of
architectural
character
not
found
in
other
countries
the
manuscript
of
the
romance
of
the
rose
dating
back
to
the
fifteenth
century
contains
the
finest
possible
example
of
trellis
in
a
medieval
garden
most
of
the
old
french
gardens
that
remain
to
us
have
important
trellis
construction
at
blois
one
still
sees
the
remains
of
a
fine
trellis
covering
the
walls
of
the
kitchen
gardens
wonderful
and
elaborate
trellis
each
containing
a
statue
often
formed
the
centers
of
very
old
gardens
these
garden
houses
were
called
gazebos
in
england
and
temples
of
love
in
france
and
the
statue
most
often
seen
was
the
god
of
love
in
the
trianon
gardens
at
versailles
there
is
a
charming
standing
on
a
tiny
island
with
four
small
canals
leading
to
it
a
knowledge
of
the
history
of
trelliage
and
an
appreciation
of
its
practical
application
to
modern
needs
is
a
conjurer
wand
you
can
wave
it
and
create
all
sorts
of
ephemeral
constructions
that
will
last
your
time
and
pleasure
you
may
give
your
trellis
any
poetic
shape
your
vision
may
take
you
may
dream
and
realize
enchanting
gardens
with
clipped
hedges
and
trellis
walls
you
may
transform
a
commonplace
porch
into
a
gay
garden
room
with
a
few
screens
of
trellis
and
many
flower
boxes
of
shrubs
and
vines
here
indeed
is
a
delightful
medium
for
your
fancy
trelliage
and
lattice
work
are
often
used
as
interchangeable
terms
but
mistakenly
for
any
carpenter
who
has
the
gift
of
precision
can
build
a
good
lattice
but
a
trellis
must
have
architectural
character
trellis
work
is
not
necessarily
flimsy
construction
the
light
chestnut
laths
that
were
used
by
the
old
frenchmen
and
still
remain
to
us
prove
that
always
in
a
garden
i
think
one
must
feel
one
has
not
come
to
the
end
one
must
go
on
and
on
in
search
of
new
beauties
and
the
hidden
delights
we
feel
sure
must
be
behind
the
clipped
hedges
or
the
trellis
walls
even
when
we
come
to
the
end
we
are
not
quite
sure
it
is
the
end
and
we
steep
ourselves
in
seclusion
and
quiet
knowing
full
well
that
or
perhaps
when
the
moon
is
up
and
we
come
back
as
we
promise
ourselves
to
do
surely
we
shall
see
that
ideal
corner
that
is
the
last
word
of
the
perfection
of
our
dream
garden
that
delectable
spot
for
which
we
forever
seek
we
can
bring
back
much
of
the
charm
of
the
gardens
by
a
judicious
use
of
trellis
it
is
suitable
for
every
form
of
outdoor
construction
a
new
garden
can
be
subdivided
and
made
livable
in
a
few
months
with
trellis
screens
where
hedges
even
of
the
quick
growing
privet
would
take
years
to
grow
the
entrance
to
the
famous
maze
at
versailles
now
alas
utterly
destroyed
was
in
trellis
and
i
have
reproduced
in
our
own
garden
at
villa
trianon
in
versailles
the
entrance
arch
and
doors
all
in
trellis
our
high
garden
fence
with
its
curving
gate
is
also
in
trellis
and
you
can
imagine
the
joy
with
which
we
watched
the
vines
grow
climbing
over
the
gatetop
as
gracefully
as
if
they
too
felt
the
charm
of
the
curving
tracery
of
green
strips
and
cheerfully
added
the
decoration
of
their
leaves
and
tendrils

is
at

end
of
the

garden
in

with
the
terrace
where
we
take
our

this
trellis
was
rebuilt
many
times
before
it
satisfied
me
but
now
it
is
my
greatest
joy
the
niches
are
planned
to
hold
two
old
statues
and
several

trees
i
used
very
much
the
same
constructive

there
a

all
these

it
may
be
fitted
to
interior
uses
most
skilfully
pictures
of
the
trellis
room
in
the
colony
club
have
been
shown
so
often
it
is
not
necessary
to
repeat
more
than
one
of
them
the
room
is
long
and
high
with
a
floor
of
large
red
tiles
the

are
covered
with
rough
gray
plaster

the

we
all
know
this
is
lattice
not

in
no

should
be

i
recently
planned
a
most
beautiful
trellis
room
for
a
new
york
city
house
the
room
is
long
and
narrow
with
walls
divided
into
panels
by
upright
classic
columns
the
lower
wall
space
between
the
columns
is
covered
with
a
simple
green
lattice
and
the
upper
part
is
filled
with
little
mirrors
framed
in
narrow
green
moldings
arranged
in
a
conventional
design
which
follows
the
line
of
the
trellis
one
end
of
the
room
is
made
up
of
two
narrow
panels
of
the
trellis
with
a
fireplace
between
on
the
opposite
wall
the
middle
panel
is
a
background
for
a
delightful
wall
fountain
the
fretwork
of
mirrors
which
takes
the
place
of
frieze
in
the
room
is
continued
all
around
the
four
walls
one
of
the
walls
is
filled
entirely
with
french
doors
of
plate
glass
beneath
the
mirrored
frieze
the
other
long
wall
has
the
broad
central
panel
cut
into
two
doors
of
plate
glass
and
stone
benches
placed
against
the
two
trellised
panels
flanking
the
doors
the
ceiling
is
divided
into
three
great
panels
of
trellis
and
from
each
of
the
three
panels
a
lantern
is
suspended
in
the
guinness
house
in
new
york
there
is
a
little
hallway
wainscoted
in
white
with
a
green
trellis
covering
the
wall
space
above
against
this
simple
trellis
it
is
really
a
lattice
a
number
of
plaster
casts
are
hung
in
one
corner
an
old
marble
bowl
holds
a
grapevine
which
has
been
trained
over
the
walls
the
floor
is
of
white
tiles
with
a
narrow
greek
border
of
black
and
white
this
decoration
of
a
little
hall
might
be
copied
very
easily
the
architects
are
building
nowadays
many
houses
that
have
a
or
conservatory
or
breakfast
room
the
smallest
cottage
may
have
a
little
breakfast
room
done
in
green
and
white
lattice
with
green
painted
furniture
and
simple
flower
boxes
i
have
had
furniture
of
the
most
satisfactory
designs
made
for
my
trellis
rooms
green
painted
wood
with
cane
insets
seems
most
suitable
for
the
small
rooms
and
the
marbles
of
the
old
trellised
may
be
replaced
by
cement
benches
in
our
modern
trellis
pavillions
there
is
so
much
of
modern
furniture
that
is
refreshing
in
line
and
color
and
adapted
to
these
there
is
a
desk
made
by
aitchen
a
notable
furniture
designer
in
london
which
i
have
used
in
a
the
desk
is
painted
white
and
is
decorated
with
heavy
lines
of
dark
green
the
drawer
front
and
the
doors
of
the
little
cupboard
are
filled
with
cane
the
knobs
are
of
green
this
desk
would
be
nice
in
a
white
in
a
summer
cottage
though
it
was
planned
for
a
trellis
room
it
could
be
used
as
a
dressing
table
with
a
bench
or
chair
of
white
outlined
in
green
and
a
good
mirror
in
white
and
green
frame
another
desk
i
have
made
is
called
a
jardiniere
table
and
was
designed
for
ogden
armour
garden
room
at
lake
forest
the
desk
or
table
is
painted
gray
with
faint
green
decorations
at
each
end
of
the
long
top
there
is
a
sunken
box
to
hold
growing
plants
between
the
flower
boxes
there
is
the
usual
arrangement
of
the
desk
outfit
blotter
pad
paper
rack
ink
pots
and
so
forth
the
spaces
beneath
the
flower
boxes
are
filled
with
shelves
for
books
and
magazines
this
idea
is
thoroughly
practicable
for
any
garden
room
and
is
so
simple
that
it
could
be
constructed
by
any
man
who
knows
how
to
use
tools

looking
over
the
to
the
trellis
i
had
the
pleasure
recently
of
planning
a
trellis
room
for
house
at
center
island
new
york
here
indeed
is
a
garden
room
with
a
proper
environment
it
is
as
beautiful
as
a
room
very
well
can
be
within
and
its
great
arched
windows
frame
vistas
of
trees
and
water
which
take
their
place
as
a
part
of
the
room
ever
changing
landscapes
that
are
always
captivating
this
trellis
room
is
beautifully
proportioned
and
large
enough
to
hold
four
long
sofas
and
many
chairs
and
tables
of
wicker
and
painted
wood
the
grouping
of
the
sofas
and
the
long
tables
made
to
fit
between
them
is
most
interesting
these
tables
are
extremely
narrow
and
just
the
length
of
the
sofas
and
are
built
after
the
idea
of
armour
garden
room
desk
with
flower
boxes
sunk
in
the
ends
the
backs
of
two
sofas
are
placed
against
the
long
sides
of
the
table
which
holds
a
reading
lamp
and
books
in
addition
to
its
masses
of
flowers
at
the
ends
two
such
groups
divide
the
room
into
three
smaller
rooms
as
you
can
see
by
the
illustration
small
tables
and
chairs
are
pulled
up
to
the
sofas
making
conversation
centers
or
comfortable
places
for
reading
the
trellis
work
covers
the
spaces
between
windows
and
doors
and
follows
the
contour
of
the
arches
the
ceiling
is
bordered
with
the
trellis
and
from
a
great
square
of
it
in
the
center
a
lamp
is
suspended
the
wall
panels
are
broken
by
appliques
that
suggest
the
bounty
of
summer
flowers
and
leaves
and
vines
in
wrought
and
painted
iron
there
are
pedestals
surmounted
by
marbles
against
some
of
the
panels
and
a
carved
bracket
supporting
a
magnificent
bust
high
on
one
of
the
wider
panels
the
room
is
classic
in
its
fine
balance
and
its
architectural
formality
and
modern
in
its
luxurious
comfort
and
its
refreshing
color
surely
there
could
be
no
pleasanter

for
whiling

story
of

came
true

we
believed
in

fairy
stories
are
ready
and
waiting
to
come
true
if
only
people
will
believe
in
them
long
enough
for
many
years
elizabeth
marbury
and
i
had
spent
our
summers
in
that
charming
french
town
versailles
before
we
had
any
hope
of
realizing
a
home
of
our
own
there
we
loved
the
place
with
its
glamour
of
romance
and
history
and
we
prowled
around
the
old
gardens
and
explored
the
old
houses
and
dreamed
dreams
and
saw
visions
one
old
house
that
particularly
interested
us
was
the
villa
that
had
once
been
the
home
of
the
duc
de
nemours
son
of
louis
philippe
it
was
situated
directly
on
the
famous
park
of
versailles
which
is
as
everyone
knows
one
of
the
most
beautiful
parks
in
all
the
world
the
villa
had
not
been
lived
in
since
the
occupancy
of
de
nemours
before
the
villa
came
to
de
nemours
it
had
been
a
part
of
the
royal
property
that
was
portioned
out
to
mesdames
de
france
the
disagreeable
daughters
of
louis
xv
you
will
remember
how
disagreeable
they
were
to
marie
antoinette
and
what
a
burden
they
made
her
life
i
wish
our
house
had
belonged
to
more
romantic
people
madame
du
barry
or
madame
de
pompadour
would
have
suited
me
better
how
many
many
times
we
peeped
through
the
high
iron
railing
at
this
enchanted
domain
sleeping
like
the
castle
in
the
fairy
tale
the
garden
was
overgrown
with
weeds
and
shrubbery
the
house
was
shabby
and
sadly
in
need
of
paint
we
sighed
and
thought
how
happy
would
be
our
fortune
if
we
might
some
day
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
the
tangled
garden
and
the
abandoned
villa
little
did
we
dream
that
this
would
one
day
be
our
home
we
first
went
to
versailles
as
casual
summer
visitors
and
our
stay
was
brief
we
loved
it
so
much
that
the
next
summer
we
went
again
this
time
for
the
season
and
found
ourselves
members
of
a
happy
pension
family
then
we
decided
to
rent
an
apartment
of
our
own
for
the
next
year
and
soon
we
were
considering
the
leases
of
houses
and
finally
we
arrived
at
the
supreme
audacity
of
negotiating
for
the
purchase
of
one
we
had
a
great
friend
in
versailles
victorien
sardou
the
novelist
and
playwright
so
honored
by
the
people
of
france
his
wonderful
house
at
marly
le
roi
was
a
constant
joy
to
us
and
made
us
always
more
eager
for
a
permanent
home
of
our
own
in
the
neighborhood
sardou
was
as
eager
for
the
finding
of
our
house
as
we
were
and
it
was
he
who
finally
made
it
possible
for
us
to
buy
our
historic
villa
he
did
everything
for
us
introduced
us
to
his
friends
wonderful
and
brilliant
people
gave
us
liberally
of
his
charm
and
knowledge
and
finally
gave
us
the
chance
to
buy
this
old
house
and
its
two
acres
of
gardens
the
negotiations
for
the
house
were
long
and
tedious
our
offer
was
an
insult
a
joke
a
ridiculous
affair
to
the
man
who
had
the
selling
of
it
he
laughed
at
us
and
demanded
twice
the
amount
of
our
offer
we
were
firm
outwardly
and
refused
to
meet
him
halfway
but
secretly
we
spent
hours
and
hours
in
the
old
house
sitting
patiently
on
folding
and
planning
the
remaking
of
the
house
as
happily
as
children
playing
i
remember
vividly
the
three
of
us
miss
marbury
sardou
and
i
standing
in
the
garden
on
a
very
rainy
day
sardou
was
bounding
up
and
down
saying
buy
it
buy
it
if
you
do
buy
it
before
twelve
i
will
buy
it
myself
we
were
standing
there
soaking
wet
perfectly
oblivious
to
the
downpour
wondering
if
we
dared
do
such
an
audacious
thing
as
to
purchase
property
so
far
from
our
american
anchorage
illustration
a
fine
old
console
in
the
villa
trianon
well
we
bought
it
and
at
our
own
price
practically
and
for
eight
years
we
have
been
restoring
the
house
and
gardens
to
their
seventeenth
century
beauty
sardou
was
our
neighbor
and
his
wonderful
château
at
marly
overlooking
the
valley
and
terraces
of
germain
was
a
surprise
to
us
so
full
was
it
of
beauty
and
charm
so
flavored
with
the
personality
of
its
owner
sardou
was
of
great
help
to
us
when
we
finally
purchased
our
house
his
fund
of
information
never
failed
us
there
seemed
to
be
no
question
he
could
not
answer
he
was
quite
the
most
erudite
man
i
have
ever
known
he
had
as
much
to
say
about
the
restoration
of
our
house
as
we
he
introduced
us
to
monsieur
de
nolhac
the
conservator
of
the
château
de
versailles
who
gave
us
the
details
of
our
villa
as
it
had
been
a
century
and
a
half
ago
and
helped
us
remake
the
garden
on
the
lines
of
the
original
one
he
loaned
us
pictures
and
documents
and
we
felt
we
were
living
in
a
modern
version
of
the
sleeping
beauty
with
the
sleeping
villa
for
heroine
our
house
had
always
been
called
villa
trianon
and
so
we
kept
the
name
but
it
should
not
be
confused
with
the
grand
trianon
or
the
petit
trianon
of
course
everyone
knows
about
the
park
at
versailles
but
everyone
forgets
so
i
shall
review
the
history
of
the
park
briefly
that
you
may
appreciate
our
thrills
when
we
really
owned
a
bit
of
it
louis
xiv
selected
versailles
as
the
site
for
the
royal
palace
when
it
was
a
swampy
uninteresting
little
farm
louis
xiii
had
built
a
château
there
in
but
had
done
little
to
beautify
the
flat
acres
surrounding
it
louis
the
magnificent
lavished
fortunes
on
the
laying
out
of
his
new
park
the
grand
trianon
was
built
for
madame
de
main
tenon
in
and
from
this
time
on
for
a
full
century
the
park
of
versailles
was
the
most
famous
royal
residence
in
the
world
the
petit
trianon
was
built
by
louis
xv
for
madame
du
barry
later
during
the
reign
of
louis
xvi
marie
antoinette
who
was
then
queen
tiring
of
court
etiquette
and
scorning
the
stately
rooms
of
versailles
persuaded
her
husband
to
make
over
to
her
the
petit
trianon
here
she
built
a
number
of
little
rustic
cottages
where
she
and
the
ladies
of
her
court
dressed
in
calicoes
played
at
being
milkmaids
they
had
a
little
cottage
called
the
laiterie
where
the
white
cows
with
their
gilded
horns
were
brought
in
to
be
milked
here
too
little
plays
were
presented
in
a
tiny
theater
where
only
the
members
of
the
court
were
admitted
the
queen
and
her
brother
comte
de
provence
were
always
the
chief
actors
our
villa
adjoins
the
park
proper
in
our
deeds
to
the
two
acres
there
is
a
clause
which
reserves
a
for
the
king
the
deed
is
worded
like
the
old
lease
that
dates
back
to
and
so
one
day
we
may
have
to
give
a
king
a
through
our
garden
if
france
becomes
a
monarchy
again
anyone
who
knows
french
people
at
all
knows
how
dearly
they
cherish
the
dream
of
a
monarchy
illustration
the
broad
terrace
connects
house
and
garden
one
of
the
small
houses
we
found
on
our
small
estate
had
once
been
a
part
of
the
of
marie
antoinette
we
have
had
this
little
house
rebuilt
and
connected
with
the
villa
and
now
use
it
as
a
guest
house
it
is
very
charming
with
its
walls
covered
with
lattices
and
ivy
villa
trianon
like
most
french
houses
is
built
directly
on
the
street
leaving
all
the
space
possible
for
the
garden
the
façade
of
the
villa
is
very
simple
it
reminds
you
of
the
square
houses
of
the
american
colonial
period
except
that
there
is
no
front
porch
as
is
inevitable
with
us
in
america
the
entrance
gate
and
the
stone
wall
that
surround
the
place
give
an
interest
that
our
detached
and
hastily
built
american
houses
lack
the
wall
is
really
a
continuation
of
the
façade
of
the
villa
and
is
surmounted
by
a
black
iron
railing
vines
and
flowers
that
have
flourished
and
died
and
flourished
again
for
over
a
century
climb
over
the
wall
and
through
the
graceful
railing
and
give
our
home
an
air
of
permanence
that
is
very
satisfying
after
all
that
is
the
secret
of
europe
fascination
for
us
americans
the
suggestion
of
permanence
we
feel
that
houses
and
gardens
were
planned
and
built
for
centuries
not
for
the
passing
pleasure
of
one
brief
lifetime
we
people
them
with
ghosts
that
please
us
and
make
histories
for
them
that
are
always
romantic
and
full
of
happiness
the
survival
of
an
old
house
and
its
garden
through
centuries
of
use
and
misuse
is
always
an
impressive
and
dramatic
discovery
to
us
it
gives
us
courage
to
add
our
little
bit
to
the
ultimate
beauty
and
history
it
gives
us
excuse
to
dream
of
the
fortunate
people
who
will
follow
us
in
other
centuries
and
who
will
in
turn
bless
us
for
our
part
in
the
remaking
of
one
old
house
and
garden
there
was
much
to
do
we
hardly
knew
where
to
begin
the
house
was
in
such
wretched
condition
the
roof
was
falling
in
and
the
debris
of
years
was
piled
high
inside
but
the
walls
and
the
floors
were
still
very
beautiful
and
as
sound
as
ever
structurally
we
had
the
roof
restored
the
debris
removed
and
the
underbrush
weeded
out
of
the
garden
and
then
we
were
ready
to
begin
the
real
business
of
restoration
the
house
is
very
simply
planned
there
is
a
broad
hall
that
runs
straight
through
it
with
and
servants
hall
on
the
right
and
four
connecting
salons
on
the
left
these
salons
are
charming
rooms
with
beautiful
panelings
and
and
great
arches
framed
in
delicate
carvings
first
comes
the
then
the
library
then
the
large
and
small
salons
the
rooms
opening
on
the
back
of
the
house
have
long
french
windows
that
open
directly
upon
the
terrace
where
we
have
most
of
our
meals
the
note
of
the
interior
of
the
house
is
blue
and
there
are
masses
of
blue
flowers
in
the
garden
the
interior
woodwork
is
cream
pointed
with
blue
and
there
are
blues
innumerable
in
the
rugs
and
curtains
and
there
must
be
a
hundred
different
shades
of
blue
on
this
i
think
we
have
tried
to
restore
the
rooms
to
a
louis
xv
scheme
of
decoration
the
tables
and
cabinets
are
of
the
fine
polished
woods
of
the
period
some
of
the
chairs
are
roomy
affairs
of
carved
and
painted
wooden
frames
and
brocade
coverings
but
others
are
modern
easychairs
covered
in
new
linens
of
old
designs
linens
that
were
designed
for
just
such
interiors
when
oberkampf
first
began
his
designing
at
jouy
the
mirrors
and
are
of
course
designed
to
harmonize
with
the
carvings
of
the
woodwork
monsieur
de
nolhac
and
sardou
were
most
helpful
to
us
when
such
architectural
problems
had
to
be
solved
we
have
not
used
the
extravagant
lace
curtains
that
seem
to
go
with
brocades
and
carvings
because
we
are
modern
enough
not
to
believe
in
lace
curtains
and
we
find
that
the
thin
white
muslin
ones
give
our
brocades
and
tapestries
a
chance
to
assert
their
decorative
importance
somehow
lace
curtains
give
a
room
such
a
air
that
they
quite
spoil
the
effect
of
beautiful
fabrics
we
have
a
few
fine
old
savonnerie
carpets
that
are
very
much
at
home
in
this
house
and
so
many
interesting
eighteenth
century
prints
we
hardly
know
how
to
use
them
our
bedrooms
are
very
simple
with
their
white
panelings
and
chintz
hangings
we
have
furnished
them
with
graceful
and
feminine
things
delicately
carved
mirror
frames
and
inlaid
tables
painted
beds
and
chests
of
drawers
of
rosewood
or
satinwood
we
feel
that
the
ghosts
of
the
fair
ladies
who
live
in
the
park
would
adore
the
bedrooms
and
rejoice
in
the
strange
magic
of
electric
lights
if
the
ghosts
should
be
confronted
with
the
electric
lights
their
surprise
would
not
be
greater
than
was
the
consternation
of
our
builders
when
we
demanded
five
bathrooms
they
were
astounded
and
assured
us
it
was
not
necessary
it
was
not
possible
indeed
it
seemed
that
it
was
hardly
legal
to
give
one
small
french
house
five
american
bathrooms
we
fought
the
matter
out
and
got
them
however
we
determined
to
make
the
house
seem
a
part
of
the
garden
and
so
we
built
a
broad
terrace
across
the
rear
of
the
villa
you
step
directly
from
the
long
windows
of
the
salon
and
upon
the
terrace
and
before
you
is
spread
out
our
little
garden
and
back
of
that
through
an
opening
in
the
trees
a
view
of
the
château
our
source
of
inspiration
the
terrace
is
built
of
tiles
on
a
cement
foundation
vines
are
trained
over
square
frames
of
wire
erected
at
regular
intervals
between
the
edge
of
the
terrace
and
the
smooth
green
lawn
there
is
a
mass
of
blue
flowers
we
have
a
number
of
willow
chairs
and
old
stone
tables
here
and
you
can
appreciate
the
joy
of
having
breakfast
and
tea
on
the
terrace
with
the
birds
singing
in
the
boughs
of
the
trees
i
have
written
at
length
in
the
other
chapters
of
my
ideas
of
and
in
this
one
i
want
to
give
you
my
ideas
of
garden
guilding
true
we
had
the
old
garden
plan
to
work
from
and
trees
two
hundred
years
old
and
old
walls
who
could
accomplish
a
perfect
garden
with
such
essentials
people
said
well
it
was
so
easy
as
it
seems
you
can
select
furnishings
for
a
room
with
fair
success
because
you
can
see
and
feel
textures
and
colors
and
the
lines
of
the
furniture
and
curtains
but
gardens
are
different
you
can
not
make
grass
and
flowers
grow
just
so
on
short
notice
you
plant
and
dig
and
plant
again
before
things
grow
as
you
have
visualized
them
there
was
a
double
ring
of
trees
in
one
corner
of
our
domain
enclosing
the
de
or
outdoor
in
the
center
of
this
enchanted
circle
there
was
a
statue
by
clodion
a
joyous
nymph
holding
a
baby
faun
in
her
arms
there
were
several
old
stone
benches
under
the
trees
that
must
have
known
the
secrets
of
the
famous
ladies
of
the
eighteenth
century
courts
the
de
looked
just
as
it
did
when
the
little
daughters
of
louis
xv
came
here
to
have
their
afternoon
cakes
and
tea
so
we
did
not
try
to
change
this
bit
of
our
garden
my
idea
of
making
over
the
place
was
to
leave
the
part
of
the
garden
against
the
stone
walls
in
the
rear
in
its
tangled
woodsy
state
and
to
build
against
it
a
trellis
that
would
be
in
line
with
the
terrace
between
the
trellis
and
the
terrace
there
was
to
be
a
smooth
expanse
of
greensward
bordered
with
flowers
it
seemed
very
simple
but
i
hereby
confess
that
i
built
and
tore
down
the
trellis
three
times
before
it
pleased
me
i
had
to
make
it
worthy
of
the
statue
by
pradier
that
was
given
us
by
sardou
and
finally
it
was
done
to
please
me
painted
a
soft
green
with
ivy
growing
over
it
and
a
fountain
flanked
by
white
marbles
outlined
against
it
this
trellis
represents
to
me
at
least
my
best
work
the
occupies
the
greater
part
of
the
garden
and
it
is
bordered
by
gravel
walks
bordered
in
turn
with
white
flowerbeds
between
the
walks
and
the
walls
there
are
the
groups
of
trees
the
statues
with
green
spaces
about
them
the
masses
of
evergreen
trees
and
finally
the
great
trees
that
follow
the
lines
of
the
wall
indeed
the
is
like
the
arena
of
an
ample
theater
with
the
ascending
flowers
and
shrubs
and
trees
representing
the
ascending
tiers
of
seats
one
feels
that
all
the
trees
and
flowers
look
down
upon
the
central
stretch
of
greensward
and
perhaps
there
is
a
fairy
ring
here
where
plays
take
place
by
night
nothing
is
impossible
in
this
garden
certainly
the
fairies
play
in
the
enchanted
ring
of
the
trees
of
the
de
we
are
convinced
of
that
so
formal
is
the
with
its
blossoming
borders
of
larkspur
and
daisies
and
its
tall
standard
roses
you
are
surprised
to
find
that
that
part
of
the
garden
outside
this
prim
rectangle
has
mysteries
there
are
winding
paths
that
terminate
in
marble
seats
there
is
the
a
little
house
built
for
outdoor
musicales
with
electric
connections
that
make
breakfast
and
tea
possible
here
there
is
the
guest
house
and
the
motor
house
quite
as
interesting
as
any
other
part
of
the
garden
and
everywhere
there
are
blue
and
white
and
flowers
planted
in
great
masses
against
the
evergreens
we
leave
america
early
in
june
tired
out
with
the
breathless
business
of
living
and
find
ourselves
in
our
house
and
garden
we
fall
asleep
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
tiny
piping
of
the
little
people
in
bur
garden
we
awake
to
the
matins
of
the
birds
we
breakfast
on
the
stone
terrace
with
boughs
of
trees
and
clouds
for
our
roof
and
as
we
look
out
over
the
masses
of
blue
flowers
and
the
smooth
green
over
the
arched
trelliage
with
its
fountains
and
its
marbles
the
great
trees
back
of
our
domain
frame
the
supremely
beautiful
towers
of
the
château
le
magnificent
and
we
are
far
happier
than
anyone
deserves
to
be
in
this
wicked
world
xx
notes
on
many
things
a
little
talk
on
clocks
the
selection
of
proper
clocks
for
one
house
is
always
a
pursuit
of
real
pleasure
clocks
are
such
necessary
things
the
thoughtless
woman
is
apt
to
compromise
when
she
does
find
exactly
the
right
one
how
much
wiser
and
happier
she
would
be
if
she
decided
to
depend
upon
an
ordinary
alarm
clock
until
the
proper
clock
was
discovered
if
she
made
a
hobby
of
her
quest
for
clocks
she
would
find
much
amusement
many
other
valuable
objects
and
finally
exactly
the
right
clocks
for
her
rooms
everyone
knows
the
merits
and
demerits
of
the
hundreds
of
clocks
of
commerce
and
it
is
for
me
to
go
into
the
subject
of
bracket
clocks
and
banjo
clocks
when
there
are
so
many
excellent
books
on
the
subject
i
plead
for
the
graceful
clocks
of
old
france
the
so
lovingly
designed
by
the
master
sculptors
of
the
eighteenth
century
i
plead
particularly
for
the
wall
clocks
that
are
so
conspicuous
in
all
good
french
houses
and
so
unusual
in
our
own
country
illustration
a
proper
in
the
just
as
surely
as
our
fine
old
english
and
american
clocks
have
their
proper
niches
so
the
french
clocks
belong
inevitably
in
certain
rooms
you
may
never
find
just
the
proper
clock
for
this
room
but
that
is
your
fault
there
are
hundreds
of
lovely
old
models
available
why
some
manufacturer
have
them
reproduced
i
feel
that
if
women
generally
knew
how
very
decorative
and
distinguished
a
good
wall
clock
may
be
the
demand
would
soon
create
a
supply
of
these
beautiful
objects
it
would
be
quite
simple
for
the
manufacturers
to
make
them
from
the
old
models
the
late
pierpont
morgan
gave
to
the
metropolitan
museum
the
magnificent
hoentschel
collection
of
hoping
to
stimulate
the
interest
of
american
designers
and
artisans
in
the
fine
models
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
there
are
some
very
fine
examples
of
wall
clocks
in
this
collection
which
might
be
copied
in
carved
wood
by
the
students
of
manual
training
schools
if
the
manufacturers
refuse
to
be
interested
wall
clocks
first
came
into
france
in
the
early
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
are
a
part
of
the
furnishing
of
all
the
fine
old
french
houses
a
number
of
the
most
interesting
clocks
i
have
picked
up
were
the
wooden
models
which
served
for
the
fine
bronze
clocks
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
master
designer
first
worked
out
his
idea
in
wood
before
making
the
clock
in
bronze
and
the
wooden
models
were
sold
for
a
song
i
have
one
of
these
clocks
in
my
it
is
as
much
a
part
of
the
wall
decoration
as
the
lights
or
the
mirrors
the
wall
clocks
i
like
best
are
fixed
directly
on
the
wall
the
dial
glass
opening
so
that
the
clock
may
be
wound
with
a
key
you
will
notice
such
a
clock
in
the
photograph
of
one
of
my
this
fine
old
clock
is
given
the
place
of
honor
in
the
main
panel
of
the
wall
above
the
console
table
i
often
use
such
a
clock
in
a
just
as
i
use
the
fine
old
french
mantel
clocks
in
my
you
will
observe
a
very
quaint
example
of
the
empire
period
in
the
illustration
of
my
mantel
this
clock
is
happily
placed
for
the
marble
of
the
mantel
the
near
by
and
the
fine
little
bronze
busts
are
all
in
key
with
the
exquisite
workmanship
of
the
clock
in
another
room
in
my
house
a
bedroom
there
is
a
beautiful
little
french
clock
that
is
the
only
object
allowed
on
the
mantel
shelf
the
beautiful
carving
of
the
mirror
frame
back
of
it
seems
a
part
of
the
clock
a
deliberate
background
for
it
this
is
one
of
the
many
wall
clocks
which
were
known
as
bracket
clocks
the
bracket
being
as
carefully
designed
and
carved
as
the
clock
itself
most
of
the
clocks
we
see
nowadays
grew
out
of
the
old
bracket
models
the
american
clockmakers
of
the
eighteenth
century
made
many
of
those
jolly
little
wall
clocks
called
these
clocks
may
be
still
picked
up
in
towns
in
construction
they
are
very
much
like
the
old
cuckoo
clock
which
has
come
to
us
from
switzerland
and
the
tile
clock
which
comes
from
holland
these
clocks
with
long
exposed
weights
and
pendulum
have
not
the
dignity
of
the
french
wall
clocks
which
were
as
complete
in
themselves
as
fine
and
of
even
greater
decorative
importance
every
room
in
my
house
has
its
clock
and
to
me
these
magic
little
instruments
have
an
almost
human
interest
they
seem
always
friendly
to
me
whether
they
mark
off
the
hours
that
weigh
so
heavily
and
seem
or
the
happy
hours
that
go
all
too
quickly
i
love
clocks
so
much
myself
that
it
always
astonishes
me
to
go
into
a
room
where
there
is
none
or
if
there
is
it
is
one
of
those
abortive
exaggerated
gilded
clocks
that
are
falsely
labeled
french
and
sold
at
a
great
price
in
the
shops
somehow
one
never
expects
a
clock
of
this
kind
to
keep
time
it
is
bought
as
an
ornament
and
if
it
runs
at
all
it
wheezes
or
gasps
or
makes
a
dreadful
noise
and
invariably
stops
at
three
i
am
such
a
crank
about
good
clocks
that
i
take
my
own
with
me
even
on
a
railway
train
i
think
i
have
the
smallest
clock
in
the
world
which
strikes
the
hours
there
are
many
tiny
clocks
made
which
strike
if
one
touches
a
spring
but
my
clock
always
strikes
of
itself
cartier
who
designed
and
made
this
extraordinary
timepiece
assures
me
that
he
has
never
seen
so
small
a
clock
which
strikes
it
is
very
pleasant
to
have
this
little
clock
with
its
friendly
chime
with
me
when
i
am
in
some
desolate
hotel
or
some
strange
house
there
are
traveling
clocks
in
small
leather
cases
which
can
be
bought
very
cheaply
indeed
now
and
one
of
these
clocks
should
be
a
part
of
everyone
traveling
equipment
the
humble
nickeled
watch
with
a
leather
case
is
infinitely
better
than
the
pretentious
clocks
monstrosities
of
marble
and
brass
and
bad
taste
a
corner
for
writing
one
of
my
greatest
pleasures
when
i
am
planning
the
furnishing
of
a
house
is
the
selection
and
equipment
of
the
necessary
every
room
in
every
house
has
its
own
suggestion
for
an
original
treatment
and
i
enjoy
working
out
a
plan
for
a
that
will
offer
maximum
of
convenience
and
beauty
and
charm
for
in
these
busy
days
we
need
all
these
qualities
for
the
inspiration
of
a
pleasant
note
you
see
i
believe
in
proper
just
as
i
believe
in
proper
chairs
i
have
so
many
desks
in
my
own
house
that
are
in
constant
use
perhaps
i
can
give
you
my
theory
best
by
recording
my
actual
practice
of
it
i
have
spoken
of
the
necessity
of
a
desk
in
the
hallway
and
indeed
i
have
said
much
of
desks
in
other
rooms
but
i
have
still
to
emphasize
my
belief
in
the
importance
of
the
equipment
of
desks
of
course
one
needs
a
desk
in
one
own
room
here
there
is
infinite
latitude
for
there
are
dozens
of
delightful
possibilities
i
always
place
my
desks
near
the
windows
if
the
wall
space
is
filled
i
place
an
oblong
table
at
right
angles
to
a
window
and
there
you
are
in
my
own
private
i
have
a
long
desk
so
placed
in
my
own
house
in
a
i
furnished
recently
i
used
a
common
oblong
table
of
no
value
painting
the
legs
a
soft
green
and
covering
it
with
a
piece
of
damask
this
is
one
of
the
nicest
i
know
and
it
could
be
copied
for
a
song
the
equipment
of
it
is
what
counts
i
used
two
lamps
dull
green
jars
with
mauve
silk
shades
a
dark
green
leather
rack
for
paper
and
envelopes
and
a
great
blotter
pad
that
will
save
the
damask
from
the
small
things
are
of
green
pottery
and
crystal
in
a
young
girl
bedroom
i
used
a
sweet
little
desk
of
painted
wood
a
desk
that
has
the
naïve
charm
of
innocence
i
do
hope
it
inspires
the
proper
i
always
make
provision
for
writing
in
a
sliding
shelf
in
the
and
a
shallow
drawer
for
pencils
and
paper
and
i
have
adequate
writing
facilities
in
the
servants
quarters
so
that
there
may
be
no
excuse
for
forgetting
orders
or
messages
this
seems
to
me
absolutely
necessary
in
our
modern
domestic
routine
it
is
part
of
the
business
principle
we
borrow
from
the
efficient
office
routine
of
our
men
folk
the
and
the
bathrooms
are
the
only
places
where
the
in
one
form
or
another
is
required
i
like
the
long
flat
tables
or
small
desks
much
better
than
the
huge
affairs
or
the
heavy
desks
built
after
the
fashion
of
the
old
if
the
room
is
large
enough
a
secretary
after
an
eighteenth
century
model
will
be
a
beautiful
and
distinguished
piece
of
furniture
i
have
such
a
secretary
in
my
own
a
chest
of
drawers
surmounted
by
a
cabinet
of
shelves
with
glass
doors
but
i
do
not
use
it
as
a
desk
i
use
the
shelves
for
my
old
china
and
porcelains
and
the
drawers
for
pamphlets
and
the
thousand
and
one
things
that
are
too
flimsily
bound
for
bookshelves
of
course
if
one
has
a
large
correspondence
and
uses
one
home
as
an
office
it
is
better
to
have
a
large
desk
with
a
top
which
closes
i
prefer
tables
and
i
have
them
made
big
enough
to
hold
all
my
papers
big
enough
to
spread
out
on
there
are
dozens
of
enchanting
small
desks
that
are
exactly
right
for
the
extremely
feminine
desks
that
come
from
old
france
one
of
the
most
fascinating
ones
is
copied
from
a
de
that
belonged
to
marie
antoinette
in
those
days
the
writing
of
letters
and
the
making
of
a
toilet
went
together
this
old
desk
has
a
drawer
filled
with
compartments
for
toilet
things
powders
and
perfumes
and
patches
and
above
this
there
is
the
usual
shelf
for
writing
and
compartments
for
paper
and
letters
the
desk
itself
suggests
brocade
flounces
and
powdered
hair
so
exquisitely
is
it
constructed
of
tulipwood
and
inlaid
with
other
woods
of
many
colors
then
there
are
the
small
desks
made
by
modern
just
large
enough
to
hold
a
a
paper
rack
and
a
pair
of
candlesticks
there
is
always
a
shallow
drawer
for
writing
materials
such
a
desk
may
be
decorated
to
match
the
chintzes
of
any
small
bedroom
if
it
is
possible
for
you
to
have
a
desk
in
each
there
should
be
a
little
somewhere
apart
from
the
family
if
you
live
in
one
of
those
houses
intersected
by
great
halls
with
much
wasted
space
on
the
upper
floors
you
may
make
a
little
of
one
of
the
and
screen
it
from
the
rest
of
the
hall
with
a
high
standing
screen
if
you
have
a
house
of
the
other
extreme
type
a
city
house
with
little
hall
bedrooms
use
one
of
these
little
rooms
for
a
you
will
require
a
desk
well
stocked
with
stationery
and
all
the
things
the
writer
will
need
a
shelf
of
address
books
and
reference
books
with
a
dictionary
of
course
many
pens
and
pencils
and
fresh
blotters
and
so
forth
of
course
you
may
have
ever
so
many
more
things
but
it
is
necessary
better
a
quiet
corner
with
one
chair
and
a
desk
than
the
elaborate
library
with
its
superb
fittings
where
people
come
and
go
given
the
proper
desk
the
furnishing
of
it
is
most
important
the
should
be
heavy
enough
to
keep
its
place
and
the
should
be
constantly
renewed
i
know
of
nothing
more
offensive
than
dusty
there
are
very
good
sets
to
be
had
now
made
of
brass
bronze
carved
wood
porcelain
silver
or
crystal
and
there
are
leather
boxes
for
holding
stationery
and
leather
portfolios
to
be
had
in
all
colors
i
always
add
to
these
furnishings
a
good
pair
of
scissors
stationery
marked
with
the
house
address
or
the
monogram
of
the
person
to
whom
the
desk
especially
belongs
an
almanac
and
a
my
pincushions
are
as
much
a
part
of
the
equipment
of
a
desk
as
the
writing
things
and
they
frilly
ugly
things
they
are
covered
with
brocade
or
damask
or
some
stuff
used
elsewhere
in
the
room
and
i
assure
you
they
are
most
useful
i
find
that
pins
are
almost
as
necessary
as
pens
in
my
correspondence
they
are
much
more
expedient
than
in
country
houses
i
think
it
shows
forethought
and
adds
greatly
to
the
comfort
of
the
guests
to
have
a
small
framed
card
showing
the
arrival
and
departure
of
trains
and
of
mails
especially
if
the
house
is
a
great
distance
from
the
this
saves
much
inquiry
and
time
in
the
paper
rack
there
should
be
not
only
stamped
paper
bearing
the
address
of
the
house
telephone
number
and
so
forth
but
also
telegraph
blanks
post
cards
stamps
and
so
forth
very
often
people
who
have
beautiful
places
have
post
cards
made
showing
various
views
of
the
house
and
garden
test
the
efficiency
of
your
occasionally
by
using
them
yourself
this
is
the
only
way
to
be
sure
of
the
success
of
anything
in
your
house
try
it
yourself
stools
and
benches
i
often
wonder
when
i
grope
my
way
through
crowded
and
jammed
with
chairs
and
sofas
why
more
women
do
not
realize
the
advantages
of
stools
and
benches
a
stool
is
doubly
useful
it
may
be
used
to
sit
upon
or
it
may
be
used
to
hold
a
tray
or
whatever
you
please
it
is
really
preferable
to
a
small
table
because
it
is
not
always
full
of
a
nondescript
collection
of
ornaments
which
seems
to
be
the
fate
of
all
small
tables
it
has
also
the
advantage
of
being
low
enough
to
push
under
a
large
table
when
need
be
and
it
occupies
much
less
space
than
a
chair
apparently
not
actually
because
it
has
no
back
i
have
stools
or
benches
or
both
in
all
my
rooms
because
i
find
them
convenient
and
easily
moved
about
but
i
have
noticed
an
amusing
thing
whenever
a
fat
man
comes
to
see
me
he
always
sits
on
the
smallest
stool
in
the
room
i
have
many
fat
friends
and
many
stools
but
invariably
the
fattest
man
gravitates
to
the
smallest
stool
the
stools
i
like
best
for
the
are
the
fine
old
ones
covered
with
needlework
or
brocade
but
there
are
many
simpler
ones
of
plain
wood
with
cane
insets
that
are
very
good
for
other
rooms
then
there
are
the
long
or
benches
which
are
so
nice
in
and
hallways
and
nicest
of
all
in
a
ballroom
indeed
a
ballroom
needs
no
other
movable
furniture
given
plenty
of
these
long
benches
they
may
be
of
the
very
simplest
description
but
when
used
in
a
fine
room
should
be
covered
with
a
good
damask
or
velvet
or
some
rich
fabric
i
have
a
fine
eighteenth
century
in
my
the
frame
being
carved
and
gilded
and
the
seat
covered
with
venetian
red
velvet
you
will
find
these
gilded
stools
all
over
england
there
are
a
number
at
hampton
court
palace
at
hardwick
there
are
both
long
and
short
stools
carved
with
the
dolphin
scroll
and
covered
with
elaborate
stuffs
the
older
the
english
house
the
more
stools
are
in
evidence
in
the
early
sixteenth
century
joint
stools
were
used
in
every
room
in
the
bedrooms
they
served
the
purposes
of
small
tables
and
chairs
as
well
there
are
ever
so
many
fine
old
walnut
stools
and
the
lower
stools
used
for
to
be
bought
in
london
shops
that
make
a
specialty
of
old
english
furniture
and
reproductions
of
them
may
be
bought
in
the
better
american
shops
i
often
wonder
why
we
do
not
see
more
bedside
stools
they
are
so
convenient
even
though
the
bed
be
only
moderately
high
from
the
floor
many
of
mine
are
only
six
inches
high
about
the
height
of
a
fat
floor
cushion
illustration
a
porcelain
stove
in
a
new
york
house
which
reminds
me
the
floor
cushion
made
of
the
same
velvet
made
for
carpeting
is
a
modern
luxury
we
ca
afford
to
ignore
lately
i
have
seen
such
beautiful
ones
about
three
feet
long
and
one
foot
wide
covered
with
tapestry
with
great
gold
tassels
at
the
corners
the
possibilities
of
the
floor
cushion
idea
are
limitless
they
take
the
place
of
the
usual
footstool
in
front
of
the
boudoir
easy
chair
or
beside
the
day
bed
or
or
beside
the
large
bed
for
that
matter
they
are
no
longer
unsanitary
because
with
vacuum
cleaners
they
may
be
kept
as
clean
as
chair
cushions
they
may
be
made
to
fit
into
almost
any
room
i
saw
a
half
dozen
of
them
in
a
recently
small
square
hard
ones
covered
with
the
gold
colored
velvet
of
the
carpet
they
were
not
more
than
four
or
five
inches
thick
but
that
is
the
ideal
height
for
an
cushion
try
it
porcelain
stoves
when
the
colony
club
was
at
last
finished
we
discovered
that
the
furnace
heat
did
not
go
up
to
the
and
immediately
we
had
to
find
some
way
of
heating
this
very
attractive
and
very
necessary
space
even
from
the
beginning
we
were
sadly
crowded
for
room
so
popular
was
the
and
the
was
much
needed
for
the
overflow
we
conferred
with
architects
builders
and
plumbers
and
found
it
would
be
necessary
to
spend
about
seven
thousand
dollars
and
to
close
the
club
for
about
two
months
in
order
to
carry
the
heating
arrangements
up
to
the
roof
this
was
disastrous
for
a
new
club
already
heavily
in
arrears
and
running
under
heavy
expenses
i
worried
and
worried
over
the
situation
and
suddenly
one
night
an
idea
came
to
me
i
remembered
some
great
porcelain
stoves
i
had
seen
in
germany
i
felt
that
these
stoves
were
exactly
what
we
needed
and
that
we
should
be
rescued
from
an
embarrassing
situation
without
much
trouble
or
expense
i
was
just
leaving
for
europe
so
i
hurried
on
to
the
manufacturers
of
these
wonderful
stoves
and
found
after
much
difficulty
a
model
that
seemed
practicable
and
not
too
huge
in
proportion
the
model
unfortunately
was
white
with
gilded
garlands
far
too
french
and
magnificent
for
our
i
persuaded
them
to
make
two
of
the
stoves
for
me
in
green
majolica
with
garlands
of
flowers
and
finally
we
achieved
just
the
stoves
for
the
room
but
my
troubles
were
not
over
when
the
stoves
reached
new
york
we
tried
to
take
them
up
to
the
roof
and
found
them
too
large
for
the
stairs
we
could
have
them
lifted
up
by
pulleys
because
the
glass
walls
of
the
roof
garden
and
the
fretwork
at
the
top
of
the
roof
made
it
impossible
for
the
men
to
get
purchase
for
their
pulleys
finally
we
persuaded
a
gentleman
who
lived
next
door
to
let
us
take
them
over
the
roof
of
his
house
and
the
deed
was
accomplished
the
stoves
were
equal
to
the
occasion
they
heated
the
roof
garden
perfectly
and
were
of
great
decorative
value
encouraged
by
this
success
i
purchased
another
porcelain
stove
this
time
a
porcelain
one
and
used
it
in
a
hallway
in
an
uptown
house
it
was
the
one
thing
needed
to
give
the
hall
great
distinction
since
then
i
have
used
a
number
of
these
stoves
and
i
wonder
why
our
american
manufacturers
do
not
make
them
they
are
admirable
for
heating
difficult
rooms
outdoor
porches
and
draughty
halls
and
rooms
not
heated
by
furnaces
the
stoves
are
becoming
harder
and
harder
to
find
though
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
purchase
one
last
year
from
the
marchioness
of
anglesey
who
was
giving
up
her
home
at
versailles
this
stove
was
of
white
majolica
with
little
loves
in
terra
cotta
adorning
it
the
new
ones
are
less
attractive
but
it
would
be
perfectly
simple
to
have
any
tile
manufacturer
copy
an
old
one
given
the
design
the
charm
of
indoor
fountains
wall
fountains
as
we
know
them
are
introduced
into
our
modern
houses
for
their
decorative
interest
and
for
the
joy
they
give
us
the
joyous
sound
and
color
of
falling
water
we
use
them
because
they
are
beautiful
and
cheerful
but
originally
they
had
a
most
definite
purpose
they
were
built
into
the
walls
of
the
in
medieval
times
and
used
for
washing
the
precious
plate
if
you
look
into
the
history
of
any
you
will
find
that
it
was
first
used
for
a
purpose
all
the
superb
masterly
things
that
have
come
to
us
had
logical
beginnings
it
has
remained
for
the
thoughtless
designer
of
our
times
to
produce
things
of
no
use
and
no
meaning
the
old
designers
decorated
the
small
objects
of
daily
use
as
faithfully
as
they
decorated
the
greater
things
the
wall
spaces
and
ceilings
and
great
pieces
of
furniture
and
so
this
little
wall
basin
which
began
in
such
a
homely
way
soon
became
a
beautiful
thing
europe
has
countless
small
fountains
built
for
interior
walls
and
for
small
alcoves
and
indoor
conservatories
but
we
are
just
beginning
to
use
them
in
america
american
sculptors
are
doing
such
notable
work
however
that
we
shall
soon
plan
our
indoor
fountains
as
carefully
as
we
plan
our
fireplaces
the
fact
that
our
houses
are
heated
mechanically
has
not
lessened
our
appreciation
of
an
open
fire
and
running
water
brought
indoors
has
the
same
animate
charm

i
am
showing
a
picture
of
the
wall
fountain
in
the
entrance
hall
of
my
own
new
york
house
in
east
street
i
have
had
this
wall
fountain
built
as
part
of
the
architectural
detail
of
the
room
with
a
background
of
paneled
mirrors
it
spills
over
into
a
marble
curbed
pool
where
fat
goldfish
live
i
keep
the
fountain
banked
with
flowers
you
can
imagine
the
pleasure
of
leaving
the
dusty
city
streets
and
entering
this
cool
pleasant
entrance
hall
our
modern
use
of
indoor
fountains
is
perfectly
legitimate
we
use
them
to
bring
the
atmosphere
of
outdoors
in
in
country
houses
we
use
fountains
in
our
gardens
but
in
the
city
we
have
no
gardens
and
so
we
are
very
wise
to
bring
in
the
outdoor
things
that
make
our
lives
a
little
more
gay
and
informal
the
more
suggestive
of
the
happier
is
the
effect
of
the
sun
room
occasionally
one
sees
a
rare
house
where
a
glass
enclosed
garden
opens
from
one
of
the
there
is
a
house
in
nineteenth
street
that
has
such
an
enclosed
garden
built
around
a
wall
fountain
the
garden
opens
out
of
the
great
lofty
windows
flank
a
great
door
and
fill
the
end
of
the
room
with
a
luminous
composition
of
leaded
glass
through
the
door
you
enter
the
garden
with
its
tiled
floor
its
glass
ceiling
and
its
low
brick
retaining
walls
the
wall
fountain
is
placed
exactly
in
front
of
the
great
door
and
beneath
it
there
is
a
little
pool
bordered
with
plants
and
glittering
with
goldfish
evergreens
are
banked
against
the
brick
walls
and
flat
reliefs
are
hung
just
under
the
glass
ceiling
the
garden
is
quite
small
but
takes
its
place
as
an
important
part
of
the
room
it
rivals
in
interest
the
massive
gothic
fireplace
with
its
huge
logs
and
feudal
fire
irons
the
better
silversmiths
are
doing
much
to
encourage
the
development
of
indoor
fountains
they
display
the
delightful
fountains
of
our
young
american
sculptors
fountains
that
would
make
any
garden
room
notable
there
are
so
many
of
these
small
bronze
fountains
with
pan
piping
his
irresistible
tune
of
outdoors
children
playing
with
frogs
or
geese
or
lizards
or
turtles
gay
little
figures
prancing
in
enchanted
rings
of
friendly
beasties
why
do
we
make
use
of
them
