legends
of
vancouver
by
pauline
johnson
tekahionwake
preface
i
have
been
asked
to
write
a
preface
to
these
legends
of
vancouver
which
in
conjunction
with
the
members
of
the
publication
lefevre
makovski
and
douglas
i
have
helped
to
put
through
the
press
but
scarcely
any
prefatory
remarks
are
necessary
this
book
may
well
stand
on
its
own
merits
still
it
may
be
permissible
to
record
one
glad
satisfaction
that
a
poet
has
arisen
to
cast
over
the
shoulders
of
our
grey
mountains
our
forests
our
waters
and
the
streets
and
of
our
hurrying
city
a
gracious
mantle
of
romance
pauline
johnson
has
linked
the
vivid
present
with
the
immemorial
past
vancouver
takes
on
a
new
aspect
as
we
view
it
through
her
eyes
in
the
imaginative
power
that
she
has
brought
to
these
sagas
and
in
the
liquid
flow
of
her
rhythmical
prose
she
has
shown
herself
to
be
a
literary
worker
of
whom
we
may
well
be
proud
she
has
made
a
most
estimable
contribution
to
purely
canadian
literature

author
foreword
these
legends
with
two
or
three
exceptions
were
told
to
me
personally
by
my
honored
friend
the
late
chief
joe
capilano
of
vancouver
whom
i
had
the
privilege
of
first
meeting
in
london
in
when
he
visited
england
and
was
received
at
buckingham
palace
by
their
majesties
king
edward
vii
and
queen
alexandra
to
the
fact
that
i
was
able
to
greet
chief
capilano
in
the
chinook
tongue
while
we
were
both
many
thousands
of
miles
from
home
i
owe
the
friendship
and
the
confidence
which
he
so
freely
gave
me
when
i
came
to
reside
on
the
pacific
coast
these
legends
he
told
me
from
time
to
time
just
as
the
mood
possessed
him
and
he
frequently
remarked
that
they
had
never
been
revealed
to
any
other
person
save
myself

is
the

head
chief
of
the
six
nations
indians
and
his

emily
howells
the

was
of
english

her
birthplace

bristol
but
the
land
of
her
adoption
canada
chief
johnson
was
of
the
renowned
mohawk
tribe
being
a
scion
of
one
of
the
fifty
noble
families
which
composed
the
historical
confederation
founded
by
hiawatha
upwards
of
four
hundred
years
ago
and
known
at
that
period
as
the
brotherhood
of
the
five
nations
but
which
was
afterwards
named
the
iroquois
by
the
early
french
missionaries
and
explorers
for
their
loyalty
to
the
british
crown
they
were
granted
the
magnificent
lands
bordering
the
grand
river
in
the
county
of
brant
ontario
on
which
the
tribes
still
live
it
was
upon
this
reserve
on
her
father
estate
chiefswood
that
pauline
johnson
was
born
the
loyalty
of
her
ancestors
breathes
in
her
prose
as
well
as
in
her
poetic
writings
her
education
was
neither
extensive
nor
elaborate
it
embraced
neither
high
school
nor
college
a
nursery
governess
for
two
years
at
home
three
years
at
an
indian
day
school
half
a
mile
from
her
home
and
two
years
in
the
central
school
of
the
city
of
brantford
was
the
extent
of
her
educational
training
but
besides
this
she
acquired
a
wide
general
knowledge
having
been
through
childhood
and
early
girlhood
a
great
reader
especially
of
poetry
before
she
was
twelve
years
old
she
had
read
scott
longfellow
byron
shakespeare
and
such
books
as
addison
spectator
foster
essays
and
owen
meredith
writings
the
first
periodicals
to
accept
her
poems
and
place
them
before
the
public
were
gems
of
poetry
a
small
magazine
published
in
new
york
and
the
week
established
by
the
late
goldwin
smith
of
toronto
the
new
york
independent
and
toronto
saturday
night
since
then
she
has
contributed
to
most
of
the
magazines
both
on
this
continent
and
england
her
writings
having
brought
her
into
notice
the
next
step
in
miss
johnson
career
was
her
appearance
on
the
public
platform
as
a
reciter
of
her
own
poems
for
this
she
had
natural
talent
and
in
the
exercise
of
it
she
soon
developed
a
marked
ability
joined
with
a
personal
magnetism
that
was
destined
to
make
her
a
favorite
with
audiences
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
her
friend
frank
yeigh
of
toronto
provided
for
a
series
of
recitals
having
that
scope
with
the
object
of
enabling
her
to
go
to
england
to
arrange
for
the
publication
of
her
poems
within
two
years
this
aim
was
accomplished
her
book
of
poems
the
white
wampum
being
published
by
john
lane
of
the
bodley
head
she
took
with
her
numerous
letters
of
introduction
including
one
from
the
the
earl
of
aberdeen
and
she
soon
gained
both
social
and
literary
standing
her
book
was
received
with
much
favor
both
by
reviewers
and
the
public
after
giving
many
recitals
in
fashionable
she
returned
to
canada
and
made
her
first
tour
to
the
pacific
coast
giving
recitals
at
all
the
cities
and
towns
en
route
since
then
she
has
crossed
the
rocky
mountains
no
fewer
than
nineteen
times
miss
johnson
pen
had
not
been
idle
and
in
the
george
morang
of
toronto
published
her
second
book
of
poems
entitled
canadian
born
which
was
also
well
received
after
a
number
of
recitals
which
included
newfoundland
and
the
maritime
provinces
she
went
to
england
again
in
and
made
her
first
appearance
in
steinway
hall
under
the
distinguished
patronage
of
lord
and
lady
strathcona
in
the
following
year
she
again
visited
london
returning
by
way
of
the
united
states
where
she
gave
many
recitals
after
another
tour
of
canada
she
decided
to
give
up
public
work
to
make
vancouver
her
home
and
to
devote
herself
to
literary
work
only
a
woman
of
remarkable
powers
of
endurance
could
have
borne
up
under
the
hardships
necessarily
encountered
in
travelling
through
canada
in
pioneer
days
as
miss
johnson
did
and
shortly
after
settling
down
in
vancouver
the
exposure
and
hardship
she
had
endured
began
to
tell
on
her
and
her
health
completely
broke
down
for
almost
a
year
she
has
been
an
invalid
and
as
she
is
unable
to
attend
to
the
business
herself
a
trust
has
been
formed
by
some
of
the
leading
citizens
of
her
adopted
city
for
the
purpose
of
collecting
and
publishing
for
her
benefit
her
later
works
among
these
are
the
beautiful
indian
legends
contained
in
this
volume
which
she
has
been
at
great
pains
to
collect
and
a
series
of
stories
which
have
been
exceedingly
well
received
by
magazine
readers
during
the
sixteen
years
miss
johnson
was
travelling
she
had
many
varied
and
interesting
experiences
she
travelled
the
old
battleford
trail
before
the
railroad
went
through
and
across
the
boundary
country
in
british
columbia
in
the
romantic
days
of
the
early
pioneers
once
she
took
an
eight
hundred
and
fifty
mile
drive
up
the
cariboo
trail
to
the
gold
fields
she
has
always
been
an
ardent
canoeist
and
has
run
many
strange
rivers
crossed
many
a
lonely
lake
and
camped
in
many
an
unfrequented
place
these
venturesome
trips
she
made
more
from
her
inherent
love
of
nature
and
adventure
than
from
any
necessity

her

the
swim
into
the

their
clouds

and
grey
they
catch
the
earliest
hint
of
sunrise
they
hold
the
last
color
of
sunset
twin
mountains
they
are
lifting
their
twin
peaks
above
the
fairest
city
in
all
canada
and
known
throughout
the
british
empire
as
the
lions
of
vancouver
sometimes
the
smoke
of
forest
fires
blurs
them
until
they
gleam
like
opals
in
a
purple
atmosphere
too
beautiful
for
words
to
paint
sometimes
the
slanting
rains
festoon
scarfs
of
mist
about
their
crests
and
the
peaks
fade
into
shadowy
outlines
melting
melting
forever
melting
into
the
distances
but
for
most
days
in
the
year
the
sun
circles
the
twin
glories
with
a
sweep
of
gold
the
moon
washes
them
with
a
torrent
of
silver
oftentimes
when
the
city
is
shrouded
in
rain
the
sun
yellows
their
snows
to
a
deep
orange
but
through
sun
and
shadow
they
stand
immovable
smiling
westward
above
the
waters
of
the
restless
pacific
eastward
above
the
superb
beauty
of
the
capilano
canyon
but
the
indian
tribes
do
not
know
these
peaks
as
the
lions
even
the
chief
whose
feet
have
so
recently
wandered
to
the
happy
hunting
grounds
never
heard
the
name
given
them
until
i
mentioned
it
to
him
one
dreamy
august
day
as
together
we
followed
the
trail
leading
to
the
canyon
he
seemed
so
surprised
at
the
name
that
i
mentioned
the
reason
it
had
been
applied
to
them
asking
him
if
he
recalled
the
landseer
lions
in
trafalgar
square
yes
he
remembered
those
splendid
sculptures
and
his
quick
eye
saw
the
resemblance
instantly
it
appeared
to
please
him
and
his
fine
face
expressed
the
haunting
memories
of
the
roar
of
old
london
but
the
call
of
the
blood
was
stronger
and
presently
he
referred
to
the
indian
legend
of
those
peaks
a
legend
that
i
have
reason
to
believe
is
absolutely
unknown
to
thousands
of
palefaces
who
look
upon
the
lions
daily
without
the
love
for
them
that
is
in
the
indian
heart
without
knowledge
of
the
secret
of
the
two
sisters
the
legend
was
intensely
fascinating
as
it
left
his
lips
in
the
quaint
broken
english
that
is
never
so
dulcet
as
when
it
slips
from
an
indian
tongue
his
inimitable
gestures
strong
graceful
comprehensive
were
like
a
perfectly
chosen
frame
embracing
a
delicate
painting
and
his
brooding
eyes
were
as
the
light
in
which
the
picture
hung
many
thousands
of
years
ago
he
began
there
were
no
twin
peaks
like
sentinels
guarding
the
outposts
of
this
sunset
coast
they
were
placed
there
long
after
the
first
creation
when
the
sagalie
tyee
moulded
the
mountains
and
patterned
the
mighty
rivers
where
the
salmon
run
because
of
his
love
for
his
indian
children
and
his
wisdom
for
their
necessities
in
those
times
there
were
many
and
mighty
indian
tribes
along
the
pacific
in
the
mountain
ranges
at
the
shores
and
sources
of
the
great
fraser
river
indian
law
ruled
the
land
indian
customs
prevailed
indian
beliefs
were
regarded
those
were
the
ages
when
great
things
occurred
to
make
the
traditions
we
repeat
to
our
children
perhaps
the
greatest
of
these
traditions
is
the
story
of
two
sisters
for
they
are
known
to
us
as
chief
daughters
and
to
them
we
owe
the
great
peace
in
which
we
live
and
have
lived
for
many
countless
moons
there
is
an
ancient
custom
amongst
the
coast
tribes
that
when
our
daughters
step
from
childhood
into
the
great
world
of
womanhood
the
occasion
must
be
made
one
of
extreme
rejoicing
the
being
who
possesses
the
possibility
of
some
day
mothering
a
a
warrior
a
brave
receives
much
consideration
in
most
nations
but
to
us
the
sunset
tribes
she
is
honored
above
all
people
the
parents
usually
give
a
great
potlatch
and
a
feast
that
lasts
many
days
the
entire
tribe
and
the
surrounding
tribes
are
bidden
to
this
festival
more
than
that
sometimes
when
a
great
tyee
celebrates
for
his
daughter
the
tribes
from
far
up
the
coast
from
the
distant
north
from
inland
from
the
island
from
the
cariboo
country
are
gathered
as
guests
to
the
feast
during
these
days
of
rejoicing
the
girl
is
placed
in
a
high
seat
an
exalted
position
for
is
she
not
marriageable
and
does
not
marriage
mean
motherhood
and
does
not
motherhood
mean
a
vaster
nation
of
brave
sons
and
of
gentle
daughters
who
in
their
turn
will
give
us
sons
and
daughters
of
their
own
but
it
was
many
thousands
of
years
ago
that
a
great
tyee
had
two
daughters
that
grew
to
womanhood
at
the
same
springtime
when
the
first
great
run
of
salmon
thronged
the
rivers
and
the
ollallie
bushes
were
heavy
with
blossoms
these
two
daughters
were
young
lovable
and
oh
very
beautiful
their
father
the
great
tyee
prepared
to
make
a
feast
such
as
the
coast
had
never
seen
there
were
to
be
days
and
days
of
rejoicing
the
people
were
to
come
for
many
leagues
were
to
bring
gifts
to
the
girls
and
to
receive
gifts
of
great
value
from
the
chief
and
hospitality
was
to
reign
as
long
as
pleasuring
feet
could
dance
and
enjoying
lips
could
laugh
and
mouths
partake
of
the
excellence
of
the
chief
fish
game
and
ollallies
the
only
shadow
on
the
joy
of
it
all
was
war
for
the
tribe
of
the
great
tyee
was
at
war
with
the
upper
coast
indians
those
who
lived
north
near
what
is
named
by
the
paleface
as
the
port
of
prince
rupert
giant
slipped
along
the
entire
coast
war
parties
paddled
up
and
down
broke
the
silences
of
the
nights
hatred
vengeance
strife
horror
festered
everywhere
like
sores
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
but
the
great
tyee
after
warring
for
weeks
turned
and
laughed
at
the
battle
and
the
bloodshed
for
he
had
been
victor
in
every
encounter
and
he
could
well
afford
to
leave
the
strife
for
a
brief
week
and
feast
in
his
daughters
honor
nor
permit
any
mere
enemy
to
come
between
him
and
the
traditions
of
his
race
and
household
so
he
turned
insultingly
deaf
ears
to
their
he
ignored
with
arrogant
indifference
their
that
encroached
within
his
own
coast
waters
and
he
prepared
as
a
great
tyee
should
to
royally
entertain
his
tribesmen
in
honor
of
his
daughters
but
seven
suns
before
the
great
feast
these
two
maidens
came
before
him
hand
clasped
in
hand
our
father
they
said
we
speak
my
daughters
my
girls
with
the
eyes
of
april
the
hearts
of
june
early
spring
and
early
summer
would
be
the
more
accurate
indian
phrasing
day
oh
our
father
we
may
mother
a
who
may
grow
to
be
just
such
a
powerful
tyee
as
you
are
and
for
this
honor
that
may
some
day
be
ours
we
have
come
to
crave
a
favor
of
you
you
oh
our
father
is
your
privilege
at
this
celebration
to
receive
any
favor
your
hearts
may
wish
he
replied
graciously
placing
his
fingers
beneath
their
girlish
chins
favor
is
yours
before
you
ask
it
my
daughters
you
for
our
sakes
invite
the
great
northern
hostile
tribe
the
tribe
you
war
upon
to
this
our
feast
they
asked
fearlessly
a
peaceful
feast
a
feast
in
the
honor
of
women
he
exclaimed
incredulously
we
would
desire
it
they
answered
so
shall
it
be
he
declared
can
deny
you
nothing
this
day
and
some
time
you
may
bear
sons
to
bless
this
peace
you
have
asked
and
to
bless
their
mother
sire
for
granting
it
then
he
turned
to
all
the
young
men
of
the
tribe
and
commanded
fires
at
sunset
on
all
the
coast
headlands
fires
of
welcome
man
your
canoes
and
face
the
north
greet
the
enemy
and
tell
them
that
i
the
tyee
of
the
capilanos
ask
no
command
that
they
join
me
for
a
great
feast
in
honor
of
my
two
daughters
and
when
the
northern
tribes
got
this
invitation
they
flocked
down
the
coast
to
this
feast
of
a
great
peace
they
brought
their
women
and
their
children
they
brought
game
and
fish
gold
and
white
stone
beads
baskets
and
carven
ladles
and
wonderful
woven
blankets
to
lay
at
the
feet
of
their
now
acknowledged
ruler
the
great
tyee
and
he
in
turn
gave
such
a
potlatch
that
nothing
but
tradition
can
vie
with
it
there
were
long
glad
days
of
joyousness
long
pleasurable
nights
of
dancing
and
and
vast
quantities
of
food
the
were
emptied
of
their
deadly
weapons
and
filled
with
the
daily
catch
of
salmon
the
hostile
ceased
and
in
their
place
were
heard
the
soft
shuffle
of
dancing
feet
the
singing
voices
of
women
the
of
the
children
of
two
powerful
tribes
which
had
been
until
now
ancient
enemies
for
a
great
and
lasting
brotherhood
was
sealed
between
them
their
were
ended
forever
then
the
sagalie
tyee
smiled
on
his
indian
children
will
make
these
maidens
immortal
he
said
in
the
cup
of
his
hands
he
lifted
the
chief
two
daughters
and
set
them
forever
in
a
high
place
for
they
had
borne
two
offspring
peace
and
brotherhood
each
of
which
is
now
a
great
tyee
ruling
this
land
and
on
the
mountain
crest
the
chief
daughters
can
be
seen
wrapped
in
the
suns
the
snows
the
stars
of
all
seasons
for
they
have
stood
in
this
high
place
for
thousands
of
years
and
will
stand
for
thousands
of
years
to
come
guarding
the
peace
of
the
pacific
coast
and
the
quiet
of
the
capilano
canyon
this
is
the
indian
legend
of
the
lions
of
vancouver
as
i
had
it
from
one
who
will
tell
me
no
more
the
traditions
of
his
people
the
siwash
rock
unique
and
so
distinct
from
its
surroundings
as
to
suggest
rather
the
handicraft
of
man
than
a
whim
of
nature
it
looms
up
at
the
entrance
to
the
narrows
a
symmetrical
column
of
solid
grey
stone
there
are
no
similar
formations
within
the
range
of
vision
or
indeed
within
many
a
day
paddle
up
and
down
the
coast
amongst
all
the
wonders
the
natural
beauties
that
encircle
vancouver
the
marvels
of
mountains
shaped
into
crouching
lions
and
brooding
beavers
the
yawning
canyons
the
stupendous
forest
firs
and
cedars
siwash
rock
stands
as
distinct
as
individual
as
if
dropped
from
another
sphere
i
saw
it
first
in
the
slanting
light
of
a
redly
setting
august
sun
the
little
tuft
of
green
shrubbery
that
crests
its
summit
was
black
against
the
crimson
of
sea
and
sky
and
its
colossal
base
of
grey
stone
gleamed
like
flaming
polished
granite
my
old
tillicum
lifted
his
to
point
towards
it
you
know
the
story
he
asked
i
shook
my
head
experience
has
taught
me
his
love
of
silent
replies
his
moods
of
for
a
time
we
paddled
slowly
the
rock
detached
itself
from
its
background
of
forest
and
shore
and
it
stood
forth
like
a
sentinel
erect
enduring
eternal
do
you
think
it
stands
straight
like
a
man
he
asked
yes
like
some
upright
warrior
i
replied
it
is
a
man
he
said
and
a
warrior
man
too
a
man
who
fought
for
everything
that
was
noble
and
upright
what
do
you
regard
as
everything
that
is
noble
and
upright
chief
i
asked
curious
as
to
his
ideas
i
shall
not
forget
the
reply
it
was
but
two
words
astounding
amazing
words
he
said
simply
clean
fatherhood
through
my
mind
raced
tumultuous
recollections
of
numberless
articles
in
yet
numberless
magazines
all
dealing
with
the
recent
fad
of
motherhood
but
i
had
to
hear
from
the
lip
of
a
squamish
indian
chief
the
only
treatise
on
the
nobility
of
clean
fatherhood
that
i
have
yet
unearthed
and
this
treatise
has
been
an
indian
legend
for
centuries
and
lest
they
forget
how
those
two
little
words
must
ever
be
siwash
rock
stands
to
remind
them
set
there
by
the
deity
as
a
monument
to
one
who
kept
his
own
life
clean
that
cleanliness
might
be
the
heritage
of
the
generations
to
come
it
was
thousands
of
years
ago
all
indian
legends
begin
in
extremely
remote
times
that
a
handsome
boy
chief
journeyed
in
his
canoe
to
the
upper
coast
for
the
shy
little
northern
girl
whom
he
brought
home
as
his
wife
boy
though
he
was
the
young
chief
had
proved
himself
to
be
an
excellent
warrior
a
fearless
hunter
and
an
upright
courageous
man
among
men
his
tribe
loved
him
his
enemies
respected
him
and
the
base
and
mean
and
cowardly
feared
him
the
customs
and
traditions
of
his
ancestors
were
a
positive
religion
to
him
the
sayings
and
the
advices
of
the
old
people
were
his
creed
he
was
conservative
in
every
rite
and
ritual
of
his
race
he
fought
his
tribal
enemies
like
the
savage
that
he
was
he
sang
his
danced
his
slew
his
foes
but
the
little
from
the
north
he
treated
with
the
deference
that
he
gave
his
own
mother
for
was
she
not
to
be
the
mother
of
his
warrior
son
the
year
rolled
round
weeks
merged
into
months
winter
into
spring
and
one
glorious
summer
at
daybreak
he
wakened
to
her
voice
calling
him
she
stood
beside
him
smiling
it
will
be
she
said
proudly
he
sprang
from
his
couch
of
and
looked
out
upon
the
coming
day
the
promise
of
what
it
would
bring
him
seemed
breathing
through
all
his
forest
world
he
took
her
very
gently
by
the
hand
and
led
her
through
the
tangle
of
wilderness
down
to
the
edge
where
the
beauty
spot
we
moderns
call
stanley
park
bends
about
prospect
point
i
must
swim
he
told
her
i
must
swim
too
she
smiled
with
the
perfect
understanding
of
two
beings
who
are
mated
for
to
them
the
old
indian
custom
was
law
the
custom
that
the
parents
of
a
coming
child
must
swim
until
their
flesh
is
so
clear
and
clean
that
a
wild
animal
can
not
scent
their
proximity
if
the
wild
creatures
of
the
forests
have
no
fear
of
them
then
and
only
then
are
they
fit
to
become
parents
and
to
scent
a
human
is
in
itself
a
fearsome
thing
to
all
wild
creatures
so
those
two
plunged
into
the
waters
of
the
narrows
as
the
grey
dawn
slipped
up
the
eastern
skies
and
all
the
forest
awoke
to
the
life
of
a
new
glad
day
presently
he
took
her
ashore
and
smilingly
she
crept
away
under
the
giant
trees
i
must
be
alone
she
said
but
come
to
me
at
sunrise
you
will
not
find
me
alone
then
he
smiled
also
and
plunged
back
into
the
sea
he
must
swim
swim
swim
through
this
hour
when
his
fatherhood
was
coming
upon
him
it
was
the
law
that
he
must
be
clean
spotlessly
clean
so
that
when
his
child
looked
out
upon
the
world
it
would
have
the
chance
to
live
its
own
life
clean
if
he
did
not
swim
hour
upon
hour
his
child
would
come
to
an
unclean
father
he
must
give
his
child
a
chance
in
life
he
must
not
hamper
it
by
his
own
uncleanliness
at
its
birth
it
was
the
tribal
law
the
law
of
vicarious
purity
as
he
swam
joyously
to
and
fro
a
canoe
bearing
four
men
headed
up
the
narrows
these
men
were
giants
in
stature
and
the
stroke
of
their
paddles
made
huge
eddies
that
boiled
like
the
seething
tides
out
from
our
course
they
cried
as
his
lithe
body
arose
and
fell
with
his
splendid
stroke
he
laughed
at
them
giants
though
they
were
and
answered
that
he
could
not
cease
his
swimming
at
their
demand
but
you
shall
cease
they
commanded
we
are
the
men
agents
of
the
sagalie
tyee
god
and
we
command
you
ashore
out
of
our
way
i
find
in
all
these
coast
indian
legends
that
the
deity
is
represented
by
four
men
usually
paddling
an
immense
canoe
he
ceased
swimming
and
lifting
his
head
defied
them
i
shall
not
stop
nor
yet
go
ashore
he
declared
striking
out
once
more
to
the
middle
of
the
channel
do
you
dare
disobey
us
they
cried
we
the
men
of
the
sagalie
tyee
we
can
turn
you
into
a
fish
or
a
tree
or
a
stone
for
this
do
you
dare
disobey
the
great
tyee
i
dare
anything
for
the
cleanliness
and
purity
of
my
coming
child
i
dare
even
the
sagalie
tyee
himself
but
my
child
must
be
born
to
a
spotless
life
the
four
men
were
astounded
they
consulted
together
lighted
their
pipes
and
sat
in
council
never
had
they
the
men
of
the
sagalie
tyee
been
defied
before
now
for
the
sake
of
a
little
unborn
child
they
were
ignored
disobeyed
almost
despised
the
lithe
young
body
still
disported
itself
in
the
cool
waters
superstition
held
that
should
their
canoe
or
even
their
touch
a
human
being
their
marvellous
power
would
be
lost
the
handsome
young
chief
swam
directly
in
their
course
they
dared
not
run
him
down
if
so
they
would
become
as
other
men
while
they
yet
counselled
what
to
do
there
floated
from
out
the
forest
a
faint
strange
compelling
sound
they
listened
and
the
young
chief
ceased
his
stroke
as
he
listened
also
the
faint
sound
drifted
out
across
the
waters
once
more
it
was
the
cry
of
a
little
little
child
then
one
of
the
four
men
he
that
steered
the
canoe
the
strongest
and
tallest
of
them
all
arose
and
standing
erect
stretched
out
his
arms
towards
the
rising
sun
and
chanted
not
a
curse
on
the
young
chief
disobedience
but
a
promise
of
everlasting
days
and
freedom
from
death
because
you
have
defied
all
things
that
come
in
your
path
we
promise
this
to
you
he
chanted
you
have
defied
what
interferes
with
your
child
chance
for
a
clean
life
you
have
lived
as
you
wish
your
son
to
live
you
have
defied
us
when
we
would
have
stopped
your
swimming
and
hampered
your
child
future
you
have
placed
that
child
future
before
all
things
and
for
this
the
sagalie
tyee
commands
us
to
make
you
forever
a
pattern
for
your
tribe
you
shall
never
die
but
you
shall
stand
through
all
the
thousands
of
years
to
come
where
all
eyes
can
see
you
you
shall
live
live
live
as
an
indestructible
monument
to
clean
fatherhood
the
four
men
lifted
their
paddles
and
the
handsome
young
chief
swam
inshore
as
his
feet
touched
the
line
where
sea
and
land
met
he
was
transformed
into
stone
then
the
four
men
said
his
wife
and
child
must
ever
be
near
him
they
shall
not
die
but
live
also
and
they
too
were
turned
into
stone
if
you
penetrate
the
hollows
in
the
woods
near
siwash
rock
you
will
find
a
large
rock
and
a
smaller
one
beside
it
they
are
the
shy
little
from
the
north
with
her
baby
beside
her
and
from
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
world
vessels
come
daily
throbbing
and
sailing
up
the
narrows
from
far
ports
from
the
frozen
north
from
the
lands
of
the
southern
cross
they
pass
and
repass
the
living
rock
that
was
there
before
their
hulls
were
shaped
that
will
be
there
when
their
very
names
are
forgotten
when
their
crews
and
their
captains
have
taken
their
long
last
voyage
when
their
merchandise
has
rotted
and
their
owners
are
known
no
more
but
the
tall
grey
column
of
stone
will
still
be
there
a
monument
to
one
man
fidelity
to
a
generation
yet
unborn
and
will
endure
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
the
recluse
journeying
toward
the
upper
course
of
the
capilano
river
about
a
mile
citywards
from
the
dam
you
will
pass
a
disused
shack
leave
the
trail
at
this
point
and
strike
through
the
undergrowth
for
a
few
hundred
yards
to
the
left
and
you
will
be
on
the
rocky
borders
of
that
purest
most
restless
river
in
all
canada
the
stream
is
haunted
with
tradition
teeming
with
a
score
of
romances
that
vie
with
its
grandeur
and
loveliness
and
of
which
its
waters
are
perpetually
whispering
but
i
learned
this
legend
from
one
whose
voice
was
as
dulcet
as
the
swirling
rapids
but
unlike
them
that
voice
is
hushed
while
the
river
the
river
still
sings
on
sings
on
it
was
singing
in
very
melodious
tones
through
the
long
august
afternoon
two
summers
ago
while
we
the
chief
his
wife
and
bright
young
daughter
all
lounged
amongst
the
boulders
and
watched
the
lazy
clouds
drift
from
peak
to
peak
far
above
us
it
was
one
of
his
inspired
days
legends
crowded
to
his
lips
as
a
whistle
teases
the
mouth
of
a
happy
boy
his
heart
was
brimming
with
tales
of
the
bygones
his
eyes
were
dark
with
dreams
and
that
strange
mournfulness
that
always
haunted
them
when
he
spoke
of
romances
there
was
not
a
tree
a
boulder
a
dash
of
rapid
upon
which
his
glance
fell
which
he
could
not
link
with
some
ancient
poetic
superstition
then
abruptly
in
the
very
midst
of
his
verbal
reveries
he
turned
and
asked
me
if
i
were
superstitious
of
course
i
replied
that
i
was
do
you
think
some
happenings
will
bring
trouble
later
on
will
foretell
evil
he
asked
i
made
some
evasive
answer
which
however
seemed
to
satisfy
him
for
he
plunged
into
the
strange
tale
of
the
recluse
of
the
canyon
with
more
vigor
than
dreaminess
but
first
he
asked
me
the
question
what
do
your
own
tribes
those
east
of
the
great
mountains
think
of
twin
children
i
shook
my
head
that
is
enough
he
said
before
i
could
reply
i
see
your
people
do
not
like
them
twin
children
are
almost
unknown
with
us
i
hastened
they
are
rare
very
rare
but
it
is
true
we
do
not
welcome
them
why
he
asked
abruptly
i
was
a
little
uncertain
about
telling
him
if
i
said
the
wrong
thing
the
coming
tale
might
die
on
his
lips
before
it
was
born
to
speech
but
we
understood
each
other
so
well
that
i
finally
ventured
the
truth
we
iroquois
say
that
twin
children
are
as
rabbits
i
explained
the
nation
always
nicknames
the
parents
that
is
the
mohawk
for
rabbit
is
that
all
he
asked
curiously
that
is
all
is
it
not
enough
to
render
twin
children
unwelcome
i
questioned
he
thought
a
while
then
with
evident
desire
to
learn
how
all
races
regarded
this
occurrence
he
said
you
have
been
much
among
the
palefaces
what
do
they
say
of
twins
oh
the
palefaces
like
them
they
are
they
are
oh
well
they
say
they
are
very
proud
of
having
twins
i
stammered
once
again
i
was
hardly
sure
of
my
ground
he
looked
most
incredulous
and
i
was
led
to
enquire
what
his
own
people
of
the
squamish
thought
of
this
discussed
problem
it
is
no
pride
to
us
he
said
decidedly
nor
yet
is
it
disgrace
of
rabbits
but
it
is
a
fearsome
thing
a
sign
of
coming
evil
to
the
father
and
worse
than
that
of
coming
disaster
to
the
tribe
then
i
knew
he
held
in
his
heart
some
strange
incident
that
gave
substance
to
the
superstition
wo
you
tell
it
to
me
i
begged
he
leaned
a
little
backward
against
a
giant
boulder
clasping
his
thin
brown
hands
about
his
knees
his
eyes
roved
up
the
galloping
river
then
swept
down
the
singing
waters
to
where
they
crowded
past
the
sudden
bend
and
during
the
entire
recital
of
the
strange
legend
his
eyes
never
left
that
spot
where
the
stream
disappeared
in
its
hurrying
journey
to
the
sea
without
preamble
he
began
it
was
a
grey
morning
when
they
told
him
of
this
disaster
that
had
befallen
him
he
was
a
great
chief
and
he
ruled
many
tribes
on
the
north
pacific
coast
but
what
was
his
greatness
now
his
young
wife
had
borne
him
twins
and
was
sobbing
out
her
anguish
in
the
little
lodge
near
the
tidewater
beyond
the
doorway
gathered
many
old
men
and
women
old
in
years
old
in
wisdom
old
in
the
lore
and
learning
of
their
nations
some
of
them
wept
some
chanted
solemnly
the
dirge
of
their
lost
hopes
and
happiness
which
would
never
return
because
of
this
calamity
others
discussed
in
hushed
voices
this
awesome
thing
and
for
hours
their
grave
council
was
broken
only
by
the
infant
cries
of
the
two
in
the
bark
lodge
the
hopeless
sobs
of
the
young
mother
the
agonized
moans
of
the
stricken
chief
their
father
dire
will
happen
to
the
tribe
said
the
old
men
in
council
dire
will
happen
to
him
my
husband
wept
the
young
mother
dire
will
happen
to
us
all
echoed
the
unhappy
father
then
an
ancient
arose
lifting
his
arms
outstretching
his
palms
to
hush
the
lamenting
throng
his
voice
shook
with
the
weight
of
many
winters
but
his
eyes
were
yet
keen
and
mirrored
the
clear
thought
and
brain
behind
them
as
the
still
in
the
capilano
mirror
the
mountain
tops
his
words
were
masterful
his
gestures
commanding
his
shoulders
erect
and
kindly
his
was
a
personality
and
an
inspiration
that
no
one
dared
dispute
and
his
judgment
was
accepted
as
the
words
fell
slowly
like
a
doom
is
the
olden
law
of
the
squamish
that
lest
evil
befall
the
tribe
the
sire
of
twin
children
must
go
afar
and
alone
into
the
mountain
fastnesses
there
by
his
isolation
and
his
loneliness
to
prove
himself
stronger
than
the
threatened
evil
and
thus
to
beat
back
the
shadow
that
would
otherwise
follow
him
and
all
his
people
i
therefore
name
for
him
the
length
of
days
that
he
must
spend
alone
fighting
his
invisible
enemy
he
will
know
by
some
great
sign
in
nature
the
hour
that
the
evil
is
conquered
the
hour
that
his
race
is
saved
he
must
leave
before
this
sun
sets
taking
with
him
only
his
strongest
bow
his
fleetest
arrows
and
going
up
into
the
mountain
wilderness
remain
there
ten
days
alone
alone
the
masterful
voice
ceased
the
tribe
wailed
their
assent
the
father
arose
speechless
his
drawn
face
revealing
great
agony
over
this
seemingly
brief
banishment
he
took
leave
of
his
sobbing
wife
of
the
two
tiny
souls
that
were
his
sons
grasped
his
favorite
bow
and
arrows
and
faced
the
forest
like
a
warrior
but
at
the
end
of
the
ten
days
he
did
not
return
nor
yet
ten
weeks
nor
yet
ten
months
is
dead
wept
the
mother
into
the
baby
ears
of
her
two
boys
could
not
battle
against
the
evil
that
threatened
it
was
stronger
than
he
he
so
strong
so
proud
so
brave
is
dead
echoed
the
tribesmen
and
the
tribeswomen
strong
brave
chief
he
is
dead
so
they
mourned
the
long
year
through
but
their
chants
and
their
tears
but
renewed
their
grief
he
did
not
return
to
them
meanwhile
far
up
the
capilano
the
banished
chief
had
built
his
solitary
home
for
who
can
tell
what
fatal
trick
of
sound
what
current
of
air
what
faltering
note
in
the
voice
of
the
had
deceived
his
alert
indian
ears
but
some
unhappy
fate
had
led
him
to
understand
that
his
solitude
must
be
of
ten
years
duration
not
ten
days
and
he
had
accepted
the
mandate
with
the
heroism
of
a
stoic
for
if
he
had
refused
to
do
so
his
belief
was
that
although
the
threatened
disaster
would
be
spared
him
the
evil
would
fall
upon
his
tribe
thus
was
one
more
added
to
the
long
list
of
souls
whose
creed
has
been
is
fitting
that
one
should
suffer
for
the
people
it
was
the
heroism
of
vicarious
sacrifice
with
his
the
banished
squamish
chief
stripped
the
bark
from
the
firs
and
cedars
building
for
himself
a
lodge
beside
the
capilano
river
where
leaping
trout
and
salmon
could
be
speared
by
fastened
to
deftly
shaped
long
handles
all
through
the
he
smoked
and
dried
the
fish
with
the
care
of
a
housewife
the
mountain
sheep
and
goats
and
even
huge
black
and
cinnamon
bears
fell
before
his
unerring
arrows
the
deer
never
returned
to
their
haunts
from
their
evening
drinking
at
the
edge
of
the
stream
their
wild
hearts
their
agile
bodies
were
stilled
when
he
took
aim
smoked
hams
and
saddles
hung
in
rows
from
the
of
his
bark
lodge
and
the
magnificent
pelts
of
animals
carpeted
his
floors
padded
his
couch
and
clothed
his
body
he
tanned
the
soft
making
leggings
moccasins
and
shirts
stitching
them
together
with
deer
sinew
as
he
had
seen
his
mother
do
in
the
he
gathered
the
juicy
their
acid
a
sylvan
healthful
change
from
meat
and
fish
month
by
month
and
year
by
year
he
sat
beside
his
lonely
waiting
for
his
long
term
of
solitude
to
end
one
comfort
alone
was
his
he
was
enduring
the
disaster
fighting
the
evil
that
his
tribe
might
go
unscathed
that
his
people
be
saved
from
calamity
slowly
laboriously
the
tenth
year
dawned
day
by
day
it
dragged
its
long
weeks
across
his
waiting
heart
for
nature
had
not
yet
given
the
sign
that
his
long
probation
was
over
then
one
hot
summer
day
the
came
crashing
through
the
mountains
about
him
up
from
the
arms
of
the
pacific
rolled
the
and
the
with
its
eyes
of
flashing
light
beat
its
huge
vibrating
wings
on
crag
and
canyon
a
tall
shaft
of
granite
rears
its
length
it
is
named
rock
and
wise
men
of
the
paleface
people
say
it
is
rich
in
ore
copper
silver
and
gold
at
the
base
of
this
shaft
the
squamish
chief
crouched
when
the
broke
and
bellowed
through
the
ranges
and
on
its
summit
the
perched
its
gigantic
wings
threshing
the
air
into
booming
sounds
into
splitting
terrors
like
the
crash
of
a
giant
cedar
hurtling
down
the
but
when
the
beating
of
those
black
pinions
ceased
and
the
echo
of
their
died
down
the
depths
of
the
canyon
the
squamish
chief
arose
as
a
new
man
the
shadow
on
his
soul
had
lifted
the
fears
of
evil
were
cowed
and
conquered
in
his
brain
his
blood
his
veins
his
sinews
he
felt
that
the
poison
of
melancholy
dwelt
no
more
he
had
redeemed
his
fault
of
fathering
twin
children
he
had
fulfilled
the
demands
of
the
law
of
his
tribe
as
he
heard
the
last
beat
of
the
wings
dying
slowly
faintly
faintly
among
the
crags
he
knew
that
the
bird
too
was
dying
for
its
soul
was
leaving
its
monster
black
body
and
presently
that
soul
appeared
in
the
sky
he
could
see
it
arching
overhead
before
it
took
its
long
journey
to
the
happy
hunting
grounds
for
the
soul
of
the
was
a
radiant
of
glorious
color
spanning
from
peak
to
peak
he
lifted
his
head
then
for
he
knew
it
was
the
sign
the
ancient
had
told
him
to
wait
for
the
sign
that
his
long
banishment
was
ended
and
all
these
years
down
in
the
tidewater
country
the
little
twins
were
asking
childwise
is
our
father
why
have
we
no
father
like
other
boys
to
be
met
only
with
the
reply
father
is
no
more
your
father
the
great
chief
is
dead
but
some
strange
filial
intuition
told
the
boys
that
their
sire
would
some
day
return
often
they
voiced
this
feeling
to
their
mother
but
she
would
only
weep
and
say
that
not
even
the
witchcraft
of
the
great
could
bring
him
to
them
but
when
they
were
ten
years
old
the
two
children
came
to
their
mother
hand
within
hand
they
were
armed
with
their
little
their
their
tiny
bows
and
arrows
go
to
find
our
father
they
said
useless
quest
wailed
the
mother
useless
quest
echoed
the
but
the
great
said
heart
of
a
child
has
invisible
eyes
perhaps
the
see
him
the
heart
of
a
child
has
invisible
ears
perhaps
the
hear
him
call
let
them
go
so
the
little
children
went
forth
into
the
forest
their
young
feet
flew
as
though
shod
with
wings
their
young
hearts
pointed
to
the
north
as
does
the
white
man
compass
day
after
day
they
journeyed
until
rounding
a
sudden
bend
they
beheld
a
bark
lodge
with
a
thin
blue
curl
of
smoke
drifting
from
its
roof
is
our
father
lodge
they
told
each
other
for
their
childish
hearts
were
unerring
in
response
to
the
call
of
kinship
hand
in
hand
they
approached
and
entering
the
lodge
said
the
one
word
the
great
squamish
chief
outstretched
his
arms
towards
them
then
towards
the
laughing
river
then
towards
the
mountains
my
sons
he
said
my
mountains
my
brothers
my
crags
and
my
canyons
and
with
a
child
clinging
to
each
hand
he
faced
once
more
the
country
of
the
tidewater
the
legend
was
ended
for
a
long
time
he
sat
in
silence
he
had
removed
his
gaze
from
the
bend
in
the
river
around
which
the
two
children
had
come
and
where
the
eyes
of
the
recluse
had
first
rested
on
them
after
ten
years
of
solitude
the
chief
spoke
again
it
was
here
on
this
spot
we
are
sitting
that
he
built
his
lodge
here
he
dwelt
those
ten
years
alone
alone
i
nodded
silently
the
legend
was
too
beautiful
to
mar
with
comments
and
as
the
twilight
fell
we
threaded
our
way
through
the
underbrush
past
the
disused
logger
camp
and
into
the
trail
that
leads
citywards
the
lost
great
had
been
the
run
and
the
sockeye
season
was
almost
over
for
that
reason
i
wondered
many
times
why
my
old
friend
the
klootchman
had
failed
to
make
one
of
the
fishing
fleet
she
was
an
indefatigable
rivalling
her
husband
as
an
expert
catcher
and
all
the
year
through
she
talked
of
little
else
but
the
coming
run
but
this
especial
season
she
had
not
appeared
amongst
her
the
fleet
and
the
canneries
knew
nothing
of
her
and
when
i
enquired
of
her
they
would
reply
without
explanation
she
not
here
this
year
but
one
russet
september
afternoon
i
found
her
i
had
idled
down
the
trail
from
the
swans
basin
in
stanley
park
to
the
rim
that
skirts
the
narrows
and
i
saw
her
graceful
canoe
heading
for
the
beach
that
is
the
favorite
of
the
tillicums
from
the
mission
her
canoe
looked
like
a
for
the
water
was
very
still
and
everywhere
a
blue
film
hung
like
a
fragrant
veil
for
the
peat
on
lulu
island
had
been
smoldering
for
days
and
its
pungent
odors
and
haze
made
a
of
sea
and
shore
and
sky
i
hurried
hailing
her
in
the
chinook
and
as
she
caught
my
voice
she
lifted
her
paddle
directly
above
her
head
in
the
indian
signal
of
greeting
as
she
beached
i
greeted
her
with
extended
eager
hands
to
assist
her
ashore
for
the
klootchman
is
getting
to
be
an
old
woman
albeit
she
paddles
against
tidewater
like
a
boy
in
his
teens
no
she
said
as
i
begged
her
to
come
ashore
i
will
wait
me
i
just
come
to
fetch
maarda
she
been
city
she
soon
come
now
but
she
left
her
working
attitude
and
curled
like
a
in
the
bow
of
the
canoe
her
elbows
resting
on
her
paddle
which
she
had
flung
across
the
gunwales
i
have
missed
you
klootchman
you
have
not
been
to
see
me
for
three
moons
and
you
have
not
fished
or
been
at
the
canneries
i
remarked
no
she
said
i
stay
home
this
year
then
leaning
towards
me
with
grave
import
in
her
manner
her
eyes
her
voice
she
added
i
have
a
grandchild
born
first
week
july
so
i
stay
so
this
explained
her
absence
i
of
course
offered
congratulations
and
enquired
all
about
the
great
event
for
this
was
her
first
grandchild
and
the
little
person
was
of
importance
and
are
you
going
to
make
a
fisherman
of
him
i
asked
no
no
not
it
is
she
answered
with
some
indescribable
trick
of
expression
that
led
me
to
know
she
preferred
it
so
you
are
pleased
it
is
a
girl
i
questioned
in
surprise
very
pleased
she
replied
emphatically
very
good
luck
to
have
girl
for
first
grandchild
our
tribe
not
like
yours
we
want
girl
children
first
we
not
always
wish
born
just
for
fight
your
people
they
care
only
for
our
tribe
more
peaceful
very
good
sign
first
grandchild
to
be
girl
i
tell
you
why
may
be
some
time
mother
herself
very
grand
thing
to
be
mother
i
felt
i
had
caught
the
secret
of
her
meaning
she
was
rejoicing
that
this
little
one
should
some
time
become
one
of
the
mothers
of
her
race
we
chatted
over
it
a
little
longer
and
she
gave
me
several
playful
digs
about
my
own
tribe
thinking
so
much
less
of
motherhood
than
hers
and
so
much
more
of
battle
and
bloodshed
then
we
drifted
into
talk
of
the
sockeye
and
of
the
hyiu
chickimin
the
indians
would
get
yes
hyiu
chickimin
she
repeated
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
always
and
hyiu
when
big
salmon
run
no
more
ever
come
that
bad
year
when
not
any
fish
when
was
that
i
asked
before
you
born
or
i
or
pointing
across
the
park
to
the
distant
city
of
vancouver
that
breathed
its
wealth
and
beauty
across
the
september
afternoon
before
that
place
born
before
white
man
came
here
oh
long
before
dear
old
klootchman
i
knew
by
the
dusk
in
her
eyes
that
she
was
back
in
her
land
of
legends
and
that
soon
i
would
be
the
richer
in
my
hoard
of
indian
lore
she
sat
still
leaning
on
her
paddle
her
eyes
rested
on
the
distant
outline
of
the
blurred
heights
across
the
inlet
i
shall
not
further
attempt
her
broken
english
for
this
is
but
the
shadow
of
her
story
and
without
her
unique
personality
the
legend
is
as
a
flower
that
lacks
both
color
and
fragrance
she
called
it
the
lost
the
wife
of
the
great
tyee
was
but
a
wisp
of
a
girl
but
all
the
world
was
young
in
those
days
even
the
fraser
river
was
young
and
small
not
the
mighty
water
it
is
now
but
the
pink
salmon
crowded
its
throat
just
as
they
do
now
and
the
tillicums
caught
and
salted
and
smoked
the
fish
just
as
they
have
done
this
year
just
as
they
will
always
do
but
it
was
yet
winter
and
the
rains
were
slanting
and
the
fogs
drifting
when
the
wife
of
the
great
tyee
stood
before
him
and
said
the
i
shall
give
to
you
a
great
gift
will
you
honor
me
most
if
it
is
the
gift
of
a
or
a
the
great
tyee
loved
the
woman
he
was
stern
with
his
people
hard
with
his
tribe
he
ruled
his
with
a
will
of
stone
his
said
he
had
no
human
heart
in
his
body
his
warriors
said
he
had
no
human
blood
in
his
veins
but
he
clasped
this
woman
hands
and
his
eyes
his
lips
his
voice
were
gentle
as
her
own
as
he
replied
to
me
a
a
little
that
she
may
grow
to
be
like
you
and
in
her
turn
give
to
her
husband
children
but
when
the
heard
of
his
choice
they
arose
in
great
anger
they
surrounded
him
in
a
deep
indignant
circle
are
a
slave
to
the
woman
they
declared
now
you
desire
to
make
yourself
a
slave
to
a
we
want
an
heir
a
to
be
our
great
tyee
in
years
to
come
when
you
are
old
and
weary
of
tribal
affairs
when
you
sit
wrapped
in
your
blanket
in
the
hot
summer
sunshine
because
your
blood
is
old
and
thin
what
can
a
do
to
help
either
you
or
us
who
then
will
be
our
great
tyee
he
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
menacing
circle
his
arms
folded
his
chin
raised
his
eyes
hard
as
flint
his
voice
cold
as
stone
replied
she
will
give
you
such
a
and
if
so
the
child
is
yours
he
will
belong
to
you
not
to
me
he
will
become
the
possession
of
the
people
but
if
the
child
is
a
girl
she
will
belong
to
me
she
will
be
mine
you
can
not
take
her
from
me
as
you
took
me
from
my
mother
side
and
forced
me
to
forget
my
aged
father
in
my
service
to
the
tribe
she
will
belong
to
me
will
be
the
mother
of
my
grandchildren
and
her
husband
will
be
my
son
do
not
care
for
the
good
of
your
tribe
you
care
only
for
your
own
wishes
and
desires
they
rebelled
the
is
small
we
will
have
no
food
suppose
there
is
no
we
will
have
no
great
tyee
to
show
us
how
to
get
food
from
other
tribes
and
we
shall
starve
hearts
are
black
and
bloodless
thundered
the
great
tyee
turning
upon
them
fiercely
your
eyes
are
blinded
do
you
wish
the
tribe
to
forget
how
great
is
the
importance
of
a
child
that
will
some
day
be
a
mother
herself
and
give
to
your
children
and
grandchildren
a
great
tyee

to
live

thrive
to
increase
to
become
more
powerful

no

and
daughters
your
minds
are
dead
your
brains
are
chilled
still
even
in
your
ignorance
you
are
my
people
you
and
your
wishes
must
be
considered
i
call
together
the
great
the
men
of
witchcraft
the
men
of
magic
they
shall
decide
the
laws
which
will
follow
the
bearing
of
either
boy
or
what
say
you
oh
mighty
men
messengers
were
then
sent
up
and
down
the

far
up
the
fraser

and
to
the

inland
for
many
leagues
gathering
as
they
journeyed
all
the
men
of
magic
that
could
be
found
never
were
so
many
in
council
before
they
built
fires
and
danced
and
chanted
for
many
days
they
spoke
with
the
gods
of
the
mountains
with
the
gods
of
the
sea
then
power
of
decision
came
to
them
they
were
inspired
with
a
choice
to
lay
before
the

the
most
ancient

all
the
coast
region
arose
and
spoke
their
resolution
people
of
the

can
not
be
allowed
to
have
all
things
they
want
a
and
they
want
a
great

they
can
not
have
both
the
sagalie
tyee
has
revealed
to
us
the
great
men
of
magic
that
both
these
things
will
make
the
people
arrogant
and
selfish
they
must
choose
between
the
two
oh
you

commanded
the

you
not
know
how
great
a
is
that
spring
people
from
a
score
of
tribes
came
up
to
the

came
great
distances
from
the
mountains
the
lakes
the
dry
lands
but
not
one
fish
entered
the
vast
rivers
of
the
pacific
coast
the
people
had
made
their
choice
they
had
forgotten
the
honor
that
a
would
have
brought
them
they
were
bereft
of
their
food
they
were
stricken
with
poverty
through
the
long
winter
that
followed
they
endured
hunger
and
starvation
since
then
our
tribe
has
always
welcomed

want
no
more

the
klootchman
lifted
her
arms
from
her
paddle
as
she
concluded
her
eyes
left
the
irregular
outline
of
the
violet
mountains
she
had
come
back
to
this
year
of
grace
her
legend
land
had
vanished
so
she
added
you
see
now
maybe
why
i
am
glad
my
grandchild
is
girl
it
means
big
next
year
it
is
a
beautiful
story
klootchman
i
said
and
i
feel
a
cruel
delight
that
your
men
of
magic
punished
the
people
for
their
ill
choice
that
because
you
yourself
she
laughed
there
was
the
slightest
whisper
of
a
step
behind
me
i
turned
to
find
maarda
almost
at
my
elbow
the
rising
tide
was
unbeaching
the
canoe
and
as
maarda
stepped
in
and
the
klootchman
slipped
astern
it
drifted
afloat
nodded
the
klootchman
as
she
dipped
her
in
exquisite
silence
smiled
maarda
tillicums
i
replied
and
watched
for
many
moments
as
they
slipped
away
into
the
blurred
distance
until
the
canoe
merged
into
the
violet
and
grey
of
the
farther
shore
the
deep
waters
far
over
your
left
shoulder
as
your
boat
leaves
the
narrows
to
thread
the
beautiful
waterways
that
lead
to
vancouver
island
you
will
see
the
summit
of
mount
baker
robed
in
its
everlasting
whiteness
and
always
reflecting
some
wonderful
glory
from
the
rising
sun
the
golden
noontide
or
the
violet
and
amber
sunset
this
is
the
mount
ararat
of
the
pacific
coast
peoples
for
those
readers
who
are
familiar
with
the
ways
and
beliefs
and
faiths
of
primitive
races
will
agree
that
it
is
difficult
to
discover
anywhere
in
the
world
a
race
that
has
not
some
story
of
the
deluge
which
they
have
chronicled
and
localized
to
fit
the
understanding
and
the
conditions
of
the
nation
that
composes
their
own
immediate
world
amongst
the
red
nations
of
america
i
doubt
if
any
two
tribes
have
the
same
ideas
regarding
the
flood
some
of
the
traditions
concerning
this
vast
whim
of
nature
are
grotesque
in
the
extreme
some
are
impressive
some
even
profound
but
of
all
the
stories
of
the
deluge
that
i
have
been
able
to
collect
i
know
of
not
a
single
one
that
can
even
begin
to
equal
in
beauty
of
conception
let
alone
rival
in
possible
reality
and
truth
the
squamish
legend
of
the
deep
waters
i
here
quote
the
legend
of
mine
own
people
the
iroquois
tribes
of
ontario
regarding
the
deluge
i
do
this
to
paint
the
color
of
contrast
in
richer
shades
for
i
am
bound
to
admit
that
we
who
pride
ourselves
on
ancient
intellectuality
have
but
a
childish
tale
of
the
flood
when
compared
with
the
jealously
preserved
annals
of
the
squamish
which
savour
more
of
history
than
tradition
with
mine
own
people
animals
always
play
a
much
more
important
part
and
are
endowed
with
a
finer
intelligence
than
humans
i
do
not
find
amid
my
notes
a
single
tradition
of
the
iroquois
wherein
animals
do
not
figure
and
our
story
of
the
deluge
rests
entirely
with
the
intelligence
of
and
creatures
with
us
animals
in
olden
times
were
greater
than
man
but
it
is
not
so
with
the
coast
indians
except
in
rare
instances
when
a
coast
indian
consents
to
tell
you
a
legend
he
will
without
variation
begin
it
with
it
was
before
the
white
people
came
the
natural
thing
for
you
then
to
ask
is
but
who
were
here
then
he
will
reply
indians
and
just
the
trees
and
animals
and
fishes
and
a
few
birds
so
you
are
prepared
to
accept
the
animal
world
as
intelligent
of
the
pacific
slope
but
he
will
not
lead
you
to
think
he
regards
them
as
equals
much
less
superiors
but
to
revert
to
mine
own
people
they
hold
the
intelligence
of
wild
animals
far
above
that
of
man
for
perhaps
the
one
reason
that
when
an
animal
is
sick
it
effects
its
own
cure
it
knows
what
grasses
and
herbs
to
eat
what
to
avoid
while
the
sick
human
calls
the
whose
wisdom
is
not
only
the
result
of
years
of
study
but
also
heredity
consequently
any
great
natural
event
such
as
the
deluge
has
much
to
do
with
the
wisdom
of
the
creatures
of
the
forests
and
the
rivers
iroquois
tradition
tells
us
that
once
this
earth
was
entirely
submerged
in
water
and
during
this
period
for
many
days
a
busy
little
muskrat
swam
about
vainly
looking
for
a
foothold
of
earth
wherein
to
build
his
house
in
his
search
he
encountered
a
turtle
also
leisurely
swimming
so
they
had
speech
together
and
the
muskrat
complained
of
weariness
he
could
find
no
foothold
he
was
tired
of
incessant
swimming
and
longed
for
land
such
as
his
ancestors
enjoyed
the
turtle
suggested
that
the
muskrat
should
dive
and
endeavor
to
find
earth
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
acting
on
this
advice
the
muskrat
plunged
down
then
arose
with
his
two
little
forepaws
grasping
some
earth
he
had
found
beneath
the
waters
place
it
on
my
shell
and
dive
again
for
more
directed
the
turtle
the
muskrat
did
so
but
when
he
returned
with
his
paws
filled
with
earth
he
discovered
the
small
quantity
he
had
first
deposited
on
the
turtle
shell
had
doubled
in
size
the
return
from
the
third
trip
found
the
turtle
load
again
doubled
so
the
building
went
on
at
double
compound
increase
and
the
world
grew
its
continents
and
its
islands
with
great
rapidity
and
now
rests
on
the
shell
of
a
turtle
if
you
ask
an
iroquois
and
did
no
men
survive
this
flood
he
will
reply
why
should
men
survive
the
animals
are
wiser
than
men
let
the
wisest
live
how
then
was
the
earth
repeopled
the
iroquois
will
tell
you
that
the
otter
was
a
that
in
swimming
and
diving
about
he
found
corpses
of
men
and
women
he
sang
his
and
they
came
to
life
and
the
otter
brought
them
fish
for
food
until
they
were
strong
enough
to
provide
for
themselves
then
the
iroquois
will
conclude
his
tale
with
you
know
well
that
the
otter
has
greater
wisdom
than
a
man
so
much
for
mine
own
people
and
our
profound
respect
for
the
superior
intelligence
of
our
little
brothers
of
the
animal
world
but
the
squamish
tribe
hold
other
ideas
it
was
on
a
february
day
that
i
first
listened
to
this
beautiful
humane
story
of
the
deluge
my
royal
old
tillicum
had
come
to
see
me
through
the
rains
and
mists
of
late
winter
days
the
gateways
of
my
wigwam
always
stood
open
very
widely
open
for
his
feet
to
enter
and
this
especial
day
he
came
with
the
worst
downpour
of
the
season
i
protested
with
a
thousand
contradictions
in
my
voice
that
he
should
venture
out
to
see
me
on
such
a
day
it
was
oh
chief
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
and
it
was
oh
chief
why
you
stay
at
home
on
such
a
wet
day
your
poor
throat
will
suffer
but
i
soon
had
quantities
of
hot
tea
for
him
and
the
huge
cup
my
own
father
always
used
was
his
as
long
as
the
sagalie
tyee
allowed
his
dear
feet
to
wander
my
way
the
immense
cup
stands
idle
and
empty
now
for
the
second
time
helping
him
off
with
his
i
chatted
on
about
the
deluge
of
rain
and
he
remarked
it
was
not
so
very
bad
as
one
could
yet
walk
fortunately
yes
for
i
can
not
swim
i
told
him
he
laughed
replying
well
it
is
not
so
bad
as
when
the
great
deep
waters
covered
the
world
immediately
i
foresaw
the
coming
legend
so
crept
into
the
shell
of
monosyllables
no
i
questioned
no
he
replied
for
one
time
there
was
no
land
here
at
all
everywhere
there
was
just
water
i
can
quite
believe
it
i
remarked
caustically
he
laughed
that
irresistible
though
silent
david
warfield
laugh
of
his
that
always
brought
a
responsive
smile
from
his
listeners
then
he
plunged
directly
into
the
tradition
with
no
preface
save
a
comprehensive
sweep
of
his
wonderful
hands
towards
my
wide
window
against
which
the
rains
were
beating
it
was
after
a
long
long
time
of
this
this
rain
the
mountain
streams
were
swollen
the
rivers
choked
the
sea
began
to
rise
and
yet
it
rained
for
weeks
and
weeks
it
rained
he
ceased
speaking
while
the
shadows
of
centuries
gone
crept
into
his
eyes
tales
of
the
misty
past
always
inspired
him
yes
he
continued
it
rained
for
weeks
and
weeks
while
the
mountain
torrents
roared
thunderingly
down
and
the
sea
crept
silently
up
the
level
lands
were
first
to
float
in
then
to
disappear
the
slopes
were
next
to
slip
into
the
sea
the
world
was
slowly
being
flooded
hurriedly
the
indian
tribes
gathered
in
one
spot
a
place
of
safety
far
above
the
reach
of
the
sea
the
spot
was
the
circling
shore
of
lake
beautiful
up
the
north
arm
they
held
a
great
council
and
decided
at
once
upon
a
plan
of
action
a
giant
canoe
should
be
built
and
some
means
contrived
to
anchor
it
in
case
the
waters
mounted
to
the
heights
the
men
undertook
the
canoe
the
women
the
anchorage
a
giant
tree
was
felled
and
day
and
night
the
men
toiled
over
its
construction
into
the
most
stupendous
canoe
the
world
has
ever
known
not
an
hour
not
a
moment
but
many
worked
while
the
ones
slept
only
to
awake
to
renewed
toil
meanwhile
the
women
also
worked
at
a
cable
the
largest
the
longest
the
strongest
that
indian
hands
and
teeth
had
ever
made
scores
of
them
gathered
and
prepared
the
scores
of
them
plaited
rolled
and
seasoned
it
scores
of
them
chewed
upon
it
inch
by
inch
to
make
it
pliable
scores
of
them
oiled
and
worked
oiled
and
worked
oiled
and
worked
it
into
a
fabric
and
still
the
sea
crept
up
and
up
and
up
it
was
the
last
day
hope
of
life
for
the
tribes
of
land
for
the
world
was
doomed
strong
hands
hands
fastened
the
cable
the
women
had
made
one
end
to
the
giant
canoe
the
other
about
an
enormous
boulder
a
vast
immovable
rock
as
firm
as
the
foundations
of
the
world
for
might
not
the
canoe
with
its
priceless
freight
drift
out
far
out
to
sea
and
when
the
water
subsided
might
not
this
ship
of
safety
be
leagues
and
leagues
beyond
the
sight
of
land
on
the
pacific
then
with
the
bravest
hearts
that
ever
beat
noble
hands
lifted
every
child
of
the
tribe
into
this
vast
canoe
not
one
single
baby
was
overlooked
the
canoe
was
stocked
with
food
and
fresh
water
and
lastly
the
ancient
men
and
women
of
the
race
selected
as
guardians
to
these
children
the
bravest
most
stalwart
handsomest
young
man
of
the
tribes
and
the
mother
of
the
youngest
baby
in
the
camp
she
was
but
a
girl
of
sixteen
her
child
but
two
weeks
old
but
she
too
was
brave
and
very
beautiful
these
two
were
placed
she
at
the
bow
of
the
canoe
to
watch
he
at
the
stern
to
guide
and
all
the
little
children
crowded
between
and
still
the
sea
crept
up
and
up
and
up
at
the
crest
of
the
bluffs
about
lake
beautiful
the
doomed
tribes
crowded
not
a
single
person
attempted
to
enter
the
canoe
there
was
no
wailing
no
crying
out
for
safety
the
little
children
the
young
mother
and
the
bravest
and
best
of
our
young
men
live
was
all
the
farewell
those
in
the
canoe
heard
as
the
waters
reached
the
summit
and
the
canoe
floated
last
of
all
to
be
seen
was
the
top
of
the
tallest
tree
then
all
was
a
world
of
water
for
days
and
days
there
was
no
land
just
the
rush
of
swirling
snarling
sea
but
the
canoe
rode
safely
at
anchor
the
cable
those
scores
of
dead
faithful
women
had
made
held
true
as
the
hearts
that
beat
behind
the
toil
and
labor
of
it
all
but
one
morning
at
sunrise
far
to
the
south
a
speck
floated
on
the
breast
of
the
waters
at
midday
it
was
larger
at
evening
it
was
yet
larger
the
moon
arose
and
in
its
magic
light
the
man
at
the
stern
saw
it
was
a
patch
of
land
all
night
he
watched
it
grow
and
at
daybreak
looked
with
glad
eyes
upon
the
summit
of
mount
baker
he
cut
the
cable
grasped
his
paddle
in
his
strong
young
hands
and
steered
for
the
south
when
they
landed
the
waters
were
sunken
half
down
the
the
children
were
lifted
out
the
beautiful
young
mother
the
stalwart
young
brave
turned
to
each
other
clasped
hands
looked
into
each
other
eyes
and
smiled
and
down
in
the
vast
country
that
lies
between
mount
baker
and
the
fraser
river
they
made
a
new
camp
built
new
lodges
where
the
little
children
grew
and
thrived
and
lived
and
loved
and
the
earth
was
repeopled
by
them
the
squamish
say
that
in
a
gigantic
crevice
to
the
crest
of
mount
baker
may
yet
be
seen
the
outlines
of
an
enormous
canoe
but
i
have
never
seen
it
myself
he
ceased
speaking
with
that
cadence
in
his
voice
with
which
he
always
ended
a
legend
and
for
a
long
time
we
both
sat
in
silence
listening
to
the
rains
that
were
still
beating
against
the
window
the
there
is
one
vice
that
is
absolutely
unknown
to
the
red
man
he
was
born
without
it
and
amongst
all
the
deplorable
things
he
has
learned
from
the
white
races
this
at
least
he
has
never
acquired
that
is
the
vice
of
avarice
that
the
indian
looks
upon
greed
of
gain
miserliness
avariciousness
and
wealth
accumulated
above
the
head
of
his
poorer
neighbor
as
one
of
the
lowest
degradations
he
can
fall
to
is
perhaps
more
aptly
illustrated
than
anything
i
could
quote
to
demonstrate
his
horror
of
what
he
calls
the
white
man
unkindness
in
a
very
wide
and
varied
experience
with
many
tribes
i
have
yet
to
find
even
one
instance
of
avarice
and
i
have
encountered
but
one
single
case
of
a
stingy
indian
and
this
man
was
so
marked
amongst
his
fellows
that
at
mention
of
his
name
his
jeered
and
would
remark
contemptuously
that
he
was
like
a
white
man
hated
to
share
his
money
and
his
possessions
all
red
races
are
born
socialists
and
most
tribes
carry
out
their
communistic
ideas
to
the
letter
amongst
the
iroquois
it
is
considered
disgraceful
to
have
food
if
your
neighbor
has
none
to
be
a
creditable
member
of
the
nation
you
must
divide
your
possessions
with
your
less
fortunate
fellows
i
find
it
much
the
same
amongst
the
coast
indians
though
they
are
less
bitter
in
their
hatred
of
the
extremes
of
wealth
and
poverty
than
are
the
eastern
tribes
still
the
very
fact
that
they
have
preserved
this
legend
in
which
they
liken
avarice
to
a
slimy
shows
the
trend
of
their
ideas
shows
too
that
an
indian
is
an
indian
no
matter
what
his
tribe
shows
that
he
can
not
or
will
not
hoard
money
shows
that
his
native
morals
demand
that
the
spirit
of
greed
must
be
strangled
at
all
cost
the
chief
and
i
had
sat
long
over
our
luncheon
he
had
been
talking
of
his
trip
to
england
and
of
the
many
curious
things
he
had
seen
at
last
in
an
outburst
of
enthusiasm
he
said
i
saw
everything
in
the
world
everything
but
a
but
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
i
laughed
so
you
must
have
really
seen
everything
in
the
world
his
face
clouded
for
a
moment
he
sat
in
silence
then
looking
directly
at
me
said
maybe
none
now
but
long
ago
there
was
one
here
in
the
inlet
how
long
ago
i
asked
when
first
the
white
came
he
replied
came
with
greedy
clutching
fingers
greedy
eyes
greedy
hearts
the
white
men
fought
murdered
starved
went
mad
with
love
of
that
gold
far
up
the
fraser
river
tillicums
were
tillicums
no
more
brothers
were
foes
fathers
and
sons
were
enemies
their
love
of
the
gold
was
a
curse
was
it
then
the
was
seen
i
asked
perplexed
with
the
problem
of
trying
to
connect
the
with
such
a
monster
yes
it
was
then
but
he
hesitated
then
plunged
into
the
assertion
but
you
will
not
believe
the
story
if
you
think
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
i
shall
believe
whatever
you
tell
me
chief
i
answered
i
am
only
too
ready
to
believe
you
know
i
come
of
a
superstitious
race
and
all
my
association
with
the
palefaces
has
never
yet
robbed
me
of
my
birthright
to
believe
strange
traditions
you
always
understand
he
said
after
a
pause
it
my
heart
that
understands
i
remarked
quietly
he
glanced
up
quickly
and
with
one
of
his
all
too
few
radiant
smiles
he
laughed
yes
skookum
then
without
further
hesitation
he
told
the
tradition
which
although
not
of
ancient
happening
is
held
in
great
reverence
by
his
tribe
during
its
recital
he
sat
with
folded
arms
leaning
on
the
table
his
head
and
shoulders
bending
eagerly
towards
me
as
i
sat
at
the
opposite
side
it
was
the
only
time
he
ever
talked
to
me
when
he
did
not
use
emphasising
gesticulations
but
his
hands
never
once
lifted
his
wonderful
eyes
alone
gave
expression
to
what
he
called
the
legend
of
the
oluk
yes
it
was
during
the
first
gold
craze
and
many
of
our
young
men
went
as
guides
to
the
whites
far
up
the
fraser
when
they
returned
they
brought
these
tales
of
greed
and
murder
back
with
them
and
our
old
people
and
our
women
shook
their
heads
and
said
evil
would
come
of
it
but
all
our
young
men
except
one
returned
as
they
went
kind
to
the
poor
kind
to
those
who
were
foodless
sharing
whatever
they
had
with
their
tillicums
but
one
by
name
the
hawk
came
back
with
hoards
of
gold
nuggets
chickimin
money
everything
he
was
rich
like
the
white
men
and
like
them
he
kept
it
he
would
count
his
chickimin
count
his
nuggets
gloat
over
them
toss
them
in
his
palms
he
rested
his
head
on
them
as
he
slept
he
packed
them
about
with
him
through
the
day
he
loved
them
better
than
food
better
than
his
tillicums
better
than
his
life
the
entire
tribe
arose
they
said
had
the
disease
of
greed
that
to
cure
it
he
must
give
a
great
potlatch
divide
his
riches
with
the
poorer
ones
share
them
with
the
old
the
sick
the
foodless
but
he
jeered
and
laughed
and
told
them
no
and
went
on
loving
and
gloating
over
his
gold
then
the
sagalie
tyee
spoke
out
of
the
sky
and
said
you
have
made
of
yourself
a
loathsome
thing
you
will
not
listen
to
the
cry
of
the
hungry
to
the
call
of
the
old
and
sick
you
will
not
share
your
possessions
you
have
made
of
yourself
an
outcast
from
your
tribe
and
disobeyed
the
ancient
laws
of
your
people
now
i
will
make
of
you
a
thing
loathed
and
hated
by
all
men
both
white
and
red
you
will
have
two
heads
for
your
greed
has
two
mouths
to
bite
one
bites
the
poor
and
one
bites
your
own
evil
heart
and
the
fangs
in
these
mouths
are
poison
poison
that
kills
the
hungry
and
poison
that
kills
your
own
manhood
your
evil
heart
will
beat
in
the
very
centre
of
your
foul
body
and
he
that
pierces
it
will
kill
the
disease
of
greed
forever
from
amongst
his
people
and
when
the
sun
arose
above
the
north
arm
the
next
morning
the
saw
a
gigantic
stretched
across
the
surface
of
the
waters
one
hideous
head
rested
on
the
bluffs
at
brockton
point
the
other
rested
on
a
group
of
rocks
just
below
mission
at
the
western
edge
of
north
vancouver
if
you
care
to
go
there
some
day
i
will
show
you
the
hollow
in
one
great
stone
where
that
head
lay
the
were
stunned
with
horror
they
loathed
the
creature
they
hated
it
they
feared
it
day
after
day
it
lay
there
its
monstrous
heads
lifted
out
of
the
waters
its
body
blocking
all
entrance
from
the
narrows
all
outlet
from
the
north
arm
the
chiefs
made
council
the
danced
and
chanted
but
the
oluk
never
moved
it
could
not
move
for
it
was
the
hated
totem
of
what
now
rules
the
white
man
world
greed
and
love
of
chickimin
no
one
can
ever
move
the
love
of
chickimin
from
the
white
man
heart
no
one
can
ever
make
him
divide
all
with
the
poor
but
after
the
chiefs
and
had
done
all
in
their
power
and
still
the
oluk
lay
across
the
waters
a
handsome
boy
of
sixteen
approached
them
and
reminded
them
of
the
words
of
the
sagalie
tyee
he
that
pierced
the
monster
heart
would
kill
the
disease
of
greed
forever
amongst
his
people
me
try
to
find
this
evil
heart
oh
great
men
of
my
tribe
he
cried
me
war
upon
this
creature
let
me
try
to
rid
my
people
of
this
pestilence
the
boy
was
brave
and
very
beautiful
his
called
him
the
tenas
tyee
little
chief
and
they
loved
him
of
all
his
wealth
of
fish
and
furs
of
game
and
hykwa
large
he
gave
to
the
boys
who
had
none
he
hunted
food
for
the
old
people
he
tanned
skins
and
furs
for
those
whose
feet
were
feeble
whose
eyes
were
fading
whose
blood
ran
thin
with
age
him
go
cried
the
unclean
monster
can
only
be
overcome
by
cleanliness
this
creature
of
greed
can
only
be
overthrown
by
generosity
let
him
go
the
chiefs
and
the
listened
then
consented
they
commanded
fight
this
thing
with
your
strongest
weapons
cleanliness
and
generosity
the
tenas
tyee
turned
to
his
mother
shall
be
gone
four
days
he
told
her
i
shall
swim
all
that
time
i
have
tried
all
my
life
to
be
generous
but
the
people
say
i
must
be
clean
also
to
fight
this
unclean
thing
while
i
am
gone
put
fresh
furs
on
my
bed
every
day
even
if
i
am
not
here
to
lie
on
them
if
i
know
my
bed
my
body
and
my
heart
are
all
clean
i
can
overcome
this
serpent
bed
shall
have
fresh
furs
every
morning
his
mother
said
simply
the
tenas
tyee
then
stripped
himself
and
with
no
clothing
save
a
buckskin
belt
into
which
he
thrust
his
he
flung
his
lithe
young
body
into
the
sea
but
at
the
end
of
four
days
he
did
not
return
sometimes
his
people
could
see
him
swimming
far
out
in
endeavoring
to
find
the
exact
centre
of
the
serpent
where
lay
its
evil
selfish
heart
but
on
the
fifth
morning
they
saw
him
rise
out
of
the
sea
climb
to
the
summit
of
brockton
point
and
greet
the
rising
sun
with
outstretched
arms
weeks
and
months
went
by
still
the
tenas
tyee
would
swim
daily
searching
for
that
heart
of
greed
and
each
morning
the
sunrise
glinted
on
his
slender
young
body
as
he
stood
with
outstretched
arms
at
the
tip
of
brockton
point
greeting
the
coming
day
and
then
plunging
from
the
summit
into
the
sea
and
at
his
home
on
the
north
shore
his
mother
dressed
his
bed
with
fresh
furs
each
morning
the
seasons
drifted
by
winter
followed
summer
summer
followed
winter
but
it
was
four
years
before
the
tenas
tyee
found
the
centre
of
the
great
oluk
and
plunged
his
into
its
evil
heart
in
its
it
writhed
through
the
narrows
leaving
a
trail
of
blackness
on
the
waters
its
huge
body
began
to
shrink
to
shrivel
it
became
dwarfed
and
withered
until
nothing
but
the
bones
of
its
back
remained
and
they
and
lifeless
soon
sank
to
the
bed
of
the
ocean
leagues
off
from
the
rim
of
land
but
as
the
tenas
tyee
swam
homeward
and
his
clean
young
body
crossed
through
the
black
stain
left
by
the
serpent
the
waters
became
clear
and
blue
and
sparkling
he
had
overcome
even
the
trail
of
the
oluk
when
at
last
he
stood
in
the
doorway
of
his
home
he
said
mother
i
could
not
have
killed
the
monster
of
greed
amongst
my
people
had
you
not
helped
me
by
keeping
one
place
for
me
at
home
fresh
and
clean
for
my
return
she
looked
at
him
as
only
mothers
look
day
these
four
years
fresh
furs
have
i
laid
for
your
bed
sleep
now
and
rest
oh
my
tenas
tyee
she
said
the
chief
unfolded
his
arms
and
his
voice
took
another
tone
as
he
said
what
do
you
call
that
story
a
legend
the
white
people
would
call
it
an
allegory
i
answered
he
shook
his
head
no
savvy
he
smiled
i
explained
as
simply
as
possible
and
with
his
customary
alertness
he
immediately
understood
that
right
he
said
that
what
we
say
it
means
we
squamish
that
greed
is
evil
and
not
clean
like
the
oluk
that
it
must
be
stamped
out
amongst
our
people
killed
by
cleanliness
and
generosity
the
boy
that
overcame
the
serpent
was
both
these
things
what
became
of
this
splendid
boy
i
asked
the
tenas
tyee
oh
some
of
our
old
old
people
say
they
sometimes
see
him
now
standing
on
brockton
point
his
bare
young
arms
outstretched
to
the
rising
sun
he
replied
have
you
ever
seen
him
chief
i
questioned
no
he
answered
simply
but
i
have
never
heard
such
poignant
regret
as
his
wonderful
voice
crowded
into
that
single
word
the
lost
island
yes
said
my
old
tillicum
we
indians
have
lost
many
things
we
have
lost
our
lands
our
forests
our
game
our
fish
we
have
lost
our
ancient
religion
our
ancient
dress
some
of
the
younger
people
have
even
lost
their
fathers
language
and
the
legends
and
traditions
of
their
ancestors
we
can
not
call
those
old
things
back
to
us
they
will
never
come
again
we
may
travel
many
days
up
the
and
look
in
the
silent
places
for
them
they
are
not
there
we
may
paddle
many
moons
on
the
sea
but
our
canoes
will
never
enter
the
channel
that
leads
to
the
yesterdays
of
the
indian
people
these
things
are
lost
just
like
island
of
the
north
arm
they
may
be
somewhere
nearby
but
no
one
can
ever
find
them
but
there
are
many
islands
up
the
north
arm
i
asserted
not
the
island
we
indian
people
have
sought
for
many
tens
of
summers
he
replied
sorrowfully
was
it
ever
there
i
questioned
yes
it
was
there
he
said
my
grandsires
and
my
saw
it
but
that
was
long
ago
my
father
never
saw
it
though
he
spent
many
days
in
many
years
searching
always
searching
for
it
i
am
an
old
man
myself
and
i
have
never
seen
it
though
from
my
youth
i
too
have
searched
sometimes
in
the
stillness
of
the
nights
i
have
paddled
up
in
my
canoe
then
lowering
his
voice
twice
i
have
seen
its
shadow
high
rocky
shores
reaching
as
high
as
the
on
the
mainland
then
tall
pines
and
firs
on
its
summit
like
a
king
crown
as
i
paddled
up
the
arm
one
summer
night
long
ago
the
shadow
of
these
rocks
and
firs
fell
across
my
canoe
across
my
face
and
across
the
waters
beyond
i
turned
rapidly
to
look
there
was
no
island
there
nothing
but
a
wide
stretch
of
waters
on
both
sides
of
me
and
the
moon
almost
directly
overhead
do
say
it
was
the
shore
that
shadowed
me
he
hastened
catching
my
thought
the
moon
was
above
me
my
canoe
scarce
made
a
shadow
on
the
still
waters
no
it
was
not
the
shore
why
do
you
search
for
it
i
lamented
thinking
of
the
old
dreams
in
my
own
life
whose
realization
i
have
never
attained
there
is
something
on
that
island
that
i
want
i
shall
look
for
it
until
i
die
for
it
is
there
he
affirmed
there
was
a
long
silence
between
us
after
that
i
had
learned
to
love
silences
when
with
my
old
tillicum
for
they
always
led
to
a
legend
after
a
time
he
began
voluntarily
it
was
more
than
one
hundred
years
ago
this
great
city
of
vancouver
was
but
the
dream
of
the
sagalie
tyee
god
at
that
time
the
dream
had
not
yet
come
to
the
white
man
only
one
great
indian
knew
that
some
day
a
great
camp
for
palefaces
would
lie
between
false
creek
and
the
inlet
this
dream
haunted
him
it
came
to
him
night
and
day
when
he
was
amid
his
people
laughing
and
feasting
or
when
he
was
alone
in
the
forest
chanting
his
strange
songs
beating
his
hollow
drum
or
shaking
his
wooden
to
gain
more
power
to
cure
the
sick
and
the
dying
of
his
tribe
for
years
this
dream
followed
him
he
grew
to
be
an
old
old
man
yet
always
he
could
hear
voices
strong
and
loud
as
when
they
first
spoke
to
him
in
his
youth
and
they
would
say
the
two
narrow
strips
of
salt
water
the
white
men
will
camp
many
hundreds
of
them
many
thousands
of
them
the
indians
will
learn
their
ways
will
live
as
they
do
will
become
as
they
are
there
will
be
no
more
great
no
more
fights
with
other
powerful
tribes
it
will
be
as
if
the
indians
had
lost
all
bravery
all
courage
all
confidence
he
hated
the
voices
he
hated
the
dream
but
all
his
power
all
his
big
medicine
could
not
drive
them
away
he
was
the
strongest
man
on
all
the
north
pacific
coast
he
was
mighty
and
very
tall
and
his
muscles
were
as
those
of
leloo
the
when
he
is
strongest
to
kill
his
prey
he
could
go
for
many
days
without
food
he
could
fight
the
largest
he
could
overthrow
the
fiercest
grizzly
bear
he
could
paddle
against
the
wildest
winds
and
ride
the
highest
waves
he
could
meet
his
enemies
and
kill
whole
tribes
his
strength
his
courage
his
power
his
bravery
were
those
of
a
giant
he
knew
no
fear
nothing
in
the
sea
or
in
the
forest
nothing
in
the
earth
or
the
sky
could
conquer
him
he
was
fearless
fearless
only
this
haunting
dream
of
the
coming
white
man
camp
he
could
not
drive
away
it
was
the
only
thing
in
life
he
had
tried
to
kill
and
failed
it
drove
him
from
the
feasting
drove
him
from
the
pleasant
lodges
the
fires
the
dancing
the
of
his
people
in
their
camp
by
the
water
edge
where
the
salmon
thronged
and
the
deer
came
down
to
drink
of
the
he
left
the
indian
village
chanting
his
wild
songs
as
he
went
up
through
the
mighty
forests
he
climbed
through
the
trailless
deep
mosses
and
matted
vines
up
to
the
summit
of
what
the
white
men
call
grouse
mountain
for
many
days
he
camped
there
he
ate
no
food
he
drank
no
water
but
sat
and
sang
his
through
the
dark
hours
and
through
the
day
before
him
far
beneath
his
feet
lay
the
narrow
strip
of
land
between
the
two
salt
waters
then
the
sagalie
tyee
gave
him
the
power
to
see
far
into
the
future
he
looked
across
a
hundred
years
just
as
he
looked
across
what
you
call
the
inlet
and
he
saw
mighty
lodges
built
close
together
hundreds
and
thousands
of
them
lodges
of
stone
and
wood
and
long
straight
trails
to
divide
them
he
saw
these
trails
thronging
with
palefaces
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
white
man
on
the
waters
for
it
is
not
silent
like
the
indian
he
saw
the
white
man
trading
posts
saw
the
heard
his
speech
then
the
vision
faded
as
gradually
as
it
came
the
narrow
strip
of
land
was
his
own
forest
once
more
am
old
he
called
in
his
sorrow
and
his
trouble
for
his
people
am
old
o
sagalie
tyee
soon
i
shall
die
and
go
to
the
happy
hunting
grounds
of
my
fathers
let
not
my
strength
die
with
me
keep
living
for
all
time
my
courage
my
bravery
my
fearlessness
keep
them
for
my
people
that
they
may
be
strong
enough
to
endure
the
white
man
rule
keep
my
strength
living
for
them
hide
it
so
that
the
paleface
may
never
find
or
see
it
then
he
came
down
from
the
summit
of
grouse
mountain
still
chanting
his
he
entered
his
canoe
and
paddled
through
the
colors
of
the
setting
sun
far
up
the
north
arm
when
night
fell
he
came
to
an
island
with
misty
shores
of
great
grey
rock
on
its
summit
tall
pines
and
firs
encircled
like
a
crown
as
he
neared
it
he
felt
all
his
strength
his
courage
his
fearlessness
leaving
him
he
could
see
these
things
drift
from
him
on
to
the
island
they
were
as
the
clouds
that
rest
on
the
mountains
and
half
transparent
weak
as
a
woman
he
paddled
back
to
the
indian
village
he
told
them
to
go
and
search
for
island
where
they
would
find
all
his
courage
his
fearlessness
and
his
strength
living
living
forever
he
slept
then
but
in
the
morning
he
did
not
awake
since
then
our
young
men
and
our
old
have
searched
for
island
it
is
there
somewhere
up
some
lost
channel
but
we
can
not
find
it
when
we
do
we
will
get
back
all
the
courage
and
bravery
we
had
before
the
white
man
came
for
the
great
said
those
things
never
die
they
live
for
one
children
and
grandchildren
his
voice
ceased
my
whole
heart
went
out
to
him
in
his
longing
for
the
lost
island
i
thought
of
all
the
splendid
courage
i
knew
him
to
possess
so
made
answer
but
you
say
that
the
shadow
of
this
island
has
fallen
upon
you
is
it
not
so
tillicum
yes
he
said
half
mournfully
but
only
the
shadow
point
grey
have
you
ever
sailed
around
point
grey
asked
a
young
squamish
tillicum
of
mine
who
often
comes
to
see
me
to
share
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
taste
of
that
otherwise
i
should
eat
in
solitude
no
i
admitted
i
had
not
had
that
pleasure
for
i
did
not
know
the
uncertain
waters
of
english
bay
sufficiently
well
to
venture
about
its
headlands
in
my
frail
canoe
some
day
perhaps
next
summer
i
take
you
there
in
a
and
show
you
the
big
rock
at
the
of
the
point
it
is
a
strange
rock
we
indian
people
call
it
homolsom
what
an
odd
name
i
commented
is
it
a
squamish
word
it
does
not
sound
to
me
like
one
it
is
not
altogether
squamish
but
half
fraser
river
language
the
point
was
the
between
the
grounds
and
waters
of
the
two
tribes
so
they
agreed
to
make
the
name
from
the
two
languages
i
suggested
more
tea
and
as
he
sipped
it
he
told
me
the
legend
that
few
of
the
younger
indians
know
that
he
believes
the
story
himself
is
beyond
question
for
many
times
he
admitted
having
tested
the
virtues
of
this
rock
and
it
had
never
once
failed
him
all
people
that
have
to
do
with
are
superstitious
about
some
things
and
i
freely
acknowledge
that
times
innumerable
i
have
whistled
up
a
wind
when
dead
calm
threatened
or
stuck
a
in
the
mast
and
afterwards
watched
with
great
contentment
the
idle
sail
fill
and
the
canoe
pull
out
to
a
light
breeze
so
perhaps
i
am
prejudiced
in
favor
of
this
legend
of
homolsom
rock
for
it
strikes
a
very
responsive
chord
in
that
portion
of
my
heart
that
has
always
throbbed
for
the
sea
you
know
began
my
young
tillicum
that
only
waters
unspoiled
by
human
hands
can
be
of
any
benefit
one
gains
no
strength
by
swimming
in
any
waters
heated
or
boiled
by
fires
that
men
build
to
grow
strong
and
wise
one
must
swim
in
the
natural
rivers
the
mountain
torrents
the
sea
just
as
the
sagalie
tyee
made
them
their
virtues
die
when
human
beings
try
to
improve
them
by
heating
or
distilling
or
placing
even
tea
in
them
and
so
what
makes
homolsom
rock
so
full
of
medicine
is
that
the
waters
that
wash
up
about
it
are
straight
from
the
sea
made
by
the
hand
of
the
great
tyee
and
unspoiled
by
the
hand
of
man
it
was
not
always
there
that
great
rock
drawing
its
strength
and
its
wonderful
power
from
the
seas
for
it
too
was
once
a
great
tyee
who
ruled
a
mighty
tract
of
waters
he
was
god
of
all
the
waters
that
wash
the
coast
of
the
gulf
of
georgia
of
puget
sound
of
the
straits
of
juan
de
fuca
of
the
waters
that
beat
against
even
the
west
coast
of
vancouver
island
and
of
all
the
channels
that
cut
between
the
charlotte
islands
he
was
tyee
of
the
west
wind
and
his
storms
and
tempests
were
so
mighty
that
the
sagalie
tyee
himself
could
not
control
the
havoc
that
he
created
he
warred
upon
all
fishing
craft
he
demolished
canoes
and
sent
men
to
graves
in
the
sea
he
uprooted
forests
and
drove
the
surf
on
shore
heavy
with
wreckage
of
despoiled
trees
and
with
beaten
and
bruised
fish
he
did
all
this
to
reveal
his
powers
for
he
was
cruel
and
hard
of
heart
and
he
would
laugh
and
defy
the
sagalie
tyee
and
looking
up
to
the
sky
he
would
call
how
powerful
i
am
how
mighty
how
strong
i
am
as
great
as
you
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
sagalie
tyee
in
the
persons
of
the
four
men
came
in
the
great
canoe
up
over
the
rim
of
the
pacific
in
that
age
thousands
of
years
ago
when
they
turned
the
evil
into
stone
and
the
kindly
into
trees
said
the
god
of
the
west
wind
can
show
how
great
i
am
i
shall
blow
a
tempest
that
these
men
may
not
land
on
my
coast
they
shall
not
ride
my
seas
and
sounds
and
channels
in
safety
i
shall
wreck
them
and
send
their
bodies
into
the
great
deeps
and
i
shall
be
sagalie
tyee
in
their
place
and
ruler
of
all
the
world
so
the
god
of
the
west
wind
blew
forth
his
tempests
the
waves
arose
mountain
high
the
seas
lashed
and
thundered
along
the
shores
the
roar
of
his
mighty
breath
could
be
heard
wrenching
giant
limbs
from
the
forest
trees
whistling
down
the
canyons
and
dealing
death
and
destruction
for
leagues
and
leagues
along
the
coast
but
the
canoe
containing
the
four
men
rode
upright
through
all
the
heights
and
hollows
of
the
seething
ocean
no
curling
crest
or
sullen
depth
could
wreck
that
magic
craft
for
the
hearts
it
bore
were
filled
with
kindness
for
the
human
race
and
kindness
can
not
die
it
was
all
rock
and
dense
forest
and
unpeopled
only
wild
animals
and
sought
the
shelter
it
provided
from
the
terrors
of
the
west
wind
but
he
drove
them
out
in
sullen
anger
and
made
on
this
strip
of
land
his
last
stand
against
the
four
men
the
paleface
calls
the
place
point
grey
but
the
indians
yet
speak
of
it
as
battle
ground
of
the
west
wind
all
his
mighty
forces
he
now
brought
to
bear
against
the
oncoming
canoe
he
swept
great
hurricanes
about
the
stony
ledges
he
caused
the
sea
to
beat
and
swirl
in
tempestuous
fury
along
its
narrow
fastnesses
but
the
canoe
came
nearer
and
nearer
invincible
as
those
shores
and
stronger
than
death
itself
as
the
bow
touched
the
land
the
four
men
arose
and
commanded
the
west
wind
to
cease
his
and
mighty
though
he
had
been
his
voice
trembled
and
sobbed
itself
into
a
gentle
breeze
then
fell
to
a
whispering
note
then
faded
into
exquisite
silence
you
evil
one
with
the
unkind
heart
cried
the
four
men
have
been
too
great
a
god
for
even
the
sagalie
tyee
to
obliterate
you
forever
but
you
shall
live
on
live
now
to
serve
not
to
hinder
mankind
you
shall
turn
into
stone
where
you
now
stand
and
you
shall
rise
only
as
men
wish
you
to
your
life
from
this
day
shall
be
for
the
good
of
man
for
when
the
fisherman
sails
are
idle
and
his
lodge
is
leagues
away
you
shall
fill
those
sails
and
blow
his
craft
free
in
whatever
direction
he
desires
you
shall
stand
where
you
are
through
all
the
thousands
upon
thousands
of
years
to
come
and
he
who
touches
you
with
his
shall
have
his
desire
of
a
breeze
to
carry
him
home
my
young
tillicum
had
finished
his
tradition
and
his
great
solemn
eyes
regarded
me
i
wish
you
could
see
homolsom
rock
he
said
for
that
is
he
who
was
once
the
tyee
of
the
west
wind
were
you
ever
becalmed
around
point
grey
i
asked
irrelevantly
often
he
replied
but
i
paddle
up
to
the
rock
and
touch
it
with
the
tip
of
my
and
no
matter
which
way
i
want
to
go
the
wind
will
blow
free
for
me
if
i
wait
a
little
while
i
suppose
your
people
all
do
this
i
replied
yes
all
of
them
he
answered
they
have
done
it
for
hundreds
of
years
you
see
the
power
in
it
is
just
as
great
now
as
at
first
for
the
rock
feeds
every
day
on
the
unspoiled
sea
that
the
sagalie
tyee
made
the
tulameen
trail
did
you
ever
holiday
through
the
valley
lands
of
the
dry
belt
ever
spend
days
and
days
in
a
swinging
swaying
coach
behind
a
when
curly
or
nicola
ned
held
the
ribbons
and
tooled
his
knowing
little
leaders
and
wheelers
down
those
horrifying
that
wind
like
russet
skeins
of
cobweb
through
the
heights
and
depths
of
the
okanagan
the
nicola
and
the
similkameen
countries
if
so
you
have
listened
to
the
call
of
the
skookum
chuck
as
the
chinook
speakers
call
the
rollicking
tumbling
streams
that
sing
their
way
through
the
canyons
with
a
music
so
dulcet
so
insistent
that
for
many
moons
the
echo
of
it
lingers
in
your
listening
ears
and
you
will
through
all
the
years
to
come
hear
the
voices
of
those
calling
you
to
return
but
the
most
haunting
of
all
the
melodies
is
the
warbling
laughter
of
the
tulameen
its
delicate
note
is
far
more
powerful
more
than
the
throaty
thunders
of
niagara
that
is
why
the
indians
of
the
nicola
country
still
cling
to
their
story
that
the
tulameen
carries
the
spirit
of
a
young
girl
enmeshed
in
the
wonders
of
its
winding
course
a
spirit
that
can
never
free
itself
from
the
canyons
to
rise
above
the
heights
and
follow
its
fellows
to
the
happy
hunting
grounds
but
which
is
contented
to
entwine
its
laughter
its
sobs
its
lonely
whispers
its
still
lonelier
call
for
companionship
with
the
wild
music
of
the
waters
that
sing
forever
beneath
the
western
stars
as
your
horses
plod
up
and
up
the
almost
perpendicular
trail
that
leads
out
of
the
nicola
valley
to
the
summit
a
paradise
of
beauty
outspreads
at
your
feet
the
color
is
indescribable
in
words
the
atmosphere
thrills
you
youth
and
the
pulse
of
rioting
blood
are
yours
again
until
as
you
near
the
heights
you
become
strangely
calmed
by
the
voiceless
silence
of
it
all
a
silence
so
holy
that
it
seems
the
whole
world
about
you
is
swinging
its
censer
before
an
altar
in
some
dim
remote
cathedral
the
of
the
tulameen
are
yet
very
far
away
across
the
summit
but
the
heights
of
the
nicola
are
the
silent
prayer
that
holds
the
human
soul
before
the
first
great
chords
swell
down
from
the
in
this
first
long
climb
up
miles
and
miles
of
trail
even
the
staccato
of
the
drivers
long
whip
is
hushed
he
lets
his
animals
pick
their
own
way
but
once
across
the
summit
he
gathers
the
reins
in
his
steely
fingers
gives
a
low
quick
whistle
the
whiplash
curls
about
the
ears
of
the
leaders
and
the
plunge
down
the
dip
of
the
mountain
begins
every
foot
of
the
way
is
done
at
a
gallop
the
coach
rocks
and
swings
as
it
dashes
through
a
trail
from
the
heart
of
the
forest
at
times
the
angles
are
so
abrupt
that
you
can
not
see
the
heads
of
the
leaders
as
they
swing
around
the
grey
crags
that
almost
scrape
the
tires
on
the
left
while
within
a
foot
of
the
rim
of
the
trail
the
right
wheels
whirl
along
the
edge
of
a
yawning
canyon
the
rhythm
of
the
the
recurrent
low
whistle
and
crack
of
the
whiplash
the
occasional
rattle
of
pebbles
showering
down
to
the
depths
loosened
by
rioting
wheels
have
broken
the
sacred
silence
yet
above
all
those
nearby
sounds
there
seems
to
be
an
indistinct
murmur
which
grows
sweeter
more
musical
as
you
gain
the
base
of
the
mountains
where
it
rises
above
all
harsher
notes
it
is
the
voice
of
the
restless
tulameen
as
it
dances
and
laughs
through
the
rocky
throat
of
the
canyon
three
hundred
feet
below
then
following
the
song
comes
a
glimpse
of
the
river
itself
in
the
film
of
its
countless
rapids
its
showers
of
waterfalls
it
is
as
beautiful
to
look
at
as
to
listen
to
and
it
is
here
where
the
trail
winds
about
and
above
it
for
leagues
that
the
indians
say
it
caught
the
spirit
of
the
maiden
that
is
still
interlaced
in
its
loveliness
it
was
in
one
of
the
terrible
battles
that
raged
between
the
valley
tribes
before
the
white
man
footprints
were
seen
along
these
trails
none
can
now
tell
the
cause
of
this
warfare
but
the
supposition
is
that
it
was
merely
for
tribal
supremacy
that
primeval
instinct
that
assails
the
savage
in
both
man
and
beast
that
drives
the
to
bloodshed
and
the
leaders
of
buffalo
herds
to
conflict
it
is
the
greed
to
rule
the
one
barbarous
instinct
that
civilization
has
never
yet
been
able
to
eradicate
from
armed
nations
this
war
of
the
tribes
of
the
valley
lands
was
of
years
in
duration
men
fought
and
women
mourned
and
children
wept
as
all
have
done
since
time
began
it
seemed
an
unequal
battle
for
the
old
experienced
chief
and
his
two
astute
sons
were
pitted
against
a
single
young
tulameen
brave
both
factors
had
their
loyal
followers
both
were
indomitable
as
to
courage
and
bravery
both
were
determined
and
ambitious
both
were
skilled
fighters
but
on
the
older
man
side
were
experience
and
two
other
wary
strategic
brains
to
help
him
while
on
the
younger
was
but
the
advantage
of
splendid
youth
and
unconquerable
persistence
but
at
every
pitched
battle
at
every
skirmish
at
every
conflict
the
younger
man
gained
little
by
little
the
older
man
lost
step
by
step
the
experience
of
age
was
gradually
but
inevitably
giving
way
to
the
strength
and
enthusiasm
of
youth
then
one
day
they
met
face
to
face
and
alone
the
old
chief
the
young
brave
it
was
an
unequal
combat
and
at
the
close
of
a
brief
but
violent
struggle
the
younger
had
brought
the
older
to
his
knees
standing
over
him
with
knife
the
tulameen
brave
laughed
sneeringly
and
said
would
you
my
enemy
have
this
victory
as
your
own
if
so
i
give
it
to
you
but
in
return
for
my
submission
i
demand
of
you
your
daughter
for
an
instant
the
old
chief
looked
in
wonderment
at
his
conqueror
he
thought
of
his
daughter
only
as
a
child
who
played
about
the
or
sat
obediently
beside
her
mother
in
the
lodge
stitching
her
little
moccasins
or
weaving
her
little
baskets
my
daughter
he
answered
sternly
my
daughter
who
is
barely
out
of
her
own
give
her
to
you
whose
hands
are
with
the
killing
of
a
score
of
my
tribe
you
ask
for
this
thing
i
do
not
ask
it
replied
the
young
brave
i
demand
it
i
have
seen
the
girl
and
i
shall
have
her
the
old
chief
sprang
to
his
feet
and
spat
out
his
refusal
keep
your
victory
and
i
keep
my
though
he
knew
he
was
not
only
defying
his
enemy
but
defying
death
as
well
the
tulameen
laughed
lightly
easily
i
shall
not
kill
the
sire
of
my
wife
he
taunted
one
more
battle
must
we
have
but
your
will
come
to
me
then
he
took
his
victorious
way
up
the
trail
while
the
old
chief
walked
with
slow
and
springless
step
down
into
the
canyon
the
next
morning
the
chief
daughter
was
loitering
along
the
heights
listening
to
the
singing
river
and
sometimes
leaning
over
the
precipice
to
watch
its
curling
eddies
and
dancing
waterfalls
suddenly
she
heard
a
slight
rustle
as
though
some
passing
wing
had
clipt
the
air
then
at
her
feet
there
fell
a
slender
delicately
shaped
arrow
it
fell
with
spent
force
and
her
indian
woodcraft
told
her
it
had
been
shot
to
her
not
at
her
she
started
like
a
wild
animal
then
her
quick
eye
caught
the
outline
of
a
handsome
erect
figure
that
stood
on
the
heights
across
the
river
she
did
not
know
him
as
her
father
enemy
she
only
saw
him
to
be
young
stalwart
and
of
extraordinary
manly
beauty
the
spirit
of
youth
and
of
a
certain
savage
coquetry
awoke
within
her
quickly
she
fitted
one
of
her
own
dainty
arrows
to
the
and
sent
it
winging
across
the
narrow
canyon
it
fell
spent
at
his
feet
and
he
knew
she
had
shot
it
to
him
not
at
him
next
morning
she
crept
noiselessly
to
the
brink
of
the
heights
would
she
see
him
again
that
handsome
brave
would
he
speed
another
arrow
to
her
she
had
not
yet
emerged
from
the
tangle
of
forest
before
it
fell
its
flight
heralding
its
coming
near
the
feathered
end
was
tied
a
tassel
of
beautiful
she
took
from
her
wrist
a
string
of
shell
beads
fastened
it
to
one
of
her
little
arrows
and
winged
it
across
the
canyon
as
yesterday
the
following
morning
before
leaving
the
lodge
she
fastened
the
tassel
of
in
her
straight
black
hair
would
he
see
them
but
no
arrow
fell
at
her
feet
that
day
but
a
dearer
message
was
there
on
the
brink
of
the
precipice
he
himself
awaited
her
coming
he
who
had
never
left
her
thoughts
since
that
first
arrow
came
to
her
from
his
his
eyes
burned
with
warm
fires
as
she
approached
but
his
lips
said
simply
i
have
crossed
the
tulameen
river
together
they
stood
side
by
side
and
looked
down
at
the
depths
before
them
watching
in
silence
the
little
torrent
rollicking
and
roystering
over
its
boulders
and
crags
that
is
my
country
he
said
looking
across
the
river
this
is
the
country
of
your
father
and
of
your
brothers
they
are
my
enemies
i
return
to
my
own
shore
will
you
come
with
me
she
looked
up
into
his
handsome
young
face
so
this
was
her
father
foe
the
dreaded
tulameen
will
you
come
he
repeated
i
will
come
she
whispered
it
was
in
the
dark
of
the
moon
and
through
the
kindly
night
he
led
her
far
up
the
rocky
shores
to
the
narrow
belt
of
quiet
waters
where
they
crossed
in
silence
into
his
own
country
a
week
a
month
a
long
golden
summer
slipped
by
but
the
insulted
old
chief
and
his
enraged
sons
failed
to
find
her
then
one
morning
as
the
lovers
walked
together
on
the
heights
above
the
far
upper
reaches
of
the
river
even
the
eyes
of
the
tulameen
failed
to
detect
the
lurking
enemy
across
the
narrow
canyon
crouched
and
crept
the
two
outwitted
brothers
of
the
at
his
side
their
arrows
were
on
their
their
hearts
on
fire
with
hatred
and
vengeance
like
two
birds
of
prey
those
arrows
sped
across
the
laughing
river
but
before
they
found
their
mark
in
the
breast
of
the
victorious
tulameen
the
girl
had
unconsciously
stepped
before
him
with
a
little
sigh
she
slipped
into
his
arms
her
brothers
arrows
buried
into
her
soft
brown
flesh
it
was
many
a
moon
before
his
avenging
hand
succeeded
in
slaying
the
old
chief
and
those
two
hated
sons
of
his
but
when
this
was
finally
done
the
handsome
young
tulameen
left
his
people
his
tribe
his
country
and
went
into
the
far
north
for
he
said
as
he
sang
his
farewell
my
heart
lies
dead
in
the
tulameen
river
but
the
spirit
of
his
still
sings
through
the
canyon
its
song
blending
with
the
music
of
that
river
in
all
the
great
valleys
of
the
dry
belt
that
is
why
this
laughter
the
sobbing
murmur
of
the
beautiful
tulameen
will
haunt
for
evermore
the
ear
that
has
once
listened
to
its
song
the
grey
archway
the
steamer
like
a
huge
shuttle
wove
in
and
out
among
the
countless
small
islands
its
long
trailing
scarf
of
grey
smoke
hung
heavily
along
the
uncertain
shores
casting
a
shadow
over
the
pearly
waters
of
the
pacific
which
swung
lazily
from
rock
to
rock
in
indescribable
beauty
after
dinner
i
wandered
astern
with
the
traveller
hope
of
seeing
the
beauties
of
a
typical
northern
sunset
and
by
some
happy
chance
i
placed
my
near
an
old
tillicum
who
was
leaning
on
the
rail
his
pipe
between
his
thin
curved
lips
his
brown
hands
clasped
idly
his
sombre
eyes
looking
far
out
to
sea
as
though
they
searched
the
future
or
was
it
that
they
were
seeing
the
past
tillicum
i
greeted
he
glanced
round
and
half
smiled
tillicum
he
replied
with
the
warmth
of
friendliness
i
have
always
met
with
among
the
pacific
tribes
i
drew
my
nearer
to
him
and
he
acknowledged
the
action
with
another
half
smile
but
did
not
stir
from
his
entrenchment
remaining
as
if
hedged
about
with
an
inviolable
fortress
of
exclusiveness
yet
i
knew
that
my
chinook
salutation
would
be
a
drawbridge
by
which
i
might
hope
to
cross
the
moat
into
his
castle
of
silence
he
took
his
time
before
continuing
the
acquaintance
then
he
began
in
most
excellent
english
you
do
not
know
these
northern
waters
i
shook
my
head
after
many
moments
he
leaned
forward
looking
along
the
curve
of
the
deck
up
the
channels
and
narrows
we
were
threading
to
a
broad
strip
of
waters
off
the
port
bow
then
he
pointed
with
that
peculiar
thoroughly
indian
gesture
of
the
palm
uppermost
do
you
see
it
over
there
the
small
island
it
rests
on
the
edge
of
the
water
like
a
grey
gull
it
took
my
unaccustomed
eyes
some
moments
to
discern
it
then
all
at
once
i
caught
its
outline
veiled
in
the
mists
of
distance
grey
cobwebby
dreamy
yes
i
replied
i
see
it
now
you
will
tell
me
of
it
tillicum
he
gave
a
swift
glance
at
my
dark
skin
then
nodded
you
are
one
of
us
he
said
with
evidently
no
thought
of
a
possible
contradiction
and
you
will
understand
or
i
should
not
tell
you
you
will
not
smile
at
the
story
for
you
are
one
of
us
i
am
one
of
you
and
i
shall
understand
i
answered
it
was
a
full
before
we
neared
the
island
yet
neither
of
us
spoke
during
that
time
then
as
the
grey
gull
shaped
itself
into
rock
and
tree
and
crag
i
noticed
in
the
very
centre
a
stupendous
pile
of
stone
lifting
itself
skyward
without
fissure
or
cleft
but
a
peculiar
haziness
about
the
base
made
me
peer
narrowly
to
catch
the
perfect
outline
it
is
the
archway
he
explained
simply
only
then
did
i
grasp
the
singular
formation
before
us
the
rock
was
a
perfect
archway
through
which
we
could
see
the
placid
pacific
shimmering
in
the
growing
colors
of
the
coming
sunset
at
the
opposite
rim
of
the
island
what
a
remarkable
whim
of
nature
i
exclaimed
but
his
brown
hand
was
laid
in
a
contradictory
grasp
on
my
arm
and
he
snatched
up
my
comment
almost
with
impatience
no
it
was
not
nature
he
said
that
is
the
reason
i
say
you
will
understand
you
are
one
of
us
you
will
know
what
i
tell
you
is
true
the
great
tyee
did
not
make
that
archway
it
was
here
his
voice
lowered
it
was
magic
red
man
medicine
and
magic
you
savvy
yes
i
said
tell
me
for
i
savvy
long
time
ago
he
began
stumbling
into
a
english
language
because
i
think
of
the
atmosphere
and
environment
long
before
you
were
born
or
your
father
or
grandfather
or
even
his
father
this
strange
thing
happened
it
is
a
story
for
women
to
hear
to
remember
women
are
the
future
mothers
of
the
tribe
and
we
of
the
pacific
coast
hold
such
in
high
regard
in
great
reverence
the
women
who
are
mothers
they
are
the
important
ones
we
say
warriors
fighters
brave
men
fearless
daughters
owe
their
qualities
to
these
mothers
eh
is
it
not
always
so
i
nodded
silently
the
island
was
swinging
nearer
to
us
the
grey
archway
loomed
almost
above
us
the
mysticism
crowded
close
it
enveloped
me
caressed
me
appealed
to
me
and
i
hinted
and
he
proceeded
this
archway
is
a
story
of
mothers
of
magic
of
witchcraft
of
warriors
of
love
an
indian
rarely
uses
the
word
love
and
when
he
does
it
expresses
every
quality
every
attribute
every
intensity
emotion
and
passion
embraced
in
those
four
little
letters
surely
this
was
an
exceptional
story
i
was
to
hear
i
did
not
answer
only
looked
across
the
pulsing
waters
toward
the
grey
archway
which
the
sinking
sun
was
touching
with
soft
pastels
tints
one
could
give
no
name
to
beauties
impossible
to
describe
you
have
not
heard
of
yaada
he
questioned
then
fortunately
he
continued
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
well
knew
that
i
had
never
heard
of
yaada
so
why
not
begin
without
preliminary
to
tell
me
of
her
so
yaada
was
the
loveliest
daughter
of
the
haida
tribe
young
braves
from
all
the
islands
from
the
mainland
from
the
upper
skeena
country
came
hoping
to
carry
her
to
their
lodges
but
they
always
returned
alone
she
was
the
most
desired
of
all
the
island
maidens
beautiful
brave
modest
the
daughter
of
her
own
mother
but
there
was
a
great
man
a
very
great
man
a
skilful
powerful
influential
old
deplorably
old
and
very
very
rich
he
said
shall
be
my
wife
and
there
was
a
young
fisherman
handsome
loyal
boyish
poor
oh
very
poor
and
gloriously
young
and
he
too
said
shall
be
my
wife
but
yaada
mother
sat
apart
and
thought
and
dreamed
as
mothers
will
she
said
to
herself
great
has
power
has
vast
riches
and
wonderful
magic
why
not
give
her
to
him
but
ulka
has
the
boy
heart
the
boy
beauty
he
is
very
brave
very
strong
why
not
give
her
to
him
but
the
laws
of
the
great
haida
tribe
prevailed
its
wise
men
said
the
girl
to
the
greatest
man
give
her
to
the
most
powerful
the
richest
the
man
of
magic
must
have
his
choice
but
at
this
the
mother
heart
grew
as
wax
in
the
summer
sunshine
it
is
a
strange
quality
that
mothers
hearts
are
made
of
her
to
the
best
man
the
man
her
heart
holds
highest
said
this
haida
mother
then
yaada
spoke
am
the
daughter
of
my
tribe
i
would
judge
of
men
by
their
excellence
he
who
proves
most
worthy
i
shall
marry
it
is
not
riches
that
make
a
good
husband
it
is
not
beauty
that
makes
a
good
father
for
one
children
let
me
and
my
tribe
see
some
proof
of
the
excellence
of
these
two
men
then
only
shall
i
choose
who
is
to
be
the
father
of
my
children
let
us
have
a
trial
of
their
skill
let
them
show
me
how
evil
or
how
beautiful
is
the
inside
of
their
hearts
let
each
of
them
throw
a
stone
with
some
intent
some
purpose
in
their
hearts
he
who
makes
the
noblest
mark
may
call
me
wife
alas
wailed
the
haida
mother
casting
of
stones
does
not
show
worth
it
but
shows
prowess
i
have
implored
the
sagalie
tyee
of
my
father
and
of
his
fathers
before
him
to
help
me
to
judge
between
them
by
this
means
said
the
girl
they
must
cast
the
stones
in
this
way
only
shall
i
see
their
innermost
hearts
the
never
looked
so
old
as
at
that
moment
so
hopelessly
old
so
wrinkled
so
palsied
he
was
no
mate
for
yaada
ulka
never
looked
so
in
his
young
beauty
so
gloriously
young
so
courageous
the
girl
looking
at
him
loved
him
almost
was
she
placing
her
hand
in
his
but
the
spirit
of
her
forefathers
halted
her
she
had
spoken
the
word
she
must
abide
by
it
she
commanded
into
his
shrivelled
fingers
the
great
took
a
small
round
stone
chanting
strange
words
of
magic
all
the
while
his
greedy
eyes
were
on
the
girl
his
greedy
thoughts
about
her
into
his
strong
young
fingers
ulka
took
a
smooth
flat
stone
his
handsome
eyes
were
lowered
in
boyish
modesty
his
thoughts
were
worshipping
her
the
great
cast
his
missile
first
it
swept
through
the
air
like
a
shaft
of
lightning
striking
the
great
rock
with
a
force
that
shattered
it
at
the
touch
of
that
stone
the
archway
opened
and
has
remained
open
to
this
day
wonderful
power
and
magic
clamored
the
entire
tribe
very
rocks
do
his
bidding
but
yaada
stood
with
eyes
that
burned
in
agony
ulka
could
never
command
such
magic
she
knew
it
but
at
her
side
ulka
was
standing
erect
tall
slender
and
beautiful
but
just
as
he
cast
his
missile
the
evil
voice
of
the
old
began
a
still
more
evil
incantation
he
fixed
his
poisonous
eyes
on
the
younger
man
eyes
with
hideous
magic
in
their
depths
and
enchanted
with
medicine
the
stone
left
ulka
fingers
for
a
second
it
flew
forth
in
a
straight
line
then
as
the
evil
voice
of
the
old
man
grew
louder
in
its
incantations
the
stone
curved
magic
had
waylaid
the
strong
arm
of
the
young
brave
the
stone
poised
an
instant
above
the
forehead
of
yaada
mother
then
dropped
with
the
weight
of
many
mountains
and
the
last
long
sleep
fell
upon
her
of
my
mother
stormed
the
girl
her
suffering
eyes
fixed
upon
the
i
now
see
your
black
heart
through
your
black
magic
through
good
magic
you
cut
the
grey
archway
but
your
evil
magic
you
used
upon
young
ulka
i
saw
your
wicked
eyes
upon
him
i
heard
your
wicked
incantations
i
know
your
wicked
heart
you
used
your
heartless
magic
in
hope
of
winning
me
in
hope
of
making
him
an
outcast
of
the
tribe
you
cared
not
for
my
sorrowing
heart
my
motherless
life
to
come
then
turning
to
the
tribe
she
demanded
of
you
saw
his
evil
eyes
fixed
on
ulka
who
of
you
heard
his
evil
song
and
and
came
voice
after
voice
very
air
is
poisoned
that
we
breathe
about
him
they
shouted
young
man
is
blameless
his
heart
is
as
the
sun
but
the
man
who
has
used
his
evil
magic
has
a
heart
black
and
cold
as
the
hours
before
the
dawn
then
yaada
voice
arose
in
a
strange
sweet
sorrowful
chant
my
feet
shall
walk
no
more
upon
this
island
with
its
great
grey
archway
my
mother
sleeps
forever
on
this
island
with
its
great
grey
archway
my
heart
would
break
without
her
on
this
island
with
its
great
grey
archway
my
life
was
of
her
life
upon
this
island
with
its
great
grey
archway
my
mother
soul
has
wandered
from
this
island
with
its
great
grey
archway
my
feet
must
follow
hers
beyond
this
island
with
its
great
grey
archway
as
yaada
chanted
and
wailed
her
farewell
she
moved
slowly
towards
the
edge
of
the
cliff
on
its
brink
she
hovered
a
moment
with
outstretched
arms
as
a
sea
gull
poises
on
its
weight
then
she
called
my
ulka
your
hand
is
innocent
of
wrong
it
was
the
evil
magic
of
your
rival
that
slew
my
mother
i
must
go
to
her
even
you
can
not
keep
me
here
will
you
stay
or
come
with
me
oh
my
ulka
the
slender
gloriously
young
boy
sprang
toward
her
their
hands
closed
one
within
the
other
for
a
second
they
poised
on
the
brink
of
the
rocks
radiant
as
stars
then
together
they
plunged
into
the
sea
the
legend
was
ended
long
ago
we
had
passed
the
island
with
its
grey
archway
it
was
melting
into
the
twilight
far
astern
as
i
brooded
over
this
strange
tale
of
a
daughter
devotion
i
watched
the
sea
and
sky
for
something
that
would
give
me
a
clue
to
the
inevitable
sequel
that
the
tillicum
like
all
his
race
was
surely
withholding
until
the
opportune
moment
something
flashed
through
the
darkening
waters
not
a
from
the
steamer
i
leaned
forward
watching
it
intently
two
silvery
fish
were
making
a
succession
of
little
leaps
and
plunges
along
the
surface
of
the
sea
their
bodies
catching
the
last
tints
of
sunset
like
flashing
jewels
i
looked
at
the
tillicum
quickly
he
was
watching
me
a
world
of
anxiety
in
his
eyes
and
those
two
silvery
fish
i
questioned
he
smiled
the
anxious
look
vanished
i
was
right
he
said
you
do
know
us
and
our
ways
for
you
are
one
of
us
yes
those
fish
are
seen
only
in
these
waters
there
are
never
but
two
of
them
they
are
yaada
and
her
mate
seeking
for
the
soul
of
the
haida
woman
her
mother
deadman
island
it
is
dusk
on
the
lost
lagoon
and
we
two
dreaming
the
dusk
away
beneath
the
drift
of
a
twilight
grey
beneath
the
drowse
of
an
ending
day
and
the
curve
of
a
golden
moon
it
is
dark
in
the
lost
lagoon
and
gone
are
the
depths
of
haunting
blue
the
grouping
gulls
and
the
old
canoe
the
singing
firs
and
the
dusk
and
you
and
gone
is
the
golden
moon
o
lure
of
the
lost
lagoon
i
dream
that
my
paddle
blurs
the
purple
shade
where
the
seaweed
stirs
i
hear
the
call
of
the
singing
firs
in
the
hush
of
the
golden
moon
for
many
minutes
we
stood
silently
leaning
on
the
western
rail
of
the
bridge
as
we
watched
the
sunset
across
that
beautiful
little
basin
of
water
known
as
coal
harbor
i
have
always
resented
that
jarring
unattractive
name
for
years
ago
when
i
first
plied
paddle
across
the
gunwale
of
a
light
little
canoe
and
idled
about
its
margin
i
named
the
sheltered
little
cove
the
lost
lagoon
this
was
just
to
please
my
own
fancy
for
as
that
perfect
summer
month
drifted
on
the
tides
left
the
harbor
devoid
of
water
at
my
favorite
canoeing
hour
and
my
pet
was
lost
for
many
days
hence
my
fancy
to
call
it
the
lost
lagoon
but
the
chief
immediately
adopted
the
name
at
least
when
he
spoke
of
the
place
to
me
and
as
we
watched
the
sun
slip
behind
the
rim
of
firs
he
expressed
the
wish
that
his
were
here
instead
of
lying
beached
at
the
farther
side
of
the
park
if
canoe
was
here
you
and
i
we
paddle
close
to
shores
all
your
lost
lagoon
we
make
track
just
like
then
we
paddle
under
this
bridge
and
go
channel
between
deadman
island
and
park
then
where
cannon
speak
time
at
nine
then
inlet
to
indian
side
of
narrows
i
turned
to
look
eastward
following
in
fancy
the
course
he
had
sketched
the
waters
were
still
as
the
footsteps
of
the
oncoming
twilight
and
floating
in
a
pool
of
soft
purple
deadman
island
rested
like
a
large
circle
of
have
you
ever
been
on
it
he
asked
as
he
caught
my
gaze
centering
on
the
irregular
outline
of
the
island
pines
i
have
prowled
the
length
and
depth
of
it
i
told
him
climbed
over
every
rock
on
its
shores
crept
under
every
tangled
growth
of
its
interior
explored
its
overgrown
trails
and
more
than
once
nearly
got
lost
in
its
very
heart
yes
he
half
laughed
it
pretty
wild
not
much
good
for
anything
people
seem
to
think
it
valuable
i
said
there
is
a
lot
of
litigation
of
fighting
going
on
now
about
it
oh
that
the
way
always
he
said
as
though
speaking
of
a
long
accepted
fact
always
fight
over
that
place
hundreds
of
years
ago
they
fight
about
it
indian
people
they
say
hundreds
of
years
to
come
everybody
will
still
fight
never
be
settled
what
that
place
is
who
it
belong
to
who
has
right
to
it
no
never
settle
deadman
island
always
mean
fight
for
someone
so
the
indians
fought
amongst
themselves
about
it
i
remarked
seemingly
without
guile
although
my
ears
tingled
for
the
legend
i
knew
was
coming
fought
like
lynx
at
close
quarters
he
answered
fought
killed
each
other
until
the
island
ran
with
blood
redder
than
that
sunset
and
the
about
it
was
stained
flame
color
it
was
then
my
people
say
that
the
scarlet
was
first
seen
growing
along
this
coast
it
is
a
beautiful
color
the
i
said
it
should
be
fine
color
for
it
was
born
and
grew
from
the
hearts
of
fine
very
fine
people
he
emphasized
we
crossed
to
the
eastern
rail
of
the
bridge
and
stood
watching
the
deep
shadows
that
gathered
slowly
and
silently
about
the
island
i
have
seldom
looked
upon
anything
more
peaceful
the
chief
sighed
we
have
no
such
men
now
no
fighters
like
those
men
no
hearts
no
courage
like
theirs
but
i
tell
you
the
story
you
understand
it
then
now
all
peace
all
good
tillicums
even
dead
man
spirit
does
not
fight
now
but
long
time
after
it
happen
those
spirits
fought
and
the
legend
i
ventured
oh
yes
he
replied
as
if
suddenly
returning
to
the
present
from
out
a
far
country
in
the
realm
of
time
indian
people
they
call
it
the
of
the
island
of
dead
men
there
was
war
everywhere
fierce
tribes
from
the
northern
coast
savage
tribes
from
the
south
all
met
here
and
battled
and
raided
burned
and
captured
tortured
and
killed
their
enemies
the
forests
smoked
with
the
narrows
were
choked
with
and
the
sagalie
tyee
he
who
is
a
man
of
peace
turned
his
face
away
from
his
indian
children
about
this
island
there
was
dispute
and
contention
the
from
the
north
claimed
it
as
their
the
from
the
south
laid
equal
claim
to
it
each
wanted
it
as
the
stronghold
of
their
witchcraft
their
magic
great
bands
of
these
met
on
the
small
space
using
every
sorcery
in
their
power
to
drive
their
opponents
away
the
of
the
north
made
their
camp
on
the
northern
rim
of
the
island
those
from
the
south
settled
along
the
southern
edge
looking
towards
what
is
now
the
great
city
of
vancouver
both
factions
danced
chanted
burned
their
magic
powders
built
their
magic
fires
beat
their
magic
rattles
but
neither
would
give
way
yet
neither
conquered
about
them
on
the
waters
on
the
mainlands
raged
the
warfare
of
their
respective
tribes
the
sagalie
tyee
had
forgotten
his
indian
children
after
many
months
the
warriors
on
both
sides
weakened
they
said
the
incantations
of
the
rival
were
bewitching
them
were
making
their
hearts
like
children
and
their
arms
nerveless
as
women
so
friend
and
foe
arose
as
one
man
and
drove
the
from
the
island
hounded
them
down
the
inlet
herded
them
through
the
narrows
and
banished
them
out
to
sea
where
they
took
refuge
on
one
of
the
outer
islands
of
the
gulf
then
the
tribes
once
more
fell
upon
each
other
in
battle
the
warrior
blood
of
the
north
will
always
conquer
they
are
the
stronger
bolder
more
alert
more
keen
the
snows
and
the
ice
of
their
country
make
swifter
pulse
than
the
sleepy
suns
of
the
south
can
awake
in
a
man
their
muscles
are
of
sterner
stuff
their
endurance
greater
yes
the
northern
tribes
will
always
be
victors
but
the
craft
and
the
strategy
of
the
southern
tribes
are
hard
things
to
battle
against
while
those
of
the
north
followed
the
farther
out
to
sea
to
make
sure
of
their
banishment
those
from
the
south
returned
under
cover
of
night
and
seized
the
women
and
children
and
the
old
enfeebled
men
in
their
enemy
camp
transported
them
all
to
the
island
of
dead
men
and
there
held
them
as
captives
their
circled
the
island
like
a
fortification
through
which
drifted
the
sobs
of
the
imprisoned
women
the
mutterings
of
the
aged
men
the
wail
of
little
children
it
would
almost
seem
that
the
chief
knew
that
wonderful
poem
of
the
khan
the
men
of
the
northern
zone
wherein
he
says
if
ever
a
northman
lost
a
throne
did
the
conqueror
come
from
the
south
nay
the
north
shall
ever
be
free
etc
again
and
again
the
men
of
the
north
assailed
that
circle
of
canoes
and
again
and
again
were
repulsed
the
air
was
thick
with
poisoned
arrows
the
water
stained
with
blood
but
day
by
day
the
circle
of
southern
canoes
grew
thinner
and
thinner
the
northern
arrows
were
telling
and
truer
of
aim
canoes
drifted
everywhere
empty
or
worse
still
manned
only
by
dead
men
the
pick
of
the
southern
warriors
had
already
fallen
when
their
greatest
tyee
mounted
a
large
rock
on
the
eastern
shore
brave
and
unmindful
of
a
thousand
weapons
aimed
at
his
heart
he
uplifted
his
hand
palm
outward
the
signal
for
conference
instantly
every
northern
arrow
was
lowered
and
every
northern
ear
listened
for
his
words
men
of
the
upper
coast
he
said
are
more
numerous
than
we
are
your
tribe
is
larger
your
endurance
greater
we
are
growing
hungry
we
are
growing
less
in
numbers
our
captives
your
women
and
children
and
old
men
have
lessened
too
our
stores
of
food
if
you
refuse
our
terms
we
will
yet
fight
to
the
finish
we
will
kill
all
our
captives
before
your
eyes
for
we
can
feed
them
no
longer
or
you
can
have
your
wives
your
mothers
your
fathers
your
children
by
giving
us
for
each
and
every
one
of
them
one
of
your
best
and
bravest
young
warriors
who
will
consent
to
suffer
death
in
their
stead
speak
you
have
your
choice
in
the
northern
canoes
scores
and
scores
of
young
warriors
leapt
to
their
feet
the
air
was
filled
with
glad
cries
with
exultant
shouts
the
whole
world
seemed
to
ring
with
the
voices
of
those
young
men
who
called
loudly
with
glorious
courage
me
but
give
me
back
my
old
father
me
but
spare
to
my
tribe
my
little
sister
me
but
release
my
wife
and
so
the
compact
was
made
two
hundred
heroic
magnificent
young
men
paddled
up
to
the
island
broke
through
the
fortifying
circle
of
canoes
and
stepped
ashore
they
flaunted
their
eagle
plumes
with
the
spirit
and
boldness
of
young
gods
their
shoulders
were
erect
their
step
was
firm
their
hearts
strong
into
their
canoes
they
crowded
the
two
hundred
captives
once
more
their
women
sobbed
their
old
men
muttered
their
children
wailed
but
those
young
gods
never
flinched
never
faltered
their
weak
and
their
feeble
were
saved
what
mattered
to
them
such
a
little
thing
as
death
the
released
captives
were
quickly
surrounded
by
their
own
people
but
the
flower
of
their
splendid
nation
was
in
the
hands
of
their
enemies
those
valorous
young
men
who
thought
so
little
of
life
that
they
willingly
gladly
laid
it
down
to
serve
and
to
save
those
they
loved
and
cared
for
amongst
them
were
warriors
who
had
fought
fifty
battles
and
boys
not
yet
full
grown
who
were
drawing
a
for
the
first
time
but
their
hearts
their
courage
their
were
as
one
out
before
a
long
file
of
southern
warriors
they
stood
their
chins
uplifted
their
eyes
defiant
their
breasts
bared
each
leaned
forward
and
laid
his
weapons
at
his
feet
then
stood
erect
with
empty
hands
and
laughed
forth
his
challenge
to
death
a
thousand
arrows
ripped
the
air
two
hundred
gallant
northern
throats
flung
forth
a
death
cry
exultant
triumphant
as
conquering
kings
then
two
hundred
fearless
northern
hearts
ceased
to
beat
but
in
the
morning
the
southern
tribes
found
the
spot
where
they
fell
peopled
with
flaming
dread
terror
seized
upon
them
they
abandoned
the
island
and
when
night
again
shrouded
them
they
manned
their
canoes
and
noiselessly
slipped
through
the
narrows
turned
their
bows
southward
and
this
knew
them
no
more
what
glorious
men
i
half
whispered
as
the
chief
concluded
the
strange
legend
yes
men
he
echoed
the
white
people
call
it
deadman
island
that
is
their
way
but
we
of
the
squamish
call
it
the
island
of
dead
men
the
clustering
pines
and
the
outlines
of
the
island
margin
were
now
dusky
and
indistinct
peace
peace
lay
over
the
waters
and
the
purple
of
the
summer
twilight
had
turned
to
grey
but
i
knew
that
in
the
depths
of
the
undergrowth
on
deadman
island
there
blossomed
a
flower
of
flaming
beauty
its
colors
were
veiled
in
the
coming
nightfall
but
somewhere
down
in
the
sanctuary
of
its
petals
pulsed
the
heart
blood
of
many
and
valiant
men
a
squamish
legend
of
napoleon
holding
an
important
place
among
the
majority
of
curious
tales
held
in
veneration
by
the
coast
tribes
are
those
of
the
the
monster
appears
and
reappears
with
almost
monotonous
frequency
in
connection
with
history
traditions
legends
and
superstitions
but
perhaps
the
most
wonderful
part
it
ever
played
was
in
the
great
drama
that
held
the
stage
of
europe
and
incidentally
all
the
world
during
the
stormy
days
of
the
first
napoleon
throughout
canada
i
have
never
failed
to
find
an
amazing
knowledge
of
napoleon
bonaparte
amongst
the
very
old
and
uncivilized
indians
perhaps
they
may
be
unfamiliar
with
every
other
historical
character
from
adam
down
but
they
will
all
tell
you
they
have
heard
of
the
great
french
fighter
as
they
call
the
wonderful
little
corsican
whether
this
knowledge
was
obtained
through
the
fact
that
our
earliest
settlers
and
pioneers
were
french
or
whether
almost
magical
fighting
career
attracted
the
indian
mind
to
the
exclusion
of
lesser
warriors
i
have
never
yet
decided
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
indians
of
our
generation
are
not
as
familiar
with
bonaparte
name
as
were
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
so
either
the
predominance
of
settlers
or
the
thinning
of
their
ancient
blood
by
modern
civilization
and
peaceful
times
must
one
or
the
other
account
for
the
younger
indian
ignorance
of
the
emperor
of
the
french
in
telling
me
the
legend
of
the
lost
talisman
my
good
tillicum
the
late
chief
capilano
began
the
story
with
the
almost
amazing
question
had
i
ever
heard
of
napoleon
bonaparte
it
was
some
moments
before
i
just
caught
the
name
for
his
english
always
quaint
and
beautiful
was
at
times
a
little
halting
but
when
he
said
by
way
of
explanation
you
know
big
fighter
frenchman
the
english
they
beat
him
in
big
battle
i
grasped
immediately
of
whom
he
spoke
what
do
you
know
of
him
i
asked
his
voice
lowered
almost
as
if
he
spoke
a
state
secret
i
know
how
it
is
that
english
they
beat
him
i
have
read
many
historians
on
this
event
but
to
hear
the
squamish
version
was
a
novel
and
absorbing
thing
yes
i
said
my
usual
leading
word
to
lure
him
into
channels
of
tradition
yes
he
affirmed
then
still
in
a
he
proceeded
to
tell
me
that
it
all
happened
through
the
agency
of
a
single
joint
from
the
vertebra
of
a
in
telling
me
the
story
of
brockton
point
and
the
valiant
boy
who
killed
the
monster
he
dwelt
lightly
on
the
fact
that
all
people
who
approach
the
vicinity
of
the
creature
are
palsied
both
mentally
and
physically
bewitched
in
fact
so
that
their
bones
become
disjointed
and
their
brains
incapable
but
he
elaborated
upon
this
peculiarity
until
i
harked
back
to
the
boy
of
brockton
point
and
asked
how
it
was
that
his
body
and
brain
escaped
this
affliction
he
was
all
good
and
had
no
greed
he
replied
he
was
proof
against
all
bad
things
i
nodded
understandingly
and
he
proceeded
to
tell
me
that
all
successful
indian
fighters
and
warriors
carried
somewhere
about
their
person
a
joint
of
a
vertebra
that
the
threw
the
power
about
them
so
that
they
were
not
personally
affected
by
this
little
charm
but
that
immediately
they
approached
an
enemy
the
charm
worked
disaster
and
victory
was
assured
to
the
fortunate
possessor
of
the
talisman
there
was
one
particularly
effective
joint
that
had
been
treasured
and
carried
by
the
warriors
of
a
great
squamish
family
for
a
century
these
warriors
had
conquered
every
foe
they
encountered
until
the
talisman
had
become
so
renowned
that
the
of
their
entire
clan
was
remodelled
and
the
new
one
crested
by
the
figure
of
a
single
joint
of
a
vertebra
about
this
time
stories
of
napoleon
first
great
achievements
drifted
across
the
seas
not
across
the
land
and
just
here
may
be
a
clue
to
buried
history
which
those
who
are
cleverer
at
research
than
i
can
puzzle
over
the
chief
was
most
emphatic
about
the
source
of
indian
knowledge
of
napoleon
i
suppose
you
heard
of
him
from
quebec
through
perhaps
some
of
the
french
priests
i
remarked
no
no
he
contradicted
hurriedly
not
from
east
we
hear
it
from
over
the
pacific
from
the
place
they
call
russia
but
who
conveyed
the
news
or
by
what
means
it
came
he
could
not
further
enlighten
me
but
a
strange
thing
happened
to
the
squamish
family
about
this
time
there
was
a
large
blood
connection
but
the
only
male
member
living
was
a
very
old
warrior
the
hero
of
many
battles
and
the
possessor
of
the
talisman
on
his
his
women
of
three
generations
gathered
about
him
his
wife
his
sisters
his
daughters
his
granddaughters
but
not
one
man
nor
yet
a
boy
of
his
own
blood
stood
by
to
speed
his
departing
warrior
spirit
to
the
land
of
peace
and
plenty
the
charm
can
not
rest
in
the
hands
of
women
he
murmured
almost
with
his
last
breath
women
may
not
war
and
fight
other
nations
or
other
tribes
women
are
for
the
peaceful
lodge
and
for
the
leading
of
little
children
they
are
for
holding
baby
hands
teaching
baby
feet
to
walk
no
the
charm
can
not
rest
with
you
women
i
have
no
brother
no
cousin
no
son
no
grandson
and
the
charm
must
not
go
to
a
lesser
warrior
than
i
none
of
our
tribe
nor
of
any
tribe
on
the
coast
ever
conquered
me
the
charm
must
go
to
one
as
unconquerable
as
i
have
been
when
i
am
dead
send
it
across
the
great
salt
chuck
to
the
victorious
they
call
him
napoleon
bonaparte
they
were
his
last
words
the
older
women
wished
to
bury
the
charm
with
him
but
the
younger
women
inspired
with
the
spirit
of
their
generation
were
determined
to
send
it
in
the
grave
it
will
be
dead
they
argued
let
it
still
live
on
let
it
help
some
other
fighter
to
greatness
and
victory
as
if
to
confirm
their
decision
the
next
day
a
small
anchored
in
the
inlet
all
the
men
aboard
spoke
russian
save
two
thin
dark
agile
sailors
who
kept
aloof
from
the
crew
and
conversed
in
another
language
these
two
came
ashore
with
part
of
the
crew
and
talked
in
french
with
a
wandering
hudson
bay
trapper
who
often
lodged
with
the
squamish
people
thus
the
women
who
yet
mourned
over
their
dead
warrior
knew
these
two
strangers
to
be
from
the
land
where
the
great
frenchman
was
fighting
against
the
world
here
i
interrupted
the
chief
how
came
the
frenchmen
in
a
russian
sealer
i
asked
captives
he
replied
almost
slaves
and
hated
by
their
captors
as
the
majority
always
hate
the
few
so
the
women
drew
those
two
frenchmen
apart
from
the
rest
and
told
them
the
story
of
the
bone
of
the
urging
them
to
carry
it
back
to
their
own
country
and
give
it
to
the
great
who
was
as
courageous
and
as
brave
as
their
dead
leader
the
frenchmen
hesitated
the
talisman
might
affect
them
they
said
might
jangle
their
own
brains
so
that
on
their
return
to
russia
they
would
not
have
the
sagacity
to
plan
an
escape
to
their
own
country
might
disjoint
their
bodies
so
that
their
feet
and
hands
would
be
useless
and
they
would
become
as
weak
as
children
but
the
women
assured
them
that
the
charm
only
worked
its
magical
powers
over
a
man
enemies
that
the
ancient
had
it
with
this
quality
so
the
frenchmen
took
it
and
promised
that
if
it
were
in
the
power
of
man
they
would
convey
it
to
emperor
as
the
crew
boarded
the
sealer
the
women
watching
from
the
shore
observed
strange
contortions
seize
many
of
the
men
some
fell
on
the
deck
some
crouched
shaking
as
with
palsy
some
writhed
for
a
moment
then
fell
limp
and
seemingly
boneless
only
the
two
frenchmen
stood
erect
and
strong
and
vital
the
squamish
talisman
had
already
overcome
their
foes
as
the
little
sealer
set
sail
up
the
gulf
she
was
commanded
by
a
crew
of
two
frenchmen
men
who
had
entered
these
waters
as
captives
who
were
leaving
them
as
conquerors
the
palsied
russians
were
worse
than
useless
and
what
became
of
them
the
chief
could
not
state
presumably
they
were
flung
overboard
and
by
some
trick
of
a
kindly
fate
the
frenchmen
at
last
reached
the
coast
of
france
tradition
is
so
indefinite
about
their
movements
subsequent
to
sailing
out
of
the
inlet
that
even
the
and
vividly
colored
imaginations
of
the
squamish
people
have
never
supplied
the
details
of
this
beautifully
childish
yet
strangely
historical
but
the
voices
of
the
trumpets
of
war
the
beat
of
drums
throughout
europe
heralded
back
to
the
wilds
of
the
pacific
coast
forests
the
intelligence
that
the
great
squamish
eventually
reached
the
person
of
napoleon
that
from
this
time
onward
his
career
was
one
vast
victory
that
he
won
battle
after
battle
conquered
nation
after
nation
and
but
for
the
direst
calamity
that
could
befall
a
warrior
would
eventually
have
been
master
of
the
world
what
was
this
calamity
chief
i
asked
amazed
at
his
knowledge
of
the
great
historical
soldier
and
strategist
the
chief
voice
again
lowered
to
a
whisper
his
face
was
almost
rigid
with
intentness
as
he
replied
he
lost
the
squamish
charm
lost
it
just
before
one
great
fight
with
the
english
people
i
looked
at
him
curiously
he
had
been
telling
me
the
oddest
mixture
of
history
and
superstition
of
intelligence
and
ignorance
the
most
whimsically
absurd
yet
impressive
tale
i
ever
heard
from
indian
lips
what
was
the
name
of
the
great
fight
did
you
ever
hear
it
i
asked
wondering
how
much
he
knew
of
events
which
took
place
at
the
other
side
of
the
world
a
century
agone
yes
he
said
carefully
thoughtfully
i
hear
the
name
sometime
in
london
when
i
there
railroad
station
there
same
name
was
it
waterloo
i
asked
he
nodded
quickly
without
a
shadow
of
hesitation
that
the
one
he
replied
that
it
waterloo
the
lure
in
stanley
park
there
is
a
trail
in
stanley
park
that
leads
to
what
i
always
love
to
call
the
cathedral
trees
that
group
of
some
forest
giants
that
arch
overhead
with
such
superb
loftiness
but
in
all
the
world
there
is
no
cathedral
whose
marble
or
onyx
columns
can
vie
with
those
straight
clean
brown
that
teem
with
the
sap
and
blood
of
life
there
is
no
fresco
that
can
rival
the
delicacy
of
they
have
festooned
between
you
and
the
far
skies
no
tiles
no
mosaic
or
inlaid
marbles
are
as
fascinating
as
the
bare
russet
fragrant
floor
outspreading
about
their
feet
they
are
the
acme
of
nature
architecture
and
in
building
them
she
has
outrivalled
all
her
erstwhile
conceptions
she
will
never
originate
a
more
faultless
design
never
erect
a
more
perfect
edifice
but
the
divinely
moulded
trees
and
the
cathedral
have
one
exquisite
characteristic
in
common
it
is
the
atmosphere
of
holiness
most
of
us
have
better
impulses
after
viewing
a
stately
cathedral
and
none
of
us
can
stand
amid
that
majestic
forest
group
without
experiencing
some
elevating
thoughts
some
refinement
of
our
coarser
nature
perhaps
those
who
read
this
little
legend
will
never
again
look
at
those
cathedral
trees
without
thinking
of
the
glorious
souls
they
contain
for
according
to
the
coast
indians
they
do
harbor
human
souls
and
the
world
is
better
because
they
once
had
the
speech
and
the
hearts
of
mighty
men
my
tillicum
did
not
use
the
word
lure
in
telling
me
this
legend
there
is
no
equivalent
for
the
word
in
the
chinook
tongue
but
the
gestures
of
his
voiceful
hands
so
expressed
the
quality
of
something
between
magnetism
and
charm
that
i
have
selected
this
word
lure
as
best
fitting
what
he
wished
to
convey
some
few
yards
beyond
the
cathedral
trees
an
overgrown
disused
trail
turns
into
the
dense
wilderness
to
the
right
only
indian
eyes
could
discern
that
trail
and
the
indians
do
not
willingly
go
to
that
part
of
the
park
to
the
right
of
the
great
group
nothing
in
this
nor
yet
the
next
world
would
tempt
a
coast
indian
into
the
compact
centres
of
the
wild
portions
of
the
park
for
therein
concealed
cunningly
is
the
lure
they
all
believe
in
there
is
not
a
tribe
in
the
entire
district
that
does
not
know
of
this
strange
legend
you
will
hear
the
tale
from
those
that
gather
at
eagle
harbor
for
the
fishing
from
the
fraser
river
tribes
from
the
squamish
at
the
narrows
from
the
mission
from
up
the
inlet
even
from
the
tribes
at
north
bend
but
no
one
will
volunteer
to
be
your
guide
for
having
once
come
within
the
aura
of
the
lure
it
is
a
human
impossibility
to
leave
it
your
is
dwarfed
your
intelligence
blighted
your
feet
will
refuse
to
lead
you
out
by
a
straight
trail
you
will
circle
circle
for
evermore
about
this
magnet
for
if
death
kindly
comes
to
your
aid
your
immortal
spirit
will
go
on
in
that
endless
circling
that
will
bar
it
from
entering
the
happy
hunting
grounds
and
like
the
cathedral
trees
the
lure
once
lived
a
human
soul
but
in
this
instance
it
was
a
soul
depraved
not
sanctified
the
indian
belief
is
very
beautiful
concerning
the
results
of
good
and
evil
in
the
human
body
the
sagalie
tyee
god
has
his
own
way
of
immortalizing
each
people
who
are
wilfully
evil
who
have
no
kindness
in
their
hearts
who
are
bloodthirsty
cruel
vengeful
unsympathetic
the
sagalie
tyee
turns
to
solid
stone
that
will
harbor
no
growth
even
that
of
moss
or
lichen
for
these
stones
contain
no
moisture
just
as
their
wicked
hearts
lacked
the
milk
of
human
kindness
the
one
famed
exception
wherein
a
good
man
was
transformed
into
stone
was
in
the
instance
of
siwash
rock
but
as
the
indian
tells
you
of
it
he
smiles
with
gratification
as
he
calls
your
attention
to
the
tiny
tree
cresting
that
imperial
monument
he
says
the
tree
was
always
there
to
show
the
nations
that
the
good
in
this
man
heart
kept
on
growing
even
when
his
body
had
ceased
to
be
on
the
other
hand
the
sagalie
tyee
transforms
the
kindly
people
the
humane
sympathetic
charitable
loving
people
into
trees
so
that
after
death
they
may
go
on
forever
benefiting
all
mankind
they
may
yield
fruit
give
shade
and
shelter
afford
unending
service
to
the
living
by
their
usefulness
as
building
material
and
as
firewood
their
saps
and
gums
their
fibres
their
leaves
their
blossoms
enrich
nourish
and
sustain
the
human
form
no
evil
is
produced
by
trees
all
all
is
goodness
is
hearty
is
helpfulness
and
growth
they
give
refuge
to
the
birds
they
give
music
to
the
winds
and
from
them
are
carved
the
bows
and
arrows
the
canoes
and
paddles
bowls
spoons
and
baskets
their
service
to
mankind
is
priceless
the
indian
that
tells
you
this
tale
will
enumerate
all
these
attributes
and
virtues
of
the
trees
no
wonder
the
sagalie
tyee
chose
them
to
be
the
abode
of
souls
good
and
great
but
the
lure
in
stanley
park
is
that
most
dreaded
of
all
things
an
evil
soul
it
is
embodied
in
a
bare
white
stone
which
is
shunned
by
moss
and
vine
and
lichen
but
over
which
are
splashed
innumerable
spots
that
have
eaten
into
the
surface
like
an
acid
this
condemned
soul
once
animated
the
body
of
a
who
went
up
and
down
the
coast
over
seas
and
far
inland
casting
her
evil
eye
on
innocent
people
and
bringing
them
untold
evils
and
diseases
about
her
person
she
carried
the
renowned
bad
medicine
that
every
indian
believes
in
medicine
that
weakened
the
arm
of
the
warrior
in
battle
that
caused
deformities
that
poisoned
minds
and
characters
that
engendered
madness
that
bred
plagues
and
epidemics
in
short
that
was
the
seed
of
every
evil
that
could
befall
mankind
this
herself
was
immune
from
death
generations
were
born
and
grew
to
old
age
and
died
and
other
generations
arose
in
their
stead
but
the
went
about
her
heart
set
against
her
kind
her
acts
were
evil
her
purposes
wicked
she
broke
hearts
and
bodies
and
souls
she
gloried
in
tears
and
revelled
in
unhappiness
and
sent
them
broadcast
wherever
she
wandered
and
in
his
high
heaven
the
sagalie
tyee
wept
with
sorrow
for
his
afflicted
human
children
he
dared
not
let
her
die
for
her
spirit
would
still
go
on
with
its
evil
doing
in
mighty
anger
he
gave
command
to
his
four
men
always
representing
the
deity
that
they
should
turn
this
into
a
stone
and
enchain
her
spirit
in
its
centre
that
the
curse
of
her
might
be
lifted
from
the
unhappy
race
so
the
four
men
entered
their
giant
canoe
and
headed
as
was
their
custom
up
the
narrows
as
they
neared
what
is
now
known
as
prospect
point
they
heard
from
the
heights
above
them
a
laugh
and
looking
up
they
beheld
the
jeering
defiantly
at
them
they
landed
and
scaling
the
rocks
pursued
her
as
she
danced
away
eluding
them
like
a
as
she
called
out
to
them
sneeringly
care
for
yourselves
oh
men
of
the
sagalie
tyee
or
i
shall
blight
you
with
my
evil
eye
care
for
yourselves
and
do
not
follow
me
on
and
on
she
danced
through
the
thickest
of
the
wilderness
on
and
on
they
followed
until
they
reached
the
very
heart
of
the
neck
of
land
we
know
as
stanley
park
then
the
tallest
the
mightiest
of
the
four
men
lifted
his
hand
and
cried
out
oh
woman
of
the
stony
heart
be
stone
for
evermore
and
bear
forever
a
black
stain
for
each
one
of
your
evil
deeds
and
as
he
spoke
the
was
transformed
into
this
stone
that
tradition
says
is
in
the
centre
of
the
park
such
is
the
legend
of
the
lure
whether
or
not
this
stone
is
really
in
existence
who
knows
one
thing
is
positive
however
no
indian
will
ever
help
to
discover
it
three
different
indians
have
told
me
that
fifteen
or
eighteen
years
ago
two
tourists
a
man
and
a
woman
were
lost
in
stanley
park
when
found
a
week
later
the
man
was
dead
the
woman
mad
and
each
of
my
informants
firmly
believed
they
had
in
their
wanderings
encountered
the
stone
and
were
compelled
to
circle
around
it
because
of
its
powerful
lure
but
this
wild
tale
fortunately
had
a
most
beautiful
conclusion
the
four
men
fearing
that
the
evil
heart
imprisoned
in
the
stone
would
still
work
destruction
said
at
the
end
of
the
trail
we
must
place
so
good
and
great
a
thing
that
it
will
be
mightier
stronger
more
powerful
than
this
evil
so
they
chose
from
the
nations
the
kindliest
most
benevolent
men
men
whose
hearts
were
filled
with
the
love
of
their
and
transformed
these
merciful
souls
into
the
stately
group
of
cathedral
trees
how
well
the
purpose
of
the
sagalie
tyee
has
wrought
its
effect
through
time
the
good
has
predominated
as
he
planned
it
to
for
is
not
the
stone
hidden
in
some
unknown
part
of
the
park
where
eyes
do
not
see
it
and
feet
do
not
follow
and
do
not
the
thousands
who
come
to
us
from
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
world
seek
that
wondrous
beauty
spot
and
stand
awed
by
the
majestic
silence
the
almost
holiness
of
that
group
of
giants
more
than
any
other
legend
that
the
indians
about
vancouver
have
told
me
does
this
tale
reveal
the
love
of
the
coast
native
for
kindness
and
his
hatred
of
cruelty
if
these
tribes
really
have
ever
been
a
warlike
race
i
can
not
think
they
pride
themselves
much
on
the
occupation
if
you
talk
with
any
of
them
and
they
mention
some
man
they
particularly
like
or
admire
their
first
qualification
of
him
is
he
a
kind
man
they
never
say
he
is
brave
or
rich
or
successful
or
even
strong
that
characteristic
so
loved
by
the
red
man
to
these
coast
tribes
if
a
man
is
kind
he
is
everything
and
almost
without
exception
their
legends
deal
with
rewards
for
tenderness
and
and
personal
and
mental
cleanliness
call
them
if
you
wish
to
they
all
have
a
reasonableness
that
must
have
originated
in
some
mighty
mind
and
better
than
that
they
all
tell
of
the
indian
faith
in
the
survival
of
the
best
impulses
of
the
human
heart
and
the
ultimate
extinction
of
the
worst
in
talking
with
my
many
good
tillicums
i
find
this
legend
is
the
most
universally
known
and
thoroughly
believed
in
of
all
traditions
they
have
honored
me
by
revealing
to
me
deer
lake
few
white
men
ventured
inland
a
century
ago
in
the
days
of
the
first
chief
capilano
when
the
spoils
of
the
mighty
fraser
river
poured
into
hands
but
did
not
find
their
way
to
the
remotest
corners
of
the
earth
as
in
our
times
when
the
gold
from
its
sources
the
salmon
from
its
mouth
the
timber
from
its
shores
are
riches
the
fisherman
craft
the
hunter
cunning
were
plied
where
now
cities
and
industries
trade
and
commerce
buying
and
selling
hold
sway
in
those
days
the
moccasined
foot
awoke
no
echo
in
the
forest
trails
primitive
weapons
arms
implements
and
utensils
were
the
only
means
of
the
indians
his
livelihood
depended
upon
his
own
personal
prowess
his
skill
in
woodcraft
and
water
lore
and
as
this
is
a
story
of
an
spear
the
reader
must
first
be
in
sympathy
with
the
fact
that
this
rude
instrument
most
deftly
fashioned
was
of
priceless
value
to
the
first
capilano
to
whom
it
had
come
through
three
generations
of
ancestors
all
of
whom
had
been
experienced
hunters
and
dexterous
fishermen
capilano
himself
was
without
a
rival
as
a
spearman
he
knew
the
moods
of
the
fraser
river
the
habits
of
its
thronging
tenants
as
no
other
man
has
ever
known
them
before
or
since
he
knew
every
isle
and
inlet
along
the
coast
every
boulder
the
the
still
pools
the
temper
of
the
tides
he
knew
the
the
secret
streams
that
fed
the
larger
rivers
the
outlets
of
lakes
the
turns
and
tricks
of
swirling
rapids
he
knew
the
haunts
of
bird
and
beast
and
fish
and
fowl
and
was
master
of
the
arts
and
artifice
that
man
must
use
when
matching
his
brain
against
the
eluding
wiles
of
the
untamed
creatures
of
the
wilderness
once
only
did
his
cunning
fail
him
once
only
did
nature
baffle
him
with
her
mysterious
fabric
of
waterways
and
it
was
when
he
was
led
to
the
mouth
of
the
unknown
river
which
has
evaded
discovery
through
all
the
centuries
but
which
so
say
the
indians
still
sings
on
its
way
through
some
buried
channel
that
leads
from
the
lake
to
the
sea
he
had
been
sealing
along
the
shores
of
what
is
now
known
as
point
grey
his
canoe
had
gradually
crept
inland
skirting
up
the
coast
to
the
mouth
of
false
creek
here
he
encountered
a
very
king
of
seals
a
colossal
creature
that
gladdened
the
hunter
eyes
as
game
worthy
of
his
skill
for
this
particular
prize
he
would
cast
the
spear
it
had
never
failed
his
sire
his
grandsire
his
he
knew
it
would
not
fail
him
now
a
long
pliable
rope
lay
in
his
canoe
many
expert
fingers
had
woven
and
plaited
the
rope
had
beaten
and
oiled
it
until
it
was
soft
and
flexible
as
a
serpent
this
he
attached
to
the
spearhead
and
with
deft
unerring
aim
cast
it
at
the
king
seal
the
weapon
struck
home
the
gigantic
creature
shuddered
and
with
a
cry
like
a
hurt
child
it
plunged
down
into
the
sea
with
the
rapidity
and
strength
of
a
giant
fish
it
scudded
inland
with
the
rising
tide
while
capilano
paid
out
the
rope
its
entire
length
and
as
it
stretched
taut
felt
the
canoe
leap
forward
propelled
by
the
mighty
strength
of
the
creature
which
lashed
the
waters
into
whirlpools
as
though
it
was
possessed
with
the
power
and
properties
of
a
whale
up
the
stretch
of
false
creek
the
man
and
monster
drove
their
course
where
a
century
hence
great
city
bridges
were
to
the
waters
they
strove
and
struggled
each
for
the
mastery
neither
of
them
weakened
neither
of
them
faltered
the
one
dragging
the
other
driving
in
the
end
it
was
to
be
a
matching
of
brute
and
human
wits
not
forces
as
they
neared
the
point
where
now
main
street
bridge
flings
its
shadow
across
the
waters
the
brute
leaped
high
into
the
air
then
plunged
headlong
into
the
depths
the
impact
ripped
the
rope
from
capilano
hands
it
rattled
across
the
gunwale
he
stood
staring
at
the
spot
where
it
had
disappeared
the
brute
had
been
victorious
at
low
tide
the
indian
made
search
no
trace
of
his
game
of
his
precious
spear
of
his
rope
could
be
found
with
the
loss
of
the
latter
he
firmly
believed
his
luck
as
a
hunter
would
be
gone
so
he
patrolled
the
mouth
of
false
creek
for
many
moons
his
graceful
canoe
rarely
touched
other
waters
but
the
seal
king
had
disappeared
often
he
thought
long
strands
of
drifting
sea
grasses
were
his
lost
rope
with
other
spears
with
other
with
and
cunning
traps
he
dislodged
the
weeds
from
their
moorings
but
they
slipped
their
slimy
lengths
through
his
eager
hands
his
best
spear
with
its
attendant
coil
was
gone
the
following
year
he
was
sealing
again
off
the
coast
of
point
grey
and
one
night
after
sunset
he
observed
the
red
reflection
from
the
west
which
seemed
to
transfer
itself
to
the
eastern
skies
far
into
the
night
dashes
of
flaming
scarlet
pulsed
far
beyond
the
head
of
false
creek
the
color
rose
and
fell
like
a
beckoning
hand
and
he
immediately
attached
some
portentous
meaning
to
the
unusual
sight
that
it
was
some
omen
he
never
doubted
so
he
paddled
inland
beached
his
canoe
and
took
the
trail
towards
the
little
group
of
lakes
that
crowd
themselves
into
the
area
that
lies
between
the
present
cities
of
vancouver
and
new
westminster
but
long
before
he
reached
the
shores
of
deer
lake
he
discovered
that
the
beckoning
hand
was
in
reality
flame
the
little
body
of
water
was
surrounded
by
forest
fires
one
avenue
alone
stood
open
it
was
a
group
of
giant
trees
that
as
yet
the
flames
had
not
reached
as
he
neared
the
point
he
saw
a
great
moving
mass
of
living
things
leaving
the
lake
and
hurrying
northward
through
this
one
egress
he
stood
listening
intently
watching
with
alert
eyes
the
zwirr
of
myriads
of
little
travelling
feet
caught
his
quick
ear
the
moving
mass
was
an
immense
colony
of
beaver
thousands
upon
thousands
of
them
scores
of
baby
beavers
staggered
along
following
their
mothers
scores
of
older
beavers
that
had
felled
trees
and
built
dams
through
many
seasons
a
countless
army
of
trekking
all
under
the
generalship
of
a
wise
old
leader
who
as
king
of
the
colony
advanced
some
few
yards
ahead
of
his
battalions
out
of
the
waters
through
the
forest
towards
the
country
to
the
north
they
journeyed
wandering
hunters
said
they
saw
them
cross
burrard
inlet
at
the
second
narrows
heading
inland
as
they
reached
the
farther
shore
but
where
that
mighty
army
of
royal
little
canadians
set
up
their
new
colony
no
man
knows
not
even
the
astuteness
of
the
first
capilano
ever
discovered
their
destination
only
one
thing
was
certain
deer
lake
knew
them
no
more
after
their
passing
the
indian
retraced
their
trail
to
the
edge
in
the
red
glare
of
the
encircling
fires
he
saw
what
he
at
first
thought
was
some
dead
and
dethroned
king
beaver
on
the
shore
a
huge
carcass
lay
half
in
half
out
of
the
lake
approaching
it
he
saw
the
wasted
body
of
a
giant
seal
there
could
never
be
two
seals
of
that
marvellous
size
his
intuition
now
grasped
the
meaning
of
the
omen
of
the
beckoning
flame
that
had
called
him
from
the
far
coasts
of
point
grey
he
stooped
above
his
dead
conqueror
and
found
embedded
in
its
decaying
flesh
the
spear
of
his
forefathers
and
trailing
away
at
the
water
rim
was
a
long
flexible
rope
as
he
extracted
this
treasured
heirloom
he
felt
the
power
that
men
of
magic
possess
creep
up
his
sinewy
arms
it
entered
his
heart
his
blood
his
brain
for
a
long
time
he
sat
and
chanted
songs
that
only
great
may
sing
and
as
the
hours
drifted
by
the
heat
of
the
forest
fires
subsided
the
flames
diminished
into
smouldering
blackness
at
daybreak
the
forest
fire
was
dead
but
its
beckoning
fingers
had
served
their
purpose
the
magic
spear
had
come
back
to
its
own
until
the
day
of
his
death
the
first
capilano
searched
for
the
unknown
river
up
which
the
seal
travelled
from
false
creek
to
deer
lake
but
its
channel
is
a
secret
that
even
indian
eyes
have
not
seen
but
although
those
of
the
squamish
tribe
tell
and
believe
that
the
river
still
sings
through
its
hidden
trail
that
leads
from
deer
lake
to
the
sea
its
course
is
as
unknown
its
channel
is
as
hopelessly
lost
as
the
brave
little
army
of
beavers
that
a
century
ago
marshalled
their
forces
and
travelled
up
into
the
great
lone
north
a
royal
mohawk
chief
how
many
canadians
are
aware
that
in
prince
arthur
duke
of
connaught
and
only
surviving
son
of
queen
victoria
who
has
been
appointed
to
represent
king
george
in
canada
they
undoubtedly
have
what
many
wish
for
one
bearing
an
ancient
canadian
title
as
of
all
the
dominion
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
man
more
canadian
than
any
one
of
the
fifty
chiefs
who
compose
the
parliament
of
the
ancient
iroquois
nation
that
loyal
race
of
redskins
that
has
fought
for
the
british
crown
against
all
of
the
enemies
thereof
adhering
to
the
british
flag
through
the
wars
against
both
the
french
and
the
colonists
arthur
duke
of
connaught
is
the
only
living
white
man
who
has
an
undisputed
right
to
the
title
of
chief
of
the
six
nations
indians
known
collectively
as
the
iroquois
he
possesses
the
privilege
of
sitting
in
their
councils
of
casting
his
vote
on
all
matters
relative
to
the
governing
of
the
tribes
the
disposal
of
reservation
lands
the
appropriation
of
both
the
principal
and
interest
of
the
more
than
half
a
million
dollars
these
tribes
hold
in
government
bonds
at
ottawa
accumulated
from
the
sales
of
their
lands
in
short
were
every
drop
of
blood
in
his
royal
veins
red
instead
of
blue
he
could
not
be
more
fully
qualified
as
an
indian
chief
than
he
now
is
not
even
were
his
title
one
of
the
fifty
hereditary
ones
whose
illustrious
names
composed
the
iroquois
confederacy
before
the
paleface
ever
set
foot
in
america
it
was
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
visit
to
canada
in
when
he
was
little
more
than
a
boy
that
prince
arthur
received
upon
his
arrival
at
quebec
an
address
of
welcome
from
his
royal
indian
children
on
the
grand
river
reserve
in
brant
county
ontario
in
addition
to
this
welcome
they
had
a
request
to
make
of
him
would
he
accept
the
title
of
chief
and
visit
their
reserve
to
give
them
the
opportunity
of
conferring
one
of
the
great
secrets
of
england
success
with
savage
races
has
been
her
consideration
her
respect
her
almost
reverence
of
native
customs
ceremonies
and
potentates
she
wishes
her
own
customs
and
kings
to
be
honored
so
she
freely
accords
like
honor
to
her
subjects
it
matters
not
whether
they
be
white
black
or
red
young
arthur
was
delighted
royal
lads
are
pretty
much
like
all
other
boys
the
unique
ceremony
would
be
a
break
in
the
endless
round
of
state
receptions
banquets
and
addresses
so
he
accepted
the
red
indians
compliment
knowing
well
that
it
was
the
loftiest
honor
these
people
could
confer
upon
a
white
man
it
was
the
morning
of
october
first
when
the
royal
train
steamed
into
the
little
city
of
brantford
where
carriages
awaited
to
take
the
prince
and
his
suite
to
the
old
mohawk
church
in
the
vicinity
of
which
the
ceremony
was
to
take
place
as
the
especial
escort
onwanonsyshon
head
chief
of
the
mohawks
rode
on
a
pony
beside
the
carriage
the
chief
was
garmented
in
full
native
costume
a
buckskin
suit
beaded
moccasins
headband
of
and
eagle
feathers
and
ornaments
hammered
from
coin
silver
that
literally
covered
his
coat
and
leggings
about
his
shoulders
was
flung
a
scarlet
blanket
consisting
of
the
identical
broadcloth
from
which
the
british
army
tunics
are
made
this
he
hunched
with
his
shoulders
from
time
to
time
in
true
indian
fashion
as
they
drove
along
the
prince
chatted
boyishly
with
his
mohawk
escort
and
once
leaned
forward
to
pat
the
black
pony
on
its
shining
neck
and
speak
admiringly
of
it
it
was
a
warm
autumn
day
the
roads
were
dry
and
dusty
and
after
a
mile
or
so
the
brought
from
beneath
the
carriage
seat
a
basket
of
grapes
with
his
handkerchief
he
flicked
the
dust
from
them
handed
a
bunch
to
the
chief
and
took
one
himself
an
odd
spectacle
to
be
traversing
a
country
road
an
english
prince
and
an
indian
chief
riding
amicably
side
by
side
enjoying
a
banquet
of
grapes
like
two
on
reaching
the
church
arthur
leapt
lightly
to
the
greensward
for
a
moment
he
stood
rigid
gazing
before
him
at
his
future
his
escort
had
given
him
a
faint
idea
of
what
he
was
to
see
but
he
certainly
never
expected
to
be
completely
surrounded
by
three
hundred
iroquois
braves
and
warriors
such
as
now
encircled
him
on
every
side
every
indian
was
in
and
feathers
some
stripped
to
the
waist
their
skins
brilliant
with
paints
dyes
and
patterns
all
carried
tomahawks
and
bows
and
arrows
every
red
throat
gave
a
tremendous
as
he
alighted
which
was
repeated
again
and
again
as
for
that
half
moment
he
stood
silent
a
slim
boyish
figure
clad
in
light
grey
tweeds
a
singular
contrast
to
the
stalwarts
in
gorgeous
costumes
who
crowded
about
him
his
young
face
paled
to
ashy
whiteness
then
with
true
british
grit
he
extended
his
right
hand
and
raised
his
black
hat
with
his
left
at
the
same
time
he
took
one
step
forward
then
the
broke
forth
anew
deafening
savage
terrible
cries
as
one
by
one
the
entire
three
hundred
filed
past
the
prince
shaking
hands
with
each
one
and
removing
his
glove
to
do
so
this
strange
reception
over
onwanonsyshon
rode
up
and
flinging
his
scarlet
blanket
on
the
grass
dismounted
and
asked
the
prince
to
stand
on
it
then
stepped
forward
an
ancient
chief
father
of
onwanonsyshon
and
speaker
of
the
council
he
was
old
in
inherited
and
personal
loyalty
to
the
british
crown
he
had
fought
under
sir
isaac
brock
at
queenston
heights
in
while
yet
a
mere
boy
and
upon
him
was
laid
the
honor
of
making
his
queen
son
a
chief
taking
arthur
by
the
hand
this
venerable
warrior
walked
slowly
to
and
fro
across
the
blanket
chanting
as
he
went
the
strange
wild
formula
of
induction
from
time
to
time
he
was
interrupted
by
loud
expressions
of
approval
and
assent
from
the
vast
throng
of
encircling
braves
but
apart
from
this
no
sound
was
heard
but
the
low
weird
monotone
of
a
ritual
older
than
the
white
man
in
north
america
it
is
necessary
that
a
chief
of
each
of
the
three
clans
of
the
mohawks
shall
assist
in
this
ceremony
the
veteran
chief
who
sang
the
formula
was
of
the
bear
clan
his
son
onwanonsyshon
was
of
the
wolf
the
clanship
descends
through
the
mother
side
of
the
family
then
one
other
chief
of
the
turtle
clan
and
in
whose
veins
coursed
the
blood
of
the
historic
brant
now
stepped
to
the
edge
of
the
scarlet
blanket
the
chant
ended
these
two
young
chiefs
received
the
prince
into
the
mohawk
tribe
conferring
upon
him
the
name
of
kavakoudge
which
means
the
sun
flying
from
east
to
west
under
the
guidance
of
the
great
spirit
onwanonsyshon
then
took
from
his
waist
a
brilliant
sash
heavily
embroidered
with
beads
porcupine
quills
and
dyed
placing
it
over
the
prince
left
shoulder
and
knotting
it
beneath
his
right
arm
the
ceremony
was
ended
the
constitution
that
hiawatha
had
founded
centuries
ago
a
constitution
wherein
fifty
chiefs
no
more
no
less
should
form
the
parliament
of
the
six
nations
had
been
shattered
and
broken
because
this
race
of
loyal
red
men
desired
to
do
honor
to
a
slender
young
who
now
bears
the
title
of
the
iroquois
many
white
men
have
received
from
these
same
people
honorary
titles
but
none
has
been
bestowed
through
the
ancient
ritual
with
the
imperative
members
of
the
three
clans
assisting
save
that
borne
by
arthur
of
connaught
after
the
ceremony
the
prince
entered
the
church
to
autograph
his
name
in
the
ancient
bible
which
with
a
silver
holy
communion
service
a
bell
two
tablets
inscribed
with
the
ten
commandments
and
a
bronze
british
coat
of
arms
had
been
presented
to
the
mohawks
by
queen
anne
he
inscribed
arthur
just
below
the
albert
edward
which
as
prince
of
wales
the
late
king
wrote
when
he
visited
canada
in
when
he
returned
to
england
chief
kavakoudge
sent
his
portrait
together
with
one
of
queen
victoria
and
the
prince
consort
to
be
placed
in
the
council
house
of
the
six
nations
where
they
decorate
the
walls
as
i
write
i
glance
up
to
see
in
a
corner
of
my
room
a
draping
scarlet
blanket
made
of
british
army
broadcloth
for
the
chief
who
rode
the
pony
so
long
ago
was
the
writer
father
he
was
not
here
to
wear
it
when
arthur
of
connaught
again
set
foot
on
canadian
shores
many
of
these
facts
i
have
culled
from
a
paper
that
lies
on
my
desk
it
is
yellowing
with
age
and
bears
the
date
toronto
october
and
on
the
margin
is
written
in
a
clear
hand
onwanonsyshon
with
kind
regards
from
your
