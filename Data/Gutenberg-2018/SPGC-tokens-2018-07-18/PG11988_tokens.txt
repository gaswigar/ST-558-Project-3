as
a
boy
he
constructed
so
vividly
in
imagination
that
he
came
to
believe
in
the
living
reality
of
his
creations
for
everybody
and
everything
he
found
names
real
names
inside
him
somewhere
stretched
immense
playgrounds
compared
to
which
the
and
lawns
of
his
estate
seemed
trivial
plains
without
horizon
seas
deep
enough
to
float
the
planets
like
corks
and
such
tremendous
forests
with
trees
like
tall
pointed
hilltops
he
had
only
to
close
his
eyes
drop
his
thoughts
inwards
sink
after
them
himself
call
aloud
and
see
his
imagination
conceived
and
bore
worlds
but
nothing
in
these
worlds
became
alive
until
he
discovered
its
true
and
living
name
the
name
was
the
breath
of
life
and
sooner
or
later
he
invariably
found
it
once
having
terrified
his
sister
by
affirming
that
a
little
man
he
had
created
would
come
through
her
window
at
night
and
weave
a
peaked
cap
for
himself
by
pulling
out
all
her
hairs
that
had
gone
to
sleep
with
the
rest
of
her
body
he
took
characteristic
measures
to
protect
her
from
the
said
depredations
he
sat
up
the
entire
night
on
the
lawn
beneath
her
window
to
watch
believing
firmly
that
what
his
imagination
had
made
alive
would
come
to
pass
she
did
not
know
this
on
the
contrary
he
told
her
that
the
little
man
had
died
suddenly
only
he
sat
up
to
make
sure
and
for
a
boy
of
eight
those
cold
and
haunted
hours
must
have
seemed
endless
from
ten
to
four
in
the
morning
when
he
crept
back
to
his
own
corner
of
the
night
nursery
he
possessed
you
see
courage
as
well
as
faith
and
imagination
yet
the
name
of
the
little
man
was
nothing
more
formidable
than
winky
you
might
have
known
he
would
hurt
you
teresa
he
said
any
one
with
that
name
would
be
light
as
a
fly
and
gentle
a
regular
dicky
sort
of
chap
but
he
have
pincers
she
protested
or
he
could
pull
the
hairs
out
like
an
earwig
he
be
ugh
not
winky
never
he
explained
scornfully
jealous
of
his
reputation
he
do
it
with
his
rummy
little
fingers
then
his
fingers
would
have
claws
at
the
ends
she
insisted
for
no
amount
of
explanation
could
persuade
her
that
a
person
named
winky
could
be
nice
and
gentle
even
though
he
were
quicker
than
a
second
she
added
that
his
death
rejoiced
her
but
i
can
easily
make
another
such
a
nippy
little
beggar
and
twice
as
hoppy
as
the
first
only
i
wo
do
it
he
added
magnanimously
because
it
frightens
you
for
to
name
with
him
was
to
create
he
had
only
to
run
out
some
distance
into
his
big
mental
prairie
call
aloud
a
name
in
a
certain
commanding
way
and
instantly
its
owner
would
run
up
to
claim
it
names
described
souls
to
learn
the
name
of
a
thing
or
person
was
to
know
all
about
them
and
make
them
subservient
to
his
will
and
winky
could
only
have
been
a
very
soft
and
furry
little
person
swift
as
a
shadow
nimble
as
a
mouse
just
the
sort
of
fellow
who
make
a
conical
cap
out
of
a
girl
fluffy
hair
and
love
the
mischief
of
doing
it
and
so
with
all
things
names
were
vital
and
important
to
address
beings
by
their
intimate
first
names
beings
of
the
opposite
sex
especially
was
a
miniature
sacrament
and
the
story
of
that
premature
audacity
of
elsa
with
lohengrin
never
failed
to
touch
his
sense
of
awe
what
in
a
name
for
him
was
a
significant
question
a
question
of
life
or
death
for
to
mispronounce
a
name
was
a
bad
blunder
but
to
name
it
wrongly
was
to
miss
it
altogether
such
a
thing
had
no
real
life
or
at
best
a
vitality
that
would
soon
fade
adam
knew
that
and
he
pondered
much
in
his
childhood
over
the
difficulty
adam
must
have
had
discovering
the
correct
appellations
for
some
of
the
queerer
animals
as
he
grew
older
of
course
all
this
faded
a
good
deal
but
he
never
quite
lost
the
sense
of
reality
in
names
the
significance
of
a
true
name
the
absurdity
of
a
false
one
the
cruelty
of
mispronunciation
one
day
in
the
far
future
he
knew
some
wonderful
girl
would
come
into
his
life
singing
her
own
true
name
like
music
her
whole
personality
expressing
it
just
as
her
lips
framed
the
consonants
and
vowels
and
he
would
love
her
his
own
name
ridiculous
and
hateful
though
it
was
would
sing
in
reply
they
would
be
in
harmony
together
in
the
literal
sense
as
necessary
to
one
another
as
two
notes
in
the
same
chord
so
he
also
possessed
the
mystical
vision
of
the
poet
what
he
lacked
such
temperaments
always
do
was
the
sense
of
proportion
and
the
careful
balance
that
adjusts
cause
and
effect
and
this
it
is
no
doubt
that
makes
his
adventures
such
hard
sayings
it
becomes
difficult
to
disentangle
what
actually
did
happen
from
what
conceivably
might
have
happened
what
he
thinks
he
saw
from
what
positively
his
early
life
to
the
disgust
of
his
father
a
poor
country
squire
was
a
distressing
failure
he
missed
all
examinations
muddled
all
chances
and
finally
with
a
year
of
his
own
and
no
one
to
care
much
what
happened
to
him
settled
in
london
and
took
any
odd
job
of
a
secretarial
nature
that
offered
itself
he
kept
to
nothing
for
long
being
easily
dissatisfied
and
ever
on
the
look
out
for
the
job
that
might
conceal
the
kind
of
adventure
he
wanted
once
the
work
of
the
moment
proved
barren
of
this
possibility
he
wearied
of
it
and
sought
another
and
the
search
seemed
prolonged
and
hopeless
for
the
adventure
he
sought
was
not
a
common
kind
but
something
that
should
provide
him
with
a
means
of
escape
from
a
vulgar
and
noisy
world
that
bored
him
very
much
indeed
he
sought
an
adventure
that
should
announce
to
him
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
something
that
should
confirm
if
not
actually
replace
that
inner
region
of
wonder
and
delight
he
reveled
in
as
a
boy
but
which
education
and
conflict
with
a
prosaic
age
had
swept
away
from
his
nearer
consciousness
he
sought
that
is
an
authoritative
adventure
of
the
soul
to
look
at
one
could
have
believed
that
until
the
age
of
he
had
been
nameless
and
that
a
committee
had
then
sat
upon
the
subject
and
selected
the
sound
best
suited
to
describe
him
spinrobin
robert
for
had
he
never
seen
himself
but
run
into
that
inner
prairie
of
his
and
called
aloud
robert
spinrobin
an
individual
exactly
resembling
him
would
surely
have
pattered
up
to
claim
the
name
he
was
slight
graceful
quick
on
his
feet
and
generally
alert
took
little
steps
that
were
almost
hopping
and
when
he
was
in
a
hurry
gave
him
the
appearance
of
spinning
down
the
pavement
or
up
the
stairs
always
wore
clothes
of
some
fluffy
material
with
a
low
collar
and
bright
red
tie
had
soft
pink
cheeks
dancing
grey
eyes
and
loosely
scattered
hair
prematurely
thin
and
unquestionably
like
feathers
his
hands
and
feet
were
small
and
nimble
when
he
stood
in
his
favorite
attitude
with
hands
plunged
deep
in
his
pockets
slightly
spread
and
flapping
head
on
one
side
and
hair
disordered
talking
in
that
high
twittering
yet
very
agreeable
voice
of
his
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
the
conclusion
that
here
was
well
spinrobin
bobby
spinrobin
on
the
job
for
he
took
on
any
job
that
promised
adventure
of
the
kind
he
sought
and
the
queerer
the
better
as
soon
as
he
found
that
his
present
occupation
led
to
nothing
he
looked
about
for
something
new
chiefly
in
the
newspaper
advertisements
numbers
of
strange
people
advertised
in
the
newspapers
he
knew
just
as
numbers
of
strange
people
wrote
letters
to
them
and
spinny
so
he
was
called
by
those
who
loved
him
was
a
diligent
student
of
the
columns
known
as
agony
and
help
wanted
whereupon
it
came
about
that
he
was
aged
and
out
of
a
job
when
the
threads
of
the
following
occurrence
wove
into
the
pattern
of
his
life
and
led
to
something
of
a
kind
that
may
well
be
cause
for
question
and
amazement
the
advertisement
that
formed
the
bait
read
as
follows
wanted
by
retired
clergyman
secretarial
assistant
with
courage
and
imagination
tenor
voice
and
some
knowledge
of
hebrew
essential
single
apply
philip
skale
and
the
address
spinrobin
swallowed
the
bait
whole
unworldly
put
the
match
and
he
flamed
up
he
possessed
it
seemed
the
other
necessary
qualifications
for
a
thin
tenor
voice
not
unmusical
was
his
and
also
a
smattering
of
hebrew
which
he
had
picked
up
at
cambridge
because
he
liked
the
fine
names
of
deities
and
angels
to
be
found
in
that
language
courage
and
imagination
he
lumped
in
so
to
speak
with
the
rest
and
in
the
diary
he
affected
he
wrote
have
taken
on
skale
odd
advertisement
i
like
the
man
name
the
experience
may
prove
an
adventure
while
there
change
there
hope
for
he
was
very
fond
of
turning
proverbs
to
his
own
use
by
altering
them
and
the
said
diary
was
packed
with
absurd
misquotations
of
a
similar
kind
ii
a
singular
correspondence
followed
in
which
the
advertiser
explained
with
reserve
that
he
wanted
an
assistant
to
aid
him
in
certain
experiments
in
sound
that
a
particular
pitch
and
quality
of
voice
was
necessary
which
he
could
not
decide
until
of
course
he
had
heard
it
and
that
the
successful
applicant
must
have
sufficient
courage
and
imagination
to
follow
a
philosophical
speculation
wheresoever
it
may
lead
and
also
be
so
far
indifferent
to
worldly
success
as
to
consider
it
of
small
account
compared
to
spiritual
knowledge
especially
if
such
knowledge
appeared
within
reach
and
involved
worldly
sacrifices
he
further
added
that
a
life
of
loneliness
in
the
country
would
have
to
be
faced
and
that
the
man
who
suited
him
and
worked
faithfully
should
find
compensation
by
inheriting
his
own
rather
considerable
property
when
the
time
came
for
the
rest
he
asked
no
references
and
gave
none
in
a
question
of
spiritual
values
references
were
mere
foolishness
each
must
judge
intuitively
for
himself
spinrobin
as
has
been
said
bit
the
letters
written
in
a
fine
scholarly
handwriting
excited
his
interest
extraordinarily
he
imagined
some
possessed
by
a
singular
hobby
searching
for
things
of
the
spirit
by
those
devious
ways
he
had
heard
about
from
time
to
time
a
little
mad
probably
into
the
bargain
the
name
skale
sounded
to
him
big
yet
he
somehow
pictured
to
himself
an
man
of
small
stature
pursuing
in
solitude
some
impossible
ideal
it
all
attracted
him
hugely
with
its
promise
of
adventure
in
his
own
phrase
it
might
lead
to
something
and
the
hints
about
experiments
in
sound
set
chords
trembling
in
him
that
had
not
vibrated
since
the
days
of
his
boyhood
belief
in
names
and
the
significance
of
names
the
salary
besides
was
good
he
was
accordingly
thrilled
and
delighted
to
receive
in
reply
to
his
last
letter
a
telegram
which
read
engage
you
trial
both
sides
take
single
ticket
skale
i
like
that
single
ticket
he
said
to
himself
as
he
sped
westwards
into
wales
dressed
in
his
usual
fluffy
tweed
suit
and
anarchist
tie
upon
his
knees
lay
a
brand
new
hebrew
grammar
which
he
studied
diligently
all
the
way
to
cardiff
and
still
carried
in
his
hands
when
he
changed
into
the
local
train
that
carried
him
laboriously
into
the
desolation
of
the
pontwaun
mountains
it
looks
as
though
he
approved
of
me
already
my
name
apparently
has
put
him
off
as
it
does
most
people
perhaps
through
it
he
divines
the
real
me
he
smoothed
down
his
rebellious
hair
as
he
neared
the
station
in
the
dusk
but
he
was
surprised
to
find
only
a
rickety
little
cart
drawn
by
a
donkey
sent
to
meet
him
the
house
being
five
miles
distant
in
the
hills
and
still
more
surprised
when
a
huge
figure
of
a
man
hatless
dressed
in
knickerbockers
and
with
a
large
floating
grey
beard
strode
down
the
platform
as
he
gave
up
his
ticket
to
the
and
announced
himself
as
philip
skale
he
had
expected
the
small
individual
of
his
imagination
and
the
shock
momentarily
deprived
him
of
speech
spinrobin
of
course
i
am
skale
philip
skale
the
voice
can
only
be
described
as
booming
it
was
so
deep
and
vibrating
but
the
smile
of
welcome
where
it
escaped
with
difficulty
from
the
network
of
beard
and
moustaches
was
winning
and
almost
gentle
in
contradistinction
to
the
volume
of
that
authoritative
voice
spinrobin
felt
slightly
bewildered
caught
up
into
a
whirlwind
that
drove
too
many
impressions
through
his
brain
for
any
particular
one
to
be
seized
and
mastered
he
found
himself
shaking
hands
skale
rather
shaking
his
in
a
capacious
grasp
as
though
it
were
some
small
indiarubber
ball
to
be
squeezed
and
flung
away
skale
flung
it
away
he
felt
the
shock
up
the
whole
length
of
his
arm
to
the
shoulder
his
first
impressions
he
declares
he
can
not
remember
they
were
too
tumultuous
beyond
that
he
liked
both
smile
and
voice
the
former
making
him
feel
at
home
the
latter
filling
him
to
the
brim
with
a
peculiar
sense
of
never
before
had
he
heard
his
name
pronounced
in
quite
the
same
way
it
sounded
dignified
even
splendid
the
way
skale
spoke
it
beyond
this
general
impression
however
he
can
only
say
that
his
thoughts
and
feelings
whirled
something
emanated
from
this
giant
clergyman
that
was
somewhat
enveloping
and
took
him
off
his
feet
the
keynote
of
the
man
had
been
struck
at
once
how
do
you
do
sir
this
the
train
you
mentioned
i
think
spinrobin
heard
his
own
thin
voice
speaking
by
way
as
it
were
of
instinctive
apology
that
he
should
have
put
such
a
man
to
the
trouble
of
coming
to
meet
him
he
said
sir
it
seemed
unavoidable
for
there
was
nothing
of
the
clergyman
about
him
bishop
perhaps
or
archbishop
but
no
suggestion
of
vicar
or
parish
priest
somewhere
too
in
his
presentment
he
felt
dimly
even
at
the
first
there
was
an
element
of
the
incongruous
a
meeting
of
things
not
usually
found
together
the
vigorous
life
of
the
mountaineer
spoke
in
the
great
muscular
body
with
the
broad
shoulders
and
clean
straight
limbs
but
behind
the
brusqueness
of
manner
lay
the
true
gentleness
of
fine
breeding
and
even
here
on
this
platform
of
the
lonely
mountain
station
spinrobin
detected
the
atmosphere
of
the
scholar
almost
of
the
recluse
shot
through
with
the
strange
fires
that
dropped
from
the
large
lambent
blue
eyes
all
these
things
rushed
over
the
thrilled
little
secretary
with
an
effect
as
already
described
of
a
certain
bewilderment
that
left
no
single
dominant
impression
what
remained
with
him
perhaps
most
vividly
he
says
was
the
quality
of
the
big
blue
eyes
their
luminosity
their
expression
their
kindliness
they
were
the
eyes
of
the
true
visionary
but
in
such
a
personality
they
proclaimed
the
mystic
who
had
retained
his
health
of
soul
and
body
skale
was
surely
a
visionary
but
just
as
surely
a
wholesome
man
of
action
probably
of
terrific
action
spinrobin
felt
irresistibly
drawn
to
him
it
is
not
unpleasant
i
trust
the
other
was
saying
in
his
deep
tones
to
find
some
one
to
meet
you
and
he
added
with
a
genial
laugh
to
counteract
the
first
impression
of
this
somewhat
melancholy
and
inhospitable
scenery
his
arm
swept
out
to
indicate
the
dreary
little
station
and
the
bleak
and
lowering
landscape
of
treeless
hills
in
the
dusk
the
new
secretary
made
some
appropriate
reply
his
sense
of
loneliness
already
dissipated
in
part
by
the
unexpected
welcome
and
they
fell
to
arrangements
about
the
luggage
you
wo
mind
walking
said
skale
with
a
finality
that
anticipated
only
agreement
it
a
short
five
miles
the
will
take
the
portmanteau
upon
which
they
started
off
at
a
pace
that
made
the
little
man
wonder
whether
he
could
possibly
keep
it
up
we
shall
get
in
before
dark
explained
the
other
striding
along
with
ease
and
mawle
my
housekeeper
will
have
tea
ready
and
waiting
for
us
spinrobin
followed
panting
thinking
vaguely
of
the
other
employers
he
had
known
philanthropists
bankers
ambitious
members
of
parliament
and
all
the
rest
commonplace
individuals
to
a
man
and
then
of
the
immense
and
towering
figure
striding
just
ahead
shedding
about
him
this
vibrating
atmosphere
of
power
and
whirlwind
touched
so
oddly
here
and
there
with
a
vein
of
gentleness
that
was
almost
sweetness
never
before
had
he
known
any
human
being
who
radiated
such
vigor
such
big
and
beneficent
fatherliness
yet
for
all
the
air
of
kindliness
something
too
that
touched
in
him
the
sense
of
awe
skale
he
felt
was
a
very
unusual
man
they
went
on
in
the
gathering
dusk
talking
little
but
easily
spinrobin
felt
taken
care
of
usually
he
was
shy
with
a
new
employer
but
this
man
inspired
much
too
large
a
sensation
in
him
to
include
shyness
or
any
other
form
of
petty
he
felt
more
like
a
son
than
a
secretary
he
remembered
the
wording
of
the
advertisement
the
phrases
of
the
singular
correspondence
and
wondered
a
remarkable
personality
he
thought
to
himself
as
he
stumbled
through
the
dark
after
the
object
of
his
reflections
simple
yet
tremendous
a
giant
in
all
sorts
of
ways
probably
then
his
thought
hesitated
floundered
there
was
something
else
he
divined
yet
could
not
name
he
felt
out
of
his
depth
in
some
entirely
new
way
in
touch
with
an
order
of
possibilities
larger
more
vast
more
remote
than
any
dreams
his
imagination
even
had
yet
envisaged
all
this
and
more
the
mere
presence
of
this
retired
clergyman
poured
into
his
receptive
and
eager
little
soul
and
very
soon
it
was
that
these
nameless
qualities
began
to
assert
themselves
completing
the
rout
of
spinrobin
moderate
powers
of
judgment
no
practical
word
as
to
the
work
before
them
or
the
duties
of
the
new
secretary
had
yet
passed
between
them
they
walked
along
together
chatting
as
equals
acquaintances
almost
two
friends
might
have
done
and
on
the
top
of
the
hill
after
a
trudge
they
rested
for
the
first
time
spinrobin
panting
and
perspiring
trousers
tucked
up
and
splashed
yellow
with
mud
skale
legs
apart
beard
flattened
by
the
wind
about
his
throat
and
thumbs
in
the
slits
of
his
waistcoat
as
he
looked
keenly
about
him
over
the
darkening
landscape
treeless
and
desolate
hills
rose
on
all
sides
a
few
cottages
of
grey
stone
lay
scattered
upon
the
lower
slopes
among
patches
of
shabby
and
forlorn
cultivation
here
and
there
an
outcrop
of
rock
ran
skywards
into
somber
and
precipitous
ridges
the
october
wind
passed
to
and
fro
over
it
all
mournfully
singing
and
driving
loose
clouds
that
seemed
to
drop
weighted
shadows
among
the
peaks
iii
and
it
was
here
that
skale
stopped
abruptly
looked
about
him
and
then
down
at
his
companion
bleak
and
lonely
this
great
spread
of
bare
mountain
and
falling
cliff
he
observed
half
to
himself
half
to
the
other
but
fine
very
very
fine
he
exhaled
deeply
then
inhaled
as
though
the
great
draught
of
air
was
profoundly
satisfying
he
turned
to
catch
his
eye
there
a
savage
and
desolate
beauty
here
that
uplifts
it
helps
the
mind
to
dwell
upon
the
full
sweep
of
life
instead
of
getting
dwarfed
and
lost
among
its
petty
details
pretty
scenery
is
not
good
for
the
soul
and
again
he
inhaled
a
prodigious
breastful
of
the
mountain
air
this
is
but
an
element
of
terror
in
it
perhaps
sir
suggested
the
secretary
who
truth
to
tell
preferred
his
scenery
more
smiling
and
who
further
had
been
made
suddenly
aware
that
in
this
somber
setting
of
bleak
and
elemental
nature
the
great
figure
of
his
future
employer
assumed
a
certain
air
of
grandeur
that
was
a
little
too
to
be
pleasant
in
all
profound
beauty
there
must
be
that
the
clergyman
was
saying
fine
terror
i
mean
of
course
just
enough
to
bring
out
the
littleness
of
man
by
comparison
perhaps
yes
agreed
spinrobin
his
own
insignificance
seemed
peculiarly
apparent
at
that
moment
in
contrast
to
skale
who
had
become
part
and
parcel
of
the
rugged
landscape
spinrobin
was
a
lost
atom
whirling
somewhere
outside
on
his
own
account
whereas
the
other
seemed
oddly
in
touch
with
it
almost
merged
and
incorporated
into
it
with
those
deep
breaths
the
clergyman
absorbed
something
of
this
latent
power
about
them
then
gave
it
out
again
it
broke
over
his
companion
like
a
wave
elemental
force
of
some
kind
emanated
from
that
massive
human
figure
beside
him
the
wind
came
tearing
up
the
valley
and
swept
past
them
with
a
rush
as
of
mighty
wings
skale
drew
attention
to
it
and
listen
to
that
he
said
how
it
leaps
singing
from
the
woods
in
the
valley
up
to
those
gaunt
old
cliffs
yonder
he
pointed
his
beard
blew
suddenly
across
his
face
with
his
bare
head
and
shaggy
flying
hair
his
big
eyes
and
bold
aquiline
nose
he
presented
an
impressive
figure
spinrobin
watched
him
with
growing
amazement
aware
that
an
enthusiasm
scarcely
warranted
by
the
wind
and
scenery
had
passed
into
his
manner
in
his
own
person
too
he
thought
he
experienced
a
birth
of
something
similar
a
little
wild
rush
of
delight
he
was
unable
to
account
for
the
voice
of
his
companion
pointing
out
the
house
in
the
valley
below
again
interrupted
his
thoughts
how
the
mountains
positively
eat
it
up
it
lies
in
their
very
jaws
and
the
secretary
eyes
traveling
into
the
depths
made
out
a
cluster
of
grey
stone
chimneys
and
a
clearing
in
the
woods
that
evidently
represented
lawns
the
phrase
courage
and
imagination
flashed
unbidden
into
his
mind
as
he
realized
the
loneliness
of
the
situation
and
for
the
hundredth
time
he
wondered
what
in
the
world
could
be
the
experiments
with
sound
that
this
extraordinary
man
pursued
in
this
isolated
old
mansion
among
the
hills
buried
sir
rather
he
suggested
i
can
only
just
see
it
and
inaccessible
skale
interrupted
him
hard
to
get
at
no
one
comes
to
disturb
an
ideal
place
for
work
in
the
hollows
of
these
hills
a
man
may
indeed
seek
truth
and
pursue
it
for
the
world
does
not
enter
here
he
paused
a
moment
i
hope
spinrobin
he
added
turning
towards
him
with
that
gentle
smile
his
shaggy
visage
sometimes
wore
i
hope
you
will
not
find
it
too
lonely
we
have
no
visitors
i
mean
nothing
but
our
own
little
household
of
four
spinrobin
smiled
back
even
at
this
stage
he
admits
he
was
exceedingly
anxious
to
suit
skale
in
spite
of
his
marked
peculiarities
inspired
him
with
confidence
his
personal
attraction
was
growing
every
minute
that
vague
awe
he
roused
probably
only
increased
it
he
wondered
who
the
four
might
be
there
nothing
like
solitude
for
serious
work
sir
replied
the
younger
man
stifling
a
passing
uneasiness
and
with
that
they
plunged
down
the
hillside
into
the
valley
skale
leading
the
way
at
a
terrific
pace
shouting
out
instructions
and
warnings
from
time
to
time
that
echoed
from
the
rocks
as
though
voices
followed
them
down
from
the
mountains
the
darkness
swallowed
them
they
left
the
wind
behind
the
silence
that
dwells
in
the
folded
hills
fell
about
their
steps
the
air
grew
less
keen
the
trees
multiplied
gathering
them
in
with
fingers
of
mist
and
shadow
only
the
clatter
of
their
boots
on
the
rocky
path
and
the
heavy
bass
of
the
voice
shouting
instructions
from
time
to
time
broke
the
stillness
spinrobin
followed
the
big
dark
outline
in
front
of
him
as
best
he
could
stumbling
frequently
with
countless
little
hopping
steps
he
dodged
along
from
point
to
point
a
certain
lucky
nimbleness
in
his
twinkling
feet
saving
him
from
many
a
tumble
all
right
behind
there
skale
would
thunder
all
right
thanks
skale
he
would
reply
in
his
thin
tenor
i
coming
come
along
then
and
on
they
would
go
faster
than
before
till
in
due
course
they
emerged
from
the
encircling
woods
and
reached
the
more
open
ground
about
the
house
somehow
in
the
jostling
relations
of
the
walk
a
freedom
of
intercourse
had
been
established
that
no
amount
of
formal
talk
between
four
walls
could
have
accomplished
they
scraped
their
dirty
boots
vigorously
on
the
iron
mat
tired
asked
the
clergyman
kindly
winded
skale
thank
you
nothing
more
was
the
reply
he
looked
up
at
the
square
mass
of
the
house
looming
dark
against
the
sky
and
the
noise
his
companion
made
opening
the
door
the
actual
rattle
of
the
iron
knob
did
it
suddenly
brought
to
him
a
clear
realization
of
two
things
first
he
understood
that
the
whole
way
from
the
station
skale
had
been
watching
him
closely
weighing
testing
proving
him
though
by
ways
and
methods
so
subtle
that
they
had
escaped
his
observation
at
the
time
secondly
that
he
was
already
so
caught
in
the
network
of
this
personality
vaster
and
more
powerful
than
his
own
that
escape
if
he
desired
it
would
be
exceedingly
difficult
like
a
man
in
a
boat
upon
the
upper
niagara
river
he
already
felt
the
tug
and
suction
of
the
current
below
the
lust
of
a
great
adventure
drawing
him
forward
hand
upon
his
shoulder
as
they
entered
the
house
was
the
symbol
of
the
noise
of
the
door
closing
behind
him
was
the
passing
of
the
last
bit
of
quiet
water
across
which
a
landing
to
the
bank
might
still
have
been
possible
faint
streamers
from
the
dark
inscrutable
house
of
fear
reached
him
even
then
and
left
their
vague
undecipherable
signatures
upon
the
surface
of
his
soul
the
forces
that
vibrated
so
strangely
in
the
atmosphere
of
skale
were
already
playing
about
his
own
person
gathering
him
in
like
a
garment
yet
while
he
shuddered
he
liked
it
was
he
not
already
losing
something
of
his
own
insignificant
and
diminutive
self
iv
the
clergyman
meanwhile
had
closed
the
heavy
door
shutting
out
the
darkness
and
now
led
the
way
across
a
large
flagged
hall
into
a
room
ablaze
with
lamp
and
fire
the
walls
lined
thickly
with
books
furnished
cozily
if
plainly
the
laden
tea
table
and
a
kettle
hissing
merrily
on
the
hob
were
pleasant
to
look
upon
but
what
instantly
arrested
the
gaze
of
the
secretary
was
the
face
of
the
old
woman
in
cap
and
apron
evidently
the
housekeeper
already
referred
to
as
mawle
who
stood
waiting
to
pour
out
tea
for
about
her
worn
and
wrinkled
countenance
there
lay
an
indefinable
touch
of
something
that
hitherto
he
had
seen
only
in
pictures
of
the
saints
by
the
old
masters
what
attracted
his
attention
and
held
it
so
arrestingly
was
this
singular
expression
of
happiness
aye
of
more
than
mere
happiness
of
joy
and
peace
and
blessed
surety
rarely
if
ever
seen
upon
a
human
face
alive
and
only
here
and
there
suggested
behind
that
mask
of
repose
which
death
leaves
so
tenderly
upon
the
features
of
those
few
who
have
lived
their
lives
to
noblest
advantage
spinrobin
caught
his
breath
a
little
and
stared
aged
and
lined
as
it
unquestionably
was
he
caught
that
ineffable
suggestion
of
radiance
about
it
which
proclaimed
an
inner
life
that
had
found
itself
and
was
in
perfect
harmony
with
outer
things
a
life
based
upon
certain
knowledge
and
certain
hope
it
wore
a
gentle
whiteness
he
could
find
only
one
word
to
describe
glory
and
the
moment
he
saw
it
there
flashed
across
him
the
recognition
that
this
was
what
skale
also
possessed
that
giant
athletic
vigorous
man
and
this
bent
worn
old
woman
both
had
it
he
wondered
with
a
rush
of
sudden
joy
what
produced
it
whether
it
might
perhaps
one
day
be
his
too
the
flame
of
his
own
spirit
leapt
within
him
and
so
wondering
he
turned
to
look
at
the
clergyman
in
the
softer
light
of
fire
and
lamp
his
face
had
the
appearance
of
forty
rather
than
sixty
as
he
had
first
judged
the
eyes
always
luminous
shone
with
health
and
enthusiasm
a
great
air
of
youth
and
vitality
glowed
about
him
it
was
a
fine
head
with
that
dominating
nose
and
the
shaggy
tangle
of
hair
and
beard
very
big
fatherly
and
protective
he
looked
a
quite
inexpressible
air
of
tenderness
mingled
in
everywhere
with
the
strength
spinrobin
felt
immensely
drawn
to
him
as
he
looked
with
such
a
leader
he
could
go
anywhere
do
anything
there
surely
was
a
man
whose
heart
was
set
not
upon
the
things
of
this
world
an
introduction
to
the
housekeeper
interrupted
his
reflections
it
did
not
strike
him
as
at
all
out
of
the
way
doubtless
she
was
more
mother
than
domestic
to
the
household
at
the
name
of
mawle
obviously
he
rose
and
bowed
and
the
old
woman
looking
from
one
to
the
other
smiled
becomingly
curtseyed
put
her
cap
straight
and
turned
to
the
teapot
again
she
said
nothing
the
only
servant
i
have
practically
explained
the
clergyman
cook
butler
housekeeper
and
tyrant
all
in
one
and
with
her
niece
the
only
other
persons
in
the
house
besides
ourselves
a
very
simple
you
see
spinrobin
i
ought
to
warn
you
too
he
added
that
she
is
almost
stone
deaf
and
has
only
got
the
use
of
one
arm
as
perhaps
you
noticed
her
left
arm
is
he
hesitated
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
withered
a
passing
wonder
as
to
what
the
niece
would
be
like
accompanied
the
swallowing
of
his
buttered
toast
and
tea
but
the
personalities
of
skale
and
his
housekeeper
had
already
produced
emotions
that
prevented
this
curiosity
acquiring
much
strength
he
could
deal
with
nothing
more
just
yet
bewilderment
obstructed
the
way
and
in
his
room
before
dinner
he
tried
in
vain
to
sort
out
the
impressions
that
so
thickly
flooded
him
though
without
any
conspicuous
degree
of
success
the
walls
of
his
bedroom
like
those
of
corridor
and
hall
were
bare
the
furniture
solid
and
scanty
perhaps
yet
more
than
he
was
accustomed
to
and
the
spaciousness
was
very
pleasant
after
the
cramped
quarters
of
stuffy
london
lodgings
he
unpacked
his
few
things
arranged
them
with
neat
precision
in
the
drawers
of
the
tallboy
counted
his
shirts
socks
and
ties
to
see
that
all
was
right
and
then
drew
up
an
armchair
and
toasted
his
toes
before
the
comforting
fire
he
tried
to
think
of
many
things
and
to
decide
numerous
little
questions
roused
by
the
events
of
the
last
few
hours
but
the
only
thing
it
seems
that
really
occupied
his
mind
was
the
rather
overpowering
fact
that
he
was
with
skale
and
in
skale
house
that
he
was
there
on
a
month
trial
that
the
nature
of
the
work
in
which
he
was
to
assist
was
unknown
immense
singular
and
that
he
was
already
being
weighed
in
the
balances
by
his
uncommon
and
gigantic
employer
in
his
mind
he
used
this
very
adjective
there
was
something
about
the
big
clergyman
titanic
he
was
in
the
middle
of
a
somewhat
jumbled
consideration
about
knowledge
of
hebrew
tenor
voice
courage
and
imagination
unworldly
and
so
forth
when
a
knock
at
the
door
announced
mawle
who
came
to
inform
him
that
dinner
was
ready
she
stood
there
a
motherly
and
pleasant
figure
in
black
and
she
addressed
him
in
the
third
person
if
spinrobin
will
please
to
come
down
she
said
skale
is
waiting
skale
is
always
punctual
she
always
spoke
thus
in
the
third
person
she
never
used
the
personal
pronoun
if
it
could
be
avoided
she
preferred
the
name
direct
it
seemed
and
as
spinrobin
passed
her
on
the
way
out
she
observed
further
looking
straight
into
his
eyes
as
she
said
it
and
should
spinrobin
have
need
of
anything
indicating
it
is
the
bell
that
rings
in
the
housekeeper
room
mawle
can
see
it
wag
though
she
ca
hear
it
day
or
night
she
added
with
a
faint
curtsey
and
no
trouble
at
all
just
as
with
the
other
gentlemen
so
there
had
been
other
gentlemen
other
secretaries
he
thanked
her
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
and
hurried
pattering
downstairs
in
a
neat
blue
suit
black
silk
socks
and
a
pair
of
bright
new
pumps
skale
having
told
him
not
to
dress
the
phrase
day
or
night
meanwhile
struck
him
as
significant
and
peculiar
he
remembered
it
later
at
the
moment
he
merely
noted
that
it
added
one
more
to
the
puzzling
items
that
caused
his
bewilderment
v
before
he
had
gone
very
far
however
there
came
another
crowningly
perplexing
for
he
was
halfway
down
the
darkened
passage
making
for
the
hall
that
glimmered
beyond
like
the
mouth
of
a
cave
when
without
the
smallest
warning
he
became
suddenly
conscious
that
something
attractive
and
utterly
delicious
had
invaded
the
stream
of
his
being
it
came
from
nowhere
inexplicably
and
at
first
it
took
the
form
of
a
naked
sensation
of
delight
keen
as
a
thrill
of
boyhood
days
there
passed
into
him
very
swiftly
something
that
satisfied
i
mean
whatever
it
was
he
says
i
could
have
asked
or
wanted
more
of
it
it
was
all
there
complete
supreme
sufficient
and
the
same
instant
he
saw
close
beside
him
in
the
comparative
gloom
of
the
narrow
corridor
a
vivid
vibrating
picture
of
a
girl
face
pale
as
marble
of
beauty
with
dark
voluminous
hair
and
large
grey
eyes
that
met
his
own
from
behind
a
wavering
net
of
eyelashes
down
to
the
shoulders
he
saw
her
erect
and
motionless
she
stood
against
the
wall
to
let
him
pass
this
slim
young
girl
whose
sudden
and
unexpected
presence
had
so
electrified
him
her
eyes
followed
him
like
those
of
a
picture
but
she
neither
bowed
nor
curtseyed
and
the
only
movement
she
made
was
the
slight
turning
of
the
head
and
eyes
as
he
went
by
it
was
extraordinarily
effective
this
silent
and
delightful
introduction
for
swift
as
lightning
and
with
lightning
terrific
and
incalculable
surety
of
aim
she
leapt
into
his
heart
with
the
effect
of
a
blinding
and
complete
possession
it
was
of
course
he
realized
the
niece
the
fourth
member
of
the
household
and
the
first
clear
thought
to
disentangle
itself
from
the
resultant
jumble
of
emotions
was
his
instinctive
wonder
what
her
name
might
be
how
was
this
delightful
apparition
called
this
was
the
question
that
ran
and
danced
in
his
blood
in
another
minute
he
felt
sure
he
would
discover
it
it
must
begin
he
felt
sure
of
that
with
an
he
did
not
pause
or
alter
his
pace
he
made
no
sign
of
recognition
their
eyes
swallowed
each
other
for
a
brief
moment
as
he
passed
and
then
he
was
pattering
with
quick
excited
steps
down
the
passage
beyond
and
the
girl
was
left
out
of
sight
in
the
shadows
behind
him
he
did
not
even
turn
back
to
look
for
in
some
amazing
sense
she
seemed
to
move
on
beside
him
as
though
some
portion
of
her
had
merged
into
his
being
he
carried
her
on
with
him
some
sweet
and
marvelous
interchange
they
had
undergone
together
he
felt
strangely
blessed
soothed
inwardly
made
complete
and
more
than
twice
on
the
way
down
the
name
he
knew
must
belong
to
her
almost
sprang
up
and
revealed
itself
yet
never
quite
he
knew
it
began
with
m
even
with
mir
but
could
get
nothing
more
the
rest
evaded
him
he
divined
only
a
portion
of
the
name
he
had
seen
only
a
portion
of
her
form
the
first
syllable
however
sang
in
him
with
an
exquisitely
sweet
authority
he
was
aware
of
some
glorious
new
thing
in
the
penetralia
of
his
little
spirit
vibrating
with
happiness
some
portion
of
himself
sang
with
it
for
it
really
did
vibrate
he
said
and
no
other
word
describes
it
it
vibrated
like
music
like
a
string
as
though
when
i
passed
her
she
had
taken
a
bow
and
drawn
it
across
the
strings
of
my
inmost
being
to
make
them
sing
come
broke
in
the
sonorous
voice
of
the
clergyman
whom
he
found
standing
in
the
hall
i
been
waiting
for
you
it
was
said
not
complainingly
nor
with
any
idea
of
but
rather
both
tone
and
manner
betrayed
it
as
a
prelude
to
something
of
importance
about
to
follow
somewhat
impatiently
skale
took
his
companion
by
the
arm
and
led
him
forwards
on
the
stone
floor
footsteps
sounded
light
and
dancing
like
a
child
the
clergyman
strode
at
the
dining
room
door
he
stopped
turning
abruptly
and
at
the
same
instant
the
figure
of
the
young
girl
glided
noiselessly
towards
them
from
the
mouth
of
the
dark
corridor
where
she
had
been
waiting
her
entry
again
was
curiously
effective
like
a
beautiful
thought
in
a
dream
she
moved
into
the
hall
and
into
spinrobin
life
moreover
as
she
came
wholly
into
view
in
the
light
he
felt
as
positively
as
though
he
heard
it
uttered
that
he
knew
her
name
complete
the
first
syllable
had
come
to
him
in
the
passageway
when
he
saw
her
partly
and
the
feeling
of
dread
that
mir
might
prove
to
be
part
of
miranda
myrtle
or
some
other
enormity
passed
instantly
these
would
only
have
been
gross
and
cruel
misnomers
her
right
name
the
only
one
that
described
her
soul
must
end
as
it
began
with
it
flashed
into
his
mind
and
at
the
same
moment
skale
picked
it
off
his
very
lips
miriam
he
said
in
deep
tones
rolling
the
name
along
his
mouth
so
as
to
extract
every
shade
of
sound
belonging
to
it
this
is
spinrobin
about
whom
i
told
you
he
is
coming
i
hope
to
help
us
vi
at
first
spinrobin
was
only
aware
of
the
keen
delight
produced
in
him
by
the
manner
of
skale
uttering
her
name
for
it
entered
his
consciousness
with
a
murmuring
singing
sound
that
continued
on
in
his
thoughts
like
a
melody
his
racing
blood
carried
it
to
every
portion
of
his
body
he
heard
her
name
not
with
his
ears
alone
but
with
his
whole
person
a
melodious
haunting
phrase
of
music
that
thrilled
him
exquisitely
next
he
knew
that
she
stood
close
before
him
shaking
his
hand
and
looking
straight
into
his
eyes
with
an
expression
of
the
most
complete
trust
and
sympathy
imaginable
and
that
he
felt
a
irresistible
desire
to
draw
her
yet
closer
to
him
and
kiss
her
little
shining
face
thirdly
though
the
three
impressions
were
as
a
matter
of
fact
almost
simultaneous
that
the
huge
figure
of
the
clergyman
stood
behind
them
watching
with
the
utmost
intentness
and
interest
like
a
keen
and
alert
detective
eager
for
some
betrayal
of
evidence
inspired
however
not
by
mistrust
but
by
a
very
zealous
sympathy
he
understood
that
this
meeting
was
of
paramount
importance
in
skale
purpose
how
do
you
do
spinrobin
he
heard
a
soft
voice
saying
and
the
commonplace
phrase
served
to
bring
him
back
to
a
more
normal
standard
of
things
but
the
tone
in
which
she
said
it
caused
him
a
second
thrill
almost
more
delightful
than
the
first
for
the
quality
was
low
and
fluty
like
the
gentle
note
of
some
mellow
wind
instrument
and
the
caressing
way
she
pronounced
his
name
was
a
revelation
skale
had
known
how
to
make
it
sound
dignified
but
this
girl
did
more
she
made
it
sound
alive
i
will
give
thee
a
new
name
flashed
into
his
thoughts
as
some
of
boyhood
discharged
its
little
burden
most
opportunely
and
proceeded
to
refill
itself
the
smile
of
happiness
that
broke
over
spinrobin
face
was
certainly
reflected
in
the
eyes
that
gazed
so
searchingly
into
his
own
without
the
smallest
sign
of
immodesty
yet
without
the
least
inclination
to
drop
the
eyelids
the
two
natures
ran
out
to
meet
each
other
as
naturally
as
two
notes
of
music
run
to
take
their
places
in
a
chord
this
slight
youth
light
of
hair
and
sensitive
of
spirit
and
this
slim
little
maiden
with
the
voice
of
music
and
the
grey
eyes
understood
one
another
from
the
very
first
instant
their
atmospheres
touched
and
mingled
and
the
big
skale
looking
on
intently
over
their
very
shoulders
saw
that
it
was
good
and
smiled
down
upon
them
too
in
his
turn
the
harmony
of
souls
and
voices
is
complete
he
said
but
in
so
low
a
tone
that
the
secretary
did
not
hear
it
then
with
a
hand
on
a
shoulder
of
each
he
half
pushed
them
before
him
into
the
dining
room
his
whole
face
running
as
it
were
into
a
single
big
smile
of
contentment
the
important
event
had
turned
out
to
his
entire
satisfaction
he
looked
like
some
beneficent
father
well
pleased
with
his
two
children
but
spinrobin
as
he
moved
beside
the
girl
and
heard
the
rustle
of
her
dress
that
almost
touched
him
felt
as
though
he
stood
upon
a
sliding
platform
that
was
moving
ever
quicker
and
that
the
adventure
upon
which
he
was
embarked
had
now
acquired
a
momentum
that
nothing
he
could
do
would
ever
stop
and
he
liked
it
it
would
carry
him
out
of
himself
into
something
very
big
and
at
dinner
where
he
sat
opposite
to
the
girl
and
studied
her
face
closely
skale
he
was
soon
aware
was
occupied
in
studying
the
two
of
them
even
more
closely
he
appeared
always
to
be
listening
to
their
voices
they
spoke
little
enough
however
only
their
eyes
met
continually
and
when
they
did
so
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
desire
to
withdraw
their
gaze
remained
fastened
on
one
another
on
her
part
without
shyness
without
impudence
on
his
that
skale
wished
for
them
an
intimate
and
even
affectionate
understanding
was
evident
and
the
secretary
warmed
to
him
on
that
account
more
than
ever
if
on
no
other
it
surprised
him
too
when
he
thought
of
it
which
was
rarely
that
a
girl
who
was
perforce
of
humble
origin
could
carry
herself
with
an
air
of
such
complete
and
natural
distinction
and
prove
herself
so
absolutely
the
lady
for
there
was
something
about
her
of
greater
value
than
any
mere
earthly
rank
or
class
could
confer
her
spirit
was
in
its
very
essence
distinguished
perfectly
simple
yet
strong
with
a
great
and
natural
pride
it
never
occurred
to
her
soul
to
doubt
its
own
great
value
or
to
question
that
of
others
she
somehow
or
other
made
the
little
secretary
feel
of
great
account
he
had
never
quite
realized
his
own
value
before
her
presence
her
eyes
her
voice
served
to
bring
it
out
and
a
very
curious
detail
that
he
always
mentions
just
at
this
point
is
the
fact
that
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
wonder
what
her
surname
might
be
or
whether
indeed
she
had
one
at
all
her
name
miriam
seemed
sufficient
the
rest
of
her
if
there
was
any
other
part
of
her
not
described
by
those
three
syllables
lay
safely
and
naturally
included
somewhere
in
name
spinrobin
described
her
as
well
as
himself
but
miriam
completed
his
own
personality
and
at
the
same
time
extended
it
he
felt
all
wrapped
up
and
at
peace
with
her
with
philip
skale
mawle
and
miriam
he
robert
spinrobin
felt
that
he
naturally
belonged
as
one
of
the
family
they
were
like
the
four
notes
in
the
chord
skale
the
great
bass
mawle
the
mellow
alto
himself
and
miriam
respectively
the
echoing
tenor
and
the
singing
soprano
the
imagery
by
which
in
the
depths
of
his
mind
he
sought
to
interpret
to
himself
the
whole
singular
business
ran
it
seems
even
then
to
music
and
the
analogies
of
music
the
meal
was
short
and
very
simple
mawle
carved
the
joint
at
the
end
of
the
table
handed
the
vegetables
and
looked
after
their
wants
with
the
precision
of
long
habit
her
skill
in
spite
of
the
withered
arm
was
noteworthy
they
talked
little
skale
hardly
at
all
miriam
spoke
from
time
to
time
across
the
table
to
the
secretary
she
did
not
ask
questions
she
stated
facts
as
though
she
already
knew
all
about
his
feelings
and
tastes
she
may
have
been
twenty
years
of
age
perhaps
but
in
some
way
she
took
him
back
to
childhood
and
she
said
things
with
the
simple
audacity
of
a
child
ignoring
skale
presence
it
seemed
to
the
secretary
as
if
he
had
always
known
her
i
knew
just
how
you
would
look
she
said
without
a
trace
of
shyness
the
moment
i
heard
your
name
and
you
got
my
name
very
quickly
too
only
part
of
it
at
first
oh
yes
but
when
you
saw
me
completely
you
got
it
all
she
interrupted
and
i
like
your
name
she
added
looking
him
full
in
the
eye
with
her
soft
grey
orbs
it
tells
everything
so
does
yours
you
know
oh
of
course
she
laughed
skale
gave
it
to
me
the
day
i
was
born
i
it
put
in
the
clergyman
speaking
almost
for
the
first
time
and
the
talk
dropped
again
the
secretary
head
fairly
whirling
you
used
it
all
of
course
as
a
little
boy
she
said
presently
again
names
i
mean
rather
he
replied
without
hesitation
only
i
rather
lost
it
since
it
will
come
back
to
you
here
it
so
splendid
all
this
world
of
sound
and
makes
everything
seem
worth
while
but
you
lose
your
way
at
first
of
course
especially
if
you
are
out
of
practice
as
you
must
be
spinrobin
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
hear
this
young
girl
make
use
of
such
language
took
his
breath
away
he
became
aware
that
she
was
talking
with
a
purpose
seconding
skale
in
the
secret
examination
to
which
the
clergyman
was
all
the
time
subjecting
him
yet
there
was
no
element
of
alarm
in
it
all
in
the
room
with
these
two
and
with
the
motherly
figure
of
the
housekeeper
busying
about
to
and
fro
he
felt
at
home
comforted
looked
after
more
even
he
felt
at
his
best
as
though
the
stream
of
his
little
life
were
mingling
in
with
a
much
bigger
and
worthier
river
a
river
moreover
in
flood
but
it
was
the
imagery
of
music
again
that
most
readily
occurred
to
him
he
felt
that
the
note
of
his
own
little
personality
had
been
caught
up
into
the
comforting
bosom
of
a
complete
chord
vii
spinrobin
suddenly
sounded
soft
and
low
across
the
table
and
thrilled
to
hear
the
girl
speak
his
name
he
looked
up
quickly
and
found
her
very
eyes
peering
into
his
her
face
was
thrust
forward
a
little
as
she
leaned
over
the
table
in
his
direction
as
he
gazed
she
repeated
his
name
leisurely
quietly
and
even
more
softly
than
before
mr
spinrobin
but
this
time
as
their
eyes
met
and
the
syllables
issued
from
her
lips
he
noticed
that
a
singular
an
exceedingly
soft
yet
vibrant
overtone
accompanied
it
the
syllables
set
something
quivering
within
him
something
that
sang
running
of
its
own
accord
into
a
melody
to
which
his
rising
pulses
beat
time
and
tune
now
please
speak
my
name
she
added
please
look
straight
at
me
straight
into
my
eyes
and
pronounce
name
his
lips
trembled
if
ever
so
slightly
as
he
obeyed
miriam
he
said
pronounce
each
syllable
very
distinctly
and
very
slowly
she
said
her
grey
eyes
all
over
his
burning
face
mir
i
am
he
repeated
looking
in
the
center
of
the
eyes
without
flinching
and
becoming
instantly
aware
that
his
utterance
of
the
name
produced
in
himself
a
development
and
extension
of
the
original
overtones
awakened
by
her
speaking
of
his
own
name
it
was
wonderful
exquisite
delicious
he
uttered
it
again
and
then
heard
that
she
too
was
uttering
his
at
the
same
moment
each
spoke
the
other
name
he
could
have
sworn
he
heard
the
music
within
him
leap
across
the
intervening
space
and
transfer
itself
to
her
and
that
he
heard
his
own
name
singing
too
in
blood
for
the
names
were
true
by
this
soft
intoning
utterance
they
seemed
to
pass
mutually
into
the
secret
rhythm
of
that
eternal
principle
of
speech
which
exists
behind
the
spoken
sound
and
is
independent
of
its
means
of
manifestation
their
central
beings
screened
and
limited
behind
their
names
knew
an
instant
of
synchronous
rhythmical
vibration
it
was
their
introduction
absolute
to
one
another
for
it
was
an
instant
of
naked
revelation
spinrobin
miriam
viii
a
great
volume
of
sound
suddenly
enveloped
and
caught
away
the
two
singing
names
and
the
spell
was
broken
miriam
dropped
her
eyes
spinrobin
looked
up
it
was
skale
voice
upon
them
with
a
shout
splendid
splendid
he
cried
your
voices
like
your
names
are
made
for
one
another
in
quality
pitch
accent
everything
he
was
enthusiastic
rather
than
excited
but
to
spinrobin
taking
part
in
this
astonishing
performance
to
which
the
other
two
alone
held
the
key
it
all
seemed
too
perplexing
for
words
the
great
bass
crashed
and
boomed
for
a
moment
about
his
ears
then
came
silence
the
test
or
whatever
it
was
was
over
it
had
been
successful
skale
his
face
still
shining
with
enthusiasm
turned
towards
him
miriam
equally
happy
watched
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
my
dear
fellow
exclaimed
the
clergyman
half
rising
in
his
chair
how
mad
you
must
think
us
how
mad
you
must
think
us
i
can
only
assure
you
that
when
you
know
more
as
you
soon
shall
you
will
understand
the
importance
of
what
has
just
taken
place
he
said
a
good
deal
more
that
spinrobin
did
not
apparently
quite
take
in
he
was
too
bewildered
his
eyes
sought
the
girl
where
she
sat
opposite
gazing
at
him
for
all
its
pallor
her
face
was
tenderly
soft
and
beautiful
more
pure
and
undefiled
he
thought
than
any
human
countenance
he
had
ever
seen
and
sweet
as
the
face
of
a
child
utterly
unstained
it
was
a
similar
light
shone
in
the
faces
of
skale
and
mawle
in
their
case
it
had
forged
its
way
through
the
more
or
less
defiling
garment
of
a
worn
and
experienced
flesh
but
the
light
in
miriam
eyes
and
skin
was
there
because
it
had
never
been
extinguished
she
had
retained
her
pristine
brilliance
of
soul
through
the
little
spirit
of
the
perplexed
secretary
ran
a
thrill
of
genuine
worship
and
adoration
skale
coffee
is
served
in
the
library
announced
the
voice
of
the
housekeeper
abruptly
behind
them
and
when
spinrobin
turned
again
he
discovered
that
miriam
had
slipped
from
the
room
unobserved
and
was
gone
skale
took
his
companion
arm
and
led
the
way
towards
the
hall
i
am
glad
you
love
her
was
his
astonishing
remark
it
is
the
first
and
most
essential
condition
of
your
suiting
me
she
is
delightful
wonderful
charming
sir
not
if
you
please
replied
the
clergyman
standing
aside
at
the
threshold
for
his
guest
to
pass
i
prefer
the
use
of
the
name
you
know
i
think
it
is
important
and
he
closed
the
library
door
behind
them
chapter
ii
i
for
some
minutes
they
sat
in
front
of
the
fire
and
sipped
their
coffee
in
silence
the
secretary
felt
that
the
sliding
platform
on
which
he
was
traveling
into
this
extraordinary
adventure
had
been
going
a
little
too
fast
for
him
events
had
crowded
past
before
he
had
time
to
look
squarely
at
them
he
had
lost
his
bearings
rather
routed
by
miriam
beauty
and
by
the
amazing
way
she
talked
to
him
had
she
lived
always
inside
his
thoughts
she
could
not
have
chosen
words
better
calculated
to
convince
him
that
they
were
utterly
in
sympathy
one
with
the
other
skale
moreover
approved
heartily
the
one
thing
spinrobin
saw
clearly
through
it
all
was
that
himself
and
miriam
their
voices
rather
were
necessary
for
the
success
of
the
clergyman
mysterious
experiments
only
while
miriam
little
witch
knew
all
about
it
he
candidate
on
trial
knew
as
yet
nothing
and
now
as
they
sat
opposite
one
another
in
the
privacy
of
the
library
spinrobin
full
of
confidence
and
for
once
proud
of
his
name
and
personality
looked
forward
to
being
taken
more
into
the
heart
of
the
affair
things
advanced
however
more
slowly
than
he
desired
skale
scheme
was
too
big
to
be
hurried
the
clergyman
did
not
smoke
but
his
companion
with
the
other
ready
permission
puffed
gently
at
a
small
cigarette
short
rapid
puffs
he
took
as
though
the
smoke
was
afraid
to
enter
beyond
the
front
teeth
and
with
one
finger
he
incessantly
knocked
off
the
ashes
into
his
saucer
even
when
none
were
there
to
fall
on
the
table
behind
them
gurgled
the
shaded
lamp
lighting
their
faces
from
the
eyes
downwards
now
said
skale
evidently
not
aware
that
he
thundered
we
can
talk
quietly
and
undisturbed
he
caught
his
beard
in
a
capacious
hand
in
such
a
way
that
the
square
outline
of
his
chin
showed
through
the
hair
his
voice
boomed
musically
filling
the
room
spinrobin
listened
acutely
afraid
even
to
cross
his
legs
a
genuine
pronouncement
he
felt
was
coming
a
good
many
years
ago
spinrobin
he
said
simply
when
i
was
a
curate
of
a
country
parish
in
norfolk
i
made
a
discovery
of
a
revolutionary
description
a
discovery
in
the
world
of
real
things
that
is
of
spiritual
things
he
gazed
fixedly
over
the
clutched
beard
at
his
companion
apparently
searching
for
brief
intelligible
phrases
but
a
discovery
the
development
of
which
i
was
obliged
to
put
on
one
side
until
i
inherited
with
this
property
the
means
and
leisure
which
enabled
me
to
continue
my
terrific
i
say
purposely
terrific
researches
for
some
years
now
i
have
been
quietly
at
work
here
absorbed
in
my
immense
pursuit
and
again
he
stopped
i
have
reached
a
point
spinrobin
yes
interjected
the
secretary
as
though
the
mention
of
his
name
touched
a
button
and
produced
a
sound
a
point
where
i
need
the
assistance
of
some
one
with
a
definite
quality
of
voice
a
man
who
emits
a
certain
note
a
certain
tenor
note
he
released
his
beard
so
that
it
flew
out
with
a
spring
at
the
same
moment
thrusting
his
head
forward
to
drive
home
the
announcement
effectively
spinrobin
crossed
his
legs
with
a
fluttering
motion
hastily
as
you
advertised
he
suggested
the
clergyman
bowed
my
efforts
to
find
the
right
man
continued
the
enthusiast
leaning
back
in
his
chair
have
now
lasted
a
year
i
have
had
a
dozen
men
down
here
each
on
a
month
trial
none
of
them
suited
none
had
the
requisite
quality
of
voice
with
a
single
exception
none
of
them
could
stand
the
loneliness
the
seclusion
and
without
exception
all
of
them
were
too
worldly
to
make
sacrifices
it
was
the
salary
they
wanted
the
majority
moreover
confused
imagination
with
fancy
and
courage
with
mere
audacity
and
most
serious
of
all
not
one
of
them
passed
the
test
of
miriam
she
harmonized
with
none
of
them
they
were
discords
one
and
all
you
spinrobin
are
the
first
to
win
acceptance
the
instant
she
heard
your
name
she
cried
for
you
and
she
knows
she
sings
the
soprano
she
took
you
into
the
chord
i
hope
indeed
stammered
the
flustered
and
puzzled
secretary
and
then
stopped
blushing
absurdly
you
claim
for
me
far
more
than
i
should
dare
to
claim
for
myself
he
added
the
reference
to
miriam
delighted
him
and
utterly
destroyed
his
judgment
he
longed
to
thank
the
girl
for
having
approved
him
i
glad
my
voice
er
suits
your
chord
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
understood
something
of
what
skale
was
driving
at
yet
was
to
admit
it
even
to
himself
in
this
twentieth
century
it
all
seemed
so
romantic
mystical
and
absurd
he
felt
it
was
all
if
only
he
could
have
run
back
into
that
great
mental
prairie
of
his
boyhood
days
it
might
all
have
been
true
precisely
continued
skale
bringing
him
back
to
reality
precisely
and
now
before
i
tell
you
more
you
will
forgive
my
asking
you
one
or
two
personal
questions
i
sure
we
must
build
securely
as
we
go
leaving
nothing
to
chance
the
grandeur
and
importance
of
my
experiments
demand
it
afterwards
and
his
expression
changed
to
a
sudden
softness
in
a
way
that
was
characteristic
of
the
man
you
must
feel
free
to
put
similar
questions
to
me
as
personal
and
direct
as
you
please
i
wish
to
establish
a
perfect
frankness
between
us
at
the
start
thank
you
skale
of
course
er
should
anything
occur
to
me
to
ask
a
momentary
bewilderment
caused
by
the
great
visage
so
close
to
his
own
prevented
the
completion
of
the
sentence
as
to
your
beliefs
for
instance
the
clergyman
resumed
abruptly
your
religious
beliefs
i
mean
i
must
be
sure
of
you
on
that
ground
what
are
you
nothing
i
think
spinrobin
replied
without
hesitation
remembering
how
his
soul
had
bounced
its
way
among
the
various
creeds
since
cambridge
and
arrived
at
its
present
state
of
belief
in
everything
yet
without
any
definite
label
nothing
in
particular
nominally
though
a
christian
you
believe
in
a
god
a
supreme
intelligence
most
certainly
was
the
emphatic
reply
and
spirits
spinrobin
hesitated
he
was
a
very
honest
soul
other
life
let
me
put
it
the
clergyman
helped
him
other
beings
besides
ourselves
i
have
often
felt
wondered
rather
he
answered
carefully
whether
there
might
not
be
other
systems
of
evolution
besides
humanity
such
extraordinary
forces
come
blundering
into
one
life
sometimes
and
one
ca
help
wondering
where
they
come
from
i
have
never
formulated
any
definite
beliefs
however
your
world
is
not
a
blind
chaos
i
mean
skale
put
gravely
to
him
as
though
questioning
a
child
no
no
indeed
there
order
and
system
in
which
you
personally
count
for
something
of
value
asked
the
other
quickly
i
like
to
think
so
was
the
apologetic
reply
there
something
that
includes
me
somewhere
in
a
purpose
of
very
great
importance
only
of
course
i
got
to
do
my
part
and
good
skale
interrupted
him
and
now
he
asked
softly
after
a
moment
pause
leaning
forward
what
about
death
are
you
afraid
of
death
spinrobin
started
visibly
he
began
to
wonder
where
this
extraordinary
catechism
was
going
to
lead
but
he
answered
at
once
he
had
thought
out
these
things
and
knew
where
he
stood
only
of
its
possible
pain
he
said
smiling
into
the
bearded
visage
before
him
and
an
immense
curiosity
of
course
it
does
not
mean
extinction
for
you
going
out
like
the
flame
of
a
candle
for
instance
i
have
never
been
able
to
believe
skale
i
continue
somewhere
and
somehow
forever
the
puzzled
him
more
and
more
and
through
it
for
the
first
time
he
began
to
feel
dimly
ran
a
certain
strain
of
something
not
quite
right
not
permissible
in
the
biggest
sense
it
was
not
the
questions
themselves
that
produced
this
odd
and
rather
disquieting
impression
but
the
fact
that
skale
was
preparing
the
ground
with
such
extraordinary
thoroughness
this
conversation
was
the
first
swell
as
it
were
rolling
mysteriously
in
upon
him
from
the
ocean
in
whose
deeps
the
great
experiment
lay
buried
forces
tidal
in
strength
oceanic
in
volume
shrouded
it
just
now
but
he
already
felt
them
they
reached
him
through
the
person
of
the
clergyman
it
was
these
forces
playing
through
his
personality
that
spinrobin
had
been
aware
of
the
first
moment
they
met
on
the
station
platform
and
had
sensed
even
more
strongly
during
the
walk
home
across
the
mountains
behind
the
play
of
these
darker
impressions
as
yet
only
vague
and
ambiguous
there
ran
in
and
out
among
his
thoughts
the
vein
of
something
much
sweeter
miriam
with
her
large
grey
eyes
and
silvery
voice
was
continually
peeping
in
upon
his
mind
he
wondered
where
she
was
and
what
she
was
doing
in
the
big
lonely
house
he
wished
she
could
have
been
in
the
room
to
hear
his
answers
and
approve
them
he
felt
incomplete
without
her
already
he
thought
of
her
as
the
melody
to
which
he
was
the
accompaniment
two
things
that
ought
not
to
be
separated
my
point
is
skale
continued
that
apart
from
ordinary
human
ties
and
so
forth
you
have
no
intrinsic
terror
of
death
of
losing
your
present
body
no
no
was
the
reply
more
faintly
given
than
the
rest
i
love
my
life
but
but
he
looked
about
him
in
some
confusion
for
the
right
words
still
thinking
of
miriam
but
i
look
forward
skale
i
look
forward
he
dropped
back
into
the
depths
of
his
armchair
and
puffed
swiftly
at
the
end
of
his
extinguished
cigarette
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
no
smoke
came
the
attitude
of
a
brave
man
said
the
clergyman
with
approval
then
looking
straight
into
the
secretary
blue
eyes
he
added
with
increased
gravity
and
therefore
it
would
not
be
immoral
of
me
to
expose
you
to
an
experiment
in
which
the
penalty
of
a
slip
would
be
death
or
you
would
not
shrink
from
it
yourself
provided
the
knowledge
to
be
obtained
seemed
worth
while
that
right
sir
skale
i
mean
that
right
came
the
answer
after
an
imperceptible
pause
the
result
of
the
talk
seemed
to
satisfy
the
clergyman
you
must
think
my
questions
peculiar
he
said
the
sternness
of
his
face
relaxing
a
little
but
it
was
necessary
to
understand
your
exact
position
before
proceeding
further
the
gravity
of
my
undertaking
demands
it
however
you
must
not
let
my
words
alarm
you
he
waited
a
moment
reflecting
deeply
you
must
regard
them
if
you
will
as
a
kind
of
test
he
resumed
searching
his
companion
face
with
eagle
eyes
the
beginning
of
a
series
of
tests
in
which
your
attitude
to
miriam
and
hers
to
you
so
far
as
that
goes
was
the
first
oh
that
all
right
skale
was
his
inadequate
rejoinder
for
the
moment
the
name
of
the
girl
was
introduced
his
thoughts
instantly
wandered
out
to
find
her
the
way
the
clergyman
pronounced
it
increased
its
power
too
for
no
name
he
uttered
sounded
ordinary
there
seemed
a
curious
mingling
in
the
resonant
cavity
of
his
great
mouth
of
the
fundamental
note
and
the
overtones
yes
you
have
the
kind
of
courage
that
is
necessary
skale
was
saying
half
to
himself
the
modesty
that
forgets
self
and
the
unworldly
attitude
that
is
essential
with
your
help
i
may
encompass
success
and
i
consider
myself
wonderfully
fortunate
to
have
found
you
wonderfully
fortunate
i
glad
murmured
spinrobin
thinking
that
so
far
he
had
not
learned
anything
very
definite
about
his
duties
or
what
it
was
he
had
to
do
to
earn
so
substantial
a
salary
truth
to
tell
he
did
not
bother
much
about
that
part
of
it
he
was
conscious
only
of
three
main
desires
to
pass
the
unknown
tests
to
learn
the
nature
of
skale
discovery
with
the
experiment
involved
and
to
be
with
miriam
as
much
as
possible
the
whole
affair
was
so
unusual
that
he
had
already
lost
the
common
standards
of
judging
he
let
the
sliding
platform
take
him
where
it
would
and
he
flattered
himself
that
he
was
not
fool
enough
to
mistake
originality
for
insanity
the
clergyman
dreamer
and
enthusiast
though
he
might
be
was
as
sane
as
other
men
saner
than
most
i
hope
to
lead
you
little
by
little
to
what
i
have
in
view
skale
went
on
so
that
at
the
end
of
our
trial
month
you
will
have
learned
enough
to
enable
you
to
form
a
decision
yet
not
enough
to
to
use
my
knowledge
should
you
choose
to
return
to
the
world
it
was
very
frank
but
the
secretary
did
not
feel
offended
he
accepted
the
explanation
as
perfectly
reasonable
in
his
mind
he
knew
full
well
what
his
choice
would
be
this
was
the
supreme
adventure
he
had
been
so
long
no
ordinary
obstacle
could
prevent
his
accepting
it
ii
there
came
a
pause
of
some
length
in
which
spinrobin
found
nothing
particular
to
say
the
lamp
gurgled
the
coals
fell
softly
into
the
fender
then
suddenly
skale
rose
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
grate
he
gazed
down
upon
the
small
figure
in
the
chair
he
towered
there
a
kindly
giant
enthusiasm
burning
in
his
eyes
like
lamps
his
voice
was
very
deep
his
manner
more
solemn
than
before
when
he
spoke
so
far
so
good
he
said
and
now
with
your
permission
spinrobin
i
should
like
to
go
a
step
further
i
should
like
to
take
your
note
my
note
exclaimed
the
other
thinking
he
had
not
heard
correctly
your
sound
yes
repeated
the
clergyman
my
sound
piped
the
little
man
vastly
puzzled
his
voice
shrill
with
excitement
he
dodged
about
in
the
depths
of
his
big
leather
chair
as
though
movement
might
bring
explanation
skale
watched
him
calmly
i
want
to
get
the
vibrations
of
your
voice
and
then
see
what
pattern
they
produce
in
the
sand
he
said
oh
in
the
sand
yes
quite
so
replied
the
secretary
he
remembered
how
the
vibrations
of
an
elastic
membrane
can
throw
dry
sand
loosely
scattered
upon
its
surface
into
various
floral
and
geometrical
figures
chladni
figures
he
seemed
to
remember
they
were
called
after
their
discoverer
but
skale
purpose
in
the
main
of
course
escaped
him
you
do
object
on
the
contrary
i
am
greatly
interested
he
stood
up
on
the
mat
beside
his
employer
i
wish
to
make
sure
the
clergyman
added
gravely
that
your
voice
your
note
is
what
i
think
it
is
accurately
in
harmony
with
mine
and
miriam
and
mawle
the
pattern
it
makes
will
help
to
prove
this
the
secretary
bowed
in
perplexed
silence
while
skale
crossed
the
room
and
took
a
violin
from
its
case
the
golden
varnish
of
its
ribs
and
back
gleamed
in
the
lamplight
and
when
the
clergyman
drew
the
bow
across
the
strings
to
tune
it
smooth
mellow
sounds
soft
and
resonant
as
bells
filled
the
room
evidently
he
knew
how
to
handle
the
instrument
the
notes
died
away
in
a
murmur
a
guarnerius
he
explained
and
a
perfect
pedigree
specimen
it
has
the
most
sensitive
structure
imaginable
and
carries
vibrations
almost
like
a
human
nerve
for
instance
while
i
speak
he
added
laying
the
violin
upon
his
companion
hand
you
will
feel
the
vibrations
of
my
voice
run
through
the
wood
into
your
palm
i
do
said
spinrobin
it
trembled
like
a
living
thing
now
continued
skale
after
a
pause
what
i
first
want
is
to
receive
the
vibrations
of
your
own
voice
in
the
same
way
into
my
very
pulses
kindly
read
aloud
steadily
while
i
hold
it
stop
reading
when
i
make
a
sign
i
nod
so
that
the
vibrations
of
my
voice
interfere
and
he
handed
a
notebook
to
him
with
quotations
entered
neatly
in
his
own
handwriting
selected
evidently
with
a
purpose
and
all
dealing
with
sound
music
as
organized
sound
and
names
spinrobin
read
aloud
the
first
quotation
from
meredith
he
recognized
but
the
others
and
the
last
one
discussing
names
were
new
to
him
but
in
the
so
may
there
come
conception
of
a
chord
commanding
space
beyond
where
ear
has
home
everything
that
the
sun
shines
upon
sings
or
can
be
made
to
sing
and
can
be
heard
to
sing
gases
impalpable
powders
and
woolen
stuffs
in
common
with
other
of
sound
give
forth
notes
of
different
pitches
when
played
upon
by
an
intermittent
beam
of
white
light
colored
stuffs
will
sing
in
lights
of
different
colors
but
refuse
to
sing
in
others
the
polarization
of
light
being
now
accomplished
light
and
sound
are
known
to
be
alike
flames
have
a
modulated
voice
and
can
be
made
to
sing
a
definite
melody
wood
stone
metal
skins
fibers
membranes
every
rapidly
vibrating
substance
have
in
them
the
potentialities
of
musical
radium
receives
its
energy
from
and
responds
to
radiations
which
traverse
all
space
as
piano
strings
respond
to
sounds
in
unison
with
their
notes
space
is
all
with
waves
of
radiant
energy
we
vibrate
in
sympathy
with
a
few
strings
here
and
there
with
the
tiny
actinic
rays
light
waves
heat
waves
and
the
huge
electromagnetic
waves
of
hertz
and
marconi
but
there
are
great
spaces
numberless
radiations
to
which
we
are
stone
deaf
some
day
a
thousand
years
hence
we
shall
know
the
full
sweep
of
this
magnificent
harmony
everything
in
nature
has
its
name
and
he
who
has
the
power
to
call
a
thing
by
its
proper
name
can
make
it
subservient
to
his
will
for
its
proper
name
is
not
the
arbitrary
name
given
to
it
by
man
but
the
expression
of
the
totality
of
its
powers
and
attributes
because
the
powers
and
attributes
of
each
being
are
intimately
connected
with
its
means
of
expression
and
between
both
exists
the
most
exact
proportion
in
regard
to
measure
time
and
condition
the
meaning
of
the
four
quotations
as
he
read
them
plunged
down
into
him
and
touched
inner
chords
very
close
to
his
own
beliefs
something
of
his
own
soul
therefore
passed
into
his
voice
as
he
read
he
read
that
is
to
say
with
authority
a
nod
from
skale
stopped
him
just
as
he
was
beginning
a
fifth
passage
raising
the
vibrating
instrument
to
his
ear
the
clergyman
first
listened
a
moment
intently
then
he
quickly
had
it
under
his
chin
beard
flowing
over
it
like
water
and
the
bow
singing
across
the
strings
the
note
he
played
he
drew
it
out
with
that
whipping
motion
of
the
bow
only
possible
to
a
loving
expert
was
soft
and
beautiful
long
drawn
out
with
a
sweet
singing
quality
he
took
it
on
the
g
string
with
the
second
finger
in
the
fourth
position
it
thrilled
through
him
spinrobin
declares
most
curiously
and
delightfully
it
made
him
happy
to
hear
it
it
was
very
similar
to
the
singing
vibrations
he
had
experienced
when
miriam
gazed
into
his
eyes
and
spoke
his
name
thank
you
said
skale
and
laid
the
violin
down
again
i
got
the
note
you
e
flat
e
flat
gasped
spinrobin
not
sure
whether
he
was
pleased
or
disappointed
that
your
sound
yes
you
e
flat
just
as
i
thought
just
as
i
hoped
you
fit
in
exactly
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
his
voice
began
to
boom
again
as
it
always
did
when
he
was
moved
he
was
striding
about
very
alert
very
masterful
pushing
the
furniture
out
of
his
way
his
eyes
more
luminous
than
ever
it
magnificent
he
stopped
abruptly
and
looked
at
the
secretary
with
a
gaze
so
enveloping
that
spinrobin
for
an
instant
lost
his
bearings
altogether
it
means
my
dear
spinrobin
he
said
slowly
with
a
touch
of
solemnity
that
woke
an
involuntary
shiver
deep
in
his
listener
being
that
you
are
destined
to
play
a
part
and
an
important
part
in
one
of
the
grandest
experiments
ever
dreamed
of
by
the
heart
of
man
for
the
first
time
since
my
researches
began
twenty
years
ago
i
now
see
the
end
in
sight
skale
that
something
indeed
was
all
the
little
man
could
find
to
say
there
was
no
reason
he
could
point
to
why
the
words
should
have
produced
a
sense
of
chill
about
his
heart
it
was
only
that
he
felt
again
the
huge
groundswell
of
this
vast
unknown
experiment
surging
against
him
lifting
him
from
his
feet
as
a
man
might
feel
the
atlantic
swells
rise
with
him
towards
the
stars
before
they
engulfed
him
forever
it
seemed
getting
a
trifle
out
of
hand
this
adventure
yet
it
was
what
he
had
always
longed
for
and
his
courage
must
hold
firm
besides
miriam
was
involved
in
it
with
him
what
could
he
ask
better
than
to
risk
his
insignificant
personality
in
some
gigantic
mad
attempt
to
plumb
the
unknown
with
that
slender
little
beauty
by
his
side
the
wave
of
enthusiasm
swept
him
away
deliciously
and
now
he
cried
we
get
your
pattern
too
i
no
longer
have
any
doubts
but
none
the
less
it
will
be
a
satisfaction
to
us
both
to
see
it
it
must
i
sure
harmonize
with
ours
it
must
he
opened
a
cupboard
drawer
and
produced
a
thin
sheet
of
glass
upon
which
he
next
poured
some
finely
powdered
sand
out
of
a
paper
bag
it
rattled
dry
and
faint
upon
the
smooth
hard
surface
and
while
he
did
this
he
talked
rapidly
boomingly
with
immense
enthusiasm
all
sounds
he
said
half
to
himself
half
to
the
astonished
secretary
create
their
own
patterns
sound
builds
sound
destroys
and
invisible
affect
concrete
matter
for
all
sounds
produce
forms
the
forms
that
correspond
to
them
as
you
shall
now
see
within
every
form
lies
the
silent
sound
that
first
called
it
into
view
into
visible
shape
into
being
forms
shapes
bodies
are
the
vibratory
activities
of
made
my
goodness
exclaimed
spinrobin
who
was
listening
like
a
man
in
a
dream
but
who
caught
the
violence
of
the
clergyman
idea
none
the
less
forms
and
bodies
are
cried
the
clergyman
in
italics
you
say
something
extraordinary
exclaimed
the
commonplace
spinrobin
in
his
shrill
voice
marvelous
vaguely
he
seemed
to
remember
that
schelling
had
called
architecture
frozen
music
skale
turned
and
looked
at
him
as
a
god
might
look
at
an
insect
that
he
loved
sound
spinrobin
he
said
with
a
sudden
and
effective
lowering
of
his
booming
voice
is
the
original
divine
impulsion
behind
nature
communicated
to
language
it
is
creative
then
leaving
the
secretary
with
this
nut
of
condensed
knowledge
to
crack
as
best
he
could
the
clergyman
went
to
the
end
of
the
room
in
three
strides
he
busied
himself
for
a
moment
with
something
upon
the
wall
then
he
suddenly
turned
his
great
face
aglow
his
huge
form
erect
fixing
his
burning
eyes
upon
his
distracted
companion
in
the
beginning
he
boomed
solemnly
in
tones
of
profound
conviction
was
the
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
continued
his
voice
filling
the
room
to
the
very
ceiling
at
the
word
of
god
at
the
thunder
of
the
voice
of
god
worlds
leaped
into
being
again
he
paused
sound
he
went
on
the
whole
force
of
his
great
personality
in
the
phrase
was
the
primordial
creative
energy
a
sound
can
call
a
form
into
existence
forms
are
the
of
archetypal
forces
the
word
made
flesh
he
stopped
and
moved
with
great
soft
strides
about
the
room
spinrobin
caught
the
words
full
in
the
face
for
a
space
he
could
not
measure
considerably
less
than
a
second
probably
the
consciousness
of
something
unutterably
immense
unutterably
flaming
rushed
tumultuously
through
his
mind
with
wings
that
bore
his
imagination
to
a
place
where
light
was
dazzling
white
beyond
words
he
felt
himself
tossed
up
to
heaven
on
the
waves
of
a
great
sea
as
the
body
of
strange
belief
behind
the
clergyman
words
poured
through
him
for
somewhere
behind
the
incoherence
of
the
passionate
language
burned
the
blaze
of
a
true
thought
at
white
heat
could
he
but
grasp
it
through
the
stammering
utterance
then
with
equal
swiftness
it
passed
his
present
surroundings
came
back
he
dropped
with
a
dizzy
rush
from
awful
spaces
and
was
aware
that
he
was
merely
standing
on
the
black
woolly
mat
before
the
fire
watching
the
movements
of
his
new
employer
that
his
pumps
were
bright
and
pointed
his
head
just
level
with
a
dark
marble
mantelpiece
dazed
and
a
trifle
breathless
he
felt
and
at
the
back
of
his
disordered
mind
stirred
a
schoolboy
memory
that
the
pythagoreans
believed
the
universe
to
have
been
called
out
of
chaos
by
sound
number
and
harmony
or
something
to
that
effect
but
these
huge
fugitive
thoughts
that
tore
through
him
refused
to
be
seized
and
dealt
with
he
staggered
a
little
mentally
then
with
a
prodigious
effort
controlled
himself
and
watched
iii
skale
he
saw
had
fastened
the
little
sheet
of
glass
by
its
four
corners
to
silken
strings
hanging
from
the
ceiling
the
glass
plate
hung
motionless
and
horizontal
in
the
air
with
its
freight
of
sand
for
several
minutes
the
clergyman
played
a
series
of
beautiful
modulations
in
upon
the
violin
in
these
the
dominating
influence
was
e
flat
spinrobin
was
not
musical
enough
to
describe
it
more
accurately
than
this
only
with
greater
skill
than
he
knows
he
mentions
how
skale
drew
out
of
that
fiddle
the
peculiarly
intimate
and
searching
tones
by
which
strings
can
reach
the
spiritual
center
of
a
man
and
make
him
respond
to
delicate
vibrations
of
thoughts
beyond
his
normal
gamut
spinrobin
listening
understood
that
he
was
a
greater
man
than
he
knew
and
the
sand
on
the
glass
sheet
he
next
became
aware
was
shifting
moving
dancing
he
heard
the
tiny
hissing
and
rattling
of
the
dry
grains
it
was
uncommonly
weird
this
visible
and
practical
result
made
the
clergyman
astonishing
words
seem
true
and
convincing
that
moving
sand
brought
sanity
yet
a
certain
curious
terror
of
the
unknown
into
it
all
a
minute
later
skale
stopped
playing
and
beckoned
to
him
see
he
said
quietly
pointing
to
the
arrangement
the
particles
of
sand
had
assumed
under
the
influence
of
the
vibrations
there
your
pattern
your
sound
made
visible
that
your
utterance
the
note
you
substantially
represent
and
body
forth
in
terms
of
matter
the
secretary
stared
it
was
a
charming
but
very
simple
pattern
the
lines
of
sand
had
assumed
not
unlike
the
fronds
of
a
delicate
fern
growing
out
of
several
small
circles
round
the
base
so
that
my
note
made
visible
he
exclaimed
under
his
breath
delightful
it
quite
exquisite
that
e
flat
returned
skale
in
a
whisper
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
pattern
if
i
altered
the
note
the
pattern
would
alter
too
e
natural
for
instance
would
be
different
only
luckily
you
are
e
flat
just
the
note
we
want
and
now
he
continued
straightening
himself
up
to
his
full
height
come
over
and
see
mine
and
miriam
and
mawle
and
you
understand
what
i
meant
when
i
said
that
yours
would
harmonize
and
in
a
glass
case
across
the
room
they
examined
a
number
of
square
sheets
of
glass
with
sand
upon
them
in
various
patterns
all
rendered
permanent
by
a
thin
coating
of
a
transparent
substance
that
held
the
particles
in
position
there
you
see
mine
and
miriam
and
mawle
he
said
stooping
to
look
they
harmonize
most
beautifully
you
observe
with
your
own
it
was
indeed
a
singular
and
remarkable
thing
the
patterns
though
all
different
yet
combined
in
some
subtle
fashion
impossible
of
analysis
to
form
a
complete
and
whole
a
design
a
picture
the
patterns
of
the
clergyman
and
the
housekeeper
provided
the
base
and
foreground
those
of
miriam
and
the
secretary
the
delicate
superstructure
the
girl
pattern
he
noted
with
a
subtle
pleasure
was
curiously
similar
to
his
own
but
far
more
delicate
and
waving
yet
whereas
his
was
floral
hers
was
stellar
in
character
that
of
the
housekeeper
was
spiral
and
skale
he
could
only
describe
as
a
miniature
whirlwind
of
very
exquisite
design
rising
out
of
apparently
three
separate
centers
of
motion
if
i
could
paint
over
them
the
color
each
shade
of
sound
represents
skale
resumed
the
tint
of
each
or
as
the
germans
call
it
you
would
see
better
still
how
we
are
all
grouped
together
there
into
a
complete
and
harmonious
whole
spinrobin
looked
from
the
patterns
to
his
companion
great
face
bending
there
beside
him
then
he
looked
back
again
at
the
patterns
he
could
think
of
nothing
quite
intelligible
to
say
he
noticed
more
clearly
every
minute
that
these
dainty
shapes
of
sand
stellar
spiral
and
floral
stood
to
one
another
in
certain
definite
proportions
in
a
rising
and
calculated
ratio
of
singular
beauty
there
before
you
lies
a
true
and
perfect
chord
made
visible
the
clergyman
said
in
tones
thrilling
with
satisfaction
three
notes
in
harmony
with
the
fundamental
sound
myself
and
with
each
other
my
dear
fellow
i
congratulate
you
i
congratulate
you
thank
you
very
much
indeed
murmured
spinrobin
i
do
quite
understand
it
all
yet
but
it
it
extraordinarily
fascinating
and
wonderful
skale
said
nothing
and
spinrobin
drifted
back
to
his
big
armchair
a
deep
silence
pervaded
the
room
for
the
space
of
several
minutes
in
the
heart
of
that
silence
lay
the
mass
of
direct
and
vital
questions
the
secretary
burned
yet
was
afraid
to
ask
for
such
was
the
plain
truth
he
yearned
to
know
yet
feared
to
hear
the
discovery
and
the
experiment
of
this
singular
man
loomed
already
somewhat
vast
and
terrible
the
adjective
that
had
suggested
itself
before
returned
to
him
not
permissible
of
skale
himself
he
had
no
sort
of
fear
though
a
growing
and
uncommon
respect
but
of
the
purpose
skale
had
in
view
he
caught
himself
thinking
more
and
more
yet
without
obvious
reason
with
a
distinct
shrinking
almost
amounting
to
dismay
but
for
the
fact
that
so
sweet
and
gentle
a
creature
as
miriam
was
traveling
the
same
path
with
him
this
increased
sense
of
caution
would
have
revealed
itself
plainly
for
what
it
was
fear
i
am
deeply
interested
skale
he
said
at
length
breaking
first
the
silence
and
sympathetic
too
i
assure
you
only
you
will
forgive
me
for
saying
it
i
am
as
yet
still
rather
in
the
dark
as
to
where
all
this
is
to
lead
the
clergyman
eyes
fixed
straight
upon
his
own
again
made
it
difficult
to
finish
the
sentence
as
he
wished
necessarily
so
because
i
can
only
lead
you
to
my
discovery
step
by
step
replied
the
other
steadily
i
wish
you
to
be
thoroughly
prepared
for
anything
that
may
happen
so
that
you
can
deal
intelligently
with
results
that
might
otherwise
overwhelm
you
overwhelm
faltered
his
listener
i
said
note
carefully
my
use
of
words
for
they
are
accurately
chosen
before
i
can
tell
you
all
i
must
submit
you
for
your
own
sake
to
certain
tests
chiefly
to
the
test
of
alteration
of
form
by
sound
it
is
somewhat
er
alarming
i
believe
the
first
time
you
must
be
thoroughly
accustomed
to
these
astonishing
results
before
we
dare
to
approach
the
final
experiment
so
that
you
will
not
tremble
for
there
can
be
no
rehearsal
the
great
experiment
can
only
be
made
once
and
i
must
be
as
sure
as
possible
that
you
will
feel
no
terror
in
the
face
of
the
unknown
iv
spinrobin
listened
breathlessly
he
hesitated
a
moment
after
the
other
stopped
speaking
then
slewed
round
on
his
slippery
chair
and
faced
him
i
can
understand
he
began
why
you
want
imagination
but
you
spoke
of
courage
too
i
mean
is
there
any
immediate
cause
for
alarm
any
personal
danger
for
instance
for
the
clergyman
weighty
sentences
had
made
him
realize
in
a
new
sense
the
loneliness
of
his
situation
here
among
these
desolate
hills
he
would
appreciate
some
assurance
that
his
life
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
before
he
lost
the
power
to
withdraw
if
he
wished
to
do
so
none
whatever
replied
skale
with
decision
there
is
no
question
at
all
of
physical
personal
injury
you
must
trust
me
and
have
a
little
patience
his
tone
and
manner
were
exceedingly
grave
yet
at
the
same
time
inspired
confidence
i
do
said
spinrobin
honestly
another
pause
fell
between
them
longer
than
the
rest
it
was
broken
by
the
clergyman
he
spoke
emphatically
evidently
weighing
his
words
with
the
utmost
care
this
chord
he
said
simply
yet
for
all
the
simplicity
there
ran
to
and
fro
behind
his
words
the
sense
of
unlawful
and
immense
forces
impending
i
need
for
a
stupendous
experiment
with
sound
an
experiment
which
will
lead
in
turn
towards
a
yet
greater
and
final
one
there
is
no
harm
in
your
knowing
that
to
produce
a
certain
transcendent
result
i
want
a
complex
sound
a
chord
but
a
complete
and
perfect
chord
in
which
each
note
is
sure
of
itself
and
absolutely
accurate
he
waited
a
moment
there
was
utter
silence
about
them
in
the
room
spinrobin
held
his
breath
no
instrument
can
help
me
the
notes
must
be
human
he
resumed
in
a
lower
voice
and
the
utterers
pure
for
the
human
voice
can
produce
sounds
in
some
degree
the
characteristics
not
only
of
all
musical
instruments
but
of
all
sounds
of
whatever
description
by
means
of
this
chord
i
hope
to
utter
a
certain
sound
a
certain
of
which
you
shall
know
more
hereafter
but
a
name
as
you
surely
know
need
not
be
composed
of
one
or
two
syllables
only
a
whole
symphony
may
be
a
name
and
a
whole
orchestra
playing
for
days
or
an
entire
nation
chanting
for
years
may
be
required
to
pronounce
the
beginning
merely
of
of
certain
names
yours
robert
spinrobin
for
instance
i
can
pronounce
in
a
quarter
of
a
second
but
there
may
be
names
so
vast
so
mighty
that
minutes
days
years
even
may
be
necessary
for
their
full
utterance
there
may
be
names
indeed
which
can
never
be
known
for
they
could
never
be
uttered
for
the
moment
i
am
content
simply
to
drop
this
thought
into
your
consciousness
later
you
shall
understand
more
i
only
wish
you
to
take
in
now
that
i
need
this
perfect
chord
for
the
utterance
in
due
course
of
a
certain
complex
and
stupendous
name
the
invocation
that
is
of
a
certain
complex
and
stupendous
force
i
think
i
understand
whispered
the
other
afraid
to
interrupt
more
and
the
difficulty
i
have
experienced
in
finding
the
three
notes
has
been
immense
i
found
mawle
alto
then
miriam
i
found
at
birth
and
trained
her
soprano
and
now
i
have
found
you
spinrobin
and
my
chord
with
myself
as
bass
is
complete
your
note
and
miriam
soprano
and
tenor
are
closer
than
the
relations
between
the
other
notes
and
a
tenor
has
accordingly
been
most
difficult
to
find
you
can
now
understand
the
importance
of
your
being
sympathetic
to
each
other
spinrobin
heart
burned
within
him
as
he
listened
he
began
to
grasp
some
sweet
mystical
meaning
in
the
sense
of
perfect
companionship
the
mere
presence
of
the
girl
inspired
they
were
the
upper
notes
in
the
same
chord
together
linked
in
a
singing
and
harmonious
relation
the
one
necessary
to
the
other
moreover
in
the
presence
of
skale
and
the
housekeeper
bass
and
alto
in
the
full
chord
their
completeness
was
still
more
emphasized
and
they
knew
their
fullest
life
the
adventure
promised
to
be
amazingly
seductive
he
would
learn
practically
the
strange
truth
that
to
know
the
highest
life
self
must
be
lost
and
merged
in
something
bigger
and
was
this
not
precisely
what
he
had
so
long
been
seeking
escape
from
his
own
insignificance
and
er
the
hebrew
that
you
require
of
me
mr
skale
he
asked
returning
to
practical
considerations
our
purposes
require
a
certain
knowledge
of
hebrew
he
answered
without
hesitation
or
demur
because
that
ancient
language
and
the
magical
resources
of
sound
are
profoundly
linked
in
the
actual
sounds
of
many
of
the
hebrew
letters
lies
a
singular
power
unguessed
by
the
majority
undivined
especially
of
course
by
the
mere
scholar
but
available
for
the
pure
in
heart
who
may
discover
how
to
use
their
extraordinary
values
they
constitute
in
my
view
at
least
a
remnant
of
the
original
chaldaean
mysteries
the
lore
of
that
magic
which
is
older
than
religion
the
secret
of
this
knowledge
lies
in
the
values
of
for
hebrew
the
hebrew
of
the
bahir
remains
in
the
hierarchy
of
languages
a
direct
channel
to
the
unknown
and
inscrutable
forces
and
the
knowledge
of
mighty
and
supersensual
things
lies
locked
up
in
the
correct
utterance
of
many
of
its
words
letters
and
phrases
its
correct
utterance
mark
well
for
knowledge
of
the
most
amazing
and
terrible
kind
is
there
waiting
release
by
him
who
knows
and
who
greatly
dares
and
you
shall
later
learn
that
sound
is
power
the
hebrew
alphabet
you
must
know
intimately
and
the
intricate
association
of
its
letters
with
number
color
harmony
and
geometrical
form
all
of
which
are
but
symbols
of
the
realities
at
the
very
roots
of
life
the
hebrew
alphabet
spinrobin
is
a
in
methods
of
manifestation
of
formation
in
its
correct
pronunciation
lies
a
way
to
direct
knowledge
of
divine
powers
and
to
conditions
beyond
this
physical
existence
the
clergyman
voice
grew
lower
and
lower
as
he
proceeded
and
the
conviction
was
unavoidable
that
he
referred
to
things
whereof
he
had
practical
knowledge
to
spinrobin
it
was
like
the
lifting
of
a
great
veil
as
a
boy
he
had
divined
something
of
these
values
of
sound
and
name
but
with
the
years
this
knowledge
had
come
to
seem
fantastic
and
unreal
it
now
returned
upon
him
with
the
force
of
a
terrific
certainty
that
immense
old
inner
playground
of
his
youth
without
boundaries
or
horizon
rolled
up
before
his
mental
vision
inviting
further
and
detailed
discovery
with
the
language
qua
language
he
continued
you
need
not
trouble
but
the
of
many
things
you
must
know
accurately
and
especially
the
names
of
the
for
these
are
in
reality
forces
of
immense
potency
vast
spiritual
powers
qualities
and
the
like
all
evocable
by
correct
utterance
of
their
names
this
language
as
you
will
see
is
and
divine
in
the
true
sense
its
letters
are
the
vehicles
of
activities
its
words
terrific
formulae
and
the
true
pronunciation
of
them
remains
today
a
direct
channel
to
divine
knowledge
in
time
you
shall
see
in
time
you
shall
know
in
time
you
shall
hear
spinrobin
and
he
thrust
his
great
head
forwards
and
dropped
his
voice
to
a
hushed
whisper
in
time
we
shall
all
together
make
this
experiment
in
sound
which
shall
redeem
us
and
make
us
as
gods
thank
you
gasped
the
secretary
swept
off
his
feet
by
this
torrent
of
uncommon
and
mystical
language
and
passing
a
moist
hand
through
his
feathery
hair
he
was
not
entirely
ignorant
of
course
of
the
alleged
use
of
sound
in
the
various
systems
of
magic
that
have
influenced
the
minds
of
imaginative
men
during
the
history
of
the
world
he
had
heard
more
or
less
vaguely
perhaps
but
still
with
understanding
about
words
of
power
but
hitherto
he
had
merely
regarded
such
things
as
picturesque
superstitions
or
that
lie
midway
between
science
and
imagination
here
however
was
a
man
in
the
twentieth
century
the
days
of
radium
flying
machines
wireless
telegraphy
and
other
invitations
towards
materialism
who
apparently
had
practical
belief
in
the
effective
use
of
sound
and
in
its
psychic
and
divine
possibilities
and
who
was
devoting
all
of
his
not
inconsiderable
powers
of
heart
and
mind
to
their
actual
demonstration
it
was
astonishing
it
was
delightful
it
was
incredible
and
but
for
the
currents
of
a
strange
and
formidable
fear
that
this
conception
of
audacious
experiment
set
stirring
in
his
soul
spinrobin
enthusiasm
would
have
been
possibly
as
great
as
his
own
as
it
was
he
went
up
to
the
big
clergyman
and
held
out
his
hand
utterly
carried
away
by
the
strangeness
of
it
all
caught
up
in
a
vague
splendor
he
did
not
quite
understand
prepared
to
abandon
himself
utterly
i
gather
something
of
what
you
mean
he
said
earnestly
if
not
all
and
i
hope
most
sincerely
i
may
prove
suitable
for
your
purpose
when
the
time
comes
as
a
boy
you
know
curiously
enough
i
always
believed
in
the
efficacy
of
names
and
the
importance
of
naming
true
i
think
he
added
somewhat
diffidently
looking
up
straight
into
the
luminous
eyes
above
him
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
i
would
follow
you
anywhere
skale
anywhere
you
cared
to
lead
him
that
overcometh
said
the
clergyman
in
that
gentle
voice
he
sometimes
used
soft
as
the
voice
of
woman
i
write
my
new
name
he
gazed
down
very
searchingly
into
the
other
eyes
for
a
minute
or
two
then
shook
the
proffered
hand
without
another
word
and
so
they
separated
and
went
to
bed
for
it
was
long
past
midnight
chapter
iii
i
in
his
bedroom
though
excitement
banished
sleep
in
spite
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
he
was
too
exhausted
to
make
any
effective
attempt
to
reduce
the
confusion
of
his
mind
to
order
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
for
the
day
remained
blank
for
a
long
time
he
sat
before
it
with
his
pencil
then
sighed
and
put
it
away
a
volume
he
might
have
written
but
not
a
page
much
less
a
line
or
two
and
though
it
was
but
eight
hours
since
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
rev
philip
skale
it
seemed
to
him
more
like
eight
days
moreover
all
that
he
had
heard
and
seen
fantastic
and
strained
as
he
felt
it
to
be
possibly
even
the
product
of
religious
mania
was
nevertheless
profoundly
disquieting
for
mixed
up
with
it
somewhere
or
other
was
truth
skale
made
a
discovery
a
giant
one
it
was
not
all
merely
talk
and
hypnotism
the
glamour
of
words
his
great
experiment
would
prove
to
be
real
and
terrible
he
discovered
certain
uses
of
sound
occult
yet
scientific
and
if
he
spinrobin
elected
to
stay
on
he
would
be
obliged
to
play
his
part
in
the
dénouement
and
this
thought
from
the
very
beginning
appalled
while
it
fascinated
him
it
filled
him
with
a
kind
of
horrible
amazement
for
the
object
the
clergyman
sought
though
not
yet
disclosed
already
cast
its
monstrous
shadow
across
his
path
he
somehow
discerned
that
it
would
deal
directly
with
knowledge
the
saner
judgment
of
a
commonplace
world
had
always
deemed
undesirable
unlawful
unsafe
dangerous
to
the
souls
that
dared
attempt
it
failure
involving
a
pitiless
and
terrible
nemesis
he
lay
in
bed
watching
the
play
of
the
firelight
upon
the
high
ceiling
and
thinking
in
confused
fashion
of
the
huge
clergyman
with
his
thundering
voice
his
great
lambent
eyes
and
his
seductive
gentleness
of
his
singular
speculations
and
his
hints
half
menacing
half
splendid
of
things
to
come
then
he
thought
of
the
housekeeper
with
her
deafness
and
her
withered
arm
and
that
white
peace
about
her
face
and
lastly
of
miriam
soft
pale
beneath
her
dark
skin
her
eyes
ever
finding
his
own
and
of
the
intimate
personal
relations
so
swiftly
established
between
them
it
was
indeed
a
singular
household
thus
buried
away
in
the
heart
of
these
lonely
mountains
the
stately
old
mansion
was
just
the
right
setting
for
for
unbidden
into
his
mind
a
queer
new
thought
shot
suddenly
interrupting
the
flow
of
ideas
he
never
understood
how
or
whence
it
came
but
with
the
picture
of
all
the
empty
rooms
in
the
corridor
about
him
he
received
the
sharp
unwelcome
impression
that
when
skale
described
the
house
as
empty
it
was
really
nothing
of
the
sort
utterly
unannounced
the
uneasy
conviction
took
possession
of
him
that
the
building
was
actually
populated
it
was
an
extraordinary
idea
to
have
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
the
way
of
evidence
to
support
it
and
with
it
flashed
across
his
memory
echoes
of
that
unusual
catechism
he
had
been
subjected
to
in
particular
the
questions
whether
he
believed
in
spirits
other
life
as
skale
termed
it
sinister
suspicions
flashed
through
his
imagination
as
he
lay
there
listening
to
the
ashes
dropping
in
the
grate
and
watching
the
shadows
cloak
the
room
was
it
possible
that
there
were
occupants
of
these
rooms
that
the
man
had
somehow
evoked
from
the
interstellar
spaces
and
crystallized
by
means
of
sound
into
form
and
shape
something
freezing
swept
into
him
from
a
region
far
beyond
the
world
he
shivered
these
cold
terrors
that
grip
the
soul
suddenly
without
apparent
cause
whence
do
they
come
why
out
of
these
rather
extravagant
and
baseless
speculations
should
have
emerged
this
sense
of
throttling
dread
that
appalled
him
and
why
once
again
should
he
have
felt
convinced
that
the
ultimate
nature
of
the
clergyman
great
experiment
was
impious
fraught
with
a
kind
of
heavenly
danger
unpermissible
spinrobin
lying
there
shivering
in
his
big
bed
could
not
guess
he
only
knew
that
by
way
of
relief
his
mind
instinctively
sought
out
miriam
and
so
found
peace
curled
up
in
a
ball
between
the
sheets
his
body
presently
slept
while
his
mind
intensely
active
traveled
off
into
that
vast
inner
prairie
of
his
childhood
days
and
called
her
name
aloud
and
presumably
she
came
to
him
at
once
for
his
sleep
was
undisturbed
and
his
dreams
uncommonly
sweet
and
he
woke
thoroughly
refreshed
eight
hours
later
to
find
mawle
standing
beside
his
bed
with
thin
bread
and
butter
and
a
cup
of
steaming
tea
ii
for
the
rest
the
new
secretary
fell
quickly
and
easily
into
the
routine
of
this
odd
little
household
for
he
had
great
powers
of
adaptability
at
first
the
promise
of
excitement
faded
the
mornings
were
spent
in
the
study
of
hebrew
skale
taking
great
pains
to
instruct
him
in
the
vibratory
pronunciation
for
so
he
termed
it
of
certain
words
and
especially
of
the
divine
or
angelic
names
the
correct
utterance
involving
a
kind
of
prolonged
and
sonorous
vibration
of
the
vowels
appeared
to
be
of
supreme
importance
he
further
taught
him
curious
correspondences
between
sound
and
number
and
the
attribution
to
these
again
of
certain
colors
the
vibrations
of
sound
and
light
as
air
and
ether
had
intrinsic
importance
it
seemed
in
the
uttering
of
certain
names
all
of
which
however
spinrobin
learnt
by
rote
making
neither
head
nor
tail
of
it
that
there
were
definite
results
though
he
could
not
deny
psychic
results
for
a
name
uttered
correctly
produced
one
effect
and
uttered
wrongly
produced
another
just
as
a
wrong
note
in
a
chord
afflicts
the
hearer
whereas
the
right
one
blesses
the
afternoons
wet
or
fine
they
went
for
long
walks
together
about
the
desolate
hills
miriam
sometimes
accompanying
them
their
talk
and
laughter
echoed
all
over
the
mountains
but
there
was
no
one
to
hear
them
the
nearest
village
being
several
miles
away
and
the
railway
station
nothing
but
a
railway
station
the
isolation
was
severe
there
were
no
callers
but
the
provision
carts
letters
had
to
be
fetched
and
newspapers
were
neglected
arrayed
in
fluffy
tweeds
with
baggy
knickerbockers
and
boots
he
trotted
beside
his
giant
companion
over
the
moors
somewhat
like
a
child
who
expected
its
hand
to
be
taken
over
difficult
places
his
confidence
had
been
completely
won
the
sense
of
shyness
left
him
he
felt
that
he
already
stood
to
the
visionary
clergyman
in
a
relationship
that
was
more
than
secretarial
he
still
panted
but
with
enthusiasm
instead
of
with
regret
in
the
background
loomed
always
the
dim
sense
of
the
discovery
and
experiment
approaching
inevitably
just
as
in
childhood
the
idea
of
heaven
and
hell
had
stood
waiting
to
catch
him
real
only
when
he
thought
carefully
about
them
skale
was
just
the
kind
of
man
he
felt
who
would
make
a
discovery
so
simple
that
the
rest
of
the
world
had
overlooked
it
so
tremendous
that
it
struck
at
the
roots
of
human
knowledge
he
had
the
simple
originality
of
genius
and
a
good
deal
of
its
inspirational
quality
as
well
before
ten
days
had
passed
he
was
following
him
about
like
a
dog
hanging
upon
his
lightest
word
new
currents
ran
through
him
mentally
and
spiritually
as
the
fires
of
skale
vivid
personality
quickened
his
own
and
the
impetus
of
his
inner
life
lifted
him
with
its
more
violent
momentum
the
world
of
an
ordinary
man
is
so
circumscribed
so
conventionally
molded
that
he
can
scarcely
conceive
of
things
that
may
dwell
normally
in
the
mind
of
an
extraordinary
man
adumbrations
of
these
however
may
throw
their
shadow
across
his
field
of
vision
spinrobin
was
ordinary
in
most
ways
while
skale
was
in
nearly
all
and
thus
living
together
in
this
intimate
solitude
the
secretary
got
peeps
into
his
companion
region
that
gradually
convinced
him
with
cleaned
nerves
and
vision
he
began
to
think
in
ways
and
terms
that
were
new
to
him
skale
like
some
big
figure
in
story
or
legend
moved
forward
into
his
life
and
waved
a
wand
his
own
smaller
personality
began
to
expand
thoughts
entered
unannounced
that
hitherto
had
not
even
knocked
at
the
door
and
the
frontiers
of
his
mind
first
wavered
then
unfolded
to
admit
them
the
clergyman
world
whether
he
himself
were
mad
or
sane
was
a
real
world
alive
vibrating
shortly
to
produce
practical
results
spinrobin
would
have
staked
his
very
life
upon
it
and
meanwhile
he
made
love
openly
under
any
other
conditions
outrageously
to
miriam
whose
figure
of
soft
beauty
moving
silently
about
the
house
helped
to
redeem
it
she
rendered
him
quiet
little
services
of
her
own
accord
that
pleased
him
immensely
for
occasionally
he
detected
her
delicate
perfume
about
his
room
and
he
was
sure
it
was
not
mawle
who
put
the
fresh
heather
in
the
glass
jars
upon
his
table
or
arranged
his
papers
with
such
neat
precision
on
the
desk
her
delicate
shining
little
face
with
its
wreath
of
dark
hair
went
with
him
everywhere
hauntingly
possessingly
and
when
he
kissed
her
as
he
did
now
every
morning
and
every
evening
under
skale
very
eyes
it
was
like
plunging
his
lips
into
a
bed
of
wild
flowers
that
no
artificial
process
had
ever
touched
something
in
him
sang
when
she
was
near
she
had
too
what
he
used
to
call
as
a
boy
night
eyes
changing
after
dusk
into
such
shadowy
depths
that
to
look
them
was
to
look
beyond
and
through
them
the
sight
could
never
rest
only
upon
their
surface
through
her
eyes
then
stretched
all
the
delight
of
that
old
immense
where
names
clothed
described
and
summoned
living
realities
his
attitude
towards
her
was
odd
yet
comprehensible
for
though
his
desire
was
unquestionably
great
it
was
not
particularly
active
probably
because
he
knew
that
he
held
her
and
that
no
aggressive
effort
was
necessary
secure
in
the
feeling
that
she
belonged
to
him
and
he
to
her
he
also
found
that
he
had
little
enough
to
say
to
her
never
anything
to
ask
she
knew
and
understood
it
all
beforehand
expression
was
uncalled
for
as
well
might
the
brimming
kettle
sing
to
the
water
i
contain
you
or
the
water
reply
i
fill
you
only
this
was
not
the
simile
he
used
in
his
own
thoughts
from
the
very
beginning
he
had
used
the
analogy
of
sound
of
the
chord
as
well
might
one
note
feel
called
upon
to
cry
to
another
in
the
same
chord
hark
sounding
with
you
as
that
spinrobin
should
say
to
miriam
my
heart
responds
and
sings
to
yours
after
a
period
of
separation
however
he
became
charged
with
things
he
wanted
to
say
to
her
all
of
which
vanished
utterly
the
moment
they
came
together
words
instantly
then
became
unnecessary
foolish
he
heard
that
faint
internal
singing
and
his
own
resonant
response
and
they
merely
stayed
there
side
by
side
completely
happy
everything
told
without
speech
this
sense
of
blissful
union
enwrapped
his
soul
in
the
language
of
his
boyhood
he
had
found
her
name
he
knew
her
she
was
his
yet
sometimes
they
did
talk
and
their
conversations
in
any
other
setting
but
this
amazing
one
provided
by
the
wizardry
of
enthusiasm
must
have
seemed
exquisitely
ludicrous
in
the
room
often
with
the
clergyman
a
few
feet
away
reading
by
the
fire
they
would
sit
in
the
window
niche
gazing
into
one
another
eyes
perhaps
even
holding
hands
then
after
a
long
interval
of
silence
skale
would
hear
spinrobin
thin
accents
you
brilliant
little
sound
i
hear
you
everywhere
within
me
chanting
a
song
of
life
and
miriam
reply
thrilled
and
gentle
i
but
your
perfect
echo
my
whole
life
sings
with
yours
whereupon
kissing
softly
they
would
separate
and
skale
would
cover
them
mentally
with
his
blessing
sometimes
too
he
would
send
for
the
housekeeper
and
with
the
aid
of
the
violin
would
lead
the
four
voices
his
own
bass
included
through
the
changes
of
various
chords
for
the
vibratory
utterance
of
certain
names
and
the
beauty
of
these
sounds
singing
the
divine
names
would
make
the
secretary
swell
to
twice
his
normal
value
and
importance
thus
he
puts
it
as
the
forces
awakened
by
the
music
poured
and
surged
into
the
atmosphere
about
them
whereupon
the
clergyman
would
explain
with
burning
words
that
many
a
symphony
of
beethoven
a
sonata
of
schumann
or
a
suite
of
tschaikovsky
were
the
names
peaceful
romantic
or
melancholy
of
great
spiritual
potencies
heard
partially
by
these
masters
in
their
moments
of
inspirational
ecstasy
the
powers
of
these
beings
were
just
as
characteristic
their
existence
just
as
real
as
the
simpler
names
of
the
hebrew
angels
and
their
psychic
influence
upon
the
soul
that
heard
them
uttered
just
as
sure
and
individual
for
the
power
of
music
my
dear
spinrobin
has
never
yet
by
science
or
philosophy
been
adequately
explained
and
never
can
be
until
the
occult
nature
of
sound
and
its
correlations
with
color
form
and
number
is
once
again
understood
is
the
first
law
of
the
physical
creation
says
one
music
is
a
breaking
into
sound
of
the
fundamental
rhythm
of
universal
being
and
harmony
declares
plato
their
way
into
the
secret
places
of
the
soul
is
the
manifestation
whispers
the
deaf
beethoven
the
inner
essential
nature
of
all
that
is
or
in
the
hint
of
leibnitz
is
a
calculation
which
the
soul
makes
unconsciously
in
secret
it
is
in
search
of
a
name
sang
george
eliot
nearer
in
her
intuition
to
the
truth
than
all
the
philosophers
since
love
is
the
dynamic
of
pure
spirit
but
i
he
continued
after
a
pause
for
breath
and
smiling
amid
the
glow
of
his
great
enthusiasm
go
beyond
and
behind
them
all
into
the
very
heart
of
the
secret
for
you
shall
learn
that
to
know
the
sounds
of
the
great
names
and
to
utter
their
music
correctly
shall
merge
yourself
into
the
heart
of
their
deific
natures
and
make
you
the
gods
themselves
and
spinrobin
as
he
listened
noticed
that
a
slight
trembling
ran
across
the
fabric
of
his
normal
world
as
though
it
were
about
to
vanish
and
give
place
to
another
a
new
world
of
divine
things
made
utterly
simple
for
many
things
that
skale
said
in
this
easy
natural
way
he
felt
were
in
the
nature
of
clues
and
passwords
whose
effect
he
carefully
noted
upon
his
secretary
being
intended
to
urge
him
with
a
certain
violence
even
into
the
desired
region
skale
was
testing
him
all
the
time
iii
and
it
was
about
this
time
more
than
half
way
through
the
trial
month
that
the
clergyman
took
spinrobin
now
become
far
more
than
merely
secretary
into
his
fuller
confidence
in
a
series
of
singular
conversations
which
the
bewildered
little
fellow
has
reported
to
the
best
of
his
ability
he
explained
to
him
something
of
the
science
of
true
names
and
to
prove
it
he
made
two
singular
experiments
first
he
uttered
the
true
name
of
mawle
secondly
of
spinrobin
himself
with
results
that
shall
presently
be
told
these
things
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
know
and
understand
before
they
made
the
great
experiment
otherwise
if
unprepared
he
might
witness
results
that
would
involve
the
loss
of
and
the
failure
therefore
of
the
experiment
a
disaster
too
formidable
to
contemplate
by
way
of
leading
up
to
this
however
he
gave
him
some
account
first
of
the
original
discovery
spinrobin
asked
few
questions
made
few
comments
he
took
notes
however
of
all
he
heard
and
at
night
wrote
them
up
as
best
he
could
in
his
diary
at
times
the
clergyman
rose
and
interrupted
the
strange
recital
by
moving
about
the
room
with
his
soft
and
giant
stride
talking
even
while
his
back
was
turned
and
at
times
the
astonished
secretary
wrote
so
furiously
that
he
broke
his
pencil
with
a
snap
and
skale
had
to
wait
while
he
sharpened
it
again
his
inner
excitement
was
so
great
that
he
almost
felt
he
emitted
sparks
the
clue
it
appears
came
to
the
clergyman
by
mere
chance
though
he
admits
his
belief
that
the
habits
of
asceticism
and
meditation
he
had
practiced
for
years
may
have
made
him
in
some
way
receptive
to
the
vision
for
as
a
vision
it
seems
the
thing
first
presented
itself
a
vision
made
possible
by
a
moment
of
very
rapid
hypnosis
an
anglican
priest
at
the
time
in
charge
of
a
small
norfolk
parish
he
was
a
great
believer
in
the
value
of
ceremonial
in
the
use
that
is
of
color
odor
and
sound
to
induce
mental
states
of
worship
and
adoration
more
especially
however
of
sound
as
uttered
by
the
voice
the
human
voice
being
unique
among
instruments
in
that
it
combined
the
characteristics
of
all
other
sounds
intoning
therefore
was
to
him
a
matter
of
psychic
importance
and
it
was
one
summer
evening
intoning
in
the
chancel
that
he
noticed
suddenly
certain
very
curious
results
the
faces
of
two
individuals
in
the
congregation
underwent
a
charming
and
singular
change
a
change
which
he
would
not
describe
more
particularly
at
the
moment
since
spinrobin
should
presently
witness
it
for
himself
it
all
happened
in
a
flash
in
less
than
a
second
and
it
is
probable
he
holds
that
his
own
voice
induced
an
instant
of
swift
and
passing
hypnosis
upon
himself
for
as
he
stood
there
at
the
lectern
there
came
upon
him
a
moment
of
keen
interior
lucidity
in
which
he
realized
beyond
doubt
or
question
what
had
happened
the
use
of
voice
bell
or
gong
has
long
been
known
as
a
means
of
inducing
the
hypnotic
state
and
during
this
almost
instantaneous
trance
of
his
there
came
a
sudden
revelation
of
the
magical
possibilities
of
by
some
chance
rhythm
of
his
intoning
voice
he
had
hit
upon
the
exact
pitch
quality
and
accent
which
constituted
the
note
of
more
than
one
member
of
the
congregation
before
him
those
particular
individuals
without
being
aware
of
the
fact
had
at
once
responded
automatically
and
inevitably
for
a
second
he
had
heard
he
knew
their
true
names
he
had
unwittingly
called
them
spinrobin
heart
leaped
with
excitement
as
he
listened
for
this
idea
of
naming
true
carried
him
back
to
the
haunted
days
of
his
childhood
clairvoyance
when
he
had
known
winky
i
do
understand
skale
he
put
in
desirous
to
hear
a
more
detailed
explanation
but
presently
you
shall
was
all
the
clergyman
vouchsafed
the
clue
thus
provided
by
chance
he
had
followed
up
but
by
methods
hard
to
describe
apparently
a
corner
of
the
veil
momentarily
lifted
had
betrayed
the
value
that
lies
in
the
repetition
of
certain
sounds
the
rhythmic
reiteration
of
syllables
in
a
word
of
chanting
or
incantation
by
diving
down
into
his
subconscious
region
already
prepared
by
long
spiritual
training
he
gradually
succeeded
in
drawing
out
further
details
piece
by
piece
and
finally
by
infinite
practice
and
prayer
welding
them
together
into
an
intelligible
system
the
science
of
slowly
with
the
efforts
of
years
revealed
itself
his
mind
slipped
past
the
deceit
of
mere
sensible
appearances
he
heard
the
true
inner
names
of
things
and
persons
skale
rose
from
his
chair
with
thumbs
in
the
armholes
of
his
waistcoat
and
fingers
drumming
loudly
on
his
breast
he
stood
over
the
secretary
who
continued
making
frantic
notes
that
chance
discovery
then
made
during
a
moment
inner
vision
he
continued
with
a
grave
excitement
gave
me
the
key
to
a
whole
world
of
new
knowledge
and
since
then
i
have
made
incredible
developments
listen
closely
spinrobin
while
i
explain
and
take
in
what
you
can
the
secretary
laid
down
his
pencil
and
notebook
he
sat
forward
in
an
attitude
of
intense
eagerness
upon
the
edge
of
his
chair
he
was
trembling
this
strange
modern
confirmation
of
his
early
heaven
of
wonder
before
the
senses
had
thickened
and
concealed
it
laid
bare
again
his
earliest
world
of
pristine
glory
the
ordinary
name
of
a
person
understand
then
is
merely
a
sound
attached
to
their
physical
appearance
at
birth
by
the
parents
a
meaningless
sound
it
is
not
their
true
name
that
however
exists
behind
it
in
the
spiritual
world
and
is
the
accurate
description
of
the
soul
it
is
the
sound
you
express
visibly
before
me
the
word
is
the
life
spinrobin
surreptitiously
picked
up
his
pencil
but
the
clergyman
spied
the
movement
never
mind
the
notes
he
said
listen
closely
to
me
spinrobin
obeyed
meekly
your
ordinary
outer
name
however
continued
skale
speaking
with
profound
conviction
may
be
made
a
conductor
to
your
true
inner
one
the
connection
between
the
two
by
a
series
of
subtle
interior
links
forms
gradually
with
the
years
for
even
the
ordinary
name
if
you
reflect
a
moment
becomes
in
time
a
sound
of
singular
authority
inwoven
with
the
finest
threads
of
your
psychical
being
so
that
in
a
sense
you
it
to
hear
it
suddenly
called
aloud
in
the
night
in
a
room
full
of
people
in
the
street
unexpectedly
is
to
know
a
shock
however
small
of
increased
vitality
it
touches
the
imagination
it
calls
upon
the
soul
built
up
around
it
he
paused
a
moment
his
voice
boomed
musically
about
the
room
even
after
he
ceased
speaking
bewildered
wondering
delighted
spinrobin
drank
in
every
word
how
well
he
knew
it
all
now
resumed
the
clergyman
lowering
his
tone
unconsciously
the
first
part
of
my
discovery
lies
in
this
that
i
have
learned
to
pronounce
the
ordinary
names
of
things
and
people
in
such
a
way
as
to
lead
me
to
their
true
inner
ones
but
interrupted
spinrobin
irrepressibly
how
in
the
name
of
hush
cried
skale
quickly
never
again
call
upon
a
mighty
name
in
vain
it
is
dangerous
concentrate
your
mind
upon
what
i
now
tell
you
and
you
shall
understand
a
part
at
least
of
my
discovery
as
i
was
saying
i
have
learned
how
to
find
the
true
name
by
means
of
the
false
and
understand
if
you
can
that
to
pronounce
a
true
name
correctly
means
to
participate
in
its
very
life
to
vibrate
with
its
essential
nature
to
learn
the
ultimate
secret
of
its
inmost
being
for
our
true
names
are
the
sounds
originally
uttered
by
the
of
god
when
he
created
us
or
us
into
being
out
of
the
void
of
infinite
silence
and
to
repeat
them
correctly
means
literally
to
speak
with
his
voice
it
is
to
speak
the
truth
the
clergyman
dropped
his
tone
to
an
awed
whisper
words
are
the
veils
of
being
to
speak
them
truly
is
to
lift
a
corner
of
the
veil
what
a
glory
what
a
thing
exclaimed
the
other
under
his
breath
trying
to
keep
his
mind
steady
but
losing
control
of
language
in
the
attempt
the
great
sentences
seemed
to
change
the
little
room
into
a
temple
where
sacred
things
were
about
to
reveal
themselves
spinrobin
now
understood
in
a
measure
why
skale
utterance
of
his
own
name
and
that
of
miriam
had
sounded
grand
behind
each
he
had
touched
the
true
name
and
made
it
echo
the
clergyman
voice
brought
his
thoughts
back
from
distances
in
that
inner
prairie
of
his
youth
where
they
had
lost
themselves
for
all
of
us
he
was
repeating
with
rapt
expression
in
his
shining
eyes
are
sounds
in
the
mighty
music
the
universe
sings
to
god
whose
voice
it
was
that
first
produced
us
and
of
whose
awful
resonance
we
are
echoes
therefore
in
harmony
or
disharmony
a
look
of
power
passed
into
his
great
visage
spinrobin
imagination
in
spite
of
the
efforts
that
he
made
fluttered
with
broken
wings
behind
the
swift
words
a
flash
of
the
former
terror
stirred
in
the
depths
of
him
the
man
was
at
the
heels
of
knowledge
it
is
not
safe
for
humanity
to
seek
yes
he
continued
directing
his
gaze
again
upon
the
other
that
is
a
part
of
my
discovery

only
a
part

by
repeating
your
outer
name
in
a
certain
way
until
it
disappears
in
the
mind
i
can
arrive
at
the
real
name
within
and
to
utter
it
is
to
call
upon
the
secret

summon

by
said
jehovah
to
the
great
hebrew

thou
art
by
certain

and
vibratory
modulations
of
the
voice

is
possible
to
produce
harmonics

went
on
reverently
with
glowing
eyes
and
intense
conviction
pronounce
them
with
full
vibratory
power
that
awakens
all
their
harmonics
and
you
awaken
also
their
counterpart
in
yourself
you
summon
their
strength
or
characteristic
quality
to
your
aid
you
introduce
their
powers
actively
into
your
own
psychical
being
had
jacob
succeeded
in
discovering
the
of
that
with
whom
he
wrestled
he
would
have
become
one
with
its
superior
power
and
have
thus
conquered
it
only
he
asked
instead
of
commanded
and
he
found
it
not
magnificent
splendid
cried
spinrobin
starting
from
his
chair
seizing
with
his
imagination
potently
stirred
this
possibility
of
developing
character
and
rousing
the
forces
of
the
soul
we
shall
yet
call
upon
the
names
and
see
replied
skale
placing
a
great
hand
upon
his
companion
shoulder
not
aloud
necessarily
but
by
an
inner
effort
of
intense
will
which
sets
in
vibration
the
finer
harmonics
heard
only
by
the
poet
and
magician
those
harmonics
and
overtones
which
embody
the
psychical
element
in
music
for
the
methods
of
poet
and
magician
i
tell
you
my
dear
spinrobin
are
identical
and
all
the
faiths
of
the
world
are
at
the
heels
of
that
thought
provided
you
have
faith
you
can
move
mountains
you
can
call
upon
the
very
gods
a
most
wonderful
idea
skale
faltered
the
other
breathlessly
quite
wonderful
the
huge
sentences
deafened
him
a
little
with
their
mental
thunder
and
utterly
simple
was
the
reply
for
all
truth
is
simple
he
paced
the
floor
like
a
great
caged
animal
he
went
down
and
leaned
against
the
dark
bookcase
with
his
legs
wide
apart
and
hands
in
his
coat
pockets
to
name
truly
you
see
is
to
evoke
to
create
he
roared
from
the
end
of
the
room
to
utter
as
it
should
be
uttered
any
one
of
the
ten
words
or
creative
powers
of
the
deity
in
the
old
hebrew
system
is
to
become
master
of
the
to
which
it
corresponds
for
these
names
are
still
in
living
contact
with
the
realities
behind
it
means
to
vibrate
with
the
powers
that
called
the
universe
into
being
and
into
form
a
sort
of
shadowy
majesty
draped
his
huge
figure
spinrobin
thought
as
he
stood
in
at
the
end
of
the
room
and
thundered
forth
these
extraordinary
sentences
with
a
conviction
that
for
the
moment
at
least
swept
away
all
doubt
in
the
mind
of
his
listener
dreadful
ideas
and
threatening
rushed
to
and
fro
in
the
secretary
mind
he
was
torn
away
from
all
known
anchorage
staggered
dizzy
and
dismayed
yet
at
the
same
time
owing
to
his
temperament
a
prey
to
some
secret
and
delightful
exaltation
of
the
spirit
he
was
out
of
his
depth
in
great
waters
then
quite
suddenly
skale
came
swiftly
over
to
his
side
and
whispered
in
accents
that
were
soothing
in
comparison
and
think
for
a
moment
how
beautiful
the
huge
words
by
which
god
called
into
being
the
worlds
and
sent
the
perfect
rounded
bodies
of
the
spheres
spinning
and
singing
blazing
their
eternal
trails
of
glory
through
the
void
how
sweet
the
whisper
that
crystallized
in
flowers
how
tender
the
note
that
fashioned
the
eyes
and
face
say
of
miriam
at
the
name
of
miriam
he
felt
caught
up
and
glorified
in
some
delightful
and
inexplicable
way
that
brought
with
it
peace
the
power
of
all
these
strange
and
glowing
thoughts
poured
their
full
tide
into
his
own
rather
arid
and
thirsty
world
frightening
him
with
their
terrific
force
but
the
mere
utterance
of
that
delightful
name
in
the
way
skale
uttered
it
brought
confidence
and
peace
could
we
but
hear
them
skale
continued
half
to
himself
half
to
his
probationer
for
the
sad
thing
is
that
today
the
world
has
ears
yet
can
not
hear
as
light
is
distorted
by
passing
through
a
gross
atmosphere
so
sound
reaches
us
but
indistinctly
now
and
few
true
names
can
bring
their
wondrous
messages
of
power
correctly
men
coarsening
with
the
materialism
of
the
ages
have
grown
thick
and
gross
with
the
luxury
of
inventions
and
the
diseases
of
modern
life
that
develop
intellect
at
the
expense
of
soul
they
have
lost
the
old
inner
hearing
of
divine
sound
and
but
one
here
and
there
can
still
catch
the
faint
and
ineffable
music
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
his
voice
became
low
and
even
gentle
as
the
glowing
words
fell
from
his
heart
of
longing
none
hear
now
the
morning
stars
when
they
sing
together
to
the
sun
none
know
the
chanting
of
the
spheres
the
ears
of
the
world
are
stopped
with
lust
and
the
old
divine
science
of
seems
lost
forever
amid
the
crash
of
engines
and
the
noisy
thunder
of
machinery
only
among
flowers
and
certain
gems
are
the
accurate
old
true
names
still
to
be
found
but
we
are
on
the
track
my
dear
spinrobin
we
are
on
the
ancient
trail
to
power
the
clergyman
closed
his
eyes
and
clasped
his
hands
lifting
his
face
upwards
with
a
rapt
expression
while
he
murmured
under
his
breath
the
description
of
the
rider
on
the
white
horse
from
the
book
of
the
revelations
as
though
it
held
some
inner
meaning
that
his
heart
knew
yet
dared
not
divulge
and
he
had
a
name
written
that
no
man
knew
but
he
himself
and
he
was
clothed
in
a
vesture
dipped
in
blood
and
his
name
is
called
the
word
of
god
and
he
hath
on
his
vesture
and
on
his
thigh
a
name
written
of
kings
and
lord
of
lords
and
for
an
instant
spinrobin
listening
to
the
rolling
sound
but
not
to
the
actual
words
fancied
that
a
faintly
colored
atmosphere
of
deep
scarlet
accompanied
the
vibrations
of
his
resonant
whisper
and
produced
in
the
depths
of
his
mind
this
momentary
effect
of
colored
audition
it
was
all
very
strange
and
puzzling
he
tried
however
to
keep
an
open
mind
and
struggle
as
best
he
might
with
these
big
swells
that
rolled
into
his
little
pool
of
life
and
threatened
to
merge
it
in
a
vaster
tide
than
he
had
yet
dreamed
of
knowing
how
limited
is
the
world
which
the
senses
report
he
saw
nothing
too
inconceivable
in
the
idea
that
certain
persons
might
possess
a
peculiar
inner
structure
of
the
spirit
by
which
supersensuous
things
can
be
perceived
and
what
more
likely
than
that
a
man
of
skale
unusual
caliber
should
belong
to
them
indeed
that
the
clergyman
possessed
certain
practical
powers
of
an
extraordinary
description
he
was
as
certain
as
that
the
house
was
not
empty
as
he
had
at
first
supposed
of
neither
had
he
proof
as
yet
but
proof
was
not
long
in
forthcoming
chapter
iv
i
then
if
there
is
so
much
sound
about
in
all
objects
and
forms
if
the
whole
universe
in
fact
is
sounding
asked
spinrobin
with
a
naïve
impertinence
not
intended
but
due
to
the
reaction
of
his
simple
mind
from
all
this
vague
splendor
why
do
we
hear
it
more
skale
came
upon
him
like
a
boomerang
from
the
end
of
the
room
he
was
smiling
he
approved
the
question
with
us
the
question
of
hearing
is
merely
the
question
of
wavelengths
in
the
air
he
replied
the
lowest
audible
sound
having
a
wavelength
of
sixteen
feet
the
highest
less
than
an
inch
some
people
ca
hear
the
squeak
of
a
bat
others
the
rumble
of
an
earthquake
i
merely
affirm
that
in
every
form
sleeps
the
creative
sound
that
is
its
life
and
being
the
ear
is
a
miserable
organ
at
best
and
the
majority
are
far
too
gross
to
know
what
about
sounds
for
instance
that
have
a
wavelength
of
a
hundred
a
thousand
miles
on
the
one
hand
or
a
millionth
part
of
an
inch
on
the
other
a
thousand
miles
a
millionth
of
an
inch
gasped
the
other
gazing
at
his
interlocutor
as
though
he
was
some
great
archangel
of
sound
sound
for
most
of
us
lies
between
say
thirty
and
many
thousand
vibrations
per
second
the
cry
of
the
earthquake
and
the
cricket
it
is
our
limitation
that
renders
the
voice
of
the
dewdrop
and
the
voice
of
the
planet
alike
inaudible
we
even
mistake
a
measure
of
noise
like
a
continuous
millwheel
or
a
river
say
for
silence
when
in
reality
there
is
no
such
thing
as
perfect
silence
other
life
is
all
the
time
singing
and
thundering
about
us
he
added
holding
up
a
giant
finger
as
though
to
listen
to
the
imperfection
of
our
ears
you
may
ascribe
the
fact
that
we
do
not
hear
the
morning
stars
shouting
together
thank
you
yes
i
quite
see
now
said
the
secretary
to
name
truly
is
to
hear
truly
the
clergyman
words
seemed
to
hold
a
lamp
to
a
vast
interior
map
in
his
mind
that
was
growing
light
a
new
dawn
was
breaking
over
the
great
mental
prairie
where
he
wandered
as
a
child
to
find
the
true
name
of
anything
he
added
you
mean
is
to
hear
its
sound
its
individual
note
as
it
were
incredible
perspectives
swam
into
his
ken
hitherto
undreamed
of
not
it
were
boomed
the
other
you
hear
it
after
which
the
next
step
is
to
utter
it
and
so
absorb
its
force
into
your
own
being
by
synchronous
vibration
union
mystical
and
actual
only
you
must
be
sure
you
utter
it
correctly
to
pronounce
incorrectly
is
to
call
it
incompletely
into
life
and
form
to
distort
and
injure
it
and
yourself
with
it
to
make
it
untrue
a
lie
they
were
standing
in
the
dusk
by
the
library
window
watching
the
veil
of
night
that
slowly
covered
the
hills
the
flying
horizons
of
the
moors
had
slipped
away
into
the
darkness
the
stars
were
whispering
together
their
thoughts
of
flame
and
speed
at
the
back
of
the
room
sat
miriam
among
the
shadows
like
some
melody
hovering
in
a
musician
mind
till
he
should
call
her
forth
it
was
close
upon
the
tea
hour
behind
them
mawle
was
busying
herself
with
lamps
and
fire
skale
turning
at
the
sound
of
the
housekeeper
motioned
to
the
secretary
to
approach
then
stooped
down
and
spoke
low
in
his
ear
with
many
names
i
had
great
difficulty
he
whispered
with
hers
for
instance
indicating
the
housekeeper
behind
them
it
took
me
five
years
continuous
research
to
establish
her
general
and
even
then
i
at
first
only
derived
a
portion
of
her
name
and
in
uttering
it
i
made
such
errors
of
omission
and
pronunciation
that
her
physical
form
suffered
and
she
emerged
from
the
ordeal
in
disorder
you
have
of
course
noticed
her
disabilities
but
later
though
only
in
stammering
fashion
i
called
upon
her
all
complete
and
she
has
since
known
a
serene
blessedness
and
a
sense
of
her
great
value
in
the
music
of
life
that
she
never
knew
before
his
face
lit
up
as
he
spoke
of
it
for
in
that
moment
she
found
herself
she
heard
her
true
name
god
creative
sound
thunder
through
her
being
spinrobin
feeling
the
clergyman
forces
pouring
through
him
like
a
tide
at
such
close
proximity
bowed
his
head
his
lips
were
too
dry
to
frame
words
he
was
thinking
of
the
possible
effects
upon
his
own
soul
and
body
when
his
name
too
should
be
uttered
he
remembered
the
withered
arm
and
the
deafness
he
thought
too
of
that
slender
ghostly
figure
that
haunted
the
house
with
its
soft
movements
and
tender
singing
lastly
he
remembered
his
strange
conviction
that
somewhere
in
the
great
building
possibly
in
his
own
corridor
there
were
other
occupants
other
life
beings
of
unearthly
scale
waiting
the
given
moment
to
appear
summoned
by
utterance
and
you
will
understand
now
why
it
is
i
want
a
man
of
high
courage
to
help
me
skale
resumed
in
a
louder
tone
standing
sharply
upright
a
man
careless
of
physical
existence
and
with
a
faith
wholly
beyond
the
things
of
this
world
i
do
indeed
he
managed
to
reply
aloud
while
in
his
thoughts
he
was
saying
i
will
i
see
it
through
i
wo
give
in
with
all
his
might
he
resisted
the
invading
tide
of
terror
even
if
sad
results
came
later
it
was
something
to
have
been
sacrificed
in
so
big
a
conception
in
his
excitement
he
slipped
from
the
edge
of
the
windowsill
where
he
was
perched
and
skale
standing
close
in
front
of
him
caught
his
two
wrists
and
set
him
upon
his
feet
a
shock
like
a
rush
of
electricity
ran
through
him
he
took
his
courage
boldly
in
both
hands
and
asked
the
question
ever
burning
at
the
back
of
his
mind
then
this
great
experiment
you
we
have
in
view
he
stammered
is
to
do
with
the
correct
uttering
of
the
names
of
some
of
the
great
forces
or
angels
and
and
the
assimilating
of
their
powers
into
ourselves
skale
rose
up
gigantically
beside
him
no
sir
he
cried
it
is
greater
infinitely
greater
than
that
names
of
mere
angels
i
can
call
alone
without
the
help
of
any
one
but
for
the
name
i
wish
to
utter
a
whole
chord
is
necessary
even
to
compass
the
utterance
of
the
opening
syllable
as
i
have
told
you
already
a
chord
in
which
you
share
the
incalculable
privilege
of
being
the
tenor
note
but
for
the
completed
syllables
the
full
name
he
closed
his
eyes
and
shrugged
his
massive
shoulders
i
may
need
the
massed
orchestras
of
half
the
world
the
chorused
voices
of
the
entire
nation
or
in
their
place
a
still
small
voice
of
utter
purity
crying
in
the
wilderness
in
time
you
shall
know
fully
know
see
and
hear
for
the
present
hold
your
soul
with
what
patience
and
courage
you
may
the
words
thundered
about
the
room
so
that
miriam
too
heard
them
spinrobin
trembled
inwardly
as
though
a
cold
air
passed
him
the
suggestion
of
immense
possibilities
vague
yet
terrible
overwhelmed
him
again
suddenly
had
not
the
girl
at
that
moment
moved
up
beside
him
and
put
her
exquisite
pale
face
over
his
shoulder
with
her
hand
upon
his
arm
it
is
probable
he
would
then
and
there
have
informed
skale
that
he
withdrew
from
the
whole
affair
whatever
happens
murmured
miriam
gazing
into
his
eyes
we
go
on
singing
and
sounding
together
you
and
i
then
as
spinrobin
bent
down
and
kissed
her
hair
skale
put
an
arm
round
each
of
them
and
drew
them
over
to
the
tea
table
come
spinrobin
he
said
with
his
winning
smile
you
must
not
be
alarmed
you
know
you
must
not
desert
me
you
are
necessary
to
us
all
and
when
my
experiment
is
complete
we
shall
all
be
as
gods
together
do
not
falter
there
is
nothing
in
life
remember
but
to
lose
oneself
and
i
have
found
a
better
way
of
doing
so
than
any
one
else
by
merging
ourselves
into
the
voice
of
skale
tea
has
been
standing
more
than
ten
minutes
interrupted
the
old
housekeeper
coming
up
behind
them
if
spinrobin
will
please
to
let
him
come
as
though
it
was
spinrobin
fault
that
there
had
been
delay
skale
laughed
as
the
two
men
suddenly
in
the
region
of
teacups
and
buttered
toast
looked
one
another
in
the
face
with
a
certain
confusion
miriam
sipping
her
tea
laughed
too
curiously
spinrobin
felt
restored
to
some
measure
of
safety
and
sanity
again
only
the
strange
emotion
of
a
few
moments
before
still
moved
there
unseen
among
them
listen
and
you
shall
presently
hear
her
name
the
clergyman
whispered
glancing
up
at
the
other
over
his
teacup
but
spinrobin
was
crunching
his
toast
too
noisily
to
notice
the
meaning
of
the
words
fully
ii
the
stage
manager
who
stands
behind
all
the
scenes
of
life
both
great
and
small
had
prepared
the
scene
well
for
what
was
to
follow
the
sentences
about
the
world
of
inaudible
sound
had
dropped
the
right
kind
of
suggestion
into
the
secretary
heart
his
mind
still
whirred
with
a
litter
of
sentences
and
ideas
however
and
he
was
vividly
haunted
by
the
actuality
of
truth
behind
them
all
his
whole
inner
being
at
that
moment
cried
hark
through
a
hush
of
expectant
wonder
there
they
sat
at
tea
this
singular
group
of
human
beings
skale
bigger
than
ever
in
his
loose
housesuit
of
black
swallowing
his
liquid
with
noisy
gulps
spinrobin
nibbling
slippery
morsels
of
hot
toast
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
miriam
quiet
and
mysterious
in
her
corner
and
mawle
sedate
respectful
in
cap
and
apron
presiding
over
the
teapot
the
whole
scene
cozily
lit
by
lamp
and
fire
when
this
remarkable
new
thing
happened
spinrobin
declares
always
that
it
came
upon
him
like
a
drowning
wave
frightening
him
not
with
any
idea
of
injury
to
himself
but
with
a
dreadful
sense
of
being
lost
and
shelterless
among
the
immensities
of
a
transcendent
new
world
something
passed
into
the
room
that
made
his
soul
shake
and
flutter
at
the
center
his
attention
was
first
roused
by
a
sound
that
he
took
perhaps
to
be
the
wind
coming
down
from
the
hills
in
those
draughts
and
gusts
he
sometimes
heard
only
to
his
imagination
now
it
was
a
peopled
wind
crying
round
the
walls
behind
whose
voice
he
detected
the
great
fluid
form
of
it
running
and
colored
but
with
the
noise
a
terror
that
was
no
ordinary
terror
invaded
the
recesses
of
his
soul
it
was
the
fear
of
the
unknown
dreadfully
multiplied
he
glanced
up
quickly
from
his
teacup
and
chancing
to
meet
miriam
eye
he
saw
that
she
was
smiling
as
she
watched
him
this
sound
then
had
some
special
significance
at
the
same
instant
he
perceived
that
it
was
not
outside
but
in
the
room
close
beside
him
that
skale
in
fact
was
talking
to
the
deaf
housekeeper
in
a
low
and
carefully
modulated
tone
a
tone
she
could
not
possibly
have
heard
however
then
he
discovered
that
the
clergyman
was
not
speaking
actually
but
repeating
her
name
he
was
intoning
it
it
grew
into
a
kind
of
singing
chant
an
incantation
sarah
mawle
sarah
mawle
sarah
mawle
ran
through
the
room
like
water
and
in
skale
mouth
it
sounded
as
his
own
name
had
sounded
different
it
became
in
some
significant
way
thus
spinrobin
expresses
it
always
stately
important
nay
even
august
it
became
real
the
syllables
led
his
ear
away
from
their
normal
signification
away
from
the
outer
toward
the
inner
his
ordinary
mental
picture
of
the
mere
letters
sarahmawle
disappeared
and
became
merged
in
something
else
into
something
alive
that
pulsed
and
moved
with
vibrations
of
its
own
for
with
the
outer
sound
there
grew
up
another
interior
one
that
finally
became
separate
and
distinct
now
spinrobin
was
well
aware
that
the
continued
repetition
of
one
own
name
can
induce
and
he
also
knew
that
the
reiteration
of
the
name
of
an
object
ends
by
making
that
object
disappear
from
the
mind
mustard
repeated
indefinitely
comes
to
have
no
meaning
at
all
the
mind
drops
behind
the
mere
symbol
of
the
sound
into
something
that
is
unintelligible
if
not
meaningless
but
here
it
was
altogether
another
matter
and
from
the
torrent
of
words
and
similes
he
uses
to
describe
it
this
a
curious
mixture
of
vividness
and
confusion
is
apparently
what
he
witnessed
for
as
the
clergyman
resonant
voice
continued
quietly
to
utter
the
name
something
passed
gradually
into
the
appearance
of
the
motherly
old
housekeeper
that
certainly
was
not
there
before
not
visible
at
least
to
the
secretary
eyes
behind
the
fleshly
covering
of
the
body
within
the
very
skin
and
bones
it
seemed
there
flowed
with
steady
splendor
an
effect
of
charging
new
vitality
that
had
an
air
of
radiating
from
her
face
and
figure
with
the
glow
and
rush
of
increased
life
a
suggestion
of
grandeur
genuine
and
convincing
began
to
express
itself
through
the
humble
domestic
exterior
of
her
everyday
self
at
first
as
though
some
greater
personage
towered
shadowy
behind
her
but
presently
with
a
growing
definiteness
that
showed
it
to
be
herself
and
nothing
separate
the
two
if
two
they
were
merged
her
mien
he
saw
first
softened
astonishingly
then
grew
firm
with
an
aspect
of
dignity
that
was
unbelievably
beautiful
an
air
of
peace
and
joy
her
face
had
always
possessed
but
this
was
something
beyond
either
it
was
something
imposing
majestic
so
perilously
adjusted
is
the
ludicrous
to
the
sublime
that
while
the
secretary
wondered
dumbly
whether
the
word
housekeeper
might
also
in
skale
new
world
connote
angel
he
could
have
laughed
aloud
had
not
the
nobility
of
the
spectacle
hinted
at
the
same
time
that
he
should
have
wept
for
the
tears
of
a
positive
worship
started
to
his
eyes
at
the
sight
sarahmawle
sarahmawle
the
name
continued
to
pour
itself
about
him
in
a
steady
ripple
neither
rising
nor
falling
and
certainly
not
audible
to
those
deaf
old
ears
that
flanked
the
vigorous
and
unwrinkled
face
youth
is
not
the
word
to
describe
this
appearance
of
ardent
intensity
that
flamed
out
of
the
form
and
features
of
the
housekeeper
for
it
was
something
utterly
apart
from
either
youth
or
age
nor
was
it
any
mere
idealization
of
her
worn
and
crumpled
self
it
was
independent
of
physical
conditions
as
it
was
independent
of
the
limitations
of
time
and
space
superb
as
sunshine
simple
as
the
glory
that
had
sometimes
touched
his
soul
of
boyhood
in
sleep
the
white
fires
of
an
utter
transfiguration
it
was
in
a
word
as
if
the
name
skale
uttered
had
summoned
to
the
front
through
all
disguising
barriers
of
flesh
her
true
and
naked
spirit
that
which
neither
ages
nor
dies
that
which
the
eyes
when
they
rest
upon
a
human
countenance
can
never
see
the
soul
itself
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
spinrobin
abashed
and
trembling
gazed
upon
something
in
human
guise
that
was
genuinely
sublime
perfect
with
a
stainless
purity
the
mere
sight
produced
in
him
an
exaltation
of
the
spirit
such
as
he
had
never
before
experienced
swallowing
up
his
first
terror
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
declares
he
prayed
for
this
was
the
natural
expression
for
an
emotion
of
the
volume
and
intensity
that
surged
within
him
how
long
he
sat
there
gazing
seems
uncertain
perhaps
minutes
perhaps
seconds
only
the
sense
of
time
passage
was
temporarily
annihilated
it
might
well
have
been
a
thousand
years
for
the
sight
somehow
swept
him
into
eternity
in
that
tearoom
of
skale
lonely
house
among
the
mountains
the
warmth
of
an
earthly
fire
upon
his
back
the
light
of
an
earthly
in
his
eyes
holding
buttered
toast
in
exceedingly
earthly
fingers
he
sat
face
to
face
with
something
that
yet
was
not
of
this
earth
something
majestic
spiritual
and
eternal
visible
evidence
of
transfiguration
and
of
earth
growing
heaven
it
was
of
course
stupid
and
clumsy
of
spinrobin
to
drop
his
teacup
and
let
it
smash
noisily
against
the
leg
of
the
table
yet
it
was
natural
enough
for
in
his
ecstasy
and
amazement
he
apparently
lost
control
of
certain
muscles
in
his
trembling
fingers
though
the
change
came
gradually
it
seemed
very
quick
the
volume
of
the
clergyman
voice
grew
less
and
as
the
tide
of
sound
ebbed
the
countenance
of
the
housekeeper
also
slowly
altered
the
flames
that
a
moment
before
had
burned
so
whitely
there
flickered
faintly
and
were
gone
the
glory
faded
the
splendor
withdrew
she
even
seemed
to
dwindle
in
size
she
resumed
her
normal
appearance
skale
voice
ceased
the
incident
apparently
had
occupied
but
a
few
moments
for
mawle
he
realized
was
gathering
the
plates
together
and
fitting
them
into
the
spaces
of
the
crowded
with
difficulty
an
operation
he
remembered
she
had
just
begun
when
the
clergyman
first
began
to
call
upon
her
name
she
clearly
had
been
conscious
of
nothing
unusual
a
moment
later
with
her
customary
combination
of
curtsey
and
bow
she
was
gone
from
the
room
and
spinrobin
acting
upon
a
strange
impulse
found
himself
standing
upright
by
the
table
looking
wildly
about
him
passing
his
hand
through
his
scattered
hair
and
trying
in
vain
to
utter
words
that
should
relieve
his
overcharged
soul
of
the
burden
of
glory
and
mystery
that
oppressed
it
a
pain
profoundly
searching
pierced
his
heart
he
thought
of
the
splendors
he
had
just
witnessed
and
of
the
joy
and
peace
upon
those
features
even
when
the
greater
wonder
withdrew
he
thought
of
the
power
in
the
countenance
of
skale
and
of
the
shining
loveliness
in
the
face
of
miriam
then
with
a
blast
of
bitterest
disappointment
he
realized
the
insignificance
of
his
own
self
the
earthiness
of
his
own
personality
the
dead
dull
ordinariness
of
his
own
appearance
why
oh
why
could
not
all
faces
let
the
soul
shine
through
why
could
not
all
identify
themselves
with
their
eternal
part
and
thus
learn
happiness
and
joy
a
sense
of
the
futile
agony
of
life
led
him
with
an
impassioned
eagerness
again
to
the
thought
of
skale
tremendous
visions
and
of
the
great
experiment
that
beckoned
beyond
only
once
more
the
terror
of
its
possible
meaning
dropped
upon
him
and
the
little
black
serpents
of
fear
shot
warningly
across
this
brighter
background
of
his
hopes
then
he
was
aware
that
miriam
had
crossed
the
room
and
stood
beside
him
for
her
delicate
and
natural
perfume
announced
her
even
before
he
turned
and
saw
her
soft
eyes
shining
conveyed
an
irresistible
appeal
and
with
her
came
the
sense
of
peace
she
always
brought
she
was
the
one
thing
at
that
moment
that
could
comfort
and
he
opened
his
arms
to
her
and
let
her
come
nestling
in
against
him
both
hands
finding
their
way
up
under
the
lapels
of
his
coat
all
the
exquisite
confidence
of
the
innocent
child
in
her
look
her
hair
came
over
his
lips
and
face
like
flowers
but
he
did
not
kiss
her
nor
could
he
find
any
words
to
say
to
hold
her
there
was
enough
for
the
touch
of
her
healed
and
blessed
him
so
now
you
have
seen
her
as
she
really
is
he
heard
her
voice
against
his
shoulder
you
have
heard
her
true
name
and
seen
a
little
of
its
form
and
color
i
never
guessed
that
in
this
world
he
stammered
then
instead
of
completing
the
sentence
held
her
more
tightly
to
him
and
let
his
face
sink
deeper
into
the
garden
of
her
hair
oh
yes
she
answered
and
then
peered
up
with
unflinching
look
into
his
eyes
for
that
is
just
how
i
see
you
too
bright
splendid
and
eternal
miriam
it
was
as
unexpected
as
a
ghost
and
as
incredible
me
of
course
you
see
i
know
your
true
name
i
see
you
as
you
are
within
something
came
to
steady
his
swimming
brain
but
it
was
only
after
a
distinct
effort
that
he
realized
it
was
the
voice
of
skale
addressing
him
then
gradually
as
he
listened
gently
releasing
the
girl
in
order
to
turn
towards
him
he
understood
that
what
he
had
witnessed
had
been
in
the
nature
of
a
test
one
of
those
tests
he
had
been
warned
would
come
and
that
his
attitude
to
it
was
regarded
by
the
clergyman
with
approval
it
was
a
test
more
subtle
than
you
know
perhaps
spinrobin
he
was
saying
and
the
feelings
it
has
roused
in
you
are
an
adequate
proof
that
you
have
come
well
through
it
as
i
knew
you
would
as
i
knew
you
would
he
added
with
evident
satisfaction
they
do
infinite
credit
both
to
yourself
and
to
our
judgment
in
er
accepting
you
a
wave
of
singular
emotion
seemed
to
pass
across
the
room
from
one
to
the
other
that
catching
the
breathless
secretary
in
its
tide
filled
him
with
a
high
pride
that
he
had
been
weighed
and
found
worthy
then
left
him
cold
with
a
sudden
reaction
as
he
realized
after
some
delay
the
import
of
the
words
skale
was
next
saying
to
him
chapter
v
and
now
you
shall
hear
your
own
name
called
boomed
the
clergyman
with
enthusiasm
and
realize
the
beauty
and
importance
of
your
own
note
in
the
music
of
life
and
while
spinrobin
trembled
from
head
to
toe
skale
bore
down
upon
him
and
laid
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
he
looked
up
into
the
luminous
eyes
his
glance
next
wandered
down
the
ridge
of
that
masterful
nose
and
lost
itself
among
the
flowing
strands
of
the
tangled
beard
at
that
moment
it
would
hardly
have
surprised
him
to
see
the
big
visage
disappear
and
to
hear
the
sound
of
which
it
was
the
visible
form
slip
into
his
ears
with
a
roar
but
side
by
side
with
the
vague
terror
of
the
unknown
he
was
conscious
also
of
a
smaller
and
more
personal
pang
for
a
man
may
envy
other
forms
yet
keenly
resent
the
possible
loss
or
alteration
of
his
own
and
he
remembered
the
withered
arm
and
the
deafness
but
he
faltered
yet
ashamed
of
his
want
of
courage
i
do
want
to
lose
my
present
shape
or
come
back
without
have
no
fear
exclaimed
the
other
with
decision
miriam
and
myself
have
not
been
experimenting
in
vain
these
three
weeks
we
have
found
your
name
we
know
it
accurately
for
we
are
all
one
chord
and
as
i
promised
you
there
is
no
risk
he
stopped
lowering
his
voice
and
taking
the
secretary
by
the
arm
with
a
fatherly
and
possessive
gesture
spinrobin
he
whispered
solemnly
you
shall
learn
the
value
and
splendor
of
your
self
in
the
melody
of
the
universe
that
burst
of
divine
music
you
shall
understand
how
closely
linked
you
are
to
myself
and
mawle
but
closest
of
all
to
miriam
for
miriam
herself
shall
call
your
name
and
you
shall
hear
so
little
miriam
was
to
prove
his
executioner
or
his
redeemer
that
was
somehow
another
matter
the
awe
with
which
these
experiments
of
skale
inspired
him
ebbed
considerably
as
he
turned
and
saw
the
appealing
wistful
expression
of
his
other
examiner
brave
as
a
lion
he
felt
yet
timid
as
a
hare
there
was
no
idea
of
real
resistance
in
him
any
longer
i
ready
then
he
said
faintly
and
the
girl
came
up
softly
to
his
side
and
sought
his
face
with
a
frank
innocence
of
gaze
that
made
no
attempt
to
hide
her
eagerness
and
joy
she
accepted
the
duty
with
delight
proudly
conscious
of
its
importance
i
know
thee
by
name
and
thou
art
mine
she
murmured
taking
his
hand
it
makes
me
happy
yet
afraid
he
replied
in
her
ear
returning
the
caress
and
at
that
moment
the
clergyman
who
had
gone
to
fetch
his
violin
returned
into
the
room
with
a
suddenness
that
made
them
both
start
for
the
first
time
very
slightly
with
the
first
sign
of
that
modesty
which
comes
with
knowledge
he
had
yet
noticed
in
her
or
felt
conscious
of
in
himself
she
withdrew
a
wonderful
flush
tinging
her
pale
skin
then
passing
instantly
away
to
make
you
feel
absolutely
safe
from
possible
disaster
skale
was
saying
with
a
smile
you
shall
have
the
assistance
of
the
violin
the
pitch
and
rhythm
shall
be
thus
assured
there
is
nothing
to
fear
and
miriam
equally
smiling
with
confidence
led
her
friend
perplexed
and
entangled
as
he
was
by
the
whole
and
confusing
puzzle
led
him
to
the
armchair
she
had
just
vacated
and
then
seated
herself
at
his
feet
upon
a
high
footstool
and
stared
into
his
eyes
with
a
sweet
and
irresistible
directness
of
gaze
that
at
once
increased
both
his
sense
of
bewilderment
and
his
confidence
first
you
must
speak
my
name
she
said
gently
yet
with
a
note
of
authority
so
that
i
may
get
the
note
of
your
voice
into
myself
once
or
twice
will
do
he
obeyed
miriam
miriam
miriam
he
said
and
watched
the
tiny
reflection
of
his
own
face
in
her
eyes
her
the
same
moment
he
began
to
lose
himself
the
girl
lips
were
moving
she
had
picked
up
his
voice
and
merged
her
own
with
it
so
that
when
he
ceased
speaking
her
tones
took
up
the
note
continuously
there
was
no
break
she
carried
on
the
sound
that
he
had
started
and
at
the
same
moment
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
perceived
that
the
violin
had
left
its
case
and
was
under
the
clergyman
beard
the
bow
undulated
like
a
silver
snake
drawing
forth
long
low
notes
that
flowed
about
the
room
and
set
the
air
into
rhythmical
vibrations
these
vibrations
too
carried
on
the
same
sound
spinrobin
gave
a
little
uncontrollable
jump
he
felt
as
if
he
had
uttered
his
own
and
that
this
instrument
proclaimed
the
sentence
then
the
feeling
of
dread
lessened
as
he
heard
skale
voice
mingling
with
the
violin
combining
exquisitely
with
the
he
was
playing
on
the
two
lower
strings
for
the
music
as
the
saying
is
went
through
him
with
thrills
of
power
that
plunged
into
unknown
depths
of
his
soul
and
lifted
him
with
a
delightful
sense
of
inner
expansion
to
a
state
where
fear
was
merged
in
joy
for
some
minutes
the
voice
of
miriam
murmuring
so
close
before
him
that
he
could
feel
her
very
breath
was
caught
in
the
greater
volume
of
the
violin
and
bass
then
suddenly
both
skale
and
violin
ceased
together
and
he
heard
her
voice
emerge
alone
with
a
little
rush
like
that
of
a
singing
flame
it
dropped
down
on
to
the
syllables
of
his
name
his
ugly
and
ridiculous
outer
and
ordinary
name
robertspinrobin
robertspinrobin
he
heard
and
the
sound
flowed
and
poured
about
his
ears
like
the
murmur
of
a
stream
through
summer
fields
and
almost
immediately
with
it
there
came
over
him
a
sense
of
profound
peace
and
security
very
soon
too
he
lost
the
sound
itself
did
not
hear
it
as
sound
for
it
grew
too
vast
and
enveloping
the
sight
of
miriam
face
also
he
lost
he
grew
too
close
to
her
to
see
her
as
object
both
hearing
and
sight
merged
into
something
more
intimate
than
either
he
and
the
girl
were
together
one
consciousness
yet
two
aspects
of
that
one
consciousness
they
were
two
notes
singing
together
in
the
same
chord
and
he
had
lost
his
little
personality
only
to
find
it
again
increased
and
redeemed
in
an
existence
that
was
larger
it
seemed
to
spinrobin
for
there
is
only
his
limited
phraseology
to
draw
from
that
the
incantation
of
her
singing
tones
inserted
itself
between
the
particles
of
his
flesh
and
separated
them
ran
with
his
blood
covered
his
skin
with
velvet
flowed
and
purred
in
the
very
texture
of
his
mind
and
thoughts
something
in
him
swam
melted
fused
his
inner
kingdom
became
most
gloriously
extended
his
soul
loosened
then
began
to
soar
while
something
at
the
heart
of
him
that
had
hitherto
been
congealed
now
turned
fluid
and
alive
he
was
light
as
air
swift
as
fire
his
thoughts
too
underwent
a
change
rose
and
fell
with
the
larger
rhythm
of
new
life
as
the
sound
played
upon
them
somewhat
as
wind
may
rouse
the
leaves
of
a
tree
or
call
upon
the
surface
of
a
deep
sea
to
follow
it
in
waves
terror
was
nowhere
in
his
sensations
but
wonder
beauty
and
delight
ran
calling
to
one
another
from
one
wave
to
the
next
as
this
tide
of
sound
moved
potently
in
the
depths
of
his
awakening
higher
consciousness
the
little
reactions
of
ordinary
life
spun
away
from
him
into
nothingness
as
he
listened
to
a
volume
of
sound
that
was
oceanic
in
power
and
of
an
infinite
splendor
the
creative
sound
by
which
god
first
called
him
into
form
and
being
the
true
inner
name
of
his
soul
yet
he
no
longer
consciously
listened
no
longer
perhaps
consciously
heard
the
name
of
the
soul
can
sound
only
in
the
soul
where
no
speech
is
nor
any
need
for
such
stammering
symbols
spinrobin
for
the
first
time
knew
his
true
name
and
that
was
enough
it
is
impossible
to
translate
into
precise
language
this
torrent
of
exquisite
sensation
that
the
girl
voice
awakened
in
the
secret
chambers
of
his
imagination
spinrobin
found
the
perhaps
that
clothed
it
with
intelligible
description
for
himself
but
in
speaking
of
it
to
others
he
becomes
simply
and
talks
a
kind
of
hearty
nonsense
for
the
truth
probably
is
that
only
poetry
or
music
can
convey
any
portion
of
a
mystical
illumination
otherwise
hopelessly
incommunicable
the
outer
name
had
acted
as
a
conductor
to
the
inner
name
beyond
it
filled
the
room
and
filled
some
far
vaster
space
that
opened
out
above
the
room
about
the
house
above
the
earth
yet
at
the
same
time
was
deep
deep
down
within
his
own
self
he
passed
beyond
the
confines
of
the
world
into
those
sweet
haunted
gardens
where
cherubim
and
seraphim
vast
forces
continually
do
sing
it
floated
him
off
his
feet
as
a
rising
tide
overtakes
the
little
and
floats
them
into
its
own
greatness
and
on
the
tranquil
bosom
of
these
giant
swells
he
rose
into
a
state
that
was
too
calm
to
be
ecstasy
yet
too
glorious
to
be
mere
exaltation
and
as
his
own
little
note
of
personal
aspiration
soared
with
this
vaster
music
to
which
it
belonged
he
felt
mounting
out
of
himself
into
a
condition
where
at
last
he
was
alive
complete
and
splendidly
important
his
sense
of
insignificance
fled
his
ordinary
petty
and
unvalued
self
dropped
away
flake
by
flake
and
he
realized
something
of
the
essential
majesty
of
his
own
real
being
as
part
of
an
eternal
and
wonderful
whole
the
little
painful
throb
of
his
own
limited
personality
slipped
into
the
giant
of
a
universal
vibration
in
his
normal
daily
life
of
course
he
lost
sight
of
this
whole
blinded
by
the
details
seen
without
perspective
mistaking
his
little
personality
for
all
there
was
of
him
but
now
as
he
rose
whirling
soaring
singing
in
the
body
of
this
stupendous
music
he
understood
with
a
rush
of
indescribable
glory
that
he
was
part
and
parcel
of
this
great
chord
this
particular
chord
in
which
skale
mawle
and
miriam
also
sang
their
harmonious
existences
that
this
chord
again
was
part
of
a
vaster
music
still
and
that
all
in
the
last
resort
was
a
single
note
in
the
divine
utterance
of
god
that
is
the
little
secretary
for
the
first
time
in
his
existence
saw
life
as
a
whole
and
interpreted
the
vision
so
wondrous
sweet
and
simple
with
the
analogies
of
sound
communicated
to
his
subliminal
mind
by
the
mighty
skale
whatever
the
cause
however
the
fine
thing
was
that
he
saw
heard
knew
he
was
of
value
in
the
scheme
in
future
he
could
pipe
his
little
lay
without
despair
moreover
with
a
merciless
clarity
of
vision
he
perceived
an
even
deeper
side
of
truth
and
understood
that
the
temporary
discords
were
necessary
just
as
evil
is
necessary
for
the
greater
final
perfection
of
the
whole
for
it
came
to
him
with
the
clear
simplicity
of
a
child
vision
that
the
process
of
attuning
his
being
to
the
right
note
must
inevitably
involve
suffering
and
pain
the
awful
stretching
of
the
string
the
strain
of
the
lifting
vibrations
the
stress
at
first
of
sounding
in
harmony
with
all
the
others
and
the
apparent
loss
of
own
little
note
in
order
to
do
so
this
point
he
reached
it
seems
and
grasped
afterwards
however
he
entered
a
state
where
he
heard
things
no
man
can
utter
because
no
language
can
touch
transcendental
things
without
confining
or
destroying
them
in
attempting
a
version
of
them
he
merely
becomes
unintelligible
as
has
been
said
yet
the
mere
memory
of
it
brings
tears
to
his
blue
eyes
when
he
tries
to
speak
of
it
and
miriam
who
became
of
course
his
chief
confidant
invariably
took
it
upon
herself
to
stop
his
futile
efforts
with
a
kiss
so
at
length
the
tide
of
sound
began
to
ebb
the
volume
lessened
and
grew
distant
and
he
found
himself
regretfully
abruptly
sinking
back
into
what
by
comparison
was
mere
noise
first
he
became
conscious
that
he
listened
heard
saw
then
that
miriam
voice
still
uttered
his
name
softly
but
his
ordinary
outer
name
robertspinrobin
that
he
noticed
her
big
grey
eyes
gazing
into
his
own
and
her
lips
moving
to
frame
the
syllables
and
finally
that
he
was
sitting
in
the
armchair
trembling
joy
peace
wonder
still
coursed
through
him
like
flames
but
dying
flames
skale
voice
next
reached
him
from
the
end
of
the
room
he
saw
the
fireplace
his
own
bright
and
pointed
pumps
the
tea
table
where
they
had
drunk
tea
and
then
as
the
clergyman
strode
towards
him
over
the
carpet
he
looked
up
faint
with
the
farewell
of
the
awful
excitement
into
his
face
the
great
passion
of
the
experience
still
glowed
and
shone
in
him
like
a
furnace
and
there
in
that
masterful
bearded
visage
he
surprised
an
expression
so
tender
so
winning
so
comprehending
that
spinrobin
rose
to
his
feet
and
taking
miriam
by
the
hand
went
to
meet
him
there
the
three
of
them
stood
upon
the
mat
before
the
fire
he
felt
overwhelmingly
drawn
to
the
personality
of
the
man
who
had
revealed
to
him
such
splendid
things
and
in
his
mind
stirred
a
keen
and
poignant
regret
that
such
knowledge
could
not
be
permanent
and
universal
instead
of
merely
a
heavenly
dream
in
the
mind
of
each
separate
percipient
gratitude
and
love
unknown
to
him
before
rose
in
his
soul
spinrobin
his
heart
bursting
as
with
flames
had
cried
aloud
you
have
called
me
by
my
name
and
i
am
free
you
have
named
me
truly
and
i
am
redeemed
and
all
manner
of
speech
was
about
to
follow
when
skale
suddenly
moved
to
one
side
and
raised
his
arm
he
pointed
to
the
mirror
spinrobin
was
just
tall
enough
to
see
his
own
face
in
the
glass
but
the
glimpse
he
caught
made
him
stand
instantly
on
tiptoe
to
see
more
for
his
round
little
countenance
flushed
as
it
was
beneath
its
fringe
of
disordered
feathery
hair
was
literally
transfigured
a
glory
similar
to
the
glory
he
had
seen
that
same
evening
upon
the
face
of
the
housekeeper
still
shone
and
flickered
about
the
eyes
and
forehead
the
signature
of
the
soul
brilliant
in
purity
lay
there
transforming
the
insignificance
of
the
features
with
the
grandeur
and
nobility
of
its
own
power
i
am
honored
too
gloriously
honored
was
the
singular
cry
that
escaped
his
lips
vainly
seeking
words
to
express
an
emotion
of
the
unknown
i
am
honored
as
the
sun
and
as
the
stars
and
so
fierce
was
the
tide
of
emotion
that
rose
within
him
at
the
sight
so
strong
the
sense
of
gratitude
to
the
man
and
girl
who
had
shown
him
how
his
true
self
might
contain
so
great
a
glory
that
he
turned
with
a
cry
like
that
of
a
child
bewildered
by
the
loss
of
some
incomprehensible
happiness
turned
and
flung
himself
first
upon
the
breast
of
the
big
clergyman
and
then
into
the
open
arms
of
the
radiant
miriam
with
sobs
and
tears
of
wonder
that
absolutely
refused
to
be
restrained
chapter
vi
i
the
situation
at
this
point
of
his
amazing
adventure
seems
to
have
been
that
the
fear
spinrobin
felt
about
the
nature
of
the
final
experiment
was
met
and
equalized
by
his
passionate
curiosity
regarding
it
had
these
been
the
only
two
forces
at
work
the
lightest
pressure
in
either
direction
would
have
brought
him
to
a
decision
he
would
have
accepted
the
challenge
and
stayed
or
he
would
have
hesitated
shirked
and
left
there
was
however
another
force
at
work
upon
which
he
had
hardly
calculated
at
the
beginning
and
that
force
now
came
into
full
operation
and
controlled
his
decision
with
margin
and
to
spare
he
loved
miriam
and
even
had
he
not
loved
her
it
is
probable
that
her
own
calm
courage
would
have
put
him
to
shame
and
made
him
face
the
music
he
could
no
more
have
deserted
her
than
he
could
have
deserted
himself
the
die
was
cast
moreover
if
the
certainty
that
skale
was
trafficking
in
dangerous
and
unlawful
knowledge
was
formidable
enough
to
terrify
him
for
miriam
at
least
it
held
nothing
alarming
she
had
no
qualms
knew
no
uneasiness
she
looked
forward
to
the
end
with
calmness
even
with
joy
just
as
ordinary
good
folk
look
forward
to
a
heaven
beyond
death
for
she
had
never
known
any
other
ideal
skale
to
her
was
father
mother
and
god
he
had
brought
her
up
during
all
the
twenty
years
of
her
life
in
this
solitude
among
the
mountains
choosing
her
reading
providing
her
companionship
training
her
with
the
one
end
in
view
of
carrying
out
his
immense
and
purpose
she
had
never
dreamed
of
any
other
end
and
had
been
so
drilled
with
the
idea
that
this
life
was
but
a
tedious
for
a
worthier
state
to
come
that
she
looked
forward
naturally
enough
with
confidence
and
relief
to
the
great
experiment
that
should
bring
her
release
she
knew
vaguely
that
there
was
a
certain
awful
danger
involved
but
it
never
for
one
instant
occurred
to
her
that
skale
could
fail
and
so
far
spinrobin
had
let
no
breath
of
his
own
terror
reach
her
or
attempted
ever
to
put
into
her
calm
mind
the
least
suggestion
that
the
experiment
might
fail
and
call
down
upon
them
the
implacable
and
destructive
forces
that
could
ruin
them
body
and
soul
forever
for
this
plainly
expressed
was
the
form
in
which
his
terror
attacked
him
when
he
thought
about
it
skale
was
tempting
the
olympian
powers
to
crush
him
it
was
about
this
time
however
as
has
been
seen
from
a
slight
incident
in
the
last
chapter
that
a
change
began
to
steal
at
first
imperceptibly
then
obviously
over
their
relations
together
spinrobin
had
been
in
the
house
three
weeks
far
longer
no
doubt
than
any
of
the
other
candidates
there
only
remained
now
the
final
big
tests
the
preliminary
ones
were
successfully
passed
miriam
knew
that
very
soon
the
moment
would
come
for
him
to
stay
or
go
and
it
was
in
all
probability
this
reflection
that
helped
her
to
make
certain
discoveries
in
herself
that
at
first
she
did
not
in
the
least
understand
spinrobin
however
understood
perfectly
his
own
heart
made
him
intuitive
enough
for
that
and
the
first
signs
thrilled
and
moved
him
prodigiously
his
account
of
it
all
is
like
no
love
story
that
has
ever
been
heard
for
in
the
first
place
this
singular
girl
hardly
breathed
about
her
the
reality
of
an
actual
world
she
had
known
nothing
beyond
the
simple
life
in
this
hollow
of
the
hills
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
the
portentous
conceptions
that
peopled
the
region
of
dream
revealed
by
the
clergyman
and
in
the
second
place
she
had
no
standards
but
her
own
instincts
to
judge
by
for
mawle
in
spite
of
her
devotion
to
the
girl
suffered
under
too
great
disabilities
to
fill
the
place
of
a
mother
while
skale
was
too
lost
in
his
vast
speculations
to
guide
her
except
in
a
few
general
matters
and
too
sure
of
her
at
the
same
time
to
reflect
that
she
might
ever
need
detailed
guidance
her
exceedingly
natural
and
wholesome
on
the
one
hand
and
her
own
native
purity
and
good
sense
on
the
other
however
led
her
fairly
straight
while
the
fact
that
spinrobin
with
his
modesty
and
his
fine
aspirations
was
a
little
gentleman
into
the
bargain
ensured
that
no
unlawful
temptation
should
be
placed
in
her
way
or
undue
pressure
based
upon
her
ignorance
employed
ii
they
were
coming
down
one
afternoon
from
the
mountains
soon
after
the
test
of
calling
his
name
and
they
were
alone
the
clergyman
being
engaged
upon
some
mysterious
business
that
had
kept
him
out
of
sight
all
day
they
did
not
talk
much
but
they
were
happy
in
each
other
company
spinrobin
more
than
happy
much
of
the
time
when
the
ground
allowed
they
went
along
hand
in
hand
like
children
miriam
he
had
asked
on
the
top
of
the
moors
did
i
ever
tell
you
about
winky
my
little
friend
winky
and
she
had
looked
up
with
a
smile
and
shaken
her
head
but
i
like
the
name
she
added
i
should
like
to
hear
please
and
he
told
her
how
as
a
boy
he
had
invoked
various
folk
to
tease
his
sister
of
whom
winky
was
chief
but
in
telling
the
story
he
somehow
or
other
always
referred
to
the
little
person
by
name
and
never
once
revealed
his
sex
he
told
too
how
he
sat
all
night
on
the
lawn
outside
his
sister
window
to
intercept
the
expected
visit
winky
she
said
speaking
rather
low
is
a
true
name
of
course
you
really
created
winky
called
winky
into
being
for
to
her
now
this
seemed
as
true
and
possible
as
it
had
seemed
to
himself
at
the
age
of
ten
oh
i
really
loved
winky
he
replied
enthusiastically
and
was
at
the
same
moment
surprised
to
feel
her
draw
away
her
hand
winky
lived
for
years
in
my
very
heart
and
the
next
thing
he
knew
after
a
brief
silence
between
them
was
that
he
heard
a
sob
and
no
attempt
to
smother
it
either
in
less
than
a
second
he
was
beside
her
and
had
both
her
hands
in
his
he
understood
in
a
flash
you
precious
baby
he
cried
but
winky
was
a
little
man
he
was
a
girl
she
looked
up
through
her
tears
oh
but
how
wonderful
her
grey
eyes
were
through
tears
and
made
him
stand
still
before
her
and
repeat
his
sentence
and
she
said
i
know
it
true
but
i
like
to
hear
you
say
it
and
that
why
i
asked
you
to
repeat
it
miriam
he
said
to
her
softly
kneeling
down
on
the
heather
at
her
feet
there
only
one
name
in
my
heart
i
can
tell
you
that
i
heard
it
sing
and
sing
the
moment
i
came
into
this
house
the
very
instant
i
first
saw
you
in
that
dark
passage
i
knew
perfectly
well
ages
and
ages
ago
that
one
day
a
girl
with
your
name
would
come
singing
into
my
life
to
make
me
complete
and
happy
but
i
never
believed
that
she
would
look
as
beautiful
as
you
are
he
kissed
the
two
hands
he
held
or
that
she
would
would
think
of
me
as
you
do
he
stammered
in
his
passion
and
then
miriam
smiling
down
on
him
through
her
tears
bent
and
kissed
his
feathery
hair
and
immediately
after
was
on
her
knees
in
front
of
him
among
the
heather
i
own
you
she
said
quite
simply
i
know
your
name
and
you
know
mine
whatever
happens
but
spinrobin
was
too
happy
to
hear
any
more
and
putting
both
arms
round
her
neck
he
kissed
the
rest
of
her
words
away
into
silence
and
in
the
very
middle
of
this
it
was
that
the
girl
gently
but
very
firmly
pushed
him
from
her
and
spinrobin
in
the
delicacy
of
his
mind
understood
that
for
the
first
time
in
her
curious
buried
life
the
primitive
instincts
had
awakened
so
that
she
knew
herself
a
woman
and
a
woman
moreover
who
loved
thus
caught
in
a
bewildering
network
of
curiosity
fear
wonder
and
love
spinrobin
stayed
on
and
decided
further
that
should
the
clergyman
approve
him
he
would
not
leave
yet
his
intimate
relations
now
with
miriam
instead
of
making
it
easier
for
him
to
learn
the
facts
made
it
on
the
other
hand
more
difficult
for
he
could
not
of
course
make
use
of
her
affection
to
learn
secrets
that
skale
did
not
yet
wish
him
to
know
and
further
he
had
no
desire
to
be
disloyal
either
to
him
none
the
less
he
was
sorely
tempted
to
ask
her
what
the
final
experiment
was
and
what
the
rooms
contained
and
most
of
all
what
the
great
name
was
they
were
finally
to
utter
by
means
of
the
human
chord
the
emotions
playing
about
him
at
this
time
however
were
too
complicated
and
too
violent
to
enable
him
to
form
a
proper
judgment
of
the
whole
affair
it
seems
indeed
that
this
calmer
adjudication
never
came
to
him
at
all
for
even
to
this
day
the
mere
mention
of
the
clergyman
name
brings
to
his
round
cheeks
a
flush
of
that
enthusiasm
and
wonder
which
are
the
enemies
of
all
sober
discrimination
skale
still
remains
the
great
battering
force
of
his
life
that
carried
him
off
his
feet
towards
the
stars
and
sent
his
imagination
with
wings
of
fire
tearing
through
the
unknown
to
a
goal
that
once
attained
should
make
them
all
four
as
gods
chapter
vii
i
and
thus
the
affair
moved
nearer
to
its
close
the
theory
and
practice
of
molding
form
by
means
of
sound
was
the
next
bang
at
his
mind
delivered
in
the
clergyman
most
convincing
manner
and
in
view
of
the
proofs
that
soon
followed
an
experience
that
seemed
to
dislocate
the
very
foundations
of
his
visible
world
deemed
hitherto
secure
enough
at
least
to
stand
on
had
it
all
consisted
merely
of
talk
on
skale
part
the
secretary
would
have
known
better
what
to
think
it
was
the
interludes
of
practical
proof
that
sent
his
judgment
so
awry
these
definite
sensible
results
sandwiched
in
between
all
the
visionary
explanation
left
him
utterly
at
sea
he
could
not
reconcile
them
altogether
with
hypnotism
he
could
only
as
an
ordinary
man
already
with
a
bias
in
the
mystical
direction
come
to
the
one
conclusion
that
this
overwhelming
and
hierophantic
man
was
actually
in
touch
with
cisterns
of
force
so
terrific
as
to
be
dangerous
to
what
he
had
hitherto
understood
to
be
life
it
was
easy
enough
for
the
clergyman
in
his
optimistic
enthusiasm
to
talk
about
their
leading
to
a
larger
life
but
what
if
the
experiment
failed
and
these
colossal
powers
ran
amok
upon
the
world
and
upon
the
invokers
moreover
chief
anxiety
of
all
what
was
this
name
to
be
experimented
with
what
was
the
nature
of
this
force
that
skale
hoped
to
invoke
so
mighty
that
it
should
make
them
as
gods
so
terrible
that
a
chord
alone
could
compass
even
the
first
of
its
stupendous
syllables
and
further
he
was
still
haunted
with
the
feeling
that
other
beings
occupied
certain
portions
of
the
rambling
mansion
and
more
than
once
recently
he
had
wakened
in
the
night
with
an
idea
carried
over
from
dreams
possibly
that
the
corridor
outside
his
bedroom
was
moving
and
alive
with
footsteps
from
dreams
possibly
for
when
he
went
and
peered
shivering
through
the
narrow
crack
of
the
door
he
saw
nothing
unusual
and
another
time
he
was
awake
beyond
question
at
the
moment
for
he
had
been
reading
till
two
and
had
but
just
extinguished
the
candle
he
had
heard
a
sound
that
he
found
impossible
to
describe
but
that
sent
all
the
blood
with
a
swift
rush
from
the
region
of
his
heart
it
was
not
wind
it
was
not
the
wood
cracking
with
the
frost
it
was
not
snow
sliding
from
the
slates
outside
it
was
something
that
simultaneously
filled
the
entire
building
yet
sounded
particularly
loud
just
outside
his
door
and
it
came
with
the
abrupt
suddenness
of
a
report
it
made
him
think
of
all
the
air
in
the
rooms
and
halls
and
passages
being
withdrawn
by
immense
suction
as
though
a
gigantic
dome
had
been
dropped
over
the
building
in
order
to
produce
a
vacuum
and
just
after
it
he
heard
unmistakably
the
long
soft
stride
of
skale
going
past
his
door
and
down
the
whole
length
of
the
corridor
stealthily
very
quickly
with
the
hurry
of
anxiety
or
alarm
in
his
silence
and
his
speed
this
moreover
had
now
happened
twice
so
that
imagination
seemed
a
explanation
and
on
both
occasions
the
clergyman
had
remained
invisible
on
the
day
following
until
the
evening
and
had
then
reappeared
quiet
and
as
usual
but
with
an
atmosphere
of
immense
vibratory
force
somehow
about
his
person
and
a
glow
in
his
face
and
eyes
that
at
moments
seemed
positively
colored
no
word
of
explanation
however
had
as
yet
been
forthcoming
of
these
omens
and
spinrobin
waited
with
what
patience
he
could
meanwhile
for
the
final
test
which
he
knew
to
be
close
upon
him
and
in
his
diary
the
pages
usually
left
blank
now
because
words
failed
him
he
wrote
a
portion
of
anone
cry
that
had
caught
his
memory
and
expressed
a
little
of
what
he
felt
for
fiery
thoughts
do
shape
themselves
within
me
more
and
more
whereof
i
catch
the
issue
as
i
hear
dead
sounds
at
night
come
from
the
inmost
hills
footsteps
upon
ii
it
was
within
three
days
of
the
expiration
of
his
trial
month
that
he
then
had
this
conversation
with
the
clergyman
which
he
understood
quite
well
was
offered
by
way
of
preparation
for
the
bigger
tests
about
to
come
he
has
reported
what
he
could
of
it
it
seemed
to
him
at
the
time
both
plausible
and
absurd
it
was
of
a
piece
that
is
with
the
rest
of
the
whole
fabulous
adventure
skale
as
they
walked
over
the
snowy
moors
in
the
between
tea
and
dinner
had
been
speaking
to
him
about
the
practical
results
obtainable
by
what
he
already
knew
for
that
matter
and
how
it
is
possible
by
fiddling
long
enough
upon
a
certain
note
to
fiddle
down
a
bridge
and
split
it
asunder
from
that
he
passed
on
to
the
scientific
fact
that
the
ultimate
molecules
of
matter
are
not
only
in
constant
whirring
motion
but
that
also
they
do
not
actually
touch
one
another
the
atoms
composing
the
point
of
a
pin
for
instance
shift
and
change
without
ceasing
and
there
is
space
between
them
then
suddenly
taking
spinrobin
arm
he
came
closer
his
booming
tone
dropping
to
a
whisper
to
change
the
form
of
anything
he
said
in
his
ear
is
merely
to
change
the
arrangement
of
those
dancing
molecules
to
alter
their
rate
of
vibration
his
eyes
even
in
the
obscurity
of
the
dusk
went
across
the
other
face
like
flames
by
means
of
sound
asked
the
other
already
beginning
to
feel
eerie
the
clergyman
nodded
his
great
head
in
acquiescence
just
as
the
vibrations
of
he
said
after
a
pause
can
alter
the
form
of
a
metal
by
melting
it
so
the
vibrations
of
sound
can
alter
the
form
of
a
thing
by
inserting
themselves
between
those
whirling
molecules
and
changing
their
speed
and
arrangement
change
the
outline
that
is
the
idea
seemed
fairly
to
buffet
the
little
secretary
in
the
face
but
skale
proximity
was
too
overpowering
to
permit
of
very
clear
thinking
feeling
that
a
remark
was
expected
from
him
he
managed
to
ejaculate
an
obvious
objection
in
his
mind
but
is
there
any
sound
that
can
produce
vibrations
fine
and
rapid
enough
to
er
accomplish
such
a
result
skale
appeared
almost
to
leap
for
pleasure
as
he
heard
it
in
reality
he
merely
straightened
himself
up
that
he
cried
aloud
to
the
further
astonishment
and
even
alarm
of
his
companion
is
another
part
of
my
discovery
an
essential
particular
of
it
the
production
of
fine
and
rapid
enough
to
alter
shapes
listen
and
i
will
tell
you
he
lowered
his
voice
again
i
have
found
out
that
by
uttering
the
true
inner
name
of
anything
i
can
set
in
motion
harmonics
harmonics
note
well
half
the
wave
length
and
twice
the
frequency
that
are
delicate
and
swift
enough
to
insert
themselves
between
the
whirling
molecules
of
any
reasonable
object
any
object
i
mean
not
too
closely
or
coherently
packed
by
then
swelling
or
lowering
my
voice
i
can
alter
the
scale
size
or
shape
of
that
object
almost
indefinitely
its
parts
nevertheless
retaining
their
normal
relative
proportions
i
can
scatter
it
to
a
huge
scale
by
separating
its
molecules
indefinitely
or
bring
them
so
closely
together
that
the
size
of
the
object
would
be
reduced
to
a
practical
invisibility
the
world
in
fact
gasped
spinrobin
feeling
the
earth
he
knew
slipping
away
under
his
feet
skale
turned
upon
him
and
stood
still
a
moment
the
huge
moors
glimmering
pale
and
unreal
beneath
their
snow
ran
past
them
into
the
sky
silent
forms
corresponding
to
who
knows
what
pedal
notes
the
wind
sighed
audible
expression
of
who
shall
say
what
mighty
shapes
something
of
the
passion
of
sound
with
all
its
mystery
and
splendor
entered
his
heart
in
that
windy
sigh
was
anything
real
was
anything
permanent
were
sound
and
form
merely
interchangeable
symbols
of
some
deeper
uncataloged
reality
and
was
the
visible
cohesion
after
all
the
illusory
thing
the
whole
universe
sir
he
roared
through
the
darkness
in
a
way
that
made
the
other
wish
for
the
touch
of
miriam
hand
to
steady
him
i
could
make
you
my
dear
spinrobin
immense
tiny
invisible
or
by
a
partial
utterance
of
your
name
permanently
crooked
i
could
overwhelm
your
own
vibrations
and
withdraw
their
force
as
by
suction
of
a
vacuum
absorbing
yourself
into
my
own
being
by
uttering
the
name
of
this
old
earth
if
i
knew
it
i
could
alter
its
face
toss
the
forests
like
green
dust
into
the
sea
and
lift
the
pebbles
of
the
seashore
to
the
magnitude
of
moons
or
did
i
know
the
true
name
of
the
sun
i
could
utter
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
identify
myself
with
its
very
being
and
so
escape
the
pitiful
terrors
of
a
limited
personal
existence
he
seized
his
companion
arm
and
began
to
stride
down
the
mountainside
at
a
terrific
pace
almost
lifting
spinrobin
from
his
feet
as
he
did
so
about
the
ears
of
the
panting
secretary
the
wild
words
tore
like
bullets
whistling
a
new
and
dreadful
music
my
dear
fellow
he
shouted
through
the
night
at
the
word
of
power
of
a
true
man
the
nations
would
rush
into
war
or
sink
suddenly
into
eternal
peace
the
mountains
be
moved
into
the
sea
and
the
dead
arise
to
know
the
sounds
behind
the
manifestations
of
nature
the
names
of
mechanical
as
well
as
of
psychical
forces
of
hebrew
angels
as
of
christian
virtues
is
to
know
powers
that
you
can
call
upon
at
will
and
use
utter
them
in
the
true
vibratory
way
and
you
waken
their
counterpart
in
yourself
and
stir
thus
mighty
psychic
powers
into
activity
in
your
soul
he
rained
the
words
down
upon
the
other
head
like
a
tempest
can
you
wonder
that
the
walls
of
jericho
fell
flat
before
a
or
that
the
raging
waves
of
the
sea
lay
still
before
a
voice
that
called
their
name
my
discovery
spinrobin
will
run
through
the
world
like
a
purifying
fire
for
to
utter
the
true
names
of
individuals
families
tribes
and
nations
will
be
to
call
them
to
the
knowledge
of
their
highest
selves
and
to
lift
them
into
tune
with
the
music
of
the
voice
of
god
they
reached
the
front
door
where
the
gleam
of
lamps
shone
with
a
homely
welcome
through
the
glass
panels
the
clergyman
released
his
arm
then
bent
down
towards
him
and
added
in
a
tone
that
held
in
it
for
the
first
time
something
of
the
gravity
of
death
only
remember
that
to
utter
falsely
to
pronounce
incorrectly
to
call
a
name
incompletely
is
the
beginning
of
all
evil
for
it
is
to
lie
with
the
very
soul
it
is
also
to
evoke
forces
without
the
adequate
corresponding
shape
that
covers
and
controls
them
and
to
attract
upon
yourself
the
destructive
qualities
of
these
powers
to
your
own
final
disintegration
and
annihilation
spinrobin
entered
the
house
filled
with
a
sense
of
awe
that
was
cold
and
terrible
and
greater
than
all
his
other
sensations
combined
the
winds
of
fear
and
ruin
blew
shrill
about
his
naked
soul
none
the
less
he
was
steadfast
he
would
remain
to
bless
skale
might
be
violent
in
mind
unbalanced
possibly
mad
but
his
madness
thundered
at
the
doors
of
heaven
and
the
sound
of
that
thundering
completed
the
conquest
of
his
admiration
he
really
believed
that
when
the
end
came
those
mighty
doors
would
actually
open
and
the
thought
woke
a
kind
of
elemental
terror
in
him
that
was
not
of
this
world
yet
marvelously
attractive
iii
that
night
the
singular
rushing
sound
again
disturbed
him
it
seemed
as
before
to
pass
through
the
entire
building
but
this
time
it
included
a
greater
space
in
its
operations
for
he
fancied
he
could
hear
it
outside
the
house
as
well
traveling
far
up
into
the
recesses
of
the
dark
mountains
like
the
sweep
of
immense
draughts
of
air
it
went
down
the
passage
and
rolled
on
into
the
sky
making
him
think
of
the
suggestion
that
some
sounds
might
require
airwaves
of
a
hundred
miles
instead
of
a
few
inches
too
vast
to
be
heard
as
sound
and
shortly
after
it
followed
the
great
gliding
stride
of
skale
himself
down
the
corridor
that
at
least
was
unmistakable
during
the
following
day
moreover
skale
remained
invisible
spinrobin
of
course
had
never
permitted
himself
to
search
the
house
or
even
to
examine
the
other
rooms
in
his
own
corridor
the
quarters
where
miriam
slept
were
equally
unknown
to
him
but
he
was
quite
certain
that
these
prolonged
periods
of
absence
were
spent
by
the
clergyman
in
some
remote
part
of
the
rambling
building
where
there
existed
isolated
if
not
actually
secret
rooms
in
which
he
practiced
the
rituals
of
some
dangerous
and
intrepid
worship
and
these
intimidating
and
mysterious
sounds
at
night
were
of
course
something
to
do
with
the
forces
he
conjured
the
day
was
still
and
windless
the
house
silent
as
the
grave
he
walked
about
the
hills
during
the
afternoon
practicing
his
hebrew
names
and
words
like
a
schoolboy
learning
a
lesson
and
all
about
him
the
slopes
of
mountain
watched
him
listening
so
did
the
sheet
of
snow
shining
in
the
wintry
sunlight
the
clergyman
seemed
to
have
put
all
sound
in
his
pocket
and
taken
it
away
with
him
the
absence
of
anything
approaching
noise
became
almost
oppressive
it
was
a
silence
that
prepares
spinrobin
went
about
on
tiptoe
spoke
to
miriam
in
whispers
practiced
his
names
in
hushed
expectant
tones
he
almost
expected
to
see
the
moors
and
mountains
open
their
deep
sides
and
let
the
sounds
of
which
they
were
the
visible
shape
escape
awfully
about
him
in
these
hours
of
solitude
all
that
skale
had
told
him
and
more
still
that
he
divined
himself
haunted
him
with
a
sense
of
disquieting
reality
inaudible
sounds
of
fearful
volume
invisible
forms
of
monstrous
character
combinations
of
both
even
impended
everywhere
about
him
he
became
afraid
lest
he
might
stumble
as
skale
had
done
on
the
very
note
that
should
release
them
and
bring
them
howling
leaping
crashing
about
his
ears
therefore
he
tried
to
make
himself
as
small
as
possible
he
muffled
steps
and
voice
and
personality
if
he
could
he
would
have
completely
disappeared
he
looked
forward
to
skale
return
but
when
evening
came
he
was
still
alone
and
he
dined
with
miriam
for
the
first
time
and
she
too
he
noticed
was
unusually
quiet
almost
they
seemed
to
have
entered
the
world
of
mawle
the
silent
regions
of
the
deaf
but
for
the
most
part
it
is
probable
that
these
queer
impressions
were
due
to
the
unusual
state
of
spinrobin
imagination
he
knew
that
it
was
his
last
night
in
the
place
unless
the
clergyman
accepted
him
he
knew
also
that
skale
had
absented
himself
with
a
purpose
and
that
the
said
purpose
had
to
do
with
the
test
of
alteration
of
forms
by
sound
which
would
surely
be
upon
him
before
the
sun
rose
so
that
one
way
and
another
it
was
natural
enough
that
his
nerves
should
have
been
somewhat
overtaxed
the
presence
of
miriam
and
mawle
however
did
much
to
soothe
him
the
latter
indeed
mothered
the
pair
of
them
quite
absurdly
smiling
all
the
time
while
she
moved
about
softly
with
the
dishes
and
doing
her
best
to
make
them
eat
enough
for
four
between
courses
she
sat
at
the
end
of
the
room
waiting
in
the
shadows
till
miriam
beckoned
to
her
and
once
or
twice
going
so
far
as
to
put
her
hand
upon
spinrobin
shoulder
protectively
his
own
mind
however
all
the
time
was
full
of
charging
visions
he
kept
thinking
of
the
month
just
past
and
of
the
amazing
changes
it
had
brought
into
his
thoughts
he
realized
too
now
that
skale
was
away
something
of
the
lonely
and
splendid
courage
of
the
man
following
this
terrific
perhaps
mad
ideal
day
in
day
out
week
in
week
out
for
twenty
years
and
more
his
faith
never
weakening
his
belief
undaunted
waves
of
pity
too
invaded
him
for
the
first
time
pity
for
this
sweet
girl
brought
up
in
ignorance
of
any
other
possible
world
pity
for
the
deaf
old
housekeeper
already
partially
broken
and
both
sacrificed
to
the
dominant
idea
of
this
single
enthusiast
pity
last
of
all
for
himself
swept
headlong
before
he
had
time
to
reflect
into
the
audacious
purpose
of
this
violent
and
headstrong
all
manner
of
emotions
stirred
now
this
last
evening
in
his
perplexed
breast
yet
out
of
the
general
turmoil
one
stood
forth
more
clearly
than
the
rest
his
proud
consciousness
that
he
was
taking
an
important
part
in
something
really
big
at
last
behind
the
screen
of
thought
and
emotion
which
veiled
so
puzzlingly
the
truth
he
divined
for
the
first
time
in
his
career
a
golden
splendor
if
it
also
terrified
him
that
was
only
his
cowardice
in
the
same
way
it
might
be
splendid
to
jump
into
niagara
just
above
the
falls
to
snatch
a
passing
flower
that
seemed
more
wonderful
than
any
he
had
seen
before
but
miriam
tomorrow
is
my
last
day
he
said
suddenly
catching
her
grey
eyes
upon
him
in
the
middle
of
his
strange
reflections
tonight
may
be
my
last
night
in
this
house
with
you
the
girl
made
no
reply
merely
looking
up
and
smiling
at
him
but
the
singing
sensation
that
usually
accompanied
her
gaze
was
not
present
that
was
very
nearly
a
discord
she
observed
presently
referring
to
his
remark
it
was
out
of
tune
and
he
realized
with
a
touch
of
shame
what
she
meant
for
it
was
not
true
that
this
was
his
last
evening
he
knew
really
that
he
would
stay
on
and
that
skale
would
accept
him
quick
as
a
flash
with
her
simple
intuition
she
felt
that
he
had
said
this
merely
to
coax
from
her
some
sign
of
sympathy
or
love
and
the
girl
was
not
to
be
drawn
she
knew
quite
well
that
she
held
him
and
that
their
fate
whatever
it
might
be
lay
together
the
gentle
rebuke
made
him
silent
again
they
sat
there
smiling
at
one
another
across
the
table
and
old
mawle
sitting
among
the
shadows
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
her
hands
crossed
in
front
of
her
her
white
evening
cap
shining
like
a
halo
above
her
patient
face
watched
them
also
smiling
the
rest
of
the
strange
meal
passed
without
conversation
for
the
great
silence
that
all
day
had
wrapped
the
hills
seemed
to
have
invaded
the
house
as
well
and
laid
its
spell
upon
every
room
a
deep
hush
listening
and
expectant
dropped
more
and
more
about
the
building
and
about
themselves
after
dinner
they
sat
for
twenty
minutes
together
before
the
library
fire
their
toes
upon
the
fender
for
contrary
to
her
habit
miriam
had
not
vanished
at
once
to
her
own
quarters
we
not
alone
here
remarked
spinrobin
presently
in
a
low
voice
and
she
nodded
her
head
to
signify
agreement
the
presence
of
skale
when
he
was
in
the
house
but
invisible
was
often
more
real
and
tremendous
than
when
he
stood
beside
them
and
thundered
some
part
of
him
some
emanation
some
potent
psychic
messenger
from
his
personality
kept
them
closely
company
and
tonight
the
secretary
felt
it
very
vividly
his
remark
was
really
another
effort
to
keep
in
close
touch
with
miriam
even
in
thought
he
needed
her
more
than
ever
in
this
sea
of
silence
that
was
gathering
everywhere
about
him
gulf
upon
gulf
it
rose
and
folded
over
him
his
anxiety
became
every
moment
more
acute
and
those
black
serpents
of
fear
that
he
dreaded
were
not
very
far
away
by
every
fiber
in
his
being
he
felt
certain
that
a
test
which
should
shake
the
very
foundations
of
his
psychical
life
was
slowly
and
remorselessly
approaching
him
yet
though
he
longed
to
speak
outright
and
demand
of
miriam
what
she
knew
and
especially
that
she
should
reveal
the
place
of
the
concealment
and
what
portent
it
was
that
required
all
this
dread
and
muted
atmosphere
for
its
preparation
he
kept
a
seal
upon
his
lips
realizing
that
loyalty
forbade
and
that
the
knowledge
of
her
contempt
would
be
even
worse
than
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
and
so
in
due
course
she
rose
to
go
and
as
he
opened
the
door
for
her
into
the
hall
she
paused
a
moment
and
turned
towards
him
a
sudden
inexplicable
thrill
flashed
through
him
as
she
turned
her
eyes
upon
his
face
for
he
thought
at
first
she
was
about
to
speak
he
has
never
forgotten
the
picture
as
she
stood
there
so
close
to
his
side
the
lamplight
on
her
slim
figure
in
its
white
silk
blouse
and
neat
dark
skirt
the
gloom
of
the
unlit
hall
and
staircase
beyond
stood
there
an
instant
then
put
both
her
arms
about
his
neck
drew
him
down
to
her
and
kissed
him
gently
on
both
cheeks
twice
she
kissed
him
then
was
gone
into
the
darkness
so
softly
that
he
scarcely
heard
her
steps
and
he
stood
between
the
shadows
and
the
light
her
perfume
still
lingering
and
with
it
the
sweet
and
magical
blessing
that
she
left
behind
for
that
caress
he
understood
was
the
innocent
childlike
caress
of
their
first
days
and
with
all
the
power
of
her
loving
little
soul
in
it
she
had
given
him
the
message
that
he
craved
courage
and
keep
a
brave
heart
dear
spinny
chapter
viii
i
spinrobin
lingered
a
while
in
the
library
after
miriam
was
gone
then
feeling
slightly
ill
at
ease
in
the
room
now
that
her
presence
was
withdrawn
put
the
lights
out
saw
that
the
windows
were
properly
barred
and
fastened
and
went
into
the
hall
on
his
way
to
bed
he
looked
at
the
front
door
tried
the
chain
and
made
sure
that
both
top
and
bottom
bolts
were
thrown
why
he
should
have
taken
these
somewhat
unusual
precautions
was
not
far
to
seek
though
at
the
moment
he
could
not
probably
have
explained
the
desire
for
protection
was
awake
in
his
being
and
he
took
these
measures
of
security
and
defense
because
it
sought
to
express
itself
as
it
were
even
automatically
spinrobin
was
afraid
up
the
broad
staircase
he
went
softly
with
his
lighted
candle
leaving
the
great
hall
behind
him
full
to
the
brim
with
shadows
shadows
that
moved
and
took
shape
his
own
head
and
shoulders
in
monstrous
outline
poured
over
the
walls
and
upper
landings
and
thence
leaped
to
the
skylight
overhead
as
he
passed
the
turn
in
the
stairs
the
dark
contents
of
the
hall
below
rushed
past
in
a
single
mass
like
an
immense
extended
wing
and
settled
abruptly
at
his
back
following
him
thence
to
the
landing
once
there
he
went
more
quickly
moving
on
tiptoe
and
so
reached
his
own
room
halfway
down
he
passed
two
doors
to
get
there
another
two
lay
beyond
all
four
as
he
believed
being
always
locked
it
was
these
four
rooms
that
conjured
mightily
with
his
imagination
always
for
these
were
the
rooms
he
pictured
to
himself
though
without
a
vestige
of
proof
as
being
occupied
it
was
from
the
further
ones
one
or
other
of
them
he
believed
skale
came
when
he
had
passed
down
the
corridor
at
two
in
the
morning
stealthily
hurriedly
on
the
heels
of
that
rush
of
sound
that
made
him
shake
in
his
bed
as
he
heard
it
in
his
own
room
however
surrounded
by
the
familiar
and
personal
objects
that
reminded
him
of
normal
life
he
felt
more
at
home
he
undressed
quickly
all
his
candles
alight
and
then
sat
before
the
fire
in
the
armchair
to
read
a
little
before
getting
into
bed
and
he
read
for
choice
hebrew
hebrew
poetry
and
on
this
particular
occasion
the
books
of
job
and
ezekiel
for
nothing
had
so
soothing
and
calming
an
effect
upon
him
as
the
mighty
yet
simple
imagery
of
these
sonorous
stanzas
they
invariably
took
him
out
of
himself
or
at
any
rate
out
of
the
region
of
small
personal
alarms
and
thus
letting
his
fancy
roam
it
seems
he
was
delighted
to
find
that
gradually
the
fears
which
had
dominated
him
during
the
day
and
evening
disappeared
he
passed
with
the
poetry
into
that
region
of
high
adventure
which
his
nature
in
real
life
denied
him
the
verses
uplifted
him
in
a
way
that
made
his
recent
timidity
seem
the
mere
mood
of
a
moment
or
at
least
negligible
his
memory
as
one
thing
suggested
another
began
to
give
up
its
dead
and
some
of
blake
drawings
seen
recently
in
london
with
prodigious
effect
began
to
pass
vividly
before
his
mental
vision
the
symbolism
of
what
he
was
reading
doubtless
suggested
the
memory
he
felt
himself
caught
in
the
great
invisible
nets
of
wonder
that
forever
swept
the
world
the
littleness
of
modern
life
compared
to
that
ancient
and
profound
spirit
which
sought
the
permanent
things
of
the
soul
haunted
him
with
curious
insistence
he
suffered
a
keen
though
somewhat
mixed
realization
of
his
actual
insignificance
yet
of
his
potential
sublimity
could
he
but
identify
himself
with
his
ultimate
self
in
the
region
of
vision
his
soul
was
aware
of
finding
itself
alternately
ruffled
and
exalted
as
he
read
and
pondered
as
he
visualized
to
some
degree
the
giant
splendors
the
wonderful
wheels
the
spirit
wings
and
faces
and
all
the
other
symbols
of
potent
imagery
evoked
by
the
imagination
of
that
old
hebrew
world
so
that
when
an
hour
later
pacified
and
sleepy
he
rose
to
go
to
bed
this
poetry
seems
to
have
left
a
very
marked
effect
upon
his
mind
mingled
naturally
enough
with
the
thought
of
skale
for
on
his
way
across
the
floor
having
adjusted
the
he
distinctly
remembered
thinking
what
a
splendid
study
the
clergyman
would
have
made
for
one
of
blake
representations
of
the
deity
the
flowing
beard
the
great
nose
the
imposing
head
and
shoulders
the
potentialities
of
the
massive
striding
figure
surrounded
by
a
pictorial
suggestion
of
all
the
he
was
forever
talking
about
this
thought
was
his
last
and
it
was
without
fear
of
any
kind
merely
he
insists
that
his
imagination
was
touched
and
in
a
manner
perfectly
accountable
considering
the
ingredients
of
its
contents
at
the
time
and
so
he
hopped
nimbly
into
bed
on
the
little
table
beside
him
stood
the
candle
and
the
copy
of
the
hebrew
text
he
had
been
reading
with
its
parallel
columns
in
the
two
languages
his
jaeger
slippers
were
beneath
the
chair
his
clothes
carefully
folded
on
the
sofa
his
collar
studs
and
necktie
in
a
row
on
the
top
of
the
mahogany
chest
of
drawers
on
the
mantelpiece
stood
the
glass
jar
of
heather
filled
that
very
day
by
miriam
he
saw
it
just
as
he
blew
out
the
candle
and
miriam
accordingly
was
the
last
vision
that
journeyed
with
him
into
the
country
of
dreams
and
sweet
forgetfulness
the
night
was
perfectly
still
winter
black
and
hard
lay
about
the
house
like
an
iron
wall
no
wind
stirred
snow
covered
the
world
of
mountain
and
moor
outside
and
silence
supreme
at
midnight
poured
all
her
softest
forces
upon
the
ancient
building
and
its
occupants
spinrobin
curled
up
in
the
middle
of
the
big
slept
like
a
tired
baby
ii
it
was
a
good
deal
later
when
somewhere
out
of
that
mass
of
silence
rose
the
faint
beginnings
of
a
sound
that
stirred
first
cautiously
about
the
very
foundations
of
the
house
and
then
mounting
inch
by
inch
through
the
hall
up
the
staircase
along
the
corridor
reached
the
floor
where
the
secretary
slept
so
peacefully
and
finally
entered
his
room
its
muffled
tide
poured
most
softly
over
all
at
first
only
this
murmur
was
audible
as
of
footsteps
upon
wool
of
wind
or
drifting
snow
a
mere
ghost
of
sound
but
gradually
it
grew
though
still
gentle
and
subdued
until
it
filled
the
space
from
ceiling
unto
floor
pressing
in
like
water
dripping
into
a
cistern
with
note
as
its
volume
increased
the
trembling
of
air
in
a
big
belfry
where
bells
have
been
represents
best
the
effect
only
it
was
a
trifle
sharper
in
quality
keener
more
alive
but
also
there
was
something
more
in
it
something
and
metallic
yet
at
the
same
time
oddly
and
suspiciously
human
it
held
a
temper
too
that
somehow
woke
the
panic
sense
as
does
the
hurried
note
of
a
drum
some
quick
emotional
timbre
that
stirs
the
sleeping
outposts
of
apprehension
and
alarm
on
the
other
hand
it
was
constant
neither
rising
nor
falling
and
thus
ordinarily
it
need
not
have
stirred
any
emotion
at
all
least
of
all
the
emotion
of
consternation
yet
there
was
that
in
it
which
struck
at
the
root
of
security
and
life
it
was
a
revolutionary
sound
and
as
it
took
possession
of
the
room
covering
everything
with
its
garment
of
vibration
it
slipped
in
also
so
to
speak
between
the
crevices
of
the
sleeping
unprotected
spinrobin
coloring
his
dreams
his
innocent
dreams
with
the
suggestion
of
nightmare
dread
of
course
he
was
too
deeply
wrapped
in
slumber
to
receive
the
faintest
intimation
of
this
waking
analysis
otherwise
he
might
perhaps
have
recognized
the
kind
of
primitive
ancestral
dread
his
remote
forefathers
knew
when
the
inexplicable
horror
of
a
tidal
wave
or
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
overwhelmed
them
with
the
threatened
alteration
of
their
entire
known
universe
the
sleeping
figure
in
that
big
moved
a
little
as
the
tide
of
sound
played
upon
it
fidgeting
this
way
and
that
the
human
ball
uncoiled
lengthened
straightened
out
the
head
half
hidden
by
folds
of
sheet
and
pillowcase
emerged
spinrobin
unfolded
then
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
about
him
bewildered
in
the
darkness
who
there
is
that
you
anybody
he
asked
in
a
whisper
the
confusion
of
sleep
still
about
him
his
voice
seemed
dead
and
smothered
as
though
the
other
sound
overwhelmed
it
the
same
instant
more
widely
awake
he
realized
that
his
bedroom
was
what
that
what
the
matter
he
whispered
again
wondering
uneasily
at
the
noise
there
was
no
answer
the
vague
dread
transferred
itself
adroitly
from
his
to
his
now
thoroughly
awakened
mind
it
began
to
dawn
upon
him
that
something
was
wrong
he
noticed
that
the
fire
was
out
and
the
room
dark
and
heavy
he
realized
dimly
the
passage
of
time
a
considerable
interval
of
time
and
that
he
must
have
been
asleep
several
hours
where
was
he
was
he
what
in
the
name
of
mystery
and
night
had
been
going
on
during
the
interval
he
began
to
shake
all
over
feverishly
whence
came
this
noise
that
made
everything
in
the
darkness
tremble
as
he
fumbled
hurriedly
for
the
matchbox
his
fingers
caught
in
the
folds
of
pillowcase
and
sheet
and
he
struggled
violently
to
get
them
clear
again
it
was
while
doing
this
that
the
impression
first
reached
him
that
the
room
was
no
longer
quite
the
same
it
had
changed
while
he
slept
even
in
the
darkness
he
felt
this
and
shuddering
pulled
the
blankets
over
his
head
and
shoulders
for
this
idea
of
the
changed
room
plucked
at
the
center
of
his
heart
where
terror
lay
waiting
to
leap
out
upon
him
after
what
seemed
five
minutes
he
found
the
matchbox
and
struck
a
light
and
all
the
time
the
torrent
of
sound
poured
about
his
ears
with
such
an
effect
of
bewilderment
that
he
hardly
realized
what
he
was
doing
a
strange
terror
poured
into
him
that
would
change
with
the
room
at
length
the
match
flared
and
while
he
lit
the
candle
with
shaking
fingers
he
looked
wildly
quickly
about
him
at
once
the
sounds
rushed
upon
him
from
all
directions
burying
him
so
to
speak
beneath
vehement
vibrations
of
the
air
that
rained
in
upon
him
yes
the
room
had
indeed
changed
actually
changed
but
before
he
could
decide
where
the
difference
lay
the
candle
died
down
to
a
mere
spark
waiting
for
the
wick
to
absorb
the
grease
it
seemed
like
half
an
hour
before
the
yellow
tongue
grew
again
so
that
he
finally
saw
clearly
but
saw
what
saw
that
the
room
had
horribly
altered
while
he
slept
yes
but
how
altered
what
in
the
name
of
all
the
world
deities
was
the
matter
with
it
the
torrent
of
sound
now
growing
louder
and
louder
so
confused
him
at
first
and
the
dancing
patchwork
of
light
and
shadow
the
candle
threw
so
increased
his
bewilderment
that
for
some
minutes
he
sought
in
vain
to
steady
his
mind
to
the
point
of
accurate
observation
god
of
my
fathers
cried
spinrobin
at
last
under
his
breath
and
hardly
knowing
what
he
said
if
it
not
moving
for
this
indeed
was
what
he
saw
while
the
candle
flame
burned
steadily
upon
a
room
that
was
no
longer
quite
recognizable
at
first
with
the
natural
exaggeration
due
to
shock
he
thought
the
whole
room
moved
but
as
his
powers
of
sight
came
with
time
to
report
more
truly
he
perceived
that
this
was
only
true
of
certain
things
in
it
it
was
not
the
ceiling
that
poured
down
in
fluid
form
to
meet
a
floor
ever
gliding
and
shifting
forward
into
outlandish
proportions
but
it
was
certain
objects
one
here
another
there
midway
between
the
two
that
having
assumed
new
and
unaccustomed
outlines
lent
to
the
rest
of
the
chamber
a
general
appearance
of
movement
and
an
entirely
altered
expression
and
these
objects
he
perceived
holding
tightly
to
the
bedclothes
with
both
hands
as
he
stared
were
two
the
dark
cupboard
on
his
left
and
the
plush
curtains
that
draped
the
window
on
his
right
he
himself
and
the
bed
and
the
rest
of
the
furniture
were
stationary
the
room
as
a
whole
stood
still
while
these
two
common
and
familiar
articles
of
household
furnishing
took
on
a
form
and
an
expression
utterly
foreign
to
what
he
had
always
known
as
a
cupboard
and
a
curtain
this
outline
this
expression
moreover
if
not
actually
sinister
was
grotesque
to
the
verge
of
the
sinister
monstrous
the
difficulty
of
making
any
accurate
observation
at
all
was
further
increased
by
the
perplexity
of
having
to
observe
two
objects
not
even
on
the
same
side
of
the
room
their
outlines
however
spinrobin
claims
altered
very
slowly
wavering
like
the
distorted
reflections
seen
in
moving
water
and
unquestionably
obeying
in
some
way
the
pitch
and
volume
of
the
sound
that
continued
to
pour
its
resonant
tide
about
the
room
the
sound
manipulated
the
shape
the
connection
between
the
two
was
evident
that
at
least
he
grasped
somebody
hidden
elsewhere
in
the
house
skale
probably
of
course
in
one
of
his
secret
chambers
was
experimenting
with
the
true
names
of
these
two
common
objects
altering
their
normal
forms
by
inserting
the
vibrations
of
sound
between
their
ultimate
molecules
only
this
simple
statement
that
his
clearing
mind
made
to
itself
in
no
way
accounted
for
the
fascination
of
horror
that
accompanied
the
manifestation
for
he
recognized
it
as
the
joy
of
horror
and
not
alone
the
torment
his
blood
ran
swiftly
to
the
rhythm
of
these
humming
vibrations
that
filled
the
space
about
him
and
his
terror
his
bewilderment
his
curious
sense
of
elation
seemed
to
him
as
messengers
of
far
more
terrific
sensations
that
communicated
to
him
dimly
the
rushing
wonder
of
some
aspect
of
the
unknown
in
its
ultimate
nature
essentially
beautiful
this
however
only
dawned
upon
him
later
when
the
experiment
was
complete
and
he
had
time
to
reflect
upon
it
all
next
day
for
meanwhile
to
see
the
proportions
he
had
known
since
childhood
alter
thus
before
his
eyes
was
unbelievably
dreadful
to
see
your
friend
sufficiently
himself
still
to
be
recognizable
yet
in
essentials
at
the
same
time
grotesquely
altered
would
doubtless
touch
a
climax
of
distress
and
horror
for
you
the
changing
of
these
two
things
so
homely
and
in
themselves
into
something
that
was
not
themselves
involved
an
idea
of
destruction
that
was
worse
than
even
death
for
it
meant
that
the
idea
in
the
mind
no
longer
corresponded
to
the
visible
object
there
before
the
eyes
the
correspondence
was
no
longer
a
true
one
the
result
was
a
lie
to
describe
the
actual
forms
assumed
by
these
shifting
and
wavering
bodies
is
not
possible
for
when
spinrobin
gives
the
details
one
simply
fails
to
recognize
either
cupboard
or
curtain
to
say
that
the
dark
lumbering
cupboard
standing
normally
against
the
wall
down
there
in
the
shadows
loomed
suddenly
forward
and
upward
bent
twisted
and
stretched
out
the
whole
of
one
side
towards
him
like
a
misshapen
arm
can
convey
nothing
of
the
world
of
new
sensations
that
the
little
secretary
felt
while
actually
watching
it
in
progress
in
that
haunted
chamber
of
mansion
among
the
hills
nor
can
one
be
thrilled
with
the
extraordinary
sense
of
wonder
that
thrilled
spinrobin
when
he
saw
the
faded
plush
curtain
hang
across
the
window
in
such
a
way
that
it
might
well
have
wrapped
the
whole
of
wales
into
a
single
fold
yet
without
extending
its
skirts
beyond
the
actual
walls
of
the
room
for
what
he
saw
apparently
involved
contradictions
in
words
and
the
fact
is
that
no
description
of
what
he
saw
is
really
possible
at
all
hark
by
thunder
he
exclaimed
creeping
out
of
bed
with
sheer
stress
of
excitement
while
the
sounds
poured
up
through
the
floor
as
though
from
cellars
and
tunnels
where
they
lay
stored
beneath
the
house
they
sang
and
trembled
about
him
with
the
menaces
of
a
really
exquisite
alarm
he
moved
cautiously
out
into
the
center
of
the
room
not
daring
to
approach
too
close
to
the
affected
objects
yet
furiously
anxious
to
discover
how
it
was
all
done
for
he
was
uncommonly
game
through
it
all
and
had
himself
well
in
hand
from
beginning
to
end
he
was
really
too
excited
probably
to
feel
ordinary
fear
it
all
swept
him
away
too
mightily
for
that
he
did
not
even
notice
the
sting
of
the
hot
as
it
fell
upon
his
bare
feet
there
he
stood
plucky
little
spinny
steady
amid
this
shifting
world
master
of
his
soul
amid
dissolution
his
hair
pointing
out
like
ruffled
feathers
his
blue
eyes
wide
open
and
charged
with
a
speechless
wonder
his
face
pale
as
chalk
lips
apart
jaw
a
trifle
dropped
one
hand
in
the
pocket
of
his
and
the
other
holding
the
candle
at
an
angle
that
showered
grease
upon
the
carpet
of
the
rev
philip
skale
as
well
as
upon
his
own
ankles
there
he
stood
face
to
face
with
the
grotesque
horror
of
familiar
outlines
gone
wrong
the
altered
panorama
of
his
known
world
moving
about
him
in
a
strange
riot
of
sound
and
form
it
was
he
understood
an
amazing
exhibition
of
the
transforming
power
of
sound
of
sound
playing
tricks
with
the
impermanence
and
the
illusion
of
form
skale
was
making
his
words
good
and
behind
the
scenes
he
divined
with
a
shudder
of
genuine
admiration
the
figure
of
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
somehow
or
other
grown
colossal
as
he
had
thought
of
him
just
before
going
to
sleep
philip
skale
hidden
in
the
secret
places
of
the
building
directing
the
operations
of
this
dreadful
aspect
of
his
revolutionary
discovery
and
yet
the
thought
brought
a
measure
of
comfort
in
its
train
for
was
he
not
also
himself
now
included
in
the
mighty
scheme
in
his
mind
he
saw
this
giant
skale
with
his
great
limbs
and
shoulders
his
flowing
shaggy
beard
his
voice
of
thunder
and
his
portentous
speculations
and
so
doing
felt
himself
merged
in
a
larger
world
that
made
his
own
little
terrors
and
anxieties
of
but
small
account
once
again
the
sense
of
his
own
insignificance
disappeared
as
he
realized
that
at
last
he
was
in
the
full
flood
of
an
adventure
that
was
providing
the
kind
of
escape
he
had
always
longed
for
inevitably
then
his
thought
flew
to
miriam
and
as
he
remembered
her
final
word
to
him
a
few
short
hours
ago
in
the
hall
below
he
already
felt
ashamed
of
the
fear
with
which
he
had
met
the
beginning
of
the
test
he
instantly
felt
steeped
instead
in
the
wonder
and
power
of
the
whole
thing
his
mind
though
still
trembling
and
shaken
came
to
rest
he
drew
that
is
upon
the
larger
powers
of
the
chord
and
the
interesting
thing
was
that
the
moment
this
happened
he
noticed
a
change
begin
to
come
over
the
room
with
extraordinary
swiftness
the
tide
of
vibration
lessened
and
the
sound
withdrew
the
humming
seemed
to
sink
back
into
the
depths
of
the
house
the
thrill
and
delight
of
his
recent
terrors
fled
with
it
the
air
gradually
ceased
to
shake
and
tremble
the
furniture
with
a
curious
final
shiver
as
of
spinning
coins
about
to
settle
resumed
its
normal
shape
once
more
the
room
and
with
it
the
world
became
commonplace
and
dull
the
test
apparently
was
over
he
had
met
it
with
success
spinrobin
holding
the
candle
straight
for
the
first
time
turned
back
towards
the
bed
he
caught
a
passing
glimpse
of
himself
in
the
mirror
as
he
went
white
and
scattered
he
describes
his
appearance
he
climbed
again
into
bed
blew
the
candle
out
put
the
matchbox
under
his
pillow
within
easy
reach
and
so
once
more
curled
himself
up
into
a
ball
and
composed
himself
to
sleep
chapter
ix
i
but
he
was
hardly
settled
there
had
not
even
been
time
to
warm
the
sheets
again
when
he
was
aware
that
the
test
instead
of
being
over
was
indeed
but
just
beginning
and
the
detail
that
conveyed
this
unwelcome
knowledge
to
him
though
small
enough
in
itself
was
yet
fraught
with
a
crowded
cargo
of
new
alarms
it
was
a
step
upon
the
staircase
approaching
his
room
he
heard
it
the
instant
he
lay
still
in
bed
after
the
shuffling
process
known
generally
as
cuddling
down
and
he
knew
that
it
was
approaching
because
of
the
assistance
the
hall
clock
brought
to
his
bewildered
ears
for
the
hall
clock
a
big
dignified
piece
of
furniture
with
a
deep
note
happened
just
then
to
strike
the
hour
of
two
in
the
morning
and
there
was
a
considerable
interval
between
the
two
notes
he
first
heard
the
step
far
below
in
the
act
of
leaving
the
flagged
hall
for
the
staircase
then
the
clock
drowned
it
with
its
first
stroke
and
perhaps
a
dozen
seconds
later
when
the
second
stroke
had
died
away
he
heard
the
step
again
as
it
passed
from
the
top
of
the
staircase
on
to
the
polished
boards
of
the
landing
the
owner
of
the
step
meanwhile
had
passed
up
the
whole
length
of
the
staircase
in
the
interval
and
was
now
coming
across
the
landing
in
a
direct
line
towards
his
bedroom
door
it
a
step
i
suppose
it
seems
he
muttered
to
himself
as
with
head
partially
raised
above
the
blankets
he
listened
intently
it
a
i
mean
for
the
sound
was
more
like
a
light
tapping
of
a
little
hammer
than
an
actual
step
some
hard
substance
drumming
automatically
upon
the
floor
while
yet
moving
in
advance
he
recognized
however
that
there
was
intelligence
behind
its
movements
because
of
the
sense
of
direction
it
displayed
and
by
the
fact
that
it
had
turned
the
sharp
corner
of
the
stairs
but
the
idea
presented
itself
in
fugitive
fashion
to
his
mind
heaven
alone
knows
why
that
it
might
be
some
mechanical
contrivance
that
was
worked
from
the
hall
by
a
hand
for
the
sound
was
too
light
to
be
the
tread
of
a
person
yet
too
conscious
to
be
merely
a
sound
of
the
night
operating
mechanically
and
it
was
unlike
the
noise
that
the
feet
of
any
animal
would
make
any
animal
that
he
could
think
of
that
is
a
creature
suggested
itself
to
his
mind
but
without
approval
the
puzzling
characteristics
of
the
sound
therefore
contradictory
as
they
were
left
him
utterly
perplexed
so
that
for
some
little
time
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
whether
to
be
frightened
interested
or
merely
curious
this
uncertainty
however
lasted
but
a
moment
or
two
at
the
most
for
an
appreciable
pause
outside
his
door
was
next
followed
by
a
noise
of
scratching
upon
the
panels
as
of
hands
or
paws
and
then
by
the
shuffling
of
some
living
body
that
was
flattening
itself
in
an
attempt
to
squeeze
through
the
considerable
crack
between
door
and
flooring
and
so
to
enter
the
room
and
hearing
it
spinrobin
this
time
was
so
petrified
with
an
instantaneous
rush
of
terror
that
at
first
he
dared
not
even
move
to
find
the
matches
again
under
his
pillow
the
pause
was
dreadful
he
longed
for
brilliant
light
that
should
reveal
all
parts
of
the
room
equally
or
else
for
a
thick
darkness
that
should
conceal
him
from
everything
in
the
world
the
uncertain
flicker
of
a
single
candle
playing
miserably
between
the
two
was
the
last
thing
in
the
world
to
appeal
to
him
and
then
events
crowded
too
thick
and
fast
for
him
to
recognize
any
one
emotion
in
particular
from
all
the
fire
of
them
passing
so
swiftly
in
and
out
among
his
hopelessly
disorganized
thoughts
terror
flashed
but
with
it
flashed
also
wonder
and
delight
the
audacity
of
unreflecting
courage
and
more
even
a
breathless
worship
of
the
powers
knowledge
and
forces
that
lifted
for
him
in
that
little
bedroom
the
vast
transparency
that
hides
from
men
the
unknown
it
is
soon
told
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
and
then
he
knew
that
the
invader
had
effected
an
entrance
there
was
barely
time
to
marvel
at
the
thinness
of
the
living
creature
that
could
avail
itself
of
so
narrow
a
space
when
to
his
amazement
he
heard
the
quick
patter
of
feet
across
the
space
of
boarded
flooring
next
the
wall
and
then
the
silence
that
muffled
them
as
they
reached
the
carpet
proper
almost
at
the
same
second
something
leaped
upon
his
bed
and
there
shot
swiftly
across
him
a
living
thing
with
light
firm
tread
a
creature
so
far
as
he
could
form
any
judgment
at
all
about
the
size
of
a
rabbit
or
a
cat
he
felt
the
feet
pushing
through
sheets
and
blankets
upon
his
body
they
were
little
feet
how
many
at
that
stage
he
could
not
guess
then
he
heard
the
thud
as
it
dropped
to
the
floor
upon
the
other
side
the
panic
terror
that
in
the
dark
it
would
run
upon
his
bare
exposed
face
thus
passed
and
in
that
moment
of
intense
relief
spinrobin
gripped
his
soul
so
to
speak
with
both
hands
and
made
the
effort
of
his
life
whatever
happened
now
he
must
have
a
light
be
it
only
the
light
of
a
single
miserable
candle
in
that
moment
he
felt
that
he
would
have
sacrificed
all
his
hopes
of
the
hereafter
to
have
turned
on
a
flood
of
searching
and
brilliant
sunshine
into
every
corner
of
the
room
instantaneously
the
thought
that
the
creature
might
jump
again
upon
the
bed
and
touch
him
before
he
could
see
gave
him
energy
to
act
with
dashes
of
terror
shooting
through
him
like
spears
of
ice
he
grabbed
the
matchbox
and
after
a
frenzied
entanglement
again
with
sheets
and
succeeded
in
breaking
four
matches
in
quick
succession
they
cracked
it
seemed
to
him
like
pistol
shots
till
he
half
expected
that
this
creature
waiting
there
in
the
darkness
must
leap
out
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
to
attack
him
the
fifth
lit
and
a
moment
later
the
candle
was
burning
dimly
but
with
its
usual
exasperating
leisure
and
delay
as
the
flare
died
down
then
gradually
rose
again
he
fairly
swallowed
the
room
with
a
single
look
wishing
there
were
eyes
all
over
his
body
it
was
a
very
faint
light
at
first
he
saw
nothing
heard
nothing
nothing
alive
that
is
i
must
act
i
must
do
something
at
once
he
remembered
thinking
for
to
wait
meant
to
leave
the
choice
and
moment
of
attack
to
this
other
cautiously
and
very
slowly
therefore
he
wriggled
to
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
slid
over
searching
with
his
feet
for
slippers
but
finding
none
yet
not
daring
to
lower
his
eyes
to
look
then
stood
upright
with
a
sudden
rush
shading
the
candle
from
his
eyes
with
one
hand
and
peering
over
it
as
a
rule
in
moments
of
overwhelming
emotion
the
eyes
search
too
eagerly
too
furiously
to
see
properly
at
all
but
this
does
not
seem
to
have
been
the
case
with
spinrobin
the
shadows
ran
about
like
water
and
the
flickering
of
the
dazzled
but
there
opposite
to
him
over
by
the
darkness
of
the
dead
fireplace
he
saw
instantly
the
small
black
object
that
was
the
immediate
cause
of
his
terror
its
actual
shape
was
merged
too
much
in
the
dark
background
to
be
clearly
ascertainable
but
near
the
top
of
it
where
presumably
the
head
was
the
shone
reflected
in
two
brilliant
points
of
light
that
were
directed
straight
upon
his
face
and
he
knew
that
he
was
looking
into
the
eyes
of
a
living
creature
that
was
not
the
very
least
on
the
defensive
it
was
a
living
creature
aggressive
and
unafraid
for
perhaps
a
couple
of
minutes
or
was
it
seconds
only
these
two
beings
with
the
breath
of
life
in
them
faced
one
another
then
spinrobin
made
a
step
cautiously
in
advance
lowering
his
candle
he
moved
towards
it
this
he
did
partly
to
see
better
partly
to
protect
his
bare
legs
the
idea
of
protection
however
seems
to
have
been
merely
instinct
for
at
once
this
notion
that
it
might
dash
forward
to
attack
him
was
merged
in
the
unaccountable
realization
of
a
far
grander
emotion
as
he
perceived
that
this
living
creature
facing
him
was
for
all
its
diminutive
size
both
dignified
and
imposing
something
in
its
atmosphere
something
about
its
mysterious
presentment
there
upon
the
floor
in
its
dark
corner
something
perhaps
that
flashed
from
its
brilliant
and
almost
terrible
eyes
managed
to
convey
to
him
that
it
was
clothed
with
an
importance
and
a
significance
not
attached
normally
to
the
animal
world
it
had
an
air
it
bore
itself
with
power
with
value
almost
with
pride
this
incongruous
impression
bereft
him
of
the
sensations
of
ordinary
fear
while
it
increased
the
sources
of
his
confusion
yet
it
convinced
he
knew
himself
face
to
face
with
some
form
of
life
that
was
considerable
in
the
true
sense
spiritually
it
exercised
a
fascination
over
him
that
was
at
the
moment
beyond
either
explanation
or
belief
as
he
moved
moreover
the
little
dark
object
also
moved
away
from
him
as
though
resenting
closer
inspection
with
action
again
unlike
the
action
of
any
animal
he
could
think
of
and
essentially
dignified
both
rapid
and
nicely
calculated
it
ran
towards
the
curtains
behind
this
appearance
of
something
stately
that
went
with
it
was
indefinable
and
beyond
everything
impressive
for
how
in
the
world
could
such
small
proportions
and
diminutive
movements
convey
grandeur
and
again
spinrobin
found
it
impossible
to
decide
precisely
how
it
moved
whether
on
four
legs
or
on
two
keeping
the
two
points
of
light
always
turned
upon
him
it
shot
across
the
floor
leaped
easily
upon
a
chair
passed
with
a
nimble
spring
from
this
to
a
table
by
the
wall
still
too
much
in
obscurity
to
permit
a
proper
view
and
then
while
the
amazed
secretary
approached
cautiously
to
follow
its
movements
better
it
crawled
to
the
edge
of
the
table
and
in
so
doing
passed
for
the
first
time
full
across
the
pale
zone
of
flickering
candlelight
spinrobin
in
that
quick
second
caught
a
glimpse
of
flying
hair
and
saw
that
it
moved
either
as
a
human
being
or
as
a
bird
on
two
legs
the
same
moment
it
sprang
deftly
from
the
high
table
to
the
mantelpiece
turned
stood
erect
and
looked
at
him
with
the
whole
glare
of
the
light
upon
its
face
and
spinrobin
bereft
of
all
power
of
intelligible
sensation
whatever
saw
to
his
unutterable
distress
that
it
was
a
man
the
dignity
of
its
movements
had
already
stirred
vaguely
his
sense
of
awe
but
now
the
realization
beyond
doubt
of
its
diminutive
shape
added
a
singularly
acute
touch
of
horror
and
it
was
the
combination
of
the
two
emotions
possibly
that
were
responsible
also
for
the
two
remarkable
impulses
of
which
he
was
first
conscious
first
a
mad
desire
to
strike
and
kill
secondly
an
imperious
feeling
that
he
must
hide
his
eyes
in
some
act
or
other
of
worship
and
it
was
then
he
realized
that
the
man
was
philip
skale
skale
scarcely
a
foot
high
dressed
as
usual
in
black
flowing
beard
hooked
nose
lambent
flashing
eyes
and
all
stood
there
upon
the
mantelpiece
level
with
his
secretary
face
not
three
feet
separating
them
and
smiled
at
him
he
was
small
as
a
tanagra
figure
and
in
perfect
proportion
it
was
unspeakably
terrible
ii
of
course
i
dreaming
cried
spinrobin
half
aloud
half
to
the
figure
before
him
he
searched
behind
him
with
one
hand
for
solid
support
you
a
dream
thing
it
some
awful
trick
god
will
protect
me
skale
tiny
lips
moved
no
no
his
voice
said
and
it
sounded
as
from
a
great
distance
i
no
dream
thing
at
all
and
you
are
wide
awake
look
at
me
well
i
am
the
man
you
know
philip
skale
look
straight
into
my
eyes
and
be
convinced
again
he
smiled
his
kindly
winning
smile
what
you
now
see
is
nothing
but
a
result
of
sounding
my
true
name
in
a
certain
way
very
softly
to
increase
the
cohesion
of
my
physical
molecules
and
reduce
my
visible
expression
listen
and
watch
and
spinrobin
half
stupefied
obeyed
feeling
that
his
weakening
knees
must
in
another
moment
give
way
and
precipitate
him
to
the
floor
he
was
utterly
unnerved
the
onslaught
of
terror
and
amazement
was
overwhelming
for
something
dreadful
beyond
all
words
lay
in
the
sight
of
this
man
whom
he
was
accustomed
to
reverence
in
his
gigantic
everyday
shape
here
reduced
to
the
stature
of
a
pygmy
yet
compelling
as
ever
terrific
even
when
thus
dwarfed
and
to
hear
the
voice
of
thunder
that
he
knew
so
well
come
to
him
disguised
within
this
thin
and
almost
wailing
tone
passed
equally
beyond
the
limits
of
what
he
could
feel
as
emotion
or
translate
into
any
intelligible
words
or
gesture
while
therefore
the
secretary
stood
in
awful
wonder
doing
as
he
was
told
simply
because
he
could
do
nothing
else
the
figure
of
the
clergyman
moved
with
tiny
steps
to
the
edge
of
the
mantelpiece
until
it
seemed
as
though
he
meant
in
another
moment
to
leap
on
to
his
companion
shoulder
or
into
his
arms
at
the
edge
however
he
stopped
the
brink
of
a
precipice
to
him
and
spinrobin
then
became
aware
that
from
his
moving
lips
though
bearded
his
voice
was
issuing
with
an
volume
of
sound
and
power
vibrations
of
depth
and
were
spreading
through
the
air
about
him
filling
the
room
from
floor
to
ceiling
what
the
syllables
actually
uttered
may
have
been
he
was
too
dazed
to
realize
for
no
degree
of
concentration
was
possible
to
his
mind
at
all
he
only
knew
that
before
his
smarting
eyes
with
this
rising
of
the
voice
to
its
old
dominant
inflexion
the
figure
of
philip
skale
grew
likewise
indescribably
swelled
rose
spread
upwards
and
outwards
but
with
the
parts
ever
passing
slowly
in
consistent
from
minute
to
minute
he
became
always
in
perfect
proportion
magnified
and
extended
the
growing
form
moreover
kept
pace
exactly
and
most
beautifully
with
the
increasing
tide
of
sonorous
vibration
that
flooded
himself
its
utterer
and
the
whole
room
spinrobin
it
seems
had
just
sufficient
left
to
realize
that
this
sound
was
similar
in
quality
to
that
which
had
first
awakened
him
and
caused
the
outlines
of
the
furniture
to
alter
when
the
sight
of
skale
form
changing
thus
terribly
before
his
eyes
and
within
the
touch
of
his
very
hand
became
too
much
for
him
altogether
what
precisely
happened
he
never
knew
the
sounds
first
enveloped
him
then
drove
him
backwards
with
a
sense
of
immense
applied
resistance
he
collapsed
upon
the
sofa
a
few
feet
behind
him
as
though
irresistibly
pushed
the
power
that
impelled
him
charged
vehemently
through
the
little
room
till
it
seemed
the
walls
must
burst
asunder
to
give
it
scope
while
the
sounds
rose
to
such
a
volume
that
he
figured
himself
drowned
and
overpowered
by
their
mighty
vibrations
as
by
the
storm
swells
of
the
atlantic
before
he
lost
them
as
sound
he
seems
thus
to
have
been
aware
of
them
as
moving
waves
of
air
the
next
thing
he
took
in
was
that
amid
the
waste
of
silence
that
now
followed
his
inability
to
hear
the
figure
of
philip
skale
towered
aloft
towards
the
ceiling
till
it
seemed
positively
to
occupy
all
the
available
space
in
the
room
about
him
had
he
dropped
upon
the
floor
instead
of
upon
the
sofa
it
is
probable
that
at
this
point
spinrobin
would
have
lost
consciousness
at
any
rate
for
a
period
but
that
sofa
which
luckily
for
his
bones
was
so
close
behind
galvanized
him
sharply
back
into
some
measure
of
again
being
provided
with
powerful
springs
it
shot
him
up
into
the
air
whence
he
relapsed
with
a
series
of
smaller
bounds
into
a
normal
sitting
posture
still
holding
the
lighted
candle
as
best
he
could
the
little
secretary
bounced
upon
that
sofa
like
a
tennis
ball
and
the
violent
motion
shook
him
into
himself
as
it
were
his
tottering
universe
struggled
back
into
shape
once
more
he
remembered
vaguely
that
all
this
was
somehow
a
test
of
his
courage
and
fitness
and
this
thought
strengthened
by
a
law
of
his
temperament
which
forced
him
to
welcome
the
sweet
mad
terror
of
the
whole
adventure
helped
to
call
out
the
reserves
of
his
failing
courage
he
bounced
upon
his
feet
again
those
bare
feet
plastered
with
candle
grease
and
turning
his
head
saw
the
clergyman
of
incredible
stature
yet
still
apparently
increasing
already
over
by
the
door
he
was
turning
the
key
with
a
hand
the
size
o
horror
of
spinrobin
breast
the
next
moment
his
vast
stooping
body
filled
the
entire
entrance
blotting
out
whole
portions
of
the
walls
on
either
side
then
was
gone
from
the
room
leaving
the
candlestick
on
the
sofa
his
heart
aflame
with
a
fearful
ecstasy
of
curiosity
he
dashed
across
the
floor
in
pursuit
but
skale
silently
and
with
the
swiftness
of
a
river
was
already
down
the
stairs
before
he
had
covered
half
the
distance
through
the
framework
of
the
door
spinrobin
saw
this
picture
skale
like
some
awful
cyclops
stood
upon
the
floor
of
the
hall
some
twenty
feet
below
yet
rearing
terrifically
up
through
the
well
of
the
building
till
his
head
and
shoulders
alone
seemed
to
fill
the
entire
space
beneath
the
skylight
though
his
feet
rested
unquestionably
upon
the
ground
his
face
huge
as
a
planet
in
the
sky
rose
looming
and
half
lighted
above
the
banisters
of
this
second
storey
his
tangled
locks
sweeping
the
ceiling
and
his
beard
like
some
dark
river
of
hair
flowing
downwards
through
the
night
and
this
spreading
countenance
of
cloud
it
was
hanging
in
the
that
spinrobin
saw
turn
slowly
towards
him
across
the
faint
flicker
of
the
candlelight
look
straight
down
into
his
face
and
smile
the
great
mouth
and
eyes
unquestionably
smiled
and
that
smile
for
all
its
vast
terror
was
beyond
words
enchanting
like
the
spread
laughter
of
a
summer
landscape
among
the
spaces
of
the
immense
visage
reminding
him
curiously
of
his
boyhood
conception
of
the
creator
spinrobin
lost
himself
and
grew
dizzy
with
a
deadly
yet
delicious
faintness
the
mighty
tenderness
the
compassion
the
splendor
of
that
giant
smile
overpowered
him
and
swallowed
him
up
for
one
second
in
dreadful
silence
he
gazed
then
rising
to
meet
the
test
with
a
courage
that
he
felt
might
somehow
involve
the
alteration
if
not
the
actual
destruction
of
his
own
little
personality
but
that
also
proved
his
supreme
gameness
at
the
same
time
he
tried
to
smile
in
return
the
strange
and
pitiful
attempt
upon
his
own
face
perhaps
in
the
was
not
seen
he
only
remembers
that
he
somehow
found
strength
to
crawl
forward
and
close
the
door
with
a
bang
though
not
the
strength
to
turn
the
key
and
lock
it
and
that
two
seconds
later
having
kicked
the
candle
over
and
out
in
his
flying
leap
he
was
in
the
middle
of
the
bed
under
a
confused
pile
of
sheets
and
blankets
weeping
with
muffled
sobs
in
the
darkness
as
though
his
heart
must
burst
with
the
wonder
and
terror
of
all
he
had
witnessed
for
to
the
simple
in
heart
at
the
end
of
all
possible
stress
and
strain
of
emotion
comes
mercifully
the
blinding
relief
of
tears
and
then
although
too
overcome
to
be
able
to
prove
it
even
to
himself
it
was
significant
that
lying
there
smothered
among
the
bedclothes
he
became
aware
of
the
presence
of
something
astonishingly
sweet
and
comforting
in
his
consciousness
it
came
quite
suddenly
upon
him
the
reaction
he
experienced
he
says
was
very
wonderful
for
with
it
the
sense
of
absolute
safety
and
security
returned
to
him
like
a
terrified
child
in
the
darkness
who
suddenly
knows
that
its
mother
stands
by
the
bed
to
soothe
he
felt
certain
that
some
one
had
moved
into
the
room
was
close
beside
him
and
was
even
trying
to
smooth
his
pillow
and
arrange
the
twisted
bedclothes
he
did
not
dare
uncover
his
face
to
see
for
he
was
still
dominated
by
the
memory
of
skale
portentous
visage
but
his
ears
were
not
so
easily
denied
and
he
was
positive
that
he
heard
a
voice
that
called
his
name
as
though
it
were
the
opening
phrase
of
some
sweet
childhood
lullaby
there
was
a
touch
about
him
somewhere
it
seemed
of
delicate
cool
hands
that
brought
with
them
the
fragrance
as
of
a
scented
summer
wind
and
the
last
thing
he
remembered
before
he
sank
away
into
welcome
unconsciousness
was
an
impression
fugitive
and
dreamlike
of
a
gentle
face
unstained
and
pale
as
marble
that
bent
above
his
pillow
and
singing
called
him
away
to
forgetfulness
and
peace
iii
and
several
hours
later
when
he
woke
after
a
refreshing
sleep
to
find
mawle
smiling
down
upon
him
over
a
tray
of
steaming
coffee
he
recalled
the
events
of
the
night
with
a
sense
of
vivid
reality
that
if
possible
increased
his
conviction
of
their
truth
but
without
the
smallest
symptom
of
terror
or
dismay
for
the
blessing
of
the
presence
that
had
soothed
him
into
sleep
lay
still
upon
him
like
a
garment
to
protect
the
test
had
come
and
he
had
not
wholly
failed
with
something
approaching
amusement
he
watched
the
housekeeper
pick
up
a
candlestick
from
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
put
his
jaeger
slippers
beneath
the
chair
having
found
one
by
the
cupboard
and
the
other
over
by
the
fireplace
skale
compliments
and
spinrobin
is
not
to
hurry
himself
he
heard
her
saying
as
she
put
the
tray
beside
the
bed
and
went
out
of
the
room
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
saw
that
it
was
after
ten
half
an
hour
later
he
was
dressed
and
on
his
way
downstairs
conscious
only
of
an
overwhelming
desire
to
see
skale
but
to
see
him
in
his
normal
and
fatherly
aspect
again
for
a
strain
of
worship
mingled
oddly
with
his
devouring
curiosity
and
he
was
thirsty
now
for
the
rest
of
the
adventure
for
the
complete
revelation
of
the
discovery
in
all
its
bearings
and
the
moment
he
saw
the
clergyman
in
the
hall
he
ran
towards
him
scarcely
realizing
what
it
was
he
meant
to
say
or
do
skale
stretched
out
both
hands
to
meet
him
his
face
was
alight
with
pleasure
but
before
they
could
meet
and
touch
a
door
opened
and
in
slipped
miriam
between
them
she
too
was
radiant
and
her
hands
outstretched
me
first
please
me
first
she
cried
with
happy
laughter
and
before
spinrobin
realized
what
was
happening
she
had
flung
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
kissed
him
you
were
splendid
she
whispered
in
his
ear
and
i
proud
of
you
ever
so
proud
the
next
minute
skale
had
him
by
the
hands
well
done
well
done
his
voice
boomed
while
he
gazed
down
into
his
face
with
enthusiastic
and
unqualified
approval
it
was
all
magnificent
my
dear
little
fellow
you
got
the
heart
of
a
god
and
by
heavens
you
shall
become
as
a
god
too
for
you
are
worthy
he
shook
him
violently
by
both
hands
while
miriam
looked
eagerly
on
with
admiration
in
her
wide
grey
eyes
i
so
glad
so
awfully
glad
stammered
the
secretary
remembering
with
shame
his
moments
of
vivid
terror
he
hardly
knew
what
he
said
at
the
moment
the
properties
of
things
thundered
the
clergyman
as
you
have
now
learned
are
merely
the
utterances
of
the
sounds
that
made
them
the
thing
itself
is
its
name
he
spoke
rapidly
with
intense
ardor
and
with
reverence
you
have
seen
with
your
own
eyes
a
scientific
proof
of
my
discovery
on
its
humblest
level
how
the
physical
properties
of
objects
can
be
manipulated
by
the
vibratory
utterance
of
their
true
names
can
be
extended
reduced
glorified
next
you
shall
learn
that
spiritual
qualities
the
attributes
of
higher
states
of
being
can
be
similarly
dealt
with
and
harnessed
exalted
intensified
and
that
the
correct
utterance
of
mighty
names
can
seduce
their
specific
qualities
into
your
own
soul
to
make
you
mighty
and
eternal
as
themselves
and
that
to
call
upon
the
great
names
is
no
idle
phrase
when
the
time
comes
spinrobin
you
shall
not
shrink
you
shall
not
shrink
he
flung
his
arms
out
with
a
great
gesture
of
delight
no
repeated
spinrobin
yet
aware
that
he
felt
mentally
battered
at
the
prospect
i
shall
not
shrink
i
think
now
i
can
manage
anything
and
then
watching
miriam
with
lingering
glance
as
she
vanished
laughing
up
the
staircase
he
followed
skale
into
the
library
his
thoughts
tearing
wildly
to
and
fro
swelling
with
delight
and
pride
thrilling
with
the
wonder
of
what
was
yet
to
come
there
with
fewest
possible
sentences
the
clergyman
announced
that
he
now
accepted
him
and
would
therefore
carry
out
the
promise
with
regard
to
the
bequeathal
of
his
property
to
him
in
the
event
of
any
untoward
circumstances
arising
later
he
also
handed
to
him
in
cash
the
salary
for
the
trial
month
together
with
a
check
for
the
first
quarter
in
advance
he
was
beaming
with
the
satisfaction
he
felt
at
having
found
at
last
a
really
qualified
helper
spinrobin
looked
into
his
face
as
they
shook
hands
over
the
bargain
he
was
thinking
of
other
aspects
he
had
seen
of
this
amazing
being
but
a
few
hours
before
the
minute
the
colossal
the
skales
i
game
skale
he
said
simply
forgetting
all
his
recent
doubts
and
terrors
i
know
you
are
the
clergyman
replied
i
knew
it
all
along
chapter
x
i
the
first
thing
spinrobin
knew
when
he
ran
upstairs
to
lock
away
the
money
in
his
desk
was
that
his
whole
being
without
his
directing
it
asked
a
question
of
momentous
import
he
did
not
himself
ask
it
deliberately
he
surprised
his
asking
it
what
is
this
name
that
philip
skale
forever
seeks
it
was
no
longer
mere
curiosity
that
asked
it
but
that
sense
of
responsibility
which
in
all
men
of
principle
and
character
lies
at
the
root
of
action
and
of
life
and
spinrobin
for
all
his
little
weaknesses
was
a
man
of
character
and
principle
there
came
a
point
when
he
could
no
longer
follow
blindly
where
others
led
even
though
the
leader
were
so
grand
an
individual
as
philip
skale
this
point
is
reached
at
varying
degrees
of
the
moral
thermometer
and
but
for
the
love
that
miriam
had
wakened
in
his
heart
it
might
have
taken
much
longer
to
send
the
mercury
of
his
will
so
high
in
so
short
a
time
he
now
felt
responsibility
for
two
and
in
the
depths
of
his
queer
confused
little
mind
stirred
the
thought
that
possibly
after
all
the
great
adventure
he
sought
was
only
the
supreme
adventure
of
a
very
wonderful
love
he
records
these
two
questions
at
this
point
and
it
is
only
just
to
himself
therefore
to
set
them
down
here
to
neither
was
the
answer
yet
forthcoming
for
some
days
the
routine
of
this
singular
household
followed
its
normal
course
the
only
change
being
that
while
the
secretary
practiced
his
hebrew
names
and
studied
the
relations
between
sound
color
form
and
the
rest
he
kept
himself
a
little
better
in
hand
for
love
is
a
mighty
humanizer
and
holds
down
the
nose
upon
the
grindstone
of
the
wholesome
and
practical
values
of
existence
he
turned
so
to
speak
and
tried
to
face
the
matter
squarely
to
see
the
adventure
as
a
whole
to
get
all
round
it
and
judge
it
seems
however
that
he
was
too
much
in
the
thick
of
it
to
get
that
view
which
reduces
details
to
the
right
proportion
skale
personality
was
too
close
and
flooded
him
too
violently
spinrobin
remained
confused
and
bewildered
but
also
unbelievably
happy
coming
out
all
right
he
wrote
shakily
in
that
diary
beginning
to
understand
why
i
in
the
world
am
just
as
important
as
anybody
else
impossible
explain
more
his
entries
were
very
like
telegrams
in
which
a
man
attempts
to
express
in
a
lucid
shorthand
all
manner
of
things
that
the
actual
words
hardly
compass
and
life
itself
is
not
unlike
some
mighty
telegram
that
seeks
vainly
to
express
between
the
extremes
of
silence
and
excess
all
that
the
soul
would
say
skale
is
going
too
far
perhaps
best
expresses
the
daily
burden
of
his
accumulating
apprehension
he
is
leading
up
to
something
that
makes
me
shrink
something
not
quite
legitimate
playing
with
an
olympian
fire
that
may
consume
us
both
and
there
his
telegram
stopped
for
how
in
the
world
could
he
put
into
mere
language
the
pain
and
distress
involved
in
the
thought
that
it
might
at
the
same
time
consume
miriam
it
all
touched
appalling
depths
of
awe
in
his
soul
it
made
his
heart
shake
the
girl
had
become
a
part
of
his
very
self
vivid
reactions
he
suffered
alternating
with
equally
vivid
enthusiasms
he
realized
how
visionary
the
clergyman
poetical
talk
was
but
the
next
minute
the
practical
results
staggered
him
again
as
it
were
back
into
a
state
of
conviction
for
the
poetry
obscured
his
judgment
and
fired
his
imagination
so
that
he
could
not
follow
calmly
the
feeling
that
it
was
not
only
illogical
but
insane
troubled
him
yet
the
physical
effects
stared
him
in
the
face
and
to
argue
with
physical
results
is
waste
of
time
one
must
act
yet
how
act
the
only
way
that
offered
he
accepted
he
fell
back
upon
the
habits
of
his
boyhood
read
his
bible
and
at
night
dropped
humbly
upon
his
knees
and
prayed
keep
me
straight
and
pure
and
simple
and
bless
miriam
grant
that
i
may
love
and
strengthen
her
and
that
my
love
may
bring
her
peace
and
joy
and
guide
me
through
all
this
terror
i
beseech
thee
into
truth
for
in
the
beauty
of
his
selfless
love
he
dared
not
even
admit
that
it
was
love
feeling
only
the
highest
he
could
not
quite
correlate
his
sweet
and
elevated
passion
with
the
common
standards
of
what
the
world
called
love
the
humility
of
a
great
love
is
ever
amazing
and
then
followed
in
his
prayers
the
more
cowardly
cry
for
ordinary
protection
from
the
possible
results
of
skale
audacity
the
love
of
god
he
could
understand
but
the
wrath
of
god
was
a
conception
he
was
still
unemancipated
enough
to
dread
and
a
dark
portentous
terror
that
skale
might
incur
it
and
that
he
might
be
dragged
at
its
heels
into
some
hideous
catastrophe
chased
him
through
the
days
and
nights
it
all
seemed
so
unlawful
impious
blasphemous
and
preserve
us
from
vain
presumptions
of
the
heart
and
brain
i
pray
thee
lest
we
be
consumed
please
o
god
forgive
the
insolence
of
our
wills
and
the
ignorant
daring
of
our
spirit
permit
not
the
innocent
to
suffer
for
the
guilty
and
especially
bless
miriam
yet
through
it
all
ran
that
exquisite
memory
of
the
calling
of
his
true
name
in
the
spaces
of
his
soul
the
beauty
of
unattainable
things
hovered
like
a
star
above
his
head
so
that
he
went
about
the
house
with
an
insatiable
yearning
in
his
heart
a
perpetual
smile
of
wonder
upon
his
face
and
in
his
eyes
a
gleam
that
was
sometimes
terror
sometimes
delight
it
was
almost
as
if
some
great
voice
called
to
him
from
the
mountaintops
and
the
little
chap
was
forever
answering
in
his
heart
i
coming
coming
and
then
losing
his
way
purposely
or
hiding
behind
bushes
on
the
way
for
fear
of
meeting
the
great
invisible
caller
face
to
face
ii
and
meanwhile
the
house
became
for
him
a
kind
of
as
it
were
protected
from
desecration
by
the
hills
and
desolate
spaces
that
surrounded
it
from
dawn
to
darkness
its
halls
and
corridors
echoed
with
the
singing
violin
skale
booming
voice
miriam
gentle
tones
and
his
own
plaintive
yet
excited
note
while
outside
the
old
grey
walls
the
air
was
ever
alive
with
the
sighing
of
the
winds
and
the
ceaseless
murmur
of
falling
water
even
at
night
the
place
was
not
silent
he
understood
at
last
what
the
clergyman
had
told
him
that
perfect
silence
does
not
exist
the
universe
down
to
its
smallest
detail
sings
through
every
second
of
time
the
sounds
of
nature
especially
haunted
him
he
never
heard
the
wind
now
without
thinking
of
lost
whispers
from
the
voice
of
god
that
had
strayed
down
upon
the
world
to
sweeten
and
bewilder
the
hearts
of
men
whispers
for
listeners
simple
enough
to
understand
and
when
their
walks
took
them
as
far
as
the
sea
the
dirge
of
the
waves
troubled
his
soul
with
a
kind
of
distressing
exaltation
that
afflicted
the
very
deeps
of
his
being
it
was
with
a
new
comprehension
he
understood
his
dictum
that
the
keynote
of
external
nature
was
middle
f
this
employer
who
himself
possessed
that
psychic
sense
of
absolute
pitch
and
that
the
roar
of
a
city
wind
in
forest
trees
the
cry
of
trains
the
rushing
of
rivers
and
falling
water
niagara
itself
all
produced
this
single
utterance
and
he
loved
to
sing
it
on
the
moors
miriam
laughing
by
his
side
and
to
realize
that
the
world
literally
sang
with
them
behind
all
sounds
he
divined
for
the
first
time
a
majesty
that
appalled
his
imagination
glorified
by
skale
instantly
fell
to
constructing
the
forms
they
bodied
forth
out
of
doors
the
flutes
of
pan
cried
to
him
to
dance
indoors
the
echoes
of
yet
greater
music
whispered
in
the
penetralia
of
his
spirit
that
he
should
cry
in
this
extraordinary
new
world
of
philip
skale
revelation
he
fairly
spun
it
was
one
thing
when
the
protective
presence
of
the
clergyman
was
about
him
or
when
he
was
sustained
by
the
excitement
of
enthusiasm
but
when
he
was
alone
at
his
normal
level
timid
yet
adventurous
the
too
vivid
sense
of
these
new
things
made
him
tremble
the
terrifying
beauty
of
skale
ideas
the
realization
in
cold
blood
that
all
forms
in
the
world
about
him
were
silently
and
might
any
moment
vanish
and
release
their
huge
bodies
into
primal
sounds
that
the
stones
in
the
road
the
peaked
hills
the
very
earth
herself
might
alter
in
shape
before
his
eyes
on
the
other
hand
that
the
viewless
forces
of
life
and
death
might
leap
into
visibility
and
form
with
the
calling
of
their
names
that
himself
and
skale
and
mawle
and
that
pale
fairy
were
all
enmeshed
in
the
same
scheme
with
plants
insects
animals
and
planets
and
that
god
voice
was
everywhere
too
sublimely
close
all
this
when
he
was
alone
oppressed
him
with
a
sense
of
things
that
were
too
intimate
and
too
mighty
for
daily
life
in
these
moments
so
frequent
now
as
to
be
almost
continuous
he
preferred
the
safety
of
his
ordinary
and
normal
existence
dull
though
it
might
be
the
limited
personality
he
had
been
so
anxious
to
escape
from
seemed
wondrous
sweet
and
comforting
the
terror
of
the
approaching
experiment
with
this
mighty
name
appalled
him
the
forces
thus
battling
within
his
soul
became
more
and
more
contradictory
and
confused
the
outcome
for
himself
seemed
to
be
the
result
of
the
least
little
pressure
this
way
or
that
possibly
at
the
very
last
moment
too
which
way
the
waiting
climax
might
draw
him
was
a
question
impossible
to
decide
iii
and
then
suddenly
the
whole
portentous
business
moved
a
sharp
stage
nearer
that
hidden
climax
when
one
afternoon
skale
came
up
unexpectedly
behind
him
and
laid
a
great
hand
upon
his
shoulder
in
a
way
that
made
him
positively
jump
spinrobin
he
said
in
those
masterful
resonant
tones
that
shamed
his
timidity
and
cowardice
are
you
ready
for
anything
and
everything
was
the
immediate
reply
given
almost
automatically
as
he
felt
the
clergyman
forces
flood
into
his
soul
and
lift
him
the
time
is
at
hand
then
continued
the
other
leading
his
companion
by
the
arm
to
a
deep
leather
sofa
for
you
to
know
certain
things
that
for
your
own
safety
and
ours
i
was
obliged
to
keep
hidden
till
now
first
among
which
is
the
fact
that
this
house
is
not
as
you
supposed
empty
prepared
as
he
was
for
some
surprising
announcement
spinrobin
nevertheless
started
it
was
so
abrupt
not
empty
he
repeated
eager
to
hear
more
yet
quaking
he
had
never
forgotten
the
nightly
sounds
and
steps
in
his
own
passage
the
rooms
beyond
your
own
said
skale
with
a
solemnity
that
amounted
to
reverence
are
occupied
by
gasped
the
secretary
captured
sounds
gigantic
was
the
reply
uttered
almost
below
the
breath
the
two
men
looked
steadily
at
one
another
for
the
space
of
several
seconds
spinrobin
charged
to
the
brim
with
anxious
questions
pressing
somehow
upon
the
fringe
of
life
and
death
skale
obviously
calculating
how
much
he
might
reveal
or
how
little
spinrobin
he
said
presently
holding
him
firmly
with
his
eyes
you
are
aware
by
this
time
that
what
i
seek
is
the
correct
pronunciation
of
certain
names
of
a
certain
name
let
us
say
and
that
so
complex
is
the
nature
of
this
name
that
no
single
voice
can
utter
it
i
need
a
chord
a
human
chord
of
four
voices
spinrobin
bowed
after
years
of
research
and
experiment
resumed
the
clergyman
i
have
found
the
first
three
notes
and
now
in
your
own
person
has
come
my
supreme
happiness
in
the
discovery
of
the
fourth
what
i
now
wish
you
to
know
though
i
can
not
expect
you
to
understand
it
all
at
first
is
that
the
name
i
seek
is
broken
up
into
four
great
divisions
of
sound
and
that
to
each
of
these
separate
divisions
the
four
notes
of
our
chord
form
introductory
channels
when
the
time
comes
to
utter
it
each
one
of
us
will
call
the
syllable
or
sound
that
awakens
the
mighty
response
in
one
of
these
immense
and
terrific
divisions
so
that
the
whole
name
will
vibrate
as
a
single
chord
sung
perfectly
in
tune
skale
paused
and
drew
deep
breaths
this
approach
to
his
great
experiment
even
in
speech
seemed
to
exhaust
him
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
call
upon
reserves
of
force
that
lay
beneath
his
whole
manner
betrayed
the
gravity
the
reverence
the
mingled
respect
and
excitement
of
death
and
the
simple
truth
is
that
at
the
moment
spinrobin
could
not
find
in
himself
sufficient
courage
to
ask
what
this
fearful
and
prodigious
name
might
be
even
to
put
ordinary
questions
about
the
four
rooms
was
a
little
beyond
him
for
his
heart
beat
like
a
hammer
against
his
ribs
and
he
heard
its
ominous
drum
sounding
through
both
his
temples
and
in
each
of
the
rooms
in
your
corridor
ready
to
leap
forth
when
called
lie
the
sounds
or
voices
i
have
captured
and
imprisoned
these
separate
chambers
being
sheeted
and
prepared
huge
wax
receptacles
in
fact
akin
to
the
cylinders
of
the
phonograph
together
with
the
form
or
pattern
belonging
to
them
and
the
color
there
they
lie
at
present
in
silence
and
invisibility
just
as
the
universe
lay
in
silence
and
invisibility
before
the
word
of
god
called
it
into
objective
being
but
them
and
they
are
all
these
weeks
so
close
to
me
whispered
spinrobin
too
low
for
skale
to
notice
then
the
clergyman
leaned
over
towards
him
these
captured
sounds
are
as
yet
by
no
means
complete
he
said
through
his
beard
as
though
afraid
to
admit
it
for
all
i
have
of
them
really
is
their
initial
letters
of
their
forms
the
merest
faint
outlines
and
of
their
colors
but
a
first
suggestion
and
we
must
be
careful
we
must
be
absolutely
wise
to
utter
them
correctly
will
mean
to
transfer
to
us
the
qualities
of
gods
whereas
to
utter
falsely
may
mean
to
release
upon
the
surface
of
the
world
forces
that
he
shrugged
his
great
shoulders
and
an
ashen
pallor
spread
downwards
over
the
face
to
the
very
lips
the
sentence
remained
unfinished
and
its
very
incompleteness
left
spinrobin
with
the
most
grievous
agony
of
apprehension
he
had
yet
experienced
so
that
if
you
are
ready
our
next
step
shall
be
to
show
you
the
room
in
which
your
own
particular
sound
lies
added
skale
after
a
long
pause
the
sound
in
the
chord
it
will
be
your
privilege
to
utter
when
the
time
comes
for
each
of
us
will
utter
his
or
her
particular
letter
the
four
together
making
up
the
first
syllable
in
the
name
i
seek
skale
looked
steadily
down
into
the
wide
blue
eyes
of
his
companion
and
for
some
minutes
neither
of
them
spoke
the
letter
i
am
to
utter
repeated
the
secretary
at
length
the
letter
in
some
great
name
skale
smiled
upon
him
with
the
mighty
triumph
of
the
promethean
idea
in
his
eyes
the
room
he
muttered
deeply
and
softly
in
which
it
lies
waiting
for
you
to
claim
it
at
the
appointed
time
the
room
where
you
shall
learn
its
color
become
attuned
to
its
great
vibratory
activity
see
its
form
and
its
power
in
your
own
person
again
they
looked
long
into
one
another
eyes
i
game
murmured
spinrobin
almost
inaudibly
i
game
mr
skale
but
as
he
said
it
something
in
his
round
head
turned
dizzy
while
his
thoughts
flew
to
miriam
and
to
the
clergyman
significant
phrase
of
a
few
minutes
ago
we
must
be
careful
we
must
be
absolutely
wise
iv
and
the
preparation
the
clergyman
insisted
upon
detailed
thorough
and
scrupulous
certainly
did
not
lessen
in
spinrobin
eyes
the
gravity
of
the
approaching
ordeal
they
spent
two
days
and
nights
in
the
very
precise
and
punctilious
study
and
utterance
of
the
hebrew
names
of
the
angels
that
is
forces
whose
qualities
were
essential
to
their
safety
also
at
the
same
time
they
fasted
but
when
the
time
came
for
the
formal
visit
to
those
closed
rooms
of
which
the
locked
doors
were
like
veils
in
a
temple
spinrobin
declares
it
made
him
think
of
some
solemn
procession
down
ancient
passageways
of
crypt
or
pyramid
to
the
hidden
places
where
inscrutable
secrets
lay
it
was
certainly
thrilling
and
impressive
skale
went
first
moving
slowly
with
big
strides
grave
as
death
and
so
profoundly
convinced
of
the
momentous
nature
of
their
errand
that
an
air
of
dignity
and
of
dark
adventure
almost
majestic
hung
about
his
figure
the
long
corridor
that
dreary
december
morning
stretched
into
a
world
of
shadows
and
about
down
it
he
halted
in
front
of
a
door
next
but
one
to
room
and
turned
towards
his
companion
spinrobin
in
a
mood
to
see
anything
yet
striving
to
hide
behind
one
of
those
bushes
as
it
were
kept
his
distance
a
little
but
skale
took
him
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
forward
to
his
side
slowly
he
stooped
till
the
great
bearded
lips
were
level
with
his
ear
and
whispered
solemnly
blessed
are
the
pure
in
heart
for
they
shall
see
and
god
then
he
turned
the
key
and
led
the
way
inside
but
apparently
there
were
double
doors
for
they
found
themselves
at
first
in
a
space
that
formed
a
tiny
vestibule
to
the
room
itself
and
here
there
was
light
enough
to
see
that
the
clergyman
was
taking
from
nails
on
the
wall
two
long
garments
like
surplices
colored
so
far
as
spinrobin
could
make
out
a
deep
red
and
a
deep
violet
for
our
protection
whispered
skale
enveloping
himself
in
the
red
one
while
he
handed
the
other
to
his
companion
and
helped
him
into
it
wear
it
closely
about
your
body
until
we
come
out
and
while
the
secretary
struggled
among
the
folds
of
this
garment
that
was
several
feet
too
long
for
his
diminutive
stature
the
clergyman
added
still
with
a
gravity
and
earnestness
that
impressed
the
imagination
beyond
all
reach
of
the
ludicrous
for
sound
and
color
are
intimately
associated
and
there
are
combinations
of
the
two
that
can
throw
the
spiritual
body
into
a
condition
of
safe
receptivity
without
which
we
should
be
deaf
and
blind
even
in
the
great
presences
themselves
trivial
details
presenting
themselves
in
really
dramatic
moments
may
impress
the
mind
with
extraordinary
aptness
at
this
very
moment
spinrobin
eyes
noticed
in
the
corner
of
wall
and
door
a
tiny
web
with
the
spider
itself
hanging
in
the
center
of
its
little
net
shaking
and
he
has
never
forgotten
it
it
expressed
pictorially
exactly
what
he
felt
himself
he
too
felt
that
he
was
shaking
in
midair
as
in
the
center
of
a
web
whose
strands
hung
suspended
from
the
very
stars
and
the
words
spoken
in
that
slow
deep
whisper
filled
the
little
space
in
which
the
two
men
stood
and
somehow
completed
for
spinrobin
the
sense
of
stupendous
things
adequately
approached
then
skale
closed
the
outer
door
shutting
out
the
last
feeble
glimmer
of
day
at
the
same
moment
turning
the
handle
of
the
portal
beyond
and
as
they
entered
the
darkness
spinrobin
holding
up
his
violet
robe
with
one
hand
to
prevent
tripping
with
the
other
caught
hold
of
the
tail
of
the
flowing
garment
in
front
of
him
for
a
second
or
two
he
stopped
breathing
altogether
v
on
the
very
threshold
a
soft
murmur
of
beauty
met
them
and
as
plainly
as
though
the
darkness
had
lifted
into
a
blaze
of
light
the
secretary
at
once
realized
that
he
stood
in
the
presence
of
something
greater
than
all
he
had
hitherto
known
in
this
world
he
had
managed
to
find
the
clergyman
big
hand
and
he
held
it
tightly
through
a
twisted
corner
of
his
voluminous
robe
the
inner
door
next
closed
behind
them
skale
he
was
aware
had
again
stooped
in
the
darkness
to
the
level
of
his
ear
i
give
you
the
sound
the
note
he
heard
him
whisper
utter
it
inwardly
in
your
thoughts
only
its
vibrations
correspond
to
the
color
and
will
protect
us
protect
us
gasped
spinrobin
with
dry
lips
from
being
shattered
and
destroyed
owing
to
the
intense
activity
of
the
vibrations
conveyed
to
our
ultimate
physical
atoms
was
the
whispered
reply
as
the
clergyman
proceeded
to
give
him
under
his
breath
a
sound
that
was
unlike
any
word
he
knew
and
that
for
the
life
of
him
he
has
never
been
able
to
reproduce
since
skale
straightened
himself
up
again
and
spinrobin
pictured
him
standing
there
twice
his
natural
size
a
huge
and
impressive
figure
as
he
had
once
before
seen
him
clothed
now
with
the
double
dignity
of
his
strange
knowledge
then
advancing
slowly
to
the
center
of
the
room
they
stood
still
each
uttering
silently
in
his
thoughts
the
syllable
that
attuned
their
inner
beings
to
safety
almost
immediately
as
the
seconds
passed
the
secretary
became
aware
that
the
room
was
beginning
to
shake
with
a
powerful
but
regular
movement
all
about
him
had
become
alive
vitality
like
the
vitality
of
youth
upon
mountain
tops
pulsed
and
whirled
about
them
pouring
into
them
the
currents
of
a
rushing
glorious
life
undiluted
straight
from
the
source
in
his
little
person
he
felt
both
the
keenness
of
sharp
steel
and
the
vast
momentum
of
a
whole
ocean
thus
he
describes
it
and
the
more
clearly
he
uttered
in
his
thoughts
the
sound
given
to
him
by
his
leader
the
greater
seemed
the
influx
of
strength
and
glory
into
his
heart
the
darkness
meanwhile
began
to
lift
it
moved
upwards
in
spirals
that
as
they
rose
hummed
and
sang
a
soft
blaze
of
violet
like
the
color
of
the
robe
he
wore
became
faintly
visible
in
the
air
the
chamber
he
perceived
was
about
the
same
size
as
his
own
bedroom
and
empty
of
all
furniture
while
walls
floor
and
ceiling
were
draped
in
the
same
shade
of
violet
that
covered
his
shoulders
and
the
sound
he
uttered
called
forth
the
color
and
made
it
swim
into
visibility
the
walls
and
ceiling
sheeted
with
wax
opened
so
to
speak
their
giant
lips
skale
made
a
movement
and
drew
him
closer
he
raised
one
arm
into
the
air
and
spinrobin
following
the
motion
saw
what
at
first
he
imagined
to
be
vast
round
faces
glimmering
overhead
outlined
darkly
against
the
violet
atmosphere
skale
with
what
seemed
a
horrible
audacity
was
reaching
up
to
touch
them
and
as
he
did
so
there
issued
a
low
soft
metallic
sound
humming
and
melodious
that
dropped
sweetly
about
his
ears
then
the
secretary
saw
that
they
were
discs
of
metal
immense
gongs
swinging
in
midair
suspended
in
some
way
from
the
ceiling
and
each
one
as
skale
touched
it
emitted
its
beautiful
note
till
all
combined
together
at
length
into
a
single
chord
and
this
chord
though
spinrobin
talks
whole
pages
in
describing
it
apparently
brought
in
its
train
the
swell
and
thunder
of
something
beyond
the
far
sweetness
of
exquisite
harmonics
thousands
upon
thousands
inwoven
with
the
strands
of
deeper
notes
that
boomed
with
colossal
vibrations
about
them
and
in
some
fashion
that
musical
people
will
understand
its
gentler
notes
caught
up
the
sound
that
spinrobin
was
uttering
in
his
mind
and
took
possession
of
it
they
merged
an
extraordinary
volume
suggesting
a
huge
aggregation
of
sound
behind
it
in
the
same
way
that
a
murmur
of
wind
may
suggest
the
roar
of
tempests
rose
and
fell
through
the
room
lifted
them
up
bore
them
away
sang
majestically
over
their
heads
under
their
feet
and
through
their
very
minds
the
vibrations
of
their
own
physical
atoms
fell
into
pace
with
these
other
spiritual
activities
by
a
kind
of
sympathetic
resonance
the
combination
of
power
and
simplicity
was
what
impressed
him
most
it
seems
for
it
resembled
resembled
only
the
great
spiritual
simplicity
in
beethoven
that
rouses
and
at
the
same
time
satisfies
the
profoundest
yearnings
of
the
soul
it
swept
him
into
utter
bliss
into
something
for
once
complete
and
spinrobin
at
the
center
of
his
glorified
yet
quaking
little
heart
understood
vaguely
that
the
sound
he
uttered
and
the
sound
he
heard
were
directly
connected
with
the
presence
of
some
august
and
awful
name
vi
suddenly
skale
he
was
aware
became
rigid
beside
him
spinrobin
pressed
closer
seeking
the
protective
warmth
of
his
body
and
realizing
from
the
gesture
that
something
new
was
about
to
happen
and
something
did
happen
though
not
precisely
in
the
sense
that
things
happen
in
the
streets
and
in
the
markets
of
men
in
the
sphere
of
his
mind
perhaps
it
happened
but
was
none
the
less
real
for
that
for
the
presence
he
had
been
aware
of
in
the
room
from
the
moment
of
entrance
became
then
suddenly
almost
concrete
it
came
closer
sheeted
in
wonder
inscrutable
the
form
and
body
of
the
sounds
that
filled
the
air
pressed
forward
into
partial
visibility
spinrobin
powers
of
interior
sight
he
dimly
realized
increased
at
the
same
time
vast
as
a
mountain
as
a
whole
range
of
mountains
beautiful
as
a
star
as
a
whole
heaven
of
stars
yet
simple
as
a
flower
of
the
field
and
singing
this
little
song
of
pure
glory
and
joy
that
he
felt
was
the
inmost
message
of
the
chord
this
presence
in
the
room
sought
to
push
forward
into
objective
reality
and
behind
it
he
knew
lay
the
stupendous
urgency
and
drive
of
some
power
that
held
the
entire
universe
in
its
pulses
as
easily
as
the
ocean
holds
a
shoal
of
minnows
but
the
limits
of
realization
for
him
were
almost
reached
spinrobin
wanted
to
close
his
eyes
yet
could
not
he
was
driven
along
with
the
wave
of
sound
thus
awakened
and
forced
to
see
what
was
to
be
seen
this
time
there
was
no
bush
behind
which
he
could
screen
himself
and
there
dimly
sketched
out
of
the
rhythmical
vibrations
of
the
seething
violet
obscurity
rose
that
looming
outline
of
wonder
and
majesty
that
clothed
itself
about
them
with
a
garment
as
of
visible
sound
the
unknown
suggesting
incredible
dimensions
stood
at
his
elbow
tremendously
draped
in
these
dim
voluminous
folds
of
music
and
color
very
fearful
very
seductive
yet
so
supremely
simple
at
the
same
time
that
a
little
child
could
have
understood
without
fear
but
only
partially
there
only
partially
revealed
the
ineffable
glory
was
never
quite
told
spinrobin
amid
all
the
torrent
of
words
in
which
he
sought
later
to
describe
the
experience
could
only
falter
out
a
single
comprehensible
sentence
i
felt
like
stammering
in
intoxication
over
the
first
letter
of
a
name
i
loved
loved
to
the
point
of
ecstasy
to
the
point
even
of
giving
up
my
life
for
it
and
meanwhile
breathless
and
shaking
he
clung
to
skale
still
murmuring
in
his
heart
the
magic
syllable
but
swept
into
some
region
of
glory
where
pain
and
joy
both
ceased
where
terror
and
delight
merged
into
some
perfectly
simple
form
of
love
and
where
he
became
in
an
instant
of
time
an
entirely
new
and
emancipated
spinrobin
driving
at
full
speed
towards
the
ultimate
sound
and
secret
of
the
universe
god
he
never
remembered
exactly
how
he
got
out
of
the
room
but
it
always
seemed
as
though
he
dropped
with
a
crash
from
some
enormous
height
the
sounds
ceased
the
gongs
died
into
silence
the
violet
faded
the
quivering
wax
lay
still
skale
was
moving
beside
him
and
the
next
minute
they
were
in
the
narrow
vestibule
between
the
doors
hanging
up
ordinary
colored
surplices
upon
ordinary
iron
nails
spinrobin
stumbled
skale
caught
him
they
were
in
the
corridor
again
cold
cheerless
full
of
december
murk
and
shadows
and
the
secretary
was
leaning
against
the
clergyman
shoulder
breathless
and
trembling
as
though
he
had
run
a
mile
chapter
xi
i
and
the
color
of
sound
is
a
pale
green
he
heard
behind
him
in
tones
as
sweet
as
a
muted
violin
string
while
the
form
of
my
note
fits
into
yours
just
like
a
glove
dear
spinny
do
tremble
so
we
shall
always
be
together
remember
you
and
i
and
when
turning
he
saw
miriam
at
his
side
radiant
with
her
shining
little
smile
of
welcome
the
relief
was
so
great
that
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
would
not
let
her
go
she
drew
him
tenderly
away
downstairs
for
the
clergyman
it
seemed
was
still
busy
with
something
in
the
room
and
had
left
them
know
know
she
said
softly
making
him
sit
down
beside
her
on
the
sofa
i
know
the
rush
of
pain
and
happiness
it
brings
it
shifts
the
whole
key
of
your
life
does
it
when
i
first
went
into
my
and
learned
the
letter
i
was
to
utter
in
the
name
i
felt
as
if
i
could
never
come
back
to
ordinary
things
again
or
what
name
interrupted
spinrobin
drawing
sharply
away
from
her
and
the
same
second
amazed
at
the
recklessness
that
had
prompted
the
one
question
he
dreaded
the
inevitable
reaction
had
come
he
realized
for
the
first
time
that
there
an
alternative
all
the
passion
of
battle
was
upon
him
the
terrific
splendors
of
skale
possible
achievement
dazzled
the
very
windows
of
his
soul
but
at
the
same
time
the
sweet
uses
of
normal
human
life
called
searchingly
to
him
from
within
he
had
been
circling
about
this
fight
for
days
at
last
it
was
unexpectedly
upon
him
he
might
climb
to
skale
impossible
heaven
skale
outrageous
heaven
on
the
wings
of
this
portentous
experience
or
he
might
sink
back
into
the
stream
of
wholesome
and
commonplace
life
with
a
delicious
little
human
love
to
companion
him
across
the
years
the
unsoiled
love
of
an
embryonic
soul
that
he
could
train
practically
from
birth
miriam
was
beside
him
soft
and
yielding
ready
doubtless
to
be
molded
for
either
path
what
name
he
repeated
holding
his
breath
once
the
words
were
out
name
of
course
she
answered
gently
smiling
up
into
his
eyes
the
name
i
have
lived
to
know
and
that
you
came
here
to
learn
so
that
when
our
voices
sing
and
utter
it
together
in
the
chord
we
shall
both
become
spinrobin
set
his
mouth
against
her
own
to
stop
her
speech
she
yielded
to
him
with
her
whole
little
body
her
eyes
smiled
the
great
human
welcome
as
she
stared
so
closely
into
his
shall
become
what
we
are
not
now
he
cried
fiercely
drawing
his
face
back
but
holding
her
body
yet
more
closely
to
him
lose
each
other
do
you
see
do
you
realize
that
no
no
she
said
faintly
find
each
other
you
mean
yes
if
all
goes
well
he
spoke
the
words
very
low
for
perhaps
thirty
seconds
they
stared
most
searchingly
into
each
other
eyes
drawing
slightly
apart
very
slowly
her
face
then
went
exceedingly
pale
all
goes
she
repeated
horrified
then
after
a
pause
she
added
you
mean
that
he
might
make
a
mistake
or
and
spinrobin
drinking
in
the
sweet
breath
that
bore
the
words
so
softly
from
her
lips
answered
measuring
his
words
with
ponderous
gravity
as
though
each
conveyed
a
sentence
of
life
or
death
all
goes
she
watched
him
with
something
of
that
utter
clinging
in
her
eyes
that
claims
any
degree
of
suffering
gladly
rather
than
the
loss
of
her
own
passionately
welcoming
misery
in
preference
to
loss
she
too
had
divined
the
alternative
then
kissing
his
cheeks
and
eyes
and
lips
she
untied
his
arms
from
about
her
neck
and
ran
blushing
furiously
from
the
room
and
with
her
went
doubt
for
the
first
time
doubt
as
to
the
success
of
the
great
experiment
doubt
as
to
their
leader
power
ii
and
while
spinrobin
still
sat
there
trembling
with
the
two
passions
that
tore
his
soul
in
twain
the
passion
to
climb
forbidden
skies
with
skale
and
the
passion
to
know
sweet
human
love
with
miriam
there
came
thundering
into
the
room
no
less
a
personage
than
the
giant
clergyman
straight
from
those
haunted
rooms
pallor
hung
about
his
face
but
there
was
a
light
radiating
through
it
a
high
luminous
whiteness
that
made
the
secretary
think
of
his
childhood
pictures
of
the
hebrew
prophet
descending
from
mount
sinai
the
glory
of
internal
spheres
still
reflected
upon
the
skin
and
eyes
skale
like
a
flame
and
a
wind
came
pouring
into
the
room
the
thing
he
had
remained
upstairs
to
complete
had
clearly
proved
successful
the
experiment
had
moved
another
stage
almost
the
final
one
nearer
accomplishment
the
reaction
was
genuinely
terrific
spinrobin
felt
himself
swept
away
beyond
all
power
of
redemption
miriam
and
the
delicious
human
life
faded
into
insignificance
again
what
in
the
name
of
the
eternal
fires
were
a
girl
lips
and
love
compared
to
the
possibilities
of
olympian
achievement
promised
by
skale
golden
audacities
earth
faded
before
the
lights
of
heaven
the
whole
tide
of
human
emotion
was
nothing
compared
to
a
drop
of
this
terrible
salt
brine
from
seas
in
unknown
stars
as
usual
skale
personality
caught
him
up
into
some
seventh
heaven
of
the
soaring
imagination
spinrobin
my
glorious
companion
in
adventure
thundered
the
clergyman
your
note
suits
perfectly
the
chord
i
am
delighted
beyond
all
words
you
chime
with
amazing
precision
and
accuracy
into
the
complex
i
need
for
the
proper
pronunciation
of
the
name
your
coming
has
been
an
inspiration
permitted
of
him
who
owns
it
his
excitement
was
profoundly
moving
the
man
was
in
earnest
if
ever
man
was
we
shall
succeed
and
he
caught
him
in
his
arms
for
the
name
manifests
the
essential
attributes
of
the
being
it
describes
and
in
uttering
it
we
shall
know
mystical
union
with
it
we
shall
be
as
gods
splendid
splendid
exclaimed
spinrobin
utterly
carried
away
by
this
spiritual
enthusiasm
i
will
follow
you
to
the
end
iii
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
when
framed
in
the
doorway
delicate
and
seductive
as
a
witch
again
stood
miriam
then
moved
softly
forward
into
the
room
her
face
was
pale
as
the
grave
her
little
delicate
mouth
was
set
with
resolution
clearly
she
had
overheard
but
clearly
also
she
had
used
the
interval
for
serious
reflection
we
can
not
possibly
can
we
she
asked
gliding
up
like
a
frightened
fawn
to
the
clergyman
side
he
turned
upon
her
stern
even
terrible
so
relentless
was
his
swift
appearance
so
implacable
in
purpose
that
spinrobin
felt
the
sudden
impulse
to
fly
to
her
assistance
but
instantly
his
great
visage
broke
into
a
smile
like
the
smile
of
thunderous
clouds
when
unexpectedly
the
sun
breaks
through
then
quickly
hides
itself
again
everywhere
he
roared
true
things
are
great
and
clean
have
faith
have
faith
and
he
looked
upon
them
both
as
though
his
eyes
would
sweep
from
their
petty
souls
all
vestige
of
what
was
afraid
and
immature
we
all
are
pure
we
all
are
true
each
calls
his
note
in
singleness
of
heart
we
can
not
fail
and
just
here
spinrobin
a
little
beyond
himself
with
excitement
probably
pattered
across
the
room
to
his
giant
leader
side
and
peered
up
into
his
visage
he
stood
on
tiptoe
craning
his
neck
forwards
then
spoke
very
low
i
have
the
right
have
the
right
for
i
have
earned
it
to
be
taken
now
fully
into
confidence
and
to
know
everything
came
the
words
and
the
reply
simple
and
immediate
that
dropped
back
upon
him
through
all
that
tangle
of
ragged
beard
was
brief
and
to
the
point
you
have
listen
then
and
he
led
them
both
by
the
hand
like
two
children
towards
the
sofa
and
then
standing
over
them
began
to
speak
iv
i
seek
he
said
slowly
and
gravely
the
correct
utterance
of
a
certain
mighty
and
ineffable
name
and
in
each
of
those
four
rooms
lies
a
letter
of
its
first
syllable
for
all
these
years
of
research
his
voice
dropped
suddenly
have
only
brought
me
to
that
the
first
syllable
and
the
name
itself
is
composed
of
four
each
more
mighty
than
the
last
a
violent
trembling
ran
over
both
listeners
spinrobin
holding
a
cold
little
hand
in
his
dreaded
unuttered
sentences
for
if
mere
letters
could
spell
so
vast
a
message
what
must
be
the
meaning
of
a
whole
syllable
and
what
the
dire
content
of
the
completed
name
itself
yes
skale
went
on
with
a
reverence
born
of
profoundest
awe
the
captured
sounds
i
hold
are
but
the
opening
vibrations
of
this
tremendous
name
and
the
task
is
of
such
magnitude
that
absolute
courage
and
absolute
faith
are
essential
for
the
sounds
are
themselves
creative
sounds
and
the
consequences
in
case
of
faulty
utterance
might
be
too
appalling
to
contemplate
creative
fell
from
the
little
man
on
the
sofa
aghast
at
the
possibility
yet
the
one
burning
question
that
lay
trembling
just
behind
his
lips
dared
not
frame
itself
in
words
for
there
was
something
in
skale
face
and
manner
that
rendered
the
asking
of
it
not
yet
possible
the
revelation
of
the
name
must
wait
even
singly
as
you
saw
their
power
is
terrific
he
went
on
ignoring
the
pathetic
interruption
but
united
as
we
shall
unite
them
while
each
of
us
utters
his
letter
and
summons
forth
the
entire
syllable
by
means
of
the
chord
they
will
constitute
a
word
of
power
which
shall
make
us
as
gods
if
uttered
correctly
if
incorrectly
shall
pour
from
this
house
to
consume
and
alter
the
surface
of
the
entire
world
with
the
destructive
tempest
due
to
mispronunciation
and
a
lie
miriam
nestled
closer
into
her
companion
side
there
was
otherwise
no
sign
outwardly
of
the
emotions
that
surged
through
the
two
little
figures
upon
the
sofa
and
now
now
that
you
have
this
first
syllable
complete
faltered
a
high
and
sharing
tenor
voice
we
must
transfer
it
to
a
home
where
it
shall
wait
in
silence
and
in
safety
until
we
have
also
captured
the
other
remaining
three
skale
came
forward
and
lowered
his
mouth
to
his
companions
ears
we
shall
transfer
it
as
you
now
understand
by
chanting
the
four
letters
our
living
chord
will
summon
forth
that
first
syllable
into
visible
form
and
shape
our
four
voices
thus
trained
and
purified
each
singing
a
mighty
letter
shall
create
the
astounding
pattern
of
the
name
first
syllable
but
the
home
stammered
spinrobin
this
home
where
it
shall
await
the
rest
my
rooms
was
the
reply
can
contain
letters
only
for
a
whole
syllable
i
need
a
larger
space
in
the
cellars
beneath
this
house
i
have
the
necessary
space
all
ready
and
prepared
to
hold
this
first
syllable
while
we
work
upon
the
second
come
and
you
shall
see
they
crossed
the
hall
and
went
down
the
long
stone
passage
beyond
the
dining
room
till
they
reached
a
swinging
baize
door
and
so
came
to
the
dark
stairs
that
plunged
below
ground
skale
strode
first
spinrobin
following
with
beating
heart
he
held
miriam
by
the
hand
his
steps
though
firm
enough
made
him
think
of
his
efforts
as
a
boy
when
treading
water
for
solid
ground
out
of
his
depth
v
cold
air
met
them
yet
it
was
neither
dank
nor
unpleasant
as
air
usually
is
that
has
never
tasted
sunlight
there
was
a
touch
of
vitality
about
it
wholly
remarkable
miriam
pressed
closer
every
detail
every
little
incident
that
brought
them
nearer
to
the
climax
was
now
interpreted
by
these
two
loving
children
as
something
that
might
eventually
spell
for
them
separation
yet
neither
referred
to
it
directly
the
pain
of
the
ultimate
choice
possessed
them
deep
within
here
exclaimed
the
clergyman
in
a
hushed
tone
that
yet
woke
echoes
on
all
sides
while
he
lit
a
candle
and
held
it
aloft
you
see
the
cellar
vaults
all
ready
for
the
first
great
syllable
when
our
chord
shall
bring
it
leaping
down
from
the
rooms
upstairs
here
will
reside
the
pattern
of
the
name
opening
syllable
till
we
shall
have
accomplished
the
construction
of
the
others
and
like
some
august
master
of
forbidden
ceremonies
looking
twice
his
natural
size
as
the
shadows
played
tricks
with
his
arms
and
shoulders
merging
his
outline
into
walls
and
ceiling
skale
stood
and
looked
about
him
spaces
stretched
away
on
all
sides
as
in
the
crypt
of
a
cathedral
most
beautifully
and
harmoniously
draped
with
the
separate
colors
of
the
four
rooms
red
yellow
violet
and
green
immense
gongs
connected
apparently
with
some
intricate
network
of
shining
wires
hung
suspended
in
midair
beneath
the
arches
rising
from
the
floor
were
gigantic
tuning
forks
erect
and
silent
immediately
behind
which
gaped
artificial
placed
to
increase
the
intensity
of
the
respective
notes
when
caught
and
in
the
dim
background
the
clergyman
pointed
out
an
elaborate
apparatus
for
quickly
altering
the
temperature
of
the
air
and
another
for
the
rapid
production
of
carbonic
acid
gas
since
by
means
of
a
lens
of
carbonic
acid
gas
sound
can
be
refracted
like
light
and
by
changing
the
temperature
of
the
air
that
conveys
it
sound
can
be
bent
also
like
a
ray
of
light
in
any
desired
direction
the
whole
cellar
seemed
in
some
way
to
sum
up
and
synthesize
the
distinctive
characteristics
of
the
four
rooms
over
it
all
sheeting
ceiling
and
walls
lay
the
living
and
receptive
wax
singularly
suggestive
too
was
the
appearance
of
those
huge
metal
discs
like
lifeless
dark
faces
waiting
the
signal
to
open
their
bronze
lips
and
cry
aloud
ready
for
the
advent
of
the
sound
that
should
give
them
birth
and
force
them
to
proclaim
their
mighty
secret
spinrobin
stared
silent
and
fascinated
almost
expecting
them
to
begin
there
and
then
their
dreadful
and
appalling
music
yet
the
place
was
undeniably
empty
no
ghost
of
a
sound
stirred
the
gorgeous
draperies
nothing
but
a
faint
metallic
whispering
seemed
to
breathe
out
from
the
big
discs
and
forks
and
wires
as
skale
voice
modulated
and
hushed
though
it
was
vibrated
gently
against
them
nothing
moved
nothing
uttered
nothing
lived
as
yet
destitute
of
all
presence
you
see
it
now
whispered
the
clergyman
shading
the
candle
with
one
huge
hand
though
before
long
when
we
transfer
our
great
captured
syllable
down
here
you
shall
know
it
alive
and
singing
with
a
thousand
thunders
the
letters
shall
not
escape
me
the
gongs
and
colors
correspond
exactly
they
will
retain
both
the
sounds
and
the
outlines
and
the
wax
is
sensitive
as
the
heart
of
a
child
and
his
big
face
shone
quite
dreadfully
as
the
whole
pomp
and
splendor
of
his
dream
come
true
set
fire
to
his
thoughts
but
spinrobin
was
glad
when
at
length
they
turned
and
moved
slowly
again
up
the
stone
steps
and
emerged
into
the
pale
december
daylight
that
dark
cellar
wired
draped
waxed
and
awaiting
its
mighty
occupant
filled
his
mind
with
too
vast
a
sensation
of
wonder
and
anticipation
for
peace
and
for
the
syllables
to
follow
skale
resumed
when
they
were
once
more
in
the
library
we
shall
want
spaces
larger
still
there
are
great
holes
in
these
hills
stretching
out
an
arm
to
indicate
the
mountains
above
the
house
and
down
yonder
in
the
heart
of
those
cliffs
by
the
sounding
sea
there
are
caverns
they
are
far
but
the
distance
is
of
no
consequence
they
will
serve
us
well
i
know
them
i
have
marked
them
they
are
ready
he
swept
his
beard
to
and
fro
with
one
hand
spinrobin
already
saw
those
holes
and
caverns
in
the
terms
of
sound
and
color
and
for
the
entire
name
when
completed
he
asked
knowing
that
the
question
was
but
a
feeble
substitute
for
that
other
one
he
burned
to
ask
yet
dared
not
allow
his
lips
to
utter
skale
turned
and
looked
at
him
he
raised
his
hands
aloft
his
voice
boomed
again
as
of
old
the
open
sky
he
cried
with
enthusiasm
the
vault
of
heaven
itself
for
no
solid
structure
exists
in
the
world
not
even
the
ribs
of
these
old
hills
that
could
withstand
the
power
of
that
of
that
eternal
and
terrific
spinrobin
leapt
to
his
feet
the
question
swept
from
his
lips
at
last
like
a
flame
miriam
clung
to
his
arm
trying
in
vain
to
stop
him
then
tell
me
he
cried
aloud
tell
me
you
great
blasphemer
whose
is
the
name
that
you
seek
to
utter
under
heaven
and
tell
me
why
it
is
my
soul
faints
and
is
so
fearfully
afraid
skale
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
as
a
man
might
look
at
some
trifling
phenomenon
of
life
that
puzzled
yet
interested
him
but
there
was
love
in
his
eyes
love
and
the
forgiveness
of
a
great
soul
spinrobin
afraid
at
his
own
audacity
met
his
eyes
recklessly
while
miriam
peered
from
one
to
the
other
perplexed
and
questioning
spinrobin
said
the
clergyman
at
length
in
a
voice
turned
soft
and
tender
with
compassion
the
name
i
seek
this
awful
name
we
may
all
eventually
utter
together
completely
formed
is
one
that
no
living
man
has
spoken
for
nigh
two
thousand
years
though
all
this
time
the
search
has
been
kept
alive
by
a
few
men
in
every
age
and
every
country
of
the
world
some
few
they
say
ah
yes
have
found
it
then
instantly
forgotten
it
again
for
once
pronounced
it
may
not
be
retained
but
goes
utterly
lost
to
the
memory
on
the
instant
only
once
so
far
as
we
may
know
he
lowered
his
voice
to
a
hushed
and
reverent
whisper
that
thrilled
about
them
in
the
air
like
the
throbbing
of
a
string
has
it
been
preserved
the
prophet
of
nazareth
purer
and
simpler
than
all
other
men
recovered
the
correct
utterance
of
the
first
two
syllables
and
swiftly
very
swiftly
phonetically
too
of
necessity
wrote
them
down
before
the
wondrous
memory
had
time
to
fade
then
sewed
the
piece
of
parchment
into
his
thigh
and
hence
power
all
his
life
it
is
a
name
he
continued
his
tone
rising
to
something
of
its
old
thunder
that
sounds
like
the
voice
of
many
waters
that
piles
the
ocean
into
standing
heaps
and
makes
the
high
hills
to
skip
like
little
lambs
it
is
a
name
the
ancient
hebrews
concealed
as
tetragrammaton
beneath
a
thousand
devices
the
name
they
said
that
through
the
universe
to
call
upon
which
that
is
to
utter
correctly
is
to
call
upon
that
name
which
is
far
above
all
others
that
can
be
named
he
paused
midway
in
the
growing
torrent
of
his
speech
and
lifted
his
companion
out
of
the
sofa
he
set
him
upon
his
feet
holding
both
his
hands
and
peering
deep
into
his
eyes
those
bewildered
yet
unflinching
blue
eyes
of
the
little
man
who
sought
terrific
adventure
as
an
escape
from
insignificance
to
know
which
he
added
in
a
sudden
awed
whisper
is
to
know
the
ultimate
secrets
of
life
and
death
and
to
read
the
riddle
of
the
world
and
the
soul
to
become
even
as
itself
gods
he
stopped
abruptly
and
again
that
awful
flaming
smile
ran
over
his
face
flushing
it
from
chin
to
forehead
with
the
power
of
his
burning
and
tremendous
belief
spinrobin
was
already
weeping
inwardly
without
sound
he
understood
at
last
only
too
well
what
was
coming
skale
expression
held
the
whole
wild
glory
and
the
whole
impious
audacity
of
what
seemed
his
blasphemous
spiritual
discovery
the
fires
were
alight
in
his
eyes
he
stooped
down
lower
and
opened
wide
his
capacious
arms
the
next
second
spinrobin
miriam
and
mawle
who
had
unexpectedly
come
upon
them
from
behind
were
gathered
all
together
against
his
breast
his
voice
then
dropped
suddenly
to
a
tiny
whisper
of
awful
joy
that
seemed
to
creep
from
his
lips
like
some
message
too
mighty
to
be
fully
known
and
half
lost
itself
among
the
strands
of
his
beard
my
wonderful
redeemed
children
notes
in
my
human
chord
he
whispered
over
their
heads
it
is
the
name
that
shall
make
us
as
god
for
it
is
none
other
than
the
name
that
rusheth
through
the
universe
his
breath
failed
him
most
curiously
for
an
instant
the
name
of
the
almighty
chapter
xii
i
a
certain
struggling
incoherence
is
manifest
in
spinrobin
report
of
it
all
as
of
a
man
striving
to
express
violent
thoughts
in
a
language
he
has
not
yet
mastered
it
is
evident
for
instance
as
those
few
familiar
with
the
magical
use
of
sound
in
ceremonial
and
the
power
that
resides
in
true
naming
will
realize
that
he
never
fully
understood
intended
use
of
the
chord
or
why
this
complex
sound
was
necessary
for
the
utterance
of
the
complex
name
moreover
the
powers
concealed
in
the
mere
letters
while
they
laid
hold
upon
his
imagination
never
fully
entered
his
understanding
few
minds
it
seems
can
conceive
of
any
deity
as
other
than
some
anthropomorphic
extension
of
themselves
for
the
idea
is
too
greatly
blinding
to
admit
human
thought
within
a
measurable
distance
even
of
a
faintest
conception
the
true
stupendous
nature
of
the
forces
these
letters
in
the
opening
syllable
clothed
spinrobin
unquestionably
never
apprehended
miriam
with
her
naked
and
undefiled
intuitions
due
to
utter
ignorance
of
worldly
things
from
birth
came
nearer
to
the
reality
but
then
miriam
was
now
daily
more
and
more
caught
up
into
the
vortex
of
a
sweet
and
compelling
human
love
and
in
proportion
as
this
grew
she
feared
the
great
experiment
that
might
so
spinrobin
had
suggested
spell
loss
gradually
dread
closed
the
avenues
of
her
spirit
that
led
so
fearfully
to
heaven
and
in
their
place
she
saw
the
dear
yet
thorny
paths
that
lay
with
spinny
upon
the
earth
they
no
longer
these
two
bewildered
loving
children
spoke
of
one
another
in
the
terminology
of
sound
and
music
he
no
longer
called
her
his
brilliant
little
sound
nor
did
she
respond
with
you
perfect
echo
they
fell
back
sign
of
a
gradual
concession
to
more
human
things
upon
the
gentler
terminology
if
the
phrase
may
be
allowed
of
winky
they
shared
winky
between
them
though
neither
one
nor
other
of
them
divined
yet
what
winky
actually
meant
in
their
lives
winky
is
yours
she
would
say
because
you
made
him
but
he
belongs
to
me
too
because
he
simply
ca
live
without
me
or
i
without
you
little
magic
he
whispered
laughing
tenderly
so
you
see
we
are
all
three
together
her
face
grew
slightly
troubled
he
only
pays
me
visits
though
sometimes
i
think
you
hide
him
or
tell
him
not
to
come
and
far
down
in
her
deep
grey
eyes
swam
the
first
moisture
of
rising
tears
do
you
my
wonderful
spinny
sometimes
i
forget
him
perhaps
he
replied
gravely
but
that
is
only
when
i
think
of
what
may
be
coming
if
the
experiment
succeeds
succeeds
she
exclaimed
you
mean
if
it
fails
her
voice
dropped
instinctively
and
they
looked
over
their
shoulders
to
make
sure
they
were
alone
he
came
up
very
close
to
her
and
spoke
in
her
small
pink
ear
if
it
succeeds
he
whispered
we
go
to
heaven
i
suppose
if
it
fails
we
stay
upon
the
earth
then
he
stood
off
holding
her
hands
at
length
and
gazing
down
upon
her
do
you
want
to
go
to
heaven
he
asked
very
deliberately
or
to
stay
here
upon
the
earth
with
me
and
winky
she
was
in
his
arms
the
same
second
laughing
and
crying
with
the
strange
conflict
of
new
and
inexplicable
emotions
i
want
to
be
with
you
here
and
forever
heaven
frightens
me
now
but
oh
spinny
dear
protecting
thing
i
want
i
also
want
she
broke
off
abruptly
and
spinrobin
unable
to
see
her
face
buried
against
his
shoulder
could
not
guess
whether
she
was
laughing
or
weeping
he
only
divined
that
something
in
her
heart
profound
as
life
itself
something
she
had
never
been
warned
to
conceal
was
clamoring
for
comprehension
and
satisfaction
miriam
tell
me
exactly
i
sure
i
shall
understand
i
want
winky
to
be
with
us
always
not
only
sometimes
on
little
visits
he
heard
between
the
broken
breathing
i
tell
him
but
there
no
good
telling
she
interrupted
almost
fiercely
it
is
you
must
tell
spinrobin
heart
sank
within
him
she
was
in
pain
and
he
could
not
quite
understand
he
pressed
her
hard
against
him
keeping
silence
presently
she
lifted
her
face
from
his
coat
and
he
saw
the
tears
of
mingled
pain
and
happiness
in
her
eyes
the
eyes
of
this
who
knew
not
the
common
ugly
standards
of
life
because
no
woman
had
ever
told
them
to
her
you
see
winky
is
not
really
mine
unless
i
have
some
share
in
making
him
too
she
said
very
softly
when
i
have
made
him
too
then
he
will
stay
forever
with
us
i
think
and
spinrobin
beginning
to
understand
knowing
within
him
that
singular
exultation
of
triumphant
love
which
comes
to
a
pure
man
when
he
meets
the
of
his
firstborn
lowered
his
own
face
very
reverently
to
hers
and
kissed
her
on
the
cheeks
and
eyes
saying
nothing
and
vaguely
wondering
whether
the
awful
name
that
skale
sought
with
so
much
thunder
and
lightning
did
not
lie
at
that
very
moment
sweetly
singing
its
divinest
message
between
the
contact
of
this
pair
of
youthful
lips
the
lips
of
himself
and
miriam
ii
and
philip
skale
meanwhile
splendid
and
independent
of
all
common
obstacles
thundered
along
his
tempestuous
mad
way
regardless
and
ignorant
of
all
signs
of
disaffection
the
rest
of
that
week
a
week
of
haunting
wonder
and
beauty
was
devoted
to
the
carrying
out
of
the
strange
program
it
is
not
possible
to
tell
in
detail
the
experience
of
each
separate
room
spinrobin
does
it
yet
only
succeeds
in
repeating
himself
and
as
has
been
seen
his
powers
failed
even
in
that
first
chamber
of
awe
the
language
does
not
exist
in
which
adventures
so
remote
from
normal
experience
can
be
clothed
without
straining
the
mind
to
the
verge
of
the
unintelligible
it
appears
however
that
each
room
possessed
its
color
note
and
form
which
later
were
to
issue
forth
and
combine
in
the
even
vaster
pattern
chord
and
outline
which
should
include
them
all
even
the
thought
of
it
strained
the
possibilities
of
belief
and
the
resources
of
the
imagination
his
soul
fluttered
and
shrank
they
continued
the
processes
of
prayer
and
fasting
skale
had
ordained
as
the
time
for
the
experiment
drew
near
and
the
careful
vibratory
utterance
of
the
word
belonging
to
each
room
the
vibrations
of
which
threw
their
inner
selves
into
a
condition
of
safe
or
comparatively
safe
receptivity
but
spinrobin
no
longer
said
his
prayers
for
the
thought
that
soon
he
was
to
call
upon
the
divine
and
mighty
name
in
reality
prevented
his
doing
so
in
the
old
way
of
childhood
nominally
he
feared
there
might
come
an
answer
he
literally
walked
the
dizzy
edge
of
precipices
that
dropped
over
the
edge
of
the
world
the
incoherence
of
all
this
traffic
with
sound
and
name
had
always
bewildered
him
even
to
the
point
of
darkness
whereas
now
it
did
more
it
appalled
him
in
some
sense
that
was
monstrous
and
terrifying
yet
while
weak
with
terror
when
he
tried
to
face
the
possible
results
and
fevered
with
the
notion
of
entering
some
new
condition
even
though
one
of
glory
where
miriam
might
no
longer
be
as
he
now
knew
her
it
was
the
savage
curiosity
he
felt
that
prevented
his
coming
to
a
definite
decision
and
telling
skale
that
he
withdrew
from
the
whole
affair
then
the
idea
grew
in
his
mind
that
the
clergyman
was
obsessed
by
some
perverted
spiritual
force
some
devil
who
deceived
him
and
that
the
name
he
sought
to
pronounce
was
after
all
not
good
not
god
his
thoughts
fears
hopes
all
became
hopelessly
entangled
through
them
one
thing
alone
holding
clear
and
steady
the
passionate
desire
to
keep
miriam
as
she
was
now
and
to
be
with
her
forever
his
mind
played
tricks
with
him
too
day
and
night
the
house
echoed
with
new
sounds
the
very
walls
grew
resonant
the
entire
building
buried
away
among
these
desolate
hills
trembled
as
though
he
were
imprisoned
within
the
belly
of
some
monstrous
and
gigantic
fiddle
skale
too
began
to
change
it
seemed
while
physically
he
increased
as
it
were
with
the
power
of
his
burning
enthusiasm
his
beard
longer
and
more
ragged
his
eyes
more
luminous
and
his
voice
shaking
through
the
atmosphere
almost
like
wind
his
personality
in
some
curious
fashion
seemed
at
the
same
time
to
retire
and
become
oddly
tinged
with
a
certain
remoteness
from
reality
spinrobin
once
or
twice
caught
himself
wondering
if
he
were
not
after
all
some
legendary
or
pagan
figure
some
mighty
character
of
dream
or
story
and
that
presently
he
spinrobin
would
awake
and
write
down
the
most
wonderful
vision
the
world
had
ever
known
his
imagination
it
will
be
seen
was
affected
in
more
ways
than
one
with
a
tremendous
earnestness
the
clergyman
went
about
the
building
down
the
long
dark
corridors
and
across
the
halls
his
long
soft
strides
took
him
swiftly
everywhere
his
mere
presence
charged
with
some
potent
force
that
betrayed
itself
in
the
fire
of
his
eyes
and
the
flush
of
his
cheeks
spinrobin
thought
of
him
as
some
daring
blasphemer
knocking
at
a
door
in
the
sky
the
sound
of
that
knocking
ran
all
about
the
universe
and
when
the
door
opened
the
heavens
would
roll
back
like
an
enormous
flat
curtain
any
moment
almost
skale
whispered
to
him
smiling
the
day
may
be
upon
us
keep
yourself
ready
and
in
tune
and
spinrobin
expecting
a
thunderclap
in
his
sleep
but
ever
plucky
answered
in
his
voice
i
ready
philip
skale
ready
i
game
too
when
truthfully
speaking
perhaps
he
was
neither
one
nor
other
he
would
start
up
from
sleep
in
the
nighttime
at
the
least
sound
and
the
roar
of
the
december
gales
about
the
house
became
voices
of
portent
that
conveyed
far
more
than
the
mere
rushing
of
inarticulate
winds
when
the
hour
comes
and
it
is
close
at
hand
we
shall
not
fail
to
know
it
said
skale
pallid
with
excitement
the
letters
will
be
out
upon
us
they
will
live
but
with
an
intense
degree
of
exuberant
life
far
beyond
what
we
know
as
life
we
in
our
puny
bodies
and
the
scorn
in
his
voice
came
from
the
center
of
his
heart
for
what
we
hear
as
sound
is
only
a
section
he
cried
only
a
section
of
as
they
exist
the
vibrations
our
ears
can
take
are
small
i
know
interpolated
spinrobin
cold
at
heart
while
miriam
hiding
behind
chairs
and
tables
that
offered
handy
protection
watched
with
mingled
anxiety
and
confidence
knowing
that
in
the
last
resort
her
adorable
and
wonderful
spinny
would
guide
her
aright
love
filled
her
heart
ousting
that
other
portentous
heaven
iii
and
then
skale
announced
that
the
time
was
ready
for
rehearsals
let
us
practice
the
chord
he
said
so
that
when
the
moment
comes
suddenly
upon
us
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
in
the
daytime
or
in
the
night
we
shall
be
prepared
and
each
shall
fly
to
his
appointed
place
and
utter
his
appointed
note
the
reasons
for
these
definite
arrangements
he
did
not
pretend
to
explain
for
they
belonged
to
a
part
of
his
discovery
that
he
kept
rigidly
to
himself
and
why
spinrobin
and
miriam
were
to
call
their
notes
from
the
corridor
itself
while
skale
boomed
his
great
bass
in
the
prepared
cellar
mawle
chanting
her
alto
midway
in
the
hall
acting
as
a
connecting
channel
in
some
way
was
apparently
never
made
fully
clear
in
spinrobin
imagination
it
was
very
like
a
practical
illustration
of
the
written
chord
the
notes
rising
from
the
bass
clef
to
the
high
soprano
the
cellar
to
the
attic
so
to
speak
but
whatever
the
meaning
behind
it
skale
was
exceedingly
careful
to
teach
to
each
of
them
his
and
her
appointed
place
when
the
letters
move
of
themselves
and
make
the
first
sign
he
repeated
we
shall
know
it
beyond
all
doubt
or
question
at
any
moment
of
the
day
or
night
it
may
come
each
of
you
then
hasten
to
your
appointed
place
and
wait
for
the
sound
of
my
bass
in
the
cellar
there
will
be
no
mistake
about
it
you
will
hear
it
rising
through
the
building
then
each
in
turn
as
it
reaches
you
lift
your
voices
and
call
your
notes
the
chord
thus
rising
through
the
building
will
gather
in
the
flying
letters
it
will
unite
them
it
will
summon
them
down
to
the
fundamental
i
utter
in
the
cellar
the
moment
the
letter
summoned
by
each
particular
voice
reaches
the
cellar
that
voice
must
cease
its
utterance
thus
one
by
one
the
four
mighty
letters
will
come
to
rest
below
the
gongs
will
vibrate
in
sympathetic
resonance
the
colors
will
tremble
and
respond
the
finely
drawn
wires
will
link
the
two
and
the
lens
of
gas
will
lead
them
to
the
wax
and
the
record
of
the
august
and
terrible
syllable
will
be
completely
chained
at
any
desired
moment
afterwards
i
shall
be
able
to
reawaken
it
its
phonetic
utterance
its
correct
pronunciation
captured
thus
in
the
two
media
of
air
and
ether
sound
and
light
will
be
in
my
safe
possession
ready
for
use
but
and
he
looked
down
upon
his
listeners
with
a
dreadful
and
impressive
gravity
that
yet
only
just
concealed
the
bursting
exultation
the
thought
caused
him
to
feel
remember
that
once
you
have
uttered
your
note
you
will
have
sucked
out
from
the
letter
a
portion
of
its
own
terrific
life
and
force
which
will
immediately
pass
into
yourself
you
will
instantly
absorb
this
for
you
will
have
called
upon
a
mighty
name
the
mightiest
and
your
prayer
will
have
been
answered
he
stooped
and
whispered
as
in
an
act
of
earnest
prayer
shall
be
as
something
of
cold
splendor
terribly
possessing
came
close
to
them
as
he
spoke
the
words
for
this
was
no
empty
phrase
behind
it
lay
the
great
drive
of
a
relentless
reality
and
it
struck
at
the
very
root
of
the
fear
that
grew
every
moment
more
insistent
in
the
hearts
of
the
two
lovers
they
did
not
want
to
become
as
gods
they
desired
to
remain
quietly
human
and
to
but
before
either
of
them
could
utter
speech
even
had
they
dared
the
awful
clergyman
continued
and
nothing
brought
home
to
them
more
vividly
the
horrible
responsibility
of
the
experiment
and
the
results
of
possible
failure
than
the
few
words
with
which
he
concluded
and
to
mispronounce
to
utter
falsely
to
call
inaccurately
will
mean
to
summon
into
life
upon
the
world
and
into
the
heart
of
the
utterer
that
which
is
incomplete
that
which
is
not
god
devils
devils
of
that
subtle
alteration
which
is
destruction
the
devils
of
a
lie
and
so
for
hours
at
a
time
they
rehearsed
the
sounds
of
the
chord
but
very
softly
lest
the
sound
should
rise
and
reach
the
four
rooms
and
invite
the
escape
of
the
waiting
letters
prematurely
mawle
holding
the
bit
of
paper
on
which
her
instructions
were
clearly
written
was
as
eager
almost
as
her
master
and
as
the
note
she
had
to
utter
was
practically
the
only
one
left
in
the
register
of
her
voice
her
deafness
provided
little
difficulty
though
when
the
letters
awake
into
life
and
cry
aloud
said
skale
beaming
upon
her
dear
old
face
it
will
be
in
tones
that
even
the
deaf
shall
hear
for
they
will
spell
a
measure
of
redemption
that
shall
destroy
in
a
second
of
time
all
physical
disabilities
whatsoever
it
was
at
this
moment
spinrobin
asked
a
question
that
for
days
had
been
hovering
about
his
lips
he
asked
it
gravely
hesitatingly
even
solemnly
while
miriam
hung
upon
the
answer
with
an
anxiety
as
great
as
his
own
and
if
any
one
of
us
fails
he
said
and
pronounces
falsely
will
the
result
affect
all
of
us
or
only
the
utterer
the
utterer
only
replied
the
clergyman
for
it
is
his
own
spirit
that
must
absorb
the
forces
and
powers
invoked
by
the
sound
he
utters
he
took
the
question
lightly
it
seemed
the
possibility
of
failure
was
too
remote
to
be
practical
chapter
xiii
i
but
spinrobin
was
hardly
prepared
for
the
suddenness
of
the
denouement
he
had
looked
for
a
longer
period
of
preparation
with
the
paraphernalia
of
a
considerable
even
an
august
ceremony
instead
the
announcement
came
with
an
abrupt
simplicity
that
caught
him
with
a
horrid
shock
of
surprise
he
was
taken
wholly
unawares
the
only
thing
i
fear
skale
had
confided
to
them
is
that
the
vibrations
of
our
chord
may
have
already
risen
to
the
rooms
and
cause
a
premature
escape
but
even
so
we
shall
have
ample
warning
for
the
deaf
being
protected
from
the
coarser
sounds
of
earth
are
swift
to
hear
the
lightest
whispers
from
heaven
mawle
will
know
mawle
will
instantly
warn
us
and
this
apparently
was
what
happened
though
not
precisely
as
skale
had
intended
nor
with
the
margin
for
preparation
he
had
hoped
it
was
all
so
swift
and
brief
and
shattering
that
to
hear
spinrobin
tell
it
makes
one
think
of
a
mass
of
fireworks
that
some
stray
spark
has
sent
with
blazing
explosion
into
the
air
to
the
complete
loss
of
the
calculated
effect
had
they
gone
off
seriatim
as
intended
and
in
the
awful
stress
of
excitement
there
can
be
no
question
that
spinny
acted
out
of
that
subconscious
region
of
the
mind
which
considers
and
weighs
deeds
before
passing
them
on
to
the
surface
mind
translating
them
into
physical
expression
and
thinking
itself
responsible
for
the
whole
operation
the
course
he
adopted
was
thus
instinctive
and
since
he
had
no
time
to
judge
blameless
neither
he
nor
miriam
had
any
idea
really
that
their
minds
subconsciously
were
already
made
up
yet
only
that
morning
he
had
been
talking
with
her
skirting
round
the
subject
as
they
always
did
ashamed
of
his
doubts
about
success
and
trying
to
persuade
her
and
therefore
himself
that
the
path
of
duty
lay
in
following
their
leader
blindly
to
the
very
end
he
had
seen
her
on
the
stairs
ahead
of
him
and
had
overtaken
her
quickly
he
drew
her
down
beside
him
and
they
sat
like
two
children
perched
on
the
steps
it
coming
you
know
he
said
abruptly
the
moment
getting
very
close
he
felt
the
light
shudder
that
passed
through
her
into
himself
she
turned
her
face
to
him
and
he
saw
the
flush
of
excitement
painted
in
the
center
of
the
usually
pale
cheeks
he
thought
of
some
rare
flower
delicately
exotic
that
had
sprung
suddenly
into
blossom
from
the
heart
of
the
bleak
december
day
out
of
the
very
boards
whereon
they
sat
we
shall
then
be
as
gods
he
added
filled
with
the
huge
power
of
those
terrific
letters
and
that
is
only
the
beginning
in
himself
he
was
striving
to
coax
a
fading
enthusiasm
and
to
pour
it
into
her
her
little
hand
stole
into
his
we
shall
be
a
sort
of
angel
together
i
suppose
just
think
of
it
his
voice
was
not
as
thrilling
as
it
ought
to
have
been
for
very
human
notes
vibrated
down
below
in
the
part
he
tried
to
keep
back
he
saw
the
flush
fade
from
her
cheeks
and
the
pallor
spread
you
and
i
miriam
something
tremendous
together
greater
than
any
other
man
and
woman
in
the
whole
world
think
of
it
dear
baby
just
think
of
it
a
tiny
frown
gathered
upon
her
forehead
darkening
the
grey
eyes
with
shadows
but
lose
our
winky
she
said
nestling
against
his
coat
her
voice
singularly
soft
her
fingers
scratching
gently
the
palm
of
his
hand
where
they
lay
hush
hush
he
answered
kissing
her
into
silence
we
must
have
more
faith
i
think
everything
will
be
all
right
and
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
lose
our
winky
he
added
very
tenderly
smothering
the
doubt
as
best
he
could
although
we
may
find
his
name
changed
like
the
rest
of
us
he
will
get
a
name
i
suppose
then
he
wo
be
winky
any
longer
she
objected
with
a
touch
of
obstinacy
that
was
very
seductive
we
shall
all
be
different
perhaps
we
shall
be
too
wonderful
to
need
each
other
any
more
oh
spinny
you
precious
thing
my
life
needs
think
of
that
we
may
be
too
wonderful
even
to
care
spinrobin
turned
and
faced
her
he
tried
to
speak
with
authority
and
conviction
but
he
was
a
bad
actor
always
he
met
her
soft
grey
eyes
already
moist
and
shining
with
a
tenderness
of
love
beyond
belief
and
gazed
into
them
with
what
degree
of
sternness
he
could
miriam
he
said
solemnly
is
it
possible
that
you
do
not
want
us
to
be
as
gods
her
answer
came
this
time
without
hesitation
his
pretended
severity
only
made
her
happy
for
nothing
could
intimidate
by
a
hair
breadth
this
exquisite
first
love
of
her
awakening
soul
some
day
perhaps
oh
my
sweet
master
she
whispered
with
trembling
lips
but
not
now
i
want
to
be
on
earth
first
with
you
and
with
our
winky
to
hear
that
precious
little
voice
call
him
sweet
master
was
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
he
made
an
effort
however
to
insist
upon
this
fancied
idea
of
duty
to
skale
though
everything
of
course
betrayed
him
eyes
voice
gestures
but
we
owe
it
to
skale
to
become
as
gods
he
faltered
trying
to
make
the
volume
of
his
voice
atone
for
its
lack
of
conviction
and
it
was
then
she
uttered
the
simple
phrase
that
utterly
confounded
him
and
showed
him
the
new
heaven
and
new
earth
wherein
he
and
she
and
winky
already
lived
i
am
as
god
she
said
simply
the
whole
passion
of
a
clean
strong
little
soul
behind
the
words
you
have
made
me
so
you
love
me
ii
the
same
moment
before
they
could
speak
or
act
skale
was
upon
them
from
behind
with
a
roar
practicing
your
splendid
notes
together
he
cried
thundering
down
the
steps
past
them
three
at
a
time
clothed
for
the
first
time
in
the
flowing
scarlet
robe
he
usually
wore
only
in
the
particular
room
where
his
own
note
lived
that
capital
sing
it
together
in
your
hearts
and
in
your
souls
and
in
your
minds
and
the
more
the
better
he
swept
by
them
like
a
storm
vanishing
through
the
hall
below
like
some
living
flame
of
fire
they
both
understood
that
he
wore
that
robe
for
protection
and
that
throughout
the
house
the
heralds
of
the
approaching
powers
of
the
imprisoned
letters
were
therefore
already
astir
his
steps
echoed
below
them
in
the
depths
of
the
building
as
he
descended
to
the
cellar
intent
upon
some
detail
of
the
appalling
consummation
that
drew
every
minute
nearer
they
turned
and
faced
one
another
breathless
a
little
tenderness
and
terror
shone
plainly
in
their
eyes
but
spinrobin
ever
an
ineffectual
little
man
and
with
nothing
of
the
master
really
in
his
composition
anywhere
found
no
word
to
speak
that
sudden
irruption
of
the
terrific
clergyman
into
their
intimate
world
had
come
with
an
effect
of
dramatic
and
incalculable
authority
like
a
blast
of
air
that
drives
the
furnace
to
new
heat
and
turns
the
metal
white
his
mind
now
suddenly
saw
clear
and
sure
the
effect
of
the
incident
was
too
explosive
however
for
him
to
find
expression
action
he
found
in
a
measure
but
no
words
he
took
miriam
passionately
into
his
arms
as
they
stood
there
in
the
gathering
dusk
upon
the
staircase
of
that
haunted
and
terrible
building
and
miriam
it
was
who
found
the
words
upon
which
they
separated
and
went
quietly
away
to
the
solitude
each
needed
for
the
soul
we
leave
the
gods
alone
she
said
with
gentle
decision
yet
making
it
seem
as
though
she
appealed
to
his
greater
strength
and
wisdom
to
decide
i
want
nothing
but
you
you
and
winky
and
all
you
really
want
is
me
but
in
his
room
he
heard
the
vibrations
of
the
clergyman
voice
rising
up
through
the
floor
and
walls
as
he
practiced
in
the
cellar
the
sounds
with
which
the
ancient
hebrews
concealed
the
tetragrammaton
yod
he
vau
he
jehovah
jahve
of
which
the
approaching
great
experiment
however
concerned
itself
only
with
the
opening
vibrations
of
the
first
letter
yod
and
as
he
listened
he
hesitated
again
wondering
after
all
whether
miriam
was
right
iii
it
was
towards
the
end
of
their
short
silent
dinner
that
very
night
the
silence
due
to
the
fact
that
everybody
was
intently
listening
when
spinrobin
caught
the
whisper
of
a
singular
faint
sound
that
he
took
first
to
be
the
rising
of
wind
the
wind
sometimes
came
down
that
way
with
curious
gulps
from
the
terraces
of
the
surrounding
moors
yet
in
this
sound
was
none
of
that
rush
and
sigh
that
the
hills
breed
it
did
not
drop
across
the
curves
of
the
world
it
rose
from
the
center
he
looked
up
sharply
then
at
once
realized
that
the
sound
was
not
outside
at
all
but
inside
inside
the
very
room
where
he
sat
facing
skale
and
miriam
then
something
in
his
soul
recognized
it
it
was
the
first
wave
in
an
immense
vibration
something
stretched
within
him
as
foam
stretches
on
the
elastic
side
of
a
heaped
atlantic
roller
retreated
then
came
on
again
with
a
second
gigantic
crest
the
rhythm
of
the
huge
sound
had
caught
him
the
life
in
him
expanded
awfully
rose
to
far
summits
dropped
to
utter
depths
a
sense
of
glowing
exaltation
swept
through
him
as
though
wings
of
power
lifted
his
heart
with
enormous
ascendancy
the
biggest
passions
of
his
soul
stirred
the
sweetest
dreams
yearnings
aspirations
he
had
ever
known
were
blown
to
fever
heat
above
all
his
passion
for
miriam
waxed
tumultuous
and
possessed
him
skale
dropped
his
fruit
knife
and
uttered
a
cry
but
a
cry
of
so
peculiar
a
character
that
spinrobin
thought
for
a
moment
he
was
about
to
burst
into
song
at
the
same
instant
he
stood
up
and
his
chair
fell
backwards
with
a
crash
upon
the
floor
spinrobin
stood
up
too
he
asserts
always
that
he
was
lifted
up
he
recognized
no
conscious
effort
of
his
own
it
was
at
this
point
moreover
that
miriam
pale
as
linen
yet
uttering
no
sound
and
fully
mistress
of
herself
left
her
side
of
the
table
and
ran
round
swiftly
to
the
protection
of
her
lover
she
came
close
up
spinny
she
said
it
come
thus
all
three
were
standing
round
that
dinner
table
on
the
verge
of
some
very
vigorous
action
not
yet
disclosed
as
people
vigilant
and
alert
stand
up
at
a
cry
of
fire
when
the
door
from
the
passage
opened
noisily
and
in
rushed
mawle
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
of
light
such
as
might
come
from
a
furnace
door
suddenly
thrown
wide
in
some
dark
foundry
only
the
light
was
not
steady
it
was
whirling
she
ran
across
the
floor
as
though
dancing
the
dancing
of
a
child
propelled
it
seemed
by
an
irresistible
drive
of
force
behind
while
with
her
through
the
opened
door
came
a
roaring
volume
of
sound
that
was
terrible
as
niagara
let
loose
yet
at
the
same
time
exquisitely
sweet
as
birds
or
children
singing
upon
these
two
incongruous
qualities
spinrobin
always
insists
the
deaf
shall
hear
came
sharply
from
the
clergyman
lips
the
sentence
uncompleted
for
the
housekeeper
cut
him
short
they
out
she
cried
with
a
loud
jubilance
skale
prisoners
are
bursting
their
way
about
the
house
and
one
of
them
she
added
with
a
scream
of
joy
and
terror
mingled
is
in
my
throat
if
the
odd
phrase
she
made
use
of
stuck
vividly
in
spinrobin
memory
the
appearance
she
presented
impressed
him
even
more
for
her
face
was
shining
and
alight
radiant
as
when
skale
had
called
her
true
name
weeks
before
flashes
of
beauty
ran
about
the
eyes
and
mouth
and
she
looked
eighteen
eternally
eighteen
with
a
youth
that
was
permanent
and
unchanging
moreover
not
only
was
hearing
restored
to
her
but
her
left
arm
withered
for
years
was
in
the
act
of
pointing
to
the
ceiling
instinct
with
vigorous
muscular
life
her
whole
presentment
was
splendid
intense
redeemed
the
deaf
hear
repeated
skale
in
a
shout
and
was
across
the
room
with
the
impetus
of
a
released
projectile
the
letters
are
out
and
alive
to
your
appointed
places
the
syllable
has
caught
us
quick
quick
if
you
love
your
soul
and
truth
fly
deafening
thunders
rushed
and
crashed
and
blew
about
the
room
interpenetrated
everywhere
at
the
same
time
by
that
searching
strain
of
sweetness
spinrobin
had
first
noticed
the
sense
of
life
running
free
and
abundant
was
very
remarkable
the
same
moment
he
found
his
hand
clasped
and
felt
himself
torn
along
by
the
side
of
the
rushing
clergyman
into
the
hall
behind
them
danced
mawle
her
cap
awry
her
apron
flying
her
boots
taking
the
light
dancing
step
of
youth
with
quick
gliding
tread
miriam
still
silent
was
at
his
heels
he
remembers
her
delicate
strange
perfume
reaching
him
faintly
through
all
the
incredible
turmoil
of
that
impetuous
exit
in
the
hall
the
roar
increased
terrifically
about
his
ears
skale
in
his
biggest
booming
voice
was
uttering
the
names
of
hebrew
angels
invoking
forces
that
is
to
his
help
and
behind
him
mawle
was
singing
singing
fragments
apparently
of
the
note
she
had
to
utter
as
well
as
fragments
of
her
own
true
name
thus
magically
recovered
her
restored
arm
gyrated
furiously
her
tripping
youth
spelt
witchery
yet
the
whole
madness
of
the
scene
came
to
spinrobin
with
a
freezing
wind
of
terror
for
about
it
was
a
lawless
audacious
blasphemy
that
must
surely
win
for
itself
a
quite
appalling
punishment
yet
nothing
happened
at
once
nothing
destructive
at
least
skale
and
the
housekeeper
he
saw
were
hurriedly
robing
themselves
in
the
red
and
yellow
surplices
that
hung
from
nails
in
the
hall
and
the
instinct
to
laugh
at
the
sight
was
utterly
overwhelmed
when
he
remembered
that
these
were
the
colors
which
were
used
for
safety
in
their
respective
rooms
it
was
a
scene
of
wild
confusion
and
bewilderment
which
the
memory
refuses
to
reproduce
coherently
in
his
own
throat
already
began
a
passionate
rising
of
sound
that
he
knew
was
the
note
he
had
to
utter
attempting
to
escape
summoned
forth
automatically
by
these
terrible
vibrating
letters
in
the
air
a
cataract
of
sound
seemed
to
fill
the
building
and
made
it
shake
to
its
very
foundations
but
the
hall
he
saw
was
not
only
alive
with
music
it
was
ablaze
with
light
a
white
and
brilliant
glory
that
at
first
dazzled
him
to
the
point
of
temporary
blindness
the
same
second
skale
voice
storming
its
way
somehow
above
the
tumult
made
itself
heard
to
the
rooms
upstairs
spinrobin
to
the
corridor
with
miriam
and
when
you
hear
my
voice
from
the
cellar
we
may
yet
be
in
time
to
unite
the
letters
he
released
the
secretary
hand
flinging
it
from
him
and
was
off
with
a
bounding
leaping
motion
like
an
escaped
animal
towards
the
stone
passage
that
led
to
the
cellar
steps
and
spinrobin
turning
about
himself
like
a
top
in
a
perfect
frenzy
of
bewilderment
heard
his
great
voice
as
he
disappeared
round
the
corner
it
has
come
upon
me
like
a
thief
in
the
night
before
i
am
fully
prepared
it
has
called
me
may
the
powers
of
the
name
have
mercy
upon
my
soul
and
he
was
gone
for
the
last
time
had
spinrobin
set
his
eyes
upon
the
towering
earthly
form
of
the
rev
philip
skale
iv
then
at
first
it
seems
the
old
enthusiasm
caught
him
and
with
him
therefore
caught
miriam
too
that
savage
and
dominant
curiosity
to
know
clutched
him
overpowering
even
the
assaults
of
a
terror
that
fairly
battered
him
through
all
the
chaos
and
welter
of
his
dazed
mind
he
sought
feverishly
for
the
note
he
had
to
utter
yet
found
it
not
for
he
was
too
horribly
confused
fiddles
colored
robes
gongs
giant
walls
and
jostled
one
another
in
his
memory
with
a
jumble
of
disproportion
quite
inextricable
next
impelled
by
that
driving
sense
of
duty
to
skale
he
turned
to
the
girl
at
his
side
can
you
do
it
he
cried
unable
to
make
her
voice
heard
above
the
clamor
she
nodded
quickly
in
acquiescence
spinrobin
noticed
that
her
little
mouth
was
set
rather
firmly
though
there
was
a
radiance
about
her
eyes
and
features
that
made
her
sweetly
beautiful
he
remembers
that
her
loveliness
and
her
pluck
uplifted
him
above
all
former
littlenesses
of
hesitation
and
seizing
her
outstretched
hand
they
flew
up
the
main
staircase
and
in
less
than
a
minute
reached
the
opening
of
the
long
corridor
where
the
rooms
were
here
however
they
stopped
with
a
gasp
for
a
hurricane
of
moving
air
met
them
in
the
face
like
the
draught
from
some
immense
furnace
again
the
crest
of
a
wave
in
the
colossal
had
caught
them
staggering
against
the
wall
they
tried
again
and
again
to
face
the
tempest
of
sound
and
light
but
the
space
beyond
them
was
lit
with
the
same
unearthly
brilliance
as
the
hall
and
out
of
the
whole
long
throat
of
that
haunted
corridor
issued
such
a
passion
of
music
and
such
a
torrent
of
gorgeous
color
that
it
seemed
impossible
for
any
aggregation
of
physical
particles
least
of
all
poor
human
bodies
to
remain
coherent
for
a
single
instant
before
the
concentrated
onslaught
yet
game
to
the
inmost
core
of
his
little
personality
and
raised
far
above
his
normal
powers
by
the
evidence
of
miriam
courage
and
fidelity
he
struggled
with
all
his
might
and
searched
through
the
chambers
of
his
being
for
the
note
he
was
ordained
to
utter
in
the
chord
the
ignominy
of
failure
now
that
the
great
experiment
was
full
upon
him
failure
in
miriam
eyes
too
was
simply
impossible
to
contemplate
yet
in
spite
of
every
effort
the
memory
of
that
note
escaped
him
utterly
for
the
forces
of
his
soul
floundered
helpless
and
disheveled
before
the
too
mighty
splendors
that
were
upon
him
at
such
close
quarters
the
sounds
he
actually
succeeded
in
emitting
between
dry
and
quivering
lips
were
pitiful
and
feeble
beyond
words
down
that
living
corridor
meanwhile
he
saw
the
doors
of
the
four
rooms
were
gone
consumed
like
tissue
paper
and
through
the
narrow
portals
there
shouldered
forward
bathed
in
light
ineffable
the
separate
outlines
of
the
letters
so
long
imprisoned
in
inactivity
and
with
their
appearance
the
sounds
instantly
ceased
having
overpassed
the
limits
of
what
is
audible
to
human
ears
a
great
stillness
dropped
about
them
with
an
abrupt
crash
of
utter
silence
for
a
crash
of
silence
it
was
and
then
from
the
categories
of
the
incomprehensible
and
unmanifest
something
loomed
forth
towards
them
where
limp
and
shaking
they
leaned
against
the
wall
and
they
witnessed
the
indescribable
operation
by
which
the
four
letters
whirling
and
alive
ran
together
and
melted
into
a
single
terrific
semblance
of
a
form
the
sight
of
which
entered
the
heart
of
spinrobin
and
threatened
to
split
it
asunder
with
the
joy
of
the
most
sublime
terror
and
adoration
a
human
soul
has
ever
known
and
the
whole
gigantic
glory
of
skale
purpose
came
upon
him
like
a
tempest
the
magnificent
effrontery
by
which
the
man
sought
to
storm
his
way
to
heaven
again
laid
its
spell
upon
him
the
reaction
was
of
amazing
swiftness
it
almost
seemed
as
though
time
ceased
to
operate
so
instantaneously
did
his
mood
pass
from
terror
to
elation
wild
ecstatic
elation
that
could
dare
anything
and
everything
to
share
in
the
awful
delight
and
wonder
of
skale
transcendent
experiment
and
so
forgetting
himself
and
his
little
disabilities
of
terror
and
shrinking
he
sought
once
again
for
the
note
he
was
to
utter
in
the
chord
and
this
time
he
found
it
v
very
faintly
yet
distinctly
audible
in
the
deep
stillness
it
sounded
far
away
down
in
the
deeps
of
his
being
and
with
a
splendid
spiritual
exultation
tearing
and
swelling
in
his
heart
he
turned
at
once
triumphantly
to
miriam
beside
him
utter
your
note
too
he
cried
utter
it
with
mine
for
any
moment
now
we
shall
hear
the
command
from
the
cellar
be
ready
and
the
form
meanwhile
limned
in
the
wonder
of
an
undecipherable
or
at
least
untranslatable
geometry
silently
roaring
enthroned
in
the
undiscoverable
colors
beyond
the
spectrum
swept
towards
them
as
he
spoke
at
the
same
instant
miriam
answered
him
her
exquisite
little
face
set
like
a
rock
her
marble
pallor
painted
with
the
glory
of
the
approaching
splendors
just
when
the
moment
of
success
was
upon
them
when
the
flying
letters
were
abroad
when
all
the
difficult
weeks
of
preparation
were
face
to
face
with
the
consummation
and
when
any
moment
booming
bass
might
rise
from
the
bowels
of
the
building
as
the
signal
to
utter
the
great
chord
and
unite
the
fragments
of
the
first
divine
syllable
when
spinrobin
had
at
last
conquered
his
weakness
and
recovered
his
note
then
at
this
decisive
and
supreme
moment
miriam
asserted
herself
and
took
the
reins
of
command
no
she
said
looking
with
sudden
authority
straight
into
his
eyes
no
i
will
not
utter
the
note
nor
shall
you
utter
yours
and
she
clapped
her
little
hand
tight
upon
his
mouth
in
that
instant
of
unutterable
surprise
the
two
great
forces
of
his
life
and
personality
met
together
with
an
explosive
violence
wholly
beyond
his
power
to
control
for
on
the
one
hand
lay
the
fierce
enticement
of
skale
heaven
with
all
that
it
portended
and
on
the
other
the
deep
though
temporarily
submerged
human
passion
of
his
love
for
the
girl
miriam
sudden
action
revealed
the
truth
to
him
better
than
any
argument
in
a
flash
he
realized
that
her
choice
was
made
and
that
she
was
in
entire
and
final
revolt
against
the
whole
elaborate
experiment
and
all
that
it
involved
the
risk
of
losing
her
spinny
or
finding
him
changed
in
some
condition
of
redemption
where
he
would
no
longer
be
the
little
human
thing
she
so
dearly
loved
had
helped
her
to
this
final
swift
conclusion
with
her
hand
tight
over
his
lips
and
her
face
of
white
decision
before
him
he
understood
she
called
him
with
those
big
grey
eyes
to
the
sweet
and
common
uses
of
life
instead
of
to
the
heights
of
some
audacious
heaven
where
they
might
be
as
gods
with
philip
skale
she
clung
to
humanity
and
spinrobin
seeing
her
at
last
with
spiritual
eyes
fully
opened
knew
finally
that
she
was
right
but
oh
he
always
cries
in
that
moment
i
knew
the
most
terrible
choice
i
have
ever
had
to
make
for
it
was
not
a
choice
between
life
and
death
but
a
choice
between
two
lives
each
of
infinite
promised
wonder
and
what
do
you
think
it
was
that
decided
me
and
made
me
choose
the
wholesome
humble
life
with
little
miriam
in
preference
to
the
grandeur
of
skale
vast
dream
what
you
think
and
his
face
always
turns
pink
and
then
as
he
asks
it
hesitating
absurdly
before
giving
the
answer
i
tell
you
because
you
never
guess
in
this
world
and
then
he
lowers
his
voice
and
says
it
was
the
delicious
little
sweet
perfume
of
her
fingers
as
she
held
them
over
my
lips
that
delicate
faint
smell
was
the
symbol
of
human
happiness
and
through
all
the
whirlwind
of
sound
and
color
about
him
it
somehow
managed
to
convey
its
poignant
searching
message
of
the
girl
utter
love
straight
into
his
heart
thus
curiously
out
of
proportion
and
insignificant
indeed
are
sometimes
the
decisive
details
that
in
moments
of
overwhelming
experience
turn
the
course
of
life
river
this
way
or
that
with
a
single
wild
cry
in
his
soul
that
found
no
audible
expression
he
gave
up
the
unequal
struggle
he
turned
and
with
miriam
by
his
side
flew
down
the
corridor
from
the
advent
of
the
immensity
that
was
upon
them
from
the
approach
of
the
escaping
letters
vi
how
spinrobin
found
his
way
out
of
that
house
remains
an
unsolved
mystery
he
never
understood
it
himself
he
remembers
only
that
when
they
reached
the
ground
floor
the
vibrations
of
skale
opening
bass
note
had
already
begun
its
effect
too
was
immediately
noticeable
for
the
roar
of
the
escaping
letters
which
upstairs
had
reached
so
immense
a
volume
as
to
be
recognized
only
in
terms
of
silence
now
suddenly
grew
in
a
measure
harnessed
and
restrained
their
vibration
became
reduced
down
closer
to
the
wavelength
which
is
the
limit
of
human
audition
they
were
being
leashed
in
by
the
summoning
they
grew
once
more
audible
on
the
rising
swirl
of
sound
the
two
humans
were
swept
down
passages
and
across
halls
as
two
leaves
are
borne
by
a
tempest
and
after
frantic
efforts
in
which
spinrobin
bruised
his
body
against
doors
and
walls
without
number
he
found
himself
at
last
in
the
open
air
and
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
house
of
terror
stars
shone
overhead
he
saw
the
outline
of
hills
breaths
of
cool
wind
fanned
his
burning
skin
and
eyes
but
he
dared
not
turn
to
look
or
listen
the
music
of
that
opening
note
now
rising
through
the
building
from
the
cellar
might
catch
him
and
win
him
back
the
chord
in
which
himself
and
miriam
were
to
have
uttered
their
appointed
tones
even
was
still
mighty
to
overwhelm
its
effect
upon
the
letters
themselves
had
been
immediate
the
feeling
that
he
had
proved
faithless
to
skale
unworthy
of
the
great
experiment
never
properly
attuned
to
this
fearful
music
of
the
gods
this
was
forgotten
in
the
overmastering
desire
to
escape
from
it
all
into
the
safety
of
common
human
things
with
miriam
setting
his
course
ever
up
the
hills
he
ran
on
and
on
till
breath
failed
him
utterly
and
he
was
obliged
to
stop
for
lack
of
strength
and
it
was
only
then
he
realized
that
the
whole
time
the
girl
had
been
in
his
arms
he
had
been
carrying
her
placing
her
on
the
ground
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
eyes
in
the
darkness
and
saw
that
they
were
still
charged
with
the
one
devouring
passion
that
had
made
the
sacrifice
of
skale
and
of
all
her
training
since
birth
inevitable
soft
and
glowing
with
her
first
knowledge
of
love
her
grey
eyes
shone
like
stars
newly
risen
come
come
he
whispered
hoarsely
we
must
get
as
far
as
possible
away
from
it
all
across
the
hills
we
shall
find
safety
once
the
splendors
overtake
us
we
are
lost
seizing
her
by
the
hand
they
pressed
on
again
the
ocean
of
sound
rising
and
thundering
behind
them
and
below
without
knowing
it
he
had
taken
the
path
by
which
the
clergyman
had
brought
him
from
the
station
weeks
ago
on
the
day
of
his
first
arrival
with
a
confused
memory
as
of
a
dream
he
recognized
it
the
ground
was
slippery
with
dead
leaves
whose
odor
penetrated
sharply
the
air
of
night
everywhere
about
him
as
they
paused
from
time
to
time
in
the
little
open
spaces
the
trees
pressed
up
thickly
and
ever
from
the
valley
they
had
just
left
the
increasing
tide
of
sound
came
pouring
up
after
them
like
the
roar
of
the
sea
escaping
through
doors
upon
the
surface
of
the
world
and
even
now
the
marvelous
enticing
wonder
of
it
caught
him
more
than
once
and
made
him
hesitate
the
sense
of
what
he
was
giving
up
sickened
him
with
a
great
sudden
yearning
of
regret
the
mightiness
of
that
loved
leader
lonely
and
unafraid
trafficking
with
the
principalities
and
powers
of
sound
and
reckoning
without
misgiving
upon
the
cooperation
of
his
other
notes
this
plucked
fearfully
at
his
heartstrings
but
only
in
great
tearing
gusts
so
to
speak
which
passed
the
instant
he
realized
the
little
breathless
girl
at
his
side
charged
with
her
beautiful
love
for
him
and
the
wholesome
ambition
for
human
things
oh
but
the
heaven
we
losing
he
cried
once
aloud
unable
to
contain
himself
oh
miriam
and
i
have
proved
unworthy
small
small
enough
to
stay
with
me
forever
and
ever
here
on
the
earth
she
replied
passionately
seizing
his
hand
and
drawing
him
further
up
the
hill
then
she
stopped
suddenly
and
gathered
a
handful
of
dead
leaves
moss
twigs
and
earth
the
exquisite
familiar
perfume
as
she
held
it
to
his
face
pierced
through
him
with
a
singular
power
of
conviction
we
should
lose
she
exclaimed
there
none
of
this
in
heaven
the
earth
the
earth
the
dear
beautiful
earth
with
you
and
winky
is
what
i
want
and
when
he
stopped
her
outburst
with
a
kiss
fully
understanding
the
profound
truth
she
so
quaintly
expressed
he
smelt
the
trees
and
mountains
in
her
hair
and
her
fragrance
was
mingled
there
with
the
fragrance
of
that
old
earth
on
which
they
stood
vii
the
rising
flood
of
sound
sent
them
charging
ahead
the
same
minute
for
it
seemed
upon
them
with
a
rush
and
it
was
only
after
much
stumbling
and
floundering
among
trees
and
boulders
that
they
emerged
into
the
open
space
of
the
hills
beyond
the
woods
actually
perhaps
they
had
been
running
for
twenty
minutes
but
to
them
it
seemed
that
they
had
been
running
for
days
they
stood
still
and
looked
about
them
you
shall
never
regret
never
never
miriam
whispered
quickly
i
can
make
you
happier
than
all
this
ever
could
and
she
waved
her
arm
towards
the
house
below
and
you
know
it
my
little
master
but
before
he
could
reply
or
do
more
than
place
an
arm
about
her
waist
to
support
her
something
came
to
pass
that
communicated
its
message
to
their
souls
with
an
incalculable
certainty
neither
could
explain
perhaps
it
was
that
distance
enabled
them
to
distinguish
between
the
sounds
more
clearly
or
perhaps
their
beings
were
still
so
intimately
connected
with
skale
that
some
psychic
warning
traveled
up
to
them
across
the
night
but
at
any
rate
there
then
came
about
this
sharp
and
sudden
change
in
the
quality
of
the
round
them
that
proclaimed
the
arrival
of
an
exceedingly
dramatic
moment
the
nature
of
the
rushing
flying
vibrations
underwent
alteration
and
looking
one
another
in
the
eyes
they
realized
what
it
meant
he
beginning
faltered
spinrobin
in
some
skeleton
of
a
voice
skale
has
begun
to
he
said
it
beneath
his
breath
down
in
the
cellar
of
that
awful
house
the
giant
clergyman
alone
and
undismayed
had
begun
to
call
the
opening
vibration
of
the
living
chord
which
was
to
gather
in
this
torrent
of
escaping
letters
and
unite
them
in
temporary
safety
in
the
crypts
of
the
prepared
vault
for
the
first
time
in
eighteen
hundred
years
the
initial
sound
of
the
name
that
rusheth
through
the
universe
the
first
sound
of
its
opening
syllable
that
is
was
about
to
thunder
its
incalculable
message
over
the
earth
crouching
close
against
each
other
they
stood
there
on
the
edge
of
the
woods
the
night
darkly
smothering
about
them
the
bare
open
hills
lying
beyond
in
the
still
sky
waiting
for
the
climax
the
utterance
of
the
first
great
syllable
it
will
make
him
as
god
crashed
the
thought
through
brain
as
he
experienced
the
pangs
of
the
fiercest
remorse
he
had
ever
known
even
without
our
two
notes
the
power
will
be
sublime
but
through
miriam
heart
as
she
pressed
closer
and
closer
i
know
your
true
name
and
you
are
mine
what
else
in
heaven
or
earth
can
ever
matter
chapter
xiv
i
skale
had
indeed
begun
to
utter
and
to
these
two
bewildered
children
standing
there
alone
with
their
love
upon
the
mountain
it
seemed
that
the
whole
world
knew
those
desolate
hills
that
rolled
away
like
waves
beneath
the
stars
the
whispering
woods
about
them
the
distant
sea
eternally
singing
its
own
note
of
sadness
the
boulders
at
their
feet
the
very
stars
themselves
listening
in
the
heart
of
night
one
and
all
were
somehow
aware
that
a
portion
of
the
great
name
which
first
called
them
into
being
was
about
to
issue
from
the
sleep
of
ages
once
again
into
manifestation
to
quicken
them
into
vaster
life
perhaps
to
change
their
forms
perhaps
to
merge
them
all
back
into
the
depths
of
the
original
word
of
creation
with
the
roar
of
a
dissolving
universe
through
everything
from
the
heart
of
the
hidden
primroses
below
the
soil
to
the
center
of
the
huge
moors
above
there
ran
some
swift
thrill
of
life
as
the
sounds
of
which
they
were
the
visible
expression
trembled
in
sympathetic
resonance
with
the
opening
vibrations
of
the
great
syllable
philip
skale
had
begun
to
utter
alone
in
the
cellar
of
that
house
already
aware
probably
that
the
upper
notes
of
his
chord
had
failed
him
he
was
at
last
in
the
act
of
calling
upon
the
name
that
rusheth
through
the
universe
the
syllable
whose
powers
should
pass
into
his
own
being
and
make
him
as
the
gods
and
first
of
all
to
the
infinite
surprise
of
these
two
listening
shaking
lovers
the
roaring
thunders
that
had
been
battling
all
about
them
grew
faint
and
small
and
then
dropped
away
into
mere
trickles
of
sound
retreating
swiftly
down
into
the
dark
valley
where
the
house
stood
as
though
immense
and
invisible
leashes
drew
them
irresistibly
back
one
by
one
the
letters
fled
away
leaving
only
a
murmur
of
incredibly
sweet
echoes
behind
them
in
the
hills
as
the
spoken
by
this
fearless
and
audacious
man
gathered
them
into
their
appointed
places
in
the
cellar
but
if
they
expected
stupendous
things
to
follow
they
were
at
first
singularly
disappointed
for
instead
of
woe
and
terror
instead
of
the
foundering
of
the
visible
universe
there
fell
about
the
listening
world
a
cloak
of
the
most
profound
silence
they
had
ever
known
soft
beyond
conception
the
name
was
not
in
the
whirlwind
out
of
the
heart
of
that
deathly
stillness
it
came
a
small
sweet
voice
that
was
undeniably
the
voice
of
philip
skale
its
awful
thunders
all
smoothed
away
with
it
too
like
a
faint
overtone
came
the
yet
gentler
music
of
another
voice
the
bass
and
alto
were
uttering
their
appointed
notes
in
harmony
and
without
dismay
everywhere
the
sound
rose
up
through
the
darkness
of
great
distance
yet
at
the
same
time
ran
most
penetratingly
sweet
close
beside
them
in
their
very
ears
so
magically
intimate
indeed
was
it
yet
so
potentially
huge
for
all
its
soft
beginning
that
spinrobin
declares
that
what
he
heard
was
probably
not
the
actual
voices
but
only
some
high
liberated
harmonics
of
them
the
sounds
moreover
were
not
distinguishable
as
consonants
and
vowels
in
the
ordinary
sense
and
to
this
day
remain
for
him
beyond
all
reach
of
possible
reproduction
he
did
not
hear
them
as
word
or
syllable
but
as
some
incalculably
splendid
message
that
was
too
mighty
to
be
taken
in
yet
at
the
same
time
was
sweeter
than
all
imagined
music
simple
as
a
little
melody
sweetly
sung
in
tune
artless
as
wind
through
rustling
branches
and
moreover
as
this
small
sweet
voice
ran
singing
everywhere
about
them
in
the
darkness
of
hills
and
woods
spinrobin
realized
with
a
whole
revolution
of
wonder
sweeping
through
him
that
the
sound
for
all
its
gentleness
was
at
work
vehemently
upon
the
surface
of
the
landscape
altering
and
shifting
the
pattern
of
the
solid
earth
just
as
the
sand
had
wreathed
into
outlines
at
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
weeks
ago
and
as
the
form
of
the
clergyman
had
changed
at
the
vibrations
of
the
test
night
the
first
letters
of
the
opening
syllable
of
this
divine
and
magical
name
were
passing
over
the
world
shifting
the
myriad
molecules
that
composed
it
by
the
stress
and
stir
of
its
vast
harmonics
changing
the
pattern
but
this
time
the
change
was
not
dreadful
the
new
outline
even
before
he
actually
perceived
it
was
beautiful
above
all
known
forms
of
beauty
the
outer
semblance
of
the
old
earth
appeared
to
melt
away
and
reveal
that
heart
of
clean
and
dazzling
wonder
which
burns
ever
at
its
inmost
core
the
naked
spirit
divined
by
poets
and
mystics
since
the
beginning
of
time
it
was
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
that
pulsed
below
them
in
response
to
the
majesty
of
this
small
sweet
voice
all
nature
knew
from
the
birds
that
started
out
of
sleep
into
passionate
singing
to
the
fish
that
stirred
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
the
wild
deer
that
sprang
alert
in
their
wintry
coverts
scenting
an
eternal
spring
for
the
earth
rolled
up
as
a
scroll
shaking
the
outworn
skin
of
centuries
from
her
face
and
suffering
all
her
rocky
structure
to
drop
away
and
disclose
the
soft
and
glowing
loveliness
of
an
actual
being
a
being
most
tenderly
and
exquisitely
alive
it
was
the
beginning
of
spiritual
vision
in
their
own
hearts
the
name
had
set
them
free
the
blind
saw
a
part
of
god
ii
and
then
in
spinrobin
heart
the
realization
of
failure
that
he
was
not
in
his
appointed
place
following
his
great
leader
to
the
stars
clashed
together
with
the
splendor
of
his
deep
and
simple
love
for
this
trembling
slip
of
a
girl
beside
him
the
thought
that
god
as
it
were
had
called
him
and
he
had
been
afraid
to
run
and
answer
to
his
name
overpowered
his
timid
aching
soul
with
such
a
flood
of
emotion
that
he
found
himself
struggling
with
a
glorious
temptation
to
tear
down
the
mountainside
again
to
the
house
and
play
his
appointed
part
utter
his
note
in
the
chord
even
thus
late
for
the
essential
bitterness
and
pain
that
lies
at
the
heart
of
all
transitory
earthly
things
the
gnawing
sense
of
incompleteness
and
vanity
that
touches
the
section
of
transitory
existence
men
call
life
met
face
to
face
with
this
passing
glimpse
of
reality
timeless
and
unconditioned
which
the
sound
of
the
splendid
name
flashed
so
terrifically
before
his
awakened
and
threatened
to
overwhelm
him
in
another
instant
he
would
have
yielded
and
gone
forgotten
even
miriam
and
all
the
promised
sweetness
of
life
with
her
when
something
came
to
pass
abruptly
that
threw
his
will
and
all
his
little
calculations
into
a
dark
chaos
of
amazement
where
by
a
kind
of
electrically
swift
reaction
he
realized
that
the
one
true
possible
and
right
thing
for
him
was
this
very
love
he
was
about
to
cast
aside
his
highest
destiny
was
upon
the
unchanged
old
earth
with
miriam
and
winky
she
turned
and
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
in
a
passion
of
tears
as
though
she
had
divined
his
unspoken
temptation
and
at
the
same
time
this
awful
new
thing
was
upon
them
both
it
caught
them
like
a
tempest
for
a
disharmony
a
discord
a
lying
sound
was
loose
upon
the
air
from
those
two
voices
far
below
call
me
by
my
true
name
she
cried
quickly
in
an
anguish
of
terror
for
my
soul
is
afraid
oh
love
me
most
utterly
utterly
utterly
and
save
me
unnerved
and
shaking
like
a
leaf
spinrobin
pressed
her
against
his
heart
i
know
you
by
name
and
you
are
mine
he
tried
to
say
but
the
words
never
left
his
lips
it
was
the
love
surging
up
in
his
tortured
heart
that
alone
held
him
to
sanity
and
prevented
as
it
seemed
to
him
in
that
appalling
moment
the
dissolution
of
his
very
being
and
hers
for
philip
skale
had
somewhere
a
darting
zigzag
crack
as
of
lightning
ran
over
the
giant
fabric
of
vibrations
that
covered
the
altering
world
as
with
a
flood
and
sounds
that
no
man
may
hear
and
not
die
leaped
awfully
into
being
the
suddenness
and
immensity
of
the
catastrophe
blinded
these
two
listening
awe
and
terror
usurped
all
other
feelings
but
one
their
love
being
born
of
the
spirit
held
supreme
insulating
them
so
to
speak
from
all
invading
disasters
philip
skale
had
made
a
mistake
in
the
pronunciation
of
the
name
the
results
were
dreadful
and
immediate
and
from
all
the
surface
of
the
wakening
world
rose
anguished
voices
spinrobin
started
up
lifting
miriam
into
his
arms
he
spun
dizzily
for
a
moment
between
boulders
and
trees
giving
out
a
great
wailing
cry
unearthly
enough
had
there
been
any
to
hear
it
then
he
began
to
run
wildly
through
the
thick
darkness
in
his
ear
for
her
head
lay
close
he
heard
her
dear
voice
between
the
sobs
of
collapse
calling
his
inner
name
most
sweetly
and
the
sound
summoned
to
the
front
all
in
him
that
was
best
and
manly
my
sweet
master
my
sweet
master
but
he
did
not
run
far
about
him
on
every
side
the
night
lifted
as
though
it
were
suddenly
day
he
saw
the
summits
of
the
bleak
mountains
agleam
with
the
reflection
of
some
great
light
that
rushed
upon
them
from
the
valley
all
the
desolate
landscape
hesitating
like
some
hovering
ocean
between
the
old
pattern
and
the
new
seemed
to
hang
suspended
amid
the
desolation
of
the
winter
skies
everything
roared
it
seemed
the
ground
shook
the
very
bones
of
the
woods
went
shuddering
together
the
hills
toppled
and
overhead
in
some
incredible
depths
of
space
boomed
sounds
as
though
the
heavens
split
off
into
fragments
and
hurled
the
constellations
about
the
vault
to
swell
these
shattering
thunders
of
a
collapsing
world
the
letters
of
that
terrible
and
august
name
were
passing
over
the
face
of
the
universe
distorted
because
mispronounced
creative
sounds
disheveled
and
monstrous
because
incompletely
and
incorrectly
uttered
put
me
down
he
heard
miriam
cry
where
she
lay
smothered
in
his
arms
and
we
can
face
everything
together
and
be
safe
our
love
is
bigger
than
it
all
and
will
protect
us
because
it
is
complete
he
cried
incoherently
in
reply
seizing
the
truth
of
her
thought
and
setting
her
upon
the
ground
it
includes
even
this
it
is
a
part
of
the
name
correctly
uttered
for
it
is
true
and
pure
he
heard
her
calling
his
inner
name
and
he
began
forthwith
to
call
her
own
as
they
stood
there
clinging
to
one
another
mingling
arms
and
hair
and
lips
in
such
a
tumult
of
passion
that
it
seemed
as
though
all
this
outer
convulsion
of
the
world
was
a
small
matter
compared
to
the
commotion
in
their
own
hearts
revolutionized
by
the
influx
of
a
divine
love
that
sought
to
melt
them
into
a
single
being
and
as
they
looked
down
into
the
valley
at
their
feet
too
bewildered
to
resist
these
mighty
forces
that
stole
the
breath
from
their
throats
and
the
strength
from
their
muscles
they
saw
with
a
clearness
as
of
day
that
the
house
of
awe
in
which
their
love
had
wakened
and
matured
was
passing
away
and
being
utterly
consumed
in
a
flame
of
white
fire
tongued
and
sheeted
streaked
with
gulfs
of
black
and
most
terribly
roaring
it
rose
with
a
prodigious
crackling
of
walls
and
roof
towards
the
sky
volumes
of
colored
smoke
like
hills
moving
went
with
it
and
with
it
too
went
the
forms
the
substance
of
their
forms
at
least
of
their
sounds
released
of
philip
skale
mawle
and
all
the
paraphernalia
of
gongs
drapery
wires
sheeted
walls
and
the
preparations
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
of
labor
and
audacious
research
for
nothing
could
possibly
survive
in
such
a
furnace
the
heat
of
it
struck
their
faces
where
they
stood
even
here
high
upon
the
hills
and
the
currents
of
rising
wind
blew
the
tresses
across
his
eyes
and
moved
his
own
feathery
hair
upon
his
head
the
notes
of
those
leaping
flames
were
like
thunder
watch
now
cried
miriam
though
he
divined
the
meaning
from
the
gesture
of
her
free
hand
rather
than
actually
heard
the
words
and
leaning
their
trembling
bodies
against
a
great
boulder
behind
them
they
then
saw
in
the
midst
of
the
conflagration
or
hovering
dimly
above
it
rather
the
vast
outlines
of
the
captured
sounds
the
letters
escaping
back
again
into
the
womb
of
eternal
silence
from
which
they
had
been
with
such
appalling
courage
evoked
in
forms
of
dazzling
blackness
they
passed
upwards
in
their
chariots
of
flame
yet
at
the
same
time
passed
in
some
amazing
kind
of
spiral
motion
upon
their
own
axes
vanishing
away
with
incredible
swiftness
and
beauty
deep
down
into
themselves
and
were
gone
realizing
in
some
fashion
of
childhood
the
fearful
majesty
of
the
wrath
of
jehovah
yet
secretly
undismayed
because
each
felt
so
gloriously
lost
in
their
wonderful
love
the
bodies
of
miriam
and
spinrobin
dropped
instinctively
upon
their
knees
and
still
tightly
clasped
in
one
another
arms
bowed
their
foreheads
to
the
ground
touching
the
earth
and
leaves
but
how
long
they
rested
thus
upon
the
heart
of
the
old
earth
or
whether
they
slept
or
whether
possibly
the
inevitable
reaction
to
all
the
overstrain
of
the
past
hours
led
them
through
a
period
of
unconsciousness
neither
of
them
quite
knew
nor
was
it
possible
for
them
to
have
known
perhaps
that
the
lonely
valley
sheltering
the
house
of
awe
running
into
these
desolate
hills
had
the
unenviable
reputation
of
trembling
a
little
in
sympathy
with
any
considerable
shock
of
earthquake
that
came
to
move
that
portion
of
the
round
globe
from
her
sleep
of
this
they
knew
as
little
no
doubt
as
they
did
of
the
line
of
demarcation
between
experiences
that
are
objective
capable
of
being
weighed
and
measured
and
those
that
are
subjective
taking
place
though
with
convincing
authority
only
in
the
sphere
of
the
mind
all
they
do
know
and
spinrobin
tells
it
with
an
expression
of
supreme
happiness
upon
his
shining
round
face
is
that
at
length
they
stirred
as
they
lay
opened
their
eyes
turned
and
looked
at
one
another
then
stood
up
on
miriam
hair
and
lashes
lay
the
message
of
the
dew
and
in
her
clear
eyes
all
the
soft
beauty
of
the
stars
that
had
watched
over
them
but
the
stars
themselves
had
gone
over
the
hills
ran
the
colored
feet
of
the
dawn
swift
and
rosy
touching
the
spread
of
heathery
miles
with
the
tints
of
approaching
sunrise
the
tops
of
the
leafless
trees
stirred
gently
with
a
whisper
of
wind
that
stole
up
from
the
distant
sea
the
birds
were
singing
over
the
surface
of
the
old
earth
flew
the
magical
thrill
of
life
it
caught
these
two
sweeping
them
into
each
other
arms
as
with
wings
out
of
all
the
amazing
tempest
of
their
recent
experiences
emerged
this
splendor
of
their
deep
and
simple
love
the
kindly
earth
they
had
chosen
beckoned
them
down
into
the
valley
the
awful
heaven
they
had
rejected
smiled
upon
them
approvingly
as
the
old
sun
topped
the
hills
and
peeped
upon
them
with
his
glorious
eye
come
miriam
breathed
spinrobin
softly
into
her
little
ear
we
go
down
into
another
valley
and
live
happily
together
forever
and
ever
yes
she
murmured
blushing
with
the
rosiness
of
that
exquisite
winter
dawn
you
and
i
and
and
but
spinrobin
kissed
the
unborn
name
from
her
lips
hush
he
whispered
hush
for
the
little
word
between
these
two
was
not
yet
made
flesh
but
the
caught
up
that
hush
and
carried
it
to
the
trees
and
undergrowth
about
them
and
then
ran
before
them
to
whisper
it
to
the
valley
where
they
were
going
and
miriam
knowing
the
worship
and
protection
in
his
delicate
caress
looked
up
into
his
face
and
smiled
and
the
smile
in
her
grey
eyes
was
that
ancient
which
is
coeval
with
life
for
the
word
of
creation
flamed
in
these
two
hearts
waiting
only
to
be
uttered
