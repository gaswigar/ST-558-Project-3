headland
harbor
it
is
of
course
possible
perhaps
even
probable
that
somewhere
on
this
green
earth
there
may
be
finer
golf
links
or
a
more
attractive
clubhouse
than
those
at
headland
harbor
but
never
hope
to
wring
such
an
admission
from
any
one
of
the
summer
colony
who
spend
their
at
that
particular
portion
of
the
maine
coast
far
up
above
the
york
cliffs
are
more
great
crags
and
among
the
steepest
and
wildest
of
these
localities
a
few
venturesome
spirits
saw
fit
to
pitch
their
tents
others
joined
them
from
time
to
time
until
now
the
summer
population
occupied
nearly
a
hundred
cottages
and
bungalows
and
there
was
moreover
a
fair
sized
and
fairly
appointed
inn
many
of
the
regulars
were
artists
of
one
sort
or
another
but
also
came
the
less
talented
in
search
of
good
fishing
or
merely
good
idling
and
they
found
it
for
the
majority
of
the
householders
were
people
of
brains
as
well
as
talent
and
by
some
mysterious
management
the
tone
of
the
social
side
of
things
was
kept
pretty
much
as
it
should
be
wealth
counted
for
what
it
was
worth
and
no
more
genius
counted
in
the
same
way
and
was
never
overrated
good
nature
and
an
amusing
personality
were
perhaps
the
best
assets
one
could
bring
to
the
conservative
little
community
and
most
of
the
shining
lights
possessed
those
in
abundance
to
many
the
word
harbor
connotes
a
peaceful
serene
bit
of
blue
water
sheltered
from
rough
winds
and
basking
in
the
sunlight
this
is
far
from
a
description
of
headland
harbor
whose
rocky
shores
and
deep
black
waters
were
usually
and
often
to
a
wild
picturesqueness
beloved
of
the
picture
painters
but
there
were
some
midsummer
days
as
now
one
in
late
july
when
the
harbor
waters
lay
serene
and
the
sunlight
dipped
and
danced
on
the
tiny
wavelets
that
broke
into
spray
over
the
nearby
rocks
because
it
was
about
the
hour
of
noon
the
clubhouse
verandah
was
crowded
with
members
and
guests
waiting
for
the
mail
which
as
always
was
late
the
clubhouse
a
big
low
building
with
lots
of
shiny
paint
and
weathering
shingles
was
at
the
nearest
spot
consistent
with
safety
to
the
shore
from
it
could
be
had
a
magnificent
view
of
the
great
headland
that
named
the
place
this
gigantic
cliff
jutted
out
into
the
sea
and
rising
to
a
height
of
three
hundred
feet
the
mighty
crag
showed
a
slight
overhang
which
rendered
it
unscalable
the
wet
black
rock
glistened
in
the
sunlight
as
spray
from
the
dashing
breakers
broke
half
way
up
its
sides
the
top
was
a
long
and
narrow
tableland
not
much
more
than
large
enough
to
accommodate
the
house
that
crowned
the
summit
there
was
a
strip
of
sparse
lawn
on
either
side
the
old
mansion
and
a
futile
attempt
at
a
garden
but
vegetation
was
mostly
confined
to
the
weird
pine
trees
that
waved
the
branches
of
their
lee
sides
in
mournful
eerie
motions
can
t
see
how
any
one
wants
to
live
up
there
in
that
shack
said
john
clark
settling
more
comfortably
in
his
porch
rocker
and
lighting
a
fresh
cigarette
oh
i
think
it
s
great
mrs
blackwood
disagreed
with
him
so
you
know
if
you
say
picturesque
up
here
you
ll
be
excommunicated
the
thing
is
all
right
but
the
word
is
all
right
then
but
it
isn
t
that
clark
objected
it
s
more
like
an
old
steel
oh
not
with
all
that
color
said
lawrence
north
it
is
like
an
engraving
on
a
gray
cloudy
day
today
with
the
bright
water
and
vivid
sunshine
it
s
like
speak
it
right
out
cried
ted
landon
irrepressibly
like
a
picture
postcard
it
can
t
help
being
like
that
mrs
blackwood
agreed
for
the
postcards
for
sale
in
the
office
of
the
club
are
more
like
the
reality
than
any
picture
an
artist
has
ever
made
of
the
headland
of
course
photographs
are
truer
than
drawings
north
said
and
that
card
that
shows
the
cliff
in
a
storm
comes
pretty
near
being
a
work
of
the
difficulty
would
be
clark
observed
to
get
any
kind
of
a
picture
of
that
place
that
wouldn
t
be
a
work
of
art
why
the
architect
s
blueprints
of
that
house
would
come
a
good
deal
nearer
art
than
lots
of
watercolors
i
ve
seen
in
exhibitions
i
m
keen
on
the
who
isn
t
growled
landon
for
most
of
the
headlanders
resented
the
faintest
disparagement
of
their
cherished
masterpiece
a
joint
work
of
nature
and
man
the
promontory
was
joined
to
the
mainland
by
a
mere
narrow
neck
of
rocky
land
and
from
that
point
a
rough
road
descended
over
and
between
steep
hills
reaching
at
last
the
tiny
village
and
scattered
settlement
of
headland
harbor
headland
house
itself
was
a
modified
type
of
old
world
architecture
built
of
rough
gray
stone
equipped
with
a
few
towers
and
turrets
pierced
by
deep
and
narrow
windows
it
had
some
effects
of
a
french
chateau
and
others
that
suggested
an
old
english
castle
it
was
true
to
no
school
it
followed
no
definite
type
yet
perched
on
its
lonely
height
sharply
outlined
against
the
sky
its
majestic
rock
foundations
sweeping
away
from
beneath
it
it
showed
the
grandeur
and
sublimity
of
a
monument
and
partly
because
of
their
real
admiration
partly
because
of
a
spirit
of
ownership
the
artist
colony
loved
and
cherished
their
headland
house
with
a
jealous
sensitiveness
to
criticism
stunning
thing
here
john
clark
said
after
a
few
moments
of
further
smoking
and
gazing
all
the
same
as
i
stated
i
shouldn
t
care
to
live
up
too
difficult
of
access
claire
blackwood
said
but
otherwise
all
mrs
blackwood
was
a
widow
young
attractive
and
of
a
psychic
turn
of
mind
not
enough
of
an
occultist
to
make
her
a
bore
but
possessing
quick
and
sure
intuitions
and
claiming
some
slight
clairvoyant
powers
she
dabbled
in
water
colors
and
did
an
occasional
oil
she
was
with
long
fingers
and
long
feet
and
usually
had
a
long
scarf
of
some
gauzy
texture
trailing
about
her
of
an
evening
or
even
on
a
dressy
afternoon
she
had
a
long
panel
or
hanging
below
her
short
skirt
and
which
was
frequently
trodden
on
by
blundering
inattentive
feet
of
course
claire
blackwood
was
took
care
to
be
that
her
utmost
care
could
not
make
her
beautiful
to
her
own
chagrin
her
scarlet
lips
were
too
thin
and
the
angle
of
her
jaw
too
hard
yet
she
was
handsome
and
by
virtue
of
her
personality
and
her
implicit
belief
in
her
own
importance
she
was
the
leader
socially
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
colony
disclaimed
any
society
element
in
its
life
tell
us
about
the
headland
house
people
claire
you
ve
called
haven
t
you
this
from
ted
landon
who
by
reason
of
his
sheer
impudence
was
forgiven
any
unconventionality
no
other
man
at
the
harbor
would
have
dreamed
of
addressing
mrs
blackwood
by
her
first
name
yes
i
ve
called
they
re
delightful
the
words
said
more
than
the
tone
with
reservations
asked
north
oh
in
a
way
they
re
quite
all
right
s
only
that
they
re
not
picture
mad
we
all
ignorant
oh
no
that
well
i
ll
sketch
them
for
you
mr
varian
is
a
wall
street
man
magnate
yes
i
daresay
wealthy
anyway
he
s
big
and
well
mannered
a
bit
preoccupied
yes
we
get
what
you
mean
said
the
irrepressible
ted
go
on
about
the
daughter
i
haven
t
come
to
her
yet
the
mother
is
due
first
mrs
varian
is
the
clingingest
vine
i
ever
saw
i
only
saw
her
on
parade
of
course
but
i
m
positive
that
in
she
can
whine
and
fret
and
fly
into
nervous
spasms
her
husband
spoils
her
s
far
too
good
to
her
what
a
lot
you
gathered
at
one
interview
murmured
lawrence
north
that
s
what
i
went
for
mrs
blackwood
returned
coolly
well
mother
varian
is
wrapped
up
in
her
betty
is
a
peach
i
know
you
boys
will
agree
i
never
saw
greater
idolatry
in
any
mother
than
mrs
varian
betty
worth
it
asked
john
clark
idly
rather
mrs
blackwood
assured
him
she
s
a
dear
thing
i
don
t
often
enthuse
over
young
girls
but
betty
varian
is
as
how
prettier
than
most
girls
more
charm
better
manners
and
suspicion
of
brains
not
enough
to
hurt
her
but
enough
to
make
it
a
pleasure
to
talk
to
her
moreover
she
s
a
wilful
spoiled
petted
darling
of
two
worshipping
parents
and
it
s
greatly
to
her
credit
that
she
isn
t
an
arrogant
impossible
sounds
good
to
me
commented
ted
when
can
i
meet
her
i
ll
introduce
you
soon
they
want
to
meet
some
of
our
best
of
course
that
lets
me
in
at
once
when
will
you
take
me
tomorrow
afternoon
they
re
having
a
small
picnic
and
they
asked
me
to
bring
two
amusing
young
may
i
go
asked
lawrence
north
men
i
said
and
mrs
blackwood
looked
at
him
calmly
you
are
old
enough
to
be
betty
varian
s
father
well
since
i
m
not
that
needn
t
prevent
my
meeting
so
you
shall
some
time
but
i
m
to
take
two
tomorrow
and
do
you
think
i
said
i
would
bring
rodney
granniss
and
mr
varian
said
no
he
d
rather
i
asked
some
one
in
his
place
why
for
heaven
s
sake
cried
landon
rod
s
our
star
well
you
see
they
know
all
the
more
oh
it
s
this
way
rod
granniss
is
already
a
beau
of
betty
s
her
father
doesn
t
approve
of
the
not
approve
of
granniss
john
clark
looked
his
amazement
mr
varian
must
be
an
old
fuss
i
think
that
s
just
what
he
is
assented
claire
blackwood
and
then
ted
landon
urged
you
haven
t
described
the
siren
yet
what
s
she
like
to
look
at
a
little
thing
sylphish
rather
ways
quick
alert
motions
and
with
the
biggest
gray
eyes
you
ever
saw
with
raving
tresses
no
very
dark
brown
i
think
but
the
liveliest
coloring
cheeks
scarlet
lips
i
know
like
no
good
sound
white
teeth
and
fluttering
hands
that
emphasize
and
illustrate
all
she
all
right
she
ll
do
and
ted
looked
satisfied
i
can
cut
out
old
john
here
and
if
granniss
is
barred
i
ll
have
a
cinch
you
must
behave
yourself
first
anyway
because
i
am
responsible
for
you
be
ready
to
go
up
there
with
me
at
four
tomorrow
leave
here
at
four
yes
we
ll
walk
up
a
bit
of
a
climb
but
motors
can
go
only
to
the
lodge
you
know
and
that
s
not
worth
the
porter
s
lodge
belonging
to
headland
house
was
partly
visible
from
the
clubhouse
and
it
guarded
the
gates
that
gave
ingress
to
the
estate
there
was
no
other
mode
of
entrance
for
a
high
wall
ran
completely
across
the
narrow
neck
that
joined
the
headland
to
the
main
shore
and
all
other
sides
of
the
precipitous
cliff
ran
straight
down
to
the
sea
from
where
they
sat
the
group
could
discern
the
motor
road
as
far
as
the
lodge
and
here
and
there
above
that
could
be
glimpsed
the
narrow
tortuous
path
that
led
on
to
the
house
grim
old
pile
landon
said
looking
at
headland
house
any
spook
connected
with
its
history
i
never
heard
of
any
said
mrs
blackwood
did
you
mr
north
not
definitely
but
i
ve
heard
vague
rumors
of
old
legends
or
traditions
of
dark
oh
pshaw
i
don
t
believe
it
and
mrs
blackwood
shook
her
head
at
him
you
re
making
that
up
to
lend
an
added
interest
north
grinned
i
m
afraid
i
was
he
admitted
but
if
there
isn
t
any
legend
there
surely
ought
to
be
let
s
make
one
no
i
won
t
have
it
i
hate
haunted
houses
and
i
shan
t
allow
a
ghost
to
be
invented
the
place
is
too
beautiful
to
have
a
foolish
hackneyed
old
ghost
yarn
attached
to
it
just
because
you
were
up
here
last
summer
and
this
is
the
first
year
for
most
of
us
you
needn
t
think
you
can
rule
the
roost
very
well
lawrence
north
smiled
have
it
your
own
way
but
truly
i
heard
rumors
last
keep
them
to
yourself
then
and
when
you
meet
the
varians
as
of
course
you
will
don
t
say
anything
to
them
about
such
a
your
word
is
law
and
north
bowed
submissively
here
comes
the
mail
at
last
and
also
here
comes
granniss
disapproved
one
a
tall
young
man
appeared
and
throwing
himself
into
a
piazza
swing
asked
breezily
who
s
disapproving
of
me
now
somebody
with
absolute
lack
of
fine
perception
nobody
here
began
landon
and
then
a
warning
glance
from
claire
blackwood
prevented
his
further
disclosures
on
the
subject
don
t
make
a
secret
of
it
went
on
granniss
own
up
now
who
s
been
knocking
poor
little
me
i
said
mrs
blackwood
coolly
nixy
madame
claire
you
may
disapprove
of
me
but
you
re
not
the
one
i
mean
who
else
oh
let
s
tell
him
north
laughed
he
can
stand
the
shock
they
say
granniss
you
re
non
up
at
the
house
on
the
rodney
granniss
eyes
darkened
and
he
looked
annoyed
but
he
only
said
that
s
a
disapproval
any
one
may
obtain
by
the
simple
process
of
admiring
miss
really
asked
claire
blackwood
very
really
to
call
twice
is
to
incur
the
displeasure
of
one
or
both
parents
to
venture
a
third
time
is
to
be
crossed
out
of
the
guest
book
but
look
here
old
man
landon
said
they
ve
only
been
in
that
house
about
a
week
haven
t
you
been
rushing
things
i
knew
them
before
said
granniss
simply
i
ve
met
them
in
new
oh
well
then
their
dislike
of
you
is
evidently
but
this
impudence
of
landon
s
brought
forth
no
expression
of
resentment
from
its
victim
granniss
only
winked
at
ted
and
proceeded
to
look
over
his
letters
it
was
the
first
time
in
the
memory
of
any
of
the
present
of
headland
harbor
that
the
house
on
the
rocks
had
been
occupied
built
long
ago
it
was
so
difficult
of
access
and
so
high
priced
of
rental
that
no
one
had
cared
to
live
in
it
but
suddenly
and
for
no
known
reason
this
summer
it
had
been
rented
late
and
now
toward
the
end
of
july
the
new
tenants
were
only
fairly
settled
that
their
name
was
varian
was
about
all
that
was
known
of
them
until
mrs
blackwood
s
call
had
been
hospitably
received
and
she
brought
back
favorable
reports
of
the
family
it
seems
betty
was
anxious
to
meet
some
young
people
and
mrs
varian
was
glad
to
learn
from
her
caller
that
small
picnics
were
among
the
favored
modes
of
entertainment
and
she
decided
to
begin
that
way
next
day
she
explained
a
few
house
guests
would
arrive
and
if
mrs
blackwood
would
bring
two
or
three
young
men
and
come
herself
perhaps
that
would
be
enough
for
a
first
attempt
at
sociability
this
met
mrs
blackwood
s
entire
approval
and
she
proposed
rodney
granniss
name
all
unsuspecting
that
he
would
not
be
welcomed
he
s
all
right
you
understand
mrs
varian
had
said
not
being
then
present
but
he
s
too
fond
of
my
daughter
you
can
tell
know
i
want
the
child
to
have
a
good
time
but
i
want
her
to
have
a
lot
of
young
acquaintances
and
be
friendly
with
all
but
not
specially
interested
in
any
one
her
father
feels
the
same
way
fact
he
feels
more
strongly
about
it
even
than
i
do
so
this
time
please
leave
mr
granniss
out
of
this
was
all
plausible
enough
and
no
real
disparagement
to
rodney
so
mrs
blackwood
agreed
can
i
do
anything
for
you
she
asked
her
hostess
at
parting
have
you
everything
you
want
are
your
servants
satisfactory
not
in
every
respect
varian
frowned
but
we
re
lucky
to
keep
them
at
all
only
by
the
most
outrageous
concessions
i
assure
you
if
they
get
too
overbearing
i
may
have
to
let
some
of
them
let
me
know
in
that
case
and
i
may
be
able
to
help
you
and
with
a
few
further
amenities
claire
blackwood
went
away
but
if
i
were
one
of
her
servants
i
shouldn
t
stay
with
her
she
confided
later
to
a
trusted
friend
i
never
saw
a
more
foolishly
emotional
woman
she
almost
wept
when
she
told
me
about
her
cook
s
ingratitude
as
if
any
one
looked
for
appreciation
of
favors
in
a
cook
and
when
she
talked
about
betty
she
bubbled
over
with
such
enthusiasm
that
she
was
again
moved
to
tears
it
seems
her
first
two
little
ones
died
very
young
and
i
think
they
ve
always
feared
they
mightn
t
raise
betty
hence
the
spoiling
and
it
also
explains
observed
the
interested
friend
why
the
parents
discountenance
the
attentions
of
of
course
betty
is
twenty
and
that
is
surely
old
enough
to
begin
to
think
about
such
things
for
the
girl
and
doubtless
she
does
but
parents
never
realize
that
their
infants
are
growing
up
it
is
not
impossible
that
rod
granniss
and
miss
betty
have
progressed
much
further
along
the
road
to
arcady
than
her
elders
may
suspect
why
did
the
varians
come
here
rod
is
i
don
t
suppose
they
knew
it
maybe
betty
did
young
people
are
pretty
sharp
and
you
know
rod
was
here
in
june
then
he
went
away
and
only
returned
after
the
varians
arrived
yes
there
must
have
been
some
sort
of
collusion
on
the
part
of
the
maybe
not
i
daresay
miss
betty
has
lots
of
admirers
as
devoted
as
young
granniss
can
t
you
ask
me
to
the
picnic
not
this
one
it
s
very
small
and
there
are
to
be
some
guests
at
the
house
i
believe
the
family
interests
me
they
are
types
i
think
betty
is
more
than
an
ordinary
flutterbudget
like
most
of
the
very
young
girls
around
here
and
the
older
varians
are
really
worth
while
mr
varian
is
a
brooding
sort
feel
sorry
for
there
there
that
will
do
claire
when
you
feel
sorry
for
a
remember
you
began
by
being
sorry
for
lawrence
north
i
m
sorry
for
him
still
he
s
a
big
man
a
way
a
genius
yet
he
gets
nowhere
that
s
because
he
a
genius
but
he
s
a
widower
so
he
s
fair
quarry
don
t
go
to
feeling
sorry
for
married
oh
there
s
no
sentiment
in
my
sympathy
for
mr
varian
only
he
intrigues
me
because
of
his
restless
air
restrained
effect
as
if
he
were
using
every
effort
to
keep
himself
from
breaking
through
breaking
through
what
i
don
t
know
through
some
barrier
some
limit
that
he
has
fixed
for
tell
you
i
don
t
what
it
s
all
about
that
s
why
i
m
curious
you
well
curious
then
and
how
he
puts
up
with
that
wife
yet
he
s
fawningly
devoted
to
her
he
anticipates
her
slightest
wish
is
worried
sick
if
she
is
the
least
mite
incommoded
or
disturbed
i
know
he
d
lie
down
and
let
her
walk
on
him
if
she
even
looked
as
if
she
d
care
to
what
a
lot
you
read
into
a
man
s
natural
consideration
for
his
wife
but
it
s
there
i
m
no
fool
can
read
people
know
that
i
tell
you
that
man
is
under
his
wife
s
thumb
for
some
reason
far
more
potent
than
his
love
for
her
or
her
demand
for
affection
from
what
be
the
explanation
i
don
t
know
that
s
why
i
m
curious
i
m
going
to
find
out
though
and
that
without
the
varians
in
the
least
suspecting
my
efforts
wait
till
you
see
her
she
s
almost
eerie
she
s
so
emotional
not
noisy
or
even
verbally
expressive
but
her
face
is
a
study
in
nervous
excitement
she
seems
to
grab
at
the
heartstrings
of
a
mere
and
play
on
them
until
she
tears
them
out
good
gracious
you
make
her
out
a
vampire
i
think
she
is
a
silly
vamp
that
the
girls
joke
about
the
real
thing
chapter
ii
betty
varian
dad
you
re
absolutely
impossible
oh
come
now
betty
not
as
bad
as
that
just
because
i
don
t
agree
to
everything
you
but
you
agree
with
me
you
seem
to
be
opposed
on
principle
to
everything
i
suggest
or
want
it
s
always
been
like
that
from
the
time
i
was
born
old
was
i
dad
when
you
first
saw
me
mr
varian
looked
reminiscent
about
an
hour
old
i
think
he
replied
maybe
a
little
well
from
that
moment
until
this
you
have
persistently
taken
the
opposite
side
in
any
discussion
we
have
but
if
i
hadn
t
betty
there
would
have
been
no
discussion
and
usually
there
hasn
t
been
you
re
a
spoiled
baby
always
have
been
and
always
will
be
your
will
is
strong
and
as
it
has
almost
never
been
thwarted
or
even
curbed
you
have
grown
up
a
headstrong
wilful
perverse
young
woman
and
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
with
you
get
rid
of
me
dad
betty
s
laugh
rang
out
while
her
looks
quite
belied
the
rather
terrible
character
just
ascribed
to
her
one
foot
tucked
under
her
she
sat
in
a
veranda
swing
now
and
then
touching
her
toe
to
the
floor
to
keep
swaying
she
wore
a
sport
suit
whose
matching
hat
lay
beside
her
on
the
floor
her
vivid
laughing
face
with
its
big
gray
eyes
and
pink
cheeks
its
scarlet
lips
and
white
teeth
was
framed
by
a
mop
of
dark
brown
wavy
hair
now
tossed
by
the
strong
breeze
from
the
sea
the
veranda
overlooked
the
ocean
and
the
sunlit
waves
stretching
far
away
from
the
great
cliff
were
dotted
in
the
foreground
with
small
craft
frederick
varian
sat
on
the
veranda
rail
a
big
rather
man
with
the
early
gray
of
fifty
years
showing
in
his
hair
and
carefully
trimmed
vandyke
beard
his
air
was
naturally
confident
and
but
in
the
face
of
this
chit
of
a
girl
he
somehow
found
himself
at
a
disadvantage
betty
dear
he
took
another
tack
can
t
you
understand
the
fatherly
love
that
can
not
bear
the
idea
of
parting
with
a
beloved
daughter
oh
yes
but
a
father
s
love
ought
to
think
what
is
for
that
daughter
s
happiness
then
he
ought
to
make
the
gigantic
that
may
be
a
dimple
came
into
betty
s
cheek
and
she
smiled
roguishly
yet
with
a
canny
eye
toward
the
effect
she
was
making
but
varian
looked
moodily
out
over
the
sea
i
won
t
have
it
he
said
sternly
i
suppose
i
have
some
authority
in
this
matter
and
i
forbid
you
to
encourage
any
young
man
to
the
point
of
a
proposal
or
even
to
think
of
becoming
how
can
i
ward
off
a
proposal
dad
betty
inquired
with
an
innocent
air
don
t
be
foolish
of
course
you
can
do
that
any
girl
with
your
intelligence
knows
just
when
an
acquaintance
crosses
the
line
of
mere
oh
daddy
you
are
funny
and
when
you
crossed
the
line
of
mere
friendship
with
mother
did
she
do
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject
now
mind
betty
i
am
not
jesting
am
not
talking
you
sound
very
much
like
it
i
m
not
i
m
very
much
in
earnest
you
are
not
to
encourage
the
definite
attentions
of
all
right
let
rod
granniss
come
up
here
then
and
i
promise
not
to
encourage
he
shall
not
come
up
here
because
he
has
already
gone
too
far
and
you
have
encouraged
him
too
but
i
love
him
daddy
i
think
you
hush
that
s
enough
don
t
let
me
hear
another
word
now
or
ever
regarding
granniss
he
is
crossed
off
our
acquaintance
and
if
he
persists
in
staying
here
we
will
go
away
why
father
we
ve
only
just
come
i
know
it
and
i
came
here
thinking
to
get
you
away
from
that
man
he
followed
us
up
here
he
was
here
before
we
came
but
he
didn
t
come
until
he
knew
we
were
all
right
he
came
because
he
wanted
to
be
where
i
am
and
i
want
to
be
where
he
is
and
you
d
better
be
careful
father
or
i
may
take
the
bit
in
my
teeth
and
run
off
with
him
that
s
why
i
came
here
you
can
t
get
away
you
perfectly
well
know
that
there
s
no
way
down
from
this
house
but
by
that
one
narrow
path
suppose
you
ve
no
intention
of
jumping
into
the
sea
love
will
find
a
way
betty
sang
saucily
it
isn
t
love
betty
it
s
a
miserable
childish
infatuation
that
will
pass
at
once
if
you
lose
sight
of
the
chap
for
a
short
nothing
of
the
sort
it
s
the
love
of
my
life
varian
laughed
that
s
a
phrase
but
it
doesn
t
mean
anything
now
child
be
reasonable
give
up
granniss
be
friends
with
all
the
young
people
up
here
boys
and
girls
both
but
don
t
let
me
hear
any
foolishness
about
being
engaged
to
do
you
mean
for
me
never
to
marry
father
i
d
rather
you
didn
t
my
dear
can
t
you
be
content
to
spend
your
days
with
your
devoted
parents
think
what
we
ve
done
for
you
what
we
ve
given
you
dad
you
make
me
tired
what
have
you
given
me
what
have
you
done
for
me
more
than
any
parents
do
for
a
child
you
ve
given
me
a
home
food
and
clothing
loving
care
what
else
and
what
do
i
owe
you
for
that
except
my
own
love
and
gratitude
but
i
don
t
owe
you
the
sacrifice
of
the
natural
normal
expectation
of
a
home
and
husband
of
my
own
i
m
twenty
s
quite
old
enough
to
think
of
such
things
pray
remember
how
old
mother
was
when
she
married
you
she
was
nineteen
suppose
her
father
had
talked
to
her
as
you
re
talking
to
me
what
would
you
have
said
to
him
i
d
like
to
know
by
this
time
fred
varian
was
walking
with
quick
short
strides
up
and
down
the
veranda
betty
rose
and
faced
him
standing
directly
in
his
path
father
she
said
speaking
seriously
you
are
all
wrong
you
don
t
know
what
you
re
talking
that
will
do
betty
when
varian
s
temper
was
roused
he
could
speak
very
harshly
and
did
so
now
hush
i
will
not
hear
such
words
from
you
how
dare
you
tell
me
i
don
t
know
what
i
m
talking
about
now
you
make
up
your
mind
to
obey
me
or
i
ll
cut
off
all
your
association
with
the
young
people
i
ll
shut
you
hush
yourself
dad
you
re
talking
rubbish
and
you
know
it
shut
me
up
in
a
turret
of
the
castle
i
suppose
on
bread
and
water
i
suppose
what
kind
of
nonsense
is
that
you
ll
see
whether
it
s
nonsense
or
not
what
do
you
suppose
i
took
this
isolated
place
for
except
to
keep
you
here
if
you
grow
too
independent
do
you
know
there
is
no
way
you
can
escape
if
i
choose
to
make
you
a
prisoner
and
if
that
s
the
only
way
to
break
your
spirit
i
ll
do
it
why
father
varian
betty
looked
a
little
scared
whatever
has
come
over
you
i
ve
made
up
my
mind
that
s
all
for
twenty
years
i
ve
humored
you
and
indulged
you
and
acceded
to
your
every
wish
you
ve
been
petted
and
spoiled
until
you
think
you
are
the
only
dictator
in
this
family
now
a
time
has
come
when
i
have
put
my
foot
well
pick
it
up
again
daddy
and
all
will
be
betty
smiled
and
attempted
to
kiss
the
belligerent
face
looking
down
at
her
but
frederick
varian
repulsed
the
offered
caress
and
said
sternly
i
want
no
affection
from
a
wilful
disobedient
child
give
me
your
word
betty
to
respect
my
wishes
and
i
ll
always
be
glad
of
your
loving
but
betty
was
angry
now
i
ll
give
you
no
such
promise
i
shall
conduct
myself
as
i
please
with
my
friends
and
my
acquaintances
you
know
me
well
enough
to
know
that
i
never
do
anything
that
is
in
bad
form
or
in
bad
taste
if
i
choose
to
flirt
with
the
young
men
or
even
as
you
call
it
encourage
them
i
propose
to
do
so
and
i
resent
your
interference
and
i
deny
your
right
to
forbid
me
in
such
matters
and
too
i
ll
go
so
far
as
to
warn
you
that
if
you
persist
in
this
queer
attitude
you
ve
taken
ll
be
sorry
remember
that
betty
s
eyes
flashed
but
she
was
quiet
rather
than
excited
varian
himself
was
nervous
and
agitated
his
fingers
clenched
and
his
lips
trembled
with
the
intensity
of
his
feelings
and
as
betty
voiced
her
rebellious
thoughts
he
stared
at
her
in
amazement
what
you
two
quarreling
about
came
the
surprised
accents
of
mrs
varian
as
she
came
out
through
the
french
window
from
the
library
and
looked
curiously
at
them
oh
mother
betty
cried
dad
s
gone
nutty
he
says
i
never
can
marry
what
nonsense
fred
she
did
not
take
it
at
all
seriously
of
course
betty
will
marry
some
day
but
not
yet
don
t
bother
about
it
at
but
daddy
s
bothering
very
much
about
it
at
present
at
least
he
s
bothering
me
t
let
little
betty
be
bothered
mummy
you
let
her
alone
fred
why
do
you
tease
the
child
i
declare
you
two
are
always
at
odds
over
something
no
minna
that
s
not
so
i
always
indulge
oh
yes
after
i
ve
coaxed
you
to
do
so
you
re
an
unnatural
father
fred
you
seem
possessed
to
frown
on
all
betty
s
innocent
i
don
t
want
her
getting
married
and
going
off
and
leaving
he
growled
still
looking
angry
well
the
baby
isn
t
even
engaged
yet
t
begin
to
worry
and
too
that
is
in
the
mother
s
not
entirely
i
rather
guess
a
father
has
some
authority
oh
yes
if
it
s
exercised
with
loving
care
and
discretion
don
t
you
bother
betty
anyway
father
and
mother
will
settle
this
little
argument
by
i
d
rather
settle
it
with
dad
betty
declared
spiritedly
it
s
too
ridiculous
for
him
to
take
the
stand
that
i
shall
never
marry
i
m
willing
to
promise
not
to
become
engaged
without
asking
you
both
first
i
m
willing
to
say
i
won
t
marry
a
man
you
can
convince
me
is
unworthy
i
m
willing
to
promise
anything
in
reason
a
blind
promise
never
to
marry
is
too
much
to
ask
of
any
girl
of
course
it
is
agreed
mrs
varian
why
do
you
talk
to
her
like
that
fred
because
i
propose
to
have
my
own
way
for
once
i
ve
given
in
to
you
two
in
every
particular
for
twenty
years
or
more
now
i
assert
myself
i
say
betty
shall
not
marry
and
i
shall
see
to
it
that
she
does
not
oh
my
heavens
and
mrs
varian
wrung
her
hands
with
a
wail
of
nervous
pettishness
sometimes
fred
i
think
you
re
crazy
at
any
rate
you
ll
set
me
crazy
if
you
talk
like
that
do
stop
this
quarrel
anyhow
kiss
and
make
up
won
t
you
to
think
of
you
two
the
only
human
beings
on
earth
that
i
care
a
rap
for
acting
like
this
my
husband
and
my
child
the
only
things
i
live
for
the
apple
of
my
eye
the
core
of
my
soul
both
of
you
t
you
see
how
you
distress
me
when
you
are
at
odds
and
you
re
always
at
odds
always
squabbling
over
some
little
thing
but
heretofore
you
ve
always
laughed
and
agreed
finally
now
forget
this
foolishness
it
isn
t
foolishness
and
varian
set
his
lips
together
doggedly
no
it
isn
t
foolishness
said
betty
quietly
but
with
a
look
of
indomitable
determination
well
stop
it
at
any
rate
begged
mrs
varian
if
you
don
t
i
shall
go
into
hysterics
it
s
time
now
for
the
herberts
to
now
both
fred
and
betty
knew
that
a
suggestion
of
hysterics
was
no
idle
threat
for
minna
varian
could
achieve
the
most
annoying
demonstrations
of
that
sort
at
a
moment
s
notice
and
it
was
quite
true
that
the
expected
guests
were
imminent
but
no
truce
was
put
into
words
for
just
then
a
party
of
three
people
came
in
sight
and
neared
the
veranda
steps
the
three
were
frederick
varian
s
brother
herbert
and
his
wife
and
daughter
this
family
was
called
the
herberts
to
distinguish
them
from
the
frederick
varian
household
the
daughter
eleanor
was
a
year
or
two
younger
than
betty
and
the
girls
were
friendly
though
of
widely
differing
tastes
the
brothers
varian
were
much
alike
but
the
two
matrons
were
as
opposite
as
it
is
possible
for
two
women
to
be
mrs
herbert
was
a
strong
character
almost
she
had
no
patience
with
her
s
nerves
or
hysterical
tendencies
it
would
indeed
be
awkward
if
the
herberts
were
to
arrive
in
the
midst
of
one
of
mrs
frederick
s
exhibitions
of
temperamental
disturbance
wonderful
place
exclaimed
herbert
varian
as
they
ascended
the
steps
to
the
verandah
great
old
boy
i
never
saw
anything
like
reminds
me
of
the
prisoner
of
chillon
or
the
castle
of
otranto
said
mrs
herbert
climbing
that
steep
path
reminded
me
of
the
solitary
horseman
herbert
interrupted
his
wife
whew
let
me
sit
down
i
m
too
weighty
a
person
to
visit
your
castled
crag
of
drachenfels
very
often
whew
poor
uncle
herbert
cooed
betty
it
s
an
awful
long
steep
pull

your
breath
and
i

get
you

nice
cool
fruit
punch

the
servants

gone
to
the
circus
last
one
of
oh

eleanor
said
as
she
went

betty

party

picnic

the
proper
caper

here
and
only
a
little
one

the
men

them
we
go
to
a
lovely
picnic
place
very
far
we
all
help
get
the
supper
you
see
up
here
if
you
don
t
let
the
servants
go
off
skylarking
every
so
often
they
i
should
think
they
would
exclaimed
eleanor
earnestly
i
m
ready
to
leave
now
how
do
you
stand
it
betty
i
think
it
s
fearful
oh
it
isn
t
the
sort
of
thing
you
d
like
i
know
put
those
glasses
on
that
tray
will
you
nell
but
i
love
this
wild
craggy
place
it
s
like
an
eagle
s
eyrie
and
i
adore
the
solitude
as
there
are
plenty
of
people
and
a
golf
club
and
an
artist
colony
and
all
sorts
of
nice
things
in
easy
you
mean
that
little
village
or
settlement
we
came
through
on
the
way
from
the
station
yes
and
a
few
of
their
choicest
inhabitants
are
coming
up
this
afternoon
for
our
that
sounds
better
eleanor
sighed
but
i
d
never
want
to
stay
here
is
rod
grannis
here

that
why

came
hush
nell
don

least
not
before
father
you
see
dad

down
on
down
on
rod
why
for
only
because

s
too
fond
of
little
who

laughed
both
of
em
but
i
mean
dad
is
down
on
any
young
man
who
s
specially
interested
in
oh
i
know
so
is
my
father
i
don
t
let
it
bother
me
fathers
are
all
like
that
most
of
the
girls
i
know
say
yes
i
know
it
s
a
fatherly
failing
but
dad
is
especially
rabid
on
the
subject
there
you
take
the
basket
of
cakes
and
i
ll
carry
the
it
was
nearly
five
o
clock
when
the
picnic
party
was
finally
ready
to
start
for
its
junketing
mrs
blackwood
had
arrived
bringing
her
two
promised
young
men
ted
landon
and
john
clark
rearrayed
in
picnic
garb
the
house
guests
were
ready
for
the
fun
and
the
frederick
varians
were
getting
together
and
looking
over
the
baskets
of
supper
if
we
could
only
have
kept
one
helper
by
us
bemoaned
minna
varian
her
speech
accompanied
by
her
usual
wringing
of
her
distressed
hands
i
begged
kelly
to
stay
but
he
wouldn
the
circus
is
here
only
one
day
you
know
mrs
varian
landon
told
her
and
i
fancy
every
servant
in
headland
harbor
has
gone
to
it
but
command
indeed
we
will
put
in
betty
carry
this
please
and
uncle
herbert
you
take
this
coffee
divided
among
the
willing
hands
the
luggage
was
not
too
burdensome
and
the
cavalcade
prepared
to
start
no
fear
of
burglars
i
take
it
said
herbert
as
his
brother
closed
the
front
door
and
shook
it
to
be
sure
it
was
fastened
not
a
bit
and
frederick
varian
took
up
his
own
baskets
no
one
can
possibly
reach
this
house
save
through
that
gate
down
by
the
lodge
and
that
is
locked
also
the
windows
and
doors
of
the
house
are
all
fastened
so
if
you
people
have
left
jewelry
on
your
dressing
tables
don
t
be
alarmed
you
ll
find
it
there
on
your
all
aboard
shouted
landon
and
they
started
by
twos
or
threes
but
in
a
moment
were
obliged
to
walk
single
file
down
the
steep
and
narrow
path
oh
my
heavens
cried
betty
suddenly
i
must
go
back
i
ve
forgotten
my
camera
let
me
take
your
key
father
i
ll
run
and
get
it
in
a
minute
i
ll
go
and
get
it
for
you
betty
said
varian
setting
down
his
burden
no
dad
you
can
t
it
s
in
a
closet
behind
a
lot
of
other
things
and
you
d
upset
the
whole
lot
into
a
dreadful
mess
i
know
you
let
me
go
miss
varian
offered
several
of
the
others
but
betty
was
insistent
no
one
can
get
it
but
myself
least
not
without
a
lot
of
delay
and
trouble
give
me
the
key
father
i
ll
be
right
but
oh
give
her
the
key
fred
exclaimed
his
wife
don
t
torment
the
child
i
believe
you
enjoy
teasing
her
there
take
the
key
betty
and
run
along
hurry
do
for
it
s
annoying
to
have
to
wait
for
let
me
go
with
you
asked
john
clark
but
betty
smiled
a
refusal
and
ran
off
alone
most
of
them
watched
the
lithe
slight
figure
as
she
bounded
up
the
rugged
irregular
steps
sometimes
two
of
them
at
a
time
and
at
last
they
saw
her
fitting
the
key
into
the
front
door
she
called
back
a
few
words
but
the
distance
was
too
great
for
them
to
hear
her
clearly
although
they
could
see
her
she
waved
her
hand
smilingly
and
disappeared
inside
the
house
leaving
the
door
wide
open
behind
her
extraordinary
place
herbert
varian
said
taking
in
the
marvelous
crag
from
this
new
viewpoint
you
must
see
it
from
the
clubhouse
said
landon
can
t
you
all
come
here
tomorrow
afternoon
on
my
invite
we
ll
see
mrs
varian
smiled
at
him
for
it
was
impossible
not
to
like
this
frank
youth
the
conversation
was
entirely
of
the
wonders
and
beauties
of
headland
house
until
at
last
mrs
blackwood
said
isn
t
that
child
gone
a
long
while
i
could
have
found
half
a
dozen
cameras
by
this
time
she
is
a
long
time
frederick
varian
said
frowning
i
was
just
thinking
that
myself
i
think
i
ll
go
after
no
don
t
said
his
wife
nervously
you
ll
get
into
an
argument
with
her
and
never
get
back
let
her
alone
ll
be
here
in
a
but
the
minutes
went
by
and
betty
didn
t
reappear
in
the
open
doorway
i
know
what
she
s
up
to
and
frederick
varian
shook
his
head
in
annoyance
whereupon
mrs
frederick
began
to
cry
now
fred
stop
she
said
herbert
you
go
up
to
the
house
and
tell
betty
to
come
along
if
she
can
t
find
her
camera
tell
her
to
come
without
it
i
wish
we
had
a
megaphone
so
we
could
call
her
go
on
stay
where
you
are
herbert
said
his
brother
i
shall
go
it
s
all
right
minna
i
won
t
tease
the
child
promise
you
it
s
all
right
he
kissed
his
wife
lightly
on
the
brow
and
started
off
at
a
swinging
pace
up
the
rocky
flight
of
steps
i
ll
fetch
her
he
called
back
as
he
proceeded
beyond
hearing
distance
chirk
up
minna
janet
tell
her
i
shan
t
abuse
what
does
he
mean
by
that
asked
mrs
herbert
of
mrs
frederick
as
she
repeated
the
message
oh
nothing
and
mrs
frederick
clasped
her
hands
resignedly
only
you
know
how
betty
and
her
father
are
always
more
or
less
at
odds
i
don
t
know
why
it
is
re
devoted
to
each
other
yet
they
re
always
they
don
t
mean
anything
and
her
smiled
i
know
them
both
and
they
re
an
ideal
father
and
chapter
iii
the
tragedy
doctor
herbert
varian
stood
slightly
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
group
his
observant
eyes
taking
in
all
the
details
of
the
peculiar
situation
of
his
brother
s
house
his
eye
traversed
back
over
the
short
distance
they
had
already
come
and
he
saw
a
narrow
winding
and
exceedingly
steep
path
at
intervals
it
was
a
succession
of
broken
irregular
steps
rocky
and
again
it
would
be
a
fairly
easy
though
stony
footway
but
it
led
to
the
house
and
had
no
branch
or
side
track
in
any
direction
everything
and
everybody
that
comes
to
this
house
has
to
come
by
this
path
he
demanded
yes
said
minna
varian
and
added
complainingly
a
most
disagreeable
arrangement
all
the
servants
and
tradespeople
have
to
use
it
as
well
as
ourselves
and
our
that
could
be
remedied
suggested
varian
a
branch
we
ll
never
do
it
said
minna
sharply
i
don
t
like
the
place
well
enough
to
buy
it
though
that
is
what
fred
has
in
no
don
t
buy
it
advised
her
i
see
nothing
in
its
favor
except
its
wonderful
beauty
and
strange
weird
charm
that
s
a
good
deal
i
admit
but
not
enough
for
a
comfortable
summer
he
turned
and
gazed
out
over
the
open
sea
from
the
high
headland
the
view
was
unsurpassable
the
few
nearby
boats
seemed
lost
in
the
great
expanse
of
waters
some
chugging
motor
boats
and
a
dozen
or
so
sailing
craft
ventured
not
very
far
from
shore
north
along
the
maine
coast
he
saw
only
more
rocky
promontories
and
rockbound
inlets
turning
slowly
toward
the
south
he
saw
the
graceful
curve
of
headland
harbor
with
its
grouped
village
houses
and
spreading
array
of
summer
cottages
i
never
saw
anything
finer
he
declared
i
almost
think
minna
after
all
you
would
be
wise
to
buy
the
place
and
then
arrange
to
make
it
more
getatable
a
continuous
flight
of
strong
wooden
would
spoil
the
whole
thing
exclaimed
claire
blackwood
oh
doctor
varian
don
t
propose
anything
like
that
we
harborers
love
this
place
just
as
it
is
and
we
would
defend
it
against
any
such
innovations
i
think
there
s
a
law
about
defacing
natural
don
t
bother
said
minna
carelessly
we
ll
never
do
anything
of
the
sort
i
won
t
agree
to
that
s
right
said
her
this
is
no
place
to
bring
up
betty
the
girl
has
no
real
society
here
no
advantages
no
scope
she
ll
become
a
not
betty
minna
varian
laughed
she
s
and
all
that
but
she
has
nothing
of
the
barbarian
in
her
i
think
she
d
like
to
go
to
a
far
gayer
resort
but
her
where
is
her
father
asked
doctor
varian
impatiently
it
will
be
dark
before
we
get
to
our
picnic
why
don
t
they
come
he
gave
a
loud
but
only
the
echoes
from
the
rocky
heights
answered
him
i
knew
it
and
minna
varian
began
to
wring
her
hands
he
and
betty
are
quarreling
am
sure
of
it
what
do
you
mean
min
what
s
this
quarreling
business
about
they
ve
always
done
it
s
nothing
new
they
adore
each
other
but
they
re
eternally
disagreeing
and
fighting
it
out
they
re
quite
capable
of
forgetting
all
about
us
and
arguing
out
some
foolish
subject
while
we
sit
here
waiting
for
them
i
ll
go
and
stir
them
up
the
doctor
said
starting
in
the
direction
of
the
house
oh
no
herbert
it
s
a
hard
climb
and
you
ve
enough
walking
ahead
of
i
ll
go
and
ted
landon
looked
inquiringly
at
mrs
varian
oh
what
s
the
use
she
said
they
ll
surely
appear
in
a
so
they
all
waited
a
few
minutes
longer
and
then
janet
varian
spoke
up
i
think
it
s
a
shame
to
keep
us
here
like
this
go
on
up
to
the
house
mr
landon
do
tell
those
two
foolish
people
that
they
must
come
on
or
the
picnic
will
proceed
without
all
right
said
ted
and
began
sprinting
over
the
rocks
i
m
going
too
and
claire
blackwood
followed
landon
we
may
as
well
all
go
and
have
our
picnic
on
our
own
verandah
said
minna
complainingly
and
though
doctor
varian
would
have
preferred
that
to
any
further
exertions
he
did
not
say
so
it
s
always
like
this
minna
s
querulous
voice
went
on
whenever
we
start
to
go
anywhere
somebody
has
to
go
back
for
something
and
they
re
so
slow
and
so
inconsiderate
of
other
people
s
there
they
go
interrupted
doctor
varian
as
the
two
latest
emissaries
went
up
over
the
rocks
now
the
house
will
swallow
them
up
oh
herbert
don
t
say
such
awful
things
wailed
minna
you
sound
positively
creepy
i
have
a
feeling
of
fear
of
that
house
anyway
believe
it
would
like
to
swallow
people
up
ought
we
to
intrude
claire
blackwood
laughingly
asked
of
landon
as
they
neared
the
house
if
betty
and
her
father
want
to
quarrel
they
ought
to
be
allowed
to
do
so
in
oh
well
if
they
insist
we
ll
go
away
again
and
let
them
have
it
out
comfortably
queer
thing
for
daughter
and
dad
to
make
a
habit
of
scrapping
i
take
mrs
varian
s
statements
with
a
grain
of
salt
said
claire
sagely
she
s
not
awfully
well
balanced
that
woman
and
i
doubt
if
betty
and
her
father
are
half
as
black
as
they
re
painted
shall
we
ring
the
bell
or
walk
right
in
but
this
question
needed
no
answer
for
as
they
mounted
the
steps
of
the
verandah
and
neared
the
open
front
door
they
were
confronted
by
the
sight
of
mr
frederick
varian
sprawled
at
full
length
on
the
floor
of
the
hall
oh
heavens
what
is
the
matter
cried
claire
the
man
has
had
a
stroke
or
something
landon
went
nearer
and
with
a
grave
face
stooped
down
to
the
prostrate
figure
claire
he
whispered
looking
up
at
her
with
a
white
face
claire
this
man
is
what
no
it
can
t
yes
he
is
m
almost
certain
don
t
think
i
d
better
touch
him
should
i
it
can
do
no
harm
to
feel
for
his
heart
it
is
not
beating
does
it
mean
where
s
miss
varian
think
quickly
mr
landon
what
we
ought
to
claire
blackwood
spoke
earnestly
and
tried
to
pull
herself
together
we
must
be
careful
to
do
the
right
thing
i
should
say
before
we
even
think
of
miss
betty
we
should
call
doctor
varian
up
the
very
thing
will
you
call
him
or
shall
i
considerately
landon
gave
her
her
choice
with
a
shuddering
glance
at
the
still
figure
claire
said
you
call
him
but
let
me
go
with
they
stepped
out
on
the
veranda
and
landon
waved
his
hand
at
the
group
of
waiting
people
below
him
then
he
beckoned
but
no
one
definitely
responded
i
ll
have
to
shout
ted
said
with
a
regretful
look
somehow
i
hate
to
the
presence
of
death
seemed
to
restrain
him
but
of
necessity
he
called
out
doctor
varian
the
distance
was
almost
too
far
for
his
voice
to
carry
but
because
of
his
imperative
gestures
herbert
varian
said
guess
i
ll
have
to
go
lord
what
can
be
the
trick
they
re
trying
to
cut
up
i
vow
i
won
t
come
back
here
i
ll
eat
my
picnic
in
your
as
you
like
she
returned
indifferently
i
hate
picnics
anyway
but
for
goodness
sake
herbert
do
one
thing
or
the
other
if
you
d
really
rather
not
go
to
the
woods
take
your
baskets
and
we
ll
all
go
back
to
the
house
it
s
getting
late
wait
a
bit
counseled
the
doctor
you
people
stay
here
till
i
go
up
to
the
house
and
see
what
s
doing
then
if
i
beckon
you
come
along
back
all
of
you
if
i
don
t
break
my
neck
getting
up
there
don
t
go
father
begged
eleanor
let
me
go
what
in
the
world
can
they
want
of
you
no
ll
go
i
suppose
there
s
a
leak
in
the
pipes
or
herbert
varian
went
off
at
a
gait
that
belied
his
recalcitrant
attitude
and
as
he
neared
the
house
he
could
see
the
white
faces
and
grave
air
of
the
two
that
awaited
him
what
s
the
great
idea
he
called
out
cheerily
a
serious
matter
doctor
varian
replied
landon
an
accident
or
sudden
no
the
doctor
took
the
remaining
steps
at
a
bound
who
for
answer
landon
conducted
him
inside
the
hall
and
in
an
instant
varian
was
on
his
knees
beside
the
stricken
man
my
god
he
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
frederick
s
dead
a
stroke
asked
landon
while
claire
blackwood
stood
by
unable
to
speak
at
all
no
man
no
shot
see
the
blood
through
the
heart
what
does
can
it
mean
where
s
betty
we
don
t
know
claire
spoke
now
doctor
varian
are
you
sure
he
s
dead
can
nothing
be
done
to
save
him
nothing
he
died
almost
instantly
from
internal
hemorrhage
but
how
unbelievable
how
impossible
who
shot
him
landon
burst
out
impetuously
or
it
suicide
where
s
the
pistol
said
the
doctor
looking
about
both
men
searched
landon
trying
to
overcome
his
repugnance
to
such
close
association
with
the
dead
but
no
weapon
of
any
sort
could
be
found
can
t
see
it
varian
wiped
his
perspiring
brow
i
can
t
see
any
solution
but
this
won
t
do
we
must
get
the
others
up
here
oh
heavens
what
shall
we
do
with
minna
let
me
go
down
and
take
her
home
with
me
suggested
claire
blackwood
eager
to
do
anything
that
might
help
or
ease
the
coming
disclosure
of
the
tragedy
oh
i
don
t
know
demurred
varian
you
see
she
s
got
to
know
course
she
must
be
told
at
once
then
ll
have
to
look
after
betty
is
the
child
anyway
my
wife
is
a
tower
of
strength
ll
be
able
to
manage
mrs
varian
if
she
has
violent
hysterics
of
course
she
will
command
me
doctor
varian
said
landon
i
will
do
whatever
you
all
right
i
ll
be
glad
of
your
assistance
suppose
you
go
back
to
the
people
down
there
on
the
rocks
and
then
me
see
you
tell
my
wife
first
what
has
happened
then
ask
her
to
break
the
news
to
mrs
varian
ll
know
how
best
to
do
it
then
lord
don
t
know
what
then
they
ll
have
to
come
back
here
suppose
else
can
they
do
i
don
t
know
mrs
blackwood
but
your
idea
of
taking
mrs
varian
away
with
you
is
a
good
one
if
she
ll
she
won
t
go
said
claire
decidedly
if
she
knows
the
truth
if
i
take
her
it
ll
have
to
be
on
some
false
pretense
won
t
do
said
varian
briefly
we
ve
got
no
right
to
keep
her
in
ignorance
of
her
husband
s
death
no
she
must
be
told
that
girl
of
mine
too
she
hasn
t
her
mother
s
poise
s
likely
to
go
to
pieces
does
in
the
presence
of
death
oh
what
a
moil
here
s
another
thing
said
landon
a
little
hesitantly
what
about
the
authorities
yes
the
doctor
spoke
impatiently
i
thought
of
that
are
they
in
this
place
town
constable
i
i
don
t
know
myself
said
landon
county
sheriff
more
likely
but
clark
s
a
good
sensible
sort
say
we
send
him
down
to
the
oh
must
it
be
known
down
there
right
away
cried
claire
before
even
mrs
varian
is
told
or
betty
where
is
betty
betty
is
somewhere
in
the
house
said
doctor
varian
in
a
low
voice
we
know
that
now
let
that
question
rest
till
we
decide
on
our
first
move
i
think
landon
you
d
better
do
as
i
said
go
and
tell
my
wife
and
while
she
s
telling
mrs
varian
and
my
daughter
eleanor
you
can
take
mr
clark
aside
and
tell
him
then
i
think
you
d
all
better
come
back
here
to
the
house
we
ll
send
clark
on
that
errand
later
we
can
landon
started
on
his
difficult
descent
and
on
his
even
more
difficult
errand
can
t
you
t
you
put
mr
varian
claire
began
incoherently
i
m
not
supposed
to
move
a
body
until
the
authorities
give
permission
said
doctor
varian
slowly
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
this
very
peculiar
and
unusual
case
that
i
might
that
s
just
it
i
ve
been
thinking
the
very
mysteriousness
of
this
thing
makes
it
most
necessary
for
me
to
be
unusually
circumspect
why
mrs
blackwood
have
you
any
idea
what
we
have
ahead
of
us
i
can
t
think
this
mystery
will
be
simple
or
easily
explained
i
don
what
do
you
i
don
t
dare
think
isn
t
there
a
phrase
that
way
madness
lies
well
it
recurs
to
me
when
i
let
myself
think
no
won
t
think
i
beg
of
you
don
t
question
me
i
m
not
a
hysterical
woman
there
are
times
when
a
man
feels
as
if
hysterics
might
be
a
relief
then
let
s
not
think
said
claire
tactfully
but
let
me
try
to
be
helpful
if
mrs
varian
is
coming
here
you
advise
that
varian
with
a
sheet
i
suppose
you
know
where
to
find
one
no
i
ve
never
been
upstairs
then
after
all
isn
t
a
sheet
even
more
gruesome
than
the
sight
as
it
is
at
present
how
about
a
dark
cover
very
well
the
doctor
spoke
absorbedly
uncaring
glancing
about
claire
noticed
a
folded
steamer
rug
on
the
end
of
the
big
davenport
in
the
hall
and
fetching
that
she
laid
it
lightly
over
the
still
form
now
about
betty
said
the
doctor
coming
out
of
his
brown
study
she
is
in
the
house
hiding
fear
oh
do
you
think
that
then
let
us
find
her
we
can
t
both
go
will
you
remain
here
and
meet
the
others
or
shall
i
stay
here
while
you
go
to
look
for
the
girl
claire
blackwood
pondered
either
suggestion
was
too
hard
for
her
to
accept
i
can
t
she
said
at
last
i
m
a
coward
i
suppose
i
can
t
search
this
great
empty
house
betty
and
if
she
were
in
it
she
would
surely
come
here
to
us
doctor
varian
looked
at
her
then
i
ll
go
he
said
simply
you
stay
no
claire
grasped
his
arm
i
can
t
do
that
either
oh
doctor
varian
stay
here
with
me
think
are
not
my
people
m
sympathetic
of
course
but
i
m
terrified
m
there
s
nothing
to
i
can
t
help
that
won
t
stay
here
alone
if
you
leave
me
i
shall
run
down
the
path
to
meet
then
i
ll
have
to
stay
here
very
well
mrs
blackwood
they
ll
arrive
in
a
few
moments
ll
wait
for
them
and
then
varian
again
fell
to
ruminating
and
claire
blackwood
sick
with
her
own
thoughts
said
no
word
at
last
they
heard
footsteps
and
looked
out
to
see
the
little
procession
headed
by
the
two
janet
varian
was
half
supporting
minna
but
her
help
was
not
greatly
needed
for
the
very
violence
of
minna
s
grief
and
fright
gave
her
a
sort
of
supernormal
strength
and
she
walked
uprightly
and
swiftly
where
s
frederick
she
demanded
in
a
shrill
voice
as
she
came
up
the
steps
and
where
s
betty
where
s
my
child
her
voice
rose
to
a
shriek
on
the
last
words
and
doctor
varian
took
her
by
the
arm
giving
her
his
undivided
attention
be
careful
now
minna
he
said
kindly
but
decidedly
don
t
lose
your
grip
you
ve
a
big
trouble
to
face
do
try
dear
to
meet
it
i
m
brave
enough
herbert
don
t
worry
about
that
where
s
fred
i
say
here
was
the
brief
reply
and
varian
led
her
to
her
husband
s
body
as
he
had
fully
expected
she
went
into
violent
hysterics
she
cried
she
screamed
then
her
voice
subsided
to
a
sort
of
low
dismal
wailing
only
to
break
out
afresh
with
renewed
shrieks
perhaps
it
s
better
that
she
should
do
this
than
to
control
herself
the
doctor
said
she
ll
soon
exhaust
herself
at
this
rate
and
may
in
that
way
become
more
tractable
i
wish
we
could
get
her
to
we
can
responded
his
wife
promptly
i
ll
look
after
that
give
a
look
at
eleanor
the
harassed
doctor
turned
his
attention
to
his
daughter
who
was
controlling
herself
but
who
was
trembling
piteously
good
girl
said
her
father
taking
her
in
his
arms
buck
up
nell
dear
dad
s
got
a
whole
lot
on
his
shoulders
and
my
how
it
will
help
if
you
don
t
keel
over
i
won
t
and
eleanor
tried
to
smile
claire
blackwood
approached
the
pair
doctor
varian
she
said
suppose
i
take
your
daughter
home
with
me
for
the
night
longer
if
she
ll
stay
it
might
relieve
you
and
your
wife
of
a
little
care
and
i
ll
be
good
to
her
i
promise
you
and
if
i
may
i
d
like
to
go
now
i
can
t
be
of
any
service
here
can
i
and
as
miss
eleanor
can
t
either
what
do
you
think
of
our
going
now
a
very
good
idea
mrs
blackwood
and
the
doctor
s
face
showed
grateful
appreciation
take
one
of
the
young
men
with
you
and
leave
the
other
here
to
help
we
ll
take
john
clark
claire
decided
and
ted
landon
will
i
know
be
glad
to
stand
by
the
three
departed
and
then
the
left
the
room
and
went
upstairs
minna
making
no
resistance
to
janet
s
suggestions
left
alone
with
the
dead
doctor
varian
and
young
landon
looked
at
each
other
what
does
it
all
mean
asked
the
younger
man
a
look
of
absolute
bewilderment
on
his
face
i
can
t
make
it
out
returned
the
other
slowly
but
it
s
a
pretty
awful
situation
now
the
women
are
gone
i
ll
speak
out
the
thing
that
troubles
me
most
where
s
betty
who
miss
varian
why
yes
where
is
she
she
came
for
her
camera
you
know
she
must
be
in
the
she
must
be
is
can
t
see
any
alternative
i
understand
there
s
no
way
out
of
this
house
save
down
the
path
we
no
other
then
if
the
girl
s
in
the
house
must
be
yes
and
landon
saw
the
terrible
fear
in
the
other
s
eyes
and
his
own
glance
responded
shall
we
search
the
rooms
that
must
be
done
now
i
m
not
willing
to
leave
the
body
of
my
brother
unattended
will
you
watch
by
it
while
i
run
over
the
house
or
the
other
way
about
i
ll
do
as
you
prefer
i
should
doctor
varian
if
you
give
me
a
choice
i
ll
stay
here
i
ve
never
been
in
the
house
before
and
i
don
t
know
the
rooms
however
i
want
to
be
frank
the
truth
is
i
d
rather
not
make
that
search
if
i
did
know
the
i
understand
mr
landon
and
i
don
t
blame
you
i
ve
never
been
in
the
house
before
either
i
don
t
at
all
like
the
idea
of
the
search
but
it
must
be
made
made
at
once
and
it
s
my
place
to
do
it
so
then
if
you
ll
remain
here
i
ll
go
the
ted
landon
nodded
silently
and
sat
down
to
begin
the
vigil
he
had
been
asked
to
keep
herbert
varian
went
first
upstairs
to
minna
s
room
and
opening
the
door
softly
discovered
the
widow
was
lying
quietly
on
her
bed
janet
sitting
by
placed
a
warning
forefinger
against
her
lip
and
seeing
that
the
patient
was
quiet
varian
noiselessly
closed
the
door
and
tiptoed
away
he
stood
a
moment
in
the
second
story
hall
looking
upward
at
a
closed
door
to
which
a
narrow
and
winding
staircase
would
take
him
should
he
go
up
there
search
the
two
lower
stories
first
he
looked
out
of
a
window
at
the
foot
of
the
little
stair
it
gave
west
and
afforded
no
view
of
the
sea
but
the
wild
and
inaccessible
rocks
which
he
saw
proved
to
him
finally
that
there
was
no
way
of
approach
to
this
lonely
house
save
by
that
one
and
only
path
he
had
already
climbed
he
sighed
for
this
dashed
his
last
hope
that
betty
might
have
left
the
house
on
some
errand
or
some
escapade
before
her
father
had
reached
it
with
vague
forebodings
and
a
horrible
sinking
at
his
heart
he
began
to
ascend
the
turret
stair
chapter
iv
the
search
doctor
herbert
varian
was
a
man
accustomed
to
responsibilities
more
he
was
accustomed
to
the
responsibilities
of
other
people
as
well
as
his
own
yet
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
position
in
which
he
now
found
himself
was
more
appalling
than
anything
he
had
ever
before
experienced
and
that
it
was
liable
to
grow
worse
rather
than
better
with
successive
developments
varian
had
what
has
been
called
the
leaping
mind
and
without
being
unduly
apprehensive
he
saw
trouble
ahead
such
as
he
shuddered
to
think
about
his
brother
dead
there
was
the
hysterical
widow
to
be
cared
for
and
betty
in
he
paused
his
hand
on
the
latch
of
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
stair
then
squaring
his
shoulders
he
shook
off
his
hesitation
and
opened
the
door
he
found
himself
in
a
small
turret
room
from
which
he
went
on
to
other
rooms
on
that
floor
they
were
for
the
most
part
quite
evidently
unoccupied
bedrooms
but
two
gave
signs
of
being
in
use
by
servants
varian
paid
little
heed
to
his
surroundings
but
went
rapidly
about
hunting
for
the
missing
girl
betty
he
called
softly
betty
dear
where
are
you
don
t
be
afraid
herbert
will
take
care
of
you
come
betty
come
out
of
but
there
was
no
answer
to
his
calls
he
flung
open
cupboard
doors
he
peered
into
dark
corners
and
alcoves
but
he
saw
no
trace
of
any
one
nor
heard
any
sound
two
other
tiny
staircases
led
up
to
higher
turrets
but
these
were
empty
and
search
as
he
would
he
found
no
betty
nor
any
trace
of
her
unwilling
to
waste
what
might
be
valuable
time
doctor
varian
went
downstairs
again
then
one
after
another
he
visited
all
the
rooms
on
the
second
floor
but
found
no
sign
of
his
niece
he
went
again
to
the
room
where
the
women
were
and
beckoned
his
wife
outside
minna
is
asleep
he
asked
in
a
whisper
yes
janet
replied
but
of
course
only
as
an
effect
of
that
strong
opiate
you
gave
her
she
tosses
and
moans
yes
she
is
i
dread
her
waking
what
we
to
do
with
her
and
janet
where
is
betty
i
ve
been
all
over
these
upper
floors
now
i
ll
tackle
the
rooms
downstairs
and
the
cellar
the
girl
must
be
herbert
did
you
ever
know
such
a
fearful
situation
t
you
have
yes
yes
of
course
the
authorities
must
be
called
in
don
t
think
i
haven
t
realized
that
but
first
of
all
we
must
find
or
alive
don
t
say
that
janet
clutched
at
his
arm
i
can
t
bear
any
more
poor
girl
may
have
to
brace
up
dear
i
ve
all
i
can
do
of
course
you
have
his
wife
kissed
him
tenderly
don
t
be
afraid
i
won
t
add
to
your
burdens
and
i
will
help
all
i
can
thank
heaven
that
kind
woman
took
eleanor
away
with
yes
but
i
daresay
we
ought
to
have
kept
them
all
here
there
s
crime
to
be
considered
never
mind
they
re
gone
i
m
glad
of
it
you
can
get
them
back
when
but
it
s
a
mystery
what
shall
i
do
first
i
never
felt
so
absolutely
unable
to
cope
with
a
situation
but
the
first
thing
is
to
hunt
further
for
pursuant
of
his
clearest
duty
doctor
varian
went
on
through
the
yet
unsearched
rooms
on
to
the
kitchen
and
on
down
to
the
cellar
he
made
a
hasty
but
careful
search
flinging
open
closets
cupboards
and
storerooms
and
returned
at
last
to
the
hall
where
ted
landon
sat
with
folded
arms
keeping
his
lonely
vigil
i
can
t
imagine
where
betty
can
be
and
varian
sank
wearily
into
a
chair
she
must
be
in
the
house
said
landon
wonderingly
for
there
s
no
way
out
except
down
the
path
where
we
all
there
s
a
back
door
i
i
mean
no
way
off
the
premises
yes
there
must
be
a
back
know
i
ve
never
been
in
this
house
no
well
look
here
landon
the
authorities
must
be
notified
the
local
doctor
ought
to
be
called
in
all
that
but
first
i
want
to
find
betty
suppose
i
stay
here
admit
i
m
pretty
tired
you
take
a
look
out
around
the
back
door
and
kitchen
porch
by
the
way
the
servants
will
be
coming
home
no
they
were
to
stay
out
for
the
evening
i
think
mrs
varian
but
those
people
who
went
back
to
the
village
will
of
course
tell
of
the
matter
and
soon
we
ll
have
all
kinds
of
curious
all
right
doctor
varian
i
ll
do
just
what
you
the
younger
man
went
on
his
errand
and
going
through
the
kitchen
found
the
back
porch
to
reach
it
he
had
to
unlock
the
outside
door
thus
proving
to
his
own
satisfaction
that
betty
had
not
gone
out
that
way
but
he
went
out
and
looked
about
he
saw
nothing
indicative
the
porch
was
pleasant
and
in
neat
order
a
and
a
much
novel
were
evidently
the
property
of
the
cook
or
waitress
and
an
old
cap
on
a
nail
was
doubtless
the
butler
s
he
took
pains
to
ascertain
that
there
was
no
path
or
road
that
led
down
to
the
gate
but
the
path
that
also
went
from
the
front
door
and
which
he
had
been
on
when
betty
returned
to
the
house
he
had
seen
her
enter
the
house
had
seen
her
father
go
in
a
few
moments
later
now
where
was
the
girl
back
to
the
kitchen
landon
went
and
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
he
noticed
a
yellow
cushion
it
was
a
satin
covered
embroidered
affair
probably
he
thought
a
sofa
cushion
or
hammock
pillow
but
it
seemed
too
elaborate
for
a
servant
s
cushion
surely
it
belonged
to
the
family
the
kitchen
was
in
tidy
order
save
for
a
tray
of
used
glasses
and
empty
plates
which
was
on
a
table
landon
picked
up
the
pillow
then
on
second
thoughts
laid
it
back
where
he
had
found
it
it
might
be
evidence
an
open
door
showed
the
cellar
stairs
conquering
a
strong
disinclination
landon
went
down
the
cellar
was
large
and
seemed
to
have
various
rooms
and
bins
and
some
locked
cupboards
but
there
was
nothing
sinister
the
rooms
were
for
the
most
part
fairly
light
and
the
air
was
good
remembering
that
doctor
varian
had
already
searched
down
there
for
betty
landon
merely
went
over
the
same
ground
and
returned
with
the
news
of
his
unsuccessful
search
no
way
out
queried
the
doctor
briefly
none
except
by
passing
the
very
spot
where
we
all
were
when
betty
ran
back
to
the
where
is
she
landon
the
two
men
stared
at
each
other
both
absolutely
at
a
loss
to
answer
the
question
well
and
varian
pulled
himself
together
this
won
t
do
it
s
a
case
for
the
police
shall
we
get
at
them
i
don
t
know
anything
about
the
police
but
if
you
telephone
the
inn
or
the
clubhouse
they
ll
tell
you
the
local
doctor
is
merritt
know
him
but
he
couldn
t
do
anything
why
call
him
when
you
re
here
it
s
customary
i
think
you
call
merritt
will
you
and
then
i
ll
speak
to
the
the
telephoning
was
just
about
completed
when
a
fearful
scream
from
upstairs
announced
the
fact
that
minna
varian
had
awakened
from
her
opiate
sleep
and
had
returned
to
a
realization
of
her
troubles
slowly
doctor
varian
rose
and
went
up
the
stairs
he
entered
the
bedroom
to
find
minna
sitting
up
in
bed
and
struggling
to
get
up
while
janet
urged
her
to
lie
still
lie
still
she
screamed
i
will
not
come
here
herbert
tell
me
is
my
child
why
is
betty
not
here
is
she
dead
too
tell
me
i
say
yes
minna
varian
returned
quietly
i
will
tell
you
all
i
can
i
do
not
know
where
betty
is
but
we
ve
no
reason
to
think
she
is
then
why
doesn
t
she
come
to
me
why
doesn
t
fred
come
oh
is
dead
t
he
and
then
the
poor
woman
went
into
violent
hysterics
now
shrieking
like
a
maniac
and
now
moaning
piteously
like
some
hurt
animal
the
first
thing
to
do
said
doctor
varian
decidedly
is
to
get
a
nurse
for
no
demurred
his
wife
not
tonight
anyway
i
ll
take
care
of
her
and
there
will
be
some
maid
servant
who
can
help
me
there
was
a
nice
looking
waitress
among
those
who
went
off
this
the
servants
will
surely
return
as
soon
as
they
hear
the
news
varian
said
and
then
he
gave
all
his
attention
to
calming
his
patient
again
he
placed
her
under
the
influence
of
a
powerful
opiate
and
by
the
time
she
was
unconscious
the
local
doctor
had
come
varian
went
down
to
find
doctor
merritt
examining
the
body
of
his
brother
the
two
medical
men
met
courteously
the
local
doctor
assuming
an
important
air
principally
because
he
considered
the
other
his
superior
terrible
thing
doctor
varian
merritt
said
death
practically
practically
returned
the
other
may
have
lived
a
few
moments
but
unconscious
at
once
you
know
the
sheriff
yes
potter
he
ll
be
along
soon
he
s
a
shrewd
one
heavens
who
did
this
thing
doctor
merritt
s
formality
gave
way
before
his
irrepressible
curiosity
he
looked
from
doctor
varian
to
ted
landon
and
back
again
with
an
exasperated
air
of
resentment
at
being
told
so
little
we
don
t
know
doctor
merritt
landon
said
as
the
other
doctor
said
nothing
we
ve
no
no
idea
a
man
shot
and
killed
in
this
lonely
isolated
house
and
you
don
t
know
who
did
it
what
do
you
mean
in
a
few
words
varian
detailed
the
circumstances
and
added
we
don
t
know
where
miss
varian
disappeared
then
she
must
have
shot
her
oh
no
interrupted
landon
don
t
say
such
an
absurd
thing
what
else
is
there
to
say
demanded
merritt
you
say
there
was
nobody
in
the
house
but
those
two
people
now
one
is
here
dead
and
the
other
is
missing
what
else
can
be
said
don
t
accuse
a
defenseless
girl
advised
varian
betty
must
be
found
of
course
but
i
don
t
for
a
minute
believe
she
shot
her
where
s
the
gun
asked
doctor
merritt
hasn
t
been
found
returned
varian
briefly
mrs
varian
my
brother
s
wife
is
hysterical
i
ve
been
obliged
to
quiet
her
by
opiates
doctor
merritt
this
is
by
no
means
a
simple
case
i
hope
your
sheriff
is
a
man
of
brains
and
experience
it
s
going
to
call
for
wise
and
competent
potter
is
experienced
enough
been
sheriff
for
years
but
as
to
brains
he
isn
t
overburdened
with
them
still
he
s
got
good
horse
one
of
the
best
things
to
have
commented
varian
now
i
don
t
know
that
we
need
keep
mr
landon
here
any
longer
what
do
you
think
i
don
t
know
said
merritt
thoughtfully
he
was
here
at
the
time
of
yes
but
so
were
several
others
and
they
ve
gone
away
as
you
like
mr
landon
but
i
don
t
think
you
need
stay
unless
you
i
do
wish
ted
landon
said
i
may
be
of
use
somehow
and
too
i
m
deeply
interested
i
want
to
see
what
the
sheriff
thinks
about
it
and
too
i
want
to
try
to
find
or
help
to
find
miss
betty
must
be
found
said
varian
as
if
suddenly
reminded
of
the
fact
i
am
so
distracted
between
the
shock
of
my
brother
s
death
and
the
anxiety
regarding
his
wife
s
condition
that
for
the
moment
i
almost
forgot
betty
that
child
must
be
hiding
somewhere
she
must
have
been
frightened
in
some
fearful
way
and
either
fainted
or
run
away
and
hid
out
in
the
grounds
somewhere
i
m
positive
she
isn
t
in
the
she
couldn
t
have
gone
out
the
back
door
said
landon
it
was
locked
when
i
went
to
she
couldn
t
have
gone
out
at
the
front
door
or
we
should
have
seen
her
varian
added
she
stepped
out
of
a
window
are
you
assuming
some
intruder
asked
merritt
wonderingly
i
m
not
assuming
anything
returned
varian
a
little
crisply
for
his
nerves
were
on
edge
but
betty
varian
must
be
found
duty
is
to
the
living
as
well
as
to
the
he
glanced
at
his
brother
s
body
and
his
face
expressed
a
mute
promise
to
care
for
that
brother
s
child
but
how
are
you
going
to
find
her
asked
landon
we
saw
miss
varian
enter
this
therefore
she
is
still
in
it
in
the
grounds
said
varian
positively
it
can
t
be
otherwise
i
shall
hunt
out
of
doors
first
before
it
grows
dusk
then
we
can
hunt
the
house
you
have
hunted
the
yes
but
it
must
be
hunted
more
thoroughly
why
betty
s
body
must
be
somewhere
and
must
be
doctor
merritt
listened
dumfounded
here
was
mystery
indeed
mr
varian
dead
weapon
found
and
his
daughter
missing
what
could
be
the
explanation
the
hunt
out
of
doors
for
betty
resulted
in
nothing
at
all
there
was
no
kitchen
garden
merely
a
drying
plot
and
a
small
patch
of
back
yard
mostly
stones
and
hard
ground
this
was
surrounded
by
dwarfed
and
stunted
pine
trees
which
not
only
afforded
no
hiding
place
but
shut
off
no
possible
nook
or
cranny
where
betty
could
be
hidden
the
whole
tableland
was
exposed
to
view
from
all
parts
of
it
and
it
was
clear
to
be
seen
that
betty
varian
could
not
be
hiding
out
of
doors
and
since
she
could
not
have
left
the
premises
save
by
the
road
where
the
picnic
party
was
congregated
there
was
no
supposition
but
that
she
was
still
in
the
house
can
you
form
any
theory
doctor
varian
landon
asked
him
no
i
can
t
can
you
only
the
obvious
one
miss
varian
killed
her
father
and
then
hid
but
where
mind
you
i
don
t
for
a
moment
admit
she
killed
her
father
that
s
too
ridiculous
but
whoever
killed
him
may
also
have
killed
her
it
is
her
body
i
think
we
are
more
likely
to
how
then
did
the
assassin
get
away
i
don
t
know
i
m
not
prepared
to
say
there
s
no
way
out
of
this
but
i
know
that
to
be
the
fact
there
comes
the
sheriff
doctor
varian
that
s
they
went
into
the
house
again
and
found
the
sheriff
and
another
man
with
him
merritt
made
the
necessary
introductions
and
doctor
varian
looked
at
potter
the
strangest
case
you
ve
ever
had
he
informed
him
and
the
most
important
how
do
you
propose
to
handle
it
like
i
do
all
the
others
by
using
my
yes
i
know
but
i
mean
what
help
do
you
expect
to
have
dunno
s
i
ll
need
any
yet
haven
t
got
the
principal
facts
dead
man
s
your
brother
ain
t
he
shot
dead
and
no
weapon
around
criminal
unknown
now
about
this
young
lady
daughter
where
is
she
i
don
t
know
i
hope
you
can
find
and
then
doctor
varian
told
in
his
straightforward
way
of
his
search
for
the
girl
mighty
curious
vouchsafed
the
sheriff
with
an
air
of
one
stating
a
new
idea
the
girl
and
her
father
on
good
terms
yes
of
course
varian
answered
but
his
slight
hesitation
made
the
sheriff
eye
him
keenly
we
want
the
truth
you
know
he
said
thoughtfully
if
them
two
wasn
t
on
good
terms
you
might
as
well
say
so
cause
it
ll
come
out
sooner
or
but
they
were
far
as
i
oh
well
all
right
i
can
t
think
yet
the
girl
shot
her
father
i
won
t
think
that
i
have
to
but
good
land
man
you
say
you
ve
looked
all
over
the
house
s
the
murderer
then
suicide
laconically
said
the
man
who
had
come
with
the
sheriff
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
spoken
he
was
a
quiet
insignificant
chap
but
his
eyes
were
keen
and
his
whole
face
alert
couldn
t
be
bill
said
the
sheriff
with
no
weapon
might
a
been
removed
the
other
said
in
his
brief
way
by
whom
asked
doctor
varian
by
whoever
came
here
first
bill
returned
looking
at
him
i
came
here
first
varian
stated
do
you
mean
i
removed
the
weapon
have
to
look
at
all
sides
you
well
i
didn
t
but
i
won
t
take
time
now
to
enlarge
on
that
plain
statement
i
ll
be
here
you
can
question
me
when
and
as
often
as
you
like
now
mr
potter
what
are
you
going
to
do
first
well
seems
to
me
there
s
no
more
to
be
done
with
mr
varian
s
body
you
two
doctors
have
examined
it
you
know
all
about
the
wound
that
killed
him
bill
here
has
jotted
down
all
the
details
of
its
position
and
all
that
now
i
think
you
can
call
in
the
undertakers
and
have
the
body
taken
away
or
kept
here
till
the
funeral
you
the
funeral
exclaimed
doctor
varian
realizing
a
further
responsibility
for
his
laden
shoulders
i
suppose
i
d
better
arrange
about
that
for
my
will
not
be
able
to
do
jest
s
you
like
said
potter
next
i
ll
investigate
for
myself
the
absence
of
this
girl
a
mysterious
disappearance
is
as
serious
a
matter
as
a
mysterious
death
more
that
s
true
agreed
varian
i
hope
you
ll
be
able
to
find
my
niece
for
she
must
be
easy
enough
to
say
she
must
be
found
trick
is
to
find
have
you
any
theory
of
the
crime
mr
potter
landon
asked
theory
no
i
don
t
deal
in
theories
i
may
say
it
looks
to
me
like
the
girl
may
have
shot
her
father
but
it
only
looks
that
way
because
there
s
no
other
way
so
far
for
it
to
look
you
can
t
suspect
a
criminal
that
you
ain
t
had
any
hint
of
can
you
if
anybody
now
turns
up
who
s
seen
a
man
prowling
seen
any
mysterious
person
or
if
any
servant
is
found
who
say
didn
t
go
to
the
circus
but
hung
behind
but
if
there
s
any
such
they
or
he
must
be
in
the
house
now
bill
said
quietly
let
s
go
and
the
two
started
from
the
room
and
landon
after
a
glance
at
doctor
varian
followed
them
i
don
t
see
landon
said
to
potter
as
they
went
to
the
kitchen
why
you
folks
in
authority
always
seem
to
think
it
necessary
to
take
an
antagonistic
attitude
toward
the
people
who
are
representing
the
dead
man
you
act
toward
doctor
varian
as
if
you
more
than
half
suspected
he
had
a
hand
in
the
crime
himself
not
that
my
boy
and
potter
looked
at
him
gravely
but
that
doctor
brother
knows
more
than
he
s
that
s
not
so
i
know
i
came
up
here
to
the
house
with
him
i
was
with
him
when
he
found
his
brother
s
oh
you
were
why
didn
t
you
say
so
you
didn
t
ask
me
no
i
don
t
know
anything
more
i
ve
nothing
to
tell
that
can
throw
any
possible
light
but
i
do
know
that
doctor
varian
had
no
hand
in
it
and
knows
no
more
about
it
than
i
good
land
i
don
t
mean
that
he
killed
his
brother
know
better
than
that
but
he
wasn
t
frank
about
the
relations
between
the
girl
and
her
father
do
you
know
that
they
were
all
right
friendly
i
mean
so
far
as
i
know
they
were
but
i
never
met
them
until
today
i
can
only
say
that
they
acted
like
any
normal
usual
father
and
oh
well
it
doesn
t
matter
it
ll
all
come
out
sort
of
thing
now
to
find
the
chapter
v
the
yellow
pillow
what
s
this
pillow
doing
here
the
sheriff
asked
as
he
picked
up
the
yellow
satin
cushion
this
looks
to
me
like
a
parlor
i
thought
it
was
strange
too
returned
landon
but
i
can
t
see
any
clue
in
it
can
you
anything
unusual
may
prove
a
clue
said
potter
sententiously
you
never
saw
this
pillow
before
mr
no
but
i
m
not
familiar
with
the
house
at
all
maybe
it
s
a
discarded
one
handed
down
to
the
servants
doesn
t
look
so
it
s
fresh
and
new
and
very
lay
it
aside
and
come
on
growled
bill
dunn
who
was
alertly
looking
about
the
kitchen
you
can
ask
the
family
about
that
later
let
s
go
down
to
the
cellar
they
went
landon
following
he
had
a
notion
that
he
might
help
the
family
s
interests
by
keeping
at
the
heels
of
these
detectives
but
the
most
careful
search
revealed
nothing
of
importance
to
their
quest
until
potter
said
suddenly
what
s
this
a
well
it
sure
is
and
bill
dunn
peered
over
an
old
well
curb
and
looked
down
a
well
in
a
cellar
how
queer
exclaimed
landon
i
never
heard
of
such
a
uncommon
but
i
ve
known
of
em
said
bill
looks
promising
eh
potter
considered
it
may
mean
something
he
said
thoughtfully
we
ll
have
to
sound
it
sound
it
nothin
said
the
executive
bill
i
ll
go
how
potter
asked
him
there
s
no
bucket
it
s
probably
a
dried
up
prob
ly
and
bill
nodded
he
already
had
one
foot
over
the
broken
old
well
curb
wait
for
heaven
s
sake
cried
landon
don
t
jump
down
you
must
have
a
got
one
and
bill
drew
a
small
flashlight
from
his
pocket
with
the
agility
of
a
monkey
he
clambered
down
the
side
of
the
old
well
the
stones
were
large
and
not
smoothly
fitted
so
that
he
had
little
trouble
in
gaining
and
keeping
his
foothold
the
others
watched
him
as
he
descended
and
at
last
reached
the
bottom
nothing
at
all
he
called
up
i
m
coming
just
an
old
dried
up
well
he
reported
as
he
reached
them
again
must
a
dried
up
long
ago
no
water
in
it
for
years
most
likely
but
there
s
nothin
else
down
there
neither
no
body
nor
no
clues
of
any
sort
whatever
became
of
that
girl
she
ain
t
down
that
all
parts
of
the
cellar
were
subjected
to
the
same
thorough
search
landon
was
amazed
at
the
quickness
and
efficiency
shown
by
these
men
whom
he
had
thought
rather
stupid
at
first
cupboards
were
poked
into
to
their
furthest
corners
bins
were
raked
boxes
opened
and
bill
even
climbed
up
to
scan
a
swinging
shelf
that
hung
above
his
head
how
about
secret
passages
potter
asked
when
they
had
exhausted
all
obvious
hiding
places
i
been
thinkin
about
that
bill
returned
musingly
but
so
far
i
can
t
see
where
there
could
be
any
this
isn
t
the
sort
of
house
that
has
em
either
it
s
straightforward
architecture
s
what
it
is
what
do
you
mean
by
that
asked
landon
interested
in
this
strange
man
who
looked
so
ignorant
yet
was
in
some
ways
so
well
informed
well
you
see
there
s
no
unexpected
juts
or
jambs
everything
s
mostly
you
can
see
where
the
rooms
above
are
can
see
where
the
closets
and
stairs
fit
in
and
all
that
there
s
no
concealed
territory
like
real
chance
for
a
secret
passage
least
not
so
far
s
i
that
s
right
agreed
potter
bill
s
the
man
when
it
comes
to
architecture
and
building
plans
well
s
get
along
upstairs
going
through
the
kitchen
again
potter
picked
up
the
yellow
pillow
and
took
it
along
with
him
quite
evidently
it
belonged
to
a
sofa
in
the
large
square
front
hall
the
upholstery
fabric
was
the
same
and
there
was
a
corresponding
pillow
already
at
one
end
of
the
sofa
queer
thing
potter
said
how
d
that
fine
cushion
get
on
the
kitchen
floor
it
is
queer
landon
assented
but
i
can
t
see
any
meaning
in
it
can
you
not
yet
returned
potter
now
doctor
varian
and
he
turned
to
the
physician
who
sat
with
bowed
head
beside
his
brother
s
body
i
dessay
the
undertakers
ll
be
coming
along
soon
you
see
them
and
make
plans
for
the
funeral
while
bill
and
i
go
on
over
this
house
then
we
ll
have
to
see
the
rest
of
the
people
who
were
around
at
the
time
of
not
mrs
frederick
varian
said
herbert
you
can
t
see
her
i
forbid
that
as
her
well
we
ll
see
your
wife
first
and
then
we
ll
have
to
see
the
folks
that
went
back
to
the
village
and
there
s
the
servants
to
be
but
the
careful
and
exhaustive
search
of
the
two
inquiry
agents
failed
to
disclose
any
sign
of
the
missing
betty
varian
or
any
clue
to
her
whereabouts
they
went
over
the
whole
house
even
into
the
bedroom
of
the
widow
deep
artificial
sleep
made
this
possible
this
was
the
last
room
they
visited
and
as
they
tiptoed
out
bill
said
never
saw
such
a
case
no
clue
anywhere
not
even
mysterious
circumstances
everything
just
as
natural
and
commonplace
as
it
can
there
s
the
yellow
pillow
suggested
potter
i
know
that
may
have
some
simple
explanation
took
it
out
to
clean
it
then
bill
there
s
got
to
be
a
secret
passage
there
s
just
got
well
there
ain
t
tomorrow
i
ll
sound
the
walls
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
ve
measured
and
estimated
and
i
vow
there
ain
t
no
space
unaccounted
for
in
this
whole
house
but
there
s
a
lot
of
questionin
yet
to
be
done
i
ll
say
there
is
by
this
time
some
of
the
servants
had
heard
of
the
affair
and
had
returned
potter
and
bill
dunn
went
to
the
kitchen
to
see
them
and
found
kelly
the
butler
and
hannah
the
cook
in
a
scared
nervous
state
do
tell
us
sir
all
about
it
kelly
begged
his
hard
face
drawn
with
sympathy
the
it
s
true
kelly
your
master
is
dead
he
was
killed
and
we
are
investigating
what
can
you
tell
us
do
you
know
of
anybody
who
had
it
in
for
mr
varian
oh
no
sir
i
m
sure
he
hadn
t
an
enemy
in
the
oh
no
you
can
t
be
sure
of
that
my
man
but
tell
me
of
the
circumstances
when
you
all
went
away
this
afternoon
there
was
no
sign
of
disturbance
anything
unusual
oh
no
sir
everything
was
pleasant
and
proper
i
had
packed
the
luncheon
for
the
picnic
hannah
here
made
the
sandwiches
and
i
filled
the
coffee
thermos
and
all
such
things
the
baskets
were
all
ready
and
the
family
expected
to
start
on
the
picnic
almost
as
soon
as
we
went
off
i
offered
to
stay
behind
and
help
mrs
varian
but
she
was
so
kind
as
to
say
i
needn
t
do
that
so
we
all
all
at
once
yes
you
went
down
the
path
that
leads
from
the
front
door
there
s
no
other
way
it
branches
around
to
the
kitchen
entrance
up
here
but
there
s
no
other
way
off
the
not
even
for
a
burglar
or
robber
no
sir
i
don
t
believe
even
a
monkey
could
scramble
up
the
cliff
and
i
know
a
man
couldn
t
you
see
it
overhangs
and
it
s
but
coming
from
the
other
direction
village
from
that
way
everybody
has
to
pass
through
the
lodge
gate
the
lodge
you
know
s
the
garage
as
well
there
s
a
gate
yes
i
well
through
that
gate
is
the
only
way
to
get
to
this
but
all
the
picnic
party
were
waiting
in
full
view
of
that
gate
and
in
full
view
of
the
house
yet
you
needn
t
say
somebody
got
in
nobody
could
do
i
don
t
say
it
but
i
m
looking
out
for
some
such
person
if
not
we
must
what
sir
that
miss
varian
shot
her
father
and
then
some
yet
undiscovered
place
killed
herself
or
still
alive
in
miss
betty
kill
her
father
exclaimed
hannah
the
cook
speaking
to
the
sheriff
for
the
first
time
no
she
never
did
that
yet
there
was
ill
feeling
between
them
potter
returned
quickly
that
there
was
not
a
more
loving
father
and
child
i
never
met
up
with
bless
her
pretty
face
to
dare
accuse
darlin
miss
betty
of
such
a
thing
i
say
now
mister
man
you
better
be
careful
how
you
say
such
lies
around
here
you
know
you
ve
nothin
to
go
on
but
your
own
black
thoughts
you
know
you
don
t
know
who
killed
the
master
and
you
re
too
dumb
to
find
out
and
so
you
pick
on
that
poor
dear
angel
child
who
ain
t
here
to
speak
up
for
herself
where
is
she
then
where
s
miss
betty
where
is
she
belike
in
some
hidin
place
scared
into
fits
because
of
seein
her
father
shot
or
maybe
stunned
and
unconscious
herself
deed
bein
done
by
the
same
villyun
what
did
for
the
master
oh
sakes
it
s
bad
enough
without
your
makin
it
worse
callin
my
darlin
girl
a
murderer
where
s
mrs
varian
what
does
she
say
she
s
asleep
the
doctor
had
to
quiet
her
she
was
in
raving
ay
she
would
be
poor
lady
she
ll
be
no
help
in
this
awful
thing
and
sir
another
thing
the
waitress
and
the
chambermaid
they
re
sisters
agnes
and
lena
they
say
they
re
not
coming
back
here
nothing
would
induce
them
to
step
foot
in
this
house
again
they
say
they
bid
me
send
em
their
things
nonsense
they
ll
have
to
come
this
from
bill
tell
me
where
they
are
i
ll
bring
them
no
they
won
t
come
they
re
going
down
to
boston
they
mustn
t
be
allowed
to
do
that
they
ve
gone
by
now
and
hannah
looked
unconcerned
but
never
you
mind
they
know
nothin
of
this
matter
they
re
two
young
scared
girls
and
they
d
be
no
good
to
you
nor
anyone
else
they
know
nothin
to
tell
and
they
d
have
worse
hysterics
than
mrs
varian
if
you
tried
to
bring
em
back
to
this
you
won
t
desert
mrs
varian
will
you
hannah
asked
potter
well
i
ll
be
leavin
in
the
mornin
and
the
cook
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
couldn
t
be
expected
to
stay
in
such
a
no
of
course
you
couldn
t
exclaimed
potter
angrily
you
don
t
care
that
poor
mrs
varian
is
in
deep
trouble
and
sorrow
you
don
t
care
that
there
ll
be
nobody
to
cook
for
her
and
her
brother
s
family
you
ve
no
sense
of
common
humanity
sympathy
for
grief
no
heart
in
your
stupid
old
body
i
might
stay
on
for
a
time
sir
they
made
it
worth
my
oh
greed
might
keep
you
here
kelly
what
about
you
are
you
going
to
desert
this
stricken
household
i
ll
stay
for
a
time
sir
the
butler
said
quite
evidently
ill
at
ease
now
you
mustn
t
blame
us
mr
potter
i
do
blame
you
i
know
how
you
feel
about
a
house
where
there
s
a
mystery
but
also
you
ought
to
be
glad
to
do
whatever
you
can
to
help
and
nothing
could
help
poor
mrs
varian
so
much
as
to
have
some
of
her
servants
faithful
to
her
also
i
m
pretty
sure
i
may
promise
you
extra
pay
i
know
that
will
hold
you
when
nothing
else
and
now
bill
dunn
put
in
you
d
better
fix
up
a
meal
for
those
who
want
it
they
had
no
picnic
supper
you
see
and
there
are
the
guests
to
be
considered
as
well
as
your
mrs
speakin
one
word
for
them
and
two
for
yourself
i
m
thinkin
hannah
sniffed
as
she
began
to
tie
on
her
apron
well
mr
potter
you
ll
be
welcome
to
a
good
meal
i
m
one
moment
hannah
said
bill
when
you
left
here
today
was
there
a
sofa
pillow
out
here
in
the
kitchen
a
sofy
pillow
there
was
not
why
should
such
a
thing
be
a
yellow
satin
one
off
the
hall
sofy
no
sir
it
never
was
in
my
kitchen
at
what
do
you
know
about
it
dunn
turned
to
the
butler
when
did
you
last
see
the
sofa
pillows
on
the
hall
sofa
kelly
stared
i
saw
them
this
morning
sir
and
i
saw
them
this
afternoon
i
set
the
picnic
baskets
out
i
didn
how
did
you
happen
to
notice
the
pillows
kelly
bill
watched
him
closely
why
i
didn
t
exactly
notice
them
if
they
hadn
t
been
in
place
i
should
have
noticed
that
s
right
dunn
gave
a
satisfied
nod
the
pillow
episode
seemed
important
to
him
though
he
could
get
no
meaning
to
it
as
yet
now
kelly
tell
me
the
truth
when
you
ve
been
around
in
the
dining
room
or
the
living
rooms
haven
t
you
heard
conversations
between
miss
varian
and
her
father
that
showed
some
friction
between
the
two
oh
now
sir
miss
betty
s
a
saucy
i
don
t
mean
gay
chaff
mean
real
downright
quarreling
did
you
ever
hear
any
of
that
tell
me
the
truth
kelly
you
ll
serve
no
good
purpose
by
trying
to
shield
either
of
well
then
yes
sir
i
did
often
but
not
to
say
exactly
quarreling
like
why
do
you
say
that
kelly
they
do
quarrel
the
time
they
quarrel
you
know
this
astonishing
speech
was
from
the
lips
of
minna
varian
who
suddenly
appeared
in
the
kitchen
doorway
she
was
smiling
a
little
she
looked
tired
and
wan
but
she
was
in
no
way
excited
or
hysterical
she
wore
a
trailing
blue
wrapper
and
her
hair
was
falling
from
its
combs
and
hairpins
mrs
varian
exclaimed
potter
springing
to
her
side
why
are
you
here
i
heard
voices
and
i
wondered
who
was
down
here
where
are
my
people
who
are
you
two
strange
men
there
there
said
hannah
advancing
and
putting
an
arm
round
her
mistress
let
me
take
you
back
to
your
room
come
just
a
minute
and
potter
looked
keenly
at
the
lady
say
that
again
mrs
varian
your
daughter
quarrels
with
her
father
often
all
the
time
minna
varian
laughed
i
have
to
make
peace
between
them
morning
noon
and
night
oh
why
do
they
do
it
fred
is
so
dear
and
sweet
to
me
he
will
scold
betty
for
the
least
trifle
and
betty
never
differs
from
me
in
her
opinions
but
she
is
antagonistic
to
her
father
always
can
you
explain
it
mrs
varian
s
large
gray
eyes
stared
at
potter
and
then
turned
to
bill
dunn
it
was
clear
to
be
seen
that
she
was
still
partly
under
the
influence
of
the
opiate
effects
and
that
her
memory
of
the
recent
tragedy
was
utterly
obliterated
take
her
to
her
room
potter
said
quickly
to
hannah
if
she
comes
to
down
here
there
ll
be
a
fearful
scene
how
did
she
get
away
there
was
nobody
in
my
room
minna
said
overhearing
who
should
be
there
i
m
not
ill
i
woke
up
from
a
nap
and
i
heard
talking
room
is
right
above
this
so
i
came
down
where
s
miss
betty
hannah
kelly
what
are
you
doing
i
m
about
to
get
supper
madam
kelly
s
glance
rested
kindly
on
the
pathetic
figure
minna
varian
looked
small
and
frail
and
her
white
face
and
vacant
staring
eyes
seemed
to
add
to
the
mystery
of
the
whole
affair
come
now
mrs
varian
come
along
of
minna
where
are
you
janet
s
frightened
voice
broke
in
upon
them
merciful
powers
however
did
she
get
down
here
help
me
get
her
back
hannah
no
wait
i
ll
call
doctor
but
herbert
varian
was
already
entering
the
kitchen
and
between
them
minna
was
safely
convoyed
back
to
her
room
well
we
re
getting
at
the
truth
said
potter
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
as
he
glanced
at
dunn
lord
knows
i
m
sorry
for
that
poor
woman
but
they
say
children
and
fools
speak
the
truth
and
so
though
she
isn
t
herself
mentally
she
told
the
truth
about
miss
varian
and
her
father
being
oh
she
didn
t
hannah
moaned
wiping
her
eyes
on
her
apron
i
tell
you
it
wasn
t
as
bad
as
mrs
varian
makes
yes
it
was
said
kelly
slowly
you
ve
no
way
of
knowing
hannah
you
re
always
in
the
kitchen
but
i
m
about
the
house
all
the
time
and
i
hear
lots
of
talk
and
it
s
just
as
mrs
varian
said
miss
betty
and
her
father
never
agree
they
scrap
at
the
least
hint
of
a
chance
and
though
sometimes
they
re
terribly
affectionate
and
loving
yet
at
other
times
they
quarrel
like
that
s
enough
kelly
now
keep
quiet
about
this
even
if
miss
varian
and
her
father
were
not
always
friendly
it
may
not
mean
anything
serious
and
it
may
make
trouble
for
the
young
lady
if
such
reports
get
you
expect
to
find
miss
betty
then
find
her
of
course
you
say
yourself
there
s
only
one
way
out
of
these
premises
we
know
she
didn
t
go
out
that
way
so
she
must
be
here
there
must
be
places
we
haven
t
yet
discovered
where
she
is
hiding
has
been
it
s
a
fearful
situation
broke
out
dunn
that
girl
may
be
gagged
and
some
secret
you
say
there
are
none
i
do
say
i
don
t
see
how
there
can
be
any
but
good
lord
potter
the
girl
must
be
somewhere
or
alive
an
attractive
supper
largely
consisting
of
the
delicacies
intended
for
the
picnic
and
supplemented
by
some
hot
viands
was
soon
in
readiness
hannah
was
deputed
to
sit
beside
mrs
varian
now
sleeping
again
and
the
others
including
the
detectives
gathered
round
the
table
i
d
like
the
sum
of
your
findings
so
far
doctor
varian
said
raising
weary
eyes
to
potter
s
face
pretty
slim
doctor
the
sheriff
responded
but
i
want
to
say
right
now
that
i
ve
got
to
do
my
duty
as
i
see
it
much
as
i
d
like
to
spare
the
feelings
of
you
people
and
all
that
i
ve
got
to
forge
ahead
and
discover
anything
i
of
course
you
have
mr
potter
don
t
think
i
d
put
a
straw
in
the
way
of
truth
or
justice
but
granting
that
you
may
speak
with
all
plainness
where
do
you
come
out
only
to
the
inevitable
conclusion
that
miss
varian
killed
her
father
and
then
killed
herself
and
her
body
will
yet
be
now
potter
dunn
said
slowly
don
t
go
too
fast
that
is
one
theory
to
be
sure
but
it
s
only
a
theory
you
ve
nothing
to
back
it
up
s
no
there
s
negative
evidence
bill
nobody
else
could
get
up
here
to
do
that
shooting
or
if
he
did
he
couldn
t
get
away
again
say
for
a
minute
that
some
intruder
might
have
been
concealed
in
the
house
say
he
shot
mr
varian
how
d
he
get
out
of
here
without
being
seen
and
how
did
he
do
for
the
girl
that
s
all
so
bill
said
doggedly
but
it
ain
t
enough
to
prove
even
to
indicate
that
miss
varian
did
the
shooting
where
d
she
get
a
pistol
pshaw
that
s
a
foolish
question
if
she
had
nerve
and
ingenuity
enough
to
shoot
she
had
enough
to
provide
the
betty
never
did
such
things
said
janet
varian
with
spirit
that
girl
did
sometimes
have
words
with
her
father
s
a
mere
nothing
own
daughter
does
that
betty
varian
is
a
loving
affectionate
daughter
and
she
no
more
killed
her
father
than
i
did
small
use
in
asserting
things
you
can
t
prove
said
potter
devoting
himself
to
his
supper
next
thing
for
me
to
do
s
to
see
those
other
people
ones
that
were
here
this
all
right
said
doctor
varian
but
what
do
you
hope
to
learn
from
them
they
don
t
know
as
much
as
we
do
i
was
first
on
the
spot
young
landon
who
s
gone
home
was
here
with
me
and
those
others
stayed
down
on
the
path
waiting
for
us
see
them
by
all
means
but
i
doubt
their
helpfulness
now
aside
from
that
and
granting
you
get
no
new
evidence
what
s
to
be
done
i
think
potter
said
thoughtfully
you
d
better
offer
a
reward
for
any
news
of
miss
varian
it
s
not
likely
to
bring
results
it
ought
to
be
done
i
chapter
vi
the
varian
pearls
when
bill
dunn
went
up
on
the
porch
of
mrs
blackwood
s
bungalow
that
evening
he
found
a
group
of
neighbors
there
and
was
not
at
all
surprised
that
they
were
discussing
the
dreadful
affair
of
headland
house
claire
blackwood
greeted
the
caller
courteously
and
asked
him
to
go
inside
the
house
with
her
let
us
all
go
said
rodney
granniss
i
want
to
learn
all
about
this
case
and
we
re
entitled
to
come
on
everybody
dunn
invited
i
want
to
ask
a
lot
of
questions
and
who
knows
where
i
may
get
the
best
and
most
unexpected
granniss
and
lawrence
north
with
ted
landon
and
john
clark
who
had
been
up
on
the
headland
in
the
afternoon
were
the
men
and
mrs
blackwood
and
her
young
guest
eleanor
varian
were
the
only
women
present
yet
dunn
seemed
well
satisfied
as
he
looked
over
the
group
fine
he
said
all
the
witnesses
i
wanted
and
all
here
we
didn
t
witness
anything
offered
john
clark
who
was
apparently
by
no
means
desirous
of
taking
part
in
the
colloquy
and
as
i
ve
an
engagement
can
t
you
question
me
first
and
let
me
go
sure
i
can
returned
dunn
whose
easy
manners
were
not
at
all
curbed
by
the
more
formal
attitude
of
those
about
him
just
tell
the
story
in
your
own
way
clark
resented
the
familiar
speech
but
said
nothing
to
that
effect
there
s
little
to
tell
he
began
i
d
never
been
up
to
headland
house
before
and
of
course
i
d
never
before
met
the
varians
of
them
i
went
on
mrs
blackwood
s
invitation
and
after
meeting
the
family
and
their
guests
on
the
veranda
we
all
started
for
a
picnic
we
had
reached
a
point
half
way
down
the
steep
path
from
the
house
when
miss
betty
varian
said
she
had
forgotten
her
camera
she
returned
to
the
house
for
it
and
we
waited
she
was
gone
so
long
that
we
wondered
then
her
father
went
to
hurry
her
up
he
too
was
gone
a
long
time
and
then
doctor
varian
and
ted
landon
went
after
him
that
s
my
story
landon
can
tell
you
the
i
know
the
rest
said
dunn
shortly
i
don
t
see
mr
clark
that
you
need
remain
your
evidence
is
merely
that
of
all
the
party
who
stayed
behind
while
the
others
went
up
to
the
yes
said
clark
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
making
his
adieux
he
went
away
have
you
formed
any
theory
of
the
crime
mr
dunn
asked
lawrence
north
who
was
consumed
with
impatient
curiosity
during
the
already
known
testimony
of
clark
not
a
definite
one
dunn
replied
seeming
by
his
manner
to
invite
advice
or
discussion
it
is
too
mysterious
to
theorize
by
jove
it
is
north
agreed
i
never
heard
of
a
case
so
absolutely
strange
i
d
like
to
get
into
that
house
and
see
for
see
what
for
yourself
mr
north
whether
there
s
any
secret
of
course
you
ve
looked
for
that
yes
thoroughly
i
m
of
an
architectural
mind
so
is
mr
north
said
mrs
blackwood
he
designed
this
bungalow
we
re
in
are
you
an
architect
mr
north
not
by
profession
but
i
m
fond
of
it
and
i
flatter
myself
i
could
discover
a
secret
passage
if
such
i
flatter
myself
i
could
too
said
dunn
but
not
boastfully
yet
i
may
have
overlooked
it
i
d
be
obliged
mr
north
if
you
d
come
up
to
the
house
and
give
it
the
once
over
you
might
spot
what
i
failed
to
but
i
don
t
know
the
people
at
no
matter
i
ask
you
as
a
matter
of
assistance
come
up
there
tomorrow
will
you
north
promised
to
do
so
and
dunn
turned
to
eleanor
varian
sorry
to
trouble
you
miss
varian
but
i
have
to
ask
you
some
very
definite
questions
first
do
you
know
your
relatives
up
there
pretty
well
why
yes
said
eleanor
with
a
surprised
look
they
live
in
new
york
and
we
live
in
boston
but
we
visit
each
other
now
and
then
and
we
often
spend
our
summers
at
the
same
place
of
course
i
know
them
then
tell
me
exactly
the
relations
between
miss
varian
and
her
father
don
t
quibble
or
gloss
over
the
facts
they
were
not
entirely
in
accord
it
will
be
found
out
and
you
may
as
well
tell
the
eleanor
varian
looked
thoughtful
i
will
tell
the
truth
she
said
because
i
can
see
it
s
better
to
do
so
betty
and
her
mother
are
much
more
in
sympathy
with
one
another
than
betty
and
her
father
i
don
t
know
what
makes
the
difference
but
aunt
minna
always
seems
to
want
everything
the
way
betty
wants
it
while
uncle
fred
always
wants
just
the
yet
miss
betty
was
fond
of
her
father
oh
yes
they
were
devoted
really
think
only
their
natures
were
was
there
any
special
subject
on
which
they
disagreed
there
has
been
of
late
eleanor
admitted
though
with
evident
reluctance
of
course
betty
is
a
great
belle
of
course
she
has
and
has
had
many
admirers
now
uncle
fred
seems
always
to
be
willing
for
betty
to
have
beaux
and
young
man
friends
but
as
soon
as
they
become
serious
in
their
attentions
and
want
to
marry
betty
then
uncle
fred
shoos
them
it
was
as
yet
impossible
for
eleanor
to
speak
of
her
uncle
in
the
past
tense
the
girl
had
not
at
all
realized
this
sudden
death
and
couldn
t
help
thinking
and
speaking
of
him
as
still
alive
nor
could
she
realize
betty
s
disappearance
she
was
somewhat
in
a
daze
and
also
by
the
awfulness
of
the
situation
she
talked
rapidly
yet
coherently
and
dunn
secretly
rejoiced
at
her
agitation
knowing
he
would
learn
more
than
if
she
had
been
cool
and
collected
but
that
s
not
at
all
an
unusual
thing
put
in
north
who
felt
sorry
for
eleanor
and
wanted
to
relieve
her
all
he
could
from
the
grilling
fire
of
dunn
s
questions
i
find
that
the
majority
of
fathers
resent
the
advances
of
their
daughters
suitors
now
mothers
are
different
encourage
a
match
that
seems
to
them
desirable
but
a
father
can
t
realize
his
little
girl
is
growing
well
lawrence
exclaimed
claire
blackwood
for
a
bachelor
you
seem
to
know
a
lot
about
family
matters
i
ve
lots
of
friends
and
i
can
t
help
noticing
these
things
isn
t
it
true
miss
varian
yes
eleanor
said
to
a
degree
it
is
i
mean
in
some
instances
any
way
it
s
quite
true
of
uncle
fred
and
betty
aunt
minna
would
be
delighted
to
have
betty
engaged
to
some
nice
young
man
but
uncle
fred
flies
in
a
fury
at
mere
mention
of
such
a
i
can
swear
to
that
said
rodney
granniss
i
ve
known
the
varians
for
two
years
and
it
s
quite
true
mrs
varian
smiled
on
the
attachment
between
betty
and
myself
but
mr
varian
most
certainly
did
not
what
exclaimed
dunn
you
one
of
miss
betty
varian
s
suitors
even
so
said
granniss
calmly
i
knew
them
in
new
york
i
came
up
here
to
be
near
betty
and
now
mr
dunn
i
want
to
say
that
i
m
going
to
do
all
i
can
to
solve
the
mystery
of
mr
varian
s
death
but
even
more
especially
am
i
going
to
try
to
find
betty
herself
i
haven
t
been
up
to
headland
house
yet
for
it
seems
awful
to
go
there
now
that
mr
varian
can
t
put
me
out
look
here
young
man
dunn
gazed
at
him
curiously
it
doesn
t
seem
to
occur
to
you
that
you
yourself
may
be
said
to
have
an
interest
in
mr
varian
s
death
meaning
that
i
shot
him
grannis
looked
amused
well
you
can
tell
me
how
i
accomplished
but
my
dear
sir
somebody
accomplished
and
it
might
as
well
be
me
the
only
trouble
with
your
theory
mr
dunn
is
that
i
didn
t
do
it
investigate
all
you
like
you
can
t
pin
the
crime
on
and
i
suppose
you
didn
t
abduct
miss
betty
either
i
did
not
granniss
looked
solemn
i
only
wish
i
had
but
i
m
going
to
find
her
and
i
want
to
start
out
by
being
friendly
with
you
mr
dunn
easy
enough
to
check
up
your
alibi
mr
granniss
dunn
said
no
don
t
tell
me
where
you
were
at
the
time
ll
find
out
for
i
ll
tell
you
said
north
casually
mr
granniss
was
out
in
his
motor
boat
all
the
afternoon
i
know
because
i
was
out
in
mine
and
i
saw
him
frequently
we
were
both
that
s
right
said
granniss
carelessly
as
if
his
alibi
were
of
small
moment
to
him
as
indeed
it
was
now
mr
dunn
you
must
have
some
theory
if
not
a
theory
some
possible
explanation
of
what
occurred
do
give
it
to
yes
do
said
north
i
m
fond
of
detective
stories
but
i
never
read
one
that
started
out
so
mysteriously
as
i
haven
t
any
theory
dunn
looked
at
each
in
turn
his
eyes
roving
round
the
room
as
he
talked
i
can
t
say
as
i
can
even
dope
out
how
it
have
happened
but
here
s
what
i
work
on
that
s
the
thing
to
seek
first
we
know
mr
varian
is
dead
we
know
miss
varian
is
missing
that
s
all
we
really
know
now
you
can
t
deduce
anything
from
those
facts
alone
so
i
say
hunt
for
a
motive
it
isn
t
likely
that
mr
varian
had
any
enemies
up
here
and
if
he
had
they
never
d
chosen
such
an
opportunity
to
shoot
him
just
think
how
sudden
how
unexpected
that
opportunity
was
who
could
have
foreseen
that
miss
varian
would
go
back
to
the
house
for
her
camera
who
could
have
foreseen
that
her
father
would
go
back
after
her
if
those
goings
back
were
unpremeditated
then
no
enemy
could
have
been
there
ready
to
utilize
his
chance
if
on
the
other
hand
those
goings
back
were
premeditated
then
they
were
arranged
by
either
miss
betty
or
her
impossible
cried
north
mr
varian
couldn
t
foresee
that
his
daughter
would
forget
her
camera
and
miss
betty
couldn
t
foresee
that
it
would
be
her
father
who
would
come
back
for
her
i
know
it
seems
that
way
dunn
looked
deeply
perplexed
but
i
can
t
get
away
from
the
idea
of
there
being
some
premeditation
about
the
two
goings
back
to
that
empty
house
that
resulted
in
a
double
suppose
a
began
claire
blackwood
suppose
he
had
been
concealed
in
the
house
before
we
left
to
go
to
the
picnic
suppose
when
betty
came
back
unexpectedly
he
attacked
her
and
then
when
mr
varian
but
what
became
of
the
burglar
of
miss
betty
asked
dunn
i
ve
mulled
over
the
burglar
proposition
i
ve
imagined
him
to
be
one
of
the
servants
but
it
all
comes
back
to
the
fact
that
such
an
intruder
just
simply
couldn
t
get
away
and
couldn
t
get
betty
away
dead
or
that
s
perfectly
true
claire
agreed
there
s
no
way
to
dispose
of
an
imaginary
intruder
but
neither
is
there
any
way
to
dispose
of
betty
nothing
in
this
world
will
make
me
believe
that
girl
shot
her
father
but
just
assuming
for
a
moment
that
she
did
happened
next
claire
demanded
this
with
the
air
of
an
accusing
judge
why
that
s
the
only
possible
theory
said
dunn
say
the
young
lady
did
shoot
her
father
then
she
went
some
place
we
haven
t
yet
discovered
shot
herself
is
there
alive
if
that
s
the
case
i
ll
find
her
rodney
granniss
burst
forth
his
strong
young
face
alight
with
zeal
i
m
going
up
there
at
once
mr
varian
didn
t
like
me
but
mrs
varian
does
and
maybe
i
can
help
she
can
t
see
you
dunn
told
him
she
s
under
the
influence
of
opiates
all
the
time
doctor
varian
keeps
her
that
she
ll
have
to
come
to
her
senses
some
time
said
rod
i
m
going
up
there
any
i
m
going
with
you
declared
eleanor
varian
i
don
t
want
to
stay
here
me
mrs
blackwood
you
re
kindness
itself
i
want
to
be
where
father
and
mother
are
i
want
to
help
find
betty
too
i
know
a
lot
of
places
to
you
do
exclaimed
dunn
where
are
they
now
but
all
that
eleanor
mentioned
dunn
had
already
searched
and
his
hopes
of
the
girl
s
assistance
fell
still
she
might
be
familiar
with
betty
s
ways
and
might
be
of
some
slight
use
well
miss
varian
you
must
do
as
you
think
best
he
said
but
i
advise
you
to
bide
here
till
the
morning
yes
do
dear
urged
claire
and
eleanor
remembering
the
unavoidable
climb
up
the
steep
rocks
consented
tell
me
one
thing
miss
varian
said
dunn
suddenly
were
you
in
the
kitchen
of
the
varian
house
this
afternoon
at
all
yes
i
was
i
went
out
there
with
betty
to
get
some
cakes
and
things
why
when
you
were
there
did
you
notice
a
yellow
sofa
pillow
out
there
in
the
kitchen
no
i
did
not
you
know
the
two
yellow
cushions
that
belong
on
the
hall
sofa
yes
think
i
know
the
ones
you
mean
what
about
them
we
found
one
of
them
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
floor
do
you
think
anybody
could
have
put
it
there
purposely
i
can
t
imagine
why
any
one
should
what
do
you
deduce
from
that
lawrence
north
asked
interestedly
and
claire
said
why
that
s
what
you
call
a
clue
isn
t
it
what
does
it
show
it
doesn
t
show
a
thing
to
me
declared
dunn
leastways
nothing
sensible
look
here
folks
there
was
somebody
else
in
that
house
at
that
time
besides
betty
and
her
father
else
there
wasn
t
now
if
there
was
he
surely
wouldn
t
be
moving
sofa
pillows
about
and
if
there
wasn
t
then
one
of
those
two
people
moved
it
now
why
i
can
t
think
of
any
reason
sensible
or
not
that
would
make
anybody
lug
a
fine
handsome
sofa
cushion
out
to
the
was
it
valuable
enough
to
be
worth
stealing
asked
north
no
a
good
looking
affair
but
nothing
to
tempt
a
looks
like
the
servants
work
i
think
suggested
claire
suppose
one
of
them
had
stayed
behind
and
not
with
any
criminal
intent
either
and
suppose
merely
to
be
luxurious
she
had
taken
a
fine
pillow
out
to
her
kitchen
but
even
so
and
even
if
she
were
caught
by
the
returning
betty
she
couldn
t
have
shot
mr
varian
and
concealed
both
herself
and
you
run
up
against
a
stone
fence
whatever
you
surmise
exclaimed
landon
he
had
been
a
quiet
listener
but
had
done
some
deep
thinking
there
s
only
one
plausible
solution
that
s
a
secret
look
here
mr
landon
dunn
said
sharply
that
speech
gets
on
my
nerves
anybody
who
thinks
there
s
a
secret
passage
in
that
house
up
there
on
the
cliff
is
welcome
to
go
up
there
and
find
it
but
i
m
no
fool
and
sheriff
potter
isn
t
either
nor
is
doctor
herbert
varian
and
none
of
us
can
find
a
secret
passage
and
what
s
more
we
re
positive
there
isn
t
any
so
either
show
where
there
could
be
one
let
up
on
that
good
lord
dunn
don
t
get
so
wrathy
landon
said
and
i
will
go
and
look
for
one
you
invite
me
go
with
me
north
yes
was
the
willing
reply
and
rodney
granniss
said
well
you
fellows
won
t
want
to
make
that
search
till
tomorrow
but
i
m
going
up
to
the
house
now
you
ll
stay
here
won
t
you
miss
varian
reluctantly
eleanor
agreed
to
stay
and
granniss
went
off
alone
rodney
granniss
was
a
determined
man
and
when
he
made
his
mind
to
hunt
for
betty
varian
he
also
made
up
his
mind
to
find
her
to
his
mind
the
very
fact
that
the
whole
case
was
so
inexplicable
made
it
likely
to
develop
some
sudden
clue
or
key
that
would
unlock
the
situation
he
still
felt
averse
to
visiting
a
house
where
his
presence
had
been
forbidden
by
one
who
was
now
unable
to
resent
his
coming
but
this
was
offset
by
his
desire
to
help
mrs
varian
and
to
help
in
finding
betty
he
pondered
over
the
idea
of
a
secret
passage
in
the
house
but
it
was
of
small
comfort
to
him
if
those
other
indefatigable
workers
had
not
been
able
to
find
it
he
had
no
reason
to
think
he
could
do
so
and
besides
it
was
anything
but
an
attractive
picture
to
imagine
betty
either
hidden
voluntarily
or
concealed
against
her
will
in
some
such
place
he
trudged
along
up
the
rocky
steps
and
presented
himself
at
the
door
of
headland
house
sheriff
potter
admitted
him
and
listened
to
his
story
then
he
took
him
to
the
library
and
introduced
him
to
doctor
varian
and
his
wife
i
am
glad
to
see
you
cried
janet
tell
me
of
she
s
all
right
returned
granniss
cheerfully
she
rather
wanted
to
come
up
here
with
me
but
they
persuaded
her
to
stay
over
night
with
mrs
better
so
said
doctor
varian
did
dunn
learn
anything
from
anybody
that
you
know
of
no
said
rodney
and
i
fear
there
s
little
to
learn
from
meaning
meaning
that
whatever
there
is
to
be
learned
must
be
found
out
here
in
this
house
from
any
of
those
sensible
talk
said
doctor
varian
but
how
shall
we
set
about
it
i
don
t
know
i
m
not
possessed
of
what
is
called
detective
instinct
nor
am
i
especially
clever
at
solving
puzzles
but
i
have
determination
and
i
m
going
to
devote
my
whole
time
and
energy
to
finding
betty
varian
well
said
young
man
put
in
potter
who
was
listening
but
untrained
sleuthing
is
not
often
productive
of
great
i
don
t
mean
sleuthing
exactly
and
granniss
looked
at
him
squarely
i
am
untrained
but
i
m
willing
to
be
advised
i
m
willing
to
be
dictated
to
i
only
ask
to
you
re
a
brick
said
janet
i
shouldn
t
be
surprised
if
you
succeed
better
than
the
if
so
it
will
be
because
of
my
more
personal
interest
in
the
case
i
ought
to
tell
you
mrs
varian
that
betty
and
i
are
practically
engaged
it
depended
of
course
on
her
father
s
and
that
he
refused
to
give
asked
potter
yes
he
did
which
immediately
ticketed
me
as
his
murderer
in
the
eyes
of
mr
dunn
but
i
m
not
a
criminal
and
i
didn
t
shoot
mr
varian
i
shan
t
insist
on
this
point
because
you
can
prove
my
words
true
for
yourself
now
i
d
like
a
talk
with
mrs
varian
s
mother
such
a
thing
is
i
m
not
sure
but
it
would
be
a
good
thing
said
doctor
varian
thoughtfully
when
she
wakes
mr
granniss
she
will
either
be
hysterical
still
and
in
need
of
further
opiate
treatment
or
which
i
think
more
likely
will
be
calm
composed
and
alert
minded
in
the
latter
case
she
might
be
glad
to
talk
to
the
man
who
cares
so
much
for
her
i
hope
so
and
in
the
mean
time
what
can
we
do
in
the
matter
of
finding
betty
there
s
nothing
to
be
done
in
that
line
that
hasn
t
been
done
said
the
sheriff
despairingly
all
evening
doctor
and
mrs
varian
as
well
as
the
butler
and
cook
have
been
going
over
the
house
and
the
grounds
calling
and
hunting
for
the
girl
with
no
success
of
any
had
she
a
dog
no
there
is
none
about
now
just
before
you
came
we
were
thinking
of
looking
over
some
of
mr
frederick
varian
s
and
there
s
no
reason
to
change
our
plans
said
doctor
varian
mr
granniss
presence
will
not
so
rodney
sat
by
awaiting
the
possible
awakening
of
mrs
varian
and
trying
hard
to
think
of
some
new
way
to
look
for
betty
with
keys
obtained
from
the
pockets
of
the
dead
man
his
brother
opened
the
drawers
of
the
desk
it
must
be
done
he
said
as
his
hand
slightly
hesitated
and
too
we
may
come
across
some
clue
to
his
among
the
first
of
the
important
papers
found
was
frederick
varian
s
will
the
contents
of
this
were
a
surprise
to
no
one
present
for
the
entire
estate
was
left
to
the
wife
with
instructions
that
she
make
due
and
proper
provisions
for
the
daughter
but
a
final
clause
caused
herbert
varian
to
stare
incredulously
at
the
paper
what
is
it
dear
janet
asked
seeing
his
astonishment
why
janet
the
varian
pearls
are
left
to
eleanor
to
eleanor
no
but
they
are
see
it
s
plain
as
day
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
his
statement
the
final
clause
of
frederick
varian
s
last
will
and
testament
bequeathed
the
string
of
pearls
known
as
the
varian
pearls
to
his
niece
eleanor
the
daughter
of
his
brother
herbert
just
what
is
so
startling
in
that
asked
potter
curiously
and
doctor
varian
replied
the
varian
pearls
are
an
heirloom
and
are
valued
at
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
it
is
the
custom
for
the
oldest
of
the
family
to
inherit
them
and
he
is
expected
to
bequeath
them
to
his
oldest
child
why
did
my
brother
leave
them
to
my
daughter
instead
of
to
betty
herbert
it
s
dreadful
eleanor
shall
not
take
them
janet
cried
that
makes
no
difference
ma
am
potter
said
it
s
the
fact
that
mr
varian
left
them
away
from
his
own
child
that
proves
the
attitude
of
the
father
to
the
daughter
chapter
vii
minna
varian
it
was
not
until
after
the
funeral
of
her
husband
that
minna
varian
really
came
to
herself
the
three
intervening
days
she
had
been
free
from
hysterics
but
had
been
in
a
state
of
physical
exhaustion
and
incapable
of
any
exertion
but
on
the
day
after
the
funeral
she
seemed
to
take
on
a
new
vitality
i
have
come
to
life
she
said
speaking
very
seriously
i
have
at
last
realized
what
has
happened
to
me
i
was
dazed
at
first
and
couldn
t
seem
to
get
my
senses
now
we
will
have
no
more
hysterics
no
more
emotional
scenes
but
we
go
to
work
to
find
my
child
save
what
i
can
from
my
wrecked
life
it
is
a
wonder
that
i
didn
t
lose
my
mind
utterly
think
of
it
herbert
to
lose
my
husband
by
death
and
my
child
by
a
mystery
far
worse
than
minna
showed
signs
of
breaking
down
again
but
forced
herself
to
control
her
voice
i
have
made
up
my
mind
she
went
on
to
go
about
the
search
for
betty
systematically
and
immediately
the
detectives
can
do
nothing
have
proved
that
the
sheriff
and
that
mr
dunn
are
at
the
end
of
their
rope
i
don
t
blame
them
is
a
baffling
case
and
i
know
they
think
betty
s
dead
body
is
hidden
somewhere
on
the
premises
though
how
they
can
think
that
i
don
t
see
after
the
search
that
has
been
they
think
it
janet
said
because
there
s
no
other
possible
conclusion
you
know
yourself
minna
if
betty
were
alive
we
would
know
of
it
by
this
never
mind
theories
or
conclusions
minna
said
determinedly
action
is
what
i
want
i
my
betty
never
killed
her
father
i
know
that
as
well
as
i
know
that
i
m
alive
and
betty
may
be
dead
or
alive
i
m
going
to
find
her
in
any
case
now
first
of
all
i
suppose
you
people
want
to
get
away
from
here
herbert
your
practice
is
calling
you
of
course
i
m
not
going
to
keep
you
but
i
m
going
to
stay
here
on
these
premises
where
my
child
disappeared
until
i
get
some
knowledge
of
what
happened
to
but
minna
varian
objected
you
can
t
stay
here
then
i
ll
get
some
one
to
stay
with
me
i
can
get
a
companion
or
a
nurse
or
a
secretary
see
herbert
there
s
a
lot
of
business
to
be
attended
to
in
connection
with
fred
s
papers
and
affairs
he
left
me
very
well
off
but
the
financial
settling
up
will
call
for
the
trained
work
of
a
good
lawyer
or
young
granniss
spoke
to
me
about
that
doctor
varian
said
he
s
a
bright
young
lawyer
you
know
and
he
thought
perhaps
you
d
employ
him
and
then
he
thought
he
d
help
you
in
the
search
for
i
d
like
that
rod
s
a
nice
chap
and
truly
fred
had
nothing
against
him
except
that
he
wanted
to
take
betty
away
from
us
it
would
be
no
slighting
of
fred
s
wishes
if
i
should
have
to
do
with
mr
granniss
nobody
could
be
better
help
to
me
in
my
i
can
t
see
minna
said
janet
what
you
hope
from
that
search
every
nook
and
cranny
of
this
whole
place
has
been
thoroughly
examined
and
as
nothing
has
been
that
s
just
it
janet
minna
spoke
patiently
because
nothing
has
been
found
is
the
very
reason
i
must
search
more
and
further
i
shall
first
of
all
offer
a
large
reward
the
size
of
the
reward
may
bring
information
when
no
other
means
make
the
offer
as
large
as
you
like
minna
varian
said
but
not
unkindly
for
you
ll
never
be
called
upon
to
pay
it
why
child
there
s
no
hope
i
don
t
want
to
be
brutal
but
really
minna
dear
you
oughtn
t
to
buoy
yourself
up
with
these
false
hopes
that
never
can
be
look
here
herbert
what
do
you
think
happened
to
my
child
who
do
you
think
killed
fred
since
you
ask
me
minna
i
must
say
in
all
honesty
that
i
can
t
see
any
possible
theory
or
any
imaginable
explanation
except
that
betty
shot
her
father
and
then
shot
where
is
she
then
hidden
in
some
secret
cupboard
in
this
house
that
she
knew
of
but
that
we
haven
t
yet
i
can
see
herbert
minna
spoke
slowly
how
you
can
believe
that
because
as
you
say
you
can
t
think
of
any
other
case
but
i
know
betty
never
shot
her
father
i
know
that
i
shall
yet
prove
but
minna
there
must
have
been
more
enmity
between
fred
and
betty
than
you
know
of
to
make
him
leave
the
varian
pearls
to
that
is
incredible
minna
mused
i
can
t
understand
that
and
i
shouldn
t
believe
it
if
it
were
not
right
there
in
fred
s
own
handwriting
i
haven
t
seen
the
pearls
for
some
years
i
ve
been
too
much
of
an
invalid
to
wear
them
often
and
they
ve
stayed
in
the
safe
deposit
for
the
last
five
or
six
years
but
i
meant
betty
should
wear
them
next
winter
of
course
i
was
sure
fred
would
leave
them
to
her
in
his
will
i
can
t
understand
it
it
isn
t
so
much
the
loss
of
the
value
that
affects
me
as
the
appalling
fact
that
he
wanted
to
leave
them
away
from
betty
as
you
say
there
must
have
been
something
between
those
two
desperate
that
i
don
t
know
but
what
could
there
be
janet
said
a
blank
wonder
on
her
face
that
s
the
very
point
said
minna
i
know
there
has
never
been
any
special
or
particular
ground
for
disagreement
between
those
two
except
as
to
the
matter
of
betty
s
getting
married
engaged
fred
never
would
consent
to
that
but
of
course
he
would
have
done
so
later
he
didn
t
approve
of
very
early
marriages
more
i
think
he
dreaded
the
idea
of
betty
s
going
away
from
yet
that
only
proves
a
special
and
even
selfish
fatherly
love
varian
said
and
in
that
case
why
take
the
pearls
away
from
her
i
can
t
understand
it
said
minna
again
it
is
too
amazing
he
adored
betty
and
what
ever
possessed
him
to
give
the
pearls
to
eleanor
liked
eleanor
as
we
all
do
but
he
never
seemed
especially
attached
to
her
not
to
put
her
ahead
of
betty
anyway
of
course
she
shall
never
take
the
pearls
said
janet
decidedly
i
think
fred
was
temporarily
out
of
his
mind
when
he
made
that
will
or
he
was
temporarily
angry
at
betty
when
is
it
dated
that
s
the
strange
part
said
minna
he
made
that
will
ten
years
when
betty
was
only
about
ten
years
old
he
couldn
t
have
been
angry
at
the
child
then
i
think
that
is
the
only
explanation
doctor
varian
said
i
can
t
think
of
any
other
explanation
except
that
fred
was
foolishly
angry
at
the
child
and
in
a
fit
of
silly
temper
made
the
will
giving
the
pearls
to
eleanor
and
then
forgot
all
about
forgot
the
varian
pearls
cried
janet
not
likely
but
i
never
shall
let
eleanor
accept
don
t
say
that
my
dear
remonstrated
her
husband
if
betty
never
is
found
of
course
it
s
right
eleanor
should
have
the
pearls
i
am
the
next
varian
to
fred
and
my
daughter
is
the
rightful
heir
that
s
true
said
minna
but
let
that
matter
rest
for
the
present
if
betty
is
never
found
eleanor
ought
to
have
the
pearls
if
betty
is
found
i
shall
be
so
happy
i
don
t
care
what
becomes
of
them
you
re
right
minna
doctor
varian
said
in
thinking
i
ought
to
get
back
to
the
city
but
janet
or
nell
or
both
will
stay
here
with
you
as
long
as
you
need
or
want
only
till
i
can
get
somebody
else
i
ve
about
concluded
to
take
rodney
granniss
as
secretary
and
have
him
settle
up
fred
s
estate
with
the
of
fred
s
own
lawyers
then
i
ll
have
a
sort
of
nurse
companion
who
can
look
after
me
and
then
i
shall
devote
my
life
and
if
need
be
all
my
money
to
solving
my
mysteries
i
shall
get
the
best
detectives
in
the
country
i
shall
follow
out
also
some
ideas
of
my
own
and
if
success
is
possible
i
shall
attain
minna
sat
upright
her
eyes
shining
with
a
clear
steady
determined
light
she
seemed
another
being
from
the
one
who
had
screamed
in
hysterics
at
first
knowledge
of
her
sorrows
i
ve
found
myself
she
said
in
explanation
i
ve
risen
above
my
dead
self
of
grief
and
sorrow
why
my
desolation
is
so
great
so
unspeakable
that
i
must
do
something
or
go
mad
i
m
not
going
mad
have
too
much
to
do
now
janet
if
you
and
eleanor
one
of
you
will
stay
a
day
or
two
longer
i
ll
get
a
nurse
up
from
the
city
and
as
soon
as
she
arrives
you
can
go
i
know
you
ll
be
glad
to
get
away
from
this
place
of
not
that
minna
dear
but
we
have
several
yes
of
course
i
know
well
plan
for
two
days
more
ll
be
settled
by
that
and
she
was
inside
of
hours
the
now
energetic
woman
had
rodney
granniss
installed
as
her
secretary
and
man
of
business
and
had
secured
the
services
of
a
capable
and
kindly
woman
as
nurse
and
companion
her
new
household
made
up
she
let
her
relatives
go
back
to
their
own
summer
home
and
devoted
herself
to
her
life
work
of
course
she
said
to
granniss
we
must
go
ahead
on
the
supposition
that
betty
is
and
she
is
mrs
varian
the
young
man
said
earnestly
for
north
and
i
have
been
all
over
this
place
and
north
is
a
sort
of
an
architect
you
know
and
i
m
sort
of
a
detective
and
we
can
t
find
any
place
where
any
one
could
be
concealed
now
it
doesn
t
do
any
good
as
some
do
to
say
there
must
be
a
secret
passage
or
secret
cupboard
if
there
were
we
must
have
found
it
and
it
s
too
ridiculous
even
to
think
for
a
minute
that
betty
killed
her
father
i
know
betty
even
better
perhaps
than
you
or
her
father
ever
knew
her
we
have
been
sweethearts
for
nearly
a
year
and
i
tried
many
a
time
to
persuade
betty
to
defy
her
father
and
announce
her
engagement
to
me
she
would
have
done
so
soon
i
m
sure
but
it
was
her
love
and
respect
for
him
that
made
her
hold
off
so
long
as
to
their
little
squabbles
they
meant
nothing
at
all
to
imagine
that
girl
shooting
anybody
is
too
absurd
i
could
rather
granniss
paused
and
minna
took
up
his
thought
you
could
rather
imagine
her
father
shooting
her
i
ve
thought
that
over
but
you
see
it
s
impossible
because
there
was
no
weapon
it
s
the
strangest
case
i
ever
heard
of
now
about
the
reward
it
s
time
that
was
attended
yes
and
i
think
we
ll
make
it
as
high
as
ten
thousand
dollars
for
betty
s
return
yes
that
is
for
any
information
that
may
lead
to
knowledge
of
what
happened
to
betty
and
where
she
is
nothing
about
apprehending
the
criminal
you
know
mr
granniss
they
make
fun
of
me
for
imagining
this
how
could
there
be
one
how
did
he
get
in
the
house
how
did
he
disappear
again
you
say
yourself
there
s
no
secret
passage
know
nobody
came
in
through
the
regular
way
then
even
suggest
a
criminal
yes
but
why
offer
a
reward
if
there
s
no
one
who
could
by
any
chance
appear
to
claim
it
that
s
the
point
doctor
varian
makes
he
says
it
doesn
t
matter
how
large
we
make
the
offer
for
it
never
will
be
then
we
ll
just
assume
that
criminal
and
go
ahead
with
the
reward
plan
said
granniss
cheerfully
i
ll
attend
to
it
and
we
won
t
speculate
on
its
result
at
present
it
surely
can
t
do
any
harm
but
mrs
varian
we
must
do
more
than
what
for
instance
detectives
i
think
you
should
get
the
best
one
you
can
and
get
him
up
here
at
please
do
that
mr
granniss
what
do
you
do
apply
to
a
city
agency
yes
or
get
a
private
detective
i
know
of
one
best
there
is
in
the
country
but
we
might
not
be
able
to
get
try
anyway
offer
any
price
bonus
only
get
very
well
ll
try
i
have
to
go
down
to
new
york
soon
for
there
are
many
important
matters
to
see
to
with
mr
varian
s
lawyers
i
ll
see
about
this
detective
minna
had
replaced
the
servants
who
had
left
her
with
maids
from
the
village
there
were
some
who
were
glad
to
go
to
a
house
suddenly
made
famous
by
such
an
astounding
mystery
others
declared
the
house
was
haunted
and
wouldn
t
go
near
it
among
those
who
inclined
to
the
haunted
house
idea
was
the
new
nurse
a
mrs
fletcher
she
was
of
a
psychic
turn
of
mind
and
while
she
didn
t
exactly
believe
betty
was
carried
off
by
spooks
yet
she
thought
the
girl
might
have
taken
her
own
life
and
perhaps
her
father
s
because
of
supernatural
influences
or
directions
rubbish
minna
varian
told
her
my
betty
was
healthy
normal
girl
she
has
none
of
those
foolish
notions
of
the
occult
or
it
s
the
only
explanation
said
mrs
fletcher
doggedly
and
i
do
think
the
house
is
haunted
heard
mysterious
sounds
last
night
rustling
of
minna
varian
only
looked
amused
at
this
but
granniss
who
was
present
said
that
s
interesting
mrs
fletcher
tell
me
about
the
account
however
was
merely
a
vague
idea
of
sounds
that
might
have
been
mysterious
but
were
more
likely
made
by
the
servants
going
about
at
night
sheriff
potter
and
his
colleague
bill
dunn
had
practically
given
up
the
matter
they
pretended
to
be
working
on
it
but
as
they
themselves
put
it
what
can
you
do
when
you
can
t
do
nothin
there
was
room
for
much
discussion
but
when
it
came
to
action
what
was
there
to
be
done
you
can
t
hunt
a
criminal
when
you
ve
no
reason
to
assume
any
criminal
intent
you
can
t
hunt
for
a
missing
girl
after
you
ve
scoured
all
the
places
where
she
could
by
any
possibility
be
found
you
can
t
hunt
for
the
murderer
of
a
man
when
there
was
no
way
for
a
murderer
to
be
on
the
scene
then
are
you
going
to
give
up
the
quest
granniss
asked
of
the
sheriff
no
not
that
potter
said
uneasily
we
re
open
to
suggestion
re
keen
for
any
new
clue
or
testimony
where
can
we
look
for
such
you
must
see
mr
granniss
that
it
s
a
mighty
unusual
case
most
mysterious
and
unsolvable
i
do
see
that
and
that
s
why
i
m
going
to
get
expert
go
ahead
said
potter
agreeably
i
ll
be
glad
to
see
any
man
who
can
handle
the
thing
why
there
s
no
handle
to
it
no
place
to
catch
hold
here
s
a
man
killed
and
a
girl
missing
now
we
ve
no
more
idea
what
happened
to
those
two
people
than
we
had
at
the
moment
of
the
discovery
of
the
that
s
perfectly
and
what
s
more
we
never
will
have
that
mystery
will
never
be
you
re
saying
that
mr
potter
doesn
t
necessarily
make
it
no
but
it
s
true
all
the
same
if
miss
betty
was
in
any
way
to
blame
i
can
t
believe
ll
never
find
out
anything
because
if
she
s
alive
she
d
have
shown
up
by
this
go
on
if
miss
betty
was
not
to
then
whoever
was
to
blame
made
a
blame
good
job
of
it
you
ll
never
catch
him
that
s
the
principle
i
m
going
to
work
on
idea
that
somebody
did
do
it
he
did
make
a
good
job
of
it
that
i
am
going
to
catch
him
fine
talk
but
there
s
the
same
old
stumbling
block
you
can
t
argue
an
outsider
intruder
without
allowing
a
secret
entrance
to
that
house
you
say
there
isn
t
there
sure
isn
well
suppose
your
criminal
didn
t
arrive
and
depart
in
an
aeroplane
i
ve
thought
of
that
it
isn
t
possible
you
see
there
were
half
a
dozen
people
looking
on
all
the
time
i
wish
i
d
been
there
twouldn
t
have
done
any
good
you
couldn
t
a
seen
more
n
anybody
else
did
there
was
nothing
to
no
agreed
granniss
there
was
nothing
to
be
lawrence
north
came
up
to
the
house
again
at
rod
s
request
and
once
more
they
looked
for
a
secret
room
or
cupboard
armed
with
a
yardstick
and
measuring
tape
they
went
through
the
house
from
roof
to
cellar
they
paced
floors
and
measured
walls
and
tapped
ceilings
and
proved
to
their
own
conviction
that
there
was
no
foot
of
space
in
the
whole
structure
unaccounted
for
it
isn
t
said
north
as
if
it
were
an
old
english
manor
house
or
a
medieval
castle
it
s
modern
it
isn
t
built
with
any
sinister
plan
or
any
desire
for
secret
maneuvers
there
never
was
any
smuggling
going
on
up
as
far
as
this
and
anyway
this
is
a
simple
pleasure
house
built
for
a
pleasant
simple
family
life
i
ve
looked
up
the
builders
and
they
say
it
was
built
by
a
commonplace
man
with
a
commonplace
family
they
moved
out
of
the
state
long
ago
but
there
never
was
anything
secretive
or
mysterious
about
they
spent
a
long
time
in
the
cellar
but
here
too
there
was
no
uncertain
space
everything
was
built
every
room
bin
or
cupboard
was
as
plainly
defined
as
those
above
and
there
was
no
hiding
place
possible
granniss
looked
down
the
old
dried
up
well
dunn
went
down
that
lawrence
said
nothing
i
ve
got
to
go
down
myself
returned
rodney
shortly
as
he
took
off
his
coat
be
careful
then
north
admonished
him
i
ll
hold
the
a
good
strong
flashlight
illumined
the
old
well
and
rod
granniss
clambered
down
its
stone
sides
but
he
returned
with
the
same
message
dunn
had
brought
all
dried
up
nothing
down
there
but
a
muddy
bottom
and
no
stones
missing
no
all
solid
and
complete
i
gave
it
a
most
careful
scrutiny
for
i
don
t
want
to
have
to
go
down
well
that
finishes
the
cellar
yes
and
finishes
the
house
you
must
admit
lawrence
there
s
no
possible
chance
of
betty
varian
being
in
this
house
dead
or
of
course
i
admit
that
what
then
i
can
t
even
suggest
can
you
there
s
nothing
left
but
that
she
went
away
somehow
to
elude
the
watchers
they
were
not
noticing
the
you
talk
as
if
she
could
get
down
from
this
headland
by
any
other
route
than
right
past
where
the
crowd
were
maybe
she
hid
here
in
the
house
until
after
oh
don
t
suggest
such
awful
things
betty
kill
her
father
and
then
hiding
until
dark
make
her
way
out
and
down
to
the
village
and
away
from
the
impossible
alternative
i
don
t
know
the
more
i
think
it
over
the
less
i
can
see
solution
what
about
the
haunted
house
idea
that
doesn
t
mean
a
thing
to
me
granniss
scorned
it
in
fact
i
usually
come
back
to
the
idea
that
mr
varian
in
some
way
killed
weapon
i
know
but
i
mean
maybe
he
shot
himself
and
betty
who
might
have
been
trying
to
prevent
it
took
the
pistol
and
ran
why
oh
i
don
t
you
are
too
exasperating
lawrence
you
just
stand
there
and
say
why
stop
keep
your
temper
rod
i
m
only
trying
as
you
are
to
find
some
way
to
look
it
is
indeed
impenetrable
and
then
that
matter
of
the
to
me
that
is
the
strangest
revelation
yet
no
matter
how
much
the
father
and
daughter
had
little
disagreements
even
quarrels
how
could
he
leave
that
great
treasure
away
from
his
child
and
give
it
to
his
niece
i
think
that
very
thing
is
a
key
to
the
how
do
you
mean
i
don
t
know
you
know
i
don
t
know
lawrence
if
i
did
i
d
have
told
long
ago
but
i
believe
when
the
worthwhile
detective
that
i
m
going
to
get
for
mrs
varian
takes
hold
of
the
case
he
ll
work
from
that
strange
bequest
of
the
varian
maybe
he
will
to
me
it
s
passing
strange
it
doesn
t
seem
to
indicate
anything
no
nor
to
me
but
we
haven
t
the
trained
mind
of
the
real
who
s
the
man
you
re
going
to
get
pennington
wise
the
best
in
the
i
ve
heard
of
him
well
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
he
goes
about
chapter
viii
ransom
the
herbert
varians
went
back
to
their
summer
home
and
minna
left
alone
with
her
companion
and
her
secretary
began
what
she
called
her
campaign
to
find
betty
some
people
thought
mrs
varian
a
little
affected
mentally
by
her
awful
griefs
but
those
who
knew
her
best
read
in
her
determination
and
persistence
a
steady
aim
and
felt
a
slight
hope
of
her
success
anything
in
the
world
i
can
do
dear
claire
blackwood
said
to
her
command
me
i
ll
go
to
the
city
for
you
or
do
errands
or
anything
i
no
said
minna
there
s
nothing
you
can
do
nothing
anybody
can
do
i
m
only
afraid
that
if
i
get
no
encouragement
in
my
efforts
i
will
lose
my
mind
that
s
what
i
m
trying
to
guard
against
i
follow
my
nurse
s
directions
as
to
exercise
diet
and
all
that
but
i
feel
as
if
i
could
only
keep
my
brain
from
flying
to
pieces
by
hanging
onto
my
hope
of
eventually
finding
my
and
you
will
claire
said
earnestly
though
she
voiced
a
belief
that
she
was
far
from
feeling
oh
mrs
varian
you
will
you
see
minna
went
on
i
ve
a
new
theory
now
i
think
that
maybe
betty
killed
her
father
that
is
a
new
yes
i
know
it
s
almost
incredible
what
idea
isn
t
say
mr
varian
went
suddenly
insane
i
can
t
think
of
any
other
way
attacked
betty
with
a
revolver
say
trying
to
protect
herself
it
went
off
and
killed
him
the
weapon
was
in
his
hands
perhaps
in
hers
then
the
child
in
an
agony
of
fear
or
remorse
ran
away
don
t
know
how
she
got
away
don
t
you
see
mrs
blackwood
she
must
have
left
the
premises
somehow
or
they
would
have
found
her
by
this
time
of
now
i
ve
offered
ten
thousand
dollars
reward
for
any
information
that
will
lead
to
finding
betty
or
alive
mr
granniss
thinks
it
will
bring
no
results
but
i
can
t
help
hoping
and
if
it
doesn
t
can
i
do
you
re
going
to
employ
a
detective
aren
t
you
these
local
authorities
are
not
capable
of
managing
a
case
like
yes
mr
granniss
advises
a
mr
wise
i
can
t
see
what
any
detective
can
do
there
s
nothing
to
detect
as
i
can
that
s
just
it
we
can
t
see
the
trained
detective
here
is
your
mail
mrs
varian
said
granniss
coming
into
the
room
will
you
run
it
over
minna
glanced
at
the
letters
mostly
notes
of
sympathy
or
letters
of
advice
from
helpful
friends
but
there
was
one
that
caused
her
to
exclaim
in
amazement
oh
rodney
she
cried
will
you
look
at
this
so
great
was
her
agitation
that
claire
blackwood
went
in
search
of
the
nurse
for
she
feared
some
emotional
outburst
beyond
her
power
to
control
the
disturbing
letter
was
a
plain
looking
affair
on
ordinary
letter
paper
and
it
read
mrs
varian
we
have
your
daughter
safe
we
are
holding
her
for
ransom
your
reward
does
not
tempt
us
at
all
but
if
you
are
ready
to
pay
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
you
may
have
your
child
back
if
not
you
will
never
see
her
again
there
must
be
no
dickering
no
fooling
and
above
all
no
police
interference
i
will
not
go
into
details
now
but
if
you
want
to
take
up
with
this
offer
put
a
personal
in
any
of
the
large
boston
papers
saying
i
agree
and
all
directions
will
be
sent
to
you
as
to
how
to
proceed
but
if
you
tell
the
police
or
allow
any
detective
to
know
anything
about
this
deal
it
is
all
off
don
t
think
you
can
fool
us
we
have
eyes
in
the
back
of
our
heads
and
any
insincerity
or
breach
of
faith
on
your
part
will
result
in
sad
results
to
your
daughter
to
carry
this
thing
through
you
must
trust
and
obey
us
implicitly
and
any
lapse
will
mean
far
deeper
trouble
than
you
are
in
the
letter
was
not
signed
nor
was
it
dated
the
postmark
was
boston
and
it
had
been
mailed
the
day
before
it
s
a
fake
granniss
declared
at
once
i
don
t
think
so
said
claire
blackwood
it
sounds
real
to
i
don
t
care
whether
it
s
real
or
not
minna
interrupted
excitedly
i
mean
i
don
t
care
whether
anybody
believes
it
s
real
or
not
i
m
going
to
answer
it
at
once
and
i
m
going
to
agree
to
everything
they
say
and
i
m
not
going
to
tell
the
police
or
a
detective
or
anybody
i
m
going
to
get
betty
her
face
was
radiant
with
joy
her
eyes
shone
and
she
was
smiling
for
the
first
time
since
that
awful
day
of
the
double
tragedy
now
look
here
mrs
varian
began
granniss
who
was
convinced
the
whole
letter
was
a
mere
attempt
to
get
money
under
false
pretenses
you
mustn
t
throw
away
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
that
fashion
why
not
it
is
a
lot
of
money
but
i
have
the
sum
and
it
means
getting
betty
back
what
is
any
sum
of
money
my
whole
fortune
against
that
but
it
doesn
t
surely
mean
getting
her
back
if
i
thought
it
did
i
d
feel
just
as
you
do
about
oh
it
does
does
minna
cried
her
face
still
transfigured
with
happiness
i
know
it
feel
in
my
heart
tells
me
that
it
is
true
you
see
it
explains
everything
these
people
kidnapped
betty
her
and
now
they
re
holding
her
for
ransom
they
ll
get
it
i
ll
get
betty
they
don
t
want
her
you
see
but
they
do
want
the
money
and
they
ll
get
it
i
agree
with
mrs
varian
claire
said
quite
convinced
by
minna
s
confidence
in
the
good
faith
of
the
letter
writer
but
it
s
too
absurd
insisted
rodney
you
know
varian
you
must
know
that
i
want
to
find
betty
quite
as
much
as
you
do
i
won
t
qualify
that
statement
i
love
her
as
much
as
you
can
but
i
don
t
believe
for
one
minute
that
that
letter
is
genuine
i
mean
i
don
t
believe
the
man
who
wrote
it
has
betty
or
ever
saw
her
why
think
a
minute
of
all
the
theories
regarding
betty
s
disappearance
abduction
is
the
least
believable
how
could
any
one
abduct
betty
that
day
could
the
kidnapper
get
into
this
house
and
out
again
betty
so
many
people
were
about
watching
i
don
t
know
how
it
was
done
minna
said
doggedly
but
it
s
a
chance
and
i
m
going
to
take
it
you
can
t
stop
me
rodney
you
ve
no
authority
to
say
what
i
shall
do
with
my
own
money
i
ve
a
right
to
try
this
but
oh
said
claire
suppose
it
should
be
a
fake
not
only
you
d
lose
all
that
money
think
of
your
disappointment
the
disappointment
would
be
no
worse
than
things
are
at
oh
yes
it
would
if
you
follow
up
that
letter
and
pay
all
that
sum
and
then
get
nothing
in
return
it
would
just
about
kill
it
would
just
about
kill
me
not
to
take
the
chance
returned
minna
now
i
suppose
i
still
have
the
right
to
order
my
own
movements
i
shall
at
once
send
the
personal
to
the
boston
paper
ll
put
it
in
several
so
he
ll
be
sure
to
see
it
then
i
ll
await
his
further
advice
will
you
send
the
messages
rodney
or
must
i
do
it
myself
of
course
i
am
at
your
orders
mrs
rod
gave
her
his
winning
smile
but
at
least
let
s
think
it
over
a
no
send
the
word
at
once
we
can
talk
it
over
there
seemed
to
be
no
way
out
so
granniss
went
off
to
do
her
bidding
even
then
he
had
half
a
mind
to
pretend
to
send
the
word
but
really
to
withhold
it
on
reflection
he
concluded
he
had
no
right
to
do
this
but
he
remembered
that
minna
had
not
bound
him
to
secrecy
though
of
course
it
was
implied
so
with
the
letters
to
the
boston
papers
went
also
one
to
pennington
wise
begging
him
to
come
at
once
to
investigate
the
remarkable
case
of
betty
varian
and
telling
him
frankly
of
the
strange
letter
just
received
that
same
afternoon
a
telegram
came
for
mrs
varian
granniss
opened
it
as
was
his
custom
and
its
contents
so
surprised
him
that
he
nearly
succumbed
to
the
temptation
to
keep
it
from
mrs
varian
but
he
reconsidered
he
had
no
right
to
presume
on
his
position
as
confidential
secretary
so
with
grave
fears
of
its
effects
he
handed
it
to
her
dear
mother
it
ran
i
am
all
right
and
if
you
do
just
as
you
agree
i
will
soon
be
with
you
again
please
obey
implicitly
from
her
minna
cried
and
fainted
nurse
fletcher
soon
revived
her
but
she
was
in
a
shaken
nervous
state
and
could
stand
no
contradiction
or
disapproval
now
you
see
rodney
she
cried
triumphantly
it
is
all
right
here
is
word
from
betty
my
darling
and
she
fell
to
kissing
the
yellow
paper
as
if
it
were
the
face
of
her
child
but
mrs
varian
granniss
hesitated
to
correct
her
but
felt
he
must
that
may
not
be
from
betty
you
know
anybody
could
send
a
telegram
signed
with
betty
s
rodney
minna
s
eyes
blazed
with
anger
why
do
you
try
every
way
to
make
me
miserable
why
dash
every
cup
of
joy
from
my
lips
you
seem
to
hope
that
we
never
find
betty
i
can
t
understand
your
attitude
but
unless
you
are
more
helpful
and
more
hopeful
don
t
think
we
can
get
along
but
granniss
knew
that
he
must
stand
by
this
distracted
woman
another
secretary
might
have
more
leniency
and
less
judgment
which
would
be
a
bad
thing
for
minna
s
interests
no
even
at
risk
of
letting
her
be
imprudent
he
must
stand
by
her
and
protect
her
all
he
could
against
her
own
wrong
decisions
oh
yes
we
ll
get
along
all
right
mrs
varian
he
said
trying
to
treat
the
matter
lightly
you
can
t
get
rid
of
me
so
easily
too
you
know
that
i
want
to
believe
all
this
quite
as
much
as
you
do
but
you
must
admit
that
a
telegram
is
not
like
a
letter
it
might
be
well
this
isn
t
said
minna
contentedly
still
caressing
the
paper
missive
let
s
consider
it
said
rod
it
doesn
t
sound
to
me
like
betty
s
diction
would
she
use
the
word
implicitly
why
not
minna
stared
at
him
and
too
she
wrote
it
under
compulsion
most
likely
oh
my
darling
child
the
mercy
of
those
ruffians
yet
i
make
no
doubt
they
re
good
to
her
why
should
they
harm
my
baby
they
only
want
the
ransom
money
and
that
they
shall
have
i
m
glad
it
s
a
large
sum
it
makes
me
more
sure
i
ll
get
granniss
was
in
despair
he
felt
the
awful
responsibility
of
mrs
varian
s
wild
determination
but
he
couldn
t
see
anything
to
do
about
it
to
report
to
doctor
varian
was
not
his
duty
and
though
he
thought
it
was
his
duty
to
tell
the
story
to
the
police
minna
had
exacted
his
promise
not
to
do
so
and
he
had
given
it
after
all
it
was
her
money
she
chose
to
give
it
up
so
easily
it
was
not
his
affair
and
too
he
couldn
t
help
a
lurking
hope
that
it
might
be
all
true
and
might
result
in
betty
s
restoration
to
her
sorrowing
mother
to
himself
for
he
knew
now
that
the
opposing
influence
of
her
father
was
removed
if
betty
should
ever
be
found
she
would
some
day
be
his
wife
he
trusted
in
her
faith
and
loyalty
to
himself
as
he
believed
in
his
own
to
her
and
yet
he
couldn
t
approve
of
minna
s
wholesale
compliance
with
the
exorbitant
demands
of
people
who
might
be
and
probably
were
mere
swindlers
he
was
thinking
these
things
over
when
mrs
varian
came
to
him
i
want
you
to
go
right
down
to
new
york
she
told
him
and
get
me
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
cash
now
don
t
raise
objections
for
i
should
only
combat
them
and
it
takes
my
strength
so
to
argue
with
you
my
husband
s
fortune
is
mine
there
is
no
one
to
dictate
to
me
how
i
shall
use
it
i
want
insist
upon
this
sum
in
cash
or
some
sort
of
bonds
or
securities
that
may
be
cashed
by
anybody
without
identification
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
want
the
money
in
such
shape
that
these
kidnappers
will
take
it
willingly
of
course
they
won
t
accept
checks
or
notes
go
on
now
rodney
get
off
at
once
and
get
back
as
soon
as
you
can
and
i
want
some
man
to
stay
in
this
house
while
you
re
away
i
m
not
exactly
timid
but
i
ve
never
stayed
nights
in
a
house
without
a
man
in
it
the
butler
i
mean
i
m
sure
you
can
invite
some
friend
who
would
be
willing
to
come
perhaps
mr
landon
he
s
so
nice
and
i
d
try
to
make
it
pleasant
for
him
in
any
way
i
could
there
are
plenty
of
books
and
with
good
cigars
he
might
be
oh
he
d
be
contented
all
right
but
landon
s
gone
off
on
a
little
trip
he
won
t
be
back
for
several
days
how
d
you
like
to
have
north
probably
he
d
very
well
he
s
perfectly
willing
i
d
hate
to
bore
him
you

be
back

ll
have
to
be

nights

good
i
hate
to
ask
it
of
any
of
them
but
i
hate
worse
to
stay
alone
i
d
get
nervous
and
i
shouldn
t
sleep
at
that
s
all
right
mrs
varian
i
know
how
you
feel
about
it
and
i
ll
get
granniss
was
as
good
as
his
word
and
finding
that
lawrence
north
was
glad
to
do
anything
in
his
power
to
help
mrs
varian
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
visit
at
headland
house
until
rodney
could
get
back
from
new
york
but
promise
me
granniss
said
that
if
you
get
further
letters
from
the
kidnappers
you
won
t
do
anything
definite
until
i
i
can
t
said
minna
thoughtfully
i
wouldn
t
promise
anyway
but
as
you
must
see
for
yourself
i
can
t
do
anything
till
i
get
that
i
suppose
not
granniss
agreed
and
went
off
during
a
sociable
and
chatty
evening
minna
told
north
about
the
letter
from
the
abductors
oh
mrs
varian
he
exclaimed
you
don
t
believe
it
do
you
i
only
wonder
you
haven
t
had
several
it
s
a
common
way
of
crooks
to
attempt
to
get
but
this
rings
so
true
minna
defended
herself
and
showed
him
the
letter
north
studied
it
it
sounds
plausible
enough
he
said
but
how
is
it
possible
how
could
anyone
have
kidnapped
the
girl
now
look
here
mr
north
don
t
say
over
and
over
again
how
could
he
you
know
somebody
or
something
is
responsible
for
betty
s
disappearance
as
well
as
for
mr
varian
s
death
don
t
think
for
a
minute
that
my
anxiety
about
my
daughter
in
any
way
obliterates
or
lessens
my
grief
at
my
husband
s
death
but
as
you
must
see
nothing
can
bring
mr
varian
back
while
may
bring
betty
back
can
you
wonder
then
that
i
catch
at
any
straw
in
any
hope
up
with
any
suggestion
on
the
mere
chance
of
getting
my
child
back
if
they
had
asked
for
my
whole
fortune
i
should
pay
the
chance
yes
north
spoke
slowly
i
see
how
you
feel
about
it
you
ought
to
have
some
proof
that
they
really
have
your
i
ve
thought
about
that
minna
shuddered
but
i
ve
read
of
these
cases
they
send
a
it
s
oh
now
now
don
t
be
morbid
i
don
t
mean
anything
of
that
sort
but
if
they
would
give
you
a
bit
of
her
hair
or
a
scrap
of
her
own
but
how
can
i
demand
that
how
can
i
ask
for
it
you
just
wait
for
their
next
instruction
if
they
are
sincere
in
this
offer
if
they
really
have
miss
betty
and
are
really
ready
to
negotiate
they
must
tell
you
what
to
do
next
and
mrs
varian
i
advise
you
to
do
it
it
may
be
a
wrong
principle
but
your
case
is
exceptional
since
you
ve
showed
me
this
letter
i
can
t
help
feeling
it
s
the
real
thing
for
one
thing
you
can
see
it
s
written
by
at
least
a
fairly
well
educated
man
i
mean
not
by
the
common
ignorant
class
moreover
the
very
audacity
of
demanding
such
enormous
ransom
indicates
to
my
mind
that
the
writer
can
perform
his
part
of
the
bargain
a
mere
crook
writing
a
fake
letter
would
never
dream
of
asking
such
a
sum
how
are
you
going
to
manage
the
payment
if
you
mean
the
method
of
handing
it
over
i
don
t
know
i
shall
do
as
i
m
directed
if
you
mean
how
shall
i
obtain
the
cash
i
ve
asked
mr
granniss
to
bring
it
up
from
new
york
for
is
he
going
to
travel
home
with
that
sum
on
his
person
yes
he
said
he
had
no
fear
in
that
oh
no
since
no
one
knows
of
it
he
runs
little
meantime
rodney
granniss
in
new
york
was
putting
through
his
errands
in
record
time
he
attended
to
the
money
matter
and
by
the
aid
of
some
influential
friends
of
the
varian
family
he
obtained
the
desired
sum
in
cash
and
unregistered
bonds
then
he
went
to
see
pennington
wise
that
astute
detective
declared
himself
too
busy
to
accept
any
new
commission
but
after
granniss
had
personally
told
the
astonishing
details
of
the
case
wise
was
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
to
undertake
its
investigation
the
way
you
put
it
mr
granniss
he
said
it
sounds
like
an
impossible
condition
i
can
t
see
any
explanation
at
all
but
as
we
know
there
be
one
the
obvious
solution
is
a
secret
passage
but
since
you
tell
me
there
is
none
i
feel
i
must
go
up
there
and
see
for
myself
what
could
have
then
you
ll
come
yes
ll
drop
all
else
and
go
straight
off
we
won
t
travel
together
though
you
go
ahead
right
now
and
i
ll
follow
soon
and
by
the
way
re
carrying
that
money
with
you
let
me
take
it
it
s
far
safer
rod
granniss
opened
his
eyes
wide
was
this
strange
man
asking
him
to
transfer
his
trusted
errand
to
him
wise
laughed
i
can
t
say
i
blame
you
for
not
wanting
to
hand
it
over
but
this
i
do
tell
you
will
be
safe
with
me
it
may
not
be
with
why
nobody
knows
i
have
it
even
so
i
strongly
advise
your
letting
me
take
it
you
must
do
as
you
you
ll
get
it
safely
up
to
mrs
varian
granniss
said
reluctantly
producing
the
rather
bulky
parcel
yes
i
will
if
i
don
t
ll
make
the
loss
he
looked
meaningly
at
the
younger
man
and
flushing
a
little
rodney
said
that
s
right
wise
i
couldn
t
make
it
good
if
i
lost
it
take
and
with
no
further
security
than
the
detective
s
word
granniss
handed
over
the
money
he
went
to
his
train
in
a
most
perturbed
spirit
had
he
done
right
or
not
it
all
depended
on
the
fidelity
of
the
detective
to
be
sure
granniss
had
every
confidence
in
him
but
the
sum
of
money
was
so
large
that
it
might
well
prove
a
temptation
to
hitherto
impeccable
honesty
he
boarded
his
train
still
uncertain
of
the
wisdom
of
his
course
and
more
uncertain
as
to
what
mrs
varian
would
say
but
he
reasoned
if
they
were
to
employ
the
services
of
one
of
the
best
and
best
known
detectives
in
the
country
it
was
surely
right
to
obey
his
first
bit
of
advice
this
thought
comforted
granniss
somewhat
and
he
was
further
comforted
by
an
event
which
took
place
that
night
and
which
proved
the
wisdom
of
the
detective
s
advice
granniss
was
asleep
in
his
lower
berth
when
the
merest
feeling
of
a
cautious
movement
above
awakened
him
he
could
hear
no
sound
but
through
eyes
he
saw
the
occupant
of
the
berth
above
crawl
silently
down
and
stealthily
reach
for
rodney
s
clothes
which
were
folded
at
the
foot
of
the
berth
interested
rather
than
afraid
granniss
watched
the
performance
keeping
his
own
eyes
nearly
closed
it
was
too
dark
for
him
to
see
the
marauder
who
worked
entirely
by
feeling
and
who
swiftly
examined
the
clothing
of
his
victim
and
then
turned
his
attention
to
his
bag
still
granniss
made
no
sign
for
he
preferred
to
see
the
chagrin
of
the
robber
rather
than
to
interrupt
him
at
his
work
the
bag
yielded
nothing
of
interest
and
then
the
upper
berth
man
came
along
and
slipped
his
hand
under
granniss
pillow
deftly
done
as
it
was
rodney
shot
out
his
own
hand
and
grabbed
the
wrist
of
the
other
but
it
was
twisted
away
from
him
and
in
an
instant
the
man
was
back
in
his
own
berth
rod
thought
it
over
and
concluded
to
raise
no
outcry
in
the
morning
he
would
see
who
his
visitor
was
and
then
take
such
steps
as
he
thought
best
he
fell
asleep
and
when
he
awoke
the
sun
was
up
and
his
robber
had
disappeared
chagrined
at
his
own
stupidity
in
but
rejoiced
at
the
safety
of
mrs
varian
s
money
granniss
went
on
with
his
journey
home
but
when
he
found
on
the
floor
of
the
car
a
handkerchief
that
had
been
under
his
pillow
he
realized
that
a
still
further
search
for
treasure
had
been
made
beneath
his
sleeping
head
chapter
ix
poor
martha
when
granniss
stepped
off
the
train
at
headland
harbor
there
were
but
few
other
passengers
who
alighted
at
the
same
time
but
one
of
these
a
mild
young
man
came
nearer
rodney
and
said
quietly
mr
granniss
may
i
speak
to
you
a
moment
certainly
rod
answered
after
a
quick
glance
at
him
i
am
a
messenger
from
mr
wise
i
have
with
me
the
money
for
mrs
varian
shall
i
give
it
to
you
here
or
go
up
to
the
house
with
you
and
carry
it
no
one
seems
to
be
observing
us
take
it
if
you
rodney
stared
at
him
wise
then
had
sent
his
messenger
with
the
money
along
on
the
same
train
by
this
means
he
had
outwitted
the
man
in
the
upper
berth
who
without
question
knew
of
granniss
errand
and
who
had
thus
been
foiled
in
his
attempt
to
rob
him
good
for
you
granniss
exclaimed
heartily
i
think
it
will
be
all
right
for
me
to
take
it
now
is
the
varian
car
but
would
you
prefer
to
go
up
to
the
house
no
i
d
rather
not
i
m
sure
the
way
is
clear
now
i
saw
that
performance
in
the
train
last
night
but
don
t
talk
any
more
about
it
just
take
the
box
and
i
ll
go
right
back
on
the
next
train
mr
wise
will
arrive
marveling
at
the
detective
s
way
of
managing
granniss
took
the
unimportant
looking
parcel
the
young
man
offered
and
with
a
brief
got
into
the
varian
car
the
car
could
go
only
to
the
lodge
gate
and
from
there
rodney
trudged
up
the
steep
path
to
the
house
half
afraid
that
some
bandit
would
even
yet
appear
to
rob
him
of
the
treasure
but
nothing
untoward
happened
and
he
reached
headland
house
in
safety
it
was
nearly
noon
when
he
arrived
and
lawrence
north
still
there
was
as
eager
as
minna
to
hear
the
results
of
granniss
errands
in
new
york
but
not
until
after
luncheon
when
the
three
were
alone
in
the
library
did
he
tell
the
whole
story
he
then
gave
a
frank
account
of
the
detective
s
asking
to
take
charge
of
the
package
of
money
and
of
the
lucky
stroke
it
was
that
he
did
so
but
i
never
imagined
rodney
said
that
he
would
send
it
along
by
a
messenger
on
the
same
train
clever
work
said
north
now
mrs
varian
have
you
a
really
good
safe
yes
i
have
my
husband
had
it
sent
up
here
with
our
trunks
it
looks
like
a
wardrobe
trunk
but
it
is
a
modern
and
secure
the
safe
was
in
a
closet
in
the
library
and
as
the
men
examined
it
they
agreed
that
it
was
a
good
safe
and
proof
against
even
a
most
skilful
burglar
unless
he
carries
it
off
suggested
north
it
s
not
very
but
it
s
very
heavy
minna
said
and
besides
it
s
clamped
to
the
they
put
the
parcel
of
money
in
the
safe
tucked
it
well
back
behind
less
important
matters
and
minna
herself
closed
the
door
i
ll
use
the
same
combination
fred
used
she
said
nobody
on
earth
knows
it
but
keep
it
to
yourself
mrs
varian
north
counseled
her
a
secret
shared
is
no
i
m
not
afraid
to
trust
you
two
minna
returned
but
i
won
t
tell
any
one
you
ve
had
no
further
communication
from
the
kidnappers
asked
granniss
i
have
she
said
a
letter
came
in
this
morning
s
mail
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
about
it
it
s
so
strange
yet
feel
a
positive
conviction
that
i
ought
to
do
as
they
tell
whatever
they
ask
i
beg
of
you
not
to
decide
until
mr
wise
gets
here
rodney
said
earnestly
since
i
have
seen
him
i
know
he
will
help
us
and
i
feel
sure
that
he
would
disapprove
of
your
going
ahead
with
this
until
he
can
advise
what
do
they
ask
you
to
do
north
inquired
that
is
if
you
care
to
tell
oh
i
m
glad
to
tell
you
and
see
what
you
think
i
know
it
might
be
a
better
plan
to
wait
for
mr
wise
s
arrival
but
that
may
scare
off
these
people
and
lose
me
my
one
and
only
chance
to
meet
their
demands
my
betty
where
s
the
letter
asked
granniss
looking
very
serious
minna
handed
him
a
paper
and
the
two
men
read
it
at
the
same
time
this
is
your
one
and
only
chance
to
get
back
your
daughter
unless
you
obey
these
directions
exactly
and
secretly
you
have
no
chance
at
all
at
midnight
tonight
take
the
packet
of
money
if
you
have
it
and
drop
it
over
the
cliff
into
the
sea
first
you
must
place
it
in
a
light
pasteboard
box
that
is
too
large
for
it
this
will
insure
its
floating
until
we
can
pick
it
up
now
if
you
have
told
any
one
of
this
and
if
there
is
any
boat
on
the
sea
at
that
time
we
will
not
carry
out
our
plans
the
money
will
be
lost
and
your
daughter
will
be
killed
so
take
your
choice
of
acting
in
good
faith
or
losing
your
child
forever
we
are
desperately
in
earnest
and
this
is
your
one
and
only
chance
if
you
fear
to
go
to
the
cliff
s
edge
alone
you
may
take
a
companion
but
only
one
who
is
in
your
faith
and
confidence
if
you
breathe
a
word
to
the
police
we
shall
know
of
it
and
we
will
call
off
all
our
arrangements
it
is
up
to
there
was
no
signature
the
paper
and
typing
were
like
those
of
the
previous
letter
from
the
same
source
and
the
tenor
of
the
letter
seemed
to
be
an
ultimatum
don
t
think
of
it
for
a
minute
urged
granniss
you
are
simply
throwing
away
a
large
sum
of
money
and
you
can
not
possibly
get
any
return
if
the
thing
were
genuine
if
it
were
from
real
kidnappers
who
really
had
betty
they
would
have
given
you
a
sign
a
proof
that
they
have
her
they
would
have
enclosed
a
scrap
of
her
handwriting
or
some
such
thing
that
telegram
is
of
course
a
fake
this
letter
proves
it
north
looked
dubious
you
may
be
right
granniss
he
said
perhaps
you
are
but
can
t
help
thinking
there
may
be
some
way
to
foil
these
people
suppose
mrs
varian
throws
a
faked
packet
over
the
no
granniss
declared
that
would
do
no
wait
a
minute
north
went
on
then
we
could
have
a
swift
motor
boat
hidden
in
the
shadows
and
follow
the
boat
that
picks
it
up
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
will
come
for
the
money
in
a
motor
of
course
they
ll
do
that
rod
agreed
but
it
will
be
a
boat
more
powerful
than
any
we
have
around
anyway
broke
in
minna
i
won
t
play
them
false
i
shall
either
follow
their
instructions
in
good
faith
or
not
do
it
at
all
i
m
sure
if
i
try
to
fool
them
they
ll
take
it
out
on
she
began
to
cry
and
north
said
hastily
don
t
let
me
influence
you
mrs
varian
you
must
do
just
as
you
please
in
the
matter
if
you
feel
that
the
mere
chance
of
getting
betty
by
such
means
is
sufficient
to
justify
your
equal
chance
of
losing
all
that
money
must
follow
your
own
minna
varian
sat
for
several
moments
in
deep
thought
then
she
said
quietly
i
ve
made
up
my
mind
i
shall
not
do
this
thing
tonight
i
am
more
influenced
by
rodney
s
remark
about
the
telegram
than
anything
else
as
he
says
if
these
people
really
had
betty
they
would
send
a
note
in
her
writing
and
not
a
that
s
the
way
to
look
at
it
mrs
varian
cried
granniss
much
pleased
at
her
logical
decision
the
telegram
was
a
mistake
on
their
part
to
begin
with
if
betty
is
closely
confined
which
she
must
be
if
there
s
any
truth
at
all
in
this
matter
how
could
she
get
out
to
send
a
telegram
and
if
they
sent
it
for
her
not
a
note
that
s
all
true
said
north
thoughtfully
and
when
mr
wise
gets
here
he
can
doubtless
discern
the
real
truth
of
it
all
the
money
will
be
all
right
in
the
safe
over
night
and
tomorrow
the
detective
can
look
after
it
then
you
re
decided
mrs
varian
i
m
decided
for
the
present
she
smiled
a
little
but
i
don
t
say
i
won
t
change
my
mind
it
s
a
terrible
temptation
to
do
as
they
bid
me
even
if
it
proves
a
false
north
went
away
and
poor
minna
spent
the
rest
of
that
day
in
alternate
decisions
for
and
against
the
directions
of
the
kidnappers
granniss
tried
his
best
to
dissuade
her
from
what
he
deemed
a
foolish
deed
to
begin
with
he
argued
i
can
t
believe
in
kidnappers
how
could
they
have
abducted
betty
in
broad
daylight
with
half
a
dozen
people
looking
for
her
to
come
out
of
the
house
i
don
t
know
said
poor
minna
dejectedly
but
oh
rodney
it
doesn
t
mean
anything
to
ask
such
questions
as
that
for
how
could
any
other
thing
happen
i
mean
how
do
you
explain
betty
s
disappearance
without
being
kidnapped
any
more
easily
than
by
such
means
how
explain
fred
s
death
how
explain
anything
now
the
only
chance
the
letter
says
this
plan
of
theirs
shall
i
try
it
look
at
it
this
way
mrs
varian
granniss
said
at
last
suppose
you
throw
that
money
over
the
cliff
it
s
by
no
means
certain
that
they
will
retrieve
it
but
that
s
their
business
it
s
full
moon
now
and
at
twelve
o
clock
the
sea
will
be
bright
as
day
there
ll
be
no
spying
boat
around
at
that
hour
and
they
will
watch
the
box
fall
get
it
quickly
and
go
away
then
they
will
send
betty
back
minna
s
face
always
lighted
up
with
a
happy
radiance
when
she
spoke
of
the
return
of
betty
but
think
a
minute
suppose
by
some
chance
they
don
t
get
the
money
there
is
some
stray
boat
out
at
that
hour
suppose
the
parcel
gets
caught
on
the
way
it
can
t
if
i
drop
it
right
down
from
the
overhang
and
i
d
have
you
to
protect
and
watch
over
my
own
safety
rodney
i
do
it
and
so
despite
granniss
dissuasion
in
defiance
of
her
own
misgivings
as
to
the
genuineness
of
the
anonymous
bargainers
the
poor
distracted
mother
made
up
her
mind
to
take
the
slim
chance
of
recovering
her
lost
child
by
the
desperate
method
offered
her
but
an
unforeseen
difficulty
prevented
her
shortly
before
midnight
the
sky
clouded
over
and
became
entirely
black
a
terrific
thunderstorm
followed
and
when
that
was
over
the
whole
heavens
remained
darkened
and
a
drizzling
rain
kept
up
it
s
out
of
the
question
granniss
said
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
it
s
still
raining
it
s
pitch
dark
nobody
could
see
a
parcel
dropped
over
the
cliffs
and
you
might
lose
your
own
life
in
the
process
but
let
this
comfort
you
if
these
people
are
really
the
kidnappers
they
will
give
you
another
chance
they
won
t
lose
their
chance
of
a
fortune
for
a
rainstorm
and
they
ll
communicate
with
you
that
s
probably
true
rod
and
minna
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
as
she
gazed
out
of
the
window
at
the
rain
and
so
let
s
go
to
rest
and
try
to
hope
for
a
future
mrs
fletcher
was
waiting
to
put
her
patient
to
bed
and
was
much
displeased
at
her
late
hour
of
retiring
so
little
was
said
by
either
of
the
women
and
at
last
with
a
curt
good
night
the
nurse
went
away
to
her
own
room
and
minna
closed
the
door
between
but
she
could
not
sleep
she
was
restless
and
nervous
at
last
she
began
to
worry
over
the
safety
of
the
money
in
the
safe
she
imagined
the
thwarted
kidnappers
disappointed
at
the
collapse
of
their
plans
coming
up
to
the
house
to
rob
her
of
the
money
they
had
reason
to
suppose
she
had
in
her
possession
to
her
anxious
and
worried
mind
it
seemed
the
money
would
be
safer
up
in
her
own
room
than
down
in
the
library
safe
on
a
sudden
impulse
she
determined
to
go
down
stairs
and
get
it
she
donned
dressing
gown
and
slippers
and
stealthily
not
to
awake
fletcher
she
crept
down
the
stairs
into
the
library
she
went
and
opening
the
closet
door
began
to
work
the
combination
that
unlocked
the
safe
absorbed
in
her
occupation
she
did
not
hear
a
slight
noise
behind
her
but
suddenly
a
voice
said
softly
oh
it
s
you
ma
am
i
thought
it
was
a
robber
minna
turned
quickly
to
see
martha
the
waitress
staring
at
her
as
she
already
had
the
safe
door
open
and
was
about
to
take
out
the
parcel
she
was
after
she
was
annoyed
at
any
interruption
martha
she
exclaimed
though
in
a
low
whisper
what
are
you
doing
here
go
back
to
bed
yes
ma
am
i
thought
i
heard
robbers
ma
no
it
s
only
i
have
to
see
about
some
important
papers
and
i
can
t
sleep
so
i
m
attending
to
it
now
go
back
to
your
room
at
once
yes
ma
am
and
the
girl
obeyed
drawing
a
sigh
of
relief
minna
took
her
precious
parcel
shut
the
safe
and
went
softly
back
to
her
own
room
she
put
the
package
beneath
her
mattress
locked
her
bedroom
door
and
soon
fell
asleep
worn
out
with
weariness
and
exhaustion
great
doin
s
grumbled
the
cook
as
martha
who
shared
her
room
returned
to
it
where
you
been
hush
up
said
martha
i
heard
a
noise
and
i
thought
it
was
and
you
went
downstairs
exclaimed
hannah
why
what
foolishness
they
might
a
shot
you
there
wasn
t
any
martha
explained
it
was
mrs
varian
poking
about
in
her
the
pore
leddy
said
hannah
sympathetically
she
can
t
sleep
at
all
at
all
the
nurse
tells
me
she
lies
awake
nearly
all
night
and
only
gets
forty
winks
in
the
morning
after
well
she
was
a
bit
upset
at
my
coming
in
said
martha
i
wouldn
t
a
gone
only
i
thought
it
was
my
oh
you
and
your
duty
growled
the
cook
i
m
thinkin
your
duty
is
to
keep
quiet
and
let
me
get
a
bit
of
sleep
myself
i
can
t
do
without
it
as
you
and
the
missus
can
hannah
grunted
as
she
turned
over
and
promptly
went
to
sleep
again
while
martha
who
was
both
imaginative
and
curious
of
mind
lay
awake
wondering
what
fearful
things
had
happened
or
would
happen
to
this
strange
house
the
girl
was
of
a
fearless
nature
but
deeply
interested
in
the
mysterious
and
had
more
than
once
made
investigations
herself
in
an
effort
to
find
some
secret
passage
such
as
the
family
were
continually
discussing
but
she
had
found
nothing
and
now
still
unable
to
sleep
she
occupied
her
mind
in
trying
to
form
some
new
theory
of
the
tragedies
of
headland
house
hannah
awakened
in
the
morning
by
reason
of
the
alarm
sounding
from
her
bedroom
clock
my
goodness
she
growled
to
herself
seems
like
i
d
only
just
dropped
to
sleep
well
ve
got
to
get
up
hey
martha
come
along
my
but
no
response
came
from
the
other
bed
and
hannah
stepped
across
the
room
to
give
the
girl
an
arousing
shake
why
heaven
bless
us
she
ain
t
here
exclaimed
the
startled
cook
now
don
t
that
beat
all
not
content
with
rampoosin
round
the
house
in
the
night
she
must
be
up
and
off
early
in
the
mornin
she
thinks
she
s
able
to
help
them
as
has
the
detective
work
in
charge
that
martha
hannah
proceeded
to
make
her
toilet
and
then
descended
the
back
stairs
to
the
kitchen
but
on
reaching
the
kitchen
she
gave
voice
to
such
a
scream
as
could
be
heard
by
all
the
servants
in
the
house
and
even
penetrated
to
the
rooms
occupied
by
minna
and
her
nurse
whatever
is
the
matter
cried
fletcher
running
out
to
the
hall
in
her
night
clothes
matter
enough
hannah
called
back
will
you
get
mr
granniss
and
tell
him
to
come
quick
stunned
by
the
cook
s
voice
and
manner
the
nurse
hurriedly
knocked
at
rodney
s
door
and
he
responded
at
once
he
was
partly
dressed
and
finishing
a
hasty
toilet
he
ran
down
stairs
he
found
hannah
and
kelly
the
butler
gazing
at
a
huddled
heap
on
the
kitchen
floor
which
he
saw
at
once
was
the
dead
body
of
martha
the
waitress
what
does
it
mean
he
asked
in
an
awed
voice
who
did
it
who
indeed
sir
hannah
said
whimpering
like
a
child
oh
mr
granniss
sir
do
get
mrs
varian
to
go
away
from
this
accursed
house
nobody
is
safe

as

kelly

day
it
s
curst
indeed
is
this
place
oh
martha
me
little
girl
could
a
done
this
to
ye
going
nearer
rodney
looked
at
the
body
touched
it
and
felt
for
the
girl
s
heart
there
was
no
heartbeat
and
the
cold
flesh
proved
her
death
took
place
some
hours
since
what
do
you
know
about
it
he
asked
the
cook
not
a
thing
sir
martha
was
down
stairs
late
last
night
and
she
came
up
again
saying
mrs
varian
was
down
in
the
mrs
varian
down
stairs
at
what
time
was
this
long
about
one
o
clock
sir
then
me
and
martha
both
went
to
sleep
i
did
and
that
s
all
i
knew
till
morning
then
i
went
to
call
the
girl
to
get
up
and
her
bed
was
empty
i
came
here
i
throwing
her
apron
over
her
face
hannah
rocked
back
and
forth
in
her
chair
rodney
forced
himself
to
think
give
orders
hannah
he
said
i
m
sorry
but
we
mustn
t
touch
martha
you
ll
have
to
get
breakfast
the
i
can
t
can
t
get
the
breakfast
with
that
poor
dead
girl
i
loved
that
young
one
like
she
was
my
but
hannah
remember
your
duty
to
mrs
varian
now
we
ll
lay
a
coverlet
over
martha
and
you
and
kelly
between

must
prepare
the
coffee
and
such
things
as
mrs
varian
wants

brave
now
for
there
s
enough
sorrow
for
mrs
varian
to
bear
you
and
kelly
must
do
whatever
you
can
to
then
rodney
looked
hastily
at
all
the
doors
and
windows
finding
them
all
securely
fastened
as
they
always
were
at
night
thank
goodness
wise
is
coming
today
he
thought
as
he
went
to
telephone
for
sheriff
potter
again
potter
summoned
he
turned
his
mind
to
the
question
of
how
best
to
tell
the
news
to
minna
and
concluded
to
tell
nurse
fletcher
first
she
came
down
then
greatly
excited
to
learn
what
had
happened
granniss
told
her
and
then
said
now
mrs
fletcher
i
beg
of
you
don
t
threaten
to
leave
mrs
varian
needs
you
now
more
than
ever
and
as
mr
wise
the
great
detective
is
coming
today
i
m
sure
you
need
not
be
afraid
to
stay
very
well
fletcher
returned
primly
i
know
my
duty
and
i
propose
to
do
it
i
will
stay
with
mrs
varian
until
she
can
get
some
one
else
until
i
can
get
some
one
else
for
her
not
an
hour
longer
how
did
the
maid
die
i
don
t
know
exactly
rodney
looked
puzzled
i
didn
t
think
it
best
to
touch
the
body
except
to
convince
myself
that
she
is
really
dead
now
will
you
tell
mrs
varian
or
shall
i
i
ll
tell
her
i
d
like
you
to
stand
so
taking
minna
s
breakfast
tray
quite
as
usual
the
nurse
went
back
to
her
patient
you
needn
t
tell
me
was
the
greeting
she
received
i
overheard
enough
to
know
what
has
happened
it
s
awful
i
suppose
it
s
only
the
beginning
of
a
further
string
of
the
utter
hopelessness
of
the
white
face
alarmed
granniss
more
than
a
hysterical
outburst
would
have
done
now
mrs
varian
he
said
consolingly
it
is
an
awful
occurrence
but
in
comparison
with
your
nearer
sorrows
it
means
little
to
you
try
not
to
think
about
it
leave
it
to
us
and
trust
me
to
do
all
that
is
necessary
or
potter
arrived
then
and
granniss
went
down
to
receive
him
another
the
sheriff
exclaimed
what
devil
s
work
is
going
on
here
any
way
he
went
to
the
kitchen
and
knelt
beside
the
dead
girl
strangled
he
said
briefly
after
an
examination
choked
to
death
by
a
strong
pair
of
man
s
hands
mr
granniss
i
accuse
you
of
the
murder
of
this
girl
chapter
x
pennington
wise
granniss
looked
at
the
constable
blankly
then
he
said
oh
well
you
may
as
well
accuse
me
as
anybody
for
the
present
where
s
dunn
he
s
coming
replied
potter
angry
at
the
young
man
s
indifference
to
his
charge
but
you
can
t
treat
this
matter
so
scornfully
mr
granniss
i
ve
been
thinking
a
whole
lot
about
you
in
connection
with
all
these
mysteries
up
here
and
i
m
of
the
opinion
you
know
more
about
some
things
than
you
quite
right
i
do
said
rod
cheerfully
but
don
t
arrest
me
just
yet
for
a
really
worth
while
detective
is
coming
this
morning
and
he
may
disagree
with
your
conclusions
but
this
is
a
bad
thing
this
poor
girl
i
can
t
understand
i
can
and
potter
looked
straight
at
him
you
found
her
in
your
way
put
her
out
of
oh
come
now
sheriff
this
from
bill
dunn
who
had
come
hurrying
in
don
t
go
off
you
haven
t
any
evidence
against
mr
granniss
except
that
he
was
in
the
i
will
have
though
potter
muttered
where
s
the
butler
here
i
am
and
kelly
put
in
his
appearance
who
saw
this
girl
last
potter
thundered
glaring
round
at
the
assembled
members
of
the
household
they
were
all
present
for
nurse
fletcher
had
been
unable
to
resist
her
aroused
curiosity
and
minna
varian
too
stood
in
the
background
composed
and
quiet
but
evidently
holding
herself
together
by
a
strong
effort
of
i
did
said
hannah
who
stood
silent
and
grim
with
folded
arms
watching
the
sheriff
where
was
she
then
in
her
bed
night
after
midnight
she
had
been
down
stairs
after
midnight
yes
she
heard
somebody
down
stairs
was
a
brave
one
she
thought
it
was
robbers
in
the
house
and
she
went
down
to
well
well
it
was
mrs
varian
who
had
gone
down
to
the
library
so
martha
came
up
again
leaving
mrs
varian
down
there
yes
minna
interrupted
leaving
me
down
what
were
you
doing
mrs
varian
i
was
wakeful
and
i
went
down
to
the
library
to
look
over
some
and
this
girl
came
to
you
there
tell
the
story
in
your
own
there
s
little
to
tell
i
was
startled
at
martha
s
unexpected
appearance
and
sent
her
back
to
her
room
shortly
afterward
i
went
back
to
my
own
room
that
is
then
martha

have
come
down
stairs

is
quite
evident
said
minna
looking
sorrowfully
at
the
dead
girl
oh
mr
potter

will
take
a
lot
of
clearing
up

where

this
time
kelly

the
third
story
and
i
sleep
very
humph
you
do
well
how
about
the
doors
and
windows
i
suppose
they
were
locked
and
barred
as
usual
yes
they
were
asserted
kelly
i
always
look
after
those
then
there
was
no
way
for
an
intruder
to
get
in
this
house
last
night
between
midnight
say
and
morning
no
way
sir
assented
kelly
then
this
girl
was
murdered
by
either
you
kelly
or
by
mr
granniss
those
marks
on
her
throat
of
a
strangling
hold
were
made
by
a
man
by
a
strong
man
either
of
you
two
could
have
done
it
which
one
did
not
i
sir
kelly
denied
as
calmly
as
if
he
were
merely
refuting
a
slight
accusation
i
know
nothing
about
i
don
t
believe
you
do
said
potter
judicially
but
i
do
think
you
re
implicated
mr
granniss
were
you
in
your
room
all
night
of
course
i
was
i
retired
about
one
o
clock
and
i
didn
t
open
my
door
again
until
i
was
summoned
this
morning
to
learn
of
martha
s
you
say
that
glibly
enough
it
will
take
some
no
your
denial
of
it
or
suspicion
of
my
veracity
will
take
the
proof
can
you
produce
it
you
re
not
wise
to
be
so
cocksure
sir
there
is
such
a
thing
as
elimination
and
i
say
that
only
you
could
have
done
this
thing
the
women
are
not
capable
of
such
a
deed
and
i
ve
no
reason
to
suspect
and
just
what
is
your
reason
for
suspecting
me
rodney
s
eyes
were
beginning
to
grow
stern
and
his
jaw
set
firmly
also
what
evidence
have
you
for
your
suspicions
come
off
potter
bill
dunn
warned
him
you
ain
t
got
no
real
evidence
against
mr
granniss
and
you
d
better
go
easy
to
my
mind
mr
granniss
ain
t
going
to
kill
a
servant
girl
without
a
good
he
may
have
a
very
good
reason
suppose
mr
granniss
was
at
the
safe
and
suppose
martha
surprised
him
there
as
she
had
startled
mrs
varian
and
suppose
mr
granniss
didn
t
want
it
known
that
he
had
been
there
so
he
took
the
only
sure
method
of
silencing
her
and
what
would
mr
granniss
be
doing
at
the
safe
asked
dunn
well
i
happen
to
know
that
there
was
considerable
of
value
in
that
safe
last
rodney
started
how
did
the
sheriff
know
that
but
he
said
this
is
aside
the
mark
mr
potter
for
mrs
varian
has
trusted
me
with
the
combination
of
the
safe
i
can
open
it
at
any
time
without
let
or
hindrance
why
then
should
i
sneak
down
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
do
so
for
the
very
good
reason
that
you
wanted
to
take
the
money
that
was
there
and
make
off
with
and
did
i
get
it
i
should
say
not
declared
potter
since
you
are
still
here
he
looked
proud
of
this
triumph
of
deduction
and
went
on
you
had
some
valuables
in
that
safe
last
night
mrs
varian
did
you
not
yes
replied
minna
almost
smiling
at
the
trend
of
the
questions
are
they
there
now
no
they
are
aha
what
did
i
tell
you
but
they
are
not
there
because
when
i
visited
the
library
late
last
night
i
took
them
away
to
my
room
for
better
protection
of
oh
potter
looked
deeply
chagrined
you
have
them
safe
then
oh
yes
quite
safe
thank
well
all
the
same
went
on
the
sheriff
doggedly
mr
granniss
thought
they
were
there
and
went
down
to
steal
maybe
martha
was
there
on
the
same
errand
said
dunn
thoughtfully
don
t
you
dare
say
a
word
against
that
pore
dead
child
cried
hannah
resenting
at
once
any
aspersion
of
her
friend
she
would
never
dream
of
such
a
what
did
she
come
down
for
then
asked
potter
she
had
been
down
and
had
spoken
to
mrs
varian
then
she
returned
to
her
room
you
say
and
went
back
to
bed
now
why
did
she
go
down
again
that
i
do
not
know
hannah
said
belligerently
but
it
was
for
no
wrong
purpose
maybe
she
thought
again
she
heard
burglars
and
maybe
time
she
was
not
that
would
be
a
fine
theory
potter
observed
but
for
the
fact
that
a
burglar
couldn
t
get
in
or
out
so
if
she
heard
any
one
prowling
about
it
must
have
been
some
member
of
the
household
isn
t
she
a
very
daring
young
person
she
was
afraid
of
nothing
hannah
stated
she
was
great
for
detective
stories
and
she
was
crazy
to
investigate
and
inquire
into
all
the
goin
s
on
of
this
terrible
house
martha
was
a
dabster
at
puzzles
she
was
terrible
and
sensed
out
a
ferret
i
never
saw
her
beat
at
findin
out
things
that
would
explain
why
an
if
there
was
one
would
put
her
out
of
the
way
rather
than
have
her
live
to
tell
of
his
all
right
sir
hannah
conceded
if
so
be
s
you
put
it
that
way
but
don
t
you
accuse
that
innocent
girl
of
any
wrongdoings
herself
for
she
never
did
it
does
look
that
way
rodney
said
thoughtfully
if
martha
had
that
investigating
proclivity
that
would
explain
her
reappearance
down
stairs
is
if
there
was
a
burglar
how
could
there
be
one
as
usual
we
re
reasoning
round
in
a
circle
now
mr
potter
i
think
your
conclusions
are
logical
and
probable
except
in
so
far
as
they
drag
me
into
this
thing
i
didn
t
leave
my
room
last
night
at
all
but
i
shall
be
at
your
disposal
any
time
you
want
to
question
me
further
on
the
subject
now
i
want
to
go
to
the
library
and
attend
to
my
daily
routine
of
business
matters
also
mr
wise
will
arrive
before
noon
and
perhaps
his
skill
may
be
helpful
to
your
shortly
before
noon
pennington
wise
did
arrive
he
brought
with
him
a
strange
almost
weird
little
girl
creature
who
ran
up
the
steps
and
into
the
house
before
him
granniss
had
opened
the
door
to
them
and
after
greeting
wise
he
turned
to
the
girl
my
assistant
wise
said
carelessly
name
zizi
give
her
over
to
the
housekeeper
she
ll
take
care
of
herself
where
s
the
living
room
quite
apparently
tired
from
the
steep
walk
up
the
cliff
wise
sank
into
a
chair
that
rodney
placed
for
him
they
stayed
in
the
hall
which
was
large
and
square
and
was
often
used
as
a
sitting
room
zizi
however
dropping
her
bag
in
the
hall
darted
toward
the
dining
room
and
thence
to
the
kitchen
oh
she
cried
to
hannah
are
you
the
cook
do
give
me
some
tea
and
toast
or
something
m
famished
my
heavens
who
s
that
zizi
bent
over
the
dead
girl
whose
body
still
lay
on
the
kitchen
floor
martha
was
clad
only
in
a
kimono
over
her
nightdress
and
wore
bedroom
slippers
but
no
stockings
hopped
out
of
bed
and
ran
down
suddenly
didn
t
she
commented
the
strange
girl
didn
t
even
stop
to
pin
up
her
hair
must
have
heard
somebody
that
she
was
pretty
sure
was
burglaring
or
she
wouldn
t
have
run
down
again
on
the
chance
of
its
being
mrs
varian
the
second
how
do
you
know
all
about
it
asked
hannah
aghast
at
the
remarkable
person
that
had
invaded
her
kitchen
but
you
re
right
martha
was
too
cute
to
be
caught
in
a
mistake
twice
must
have
been
sure
it
was
not
mrs
varian
again
your
chauffeur
who
met
us
at
the
train
told
us
about
this
poor
zizi
s
black
eyes
snapped
as
she
delicately
touched
the
awful
bruises
on
martha
s
throat
small
doubt
what
did
for
her
brute
kneeling
down
she
ran
her
tiny
fingers
lightly
over
the
body
and
finally
scrutinized
the
hands
look
hannah
she
said
quietly
and
held
open
the
left
hand
it
showed
a
dark
green
streak
of
some
sort
that
spread
entirely
across
the
palm
paint
asked
hannah
not
specially
interested
our
porch
chairs
have
been
painted
lately
i
don
t
see
how
she
got
out
on
the
porch
though
o
course
she
could
a
done
so
that
just
then
potter
and
bill
dunn
returned
and
said
they
were
ready
to
take
the
body
of
the
girl
down
to
the
village
where
her
parents
lived
and
a
good
job
to
get
it
out
of
this
house
said
dunn
i
tell
you
potter
poor
martha
s
death
has
nothin
to
do
with
those
other
horrors
up
here
and
mrs
varian
has
all
she
can
stagger
under
without
the
extra
sorrow
and
trouble
of
a
servant
wait
commanded
zizi
for
her
ringing
tone
was
nothing
less
than
commanding
wait
till
mr
wise
sees
this
she
ran
for
the
detective
who
came
at
once
the
sheriff
gazed
with
eager
curiosity
at
the
great
city
detective
and
sniffed
to
see
that
he
was
a
mere
human
being
after
all
he
saw
only
a
well
set
up
man
with
chestnut
hair
brushed
back
from
a
broad
forehead
and
sharp
blue
eyes
that
were
kindly
of
expression
but
keen
of
observation
but
the
astute
bill
dunn
saw
more
than
this
he
recognized
the
air
of
efficiency
the
subtle
hint
of
power
the
whole
effect
of
generalship
which
fairly
emanated
from
this
man
there
was
no
bustle
about
pennington
wise
no
but
to
those
blessed
with
perceptions
he
gave
an
instant
impression
of
sure
reasoning
and
inerrant
judgment
he
glanced
quickly
at
zizi
caught
the
almost
imperceptible
motion
of
her
own
little
bird
claw
of
a
hand
and
then
without
seeming
to
notice
her
at
all
he
spoke
genially
to
the
two
men
and
nodded
sympathetically
at
the
cook
and
they
all
liked
him
if
asked
why
they
could
not
have
told
but
his
manner
and
attitude
were
so
friendly
his
mien
so
inoffensive
and
his
cordial
acceptance
of
each
of
them
was
so
pleasant
that
he
was
instantly
in
their
good
graces
even
the
sheriff
who
had
been
fully
prepared
to
dislike
and
distrust
this
city
wizard
capitulated
gladly
and
was
ready
to
subscribe
to
all
his
theories
deductions
and
decisions
too
bad
wise
said
with
real
feeling
as
he
knelt
by
martha
s
side
and
few
could
have
seen
unmoved
the
bright
young
face
of
the
strong
healthy
girl
who
had
been
so
brutally
done
to
death
gently
he
lifted
her
chin
and
examined
the
black
bruises
on
her
throat
suggested
potter
eager
to
show
the
city
man
his
familiarity
with
modern
methods
hardly
wise
said
i
doubt
much
could
be
learned
that
way
bruise
is
so
deep
perhaps
there
may
be
prints
of
the
ruffian
s
hands
on
her
clothing
you
might
try
it
out
mr
then
while
the
two
men
were
speaking
to
each
other
about
the
matter
wise
unobtrusively
looked
at
the
inside
of
the
girl
s
hands
on
the
left
palm
he
saw
the
long
smear
of
dark
green
and
after
quick
but
careful
scrutiny
he
bent
lower
and
smelled
of
it
then
he
closed
the
dead
hand
and
rose
to
his
feet
you
may
take
away
the
body
sheriff
he
said
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
she
has
people
yes
sir
parents
and
sisters
oh
it
s
a
sorry
thing
for
it
is
so
and
then
wise
let
his
perceiving
eyes
roam
over
the
kitchen
have
you
searched
the
floor
well
for
anything
that
may
have
been
dropped
he
asked
oh
yes
the
sheriff
answered
that
s
all
been
done
mr
wise
we
re
plain
country
folks
here
but
we
know
a
thing
or
i
m
sure
of
that
wise
assented
did
you
look
under
the
dresser
and
beneath
that
corner
cupboard
well
no
we
didn
t
think
it
necessary
to
go
so
far
as
probably
not
most
likely
not
yet
i
wish
hannah
you
d
get
a
broom
and
just
run
it
under
i
ll
do
it
volunteered
kelly
who
had
come
to
the
kitchen
he
brought
a
broom
and
brushing
under
the
two
dressers
brought
out
some
dust
some
threads
and
shreds
and
two
yellow
beads
martha
s
asked
wise
quietly
picking
up
the
beads
no
exclaimed
hannah
staring
at
them
miss
betty
s
miss
varian
s
wise
was
himself
surprised
yes
sir
the
very
ones
she
wore
the
day
i
ll
take
charge
of
them
he
said
simply
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
kelly
and
his
broom
failed
to
find
anything
further
and
suddenly
realizing
the
side
light
it
gave
on
her
housekeeping
habits
hannah
began
to
explain
how
everything
was
going
at
sixes
and
sevens
of
late
of
course
it
would
zizi
soothed
her
as
wise
returned
to
the
hall
now
hannah
tell
me
did
you
find
anywhere
any
more
of
miss
betty
s
beads
i
found
two
when
i
was
sweepin
here
one
day
but
i
slipped
em
in
this
drawer
an
never
remembered
them
again
here
they
she
retrieved
the
two
beads
and
zizi
took
them
did
she
wear
a
long
string
of
them
no
miss
a
fairly
short
string
about
like
that
you
ve
on
zizi
s
modest
little
string
of
black
beads
hung
perhaps
four
inches
below
her
throat
she
examined
the
yellow
beads
saw
they
were
of
amber
and
put
them
away
in
her
little
handbag
now
hannah
she
went
on
you
and
i
are
an
that
i
m
proud
to
be
miss
and
you
must
help
me
all
you
help
you
what
find
out
the
truth
about
miss
betty
perhaps
are
you
yes
i
m
a
detective
is
i
m
the
assistant
of
mr
wise
and
he
s
the
greatest
detective
in
the
is
he
that
now
and
kelly
unable
to
resist
the
fascination
of
this
queer
visitor
joined
the
group
yes
he
is
and
he
is
going
to
solve
the
whole
mystery
we
all
help
and
maybe
we
ll
help
best
by
doing
nothing
and
especially
by
saying
nothing
so
you
two
keep
quite
still
about
finding
these
beads
won
t
you
and
about
matters
in
general
you
talk
over
things
with
the
villagers
i
suppose
but
don
t
say
anything
about
what
happens
up
here
now
discuss
the
past
all
you
like
but
not
the
present
see
they
didn
t
see
clearly
but
they
were
more
than
ready
to
promise
whatever
this
girl
asked
and
then
between
the
two
zizi
was
served
with
such
a
luncheon
as
might
have
befitted
a
royal
guest
goodness
gracious
sakes
alive
she
exclaimed
don
t
bring
me
anything
more
i
beg
of
you
i
shall
go
to
sleep
like
an
anaconda
and
not
wake
up
for
six
months
then
while
the
detective
ate
his
luncheon
at
the
table
with
minna
varian
and
her
secretary
zizi
went
in
search
of
the
nurse
she
found
mrs
fletcher
eating
her
meal
from
a
tray
in
her
sitting
room
it
hurt
her
pride
to
do
this
but
minna
varian
declared
that
she
saw
quite
enough
of
fletcher
between
meals
and
must
have
some
respite
nice
to
eat
alone
i
think
was
zizi
s
observation
as
she
entered
uninvited
and
perched
herself
on
the
arm
of
a
nearby
chair
you
re
fletcher
aren
t
you
now
won
t
you
please
tell
me
some
things
confidentially
i
see
you
re
a
woman
of
deep
perceptions
and
are
not
to
be
caught
napping
tell
me
do
you
think
mrs
varian
went
down
stairs
a
second
time
last
night
that
she
did
not
asserted
the
nurse
she
was
flattered
at
zizi
s
attitude
and
would
have
told
her
anything
she
asked
how
do
you
know
i
can
t
go
to
sleep
myself
you
see
till
mrs
varian
is
asleep
so
i
always
wait
until
i
hear
her
steady
breathing
before
i
let
myself
drop
the
statement
was
too
surely
true
to
be
disbelieved
and
zizi
went
on
then
who
was
it
that
martha
heard
downstairs
that
she
went
down
a
second
time
maybe
she
didn
t
hear
anybody
maybe
she
went
down
to
see
what
she
could
pick
up
steal
do
you
mean
oh
for
shame
to
accuse
a
poor
dead
girl
mrs
fletcher
looked
ashamed
i
oughtn
t
to
s
pose
but
miss
what
else
is
there
to
think
i
well
know
how
this
house
is
locked
up
of
nights
nobody
from
outside
could
get
in
the
other
servants
are
as
honest
as
the
day
and
though
i
ve
no
real
reason
to
suspect
martha
yet
there
doesn
t
seem
to
be
any
other
way
to
look
there
now
some
way
may
turn
up
said
zizi
tell
me
more
about
betty
i
can
t
tell
you
from
having
known
her
for
i
never
saw
the
girl
but
since
i
ve
been
taking
care
of
mrs
varian
there
s
little
i
don
t
know
about
the
whole
family
she
s
nervous
you
know
and
so
she
talks
incessantly
when
we
re
nothing
though
to
cast
any
light
on
miss
varian
s
disappearance
oh
no
nothing
but
sort
of
reminiscences
about
her
husband
and
how
good
he
was
to
her
and
how
she
grieves
for
him
for
her
child
poor
woman
s
fearful
to
hear
it
must
be
said
zizi
sympathetically
my
heart
bleeds
for
that
poor
tortured
chapter
xi
clues
it
was
after
luncheon
in
the
library
that
pennington
wise
began
his
real
business
of
the
investigation
of
the
varian
mysteries
first
of
all
he
desired
to
look
over
the
papers
in
mr
varian
s
desk
and
with
the
assistance
of
granniss
he
was
soon
in
possession
of
the
principal
facts
to
be
learned
that
way
moreover
he
discovered
some
things
not
yet
taken
into
consideration
by
the
local
detectives
and
he
read
with
interest
a
number
of
letters
that
were
carefully
filed
apparently
for
preservation
rapidly
he
scanned
them
and
tossed
them
aside
retaining
a
few
for
further
consideration
i
think
mrs
varian
he
said
at
last
that
a
most
important
fact
in
the
case
is
the
strange
bequest
of
the
varian
pearls
to
your
husband
s
niece
instead
of
to
his
daughter
can
you
explain
this
i
can
not
said
minna
it
seems
to
me
absolutely
unexplainable
for
generations
those
pearls
have
descended
from
parent
to
child
a
mother
owned
them
sometimes
a
father
but
they
were
always
given
to
the
oldest
daughter
or
if
there
were
no
daughter
then
to
a
son
only
in
case
of
a
childless
inheritor
did
they
go
to
a
niece
or
nephew
why
my
husband
should
so
definitely
bequeath
them
to
his
niece
can
not
imagine
i
ve
thought
over
that
for
hours
but
i
can
t
understand
it
i
will
say
frankly
that
betty
and
her
father
frequently
had
differences
of
opinion
but
nothing
more
than
many
families
have
they
were
really
devoted
to
one
another
but
both
were
of
decided
even
obstinate
nature
and
when
they
disagreed
they
were
apt
to
argue
the
matter
out
and
as
a
result
of
it
they
did
sometimes
lose
their
temper
and
really
quarreled
but
it
always
blew
over
quickly
and
they
were
good
friends
again
i
never
paid
any
attention
to
their
little
squabbles
for
i
knew
them
both
too
well
to
think
they
were
really
at
enmity
but
this
matter
of
the
pearls
looks
as
if
my
husband
had
a
positive
dislike
for
the
child
and
as
a
mark
of
spite
or
punishment
left
the
pearls
away
from
her
it
makes
little
difference
don
t
think
about
that
mrs
varian
said
wise
kindly
i
m
considering
this
strange
clause
of
mr
varian
s
will
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
whole
mystery
it
may
prove
a
clue
you
see
i
want
to
say
right
now
that
the
whole
affair
is
the
greatest
and
most
baffling
puzzle
i
have
ever
known
of
the
disappearance
of
your
daughter
and
the
death
of
your
husband
offer
no
solution
that
seems
to
me
possible
alone
probable
i
can
set
up
no
theory
that
does
not
include
a
secret
passage
of
some
sort
and
though
i
am
emphatically
informed
there
is
none
yet
as
you
may
imagine
i
must
investigate
that
for
i
ve
found
the
house
plans
said
a
low
thin
little
voice
and
the
strange
girl
zizi
appeared
in
the
room
that
slender
little
wisp
of
humanity
had
an
uncanny
way
of
being
present
and
absent
suddenly
and
without
explanation
she
was
there
and
then
she
wasn
t
there
her
goings
and
comings
were
so
noiseless
and
unobtrusive
that
they
were
never
noticed
pennington
wise
held
out
his
hand
without
a
word
zizi
gave
over
a
bulky
roll
of
papers
and
subsided
unrolling
the
sheets
they
saw
that
they
really
were
the
old
contractor
s
plans
of
the
house
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
wise
commenced
to
study
them
looking
over
his
shoulder
minna
sat
quietly
her
nervousness
lost
in
her
eager
anticipation
of
the
new
detective
s
successful
quest
the
two
men
studied
the
plans
carefully
i
wish
north
could
see
these
rodney
said
he
s
of
an
architectural
bent
mr
wise
and
he
measured
the
house
all
over
trying
to
find
an
unexplained
bit
of
space
according
to
these
plans
north
is
right
and
there
isn
t
i
m
of
an
architectural
bent
myself
wise
smiled
and
i
agree
there
s
no
foot
of
room
left
unaccounted
for
on
these
papers
of
course
a
secret
passage
could
have
been
built
in
in
contradiction
of
the
plans
but
i
can
t
think
there
is
any
such
after
your
own
search
it
might
be
but
we
would
have
seen
anyone
going
in
or
out
of
the
house
minna
explained
we
were
all
the
back
doors
there
s
only
one
rodney
told
him
and
that
was
locked
on
the
inside
locked
and
bolted
no
whatever
happened
nobody
came
in
through
the
do
you
assume
an
intruder
then
mr
wise
minna
asked
i
am
obliged
to
mrs
varian
to
begin
with
the
only
fact
we
can
positively
affirm
mr
varian
was
shot
not
by
his
own
hand
this
we
assume
because
of
the
absence
of
the
weapon
now
either
miss
betty
shot
him
or
someone
else
did
i
can
t
think
the
daughter
did
it
for
it
s
against
the
probabilities
in
every
way
of
course
it
s
a
possibility
but
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
explaining
what
the
girl
did
with
herself
afterward
seem
to
me
greater
than
the
objections
to
assuming
an
intruder
from
outside
i
mean
from
outside
the
family
from
outside
the
house
the
explanation
of
his
entrance
and
exit
is
no
more
of
a
puzzle
than
the
explanation
of
miss
varian
s
exit
and
i
think
we
must
dismiss
the
idea
that
the
girl
concealed
herself
in
this
house
alive
the
girl
didn
t
do
it
came
zizi
s
low
murmur
she
was
sitting
on
an
ottoman
near
minna
and
now
and
then
she
caressed
the
hand
of
her
hostess
there
s
a
big
mind
at
the
back
of
all
this
and
you
re
overlooking
the
death
of
the
maid
last
night
why
penny
it
s
all
of
a
yes
and
wise
roused
himself
from
a
brown
study
it
is
all
of
a
piece
and
it
hinges
on
that
bequest
of
the
varian
hinges
on
that
said
zizi
i
mean
that
s
a
key
to
the
situation
when
we
learn
mr
varian
made
that
strange
arrangement
we
ll
be
on
our
way
to
a
solution
of
the
mystery
but
the
first
thing
is
to
find
miss
oh
mr
wise
minna
cried
out
you
think
she
is
i
very
much
hope
so
and
though
i
don
t
want
to
give
you
false
encouragement
i
can
t
help
feeling
that
she
may
be
yes
she
is
came
zizi
s
quiet
assurance
and
minna
impulsively
kissed
her
what
a
comfort
you
are
she
exclaimed
elf
pixie
don
t
know
what
to
call
you
you
bring
me
courage
and
zizi
s
great
dark
eyes
gave
appreciation
but
she
only
said
you
re
up
against
it
i
am
indeed
wise
said
very
gravely
and
my
first
work
must
be
a
deep
investigation
of
all
mr
varian
s
affairs
you
were
entirely
in
his
confidence
mrs
varian
oh
yes
we
had
no
secrets
from
one
another
he
told
me
all
his
financial
ventures
or
business
worries
there
were
none
of
those
of
late
but
years
ago
there
were
some
yes
i
may
say
i
know
everything
that
ever
happened
to
my
then
who
has
been
blackmailing
him
of
late
and
what
for
blackmail
minna
looked
blank
never
such
a
thing
as
that
has
happened
to
my
husband
she
spoke
proudly
and
positively
you
know
of
no
one
who
had
a
hold
over
mr
varian
thought
he
had
who
wrote
him
threatening
letters
most
assuredly
not
and
i
know
that
nothing
of
the
sort
ever
did
occur
for
he
would
most
certainly
have
told
me
we
were
more
confidential
than
most
married
people
and
we
never
had
secrets
from
one
well
perhaps
i
am
what
made
you
think
it
asked
minna
curiously
if
you
have
found
any
letters
you
can
t
explain
show
them
to
me
can
doubtless
tell
you
about
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
wise
handed
her
a
letter
it
bore
neither
date
nor
address
but
it
read
unless
you
accede
to
my
demands
i
shall
expose
you
and
the
woman
you
robbed
will
claim
redress
or
return
of
her
this
brief
message
was
signed
and
minna
read
it
with
a
look
of
utter
perplexity
i
don
t
know
what
it
means
she
said
handing
it
back
but
i
m
sure
it
s
of
no
importance
mr
varian
never
robbed
a
woman
in
his
life
the
very
idea
is
too
absurd
to
consider
you
are
at
liberty
to
hunt
it
down
mr
wise
but
you
will
never
find
it
has
a
meaning
that
will
reflect
on
my
husband
s
stainless
honor
you
may
refer
to
any
of
his
friends
his
relatives
or
his
business
associates
all
will
tell
you
that
frederick
varian
and
dishonesty
are
contradictory
terms
that
may
all
be
true
mrs
varian
and
doubtless
is
true
but
you
know
blackmailers
are
not
so
scrupulous
and
they
sometimes
find
a
peg
to
hang
their
demands
on
even
in
the
case
of
the
most
upright
this
note
is
undated
but
the
envelope
shows
it
was
mailed
less
than
six
months
ago
therefore
the
matter
may
be
still
unsettled
and
may
have
a
bearing
on
the
whole
case
could
there
have
been
any
family
reason
that
would
influence
him
to
leave
the
pearls
away
from
his
daughter
oh
no
his
brother
and
were
quite
as
much
surprised
as
i
was
to
learn
of
that
but
mr
wise
what
do
you
think
about
this
matter
of
the
kidnappers
asking
for
ransom
do
you
think
it
is
all
a
fraud
i
m
going
to
look
into
that
as
soon
as
i
can
at
first
glance
it
seems
fraudulent
but
the
wonder
is
that
you
haven
t
had
similar
letters
from
other
fakers
however
i
am
going
to
work
backward
i
want
first
of
all
to
look
about
a
bit
for
evidences
or
clues
regarding
last
night
s
tragedy
i
am
sure
the
whole
string
of
horrors
is
a
connected
one
and
to
find
out
who
killed
poor
martha
will
in
my
opinion
be
a
to
the
solution
of
the
other
there
s
a
clue
for
you
then
zizi
said
not
moving
from
her
seat
but
pointing
to
a
spot
on
the
rug
near
the
safe
wise
s
eyes
followed
her
finger
s
direction
and
saw
a
slight
mark
as
of
a
dusty
footprint
in
a
moment
he
was
on
his
knees
near
it
and
scrutinized
it
carefully
i
ve
heard
of
footprint
clues
said
granniss
interested
but
that
is
so
vague
and
imperfect
i
don
t
think
you
can
deduce
who
made
it
you
not
from
the
print
wise
said
and
then
added
nothing
to
his
unsatisfactory
statement
he
then
took
a
from
the
desk
and
scraped
onto
a
bit
of
smooth
paper
what
dust
he
could
get
from
the
footprint
and
carefully
folded
it
up
and
put
it
in
his
pocketbook
what
shoes
were
you
wearing
when
you
visited
the
safe
last
night
mrs
varian
he
asked
bedroom
slippers
she
replied
had
you
walked
anywhere
except
to
traverse
the
halls
and
stairs
from
your
bedroom
down
here
no
nowhere
and
you
took
that
package
of
money
up
to
your
room
with
you
had
you
not
done
so
it
would
have
been
stolen
wise
said
calmly
a
thief
visited
this
safe
after
you
were
here
thought
the
money
was
here
he
was
surprised
by
the
maid
martha
coming
down
to
spy
on
him
in
order
to
get
rid
of
her
save
himself
he
strangled
all
present
stared
at
him
and
rodney
granniss
flushed
a
deep
red
to
a
disinterested
observer
mr
wise
he
said
it
might
easily
appear
that
i
was
that
thief
i
knew
the
money
had
been
put
in
the
safe
i
did
not
know
mrs
varian
had
removed
it
look
here
interrupted
zizi
you
talk
too
much
if
you
re
going
to
be
suspected
for
the
love
of
cheese
let
somebody
else
do
it
don
t
meet
trouble
half
way
and
sing
out
pleased
to
meetcha
be
careful
mr
hush
up
zizi
wise
counseled
her
children
should
be
seen
and
not
all
right
penny
i
ll
be
good
now
here
s
a
present
for
she
gave
him
the
yellow
beads
given
her
by
the
cook
divulge
he
said
briefly
as
he
stared
at
the
tiny
objects
in
his
palm
but
minna
varian
had
caught
sight
of
them
and
had
recognized
them
oh
she
cried
betty
those
are
the
beads
she
had
on
that
day
where
did
you
get
them
where
did
they
come
from
and
then
before
they
could
answer
her
her
nerves
gave
way
her
calm
broke
through
the
constraint
she
had
put
upon
it
and
she
became
hysterical
granniss
went
at
once
for
mrs
fletcher
and
the
nurse
took
her
patiently
away
she
ll
be
all
right
with
fletcher
rodney
said
returning
after
he
had
assisted
minna
to
her
room
it
won
t
be
a
very
bad
attack
nurse
thinks
really
i
ve
been
surprised
that
mrs
varian
has
kept
up
as
well
as
she
has
now
mr
wise
tell
me
what
you
suspect
regarding
mr
varian
and
also
tell
me
if
you
suspect
any
way
i
plead
not
guilty
i
want
to
add
that
miss
varian
and
i
are
sweethearts
we
couldn
t
call
it
an
engagement
for
her
father
wouldn
t
hear
of
such
a
thing
but
we
hoped
to
persuade
him
in
time
truly
i
thought
he
would
finally
consent
i
m
telling
you
this
so
you
can
see
what
a
deep
interest
i
have
in
the
recovery
of
betty
i
am
not
willing
to
believe
she
is
dead
in
fact
i
believe
she
has
been
kidnapped
and
though
i
m
not
sure
those
letters
mrs
varian
has
received
are
in
good
faith
i
believe
she
is
being
held
for
by
whom
asked
wise
by
the
who
also
is
blackmailer
said
zizi
in
an
awestruck
voice
oh
penny
wise
how
you
do
jump
at
a
solution
you
just
clear
all
intervening
obstacles
and
land
on
the
truth
i
m
far
from
having
landed
said
wise
ruefully
that
s
all
theory
very
little
fact
to
back
it
well
these
beads
are
facts
zizi
said
they
re
two
more
penny
from
the
same
string
that
you
already
have
a
few
from
you
see
mr
granniss
she
said
turning
to
rod
mr
wise
discovered
a
few
of
these
beads
in
the
kitchen
this
morning
and
a
little
later
i
found
that
the
cook
had
picked
up
two
in
the
kitchen
the
day
after
miss
betty
s
disappearance
the
string
of
them
that
she
wore
was
not
a
long
one
but
still
there
were
at
least
a
dozen
or
so
more
than
we
have
found
where
are
they
she
had
turned
again
to
wise
as
she
put
this
question
i
know
the
beads
well
granniss
said
but
how
did
they
get
in
the
kitchen
it
may
be
a
simple
matter
wise
responded
perhaps
the
string
broke
when
she
was
out
there
getting
the
lemonade
i
understand
all
the
servants
were
but
penny
zizi
reminded
him
in
that
case
the
other
beads
would
be
about
somewhere
she
would
have
picked
them
up
and
put
them
in
a
box
or
yes
she
would
rodney
agreed
for
betty
loved
that
necklace
she
loved
anything
yellow
you
ve
heard
about
the
yellow
pillow
no
said
wise
do
try
mr
granniss
to
tell
me
everything
i
was
called
to
this
case
altogether
too
late
much
could
have
been
done
had
i
been
here
sooner
but
now
tell
me
every
little
thing
you
can
think
so
granniss
told
them
of
the
finding
of
the
yellow
satin
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
floor
he
obtained
the
pillow
from
the
hall
and
showed
it
to
them
zizi
scrutinized
it
with
her
eager
black
eyes
and
carefully
extracted
from
its
embroidered
design
a
small
fine
hairpin
an
invisible
she
said
holding
it
up
to
the
light
betty
s
daresay
yes
and
granniss
looked
at
it
she
wore
dinky
little
ones
like
that
in
her
front
hair
all
girls
do
i
it
may
mean
something
or
nothing
wise
said
musingly
if
miss
varian
was
in
the
habit
of
lying
on
the
hall
sofa
the
hairpin
may
have
been
caught
in
the
cushion
some
time
i
don
t
know
granniss
said
i
never
was
here
betty
was
well
aside
from
the
hairpin
what
about
the
yellow
pillow
on
the
kitchen
floor
penny
zizi
asked
looking
up
into
the
detective
s
face
as
at
an
oracle
it
s
a
clue
all
right
wise
said
oh
if
i
d
only
been
here
that
very
day
a
most
astounding
case
and
every
possible
evidence
wiped
out
oh
no
not
that
zizi
spoke
cheerfully
and
now
as
you
say
you
must
get
busy
in
the
matter
of
poor
martha
what
about
the
green
streak
yes
the
detective
spoke
to
rodney
there
was
a
dull
green
smear
across
the
palm
of
that
girl
s
left
hand
i
see
no
freshly
painted
furniture
in
this
no
there
wouldn
t
be
zizi
ruminated
and
it
wasn
t
paint
know
it
wasn
it
looked
like
paint
and
what
else
would
remain
there
so
indelibly
what
could
it
be
anyway
queried
granniss
what
do
you
suggest
i
can
t
think
myself
and
wise
looked
nonplussed
i
smelled
it
but
there
was
no
odor
of
paint
nobody
around
the
house
uses
water
colors
i
suppose
no
said
granniss
it
was
such
a
smear
as
might
have
been
made
by
a
paint
brush
filled
with
a
dull
green
watercolor
pigment
i
don
t
say
it
was
it
was
more
like
a
vegetable
stain
zizi
suggested
a
mark
like
that
could
have
been
made
by
grasping
a
dish
or
saucepan
that
had
held
oh
come
now
zizi
that
s
a
little
not
if
we
find
cold
spinach
in
the
refrigerator
zizi
persisted
martha
might
have
been
getting
something
to
in
that
case
the
green
smear
doesn
t
count
for
much
wise
said
but
we
have
accumulated
some
clues
we
have
the
yellow
beads
the
yellow
pillow
the
green
streak
and
last
but
by
no
means
least
the
dust
i
scraped
from
the
floor
in
this
explain
the
significance
of
that
won
t
you
asked
granniss
or
are
you
one
of
those
secretive
detectives
not
at
all
that
dust
is
to
my
mind
from
the
shoe
of
the
man
who
tried
to
rob
this
safe
last
night
thinking
that
money
was
in
it
now
i
admit
mr
granniss
that
you
knew
or
thought
you
did
that
the
money
was
there
you
knew
the
combination
you
are
quite
strong
enough
to
have
strangled
a
woman
who
surprised
you
at
your
job
yet
i
know
you
didn
t
have
anything
to
do
with
the
attempted
robbery
because
you
love
betty
zizi
said
softly
her
eyes
shining
with
sympathy
and
understanding
right
you
are
wise
go
also
because
wise
went
on
because
i
m
sure
that
is
the
footprint
of
the
burglar
and
while
the
footprint
as
a
print
is
too
indistinct
to
be
a
clue
to
the
man
who
made
it
yet
the
dust
that
forms
the
print
is
indicative
it
is
a
fine
dust
made
up
of
particles
of
cement
i
mean
such
dust
as
would
adhere
to
a
shoe
that
had
traversed
a
cement
floor
and
more
likely
an
imperfect
cement
that
means
the
cellar
rodney
cried
i
ve
been
down
there
a
lot
of
late
poking
around
for
that
everlasting
secret
passage
and
there
s
a
lot
of
loose
wise
gave
him
a
quick
glance
but
his
enthusiasm
was
so
genuine
that
the
detective
dismissed
a
sudden
qualm
of
suspicion
slip
down
and
get
me
a
sample
will
you
he
said
and
granniss
went
at
once
big
case
zizi
wise
said
as
the
two
were
left
alone
but
he
spoke
heavily
almost
despairingly
and
with
no
show
of
his
usual
exultant
interest
in
a
big
case
yes
but
the
black
eyes
turned
hopefully
to
his
own
there
are
tangible
clues
and
those
of
betty
s
can
wait
do
you
chase
those
that
have
to
do
with
martha
i
certainly
shall
martha
was
killed
by
the
burglar
did
he
kidnap
betty
and
kill
mr
varian
zizi
added
and
then
granniss
returned
he
brought
a
little
cellar
floor
dust
in
a
paper
and
as
wise
had
expected
that
and
the
particles
he
had
scraped
from
the
library
rug
were
indubitably
the
same
well
then
wise
remarked
the
burglar
came
up
from
the
where
he
had
been
hiding
goodness
knows
how
long
rodney
exclaimed
for
we
locked
the
house
securely
before
we
went
i
think
it
s
time
i
took
a
look
at
the
cellar
said
wise
and
all
three
started
down
chapter
xii
a
letter
from
nowhere
pennington
wise
himself
assisted
in
the
locking
up
of
the
house
that
night
for
he
was
determined
if
any
more
burglars
came
he
would
know
how
they
got
in
the
money
that
minna
had
in
her
possession
he
took
charge
of
saying
he
would
be
responsible
for
its
safety
long
the
detective
lay
awake
in
his
pleasant
bedroom
that
overlooked
the
sea
he
could
hear
the
great
waves
tossing
and
breaking
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
and
he
couldn
t
free
his
mind
from
a
queer
obsession
to
the
effect
that
those
waves
held
the
secret
of
the
mysteries
of
headland
house
it
s
too
absurd
he
thought
to
himself
in
the
darkness
but
i
do
feel
that
the
whole
matter
is
dependent
in
some
way
or
other
on
the
cliff
and
the
had
he
been
asked
to
elucidate
this
more
definitely
he
could
not
have
done
so
it
was
only
a
hunch
wise
s
hunches
were
often
worthy
of
consideration
and
he
determined
to
go
out
on
the
sea
in
somebody
s
boat
when
the
morning
came
and
see
if
he
could
find
any
inspiration
when
the
morning
came
it
brought
a
fresh
surprise
the
household
assembled
promptly
for
an
eight
o
clock
breakfast
minna
varian
pale
and
fragile
looking
clad
in
a
simple
black
house
dress
was
a
strong
contrast
to
the
young
and
glowing
vitality
of
zizi
whose
slim
little
black
frock
was
touched
here
and
there
with
henna
and
whose
vivid
and
expressive
face
needed
no
aid
of
cosmetics
to
be
a
bright
colorful
picture
in
itself
wise
was
very
grave
and
silent
was
in
a
mood
which
zizi
knew
was
that
of
utter
bafflement
it
was
not
often
the
detective
felt
this
conviction
of
helplessness
but
it
had
occurred
before
and
zizi
noted
it
with
some
alarm
it
meant
desperate
and
wearing
effort
on
wise
s
part
deep
thinking
and
dogged
persistence
in
forming
and
proving
theories
that
more
likely
than
not
would
prove
false
it
meant
a
strain
of
brain
and
nerves
that
might
result
in
a
physical
breakdown
the
detective
had
been
working
hard
of
late
and
this
impenetrable
mystery
seemed
the
last
straw
granniss
was
the
most
serene
of
the
quartette
he
was
young
and
hopeful
he
was
innocent
of
any
crime
or
knowledge
of
it
and
he
cared
naught
for
the
suspicions
of
the
local
police
in
fact
they
had
practically
given
up
the
case
as
far
beyond
their
ken
and
now
that
wise
was
in
charge
the
sheriff
wanted
nothing
to
say
in
the
matter
except
when
wise
desired
to
consult
him
and
granniss
was
confident
that
wise
would
find
betty
he
had
no
real
reason
for
his
belief
in
the
detective
s
magic
but
he
had
unbounded
faith
and
he
was
a
born
optimist
he
felt
sure
that
if
betty
had
been
killed
the
fact
would
have
become
known
by
this
time
if
she
were
still
alive
surely
she
would
be
found
he
had
come
to
believe
in
the
kidnappers
and
though
he
couldn
t
understand
how
the
deed
had
been
done
he
cared
more
to
get
betty
back
than
to
learn
what
had
happened
to
her
also
he
was
kept
busy
in
attending
to
the
daily
influx
of
business
letters
and
financial
matters
connected
with
the
varian
estate
doctor
varian
had
promised
to
come
up
to
headland
house
again
as
soon
as
he
could
but
he
was
a
busy
man
and
hadn
t
yet
made
time
for
the
visit
as
breakfast
was
about
to
be
served
kelly
brought
a
letter
to
minna
saying
simply
this
was
on
the
hall
table
when
i
came
downstairs
this
morning
a
glance
showed
minna
that
it
was
from
the
same
source
as
the
other
ransom
letter
and
she
handed
it
unopened
to
wise
staring
hard
at
the
envelope
he
slit
it
open
and
read
the
contents
aloud
we
know
all
that
is
going
on
we
have
your
daughter
you
have
the
required
sum
of
money
if
you
will
bring
about
an
exchange
we
will
do
our
part
your
fancy
detective
must
work
with
you
or
at
least
refrain
from
working
against
you
or
there
can
be
no
deal
you
may
drop
the
package
over
the
cliff
exactly
as
directed
before
at
midnight
on
friday
unless
you
accomplish
this
in
strict
accordance
with
our
orders
you
will
lose
both
the
money
and
your
child
one
divergence
from
our
directions
and
your
daughter
will
be
done
away
with
you
can
see
we
have
no
other
way
out
this
is
our
last
letter
and
our
final
offer
take
it
or
leave
it
enclosed
is
a
note
from
your
daughter
to
prove
that
we
are
telling
you
the
and
enclosed
was
a
small
slip
of
paper
on
which
was
written
mother
do
as
they
tell
you
is
that
your
daughter
s
writing
wise
asked
as
he
passed
the
little
note
to
minna
yes
she
whispered
trembling
so
violently
and
turning
so
white
that
zizi
flew
to
her
side
and
induced
her
to
take
a
sip
of
coffee
brace
up
now
dear
zizi
said
you
ll
need
all
your
strength
and
all
your
pluck
and
cheer
up
too
if
that
s
from
betty
she
s
alive
and
if
she
s
alive
we
ll
get
her
bank
on
that
zizi
s
strong
young
voice
and
encouraging
smile
did
as
much
as
the
coffee
to
invigorate
and
cheer
the
distracted
mother
and
rod
granniss
said
sure
that
s
betty
s
own
writing
forgery
about
that
now
mr
wise
what
next
next
is
to
find
out
how
that
note
got
into
this
house
said
pennington
wise
i
locked
up
myself
last
night
listened
but
i
heard
no
intruder
s
footstep
and
i
know
no
outside
door
or
window
was
opened
it
was
have
been
an
inside
job
kelly
yes
where
were
you
all
night
in
my
bed
sir
on
the
third
floor
of
the
oh
pouf
i
know
it
wasn
t
you
kelly
you
could
no
more
have
engineered
this
letter
than
you
could
fly
to
the
moon
and
hannah
i
suppose
was
in
her
bed
too
i
ve
no
wish
to
question
the
servants
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
was
the
kidnappers
then
zizi
asked
softly
it
was
the
kidnappers
wise
said
they
he
into
this
house
by
some
secret
way
which
we
have
got
to
find
they
or
their
agent
came
in
night
before
last
to
steal
that
money
from
the
safe
foiled
in
that
attempt
they
have
returned
to
their
ransom
scheme
hoping
to
get
the
money
that
way
they
are
desperate
and
don
t
know
mrs
varian
but
that
we
d
oh
penny
zizi
cried
don
t
throw
away
all
that
what
is
that
sum
sum
comparison
with
getting
my
child
cried
minna
so
excited
as
to
be
with
difficulty
warding
off
a
hysterical
attack
but
you
wouldn
t
get
her
zizi
asserted
positively
first
they
d
never
get
the
money
down
in
the
darkness
like
that
s
too
uncertain
and
if
they
did
they
wouldn
t
return
betty
know
they
wouldn
never
mind
that
now
zizi
wise
spoke
from
deep
preoccupation
we
have
till
friday
night
to
decide
about
it
today
is
only
wednesday
what
i
hope
to
get
at
from
this
note
is
the
identity
of
the
kidnapper
i
am
sure
it
is
the
same
man
as
the
one
who
wrote
that
blackmail
this
is
typewritten
granniss
said
studying
the
letter
and
not
signed
in
any
way
i
ve
heard
though
that
typewriting
is
as
easily
distinguished
or
recognized
as
that
s
true
in
a
sense
wise
told
him
i
mean
if
you
suspect
a
certain
person
or
machine
you
can
check
up
the
peculiarities
of
the
script
and
prove
the
typing
but
in
this
case
the
letter
was
doubtless
written
on
some
public
machine
in
a
hotel
or
business
office
and
even
if
found
would
give
no
clue
to
the
writer
we
have
to
do
with
the
cleverest
mind
i
have
ever
been
up
against
that
is
positive
now
the
reason
i
connect
the
kidnapper
and
the
blackmailer
is
twofold
first
if
this
man
s
blackmailing
scheme
proved
unsuccessful
he
may
have
struck
at
his
victim
in
this
more
desperate
way
and
second
there
is
a
resemblance
in
the
diction
of
the
notes
from
the
kidnappers
and
the
note
of
blackmail
intent
signed
step
what
do
you
suppose
step
means
granniss
asked
short
for
stephen
i
daresay
replied
wise
there
s
no
other
name
that
begins
yes
there
is
stepney
it
doesn
t
matter
step
is
our
man
that
i
m
sure
but
how
to
find
such
an
elusive
individual
is
a
puzzling
then
you
believe
there
s
a
secret
passage
granniss
said
there
simply
has
to
be
it
may
be
a
hidden
one
it
may
be
a
false
doorway
or
window
frame
but
there
is
most
certainly
a
way
for
that
villain
to
get
in
and
out
of
this
house
at
will
now
that
way
must
be
found
and
at
once
or
i
give
up
my
profession
and
make
no
further
claim
to
detective
ability
we
ll
find
it
penny
zizi
promised
him
find
it
if
you
have
to
tear
down
the
whole
house
minna
exclaimed
excitedly
she
was
nervously
caressing
the
note
from
betty
and
was
ready
to
further
any
project
that
was
suggested
you
don
t
own
the
house
wise
asked
no
but
i
ll
buy
it
it
s
in
the
market
and
the
price
is
not
so
very
high
then
you
can
tear
it
down
if
you
wish
and
i
can
sell
the
ground
good
business
deal
granniss
said
i
d
like
nothing
better
than
to
drive
a
pick
into
these
old
but
there
s
no
place
to
drive
with
any
expectation
of
success
wise
demurred
where
s
your
friend
north
isn
t
he
an
architect
can
you
get
him
up
here
surely
rod
said
i
ll
telephone
him
if
you
say
so
i
m
sure
he
ll
be
glad
to
come
he
isn
t
a
professional
architect
but
he
knows
more
about
building
plans
than
many
a
firm
of
contractors
call
him
then
please
when
you
ve
finished
your
breakfast
wise
directed
and
returned
to
his
study
of
the
letter
i
can
t
understand
it
at
all
he
groaned
to
zizi
after
breakfast
was
over
minna
had
gone
to
her
room
and
rodney
was
reading
the
mail
wise
and
zizi
were
in
the
hall
sitting
on
the
sofa
with
the
yellow
pillows
this
figures
in
it
zizi
said
patting
the
yellow
pillow
that
had
held
the
little
hairpin
as
how
find
that
secret
entrance
first
she
said
drawing
her
pretty
brows
together
that
will
explain
most
everything
and
penny
it
isn
t
a
secret
passage
as
they
call
it
it
s
just
a
concealed
and
through
the
cellar
you
know
there
was
cellar
dust
on
the
library
floor
the
that
only
proved
the
man
had
been
down
cellar
probably
until
the
time
was
ripe
i
ve
scoured
that
cellar
so
have
i
zizi
and
there
s
not
a
loose
stone
in
its
walls
or
a
trap
in
its
floor
that
i
m
i
m
sure
of
that
too
and
penny
i
even
went
down
the
you
did
you
little
rascal
they
told
me
dunn
went
down
and
examined
well
i
had
to
go
too
it
wasn
t
difficult
stone
sides
are
easy
to
climb
up
and
down
not
very
slippery
either
but
dirty
my
i
ruined
one
of
my
pet
dresses
yet
there
was
no
hole
in
the
old
well
sides
no
missing
stone
or
anything
suspicious
and
that
settles
the
cellar
i
don
t
think
the
entrance
is
through
the
cellar
i
incline
more
to
the
idea
of
a
false
door
frame
know
the
frame
and
all
on
hinges
then
locking
would
not
affect
the
opening
of
the
whole
that
s
all
right
which
door
there
are
only
two
i
ve
examined
them
both
it
may
be
a
get
friend
north
to
confab
with
you
you
re
clever
enough
penny
but
you
re
not
a
real
architect
mr
north
may
have
some
suggestions
to
make
that
with
your
ingenuity
may
work
it
lawrence
north
arrived
and
with
him
came
claire
blackwood
the
latter
was
urged
to
the
visit
largely
by
curiosity
to
learn
how
things
were
going
and
also
by
a
desire
to
renew
her
expressions
of
sympathy
and
hope
to
mrs
varian
zizi
managed
to
get
a
few
words
alone
with
claire
tell
me
about
this
eleanor
the
girl
said
i
feel
sure
a
lot
hinges
on
that
peculiar
matter
of
the
pearls
is
eleanor
a
scheming
sort
oh
no
exclaimed
mrs
blackwood
she
is
a
dear
girl
young
and
of
a
simple
charming
nature
she
was
devoted
to
her
cousin
and
had
no
thought
of
the
family
pearls
ever
being
hers
don
t
for
a
moment
think
of
eleanor
varian
as
capable
of
the
slightest
thought
of
disloyalty
much
less
of
envy
or
well
i
just
wanted
to
know
said
zizi
with
her
winning
confidential
smile
what
about
her
parents
could
her
mother
have
influenced
mr
frederick
varian
s
mind
against
his
own
daughter
no
indeed
nor
doctor
varian
either
why
they
re
the
best
and
finest
kind
of
people
all
of
them
whatever
the
explanation
of
those
pearls
being
left
away
from
betty
it
was
not
due
to
any
maneuvering
on
the
part
of
eleanor
or
her
parents
of
that
you
may
be
sure
meantime
lawrence
north
and
the
detective
were
discussing
architecture
they
were
in
the
library
and
the
plans
of
the
house
were
spread
out
before
them
i
m
interested
north
said
looking
eagerly
at
the
plans
for
i
m
always
fond
of
plans
and
too
i
want
to
prove
my
contention
that
there
s
no
space
unaccounted
for
at
first
i
thought
there
might
be
a
bit
of
spare
room
between
this
wall
and
this
see
but
that
jamb
is
merely
the
back
of
a
small
cupboard
in
the
hall
can
you
find
any
hint
of
false
building
no
i
can
t
wise
admitted
and
then
he
unfolded
his
theory
of
a
double
door
frame
rather
a
hinged
door
frame
or
window
frame
that
said
north
must
be
looked
for
in
the
house
not
on
the
plans
but
i
doubt
it
any
such
thing
would
be
apt
to
show
the
joints
after
years
of
disuse
you
see
this
house
hasn
t
been
lived
in
before
for
a
long
then
i
ll
have
to
give
up
the
notion
of
a
double
door
and
wise
sighed
now
here
s
another
matter
i
want
to
go
out
in
a
boat
good
motor
boat
and
have
a
look
round
the
sea
and
the
cliff
and
observe
for
myself
the
possibilities
of
an
expert
climber
entering
the
grounds
from
that
side
will
you
take
me
in
your
boat
i
m
told
you
have
a
fine
one
of
course
i
will
was
the
ready
response
when
do
you
want
to
go
as
soon
as
you
can
make
it
convenient
i
want
to
work
rapidly
as
things
are
coming
to
a
focus
and
i
don
t
dare
north
stared
at
him
as
if
wondering
how
a
trip
in
his
boat
would
advance
the
work
definitely
but
the
detective
had
no
intention
of
telling
him
about
the
kidnapper
s
letter
and
too
wise
wanted
to
view
the
whole
headland
from
the
ocean
the
result
was
that
the
two
started
off
at
once
and
going
first
to
north
s
bungalow
to
get
his
keys
and
also
his
man
who
helped
run
the
boat
inside
of
an
hour
pennington
wise
found
himself
out
on
the
ocean
with
north
and
joe
mills
who
though
taciturn
and
even
grumpy
was
a
good
navigator
remarkable
cliff
wise
exclaimed
amazed
at
its
effect
from
below
it
s
all
of
that
north
said
most
wonderful
cliff
on
the
whole
maine
coast
they
say
notice
the
overhang
and
then
tell
me
if
any
one
could
climb
it
no
human
being
could
wise
declared
and
i
can
think
of
no
animal
a
spider
go
clear
round
to
the
other
side
will
you
north
gave
orders
and
mills
drove
them
round
the
great
headland
and
on
all
sides
it
was
as
massive
and
forbidding
as
the
first
view
high
tide
isn
t
it
asked
wise
as
they
went
on
beyond
the
headland
and
then
turned
back
again
yes
said
north
glancing
at
the
rocky
base
almost
top
rise
high
very
twenty
feet
at
i
thought
so
marvelous
tides
up
in
this
locality
well
there
s
nothing
more
to
be
discovered
by
gazing
at
these
rocks
and
water
let
s
go
on
the
trip
homeward
the
detective
proved
himself
so
entertaining
that
north
went
back
to
headland
house
with
him
again
they
poured
over
the
plans
of
the
house
and
wise
announced
his
determination
of
using
a
pick
on
one
room
in
the
third
story
that
he
surmised
might
be
a
trifle
shorter
than
its
adjacent
walls
implied
but
it
measures
up
north
insisted
not
quite
wise
declared
there
may
be
a
two
foot
space
in
there
which
would
be
enough
for
a
secret
you
re
a
persistent
one
north
laughed
all
right
mr
wise
go
ahead
with
your
investigation
may
i
help
i
can
wield
a
pick
with
the
best
of
them
the
detective
glanced
at
the
lithe
sinewy
form
that
seemed
to
be
all
muscle
and
no
superfluous
flesh
and
said
admiringly
i
believe
you
but
i
think
kelly
or
the
chauffeur
can
do
the
really
hard
no
let
me
do
it
north
offered
i
d
really
enjoy
so
half
amused
at
his
own
decision
wise
agreed
and
the
two
went
in
search
of
the
necessary
tools
but
the
result
of
their
labor
was
absolutely
nothing
beyond
an
incredible
amount
of
dust
and
dirt
of
lath
and
plaster
and
two
very
much
disheveled
men
now
you
must
stay
to
dinner
mr
north
the
detective
urged
him
you
can
put
yourself
to
right
enough
for
our
informal
meal
and
it
is
too
late
for
you
to
get
to
your
home
by
dinner
so
north
stayed
and
at
dinner
they
all
discussed
freely
the
whole
affair
mrs
varian
did
not
appear
at
the
table
the
nurse
thinking
it
was
better
for
her
to
have
no
more
excitement
that
day
so
zizi
calmly
appropriated
the
chair
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
acted
the
part
of
hostess
prettily
and
capably
wise
changed
his
mind
about
confiding
to
lawrence
north
the
matter
of
the
ransom
letters
and
concluded
that
in
the
absence
of
mrs
varian
the
subject
might
be
discussed
at
any
rate
the
detective
summed
up
we
re
in
the
possession
of
positive
knowledge
we
know
that
betty
was
kidnapped
oh
come
now
north
said
thoughtfully
those
letters
may
be
faked
seems
to
me
they
must
be
some
clever
villain
who
expects
to
get
all
that
money
under
false
promises
i
don
t
believe
for
a
minute
there
is
a
would
anyone
kidnap
betty
varian
for
the
usual
kidnapper
s
reason
wise
replied
well
how
did
the
kidnapper
get
in
oh
mr
north
wise
threw
up
his
hands
this
from
you
i
made
up
my
mind
that
if
one
more
person
said
to
me
how
did
the
kidnapper
get
in
i
d
have
him
arrested
i
don
t
how
he
got
in
i
m
going
to
find
out
i
think
i
won
t
assist
in
the
work
personally
the
next
time
you
try
lawrence
said
i
scarcely
could
get
myself
presentable
for
dinner
but
seriously
mr
wise
you
asked
me
up
here
to
consult
with
you
now
i
m
sure
we
must
agree
that
there
is
a
way
in
and
out
of
this
house
that
we
don
t
know
of
and
that
explains
the
entrance
of
the
person
who
killed
that
poor
girl
in
the
and
explains
the
disappearance
of
miss
varian
and
the
scattering
of
her
beads
said
lawrence
north
interrogatively
yes
there
were
several
beads
found
in
the
kitchen
that
have
been
identified
as
then
the
way
in
must
be
connected
with
the
kitchen
north
remarked
perhaps
but
not
it
s
a
dark
night
mr
north
rodney
granniss
said
hospitably
won
t
you
spend
the
night
here
we
can
give
you
a
after
a
polite
demurrer
north
accepted
the
invitation
the
evening
was
spent
in
further
and
repeated
discussion
of
the
known
facts
and
the
surmised
possibilities
of
the
mystery
and
then
both
the
detective
and
granniss
went
about
locking
up
the
house
against
further
marauders
and
they
all
retired
and
the
next
morning
they
found
that
lawrence
north
had
disappeared
his
room
showed
signs
of
a
struggle
a
chair
was
overturned
a
rug
awry
and
deep
scratches
on
the
shining
floor
proved
a
scuffle
of
some
sort
another
kidnapping
case
granniss
exclaimed
must
have
been
a
husky
chap
that
got
the
better
of
north
could
there
have
been
two
against
him
he
s
a
powerful
fighter
search
the
house
said
wise
briefly
and
keep
everybody
out
of
north
s
bedroom
i
ll
lock
it
and
take
the
key
myself
now
look
for
him
is
he
given
to
practical
joking
but
no
amount
of
searching
disclosed
lawrence
north
or
any
sign
of
him
dead
or
alive
and
the
locked
doors
and
windows
were
undisturbed
he
certainly
didn
t
leave
of
his
own
accord
said
granniss
he
couldn
t
have
locked
the
doors
behind
he
was
carried
off
cried
minna
just
as
betty
was
oh
who
of
us
is
safe
now
chapter
xiii
where
is
north
pennington
wise
was
at
his
wits
end
his
wits
were
of
the
finest
type
and
had
always
stood
him
in
good
stead
but
he
had
reached
their
limit
at
least
regarding
this
present
case
baffling
was
too
mild
a
word
for
it
uncanny
it
was
not
for
there
was
no
hint
or
evidence
of
anything
supernatural
in
the
taking
off
of
lawrence
north
he
was
a
big
strong
personality
and
he
had
gone
out
of
that
house
by
natural
means
whether
voluntarily
or
not
that
is
of
course
if
he
gone
out
of
the
house
wise
was
inclined
to
think
he
had
but
rodney
granniss
still
held
to
the
possibility
of
some
concealed
room
a
dungeon
where
the
mysterious
disappearances
could
be
compassed
wise
paid
no
attention
to
granniss
opinions
not
from
any
toward
the
young
man
but
because
he
had
concluded
to
his
own
satisfaction
that
there
was
really
no
space
for
a
concealed
room
in
the
house
north
had
come
up
there
for
the
purpose
of
helping
him
look
for
such
a
matter
and
north
had
agreed
that
it
could
not
be
and
now
north
himself
was
gone
off
the
mere
phrase
carried
off
seemed
to
wise
incongruous
could
north
have
been
carried
off
without
making
noise
enough
to
rouse
some
of
the
sleeping
household
it
was
incredible
before
discussing
the
matter
with
minna
or
calling
the
local
police
again
wise
went
to
the
bedroom
north
had
occupied
and
locked
himself
in
if
i
can
t
tell
he
said
to
himself
whether
that
man
was
kidnapped
or
whether
he
sneaked
himself
would
he
do
such
a
thing
as
that
my
desperation
over
this
puzzle
is
leading
my
mind
carefully
without
touching
a
thing
wise
considered
the
state
of
the
room
the
bed
had
been
occupied
and
it
was
quite
evident
had
been
hastily
quitted
the
coverings
were
tossed
back
over
the
footboard
and
the
pillow
still
bore
the
impress
of
a
head
on
the
dresser
lay
north
s
collar
and
tie
and
beneath
the
pillow
wise
discovered
his
watch
and
a
handkerchief
clearly
the
man
had
gone
after
a
hasty
and
incomplete
toilette
on
the
small
table
lay
some
sheets
of
paper
and
a
pencil
these
papers
were
some
that
they
had
used
the
night
before
drawing
plans
and
making
measurements
of
the
house
scanning
the
papers
wise
was
startled
to
see
a
scrawled
message
on
the
corner
of
a
sheet
it
read
they
ve
got
me
it
had
been
so
hastily
jotted
down
as
to
be
almost
illegible
had
north
managed
to
scribble
it
while
his
captor
or
captors
looked
another
way
it
was
all
too
unbelievable
the
thought
would
creep
in
that
north
was
implicated
in
the
mystery
himself
yet
that
was
quite
as
unbelievable
as
the
rest
of
it
not
more
so
wise
turned
his
attention
to
the
disordered
furniture
the
overturned
chair
was
not
broken
but
a
glass
tumbler
was
evidently
it
had
been
knocked
off
the
night
stand
the
rug
was
in
wrinkles
and
one
window
curtain
had
been
partly
pulled
from
its
rod
the
scratches
on
the
hardwood
floor
were
apparently
made
by
scuffling
feet
but
of
that
wise
could
not
be
sure
in
fine
the
whole
disorder
of
the
room
could
have
been
made
by
struggling
men
or
could
have
been
faked
by
any
one
desiring
to
produce
that
effect
yet
i
ve
no
reason
to
think
north
faked
it
wise
told
himself
frankly
except
that
that
would
be
an
easy
way
out
of
it
for
me
and
that
message
he
left
looks
genuine
his
watch
is
a
valuable
one
lord
i
up
against
it
he
went
downstairs
and
learned
that
lawrence
north
s
straw
hat
still
hung
on
the
hall
rack
the
man
must
have
been
forcibly
carried
off
he
couldn
t
have
walked
out
without
collar
tie
or
hat
moreover
the
doors
were
all
locked
it
still
was
necessary
to
assume
a
secret
exit
from
the
house
wise
inclined
to
the
hinged
door
frame
or
window
frame
but
his
most
careful
search
failed
to
reveal
any
such
he
determined
to
get
an
expert
carpenter
to
look
over
the
house
feeling
that
such
would
be
better
than
an
architect
crestfallen
dispirited
and
utterly
nonplussed
wise
sat
down
in
the
library
to
think
it
over
first
the
authorities
must
be
told
of
north
s
disappearance
and
all
that
but
those
things
he
left
to
granniss
the
mystery
was
his
province
acting
on
a
sudden
impulse
wise
started
off
at
once
for
north
s
home
this
was
a
bungalow
of
artistic
effects
and
quiet
unpretentious
charm
his
knock
brought
the
grumpy
joe
mills
to
the
door
whatcha
want
was
his
surly
greeting
as
i
m
here
on
an
important
matter
i
ll
come
inside
wise
said
and
entered
the
little
whatcha
doin
here
mills
continued
where
s
mr
north
i
don
t
know
where
he
is
isn
t
he
here
why
no
stayed
up
to
headland
house
last
night
ain
t
you
the
detective
from
there
yes
i
am
and
mr
north
left
headland
house
breakfast
this
morning
didn
t
he
come
home
no
he
didn
t
leastways
i
ain
t
seen
him
an
i
ve
got
work
to
do
you
can
leave
as
soon
as
you
look
here
my
man
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
your
head
mr
north
has
disappeared
well
he
s
got
a
right
to
disappear
if
he
likes
t
he
but
he
went
i
don
t
care
how
he
went
off
it
s
nothin
to
me
an
i
ve
got
my
work
to
do
now
you
not
yet
said
wise
coolly
and
began
to
look
about
the
house
there
s
no
use
in
taking
that
attitude
mr
mills
the
authorities
of
the
village
and
of
the
county
will
be
here
shortly
mr
north
turns
up
which
i
don
t
think
he
will
now
i
m
going
to
do
a
little
looking
about
on
my
wise
set
to
work
and
went
swiftly
over
the
house
from
room
to
room
he
found
nothing
that
gave
him
any
clue
to
north
s
disappearance
nor
anything
that
gave
him
much
information
as
to
north
s
private
life
even
an
examination
of
the
letters
and
notes
in
the
small
desk
showed
only
some
bills
some
invitations
some
circulars
that
meant
nothing
to
the
detective
he
noted
some
memoranda
in
lawrence
north
s
handwriting
and
saw
that
it
corresponded
with
the
note
left
for
him
sheriff
potter
came
in
while
he
was
there
but
the
conversation
between
the
two
men
was
of
little
interest
to
either
it
was
all
so
hopeless
it
seemed
to
wise
so
blankly
mysterious
it
seemed
to
potter
claire
blackwood
came
over
from
her
home
and
wise
turned
to
her
as
to
a
friend
do
tell
me
something
about
this
man
north
mrs
blackwood
he
said
have
you
known
him
long
only
through
this
summer
she
replied
he
s
a
new
yorker
but
i
don
t
know
much
else
about
what
s
his
business
i
m
not
sure
but
i
think
he
s
a
real
estate
man
he
s
spending
two
months
here
and
he
rented
this
bungalow
furnished
you
see
mr
wise
the
people
of
this
colony
are
a
sort
of
lawless
set
i
mean
if
we
like
any
one
we
don
t
bother
to
inquire
into
their
antecedents
or
their
social
is
north
married
i
don
t
think
so
at
least
i
ve
always
thought
him
a
bachelor
though
nowadays
you
never
can
tell
he
may
have
a
wife
for
all
i
at
any
rate
mrs
blackwood
he
has
most
mysteriously
disappeared
and
i
do
hope
if
you
know
at
all
about
the
man
you
will
tell
me
for
i
don
t
mind
admitting
i
am
greatly
distressed
and
disturbed
at
this
new
development
of
the
varian
you
connect
mr
north
s
disappearance
with
betty
varian
s
then
how
can
i
help
it
both
vanished
from
the
same
house
it
proves
of
course
that
there
is
a
secret
exit
but
it
is
strange
that
such
can
not
be
it
is
disappointing
mr
wise
to
find
that
such
a
famous
detective
as
you
can
not
find
a
concealed
entrance
to
a
country
house
you
are
not
more
disappointed
than
i
am
at
that
fact
mrs
blackwood
i
am
chagrined
of
course
but
i
am
more
frankly
puzzled
the
whole
case
is
so
amazing
the
evidence
so
scanty
are
can
i
do
i
feel
like
saying
i
was
called
in
too
late
i
m
not
sure
i
could
have
done
better
had
i
been
here
at
first
i
can
t
see
where
evidence
has
been
destroyed
or
clues
lost
it
is
all
you
are
delightfully
candid
and
far
from
bumptious
she
said
smiling
at
him
i
feared
you
were
of
the
variety
and
i
see
you
aren
help
me
to
know
it
all
mrs
blackwood
wise
urged
i
can
t
help
feeling
you
know
more
about
lawrence
north
than
any
one
else
up
here
if
so
can
t
you
tell
me
something
of
his
life
no
truly
mr
wise
i
don
t
know
any
more
than
i
ve
told
you
he
was
up
here
last
year
is
my
first
season
but
i
don
t
know
of
any
one
up
here
now
that
knows
him
very
well
he
is
a
quiet
reserved
sort
of
man
a
matter
of
fact
we
are
not
a
gossipy
disheartened
and
disappointed
wise
went
back
to
headland
house
only
to
find
that
doctor
varian
had
arrived
during
his
absence
the
detective
was
glad
to
have
him
to
talk
to
for
it
promised
at
least
a
fresh
viewpoint
to
be
considered
i
admit
doctor
varian
wise
said
frankly
as
the
two
confabbed
in
the
varian
library
i
have
no
theory
that
will
fit
this
case
at
all
i
have
solved
many
mysteries
i
have
found
many
criminals
but
never
before
have
i
struck
a
case
so
absolutely
devoid
of
even
an
imaginary
solution
granting
a
criminal
that
desired
to
bring
disaster
to
the
varian
family
why
should
he
want
to
abduct
lawrence
north
perhaps
north
knew
something
incriminating
to
him
suggested
the
doctor
but
that
s
purely
supposition
there
s
no
fact
to
prove
it
or
anything
like
it
as
a
start
suppose
we
assume
a
kidnapper
of
betty
varian
although
even
before
that
we
have
to
assume
a
secret
entrance
into
this
that
i
think
we
must
assume
said
varian
it
seems
so
if
you
knew
how
hard
i
ve
hunted
for
one
well
then
assume
a
kidnapper
who
for
the
sake
of
ransom
abducts
betty
varian
and
kills
her
father
and
kills
her
father
who
interrupted
the
good
enough
so
far
but
what
about
north
i
can
t
fit
north
in
he
is
in
league
with
the
that
s
too
absurd
he
and
my
brother
weren
t
even
oh
i
know
it
s
absurd
but
what
isn
t
i
can
t
see
a
ray
of
light
and
then
there
s
that
awful
matter
of
the
maid
martha
i
think
mr
wise
that
since
you
admit
failure
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
take
mrs
varian
away
and
give
up
the
leaving
betty
to
her
fate
we
can
search
for
the
child
just
as
well
from
boston
or
new
york
as
from
i
don
t
think
so
doctor
take
mrs
varian
away
if
you
wish
if
she
will
go
i
shall
stay
here
and
solve
this
mystery
because
i
have
failed
thus
far
is
no
proof
i
shall
continue
to
be
unsuccessful
mrs
varian
is
a
rich
woman
am
not
a
poor
man
i
shall
use
such
funds
as
she
provides
supplementing
them
if
necessary
with
my
own
but
i
shall
find
betty
varian
if
she
s
alive
shall
find
lawrence
north
he
is
alive
i
shall
discover
the
murderer
or
murderers
of
frederick
varian
and
of
you
speak
confidently
mr
i
do
because
i
mean
to
devote
my
whole
soul
to
this
thing
i
can
t
fail
ultimately
the
man
was
so
desperate
in
his
determination
so
sincere
in
his
intent
that
doctor
varian
was
impressed
and
said
heartily
i
believe
you
will
now
here
s
something
i
ve
found
out
i
ve
talked
with
my
brother
s
lawyer
and
i
find
there
was
something
in
frederick
s
life
that
he
kept
secret
i
don
t
for
one
minute
believe
it
was
anything
disgraceful
or
dishonorable
for
i
knew
my
brother
too
well
for
that
but
it
may
have
been
some
misfortune
even
some
youthful
error
whatever
it
was
it
had
an
effect
on
his
later
years
and
there
s
that
strange
matter
of
the
varian
pearls
those
pearls
mr
wise
are
historic
they
have
never
been
bequeathed
to
any
one
save
the
oldest
son
or
daughter
of
a
varian
now
the
fact
that
betty
and
her
father
sometimes
squabbled
is
not
enough
to
make
my
brother
leave
them
to
daughter
instead
of
to
his
own
yet
i
can
form
no
theory
to
explain
the
fact
that
he
did
do
so
i
ve
tried
to
think
he
was
temporarily
or
hypochondriacally
insane
but
i
can
t
reconcile
that
belief
with
my
knowledge
of
his
physical
health
and
then
i
ve
wondered
if
he
ever
did
me
a
wrong
in
the
past
that
i
never
learned
of
and
if
this
was
by
way
of
reparation
but
that
is
too
unlikely
again
i
ve
thought
that
there
might
be
some
error
in
the
family
records
and
that
i
might
be
the
elder
son
instead
of
fred
but
i
checked
it
all
up
and
he
was
two
years
my
senior
yet
he
told
the
lawyer
who
drew
up
his
will
that
justice
demanded
that
the
pearls
be
left
to
his
niece
instead
of
to
his
daughter
now
what
could
he
have
meant
by
that
i
can
t
imagine
but
i
m
glad
you
have
told
me
these
things
for
it
makes
me
feel
there
be
something
pretty
serious
back
of
all
this
you
don
t
think
it
could
in
any
way
reflect
on
mrs
varian
no
i
don
t
i
ve
talked
it
over
with
the
lawyer
and
also
with
my
wife
and
we
all
agree
that
minna
varian
is
a
true
sincere
and
good
woman
there
is
not
only
no
blame
or
stigma
to
be
attached
to
her
in
any
way
but
whatever
was
the
secret
of
my
brother
s
life
his
wife
knows
nothing
of
yet
i
can
imagine
no
secret
no
incident
that
would
necessitate
that
strange
bequest
of
the
family
nor
can
i
except
that
he
might
have
thought
he
owed
me
some
reparation
for
some
real
or
fancied
wrong
it
must
have
been
to
me
for
he
couldn
t
have
wronged
my
daughter
in
any
way
there
was
no
question
about
the
division
of
my
father
s
fortune
we
were
the
only
children
and
it
was
equally
shared
the
pearls
were
frederick
s
as
he
was
the
oldest
child
that
s
all
there
is
to
the
matter
it
is
strange
that
my
brother
spoke
in
the
way
he
did
to
his
lawyer
he
seemed
really
broken
up
over
the
business
the
lawyer
said
and
he
was
deeply
moved
when
he
dictated
the
clause
leaving
the
pearls
to
betty
is
really
the
child
of
the
frederick
varians
wise
asked
oh
yes
mrs
varian
lost
her
first
two
babies
in
infancy
and
when
the
third
child
was
expected
we
were
all
afraid
it
would
not
live
but
betty
was
a
healthy
baby
from
the
first
and
i
ve
known
her
all
her
her
father
was
as
fond
of
her
as
her
mother
was
yes
no
i
can
t
explain
it
mr
wise
but
in
my
medical
practice
i
ve
not
infrequently
found
a
definite
antipathy
between
a
father
and
a
daughter
for
no
apparent
reason
i
mean
well
that
condition
existed
between
frederick
varian
and
his
child
they
almost
never
agreed
in
their
tastes
or
opinions
and
while
they
were
affectionate
at
times
yet
there
was
friction
at
other
times
now
minna
and
betty
were
always
congenial
thought
alike
on
all
subjects
and
never
had
any
little
squabbles
i
m
telling
you
this
in
hopes
it
will
help
you
though
i
confess
i
don
t
see
how
it
i
hope
it
may
at
any
rate
it
is
interesting
in
view
of
the
strange
occurrences
up
here
you
ve
found
no
papers
or
letters
bearing
on
this
matter
among
mr
varian
s
effects
no
except
a
few
proofs
that
he
was
more
or
less
and
you
can
t
learn
by
whom
no
there
were
one
or
two
veiled
threats
that
might
have
meant
blackmail
and
yet
might
not
i
have
them
safe
but
i
didn
t
bring
them
up
it
doesn
t
matter
such
a
careful
blackmailer
as
the
one
we
have
to
deal
with
never
would
write
letters
that
could
be
and
what
is
to
be
done
in
this
north
matter
first
of
all
i
shall
offer
a
large
reward
for
any
word
of
him
i
have
faith
in
offered
rewards
if
they
are
large
enough
they
often
tempt
accomplices
to
turn
state
s
evidence
i
ve
already
ordered
posters
and
advertisements
with
portraits
of
north
my
agents
will
attend
to
this
and
though
it
may
bring
no
results
yet
if
it
doesn
t
will
be
a
hint
in
another
meaning
that
lawrence
north
is
implicated
in
the
no
i
can
t
agree
to
that
why
the
man
himself
was
carried
i
know
well
doctor
varian
first
of
all
we
must
find
that
secret
passage
there
is
one
can
t
blink
that
fact
now
where
is
it
think
of
having
a
given
problem
like
that
and
being
unable
to
solve
it
i
am
so
amazed
at
my
own
helplessness
that
i
am
too
stunned
to
work
go
to
it
man
ll
find
it
tear
the
house
down
if
necessary
but
get
at
it
i
shall
i
ve
already
sent
for
carpenters
to
demolish
some
parts
of
the
i
wish
i
could
stay
up
here
and
see
the
work
progress
you
ll
have
to
find
the
secret
you
know
you
can
t
help
it
if
you
tear
down
the
whole
i
don
t
mean
to
do
that
i
want
to
continue
to
live
in
the
house
but
some
expert
carpenters
can
dig
into
certain
portions
of
it
without
making
the
rest
uninhabitable
and
that
s
what
i
propose
what
about
finger
prints
i
thought
you
detectives
set
great
store
by
not
in
a
case
like
this
suppose
we
find
finger
prints
re
not
likely
to
be
those
of
any
registered
criminal
and
since
this
talk
with
you
i
shall
turn
my
investigations
in
a
slightly
different
channel
anyhow
i
must
look
up
mr
varian
s
past
look
all
you
wish
but
i
tell
you
now
you
ll
find
nothing
indicative
whatever
secret
my
brother
had
it
was
not
a
matter
of
crime
even
of
lighter
wrongdoing
and
if
frederick
varian
wanted
to
keep
the
matter
secret
neither
you
nor
any
other
detective
will
ever
find
it
out
that
may
have
been
true
during
your
brother
s
life
doctor
but
now
that
he
can
t
longer
protect
his
secret
it
must
come
all
right
mr
wise
i
truly
hope
it
will
for
even
if
it
reflects
against
my
brother
s
integrity
it
may
aid
in
finding
betty
i
don
t
believe
that
girl
is
dead
you
no
i
don
t
i
believe
these
letters
from
the
kidnappers
are
true
bills
i
believe
they
have
her
concealed
and
confined
and
by
heaven
doctor
varian
i
m
going
to
find
her
i
know
that
sounds
like
mere
bluster
but
i
ve
never
totally
failed
on
a
case
yet
this
biggest
one
i
ve
ever
tackled
shall
not
be
my
first
failure
i
succeed
if
i
can
help
in
any
way
command
me
i
m
glad
to
see
you
don
t
think
i
m
criminally
implicated
because
of
the
legacy
of
the
pearls
eleanor
shall
never
touch
them
until
we
ve
positively
concluded
that
betty
is
dead
but
that
s
a
small
matter
those
pearls
have
lain
undisturbed
in
safe
deposit
many
years
may
lie
there
many
years
more
let
the
search
work
go
on
you
know
nothing
of
north
personally
no
i
never
met
him
has
he
no
relatives
haven
t
found
any
yet
but
you
see
the
police
don
t
hold
that
it
is
a
criminal
case
as
yet
they
say
he
may
have
walked
out
of
his
own
half
dressed
and
leaving
his
watch
behind
him
and
that
note
to
say
what
had
happened
that
note
rings
true
doctor
and
either
it
is
sincere
or
north
is
one
of
the
cleverest
scamps
i
ever
met
up
with
it
s
conceivable
that
he
is
a
scamp
but
i
can
t
see
anything
that
points
to
it
why
should
a
perfect
stranger
to
the
varian
family
cut
up
such
a
trick
as
to
come
up
here
and
pretend
to
be
kidnapped
he
wasn
t
it
s
too
everything
is
too
absurd
said
wise
bitterly
chapter
xiv
a
green
stain
tell
me
more
about
betty
zizi
said
that
is
if
you
don
t
mind
talking
about
oh
no
minna
returned
i
love
to
talk
about
her
it
s
the
only
way
i
can
keep
my
hope
alive
zizi
was
sitting
with
mrs

while
the
nurse
went
out
for
a
walk
there
was
a
mutual
attraction
between
the
two
and
the
sympathetic
dark
eyes
of
the
girl
rested
kindly
on
the
face
of
the
bereaved
and
suffering
mother
tell
me
about
her
when
she
was
little
was
she
born
in
new
york
no
at
the
time
of
her
birth
we
chanced
to
be
spending
a
summer
up
in
vermont
in
the
green
mountains
i
hoped
to
get
home
before
betty
arrived
but
i
didn
t
and
she
was
born
in
a
tiny
little
hospital
way
up
in
a
vermont
village
however
she
was
a
strong
healthy
baby
and
has
never
been
ill
a
day
in
her
and
she
is
so
pretty
and
sweet
know
not
only
from
her
picture
but
from
everything
i
hear
about
her
i
m
going
to
find
her
mrs
varian
zizi
s
strange
little
face
glowed
with
determination
and
she
smiled
hopefully
i
don
t
doubt
your
wish
to
do
so
zizi
dear
but
i
can
t
think
you
will
succeed
i
m
so
disappointed
in
mr
wise
s
he
hasn
t
failed
zizi
cried
instantly
eager
to
defend
her
master
don
t
say
that
is
baffled
s
a
most
extraordinary
case
but
he
hasn
t
failed
he
won
t
fail
but
he
s
been
here
a
week
and
what
has
he
done
so
far
i
ll
tell
you
what
he
s
done
mrs
zizi
spoke
seriously
we
were
talking
it
over
this
morning
and
he
s
done
this
much
he
s
discovered
at
least
to
his
own
conviction
that
betty
was
really
kidnapped
that
those
letters
you
have
received
are
from
the
abductors
and
that
through
them
we
must
hope
to
trace
betty
s
present
whereabouts
this
would
not
be
accomplished
by
merely
following
their
instructions
as
to
throwing
money
over
the
cliff
as
you
know
doctor
varian
advises
strongly
against
that
mr
wise
does
too
but
they
have
learned
of
some
more
letters
found
among
your
husband
s
papers
signed
step
and
we
hope
to
prove
a
connection
between
those
and
the
kidnapper
s
what
good
will
that
do
minna
asked
listlessly
oh
zizi
you
re
a
dear
girl
but
you
ve
no
idea
what
i
m
suffering
nights
as
i
lie
awake
in
the
darkness
i
seem
to
hear
my
baby
betty
calling
to
me
seem
to
feel
her
little
arms
round
my
my
mind
goes
back
to
her
baby
days
more
than
to
her
later
that
s
natural
dear
when
you
re
so
anxious
and
worried
about
her
but
truly
i
believe
we
ll
get
her
yet
you
see
everything
points
to
the
theory
that
she
is
i
m
so
tired
of
theories
don
t
help
oh
yes
they
do
dear
now
try
to
get
up
a
little
more
hope
take
it
from
me
ll
see
betty
again
she
ll
come
dancing
in
just
as
she
used
to
do
mrs
varian
why
did
she
and
her
father
squabble
so
i
can
t
explain
it
i
ve
thought
over
it
often
but
it
seems
to
me
there
was
no
reason
for
it
he
admired
betty
he
was
proud
of
her
beauty
and
grace
and
accomplishments
but
there
was
something
in
the
child
that
he
didn
t
like
i
hate
to
say
this
but
he
seemed
to
have
a
natural
dislike
toward
her
that
he
honestly
tried
to
overcome
but
he
utterly
failed
in
the
how
very
strange
it
surely
is
i
ve
never
mentioned
it
to
any
one
before
but
you
are
so
sympathetic
i
want
to
ask
you
what
you
think
could
have
been
the
reason
for
anything
like
that
did
betty
feel
that
way
toward
him
oh
no
i
mean
not
naturally
so
but
when
he
would
fly
at
her
and
scold
her
for
some
little
simple
thing
of
course
she
flared
up
and
talked
back
at
him
it
was
only
petty
bickering
but
it
was
so
wasn
t
mr
varian
pleased
when
he
learned
that
you
expected
another
child
yes
he
was
delighted
he
feared
it
might
not
live
the
others
hadn
t
but
he
was
pleased
beyond
words
at
the
prospect
and
we
both
hoped
for
a
healthy
baby
he
was
so
careful
of
me
devoted
and
loving
and
so
joyful
in
the
anticipation
of
the
new
he
was
with
you
in
vermont
oh
yes
we
had
a
cottage
and
he
stayed
there
while
i
was
in
the
hospital
during
my
confinement
the
house
was
near
by
and
he
could
come
to
see
me
at
any
well
i
can
t
understand
his
turning
against
her
later
do
they
look
alike
no
is
they
have
similar
coloring
but
no
real
betty
doesn
t
look
like
you
either
not
specially
though
i
can
t
see
resemblances
as
some
people
do
she
mrs
varian
well
then
betty
is
a
dear
pretty
girl
healthy
and
happy
but
not
remarkable
in
any
did
she
inherit
your
disposition
or
her
father
s
neither
particularly
but
i
don
t
think
a
young
girl
often
shows
definite
or
strong
traits
of
some
do
zizi
said
thoughtfully
how
about
talents
i
want
to
find
out
you
see
more
of
what
betty
is
she
has
a
little
musical
talent
a
taste
for
drawing
and
a
fondness
for
outdoor
sports
none
of
these
is
marked
i
can
t
describe
the
child
otherwise
than
as
a
natural
normal
everyday
girl
i
adore
her
of
course
but
i
am
not
blind
to
the
fact
that
she
is
not
a
genius
in
any
nor
do
you
want
her
to
be
as
you
ve
told
me
of
her
she
seems
to
me
a
darling
and
i
mean
to
find
her
for
you
for
mr
yes
rodney
loves
her
and
he
is
as
desolate
as
i
am
at
her
loss
oh
zizi
have
you
really
any
hope
or
are
you
just
saying
this
to
comfort
me
i
really
have
hope
and
more
i
have
conviction
that
we
will
yet
have
betty
back
here
but
it
is
not
yet
a
certainty
and
i
only
can
offer
you
my
own
opinions
still
dear
it
s
better
to
hope
than
to
despair
and
any
day
may
bring
us
good
zizi
recounted
this
whole
conversation
to
pennington
wise
not
so
much
because
she
deemed
it
important
as
that
he
wanted
every
word
she
could
get
reported
to
him
the
man
was
frankly
bewildered
it
s
too
ridiculous
he
exclaimed
to
zizi
that
i
pennington
wise
should
have
a
great
a
unique
mystery
as
this
one
is
not
be
able
to
make
one
step
of
progress
toward
its
solution
step
zizi
said
makes
me
think
of
that
person
stephen
or
whatever
his
name
is
let
s
work
from
that
i
ve
tried
and
there
s
no
place
to
start
from
you
see
the
letters
signed
step
are
as
untraceable
as
the
kidnappers
letters
they
re
typed
not
on
the
same
machine
but
on
some
equally
obscure
and
unavailable
one
it
s
impossible
to
hunt
a
typewriter
with
no
suspect
and
no
indication
where
to
look
it
would
be
for
an
ordinary
detective
penny
but
for
that
s
just
it
ziz
an
ordinary
detective
would
say
pooh
of
course
we
can
trace
that
but
i
m
not
an
ordinary
detective
and
my
very
knowledge
and
experience
prove
to
me
how
baffling
search
is
sometimes
i
think
frederick
varian
did
away
with
that
s
rubbish
zizi
said
calmly
but
i
do
think
there
was
some
definite
reason
for
mr
varian
s
attitude
toward
his
no
question
of
her
paternity
good
lord
no
minna
varian
is
the
best
and
sweetest
woman
in
the
world
but
i
ve
a
glimmer
of
a
notion
that
i
can
t
work
out
yet
tell
it
s
too
vague
to
put
into
zizi
knit
her
heavy
eyebrows
and
screwed
up
her
red
lips
and
then
the
carpenters
came
and
the
demolition
of
headland
house
began
it
was
carefully
managed
no
rooms
that
the
family
used
were
put
in
disorder
but
the
kitchen
quarters
and
the
cellar
were
desperately
dug
into
the
kitchen
is
indicated
wise
said
to
doctor
varian
for
it
is
clear
to
my
mind
that
betty
was
carried
out
through
through
the
kitchen
yes
you
see
doctor
we
must
reconstruct
the
matter
like
this
betty
came
back
to
the
house
alone
she
came
in
the
front
door
with
her
father
s
key
now
she
must
have
been
attacked
or
kidnapped
then
and
there
i
mean
whoever
did
it
we
have
to
assume
somebody
did
do
it
in
the
house
waiting
he
was
the
moment
then
say
betty
put
up
a
fight
which
of
course
she
would
then
she
was
carried
off
through
the
kitchen
by
means
of
the
secret
passage
which
we
have
got
to
find
she
had
the
yellow
pillow
in
her
hands
for
some
reason
t
say
she
dropped
it
on
the
kitchen
floor
maybe
the
villain
used
the
pillow
to
stifle
the
girl
s
go
on
said
doctor
varian
briefly
then
owing
to
the
girl
s
struggles
the
string
of
beads
round
her
neck
broke
and
scattered
over
the
only
part
of
yes
the
others
stayed
with
her
or
were
picked
up
by
the
more
than
one
i
think
two
for
when
mr
varian
arrived
upon
the
scene
one
of
them
turned
on
him
killed
him
there
must
have
been
another
to
hold
betty
it
is
possible
there
was
only
one
but
i
doubt
and
you
think
the
concealed
entrance
is
through
the
kitchen
that
or
the
cellar
anyway
there
is
one
and
it
must
be
found
it
was
used
the
night
martha
was
killed
was
used
the
night
north
disappeared
man
it
be
there
i
find
it
true
enough
and
i
hope
you
here
s
something
penny
zizi
said
appearing
suddenly
at
his
elbow
i
ve
found
a
stain
on
my
frock
that
s
exactly
like
the
one
we
noticed
on
poor
martha
s
what
yes
a
green
stain
long
swish
as
of
green
paint
it
isn
t
zizi
held
up
a
little
linen
frock
that
she
sometimes
wore
mornings
on
the
side
down
near
the
hem
was
a
green
smear
and
it
was
similar
in
appearance
to
the
strange
mark
on
the
hand
of
the
dead
girl
where
d
it
come
from
asked
wise
shortly
i
don
t
know
but
it
s
the
dress
i
wore
when
i
was
exploring
the
cellar
and
it
got
pretty
been
washed
no
i
shook
off
and
brushed
off
most
of
the
dirt
but
this
stain
stuck
and
wouldn
t
brush
off
that
s
how
i
noticed
coincidence
i
m
afraid
or
maybe
martha
went
down
cellar
that
night
for
but
what
in
the
cellar
would
make
a
mark
like
that
dunno
ziz
there
s
no
green
paint
down
it
isn
t
paint
penny
zizi
persisted
it
doesn
t
smell
like
what
does
it
smell
like
there
s
no
odor
to
it
that
i
can
notice
but
it
s
a
so
s
the
yellow
pillow
are
the
scattered
beads
was
the
footprint
of
cellar
dust
on
the
library
floor
they
re
all
blind
clues
lead
penny
wise
what
ails
you
i
never
knew
you
so
ready
to
lie
down
on
a
job
no
zizi
not
that
it
s
only
that
i
can
see
how
futile
and
useless
all
these
clues
are
we
ve
got
to
get
some
bigger
evidence
in
fact
we
can
do
nothing
till
we
find
the
way
the
criminal
got
in
and
out
of
this
house
don
t
tease
me
zizi
i
never
was
so
put
about
you
must
be
when
you
revert
to
your
phrases
the
girl
laughed
at
him
but
there
was
deepest
sympathy
in
her
dark
eyes
and
an
affectionate
brooding
glance
told
of
her
anxiety
for
him
yet
the
carpenters
found
nothing
they
proved
beyond
all
possible
doubt
that
there
was
no
secret
passage
between
the
interior
of
headland
house
and
the
outer
world
there
could
be
none
for
every
inch
of
space
was
investigated
and
accounted
for
there
s
no
way
to
get
into
that
house
except
through
its
two
doors
or
its
windows
the
master
carpenter
declared
and
the
men
who
were
watching
knew
he
spoke
the
truth
it
proves
granniss
said
looking
up
from
the
plans
to
the
actual
walls
it
s
all
just
as
this
drawing
shows
it
certainly
is
agreed
doctor
varian
there
s
no
missing
no
said
wise
thoughtfully
there
isn
t
and
at
least
the
carpenters
have
proved
that
there
is
no
secret
passage
built
into
this
house
yet
there
is
one
i
will
find
for
the
first
time
his
words
seemed
to
be
spoken
with
his
own
conviction
of
their
truth
his
voice
had
a
new
ring
eyes
a
new
brightness
and
he
seemed
suddenly
alert
and
powerful
mentally
where
before
his
hearers
had
thought
him
lacking
in
energy
you
ve
thought
of
a
new
way
to
go
about
it
asked
granniss
i
have
it
may
not
work
but
i
ve
a
new
idea
at
least
zizi
let
me
see
that
stained
dress
of
yours
obediently
zizi
brought
her
frock
with
the
smear
still
on
its
hem
wise
looked
at
it
closely
sniffed
it
carefully
and
gave
it
back
saying
if
you
want
to
remove
that
stain
dear
just
wash
it
with
soap
and
water
it
ll
come
off
then
now
i
m
going
down
to
the
village
and
i
may
not
be
back
for
luncheon
don
t
wait
for
he
went
off
and
doctor
varian
said
to
zizi
do
you
think
he
really
has
a
new
theory
or
is
he
just
stalling
for
time
oh
he
s
off
on
a
new
tack
she
said
and
her
eyes
shone
i
know
him
so
well
you
see
i
m
sure
he
has
a
new
idea
and
a
good
one
i
ve
never
seen
him
so
cast
down
and
so
baffled
as
he
has
been
over
this
case
now
that
his
whole
demeanor
is
changed
he
has
a
fresh
start
i
know
and
he
ll
win
out
yet
i
never
doubted
his
success
from
the
beginning
the
last
two
days
he
has
been
at
the
lowest
ebb
of
his
i
have
to
go
back
to
boston
this
afternoon
doctor
varian
went
on
but
i
ll
be
up
again
in
a
few
days
meantime
keep
me
informed
rodney
of
anything
new
that
down
in
the
little
village
of
headland
harbor
pennington
wise
went
first
to
see
claire
blackwood
she
seemed
to
know
more
about
lawrence
north
than
any
one
else
did
yet
even
she
knew
next
to
nothing
no
she
told
the
detective
the
police
haven
t
found
out
anything
definite
about
him
yet
why
don
t
you
take
up
the
search
for
him
mr
wise
i
ve
all
i
can
do
searching
for
betty
varian
he
returned
with
a
rueful
smile
i
m
not
employed
to
hunt
up
north
and
i
am
to
find
miss
varian
but
surely
the
police
can
get
on
the
track
of
him
man
like
that
can
t
drop
out
of
that
s
just
what
he
s
done
though
said
claire
do
you
know
mr
wise
i
believe
lawrence
north
is
a
bigger
man
than
we
supposed
i
mean
a
more
important
one
than
he
himself
admitted
i
think
he
was
up
here
you
mean
that
north
is
not
his
real
name
i
don
t
know
about
that
but
i
mean
that
he
wanted
a
rest
or
wanted
to
get
away
from
everybody
who
knew
him
so
he
came
up
here
to
be
by
himself
how
else
explain
the
fact
that
they
can
t
find
out
anything
about
him
don
t
they
know
his
city
address
yes
but
only
an
office
is
closed
up
for
the
ridiculous
they
ought
to
find
him
all
the
more
easily
if
he
is
a
man
of
i
don
t
mean
of
public
importance
but
i
i
don
t
know
what
but
i
m
sure
there
s
something
mysterious
about
i
m
sure
of
that
too
and
you
know
nothing
of
his
private
life
mrs
blackwood
no
i
ve
heard
that
he
is
a
widower
but
nobody
seems
quite
certain
as
i
told
you
up
here
nobody
questions
one
s
isn
t
it
necessary
before
members
are
taken
into
the
club
oh
yes
but
mr
north
wasn
t
a
member
of
the
club
lots
of
the
summer
people
aren
t
members
but
they
use
the
clubhouse
and
nobody
makes
much
difference
between
members
and
it
isn
t
like
the
more
fashionable
beaches
or
resorts
we
re
a
bit
primitive
up
well
tell
me
of
north
s
financial
standing
he
s
a
rich
man
not
that
i
know
of
but
he
always
has
enough
to
do
what
he
likes
nobody
is
very
rich
up
here
yet
nobody
is
really
poor
we
re
a
lot
in
every
yet
north
owns
a
fine
motor
about
the
best
and
fastest
up
here
but
he
doesn
t
own
it
he
rents
it
by
the
season
most
people
do
i
see
and
that
not
very
pleasant
factotum
of
his
mills
he
a
native
product
no
he
came
up
with
mr
north
he
s
grumpy
i
admit
but
he
s
a
good
sort
after
all
and
devoted
to
his
ah
then
he
must
be
inconsolable
at
north
s
no
on
the
contrary
he
takes
it
calmly
enough
he
says
north
knows
his
own
business
and
will
come
back
when
he
gets
then
he
knows
where
north
he
pretends
he
does
corrected
claire
i
m
not
sure
that
he
is
as
easy
about
the
matter
as
he
pretends
i
saw
him
this
morning
and
i
think
he
is
pretty
well
disturbed
about
it
guess
i
ll
go
to
see
him
thank
you
mrs
blackwood
for
your
patience
and
courtesy
in
answering
my
then
mr
wise
if
you
re
really
grateful
do
tell
me
what
you
think
about
the
varian
affair
that
s
much
more
mysterious
and
much
more
important
than
the
matter
of
lawrence
north
s
disappearance
are
they
connected
it
looks
so
t
it
yes
that
s
no
answer
do
you
think
they
are
i
do
mrs
blackwood
surely
and
pennington
wise
walked
briskly
over
to
the
bungalow
of
lawrence
north
he
found
mills
in
no
kindly
mood
whatcha
want
now
was
his
greeting
and
his
scowl
pointed
his
words
i
want
you
to
take
me
out
for
a
sail
in
mr
north
s
motor
well
you
gotcha
nerve
with
you
what
makes
you
think
i
ll
do
that
because
it
s
for
your
own
best
interests
to
do
wise
looked
the
man
straight
in
the
eye
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
mills
own
gaze
waver
whatcha
mean
by
that
he
growled
truculently
that
if
you
don
t
take
me
i
ll
think
you
have
some
reason
for
i
got
ta
your
work
will
keep
we
ll
be
gone
only
a
few
hours
at
most
how
is
the
tide
now
plumb
come
on
then
we
start
at
whether
mills
decided
it
was
best
for
him
to
consent
to
the
trip
or
whether
he
was
cowed
by
the
detective
s
stern
manner
wise
didn
t
know
and
didn
t
care
but
the
trip
was
made
wise
directed
the
course
and
mills
obeyed
few
words
were
spoken
save
those
necessary
for
information
their
course
lay
out
around
the
headland
and
into
the
small
bay
on
the
other
side
of
it
as
they
rounded
the
cliff
wise
directed
the
other
to
keep
as
close
to
the
shore
as
possible
dangerous
rocks
mills
said
briefly
steer
clear
of
them
said
wise
sternly
after
passing
round
the
headland
on
all
its
exposed
sides
wise
declared
himself
ready
to
return
in
silence
mills
turned
his
craft
about
and
again
wise
told
him
to
make
the
trip
as
close
to
the
rocky
cliff
as
he
could
manage
you
want
to
get
us
into
trouble
asked
mills
as
he
made
a
quick
turn
between
two
treacherous
looking
points
of
rock
i
nearly
struck
then
well
you
didn
t
said
wise
cheerfully
you
re
a
clever
sailor
mills
get
along
back
home
chapter
xv
criminal
or
victim
pennington
wise
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
now
on
hand
the
hardest
job
of
his
life
this
knowledge
did
not
discourage
him
on
the
contrary
it
spurred
him
to
continuous
and
desperate
effort
yet
as
he
told
zizi
his
efforts
consisted
mostly
in
making
inquiries
here
and
there
in
a
hope
that
he
might
learn
something
indicative
it
isn
t
a
case
for
clues
evidence
or
deduction
he
told
her
it
s
hate
the
word
it
s
if
you
can
t
be
logical
be
psychological
said
zizi
flippantly
now
you
know
penny
you
re
going
to
win
if
i
do
it
ll
be
solely
and
merely
because
of
your
faith
in
me
he
said
his
face
beginning
to
show
the
look
of
discouragement
that
she
had
learned
to
dread
that
s
all
right
she
responded
but
this
old
faith
of
mine
while
it
will
never
wear
out
effect
on
you
will
don
t
depend
on
it
too
long
now
let
s
count
up
what
we
ve
really
got
toward
a
we
ve
got
a
lot
began
wise
hopefully
we
know
enough
to
assume
that
betty
varian
was
kidnapped
and
her
father
shot
by
the
same
hand
or
rather
by
orders
of
the
same
master
brain
i
don
t
say
the
criminal
himself
committed
these
crimes
then
we
know
that
our
master
villain
got
in
and
out
of
this
house
his
subordinates
did
means
which
we
haven
t
yet
discovered
but
which
i
am
on
the
trail
oh
penny
are
you
tell
me
where
you
think
it
is
is
it
through
the
kitchen
wait
a
couple
of
days
ziz
i
ll
tell
you
as
soon
as
i
m
certain
in
fact
i
may
have
to
wait
a
week
to
find
out
about
getting
an
expert
on
it
nope
working
it
out
myself
it
all
depends
on
the
oh
penny
i
ve
long
suspected
you
of
being
luny
but
i
didn
t
think
you
d
admit
it
yourself
howsumever
as
long
as
you
re
jocular
i
m
not
discouraged
it
s
when
you
pull
a
long
face
and
heave
great
deep
sighs
that
my
confidence
begins
to
don
t
wobble
yet
then
my
dear
for
when
the
moon
gets
around
to
the
right
quarter
i
ll
show
you
the
secret
way
in
and
out
of
this
it
s
too
bad
of
you
penny
to
spring
those
cryptic
remarks
on
me
save

you

wait
till
the

gets
in
apogee
or
perigee
or
wherever
you

shall
and
meantime
i
m
going
to
track
down
friend
north
he
is
a
factor
in
the
case
whether
sinned
against
or
sinning
that
upset
room
was
never
upset
in
a
real
it
wasn
t
no
ma
am
it
wasn
t
i
ve
been
over
it
again
and
unless
i
m
making
the
mistake
of
my
life
that
upset
chair
was
carefully
and
silently
overturned
by
a
cautious
meaning
north
s
meaning
north
s
of
course
ziz
i
may
be
mistaken
so
i
m
not
advertising
this
yet
but
i
can
t
see
a
real
scuffle
in
that
room
to
begin
with
if
a
man
or
two
men
or
three
men
tried
to
kidnap
lawrence
north
and
carry
him
off
against
his
will
don
t
you
suppose
there
would
be
enough
noise
made
to
wake
some
of
us
maybe
they
chloroformed
maybe
they
did
but
i
m
working
on
a
different
maybe
say
that
man
wanted
to
disappear
and
make
it
look
like
an
abduction
wouldn
t
he
have
done
just
what
he
did
do
leave
the
room
looking
as
if
he
had
gone
off
unwillingly
or
unconsciously
the
very
leaving
of
his
watch
behind
was
a
clever
oh
come
now
penny
i
believe
you
luny
do
you
suspect
lawrence
north
of
all
the
crimes
did
he
abduct
betty
shoot
her
father
martha
and
then
abduct
himself
and
if
so
zizi
you
re
a
bright
little
girl
but
you
don
t
know
everything
now
you
stay
here
and
hold
the
fort
while
i
go
off
for
a
few
days
and
stalk
north
i
don
t
say
he
did
commit
all
that
catalogue
of
crimes
you
string
off
so
glibly
but
i
do
say
that
he
has
to
be
accounted
for
i
must
know
whether
he
is
a
criminal
or
a
wise
went
away
and
the
little
family
at
headland
house
tried
to
possess
their
souls
in
patience
against
his
return
zizi
devoted
herself
to
the
cheer
and
entertainment
of
minna
varian
while
rodney
granniss
found
enough
to
do
in
looking
after
the
accounts
and
financial
matters
of
the
estate
doctor
varian
came
up
again
and
was
both
surprised
and
pleased
to
find
his
brother
s
wife
in
such
a
calm
rational
state
of
mind
yet
it
is
not
a
unique
case
he
said
i
ve
known
other
instances
of
hysterical
and
even
unbalanced
minds
becoming
rational
and
practical
after
a
great
shock
or
and
the
fearful
blows
minna
varian
had
received
from
the
hand
of
fate
did
indeed
seem
to
change
her
whole
nature
and
instead
of
a
pettish
spoiled
woman
she
was
now
quiet
serious
and
mentally
capable
she
kept
herself
buoyed
up
with
a
hope
of
betty
s
return
this
hope
zizi
fostered
and
as
the
days
went
by
it
came
to
be
a
settled
belief
in
minna
s
mind
that
sooner
or
later
her
child
would
be
restored
to
her
waiting
arms
nurse
fletcher
did
not
approve
of
this
state
of
things
at
all
you
know
that
girl
will
never
be
found
she
would
say
to
zizi
you
only
pretend
that
you
think
she
will
and
it
isn
t
right
to
fill
mrs
varian
s
mind
with
fairy
tales
as
you
do
now
nurse
zizi
would
wheedle
her
you
let
me
alone
i
m
sure
mrs
varian
would
collapse
utterly
if
the
hope
of
betty
s
return
were
taken
away
from
her
you
know
she
would
so
don
t
you
dare
say
a
word
that
will
disturb
her
confidence
doctor
varian
agreed
with
zizi
s
ideas
regarding
minna
though
he
said
frankly
he
had
grave
doubts
of
ever
seeing
betty
again
to
my
mind
he
said
as
he
and
zizi
had
a
little
confidential
chat
nothing
has
been
accomplished
nearly
a
month
has
passed
since
betty
disappeared
there
is
no
theory
compatible
with
a
hope
that
she
has
been
kept
safely
and
comfortably
all
that
time
the
kidnappers
there
are
why
doubt
their
existence
because
i
m
not
at
all
sure
that
those
ransom
letters
are
genuine
anybody
could
demand
you
re
not
at
all
sure
of
anything
doctor
varian
zizi
said
and
strictly
speaking
mr
wise
isn
t
either
but
he
is
sure
enough
to
go
away
and
stay
all
this
time
s
been
gone
ten
days
now
and
i
know
unless
he
was
on
a
promising
trail
he
would
have
abandoned
it
before
and
pennington
wise
was
on
a
promising
trail
it
was
proving
a
long
slow
business
but
he
was
making
progress
his
first
start
had
been
from
lawrence
north
s
new
york
office
this
he
found
closed
and
locked
and
no
one
in
attendance
instead
of
bring
disturbed
at
this
he
regarded
it
as
a
step
forward
the
owner
of
the
building
in
which
mr
north
s
office
was
told
the
detective
that
mr
north
had
gone
away
for
the
summer
he
had
said
his
office
would
be
closed
until
september
at
least
and
that
there
was
nothing
doing
wise
persuaded
him
that
there
was
a
great
deal
doing
and
in
the
name
of
justice
and
a
few
other
important
personages
he
must
hand
over
a
key
of
that
office
at
last
this
was
done
and
wise
went
eagerly
about
the
examination
of
lawrence
north
s
books
and
papers
the
fact
that
he
found
nothing
indicative
was
to
him
an
important
indication
north
s
business
evidently
was
of
a
vague
and
sketchy
character
he
seemed
to
have
an
agency
for
two
or
three
inconspicuous
real
estate
firms
and
he
appeared
to
have
put
over
a
few
unimportant
deals
what
was
important
however
was
a
small
advertisement
almost
cut
out
from
a
newspaper
and
almost
overlooked
by
the
detective
this
was
a
few
lines
expressing
somebody
s
desire
to
rent
a
summer
home
on
the
seashore
preferably
on
the
maine
coast
it
was
signed
and
wise
thought
that
it
might
have
been
inserted
by
frederick
varian
he
hadn
t
heard
that
the
varians
took
headland
house
through
the
agency
of
or
at
the
suggestion
of
north
yet
it
might
be
so
at
any
rate
there
was
nothing
else
of
interest
to
wise
in
north
s
whole
office
he
left
no
paper
unread
or
book
unopened
it
took
a
long
time
but
when
it
was
accomplished
the
detective
set
out
on
a
definite
and
determined
search
for
north
the
man
proved
most
elusive
no
one
seemed
to
know
anything
about
him
if
ever
a
negligible
citizen
lived
in
these
united
states
it
was
the
detective
concluded
lawrence
north
he
hunted
directories
and
telephone
books
he
visited
mercantile
agencies
and
information
bureaus
he
had
circulars
already
out
with
a
reward
offered
for
the
missing
man
but
none
of
his
efforts
gave
the
slightest
success
had
he
been
able
to
think
of
north
as
dead
he
could
have
borne
defeat
better
but
he
envisaged
that
nonchalant
face
as
laughing
at
his
futile
search
there
was
of
course
the
possibility
that
north
was
an
assumed
name
and
that
the
true
name
of
the
man
might
bring
about
a
speedy
end
to
his
quest
but
this
was
mere
surmise
and
he
had
no
way
of
verifying
it
by
hunting
down
various
norths
here
and
there
he
one
day
came
upon
a
woman
who
said
why
i
once
knew
a
woman
named
mrs
lawrence
north
she
lived
in
the
same
apartment
house
i
did
and
i
remember
her
because
she
had
the
same
name
no
her
husband
was
no
relation
of
my
husband
husband
has
been
dead
for
was
her
husband
dead
wise
inquired
no
but
he
better
a
been
he
only
came
to
see
her
once
in
a
coon
s
age
he
kept
her
rent
paid
but
he
hardly
gave
her
enough
money
to
live
on
he
was
one
of
these
hifalutin
artistic
temperament
men
and
he
just
neglected
that
poor
thing
somethin
fierce
what
became
of
her
dunno
maybe
she
s
livin
there
to
the
address
given
wise
went
scarcely
daring
to
hope
he
was
on
the
right
track
at
last
at
the
apartment
house
he
was
informed
that
mrs
lawrence
north
had
lived
there
but
that
she
had
also
died
there
about
three
months
previous
the
superintendent
willingly
gave
him
all
the
details
he
asked
and
pennington
wise
concluded
that
the
woman
who
had
died
there
was
without
doubt
the
wife
of
the
lawrence
north
he
was
hunting
for
but
further
information
of
north
s
later
history
he
could
not
gain
after
the
death
of
his
wife
he
had
given
up
the
apartment
which
was
a
furnished
one
and
had
never
been
there
since
wise
cogitated
deeply
over
these
revelations
so
far
he
had
learned
nothing
greatly
to
north
s
discredit
save
that
he
had
not
treated
his
wife
very
well
and
that
he
had
directly
after
her
death
gone
to
a
summer
resort
and
mingled
with
the
society
there
yet
this
latter
fact
was
not
damaging
to
his
knowledge
north
had
in
no
way
acted
up
at
headland
harbor
in
any
way
unbecoming
a
widower
he
had
not
been
called
upon
to
relate
his
private
or
personal
history
and
if
he
had
sought
diversion
among
the
summer
colony
of
artists
and
dilettantes
he
had
of
course
a
right
to
do
so
yet
the
whole
effect
of
the
man
was
suspicious
to
wise
he
told
himself
it
was
prejudice
that
there
was
no
real
evidence
against
him
he
then
thought
if
north
was
a
blameless
undistinguished
private
citizen
why
in
heaven
s
name
would
anybody
want
to
kidnap
him
this
he
answered
to
himself
by
saying
north
might
have
learned
some
secret
of
the
kidnappers
or
of
the
secret
entrance
that
made
it
imperative
for
the
criminals
to
do
away
with
him
this
might
also
explain
the
death
of
the
maid
martha
yet
through
it
all
wise
believed
that
north
was
in
wrong
how
or
to
what
extent
he
didn
t
know
but
north
must
be
found
so
to
the
various
establishments
he
went
until
at
last
he
found
the
one
who
had
had
charge
of
the
obsequies
of
mrs
lawrence
north
that
was
a
red
letter
day
in
the
life
of
pennington
wise
for
though
he
gained
no
knowledge
there
of
his
elusive
quarry
he
did
learn
the
name
and
former
dwelling
place
of
the
woman
north
married
she
had
been
he
discovered
a
widow
and
had
been
born
in
vermont
her
name
when
she
married
north
was
mrs
curtis
and
they
had
been
married
about
ten
years
ago
this
while
not
an
astounding
revelation
was
of
interest
and
at
least
promised
a
further
knowledge
of
north
s
matrimonial
affairs
the
town
in
vermont
was
greenvale
a
small
village
wise
discovered
up
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state
it
was
a
long
trip
but
the
detective
concluded
that
this
case
on
which
he
was
engaged
was
a
case
of
magnificent
distances
and
he
at
once
made
his
railroad
reservations
and
bought
his
tickets
meantime
the
household
at
headland
house
had
been
thrown
into
a
new
spasm
of
excitement
by
the
receipt
of
a
letter
from
a
stranger
it
was
addressed
to
mrs
varian
and
was
of
a
totally
different
character
from
the
frequent
missives
she
received
telling
of
girls
who
looked
like
the
pictures
of
the
advertised
lost
one
this
was
a
well
written
straightforward
message
that
carried
conviction
by
its
very
curtness
it
ran
mrs
varian
dear
madam
i
address
you
regarding
a
peculiar
experience
i
have
just
had
i
am
deaf
therefore
i
never
go
to
the
theatre
as
i
can
t
hear
the
lines
but
i
go
often
to
the
moving
pictures
of
late
i
have
been
taking
lessons
in
lip
reading
and
though
i
have
not
yet
progressed
very
far
in
it
i
can
read
lips
sometimes
especially
if
the
speaker
makes
an
effort
to
form
words
distinctly
now
last
night
i
went
to
the
movies
and
in
a
picture
there
was
a
girl
who
seemed
to
be
speaking
yet
there
was
no
occasion
in
the
story
for
her
to
do
so
she
was
merely
one
of
a
crowd
standing
in
a
meadow
or
field
but
as
practice
in
my
lip
reading
i
watched
her
and
i
am
sure
she
said
i
am
betty
varian
am
betty
this
seemed
so
strange
that
i
went
again
this
afternoon
and
saw
the
picture
again
i
am
sure
that
was
what
she
said
and
over
i
don
t
know
that
this
will
interest
you
but
i
feel
i
ought
to
tell
you
very
truly
yours
ella
sheridan
it
can
t
mean
anything
minna
said
wherever
betty
is
she
isn
t
in
a
moving
picture
company
but
wait
a
minute
cried
granniss
when
they
take
pictures
of
crowds
you
know
a
field
or
meadow
they
pick
up
any
or
any
one
they
can
get
to
fill
even
so
zizi
said
i
can
t
see
it
i
think
somebody
was
talking
about
betty
and
the
girl
read
the
lips
wrong
she
s
only
a
beginner
she
says
i
ve
heard
it
s
a
most
difficult
thing
to
i
don
t
care
granniss
said
it
s
got
to
be
looked
into
i
m
going
to
answer
this
letter
i
m
going
straight
down
there
it
s
from
portland
and
i
m
going
to
see
that
picture
make
sure
it
s
still
being
shown
said
the
practical
zizi
i
ll
telegraph
and
ask
her
cried
rodney
his
face
alight
at
the
thought
of
doing
some
real
work
himself
oh
don
t
go
rod
minna
said
i
can
t
get
along
without
you
what
good
will
it
do
you
know
a
picture
isn
t
the
real
people
it
s
all
too
vague
and
no
it
isn
t
granniss
insisted
it
s
the
first
real
clue
why
didn
t
that
girl
notice
what
the
girl
in
the
picture
looked
like
oh
of
course
i
must
go
i
can
get
to
portland
and
back
in
three
days
i
ve
got
to
go
and
go
he
did
the
picture
was
still
on
at
the
theater
and
with
a
beating
heart
rodney
took
his
seat
to
watch
it
he
could
scarce
wait
for
the
preliminary
scenes
he
knew
no
bit
of
the
plot
or
what
happened
to
the
characters
he
sat
tense
and
watchful
for
the
appearance
of
the
crowd
on
the
meadow
at
last
it
came
he
nearly
sprang
from
his
seat
betty
betty
varian
herself
could
not
be
mistaken
she
wore
a
simple
gingham
frock
a
plain
straw
hat
and
had
no
sign
of
the
smartness
that
always
characterized
betty
s
clothes
but
he
could
not
be
deceived
in
that
face
that
dear
lovely
face
of
betty
herself
and
he
saw
her
lips
were
moving
he
could
not
read
them
as
the
girl
who
told
of
it
had
done
but
he
imagined
she
said
i
am
betty
varian
am
betty
yet
her
face
was
expressionless
eager
air
of
imparting
information
no
apparent
interest
in
the
scene
about
her
face
in
the
screen
seemed
like
that
of
an
automaton
saying
the
words
as
if
from
a
lesson
rod
couldn
t
understand
it
he
feared
that
it
was
merely
a
chance
likeness
had
heard
of
exact
doubles
as
the
scene
passed
and
the
crowd
on
the
meadow
returned
no
more
to
the
story
he
left
his
seat
and
went
in
search
of
the
owner
of
the
theater
but
all
his
questioning
failed
to
elicit
any
information
as
to
the
scene
or
where
it
was
taken
the
theatrical
manager
arranged
for
his
picture
through
an
agent
and
knew
nothing
of
the
company
that
took
it
or
the
author
of
the
play
the
next
morning
rodney
tried
again
to
locate
the
producer
but
failing
decided
to
return
home
and
put
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
pennington
wise
he
was
sure
the
girl
on
the
screen
was
betty
yet
had
he
been
told
authoritatively
that
it
was
not
he
could
believe
himself
the
victim
of
a
case
of
mistaken
identity
he
related
his
experiences
to
minna
and
zizi
and
they
both
felt
there
was
little
to
hope
for
as
a
result
you
see
zizi
explained
it
when
those
crowds
are
picked
up
at
random
that
way
they
are
always
chatting
about
their
own
affairs
now
it
may
well
be
this
girl
had
been
reading
the
circulars
about
betty
also
she
may
have
been
told
how
much
she
looked
like
her
and
that
would
explain
her
speaking
the
name
and
except
for
the
actual
name
i
don
t
believe
the
ella
sheridan
person
read
it
i
don
t
either
minna
agreed
i
wish
i
could
see
something
in
it
rod
but
it
s
too
absurd
to
think
of
betty
in
the
moving
pictures
even
by
chance
as
you
say
and
too
where
could
she
be
that
she
would
saunter
out
and
join
in
a
public
picture
like
that
i
know
it
seems
utterly
absurd
was
betty
was
it
when
will
mr
wise
be
back
zizi
i
had
a
letter
this
morning
and
he
says
not
to
expect
him
before
the
end
of
the
week
at
least
he
is
on
an
important
trail
and
has
to
go
to
a
distant
town
then
he
will
come
back
oh
i
want
to
consult
him
about
this
thing
and
rodney
looked
disconsolate
work
at
it
yourself
rod
zizi
advised
him
get
lists
of
the
picture
making
companies
write
to
them
all
and
track
down
that
film
it
must
be
a
possible
thing
to
do
go
to
it
i
will
rodney
declared
and
forthwith
set
about
it
now
i
want
to
go
off
on
a
little
trip
zizi
said
to
minna
and
i
don
t
want
to
say
where
i
m
going
for
it
may
turn
out
a
wild
goose
chase
the
idea
is
not
a
very
big
one
it
might
be
the
means
of
finding
out
a
lot
of
the
mystery
anyway
i
want
to
go
and
i
ll
be
back
in
three
days
or
four
at
i
hate
to
have
you
leave
me
zizi
mrs
varian
answered
but
if
it
means
a
chance
why
take
it
get
back
as
soon
as
you
can
i
ve
grown
to
depend
on
you
for
all
my
help
and
so
zizi
packed
her
bag
and
departed
with
her
she
took
a
letter
that
she
had
abstracted
from
a
drawer
of
minna
varian
s
she
had
taken
it
without
leave
indeed
without
the
owner
s
knowledge
but
she
felt
the
end
justified
the
means
if
indeed
the
end
amounts
to
anything
zizi
thought
a
little
ruefully
once
started
on
her
journey
it
seemed
like
a
wilder
goose
chase
than
it
had
at
first
appeared
the
route
the
little
new
england
railroad
took
her
inland
into
the
state
of
maine
and
then
westward
until
she
was
in
the
green
hills
and
valleys
of
vermont
it
was
when
the
conductor
sung
out
greenvale
that
zizi
her
journey
ended
alighted
from
the
train
she
found
a
rickety
old
conveyance
known
as
a
buckboard
and
asked
the
indifferent
driver
thereof
if
she
might
be
conveyed
to
any
inn
or
hostelry
that
greenvale
might
boast
still
taciturn
the
lanky
youth
that
held
the
horse
told
her
to
get
zizi
got
in
and
was
transported
to
a
small
inn
that
was
not
half
so
bad
as
she
had
feared
she
paid
her
charioteer
and
as
he
set
her
bag
down
for
her
on
the
porch
she
went
into
the
first
room
which
seemed
to
be
the
office
can
i
have
a
room
for
a
day
or
two
she
asked
sure
said
the
affable
clerk
looking
at
her
with
undisguised
admiration
zizi
smiled
at
him
quite
completing
his
subjugation
for
she
wished
to
be
friendly
in
order
to
get
all
the
help
she
could
on
her
mission
she
registered
and
then
said
greenvale
is
a
lovely
place
how
large
is
it
most
three
thousand
said
the
clerk
proudly
gained
a
lot
of
do
you
have
many
visitors
in
the
summer
lots
and
we
ve
got
a
noted
one
here
right
who
nobody
less
here
he
comes
now
and
zizi
looked
toward
the
door
and
just
entering
she
saw
wise
chapter
xvi
in
greenvale
for
the
love
of
mike
zizi
what
are
you
doing
here
exclaimed
pennington
wise
nearly
struck
dumb
with
astonishment
at
sight
of
the
girl
i
ask
you
that
she
returned
looking
at
him
with
equal
amazement
well
anyway
i
m
glad
to
see
you
he
smiled
at
her
with
real
pleasure
i
ve
had
a
long
horrid
and
most
unsatisfactory
quest
for
the
elusive
and
i
haven
t
found
him
any
hope
of
it
nothing
but
i
mean
no
expectation
or
certainty
always
hope
now
what
s
your
lay
tell
me
you
re
here
or
i
ll
fly
off
the
handle
well
wait
till
we
can
sit
down
somewhere
and
talk
comfortably
i
haven
t
had
a
room
assigned
to
me
but
tell
me
this
you
re
here
on
the
varian
case
yes
of
course
are
you
i
am
oh
girl
there
must
be
something
doing
when
we
re
here
from
different
starting
points
and
for
different
reasons
i
m
here
because
of
some
revelations
of
mrs
varian
zizi
said
and
wise
stared
at
her
mrs
varian
he
exclaimed
i
say
ziz
go
to
your
room
get
your
bag
unpacked
and
your
things
put
away
as
quick
as
you
can
won
t
you
and
then
let
s
zizi
darted
away
she
arranged
to
have
a
bedroom
and
that
she
could
call
her
own
for
a
few
days
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
she
was
receiving
wise
in
her
tiny
but
pleasant
domain
now
he
said
tell
me
your
it
isn
t
much
of
a
story
zizi
admitted
but
i
came
here
because
this
is
where
betty
varian
was
up
here
in
greenvale
vermont
yes
a
little
hospital
and
what
has
that
fact
to
do
with
betty
s
disappearance
oh
penny
i
don
t
know
but
i
hope
believe
it
has
something
well
my
child
i
m
up
here
to
investigate
the
early
life
of
mrs
lawrence
then
we
are
most
certainly
brought
to
the
same
place
by
totally
different
clues
they
are
clues
and
one
or
both
of
them
prove
successful
who
was
she
penny
as
near
as
i
can
find
out
she
was
a
widow
when
north
married
her
her
name
was
then
mrs
curtis
her
maiden
name
i
don
t
well
what
s
the
procedure
the
procedure
as
wise
mapped
it
out
was
to
go
to
the
hospital
first
and
see
what
could
be
learned
concerning
mrs
varian
s
stay
there
twenty
years
ago
they
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
an
interview
with
the
superintendent
of
the
institution
but
as
wise
had
feared
he
was
not
the
man
who
had
been
in
charge
a
score
of
years
previous
in
fact
there
had
been
several
changes
since
and
the
present
incumbent
one
doctor
hasbrook
showed
but
slight
interest
in
his
callers
questions
the
hospital
is
only
years
old
hasbrook
said
so
the
patient
you
re
looking
up
must
have
been
here
soon
after
it
was
you
have
the
records
i
suppose
asked
wise
yes
you
care
to
hunt
them
over
they
are
at
your
as
a
result
of
this
permission
wise
and
zizi
spent
several
hours
looking
over
the
old
and
not
very
carefully
kept
records
of
the
earliest
years
of
the
little
country
hospital
the
worst
of
it
is
said
zizi
i
don
t
exactly
know
what
we
re
hoping
to
find
do
you
i
have
a
dim
idea
zizi
and
it
s
getting
clearer
wise
replied
speaking
as
from
a
deep
absorption
here
s
what
it
s
a
list
of
births
for
a
year
year
betty
varian
was
born
and
zizi
the
very
same
night
that
mrs
varian
s
baby
was
born
a
mrs
curtis
also
bore
a
child
well
oh
don
t
sit
there
and
babble
what
and
well
can
t
you
see
no
i
can
well
wait
a
bit
let
me
see
miss
morton
m
black
pennington
wise
if
you
ve
lost
your
mind
i
ll
take
you
to
a
modern
sanitarium
don
t
want
to
go
off
and
leave
you
here
in
this
little
hospital
hush
up
zizi
don
t
chatter
miss
morton
zizi
kept
silent
in
utter
exasperation
she
knew
wise
well
enough
to
be
sure
he
was
on
the
trail
of
a
real
discovery
but
her
impatience
could
scarcely
stand
his
mutterings
and
his
air
of
suppressed
excitement
however
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
for
his
further
elucidation
and
when
at
last
he
closed
the
books
and
looked
up
at
her
his
face
was
fairly
transfigured
with
joyous
expectancy
come
on
girl
he
cried
come
he
rose
and
as
zizi
followed
they
went
back
to
the
superintendent
s
office
can
you
tell
us
doctor
hasbrook
wise
asked
where
we
can
find
two
nurses
who
were
here
twenty
years
ago
one
was
named
black
and
one
this
was
a
matter
of
definite
record
and
hasbrook
soon
informed
them
that
nurse
black
had
died
some
years
ago
but
that
nurse
morton
had
married
and
was
still
living
in
greenvale
thank
heaven
murmured
wise
as
he
took
the
address
of
mrs
briggs
who
had
been
nurse
morton
to
her
house
they
then
went
zizi
now
quite
content
to
trudge
along
by
the
detective
s
side
without
asking
further
questions
she
knew
she
would
learn
all
in
due
time
the
pretty
little
cottage
which
was
the
home
of
mrs
briggs
they
found
and
went
through
the
wooden
picket
gate
and
up
to
the
front
door
something
tells
me
she
won
t
be
glad
to
see
us
wise
whispered
and
then
they
were
admitted
by
a
woman
who
answered
wise
s
courteous
question
by
stating
that
she
was
mrs
briggs
she
looked
amiable
enough
zizi
thought
and
she
asked
her
callers
to
be
seated
in
her
homely
but
comfortable
i
am
here
wise
began
watching
her
face
for
any
expression
of
alarm
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
about
some
cases
you
attended
when
you
were
a
nurse
in
the
greenvale
yes
sir
was
the
response
but
zizi
s
quick
eye
noticed
the
woman
s
fingers
grasp
tightly
the
corner
of
her
apron
which
she
rolled
and
twisted
nervously
one
case
especially
was
that
of
a
mrs
varian
you
remember
it
no
do
not
mrs
briggs
replied
but
it
was
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
and
she
spoke
in
a
low
uncertain
voice
oh
yes
you
do
and
wise
looked
at
her
sternly
mrs
frederick
varian
lovely
lady
who
gave
birth
to
a
girl
child
and
you
were
her
no
i
don
t
remember
any
mrs
the
voice
was
steadier
now
but
the
speaker
kept
her
eyes
averted
from
the
detective
s
face
your
memory
is
defective
he
said
quietly
do
you
then
remember
a
mrs
curtis
this
shot
went
home
and
mrs
briggs
cried
out
excitedly
what
do
you
mean
who
are
you
you
haven
t
been
asked
anything
about
these
people
for
twenty
years
have
you
wise
went
on
you
didn
t
think
you
ever
would
be
asked
about
them
did
you
your
memory
is
all
right
what
have
you
to
i
have
nothing
to
say
i
remember
a
mrs
curtis
but
she
was
not
my
no
mrs
varian
was
your
patient
but
mrs
curtis
figured
in
the
varian
case
pretty
largely
i
should
say
mrs
briggs
broke
down
i
didn
t
do
any
harm
she
said
i
only
did
what
i
was
told
i
obeyed
the
others
who
were
in
greater
authority
than
i
she
buried
her
face
in
her
apron
and
sobbed
that
s
right
mrs
briggs
wise
said
kindly
tell
the
truth
and
i
promise
you
it
will
be
far
better
for
you
in
the
long
run
than
to
make
up
any
tell
me
what
happened
the
woman
said
eagerly
as
she
wiped
her
eyes
oh
sir
tell
me
did
varian
s
little
girl
live
to
grow
up
mrs
little
girl
wise
repeated
with
a
strange
intonation
and
a
shrewd
shake
of
his
head
yes
mrs
varian
s
little
girl
the
woman
insisted
obstinately
they
took
the
child
away
when
it
was
four
weeks
old
mrs
varian
was
quite
well
and
happy
of
course
she
was
were
you
happy
why
not
the
words
were
defiant
but
mrs
briggs
face
showed
an
involuntary
fear
come
now
mrs
briggs
tell
me
the
whole
story
and
you
will
get
off
scot
free
keep
back
the
truth
or
any
portion
of
the
truth
and
you
will
find
yourself
in
most
serious
trouble
which
do
you
choose
where
are
the
varians
where
is
mr
varian
mr
varian
is
dead
you
have
me
to
reckon
with
instead
of
him
oh
i
begin
to
see
was
it
mr
varian
s
scheme
yes
it
was
i
told
you
i
had
no
choice
in
the
because
he
paid
you
well
now
are
you
going
to
tell
me
or
must
i
drag
the
story
from
you
i
ll
tell
it
all
then
begin
at
the
the
beginning
was
merely
that
the
varians
were
spending
the
summer
here
in
a
little
cottage
over
on
the
next
street
to
this
mrs
varian
was
expecting
a
confinement
but
hoped
to
get
back
to
the
city
before
it
took
place
however
she
was
not
well
and
mr
varian
brought
her
to
the
hospital
for
consultation
and
treatment
i
was
her
nurse
and
i
came
to
know
her
well
love
her
she
was
a
dear
lady
and
as
her
first
babies
had
died
in
infancy
she
was
greatly
worried
and
anxious
lest
this
new
baby
should
be
sickly
or
worse
should
be
born
dead
mr
varian
was
the
most
devoted
husband
i
ever
saw
he
put
up
with
all
his
wife
s
whims
and
tantrums
she
was
full
of
them
he
indulged
and
petted
her
all
the
time
he
was
quite
as
anxious
as
she
for
a
healthy
child
and
when
they
discovered
that
she
must
remain
here
for
her
confinement
he
sent
to
town
for
all
sorts
of
things
to
make
her
comfortable
and
happy
well
baby
was
born
it
was
born
dead
mrs
varian
did
not
know
it
and
when
i
told
mr
varian
he
was
so
disappointed
i
thought
he
would
go
off
his
head
now
there
was
another
case
in
the
hospital
that
was
a
very
sad
matter
it
was
mrs
curtis
she
poor
woman
was
confined
that
same
night
and
her
baby
was
born
fine
and
healthy
but
she
didn
t
want
the
child
she
was
so
poor
she
scarce
could
keep
soul
and
body
together
she
had
three
little
children
already
and
her
husband
had
died
by
accident
only
a
month
before
how
to
care
for
a
new
little
one
she
didn
t
know
it
was
nurse
black
who
thought
of
the
plan
of
substituting
the
lovely
curtis
child
for
the
dead
varian
baby
and
we
proposed
it
to
mr
varian
to
our
surprise
he
fairly
jumped
at
it
he
begged
us
to
ascertain
if
mrs
curtis
would
agree
saying
he
would
pay
her
well
now
mrs
curtis
was
only
too
grateful
to
be
assured
of
a
good
home
and
care
for
her
child
and
willingly
gave
it
over
to
the
varians
but
mrs
varian
never
knew
that
was
mr
varian
s
idea
and
it
was
an
honest
and
true
desire
to
please
his
wife
and
to
provide
her
with
a
healthy
child
such
as
she
herself
could
never
bear
i
think
mr
varian
was
decided
at
the
last
by
the
piteous
cries
of
mrs
varian
for
her
baby
when
he
heard
her
he
said
quickly
take
the
curtis
child
to
her
see
if
she
accepts
it
and
did
she
asked
zizi
her
eyes
shining
at
the
dramatic
story
oh
she
did
she
cried
out
in
joy
that
it
was
her
baby
and
a
beautiful
healthy
child
and
she
was
so
pleased
and
happy
and
contented
that
she
dropped
off
into
a
fine
natural
sleep
and
began
to
get
well
at
once
when
she
wakened
she
asked
for
the
child
and
so
it
went
on
until
there
was
no
question
what
to
do
the
whole
matter
was
considered
who
knew
of
the
fraud
asked
wise
no
one
in
the
world
but
mrs
curtis
mr
varian
and
we
two
nurses
mr
varian
paid
the
poor
mother
ten
thousand
dollars
and
he
gave
us
a
thousand
dollars
apiece
the
authorities
of
the
hospital
never
knew
they
assumed
the
dead
child
was
mrs
curtis
and
the
living
child
was
mrs
varian
and
the
doctors
there
was
but
one
i
forgot
him
yes
he
knew
but
he
was
a
greedy
scamp
and
mr
varian
easily
bought
him
over
he
died
soon
after
so
that
now
living
people
know
of
this
thing
say
mr
varian
is
dead
and
mrs
varian
never
learned
the
truth
no
zizi
answered
emphatically
she
never
and
nurse
black
is
dead
and
the
doctor
is
dead
then
nobody
knows
yes
mrs
curtis
of
she
too
is
dead
wise
said
then
nobody
knows
it
but
we
three
here
unless
of
course
mr
varian
or
mrs
curtis
mr
varian
never
did
wise
said
as
to
mrs
curtis
i
can
t
oh
she
d
never
tell
mrs
briggs
declared
she
was
honest
in
the
whole
matter
she
said
she
didn
t
know
how
she
d
support
her
three
children
let
alone
a
fourth
and
she
was
glad
and
thankful
to
have
it
brought
up
among
rich
and
kind
people
she
never
would
have
let
it
go
unless
she
had
been
sure
of
their
kindness
and
care
but
we
told
her
what
fine
people
the
varians
were
and
she
was
were
there
adoption
papers
taken
out
mrs
briggs
stared
at
wise
s
question
why
no
it
wasn
t
an
adoption
it
was
a
substitution
how
could
there
be
an
adoption
mrs
varian
thought
it
her
own
child
authorities
of
the
hospital
thought
the
living
child
was
mrs
varian
s
the
matter
was
kept
a
perfect
and
i
think
it
was
all
right
zizi
defended
so
long
as
mr
varian
knew
so
long
as
mrs
curtis
was
satisfied
i
don
t
see
where
any
harm
was
done
to
i
don
t
either
miss
said
mrs
briggs
eagerly
i
m
gratified
to
hear
you
say
that
and
i
hope
sir
you
feel
the
same
way
about
why
i
scarcely
know
what
to
say
wise
returned
it
depends
on
whether
you
view
the
whole
thing
from
a
or
from
a
viewpoint
of
common
sense
and
zizi
said
i
think
it
was
fine
i
m
only
sorry
for
poor
mr
varian
who
had
to
bear
the
weight
of
his
secret
all
alone
through
oh
zizi
that
would
explain
the
pearls
wise
cried
of
course
it
does
he
had
to
leave
them
to
a
varian
betty
wasn
t
a
varian
penny
what
a
situation
that
poor
man
and
it
explains
a
lot
of
other
things
wise
said
thoughtfully
well
mrs
briggs
we
ll
be
going
now
as
to
this
matter
i
think
i
can
say
if
you
ll
continue
to
keep
it
secret
we
will
do
the
same
at
least
for
the
present
did
you
never
tell
anybody
not
even
your
husband
i
never
did
it
was
the
only
secret
i
ever
kept
from
my
husband
he
s
dead
now
this
seven
year
poor
man
i
felt
i
couldn
t
tell
him
it
wasn
t
my
secret
when
i
took
mr
varian
s
money
i
promised
never
to
tell
about
the
child
and
i
kept
my
word
until
now
she
added
and
wise
said
you
had
to
tell
now
mrs
briggs
if
you
hadn
t
told
willingly
and
frankly
i
could
have
brought
the
law
to
bear
on
your
that
s
what
i
thought
sir
please
tell
me
of
the
child
is
she
now
a
fine
girl
wise
realized
that
up
in
this
far
away
hamlet
the
news
of
betty
varian
s
disappearance
had
not
become
known
so
he
merely
said
i
ve
never
seen
her
but
i
m
told
she
is
a
fine
and
lovely
girl
her
mother
is
a
charming
i
m
glad
you
say
so
sir
for
though
i
was
sorry
for
her
she
was
a
terror
for
peevishness
and
fretting
yet
after
she
got
the
little
girl
she
seemed
transformed
she
was
that
happy
and
back
to
the
inn
went
pennington
wise
and
zizi
the
most
astonishing
revelation
i
ever
heard
was
wise
s
comment
as
he
closed
the
door
of
zizi
s
sitting
room
and
sat
down
to
talk
it
over
where
do
you
come
out
at
all
sorts
of
unexpected
places
now
zizi
have
you
realized
yet
that
lawrence
north
married
that
mrs
curtis
you
re
sure
practically
he
married
a
widow
named
curtis
who
formerly
lived
in
greenvale
vermont
i
ve
not
struck
any
other
and
besides
it
connects
north
with
this
whole
varian
case
and
i
m
sure
he
is
mixed
up
in
but
how
that
s
the
question
but
here
s
a
more
immediate
question
zizi
are
we
to
tell
mrs
varian
what
we
have
learned
from
the
nurse
up
here
how
can
we
help
telling
her
but
think
zizi
have
we
a
right
to
divulge
frederick
varian
s
secret
after
he
spent
his
life
keeping
it
quiet
shall
we
be
justified
in
blurting
it
oh
penny
that
s
why
mr
varian
and
betty
were
at
odds
she
wasn
t
his
she
didn
t
know
no
but
he
did
and
it
made
him
irritable
and
impatient
oh
don
t
you
see
he
was
everlastingly
thinking
that
her
traits
were
not
varian
traits
nor
traits
of
her
mother
s
family
he
couldn
t
help
thinking
of
the
child
s
real
mother
oh
i
can
see
how
altogether
he
was
upset
over
and
over
again
when
betty
would
do
or
say
something
that
he
didn
t
approve
yes
that
s
so
zizi
here
s
a
more
important
revelation
the
reason
frederick
varian
was
so
opposed
to
betty
s
marrying
was
because
he
found
himself
in
such
an
equivocal
position
he
couldn
t
let
her
marry
a
decent
man
without
telling
him
the
story
of
her
birth
he
couldn
t
tell
it
he
couldn
t
tell
the
young
man
without
telling
his
wife
to
tell
mrs
varian
this
late
date
well
no
wonder
the
poor
father
was
no
father
nearly
distracted
no
wonder
he
was
crusty
and
snappish
at
betty
of
course
the
poor
girl
was
in
no
way
to
blame
wouldn
t
you
think
mrs
varian
would
have
suspected
no
why
should
she
and
too
her
husband
took
good
care
that
she
shouldn
t
it
s
a
truly
marvelous
situation
chapter
xvii
the
last
letter
when
wise
and
zizi
returned
to
headland
house
they
found
doctor
varian
there
on
one
of
his
brief
visits
deciding
that
it
was
the
best
course
to
pursue
the
detective
took
the
physician
entirely
into
his
confidence
the
two
were
closeted
in
the
library
and
wise
related
his
discoveries
regarding
the
vermont
hospital
it
is
astounding
incredible
exclaimed
varian
but
if
true
and
it
must
be
true
it
explains
a
great
many
things
as
a
doctor
i
can
understand
these
things
and
looking
back
i
see
that
betty
never
had
any
traits
of
either
parent
not
always
are
children
like
their
parents
but
i
ve
never
seen
a
case
where
there
was
not
some
sign
of
heredity
some
likeness
to
father
or
mother
in
looks
or
character
but
betty
showed
none
such
she
was
a
dear
girl
and
we
all
loved
her
she
was
not
in
any
way
like
fred
or
minna
to
be
sure
i
never
thought
about
this
definitely
for
i
had
no
reason
to
think
of
such
a
thing
as
you
re
telling
me
but
recollecting
betty
for
i
ve
known
her
all
her
life
i
can
see
where
she
is
of
a
totally
different
stamp
from
my
brother
or
his
wife
my
what
a
case
do
you
blame
mr
varian
not
a
bit
he
did
it
out
of
the
kindest
of
motives
he
was
not
only
a
devoted
husband
but
a
willing
slave
to
his
wife
even
in
cases
where
she
was
unreasonable
or
he
petted
and
humored
her
in
every
imaginable
way
and
when
the
third
baby
was
expected
the
poor
man
was
nearly
frantic
lest
it
should
not
live
and
minna
could
not
bear
the
disappointment
and
so
when
as
it
seems
by
a
mere
chance
he
had
an
opportunity
to
provide
her
with
a
strong
healthy
beautiful
child
for
one
am
not
surprised
that
he
did
so
nor
do
i
greatly
blame
him
as
you
represent
it
the
poor
mother
was
willing
and
glad
to
consent
to
the
arrangement
an
adoption
would
have
been
perfectly
legitimate
and
proper
fred
only
chose
the
substitution
plan
to
save
minna
from
trouble
and
worry
i
know
fred
so
well
he
was
impulsive
and
he
stopped
at
nothing
to
please
or
comfort
his
wife
so
i
can
easily
see
how
he
decided
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
to
do
this
thing
and
if
as
you
say
minna
took
to
the
child
at
once
and
loved
it
as
her
own
of
course
he
felt
that
the
plan
must
be
kept
up
the
deception
must
be
it
accounts
i
dare
say
for
the
slight
friction
that
so
frequently
arose
between
betty
and
her
father
we
may
as
well
continue
to
call
him
her
it
does
i
suppose
when
the
child
exhibited
traits
that
annoyed
or
displeased
fred
he
resented
it
and
he
couldn
t
help
showing
it
he
had
a
strong
clannish
feeling
about
the
varians
and
he
was
sensitive
to
many
slight
faults
in
betty
that
minna
never
gave
any
heed
it
s
an
interesting
study
in
the
relative
values
of
heredity
and
yes
it
is
and
it
proves
my
own
theory
which
is
that
their
influences
average
about
many
times
heredity
is
stronger
than
environment
and
often
it
s
the
other
way
but
oftenest
of
all
as
in
this
case
the
one
offsets
the
other
i
know
nothing
of
betty
s
real
ancestry
but
it
must
have
been
fairly
good
or
fred
never
would
have
taken
her
at
and
it
was
of
course
his
clannish
loyalty
to
his
family
name
that
would
not
let
him
leave
the
pearls
to
yes
they
have
always
been
left
to
a
varian
and
fred
couldn
t
leave
them
to
one
who
was
really
an
it
also
explains
mr
varian
s
objections
to
betty
s
oh
it
does
poor
man
what
he
must
have
suffered
he
was
a
nature
impulsive
and
even
impetuous
but
of
a
sound
impeccable
honesty
that
wouldn
t
brook
a
shadow
of
wrong
to
any
i
suppose
what
he
had
done
troubled
him
more
or
less
all
his
i
suppose
so
not
his
conscience
can
see
how
he
looked
on
his
deed
as
right
he
was
bothered
by
circumstances
it
was
a
difficult
situation
that
he
had
created
the
more
i
realize
it
the
sorrier
i
feel
for
my
poor
brother
to
make
his
will
was
a
perplexity
his
lawyer
has
told
me
that
when
he
left
the
pearls
away
from
betty
he
said
i
do
it
i
to
do
it
in
a
voice
that
was
fairly
agonized
the
lawyer
couldn
t
understand
what
he
meant
but
assumed
it
was
some
cloud
on
betty
s
birth
i
daresay
fred
was
not
bothered
about
his
money
for
he
knew
if
he
died
first
minna
would
provide
for
betty
but
the
pearls
he
had
to
arrange
for
oh
well
mr
wise
now
then
viewed
in
the
light
of
these
revelations
where
do
we
stand
who
killed
my
brother
who
killed
the
maid
martha
who
kidnapped
betty
and
mr
north
those
are
not
easy
questions
doctor
varian
wise
responded
with
a
grave
face
but
of
this
i
am
confident
name
will
answer
them
you
know
the
name
i
am
not
quite
sure
enough
yet
to
say
that
i
do
i
have
a
strong
suspicion
i
think
it
is
the
man
who
wrote
the
blackmailing
letters
to
mr
the
man
we
call
stephen
it
well
may
be
they
referred
to
a
robbed
woman
now
my
brother
never
robbed
anybody
in
the
commonly
accepted
sense
of
that
term
but
it
may
mean
the
mother
of
betty
could
the
doctor
in
the
greenvale
hospital
that
attended
the
two
women
that
night
be
trying
to
make
money
out
of
the
matter
they
tell
me
he
died
some
years
but
these
letters
are
not
all
recent
and
too
he
might
have
divulged
the
secret
before
he
died
and
whoever
he
told
used
it
as
a
threat
against
my
it
s
hardly
a
blackmailing
oh
yes
it
is
say
the
doctor
the
doctor
s
confidant
threatened
fred
with
exposure
of
the
secret
of
betty
s
birth
i
know
my
brother
well
enough
to
be
certain
that
he
would
pay
large
sums
before
he
would
bring
on
minna
and
betty
the
shock
and
publicity
even
though
there
was
no
actual
well
then
granting
a
blackmailer
he
s
the
one
to
look
for
but
on
the
other
hand
why
should
he
kill
mr
varian
when
he
was
his
hope
of
financial
plunder
why
should
he
kidnap
betty
and
above
all
why
should
he
kill
martha
and
abduct
lawrence
north
the
only
one
of
those
very
pertinent
questions
that
i
can
answer
is
the
one
about
betty
whoever
kidnapped
her
did
it
for
ransom
that
is
evidenced
by
the
letters
to
if
they
are
oh
they
are
m
sure
she
had
another
while
you
were
she
did
to
what
purport
further
and
more
desperate
insistence
of
the
ransom
the
regular
procedure
if
it
is
a
fake
they
would
do
the
same
yes
they
would
also
if
it
is
a
real
wise
went
at
once
to
find
minna
and
see
the
new
letter
it
was
indeed
imperative
saying
in
part
now
we
have
betty
safe
but
this
is
your
last
chance
to
get
her
back
we
are
too
smart
for
your
wise
detective
and
we
are
in
dead
earnest
also
betty
will
be
dead
in
earnest
unless
you
do
exactly
as
we
herein
direct
also
this
is
our
last
letter
if
you
decide
against
us
we
settle
betty
s
account
and
call
the
whole
deal
off
our
instructions
are
the
same
as
before
on
friday
night
at
midnight
go
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
throw
the
package
of
money
over
tie
to
it
some
float
and
we
will
do
the
rest
that
is
if
you
act
in
sincerity
if
you
are
in
the
least
detail
we
will
know
it
we
are
wiser
than
wise
so
take
your
choice
and
a
care
no
one
will
be
more
faithful
than
we
if
you
act
in
good
faith
also
no
one
can
be
worse
than
we
can
be
if
you
betray
us
the
somewhat
lengthy
letter
was
written
on
the
same
typewriter
as
had
been
used
for
the
others
and
wise
studied
it
there
s
nothing
to
be
deduced
from
the
materials
he
said
they
re
too
smart
to
use
traceable
paper
or
typing
but
there
are
other
indications
and
i
think
mrs
varian
at
last
i
see
a
ray
of
hope
and
i
trust
it
will
soon
be
a
bright
gleam
and
then
full
sunshine
good
zizi
cried
clapping
her
hands
when
penny
talks
poetry
he
s
in
high
good
humor
when
he
s
in
high
good
humor
it
s
cause
he
s
on
the
right
track
when
he
s
on
the
right
track
gets
there
then
they
told
wise
about
the
strange
communication
from
the
girl
who
knew
and
the
detective
was
even
more
highly
elated
great
he
exclaimed
perfectly
remarkable
where
s
granniss
gone
to
boston
to
see
a
moving
picture
concern
he
may
have
to
go
on
to
new
york
he
hopes
to
be
back
by
saturday
at
it
was
minna
who
answered
and
her
face
was
jubilant
at
the
hope
renewed
in
her
heart
by
wise
s
own
hopefulness
but
she
determined
in
her
secret
thoughts
to
throw
the
money
over
the
cliff
on
friday
night
whether
the
detective
agreed
to
that
plan
or
not
what
she
argued
to
mrs
fletcher
whom
she
took
into
her
confidence
on
this
matter
was
any
amount
of
money
compared
to
the
mere
chance
of
getting
back
her
child
she
urged
and
bribed
fletcher
until
she
consented
to
help
minna
get
out
of
the
house
on
friday
night
without
wise
s
knowledge
it
was
now
tuesday
and
after
much
questioning
of
every
one
in
the
house
as
to
what
had
taken
place
in
his
absence
the
detective
shut
himself
alone
in
the
library
and
surrounded
by
his
own
written
notes
and
with
many
of
mr
varian
s
letters
and
financial
papers
he
thought
and
brooded
over
it
all
for
some
hours
at
last
he
opened
the
door
and
called
zizi
well
my
child
he
said
closing
the
door
behind
her
i
ve
got
a
line
on
i
do
hope
penny
you
ll
watch
out
for
mrs
varian
she
s
going
to
throw
the
money
over
the
cliff
on
friday
night
without
your
knowledge
or
she
can
t
do
she
can
t
without
your
knowledge
i
admit
but
she
can
without
your
consent
her
money
is
her
own
and
you
ve
no
real
authority
that
will
let
you
dictate
to
her
how
to
use
true
oh
queen
oh
penny
when
you
smile
like
that
i
know
something
s
up
what
is
it
my
luck
i
hope
ziz
do
you
remember
you
said
you
had
a
green
smear
on
your
frock
like
the
one
on
martha
s
hand
yes
why
is
it
there
yet
or
did
you
clean
it
off
it
s
there
yet
i
haven
t
worn
the
dress
get
it
will
you
zizi
went
and
returned
with
the
little
frock
a
mere
wisp
of
light
thin
material
and
handed
it
to
pennington
wise
he
inspected
the
green
streak
which
was
visible
though
not
conspicuous
and
then
he
sniffed
at
it
with
such
absorption
that
zizi
laughed
outright
pen
she
said
in
detective
stories
they
always
represent
the
great
detective
as
sniffing
like
a
hound
on
a
scent
you
re
literally
doing
not
astonishing
that
i
should
little
one
when
you
realize
that
this
green
smear
is
a
beacon
to
light
our
what
is
it
zizi
s
big
hack
eyes
grew
serious
at
wise
s
tone
the
way
out
the
exit
the
solution
of
the
mystery
of
the
secret
oh
penny
tell
me
you
ll
be
the
death
of
me
if
you
keep
the
truth
from
me
i
m
crazy
with
suspense
but
zizi
s
curiosity
could
not
be
gratified
just
then
for
fletcher
came
to
say
that
minna
desired
the
girl
s
company
minna
varian
had
come
to
depend
much
on
zizi
s
charm
and
entertainment
and
often
sent
for
her
when
feeling
especially
blue
or
nervous
zizi
had
been
waiting
for
an
opportunity
and
now
as
the
nurse
left
her
alone
with
mrs
varian
she
gradually
and
deftly
led
the
talk
around
to
betty
as
a
baby
tell
me
what
you
thought
when
you
first
saw
your
little
daughter
zizi
said
in
her
pretty
coaxing
way
how
old
was
she
about
an
hour
or
so
i
think
minna
said
reminiscently
and
my
first
thought
was
oh
thank
god
for
a
healthy
beautiful
baby
she
was
so
lovely
so
strong
and
perfect
i
had
hoped
she
would
be
all
right
but
i
never
looked
for
such
a
marvel
as
came
to
me
and
mr
varian
was
as
pleased
as
you
were
zizi
said
gently
oh
yes
minna
s
face
clouded
a
little
i
don
t
know
how
to
express
it
he
never
seemed
to
love
betty
as
he
did
our
first
children
he
admired
her
could
help
it
he
had
a
queer
little
air
of
restraint
about
her
it
lasted
all
through
life
i
can
t
understand
it
he
was
jealous
yes
of
my
love
and
adoration
of
the
child
silly
idea
i
know
but
i
ve
racked
my
brain
and
i
can
t
think
of
any
other
that
doesn
t
explain
the
varian
no
nothing
can
explain
that
oh
nothing
explains
anything
zizi
you
ve
no
idea
what
i
suffer
i
wonder
i
keep
my
mind
just
think
of
a
woman
who
never
had
to
decide
a
question
for
herself
if
she
didn
t
want
to
never
had
a
care
or
responsibility
that
she
didn
t
assume
of
her
own
accord
had
a
husband
to
care
for
her
a
daughter
to
love
the
poor
woman
broke
down
completely
and
zizi
had
her
hands
full
to
ward
off
the
violent
hysterics
that
attacked
her
at
times
meantime
pennington
wise
convinced
of
the
origin
of
the
green
smear
on
zizi
s
frock
was
starting
forth
to
prove
his
conviction
armed
only
with
a
powerful
flashlight
and
a
hammer
he
went
out
to
the
kitchen
and
through
that
to
the
cellar
there
he
went
straight
to
the
old
well
and
testing
the
rope
as
he
did
so
he
let
the
bucket
down
as
far
as
it
would
go
then
with
agility
he
began
to
clamber
down
supported
by
clinging
to
the
rope
partly
by
getting
firm
footholds
on
the
old
stones
that
lined
the
well
scarcely
had
he
started
when
he
experimentally
drew
his
hand
across
the
stones
and
by
his
flashlight
perceived
a
green
smear
the
counterpart
of
that
on
zizi
s
frock
also
the
counterpart
of
that
on
martha
s
hand
yet
the
dead
girl
could
scarcely
have
been
in
the
well
so
assailant
must
have
been
however
he
went
on
investigating
he
noted
carefully
the
walls
as
he
descended
and
it
was
not
until
he
almost
reached
the
bottom
of
the
old
well
that
he
noticed
anything
strange
all
of
the
wall
was
very
rough
and
uneven
but
here
was
what
appeared
to
be
a
distinct
hole
roughly
filled
in
with
loose
stones
standing
now
on
the
bottom
of
the
well
slippery
with
moisture
but
no
water
above
his
shoe
soles
he
used
his
hammer
to
dislodge
these
stones
working
carefully
and
slowly
but
with
a
certainty
of
success
fool
that
i
was
he
chattered
to
himself
not
to
come
down
here
the
very
first
thing
to
trust
to
zizi
was
all
right
kid
couldn
t
notice
this
place
i
had
no
business
to
trust
that
sheriff
or
his
man
his
work
soon
disclosed
the
fact
that
the
loose
stones
apparently
closed
the
mouth
of
a
deep
hole
when
all
that
were
loose
had
been
either
pulled
out
or
pushed
in
he
found
there
was
an
aperture
large
enough
to
permit
a
man
s
body
to
pass
through
and
without
hesitation
he
scrambled
through
it
his
flashlight
showed
him
that
almost
from
the
start
the
hole
widened
until
it
became
a
tunnel
crawling
along
this
for
a
hundred
yards
or
so
he
heard
the
splash
of
water
and
soon
he
no
longer
needed
his
flashlight
as
daylight
streamed
in
through
a
narrow
fissure
in
the
rock
it
was
fortunate
for
wise
that
it
did
for
just
ahead
the
tunnel
descended
sharply
and
at
the
bottom
what
was
evidently
the
surf
was
surging
in
from
the
ocean
it
was
quite
dark
below
and
being
unable
to
progress
further
wise
backed
out
of
the
tunnel
it
wasn
t
wide
enough
to
turn
around
in
and
reaching
the
well
again
he
ascended
to
the
surface
he
went
to
his
room
looked
with
satisfaction
on
the
numerous
smears
of
green
and
brown
that
disfigured
his
suit
he
had
taken
care
should
be
an
old
one
no
one
knew
what
he
had
done
nor
did
any
one
know
his
destination
when
half
an
hour
later
he
set
off
for
the
village
he
went
to
the
inn
and
inquired
where
he
could
get
the
best
motor
boat
that
could
be
hired
a
suitable
one
was
found
and
its
owner
agreed
to
take
wise
on
an
exploring
expedition
at
the
next
low
tide
this
would
not
be
until
the
following
morning
so
the
detective
went
back
to
headland
house
then
he
concentrated
all
his
efforts
and
attention
on
the
subject
of
the
moving
picture
film
that
had
been
said
to
portray
betty
varian
rod
granniss
vows
it
was
really
betty
zizi
insisted
he
ought
to
know
said
wise
a
man
in
love
with
a
girl
doesn
t
mistake
her
identity
besides
it
s
quite
on
the
cards
ziz
say
betty
is
confined
somewhere
she
is
let
out
for
a
little
exercise
in
care
of
a
jailer
of
course
there
s
a
contraption
taking
a
picture
of
a
crowd
often
do
up
stray
you
know
and
say
betty
somehow
got
into
the
oh
the
jailer
as
you
call
him
wouldn
t
let
her
more
likely
a
woman
in
charge
of
her
and
maybe
a
woman
not
averse
to
taking
the
few
dollars
those
people
pay
to
actors
who
just
make
up
a
crowd
well
say
that
happened
and
then
betty
not
daring
to
speak
aloud
made
her
lips
form
the
words
i
am
betty
varian
in
the
hope
that
among
a
few
thousands
of
lip
readers
in
the
country
one
might
strike
twelve
nobody
could
be
so
clever
as
all
that
pen
she
might
be
on
a
chance
inspiration
anyway
how
else
can
you
explain
it
why
anybody
might
have
said
that
who
wasn
t
betty
at
but
why
what
would
be
the
sense
of
it
and
why
would
such
a
thing
occur
to
anybody
but
betty
if
it
s
true
you
can
find
her
surely
you
can
track
down
a
moving
picture
company
oh
it
isn
t
that
it
s
tracking
down
the
place
where
betty
is
confined
it
while
she
is
still
alive
you
see
zizi
those
ransom
letters
are
true
bills
and
the
villains
have
nearly
reached
the
end
of
their
then
why
don
t
you
approve
of
mrs
varian
s
throwing
the
money
over
the
cliff
i
may
advise
her
to
do
it
by
friday
night
nothing
happens
in
the
but
look
here
penny
zizi
said
after
a
thoughtful
moment
if
your
theory
is
the
right
one
why
didn
t
betty
scream
out
i
am
betty
varian
and
take
a
chance
that
somebody
in
the
crowd
would
rescue
her
it
would
seem
a
natural
thing
to
do
unless
the
girl
had
been
so
cowed
by
threats
of
punishment
or
even
torture
if
she
made
any
outcry
when
allowed
to
go
for
a
walk
i
m
visualizing
that
girl
as
kept
in
close
confinement
but
not
in
any
want
or
discomfort
she
is
most
likely
treated
well
as
to
food
rooms
and
all
that
but
is
not
allowed
to
step
out
of
doors
except
with
a
strict
guard
and
under
some
terrible
penalty
if
she
attempts
to
make
herself
known
with
betty
s
love
of
fresh
air
and
sunshine
she
would
agree
to
almost
anything
to
get
out
of
doors
then
too
if
she
merely
formed
those
words
without
sound
the
chance
of
their
being
read
by
a
lip
reader
was
really
greater
than
the
chance
of
doing
any
good
by
crying
out
aloud
had
she
done
that
whoever
had
her
in
charge
would
have
whisked
her
away
at
once
and
no
one
would
have
paid
any
attention
to
the
slight
it
s
all
perfectly
logical
and
oh
i
hope
rodney
gets
some
clue
to
the
place
where
the
picture
was
i
hope
so
ziz
but
they
ve
probably
moved
betty
away
from
there
by
did
you
find
out
penny
what
that
stain
on
my
frock
was
i
well
yes
my
dear
you
ve
struck
it
you
got
that
stain
while
you
were
down
the
oh
zizi
s
eyes
lighted
up
of
course
i
did
those
damp
mossy
stones
and
then
oh
wise
one
just
how
did
the
same
stain
get
on
martha
s
hand
that
zizi
wise
spoke
almost
solemnly
is
part
of
the
solution
of
the
whole
great
chapter
xviii
the
trap
in
a
small
but
powerful
motor
boat
wise
went
on
his
voyage
of
exploration
the
man
who
managed
the
craft
was
a
stolid
silent
person
who
obeyed
wise
s
orders
without
comment
but
when
the
detective
directed
that
he
go
round
the
base
of
the
headland
and
skirt
close
to
the
rocks
he
grumbled
at
the
danger
be
careful
of
the
danger
wise
said
steer
clear
of
hidden
reefs
but
go
close
to
the
overhanging
cliff
there
where
i
m
skirting
the
cliff
at
last
wise
discovered
what
he
was
looking
for
a
small
cave
worn
in
the
rock
by
the
sea
the
floor
of
this
cave
rose
sharply
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
wise
managed
to
scramble
from
the
boat
to
a
secure
footing
on
the
slippery
wet
rocks
look
out
there
said
the
imperturbable
boatman
you
ll
get
caught
in
there
when
the
tide
comes
up
i
never
noticed
that
hole
in
the
wall
before
it
must
be
out
o
sight
ceptin
at
low
stay
where
you
are
and
wait
for
me
wise
directed
if
i
m
not
out
here
again
in
half
an
hour
go
on
home
but
i
ll
probably
be
back
in
less
than
you
will
if
you
re
back
at
all
the
tide
will
turn
in
fifteen
minutes
and
in
half
an
hour
it
ll
be
all
you
can
do
to
get
out
disappearing
wise
began
his
climb
up
the
floor
of
the
cave
and
at
a
point
just
above
high
water
there
was
a
fissure
in
the
cliff
which
admitted
air
and
some
light
at
this
point
the
cave
ran
back
for
some
distance
though
still
on
a
rising
level
during
the
winter
storms
the
ocean
evidently
had
worn
this
tunnel
in
the
rock
wise
at
once
realized
that
this
tunnel
ran
on
for
some
distance
until
it
ended
in
the
old
well
using
his
flashlight
when
necessary
he
made
his
way
until
he
reached
the
pile
of
stones
which
he
himself
had
pushed
out
from
the
well
and
found
to
his
satisfaction
that
he
had
indeed
come
to
the
well
and
that
his
solution
of
the
mystery
of
a
secret
passage
into
headland
house
was
accomplished
but
what
a
solution
the
difficulty
and
danger
of
entrance
or
exit
by
means
of
that
rock
tunnel
and
that
old
well
could
scarce
be
exaggerated
moreover
all
such
entrances
or
exits
must
be
made
at
the
lowest
ebb
of
the
tide
but
the
cave
was
roomy
not
uncomfortable
and
the
tunnel
though
cramped
in
places
was
fairly
navigable
there
was
plenty
of
room
in
the
cave
quite
above
reach
of
the
highest
tide
and
the
whole
matter
was
clear
and
simple
now
that
he
saw
it
all
but
he
marveled
at
the
energy
and
enterprise
that
could
conceive
plan
and
carry
out
the
various
attacks
whoever
the
criminal
or
the
master
criminal
might
be
he
had
come
up
through
that
tunnel
and
well
on
the
several
occasions
of
the
kidnapping
of
betty
the
murder
of
martha
the
abduction
of
north
wise
remembered
the
letter
that
had
been
mysteriously
left
on
the
hall
table
the
night
the
library
had
been
entered
the
man
came
and
went
at
will
a
master
mind
wise
concluded
he
had
to
deal
with
and
he
set
his
own
best
energies
to
work
on
his
problems
the
way
between
headland
house
and
the
outer
world
was
not
easy
of
negotiation
but
it
was
a
way
and
it
was
passable
to
a
determined
human
being
wise
was
back
inside
the
prescribed
half
hour
and
the
uninterested
boatman
took
him
back
to
the
harbor
without
question
or
comment
as
to
his
enterprise
that
afternoon
wise
called
minna
and
doctor
varian
into
the
library
and
closed
the
door
zizi
was
also
present
her
black
eyes
shining
with
anticipation
for
she
knew
from
wise
s
manner
and
expression
that
he
was
making
progress
and
was
about
to
disclose
his
discoveries
i
have
learned
a
great
deal
the
detective
began
but
not
all
at
least
i
have
found
the
secret
passage
which
we
all
felt
sure
must
he
described
the
cave
and
the
tunnel
as
he
had
found
them
and
the
outlet
into
the
old
well
so
carefully
piled
with
loose
stones
that
it
would
escape
the
observance
of
almost
any
searcher
he
told
briefly
but
graphically
of
his
exit
from
the
well
for
a
distance
and
of
his
later
entrance
from
the
cave
and
his
procedure
to
the
well
zizi
nodded
her
little
head
with
an
air
of
complete
understanding
doctor
varian
was
absorbedly
interested
and
profoundly
amazed
while
minna
looked
helplessly
ignorant
of
just
what
wise
was
talking
about
i
can
t
understand
it
she
said
piteously
but
never
mind
that
i
don
t
care
if
you
say
it
s
all
so
now
where
is
betty
that
we
don
t
know
yet
wise
said
gently
but
we
are
on
the
way
at
last
to
find
out
as
i
reconstruct
the
crime
now
that
day
that
betty
returned
for
her
camera
she
must
have
done
so
under
one
of
two
conditions
either
her
errand
was
genuine
in
which
case
she
surprised
the
criminal
here
at
some
nefarious
work
which
i
think
far
more
probable
she
came
back
pretending
it
was
for
her
camera
but
really
because
of
some
message
or
communication
which
she
had
received
purporting
some
good
to
her
but
really
a
ruse
of
the
criminal
who
was
here
for
the
purpose
of
abducting
the
for
ransom
asked
doctor
varian
yes
for
ransom
now
he
would
naturally
attack
her
in
the
hall
perhaps
she
threw
herself
on
the
sofa
clung
to
it
and
was
carried
off
still
holding
that
yellow
pillow
either
unconsciously
or
he
may
have
used
it
to
stifle
her
cries
there
were
two
men
involved
of
that
i
am
sure
for
when
they
had
partly
accomplished
their
purpose
mr
varian
appeared
at
the
door
and
one
of
the
men
had
to
intercept
his
entrance
i
rather
fancy
the
killing
of
mr
varian
was
unintentional
possibly
for
these
ruffians
did
not
want
to
kill
their
blackmail
victim
they
may
have
parleyed
with
the
father
to
pay
them
to
release
the
girl
and
when
he
showed
fight
as
he
would
they
did
also
and
as
a
result
mr
varian
met
his
death
however
that
is
mere
surmise
what
we
know
is
that
betty
was
carried
through
the
kitchen
where
the
pillow
fell
holding
one
of
her
probably
caught
during
the
struggle
she
was
carried
down
the
cellar
stairs
during
this
trip
her
string
of
beads
broke
and
were
scattered
about
as
we
never
found
but
a
few
and
those
were
under
furniture
or
cupboards
i
gather
the
villains
picked
up
all
they
could
see
lest
they
should
be
found
as
which
they
were
said
zizi
which
they
were
wise
assented
then
they
carried
that
girl
whether
conscious
or
chloroformed
i
can
t
say
down
to
the
cellar
down
the
old
well
through
the
tunnel
to
the
cave
there
they
could
wait
any
number
of
hours
until
the
tide
served
and
take
her
away
in
a
boat
without
attracting
the
notice
of
most
likely
at
night
zizi
put
in
most
likely
anyway
mrs
varian
that
s
my
finding
it
s
all
very
dreadful
but
horrifying
as
it
is
it
opens
the
way
to
better
things
to
go
on
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
same
villain
and
a
clever
one
he
is
returned
here
at
night
for
plunder
and
on
other
errands
he
came
and
left
the
letter
found
so
mysteriously
on
the
hall
table
he
came
to
rob
the
library
safe
thinking
the
ransom
money
was
in
it
and
he
was
spied
upon
and
discovered
by
the
maid
martha
so
that
he
ruthlessly
strangled
the
poor
thing
to
death
rather
than
face
and
then
he
abducted
north
doctor
varian
cried
and
it
s
easy
to
see
why
north
had
doubtless
also
spied
on
him
and
somehow
he
forced
north
to
go
away
with
him
at
pistol
s
now
our
question
is
two
questions
zizi
cried
first
who
is
the
criminal
second
where
is
he
keeping
betty
all
this
time
yes
and
we
know
a
great
deal
to
start
wise
spoke
thoughtfully
we
know
almost
to
a
certainty
that
it
is
the
man
whom
we
call
stephen
because
he
wrote
threatening
letters
signed
we
know
he
is
diabolically
clever
absolutely
fearless
and
willing
to
commit
any
crime
or
series
of
crimes
to
gain
his
end
which
is
merely
the
large
sum
of
money
he
has
demanded
from
mrs
varian
and
which
he
had
previously
demanded
from
mr
varian
as
why
should
he
blackmail
my
husband
minna
asked
tearfully
and
wise
said
there
is
not
always
a
sound
reason
for
blackmail
mrs
varian
sometimes
it
is
an
unjust
accusation
or
a
mistaken
suspicion
any
way
as
you
have
often
declared
mr
frederick
varian
was
a
noble
and
upright
man
and
his
integrity
could
not
be
now
then
said
doctor
varian
to
find
this
master
hand
at
crime
i
am
astounded
at
your
revelations
mr
wise
and
i
confess
myself
utterly
in
the
dark
as
to
our
next
an
animal
that
attacks
in
the
open
wise
returned
may
be
shot
or
snared
but
a
wicked
crafty
animal
may
only
be
caught
by
a
trap
i
propose
to
set
a
trap
to
catch
our
foe
it
is
a
wicked
trap
but
he
is
a
wicked
man
it
will
harm
him
physically
but
he
deserves
to
be
harmed
physically
it
is
a
sly
underhand
method
but
so
are
his
own
therefore
i
conclude
that
a
trap
is
justified
in
his
you
mean
a
real
literal
mantrap
asked
the
doctor
i
mean
just
that
i
have
already
procured
it
and
i
propose
to
set
it
tonight
this
is
thursday
as
matters
stand
now
our
stephen
is
assuming
or
at
least
hoping
that
mrs
varian
means
to
accede
to
his
last
request
and
throw
the
money
over
the
cliff
tomorrow
friday
night
now
i
feel
pretty
positive
that
stephen
is
not
so
confident
of
getting
that
money
safely
as
he
pretends
he
is
he
must
be
more
or
less
fearful
of
detection
i
m
sure
that
he
will
return
to
this
house
tonight
by
his
usual
mode
of
entrance
and
will
try
to
steal
the
money
then
he
will
disappear
and
he
may
or
may
not
give
up
you
think
he
ll
come
here
tonight
doctor
varian
was
astonished
i
then
we
ll
be
ready
for
him
i
fancy
between
us
mr
wise
we
can
account
for
him
and
his
too
dangerous
doctor
he
would
kill
us
both
before
we
knew
it
no
i
m
going
to
set
my
trap
if
he
comes
he
deserves
to
be
trapped
if
he
doesn
t
come
there
is
certainly
no
harm
where
shall
we
hide
the
money
asked
minna
nervously
it
doesn
t
matter
and
wise
s
face
set
sternly
he
will
never
get
as
far
as
the
hating
his
job
but
fully
alive
to
the
justice
and
necessity
of
it
wise
set
his
trap
that
night
it
was
a
real
trap
and
was
set
up
in
the
kitchen
in
such
a
position
that
it
faced
the
cellar
door
it
consisted
of
a
shotgun
which
was
mounted
on
an
improvised
gun
carriage
made
of
a
strong
packing
box
this
contrivance
was
fastened
carefully
to
the
kitchen
wall
about
twelve
feet
in
front
of
the
cellar
door
and
when
the
door
should
be
opened
the
trap
would
be
sprung
and
the
shotgun
discharged
a
steel
spring
fastened
to
the
trigger
and
a
strong
cord
running
to
a
pulley
in
the
ceiling
thence
to
another
and
finally
to
a
pulley
in
the
floor
and
on
to
the
door
knob
completed
the
deadly
mechanism
the
tension
of
the
spring
was
so
carefully
adjusted
that
an
intruder
might
open
the
door
a
foot
or
more
before
the
strain
was
carried
to
the
trigger
this
insured
a
sure
aim
and
a
clear
shot
wise
tested
his
trap
thoroughly
and
finally
with
a
grim
nod
of
his
head
declared
it
was
all
right
he
had
sent
the
servants
and
the
to
bed
before
beginning
his
work
and
now
he
and
doctor
varian
seated
themselves
in
the
library
to
await
developments
as
i
said
wise
remarked
stephen
may
not
come
at
all
he
may
send
an
accomplice
yet
this
i
expect
the
most
surely
will
come
have
you
no
idea
of
his
identity
mr
wise
the
doctor
asked
yes
i
have
an
idea
if
he
does
not
come
tonight
i
will
tell
you
who
i
think
he
is
but
we
will
wait
and
they
waited
now
silent
and
now
indulging
in
a
few
low
toned
bits
of
conversation
when
at
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
report
of
the
gun
brought
them
to
their
feet
and
they
raced
to
the
kitchen
the
roaring
detonation
was
still
in
their
ears
as
they
strode
through
the
hall
and
the
smell
of
powder
greeted
them
at
the
kitchen
door
the
cellar
door
was
open
and
on
the
floor
near
it
lay
a
man
breathing
with
difficulty
doctor
varian
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
him
and
his
professional
instinct
was
at
once
in
full
working
order
even
as
his
astonished
voice
exclaimed
lawrence
north
as
i
expected
wise
said
and
well
he
deserves
his
fate
will
he
live
doctor
only
a
few
moments
was
the
preoccupied
reply
i
can
do
nothing
for
him
he
received
the
full
charge
in
the
tell
your
story
north
wise
said
briefly
don
t
waste
time
in
useless
north
glared
at
the
detective
you
fiend
he
gasped
gurgling
in
rage
and
agony
you
re
the
fiend
varian
said
hush
your
vituperation
and
tell
us
where
betty
a
smile
of
low
cunning
came
over
north
s
villainous
face
he
used
his
small
remaining
strength
to
say
that
you
ll
never
know
you
ve
spiked
your
own
guns
nobody
knows
but
me
i
won
t
tell
alarmed
wise
tried
another
tone
this
won
t
do
north
he
said
whatever
your
crime
you
can
t
refuse
that
last
act
of
expiation
tell
where
she
is
and
die
the
better
for
no
gasped
the
dying
man
bad
i
ve
lived
and
bad
i
ll
die
you
ll
never
find
betty
varian
there
are
standing
orders
to
do
away
with
her
if
anything
happens
to
me
and
tried
to
smile
something
has
happened
it
sure
has
wise
said
and
looked
at
him
with
real
pity
for
the
man
was
suffering
tortures
but
i
command
you
north
by
the
blood
you
have
shed
by
the
two
human
lives
you
have
taken
by
the
heart
of
the
wife
and
mother
that
you
have
broken
charge
you
give
up
your
secret
while
you
have
strength
to
do
so
for
a
moment
north
seemed
to
hesitate
a
little
stimulant
administered
by
the
doctor
gave
him
a
trifle
more
strength
but
then
his
face
changed
turned
reminiscent
good
work
he
said
it
seemed
exultingly
when
i
first
found
the
cave
a
year
ago
i
began
to
plan
how
i
could
get
the
varians
to
take
this
house
they
little
thought
i
brought
it
about
through
the
real
estate
never
mind
all
that
wise
urged
him
where
s
betty
betty
ah
yes
his
mind
seemed
to
wander
again
and
varian
gave
him
a
few
drops
more
stimulant
get
it
out
of
him
he
said
to
the
detective
this
will
lose
all
efficacy
in
another
few
moments
he
is
going
am
i
and
north
was
momentarily
alert
all
right
doc
i
ll
go
and
my
secret
will
go
with
where
is
betty
wise
leaned
over
the
miserable
wretch
as
if
he
would
drag
the
secret
from
him
by
sheer
will
power
but
the
other
s
will
power
matched
his
own
betty
he
said
oh
yes
betty
really
my
wife
s
daughter
you
know
had
a
right
to
her
didn
t
step
wise
cried
step
that
you
signed
to
those
letters
was
short
for
stepfather
yes
of
course
my
wife
didn
t
mean
to
tell
me
that
story
t
know
she
did
babbled
in
her
sleep
and
i
got
it
out
of
her
by
various
hints
and
allusions
mrs
varian
never
knew
so
i
bled
the
old
man
my
he
was
in
a
blue
funk
whenever
i
attacked
him
about
it
where
is
she
now
wise
hinted
no
sir
you
don
t
get
it
out
of
me
you
caught
me
you
now
i
ll
make
you
wish
you
hadn
t
and
lawrence
north
died
without
another
word
baffled
and
spent
with
his
exhausting
efforts
wise
left
the
dead
man
in
the
doctor
s
care
and
returned
to
the
library
he
found
zizi
there
she
had
listened
from
the
hall
and
had
overheard
much
that
went
on
but
she
couldn
t
bring
herself
to
go
where
the
wounded
man
lay
oh
penny
she
sobbed
he
didn
t
tell
maybe
if
i
had
gone
in
i
could
have
got
it
out
of
him
but
i
t
look
at
never
mind
dear
that
s
all
right
he
wouldn
t
have
told
you
either
the
man
is
the
worst
criminal
i
have
ever
known
he
has
no
drop
of
humanity
in
his
veins
as
to
remorse
or
regret
he
never
knew
their
meaning
now
what
shall
we
do
is
mrs
varian
awake
yes
in
mild
hysterics
fletcher
is
with
doctor
varian
must
go
to
her
and
after
that
doubtless
you
can
soothe
her
better
than
any
one
else
i
ll
get
potter
and
dunn
up
here
i
fervently
hope
it
s
for
the
last
time
penny
your
work
was
wonderful
you
were
right
a
thing
like
that
had
to
be
trapped
caught
openly
you
re
a
wonder
yet
it
all
failed
when
i
failed
to
learn
where
betty
is
i
shall
find
her
i
fear
zizi
i
fear
that
the
evil
that
man
has
done
will
live
after
him
i
fear
for
the
fate
of
betty
zizi
tried
to
cheer
him
but
her
heart
too
was
heavy
with
vague
fears
and
she
left
him
to
his
routine
work
of
calling
the
police
and
once
again
bringing
them
up
to
headland
house
on
a
gruesome
errand
these
things
done
wise
went
at
once
to
north
s
bungalow
in
headland
harbor
he
had
small
hope
of
finding
joe
mills
there
and
as
he
had
foreseen
that
worthy
had
decamped
nor
did
they
ever
see
him
again
i
suppose
wise
said
afterward
he
was
in
the
cellar
when
north
was
killed
but
i
never
thought
of
him
then
nor
could
i
have
caught
him
as
he
doubtless
fled
away
in
the
darkness
to
then
it
was
a
put
up
job
that
scene
of
struggle
and
confusion
in
north
s
bedroom
that
day
he
disappeared
bill
dunn
asked
of
wise
yes
i
felt
it
was
but
i
couldn
t
see
how
he
got
away
you
see
at
that
time
north
began
to
feel
that
my
suspicions
were
beginning
to
turn
in
his
direction
and
he
thought
by
pretending
to
be
abducted
himself
he
would
argue
a
bold
and
wicked
kidnapper
again
at
work
at
any
rate
he
wanted
to
get
away
and
stay
away
the
better
to
carry
on
his
dreadful
purposes
and
he
chose
that
really
clever
way
of
departing
the
touch
of
leaving
his
watch
behind
was
truly
artistic
he
forgot
it
well
now
to
find
betty
just
a
minute
mr
wise
how
d
you
come
to
think
of
looking
for
that
cave
arrangement
after
i
began
to
suspect
north
i
watched
him
very
closely
i
had
in
my
mind
some
sort
of
rock
passage
and
when
i
took
him
out
in
a
boat
or
joe
mills
either
when
we
went
close
to
that
part
of
the
rocks
where
the
cave
is
i
noted
their
evident
efforts
to
look
toward
a
certain
spot
it
was
almost
amusing
to
see
how
their
eyes
strayed
that
way
and
were
quickly
averted
they
almost
told
me
just
where
to
look
wonderful
work
dunn
exclaimed
heartily
no
wise
returned
only
a
bit
of
psychology
now
to
find
but
though
the
detective
doubtless
would
have
recovered
the
missing
girl
he
had
not
the
opportunity
for
love
had
found
a
way
by
the
hardest
sort
of
work
and
with
indefatigable
perseverance
granniss
had
gone
from
one
to
another
of
the
various
officials
mechanicians
and
even
workmen
of
the
moving
picture
company
he
was
on
the
trail
of
and
after
maddening
delays
caused
by
their
lack
of
method
their
careless
records
and
their
uncertain
memories
he
finally
found
out
where
the
picture
of
a
crowd
in
which
betty
had
appeared
was
taken
and
then
by
further
and
unwearying
search
he
found
an
old
but
strongly
built
and
well
guarded
house
where
he
had
reason
to
think
betty
was
imprisoned
finding
this
he
didn
t
wait
for
proofs
of
his
belief
but
telegraphed
for
pennington
wise
and
sheriff
potter
to
come
there
at
once
and
gain
entrance
rod
s
inexperience
led
him
to
adopt
this
course
but
it
proved
a
good
one
for
his
telegram
reached
wise
the
day
after
north
s
death
and
he
hurried
off
potter
with
him
the
house
was
in
vermont
and
while
potter
made
the
necessary
arrangements
with
the
local
authorities
wise
went
on
to
meet
granniss
there
s
the
house
and
wise
saw
the
rather
old
mansion
i
m
dead
sure
betty
s
in
there
but
i
can
t
get
entrance
though
i
ve
tried
every
possible
but
the
arrival
of
the
police
soon
effected
an
entrance
and
armed
with
the
knowledge
of
north
s
death
as
well
as
more
material
implements
they
all
went
in
pretty
betty
as
pretty
as
ever
though
pale
and
thin
from
worry
and
fear
ran
straight
into
granniss
arms
and
nestled
there
in
such
absolute
relief
and
content
that
the
other
men
present
turned
away
from
the
scene
with
a
choke
in
their
throats
if
granniss
hadn
t
found
her
the
news
of
north
s
death
brought
the
jailers
to
terms
at
once
they
were
a
man
and
wife
big
strong
people
who
were
carrying
out
north
s
orders
to
be
kind
and
proper
to
the
girl
but
not
to
let
her
get
the
moving
picture
incident
had
occurred
just
as
wise
had
surmised
on
her
daily
walks
for
exercise
betty
was
sometimes
allowed
to
get
into
a
crowd
at
the
studio
near
by
and
frequently
she
had
tried
her
clever
plan
of
silent
talk
but
only
once
had
that
plan
succeeded
yet
once
was
enough
and
granniss
said
look
here
you
people
clear
up
all
the
red
tape
won
t
you
betty
and
i
want
to
go
home
run
along
said
wise
kindly
there
s
a
train
in
an
hour
skip
god
bless
you
their
arrival
at
headland
house
heralded
by
a
telegram
to
zizi
had
no
unduly
exciting
effects
on
minna
varian
doctor
varian
watched
her
but
as
he
saw
the
radiant
joy
with
which
she
clasped
betty
in
her
arms
he
had
no
fear
of
the
shock
of
joy
proving
too
much
for
her
oh
mother
betty
cried
don
t
let
s
talk
about
it
now
i
ll
tell
you
anything
you
want
to
know
some
other
time
now
just
let
me
revel
in
being
here
nor
did
any
one
bother
the
poor
child
save
to
ask
a
few
important
questions
these
brought
the
information
that
betty
had
been
decoyed
back
to
the
house
that
day
by
a
false
message
purporting
to
be
from
granniss
asking
her
to
return
after
the
rest
left
the
house
and
call
him
up
on
the
telephone
this
betty
tried
to
do
using
her
camera
as
an
excuse
but
she
never
reached
the
telephone
once
in
the
house
she
was
grasped
and
the
assailants
there
were
two
attempted
to
chloroform
her
but
chloroforming
is
not
such
a
speedy
matter
as
many
believe
and
she
was
still
struggling
against
the
fumes
when
her
father
appeared
north
held
betty
while
the
other
man
who
was
joe
mills
fought
frederick
varian
and
in
the
struggle
shot
him
this
angered
north
so
that
he
lost
his
head
he
almost
killed
mills
in
his
rage
and
fury
and
seizing
betty
made
for
the
secret
passage
on
the
way
her
string
of
beads
broke
the
pillow
which
they
used
to
help
make
her
unconscious
was
dropped
on
the
kitchen
floor
and
then
she
was
carried
down
the
well
through
the
tunnel
and
cave
and
away
in
a
swift
motor
boat
but
in
a
half
conscious
state
all
these
things
were
like
a
dream
to
her
a
dream
which
must
not
be
recalled
said
granniss
with
an
air
of
authority
that
sat
well
upon
him
my
blessing
minna
said
fondling
the
girl
never
mind
about
anything
now
that
i
have
you
back
i
miss
your
father
more
than
words
can
say
but
with
you
restored
i
can
know
happiness
again
let
us
both
try
to
later
a
council
was
held
as
to
whether
to
tell
minna
the
true
story
of
betty
s
birth
the
two
young
people
had
to
be
told
and
doctor
varian
was
appealed
to
for
a
decision
regarding
minna
i
don
t
know
he
said
uncertainly
you
see
it
explains
the
pearls
i
ll
tell
you
granniss
said
don
t
let
s
tell
mother
varian
now
betty
and
i
will
be
married
very
soon
and
after
that
we
can
see
about
it
or
if
she
has
to
know
at
the
time
of
the
wedding
we
ll
tell
her
then
but
let
her
rejoice
in
her
new
found
child
as
her
own
child
as
long
as
she
can
surely
she
deserves
and
don
t
care
betty
asked
looking
at
him
wistfully
my
darling
i
don
t
care
whether
you
re
the
daughter
of
a
princess
or
pauperess

my
wife

granniss

hearts
said
zizi
her
black
eyes
showing
a
tender
gleam
for
the
girl
she
had
so
long
known
of
and
only
now
known
and
bless
your
sweetheart
when

one
betty
said
her
happy
heart
so
full
of
joy
that
her
old
gayety
already
began
to
return

end
