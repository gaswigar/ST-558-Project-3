the
adventures
of
ulysses
by
charles
lamb
preface
this
work
is
designed
as
a
supplement
to
the
adventures
of
telemachus
it
treats
of
the
conduct
and
sufferings
of
ulysses
the
father
of
telemachus
the
picture
which
it
exhibits
is
that
of
a
brave
man
struggling
with
adversity
by
a
wise
use
of
events
and
with
an
inimitable
presence
of
mind
under
difficulties
forcing
out
a
way
for
himself
through
the
severest
trials
to
which
human
life
can
be
exposed
with
enemies
natural
and
preternatural
surrounding
him
on
all
sides
the
agents
in
this
tale
besides
men
and
women
are
giants
enchanters
sirens
things
which
denote
external
force
or
internal
temptations
the
twofold
danger
which
a
wise
fortitude
must
expect
to
encounter
in
its
course
through
this
world
the
fictions
contained
in
it
will
be
found
to
comprehend
some
of
the
most
admired
inventions
of
grecian
mythology
the
groundwork
of
the
story
is
as
old
as
the
odyssey
but
the
moral
and
the
coloring
are
comparatively
modern
by
avoiding
the
prolixity
which
marks
the
speeches
and
the
descriptions
in
homer
i
have
gained
a
rapidity
to
the
narration
which
i
hope
will
make
it
more
attractive
and
give
it
more
the
air
of
a
romance
to
young
readers
though
i
am
sensible
that
by
the
curtailment
i
have
sacrificed
in
many
places
the
manners
to
the
passion
the
subordinate
characteristics
to
the
essential
interest
of
the
story
the
attempt
is
not
to
be
considered
as
seeking
a
comparison
with
any
of
the
direct
translations
of
the
odyssey
either
in
prose
or
verse
though
if
i
were
to
state
the
obligations
which
i
have
had
to
one
obsolete
version
footnote
the
translation
of
homer
by
chapman
in
the
reign
of
james
i
i
should
run
the
hazard
of
depriving
myself
of
the
very
slender
degree
of
reputation
which
i
could
hope
to
acquire
from
a
trifle
like
the
present

fatal
the
laestrygonian
this
history
tells
of
the
wanderings
of
ulysses
and
his
followers
in
their
return
from
troy
after
the
destruction
of
that
famous
city
of
asia
by
the
grecians
he
was
inflamed
with
a
desire
of
seeing
again
after
a
ten
years
absence
his
wife
and
native
country
ithaca
he
was
king
of
a
barren
spot
and
a
poor
country
in
comparison
of
the
fruitful
plains
of
asia
which
he
was
leaving
or
the
wealthy
kingdoms
which
he
touched
upon
in
his
return
yet
wherever
he
came
he
could
never
see
a
soil
which
appeared
in
his
eyes
half
so
sweet
or
desirable
as
his
country
earth
this
made
him
refuse
the
offers
of
the
goddess
calypso
to
stay
with
her
and
partake
of
her
immortality
in
the
delightful
island
and
this
gave
him
strength
to
break
from
the
enchantments
of
circe
the
daughter
of
the
sun
from
troy
ill
winds
cast
ulysses
and
his
fleet
upon
the
coast
of
the
cicons
a
people
hostile
to
the
grecians
landing
his
forces
he
laid
siege
to
their
chief
city
ismarus
which
he
took
and
with
it
much
spoil
and
slew
many
people
but
success
proved
fatal
to
him
for
his
soldiers
elated
with
the
spoil
and
the
good
store
of
provisions
which
they
found
in
that
place
fell
to
eating
and
drinking
forgetful
of
their
safety
till
the
cicons
who
inhabited
the
coast
had
time
to
assemble
their
friends
and
allies
from
the
interior
who
mustering
in
prodigious
force
set
upon
the
grecians
while
they
negligently
revelled
and
feasted
and
slew
many
of
them
and
recovered
the
spoil
they
dispirited
and
thinned
in
their
numbers
with
difficulty
made
their
retreat
good
to
the
ships
thence
they
set
sail
sad
at
heart
yet
something
cheered
that
with
such
fearful
odds
against
them
they
had
not
all
been
utterly
destroyed
a
dreadful
tempest
ensued
which
for
two
nights
and
two
days
tossed
them
about
but
the
third
day
the
weather
cleared
and
they
had
hopes
of
a
favourable
gale
to
carry
them
to
ithaca
but
as
they
doubled
the
cape
of
malea
suddenly
a
north
wind
arising
drove
them
back
as
far
as
cythera
after
that
for
the
space
of
nine
days
contrary
winds
continued
to
drive
them
in
an
opposite
direction
to
the
point
to
which
they
were
bound
and
the
tenth
day
they
put
in
at
a
shore
where
a
race
of
men
dwell
that
are
sustained
by
the
fruit
of
the
here
ulysses
sent
some
of
his
men
to
land
for
fresh
water
who
were
met
by
certain
of
the
inhabitants
that
gave
them
some
of
their
country
food
to
eat
not
with
any
ill
intention
towards
them
though
in
the
event
it
proved
pernicious
for
having
eaten
of
this
fruit
so
pleasant
it
proved
to
their
appetite
that
they
in
a
minute
quite
forgot
all
thoughts
of
home
or
of
their
countrymen
or
of
ever
returning
back
to
the
ships
to
give
an
account
of
what
sort
of
inhabitants
dwelt
there
but
they
would
needs
stay
and
live
there
among
them
and
eat
of
that
precious
food
forever
and
when
ulysses
sent
other
of
his
men
to
look
for
them
and
to
bring
them
back
by
force
they
strove
and
wept
and
would
not
leave
their
food
for
heaven
itself
so
much
the
pleasure
of
that
enchanting
fruit
had
bewitched
them
but
ulysses
caused
them
to
be
bound
hand
and
foot
and
cast
under
the
hatches
and
set
sail
with
all
possible
speed
from
that
baneful
coast
lest
others
after
them
might
taste
the
lotos
which
had
such
strange
qualities
to
make
men
forget
their
native
country
and
the
thoughts
of
home
coasting
on
all
that
night
by
unknown
and
shores
they
came
by
daybreak
to
the
land
where
the
cyclops
dwell
a
sort
of
giant
shepherds
that
neither
sow
nor
plough
but
the
earth
untilled
produces
for
them
rich
wheat
and
barley
and
grapes
yet
they
have
neither
bread
nor
wine
nor
know
the
arts
of
cultivation
nor
care
to
know
them
for
they
live
each
man
to
himself
without
law
or
government
or
anything
like
a
state
or
kingdom
but
their
dwellings
are
in
caves
on
the
steep
heads
of
mountains
every
man
household
governed
by
his
own
caprice
or
not
governed
at
all
their
wives
and
children
as
lawless
as
themselves
none
caring
for
others
but
each
doing
as
he
or
she
thinks
good
ships
or
boats
they
have
none
nor
artificers
to
make
them
no
trade
or
commerce
or
wish
to
visit
other
shores
yet
they
have
convenient
places
for
harbours
and
for
shipping
here
ulysses
with
a
chosen
party
of
twelve
followers
landed
to
explore
what
sort
of
men
dwelt
there
whether
hospitable
and
friendly
to
strangers
or
altogether
wild
and
savage
for
as
yet
no
dwellers
appeared
in
sight
the
first
sign
of
habitation
which
they
came
to
was
a
giant
cave
rudely
fashioned
but
of
a
size
which
betokened
the
vast
proportions
of
its
owner
the
pillars
which
supported
it
being
the
bodies
of
huge
oaks
or
pines
in
the
natural
state
of
the
tree
and
all
about
showed
more
marks
of
strength
than
skill
in
whoever
built
it
ulysses
entering
it
admired
the
savage
contrivances
and
artless
structure
of
the
place
and
longed
to
see
the
tenant
of
so
outlandish
a
mansion
but
well
conjecturing
that
gifts
would
have
more
avail
in
extracting
courtesy
than
strength
would
succeed
in
forcing
it
from
such
a
one
as
he
expected
to
find
the
inhabitant
he
resolved
to
flatter
his
hospitality
with
a
present
of
greek
wine
of
which
he
had
store
in
twelve
great
vessels
so
strong
that
no
one
ever
drank
it
without
an
infusion
of
twenty
parts
of
water
to
one
of
wine
yet
the
fragrance
of
it
even
then
so
delicious
that
it
would
have
vexed
a
man
who
smelled
it
to
abstain
from
tasting
it
but
whoever
tasted
it
it
was
able
to
raise
his
courage
to
the
height
of
heroic
deeds
taking
with
them
a
flagon
full
of
this
precious
liquor
they
ventured
into
the
recesses
of
the
cave
here
they
pleased
themselves
a
whole
day
with
beholding
the
giant
kitchen
where
the
flesh
of
sheep
and
goats
lay
strewed
his
dairy
where
stood
ranged
in
troughs
and
pails
his
pens
where
he
kept
his
live
animals
but
those
he
had
driven
forth
to
pasture
with
him
when
he
went
out
in
the
morning
while
they
were
feasting
their
eyes
with
a
sight
of
these
curiosities
their
ears
were
suddenly
deafened
with
a
noise
like
the
falling
of
a
house
it
was
the
owner
of
the
cave
who
had
been
abroad
all
day
feeding
his
flock
as
his
custom
was
in
the
mountains
and
now
drove
them
home
in
the
evening
from
pasture
he
threw
down
a
pile
of
which
he
had
been
gathering
against
before
the
mouth
of
the
cave
which
occasioned
the
crash
they
heard
the
grecians
hid
themselves
in
the
remote
parts
of
the
cave
at
sight
of
the
uncouth
monster
it
was
polyphemus
the
largest
and
savagest
of
the
cyclops
who
boasted
himself
to
be
the
son
of
neptune
he
looked
more
like
a
mountain
crag
than
a
man
and
to
his
brutal
body
he
had
a
brutish
mind
answerable
he
drove
his
flock
all
that
gave
milk
to
the
interior
of
the
cave
but
left
the
rams
and
the
without
then
taking
up
a
stone
so
massy
that
twenty
oxen
could
not
have
drawn
it
he
placed
it
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
to
defend
the
entrance
and
sat
him
down
to
milk
his
ewes
and
his
goats
which
done
he
lastly
kindled
a
fire
and
throwing
his
great
eye
round
the
cave
for
the
cyclops
have
no
more
than
one
eye
and
that
placed
in
the
midst
of
their
forehead
by
the
glimmering
light
he
discerned
some
of
ulysses
men
ho
guests
what
are
you
merchants
or
wandering
thieves
he
bellowed
out
in
a
voice
which
took
from
them
all
power
of
reply
it
was
so
astounding
only
ulysses
summoned
resolution
to
answer
that
they
came
neither
for
plunder
nor
traffic
but
were
grecians
who
had
lost
their
way
returning
from
troy
which
famous
city
under
the
conduct
of
agamemnon
the
renowned
son
of
atreus
they
had
sacked
and
laid
level
with
the
ground
yet
now
they
prostrated
themselves
humbly
before
his
feet
whom
they
acknowledged
to
be
mightier
than
they
and
besought
him
that
he
would
bestow
the
rites
of
hospitality
upon
them
for
that
jove
was
the
avenger
of
wrongs
done
to
strangers
and
would
fiercely
resent
any
injury
which
they
might
suffer
fool
said
the
cyclop
to
come
so
far
to
preach
to
me
the
fear
of
the
gods
we
cyclops
care
not
for
your
jove
whom
you
fable
to
be
nursed
by
a
goat
nor
any
of
your
blessed
ones
we
are
stronger
than
they
and
dare
bid
open
battle
to
jove
himself
though
you
and
all
your
fellows
of
the
earth
join
with
him
and
he
bade
them
tell
him
where
their
ship
was
in
which
they
came
and
whether
they
had
any
companions
but
ulysses
with
a
wise
caution
made
answer
that
they
had
no
ship
or
companions
but
were
unfortunate
men
whom
the
sea
splitting
their
ship
in
pieces
had
dashed
upon
his
coast
and
they
alone
had
escaped
he
replied
nothing
but
gripping
two
of
the
nearest
of
them
as
if
they
had
been
no
more
than
children
he
dashed
their
brains
out
against
the
earth
and
shocking
to
relate
tore
in
pieces
their
limbs
and
devoured
them
yet
warm
and
trembling
making
a
lion
meal
of
them
lapping
the
blood
for
the
cyclops
are
and
esteem
human
flesh
to
be
a
delicacy
far
above
goat
or
kid
though
by
reason
of
their
abhorred
customs
few
men
approach
their
coast
except
some
stragglers
or
now
and
then
a
shipwrecked
mariner
at
a
sight
so
horrid
ulysses
and
his
men
were
like
distracted
people
he
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
his
wicked
supper
drained
a
draught
of
goat
milk
down
his
prodigious
throat
and
lay
down
and
slept
among
his
goats
then
ulysses
drew
his
sword
and
half
resolved
to
thrust
it
with
all
his
might
in
at
the
bosom
of
the
sleeping
monster
but
wiser
thoughts
restrained
him
else
they
had
there
without
help
all
perished
for
none
but
polyphemus
himself
could
have
removed
that
mass
of
stone
which
he
had
placed
to
guard
the
entrance
so
they
were
constrained
to
abide
all
that
night
in
fear
when
day
came
the
cyclop
awoke
and
kindling
a
fire
made
his
breakfast
of
two
other
of
his
unfortunate
prisoners
then
milked
his
goats
as
he
was
accustomed
and
pushing
aside
the
vast
stone
and
shutting
it
again
when
he
had
done
upon
the
prisoners
with
as
much
ease
as
a
man
opens
and
shuts
a
quiver
lid
he
let
out
his
flock
and
drove
them
before
him
with
whistlings
as
sharp
as
winds
in
storms
to
the
mountains
then
ulysses
of
whose
strength
or
cunning
the
cyclop
seems
to
have
had
as
little
heed
as
of
an
infant
being
left
alone
with
the
remnant
of
his
men
which
the
cyclop
had
not
devoured
gave
manifest
proof
how
far
manly
wisdom
excels
brutish
force
he
chose
a
stake
from
among
the
wood
which
the
cyclop
had
piled
up
for
firing
in
length
and
thickness
like
a
mast
which
he
sharpened
and
hardened
in
the
fire
and
selected
four
men
and
instructed
them
what
they
should
do
with
this
stake
and
made
them
perfect
in
their
parts
when
the
evening
was
come
the
cyclop
drove
home
his
sheep
and
as
fortune
directed
it
either
of
purpose
or
that
his
memory
was
overruled
by
the
gods
to
his
hurt
as
in
the
issue
it
proved
he
drove
the
males
of
his
flock
contrary
to
his
custom
along
with
the
dams
into
the
pens
then
the
stone
of
the
cave
he
fell
to
his
horrible
supper
when
he
had
despatched
two
more
of
the
grecians
ulysses
waxed
bold
with
the
contemplation
of
his
project
and
took
a
bowl
of
greek
wine
and
merrily
dared
the
cyclop
to
drink
illustration
he
said
a
bowl
of
wine
from
the
hand
of
your
guest
cyclop
he
said
take
a
bowl
of
wine
from
the
hand
of
your
guest
it
may
serve
to
digest
the
man
flesh
that
you
have
eaten
and
show
what
drink
our
ship
held
before
it
went
down
all
i
ask
in
recompense
if
you
find
it
good
is
to
be
dismissed
in
a
whole
skin
truly
you
must
look
to
have
few
visitors
if
you
observe
this
new
custom
of
eating
your
guests
the
brute
took
and
drank
and
vehemently
enjoyed
the
taste
of
wine
which
was
new
to
him
and
swilled
again
at
the
flagon
and
entreated
for
more
and
prayed
ulysses
to
tell
him
his
name
that
he
might
bestow
a
gift
upon
the
man
who
had
given
him
such
brave
liquor
the
cyclops
he
said
had
grapes
but
this
rich
juice
he
swore
was
simply
divine
again
ulysses
plied
him
with
the
wine
and
the
fool
drank
it
as
fast
as
he
poured
out
and
again
he
asked
the
name
of
his
benefactor
which
ulysses
cunningly
dissembling
said
my
name
is
noman
my
kindred
and
friends
in
my
own
country
call
me
noman
then
said
the
cyclop
this
is
the
kindness
i
will
show
thee
noman
i
will
eat
thee
last
of
all
thy
friends
he
had
scarce
expressed
his
savage
kindness
when
the
fumes
of
the
strong
wine
overcame
him
and
he
reeled
down
upon
the
floor
and
sank
into
a
dead
sleep
ulysses
watched
his
time
while
the
monster
lay
insensible
and
heartening
up
his
men
they
placed
the
sharp
end
of
the
stake
in
the
fire
till
it
was
heated
and
some
god
gave
them
a
courage
beyond
that
which
they
were
used
to
have
and
the
four
men
with
difficulty
bored
the
sharp
end
of
the
huge
stake
which
they
had
heated
right
into
the
eye
of
the
drunken
cannibal
and
ulysses
helped
to
thrust
it
in
with
all
his
might
still
farther
and
farther
with
effort
as
men
bore
with
an
auger
till
the
scalded
blood
gushed
out
and
the
smoked
and
the
strings
of
the
eye
cracked
as
the
burning
rafter
broke
in
it
and
the
eye
hissed
as
hot
iron
hisses
when
it
is
plunged
into
water
he
waking
roared
with
the
pain
so
loud
that
all
the
cavern
broke
into
claps
like
thunder
they
fled
and
dispersed
into
corners
he
plucked
the
burning
stake
from
his
eye
and
hurled
the
wood
madly
about
the
cave
then
he
cried
out
with
a
mighty
voice
for
his
brethren
the
cyclops
that
dwelt
hard
by
in
caverns
upon
hills
they
hearing
the
terrible
shout
came
flocking
from
all
parts
to
inquire
what
ailed
polyphemus
and
what
cause
he
had
for
making
such
horrid
clamours
in
the
to
break
their
sleeps
if
his
fright
proceeded
from
any
mortal
if
strength
or
craft
had
given
him
his
death
blow
he
made
answer
from
within
that
noman
had
hurt
him
noman
had
killed
him
noman
was
with
him
in
the
cave
they
replied
if
no
man
has
hurt
thee
and
no
man
is
with
thee
then
thou
art
alone
and
the
evil
that
afflicts
thee
is
from
the
hand
of
heaven
which
none
can
resist
or
help
so
they
left
him
and
went
their
way
thinking
that
some
disease
troubled
him
he
blind
and
ready
to
split
with
the
anguish
of
the
pain
went
groaning
up
and
down
in
the
dark
to
find
the
doorway
which
when
he
found
he
removed
the
stone
and
sat
in
the
threshold
feeling
if
he
could
lay
hold
on
any
man
going
out
with
the
sheep
which
the
day
now
breaking
were
beginning
to
issue
forth
to
their
accustomed
pastures
but
ulysses
whose
first
artifice
in
giving
himself
that
ambiguous
name
had
succeeded
so
well
with
the
cyclop
was
not
of
a
wit
so
gross
to
be
caught
by
that
palpable
device
but
casting
about
in
his
mind
all
the
ways
which
he
could
contrive
for
escape
no
less
than
all
their
lives
depending
on
the
success
at
last
he
thought
of
this
expedient
he
made
knots
of
the
osier
twigs
upon
which
the
cyclop
commonly
slept
with
which
he
tied
the
fattest
and
fleeciest
of
the
rams
together
three
in
a
rank
and
under
the
belly
of
the
middle
ram
he
tied
a
man
and
himself
last
wrapping
himself
fast
with
both
his
hands
in
the
rich
wool
of
one
the
fairest
of
the
flock
and
now
the
sheep
began
to
issue
forth
very
fast
the
males
went
first
the
females
unmilked
stood
by
bleating
and
requiring
the
hand
of
their
shepherd
in
vain
to
milk
them
their
full
bags
sore
with
being
unemptied
but
he
much
sorer
with
the
loss
of
sight
still
as
the
males
passed
he
felt
the
backs
of
those
fleecy
fools
never
dreaming
that
they
carried
his
enemies
under
their
bellies
so
they
passed
on
till
the
last
ram
came
loaded
with
his
wool
and
ulysses
together
he
stopped
that
ram
and
felt
him
and
had
his
hand
once
in
the
hair
of
ulysses
yet
knew
it
not
and
he
chid
the
ram
for
being
last
and
spoke
to
it
as
if
it
understood
him
and
asked
it
whether
it
did
not
wish
that
its
master
had
his
eye
again
which
that
abominable
noman
with
his
execrable
rout
had
put
out
when
they
had
got
him
down
with
wine
and
he
willed
the
ram
to
tell
him
whereabouts
in
the
cave
his
enemy
lurked
that
he
might
dash
his
brains
and
strew
them
about
to
ease
his
heart
of
that
tormenting
revenge
which
rankled
in
it
after
a
deal
of
such
foolish
talk
to
the
beast
he
let
it
go
when
ulysses
found
himself
free
he
let
go
his
hold
and
assisted
in
disengaging
his
friends
the
rams
which
had
befriended
them
they
carried
off
with
them
to
the
ships
where
their
companions
with
tears
in
their
eyes
received
them
as
men
escaped
from
death
they
plied
their
oars
and
set
their
sails
and
when
they
were
got
as
far
off
from
shore
as
a
voice
could
reach
ulysses
cried
out
to
the
cyclop
cyclop
thou
shouldst
not
have
so
much
abused
thy
monstrous
strength
as
to
devour
thy
guests
jove
by
my
hand
sends
thee
requital
to
pay
thy
savage
inhumanity
the
cyclop
heard
and
came
forth
enraged
and
in
his
anger
he
plucked
a
fragment
of
a
rock
and
threw
it
with
blind
fury
at
the
ships
it
narrowly
escaped
lighting
upon
the
bark
in
which
ulysses
sat
but
with
the
fall
it
raised
so
fierce
an
ebb
as
bore
back
the
ship
till
it
almost
touched
the
shore
cyclop
said
ulysses
if
any
ask
thee
who
imposed
on
thee
that
unsightly
blemish
in
thine
eye
say
it
was
ulysses
son
of
laertes
the
king
of
ithaca
am
i
called
the
waster
of
cities
then
they
crowded
sail
and
beat
the
old
sea
and
forth
they
went
with
a
forward
gale
sad
for
losses
yet
glad
to
have
escaped
at
any
rate
till
they
came
to
the
isle
where
aeolus
reigned
who
is
god
of
the
winds
here
ulysses
and
his
men
were
courteously
received
by
the
monarch
who
showed
him
his
twelve
children
which
have
rule
over
the
twelve
winds
a
month
they
stayed
and
feasted
with
him
and
at
the
end
of
the
month
he
dismissed
them
with
many
presents
and
gave
to
ulysses
at
parting
an
hide
in
which
were
enclosed
the
only
he
left
abroad
the
western
wind
to
play
upon
their
sails
and
waft
them
gently
home
to
ithaca
this
bag
bound
in
a
glittering
silver
band
so
close
that
no
breath
could
escape
ulysses
hung
up
at
the
mast
his
companions
did
not
know
its
contents
but
guessed
that
the
monarch
had
given
to
him
some
treasures
of
gold
or
silver
nine
days
they
sailed
smoothly
favoured
by
the
western
wind
and
by
the
tenth
they
approached
so
nigh
as
to
discern
lights
kindled
on
the
shores
of
their
country
earth
when
by
ulysses
overcome
with
fatigue
of
watching
the
helm
fell
asleep
the
mariners
seized
the
opportunity
and
one
of
them
said
to
the
rest
a
fine
time
has
this
leader
of
ours
wherever
he
goes
he
is
sure
of
presents
when
we
come
away
and
see
what
king
aeolus
has
given
him
store
no
doubt
of
gold
and
silver
a
word
was
enough
to
those
covetous
wretches
who
quick
as
thought
untied
the
bag
and
instead
of
gold
out
rushed
with
mighty
noise
the
illustration
rushed
with
mighty
noise
all
the
ulysses
with
the
noise
awoke
and
saw
their
mistake
but
too
late
for
the
ship
was
driving
with
all
the
winds
back
far
from
ithaca
far
as
to
the
island
of
aeolus
from
which
they
had
parted
in
one
hour
measuring
back
what
in
nine
days
they
had
scarcely
tracked
and
in
sight
of
home
too
up
he
flew
amazed
and
raving
doubted
whether
he
should
not
fling
himself
into
the
sea
for
grief
of
his
bitter
disappointment
at
last
he
hid
himself
under
the
hatches
for
shame
and
scarce
could
he
be
prevailed
upon
when
he
was
told
he
was
arrived
again
in
the
harbour
of
king
aeolus
to
go
himself
or
send
to
that
monarch
for
a
second
succour
so
much
the
disgrace
of
having
misused
his
royal
bounty
though
it
was
the
crime
of
his
followers
and
not
his
own
weighed
upon
him
and
when
at
last
he
went
and
took
a
herald
with
him
and
came
where
the
god
sat
on
his
throne
feasting
with
his
children
he
would
not
thrust
in
among
them
at
their
meat
but
set
himself
down
like
one
unworthy
in
the
threshold
indignation
seized
aeolus
to
behold
him
in
that
manner
returned
and
he
said
ulysses
what
has
brought
you
back
are
you
so
soon
tired
of
your
country
or
did
not
our
present
please
you
we
thought
we
had
given
you
a
kingly
passport
ulysses
made
answer
my
men
have
done
this
ill
mischief
to
me
they
did
it
while
i
slept
wretch
said
aeolus
avaunt
and
quit
our
shores
it
fits
not
us
to
convoy
men
whom
the
gods
hate
and
will
have
perish
forth
they
sailed
but
with
far
different
hopes
than
when
they
left
the
same
harbour
the
first
time
with
all
the
winds
confined
only
the
west
wind
suffered
to
play
upon
their
sails
to
waft
them
in
gentle
murmurs
to
ithaca
they
were
now
the
sport
of
every
gale
that
blew
and
despaired
of
ever
seeing
home
more
now
those
covetous
mariners
were
cured
of
their
surfeit
for
gold
and
would
not
have
touched
it
if
it
had
lain
in
untold
heaps
before
them
six
days
and
nights
they
drove
along
and
on
the
seventh
day
they
put
into
lamos
a
port
of
the
laestrygonians
so
spacious
this
harbour
was
that
it
held
with
ease
all
their
fleet
which
rode
at
anchor
safe
from
any
storms
all
but
the
ship
in
which
ulysses
was
embarked
he
as
if
prophetic
of
the
mischance
which
followed
kept
still
without
the
harbour
making
fast
his
bark
to
a
rock
at
the
land
point
which
he
climbed
with
purpose
to
survey
the
country
he
saw
a
city
with
smoke
ascending
from
the
roofs
but
neither
ploughs
going
nor
oxen
yoked
nor
any
sign
of
agricultural
works
making
choice
of
two
men
he
sent
them
to
the
city
to
explore
what
sort
of
inhabitants
dwelt
there
his
messengers
had
not
gone
far
before
they
met
a
damsel
of
stature
surpassing
human
who
was
coming
to
draw
water
from
a
spring
they
asked
her
who
dwelt
in
that
land
she
made
no
reply
but
led
them
in
silence
to
her
father
palace
he
was
a
monarch
and
named
antiphas
he
and
all
his
people
were
giants
when
they
entered
the
palace
a
woman
the
mother
of
the
damsel
but
far
taller
than
she
rushed
abroad
and
called
for
antiphas
he
came
and
snatching
up
one
of
the
two
men
made
as
if
he
would
devour
him
the
other
fled
antiphas
raised
a
mighty
shout
and
instantly
this
way
and
that
multitudes
of
gigantic
people
issued
out
at
the
gates
and
making
for
the
harbour
tore
up
huge
pieces
of
the
rocks
and
flung
them
at
the
ships
which
lay
there
all
which
they
utterly
overwhelmed
and
sank
and
the
unfortunate
bodies
of
men
which
floated
and
which
the
sea
did
not
devour
these
cannibals
thrust
through
with
harpoons
like
fishes
and
bore
them
off
to
their
dire
feast
ulysses
with
his
single
bark
that
had
never
entered
the
harbour
escaped
that
bark
which
was
now
the
only
vessel
left
of
all
the
gallant
navy
that
had
set
sail
with
him
from
troy
he
pushed
off
from
the
shore
cheering
the
sad
remnant
of
his
men
whom
horror
at
the
sight
of
their
countrymen
fate
had
almost
turned
to
marble
chapter
two
the
house
of
men
changed
into
the
voyage
to
the
banquet
of
the
dead
on
went
the
single
ship
till
it
came
to
the
island
of
aeaea
where
circe
the
dreadful
daughter
of
the
sun
dwelt
she
was
deeply
skilled
in
magic
a
haughty
beauty
and
had
hair
like
the
sun
the
sun
was
her
parent
and
begot
her
and
her
brother
aeaetes
such
another
as
herself
upon
perse
daughter
to
oceanus
here
a
dispute
arose
among
ulysses
men
which
of
them
should
go
ashore
and
explore
the
country
for
there
was
a
necessity
that
some
should
go
to
procure
water
and
provisions
their
stock
of
both
being
nigh
spent
but
their
hearts
failed
them
when
they
called
to
mind
the
shocking
fate
of
their
fellows
whom
the
laestrygonians
had
eaten
and
those
which
the
foul
cyclop
polyphemus
had
crushed
between
his
jaws
which
moved
them
so
tenderly
in
the
recollection
that
they
wept
but
tears
never
yet
supplied
any
man
wants
this
ulysses
knew
full
well
and
dividing
his
men
all
that
were
left
into
two
companies
at
the
head
of
one
of
which
was
himself
and
at
the
head
of
the
other
eurylochus
a
man
of
tried
courage
he
cast
lots
which
of
them
should
go
up
into
the
country
and
the
lot
fell
upon
eurylochus
and
his
company
in
number
who
took
their
leave
with
tears
of
ulysses
and
his
men
that
stayed
whose
eyes
wore
the
same
wet
badges
of
weak
humanity
for
they
surely
thought
never
to
see
these
their
companions
again
but
that
on
every
coast
where
they
should
come
they
should
find
nothing
but
savages
and
cannibals
eurylochus
and
his
party
proceeded
up
the
country
till
in
a
dale
they
descried
the
house
of
circe
built
of
bright
stone
by
the
roadside
before
her
gate
lay
many
beasts
as
wolves
lions
leopards
which
by
her
art
of
wild
she
had
rendered
tame
these
arose
when
they
saw
strangers
and
ramped
upon
their
hinder
paws
and
fawned
upon
eurylochus
and
his
men
who
dreaded
the
effects
of
such
monstrous
kindness
and
staying
at
the
gate
they
heard
the
enchantress
within
sitting
at
her
loom
singing
such
strains
as
suspended
all
mortal
faculties
while
she
wove
a
web
subtile
and
glorious
and
of
texture
inimitable
on
earth
as
all
the
housewiferies
of
the
deities
are
strains
so
ravishingly
sweet
provoked
even
the
sagest
and
prudentest
heads
among
the
party
to
knock
and
call
at
the
gate
the
shining
gate
the
enchantress
opened
and
bade
them
come
in
and
feast
they
unwise
followed
all
but
eurylochus
who
stayed
without
the
gate
suspicious
that
some
train
was
laid
for
them
being
entered
she
placed
them
in
chairs
of
state
and
set
before
them
meal
and
honey
and
smyrna
wine
but
mixed
with
baneful
drugs
of
powerful
enchantment
when
they
had
eaten
of
these
and
drunk
of
her
cup
she
touched
them
with
her
and
straight
they
were
transformed
into
swine
having
the
bodies
of
swine
the
bristles
and
snout
and
grunting
noise
of
that
animal
only
they
still
retained
the
minds
of
men
which
made
them
the
more
to
lament
their
brutish
transformation
having
changed
them
she
shut
them
up
in
her
sty
with
many
more
whom
her
wicked
sorceries
had
formerly
changed
and
gave
them
swine
food
mast
and
acorns
and
chestnuts
to
eat
illustration
straight
they
were
transformed
into
eurylochus
who
beheld
nothing
of
these
sad
changes
from
where
he
was
stationed
without
the
gate
only
instead
of
his
companions
that
entered
who
he
thought
had
all
vanished
by
witchcraft
beheld
a
herd
of
swine
hurried
back
to
the
ship
to
give
an
account
of
what
he
had
seen
but
so
frighted
and
perplexed
that
he
could
give
no
distinct
report
of
anything
only
he
remembered
a
palace
and
a
woman
singing
at
her
work
and
gates
guarded
by
lions
but
his
companions
he
said
were
all
vanished
then
ulysses
suspecting
some
foul
witchcraft
snatched
his
sword
and
his
bow
and
commanded
eurylochus
instantly
to
lead
him
to
the
place
but
eurylochus
fell
down
and
embracing
his
knees
besought
him
by
the
name
of
a
man
whom
the
gods
had
in
their
protection
not
to
expose
his
safety
and
the
safety
of
them
all
to
certain
destruction
do
thou
then
stay
eurylochus
answered
ulysses
eat
thou
and
drink
in
the
ship
in
safety
while
i
go
alone
upon
this
adventure
necessity
from
whose
law
is
no
appeal
compels
me
so
saying
he
quitted
the
ship
and
went
on
shore
accompanied
by
none
none
had
the
hardihood
to
offer
to
partake
that
perilous
adventure
with
him
so
much
they
dreaded
the
enchantments
of
the
witch
singly
he
pursued
his
journey
till
he
came
to
the
shining
gates
which
stood
before
her
mansion
but
when
he
essayed
to
put
his
foot
over
her
threshold
he
was
suddenly
stopped
by
the
apparition
of
a
young
man
bearing
a
golden
rod
in
his
hand
who
was
the
god
mercury
he
held
ulysses
by
the
wrist
to
stay
his
entrance
and
whither
wouldest
thou
go
he
said
o
thou
most
erring
of
the
sons
of
men
knowest
thou
not
that
this
is
the
house
of
great
circe
where
she
keeps
thy
friends
in
a
loathsome
sty
changed
from
the
fair
forms
of
men
into
the
detestable
and
ugly
shapes
of
swine
art
thou
prepared
to
share
their
fate
from
which
nothing
can
ransom
thee
but
neither
his
words
nor
his
coming
from
heaven
could
stop
the
daring
foot
of
ulysses
whom
compassion
for
the
misfortune
of
his
friends
had
rendered
careless
of
danger
which
when
the
god
perceived
he
had
pity
to
see
valour
so
misplaced
and
gave
him
the
flower
of
the
herb
which
is
sovereign
against
enchantments
the
moly
is
a
small
unsightly
root
its
virtues
but
little
known
and
in
low
estimation
the
dull
shepherd
treads
on
it
every
day
with
his
clouted
shoes
but
it
bears
a
small
white
flower
which
is
medicinal
against
charms
blights
mildews
and
damps
take
this
in
thy
hand
said
mercury
and
with
it
boldly
enter
her
gates
when
she
shall
strike
thee
with
her
rod
thinking
to
change
thee
as
she
has
changed
thy
friends
boldly
rush
in
upon
her
with
thy
sword
and
extort
from
her
the
dreadful
oath
of
the
gods
that
she
will
use
no
enchantments
against
thee
then
force
her
to
restore
thy
abused
companions
he
gave
ulysses
the
little
white
flower
and
instructing
him
how
to
use
it
vanished
when
the
god
was
departed
ulysses
with
loud
knockings
beat
at
the
gate
of
the
palace
the
shining
gates
were
opened
as
before
and
great
circe
with
hospitable
cheer
invited
in
her
guest
she
placed
him
on
a
throne
with
more
distinction
than
she
had
used
to
his
fellows
she
mingled
wine
in
a
costly
bowl
and
he
drank
of
it
mixed
with
those
poisonous
drugs
when
he
had
drunk
she
struck
him
with
her
and
to
your
sty
she
cried
out
swine
mingle
with
your
companions
but
those
powerful
words
were
not
proof
against
the
preservative
which
mercury
had
given
to
ulysses
he
remained
unchanged
and
as
the
god
had
directed
him
boldly
charged
the
witch
with
his
sword
as
if
he
meant
to
take
her
life
which
when
she
saw
and
perceived
that
her
charms
were
weak
against
the
antidote
which
ulysses
bore
about
him
she
cried
out
and
bent
her
knees
beneath
his
sword
embracing
his
and
said
who
or
what
manner
of
man
art
thou
never
drank
any
man
before
thee
of
this
cup
but
he
repented
it
in
some
form
thy
shape
remains
unaltered
as
thy
mind
thou
canst
be
none
other
than
ulysses
renowned
above
all
the
world
for
wisdom
whom
the
fates
have
long
since
decreed
that
i
must
love
this
haughty
bosom
bends
to
thee
o
ithacan
a
goddess
wooes
thee
to
her
bed
illustration
or
what
manner
of
man
art
thou
o
circe
he
replied
how
canst
thou
treat
of
love
or
marriage
with
one
whose
friends
thou
hast
turned
into
beasts
and
now
offerest
him
thy
hand
in
wedlock
only
that
thou
mightest
have
him
in
thy
power
to
live
the
life
of
a
beast
with
thee
naked
effeminate
subject
to
thy
will
perhaps
to
be
advanced
in
time
to
the
honour
of
a
place
in
thy
sty
what
pleasure
canst
thou
promise
which
may
tempt
the
soul
of
a
reasonable
man
thy
meats
spiced
with
poison
or
thy
wines
drugged
with
death
thou
must
swear
to
me
that
thou
wilt
never
attempt
against
me
the
treasons
which
thou
hast
practised
upon
my
friends
the
enchantress
won
by
the
terror
of
his
threats
or
by
the
violence
of
that
new
love
which
she
felt
kindling
in
her
veins
for
him
swore
by
styx
the
great
oath
of
the
gods
that
she
meditated
no
injury
to
him
then
ulysses
made
show
of
gentler
treatment
which
gave
her
hopes
of
inspiring
him
with
a
passion
equal
to
that
which
she
felt
she
called
her
handmaids
four
that
served
her
in
chief
who
were
daughters
to
her
silver
fountains
to
her
sacred
rivers
and
to
her
consecrated
woods
to
deck
her
apartments
to
spread
rich
carpets
and
set
out
her
silver
tables
with
dishes
of
the
purest
gold
and
meat
as
precious
as
that
which
the
gods
eat
to
entertain
her
guest
one
brought
water
to
wash
his
feet
and
one
brought
wine
to
chase
away
with
a
refreshing
sweetness
the
sorrows
that
had
come
of
late
so
thick
upon
him
and
hurt
his
noble
mind
they
strewed
perfumes
on
his
head
and
after
he
had
bathed
in
a
bath
of
the
choicest
aromatics
they
brought
him
rich
and
costly
apparel
to
put
on
then
he
was
conducted
to
a
throne
of
massy
silver
and
a
regale
fit
for
jove
when
he
banquets
was
placed
before
him
but
the
feast
which
ulysses
desired
was
to
see
his
friends
the
partners
of
his
voyage
once
more
in
the
shapes
of
men
and
the
food
which
could
give
him
nourishment
must
be
taken
in
at
his
eyes
because
he
missed
this
sight
he
sat
melancholy
and
thoughtful
and
would
taste
of
none
of
the
rich
delicacies
placed
before
him
which
when
circe
noted
she
easily
divined
the
cause
of
his
sadness
and
leaving
the
seat
in
which
she
sat
throned
went
to
her
sty
and
let
abroad
his
men
who
came
in
like
swine
and
filled
the
ample
hall
where
ulysses
sat
with
gruntings
hardly
had
he
time
to
let
his
sad
eye
run
over
their
altered
forms
and
brutal
metamorphosis
when
with
an
ointment
which
she
smeared
over
them
suddenly
their
bristles
fell
off
and
they
started
up
in
their
own
shapes
men
as
before
they
knew
their
leader
again
and
clung
about
him
with
joy
of
their
late
restoration
and
some
shame
for
their
late
change
and
wept
so
loud
blubbering
out
their
joy
in
broken
accents
that
the
palace
was
filled
with
a
sound
of
pleasing
mourning
and
the
witch
herself
great
circe
was
not
unmoved
at
the
sight
to
make
her
atonement
complete
she
sent
for
the
remnant
of
ulysses
men
who
stayed
behind
at
the
ship
giving
up
their
great
commander
for
lost
who
when
they
came
and
saw
him
again
alive
circled
with
their
fellows
no
expression
can
tell
what
joy
they
felt
they
even
cried
out
with
rapture
and
to
have
seen
their
frantic
expressions
of
mirth
a
man
might
have
supposed
that
they
were
just
in
sight
of
their
country
earth
the
cliffs
of
rocky
ithaca
only
eurylochus
would
hardly
be
persuaded
to
enter
that
palace
of
wonders
for
he
remembered
with
a
kind
of
horror
how
his
companions
had
vanished
from
his
sight
then
great
circe
spake
and
gave
order
that
there
should
be
no
more
sadness
among
them
nor
remembering
of
past
sufferings
for
as
yet
they
fared
like
men
that
are
exiles
from
their
country
and
if
a
gleam
of
mirth
shot
among
them
it
was
suddenly
quenched
with
the
thought
of
their
helpless
and
homeless
condition
her
kind
persuasions
wrought
upon
ulysses
and
the
rest
and
they
spent
twelve
months
in
all
manner
of
delight
with
her
in
her
palace
for
circe
was
a
powerful
magician
and
could
command
the
moon
from
her
sphere
or
unroot
the
solid
oak
from
its
place
to
make
it
dance
for
their
diversion
and
by
the
help
of
her
illusions
she
could
vary
the
taste
of
pleasures
and
contrive
delights
recreations
and
jolly
pastimes
to
fetch
the
day
about
from
sun
to
sun
and
rock
the
tedious
year
as
in
a
delightful
dream
at
length
ulysses
awoke
from
the
trance
of
the
faculties
into
which
her
charms
had
thrown
him
and
the
thought
of
home
returned
with
tenfold
vigour
to
goad
and
sting
him
that
home
where
he
had
left
his
virtuous
wife
penelope
and
his
young
son
telemachus
one
day
when
circe
had
been
lavish
of
her
caresses
and
was
in
her
kindest
humour
he
moved
her
subtly
and
as
it
were
afar
off
the
question
of
his
to
which
she
answered
firmly
o
ulysses
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
detain
one
whom
the
gods
have
destined
to
further
trials
but
leaving
me
before
you
pursue
your
journey
home
you
must
visit
the
house
of
ades
or
death
to
consult
the
shade
of
tiresias
the
theban
prophet
to
whom
alone
of
all
the
dead
proserpine
queen
of
hell
has
committed
the
secret
of
future
events
it
is
he
that
must
inform
you
whether
you
shall
ever
see
again
your
wife
and
country
o
circe
he
cried
that
is
impossible
who
shall
steer
my
course
to
pluto
kingdom
never
ship
had
strength
to
make
that
voyage
seek
no
guide
she
replied
but
raise
you
your
mast
and
hoist
your
white
sails
and
sit
in
your
ship
in
peace
the
north
wind
shall
waft
you
through
the
seas
till
you
shall
cross
the
expanse
of
the
ocean
and
come
to
where
grow
the
poplar
groves
and
willows
pale
of
proserpine
where
pyriphlegethon
and
cocytus
and
acheron
mingle
their
waves
cocytus
is
an
arm
of
styx
the
forgetful
river
here
dig
a
pit
and
make
it
a
cubit
broad
and
a
cubit
long
and
pour
in
milk
and
honey
and
wine
and
the
blood
of
a
ram
and
the
blood
of
a
black
ewe
and
turn
away
thy
face
while
thou
pourest
in
and
the
dead
shall
come
flocking
to
taste
the
milk
and
the
blood
but
suffer
none
to
approach
thy
offering
till
thou
hast
inquired
of
tiresias
all
which
thou
wishest
to
know
he
did
as
great
circe
had
appointed
he
raised
his
mast
and
hoisted
his
white
sails
and
sat
in
his
ship
in
peace
the
north
wind
wafted
him
through
the
seas
till
he
crossed
the
ocean
and
came
to
the
sacred
woods
of
proserpine
he
stood
at
the
confluence
of
the
three
floods
and
digged
a
pit
as
she
had
given
directions
and
poured
in
his
offering
the
blood
of
a
ram
and
the
blood
of
a
black
ewe
milk
and
honey
and
wine
and
the
dead
came
to
his
banquet
aged
men
and
women
and
youths
and
children
who
died
in
infancy
but
none
of
them
would
he
suffer
to
approach
and
dip
their
thin
lips
in
the
offering
till
tiresias
was
served
not
though
his
own
mother
was
among
the
number
whom
now
for
the
first
time
he
knew
to
be
dead
for
he
had
left
her
living
when
he
went
to
troy
and
she
had
died
since
his
departure
and
the
tidings
never
reached
him
though
it
irked
his
soul
to
use
constraint
upon
her
yet
in
compliance
with
the
injunction
of
great
circe
he
forced
her
to
retire
along
with
the
other
ghosts
then
tiresias
who
bore
a
golden
sceptre
came
and
lapped
of
the
offering
and
immediately
he
knew
ulysses
and
began
to
prophesy
denounced
woe
to
ulysses
woe
woe
and
many
sufferings
through
the
anger
of
neptune
for
the
putting
out
of
the
eye
of
the
son
yet
there
was
safety
after
suffering
if
they
could
abstain
from
slaughtering
the
oxen
of
the
sun
after
they
landed
in
the
triangular
island
for
ulysses
the
gods
had
destined
him
from
a
king
to
become
a
beggar
and
to
perish
by
his
own
guests
unless
he
slew
those
who
knew
him
illustration
the
dead
came
to
his
this
prophecy
ambiguously
delivered
was
all
that
tiresias
was
empowered
to
unfold
or
else
there
was
no
longer
place
for
him
for
now
the
souls
of
the
other
dead
came
flocking
in
such
numbers
tumultuously
demanding
the
blood
that
freezing
horror
seized
the
limbs
of
the
living
ulysses
to
see
so
many
and
all
dead
and
he
the
only
one
alive
in
that
region
now
his
mother
came
and
lapped
the
blood
without
restraint
from
her
son
and
now
she
knew
him
to
be
her
son
and
inquired
of
him
why
he
had
come
alive
to
their
comfortless
habitations
and
she
said
that
affliction
for
long
absence
had
preyed
upon
her
spirits
and
brought
her
to
the
grave
ulysses
soul
melted
at
her
moving
narration
and
forgetting
the
state
of
the
dead
and
that
the
airy
texture
of
disembodied
spirits
does
not
admit
of
the
embraces
of
flesh
and
blood
he
threw
his
arms
about
her
to
clasp
her
the
poor
ghost
melted
from
his
embrace
and
looking
mournfully
upon
him
vanished
away
then
saw
he
other
females
tyro
who
when
she
lived
was
the
paramour
of
neptune
and
by
him
had
pelias
and
neleus
antiope
who
bore
two
like
sons
to
jove
amphion
and
zethus
founders
of
thebes
alcmena
the
mother
of
hercules
with
her
fair
daughter
afterwards
her
megara
there
also
ulysses
saw
jocasta
the
unfortunate
mother
and
wife
of
oedipus
who
ignorant
of
kin
wedded
with
her
son
and
when
she
had
discovered
the
unnatural
alliance
for
shame
and
grief
hanged
herself
he
continued
to
drag
a
wretched
life
above
the
earth
haunted
by
the
dreadful
furies
there
was
leda
the
wife
of
tyndarus
the
mother
of
the
beautiful
helen
and
of
the
two
brave
brothers
castor
and
pollux
who
obtained
this
grace
from
jove
that
being
dead
they
should
enjoy
life
alternately
living
in
pleasant
places
under
the
earth
for
pollux
had
prayed
that
his
brother
castor
who
was
subject
to
death
as
the
son
of
tyndarus
should
partake
of
his
own
immortality
which
he
derived
from
an
immortal
sire
this
the
fates
denied
therefore
pollux
was
permitted
to
divide
his
immortality
with
his
brother
castor
dying
and
living
alternately
there
was
iphimedia
who
bore
two
sons
to
neptune
that
were
giants
otus
and
ephialtes
earth
in
her
prodigality
never
nourished
bodies
to
such
portentous
size
and
beauty
as
these
two
children
were
of
except
orion
at
nine
years
old
they
had
imaginations
of
climbing
to
heaven
to
see
what
the
gods
were
doing
they
thought
to
make
stairs
of
mountains
and
were
for
piling
ossa
upon
olympus
and
setting
pelion
upon
that
and
had
perhaps
performed
it
if
they
had
lived
till
they
were
striplings
but
they
were
cut
off
by
death
in
the
infancy
of
their
ambitious
project
phaedra
was
there
and
procris
and
ariadne
mournful
for
theseus
desertion
and
maera
and
clymene
and
eryphile
who
preferred
gold
before
wedlock
faith
but
now
came
a
mournful
ghost
that
late
was
agamemnon
son
of
atreus
the
mighty
leader
of
all
the
host
of
greece
and
their
confederate
kings
that
warred
against
troy
he
came
with
the
rest
to
sip
a
little
of
the
blood
at
that
uncomfortable
banquet
ulysses
was
moved
with
compassion
to
see
him
among
them
and
asked
him
what
untimely
fate
had
brought
him
there
if
storms
had
overwhelmed
him
coming
from
troy
or
if
he
had
perished
in
some
mutiny
by
his
own
soldiers
at
a
division
of
the
prey
by
none
of
these
he
replied
did
i
come
to
my
death
but
slain
at
a
banquet
to
which
i
was
invited
by
aegisthus
after
my
return
home
he
conspiring
with
my
adulterous
wife
they
laid
a
scheme
for
my
destruction
training
me
forth
to
a
banquet
as
an
ox
goes
to
the
slaughter
and
there
surrounding
me
they
slew
me
with
all
my
friends
about
me
clytemnestra
my
wicked
wife
forgetting
the
vows
which
she
swore
to
me
in
wedlock
would
not
lend
a
hand
to
close
my
eyes
in
death
but
nothing
is
so
heaped
with
impieties
as
such
a
woman
who
would
kill
her
spouse
that
married
her
a
maid
when
i
brought
her
home
to
my
house
a
bride
i
hoped
in
my
heart
that
she
would
be
loving
to
me
and
to
my
children
now
her
black
treacheries
have
cast
a
foul
aspersion
on
her
whole
sex
blessed
husbands
will
have
their
loving
wives
in
suspicion
for
her
bad
deeds
alas
said
ulysses
there
seems
to
be
a
fatality
in
your
royal
house
of
atreus
and
that
they
are
hated
of
jove
for
their
wives
for
helen
sake
your
brother
menelaus
wife
what
multitudes
fell
in
the
wars
of
troy
agamemnon
replied
for
this
cause
be
not
thou
more
kind
than
wise
to
any
woman
let
not
thy
words
express
to
her
at
any
time
all
that
is
in
thy
mind
keep
still
some
secrets
to
thyself
but
thou
by
any
bloody
contrivances
of
thy
wife
never
needst
fear
to
fall
exceeding
wise
she
is
and
to
her
wisdom
she
has
a
goodness
as
eminent
icarius
daughter
penelope
the
chaste
we
left
her
a
young
bride
when
we
parted
from
our
wives
to
go
to
the
wars
her
first
child
sucking
at
her
breast
the
young
telemachus
whom
you
shall
see
grown
up
to
manhood
on
your
return
and
he
shall
greet
his
father
with
befitting
welcomes
my
orestes
my
dear
son
i
shall
never
see
again
his
mother
has
deprived
his
father
of
the
sight
of
him
and
perhaps
will
slay
him
as
she
slew
his
sire
it
is
now
no
world
to
trust
a
woman
in
but
what
says
fame
is
my
son
yet
alive
lives
he
in
orchomen
or
in
pylus
or
is
he
resident
in
sparta
in
his
uncle
court
as
yet
i
see
divine
orestes
is
not
here
with
me
to
this
ulysses
replied
that
he
had
received
no
certain
tidings
where
orestes
abode
only
some
uncertain
rumours
which
he
could
not
report
for
truth
while
they
held
this
sad
conference
with
kind
tears
striving
to
render
unkind
fortunes
more
palatable
the
soul
of
great
achilles
joined
them
what
desperate
adventure
has
brought
ulysses
to
these
regions
said
achilles
to
see
the
end
of
dead
men
and
their
foolish
shades
ulysses
answered
him
that
he
had
come
to
consult
tiresias
respecting
his
voyage
home
but
thou
o
son
of
thetis
said
he
why
dost
thou
disparage
the
state
of
the
dead
seeing
that
as
alive
thou
didst
surpass
all
men
in
glory
thou
must
needs
retain
thy
here
below
so
great
achilles
triumphs
over
death
but
achilles
made
reply
that
he
had
much
rather
be
a
peasant
slave
upon
the
earth
than
reign
over
all
the
dead
so
much
did
the
inactivity
and
slothful
condition
of
that
state
displease
his
unquenchable
and
restless
spirit
only
he
inquired
of
ulysses
if
his
father
peleus
were
living
and
how
his
son
neoptolemus
conducted
himself
of
peleus
ulysses
could
tell
him
nothing
but
of
neoptolemus
he
thus
bore
witness
from
scyros
i
convoyed
your
son
by
sea
to
the
greeks
where
i
can
speak
of
him
for
i
knew
him
he
was
chief
in
council
and
in
the
field
when
any
question
was
proposed
so
quick
was
his
conceit
in
the
forward
apprehension
of
any
case
that
he
ever
spoke
first
and
was
heard
with
more
attention
than
the
older
heads
only
myself
and
aged
nestor
could
compare
with
him
in
giving
advice
in
battle
i
can
not
speak
his
praise
unless
i
could
count
all
that
fell
by
his
sword
i
will
only
mention
one
instance
of
his
manhood
when
we
sat
hid
in
the
belly
of
the
wooden
horse
in
the
ambush
which
deceived
the
trojans
to
their
destruction
i
who
had
the
management
of
that
stratagem
still
shifted
my
place
from
side
to
side
to
note
the
behaviour
of
our
men
in
some
i
marked
their
hearts
trembling
through
all
the
pains
which
they
took
to
appear
valiant
and
in
others
tears
that
in
spite
of
manly
courage
would
gush
forth
and
to
say
truth
it
was
an
adventure
of
high
enterprise
and
as
perilous
a
stake
as
was
ever
played
in
war
game
but
in
him
i
could
not
observe
the
least
sign
of
weakness
no
tears
nor
tremblings
but
his
hand
still
on
his
good
sword
and
ever
urging
me
to
set
open
the
machine
and
let
us
out
before
the
time
was
come
for
doing
it
and
when
we
sallied
out
he
was
still
first
in
that
fierce
destruction
and
bloody
midnight
desolation
of
king
priam
city
this
made
the
soul
of
achilles
to
tread
a
swifter
pace
with
feet
as
he
vanished
away
for
the
joy
which
he
took
in
his
son
being
applauded
by
ulysses
a
sad
shade
stalked
by
which
ulysses
knew
to
be
the
ghost
of
ajax
his
opponent
when
living
in
that
famous
dispute
about
the
right
of
succeeding
to
the
arms
of
the
deceased
achilles
they
being
adjudged
by
the
greeks
to
ulysses
as
the
prize
of
wisdom
above
bodily
strength
the
noble
ajax
in
despite
went
mad
and
slew
himself
the
sight
of
his
rival
turned
to
a
shade
by
his
dispute
so
subdued
the
passion
of
emulation
in
ulysses
that
for
his
sake
he
wished
that
judgment
in
that
controversy
had
been
given
against
himself
rather
than
so
illustrious
a
chief
should
have
perished
for
the
desire
of
those
arms
which
his
prowess
second
only
to
achilles
in
fight
so
eminently
had
deserved
ajax
he
cried
all
the
greeks
mourn
for
thee
as
much
as
they
lamented
for
achilles
let
not
thy
wrath
burn
forever
great
son
of
telamon
ulysses
seeks
peace
with
thee
and
will
make
any
atonement
to
thee
that
can
appease
thy
hurt
spirit
but
the
shade
stalked
on
and
would
not
exchange
a
word
with
ulysses
though
he
prayed
it
with
many
tears
and
many
earnest
entreaties
he
might
have
spoke
to
me
said
ulysses
since
i
spoke
to
him
but
i
see
the
resentments
of
the
dead
are
eternal
then
ulysses
saw
a
throne
on
which
was
placed
a
judge
distributing
sentence
he
that
sat
on
the
throne
was
minos
and
he
was
dealing
out
just
judgments
to
the
dead
he
it
is
that
assigns
them
their
place
in
bliss
or
woe
then
came
by
a
thundering
ghost
the
orion
the
mighty
hunter
who
was
hunting
there
the
ghosts
of
the
beasts
which
he
had
slaughtered
in
desert
hills
upon
the
earth
for
the
dead
delight
in
the
occupations
which
pleased
them
in
the
time
of
their
living
upon
the
earth
there
was
tityus
suffering
eternal
pains
because
he
had
sought
to
violate
the
honour
of
latona
as
she
passed
from
pytho
into
panopeus
two
vultures
sat
perpetually
preying
upon
his
liver
with
their
crooked
beaks
which
as
fast
as
they
devoured
is
forever
renewed
nor
can
he
fray
them
away
with
his
great
hands
there
was
tantalus
plagued
for
his
great
sins
standing
up
to
his
chin
in
water
which
he
can
never
taste
but
still
as
he
bows
his
head
thinking
to
quench
his
burning
thirst
instead
of
water
he
licks
up
unsavory
dust
all
fruits
pleasant
to
the
sight
and
of
delicious
flavor
hang
in
ripe
clusters
about
his
head
seeming
as
though
they
offered
themselves
to
be
plucked
by
him
but
when
he
reaches
out
his
hand
some
wind
carries
them
far
out
of
his
sight
into
the
clouds
so
he
is
starved
in
the
midst
of
plenty
by
the
righteous
doom
of
jove
in
memory
of
that
inhuman
banquet
at
which
the
sun
turned
pale
when
the
unnatural
father
served
up
the
limbs
of
his
little
son
in
a
dish
as
meat
for
his
divine
guests
there
was
sisyphus
that
sees
no
end
to
his
labours
his
punishment
is
to
be
forever
rolling
up
a
vast
stone
to
the
top
of
a
mountain
which
when
it
gets
to
the
top
falls
down
with
a
crushing
weight
and
all
his
work
is
to
be
begun
again
he
was
bathed
all
over
in
sweat
that
reeked
out
a
smoke
which
covered
his
head
like
a
mist
his
crime
had
been
the
revealing
of
state
secrets
there
ulysses
saw
hercules
not
that
hercules
who
enjoys
immortal
life
in
heaven
among
the
gods
and
is
married
to
hebe
or
youth
but
his
shadow
which
remains
below
about
him
the
dead
flocked
as
thick
as
bats
hovering
around
and
cuffing
at
his
head
he
stands
with
his
dreadful
bow
ever
in
the
act
to
shoot
there
also
might
ulysses
have
seen
and
spoken
with
the
shades
of
theseus
and
pirithous
and
the
old
heroes
but
he
had
conversed
enough
with
horrors
therefore
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
that
he
might
see
no
more
spectres
he
resumed
his
seat
in
his
ship
and
pushed
off
the
bark
moved
of
itself
without
the
help
of
any
oar
and
soon
brought
him
out
of
the
regions
of
death
into
the
cheerful
quarters
of
the
living
and
to
the
island
of
aeaea
whence
he
had
set
forth
chapter
three
the
song
of
the
scylla
and
the
oxen
of
the
the
the
crew
killed
by
lightning
unhappy
man
who
at
thy
birth
wast
appointed
twice
to
die
others
shall
die
once
but
thou
besides
that
death
that
remains
for
thee
common
to
all
men
hast
in
thy
lifetime
visited
the
shades
of
death
thee
scylla
thee
charybdis
expect
thee
the
deathful
sirens
lie
in
wait
for
that
taint
the
minds
of
whoever
listen
to
them
with
their
sweet
singing
whosoever
shall
but
hear
the
call
of
any
siren
he
will
so
despise
both
wife
and
children
through
their
sorceries
that
the
stream
of
his
affection
never
again
shall
set
homewards
nor
shall
he
take
joy
in
wife
or
children
thereafter
or
they
in
him
with
these
prophetic
greetings
great
circe
met
ulysses
on
his
return
he
besought
her
to
instruct
him
in
the
nature
of
the
sirens
and
by
what
method
their
baneful
allurements
were
to
be
resisted
they
are
sisters
three
she
replied
that
sit
in
a
mead
by
which
your
ship
must
needs
pass
circled
with
dead
men
bones
these
are
the
bones
of
men
whom
they
have
slain
after
with
fawning
invitements
they
have
enticed
them
into
their
fen
yet
such
is
the
celestial
harmony
of
their
voice
accompanying
the
persuasive
magic
of
their
words
that
knowing
this
you
shall
not
be
able
to
withstand
their
enticements
therefore
when
you
are
to
sail
by
them
you
shall
stop
the
ears
of
your
companions
with
wax
that
they
may
hear
no
note
of
that
dangerous
music
but
for
yourself
that
you
may
hear
and
yet
live
give
them
strict
command
to
bind
you
hand
and
foot
to
the
mast
and
in
no
case
to
set
you
free
till
you
are
out
of
the
danger
of
the
temptation
though
you
should
entreat
it
and
implore
it
ever
so
much
but
to
bind
you
rather
the
more
for
your
requesting
to
be
loosed
so
shall
you
escape
that
snare
ulysses
then
prayed
her
that
she
would
inform
him
what
scylla
and
charybdis
were
which
she
had
taught
him
by
name
to
fear
she
replied
sailing
from
aeaea
to
trinacria
you
must
pass
at
an
equal
distance
between
two
fatal
rocks
incline
never
so
little
either
to
the
one
side
or
the
other
and
your
ship
must
meet
with
certain
destruction
no
vessel
ever
yet
tried
that
pass
without
being
lost
but
the
argo
which
owed
her
safety
to
the
sacred
freight
she
bore
the
fleece
of
the
ram
which
could
not
perish
the
biggest
of
these
rocks
which
you
shall
come
to
scylla
hath
in
charge
there
in
a
deep
whirlpool
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
the
abhorred
monster
shrouds
her
face
who
if
she
were
to
show
her
full
form
no
eye
of
man
or
god
could
endure
the
sight
thence
she
stretches
out
all
her
six
long
necks
peering
and
diving
to
suck
up
fish
dolphins
and
whales
whole
ships
and
their
men
whatever
comes
within
her
raging
gulf
the
other
rock
is
lesser
and
of
less
ominous
aspect
but
there
dreadful
charybdis
sits
supping
the
black
deeps
thrice
a
day
she
drinks
her
pits
dry
and
thrice
a
day
again
she
belches
them
all
up
but
when
she
is
drinking
come
not
nigh
for
being
once
caught
the
force
of
neptune
can
not
redeem
you
from
her
swallow
better
trust
to
scylla
for
she
will
but
have
for
her
six
necks
six
men
charybdis
in
her
insatiate
draught
will
ask
all
then
ulysses
inquired
in
case
he
should
escape
charybdis
whether
he
might
not
assail
that
other
monster
with
his
sword
to
which
she
replied
that
he
must
not
think
that
he
had
an
enemy
subject
to
death
or
wounds
to
contend
with
for
scylla
could
never
die
therefore
his
best
safety
was
in
flight
and
to
invoke
none
of
the
gods
but
gratis
who
is
mother
and
might
perhaps
forbid
her
daughter
to
devour
them
for
his
conduct
after
he
arrived
at
trinacria
she
referred
him
to
the
admonitions
which
had
been
given
him
by
tiresias
ulysses
having
communicated
her
instructions
as
far
as
related
to
the
sirens
to
his
companions
who
had
not
been
present
at
that
interview
but
concealing
from
them
the
rest
as
he
had
done
the
terrible
predictions
of
tiresias
that
they
might
not
be
deterred
by
fear
from
pursuing
their
voyage
the
time
for
departure
being
come
they
set
their
sails
and
took
a
final
leave
of
great
circe
who
by
her
art
calmed
the
heavens
and
gave
them
smooth
seas
and
a
right
forewind
the
seaman
friend
to
bear
them
on
their
way
to
ithaca
they
had
not
sailed
past
a
hundred
leagues
before
the
breeze
which
circe
had
lent
them
suddenly
stopped
it
was
stricken
dead
all
the
sea
lay
in
prostrate
slumber
not
a
gasp
of
air
could
be
felt
the
ship
stood
still
ulysses
guessed
that
the
island
of
the
sirens
was
not
far
off
and
that
they
had
charmed
the
air
so
with
their
devilish
singing
therefore
he
made
him
cakes
of
wax
as
circe
had
instructed
him
and
stopped
the
ears
of
his
men
with
them
then
causing
himself
to
be
bound
hand
and
foot
he
commanded
the
rowers
to
ply
their
oars
and
row
as
fast
as
speed
could
carry
them
past
that
fatal
shore
they
soon
came
within
sight
of
the
sirens
who
sang
in
ulysses
hearing
come
here
thou
worthy
of
a
world
of
praise
that
dost
so
high
the
grecian
glory
raise
ulysses
stay
thy
ship
and
that
song
hear
that
none
pass
ever
but
it
bent
his
ear
but
left
him
ravish
and
instructed
more
by
us
than
any
ever
heard
before
for
we
know
all
things
whatsoever
were
in
wide
troy
labor
whatsoever
there
the
grecians
and
the
trojans
both
sustain
by
those
high
issues
that
the
gods
ordain
and
whatsoever
all
the
earth
can
show
to
inform
a
knowledge
of
desert
we
know
these
were
the
words
but
the
celestial
harmony
of
the
voices
which
sang
them
no
tongue
can
describe
it
took
the
ear
of
ulysses
with
ravishment
he
would
have
broken
his
bonds
to
rush
after
them
and
threatened
wept
sued
entreated
commanded
crying
out
with
tears
and
passionate
imprecations
conjuring
his
men
by
all
the
ties
of
perils
past
which
they
had
endured
in
common
by
fellowship
and
love
and
the
authority
which
he
retained
among
them
to
let
him
loose
but
at
no
rate
would
they
obey
him
and
still
the
sirens
sang
ulysses
made
signs
motions
gestures
promising
mountains
of
gold
if
they
would
set
him
free
but
their
oars
only
moved
faster
and
still
the
sirens
sang
and
still
the
more
he
adjured
them
to
set
him
free
the
faster
with
cords
and
ropes
they
bound
him
till
they
were
quite
out
of
hearing
of
the
sirens
notes
whose
effect
great
circe
had
so
truly
predicted
and
well
she
might
speak
of
them
for
often
she
has
joined
her
own
enchanting
voice
to
theirs
while
she
has
sat
in
the
flowery
meads
mingled
with
the
sirens
and
the
water
nymphs
gathering
their
potent
herbs
and
drugs
of
magic
quality
their
singing
altogether
has
made
the
gods
stoop
and
heaven
drowsy
with
the
harmony
illustration
would
have
broken
his
bonds
to
rush
after
escaped
that
peril
they
had
not
sailed
yet
a
hundred
leagues
farther
when
they
heard
a
roar
afar
off
which
ulysses
knew
to
be
the
barking
of
scylla
dogs
which
surround
her
waist
and
bark
incessantly
coming
nearer
they
beheld
a
smoke
ascend
with
a
horrid
murmur
which
arose
from
that
other
whirlpool
to
which
they
made
nigher
approaches
than
to
scylla
through
the
furious
eddy
which
is
in
that
place
the
ship
stood
still
as
a
stone
for
there
was
no
man
to
lend
his
hand
to
an
oar
the
dismal
roar
of
scylla
dogs
at
a
distance
and
the
nearer
clamours
of
charybdis
where
everything
made
an
echo
quite
taking
from
them
the
power
of
exertion
ulysses
went
up
and
down
encouraging
his
men
one
by
one
giving
them
good
words
telling
them
that
they
were
in
greater
perils
when
they
were
blocked
up
in
the
cyclop
cave
yet
heaven
assisting
his
counsels
he
had
delivered
them
out
of
that
extremity
that
he
could
not
believe
but
they
remembered
it
and
wished
them
to
give
the
same
trust
to
the
same
care
which
he
had
now
for
their
welfare
that
they
must
exert
all
the
strength
and
wit
which
they
had
and
try
if
jove
would
not
grant
them
an
escape
even
out
of
this
peril
in
particular
he
cheered
up
the
pilot
who
sat
at
the
helm
and
told
him
that
he
must
show
more
firmness
than
other
men
as
he
had
more
trust
committed
to
him
and
had
the
sole
management
by
his
skill
of
the
vessel
in
which
all
their
safeties
were
embarked
that
a
rock
lay
hid
within
those
boiling
whirlpools
which
he
saw
on
the
outside
of
which
he
must
steer
if
he
would
avoid
his
own
destruction
and
the
destruction
of
them
all
they
heard
him
and
like
men
took
to
the
oars
but
little
knew
what
opposite
danger
in
shunning
that
rock
they
must
be
thrown
upon
for
ulysses
had
concealed
from
them
the
wounds
never
to
be
healed
which
scylla
was
to
open
their
terror
would
else
have
robbed
them
all
of
all
care
to
steer
or
move
an
oar
and
have
made
them
hide
under
the
hatches
for
fear
of
seeing
her
where
he
and
they
must
have
died
an
idle
death
but
even
then
he
forgot
the
precautions
which
circe
had
given
him
to
prevent
harm
to
his
person
who
had
willed
him
not
to
arm
or
show
himself
once
to
scylla
but
disdaining
not
to
venture
life
for
his
brave
companions
he
could
not
contain
but
armed
in
all
points
and
taking
a
lance
in
either
hand
he
went
up
to
the
and
looked
when
scylla
would
appear
she
did
not
show
herself
as
yet
and
still
the
vessel
steered
closer
by
her
rock
as
it
sought
to
shun
that
other
more
dreaded
for
they
saw
how
horribly
charybdis
black
throat
drew
into
her
all
the
whirling
deep
which
she
disgorged
again
that
all
about
her
boiled
like
a
kettle
and
the
rock
roared
with
troubled
waters
which
when
she
supped
in
again
all
the
bottom
turned
up
and
disclosed
far
under
shore
the
swart
sands
naked
whose
whole
stern
sight
frayed
the
startled
blood
from
their
faces
and
made
ulysses
turn
to
view
the
wonder
of
whirlpools
which
when
scylla
saw
from
out
her
black
den
she
darted
out
her
six
long
necks
and
swooped
up
as
many
of
his
friends
whose
cries
ulysses
heard
and
saw
them
too
late
with
their
heels
turned
up
and
their
hands
thrown
to
him
for
succour
who
had
been
their
help
in
all
extremities
but
could
not
deliver
them
now
and
he
heard
them
shriek
out
as
she
tore
them
and
to
the
last
they
continued
to
throw
their
hands
out
to
him
for
sweet
life
in
all
his
sufferings
he
never
had
beheld
a
sight
so
full
of
miseries
escaped
from
scylla
and
charybdis
but
with
a
diminished
crew
ulysses
and
the
sad
remains
of
his
followers
reached
the
trinacrian
shore
here
landing
he
beheld
oxen
grazing
of
such
surpassing
size
and
beauty
that
both
from
them
and
from
the
shape
of
the
island
having
three
promontories
jutting
into
the
sea
he
judged
rightly
that
he
was
come
to
the
triangular
island
and
the
oxen
of
the
sun
of
which
tiresias
had
forewarned
him
so
great
was
his
terror
lest
through
his
own
fault
or
that
of
his
men
any
violence
or
profanation
should
be
offered
to
the
holy
oxen
that
even
then
tired
as
they
were
with
the
perils
and
fatigues
of
the
day
past
and
unable
to
stir
an
oar
or
use
any
exertion
and
though
night
was
fast
coming
on
he
would
have
had
them
immediately
and
make
the
best
of
their
way
from
that
dangerous
station
but
his
men
with
one
voice
resolutely
opposed
it
and
even
the
too
cautious
eurylochus
himself
withstood
the
proposal
so
much
did
the
temptation
of
a
little
ease
and
refreshment
ease
tenfold
sweet
after
such
labours
prevail
over
the
sagest
counsels
and
the
apprehension
of
certain
evil
outweigh
the
prospect
of
contingent
danger
they
expostulated
that
the
nerves
of
ulysses
seemed
to
be
made
of
steel
and
his
limbs
not
liable
to
lassitude
like
other
men
that
waking
or
sleeping
seemed
indifferent
to
him
but
that
they
were
men
not
gods
and
felt
the
common
appetites
for
food
and
sleep
that
in
the
all
the
winds
most
destructive
to
ships
are
generated
that
black
night
still
required
to
be
served
with
meat
and
sleep
and
quiet
havens
and
ease
that
the
best
sacrifice
to
the
sea
was
in
the
morning
with
such
sayings
and
mutinous
arguments
which
the
majority
have
always
ready
to
justify
disobedience
to
their
betters
they
forced
ulysses
to
comply
with
their
requisition
and
against
his
will
to
take
up
his
on
shore
but
he
first
exacted
from
them
an
oath
that
they
would
neither
maim
nor
kill
any
of
the
cattle
which
they
saw
grazing
but
content
themselves
with
such
food
as
circe
had
stowed
their
vessel
with
when
they
parted
from
aeaea
this
they
man
by
man
severally
promised
imprecating
the
heaviest
curses
on
whoever
should
break
it
and
mooring
their
bark
within
a
creek
they
went
to
supper
contenting
themselves
that
night
with
such
food
as
circe
had
given
them
not
without
many
sad
thoughts
of
their
friends
whom
scylla
had
devoured
the
grief
of
which
kept
them
great
part
of
the
night
waking
in
the
morning
ulysses
urged
them
again
to
a
religious
observance
of
the
oath
that
they
had
sworn
not
in
any
case
to
attempt
the
blood
of
those
fair
herds
which
they
saw
grazing
but
to
content
themselves
with
the
ship
food
for
the
god
who
owned
those
cattle
sees
and
hears
all
they
faithfully
obeyed
and
remained
in
that
good
mind
for
a
month
during
which
they
were
confined
to
that
station
by
contrary
winds
till
all
the
wine
and
the
bread
were
gone
which
they
had
brought
with
them
when
their
victuals
were
gone
necessity
compelled
them
to
stray
in
quest
of
whatever
fish
or
fowl
they
could
snare
which
that
coast
did
not
yield
in
any
great
abundance
then
ulysses
prayed
to
all
the
gods
that
dwelt
in
bountiful
heaven
that
they
would
be
pleased
to
yield
them
some
means
to
stay
their
hunger
without
having
recourse
to
profane
and
forbidden
violations
but
the
ears
of
heaven
seemed
to
be
shut
or
some
god
incensed
plotted
his
ruin
for
at
midday
when
he
should
chiefly
have
been
vigilant
and
watchful
to
prevent
mischief
a
deep
sleep
fell
upon
the
eyes
of
ulysses
during
which
he
lay
totally
insensible
of
all
that
passed
in
the
world
and
what
his
friends
or
what
his
enemies
might
do
for
his
welfare
or
destruction
then
eurylochus
took
his
advantage
he
was
the
man
of
most
authority
with
them
after
ulysses
he
represented
to
them
all
the
misery
of
their
condition
how
that
every
death
is
hateful
and
grievous
to
mortality
but
that
of
all
deaths
famine
is
attended
with
the
most
painful
loathsome
and
humiliating
circumstances
that
the
subsistence
which
they
could
hope
to
draw
from
fowling
or
fishing
was
too
precarious
to
be
depended
upon
that
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
chance
of
the
winds
changing
to
favour
their
escape
but
that
they
must
inevitably
stay
there
and
perish
if
they
let
an
irrational
superstition
deter
them
from
the
means
which
nature
offered
to
their
hands
that
ulysses
might
be
deceived
in
his
belief
that
these
oxen
had
any
sacred
qualities
above
other
oxen
and
even
admitting
that
they
were
the
property
of
the
god
of
the
sun
as
he
said
they
were
the
sun
did
neither
eat
nor
drink
and
the
gods
were
best
served
not
by
a
scrupulous
conscience
but
by
a
thankful
heart
which
took
freely
what
they
as
freely
offered
with
these
and
such
like
persuasions
he
prevailed
on
his
and
companions
to
begin
the
impious
violation
of
their
oath
by
the
slaughter
of
seven
of
the
fairest
of
these
oxen
which
were
grazing
part
they
roasted
and
eat
and
part
they
offered
in
sacrifice
to
the
gods
particularly
to
apollo
god
of
the
sun
vowing
to
build
a
temple
to
his
godhead
when
they
should
arrive
in
ithaca
and
deck
it
with
magnificent
and
numerous
gifts
vain
men
and
superstition
worse
than
that
which
they
so
lately
derided
to
imagine
that
prospective
penitence
can
excuse
a
present
violation
of
duty
and
that
the
pure
natures
of
the
heavenly
powers
will
admit
of
compromise
or
dispensation
for
sin
but
to
their
feast
they
fell
dividing
the
roasted
portions
of
the
flesh
savoury
and
pleasant
meat
to
them
but
a
sad
sight
to
the
eyes
and
a
savour
of
death
in
the
nostrils
of
the
waking
ulysses
who
just
woke
in
time
to
witness
but
not
soon
enough
to
prevent
their
rash
and
sacrilegious
banquet
he
had
scarce
time
to
ask
what
great
mischief
was
this
which
they
had
done
unto
him
when
behold
a
prodigy
the
which
they
had
stripped
began
to
creep
as
if
they
had
life
and
the
roasted
flesh
bellowed
as
the
ox
used
to
do
when
he
was
living
the
hair
of
ulysses
stood
up
on
end
with
affright
at
these
omens
but
his
companions
like
men
whom
the
gods
had
infatuated
to
their
destruction
persisted
in
their
horrible
banquet
the
sun
from
his
burning
chariot
saw
how
ulysses
men
had
slain
his
oxen
and
he
cried
to
his
father
jove
revenge
me
upon
these
impious
men
who
have
slain
my
oxen
which
it
did
me
good
to
look
upon
when
i
walked
my
heavenly
round
in
all
my
daily
course
i
never
saw
such
bright
and
beautiful
creatures
as
those
my
oxen
were
the
father
promised
that
ample
retribution
should
be
taken
of
those
accursed
men
which
was
fulfilled
shortly
after
when
they
took
their
leaves
of
the
fatal
island
six
days
they
feasted
in
spite
of
the
signs
of
heaven
and
on
the
seventh
the
wind
changing
they
set
their
sails
and
left
the
island
and
their
hearts
were
cheerful
with
the
banquets
they
had
held
all
but
the
heart
of
ulysses
which
sank
within
him
as
with
wet
eyes
he
beheld
his
friends
and
gave
them
for
lost
as
men
devoted
to
divine
vengeance
which
soon
overtook
them
for
they
had
not
gone
many
leagues
before
a
dreadful
tempest
arose
which
burst
their
cables
down
came
their
mast
crushing
the
skull
of
the
pilot
in
its
fall
off
he
fell
from
the
stern
into
the
water
and
the
bark
wanting
his
management
drove
along
at
the
mercy
thunders
roared
and
terrible
lightnings
of
jove
came
down
first
a
bolt
struck
eurylochus
then
another
and
then
another
till
all
the
crew
were
killed
and
their
bodies
swam
about
like
and
the
ship
was
split
in
pieces
only
ulysses
survived
and
he
had
no
hope
of
safety
but
in
tying
himself
to
the
mast
where
he
sat
riding
upon
the
waves
like
one
that
in
no
extremity
would
yield
to
fortune
nine
days
was
he
floating
about
with
all
the
motions
of
the
sea
with
no
other
support
than
the
slender
mast
under
him
till
the
tenth
night
cast
him
all
spent
and
weary
with
toil
upon
the
friendly
shores
of
the
island

was
he
floating
about

the
motions
of
the

four
the
island

immortality
refused
henceforth
the
adventures
of
the
single
ulysses

be
pursued

those
faithful
partakers
of
his
toil
who
with
him
left

laden
with
the
spoils
of
troy
now
not
one
remains
but
all
a
prey
to
the
remorseless
waves
and
food
for
some
great
fish
their
gallant
navy
reduced
to
one
ship
and
that
finally
swallowed
up
and
lost
where
now
are
all
their
anxious
thoughts
of
home
that
perseverance
with
which
they
went
through
the
severest
sufferings
and
the
hardest
labours
to
which
poor
seafarers
were
ever
exposed
that

at

crowned
with

mead
it
were
useless
to
describe
over
again
what
has
been
so
well
told
already
or
to
relate
those
soft
arts
of
courtship
which
the
goddess
used
to
detain
ulysses
the
same
in
kind
which
she
afterwards
practised
upon
his
less
wary
son
whom
minerva
in
the
shape
of
mentor
hardly
preserved
from
her
snares
when
they
came
to
the
delightful
island
together
in
search
of
the
scarce
departed
ulysses
a
memorable
example
of
married
love
and
a
worthy
instance
how
dear
to
every
good
man
his
country
is
was
exhibited
by
ulysses
if
circe
loved
him
sincerely
calypso
loves
him
with
tenfold
more
warmth
and
passion
she
can
deny
him
nothing
but
his
departure
she
offers
him
everything
even
to
a
participation
of
her
immortality
if
he
will
stay
and
share
in
her
pleasures
he
shall
never
die
but
death
with
glory
has
greater
charms
for
a
mind
heroic
than
a
life
that
shall
never
die
with
shame
and
when
he
pledged
his
vows
to
his
penelope
he
reserved
no
stipulation
that
he
would
forsake
her
whenever
a
goddess
should
think
him
worthy
of
her
bed
but
they
had
sworn
to
live
and
grow
old
together
and
he
would
not
survive
her
if
he
could
no
meanly
share
in
immortality
itself
from
which
she
was
excluded
these
thoughts
kept
him
pensive
and
melancholy
in
the
midst
of
pleasure
his
heart
was
on
the
seas
making
voyages
to
ithaca
twelve
months
had
worn
away
when
minerva
from
heaven
saw
her
favourite
how
he
sat
still
pining
on
the
seashores
his
daily
custom
wishing
for
a
ship
to
carry
him
home
she
who
is
wisdom
herself
was
indignant
that
so
wise
and
brave
a
man
as
ulysses
should
be
held
in
effeminate
bondage
by
an
unworthy
goddess
and
at
her
request
her
father
jove
ordered
mercury
to
go
down
to
the
earth
to
command
calypso
to
dismiss
her
guest
the
divine
messenger
tied
fast
to
his
feet
his
winged
shoes
which
bear
him
over
land
and
seas
and
took
in
his
hand
his
golden
rod
the
ensign
of
his
authority
then
wheeling
in
many
an
airy
round
he
stayed
not
till
he
alighted
on
the
firm
top
of
the
mountain
pieria
thence
he
fetched
a
second
circuit
over
the
seas
kissing
the
waves
in
his
flight
with
his
feet
as
light
as
any
fishing
dips
her
wings
till
he
touched
the
isle
ogygia
and
soared
up
from
the
blue
sea
to
the
grotto
of
the
goddess
to
whom
his
errand
was
ordained
his
message
struck
a
horror
checked
by
love
through
all
the
faculties
of
calypso
she
replied
to
it
incensed
you
gods
are
insatiate
past
all
that
live
in
all
things
which
you
affect
which
makes
you
so
envious
and
grudging
it
afflicts
you
to
the
heart
when
any
goddess
seeks
the
love
of
a
mortal
man
in
marriage
though
you
yourselves
without
scruple
link
yourselves
to
women
of
the
earth
so
it
fared
with
you
when
the
morning
shared
orion
bed
you
could
never
satisfy
your
hate
and
your
jealousy
till
you
had
incensed
the
dame
diana
who
leads
the
precise
life
to
come
upon
him
by
stealth
in
ortygia
and
pierce
him
through
with
her
arrows
and
when
ceres
gave
the
reins
to
her
affections
and
took
iasion
well
worthy
to
her
arms
the
secret
was
not
so
cunningly
kept
but
jove
had
soon
notice
of
it
and
the
poor
mortal
paid
for
his
felicity
with
death
struck
through
with
lightnings
and
now
you
envy
me
the
possession
of
a
wretched
man
whom
tempests
have
cast
upon
my
shores
making
him
lawfully
mine
whose
ship
jove
rent
in
pieces
with
his
hot
thunderbolts
killing
all
his
friends
him
i
have
preserved
loved
nourished
made
him
mine
by
protection
my
creature
by
every
tie
of
gratitude
mine
have
vowed
to
make
him
deathless
like
myself
him
you
will
take
from
me
but
i
know
your
power
and
that
it
is
vain
for
me
to
resist
tell
your
king
that
i
obey
his
mandates
with
an
ill
grace
calypso
promised
to
fulfil
the
commands
of
jove
and
mercury
departing
she
went
to
find
ulysses
where
he
sat
outside
the
grotto
not
knowing
of
the
heavenly
message
drowned
in
discontent
not
seeing
any
human
probability
of
his
ever
returning
home
she
said
to
him
unhappy
man
no
longer
afflict
yourself
with
pining
after
your
country
but
build
you
a
ship
with
which
you
may
return
home
since
it
is
the
will
of
the
gods
who
doubtless
as
they
are
greater
in
power
than
i
are
greater
in
skill
and
best
can
tell
what
is
fittest
for
man
but
i
call
the
gods
and
my
inward
conscience
to
witness
that
i
have
no
thought
but
what
stood
with
thy
safety
nor
would
have
done
or
counselled
anything
against
thy
good
i
persuaded
thee
to
nothing
which
i
should
not
have
followed
myself
in
thy
extremity
for
my
mind
is
innocent
and
simple
o
if
thou
knewest
what
dreadful
sufferings
thou
must
yet
endure
before
ever
thou
reachest
thy
native
land
thou
wouldest
not
esteem
so
hardly
of
a
goddess
offer
to
share
her
immortality
with
thee
nor
for
a
few
years
enjoyment
of
a
perishing
penelope
refuse
an
imperishable
and
life
with
calypso
he
replied
great
calypso
let
it
not
displease
thee
that
i
a
mortal
man
desire
to
see
and
converse
again
with
a
wife
that
is
mortal
human
objects
are
best
fitted
to
human
infirmities
i
well
know
how
far
in
wisdom
in
feature
in
stature
proportion
beauty
in
all
the
gifts
of
the
mind
thou
exceedest
my
penelope
she
is
a
mortal
and
subject
to
decay
thou
immortal
ever
growing
yet
never
old
yet
in
her
sight
all
my
desires
terminate
all
my
wishes
in
the
sight
of
her
and
of
my
country
earth
if
any
god
envious
of
my
return
shall
lay
his
dreadful
hand
upon
me
as
i
pass
the
seas
i
submit
for
the
same
powers
have
given
me
a
mind
not
to
sink
under
oppression
in
wars
and
waves
my
sufferings
have
not
been
small
she
heard
his
pleaded
reasons
and
of
force
she
must
assent
so
to
her
nymphs
she
gave
in
charge
from
her
sacred
woods
to
cut
down
timber
to
make
ulysses
a
ship
they
obeyed
though
in
a
work
unsuitable
to
their
soft
fingers
yet
to
obedience
no
sacrifice
is
hard
and
ulysses
busily
bestirred
himself
labouring
far
more
hard
than
they
as
was
fitting
till
twenty
tall
trees
driest
and
fittest
for
timber
were
felled
then
like
a
skilful
shipwright
he
fell
to
joining
the
planks
using
the
plane
the
axe
and
the
auger
with
such
expedition
that
in
four
days
time
a
ship
was
made
complete
with
all
her
decks
hatches
sideboards
yards
calypso
added
linen
for
the
sails
and
tackling
and
when
she
was
finished
she
was
a
goodly
vessel
for
a
man
to
sail
in
alone
or
in
company
over
the
wide
seas
by
the
fifth
morning
she
was
launched
and
ulysses
furnished
with
store
of
provisions
rich
garments
and
gold
and
silver
given
him
by
calypso
took
a
last
leave
of
her
and
of
her
nymphs
and
of
the
isle
ogygia
which
had
so
befriended
him
illustration
a
last
leave
of
her
and
of
her
chapter
five
the
the
the
escape
by
the
sleep
in
the
woods
at
the
stern
of
his
solitary
ship
ulysses
sat
and
steered
right
artfully
no
sleep
could
seize
his
eyelids
he
beheld
the
pleiads
the
bear
which
is
by
some
called
the
wain
that
moves
round
about
orion
and
keeps
still
above
the
ocean
and
the
sign
bootes
which
some
name
the
wagoner
seventeen
days
he
held
his
course
and
on
the
eighteenth
the
coast
of
phaeacia
was
in
sight
the
figure
of
the
land
as
seen
from
the
sea
was
pretty
and
circular
and
looked
something
like
a
shield
neptune
returning
from
visiting
his
favourite
aethiopians
from
the
mountains
of
the
solymi
descried
ulysses
ploughing
the
waves
his
domain
the
sight
of
the
man
he
so
much
hated
for
polyphemus
sake
his
son
whose
eye
ulysses
had
put
out
set
the
god
heart
on
fire
and
snatching
into
his
hand
his
horrid
the
trident
of
his
power
he
smote
the
air
and
the
sea
and
conjured
up
all
his
black
storms
calling
down
night
from
the
cope
of
heaven
and
taking
the
earth
into
the
sea
as
it
seemed
with
clouds
through
the
darkness
and
indistinctness
which
prevailed
the
billows
rolling
up
before
the
fury
of
all
the
winds
that
contended
together
in
their
mighty
sport
then
the
knees
of
ulysses
bent
with
fear
and
then
all
his
spirit
was
spent
and
he
wished
that
he
had
been
among
the
number
of
his
countrymen
who
fell
before
troy
and
had
their
funerals
celebrated
by
all
the
greeks
rather
than
to
perish
thus
where
no
man
could
mourn
him
or
know
him
as
he
thought
these
melancholy
thoughts
a
huge
wave
took
him
and
washed
him
overboard
ship
and
all
upset
amidst
the
billows
he
struggling
afar
off
clinging
to
her
stern
broken
off
which
he
yet
held
her
mast
cracking
in
two
with
the
fury
of
that
gust
of
mixed
winds
that
struck
it
sails
and
sailyards
fell
into
the
deep
and
he
himself
was
long
drowned
under
water
nor
could
get
his
head
above
wave
so
met
with
wave
as
if
they
strove
which
should
depress
him
most
and
the
gorgeous
garments
given
him
by
calypso
clung
about
him
and
hindered
his
swimming
yet
neither
for
this
nor
for
the
overthrow
of
his
ship
nor
his
own
perilous
condition
would
he
give
up
his
drenched
vessel
but
wrestling
with
neptune
got
at
length
hold
of
her
again
and
then
sat
in
her
hull
insulting
over
death
which
he
had
escaped
and
the
salt
waves
which
he
gave
the
seas
again
to
give
to
other
men
his
ship
striving
to
live
floated
at
random
cuffed
from
wave
to
wave
hurled
to
and
fro
by
all
the
winds
now
boreas
tossed
it
to
notus
notus
passed
it
to
eurus
and
eurus
to
the
west
wind
who
kept
up
the
horrid
tennis
them
in
their
mad
sport
ino
leucothea
beheld
ino
leucothea
now
a
but
once
a
mortal
and
the
daughter
of
cadmus
she
with
pity
beheld
ulysses
the
mark
of
their
fierce
contention
and
rising
from
the
waves
alighted
on
the
ship
in
shape
like
to
the
which
is
called
a
cormorant
and
in
her
beak
she
held
a
wonderful
girdle
made
of
which
grow
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
which
she
dropped
at
his
feet
and
the
bird
spake
to
ulysses
and
counselled
him
not
to
trust
any
more
to
that
fatal
vessel
against
which
god
neptune
had
levelled
his
furious
wrath
nor
to
those
garments
which
calypso
had
given
him
but
to
quit
both
it
and
them
and
trust
for
his
safety
to
swimming
and
here
said
the
seeming
bird
take
this
girdle
and
tie
about
your
middle
which
has
virtue
to
protect
the
wearer
at
sea
and
you
shall
safely
reach
the
shore
but
when
you
have
landed
cast
it
far
from
you
back
into
the
sea
he
did
as
the
instructed
him
he
stripped
himself
naked
and
fastening
the
wondrous
girdle
about
his
middle
cast
himself
into
the
seas
to
swim
the
bird
dived
past
his
sight
into
the
fathomless
abyss
of
the
ocean
two
days
and
two
nights
he
spent
in
struggling
with
the
waves
though
sore
buffeted
and
almost
spent
never
giving
up
himself
for
lost
such
confidence
he
had
in
that
charm
which
he
wore
about
his
middle
and
in
the
words
of
that
divine
bird
but
the
third
morning
the
winds
grew
calm
and
all
the
heavens
were
clear
then
he
saw
himself
nigh
land
which
he
knew
to
be
the
coast
of
the
phaeacians
a
people
good
to
strangers
and
abounding
in
ships
by
whose
favour
he
doubted
not
that
he
should
soon
obtain
a
passage
to
his
own
country
and
such
joy
he
conceived
in
his
heart
as
good
sons
have
that
esteem
their
father
life
dear
when
long
sickness
has
held
him
down
to
his
bed
and
wasted
his
body
and
they
see
at
length
health
return
to
the
old
man
with
restored
strength
and
spirits
in
reward
of
their
many
prayers
to
the
gods
for
his
safety
so
precious
was
the
prospect
of
to
ulysses
that
he
might
restore
health
to
his
country
his
better
parent
that
had
long
languished
as
full
of
distempers
in
his
absence
and
then
for
his
own
safety
sake
he
had
joy
to
see
the
shores
the
woods
so
nigh
and
within
his
grasp
as
they
seemed
and
he
laboured
with
all
the
might
of
hands
and
feet
to
reach
with
swimming
that
land
but
when
he
approached
near
a
horrid
sound
of
a
huge
sea
beating
against
rocks
informed
him
that
here
was
no
place
for
landing
nor
any
harbour
for
man
resort
but
through
the
weeds
and
the
foam
which
the
sea
belched
up
against
the
land
he
could
dimly
discover
the
rugged
shore
all
bristled
with
flints
and
all
that
part
of
the
coast
one
impending
rock
that
seemed
impossible
to
climb
and
the
water
all
about
so
deep
that
not
a
sand
was
there
for
any
tired
foot
to
rest
upon
and
every
moment
he
feared
lest
some
wave
more
cruel
than
the
rest
should
crush
him
against
a
cliff
rendering
worse
than
vain
all
his
landing
and
should
he
swim
to
seek
a
more
commodious
haven
farther
on
he
was
fearful
lest
weak
and
spent
as
he
was
the
winds
would
force
him
back
a
long
way
off
into
the
main
where
the
terrible
god
neptune
for
wrath
that
he
had
so
nearly
escaped
his
power
having
gotten
him
again
into
his
domain
would
send
out
some
great
whale
of
which
those
seas
breed
a
horrid
number
to
swallow
him
up
alive
with
such
malignity
he
still
pursued
him
while
these
thoughts
distracted
him
with
diversity
of
dangers
one
bigger
wave
drove
against
a
sharp
rock
his
naked
body
which
it
gashed
and
tore
and
wanted
little
of
breaking
all
his
bones
so
rude
was
the
shock
but
in
this
extremity
she
prompted
him
that
never
failed
him
at
need
minerva
who
is
wisdom
itself
put
it
into
his
thoughts
no
longer
to
keep
swimming
off
and
on
as
one
dallying
with
danger
but
boldly
to
force
the
shore
that
threatened
him
and
to
hug
the
rock
that
had
torn
him
so
rudely
which
with
both
hands
he
clasped
wrestling
with
extremity
till
the
rage
of
that
billow
which
had
driven
him
upon
it
was
passed
but
then
again
the
rock
drove
back
that
wave
so
furiously
that
it
reft
him
of
his
hold
sucking
him
with
it
in
its
return
and
the
sharp
rock
his
cruel
friend
to
which
he
clung
for
succour
rent
the
flesh
so
sore
from
his
hands
in
parting
that
he
fell
off
and
could
sustain
no
longer
quite
under
water
he
fell
and
past
the
help
of
fate
there
had
the
hapless
ulysses
lost
all
portion
that
he
had
in
this
life
if
minerva
had
not
prompted
his
wisdom
in
that
peril
to
essay
another
course
and
to
explore
some
other
shelter
ceasing
to
attempt
that
she
guided
his
wearied
and
limbs
to
the
mouth
of
the
fair
river
callicoe
which
not
far
from
thence
disbursed
its
watery
tribute
to
the
ocean
here
the
shores
were
easy
and
accessible
and
the
rocks
which
rather
adorned
than
defended
its
banks
so
smooth
that
they
seemed
polished
of
purpose
to
invite
the
landing
of
our
and
to
atone
for
the
uncourteous
treatment
which
those
less
hospitable
cliffs
had
afforded
him
and
the
god
of
the
river
as
if
in
pity
stayed
his
current
and
smoothed
his
waters
to
make
his
landing
more
easy
for
sacred
to
the
deities
of
the
fresh
waters
be
they
river
or
lake
is
the
cry
of
erring
mortals
that
seek
their
aid
by
reason
that
being
they
partake
more
of
the
gentle
humanities
of
our
nature
than
those
marine
deities
whom
neptune
trains
up
in
tempests
in
the
unpitying
recesses
of
his
salt
abyss
so
by
the
favour
of
the
river
god
ulysses
crept
to
land
both
his
knees
faltering
his
strong
hands
falling
down
through
weakness
from
the
excessive
toils
he
had
endured
his
cheeks
and
nostrils
flowing
with
froth
of
the
much
of
which
he
had
swallowed
in
that
conflict
voice
and
breath
spent
down
he
sank
as
in
death
dead
weary
he
was
it
seemed
that
the
sea
had
soaked
through
his
heart
and
the
pains
he
felt
in
all
his
veins
were
little
less
than
those
which
one
feels
that
has
endured
the
torture
of
the
rack
but
when
his
spirits
came
a
little
to
themselves
and
his
recollection
by
degrees
began
to
return
he
rose
up
and
unloosing
from
his
waist
the
girdle
or
charm
which
that
divine
bird
had
given
him
and
remembering
the
charge
which
he
had
received
with
it
he
flung
it
far
from
him
into
the
river
back
it
swam
with
the
course
of
the
ebbing
stream
till
it
reached
the
sea
where
the
fair
hands
of
ino
leucothea
received
it
to
keep
it
as
a
pledge
of
safety
to
any
future
shipwrecked
mariner
that
like
ulysses
should
wander
in
those
perilous
waves
then
he
kissed
the
humble
earth
in
token
of
safety
and
on
he
went
by
the
side
of
that
pleasant
river
till
he
came
where
a
thicker
shade
of
rushes
that
grew
on
its
banks
seemed
to
point
out
the
place
where
he
might
rest
his
limbs
and
here
a
fresh
perplexity
divided
his
mind
whether
he
should
pass
the
night
which
was
coming
on
in
that
place
where
though
he
feared
no
other
enemies
the
damps
and
frosts
of
the
chill
in
that
exposed
situation
might
be
death
to
him
in
his
weak
state
or
whether
he
had
better
climb
the
next
hill
and
pierce
the
depth
of
some
shady
wood
in
which
he
might
find
a
warm
and
sheltered
though
insecure
repose
subject
to
the
approach
of
any
wild
beast
that
roamed
that
way
best
did
this
last
course
appear
to
him
though
with
some
danger
as
that
which
was
more
honourable
and
savoured
more
of
strife
and
than
to
perish
without
a
struggle
the
passive
victim
of
cold
and
the
elements
so
he
bent
his
course
to
the
nearest
woods
where
entering
in
he
found
a
thicket
mostly
of
wild
olives
and
such
low
trees
yet
growing
so
intertwined
and
knit
together
that
the
moist
wind
had
not
leave
to
play
through
their
branches
nor
the
sun
scorching
beams
to
pierce
their
recesses
nor
any
shower
to
beat
through
they
grew
so
thick
and
as
it
were
folded
each
in
the
other
here
creeping
in
he
made
his
bed
of
the
leaves
which
were
beginning
to
fall
of
which
was
such
abundance
that
two
or
three
men
might
have
spread
them
ample
coverings
such
as
might
shield
them
from
the
winter
rage
though
the
air
breathed
steel
and
blew
as
it
would
burst
here
creeping
in
he
heaped
up
store
of
leaves
all
about
him
as
a
man
would
billets
upon
a
winter
fire
and
lay
down
in
the
midst
rich
seed
of
virtue
lying
hid
in
poor
leaves
here
minerva
soon
gave
him
sound
sleep
and
here
all
his
long
toils
past
seemed
to
be
concluded
and
shut
up
within
the
little
sphere
of
his
refreshed
and
closed
eyelids
chapter

the

the

with
the
the
court
of
phaeacia
and
king
alcinous
meantime
minerva
designing
an
interview
between
the
king
daughter
of
that
country
and
ulysses
when
he
should
awake
went
by
night
to
the
palace
of
king
alcinous
and
stood
at
the
bedside
of
the
princess
nausicaa
in
the
shape
of
one
of
her
favourite
attendants
and
thus
addressed
the
sleeping
princess
nausicaa
why
do
you
lie
sleeping
here
and
never
bestow
a
thought
upon
your
bridal
ornaments
of
which
you
have
many
and
beautiful
laid
up
in
your
wardrobe
against
the
day
of
your
marriage
which
can
not
be
far
distant
when
you
shall
have
need
of
all
not
only
to
deck
your
own
person
but
to
give
away
in
presents
to
the
virgins
that
honouring
you
shall
attend
you
to
the
temple
your
reputation
stands
much
upon
the
timely
care
of
these
things
these
things
are
they
which
fill
father
and
reverend
mother
with
delight
let
us
arise
betimes
to
wash
your
fair
vestments
of
linen
and
silks
in
the
river
and
request
your
sire
to
lend
you
mules
and
a
coach
for
your
wardrobe
is
heavy
and
the
place
where
we
must
wash
is
distant
and
besides
it
fits
not
a
great
princess
like
you
to
go
so
far
on
foot
so
saying
she
went
away
and
nausicaa
awoke
full
of
pleasing
thoughts
of
her
marriage
which
the
dream
had
told
her
was
not
far
distant
and
as
soon
as
it
was
dawn
she
arose
and
dressed
herself
and
went
to
find
her
parents
the
queen
her
mother
was
already
up
and
seated
among
her
maids
spinning
at
her
wheel
as
the
fashion
was
in
those
primitive
times
when
great
ladies
did
not
disdain
housewifery
and
the
king
her
father
was
preparing
to
go
abroad
at
that
early
hour
to
council
with
his
grave
senate
my
father
she
said
will
you
not
order
mules
and
a
coach
to
be
got
ready
that
i
may
go
and
wash
i
and
my
maids
at
the
cisterns
that
stand
without
the
city
what
washing
does
my
daughter
speak
of
said
alcinous
mine
and
my
brothers
garments
she
replied
that
have
contracted
soil
by
this
time
with
lying
by
so
long
in
the
wardrobe
five
sons
have
you
that
are
my
brothers
two
of
them
are
married
and
three
are
bachelors
these
last
it
concerns
to
have
their
garments
neat
and
unsoiled
it
may
advance
their
fortunes
in
marriage
and
who
but
i
their
sister
should
have
a
care
of
these
things
you
yourself
my
father
have
need
of
the
whitest
apparel
when
you
go
as
now
to
the
council
she
used
this
plea
modestly
dissembling
her
care
of
her
own
nuptials
to
her
father
who
was
not
displeased
at
this
instance
of
his
discretion
for
a
seasonable
care
about
marriage
may
be
permitted
to
a
young
maiden
provided
it
be
accompanied
with
modesty
and
dutiful
submission
to
her
parents
in
the
choice
of
her
future
husband
and
there
was
no
fear
of
nausicaa
choosing
wrongly
or
improperly
for
she
was
as
wise
as
she
was
beautiful
and
the
best
in
all
phaeacia
were
suitors
to
her
for
her
love
so
alcinous
readily
gave
consent
that
she
should
go
ordering
mules
and
a
coach
to
be
prepared
and
nausicaa
brought
from
her
chamber
all
her
vestments
and
laid
them
up
in
the
coach
and
her
mother
placed
bread
and
wine
in
the
coach
and
oil
in
a
golden
cruse
to
soften
the
bright
skins
of
nausicaa
and
her
maids
when
they
came
out
of
the
river
nausicaa
making
her
maids
get
up
into
the
coach
with
her
lashed
the
mules
till
they
brought
her
to
the
cisterns
which
stood
a
little
on
the
outside
of
the
town
and
were
supplied
with
water
from
the
river
callicoe
there
her
attendants
unyoked
the
mules
took
out
the
clothes
and
steeped
them
in
the
cisterns
washing
them
in
several
waters
and
afterwards
treading
them
clean
with
their
feet
venturing
wagers
who
should
have
done
soonest
and
cleanest
and
using
many
pretty
pastimes
to
beguile
their
labours
as
young
maids
use
while
the
princess
looked
on
when
they
had
laid
their
clothes
to
dry
they
fell
to
playing
again
and
nausicaa
joined
them
in
a
game
with
the
ball
which
is
used
in
that
country
which
is
performed
by
tossing
the
ball
from
hand
to
hand
with
great
expedition
she
who
begins
the
pastime
singing
a
song
it
chanced
that
the
princess
whose
turn
it
became
to
toss
the
ball
sent
it
so
far
from
its
mark
that
it
fell
beyond
into
one
of
the
cisterns
of
the
river
at
which
the
whole
company
in
merry
consternation
set
up
a
shriek
so
loud
as
waked
the
sleeping
ulysses
who
was
taking
his
rest
after
his
long
toils
in
the
woods
not
far
distant
from
the
place
where
these
young
maids
had
come
to
illustration
nausicaa
joined
them
in
a
game
with
the
at
the
sound
of
female
voices
ulysses
crept
forth
from
his
retirement
making
himself
a
covering
with
boughs
and
leaves
as
well
as
he
could
to
shroud
his
nakedness
the
sudden
appearance
of
his
and
almost
naked
form
so
frighted
the
maidens
that
they
scudded
away
into
the
woods
and
all
about
to
hide
themselves
only
minerva
who
had
brought
about
this
interview
to
admirable
purposes
by
seemingly
accidental
means
put
courage
into
the
breast
of
nausicaa
and
she
stayed
where
she
was
and
resolved
to
know
what
manner
of
man
he
was
and
what
was
the
occasion
of
his
strange
coming
to
them
he
not
venturing
for
delicacy
to
approach
and
clasp
her
knees
as
suppliants
should
but
standing
far
off
addressed
this
speech
to
the
young
princess
before
i
presume
rudely
to
press
my
petitions
i
should
first
ask
whether
i
am
addressing
a
mortal
woman
or
one
of
the
goddesses
if
a
goddess
you
seem
to
me
to
be
likest
to
diana
the
chaste
huntress
the
daughter
of
jove
like
hers
are
your
lineaments
your
stature
your
features
and
air
divine
she
making
answer
that
she
was
no
goddess
but
a
mortal
maid
he
continued
if
a
woman
thrice
blessed
are
both
the
authors
of
your
birth
thrice
blessed
are
your
brothers
who
even
to
rapture
must
have
joy
in
your
perfections
to
see
you
grown
so
like
a
young
tree
and
so
graceful
but
most
blessed
of
all
that
breathe
is
he
that
has
the
gift
to
engage
your
young
neck
in
the
yoke
of
marriage
i
never
saw
that
man
that
was
worthy
of
you
i
never
saw
man
or
woman
that
at
all
parts
equalled
you
lately
at
delos
where
i
touched
i
saw
a
young
palm
which
grew
beside
temple
it
exceeded
all
the
trees
which
ever
i
beheld
for
straightness
and
beauty
i
can
compare
you
only
to
that
a
stupor
past
admiration
strikes
me
joined
with
fear
which
keeps
me
back
from
approaching
you
to
embrace
your
knees
nor
is
it
strange
for
one
of
freshest
and
firmest
spirit
would
falter
approaching
near
to
so
bright
an
object
but
i
am
one
whom
a
cruel
habit
of
calamity
has
prepared
to
receive
strong
impressions
twenty
days
the
unrelenting
seas
have
tossed
me
up
and
down
coming
from
ogygia
and
at
length
cast
me
shipwrecked
last
night
upon
your
coast
i
have
seen
no
man
or
woman
since
i
landed
but
yourself
all
that
i
crave
is
clothes
which
you
may
spare
me
and
to
be
shown
the
way
to
some
neighbouring
town
the
gods
who
have
care
of
strangers
will
requite
you
for
these
courtesies
she
admiring
to
hear
such
complimentary
words
proceed
out
of
the
mouth
of
one
whose
outside
looked
so
rough
and
unpromising
made
answer
stranger
i
discern
neither
sloth
nor
folly
in
you
and
yet
i
see
that
you
are
poor
and
wretched
from
which
i
gather
that
neither
wisdom
nor
industry
can
secure
felicity
only
jove
bestows
it
upon
whomsoever
he
pleases
he
perhaps
has
reduced
you
to
this
plight
however
since
your
wanderings
have
brought
you
so
near
to
our
city
it
lies
in
our
duty
to
supply
your
wants
clothes
and
what
else
a
human
hand
should
give
to
one
so
suppliant
and
so
tamed
with
calamity
you
shall
not
want
we
will
show
you
our
city
and
tell
you
the
name
of
our
people
this
is
the
land
of
the
phaeacians
of
which
my
father
alcinous
is
king
then
calling
her
attendants
who
had
dispersed
on
the
first
sight
of
ulysses
she
rebuked
them
for
their
fear
and
said
this
man
is
no
cyclop
nor
monster
of
sea
or
land
that
you
should
fear
him
but
he
seems
manly
staid
and
discreet
and
though
decayed
in
his
outward
appearance
yet
he
has
the
mind
riches
wit
and
fortitude
in
abundance
show
him
the
cisterns
where
he
may
wash
him
from
the
and
foam
that
hang
about
him
and
let
him
have
garments
that
fit
him
out
of
those
which
we
have
brought
with
us
to
the
cisterns
ulysses
retiring
a
little
out
of
sight
cleansed
him
in
the
cisterns
from
the
soil
and
impurities
with
which
the
rocks
and
waves
had
covered
all
his
body
and
clothing
himself
with
befitting
raiment
which
the
attendants
had
given
him
he
presented
himself
in
more
worthy
shape
to
nausicaa
she
admired
to
see
what
a
comely
personage
he
was
now
he
was
dressed
in
all
parts
she
thought
him
some
king
or
hero
and
secretly
wished
that
the
gods
would
be
pleased
to
give
her
such
a
husband
then
causing
her
attendants
to
yoke
her
mules
and
lay
up
the
vestments
which
the
sun
heat
had
sufficiently
dried
in
the
coach
she
ascended
with
her
maids
and
drove
off
to
the
palace
bidding
ulysses
as
she
departed
keep
an
eye
upon
the
coach
and
to
follow
it
on
foot
at
some
distance
which
she
did
because
if
she
had
suffered
him
to
have
rode
in
the
coach
with
her
it
might
have
subjected
her
to
some
misconstructions
of
the
common
people
who
are
always
ready
to
vilify
and
censure
their
betters
and
to
suspect
that
charity
is
not
always
pure
charity
but
that
love
or
some
sinister
intention
lies
hid
under
its
disguise
so
discreet
and
attentive
to
appearance
in
all
her
actions
was
this
admirable
princess
ulysses
as
he
entered
the
city
wondered
to
see
its
magnificence
its
markets
buildings
temples
its
walls
and
rampires
its
trade
and
resort
of
men
its
harbours
for
shipping
which
is
the
strength
of
the
phaeacian
state
but
when
he
approached
the
palace
and
beheld
its
riches
the
proportion
of
its
architecture
its
avenues
gardens
statues
fountains
he
stood
rapt
in
admiration
and
almost
forgot
his
own
condition
in
surveying
the
flourishing
estate
of
others
but
recollecting
himself
he
passed
on
boldly
into
the
inner
apartment
where
the
king
and
queen
were
sitting
at
dinner
with
their
peers
nausicaa
having
prepared
them
for
his
approach
to
them
humbly
kneeling
he
made
it
his
request
that
since
fortune
had
cast
him
naked
upon
their
shores
they
would
take
him
into
their
protection
and
grant
him
a
conveyance
by
one
of
the
ships
of
which
their
great
phaeacian
state
had
such
good
store
to
carry
him
to
his
own
country
having
delivered
his
request
to
grace
it
with
more
humility
he
went
and
sat
himself
down
upon
the
hearth
among
the
ashes
as
the
custom
was
in
those
days
when
any
would
make
a
petition
to
the
throne
he
seemed
a
petitioner
of
so
great
state
and
of
so
superior
a
deportment
that
alcinous
himself
arose
to
do
him
honour
and
causing
him
to
leave
that
abject
station
which
he
had
assumed
placed
him
next
to
his
throne
upon
a
chair
of
state
and
thus
he
spake
to
his
peers
lords
and
councillors
of
phaeacia
ye
see
this
man
who
he
is
we
know
not
that
is
come
to
us
in
the
guise
of
a
petitioner
he
seems
no
mean
one
but
whoever
he
is
it
is
fit
since
the
gods
have
cast
him
upon
our
protection
that
we
grant
him
the
rites
of
hospitality
while
he
stays
with
us
and
at
his
departure
a
ship
well
manned
to
convey
so
worthy
a
personage
as
he
seems
to
be
in
a
manner
suitable
to
his
rank
to
his
own
country
this
counsel
the
peers
with
one
consent
approved
and
wine
and
meat
being
set
before
ulysses
he
ate
and
drank
and
gave
the
gods
thanks
who
had
stirred
up
the
royal
bounty
of
alcinous
to
aid
him
in
that
extremity
but
not
as
yet
did
he
reveal
to
the
king
and
queen
who
he
was
or
whence
he
had
come
only
in
brief
terms
he
related
his
being
cast
upon
their
shores
his
sleep
in
the
woods
and
his
meeting
with
the
princess
nausicaa
whose
generosity
mingled
with
discretion
filled
her
parents
with
delight
as
ulysses
in
eloquent
phrases
adorned
and
commended
her
virtues
but
alcinous
humanely
considering
that
the
troubles
which
his
guest
had
undergone
required
rest
as
well
as
refreshment
by
food
dismissed
him
early
in
the
evening
to
his
chamber
where
in
a
magnificent
apartment
ulysses
found
a
smoother
bed
but
not
a
sounder
repose
than
he
had
enjoyed
the
night
before
sleeping
upon
leaves
which
he
had
scraped
together
in
his
necessity
chapter
seven
the
songs
of
the
convoy
the
mariners
transformed
to
the
young
shepherd
when
it
was
daylight
alcinous
caused
it
to
be
proclaimed
by
the
heralds
about
the
town
that
there
was
come
to
the
palace
a
stranger
shipwrecked
on
their
coast
that
in
mien
and
person
resembled
a
god
and
inviting
all
the
chief
people
of
the
city
to
come
and
do
honour
to
the
stranger
the
palace
was
quickly
filled
with
guests
old
and
young
for
whose
cheer
and
to
grace
ulysses
more
alcinous
made
a
kingly
feast
with
banquetings
and
music
then
ulysses
being
seated
at
a
table
next
the
king
and
queen
in
all
men
view
after
they
had
feasted
alcinous
ordered
demodocus
the
to
be
called
to
sing
some
song
of
the
deeds
of
heroes
to
charm
the
ear
of
his
guest
demodocus
came
and
reached
his
harp
where
it
hung
between
two
pillars
of
silver
and
then
the
blind
singer
to
whom
in
recompense
of
his
lost
sight
the
muses
had
given
an
inward
discernment
a
soul
and
a
voice
to
excite
the
hearts
of
men
and
gods
to
delight
began
in
grave
and
solemn
strains
to
sing
the
glories
of
men
highliest
famed
he
chose
a
poem
whose
subject
was
the
stern
strife
stirred
up
between
ulysses
and
great
achilles
as
at
a
banquet
sacred
to
the
gods
in
dreadful
language
they
expressed
their
difference
while
agamemnon
sat
rejoiced
in
soul
to
hear
those
grecians
jar
for
the
oracle
in
pytho
had
told
him
that
the
period
of
their
wars
in
troy
should
then
be
when
the
kings
of
greece
anxious
to
arrive
at
the
wished
conclusion
should
fall
to
strife
and
contend
which
must
end
the
war
force
or
stratagem
this
brave
contention
he
expressed
so
to
the
life
in
the
very
words
which
they
both
used
in
the
quarrel
as
brought
tears
into
the
eyes
of
ulysses
at
the
remembrance
of
past
passages
of
his
life
and
he
held
his
large
purple
weed
before
his
face
to
conceal
it
then
craving
a
cup
of
wine
he
poured
it
out
in
secret
libation
to
the
gods
who
had
put
into
the
mind
of
demodocus
unknowingly
to
do
him
so
much
honour
but
when
the
moving
poet
began
to
tell
of
other
occurrences
where
ulysses
had
been
present
the
memory
of
his
brave
followers
who
had
been
with
him
in
all
difficulties
now
swallowed
up
and
lost
in
the
ocean
and
of
those
kings
that
had
fought
with
him
at
troy
some
of
whom
were
dead
some
exiles
like
himself
forced
itself
so
strongly
upon
his
mind
that
forgetful
where
he
was
he
sobbed
outright
with
passion
which
yet
he
restrained
but
not
so
cunningly
but
alcinous
perceived
it
and
without
taking
notice
of
it
to
ulysses
privately
gave
signs
that
demodocus
should
cease
from
his
singing
next
followed
dancing
in
the
phaeacian
fashion
when
they
would
show
respect
to
their
guests
which
was
succeeded
by
trials
of
skill
games
of
strength
running
racing
hurling
of
the
quoit
mock
fights
hurling
of
the
javelin
shooting
with
the
bow
in
some
of
which
ulysses
modestly
challenging
his
entertainers
performed
such
feats
of
strength
and
prowess
as
gave
the
admiring
phaeacians
fresh
reason
to
imagine
that
he
was
either
some
god
or
hero
of
the
race
of
the
gods
these
solemn
shows
and
pageants
in
honour
of
his
guest
king
alcinous
continued
for
the
space
of
many
days
as
if
he
could
never
be
weary
of
showing
courtesies
to
so
worthy
a
stranger
in
all
this
time
he
never
asked
him
his
name
nor
sought
to
know
more
of
him
than
he
of
his
own
accord
disclosed
till
on
a
day
as
they
were
seated
feasting
after
the
feast
was
ended
demodocus
being
called
as
was
the
custom
to
sing
some
grave
matter
sang
how
ulysses
on
that
night
when
troy
was
fired
made
dreadful
proof
of
his
valour
maintaining
singly
a
combat
against
the
whole
household
of
deiphobus
to
which
the
divine
expresser
gave
both
act
and
passion
and
breathed
such
a
fire
into
ulysses
deeds
that
it
inspired
old
death
with
life
in
the
lively
expressing
of
slaughters
and
rendered
life
so
sweet
and
passionate
in
the
hearers
that
all
who
heard
felt
it
fleet
from
them
in
the
narration
which
made
ulysses
even
pity
his
own
slaughterous
deeds
and
feel
touches
of
remorse
to
see
how
song
can
revive
a
dead
man
from
the
grave
yet
no
way
can
it
defend
a
living
man
from
death
and
in
imagination
he
underwent
some
part
of
death
horrors
and
felt
in
his
living
body
a
taste
of
those
dying
pangs
which
he
had
dealt
to
others
that
with
the
strong
conceit
tears
the
true
interpreters
of
unutterable
emotion
stood
in
his
eyes
which
king
alcinous
noting
and
that
this
was
now
the
second
time
that
he
had
perceived
him
to
be
moved
at
the
mention
of
events
touching
the
trojan
wars
he
took
occasion
to
ask
whether
his
guest
had
lost
any
friend
or
kinsman
at
troy
that
demodocus
singing
had
brought
into
his
mind
then
ulysses
drying
the
tears
with
his
cloak
and
observing
that
the
eyes
of
all
the
company
were
upon
him
desirous
to
give
them
satisfaction
in
what
he
could
and
thinking
this
a
fit
time
to
reveal
his
true
name
and
destination
spake
as
follows
the
courtesies
which
ye
all
have
shown
me
and
in
particular
yourself
and
princely
daughter
o
king
alcinous
demand
from
me
that
i
should
no
longer
keep
you
in
ignorance
of
what
or
who
i
am
for
to
reserve
any
secret
from
you
who
have
with
such
openness
of
friendship
embraced
my
love
would
argue
either
a
pusillanimous
or
an
ungrateful
mind
in
me
know
then
that
i
am
that
ulysses
of
whom
i
perceive
ye
have
heard
something
who
heretofore
have
filled
the
world
with
the
renown
of
my
policies
i
am
he
by
whose
counsels
if
fame
is
to
be
believed
at
all
more
than
by
the
united
valour
of
all
the
grecians
troy
fell
i
am
that
unhappy
man
whom
the
heavens
and
angry
gods
have
conspired
to
keep
an
exile
on
the
seas
wandering
to
seek
my
home
which
still
flies
from
me
the
land
which
i
am
in
quest
of
is
ithaca
in
whose
ports
some
ship
belonging
to
your
phaeacian
state
may
haply
at
some
time
have
found
a
refuge
from
tempests
if
ever
you
have
experienced
such
kindness
requite
it
now
by
granting
to
me
who
am
the
king
of
that
land
a
passport
to
that
land
admiration
seized
all
the
court
of
alcinous
to
behold
in
their
presence
one
of
the
number
of
those
heroes
who
fought
at
troy
whose
divine
story
had
been
made
known
to
them
by
songs
and
poems
but
of
the
truth
they
had
little
known
or
rather
they
had
hitherto
accounted
those
heroic
exploits
as
fictions
and
exaggerations
of
poets
but
having
seen
and
made
proof
of
the
real
ulysses
they
began
to
take
those
supposed
inventions
to
be
real
verities
and
the
tale
of
troy
to
be
as
true
as
it
was
delightful
then
king
alcinous
made
answer
thrice
fortunate
ought
we
to
esteem
our
lot
in
having
seen
and
conversed
with
a
man
of
whom
report
hath
spoken
so
loudly
but
as
it
seems
nothing
beyond
the
truth
though
we
could
desire
no
felicity
greater
than
to
have
you
always
among
us
renowned
ulysses
yet
your
desire
having
been
expressed
so
often
and
so
deeply
to
return
home
we
can
deny
you
nothing
though
to
our
own
loss
our
kingdom
of
phaeacia
as
you
know
is
chiefly
rich
in
shipping
in
all
parts
of
the
world
where
there
are
navigable
seas
or
ships
can
pass
our
vessels
will
be
found
you
can
not
name
a
coast
to
which
they
do
not
resort
every
rock
and
every
quicksand
is
known
to
them
that
lurks
in
the
vast
deep
they
pass
a
bird
in
flight
and
with
such
unerring
certainty
they
make
to
their
destination
that
some
have
said
that
they
have
no
need
of
pilot
or
rudder
but
that
they
move
instinctively
and
know
the
minds
of
their
voyagers
thus
much
that
you
may
not
fear
to
trust
yourself
in
one
of
our
phaeacian
ships
tomorrow
if
you
please
you
shall
launch
forth
spend
with
us
in
feasting
who
never
can
do
enough
when
the
gods
send
such
visitors
ulysses
acknowledged
king
alcinous
bounty
and
while
these
two
royal
personages
stood
interchanging
courteous
expressions
the
heart
of
the
princess
nausicaa
was
overcome
she
had
been
gazing
attentively
upon
her
father
guest
as
he
delivered
his
speech
but
when
he
came
to
that
part
where
he
declared
himself
to
be
ulysses
she
blessed
herself
and
her
fortune
that
in
relieving
a
poor
shipwrecked
mariner
as
he
seemed
no
better
she
had
conferred
a
kindness
on
so
divine
a
hero
as
he
proved
and
scarce
waiting
till
her
father
had
done
speaking
with
a
cheerful
countenance
she
addressed
ulysses
bidding
him
be
cheerful
and
when
he
returned
home
as
by
her
father
means
she
trusted
he
would
shortly
sometimes
to
remember
to
whom
he
owed
his
life
and
who
met
him
in
the
woods
by
the
river
callicoe
fair
flower
of
phaeacia
he
replied
so
may
all
the
gods
bless
me
with
the
strife
of
joys
in
that
desired
day
whenever
i
shall
see
it
as
i
shall
always
acknowledge
to
be
indebted
to
your
fair
hand
for
the
gift
of
life
which
i
enjoy
and
all
the
blessings
which
shall
follow
upon
my
the
gods
give
thee
nausicaa
a
princely
husband
and
from
you
two
spring
blessings
to
this
state
so
prayed
ulysses
his
heart
overflowing
with
admiration
and
grateful
recollections
of
king
daughter
then
at
the
king
request
he
gave
them
a
brief
relation
of
all
the
adventures
that
had
befallen
him
since
he
launched
forth
from
troy
during
which
the
princess
nausicaa
took
great
delight
as
ladies
are
commonly
taken
with
these
kind
of
travellers
stories
to
hear
of
the
monster
polyphemus
of
the
men
that
devour
each
other
in
laestrygonia
of
the
enchantress
circe
of
scylla
and
the
rest
to
which
she
listened
with
a
breathless
attention
letting
fall
a
shower
of
tears
from
her
fair
eyes
every
now
and
then
when
ulysses
told
of
some
more
than
usual
distressful
passage
in
his
travels
and
all
the
rest
of
his
auditors
if
they
had
before
entertained
a
high
respect
for
their
guest
now
felt
their
veneration
increased
tenfold
when
they
learned
from
his
own
mouth
what
perils
what
sufferance
what
endurance
of
evils
beyond
man
strength
to
support
this
almost
heavenly
man
by
the
greatness
of
his
mind
and
by
his
invincible
courage
had
struggled
through
illustration
gave
them
a
brief
relation
of
all
the
adventures
that
had
befallen
the
night
was
far
spent
before
ulysses
had
ended
his
narrative
and
with
wishful
glances
he
cast
his
eyes
towards
the
eastern
parts
which
the
sun
had
begun
to
flecker
with
his
first
red
for
on
the
morrow
alcinous
had
promised
that
a
bark
should
be
in
readiness
to
convoy
him
to
ithaca
in
the
morning
a
vessel
well
manned
and
appointed
was
waiting
for
him
into
which
the
king
and
queen
heaped
presents
of
gold
and
silver
massy
plate
apparel
armour
and
whatsoever
things
of
cost
or
rarity
they
judged
would
be
most
acceptable
to
their
guest
and
the
sails
being
set
ulysses
embarking
with
expressions
of
regret
took
his
leave
of
his
royal
entertainers
of
the
fair
princess
who
had
been
his
first
friend
and
of
the
peers
of
phaeacia
who
crowding
down
to
the
beach
to
have
the
last
sight
of
their
illustrious
visitant
beheld
the
gallant
ship
with
all
her
canvas
spread
bounding
and
curveting
over
the
waves
like
a
horse
proud
of
his
rider
or
as
if
she
knew
that
in
her
capacious
womb
rich
freightage
she
bore
ulysses
he
whose
life
past
had
been
a
series
of
disquiets
in
seas
among
rude
waves
in
battles
amongst
ruder
foes
now
slept
securely
forgetting
all
his
bound
in
such
deep
sleep
as
only
yielded
to
death
and
when
they
reached
the
nearest
ithacan
port
by
the
next
morning
he
was
still
asleep
the
mariners
not
willing
to
awake
him
landed
him
softly
and
laid
him
in
a
cave
at
the
foot
of
an
which
made
a
shady
recess
in
that
narrow
harbour
the
haunt
of
almost
none
but
the
which
are
called
naiads
few
ships
before
this
phaeacian
vessel
having
put
into
that
haven
by
reason
of
the
difficulty
and
narrowness
of
the
entrance
here
leaving
him
asleep
and
disposing
in
safe
places
near
him
the
presents
with
which
king
alcinous
had
dismissed
him
they
departed
for
phaeacia
where
these
wretched
mariners
never
again
set
foot
but
just
as
they
arrived
and
thought
to
salute
their
country
earth
in
sight
of
their
city
turrets
and
in
open
view
of
their
friends
who
from
the
harbour
with
shouts
greeted
their
return
their
vessel
and
all
the
mariners
which
were
in
her
were
turned
to
stone
and
stood
transformed
and
fixed
in
sight
of
the
whole
phaeacian
city
where
it
yet
stands
by
neptune
vindictive
wrath
who
resented
thus
highly
the
contempt
which
those
phaeacians
had
shown
in
convoying
home
a
man
whom
the
god
had
destined
to
destruction
whence
it
comes
to
pass
that
the
phaeacians
at
this
day
will
at
no
price
be
induced
to
lend
their
ships
to
strangers
or
to
become
the
carriers
for
other
nations
so
highly
do
they
still
dread
the
displeasure
of
their
while
they
see
that
terrible
monument
ever
in
sight
when
ulysses
awoke
which
was
not
till
some
time
after
the
mariners
had
departed
he
did
not
at
first
know
his
country
again
either
that
long
absence
had
made
it
strange
or
that
minerva
which
was
more
likely
had
cast
a
cloud
about
his
eyes
that
he
should
have
greater
pleasure
hereafter
in
discovering
his
mistake
but
like
a
man
suddenly
awaking
in
some
desert
isle
to
which
his
have
transported
him
in
his
sleep
he
looked
around
and
discerning
no
known
objects
he
cast
his
hands
to
heaven
for
pity
and
complained
on
those
ruthless
men
who
had
beguiled
him
with
a
promise
of
conveying
him
home
to
this
country
and
perfidiously
left
him
to
perish
in
an
unknown
land
but
then
the
rich
presents
of
gold
and
silver
given
him
by
alcinous
which
he
saw
carefully
laid
up
in
secure
places
near
him
staggered
him
which
seemed
not
like
the
act
of
wrongful
or
unjust
men
such
as
turn
pirates
for
gain
or
land
helpless
passengers
in
remote
coasts
to
possess
themselves
of
their
goods
while
he
remained
in
this
suspense
there
came
up
to
him
a
young
shepherd
clad
in
the
finer
sort
of
apparel
such
as
kings
sons
wore
in
those
days
when
princes
did
not
disdain
to
tend
sheep
who
accosting
him
was
saluted
again
by
ulysses
who
asked
him
what
country
that
was
on
which
he
had
been
just
landed
and
whether
it
were
part
of
a
continent
or
an
island
the
young
shepherd
made
show
of
wonder
to
hear
any
one
ask
the
name
of
that
land
as
country
people
are
apt
to
esteem
those
for
mainly
ignorant
and
barbarous
who
do
not
know
the
names
of
places
which
are
familiar
to
though
perhaps
they
who
ask
have
had
no
opportunities
of
knowing
and
may
have
come
from
far
countries
i
had
thought
said
he
that
all
people
knew
our
land
it
is
rocky
and
barren
to
be
sure
but
well
enough
it
feeds
a
goat
or
an
ox
well
it
is
not
wanting
either
in
wine
or
in
wheat
it
has
good
springs
of
water
some
fair
rivers
and
wood
enough
as
you
may
see
it
is
called
ithaca
ulysses
was
joyed
enough
to
find
himself
in
his
own
country
but
so
prudently
he
carried
his
joy
that
dissembling
his
true
name
and
quality
he
pretended
to
the
shepherd
that
he
was
only
some
foreigner
who
by
stress
of
weather
had
put
into
that
port
and
framed
on
the
sudden
a
story
to
make
it
plausible
how
he
had
come
from
crete
in
a
ship
of
phaeacia
when
the
young
shepherd
laughing
and
taking
ulysses
hand
in
both
his
said
to
him
he
must
be
cunning
i
find
who
thinks
to
overreach
you
what
can
not
you
quit
your
wiles
and
your
subtleties
now
that
you
are
in
a
state
of
security
must
the
first
word
with
which
you
salute
your
native
earth
be
an
untruth
and
think
you
that
you
are
unknown
ulysses
looked
again
and
he
saw
not
a
shepherd
but
a
beautiful
woman
whom
he
immediately
knew
to
be
the
goddess
minerva
that
in
the
wars
of
troy
had
frequently
vouchsafed
her
sight
to
him
and
had
been
with
him
since
in
perils
saving
him
unseen
let
not
my
ignorance
offend
thee
great
minerva
he
cried
or
move
thy
displeasure
that
in
that
shape
i
knew
thee
not
since
the
skill
of
discerning
of
deities
is
not
attainable
by
wit
or
study
but
hard
to
be
hit
by
the
wisest
of
mortals
to
know
thee
truly
through
all
thy
changes
is
only
given
to
those
whom
thou
art
pleased
to
grace
to
all
men
thou
takest
all
likenesses
all
men
in
their
wits
think
that
they
know
thee
and
that
they
have
thee
thou
art
wisdom
itself
but
a
semblance
of
thee
which
is
false
wisdom
often
is
taken
for
thee
so
thy
counterfeit
view
appears
to
many
but
thy
true
presence
to
few
those
are
they
which
loving
thee
above
all
are
inspired
with
light
from
thee
to
know
thee
but
this
i
surely
know
that
all
the
time
the
sons
of
greece
waged
war
against
troy
i
was
sundry
times
graced
with
thy
appearance
but
since
i
have
never
been
able
to
set
eyes
upon
thee
till
now
but
have
wandered
at
my
own
discretion
to
myself
a
blind
guide
erring
up
and
down
the
world
wanting
thee
then
minerva
cleared
his
eyes
and
he
knew
the
ground
on
which
he
stood
to
be
ithaca
and
that
cave
to
be
the
same
which
the
people
of
ithaca
had
in
former
times
made
sacred
to
the
and
where
he
himself
had
done
sacrifices
to
them
a
thousand
times
and
full
in
his
view
stood
mount
nerytus
with
all
his
woods
so
that
now
he
knew
for
a
certainty
that
he
was
arrived
in
his
own
country
and
with
the
delight
which
he
felt
he
could
not
forbear
stooping
down
and
kissing
the
soil
chapter

the
change
from
a
king
to
a
eumaeus
and
the
telemachus
not
long
did
minerva
suffer
him
to
indulge
vain
transports
but
briefly
recounting
to
him
the
events
which
had
taken
place
in
ithaca
during
his
absence
she
showed
him
that
his
way
to
his
wife
and
throne
did
not
lie
so
open
but
that
before
he
were
reinstated
in
the
secure
possession
of
them
he
must
encounter
many
difficulties
his
palace
wanting
its
king
was
become
the
resort
of
insolent
and
imperious
men
the
chief
nobility
of
ithaca
and
of
the
neighboring
isles
who
in
the
confidence
of
ulysses
being
dead
came
as
suitors
to
penelope
the
queen
it
was
true
continued
single
but
was
little
better
than
a
in
the
power
of
these
men
who
under
a
pretence
of
waiting
her
decision
occupied
the
house
rather
as
owners
than
guests
lording
and
domineering
at
their
pleasure
profaning
the
palace
and
wasting
the
royal
substance
with
their
feasts
and
mad
riots
moreover
the
goddess
told
him
how
fearing
the
attempts
of
these
lawless
men
upon
the
person
of
his
young
son
telemachus
she
herself
had
put
it
into
the
heart
of
the
prince
to
go
and
seek
his
father
in
far
countries
how
in
the
shape
of
mentor
she
had
borne
him
company
in
his
long
search
which
though
failing
as
she
meant
it
should
fail
in
its
first
object
had
yet
had
this
effect
that
through
hardships
he
had
learned
endurance
through
experience
he
had
gathered
wisdom
and
wherever
his
footsteps
had
been
he
had
left
such
memorials
of
his
worth
as
the
fame
of
ulysses
son
was
already
blown
throughout
the
world
that
it
was
now
not
many
days
since
telemachus
had
arrived
in
the
island
to
the
great
joy
of
the
queen
his
mother
who
had
thought
him
dead
by
reason
of
his
long
absence
and
had
begun
to
mourn
for
him
with
a
grief
equal
to
that
which
she
endured
for
ulysses
the
goddess
herself
having
so
ordered
the
course
of
his
adventures
that
the
time
of
his
return
should
correspond
with
the
return
of
ulysses
that
they
might
together
concert
measures
how
to
repress
the
power
and
insolence
of
those
wicked
suitors
this
the
goddess
told
him
but
of
the
particulars
of
his
son
adventures
of
his
having
been
detained
in
the
delightful
island
which
his
father
had
so
lately
left
of
calypso
and
her
nymphs
and
the
many
strange
occurrences
which
may
be
read
with
profit
and
delight
in
the
history
of
the
adventures
she
forbore
to
tell
him
as
yet
as
judging
that
he
would
hear
them
with
greater
pleasure
from
the
lips
of
his
son
when
he
should
have
him
in
an
hour
of
stillness
and
safety
when
their
work
should
be
done
and
none
of
their
enemies
left
alive
to
trouble
them
illustration
how
they
might
with
safety
bring
about
his
then
they
sat
down
the
goddess
and
ulysses
at
the
foot
of
a
wild
consulting
how
they
might
with
safety
bring
about
his
restoration
and
when
ulysses
revolved
in
his
mind
how
that
his
enemies
were
a
multitude
and
he
single
he
began
to
despond
and
he
said
i
shall
die
an
ill
death
like
agamemnon
in
the
threshold
of
my
own
house
i
shall
perish
like
that
unfortunate
monarch
slain
by
some
one
of
my
suitors
but
then
again
calling
to
mind
his
ancient
courage
he
secretly
wished
that
minerva
would
but
breathe
such
a
spirit
into
his
bosom
as
she
inflamed
him
with
in
the
hour
of
troy
destruction
that
he
might
encounter
with
three
hundred
of
those
impudent
suitors
at
once
and
strew
the
pavements
of
his
beautiful
palace
with
their
bloods
and
brains
and
minerva
knew
his
thoughts
and
she
said
i
will
be
strongly
with
thee
if
thou
fail
not
to
do
thy
part
and
for
a
sign
between
us
that
i
will
perform
my
promise
and
for
a
token
on
thy
part
of
obedience
i
must
change
thee
that
thy
person
may
not
be
known
of
men
then
ulysses
bowed
his
head
to
receive
the
divine
impression
and
minerva
by
her
great
power
changed
his
person
so
that
it
might
not
be
known
she
changed
him
to
appearance
into
a
very
old
man
yet
such
a
one
as
by
his
limbs
and
gait
seemed
to
have
been
some
considerable
person
in
his
time
and
to
retain
yet
some
remains
of
his
once
prodigious
strength
also
instead
of
those
rich
robes
in
which
king
alcinous
had
clothed
him
she
threw
over
his
limbs
such
old
and
tattered
rags
as
wandering
beggars
usually
wear
a
staff
supported
his
steps
and
a
scrip
hung
to
his
back
such
as
travelling
mendicants
used
to
hold
the
scraps
which
are
given
to
them
at
rich
men
doors
so
from
a
king
he
became
a
beggar
as
wise
tiresias
had
predicted
to
him
in
the
shades
to
complete
his
humiliation
and
to
prove
his
obedience
by
suffering
she
next
directed
him
in
his
beggarly
attire
to
go
and
present
himself
to
his
old
herdsman
eumaeus
who
had
the
care
of
his
swine
and
his
cattle
and
had
been
a
faithful
steward
to
him
all
the
time
of
his
absence
then
strictly
charging
ulysses
that
he
should
reveal
himself
to
no
man
but
to
his
own
son
whom
she
would
send
to
him
when
she
saw
occasion
the
goddess
went
her
way
the
transformed
ulysses
bent
his
course
to
the
cottage
of
the
herdsman
and
entering
in
at
the
front
court
the
dogs
of
which
eumaeus
kept
many
fierce
ones
for
the
protection
of
the
cattle
flew
with
open
mouths
upon
him
as
those
ignoble
animals
have
oftentimes
an
antipathy
to
the
sight
of
anything
like
a
beggar
and
would
have
rent
him
in
pieces
with
their
teeth
if
ulysses
had
not
had
the
prudence
to
let
fall
his
staff
which
had
chiefly
provoked
their
fury
and
sat
himself
down
in
a
careless
fashion
upon
the
ground
but
for
all
that
some
serious
hurt
had
certainly
been
done
to
him
so
raging
the
dogs
were
had
not
the
herdsman
whom
the
barking
of
the
dogs
had
fetched
out
of
the
house
with
shouting
and
with
throwing
of
stones
repressed
them
he
said
when
he
saw
ulysses
old
father
how
near
you
were
to
being
torn
in
pieces
by
these
rude
dogs
i
should
never
have
forgiven
myself
if
through
neglect
of
mine
any
hurt
had
happened
to
you
but
heaven
has
given
me
so
many
cares
to
my
portion
that
i
might
well
be
excused
for
not
attending
to
everything
while
here
i
lie
grieving
and
mourning
for
the
absence
of
that
majesty
which
once
ruled
here
and
am
forced
to
fatten
his
swine
and
his
cattle
for
food
to
evil
men
who
hate
him
and
who
wish
his
death
when
he
perhaps
strays
up
and
down
the
world
and
has
not
wherewith
to
appease
hunger
if
indeed
he
yet
lives
which
is
a
question
and
enjoys
the
cheerful
light
of
the
sun
this
he
said
little
thinking
that
he
of
whom
he
spoke
now
stood
before
him
and
that
in
that
uncouth
disguise
and
beggarly
obscurity
was
present
the
hidden
majesty
of
ulysses
then
he
had
his
guest
into
the
house
and
sat
meat
and
drink
before
him
and
ulysses
said
may
jove
and
all
the
other
gods
requite
you
for
the
kind
speeches
and
hospitable
usage
which
you
have
shown
me
eumaeus
made
answer
my
poor
guest
if
one
in
much
worse
plight
than
yourself
had
arrived
here
it
were
a
shame
to
such
scanty
means
as
i
have
if
i
had
let
him
depart
without
entertaining
him
to
the
best
of
my
ability
poor
men
and
such
as
have
no
houses
of
their
own
are
by
jove
himself
recommended
to
our
care
but
the
cheer
which
we
that
are
servants
to
other
men
have
to
bestow
is
but
sorry
at
most
yet
freely
and
lovingly
i
give
it
you
indeed
there
once
ruled
here
a
man
whose
return
the
gods
have
set
their
faces
against
who
if
he
had
been
suffered
to
reign
in
peace
and
grow
old
among
us
would
have
been
kind
to
me
and
mine
but
he
is
gone
and
for
his
sake
would
to
god
that
the
whole
posterity
of
helen
might
perish
with
her
since
in
her
quarrel
so
many
worthies
have
perished
but
such
as
your
fare
is

it
and
be
welcome
such
lean
beasts
as
are
food
for
poor
herdsmen
the
fattest
go
to
feed
the
voracious
stomachs
of
the
queen

shame
on
their
unworthiness
there
is
no
day
in
which
two
or
three
of
the
noblest
of
the
herd
are
not
slain
to
support
their
feasts
and
their
surfeits
illustration
such
as
your
fare
is
eat
it
and
be
ulysses
gave
good
ear
to
his
words
and
as
he
ate
his
meat
he
even
tore
it
and
rent
it
with
his
teeth
for
mere
vexation
that
his
fat
cattle
should
be
slain
to
glut
the
appetites
of
those
godless
suitors
and
he
said
what
chief
or
what
ruler
is
this
that
thou
commendest
so
highly
and
sayest
that
he
perished
at
troy
i
am
but
a
stranger
in
these
parts
it
may
be
i
have
heard
of
some
such
in
my
long
travels
eumaeus
answered
old
father
never
any
one
of
all
the
strangers
that
have
come
to
our
coast
with
news
of
ulysses
being
alive
could
gain
credit
with
the
queen
or
her
son
yet
these
travellers
to
get
raiment
or
a
meal
will
not
stick
to
invent
any
lie
truth
is
not
the
commodity
they
deal
in
never
did
the
queen
get
anything
of
them
but
lies
she
receives
all
that
come
graciously
hears
their
stories
inquires
all
she
can
but
all
ends
in
tears
and
dissatisfaction
but
in
god
name
old
father
if
you
have
got
a
tale
make
the
most
o
it
may
gain
you
a
cloak
or
a
coat
from
somebody
to
keep
you
warm
but
for
him
who
is
the
subject
of
it
dogs
and
vultures
long
since
have
torn
him
limb
from
limb
or
some
great
fish
at
sea
has
devoured
him
or
he
lieth
with
no
better
monument
upon
his
bones
than
the
but
for
me
past
all
the
race
of
men
were
tears
created
for
i
never
shall
find
so
kind
a
royal
master
more
not
if
my
father
or
my
mother
could
come
again
and
visit
me
from
the
tomb
would
my
eyes
be
so
blessed
as
they
should
be
with
the
sight
of
him
again
coming
as
from
the
dead
in
his
last
rest
my
soul
shall
love
him
he
is
not
here
nor
do
i
name
him
as
a
flatterer
but
because
i
am
thankful
for
his
love
and
care
which
he
had
to
me
a
poor
man
and
if
i
knew
surely
that
he
were
past
all
shores
that
the
sun
shines
upon
i
would
invoke
him
as
a
deified
thing
for
this
saying
of
eumaeus
the
waters
stood
in
ulysses
eyes
and
he
said
my
friend
to
say
and
to
affirm
positively
that
he
can
not
be
alive
is
to
give
too
much
license
to
incredulity
for
not
to
speak
at
random
but
with
as
much
solemnity
as
an
oath
comes
to
i
say
to
you
that
ulysses
shall
return
and
whenever
that
day
shall
be
then
shall
you
give
to
me
a
cloak
and
a
coat
but
till
then
i
will
not
receive
so
much
as
a
thread
of
a
garment
but
rather
go
naked
for
no
less
than
the
gates
of
hell
do
i
hate
that
man
whom
poverty
can
force
to
tell
an
untruth
be
jove
then
witness
to
my
words
that
this
very
year
nay
ere
this
month
be
fully
ended
your
eyes
shall
behold
ulysses
dealing
vengeance
in
his
own
palace
upon
the
wrongers
of
his
wife
and
his
son
to
give
the
better
credence
to
his
words
he
amused
eumaeus
with
a
forged
story
of
his
life
feigning
of
himself
that
he
was
a
cretan
born
and
one
that
went
with
idomeneus
to
the
wars
of
troy
also
he
said
that
he
knew
ulysses
and
related
various
passages
which
he
alleged
to
have
happened
betwixt
ulysses
and
himself
which
were
either
true
in
the
main
as
having
really
happened
between
ulysses
and
some
other
person
or
were
so
like
to
truth
as
corresponding
with
the
known
character
and
actions
of
ulysses
that
eumaeus
incredulity
was
not
a
little
shaken
among
other
things
he
asserted
that
he
had
lately
been
entertained
in
the
court
of
thesprotia
where
the
king
son
of
the
country
had
told
him
that
ulysses
had
been
there
but
just
before
him
and
was
gone
upon
a
voyage
to
the
oracle
of
jove
in
dodona
whence
he
should
shortly
return
and
a
ship
would
be
ready
by
the
bounty
of
the
thesprotians
to
convoy
him
straight
to
ithaca
and
in
token
that
what
i
tell
you
is
true
said
ulysses
if
your
king
come
not
within
the
period
which
i
have
named
you
shall
have
leave
to
give
your
servants
commandment
to
take
my
old
carcass
and
throw
it
headlong
from
some
steep
rock
into
the
sea
that
poor
men
taking
example
by
me
may
fear
to
lie
but
eumaeus
made
answer
that
that
should
be
small
satisfaction
or
pleasure
to
him
so
while
they
sat
discoursing
in
this
manner
supper
was
served
in
and
the
servants
of
the
herdsman
who
had
been
out
all
day
in
the
fields
came
in
to
supper
and
took
their
seats
at
the
fire
for
the
night
was
bitter
and
frosty
after
supper
ulysses
who
had
well
eaten
and
drunken
and
was
refreshed
with
the
herdsman
good
cheer
was
resolved
to
try
whether
his
host
hospitality
would
extend
to
the
lending
him
a
good
warm
mantle
or
rug
to
cover
him
in
the
night
season
and
framing
an
artful
tale
for
the
purpose
in
a
merry
mood
filling
a
cup
of
greek
wine
he
thus
began
i
will
tell
you
a
story
of
your
king
ulysses
and
myself
if
there
is
ever
a
time
when
a
man
may
have
leave
to
tell
his
own
stories
it
is
when
he
has
drunken
a
little
too
much
strong
liquor
driveth
the
fool
and
moves
even
the
heart
of
the
wise
moves
and
impels
him
to
sing
and
to
dance
and
break
forth
in
pleasant
laughters
and
perchance
to
prefer
a
speech
too
which
were
better
kept
in
when
the
heart
is
open
the
tongue
will
be
stirring
but
you
shall
hear
we
led
our
powers
to
ambush
once
under
the
walls
of
troy
the
herdsmen
crowded
about
him
eager
to
hear
anything
which
related
to
their
king
ulysses
and
the
wars
of
troy
and
thus
he
went
on
i
remember
ulysses
and
menelaus
had
the
direction
of
that
enterprise
and
they
were
pleased
to
join
me
with
them
in
the
command
i
was
at
that
time
in
some
repute
among
men
though
fortune
has
played
me
a
trick
since
as
you
may
perceive
but
i
was
somebody
in
those
times
and
could
do
something
be
that
as
it
may
a
bitter
freezing
night
it
was
such
a
night
as
this
the
air
cut
like
steel
and
the
sleet
gathered
on
our
shields
like
crystal
there
was
some
twenty
of
us
that
lay
close
crouched
down
among
the
reeds
and
bulrushes
that
grew
in
the
moat
that
goes
round
the
city
the
rest
of
us
made
tolerable
shift
for
every
man
had
been
careful
to
bring
with
him
a
good
cloak
or
mantle
to
wrap
over
his
armour
and
keep
himself
warm
but
i
as
it
chanced
had
left
my
cloak
behind
me
as
not
expecting
that
the
night
would
prove
so
cold
or
rather
i
believe
because
i
had
at
that
time
a
brave
suit
of
new
armour
on
which
being
a
soldier
and
having
some
of
the
soldier
vice
about
me
i
was
not
willing
should
be
hidden
under
a
cloak
but
i
paid
for
my
indiscretion
with
my
sufferings
for
with
the
inclement
night
and
the
wet
of
the
ditch
in
which
we
lay
i
was
frozen
to
death
and
when
i
could
endure
no
longer
i
jogged
ulysses
who
was
next
to
me
and
had
a
nimble
ear
and
made
known
my
case
to
him
assuring
him
that
i
must
inevitably
perish
he
answered
in
a
low
whisper
lest
any
greek
should
hear
you
and
take
notice
of
your
softness
not
a
word
more
he
said
but
showed
as
if
he
had
no
pity
for
the
plight
i
was
in
but
he
was
as
considerate
as
he
was
brave
and
even
then
as
he
lay
with
his
head
reposing
upon
his
hand
he
was
meditating
how
to
relieve
me
without
exposing
my
weakness
to
the
soldiers
at
last
raising
up
his
head
he
made
as
if
he
had
been
asleep
and
said
i
have
been
warned
in
a
dream
to
send
to
the
fleet
to
king
agamemnon
for
a
supply
to
recruit
our
numbers
for
we
are
not
sufficient
for
this
enterprise
and
they
believing
him
one
thoas
was
despatched
on
that
errand
who
departing
for
more
speed
as
ulysses
had
foreseen
left
his
upper
garment
behind
him
a
good
warm
mantle
to
which
i
succeeded
and
by
the
help
of
it
got
through
the
night
with
credit
this
shift
ulysses
made
for
one
in
need
and
would
to
heaven
that
i
had
now
that
strength
in
my
limbs
which
made
me
in
those
days
to
be
accounted
fit
to
be
a
leader
under
ulysses
i
should
not
then
want
the
loan
of
a
cloak
or
a
mantle
to
wrap
about
me
and
shield
my
old
limbs
from
the
night
air
the
tale
pleased
the
herdsmen
and
eumaeus
who
more
than
all
the
rest
was
gratified
to
hear
tales
of
ulysses
true
or
false
said
that
for
his
story
he
deserved
a
mantle
and
a
night
lodging
which
he
should
have
and
he
spread
for
him
a
bed
of
goat
and
sheep
skins
by
the
fire
and
the
seeming
beggar
who
was
indeed
the
true
ulysses
lay
down
and
slept
under
that
poor
roof
in
that
abject
disguise
to
which
the
will
of
minerva
had
subjected
him
when
morning
was
come
ulysses
made
offer
to
depart
as
if
he
were
not
willing
to
burden
his
host
hospitality
any
longer
but
said
that
he
would
go
and
try
the
humanity
of
the
townsfolk
if
any
there
would
bestow
upon
him
a
bit
of
bread
or
a
cup
of
drink
perhaps
the
queen
suitors
he
said
out
of
their
full
feasts
would
bestow
a
scrap
on
him
for
he
could
wait
at
table
if
need
were
and
play
the
nimble
he
could
fetch
wood
he
said
or
build
a
fire
prepare
roast
meat
or
boiled
mix
the
wine
with
water
or
do
any
of
those
offices
which
recommended
poor
men
like
him
to
services
in
great
men
houses
alas
poor
guest
said
eumaeus
you
know
not
what
you
speak
what
should
so
poor
and
old
a
man
as
you
do
at
the
suitors
tables
their
light
minds
are
not
given
to
such
grave
servitors
they
must
have
youths
richly
tricked
out
in
flowing
vests
with
curled
hair
like
so
many
of
cupbearers
to
fill
out
the
wine
to
them
as
they
sit
at
table
and
to
shift
their
trenchers
their
gorged
insolence
would
but
despise
and
make
a
mock
at
thy
age
stay
here
perhaps
the
queen
or
telemachus
hearing
of
thy
arrival
may
send
to
thee
of
their
bounty
as
he
spake
these
words
the
steps
of
one
crossing
the
front
court
were
heard
and
a
noise
of
the
dogs
fawning
and
leaping
about
as
for
joy
by
which
token
eumaeus
guessed
that
it
was
the
prince
who
hearing
of
a
traveller
being
arrived
at
eumaeus
cottage
that
brought
tidings
of
his
father
was
come
to
search
the
truth
and
eumaeus
said
it
is
the
tread
of
telemachus
the
son
of
king
ulysses
before
he
could
well
speak
the
words
the
prince
was
at
the
door
whom
ulysses
rising
to
receive
telemachus
would
not
suffer
that
so
aged
a
man
as
he
appeared
should
rise
to
do
respect
to
him
but
he
courteously
and
reverently
took
him
by
the
hand
and
inclined
his
head
to
him
as
if
he
had
surely
known
that
it
was
his
father
indeed
but
ulysses
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
that
he
might
not
show
the
waters
which
stood
in
them
and
telemachus
said
is
this
the
man
who
can
tell
us
tidings
of
the
king
my
father
he
brags
himself
to
be
a
cretan
born
said
eumaeus
and
that
he
has
been
a
soldier
and
a
traveller
but
whether
he
speak
the
truth
or
not
he
alone
can
tell
but
whatsoever
he
has
been
what
he
is
now
is
apparent
such
as
he
appears
i
give
him
to
you
do
what
you
will
with
him
his
boast
at
present
is
that
he
is
at
the
very
best
a
supplicant
be
he
what
he
may
said
telemachus
i
accept
him
at
your
hands
but
where
i
should
bestow
him
i
know
not
seeing
that
in
the
palace
his
age
would
not
exempt
him
from
the
scorn
and
contempt
which
my
mother
suitors
in
their
light
minds
would
be
sure
to
fling
upon
him
a
mercy
if
he
escaped
without
blows
for
they
are
a
company
of
evil
men
whose
profession
is
wrongs
and
violence
ulysses
answered
since
it
is
free
for
any
man
to
speak
in
presence
of
your
greatness
i
must
say
that
my
heart
puts
on
a
wolfish
inclination
to
tear
and
to
devour
hearing
your
speech
that
these
suitors
should
with
such
injustice
rage
where
you
should
have
the
rule
solely
what
should
the
cause
be
do
you
wilfully
give
way
to
their
ill
manners
or
has
your
government
been
such
as
has
procured
towards
you
from
your
people
or
do
you
mistrust
your
kinsfolk
and
friends
in
such
sort
as
without
trial
to
decline
their
aid
a
man
kindred
are
they
that
he
might
trust
to
when
extremities
run
high
telemachus
replied
the
kindred
of
ulysses
are
few
i
have
no
brothers
to
assist
me
in
the
strife
but
the
suitors
are
powerful
in
kindred
and
friends
the
house
of
old
arcesius
has
had
this
fate
from
the
heavens
that
from
old
it
still
has
been
supplied
with
single
heirs
to
arcesius
laertes
only
was
born
from
laertes
descended
only
ulysses
from
ulysses
i
alone
have
sprung
whom
he
left
so
young
that
from
me
never
comfort
arose
to
him
but
the
end
of
all
rests
in
the
hands
of
the
gods
then
eumaeus
departing
to
see
to
some
necessary
business
of
his
herds
minerva
took
a
woman
shape
and
stood
in
the
entry
of
the
door
and
was
seen
to
ulysses
but
by
his
son
she
was
not
seen
for
the
presences
of
the
gods
are
invisible
save
to
those
to
whom
they
will
to
reveal
themselves
nevertheless
the
dogs
which
were
about
the
door
saw
the
goddess
and
durst
not
bark
but
went
crouching
and
licking
of
the
dust
for
fear
and
giving
signs
to
ulysses
that
the
time
was
now
come
in
which
he
should
make
himself
known
to
his
son
by
her
great
power
she
changed
back
his
shape
into
the
same
which
it
was
before
she
transformed
him
and
telemachus
who
saw
the
change
but
nothing
of
the
manner
by
which
it
was
effected
only
he
saw
the
appearance
of
a
king
in
the
vigour
of
his
age
where
but
just
now
he
had
seen
a
worn
and
decrepit
beggar
was
struck
with
fear
and
said
some
god
has
done
this
house
this
honour
and
he
turned
away
his
eyes
and
would
have
worshipped
but
his
father
permitted
not
but
said
look
better
at
me
i
am
no
deity
why
put
you
upon
me
the
reputation
of
godhead
i
am
no
more
but
thy
father
i
am
even
he
i
am
that
ulysses
by
reason
of
whose
absence
thy
youth
has
been
exposed
to
such
wrongs
from
injurious
men
then
kissed
he
his
son
nor
could
any
longer
refrain
those
tears
which
he
had
held
under
such
mighty
restraint
before
though
they
would
ever
be
forcing
themselves
out
in
spite
of
him
but
now
as
if
their
sluices
had
burst
they
came
out
like
rivers
pouring
upon
the
warm
cheeks
of
his
son
nor
yet
by
all
these
violent
arguments
could
telemachus
be
persuaded
to
believe
that
it
was
his
father
but
he
said
some
deity
had
taken
that
shape
to
mock
him
for
he
affirmed
that
it
was
not
in
the
power
of
any
man
who
is
sustained
by
mortal
food
to
change
his
shape
so
in
a
moment
from
age
to
youth
for
but
now
said
he
you
were
all
wrinkles
and
were
old
and
now
you
look
as
the
gods
are
pictured
illustration
am
no
more
but
thy
father
i
am
even
his
father
replied
admire
but
fear
not
and
know
me
to
be
at
all
parts
substantially
thy
father
who
in
the
inner
powers
of
his
mind
and
the
unseen
workings
of
a
father
love
to
thee
answers
to
his
outward
shape
and
pretence
there
shall
no
more
ulysseses
come
here
i
am
he
that
after
twenty
years
absence
and
suffering
a
world
of
ill
have
recovered
at
last
the
sight
of
my
country
earth
it
was
the
will
of
minerva
that
i
should
be
changed
as
you
saw
me
she
put
me
thus
together
she
puts
together
or
takes
to
pieces
whom
she
pleases
it
is
in
the
law
of
her
free
power
to
do
it
sometimes
to
show
her
favourites
under
a
cloud
and
poor
and
again
to
restore
to
them
their
ornaments
the
gods
raise
and
throw
down
men
with
ease
then
telemachus
could
hold
out
no
longer
but
he
gave
way
now
to
a
full
belief
and
persuasion
of
that
which
for
joy
at
first
he
could
not
credit
that
it
was
indeed
his
true
and
very
father
that
stood
before
him
and
they
embraced
and
mingled
their
tears
then
said
ulysses
tell
me
who
these
suitors
are
what
are
their
numbers
and
how
stands
the
queen
thy
mother
affected
to
them
she
bears
them
still
in
expectation
said
telemachus
which
she
never
means
to
fulfil
that
she
will
accept
the
hand
of
some
one
of
them
in
second
nuptials
for
she
fears
to
displease
them
by
an
absolute
refusal
so
from
day
to
day
she
lingers
them
on
with
hope
which
they
are
content
to
bear
the
deferring
of
while
they
have
entertainment
at
free
cost
in
our
palace
then
said
ulysses
reckon
up
their
numbers
that
we
may
know
their
strength
and
ours
if
we
having
none
but
ourselves
may
hope
to
prevail
against
them
o
father
he
replied
i
have
ofttimes
heard
of
your
fame
for
wisdom
and
of
the
great
strength
of
your
arm
but
the
venturous
mind
which
your
speeches
now
indicate
moves
me
even
to
amazement
for
in
nowise
can
it
consist
with
wisdom
or
a
sound
mind
that
two
should
try
their
strengths
against
a
host
nor
five
or
ten
or
twice
ten
strong
are
these
suitors
but
many
more
by
much
from
dulichium
came
there
fifty
and
two
they
and
their
servants
twice
twelve
crossed
the
seas
hither
from
samos
from
zacynthus
twice
ten
of
our
native
ithacans
men
of
chief
note
are
twelve
who
aspire
to
the
bed
and
crown
of
penelope
and
all
these
under
one
strong
roof
a
fearful
odds
against
two
my
father
there
is
need
of
caution
lest
the
cup
which
your
great
mind
so
thirsts
to
taste
of
vengeance
prove
bitter
to
yourself
in
the
drinking
and
therefore
it
were
well
that
we
should
bethink
us
of
some
one
who
might
assist
us
in
this
undertaking
thinkest
thou
said
his
father
if
we
had
minerva
and
the
king
of
skies
to
be
our
friends
would
their
sufficiencies
make
strong
our
part
or
must
we
look
out
for
some
further
aid
yet
they
you
speak
of
are
above
the
clouds
said
telemachus
and
are
sound
aids
indeed
as
powers
that
not
only
exceed
human
but
bear
the
chiefest
sway
among
the

the

took
his
way
leaning
on

till
he
reached
the
palace
entering
in
at
the
hall
where
the
suitors
sat
at
meat
they
in
the
pride
of
their
feasting
began
to
break
their
jests
in
mirthful
manner
when
they
saw
one
looking
so
poor
and
so
aged
approach
he
who
expected
no
better
entertainment
was
nothing
moved
at
their
behaviour
but
as
became
the
character
which
he
had
assumed
in
a
suppliant
posture
crept
by
turns
to
every
suitor
and
held
out
his
hands
for
some
charity
with
such
a
natural
and
grace
that
he
might
seem
to
have
practised
begging
all
his
life
yet
there
was
a
sort
of
dignity
in
his
most
abject
stoopings
that
whoever
had
seen
him
would
have
said
if
it
had
pleased
heaven
that
this
poor
man
had
been
born
a
king
he
would
gracefully
have
filled
a
throne
and
some
pitied
him
and
some
gave
him
alms
as
their
present
humours
inclined
them
but
the
greater
part
reviled
him
and
bade
him
begone
as
one
that
spoiled
their
feast
for
the
presence
of
misery
has
this
power
with
it
that
while
it
stays
it
can

and
overturn

even
of

feel
no

or

to
relieve
it
nature
bearing
this
witness
of
herself
in
the
hearts
of
the
most
obdurate
illustration
the
greater
part
reviled
him
and
bade
him
now
telemachus
sat
at
meat
with
the
suitors
and
knew
that
it
was
the
king
his
father
who
in
that
shape
begged
an
alms
and
when
his
father
came
and
presented
himself
before
him
in
turn
as
he
had
done
to
the
suitors
one
by
one
he
gave
him
of
his
own
meat
which
he
had
in
his
dish
and
of
his
own
cup
to
drink
and
the
suitors
were
past
measure
offended
to
see
a
pitiful
beggar
as
they
esteemed
him
to
be
so
choicely
regarded
by
the
prince
then
antinous
who
was
a
great
lord
and
of
chief
note
among
the
suitors
said
prince
telemachus
does
ill
to
encourage
these
wandering
beggars
who
go
from
place
to
place
affirming
that
they
have
been
some
considerable
persons
in
their
time
filling
the
ears
of
such
as
hearken
to
them
with
lies
and
pressing
with
their
bold
feet
into
kings

this
is
some

said
ulysses
that
a
poor
man
should
get
but
little
at
your
board
scarce
should
he
get
salt
from
your
hands
if
he
brought
his
own
meat
lord
antinous
indignant
to
be
answered
with
such
sharpness
by
a
supposed
beggar
snatched
up
a
stool
with
which
he
smote
ulysses
where
the
neck
and
shoulders
join
this
usage
moved
not
ulysses
but
in
his
great
heart
he
meditated
deep
evils
to
come
upon
them
all
which
for
a
time
must
be
kept
close
and
he
went
and
sat
himself
down
in
the
to
eat
of
that
which
was
given
him
and
he
said
for
life
or
possessions
a
man
will
fight
but
for
his
belly
this
man
smites
if
a
poor
man
has
any
god
to
take
his
part
my
lord
antinous
shall
not
live
to
be
the
queen
husband
then
antinous
raged
highly
and
threatened
to
drag
him
by
the
heels
and
to
rend
his
rags
about
his
ears
if
he
spoke
another
word
but
the
other
suitors
did
in
nowise
approve
of
the
harsh
language
nor
of
the
blow
which
antinous
had
dealt
and
some
of
them
said
who
knows
but
one
of
the
deities
goes
about
hid
under
that
poor
disguise
for
in
the
likeness
of
poor
pilgrims
the
gods
have
many
times
descended
to
try
the
dispositions
of
men
whether
they
be
humane
or
impious
while
these
things
passed
telemachus
sat
and
observed
all
but
held
his
peace
remembering
the
instructions
of
his
father
but
secretly
he
waited
for
the
sign
which
minerva
was
to
send
from
heaven
that
day
there
followed
ulysses
to
the
court
one
of
the
common
sort
of
beggars
irus
by
name
one
that
had
received
alms
beforetime
of
the
suitors
and
was
their
ordinary
sport
when
they
were
inclined
as
that
day
to
give
way
to
mirth
to
see
him
eat
and
drink
for
he
had
the
appetite
of
six
men
and
was
of
huge
stature
and
proportions
of
body
yet
had
in
him
no
spirit
nor
courage
of
a
man
this
man
thinking
to
curry
favour
with
the
suitors
and
recommend
himself
especially
to
such
a
great
lord
as
antinous
was
began
to
revile
and
scorn
ulysses
putting
foul
language
upon
him
and
fairly
challenging
him
to
fight
with
the
fist
but
ulysses
deeming
his
railings
to
be
nothing
more
than
jealousy
and
that
envious
disposition
which
beggars
commonly
manifest
to
brothers
in
their
trade
mildly
besought
him
not
to
trouble
him
but
to
enjoy
that
portion
which
the
liberality
of
their
entertainers
gave
him
as
he
did
quietly
seeing
that
of
their
bounty
there
was
sufficient
for
all
but
irus
thinking
that
this
forbearance
in
ulysses
was
nothing
more
than
a
sign
of
fear
so
much
the
more
highly
stormed
and
bellowed
and
provoked
him
to
fight
and
by
this
time
the
quarrel
had
attracted
the
notice
of
the
suitors
who
with
loud
laughters
and
shouting
egged
on
the
dispute
and
lord
antinous
swore
by
all
the
gods
it
should
be
a
battle
and
that
in
that
hall
the
strife
should
be
determined
to
this
the
rest
of
the
suitors
with
violent
clamours
acceded
and
a
circle
was
made
for
the
combatants
and
a
fat
goat
was
proposed
as
the
victor
prize
as
at
the
olympic
or
the
pythian
games
then
ulysses
seeing
no
remedy
or
being
not
unwilling
that
the
suitors
should
behold
some
proof
of
that
strength
which
ere
long
in
their
own
persons
they
were
to
taste
of
stripped
himself
and
prepared
for
the
combat
but
first
he
demanded
that
he
should
have
fair
play
shown
him
that
none
in
that
assembly
should
aid
his
opponent
or
take
part
against
him
for
being
an
old
man
they
might
easily
crush
him
with
their
strengths
and
telemachus
passed
his
word
that
no
foul
play
should
be
shown
him
but
that
each
party
should
be
left
to
their
own
unassisted
strengths
and
to
this
he
made
antinous
and
the
rest
of
the
suitors
swear
but
when
ulysses
had
laid
aside
his
garments
and
was
bare
to
the
waist
all
the
beholders
admired
at
the
goodly
sight
of
his
large
shoulders
being
of
such
exquisite
shape
and
whiteness
and
at
his
great
and
brawny
bosom
and
the
youthful
strength
which
seemed
to
remain
in
a
man
thought
so
old
and
they
said
what
limbs
and
what
sinews
he
has
and
coward
fear
seized
on
the
mind
of
that
great
vast
beggar
and
he
dropped
his
threats
and
his
big
words
and
would
have
fled
but
lord
antinous
stayed
him
and
threatened
him
that
if
he
declined
the
combat
he
would
put
him
in
a
ship
and
land
him
on
the
shores
where
king
echetus
reigned
the
roughest
tyrant
which
at
that
time
the
world
contained
and
who
had
that
antipathy
to
rascal
beggars
such
as
he
that
when
any
landed
on
his
coast
he
would
crop
their
ears
and
noses
and
give
them
to
the
dogs
to
tear
so
irus
in
whom
fear
of
king
echetus
prevailed
above
the
fear
of
ulysses
addressed
himself
to
fight
but
ulysses
provoked
to
be
engaged
in
so
odious
a
strife
with
a
fellow
of
his
base
conditions
and
loathing
longer
to
be
made
a
spectacle
to
entertain
the
eyes
of
his
foes
with
one
blow
which
he
struck
him
beneath
the
ear
so
shattered
the
teeth
and
jawbone
of
this
soon
baffled
coward
that
he
laid
him
sprawling
in
the
dust
with
small
stomach
or
ability
to
renew
the
contest
then
raising
him
on
his
feet
he
led
him
bleeding
and
sputtering
to
the
door
and
put
his
staff
into
his
hand
and
bade
him
go
use
his
command
upon
dogs
and
swine
but
not
presume
himself
to
be
lord
of
the
guests
another
time
nor
of
the
beggary
the
suitors
applauded
in
their
vain
minds
the
issue
of
the
contest
and
rioted
in
mirth
at
the
expense
of
poor
irus
who
they
vowed
should
be
forthwith
embarked
and
sent
to
king
echetus
and
they
bestowed
thanks
on
ulysses
for
ridding
the
court
of
that
unsavoury
morsel
as
they
called
him
but
in
their
inward
souls
they
would
not
have
cared
if
irus
had
been
victor
and
ulysses
had
taken
the
foil
but
it
was
mirth
to
them
to
see
the
beggars
fight
in
such
pastimes
and
light
entertainments
the
day
wore
away
when
evening
was
come
the
suitors
betook
themselves
to
music
and
dancing
and
ulysses
leaned
his
back
against
a
pillar
from
which
certain
lamps
hung
which
gave
light
to
the
dancers
and
he
made
show
of
watching
the
dancers
but
very
different
thoughts
were
in
his
head
and
as
he
stood
near
the
lamps
the
light
fell
upon
his
head
which
was
thin
of
hair
and
bald
as
an
old
man
and
eurymachus
a
suitor
taking
occasion
from
some
words
which
were
spoken
before
scoffed
and
said
now
i
know
for
a
certainty
that
some
god
lurks
under
the
poor
and
beggarly
appearance
of
this
man
for
as
he
stands
by
the
lamps
his
sleek
head
throws
beams
around
it
like
as
it
were
a
glory
and
another
said
he
passes
his
time
too
not
much
unlike
the
gods
lazily
living
exempt
from
labour
taking
offerings
of
men
i
warrant
said
eurymachus
again
he
could
not
raise
a
fence
or
dig
a
ditch
for
his
livelihood
if
a
man
would
hire
him
to
work
in
a
garden
i
wish
said
ulysses
that
you
who
speak
this
and
myself
were
to
be
tried
at
any
taskwork
that
i
had
a
good
crooked
scythe
put
in
my
hand
that
was
sharp
and
strong
and
you
such
another
where
the
grass
grew
longest
to
be
up
by
daybreak
mowing
the
meadows
till
the
sun
went
down
not
tasting
of
food
till
we
had
finished
or
that
we
were
set
to
plough
four
acres
in
one
day
of
good
glebe
land
to
see
whose
furrows
were
evenest
and
cleanest
or
that
we
might
have
one
together
or
that
in
our
right
hands
a
good
lance
were
placed
to
try
whose
blows
fell
heaviest
and
thickest
upon
the
adversary
i
would
cause
you
such
work
as
you
should
have
small
reason
to
reproach
me
with
being
slack
at
work
but
you
would
do
well
to
spare
me
this
reproach
and
to
save
your
strength
till
the
owner
of
this
house
shall
return
till
the
day
when
ulysses
shall
return
when
returning
he
shall
enter
upon
his
birthright
this
was
a
galling
speech
to
those
suitors
to
whom
ulysses
return
was
indeed
the
thing
which
they
most
dreaded
and
a
sudden
fear
fell
upon
their
souls
as
if
they
were
sensible
of
the
real
presence
of
that
man
who
did
indeed
stand
amongst
them
but
not
in
that
form
as
they
might
know
him
and
eurymachus
incensed
snatched
a
massy
cup
which
stood
on
a
table
near
and
hurled
it
at
the
head
of
the
supposed
beggar
and
but
narrowly
missed
the
hitting
of
him
and
all
the
suitors
rose
as
at
once
to
thrust
him
out
of
the
hall
which
they
said
his
beggarly
presence
and
his
rude
speeches
had
profaned
but
telemachus
cried
to
them
to
forbear
and
not
to
presume
to
lay
hands
upon
a
wretched
man
to
whom
he
had
promised
protection
he
asked
if
they
were
mad
to
mix
such
abhorred
uproar
with
his
feasts
he
bade
them
take
their
food
and
their
wine
to
sit
up
or
to
go
to
bed
at
their
free
pleasures
so
long
as
he
should
give
license
to
that
freedom
but
why
should
they
abuse
his
banquet
or
let
the
words
which
a
poor
beggar
spake
have
power
to
move
their
spleens
so
they
bit
their
lips
and
frowned
for
anger
to
be
checked
so
by
a
youth
nevertheless
for
that
time
they
had
the
grace
to
abstain
either
for
shame
or
that
minerva
had
infused
into
them
a
terror
of
ulysses
son
so
that
day
feast
was
concluded
without
bloodshed
and
the
suitors
tired
with
their
sports
departed
severally
each
man
to
his
apartment
only
ulysses
and
telemachus
remained
and
now
telemachus
by
his
direction
went
and
brought
down
into
the
hall
armour
and
lances
from
the
armoury
for
ulysses
said
on
the
morrow
we
shall
have
need
of
them
and
moreover
he
said
if
any
one
shall
ask
why
you
have
taken
them
down
say
it
is
to
clean
them
and
scour
them
from
the
rust
which
they
have
gathered
since
the
owner
of
this
house
went
for
troy
and
as
telemachus
stood
by
the
armour
the
lights
were
all
gone
out
and
it
was
pitch
dark
and
the
armour
gave
out
glistering
beams
as
of
fire
and
he
said
to
his
father
the
pillars
of
the
house
are
on
fire
and
his
father
said
it
is
the
gods
who
sit
above
the
stars
and
have
power
to
make
the
night
as
light
as
the
day
and
he
took
it
for
a
good
omen
and
telemachus
fell
to
cleaning
and
sharpening
of
the
lances
now
ulysses
had
not
seen
his
wife
penelope
in
all
the
time
since
his
return
for
the
queen
did
not
care
to
mingle
with
the
suitors
at
their
banquets
but
as
became
one
that
had
been
ulysses
wife
kept
much
in
private
spinning
and
doing
her
excellent
housewiferies
among
her
maids
in
the
remote
apartments
of
the
palace
only
upon
solemn
days
she
would
come
down
and
show
herself
to
the
suitors
and
ulysses
was
filled
with
a
longing
desire
to
see
his
wife
again
whom
for
twenty
years
he
had
not
beheld
and
he
softly
stole
through
the
known
passages
of
his
beautiful
house
till
he
came
where
the
maids
were
lighting
the
queen
through
a
stately
gallery
that
led
to
the
chamber
where
she
slept
and
when
the
maids
saw
ulysses
they
said
it
is
the
beggar
who
came
to
the
court
about
whom
all
that
uproar
was
stirred
up
in
the
hall
what
does
he
here
but
penelope
gave
commandment
that
he
should
be
brought
before
her
for
she
said
it
may
be
that
he
has
travelled
and
has
heard
something
concerning
ulysses
illustration
the
maids
were
lighting
the
queen
through
a
stately
then
was
ulysses
right
glad
to
hear
himself
named
by
his
queen
to
find
himself
in
nowise
forgotten
nor
her
great
love
towards
him
decayed
in
all
that
time
that
he
had
been
away
and
he
stood
before
his
queen
and
she
knew
him
not
to
be
ulysses
but
supposed
that
he
had
been
some
poor
traveller
and
she
asked
him
of
what
country
he
was
he
told
her
as
he
had
before
told
eumaeus
that
he
was
a
cretan
born
and
however
poor
and
cast
down
he
now
seemed
no
less
a
man
than
brother
to
idomeneus
who
was
grandson
to
king
minos
and
though
he
now
wanted
bread
he
had
once
had
it
in
his
power
to
feast
ulysses
then
he
feigned
how
ulysses
sailing
for
troy
was
forced
by
stress
of
weather
to
put
his
fleet
in
at
a
port
of
crete
where
for
twelve
days
he
was
his
guest
and
entertained
by
him
with
all
befitting
and
he
described
the
very
garments
which
ulysses
had
on
by
which
penelope
knew
he
had
seen
her
lord
in
this
manner
ulysses
told
his
wife
many
tales
of
himself
at
most
but
painting
but
painting
so
near
to
the
life
that
the
feeling
of
that
which
she
took
in
at
her
ears
became
so
strong
that
the
kindly
tears
ran
down
her
fair
cheeks
while
she
thought
upon
her
lord
dead
as
she
thought
him
and
heavily
mourned
the
loss
of
him
whom
she
missed
whom
she
could
not
find
though
in
very
deed
he
stood
so
near
her
ulysses
was
moved
to
see
her
weep
but
he
kept
his
own
eyes
dry
as
iron
or
horn
in
their
lids
putting
a
bridle
upon
his
strong
passion
that
it
should
not
issue
to
sight
then
told
he
how
he
had
lately
been
at
the
court
of
thesprotia
and
what
he
had
learned
concerning
ulysses
there
in
order
as
he
had
delivered
to
eumaeus
and
penelope
was
wont
to
believe
that
there
might
be
a
possibility
of
ulysses
being
alive
and
she
said
i
dreamed
a
dream
this
morning
methought
i
had
twenty
household
fowl
which
did
eat
wheat
steeped
in
water
from
my
hand
and
there
came
suddenly
from
the
clouds
a
hawk
who
soused
on
them
and
killed
them
all
trussing
their
necks
then
took
his
flight
back
up
to
the
clouds
and
in
my
dream
methought
that
i
wept
and
made
great
moan
for
my
fowls
and
for
the
destruction
which
the
hawk
had
made
and
my
maids
came
about
me
to
comfort
me
and
in
the
height
of
my
griefs
the
hawk
came
back
and
lighting
upon
the
beam
of
my
chamber
he
said
to
me
in
a
man
voice
which
sounded
strangely
even
in
my
dream
to
hear
a
hawk
to
speak
of
good
cheer
he
said
daughter
of
icarius
for
this
is
no
dream
which
thou
hast
seen
but
that
which
shall
happen
to
thee
indeed
those
household
fowl
which
thou
lamentest
so
without
reason
are
the
suitors
who
devour
thy
substance
even
as
thou
sawest
the
fowl
eat
from
thy
hand
and
the
hawk
is
thy
husband
who
is
coming
to
give
death
to
the
suitors
and
i
awoke
and
went
to
see
to
my
fowls
if
they
were
alive
whom
i
found
eating
wheat
from
their
troughs
all
well
and
safe
as
before
my
dream
then
said
ulysses
this
dream
can
endure
no
other
interpretation
than
that
which
the
hawk
gave
to
it
who
is
your
lord
and
who
is
coming
quickly
to
effect
all
that
his
words
told
you
your
words
she
said
my
old
guest
are
so
sweet
that
would
you
sit
and
please
me
with
your
speech
my
ears
would
never
let
my
eyes
close
their
spheres
for
very
joy
of
your
discourse
but
none
that
is
merely
mortal
can
live
without
the
death
of
sleep
so
the
gods
who
are
without
death
themselves
have
ordained
it
to
keep
the
memory
of
our
mortality
in
our
minds
while
we
experience
that
as
much
as
we
live
we
die
every
day
in
which
consideration
i
will
ascend
my
bed
which
i
have
nightly
watered
with
my
tears
since
he
that
was
the
joy
of
it
departed
for
that
bad
city
she
so
speaking
because
she
could
not
bring
her
lips
to
name
the
name
of
troy
so
much
hated
so
for
that
night
they
parted
penelope
to
her
bed
and
ulysses
to
his
son
and
to
the
armour
and
the
lances
in
the
hall
where
they
sat
up
all
night
cleaning
and
watching
by
the
armour
chapter
ten
the
madness
from
the
bow
of
the
the
conclusion
when
daylight
appeared
a
tumultuous
concourse
of
the
suitors
again
filled
the
hall
and
some
wondered
and
some
inquired
what
meant
that
glittering
store
of
armour
and
lances
which
lay
in
heaps
by
the
entry
of
the
door
and
to
all
that
asked
telemachus
made
reply
that
he
had
caused
them
to
be
taken
down
to
cleanse
them
of
the
rust
and
of
the
stain
which
they
had
contracted
by
lying
so
long
unused
even
ever
since
his
father
went
for
troy
and
with
that
answer
their
minds
were
easily
satisfied
so
to
their
feasting
and
vain
rioting
again
they
fell
ulysses
by
telemachus
order
had
a
seat
and
a
mess
assigned
him
in
the
doorway
and
he
had
his
eye
ever
on
the
lances
and
it
moved
gall
in
some
of
the
great
ones
there
present
to
have
their
feast
still
dulled
with
the
society
of
that
wretched
beggar
as
they
deemed
him
and
they
reviled
and
spurned
at
him
with
their
feet
only
there
was
one
philaetius
who
had
something
a
better
nature
than
the
rest
that
spake
kindly
to
him
and
had
his
age
in
respect
he
coming
up
to
ulysses
took
him
by
the
hand
with
a
kind
of
fear
as
if
touched
exceedingly
with
imagination
of
his
great
worth
and
said
thus
to
him
hail
father
stranger
my
brows
have
sweat
to
see
the
injuries
which
you
have
received
and
my
eyes
have
broke
forth
in
tears
when
i
have
only
thought
that
such
being
oftentimes
the
lot
of
worthiest
men
to
this
plight
ulysses
may
be
reduced
and
that
he
now
may
wander
from
place
to
place
as
you
do
for
such
who
are
compelled
by
need
to
range
here
and
there
and
have
no
firm
home
to
fix
their
feet
upon
god
keeps
them
in
this
earth
as
under
water
so
are
they
kept
down
and
depressed
and
a
dark
thread
is
sometimes
spun
in
the
fates
of
kings
at
this
bare
likening
of
the
beggar
to
ulysses
minerva
from
heaven
made
the
suitors
for
foolish
joy
to
go
mad
and
roused
them
to
such
a
laughter
as
would
never
stop
they
laughed
without
power
of
ceasing
their
eyes
stood
full
of
tears
for
violent
joys
but
fears
and
horrible
misgivings
succeeded
and
one
among
them
stood
up
and
prophesied
ah
wretches
he
said
what
madness
from
heaven
has
seized
you
that
you
can
laugh
see
you
not
that
your
meat
drops
blood
a
night
like
the
night
of
death
wraps
you
about
you
shriek
without
knowing
it
your
eyes
thrust
forth
tears
the
fixed
walls
and
the
beam
that
bears
the
whole
house
up
fall
blood
ghosts
choke
up
the
entry
full
is
the
hall
with
apparitions
of
murdered
men
under
your
feet
is
hell
the
sun
falls
from
heaven
and
it
is
midnight
at
noon
but
like
men
whom
the
gods
had
infatuated
to
their
destruction
they
mocked
at
his
fears
and
eurymachus
said
this
man
is
surely
mad
conduct
him
forth
into
the
set
him
in
the
light
for
he
dreams
that
is
night
within
the
house
but
theoclymenus
for
that
was
the
prophet
name
whom
minerva
had
graced
with
a
prophetic
spirit
that
he
foreseeing
might
avoid
the
destruction
which
awaited
them
answered
and
said
eurymachus
i
will
not
require
a
guide
of
thee
for
i
have
eyes
and
ears
the
use
of
both
my
feet
and
a
sane
mind
within
me
and
with
these
i
will
go
forth
of
the
doors
because
i
know
the
imminent
evils
which
await
all
you
that
stay
by
reason
of
this
poor
guest
who
is
a
favourite
with
all
the
gods
so
saying
he
turned
his
back
upon
those
inhospitable
men
and
went
away
home
and
never
returned
to
the
palace
these
words
which
he
spoke
were
not
unheard
by
telemachus
who
kept
still
his
eye
upon
his
father
expecting
fervently
when
he
would
give
the
sign
which
was
to
precede
the
slaughter
of
the
suitors
they
dreaming
of
no
such
thing
fell
sweetly
to
their
dinner
as
joying
in
the
great
store
of
banquet
which
was
heaped
in
full
tables
about
them
but
there
reigned
not
a
bitterer
banquet
planet
in
all
heaven
than
that
which
hung
over
them
this
day
by
secret
destination
of
minerva
there
was
a
bow
which
ulysses
left
when
he
went
for
troy
it
had
lain
by
since
that
time
out
of
use
and
unstrung
for
no
man
had
strength
to
draw
that
bow
save
ulysses
so
it
had
remained
as
a
monument
of
the
great
strength
of
its
master
this
bow
with
the
quiver
of
arrows
belonging
thereto
telemachus
had
brought
down
from
the
armoury
on
the
last
night
along
with
the
lances
and
now
minerva
intending
to
do
ulysses
an
honour
put
it
into
the
mind
of
telemachus
to
propose
to
the
suitors
to
try
who
was
strongest
to
draw
that
bow
and
he
promised
that
to
the
man
who
should
be
able
to
draw
that
bow
his
mother
should
be
given
in
marriage
wife
the
prize
to
him
who
should
bend
the
bow
of
ulysses
there
was
great
strife
and
emulation
stirred
up
among
the
suitors
at
those
words
of
the
prince
telemachus
and
to
grace
her
son
words
and
to
confirm
the
promise
which
he
had
made
penelope
came
and
showed
herself
that
day
to
the
suitors
and
minerva
made
her
that
she
appeared
never
so
comely
in
their
sight
as
that
day
and
they
were
inflamed
with
the
beholding
of
so
much
beauty
proposed
as
the
price
of
so
great
manhood
and
they
cried
out
that
if
all
those
heroes
who
sailed
to
colchis
for
the
rich
purchase
of
the
ram
had
seen
earth
richer
prize
penelope
they
would
not
have
made
their
voyage
but
would
have
vowed
their
valours
and
their
lives
to
her
for
she
was
at
all
parts
faultless
and
she
said
the
gods
have
taken
my
beauty
from
me
since
my
lord
went
for
troy
but
telemachus
willed
his
mother
to
depart
and
not
be
present
at
that
contest
for
he
said
it
may
be
some
rougher
strife
shall
chance
of
this
than
may
be
expedient
for
a
woman
to
witness
and
she
retired
she
and
her
maids
and
left
the
hall
then
the
bow
was
brought
into
the
midst
and
a
mark
was
set
up
by
prince
telemachus
and
lord
antinous
as
the
chief
among
the
suitors
had
the
first
offer
and
he
took
the
bow
and
fitting
an
arrow
to
the
string
he
strove
to
bend
it
but
not
with
all
his
might
and
main
could
he
once
draw
together
the
ends
of
that
tough
bow
and
when
he
found
how
vain
a
thing
it
was
to
endeavour
to
draw
ulysses
bow
he
desisted
blushing
for
shame
and
for
mere
anger
then
eurymachus
adventured
but
with
no
better
success
but
as
it
had
torn
the
hands
of
antinous
so
did
the
bow
tear
and
strain
his
hands
and
marred
his
delicate
fingers
yet
could
he
not
once
stir
the
string
then
called
he
to
the
attendants
to
bring
fat
and
unctuous
matter
which
melting
at
the
fire
he
dipped
the
bow
therein
thinking
to
supple
it
and
make
it
more
pliable
but
not
with
all
the
helps
of
art
could
he
succeed
in
making
it
to
move
after
him
liodes
and
amphinomus
and
polybus
and
eurynomus
and
polyctorides
essayed
their
strength
but
not
any
one
of
them
or
of
the
rest
of
those
aspiring
suitors
had
any
better
luck
yet
not
the
meanest
of
them
there
but
thought
himself
well
worthy
of
ulysses
wife
though
to
shoot
with
ulysses
bow
the
completest
champion
among
them
was
by
proof
found
too
feeble
then
ulysses
prayed
that
he
might
have
leave
to
try
and
immediately
a
clamour
was
raised
among
the
suitors
because
of
his
petition
and
they
scorned
and
swelled
with
rage
at
his
presumption
and
that
a
beggar
should
seek
to
contend
in
a
game
of
such
noble
mastery
but
telemachus
ordered
that
the
bow
should
be
given
him
and
that
he
should
have
leave
to
try
since
they
had
failed
for
he
said
the
bow
is
mine
to
give
or
to
withhold
and
none
durst
gainsay
the
prince
then
ulysses
gave
a
sign
to
his
son
and
he
commanded
the
doors
of
the
hall
to
be
made
fast
and
all
wondered
at
his
words
but
none
could
divine
the
cause
and
ulysses
took
the
bow
into
his
hands
and
before
he
essayed
to
bend
it
he
surveyed
it
at
all
parts
to
see
whether
by
long
lying
by
it
had
contracted
any
stiffness
which
hindered
the
drawing
and
as
he
was
busied
in
the
curious
surveying
of
his
bow
some
of
the
suitors
mocked
him
and
said
past
doubt
this
man
is
a
right
cunning
archer
and
knows
his
craft
well
see
how
he
turns
it
over
and
over
and
looks
into
it
as
if
he
could
see
through
the
wood
and
others
said
we
wish
some
one
would
tell
out
gold
into
our
laps
but
for
so
long
a
time
as
he
shall
be
in
drawing
of
that
string
but
when
he
had
spent
some
little
time
in
making
proof
of
the
bow
and
had
found
it
to
be
in
good
plight
like
as
a
harper
in
tuning
of
his
harp
draws
out
a
string
with
such
ease
or
much
more
did
ulysses
draw
to
the
head
the
string
of
his
own
tough
bow
and
in
letting
of
it
go
it
twanged
with
such
a
shrill
noise
as
a
swallow
makes
when
it
sings
through
the
air
which
so
much
amazed
the
suitors
that
their
colours
came
and
went
and
the
skies
gave
out
a
noise
of
thunder
which
at
heart
cheered
ulysses
for
he
knew
that
now
his
long
labours
by
the
disposal
of
the
fates
drew
to
an
end
then
fitted
he
an
arrow
to
the
bow
and
drawing
it
to
the
head
he
sent
it
right
to
the
mark
which
the
prince
had
set
up
which
done
he
said
to
telemachus
you
have
got
no
disgrace
yet
by
your
guest
for
i
have
struck
the
mark
i
shot
at
and
gave
myself
no
such
trouble
in
teasing
the
bow
with
fat
and
fire
as
these
men
did
but
have
made
proof
that
my
strength
is
not
impaired
nor
my
age
so
weak
and
contemptible
as
these
were
pleased
to
think
it
but
come
the
day
going
down
calls
us
to
supper
after
which
succeed
poem
and
harp
and
all
delights
which
use
to
crown
princely
banquetings
so
saying
he
beckoned
to
his
son
who
straight
girt
his
sword
to
his
side
and
took
one
of
the
lances
of
which
there
lay
great
store
from
the
armoury
in
his
hand
and
armed
at
all
points
advanced
towards
his
father
the
upper
rags
which
ulysses
wore
fell
from
his
shoulder
and
his
own
kingly
likeness
returned
when
he
rushed
to
the
great
hall
door
with
bow
and
quiver
full
of
shafts
which
down
at
his
feet
he
poured
and
in
bitter
words
presignified
his
deadly
intent
to
the
suitors
thus
far
he
said
this
contest
has
been
decided
harmless
now
for
us
there
rests
another
mark
harder
to
hit
but
which
my
hands
shall
essay
notwithstanding
if
phoebus
god
of
archers
be
pleased
to
give
me
the
mastery
with
that
he
let
fly
a
deadly
arrow
at
antinous
which
pierced
him
in
the
throat
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
lifting
a
cup
of
wine
to
his
mouth
amazement
seized
the
suitors
as
their
great
champion
fell
dead
and
they
raged
highly
against
ulysses
and
said
that
it
should
prove
the
dearest
shaft
which
he
ever
let
fly
for
he
had
slain
a
man
whose
like
breathed
not
in
any
part
of
the
kingdom
and
they
flew
to
their
arms
and
would
have
seized
the
lances
but
minerva
struck
them
with
dimness
of
sight
that
they
went
erring
up
and
down
the
hall
not
knowing
where
to
find
them
yet
so
infatuated
were
they
by
the
displeasure
of
heaven
that
they
did
not
see
the
imminent
peril
which
impended
over
them
but
every
man
believed
that
this
accident
had
happened
beside
the
intention
of
the
doer
fools
to
think
by
shutting
their
eyes
to
evade
destiny
or
that
any
other
cup
remained
for
them
but
that
which
their
great
antinous
had
tasted
then
ulysses
revealed
himself
to
all
in
that
presence
and
that
he
was
the
man
whom
they
held
to
be
dead
at
troy
whose
palace
they
had
usurped
whose
wife
in
his
lifetime
they
had
sought
in
impious
marriage
and
that
for
this
reason
destruction
was
come
upon
them
and
he
dealt
his
deadly
arrows
among
them
and
there
was
no
avoiding
him
nor
escaping
from
his
horrid
person
and
telemachus
by
his
side
plied
them
thick
with
those
murderous
lances
from
which
there
was
no
retreat
till
fear
itself
made
them
valiant
and
danger
gave
them
eyes
to
understand
the
peril
then
they
which
had
swords
drew
them
and
some
with
shields
that
could
find
them
and
some
with
tables
and
benches
snatched
up
in
haste
rose
in
a
mass
to
overwhelm
and
crush
those
two
yet
they
singly
bestirred
themselves
like
men
and
defended
themselves
against
that
great
host
and
through
tables
shields
and
all
right
through
the
arrows
of
ulysses
clove
and
the
irresistible
lances
of
telemachus
and
many
lay
dead
and
all
had
wounds
and
minerva
in
the
likeness
of
a
bird
sat
upon
the
beam
which
went
across
the
hall
clapping
her
wings
with
a
fearful
noise
and
sometimes
the
great
bird
would
fly
among
them
cuffing
at
the
swords
and
at
the
lances
and
up
and
down
the
hall
would
go
beating
her
wings
and
troubling
everything
that
it
was
frightful
to
behold
and
it
frayed
the
blood
from
the
cheeks
of
those
suitors
but
to
ulysses
and
his
son
she
appeared
in
her
own
divine
similitude
with
her
shield
a
goddess
armed
fighting
their
battles
nor
did
that
dreadful
pair
desist
till
they
had
laid
all
their
foes
at
their
feet
at
their
feet
they
lay
in
shoals
like
fishes
when
the
fishermen
break
up
their
nets
so
they
lay
gasping
and
sprawling
at
the
feet
of
ulysses
and
his
son
and
ulysses
remembered
the
prediction
of
tiresias
which
said
that
he
was
to
perish
by
his
own
guests
unless
he
slew
those
who
knew
him
not
illustration
in
a
mass
to
overwhelm
and
crush
those
then
certain
of
the
queen
household
went
up
and
told
penelope
what
had
happened
and
how
her
lord
ulysses
was
come
home
and
had
slain
the
suitors
but
she
gave
no
heed
to
their
words
but
thought
that
some
frenzy
possessed
them
or
that
they
mocked
her
for
it
is
the
property
of
such
extremes
of
sorrow
as
she
had
felt
not
to
believe
when
any
great
joy
cometh
and
she
rated
and
chid
them
exceedingly
for
troubling
her
but
they
the
more
persisted
in
their
asseverations
of
the
truth
of
what
they
had
affirmed
and
some
of
them
had
seen
the
slaughtered
bodies
of
the
suitors
dragged
forth
of
the
hall
and
they
said
that
poor
guest
whom
you
talked
with
last
night
was
ulysses
then
she
was
yet
more
fully
persuaded
that
they
mocked
her
and
she
wept
but
they
said
this
thing
is
true
which
we
have
told
we
sat
within
in
an
inner
room
in
the
palace
and
the
doors
of
the
hall
were
shut
on
us
but
we
heard
the
cries
and
the
groans
of
the
men
that
were
killed
but
saw
nothing
till
at
length
your
son
called
to
us
to
come
in
and
entering
we
saw
ulysses
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
slaughtered
but
she
persisting
in
her
unbelief
said
that
it
was
some
god
which
had
deceived
them
to
think
it
was
the
person
of
ulysses
by
this
time
telemachus
and
his
father
had
cleansed
their
hands
from
the
slaughter
and
were
come
to
where
the
queen
was
talking
with
those
of
her
household
and
when
she
saw
ulysses
she
stood
motionless
and
had
no
power
to
speak
sudden
surprise
and
joy
and
fear
and
many
passions
so
strove
within
her
sometimes
she
was
clear
that
it
was
her
husband
that
she
saw
and
sometimes
the
alteration
which
twenty
years
had
made
in
his
person
yet
that
was
not
much
perplexed
her
that
she
knew
not
what
to
think
and
for
joy
she
could
not
believe
and
yet
for
joy
she
would
not
but
believe
and
above
all
that
sudden
change
from
a
beggar
to
a
king
troubled
her
and
wrought
uneasy
scruples
in
her
mind
but
telemachus
seeing
her
strangeness
blamed
her
and
called
her
an
ungentle
and
tyrannous
mother
and
said
that
she
showed
a
too
great
curiousness
of
modesty
to
abstain
from
embracing
his
father
and
to
have
doubts
of
his
person
when
to
all
present
it
was
evident
that
he
was
the
very
real
and
true
ulysses
then
she
mistrusted
no
longer
but
ran
and
fell
upon
ulysses
neck
and
said
let
not
my
husband
be
angry
that
i
held
off
so
long
with
strange
delays
it
is
the
gods
who
severing
us
for
so
long
time
have
caused
this
unseemly
distance
in
me
if
menelaus
wife
had
used
half
my
caution
she
would
never
have
taken
so
freely
to
a
stranger
bed
and
she
might
have
spared
us
all
these
plagues
which
have
come
upon
us
through
her
shameless
deed
these
words
with
which
penelope
excused
herself
wrought
more
affection
in
ulysses
than
if
upon
a
first
sight
she
had
given
up
herself
implicitly
to
his
embraces
and
he
wept
for
joy
to
possess
a
wife
so
discreet
so
answering
to
his
own
staid
mind
that
had
a
depth
of
wit
proportioned
to
his
own
and
one
that
held
chaste
virtue
at
so
high
a
price
and
he
thought
the
possession
of
such
a
one
cheaply
purchased
with
the
loss
of
all
circe
delights
and
calypso
immortality
of
joys
and
his
long
labours
and
his
severe
sufferings
past
seemed
as
nothing
now
they
were
crowned
with
the
enjoyment
of
his
virtuous
and
true
wife
penelope
and
as
sad
men
at
sea
whose
ship
has
gone
to
pieces
nigh
shore
swimming
for
their
lives
all
drenched
in
foam
and
brine
crawl
up
to
some
poor
patch
of
land
which
they
take
possession
of
with
as
great
a
joy
as
if
they
had
the
world
given
them
in
fee
with
such
delight
did
this
chaste
wife
cling
to
her
lord
restored
till
the
dark
night
fast
coming
on
reminded
her
of
that
more
intimate
and
happy
union
when
in
her
bed
she
should
once
again
clasp
a
living
ulysses
so
from
that
time
the
land
had
rest
from
the
suitors
and
the
happy
ithacans
with
songs
and
solemn
sacrifices
of
praise
to
the
gods
celebrated
the
return
of
ulysses
for
he
that
had
been
so
long
absent
was
returned
to
wreak
the
evil
upon
the
heads
of
the
doers
in
the
place
where
they
had
done
the
evil
there
wreaked
he
his
vengeance
upon
them
