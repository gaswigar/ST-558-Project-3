lady
francis
lord
francis
etchingham
a
man
of
fifty
of
the
middle
height
rather
bald
with
an
amiable
weak
face
he
is
a
person
anxious
to
do
his
best
in
all
things
and
to
all
people
so
long
as
he
is
not
bored
he
wants
everything
to
go
smoothly
he
has
a
comfortable
idea
of
his
own
capacity
reduced
circumstances
have
drawn
him
into
affairs
and
he
regards
himself
as
a
fine
man
of
lady
francis
a
handsome
and
woman
of
the
same
age
as
her
husband
with
dyed
red
hair
she
has
a
massive
almost
an
imposing
presence
and
she
is
admirably
gowned
she
treats
her
husband
with
scorn
aware
of
his
foibles
but
amused
rather
than
annoyed
by
them
when
the
curtain
francis
etchingham
a
prey
to
the
liveliest
vexation
he
is
walking
nervously
across
the
room
while
his
wife
with
a
thin
smile
stands
quietly
watching
him
with
a
gesture
of
irritation
he
flings
himself
into
a
etchingham
why
the
dickens
didn
t
you
tell
me
last
night
angela
lady
francis
i
had
no
wish
to
disturb
my
night
s
rest
etchingham
upon
my
soul
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
it
s
incomprehensible
to
me
that
you
should
have
slept
like
a
top
i
couldn
t
have
closed
my
eyes
the
whole
night
lady
francis
i
know
and
you
would
have
taken
excellent
care
that
i
shouldn
t
close
mine
either
etchingham
i
should
have
thought
i
had
enough
to
do
without
being
pestered
with
a
foolish
woman
s
matrimonial
difficulties
lady
francis
a
you
really
have
a
very
detached
way
of
looking
at
things
frank
no
one
would
imagine
to
hear
you
speak
that
the
foolish
woman
in
question
was
your
daughter
etchingham
really
angela
i
must
beg
you
not
to
make
this
a
subject
of
flippancy
lady
francis
well
what
do
you
propose
to
do
etchingham
out
of
his
do
what
do
you
expect
me
to
do
you
tell
me
that
kate
came
home
at
twelve
o
clock
last
night
without
a
stitch
of
clothing
lady
francis
my
dear
if
i
told
you
that
i
was
most
unwarrantably
distorting
the
truth
etchingham
correcting
in
a
ball
dress
with
an
opera
cloak
on
without
her
luggage
without
even
a
and
informs
you
that
she
s
left
her
husband
it
s
absurd
lady
francis
quite
absurd
and
so
unnecessarily
dramatic
etchingham
and
when
s
she
going
home
lady
francis
she
assures
me
that
she
s
not
going
home
etchingham
beside
she
s
not
going
to
stay
here
lady
francis
those
are
her
plans
at
the
moment
etchingham
and
george
lady
francis
well
etchingham
you
don
t
suppose
her
husband
s
going
to
put
up
with
this
nonsense
has
he
made
no
sign
lady
francis
ten
minutes
after
she
arrived
he
sent
a
messenger
boy
with
a
toothbrush
etchingham
why
a
toothbrush
lady
francis
i
don
t
know
presumably
to
brush
her
teeth
etchingham
well
that
shows
he
doesn
t
look
upon
the
matter
as
serious
of
course
it
was
a
whim
on
kate
s
part
luckily
he
s
coming
here
this
morning
lady
francis
is
he
etchingham
yes
he
promised
to
fetch
me
in
his
car
we
re
going
to
drive
down
to
the
city
together
i
ll
bring
him
in
and
meanwhile
you
can
talk
to
kate
i
dare
say
she
s
thought
better
of
it
already
it
only
wants
a
little
tact
and
we
can
settle
the
whole
thing
george
is
clever
enough
to
have
given
some
plausible
explanation
to
the
servants
lady
francis
are
you
really
under
the
impression
things
are
going
to
pass
off
in
that
way
etchingham
why
not
lady
francis
they
say
it
s
a
wise
man
who
knows
his
own
father
but
it
s
apparently
a
wiser
man
still
who
knows
his
own
daughter
etchingham
angela
for
goodness
sake
don
t
try
to
be
bright
and
amusing
lady
francis
do
you
know
so
little
of
kate
as
to
imagine
she
would
have
taken
a
step
of
this
kind
without
having
quite
made
up
her
mind
etchingham
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
think
kate
will
refuse
to
go
back
to
her
husband
lady
francis
i
do
etchingham
but
what
reasons
does
she
give
why
did
she
say
she
left
him
lady
francis
she
gave
no
reasons
she
merely
stated
the
fact
and
asked
if
i
could
put
her
up
etchingham
well
she
must
go
back
to
her
husband
lady
francis
if
it
were
the
most
innocent
why
etchingham
because
a
woman
s
place
is
by
her
husband
s
side
angela
you
know
just
as
well
as
i
do
that
i
can
t
afford
to
quarrel
with
george
winter
i
m
chairman
of
half
a
dozen
of
his
companies
the
position
would
be
intolerable
i
should
be
expected
to
take
kate
s
side
if
she
were
right
or
wrong
lady
francis
i
suppose
you
owe
him
money
etchingham
no
not
exactly
lady
francis
ah
a
shrewd
look
at
him
and
a
and
how
much
is
it
that
you
don
t
exactly
owe
him
etchingham
we
re
mixed
up
together
in
any
number
of
business
undertakings
and
naturally
we
have
a
sort
of
running
account
if
we
settled
up
i
dare
say
i
should
have
to
find
something
like
fifteen
thousand
pounds
lady
francis
good
heavens
i
thought
you
d
been
making
money
etchingham
yes
i
did
but
the
fact
is
we
ve
been
very
badly
hit
lately
practically
all
our
interests
are
in
central
america
and
we
couldn
t
foresee
that
there
d
be
a
revolution
there
lady
francis
the
possibility
might
have
crossed
your
mind
etchingham
oh
i
knew
you
d
blame
me
and
i
suppose
you
ll
blame
me
because
a
confounded
earthquake
smashed
up
one
of
our
railways
lady
francis
and
how
d
you
propose
to
raise
fifteen
thousand
pounds
etchingham
that
s
just
it
it
would
be
devilish
awkward
and
george
is
in
a
confounded
tight
place
too
lady
francis
you
d
better
talk
to
kate
i
ll
send
for
her
touches
a
bell
and
gives
her
order
down
a
speaking
lady
francis
ask
winter
to
be
good
enough
to
come
to
the
drawing
room
etchingham
you
must
talk
to
her
seriously
angela
you
must
tell
her
that
her
behaviour
is
outrageous
lady
francis
a
no
my
dear
you
are
going
to
talk
to
her
catherine
winter
in
she
is
a
graceful
woman
with
a
strong
passionate
face
and
her
expression
rather
tired
but
and
resolute
suggests
that
she
has
endured
great
trouble
and
is
now
making
a
desperate
effort
to
escape
she
is
very
simply
dressed
and
wears
no
jewellery
but
her
wedding
catherine
father
goes
up
lord
francis
kisses
his
etchingham
elaborate
be
so
good
as
to
sit
down
catherine
catherine
with
her
mother
a
glance
of
faint
amusement
and
takes
a
etchingham
a
fine
assumption
of
paternal
i
want
to
talk
to
you
your
mother
and
i
have
sent
for
you
now
what
does
all
this
mean
it
s
ridiculous
nonsense
you
re
surely
old
enough
to
have
learnt
a
little
catherine
i
ve
shown
a
good
deal
of
during
the
four
years
of
my
married
life
father
i
was
afraid
it
was
growing
into
a
habit
etchingham
am
i
to
understand
that
what
your
mother
tells
me
is
true
catherine
i
lived
with
george
as
long
as
i
could
i
put
up
with
more
than
any
woman
i
know
would
have
done
but
there
are
some
things
no
one
should
suffer
who
has
any
etchingham
you
ve
never
complained
before
of
george
s
behaviour
catherine
no
etchingham
why
have
you
never
said
a
word
to
your
mother
about
it
i
can
t
imagine
why
you
shouldn
t
get
on
with
george
i
don
t
suppose
you
ve
ever
expressed
a
whim
that
he
hasn
t
gratified
your
allowance
is
princely
your
pearls
are
the
envy
of
every
woman
in
london
catherine
oh
yes
he
s
generous
my
pearls
have
been
a
splendid
advertisement
etchingham
the
second
sentence
and
pouncing
on
the
then
what
have
you
got
to
complain
of
catherine
i
dare
say
my
mother
knows
what
half
london
is
chattering
about
etchingham
well
angela
lady
francis
oh
my
dear
i
hoped
it
was
idle
gossip
a
man
as
much
in
the
public
eye
as
george
winter
the
most
prominent
financier
of
the
moment
is
certain
to
be
talked
about
etchingham
i
suppose
he
s
been
flirting
with
two
or
three
pretty
women
lady
francis
i
understand
things
are
supposed
to
have
gone
rather
further
than
that
etchingham
that
s
the
kind
of
thing
a
tactful
woman
must
close
her
eyes
to
you
re
a
woman
of
the
world
kate
you
know
what
men
are
you
must
extend
a
certain
degree
of
licence
to
a
man
of
george
winter
s
temperament
catherine
you
don
t
understand
father
i
bore
my
life
till
i
couldn
t
bear
it
any
longer
i
m
not
the
sort
of
woman
to
make
scenes
i
held
my
tongue
i
closed
my
eyes
till
something
happened
which
i
couldn
t
endure
i
ve
left
him
fully
decided
to
divorce
him
nothing
that
you
can
say
will
move
me
etchingham
but
you
can
t
divorce
him
you
ve
accused
him
of
nothing
but
infidelity
you
can
t
be
so
ignorant
of
the
law
catherine
i
m
not
at
all
ignorant
of
the
law
i
assure
you
that
he
has
complied
fully
with
all
the
conditions
which
are
needful
lady
francis
kate
catherine
please
don
t
ask
me
i
feel
that
my
whole
soul
is
foul
with
etchingham
well
of
course
there
are
always
two
sides
to
every
question
catherine
oh
father
you
re
not
going
to
tell
me
that
that
too
is
usual
in
polite
society
for
a
man
to
oh
gives
a
gesture
and
a
cry
of
lady
francis
i
wonder
if
you
d
go
and
read
your
frank
i
should
like
to
talk
to
katie
alone
etchingham
a
look
from
his
wife
to
his
eh
very
well
perhaps
you
can
do
something
with
her
tell
her
what
it
means
if
she
persists
i
suppose
i
shall
find
the
in
the
library
goes
lady
francis
a
your
father
has
such
a
power
of
delusion
he
never
looks
at
anything
but
the
but
he
s
quite
convinced
that
he
reads
nothing
but
the
catherine
oh
mother
you
ll
stand
by
me
won
t
you
you
know
what
i
ve
gone
through
if
you
care
for
me
at
all
you
must
have
some
pity
lady
francis
at
her
coolly
she
is
quite
unmoved
by
the
vehemence
of
the
appeal
she
pauses
for
a
moment
before
lady
francis
why
have
you
chosen
this
particular
moment
to
leave
your
husband
catherine
there
are
limits
to
human
endurance
lady
francis
you
ve
lived
a
good
deal
apart
like
civilized
people
you
ve
made
the
best
of
a
mutual
want
of
sympathy
i
should
have
thought
george
interfered
with
you
very
little
i
have
an
idea
that
no
woman
would
care
to
undergo
the
inconvenience
of
proceedings
for
divorce
without
a
very
good
reason
you
ve
got
a
peculiarly
fastidious
taste
katie
it
must
be
something
rather
out
of
the
way
that
induces
you
to
expose
your
private
life
to
all
and
sundry
catherine
it
s
merely
a
choice
of
ignominies
lady
francis
an
instant
then
raps
out
the
question
lady
francis
are
you
in
love
catherine
you
have
no
right
to
ask
me
that
mother
lady
francis
a
slight
your
indignation
is
almost
an
answer
in
itself
isn
t
it
i
suppose
you
want
to
marry
catherine
not
answer
she
takes
a
step
or
two
lady
francis
well
catherine
i
ve
got
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
lady
francis
in
that
case
i
should
have
thought
you
had
nothing
to
conceal
catherine
i
haven
t
when
i
thought
that
everything
was
over
for
me
and
that
life
was
meaningless
i
found
it
was
only
just
beginning
and
i
thanked
god
for
all
i
d
gone
through
because
perhaps
it
made
me
less
unfit
for
the
great
love
that
descended
upon
me
lady
francis
it
s
robert
colby
isn
t
it
catherine
yes
lady
francis
and
you
ve
made
your
arrangements
i
suppose
to
be
married
as
soon
as
the
decree
is
made
absolute
catherine
we
haven
t
discussed
the
matter
lady
francis
but
still
i
may
take
it
that
is
the
intention
catherine
yes
lady
francis
your
father
wishes
me
to
tell
you
that
if
you
quarrel
with
george
it
will
ruin
him
he
could
hardly
keep
the
position
that
george
has
given
him
on
his
various
boards
catherine
you
will
be
no
worse
off
than
before
i
married
lady
francis
except
that
it
appears
your
father
owes
george
fifteen
thousand
pounds
catherine
do
you
want
to
cheat
me
again
out
of
the
little
happiness
that
seems
in
store
for
me
lady
francis
i
want
you
to
do
what
is
right
in
your
own
eyes
catherine
how
can
you
be
so
cruel
george
winter
the
may
i
come
in
enters
francis
etchingham
george
winter
a
man
of
powerful
build
with
fine
hair
and
fine
eyes
he
wears
a
short
red
beard
he
is
inclined
to
corpulence
but
bears
himself
with
an
attractive
swagger
he
is
a
jovial
bland
fellow
he
appears
to
be
the
person
in
the
world
and
his
great
astuteness
suggests
itself
only
now
and
then
in
a
look
of
his
eyes
he
has
admirable
control
over
an
execrable
catherine
round
with
a
startled
cry
at
the
sound
of
her
husband
s
catherine
george
george
winter
my
dear
look
pleased
to
see
me
it
s
only
decent
catherine
it
s
infamous
that
you
should
come
here
if
you
had
any
decent
feeling
george
winter
my
dear
child
i
had
a
business
engagement
with
your
father
it
s
unreasonable
to
expect
me
not
to
keep
it
because
you
have
temporarily
abandoned
the
conjugal
roof
catherine
her
you
might
have
warned
me
etchingham
my
dear
i
was
hoping
that
after
a
talk
with
your
mother
you
d
have
catherine
what
can
i
do
to
show
you
that
i
ve
made
up
my
mind
for
good
and
all
george
winter
even
after
one
s
made
up
one
s
mind
it
s
not
too
late
to
listen
to
reason
lady
francis
i
think
for
all
our
sakes
you
should
listen
to
anything
that
george
has
to
say
catherine
george
winter
do
you
understand
what
my
mother
means
george
winter
a
little
i
dimly
suspect
catherine
my
father
owes
you
a
lot
of
money
he
s
chairman
of
half
your
companies
he
thinks
that
if
i
divorce
you
he
ll
have
to
pay
that
money
george
winter
i
m
sure
his
sense
of
delicacy
would
prevent
him
from
remaining
in
my
debt
catherine
and
you
ll
make
him
resign
his
directorships
george
winter
his
tongue
in
his
i
know
him
well
enough
to
feel
certain
that
he
would
never
wish
to
retain
them
catherine
oh
it
s
vile
george
winter
or
is
it
common
sense
is
a
moment
s
pause
and
george
winter
it
is
with
great
george
winter
now
look
here
kate
listen
to
me
carefully
you
know
that
all
our
interests
are
in
central
america
the
lewishams
had
it
all
their
own
way
out
there
till
i
came
along
they
owned
the
railways
and
the
mines
and
the
trams
everything
that
was
worth
having
well
i
knew
i
couldn
t
oust
them
but
i
thought
i
could
make
them
take
me
in
i
ve
been
fighting
them
tooth
and
nail
for
ten
years
they
ve
done
all
they
could
to
smash
me
by
fair
means
and
foul
but
they
haven
t
succeeded
and
now
i
m
in
sight
of
my
goal
i
can
force
them
to
come
to
terms
catherine
all
this
is
nothing
to
me
george
winter
the
lewishams
got
on
to
a
big
thing
a
mine
called
the
campo
del
oro
but
that
earthquake
the
other
day
queered
their
pitch
and
they
offered
bills
when
hard
cash
was
the
only
thing
to
do
the
trick
i
thought
that
what
was
good
enough
for
the
lewishams
was
good
enough
for
me
i
knew
that
if
i
could
get
it
they
d
have
to
take
me
in
i
had
two
hours
to
think
it
over
i
found
the
cash
and
bought
the
mine
last
week
catherine
it
doesn
t
interest
me
george
winter
it
will
i
sent
macdonald
out
there
etchingham
macdonald
is
george
s
expert
he
s
the
soundest
man
in
the
profession
george
winter
and
straight
straight
as
a
die
i
m
expecting
his
report
every
day
he
may
cable
me
at
any
moment
then
i
shall
get
to
work
i
m
going
to
float
the
mine
as
a
company
with
a
capital
of
half
a
million
your
father
will
be
chairman
and
he
ought
to
make
close
on
fifty
thousand
out
of
it
for
a
reason
i
needn
t
tell
you
we
can
t
afford
to
wait
we
must
have
ready
money
and
that
means
floating
the
company
at
once
my
only
chance
is
in
middlepool
where
three
parts
of
my
backing
have
come
from
before
we
shall
soon
be
in
the
middle
of
a
general
election
and
you
know
how
uncertain
my
seat
in
middlepool
is
i
keep
it
only
by
my
personal
popularity
i
m
at
the
mercy
of
the
nonconformists
and
if
there
s
talk
of
a
divorce
it
s
all
with
me
they
ll
make
me
retire
before
the
election
and
if
that
happens
the
new
company
won
t
stand
a
dog
s
chance
lady
francis
why
george
winter
because
with
the
general
public
nervous
i
shall
have
to
depend
on
middlepool
and
there
i
can
only
float
it
on
my
personal
character
catherine
i
m
afraid
you
ll
think
it
very
selfish
but
i
haven
t
any
more
power
of
in
me
george
winter
if
the
campo
del
oro
is
a
failure
it
ll
knock
down
all
the
other
companies
i
m
connected
with
the
lewishams
will
seize
the
opportunity
to
make
a
raid
on
me
i
m
standing
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
and
anyone
who
cares
to
give
me
a
shove
will
send
me
over
it
ll
mean
your
father
s
ruin
and
mine
i
dare
say
you
don
t
mind
that
but
it
ll
also
mean
the
ruin
of
thousands
of
poor
investors
all
over
the
country
of
the
population
of
middlepool
will
lose
their
savings
catherine
you
ve
lied
to
me
so
often
george
george
winter
i
can
show
you
by
plain
figures
that
every
word
i
say
is
true
catherine
i
haven
t
much
sympathy
with
the
gamblers
who
want
to
make
money
without
working
for
it
if
they
lose
it
s
their
own
look
out
is
a
george
winter
at
her
and
nods
to
george
winter
etchingham
i
think
you
d
better
go
now
the
rest
of
our
conversation
doesn
t
need
any
listeners
catherine
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
you
george
winter
don
t
be
a
damned
fool
it
s
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
me
and
d
you
think
i
m
going
to
please
lady
francis
lady
francis
of
course
we
ll
leave
you
come
frank
lady
francis
her
husband
go
george
winter
a
twinkle
in
his
i
don
t
think
your
elopement
receives
the
unqualified
approval
of
your
parents
catherine
d
you
want
to
repeat
that
odious
scene
of
last
night
surely
we
said
all
that
we
had
to
say
to
one
another
george
winter
his
you
know
i
wouldn
t
have
played
the
fool
with
other
women
if
you
hadn
t
shown
me
very
clearly
that
you
didn
t
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
me
catherine
i
would
rather
not
discuss
that
george
winter
a
after
all
it
isn
t
as
if
i
cared
a
tinker
s
cuss
for
the
whole
lot
of
them
catherine
and
you
think
that
makes
it
any
better
i
think
i
could
have
forgiven
you
if
you
d
had
any
love
for
those
wretched
women
but
it
wasn
t
even
that
you
exposed
me
to
all
that
humiliation
merely
to
gratify
your
vanity
when
i
ve
seen
how
you
ve
treated
those
women
i
even
i
have
been
sorry
for
them
george
winter
if
you
like
i
ll
give
you
my
solemn
word
of
honour
that
you
shall
have
no
cause
to
complain
in
future
catherine
it
s
too
late
you
ve
given
me
my
chance
of
freedom
and
i
mean
to
take
it
george
winter
you
re
not
keeping
your
part
of
the
bargain
catherine
what
d
you
mean
george
winter
you
didn
t
marry
me
because
you
were
in
love
with
me
catherine
that
s
not
true
george
winter
a
think
catherine
a
year
ago
i
would
have
said
again
that
it
wasn
t
true
i
didn
t
know
what
love
was
george
winter
you
married
me
because
i
was
rich
catherine
no
no
george
winter
i
d
just
won
a
seat
that
they
d
given
me
because
they
thought
i
hadn
t
a
chance
i
won
it
off
my
own
bat
because
i
imposed
myself
on
middlepool
and
forced
them
to
vote
for
me
i
was
in
the
public
eye
i
was
a
power
already
the
world
seemed
at
my
feet
catherine
all
that
s
very
harmless
you
flattered
me
the
life
you
offered
me
seemed
so
large
so
full
and
i
was
very
young
i
was
dazzled
by
your
brilliancy
and
your
success
i
mistook
it
for
love
george
winter
and
i
married
you
because
i
wanted
a
wife
you
happened
to
have
an
uncle
who
s
a
duke
and
aristocratic
connexions
are
devilish
useful
in
england
to
a
radical
politician
catherine
oh
yes
i
found
out
soon
enough
why
you
married
me
george
winter
it
was
a
business
arrangement
on
both
sides
and
you
ve
had
your
full
share
of
the
profits
catherine
oh
how
can
you
george
winter
you
d
always
lived
in
a
pokey
way
and
i
gave
you
magnificence
i
ve
kept
even
the
spirit
of
my
part
of
the
bargain
your
father
wasn
t
mentioned
in
the
settlements
but
every
stick
of
furniture
in
this
house
has
been
bought
with
my
money
the
very
clothes
on
your
mother
s
back
are
paid
for
by
me
catherine
that
s
not
true
george
winter
you
don
t
think
your
father
is
worth
the
money
i
give
him
he
s
as
incompetent
as
all
the
rest
of
these
damned
fools
who
come
from
the
and
think
they
can
make
money
in
the
city
the
nincompoop
thinks
himself
a
financial
authority
the
charwoman
of
a
could
give
him
points
catherine
he
has
his
name
and
his
position
george
winter
nowadays
even
a
country
curate
will
fight
shy
of
a
title
on
a
prospectus
the
salaries
he
gets
are
merely
payments
for
you
catherine
oh
you
ve
said
all
this
so
often
for
years
you
ve
bullied
me
with
your
money
i
was
such
a
fool
because
you
said
it
was
dishonest
of
me
to
go
rather
than
that
even
you
should
have
the
smallest
cause
to
blame
me
i
bore
everything
i
clenched
my
hands
and
suffered
george
winter
a
in
a
diamond
tiara
and
a
paquin
dress
catherine
i
thought
i
should
have
the
strength
to
suffer
to
the
end
but
i
haven
t
if
you
bought
an
article
and
it
hasn
t
turned
out
worth
the
money
you
gave
for
it
that
s
your
look
out
you
see
you
ve
taught
me
something
after
all
very
short
george
winter
up
his
mind
to
try
george
winter
now
look
here
i
m
willing
to
meet
you
i
don
t
ask
you
to
come
back
to
me
you
can
live
as
you
like
and
where
you
like
i
ll
give
you
five
thousand
a
year
your
father
can
keep
his
directorships
the
only
thing
i
ask
is
that
you
shouldn
t
apply
for
a
divorce
and
that
you
should
appear
with
me
at
certain
public
functions
catherine
i
want
to
be
free
i
ve
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
lies
and
hypocrisy
till
i
can
hardly
breathe
your
good
nature
is
merely
a
pose
your
generosity
is
merely
an
advertisement
you
care
for
nothing
but
your
own
and
i
want
to
be
rid
of
the
horrible
feeling
that
all
sorts
of
shady
things
are
going
on
around
me
that
i
don
t
know
george
winter
what
d
you
mean
catherine
i
know
that
you
re
not
honest
a
cry
of
george
winter
her
by
the
shoulders
violently
his
passion
for
the
moment
is
george
winter
what
d
you
mean
what
d
you
mean
what
d
you
mean
catherine
you
re
hurting
me
george
winter
his
rage
hardly
able
to
damn
you
how
dare
you
say
that
to
me
catherine
let
me
go
george
winter
why
don
t
you
answer
what
d
you
mean
catherine
herself
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
mean
i
know
that
if
the
occasion
arose
you
wouldn
t
hesitate
to
steal
george
winter
a
laugh
of
is
that
all
catherine
for
years
i
ve
been
tortured
by
the
horror
of
it
each
pearl
you
ve
given
me
and
you
ve
thrust
them
upon
me
i
ve
asked
myself
if
it
was
honestly
come
by
and
that
s
why
i
want
to
escape
from
you
not
only
because
you
ve
been
odiously
cruel
to
me
even
now
when
you
re
trying
to
persuade
me
to
return
to
you
and
because
you
ve
flaunted
before
me
one
vulgar
intrigue
after
another
but
because
i
feel
that
all
this
wealth
rests
on
lying
and
swindling
and
roguery
george
winter
well
you
must
confess
that
so
far
i
ve
been
eminently
successful
in
not
getting
found
out
catherine
no
notice
of
his
and
now
surely
you
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
me
george
winter
a
bland
my
dear
knowing
how
important
it
is
to
me
that
you
should
return
to
the
conjugal
roof
you
don
t
imagine
i
have
come
without
some
means
to
persuade
you
catherine
i
assure
you
you
re
wasting
your
time
you
ve
always
told
me
it
was
valuable
george
winter
his
most
delightful
you
seem
to
be
under
the
delusion
it
rests
with
you
to
make
conditions
catherine
i
make
no
conditions
i
merely
announce
my
decision
george
winter
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
quietly
smoothing
it
out
on
a
i
ve
never
suffered
from
that
form
of
snobbishness
which
makes
many
men
hurl
their
origin
in
the
face
of
a
british
public
only
too
anxious
to
pretend
it
thinks
them
the
scions
of
a
noble
house
but
i
have
never
concealed
from
you
that
mine
was
humble
catherine
what
is
that
paper
george
winter
the
that
is
one
of
the
pills
you
had
to
swallow
when
i
married
you
and
your
excellent
but
impoverished
family
i
started
life
with
neither
friend
nor
money
but
with
exceptionally
fine
parts
i
soon
discovered
that
the
simplest
way
to
succeed
is
by
blackmail
it
is
astonishing
how
many
men
keep
a
skeleton
in
their
cupboards
if
you
only
get
a
sight
of
those
discreditable
bones
you
can
often
make
a
whole
family
your
bosom
friends
i
m
not
boring
you
am
i
catherine
you
re
torturing
me
george
winter
this
is
a
copy
of
a
letter
which
you
may
remember
the
original
was
so
crumpled
that
i
can
t
help
thinking
you
were
romantic
enough
to
sleep
with
it
under
your
pillow
it
begins
my
very
dear
friend
catherine
how
did
you
get
that
george
winter
i
can
never
understand
why
people
are
such
fools
as
to
write
i
never
do
i
only
send
telegrams
catherine
flashing
you
didn
t
go
to
my
george
winter
i
did
indeed
catherine
at
the
on
her
you
broke
it
open
george
winter
when
i
made
you
a
present
of
your
i
kept
the
duplicate
key
in
case
you
lost
yours
catherine
it
s
infamous
it
s
it
s
just
like
you
george
winter
why
on
earth
were
you
so
incautious
as
to
leave
it
behind
catherine
i
thought
i
could
trust
you
it
never
struck
me
that
you
d
pry
into
my
private
papers
george
winter
a
nonsense
you
were
so
taken
with
the
dramatic
gesture
of
leaving
the
house
in
a
pink
satin
opera
cloak
that
you
forgot
all
about
it
catherine
there
s
nothing
in
any
of
my
letters
that
i
m
ashamed
of
george
winter
would
you
like
to
look
at
this
one
catherine
to
take
i
know
that
there
can
be
absolutely
no
harm
in
it
george
winter
i
wonder
what
a
clever
counsel
would
make
of
it
i
can
imagine
it
read
in
such
a
manner
that
those
vague
words
should
gather
form
and
substance
a
little
irony
a
grotesque
emphasis
here
and
there
and
i
can
see
the
junior
bar
rolling
with
laughter
i
don
t
imagine
a
parliamentary
light
like
your
friend
robert
colby
would
take
ridicule
very
well
it
s
only
by
his
entire
lack
of
humour
that
he
s
risen
to
the
exalted
position
he
now
adorns
catherine
what
d
you
mean
george
george
winter
my
dear
i
m
going
to
bring
a
counter
petition
that
s
all
you
want
to
wash
your
dirty
linen
in
public
let
s
have
an
entire
spring
cleaning
catherine
oh
my
dear
george
if
you
only
knew
how
indifferent
i
am
to
such
a
threat
we
haven
t
done
anything
with
which
we
can
reproach
ourselves
george
winter
you
astonish
me
my
dear
kate
surely
it
can
t
have
slipped
your
memory
that
robert
colby
snatching
a
brief
and
holiday
from
affairs
of
state
made
a
tour
of
north
italy
last
easter
and
you
accompanied
him
catherine
that
s
not
true
you
know
it
s
not
true
i
went
with
barbara
herbert
george
winter
with
a
twinkle
in
his
and
a
maid
it
s
always
a
little
unsafe
to
trust
maids
especially
scotch
maids
with
strongly
religious
principles
catherine
what
have
you
been
doing
george
winter
a
paper
out
of
his
here
is
another
interesting
little
document
that
i
ve
been
at
some
pains
to
acquire
being
alas
aware
that
the
wife
of
my
bosom
might
turn
troublesome
one
day
or
another
i
thought
it
safe
to
have
a
weapon
in
my
hand
for
future
use
it
is
a
list
of
the
hotels
at
which
you
stayed
shall
i
read
it
to
you
catherine
if
you
choose
george
winter
at
milan
you
stayed
at
the
and
robert
colby
at
the
catherine
damning
isn
t
it
george
winter
but
perhaps
finding
the
noisy
and
trusting
in
robert
colby
s
better
judgment
at
venice
you
both
stayed
at
the
catherine
a
shrug
of
the
where
else
should
one
stay
george
winter
i
find
in
my
baedeker
that
there
are
hotels
in
venice
but
i
daresay
it
was
very
natural
that
you
should
both
hit
upon
the
and
you
took
the
precaution
of
arriving
twenty
hours
after
him
but
at
ravenna
flinging
prudence
to
the
winds
you
arrived
on
the
same
day
by
the
same
train
and
you
put
up
at
the
same
hotel
catherine
there
is
only
one
george
winter
you
had
rooms
seventeen
and
eighteen
and
barbara
herbert
had
room
five
catherine
there
was
only
one
vacant
room
on
the
first
floor
and
of
course
i
insisted
that
barbara
should
take
it
george
winter
unselfish
in
the
extreme
and
just
like
you
my
dear
but
don
t
you
think
it
was
a
little
indiscreet
catherine
we
had
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
and
therefore
we
had
nothing
to
fear
george
winter
i
ve
often
thought
that
was
the
greatest
drawback
of
innocence
it
makes
one
so
devilish
imprudent
catherine
i
went
to
italy
with
your
express
consent
i
wrote
and
told
you
that
i
d
met
robert
colby
chance
threw
us
together
in
venice
we
found
we
were
making
practically
the
same
tour
and
we
joined
forces
i
saw
no
harm
in
it
i
see
no
harm
in
it
now
you
can
make
what
use
of
the
admissions
you
like
george
winter
and
do
you
think
you
will
be
able
to
persuade
a
british
jury
that
you
and
robert
colby
travelled
through
italy
together
merely
to
look
at
churches
and
pictures
catherine
george
i
know
now
that
i
never
cared
for
you
but
i
promise
you
on
my
word
of
honour
that
i
ve
never
been
unfaithful
to
you
george
winter
my
dear
it
s
not
a
question
of
convincing
me
i
am
the
most
trusting
the
most
credulous
of
mortals
but
of
convincing
the
twelve
good
men
and
true
who
form
a
british
jury
catherine
you
re
not
a
fool
george
you
know
people
and
you
know
what
i
m
capable
of
and
what
i
m
not
in
your
heart
you
re
certain
that
i
ve
done
nothing
that
can
give
you
any
cause
for
complaint
i
ve
suffered
a
great
deal
during
these
four
years
i
wouldn
t
wish
my
worst
enemy
to
go
through
what
i
have
i
implore
you
not
to
drag
me
through
this
horror
george
winter
my
dear
your
positively
takes
me
aback
catherine
how
can
you
be
so
ignoble
george
winter
his
bantering
tone
quickly
and
you
must
know
me
very
little
kate
my
whole
life
is
at
stake
and
you
think
i
m
going
to
be
moved
by
entreaties
or
abuse
i
m
at
the
most
critical
point
of
my
career
part
of
my
strength
is
that
i
never
deceive
myself
i
m
only
an
adventurer
my
millions
are
paper
millions
and
i
want
to
be
in
such
a
position
that
if
i
m
in
need
of
half
a
million
i
can
go
to
the
big
men
and
get
it
and
if
one
of
them
asks
me
for
half
a
million
i
can
afford
to
put
it
down
and
now
if
only
i
hold
on
i
shall
get
everything
i
want
and
you
come
and
whine
before
me
and
play
the
fool
what
d
you
think
i
care
for
your
do
what
you
like
i
don
t
care
so
long
as
you
re
not
flagrant
catherine
oh
george
winter
that
anyone
can
be
such
a
fool
as
to
let
love
interfere
with
his
life
it
s
so
unimportant
catherine
to
me
it
means
the
whole
world
george
winter
well
i
give
you
your
choice
if
you
bring
an
action
against
me
i
bring
a
catherine
into
my
choice
is
made
long
ago
i
m
strong
in
my
innocence
george
winter
you
ll
ruin
me
and
ruin
your
father
but
you
ll
ruin
robert
colby
as
well
catherine
what
do
you
mean
george
winter
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
re
so
as
to
imagine
he
can
do
anything
but
resign
his
seat
if
he
were
made
in
a
divorce
case
they
say
if
we
get
in
again
he
s
to
be
given
the
ministry
of
war
it
s
the
end
of
his
political
career
catherine
we
have
nothing
to
reproach
ourselves
with
nothing
george
winter

sent
a
note
to
him

night

old
dear
george
george

thought
so

want
you
to
give
o
donnell
a
job
catherine
anne
o
donnell
i
say
nan
you
needn
t
put
it
so
bluntly
anne
it
s
no
good
beating
about
the
bush
with
george

it
george
winter
and
not
much
anne
now
sit
down
and
let
me
talk
sensibly
to
you
catherine
anne
i
d
rather
you
didn
t
just
now
george
and
i
are
busy
george
winter
have
they
interrupted
you
darling
i
thought
you
had
nothing
more
you
wanted
to
say
anne
is
anything
the
matter
george
winter
nothing
kate
s
a
little
under
the
weather
this
morning
anne
oh
my
dear
i
m
so
sorry
what
is
it
george
winter
i
warned
you
not
to
eat
that
de
foie
last
night
my
dear
it
always
disagrees
with
you
catherine
please
don
t
worry
about
me
george
winter
anne
why
d
you
want
me
to
give
o
donnell
a
job
anne
because
he
s
my
young
man
george
winter
is
he
by
jove
o
donnell
i
offered
her
my
hand
and
heart
anne
and
being
a
practical
person
i
promptly
inquired
what
were
his
worldly
possessions
o
donnell
they
re
not
only
nil
they
re
astonishingly
nil
in
point
of
fact
if
you
reckon
debts
they
re
positively
minus
anne
so
i
fell
into
his
arms
and
said
let
us
put
up
the
banns
at
once
george
winter
jolly
and
that
s
where
i
come
in
anne
well
i
thought
he
might
manage
one
of
your
railways
or
be
your
chauffeur
or
if
you
didn
t
think
he
was
good
enough
for
that
you
might
make
him
director
of
one
of
your
companies
catherine
nan
you
don
t
know
what
you
re
talking
about
anne
good
heavens
if
papa
can
direct
companies
surely
teddie
can
catherine
no
i
didn
t
mean
that
but
there
are
circumstances
that
you
don
t
understand
o
donnell
can
t
ask
george
to
do
anything
for
him
o
donnell
george
winter
really
kate
you
might
let
me
answer
for
myself
anne
george
always
said
he
d
help
me
when
i
wanted
to
marry
george
winter
o
donnell
i
presume
your
idea
is
to
go
into
the
city
o
donnell
yes
more
or
less
george
winter
educated
at
a
public
school
i
suppose
o
donnell
yes
i
was
at
harrow
george
winter
a
twinkle
in
his
then
i
may
take
it
that
you
tried
to
get
into
the
army
and
failed
o
donnell
yes
i
suppose
i
did
george
winter
and
you
hadn
t
got
enough
money
to
go
into
the
diplomatic
anne
how
on
earth
d
you
know
george
george
winter
when
a
young
man
of
family
and
education
tells
me
he
wants
to
go
into
the
city
i
know
it
s
because
he
s
too
incompetent
to
do
anything
else
fifty
years
ago
the
fool
of
good
family
went
into
the
church
now
he
goes
into
the
city
o
donnell
you
re
not
very
flattering
george
winter
i
dare
say
you
ll
suit
me
all
right
anne
oh
george
you
are
a
brick
george
winter
give
me
a
kiss
and
i
ll
find
him
a
job
anne
i
ll
give
you
two
kisses
him
on
both
george
winter
i
shan
t
find
him
two
jobs
anne
i
can
t
imagine
why
everybody
s
so
afraid
of
you
george
you
re
an
old
dear
george
winter
a
heart
of
gold
that
s
what
i
always
tell
kate
o
donnell
come
and
see
me
morning
and
we
ll
have
a
talk
about
things
o
donnell
it
s
awfully
good
of
you
george
winter
you
know
you
ll
have
to
do
as
you
re
told
if
you
come
to
me
o
donnell
i
dare
say
i
shan
t
mind
that
george
winter
it
s
not
always
pleasant
being
at
the
beck
and
call
of
a
damned
bounder
o
donnell
how
d
you
mean
george
winter
of
course
you
look
upon
me
as
a
damned
bounder
i
know
that
i
wasn
t
educated
at
harrow
my
father
was
a
hatter
at
middlepool
a
nonconformist
and
an
aitchless
one
at
that
i
went
to
sea
when
i
was
fourteen
and
when
i
was
your
age
i
was
earning
bob
a
week
as
clerk
in
a
bucket
shop
of
course
i
m
a
damned
bounder
anne
now
george
don
t
be
disagreeable
george
winter
well
run
along
children
have
you
spoken
to
your
father
about
this
anne
no
we
re
going
to
leave
you
to
do
that
george
winter
are
you
anne
well
you
see
father
s
sure
to
kick
up
a
bit
of
a
row
because
teddie
s
so
absolutely
stony
but
if
you
say
you
ve
given
him
a
job
catherine
father
may
object
anne
oh
he
wouldn
t
dare
if
george
said
it
was
all
right
catherine
a
slight
gesture
partly
of
vexation
and
partly
of
george
winter
are
you
really
very
keen
on
marrying
anne
awfully
george
winter
well
i
ll
see
what
i
can
do
nods
o
donnell
o
donnell
anne
out
as
soon
as
they
have
catherine
catherine
george
you
re
not
going
to
take
teddie
o
donnell
in
your
service
you
must
understand
it
s
impossible
george
winter
why
catherine
we
can
accept
nothing
from
you
george
winter
this
disinterestedness
is
rather
a
new
trait
in
your
family
isn
t
it
catherine
you
re
only
wasting
his
time
in
making
him
come
down
to
see
you
george
winter
i
don
t
suppose
it
s
as
valuable
as
all
that
catherine
anne
will
have
to
be
told
the
facts
and
she
ll
see
at
once
that
it
s
out
of
the
question
for
teddie
to
accept
favours
from
you
george
winter
i
wonder
catherine
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
george
winter
do
you
think
she
ll
be
pleased
when
she
s
told
that
owing
to
your
unreasonableness
her
marriage
can
t
take
place
are
you
sure
she
won
t
say
that
she
has
no
quarrel
with
me
catherine
i
should
make
her
understand
george
winter
it
seems
rather
selfish
on
your
part
doesn
t
it
if
anne
s
heart
is
set
upon
marrying
this
rather
foolish
boy
have
the
heart
to
prevent
her
catherine
i
ve
sacrificed
myself
long
enough
it
s
anne
s
turn
now
george
winter
you
ll
find
one
of
the
forms
of
in
which
people
are
never
wildly
anxious
to
take
turn
and
turn
about
catherine
what
can
you
do
with
teddie
o
donnell
he
s
no
good
to
you
george
winter
i
m
not
sure
i
like
dealing
with
gentlemen
when
they
go
into
the
city
they
take
to
dirty
work
with
an
alacrity
which
you
often
don
t
find
in
the
city
man
born
and
bred
catherine
even
if
there
was
nothing
else
i
would
do
all
i
could
to
prevent
a
decent
boy
from
being
exposed
to
your
influence
george
winter
well
you
may
try
yours
on
anne
tell
her
that
i
ll
start
her
young
man
on
four
hundred
a
year
and
i
ll
allow
her
a
couple
of
hundred
more
so
that
they
can
marry
next
week
if
they
want
to
and
add
that
you
are
divorcing
me
and
it
would
be
monstrous
if
either
of
them
accepted
my
offer
catherine
oh
i
know
well
enough
that
you
didn
t
make
him
pretty
speeches
because
you
took
any
interest
in
doing
a
kindness
it
was
merely
another
coil
of
the
chain
you
ve
twisted
round
me
oh
it
s
fiendish
each
way
i
turn
i
find
that
you
bar
my
way
george
winter
in
the
agitation
of
the
moment
you
seem
to
be
mixing
your
metaphors
my
dear
thompson
butler
comes
thompson
robert
colby
has
come
madam
george
winter
is
he
waiting
downstairs
thompson
i
ve
shown
him
in
the
he
said
he
would
wait
till
you
were
disengaged
ma
am
george
winter
ask
him
to
come
up
catherine
i
ll
leave
you
thompson
very
good
sir
george
winter
with
my
best
wishes
i
ll
go
and
discuss
the
weather
and
the
crops
with
your
excellent
father
and
you
shall
discuss
the
situation
with
robert
colby
catherine
for
goodness
sake
leave
me
alone
george
winter
suggest
a
and
see
how
he
takes
it
my
own
impression
is
that
he
ll
run
like
a
rabbit
george
winter
towards
the
door
that
leads
into
the
library
and
george
winter
and
if
he
does
you
know
whose
arms
are
open
to
receive
you
whose
mercedes
is
panting
to
take
you
to
whose
sheltering
roof
a
guffaw
he
goes
catherine
a
sigh
of
exhaustion
and
then
braces
herself
for
the
coming
robert
colby
is
a
handsome
man
of
forty
spare
and
active
with
a
refined
face
and
good
features
he
is
clean
shaven
his
hair
is
grey
he
has
charming
manners
and
an
air
of
slightly
courtesy
his
voice
is
soft
and
thompson
robert
colby
catherine
to
him
with
both
hands
her
manner
becomes
brighter
and
more
joyous
she
seems
to
throw
off
the
load
of
wretchedness
which
had
oppressed
her
butler
catherine
how
good
of
you
to
come
colby
her
you
look
as
if
you
were
surprised
to
see
me
catherine
you
must
be
frantically
busy
i
thought
you
might
not
be
able
to
manage
it
colby
you
know
very
well
wild
labour
leaders
couldn
t
have
prevented
me
catherine
of
course
i
know
you
wouldn
t
really
let
me
interfere
with
anything
serious
but
it
s
very
pleasant
to
flatter
myself
that
the
whole
country
is
waiting
while
you
re
wasting
your
time
with
me
d
you
know
what
i
ve
done
colby
i
suspected
what
your
note
meant
but
i
m
anxious
to
hear
it
from
your
own
lips
catherine
i
ve
crossed
the
rubicon
i
m
seeing
my
solicitor
and
the
petition
will
be
filed
as
soon
as
ever
it
s
possible
colby
i
m
so
glad
you
had
no
right
to
go
on
with
that
degrading
life
catherine
i
want
you
to
assure
me
again
that
i
m
right
i
m
so
weak
i
feel
so
utterly
defenceless
colby
it
won
t
be
very
long
now
before
catherine
no
not
yet
robert
colby
i
want
to
tell
you
at
once
how
passionately
i
love
you
catherine
the
tenderest
of
d
you
think
it
s
needful
i
m
so
glad
to
think
you
ve
never
made
love
to
me
there
was
all
the
love
i
wanted
in
the
look
of
your
eyes
and
your
voice
though
you
said
quite
commonplace
things
told
me
that
you
cared
for
me
colby
i
ve
never
even
kissed
your
hand
kate
catherine
i
m
very
grateful
to
you
now
more
than
ever
i
want
to
feel
quite
sure
that
we
have
nothing
to
reproach
ourselves
with
colby
it
s
rather
hard
on
me
catherine
do
you
think
i
find
it
any
easier
sometimes
when
i
ve
been
dreadfully
lonely
dreadfully
wretched
i
ve
longed
to
be
able
to
rest
my
head
on
your
shoulder
and
i
ve
thought
i
might
have
loved
my
tears
if
you
could
have
kissed
them
away
colby
were
you
angry
with
me
when
i
wrote
to
you
the
one
foolish
letter
catherine
how
could
i
be
colby
i
was
dreadfully
unhappy
then
everything
i
tried
seemed
to
go
wrong
i
was
utterly
dispirited
and
i
couldn
t
help
writing
catherine
i
read
the
letter
till
i
knew
every
word
by
heart
sometimes
i
wonder
how
i
could
have
borne
my
life
at
all
except
for
the
knowledge
that
you
cared
for
me
colby
you
ve
never
once
told
me
that
you
love
me
kate
catherine
d
you
want
me
to
say
it
in
so
many
words
why
else
d
you
think
i
m
exposing
myself
to
all
the
humiliation
all
the
horrors
that
are
before
me
yes
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
colby
and
after
it
s
all
over
catherine
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
colby
you
ve
meant
so
much
to
me
kate
all
the
success
i
ve
had
i
feel
that
i
owe
to
you
sometimes
i
ve
hated
the
intrigues
and
the
littleness
of
politics
i
ve
been
tempted
to
give
the
whole
thing
up
but
you
put
fresh
courage
into
me
it
s
because
of
you
that
i
ve
been
able
to
ignore
the
rest
and
just
keep
my
eyes
fixed
always
on
the
greatness
of
the
aim
catherine
it
makes
me
so
proud
to
hear
you
say
that
colby
did
you
read
the
speech
i
made
yesterday
catherine
no
i
m
afraid
i
haven
t
yet
colby
wretched
woman
and
every
jack
one
of
the
papers
has
given
a
leader
on
it
catherine
i
m
so
sorry
it
s
horrid
of
me
colby
what
nonsense
of
course
you
ve
had
much
more
important
things
to
think
about
catherine
tell
me
all
about
it
i
suppose
it
was
the
army
debate
colby
yes
i
burnt
my
ships
behind
me
i
said
i
thought
some
form
of
compulsory
service
was
essential
perigal
s
going
to
the
country
at
once
i
think
we
shall
get
in
and
if
we
do
i
wish
to
goodness
they
d
give
me
the
war
office
of
course
after
six
years
in
office
we
can
only
hope
for
a
small
majority
and
every
seat
will
count
i
wonder
what
will
happen
at
middlepool
catherine
george
is
very
popular
colby
yes
that
s
just
it
as
long
as
he
was
there
the
seat
was
safe
i
wonder
if
anyone
else
will
be
able
to
hold
it
catherine
do
you
think
it
will
be
impossible
for
him
to
stand
again
colby
quite
and
rightly
no
man
s
obliged
to
go
into
parliament
if
he
does
it
s
his
duty
to
keep
clear
of
scandal
catherine
a
very
slight
start
and
when
she
speaks
her
voice
is
not
quite
catherine
that
might
be
very
difficult
a
man
might
be
an
object
of
scandal
and
yet
be
perfectly
innocent
supposing
a
malicious
person
brought
an
action
for
divorce
against
him
it
might
be
merely
an
attempt
at
blackmail
it
would
be
monstrous
to
punish
him
for
something
that
wasn
t
his
fault
colby
d
you
honestly
think
that
s
a
possible
case
if
a
man
is
shot
at
it
s
true
he
may
not
be
technically
guilty
but
he
can
hardly
be
blameless
if
a
case
can
be
made
out
at
all
against
him
he
must
have
done
something
very
foolish
catherine
not
answer
she
is
terrified
at
what
he
colby
george
winter
only
went
into
the
house
for
his
private
ambition
he
contested
a
seat
in
order
to
give
himself
a
stronger
financial
position
and
now
he
wants
to
use
his
money
to
force
himself
into
some
sort
of
job
we
ve
got
no
use
for
people
like
that
catherine
if
she
were
changing
the
i
wonder
what
you
d
do
if
you
were
beaten
at
the
general
election
colby
a
i
don
t
think
my
constituents
will
throw
me
out
as
long
as
i
behave
myself
catherine
and
if
they
did
colby
a
little
it
would
just
about
break
me
up
politics
are
my
whole
life
i
can
t
imagine
existence
without
the
house
of
commons
and
i
have
so
much
to
do
if
they
ll
only
give
me
a
chance
i
want
to
stopping
but
good
heavens
i
m
just
going
to
make
a
speech
catherine
oh
my
dear
i
m
so
proud
of
you
i
admire
you
so
enormously
colby
not
yet
hang
it
all
wait
to
admire
me
till
i
m
minister
of
war
catherine
an
affectionate
you
dear
now
you
must
go
i
ve
got
ever
so
much
to
do
and
i
m
sure
you
ought
to
have
colby
then
god
bless
you
say
something
nice
to
me
before
i
leave
you
catherine
i
shall
think
of
you
all
day
long
colby
thank
you
goes
catherine
exhausted
into
a
chair
but
she
george
winter
and
pulls
herself
together
he
comes
in
etchingham
george
winter
the
great
man
has
taken
his
hook
catherine
his
remark
with
a
look
but
does
not
george
winter
i
heard
his
fairy
footsteps
on
the
stairs
etchingham
well
catherine
i
hope
you
ve
thought
better
of
things
george
winter
well
looks
at
her
with
malicious
amusement
and
she
her
head
thrown
back
stares
at
him
with
hatred
and
catherine
you
think
every
man
is
a
rogue
don
t
you
george
winter
certainly
not
i
think
nine
men
out
of
ten
are
rogues
or
fools
that
s
why
i
make
money
catherine
and
what
ll
you
do
when
you
come
across
the
tenth
man
who
s
neither
rogue
nor
fool
george
winter
put
him
under
a
glass
case
catherine
you
may
find
him
awkward
to
deal
with
take
care
george
winter
i
shall
but
i
ve
looked
for
him
so
long
that
i
can
t
help
thinking
he
doesn
t
move
in
my
set
now
and
then
i
ve
thought
i
d
really
got
him
but
while
i
was
scratching
my
head
and
wondering
how
the
deuce
i
was
going
to
manage
i
ve
seen
an
itching
palm
steal
softly
out
and
i
knew
it
wasn
t
the
tenth
man
after
all
butler
thompson
george
winter
bennett
would
like
to
speak
to
you
sir
george
winter
is
he
on
the
telephone
thompson

what
the
deuce
can
he
want
george
winter
i
ll
come
down
to
him
etchingham
no
let
him
come
up
perhaps
it
s
something
important
and
he
ll
want
to
see
me
too
george
winter
perhaps
tell
him
to
come
up
thompson

good

catherine
who
is
bennett
etchingham

s
the
secretary
of
two
or
three
of
our
companies

sort
of
thing

all
the
work

a
look
of
fear
and
bewilderment
on
his
face
for
a
moment
he
hesitates
uncertain
what
to
do
then
quickly
makes
up
his
mind
and
clenches
his
bennett
up
to
governor
george
winter
if
that

hundred
thousand

i

a
father
and
such
a
mother

a
monster
of
determination

come
to
see
your
father
catherine
they
mustn
t
let

george
hasn
t
made
any

got
no
right
to
force
yourself
upon
me
makes
a
movement
to

room
but
he
intercepts

he
takes
a
paper
out
of
his
george

i

just
been
served
with
this
catherine
what

t
help
what

my
business
i
can
allow
no
one
to
interfere
with
me
lady
francis
what
is
that
george
george
winter
would
you
like
to
look
at
it
it
s
an
interesting
document
catherine
it
s
the
petition
mother
lady
francis
i
wish
i
had
my
glasses
i
ve
never
seen
one
before
george
winter
you
ve
been
lucky
lady
francis
an
acid
or
virtuous
george
winter
you
ve
got
to
withdraw
this
catherine
surely
you
must
see
that
from
now
all
communications
between
us
must
pass
through
our
lawyers
george
winter
rats
catherine
the
room
and
rings
the
bell
at
the
side
of
the
george
winter
what
are
you
ringing
for
catherine
for
thompson
to
open
the
door
for
you
george
winter
that
s
excessively
thoughtful
of
you
catherine
mother
can
t
you
protect
me
from
this
lady
francis
my
dear
your
husband
is
six
feet
high
and
broad
in
proportion
i
ll
tell
thompson
to
kick
him
downstairs
if
you
like
george
winter
but
it
s
not
a
job
that
any
butler
would
enjoy
butler
in
and
waits
for
an
george
winter
oh
thompson
i
m
expecting
three
gentlemen
here
at
five
o
clock
you
ll
show
them
into
the
library
and
let
me
know
the
moment
they
come
thompson
very
good
sir
goes
catherine
what
do
you
mean
by
this
george
winter
that
s
precisely
what
i
came
to
tell
you
i
suppose
you
ve
been
talking
there
ve
been
references
to
a
dispute
between
us
in
the
middlepool
papers
and
the
the
conservative
rag
has
stated
in
the
current
issue
that
you
are
divorcing
me
catherine
the
middlepool
papers
are
singularly
george
winter
that
s
where
you
re
mistaken
the
is
printing
a
special
edition
with
a
complete
and
authoritative
denial
of
the
whole
story
i
ve
issued
a
writ
for
libel
against
the
catherine
one
lie
more
or
less
on
your
conscience
can
make
no
great
difference
to
you
george
winter
i
ve
explained
your
presence
here
by
your
susceptibility
to
fresh
paint
lady
francis
what
do
you
mean
george
winter
a
the
day
after
kate
left
portman
square
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
house
needed
i
m
having
it
papered
and
painted
from
cellar
to
attic
when
it
s
finished
i
shall
start
again
lady
francis
fortunately
the
british
workman
takes
his
time
george
winter
but
that
s
not
enough
the
middlepool
people
are
nervous
about
the
whole
thing
you
know
swalecliffe
he
s
the
nonconformist
minister
one
of
those
confounded
busybodies
who
go
poking
their
noses
into
everybody
s
private
life
he
s
on
my
committee
he
and
ford
control
the
dissenting
interest
between
them
they
ve
got
it
into
their
heads
that
they
want
the
truth
from
you
catherine
me
lady
francis
who
is
ford
george
winter
oh
he
s
the
richest
man
in
middlepool
he
s
one
of
my
directors
on
the
middlepool
investment
trust
hard
as
nails
shrewd
as
they
make
em
but
a
nonconformist
to
the
tips
of
his
fingers
he
s
just
built
a
congregational
church
out
of
his
own
pocket
he
s
a
corker
to
deal
with
lady
francis
but
i
don
t
understand
what
do
these
men
want
kate
to
do
george
winter
they
re
coming
here
at
five
o
clock
with
boyce
my
agent
to
ask
kate
if
there
s
any
truth
in
the
rumours
lady
francis
but
it
s
outrageous
george
winter
of
course
it
s
outrageous
but
what
d
you
expect
from
a
parcel
of
sneaking
middlepool
dissenters
lady
francis
and
what
do
you
expect
kate
to
say
george
winter
she
s
going
to
say
it
s
the
first
she
s
heard
of
it
then
they
re
going
to
ask
her
if
she
s
divorcing
me
and
she
s
going
to
repudiate
the
suggestion
with
all
the
scorn
at
her
command
catherine
i
refuse
to
see
these
people
george
winter
do
you
catherine
or
do
you
want
me
to
tell
them
before
your
face
that
every
word
they
ve
heard
is
true
yes
i
ll
see
them
i
ll
settle
the
whole
thing
and
then
i
shall
be
rid
of
this
persecution
but
i
shall
tell
them
the
exact
truth
george
winter
it
s
not
five
o
clock
yet
butler
in
followed
perigal
is
the
prime
minister
he
is
a
stoutish
man
of
middle
height
with
abundant
grey
hair
worn
long
his
face
is
sensual
shrewd
and
bland
his
manner
is
kindly
and
thompson
perigal
lady
francis
my
dear
bob
this
is
kind
of
you
perigal
how
d
you
do
well
kate
catherine
you
never
come
and
see
us
now
you
re
prime
minister
perigal
it
s
a
delusion
of
the
public
that
the
prime
minister
has
nothing
to
do
but
pay
afternoon
calls
turns
george
winter
i
m
very
glad
to
see
you
here
george
winter
on
the
best
possible
terms
with
my
lady
francis
well
when
are
you
going
to
dissolve
parliament
perigal
himself
comfortable
in
an
i
ve
been
so
busy
i
haven
t
had
time
to
read
the
papers
for
some
days
what
do
they
say
about
it
lady
francis
don
t
be
irritating
bob
perigal
my
dear
a
wise
prime
minister
looks
upon
it
as
a
privilege
to
fulfil
the
intelligent
anticipations
of
the
press
lady
francis
i
hope
it
s
not
true
that
you
re
going
to
give
emily
lascelles
the
home
office
perigal
good
heavens
you
talk
as
if
your
sex
were
already
comfortably
installed
in
the
house
lady
francis
you
know
perfectly
what
i
mean
it
doesn
t
matter
about
the
men
because
all
the
work
is
done
by
the
permanent
officials
but
their
wives
are
quite
another
matter
i
tell
you
frankly
it
will
be
a
great
mistake
if
emily
lascelles
goes
to
the
home
office
perigal
why
lady
francis
she
can
t
entertain
she
doesn
t
know
a
word
of
french
she
dresses
abominably
perigal
that
settles
it
emily
lascelles
shall
not
go
to
the
home
office
george
winter
a
that
is
how
history
is
made
lady
francis
oh
george
frank
bought
a
print
of
napoleon
the
other
day
that
he
wants
to
show
you
do
come
up
will
you
george
winter
of
course
lady
francis
george
collects
things
about
napoleon
you
know
perigal
ah
the
napoleon
of
finance
i
m
sorry
to
hear
that
frank
is
laid
up
lady
francis
oh
he
s
much
better
we
shall
only
be
five
minutes
goes
out
george
winter
perigal
how
naturally
your
mother
did
that
it
almost
took
me
in
catherine
have
you
come
to
see
me
by
arrangement
perigal
i
m
up
to
my
eyes
in
work
i
m
afraid
i
could
hardly
find
time
for
a
chat
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
without
a
rather
special
object
catherine
i
suppose
not
perigal
but
your
husband
s
presence
leads
me
to
suppose
that
your
common
sense
has
made
my
errand
unnecessary
catherine
haven
t
you
heard
of
the
life
we
led
together
perigal
i
make
a
point
of
never
believing
the
disagreeable
things
that
are
said
about
a
man
who
subscribes
so
handsomely
to
the
party
funds
as
your
husband
catherine
then
i
have
you
against
me
too
perigal
my
dear
child
i
ve
known
you
all
your
life
your
mother
is
my
first
cousin
we
all
desire
nothing
more
than
your
happiness
catherine
george
was
served
with
the
petition
this
morning
perigal
ah
it
appears
that
two
prominent
supporters
of
your
husband
are
coming
up
from
middlepool
this
afternoon
to
get
from
your
own
lips
a
denial
of
the
rumours
that
have
been
circulating
in
the
constituency
catherine
i
can
promise
you
that
they
re
not
going
to
get
it
perigal
i
wish
i
could
persuade
you
to
pause
before
you
take
such
an
irrevocable
step
catherine
but
why
should
you
care
perigal
we
ve
been
in
for
six
years
we
re
dissolving
parliament
at
once
i
don
t
know
if
we
shall
get
in
again
it
ll
be
a
very
close
shave
we
can
t
afford
to
risk
a
couple
of
seats
catherine
a
couple
perigal
the
chief
whip
tells
me
that
your
husband
proposes
to
lodge
a
counter
petition
catherine
if
it
weren
t
so
odious
the
idea
would
be
laughable
i
promise
you
that
perigal
yes
yes
of
course
neither
you
nor
robert
colby
has
anything
to
reproach
himself
with
that
is
obvious
but
well
i
gather
that
the
evidence
is
such
that
a
case
could
be
made
out
it
would
be
awkward
just
at
this
moment
for
all
of
us
i
myself
could
wish
that
my
relationship
to
your
dear
mother
weren
t
quite
so
close
the
british
people
for
some
reason
always
judge
moral
delinquencies
on
the
radical
side
with
great
severity
i
have
always
thought
it
a
hardship
that
the
tories
should
have
a
sort
of
prescriptive
right
to
the
more
amusing
forms
of
immorality
catherine
let
us
understand
one
another
plainly
do
you
mean
that
if
my
husband
drags
robert
colby
through
the
divorce
court
you
ll
throw
robert
overboard
even
if
his
innocence
is
proved
through
and
through
perigal
my
dear
no
one
is
so
innocent
that
there
s
not
occasion
for
many
people
to
shake
their
heads
and
say
one
never
knows
i
don
t
suppose
any
prime
minister
would
invite
a
man
to
enter
his
cabinet
who
d
been
in
a
divorce
suit
catherine
it
s
nothing
short
of
blackmail
george
makes
no
concealment
of
the
fact
perigal
he
has
a
brutal
frankness
which
is
sometimes
rather
engaging
catherine
oh
you
drive
me
mad
my
whole
happiness
is
at
stake
and
you
can
pause
to
smile
at
that
odious
cynicism
you
ve
known
robert
and
me
all
our
lives
won
t
you
believe
in
us
won
t
you
stand
by
us
perigal
my
dear
in
the
position
entrusted
to
me
i
can
t
take
risks
i
dare
say
you
know
that
one
of
the
items
in
our
programme
is
a
modified
form
of
compulsory
service
i
don
t
know
that
i
altogether
like
it
myself
but
it
ll
take
the
wind
out
of
the
tory
sails
and
we
ve
got
to
do
something
robert
has
enthusiasm
and
he
believes
in
the
measure
he
s
just
the
man
to
pilot
it
through
the
house
catherine
he
s
set
his
heart
on
getting
the
war
office
perigal
well
you
have
it
in
your
hands
to
give
it
him
catherine
i
does
he
know
that
george
winter
has
made
certain
threats
perigal
i
think
not
catherine
oh
what
a
responsibility
you
put
upon
me
perigal
that
generally
goes
with
power
and
at
the
moment
you
have
that
too
catherine
a
moment
s
robert
and
i
have
never
hidden
anything
from
one
another
he
wouldn
t
wish
me
to
decide
on
a
matter
that
concerns
us
both
so
nearly
without
consulting
him
do
you
object
to
my
putting
the
whole
thing
before
him
perigal
not
a
bit
but
i
can
tell
you
at
once
what
his
answer
will
be
he
ll
say
that
he
loves
you
and
if
he
must
choose
between
you
and
everything
that
has
seemed
to
make
his
life
worth
living
he
chooses
you
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
catherine
a
little
sigh
of
relief
and
perigal
but
while
he
s
in
the
very
act
of
renouncing
the
world
for
your
sake
look
into
his
eyes
and
perhaps
you
ll
see
in
them
oh
only
for
a
moment
and
you
ll
have
to
look
sharply
the
shadow
the
merest
shadow
of
regret
and
perhaps
in
ten
years
when
i
bring
an
life
to
a
close
you
ll
say
to
yourself
if
i
hadn
t
sacrificed
him
he
might
be
standing
now
in
the
shoes
of
that
poor
old
incompetent
perigal
catherine
more
moved
than
she
wishes
to
i
don
t
believe
robert
is
ambitious
perigal
you
have
to
be
a
shrewd
observer
always
to
know
the
difference
between
ambition
and
patriotism
catherine
i
could
think
the
world
well
lost
for
love
perigal
yes
but
you
re
a
woman
d
you
think
a
man
can
catherine
not
answer
her
face
expresses
the
agony
of
her
spirit
perigal
s
sink
perigal
may
i
ring
and
ask
if
my
carriage
has
come
back
catherine
let
me
rings
the
perigal
i
asked
colby
to
fetch
me
in
it
so
that
we
might
run
down
to
the
house
together
butler
to
robert
colby
goes
thompson
colby
colby
i
thought
i
d
come
up
for
one
moment
just
to
say
how
d
you
do
catherine
some
gaiety
of
i
should
have
been
furious
if
you
hadn
t
perigal
of
course
i
ll
just
go
up
and
see
your
father
catherine
he
will
be
so
pleased
i
ll
take
you
up
perigal
no
no
no

i
couldn
t
hear
of
it
i
can
easily
find
my
way
colby
i
ll
do
my
best
to
entertain
you
while
perigal
is
gone
perigal
them
colby
up
to
her
i
jumped
for
joy
when
he
sent
me
a
note
asking
me
to
call
for
him
here
catherine
you
might
have
come
of
your
own
accord
colby
i
m
always
afraid
that
i
shall
bore
you
if
i
come
too
often
i
rack
my
brains
for
plausible
excuses
to
present
myself
at
your
front
door
what
s
the
matter
kate
catherine
with
me
nothing
colby
i
thought
you
seemed
worried
catherine
d
you
know
that
you
haven
t
shown
the
least
desire
to
kiss
me
colby
i
my
dear
i
was
obeying
your
strict
commands
catherine
if
you
really
wanted
to
you
wouldn
t
have
cared
two
straws
for
my
commands
colby
towards
my
darling
catherine
oh
no
don
t
i
don
t
beg
for
breaks
if
you
didn
t
think
of
it
of
your
own
accord
it
s
too
late
colby
what
on
earth
s
the
matter
with
you
catherine
if
you
love
me
why
don
t
you
say
so
sometimes
colby
good
heavens
it
s
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
every
moment
of
the
day
i
have
to
hold
myself
in
to
prevent
falling
at
your
feet
and
telling
you
how
much
i
care
catherine
oh
forgive
me
if
you
knew
how
dreadfully
sometimes
i
long
for
a
word
of
love
colby
her
in
his
darling
catherine
oh
it
s
too
hard
to
restrain
myself
always
have
i
been
peevish
and
horrible
colby
of
course
not
catherine
but
i
want
to
know
you
love
me
colby
kate
turns
her
face
to
him
and
kisses
her
on
the
catherine
her
face
and
beginning
to
cry
on
his
you
re
all
i
have
in
the
world
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
do
if
i
lost
you
colby
in
a
very
little
while
now
we
shall
belong
to
one
another
for
good
and
all
catherine
up
withdrawing
herself
a
little
and
looking
into
his
i
wonder
how
much
you
love
me
colby
with
all
my
heart
with
all
my
soul
catherine
d
you
love
me
enough
to
breaks
off
and
turns
away
from
colby
what
catherine
nothing
i
m
being
silly
and
sentimental
let
s
be
wise
and
as
well
behaved
as
we
generally
are
colby
i
can
t
understand
you
this
afternoon
kate
you
re
so
different
catherine
i
shall
frighten
you
you
ve
never
realized
that
i
m
a
creature
of
moods
are
you
sure
it
s
wise
to
link
your
life
to
a
woman
who
s
capable
of
making
almost
a
scene
without
any
provocation
colby
if
you
had
a
bad
temper
i
think
i
should
love
it
catherine
oh
colby
out
his
kate
catherine
cheerfully
as
if
she
were
i
want
to
put
a
purely
hypothetical
case
to
you
supposing
you
had
to
choose
between
me
and
your
career
which
would
you
choose
colby
you
of
course
catherine
how
glibly
you
say
it
colby
fortunately
i
shall
never
be
forced
to
make
such
a
tremendous
choice
catherine
of
course
not
colby
then
why
the
dickens
do
you
suggest
it
catherine
because
i
m
nervous
and
restless
and
rather
bored
i
wanted
to
hear
you
say
that
you
wouldn
t
hesitate
to
sacrifice
the
world
for
my
sake
colby
you
absurd
delightful
creature
is
all
smiles
and
coquetry
suddenly
the
tears
force
themselves
into
her
eyes
and
her
voice
catherine
bob
stretches
out
her
hands
and
he
takes
her
in
his
arms
and
kisses
her
passionately
she
breaks
away
from
him
and
stands
perigal
in
followed
francis
etchingham
wears
on
one
foot
a
large
felt
slipper
and
walks
with
a
perigal
your
father
insisted
on
coming
downstairs
etchingham
i
really
can
t
stand
my
room
any
longer
and
i
can
walk
quite
well
now
catherine
i
thought
o
farrell
said
you
were
to
stay
upstairs
till
father
etchingham
o
farrell
s
an
idiot
colby
it
certainly
looks
as
if
you
were
better
when
you
start
abusing
your
doctor
perigal
colby
i
hope
i
haven
t
kept
you
waiting
colby
not
a
bit
perigal
lady
francis
has
been
showing
me
an
old
photograph
etchingham
himself
heavily
into
an
that
little
joke
of
angela
s
didn
t
quite
come
off
catherine
him
a
footstool
and
puts
his
foot
on
perigal
i
looked
at
it
blankly
and
then
she
said
don
t
you
remember
it
s
it
gave
me
quite
a
start
it
was
the
photograph
of
a
young
lady
i
d
been
so
madly
in
love
with
that
i
asked
her
to
bolt
with
me
married
woman
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
would
you
believe
it
thirty
years
have
passed
since
then
and
upon
my
soul
i
didn
t
know
her
from
adam
etchingham
or
eve
catherine
at
him
gravely
seeing
the
application
to
herself
of
his
colby
you
must
congratulate
yourself
perigal
well
my
friends
i
do
i
m
not
a
quixotic
fellow
like
you
and
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
that
i
find
it
very
agreeable
to
be
secretary
for
foreign
affairs
and
prime
minister
and
yet
at
the
time
if
anyone
had
given
me
the
choice
between
my
present
position
and
a
trip
across
europe
with
the
object
of
my
affections
i
wouldn
t
have
hesitated
colby
a
merciful
providence
evidently
had
you
under
its
care
catherine
a
slight
start
and
rises
as
she
hears
these
words
and
looks
at
him
perigal
well
we
must
be
off
we
mustn
t
let
even
this
charming
lady
interfere
too
much
with
the
working
of
the
british
empire
catherine
perigal
you
must
get
your
mother
to
show
you
that
photograph
thirty
years
ago
i
thought
the
little
hussy
much
more
attractive
than
that
etchingham
frank
i
hope
your
foot
ll
be
all
right
in
a
day
or
two
perigal
colby
etchingham
i
remember
that
little
woman
quite
well
not
much
to
look
at
i
wondered
at
the
time
what
perigal
saw
in
her
catherine
you
don
t
want
me
just
now
father
do
you
etchingham
no
dear
are
you
going
out
catherine
i
m
only
going
to
my
room
i
want
i
want
to
be
alone
for
a
little
bit
etchingham
oh
she
can
give
any
explanation
butler
in
to
bennett
she
takes
advantage
of
this
to
make
her
thompson
bennett
etchingham
ah
bennett
forgive
me
if
i
don
t
get
up
bennett
i
m
glad
to
see
you
re
better
my
lord
etchingham

anything
the
matter
bennett
i
thought
your
lordship
expected
me
you
telephoned
etchingham
i
bennett
perhaps
the
governor
etchingham
ah
yes
of
course
george
didn
t
mention
it
i
suppose
he
wants
me
to
sign
cheques
i
can
do
it
just
as
well
here
as
at
the
office
i
expect
winter
is
in

you
mind
ringing
bennett

he
can

is
to
be
let
up
until
those
people
arrive
from
middlepool
etchingham
by
jove
i
d
forgotten
all
about
them
i
say
george

made
a
mistake
in
letting
them
come
george
winter
and
i
ve
told
lady
francis
that
we
shall
want
this
room
to
ourselves
and
no
one

to
come
in
without
knocking
at
the
door
etchingham
by
the
way
was
it
you
who
sent
for
bennett
george
winter
it
was
your
gout

very
handy

better
make
ourselves
cosy
quite
comfortable
etchingham
etchingham
quite
thank
you
george
winter
foot
all
right
etchingham
i
don
t
feel
it
at
the
moment
the
next
george
winter
as
gay
and
jovial
as
possible
he
is
thoroughly
amused
by
the
torture
he
is
inflicting
he
plays
francis
etchingham
a
cat
would
with
a
george
winter
i
thought
you
might
like
to
know
at
once
that
macdonald
s
report
on
the
mine
has
come
etchingham
ah
that
s
good
news
now
we
can
get
to
work
at
once
george
winter
have
you
got
it
with
you
fred
bennett
yes
sir
george
winter
i
m
sure
his
lordship
would
like
to
have
a
look
at
it
etchingham
yes
hand
it
over
bennett
this
is
really
a
thrilling
moment
i
believe
i
m
going
to
make
my
fortune
at
last
george
winter
as
you
justly
remark
it
s
a
thrilling
moment
bennett
the
report
out
of
a
and
hands
it
etchingham
etchingham
impressive
document
isn
t
it
smoothes
it
out
and
begins
to
george
winter
him
with
a
certain
george
winter
rather
technical
isn
t
it
etchingham
upon
my
soul
i
don
t
know
why
macdonald
can
t
put
it
into
plain
english
george
winter
i
m
thankful
he
didn
t
put
it
any
plainer
etchingham
i
must
honestly
confess
that
i
don
t
quite
grasp
what
he
means
george
winter
i
thought
you
wouldn
t
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
can
be
told
in
two
words
etchingham
down
the
report
with
a
slight
sigh
of
ah
george
winter
the
mine
was
practically
worked
out
when
we
bought
it
there
s
no
gold
there
worth
speaking
of
we
ve
been
done
in
the
eye
and
we
re
eighty
thousand
pounds
to
the
bad
is
a
moment
s
etchingham
george
winter
bennett
nervously
from
one
to
the
etchingham
able
to
speak
his
tongue
sticking
to
his
you
re
you
re
joking
george
winter
read
the
report
etchingham
at
it
then
george
winter
your
fortune
is
beginning
to
look
rather
silly
isn
t
it
so
s
mine
etchingham
is
this
true
bennett
bennett
i
m
afraid
it
is
my
lord
etchingham
my
god
what
s
to
be
done
now
george
winter
what
do
you
think
ought
to
be
done
etchingham
i
george
winter
you
re
chairman
of
the
syndicate
your
opinion
can
t
fail
to
be
valuable
etchingham
we
must
just
pocket
our
loss
george
winter
h
m
bennett
with
things
in
their
present
state
a
loss
like
that
is
about
as
much
as
we
can
stand
etchingham
the
slump
must
come
to
an
end
soon
george
winter
we
ve
been
saying
that
for
the
last
two
months
etchingham
then
what
the
deuce
is
to
be
done
george
winter
that
s
what
we
re
asking
you
bennett
we
ve
got
the
lewishams
to
reckon
with
george
winter
now
s
their
time
to
make
a
raid
on
us
etchingham
it
doesn
t
mean
that
we
smash
up
george
george
winter
out
his
boyce
will
be
here
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
etchingham
george
don
t
play
the
fool
now
i
ve
put
all
my
eggs
in
this
basket
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
rich
at
last
i
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
whole
thing
i
wanted
to
live
quietly
and
comfortably
bennett
what
are
you
going
to
do
governor
george
winter
etchingham
suppress
the
report
bennett
a
start
but
does
not
george
winter
go
ahead
as
if
we
believed
in
the
mine
we
ve
got
the
government
expert
s
report
on
which
we
bought
the
thing
we
ll
put
that
in
the
prospectus
etchingham
but
isn
t
that
dishonest
george
winter
very
etchingham
george
george
winter
it
s
an
axiom
in
mining
circles
that
when
you
ve
got
hold
of
a
rotten
thing
the
proper
course
is
to
pass
it
on
to
the
british
public
etchingham
the
public
will
find
out
there
s
no
gold
there
when
you
pay
no
dividends
george
winter
oh
we
ll
pay
dividends
for
a
year
or
two
by
then
we
shall
have
turned
the
corner
and
we
ll
find
another
carrot
for
the
british
public
etchingham
but
you
say
yourself
it
s
dishonest
george
winter
there
s
another
point
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
etchingham
what
is
that
george
winter
and
looks
at
him
for
an
instant
george
winter
we
paid
for
the
mine
with
money
that
didn
t
belong
to
us
etchingham
what
d
you
mean
george
winter
we
re
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
the
who
sneaks
five
bob
from
his
master
s
till
to
put
it
on
a
horse
if
the
horse
comes
in
he
puts
it
back
and
if
it
doesn
t
he
gets
a
month
s
hard
labour
we
shall
get
seven
years
etchingham
what
are
you
talking
about
george
george
winter
has
it
escaped
your
memory
that
you
and
i
are
directors
of
the
middlepool
investment
trust
etchingham
well
george
winter
we
had
to
plank
down
eighty
thousand
pounds
within
hours
or
lose
the
mine
bennett
it
looked
like
a
certainty
george
winter
at
that
moment
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
raise
anything
like
that
sum
the
bank
held
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
of
bearer
bonds
for
the
middlepool
investment
trust
they
delivered
them
on
an
order
signed
by
you
me
and
bennett
we
borrowed
on
them
and
completed
the
purchase
of
a
worthless
mine
etchingham
but
i
ve
never
signed
anything
bennett
yes
you
did
my
lord
they
wouldn
t
have
delivered
the
bonds
without
etchingham
then
my
signature
s
been
forged
george
winter
don
t
you
remember
one
day
after
an
excellent
luncheon
at
pym
s
you
were
just
off
to
a
wedding
and
i
asked
you
to
come
up
into
the
office
and
sign
some
papers
etchingham
but
i
never
looked
at
them
i
didn
t
know
george
winter
ah
that
s
your
affair
etchingham
i
shall
go
to
the
police
george
winter
d
you
think
you
ve
got
a
plausible
story
to
tell
them
it
sounds
devilish
improbable
that
a
business
man
a
chairman
of
half
a
dozen
companies
should
sign
documents
without
looking
at
them
bennett
and
i
will
swear
that
you
carefully
read
everything
that
was
put
before
you
as
indeed
was
your
duty
my
dear
friend
and
fully
understood
the
nature
of
your
act
etchingham
bennett
you
ll
testify
that
i
never
realized
for
a
moment
what
i
was
doing
you
told
me
they
were
purely
formal
documents
i
saw
george
sign
them
i
added
my
signature
without
hesitation
george
winter
i
think
bennett
would
be
more
than
human
if
he
cleared
you
at
his
own
expense
bennett
if
there
were
any
trouble
my
lord
i
should
have
to
tell
the
truth
etchingham
that
s
just
what
i
want
you
to
do
bennett
i
should
have
to
say
that
you
agreed
with
us
in
the
necessity
of
borrowing
the
bonds
with
the
idea
of
putting
them
back
as
soon
as
we
d
floated
the
company
and
that
you
signed
the
order
to
the
bank
with
full
knowledge
of
the
seriousness
of
your
act
george
winter
what
is
truth
said
jesting
pilate
bennett
you
re
just
as
deep
in
it
as
we
are
my
lord
etchingham
oh
my
god
george
winter
it
s
no
use
losing
one
s
head
because
one
s
in
a
tight
place
etchingham
you
ve
tricked
me
you
re
a
common
swindler
in
a
month
we
may
all
be
in
prison
george
winter
i
hear
they
make
you
very
comfortable
there
nowadays
etchingham
well
i
see
my
duty
before
me
i
didn
t
know
but
now
there
can
be
no
excuse
for
me
i
must
go
to
scotland
yard
at
once
i
shall
make
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
thing
george
winter
d
you
think
that
ll
help
you
it
may
mean
five
years
instead
of
seven
etchingham
every
one
will
know
that
i
m
incapable
of
such
an
act
george
winter
don
t
be
a
silly
fool
listen
to
me
we
ve
got
you
tight
if
we
go
under
you
go
under
too
let
there
be
no
doubt
in
your
mind
about
that
etchingham
i
must
do
my
duty
george
winter
your
duty
is
to
keep
your
head
and
help
us
out
of
the
mess
as
best
you
can
etchingham
but
nothing
can
be
done
the
mine
s
worthless
how
are
we
to
raise
eighty
thousand
pounds
george
winter
we
ve
got
six
weeks
before
we
need
replace
the
bonds
if
we
can
do
it
by
then
no
one
will
ever
know
they
ve
left
the
cellars
of
the
bank
etchingham
there
s
no
more
chance
of
replacing
them
in
six
weeks
than
there
is
the
day
after
george
winter
yes
there
is
if
we
can
float
the
company
that
s
where
you
come
in
i
ve
got
to
keep
my
seat
i
want
all
my
prestige
i
can
t
have
a
divorce
you
must
go
to
kate
at
once
and
tell
her
that
the
only
way
she
can
save
you
from
prison
is
by
telling
these
men
who
are
coming
from
middlepool
that
she
has
no
cause
for
complaint
against
me
etchingham
good
god
i
d
forgotten
kate
bennett
it
s
only
by
going
on
now
that
we
can
save
ourselves
and
the
money
that
s
invested
in
our
companies
etchingham
you
wouldn
t
have
got
into
such
a
mess
with
kate
if
you
hadn
t
made
such
a
damned
fool
of
yourself
why
couldn
t
you
leave
these
women
alone
george
winter
a
my
dear
fellow
you
speak
as
if
i
were
to
blame
they
simply
flung
themselves
into
my
arms
it
would
have
been
very
rude
if
i
hadn
t
occasionally
pressed
them
to
my
bosom
bennett
it
s
not
much
the
governor
asks
you
my
lord
etchingham
to
go
and
tell
my
daughter
that
i
m
a
thief
and
a
swindler
and
throw
myself
on
her
mercy
george
winter
that
s
it
etchingham
i
ll
see
you
damned
first
george
winter
the
alternative
is
prison
it
s
not
very
nice
penal
servitude
is
it
fred
you
know
all
about
it
you
can
tell
him
bennett
a
governor
etchingham
what
does
he
mean
george
winter
fred
s
a
solicitor
who
was
struck
off
the
rolls
he
was
sentenced
to
three
years
for
misappropriating
a
client
s
money
etchingham
good
god
is
that
true
bennett
bennett
yes
my
lord
etchingham
i
never
knew
george
winter
of
course
you
didn
t
it
s
not
the
kind
of
thing
you
d
expect
him
to
brag
about
is
it
but
it
ll
go
worse
with
him
if
we
re
found
out
because
he
s
been
at
it
before
tell
him
what
it
s
like
fred
bennett
oh
governor
don
t
george
winter
i
knew
him
before
he
went
in
his
name
was
feltman
then
and
when
they
let
him
out
i
took
him
because
i
felt
sure
he
had
everything
to
gain
by
sticking
to
me
and
everything
to
lose
by
giving
me
away
etchingham
my
god
george
winter
he
can
tell
you
what
you
re
in
for
what
the
broad
arrow
s
like
to
wear
and
what
the
food
s
like
to
eat
and
the
work
it
s
a
healthy
life
regular
hours
you
re
strong
for
your
age
i
don
t
see
why
you
shouldn
t
break
stones
in
the
quarries
with
the
rest
of
us
hour
after
hour
with
your
back
feeling
as
if
it
were
going
to
break
and
your
arms
aching
aching
but
not
so
badly
as
your
heart
bennett
down
and
sobs
difficultly
trying
to
restrain
george
winter
and
you
count
the
days
three
hundred
and
in
a
year
and
you
wonder
if
they
ll
ever
come
to
an
end
and
your
mind
keeps
on
working
it
wouldn
t
be
so
bad
if
you
were
a
brainless
hulk
like
the
man
who
s
sweating
away
beside
you
but
you
think
and
you
can
t
help
thinking
and
you
curse
yourself
and
you
think
of
the
people
outside
who
are
free
to
do
as
they
like
and
you
think
of
the
and
the
flowers
and
you
think
of
the
pleasant
streets
of
london
and
then
there
s
the
regret
which
wrings
your
heart
day
after
day
and
you
wish
you
wish
a
thousand
times
you
were
dead
you
sleep
you
re
too
tired
not
to
even
though
you
ve
got
hunger
gnawing
at
your
vitals
for
you
re
hungry
always
hungry
and
in
your
sleep
you
dream
that
you
re
back
again
in
your
home
happy
and
comfortable
and
when
you
wake
up
and
feel
your
hard
prison
bed
you
cry
like
a
child
bennett
oh
my
god
my
god
george
winter
and
then
when
you
come
out
it
s
not
over
you
slink
along
the
streets
feeling
that
it
s
written
on
your
forehead
for
every
one
to
see
and
your
heart
beats
when
you
catch
sight
of
a
policeman
and
at
night
it
all
comes
back
to
you
you
see
it
again
the
warders
the
convict
gang
the
prison
food
and
your
back
aches
with
the
labour
and
you
wake
shrieking
with
terror
shrieking
shrieking
is
a
etchingham
straight
in
front
of
him
with
chill
stony
bennett
brokenly
trembling
in
every
limb
there
is
a
knock
at
the
door
tap

george
winter
and
a
shiver
runs
through
him

knocking

pleased
to
meet
you
lord
francis
etchingham
it
s
very
kind
of
you
to
say
so
george
winter
when
i
suggested
to
lord
francis
that
it
would
be
more
convenient
for
you
to
come
here
he
put
his
house
at
my
disposal
my
wife
is
staying
here
you
know
we
re
doing
up
the
house
in
portman
square
and
she
can
t
stand
the
smell
of
paint
boyce
to
make
things
naturally
i
don
t
like
it
myself
george
winter

can
recommend
my
s
whisky
i
know
it
s
no
good
offering
you
one
swalecliffe
james
ford
boyce
and
i
had
a
little
drop
of
scotch
to
our
tea
george
winter
then
we
ll
get
to
business
at
once
shall
we
swalecliffe
his
i
should
like
to
say
before
we
go
any
further
that
it
is
with
the
greatest
regret
that
ford
and
i
have
come
up
to
london
on
such
an
errand
james
ford
there
s
been
a
lot
of
gossip
in
middlepool
and
well
we
thought
the
shortest
way
to
settle
it
was
boyce
i
personally
don
t
think
this
is
a
matter
of
which
the
committee
ought
to
take
any
notice
a
man
s
private
life
is
his
private
life
and
james
ford
that
s
all
very
well
colonel
winter
s
an
old
friend
of
mine
we
ve
had
business
dealings
together
for
the
past
twenty
years
but
well
it
s
a
question
of
winning
the
election
or
losing
it
there
s
never
been
much
in
it
one
way
or
another
and
fifty
votes
more
or
less
will
make
all
the
difference
swalecliffe
i
want
to
tell
you
frankly
winter
that
i
should
feel
it
my
duty
to
vote
against
you
if
there
were
any
truth
in
the
reports
that
have
been
going
about
and
i
should
feel
it
my
duty
to
advise
my
congregation
to
follow
my
example
george
winter
that
s
clear
enough
in
all
conscience
gentlemen
the
best
answer
i
can
make
to
you
is
that
i
receive
you
in
my
s
house
my
wife
is
upstairs
in
her
mother
s
boudoir
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
that
there
is
not
the
smallest
shadow
of
truth
in
any
single
syllable
that
you
have
heard
i
have
issued
a
writ
for
libel
against
the
and
boyce
surely
that
ought
to
satisfy
anyone
james
ford
well
it
doesn
t
satisfy
me
george
winter
perhaps
you
would
like
my
to
tell
you
that
every
word
i
say
is
scrupulously
true
swalecliffe
we
don
t
doubt
your
word
winter
but
we
came
to
london
with
a
particular
object
boyce
i
must
say
i
thought
from
the
beginning
it
was
open
to
the
gravest
question
james
ford
the
committee
discussed
it
at
length
and
the
majority
agreed
that
george
winter
of
course
of
course
etchingham
will
you
give
these
gentlemen
the
assurance
etchingham
a
moment
s
i
think
the
whole
thing
s
damned
impertinent
boyce
that
s
exactly
what
i
said
james
ford
you
re
only
wasting
time
winter
swalecliffe
we
made
up
our
minds
that
we
must
have
a
certain
assurance
from
the
lips
of
winter
then
we
can
go
back
to
middlepool
with
comfortable
minds
george
winter
d
you
mean
to
say
you
wish
to
my
wife
swalecliffe
i
merely
wish
her
to
answer
the
questions
that
were
put
to
you
in
colonel
boyce
s
letter
on
behalf
of
the
committee
george
winter
to
fly
into
a
violent
no
decent
woman
would
stand
it
i
refuse
to
ask
my
wife
to
expose
herself
to
such
a
degradation
james
ford
that
means
that
you
don
t
represent
middlepool
in
the
next
parliament
george
winter
george
winter
i
d
sooner
lose
my
seat
than
expose
a
defenceless
woman
to
such
humiliation
you
can
go
and
tell
that
to
your
committee
and
be
damned
to
you
swalecliffe
but
we
came
up
from
middlepool
on
the
understanding
that
we
were
to
see
your
wife
winter
george
winter
my
wife
is
in
very
delicate
health
james
ford
we
shan
t
keep
her
more
than
five
minutes
you
d
be
wise
to
let
common
sense
get
the
better
of
your
pretty
sentiments
is
a
slight
george
winter
that
he
can
not
bluff
them
out
of
their
determination
he
goes
over
silently
and
rings
the
george
winter
very
well
james
ford
i
think
it
s
the
best
thing
you
know
george
winter
but
if
my
wife
refuses
to
answer
i
warn
you
that
i
shall
not
say
a
word
to
persuade
her
i
think
the
whole
thing
s
a
perfect
scandal
butler
george
winter
tell
winter
that
lord
francis
and
i
would
be
very
much
obliged
if
she
d
come
to
the
for
one
moment
thompson
very
good
sir
boyce
i
wish
you
to
know
that
i
have
expressed
myself
very
strongly
all
through
against
this
proceeding
james
ford
shut
up
boyce
when
we
want
your
opinion
we
ll
ask
for
it

silence

some
time
catherine

not

very
well
lately
swalecliffe
george
winter
will
you
put
the
question
to
winter
that
we
set
in
our
letter
to
you
of
the
day
before
yesterday
george
winter
no
sir
if
you
re
not
ashamed
to
ask
the
question
you
may
ask
it
yourself
swalecliffe
i
am
a
stranger
to
winter
the
matter
requires
some
explanation
james
ford
it
s
no
use
making
any
bones
about
it
swalecliffe
winter
i
m
sorry
to
put
you
in
this
position
but
there
it
is
and
it
can
t
be
helped
there
are
busybodies
everywhere
and
middlepool
has
its
fair
share
of
them
there
s
been
a
lot
of
gossip
about
you
and
your
good
man
and
if
we
don
t
look
out
it
ll
lose
him
the
election
catherine
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
to
you
james
ford
well
we
want
to
be
able
to
go
back
to
middlepool
and
tell
them
we
ve
had
it
from
your
own
lips
that
there
s
no
truth
in
these
reports
is
a
etchingham
hardly
bear
his
bennett
trying
to
hide
his
george
winter
at
her
with
a
catherine
james
ford
one
another
and
she
looks
at
him
catherine
that
you
may
do
etchingham
prevent
a
little
gasp
of
relief
george

no
intention
of
divorcing
your
husband
catherine

ve
never

any
intention

bother
you

more

much

our
minds
at
rest
george
winter
shake
hands
george
winter
i
ll
shake
hands
with
you
but
i
can
t
help
saying
that
i
could
have
expected
more
charity
more
confidence
in
me
from
men
who
make
a
practice
of
belief
in
the
christian
church
james
ford
by
the
that
s
all
right
swalecliffe
i
can
understand
your
vexation
winter
but
we
were
in
a
very
difficult
position
james
ford

we
look
sharp

scene
is
a
spacious
in
the
palace
hotel
at
middlepool
it
is
sumptuously
furnished
with
the
lack
of
taste
peculiar
to
such
apartments
everything
is
large
and
rich
and
rather
stiff
it
is
obvious
that
the
decorations
have
been
carried
out
on
contract
by
a
firm
they
are
calculated
to
give
the
business
man
who
engages
the
room
the
impression
that
he
is
getting
his
money
s
the
left
is
a
large
french
window
opening
to
the
floor
and
looking
on
the
square
in
front
of
the
hotel
at
the
back
is
a
door
leading
george

on
the
right

doors

excited
buzz
of
boyce

sure
you
don
t
make
a
mistake
swalecliffe
i
can
t
imagine
what

become
of
him
one
would
have
thought
etchingham
colonel
boyce
if
he
s
not
there
you
d
better
try
somewhere
else
james
ford
for
goodness
sake
let
me
hear
myself
speak
speeches
are
said
simultaneously
and
immediately
afterwards
is
heard
the
dull
roar
of
a
train
passing
through
the
station
and
a
long
shrill
etchingham
etchingham
oh
confound
those
trains
james
ford
i
should
have
thought
you

got
used
to
them

not
slept
for
a
week
they
go
on
all

bennett
they
worried
me
a
bit
last
night
and
when
i
did
get
to
sleep
i
heard
them
whistling
away
through
my
dreams
boyce
they
don
t
seem
to
trouble
winter
etchingham
if
they
did
i
suppose
he
wouldn
t
come
to
this
hotel
james
ford
in
the
direction
george
winter
s
he
sleeps
next
door
doesn
t
he
boyce
he
told
me
he
slept
like
a
top
last
night
bennett
he
looked
as
fresh
as
paint
this
morning
etchingham
and
his
room
s
practically
on
the
line
james
ford
oh
nonsense
etchingham
yes
it
is
you
just
walk
down
a
flight
of
steps
into
the
garden
and
there
you
are
within
twenty
feet
of
the
line
james
ford
worst
place
in
middlepool
for
a
hotel
i
told
them
so
when
they
came
to
me
about
it
wanted
me
to
put
money
in
it
not
me
swalecliffe
in
james
ford
surely
winter
ought
to
be
here
by
now
james
ford
you
won
t
make
him
come
any
quicker
by
looking
out
of
the
window
boyce
every
moment
s
valuable
something
ought
to
be
done
at
once
etchingham
don
t
you
know
where
he
is
colonel
boyce
he
was
booked
to
speak
to
the
men
at
parker
and
gibbons
at
but
you
know
what
he
is
half
a
dozen
places
at
once
he
s
about
the
most
difficult
person
to
catch
i
know
swalecliffe
have
you
sent
down
to
parker
and
gibbons
boyce
yes
of
course
i
have
i
ve
sent
a
dozen
fellows
after
him
to
tell
him
to
come
to
the
hotel
at
once
bennett
you
ve
been
careful
you
ve
not
boyce
you
don
t
think
i
m
a
beginner
at
this
game

you
bennett
well
i
didn
t
know
how
you
d
made
him
understand

had
happened

not
made
him
understand
when
winter
s
told

the
palace

guess
something
s
in
the
wind
swalecliffe

re
sure
he
won
t
go
to
the
committee
rooms
boyce
if
he
does

ll
be
sent
on
i
thought
it
would
cause
a
lot
of
gossip
if
we
had
a
meeting
there
that
s
why
i
suggested
the
hotel
etchingham
i
wish
to
goodness

look
so
depressed
swalecliffe
swalecliffe
you
re
a
business
man

you
think
there
s
any
truth
in
this
article
james
ford

d
better
ask
lord
francis
he
s
chairman
of
the
new
company
i
m
only
an
investor
bennett
of
course

s
nothing
in
it

whole
thing
s
a
malicious
libel

about
it
etchingham
my
lord
i
wish
he
d
come
bennett
james
ford
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
think
there
s
anything
in
it
james
ford
i
ve
applied
for
ten
thousand
shares
you
don
t
suppose
i
like
it
when
an
article
comes
out
in
a
financial
paper
on
the
day
of
issue
that
the
mine
s
practically
worked
out
and
winter
s
expert
has
reported
that
the
ore
s
not
worth
the
cost
of
crushing
boyce
everybody
who
s
got
a
penny
to
spare
in
middlepool
has
applied
for
shares
james
ford
george
winter
told
me
it
was
the
biggest
thing
he
d
ever
had
bennett
he
s
never
let
you
down
before
why
should
he
let
you
down
now
james
ford
i
don
t
say
he
s
let
me
down
but
he
told
me
to
put
my
shirt
on
it
and
i
don
t
want
ten
thousand
worthless
shares
boyce
the
damnable
thing
is
that
it
should
happen
on
the
day
of
the
election
etchingham
it
would
be
monstrous
if
people
didn
t
vote
for
him
because
of
an
article
in
a
london
newspaper
boyce
you
know
what
people
are
they
lose
their
heads
the
seat
has
always
been
won
and
lost
on
the
wobblers
james
ford
oh
the
first
thing
is
to
win
the
seat
swalecliffe
well
we
shan
t
do
that
unless
winter
comes
at
once
and
we
make
up
our
minds
what
to
do
etchingham
ring
up
the
committee
rooms
boyce
and
ask
if
anything
s
been
heard
of
him
boyce
all
right
i
ll
do
that
swalecliffe
i
was
never
so
taken
aback
as
when
boyce
showed
me
the
telephone
message
from
london
etchingham
when
do
the
london
papers
get
here
ford
james
ford
they
ought
to
be
here
by
ten
boyce
into
the
put
me
on
will
you
etchingham
why
the
devil
don
t
they
bring
them
in
bennett
don
t
worry
i
ve
told
a
waiter
to
bring
them
as
soon
as
they
arrive
boyce
the
i
say
is
that
you
masters
has
winter
been
there
well
send
rogers
here
no
here
confound
you
the
palace
down
the
no
nothing
s
been
seen
of
him
since
early
this
morning
etchingham
i
wonder
what
the
other
side
are
going
to
do
when
they
hear
this
james
ford
oh
don
t
you
be
afraid
they
heard
about
the
attack
as
soon
as
ever
we
did
bennett
you
ought
to
have
held
the
line
and
prevented
them
from
getting
on
to
london
boyce
good
god
one
can
t
think
of
everything
at
once
etchingham
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
thing
has
been
about
as
disgracefully
mismanaged
as
it
could
be
boyce
if
you
d
ever
tried
to
run
an
election
you
d
know
it
wasn
t
so
easy
as
all
that
etchingham
i
m
not
an
election
agent
it
s
not
my
business
james
ford
come
come
gentlemen
it
s
no
good
quarrelling
about
it
three
speeches
are
spoken
at
swalecliffe
how
is
the
polling
going
on
boyce
oh
i
think
we
shall
have
the
heaviest
poll
we
ve
ever
had
james
ford
of
course
there
ll
be
some
slackening
off
just
now
a
lot
of
working
men
voted
when
the
polling
stations
opened
boyce
there
ll
be
twice
as
many
at
the
swalecliffe
you
don
t
know
what
the
tories
are
doing
colonel
boyce
i
should
think
i
did
know
they
re
going
to
set
up
the
article
as
soon
as
it
comes
in
etchingham
the
whole
article
boyce
the
whole
confounded
thing
james
ford
and
placard
the
streets
with
it
they
ve
made
arrangements
to
print
off
a
thousand
and
they
ve
got
their
bill
stickers
all
ready
and
waiting
etchingham
it
s
infamous
james
ford
nonsense
it
s
business
we
d
have
done
the
same
if
we
d
had
the
luck
to
get
such
a
stick
as
this
to
beat
morrison
with
the
very
morning
of
the
election
swalecliffe
the
comfort
is
they
don
t
know
morrison
and
they
do
know
winter
james
ford
that
s
the
danger
too
they
may
know
him
too
well
etchingham
i
don
t
know
what
the
devil
you
mean
by
that
you
seem
to
forget
that
you
re
speaking
of
my
james
ford
oh
we
re
not
here
to
pay
one
another
compliments
bennett
if
you
ll
wait
a
minute
or
two
he
ll
be
here
himself
and
you
can
say
to
him
anything
you
want
to
boyce
what
i
can
t
make
out
is
why
he
chose
this
particular
day
to
bring
out
his
company
bennett
he
didn
t
think
the
election
would
take
place
just
yet
james
ford
every
one
s
been
talking
of
a
general
election
for
the
last
two
months
bennett
you
know
it
was
sprung
upon
us
at
the
end
swalecliffe
couldn
t
he
have
kept
the
issue
back
etchingham
he
d
got
everything
fixed
up
by
then
james
ford
of
course
he
could
it
was
only
his
obstinacy
i
told
him
it
was
a
bad
time
to
give
an
american
issue
to
the
public
etchingham
well
you
weren
t
obliged
to
apply
for
shares
were
you
james
ford
tell
me
something
i
don
t
know
next
will
you
etchingham
i
can
tell
you
there
s
no
harm
in
keeping
a
civil
tongue
in
your
head
james
ford
thank
you
i
don
t
want
lessons
in
manners
from
you
bennett
you
won
t
do
yourselves
much
good
by
losing
your
tempers
swalecliffe
why
doesn
t
winter
come
boyce
i
dare
say
he
s
sent
his
car
to
take
some
one
to
the
poll
and
he
s
had
to
walk
etchingham
it
seems
to
me
that
you
ve
bungled
everything
you
could
boyce
i
don
t
know
why
the
devil
you
should
blame
me
waiter
comes
in
with
newspapers
on
a
bennett
here
they
are
at
last
crowd
round
the
waiter
and
take
the
papers
from
him
the
waiter
goes

thank
god
now
we
shall
know
the
worst
boyce
financial
james

of
stocks
and
shares
i
knew
it
was
wrong
oh
what
a
punishment
james
ford
we
can
t
all
read
the
paper
at
once
bennett
spread
it
out
on
the
table
that
s
the
best
way
bennett
ford
run
their
eyes
down
the
bennett
steep
isn
t
it
james
ford
if
the
tories
print
this
it
ll
about
bust
us
etchingham
the
whole
thing
s
a
pack
of
lies
it
s
scandalous
that
such
methods
should
be
used
to
influence
an
election
james
ford
swalecliffe
d
you
want
to
read
it
swalecliffe
what
does
it
say
bennett
merely
what
they
phoned
down
from
london
james
ford
but
it
puts
it
about
as
hot
as
i
ve
ever
seen
a
financial
article
etchingham
d
you
think
it
ll
interfere
with
the
issue
james
ford
it
ll
bust
it
etchingham
can
t
something
be
done
to
find
winter
boyce
all
we
can
do
is
to
wait
etchingham
hang
it
all
we
can
t
go
on
waiting
and
waiting
and
waiting
isn
t
there
one
of
you
who
can
do
something
james
ford
keep
your
head
man
that
s
about
the
best
thing
you
can
do
edward
o
donnell
o
donnell
it
s
all
right
i
ve
got
him
etchingham
thank
god
o
donnell
i
told
him
to
hurry
up
he
was
just
going
to
speak
to
some
fellows
in
a
factory
swalecliffe
he
s
coming
o
donnell
yes
rather
he
said
he
d
be
here
in
a
jiffy
james
ford
did
he
want
to
know
what
it
was
about
o
donnell
there
was
no
time
for
him
to
ask
and
he
was
talking
to
a
whole
crowd
when
i
found
him
swalecliffe
he
knows
it
s
important
bennett
don
t
be
afraid
about
that
if
he
says
he
ll
come
at
once
he
ll
come
boyce
here
he
is
etchingham
the
same
at
last
george
winter
in
and
surveys
them
for
a
moment
he
smiles
george
winter
quite
a
party
etchingham
we
thought
you
were
never
coming
george
winter
what
s
the
trouble
james
ford
to
the
that
s
the
trouble
bennett
financial
has
got
an
attack
on
the
campo
del
oro
george
winter
is
that
all
james
ford
it
s
a
good
deal
george
winter
the
lewishams
have
got
financial
in
their
pockets
james
ford
you
read
it
swalecliffe
they
say
there
s
no
gold
in
the
mine
george
winter
what
do
they
know
about
it
they
ve
not
been
there
and
my
expert
has
james
ford
that
s
just
it
they
say
you
re
floating
it
on
the
report
the
owners
gave
you
when
you
bought
it
and
you
re
holding
back
macdonald
s
george
winter
over
the
it
s
extraordinary
what
a
lot
the
papers
know
telephone
what
is
it
listens
for
a
london
call
you
d
better
go
and
speak
to
them
fred
the
no
don
t
connect
with
me
bennett
will
come
along
bennett
it
s
one
of
my
brokers
now
let
s
go
on
as
abuse
i
don
t
really
think
very
much
of
it
i
could
have
said
much
unpleasanter
things
about
myself
swalecliffe
you
seem
to
take
it
very
calmly
george
winter
i
ve
not
been
fighting
the
lewishams
for
ten
years
without
getting
some
pretty
hard
words
broken
on
my
back
james
ford
d
you
see
that
bit
about
where
the
money
came
from
etchingham
i
didn
t
see
that
george
winter
i
ll
read
it
you
shall
i
it
is
stated
that
winter
paid
eighty
thousand
pounds
for
this
precious
mine
it
would
perhaps
be
interesting
to
inquire
how
he
was
able
to
raise
such
a
sum
at
a
time
not
only
of
general
stringency
but
of
peculiar
difficulty
in
the
central
american
market
perhaps
winter
like
king
midas
is
able
to
turn
into
gold
everything
he
touches
and
he
may
have
been
able
to
change
his
office
furniture
into
precious
metal
perhaps
childish
isn
t
it
do
they
think
i
m
going
to
let
out
my
little
trade
secrets
to
please
them
james
ford
but
where
did
you
get
the
money
etchingham
a
slight
start
george
winter
perfectly
george
winter
my
dear
fellow
you
don
t
suppose
i
stole
it
do
you
that
s
where
the
born
financier
comes
in
he
makes
money
as
a
conjurer
makes
a
white
rabbit
appear
out
of
a
silk
handkerchief
james
ford
a
very
satisfactory
explanation
an
instant
hardly
perceptible
to
the
others
the
eyes
george
winter
james
ford
george
winter
but
that
s
hardly
the
point
is
it
the
rest
of
the
james
ford
thinking
the
matter
over
his
eyes
rest
george
winter
if
he
were
trying
to
guess
boyce
something
must
be
done
at
once
george
winter
have
the
tories
got
hold
of
it
boyce
they
re
printing
the
article
on
posters
george
winter
nuisance
isn
t
it
pauses
to
reflect
for
a
swalecliffe
in
upon
his
swalecliffe
is
there
any
truth
at
all
in
that
article
winter
george
winter
not
a
word
swalecliffe
it
puts
me
in
a
very
awkward
position
george
winter
what
s
the
matter
with
you
swalecliffe
i
thought
the
shares
would
go
to
a
premium
before
they
were
issued
george
winter
like
the
san
josé
tramways
eh
swalecliffe
ford
says
this
will
bust
the
issue
george
winter
nice
of
him
been
having
a
little
gamble
have
you
swalecliffe
if
it
was
a
certainty
i
didn
t
see
there
could
be
any
harm
in
it
george
winter
a
like
playing
with
loaded
dice
how
many
shares
have
you
applied
for
swalecliffe
five
hundred
george
winter
sporting
of
you
swalecliffe
i
didn
t
mean
to
take
them
up
you
understand
i
haven
t
got
more
than
five
hundred
pounds
in
the
world
i
thought
they
were
bound
to
go
up
half
a
crown
and
george
winter
five
hundred
half
crowns
are
quite
worth
having
aren
t
they
swalecliffe
it
s
been
a
lesson
to
me
i
ll
never
do
anything
like
it
again
i
shan
t
have
the
chance
if
i
have
to
pay
for
the
shares
george
winter
get
my
cheque
book
teddie
o
donnell
yes
sir
swalecliffe
what
are
you
going
to
do
george
winter
i
don
t
want
anyone
to
come
into
this
concern
who
doesn
t
believe
in
it
make
out
a
cheque
for
five
hundred
pounds
to
swalecliffe
o
donnell
out
a
cheque
during
the
next
swalecliffe
that
s
very
generous
of
you
george
winter
generous
not
a
bit
of
it
you
don
t
think
i
mind
having
five
hundred
shares
more
do
you
swalecliffe
d
you
think
they
re
worth
it
george
winter
they
ll
be
worth
ten
pounds
a
piece
in
six
months
or
i
m
a
dutchman
o
donnell
him
the
and
a
george
winter
his
name
and
tears
out
a
james
ford
he
is
doing
that
looks
as
if
you
had
confidence
in
the
mine
george
winter
the
cheque
swalecliffe
here
you
are
james
ford
d
you
want
me
to
buy
your
shares
off
you
james
ford
a
quiet
not
just
yet
thank
you
swalecliffe
but
what
s
the
meaning
of
the
article
then
george
winter
why
it
s
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
the
lewishams
were
willing
to
give
their
eyes
for
the
mine
but
i
was
too
much
for
them
now
they
re
crabbing
it
that
s
all
says
this
with
great
assurance
as
if
it
thoroughly
explained
the
whole
swalecliffe
but
then
george
winter
pay
that
into
your
bank
and
hand
over
the
certificate
to
me
when
you
get
it
swalecliffe
d
you
think
they
ll
go
to
a
premium
george
winter
i
ve
no
doubt
of
it
i
dare
say
the
five
hundred
will
be
just
as
useful
to
me
as
to
you
but
i
shall
hold
on
i
want
a
bigger
profit
than
that
swalecliffe
but
if
they
re
good
enough
for
you
they
re
good
enough
for
me
george
winter
no
you
ve
taken
my
cheque
now
it
s
too
late
swalecliffe
there
s
your
cheque
you
can
have
it
back
again
i
m
going
to
keep
the
shares
george
winter
well
i
don
t
mind
it
won
t
make
much
difference
to
me
but
don
t
sell
them
whatever
you
read
in
the
papers
what
s
a
profit
of
half
a
crown
wait
till
you
ve
got
a
profit
of
five
pounds
and
then
you
can
think
of
selling
them
swalecliffe
a
five
pounds
that
would
be
two
thousand
five
hundred
george
winter
colonel
boyce
wait
a
minute

bishop
and
jones

why

bennett
things

rotten
etchingham
good
lord
bennett
the
lewishams
are
going
for
us
george
winter
i
thought
they
would
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
article
bennett
who
s
given
it
away
d
you
think
george
winter
how
do
i
know
that
doesn
t
matter
the
only
thing
is
to
face
it
etchingham
d
you
mean
our
shares
are
falling
bennett
bennett
there
s
a
lot
of
selling
george
winter
i
wish
we
could
corner
them
i
d
like
to
give
the
bears
a
lesson
bennett
if
it
goes
on
there
ll
be
a
panic
george
winter
you
ve
told
the
brokers
to
do
all
they
can
to
prevent
its
going
too
far
bennett
i
ve
told
them
to
buy
but
carefully
george
winter
you
must
go
up
to
london
fred
there
s
no
one
there
with
a
head
on
his
shoulders
bennett
i
thought
that
was
the
best
thing
myself
i
ve
looked
out
the
trains
i
can
just
catch
the
express
i
shall
be
there
soon
after
one
george
winter
then
bolt
at
once
i
give
you
a
free
hand
bennett
if
the
slump
can
be
stopped
i
ll
stop
it
george
winter
it
s
not
a
matter
of
can
it
must
be
stopped
and
wire
reassuring
messages
we
must
hang
on
to
the
telephone
for
all
we
re
worth
bennett
george
winter
and
come
back
when
the
house
closes
we
must
talk
over
things
bennett
all
right
good
luck
goes
etchingham
is
it
all
up
with
us
george
george
winter
what
the
dickens
are
you
talking
about
etchingham
they
ve
found
out
the
truth
it
s
there
in
black
and
white
that
the
wretched
mine
s
worthless
george
winter
they
can
t
prove
anything
etchingham
ever
since
i
knew
i
ve
scarcely
closed
my
eyes
at
night
i
wish
i
d
shot
myself
when
you
first
told
me
george
winter
my
dear
fellow
you
re
much
more
comfortable
here
than
you
would
be
at
kensal
green
etchingham
and
the
worst
of
it
is
breaks
at
first
i
was
overcome
with
the
horror
of
it
but
little
by
little
i
ve
got
used
to
it
used
to
your
being
a
thief
and
a
swindler
george
winter
a
you
put
things
rather
bluntly
don
t
you
etchingham
and
bennett
was
a
convict
it
all
seems
quite
natural
now
and
i
can
talk
and
laugh
with
you
and
i
eat
by
your
side
every
day
george
winter
one
can
t
make
a
fortune
without
taking
risks
etchingham
there
are
always
those
missing
bonds
they
re
in
my
thoughts
day
and
night
george
winter
no
one
can
make
inquiries
for
three
weeks
by
that
time
we
shall
have
gone
to
allotment
and
the
bonds
will
be
safely
back
in
the
black
box
etchingham
but
will
you
be
able
to
go
to
allotment
george
winter
of
course
we
shall
this
article
isn
t
going
to
do
us
any
harm
i
shall
win
the
seat
that
ll
give
these
middlepool
people
confidence
etchingham
george
i
believe
ford
is
uneasy
i
don
t
trust
him
supposing
he
found
out
about
the
bonds
george
winter
it
might
be
devilish
expensive
etchingham
you
ll
never
buy
him
george
winter
i
never
met
the
man
yet
who
hadn
t
his
price
flattery
if
he
s
a
fool
hard
cash
if
he
s
a
wise
man
but
a
price
of
some
sort
there
s
always
a
price
etchingham
take
care
of
ford
george
george
winter
a
i
m
not
frightened
etchingham
sometimes
i
m
afraid
you
re
so
confident
it
s
impossible
a
thing
like
this
can
end
well
george
winter
i
believe
in
my
star
i
ve
been
in
tight
corners
before
but
i
ve
wriggled
out
of
them
i
m
stronger
than
ever
i
was
i
ve
got
ten
times
more
brains
than
any
of
my
competitors
the
ball
is
at
my
feet
and
i
ve
only
got
to
set
it
rolling
what
d
you
think
difficulties
are
to
me
i
ve
never
been
in
better
spirits
so
alert
so
buoyant
as
during
these
last
weeks
when
my
neck
has
been
in
a
noose
and
every
policeman
i
passed
might
have
a
warrant
in
his
pocket
for
my
arrest
if
there
were
ten
times
more
difficulties
i
d
overcome
them
all
in
ten
years
i
shall
be
the
richest
man
in
london
in
fifteen
i
shall
be
a
peer
my
god
i
feel
as
if
the
world
were
an
orange
and
i
d
got
my
teeth
into
it
and
i
shall
suck
it
dry
etchingham
i
wonder
how
many
ruined
lives
will
be
sacrificed
to
give
you
all
you
want
you
walk
over
dead
bodies
and
broken
hearts
george
winter
rot
i
flutter
the
of
gain
before
the
covetous
and
they
follow
they
want
to
make
money
without
working
for
it
well
i
m
cleverer
than
they
are
swalecliffe
gambles
with
his
five
hundred
pounds
his
five
hundred
pounds
will
find
its
way
into
my
pocket
it
s
his
own
look
out
each
for
himself
and
the
devil
take
the
hindmost
a
by
george
i
ve
got
an
idea
the
lewishams
can
t
attack
my
stocks
without
weakening
their
own
we
re
in
the
same
boat
and
if
one
of
us
shakes
it
both
ll
topple
out
etchingham
what
d
you
mean
george
winter
well
we
ll
attack
the
lewishams
i
ll
get
on
to
maclaren
s
at
once
go
to
the
post
office
and
wire
to
bennett
he
s
sure
to
call
at
the
office
he
ll
twig
by
george
that
s
the
ticket
why
didn
t
i
think
of
it
before
we
ll
make
the
lewishams
sorry
they
started
this
game
etchingham
but
supposing
george
winter
good
god
man
don
t
suppose
do
as
i
tell
you
don
t
you
see
we
ve
got
nothing
to
lose
and
everything
to
gain
i
know
my
luck
s
in
and
i
follow
my
luck
that
s
genius
etchingham
a
sigh
and
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
goes
out
to
send
the
george
winter
to
walk
excitedly
up
and
curtain
scene
ii
scene
takes
place
in
the
of
the
palace
hotel
but

eleven
o
clock

pale
darling
catherine

been
sleeping

well

so
near
the
trains

they
seem
to
run
all
night
lady
francis
i
wonder
how
george
can
stand
it
his
room
is
practically
on
the
railway
catherine
thank
heaven
it
s
over
we
shall
know
the
result
in
half
an
hour
and
we
can
go
lady
francis
what
are
you
going
to
do
catherine
what
can
i
do
nothing
lady
francis
i
m
afraid
you
re
very
unhappy
kate
catherine
please
don
t
think
that
mother
lady
francis
you
ve
given
up
everything
for
our
sake
catherine
i
wish
i
could
think
so
i
gave
up
my
divorce
because
because
i
was
afraid
i
couldn
t
risk
the
regret
that
robert
might
feel
later
i
should
always
have
been
looking
for
it
one
must
never
forget
that
love
is
a
woman
s
whole
life
but
it
s
never
more
than
part
of
a
man
s
never
lady
francis
what
did
you
tell
him
catherine
i
wrote
and
said
i
found
it
impossible
to
go
on
with
my
action
i
begged
him
not
to
try
to
move
me
i
told
him
i
was
very
unhappy
lady
francis
poor
child
catherine
he
wrote
very
kindly
he
made
it
as
easy
for
me
as
he
could
and
now
it
s
all
over
i
ve
lost
my
last
chance
of
happiness
i
m
bound
to
my
husband
for
the
rest
of
my
life
lady
francis
and
do
you
still
love
robert
catherine
yes
and
i
m
glad
of
what
i
ve
done
the
only
thing
that
helps
me
is
the
pride
i
take
in
all
the
great
things
he
s
going
to
do
and
it
will
have
been
me
i
gave
him
the
opportunity
anne
in
she
is
wearing
a
coat
and
skirt
and
a
anne
well
you
are
strange
people
how
on
earth
can
you
sit
there
and
sew
while
the
counting
s
going
on
i
ve
never
been
so
excited
in
my
life
catherine
why
have
you
come
back
anne
well
it
s
nearly
finished
now
teddie
said
there
d
be
rather
a
scrummage
when
the
result
was
known
and
i
d
better
get
out
of
the
way
catherine
obedient
creature
anne
it
rather
amuses
me
to
be
ordered
about
besides
i
couldn
t
help
seeing
that
nobody
wanted
me
teddie
promised
he
d
bolt
round
as
soon
as
the
result
was
out
i
say
let
s
have
some
light
shall
we
turns
on
the
electricity
and
the
room
is
suddenly
a
glare
of
lady
francis
you
ll
blind
us
anne
i
love
an
election
i
ve
never
had
such
a
time
in
my
life
i
ve
enjoyed
every
minute
of
these
three
weeks
i
hope
teddie
ll
go
into
parliament
lady
francis
her
on
four
hundred
a
year
anne
oh
george
will
give
us
a
rise
he
says
teddie
s
awfully
useful
george
good
isn
t
he
catherine
i
m
glad
you
re
so
happy
darling
anne
after
a
little
quick
look
at
you
re
not
angry
with
us
kate
catherine
good
heavens
why
should
i
be
anne
you
know
it
s
so
dreadfully
hard
to
pretend
i
haven
t
got
eyes
in
my
head
why
don
t
you
make
it
up
with
george
katie
catherine
i
don
t
know
what
makes
you
think
there
s
anything
to
make
up
anne
oh
my
dear
what
i
didn
t
guess
for
myself
teddie
told
me
catherine
he
would
have
been
wiser
to
mind
his
own
business
anne
it
was
rather
catherine
if
you
knew
how
things
were
between
george
and
myself
and
you
were
willing
to
accept
his
favours
what
do
you
expect
me
to
say
i
didn
t
ask
you
not
to
i
knew
if
i
had
you
would
only
have
refused
i
m
cynical
enough
to
know
that
in
this
world
each
of
us
takes
care
of
his
own
interests
lady
francis
my
dear
don
t
be
so
bitter
anne
one
has
to
take
people
as
one
finds
them
george
has
always
been
charming
to
me
if
you
d
only
make
allowances
for
him
catherine
oh
my
dear
don
t
i
m
not
in
the
humour
to
stand
that
leave
me
to
lead
my
own
life
without
interference
surely
it
s
enough
that
to
bind
me
to
him
george
should
give
you
an
income
to
marry
on
you
can
t
want
more
from
me
than
that
anne
oh
my
dear
i
m
so
sorry
i
didn
t
mean
to
say
anything
that
would
hurt
you
catherine
you
haven
t
forgive
me
i
didn
t
mean
to
make
a
scene
but
my
nerves
are
a
little
upset
i
m
a
very
weak
selfish
woman
audit
s
dreadfully
hard
to
be
half
as
angelic
as
you
think
me
i
m
very
glad
that
you
re
going
to
marry
teddie
you
re
in
love
with
one
another
and
if
you
haven
t
much
money
what
does
it
matter
i
m
sure
you
ll
be
tremendously
happy
anne
you
are
a
dear
francis
etchingham
is
wearing
a
dinner
jacket
and
a
black
anne
up
anne
is
it
over
etchingham
no
i
was
too
anxious
to
stay
any
longer
lady
francis
but
george
is
going
to
get
in
etchingham
who
can
tell
the
seat
has
always
been
lost
or
held
by
a
handful
of
votes
anne
but
how
did
it
seem
to
be
going
etchingham
winter
morrison
winter
morrison
one
vote
on
one
side
one
vote
on
the
other
it
seemed
interminable
lady
francis
he
won
by
last
time
etchingham
who
can
tell
the
effect
of
all
these
rumours
and
suspicions
and
attacks
they
may
just
have
made
the
difference
oh
it
s
maddening
catherine
sit
down
father
and
rest
you
look
quite
done
up
etchingham
even
george
is
anxious
i
know
his
face
so
well
he
s
trying
to
appear
as
if
he
were
certain
anne
no
human
being
could
help
being
anxious
lady
francis
a
sudden
i
thought
i
heard
some
shouting
anne
oh
i
wish
i
hadn
t
come
away
lady
francis
let
s
open
the
window
perhaps
we
shall
hear
something
lady
francis
anne
to
the
window
and
open
lady
francis
no
i
was
mistaken
anne
listen
i
m
sure
i
hear
cheering
goes
out
on
to
the
balcony
she
lady
francis
half
hidden
from
view
so
that
it
may
be
supposed
the
following
scene
catherine
lord
francis
not
heard
by
etchingham
a
low
voice
catherine
oh
my
dear
will
you
ever
forgive
me
catherine
oh
father
don
t
it
was
very
noble
of
you
not
to
tell
me
anything
before
i
decided
now
that
i
know
the
whole
truth
etchingham
the
only
hope
we
ve
got
is
to
go
on
if
he
gets
in
if
we
can
pull
things
together
we
may
get
out
of
the
muddle
he
s
positive
of
it
the
only
thing
that
held
me
up
was
the
thought
of
all
of
you
if
i
d
gone
to
the
police
there
and
then
or
made
away
with
myself
it
would
have
meant
the
ruin
of
all
of
you
catherine
and
of
all
the
unhappy
people
who
ve
trusted
everything
they
had
to
george
etchingham
you
think
i
was
right
kate
don
t
you
it
wasn
t
just
cowardice
on
my
part
catherine
i
hope
you
were
right
etchingham
but
if
it
was
all
in
vain
if
he
s
not
able
to
float
the
company
and
the
truth
comes
out
then
i
shall
have
sacrificed
you
for
nothing
catherine
oh
don
t
think
of
it
etchingham
i
believe
if
he
wins
the
election
he
ll
be
strong
enough
to
force
the
issue
on
them
catherine
but
if
the
mine
s
worthless
etchingham
we
re
going
to
buy
the
shares
in
when
the
tide
turns
in
central
america
things
are
looking
brighter
already
he
s
promised
me
that
no
one
shall
lose
a
farthing
when
that
s
done
i
go
oh
how
thankful
i
shall
be
catherine
oh
i
know
i
know
etchingham
i
had
to
tell
some
one
and
i
couldn
t
tell
your
mother

it
easier
to
bear
now

back
into
the

the
same
time

vague
muffled
shouting

in
the

suspense

awful
lady

dishevelled
with

on
his
shoulder
to
show
her
lady
francis
what

the
majority
o

slight
bow

justified
in
trusting
my
luck

coming
out
right

lewishams

be
able
to
stand
against
me
much
longer

james

a
richer
man
than

and
when
i
m
in
with
the
lewishams
i
shall
bide
my
time
manny
lewisham

t
last
much
longer
and
his
sons

fools
when
he

gone
i
shall
get
the
whole
business
in
my
hands
i
ve
got
ten
times
more
brains
than
anyone
in
that
market
there
s
no
one
who
can
stand
against
me
james
ford
you
haven
t
forgotten
that
article
in
financial
george
winter
oh
is
that
what
you
want
to
talk
to
me
about
i
tell
you
that
shan
t
disturb
my
night
s
rest
by
the
way
that
reminds
me
if
i
have
won
the
election
it
was
through
no
help
of
yours
i
asked
you
to
go
down
and
speak
in
the
cattle
market
and
when
i
got
there
i
found
there
d
been
no
sign
of
you
it
might
have
been
devilish
awkward
james
ford
well
it
so
happens
it
didn
t
matter
george
winter
where
did
you
get
to
after
all
james
ford
at
i
went
up
to
london
george
winter
doing
all
he
can
to
hide
his
did
you
james
ford
quietly
almost
i
was
struck
by
one
of
the
paragraphs
in
the
article
the
one
about
where
you
got
the
money
from
george
winter
a
i
noticed
that
seemed
to
bother
you
a
bit
james
ford
things
were
pretty
tight
at
that
time
george
winter
a
man
in
my
position
can
always
lay
his
hands
on
money
james
ford
it
was
a
big
sum
george
winter
fair
to
moderate
is
a
very
short
pause
the
two
men
both
shrewd
hard
and
keen
face
one
another
like
two
james
ford
it
struck
me
that
the
middlepool
investment
trust
had
got
a
large
batch
of
bonds
lying
in
the
bank
george
winter
the
effect
of
this
george
winter
a
well
they
re
lying
there
still
james
ford
will
you
take
your
oath
on
that
george
winter
yes
james
ford
the
more
i
thought
of
it
the
more
nervous
i
was
i
went
to
the
bank
george
winter
him
a
rapid
look
but
otherwise
makes
no
sign
that
he
realizes
his
theft
is
james
ford
they
showed
me
an
order
for
delivery
of
the
bonds
signed
by
you
etchingham
and
bennett
george
winter
have
a
cigar
will
you
james
ford
no
what
have
you
done
with
those
bonds
george
winter
if
they
re
in
their
place
when
the
auditor
makes
his
examination
no
one
has
any
question
to
ask
james
ford
you
had
no
more
right
to
touch
them
than
my
office
boy
has
the
right
to
take
a
sovereign
from
the
petty
cash
george
winter
what
the
devil
d
you
mean
by
that
james
ford
i
m
a
director
of
the
middlepool
investment
trust
i
insist
on
the
bonds
being
produced
at
once
george
winter
they
shall
be
produced
in
a
fortnight
james
ford
no
no
my
friend
that
won
t
do
george
winter
don
t
be
a
fool
james
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
business
is
business
james
ford
yes
and
not
theft
george
winter
flying
into
a
how
dare
you
speak
to
me
like
that
james
ford
it
s
no
good
trying
to
bluster
with
me
george
i
ve
seen
you
do
it
at
shareholders
meetings
and
very
effective
it
is
sometimes
but
this
isn
t
the
time
for
it
is
a
george
winter
the
position
and
determines
to
face
george
winter
all
right
then
i
knew
the
mine
was
a
good
thing
i
pledged
the
bonds
to
pay
for
it
i
shall
get
them
back
as
soon
as
the
money
comes
in
from
the
issue
now
you
ve
got
it
james
ford
it
s
theft
pure
and
simple
george
winter
i
suppose
you
want
to
come
in
with
me
does
not
james
ford
s
movement
of
i
ll
give
you
your
shares
for
nothing
that
means
ten
thousand
pounds
and
if
you
hold
on
to
them
they
ll
be
worth
fifty
thousand
in
a
year
james
ford
thank
you
i
m
not
going
to
risk
a
lifetime
s
honest
work
for
a
few
thousand
pounds
george
winter
then
what
do
you
want
james
ford
nothing
george
winter
a
slight
you
ve
been
mayor
of
middlepool
twice
and
you
ve
done
a
lot
of
work
for
the
party
i
can
t
help
thinking
it
s
almost
time
the
government
showed
some
appreciation
of
your
services
james
ford
you
ve
mistaken
your
man
george
winter
i
ve
worked
like
a
nigger
for
thirty
years
i
ve
not
let
any
chance
slip
by
me
but
i
ve
never
done
anything
that
a
man
need
be
ashamed
of
i
ve
built
up
an
honest
business
to
leave
to
my
sons
and
an
honest
name
i
m
too
old
to
start
being
a
rogue
now
george
winter
i
thought
you
wanted
to
talk
business
james
ford
right
s
right
and
wrong
s
wrong
you
can
t
get
over
that
i
couldn
t
rest
for
a
moment
if
i
thought
any
act
of
mine
wasn
t
above
board
it
s
no
credit
of
mine
i
m
just
made
that
way
george
winter
if
he
were
talking
to
a
come
james
we
ve
been
good
friends
for
twenty
years
james
ford
a
low
this
afternoon
when
i
found
out
what
you
d
done
well
i
could
have
cried
is
a
real
anguish
in
his
tone
which
george
winter
the
first
time
he
realizes
that
the
affair
is
serious
he
begins
to
get
george
winter
but
you
don
t
mean
seriously
james
ford
how
can
i
make
you
understand
you
don
t
seem
to
see
that
now
i
know
what
you
ve
done
i
m
just
filled
with
horror
and
loathing
if
you
ve
done
this
god
knows
what
else
you
haven
t
done
i
don
t
want
to
be
hard
on
you
i
must
do
my
duty
i
m
a
director
of
the
company
i
put
all
my
friends
in
it
i
put
my
sister
into
it
and
this
mine
is
it
true
what
that
paper
says
for
all
i
know
that
s
a
swindle
too
george
winter
sudden
you
re
not
going
to
push
me
down
now
that
i
m
almost
at
the
top
of
the
tree
i
ve

five
minutes
ago

was
a
fortnight

don

these
things

t
come
right

a
man
has
crossed
the
line
that
separates
honesty
from
dishonesty
he
never
gets
back
george
winter
if
you
give
me
away
now
it
ll
mean
a
general
smash
the
only
chance
of
saving
things
is
to
go
on
the
money
s
gone
you
won
t
get
it
back
by
giving
me
up
to
the
police
james
ford
i
must
take
my
chance
of
that
after
all
if
i
don
t
speak
it
makes
me
a
party
to
the
crime
it
can
be
proved
that
i
went
to
the
bank
george
winter
now
you
re
saying
something
i
can
understand
if
i
show
you
by
plain
figures
that
i
can
put
everything
right
if
you

only
give
me
time

again
if

a
matter
between
my
conscience
and
myself

put
me
in
this
position
george

done
something
that
other
men
have
done
before
me
and
it
s
come
out
all
right
at
the
time
i
thought
the
slump
would
only
last
a
few
days
and
i
thought
i
should
be
able
to
replace
the
bonds
in
a
week

the
only
slip
i
ve
made
don

me
six
months
to

bonds
are
in
their
place
by
four
o
clock

impossible
james
ford
that

for
you
george

knowing
what
he
is
but
no
one
could
get

hold
out
till
the
tide
turns
that

not

a
chance

s
absurd
james
ford
that

my
last
word
george
winter
you
might
as
well
send
for
the
police
at
once
oh
my
god

impossible
james
ford
if
the
money
is
not
there
by
the
time
the
bank
closes
i
shall
apply
for
a
warrant
george

james

do
more
for
you
than
i

offered
finality
of
this

deep
regret
and
the
decision
ford

are
like
a
blow
in
the
face
george
winter
gives
a
sudden
start
and
throwing
off
his
humbleness
flies
into
ungovernable
passion
he
whips
himself
into
a
rage
as
he
flings
the
scornful
invective
james
ford
ends
up
on
the
last
words
in
a
positive
scream
of
george
winter
oh
it
s
infamous
it
s
damned
hypocrisy
you
don
t
care
if
i
ve
taken
the
money
or
not
you
re
afraid
of
your
own
skin
and
you
re
jealous
of
me
it

envy
i
knew
you
envied
me
all
the
time
d
you
think
i
ve
been
taken
in
by
you
you
were
a
little
tin
god
in
middlepool
till
i
came
along
you
didn
t
fight
me
like
a
man
you
just
sided
with
me
waiting
for
your
chance
to
trip
me
up
you
think
when
i
m
gone
you
ll
have
the
field
to
yourself
why
shouldn
t
you
be
the
member
as
well
as
i
it

you
with
your
damned
christianity

you
james

gone
too
far
i
shall
never

you
can
t
realize
that
a
man
may
be
honest
even
if
he
loses
by
it
just
because
he
can
t
help
it
because
he
s
made
straight
as
some
men
are
made
crooked
george
winter
it
s
childish
james
ford
you
ve
got
through
the
world
by
knowing
that
nine
men
out
of
ten
are
rascals
you
ve
forgotten
that
the
tenth
man
must
cross
your
path
at
last
he
hears
these
george
winter
a
start
and
he
looks
ford
staring
terrified
eyes
he
passes
his
hand
over
his
forehead
trying
to
george
winter
to
who
said
that
to
me
before
is
a
james
ford
george
my
promise
holds
george
winter
it
s
no
good
to
me
i
m
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
you
can
get
what
fun
you
like
out
of
seeing
me
wriggle
a
james
ford
at
him
then
silently
goes
george
winter
seized
with
a
horrible
convulsive
trembling
he
shakes
as
a
man
might
shake
in
an
ague
with
his
quick
mind
he
sees
that
no
subtlety
will
save
him
now
he
is
up
against
the
blank
wall
of
a
character
as
strong
as
his
own
in
a
catherine

george

what
the
devil
d
you
want
catherine

a
dazed
way
to
his

talking
about
catherine
i
understand
that
i
ve
condoned
all
your
offences
towards

at
her
he
takes
in
at
last
what
she
is

reason
that

should
expose
myself
any
longer
to
a
humiliation
that
i
found
unbearable

come
to
tell
you
that

moment

anything
further
to

as
he
remains
silent
she
goes
towards
the
door
as
she
is
about
to
go
out
he
bursts
into
a
peal
of
laughter
she
stops
with
a
start
and
looks
at
him
his
laughter
grows
peal
upon
peal
it
becomes
wild
and
shrill
and
hysterical
he
bellows
with
laughter
already
half
frightened

back
into
the
catherine

into
uncontrolled
catherine

glass
of
wine

at
a
george

george
winter
your
going
