adeline
mowbray
or
the
mother
and
daughter
mrs
opie
chapter
i
in
an
old
family
mansion
situated
on
an
estate
in
gloucestershire
known
by
the
name
of
rosevalley
resided
mrs
mowbray
and
adeline
her
only
child
mrs
mowbray
father
mr
woodville
a
respectable
country
gentleman
married
in
obedience
to
the
will
of
his
mother
the
sole
surviving
daughter
of
an
opulent
merchant
in
london
whose
large
dower
paid
off
some
considerable
mortgages
on
the
woodville
estates
and
whose
mild
and
unoffending
character
soon
gained
that
affection
from
her
husband
after
marriage
which
he
denied
her
before
it
nor
was
it
long
before
their
happiness
was
increased
and
their
union
cemented
by
the
birth
of
a
daughter
who
continuing
to
be
an
only
child
and
the
probable
heiress
of
great
possessions
became
the
idol
of
her
parents
and
the
object
of
unremitted
attention
to
those
who
surrounded
her
consequently
one
of
the
first
lessons
which
editha
woodville
learnt
was
that
of
egotism
and
to
consider
it
as
the
chief
duty
of
all
who
approached
her
to
study
the
gratification
of
her
whims
and
caprices
but
though
rendered
indolent
in
some
measure
by
the
blind
folly
of
her
parents
and
the
homage
of
her
dependents
she
had
a
taste
above
the
enjoyments
which
they
offered
her
she
had
a
decided
passion
for
literature
which
she
had
acquired
from
a
sister
of
mr
woodville
who
had
been
brought
up
amongst
literary
characters
of
various
pursuits
and
opinions
and
this
lady
had
imbibed
from
them
a
love
of
free
inquiry
which
she
had
little
difficulty
in
imparting
to
her
young
and
enthusiastic
relation
but
alas
that
inclination
for
study
which
had
it
been
directed
to
proper
objects
would
have
been
the
charm
of
miss
woodville
life
and
the
safeguard
of
her
happiness
by
giving
her
a
constant
source
of
amusement
within
herself
proved
to
her
from
the
unfortunate
direction
which
it
took
the
abundant
cause
of
misery
and
disappointment
for
her
history
biography
poetry
and
discoveries
in
natural
philosophy
had
few
attractions
while
she
pored
with
still
unsatisfied
delight
over
abstruse
systems
of
morals
and
metaphysics
or
new
theories
in
politics
and
scarcely
a
week
elapsed
in
which
she
did
not
receive
from
her
aunt
bookseller
in
london
various
tracts
on
these
her
favourite
subjects
happy
would
it
have
been
for
miss
woodville
if
the
merits
of
the
works
which
she
so
much
admired
could
have
been
canvassed
in
her
presence
by
rational
and
unprejudiced
persons
but
her
parents
and
friends
being
too
ignorant
to
discuss
philosophical
opinions
or
political
controversies
the
young
speculator
was
left
to
the
decision
of
her
own
inexperienced
enthusiasm
to
her
therefore
whatever
was
bold
and
uncommon
seemed
new
and
wise
and
every
succeeding
theory
held
her
imagination
captive
till
its
power
was
weakened
by
one
of
equal
claims
to
singularity
she
soon
however
ceased
to
be
contented
with
reading
and
was
eager
to
become
a
writer
also
but
as
she
was
strongly
imbued
with
the
prejudices
of
an
ancient
family
she
could
not
think
of
disgracing
that
family
by
turning
professed
author
she
therefore
confined
her
little
effusions
to
a
society
of
admiring
friends
secretly
lamenting
the
loss
which
the
literary
world
sustained
in
her
being
born
a
gentlewoman
nor
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
as
she
was
ambitious
to
be
and
to
be
thought
a
deep
thinker
she
should
have
acquired
habits
of
abstraction
and
absence
which
imparted
a
look
of
wildness
to
a
pair
of
dark
eyes
that
beamed
with
intelligence
and
gave
life
to
features
of
the
most
perfect
regularity
to
reverie
indeed
she
was
from
childhood
inclined
and
her
life
was
long
a
life
of
reverie
to
her
the
present
moment
had
scarcely
ever
existence
and
this
propensity
to
lose
herself
in
a
sort
of
ideal
world
was
considerably
increased
by
the
nature
of
her
studies
fatal
and
unproductive
studies
while
wrapt
in
philosophical
abstraction
she
was
trying
to
understand
a
metaphysical
question
on
the
mechanism
of
the
human
mind
or
what
constituted
the
true
nature
of
virtue
she
suffered
day
after
day
to
pass
in
the
culpable
neglect
of
positive
duties
and
while
imagining
systems
for
the
good
of
society
and
the
furtherance
of
general
philanthropy
she
allowed
individual
suffering
in
her
neighbourhood
to
pass
unobserved
and
unrelieved
while
professing
her
unbounded
love
for
the
great
family
of
the
world
she
suffered
her
own
family
to
pine
under
the
consciousness
of
her
neglect
and
viciously
devoted
those
hours
to
the
vanity
of
abstruse
and
solitary
study
which
might
have
been
better
spent
in
amusing
the
declining
age
of
her
venerable
parents
whom
affection
had
led
to
take
up
their
abode
with
her
let
me
observe
before
i
proceed
further
that
mrs
mowbray
scrupulously
confined
herself
to
theory
even
in
her
wisest
speculations
and
being
too
timid
and
too
indolent
to
illustrate
by
her
conduct
the
various
and
opposing
doctrines
which
it
was
her
pride
to
maintain
by
turns
her
practice
was
ever
in
opposition
to
her
opinions
hence
after
haranguing
with
all
the
violence
of
a
true
whig
on
the
natural
rights
of
man
or
the
blessings
of
freedom
she
would
to
a
tory
in
her
elbow
chair
and
govern
her
household
with
despotic
authority
and
after
embracing
at
some
moments
the
doubts
of
the
sceptic
she
would
often
lie
motionless
in
her
bed
from
apprehension
of
ghosts
a
helpless
prey
to
the
most
abject
superstition
such
was
the
mother
of
adeline
mowbray
such
was
the
woman
who
having
married
the
heir
of
rosevalley
merely
to
oblige
her
parents
saw
herself
in
the
prime
of
life
a
rich
widow
with
an
only
child
who
was
left
by
mr
mowbray
a
fond
husband
but
an
parent
entirely
dependent
on
her
at
the
time
of
mr
mowbray
death
adeline
mowbray
was
ten
years
old
and
mrs
mowbray
thirty
and
like
an
animal
in
an
exhausted
receiver
she
had
during
her
short
existence
been
tormented
by
the
experimental
philosophy
of
her
mother
now
it
was
judged
right
that
she
should
learn
nothing
and
now
that
she
should
learn
every
thing
now
her
graceful
form
and
limbs
were
to
be
free
from
any
bandage
and
any
clothing
save
what
decency
required
and
now
they
were
to
be
tortured
by
stiff
stays
and
fettered
by
the
stocks
and
the
all
mrs
mowbray
ambition
had
settled
in
one
point
one
passion
and
that
was
education
for
this
purpose
she
turned
over
innumerable
volumes
in
search
of
rules
on
the
subject
on
which
she
might
improve
anticipating
with
great
satisfaction
the
moment
when
she
should
be
held
up
as
a
pattern
of
imitation
to
mothers
and
be
prevailed
upon
though
with
graceful
reluctance
to
publish
her
system
without
a
name
for
the
benefit
of
society
but
however
good
her
intentions
were
the
execution
of
them
was
continually
delayed
by
her
habits
of
abstraction
and
reverie
after
having
over
night
arranged
the
tasks
of
adeline
for
the
next
day
lost
in
some
new
speculations
for
the
good
of
her
child
she
would
lie
in
bed
all
the
morning
exposing
that
child
to
the
dangers
of
idleness
at
one
time
mrs
mowbray
had
studied
herself
into
great
nicety
with
regard
to
the
diet
of
her
daughter
but
as
she
herself
was
too
much
used
to
the
indulgences
of
the
palate
to
be
able
to
set
her
in
reality
an
example
of
temperance
she
dined
in
appearance
with
adeline
at
one
on
pudding
without
butter
and
potatoes
without
salt
but
while
the
child
was
taking
her
afternoon
walk
her
own
table
was
covered
with
viands
fitted
for
the
appetite
of
opulence
unfortunately
however
the
servants
conceived
that
the
daughter
as
well
as
the
mother
had
a
right
to
regale
clandestinely
and
the
little
adeline
used
to
eat
for
her
supper
with
a
charge
not
to
tell
her
mamma
some
of
the
good
things
set
by
from
mrs
mowbray
dinner
it
happened
that
as
mrs
mowbray
was
one
evening
smoothing
flowing
curls
and
stroking
her
ruddy
cheek
she
exclaimed
triumphantly
raising
adeline
to
the
glass
the
effect
of
temperance
and
low
living
if
you
were
accustomed
to
eat
meat
and
butter
and
drink
any
thing
but
water
you
would
not
look
so
healthy
my
love
as
you
do
now
o
the
excellent
effects
of
a
vegetable
diet
the
artless
girl
whose
conscience
smote
her
during
the
whole
of
this
speech
hung
her
blushing
head
on
her
bosom
it
was
the
confusion
of
guilt
and
mrs
mowbray
perceiving
it
earnestly
demanded
what
it
meant
when
adeline
half
crying
gave
a
full
explanation
nothing
could
exceed
the
astonishment
and
mortification
of
mrs
mowbray
but
though
usually
tenacious
of
her
opinions
she
in
this
case
profited
by
the
lesson
of
experience
she
no
longer
expected
any
advantage
from
clandestine
measures
but
adeline
her
appetites
regulated
by
a
proper
exertion
of
parental
authority
was
allowed
to
sit
at
the
table
of
her
mother
and
was
precluded
by
a
judicious
and
open
indulgence
from
wishing
for
a
secret
and
improper
one
while
the
judicious
praises
which
mrs
mowbray
bestowed
on
adeline
ingenuous
confession
endeared
to
her
the
practice
of
truth
and
laid
the
foundation
of
a
habit
of
ingenuousness
which
formed
through
life
one
of
the
ornaments
of
her
character
would
that
mrs
mowbray
had
always
been
equally
judicious
another
great
object
of
anxiety
to
her
was
the
method
of
clothing
children
whether
they
should
wear
flannel
or
no
flannel
light
shoes
to
give
agility
to
the
motions
of
the
limbs
or
heavy
shoes
in
order
to
strengthen
the
muscles
by
exertion
when
one
day
as
she
was
turning
over
a
voluminous
author
on
this
subject
the
nurserymaid
hastily
entered
the
room
and
claimed
her
attention
but
in
vain
mrs
mowbray
went
on
reading
aloud
persons
are
of
opinion
that
thin
shoes
are
most
beneficial
to
health
others
equally
worthy
of
respect
think
thick
ones
of
most
use
and
the
reasons
for
these
different
opinions
we
shall
class
under
two
heads
me
cried
bridget
in
the
meantime
miss
adeline
will
go
without
any
shoes
at
all
not
interrupt
me
bridget
cried
mrs
mowbray
and
proceeded
to
read
on
the
first
place
it
is
not
clear
says
a
learned
writer
whether
children
require
any
clothing
at
all
for
their
feet
at
this
moment
adeline
burst
open
the
parlour
door
and
crying
bitterly
held
up
her
bleeding
toes
to
her
mother
mamma
cried
she
forget
to
send
for
a
pair
of
new
shoes
for
me
and
see
how
the
stones
in
the
gravel
have
cut
me
this
sight
this
appeal
decided
the
question
in
dispute
the
feet
of
adeline
bleeding
on
a
new
turkey
carpet
proved
that
some
clothing
for
the
feet
was
necessary
and
even
mrs
mowbray
for
a
moment
began
to
suspect
that
a
little
experience
is
better
than
a
great
deal
of
theory
chapter
ii
meanwhile
in
spite
of
all
mrs
mowbray
eccentricities
and
caprices
adeline
as
she
grew
up
continued
to
entertain
for
her
the
most
perfect
respect
and
affection
her
respect
was
excited
by
the
high
idea
which
she
had
formed
of
her
abilities
an
idea
founded
on
the
veneration
which
all
the
family
seemed
to
feel
for
her
on
that
account
and
her
affection
was
excited
even
to
an
enthusiastic
degree
by
the
tenderness
with
which
mrs
mowbray
had
watched
over
her
during
an
alarming
illness
for
days
adeline
had
been
in
the
utmost
danger
nor
is
it
probable
that
she
would
have
been
able
to
struggle
against
the
force
of
the
disease
but
for
the
unremitting
attention
of
her
mother
it
was
then
perhaps
for
the
first
time
that
mrs
mowbray
felt
herself
a
mother
all
her
vanities
all
her
systems
were
forgotten
in
the
danger
of
adeline
she
did
not
even
hazard
an
opinion
on
the
medical
treatment
to
be
observed
for
once
she
was
contented
to
obey
instructions
in
silence
for
once
she
was
never
caught
in
a
reverie
but
like
the
most
woman
of
her
acquaintance
she
lived
to
the
present
moment
and
she
was
rewarded
for
her
cares
by
the
recovery
of
her
daughter
and
by
that
daughter
most
devoted
attachment
not
even
the
parents
of
mrs
mowbray
who
because
she
talked
on
subjects
which
they
could
not
understand
looked
up
to
her
as
a
superior
being
could
exceed
adeline
in
deference
to
her
mother
abilities
and
when
as
she
advanced
in
life
she
was
sometimes
tempted
to
think
her
deficient
in
maternal
fondness
the
idea
of
mrs
mowbray
bending
with
pale
and
speechless
anxiety
over
her
sleepless
pillow
used
to
recur
to
her
remembrance
and
in
a
moment
the
recent
indifference
was
forgotten
nor
could
she
entirely
acquit
herself
of
ingratitude
in
observing
this
seeming
indifference
for
whence
did
the
abstraction
and
apparent
coldness
of
mrs
mowbray
proceed
from
her
mind
being
wholly
engrossed
in
studies
for
the
future
benefit
of
adeline
why
did
she
leave
the
concerns
of
her
family
to
others
why
did
she
allow
her
infirm
but
active
mother
to
superintend
all
the
household
duties
and
why
did
she
seclude
herself
from
all
society
save
that
of
her
own
family
and
dr
norberry
her
physician
and
friend
but
that
she
might
devote
every
hour
to
endeavours
to
perfect
a
system
of
education
for
her
beloved
and
only
daughter
to
whom
the
work
was
to
be
dedicated
yet
said
adeline
mentally
am
so
ungrateful
sometimes
as
to
think
she
does
not
love
me
sufficiently
but
while
mrs
mowbray
was
busying
herself
in
plans
for
education
she
reached
the
age
of
fifteen
and
was
in
a
manner
educated
not
however
by
her
though
mrs
mowbray
would
no
doubt
have
been
surprised
to
have
heard
this
assertion
mrs
mowbray
as
i
have
before
said
was
the
spoiled
child
of
rich
parents
who
as
geniuses
were
rarer
in
those
days
than
they
are
now
spite
of
their
own
ignorance
rejoiced
to
find
themselves
the
parents
of
a
genius
and
as
their
daughter
always
disliked
the
usual
occupations
of
her
sex
the
admiring
father
and
mother
contented
themselves
with
allowing
her
to
please
herself
say
to
each
other
must
not
be
managed
in
a
common
way
for
you
know
my
dear
she
is
one
of
your
geniuses
and
they
are
never
like
other
folks
mrs
woodville
the
mother
had
been
brought
up
with
all
the
ideas
of
economy
and
housewifery
which
at
that
time
of
day
prevailed
in
the
city
and
influenced
the
education
of
the
daughters
of
citizens
dear
said
she
one
day
to
adeline
you
are
no
genius
you
know
like
your
mother
and
god
forbid
you
should
for
one
is
quite
enough
in
a
family
i
shall
make
bold
to
teach
you
every
thing
that
young
women
in
my
young
days
used
to
learn
and
my
daughter
may
thank
me
for
it
some
time
or
other
for
you
know
my
dear
when
i
and
my
good
man
die
what
in
the
world
would
come
of
my
poor
edith
if
so
be
she
had
no
one
to
manage
for
her
for
lord
love
you
she
knows
no
more
of
managing
a
family
and
than
a
newborn
babe
can
you
dear
grandmother
teach
me
to
be
of
use
to
my
mother
said
adeline
be
sure
child
for
as
you
are
no
genius
no
doubt
you
can
learn
all
them
sort
of
things
that
women
commonly
know
so
we
will
begin
directly
in
a
short
time
adeline
stimulated
by
the
ambition
of
being
useful
for
she
had
often
heard
her
mother
assert
that
utility
was
the
foundation
of
all
virtue
became
as
expert
in
household
affairs
as
mrs
woodville
herself
even
the
department
of
making
pastry
was
now
given
up
to
adeline
and
the
servants
always
came
to
her
for
orders
saying
that
their
mistress
was
a
learned
lady
and
that
and
so
could
not
be
spoken
with
except
here
and
there
on
occasion
they
wished
their
young
mistress
who
was
more
easy
spoken
would
please
to
order
and
as
mr
and
mrs
woodville
infirmities
increased
every
day
adeline
soon
thought
it
right
to
assume
the
entire
management
of
the
family
she
also
took
upon
herself
the
office
of
almoner
to
mrs
woodville
and
performed
it
with
an
activity
unknown
to
her
for
she
herself
carried
the
broth
and
wine
that
were
to
comfort
the
infirm
cottager
she
herself
saw
the
medicine
properly
administered
that
was
to
preserve
his
suffering
existence
the
comforts
the
poor
required
she
purchased
herself
and
in
sickness
she
visited
in
sorrow
she
wept
with
them
and
though
adeline
was
almost
unknown
personally
to
the
neighbouring
gentry
she
was
followed
with
blessings
by
the
surrounding
cottagers
while
many
a
humble
peasant
watched
at
the
gate
of
the
park
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
young
benefactress
and
pray
to
god
to
repay
to
the
heiress
of
rosevalley
the
kindness
which
she
had
shown
to
him
and
his
offspring
thus
happy
because
usefully
employed
and
thus
beloved
and
respected
because
actively
benevolent
passed
the
early
years
of
adeline
mowbray
and
thus
was
she
educated
before
her
mother
had
completed
her
system
of
education
it
was
not
long
before
adeline
took
on
herself
a
still
more
important
office
mrs
mowbray
steward
was
detected
in
very
dishonest
practices
but
as
she
was
too
much
devoted
to
her
studies
to
like
to
look
into
her
affairs
with
a
view
to
dismiss
him
she
could
not
be
prevailed
on
to
discharge
him
from
her
service
fortunately
however
her
father
on
his
made
it
his
request
that
she
would
do
so
and
mrs
mowbray
pledged
herself
to
obey
him
what
shall
i
do
for
a
steward
in
davison
place
said
she
soon
after
her
father
died
one
absolutely
necessary
returned
adeline
modestly
farmer
jenkins
would
undertake
to
do
all
that
is
necessary
for
half
the
money
and
if
he
were
properly
overlooked
pray
who
can
overlook
him
properly
asked
mrs
mowbray
grandmother
and
i
replied
adeline
timidly
both
like
business
and
business
but
what
do
you
know
of
it
cried
mrs
woodville
daughter
lina
is
very
clever
at
it
i
assure
you
she
knows
nothing
yet
of
accounts
me
how
mistaken
you
are
child
she
knows
accounts
perfectly
well
replied
mrs
mowbray
should
have
taught
her
i
have
been
inventing
an
easy
method
of
learning
arithmetic
by
which
i
was
going
to
teach
her
in
a
few
months
child
but
i
thinking
it
a
pity
that
the
poor
girl
should
learn
nothing
like
till
she
was
to
learn
every
thing
taught
her
according
to
the
old
way
and
i
can
not
but
say
she
took
to
it
very
kindly
did
not
you
lina
grandmother
said
adeline
as
i
love
arithmetic
very
much
i
am
quite
anxious
to
keep
all
my
mother
accounts
and
overlook
the
accounts
of
the
person
whom
she
shall
employ
to
manage
her
estates
in
future
to
this
mrs
mowbray
half
pleased
and
half
mortified
at
length
consented
and
adeline
and
farmer
jenkins
entered
upon
their
occupations
shortly
after
mrs
woodville
was
seized
with
her
last
illness
and
adeline
neglected
every
other
duty
and
mrs
mowbray
her
studies
watch
and
weep
beside
a
parent
bed
but
watch
and
weep
was
all
that
mrs
mowbray
did
with
every
possible
wish
to
be
useful
she
had
so
long
given
way
to
habits
of
abstraction
and
neglect
of
everyday
occupations
that
she
was
rather
a
hindrance
than
a
help
in
the
sick
room
during
adeline
illness
excessive
fear
of
losing
her
only
child
had
indeed
awakened
her
to
unusual
exertion
and
as
all
that
she
had
to
do
was
to
get
down
at
stated
times
a
certain
quantity
of
wine
and
nourishment
her
task
though
wearisome
was
not
difficult
but
to
sooth
the
declining
hours
of
an
aged
parent
to
please
the
capricious
appetite
of
decay
to
assist
with
ready
and
skilful
alacrity
the
shaking
hand
of
the
invalid
jealous
of
waiting
on
herself
and
wanting
to
be
cheated
into
being
waited
upon
these
trifling
yet
important
details
did
not
suit
the
habits
of
mrs
mowbray
but
adeline
was
versed
in
them
all
and
her
mother
conscious
of
her
superiority
in
these
things
was
at
last
contented
to
sit
by
inactive
though
not
unmoved
one
day
when
mrs
mowbray
had
been
prevailed
upon
to
lie
down
for
an
hour
or
two
in
another
apartment
and
adeline
was
administering
to
mrs
woodville
some
broth
which
she
had
made
herself
the
old
lady
pressed
her
hand
affectionately
and
cried
child
in
a
lucky
hour
i
made
bold
to
interfere
and
teach
you
what
your
mother
was
too
clever
to
learn
wise
was
i
to
think
one
genius
enough
in
a
family
else
what
should
i
have
done
now
my
daughter
though
the
best
child
in
the
world
could
never
have
made
such
nice
broth
as
this
to
comfort
me
so
hot
and
boiled
to
a
minute
like
bless
her
she
have
tried
that
she
would
but
ten
to
one
but
she
have
smoked
it
overturned
it
and
scalt
her
fingers
into
the
ah
lina
lina
mayhap
the
time
will
come
when
you
should
you
have
a
sick
husband
or
a
child
to
nurse
may
bless
your
poor
grandmother
for
having
taught
you
to
be
useful
grandmother
said
adeline
tenderly
time
has
come
i
am
you
see
useful
to
you
and
therefore
i
bless
you
already
for
having
taught
me
to
be
so
girl
good
girl
just
what
i
would
have
you
and
forgive
me
lina
when
i
own
that
i
have
often
thanked
god
for
not
making
you
a
genius
not
but
what
no
child
can
behave
better
than
mine
for
with
all
her
wit
and
learning
she
was
always
so
respectful
and
so
kind
to
me
and
my
dear
good
man
that
i
am
sure
i
could
not
but
rejoice
in
such
a
daughter
though
to
be
sure
i
used
to
wish
she
was
more
conversible
like
for
as
to
the
matter
of
a
bit
of
chat
we
never
gossiped
together
in
our
lives
and
though
to
be
sure
the
squires
ladies
about
are
none
of
the
brightest
and
not
to
compare
with
my
edith
yet
still
they
would
have
done
for
me
and
my
dear
good
man
to
gossip
a
bit
with
so
i
was
vexed
when
my
daughter
declared
she
wanted
all
her
time
for
her
studies
and
would
not
visit
any
body
no
not
even
mrs
norberry
who
is
to
be
sure
a
very
good
sort
of
a
woman
though
a
little
given
to
speak
ill
of
her
neighbours
but
then
so
we
are
all
you
know
and
as
i
say
why
if
one
spoke
well
of
all
alike
what
would
be
the
use
of
one
person
being
better
than
his
neighbours
except
for
conscience
sake
but
as
i
was
going
to
say
my
daughter
was
pleased
to
compliment
me
and
declare
she
was
sure
i
could
amuse
myself
without
visiting
women
so
much
inferior
to
me
and
she
advised
my
beginning
a
course
of
study
as
she
called
it
did
you
asked
adeline
with
surprise
to
oblige
her
my
good
man
and
i
began
to
read
one
mr
locke
on
the
conduct
of
the
human
understanding
which
my
daughter
said
would
teach
us
to
think
think
said
adeline
now
you
must
know
my
poor
husband
did
not
look
upon
it
as
very
respectful
like
in
edith
to
say
that
because
it
seemed
to
say
that
we
had
lived
all
these
years
without
having
thought
at
all
which
was
not
true
to
be
sure
because
we
were
never
thoughtless
like
and
my
husband
was
so
staid
when
a
boy
that
he
was
called
a
little
old
man
i
am
sure
said
adeline
half
smiling
my
mother
did
not
mean
to
insinuate
that
you
wanted
proper
thought
i
dare
say
not
resumed
the
old
lady
so
i
told
my
husband
and
so
we
set
to
study
this
book
but
dear
me
it
was
hebrew
greek
to
us
and
so
dull
you
did
not
get
through
it
i
suppose
it
bless
your
heart
no
not
three
pages
so
my
good
man
says
to
edith
says
he
you
gave
us
this
book
i
think
child
to
teach
us
to
think
yes
sir
says
she
and
it
has
taught
us
to
think
says
he
it
has
taught
us
to
think
that
it
is
very
dull
and
disagreeable
so
my
daughter
laughed
and
said
her
father
was
witty
but
poor
soul
he
did
not
mean
it
then
as
to
amuse
us
we
liked
to
look
at
the
stars
sometimes
she
told
us
we
had
better
learn
their
names
and
study
astronomy
and
so
we
began
that
but
that
was
just
as
bad
as
mr
locke
and
we
knew
no
more
of
the
stars
and
planets
than
the
man
in
the
moon
yet
that
not
right
to
say
neither
for
as
he
is
so
much
nearer
the
stars
he
must
know
more
about
them
than
any
one
whomsoever
so
at
last
my
daughter
found
out
that
learning
was
not
our
taste
so
she
left
us
to
please
ourselves
and
play
cribbage
and
draughts
in
an
evening
as
usual
here
the
old
lady
paused
and
adeline
said
affectionately
grandmother
i
doubt
you
exert
yourself
too
much
so
much
talking
be
good
for
you
yes
child
replied
woodville
is
no
trouble
at
all
to
me
i
assure
you
but
quite
natural
and
pleasant
like
besides
you
know
i
shall
not
be
able
to
talk
much
longer
so
let
me
make
the
most
of
my
time
now
this
speech
brought
tears
into
the
eyes
of
adeline
and
seeing
her
mother
the
room
she
withdrew
to
conceal
the
emotion
which
she
felt
lest
the
cheerful
loquacity
of
the
invalid
which
she
was
fond
of
indulging
should
be
checked
by
seeing
her
tears
but
it
had
already
received
a
check
from
the
presence
of
mrs
mowbray
of
whose
superior
abilities
mrs
woodville
was
so
much
in
awe
that
concluding
her
daughter
could
not
bear
to
hear
her
nonsense
the
old
lady
smiled
kindly
on
her
when
with
a
look
of
tender
anxiety
she
hastened
to
her
bedside
and
then
holding
her
hand
composed
herself
to
sleep
in
a
few
days
more
she
breathed
her
last
on
the
supporting
arm
of
adeline
and
lamented
in
her
dying
moments
that
she
had
nothing
valuable
in
money
to
leave
in
order
to
show
adeline
how
sensible
she
was
of
her
affectionate
attentions
you
are
an
only
child
she
added
all
your
mother
has
will
be
yours
doubt
observed
mrs
mowbray
eagerly
and
her
mother
died
contented
chapter
iii
at
this
period
adeline
ambition
had
led
her
to
form
new
plans
which
mrs
woodville
death
left
her
at
liberty
to
put
in
execution
whenever
the
old
lady
reminded
her
that
she
was
no
genius
adeline
had
felt
as
much
degraded
as
if
she
had
said
that
she
was
no
conjuror
and
though
she
was
too
humble
to
suppose
that
she
could
ever
equal
her
mother
she
was
resolved
to
try
to
make
herself
more
worthy
of
her
by
imitating
her
in
those
pursuits
and
studies
on
which
were
founded
mrs
pretensions
to
superior
talents
she
therefore
made
it
her
business
to
inquire
what
those
studies
and
pursuits
were
and
finding
that
mrs
mowbray
noted
superiority
was
built
on
her
passion
for
abstruse
speculations
adeline
eagerly
devoted
her
leisure
hours
to
similar
studies
but
unfortunately
these
new
theories
and
these
romantic
reveries
which
only
served
to
amuse
mrs
mowbray
fancy
her
more
enthusiastic
daughter
resolved
to
make
conscientiously
the
rules
of
her
practice
and
while
mrs
mowbray
expended
her
eccentric
philosophy
in
words
as
mr
shandy
did
his
grief
adeline
carefully
treasured
up
hers
in
her
heart
to
be
manifested
only
by
its
fruits
one
author
in
particular
by
a
train
of
reasoning
captivating
though
sophistical
and
plausible
though
absurd
made
her
a
delighted
convert
to
his
opinions
and
prepared
her
young
and
impassioned
heart
for
the
practice
of
vice
by
filling
her
mind
ardent
in
the
love
of
virtue
with
new
and
singular
opinions
on
the
subject
of
moral
duty
on
the
works
of
this
writer
adeline
had
often
heard
her
mother
descant
in
terms
of
the
highest
praise
but
she
did
not
feel
herself
so
completely
his
convert
on
her
own
conviction
till
she
had
experienced
the
fatal
fascination
of
his
style
and
been
conveyed
by
his
bewitching
pen
from
the
world
as
it
is
into
a
world
as
it
to
be
this
writer
whose
name
was
glenmurray
amongst
other
institutions
attacked
the
institution
of
marriage
and
after
having
elaborately
pointed
out
its
folly
and
its
wickedness
he
drew
so
delightful
a
picture
of
the
superior
purity
as
well
as
happiness
of
an
union
cemented
by
no
ties
but
those
of
love
and
honour
that
adeline
wrought
to
the
highest
pitch
of
enthusiasm
for
a
new
order
of
things
entered
into
a
solemn
compact
with
herself
to
act
when
she
was
introduced
into
society
according
to
the
rules
laid
down
by
this
writer
unfortunately
for
her
she
had
no
opportunity
of
hearing
these
opinions
combated
by
the
good
sense
and
sober
experience
of
dr
norberry
then
their
sole
visitant
for
at
this
time
the
american
war
was
the
object
of
attention
to
all
europe
and
as
mrs
mowbray
as
well
as
dr
norberry
were
deeply
interested
in
this
subject
they
scarcely
ever
talked
on
any
other
and
even
glenmurray
and
his
theories
were
driven
from
mrs
mowbray
remembrance
by
political
tracts
and
the
eager
anxieties
of
a
politician
nor
had
she
even
leisure
to
observe
that
while
she
was
feeling
all
the
generous
anxiety
of
a
citizen
of
the
world
for
the
sons
and
daughters
of
american
independence
her
own
child
was
imbibing
through
her
means
opinions
dangerous
to
her
as
a
member
of
any
civilized
society
and
laying
perhaps
the
foundation
to
herself
and
her
mother
of
future
misery
and
disgrace
alas
the
astrologer
in
the
fable
was
but
too
like
mrs
mowbray
but
even
had
adeline
had
an
opportunity
of
discussing
her
new
opinions
with
dr
norberry
it
is
not
at
all
certain
that
she
would
have
had
the
power
mrs
mowbray
was
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
a
woman
and
loved
the
information
which
she
acquired
less
for
its
own
sake
than
for
the
supposed
importance
which
it
gave
her
amongst
her
acquaintance
and
the
means
of
displaying
her
superiority
over
other
women
before
she
secluded
herself
from
society
in
order
to
study
education
she
had
been
the
terror
of
the
ladies
in
the
neighbourhood
since
despising
small
talk
she
would
always
insist
on
making
the
gentlemen
of
her
acquaintance
as
much
terrified
sometimes
as
their
wives
engage
with
her
in
some
literary
or
political
conversation
she
wanted
to
convert
every
into
an
arena
for
the
mind
and
all
her
guests
into
intellectual
gladiators
she
was
often
heard
to
interrupt
two
grave
matrons
in
an
interesting
discussion
of
an
accouchement
by
asking
them
if
they
had
read
a
new
theological
tract
or
a
pamphlet
against
the
minister
if
they
softly
expatiated
on
the
fatigue
of
body
which
they
had
endured
she
discoursed
in
choice
terms
on
the
energies
of
the
mind
and
she
never
received
or
paid
visits
without
convincing
the
company
that
she
was
the
most
wise
most
learned
and
most
disagreeable
of
companions
but
adeline
on
the
contrary
studied
merely
from
the
love
of
study
and
not
with
a
view
to
shine
in
conversation
nor
dared
she
venture
to
expatiate
on
subjects
which
she
had
often
heard
mrs
woodville
say
were
very
rarely
canvassed
or
even
alluded
to
by
women
she
remained
silent
therefore
on
the
subject
nearest
her
heart
from
choice
as
well
as
necessity
in
the
presence
of
dr
norberry
till
at
length
she
imbibed
the
political
mania
herself
and
soon
found
it
impossible
to
conceal
the
interest
which
she
took
in
the
success
of
the
infant
republic
she
therefore
one
day
put
into
the
doctor
hands
some
which
she
had
written
on
some
recent
victory
of
the
american
arms
exclaiming
with
a
smile
too
am
a
politician
and
was
rewarded
by
an
exclamation
of
girl
i
protest
you
are
as
clever
as
your
mother
this
unexpected
declaration
fixed
her
in
the
path
of
literary
ambition
and
though
wisely
resolved
to
fulfil
as
usual
every
feminine
duty
adeline
was
convinced
that
she
like
her
mother
had
a
right
to
be
an
author
a
politician
and
a
philosopher
while
dr
norberry
praises
of
her
daughter
convinced
mrs
mowbray
that
almost
unconsciously
she
had
educated
her
into
a
prodigy
and
confirmed
her
in
her
intention
of
exhibiting
herself
and
adeline
to
the
admiring
world
during
the
next
season
at
bath
for
at
bath
she
expected
to
receive
that
admiration
which
she
had
vainly
sought
in
london
soon
after
their
marriage
mr
mowbray
had
carried
his
lively
bride
to
the
metropolis
where
she
expected
to
receive
the
same
homage
which
had
been
paid
to
her
charms
at
the
in
her
neighbourhood
what
then
must
have
been
her
disappointment
when
instead
of
hearing
as
she
passed
is
miss
woodville
the
rich
heiress
or
the
great
genius
or
the
great
beauty
or
is
the
beautiful
mrs
mowbray
she
walked
unknown
and
unobserved
in
public
and
in
private
and
found
herself
of
as
little
importance
in
the
wide
world
of
the
metropolis
as
the
most
humble
of
her
acquaintance
in
a
country
true
she
had
beauty
but
then
it
was
by
fashion
nay
more
it
was
eclipsed
by
unfashionable
and
tasteless
attire
and
her
manner
though
stately
and
imposing
in
an
assembly
where
she
was
known
was
wholly
unlike
the
manners
of
the
world
and
in
a
london
party
appeared
arrogant
and
offensive
her
remarks
too
wise
as
they
appeared
to
her
and
mr
mowbray
excited
little
attention
as
the
few
persons
to
whom
they
were
known
in
the
metropolis
were
wholly
ignorant
of
her
high
pretensions
and
knew
not
that
they
were
discoursing
with
a
professed
genius
and
the
oracle
of
a
provincial
circle
some
persons
indeed
surprised
at
hearing
from
the
lips
of
eighteen
observations
on
morals
theology
and
politics
listened
to
her
with
wonder
and
even
attention
but
turned
away
observing
things
is
true
are
neither
new
nor
rare
the
only
wonder
is
how
they
got
there
till
at
length
disappointed
mortified
and
disgusted
mrs
mowbray
impatiently
returned
to
rosevalley
where
in
beauty
in
learning
and
in
grandeur
she
was
unrivalled
and
where
she
might
deal
out
her
dogmas
sure
of
exciting
respectful
attention
however
she
might
fail
of
calling
for
a
more
flattering
tribute
from
her
auditors
but
in
the
narrower
field
of
bath
she
expected
to
shine
forth
with
greater
éclat
than
in
london
and
to
obtain
admiration
more
worthy
of
her
acceptance
than
any
which
a
country
circle
could
offer
to
bath
therefore
she
prepared
to
go
and
the
young
heart
of
adeline
beat
high
with
pleasure
at
the
idea
of
mixing
with
that
busy
world
which
her
fancy
had
often
clothed
in
the
most
winning
attractions
but
her
joy
and
mrs
mowbray
was
a
little
at
the
moment
of
their
departure
by
the
sight
of
dr
norberry
melancholy
countenance
what
was
to
be
as
they
fondly
imagined
their
gain
was
his
loss
and
with
a
full
heart
he
came
to
bid
them
adieu
for
adeline
he
had
conceived
not
only
affection
but
esteem
amounting
almost
to
veneration
for
she
appeared
to
him
to
unite
various
and
opposing
excellencies
though
possessed
of
taste
and
talents
for
literature
she
was
skilled
in
the
minutest
details
of
housewifery
and
feminine
occupations
and
at
the
same
time
she
bore
her
faculties
so
meekly
that
she
never
wounded
the
of
any
one
by
arrogating
to
herself
any
superiority
such
adeline
appeared
to
her
excellent
old
friend
and
his
affection
for
her
was
perhaps
increased
by
the
necessity
which
he
was
under
of
concealing
it
at
home
the
praises
of
mrs
mowbray
and
adeline
were
odious
to
the
ears
of
mrs
norberry
and
her
daughters
but
especially
the
praises
of
the
latter
as
the
merit
of
adeline
was
so
uniform
that
even
the
eye
of
envy
could
not
at
that
period
discover
any
thing
in
her
vulnerable
to
censure
and
as
the
sound
of
her
name
excited
in
his
family
a
number
of
bad
passions
and
corresponding
expressions
of
countenance
the
doctor
wisely
resolved
to
keep
his
feelings
with
regard
to
her
locked
up
in
his
own
bosom
but
he
persisted
in
visiting
at
the
park
daily
and
it
is
no
wonder
therefore
that
the
loss
even
for
a
few
months
of
the
society
of
its
inhabitants
should
by
him
be
anticipated
as
a
serious
calamity
cried
he
as
adeline
with
an
exulting
bound
sprung
after
her
mother
into
the
carriage
gay
and
delighted
you
are
though
my
heart
feels
sadly
queer
and
heavy
dear
friend
cried
mrs
mowbray
must
miss
your
society
wherever
i
go
wish
you
were
going
too
said
adeline
shall
often
think
of
you
girl
do
lie
replied
dr
norberry
swallowing
a
sigh
as
he
spoke
will
soon
forget
an
old
fellow
like
me
i
conclude
that
you
will
soon
forget
how
what
think
so
at
your
peril
must
think
so
as
we
usually
judge
of
others
by
ourselves
to
go
miss
well
but
drive
on
coachman
this
taking
leave
is
plaguey
disagreeable
so
shake
hands
and
be
off
they
gave
him
their
hands
which
he
pressed
very
affectionately
and
the
carriage
drove
on
am
an
old
fool
cried
the
doctor
wiping
his
eyes
as
the
carriage
disappeared
heaven
grant
sweet
innocent
that
you
may
return
to
me
as
happy
and
spotless
as
you
now
are
mrs
mowbray
had
been
married
at
a
very
early
age
and
had
accepted
in
mr
mowbray
the
first
man
who
addressed
her
consequently
that
passion
for
personal
admiration
so
natural
to
women
had
in
her
never
been
gratified
nor
even
called
forth
but
seeing
herself
at
the
age
of
possessed
of
almost
undiminished
beauty
she
recollected
that
her
charms
had
never
received
that
general
homage
for
which
nature
intended
them
and
she
who
at
twenty
had
disregarded
even
to
a
fault
the
ornaments
of
dress
was
now
at
the
age
of
eager
to
indulge
in
the
extremes
of
decoration
and
to
share
in
the
delights
of
conquest
and
admiration
with
her
youthful
and
attractive
daughter
attractive
rather
than
handsome
was
the
epithet
best
suited
to
describe
adeline
mowbray
her
beauty
was
the
beauty
of
expression
of
countenance
not
regularity
of
feature
though
the
uncommon
fairness
and
delicacy
of
her
complexion
the
lustre
of
her
hazel
eyes
her
long
dark
and
the
profusion
of
soft
light
hair
which
curled
over
the
colour
of
her
cheek
gave
her
some
pretensions
to
what
is
denominated
beauty
but
her
own
sex
declared
she
was
plain
and
perhaps
they
were
right
though
the
other
protested
against
the
decision
and
probably
they
were
right
also
but
women
criticize
in
detail
men
admire
in
the
aggregate
women
reason
and
men
feel
when
passing
judgment
on
female
beauty
and
when
a
woman
declares
another
to
be
plain
the
chances
are
that
she
is
right
in
her
opinion
as
she
can
not
from
her
being
a
woman
feel
the
charm
of
that
power
to
please
that
than
beauty
dearer
which
often
throws
a
veil
over
the
irregularity
of
features
and
obtains
for
even
a
plain
woman
from
men
at
least
the
appellation
of
pretty
whether
adeline
face
were
plain
or
not
her
form
could
defy
even
the
severity
of
female
criticism
she
was
indeed
tall
almost
to
a
masculine
degree
but
such
were
the
roundness
and
proportion
of
her
limbs
such
the
symmetry
of
her
whole
person
such
the
lightness
and
gracefulness
of
her
movements
and
so
truly
feminine
were
her
look
and
manner
that
superior
height
was
forgotten
in
the
superior
loveliness
of
her
figure
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
then
that
miss
mowbray
was
an
object
of
attention
and
admiration
at
bath
as
soon
as
she
appeared
nor
that
her
mother
had
her
share
of
flattery
and
followers
indeed
when
it
was
known
that
mrs
mowbray
was
a
rich
widow
and
adeline
dependent
upon
her
the
mother
became
in
the
eyes
of
some
people
much
more
attractive
than
her
daughter
it
was
impossible
however
that
in
such
a
place
as
bath
mrs
mowbray
and
adeline
could
make
or
rather
retain
a
general
acquaintance
their
opinions
on
most
subjects
were
so
very
different
from
those
of
the
world
and
they
were
so
little
conscious
from
the
retirement
in
which
they
lived
that
this
difference
existed
or
was
likely
to
make
them
enemies
that
not
a
day
elapsed
in
which
they
did
not
shock
the
prejudices
of
some
and
excite
the
contemptuous
pity
of
others
and
they
soon
saw
their
acquaintance
coolly
dropped
by
those
who
as
persons
of
family
and
fortune
had
on
their
first
arrival
sought
it
with
eagerness
but
this
was
not
entirely
owing
to
the
freedom
of
their
sentiments
on
politics
or
on
other
subjects
but
because
they
associated
with
a
but
obnoxious
author
a
man
whose
speculations
had
delighted
the
inquiring
but
ignorant
lover
of
novelty
terrified
the
timid
idolater
of
ancient
usages
and
excited
the
regret
of
the
cool
and
rational
observer
regret
that
eloquence
so
overwhelming
powers
of
reasoning
so
acute
activity
of
research
so
and
a
love
of
investigation
so
ardent
should
be
thrown
away
on
the
discussion
of
moral
and
political
subjects
incapable
of
teaching
the
world
to
build
up
again
with
more
beauty
and
propriety
a
fabric
which
they
were
perhaps
calculated
to
pull
down
in
short
mrs
mowbray
and
adeline
associated
with
glenmurray
that
author
over
whose
works
they
had
long
delighted
to
meditate
and
who
had
completely
led
their
imagination
captive
before
the
fascination
of
his
countenance
and
manners
had
come
in
aid
of
his
eloquence
chapter
iv
frederic
glenmurray
was
a
man
of
family
and
of
a
small
independent
estate
which
in
case
he
died
without
children
was
to
go
to
the
next
male
heir
and
to
that
heir
it
was
certain
it
would
go
as
glenmurray
on
principle
was
an
enemy
to
marriage
and
consequently
not
likely
to
have
a
child
born
in
wedlock
it
was
unfortunate
circumstance
for
glenmurray
that
with
the
ardour
of
a
young
and
inexperienced
mind
he
had
given
his
eccentric
opinions
to
the
world
as
soon
as
they
were
conceived
and
arranged
as
he
by
so
doing
prejudiced
the
world
against
him
in
so
unconquerable
a
degree
that
to
him
almost
every
door
and
heart
was
shut
and
he
by
that
means
excluded
from
every
chance
of
having
the
errors
of
his
imagination
corrected
by
the
arguments
of
the
experienced
and
enlightened
and
corrected
no
doubt
they
would
have
been
for
he
had
a
mild
and
candid
spirit
and
mind
open
to
conviction
consider
myself
he
used
to
say
a
sceptic
not
as
a
man
really
certain
of
the
truth
of
any
thing
which
he
advances
i
doubt
of
all
things
because
i
look
upon
doubt
as
the
road
to
truth
and
do
but
convince
me
what
is
the
truth
and
at
what
risk
whatever
sacrifice
i
am
ready
to
embrace
it
but
alas
neither
the
blamelessness
of
his
life
nor
even
his
active
virtue
assisted
by
the
most
courteous
manners
were
deemed
sufficient
to
counteract
the
mischievous
tendency
of
his
works
or
rather
it
was
supposed
impossible
that
his
life
could
be
blameless
and
his
seeming
virtues
sincere
and
unheard
unknown
this
unfortunate
young
man
was
excluded
from
those
circles
which
his
talents
would
have
adorned
and
forced
to
lead
a
life
of
solitude
or
associate
with
persons
unlike
to
him
in
most
things
except
in
a
passion
for
the
bold
in
theory
and
the
almost
impossible
in
practice
of
this
description
of
persons
he
soon
became
the
oracle
the
head
of
a
sect
as
it
were
and
those
tenets
which
at
first
he
embraced
and
put
forth
more
for
amusement
than
from
conviction
as
soon
as
he
began
to
suffer
on
their
account
became
as
clear
to
him
as
the
cross
to
the
christian
martyr
and
deeming
persecution
a
test
of
truth
he
considered
the
opposition
made
to
him
and
his
doctrines
not
as
the
result
of
dispassionate
reason
striving
to
correct
absurdity
but
as
selfishness
and
fear
endeavouring
to
put
out
the
light
which
showed
the
weakness
of
the
foundation
on
which
were
built
their
claims
to
exclusive
respect
when
mrs
mowbray
and
adeline
first
arrived
at
bath
the
latter
had
attracted
the
attention
and
admiration
of
colonel
mordaunt
an
irishman
of
fortune
and
an
officer
in
the
guards
and
adeline
had
not
been
insensible
to
the
charms
of
the
very
fine
person
and
engaging
manners
united
to
powers
of
conversation
which
displayed
an
excellent
understanding
improved
by
education
and
reading
but
colonel
mordaunt
was
not
a
as
it
is
called
therefore
as
soon
as
he
began
to
feel
the
influence
of
adeline
growing
too
powerful
for
his
freedom
and
to
observe
that
his
attentions
were
far
from
unpleasing
to
her
too
honourable
to
excite
an
attachment
in
her
which
he
resolved
to
combat
in
himself
he
resolved
to
fly
from
the
danger
which
he
knew
he
could
not
face
and
overcome
and
after
a
formal
but
embarrassed
adieu
to
mrs
mowbray
and
adeline
he
suddenly
left
bath
this
unexpected
departure
both
surprised
and
grieved
adeline
but
as
her
feelings
of
delicacy
were
too
strong
to
allow
her
to
sigh
for
a
man
who
evidently
had
no
thoughts
of
sighing
for
her
she
dismissed
colonel
mordaunt
from
her
remembrance
and
tried
to
find
as
much
interest
still
in
the
and
the
promenades
as
his
presence
had
given
them
nor
was
it
long
before
she
found
in
them
an
attraction
and
an
interest
stronger
than
any
which
she
had
yet
felt
it
is
naturally
to
be
supposed
that
adeline
had
often
wished
to
know
personally
an
author
whose
writings
delighted
her
as
much
as
glenmurray
had
done
and
that
her
fancy
had
often
portrayed
him
but
though
it
had
clothed
him
in
a
form
at
once
pleasing
and
respectable
still
from
an
idea
of
his
superior
wisdom
she
had
imagined
him
past
the
meridian
of
life
and
not
likely
to
excite
warmer
feelings
than
those
of
esteem
and
veneration
and
such
continued
to
be
adeline
idea
of
glenmurray
when
he
arrived
at
bath
having
been
sent
thither
by
his
physicians
for
the
benefit
of
his
health
glenmurray
though
a
sense
of
his
unpopularity
had
long
banished
him
from
scenes
of
public
resort
in
general
was
so
pleased
with
the
novelties
of
bath
that
though
he
walked
wholly
unnoticed
except
by
the
lovers
of
genius
in
whatsoever
shape
it
showed
itself
he
frequented
daily
the
and
the
promenades
and
adeline
had
long
admired
the
countenance
and
dignified
person
of
this
young
and
interesting
invalid
without
the
slightest
suspicion
of
his
being
the
man
of
all
others
whom
she
most
wished
to
see
nor
had
glenmurray
been
slow
to
admire
adeline
and
so
strong
so
irresistible
was
the
feeling
of
admiration
which
she
had
excited
in
him
that
as
soon
as
she
appeared
all
other
objects
vanished
from
his
sight
and
as
women
are
generally
to
the
effect
of
their
charms
adeline
never
beheld
the
stranger
without
a
suffusion
of
pleasurable
confusion
on
her
cheek
one
morning
at
the
when
glenmurray
unconscious
that
adeline
was
near
was
reading
the
newspaper
with
great
attention
and
adeline
for
the
first
time
was
looking
at
him
unobserved
she
heard
the
name
of
glenmurray
pronounced
and
turned
her
head
towards
the
person
who
spoke
in
hopes
of
seeing
glenmurray
himself
when
mrs
mowbray
turning
round
and
looking
at
the
invalid
said
to
a
gentleman
next
her
you
say
sir
that
that
tall
pale
dark
young
man
is
mr
glenmurray
the
celebrated
author
replied
the
gentleman
with
a
sneer
is
mr
glenmurray
the
celebrated
author
how
i
should
like
to
speak
to
him
cried
mrs
mowbray
will
be
no
difficult
matter
replied
her
informant
gentleman
is
always
quite
as
much
at
leisure
as
you
see
him
now
for
persons
have
not
the
same
taste
as
mrs
mowbray
so
saying
he
bowed
and
departed
leaving
mrs
mowbray
to
whom
the
sight
of
a
great
author
was
new
so
lost
in
contemplating
glenmurray
that
the
sarcasm
with
which
he
spoke
entirely
escaped
her
observation
nor
was
adeline
less
abstracted
she
too
was
contemplating
glenmurray
and
with
mixed
but
delightful
feelings
then
he
is
young
and
handsome
too
said
she
mentally
is
a
pity
he
looks
so
added
she
but
the
sigh
was
caused
rather
by
his
looking
so
though
adeline
was
not
conscious
of
it
by
this
time
glenmurray
had
observed
who
were
his
neighbours
and
the
newspaper
was
immediately
laid
down
there
any
news
said
mrs
mowbray
to
glenmurray
resolved
to
make
a
bold
effort
to
become
acquainted
with
him
glenmurray
with
a
bow
and
a
blush
of
mingled
surprise
and
pleasure
replied
that
there
was
a
great
deal
and
immediately
presented
to
her
the
paper
which
he
had
relinquished
setting
chairs
at
the
same
time
for
her
and
adeline
mrs
mowbray
however
only
slightly
glanced
her
eye
over
the
paper
her
desire
was
to
talk
to
glenmurray
and
in
order
to
accomplish
this
point
and
prejudice
him
in
her
favour
she
told
him
how
much
she
rejoiced
in
seeing
an
author
whose
works
were
the
delight
and
instruction
of
her
life
adeline
cried
she
turning
to
her
blushing
daughter
we
not
almost
daily
read
and
daily
admire
mr
writings
certainly
replied
adeline
unable
to
articulate
more
awed
no
doubt
by
the
presence
of
so
superior
a
being
while
glenmurray
more
proud
of
being
an
author
than
ever
said
internally
it
possible
that
that
sweet
creature
should
have
read
and
admired
my
works
but
in
vain
encouraged
by
the
smiles
and
even
by
the
blushes
of
adeline
did
he
endeavour
to
engage
her
in
conversation
adeline
was
unusually
silent
unusually
bashful
but
mrs
mowbray
made
ample
amends
for
her
deficiency
and
mr
glenmurray
flattered
and
amused
would
have
continued
to
converse
with
her
and
look
at
adeline
had
he
not
observed
the
impertinent
sneers
and
rude
laughter
to
which
conversing
so
familiarly
with
him
exposed
mrs
mowbray
as
soon
as
he
observed
this
he
arose
to
depart
for
glenmurray
was
according
to
rochefoucault
maxim
so
exquisitely
selfish
that
he
always
considered
the
welfare
of
others
before
his
own
and
heroically
sacrificing
his
own
gratification
to
save
mrs
mowbray
and
adeline
from
further
censure
he
bowed
with
the
greatest
respect
to
mrs
mowbray
sighed
as
he
paid
the
same
compliment
to
adeline
and
lamenting
his
being
forced
to
quit
them
so
soon
with
evident
reluctance
left
the
room
an
elegant
bow
he
makes
exclaimed
mrs
mowbray
adeline
had
observed
nothing
but
the
sigh
and
on
that
she
did
not
choose
to
make
any
comment
the
next
day
mrs
mowbray
having
learned
glenmurray
address
sent
him
a
card
for
a
party
at
her
lodgings
nothing
but
glenmurray
delight
could
exceed
his
astonishment
at
this
invitation
he
had
observed
mrs
mowbray
and
adeline
even
before
adeline
had
observed
him
and
as
he
gazed
upon
the
fascinating
adeline
he
had
sighed
to
think
that
she
too
would
be
taught
to
avoid
the
dangerous
and
disreputable
acquaintance
of
glenmurray
to
him
therefore
this
mark
of
attention
was
a
source
both
of
consolation
and
joy
but
being
well
convinced
that
it
was
owing
to
her
ignorance
of
the
usual
customs
and
opinions
of
those
with
whom
she
associated
he
was
too
generous
to
accept
the
invitation
as
he
knew
that
his
presence
at
a
rout
at
bath
would
cause
general
dismay
and
expose
the
mistress
to
disagreeable
remarks
at
least
but
he
endeavoured
to
make
himself
amends
for
his
by
asking
leave
to
wait
on
them
when
they
were
alone
chapter
v
a
day
or
two
after
as
adeline
was
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
young
lady
glenmurray
passed
them
and
to
his
respectful
bow
she
returned
a
most
cordial
salutation
me
my
dear
said
her
companion
you
know
who
that
man
is
it
is
mr
glenmurray
do
you
speak
to
him
why
should
i
not
me
why
i
am
sure
why
do
you
know
what
he
is
a
celebrated
writer
and
a
man
of
genius
that
may
be
miss
mowbray
but
they
say
one
should
not
notice
him
because
he
is
is
what
said
adeline
eagerly
do
not
exactly
know
what
but
i
believe
it
is
a
french
spy
or
a
jesuit
replied
adeline
laughing
i
am
used
to
have
better
evidence
against
a
person
than
a
before
i
neglect
an
acknowledged
acquaintance
therefore
with
your
leave
i
shall
turn
back
and
talk
a
little
to
poor
mr
glenmurray
it
so
happened
that
mr
heard
every
word
of
this
conversation
for
he
had
turned
round
and
followed
adeline
and
her
fair
companion
to
present
to
the
former
the
glove
which
she
had
dropped
and
as
they
were
prevented
from
proceeding
by
the
crowd
on
the
parade
which
was
assembled
to
see
some
unusual
sight
he
being
immediately
behind
them
could
distinguish
all
that
passed
so
that
adeline
turned
round
to
go
in
search
of
him
before
the
blush
of
grateful
admiration
for
her
kindness
had
left
his
cheek
she
seeks
me
because
i
am
shunned
by
others
said
glenmurray
to
himself
in
a
moment
the
world
to
him
seemed
to
contain
only
two
beings
adeline
mowbray
and
frederic
glenmurray
and
that
adeline
starting
and
blushing
with
joyful
surprise
at
seeing
him
so
near
her
was
then
coming
in
search
of
him
of
him
the
neglected
glenmurray
scarcely
could
he
refrain
catching
the
lovely
and
ungloved
hand
next
him
to
his
heart
but
he
contented
himself
with
keeping
the
glove
that
he
was
before
so
eager
to
restore
and
in
a
moment
it
was
lodged
in
his
bosom
nor
could
ca
think
what
i
have
done
with
my
glove
which
every
now
and
then
escaped
adeline
prevail
on
him
to
own
that
he
had
found
it
at
last
indeed
it
became
unnecessary
for
adeline
as
she
glanced
her
eye
towards
glenmurray
discovered
it
in
the
but
as
delicacy
forbade
her
to
declare
the
discovery
which
she
had
made
he
was
suffered
to
retain
his
prize
though
a
deep
and
sudden
blush
which
overspread
his
cheek
and
a
sudden
pause
which
she
made
in
her
conversation
convinced
glenmurray
that
she
had
detected
his
secret
perhaps
he
was
not
sorry
nor
adeline
but
certain
it
is
that
adeline
was
for
the
remainder
of
the
morning
more
lost
in
reverie
than
ever
her
mother
had
been
and
that
from
that
day
every
one
but
adeline
and
glenmurray
saw
that
they
were
mutually
enamoured
glenmurray
was
the
first
of
the
two
lovers
to
perceive
that
they
were
so
and
he
made
the
discovery
with
a
mixture
of
pain
and
pleasure
for
what
could
be
the
result
of
such
an
attachment
he
was
firmly
resolved
never
to
marry
and
it
was
very
unlikely
that
adeline
though
she
had
often
expressed
to
him
her
approbation
of
his
writings
and
opinions
should
be
willing
to
sacrifice
everything
to
love
and
become
his
mistress
but
a
circumstance
took
place
which
completely
removed
his
doubts
on
this
subject
several
weeks
had
elapsed
since
the
first
arrival
of
the
mowbrays
at
bath
and
in
that
time
almost
all
their
acquaintances
had
left
them
one
by
one
but
neither
mrs
mowbray
nor
adeline
had
paid
much
attention
to
this
circumstance
mrs
mowbray
habits
of
abstraction
as
usual
made
her
regardless
of
common
occurrences
and
to
these
were
added
the
more
delightful
reverie
occasioned
by
the
attentions
of
a
very
handsome
and
insinuating
man
and
the
influence
of
a
growing
passion
mrs
mowbray
as
we
have
before
observed
married
from
duty
not
inclination
and
to
the
passion
of
love
she
had
remained
a
total
stranger
till
she
became
acquainted
at
bath
with
sir
patrick
yes
mrs
mowbray
was
in
love
for
the
first
time
when
she
was
approaching
her
fortieth
year
and
a
woman
is
never
so
likely
to
be
the
fool
of
love
as
when
it
assails
her
late
in
life
especially
if
a
lover
be
as
great
a
novelty
to
her
as
the
passion
itself
though
not
alas
restored
to
a
second
youth
the
tender
victim
certainly
enjoys
a
second
childhood
and
exhibits
but
too
openly
all
the
little
tricks
and
of
a
girl
without
the
youthful
appearance
that
in
a
degree
excuses
them
this
was
the
case
with
mrs
mowbray
and
while
regardless
of
her
interest
and
happiness
she
was
lost
in
the
pleasing
hopes
of
marrying
the
agreeable
baronet
no
wonder
the
cold
neglect
of
her
bath
associates
was
not
seen
by
her
adeline
engrossed
also
by
the
pleasing
reveries
of
a
first
love
was
as
unconscious
of
it
as
herself
indeed
she
thought
of
nothing
but
love
and
glenmurray
else
she
could
not
have
failed
to
see
that
while
sir
patrick
attentions
and
flatteries
were
addressed
to
her
mother
his
ardent
looks
and
passionate
sighs
were
all
directed
to
herself
sir
patrick
was
a
young
irishman
of
an
old
family
but
an
encumbered
estate
and
it
was
his
wish
to
set
his
estate
free
by
marrying
a
rich
wife
and
one
as
little
disagreeable
as
possible
with
this
view
he
came
to
bath
and
in
mrs
mowbray
he
not
only
beheld
a
woman
of
large
independent
fortune
but
possessed
of
great
personal
beauty
and
young
enough
to
be
attractive
still
though
much
pleased
with
the
wealth
and
appearance
of
the
mother
he
soon
became
enamoured
of
the
daughter
person
and
had
he
not
gone
so
far
in
his
addresses
to
mrs
mowbray
as
to
make
it
impossible
she
should
willingly
transfer
him
to
adeline
and
give
her
a
fortune
at
all
adequate
to
his
wants
he
would
have
endeavoured
honourably
to
gain
her
affections
and
entered
the
lists
against
the
favoured
glenmurray
but
as
he
wanted
the
mother
wealth
he
resolved
to
pursue
his
advantage
with
her
and
trust
to
some
future
chance
for
giving
him
possession
of
the
daughter
in
his
dealings
with
men
sir
patrick
was
a
man
of
honour
in
his
dealings
with
women
completely
the
reverse
he
considered
them
as
a
race
of
subordinate
beings
and
that
if
like
horses
they
were
well
lodged
fed
and
kept
clean
they
had
no
right
to
complain
constantly
therefore
did
he
besiege
mowbray
with
his
conversation
and
adeline
with
his
eyes
and
the
very
libertine
gaze
with
which
he
often
beheld
her
gave
a
pang
to
glenmurray
which
was
but
too
soon
painfully
increased
sir
patrick
was
the
only
man
of
fashion
who
did
not
object
to
visit
at
mowbray
on
account
of
her
intimacy
with
glenmurray
but
he
had
his
own
private
reasons
for
going
thither
and
continued
to
visit
at
mrs
mowbray
though
glenmurray
was
generally
there
and
sometimes
he
and
the
latter
gentleman
were
the
whole
of
their
company
one
evening
they
and
two
ladies
were
drinking
tea
at
mrs
lodgings
when
mrs
mowbray
was
unusually
silent
and
adeline
unusually
talkative
adeline
scarcely
ever
spoke
in
her
mother
presence
from
deference
to
her
abilities
and
whatever
might
be
mrs
mowbray
defects
in
other
respects
her
conversational
talents
and
her
uncommon
command
of
words
were
indisputable
but
this
evening
as
i
before
observed
adeline
owing
to
her
mother
tender
abstractions
was
obliged
to
exert
herself
for
the
entertainment
of
the
guests
it
so
happened
also
that
something
was
said
by
one
of
the
party
which
led
to
the
subject
of
marriage
and
adeline
was
resolved
not
to
let
so
good
an
opportunity
pass
of
proving
to
glenmurray
how
sincerely
she
approved
his
doctrine
on
that
subject
immediately
with
an
unreserve
which
nothing
but
her
ignorance
of
the
world
and
the
strange
education
which
she
had
received
could
at
all
excuse
she
began
to
declaim
against
marriage
as
an
institution
at
once
absurd
unjust
and
immoral
and
to
declare
that
she
would
never
submit
to
so
contemptible
a
form
or
profane
the
sacred
ties
of
love
by
so
odious
and
unnecessary
a
ceremony
this
extraordinary
speech
though
worded
elegantly
and
delivered
gracefully
was
not
received
by
any
of
her
hearers
except
sir
patrick
with
any
thing
like
admiration
the
baronet
indeed
clapped
his
hands
and
cried
a
fine
spirited
girl
upon
my
word
in
a
manner
so
loud
and
so
offensive
to
the
feelings
of
adeline
that
like
the
orator
of
old
she
was
tempted
to
exclaim
foolish
thing
can
i
have
said
that
has
drawn
forth
this
applause
but
mrs
mowbray
though
she
could
not
help
admiring
the
eloquence
which
she
attributed
to
her
example
was
shocked
at
hearing
adeline
declare
that
her
practice
should
be
consonant
to
her
theory
while
glenmurray
though
adeline
had
only
expressed
his
sentiments
and
his
reason
approved
what
she
had
uttered
felt
his
delicacy
and
his
feelings
wounded
by
so
open
and
decided
an
avowal
of
her
opinions
and
intended
conduct
in
consequence
of
them
and
he
was
still
more
hurt
when
he
saw
how
much
it
delighted
sir
patrick
and
offended
the
rest
of
the
company
who
after
a
silence
the
result
of
surprise
and
disgust
suddenly
arose
and
coldly
wishing
mrs
mowbray
good
night
left
the
house
by
mrs
mowbray
the
cause
of
this
abrupt
departure
was
unsuspected
but
adeline
who
had
more
observation
was
convinced
that
she
was
the
cause
of
it
and
sighing
deeply
at
the
prejudices
of
the
world
she
sought
to
console
herself
by
looking
at
glenmurray
expecting
to
find
in
his
eyes
an
expression
of
delight
and
approbation
to
her
great
disappointment
however
his
countenance
was
sad
while
sir
patrick
on
the
contrary
had
an
expression
of
impudent
triumph
in
his
look
which
made
her
turn
blushing
from
his
ardent
gaze
and
indignantly
follow
her
mother
who
was
then
leaving
the
room
as
she
passed
him
sir
patrick
caught
her
hand
rapturously
to
his
lips
an
action
which
made
glenmurray
start
from
his
chair
and
exclaimed
you
are
the
only
honest
little
woman
i
ever
knew
i
always
was
sure
that
what
you
just
now
said
was
the
opinion
of
all
your
sex
though
they
were
so
confounded
coy
they
would
not
own
it
what
sir
asked
the
astonished
adeline
they
thought
marriage
a
cursed
bore
and
preferred
leading
the
life
of
honour
to
be
sure
life
of
honour
what
is
that
demanded
adeline
while
glenmurray
paced
the
room
in
agitation
life
my
dear
girl
which
you
mean
to
lead
love
and
liberty
with
the
man
of
your
heart
patrick
cried
glenmurray
impatiently
conversation
is
amusing
to
me
returned
the
baronet
as
i
never
could
hold
it
to
a
modest
woman
before
shall
you
now
sir
fiercely
interrupted
glenmurray
not
sir
vociferated
sir
patrick
gentlemen
be
less
violent
exclaimed
the
terrified
and
astonished
adeline
ca
think
what
could
offend
you
mr
glenmurray
in
sir
patrick
original
observation
the
life
of
honour
appears
to
me
a
very
excellent
name
for
the
pure
and
honourable
union
which
it
is
my
wish
to
form
and
i
told
you
so
triumphantly
interrupted
sir
patrick
i
never
was
better
pleased
in
life
sweet
creature
at
once
so
lovely
so
wise
and
so
liberal
cried
glenmurray
is
a
mistake
your
life
of
honour
and
miss
mowbray
are
as
different
as
possible
you
are
talking
of
what
you
are
grossly
ignorant
of
i
ignorant
look
you
mr
glenmurray
do
you
pretend
to
tell
me
i
know
not
what
the
life
of
honour
is
when
i
have
led
it
so
many
times
with
so
many
different
women
sir
replied
adeline
times
and
with
many
different
women
my
life
of
honour
can
be
led
with
one
only
my
dear
soul
i
only
led
it
with
one
at
a
time
sir
you
are
indeed
ignorant
of
my
meaning
she
rejoined
is
the
individuality
of
an
attachment
that
constitutes
its
purity
and
my
lovely
girl
which
has
purity
to
do
in
the
business
sir
patrick
meekly
returned
adeline
mowbray
angrily
interrupted
glenmurray
beg
i
conjure
you
to
drop
this
conversation
your
innocence
is
no
match
for
what
sir
furiously
demanded
sir
patrick
licentiousness
replied
glenmurray
i
wear
a
sword
cried
the
i
a
cane
said
glenmurray
calmly
to
defend
myself
or
chastise
insolence
glenmurray
sir
patrick
exclaimed
the
agitated
adeline
my
sake
for
pity
sake
desist
the
present
i
will
madam
faltered
out
sir
patrick
i
know
mr
glenmurray
address
and
he
shall
hear
from
me
from
you
why
you
do
not
mean
to
challenge
him
you
ca
suppose
mr
glenmurray
would
do
so
absurd
a
thing
as
fight
a
duel
sir
he
has
written
a
volume
to
prove
the
absurdity
of
the
no
no
you
threaten
his
life
in
vain
she
added
giving
her
hand
to
glenmurray
who
in
the
tenderness
of
the
action
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
forgot
the
displeasure
which
her
inadvertency
had
caused
and
pressing
her
hand
to
his
lips
secretly
renewed
his
vows
of
unalterable
attachment
well
madam
exclaimed
sir
patrick
in
a
tone
of
pique
so
as
mr
glenmurray
life
is
safe
you
care
not
what
becomes
of
mine
replied
adeline
safety
of
a
is
always
of
importance
in
my
eyes
you
care
for
me
as
a
only
retorted
sir
patrick
as
sir
patrick
mighty
fine
truly
you
dear
ungrateful
seizing
her
hand
which
he
relinquished
as
well
as
the
rest
of
his
speech
on
the
entrance
of
mrs
mowbray
soon
after
adeline
left
the
room
and
glenmurray
bowed
and
retired
while
sir
patrick
having
first
repeated
his
vows
of
admiration
to
the
mother
returned
home
to
muse
on
the
charms
of
the
daughter
and
the
necessity
of
challenging
the
moral
glenmurray
sir
patrick
was
a
man
of
courage
and
had
fought
several
duels
but
as
life
at
this
time
had
a
great
many
charms
for
him
he
resolved
to
defer
at
least
putting
himself
in
the
way
of
getting
rid
of
it
and
after
having
slept
late
in
the
morning
to
make
up
for
the
loss
of
sleep
in
the
night
occasioned
by
his
various
cogitations
he
rose
resolved
to
go
to
mrs
mowbray
and
if
he
had
an
opportunity
indulge
himself
in
some
practical
comments
on
the
singular
declaration
made
the
evening
before
by
her
lovely
daughter
glenmurray
meanwhile
had
passed
the
night
in
equal
watchfulness
and
greater
agitation
to
fight
a
duel
would
be
as
adeline
observed
contrary
to
his
principles
and
to
decline
one
irritated
as
he
was
against
sir
patrick
was
repugnant
to
his
feelings
to
no
purpose
did
he
peruse
and
nearly
the
whole
of
his
own
book
against
duelling
he
had
few
religious
restraints
to
make
him
resolve
on
declining
a
challenge
and
he
felt
moral
ones
of
little
avail
but
in
vain
did
he
sit
at
home
till
the
morning
was
far
advanced
expecting
a
messenger
from
sir
patrick
no
messenger
came
he
therefore
left
word
with
his
servant
that
if
wanted
he
might
be
found
at
mrs
mowbray
and
went
thither
in
hopes
of
enjoying
an
conversation
with
adeline
resolving
to
hint
to
her
as
delicately
as
he
could
that
the
opinions
which
she
had
expressed
were
better
confined
in
the
present
dark
state
of
the
public
mind
to
a
select
and
discriminating
circle
chapter
vi
sir
patrick
had
reached
mrs
mowbray
some
time
before
him
and
had
to
his
great
satisfaction
found
adeline
alone
nor
did
it
escape
his
penetration
that
her
cheeks
glowed
and
her
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
at
his
approach
but
he
would
not
have
rejoiced
in
this
circumstance
had
he
known
that
adeline
was
pleased
to
see
him
merely
because
she
considered
his
appearance
as
a
proof
of
glenmurray
safety
for
in
spite
of
his
having
written
against
duelling
and
of
her
confidence
in
his
firmness
and
consistency
she
was
not
quite
convinced
that
the
reasoning
philosopher
would
triumph
over
the
feeling
man
are
welcome
sir
patrick
cried
adeline
as
he
entered
with
a
most
winning
smile
am
very
glad
to
see
you
pray
sit
down
the
baronet
who
audacious
as
his
hopes
and
intentions
were
had
not
expected
so
kind
a
reception
was
quite
thrown
off
his
guard
by
it
and
catching
her
suddenly
in
his
arms
endeavoured
to
obtain
a
still
kinder
welcome
adeline
as
suddenly
disengaged
herself
from
him
and
with
the
dignity
of
offended
modesty
desired
him
to
quit
the
room
as
after
such
an
insolent
attempt
she
could
not
think
herself
justified
in
suffering
him
to
remain
with
her
but
her
anger
was
soon
changed
into
pity
when
she
saw
sir
patrick
lay
down
his
hat
seat
himself
and
burst
into
a
long
deliberate
laugh
is
certainly
mad
she
exclaimed
and
leaning
against
the
she
began
to
contemplate
him
with
a
degree
of
fearful
interest
my
soul
now
cried
the
baronet
when
his
laugh
was
over
do
not
suppose
my
dear
creature
that
you
and
i
do
not
understand
one
another
telling
a
young
fellow
to
leave
the
house
on
such
occasions
means
in
the
pretty
no
meaning
of
your
sex
stay
and
offend
again
to
be
sure
is
certainly
mad
said
adeline
more
confirmed
than
before
in
her
idea
of
his
insanity
and
immediately
endeavoured
to
reach
the
door
but
in
so
doing
she
approached
sir
patrick
who
rather
roughly
seizing
her
trembling
hand
desired
her
to
sit
down
and
hear
what
he
had
to
say
to
her
adeline
thinking
it
not
right
to
irritate
him
instantly
obeyed
then
to
open
my
mind
to
you
said
the
baronet
drawing
his
chair
close
to
hers
the
very
first
moment
i
saw
you
i
felt
that
we
were
made
for
one
another
though
being
bothered
by
my
debts
i
made
up
to
the
old
duchess
and
she
nibbled
the
bait
directly
deeming
my
clean
inches
six
feet
one
without
shoes
well
worth
her
dirty
acres
dreadfully
incoherent
he
is
thought
adeline
not
suspecting
for
a
moment
that
by
the
old
duchess
he
meant
her
still
blooming
mother
my
lovely
dear
continued
sir
patrick
most
ardently
pressing
her
hand
much
have
your
sweet
person
and
your
frank
and
liberal
way
of
thinking
charmed
me
that
i
here
freely
offer
myself
to
you
and
we
will
begin
the
life
of
honour
together
as
soon
as
you
please
still
adeline
who
was
unconscious
how
much
her
avowed
opinions
had
exposed
her
to
insult
continued
to
believe
sir
patrick
insane
a
belief
which
the
wildness
of
his
eyes
confirmed
really
know
not
you
surprise
me
sir
patrick
i
you
my
dear
soul
how
could
you
expect
anything
else
from
a
man
of
my
spirit
after
your
honest
declaration
last
night
all
i
feared
was
that
glenmurray
should
get
the
start
of
me
adeline
though
alarmed
bewildered
and
confounded
had
still
recollection
enough
to
know
that
whether
sane
or
insane
the
words
and
looks
of
sir
patrick
were
full
of
increasing
insult
believe
i
think
i
had
better
retire
faltered
out
adeline
no
indeed
exclaimed
the
baronet
rudely
seizing
her
this
outrage
restored
adeline
to
her
usual
spirit
and
and
bestowing
on
him
the
epithet
of
ruffian
she
had
almost
freed
herself
from
his
grasp
when
a
quick
step
was
heard
on
the
stairs
and
the
door
was
thrown
open
by
glenmurray
in
a
moment
adeline
bursting
into
tears
threw
herself
into
his
arms
as
if
in
search
of
protection
glenmurray
required
no
explanation
of
the
scene
before
him
the
appearance
of
the
actors
in
it
was
explanation
sufficient
and
while
with
one
arm
he
fondly
held
adeline
to
his
bosom
he
raised
the
other
in
a
threatening
attitude
against
sir
patrick
exclaiming
as
he
did
it
unmanly
villain
echoed
sir
patrick
it
is
very
well
very
well
for
the
present
good
morning
to
you
sir
so
saying
he
hastily
withdrew
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
glenmurray
for
the
first
time
declared
to
adeline
the
ardent
passion
with
which
she
had
inspired
him
and
she
with
equal
frankness
confessed
that
her
heart
was
irrevocably
his
from
this
interesting
adeline
was
summoned
to
attend
a
person
on
business
to
her
mother
and
during
her
absence
glenmurray
received
a
challenge
from
the
angry
baronet
appointing
him
to
meet
him
that
afternoon
at
five
about
two
miles
from
bath
to
this
note
for
fear
of
alarming
the
suspicions
of
adeline
glenmurray
returned
only
a
verbal
message
saying
he
would
answer
it
in
two
hours
but
as
soon
as
she
returned
he
pleaded
indispensable
business
and
before
she
could
mention
any
fears
respecting
the
consequences
of
what
had
passed
between
him
and
sir
patrick
he
had
left
the
room
having
to
prevent
any
alarm
requested
leave
to
wait
on
her
early
the
next
day
as
soon
as
glenmurray
reached
his
lodgings
he
again
revolved
in
his
mind
the
propriety
of
accepting
the
challenge
can
i
expect
to
influence
others
by
my
theories
to
act
right
if
my
practice
sets
them
a
bad
example
but
then
again
he
exclaimed
can
i
expect
to
have
any
thing
i
say
attended
to
when
by
refusing
to
fight
i
put
it
in
the
power
of
my
enemies
to
assert
i
am
a
poltroon
and
worthy
only
of
neglect
and
contempt
no
no
i
must
fight
even
adeline
herself
especially
as
it
is
on
her
account
will
despise
me
if
i
do
not
and
then
without
giving
himself
any
more
time
to
deliberate
he
sent
an
answer
to
sir
patrick
promising
to
meet
him
at
the
time
appointed
but
after
he
had
sent
it
he
found
himself
a
prey
to
so
much
and
after
he
had
forfeited
his
claims
to
consistency
of
conduct
he
felt
himself
so
strongly
aware
of
the
value
of
it
that
had
not
the
time
of
the
meeting
been
near
at
hand
he
would
certainly
have
deliberated
upon
some
means
of
retracting
his
consent
to
it
being
resolved
to
do
as
little
mischief
as
he
could
he
determined
on
having
no
second
in
the
business
and
accordingly
repaired
to
the
field
accompanied
only
by
a
trusty
servant
who
had
orders
to
wait
his
pleasure
at
a
distance
contrary
to
glenmurray
expectations
sir
patrick
also
came
unattended
by
a
second
while
his
servant
who
was
with
him
was
like
the
other
desired
to
remain
in
the
back
ground
wish
mr
glenmurray
to
do
every
thing
honourable
said
the
baronet
after
they
had
exchanged
salutations
sir
as
i
concluded
you
would
find
it
difficult
to
get
a
second
i
am
come
without
one
and
i
that
i
aye
men
of
your
principle
can
have
but
few
friends
men
of
your
practice
ought
to
have
none
sir
patrick
retorted
glenmurray
as
i
do
think
it
worth
while
to
explain
to
you
my
reasons
for
not
having
a
second
as
i
fear
that
you
are
incapable
of
understanding
them
i
must
desire
you
to
take
your
ground
all
my
heart
replied
his
antagonist
and
then
taking
aim
they
agreed
to
fire
at
the
same
moment
they
did
so
and
the
servants
hearing
the
report
of
the
pistols
ran
to
the
scene
of
action
and
saw
sir
patrick
bleeding
in
the
and
glenmurray
also
wounded
leaning
against
a
tree
is
cursed
unlucky
said
sir
patrick
coolly
have
disabled
my
right
arm
i
ca
go
on
with
this
business
at
present
but
when
i
am
well
again
command
me
your
wound
i
believe
is
as
slight
as
mine
but
as
i
can
walk
and
you
can
not
and
as
i
have
a
chaise
and
you
not
you
shall
use
it
to
convey
you
and
your
servant
home
and
i
and
mine
will
go
on
foot
to
this
obliging
offer
glenmurray
was
incapable
of
giving
denial
for
he
became
insensible
from
loss
of
blood
and
with
the
assistance
of
his
antagonist
was
carried
to
the
chaise
and
supported
by
his
terrified
servant
conveyed
back
to
bath
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
an
event
of
this
nature
should
be
long
unknown
it
was
soon
told
all
over
the
city
that
sir
patrick
and
mr
glenmurray
had
fought
a
duel
and
that
the
latter
was
dangerously
wounded
the
quarrel
having
originated
in
mr
glenmurray
scoffing
at
religion
king
and
constitution
before
the
pious
and
loyal
baronet
this
story
soon
reached
the
ears
of
mrs
mowbray
who
in
an
agony
of
tender
sorrow
and
in
defiance
of
all
decorum
went
in
person
to
call
on
her
admired
sir
patrick
and
adeline
who
heard
of
the
affair
soon
after
as
regardless
of
appearances
as
her
mother
and
more
alarmed
went
in
person
to
inquire
concerning
her
wounded
glenmurray
by
the
time
that
she
had
arrived
at
his
lodgings
not
only
his
own
surgeon
but
sir
patrick
had
seen
him
as
his
antagonist
thought
it
necessary
to
ascertain
the
true
state
of
his
wound
that
he
might
know
whether
he
ought
to
stay
or
fly
his
country
the
account
of
both
the
surgeons
was
however
so
favourable
and
glenmurray
in
all
respects
so
well
that
sir
patrick
alarms
were
soon
quite
at
an
end
and
the
wounded
man
was
lying
on
a
sofa
lost
in
no
very
pleasant
reflections
when
adeline
knocked
at
his
door
glenmurray
at
that
very
moment
was
saying
to
himself
so
much
for
principle
and
consistency
now
my
next
step
must
be
to
marry
and
then
i
shall
have
made
myself
a
complete
fool
and
the
worst
of
all
fools
a
man
presuming
to
instruct
others
by
his
precepts
when
he
finds
them
incapable
of
influencing
even
his
own
actions
at
this
moment
his
servant
came
up
with
miss
mowbray
compliments
and
if
he
was
well
enough
to
see
her
she
would
come
up
and
speak
to
him
in
an
instant
all
his
were
forgotten
and
when
adeline
hung
weeping
and
silent
on
his
shoulder
he
could
not
but
rejoice
in
an
affair
which
had
procured
him
a
moment
of
such
heartfelt
delight
at
first
adeline
expressed
nothing
but
terror
at
the
consequences
of
his
wound
and
pity
for
his
sufferings
but
when
she
found
that
he
was
in
no
danger
and
in
very
little
pain
the
tender
mistress
yielded
to
the
severe
monitress
and
she
began
to
upbraid
glenmurray
for
having
acted
not
only
in
defiance
of
her
wishes
and
principles
but
of
his
own
of
principles
laid
down
by
him
to
the
world
in
the
strongest
point
of
view
and
in
a
manner
convincing
to
every
mind
adeline
consider
the
provocation
cried
glenmurray
gross
insult
offered
to
the
woman
i
love
who
ever
fought
a
duel
without
provocation
glenmurray
if
provocation
be
a
justification
your
book
was
unnecessary
and
did
not
you
offer
an
insult
to
the
understanding
of
the
woman
you
love
in
supposing
that
she
could
be
obliged
to
you
for
playing
the
fool
on
her
account
i
should
have
been
called
a
coward
had
i
declined
the
challenge
and
though
i
can
bear
the
world
hatred
i
could
not
its
contempt
i
could
not
endure
the
loss
of
what
the
world
calls
honour
it
possible
rejoined
adeline
i
hear
the
philosophical
glenmurray
talking
thus
in
the
silly
jargon
of
a
man
of
the
world
i
am
a
man
not
a
philosopher
adeline
least
be
a
sensible
one
consistent
i
dare
not
now
call
you
but
have
you
forgotten
the
distinction
which
in
your
volume
on
the
subject
of
duels
you
so
strongly
lay
down
between
real
and
apparent
honour
in
which
of
the
two
classes
do
you
put
the
honour
of
which
in
this
instance
you
were
so
tenacious
what
is
there
in
common
between
the
glory
of
risking
the
life
of
a
and
testimony
of
an
approving
conscience
excellent
observation
that
of
yours
indeed
my
sweet
monitress
said
glenmurray
observation
of
mine
it
is
your
own
replied
adeline
see
i
have
the
book
in
my
muff
and
i
will
punish
you
for
the
badness
of
your
practice
by
giving
you
a
dose
of
your
theory
girl
cried
glenmurray
am
not
ordered
a
sleeping
draught
adeline
was
however
resolved
and
opening
the
book
she
read
argument
after
argument
with
unyielding
perseverance
till
glenmurray
who
like
the
eagle
in
the
song
saw
on
the
dart
that
wounded
him
his
own
feathers
cried
tell
me
dear
adeline
said
glenmurray
a
little
piqued
at
her
too
just
reproofs
who
are
so
severe
on
my
want
of
consistency
are
you
yourself
capable
of
acting
up
in
every
respect
to
your
precepts
your
weakness
replied
adeline
smiling
becomes
me
to
doubt
my
own
strength
but
i
assure
you
that
i
make
it
a
scruple
of
conscience
to
show
by
my
conduct
my
confidence
in
the
truth
of
my
opinions
in
defiance
of
the
world
opinion
that
opinion
which
i
you
see
had
not
resolution
to
brave
you
will
be
mine
not
according
to
the
ties
of
marriage
but
with
no
other
ties
or
sanction
than
those
of
love
and
reason
will
said
adeline
may
he
whom
i
worship
raising
her
fine
eyes
and
white
arms
to
heaven
me
when
i
desert
you
who
that
had
seen
her
countenance
and
gesture
at
that
moment
could
have
imagined
she
was
calling
on
heaven
to
witness
an
engagement
to
lead
a
life
of
infamy
rather
would
they
have
thought
her
a
sublime
enthusiast
breathing
forth
the
worship
of
a
grateful
soul
it
may
be
supposed
that
glenmurray
heart
beat
with
exultation
at
this
confession
from
adeline
and
that
he
forgot
in
the
promised
indulgence
of
his
passion
those
bounds
which
strict
decorum
required
but
glenmurray
did
her
justice
he
beheld
her
as
she
was
all
purity
of
feeling
and
all
delicacy
and
if
possible
the
slight
favours
by
which
true
love
is
long
contented
to
be
fed
though
granted
by
adeline
with
more
conscious
emotion
were
received
by
him
with
more
devoted
respect
besides
he
again
felt
that
mixture
of
pain
with
pleasure
on
this
assurance
of
her
love
which
he
had
experienced
before
for
he
knew
though
adeline
did
not
the
extent
of
the
degradation
into
which
the
step
which
her
conscience
approved
would
necessarily
precipitate
her
and
experience
alone
could
convince
him
that
her
sensibility
to
shame
when
she
was
for
the
first
time
exposed
to
it
would
not
overcome
her
supposed
fortitude
and
boasted
contempt
of
the
world
opinion
and
change
all
the
roses
of
love
into
the
thorns
of
regret
and
remorse
and
could
he
who
doted
on
her
he
too
who
admired
her
as
much
for
her
consummate
purity
as
for
any
other
of
her
qualities
could
he
bear
to
behold
this
fair
creature
whose
open
eye
beamed
with
the
consciousness
of
virtue
casting
her
timid
glances
to
the
earth
and
shrinking
with
horror
from
the
conviction
of
having
in
the
world
eye
forfeited
all
pretensions
to
that
virtue
which
alone
was
the
end
of
her
actions
would
the
approbation
of
her
own
mind
be
sufficient
to
support
her
under
such
a
trial
though
she
had
with
such
sweet
earnestness
talked
to
him
of
its
efficacy
these
reflections
had
for
some
time
past
been
continually
occurring
to
him
and
now
they
came
across
his
mind
blighting
the
triumphs
of
successful
passion
nay
but
from
the
dread
of
incurring
yet
more
ridicule
on
account
of
the
opposition
of
his
practice
to
his
theory
and
perhaps
the
indignant
contempt
of
adeline
he
could
have
thrown
himself
at
her
feet
conjuring
her
to
submit
to
the
degradation
of
being
a
wife
but
unknown
to
glenmurray
perhaps
another
reason
prompted
him
to
desire
this
concession
from
adeline
we
are
never
more
likely
to
be
in
reality
the
slaves
of
selfishness
than
when
we
fancy
ourselves
acting
with
most
heroic
egotism
loves
a
becoming
dress
and
is
always
on
the
watch
to
hide
her
ugliness
by
the
robe
of
benevolence
glenmurray
thought
that
he
was
willing
to
marry
adeline
merely
for
sake
but
i
suspect
it
was
chiefly
for
the
true
and
delicate
lover
is
always
a
monopolizer
always
desirous
of
calling
the
woman
of
his
affections
his
own
it
is
not
only
because
he
considers
marriage
as
a
holy
institution
that
the
lover
leads
his
mistress
to
the
altar
but
because
it
gives
him
a
right
to
appropriate
the
fair
treasure
to
himself
because
it
sanctions
and
perpetuates
the
dearest
of
all
monopolies
and
erects
a
sacred
barrier
to
guard
his
rights
around
which
all
that
is
respectable
in
society
all
that
is
most
powerful
and
effectual
in
its
organization
is
proud
and
eager
to
rally
but
while
glenmurray
in
spite
of
his
happiness
was
sensible
to
an
alloy
of
it
and
adeline
was
tenderly
imputing
to
the
pain
of
his
wound
the
occasionally
mournful
expression
of
his
countenance
adeline
took
occasion
to
declare
that
she
would
live
with
glenmurray
only
on
condition
that
such
a
step
met
with
her
mother
approbation
are
my
hopes
for
ever
at
an
end
said
glenmurray
or
and
spite
of
himself
his
eyes
sparkled
as
he
spoke
we
must
submit
to
the
absurd
ceremony
of
marriage
replied
the
astonished
adeline
you
think
so
meanly
of
my
mother
as
to
suppose
her
practice
so
totally
opposite
to
her
principles
that
she
would
require
her
daughter
to
submit
to
a
ceremony
which
she
herself
regards
with
contempt
impossible
i
am
sure
when
i
solicit
her
consent
to
my
being
yours
she
will
be
pleased
to
find
that
her
sentiments
and
observations
have
not
been
thrown
away
on
me
glenmurray
thought
otherwise
however
he
bowed
and
was
silent
and
adeline
declared
that
to
put
an
end
to
all
doubt
on
the
subject
she
would
instantly
go
in
search
of
mrs
mowbray
and
propose
the
question
to
her
and
glenmurray
feeling
himself
more
weak
and
indisposed
than
he
chose
to
own
to
her
allowed
her
though
reluctantly
to
depart
chapter
vii
mrs
mowbray
was
but
just
returned
from
her
charitable
visit
when
adeline
entered
the
room
pray
miss
mowbray
where
have
you
been
she
exclaimed
seeing
adeline
with
her
hat
and
cloak
on
have
been
visiting
poor
mr
glenmurray
she
replied
cried
mrs
mowbray
without
my
leave
and
pray
who
went
with
you
what
visit
a
man
alone
at
his
lodgings
after
the
education
which
you
have
received
madam
replied
adeline
meekly
education
never
taught
me
that
such
conduct
was
improper
nor
as
you
did
the
same
this
afternoon
could
i
have
dared
to
think
it
so
are
mistaken
miss
mowbray
replied
her
mother
did
not
do
the
same
for
the
terms
which
i
am
upon
with
sir
patrick
made
my
visiting
him
no
impropriety
at
all
you
think
i
have
acted
wrong
replied
adeline
timidly
doubt
i
have
done
so
though
you
were
quite
right
in
visiting
sir
patrick
as
the
respectability
of
your
age
and
character
and
sir
patrick
youth
warranted
the
propriety
of
the
visit
but
surely
the
terms
which
i
am
upon
with
mr
glenmurray
terms
which
you
are
upon
with
mr
glenmurray
and
my
age
and
character
what
can
you
mean
angrily
exclaimed
mrs
mowbray
hope
my
dear
mother
said
adeline
tenderly
you
had
long
ere
this
guessed
the
attachment
which
subsists
between
mr
glenmurray
and
me
an
attachment
cherished
by
your
high
opinion
of
him
and
his
writings
but
which
respect
has
till
now
made
me
hesitate
to
mention
to
you
to
heaven
replied
mrs
mowbray
respect
had
made
you
for
ever
silent
on
the
subject
do
you
suppose
that
i
would
marry
my
daughter
to
a
man
of
small
fortune
but
more
especially
to
one
who
as
sir
patrick
informs
me
is
shunned
for
his
principles
and
profligacy
by
all
the
world
what
sir
patrick
says
of
mr
glenmurray
i
pay
no
attention
answered
adeline
are
you
my
dear
mother
capable
i
am
sure
of
being
influenced
by
the
prejudices
of
the
but
you
are
quite
mistaken
in
supposing
me
so
lost
to
consistency
and
so
regardless
of
your
liberal
opinions
and
the
books
which
we
have
studied
as
to
think
of
mr
glenmurray
me
patience
cried
mrs
mowbray
to
be
sure
you
do
not
think
of
living
with
him
being
married
madam
that
you
may
have
the
pleasure
of
beholding
one
union
founded
on
rational
grounds
and
cemented
by
rational
ties
cried
mrs
mowbray
turning
pale
i
have
pleasure
in
seeing
my
daughter
a
kept
mistress
you
are
mad
quite
approve
such
unhallowed
connexions
dearest
mother
replied
adeline
agitation
terrifies
me
but
indeed
what
i
say
is
strictly
true
and
see
here
in
mr
book
the
very
passage
which
i
so
often
have
heard
you
admire
as
she
said
this
adeline
pointed
to
the
passage
but
in
an
instant
mrs
mowbray
seized
the
book
and
threw
it
on
the
fire
before
adeline
had
recovered
her
consternation
mrs
mowbray
fell
into
a
violent
hysteric
and
long
was
it
before
she
was
restored
to
composure
when
she
recovered
she
was
so
exhausted
that
adeline
dared
not
renew
the
conversation
but
leaving
her
to
rest
she
made
up
a
bed
on
the
floor
in
her
mother
room
and
passed
a
night
of
wretchedness
and
watchfulness
the
first
of
the
kind
which
she
had
ever
would
it
had
been
the
last
in
the
morning
mrs
mowbray
awoke
refreshed
and
calm
and
affected
at
seeing
the
pale
cheek
and
sunk
eye
of
adeline
indicative
of
a
sleepless
and
unhappy
night
she
held
out
her
hand
to
her
with
a
look
of
kindness
adeline
pressed
it
to
her
lips
as
she
knelt
by
the
and
moistened
it
with
tears
of
regret
for
the
past
and
alarm
for
the
future
my
dear
child
said
mrs
mowbray
in
a
faint
voice
hope
you
will
no
longer
think
of
putting
a
design
in
execution
so
fraught
with
mischief
to
you
and
horror
to
me
little
did
i
think
that
you
were
so
romantic
as
to
see
no
difference
between
amusing
one
imagination
with
new
theories
and
new
systems
and
acting
upon
them
in
defiance
of
common
custom
and
the
received
usages
of
society
i
admire
the
convenient
trousers
and
graceful
dress
of
the
turkish
women
but
i
would
not
wear
them
myself
lest
it
should
expose
me
to
derision
there
no
difference
thought
adeline
the
importance
of
a
dress
and
an
opinion
is
the
one
to
be
taken
up
and
laid
down
again
with
the
same
indifference
as
the
other
but
she
continued
silent
and
mrs
mowbray
went
on
poetical
philosophy
which
i
have
so
much
delighted
to
study
has
served
me
to
ornament
my
conversation
and
make
persons
less
enlightened
than
myself
wonder
at
the
superior
boldness
of
my
fancy
and
the
acuteness
of
my
reasoning
powers
but
i
should
as
soon
have
thought
of
making
this
little
gold
chain
round
my
neck
fasten
the
as
act
upon
the
precepts
laid
down
in
those
delightful
books
no
though
i
think
all
they
say
is
true
i
believe
the
purity
they
inculcate
too
much
for
this
world
adeline
listened
in
silent
astonishment
and
consternation
conscience
and
the
conviction
of
what
is
right
she
then
for
the
first
time
learned
were
not
to
be
the
rule
of
action
and
though
filial
tenderness
made
her
resolve
never
to
be
the
mistress
of
glenmurray
she
also
resolved
never
to
be
his
wife
or
that
of
any
other
man
while
in
spite
of
herself
the
great
respect
with
which
she
had
hitherto
regarded
her
conduct
and
opinions
began
to
diminish
to
heaven
my
dear
mother
said
adeline
when
mrs
mowbray
had
done
speaking
you
had
said
all
this
to
me
ere
my
mind
had
been
indelibly
impressed
with
the
truth
of
these
forbidden
doctrines
for
now
my
conscience
tells
me
that
i
ought
to
act
up
to
them
exclaimed
mrs
mowbray
starting
up
in
her
bed
and
in
a
voice
shrill
with
emotion
you
then
resolved
to
disobey
me
and
dishonour
yourself
never
never
replied
adeline
alarmed
at
her
mother
violence
and
fearful
of
a
relapse
but
the
kind
affectionate
parent
that
you
have
ever
been
to
me
and
though
i
will
never
marry
out
of
regard
to
my
own
principles
i
will
also
never
contract
any
other
union
out
of
respect
to
your
wishes
but
will
lead
with
you
a
quiet
if
not
a
life
for
never
never
can
i
forget
glenmurray
speaks
the
excellent
child
i
always
thought
you
to
be
replied
mrs
mowbray
i
shall
leave
it
to
time
and
good
counsels
to
convince
you
that
the
opinions
of
a
girl
of
eighteen
as
they
are
not
founded
on
long
experience
may
possibly
be
erroneous
mrs
mowbray
never
made
a
truer
observation
but
adeline
was
not
in
a
frame
of
mind
to
assent
to
it
continued
mrs
mowbray
i
ever
been
disposed
to
accept
of
mr
glenmurray
as
a
it
is
very
unlikely
that
i
should
be
so
now
as
the
duel
took
place
not
only
i
find
from
the
treasonable
opinions
which
he
put
forth
but
from
some
disrespectful
language
which
he
held
concerning
me
could
dare
to
invent
so
infamous
a
calumny
exclaimed
adeline
authority
is
unquestionable
miss
mowbray
i
speak
from
sir
patrick
himself
he
adds
falsehood
to
his
other
villanies
returned
adeline
almost
inarticulate
with
rage
what
could
be
expected
from
a
man
who
could
dare
to
insult
a
young
woman
under
the
roof
of
her
mother
with
his
licentious
addresses
mean
you
cried
mrs
mowbray
turning
pale
mean
that
sir
patrick
yesterday
morning
insulted
me
by
the
grossest
familiarities
and
dear
child
replied
mrs
mowbray
laughing
is
only
the
usual
freedom
of
his
manner
a
manner
which
your
ignorance
of
the
world
led
you
to
mistake
he
did
not
mean
to
insult
you
believe
me
i
am
sure
that
spite
of
his
ardent
passion
for
me
he
never
even
when
alone
with
me
hazarded
any
improper
liberty
ardent
passion
which
he
feels
for
you
madam
exclaimed
adeline
turning
pale
in
her
turn
miss
mowbray
what
i
suppose
you
think
me
too
old
to
inspire
one
but
i
assure
you
there
are
people
who
think
the
mother
handsomer
than
the
daughter
doubt
dear
mother
every
one
ought
to
think
so
and
would
to
heaven
sir
patrick
were
one
of
those
but
he
unfortunately
of
that
opinion
interrupted
mrs
mowbray
angrily
to
convince
you
so
tenderly
does
he
love
me
and
so
fondly
do
i
return
his
passion
that
in
a
few
days
i
shall
become
his
wife
adeline
on
hearing
this
terrible
information
fell
insensible
on
the
ground
when
she
recovered
she
saw
mrs
mowbray
anxiously
watching
by
her
but
not
with
that
look
of
alarm
and
tenderness
with
which
she
had
attended
her
during
her
long
illness
that
look
which
was
always
present
to
her
graceful
and
affectionate
remembrance
no
mrs
mowbray
eye
was
cast
down
with
a
and
expression
when
it
met
that
of
adeline
the
emotion
of
anguish
which
her
fainting
had
evinced
was
a
reproach
to
the
proud
heart
of
mrs
mowbray
and
adeline
felt
that
it
was
so
but
when
she
recollected
that
her
mother
was
going
to
marry
a
man
who
had
so
lately
declared
a
criminal
passion
for
herself
she
was
very
near
relapsing
into
insensibility
she
however
struggled
with
her
feelings
in
order
to
gain
resolution
to
disclose
to
mrs
mowbray
all
that
had
passed
between
her
and
sir
patrick
but
as
soon
as
she
offered
to
renew
the
conversation
mrs
mowbray
sternly
commanded
her
to
be
silent
and
insisting
on
her
going
to
bed
she
left
her
to
her
own
reflections
till
wearied
and
exhausted
she
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
nor
as
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
she
awoke
did
she
rise
again
till
the
next
morning
mrs
mowbray
entered
her
room
as
she
was
dressing
and
inquired
how
she
did
with
some
kindness
shall
be
better
dear
mother
if
you
will
but
hear
what
i
have
to
say
concerning
sir
patrick
replied
adeline
bursting
into
tears
can
say
nothing
that
will
shake
my
opinion
of
him
miss
mowbray
replied
her
mother
coldly
i
advise
you
to
reconcile
yourself
to
a
circumstance
which
it
is
not
in
your
power
to
prevent
so
saying
she
left
the
room
and
adeline
convinced
that
all
she
could
say
would
be
vain
endeavoured
to
console
herself
by
thinking
that
as
soon
as
sir
patrick
became
the
husband
of
her
mother
his
wicked
designs
on
her
would
undoubtedly
cease
and
that
therefore
in
one
respect
that
union
would
be
beneficial
to
her
sir
patrick
meanwhile
was
no
less
sanguine
in
his
expectations
from
his
marriage
unlike
the
innocent
adeline
he
did
not
consider
his
union
with
the
mother
as
a
necessary
check
to
his
attempts
on
the
daughter
but
emboldened
by
what
to
him
appeared
the
libertine
sentiments
of
adeline
and
relying
on
the
opportunities
of
being
with
her
which
he
must
infallibly
enjoy
under
the
same
roof
in
the
country
he
looked
on
her
as
his
certain
prey
though
he
believed
glenmurray
to
be
at
that
moment
preferred
to
himself
he
thought
it
impossible
that
the
superior
beauty
of
his
person
should
not
in
the
end
have
its
due
weight
as
a
passion
founded
in
esteem
and
the
admiration
of
intellectual
beauty
could
not
in
his
opinion
subsist
besides
adeline
appeared
in
his
eyes
not
a
deceived
enthusiast
but
a
susceptible
and
forward
girl
endeavouring
to
hide
her
frailty
under
fine
sentiments
and
theories
nor
was
sir
patrick
inference
an
unnatural
one
every
man
of
the
world
would
have
thought
the
same
and
on
very
plausible
grounds
chapter
viii
as
sir
patrick
was
not
as
lovers
to
the
moment
sworn
mrs
mowbray
resolved
to
sit
down
and
write
immediately
to
glenmurray
flattering
herself
at
the
same
time
that
the
letter
which
was
designed
to
confound
glenmurray
would
delight
the
tender
baronet
for
mrs
mowbray
piqued
herself
on
her
talents
for
and
was
not
a
little
pleased
with
an
opportunity
of
displaying
them
to
a
celebrated
author
but
never
before
did
she
find
writing
a
letter
so
difficult
a
task
her
eager
wish
of
excelling
deprived
her
of
the
means
and
she
who
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
or
relation
would
have
written
in
a
style
at
once
clear
and
elegant
after
two
hours
effort
produced
the
following
specimen
of
the
obscure
the
pedantic
and
light
which
cheers
and
attracts
if
we
follow
its
guidance
often
leads
us
into
bogs
and
quagmires
verbum
sapienti
your
writings
are
the
lights
and
the
practice
to
which
you
advise
my
deluded
daughter
is
the
bog
and
quagmire
i
agree
with
you
in
all
you
have
said
against
marriage
i
agree
with
the
savage
nations
in
the
total
uselessness
of
clothing
still
i
condescend
to
wear
clothes
though
neither
becoming
nor
useful
because
i
respect
public
opinion
and
i
submit
to
the
institution
of
marriage
for
reasons
equally
cogent
such
being
my
sentiments
sir
i
must
desire
you
never
to
see
my
daughter
more
nor
could
you
expect
to
be
received
with
open
arms
by
me
whom
the
shafts
of
your
ridicule
have
pierced
though
warded
off
by
the
shield
of
love
and
gallantry
but
for
this
i
thank
you
now
shall
i
possess
owing
to
your
baseness
at
once
a
declared
lover
and
a
tried
avenger
and
the
chains
of
hymen
will
be
rendered
more
charming
by
gratitude
having
blown
the
flame
while
love
forged
the
fetters
with
your
writings
i
continue
to
amuse
my
lovely
is
the
flower
of
the
nightshade
though
its
berry
be
poison
still
shall
i
admire
and
wonder
at
you
as
an
author
though
i
avoid
and
detest
you
as
a
man
mowbray
this
letter
was
just
finished
when
sir
patrick
arrived
and
to
him
it
was
immediately
shown
what
have
we
here
cried
he
laughing
violently
as
he
perused
it
you
talk
of
being
pierced
by
shafts
which
were
warded
off
now
had
i
said
that
it
would
have
been
called
a
bull
as
to
the
concluding
paragraph
that
i
flatter
myself
said
mrs
mowbray
tear
him
with
remorse
must
first
understand
it
cried
sir
patrick
can
but
just
comprehend
it
and
am
sure
it
will
be
all
botheration
to
him
am
sorry
to
find
such
is
your
opinion
replied
mrs
mowbray
i
think
that
sentence
the
best
written
of
any
did
not
say
it
was
not
fine
writing
replied
the
baronet
only
said
it
was
not
to
be
but
with
your
leave
you
shall
send
the
letter
and
we
drop
the
subject
so
said
so
done
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
sir
patrick
who
felt
that
it
was
for
his
interest
to
suffer
the
part
of
mrs
mowbray
letter
which
alluded
to
glenmurray
supposed
calumnies
against
her
to
remain
obscurely
worded
as
he
well
knew
that
what
he
had
asserted
on
this
subject
was
wholly
void
of
foundation
glenmurray
did
not
receive
it
with
equal
satisfaction
he
was
indignant
at
the
charge
of
having
advised
adeline
to
become
his
mistress
rather
than
his
wife
and
as
so
much
of
the
concluding
passage
as
he
could
understand
seemed
to
imply
that
he
had
calumniated
her
mother
to
remain
silent
a
moment
would
have
been
to
confess
himself
guilty
he
therefore
answered
mrs
mowbray
letter
immediately
the
answer
was
as
follows
clear
myself
from
the
charge
of
having
advised
miss
mowbray
to
a
step
contrary
to
the
common
customs
however
erroneous
of
society
at
this
period
i
appeal
to
the
testimony
of
miss
mowbray
herself
and
i
here
repeat
to
you
the
assurance
which
i
made
to
her
that
i
am
willing
to
marry
her
when
and
where
she
chooses
i
love
my
system
and
my
opinions
but
the
respectability
of
the
woman
of
my
affections
allow
me
therefore
to
make
you
a
little
acquainted
with
my
situation
in
life
you
it
is
well
known
madam
that
wealth
honours
and
titles
have
no
value
in
my
eyes
and
that
i
reverence
talents
and
virtues
though
they
wear
the
garb
of
poverty
and
are
born
in
the
most
obscure
stations
but
you
or
rather
those
who
are
so
fortunate
as
to
influence
your
determinations
may
consider
my
sentiments
on
this
subject
as
romantic
and
absurd
it
is
necessary
therefore
that
i
should
tell
you
as
an
excuse
in
their
eyes
for
presuming
to
address
your
daughter
that
by
the
accident
of
birth
i
am
descended
from
an
ancient
family
and
nearly
allied
to
a
noble
one
and
that
my
paternal
inheritance
though
not
large
enough
for
splendour
and
luxury
is
sufficient
for
all
the
purposes
of
comfort
and
genteel
affluence
i
would
say
more
on
this
subject
but
i
am
impatient
to
remove
from
your
mind
the
prejudice
which
you
seem
to
have
imbibed
against
me
i
do
not
perfectly
understand
the
last
paragraph
in
your
letter
if
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
explain
it
to
me
you
may
depend
on
my
being
perfectly
ingenuous
indeed
i
have
no
difficulty
in
declaring
that
i
have
neither
encouraged
a
feeling
nor
uttered
a
word
capable
of
giving
the
lie
to
the
declaration
which
i
am
now
going
to
make
that
i
am
respect
and
esteem
obedient
servant
glenmurray
this
letter
had
an
effect
on
mrs
mowbray
feelings
so
much
in
favour
of
glenmurray
that
she
was
almost
determined
to
let
him
marry
adeline
she
felt
that
she
owed
her
some
amends
for
contracting
a
marriage
so
suddenly
and
without
either
her
knowledge
or
approbation
and
she
thought
that
by
marrying
her
to
the
man
of
her
heart
she
should
make
her
peace
both
with
adeline
and
herself
but
unfortunately
this
design
as
soon
as
it
began
to
be
formed
was
communicated
to
sir
patrick
then
exclaimed
he
have
forgotten
and
forgiven
the
impertinent
things
which
the
puppy
said
things
which
obliged
me
to
wear
this
little
useless
appendage
in
a
sling
thus
pointing
to
his
wounded
arm
no
my
dear
sir
patrick
but
though
what
mr
glenmurray
said
might
alarm
the
scrupulous
tenderness
of
a
lover
perhaps
it
was
a
remark
which
might
only
suit
the
sincerity
of
a
friend
perhaps
if
mr
glenmurray
had
made
it
to
me
i
should
have
heard
it
with
thanks
and
with
candour
have
approved
it
sweet
soul
replied
sir
patrick
may
be
as
candid
and
amiable
as
ever
you
please
but
st
patrick
never
shall
sir
patrick
be
to
the
notorious
and
infamous
glenmurray
that
subverter
of
all
religion
and
order
and
that
scourge
of
civilized
society
so
saying
he
stalked
about
the
room
and
mrs
mowbray
as
she
gazed
on
his
handsome
person
thought
it
would
be
absurd
for
her
to
sacrifice
her
own
happiness
to
her
daughter
and
give
up
sir
patrick
as
her
husband
in
order
to
make
glenmurray
her
son
she
therefore
wrote
another
letter
to
glenmurray
forbidding
him
any
further
intercourse
with
adeline
on
any
pretence
whatever
and
delayed
not
a
moment
to
send
him
her
final
decision
is
acting
like
the
sensible
woman
i
took
you
for
said
sir
patrick
fellow
has
now
gotten
his
quietus
i
trust
and
the
dear
little
adeline
is
reserved
for
happier
fate
sweet
soul
you
do
not
know
how
fond
she
will
be
of
me
i
protest
that
i
shall
be
so
kind
to
her
it
will
be
difficult
for
people
to
decide
which
i
love
best
the
daughter
or
the
mother
i
hope
shall
always
know
sir
patrick
said
mrs
mowbray
gravely
o
yes
to
be
sure
but
i
mean
that
my
fatherly
attentions
shall
be
of
the
warmest
kind
but
now
do
me
the
favour
of
telling
me
what
hour
tomorrow
i
may
appoint
the
clergyman
to
bring
the
license
the
conversation
that
followed
it
were
needless
and
tedious
to
describe
suffice
that
eight
the
next
morning
was
fixed
for
the
marriage
and
mrs
mowbray
either
from
shame
or
compassion
resolved
that
adeline
should
not
accompany
her
to
church
nor
even
know
of
the
ceremony
till
it
was
over
nor
was
this
a
difficult
matter
adeline
remained
in
her
own
apartment
all
the
preceding
day
endeavouring
but
in
vain
to
reconcile
herself
to
what
she
justly
termed
the
degradation
of
her
mother
she
felt
alas
the
most
painful
of
all
feelings
next
to
that
of
the
consciousness
of
the
abasement
of
one
to
whom
she
had
all
her
life
looked
up
with
love
and
veneration
to
write
to
glenmurray
while
oppressed
by
such
contending
emotions
she
knew
to
be
impossible
she
therefore
contented
herself
with
sending
a
verbal
message
importing
that
he
should
hear
from
her
the
next
day
and
poor
glenmurray
passed
the
rest
of
that
day
and
the
night
in
a
state
little
better
than
her
own
the
next
morning
adeline
who
had
not
closed
her
eyes
till
daylight
woke
late
and
from
a
sound
but
unrefreshing
sleep
the
first
object
she
saw
was
her
maid
smartly
dressed
sitting
by
her
and
she
also
saw
that
she
had
been
crying
my
mother
ill
evans
she
exclaimed
no
miss
adeline
quite
well
replied
the
girl
sighing
why
are
you
so
much
dressed
demanded
adeline
have
been
out
answered
the
maid
on
unpleasant
business
as
it
may
be
she
cried
turning
away
and
adeline
from
delicacy
forebore
to
press
her
further
very
late
is
it
not
asked
adeline
time
for
me
to
rise
miss
i
believe
you
had
better
get
up
adeline
immediately
me
the
dark
gown
i
wore
yesterday
said
she
think
miss
you
had
better
put
on
your
new
white
one
returned
the
maid
new
white
one
exclaimed
adeline
astonished
at
an
interference
so
new
miss
i
think
it
will
be
taken
kinder
and
look
better
at
these
words
adeline
suspicions
were
awakened
see
evans
she
cried
have
something
extraordinary
to
tell
me
i
partly
guess
i
my
mother
here
unable
to
proceed
she
lay
down
on
the
bed
which
she
had
just
quitted
miss
adeline
is
very
true
but
pray
compose
yourself
i
am
sure
i
have
cried
enough
on
your
account
that
i
have
is
true
my
good
evans
said
adeline
faintly
miss
my
lady
was
married
this
morning
to
sir
patrick
mercy
on
me
how
pale
you
look
i
am
sure
i
wish
the
villain
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
so
i
do
me
said
adeline
faintly
struggling
for
utterance
that
i
will
not
bluntly
replied
evans
are
not
fit
to
be
left
and
they
are
rejoicing
below
with
sir
pat
great
staring
servant
but
for
my
part
i
had
rather
stay
here
and
cry
with
you
than
laugh
with
them
adeline
hid
her
face
in
the
pillow
incapable
of
further
resistance
and
groaned
aloud
should
ever
have
thought
my
lady
would
have
done
so
continued
the
think
miss
they
say
and
i
doubt
it
is
too
true
that
there
have
been
no
writings
or
settlements
i
think
they
call
them
drawn
up
and
so
sir
pat
have
got
all
and
he
is
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
and
my
lady
is
to
pay
him
out
o
at
this
account
which
adeline
feared
was
a
just
one
as
she
had
seen
no
preparations
for
a
wedding
going
on
and
had
observed
no
signs
of
deeds
or
any
thing
of
the
kind
she
started
up
in
an
agony
of
grief
has
my
mother
given
me
up
indeed
she
exclaimed
clasping
her
hands
together
the
once
darling
child
may
soon
be
a
friendless
outcast
want
a
friend
miss
adeline
said
the
kind
girl
bursting
into
while
i
live
or
any
of
my
and
adeline
whose
heart
was
bursting
with
a
sense
of
forlornness
and
abandonment
felt
consoled
by
the
artless
sympathy
of
her
attendant
and
giving
way
to
a
violent
flood
of
tears
she
threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
sobbed
upon
her
bosom
having
thus
eased
her
feelings
she
recollected
that
it
was
incumbent
on
her
to
exert
her
fortitude
and
that
it
was
a
duty
which
she
owed
her
mother
not
to
condemn
her
conduct
openly
herself
nor
suffer
any
one
else
to
do
it
in
her
presence
still
at
that
moment
she
could
not
find
in
her
heart
to
reprove
the
observations
by
which
in
spite
of
her
sense
of
propriety
she
had
been
soothed
and
gratified
but
she
hastened
to
dress
herself
as
became
a
bridal
dinner
and
dismissed
as
soon
as
she
could
the
affectionate
evans
from
her
presence
she
then
walked
up
and
down
her
chamber
in
order
to
summon
courage
to
enter
the
how
strange
how
cruel
it
was
said
she
my
mother
did
not
come
to
inform
me
of
this
important
event
herself
in
this
respect
however
mrs
mowbray
had
acted
kindly
reluctant
even
more
than
she
was
willing
to
confess
to
her
own
heart
to
meet
adeline
alone
she
had
chosen
to
conclude
that
she
was
still
asleep
and
had
desired
she
might
not
be
disturbed
but
soon
after
her
return
from
church
being
assured
that
she
was
in
a
sound
slumber
she
had
stolen
to
her
and
put
a
note
under
her
pillow
acquainting
her
with
what
had
passed
but
this
note
adeline
in
her
restlessness
had
with
her
pillow
pushed
on
the
floor
and
there
unseen
it
had
remained
but
as
adeline
was
pacing
to
and
fro
she
luckily
observed
it
and
by
proving
that
her
mother
had
not
been
so
very
neglectful
of
her
it
tended
to
fortify
her
mind
against
the
succeeding
interview
the
note
began
dearest
child
to
spare
you
in
your
present
weak
state
the
emotion
which
you
would
necessarily
feel
in
attending
me
to
the
altar
i
have
resolved
to
let
the
ceremony
be
performed
unknown
to
you
but
my
beloved
adeline
i
trust
that
your
affection
for
me
will
make
you
rejoice
in
a
step
which
you
may
perhaps
at
present
disapprove
when
convinced
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
my
happiness
and
can
in
no
way
be
the
means
of
diminishing
yours
remain
ever
affectionate
mother
loves
me
still
then
cried
adeline
shedding
tears
of
tenderness
i
accused
her
o
my
dear
mother
if
this
event
should
indeed
increase
your
happiness
never
shall
i
repine
at
not
having
been
able
to
prevent
it
and
then
after
taking
two
or
three
hasty
turns
round
the
room
and
bathing
her
eyes
to
remove
in
a
degree
the
traces
of
her
tears
she
ventured
into
the
but
the
sight
of
her
mother
seated
by
sir
patrick
his
arm
encircling
her
waist
in
that
very
room
which
had
so
lately
witnessed
his
profligate
attempts
on
herself
deprived
her
of
the
little
resolution
which
she
had
been
able
to
assume
and
pale
and
trembling
she
sunk
speechless
with
emotion
on
the
first
chair
near
her
mrs
mowbray
or
as
we
must
at
present
call
her
lady
was
affected
by
adeline
distress
and
hastening
to
her
received
the
almost
fainting
girl
in
her
arms
while
even
sir
patrick
feeling
compassion
for
the
unhappiness
which
he
could
more
readily
understand
than
his
bride
was
eager
to
hide
his
confusion
by
calling
for
water
drops
and
servants
want
neither
medicine
nor
assistance
now
said
adeline
gently
raising
her
head
from
her
mother
shoulder
shock
is
over
and
i
shall
i
trust
behave
in
future
with
proper
late
than
never
muttered
lady
on
whom
the
word
had
not
made
a
pleasant
impression
while
sir
patrick
approaching
adeline
exclaimed
you
have
not
miss
mowbray
it
is
the
only
command
which
you
can
not
boast
for
your
power
of
commanding
others
no
one
can
dispute
who
has
ever
had
the
happiness
of
beholding
you
so
saying
he
took
her
hand
and
as
her
mother
husband
claimed
the
privilege
of
saluting
her
a
privilege
which
adeline
though
she
almost
shrunk
with
horror
from
his
touch
had
enough
not
to
deny
him
immediately
after
he
claimed
the
same
favour
from
his
bride
and
they
resumed
their
position
on
the
sofa
but
so
embarrassing
was
the
situation
of
all
parties
that
no
conversation
took
place
and
adeline
unable
any
longer
to
endure
the
restraint
to
which
she
was
obliged
rose
to
return
to
her
own
room
in
order
to
hide
the
sorrow
which
she
was
on
the
point
of
betraying
when
her
mother
in
a
tone
of
reproach
exclaimed
grieves
me
to
the
soul
miss
mowbray
to
perceive
that
you
appear
to
consider
as
a
day
of
mourning
the
day
which
i
consider
as
the
happiest
of
my
life
my
dearest
mother
replied
adeline
returning
and
approaching
her
is
the
dread
of
your
deceiving
yourself
only
that
makes
me
sad
at
a
time
like
this
if
this
day
in
its
consequences
prove
a
happy
one
wherefore
should
you
doubt
that
it
will
miss
mowbray
mowbray
do
you
doubt
my
honour
cried
sir
patrick
hastily
adeline
instantly
fixed
her
fine
eyes
on
his
face
with
a
look
which
he
knew
how
to
interpret
but
not
how
to
support
and
he
cast
his
to
the
ground
with
painful
consciousness
she
saw
her
triumph
and
it
gave
her
courage
to
proceed
sir
she
cried
is
in
your
power
to
convert
all
my
painful
doubts
into
joyful
certainties
make
but
my
mother
happy
and
i
will
love
and
bless
you
promise
me
sir
she
continued
her
enthusiasm
and
affection
kindling
as
she
spoke
me
to
be
kind
and
indulgent
to
her
she
has
never
known
contradiction
she
has
been
through
life
the
darling
object
of
all
who
surrounded
her
the
pride
of
her
parents
her
husband
and
her
child
neglect
injury
and
unkindness
she
would
inevitably
sink
under
and
i
conjure
you
here
she
dropped
on
her
knees
and
extended
her
arms
in
an
attitude
of
entreaty
by
all
your
hopes
of
happiness
hereafter
to
give
her
reason
to
continue
to
name
this
the
happiest
day
of
her
life
here
she
ceased
overcome
by
the
violence
of
her
emotions
but
continued
her
look
and
attitude
of
entreaty
full
of
such
sweet
earnestness
that
the
baronet
could
hardly
conceal
the
variety
of
feelings
which
assailed
him
amongst
which
passion
for
the
lovely
object
before
him
predominated
to
make
a
jest
of
adeline
seriousness
he
conceived
to
be
the
best
way
to
conceal
what
he
felt
and
while
mrs
mowbray
overcome
with
adeline
expressions
of
tenderness
was
giving
way
to
them
by
a
flood
of
tears
and
grasping
in
both
hers
the
clasped
hands
of
adeline
he
cried
in
an
ironical
tone
are
the
most
extraordinary
motherly
young
creature
that
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
my
dear
girl
instead
of
your
mother
giving
the
nuptial
benediction
to
you
the
order
of
nature
is
reversed
and
you
are
giving
it
to
her
upon
my
word
i
begin
to
think
seeing
you
in
that
posture
that
you
are
my
bride
begging
a
blessing
of
mamma
on
our
union
and
that
i
ought
to
be
on
my
knees
too
so
saying
he
knelt
beside
adeline
at
lady
feet
and
in
a
tone
of
mock
solemnity
besought
her
to
bless
both
her
affectionate
children
and
as
he
did
this
he
threw
his
arm
round
the
weeping
girl
and
pressed
her
to
his
bosom
this
speech
and
this
action
at
once
banished
all
from
the
indignant
adeline
and
in
an
instant
she
sprung
from
his
embrace
and
forgetting
how
much
her
violence
must
surprise
if
not
alarm
and
offend
her
mother
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
and
did
not
stop
till
she
had
reached
her
own
chamber
when
there
she
was
alarmed
lest
her
conduct
should
have
occasioned
both
pain
and
resentment
to
lady
and
it
was
with
trembling
reluctance
that
she
obeyed
the
summons
to
dinner
but
her
fears
were
groundless
the
bride
had
fallen
into
one
of
her
reveries
during
sir
patrick
strange
speech
from
which
she
awakened
only
at
the
last
words
of
it
viz
children
and
seeing
sir
patrick
at
her
feet
with
a
very
tender
expression
on
his
face
and
hearing
the
words
children
she
conceived
that
he
was
expressing
his
hopes
of
their
being
blest
with
progeny
and
that
a
selfish
feeling
of
fear
at
such
a
prospect
had
hurried
adeline
out
of
the
room
she
was
therefore
disposed
to
regard
her
daughter
with
pity
but
not
with
resentment
when
she
entered
the
and
adeline
tranquillity
in
a
degree
returned
but
when
she
retired
for
the
night
she
could
not
help
owning
to
herself
that
that
day
her
mother
wedding
day
had
been
the
most
painful
of
her
existence
and
she
literally
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
the
next
morning
a
new
trial
awaited
her
she
had
to
write
a
final
farewell
to
glenmurray
many
letters
did
she
begin
many
did
she
finish
and
many
did
she
tear
but
recollecting
that
the
longer
she
delayed
sending
him
one
the
longer
she
kept
him
in
a
state
of
agitating
suspense
she
resolved
to
send
the
last
written
even
though
it
appeared
to
her
not
quite
so
strong
a
transcript
of
her
feelings
as
the
former
ones
whether
it
was
so
or
not
glenmurray
received
it
with
alternate
agony
and
transport
with
agony
because
it
destroyed
every
hope
of
adeline
being
his
and
with
transport
because
every
line
breathed
the
purest
and
yet
most
ardent
attachment
and
convinced
him
that
however
long
their
separation
the
love
of
adeline
would
experience
no
change
many
days
elapsed
before
glenmurray
could
bear
any
companion
but
the
letter
of
adeline
and
during
that
time
she
was
on
the
road
with
the
bride
and
bridegroom
to
a
beautiful
seat
in
berkshire
called
the
pavilion
hired
by
sir
patrick
the
week
before
his
marriage
of
one
of
his
profligate
friends
as
the
road
lay
through
a
very
fine
country
adeline
would
have
thought
the
journey
a
pleasant
one
had
not
the
idea
of
glenmurray
ill
and
dejected
continually
haunted
her
sir
patrick
appeared
to
be
engrossed
by
his
bride
and
she
was
really
wholly
wrapt
up
in
him
and
at
times
the
beauties
of
the
scenery
around
had
power
to
engage
adeline
attention
but
she
immediately
recollected
how
much
glenmurray
would
have
participated
in
her
delight
and
the
contemplation
of
the
prospect
ended
in
renewed
recollections
of
him
chapter
ix
at
length
they
arrived
at
the
place
of
their
destination
and
sir
patrick
warmly
embracing
his
bride
bade
her
welcome
to
her
new
abode
and
immediately
approaching
adeline
he
bestowed
on
her
an
embrace
no
less
cordial
or
to
say
the
truth
so
ardent
seemed
the
welcome
even
to
the
innocent
adeline
that
she
vainly
endeavoured
to
persuade
herself
that
as
her
sir
patrick
tenderness
was
excusable
spite
of
her
efforts
to
be
cheerful
she
was
angry
and
suspicious
and
had
an
indistinct
feeling
of
remote
danger
which
though
she
could
not
define
even
to
herself
it
was
new
and
painful
to
her
to
experience
but
as
the
elastic
mind
of
eighteen
soon
rebounds
from
the
pressure
of
sorrow
and
forgets
in
present
enjoyment
the
prospect
of
evil
adeline
gazed
on
the
elegant
apartment
she
was
in
with
joyful
surprise
while
through
folding
doors
on
either
side
of
it
she
beheld
a
suite
of
rooms
all
furnished
with
a
degree
of
tasteful
simplicity
such
as
she
had
never
before
beheld
and
through
the
windows
which
opened
on
a
lawn
that
sloped
to
the
banks
of
a
rapid
river
she
saw
an
amphitheatre
of
wooded
hills
which
proved
that
how
great
soever
had
been
the
efforts
of
art
to
decorate
their
new
habitation
the
hand
of
nature
had
done
still
more
to
embellish
it
and
all
fear
of
sir
patrick
was
lost
in
gratitude
for
his
having
chosen
such
a
retirement
with
eager
curiosity
adeline
hurried
from
room
to
room
admired
in
the
western
apartments
the
fine
effect
of
the
declining
sun
shining
through
window
curtains
gazed
with
delight
on
the
statues
and
pictures
that
every
where
met
the
eye
and
reposed
with
unsuspecting
gaiety
on
the
couches
of
eider
down
which
were
in
profusion
around
every
thing
in
the
house
spoke
it
to
be
the
temple
of
pleasure
but
the
innocent
adeline
and
her
unobservant
mother
saw
nothing
but
elegant
convenience
in
an
abode
in
which
the
disciples
of
epicurus
might
have
delighted
and
while
æolian
harps
in
the
windows
and
perfumes
of
all
kinds
added
to
the
enchantment
of
the
scene
the
bride
only
beheld
in
the
choice
of
the
villa
a
proof
of
her
husband
desire
of
making
her
happy
and
adeline
sighed
for
virtuous
love
and
glenmurray
as
all
that
was
wanting
to
complete
her
fascination
sir
patrick
meanwhile
was
not
blind
to
the
impressions
made
on
adeline
by
the
beauty
of
the
spot
which
he
had
chosen
though
he
was
far
from
suspecting
the
companion
she
had
pictured
to
herself
as
most
fitted
to
enjoy
and
embellish
it
and
pleased
because
she
was
pleased
and
delighted
to
be
regarded
by
her
with
such
unusual
looks
of
complacency
he
gave
himself
up
to
his
natural
vivacity
and
adeline
passed
a
merry
if
not
a
happy
evening
with
the
bride
and
bridegroom
but
the
next
morning
she
arose
with
the
painful
conviction
as
fresh
as
ever
on
her
mind
that
day
would
succeed
to
day
and
yet
she
should
not
behold
glenmurray
and
that
day
would
succeed
to
day
and
still
should
she
see
still
be
exposed
to
his
noisy
mirth
to
his
odious
familiarities
which
though
she
taught
herself
to
believe
they
proceeded
merely
from
the
customs
of
his
country
and
the
nearness
of
their
relationship
it
was
to
her
most
painful
to
endure
her
only
resource
therefore
from
unpleasant
thoughts
was
reading
and
she
eagerly
opened
the
cases
of
books
in
the
library
which
were
unlocked
but
on
taking
down
some
of
the
books
she
was
disappointed
to
find
none
of
the
kind
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
mrs
peculiar
taste
had
led
her
as
we
have
before
observed
to
the
perusal
of
nothing
but
political
tracts
systems
of
philosophy
and
and
other
romances
scarcely
had
the
works
of
our
best
poets
found
their
way
to
her
library
and
novels
plays
and
works
of
a
lighter
kind
she
was
never
in
the
habit
of
reading
herself
and
consequently
had
not
put
in
the
hands
of
her
daughter
adeline
had
therefore
read
but
not
his
montesquieu
des
but
not
his
and
had
glowed
with
republican
ardour
over
the
scenes
of
voltaire
but
had
never
had
her
mind
polluted
by
the
pages
of
his
romances
different
had
been
the
circumstances
and
consequently
the
practice
of
the
owner
of
sir
patrick
new
abode
of
all
rousseau
works
he
had
in
his
library
only
the
and
his
of
montesquieu
none
but
the
glowing
letters
and
while
voltaire
chaste
and
moral
tragedies
were
excluded
his
profligate
tales
attracted
the
eye
by
the
peculiar
elegance
of
their
binding
while
dangerous
french
novels
of
all
descriptions
met
the
view
under
the
downy
pillows
of
the
inviting
sofas
around
calculated
to
inflame
the
fancy
and
corrupt
the
morals
but
adeline
unprepared
by
any
reading
of
the
kind
to
receive
and
relish
the
poison
contained
in
them
turned
with
disgust
from
pages
so
uncongenial
to
her
feelings
nor
did
her
eye
dwell
delighted
on
any
of
the
stores
which
the
shelves
contained
disappointment
in
her
hopes
of
finding
amusement
in
reading
adeline
had
recourse
to
walking
and
none
of
the
beautiful
scenes
around
remained
long
unexplored
by
her
in
her
rambles
she
but
too
frequently
saw
scenes
of
poverty
and
distress
which
ill
contrasted
with
the
beauty
of
the
house
which
she
inhabited
scenes
which
even
a
small
portion
of
the
money
expended
there
in
useless
decoration
would
have
entirely
alleviated
and
they
were
scenes
too
which
adeline
had
been
accustomed
to
relieve
the
extreme
of
poverty
in
the
cottage
did
not
disgrace
on
the
mowbray
estate
the
but
adeline
as
we
have
observed
before
was
allowed
to
draw
on
her
mother
for
money
sufficient
to
prevent
industrious
labour
from
knowing
the
distress
of
want
why
should
i
not
draw
on
her
here
for
money
for
the
same
purposes
cried
adeline
to
herself
as
she
beheld
one
spectacle
of
peculiar
my
mother
is
not
dependent
on
her
husband
and
even
if
she
were
sir
patrick
has
not
a
hard
heart
and
will
not
refuse
my
prayer
and
therefore
promising
the
sufferers
instant
relief
she
left
them
saying
she
should
soon
reach
the
pavilion
and
be
back
again
while
the
objects
of
her
bounty
were
silent
with
surprise
at
hearing
that
their
relief
was
to
come
from
the
pavilion
a
place
hitherto
closed
to
the
solicitations
of
poverty
though
ever
open
to
the
revels
and
the
votaries
of
pleasure
adeline
found
her
mother
alone
and
with
a
beating
heart
and
a
flushed
cheek
she
described
the
scene
which
she
had
witnessed
and
begged
to
be
restored
to
her
old
office
of
almoner
on
such
occasions
sad
scene
indeed
my
dear
adeline
replied
the
bride
in
evident
embarrassment
i
will
speak
to
sir
patrick
about
it
to
sir
patrick
madam
can
not
you
follow
the
impulse
of
humanity
without
consulting
him
ca
give
the
relief
you
ask
without
his
assistance
replied
her
mother
except
a
guinea
or
so
i
have
no
loose
cash
about
me
for
my
own
sir
patrick
benevolence
has
long
ago
emptied
his
purse
and
i
gladly
surrendered
mine
to
him
shall
you
in
future
have
no
money
for
the
purposes
of
charity
but
that
you
must
claim
from
sir
patrick
asked
adeline
mournfully
dear
yes
i
have
a
very
handsome
allowance
settled
on
me
but
then
at
present
he
wants
it
himself
adeline
involuntarily
clasped
her
hands
together
in
an
agony
and
sighed
deeply
but
however
child
added
the
bride
you
seem
to
make
such
a
point
of
it
take
this
guinea
to
the
cottage
you
mention
adeline
took
the
guinea
but
it
was
very
insufficient
to
pay
for
medical
attendance
to
discharge
the
rent
due
to
a
clamorous
landlord
and
to
purchase
several
things
necessary
for
the
relief
of
the
poor
sufferers
therefore
she
added
another
guinea
to
it
and
not
liking
to
relate
her
disappointment
sent
the
money
to
them
desiring
the
servant
to
say
that
she
would
see
them
the
next
morning
when
she
resolved
to
apply
to
sir
patrick
for
the
relief
which
her
mother
could
not
give
feeling
at
the
same
time
the
mournful
conviction
that
she
herself
as
well
as
her
mother
would
be
in
future
dependent
on
his
bounty
though
disposed
to
give
way
to
mournful
reflections
on
her
own
account
adeline
roused
herself
from
the
melancholy
abstraction
into
which
she
was
falling
by
reflecting
that
she
had
still
to
plead
the
cause
of
the
poor
cottagers
with
sir
patrick
and
hearing
he
was
in
the
house
she
hastened
to
prefer
her
petition
sir
patrick
listened
to
her
tone
of
voice
and
gazed
on
her
expressive
countenance
with
delight
but
when
she
had
concluded
her
narration
a
solitary
was
all
he
bestowed
on
her
saying
am
never
roused
to
charity
by
the
descriptions
of
others
i
must
always
see
the
distress
which
i
am
solicited
to
relieve
go
with
me
to
the
cottage
exclaimed
adeline
but
to
her
great
mortification
he
only
smiled
bowed
and
disappeared
and
when
he
returned
to
supper
adeline
could
scarcely
prevail
on
herself
to
look
at
him
without
displeasure
and
could
not
endure
the
unfeeling
vivacity
of
his
manner
mortified
and
unhappy
she
next
morning
went
to
the
cottage
reluctant
to
impart
to
its
expecting
inhabitants
the
ill
success
she
had
experienced
but
what
was
her
surprise
when
they
came
out
joyfully
to
meet
her
and
told
her
that
a
gentleman
had
been
there
that
morning
very
early
had
discharged
their
debts
and
given
them
a
sum
of
money
for
their
future
wants
name
his
name
eagerly
inquired
adeline
but
that
they
said
he
refused
to
give
and
as
he
was
in
a
horseman
large
coat
and
held
a
hankerchief
to
his
face
they
were
sure
they
should
not
know
him
again
a
pleasing
suspicion
immediately
came
across
adeline
mind
that
this
benevolent
unknown
might
be
glenmurray
and
the
idea
that
he
was
perhaps
unseen
hovering
round
her
gave
her
one
of
the
most
exquisite
feelings
which
she
had
ever
known
but
this
agreeable
delusion
was
soon
dissipated
by
one
of
the
children
giving
her
a
card
which
the
kind
stranger
had
dropped
from
his
pocket
and
this
card
had
on
it
patrick
at
first
it
was
natural
for
her
to
be
hurt
and
disappointed
at
finding
that
her
hopes
concerning
glenmurray
had
no
foundation
in
truth
but
her
benevolence
and
indeed
regard
for
her
mother
happiness
as
well
as
her
own
led
her
to
rejoice
in
this
unexpected
proof
of
excellence
in
sir
he
had
evidently
proved
that
he
loved
to
do
good
by
stealth
and
had
withdrawn
himself
even
from
her
thanks
in
a
moment
therefore
she
banished
from
her
mind
every
trace
of
his
unworthiness
she
had
done
him
injustice
and
she
sought
refuge
from
the
remorse
which
this
consciousness
inflicted
on
her
by
going
into
the
opposite
extreme
from
that
hour
indeed
her
complaisance
to
his
opinions
and
her
attentions
to
him
were
so
unremitting
and
evident
that
sir
patrick
passion
became
stronger
than
ever
and
his
hopes
of
a
return
to
it
seemed
to
be
built
on
a
very
strong
foundation
adeline
had
given
all
her
former
suspicions
to
the
wind
daily
instances
of
his
benevolence
came
to
her
knowledge
and
threw
such
a
charm
over
all
he
said
and
did
that
even
the
familiarity
in
his
conduct
look
and
manner
towards
her
appeared
to
her
now
nothing
more
than
the
result
of
the
free
manners
of
his
countrymen
and
she
sometimes
could
not
help
wishing
sir
patrick
to
be
known
to
and
intimate
with
glenmurray
but
the
moment
was
now
at
hand
that
was
to
unveil
the
real
character
of
sir
patrick
and
determine
the
destiny
of
adeline
one
day
sir
patrick
proposed
taking
his
bride
to
see
a
beautiful
at
about
twelve
miles
distance
and
if
it
answered
the
expectations
which
he
had
formed
of
it
they
were
determined
to
spend
two
or
three
days
in
the
neighbourhood
to
enjoy
the
beauty
of
the
grounds
in
that
case
he
was
to
return
in
the
evening
to
the
pavilion
and
drive
adeline
over
the
next
morning
to
partake
in
their
pleasure
to
this
scheme
both
the
ladies
gladly
consented
as
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
suspect
the
villainous
design
which
it
was
intended
to
aid
the
truth
was
that
sir
patrick
having
as
he
fondly
imagined
gained
adeline
affections
resolved
to
defer
no
longer
the
profligate
attempt
which
he
had
long
meditated
and
had
contrived
this
excursion
in
order
to
insure
his
wife
absence
from
home
and
a
with
her
daughter
at
an
early
hour
the
curricle
was
at
the
door
and
sir
patrick
having
handed
his
lady
in
took
leave
of
adeline
he
told
her
that
he
should
probably
return
early
in
the
evening
pressed
her
hand
more
tenderly
than
usual
and
springing
into
the
carriage
drove
off
with
a
countenance
animated
with
expected
triumph
adeline
immediately
set
out
on
a
long
walk
to
the
adjoining
villages
visited
the
cottages
near
the
pavilion
and
having
dined
at
an
early
hour
determined
to
pass
the
rest
of
the
day
in
reading
provided
it
was
possible
for
her
to
find
any
book
in
the
house
proper
for
her
perusal
with
this
intention
she
repaired
to
an
apartment
called
the
library
but
what
in
these
times
would
be
denominated
a
and
this
even
in
paris
would
have
been
admired
for
its
voluptuous
on
the
table
lay
several
costly
volumes
which
seemed
to
have
been
very
lately
perused
by
sir
patrick
as
some
of
them
were
open
some
turned
down
at
particular
passages
but
as
soon
as
she
glanced
her
eye
over
their
contents
adeline
indignantly
threw
them
down
again
and
while
her
cheek
glowed
with
the
blush
of
offended
modesty
she
threw
herself
on
a
sofa
and
fell
into
a
long
and
mournful
reverie
on
the
misery
which
awaited
her
mother
in
consequence
of
her
having
madly
dared
to
unite
herself
for
life
to
a
young
libertine
who
could
delight
in
no
other
reading
but
what
was
offensive
to
good
morals
and
to
delicacy
nor
could
she
dwell
upon
this
subject
without
recurring
to
her
former
fears
for
herself
and
so
lost
was
she
in
agonizing
reflections
that
it
was
some
time
before
she
recollected
herself
sufficiently
to
remember
that
she
was
guilty
of
an
indecorum
in
staying
so
long
in
an
apartment
which
contained
books
that
she
ought
not
even
to
be
suspected
of
having
had
an
opportunity
to
peruse
having
once
entertained
this
consciousness
adeline
hastily
arose
and
had
just
reached
the
door
when
sir
patrick
himself
appeared
at
it
she
started
back
in
terror
when
she
beheld
him
on
observing
in
his
countenance
and
manner
evident
marks
not
only
of
determined
profligacy
but
of
intoxication
her
suspicions
were
indeed
just
bold
as
he
was
in
iniquity
he
dared
not
in
a
cool
and
sober
moment
put
his
guilty
purpose
in
execution
and
he
shrunk
with
temporary
horror
from
an
attempt
on
the
honour
of
the
daughter
of
his
wife
though
he
believed
that
she
would
be
a
willing
victim
he
had
therefore
stopped
on
the
road
to
fortify
his
courage
with
wine
and
luckily
for
adeline
he
had
taken
more
than
he
was
aware
of
for
when
after
a
vehement
declaration
of
the
ardour
of
his
passion
he
dared
irreverently
to
approach
her
adeline
strong
in
innocence
aware
of
his
intention
and
presuming
on
his
situation
disengaged
herself
from
his
grasp
with
ease
and
pushing
him
with
violence
from
her
he
fell
with
such
force
against
the
brass
edge
of
one
of
the
sofas
that
stunned
and
wounded
by
the
fall
he
lay
bleeding
on
the
ground
adeline
involuntarily
was
hastening
to
his
assistance
but
recollecting
how
mischievous
to
her
such
an
exertion
of
humanity
might
be
she
contented
herself
with
ringing
the
bell
violently
to
call
the
servants
to
his
aid
then
in
almost
frantic
haste
she
rushed
out
of
the
house
ran
across
the
park
and
when
she
recovered
her
emotion
she
found
herself
she
scarcely
knew
how
sitting
on
a
turf
seat
by
the
road
side
will
become
of
me
she
wildly
exclaimed
mother
roof
is
no
longer
a
protection
to
me
i
can
not
absent
myself
from
it
without
alleging
a
reason
for
my
conduct
which
will
ruin
her
peace
of
mind
for
ever
wretch
that
i
am
whither
can
i
go
and
where
can
i
seek
for
refuge
at
this
moment
as
she
looked
around
in
wild
dismay
and
raised
her
streaming
eyes
to
heaven
she
saw
a
man
face
peeping
from
between
the
branches
of
a
tree
opposite
to
her
and
observed
that
he
was
gazing
on
her
intently
alarmed
and
fluttered
she
instantly
started
from
her
seat
and
was
hastening
away
when
the
man
suddenly
dropped
from
his
and
running
after
her
called
her
by
her
name
and
conjured
her
to
stop
while
with
an
emotion
of
surprise
and
delight
she
recognized
in
him
arthur
the
servant
of
glenmurray
instantly
scarcely
knowing
what
she
did
she
pressed
the
astonished
arthur
rough
hand
in
hers
and
by
this
action
confused
and
confounded
the
poor
fellow
so
much
that
the
speech
which
he
was
going
to
make
faltered
on
his
tongue
where
is
your
master
eagerly
inquired
adeline
master
has
sent
you
this
miss
replied
arthur
holding
out
a
letter
which
adeline
joyfully
received
and
spite
of
her
intended
obedience
to
her
mother
will
glenmurray
himself
could
not
have
met
with
a
more
favourable
reception
for
the
moment
was
a
most
propitious
one
to
his
love
nor
as
it
happened
was
glenmurray
too
far
off
to
profit
by
it
on
his
way
from
bath
he
went
a
few
miles
out
of
his
road
in
order
as
he
said
and
perhaps
as
he
thought
to
pay
a
visit
to
an
old
servant
of
his
mother
who
was
married
to
a
respectable
farmer
but
fortunately
the
farm
commanded
a
view
of
the
pavilion
and
glenmurray
could
from
his
window
gaze
on
the
house
that
contained
the
woman
of
his
affections
but
to
return
to
adeline
who
while
hastily
tearing
open
the
letter
asked
arthur
where
his
master
was
and
heard
with
indescribable
emotion
that
he
was
in
the
neighbourhood
so
providentially
she
exclaimed
and
proceeded
to
read
the
letter
but
her
emotion
forbade
her
to
read
it
entirely
she
only
saw
that
it
contained
banknotes
that
glenmurray
was
going
abroad
for
his
health
and
in
case
he
should
die
there
had
sent
her
the
money
which
he
had
meant
to
leave
her
in
his
will
lest
she
should
be
in
the
meanwhile
any
way
dependent
on
sir
patrick
numberless
conflicting
emotions
took
possession
of
adeline
heart
while
the
new
proof
of
her
lover
attentive
tenderness
met
her
view
and
as
she
contrasted
his
generous
and
delicate
attachment
with
the
licentious
passion
of
her
mother
libertine
husband
a
burst
of
uncontrollable
affection
for
glenmurray
agitated
her
bosom
and
rendered
superstitious
by
her
fears
she
looked
on
him
as
sent
by
providence
to
save
her
from
the
dangers
of
her
home
is
the
second
time
cried
she
glenmurray
as
my
guardian
angel
has
appeared
at
the
moment
when
i
was
exposed
to
danger
from
the
same
guilty
quarter
ah
surely
there
is
more
than
accident
in
this
and
he
is
ordained
to
be
my
guide
and
my
protector
when
once
a
woman
has
associated
with
an
amiable
man
the
idea
of
protection
he
can
never
again
be
indifferent
to
her
and
when
the
protector
happens
to
be
the
chosen
object
of
her
love
his
power
becomes
fixed
on
a
basis
never
to
be
shaken
is
enough
said
adeline
in
a
faltering
voice
pressing
the
letter
to
her
lips
and
bursting
into
tears
of
grateful
tenderness
as
she
spoke
me
to
your
master
directly
my
heart
will
you
see
him
then
miss
cried
arthur
him
replied
adeline
the
only
friend
i
now
can
boast
but
let
us
be
gone
this
moment
lest
i
should
be
seen
and
pursued
instantly
guided
by
arthur
adeline
set
off
full
speed
for
the
nor
stopped
till
she
found
herself
in
the
presence
of
glenmurray
i
am
safe
now
exclaimed
adeline
throwing
herself
into
his
arms
while
he
was
so
overcome
with
surprise
and
joy
that
he
could
not
speak
the
welcome
which
his
heart
gave
her
and
adeline
happy
to
behold
him
again
was
as
silent
as
her
lover
at
length
glenmurray
exclaimed
we
then
meet
again
adeline
replied
she
we
meet
to
part
no
more
not
mock
me
cried
glenmurray
starting
from
his
seat
and
seizing
her
extended
hand
feelings
must
not
be
trifled
with
am
i
a
woman
to
trifle
with
them
glenmurray
i
come
to
you
for
safety
and
protection
i
come
to
seek
shelter
in
your
arms
from
misery
and
dishonour
you
are
ill
you
are
going
into
a
foreign
country
and
from
this
moment
look
on
me
as
your
nurse
your
companion
your
home
shall
be
my
home
your
country
my
country
glenmurray
too
much
agitated
too
happy
to
speak
could
only
press
the
agitated
girl
to
his
bosom
and
fold
his
arms
round
her
as
if
to
assure
her
of
the
protection
which
she
claimed
there
is
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
cried
adeline
may
be
missed
and
pursued
let
us
be
gone
directly
the
first
word
was
enough
for
glenmurray
eager
to
secure
the
recovered
treasure
which
he
had
thought
for
ever
lost
his
orders
were
given
and
executed
by
the
faithful
arthur
with
the
utmost
dispatch
and
even
before
adeline
had
explained
to
him
the
cause
of
her
resolution
to
elope
with
him
they
were
on
their
road
to
cornwall
meaning
to
embark
at
falmouth
for
lisbon
but
arthur
who
was
going
to
marry
and
leave
glenmurray
service
received
orders
to
stay
at
the
farm
till
he
had
learned
how
sir
patrick
was
and
having
obtained
the
necessary
information
he
was
to
send
it
to
glenmurray
at
falmouth
the
next
morning
he
saw
sir
patrick
himself
driving
full
speed
past
the
farm
and
having
written
immediately
to
his
master
adeline
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
she
had
not
purchased
her
own
safety
by
the
sufferings
or
danger
of
her
persecutor
and
the
consequent
misery
of
her
mother
chapter
x
but
glenmurray
heart
needed
no
explanation
of
the
cause
of
elopement
she
was
with
him
with
him
as
she
said
for
ever
true
she
had
talked
of
flying
from
misery
and
dishonour
but
he
knew
they
could
not
reach
her
in
his
arms
not
even
dishonour
according
to
the
ideas
of
society
for
he
meant
to
make
adeline
legally
his
as
soon
as
they
were
safe
from
pursuit
and
his
illness
was
forgotten
in
the
fond
transport
of
the
present
moment
adeline
joy
was
of
a
much
shorter
duration
recollections
of
a
most
painful
nature
were
continually
recurring
true
it
was
that
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
her
to
reside
under
the
roof
of
her
mother
but
was
it
necessary
for
her
to
elope
with
glenmurray
the
man
whom
she
had
solemnly
promised
her
mother
to
renounce
then
on
the
other
side
she
argued
that
the
appearance
of
love
for
glenmurray
was
an
excuse
sufficient
to
conceal
from
her
deluded
parent
the
real
cause
of
her
elopement
was
my
sole
alternative
said
she
mentally
mother
must
either
suppose
me
an
unworthy
child
or
know
sir
patrick
to
be
an
unworthy
husband
and
it
will
be
easier
for
her
to
support
the
knowledge
of
the
one
than
the
other
then
when
she
forgives
me
as
no
doubt
she
will
in
time
i
shall
be
happy
but
that
i
could
never
be
while
convinced
that
i
had
made
her
miserable
by
revealing
to
her
the
wickedness
of
sir
patrick
while
this
was
passing
in
her
mind
her
countenance
was
full
of
such
anxious
and
mournful
expression
that
glenmurray
unable
to
keep
silence
any
longer
conjured
her
to
tell
him
what
so
evidently
weighed
upon
her
spirits
difficulty
that
oppressed
me
is
past
she
replied
wiping
from
her
eyes
the
tears
which
the
thought
of
having
left
her
mother
so
unexpectedly
and
for
the
first
time
produced
have
convinced
myself
that
to
leave
home
and
commit
myself
to
your
protection
was
the
most
proper
and
virtuous
step
that
i
could
take
i
have
not
obeyed
the
dictates
of
love
but
of
reason
am
very
sorry
to
hear
it
said
glenmurray
mournfully
seems
to
me
so
very
rational
to
love
you
returned
adeline
tenderly
shocked
at
the
sad
expression
of
his
countenance
what
seems
to
be
the
dictates
of
reason
may
be
those
of
love
only
to
a
reply
like
this
glenmurray
could
only
answer
by
close
involvement
not
intelligible
expressions
of
fondness
to
the
object
of
them
which
are
so
delightful
to
lovers
themselves
and
so
uninteresting
to
other
people
nay
so
entirely
was
glenmurray
again
engrossed
by
the
sense
of
present
happiness
that
his
curiosity
was
still
suspended
and
story
remained
untold
but
adeline
pleasure
was
damped
by
painful
recollections
and
still
more
by
her
not
being
able
to
hide
from
herself
the
mournful
consciousness
that
the
ravages
of
sickness
were
but
too
visible
in
glenmurray
face
and
figure
and
that
the
flush
of
unexpected
delight
could
but
ill
conceal
the
hollow
paleness
of
his
cheek
and
the
sunk
appearance
of
his
eyes
meanwhile
the
chaise
rolled
on
post
succeeded
to
post
and
though
night
was
far
advanced
adeline
fearful
of
being
pursued
would
not
consent
to
stop
and
they
travelled
till
morning
but
glenmurray
feeling
himself
exhausted
prevailed
on
her
for
his
sake
to
alight
at
a
small
inn
on
the
road
side
near
marlborough
there
adeline
narrated
the
occurrences
of
the
past
day
but
with
difficulty
could
she
prevail
on
herself
to
own
to
glenmurray
that
she
had
been
the
object
of
such
an
outrage
as
she
had
experienced
from
sir
patrick
a
truly
delicate
woman
feels
degraded
not
flattered
by
being
the
object
of
libertine
attempts
and
situated
as
adeline
and
glenmurray
now
were
to
disclose
the
insult
which
had
been
offered
to
her
was
a
still
more
difficult
task
but
to
conceal
it
was
impossible
she
felt
that
even
to
him
some
justification
of
her
precipitate
and
unsolicited
flight
was
necessary
and
nothing
but
sir
patrick
attempt
could
justify
it
she
therefore
blushing
and
hesitating
revealed
the
disgraceful
secret
but
such
was
its
effect
on
the
weak
spirits
and
delicate
health
of
glenmurray
that
the
violent
emotions
which
he
underwent
brought
on
a
return
of
his
most
alarming
symptoms
and
in
a
few
hours
adeline
bending
over
the
sick
bed
of
her
lover
experienced
for
the
first
time
that
most
dreadful
of
feelings
fear
for
the
life
of
the
object
of
her
affections
two
days
however
restored
him
to
comparative
safety
and
they
reached
a
small
and
obscure
village
within
a
short
distance
from
falmouth
most
conveniently
situated
there
they
took
up
their
abode
and
resolved
to
remain
till
the
wind
should
change
and
enable
them
to
sail
for
lisbon
in
this
retreat
situated
in
air
as
salubrious
as
that
of
the
south
of
france
glenmurray
was
soon
restored
to
health
especially
as
happy
love
was
now
his
and
brought
back
the
health
of
which
hopeless
love
had
contributed
to
deprive
him
the
woman
whom
he
loved
was
his
companion
and
his
nurse
and
so
dear
had
the
quiet
scene
of
their
happiness
become
to
them
that
forgetful
there
was
still
a
danger
of
their
being
discovered
it
was
with
considerable
regret
that
they
received
a
summons
to
embark
and
saw
themselves
on
their
voyage
to
portugal
but
before
she
left
england
adeline
wrote
to
her
mother
after
a
pleasant
and
short
voyage
the
lovers
found
themselves
at
lisbon
and
glenmurray
pursuant
to
his
resolution
immediately
proposed
to
adeline
to
unite
himself
to
her
by
the
indissoluble
ties
of
marriage
nothing
could
exceed
adeline
surprise
at
this
proposal
at
first
she
could
not
believe
glenmurray
was
in
earnest
but
seeing
that
he
looked
not
only
grave
but
anxious
and
as
if
earnestly
expecting
an
answer
she
asked
him
whether
he
had
convinced
himself
that
what
he
had
written
against
marriage
was
a
tissue
of
mischievous
absurdity
glenmurray
blushing
with
the
conceit
of
an
author
replied
he
still
thought
his
arguments
unanswerable
if
you
still
are
convinced
your
theory
is
good
why
let
your
practice
be
bad
it
is
incumbent
on
you
to
act
up
to
the
principles
that
you
profess
in
order
to
give
them
their
proper
weight
in
society
else
you
give
the
lie
to
your
own
declarations
it
is
better
for
me
to
do
that
than
for
you
to
be
the
sacrifice
to
my
reputation
replied
adeline
entirely
out
of
the
question
you
are
to
be
governed
by
no
other
law
but
your
desire
to
promote
general
utility
and
are
not
to
think
at
all
of
the
interest
of
an
individual
can
i
do
so
when
that
individual
is
dearer
to
me
than
all
the
world
beside
cried
glenmurray
passionately
if
you
but
once
recollect
that
you
are
dearer
to
me
than
all
the
world
beside
you
will
cease
to
suppose
that
my
happiness
can
be
affected
by
the
opinion
entertained
of
my
conduct
by
others
as
adeline
said
this
she
twisted
both
her
hands
in
his
arms
so
affectionately
and
looked
up
in
his
face
with
so
satisfied
and
tender
an
expression
that
glenmurray
could
not
bear
to
go
on
with
a
subject
which
evidently
drew
a
cloud
across
her
brow
and
hours
days
weeks
and
months
passed
rapidly
over
their
heads
before
he
had
resolution
to
renew
it
hours
days
weeks
and
months
spent
in
a
manner
most
dear
to
the
heart
and
most
salutary
to
the
mind
of
adeline
her
taste
for
books
which
had
hitherto
been
cultivated
in
a
partial
manner
and
had
led
her
to
one
range
of
study
only
was
now
directed
by
glenmurray
to
the
perusal
of
general
literature
and
the
historian
the
biographer
the
poet
and
the
novelist
obtained
alternately
her
attention
and
her
praises
in
her
knowledge
of
the
french
and
italian
languages
too
she
was
now
considerably
improved
by
the
instructions
of
her
lover
and
while
his
occasional
illnesses
were
alleviated
by
her
ever
watchful
attentions
their
attachment
was
cemented
by
one
of
the
strongest
of
all
ties
the
consciousness
of
mutual
benefit
and
assistance
chapter
xi
one
evening
as
they
were
sitting
on
a
bench
in
one
of
the
public
walks
a
gentleman
approached
them
whose
appearance
bespoke
him
to
be
an
englishman
though
his
complexion
showed
that
he
had
been
for
years
exposed
to
a
more
ardent
climate
than
that
of
britain
as
he
came
nearer
glenmurray
thought
his
features
were
familiar
to
him
and
the
stranger
starting
with
joyful
surprise
seized
his
hand
and
welcomed
him
as
an
old
friend
glenmurray
returned
his
salutation
with
great
cordiality
and
recognized
in
the
stranger
a
mr
maynard
an
amiable
man
who
had
gone
to
seek
his
fortune
in
india
and
was
returned
a
nabob
but
with
an
irreproachable
character
then
cried
mr
maynard
gaily
is
the
elegant
young
english
couple
that
my
servant
and
even
the
himself
was
so
loud
in
praise
of
little
did
i
think
the
happy
man
was
my
old
friend
though
no
man
is
more
deserving
of
being
happy
but
i
beg
you
will
introduce
me
to
your
lady
glenmurray
though
conscious
of
the
mistake
he
was
under
had
not
resolution
enough
to
avow
that
he
was
not
married
and
adeline
unaware
of
the
difficulty
of
glenmurray
situation
received
mr
salutation
with
the
utmost
ease
though
the
tremor
of
her
lover
voice
and
the
blush
on
his
cheek
as
he
said
give
me
leave
to
introduce
to
you
mr
maynard
an
old
friend
of
mine
were
sufficient
indications
that
the
rencontre
disturbed
him
in
a
few
minutes
adeline
and
mr
maynard
were
no
longer
strangers
mr
maynard
who
had
not
lived
much
in
the
society
of
women
and
not
at
all
in
that
of
women
accustomed
to
original
thinking
was
at
once
astonished
and
delighted
at
the
variety
of
adeline
remarks
at
the
playfulness
of
her
imagination
and
the
eloquence
of
her
expressions
but
it
was
very
evident
at
length
to
mr
maynard
that
in
proportion
as
adeline
and
he
became
more
acquainted
and
more
satisfied
with
each
other
glenmurray
grew
more
silent
and
more
uneasy
the
consequence
was
unavoidable
as
most
men
would
have
done
on
a
like
occasion
mr
maynard
thought
glenmurray
was
jealous
of
him
but
no
thought
so
vexatious
to
himself
and
so
degrading
to
adeline
had
entered
the
confiding
and
discriminating
mind
of
glenmurray
the
truth
was
he
knew
that
mr
maynard
whom
he
had
seen
in
the
walks
though
he
had
not
known
him
again
had
ladies
of
his
party
and
he
expected
that
the
more
mr
maynard
admired
his
supposed
wife
the
more
would
he
be
eager
to
introduce
her
to
his
companions
nor
was
glenmurray
wrong
in
his
conjectures
have
two
sisters
with
me
madam
said
mr
maynard
i
shall
be
happy
and
proud
to
introduce
to
you
one
of
them
is
a
widow
and
has
lived
several
years
in
india
but
returned
with
me
in
delicate
health
and
was
ordered
hither
she
is
not
a
woman
of
great
reading
but
has
an
excellent
understanding
and
will
admire
you
the
other
is
several
years
younger
and
i
am
sure
she
would
be
happy
in
an
opportunity
of
profiting
by
the
conversation
of
a
lady
who
though
not
older
than
herself
seems
to
have
had
so
many
more
opportunities
of
improvement
adeline
bowed
and
expressed
her
impatience
to
form
this
new
acquaintance
and
looked
triumphantly
at
glenmurray
meaning
to
express
spite
of
the
supposed
prejudices
of
the
world
here
is
a
man
who
wants
to
introduce
me
to
his
sisters
little
did
she
know
that
maynard
concluded
she
was
a
wife
his
absence
from
england
had
made
him
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
glenmurray
works
or
even
that
he
was
an
author
so
that
he
was
not
at
all
likely
to
suppose
that
the
moral
pious
youth
whom
he
had
always
respected
was
become
a
visionary
philosopher
and
in
defiance
of
the
laws
of
society
was
living
openly
with
a
mistress
my
sister
will
wonder
what
is
become
of
me
suddenly
cried
maynard
as
emily
is
so
unwell
as
to
keep
her
room
i
must
not
make
her
anxious
but
for
her
illness
i
should
have
requested
your
company
to
supper
i
should
have
liked
to
accept
the
invitation
replied
adeline
i
will
hope
to
see
the
ladies
soon
without
fail
cried
maynard
emily
be
not
well
enough
to
call
on
you
perhaps
you
will
come
to
her
apartments
expect
me
at
twelve
maynard
then
shook
his
grave
and
silent
friend
by
the
hand
and
departed
his
vanity
not
a
little
flattered
by
the
supposed
jealousy
of
glenmurray
now
said
adeline
when
he
was
out
of
hearing
hope
some
of
your
tender
fears
are
done
away
you
see
there
are
liberal
and
unprejudiced
persons
in
the
world
and
mr
maynard
instead
of
shunning
me
courts
my
acquaintance
for
his
sisters
glenmurray
shook
his
head
and
remained
silent
and
adeline
was
distressed
to
feel
by
his
burning
hand
that
he
was
seriously
uneasy
shall
certainly
call
on
these
ladies
continued
adeline
really
pine
for
the
society
of
amiable
women
glenmurray
sighed
deeply
he
dreaded
to
tell
her
that
he
could
not
allow
her
to
call
on
them
and
yet
he
knew
that
this
painful
task
awaited
him
besides
she
wished
she
said
to
know
some
amiable
women
and
eager
as
he
was
to
indulge
all
her
wishes
he
felt
but
too
certainly
that
in
this
wish
she
could
never
be
indulged
even
had
he
been
capable
of
doing
so
dishonourable
an
action
as
introducing
his
mistress
as
his
wife
he
was
sure
that
adeline
would
have
spurned
at
the
deception
and
silent
and
sad
he
grasped
adeline
hand
as
her
arm
rested
within
his
and
complaining
of
indisposition
slowly
returned
to
the
inn
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
adeline
again
expressed
her
eagerness
to
form
an
acquaintance
with
the
sisters
of
mr
maynard
when
glenmurray
starting
from
his
seat
paced
the
room
in
considerable
agitation
is
the
matter
cried
adeline
hastily
rising
and
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
glenmurray
grasped
her
hand
and
replied
with
assumed
firmness
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
form
an
acquaintance
with
mr
maynard
sisters
propriety
and
honour
both
forbid
me
to
allow
it
exclaimed
adeline
they
not
as
amiable
then
as
he
described
them
are
they
improper
acquaintances
for
me
well
then
i
am
disappointed
but
you
are
the
best
judge
of
what
is
right
and
i
am
contented
to
obey
you
the
simple
ingenuous
and
acquiescent
sweetness
with
which
she
said
this
was
a
new
pang
to
her
lover
had
she
repined
had
she
looked
his
task
would
not
have
been
so
difficult
what
reason
can
you
give
for
declining
this
acquaintance
resumed
adeline
there
the
difficulty
replied
glenmurray
and
amiable
as
i
know
you
to
be
how
can
i
bear
to
tell
these
children
of
prejudice
that
you
are
not
my
wife
but
my
mistress
adeline
started
and
turning
pale
exclaimed
you
sure
then
that
they
do
not
know
it
already
sure
else
maynard
would
not
have
thought
you
a
fit
companion
for
his
sisters
surely
he
must
know
your
principles
he
must
have
read
your
works
am
certain
he
is
ignorant
of
both
and
does
not
even
know
that
i
am
an
author
it
possible
cried
adeline
there
any
one
so
unfortunate
to
be
unacquainted
with
your
writings
glenmurray
at
another
time
would
have
been
elated
at
a
compliment
like
this
from
the
woman
whom
he
idolized
but
at
this
moment
he
heard
it
with
a
feeling
of
pain
which
he
would
not
have
liked
to
define
to
himself
and
casting
his
eyes
to
the
ground
he
said
nothing
then
said
adeline
mournfully
am
an
improper
companion
for
them
not
they
for
me
and
spite
of
herself
her
eyes
filled
with
at
this
moment
a
waiter
brought
in
a
note
for
glenmurray
it
was
from
maynard
and
as
follows
my
dear
friend
emily
is
better
and
both
my
sisters
are
so
impatient
to
see
and
know
your
charming
wife
that
they
beg
me
to
present
their
compliments
to
mrs
glenmurray
and
you
and
request
the
honour
of
your
company
to
a
late
breakfast
at
eleven
we
hope
to
see
you
ever
yours
will
send
an
answer
said
glenmurray
but
the
waiter
had
been
gone
some
minutes
before
either
adeline
or
glenmurray
spoke
at
length
adeline
struggling
with
her
feelings
observed
maynard
seems
so
amiable
a
man
that
i
should
think
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
convince
him
of
his
errors
surely
therefore
it
is
your
duty
to
call
on
him
state
our
real
situation
and
our
reasons
for
it
and
endeavour
to
convince
him
that
our
attachment
is
sanctioned
both
by
reason
and
virtue
not
by
the
church
replied
glenmurray
maynard
is
of
the
old
school
besides
a
man
of
is
not
likely
to
be
convinced
by
the
arguments
of
a
young
man
of
and
the
example
of
a
girl
of
nineteen
age
be
necessary
to
give
weight
to
arguments
returned
adeline
wonder
that
you
thought
proper
to
publish
four
years
ago
to
god
i
never
had
published
exclaimed
glenmurray
almost
pettishly
you
had
not
i
probably
should
never
have
been
yours
replied
adeline
fondly
leaning
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
then
looking
up
in
his
face
glenmurray
clasped
her
to
his
bosom
but
again
the
pleasure
was
mixed
with
pain
this
time
rejoined
adeline
friends
are
expecting
an
answer
you
had
better
carry
it
in
person
can
not
replied
glenmurray
there
is
only
one
way
of
getting
out
of
this
business
to
my
satisfaction
it
and
rest
assured
that
i
shall
approve
it
i
wish
to
order
horses
immediately
and
set
off
on
our
road
to
france
soon
though
the
air
agrees
with
you
so
well
yes
for
when
the
mind
is
uneasy
no
air
can
be
of
use
to
the
body
why
is
your
mind
uneasy
i
should
be
exposed
to
see
maynard
and
and
he
would
see
you
too
what
then
then
why
i
could
not
bear
to
see
him
look
on
you
with
an
eye
of
disrespect
wherefore
should
he
adeline
the
name
of
wife
imposes
restraint
even
on
a
libertine
but
that
of
mistress
mr
maynard
a
libertine
said
adeline
gravely
and
glenmurray
afraid
of
wounding
her
feelings
by
entering
into
a
further
explanation
changed
the
subject
and
again
requested
her
consent
to
leave
lisbon
have
often
told
you
said
adeline
sighing
my
will
is
yours
and
if
you
will
give
strict
orders
to
have
letters
sent
after
us
to
the
towns
that
we
shall
stop
at
i
am
ready
to
set
off
immediately
glenmurray
then
gave
his
orders
wrote
a
letter
explaining
his
situation
to
maynard
and
in
an
hour
they
were
on
their
journey
to
france
chapter
xii
in
the
meanwhile
mr
maynard
miss
maynard
and
mrs
wallington
his
widowed
sister
were
impatiently
expecting
glenmurray
answer
and
earnestly
hoping
to
see
him
and
his
lovely
companion
but
from
different
motives
maynard
was
impatient
to
see
adeline
because
he
really
admired
her
his
sisters
because
they
hoped
to
find
her
unworthy
of
such
violent
admiration
their
vanity
had
been
piqued
and
their
envy
excited
by
the
extravagant
praises
of
their
brother
and
they
had
interrupted
him
by
the
first
questions
which
all
women
ask
on
such
occasions
she
pretty
and
he
answered
pretty
she
tall
tall
taller
than
i
am
hate
tall
women
replied
miss
maynard
a
little
round
girl
of
nineteen
she
fair
fair
like
brown
women
cried
the
widow
people
always
look
silly
mrs
glenmurray
eyes
are
hazel
and
her
eyelashes
long
and
dark
eyes
are
always
cried
miss
maynard
mrs
glenmurray
for
her
expression
is
the
most
pure
and
ingenuous
that
i
ever
saw
some
girls
indecent
in
their
dress
and
very
licentious
in
their
manner
passed
us
as
we
sat
on
the
walk
and
the
comments
which
i
made
on
them
provoked
from
mrs
glenmurray
some
remarks
on
the
behaviour
and
dress
of
women
and
as
she
commented
on
the
disgusting
expression
of
vice
in
women
and
the
charm
of
modest
dignity
both
in
dress
and
manners
her
own
dress
manners
and
expression
were
such
an
admirable
comment
on
her
words
and
she
shone
so
brightly
if
i
may
use
the
expression
in
the
graceful
awfulness
of
virtue
that
i
gazed
with
delight
and
somewhat
of
apprehension
lest
this
fair
perfection
should
suddenly
take
flight
to
her
native
skies
toward
which
her
fine
eyes
were
occasionally
turned
me
if
our
brother
is
not
quite
poetical
this
prodigy
has
inspired
him
replied
the
widow
with
a
sneer
my
part
i
hate
prodigies
said
miss
maynard
feel
myself
unworthy
to
associate
with
them
when
one
woman
calls
another
a
prodigy
and
expresses
herself
as
unworthy
to
associate
with
her
it
is
very
certain
that
she
means
to
insult
rather
than
compliment
her
and
in
this
sense
mr
maynard
understood
his
sister
words
therefore
after
having
listened
with
tolerable
patience
to
a
few
more
sneers
at
the
unconscious
adeline
he
was
provoked
to
say
that
as
he
found
they
were
toward
his
new
acquaintance
he
hoped
that
when
they
became
acquainted
with
her
they
would
still
give
him
reason
to
say
as
he
always
had
done
that
he
was
proud
of
his
sisters
for
in
his
opinion
no
woman
ever
looked
so
lovely
as
when
she
was
doing
justice
to
the
merits
and
extenuating
the
faults
of
a
rival
rival
exclaimed
the
sisters
at
once
pray
what
rivalship
could
there
be
in
this
case
remark
was
a
general
one
but
since
you
choose
to
make
it
a
particular
one
i
will
answer
to
it
as
such
continued
mr
maynard
women
are
rivals
in
one
sense
rivals
for
general
esteem
and
admiration
and
she
only
shall
have
my
suffrage
in
her
favour
who
can
point
out
a
beauty
or
a
merit
in
another
woman
without
insinuating
at
the
same
time
a
counterbalancing
effect
mrs
glenmurray
it
seems
has
no
defects
least
i
have
not
known
her
long
enough
to
find
them
out
but
you
no
doubt
will
when
you
know
her
very
readily
spare
me
that
trouble
how
injudiciously
had
maynard
prepared
the
minds
of
his
sisters
to
admire
adeline
it
was
a
preparation
to
make
them
hate
her
and
they
were
very
impatient
to
begin
the
task
of
depreciating
both
her
and
her
when
glenmurray
note
arrived
is
not
glenmurray
hand
said
maynard
indeed
from
agitation
of
mind
the
writing
was
not
recognizable
must
be
hers
then
continued
he
affecting
to
kiss
the
address
with
rapture
is
the
hand
of
a
sloven
observed
mrs
wallington
studying
the
writing
in
dress
she
is
as
neat
as
a
quaker
retorted
the
brother
eagerly
snatching
the
letter
back
her
mind
seems
as
pure
as
her
dress
he
then
broke
the
seal
and
read
out
what
follows
maynard
you
receive
this
adeline
and
i
shall
be
on
our
road
to
france
and
you
start
not
are
the
occasion
of
our
abrupt
departure
so
jealous
indeed
said
maynard
to
himself
and
more
impressed
than
ever
with
the
charms
of
adeline
for
he
concluded
that
glenmurray
had
discovered
in
her
an
answering
prepossession
the
occasion
brother
cried
both
sisters
patience
saw
adeline
you
admired
her
and
wished
to
introduce
her
to
your
sisters
this
honour
forbad
me
to
allow
the
sisters
started
from
their
seats
adeline
is
not
my
wife
but
my
companion
here
maynard
made
a
full
pause
at
once
surprised
and
confounded
his
sisters
pleased
as
well
as
astonished
looked
triumphantly
at
each
other
and
mrs
wallington
exclaimed
then
this
angel
of
purity
turns
out
to
be
a
kept
lady
at
this
remark
miss
maynard
laughed
heartily
but
maynard
to
hide
his
confusion
commanded
silence
and
went
on
with
the
letter
spite
of
her
situation
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
you
believe
me
no
wife
was
ever
more
pure
than
adeline
at
this
passage
the
sisters
could
no
longer
contain
themselves
and
they
gave
way
to
loud
bursts
of
laughter
which
maynard
could
hardly
help
joining
in
but
being
angry
at
the
same
time
he
uttered
nothing
but
an
oath
which
i
shall
not
repeat
and
retreated
to
his
chamber
to
finish
the
letter
alone
during
his
absence
the
laughters
redoubled
but
in
the
midst
of
it
maynard
and
desired
they
would
allow
him
to
read
the
letter
to
the
end
the
sisters
immediately
begged
that
he
would
proceed
as
it
was
so
amusing
that
they
wished
to
hear
glenmurray
continued
thus
have
no
doubt
yet
to
learn
that
some
few
years
ago
i
commenced
author
and
published
opinions
contrary
to
the
established
usage
of
society
amongst
other
things
i
proved
the
absurdity
of
the
institution
of
marriage
and
adeline
who
at
an
early
age
read
my
works
became
one
of
my
converts
man
is
certainly
mad
cried
maynard
how
dreadful
it
is
that
this
angelic
creature
should
have
been
his
victim
perhaps
this
angel
brother
for
such
you
will
allow
she
is
spite
of
her
was
as
wicked
as
he
i
know
people
in
general
only
blame
the
seducer
but
i
always
blame
the
seduced
equally
do
not
doubt
it
said
her
brother
sneeringly
and
going
on
with
the
letter
wonder
then
that
being
forced
to
fly
from
her
maternal
roof
she
took
refuge
in
my
arms
dog
though
adeline
was
the
victim
neither
of
her
own
weakness
nor
of
my
seductions
but
was
merely
urged
by
circumstances
to
act
up
to
the
principles
which
she
openly
professed
i
felt
so
conscious
that
she
would
be
degraded
in
your
eyes
after
you
were
acquainted
with
her
situation
though
in
mine
she
appears
as
spotless
as
ever
that
i
could
not
bear
to
expose
her
even
to
a
glance
from
you
less
respectful
than
those
with
which
you
beheld
her
last
night
i
therefore
prevailed
on
her
to
leave
lisbon
nor
had
i
any
difficulty
in
so
doing
when
she
found
that
your
wish
of
introducing
her
to
your
sisters
was
founded
on
your
supposition
of
her
being
my
wife
and
that
all
chance
of
your
desiring
her
acquaintance
for
them
would
be
over
when
you
knew
the
nature
of
her
connexion
with
me
i
shall
now
bid
you
farewell
i
write
in
haste
and
agitation
and
have
not
time
to
say
more
than
god
bless
you
yes
i
see
how
it
is
muttered
mr
maynard
to
himself
when
he
had
finished
the
letter
was
jealous
of
me
i
wish
raising
his
voice
that
he
had
not
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
go
away
brother
replied
mrs
wallington
be
sure
you
would
not
have
introduced
us
to
this
piece
of
angelic
purity
a
little
the
worse
for
the
wear
replied
he
i
might
have
enjoyed
her
company
myself
perhaps
brother
you
might
have
rivalled
the
philosophic
author
in
time
observed
miss
maynard
i
had
not
it
would
have
been
from
no
want
of
good
will
on
my
part
returned
maynard
then
i
rejoice
that
the
creature
is
gone
replied
mrs
wallington
drawing
up
i
too
said
miss
maynard
disdainfully
i
think
we
had
better
drop
this
subject
i
have
had
quite
enough
of
it
so
have
i
cried
mrs
wallington
i
must
observe
before
we
drop
it
entirely
that
when
next
my
brother
comes
home
and
wearies
his
sisters
by
exaggerated
praises
of
another
woman
i
hope
he
will
take
care
that
his
goddess
or
rather
his
angel
of
purity
does
not
turn
out
to
be
a
kept
mistress
so
saying
she
left
the
room
and
miss
maynard
tittering
followed
her
while
maynard
too
sore
on
this
subject
to
bear
to
be
laughed
at
took
his
hat
in
a
pet
and
flinging
the
door
after
him
with
great
violence
walked
out
to
muse
on
the
erring
but
interesting
companion
of
glenmurray
chapter
xiii
while
these
conversations
were
passing
at
lisbon
glenmurray
and
adeline
were
pursuing
their
journey
to
france
and
insensibly
did
the
charm
of
being
together
obliterate
from
the
minds
of
each
the
rencontre
which
had
so
much
disturbed
them
but
adeline
began
to
be
uneasy
on
a
subject
of
much
greater
importance
she
every
day
expected
an
answer
from
her
mother
but
no
answer
arrived
and
they
had
been
stationary
at
perpignan
some
days
to
which
place
they
had
desired
their
letters
to
be
addressed
and
still
none
were
forwarded
thither
from
lisbon
the
idea
that
her
mother
had
utterly
renounced
her
now
took
possession
of
her
imagination
and
love
had
no
charm
to
offer
her
capable
of
affording
her
consolation
the
care
which
she
had
taken
of
her
infancy
the
affectionate
attentions
that
had
preserved
her
life
and
the
uninterrupted
kindness
which
she
had
shown
towards
her
till
her
attachment
to
sir
patrick
took
place
all
these
pressed
powerfully
and
painfully
on
her
memory
till
her
elopement
seemed
wholly
unjustifiable
in
her
eyes
and
she
reprobated
her
conduct
in
terms
of
the
most
bitter
at
these
moments
even
glenmurray
seemed
to
become
the
object
of
her
aversion
her
mother
had
forbidden
her
to
think
of
him
yet
to
make
her
flight
more
agonizing
to
her
injured
parent
she
had
eloped
with
but
as
soon
as
ever
she
beheld
him
he
regained
his
wonted
influence
over
her
heart
and
her
became
less
poignant
she
became
sensible
that
sir
patrick
guilt
and
her
mother
imprudent
marriage
were
the
causes
of
her
own
fault
and
not
glenmurray
and
could
she
but
receive
a
letter
of
pardon
from
england
she
felt
that
her
conscience
would
again
be
at
peace
but
soon
an
idea
of
a
still
more
harassing
nature
succeeded
and
overwhelmed
her
perhaps
her
desertion
had
injured
her
mother
health
perhaps
she
was
too
ill
to
write
perhaps
she
was
dead
and
when
this
horrible
supposition
took
possession
of
her
mind
she
used
to
avoid
even
the
presence
of
her
lover
and
as
her
spirits
commonly
sunk
towards
evening
when
the
still
renewed
expectations
of
the
day
had
been
deceived
she
used
to
hasten
to
a
neighbouring
church
when
the
bell
called
to
vespers
and
prostrate
on
the
steps
of
the
altar
lift
up
her
soul
to
heaven
in
the
silent
breathings
of
penitence
and
prayer
having
thus
relieved
her
heart
she
returned
to
glenmurray
pensive
but
resigned
one
evening
after
she
had
unburthened
her
feelings
in
this
manner
glenmurray
prevailed
on
her
to
walk
with
him
to
a
public
promenade
and
being
tired
they
sat
down
on
a
bench
in
a
shady
part
of
the
mall
they
had
not
sat
long
before
a
gentleman
and
two
ladies
seated
themselves
beside
them
glenmurray
instantly
rose
up
to
depart
but
the
gentleman
also
rose
and
exclaimed
he
indeed
glenmurray
have
you
forgotten
your
old
friend
willie
douglas
glenmurray
pleased
to
see
a
friend
whom
he
had
once
so
highly
valued
returned
the
salutation
with
marked
cordiality
while
the
ladies
with
great
kindness
accosted
adeline
and
begged
she
would
allow
them
the
honour
of
her
acquaintance
taught
by
the
rencontre
at
lisbon
adeline
for
a
moment
felt
embarrassed
but
there
was
something
so
truly
benevolent
in
the
countenance
of
both
ladies
and
she
was
so
struck
by
the
extreme
beauty
of
the
younger
one
that
she
had
not
resolution
to
avoid
or
even
to
receive
their
advances
coldly
and
while
the
gentlemen
were
commenting
on
each
other
looks
and
in
an
instant
going
over
the
occurrences
of
past
years
the
ladies
pleased
with
each
other
had
entered
into
conversation
i
expected
to
see
you
and
your
lady
said
major
douglas
maynard
was
writing
to
me
from
lisbon
when
he
laid
by
his
pen
and
took
the
walk
in
which
he
met
you
and
on
his
return
he
filled
up
the
rest
of
his
letter
with
the
praises
of
mrs
glenmurray
and
expressions
of
envy
at
your
happiness
glenmurray
and
adeline
both
blushed
deeply
said
adeline
to
herself
will
be
another
letter
to
write
when
we
get
home
for
though
ingenuousness
was
one
of
her
most
striking
qualities
she
had
not
resolution
enough
to
tell
her
new
acquaintance
that
she
was
not
married
besides
she
flattered
herself
that
could
she
once
interest
these
charming
women
in
her
favour
they
would
not
refuse
her
their
society
even
when
they
knew
her
real
situation
for
she
thought
them
too
amiable
to
be
prejudiced
as
she
called
it
and
was
not
yet
aware
how
much
the
perfection
of
the
female
character
depends
on
respect
even
to
what
may
be
called
the
prejudices
of
others
the
day
began
to
close
in
but
major
douglas
though
glenmurray
was
too
uneasy
to
answer
him
except
by
monosyllables
would
not
hear
of
going
home
and
continued
to
talk
with
cheerfulness
and
interest
of
the
scenes
of
his
and
glenmurray
early
youth
he
too
was
ignorant
of
his
notoriety
as
an
author
he
had
lived
chiefly
at
his
estates
in
the
highlands
nor
would
he
have
left
them
but
because
he
was
advised
to
travel
for
his
health
and
the
lovely
creature
whom
he
had
married
as
well
as
his
only
sister
was
anxious
on
his
account
to
put
the
advice
in
execution
he
therefore
made
no
allusions
to
glenmurray
opinions
that
could
give
him
an
opportunity
of
explaining
his
real
situation
and
he
saw
with
confusion
that
every
moment
increased
the
intimacy
of
adeline
and
the
wife
and
sister
of
his
friend
at
length
his
feelings
operated
so
powerfully
on
his
weak
frame
that
a
sudden
faintness
seized
him
and
supported
by
adeline
and
the
major
and
followed
by
his
two
kind
companions
he
returned
to
the
inn
there
to
get
rid
of
the
douglases
and
avoid
the
inquiries
of
adeline
who
suspected
the
cause
of
his
illness
he
immediately
retired
to
bed
his
friends
also
returned
home
lamenting
the
apparently
declining
health
of
glenmurray
and
expatiating
with
delight
on
the
winning
graces
of
his
supposed
wife
for
these
ladies
were
of
a
different
class
of
women
to
the
sisters
of
mrs
douglas
was
so
confessedly
a
beauty
so
rich
in
acknowledged
attractions
that
she
could
afford
to
do
justice
to
the
attractions
of
another
and
miss
douglas
was
so
decidedly
devoid
of
all
pretensions
to
the
lovely
in
person
that
the
idea
of
competition
with
the
beautiful
never
entered
her
mind
and
she
was
always
eager
to
admire
what
she
knew
that
she
was
incapable
of
rivalling
unexposed
therefore
to
feel
those
petty
jealousies
those
paltry
competitions
which
injure
the
character
of
women
in
general
emma
douglas
mind
was
the
seat
of
benevolence
and
candour
as
was
her
beautiful
sister
from
a
different
cause
and
they
were
both
warmer
even
than
the
major
in
praise
of
adeline
but
a
second
letter
from
mr
maynard
awaited
major
douglas
at
the
inn
which
put
a
fatal
stop
to
their
at
having
met
glenmurray
and
his
companion
mr
maynard
full
of
glenmurray
letter
and
still
more
deeply
impressed
than
ever
with
the
image
of
adeline
could
not
forbear
writing
to
the
major
on
the
subject
giving
as
a
reason
that
he
wished
to
let
him
know
the
true
state
of
affairs
in
order
that
he
might
avoid
the
letter
came
too
late
i
have
seen
him
have
welcomed
him
as
a
friend
and
he
has
had
the
impudence
to
introduce
his
harlot
to
my
wife
and
sister
so
spoke
the
major
in
the
language
of
passion
and
passion
is
never
glenmurray
had
introduced
adeline
and
this
was
gently
hinted
by
the
kind
and
candid
emma
douglas
while
the
younger
and
more
inexperienced
wife
sat
silent
with
consternation
at
having
pressed
with
the
utmost
kindness
the
hand
of
a
kept
mistress
vain
were
the
representations
of
his
sister
to
sooth
the
wounded
pride
of
major
douglas
without
considering
the
difficulty
of
such
a
proceeding
he
insisted
upon
it
that
glenmurray
should
have
led
adeline
away
instantly
as
unworthy
to
breathe
the
same
air
with
his
wife
and
sister
find
by
that
letter
brother
said
miss
douglas
this
unhappy
adeline
is
still
an
object
of
respect
in
his
eyes
and
he
could
not
wound
her
feelings
so
publicly
especially
as
she
seems
to
be
more
than
vicious
she
spoke
in
the
major
was
a
soldier
and
so
delicate
in
his
ideas
of
the
honour
of
women
that
he
thought
his
wife
and
sister
polluted
from
having
though
unconsciously
associated
with
adeline
being
violently
irritated
therefore
at
the
supposed
insult
offered
him
by
glenmurray
he
left
the
room
and
having
dispatched
a
challenge
to
him
told
the
ladies
he
had
letters
to
write
to
england
till
arrived
then
after
having
settled
his
affairs
in
case
he
should
fall
in
the
conflict
he
sat
brooding
alone
over
the
insolence
of
his
former
friend
there
was
a
consciousness
too
which
aggravated
his
resentment
calumny
had
been
busy
with
his
reputation
and
though
he
deserved
it
not
had
once
branded
him
with
the
name
of
coward
besides
his
elder
sister
had
been
seduced
by
a
man
of
very
high
rank
and
was
then
living
with
him
as
his
mistress
made
still
more
susceptible
therefore
of
affront
by
this
distressing
consciousness
he
suspected
that
glenmurray
from
being
acquainted
with
these
circumstances
had
presumed
on
them
and
dared
to
take
a
liberty
with
him
situated
as
he
then
was
which
in
former
times
he
would
not
have
ventured
to
offer
as
adeline
and
glenmurray
were
both
retired
for
the
night
when
the
major
note
arrived
it
was
not
delivered
till
morning
nor
then
luckily
till
adeline
supposing
glenmurray
asleep
was
gone
to
take
her
usual
walk
to
the
glenmurray
little
aware
of
its
contents
opened
it
and
read
as
follows
your
conduct
in
introducing
your
mistress
to
my
wife
and
sister
i
demand
immediate
satisfaction
as
you
may
possibly
not
have
recovered
your
indisposition
of
last
night
and
i
wish
to
take
no
unfair
advantages
i
do
not
desire
you
to
meet
me
till
evening
but
at
six
a
mile
out
of
the
north
side
of
the
town
i
shall
expect
i
can
lend
you
pistols
if
you
have
none
is
only
one
step
to
be
taken
said
glenmurray
mentally
starting
up
and
dressing
himself
and
in
a
few
moments
he
was
at
major
lodgings
the
major
had
just
finished
dressing
when
glenmurray
was
announced
he
started
and
turned
pale
at
seeing
him
then
dismissing
his
servant
and
taking
up
his
hat
and
his
pistols
he
desired
glenmurray
to
walk
out
with
him
all
my
heart
replied
glenmurray
but
recollecting
himself
no
said
he
come
hither
now
merely
to
talk
to
you
and
if
after
what
has
passed
the
ladies
should
see
us
go
out
together
they
would
be
but
too
sure
of
what
was
going
to
happen
and
might
follow
us
then
sir
cried
the
major
had
better
separate
till
evening
shall
not
leave
you
major
douglas
replied
glenmurray
solemnly
harsh
things
you
may
say
or
do
till
i
have
made
you
listen
to
me
can
i
listen
to
you
when
nothing
you
can
say
can
be
a
justification
of
your
conduct
do
not
mean
to
offer
i
am
only
come
to
tell
you
my
story
with
that
of
my
companion
and
my
resolutions
in
consequence
of
my
situation
and
i
conjure
you
by
the
recollections
of
our
early
days
of
our
past
pleasures
and
fatigues
those
days
when
fatigue
itself
was
a
pleasure
and
i
was
not
the
weak
emaciated
being
that
i
am
now
unable
to
bear
exertion
and
overcome
even
to
female
weakness
by
agitation
of
mind
such
as
i
experienced
last
night
god
sake
sit
down
cried
the
major
glancing
his
eye
over
the
faded
form
of
glenmurray
sat
down
say
i
conjure
you
by
these
recollections
he
continued
hear
me
with
candour
and
patience
weakness
will
render
me
brief
here
he
paused
to
wipe
the
damps
from
his
forehead
and
douglas
in
a
voice
of
emotion
desired
him
to
say
whatever
he
chose
but
to
say
it
directly
will
replied
glenmurray
indeed
there
is
one
at
home
who
will
be
alarmed
at
my
absence
the
major
frowned
and
biting
his
lip
said
mr
glenmurray
in
his
usual
tone
glenmurray
obeyed
he
related
his
commencing
author
the
nature
of
his
works
his
acquaintance
with
adeline
its
consequences
her
marriage
sir
patrick
villany
adeline
elopement
her
refusal
to
marry
him
and
the
grounds
on
which
it
was
founded
now
cried
glenmurray
when
his
narration
was
ended
my
firm
resolve
let
the
consequences
to
my
reputation
be
what
they
may
let
your
insults
be
what
they
may
i
will
not
accept
your
challenge
i
will
not
expose
adeline
to
the
risk
of
being
left
without
a
protector
in
a
foreign
land
and
probably
without
one
in
her
own
i
fear
that
in
the
natural
course
of
things
i
shall
not
continue
with
her
long
but
while
i
can
watch
over
and
contribute
to
her
happiness
no
dread
of
shame
no
fear
for
what
others
may
think
of
me
no
selfish
consideration
whatever
shall
induce
me
to
hazard
a
life
which
belongs
to
her
and
on
which
at
present
her
happiness
depends
i
think
douglas
you
are
incapable
of
treating
me
with
dignity
but
even
to
that
i
will
patiently
submit
rather
than
expose
my
life
while
consoled
by
my
motive
i
will
triumphantly
exclaim
adeline
what
i
can
endure
for
thy
sake
here
he
paused
and
the
major
interested
and
affected
had
involuntarily
put
out
his
hand
to
him
but
drawing
it
back
he
said
i
may
be
sure
that
you
meant
no
affront
to
me
by
suffering
my
wife
and
sister
to
converse
with
miss
mowbray
glenmurray
having
put
an
end
to
these
suspicions
entirely
by
a
candid
avowal
of
his
feelings
and
of
his
wish
to
have
escaped
directly
if
possible
the
major
shook
him
affectionately
by
the
hand
and
told
him
that
though
he
firmly
believed
too
much
learning
had
made
him
mad
yet
that
he
was
as
much
his
friend
as
ever
what
vexes
me
is
said
he
you
should
have
turned
the
head
of
that
sweet
girl
the
opinion
of
the
world
is
every
thing
to
a
woman
it
is
indeed
replied
glenmurray
spite
of
ridicule
i
would
marry
adeline
directly
as
i
said
before
to
guaranty
her
against
reproach
i
wish
you
would
try
to
persuade
her
to
be
mine
legally
i
will
eagerly
replied
the
major
am
sure
i
shall
prevail
with
her
i
am
sure
i
shall
soon
convince
her
that
the
opinions
she
holds
are
nothing
but
nonsense
will
find
replied
glenmurray
blushing
her
arguments
are
unanswerable
notwithstanding
though
taken
from
the
cursed
books
you
mentioned
forget
that
i
wrote
these
books
i
did
and
i
wish
she
could
forget
it
also
and
then
they
would
appear
to
her
as
they
must
do
no
doubt
to
all
people
of
common
sense
and
that
is
abominable
stuff
glenmurray
bit
his
lips
but
the
author
did
not
long
absorb
the
lover
and
he
urged
the
major
to
return
with
him
to
his
lodgings
that
i
will
cried
he
what
is
more
my
sister
emma
who
writes
admirably
shall
write
her
a
letter
to
convince
her
that
she
had
better
be
married
directly
had
better
converse
with
her
said
glenmurray
the
major
looked
grave
and
observed
that
they
would
do
well
to
go
and
consult
the
women
on
the
subject
and
tell
them
the
whole
story
so
saying
he
opened
the
door
of
a
closet
leading
to
their
apartment
but
there
to
their
great
surprise
they
found
mrs
douglas
and
emma
and
as
well
informed
of
everything
as
themselves
for
expecting
that
a
duel
might
be
the
consequence
of
the
major
impetuosity
and
hearing
mr
glenmurray
announced
they
resolved
to
listen
to
the
conversation
and
if
it
took
the
turn
which
they
expected
to
rush
in
and
endeavour
to
mollify
the
disputants
ladies
this
is
very
pretty
indeed
i
protest
cried
major
douglas
but
he
said
no
more
for
his
wife
affected
by
the
recital
which
she
had
heard
and
delighted
to
find
that
there
would
be
no
duel
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
burst
into
tears
emma
almost
equally
affected
gave
her
hand
to
glenmurray
and
told
him
nothing
on
her
part
should
be
omitted
to
prevail
on
adeline
to
sacrifice
her
opinions
to
her
welfare
said
so
cried
the
major
will
write
to
her
i
will
see
her
and
argue
with
her
so
will
i
cried
the
wife
you
shall
not
bluntly
replied
the
major
not
i
think
it
my
duty
to
do
all
i
can
to
save
a
from
ruin
and
words
spoken
from
the
heart
are
always
more
powerful
than
words
written
what
will
the
world
say
if
i
permit
you
to
converse
with
a
kept
mistress
world
here
to
us
as
we
associate
with
none
and
are
known
to
none
is
mr
glenmurray
and
miss
mowbray
and
of
their
good
word
we
are
sure
cried
emma
sure
of
succeeding
with
this
interesting
adeline
too
for
if
she
likes
us
as
i
think
she
does
adores
you
replied
glenmurray
much
the
better
then
when
we
shall
tell
her
that
we
can
not
associate
with
her
much
as
we
admire
her
unless
she
consents
to
become
a
wife
surely
she
will
hear
reason
doubt
cried
mrs
douglas
then
we
will
go
to
church
with
her
and
you
emma
shall
be
bride
maid
see
no
necessity
for
that
observed
the
major
gravely
i
do
replied
emma
will
repeat
her
vows
with
more
heartfelt
reverence
when
two
respectable
women
deeply
impressed
themselves
with
their
importance
shall
be
there
to
witness
them
there
is
no
protestant
church
here
exclaimed
glenmurray
we
can
go
back
to
lisbon
and
you
are
already
resolved
to
return
thither
this
point
being
settled
it
was
agreed
that
glenmurray
should
prepare
adeline
for
their
visit
and
with
a
lightened
heart
he
went
to
execute
his
commission
but
when
he
saw
adeline
he
forgot
his
commission
and
every
thing
but
her
distress
for
he
found
her
with
an
open
letter
in
her
hand
and
an
unopened
one
on
the
floor
in
a
state
of
mind
almost
bordering
on
phrensy
chapter
xiv
as
soon
as
adeline
beheld
glenmurray
she
exclaimed
in
a
hoarse
and
agitated
tone
is
my
letter
to
my
mother
returned
unopened
and
here
is
a
letter
from
dr
norberry
which
has
broken
my
heart
however
we
must
go
to
england
directly
the
letter
was
as
follows
have
made
a
pretty
fool
of
me
deluded
but
still
dear
girl
for
you
have
made
me
believe
in
forebodings
you
may
remember
with
what
a
full
heart
i
bade
you
adieu
and
i
recollect
what
a
devilish
queer
sensation
i
had
when
the
closed
on
your
fleet
carriage
i
almost
swore
at
the
postillions
for
driving
so
fast
as
i
wished
to
see
you
as
long
as
i
could
and
now
i
protest
that
i
believe
i
was
actuated
by
a
foreboding
that
at
that
house
and
on
that
spot
i
should
never
behold
you
again
here
a
tear
had
fallen
on
the
paper
and
the
word
was
nearly
blotted
out
dear
lost
adeline
i
prayed
for
you
too
i
prayed
that
you
might
return
as
innocent
and
happy
as
you
left
me
heaven
have
mercy
on
us
who
should
have
thought
it
but
this
is
nothing
to
the
purpose
and
i
suppose
you
think
you
have
done
nought
but
what
is
right
and
clever
he
then
proceeded
to
inform
adeline
who
had
written
to
him
to
implore
his
mediation
between
her
and
her
mother
the
latter
had
sent
express
for
him
on
finding
by
the
hasty
scrawl
which
came
the
day
after
adeline
departure
from
the
that
she
had
eloped
and
who
was
the
companion
of
her
flight
that
he
found
her
in
violent
agitation
as
sir
patrick
stung
to
madness
at
the
success
of
his
rival
had
with
an
ingenuousness
worthy
a
better
cause
avowed
to
her
his
ardent
passion
for
her
daughter
his
resolution
to
follow
the
fugitives
and
by
every
means
possible
separate
adeline
from
her
lover
and
that
after
having
thanked
lady
for
her
great
generosity
to
him
he
had
taken
his
pistols
mounted
his
horse
attended
by
his
groom
also
well
armed
and
vowed
that
he
would
never
return
unless
accompanied
by
the
woman
whom
he
adored
wonder
therefore
continued
the
doctor
i
was
an
unsuccessful
advocate
for
you
especially
as
i
was
not
inclined
to
manage
the
old
bride
for
i
was
so
provoked
at
her
folly
in
marrying
the
handsome
profligate
that
if
she
had
not
been
in
distress
i
never
meant
to
see
her
again
but
poor
silly
you
she
suffers
enough
for
her
folly
and
so
do
you
for
her
affections
and
her
being
equally
wounded
by
sir
patrick
confession
you
are
at
present
the
object
of
her
aversion
to
you
she
attributes
all
the
misery
of
having
lost
the
man
on
whom
she
still
dotes
and
when
she
found
from
your
last
letter
to
me
that
you
are
not
the
wife
but
the
mistress
of
glenmurray
by
the
bye
your
letter
to
her
from
lisbon
she
desires
me
to
return
unopened
and
that
the
child
once
her
pride
is
become
her
disgrace
she
declared
her
solemn
resolution
never
to
see
you
more
and
to
renounce
you
for
ever
terrible
words
adeline
i
tremble
to
write
them
but
a
circumstance
has
since
occurred
which
gives
me
hopes
that
she
may
yet
forgive
and
receive
you
on
certain
conditions
about
a
fortnight
after
sir
patrick
departure
a
letter
from
ireland
directed
to
him
in
a
woman
hand
arrived
at
the
pavilion
your
mother
opened
it
and
found
it
was
from
a
wife
of
her
amiable
husband
whom
he
had
left
in
the
north
of
ireland
and
who
having
heard
of
his
second
marriage
wrote
to
tell
him
that
unless
he
came
quickly
back
to
her
she
would
prosecute
him
for
bigamy
as
he
knew
very
well
that
undoubted
proofs
of
the
marriage
were
in
her
possession
at
first
this
new
proof
of
her
beautiful
spouse
villany
drove
your
mother
almost
to
phrensy
and
i
was
again
sent
for
but
time
reflection
and
perhaps
my
arguments
convinced
her
that
to
be
able
to
free
herself
from
this
rascal
for
ever
and
consequently
her
fortune
losing
only
the
ten
thousand
pounds
which
she
had
given
him
to
pay
his
debts
was
in
reality
a
consoling
circumstance
accordingly
she
wrote
to
the
real
lady
promising
to
accede
quietly
to
her
claim
and
wishing
that
she
would
spare
her
and
herself
the
disgrace
of
a
public
trial
especially
as
it
must
end
in
the
conviction
of
sir
patrick
she
then
on
hearing
from
him
that
he
had
traced
you
to
falmouth
and
was
going
to
embark
for
lisbon
when
the
wind
was
favourable
enclosed
him
a
copy
of
his
wife
letter
and
bade
him
an
eternal
farewell
but
be
not
alarmed
lest
this
insane
profligate
should
overtake
and
distress
you
he
is
gone
to
his
final
account
in
his
hurry
to
get
on
board
overcome
as
he
was
with
the
great
quantity
of
liquor
which
he
had
drunk
to
banish
care
he
sprung
from
the
boat
before
it
was
near
enough
to
reach
the
vessel
his
foot
slipped
against
the
side
he
fell
into
the
water
and
going
under
the
ship
never
rose
again
i
leave
you
to
imagine
how
the
complicated
distresses
of
the
last
three
months
and
this
awful
climax
to
them
have
affected
your
mother
mind
even
i
can
not
scold
her
now
for
the
life
of
me
she
is
not
yet
i
believe
disposed
in
your
favour
but
were
you
here
and
were
you
to
meet
it
is
possible
that
forlorn
lonely
and
deserted
as
she
now
feels
the
tie
between
you
might
be
once
more
cemented
and
much
as
i
resent
your
conduct
you
may
depend
on
my
o
adeline
child
of
my
affection
why
must
i
blush
to
subscribe
myself
sincere
friend
words
can
not
describe
the
feelings
of
anguish
which
this
letter
excited
in
adeline
nor
could
she
make
known
her
sensations
otherwise
than
by
reiterated
requests
to
be
allowed
to
set
off
for
england
directly
requests
to
which
glenmurray
alarmed
for
her
intellects
immediately
assented
therefore
leaving
a
hasty
note
for
the
douglases
they
soon
bade
farewell
to
perpignan
and
after
a
long
laborious
journey
but
a
short
passage
they
landed
at
brighton
it
was
a
fine
evening
and
numbers
of
the
gay
and
fashionable
of
both
sexes
were
assembled
on
the
beach
to
see
the
passengers
land
adeline
and
glenmurray
were
amongst
the
first
and
while
heartsick
fatigued
and
melancholy
adeline
took
the
arm
of
her
lover
and
turned
disgusted
from
the
brilliant
groups
before
her
she
saw
walking
along
the
shore
dr
norberry
his
wife
and
his
two
daughters
instantly
unmindful
of
every
thing
but
the
delight
of
seeing
old
acquaintances
and
of
being
able
to
gain
some
immediate
tiding
of
her
mother
she
ran
up
to
them
and
just
as
they
turned
round
she
met
them
extending
her
hand
in
friendship
as
she
was
wont
to
but
in
vain
no
hand
was
stretched
out
to
meet
hers
nor
tongue
nor
look
proclaimed
a
welcome
to
her
dr
norberry
himself
coldly
touched
his
hat
and
passed
on
while
his
wife
and
daughters
looked
scornfully
at
her
and
without
deigning
to
notice
her
pursued
their
walk
astonished
and
confounded
adeline
had
not
power
to
articulate
a
word
and
had
not
glenmurray
caught
her
in
his
arms
she
would
have
fallen
to
the
ground
now
i
am
indeed
an
outcast
even
my
oldest
and
best
friend
renounces
me
she
exclaimed
i
am
left
to
you
cried
glenmurray
adeline
sighed
she
could
not
say
as
she
had
formerly
done
you
are
all
to
me
the
image
of
her
mother
happy
as
the
wife
of
a
man
she
loved
could
not
long
rival
glenmurray
but
the
image
of
her
mother
disgraced
and
wretched
awoke
all
the
habitual
but
dormant
tenderness
of
years
every
feeling
of
filial
gratitude
revived
in
all
its
force
and
even
while
leaning
on
the
shoulder
of
her
lover
she
sighed
to
be
once
more
clasped
to
the
bosom
of
her
mother
glenmurray
felt
the
change
but
though
grieved
was
not
offended
shall
die
in
peace
he
cried
i
can
but
see
you
restored
to
your
mother
affection
even
though
the
surrender
of
my
happiness
is
to
be
the
purchase
shall
die
in
peace
replied
adeline
shuddering
the
phrase
was
though
perhaps
undesignedly
so
adeline
clung
close
to
his
arm
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
all
the
way
to
the
inn
she
thought
only
of
glenmurray
with
an
apprehension
which
she
could
not
conquer
do
you
mean
to
do
now
said
glenmurray
to
dr
norberry
i
think
he
will
at
least
have
humanity
enough
to
let
me
know
where
to
find
my
mother
doubt
and
you
had
better
write
directly
adeline
took
up
her
pen
a
letter
was
written
and
as
quickly
torn
letter
succeeded
to
letter
but
not
one
of
them
answered
her
wishes
the
dark
hour
arrived
and
the
letter
remained
unwritten
is
too
soon
to
ring
for
candles
said
glenmurray
putting
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
leading
her
to
the
window
the
sun
was
below
the
horizon
but
the
reflection
of
his
beams
still
shone
beautifully
on
the
surrounding
objects
adeline
reclining
her
cheek
on
glenmurray
arm
gazed
in
silence
on
the
scene
before
her
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
a
gentleman
was
announced
it
was
now
so
dark
that
all
objects
were
indistinctly
seen
and
the
gentleman
had
advanced
close
to
adeline
before
she
knew
him
to
be
dr
norberry
and
before
she
could
decide
how
she
should
receive
him
she
felt
herself
clasped
to
his
bosom
with
the
affection
of
a
father
surprised
and
affected
she
could
not
speak
and
glenmurray
had
ordered
candles
before
adeline
had
recovered
herself
sufficiently
to
say
these
words
your
conduct
on
the
beach
i
little
expected
this
visit
replied
the
doctor
a
man
out
of
regard
to
society
has
performed
a
painful
task
surely
he
may
be
allowed
out
of
regard
to
himself
to
follow
the
dictates
of
his
i
obeyed
my
head
when
i
passed
you
so
cavalierly
and
i
thought
i
should
never
have
gone
through
my
task
as
i
did
but
then
for
the
sake
of
my
daughters
i
gave
a
gulp
and
called
up
a
fierce
look
but
i
told
madam
that
i
meant
to
call
on
you
and
she
insisted
very
properly
that
it
should
be
in
the
dark
hour
what
of
my
mother
is
a
miserable
woman
as
she
deserved
to
be
an
old
fool
do
not
call
her
so
to
hear
she
is
miserable
is
torment
sufficient
to
me
where
is
she
at
the
pavilion
but
she
is
going
to
let
rosevalley
retire
to
her
estate
in
cumberland
and
live
unknown
and
unseen
will
she
not
allow
me
to
live
with
her
as
mr
glenmurray
mistress
receive
under
her
roof
the
seducer
of
her
daughter
i
am
no
seducer
cried
adeline
became
the
mistress
of
mr
glenmurray
from
the
dictates
of
my
reason
not
my
weakness
or
his
persuasions
replied
the
doctor
should
expect
to
find
such
reason
in
moorfields
besides
had
not
mr
glenmurray
books
turned
your
head
you
would
not
have
thought
it
pretty
and
right
to
become
the
mistress
of
any
man
so
he
is
your
seducer
after
all
far
i
plead
guilty
replied
glenmurray
whatever
my
opinions
are
i
have
ever
been
willing
to
sacrifice
them
to
the
welfare
of
miss
mowbray
and
have
from
the
first
moment
that
we
were
safe
from
pursuit
been
urgent
to
marry
her
why
are
you
not
married
i
would
not
consent
said
adeline
coldly
certainly
mad
exclaimed
the
doctor
you
you
are
an
honest
fellow
after
all
turning
to
glenmurray
and
shaking
him
by
the
hand
of
the
head
not
bad
in
the
heart
burn
your
vile
books
and
i
am
your
friend
for
ever
will
discuss
that
point
another
time
replied
glenmurray
present
the
most
interesting
subject
to
us
is
the
question
whether
mrs
mowbray
will
forgive
her
daughter
or
not
man
if
i
may
judge
of
mrs
mowbray
by
myself
one
condition
of
her
forgiveness
will
be
your
marrying
her
daughter
blest
condition
cried
glenmurray
should
think
replied
adeline
coldly
mother
must
have
had
too
much
of
marriage
to
wish
me
to
marry
but
if
she
should
insist
on
my
marrying
i
will
comply
and
on
no
other
account
infatuation
to
me
appears
only
justice
and
duty
but
your
reasons
girl
your
reasons
are
few
but
strong
glenmurray
philanthropically
bent
on
improving
the
state
of
society
puts
forth
opinions
counteracting
its
received
usages
backed
by
arguments
which
are
in
my
opinion
incontrovertible
your
opinion
pray
child
how
old
are
you
at
that
age
you
set
up
for
a
reformer
well
go
on
though
it
be
important
to
the
success
of
his
opinions
and
indeed
to
the
respectability
of
his
character
that
he
should
act
according
to
his
precepts
he
for
the
sake
of
preserving
to
me
the
notice
of
persons
whose
narrowness
of
mind
i
despise
would
conform
to
an
institution
which
both
he
and
i
think
unworthy
of
regard
from
a
rational
and
shall
not
i
be
as
generous
as
he
is
shall
i
scruple
to
give
up
for
his
honour
and
fame
the
petty
advantages
which
marriage
would
give
me
never
his
honour
and
fame
are
too
dear
to
me
but
the
claims
which
my
mother
has
on
me
are
in
my
eyes
so
sacred
that
for
her
sake
though
not
for
my
own
i
would
accept
the
sacrifice
which
glenmurray
offers
if
then
she
says
that
she
will
never
see
or
pardon
me
till
i
am
become
a
wife
i
will
follow
him
to
the
altar
directly
but
till
then
i
must
insist
on
remaining
as
i
am
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
respect
the
man
i
love
and
i
should
not
respect
glenmurray
were
he
not
capable
of
supporting
with
fortitude
the
consequences
of
his
opinions
and
could
he
for
motives
less
strong
than
those
he
avows
cease
to
act
up
to
what
he
believes
to
be
right
for
never
can
i
respect
or
believe
firmly
in
the
truth
of
those
doctrines
the
followers
of
which
shrink
from
a
sort
of
martyrdom
in
support
of
them
mr
glenmurray
cried
the
doctor
shaking
his
head
have
you
to
answer
for
what
a
glorious
champion
would
that
creature
have
been
in
the
support
of
truth
when
even
error
in
her
looks
so
like
to
virtue
and
then
the
amiable
disinterestedness
of
you
both
what
a
powerful
thing
must
true
love
be
when
it
can
make
a
speculative
philosopher
indifferent
to
the
interests
of
his
system
and
ready
to
act
in
direct
opposition
to
it
rather
than
injure
the
respectability
of
the
woman
he
loves
well
well
the
lord
forgive
you
young
man
for
having
taken
it
into
your
head
to
set
up
for
a
great
author
glenmurray
answered
by
a
sigh
and
the
doctor
continued
there
is
that
girl
again
with
a
heart
so
fond
and
true
that
her
love
comes
in
aid
of
her
integrity
and
makes
her
think
no
sacrifice
too
great
in
order
to
prove
her
confidence
in
the
wisdom
of
her
lover
urging
her
to
disregard
all
personal
inconveniences
rather
than
let
him
forfeit
for
her
sake
his
pretensions
to
independence
and
consistency
of
character
girl
i
ca
help
admiring
you
but
no
more
i
could
a
malabar
widow
who
with
fond
and
pious
enthusiasm
from
an
idea
of
duty
throws
herself
on
the
funeral
pile
of
her
husband
but
still
i
should
think
you
a
great
fool
notwithstanding
for
professing
the
opinions
that
led
to
such
an
exertion
of
duty
and
now
here
are
you
possessed
of
every
quality
both
of
head
and
heart
to
bless
others
and
to
bless
yourself
owing
to
your
foolish
and
pernicious
opinions
here
you
are
i
say
blasted
in
reputation
in
the
prime
of
your
days
and
doomed
perhaps
to
pine
through
existence
in
pshaw
i
ca
support
the
idea
added
he
gulping
down
a
sob
as
he
spoke
and
traversing
the
room
in
great
emotion
adeline
and
glenmurray
were
both
of
them
deeply
and
painfully
affected
and
the
latter
was
going
to
express
what
he
felt
when
the
doctor
seizing
adeline
hand
affectionately
exclaimed
my
poor
child
i
will
see
your
mother
once
more
i
will
go
to
london
tomorrow
by
this
time
she
is
there
and
you
had
better
follow
me
you
will
hear
of
me
at
the
old
hummums
and
here
is
a
card
of
address
to
an
hotel
near
it
where
i
would
advise
you
to
take
up
your
abode
so
saying
he
shook
glenmurray
by
the
hand
when
starting
back
he
exclaimed
man
here
is
a
skin
like
fire
and
a
pulse
like
lightning
my
dear
fellow
you
must
take
care
of
yourself
adeline
burst
into
tears
doctor
i
am
only
nervous
what
i
suppose
you
think
you
understand
my
profession
better
than
i
do
but
do
cry
my
child
when
your
mind
is
easier
perhaps
he
will
do
very
well
and
as
one
thing
likely
to
give
him
immediate
ease
i
prescribe
a
visit
to
the
altar
of
the
next
parish
church
so
saying
he
departed
and
all
other
considerations
were
again
swallowed
up
in
adeline
mind
by
the
idea
of
glenmurray
danger
it
possible
that
my
marrying
you
would
have
such
a
blessed
effect
on
your
health
cried
adeline
after
a
pause
certainly
would
make
my
mind
easier
than
it
now
is
replied
he
i
thought
so
said
adeline
no
regard
for
my
supposed
interest
merely
makes
you
say
so
and
indeed
i
should
not
think
so
well
of
you
as
i
now
do
if
i
imagined
that
you
could
be
made
easy
by
an
action
by
which
you
forfeited
all
pretensions
to
that
consistency
of
character
so
requisite
to
the
true
dignity
of
a
philosopher
a
deep
sigh
from
glenmurray
in
answer
proved
that
he
was
no
philosopher
in
the
morning
the
lovers
set
off
for
london
dr
norberry
having
preceded
them
by
a
few
hours
this
blunt
but
benevolent
man
had
returned
the
evening
before
slowly
and
pensively
to
his
lodgings
his
heart
full
of
pity
for
the
errors
of
the
enthusiasts
whom
he
had
left
and
his
head
full
of
plans
for
their
assistance
or
rather
for
that
of
adeline
but
he
entered
his
own
doors
again
reluctantly
he
knew
but
too
well
that
no
sympathy
with
his
feelings
awaited
him
there
his
wife
a
woman
of
narrow
capacity
and
no
talents
or
accomplishments
had
like
all
women
of
that
sort
a
great
aversion
to
those
of
her
sex
who
united
to
feminine
graces
and
gentleness
the
charms
of
a
cultivated
understanding
and
pretensions
to
accomplishments
or
literature
of
mrs
mowbray
as
we
have
before
observed
she
had
always
been
peculiarly
jealous
because
dr
norberry
spoke
of
her
knowledge
with
wonder
and
of
her
understanding
with
admiration
not
that
he
entertained
one
moment
a
feeling
of
preference
towards
her
inconsistent
with
an
almost
idolatrous
love
of
his
wife
whose
skill
in
all
the
domestic
duties
and
whose
very
pretty
face
and
person
were
the
daily
themes
of
his
praise
but
mrs
norberry
wished
to
engross
all
his
panegyrics
to
herself
and
she
never
failed
to
expatiate
on
mrs
mowbray
foibles
and
flightiness
as
long
as
the
doctor
had
expatiated
on
her
charms
sometimes
indeed
this
last
subject
was
sooner
exhausted
than
the
one
which
she
had
chosen
but
when
adeline
grew
up
and
became
as
it
were
the
rival
of
her
daughters
in
the
praises
of
her
husband
she
found
it
difficult
as
we
have
said
before
to
bring
faults
in
array
against
excellencies
mrs
norberry
could
with
propriety
observe
when
the
doctor
was
exclaiming
a
charming
essay
mrs
mowbray
has
just
written
but
i
dare
say
she
ca
write
a
market
bill
when
he
said
well
she
comprehends
the
component
parts
of
the
animal
system
she
could
with
great
justice
reply
she
knows
nothing
of
the
component
parts
of
a
plum
pudding
but
when
adeline
became
the
object
of
the
husband
admiration
and
the
wife
enmity
mrs
norberry
could
not
make
these
pertinent
remarks
as
adeline
was
as
conversant
with
all
branches
of
housewifery
as
herself
and
though
as
learned
in
all
systems
as
her
mother
was
equally
learned
in
the
component
parts
of
puddings
and
pies
she
was
therefore
at
a
loss
what
to
say
when
adeline
was
praised
by
the
doctor
and
all
she
could
observe
on
the
occasion
was
that
the
girl
might
be
clever
but
was
certainly
very
ugly
very
affected
and
very
conceited
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
therefore
that
mrs
mowbray
degrading
and
unhappy
marriage
and
adeline
elopement
should
have
been
sources
of
triumph
to
mrs
norberry
and
her
daughters
who
though
they
liked
mrs
mowbray
very
well
could
not
bear
adeline
dr
norberry
these
are
your
uncommon
folks
exclaimed
mrs
norberry
on
hearing
of
the
marriage
and
of
the
subsequent
elopement
suppose
you
are
now
well
satisfied
at
not
having
a
genius
for
your
wife
or
geniuses
for
your
daughters
always
was
my
dear
meekly
replied
the
mortified
and
afflicted
doctor
and
dropped
the
subject
as
soon
as
possible
nor
had
it
been
resumed
for
some
time
when
adeline
accosted
them
on
the
beach
at
brighton
but
her
appearance
called
forth
their
dormant
enmity
and
the
whole
way
to
their
lodgings
the
good
doctor
heard
her
guilt
expatiated
upon
with
as
much
violence
as
ever
but
just
as
they
got
home
he
coldly
and
firmly
observed
shall
certainly
call
on
the
poor
deluded
girl
this
evening
and
mrs
norberry
knowing
by
the
tone
and
manner
in
which
he
spoke
that
this
was
a
point
which
he
would
not
give
up
contented
herself
with
requiring
only
that
he
should
go
in
the
dark
hour
chapter
xv
it
was
to
a
wife
and
daughters
such
as
these
that
he
was
returning
with
the
benevolent
wish
of
interesting
them
for
the
guilty
adeline
dr
norberry
you
are
come
back
at
last
was
his
first
salutation
what
does
the
creature
say
for
herself
creature
your
my
dear
says
very
little
grief
is
not
wordy
so
then
she
is
unhappy
is
she
cries
miss
norberry
am
monstrous
glad
of
it
the
doctor
started
and
an
oath
nearly
escaped
his
lips
he
did
say
zounds
jane
but
then
he
added
in
a
softer
tone
do
you
rejoice
in
a
poor
girl
affliction
i
think
it
is
for
the
good
of
her
soul
girl
replied
the
father
seizing
her
hand
may
your
soul
never
need
such
a
medicine
never
will
said
her
mother
proudly
has
been
differently
brought
up
has
been
well
brought
up
you
might
have
added
observed
the
doctor
modesty
permitted
it
mrs
mowbray
poor
woman
had
good
intentions
but
she
was
too
flighty
had
adeline
my
children
had
such
a
mother
as
yours
she
would
have
been
like
you
not
half
so
handsome
interrupted
the
mother
in
a
low
voice
as
our
faults
and
our
virtues
my
dear
depend
so
much
on
the
care
and
instruction
of
others
we
should
look
with
pity
as
well
as
aversion
on
the
faults
of
those
less
fortunate
in
instructors
than
we
have
been
very
true
said
mrs
norberry
flattered
and
affected
by
this
compliment
from
her
husband
you
know
james
norberry
laying
her
hand
on
his
always
told
you
you
overrated
mrs
mowbray
and
that
she
was
but
a
dawdle
after
all
always
did
my
good
woman
replied
he
raising
her
hand
to
his
lips
you
men
think
yourselves
much
wiser
than
we
are
do
so
replied
the
doctor
the
tone
was
equivocal
mrs
norberry
felt
it
to
be
so
and
looked
up
in
his
the
doctor
understood
the
look
it
was
one
of
doubt
and
inquiry
and
as
it
was
his
interest
to
sooth
her
in
order
to
carry
his
point
he
exclaimed
men
are
indeed
too
apt
to
pride
ourselves
in
our
supposed
superior
wisdom
but
i
you
will
own
my
dear
have
always
done
your
sex
justice
and
you
in
particular
have
been
a
good
husband
indeed
james
norberry
replied
his
wife
in
a
faltering
voice
i
believe
you
to
be
to
every
one
a
just
and
honourable
man
i
dare
say
dame
i
do
no
more
than
justice
to
you
when
i
think
you
will
approve
and
further
a
plan
for
adeline
mowbray
good
which
i
am
going
to
propose
to
you
mrs
norberry
withdrew
her
hand
but
returning
it
again
be
sure
my
dear
she
cried
thing
you
wish
that
is
if
i
see
right
to
will
explain
myself
continued
the
doctor
gently
have
promised
this
poor
girl
to
endeavour
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
between
her
and
her
mother
but
though
adeline
wishes
to
receive
her
pardon
on
any
terms
and
even
if
it
be
required
to
renounce
her
lover
i
fear
mrs
mowbray
is
too
much
incensed
against
her
to
see
or
forgive
her
woman
cried
mrs
norberry
indeed
cried
her
daughters
a
mother
ought
to
be
severe
very
severe
on
such
occasions
young
ladies
hastily
added
mrs
norberry
go
on
my
dear
it
is
but
too
probable
continued
the
doctor
glenmurray
will
not
live
long
and
then
this
young
creature
will
be
left
to
struggle
unprotected
with
the
difficulties
of
her
situation
and
who
knows
but
that
she
may
from
poverty
and
the
want
of
a
protector
be
tempted
to
continue
in
the
paths
of
vice
dr
norberry
and
what
then
who
or
what
is
to
prevent
it
you
know
we
have
three
children
to
provide
for
and
i
am
a
young
woman
as
yet
hannah
giving
her
a
kiss
a
very
pretty
woman
too
my
dear
love
anything
we
can
do
with
prudence
i
am
ready
to
do
i
can
say
no
more
have
said
enough
cried
the
doctor
exultingly
hear
my
plan
adeline
shall
in
the
event
of
glenmurray
death
which
though
not
certain
seems
likely
to
be
sure
i
did
not
inquire
into
the
nature
of
his
nocturnal
perspirations
his
expectoration
and
so
forth
papa
you
are
so
professional
affectedly
exclaimed
his
youngest
daughter
child
i
have
done
and
to
return
to
my
subject
if
glenmurray
lives
or
dies
i
think
it
advisable
that
adeline
should
go
into
retirement
to
and
where
can
she
be
better
than
in
my
little
cottage
now
empty
within
a
ride
of
our
house
if
she
wants
protection
i
can
protect
her
and
if
she
wants
money
before
her
mother
forgives
her
you
can
give
it
to
her
papa
cried
both
the
girls
shall
not
grudge
it
the
doctor
started
from
his
chair
and
embraced
his
daughters
with
joy
mixed
with
wonder
for
he
knew
they
had
always
disliked
true
but
then
she
was
prosperous
and
their
superior
little
minds
love
to
bestow
protection
and
it
was
easy
to
be
generous
to
the
fallen
adeline
mowbray
had
her
happiness
continued
so
would
their
hatred
it
is
a
settled
point
is
it
not
dame
asked
the
doctor
chucking
his
wife
under
the
chin
when
to
his
great
surprise
and
consternation
she
threw
his
hand
indignantly
from
her
and
vociferated
shall
never
live
within
a
ride
of
our
house
i
can
assure
you
dr
norberry
the
doctor
was
petrified
into
silence
and
the
girls
could
only
articulate
mamma
but
what
could
produce
this
sudden
and
violent
change
nothing
but
a
simple
and
natural
operation
of
the
human
mind
though
a
very
kind
husband
and
an
indulgent
father
dr
norberry
was
suspected
though
unjustly
of
being
a
very
gallant
man
and
some
of
mrs
norberry
friends
had
occasionally
hinted
to
her
their
sorrow
at
hearing
such
and
such
reports
reports
which
were
indeed
destitute
of
foundation
but
which
served
to
excite
suspicions
in
the
mind
of
the
tenacious
mrs
norberry
and
what
more
likely
to
them
than
the
young
and
frail
adeline
mowbray
living
in
a
cottage
of
her
husband
protected
supported
and
visited
by
him
the
moment
this
idea
occurred
its
influence
was
unconquerable
and
with
a
voice
and
manner
of
determined
hostility
she
made
known
her
resolves
in
consequence
of
it
after
a
pause
of
dismay
and
astonishment
the
doctor
cried
what
have
you
gotten
in
your
head
what
all
on
a
sudden
has
had
such
an
ugly
effect
on
you
thoughts
are
best
doctor
and
i
now
feel
that
it
would
be
highly
improper
for
you
with
daughters
grown
up
to
receive
with
such
marked
kindness
a
single
young
woman
at
a
cottage
of
yours
who
is
going
to
my
dear
it
is
a
different
case
when
i
do
it
to
keep
her
out
of
the
way
of
further
harm
is
more
than
i
know
dr
norberry
replied
the
wife
bridling
and
fanning
herself
whistled
the
doctor
and
then
addressing
his
daughters
you
had
better
go
to
bed
it
grows
late
the
young
ladies
obeyed
but
first
hung
round
their
mother
neck
as
they
bade
her
good
night
and
hoped
she
would
not
be
so
cruel
to
the
poor
deluded
adeline
mrs
norberry
angrily
shook
them
off
with
a
peevish
along
girls
the
doctor
cordially
kissed
and
bade
god
bless
them
while
the
door
closed
and
left
the
loving
couple
alone
what
passed
it
were
tedious
to
repeat
suffice
that
after
a
long
altercation
continued
even
after
they
were
retired
to
rest
the
doctor
found
his
wife
on
this
subject
incapable
of
listening
to
reason
and
that
as
a
finishing
stroke
she
exclaimed
does
not
signify
talking
dr
norberry
while
i
have
my
senses
and
can
see
into
a
a
little
the
hussey
shall
never
come
near
us
the
doctor
sighed
deeply
turned
himself
round
not
to
sleep
but
to
think
and
rose
the
next
morning
to
go
in
search
of
mrs
mowbray
dreading
the
interview
which
he
was
afterwards
to
have
with
adeline
for
he
did
not
expect
to
succeed
in
his
application
to
her
mother
and
he
could
not
now
soften
his
intelligence
with
a
as
he
intended
he
meant
to
have
said
to
her
mother
will
not
receive
you
but
if
you
ever
want
a
home
or
a
place
of
retirement
i
have
a
cottage
and
so
forth
cried
the
doctor
to
himself
as
these
thoughts
came
across
him
on
the
road
and
made
him
hastily
let
down
the
front
window
of
the
for
air
your
honour
speak
cries
the
i
but
ca
you
drive
faster
and
be
hanged
to
you
the
boy
whipped
his
the
doctor
then
found
that
it
was
up
hill
down
went
the
glass
again
you
brute
why
do
you
not
see
it
is
up
hill
for
find
fault
he
must
and
with
his
wife
he
could
not
or
dared
not
even
in
fancy
me
why
your
honour
bade
me
put
it
on
obedient
muttered
the
doctor
wish
every
one
was
like
you
in
that
respect
and
in
a
state
of
mind
not
the
pleasantest
possible
the
doctor
drove
into
town
and
to
the
hotel
where
mrs
mowbray
was
to
be
found
dr
norberry
was
certainly
now
not
in
a
humour
to
sooth
any
woman
whom
he
thought
in
the
wrong
except
his
wife
and
whether
from
carelessness
or
design
he
did
not
unfortunately
for
adeline
manage
the
of
her
unhappy
mother
he
found
mrs
mowbray
with
her
heart
shut
up
not
softened
by
sorrow
the
hands
once
stretched
forth
with
kindness
to
welcome
him
were
now
stiffly
laid
one
upon
the
other
and
are
you
sir
coldly
articulated
was
followed
by
as
cold
a
sit
down
how
ill
you
look
exclaimed
the
doctor
attend
more
to
my
feelings
than
my
looks
with
a
deep
sigh
answered
mrs
mowbray
feelings
are
as
bad
as
your
looks
i
dare
say
are
worse
sir
said
mrs
mowbray
piqued
was
no
need
of
that
replied
the
doctor
i
am
come
to
point
out
to
you
one
way
of
getting
rid
of
some
of
your
unpleasant
feelings
see
and
forgive
your
daughter
mrs
mowbray
started
changed
colour
and
exclaimed
with
quickness
she
in
england
but
added
instantly
have
no
daughter
she
who
was
my
child
is
my
most
inveterate
foe
she
has
involved
me
in
disgrace
and
misery
a
little
of
your
own
help
she
has
replied
the
doctor
come
my
old
friend
you
have
both
of
you
something
to
forget
and
forgive
and
the
sooner
you
set
about
it
the
better
now
do
write
and
tell
adeline
who
is
by
this
time
in
london
that
you
forgive
her
after
having
promised
me
not
to
hold
converse
with
that
villain
without
my
consent
had
i
no
other
cause
of
complaint
against
her
had
she
not
by
her
coquettish
arts
seduced
the
affections
of
the
man
i
loved
never
never
would
i
forgive
her
having
violated
the
sacred
promise
which
she
gave
me
promise
interrupted
the
doctor
she
would
never
have
violated
had
not
you
first
violated
that
sacred
compact
which
you
entered
into
at
her
birth
mean
you
sir
mean
that
though
a
parent
does
not
at
a
child
birth
solemnly
make
a
vow
to
do
all
in
his
or
her
power
to
promote
the
happiness
of
that
child
still
as
he
has
given
it
birth
he
has
tacitly
bound
himself
to
make
it
happy
this
tacit
agreement
you
broke
when
at
the
age
of
forty
you
regardless
of
your
daughter
welfare
played
the
fool
and
married
a
pennyless
profligate
merely
because
he
had
a
fine
person
and
a
handsome
leg
mrs
mowbray
was
too
angry
and
too
agitated
to
interrupt
him
and
he
went
on
what
was
the
consequence
the
young
fellow
very
naturally
preferred
the
daughter
to
the
mother
and
as
he
could
not
have
her
by
fair
was
resolved
to
have
her
by
foul
means
and
so
he
beg
dr
norberry
interrupted
mrs
mowbray
in
a
faint
voice
you
would
spare
the
disgusting
recital
well
i
will
now
do
consider
the
dilemma
your
child
was
in
she
must
either
elope
or
by
her
presence
keep
alive
a
criminal
passion
in
her
which
you
sooner
or
later
must
discover
and
be
besides
exposed
to
fresh
well
glenmurray
by
chance
happened
to
be
on
the
spot
just
as
she
escaped
from
that
villanous
clutches
and
is
dead
dr
norberry
interrupted
mrs
mowbray
you
know
the
old
adage
do
not
speak
ill
of
the
dead
a
very
silly
adage
it
is
i
had
rather
speak
ill
of
the
dead
than
the
living
for
my
part
but
let
me
go
well
love
taking
the
name
and
habit
of
prudence
and
filial
piety
for
she
thought
she
consulted
your
happiness
and
not
her
own
bade
her
fly
to
and
with
her
lover
and
now
there
she
is
owing
to
the
pretty
books
which
you
let
her
read
living
with
him
as
his
mistress
and
glorying
in
it
as
if
it
was
a
notable
praiseworthy
action
you
would
have
me
forgive
her
a
fault
which
both
your
precepts
and
conduct
occasioned
not
but
what
the
girl
has
been
wrong
terribly
wrong
no
one
ought
to
do
evil
that
good
may
come
you
had
forbidden
her
to
have
any
intercourse
with
glenmurray
and
she
therefore
knew
that
disobeying
you
would
make
you
unhappy
that
was
a
certainty
that
fellow
persevering
in
his
attempts
after
the
fine
rebuff
which
she
had
given
him
was
an
uncertainty
and
she
ought
to
have
run
the
risk
of
it
and
not
committed
a
positive
fault
to
avoid
a
possible
evil
but
then
hers
was
a
fault
which
she
could
not
have
committed
had
not
you
married
that
but
i
forbear
and
as
to
her
not
being
married
to
glenmurray
that
is
no
fault
of
his
and
with
your
consent
he
will
marry
your
daughter
morning
that
ever
so
good
a
youth
should
have
poked
his
nose
into
the
filthy
mess
of
eccentric
philosophy
you
done
doctor
cried
mrs
mowbray
haughtily
you
said
all
that
miss
mowbray
and
you
have
invented
to
insult
me
child
send
me
to
insult
you
she
adeline
why
the
poor
soul
came
and
post
haste
from
france
when
she
heard
of
your
misfortunes
to
offer
her
services
to
console
you
console
me
she
the
first
occasion
of
them
but
for
her
i
might
still
have
indulged
the
charming
delusion
even
if
it
were
delusion
that
love
of
me
not
of
my
wealth
induced
the
man
i
doted
upon
to
commit
a
crime
to
gain
possession
of
me
hastily
interrupted
the
doctor
saw
that
he
loved
her
long
before
he
married
you
the
storm
long
gathering
now
burst
forth
and
rising
with
the
tears
high
colour
and
vehement
voice
of
unbridled
passion
mrs
mowbray
exclaimed
raising
her
arm
and
clenching
her
fist
as
she
spoke
it
is
being
the
object
of
that
cruel
preference
which
i
never
never
will
forgive
her
the
doctor
after
ejaculating
as
much
as
to
say
murder
is
out
instantly
took
his
hat
and
departed
convinced
his
labour
was
vain
muttered
he
as
he
went
down
stairs
instances
in
one
day
ah
ah
that
jealousy
is
the
devil
he
then
slowly
walked
to
the
hotel
where
he
expected
to
find
adeline
and
glenmurray
they
had
arrived
about
two
hours
before
and
adeline
in
a
frame
of
mind
but
ill
fitted
to
bear
the
disappointment
which
awaited
her
for
with
the
sanguine
expectations
natural
to
her
age
she
had
been
as
usual
and
their
journey
to
london
had
been
rendered
a
very
short
one
by
the
delightful
plans
for
the
future
which
she
had
been
forming
and
imparting
to
glenmurray
i
consider
said
she
love
which
my
mother
has
always
shown
for
me
i
can
not
think
it
possible
that
she
can
persist
in
renouncing
me
and
however
her
respect
for
the
prejudices
of
the
world
a
world
which
she
intended
to
live
in
at
the
time
of
her
unfortunate
connexion
might
make
her
angry
at
my
acting
in
defiance
of
its
laws
now
that
she
herself
from
a
sense
of
injury
and
disgrace
is
about
to
retire
from
it
she
will
no
longer
have
a
motive
to
act
contrary
to
the
dictates
of
reason
herself
or
to
wish
me
to
do
so
your
ideas
of
reason
and
hers
may
be
so
different
our
practice
may
be
different
but
our
theory
is
the
same
and
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
my
mother
will
now
forgive
and
receive
us
and
that
living
in
a
romantic
solitude
being
the
whole
world
to
each
other
our
days
will
glide
away
in
uninterrupted
felicity
how
shall
we
employ
ourselves
said
glenmurray
smiling
shall
continue
to
write
for
the
instruction
of
your
while
my
mother
and
i
shall
be
employed
in
endeavouring
to
improve
the
situation
of
the
poor
around
us
and
perhaps
in
educating
our
children
adeline
when
animated
by
any
prospect
of
happiness
was
irresistible
she
was
really
hope
herself
as
described
by
collins
thou
oh
hope
with
eyes
so
fair
what
was
thy
delighted
measure
and
glenmurray
as
he
listened
to
her
forgot
his
illness
forgot
every
thing
but
what
adeline
chose
to
imagine
the
place
of
their
retreat
was
fixed
upon
it
was
to
be
a
little
village
near
falmouth
the
scene
of
their
first
happiness
the
garden
was
laid
out
mrs
mowbray
library
planned
and
so
completely
were
they
lost
in
their
charming
prospects
for
the
future
that
every
had
to
wait
a
longer
time
than
he
was
accustomed
to
for
his
money
and
the
postillion
had
driven
into
london
in
the
way
to
the
hotel
before
adeline
recollected
that
she
was
for
the
first
time
in
a
city
which
she
had
long
wished
most
ardently
to
see
they
had
scarcely
taken
up
their
abode
at
the
hotel
recommended
to
them
by
dr
norberry
when
he
knocked
at
the
door
adeline
from
the
window
had
seen
him
coming
and
sure
as
she
thought
herself
to
be
of
her
forgiveness
she
turned
sick
and
faint
when
the
decisive
moment
was
at
hand
and
hurrying
out
of
the
room
she
begged
glenmurray
to
receive
the
doctor
and
apologize
for
her
absence
glenmurray
awaited
him
with
a
beating
heart
he
listened
to
his
step
on
the
stairs
it
was
slow
and
heavy
unlike
that
of
a
benevolent
man
coming
to
communicate
good
news
glenmurray
began
immediately
to
tremble
for
the
peace
of
adeline
and
hastily
pouring
out
a
glass
of
wine
was
on
the
point
of
drinking
it
when
dr
norberry
entered
me
a
glass
cried
he
want
one
i
am
sure
to
recruit
my
spirits
glenmurray
in
silence
complied
with
his
desire
give
you
a
toast
cried
the
doctor
is
at
this
moment
adeline
entered
she
had
heard
the
doctor
last
words
and
she
thought
he
was
going
to
drink
to
the
reconciliation
of
her
mother
and
herself
and
hastily
opening
the
door
she
came
to
receive
the
good
news
which
awaited
her
but
at
sight
of
her
the
toast
died
unfinished
on
her
old
friend
lips
he
swallowed
down
the
wine
in
silence
and
then
taking
her
hand
led
her
to
the
sofa
adeline
heart
began
to
die
within
her
and
before
the
doctor
after
having
taken
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
blowed
his
nose
full
three
times
was
prepared
to
speak
she
was
convinced
that
she
had
nothing
but
unwelcome
intelligence
to
receive
and
she
awaited
in
trembling
expectation
an
answer
to
a
sir
from
glenmurray
spoken
in
a
tone
of
fearful
emotion
it
is
not
well
sir
replied
the
doctor
have
seen
my
mother
said
adeline
catching
hold
of
the
arm
of
the
sofa
for
support
and
in
an
instant
glenmurray
was
by
her
side
have
seen
mrs
mowbray
but
not
your
mother
for
i
have
seen
a
woman
dead
to
every
graceful
impulse
of
maternal
affection
and
alive
only
to
a
selfish
sense
of
rivalship
and
hatred
my
poor
child
god
forgive
the
deluded
woman
but
i
declare
she
detests
you
me
exclaimed
adeline
she
swears
that
she
can
never
forgive
the
preference
which
that
vile
fellow
gave
you
and
i
am
convinced
that
she
will
keep
her
word
and
here
the
doctor
turning
round
saw
adeline
lying
immoveable
in
glenmurray
arms
but
she
did
not
long
remain
so
and
with
a
frantic
scream
kept
repeating
the
words
detests
me
till
unable
to
contend
any
longer
with
the
acuteness
of
her
feelings
she
sunk
sobbing
convulsively
exhausted
on
the
bed
to
which
they
carried
her
good
friend
my
only
friend
cried
glenmurray
is
to
be
done
will
she
scream
again
think
you
in
that
most
dreadful
and
manner
for
if
she
does
i
must
run
out
of
the
house
then
she
never
treated
you
in
this
pretty
way
before
heh
never
her
has
always
been
exemplary
lucky
fellow
my
wife
and
daughters
often
scream
just
as
loud
on
very
trifling
occasions
but
that
scream
went
to
my
heart
for
i
well
know
how
to
distinguish
between
the
shriek
of
agony
and
that
of
passion
when
adeline
recovered
she
ardently
conjured
dr
norberry
to
procure
her
an
interview
with
her
mother
contending
that
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
suppose
that
the
sight
of
a
child
so
long
and
tenderly
loved
should
not
renew
a
little
of
her
now
dormant
affection
you
were
her
rival
as
well
as
her
child
remember
that
however
you
look
so
ill
that
now
if
ever
she
will
forgive
you
i
think
therefore
i
will
go
back
to
mrs
mowbray
and
while
i
am
there
do
you
come
ask
for
me
and
follow
the
servant
into
the
room
will
replied
adeline
and
leaning
on
the
arm
of
her
lover
she
slowly
followed
the
doctor
to
her
mother
hotel
chapter
xvi
is
the
most
awful
moment
of
my
life
said
adeline
the
most
anxious
one
of
mine
replied
glenmurray
mrs
mowbray
forgives
you
it
will
be
probably
on
condition
that
be
the
conditions
i
must
accept
them
said
adeline
returned
glenmurray
wiping
the
cold
dews
of
weakness
from
his
forehead
no
matter
at
any
rate
i
should
not
have
been
with
you
long
adeline
with
a
look
of
agony
pressed
the
arm
she
held
to
her
bosom
glenmurray
heart
smote
him
immediately
he
felt
he
had
been
ungenerous
and
while
the
hectic
of
a
moment
passed
across
his
cheek
he
added
i
do
not
do
myself
justice
in
saying
so
i
believe
my
best
chance
of
recovery
is
the
certainty
of
your
being
easy
let
me
but
see
you
happy
and
so
disinterested
is
my
affection
as
i
have
often
told
you
that
i
shall
cheerfully
assent
to
any
thing
that
may
ensure
your
happiness
can
you
think
answered
adeline
my
happiness
can
be
independent
of
yours
do
you
not
see
that
i
am
only
trying
to
prepare
my
mind
for
being
called
upon
to
surrender
my
inclinations
to
my
duty
at
this
moment
they
found
themselves
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
neither
of
them
spoke
the
moment
of
trial
was
come
and
both
were
unable
to
encounter
it
firmly
at
last
adeline
grasped
her
lover
hand
bade
him
wait
for
her
at
the
end
of
the
street
and
with
some
degree
of
firmness
she
entered
the
vestibule
and
asked
for
dr
norberry
dr
norberry
meanwhile
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
had
but
ill
prepared
mrs
mowbray
mind
for
the
intended
visit
he
had
again
talked
to
her
of
her
daughter
and
urged
the
propriety
of
forgiving
her
but
he
had
at
the
same
time
renewed
his
animadversions
on
her
own
conduct
know
not
dr
norberry
observed
mrs
mowbray
pains
i
took
with
the
education
of
that
girl
and
i
expected
to
be
repaid
for
it
by
being
styled
the
happiest
as
well
as
best
of
mothers
so
you
would
perhaps
had
you
not
wished
to
be
a
wife
as
well
as
mother
more
on
that
subject
sir
haughtily
returned
mrs
adeline
was
indeed
my
joy
my
pride
and
pride
will
have
a
fall
and
a
pretty
tumble
yours
has
had
to
be
sure
my
old
friend
and
it
has
broke
its
knees
never
to
be
sound
again
at
this
unpropitious
moment
lady
to
dr
norberry
was
announced
and
adeline
tottered
into
the
room
strange
intrusion
is
this
cried
mrs
mowbray
is
this
woman
adeline
threw
back
her
veil
and
falling
on
her
knees
stretched
out
her
arms
in
an
attitude
of
entreaty
speak
she
could
not
but
her
countenance
was
sufficiently
expressive
of
her
meaning
and
her
pale
sunk
cheek
spoke
forcibly
to
the
heart
of
her
at
this
moment
when
a
struggle
which
might
have
ended
favourably
for
adeline
was
taking
place
in
the
mind
of
mrs
mowbray
dr
norberry
injudiciously
exclaimed
there
she
is
look
at
her
poor
soul
there
is
little
fear
i
think
of
her
ever
rivalling
you
again
at
these
words
mrs
mowbray
darted
an
angry
look
at
the
doctor
and
desired
him
to
take
away
that
woman
who
came
no
doubt
instigated
by
him
to
insult
her
her
away
she
said
never
let
me
see
her
again
my
mother
hear
me
in
pity
hear
me
exclaimed
adeline
it
is
for
the
last
time
i
will
hear
you
replied
mrs
mowbray
never
no
never
will
i
behold
you
more
hear
me
vow
for
mercy
sake
make
not
a
vow
so
terrible
cried
adeline
gathering
courage
from
despair
and
approaching
her
have
grievously
erred
and
will
cheerfully
devote
the
rest
of
my
life
to
endeavour
by
the
most
submissive
obedience
and
attention
to
atone
for
my
past
guilt
for
it
impossible
for
the
misery
which
i
owe
to
you
no
submission
no
future
conduct
can
make
me
amends
away
i
say
your
presence
conjures
up
recollections
which
distract
me
and
i
solemnly
swear
hold
if
you
have
any
mercy
in
your
nature
cried
adeline
almost
frantic
is
i
feel
but
too
sensibly
the
most
awful
and
important
moment
of
my
life
on
the
result
of
this
interview
depends
my
future
happiness
or
misery
hear
me
o
my
mother
you
who
can
so
easily
resolve
to
tear
the
heart
of
a
child
that
adores
you
hear
me
reflect
that
if
you
vow
to
abandon
me
for
ever
you
blast
all
the
happiness
and
prospects
of
my
life
and
at
nineteen
is
hard
to
be
deprived
of
happiness
for
ever
true
i
may
not
long
survive
the
anguish
of
being
renounced
by
my
mother
a
mother
whom
i
love
with
even
enthusiastic
fondness
but
then
could
you
ever
know
peace
again
with
the
conviction
of
having
caused
my
death
oh
no
save
then
yourself
and
me
from
these
miseries
by
forgiving
my
past
errors
and
deigning
sometimes
to
see
and
converse
with
me
the
eager
and
animated
volubility
with
which
adeline
spoke
made
it
impossible
to
interrupt
her
even
had
mrs
mowbray
been
inclined
to
do
so
but
she
was
not
nor
when
adeline
had
done
speaking
could
she
find
in
her
heart
to
break
silence
it
was
evident
to
dr
norberry
that
mrs
mowbray
countenance
expressed
a
degree
of
softness
which
augured
well
for
her
daughter
and
as
if
conscious
that
it
did
so
she
covered
her
face
suddenly
with
her
handkerchief
then
is
the
time
thought
the
doctor
nearer
her
my
child
said
he
in
a
low
voice
to
adeline
her
knees
adeline
rose
and
approached
mrs
mowbray
she
seized
her
hand
she
pressed
it
to
her
lips
mrs
mowbray
bosom
heaved
violently
she
almost
returned
the
pressure
of
adeline
hand
victory
muttered
the
doctor
to
himself
cutting
a
caper
behind
mrs
mowbray
chair
mrs
mowbray
took
the
handkerchief
from
her
face
mother
my
dear
mother
look
on
me
look
on
me
with
kindness
only
one
moment
and
only
say
that
you
do
not
hate
me
mrs
mowbray
turned
round
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
adeline
with
a
look
of
kindness
and
adeline
began
to
sparkle
with
delight
when
as
she
threw
back
her
cloak
which
hanging
over
her
arm
embarrassed
her
as
she
knelt
to
embrace
her
mother
knees
mrs
mowbray
eyes
glanced
from
her
face
to
her
shape
in
an
instant
the
fierceness
of
her
look
returned
to
thy
race
disgrace
to
thy
family
she
exclaimed
spurning
her
kneeling
child
from
her
canst
thou
while
conscious
of
carrying
in
thy
bosom
the
proof
of
thy
infamy
dare
to
solicit
and
expect
my
pardon
hence
ere
i
load
thee
with
maledictions
adeline
wrapped
her
cloak
round
her
and
sunk
terrified
and
desponding
to
the
ground
what
a
ridiculous
caprice
is
this
cried
the
doctor
it
a
greater
crime
to
be
in
a
family
way
than
to
live
with
a
man
as
his
mistress
you
knew
your
daughter
had
done
the
last
therefore
it
is
nonsense
to
be
so
affected
at
the
come
come
forget
and
forgive
and
if
you
do
not
leave
the
house
with
her
this
moment
i
will
not
stay
in
it
my
injuries
are
so
great
that
they
can
not
admit
forgiveness
a
horrible
unforgiving
spirit
yours
must
be
cried
dr
norberry
after
all
i
tell
you
again
that
adeline
has
something
to
forgive
and
forget
too
and
she
sets
you
an
example
of
christian
charity
in
coming
hither
to
console
and
comfort
you
poor
forsaken
woman
as
you
are
exclaimed
mrs
mowbray
why
and
for
whom
was
i
forsaken
there
the
pang
and
yet
you
wonder
that
i
can
not
instantly
forgive
and
receive
the
woman
who
injured
me
where
i
was
most
vulnerable
my
mother
cried
adeline
almost
indignantly
can
that
wretch
though
dead
still
have
power
to
influence
my
fate
in
this
dreadful
manner
and
can
you
still
regret
the
loss
of
the
affection
of
that
man
whose
addresses
were
a
disgrace
to
you
at
these
unguarded
words
and
too
just
reproaches
mrs
mowbray
lost
all
and
in
a
voice
almost
inarticulate
with
rage
exclaimed
loved
that
wretch
as
you
are
pleased
to
call
him
i
gloried
in
the
addresses
which
you
are
pleased
to
call
my
disgrace
but
he
loved
you
he
left
me
for
you
and
on
your
account
he
made
me
endure
the
pangs
of
being
forsaken
and
despised
by
the
man
whom
i
adored
then
mark
my
words
i
solemnly
swear
dropping
on
her
knees
as
she
spoke
all
my
hopes
of
happiness
hereafter
that
until
you
shall
have
experienced
the
anguish
of
having
lost
the
man
whom
you
adore
till
shall
have
been
as
wretched
in
love
and
as
disgraced
in
the
eye
of
the
world
as
i
have
been
i
never
will
see
you
more
or
pardon
your
many
sins
against
me
no
not
even
were
you
on
your
yet
no
i
am
wrong
there
yes
on
your
she
added
her
voice
faltering
as
she
spoke
and
passion
giving
way
in
a
degree
to
the
dictates
of
returning
nature
there
there
i
should
i
should
forgive
you
i
feel
that
you
will
forgive
me
soon
faintly
articulated
adeline
sinking
on
the
ground
while
mrs
mowbray
was
leaving
the
room
and
dr
norberry
was
standing
motionless
with
horror
from
the
rash
oath
which
he
had
just
heard
but
adeline
fall
aroused
him
from
his
stupor
pity
sake
do
not
go
and
leave
your
daughter
dying
cried
he
vow
does
not
forbid
you
to
continue
to
see
her
now
mrs
mowbray
turned
back
and
started
with
horror
at
beholding
the
countenance
of
adeline
she
really
dying
cried
she
eagerly
have
i
killed
her
these
words
spoken
in
a
faltering
tone
and
with
a
look
of
anxiety
seemed
to
recall
the
fleeting
spirit
of
adeline
she
looked
up
at
her
mother
a
sort
of
smile
quivered
on
her
lip
and
faintly
articulating
am
better
she
burst
into
a
convulsive
flood
of
tears
and
laid
her
head
on
the
bosom
of
her
compassionate
friend
will
do
now
cried
he
exultingly
to
mrs
mowbray
need
alarm
yourself
no
longer
but
alarm
was
perhaps
a
feeling
of
enjoyment
to
the
sensations
which
then
took
possession
of
mrs
mowbray
the
apparent
danger
of
adeline
had
awakened
her
long
dormant
tenderness
but
she
had
just
bound
herself
by
an
oath
not
to
give
way
to
it
except
under
circumstances
the
most
unwelcome
and
affecting
and
had
therefore
embittered
her
future
days
with
remorse
and
unavailing
for
some
minutes
she
stood
looking
wildly
and
mournfully
on
adeline
longing
to
clasp
her
to
her
bosom
and
pronounce
her
pardon
but
not
daring
to
violate
her
oath
at
length
can
not
bear
this
torment
she
exclaimed
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
and
when
in
another
apartment
she
recollected
and
uttered
a
scream
of
agony
as
she
did
so
that
she
had
seen
adeline
probably
for
the
last
time
for
voluntarily
she
was
now
to
see
her
no
more
the
same
recollections
occurred
to
adeline
and
as
the
door
closed
on
her
mother
she
raised
herself
up
and
looked
eagerly
to
catch
the
last
glimpse
of
her
gown
as
the
door
shut
it
from
her
sight
us
go
away
directly
now
said
she
the
air
of
this
room
is
not
good
for
me
the
doctor
affected
beyond
measure
at
the
expression
of
quiet
despair
with
which
she
spoke
went
out
to
order
a
coach
and
adeline
instantly
rose
and
kissed
with
fond
devotion
the
chair
on
which
her
mother
had
sat
suddenly
she
heard
a
deep
sigh
it
came
from
the
next
room
perhaps
it
came
from
her
mother
perhaps
she
could
still
see
her
again
and
with
cautious
step
she
knelt
down
and
looked
through
the
of
the
door
she
did
see
her
mother
once
more
mrs
mowbray
was
lying
on
the
bed
beating
the
ground
with
her
foot
and
sighing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
that
i
dare
go
in
to
her
said
adeline
to
herself
i
can
at
least
bid
her
farewell
here
she
then
put
her
mouth
to
the
aperture
and
exclaimed
dearest
mother
since
we
meet
now
for
the
last
time
mrs
mowbray
started
from
the
bed
me
thank
you
for
all
the
affection
all
the
kindness
which
you
lavished
on
me
during
eighteen
happy
years
i
shall
never
cease
to
love
and
pray
for
you
mrs
mowbray
sobbed
aloud
you
will
some
day
or
other
think
you
have
been
harsh
to
me
and
may
wish
that
you
had
not
taken
so
cruel
a
vow
mrs
mowbray
beat
her
breast
in
agony
the
moment
of
repentance
was
already
come
may
therefore
be
a
comfort
to
you
at
such
moments
to
know
that
i
sincerely
and
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
forgive
this
rash
action
and
now
my
dearest
mother
hear
my
parting
prayers
for
your
happiness
at
this
moment
a
noise
in
the
next
room
convinced
adeline
that
her
mother
had
fallen
down
in
a
fainting
fit
and
the
doctor
entered
the
room
have
i
done
she
exclaimed
to
her
this
instant
he
obeyed
raising
up
mrs
mowbray
in
his
arms
he
laid
her
on
the
bed
while
adeline
bent
over
her
in
silent
anguish
with
all
the
sorrow
of
filial
anxiety
but
when
the
remedies
which
dr
norberry
administered
began
to
take
effect
she
exclaimed
the
last
time
cruel
but
most
dear
mother
and
pressed
her
head
to
her
bosom
and
kissed
her
pale
lips
with
almost
frantic
emotion
mrs
mowbray
opened
her
eyes
they
met
those
of
adeline
and
instantly
closed
again
has
looked
at
me
for
the
last
time
said
adeline
now
this
one
kiss
my
mother
and
farewell
for
ever
so
saying
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
and
did
not
stop
till
she
reached
the
coach
which
glenmurray
had
called
and
springing
into
it
was
received
into
the
arms
of
glenmurray
are
my
all
now
said
she
have
long
been
mine
replied
he
but
respecting
the
anguish
and
disappointment
depicted
on
her
countenance
he
forbore
to
ask
for
an
explanation
and
resting
her
pale
cheek
on
his
bosom
they
reached
the
inn
in
silence
adeline
had
walked
up
and
down
the
room
a
number
of
times
had
as
often
looked
out
of
the
window
before
dr
norberry
whom
she
had
been
anxiously
expecting
and
looking
for
made
his
appearance
god
you
are
come
at
last
said
she
seizing
his
hand
as
he
entered
left
mrs
mowbray
replied
he
better
both
in
mind
and
body
blessed
hearing
replied
adeline
you
my
child
how
are
you
asked
the
doctor
affectionately
know
not
yet
answered
adeline
mournfully
yet
i
am
stunned
by
the
blow
which
i
have
received
but
pray
tell
me
what
has
passed
between
you
and
my
mother
since
we
left
the
hotel
has
passed
cried
dr
norberry
starting
from
his
chair
taking
two
hasty
strides
across
the
room
pulling
up
the
cape
of
his
coat
and
muttering
an
oath
between
his
shut
teeth
this
passed
the
deluded
woman
renounced
her
daughter
and
her
friend
her
old
and
faithful
friend
has
renounced
her
my
poor
mother
exclaimed
adeline
girl
do
be
foolish
replied
the
doctor
your
pity
for
more
deserving
objects
and
as
the
wisest
thing
you
can
do
endeavour
to
forget
your
mother
her
never
well
you
will
be
wiser
in
time
and
now
you
shall
hear
all
that
passed
when
she
recovered
entirely
and
found
that
you
were
gone
she
gave
way
to
an
agony
of
sorrow
such
as
i
never
before
witnessed
for
i
believe
that
i
never
beheld
before
the
agony
of
remorse
poor
mother
cried
adeline
again
bursting
into
tears
again
exclaimed
the
doctor
adeline
motioned
to
him
to
go
on
and
he
continued
sight
of
this
i
was
weak
enough
to
pity
her
and
with
the
greatest
simplicity
i
told
her
that
i
was
glad
to
see
that
she
felt
penitent
for
her
conduct
since
penitence
paved
the
way
to
amendment
when
to
my
great
surprise
all
the
vanished
fierceness
and
haughtiness
of
her
look
returned
and
she
told
me
that
so
far
from
repenting
she
approved
of
her
conduct
and
that
remorse
had
no
share
in
her
sorrow
that
she
wept
from
consciousness
of
misery
inflicted
by
the
faults
of
others
not
her
own
dr
norberry
cried
adeline
reproachfully
doubt
by
awakening
her
pride
you
destroyed
the
tenderness
returning
towards
me
be
so
however
so
much
the
better
for
anger
is
a
less
painful
state
of
mind
to
endure
than
that
of
remorse
and
while
she
thinks
herself
only
injured
and
aggrieved
she
will
be
less
unhappy
continued
adeline
in
a
faltering
voice
care
not
how
long
she
hates
me
dr
norberry
looked
at
adeline
a
moment
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
evidently
gulped
down
a
rising
sob
child
good
child
he
at
length
articulated
she
forget
and
forgive
all
in
time
i
do
not
doubt
remember
her
oath
do
you
really
suppose
that
she
will
think
herself
bound
to
keep
so
silly
and
rash
an
oath
an
oath
made
in
the
heat
of
passion
i
do
and
i
know
that
were
she
to
break
it
she
would
never
be
otherwise
than
wretched
all
her
life
after
therefore
unless
glenmurray
forsakes
me
she
added
trying
to
smile
archly
as
she
spoke
and
this
i
am
not
happy
enough
to
expect
i
look
on
our
separation
in
this
world
to
be
eternal
do
then
poor
devil
how
miserable
she
will
be
when
her
present
resentment
shall
subside
well
when
that
time
comes
i
may
perhaps
see
her
again
added
the
doctor
gulping
again
bless
you
for
that
intention
cried
adeline
how
could
you
ever
have
the
heart
to
renounce
her
you
are
almost
as
provoking
as
your
mother
why
how
could
i
have
the
heart
to
do
otherwise
when
she
whitewashed
herself
and
blackened
you
to
be
sure
it
did
cause
me
a
twinge
or
two
to
do
it
and
had
she
been
an
iota
less
haughty
i
should
have
turned
back
and
said
kiss
and
be
friends
again
but
she
seemed
so
provokingly
anxious
to
get
rid
of
me
and
waved
me
with
her
hand
to
the
door
in
such
a
tragedy
queen
sort
of
a
manner
that
having
told
her
very
civilly
to
go
to
the
devil
her
own
way
i
gulped
down
a
sort
of
a
tender
choking
in
my
throat
and
made
as
rapid
an
exit
as
possible
and
now
another
trial
awaits
me
i
came
to
town
at
some
inconvenience
to
myself
to
try
to
do
you
service
i
have
failed
and
i
have
now
no
further
business
here
so
we
must
part
and
i
know
not
when
we
shall
meet
again
for
i
rarely
leave
home
and
may
not
see
you
again
for
years
exclaimed
adeline
looking
at
glenmurray
might
settle
in
dr
norberry
neighbourhood
glenmurray
said
nothing
but
looked
at
the
doctor
who
seemed
confused
and
was
silent
ye
my
dear
girl
said
he
at
length
idea
of
your
settling
near
me
occurred
to
me
but
here
he
took
two
hasty
strides
across
the
room
short
that
an
impossible
thing
so
i
beg
you
to
think
no
more
about
it
if
indeed
you
mean
to
marry
mr
glenmurray
i
shall
not
do
replied
adeline
coldly
again
now
cried
the
doctor
pettishly
in
your
way
are
quite
as
obstinate
and
ridiculous
as
your
mother
however
i
hope
you
will
know
better
in
time
but
it
grows
late
is
time
i
should
be
in
my
chaise
and
i
hear
it
driving
up
mr
glenmurray
continued
he
in
an
altered
tone
of
voice
your
care
and
your
tenderness
i
leave
this
poor
child
and
zounds
man
if
you
will
but
burn
your
books
before
her
face
and
swear
they
are
stuff
why
i
say
i
would
come
to
town
on
purpose
to
do
you
adeline
my
child
god
bless
you
i
have
loved
you
from
your
infancy
and
i
wish
from
my
soul
that
i
left
you
in
a
better
situation
but
you
will
write
to
me
heh
one
kiss
do
be
jealous
glenmurray
your
hand
woons
what
a
hand
my
dear
fellow
take
care
of
yourself
for
that
poor
child
sake
get
the
advice
which
i
recommended
and
good
air
a
rising
sob
interrupted
him
he
hemmed
it
off
and
ran
into
his
chaise
chapter
xvii
then
said
adeline
her
tears
dropping
fast
as
she
spoke
then
we
are
alone
in
the
world
henceforward
we
must
be
all
to
each
other
the
idea
a
painful
one
adeline
replied
glenmurray
reproachfully
so
returned
adeline
i
ca
yet
forget
that
i
had
a
mother
and
a
kind
one
too
may
have
again
there
is
a
vow
in
heaven
against
it
no
my
plans
for
future
happiness
must
be
laid
unmindful
and
independent
of
her
they
must
have
you
and
your
happiness
for
their
sole
object
i
must
live
for
you
alone
and
you
added
she
in
a
faltering
voice
live
for
me
will
live
as
long
as
i
can
replied
glenmurray
sighing
as
one
step
towards
it
i
shall
keep
early
hours
so
to
rest
dear
adeline
and
let
us
forget
our
sorrows
as
soon
as
possible
the
next
morning
adeline
and
glenmurray
first
care
was
to
determine
on
their
future
residence
it
was
desirable
that
it
should
be
at
a
sufficient
distance
from
london
to
deserve
the
name
and
have
the
conveniences
of
a
country
abode
yet
sufficiently
near
it
for
glenmurray
to
have
the
advice
of
a
london
physician
if
necessary
we
fix
at
richmond
said
glenmurray
and
adeline
to
whom
the
idea
of
dwelling
on
a
spot
at
once
so
classical
and
beautiful
was
most
welcome
joyfully
consented
and
in
a
few
days
they
were
settled
there
in
a
pleasant
but
expensive
lodging
but
here
as
when
abroad
glenmurray
occasionally
saw
old
acquaintances
many
of
whom
were
willing
to
renew
their
intercourse
with
him
for
the
sake
of
being
introduced
to
adeline
and
who
from
a
knowledge
of
her
situation
presumed
to
pay
her
that
sort
of
homage
which
though
not
understood
by
her
gave
pangs
unutterable
to
the
delicate
mind
of
glenmurray
she
my
wife
they
dared
not
pay
her
such
marked
attention
said
he
to
himself
and
again
as
delicately
as
he
could
he
urged
adeline
to
sacrifice
her
principles
to
the
prejudices
of
society
thought
replied
adeline
gravely
as
we
lived
for
each
other
we
might
act
independent
of
society
and
serve
it
by
our
example
even
against
its
will
glenmurray
was
he
did
not
like
to
own
how
painful
and
mischievous
he
found
in
practice
the
principles
which
he
admired
in
theory
and
adeline
continued
me
glenmurray
ours
is
the
very
situation
calculated
to
urge
us
on
in
the
pursuit
of
truth
we
are
answerable
to
no
one
for
our
conduct
and
we
can
make
any
experiments
in
morals
that
we
choose
i
am
wholly
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
why
you
persist
in
urging
me
to
marry
you
take
care
my
dear
glenmurray
the
high
respect
i
bear
your
character
was
shaken
a
little
by
your
fighting
a
duel
in
defiance
of
your
principles
and
your
eagerness
to
marry
in
further
defiance
of
them
may
weaken
my
esteem
if
not
my
love
adeline
smiled
as
she
said
this
but
glenmurray
thought
she
spoke
more
in
earnest
than
she
was
willing
to
allow
and
alarmed
at
the
threat
he
only
answered
know
it
is
for
your
sake
merely
that
i
speak
and
dropped
the
subject
secretly
resolving
however
that
he
would
not
walk
with
adeline
in
the
fashionable
promenades
at
the
hours
commonly
spent
there
by
the
beau
monde
but
in
spite
of
this
precaution
they
could
not
escape
the
assiduities
of
some
gay
men
of
fashion
who
knew
glenmurray
and
admired
his
companion
and
adeline
at
length
suspected
that
glenmurray
was
jealous
but
in
this
she
wronged
him
it
was
not
the
attention
paid
her
but
the
nature
of
it
that
disturbed
him
nor
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
adeline
herself
was
eager
to
avoid
the
public
walks
when
it
is
known
that
one
of
her
admirers
at
richmond
was
the
colonel
mordaunt
whom
she
had
become
acquainted
with
at
bath
colonel
mordaunt
with
every
granted
prayer
was
just
beginning
to
feel
the
tedium
of
life
when
he
saw
adeline
unexpectedly
at
richmond
and
though
he
felt
shocked
at
first
at
beholding
her
in
so
different
a
situation
from
that
in
which
he
had
first
beheld
her
still
that
very
situation
by
holding
forth
to
him
a
prospect
of
being
favoured
by
her
in
his
turn
revived
his
admiration
with
more
than
its
original
violence
and
he
resolved
to
be
if
possible
the
lover
of
adeline
after
glenmurray
should
have
fallen
a
victim
as
he
had
no
doubt
but
he
would
to
his
dangerous
illness
but
the
opportunities
which
he
had
of
seeing
her
suddenly
ceased
she
no
longer
frequented
the
public
walks
and
him
though
he
suspected
it
not
she
most
studiously
avoided
for
she
could
not
bear
to
behold
the
alteration
in
his
manner
when
be
addressed
her
an
alteration
perhaps
unknown
to
himself
true
it
was
not
insulting
but
adeline
who
had
admired
him
too
much
at
bath
not
to
have
examined
with
minute
attention
the
almost
timid
expression
of
his
countenance
and
the
respectfulness
of
his
manner
when
he
addressed
her
shrunk
abashed
from
the
ardent
and
impassioned
expression
with
which
he
now
met
her
an
expression
which
adeline
used
to
call
like
sir
patrick
and
which
indicated
even
to
her
inexperience
that
the
admiration
which
he
then
felt
was
of
a
nature
less
pure
and
flattering
than
the
one
which
she
excited
before
and
though
in
her
own
eyes
she
appeared
as
worthy
of
respect
as
ever
she
was
forced
to
own
even
to
herself
that
persons
in
general
would
be
of
a
contrary
opinion
but
in
vain
did
she
resolve
to
walk
very
early
in
a
morning
only
being
fully
persuaded
that
she
should
then
meet
with
no
one
colonel
mordaunt
was
as
wakeful
as
she
was
and
being
convinced
that
she
walked
during
some
part
of
the
day
and
probably
early
in
a
morning
he
resolved
to
watch
near
the
door
of
her
lodgings
in
hopes
to
obtain
an
conversation
with
her
the
consequence
was
that
he
saw
adeline
one
morning
walk
pensively
alone
down
the
shady
road
that
leads
from
the
terrace
to
petersham
this
opportunity
was
not
to
be
overlooked
and
he
overtook
and
accosted
her
with
such
an
expression
of
pleasure
on
his
countenance
as
was
sufficient
to
alarm
the
now
suspicious
delicacy
of
adeline
and
conscious
as
she
was
that
glenmurray
beheld
colonel
mordaunt
attentions
with
pain
a
deep
blush
overspread
her
cheek
at
his
approach
while
her
eyes
were
timidly
cast
down
colonel
mordaunt
saw
her
emotion
and
attributed
it
to
a
cause
flattering
to
his
vanity
it
even
encouraged
him
to
seize
her
hand
and
while
he
openly
congratulated
himself
on
his
good
fortune
in
meeting
her
alone
he
presumed
to
press
her
hand
to
his
lips
adeline
indignantly
withdrew
it
and
replied
very
coldly
to
his
inquiries
concerning
her
health
where
have
you
hidden
yourself
lately
cried
miss
mowbray
loveliest
and
i
may
add
most
beloved
of
women
how
have
i
longed
to
see
you
alone
and
pour
out
my
whole
soul
to
you
adeline
answered
this
rhapsody
by
a
look
of
astonishment
only
being
silent
from
disgust
and
consternation
while
involuntarily
she
quickened
her
pace
as
if
wishing
to
avoid
him
hear
me
and
hear
me
patiently
he
resumed
must
have
noticed
the
effect
which
your
charms
produced
on
me
at
bath
and
may
i
dare
to
add
that
my
attentions
then
did
not
seem
displeasing
to
you
interrupted
adeline
sighing
deeply
situation
is
now
changed
and
is
so
i
thank
fortune
that
it
is
so
replied
colonel
mordaunt
i
am
happy
to
say
it
is
changed
by
no
crime
of
mine
here
adeline
started
and
turned
pale
i
were
unworthy
all
chance
of
happiness
were
i
to
pass
by
the
seeming
opportunity
of
being
blest
which
the
alteration
to
which
you
allude
holds
forth
to
me
here
he
paused
as
if
in
embarrassment
but
adeline
was
unable
to
interrupt
him
mowbray
he
at
length
continued
am
told
that
you
are
not
on
good
terms
with
your
mother
nay
i
have
heard
that
she
has
renounced
you
may
i
presume
to
ask
if
this
be
true
is
answered
adeline
trembling
with
emotion
as
before
long
it
is
probable
that
you
will
be
without
without
a
protector
adeline
turned
round
and
fixed
her
eyes
wildly
upon
him
be
sure
continued
he
avoiding
her
steadfast
gaze
could
wish
to
call
you
mine
this
moment
but
unhappy
as
you
appear
to
be
in
your
present
situation
i
know
unlike
many
women
circumstanced
as
you
are
you
are
too
generous
and
to
be
capable
of
forsaking
in
his
last
illness
the
man
whom
in
his
happier
moments
you
have
honoured
with
your
love
as
he
said
this
adeline
her
lips
parched
with
agitation
and
breathing
short
caught
hold
of
his
arm
and
pressing
her
cold
hand
he
went
on
i
will
not
venture
even
to
wish
to
be
honoured
with
a
kind
look
from
you
till
mr
glenmurray
is
removed
to
a
happier
world
but
then
dearest
of
women
you
whom
i
loved
without
hope
of
possessing
you
and
whom
now
i
dote
upon
to
madness
i
conjure
you
to
admit
my
visits
and
let
my
attentions
prevail
on
you
to
accept
my
protection
and
allow
me
to
devote
the
remainder
of
my
days
to
love
and
you
heaven
exclaimed
adeline
clasping
her
hands
together
what
insults
am
i
reserved
echoed
colonel
mordaunt
sir
replied
adeline
have
insulted
me
grossly
insulted
me
and
know
not
the
woman
whom
you
have
tortured
to
the
very
soul
me
hear
me
miss
mowbray
exclaimed
colonel
mordaunt
almost
as
much
agitated
as
herself
heaven
i
meant
not
to
insult
you
and
perhaps
i
perhaps
i
have
been
misinformed
no
yes
yes
it
must
be
so
your
indignation
proves
that
i
have
you
are
no
doubt
and
on
my
knees
i
implore
your
pardon
you
are
the
wife
of
mr
glenmurray
suppose
i
am
his
wife
cried
adeline
it
then
given
to
a
wife
only
to
be
secure
from
being
insulted
by
offers
horrible
to
the
delicacy
and
wounding
to
the
sensibility
like
those
which
i
have
heard
from
you
but
before
colonel
mordaunt
could
reply
adeline
thoughts
had
reverted
to
what
he
had
said
of
glenmurray
certain
danger
and
unable
to
bear
this
confirmation
of
her
fears
with
the
speed
of
phrensy
she
ran
towards
home
and
did
not
stop
till
she
was
in
sight
of
her
lodging
and
the
still
closed
curtain
of
her
apartment
met
her
view
is
still
sleeping
then
she
exclaimed
i
have
time
to
recover
myself
and
endeavour
to
hide
from
him
the
emotion
of
which
i
could
not
tell
the
reason
so
saying
she
softly
entered
the
house
and
by
the
time
glenmurray
rose
she
had
regained
her
composure
still
there
was
a
look
of
anxiety
on
her
fine
countenance
which
could
not
escape
the
penetrating
eye
of
love
are
you
so
grave
this
morning
said
glenmurray
as
adeline
seated
herself
at
the
breakfast
table
feel
much
better
and
more
cheerful
are
you
indeed
better
replied
adeline
fixing
her
tearful
eyes
on
him
i
much
deceive
myself
said
glenmurray
heaven
devoutly
replied
adeline
thought
i
thought
here
tears
choked
her
utterance
and
glenmurray
drew
from
her
a
confession
of
her
anxious
fears
for
him
though
she
prudently
resolved
not
to
agitate
him
by
telling
him
of
the
rencontre
with
colonel
mordaunt
but
when
the
continued
assurances
of
glenmurray
that
he
was
better
and
the
animation
of
his
countenance
had
in
a
degree
removed
her
fears
for
his
life
she
had
leisure
to
revert
to
another
source
of
uneasiness
and
to
dwell
on
the
insult
which
she
had
experienced
from
colonel
mordaunt
offer
of
protection
strange
and
irrational
thought
adeline
the
prejudices
of
society
because
an
idle
ceremony
has
not
been
muttered
over
me
at
the
altar
i
am
liable
to
be
thought
a
woman
of
vicious
inclinations
and
to
be
exposed
to
the
most
daring
insults
as
these
reflections
occurred
to
her
she
could
scarcely
help
regretting
that
her
principles
would
not
allow
her
delicacy
and
virtue
to
be
placed
under
the
sacred
shelter
bestowed
by
that
ceremony
which
she
was
pleased
to
call
idle
and
she
was
not
long
without
experiencing
still
further
hardships
from
the
situation
in
which
she
had
persisted
so
obstinately
to
remain
their
establishment
consisted
of
a
footman
and
a
maid
servant
but
the
latter
had
of
late
been
so
remiss
in
the
performance
of
her
duties
and
so
impertinent
when
reproved
for
her
faults
that
adeline
was
obliged
to
give
her
warning
indeed
replied
the
girl
mighty
hardship
truly
i
can
promise
you
i
did
not
mean
to
stay
long
it
is
no
such
favour
to
live
with
a
kept
miss
and
if
you
come
to
that
i
think
i
am
as
good
as
you
shocked
surprised
and
unable
to
answer
adeline
took
refuge
in
her
room
never
before
had
she
been
accosted
by
her
inferiors
without
respectful
attention
and
now
owing
to
her
situation
even
a
thought
herself
authorised
to
insult
her
and
to
raise
herself
to
her
level
surely
said
adeline
mentally
ought
to
reason
with
her
and
try
to
convince
her
that
i
am
in
reality
as
virtuous
as
if
i
were
glenmurray
wife
instead
of
his
mistress
accordingly
she
went
back
into
the
kitchen
but
her
resolution
failed
her
when
she
found
the
footman
there
listening
with
a
broad
grin
on
his
countenance
to
the
relation
which
mary
was
giving
him
of
the
trimming
which
she
had
given
scarcely
did
the
presence
of
adeline
interrupt
or
restrain
her
but
at
last
she
turned
round
and
said
pray
have
you
got
anything
to
say
to
me
more
now
meekly
replied
adeline
you
will
follow
me
to
my
chamber
all
my
heart
cried
the
girl
and
adeline
returned
to
her
own
room
wish
mary
to
set
you
right
said
adeline
respect
to
my
situation
you
called
me
i
think
a
kept
miss
and
seemed
to
think
ill
of
me
to
be
sure
replied
mary
a
little
alarmed
body
says
you
are
a
kept
lady
and
so
i
made
no
bones
of
saying
so
but
i
am
sure
if
so
be
you
are
not
so
why
i
ax
pardon
what
do
you
mean
by
the
term
kept
lady
a
lady
who
lives
with
a
man
without
being
married
to
him
i
take
it
and
that
i
take
to
be
your
case
ai
it
i
pray
adeline
blushed
and
was
silent
it
certainly
was
her
case
however
she
took
courage
and
went
on
mistresses
or
kept
ladies
in
general
are
women
of
bad
character
and
would
live
with
any
man
but
i
never
loved
nor
ever
shall
love
any
man
but
mr
glenmurray
i
look
on
myself
as
his
wife
in
the
sight
of
god
nor
will
i
quit
him
till
death
shall
separate
us
if
so
be
that
you
do
want
to
change
i
think
you
might
as
well
be
married
to
him
adeline
was
again
silent
for
a
moment
but
continued
glenmurray
would
marry
me
if
i
chose
well
if
master
is
inclined
to
make
an
honest
woman
of
you
you
had
better
take
him
at
his
word
i
think
heaven
cried
adeline
an
expression
why
will
you
persist
to
confound
me
with
those
deluded
women
who
are
victims
of
their
own
weakness
to
that
replied
mary
talk
too
fine
for
me
but
a
fact
is
a
fact
are
you
or
are
you
not
my
master
wife
am
not
then
you
are
his
mistress
and
a
kept
lady
to
all
intents
and
purposes
so
what
signifies
argufying
the
matter
i
lived
with
a
kept
madam
before
and
she
was
as
good
as
you
for
aught
i
know
adeline
shocked
and
disappointed
told
her
she
might
leave
the
room
am
going
pertly
answered
mary
to
seek
for
a
place
but
i
must
beg
that
you
will
not
own
you
are
no
better
than
you
should
be
when
a
lady
comes
to
ask
my
character
for
then
perhaps
i
should
not
get
any
one
to
take
me
i
shall
call
you
mrs
glenmurray
i
shall
not
call
so
replied
adeline
will
not
say
what
is
not
true
on
any
account
now
there
spite
and
yet
you
pretend
to
call
yourself
a
gentlewoman
and
to
be
better
than
other
kept
ladies
why
you
are
not
worthy
to
tie
the
shoestrings
of
my
last
mistress
she
did
not
mind
telling
a
lie
rather
than
lose
a
poor
servant
a
place
and
she
called
herself
a
married
woman
rather
than
hurt
me
she
nor
you
then
replied
adeline
gravely
sensible
of
what
great
importance
a
strict
adherence
to
veracity
is
to
the
interests
of
society
i
am
and
for
the
sake
of
mankind
i
will
always
tell
the
truth
had
better
tell
one
innocent
lie
for
mine
replied
the
girl
pertly
dare
to
say
the
world
will
neither
know
nor
care
anything
about
it
and
i
can
tell
you
i
shall
expect
you
will
so
saying
she
shut
the
door
with
violence
leaving
adeline
mournfully
musing
on
the
distress
attending
on
her
situation
and
even
disposed
to
question
the
propriety
of
remaining
in
it
the
inquietude
of
her
mind
as
usual
showed
itself
in
her
countenance
and
involved
her
in
another
difficulty
to
make
glenmurray
uneasy
by
an
avowal
of
what
had
passed
between
her
and
mary
was
impossible
yet
how
could
she
conceal
it
from
him
and
while
she
was
deliberating
on
this
point
glenmurray
entered
the
room
and
tenderly
inquired
what
had
so
evidently
disturbed
her
of
any
consequence
she
faltered
out
and
burst
into
tears
nothing
of
consequence
produce
such
emotion
answered
glenmurray
i
am
ashamed
to
own
the
cause
of
my
uneasiness
to
own
it
to
me
adeline
to
be
sure
you
have
a
great
deal
to
fear
from
my
severity
said
he
faintly
smiling
adeline
for
a
moment
resolved
to
tell
him
the
whole
truth
but
fearful
of
throwing
him
into
a
degree
of
agitation
hurtful
to
his
weak
frame
she
who
had
the
moment
before
so
nobly
supported
the
necessity
of
a
strict
adherence
to
truth
condescended
to
equivocate
and
evade
and
turning
away
her
head
while
a
conscious
blush
overspread
her
cheek
she
replied
know
that
i
look
forward
with
anxiety
and
uneasiness
to
the
time
of
my
approaching
confinement
glenmurray
believed
her
and
overcome
by
some
painful
feelings
which
fears
for
himself
and
anxiety
for
her
occasioned
him
he
silently
pressed
her
to
his
bosom
and
choked
with
contending
emotions
returned
to
his
own
apartment
i
have
stooped
to
the
meanness
of
disguising
the
truth
cried
adeline
clasping
her
hands
convulsively
together
surely
there
must
be
something
radically
wrong
in
a
situation
which
exposes
one
to
such
a
variety
of
degradations
mary
meanwhile
had
gone
in
search
of
a
place
and
having
found
the
lady
to
whom
she
had
been
advised
to
offer
herself
at
home
she
returned
to
tell
adeline
that
mrs
pemberton
would
call
in
half
an
hour
to
inquire
her
character
the
an
anxious
one
to
adeline
having
elapsed
a
lady
knocked
at
the
door
and
inquired
in
hearing
for
mrs
glenmurray
the
lady
cried
adeline
immediately
from
the
top
of
the
staircase
miss
mowbray
will
wait
on
her
directly
the
footman
obeyed
and
mrs
pemberton
was
ushered
into
the
parlour
and
now
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
adeline
trembled
to
approach
a
stranger
for
the
first
time
she
was
going
to
appear
before
a
conscious
she
was
become
an
object
of
scorn
and
though
an
enthusiast
for
virtue
would
be
considered
as
a
votary
of
vice
but
it
was
a
mortification
which
she
must
submit
to
undergo
and
hastily
throwing
a
large
shawl
over
her
shoulders
to
hide
her
figure
as
much
as
possible
with
a
trembling
hand
she
opened
the
door
and
found
herself
in
the
dreaded
presence
of
mrs
pemberton
nor
was
she
at
all
when
she
found
that
lady
dressed
in
the
neat
modest
garb
of
a
strict
quaker
a
garb
which
creates
an
immediate
idea
in
the
mind
of
more
than
common
rigidness
of
principles
and
sanctity
of
conduct
in
the
wearer
of
it
adeline
curtsied
in
silence
mrs
pemberton
bowed
her
head
courteously
then
with
a
countenance
of
great
sweetness
and
a
voice
calculated
to
inspire
confidence
said
believe
thy
name
is
mowbray
but
i
came
to
see
mrs
glenmurray
and
as
on
these
occasions
i
always
wish
to
confer
with
the
principal
wouldst
thou
if
it
be
not
inconvenient
ask
the
mistress
of
mary
to
let
me
see
her
am
myself
the
mistress
of
mary
replied
adeline
in
a
faint
voice
ask
thine
excuse
answered
mrs
pemberton
herself
thou
art
mrs
glenmurray
thou
art
the
person
i
wanted
to
see
here
adeline
changed
colour
overcome
with
the
consciousness
that
she
ought
to
undeceive
her
and
the
sense
of
the
difficulty
of
doing
so
thou
art
very
pale
and
seemest
uneasy
continued
the
gentle
quaker
hope
thy
husband
is
not
worse
glenmurray
but
not
my
husband
said
adeline
better
thou
not
married
asked
mrs
pemberton
with
quickness
am
not
yet
thou
livest
with
the
gentleman
i
named
and
art
the
person
whom
mary
called
mrs
glenmurray
am
replied
adeline
her
paleness
yielding
to
a
deep
crimson
and
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
mrs
pemberton
sat
for
a
minute
in
silence
then
rising
with
an
air
of
cold
dignity
fear
thy
servant
is
not
likely
to
suit
me
she
observed
i
will
not
detain
thee
any
longer
can
be
an
excellent
servant
faltered
out
adeline
likely
but
there
are
objections
so
saying
she
reached
the
door
but
as
she
passed
adeline
she
stopped
interested
and
affected
by
the
mournful
expression
of
her
countenance
and
the
visible
effort
she
made
to
retain
her
tears
adeline
saw
and
felt
humbled
at
the
compassion
which
her
countenance
expressed
to
be
an
object
of
pity
was
as
mortifying
as
to
be
an
object
of
scorn
and
she
turned
her
eyes
on
mrs
pemberton
with
a
look
of
proud
indignation
but
they
met
those
of
mrs
pemberton
fixed
on
her
with
a
look
of
such
benevolence
that
her
anger
was
instantly
subdued
and
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
make
the
benevolent
compassion
visible
in
mrs
pemberton
countenance
serviceable
to
her
discarded
servant
madam
she
cried
as
mrs
pemberton
was
about
to
leave
the
room
me
a
moment
conversation
with
you
mrs
pemberton
with
an
eagerness
which
she
suddenly
endeavoured
to
check
returned
to
her
seat
suspect
said
adeline
gathering
courage
from
the
conscious
kindness
of
her
motive
your
objection
to
take
mary
warner
into
your
service
proceeds
wholly
from
the
situation
of
her
present
mistress
judgest
rightly
was
mrs
pemberton
answer
do
i
wonder
continued
adeline
you
make
this
objection
when
i
consider
the
present
prejudices
of
society
softly
exclaimed
the
benevolent
quaker
adeline
faintly
smiled
and
went
on
surely
you
will
allow
that
in
a
family
quiet
and
secluded
as
ours
and
in
daily
contemplation
of
an
union
uninterrupted
faithful
and
virtuous
and
possessing
all
the
sacredness
of
marriage
though
without
the
name
it
is
not
likely
that
the
young
woman
in
question
should
have
imbibed
any
vicious
habits
or
principles
in
contemplating
thy
union
itself
she
has
lived
in
the
contemplation
of
vice
and
thou
wilt
own
that
by
having
given
it
an
air
of
respectability
thou
hast
only
made
it
more
dangerous
this
point
cried
adeline
see
we
must
disagree
i
shall
therefore
without
further
preamble
inform
you
madam
that
mary
aware
of
the
difficulty
of
procuring
a
service
if
it
were
known
that
she
had
lived
with
a
kept
mistress
as
the
phrase
is
here
an
indignant
blush
overspread
the
face
of
adeline
me
to
call
myself
the
wife
of
glenmurray
but
this
from
my
abhorrence
of
all
falsehood
i
peremptorily
refused
thou
didst
well
exclaimed
mrs
pemberton
i
respect
thy
resolution
my
sincerity
will
i
fear
prevent
the
poor
girl
obtaining
other
reputable
places
and
i
alas
am
not
rich
enough
to
make
her
amends
for
the
injury
which
my
conscience
forces
me
to
do
her
but
if
you
madam
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
take
her
into
your
family
even
for
a
short
time
only
to
wipe
away
the
disgrace
which
her
living
with
me
has
brought
upon
her
can
she
not
remain
with
thee
asked
mrs
pemberton
hastily
she
neglected
her
duty
and
when
reproved
for
it
replied
in
very
injurious
language
probably
on
thy
way
of
life
must
confess
that
she
has
reproached
me
with
it
this
was
all
her
fault
was
she
can
be
an
excellent
servant
hast
said
enough
thy
conscience
shall
not
have
the
additional
burthen
to
bear
of
having
deprived
a
poor
girl
of
her
maintenance
i
will
take
her
thousand
thanks
to
you
replied
adeline
have
removed
a
weight
off
my
mind
but
my
conscience
has
none
to
bear
returned
mrs
pemberton
thou
deem
thy
conduct
blameless
in
the
eyes
of
that
being
whom
thou
hast
just
blessed
far
as
my
connexion
with
mr
glenmurray
is
concerned
i
do
doubt
me
not
believe
me
that
i
never
wantonly
violate
the
truth
and
that
even
an
evasion
which
i
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
was
guilty
of
has
given
me
a
pang
to
which
i
will
not
again
expose
myself
yet
inconsistent
beings
as
we
are
cried
mrs
pemberton
at
a
gnat
and
swallowing
a
camel
what
is
the
guilt
of
the
evasion
which
weighs
on
thy
mind
compared
to
that
of
living
as
thou
dost
in
an
illicit
commerce
surely
surely
thine
heart
accuses
thee
for
thy
face
bespeaks
uneasiness
and
thou
wilt
listen
to
the
whispers
of
penitence
and
leave
ere
long
the
man
who
has
betrayed
thee
man
who
has
betrayed
me
mr
glenmurray
is
no
betrayer
he
is
one
of
the
best
of
human
beings
no
madam
if
i
had
acceded
to
his
wishes
i
should
long
ago
have
been
his
wife
but
from
a
conviction
of
the
folly
of
marriage
i
have
preferred
living
with
him
without
the
performance
of
a
ceremony
which
in
the
eye
of
reason
can
confer
neither
honour
nor
happiness
thing
exclaimed
mrs
pemberton
rising
as
she
spoke
understand
thee
now
thou
art
one
of
the
enlightened
as
they
call
themselves
thou
art
one
of
those
wise
in
their
own
conceit
who
disregarding
the
customs
of
ages
and
the
dictates
of
experience
set
up
their
own
opinions
against
the
hallowed
institutions
of
men
and
the
will
of
the
most
high
you
blame
me
interrupted
adeline
acting
according
to
what
i
think
right
hast
thou
well
studied
the
subject
on
which
thou
hast
decided
yet
alas
to
thee
how
vain
must
be
the
voice
of
admonition
she
continued
her
countenance
kindling
into
strong
expression
as
she
spoke
the
poor
victim
of
passion
and
persuasion
penitence
and
amendment
might
be
rationally
expected
and
she
from
the
path
of
frailty
might
turn
again
to
that
of
virtue
but
for
one
like
thee
glorying
in
thine
iniquity
and
erring
not
from
the
too
tender
heart
but
the
head
for
thee
there
is
i
fear
no
blessed
return
to
the
right
way
and
i
who
would
have
tarried
with
thee
even
in
the
house
of
sin
to
have
reclaimed
thee
penitent
now
hasten
from
thee
and
for
ever
firm
as
thou
art
in
guilt
as
she
said
this
she
reached
the
door
while
adeline
affected
by
her
emotion
and
distressed
by
her
language
stood
silent
and
almost
abashed
before
her
but
with
her
hand
on
the
lock
she
turned
round
and
in
a
gentler
voice
said
not
even
against
a
wilful
offender
like
thee
should
one
gate
that
may
lead
to
amendment
be
shut
thy
situation
and
thy
fortunes
may
soon
be
greatly
changed
affliction
may
subdue
thy
pride
and
the
counsel
of
a
friend
of
thine
own
sex
might
then
sound
sweetly
in
thine
ears
should
that
time
come
i
will
be
that
friend
i
am
now
about
to
set
off
for
lisbon
with
a
very
dear
friend
about
whom
i
feel
as
solicitous
as
thou
about
thy
glenmurray
and
there
i
shall
remain
some
time
here
then
is
my
address
and
if
thou
shouldest
want
my
advice
or
assistance
write
to
me
and
be
assured
that
rachel
pemberton
will
try
to
forget
thy
errors
in
thy
distresses
so
saying
she
left
the
room
but
returned
again
before
adeline
had
recovered
herself
from
the
various
emotions
which
she
had
experienced
during
her
address
to
ask
her
christian
name
but
when
adeline
replied
name
is
adeline
mowbray
mrs
pemberton
started
and
eagerly
exclaimed
thou
adeline
mowbray
of
gloucestershire
the
young
heiress
as
she
was
called
of
rosevalley
was
once
replied
adeline
sinking
back
into
a
chair
mowbray
of
rosevalley
mrs
pemberton
for
a
few
minutes
gazed
on
her
in
mournful
silence
art
thou
she
cried
mowbray
art
thou
that
courteous
blooming
blessed
being
for
every
tongue
that
i
heard
name
thee
blessed
thee
whom
i
saw
only
three
years
ago
bounding
over
thy
native
hills
all
grace
and
joy
and
innocence
adeline
tried
to
speak
but
her
voice
failed
her
thou
she
continued
mrs
pemberton
i
saw
also
leaning
from
the
window
of
her
mother
mansion
and
inquiring
with
the
countenance
of
a
pitying
angel
concerning
the
health
of
a
wan
labourer
who
limped
past
the
door
adeline
hid
her
face
with
her
hands
mrs
pemberton
went
on
in
a
lower
tone
of
voice
came
with
some
companions
to
see
thy
mother
grounds
and
to
hear
the
nightingales
in
her
groves
but
here
mrs
pemberton
voice
faltered
have
seen
a
sight
far
beyond
that
of
the
proudest
mansion
said
i
to
those
who
asked
me
of
thy
mother
seat
i
have
heard
what
was
sweeter
to
my
ear
than
the
voice
of
the
nightingale
i
have
seen
a
blooming
girl
nursed
in
idleness
and
prosperity
yet
active
in
the
discharge
of
every
christian
duty
and
i
have
heard
her
speak
in
the
soothing
accents
of
kindness
and
of
pity
while
her
name
was
followed
by
blessings
and
parents
prayed
to
have
a
child
like
her
o
lost
unhappy
girl
such
adeline
mowbray
and
often
very
often
has
thy
graceful
image
recurred
to
my
remembrance
but
how
art
thou
changed
where
is
the
open
eye
of
happiness
where
is
the
bloom
that
spoke
a
heart
at
peace
with
itself
i
repeat
it
and
i
repeat
it
with
agony
father
of
mercies
is
this
thy
adeline
mowbray
here
overcome
with
emotion
mrs
pemberton
paused
but
adeline
could
not
break
silence
she
rose
she
stretched
out
her
hand
as
if
going
to
speak
but
her
utterance
failed
her
and
again
she
sunk
on
a
chair
was
thine
resumed
mrs
pemberton
in
a
faint
and
broken
voice
diffuse
happiness
around
thee
and
to
enjoy
wealth
unhated
because
thy
hand
dispensed
nobly
the
riches
which
it
had
received
bounteously
when
the
ear
heard
thee
then
it
blessed
thee
when
the
eye
saw
thee
it
gave
witness
to
thee
and
yet
here
again
she
paused
and
raised
her
fine
eyes
to
heaven
for
a
few
minutes
as
if
in
prayer
then
pressing
adeline
hand
with
an
almost
convulsive
grasp
she
drew
her
bonnet
over
her
face
as
if
eager
to
hide
the
emotion
which
she
was
unable
to
subdue
and
suddenly
left
the
house
while
adeline
stunned
and
overwhelmed
by
the
striking
contrast
which
mrs
pemberton
had
drawn
between
her
past
and
present
situation
remained
for
some
minutes
motionless
on
her
seat
a
prey
to
a
variety
of
feelings
which
she
dared
not
venture
to
analyse
but
amidst
the
variety
of
her
feelings
adeline
soon
found
that
sorrow
sorrow
of
the
bitterest
kind
was
uppermost
mrs
pemberton
had
said
that
she
was
about
to
be
visited
by
affliction
alluding
there
was
no
doubt
to
the
probable
death
of
glenmurray
and
was
his
fate
so
certain
that
it
was
the
theme
of
conversation
at
richmond
were
only
eyes
blind
to
the
certainty
of
his
danger
on
these
ideas
did
adeline
chiefly
dwell
after
the
departure
of
her
monitress
and
in
an
agony
unspeakable
she
entered
the
room
where
glenmurray
was
sitting
in
order
to
look
at
him
and
form
her
own
judgment
on
a
subject
of
such
importance
but
alas
she
found
him
with
the
brilliant
deceitful
appearance
that
attends
his
complaint
a
bloom
resembling
health
on
his
cheek
and
a
brightness
in
his
eye
rivalling
that
of
the
undimmed
lustre
of
youth
surprised
delighted
and
overcome
by
these
appearances
which
her
inexperience
rendered
her
incapable
of
appreciating
justly
adeline
threw
herself
on
the
sofa
by
him
and
as
she
pressed
her
cold
cheek
to
his
glowing
one
her
tearful
eye
was
raised
to
heaven
with
an
expression
of
devout
thankfulness
pemberton
paid
you
a
long
visit
said
glenmurray
i
thought
once
by
the
elevated
tone
of
her
voice
that
she
was
preaching
to
you
believe
she
was
cheerfully
replied
adeline
now
i
have
a
confession
to
make
the
season
of
reserve
shall
be
over
and
i
will
tell
you
all
the
adventures
of
this
day
without
i
thought
you
were
not
ingenuous
with
me
this
morning
replied
glenmurray
better
late
than
never
adeline
then
told
him
all
that
had
passed
between
her
and
mary
and
mrs
pemberton
and
concluded
with
saying
the
surety
of
your
better
health
which
your
looks
give
me
has
dissipated
every
uneasiness
and
if
you
are
but
spared
to
me
sorrow
can
not
reach
me
and
i
despise
the
censure
of
the
ignorant
and
the
prejudiced
the
world
approve
what
is
the
world
to
me
conscious
mind
is
its
own
awful
world
glenmurray
sighed
deeply
as
she
concluded
her
narration
have
only
one
request
to
make
said
he
let
that
mary
come
into
my
presence
again
and
be
sure
to
take
care
of
mrs
address
adeline
promised
that
both
his
requests
should
be
attended
to
mary
was
paid
her
wages
and
dismissed
immediately
and
a
girl
being
hired
to
supply
her
place
the
ménage
went
on
quietly
again
but
a
new
mortification
awaited
glenmurray
and
adeline
in
spite
of
glenmurray
eccentricities
and
opinions
he
was
still
remembered
with
interest
by
some
of
the
female
part
of
his
family
and
two
of
his
cousins
more
remarkable
for
their
beauty
than
their
virtue
hearing
that
he
was
at
richmond
made
known
to
him
their
intention
of
paying
him
a
morning
visit
on
their
way
to
their
in
the
neighbourhood
unwelcome
visitors
indeed
cried
glenmurray
throwing
the
letter
down
will
write
to
them
and
forbid
them
to
come
impossible
replied
adeline
by
this
time
they
must
be
on
the
road
if
you
look
at
the
date
of
the
letter
besides
i
wish
you
to
receive
them
i
should
like
to
see
any
relations
or
friends
of
yours
especially
those
who
have
liberality
of
sentiment
enough
to
esteem
you
as
you
deserve
you
see
them
exclaimed
glenmurray
pacing
the
room
impatiently
adeline
that
is
understand
you
replied
adeline
changing
colour
will
not
deem
me
worthy
forcing
a
smile
be
introduced
to
them
therefore
would
i
forbid
their
coming
i
can
not
bear
to
you
from
my
presence
in
order
that
i
may
receive
them
no
when
they
arrive
i
will
send
them
word
that
i
am
unable
to
see
them
they
will
attribute
the
refusal
to
the
influence
of
the
who
lives
with
you
no
glenmurray
for
my
sake
i
must
insist
on
your
not
being
denied
to
them
and
believe
me
i
should
consider
myself
as
unworthy
to
be
the
choice
of
your
heart
if
i
were
not
able
to
bear
with
firmness
a
mortification
like
that
which
awaits
me
you
allow
it
to
be
a
mortification
it
is
mortifying
to
a
woman
who
knows
herself
to
be
virtuous
and
is
an
idolater
of
virtue
to
pay
the
penalty
of
vice
and
be
thought
unworthy
to
associate
with
the
relations
of
the
man
whom
she
loves
shall
not
come
i
protest
exclaimed
glenmurray
but
adeline
was
resolute
and
she
carried
her
point
soon
after
this
conversation
the
ladies
arrived
and
adeline
shut
herself
up
in
her
own
apartment
where
she
gave
way
to
no
very
pleasant
reflections
nor
was
she
entirely
satisfied
with
glenmurray
conduct
true
he
had
earnestly
and
sincerely
wished
to
refuse
to
see
his
unexpected
and
unwelcome
guests
but
he
had
never
once
expressed
a
desire
of
combating
their
prejudices
for
adeline
sake
and
an
intention
of
requesting
that
she
might
be
introduced
to
them
but
as
any
common
man
would
have
done
under
similar
circumstances
he
was
contented
to
do
homage
to
as
they
are
without
an
effort
to
resist
the
prejudice
to
which
he
was
superior
cried
adeline
can
we
hope
to
see
society
enlightened
and
improved
when
even
those
who
see
and
strive
to
amend
its
faults
in
theory
in
practice
tamely
submit
to
the
trammels
which
it
imposes
an
hour
a
tedious
hour
to
adeline
having
elapsed
visitors
departed
and
by
the
disappointment
that
adeline
experienced
at
hearing
the
door
close
on
them
she
felt
that
she
had
had
a
secret
hope
of
being
summoned
to
be
presented
to
them
and
with
a
bitter
feeling
of
mortification
she
reflected
that
she
was
probably
to
the
man
whom
she
adored
a
shame
and
a
reproach
i
should
like
to
see
them
she
said
running
to
the
window
as
the
carriage
drove
up
and
the
ladies
entered
it
at
that
moment
they
whether
from
curiosity
to
see
her
or
accident
looked
up
at
the
window
where
she
was
adeline
started
back
indignant
and
confused
for
thrusting
their
heads
eagerly
forward
they
looked
at
her
with
the
bold
unfeeling
stare
of
imagined
superiority
and
adeline
spite
of
her
reason
sunk
abashed
and
conscious
from
their
gaze
this
insult
exclaimed
she
clasping
her
hands
and
bursting
into
tears
experience
from
glenmurray
i
think
i
could
have
borne
it
better
from
any
one
else
she
had
not
recovered
her
disorder
when
glenmurray
entered
the
room
and
tenderly
embracing
her
exclaimed
never
again
my
love
will
i
submit
to
such
a
sacrifice
as
i
have
now
made
when
seeing
her
in
tears
too
well
aware
of
the
cause
he
gave
way
to
such
a
passionate
burst
of
tenderness
and
regret
that
adeline
terrified
at
his
agitation
though
soothed
by
his
fondness
affected
the
cheerfulness
which
she
did
not
feel
and
promised
to
drive
the
intruders
from
her
remembrance
had
glenmurray
and
adeline
known
the
real
character
of
the
unwelcome
visitors
neither
of
them
would
have
regretted
that
adeline
was
not
presented
to
them
one
of
them
was
married
and
to
so
accommodating
a
husband
that
his
wife
known
gallant
was
his
intimate
friend
and
under
the
sanction
of
his
protection
she
was
received
every
where
and
visited
by
every
one
as
the
world
did
not
think
proper
to
be
more
than
the
husband
himself
chose
to
be
the
other
lady
was
a
young
and
attractive
widow
who
coquetted
with
many
men
but
intrigued
with
only
one
at
a
time
for
which
she
was
rewarded
by
being
allowed
to
pass
unquestioned
through
the
portals
of
fashionable
society
but
these
ladies
would
have
scorned
to
associate
with
adeline
and
adeline
had
she
known
their
private
history
would
certainly
have
returned
the
compliment
the
peace
of
adeline
was
soon
after
disturbed
in
another
way
glenmurray
finding
himself
disposed
to
sleep
in
the
middle
of
the
day
his
cough
having
kept
him
waking
all
night
adeline
took
her
usual
walk
and
returned
by
the
the
bell
was
tolling
and
as
she
passed
she
saw
a
funeral
enter
the
and
instantly
averted
her
head
in
so
doing
her
eyes
fell
on
a
woman
who
with
a
sort
of
angry
earnestness
was
watching
the
progress
of
the
procession
there
goes
your
body
you
rogue
she
exclaimed
indignantly
i
wonder
where
your
soul
is
now
where
i
would
not
be
for
something
adeline
was
shocked
and
gently
observed
crime
did
the
person
of
whom
you
are
speaking
that
you
should
suppose
his
soul
so
painfully
disposed
of
crime
returned
the
woman
enough
i
think
why
he
ruined
a
poor
girl
here
in
the
neighbourhood
and
then
because
he
never
chose
to
make
a
will
there
is
she
of
a
little
with
not
a
farthing
of
money
to
maintain
her
or
the
child
and
the
money
is
gone
to
the
scarce
of
kin
to
him
while
his
own
flesh
and
blood
is
left
to
starve
adeline
shuddered
if
glenmurray
were
to
die
she
and
the
child
which
she
bore
would
she
knew
be
beggars
miss
or
madam
belike
by
the
look
of
you
continued
the
woman
glancing
her
eye
over
adeline
person
say
you
do
you
think
the
fellow
soul
is
where
we
should
not
like
to
be
however
he
had
his
hell
here
too
to
be
sure
for
when
speechless
and
unable
to
move
his
fingers
he
seemed
by
signs
to
ask
for
pen
and
ink
and
he
looked
in
agonies
and
there
was
the
poor
young
woman
crying
over
him
and
holding
in
her
arms
the
poor
destitute
baby
who
would
as
he
grew
up
be
taught
he
must
think
to
curse
the
wicked
father
who
begot
him
and
the
naughty
mother
who
bore
him
adeline
turned
very
sick
and
was
forced
to
seat
herself
on
a
tombstone
the
mother
who
bore
him
she
inwardly
repeated
will
my
child
curse
me
rather
let
me
undergo
the
rites
i
have
despised
and
instantly
starting
from
her
seat
she
ran
down
the
road
to
her
lodgings
resolving
to
propose
to
glenmurray
their
immediate
marriage
is
the
possession
of
property
then
she
said
to
herself
as
she
stopped
to
take
breath
supreme
a
good
that
the
want
of
it
through
the
means
of
his
mother
should
dispose
a
child
to
curse
that
mother
no
my
child
shall
be
taught
to
consider
nothing
valuable
but
virtue
nothing
disgraceful
but
fool
that
i
am
a
bugbear
frightened
me
and
to
my
foolish
fears
i
was
about
to
sacrifice
my
own
principles
and
the
respectability
of
glenmurray
no
let
his
property
go
to
the
let
me
be
forced
to
labour
to
support
my
babe
when
its
father
here
a
flood
of
tears
put
an
end
to
her
soliloquy
and
slowly
and
pensively
she
returned
home
but
the
conversation
of
the
woman
in
the
haunted
her
while
waking
and
continued
to
distress
her
in
her
dreams
that
night
and
she
was
resolved
to
do
all
she
could
to
relieve
the
situation
of
the
poor
destitute
girl
and
child
in
whose
fate
she
might
possibly
see
an
anticipation
of
her
own
and
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
and
glenmurray
was
engaged
in
his
studies
she
walked
out
to
make
the
projected
inquiries
the
season
of
the
year
was
uncommonly
fine
and
the
varied
scenery
visible
from
the
terrace
was
at
the
moment
of
adeline
approach
to
it
glowing
with
more
than
common
beauty
adeline
stood
for
some
minutes
gazing
on
it
in
silent
delight
when
her
reverie
was
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
boyish
merriment
and
she
saw
at
one
end
of
the
terrace
some
boys
at
play
regardless
of
their
doom
the
little
victims
play
immediately
recurred
to
her
for
contemplating
the
probable
evils
of
existence
she
was
darkly
brooding
over
the
imagined
fate
of
her
own
offspring
should
it
live
to
see
the
light
and
the
children
at
their
sport
having
no
care
of
ills
to
come
naturally
engaged
her
attention
but
these
happy
children
ceased
to
interest
her
when
she
saw
standing
at
a
distance
from
the
group
and
apparently
looking
at
it
with
an
eye
of
envy
a
little
boy
even
better
dressed
than
the
rest
who
was
sobbing
violently
yet
evidently
trying
to
conceal
his
grief
and
while
she
was
watching
the
young
mourner
attentively
he
suddenly
threw
himself
on
a
seat
and
taking
out
his
handkerchief
indignantly
and
impatiently
wiped
away
the
tears
that
would
no
longer
be
restrained
child
thought
adeline
seating
herself
beside
him
has
affliction
reached
thee
so
soon
the
child
was
beautiful
and
his
clustering
locks
seemed
to
have
been
combed
with
so
much
care
the
frill
of
his
shirt
was
so
fine
and
had
been
so
very
neatly
plaited
and
his
neck
and
hands
were
so
very
very
clean
that
adeline
was
certain
he
was
the
darling
object
of
some
fond
mother
attention
yet
he
is
unhappy
she
inwardly
exclaimed
my
fate
resembled
his
how
happy
i
was
but
from
the
recollections
like
these
she
always
hastened
and
checking
the
rising
sigh
she
resolved
to
enter
into
conversation
with
the
little
boy
is
the
matter
she
no
answer
are
you
not
playing
with
the
young
gentlemen
yonder
she
had
touched
the
right
string
and
bursting
into
tears
he
sobbed
out
they
wo
let
me
and
why
will
they
not
let
you
to
this
he
replied
not
but
sullenly
hung
his
blushing
face
on
his
bosom
you
have
made
them
angry
gently
asked
adeline
no
no
cried
the
boy
what
here
he
turned
from
her
and
with
his
nail
began
scratching
the
arm
of
the
seat
this
is
very
strange
and
seems
very
unkind
cried
adeline
will
speak
to
them
so
saying
she
drew
near
the
other
children
who
had
interrupted
their
play
to
watch
adeline
and
their
rejected
playmate
can
be
the
reason
said
she
you
will
not
let
that
little
boy
play
with
you
the
boys
looked
down
and
said
nothing
he
he
not
play
fair
you
like
him
why
do
you
make
him
unhappy
by
not
letting
him
join
in
your
sport
the
lady
jack
cries
one
and
jack
the
biggest
boy
of
the
party
said
he
is
not
a
gentleman
son
like
us
and
is
only
a
little
bastard
cried
one
of
the
other
children
his
mamma
is
so
proud
she
dresses
him
finer
than
we
are
for
all
he
is
and
our
papas
and
mammas
do
think
him
fit
company
for
us
they
might
have
gone
on
for
an
hour
adeline
could
not
interrupt
them
the
cause
of
the
child
affliction
was
a
dagger
in
her
heart
and
while
she
listened
to
the
now
redoubled
sobs
of
the
disgraced
and
proudly
afflicted
boy
she
was
driven
almost
to
phrensy
for
she
exclaimed
one
time
or
other
be
the
pangs
of
my
child
and
so
to
him
may
the
hours
of
childhood
be
embittered
again
she
seated
herself
by
the
little
mourner
and
her
tears
accompanied
his
dear
child
you
had
better
go
home
said
she
struggling
with
her
feelings
mother
will
certainly
be
glad
of
your
company
i
wo
go
to
her
i
do
love
her
they
say
she
is
a
bad
woman
and
my
papa
a
bad
man
because
they
are
not
married
again
adeline
horrors
returned
my
dear
they
love
you
no
doubt
and
you
ought
to
love
them
she
replied
with
effort
there
comes
your
papa
cried
one
of
the
boys
and
cry
to
him
go
at
these
words
adeline
looked
up
and
saw
an
man
approaching
with
a
look
of
anxiety
my
dear
boy
what
has
happened
said
he
taking
his
hand
which
the
boy
sullenly
withdrew
home
directly
continued
his
father
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
as
we
go
along
but
again
snatching
his
hand
away
the
proud
and
deeply
wounded
child
resentfully
pushed
the
shoulder
next
him
forward
whenever
his
father
tried
to
take
his
arm
and
elbowed
him
angrily
as
he
went
adeline
felt
the
child
action
to
the
bottom
of
her
heart
it
was
a
volume
of
reproach
to
the
father
and
she
sighed
to
think
what
the
parents
if
they
had
hearts
must
feel
when
the
afflicted
boy
told
the
cause
of
his
grief
unhappy
boy
perhaps
my
child
may
live
to
bless
you
she
exclaimed
clasping
her
hands
together
never
will
i
expose
my
child
to
the
pangs
which
you
have
experienced
so
saying
she
returned
instantly
to
her
lodgings
and
having
just
strength
left
to
enter
glenmurray
room
she
faintly
exclaimed
pity
sake
make
me
your
wife
and
fell
senseless
on
the
floor
on
her
recovery
she
saw
glenmurray
pale
with
agitation
yet
with
an
expression
of
satisfaction
in
his
countenance
bending
over
her
my
dearest
love
he
whispered
as
her
head
lay
on
his
bosom
be
the
words
you
have
spoken
whatever
be
their
cause
you
shall
be
my
wife
then
our
child
will
be
legitimate
will
he
not
she
eagerly
replied
will
god
cried
adeline
and
relapsed
into
a
fainting
fit
for
it
was
not
decreed
that
the
object
of
her
maternal
solicitude
should
ever
be
born
to
reward
it
anxiety
and
agitation
had
had
a
fatal
effect
on
the
health
of
adeline
and
the
day
after
her
encounter
on
the
terrace
she
brought
forth
a
dead
child
as
soon
as
adeline
languid
and
disappointed
was
able
to
leave
her
room
glenmurray
whom
anxiety
during
her
illness
had
rendered
considerably
weaker
urged
her
to
let
the
marriage
ceremony
be
performed
immediately
but
with
her
hopes
of
being
a
mother
vanished
her
wishes
to
become
a
wife
and
all
her
former
reasons
against
marriage
recurred
in
their
full
force
in
vain
did
glenmurray
entreat
her
to
keep
her
lately
formed
resolution
she
still
attributed
his
persuasions
to
generosity
and
the
heroic
resolve
of
sacrificing
his
principles
with
the
consistency
of
his
character
to
her
supposed
good
and
it
was
a
point
of
honour
with
her
to
be
as
generous
in
return
consequently
the
subject
was
again
dropped
nor
was
it
likely
to
be
soon
renewed
and
anxiety
of
a
more
pressing
nature
disturbed
their
peace
and
engrossed
their
attention
they
had
been
three
months
at
richmond
and
had
incurred
there
a
considerable
debt
and
glenmurray
not
having
sufficient
money
with
him
to
discharge
it
drew
upon
his
banker
for
half
the
rents
from
his
estate
which
he
had
just
deposited
in
his
hands
when
to
his
unspeakable
astonishment
he
found
that
the
house
had
stopped
payment
and
that
the
principal
partner
had
gone
off
with
the
deposits
scarcely
could
the
firm
mind
of
glenmurray
support
itself
under
the
stroke
he
looked
forward
to
the
certainty
of
passing
the
little
remainder
of
his
life
not
only
in
pain
but
in
poverty
and
of
seeing
increase
as
fast
as
his
wants
the
difficulty
of
supplying
them
while
the
woman
of
his
heart
bent
in
increased
agony
over
his
restless
couch
for
he
well
knew
that
to
raise
money
on
his
estate
or
to
anticipate
the
next
rents
was
impossible
as
he
had
only
a
life
interest
in
it
and
as
he
held
the
fatal
letter
in
his
hand
his
frame
shook
with
agitation
could
not
have
believed
cried
adeline
the
loss
of
any
sum
of
money
could
have
so
violently
affected
you
the
loss
of
my
all
my
support
during
the
tedious
scenes
of
illness
all
faltered
out
adeline
and
when
she
heard
the
true
state
of
the
case
she
found
her
agitation
equalled
that
of
glenmurray
and
in
hopeless
anguish
she
leaned
on
the
table
beside
him
is
to
be
done
said
she
the
next
rents
become
due
where
can
we
procure
money
the
next
rents
become
due
replied
he
looking
at
her
mournfully
shall
not
be
distressed
for
money
then
answered
adeline
not
understanding
him
expenses
have
never
yet
been
more
than
that
sum
can
supply
glenmurray
looked
at
her
and
seeing
how
unconscious
she
was
of
the
certainty
of
the
evil
that
awaited
her
had
not
the
courage
to
distress
her
by
explaining
his
meaning
and
she
went
on
to
ask
him
what
steps
he
meant
to
take
to
raise
money
only
resource
said
he
dunning
a
near
relation
of
mine
who
owes
me
three
hundred
pounds
he
is
now
i
believe
able
to
pay
it
he
is
in
holland
indeed
at
present
but
he
is
daily
expected
in
england
and
will
come
to
see
me
here
i
have
named
him
to
you
before
i
believe
his
name
is
berrendale
it
was
then
agreed
that
glenmurray
should
write
to
mr
berrendale
immediately
and
that
to
prevent
the
necessity
of
incurring
a
further
debt
for
present
provisions
and
necessaries
some
of
their
books
and
linen
should
be
sold
but
week
after
week
elapsed
and
no
letter
was
received
from
mr
berrendale
glenmurray
grew
rapidly
worse
and
their
landlord
was
clamorous
for
his
rent
advice
from
london
also
became
necessary
to
quiet
mind
though
glenmurray
knew
that
he
was
past
cure
and
after
she
had
paid
a
small
sum
to
quiet
the
demands
of
the
landlord
for
a
while
she
had
scarcely
enough
left
to
pay
a
physician
however
she
sent
for
one
recommended
by
dr
norberry
and
by
selling
a
inlaid
with
silver
which
she
valued
because
it
was
the
gift
of
her
father
she
raised
money
sufficient
for
the
occasion
arrived
but
not
to
speak
peace
to
the
mind
of
adeline
she
saw
though
he
did
not
absolutely
say
so
that
all
chance
of
glenmurray
recovery
was
over
and
though
with
the
sanguine
feelings
of
nineteen
she
could
though
hope
were
lost
when
she
watched
countenance
as
he
turned
from
the
of
glenmurray
she
felt
the
coldness
of
despair
thrill
through
her
frame
and
scarcely
able
to
stand
she
followed
him
into
the
next
room
and
awaited
his
orders
with
a
sort
of
desperate
tranquillity
after
prescribing
alleviations
of
the
ill
beyond
his
power
to
cure
added
that
terrible
confirmation
of
the
fears
of
anxious
affection
him
have
whatever
he
likes
nothing
can
hurt
him
now
and
all
your
endeavours
must
be
to
make
the
remaining
hours
of
his
existence
as
comfortable
as
you
can
by
every
indulgence
possible
and
indeed
my
dear
madam
he
continued
must
be
prepared
for
the
trial
that
awaits
you
did
you
say
cried
adeline
in
the
broken
voice
of
tearless
and
almost
phrensied
sorrow
god
if
he
must
die
in
mercy
let
me
die
with
him
if
i
have
sinned
here
she
fell
on
her
knees
surely
the
agony
of
this
moment
is
atonement
sufficient
greatly
affected
raised
her
from
the
ground
and
conjured
her
for
the
sake
of
glenmurray
and
that
she
might
not
make
his
last
hours
miserable
to
bear
her
trial
with
more
fortitude
can
you
talk
of
his
last
hours
and
yet
expect
me
to
be
composed
o
sir
say
but
there
is
one
little
little
gleam
of
hope
for
me
and
i
will
be
calm
replied
be
mistaken
mr
glenmurray
is
young
and
and
here
his
voice
faltered
and
he
was
unable
to
proceed
for
the
expression
of
adeline
countenance
changing
as
it
instantly
did
from
misery
to
joy
joy
of
which
he
knew
the
fallacy
while
her
eyes
were
intently
fixed
on
him
was
too
much
for
a
man
of
any
feeling
to
support
and
when
she
pressed
his
hand
in
the
convulsive
emotions
of
her
gratitude
he
was
forced
to
turn
away
his
head
to
conceal
the
starting
tear
i
may
be
mistaken
mr
glenmurray
is
young
adeline
repeated
again
and
again
as
his
carriage
drove
off
and
she
flew
to
to
impart
to
him
the
satisfaction
which
he
rejoiced
to
see
her
feel
but
in
which
he
could
not
share
her
recovered
security
did
not
however
last
long
the
change
in
glenmurray
grew
every
day
more
visible
and
to
increase
her
distress
they
were
forced
to
avoid
disagreeable
altercations
to
give
the
landlord
a
draft
on
mr
berrendale
for
the
sum
due
to
him
and
remove
to
very
humble
lodgings
in
a
closer
part
of
the
town
here
their
misery
was
a
little
alleviated
by
the
unexpected
receipt
of
twenty
pounds
sent
to
glenmurray
by
a
tenant
who
was
in
arrears
to
him
which
enabled
adeline
to
procure
glenmurray
every
thing
that
his
capricious
appetite
required
and
at
his
earnest
entreaty
in
order
that
she
might
sometimes
venture
to
leave
him
lest
her
health
should
suffer
she
hired
a
nurse
to
assist
her
in
her
attendance
upon
him
a
hasty
letter
too
was
at
length
received
from
mr
berrendale
saying
that
he
should
very
soon
be
in
england
and
should
hasten
to
richmond
immediately
on
his
landing
the
terror
of
wanting
money
therefore
began
to
subside
but
day
after
day
elapsed
and
mr
berrendale
came
not
and
adeline
being
obliged
to
deny
herself
almost
necessary
sustenance
that
glenmurray
appetite
might
be
tempted
and
his
nurse
by
the
indulgence
of
hers
kept
in
good
humour
resolved
presuming
on
the
arrival
of
mr
berrendale
to
write
to
dr
norberry
and
solicit
the
loan
of
twenty
pounds
having
done
so
she
ceased
to
be
alarmed
though
she
found
herself
in
possession
of
only
three
guineas
to
defray
the
probable
expenses
of
the
ensuing
week
and
in
somewhat
less
misery
than
usual
she
at
the
earnest
entreaty
of
glenmurray
set
out
to
take
a
walk
scarcely
conscious
what
she
did
she
strolled
through
the
town
and
seeing
some
fine
grapes
at
the
window
of
a
fruiterer
she
went
in
to
ask
the
price
of
them
knowing
how
welcome
fruit
was
to
the
feverish
palate
of
glenmurray
while
the
shopman
was
weighing
the
grapes
she
saw
a
on
the
counter
and
felt
a
strong
wish
to
carry
it
home
as
a
more
welcome
present
but
with
unspeakable
disappointment
she
heard
that
the
price
of
it
was
two
guineas
a
sum
which
she
could
not
think
herself
justified
in
expending
in
the
present
state
of
their
finances
even
to
please
glenmurray
especially
as
he
had
not
expressed
a
wish
for
such
an
indulgence
besides
he
liked
grapes
and
as
medicine
neither
of
them
could
be
effectual
it
was
fortunate
for
adeline
feelings
that
she
had
not
overheard
what
the
mistress
of
the
shop
said
to
her
maid
as
she
left
it
should
have
asked
another
person
only
a
guinea
but
as
those
sort
of
women
never
mind
what
they
give
i
asked
two
and
i
dare
say
she
will
come
back
for
it
have
brought
you
some
grapes
cried
adeline
as
she
entered
glenmurray
chamber
i
would
have
brought
you
a
but
that
it
was
too
dear
said
glenmurray
languidly
turning
over
the
grapes
and
with
a
sort
of
distaste
putting
one
of
them
in
his
mouth
i
wish
you
had
brought
it
with
all
my
heart
i
protest
that
i
feel
as
if
i
could
eat
a
whole
one
replied
adeline
you
would
enjoy
it
so
much
you
certainly
ought
to
have
it
the
price
my
dear
girl
what
was
it
two
guineas
replied
adeline
forcing
a
smile
guineas
exclaimed
glenmurray
that
is
too
much
to
give
i
will
not
indulge
my
appetite
at
such
a
rate
but
take
away
the
grapes
i
ca
eat
them
adeline
disappointed
removed
them
from
his
sight
and
to
increase
her
vexation
glenmurray
was
continually
talking
of
and
in
that
way
that
showed
how
strongly
his
diseased
appetite
wished
to
enjoy
the
gratification
of
eating
one
at
last
unable
to
bear
to
see
him
struggling
with
an
ungratified
wish
she
told
him
that
she
believed
they
could
afford
to
buy
the
as
she
had
written
to
borrow
some
money
of
dr
norberry
to
be
paid
as
soon
as
mr
berrendale
arrived
in
a
moment
the
dull
eye
of
glenmurray
lighted
up
with
expectation
and
he
who
in
health
was
remarkable
for
and
temperance
scrupled
not
overcome
by
the
influence
of
the
fever
which
consumed
him
to
gratify
his
palate
at
a
rate
the
most
extravagant
adeline
sighed
as
she
contemplated
this
change
effected
by
illness
and
promising
to
be
back
as
soon
as
possible
she
proceeded
to
a
shop
to
dispose
of
her
lace
veil
the
only
ornament
which
she
had
retained
and
that
not
from
vanity
but
because
it
concealed
from
the
eye
of
curiosity
the
sorrow
marked
on
her
countenance
but
she
knew
a
piece
of
muslin
would
do
as
well
and
for
two
guineas
sold
a
veil
worth
treble
that
sum
but
it
was
to
give
a
minute
pleasure
to
glenmurray
and
that
was
enough
for
adeline
on
her
way
to
the
fruiterer
she
saw
a
crowd
at
the
door
of
a
house
and
in
the
midst
of
it
she
beheld
a
mulatto
woman
the
picture
of
sickness
and
despair
supporting
a
young
man
who
seemed
ready
to
faint
every
moment
but
whom
a
man
regardless
of
his
weakness
was
trying
to
force
from
the
grasp
of
the
unhappy
woman
while
a
mulatto
boy
known
in
richmond
by
the
name
of
the
tawny
boy
to
whom
adeline
had
often
given
halfpence
in
her
walks
was
crying
bitterly
and
hiding
his
face
in
the
poor
woman
apron
adeline
immediately
pressed
forward
to
inquire
into
the
cause
of
a
distress
only
too
congenial
to
her
feelings
and
as
she
did
so
the
tawny
boy
looked
up
and
knowing
her
immediately
ran
eagerly
forward
to
meet
her
seeming
though
he
did
not
speak
to
associate
with
her
presence
an
idea
of
certain
relief
it
is
only
a
poor
man
replied
an
old
woman
in
answer
to
inquiries
ca
pay
his
debts
and
so
they
are
dragging
him
to
prison
that
all
are
dragging
him
to
his
death
too
cried
a
younger
woman
in
a
gentle
accent
he
is
only
just
recovering
from
a
bad
fever
and
if
he
goes
to
jail
the
bad
air
will
certainly
kill
him
poor
soul
that
his
wife
said
adeline
and
my
mammy
said
the
tawny
boy
looking
up
in
her
face
she
so
ill
and
sorry
unhappy
creatures
replied
her
informant
they
have
known
great
trouble
and
now
just
as
they
had
got
a
little
money
together
william
fell
ill
and
in
doctor
stuff
savanna
that
the
name
has
spent
all
the
money
she
had
earned
as
well
as
her
husband
and
now
she
is
ill
herself
and
i
am
sure
william
going
to
jail
will
kill
her
and
a
wicked
wretch
mr
davis
is
to
arrest
him
that
he
is
not
but
what
it
is
his
due
i
can
not
say
but
it
is
but
poor
souls
he
die
and
she
die
and
then
what
will
become
of
their
poor
little
boy
the
tawny
boy
all
this
time
was
standing
crying
by
adeline
side
and
had
twisted
his
fingers
in
her
gown
while
her
heart
sympathized
most
painfully
in
the
anguish
of
the
mulatto
woman
is
the
amount
of
the
sum
for
which
he
is
taken
up
said
adeline
trifling
but
mr
davis
owes
him
a
grudge
and
so
will
not
wait
any
longer
it
is
in
all
only
ten
pounds
and
he
says
if
they
will
pay
part
he
will
wait
for
the
rest
but
then
he
knows
they
could
as
well
pay
all
as
part
adeline
shocked
at
the
knowledge
of
a
distress
which
she
was
not
able
to
remove
was
turning
away
as
the
woman
said
this
when
she
felt
that
the
little
boy
pulled
her
gown
gently
as
if
appealing
to
her
generosity
while
a
man
who
was
the
creditor
himself
forcing
a
passage
through
the
crowd
said
bring
him
along
and
have
done
with
it
here
is
a
fuss
to
make
indeed
about
that
idle
dog
and
that
ugly
black
toad
adeline
till
then
had
not
recollected
that
she
was
a
mulatto
and
this
speech
reflecting
so
brutally
on
her
colour
a
circumstance
which
made
her
an
object
of
greater
interest
to
adeline
urged
her
to
step
forward
to
their
joint
relief
with
an
almost
irresistible
impulse
especially
when
another
man
reproached
the
fellow
for
his
brutality
and
added
that
he
knew
them
both
to
be
deserving
persons
but
to
disappoint
glenmurray
of
his
promised
pleasure
was
impossible
and
having
put
sixpence
in
the
tawny
boy
hand
she
was
hastening
to
the
fruiterer
when
the
crowd
who
were
following
william
and
the
mulatto
to
the
jail
whither
the
bailiffs
were
dragging
rather
than
leading
him
fell
back
to
give
air
to
the
poor
man
who
had
fainted
on
shoulder
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
expiring
while
she
with
an
expression
of
fixed
despair
was
gazing
on
his
wan
cheek
adeline
thought
on
glenmurray
danger
and
shuddered
as
she
beheld
the
scene
she
felt
it
but
a
too
probable
anticipation
of
the
one
in
which
she
might
soon
be
an
actor
at
this
moment
a
man
observed
he
goes
to
prison
he
will
not
live
two
days
that
every
one
may
see
and
the
mulatto
uttered
a
shriek
of
agony
adeline
felt
it
to
her
very
soul
and
rushing
forward
sir
she
exclaimed
to
the
unfeeling
creditor
i
were
to
give
you
a
guinea
now
and
promise
you
two
more
a
fortnight
hence
would
you
release
this
poor
man
for
the
present
i
must
have
three
guineas
this
moment
replied
he
adeline
sighed
and
withdrew
her
hand
from
her
pocket
were
glenmurray
here
he
would
give
up
his
indulgence
i
am
sure
to
save
the
lives
of
probably
two
thought
adeline
he
would
not
forgive
me
if
i
were
to
sacrifice
such
an
opportunity
to
the
sole
gratification
of
his
palate
but
then
again
glenmurray
eagerly
expecting
her
with
the
promised
treat
so
gratifying
to
the
feverish
taste
of
sickness
seemed
to
appear
before
her
and
she
turned
away
but
the
eyes
of
the
mulatto
who
had
heard
her
words
and
had
hung
on
them
breathless
with
expectation
followed
her
with
a
look
of
such
sad
reproach
for
the
disappointment
which
she
had
occasioned
her
and
the
little
boy
looked
up
so
wistfully
in
her
face
crying
fader
and
poor
mammy
that
adeline
could
not
withstand
the
force
of
the
appeal
but
almost
exclaiming
would
upbraid
me
if
i
did
not
act
thus
she
gave
the
creditor
the
three
guineas
paid
the
bailiffs
their
demand
and
then
made
her
way
through
the
crowd
who
respectfully
drew
back
to
give
her
room
to
pass
saying
bless
you
lady
god
bless
you
but
william
was
too
ill
and
savanna
felt
too
much
to
speak
and
the
surly
creditor
said
sneeringly
i
had
been
you
i
would
at
least
have
thanked
the
lady
this
reproach
restored
savanna
to
the
use
of
speech
and
but
with
a
violent
effort
she
uttered
in
a
hoarse
and
broken
voice
tank
her
god
tank
her
i
never
can
and
adeline
kindly
pressing
her
hand
hurried
away
from
her
in
silence
though
scarcely
able
to
refrain
exclaiming
know
not
the
sacrifice
which
you
have
cost
me
the
tawny
boy
still
followed
her
as
loath
to
leave
her
bless
you
my
dear
said
she
kindly
to
him
go
to
your
mother
and
be
good
to
her
his
dark
face
glowed
as
she
spoke
to
him
and
holding
up
his
chin
me
cried
he
tawny
boy
love
you
she
did
so
and
then
reluctantly
he
left
her
nodding
his
head
and
saying
bye
till
he
was
out
of
sight
with
him
and
with
the
display
of
his
grateful
joy
vanished
all
that
could
give
adeline
resolution
to
bear
her
own
reflections
at
the
idea
of
returning
home
and
of
the
trial
that
awaited
her
in
vain
did
she
now
try
to
believe
that
glenmurray
would
applaud
what
she
had
he
was
now
the
slave
of
disease
nor
was
it
likely
that
even
his
and
principle
benevolence
could
endure
with
patience
so
cruel
a
disappointment
and
from
the
woman
whom
he
loved
too
and
to
whom
the
indulgence
of
his
slightest
wishes
ought
to
have
been
the
first
object
shall
i
do
cried
she
will
he
say
no
doubt
he
is
impatiently
expecting
me
and
in
his
weak
state
disappointment
may
here
unable
to
hear
her
apprehensions
she
wrung
her
hands
in
agony
and
when
she
arrived
in
sight
of
her
lodgings
she
dared
not
look
up
lest
she
should
see
glenmurray
at
the
window
watching
for
her
return
slowly
and
fearfully
did
she
open
the
door
and
the
first
sound
she
heard
was
glenmurray
voice
from
the
door
of
his
room
saying
you
are
come
at
last
i
have
been
so
impatient
and
indeed
he
had
risen
and
dressed
himself
that
he
might
enjoy
his
treat
more
than
he
could
do
in
a
can
i
bear
to
look
him
in
the
face
thought
adeline
lingering
on
the
stairs
my
love
why
do
you
make
me
wait
so
long
cried
glenmurray
are
knives
and
plates
ready
where
is
the
treat
i
have
been
so
long
expecting
adeline
entered
the
room
and
threw
herself
on
the
first
chair
avoiding
the
sight
of
glenmurray
whose
countenance
as
she
hastily
glanced
her
eyes
over
it
was
animated
with
the
expectation
of
a
pleasure
which
he
was
not
to
enjoy
have
not
brought
the
she
faintly
articulated
replied
glenmurray
hard
upon
me
the
only
thing
for
weeks
that
i
have
wished
for
or
could
have
eaten
with
pleasure
i
suppose
you
were
so
long
going
that
it
was
disposed
of
before
you
got
there
replied
adeline
struggling
with
her
tears
at
this
first
instance
of
pettishness
in
glenmurray
me
the
supposition
replied
glenmurray
recovering
himself
likely
you
met
some
dun
on
the
road
and
so
the
two
guineas
were
disposed
of
another
way
if
so
i
ca
blame
you
what
say
you
am
i
right
how
was
it
gravely
asked
glenmurray
must
have
had
a
very
powerful
and
a
sufficient
reason
to
induce
you
to
disappoint
a
poor
invalid
of
the
indulgence
which
you
had
yourself
excited
him
to
wish
for
is
terrible
indeed
thought
adeline
never
was
i
so
tempted
to
tell
a
falsehood
silent
you
are
very
unkind
miss
mowbray
said
glenmurray
see
that
i
have
tired
even
out
these
words
by
the
agony
which
they
excited
restored
to
adeline
all
her
resolution
she
ran
to
glenmurray
she
clasped
his
burning
hands
in
hers
and
as
succinctly
as
possible
she
related
what
had
passed
when
she
had
finished
glenmurray
was
silent
the
fretfulness
of
disease
prompted
him
to
say
then
to
the
relief
of
strangers
you
sacrificed
the
gratification
of
the
man
whom
you
love
and
deprived
him
of
the
only
pleasure
he
may
live
to
enjoy
but
the
habitual
sweetness
and
generosity
of
his
temper
struggled
and
struggled
effectually
with
his
malady
and
while
adeline
pale
and
trembling
awaited
her
sentence
he
caught
her
suddenly
to
his
bosom
and
held
her
there
a
few
moments
in
silence
you
forgive
me
faltered
out
adeline
you
i
love
and
admire
you
more
than
ever
i
know
your
heart
adeline
and
i
am
convinced
that
depriving
yourself
of
the
delight
of
giving
me
the
promised
treat
in
order
to
do
a
benevolent
action
was
an
effort
of
virtue
of
the
highest
order
and
never
i
trust
have
you
known
or
will
you
know
again
such
bitter
feelings
as
you
this
moment
experienced
adeline
gratified
by
his
generous
kindness
and
charmed
with
his
praise
could
only
weep
her
thanks
now
said
glenmurray
laughing
may
bring
back
the
grapes
i
am
not
like
sterne
dear
jenny
if
i
can
not
get
i
will
not
insist
on
eating
crab
the
grapes
were
brought
but
in
vain
did
he
try
to
eat
them
at
this
time
however
he
did
not
send
them
away
without
highly
commending
their
flavour
and
wishing
that
he
dared
give
way
to
his
inclinations
and
feast
upon
them
god
of
mercy
cried
adeline
bursting
into
an
agony
of
grief
as
she
reached
her
own
apartment
and
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
by
the
that
benevolent
being
be
taken
from
me
for
ever
and
must
i
must
i
survive
him
she
continued
for
some
minutes
in
this
attitude
and
with
her
heart
devoutly
raised
to
heaven
till
every
feeling
yielded
to
resignation
and
she
arose
calm
if
not
contented
when
on
turning
round
she
saw
glenmurray
leaning
against
the
door
and
gazing
on
her
enthusiast
cried
he
smiling
thus
when
you
are
distressed
you
seek
consolation
do
she
replied
wouldst
thou
wish
to
deprive
me
of
it
by
heaven
warmly
exclaimed
glenmurray
and
the
evening
passed
more
cheerfully
than
usual
the
next
post
brought
a
letter
not
from
norberry
but
from
his
wife
it
was
as
follows
and
contained
three
norberry
compliments
to
miss
mowbray
having
opened
her
letter
poor
dr
norberry
being
dangerously
ill
of
a
fever
find
her
distress
of
which
shall
not
inform
the
doctor
as
he
feels
so
much
for
his
friend
misfortunes
specially
when
brought
on
by
misconduct
but
out
of
respect
for
your
mother
who
is
a
good
sort
of
woman
though
rather
particular
as
all
learned
ladies
are
have
sent
three
the
miss
norberrys
giving
one
not
to
lend
but
a
gift
and
they
join
mrs
norberry
in
hoping
miss
mowbray
will
soon
see
the
error
of
her
ways
and
if
so
be
no
doubt
dr
norberry
will
use
his
interest
to
get
her
into
the
magdalen
this
curious
epistle
would
have
excited
in
glenmurray
and
adeline
no
other
feelings
save
those
of
contempt
but
for
the
information
it
contained
of
the
doctor
being
dangerously
ill
and
in
fear
for
the
worthy
husband
they
forgot
the
impertinence
of
the
wife
and
daughters
the
next
day
fortunately
mr
berrendale
arrived
and
with
him
the
three
hundred
pounds
consequently
all
glenmurray
debts
were
discharged
better
lodgings
procured
and
the
three
returned
in
a
blank
cover
to
mrs
norberry
charles
berrendale
was
to
glenmurray
and
so
like
him
in
face
that
they
were
at
first
mistaken
for
brothers
but
to
a
physiognomist
they
must
always
have
been
unlike
as
glenmurray
was
remarkable
for
the
character
and
expression
of
his
countenance
and
berrendale
for
the
extreme
beauty
of
his
features
and
complexion
glenmurray
was
pale
and
thin
and
his
eyes
and
hair
dark
berrendale
eyes
were
of
a
light
blue
and
though
his
were
black
his
hair
was
of
a
rich
auburn
glenmurray
was
thin
and
muscular
berrendale
round
and
corpulent
still
they
were
alike
and
it
was
not
ill
observed
of
them
that
berrendale
was
glenmurray
in
good
health
but
berrendale
could
not
be
flattered
by
the
resemblance
as
his
face
and
person
were
so
truly
what
is
called
handsome
that
partial
as
our
sex
is
said
to
be
to
beauty
any
woman
would
have
been
excused
for
falling
in
love
with
him
whether
his
mind
was
equal
to
his
person
we
shall
show
hereafter
the
meeting
between
berrendale
and
glenmurray
was
affectionate
on
both
sides
but
berrendale
could
scarcely
hide
the
pain
he
felt
on
seeing
the
situation
of
glenmurray
whose
virtues
he
had
always
loved
whose
talents
he
had
always
respected
and
to
whose
active
friendship
towards
himself
he
owed
eternal
gratitude
but
he
soon
learnt
to
think
glenmurray
in
one
respect
an
object
of
envy
when
he
beheld
the
constant
skilful
and
tender
attentions
of
his
nurse
and
saw
in
that
nurse
every
gift
of
heart
mind
and
person
which
could
make
a
woman
amiable
berrendale
had
heard
that
his
eccentric
cousin
was
living
with
a
girl
as
odd
as
himself
who
thought
herself
a
genius
and
pretended
to
universal
knowledge
great
then
was
his
astonishment
to
find
this
imagined
pedant
and
pretender
not
only
an
adept
in
every
useful
and
feminine
pursuit
but
modest
in
her
demeanour
and
gentle
in
her
manners
little
did
he
expect
to
see
her
capable
of
serving
the
table
of
glenmurray
with
dishes
made
by
herself
not
only
tempting
to
the
now
craving
appetite
of
the
invalid
but
to
the
palate
of
an
epicure
while
all
his
wants
were
anticipated
by
her
anxious
attention
and
many
of
the
sufferings
of
sickness
alleviated
by
her
inventive
care
adeline
meanwhile
was
agreeably
surprised
to
see
the
good
effect
produced
on
glenmurray
spirits
and
even
his
health
by
the
arrival
of
his
cousin
and
her
manner
became
even
affectionate
to
berrendale
from
gratitude
for
the
change
which
his
presence
seemed
to
have
occasioned
adeline
had
now
a
companion
in
her
occasional
walks
glenmurray
insisted
on
her
walking
and
insisted
on
berrendale
accompanying
her
in
these
adeline
unburthened
her
heart
by
telling
berrendale
of
the
agony
she
felt
at
the
idea
of
losing
glenmurray
and
while
drowned
in
tears
she
leaned
on
his
arm
she
unconsciously
suffered
him
to
press
the
hand
that
leaned
against
him
nor
would
she
have
felt
it
a
freedom
to
be
reproved
had
she
been
conscious
that
he
did
so
but
these
trifling
indulgences
were
fuel
to
the
flame
that
she
had
kindled
in
the
heart
of
berrendale
a
flame
which
he
saw
no
guilt
in
indulging
as
he
looked
on
glenmurray
death
as
certain
and
adeline
would
then
be
free
but
though
adeline
was
perfectly
unconscious
of
his
attachment
glenmurray
had
seen
it
even
before
berrendale
himself
discovered
it
and
he
only
waited
a
favourable
opportunity
to
make
the
discovery
known
to
the
parties
all
he
had
as
yet
ventured
to
say
was
my
adeline
is
an
excellent
nurse
you
would
like
such
as
one
during
your
fits
of
the
gout
and
berrendale
had
blushed
deeply
while
he
assented
to
glenmurray
remarks
because
he
was
conscious
that
while
enumerating
adeline
perfections
he
had
figured
her
to
himself
warming
his
flannels
and
leaning
tenderly
over
his
gouty
couch
one
day
while
adeline
was
reading
to
glenmurray
and
berrendale
was
attending
not
to
what
she
read
but
to
the
beauty
of
her
mouth
while
reading
the
nurse
came
in
and
said
that
mulatto
woman
wished
to
speak
to
miss
mowbray
her
up
immediately
cried
glenmurray
if
her
little
boy
is
with
her
let
him
come
too
in
vain
did
adeline
expostulate
glenmurray
wished
to
enjoy
the
mulatto
expressions
of
gratitude
and
in
spite
of
all
she
could
say
the
mother
and
child
were
introduced
cried
the
mulatto
whose
looks
were
so
improved
that
adeline
scarcely
knew
her
again
me
find
you
at
last
and
please
god
we
not
soon
part
more
as
she
said
this
she
pressed
the
hem
of
gown
to
her
lips
with
fervent
emotion
part
from
her
again
cried
glenmurray
do
you
mean
my
good
woman
when
she
gave
tree
guinea
for
me

tought

dat
great
fat
nurse

gold
wages
and
eat
and
drink
fat
beside
i
knowd
her
well
all
this
was
uttered
with
volubility
and
in
a
tone
between
laughing
and
crying
adeline
said
glenmurray
when
she
had
ended
did
not
throw
away
your
kindness
on
an
unworthy
and
ungrateful
object
so
i
am
quite
reconciled
to
the
loss
of
the
and
i
will
tell
your
honest
friend
here
the
story
to
show
her
as
she
has
a
tender
heart
herself
the
greatness
of
the
sacrifice
you
made
for
her
sake
adeline
begged
him
to
desist
but
he
went
on
and
the
mulatto
could
not
keep
herself
quiet
on
the
chair
while
he
related
the
circumstance
did
she
do
dat
to
save
me
she
passionately
exclaimed
woman
i
should
have
let
poor
man
go
to
prison
before
disappoint
my
william
did
you
forgive
her
immediately
said
berrendale
certainly
that
was
heroic
too
returned
he
no
one
but
glenmurray
would
have
been
so
heroic
i
believe
said
adeline
lady
you
break
my
heart
cried
the
mulatto
you
not
take
my
service
mr
william
and
me
too
poor
to
live
togedder
of
some
year
perhaps
here
child
tawny
boy
down
on
knees
and
vow
wid
me
to
be
faithful
and
grateful
to
this
our
mistress
till
our
last
day
and
never
to
forsake
her
in
sickness
or
in
sorrow
i
swear
dis
to
my
great
god
and
now
say
dat
after
me
she
then
clasped
the
little
hands
bade
him
raise
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
made
him
repeat
what
she
had
said
ending
it
with
swear
dis
to
my
great
god
there
was
such
an
affecting
solemnity
in
this
action
and
in
the
mulatto
such
a
determined
enthusiasm
of
manner
incapable
of
being
controlled
that
adeline
glenmurray
and
berrendale
observed
what
passed
in
respectful
silence
and
when
it
was
over
glenmurray
said
in
a
voice
of
emotion
think
adeline
we
must
accept
this
good
creature
offer
and
as
nurse
grows
lazy
and
saucy
we
had
better
part
with
her
and
as
for
your
young
knight
there
the
tawny
boy
had
by
this
time
nestled
himself
close
to
adeline
who
with
no
small
emotion
was
playing
with
his
woolly
curls
must
send
him
to
school
for
my
good
woman
we
are
not
so
poor
as
you
imagine
be
thanked
cried
the
mulatto
what
is
your
name
was
christened
savanna
replied
she
good
savanna
cried
adeline
hope
we
shall
both
have
reason
to
bless
the
day
when
first
we
met
and
you
shall
come
home
to
us
savanna
on
hearing
this
almost
screamed
with
joy
and
as
she
took
her
leave
berrendale
slipped
a
guinea
into
her
hand
the
tawny
boy
meanwhile
slowly
followed
his
mother
as
if
unwilling
to
leave
adeline
even
though
she
gave
him
halfpence
to
spend
in
cakes
but
on
being
told
that
she
would
let
him
come
again
the
next
day
he
tripped
gaily
down
after
savanna
the
quiet
of
the
chamber
being
then
restored
glenmurray
fell
into
a
calm
slumber
adeline
took
up
her
work
and
berrendale
pretending
to
read
continued
to
feed
his
passion
by
gazing
on
the
unconscious
adeline
while
they
were
thus
engaged
glenmurray
unobserved
awoke
and
he
soon
guessed
how
berrendale
eyes
were
employed
as
the
book
which
he
held
in
his
hand
was
upside
down
and
through
the
fingers
of
the
hand
which
he
held
before
his
face
he
saw
his
looks
fixed
on
adeline
the
moment
was
a
favourable
one
for
glenmurray
purpose
and
just
as
he
raised
himself
from
his
pillow
adeline
had
discovered
the
earnest
gaze
of
berrendale
and
a
suspicion
of
the
truth
that
instant
darting
across
her
mind
disconcerted
and
blushing
she
had
cast
her
eyes
on
the
ground
is
an
interesting
study
which
you
are
engaged
in
charles
cried
glenmurray
smiling
berrendale
started
and
deeply
blushing
faltered
out
adeline
looked
at
glenmurray
and
seeing
a
very
arch
and
meaning
expression
on
his
countenance
suspected
that
he
had
made
the
same
discovery
as
herself
yet
if
so
she
wondered
at
his
looking
so
pleasantly
on
berrendale
as
he
spoke
is
a
book
charles
continued
glenmurray
the
more
you
study
the
more
you
will
admire
and
i
wish
to
give
you
a
clue
to
understand
some
passages
in
it
better
than
you
can
now
do
this
speech
deceived
adeline
and
made
her
suppose
that
glenmurray
really
alluded
to
the
book
which
lay
before
berrendale
but
it
convinced
that
glenmurray
spoke
metaphorically
and
as
his
manner
was
kind
it
also
made
him
think
that
he
saw
and
did
not
disapprove
his
attachment
for
a
few
minutes
each
of
them
being
engrossed
in
different
contemplations
there
was
a
complete
silence
but
glenmurray
interrupted
it
by
saying
dear
adeline
it
is
your
hour
for
walking
but
as
i
am
not
disposed
to
sleep
again
will
you
forgive
me
if
i
keep
your
walking
companion
to
myself
i
wish
to
converse
with
him
alone
most
cheerfully
she
replied
with
quickness
know
i
love
a
solitary
ramble
of
all
things
very
flattering
that
to
my
cousin
observed
glenmurray
did
not
wish
to
flatter
him
said
adeline
gravely
and
berrendale
fluttered
at
the
idea
of
the
coming
conversation
with
glenmurray
and
mortified
by
adeline
words
and
manner
turned
to
the
window
to
conceal
his
emotion
adeline
then
with
more
than
usual
tenderness
conjured
glenmurray
not
to
talk
too
much
nor
do
anything
to
destroy
the
hopes
on
which
her
only
chance
of
happiness
depended
viz
the
now
possible
chance
of
his
recovery
and
then
set
out
for
her
walk
while
with
a
restraint
and
coldness
which
she
could
not
conquer
she
bade
berrendale
farewell
for
the
present
the
walk
was
long
and
her
thoughts
perturbed
could
glenmurray
want
to
say
to
mr
berrendale
did
mr
berrendale
sit
with
his
eyes
so
intently
and
clandestinely
as
it
were
fixed
on
me
were
thoughts
perpetually
recurring
to
her
and
half
impatient
and
half
reluctant
she
at
length
returned
to
her
lodgings
when
she
entered
the
apartment
she
saw
signs
of
great
emotion
in
the
countenance
of
both
the
gentlemen
and
in
berrendale
eyes
the
traces
of
recent
tears
the
tone
of
glenmurray
voice
too
when
he
addressed
her
was
even
more
tender
than
usual
and
berrendale
attentions
more
marked
yet
more
respectful
and
adeline
observed
that
glenmurray
was
unusually
thoughtful
and
absent
and
that
the
cough
and
other
symptoms
of
his
complaint
were
more
troublesome
than
ever
see
you
have
exerted
yourself
and
talked
too
much
during
my
absence
cried
adeline
i
will
never
leave
you
again
for
so
long
a
time
never
shall
said
glenmurray
must
leave
for
so
long
a
time
at
last
that
i
will
be
blessed
with
the
sight
of
you
as
long
as
i
can
adeline
whose
hopes
had
been
considerably
revived
during
the
last
few
days
looked
mournfully
and
reproachfully
in
his
face
as
he
uttered
these
words
is
even
so
my
dearest
girl
continued
glenmurray
i
say
this
to
guard
you
against
a
melancholy
surprise
i
wish
to
prepare
you
for
an
event
which
to
me
seems
unavoidable
me
exclaimed
adeline
wildly
there
be
any
preparation
to
enable
one
to
bear
such
a
calamity
absurd
idea
however
i
shall
derive
consolation
from
the
severity
of
the
stroke
i
feel
that
i
shall
not
be
able
to
survive
it
so
saying
her
head
fell
on
glenmurray
pillow
and
for
some
time
her
sorrow
almost
suspended
the
consciousness
of
suffering
from
this
state
she
was
aroused
by
glenmurray
being
attacked
with
a
violent
paroxysm
of
his
complaint
and
all
selfish
distress
was
lost
in
the
consciousness
of
his
sufferings
again
he
struggled
through
and
seemed
so
relieved
by
the
effort
that
again
adeline
hopes
revived
and
she
could
scarcely
return
with
temper
berrendale
night
when
glenmurray
expressed
a
wish
to
rest
because
his
spirits
had
not
risen
in
any
proportion
to
hers
the
nurse
had
been
dismissed
that
afternoon
and
adeline
as
savanna
was
not
to
come
home
till
the
next
morning
was
to
sit
up
alone
with
glenmurray
that
night
and
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
he
did
not
insist
that
she
should
have
a
companion
for
a
few
hours
his
exhausted
frame
was
recruited
by
a
sleep
more
than
usually
quiet
and
but
for
a
few
hours
only
he
then
became
restless
and
so
wakeful
and
disturbed
that
he
professed
to
adeline
an
utter
inability
to
sleep
and
therefore
he
wished
to
pass
the
rest
of
the
night
in
serious
conversation
with
her
adeline
alarmed
at
this
intention
conjured
him
not
to
irritate
his
complaint
by
so
dangerous
an
exertion
mind
will
irritate
it
more
replied
he
i
refrain
from
it
for
it
is
burthened
my
adeline
and
it
longs
to
throw
off
its
burthen
now
then
ere
my
senses
wander
hear
what
i
wish
to
communicate
to
you
and
interrupt
me
as
little
as
possible
adeline
oppressed
and
awed
beyond
measure
at
the
unusual
solemnity
of
his
manner
made
no
answer
but
leaning
her
cheek
on
his
hand
awaited
his
communication
in
silence
think
said
glenmurray
shall
begin
with
telling
you
history
it
is
proper
that
you
should
know
all
that
concerns
him
adeline
raising
her
head
replied
hastily
to
satisfy
any
curiosity
of
mine
for
i
feel
none
i
assure
you
then
returned
glenmurray
sighing
please
me
be
berrendale
is
the
son
of
my
mother
sister
by
a
merchant
of
the
neighbourhood
of
the
who
hurt
the
family
pride
so
much
by
marrying
a
tradesman
that
i
am
the
only
one
of
the
clan
who
has
noticed
her
since
he
ran
away
about
four
years
ago
with
the
only
child
of
a
rich
west
indian
from
a
the
consequence
was
that
her
father
renounced
her
but
when
three
years
ago
she
died
in
giving
birth
to
a
son
the
unhappy
parent
repented
of
his
displeasure
and
offered
to
allow
berrendale
who
from
the
bankruptcy
and
sudden
death
of
both
his
parents
had
been
left
destitute
an
annuity
of
for
life
provided
he
would
send
the
child
over
to
jamaica
and
allow
him
to
have
all
the
care
of
his
education
to
this
berrendale
consented
i
hope
said
adeline
merely
out
of
pity
for
the
feelings
of
the
childless
father
hope
so
too
continued
glenmurray
i
do
not
think
the
chance
of
inheriting
all
his
grandfather
property
a
sufficient
reason
to
lead
him
to
give
up
to
another
and
in
a
foreign
land
too
the
society
and
education
of
his
child
but
whatever
were
his
reasons
berrendale
acceded
to
the
request
and
the
infant
was
sent
to
jamaica
and
ever
since
the
has
been
regularly
remitted
to
him
besides
that
he
has
recovered
two
thousand
and
odd
hundred
pounds
from
the
wreck
of
his
father
property
and
with
economy
and
had
he
a
good
wife
to
manage
his
affairs
for
him
berrendale
might
live
very
comfortably
dear
glenmurray
cried
adeline
impatiently
is
this
to
me
and
why
do
you
weary
yourself
to
tell
me
particulars
so
little
interesting
to
me
glenmurray
bade
her
have
patience
and
continued
thus
now
adeline
here
his
voice
evidently
faltered
must
open
my
whole
heart
to
you
and
confess
that
the
idea
of
leaving
you
friendless
unprotected
and
poor
your
reputation
injured
and
your
peace
of
mind
destroyed
is
more
than
i
am
able
to
bear
and
will
give
me
in
my
last
moments
the
torments
of
the
damned
here
a
violent
burst
of
tears
interrupted
him
and
adeline
overcome
with
emotion
and
surprise
at
the
sight
of
the
agitation
which
his
own
sufferings
could
never
occasion
in
him
hung
over
him
in
speechless
woe
continued
glenmurray
recovering
himself
a
little
o
adeline
seizing
her
cold
hand
you
forgive
me
for
having
been
the
means
of
blasting
all
your
fair
fame
and
prospects
in
life
the
sake
of
justice
if
not
of
mercy
exclaimed
adeline
thus
cruelly
to
accuse
yourself
you
know
that
from
my
own
free
unbiassed
choice
i
gave
myself
to
you
and
in
compliance
with
my
own
principles
who
taught
you
those
principles
who
led
you
to
a
train
of
reasoning
so
alluring
in
theory
so
pernicious
in
practice
had
not
i
with
the
heedless
vanity
of
youth
given
to
the
world
the
crude
conceptions
of
you
might
at
this
moment
have
been
the
idol
of
a
respectable
society
and
i
equally
respected
have
been
the
husband
of
your
heart
while
happiness
would
perhaps
have
kept
the
fatal
disease
at
bay
of
which
anxiety
has
facilitated
the
approach
he
was
going
on
but
adeline
who
had
till
now
struggled
successfully
with
her
feelings
wound
up
almost
to
phrensy
at
the
possibility
that
anxiety
had
shortened
glenmurray
life
gave
way
to
a
violent
paroxysm
of
sorrow
which
for
a
while
deprived
her
of
consciousness
and
when
she
recovered
she
found
berrendale
bending
over
her
while
her
head
lay
on
glenmurray
pillow
the
sight
of
berrendale
in
a
moment
roused
her
to
exertion
his
look
was
so
full
of
anxious
tenderness
and
she
was
at
that
moment
so
ill
disposed
to
regard
it
with
complacency
that
she
eagerly
declared
she
was
quite
recovered
and
begged
mr
berrendale
would
return
to
bed
and
glenmurray
seconding
her
request
with
a
deep
sigh
he
departed
fellow
said
glenmurray
wish
you
had
seen
his
anxiety
during
your
illness
am
glad
i
did
replied
adeline
how
can
you
persist
in
talking
to
me
of
any
other
person
anxiety
when
i
am
tortured
with
yours
your
conversation
of
has
made
me
even
more
miserable
than
i
was
before
by
what
strange
fatality
do
you
blame
yourself
for
the
conduct
worthy
of
admiration
for
giving
to
the
world
as
soon
as
produced
opinions
which
were
calculated
to
enlighten
it
replied
glenmurray
those
opinions
militated
against
the
experience
and
custom
of
ages
ought
i
not
to
have
paused
before
i
published
and
kept
them
back
till
they
had
received
the
sanction
of
my
maturer
judgment
does
your
maturer
judgment
condemn
them
years
can
not
have
added
much
to
the
maturity
of
my
judgment
replied
glenmurray
i
will
own
that
some
of
my
opinions
are
changed
and
that
though
i
believe
those
which
are
unchanged
are
right
in
theory
i
think
as
the
mass
of
society
could
never
adopt
them
they
had
better
remain
unacted
upon
than
that
a
few
lonely
individuals
should
expose
themselves
to
certain
distress
by
making
them
the
rules
of
their
conduct
you
for
instance
you
my
adeline
what
misery
here
his
voice
again
faltered
and
emotion
impeded
his
utterance
do
but
live
exclaimed
adeline
passionately
i
can
know
of
misery
but
the
name
i
can
not
live
i
can
not
live
replied
glenmurray
the
sooner
i
die
the
better
for
thus
to
waste
your
youth
and
health
in
the
dreadful
solitude
of
a
is
insupportable
to
me
glenmurray
replied
adeline
fondly
throwing
herself
on
his
neck
you
but
live
free
from
any
violent
pain
and
were
neither
you
nor
i
ever
to
leave
this
room
again
believe
me
i
should
not
have
a
wish
beyond
it
to
see
you
to
hear
you
to
prove
to
you
how
much
i
love
you
would
indeed
it
would
be
happiness
sufficient
for
me
after
this
burst
of
true
and
heartfelt
tenderness
there
was
a
pause
of
some
moments
glenmurray
felt
too
much
to
speak
and
adeline
was
sobbing
on
his
pillow
at
length
she
pathetically
again
exclaimed
only
live
and
i
am
blest
i
live
i
live
again
replied
glenmurray
when
i
die
what
will
become
of
you
care
not
cried
adeline
i
lose
you
may
the
same
grave
receive
us
it
not
my
dearest
grief
does
not
kill
and
entailed
as
my
estate
is
i
have
nothing
to
leave
you
and
though
richly
qualified
to
undertake
the
care
of
children
in
order
to
maintain
yourself
your
unfortunate
connexion
and
singular
opinions
will
be
an
eternal
bar
to
your
being
so
employed
o
adeline
these
cutting
fears
these
dreadful
reflections
are
indeed
the
bitterness
of
death
but
there
is
one
way
of
alleviating
my
pangs
it
replied
adeline
with
quickness
you
must
promise
then
to
hear
me
with
had
i
been
able
to
live
through
my
illness
i
should
have
conjured
you
to
let
me
endeavour
to
restore
you
to
your
place
in
society
and
consequently
to
your
usefulness
by
making
you
my
wife
and
young
and
i
may
add
innocent
and
virtuous
as
you
are
i
doubt
not
but
the
world
would
at
length
have
received
you
into
its
favour
again
you
must
you
will
you
shall
live
interrupted
adeline
i
shall
be
your
happy
wife
replied
glenmurray
laying
an
emphasis
on
the
last
word
adeline
started
and
fixing
her
eyes
wildly
on
his
demanded
what
he
meant
mean
replied
he
prevail
on
you
to
make
my
last
moments
happy
by
promising
some
time
hence
to
give
yourself
a
tender
a
respectable
and
a
legal
protector
glenmurray
exclaimed
adeline
can
you
insult
my
tenderness
for
you
with
such
a
proposal
if
i
can
even
survive
you
do
you
think
that
i
can
bear
to
give
you
a
successor
in
my
affection
or
how
can
you
bear
to
imagine
that
i
shall
my
love
for
you
is
without
selfishness
and
i
wish
you
to
be
happy
even
though
another
makes
you
so
the
lover
or
the
husband
who
wishes
the
woman
of
his
affection
to
form
no
second
attachment
is
in
my
opinion
a
selfish
contemptible
being
perhaps
i
do
not
expect
that
you
will
ever
feel
for
another
man
an
attachment
like
that
which
has
subsisted
between
us
the
first
affection
of
young
and
impassioned
hearts
but
i
am
sure
that
you
may
again
feel
love
enough
to
make
yourself
and
the
man
of
your
choice
perfectly
happy
and
i
hope
and
trust
that
you
will
be
so
forget
you
i
suppose
interrupted
adeline
reproachfully
so
i
would
have
you
remember
me
always
but
with
a
chastized
and
even
a
pleasing
sorrow
nay
i
would
wish
you
to
imagine
me
a
sort
of
guardian
spirit
watching
your
actions
and
enjoying
your
happiness
have
to
you
cried
adeline
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
anguish
i
trust
with
tolerable
patience
there
is
one
thing
yet
for
me
to
learn
the
name
of
the
object
whom
you
wish
me
to
marry
for
i
suppose
is
found
is
returned
glenmurray
loves
you
and
he
it
is
whom
i
wish
you
to
choose
thought
so
exclaimed
adeline
rising
and
traversing
the
room
hastily
and
wringing
her
hands
wherefore
does
his
name
said
glenmurray
such
angry
emotion
perhaps
makes
me
recommend
him
continued
he
forcing
a
smile
he
is
reckoned
like
me
and
i
thought
that
likeness
might
make
him
more
agreeable
to
you
the
more
odious
impatiently
interrupted
adeline
look
like
you
and
not
you
oh
insupportable
idea
she
exclaimed
throwing
herself
on
glenmurray
pillow
and
pressing
his
burning
temples
to
her
cold
cheek
said
glenmurray
solemnly
is
perhaps
the
last
moment
of
confidential
and
uninterrupted
intercourse
that
we
shall
ever
have
together
adeline
started
but
spoke
not
me
therefore
to
tell
you
it
is
my
that
you
would
endeavour
to
dispose
your
mind
in
favour
of
berrendale
and
to
become
in
time
his
wife
circumstanced
as
you
are
your
only
chance
for
happiness
is
becoming
a
wife
but
it
is
too
certain
that
few
men
worthy
of
you
in
the
most
essential
points
will
be
likely
to
marry
you
after
your
connexion
with
me
prejudice
cried
adeline
consider
as
my
disgrace
what
i
deem
my
glory
glenmurray
continued
thus
himself
has
a
great
deal
of
the
old
school
about
him
but
i
have
convinced
him
that
you
are
not
to
be
classed
with
the
frail
of
your
sex
and
that
you
are
one
of
the
purest
as
well
as
loveliest
of
human
beings
did
he
want
to
be
convinced
of
this
cried
adeline
indignantly
you
advise
me
to
marry
him
dearest
love
replied
glenmurray
all
cases
the
most
we
can
expect
is
to
choose
the
best
means
of
happiness
berrendale
is
not
perfect
but
i
am
convinced
that
you
would
commit
a
fatal
error
in
not
making
him
your
husband
and
when
i
tell
you
it
is
my
that
you
should
do
so
you
wish
me
to
retain
my
senses
exclaimed
adeline
that
dreadful
phrase
no
more
will
not
say
any
more
at
all
now
faintly
observed
glenmurray
i
am
exhausted
still
as
morning
begins
to
dawn
i
should
like
to
sit
up
in
my
bed
and
gaze
on
it
perhaps
for
here
adeline
put
her
hand
to
his
mouth
glenmurray
kissed
it
sighed
and
did
not
finish
the
sentence
she
then
opened
the
shutters
to
let
in
the
rising
splendour
of
day
and
turning
round
towards
glenmurray
almost
shrieked
with
terror
at
seeing
the
visible
alteration
a
night
had
made
in
his
appearance
while
the
yellow
rays
of
the
dawn
played
on
his
sallow
cheek
and
his
dark
curls
once
crisped
and
glossy
hung
faint
and
moist
on
his
beating
temples
is
strange
adeline
said
glenmurray
but
with
great
effort
even
in
my
situation
the
sight
of
morning
and
the
revival
as
it
were
of
nature
seems
to
invigorate
my
whole
frame
i
long
to
breathe
the
freshness
of
its
breeze
also
adeline
conscious
for
the
first
time
that
all
hope
was
over
opened
the
window
and
felt
even
her
sick
soul
and
languid
frame
revived
by
the
chill
but
refreshing
breeze
to
glenmurray
it
imparted
a
feeling
of
physical
pleasure
to
which
he
had
long
been
a
stranger
breathe
freely
he
exclaimed
feel
alive
again
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
adeline
hopes
began
to
revive
feel
as
if
i
could
sleep
now
said
glenmurray
feverish
restlessness
seems
abated
but
lest
my
dreams
be
disturbed
promise
me
ere
i
lie
down
again
that
you
will
behave
kindly
to
berrendale
the
only
tie
that
bound
me
to
him
is
broken
i
thought
he
sincerely
sympathized
with
me
in
my
wishes
for
your
recovery
but
now
that
as
he
loves
me
his
wishes
must
be
in
direct
opposition
to
mine
i
can
not
indeed
i
can
not
endure
the
sight
of
him
glenmurray
could
not
reply
to
this
natural
observation
he
knew
that
in
a
similar
situation
his
feelings
would
have
been
like
adeline
and
pressing
her
hand
with
all
the
little
strength
left
him
he
said
berrendale
and
tried
to
compose
himself
to
sleep
while
adeline
lost
in
sad
contemplation
threw
herself
in
a
chair
by
his
and
anxiously
awaited
the
event
of
his
but
it
was
not
long
before
adeline
herself
exhausted
both
in
body
and
mind
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
and
it
was
before
she
awoke
for
no
careless
and
hired
nurse
now
watched
the
slumbers
of
the
unhappy
lovers
but
the
mulatto
stepping
light
as
air
and
afraid
even
of
breathing
lest
she
should
disturb
their
repose
had
assumed
her
station
at
the
and
taken
every
precaution
lest
any
noise
should
awake
them
hers
was
the
service
of
the
heart
and
there
is
none
like
it
at
twelve
adeline
awoke
and
her
first
glance
met
the
dark
eyes
of
savanna
kindly
fixed
upon
her
adeline
started
not
immediately
recollecting
who
it
could
be
but
in
a
moment
the
idea
of
the
mulatto
and
of
the
service
which
she
had
rendered
her
recurred
to
her
mind
and
diffused
a
sensation
of
pleasure
through
her
frame
is
a
being
whom
i
have
served
said
adeline
to
herself
and
extending
her
hand
to
savanna
she
started
from
her
seat
invigorated
by
the
thought
but
she
felt
depressed
again
by
the
consciousness
that
she
who
had
been
able
to
impart
so
much
joy
and
help
to
another
was
herself
a
wretch
for
ever
and
in
a
moment
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
while
the
mulatto
gazed
on
her
with
a
look
of
inquiring
solicitude
savanna
cried
adeline
in
a
low
and
plaintive
tone
there
are
moments
when
the
sound
of
one
own
voice
has
a
mournful
effect
on
one
feelings
this
was
one
of
those
moments
to
adeline
the
pathos
of
her
own
tone
overcame
her
and
she
burst
into
tears
but
glenmurray
slept
on
and
adeline
hoped
nothing
would
suddenly
disturb
his
rest
when
berrendale
opened
the
door
with
what
appeared
unnecessary
noise
and
glenmurray
hastily
awoke
adeline
immediately
started
from
her
seat
and
looking
at
him
with
great
indignation
demanded
why
he
came
in
in
such
a
manner
when
he
knew
mr
glenmurray
was
asleep
berrendale
shocked
and
alarmed
at
adeline
words
and
expression
so
unlike
her
usual
manner
stammered
out
an
excuse
time
sir
replied
adeline
coldly
hope
you
will
be
more
is
the
matter
said
glenmurray
raising
himself
in
the
bed
you
scolding
adeline
if
so
let
me
hear
you
i
like
novelty
here
adeline
and
berrendale
both
hastened
to
him
and
adeline
almost
looked
with
complacency
on
berrendale
when
glenmurray
declaring
himself
wonderfully
refreshed
by
his
long
sleep
expressed
a
great
desire
for
his
breakfast
and
said
he
had
a
most
voracious
appetite
but
to
all
berrendale
attentions
she
returned
the
most
forbidding
reserve
nor
could
she
for
a
moment
lose
the
painful
idea
that
the
death
of
glenmurray
would
be
to
him
a
source
of
joy
not
of
anguish
berrendale
was
not
slow
to
observe
this
change
in
her
conduct
and
he
conceived
that
as
he
knew
glenmurray
had
mentioned
his
pretensions
to
her
his
absence
would
be
of
more
service
to
his
wishes
than
his
presence
and
he
resolved
to
leave
richmond
that
afternoon
especially
as
he
had
a
dinner
engagement
at
a
tavern
in
london
which
in
spite
of
love
and
friendship
he
was
desirous
of
keeping
he
was
not
mistaken
in
his
ideas
the
countenance
of
adeline
assumed
less
severity
when
he
mentioned
his
intention
of
going
away
nor
could
she
express
regret
at
his
resolution
even
though
glenmurray
with
anxious
earnestness
requested
him
to
stay
but
glenmurray
entreated
in
vain
used
to
consider
his
own
interest
and
pleasure
in
preference
to
that
of
others
berrendale
resolved
to
go
and
resisted
the
prayers
of
a
man
who
had
often
obliged
him
with
the
greatest
difficulty
to
himself
then
said
glenmurray
mournfully
you
must
go
god
bless
you
i
wish
you
charles
all
possible
earthly
happiness
nay
i
have
done
all
i
can
to
ensure
it
you
but
you
have
disappointed
me
i
hoped
to
have
joined
your
hand
in
my
last
moments
to
that
of
this
dear
girl
and
to
have
bequeathed
her
in
the
most
solemn
manner
to
your
care
and
tenderness
but
no
matter
farewell
we
shall
probably
meet
no
more
here
berrendale
heart
failed
him
and
he
almost
resolved
to
stay
but
a
look
of
angry
repugnance
which
he
saw
on
adeline
countenance
even
amidst
her
sorrow
got
the
better
of
his
kind
emotions
by
wounding
his
and
grasping
glenmurray
hand
and
saying
shall
be
back
in
a
day
or
two
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
am
sorry
mr
berrendale
is
forced
to
go
said
adeline
involuntarily
when
the
street
door
closed
after
him
you
condescended
to
tell
him
so
he
would
undoubtedly
have
staid
replied
glenmurray
rather
peevishly
adeline
instantly
felt
and
regretted
the
selfishness
of
her
conduct
to
avoid
the
sight
of
a
disagreeable
object
she
had
given
pain
to
glenmurray
or
rather
she
had
not
done
her
utmost
to
prevent
his
being
exposed
to
it
me
said
adeline
bursting
into
tears
own
i
thought
only
of
myself
when
i
forbore
to
urge
his
stay
alas
with
you
and
you
alone
i
believe
is
the
gratification
of
self
always
a
secondary
consideration
forget
that
i
am
a
philanthropist
replied
glenmurray
can
not
bear
to
be
praised
even
by
you
at
the
expense
of
my
but
come
hasten
dinner
my
breakfast
agreed
with
me
so
well
that
i
am
impatient
for
another
meal
certainly
are
better
exclaimed
adeline
with
unwonted
cheerfulness
feelings
are
more
tolerable
at
least
replied
glenmurray
and
adeline
and
the
mulatto
began
to
prepare
the
dinner
immediately
how
often
during
her
attendance
on
glenmurray
had
she
recollected
the
words
of
her
grandmother
and
blessed
her
for
having
taught
her
to
be
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
glenmurray
complained
of
being
drowsy
still
he
declared
he
would
not
go
to
bed
till
he
had
seen
the
sun
set
as
he
had
that
day
for
the
second
time
since
his
illness
seen
it
rise
and
therefore
when
it
was
setting
adeline
and
savanna
led
him
into
a
room
adjoining
which
had
a
western
aspect
glenmurray
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
crimson
horizon
with
a
peculiar
expression
and
his
lips
seemed
to
murmur
the
last
time
let
me
breathe
the
evening
air
too
once
more
said
he
is
too
chill
dear
glenmurray
will
not
hurt
me
replied
glenmurray
and
adeline
complied
with
his
request
breeze
of
evening
is
not
refreshing
like
that
of
morning
he
observed
the
beauty
of
the
setting
is
perhaps
superior
to
that
of
the
rising
sun
they
are
both
glorious
sights
and
i
have
enjoyed
them
both
nor
have
i
for
years
experienced
so
strong
a
feeling
of
devotion
god
cried
adeline
glenmurray
there
has
been
one
thing
only
wanting
to
the
completion
of
our
union
and
that
was
that
we
should
worship
together
had
i
remained
longer
here
replied
glenmurray
might
have
done
so
for
believe
me
adeline
though
my
feelings
have
continually
hurried
me
into
adoration
of
the
supreme
being
i
have
often
wished
my
homage
to
be
as
regular
and
as
founded
on
immutable
conviction
as
it
once
was
but
it
is
too
late
now
for
amendment
though
alas
not
for
regret
yet
he
who
reads
the
heart
knows
that
my
intentions
were
pure
and
that
i
was
not
fixed
in
the
stubbornness
of
error
us
change
this
discourse
cried
adeline
seeing
on
countenance
an
expression
of
uncommon
sadness
which
he
from
a
regard
to
her
feelings
struggled
to
cover
he
did
indeed
feel
sadness
a
sadness
of
the
most
painful
nature
and
while
adeline
hung
over
him
with
all
the
anxious
and
soothing
attention
of
unbounded
love
he
seemed
to
shrink
from
her
embrace
with
horror
and
turning
away
his
head
feebly
murmured
adeline
this
faithful
kindness
wounds
me
to
the
very
soul
alas
alas
how
little
have
i
deserved
it
if
glenmurray
who
had
been
the
means
of
injuring
the
woman
he
loved
merely
by
following
the
dictates
of
his
conscience
and
a
love
of
what
he
imagined
to
be
truth
without
any
view
of
his
own
benefit
or
the
gratification
of
his
personal
wishes
felt
thus
acutely
the
anguish
of
what
ought
to
be
and
what
must
be
sooner
or
later
the
agony
and
remorse
of
that
man
who
merely
for
the
gratification
of
his
own
illicit
desires
has
seduced
the
woman
whom
he
loved
from
the
path
of
virtue
and
ruined
for
ever
her
reputation
and
her
peace
of
mind
is
too
late
now
for
you
to
sit
at
an
open
window
indeed
it
is
cried
adeline
after
having
replied
to
glenmurray
by
the
touching
language
of
tears
and
incoherent
expressions
of
confiding
and
unchanged
attachment
as
you
are
evidently
better
do
not
by
breathing
too
much
cold
air
run
the
risk
of
making
yourself
worse
again
i
were
really
better
would
i
could
live
passionately
exclaimed
glenmurray
indeed
i
do
feel
stronger
than
i
have
felt
for
many
months
in
a
moment
the
fine
eyes
of
adeline
were
raised
to
heaven
with
an
expression
of
devout
thankfulness
and
eager
to
make
the
most
of
a
change
so
favourable
she
hurried
glenmurray
back
to
his
chamber
and
with
a
feeling
of
renewed
hope
sat
by
to
watch
his
slumbers
she
had
not
sat
long
before
the
door
opened
and
the
little
tawny
boy
entered
he
had
watched
all
day
to
see
the
good
lady
as
he
called
adeline
but
as
she
had
not
left
glenmurray
chamber
except
to
prepare
dinner
he
had
been
disappointed
so
he
was
resolved
to
seek
her
in
her
own
apartment
he
had
bought
some
cakes
with
the
penny
which
adeline
had
given
him
and
he
was
eager
to
give
her
a
piece
of
them
cried
adeline
as
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
and
he
in
a
whisper
crying
held
his
purchase
to
her
lips
adeline
tasted
it
said
it
was
very
good
and
giving
him
a
halfpenny
the
tawny
boy
disappeared
again
the
noise
he
made
as
he
bounded
down
the
stairs
woke
glenmurray
adeline
was
sitting
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
as
he
turned
round
to
sleep
again
he
grasped
her
hand
in
his
and
its
feverish
touch
damped
her
hopes
and
her
fears
for
a
short
time
she
mournfully
gazed
on
his
flushed
cheek
and
then
gently
sliding
off
the
bed
and
dropping
on
one
knee
she
addressed
the
deity
in
the
language
of
humble
supplication
insensibly
she
ceased
to
pray
in
thought
only
and
the
prayer
became
audible
again
glenmurray
awoke
and
adeline
reproached
herself
as
the
cause
rest
was
uneasy
cried
he
i
rejoice
that
you
woke
me
besides
i
like
to
hear
you
go
on
my
dearest
girl
there
is
a
something
in
the
breathings
of
your
pious
fondness
that
soothes
me
added
he
pressing
the
hand
he
held
to
his
parched
lips
adeline
obeyed
and
as
she
continued
she
felt
ever
and
anon
by
the
pressure
of
glenmurray
hand
how
much
he
was
affected
by
what
she
uttered
must
he
be
taken
from
me
she
exclaimed
in
one
part
of
her
prayer
if
it
be
possible
permit
this
cup
to
pass
by
me
untasted
here
she
felt
the
hand
of
glenmurray
grasp
hers
most
vehemently
and
delighted
to
think
that
he
had
pleasure
in
hearing
her
she
went
on
to
breathe
forth
all
the
wishes
of
a
trembling
yet
confiding
spirit
till
overcome
with
her
own
emotions
she
ceased
and
arose
and
leaning
over
glenmurray
pillow
was
going
to
take
his
hand
but
the
hand
which
she
pressed
returned
not
her
pressure
the
eyes
were
fixed
whose
approving
glance
she
sought
and
the
horrid
truth
rushed
at
once
on
her
mind
that
the
last
convulsive
grasp
had
been
an
eternal
farewell
and
that
he
had
in
that
grasp
expired
alas
what
preparation
however
long
what
anticipation
however
sure
can
enable
the
mind
to
bear
a
shock
like
this
it
came
on
adeline
like
a
she
screamed
not
she
moved
not
but
fixing
a
dim
and
glassy
eye
on
the
pale
countenance
of
her
lover
she
seemed
as
insensible
as
poor
glenmurray
himself
and
hours
might
have
elapsed
hours
immediately
fatal
both
to
her
senses
and
existence
ere
any
one
had
entered
the
room
since
she
had
given
orders
to
be
disturbed
by
no
one
had
not
the
tawny
boy
encouraged
by
his
past
success
stolen
in
again
unperceived
to
give
her
a
piece
of
the
apple
which
he
had
bought
with
her
last
bounty
the
delighted
boy
tripped
gaily
to
the
holding
up
his
treasure
but
he
started
back
and
screamed
in
all
the
agony
of
terror
at
the
sight
which
he
beheld
the
face
of
glenmurray
ghastly
and
the
mouth
distorted
as
if
in
the
last
agony
and
adeline
in
the
stupor
of
despair
the
affectionate
boy
repeated
screams
soon
summoned
the
whole
family
into
the
room
while
he
vainly
hanging
on
adeline
arm
begged
her
to
speak
to
him
but
nothing
could
at
first
rouse
adeline
not
even
savanna
loud
and
extravagant
grief
when
however
they
tried
to
force
her
from
the
body
she
recovered
her
recollection
and
her
strength
and
it
was
with
great
difficulty
she
could
be
carried
out
of
the
room
and
kept
out
when
they
had
accomplished
their
purpose
but
savanna
was
sure
that
looking
at
such
a
sad
sight
would
kill
her
mistress
for
she
should
die
herself
if
she
saw
william
dead
she
declared
and
the
people
of
the
house
agreed
with
her
they
knew
not
that
grief
is
the
best
medicine
for
itself
and
that
the
overcharged
heart
is
often
relieved
by
the
sight
which
conceive
likely
to
snap
the
very
threads
of
existence
as
adeline
and
glenmurray
had
both
of
them
excited
some
interest
in
richmond
the
news
of
the
death
of
the
latter
was
immediately
abroad
and
it
was
told
to
mrs
pemberton
with
a
pathetic
account
of
distress
just
as
the
carriage
was
preparing
to
convey
her
and
her
sick
friend
on
their
way
to
lisbon
it
was
a
relation
to
call
forth
all
the
humanity
of
mrs
pemberton
nature
she
forgot
adeline
crime
in
her
distress
and
knowing
she
had
no
female
friend
with
her
she
hastened
on
the
errand
of
pity
to
the
abode
of
vice
alas
mrs
pemberton
had
learnt
but
too
well
to
sympathize
in
grief
like
that
of
adeline
she
had
seen
a
beloved
husband
expire
in
her
arms
and
had
afterwards
followed
two
children
to
the
grave
but
she
had
taken
refuge
from
sorrow
in
the
active
duties
of
her
religion
and
was
enabled
to
become
a
teacher
of
those
truths
to
others
by
which
she
had
so
much
benefited
herself
mrs
pemberton
entered
the
room
just
as
adeline
on
her
knees
was
conjuring
the
persons
with
her
to
allow
her
to
see
glenmurray
once
more
adeline
did
not
at
all
observe
the
entrance
of
mrs
pemberton
who
in
spite
of
the
which
her
principles
and
habits
gave
her
was
visibly
affected
when
she
beheld
the
mourner
tearless
affliction
and
the
hands
which
on
her
entrance
were
quietly
crossed
on
each
other
confining
the
modest
folds
of
her
simple
cloak
were
suddenly
and
involuntarily
separated
by
the
irresistible
impulse
of
pity
while
catching
hold
of
the
wall
for
support
she
leaned
against
it
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
me
see
him
only
let
me
see
him
once
more
cried
adeline
gazing
on
mrs
pemberton
but
unconscious
who
she
was
shalt
see
him
replied
mrs
pemberton
with
considerable
effort
me
thy
hand
and
i
will
go
with
thee
to
the
chamber
of
death
adeline
gave
a
scream
of
mournful
joy
at
this
permission
and
suffered
herself
to
be
led
into
glenmurray
apartment
as
soon
as
she
entered
it
she
sprang
to
the
bed
and
throwing
herself
beside
the
corpse
began
to
contemplate
it
with
an
earnestness
and
firmness
which
surprised
every
one
mrs
pemberton
also
fixedly
gazed
on
the
wan
face
of
glenmurray
art
thou
fallen
she
exclaimed
wise
in
thine
own
conceit
who
presumedst
perhaps
sometimes
to
question
even
the
existence
of
the
most
high
and
to
set
up
thy
vain
chimeras
of
yesterday
against
the
wisdom
and
experience
of
centuries
child
of
the
dust
child
of
error
what
art
thou
now
and
whither
is
thy
guilty
spirit
fled
but
balmy
is
the
hand
of
affliction
and
she
thy
mourning
victim
may
learn
to
bless
the
hand
that
chastizes
her
nor
add
to
the
offences
which
will
weigh
down
thy
soul
a
dread
responsibility
for
hers
here
she
was
interrupted
by
the
voice
of
adeline
who
in
a
deep
and
hollow
tone
was
addressing
the
unconscious
corpse
god
sake
speak
for
this
silence
is
dreadful
it
looks
so
like
death
thing
said
mrs
pemberton
kneeling
beside
her
is
it
even
thus
with
thee
would
thou
couldst
shed
tears
afflicted
one
is
very
strange
continued
adeline
loved
me
so
tenderly
and
he
used
to
speak
and
look
so
tenderly
and
now
see
how
he
neglects
me
glenmurray
my
love
for
mercy
sake
speak
to
me
as
she
said
this
she
laid
her
lips
to
his
but
feeling
on
them
the
icy
coldness
of
death
she
started
back
screaming
in
all
the
violence
of
phrensy
and
recovered
to
the
full
consciousness
of
her
misfortune
she
was
carried
back
to
her
room
in
violent
convulsions
i
could
stay
and
watch
over
thee
said
mrs
pemberton
as
she
gazed
on
adeline
distorted
countenance
thou
young
as
thou
art
wert
well
known
in
the
chambers
of
sorrow
and
of
sickness
and
i
should
rejoice
to
pay
back
to
thee
part
of
the
debt
of
those
whom
thy
presence
so
often
soothed
but
i
must
leave
thee
to
the
care
of
others
leave
her
to
my
care
cried
savanna
reproachfully
who
felt
even
her
violent
sorrow
suspended
while
mrs
pemberton
spoke
in
accents
at
once
sad
yet
soothing
leave
her
to
my
care
and
who
watch
who
love
her
more
than
me
savanna
replied
mrs
pemberton
pressing
the
mulatto
hand
as
she
returned
to
her
station
beside
adeline
who
was
fallen
into
a
calm
slumber
thy
care
with
confidence
i
commit
her
but
perhaps
there
may
be
an
immediate
necessity
for
money
and
i
had
better
leave
this
with
thee
she
added
taking
out
her
purse
but
savanna
assured
her
that
mr
berrendale
was
sent
for
and
to
him
all
those
concerns
were
to
be
left
mrs
pemberton
stood
for
a
few
moments
looking
at
adeline
in
silence
then
slowly
left
the
house
when
adeline
awoke
she
seemed
so
calm
and
resigned
that
her
earnest
request
of
being
allowed
to
pass
the
night
alone
was
granted
especially
as
mrs
pemberton
had
desired
that
her
wish
even
to
see
glenmurray
again
should
be
complied
with
but
the
faithful
mulatto
watched
till
morning
at
the
door
no
bed
that
night
received
the
weary
limbs
of
adeline
she
threw
herself
on
the
ground
and
in
alternate
prayer
and
phrensy
passed
the
first
night
of
her
woe
towards
morning
however
she
fell
into
a
perturbed
sleep
but
when
the
light
of
day
darting
into
the
room
awakened
her
to
consciousness
and
when
she
recollected
that
he
to
whom
it
usually
summoned
her
existed
no
longer
that
the
eyes
which
but
the
preceding
morning
had
opened
with
enthusiastic
ardour
to
hail
its
beams
were
now
for
ever
closed
and
that
the
voice
which
used
to
welcome
her
so
tenderly
she
should
never
never
hear
again
the
forlornness
of
her
situation
the
hopelessness
of
her
sorrow
burst
upon
her
with
a
violence
too
powerful
for
her
reason
and
when
berrendale
arrived
he
found
glenmurray
in
his
shroud
and
adeline
in
a
state
of
insanity
for
six
months
her
phrensy
resisted
all
the
efforts
of
medicine
and
the
united
care
which
berrendale
love
and
grateful
attachment
could
bestow
while
with
adeline
want
of
their
care
seemed
to
increase
their
desire
of
bestowing
it
and
their
affection
gathered
new
strength
from
the
duration
of
her
helpless
malady
so
true
is
it
that
we
become
attached
more
from
the
aid
which
we
give
than
that
which
we
receive
and
that
the
love
of
the
obliger
is
more
apt
to
increase
than
that
of
the
obliged
by
the
obligation
conferred
at
length
however
adeline
reason
slowly
yet
surely
returned
and
she
by
degrees
learnt
to
contemplate
with
firmness
and
even
calmness
the
loss
which
she
had
sustained
she
even
looked
on
berrendale
and
his
attentions
not
with
anger
but
gratitude
and
complacency
she
had
even
pleasure
in
observing
the
likeness
he
bore
glenmurray
she
felt
that
it
endeared
him
to
her
in
the
first
paroxysms
of
her
phrensy
the
sight
of
him
threw
her
into
fits
of
ravings
but
as
she
grew
better
she
had
pleasure
in
seeing
him
and
when
on
her
recovery
she
heard
how
much
she
was
indebted
to
his
persevering
tenderness
she
felt
for
him
a
decided
regard
which
berrendale
tried
to
flatter
himself
might
be
ripened
into
love
but
he
was
mistaken
the
heart
of
adeline
was
formed
to
feel
violent
and
lasting
attachments
only
she
had
always
loved
her
mother
with
a
tenderness
of
a
most
uncommon
nature
she
had
felt
for
glenmurray
the
fondest
enthusiasm
of
passion
she
was
now
separated
from
them
both
but
her
mother
still
lived
and
though
almost
hopeless
of
ever
being
restored
to
her
society
all
her
love
for
her
returned
and
she
pined
for
that
consoling
fondness
those
soothing
attentions
which
in
a
time
of
such
affliction
a
mother
on
a
widowed
daughter
can
alone
bestow
surely
cried
she
in
the
solitude
of
her
own
room
oath
can
not
now
forbid
her
to
forgive
me
for
am
i
not
as
wretched
in
love
nay
more
far
more
so
than
has
been
yes
yes
i
will
write
to
her
besides
he
wished
me
to
do
so
meaning
glenmurray
whom
she
never
named
and
she
did
write
to
her
according
to
the
address
which
dr
norberry
sent
soon
after
he
returned
to
his
own
house
still
week
after
week
elapsed
and
month
after
month
but
no
answer
came
again
she
wrote
and
again
she
was
disappointed
though
her
loss
her
illness
in
consequence
of
it
her
pecuniary
distress
and
the
large
debt
which
she
had
incurred
to
berrendale
were
all
detailed
in
a
manner
calculated
to
move
the
most
obdurate
heart
what
then
could
adeline
suppose
perhaps
her
mother
was
ill
perhaps
she
was
dead
and
her
reason
was
again
on
the
point
of
yielding
to
this
horrible
supposition
when
she
received
her
two
letters
in
a
cover
directed
in
her
at
first
she
was
overwhelmed
by
this
dreadful
proof
of
the
continuance
of
mrs
mowbray
deep
resentment
but
ever
sanguine
the
circumstance
of
mrs
mowbray
having
written
the
address
herself
appeared
to
adeline
a
favourable
symptom
and
with
renewed
hope
she
wrote
to
dr
norberry
to
become
her
mediator
once
more
but
to
this
letter
no
answer
was
returned
and
adeline
concluded
her
only
friend
had
died
of
the
fever
which
mrs
norberry
had
mentioned
in
her
letter
i
have
lost
my
only
friend
cried
adeline
wringing
her
hands
in
agony
as
this
idea
recurred
to
her
only
friend
repeated
berrendale
who
happened
to
be
present
adeline
her
heart
smote
her
as
he
said
this
oldest
friend
i
should
have
said
she
replied
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
and
berrendale
thought
himself
happy
but
adeline
was
far
from
meaning
to
give
the
encouragement
which
this
action
seemed
to
bestow
wholly
occupied
by
her
affliction
her
mind
had
lost
its
energy
and
she
would
not
have
made
an
effort
to
dissipate
her
grief
by
employment
and
exertion
had
not
that
virtuous
pride
and
delicacy
which
in
happier
hours
had
been
the
ornament
of
her
character
rebelled
against
the
consciousness
of
owing
pecuniary
obligations
to
the
lover
whose
suit
she
was
determined
to
reject
and
urged
her
to
make
some
vigorous
attempt
to
maintain
herself
many
were
the
schemes
which
occurred
to
her
but
none
seemed
so
practicable
as
that
of
keeping
a
in
some
village
near
the
true
glenmurray
had
said
that
her
having
been
his
mistress
would
prevent
her
obtaining
scholars
but
his
fears
perhaps
were
stronger
than
his
justice
in
this
case
these
fears
however
she
found
existed
in
berrendale
mind
also
though
he
ventured
only
to
hint
them
with
great
caution
think
then
no
prudent
parents
if
my
story
should
be
known
to
them
would
send
their
children
to
me
said
adeline
to
berrendale
fear
i
that
is
to
say
i
am
sure
they
would
not
such
circumstances
said
adeline
yourself
would
not
send
a
child
to
my
school
really
i
as
the
world
goes
replied
berrendale
am
answered
said
adeline
with
a
look
and
tone
of
displeasure
and
retired
to
her
chamber
intending
not
to
return
till
berrendale
was
gone
to
his
own
lodging
but
her
heart
soon
reproached
her
with
unjust
resentment
and
coming
back
she
apologized
to
berrendale
for
being
angry
at
his
laudable
resolution
of
acting
according
to
those
principles
which
he
thought
most
virtuous
especially
as
she
claimed
for
herself
a
similar
right
berrendale
gratified
by
her
apology
replied
he
saw
no
objection
to
her
plan
if
she
chose
to
deny
him
the
happiness
of
sharing
his
income
with
her
provided
she
would
settle
in
a
village
where
she
was
not
likely
to
be
known
and
change
her
name
my
name
never
concealment
of
any
kind
almost
always
implies
the
consciousness
of
guilt
and
while
my
heart
does
not
condemn
me
my
conduct
shall
not
seem
to
accuse
me
i
will
go
to
whatever
place
you
shall
recommend
but
i
beg
your
other
request
may
be
mentioned
no
more
berrendale
glad
to
be
forgiven
on
any
terms
promised
to
comply
with
her
wishes
and
he
having
recommended
to
her
to
settle
at
a
village
some
few
miles
north
of
london
adeline
hired
there
a
small
but
commodious
lodging
and
issued
immediately
cards
of
advertisement
stating
what
she
meant
to
teach
and
on
what
terms
while
berrendale
took
lodgings
within
a
mile
of
her
and
the
faithful
mulatto
attended
her
as
a
servant
of
fortunately
at
this
time
a
lady
at
richmond
who
had
a
son
the
age
of
the
tawny
boy
became
so
attached
to
him
that
she
was
desirous
of
bringing
him
up
to
be
the
and
future
attendant
on
her
son
and
the
mulatto
pleased
to
have
him
so
well
disposed
of
resisted
the
poor
little
boy
tears
and
reluctance
at
the
idea
of
being
separated
from
her
and
adeline
and
before
she
left
richmond
she
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
comfortably
settled
in
the
house
of
his
patroness
adeline
succeeded
in
her
undertaking
even
beyond
her
utmost
wishes
though
unknown
and
unrecommended
there
was
in
her
countenance
and
manner
a
something
so
engaging
so
strongly
inviting
confidence
and
so
decisively
bespeaking
the
gentlewoman
that
she
soon
excited
in
the
village
general
respect
and
attention
and
no
sooner
were
scholars
entrusted
to
her
care
than
she
became
the
idol
of
her
pupils
and
their
improvement
was
rapid
in
proportion
to
the
love
which
they
bore
her
this
fortunate
circumstance
proved
a
balm
to
the
wounded
mind
of
adeline
she
felt
that
she
had
recovered
her
usefulness
that
desideratum
in
morals
and
life
spite
of
her
misfortunes
acquired
a
charm
in
her
eyes
true
it
was
that
she
was
restored
to
her
capability
of
being
useful
by
being
where
she
was
unknown
and
because
the
mulatto
unknown
to
her
had
described
her
as
reduced
to
earn
her
living
on
account
of
the
death
of
the
man
to
whom
she
was
about
to
be
married
but
she
did
not
revert
to
the
reasons
of
her
being
so
generally
esteemed
she
contented
herself
with
the
consciousness
of
being
so
and
for
some
months
she
was
tranquil
though
not
happy
but
her
tranquillity
was
destined
to
be
of
short
duration
chapter
xviii
the
village
in
which
adeline
resided
happened
to
be
the
native
place
of
mary
warner
the
servant
whom
she
had
been
forced
to
dismiss
at
richmond
and
who
having
gone
from
mrs
pemberton
to
another
situation
which
she
had
also
quitted
came
to
visit
her
friends
the
wish
of
saying
lessening
things
of
those
of
whom
one
hears
extravagant
commendations
is
i
fear
common
to
almost
every
one
even
where
the
object
praised
comes
in
no
competition
with
oneself
and
when
mary
warner
heard
from
every
quarter
of
the
grace
and
elegance
affability
and
active
benevolence
of
the
new
comer
it
was
no
doubt
infinitely
gratifying
to
her
to
be
able
to
exclaim
did
you
say
her
name
is
la
i
dares
to
say
it
is
my
old
mistress
who
was
kept
by
one
mr
glenmurray
but
so
greatly
were
her
auditors
prepossessed
in
favour
of
adeline
that
very
few
of
them
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
believe
supposition
was
just
and
so
much
was
she
piqued
at
the
disbelief
which
she
met
with
that
she
declared
she
would
go
to
church
the
next
sunday
to
shame
the
hussey
and
go
up
and
speak
to
her
in
the
before
all
the
people
do
so
if
you
ever
saw
our
miss
mowbray
before
was
the
answer
and
mary
eagerly
looked
forward
to
the
approaching
sunday
meanwhile
as
we
are
all
of
us
but
too
apt
to
repeat
stories
to
the
prejudice
of
others
even
though
we
do
not
believe
them
this
strange
assertion
of
mary
was
circulated
through
the
village
even
by
adeline
admirers
and
the
next
sunday
was
expected
by
the
unconscious
adeline
alone
with
no
unusual
eagerness
sunday
came
and
adeline
as
she
was
wont
to
do
attended
the
service
but
from
the
situation
of
her
pew
she
could
neither
see
mary
nor
be
seen
by
her
till
church
was
over
adeline
then
as
usual
was
walking
down
the
broad
walk
of
the
surrounded
by
the
parents
of
the
children
who
came
to
her
school
and
receiving
from
them
the
customary
marks
of
respect
when
mary
bustling
through
the
crowd
accosted
her
with
your
sarvant
miss
mowbray
i
am
glad
to
see
you
here
in
such
a
respectable
situation
adeline
though
in
the
lady
who
accosted
her
she
had
some
difficulty
in
recognizing
her
quondam
servant
recollected
the
pert
shrill
voice
and
insolent
manner
of
mary
immediately
and
involuntarily
starting
when
she
addressed
her
from
painful
associations
and
fear
of
impending
evil
she
replied
are
you
mary
in
a
faltering
tone
it
is
mary
miss
mowbray
whispered
mary
auditors
of
the
day
before
to
each
other
while
mary
proud
of
her
success
looked
triumphantly
at
them
and
was
resolved
to
pursue
the
advantage
which
she
had
gained
you
have
lost
mr
glenmurray
i
find
continued
mary
adeline
spoke
not
but
walked
hastily
on
but
mary
kept
pace
with
her
speaking
as
loud
as
she
could
did
the
little
one
live
pray
still
adeline
spoke
not
sort
of
a
had
you
miss
mowbray
at
this
question
adeline
other
sensations
were
lost
in
strong
indignation
and
resuming
all
the
modest
but
collected
dignity
of
her
manner
she
turned
round
and
fixing
her
eyes
steadily
on
the
insulting
girl
exclaimed
aloud
i
never
injured
you
either
in
thought
word
or
deed
whence
comes
it
then
that
you
endeavour
to
make
the
finger
of
scorn
point
at
me
and
make
me
shrink
with
shame
and
confusion
from
the
eye
of
observation
indeed
replied
mary
but
she
was
not
allowed
to
proceed
for
a
gentleman
hastily
stepped
forward
crying
is
impossible
for
us
to
suffer
such
insults
to
be
offered
to
miss
mowbray
i
desire
therefore
that
you
will
take
your
daughter
away
turning
to
mary
father
and
if
possible
teach
her
better
manners
having
said
this
he
overtook
the
agitated
adeline
and
offering
her
his
arm
saw
her
home
to
her
lodgings
while
those
who
had
heard
with
surprise
and
suspicion
the
strange
and
impertinent
questions
and
insolent
tone
of
mary
resumed
in
a
degree
their
confidence
in
adeline
and
turned
a
disgusted
and
deaf
ear
to
the
hysterical
vehemence
with
which
the
mary
defended
herself
and
vilified
adeline
as
her
father
and
almost
by
force
led
her
out
of
the
the
gentleman
who
had
so
kindly
stepped
forward
to
the
assistance
of
adeline
was
mr
beauclerc
the
surgeon
of
the
village
a
man
of
considerable
abilities
and
liberal
principles
and
when
he
bade
adeline
farewell
he
said
wife
will
do
herself
the
pleasure
of
calling
on
you
this
evening
then
kindly
pressing
her
hand
he
with
a
respectful
bow
took
his
leave
luckily
for
adeline
berrendale
was
detained
in
town
that
day
and
she
was
spared
the
mortification
of
showing
herself
to
him
writhing
as
she
was
under
the
agonies
of
public
shame
for
such
it
seemed
to
her
convinced
as
she
was
of
the
light
in
which
she
must
have
appeared
to
the
persons
around
her
from
the
malicious
interrogatories
of
mary
convinced
too
as
she
was
more
than
beginning
to
be
of
the
fallacy
of
the
reasoning
which
had
led
her
to
deserve
and
even
to
glory
in
the
situation
which
she
now
blushed
to
hear
disclosed
and
conscious
as
she
was
that
to
remain
in
the
village
and
expect
to
retain
her
school
was
now
impossible
she
gave
herself
up
to
a
burst
of
sorrow
and
despondence
during
which
her
only
consolation
was
that
it
was
not
witnessed
by
berrendale
it
never
for
a
moment
entered
into
the
ingenuous
mind
of
adeline
that
her
declaration
would
have
more
weight
than
that
of
mary
warner
and
that
she
might
with
almost
a
certainty
of
being
believed
deny
her
charge
entirely
on
the
contrary
she
had
no
doubt
but
that
mrs
beauclerc
was
coming
to
inquire
into
the
grounds
for
mary
gross
address
and
she
was
resolved
to
confess
to
her
all
the
circumstances
of
her
story
after
church
in
the
afternoon
mrs
beauclerc
arrived
and
adeline
observed
with
pleasure
that
her
manner
was
even
kinder
than
usual
it
was
such
as
to
ensure
the
innocent
of
the
most
strenuous
support
and
to
invite
the
guilty
to
confidence
and
penitence
my
dear
miss
mowbray
said
mrs
beauclerc
i
call
on
you
with
more
readiness
than
now
as
i
come
assured
that
you
will
give
me
not
only
the
most
ample
authority
to
contradict
but
the
fullest
means
to
confute
the
vile
calumnies
which
that
malicious
girl
mary
warner
has
ever
since
she
entered
the
village
been
propagating
against
you
but
indeed
she
is
so
little
respected
in
her
rank
of
life
and
you
so
highly
in
yours
that
your
mere
denial
of
the
truth
of
her
statement
will
to
every
candid
mind
be
sufficient
to
clear
your
character
adeline
never
before
was
so
strongly
tempted
to
violate
the
truth
and
there
was
a
friendly
earnestness
in
mrs
beauclerc
manner
which
proved
that
it
would
be
almost
cruel
to
destroy
the
opinion
which
she
entertained
of
her
virtue
for
a
moment
adeline
felt
disposed
to
yield
to
the
temptation
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
and
in
a
hurried
and
broken
voice
she
replied
warner
has
asserted
of
me
nothing
but
here
her
voice
faltered
but
falsehoods
no
doubt
interrupted
mrs
beauclerc
triumphantly
thought
so
but
the
truth
resumed
adeline
cried
mrs
beauclerc
dropping
the
cold
hand
which
she
held
and
adeline
covering
her
face
and
throwing
herself
back
in
the
chair
sobbed
aloud
mrs
beauclerc
was
herself
for
some
time
unable
to
speak
but
at
length
she
faintly
said
sensible
so
pious
so
and
so
as
you
seem
to
what
strange
arts
what
wicked
seductions
did
you
fall
a
victim
no
arts
to
no
seductions
replied
adeline
recovering
all
her
energy
at
this
insinuation
against
glenmurray
fall
from
virtue
as
you
would
call
it
was
i
may
say
from
love
of
what
i
thought
virtue
and
if
there
be
any
blame
it
attaches
merely
to
my
confidence
in
my
lover
wisdom
and
my
own
too
obstinate
but
you
dear
madam
deserve
to
hear
my
whole
story
and
if
you
can
favour
me
with
an
hour
attention
i
hope
at
least
to
convince
you
that
i
was
worthy
of
a
better
fate
than
to
be
publicly
disgraced
by
a
malicious
and
ignorant
girl
mrs
beauclerc
promised
the
most
patient
attention
and
adeline
related
the
eventful
history
of
her
life
slightly
dwelling
on
those
parts
of
it
which
in
any
degree
reflected
on
her
mother
and
extolling
most
highly
her
sense
her
accomplishments
and
her
maternal
tenderness
when
she
came
to
the
period
of
glenmurray
illness
and
death
she
broke
abruptly
off
and
rushed
into
her
own
chamber
and
it
was
some
minutes
before
she
could
return
to
mrs
beauclerc
or
before
her
visitor
could
wish
her
to
return
as
she
was
herself
agitated
and
affected
by
the
relation
which
she
had
heard
and
when
adeline
came
in
she
threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
pressed
her
to
her
heart
with
a
feeling
of
affection
that
spoke
consolation
to
the
wounded
spirit
of
the
mourner
she
then
resumed
her
narration
and
having
concluded
it
mrs
beauclerc
seizing
her
hand
exclaimed
god
sake
marry
mr
berrendale
immediately
and
adjure
for
ever
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
those
errors
in
opinion
to
which
all
your
misery
has
been
owing
i
could
atone
for
them
some
other
way
she
replied
and
if
you
have
any
regard
for
me
you
will
become
the
wife
of
your
generous
lover
for
then
and
not
till
then
can
i
venture
to
associate
with
you
thought
so
cried
adeline
thought
all
idea
of
remaining
here
with
any
chance
of
keeping
my
scholars
was
now
impossible
would
not
be
so
replied
mrs
beauclerc
every
one
thought
like
me
i
should
consider
your
example
as
a
warning
to
all
young
people
and
to
preserve
my
children
from
evil
i
should
only
wish
them
to
hear
your
story
as
it
inculcates
most
powerfully
how
vain
are
personal
graces
talents
sweetness
of
temper
and
even
active
benevolence
to
ensure
respectability
and
confer
happiness
without
a
strict
regard
to
the
rules
for
conduct
and
a
continuance
in
those
paths
of
virtue
and
decorum
which
the
wisdom
of
ages
has
pointed
out
to
the
steps
of
every
but
others
will
no
doubt
consider
that
continuing
to
patronize
you
would
be
patronizing
vice
and
my
rank
in
life
is
not
high
enough
to
enable
me
to
countenance
you
with
any
chance
of
leading
others
to
follow
my
example
while
i
should
not
be
able
to
serve
you
but
should
infallibly
lose
myself
but
some
time
hence
as
the
wife
of
mr
berrendale
i
might
receive
you
as
your
merits
deserve
till
then
here
mrs
beauclerc
paused
and
she
hesitated
to
add
meet
no
more
indeed
it
was
long
before
the
parting
took
place
mrs
beauclerc
had
justly
appreciated
the
merits
of
adeline
and
thought
she
had
found
in
her
a
friend
and
companion
for
years
to
come
besides
her
children
were
most
fondly
attached
to
her
and
mrs
beauclerc
while
she
contemplated
their
daily
improvement
under
her
care
felt
grateful
to
adeline
for
the
unfolding
excellencies
of
her
daughters
still
to
part
with
her
was
unavoidable
but
the
pang
of
separation
was
in
a
degree
soothed
to
adeline
by
the
certainty
which
mrs
beauclerc
sorrow
gave
her
that
spite
of
her
errors
she
had
inspired
a
real
friendship
in
the
bosom
of
a
truly
virtuous
and
respectable
woman
and
this
idea
gave
a
sensation
of
joy
to
her
heart
to
which
it
had
long
been
a
stranger
the
next
morning
some
of
the
parents
whom
mary
tale
had
not
yet
reached
sent
their
children
as
usual
but
adeline
refused
to
enter
upon
any
school
duties
bidding
them
affectionately
farewell
and
telling
them
that
she
was
going
to
write
to
their
parents
as
she
was
obliged
to
leave
her
present
situation
and
declining
keeping
school
meant
to
reside
she
believed
in
london
the
children
on
hearing
this
looked
at
each
other
with
almost
tearful
consternation
and
adeline
observed
with
pleasure
the
interest
which
she
had
made
to
herself
in
their
young
hearts
after
they
were
gone
she
sent
a
circular
letter
to
her
friends
in
the
village
importing
that
she
was
under
the
necessity
of
leaving
her
present
residence
but
that
whatever
her
future
situation
might
be
she
should
always
remember
with
gratitude
the
favours
which
she
had
received
at
the
necessity
that
drove
her
away
was
by
this
time
very
well
understood
by
every
one
but
mrs
beauclerc
took
care
to
tell
those
who
mentioned
the
subject
to
her
the
heads
of
adeline
story
and
to
add
always
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
as
soon
as
she
is
settled
in
town
she
will
be
extremely
well
married
to
the
mulatto
the
change
in
adeline
plans
was
particularly
pleasing
as
it
would
bring
her
nearer
her
son
and
nearer
william
from
whom
nothing
but
a
sense
of
grateful
duty
to
adeline
would
so
long
have
divided
her
but
savanna
imagined
that
adeline
removal
was
owing
to
her
having
at
last
determined
to
marry
mr
berrendale
an
event
which
she
for
adeline
sake
earnestly
wished
to
take
place
though
for
her
own
she
was
undecided
whether
to
desire
it
or
not
as
mr
berrendale
might
not
perhaps
be
as
contented
with
her
services
as
adeline
was
while
these
thoughts
were
passing
in
savanna
mind
and
her
warm
and
varying
feelings
were
expressed
by
alternate
smiles
and
tears
mr
berrendale
arrived
from
town
and
as
savanna
opened
the
door
to
him
she
half
whimpering
half
smiling
dropped
him
a
very
respectful
curtsey
and
looked
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
unusual
significance
savanna
what
has
happened
anything
new
or
extraordinary
since
my
absence
said
berrendale
tink
not
of
wat
hav
appen
but
what
will
happen
replied
savanna
what
is
going
to
happen
returned
berrendale
seating
himself
in
the
parlour
where
is
your
mistress
dress
herself
that
dear
misses
replied
savanna
lingering
with
the
door
in
her
hand
i
ope
to
have
a
dear
massa
too
cried
berrendale
starting
wildly
from
his
seat
did
you
say
me
ope
my
misses
be
married
soon
to
whom
cried
berrendale
seizing
her
hand
and
almost
breathless
with
alarm
to
you
sure
exclaimed
savanna
den
me
hope
you
will
not
turn
away
poor
savanna
reason
you
have
my
dear
savanna
for
talking
thus
i
can
not
tell
nor
dare
i
give
way
to
the
sweet
hopes
which
you
excite
but
if
it
be
true
that
i
may
hope
depend
on
it
you
shall
cook
my
wedding
dinner
and
then
i
am
sure
it
will
be
a
good
one
full
joy
eat
asked
the
mulatto
thoughtfully
good
dinner
is
a
good
thing
savanna
replied
berrendale
ought
never
to
be
slighted
good
dinner
day
i
marry
but
i
not
eat
o
sir
pity
people
look
best
in
dere
wedding
clothes
but
my
william
look
well
all
day
and
every
day
and
perhaps
you
will
too
sir
and
den
i
ope
to
cook
your
wedding
dinner
next
day
dinner
and
all
your
dinners
so
you
shall
savanna
cried
berrendale
grasping
her
hand
i
here
the
door
opened
and
adeline
appeared
who
surprised
at
berrendale
familiarity
with
her
servant
looked
gravely
and
stopped
at
the
door
with
a
look
of
cold
surprise
berrendale
awed
into
immediate
respect
for
what
is
so
timid
and
respectful
as
a
man
truly
in
love
bowed
low
and
lost
in
an
instant
all
the
hopes
which
had
elevated
his
spirits
to
such
an
unusual
degree
adeline
with
an
air
of
pique
observed
that
she
feared
she
interrupted
them
unpleasantly
as
something
unusually
agreeable
and
enlivening
seemed
to
occupy
them
as
she
came
in
over
which
her
entrance
seemed
to
have
cast
a
cloud
the
mulatto
had
by
this
time
retreated
to
the
door
and
was
on
the
point
of
closing
it
when
berrendale
stammered
out
as
well
as
he
could
was
indeed
raising
my
hopes
to
such
an
unexpected
height
that
i
felt
almost
bewildered
with
joy
but
the
coldness
of
your
manner
miss
mowbray
has
sobered
me
again
what
did
savanna
say
to
you
cried
adeline
i
say
cried
savanna
returning
is
he
say
i
should
be
let
cook
de
wedding
dinner
adeline
returning
even
paler
than
she
was
before
desired
her
coldly
to
leave
the
room
and
seating
herself
at
the
greatest
possible
distance
from
berrendale
leaned
for
some
time
in
silence
on
her
hand
he
not
daring
to
interrupt
her
meditations
but
at
last
she
said
could
give
rise
to
this
singular
conversation
between
you
and
savanna
i
am
wholly
at
a
loss
to
imagine
still
i
i
must
own
that
it
is
not
so
as
it
would
have
been
some
weeks
ago
i
will
own
that
since
yesterday
i
have
been
considering
your
generous
proposals
with
the
serious
attention
which
they
deserve
on
hearing
this
which
adeline
uttered
with
considerable
effort
berrendale
in
a
moment
was
at
her
side
and
almost
at
her
feet
i
wish
you
to
return
to
your
seat
said
adeline
coldly
but
hope
had
emboldened
him
and
he
chose
to
stay
where
he
was
before
i
require
you
to
renew
your
promises
or
make
any
on
my
side
it
is
proper
that
i
should
tell
you
what
passed
yesterday
and
if
the
additional
load
of
obloquy
which
i
have
acquired
does
not
frighten
you
from
continuing
your
addresses
here
adeline
paused
and
berrendale
rather
drawing
back
then
pushing
his
chair
nearer
her
as
he
spoke
gravely
answered
that
his
affection
was
proof
against
all
trials
adeline
then
briefly
related
the
scene
in
the
and
her
conversation
with
mrs
beauclerc
and
concluded
thus
consequence
of
this
and
of
the
recollections
of
his
advice
and
his
decided
opinion
that
by
becoming
the
wife
of
a
respectable
man
i
could
alone
expect
to
recover
my
rank
in
society
and
consequently
my
usefulness
i
offer
you
my
hand
and
promise
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
to
become
yours
in
the
sight
of
god
and
man
from
no
other
reason
from
no
preference
no
regard
for
me
demanded
berrendale
reproachfully
pardon
me
from
decided
preference
there
is
not
another
being
in
the
creation
whom
i
could
bear
to
call
husband
berrendale
gratified
and
surprised
attempted
to
take
her
hand
but
withdrawing
it
she
continued
thus
i
almost
scruple
to
let
you
unblasted
as
your
prospects
are
take
a
wife
a
beggar
blasted
in
reputation
broken
in
spirits
with
a
heart
whose
best
affections
lie
buried
in
the
grave
and
which
can
offer
you
in
return
for
your
faithful
tenderness
nothing
but
cold
respect
and
esteem
one
too
who
is
not
only
despicable
to
others
but
also
while
adeline
said
this
berrendale
almost
shuddering
at
the
picture
which
she
drew
paced
the
room
in
great
agitation
and
even
the
gratification
of
his
passion
used
as
he
was
to
the
indulgence
of
every
wish
seemed
for
a
moment
a
motive
not
sufficiently
powerful
to
enable
him
to
unite
his
fate
to
that
of
a
woman
so
degraded
as
adeline
appeared
to
be
and
he
would
perhaps
have
hesitated
to
accept
the
hand
she
offered
had
she
not
added
as
a
contrast
to
the
picture
which
she
had
drawn
if
in
spite
of
all
these
unwelcome
considerations
you
persist
in
your
resolution
of
making
me
yours
and
i
have
resolution
enough
to
conquer
the
repugnance
that
i
feel
to
make
a
second
connexion
you
may
depend
on
possessing
in
me
one
who
will
study
your
happiness
and
wishes
in
the
minutest
particulars
one
who
will
cherish
you
in
sickness
and
in
sorrow
here
a
twinge
of
the
gout
assisted
appeal
very
powerfully
who
conscious
of
the
generosity
of
your
attachment
and
her
own
unworthiness
will
strive
by
every
possible
effort
not
to
remain
your
debtor
even
in
affection
saying
this
she
put
out
her
hand
to
berrendale
and
that
hand
and
the
arm
belonging
to
it
were
so
beautiful
and
he
had
so
often
envied
glenmurray
while
he
saw
them
tenderly
supporting
his
head
that
while
a
vision
of
approaching
gout
and
adeline
bending
over
his
restless
couch
floated
before
him
all
his
prudent
considerations
vanished
and
eagerly
pressing
the
proffered
hand
to
his
lips
he
thanked
her
most
ardently
for
her
kind
promise
and
putting
his
arm
round
her
waist
would
have
pressed
her
to
his
bosom
but
the
familiarity
was
adeline
was
already
surprised
and
even
shocked
at
the
lengths
to
which
she
had
gone
and
starting
almost
with
loathing
from
his
embrace
she
told
him
it
grew
late
and
it
was
time
for
him
to
go
to
his
lodgings
she
then
retired
to
her
own
room
and
spent
half
the
night
at
least
in
weeping
over
the
remembrance
of
glenmurray
and
in
loudly
apostrophizing
his
departed
spirit
the
next
day
adeline
out
of
the
money
which
she
had
earned
discharged
her
lodgings
and
having
written
a
farewell
note
to
mrs
beauclerc
begging
to
hear
of
her
now
and
then
she
and
the
mulatto
proceeded
to
town
with
berrendale
in
search
of
apartments
and
having
procured
them
adeline
began
to
consider
by
what
means
till
she
could
resolve
to
marry
berrendale
she
should
help
to
maintain
herself
and
also
contrive
to
increase
their
income
if
she
became
his
wife
the
success
which
she
had
met
with
in
instructing
children
led
her
to
believe
that
she
might
succeed
in
writing
little
hymns
and
tales
for
their
benefit
a
method
of
getting
money
which
she
looked
upon
to
be
more
rapid
and
more
lucrative
than
working
plain
or
fancy
works
and
in
a
short
time
a
little
volume
was
ready
to
be
offered
to
a
bookseller
nor
was
it
offered
in
vain
glenmurray
bookseller
accepted
it
and
the
sum
which
he
gave
though
trifling
imparted
a
balsam
to
the
wounded
mind
of
adeline
it
seemed
to
open
to
her
the
path
of
independence
and
to
give
her
in
spite
of
her
past
errors
the
means
of
serving
her
but
month
after
month
elapsed
and
glenmurray
had
been
dead
two
years
yet
still
adeline
could
not
prevail
on
herself
to
fix
a
time
for
her
marriage
but
next
to
the
aversion
she
felt
to
marrying
at
all
was
that
which
she
experienced
at
the
idea
of
having
no
fortune
to
bestow
on
the
disinterested
berrendale
and
so
desirous
was
she
of
his
acquiring
some
little
property
by
his
union
with
her
that
she
resolved
to
ask
counsel
opinion
on
the
possibility
of
her
claiming
a
sum
of
money
which
glenmurray
had
bequeathed
to
her
but
without
as
berrendale
had
assured
her
the
customary
formalities
the
money
was
near
but
berrendale
had
allowed
it
to
go
to
glenmurray
legal
heir
because
he
was
sure
that
the
writing
which
bequeathed
it
would
not
hold
good
in
law
still
adeline
was
so
unwilling
to
be
under
so
many
pecuniary
obligations
to
a
man
whom
she
did
not
love
that
she
resolved
to
take
advice
on
the
subject
much
against
the
will
of
berrendale
who
thought
the
money
for
fees
might
as
well
be
saved
but
as
a
chance
for
saving
the
fee
he
resolved
to
let
adeline
go
to
the
lawyer
chambers
alone
thinking
it
likely
that
no
fee
would
be
accepted
from
so
fine
a
woman
accordingly
more
alive
to
economy
than
to
delicacy
or
decorum
berrendale
when
adeline
desiring
a
coach
to
be
called
summoned
him
to
accompany
her
to
the
temple
pleaded
terror
of
an
impending
fit
of
the
gout
and
begged
her
to
excuse
his
attendance
and
adeline
unsuspicious
of
the
real
cause
of
his
refusal
kindly
expressing
her
sorrow
for
the
one
he
feigned
took
the
address
and
got
into
the
coach
berrendale
taking
care
to
tell
her
as
she
got
in
that
the
fare
was
but
a
shilling
the
gentleman
mr
langley
to
whom
adeline
was
going
was
celebrated
for
his
abilities
as
a
chamber
counsellor
and
no
less
remarkable
for
his
gallantries
but
berrendale
was
not
acquainted
with
this
part
of
his
history
else
he
would
not
even
to
save
a
lawyer
fee
have
exposed
his
intended
wife
to
a
situation
of
such
extreme
impropriety
and
adeline
was
too
much
a
stranger
to
the
rules
of
general
society
to
feel
any
great
repugnance
to
go
alone
on
an
errand
so
interesting
to
her
feelings
the
coach
having
stopped
near
the
entrance
of
the
court
to
which
she
was
directed
adeline
resolving
to
walk
home
discharged
the
coach
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
mr
langley
chambers
a
very
smart
servant
out
of
livery
answered
the
knock
and
mr
langley
being
at
home
adeline
was
introduced
into
his
apartment
mr
langley
though
surprised
at
seeing
a
lady
of
a
deportment
so
correct
and
of
so
dignified
an
appearance
enter
his
room
unattended
was
inspired
with
so
much
respect
at
the
sight
of
adeline
whose
mourning
habit
added
to
the
interest
which
her
countenance
never
failed
to
excite
that
he
received
her
with
bows
down
to
the
ground
and
leading
her
to
a
chair
begged
she
would
do
him
the
honour
to
be
seated
and
impart
her
commands
adeline
embarrassed
she
scarcely
knew
why
at
the
novelty
of
her
situation
drew
the
paper
from
her
pocket
and
presented
it
to
him
berrendale
recommended
me
to
you
sir
said
adeline
faintly
berrendale
o
aye
i
remember
the
cousin
of
mr
glenmurray
you
know
mr
glenmurray
too
i
presume
pray
how
is
he
adeline
unprepared
for
this
question
could
not
speak
and
the
voluble
counsellor
went
on
i
ask
your
pardon
madam
i
see
pray
might
i
presume
so
far
how
long
has
that
extraordinary
clever
man
been
lost
to
the
world
than
two
years
sir
replied
adeline
faintly
are
may
i
presume
so
far
you
are
his
widow
adeline
bowed
there
was
a
something
in
mr
langley
manner
and
look
so
like
sir
patrick
that
she
could
not
bear
to
let
him
know
she
was
only
glenmurray
companion
more
than
two
years
and
you
still
in
deep
mourning
amiable
susceptibility
how
unlike
the
wives
of
the
present
day
but
i
beg
now
to
business
so
saying
he
perused
the
paper
which
adeline
had
given
him
in
which
glenmurray
simply
stated
that
he
bequeathed
to
adeline
mowbray
the
sum
of
in
the
per
cents
but
it
was
signed
by
only
one
witness
do
you
wish
to
know
madam
asked
the
counsellor
this
will
be
valid
as
it
is
not
signed
by
two
witnesses
sir
really
not
replied
langley
the
if
we
have
either
equity
or
gallantry
could
certainly
not
refuse
to
fulfil
what
evidently
was
the
intention
of
the
testator
but
then
it
is
very
surprising
to
me
that
mr
glenmurray
should
have
wished
to
leave
any
thing
from
the
lady
whom
i
have
the
honour
to
behold
pray
madam
if
i
may
presume
to
ask
who
is
adeline
mowbray
i
am
adeline
mowbray
replied
adeline
in
great
confusion
madam
bless
me
i
presumed
and
pray
madam
if
i
may
make
so
bold
what
was
your
relationship
to
that
wonderfully
clever
man
his
niece
his
cousin
or
was
no
relation
of
his
said
adeline
still
more
confused
and
this
confusion
confirmed
the
suspicions
which
langley
entertained
and
also
brought
to
his
recollection
something
which
he
had
heard
of
having
a
very
elegant
and
accomplished
mistress
me
dear
madam
said
mr
langley
perceive
now
my
mistake
and
i
now
perceive
why
mr
glenmurray
was
so
much
the
envy
of
those
who
had
the
honour
of
visiting
at
his
house
my
soul
taking
her
hand
which
adeline
indignantly
withdrew
am
grieved
beyond
words
at
being
unable
to
give
you
a
more
favourable
opinion
you
said
sir
said
adeline
the
if
he
had
any
equity
would
certainly
be
guided
by
the
evident
intention
of
the
testator
did
madam
replied
the
lawyer
evidently
piqued
by
the
proud
and
cold
air
which
adeline
assumed
then
excuse
me
the
applicant
would
not
stand
much
chance
of
being
attended
to
who
is
neither
the
nor
of
mr
glenmurray
understand
you
sir
replied
adeline
need
trouble
you
no
longer
my
sweet
girl
returned
mr
langley
it
not
trouble
i
here
his
gallant
effusions
were
interrupted
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
a
very
showy
woman
highly
rouged
and
dressed
in
the
extremity
of
the
fashion
and
who
in
no
very
pleasant
tone
of
voice
exclaimed
fear
i
interrupt
you
not
in
the
least
replied
langley
blushing
even
more
than
adeline
fair
client
was
just
going
allow
me
madam
to
see
you
to
the
door
continued
he
attempting
to
take
adeline
hand
and
accompanying
her
to
the
bottom
of
the
first
flight
of
stairs
fine
woman
upon
my
soul
cried
he
speaking
through
his
shut
teeth
and
forcibly
squeezing
her
fingers
as
he
spoke
if
you
ever
want
advice
i
should
be
proud
to
see
you
here
with
a
significant
smile
here
adeline
too
angry
to
speak
put
the
fee
in
his
hand
which
he
insisted
on
returning
and
in
the
struggle
he
forcibly
kissed
the
ungloved
hand
which
was
held
out
praising
its
beauty
at
the
same
time
and
endeavouring
to
close
her
fingers
on
the
money
but
adeline
indignantly
threw
it
on
the
ground
and
rushed
down
the
remaining
staircase
the
lady
as
she
did
so
exclaim
is
not
that
black
mawkin
gone
yet
come
up
this
moment
you
devil
while
langley
obsequiously
replied
this
moment
my
angel
adeline
felt
so
disappointed
so
ashamed
and
so
degraded
that
she
walked
on
some
way
without
knowing
whither
she
was
going
and
when
she
recollected
herself
she
found
that
she
was
wandering
from
court
to
court
and
unable
to
find
the
avenue
to
the
street
down
which
the
coach
had
come
while
her
very
tall
figure
heightened
colour
and
graceful
carriage
made
her
an
object
of
attention
to
every
one
whom
she
met
at
last
she
saw
herself
followed
by
two
young
men
and
as
she
walked
very
fast
to
avoid
them
she
by
accident
turned
into
the
very
lane
which
she
had
been
seeking
but
her
pursuers
kept
pace
with
her
and
she
overheard
one
of
them
say
to
the
other
devilish
fine
girl
moves
well
too
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
i
have
seen
her
before
i
think
so
too
by
her
height
it
must
be
that
sweet
creature
who
lived
at
richmond
with
that
crazy
fellow
glenmurray
here
adeline
relaxed
in
her
pace
the
name
of
glenmurray
that
name
which
no
one
since
his
death
had
ventured
to
pronounce
in
her
presence
had
during
the
last
half
hour
been
pronounced
several
times
and
unable
to
support
herself
from
a
variety
of
emotions
she
stopped
and
leaned
for
support
against
the
wall
do
you
do
my
fleet
and
swift
girl
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
and
adeline
roused
at
the
insult
looked
at
him
proudly
and
angrily
and
walked
on
angry
if
i
may
be
so
bold
with
a
sneering
smile
creature
may
i
ask
where
you
live
now
sir
replied
adeline
are
wholly
unknown
to
me
were
you
to
tell
me
where
you
live
we
might
cease
to
be
strangers
pray
who
is
your
friend
now
here
as
his
companion
gave
way
to
a
loud
fit
of
laughter
adeline
clearly
understood
what
he
meant
by
the
term
and
summoning
up
all
her
spirit
she
called
a
coach
which
luckily
was
passing
and
turning
round
to
her
tormentor
with
great
dignity
said
the
situation
sir
in
which
i
once
was
may
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
in
yours
authorize
and
excuse
your
present
insulting
address
yet
when
i
tell
you
that
i
am
on
the
eve
of
marriage
with
a
most
respectable
man
i
trust
that
you
will
feel
the
impropriety
of
your
conduct
and
be
convinced
of
the
fruitlessness
and
impertinence
of
the
questions
which
you
have
put
to
me
this
be
the
case
madam
cried
the
gentleman
beg
your
pardon
and
shall
take
my
leave
wishing
you
all
possible
happiness
and
begging
you
to
attribute
my
impertinence
wholly
to
my
ignorance
so
saying
he
bowed
and
left
her
and
adeline
was
driven
to
her
lodgings
said
adeline
die
is
cast
i
have
used
the
sacred
name
of
wife
to
shield
me
from
insult
and
i
am
therefore
pledged
to
assume
it
directly
yes
he
was
right
i
find
i
must
have
a
legal
protector
she
found
berrendale
rather
alarmed
at
her
long
absence
and
with
a
beating
heart
she
related
her
adventures
to
him
but
when
she
said
that
langley
was
not
willing
to
take
the
fee
he
exclaimed
genteel
in
him
indeed
i
suppose
you
took
him
at
his
word
heavens
replied
adeline
you
think
i
would
deign
to
owe
such
a
man
a
pecuniary
obligation
no
indeed
i
threw
it
with
proud
indignation
on
the
floor
madness
returned
berrendale
had
much
better
have
put
it
in
your
pocket
berrendale
cried
adeline
gravely
and
with
a
look
bordering
on
contempt
trust
that
you
are
not
in
earnest
for
if
these
are
your
sentiments
if
this
is
your
delicacy
sir
no
more
dearest
of
women
replied
berrendale
pretending
to
laugh
alarmed
at
the
seriousness
with
which
she
spoke
could
you
for
one
moment
suppose
me
in
earnest
insolent
coxcomb
i
wish
i
had
been
there
wish
you
had
said
adeline
then
no
one
would
have
dared
to
insult
me
and
berrendale
delighted
at
this
observation
listened
to
the
rest
of
her
story
with
a
spirit
of
indignant
which
he
never
experienced
before
and
at
the
end
of
her
narration
he
felt
supremely
happy
for
adeline
assured
him
that
the
next
week
she
would
make
him
her
protector
for
life
and
this
assurance
opened
his
heart
so
much
that
he
vowed
he
would
not
condescend
to
claim
of
the
the
pitiful
sum
which
he
might
think
proper
to
withhold
to
be
adeline
kept
her
word
and
resolutely
struggling
with
her
feelings
she
became
the
next
week
the
wife
of
berrendale
for
the
first
six
months
the
union
promised
well
adeline
was
so
assiduous
to
anticipate
her
husband
wishes
and
contrived
so
many
dainties
for
his
table
which
she
cooked
with
her
own
hands
that
berrendale
declaring
himself
completely
happy
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
had
not
a
thought
or
a
wish
beyond
his
own
fireside
while
adeline
happy
because
she
conferred
happiness
and
proud
of
the
name
of
wife
which
she
had
before
despised
began
to
hope
that
her
days
would
glide
on
in
humble
tranquillity
it
was
natural
enough
that
adeline
should
be
desirous
of
imparting
this
change
in
her
situation
to
mrs
pemberton
whose
esteem
she
was
eager
to
recover
and
whose
kind
intentions
towards
her
at
a
moment
when
she
was
incapable
of
appreciating
them
savanna
had
with
great
feeling
expatiated
upon
she
therefore
wrote
to
her
according
to
the
address
which
mrs
pemberton
had
left
for
her
and
received
a
most
friendly
letter
in
return
in
a
short
time
adeline
had
again
an
expectation
of
being
a
mother
and
though
she
could
not
yet
entertain
for
her
husband
more
than
cold
esteem
she
felt
that
as
the
father
of
her
child
he
would
insensibly
become
more
dear
to
her
but
berrendale
awoke
from
his
dream
of
bliss
on
finding
to
what
a
large
sum
the
bills
for
the
housekeeping
amounted
nor
was
he
surprised
without
reason
adeline
more
eager
to
gratify
palate
than
considerate
as
to
the
means
had
forgotten
that
she
was
no
longer
at
the
head
of
a
liberal
establishment
like
her
mother
and
had
bought
for
the
supply
of
the
table
many
expensive
articles
in
consequence
of
this
terrible
discovery
berrendale
remonstrated
very
seriously
with
adeline
who
meekly
answered
dear
friend
good
dinners
can
not
be
had
without
good
ingredients
and
good
ingredients
can
not
be
had
without
money
madam
cried
berrendale
knitting
his
brows
but
not
elevating
his
voice
for
he
was
one
of
those
beings
who
in
the
sweetest
tones
possible
can
say
the
most
things
and
give
a
mortal
stab
to
your
in
the
same
gentle
manner
in
which
they
flatter
it
must
have
been
great
waste
great
mismanagement
here
or
these
expenses
could
not
have
been
incurred
may
have
been
both
returned
adeline
i
have
not
been
used
to
economize
but
i
will
try
to
learn
but
i
doubt
my
dear
berrendale
you
must
endeavour
to
be
contented
with
plainer
food
for
not
all
the
economy
in
the
world
can
make
rich
gravies
and
high
sauces
cheap
things
care
and
skill
can
do
much
said
berrendale
i
find
a
certain
person
deceived
me
very
much
when
he
said
you
were
a
good
manager
only
said
replied
adeline
sighing
deeply
i
was
a
good
cook
and
you
yourself
allow
that
but
i
hope
in
time
to
please
your
appetite
at
less
expense
as
to
myself
a
little
suffices
me
and
i
care
not
how
plain
that
food
is
i
think
i
have
seen
you
eat
with
a
most
excellent
appetite
said
berrendale
with
a
very
significant
expression
adeline
shocked
at
the
manner
more
than
the
words
replied
in
a
faltering
voice
a
proof
of
my
being
in
health
no
doubt
you
rejoiced
in
the
sight
but
less
robust
health
would
suit
our
finances
better
adeline
looked
up
wishing
though
not
expecting
to
see
by
his
face
that
he
was
joking
but
such
serious
displeasure
appeared
on
it
that
the
sordid
selfishness
of
his
character
was
at
once
unveiled
to
her
view
and
clasping
her
hands
in
agony
she
exclaimed
glenmurray
and
ran
into
her
own
room
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
pronounced
his
name
since
the
hour
of
his
death
and
now
it
was
wrung
from
her
by
a
sensation
of
acute
anguish
no
wonder
then
that
the
feelings
which
followed
completely
overcame
her
and
that
berrendale
had
undisputed
and
solitary
possession
of
his
supper
but
he
on
his
side
was
deeply
irritated
the
glenmurray
was
capable
of
being
interpreted
two
ways
either
it
showed
how
much
she
regretted
glenmurray
and
preferred
him
to
his
successor
in
spite
of
the
superior
beauty
of
his
person
of
which
he
was
very
vain
or
it
reproached
glenmurray
for
having
recommended
her
to
marry
him
in
either
case
it
was
an
unpardonable
fault
and
this
unhappy
conversation
laid
the
foundation
of
future
discontent
adeline
arose
the
next
day
dejected
pensive
and
resolved
that
her
appetite
should
never
again
if
possible
force
a
reproach
from
the
lips
of
her
husband
she
therefore
took
care
that
whatever
she
provided
for
the
table
besides
the
simplest
fare
should
be
for
berrendale
alone
and
she
flattered
herself
that
he
would
be
shamed
into
repentance
of
what
he
had
observed
by
seeing
her
scrupulous
she
even
resolved
if
he
pressed
her
to
partake
of
his
dainties
that
she
would
to
show
that
she
forgave
him
accept
what
he
offered
but
berrendale
gave
her
no
such
opportunity
of
showing
her
generosity
busy
in
the
gratification
of
his
own
appetite
he
never
observed
whether
any
other
persons
ate
or
not
except
when
by
eating
they
curtailed
his
share
of
good
things
besides
to
have
an
exclusive
dish
to
himself
seemed
to
him
quite
natural
and
proper
he
had
been
a
pampered
child
and
being
no
advocate
for
the
equality
of
the
sexes
he
thought
it
only
a
matter
of
course
that
he
should
fare
better
than
his
wife
adeline
though
more
surprised
and
more
shocked
than
ever
could
not
help
laughing
internally
at
her
not
being
able
to
put
her
projected
generosity
in
practice
but
her
laughter
and
indignation
soon
yielding
to
contempt
she
ate
her
simple
meal
in
silence
and
while
her
pampered
husband
sought
to
lose
the
fumes
of
indigestion
in
sleep
she
blessed
god
that
temperance
industry
and
health
went
and
retiring
to
her
own
room
sat
down
to
write
in
order
to
increase
if
possible
her
means
of
living
and
consequently
her
power
of
being
generous
to
others
but
though
adeline
resolved
to
forget
if
possible
the
petty
conduct
of
berrendale
the
mulatto
who
from
the
door
being
open
had
heard
every
word
of
the
conversation
which
had
so
disturbed
adeline
neither
could
nor
would
forget
it
and
though
she
did
not
vow
eternal
hatred
to
her
master
she
felt
herself
very
capable
of
indulging
it
and
from
that
moment
it
was
her
resolution
to
thwart
him
whenever
he
was
present
she
was
always
urging
adeline
to
eat
some
refreshments
between
meals
and
drink
wine
or
lemonade
and
tempting
her
weak
appetite
with
some
pleasant
but
expensive
sweetmeats
in
vain
did
adeline
refuse
them
sometimes
they
were
bought
sometimes
only
threatened
to
be
bought
and
once
when
adeline
had
accepted
some
rather
than
mortify
savanna
by
a
refusal
and
berrendale
by
his
accent
and
expression
showed
how
much
he
grudged
the
supposed
expense
the
mulatto
snapping
her
fingers
in
his
face
and
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
of
indignant
contempt
exclaimed
buy
dem
and
pay
for
dem
wid
mine
nown
money
and
my
angel
lady
sall
no
be
oblige
to
you
this
was
a
declaration
of
war
against
berrendale
which
adeline
heard
with
anger
and
sorrow
and
her
husband
with
rage
in
vain
did
adeline
promise
that
she
would
seriously
reprove
savanna
who
had
disappeared
for
her
impertinence
berrendale
insisted
on
her
being
discharged
immediately
and
nothing
but
adeline
assurances
that
she
for
slender
wages
did
more
work
than
two
other
servants
would
do
for
enormous
ones
could
pacify
his
displeasure
but
at
length
he
was
appeased
and
as
berrendale
from
a
principle
of
economy
resumed
his
old
habit
of
dining
out
amongst
his
friends
getting
good
dinners
by
that
means
without
paying
for
them
family
expenses
ceased
to
disturb
the
quiet
of
their
marriage
and
after
she
had
been
ten
months
a
wife
adeline
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
that
moment
the
moment
when
she
heard
her
infant
first
cry
seem
to
repay
her
for
all
she
had
suffered
every
feeling
was
lost
in
the
maternal
one
and
she
almost
fancied
that
she
loved
fondly
loved
the
father
of
her
child
but
this
idea
vanished
when
she
saw
the
languid
pleasure
if
pleasure
it
could
be
called
with
which
berrendale
congratulated
her
on
her
pain
and
danger
being
passed
and
received
his
child
in
his
arms
the
mulatto
was
wild
with
joy
she
almost
stifled
the
babe
with
her
kisses
and
talked
even
the
next
day
of
sending
for
the
tawny
boy
to
come
and
see
his
new
mistress
and
vow
to
her
as
he
had
done
to
her
mother
eternal
fealty
and
allegiance
but
adeline
saw
on
berrendale
countenance
a
mixed
expression
and
he
had
mixed
feelings
true
he
rejoiced
in
adeline
safety
but
he
said
within
himself
are
expensive
things
and
we
may
have
a
large
family
and
leaving
the
bedside
as
soon
as
he
could
he
retired
to
endeavour
to
lose
in
an
afternoon
nap
his
unpleasant
reflections
different
thought
adeline
have
been
his
feelings
and
his
expressions
of
them
at
such
a
time
oh
but
the
name
of
glenmurray
died
away
on
her
lips
and
hastily
turning
to
gaze
on
her
sleeping
babe
she
tried
to
forget
the
disappointed
emotions
of
the
wife
in
the
gratified
feelings
of
the
mother
still
adeline
who
had
been
used
to
attentions
could
not
but
feel
the
neglect
of
berrendale
even
while
she
kept
her
room
he
passed
only
a
few
hours
in
her
society
and
dined
out
and
when
she
was
well
enough
to
have
accompanied
him
on
his
visits
she
found
that
he
never
even
wished
her
to
go
with
him
though
the
friends
whom
he
visited
were
married
and
he
met
from
his
own
confessions
other
ladies
at
their
tables
she
therefore
began
to
suspect
that
berrendale
did
not
mean
to
introduce
her
as
his
wife
nay
she
doubted
whether
he
avowed
her
to
be
such
and
at
last
she
brought
him
to
own
that
ashamed
of
having
married
what
the
world
must
consider
as
a
kept
mistress
he
resolved
to
keep
her
still
in
the
retirement
to
which
she
was
habituated
this
was
a
severe
disappointment
indeed
to
adeline
she
longed
for
the
society
of
the
amiable
and
accomplished
of
her
own
sex
and
hoped
that
as
mr
berrendale
wife
that
intercourse
with
her
own
sex
might
be
restored
to
her
which
she
had
forfeited
as
the
mistress
of
glenmurray
nor
could
she
help
reproaching
berrendale
for
the
selfish
ease
and
indifference
with
which
he
saw
her
deprived
of
those
social
enjoyments
which
he
daily
enjoyed
himself
convinced
as
she
was
that
he
might
if
he
chose
have
introduced
her
at
least
to
his
intimate
friends
but
she
pleaded
and
reasoned
in
vain
contented
with
the
access
which
he
had
to
the
tables
of
his
friends
it
was
of
little
importance
to
him
that
his
wife
ate
her
humble
meal
alone
his
habits
of
enjoyment
had
ever
been
solitary
the
who
had
at
school
eaten
his
tart
and
cake
by
stealth
in
a
corner
that
he
might
not
be
asked
to
share
them
with
another
had
grown
up
with
the
same
dispositions
to
manhood
and
as
his
parents
thought
opulent
were
vulgar
in
their
manners
and
low
in
their
origin
he
had
never
been
taught
those
graceful
inculcated
into
the
children
of
polished
life
which
though
taught
from
factitious
and
not
real
benevolence
have
certainly
a
tendency
by
long
habit
to
make
that
benevolence
real
which
at
first
was
only
artificial
adeline
had
both
sorts
of
kindness
and
affection
those
untaught
of
the
heart
and
those
of
education
she
was
polite
from
the
situation
into
which
the
accident
of
birth
had
thrown
her
and
also
from
the
generous
impulse
of
her
nature
to
her
therefore
the
uncultivated
and
unblushing
as
the
french
call
it
of
berrendale
was
a
source
of
constant
wonder
and
distress
and
often
very
often
did
she
feel
the
utmost
surprise
at
berrendale
having
appeared
to
glenmurray
a
man
likely
to
make
her
happy
often
did
she
wonder
how
the
defects
of
berrendale
character
could
have
escaped
his
penetrating
eyes
adeline
forgot
that
the
faults
of
her
husband
were
such
as
could
be
known
only
by
an
intimate
connexion
and
which
cohabitation
could
alone
call
forth
faults
the
existence
of
which
such
a
man
as
glenmurray
who
never
considered
himself
in
any
transaction
whatever
could
not
suppose
possible
and
which
though
they
inflicted
the
most
bitter
pangs
on
adeline
and
gradually
untwisted
the
slender
thread
which
had
began
to
unite
her
heart
with
berrendale
were
of
so
slight
a
fabric
as
almost
to
elude
the
touch
and
of
a
nature
to
appear
almost
too
trivial
to
be
mentioned
in
the
narration
of
a
biographer
but
though
it
has
been
long
said
that
trifles
make
the
sum
of
human
things
inattention
to
trifles
continues
to
be
the
vice
of
every
one
and
many
a
conjugal
union
which
has
never
been
assailed
by
the
battery
of
crime
has
fallen
a
victim
to
the
slowly
undermining
power
of
petty
quarrels
trivial
unkindnesses
and
thoughtless
neglect
like
the
gallant
officer
who
after
escaping
unhurt
all
the
rage
of
battle
by
land
and
water
tempest
on
sea
and
earthquake
on
shore
returns
perhaps
to
his
native
country
and
perishes
by
the
power
of
a
slow
fever
but
adeline
who
amidst
all
the
chimaeras
of
her
fancy
and
singularities
of
her
opinions
had
happily
held
fast
her
religion
began
at
this
moment
to
entertain
a
belief
that
soothed
in
some
measure
the
sorrows
which
it
could
not
cure
she
fancied
that
all
the
sufferings
she
underwent
were
trials
which
she
was
doomed
to
undergo
as
punishments
for
the
crime
she
had
committed
in
leaving
her
mother
and
living
with
glenmurray
she
therefore
welcomed
her
afflictions
and
lifted
up
her
meek
eyes
to
her
god
and
saviour
in
every
hour
of
her
trials
with
the
look
of
tearful
but
grateful
resignation
meanwhile
her
child
whom
after
her
mother
she
called
editha
was
nursed
at
her
own
bosom
and
thrived
even
beyond
her
expectations
even
berrendale
beheld
its
growing
beauty
with
delight
and
the
mulatto
was
wild
in
praise
of
it
while
adeline
wholly
taken
up
all
day
in
nursing
and
in
working
for
it
and
every
evening
in
writing
stories
and
hymns
to
publish
which
would
she
hoped
one
day
be
useful
to
her
own
child
as
well
as
to
the
children
of
others
soon
ceased
to
regret
her
seclusion
from
society
and
by
the
time
editha
was
a
year
old
she
had
learnt
to
bear
with
patience
the
disappointment
she
had
experienced
in
berrendale
soon
after
she
became
a
mother
she
again
wrote
to
mrs
pemberton
as
she
longed
to
impart
to
her
sympathizing
bosom
those
feelings
of
parental
delight
which
berrendale
could
not
understand
and
the
expression
of
which
he
witnessed
with
contemptuous
and
chilling
gravity
to
this
letter
she
anticipated
a
most
gratifying
return
but
month
after
month
passed
away
and
no
letter
from
lisbon
arrived
doubt
my
letter
miscarried
said
adeline
to
savanna
i
will
write
again
but
she
never
had
resolution
to
do
so
for
she
felt
that
her
prospects
of
conjugal
happiness
were
obscured
and
she
shrunk
equally
from
the
task
of
expressing
the
comfort
which
she
did
not
feel
or
unveiling
to
another
the
errors
of
her
husband
the
little
regard
meanwhile
which
she
had
endeavoured
to
return
for
berrendale
soon
vanished
being
unable
to
withstand
a
new
violence
offered
to
it
editha
was
seized
with
the
and
as
adeline
had
sold
her
last
little
volume
to
advantage
berrendale
allowed
her
to
take
a
lodging
at
a
short
distance
from
town
as
change
of
air
was
good
for
the
complaint
she
did
so
and
remained
there
two
months
at
her
return
she
had
the
mortification
to
find
that
her
husband
during
her
absence
had
intrigued
with
the
servant
of
the
house
a
circumstance
of
which
she
would
probably
have
remained
ignorant
but
for
the
indiscreet
affection
of
savanna
who
in
the
first
transports
of
her
indignation
on
discovering
the
connexion
had
been
unable
to
conceal
from
her
mistress
what
drove
her
almost
frantic
with
indignation
but
adeline
though
she
felt
disgust
and
aversion
swallowing
up
the
few
remaining
sparks
of
regard
for
berrendale
which
she
felt
had
one
great
consolation
under
this
new
berrendale
had
not
been
the
choice
of
her
heart
thank
heaven
i
never
loved
this
man
escaped
her
lips
as
she
ran
into
her
own
room
and
pressing
her
child
to
her
bosom
she
shed
on
its
unconscious
cheeks
the
tears
which
resentment
and
a
deep
sense
of
injury
wrung
from
had
i
loved
him
she
exclaimed
blow
would
have
been
mortal
she
however
found
herself
in
one
respect
the
better
for
guilt
conscious
that
the
mulatto
was
aware
of
what
had
passed
and
afraid
lest
she
should
have
mentioned
her
discovery
to
adeline
berrendale
endeavoured
to
make
amends
for
his
infidelity
by
attention
such
as
he
had
never
shown
her
since
the
first
weeks
of
his
marriage
and
had
she
not
been
aware
of
the
motive
the
change
in
his
behaviour
would
have
her
tenderness
however
it
claimed
at
least
complaisance
and
gentleness
from
her
while
it
lasted
which
was
not
long
for
berrendale
fancying
from
the
apparent
tranquillity
of
adeline
the
result
of
indifference
not
ignorance
that
she
was
not
informed
of
his
fault
and
that
the
mulatto
was
too
prudent
to
betray
him
began
to
relapse
into
his
old
habits
and
one
day
forgetting
his
assumed
liberality
he
ventured
when
alone
with
savanna
who
was
airing
one
of
editha
caps
to
expatiate
on
the
needless
extravagance
of
his
wife
in
trimming
her
child
caps
with
lace
this
was
enough
to
rouse
the
quick
feelings
of
the
mulatto
and
she
poured
forth
all
her
long
concealed
wrath
in
a
torrent
of
broken
english
but
plain
enough
to
be
well
man
she
cried
at
last
will
kill
her
she
pine
at
your
no
kindness
and
if
she
die
mind
me
man
never
you
marry
you
marry
forsoot
you
marry
a
lady
true
bred
lady
like
mine
no
man
you
best
get
a
cheap
miss
from
de
street
and
be
content
as
she
said
this
and
in
an
accent
so
provoking
that
berrendale
was
pale
and
speechless
with
rage
adeline
entered
the
room
and
savanna
already
from
what
she
had
uttered
was
terrified
when
adeline
in
a
tone
of
voice
unusually
severe
said
the
room
you
have
offended
me
past
forgiveness
these
words
in
a
great
measure
softened
the
angry
feelings
of
berrendale
as
they
proved
that
adeline
resented
the
insult
offered
to
him
as
deeply
as
he
could
wish
and
with
some
calmness
he
exclaimed
i
conclude
mrs
berrendale
that
you
will
have
no
objection
to
discharge
your
mulatto
directly
this
conclusion
though
a
very
natural
one
was
both
a
shock
and
a
surprise
to
adeline
nor
could
she
at
first
reply
are
madam
said
berrendale
is
your
answer
yes
or
no
yes
certainly
faltered
out
adeline
she
ought
to
go
i
mean
that
she
has
used
very
improper
language
to
you
therefore
a
wife
who
resents
as
she
ought
to
do
injuries
offered
to
her
husband
can
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
to
discharge
her
very
true
in
some
measure
replied
adeline
what
demanded
berrendale
berrendale
cried
adeline
bursting
into
an
agony
of
frantic
sorrow
she
leaves
me
what
will
become
of
me
i
shall
lose
the
only
person
now
in
the
world
perhaps
who
loves
me
with
sincere
and
faithful
affection
berrendale
was
wholly
unprepared
for
an
appeal
like
this
and
speechless
from
surprise
not
unmixed
with
confusion
staggered
into
the
next
chair
he
was
conscious
indeed
that
his
fidelity
to
his
wife
had
not
been
proof
against
a
few
weeks
absence
but
then
being
like
most
men
not
over
delicate
in
his
idea
on
such
subjects
as
soon
as
adeline
returned
he
had
given
up
the
connexion
which
he
had
formed
and
therefore
he
thought
she
had
not
much
reason
to
complain
in
all
other
respects
he
was
sure
that
he
was
an
exemplary
husband
and
she
had
no
just
grounds
for
doubting
his
affection
he
was
sure
that
she
had
no
reason
to
accuse
him
of
unkindness
and
unless
she
wished
him
to
be
always
tied
to
her
he
was
certain
he
had
never
omitted
to
pay
her
all
proper
attention
alas
he
felt
not
the
many
wounds
he
had
inflicted
by
word
whose
meaning
kills
yet
told
the
speaker
wonders
that
you
thought
it
cold
and
he
had
yet
to
learn
that
in
order
to
excite
or
testify
affection
it
is
necessary
to
seem
to
derive
exclusive
enjoyment
from
the
society
of
the
object
avowed
to
be
beloved
and
to
seek
its
gratification
in
preference
to
one
own
even
in
the
most
trivial
things
he
knew
not
that
opportunities
of
conferring
large
benefits
like
for
rarely
come
into
use
but
little
attentions
friendly
participations
and
kindnesses
are
wanted
daily
and
like
small
change
are
necessary
to
carry
on
the
business
of
life
and
happiness
a
minute
more
perhaps
elapsed
before
berrendale
recovered
himself
sufficiently
to
speak
and
the
silence
was
made
still
more
awful
to
adeline
by
her
hearing
from
the
adjoining
room
the
sobs
of
the
mulatto
at
length
can
not
find
words
to
express
my
surprise
at
what
you
have
just
uttered
exclaimed
berrendale
conscience
does
not
reproach
me
with
deserving
the
reproof
it
contained
replied
adeline
fixing
her
penetrating
eyes
on
his
which
shrunk
downcast
and
abashed
from
her
gaze
adeline
saw
her
advantage
and
pursued
it
berrendale
continued
she
is
indeed
true
that
the
mulatto
has
offended
both
of
us
for
in
offending
she
has
offended
but
have
you
committed
no
fault
nothing
for
to
forgive
i
know
that
you
are
too
great
a
lover
of
truth
too
honourable
a
man
to
declare
that
you
have
not
deserved
the
just
anger
of
your
wife
but
you
know
that
i
have
never
reproached
you
nor
should
you
ever
have
been
aware
that
i
was
privy
to
the
distressing
circumstance
to
which
i
allude
but
for
what
has
just
passed
and
now
do
but
forgive
the
poor
mulatto
who
sinned
only
from
regard
for
me
and
from
supposed
slight
offered
to
her
mistress
and
i
will
not
only
assure
you
of
my
forgiveness
but
from
this
moment
will
strenuously
endeavour
to
blot
from
my
remembrance
every
trace
of
what
has
passed
berrendale
conscious
and
scarcely
knew
what
to
answer
but
thinking
that
it
was
better
to
accept
adeline
offer
even
on
her
own
conditions
he
said
that
if
savanna
would
make
a
proper
apology
and
adeline
would
convince
her
that
she
was
seriously
displeased
with
her
he
would
allow
her
to
stay
and
adeline
having
promised
every
thing
which
he
asked
peace
was
again
restored
what
can
you
mean
adeline
said
berrendale
doubting
my
affection
i
think
i
gave
a
sufficient
proof
of
that
when
disregarding
the
opinion
of
the
world
i
married
you
though
you
had
been
the
mistress
of
another
and
i
really
think
that
by
accusing
me
of
unkindness
you
make
me
a
very
ungrateful
return
to
this
indelicate
and
unfeeling
remark
adeline
vainly
endeavoured
to
reply
but
starting
from
her
chair
she
paced
the
room
in
violent
agitation
me
continued
berrendale
one
instance
in
which
i
have
been
unkind
to
you
adeline
suddenly
stopped
and
looking
steadfastly
at
him
smiled
with
a
sort
of
contemptuous
pity
and
was
on
the
point
of
saying
not
what
you
have
now
said
an
instance
of
unkindness
but
she
saw
that
the
same
want
of
delicacy
and
of
that
fine
moral
which
led
him
to
commit
this
and
similar
assaults
on
her
feelings
made
him
unconscious
of
the
violence
which
he
offered
finding
therefore
that
he
could
not
understand
her
causes
of
complaint
even
if
it
were
possible
for
her
to
define
them
she
replied
perhaps
i
was
too
hasty
and
in
a
degree
unjust
so
let
us
drop
the
subject
and
indeed
my
dear
berrendale
you
must
bear
with
my
weakness
remember
i
have
always
been
a
spoiled
child
here
the
image
of
glenmurray
and
that
of
the
home
which
she
once
knew
the
home
of
her
childhood
and
of
her
youth
pressed
on
her
recollection
she
thought
of
her
mother
of
the
indulgencies
which
she
had
once
known
of
the
advantages
of
opulence
the
value
of
which
she
had
never
felt
till
deprived
of
them
and
struck
with
the
comparative
forlornness
of
her
situation
united
for
life
to
a
being
whose
sluggish
sensibilities
could
not
understand
and
consequently
not
soothe
the
quick
feelings
and
jealous
susceptibility
of
her
nature
she
could
hardly
forbear
falling
at
the
feet
of
her
husband
and
conjuring
him
to
behave
at
least
with
forbearance
to
her
and
to
speak
and
look
at
her
with
kindness
she
did
stretch
out
her
hand
to
him
with
a
look
of
mournful
entreaty
which
though
not
understood
by
berrendale
was
not
lost
upon
him
entirely
he
thought
it
was
a
confession
of
her
weakness
and
his
superiority
and
flattered
by
the
thought
into
unusual
softness
he
caught
her
fondly
to
his
bosom
and
gave
up
an
engagement
to
sup
at
an
oyster
club
in
order
to
spend
the
evening
with
his
wife
nay
he
allowed
the
little
editha
to
remain
in
the
room
for
a
whole
hour
though
she
cried
when
he
attempted
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
observing
that
it
was
a
cold
evening
allowed
adeline
her
due
share
of
the
these
circumstances
trivial
as
they
were
had
more
than
their
due
effect
on
adeline
whose
heart
was
more
alive
to
kindness
than
unkindness
and
those
paltry
attentions
of
which
happy
wives
would
not
have
been
conscious
were
to
her
a
source
of
unfeigned
as
sailors
are
grateful
after
a
voyage
unexpectedly
long
for
the
muddy
water
which
at
their
first
embarking
they
would
have
turned
from
with
disgust
that
very
night
adeline
remonstrated
with
the
mulatto
on
the
impropriety
of
her
conduct
and
having
convinced
her
that
in
insulting
her
husband
she
failed
in
respect
to
her
savanna
was
prevailed
upon
the
next
morning
to
ask
pardon
of
berrendale
and
out
of
love
for
her
mistress
she
took
care
in
future
to
do
nothing
that
required
forgiveness
as
adeline
way
of
life
admitted
of
but
little
variety
berrendale
having
persisted
in
not
introducing
her
to
his
friends
on
the
plea
of
not
being
rich
enough
to
receive
company
in
return
i
shall
pass
over
in
silence
what
occurred
to
her
till
editha
was
two
years
old
premising
that
a
series
of
little
injuries
on
the
part
of
berrendale
and
a
quick
resentment
of
them
on
the
part
of
adeline
which
not
even
her
habitual
good
humour
could
prevent
had
during
that
time
nearly
eradicated
every
trace
of
love
for
each
other
from
their
hearts
one
evening
adeline
as
usual
in
the
absence
of
her
husband
undressed
editha
by
the
parlour
fire
and
playing
with
the
laughing
child
was
enjoying
the
rapturous
praises
which
savanna
put
forth
of
its
growing
beauty
while
the
tawny
boy
who
had
spent
the
day
with
them
built
houses
with
cards
on
the
table
which
editha
threw
down
as
soon
as
they
were
built
and
he
with
perseverance
raised
up
again
adeline
alive
only
to
the
maternal
feeling
at
this
moment
had
forgotten
all
her
cares
she
saw
nothing
but
the
happy
group
around
her
and
her
countenance
wore
the
expression
of
recovered
serenity
at
this
moment
a
loud
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
and
adeline
starting
up
exclaimed
is
my
husband
knock
no
he
never
come
so
soon
replied
the
mulatto
running
to
the
door
but
she
was
mistaken
it
was
berrendale
and
adeline
hearing
his
voice
began
instantly
to
snatch
up
editha
clothes
and
to
knock
down
the
tawny
boy
edifice
but
order
was
not
restored
when
berrendale
entered
and
with
a
look
and
tone
of
impatience
he
said
fine
confusion
indeed
here
a
to
come
to
pretty
amusement
too
for
a
literary
lady
building
houses
of
cards
shame
on
your
extravagance
mrs
berrendale
to
let
that
brat
spoil
cards
in
that
way
the
sunshine
of
adeline
countenance
on
hearing
this
vanished
to
be
sure
she
was
accustomed
to
such
speeches
but
the
moment
before
she
had
felt
happy
for
the
first
time
for
years
she
however
replied
not
but
hurrying
editha
to
bed
ordering
the
reluctant
tawny
boy
into
the
kitchen
and
setting
berrendale
chair
as
usual
in
the
warmest
place
she
ventured
in
a
faint
voice
to
ask
what
had
brought
him
home
so
early
early
than
welcome
replied
berrendale
i
may
judge
from
the
bustle
i
have
occasioned
is
very
true
replied
adeline
had
i
expected
you
i
should
have
been
better
prepared
for
your
reception
and
then
you
perhaps
would
have
spoken
more
kindly
to
me
there
you
go
if
i
say
but
a
word
to
you
then
i
am
called
unkind
though
i
never
speak
without
just
provocation
and
i
declare
i
came
home
in
the
best
humour
possible
to
tell
you
what
may
turn
out
of
great
profit
to
us
both
but
when
a
man
has
an
uncomfortable
home
to
come
to
it
is
enough
to
put
him
out
of
humour
the
mulatto
who
was
staying
to
gather
up
the
cards
which
had
fallen
turned
herself
round
on
hearing
this
and
exclaimed
was
very
comfortable
till
you
come
and
then
with
a
look
of
the
most
angry
contempt
she
left
the
room
and
threw
the
door
to
with
great
violence
what
is
this
good
news
my
dear
said
adeline
eager
to
turn
berrendale
attention
from
savanna
insolent
reply
have
received
a
letter
he
replied
by
the
by
i
ought
to
have
had
some
weeks
ago
from
my
in
jamaica
authorizing
me
to
draw
on
his
banker
for
and
inviting
me
to
come
over
to
him
as
he
feels
himself
declining
and
wishes
to
give
me
the
care
of
his
estate
and
of
my
son
to
whom
all
his
fortune
will
descend
and
of
whose
interest
he
properly
thinks
no
one
can
be
so
likely
to
take
good
care
as
his
own
father
do
you
mean
that
i
and
editha
should
go
with
you
said
adeline
turning
pale
to
be
sure
not
eagerly
replied
berrendale
must
first
see
how
the
land
lies
but
if
i
go
as
the
old
man
no
doubt
will
make
a
handsome
settlement
on
me
i
shall
be
able
to
remit
to
you
a
very
respectable
annuity
adeline
heart
spite
of
herself
bounded
with
joy
at
this
discovery
but
she
had
resolution
to
add
and
if
duplicity
can
ever
be
pardonable
this
was
then
the
good
news
which
you
had
to
impart
to
me
was
that
we
were
going
to
be
separated
but
as
she
said
this
the
consciousness
that
she
was
artfully
trying
to
impress
berrendale
with
an
idea
of
her
feeling
a
sorrow
which
was
foreign
to
her
heart
overcame
her
and
affected
also
at
being
under
the
necessity
of
rejoicing
at
the
departure
of
that
being
who
ought
to
be
the
source
of
her
comfort
she
vainly
struggled
to
regain
composure
and
burst
into
an
agony
of
tears
but
her
consternation
can
not
be
expressed
when
she
found
that
berrendale
imputed
her
tears
to
tender
anguish
at
the
idea
of
parting
with
him
and
when
his
vanity
being
delighted
by
this
homage
to
his
attractions
he
felt
all
his
fondness
for
her
revive
and
overwhelming
her
with
caresses
he
declared
that
he
would
reject
the
offer
entirely
if
by
accepting
it
he
should
give
her
a
moment
uneasiness
adeline
shocked
at
his
error
yet
not
daring
to
set
him
right
could
only
weep
on
his
shoulder
in
silence
but
in
order
to
make
real
the
distress
which
he
only
fancied
so
she
enumerated
to
herself
all
the
diseases
incident
to
the
climate
and
the
danger
of
the
voyage
still
the
idea
of
berrendale
departure
was
so
full
of
comfort
to
her
that
though
her
tears
continued
to
flow
they
flowed
not
for
his
approaching
absence
at
length
ashamed
of
fortifying
him
in
so
gross
an
error
she
made
an
effort
to
regain
her
calmness
and
found
words
to
assure
him
that
she
would
no
longer
give
way
to
such
unpardonable
weakness
as
she
could
assure
him
that
she
wished
his
acceptance
of
his
offer
and
had
no
desire
to
oppose
a
scheme
so
just
and
so
profitable
but
berrendale
to
whose
vanity
she
had
never
before
offered
such
a
tribute
as
her
tears
seemed
to
be
imputed
these
assurances
to
disinterested
love
and
female
delicacy
afraid
to
own
the
fondness
which
it
felt
and
the
rest
of
the
evening
was
spent
in
professions
of
love
on
his
part
which
on
adeline
called
forth
at
least
some
grateful
and
kind
expressions
in
return
still
however
she
persisted
in
urging
berrendale
to
go
to
jamaica
but
at
the
same
time
she
earnestly
begged
him
to
remember
that
temperance
could
alone
preserve
his
health
in
such
a
climate
the
use
of
pepper
in
great
quantities
replied
he
counteract
the
effects
of
good
living
and
adeline
though
convinced
temperance
was
the
preservation
was
forced
to
give
up
the
point
especially
as
berrendale
began
to
enumerate
the
number
of
delicious
things
for
the
table
which
jamaica
afforded
to
be
brief
berrendale
after
taking
a
most
affectionate
leave
of
his
wife
and
child
a
leave
which
almost
made
the
mulatto
his
friend
and
promising
to
allow
them
till
he
should
be
able
to
send
over
for
them
set
sail
for
jamaica
while
adeline
the
night
of
his
departure
endeavoured
by
conjuring
up
all
the
horrors
of
a
tempest
at
sea
on
his
passage
and
of
a
hurricane
and
an
earthquake
on
shore
when
he
arrived
to
force
herself
to
feel
such
sorrow
as
the
tenderness
which
he
had
expressed
at
the
moment
of
parting
seemed
to
make
it
her
duty
to
feel
but
morning
came
and
with
it
a
feeling
of
liberty
and
independence
so
delightful
that
she
no
longer
tried
to
grieve
on
speculation
as
it
were
but
giving
up
her
whole
soul
to
the
joys
of
maternal
fondness
she
looked
forward
with
pious
gratitude
to
days
of
tranquil
repose
save
when
she
thought
with
bitter
regret
of
the
obdurate
anger
of
her
mother
and
with
tender
regret
of
the
lost
and
ever
lamented
glenmurray
berrendale
had
been
arrived
at
jamaica
some
months
when
adeline
observed
a
most
alarming
change
in
savanna
she
became
thin
her
appetite
entirely
failed
and
she
looked
the
image
of
despondence
in
vain
did
adeline
ask
the
reason
of
a
change
so
apparent
the
only
answer
she
could
obtain
was
better
soon
and
continuing
every
day
to
give
this
answer
she
in
a
short
time
became
so
languid
as
to
be
obliged
to
lie
down
half
the
day
adeline
then
found
that
it
was
necessary
to
be
more
serious
in
her
interrogatories
but
the
mulatto
at
first
only
answered
me
die
but
me
never
break
my
duty
vow
to
you
no
me
die
but
never
leave
you
these
words
implying
a
wish
to
leave
her
with
a
resolution
not
to
do
so
how
much
soever
it
might
cost
her
alarmed
in
a
moment
the
ever
disinterested
sensibility
of
adeline
and
she
at
length
wrung
from
her
a
confession
that
her
dear
william
who
was
gone
to
jamaica
as
a
servant
to
a
gentleman
was
she
was
credibly
informed
very
ill
and
like
to
die
therefore
wish
to
go
and
nurse
him
i
suppose
savanna
me
no
wish
me
only
tink
dat

to
go
to

me

mean
savanna
for
indeed
i
can
not
spare
you
remember
you
have
given
me
a
right
to
claim
your
life
as
mine
nor
can
i
allow
you
to
throw
away
my
property
in
fruitless
lamentations
and
the
indolent
indulgence
of
regret
you
shall
go
to
jamaica
savanna
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
keep
a
wife
from
her
duty
you
shall
see
and
try
to
recover
william
if
he
be
really
ill
savanna
here
threw
herself
on
adeline
neck
then
you
shall
return
to
me
who
will
either
warmly
share
in
your
satisfaction
or
fondly
sooth
your
distress
you
do
love
poor
savanna
you
indeed
i
do
next
to
my
child
and
and
my
mother
replied
adeline
her
voice
faltering
not
dat
woman
cried
savanna
hastily
will
never
see
never
speak
to
her
even
in
heaven
remember
she
is
my
mother
and
mr
berrendale
be
your
husban
and
yet
who
dat
love
you
can
love
dem
replied
adeline
proofs
of
your
regard
though
reprehensible
are
not
likely
to
reconcile
me
to
your
departure
and
i
already
feel
that
in
losing
you
here
she
paused
unable
to
proceed
me
no
go
me
no
go
yet
dearest
lady
you
have
love
yourself
savanna
and
can
feel
for
you
so
say
no
more
the
only
difficulty
will
be
to
raise
money
enough
to
pay
for
your
passage
and
expenses
while
there
me
once
nurse
the
captain
wife
who
now
going
to
jamaica
and
she
love
me
very
much
and
he
tell
me
yesterday
that
he
let
me
go
for
nothing
because
i
am
good
nurse
to
his
wife
if
me
wish
to
see
william
replied
adeline
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
provide
you
with
money
for
your
maintenance
when
you
arrive
and
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
what
i
can
not
supply
the
tawny
boy
generous
patroness
will
adeline
was
not
mistaken
savanna
obtained
from
her
son
benefactress
a
sum
equal
to
her
wants
and
almost
instantly
restored
to
her
wonted
health
by
her
mind
being
lightened
of
the
load
which
oppressed
it
she
took
her
passage
on
board
her
friend
vessel
and
set
sail
for
jamaica
carrying
with
her
letters
from
adeline
to
berrendale
while
adeline
felt
the
want
of
savanna
in
various
ways
so
forcibly
that
not
even
editha
could
for
a
time
at
least
console
her
for
her
loss
it
had
been
so
grateful
to
her
feelings
to
meet
every
day
the
eyes
of
one
being
fixed
with
affection
on
hers
that
when
she
beheld
those
eyes
no
longer
she
felt
alone
in
the
universe
nor
had
she
a
single
female
friend
to
whom
she
could
turn
for
relief
or
consolation
mrs
beauclerc
to
whose
society
she
had
expected
to
be
restored
by
her
marriage
had
been
forced
to
give
up
all
intercourse
with
her
in
compliance
with
the
peremptory
wishes
of
a
rich
old
maid
from
whom
her
children
had
great
expectations
and
who
threatened
to
leave
her
fortune
away
from
them
if
mrs
beauclerc
persisted
in
corresponding
with
a
woman
so
bad
in
principle
and
so
wicked
in
practice
as
adeline
appeared
to
her
to
be
but
at
length
from
a
mother
employments
from
writing
and
above
all
from
the
idea
that
by
suffering
she
was
making
some
atonement
for
her
past
sins
she
derived
consolation
and
became
resigned
to
every
evil
that
had
befallen
and
to
every
evil
that
might
still
befall
her
perhaps
she
did
not
consider
as
an
evil
what
now
took
place
increasing
coldness
in
the
letters
of
berrendale
till
he
said
openly
at
last
that
as
they
were
he
was
forced
to
confess
far
from
happy
together
and
as
the
air
of
jamaica
agreed
with
him
and
as
he
was
resolved
to
stay
there
he
thought
she
had
better
remain
in
england
and
he
would
remit
her
as
much
money
occasionally
as
his
circumstances
would
admit
of
but
she
thought
this
a
greater
evil
than
it
at
first
appeared
when
an
agent
of
berrendale
in
england
and
a
friend
of
berrendale
himself
called
on
her
pretending
that
he
came
to
inquire
concerning
her
health
and
raised
in
her
mind
suspicions
of
a
very
painful
nature
after
the
usual
compliments
find
madam
said
mr
drury
our
friend
is
very
much
admired
by
the
ladies
in
jamaica
am
glad
to
hear
it
sir
coolly
answered
adeline
that
kind
and
generous
now
replied
drury
very
disinterested
see
no
virtue
sir
in
my
rejoicing
of
what
must
make
mr
abode
in
jamaica
pleasant
to
him
be
so
but
most
women
i
believe
would
be
apt
to
be
jealous
on
the
occasion
it
has
been
the
study
of
my
life
sir
to
endeavour
to
consider
my
own
interest
when
it
comes
in
competition
with
another
as
little
as
possible
i
doubt
i
have
not
always
succeeded
in
my
endeavours
but
on
this
occasion
i
am
certain
that
i
have
expressed
no
sentiment
which
i
do
not
feel
madam
if
my
friend
should
have
an
opportunity
as
indeed
i
believe
he
has
of
forming
a
most
agreeable
and
advantageous
marriage
you
would
not
try
to
prevent
it
heavens
sir
replied
adeline
can
you
mean
mr
berrendale
form
an
advantageous
marriage
when
he
is
already
married
to
me
to
you
answered
mr
drury
with
a
look
of
incredulity
me
but
i
know
that
such
marriages
as
yours
may
be
easily
dissolved
at
first
adeline
was
startled
at
this
assertion
but
recollecting
that
it
was
impossible
any
form
or
ceremony
should
have
been
wanting
at
the
marriage
she
recovered
herself
and
demanded
with
an
air
of
severity
what
mr
drury
meant
by
so
alarming
and
a
speech
meaning
replied
he
be
pretty
evident
to
you
i
mean
that
i
do
not
look
upon
you
though
you
bear
mr
berrendale
name
to
be
his
lawful
wife
but
that
you
live
with
him
on
the
same
terms
on
which
you
lived
with
mr
glenmurray
on
what
sir
could
you
build
such
an
erroneous
supposition
mr
berrendale
own
words
madam
who
always
spoke
of
his
connexion
with
you
as
of
a
connexion
which
he
had
formed
in
compliance
with
love
and
in
defiance
of
prudence
is
it
possible
that
he
could
be
such
a
villain
exclaimed
adeline
my
child
and
does
thy
father
brand
thee
with
the
stain
of
illegitimacy
but
sir
whatever
appellation
mr
berrendale
might
choose
to
give
his
union
with
me
to
his
friends
in
england
i
am
sure
he
will
not
dare
to
incur
the
penalty
attendant
on
a
man
marrying
one
wife
while
he
has
another
living
for
that
i
am
his
wife
i
can
bring
pretty
sufficient
evidence
to
prove
madam
you
can
produce
a
witness
of
the
ceremony
then
i
presume
sir
the
woman
who
attended
me
to
the
altar
and
the
clergyman
who
married
us
are
dead
and
the
only
witness
is
a
child
now
only
ten
years
old
is
unfortunate
with
a
look
of
incredulity
no
doubt
when
you
hear
that
mr
berrendale
is
married
to
a
west
indian
heiress
you
will
come
forward
with
incontrovertible
proofs
of
your
prior
claims
and
if
you
do
that
madam
you
may
command
my
good
offices
but
till
then
i
humbly
take
my
leave
saying
this
with
a
very
visible
sneer
on
his
countenance
he
departed
leaving
adeline
in
a
state
of
distress
the
more
painful
to
endure
from
her
having
none
to
participate
in
it
no
one
to
whom
she
could
impart
the
cause
of
it
that
mr
drury
did
not
speak
of
the
possible
marriage
of
berrendale
from
mere
conjecture
was
very
apparent
and
adeline
resolved
not
to
delay
writing
to
her
husband
immediately
to
inform
him
of
what
had
passed
and
put
before
his
eyes
in
the
strongest
possible
manner
the
guilt
of
what
he
was
about
to
do
and
also
the
utter
impossibility
of
its
being
successful
guilt
as
she
was
resolved
to
assert
her
claims
for
the
sake
of
her
child
if
not
for
her
own
this
letter
she
concluded
and
with
truth
too
with
protestations
of
believing
all
mr
drury
said
to
be
false
for
indeed
the
more
she
considered
berrendale
character
the
more
she
was
convinced
that
however
selfish
and
defective
his
disposition
might
be
it
was
more
likely
mr
drury
should
be
mistaken
than
berrendale
be
a
villain
but
where
a
man
conduct
is
not
founded
on
virtuous
motives
and
immutable
principles
he
may
not
err
while
temptation
is
absent
but
once
expose
him
to
her
presence
and
he
is
capable
of
falling
into
the
very
vices
the
most
abhorrent
to
his
nature
and
though
adeline
knew
it
not
such
a
man
was
berrendale
adeline
having
relieved
her
mind
by
this
appeal
to
her
husband
and
being
assured
that
berrendale
could
not
be
married
before
her
letter
could
reach
him
as
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
dare
to
marry
while
the
mulatto
was
in
the
very
town
near
which
he
resided
felt
herself
capable
of
attending
to
her
usual
employments
again
and
had
recovered
her
tranquillity
when
an
answer
to
her
letter
arrived
and
adeline
being
certain
that
the
letter
itself
would
be
a
proof
of
the
marriage
had
resolved
to
show
it
in
justification
of
her
claims
to
mr
drury
what
then
must
have
been
her
surprise
to
find
it
exactly
such
a
letter
as
would
be
evidence
against
a
marriage
between
her
and
berrendale
having
ever
taken
place
he
thanked
her
for
the
expressions
of
fond
regret
which
her
letter
contained
and
for
the
many
happy
hours
which
he
owed
to
her
society
but
hoped
that
as
fate
had
now
separated
their
destinies
she
could
be
as
happy
without
him
as
she
had
been
with
him
and
assuring
her
that
he
should
according
to
his
promise
regularly
remit
her
if
possible
but
that
he
could
at
present
only
inclose
a
draft
for
adeline
was
absolutely
stupified
with
horror
at
reading
this
apparent
confirmation
of
the
villany
of
her
husband
and
the
father
of
her
child
but
roused
to
indignant
exertion
by
the
sense
of
berrendale
baseness
and
of
what
she
owed
her
daughter
she
resolved
to
take
opinion
in
what
manner
she
should
proceed
to
prove
her
marriage
as
soon
as
she
was
assured
that
berrendale
which
she
had
no
doubt
was
fixed
upon
should
have
taken
place
and
this
intelligence
she
received
a
short
time
after
the
mulatto
herself
who
worn
out
with
sorrow
sickness
and
hardship
one
day
tottered
into
the
house
seeming
as
if
she
indeed
only
returned
to
die
with
her
mistress
at
first
the
joy
of
seeing
savanna
restored
to
her
swallowed
up
every
other
feeling
but
tender
apprehension
for
the
poor
creature
health
soon
took
possession
of
her
mind
and
adeline
drew
from
her
a
narrative
which
exhibited
berrendale
to
her
eyes
as
capable
of
most
atrocious
actions
chapter
xix
it
is
very
certain
that
when
berrendale
left
england
though
he
meant
to
conceal
his
marriage
entirely
he
had
not
even
the
slightest
wish
to
contract
another
and
had
any
one
told
him
that
he
was
capable
of
such
wicked
conduct
he
would
have
answered
like
hazael
thy
servant
a
dog
that
he
should
do
this
thing
but
he
was
then
unassailed
by
temptations
and
habituated
as
he
was
to
selfish
indulgence
it
was
impossible
that
to
strong
temptation
he
should
not
fall
an
immediate
victim
this
strong
temptation
assailed
him
soon
after
his
arrival
in
the
person
of
a
very
lovely
and
rich
widow
a
relation
of
his
first
wife
who
having
no
children
of
her
own
had
long
been
very
fond
of
his
child
then
a
very
fine
boy
and
with
great
readiness
transferred
to
the
father
the
affection
which
she
bore
the
son
for
some
time
conscience
and
adeline
stood
their
ground
against
this
new
mistress
and
her
immense
property
but
at
length
being
pressed
by
his
who
wished
the
match
to
assign
a
sufficient
reason
for
his
coldness
to
so
fine
a
woman
and
not
daring
to
give
the
true
one
he
returned
the
fondness
and
though
he
had
not
yet
courage
enough
to
name
the
marriage
day
it
was
known
that
it
would
some
time
or
other
take
place
but
all
his
scruples
soon
yielded
to
the
dominion
which
the
attractions
of
the
lady
who
was
well
versed
in
the
arts
of
seduction
obtained
over
his
senses
and
to
the
strong
power
which
the
sight
of
the
splendour
in
which
she
lived
acquired
over
his
avarice
when
just
as
every
thing
was
on
the
point
of
being
concluded
the
poor
mulatto
who
had
found
her
husband
dead
arrived
almost
at
the
place
of
abode
and
delivered
to
him
letters
from
adeline
terrified
and
confounded
at
her
presence
he
received
her
with
such
evident
marks
of
guilty
confusion
in
his
face
that
apprehensive
and
suspicious
attachment
to
her
mistress
took
the
alarm
and
as
she
had
seen
a
very
fine
woman
leave
the
room
as
she
entered
she
on
pretence
of
leaving
berrendale
alone
to
read
his
letters
repaired
to
the
servants
apartments
where
she
learnt
the
intended
marriage
immediately
forgetting
her
own
distresses
in
those
of
adeline
she
returned
to
berrendale
not
with
the
languid
mournful
pace
with
which
she
had
first
entered
but
with
the
firm
impetuous
and
intrepid
step
of
conscious
integrity
going
to
confound
vice
in
the
moment
of
its
triumph
berrendale
read
his
doom
the
moment
he
beheld
her
in
her
dark
and
fiery
eye
and
awaited
in
trembling
silence
the
torrent
of
reproaches
that
trembled
on
her
lip
but
i
shall
not
repeat
what
passed
suffice
that
berrendale
pretended
to
be
moved
by
what
she
said
and
promised
to
break
off
the
marriage
only
exacting
from
savanna
in
return
a
promise
of
not
imparting
to
the
servants
or
to
any
one
that
he
had
a
wife
in
england
in
the
meanwhile
he
commended
her
most
affectionately
to
the
care
of
the
steward
and
confessing
to
his
intended
bride
that
he
had
a
mistress
in
england
who
had
sent
the
mulatto
over
to
prevent
the
match
if
possible
by
persuading
her
he
was
already
married
he
conjured
her
to
consent
to
a
private
marriage
and
to
prevent
some
dreadful
scene
occasioned
by
the
revenge
of
disappointed
passion
should
his
mistress
as
she
had
threatened
come
over
in
person
he
entreated
her
to
let
every
splendid
preparation
for
their
nuptials
be
laid
aside
in
order
to
deceive
savanna
and
induce
her
to
return
quietly
to
england
the
credulous
woman
too
much
in
love
to
believe
what
she
did
not
wish
consented
to
all
he
proposed
but
berrendale
still
fearful
of
the
watchful
jealousy
of
savanna
contrived
to
find
out
the
master
to
whom
she
belonged
before
she
had
escaped
early
in
life
with
her
first
husband
to
england
and
as
she
had
never
been
made
free
as
soon
as
he
arrived
he
on
a
summons
from
berrendale
seized
her
as
his
property
and
poor
savanna
in
spite
of
her
cries
and
struggles
was
conveyed
some
miles
up
the
country
at
length
however
she
found
means
to
escape
to
the
coast
and
having
discovered
an
old
acquaintance
in
an
english
sailor
on
board
a
vessel
then
ready
to
sail
and
who
had
great
influence
with
the
captain
she
was
by
him
concealed
on
board
with
the
approbation
of
the
commander
and
was
on
her
way
to
england
before
berrendale
was
informed
of
her
escape
i
will
not
endeavour
to
describe
adeline
feelings
on
hearing
this
narration
and
on
finding
also
that
savanna
before
she
left
the
island
had
been
assured
that
berrendale
was
really
married
though
privately
but
that
the
marriage
could
not
long
be
attempted
to
be
concealed
as
the
lady
even
before
it
took
place
was
likely
to
become
a
mother
and
that
as
a
large
estate
depended
on
her
giving
birth
to
a
son
the
event
of
her
confinement
was
looked
for
with
great
anxiety
still
in
the
midst
of
her
distress
a
sudden
thought
struck
adeline
which
converted
her
anger
into
joy
and
her
sorrow
into
exultation
my
mother
may
now
forgive
me
without
violating
any
part
of
her
oath
she
am
now
forsaken
despised
and
disgraced
and
instantly
she
wrote
to
mrs
mowbray
a
letter
calculated
to
call
forth
all
her
sympathy
and
affection
then
with
a
mind
relieved
beyond
expression
she
sat
down
to
deliberate
in
what
manner
she
should
act
to
do
herself
justice
as
a
wife
and
a
mother
cruelly
aggrieved
in
both
these
intimate
relations
nor
could
she
persuade
herself
that
she
should
act
properly
by
her
child
if
she
did
not
proceed
vigorously
to
prove
herself
berrendale
wife
and
substantiate
editha
claim
to
his
property
and
as
mr
langley
was
she
knew
a
very
great
lawyer
she
resolved
in
spite
of
his
improper
conduct
to
her
to
apply
to
him
again
indeed
she
could
not
divest
herself
of
a
wish
to
let
him
know
that
she
was
become
a
wife
and
no
longer
liable
to
be
treated
with
that
freedom
with
which
as
a
mistress
he
had
thought
himself
at
liberty
to
address
her
however
she
wished
that
she
had
not
been
obliged
to
go
to
him
alone
but
as
the
mulatto
was
in
too
weak
a
state
of
health
to
allow
of
her
going
out
and
she
could
not
speak
of
business
like
hers
before
any
one
else
she
was
forced
to
proceed
unaccompanied
to
the
temple
and
on
the
evening
of
the
day
after
savanna
return
she
with
a
beating
heart
repaired
once
more
to
mr
langley
chambers
luckily
however
she
met
the
tawny
boy
on
her
way
and
took
him
for
her
escort
your
master
said
she
to
the
servant
mrs
berrendale
wishes
to
speak
to
him
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
introduced
berrendale
cried
langley
with
a
sarcastic
smile
be
seated
madam
i
hope
mr
berrendale
is
well
is
in
jamaica
sir
replied
adeline
returned
langley
i
presume
so
far
as
to
ask
hem
hem
whether
your
visit
to
me
be
merely
of
a
professional
nature
sir
replied
adeline
what
other
nature
should
it
be
langley
replied
to
this
only
by
a
significant
smile
at
this
moment
the
tawny
boy
asked
leave
to
walk
in
the
temple
gardens
and
adeline
though
reluctantly
granted
his
request
à
propos
john
cried
langley
to
the
servant
mrs
montgomery
know
that
her
friend
miss
mowbray
mrs
berrendale
i
mean
is
here
she
is
walking
in
the
garden
friend
mrs
montgomery
sir
i
have
no
friend
of
that
name
my
sweet
soul
you
may
not
know
her
by
that
name
but
names
change
you
know
you
for
instance
are
mrs
berrendale
now
but
when
i
see
you
again
you
may
be
mrs
somebody
else
sir
cried
adeline
indignantly
though
i
do
not
exactly
understand
your
meaning
i
feel
as
if
you
meant
to
insult
me
and
therefore
no
sit
down
again
my
angel
you
are
mistaken
and
so
apt
to
fly
off
in
a
tangent
but
so
that
wonderfully
handsome
man
berrendale
is
off
heh
your
friend
and
mine
heh
pretty
one
sir
mr
berrendale
ever
considered
you
as
his
friend
it
is
very
strange
that
you
should
presume
to
insult
his
wife
replied
langley
with
a
most
provoking
sneer
wife
shall
always
be
treated
by
me
with
proper
respect
heaven
cried
adeline
clasping
her
hands
and
looking
upwards
with
tearful
eyes
shall
my
persecutions
cease
and
how
much
greater
must
my
offences
be
than
even
my
remorse
paints
them
when
their
consequences
still
torment
me
so
long
after
the
crime
which
occasioned
them
has
ceased
to
exist
but
it
is
thy
will
and
i
will
submit
even
to
indignity
with
patience
there
was
a
touching
solemnity
in
this
appeal
to
heaven
an
expression
of
truth
which
it
was
so
impossible
for
art
to
imitate
that
langley
felt
in
a
moment
the
injustice
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
and
an
apology
was
on
his
lips
when
the
door
opened
and
a
lady
rouged
like
a
french
countess
of
the
ancien
régime
her
hair
covered
with
a
profusion
of
brown
powder
and
dressed
in
the
height
of
fashion
ambled
into
the
room
and
saying
d
do
miss
mowbray
threw
herself
carelessly
on
the
sofa
to
the
astonishment
of
adeline
who
did
not
recollect
her
and
to
the
confusion
of
langley
who
now
impressed
with
involuntary
respect
for
adeline
repented
of
having
exposed
her
to
the
scene
that
awaited
her
but
to
prevent
it
was
impossible
he
was
formed
to
be
a
slave
of
woman
and
had
not
courage
to
protect
another
from
the
insolence
to
which
he
tamely
yielded
himself
adeline
at
first
did
not
answer
this
acquaintance
of
hers
but
in
looking
at
her
more
attentively
she
exclaimed
do
i
see
is
it
possible
that
this
can
be
mary
warner
it
is
my
dear
indeed
replied
she
with
a
loud
laugh
warner
alias
mrs
montgomery
as
you
you
know
are
miss
mowbray
alias
mrs
berrendale
adeline
incapable
of
speaking
only
gazed
at
her
in
silence
but
with
countenance
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
come
sit
down
my
dear
cried
mary
ceremony
you
know
among
friends
and
equals
you
know
and
you
and
i
have
been
mighty
familiar
you
know
before
now
the
last
time
we
met
you
called
me
you
know
yes
woman
says
you
and
i
have
not
forgotten
it
i
assure
you
she
added
with
a
sort
of
loud
hysterical
laugh
and
a
look
of
the
most
determined
malice
come
my
dear
montgomery
said
langley
must
forget
and
forgive
i
dare
say
miss
mowbray
that
is
to
say
mrs
berrendale
did
not
mean
should
you
know
about
the
matter
replied
mary
wish
you
would
mind
your
own
business
and
let
me
talk
to
my
dumb
friend
well
i
suppose
you
are
quite
surprised
to
see
how
smart
i
am
seeing
as
how
i
once
overheard
you
say
to
glenthingymy
how
very
plain
mary
is
though
to
be
sure
it
was
never
a
barrel
the
better
herring
and
was
the
kettle
in
my
mind
calling
the
pot
heh
here
was
the
clue
to
the
inveterate
dislike
which
this
unhappy
girl
had
conceived
against
adeline
so
true
is
it
that
little
wounds
inflicted
on
the
are
never
forgotten
or
forgiven
and
that
it
is
safer
to
censure
the
morals
of
acquaintances
than
to
ridicule
them
on
their
dress
or
laugh
at
a
defect
in
their
person
adeline
indeed
did
not
mean
that
her
observation
should
be
overheard
by
the
object
of
it
still
she
was
hated
but
many
persons
make
mortifying
remarks
purposely
and
yet
wonder
that
they
have
enemies
motionless
and
almost
lifeless
adeline
continued
to
stand
and
to
listen
and
mary
went
on
but
i
thank
you
for
one
thing
you
taught
me
that
marriage
was
all
nonsense
you
know
and
so
thought
i
miss
mowbray
is
a
learned
lady
she
must
know
best
and
so
i
followed
your
example
that
all
you
know
this
dreadful
information
roused
the
feelings
of
adeline
even
to
phrensy
and
with
a
shriek
of
anguish
she
seized
her
hand
and
conjured
her
by
all
her
hopes
of
mercy
to
retract
what
she
had
said
and
not
to
let
her
depart
with
the
horrible
consciousness
of
having
been
the
means
of
plunging
a
into
vice
and
infamy
a
loud
unfeeling
laugh
and
an
exclamation
of
woman
is
mad
was
all
the
answer
to
this
then
is
the
completion
of
my
sufferings
cried
adeline
only
was
wanted
to
complete
the
misery
of
my
remorse
is
too
much
exclaimed
langley
you
know
very
well
that
your
tongue
lang
you
know
nothing
about
the
matter
it
is
all
nothing
but
that
miss
mowbray
like
a
lawyer
can
change
sides
you
see
and
attack
one
day
what
she
defended
the
day
before
you
know
and
she
has
made
you
believe
that
she
thinks
now
being
kept
a
shameful
thing
do
believe
so
hastily
replied
adeline
if
it
be
true
that
my
sentiments
and
my
example
led
you
to
adopt
your
present
guilty
mode
of
life
oh
save
me
from
the
pangs
of
remorse
which
i
now
feel
by
letting
my
present
example
recall
you
from
the
paths
of
error
to
those
of
virtue
pleaded
cried
the
mary
you
could
not
have
so
well
not
up
to
that
montgomery
said
langley
with
great
severity
you
can
not
treat
mrs
berrendale
with
more
propriety
and
respect
i
must
beg
you
to
leave
the
room
she
is
come
to
speak
to
me
on
business
and
stir
for
all
that
and
mark
me
if
you
turn
me
out
of
the
room
you
know
hang
me
if
ever
i
enter
it
again
your
little
boy
may
want
you
you
have
left
him
now
some
time
that
may
be
true
to
be
sure
poor
little
dear
have
you
any
family
miss
mowbray
when
without
waiting
for
an
answer
she
added
little
boy
have
got
the
very
bad
and
has
been
likely
to
die
from
convulsion
fits
you
know
poor
dear
i
had
been
nursing
it
so
long
that
i
could
not
bear
the
stench
of
the
room
and
so
i
was
glad
you
know
to
come
and
get
a
little
fresh
air
in
the
gardens
at
this
speech
adeline
fortitude
entirely
gave
way
child
had
not
had
the
and
she
had
been
for
some
minutes
in
reach
of
the
infection
and
with
a
look
of
horror
forgetting
her
business
and
every
thing
but
editha
she
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
room
when
a
servant
hastily
entered
and
told
mary
that
her
little
boy
was
dead
at
hearing
this
even
her
cold
heart
was
moved
and
throwing
herself
back
on
the
sofa
she
fell
into
a
strong
hysteric
while
adeline
losing
all
remembrance
of
her
insolence
in
her
distress
flew
to
her
assistance
and
in
pity
for
a
mother
weeping
the
loss
of
her
infant
forgot
for
a
moment
that
she
was
endangering
the
life
of
her
own
child
mr
langley
mean
time
though
grieved
for
the
death
of
the
infant
was
alive
to
the
generous
forgiving
disposition
which
adeline
evinced
and
could
not
help
exclaiming
mrs
berrendale
forgive
us
we
deserved
not
such
kindness
at
your
hands
and
adeline
wanting
to
loosen
the
tight
stays
of
mary
and
not
choosing
to
undress
her
before
such
a
witness
coldly
begged
him
to
withdraw
advising
him
at
the
same
time
to
go
and
see
whether
the
child
was
really
dead
as
it
might
possibly
only
appear
so
revived
by
this
possibility
mr
langley
left
mary
to
the
care
of
adeline
and
left
the
room
but
whether
it
was
that
mary
had
a
mind
to
impress
her
lover
and
the
father
of
her
child
with
an
idea
of
her
sensibility
or
whether
she
had
overheard
adeline
supposition
certain
it
is
that
as
soon
as
langley
went
away
and
adeline
began
to
unlace
her
stays
she
hastily
recovered
and
declared
her
stays
should
remain
as
they
were
but
still
exclaiming
about
her
poor
dear
benny
she
kept
her
arms
closely
clasped
round
adeline
waist
and
reposed
her
head
on
her
bosom
adeline
fears
and
pity
for
her
being
thus
allayed
she
began
to
have
leisure
to
feel
and
fear
for
herself
and
the
idea
that
by
being
in
such
close
contact
with
mary
she
was
imbibing
so
much
of
the
disease
as
must
inevitably
communicate
it
to
editha
recurred
so
forcibly
to
her
mind
that
begging
for
mercy
sake
she
would
loose
her
hold
she
endeavoured
to
break
from
the
arms
of
her
tormentor
but
in
as
soon
as
mary
saw
that
adeline
wished
to
leave
her
she
was
the
more
eager
to
hold
her
fast
and
protesting
she
should
die
if
she
had
the
barbarity
to
leave
her
alone
she
only
hugged
her
the
closer
then
i
try
to
stay
till
mr
langley
returns
cried
adeline
but
some
minutes
elapsed
and
mr
langley
did
not
return
and
then
adeline
recollecting
that
when
he
did
return
he
would
come
fresh
fraught
with
the
pestilence
from
the
dead
body
of
his
infant
could
no
longer
master
her
feelings
but
screaming
wildly
shall
be
the
death
of
my
child
let
me
go
she
struggled
with
the
determined
mary
will
drive
me
mad
if
you
detain
me
cried
adeline
will
drive
me
mad
if
you
go
replied
mary
giving
way
to
a
violent
hysterical
scream
while
with
successful
strength
she
parried
all
adeline
endeavours
to
break
from
her
but
what
can
resist
the
strength
of
phrensy
and
despair
adeline
at
length
worked
up
to
madness
by
the
fatal
control
exercised
over
her
by
one
great
effort
threw
the
sobbing
mary
from
her
and
darting
down
stairs
with
the
rapidity
of
phrensy
nearly
knocked
down
mr
langley
in
her
passage
who
was
coming
to
announce
the
restoration
of
the
little
boy
she
soon
reached
and
was
on
her
road
home
before
langley
and
mary
had
recovered
their
consternation
but
she
suddenly
recollected
that
homewards
she
must
not
proceed
that
she
carried
death
about
her
and
wholly
bewildered
by
this
insupportable
idea
she
ran
along
the
strand
muttering
the
incoherencies
of
phrensy
as
she
went
till
she
was
intercepted
in
her
passage
by
some
young
men
of
who
had
been
dining
together
and
being
half
intoxicated
were
on
their
way
to
the
theatre
two
of
these
gentlemen
with
extended
arms
prevented
her
further
progress
are
you
going
my
pretty
girl
cried
one
this
hurry
shall
i
see
you
home
heh
replied
adeline
it
not
my
child
my
child
thy
mother
has
destroyed
thee
cried
another
by
all
that
tragical
me
exclaimed
adeline
wildly
not
you
know
poor
babe
that
i
carry
death
and
infection
about
with
me
devil
you
do
returned
the
gentleman
the
sooner
you
take
yourself
off
the
better
believe
the
poor
soul
is
mad
said
a
third
making
way
for
adeline
to
pass
cried
the
first
who
spoke
catching
hold
of
her
so
there
is
method
and
meaning
in
her
madness
for
she
called
jaby
here
a
poor
babe
and
we
all
know
he
is
little
better
by
this
time
adeline
was
in
a
state
of
complete
phrensy
and
was
again
darting
down
the
street
in
spite
of
the
gentleman
efforts
to
hold
her
when
another
gentleman
whom
curiosity
had
induced
to
stop
and
listen
to
what
passed
suddenly
seized
hold
of
her
arm
and
exclaimed
heavens
what
can
this
mean
it
is
it
can
be
no
other
than
miss
mowbray
at
the
sound
of
her
own
name
adeline
started
but
in
a
moment
her
senses
were
quite
lost
again
and
the
gentleman
who
was
no
other
than
colonel
mordaunt
being
fully
aware
of
her
situation
after
reproving
the
young
men
for
sporting
with
distress
so
apparent
called
a
coach
which
happened
to
be
passing
and
desired
to
know
whither
he
should
have
the
honour
of
conducting
her
but
she
was
too
lost
to
be
able
to
answer
the
question
he
therefore
lifting
her
into
the
coach
desired
the
man
to
drive
towards
and
when
there
he
ordered
him
to
drive
to
when
not
being
able
to
obtain
one
coherent
word
from
adeline
and
nothing
but
expressions
of
agony
terror
and
he
desired
him
to
stop
at
such
a
house
and
conducting
adeline
up
stairs
desired
the
first
assistance
to
be
procured
immediately
it
was
not
to
his
own
lodgings
that
colonel
mordaunt
had
conducted
adeline
but
to
the
house
of
a
convenient
friend
of
his
who
though
not
generally
known
as
such
and
bearing
a
tolerably
good
character
in
the
world
was
very
kind
to
the
tender
distresses
of
her
friends
and
had
no
objection
to
assist
the
meetings
of
two
fond
lovers
it
is
to
be
supposed
then
that
she
was
surprised
at
seeing
colonel
mordaunt
with
a
companion
who
was
an
object
of
pity
and
horror
rather
than
of
love
but
she
did
not
want
humanity
and
when
the
colonel
recommended
adeline
to
her
tenderest
care
she
with
great
readiness
ordered
a
bed
to
be
prepared
and
assisted
in
prevailing
on
adeline
to
lie
down
on
it
in
a
short
time
a
physician
and
a
surgeon
arrived
and
adeline
having
been
bled
and
made
to
swallow
strong
opiates
was
undressed
by
her
attentive
landlady
and
though
still
in
a
state
of
unconsciousness
she
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
which
lasted
till
morning
but
colonel
mordaunt
passed
a
sleepless
night
the
sight
of
adeline
even
frantic
and
wretched
as
she
appeared
had
revived
the
passion
which
he
had
conceived
for
her
and
if
on
her
awaking
the
next
morning
she
should
appear
perfectly
rational
and
her
phrensy
merely
the
result
of
some
great
fright
which
she
had
received
he
resolved
to
renew
his
addresses
and
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
now
offered
him
while
she
was
as
it
were
in
his
power
but
to
return
to
the
soon
after
mr
langley
had
entered
his
own
room
and
while
mary
and
he
were
commenting
on
the
frantic
behaviour
of
adeline
the
tawny
boy
came
back
from
his
walk
and
heard
with
marks
of
emotion
apparently
beyond
his
age
for
though
near
twelve
he
did
not
look
above
eight
years
old
of
the
sudden
and
frantic
disappearance
of
adeline
my
dear
friend
cried
he
you
are
not
gone
home
you
will
break
my
poor
mother
heart
who
is
your
mother
name
is
savanna
and
she
lives
with
mrs
berrendale
berrendale
cried
mary
mowbray
you
mean
i
do
not
her
name
was
mowbray
but
is
now
berrendale
is
she
really
married
asked
langley
to
be
sure
how
do
you
know
that
she
is
because
i
went
to
church
with
them
and
my
mother
cooked
the
and
i
ate
and
drank
punch
and
we
were
very
merry
only
my
mother
cried
because
my
father
could
not
come
circumstantial
evidence
indeed
cried
langley
i
am
very
sorry
that
i
did
not
know
so
much
before
so
you
and
your
mother
love
this
extraordinary
fine
woman
mrs
berrendale
heh
her
to
be
sure
we
should
be
very
wicked
if
we
did
not
did
you
never
hear
the
story
of
the
pineapple
said
the
tawny
boy
i
what
was
it
and
the
tawny
boy
delighted
to
tell
the
story
with
sparkling
eyes
sat
down
to
relate
it
must
know
mr
glenmurray
longed
for
a
pineapple
glenmurray
you
mean
said
mary
laughing
immoderately
know
what
i
say
replied
the
tawny
boy
angrily
so
miss
adeline
as
she
was
then
called
went
out
to
buy
one
well
and
so
she
met
my
poor
father
going
to
prison
and
i
was
crying
after
her
and
so
here
he
paused
and
bursting
into
tears
exclaimed
perhaps
she
is
crying
herself
now
and
i
must
go
and
see
for
her
directly
so
my
fine
fellow
cried
langley
had
better
go
home
tell
your
mother
what
has
passed
and
accompanying
him
down
stairs
and
speaking
in
a
low
voice
will
either
write
a
note
of
apology
or
call
on
mrs
berrendale
myself
the
tawny
boy
instantly
set
off
running
as
fast
as
he
could
telling
langley
first
that
if
any
harm
had
happened
to
his
friend
both
he
and
his
mother
should
lie
down
and
die
and
this
further
proof
of
merit
did
not
tend
to
calm
langley
remorse
for
having
exposed
her
to
the
various
distresses
which
she
had
undergone
at
his
chambers
chapter
xx
adeline
awoke
early
the
next
morning
perfectly
sane
though
weakened
by
the
exertions
which
she
had
experienced
the
night
before
and
saw
with
surprise
and
alarm
that
she
was
not
in
her
own
lodging
but
she
had
scarcely
convinced
herself
that
she
was
awake
when
mrs
selby
the
mistress
of
the
house
appeared
at
her
and
seeing
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
by
her
countenance
explained
to
her
as
delicately
as
she
could
the
situation
in
which
she
had
been
brought
there
who
brought
me
hither
replied
adeline
dreadfully
agitated
as
the
remembrance
of
what
had
passed
by
degrees
burst
upon
her
mordaunt
of
the
guards
was
the
answer
and
adeline
was
shocked
to
find
that
he
was
the
person
to
whom
she
was
under
so
essential
an
obligation
she
then
hastily
arose
being
eager
to
return
home
and
in
a
short
time
she
was
ready
to
enter
the
and
to
express
her
thanks
to
colonel
mordaunt
but
in
vain
did
she
insist
on
going
home
directly
to
ease
the
fears
of
her
family
the
physician
who
arrived
at
the
moment
forbade
her
going
out
without
having
first
taken
both
medicine
and
refreshment
and
by
the
time
that
after
the
most
earnest
entreaties
she
obtained
leave
to
depart
she
recollected
that
as
her
clothes
were
the
same
she
might
still
impart
disease
to
her
child
and
therefore
must
on
no
account
think
of
returning
to
editha
whither
then
can
i
go
cried
she
forgetting
she
was
not
alone
not
stay
here
said
the
colonel
who
had
been
purposely
left
alone
with
her
dearest
of
women
that
you
would
but
accept
the
protection
of
a
man
who
adores
you
who
has
long
loved
you
who
has
been
so
fortunate
as
to
rescue
you
from
a
situation
of
misery
and
danger
and
the
study
of
whose
life
it
shall
be
to
make
you
happy
he
uttered
this
with
such
volubility
that
adeline
could
not
find
an
opportunity
to
interrupt
him
but
when
he
concluded
she
calmly
replied
am
willing
to
believe
colonel
mordaunt
from
a
conversation
which
i
once
had
with
you
that
you
are
not
aware
of
the
extent
of
the
insult
which
you
are
now
offering
to
me
you
probably
do
not
know
that
i
have
been
for
years
a
married
woman
colonel
mordaunt
started
and
turned
pale
at
this
intelligence
and
in
a
faltering
voice
replied
that
he
was
indeed
a
stranger
to
her
present
situation
for
that
libertine
as
he
confessed
himself
to
be
he
had
never
yet
allowed
himself
to
address
the
wife
of
another
this
speech
restored
him
immediately
to
the
confidence
of
adeline
i
hope
cried
she
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
which
in
spite
of
his
virtue
he
passionately
kissed
as
a
friend
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
procure
me
a
coach
to
take
me
to
a
lodging
a
few
miles
out
of
town
where
i
once
was
before
and
that
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
drive
directly
to
my
lodgings
and
let
my
poor
maid
know
what
is
become
of
me
i
dread
to
think
added
she
bursting
into
tears
the
agony
that
my
unaccountable
absence
must
have
occasioned
her
the
colonel
too
seriously
attached
to
adeline
to
know
yet
what
he
wished
or
what
he
hoped
on
this
discovery
of
her
situation
promised
to
obey
her
provided
she
would
allow
him
to
call
on
her
now
and
then
and
adeline
was
too
full
of
gratitude
to
him
for
the
service
which
he
had
rendered
her
to
have
resolution
enough
to
deny
his
request
he
then
called
a
coach
for
himself
and
for
adeline
as
she
insisted
on
his
going
immediately
to
her
lodgings
and
also
begged
that
he
would
tell
the
mulatto
to
send
for
advice
and
prepare
her
little
girl
for
inoculation
directly
adeline
drove
directly
to
her
old
lodgings
in
the
country
where
she
was
most
gladly
received
and
the
colonel
went
to
deliver
his
commission
to
the
mulatto
he
found
her
in
strong
hysterics
the
tawny
boy
crying
over
her
and
the
woman
of
the
house
holding
her
down
on
the
bed
by
force
while
the
little
editha
had
been
conveyed
to
a
neighbour
house
that
she
might
not
hear
the
screams
which
had
surprised
and
terrified
her
colonel
mordaunt
had
opened
the
door
and
was
witnessing
this
distressing
scene
before
any
one
was
conscious
of
his
presence
but
the
tawny
boy
soon
discovered
him
and
crying
out
sir
do
you
bring
us
news
of
our
friend
sprang
to
him
and
hung
almost
breathless
on
his
arm
savanna
who
was
conscious
enough
to
know
what
passed
though
too
much
weakened
from
her
own
sufferings
and
anxieties
to
be
able
to
struggle
with
this
new
affliction
started
up
on
hearing
these
words
and
screamed
out
she
live
blessed
man
but
say
so
dat
all
in
a
tone
so
affecting
and
with
an
expression
of
agonized
curiosity
so
overwhelming
to
the
feelings
that
colonel
mordaunt
whose
spirits
were
not
very
high
was
so
choked
that
he
could
not
immediately
answer
her
and
when
at
last
he
faltered
out
lives
and
is
quite
well
the
frantic
joy
of
the
mulatto
overcame
him
still
more
she
jumped
about
his
neck
she
hugged
the
tawny
boy
and
her
delight
was
as
extravagant
as
her
grief
had
been
till
exhausted
and
silent
she
sunk
upon
the
bed
and
was
unable
for
some
minutes
to
listen
quietly
to
the
story
which
colonel
mordaunt
came
to
relate
when
she
was
composed
enough
to
listen
to
it
she
did
not
long
remain
so
for
as
soon
as
she
heard
that
colonel
mordaunt
had
met
adeline
in
her
phrensy
and
conveyed
her
to
a
place
of
safety
she
fell
at
his
feet
embraced
his
knees
and
making
the
tawny
boy
kneel
down
by
her
invoked
the
blessing
of
god
on
him
so
fervently
and
so
eloquently
that
colonel
mordaunt
wept
like
a
child
and
exclaiming
my
soul
my
good
woman
i
can
not
bear
this
was
forced
to
run
out
of
the
house
to
recover
his
emotion
when
he
returned
savanna
said
now
blessed
sir
take
me
to
my
dear
lady
replied
he
must
not
you
are
forbidden
to
see
her
replied
she
her
eyes
flashing
fire
who
dare
to
keep
savanna
from
her
own
mistress
i
will
see
her
if
she
forbids
it
savanna
and
if
her
child
life
should
be
endangered
by
it
no
to
be
sure
not
cried
the
tawny
boy
who
doted
upon
editha
and
having
fetched
her
back
from
the
next
house
was
lulling
her
to
sleep
in
his
arms
colonel
mordaunt
started
at
sight
of
the
child
and
stooping
down
to
kiss
its
rosy
cheek
sighed
deeply
as
he
turned
away
again
cried
savanna
talk
very
strange
me
no
understand
you
shall
my
excellent
creature
replied
the
colonel
he
then
entered
on
a
full
explanation
to
savanna
who
had
no
sooner
heard
that
her
mistress
feared
that
she
had
been
so
much
exposed
to
the
infection
of
the
as
to
make
her
certain
of
giving
it
to
her
child
than
she
exclaimed
my
good
god
save
and
protect
her
own
self
she
never
have
it
and
she
may
get
it
and
die
you
must
be
mistaken
replied
the
colonel
berrendale
must
have
recollected
and
mentioned
her
own
danger
if
this
be
the
case
hastily
interrupted
the
mulatto
tink
of
herself
never
she
only
mind
others
good
do
you
tink
if
she
be
one
selfish
beast
like
her
husban
savanna
love
her
so
dear
no
mr
colonel
me
know
her
and
me
know
though
we
may
save
the
child
we
may
lose
the
mother
here
she
began
to
weep
bitterly
while
the
colonel
more
in
love
than
ever
with
adeline
from
these
proofs
of
her
goodness
resolved
to
lose
no
time
in
urging
her
to
undergo
herself
the
operation
which
she
desired
for
editha
then
begging
the
mulatto
to
send
for
a
surgeon
directly
in
spite
of
the
tears
of
the
tawny
boy
who
thought
it
cruel
to
run
the
risk
of
spoiling
miss
editha
pretty
face
he
took
his
leave
saying
to
himself
a
heart
has
this
adeline
how
capable
of
feeling
affection
for
no
one
can
inspire
it
who
is
not
able
to
feel
it
and
this
creature
is
thrown
away
on
a
man
undeserving
her
it
seems
on
this
intelligence
he
continued
to
muse
till
he
arrived
at
lodgings
to
whom
he
communicated
all
that
had
passed
and
from
whom
he
learned
with
great
anxiety
that
it
was
but
too
true
that
she
had
never
had
the
and
that
therefore
she
should
probably
show
symptoms
of
the
disease
in
a
few
days
consequently
as
she
considered
it
too
late
for
her
to
be
inoculated
she
should
do
all
that
now
remained
to
be
done
for
her
security
by
low
living
and
good
air
that
same
evening
colonel
mordaunt
returned
to
savanna
in
hopes
of
learning
from
her
some
further
particulars
respecting
adeline
husband
as
he
felt
that
his
conscience
would
not
be
much
hurt
by
inducing
adeline
to
leave
the
protection
of
a
man
who
was
unworthy
of
possessing
her
fortunately
for
his
wishes
he
could
not
wish
to
hear
more
than
savanna
wished
to
tell
every
thing
relating
to
her
adored
lady
and
colonel
mordaunt
heard
with
generous
indignation
of
the
perfidious
conduct
of
berrendale
vowing
at
the
same
time
that
his
time
his
interest
and
his
fortune
should
all
be
devoted
to
bring
such
a
villain
to
justice
and
to
secure
to
the
injured
editha
her
rightful
inheritance
the
mulatto
was
in
raptures
she
told
colonel
mordaunt
that
he
was
a
charming
man
and
infinitely
handsomer
than
berrendale
though
she
must
own
he
was
very
good
to
look
at
and
she
wished
with
all
her
soul
that
colonel
mordaunt
was
married
to
her
lady
for
then
she
believed
she
would
have
never
known
sorrow
but
been
as
happy
as
the
day
was
long
colonel
mordaunt
could
not
hear
this
without
a
secret
pang
i
followed
said
he
mentally
dictates
of
my
heart
when
i
saw
adeline
at
bath
i
might
now
perhaps
instead
of
being
a
forlorn
unattached
being
have
been
a
happy
husband
and
father
and
adeline
instead
of
having
been
the
mistress
of
one
man
the
disowned
wife
of
another
might
have
been
happy
and
beloved
and
as
respectable
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
as
she
is
in
those
of
her
grateful
mulatto
however
there
was
some
hope
left
for
him
adeline
he
thought
was
not
a
woman
likely
to
be
in
her
ideas
and
might
very
naturally
think
herself
at
liberty
to
accept
the
protection
of
a
lover
when
from
no
fault
of
hers
she
had
lost
that
of
her
husband
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
while
elevated
with
these
hopes
he
did
not
fail
to
be
very
constant
in
his
visits
to
adeline
and
that
at
length
more
led
by
passion
than
policy
he
abruptly
at
the
end
of
ten
days
informed
adeline
that
he
knew
her
situation
and
that
he
trusted
that
she
would
allow
him
to
hope
that
in
due
time
his
love
which
had
been
proof
against
time
absence
and
disdain
would
meet
with
reward
and
that
on
his
settling
a
handsome
income
on
her
and
her
child
for
their
joint
lives
she
would
allow
him
to
endeavour
to
make
her
as
happy
as
she
and
she
only
could
make
him
to
this
proposal
which
was
in
form
of
a
letter
colonel
mordaunt
did
not
receive
an
immediate
answer
nor
was
it
at
first
likely
that
he
should
ever
receive
an
answer
to
it
at
all
as
adeline
was
at
the
moment
of
its
arrival
confined
to
her
bed
according
to
her
expectations
with
the
disease
which
she
had
been
but
too
fearful
of
imbibing
while
the
mulatto
was
forced
to
give
up
to
others
the
care
of
the
sickening
editha
to
watch
over
the
delirious
and
unconscious
adeline
but
the
tawny
boy
generous
benefactress
gave
him
leave
to
remain
at
adeline
lodgings
in
order
to
calm
his
fears
for
editha
and
assist
in
amusing
and
keeping
her
quiet
and
if
attention
had
any
share
in
preserving
the
life
and
beauty
of
editha
it
was
to
the
affectionate
tawny
boy
that
she
owed
them
and
he
was
soon
rewarded
for
all
his
care
and
anxiety
by
seeing
his
little
charge
able
to
play
about
as
usual
colonel
mordaunt
and
the
mulatto
meanwhile
did
not
obtain
so
speedy
a
termination
to
their
anxieties
adeline
recovery
was
for
a
long
time
a
matter
of
doubt
and
her
weakness
so
great
after
the
crisis
of
the
disorder
was
past
that
none
ventured
to
pronounce
her
even
then
out
of
danger
but
at
length
she
was
in
a
great
measure
restored
to
health
and
able
to
determine
what
line
of
conduct
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
to
return
an
answer
to
colonel
mordaunt
proposals
was
certainly
her
first
business
but
as
she
felt
that
the
situation
in
which
he
had
once
known
her
made
his
offer
less
affronting
than
it
would
have
been
under
other
circumstances
she
resolved
to
speak
to
him
on
the
subject
with
gentleness
not
severity
especially
as
during
her
illness
to
amuse
the
anxiety
that
had
preyed
upon
him
he
had
taken
every
possible
step
to
procure
evidence
of
the
marriage
and
gave
into
savanna
hands
the
first
day
that
he
was
permitted
to
see
her
an
attested
certificate
of
it
chapter
xxi
the
first
question
which
adeline
asked
on
her
recovery
was
whether
any
letter
had
come
by
the
during
her
illness
and
savanna
gave
one
to
her
immediately
it
was
the
letter
so
ardently
desired
for
the
direction
was
in
her
mother
and
she
opened
it
full
of
eager
expectation
while
her
whole
existence
seemed
to
depend
on
the
nature
of
its
contents
what
then
must
have
been
her
agony
on
finding
that
the
contained
nothing
but
her
own
letter
returned
for
some
time
she
spoke
not
she
breathed
not
while
savanna
mixed
with
expressions
of
terror
at
sight
of
her
mistress
distress
poured
execrations
on
the
unnatural
parent
who
had
so
cruelly
occasioned
it
after
a
few
days
incessant
struggle
to
overcome
the
violence
of
her
sorrow
adeline
recovered
the
shock
in
appearance
at
least
yet
to
savanna
she
could
not
help
answering
laying
her
hand
on
her
heart
blow
is
here
savanna
and
the
wound
incurable
soon
after
she
thought
herself
well
enough
to
see
colonel
mordaunt
and
to
thank
him
for
the
recent
proof
of
his
attention
to
her
and
her
interest
but
no
obligation
however
great
could
shut
the
now
vigilant
eyes
of
adeline
to
the
impropriety
of
receiving
further
visits
from
him
or
to
the
guilt
of
welcoming
to
her
house
a
man
who
made
open
professions
to
her
of
illicit
love
she
however
thought
it
her
duty
to
see
him
once
more
in
order
to
try
to
reconcile
him
to
the
necessity
of
the
rule
of
conduct
which
she
was
going
to
lay
down
for
herself
nor
was
she
without
hope
that
the
yet
recent
traces
of
the
disease
to
which
she
had
so
nearly
fallen
a
victim
would
make
her
appearance
so
unpleasing
to
the
eyes
of
her
lover
that
he
would
be
very
willing
to
absent
himself
from
the
house
for
some
time
at
least
and
probably
give
up
all
thoughts
of
her
but
she
did
neither
herself
nor
colonel
mordaunt
she
was
formed
to
inspire
a
real
and
lasting
passion
a
passion
that
no
external
change
could
destroy
since
it
was
founded
on
the
unchanging
qualities
of
the
heart
and
mind
and
colonel
mordaunt
felt
for
her
such
an
attachment
in
all
its
force
he
had
always
admired
the
attractive
person
and
winning
graces
of
adeline
and
felt
for
her
what
he
denominated
love
but
that
rational
though
enthusiastic
preference
which
is
deserving
of
the
name
of
true
love
he
never
felt
till
he
had
had
an
opportunity
to
appreciate
justly
the
real
character
of
adeline
still
there
were
times
when
he
felt
almost
gratified
to
reflect
that
she
could
not
legally
be
his
for
whatever
might
have
been
the
cause
and
excuse
of
her
errors
she
had
erred
and
the
delicacy
of
his
mind
revolted
at
the
idea
of
marrying
the
mistress
of
another
but
when
he
saw
and
heard
adeline
this
repugnance
vanished
and
he
knew
that
could
he
at
those
moments
lead
her
to
the
altar
he
should
not
have
hesitated
to
bind
himself
to
her
for
ever
by
the
sacred
ties
which
the
early
errors
of
her
judgment
had
made
her
even
in
his
opinion
almost
unworthy
to
form
at
length
a
day
was
fixed
for
his
interview
with
adeline
and
with
a
beating
heart
he
entered
the
apartment
nor
was
his
emotion
diminished
when
he
beheld
not
only
the
usual
vestiges
of
her
complaint
but
symptoms
of
debility
and
a
meagreness
of
aspect
which
made
him
fear
that
though
one
malady
was
conquered
another
even
more
dangerous
remained
the
idea
overcame
him
and
he
was
forced
to
turn
to
the
window
to
hide
his
emotion
and
his
manner
was
so
indicative
of
ardent
yet
respectful
attachment
that
adeline
began
to
feel
in
spite
of
herself
that
her
projected
task
was
difficult
of
execution
for
some
minutes
neither
of
them
spoke
mordaunt
held
the
hand
which
she
gave
him
to
his
heart
kissed
it
as
she
withdrew
it
and
again
turned
away
his
head
to
conceal
a
starting
tear
while
adeline
was
not
sorry
to
have
a
few
moments
in
which
to
recover
herself
before
she
addressed
him
on
the
subject
at
that
time
nearest
to
the
heart
of
both
at
length
she
summoned
resolution
enough
to
say
as
i
have
been
mortified
and
degraded
colonel
mordaunt
by
the
letter
which
i
have
received
from
you
still
i
rejoice
that
i
did
receive
it
in
the
first
place
i
rejoice
because
i
look
on
all
the
sufferings
and
mortifications
which
i
meet
with
as
merciful
chastisements
as
expiations
inflicted
on
me
in
mercy
by
the
being
whom
i
adore
for
the
sins
of
which
i
have
been
guilty
and
in
the
second
place
because
it
gives
me
an
opportunity
of
proving
incontrovertibly
my
full
conviction
of
the
fallacy
of
my
past
opinions
and
that
i
became
a
wife
after
my
idle
declamations
against
marriage
from
change
of
principle
on
assurance
of
error
and
not
from
interest
or
necessity
here
she
paused
overcome
with
the
effort
which
she
had
made
and
colonel
mordaunt
would
have
interrupted
her
but
earnestly
conjuring
him
to
give
her
a
patient
hearing
she
proceeded
thus
the
change
in
my
practice
been
the
result
of
any
thing
but
rational
conviction
i
should
now
unfortunate
as
i
have
been
in
the
choice
of
a
husband
regret
that
ever
i
formed
so
foolish
a
tie
and
perhaps
be
induced
to
enter
into
a
less
sacred
connexion
from
an
idea
that
that
state
which
forced
me
to
drag
out
existence
in
hopeless
misery
was
contrary
to
reason
justice
and
the
benefit
of
society
and
that
the
sooner
its
ties
were
dissolved
the
better
it
would
be
for
individual
happiness
and
for
the
world
at
large
do
you
not
think
so
cried
colonel
mordaunt
can
not
your
own
individual
experience
convince
you
of
it
from
it
replied
adeline
i
bless
god
that
it
does
not
for
thence
and
thence
only
do
i
begin
to
be
reconciled
to
myself
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
individual
suffering
in
the
marriage
state
from
a
contrariety
of
temper
and
other
causes
but
i
believe
that
the
mass
of
happiness
and
virtue
is
certainly
increased
by
it
individual
suffering
therefore
is
no
argument
for
the
abolition
of
marriage
than
the
accidental
bursting
of
a
musket
would
be
for
the
total
abolition
of
surely
dear
mrs
berrendale
you
would
wish
divorce
to
be
made
easier
than
it
is
no
means
interrupted
adeline
understanding
what
he
was
going
to
say
bear
and
forbear
i
believe
to
be
the
grand
secret
of
happiness
and
that
it
ought
to
be
the
great
study
of
life
therefore
whatever
would
enable
married
persons
to
separate
on
the
slightest
quarrel
or
disgust
would
make
it
so
much
the
less
necessary
for
us
to
learn
this
important
lesson
a
lesson
so
needful
in
order
to
perfect
the
human
character
that
i
believe
the
difficulty
of
divorce
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
blessings
of
society
can
have
so
completely
changed
your
opinions
on
this
subject
replied
colonel
mordaunt
my
own
experience
returned
adeline
the
painful
situations
in
which
i
have
been
placed
i
might
attribute
not
to
the
fallacy
of
the
system
on
which
i
have
acted
but
to
those
existing
prejudices
in
society
which
i
wish
to
see
destroyed
to
what
else
is
the
change
in
your
sentiments
to
be
attributed
a
more
serious
unimpassioned
and
unprejudiced
view
of
the
subject
than
i
had
before
taken
at
present
i
am
not
equal
to
expatiate
on
matters
so
important
however
some
time
or
other
perhaps
i
may
make
known
to
you
my
sentiments
on
them
in
a
more
ample
manner
but
i
have
i
trust
said
enough
to
lead
you
to
conclude
that
though
mr
conduct
to
me
has
been
atrocious
and
that
you
are
in
many
respects
entitled
to
my
gratitude
and
thanks
you
and
i
must
henceforward
be
strangers
to
each
other
colonel
mordaunt
little
expecting
such
a
total
overthrow
to
his
hopes
was
on
receiving
it
choked
with
contending
emotions
and
his
broken
sentences
and
pale
cheek
were
sufficiently
expressive
of
the
distress
which
he
endured
but
i
shall
not
enter
into
a
detail
of
all
he
urged
in
favour
of
his
passion
nor
the
calm
dignified
manner
in
which
adeline
replied
suffice
that
at
last
from
a
sort
of
intuitive
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
as
it
were
which
persons
of
quick
talent
and
sensibilities
possess
however
defective
their
experience
adeline
resolved
to
try
to
soothe
the
which
she
had
wounded
knowing
that
is
scarcely
to
be
distinguished
in
its
effects
from
love
itself
and
that
the
agony
of
disappointed
passion
is
always
greater
when
it
is
inflicted
by
the
coldness
or
falsehood
of
the
beloved
object
than
when
it
proceeds
from
parental
prohibition
or
the
cruel
separation
enjoined
by
conscious
poverty
she
therefore
told
colonel
mordaunt
that
he
was
once
very
near
being
the
first
choice
of
her
heart
when
she
first
saw
him
she
said
his
person
and
manners
and
attentions
had
so
strongly
prepossessed
her
in
his
favour
that
he
himself
by
ceasing
to
see
and
converse
with
her
could
alone
have
saved
her
from
the
pain
of
a
hopeless
attachment
pity
spare
me
cried
mordaunt
contemplation
of
the
happiness
i
might
have
enjoyed
you
know
you
were
not
a
as
it
is
called
and
forgive
me
if
i
say
that
men
who
can
on
system
suppress
the
best
feelings
of
their
nature
and
prefer
a
course
of
libertine
indulgence
to
a
virtuous
connexion
at
that
time
of
life
when
they
might
become
happy
husbands
and
fathers
with
the
reasonable
expectation
of
living
to
see
their
children
grown
up
to
manhood
and
superintending
their
education
themselves
such
men
colonel
mordaunt
deserve
in
the
decline
of
life
to
feel
that
regret
and
that
which
you
this
moment
anticipate
too
true
replied
the
colonel
for
mercy
sake
torture
me
no
more
would
not
probe
where
i
did
not
intend
to
make
a
cure
replied
adeline
cure
what
mean
you
mean
to
induce
you
ere
it
be
yet
too
late
to
endeavour
to
form
a
virtuous
attachment
and
to
unite
yourself
for
life
with
some
amiable
young
woman
who
will
make
you
as
happy
as
i
would
have
endeavoured
to
make
you
had
it
been
my
fortunate
lot
to
be
yours
for
believe
me
colonel
mordaunt
and
her
voice
faltered
as
she
said
it
whom
i
still
continue
to
love
with
unabated
tenderness
though
years
have
elapsed
since
he
was
taken
from
me
had
he
bequeathed
me
to
you
on
his
the
reluctance
with
which
i
went
to
the
altar
would
have
been
more
easily
overcome
saying
this
she
suddenly
left
the
room
leaving
colonel
mordaunt
surprised
gratified
and
his
mind
struggling
between
hopes
and
fears
for
adeline
was
not
conscious
that
she
imparted
hope
as
well
as
consolation
by
the
method
which
she
pursued
and
though
she
sent
savanna
to
tell
the
colonel
she
could
see
him
no
more
that
evening
he
departed
in
firm
expectation
that
adeline
would
not
have
resolution
to
forbid
him
to
see
her
again
in
this
however
he
was
mistaken
adeline
had
learnt
the
best
of
all
lessons
distrust
of
her
own
strength
and
she
resolved
to
put
it
out
of
her
power
to
receive
visits
which
a
regard
to
propriety
forbade
and
which
might
injure
her
reputation
if
not
her
peace
of
mind
therefore
as
soon
as
colonel
mordaunt
was
gone
she
summoned
savanna
and
desired
her
to
proceed
to
business
cried
the
delighted
mulatto
we
going
to
prosecu
massa
replied
adeline
are
going
into
the
country
i
am
come
to
a
determination
to
take
no
legal
steps
in
this
affair
but
leave
mr
berrendale
to
the
reproaches
of
his
own
conscience
fiddle
end
replied
savanna
have
no
conscience
or
he
no
leave
you
better
get
him
hang
if
you
can
den
you
marry
de
colonel
had
better
hang
the
father
of
my
child
had
i
savanna
no
no
no
no
me
forget
dat
i
do
not
nor
can
i
even
bear
to
disgrace
the
father
of
editha
therefore
trusting
that
i
can
dispose
of
her
and
secure
her
interest
better
than
by
forcing
her
father
to
do
her
justice
and
bastardize
the
poor
innocent
whom
his
wife
will
soon
bring
into
the
world
i
am
going
to
bury
myself
in
retirement
and
live
the
short
remainder
of
my
days
unknowing
and
unknown
chapter
xxii
savanna
was
going
to
remonstrate
but
the
words
remainder
of
my
days
distressed
her
so
much
that
tears
choked
her
words
and
she
obeyed
in
silence
her
mistress
orders
to
pack
up
except
when
she
indulged
in
a
few
exclamations
against
her
lady
cruelty
in
going
away
without
taking
leave
of
colonel
mordaunt
who
sweet
gentleman
would
break
his
heart
at
her
departure
especially
as
he
was
not
to
know
whither
she
was
going
a
postchaise
was
at
the
door
the
next
morning
at
six
and
as
adeline
had
not
much
luggage
having
left
the
chief
part
of
her
furniture
to
be
divided
between
the
mistresses
of
her
two
lodgings
in
return
for
their
kind
attention
to
her
and
her
child
she
took
an
affectionate
leave
of
her
landlady
and
desired
the
to
drive
a
mile
on
the
road
before
him
and
when
he
had
done
so
she
ordered
him
to
go
on
to
barnet
while
the
disappointed
mulatto
thanked
god
that
the
tawny
boy
was
gone
to
scotland
with
his
protectress
as
it
prevented
her
having
the
mortification
of
leaving
him
behind
her
as
well
as
the
had
i
such
a
lover
cried
she
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
never
leave
him
nor
he
me
and
for
the
first
time
she
thought
her
for
some
miles
they
proceeded
in
silence
for
adeline
was
too
much
engrossed
to
speak
and
the
little
editha
being
fast
asleep
in
the
mulatto
arms
did
not
draw
her
mother
out
of
the
reverie
into
which
she
had
fallen
where
now
said
the
mulatto
when
the
chaise
stopped
the
next
stage
on
the
high
north
road
and
on
they
went
again
nor
did
they
stop
except
for
refreshments
till
they
had
travelled
thirty
miles
when
adeline
worn
out
with
fatigue
staid
all
night
at
the
inn
where
the
chaise
stopped
and
the
next
morning
they
resumed
their
journey
but
not
their
silence
the
mulatto
could
no
longer
restrain
her
curiosity
and
she
begged
to
know
whither
they
were
going
and
why
they
were
to
be
buried
in
the
country
adeline
sighing
deeply
answered
that
they
were
going
to
live
in
cumberland
and
then
sunk
into
silence
again
as
she
could
not
give
the
mulatto
her
true
reasons
for
the
plan
that
she
was
pursuing
without
wounding
her
affectionate
heart
in
a
manner
wholly
incurable
the
truth
was
that
adeline
supposed
herself
to
be
declining
she
thought
that
she
experienced
those
dreadful
languors
those
sensations
of
internal
weakness
which
however
veiled
to
the
eye
of
the
observer
speak
in
forcible
language
to
the
heart
of
the
conscious
sufferer
indeed
adeline
had
long
struggled
but
in
vain
against
feelings
of
a
most
overwhelming
nature
amongst
which
remorse
and
horror
for
having
led
by
her
example
and
precepts
an
innocent
girl
into
a
life
of
infamy
were
the
most
painfully
predominant
for
believing
mary
warner
assertion
when
she
saw
her
at
mr
langley
chambers
she
looked
upon
that
unhappy
girl
guilt
as
the
consequence
of
her
own
and
mourned
incessantly
mourned
over
the
fatal
errors
of
her
early
judgment
which
had
made
her
though
an
idolater
of
virtue
a
practical
assistant
to
the
cause
of
vice
when
adeline
imagined
the
term
of
her
existence
to
be
drawing
nigh
her
mother
her
obdurate
but
still
dear
mother
regained
her
wonted
ascendancy
over
her
affections
and
to
her
the
approach
of
death
seemed
fraught
with
satisfaction
for
that
parent
so
long
so
repeatedly
deaf
to
her
prayers
and
to
the
detail
of
those
sufferings
which
she
had
made
one
of
the
conditions
of
her
forgiveness
had
promised
to
see
and
to
forgive
her
on
her
and
her
heart
yearned
fondly
yearned
for
the
moment
when
she
should
be
pressed
to
the
bosom
of
a
relenting
parent
to
cumberland
therefore
she
was
resolved
to
hasten
and
into
the
very
neighbourhood
of
mrs
mowbray
while
as
the
chaise
wheeled
them
along
to
the
place
of
their
destination
even
the
prattle
of
her
child
could
not
always
withdraw
her
from
the
abstraction
into
which
she
was
plunged
as
the
scenes
of
her
early
years
thronged
upon
her
memory
and
with
them
the
recollection
of
those
proofs
of
a
mother
fondness
for
a
renewal
of
which
even
in
the
society
of
glenmurray
she
had
constantly
and
despondingly
sighed
as
they
approached
penrith
her
emotion
redoubled
and
she
involuntarily
exclaimed
but
still
dear
mother
you
little
think
your
child
is
so
near
save
me
cried
savanna
we
to
go
and
be
near
dat
woman
replied
adeline
she
not
say
she
would
forgive
me
on
my
you
not
there
yet
dear
missess
sobbed
savanna
not
there
of
long
years
returned
adeline
should
die
contented
to
purchase
my
mother
blessing
and
forgiveness
savanna
speechless
with
contending
emotions
could
not
express
by
words
the
feeling
of
mixed
sorrow
and
indignation
which
overwhelmed
her
but
she
replied
by
putting
editha
in
adeline
arms
then
articulating
with
effort
there
she
sobbed
aloud
understand
you
said
adeline
kissing
away
the
tears
gathering
in
editha
eyes
at
sight
of
savanna
distress
perhaps
i
think
my
death
would
be
of
more
service
to
my
child
than
my
life
to
me
too
i
suppose
replied
savanna
reproachfully
me
go
to
scotland
for
no
one
love
me
but
the
tawny
boy
will
stay
and
close
my
eyes
first
i
hope
observed
adeline
mournfully
in
a
moment
savanna
resentment
vanished
will
live
and
die
vid
you
she
replied
her
tears
redoubling
while
adeline
again
sunk
into
thoughtful
silence
as
soon
as
they
reached
penrith
adeline
inquired
for
lodgings
out
of
the
town
on
that
side
nearest
to
her
mother
abode
and
was
so
fortunate
as
she
esteemed
herself
to
procure
two
apartments
at
a
small
house
within
two
miles
of
mrs
mowbray
i
breathe
once
more
the
same
air
with
my
mother
exclaimed
adeline
as
she
took
possession
of
her
lodging
methinks
i
breathe
freer
already
more
choked
replied
the
mulatto
and
turned
sullenly
away
i
i
feel
so
much
better
that
i
will
i
will
take
a
walk
said
adeline
hesitatingly
where
asked
savanna
eagerly
i
shall
only
walk
to
bed
replied
adeline
smiling
and
with
unusual
cheerfulness
she
retired
to
rest
the
next
morning
she
arose
early
and
being
informed
that
a
stile
near
a
peasant
cottage
commanded
a
view
of
mrs
mowbray
house
she
hired
a
man
and
cart
to
convey
her
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
with
editha
by
her
side
she
set
out
to
indulge
her
feelings
by
gazing
on
the
house
which
contained
her
mother
when
they
alighted
editha
gaily
endeavoured
to
climb
the
hill
and
urged
her
mother
to
follow
her
but
adeline
rendered
weak
by
illness
and
breathless
by
emotion
felt
the
ascent
so
difficult
that
no
motive
less
powerful
than
the
one
which
actuated
her
could
have
enabled
her
to
reach
the
summit
at
length
however
she
did
reach
it
and
the
lawn
before
mrs
white
house
her
and
the
running
stream
at
the
bottom
of
it
burst
in
all
their
beauty
on
her
this
is
my
dwelling
exclaimed
adeline
there
was
i
born
and
near
here
shall
i
die
she
would
have
added
but
her
voice
failed
her
what
a
pretty
house
and
garden
cried
editha
in
the
unformed
accents
of
childhood
i
should
like
to
live
there
this
artless
remark
awakened
a
thousand
mixed
and
overpowering
feelings
in
the
bosom
of
adeline
and
after
a
pause
of
strong
emotion
she
exclaimed
catching
the
little
prattler
to
her
heart
live
there
my
child
yes
yes
you
live
there
when
resumed
editha
i
am
in
my
grave
answered
adeline
when
shall
you
be
there
replied
the
unconscious
child
fondly
caressing
her
mamma
pray
be
there
soon
adeline
turned
away
unable
to
answer
her
look
mamma
resumed
editha
are
oh
do
let
us
go
there
now
why
ca
we
to
god
we
could
replied
adeline
as
in
one
of
the
ladies
she
recognized
mrs
mowbray
and
stood
gazing
on
her
till
her
eyes
ached
again
but
what
she
felt
on
seeing
her
she
will
herself
describe
in
the
succeeding
pages
and
i
shall
only
add
that
as
soon
as
mrs
mowbray
returned
into
the
house
adeline
wrapped
in
a
long
and
mournful
reverie
returned
full
of
a
new
plan
to
her
lodgings
there
is
no
love
so
disinterested
as
parental
love
and
adeline
had
all
the
keen
sensibilities
of
a
parent
to
make
therefore
doubly
sure
that
mrs
mowbray
should
receive
and
should
love
her
orphan
when
she
was
no
more
she
resolved
to
give
up
the
gratification
to
which
she
had
looked
forward
the
hope
before
she
died
of
obtaining
her
forgiveness
that
she
might
not
weaken
by
directing
any
part
of
them
to
herself
those
feelings
of
remorse
fruitless
tenderness
and
useless
regret
in
her
mother
bosom
which
she
wished
should
be
concentrated
on
her
child
said
adeline
to
herself
am
sure
that
she
will
not
refuse
to
receive
my
orphan
to
her
love
and
protection
when
i
am
no
more
and
am
become
alike
insensible
of
reproaches
and
of
blessings
and
i
think
that
she
will
love
my
child
the
more
tenderly
because
to
me
she
will
be
unable
to
express
the
compunction
which
sooner
or
later
she
will
feel
from
the
recollection
of
her
conduct
towards
me
therefore
i
will
make
no
demands
on
her
love
for
myself
but
in
a
letter
to
be
given
her
after
my
decease
bequeath
my
orphan
to
her
care
and
with
this
determination
she
returned
from
her
ride
you
see
her
said
savanna
running
out
to
meet
her
but
not
spoken
to
her
nor
shall
i
see
her
again
i
suppose
she
see
you
and
not
speak
no
she
did
not
see
me
nor
shall
i
urge
her
to
see
me
my
plans
are
altered
replied
adeline
we
go
back
to
town
and
colonel
mordaunt
resumed
adeline
sighing
deeply
and
preparing
to
write
to
mrs
mowbray
but
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
for
a
short
time
go
back
to
berrendale
and
relate
that
while
adeline
and
editha
were
confined
with
the
mr
drury
received
a
summons
from
his
employer
in
jamaica
to
go
over
thither
to
be
intrusted
with
some
particular
business
in
consequence
of
this
he
resolved
to
call
again
on
adeline
and
inquire
whether
she
still
persisted
in
styling
herself
mrs
berrendale
as
he
concluded
that
berrendale
would
be
very
glad
of
all
the
information
relative
to
her
and
her
child
which
he
could
possibly
procure
whether
his
curiosity
on
the
subject
proceeded
from
fear
or
love
it
so
happened
that
as
soon
as
editha
as
well
as
her
mother
was
in
the
height
of
the
disorder
mr
drury
called
and
finding
that
they
were
both
very
bad
he
thought
that
his
friend
berrendale
was
likely
to
get
rid
of
both
his
encumbrances
at
once
and
being
eager
to
communicate
good
news
to
a
man
whose
influence
in
the
island
might
be
a
benefit
to
him
he
every
day
called
to
inquire
concerning
their
health
the
second
floor
in
the
house
where
adeline
lodged
was
then
occupied
by
a
young
woman
in
indigent
circumstances
who
as
well
as
her
child
had
sickened
with
the
distemper
the
very
day
that
editha
was
inoculated
and
when
drury
just
as
he
was
setting
off
for
portsmouth
ran
to
gain
the
latest
intelligence
of
the
invalids
a
charwoman
who
attended
to
the
door
not
being
acquainted
with
the
name
of
the
poor
young
woman
and
her
little
girl
concluding
that
mr
drury
by
mrs
berrendale
and
miss
who
were
ill
with
the
meant
them
replied
to
his
inquiries
poor
things
it
is
all
over
with
them
they
died
last
night
on
which
not
staying
for
any
further
intelligence
drury
set
off
for
portsmouth
and
arrived
at
jamaica
just
as
berrendale
was
going
to
remit
to
adeline
a
draft
for
a
hundred
pounds
for
adeline
and
the
injury
which
he
had
done
her
had
been
for
some
days
constantly
present
to
his
thoughts
he
had
been
ill
and
as
indigestion
the
cause
of
his
complaints
is
apt
to
occasion
disturbed
dreams
he
had
in
his
dreams
been
haunted
by
the
image
of
glenmurray
who
with
a
threatening
aspect
had
reproached
him
with
cruelty
and
base
ingratitude
to
him
in
deserting
in
such
a
manner
the
wife
whom
he
had
bequeathed
to
him
the
constant
recurrence
of
these
dreams
had
depressed
his
spirits
and
excited
his
remorse
so
much
that
he
could
calm
his
feelings
in
no
other
way
than
by
writing
a
kind
letter
to
adeline
and
enclosing
her
a
draft
on
his
banker
this
letter
was
on
the
point
of
being
sent
when
drury
arrived
and
with
very
little
ceremony
informed
him
that
adeline
was
dead
exclaimed
berrendale
falling
almost
sensless
on
his
couch
oh
for
god
sake
tell
me
of
what
she
died
surely
surely
she
here
his
voice
failed
him
drury
coolly
replied
that
she
and
her
child
both
died
of
the
my
dear
fellow
when
say
that
they
died
nine
months
that
was
previous
to
his
marriage
you
make
me
your
friend
for
life
drury
so
would
have
said
and
with
all
the
coolness
possible
he
replied
be
my
friend
for
life
they
died
rather
better
than
nine
months
ago
berrendale
being
then
convinced
that
bigamy
was
not
likely
to
be
proved
against
him
soon
forgot
in
the
joy
which
this
thought
occasioned
him
remorse
for
his
conduct
to
adeline
and
regret
for
her
early
fate
besides
he
concluded
that
he
saved
by
the
means
for
he
knew
not
that
the
delicate
mind
of
adeline
would
have
scorned
to
owe
pecuniary
obligations
to
the
husband
who
had
basely
and
unwarrantably
deserted
her
but
he
was
soon
undeceived
on
this
subject
by
a
letter
which
colonel
mordaunt
wrote
in
confidence
to
a
friend
in
jamaica
begging
him
to
inquire
concerning
mr
berrendale
second
marriage
and
to
inform
him
privately
that
his
injured
wife
had
zealous
and
powerful
friends
in
england
who
were
continually
urging
her
to
prosecute
him
for
bigamy
this
intelligence
had
a
fatal
effect
on
the
health
of
berrendale
for
though
the
violent
temper
and
overbearing
disposition
of
his
second
wife
had
often
made
him
regret
the
gentle
and
compliant
adeline
and
a
separation
from
her
consequently
would
be
a
blessing
still
he
feared
to
encounter
the
disgrace
of
a
prosecution
and
still
more
the
anger
of
his
west
indian
wife
who
it
was
not
improbable
might
even
attack
his
life
in
the
first
moment
of
ungoverned
passion
and
to
these
fears
he
soon
fell
a
sacrifice
for
a
frame
debilitated
by
intemperance
could
not
support
the
assaults
made
on
it
by
the
continued
apprehensions
which
colonel
mordaunt
friend
had
excited
in
him
and
he
died
in
that
gentleman
presence
whom
in
his
last
moments
he
had
summoned
to
his
apartment
to
witness
a
will
by
which
he
owned
adeline
mowbray
to
be
his
lawful
wife
and
left
editha
his
acknowledged
and
only
heir
a
very
considerable
fortune
but
this
circumstance
an
account
of
which
with
the
will
was
transmitted
to
colonel
mordaunt
did
not
take
place
till
long
after
adeline
took
up
her
abode
in
cumberland
chapter
xxiii
but
to
return
to
colonel
mordaunt
though
adeline
had
said
that
he
must
discontinue
his
visits
he
resolved
to
disobey
her
and
the
next
morning
as
soon
as
he
thought
she
had
breakfasted
he
repaired
to
her
lodgings
where
he
heard
with
mixed
sorrow
and
indignation
that
she
had
set
off
in
a
at
six
and
was
gone
no
one
knew
whither
surely
she
has
left
some
note
or
message
for
me
exclaimed
colonel
mordaunt
the
one
nor
the
other
was
the
answer
and
he
returned
home
in
no
very
enviable
state
of
mind
various
indeed
and
contradictory
were
his
feelings
yet
still
affection
was
uppermost
and
he
could
not
but
respect
in
adeline
the
conduct
which
drove
him
to
despair
nor
was
backward
to
suggest
to
him
that
had
not
adeline
felt
his
presence
and
attentions
to
be
dangerous
she
would
not
so
suddenly
have
withdrawn
from
them
and
this
idea
was
the
only
one
on
which
he
could
at
all
bear
to
dwell
for
when
he
reflected
that
day
after
day
might
pass
without
his
either
seeing
or
hearing
from
her
existence
seemed
to
become
suddenly
a
burthen
and
he
wandered
from
place
to
place
with
joyless
and
unceasing
restlessness
at
one
time
he
resolved
to
pursue
her
but
the
next
piqued
at
not
having
received
from
her
even
a
note
of
farewell
he
determined
to
endeavour
to
forget
her
and
this
was
certainly
the
wiser
plan
of
the
two
but
the
succeeding
moment
he
determined
to
let
a
week
pass
in
hopes
of
receiving
a
letter
from
her
and
in
case
he
did
not
to
set
off
in
search
of
her
being
assured
of
succeeding
in
his
search
of
her
because
the
singularity
of
savanna
appearance
and
the
traces
of
the
visible
in
the
face
of
adeline
made
them
liable
to
be
observed
and
easy
for
him
to
describe
but
before
the
week
elapsed
from
agitation
of
mind
and
from
having
exposed
himself
unnecessarily
to
cold
by
lying
on
damp
grass
at
midnight
after
having
heated
himself
by
immoderate
walking
colonel
mordaunt
became
ill
of
a
fever
and
when
after
a
confinement
of
several
weeks
he
was
restored
to
health
he
despaired
of
being
able
to
learn
tidings
of
the
fugitives
and
disappointed
and
dejected
he
sought
in
the
gayest
scenes
of
the
metropolis
and
its
environs
to
drown
the
remembrances
from
which
in
solitude
he
had
vainly
endeavoured
to
fly
at
this
time
a
faded
but
attractive
woman
of
quality
with
whom
he
had
formerly
been
intimate
returned
from
abroad
and
meeting
colonel
mordaunt
at
the
house
of
a
mutual
friend
endeavoured
to
revive
in
him
his
former
attachment
but
it
was
a
difficult
task
for
a
woman
who
had
never
been
able
to
touch
the
heart
to
excite
an
attachment
in
a
man
already
sentimentally
devoted
to
another
her
advances
however
flattered
colonel
mordaunt
and
her
society
amused
him
till
at
length
their
intimacy
was
renewed
on
its
former
footing
but
soon
tired
of
his
mistress
and
displeased
with
himself
he
took
an
abrupt
leave
of
her
and
throwing
himself
into
his
retired
to
the
seat
of
a
relation
in
herefordshire
near
this
gentleman
house
lived
mr
maynard
and
his
two
sisters
who
had
taken
up
their
abode
there
immediately
on
their
return
from
portugal
major
douglas
his
wife
and
emma
douglas
were
then
on
a
visit
to
them
mordaunt
had
known
major
douglas
in
early
life
and
as
soon
as
he
found
that
he
was
in
the
neighbourhood
he
rode
over
to
renew
his
acquaintance
with
him
and
received
so
cordial
a
welcome
not
only
from
the
major
but
the
master
of
the
house
and
his
sisters
that
he
was
strongly
induced
to
repeat
his
visits
and
not
a
day
passed
in
which
he
was
not
during
some
part
of
it
a
guest
at
mr
maynard
mrs
wallington
and
miss
maynard
indeed
received
him
with
such
pointed
marks
of
distinction
and
preference
as
to
make
it
visible
to
every
observer
that
it
was
not
as
a
friend
only
they
were
desirous
of
considering
colonel
mordaunt
while
by
spiteful
looks
and
acrimonious
remarks
directed
to
each
other
the
sisters
expressed
the
jealousy
which
rankled
in
their
hearts
whenever
he
seemed
by
design
or
inadvertency
to
make
one
of
them
the
particular
object
of
his
attention
of
emma
douglas
chance
for
his
favour
they
were
not
at
all
fearful
they
thought
her
too
plain
and
too
unattractive
to
be
capable
of
rivalling
them
especially
in
the
favour
of
an
officer
a
man
of
fashion
and
therefore
they
beheld
without
emotion
the
attention
which
colonel
mordaunt
paid
to
her
whenever
she
spoke
and
the
deference
which
he
evidently
felt
for
her
opinion
as
her
remarks
on
whatever
subject
she
conversed
were
formed
always
to
interest
and
often
to
instruct
one
evening
while
major
douglas
was
amusing
himself
in
looking
over
some
magazines
which
had
lately
been
bound
up
together
and
had
not
yet
been
deposited
in
mr
maynard
library
he
suddenly
started
laid
down
the
book
and
turning
to
the
window
with
an
exclamation
of
fellow
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
as
if
meaning
to
disperse
an
involuntary
tear
makes
you
exclaim
poor
fellow
asked
his
lovely
wife
you
met
with
an
affecting
story
in
those
magazines
louisa
replied
he
i
met
in
the
obituary
with
a
confirmation
of
the
death
of
an
old
friend
which
i
suspected
must
have
happened
by
this
time
though
i
never
knew
it
before
i
see
by
this
magazine
that
poor
glenmurray
died
a
very
few
months
after
we
saw
him
at
perpignan
fellow
exclaimed
mrs
douglas
wish
i
knew
what
is
become
of
his
interesting
companion
miss
mowbray
said
emma
douglas
wish
i
did
too
secretly
sighed
colonel
mordaunt
but
his
heart
palpitated
so
violently
at
this
unexpected
mention
of
the
woman
for
whom
he
still
pined
in
secret
that
he
had
not
resolution
to
say
that
he
knew
her
of
her
cried
miss
maynard
sneeringly
need
not
wonder
i
think
what
her
fate
is
no
doubt
mr
glenmurray
has
not
lost
her
companionable
qualities
and
is
a
companion
still
observed
mrs
wallington
rather
i
dare
say
that
angel
of
purity
is
gone
upon
the
town
it
was
the
dark
hour
else
colonel
mordaunt
agitation
on
hearing
these
gross
and
unjust
remarks
must
have
betrayed
his
secret
to
every
eye
while
indignation
now
impeded
his
utterance
as
much
as
confusion
had
done
before
surely
cried
the
kind
and
candid
emma
douglas
must
grossly
have
mistaken
miss
mowbray
character
if
she
was
capable
of
the
conduct
which
you
attribute
to
her
dear
creature
replied
mrs
wallington
should
you
know
any
thing
of
her
character
when
it
was
gone
long
before
you
knew
her
indeed
you
remind
me
of
my
brother
mr
davenport
continued
she
to
a
gentleman
present
you
ever
hear
the
story
of
my
brother
and
an
angel
of
purity
whom
he
met
with
abroad
never
quiet
said
maynard
will
not
be
laughed
at
however
mrs
wallington
and
miss
maynard
who
had
not
yet
forgiven
the
deep
impression
which
adeline
graces
had
made
on
their
brother
insisted
on
telling
the
story
to
which
colonel
mordaunt
listened
with
eager
and
anxious
curiosity
it
received
all
the
embellishments
which
female
malice
could
give
it
and
if
it
amused
any
one
certainly
that
person
was
neither
mordaunt
nor
emma
douglas
nor
her
gentle
sister
how
fortunate
it
was
added
miss
maynard
we
were
not
with
my
brother
as
we
should
unavoidably
have
walked
and
talked
with
this
angel
mordaunt
longed
to
say
think
the
good
fortune
was
all
on
miss
mowbray
side
but
adeline
and
her
cause
were
in
good
hands
emma
douglas
stood
forth
as
her
feel
very
differently
on
that
subject
she
replied
shall
ever
regret
not
that
i
saw
and
conversed
with
miss
mowbray
but
that
i
did
not
see
and
converse
with
her
again
and
again
at
this
moment
emma
was
standing
by
colonel
mordaunt
who
involuntarily
caught
her
hand
and
pressed
it
eagerly
but
tried
to
disguise
his
motives
by
suddenly
seating
her
in
a
chair
behind
her
saying
had
better
sit
down
i
am
sure
you
must
be
tired
with
standing
so
long
really
emma
cried
major
douglas
go
too
far
there
though
to
be
sure
if
by
seeing
and
conversing
with
miss
mowbray
you
could
have
convinced
her
of
her
errors
i
should
not
have
objected
to
your
seeing
her
once
more
or
so
said
mrs
douglas
timidly
ought
my
love
to
have
repeated
our
visits
till
we
had
made
a
convert
of
her
of
her
exclaimed
mr
maynard
sisters
convert
of
a
kept
mistress
bursting
into
a
violent
laugh
which
had
a
most
painful
effect
on
the
irritable
nerves
of
colonel
mordaunt
whose
tongue
parched
with
emotion
cleaved
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
whenever
he
attempted
to
speak
to
what
other
circumstance
yet
untold
do
you
allude
said
mr
davenport
we
too
had
a
rencontre
with
the
philosopher
and
his
charming
friend
said
major
douglas
but
emma
do
you
tell
the
poor
fellow
well
but
we
parted
good
friends
added
the
caledonian
dispersing
a
tear
while
emma
in
simple
but
impressive
language
related
all
that
passed
at
perpignan
between
themselves
adeline
and
glenmurray
and
concluded
with
saying
that
the
almost
idolatrous
respect
with
which
glenmurray
spoke
and
apparently
thought
of
adeline
and
from
the
account
of
her
conduct
and
its
motives
which
he
so
fully
detailed
she
was
convinced
that
so
far
from
being
influenced
by
depravity
in
connecting
herself
with
glenmurray
adeline
was
the
victim
of
a
romantic
absurd
and
false
conception
of
virtue
and
she
should
have
thought
it
her
duty
to
have
endeavoured
assisted
by
her
sister
to
have
prevailed
on
her
to
renounce
her
opinions
and
by
becoming
the
wife
of
glenmurray
to
restore
to
the
society
of
her
own
sex
a
woman
formed
to
be
its
ornament
and
its
example
thing
she
added
in
a
faltering
voice
that
i
knew
her
fate
can
guess
it
i
tell
you
said
mrs
wallington
had
better
drop
the
subject
madam
replied
emma
douglas
indignantly
it
is
one
that
we
shall
never
agree
upon
if
i
supposed
miss
mowbray
happy
i
should
feel
for
her
and
feel
interest
sufficient
in
her
fate
to
make
me
combat
your
prejudices
concerning
her
but
now
that
she
is
perhaps
afflicted
poor
friendless
and
scorned
though
unjustly
by
every
virtuous
she
that
knows
her
story
i
can
not
command
my
feelings
when
she
is
named
with
sarcastic
respect
nor
can
i
bear
to
hear
an
unhappy
woman
supposed
to
be
plunged
in
the
lowest
depths
of
vice
whom
i
on
the
contrary
believe
to
be
at
this
moment
atoning
for
the
error
of
her
judgment
by
a
life
of
lonely
penitence
or
sunk
perhaps
already
in
the
grave
the
victim
of
a
broken
heart
colonel
mordaunt
affected
and
delighted
hung
on
emma
douglas
words
with
breathless
attention
resolving
when
she
had
ended
her
narration
to
begin
his
and
clear
adeline
from
the
calumnies
of
mrs
wallington
and
miss
maynard
but
after
articulating
with
some
difficulty
i
miss
douglas
i
he
found
that
his
feelings
would
not
allow
him
to
proceed
therefore
suddenly
raising
emma
hand
to
his
lips
imprinted
on
it
a
kiss
at
once
fervent
and
respectful
and
making
a
hasty
bow
ran
out
of
the
house
every
one
was
astonished
but
none
so
much
as
emma
douglas
emma
cried
the
major
should
have
thought
it
i
verily
believe
you
have
turned
mordaunt
head
i
protest
that
he
kissed
your
hand
i
suppose
he
will
be
here
making
proposals
in
form
wish
he
may
exclaimed
mrs
douglas
is
not
very
likely
i
think
cried
miss
maynard
mrs
wallington
said
nothing
but
she
fanned
herself
violently
do
you
know
that
said
maynard
kissed
your
hand
very
tenderly
did
he
not
miss
douglas
and
took
advantage
of
the
dark
hour
that
looks
very
emma
douglas
who
in
spite
of
her
reason
was
both
embarrassed
and
flattered
by
colonel
mordaunt
unexpected
mode
of
taking
leave
said
not
a
word
but
mrs
wallington
in
a
voice
hoarse
with
angry
emotion
cried
was
very
free
in
him
i
think
and
very
unlike
colonel
mordaunt
for
he
was
not
a
sort
of
man
to
take
liberties
but
where
he
met
with
encouragement
i
am
sure
he
would
be
free
with
you
sister
sometimes
sarcastically
observed
miss
maynard
with
both
of
you
i
think
replied
maynard
who
had
not
forgiven
the
laugh
at
his
expense
which
they
had
tried
to
excite
on
which
an
angry
dialogue
took
place
between
the
brother
and
sisters
and
the
douglases
disgusted
and
provoked
retired
to
their
apartment
was
something
very
strange
and
uncommon
said
mrs
douglas
detaining
emma
in
her
colonel
mordaunt
behaviour
do
you
not
think
so
emma
if
it
should
have
any
meaning
cried
the
major
meaning
should
it
have
why
my
dear
do
you
think
mordaunt
never
kissed
a
woman
hand
before
it
was
so
well
emma
if
it
should
lead
to
consequences
cried
the
major
dear
girl
what
can
you
mean
if
he
should
our
emma
then
i
hope
our
emma
will
love
what
say
you
emma
say
i
she
replied
i
never
thought
it
possible
that
colonel
mordaunt
should
have
any
thoughts
of
me
nor
do
i
now
but
it
is
very
strange
that
he
should
kiss
my
hand
the
major
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
of
this
reply
and
in
a
mutual
whisper
they
agreed
how
much
they
wished
to
see
their
sister
so
happily
disposed
of
while
emma
paced
up
and
down
her
own
apartment
some
time
before
she
undressed
herself
and
after
seeming
to
convince
herself
by
recollecting
all
colonel
mordaunt
conduct
towards
her
that
he
could
not
possibly
any
thing
by
his
unusual
adieu
she
went
to
sleep
exclaiming
it
is
very
strange
that
he
should
kiss
my
hand
chapter
xxiv
the
next
morning
explained
the
mystery
for
breakfast
was
scarcely
over
when
colonel
mordaunt
appeared
and
his
presence
occasioned
a
blush
from
different
causes
on
the
cheeks
of
all
the
ladies
and
a
smile
on
the
countenances
of
both
the
gentlemen
left
us
very
abruptly
last
night
said
major
douglas
did
so
replied
mordaunt
with
a
sort
of
grave
smile
you
taken
ill
asked
maynard
i
was
not
quite
easy
answered
he
miss
douglas
may
i
request
the
honour
of
seeing
you
alone
for
a
few
minutes
again
the
ladies
blushed
and
the
gentlemen
smiled
but
emma
weakness
had
been
temporary
she
had
convinced
herself
that
colonel
action
had
been
nothing
more
than
a
tribute
to
what
he
fancied
her
generous
defence
of
an
unfortunate
woman
and
with
an
air
of
embarrassed
dignity
she
gave
him
her
hand
to
lead
her
into
an
adjoining
apartment
is
very
good
of
you
cried
colonel
mordaunt
you
are
all
goodness
my
dear
miss
douglas
had
i
not
gone
away
as
i
did
last
night
i
believe
i
should
have
fallen
down
and
worshipped
you
or
committed
some
other
extravagance
what
could
i
say
to
excite
such
enthusiasm
replied
emma
deeply
blushing
oh
miss
douglas
then
after
a
few
more
ohs
and
other
exclamations
he
related
to
her
the
whole
progress
of
his
acquaintance
with
an
attachment
to
adeline
adding
as
he
concluded
then
judge
what
feelings
you
must
have
excited
in
my
bosom
yes
miss
douglas
i
reverenced
you
before
for
your
own
sake
i
now
adore
you
for
that
of
my
lost
adeline
thought
emma
kiss
of
the
hand
is
explained
and
she
sighed
as
she
thought
it
nor
did
she
much
like
the
word
but
she
had
ample
amends
for
her
mortification
by
what
followed
cried
colonel
mordaunt
gazing
very
earnestly
at
her
do
not
mean
to
flatter
you
but
there
is
something
in
your
countenance
that
reminds
me
very
strongly
of
adeline
it
possible
said
emma
her
cheeks
glowing
and
her
eyes
sparkling
as
she
spoke
may
not
mean
to
flatter
me
but
i
assure
you
i
am
flattered
for
i
never
saw
any
woman
whom
in
appearance
i
so
much
wished
to
resemble
do
resemble
her
indeed
cried
colonel
mordaunt
the
likeness
grows
stronger
and
stronger
emma
blushed
deeper
and
deeper
come
exclaimed
he
us
go
and
i
will
no
shall
relate
to
the
party
in
the
next
room
what
i
have
been
telling
you
for
i
long
to
shame
those
d
said
emma
smiling
and
holding
up
her
hand
as
if
to
stop
the
coming
word
and
she
did
stop
it
for
colonel
mordaunt
conveyed
the
reproving
hand
to
his
lips
and
emma
said
to
herself
as
she
half
frowning
withdrew
it
am
glad
my
brother
was
not
present
their
return
to
the
was
welcome
to
every
one
from
different
causes
as
colonel
mordaunt
motives
for
requesting
a
had
given
rise
to
various
conjectures
but
all
conjecture
was
soon
lost
in
certainty
for
emma
douglas
with
more
than
usual
animation
of
voice
and
countenance
related
what
colonel
mordaunt
had
authorized
her
to
relate
and
the
envious
sisters
heard
with
increased
resentment
that
adeline
were
she
unmarried
would
be
the
choice
of
the
man
whose
affections
they
were
eagerly
endeavouring
to
captivate
ca
think
said
colonel
mordaunt
when
emma
had
concluded
leaving
him
charmed
with
the
manner
in
which
she
had
told
his
story
and
with
the
generous
triumph
which
sparkled
in
her
eyes
at
being
able
to
exhibit
adeline
character
in
so
favourable
a
point
of
view
think
how
much
miss
douglas
reminds
me
of
mrs
berrendale
said
miss
maynard
with
a
toss
of
the
head
brother
told
us
that
she
was
handsome
so
she
is
replied
the
colonel
provoked
at
this
brutal
speech
has
one
of
the
finest
countenances
that
i
ever
saw
a
countenance
never
distorted
by
those
feelings
of
envy
and
expressions
of
spite
which
so
often
disfigure
some
women
converting
even
a
beauty
into
a
fiend
and
in
this
respect
no
one
will
doubt
that
miss
douglas
resembles
her
female
beauty
but
an
air
divine
thro
which
the
mind
all
gentle
graces
shine
says
one
of
our
first
poets
therefore
in
dr
young
opinion
madam
continued
mordaunt
turning
to
emma
would
have
been
a
perfect
beauty
this
speech
so
truly
gratifying
to
the
amiable
girl
to
whom
it
was
addressed
was
a
dagger
in
the
heart
of
both
the
sisters
nor
was
pleasure
unalloyed
by
pain
for
she
feared
that
mordaunt
attentions
might
become
dangerous
to
her
peace
of
mind
as
she
could
not
disguise
to
herself
that
his
visits
at
mr
maynard
had
been
the
chief
cause
of
her
reluctance
to
return
to
scotland
whenever
their
journey
home
was
mentioned
for
always
humble
in
her
ideas
of
her
own
charms
emma
douglas
could
not
believe
that
mordaunt
would
ever
entertain
any
feeling
for
her
at
all
resembling
love
except
when
he
fancied
that
she
looked
like
adeline
but
however
unlikely
it
seemed
that
mordaunt
should
become
attached
to
her
and
however
resolved
she
was
to
avoid
his
society
certain
it
is
that
he
soon
found
he
could
be
happy
in
the
society
of
no
other
woman
since
to
no
other
could
he
talk
on
the
subject
nearest
his
heart
and
emma
though
blaming
herself
daily
for
her
temerity
could
not
refuse
to
receive
mordaunt
visits
and
her
patient
attention
to
his
conversation
of
which
adeline
was
commonly
the
theme
seemed
to
have
a
salutary
effect
on
his
wounded
feelings
but
the
time
for
their
departure
arrived
much
to
the
joy
of
mrs
wallington
and
her
sister
who
hoped
when
emma
was
gone
to
have
a
chance
of
being
noticed
by
mordaunt
what
then
must
have
been
their
confusion
and
disappointment
when
colonel
mordaunt
begged
to
be
allowed
to
attend
the
douglases
on
their
journey
home
as
he
had
never
seen
the
highlands
and
wished
to
see
them
in
such
good
company
major
douglas
and
his
charming
wife
gave
a
glad
consent
to
this
proposal
but
emma
douglas
heard
it
with
more
alarm
than
pleasure
for
though
her
heart
rejoiced
at
it
her
reason
condemned
it
a
few
days
however
convinced
her
apprehensive
delicacy
that
if
she
loved
colonel
mordaunt
it
was
not
without
hope
of
a
return
colonel
mordaunt
declared
that
every
day
seemed
to
increase
her
resemblance
to
adeline
in
expression
and
manner
and
in
conduct
his
reason
told
him
that
she
was
her
superior
nor
could
he
for
a
moment
hesitate
to
prefer
as
a
wife
emma
douglas
who
had
never
erred
to
adeline
who
had
colonel
mordaunt
felt
to
borrow
the
words
of
a
celebrated
female
writer
that
it
is
possible
to
love
and
esteem
a
woman
who
has
expiated
the
faults
of
her
youth
by
a
sincere
repentance
and
though
before
god
and
man
her
errors
may
be
obliterated
still
there
exists
one
being
in
whose
eyes
she
can
never
hope
to
efface
them
and
that
is
her
lover
or
her
husband
he
felt
that
no
man
of
acute
sensibility
can
be
happy
with
a
woman
whose
recollections
are
not
pure
she
must
necessarily
be
jealous
of
the
opinion
which
he
entertains
of
her
and
he
must
be
often
afraid
of
speaking
lest
he
utter
a
sentiment
that
may
wound
and
mortify
her
besides
he
was
on
just
grounds
more
desirous
of
marrying
a
woman
whom
he
than
one
whom
he
forgave
and
therefore
while
he
addressed
emma
he
no
longer
regretted
adeline
madame
de
stael
de
morceaux
page
in
short
he
at
length
ceased
to
talk
of
emma
resemblance
to
adeline
but
seemed
to
admire
her
wholly
for
her
own
sake
and
having
avowed
his
attachment
and
been
assured
of
emma
in
return
by
major
douglas
he
came
back
to
england
in
the
ensuing
autumn
the
happy
husband
of
one
of
the
best
of
women
chapter
xxv
we
left
adeline
preparing
to
address
mrs
mowbray
and
recommend
her
child
to
her
protection
but
being
deeply
impressed
with
the
importance
of
the
task
which
she
was
about
to
undertake
she
timidly
put
it
off
from
day
to
day
and
having
convinced
herself
that
it
was
her
duty
to
endeavour
to
excite
her
husband
to
repentance
and
make
him
acknowledge
editha
as
his
legitimate
child
she
determined
to
write
to
him
before
she
addressed
her
mother
and
also
to
bid
a
last
farewell
to
colonel
mordaunt
whose
respectful
attachment
had
soothed
some
of
the
pangs
which
consciousness
of
her
past
follies
had
inflicted
and
whose
active
friendship
deserved
her
warmest
acknowledgment
little
did
she
think
the
fatal
effect
which
one
instance
of
his
friendly
zeal
in
her
cause
had
had
on
berrendale
unconscious
was
she
that
the
husband
whose
neglect
she
believed
to
be
intentional
great
as
were
his
crimes
against
her
was
not
guilty
of
the
additional
crime
of
suffering
her
to
pine
in
poverty
without
making
a
single
inquiry
concerning
her
but
was
convinced
that
both
she
and
her
child
were
no
longer
in
existence
in
her
letter
to
him
she
conjured
him
by
the
love
which
he
bore
glenmurray
by
the
love
he
bore
her
and
by
the
remorse
which
he
would
sooner
or
later
feel
for
his
conduct
towards
her
and
her
child
to
acknowledge
editha
to
be
his
lawful
heir
but
to
suffer
her
to
remain
under
that
protection
to
which
she
meant
to
bequeath
her
and
on
these
conditions
she
left
him
her
blessing
and
her
pardon
the
letter
to
colonel
mordaunt
was
long
and
perhaps
diffuse
but
adeline
was
jealous
of
his
esteem
though
regardless
of
his
love
and
as
he
had
known
her
while
acting
under
the
influence
of
a
fatal
error
of
opinion
she
wished
to
show
him
that
on
conviction
she
had
abandoned
her
former
way
of
thinking
and
was
candid
enough
to
own
that
she
had
been
wrong
no
doubt
she
said
well
acquainted
with
the
arguments
urged
by
different
writers
in
favour
of
marriage
i
shall
therefore
only
mention
the
argument
which
carried
at
length
full
conviction
to
mind
and
conquered
even
my
deep
and
heartfelt
reverence
for
the
opinions
of
one
who
long
was
and
ever
will
be
the
dearest
object
of
my
love
and
regret
but
had
he
lived
would
i
am
sure
have
altered
his
sentiments
and
had
he
been
a
parent
the
argument
i
allude
to
as
it
is
founded
on
a
consideration
of
the
interest
of
children
would
have
found
its
way
to
his
reason
through
his
affections
is
evident
that
on
the
education
given
to
children
must
depend
the
welfare
of
the
community
and
consequently
that
whatever
is
likely
to
induce
parents
to
neglect
the
education
of
their
children
must
be
to
the
welfare
of
the
community
it
is
also
certain
that
though
the
agency
of
the
be
necessary
to
the
existence
of
all
society
it
is
on
the
cultivation
and
influence
of
the
that
the
happiness
and
improvement
of
social
life
depend
it
follows
that
marriage
must
be
more
beneficial
to
society
in
its
consequences
than
connexions
capable
of
being
dissolved
at
pleasure
because
it
has
a
tendency
to
call
forth
and
exercise
the
affections
and
control
the
passions
it
has
been
said
that
were
we
free
to
dissolve
at
will
a
connexion
formed
by
love
we
should
not
wish
to
do
it
as
constancy
is
natural
to
us
and
there
is
in
all
of
us
a
tendency
to
form
an
exclusive
attachment
but
though
i
believe
from
my
own
experience
that
the
few
are
capable
of
unforced
constancy
and
could
love
for
life
one
dear
and
honoured
object
still
i
believe
that
the
many
are
given
to
the
love
of
change
that
in
men
especially
a
new
object
can
excite
new
passion
and
judging
from
the
increasing
depravity
of
both
sexes
in
spite
of
existing
laws
and
in
defiance
of
shame
i
am
convinced
that
if
the
ties
of
marriage
were
dissolved
or
it
were
no
longer
to
be
judged
infamous
to
act
in
contempt
of
them
unbridled
licentiousness
would
soon
be
in
general
practice
what
then
in
such
a
state
of
society
would
be
the
fate
of
the
children
born
in
it
what
would
their
education
be
parents
continually
engrossed
in
the
enervating
but
delightful
egotism
of
a
new
and
happy
love
lost
in
selfish
indulgence
the
passions
awake
but
the
affections
slumbering
and
the
sacred
ties
of
parental
feeling
not
having
time
nor
opportunity
to
fasten
on
the
heart
their
offspring
would
either
die
the
victims
of
neglect
and
the
very
existence
of
the
human
race
be
threatened
or
without
morals
or
instruction
they
would
grow
up
to
scourge
the
world
by
their
vices
till
the
whole
fabric
of
civilized
society
was
gradually
destroyed
this
ground
therefore
this
strong
ground
i
venture
to
build
my
present
opinion
that
marriage
is
a
wise
and
ought
to
be
a
sacred
institution
and
i
bitterly
regret
the
hour
when
with
the
hasty
and
immature
judgment
of
eighteen
and
with
a
degree
of
presumption
scarcely
pardonable
at
any
time
of
life
i
dared
to
think
and
act
contrary
to
this
opinion
and
the
reverend
experience
of
ages
and
became
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
an
example
of
vice
when
i
believed
myself
the
champion
of
virtue
she
then
went
on
to
express
the
following
sentiments
will
think
perhaps
that
i
ought
to
struggle
against
the
weakness
which
is
hurrying
me
to
the
grave
and
live
for
the
sake
of
my
alas
it
is
for
her
sake
that
i
most
wish
to
die
are
two
ways
in
which
a
mother
can
be
of
use
to
her
daughter
the
one
is
by
instilling
into
her
mind
virtuous
principles
and
by
setting
her
a
virtuous
example
the
other
is
by
being
to
her
in
her
own
person
an
awful
warning
a
melancholy
proof
of
the
dangers
which
attend
a
deviation
from
the
path
of
virtue
but
oh
how
jealous
must
a
mother
be
of
her
child
esteem
and
veneration
and
how
could
she
bear
to
humble
herself
in
the
eyes
of
the
beloved
object
by
avowing
that
she
had
committed
crimes
against
society
however
atoned
for
by
penitence
and
sorrow
i
can
never
now
be
a
correct
example
for
my
editha
nor
could
i
endure
to
live
to
be
a
warning
to
nay
if
i
lived
i
should
be
most
probably
a
dangerous
example
to
her
for
i
should
be
on
my
i
think
i
may
be
allowed
the
boast
respected
and
esteemed
while
the
society
around
me
would
forget
my
past
errors
in
the
sincerity
of
my
repentance
then
a
strong
temptation
should
assail
my
child
might
she
not
yield
to
it
from
an
idea
that
one
false
step
may
be
retrieved
and
cite
her
mother
as
an
example
of
this
truth
while
unconscious
of
the
many
secret
of
that
repentant
mother
unconscious
of
the
sorrows
and
degradations
she
had
experienced
she
regarded
nothing
but
the
present
respectability
of
her
mother
life
and
contented
herself
with
hoping
one
day
to
resemble
her
me
that
were
it
possible
for
me
to
choose
between
life
and
death
for
my
child
sake
the
choice
would
be
the
latter
now
when
she
shall
see
in
my
mournful
and
eventful
history
written
as
it
has
been
by
me
in
moments
of
melancholy
leisure
that
all
my
sorrows
were
consequent
on
one
presumptuous
error
of
judgment
in
early
youth
and
shall
see
a
long
and
minute
detail
of
the
secret
agonies
which
i
have
endured
those
agonies
wearing
away
my
existence
and
ultimately
hurrying
me
to
an
untimely
grave
she
will
learn
that
the
woman
who
feels
justly
yet
has
been
led
even
into
the
practice
of
vice
however
she
may
be
forgiven
by
others
can
never
forgive
herself
and
though
she
may
dare
to
lift
an
eye
of
hope
to
that
being
who
promises
pardon
on
repentance
she
will
still
recollect
with
anguish
the
fair
and
glorious
course
which
she
might
have
run
and
that
instead
of
humbly
imploring
forbearance
and
forgiveness
she
might
have
demanded
universal
respect
and
esteem
it
is
that
i
did
not
act
in
defiance
of
the
world
opinion
from
any
depraved
feeling
or
vicious
inclinations
but
the
world
could
not
be
expected
to
believe
this
since
motives
are
known
only
to
our
own
hearts
and
the
great
searcher
of
hearts
therefore
as
far
as
example
goes
i
was
as
great
a
to
others
as
if
the
life
i
led
had
been
owing
to
the
influence
of
lawless
desires
and
society
was
right
in
making
and
in
seeing
no
distinction
between
me
and
any
other
woman
living
in
an
unsanctioned
connexion
methinks
i
hear
you
say
that
editha
might
never
be
informed
of
my
past
errors
alas
wretched
must
that
woman
be
whose
happiness
and
respectability
depend
on
the
secrecy
of
others
besides
did
i
not
think
the
concealment
of
crime
in
itself
a
crime
how
could
i
know
an
hour
of
peace
while
i
reflected
that
a
moment
malice
or
inadvertency
in
one
of
editha
companions
might
cause
her
to
blush
at
her
disgrace
that
while
her
young
cheek
was
flushed
perhaps
with
the
artless
triumphs
of
beauty
talent
and
virtue
the
parent
who
envied
me
or
the
daughter
who
envied
her
might
suddenly
convert
her
joy
into
anguish
and
mortification
by
artfully
informing
her
with
feigned
pity
for
my
sorrows
and
admiration
of
my
penitence
that
i
had
once
been
a
to
that
family
of
which
i
was
now
the
pride
no
even
if
i
were
not
for
ever
separated
in
this
world
from
the
only
man
whom
i
ever
loved
with
passionate
and
affection
united
for
life
to
the
object
of
my
just
aversion
and
were
i
not
conscious
horrible
and
overwhelming
thought
of
having
by
my
example
led
another
into
the
path
of
sin
still
i
repeat
it
for
my
child
sake
i
should
wish
to
die
and
should
consider
not
early
death
but
lengthened
existence
as
a
curse
so
adeline
reasoned
and
felt
in
her
moments
of
reflection
but
the
heart
had
sometimes
dominion
over
her
and
as
she
gazed
on
editha
and
thought
that
mrs
mowbray
might
be
induced
to
receive
her
again
to
her
favour
she
wished
even
on
any
terms
to
have
her
life
prolonged
chapter
xxvi
having
finished
her
letter
to
colonel
mordaunt
and
berrendale
she
again
prepared
to
write
to
her
mother
a
few
transient
fears
overcoming
every
now
and
then
those
hopes
of
success
in
her
application
which
till
she
took
up
her
pen
she
had
so
warmly
encouraged
alas
little
did
she
know
how
erroneously
for
years
she
had
judged
of
mrs
mowbray
little
did
she
suspect
that
her
mother
had
long
forgiven
her
had
pined
after
her
had
sought
though
in
vain
to
procure
intelligence
of
her
and
was
then
wearing
away
her
existence
in
solitary
woe
a
prey
to
and
to
the
corroding
fear
that
her
daughter
made
desperate
by
her
renunciation
of
her
had
on
the
death
of
glenmurray
plunged
into
a
life
of
shame
or
sunk
into
the
grave
for
not
one
of
adeline
letters
had
ever
reached
mrs
mowbray
and
the
mother
and
daughter
had
both
been
the
victims
of
female
treachery
and
jealousy
mrs
mowbray
as
soon
as
she
had
parted
with
adeline
for
the
last
time
had
dismissed
all
her
old
servants
the
witnesses
of
her
sorrows
and
disgrace
and
retired
to
her
estate
in
cumberland
an
estate
where
adeline
had
first
seen
the
light
and
where
mrs
mowbray
had
first
experienced
the
transport
of
a
mother
this
spot
was
therefore
ill
calculated
to
banish
adeline
from
her
mother
thoughts
and
to
continue
her
seclusion
from
her
affections
on
the
contrary
her
image
haunted
mrs
mowbray
whithersoever
she
went
she
still
saw
her
in
an
attitude
of
supplication
she
still
heard
the
plaintive
accents
of
her
voice
and
often
did
she
exclaim
child
my
child
wretch
that
i
am
must
i
never
see
thee
more
these
ideas
increased
to
so
painful
a
degree
that
finding
her
solitude
insupportable
she
invited
an
orphan
relation
in
narrow
circumstances
to
take
up
her
abode
with
her
this
young
woman
whose
ruling
passion
was
avarice
and
whose
greatest
talent
was
cunning
resolved
to
spare
no
pains
to
keep
the
situation
which
she
had
gained
even
to
the
exclusion
of
adeline
should
mrs
mowbray
be
weak
enough
to
receive
her
again
she
therefore
intercepted
all
the
letters
which
were
in
or
like
adeline
and
having
learnt
to
imitate
mrs
mowbray
she
enclosed
them
in
a
blank
cover
to
adeline
who
thinking
the
direction
was
written
in
her
mother
hand
desisted
as
the
artful
girl
expected
she
would
do
from
what
appeared
to
her
a
hopeless
application
and
she
exulted
in
her
contrivance
when
mrs
mowbray
on
seeing
in
a
magazine
that
glenmurray
was
dead
full
a
year
after
his
decease
bursting
into
a
passion
of
tears
protested
that
she
would
instantly
invite
adeline
to
her
house
cried
she
can
do
so
without
infringement
of
my
she
is
disgraced
in
the
eye
of
the
world
by
her
connexion
with
glenmurray
and
she
is
wretched
in
love
nay
more
so
perhaps
than
i
have
been
and
i
can
i
will
invite
her
to
lose
the
remembrance
of
her
misfortunes
in
my
love
thus
did
her
ardent
wish
to
be
to
adeline
deceive
her
conscience
for
by
the
phrase
in
love
she
meant
forsaken
by
the
object
of
her
attachment
and
that
adeline
had
not
been
therefore
her
oath
remained
in
full
force
against
her
but
where
could
she
seek
adeline
dr
norberry
could
perhaps
give
her
this
information
and
to
him
she
resolved
to
write
though
he
had
cast
her
from
his
acquaintance
her
pride
as
she
said
with
her
fortunes
and
she
scrupled
not
to
humble
herself
before
the
zealous
friend
of
her
daughter
but
this
letter
would
never
have
reached
him
had
not
her
treacherous
relation
been
ill
at
the
time
when
it
was
written
dr
norberry
had
recovered
the
illness
of
which
adeline
supposed
him
to
have
died
but
as
her
letter
to
him
to
which
she
received
no
answer
alluded
to
the
money
transaction
between
her
and
mrs
norberry
and
as
she
commented
on
the
insulting
expressions
in
mrs
norberry
note
that
lady
thought
proper
to
suppress
the
second
letter
as
well
as
the
first
and
when
the
doctor
on
his
recovery
earnestly
demanded
to
know
whether
any
intelligence
had
been
received
of
miss
mowbray
mrs
norberry
with
pretended
reluctance
told
him
that
she
had
written
to
him
in
great
distress
while
he
was
delirious
to
borrow
money
that
she
had
sent
her
ten
pounds
which
adeline
had
returned
reproaching
her
for
her
parsimony
and
saying
that
she
had
found
a
friend
who
would
not
suffer
her
to
want
did
you
tell
her
that
you
thought
me
in
great
danger
did
what
woman
did
she
not
after
that
write
to
know
how
i
was
could
not
have
thought
it
of
her
answered
the
doctor
who
could
not
but
believe
this
story
for
the
sake
of
his
own
peace
as
it
was
less
destructive
to
his
happiness
to
think
adeline
in
fault
than
his
wife
or
children
guilty
of
profligate
falsehood
he
therefore
with
a
deep
sigh
begged
adeline
name
might
never
be
mentioned
to
him
again
and
though
he
secretly
wished
to
hear
of
her
welfare
he
no
longer
made
her
the
subject
of
conversation
but
mrs
mowbray
letter
recalled
her
powerfully
both
to
his
memory
and
affections
while
with
many
a
sigh
he
regretted
that
he
had
no
possible
means
of
discovering
where
she
was
and
with
a
heavy
heart
he
wrote
the
following
letter
which
miss
woodville
mrs
relation
having
first
contrived
to
open
and
read
it
ventured
to
give
into
her
hands
as
it
contained
no
satisfactory
information
concerning
adeline
look
on
the
separation
of
my
mother
and
me
in
this
world
to
be
eternal
said
the
poor
dear
lost
adeline
to
me
the
last
time
we
met
do
replied
i
poor
devil
how
miserable
will
your
mother
be
when
her
resentment
subsides
well
when
that
time
comes
i
may
perhaps
see
her
again
added
i
with
a
queer
something
rising
in
my
throat
as
i
said
it
and
your
poor
girl
blessed
me
for
the
kind
pshaw
i
have
blotted
the
paper
at
my
years
it
is
a
shame
to
be
so
well
the
time
is
come
you
are
miserable
you
are
repentant
and
you
ask
me
to
forget
and
i
do
forget
i
do
forgive
some
time
or
other
too
i
will
tell
you
so
in
person
and
were
the
lost
adeline
to
know
that
i
did
so
she
would
bless
me
for
the
act
as
she
did
before
for
the
intention
but
alas
where
she
is
what
she
is
i
know
not
and
have
not
any
means
of
knowing
to
say
the
truth
her
conduct
to
me
and
mine
has
been
odd
not
to
say
wrong
but
poor
thing
she
is
either
dead
or
miserable
and
i
forgive
her
so
i
do
you
as
i
said
before
and
the
lord
give
you
all
the
consolation
which
you
so
greatly
need
yours
once
more
in
true
kindness
of
spirit
james
norberry
this
letter
made
mrs
mowbray
wounds
bleed
afresh
at
the
same
time
that
it
destroyed
all
her
expectations
of
finding
adeline
and
the
only
hope
that
remained
to
cheer
her
was
that
she
might
perhaps
if
yet
alive
write
sooner
or
later
to
implore
forgiveness
but
month
after
month
elapsed
and
no
tidings
of
adeline
reached
her
despairing
mother
she
then
put
an
advertisement
in
the
paper
so
worded
that
adeline
had
she
seen
it
must
have
known
to
whom
it
alluded
but
it
never
met
her
eyes
and
mrs
mowbray
gave
herself
up
to
almost
absolute
despair
when
accident
introduced
her
to
a
new
acquaintance
whose
example
taught
her
patience
and
whose
soothing
benevolence
bade
her
hope
for
happier
days
one
day
as
mrs
mowbray
regardless
of
a
heavy
shower
and
lost
in
melancholy
reflections
was
walking
with
irregular
steps
on
the
road
to
penrith
with
an
unopened
umbrella
in
her
hand
she
suddenly
raised
her
eyes
from
the
ground
and
beheld
a
quaker
lady
pursued
by
an
bullock
and
unable
any
longer
to
make
an
effort
to
escape
its
fury
at
this
critical
moment
mrs
mowbray
from
a
sort
of
irresistible
impulse
as
fortunate
in
its
effects
as
presence
of
mind
yet
scarcely
perhaps
to
be
denominated
such
suddenly
opened
her
umbrella
and
approaching
the
animal
brandished
it
before
his
eyes
alarmed
at
this
unusual
appearance
he
turned
hastily
and
ran
towards
the
town
where
she
saw
that
he
was
immediately
met
and
secured
hast
doubtless
saved
my
life
said
the
quaker
grasping
mrs
mowbray
hand
with
an
emotion
which
she
vainly
tried
to
suppress
i
pray
that
thine
may
be
blest
mrs
mowbray
returned
the
pressure
of
her
hand
and
burst
into
tears
overcome
with
joy
for
having
saved
a
life
with
terror
which
she
was
now
at
leisure
to
feel
for
the
danger
to
which
she
had
herself
been
exposed
and
with
mournful
emotion
from
the
consciousness
how
much
she
needed
the
blessing
which
the
grateful
quaker
invoked
on
her
head
tremblest
even
more
than
i
do
observed
the
lady
smiling
but
seeming
ready
to
faint
believe
we
had
better
both
of
us
sit
down
on
the
bank
but
it
is
so
wet
that
perhaps
we
may
as
well
endeavour
to
reach
my
house
which
is
only
at
the
end
of
yon
field
mrs
mowbray
bowed
her
assent
and
supporting
each
other
they
at
length
arrived
at
a
neat
white
house
to
which
the
quaker
cordially
bade
her
welcome
was
but
this
morning
said
mrs
mowbray
struggling
for
utterance
i
called
upon
death
to
relieve
me
from
an
existence
at
once
wretched
and
useless
here
she
paused
and
her
new
acquaintance
cordially
pressing
her
hand
waited
for
the
conclusion
of
her
speech
now
continued
mrs
mowbray
revoke
and
repent
my
idle
and
vicious
impatience
of
life
i
have
probably
saved
your
life
and
something
like
enjoyment
now
seems
to
enliven
mine
suspect
replied
the
lady
thou
hast
known
deep
affliction
and
i
rejoice
that
at
this
moment
and
in
so
providential
a
manner
i
have
been
introduced
to
thy
acquaintance
for
i
too
have
known
sorrow
and
the
mourner
knows
how
to
speak
comfort
to
the
heart
of
the
mourner
my
name
is
rachel
pemberton
and
i
hope
that
when
i
know
thy
name
and
thy
story
thou
wilt
allow
me
to
devote
to
thy
comfort
some
hours
of
the
existence
which
thou
hast
preserved
she
then
hastily
withdrew
to
pour
forth
in
solitude
the
breathings
of
devout
gratitude
while
mrs
mowbray
having
communed
with
her
own
thoughts
felt
a
glow
of
unwonted
satisfaction
steal
over
her
mind
and
by
the
time
mrs
pemberton
returned
she
was
able
to
meet
her
with
calmness
and
cheerfulness
knowest
my
name
said
mrs
pemberton
as
she
entered
seating
herself
by
mrs
mowbray
i
have
yet
to
learn
thine
name
is
mowbray
she
replied
sighing
deeply
the
lady
of
rosevalley
in
gloucestershire
and
the
mother
of
adeline
mowbray
exclaimed
mrs
pemberton
of
adeline
mowbray
what
of
my
child
cried
mrs
mowbray
seizing
mrs
pemberton
hand
woman
tell
me
do
you
indeed
know
her
can
you
tell
me
where
to
find
her
will
tell
thee
all
that
i
know
of
her
replied
mrs
pemberton
in
a
faltering
voice
thy
emotion
overpowers
i
i
was
once
a
mother
and
i
can
feel
for
thee
she
then
turned
away
her
head
to
conceal
a
starting
tear
while
mrs
mowbray
in
incoherent
eagerness
repeated
her
questions
and
tremblingly
awaited
her
answer
she
well
is
she
happy
say
but
that
she
exclaimed
sobbing
as
she
spoke
was
well
and
contented
when
i
last
heard
from
her
replied
mrs
pemberton
calmly
from
her
then
she
writes
to
you
oh
blessed
blessed
woman
show
me
her
letters
and
tell
me
only
that
she
has
forgiven
me
for
all
my
unkindness
to
her
as
she
said
this
mrs
mowbray
threw
her
arms
round
mrs
pemberton
and
sunk
on
her
shoulder
will
tell
thee
all
that
has
ever
passed
between
us
if
thou
wilt
be
composed
gravely
answered
mrs
pemberton
this
violent
expression
of
thy
feelings
is
unseemly
and
detrimental
well
i
will
be
calm
said
mrs
mowbray
and
mrs
pemberton
began
to
relate
the
interview
which
she
had
with
adeline
at
richmond
long
ago
did
this
take
place
eagerly
interrupted
mrs
mowbray
six
years
god
exclaimed
she
impatiently
years
by
this
time
then
she
may
be
dead
she
may
art
incorrigible
i
fear
said
mrs
pemberton
thou
art
afflicted
and
i
will
bear
with
thy
impatience
sit
down
again
and
attend
to
me
and
thou
wilt
hear
much
later
intelligence
of
thy
daughter
late
asked
mrs
mowbray
with
frantic
eagerness
and
mrs
pemberton
overcome
with
the
manner
in
which
she
spoke
could
scarcely
falter
out
a
twelvemonth
i
have
heard
of
her
a
twelvemonth
joyfully
cried
mrs
mowbray
but
recollecting
herself
she
added
mournfully
in
that
time
what
what
may
not
have
happened
know
not
what
to
do
with
thee
nor
for
thee
observed
mrs
pemberton
do
try
i
beseech
thee
to
hear
me
patiently
mrs
mowbray
then
herself
and
mrs
pemberton
informed
her
of
adeline
premature
confinement
at
richmond
of
her
distress
on
glenmurray
death
and
of
her
having
witnessed
it
you
acted
a
mother
part
you
did
what
i
ought
to
have
done
cried
mrs
mowbray
bursting
into
tears
go
on
i
will
be
patient
yet
that
was
impossible
for
when
she
heard
of
adeline
insanity
her
emotions
became
so
strong
that
mrs
pemberton
alarmed
for
her
life
was
obliged
to
ring
for
assistance
when
she
recovered
hast
heard
the
worst
now
said
mrs
pemberton
all
i
have
yet
to
say
of
thy
child
is
satisfactory
she
then
related
the
contents
of
adeline
first
letter
informing
her
of
her
marriage
and
mrs
mowbray
clasping
her
hands
together
blessed
god
that
adeline
was
become
a
wife
the
next
letter
mrs
pemberton
read
informed
her
that
she
was
the
mother
of
a
fine
girl
mother
she
exclaimed
how
i
should
like
to
see
her
child
but
at
the
same
moment
she
recollected
how
bitterly
she
had
reviled
her
when
she
saw
her
about
to
become
a
mother
at
their
last
meeting
and
torn
with
conflicting
emotions
she
was
again
insensible
to
aught
but
her
but
where
is
she
now
where
is
the
child
and
when
did
you
hear
from
her
last
cried
she
have
not
heard
from
her
since
hesitatingly
replied
mrs
pemberton
ca
you
write
to
her
but
in
her
last
letter
she
said
she
was
going
to
change
her
lodgings
and
would
write
again
when
settled
in
a
new
habitation
again
mrs
mowbray
paced
the
room
in
wild
and
violent
distress
but
her
sorrows
at
length
yielded
to
the
gentle
admonitions
and
soothings
of
mrs
pemberton
who
bade
her
remember
that
when
she
rose
in
the
morning
she
had
not
expected
the
happiness
and
consolation
which
she
had
met
with
that
day
and
that
a
short
time
might
bring
forth
still
greater
comfort
said
mrs
pemberton
can
write
to
the
house
where
she
formerly
lodged
and
perhaps
the
person
who
keeps
it
can
give
us
intelligence
of
her
on
hearing
this
mrs
mowbray
became
more
composed
and
diverted
her
sorrow
by
a
thousand
fond
inquiries
concerning
adeline
which
none
but
a
mother
could
make
and
none
but
a
mother
could
listen
to
with
patience
while
this
conversation
was
going
on
a
knock
at
the
door
was
heard
and
miss
woodville
entered
the
room
in
great
emotion
for
she
had
heard
on
the
road
that
a
mad
bullock
had
attacked
a
lady
and
also
that
mrs
mowbray
scarcely
able
to
walk
had
been
led
into
the
white
house
in
the
field
by
the
road
side
miss
woodville
was
certainly
as
much
alarmed
as
she
pretended
to
be
but
there
was
a
somewhat
in
the
expression
of
her
alarm
which
though
it
gratified
mrs
mowbray
was
displeasing
to
the
more
penetrating
mrs
pemberton
she
could
not
indeed
guess
that
miss
woodville
alarm
sprung
merely
from
apprehension
lest
mrs
mowbray
should
die
before
she
had
provided
for
her
in
her
will
yet
notwithstanding
she
felt
that
her
expressions
of
concern
and
anxiety
had
no
resemblance
to
those
of
real
affection
and
in
spite
of
her
habitual
candour
she
beheld
miss
woodville
with
distrust
but
this
feeling
was
considerably
increased
on
observing
that
when
mrs
mowbray
exultingly
introduced
her
not
only
as
the
lady
whose
life
she
had
been
the
means
of
preserving
but
as
the
friend
and
correspondent
of
her
daughter
she
evidently
changed
colour
and
in
spite
of
her
habitual
plausibility
could
not
utter
a
single
coherent
sentence
of
pleasure
or
congratulation
and
it
was
also
evident
that
being
conscious
of
mrs
pemberton
regarding
her
with
a
scrutinizing
eye
she
was
not
easy
till
on
pretence
of
mrs
mowbray
requiring
rest
after
her
alarm
she
had
prevailed
on
her
to
return
home
but
she
could
not
prevent
the
new
friends
from
parting
with
eager
assurances
of
meeting
again
and
again
and
it
was
agreed
between
them
that
mrs
pemberton
should
spend
the
next
day
at
the
lawn
mrs
pemberton
who
is
thus
again
introduced
to
the
notice
of
my
readers
had
been
as
well
as
mrs
mowbray
the
pupil
of
adversity
she
had
been
born
and
educated
in
fashionable
life
and
she
united
to
a
very
lovely
face
and
elegant
form
every
feminine
grace
and
accomplishment
when
she
was
only
eighteen
mr
pemberton
a
young
and
gay
quaker
fell
in
love
with
her
and
having
inspired
her
with
a
mutual
passion
he
married
her
notwithstanding
the
difference
of
their
religious
opinions
and
the
displeasure
of
his
friends
he
was
consequently
disowned
by
the
society
but
being
weaned
by
the
happiness
which
he
found
at
home
from
those
public
amusements
which
had
first
lured
him
from
the
strict
habits
of
his
sect
he
was
soon
desirous
of
being
again
admitted
a
member
of
it
and
in
process
of
time
he
was
once
more
received
into
it
while
his
amiable
wife
having
no
wish
beyond
her
domestic
circle
and
being
disposed
to
think
her
husband
opinions
right
became
in
time
a
convert
to
the
same
profession
of
faith
and
exhibited
in
her
manners
the
rare
union
of
the
easy
elegance
of
a
woman
of
the
world
with
the
rigid
decorum
and
unadorned
dress
of
a
strict
quaker
but
in
the
midst
of
her
happiness
and
whilst
looking
forward
to
a
long
continuance
of
it
a
fever
caught
in
visiting
the
sick
bed
of
a
cottager
carried
off
her
husband
and
next
two
lovely
children
and
mrs
pemberton
would
have
sunk
under
the
stroke
but
for
the
watchful
care
and
affectionate
attentions
of
the
friend
of
her
youth
who
resided
near
her
and
who
in
time
prevailed
on
her
to
receive
with
becoming
fortitude
and
resignation
the
trials
which
she
was
appointed
to
undergo
during
this
season
of
affliction
as
we
have
before
stated
she
became
a
minister
in
the
quaker
society
but
at
the
time
of
her
meeting
adeline
at
richmond
she
had
been
called
from
the
duties
of
her
public
profession
to
watch
over
the
declining
health
of
her
friend
and
consoler
and
to
accompany
her
to
lisbon
there
during
four
long
years
she
bent
over
her
sick
couch
now
elated
with
hope
and
now
sunk
into
despondence
when
at
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
year
her
friend
died
in
her
arms
and
she
returned
to
england
resolved
to
pass
her
days
except
when
engaged
in
active
duties
on
a
little
estate
in
cumberland
bequeathed
to
her
by
her
friend
on
her
but
ill
health
and
various
events
had
detained
her
in
the
west
of
england
since
her
return
and
she
had
not
long
taken
possession
of
her
house
near
penrith
when
she
became
introduced
in
so
singular
a
manner
to
mrs
mowbray
acquaintance
an
acquaintance
which
would
she
hoped
prove
of
essential
service
to
them
both
and
as
soon
as
her
guest
departed
mrs
pemberton
resolved
to
inquire
what
character
mrs
mowbray
bore
in
the
neighbourhood
and
whether
her
virtues
at
all
kept
pace
with
her
misfortunes
her
inquiries
were
answered
in
the
most
satisfactory
manner
as
fortunately
for
mrs
mowbray
with
the
remembrance
of
her
daughter
had
recurred
to
her
that
daughter
benevolent
example
she
remembered
the
satisfaction
which
used
to
beam
from
adeline
countenance
when
she
returned
from
her
visits
to
the
sick
and
the
afflicted
and
she
resolved
to
try
whether
those
habits
of
charitable
exertion
which
could
increase
the
happiness
of
the
young
and
adeline
might
not
have
power
to
alleviate
the
sorrows
of
her
own
drooping
age
and
broken
joyless
heart
are
the
uses
of
adversity
she
who
while
the
child
of
prosperity
was
a
romantic
indolent
theorist
an
inactive
speculator
a
proud
contemner
of
the
dictates
of
sober
experience
and
a
neglecter
of
that
practical
benevolence
which
can
in
days
produce
more
benefit
to
others
than
theories
and
theorists
can
accomplish
in
years
this
erring
woman
awakened
from
her
dreams
and
reveries
to
habits
of
useful
exertion
by
the
stimulating
touch
of
affliction
was
become
the
visitor
of
the
sick
the
consoler
of
the
sorrowful
the
parent
of
the
fatherless
while
virtuous
industry
looked
up
to
her
with
hope
and
her
name
like
that
of
adeline
in
happier
days
was
pronounced
with
prayers
and
blessings
but
alas
she
felt
that
blessing
could
reach
her
only
in
the
shape
of
her
lost
child
and
though
she
was
conscious
of
being
useful
to
others
though
she
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
she
had
but
the
day
before
been
the
means
of
preserving
a
valuable
life
she
met
mrs
pemberton
when
she
arrived
at
the
lawn
with
a
countenance
of
fixed
melancholy
and
was
at
first
disposed
to
expect
but
little
success
from
the
project
of
writing
to
adeline
former
lodgings
in
order
to
inquire
the
truth
was
that
miss
woodville
had
artfully
insinuated
the
improbability
of
such
an
inquiry
succeeding
and
though
mrs
mowbray
had
angrily
asserted
her
hopes
when
miss
woodville
provokingly
asserted
her
the
treacherous
girl
insinuations
had
sunk
deeply
into
her
mind
and
mrs
pemberton
saw
with
pain
and
wonder
an
effect
produced
of
which
the
cause
was
wholly
unseen
but
she
at
length
succeeded
in
awakening
mrs
mowbray
hopes
and
in
a
letter
written
by
mrs
pemberton
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
whence
adeline
formerly
dated
she
enclosed
one
to
her
daughter
glowing
with
maternal
tenderness
and
calculated
to
speak
peace
to
her
sorrows
these
letters
were
sent
as
soon
as
written
to
the
post
by
mrs
mowbray
footman
but
miss
woodville
contrived
to
meet
him
near
the
and
telling
him
she
would
put
the
letter
in
the
receiver
she
gave
him
a
commission
to
call
at
a
shop
in
penrith
for
her
at
which
she
had
not
time
to
call
herself
thus
was
another
scheme
for
restoring
adeline
to
her
afflicted
mother
frustrated
by
the
treachery
of
this
interested
woman
who
while
mrs
pemberton
and
mrs
mowbray
looked
anxiously
forward
to
the
receipt
of
an
answer
from
london
triumphed
with
malignant
pleasure
in
the
success
of
her
but
spite
of
herself
she
feared
mrs
pemberton
and
was
not
at
all
pleased
to
find
that
till
the
answer
from
london
could
arrive
that
lady
was
to
remain
at
the
lawn
she
contrived
however
to
be
as
little
in
her
presence
as
possible
for
contrary
to
mrs
pemberton
usual
habits
she
felt
a
distrust
of
miss
woodville
which
her
intelligent
eye
could
not
help
expressing
and
which
consequently
alarmed
the
conscious
heart
of
the
culprit
being
left
therefore
by
miss
woodville
fears
alone
with
mrs
mowbray
she
drew
from
her
at
different
times
ample
details
of
childhood
and
the
method
which
mrs
mowbray
had
pursued
in
her
education
is
as
i
suspected
interrupted
mrs
pemberton
during
one
of
these
conversations
daughter
originated
in
thee
her
education
was
cruelly
defective
replied
mrs
mowbray
with
almost
angry
eagerness
my
errors
as
a
mother
have
been
and
for
the
rash
marriage
which
i
made
i
own
myself
culpable
in
the
highest
degree
i
am
sure
that
i
paid
the
greatest
attention
to
my
daughter
education
if
you
were
but
to
see
the
voluminous
manuscript
on
the
subject
which
i
wrote
for
her
improvement
where
was
thy
daughter
and
how
was
she
employed
during
the
time
that
thou
wert
writing
a
book
by
which
to
educate
her
mrs
mowbray
was
silent
she
recollected
that
while
she
was
gratifying
her
own
vanity
in
composing
her
system
of
education
adeline
was
almost
banished
her
presence
and
but
for
the
humble
instruction
of
her
grandmother
would
at
the
age
of
fifteen
have
run
a
great
risk
of
being
both
an
ignorant
and
useless
being
me
friend
mowbray
resumed
mrs
pemberton
aware
in
some
measure
of
what
was
passing
in
mrs
mowbray
mind
me
if
i
venture
to
observe
that
till
of
late
years
a
thick
curtain
of
seems
to
have
been
dropped
between
thy
heart
and
maternal
affection
it
is
now
and
now
only
that
thou
hast
learned
to
feel
like
a
true
and
affectionate
mother
you
are
right
replied
mrs
mowbray
mournfully
i
always
meant
well
and
hoped
that
my
studies
would
conduce
to
the
benefit
of
my
child
they
might
perhaps
to
that
of
thy
second
third
or
fourth
child
hadst
thou
been
possessed
of
so
many
but
in
the
meanwhile
thy
must
have
been
fatally
neglected
a
child
education
begins
almost
from
the
hour
of
its
birth
and
the
mother
who
understands
her
task
knows
that
the
circumstances
which
every
moment
calls
forth
are
the
tools
with
which
she
is
to
work
in
order
to
fashion
her
child
mind
and
character
what
would
you
think
of
the
farmer
who
was
to
let
his
fields
lie
fallow
for
years
while
he
was
employed
in
contriving
a
method
of
cultivating
land
to
increase
his
gains
i
did
not
suffer
adeline
mind
to
lie
i
allowed
her
to
read
and
i
directed
her
studies
didst
so
but
what
were
those
studies
and
didst
thou
acquaint
thyself
with
the
deductions
which
her
quick
mind
formed
from
them
no
thou
didst
not
as
parents
should
do
inquire
into
the
impressions
made
on
thy
daughter
mind
by
the
books
which
she
perused
prompt
to
feel
and
hasty
to
decide
as
adeline
was
how
necessary
was
to
her
the
warning
voice
of
judgment
and
experience
how
could
i
imagine
that
a
girl
so
young
should
dare
to
act
whatever
her
opinions
might
be
in
open
defiance
of
the
opinions
of
the
world
she
had
not
lived
in
the
world
therefore
scarcely
knew
how
repugnant
to
it
her
opinions
were
nor
as
she
did
not
mix
in
general
society
could
she
care
sufficiently
for
its
good
opinion
to
be
willing
to
act
contrary
to
her
own
ideas
of
right
rather
than
forfeit
it
besides
thou
ownest
that
thou
didst
openly
profess
thy
admiration
of
the
sentiments
which
she
adopted
nor
till
they
were
confirmed
irrevocably
hers
didst
thou
declare
that
to
act
up
to
them
was
in
thy
opinion
vicious
and
then
it
was
too
late
she
thought
thy
timidity
and
not
thy
wisdom
spoke
and
she
set
thee
the
virtuous
example
of
acting
up
to
the
dictates
of
conscience
but
adeline
and
thou
are
both
the
pupils
of
affliction
and
experience
and
i
trust
that
all
your
errors
repented
of
you
will
meet
once
more
to
expiate
your
past
follies
by
your
future
conduct
hope
so
too
meekly
replied
mrs
mowbray
whose
pride
had
been
completely
subdued
by
and
distress
when
when
will
an
answer
arrive
from
london
chapter
xxvii
alas
day
after
day
elapsed
and
no
letter
came
but
while
mrs
mowbray
was
almost
frantic
with
disappointment
and
anxiety
mrs
pemberton
thought
that
she
observed
in
miss
woodville
countenance
a
look
of
triumphant
malice
which
ill
accorded
with
the
fluent
expressions
of
sympathy
and
regret
with
which
she
gratified
her
unsuspicious
relation
and
she
determined
to
watch
her
very
narrowly
for
she
thought
it
strange
that
adeline
however
she
might
respect
her
mother
oath
should
never
in
the
bitterness
of
her
sorrows
have
unburthened
her
heart
by
imparting
them
to
her
one
day
when
as
usual
the
post
had
been
anxiously
expected
and
as
usual
had
brought
no
letter
from
london
concerning
adeline
and
while
miss
woodville
was
talking
on
indifferent
subjects
with
ill
suppressed
gaiety
though
mrs
mowbray
sunk
into
despondence
was
lying
on
the
sofa
by
her
mrs
pemberton
suddenly
exclaimed
is
only
one
right
way
of
proceeding
friend
mowbray
thou
and
i
must
go
to
london
and
make
our
inquiries
in
person
and
then
we
shall
have
a
great
chance
of
succeeding
as
she
said
this
she
looked
steadfastly
at
miss
woodville
and
saw
her
turn
very
pale
while
her
eye
was
hastily
averted
from
the
penetrating
glance
of
mrs
pemberton
and
when
she
heard
mrs
mowbray
in
a
transport
of
joy
declare
that
they
had
better
set
off
that
very
evening
unable
to
conceal
her
terror
and
agitation
she
hastily
left
the
room
mrs
pemberton
instantly
followed
her
into
the
apartment
to
which
she
had
retired
and
the
door
of
which
she
had
closed
with
much
violence
she
found
her
walking
to
and
fro
and
wringing
her
hands
as
if
in
agony
on
seeing
mrs
pemberton
she
started
and
sinking
into
a
chair
she
complained
of
being
very
ill
and
desired
to
be
left
alone
art
ill
and
thy
illness
is
of
the
worst
sort
i
fear
replied
mrs
pemberton
i
will
stay
and
be
thy
physician
my
physician
replied
miss
woodville
with
fury
in
her
looks
i
see
that
thou
art
afraid
lest
adeline
should
be
restored
to
her
paternal
roof
told
you
so
officious
insolent
woman
returned
miss
woodville
own
looks
but
all
this
is
very
natural
in
thee
thou
fearest
that
adeline
favour
should
annihilate
thine
i
do
cried
miss
woodville
a
little
less
alarmed
and
catching
at
this
plausible
excuse
for
her
uneasiness
should
i
be
forced
to
leave
my
cousin
house
i
shall
be
reduced
to
comparative
poverty
and
solitude
again
why
shouldest
thou
be
forced
to
leave
it
art
thou
not
friend
yes
faltered
out
miss
woodville
it
is
uncertain
whether
we
can
find
adeline
still
we
shall
be
very
diligent
in
our
inquiries
yet
it
is
so
strange
that
she
should
never
have
written
to
her
mother
if
alive
that
perhaps
i
dare
say
she
is
dead
hastily
interrupted
miss
woodville
she
been
dead
long
thinkest
thou
not
long
not
above
six
months
i
dare
say
hast
thou
any
reason
then
for
knowing
that
she
was
alive
six
months
ago
asked
mrs
pemberton
looking
steadily
at
miss
woodville
as
she
spoke
lord
no
how
should
i
know
she
replied
her
lip
quivering
and
her
whole
frame
trembling
tell
thee
art
thou
not
conscious
of
having
intercepted
letters
from
thy
cousin
to
her
relenting
parent
mrs
pemberton
had
scarcely
uttered
these
words
when
miss
woodville
fell
back
nearly
in
her
chair
a
proof
that
the
accusation
was
only
too
well
founded
as
soon
as
she
recovered
mrs
pemberton
said
with
great
gentleness
art
ill
ill
indeed
but
as
i
suspected
thy
illness
is
of
the
mind
there
is
a
load
of
guilt
on
it
throw
it
off
then
by
a
full
confession
and
be
the
sinner
that
repenteth
in
a
few
moments
miss
woodville
conscious
that
her
emotion
had
betrayed
her
and
suspecting
that
mrs
pemberton
had
by
some
means
or
other
received
hints
of
her
treachery
confessed
that
she
had
intercepted
and
destroyed
letters
from
adeline
to
her
mother
and
also
owned
to
the
great
joy
of
mrs
pemberton
that
adeline
last
letter
the
letter
in
which
she
informed
mrs
mowbray
that
all
the
conditions
were
then
fulfilled
without
which
alone
she
had
sworn
never
to
forgive
her
had
arrived
only
two
months
before
and
that
it
was
dated
from
such
a
street
and
such
a
number
in
london
poor
friend
will
be
so
happy
said
mrs
pemberton
and
her
own
eyes
filling
with
tears
of
joy
she
hastened
to
find
mrs
mowbray
what
will
become
of
exclaimed
miss
woodville
detaining
her
am
ruined
ruined
for
ever
so
replied
mrs
pemberton
art
saved
i
trust
for
thou
hast
confessed
thy
guilt
and
made
all
the
atonement
now
in
thy
power
go
to
thine
own
room
and
i
will
soon
make
known
to
thee
thy
relation
sentiments
towards
thee
so
saying
she
hastened
to
mrs
mowbray
whom
she
found
giving
orders
with
eager
impatience
to
have
post
horses
sent
for
immediately
thou
art
full
of
expectation
i
conclude
from
the
event
of
our
journey
to
town
said
mrs
pemberton
smiling
be
sure
i
am
replied
mrs
mowbray
so
am
i
she
answered
i
think
that
i
know
the
present
abode
of
thy
daughter
mrs
mowbray
started
her
friend
countenance
expressed
more
joy
and
exultation
than
she
had
ever
seen
on
it
before
and
almost
breathless
with
new
hope
she
seized
her
hand
and
conjured
her
to
explain
herself
the
explanation
was
soon
given
and
mrs
mowbray
joy
in
consequence
of
it
unbounded
what
is
thy
will
observed
mrs
pemberton
regard
to
thy
guilty
relation
can
not
can
not
see
her
again
now
if
ever
and
she
must
immediately
leave
my
house
but
i
will
settle
on
her
a
handsome
allowance
for
my
conscience
tells
me
that
had
i
behaved
like
a
mother
to
my
child
no
one
could
have
been
tempted
to
injure
her
thus
i
put
this
unhappy
woman
into
a
state
of
temptation
and
she
yielded
to
it
but
i
feel
only
too
sensibly
that
no
one
has
been
such
an
enemy
to
my
poor
adeline
as
i
have
been
nor
conscious
of
my
own
offences
towards
her
dare
i
resent
those
of
another
love
i
honour
thee
for
what
thou
hast
now
uttered
cried
mrs
pemberton
with
unusual
see
that
thou
art
now
indeed
a
christian
such
are
the
breathings
of
a
truly
contrite
spirit
and
verily
she
who
can
so
easily
forgive
the
crimes
of
others
may
hope
to
have
her
own
forgiven
mrs
pemberton
then
hastened
to
speak
hope
and
comfort
to
the
mind
of
the
penitent
offender
while
mrs
mowbray
ran
to
meet
her
servant
who
to
her
surprise
was
returning
without
horses
for
none
were
to
be
procured
and
mrs
mowbray
saw
herself
obliged
to
delay
her
journey
till
noon
the
next
day
when
she
was
assured
of
having
horses
from
penrith
but
when
after
a
long
and
restless
night
she
arose
in
the
morning
anticipating
with
painful
impatience
the
hour
of
her
departure
mrs
pemberton
entered
her
room
and
informed
her
that
she
had
passed
nearly
all
the
night
at
miss
woodville
who
had
been
seized
with
a
violent
delirium
at
one
in
the
morning
and
in
her
ravings
was
continually
calling
on
mrs
mowbray
and
begging
to
see
her
once
more
will
see
her
directly
replied
mrs
mowbray
without
a
hesitation
and
hastened
to
miss
woodville
apartment
where
she
found
the
medical
attendant
whom
mrs
pemberton
had
sent
for
just
arrived
he
immediately
declared
the
disorder
to
be
an
inflammation
on
the
brain
and
left
them
with
little
or
no
hope
of
her
recovery
mrs
mowbray
affected
beyond
measure
at
the
pathetic
appeals
for
pardon
addressed
to
her
continually
by
the
unconscious
sufferer
took
her
station
at
the
and
hanging
over
her
pillow
watched
for
the
slightest
gleam
of
returning
reason
in
order
to
speak
the
pardon
so
earnestly
implored
and
while
thus
piously
engaged
the
chaise
that
was
to
convey
her
and
her
friend
to
london
and
perhaps
to
adeline
drove
up
to
the
gate
thou
ready
said
mrs
pemberton
entering
the
room
equipped
for
her
journey
at
this
moment
the
poor
invalid
reiterated
her
cries
for
pardon
and
begged
mrs
mowbray
not
to
leave
her
without
pronouncing
her
forgiveness
mrs
mowbray
burst
into
tears
and
though
sure
that
she
was
not
even
conscious
of
her
presence
she
felt
herself
almost
unable
to
forsake
her
still
it
was
in
search
of
her
daughter
that
she
was
going
nay
perhaps
it
was
to
her
daughter
that
she
was
hastening
and
as
this
thought
occurred
to
her
she
hurried
to
the
door
of
the
chamber
saying
she
should
be
ready
in
a
moment
but
the
eye
of
the
phrensied
sufferer
followed
her
as
she
did
so
and
in
a
tone
of
unspeakable
agony
she
begged
she
entreated
that
she
might
not
be
left
to
die
in
solitude
and
sorrow
however
guilty
she
might
have
then
again
she
implored
mrs
mowbray
to
speak
peace
and
pardon
to
her
drooping
soul
while
unable
to
withstand
these
solicitations
though
she
knew
them
to
be
the
unconscious
ravings
of
the
disorder
she
slowly
and
mournfully
returned
to
the
is
late
said
mrs
pemberton
ought
ere
now
to
be
on
the
road
can
i
go
and
leave
this
poor
creature
in
such
a
state
but
then
should
we
find
my
poor
injured
child
at
the
end
of
the
journey
such
an
expectation
as
that
must
decide
quickly
replied
mrs
pemberton
gently
then
i
will
go
with
yet
still
should
anna
recover
her
senses
before
her
death
and
wish
to
see
me
i
should
never
forgive
myself
for
being
absent
it
might
soothe
the
anguish
of
her
last
moments
to
know
how
freely
i
pardon
no
no
after
all
if
pleasure
awaits
me
it
is
only
delaying
it
a
few
days
and
this
this
unhappy
girl
is
on
her
you
you
must
go
me
as
she
said
this
mrs
pemberton
pressed
her
hand
with
affectionate
eagerness
and
murmured
out
in
broken
accents
honour
thy
decision
and
may
i
return
with
comfort
to
thee
though
i
wish
you
to
go
cried
mrs
mowbray
grieve
to
expose
you
to
such
fatigue
and
trouble
in
your
weak
state
of
health
and
no
more
interrupted
mrs
pemberton
am
only
doing
my
duty
and
reflect
on
my
happiness
if
i
am
allowed
to
restore
the
lost
sheep
to
the
fold
again
so
saying
she
set
off
on
her
journey
and
arrived
in
london
only
four
days
after
adeline
had
arrived
in
cumberland
mrs
pemberton
drove
immediately
to
adeline
lodgings
but
received
the
same
answer
as
colonel
mordaunt
had
received
namely
that
she
was
gone
no
one
knew
whither
still
she
did
not
despair
of
finding
her
she
like
the
colonel
thought
that
a
mulatto
a
lady
just
recovered
from
the
and
a
child
were
likely
to
be
easily
traced
and
having
written
to
mrs
mowbray
owning
her
disappointment
but
bidding
her
not
despair
she
set
off
on
her
journey
back
and
had
succeeded
in
tracing
adeline
as
far
as
an
inn
on
the
high
north
road
when
an
event
took
place
which
made
her
further
inquiries
needless
chapter
xxviii
adeline
after
several
repeated
trials
succeeded
in
writing
the
following
letter
to
her
mother
of
mothers
this
letter
reaches
you
i
shall
be
no
more
and
however
i
may
hitherto
have
offended
you
i
shall
then
be
able
to
offend
you
no
longer
and
that
child
whom
you
bound
yourself
by
oath
never
to
see
or
forgive
but
on
the
most
cruel
of
conditions
while
living
dead
you
may
perhaps
deign
to
receive
to
your
pardon
and
your
nay
my
heart
tells
me
that
you
will
do
more
that
you
will
transfer
the
love
which
you
once
felt
for
me
to
my
poor
helpless
orphan
and
in
full
confidence
that
you
will
be
this
indulgent
i
bequeath
her
to
you
with
my
dying
o
look
on
her
my
mother
nor
shrink
from
her
with
disgust
although
you
see
in
her
my
features
but
rather
rejoice
in
the
resemblance
and
fancy
that
i
am
restored
to
you
pure
happy
and
beloved
as
i
once
yes
yes
it
will
be
so
i
have
known
a
great
deal
of
sorrow
let
me
then
indulge
the
little
ray
of
pleasure
that
breaks
in
upon
me
when
i
think
that
you
will
not
resist
my
dying
prayer
but
bestow
on
my
child
the
long
arrears
of
tenderness
due
to
me
yes
you
will
receive
you
will
be
kind
to
her
and
by
so
doing
you
will
make
me
ample
amends
for
all
the
sorrow
which
your
harshness
caused
me
when
we
met
that
was
a
dreadful
day
how
you
frowned
on
me
i
did
not
think
you
could
have
frowned
so
dreadfully
but
then
i
was
uninjured
by
affliction
unaltered
by
illness
were
you
to
see
me
now
you
would
not
have
the
heart
to
frown
on
me
and
yet
my
letters
being
repeatedly
returned
and
even
the
last
unnoticed
and
unanswered
though
it
told
you
that
even
on
your
own
conditions
i
could
now
claim
your
pardon
for
that
i
had
been
wretched
in
love
and
had
experienced
the
anguish
of
being
forsaken
despised
and
disgraced
in
the
eye
of
the
world
proves
but
too
surely
that
the
bitterness
of
resentment
is
not
yet
passed
but
on
my
you
promised
to
see
and
forgive
me
i
am
there
my
yet
will
i
not
claim
that
promise
i
will
not
weaken
by
directing
it
towards
myself
the
burst
of
sorrow
of
too
late
regret
of
and
affection
which
must
be
directed
towards
my
child
when
i
am
not
alive
to
profit
by
it
no
though
i
would
give
worlds
to
embrace
you
once
more
for
the
sake
of
my
child
i
resign
the
gratification
mother
you
little
think
that
i
saw
you
only
a
few
days
ago
from
the
stile
by
the
cottage
which
overlooks
your
house
you
were
walking
with
a
lady
and
my
child
was
with
me
my
editha
for
i
have
called
her
after
you
you
seemed
methought
even
cheerful
and
i
was
so
selfish
that
i
felt
shocked
to
think
i
was
so
entirely
forgotten
by
you
for
i
was
sure
that
if
you
thought
of
me
you
could
not
be
cheerful
but
your
companion
left
you
and
then
you
looked
so
very
sad
that
i
was
wretched
from
the
idea
that
you
were
then
thinking
too
much
of
me
and
i
wished
you
to
resume
your
cheerfulness
again
was
not
cheerful
and
editha
by
her
artless
prattle
wounded
me
to
the
very
she
wished
she
said
to
live
in
that
sweet
house
and
asked
why
she
should
not
live
there
have
told
her
why
but
dared
not
do
it
but
i
assured
her
and
do
not
for
mercy
sake
prove
that
assurance
false
that
she
live
there
but
when
when
she
asked
when
i
am
in
my
grave
replied
i
and
poor
innocent
throwing
herself
into
my
arms
with
playful
fondness
she
begged
me
to
go
to
my
grave
directly
i
feel
but
too
sensibly
that
her
desire
will
soon
be
accomplished
must
i
die
unblest
by
you
true
i
am
watched
by
the
kindest
of
human
beings
but
then
she
is
not
my
mother
that
mother
who
with
the
joys
of
my
childhood
and
my
home
is
so
continually
recurring
to
my
memory
oh
i
forget
all
your
unkindness
my
mother
and
remember
only
your
affection
how
i
should
like
to
feel
your
hand
supporting
my
head
and
see
you
perform
the
little
offices
which
sickness
requires
and
must
i
never
never
see
you
more
yes
you
will
come
i
am
sure
you
will
but
come
come
quickly
or
i
shall
die
without
your
blessing
have
had
a
fainting
fit
but
i
am
recovered
and
can
address
you
oh
teach
my
editha
to
be
humble
teach
her
to
be
slow
to
call
the
experience
of
ages
contemptible
prejudices
teach
her
no
opinions
that
can
destroy
her
sympathies
with
general
society
and
make
her
an
alien
to
the
hearts
of
those
amongst
whom
she
lives
above
all
things
careful
that
she
wanders
not
in
the
night
of
scepticism
but
for
the
support
of
religion
what
amidst
my
various
sorrows
what
would
have
become
of
is
something
more
that
i
would
say
should
my
existence
be
prolonged
even
but
a
few
days
i
shall
have
to
struggle
with
poverty
as
well
as
sickness
and
the
anxious
friend
i
will
not
call
her
servant
who
is
now
my
all
of
earthly
comfort
will
scarcely
have
money
sufficient
to
pay
me
the
last
sad
duties
and
i
owe
her
my
mother
a
world
of
obligation
she
will
make
my
last
moments
easy
and
must
reward
her
from
her
you
will
receive
this
letter
when
i
am
no
more
and
to
your
care
and
protection
i
bequeath
her
she
is
my
eyes
grow
dim
and
i
must
leave
off
for
the
present
on
the
very
evening
in
which
adeline
had
written
this
address
to
her
mother
mrs
mowbray
had
received
mrs
pemberton
letter
and
as
miss
woodville
had
been
interred
that
morning
she
felt
herself
at
liberty
to
join
mrs
pemberton
in
her
search
after
adeline
while
various
plans
for
this
purpose
presented
themselves
to
her
mind
and
each
of
them
was
dismissed
in
its
turn
as
fruitless
or
impracticable
full
of
these
thoughts
she
pensively
walked
along
the
lawn
before
her
door
till
sad
and
weary
she
leaned
on
a
little
gate
at
the
bottom
of
it
which
as
she
did
so
swung
slowly
backwards
and
forwards
responsive
as
it
were
to
her
feelings
but
as
she
continued
to
muse
and
to
recall
the
varied
sorrows
of
her
past
life
the
gate
on
which
she
leaned
began
to
vibrate
more
quickly
till
unable
to
bear
the
recollections
which
assailed
her
she
was
hastening
with
almost
frantic
speed
towards
the
house
when
she
saw
a
cottager
approaching
to
whose
sick
daughter
and
helpless
family
she
had
long
been
a
bountiful
benefactress
is
the
matter
john
cried
mrs
mowbray
hastening
forward
to
meet
him
seem
agitated
poor
daughter
madam
replied
the
man
bursting
into
tears
at
the
sight
of
his
distress
his
distress
mrs
mowbray
sighed
deeply
and
asked
if
lucy
was
worse
doubt
she
is
dying
said
the
afflicted
father
forbid
exclaimed
mrs
mowbray
throwing
her
shawl
over
her
shoulders
will
go
and
see
her
myself
really
but
the
way
is
so
long
and
the
road
is
so
miry
matter
i
must
do
my
duty
bless
you
and
reward
you
cried
the
grateful
father
is
so
like
you
lucy
said
you
would
come
mrs
mowbray
then
filled
a
basket
with
medicine
and
refreshments
and
set
out
on
her
charitable
visit
she
found
the
poor
girl
in
a
very
weak
and
alarming
state
but
the
sight
of
her
benefactress
and
the
tender
manner
in
which
she
supported
her
languid
head
and
administered
wine
and
other
cordials
to
her
insensibly
revived
her
and
while
writhing
under
the
feelings
of
an
unhappy
parent
herself
mrs
mowbray
was
soothed
by
the
blessings
of
the
parent
whom
she
comforted
at
this
moment
they
were
alarmed
by
a
shriek
from
a
neighbouring
cottage
and
a
woman
who
was
attending
on
the
sick
girl
ran
out
to
inquire
into
the
cause
of
it
she
returned
saying
that
a
poor
sick
young
gentlewoman
who
lodged
at
the
next
house
was
fallen
back
in
a
fit
and
they
thought
she
was
dead
young
gentlewoman
exclaimed
mrs
mowbray
the
next
cottage
rising
up
sure
cried
the
woman
looks
like
a
lady
for
certain
and
she
has
the
finest
child
i
ever
saw
she
is
not
dead
said
mrs
mowbray
us
go
see
chapter
xxix
little
did
mrs
mowbray
think
that
it
was
her
own
child
whom
she
was
hastening
to
relieve
and
that
while
meditating
a
kind
action
recompense
was
so
near
adeline
while
trying
to
finish
her
letter
to
her
mother
had
scarcely
traced
a
few
illegible
lines
when
she
fell
back
insensible
on
her
pillow
and
at
the
moment
of
mrs
mowbray
entering
the
cottage
savanna
who
had
uttered
the
shriek
which
had
excited
her
curiosity
had
convinced
herself
that
she
was
gone
for
ever
the
woman
who
accompanied
mrs
mowbray
entered
the
house
first
and
opening
a
back
chamber
narrow
and
lighted
only
by
one
solitary
and
slender
candle
mrs
mowbray
beheld
through
the
door
the
lifeless
form
of
the
object
of
her
solicitude
which
savanna
was
contemplating
with
loud
and
frantic
sorrow
is
a
lady
come
to
see
what
she
can
do
for
your
mistress
cried
the
woman
while
savanna
turned
hastily
round
she
is
here
is
good
madam
mowbray
mowbray
shrieked
savanna
fixing
her
dark
eyes
on
mrs
mowbray
and
raising
her
arm
in
a
threatening
manner
as
she
approached
her
then
snatching
up
the
letter
which
lay
on
the
bed
she
exclaimed
grasping
mrs
mowbray
arm
with
frightful
earnestness
that
is
for
you
mrs
mowbray
speechless
with
alarm
and
awe
involuntarily
seized
the
letter
but
scarcely
had
she
read
the
first
words
when
uttering
a
deep
groan
she
sprung
forward
to
clasp
the
unconscious
form
before
her
and
fell
beside
it
equally
insensible
but
she
recovered
almost
immediately
to
a
sense
of
her
misery
and
while
in
speechless
agony
she
knelt
by
the
savanna
beholding
her
distress
with
a
sort
of
dreadful
pleasure
exclaimed
have
you
at
last
learn
to
feel
is
she
is
she
gone
cried
mrs
mowbray
there
hope
and
instantly
seizing
the
cordial
which
she
had
brought
with
her
assisted
by
the
woman
she
endeavoured
to
force
it
down
the
throat
of
adeline
their
endeavours
were
for
some
time
vain
at
length
however
she
exhibited
signs
of
life
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
she
opened
her
sunk
eye
and
gazed
unconsciously
around
her
god
i
thank
you
exclaimed
mrs
mowbray
falling
on
her
knees
while
savanna
laying
her
mistress
head
on
her
bosom
sobbed
with
fearful
joy
my
child
my
dear
dear
child
cried
mrs
mowbray
seizing
her
clammy
hand
that
voice
those
words
which
she
had
so
long
wished
to
hear
though
hopeless
of
ever
hearing
them
again
seemed
to
recall
the
fast
fading
recollection
of
adeline
she
raised
her
head
from
savanna
bosom
and
looking
earnestly
at
mrs
mowbray
faintly
smiled
and
endeavoured
to
throw
herself
into
her
arms
but
fell
back
again
exhausted
on
the
pillow
but
in
a
few
minutes
she
recovered
so
far
as
to
be
able
to
speak
and
while
she
hung
round
her
mother
neck
and
gazed
upon
her
with
eager
and
delighted
earnestness
she
desired
savanna
to
bring
editha
to
her
immediately
you
will
you
said
adeline
vainly
trying
to
speak
her
wishes
as
savanna
put
the
sleeping
girl
in
mrs
mowbray
arms
but
she
easily
divined
them
and
clasping
her
to
her
heart
wept
over
her
convulsively
shall
be
dear
to
me
as
my
own
soul
said
mrs
mowbray
i
die
contented
replied
adeline
exclaimed
mrs
mowbray
hastily
you
must
not
shall
not
die
you
must
live
to
see
me
atone
for
is
in
vain
said
adeline
faintly
bless
god
that
he
allows
me
to
enjoy
this
consolation
say
that
you
forgive
me
you
oh
adeline
for
years
have
i
forgiven
and
pined
after
you
but
a
wicked
woman
intercepted
all
your
letters
and
i
thought
you
were
dead
or
had
renounced
me
for
ever
cried
adeline
had
i
suspected
that
more
mrs
pemberton
is
now
in
london
in
search
of
you
in
order
to
bring
you
back
to
happiness
as
mrs
mowbray
said
this
savanna
drawing
near
took
her
hand
and
gently
pressed
it
adeline
observed
the
action
and
seeing
by
it
that
savanna
heart
relented
towards
her
mother
said
owe
that
faithful
creature
more
than
i
can
express
but
to
your
care
i
bequeath
her
will
love
her
as
my
child
said
mrs
mowbray
behave
to
her
better
than
i
did
to
cried
adeline
putting
her
hand
to
mrs
mowbray
lips
you
live
i
will
send
for
dr
norberry
you
shall
be
moved
to
my
house
and
all
will
be
well
all
our
past
grief
be
forgotten
returned
mrs
mowbray
with
almost
convulsive
eagerness
adeline
faintly
smiled
but
repeated
that
every
hope
of
that
kind
was
over
but
that
her
utmost
wish
has
gratified
in
seeing
her
mother
and
receiving
her
full
forgiveness
you
must
live
for
my
sake
cried
mrs
mowbray
for
mine
sobbed
out
savanna
you
not
be
moved
to
my
house
said
mrs
mowbray
every
indulgence
and
attention
that
money
can
procure
shall
be
yours
is
this
a
place
is
this
poverty
this
here
her
voice
failed
her
and
she
burst
into
tears
dearest
mother
replied
adeline
see
you
i
am
assured
of
your
love
again
and
i
have
not
a
want
beside
still
i
could
like
i
could
wish
to
be
once
more
under
a
in
a
moment
the
cottager
who
was
present
and
returning
with
usury
to
mrs
mowbray
daughter
the
anxious
interest
which
she
had
taken
in
his
proposed
various
means
of
transporting
adeline
to
the
lawn
a
difficult
and
a
hazardous
undertaking
but
the
poor
invalid
was
willing
to
risk
the
danger
and
the
fatigue
and
her
mother
could
not
but
indulge
her
at
length
the
cottager
as
it
was
for
the
having
with
care
procured
even
more
assistance
than
was
necessary
adeline
was
conveyed
on
a
sort
of
a
litter
along
the
valley
and
found
herself
once
more
in
the
house
of
her
mother
while
savanna
sharing
in
the
joy
which
adeline
countenance
expressed
threw
herself
on
mrs
mowbray
neck
and
exclaimed
i
forgive
you
dear
mother
cried
adeline
after
having
for
some
minutes
vainly
endeavoured
to
speak
am
so
happy
no
more
an
outcast
but
under
my
mother
roof
nay
i
even
think
i
live
now
added
she
with
a
faint
smile
had
adeline
risen
from
her
bed
in
complete
health
and
vigour
she
would
scarcely
have
excited
more
joy
in
her
mother
and
in
savanna
than
she
did
by
this
expression
live
cried
mrs
mowbray
you
shall
you
must
live
and
an
express
was
sent
off
immediately
to
dr
norberry
too
who
was
removed
to
kendal
to
be
near
his
elder
daughter
lately
married
in
the
neighbourhood
dr
norberry
arrived
in
a
few
hours
mrs
mowbray
ran
out
to
meet
him
but
a
welcome
died
on
her
tongue
and
she
could
only
speak
by
her
tears
there
my
good
woman
do
be
foolish
replied
he
is
very
silly
to
blubber
you
know
besides
it
can
do
no
good
giving
her
a
kiss
while
the
tears
trickled
down
his
rough
cheek
the
lost
sheep
is
found
o
she
will
be
lost
again
faltered
mrs
mowbray
doubt
nothing
can
save
her
cried
the
old
man
with
a
gulp
not
my
coming
so
many
miles
on
purpose
well
but
where
is
she
will
see
you
presently
but
begged
to
be
excused
for
a
few
minutes
see
said
he
my
dress
what
has
happened
gulping
as
he
spoke
have
lost
the
companion
of
thirty
years
and
and
here
he
paused
and
after
an
effort
went
on
to
say
that
his
wife
in
her
last
illness
had
owned
that
she
had
suppressed
adeline
letters
and
had
declared
the
reason
of
it
poor
soul
continued
the
doctor
was
the
only
sin
against
me
i
believe
or
any
one
else
that
she
ever
committed
so
i
forgave
her
and
i
trust
that
god
will
soon
after
they
were
summoned
to
the
sick
room
and
dr
norberry
beheld
with
a
degree
of
fearful
emotion
which
he
vainly
endeavoured
to
hide
under
a
cloak
of
pleasantry
the
dreadful
ravages
which
sorrow
and
sickness
had
made
in
the
face
and
form
of
adeline
here
you
are
at
last
cried
he
trying
to
smile
while
he
sobbed
audibly
a
pretty
figure
you
make
do
you
but
we
have
you
again
and
we
will
not
part
with
you
so
soon
i
can
tell
you
almost
starting
as
the
faint
but
rapid
pulse
met
his
fingers
that
is
i
mean
added
he
it
please
god
mrs
mowbray
and
savanna
during
this
speech
gazed
on
his
countenance
in
breathless
anxiety
and
read
in
it
a
confirmation
of
their
fears
who
afraid
cried
the
doctor
forcing
a
laugh
while
his
tone
and
his
looks
expressed
the
extreme
of
apprehension
and
his
laugh
ended
in
a
sob
mrs
mowbray
turned
away
in
a
sort
of
desperate
silence
but
the
mulatto
still
kept
her
penetrating
eye
fixed
upon
him
and
with
a
look
so
full
of
woe
trouble
you
mistress
to
take
those
formidable
eyes
of
yours
off
my
face
cried
the
doctor
pettishly
i
ca
stand
their
inquiry
but
who
the
devil
are
you
is
my
nurse
my
consoler
and
my
friend
said
adeline
she
is
mine
of
course
cried
the
doctor
she
has
a
terrible
stare
with
her
eyes
but
give
me
your
hand
mistress
what
is
your
name
be
name
savanna
replied
the
mulatto
me
die
and
live
wid
my
dear
mistress
she
added
bursting
into
tears
cried
the
doctor
ca
bear
this
here
i
came
as
a
physician
and
these
blubberers
melt
me
down
into
an
old
woman
adeline
i
must
order
all
these
people
out
of
the
room
and
have
you
to
myself
or
i
can
do
nothing
he
was
obeyed
and
on
inquiring
into
all
adeline
symptoms
he
found
little
to
hope
and
every
thing
to
fear
your
mind
is
relieved
and
you
have
youth
on
your
side
and
who
knows
what
good
air
good
food
and
good
nurses
may
do
for
you
to
mention
a
good
physician
added
adeline
smiling
a
good
friend
in
that
physician
it
be
to
have
money
said
savanna
as
she
saw
the
various
things
prepared
and
made
to
tempt
adeline
weak
appetite
savanna
mean
as
well
her
heart
make
all
these
but
her
hand
want
power
during
this
state
of
alarming
suspense
mrs
pemberton
was
hourly
expected
as
she
had
written
word
that
she
had
traced
adeline
into
lancashire
and
suspected
that
she
was
in
her
mother
it
may
be
supposed
that
mrs
mowbray
adeline
and
savanna
looked
forward
to
her
arrival
with
eager
impatience
but
not
so
dr
norberry
he
said
that
no
doubt
she
was
a
very
good
sort
of
woman
but
that
he
did
not
like
pretensions
to
righteousness
over
much
and
had
a
particular
aversion
to
a
piece
of
formal
morality
adeline
only
laughed
at
these
prejudices
without
attempting
to
confute
them
for
she
knew
that
mrs
pemberton
appearance
and
manners
would
soon
annihilate
them
at
length
she
reached
the
lawn
and
savanna
who
saw
her
alight
announced
her
arrival
to
her
mistress
and
was
commissioned
by
her
to
introduce
her
immediately
into
the
sick
she
did
so
but
mrs
pemberton
almost
overpowered
with
joy
at
the
intelligence
which
awaited
her
and
ill
fortified
by
violent
and
mixed
emotions
against
the
indulgence
of
her
own
begged
to
compose
herself
a
few
moments
before
she
met
adeline
but
savanna
was
not
to
be
denied
and
seizing
her
hand
she
led
her
up
to
the
bedside
of
the
adeline
smiled
affectionately
when
she
saw
her
but
mrs
pemberton
started
back
and
scarcely
staying
to
take
the
hand
which
she
offered
her
rushed
out
of
the
room
to
vent
in
solitude
the
burst
of
uncontrollable
anguish
which
the
sight
of
her
altered
countenance
occasioned
alas
her
eye
had
been
but
too
well
tutored
to
read
the
characters
of
death
in
the
face
and
it
was
some
time
before
she
recovered
herself
sufficiently
to
appear
before
the
anxious
watchers
by
the
bed
of
adeline
with
that
composure
which
on
principle
she
always
endeavoured
to
at
length
however
she
the
room
and
approaching
the
poor
invalid
kissed
in
silence
her
wan
flushed
cheek
am
very
different
now
my
kind
friend
to
what
i
was
when
you
saw
me
said
adeline
faintly
smiling
to
the
moment
when
they
met
adeline
had
not
resolution
enough
to
revert
for
then
she
was
mourning
by
the
dead
body
of
glenmurray
mrs
pemberton
was
silent
for
a
moment
but
making
an
effort
she
replied
art
now
more
like
what
thou
wert
in
when
i
met
thee
at
rosevalley
than
when
i
first
saw
thee
at
richmond
at
rosevalley
i
beheld
thee
innocent
at
richmond
guilty
and
here
i
see
thee
penitent
and
i
hope
resigned
to
thy
fate
she
spoke
the
word
with
emphasis
and
adeline
her
am
indeed
resigned
replied
adeline
in
a
low
voice
i
feel
that
i
am
much
favoured
in
being
spared
so
long
but
there
is
one
thing
that
weighs
heavily
on
my
mind
mary
warner
is
leading
a
life
of
shame
and
she
told
me
when
i
last
saw
her
that
she
was
corrupted
by
my
precept
and
example
if
so
thy
conscience
at
rest
on
that
subject
interrupted
mrs
pemberton
she
lived
with
me
i
discovered
long
before
she
ever
saw
thee
that
she
had
been
known
to
have
been
faulty
what
a
load
have
you
removed
from
my
mind
replied
adeline
it
would
be
more
relieved
if
you
would
promise
to
find
her
out
and
she
may
be
heard
of
at
mr
langley
chambers
in
the
temple
offer
her
a
yearly
allowance
for
life
provided
she
will
quit
her
present
vicious
habits
i
am
sure
my
mother
will
gladly
fulfil
my
wishes
in
this
respect
so
will
i
replied
mrs
pemberton
there
any
thing
else
that
i
can
do
for
thee
i
have
two
pensioners
at
richmond
a
poor
young
woman
and
her
orphan
boy
an
illegitimate
child
she
added
deeply
sighing
as
she
recollected
what
had
interested
her
in
their
fate
bequeath
them
to
your
care
savanna
knows
where
they
are
to
be
found
and
now
all
that
disturbs
my
thoughts
at
this
awful
moment
is
the
grief
which
my
poor
mother
and
savanna
will
feel
nay
they
will
be
quite
unprepared
for
it
for
they
persist
to
hope
still
and
i
believe
that
even
dr
norberry
allows
his
wishes
to
deceive
his
judgment
will
suffer
indeed
cried
mrs
pemberton
i
give
thee
my
word
that
i
will
never
leave
thy
mother
and
that
savanna
shall
be
our
joint
care
is
enough
i
shall
now
die
in
peace
said
adeline
and
mrs
pemberton
turned
away
to
meet
mrs
mowbray
who
with
dr
norberry
at
that
moment
entered
the
room
mrs
mowbray
met
her
and
welcomed
her
audibly
and
joyfully
but
mrs
pemberton
aware
of
the
blow
which
impended
over
her
vainly
endeavoured
to
utter
a
congratulation
but
throwing
herself
into
mrs
mowbray
extended
arms
she
forgot
her
usual
and
sobbed
loudly
on
her
bosom
dr
norberry
gazed
at
the
benevolent
quaker
with
astonishment
true
she
was
but
where
was
the
repulsive
formality
that
he
had
expected
woman
can
feel
like
other
women
and
is
as
good
a
hand
at
a
as
myself
but
mrs
pemberton
did
not
long
give
way
to
so
violent
an
indulgence
of
her
feelings
and
gently
withdrawing
herself
from
mrs
mowbray
embrace
she
turned
to
the
window
while
mrs
mowbray
hastened
to
the
of
adeline
mrs
pemberton
then
turned
round
again
and
seizing
dr
norberry
hand
which
she
fervently
pressed
said
in
a
faltering
voice
thou
couldst
her
and
i
ca
i
replied
he
gulping
mrs
pemberton
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
which
he
could
neither
mistake
nor
endure
but
muttering
in
a
low
tone
dear
sweet
soul
i
doubt
i
ca
i
doubt
i
ca
by
the
lord
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
from
that
moment
he
never
was
easy
but
when
he
could
converse
with
mrs
pemberton
for
he
knew
that
she
and
she
only
sympathized
in
his
feelings
as
she
only
knew
that
adeline
was
not
likely
to
recover
the
invalid
herself
observed
his
attention
to
her
friend
nor
could
she
forbear
to
rally
him
on
the
total
disappearance
of
his
prejudices
against
the
fair
quaker
for
such
was
the
influence
of
mrs
dignified
yet
winning
manners
and
such
was
the
respect
with
which
she
inspired
him
that
if
he
had
his
hat
on
he
always
took
it
off
when
she
entered
the
room
and
never
uttered
any
thing
like
an
oath
without
humbly
begging
her
pardon
and
he
told
adeline
that
were
all
quakers
like
mrs
pemberton
he
should
be
tempted
to
cry
is
your
only
wear
another
and
another
day
elapsed
and
adeline
still
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
as
she
lay
with
her
head
on
savanna
arm
and
mrs
mowbray
lulling
editha
to
sleep
on
her
lap
was
watching
beside
her
glancing
her
eye
alternately
with
satisfied
and
silent
affection
from
the
child
to
the
mother
whom
she
thought
in
a
fair
way
of
recovery
while
dr
norberry
stifling
an
occasional
sob
was
contemplating
the
group
and
mrs
pemberton
her
hands
clasped
in
each
other
seemed
lost
in
devout
contemplation
adeline
awoke
and
as
she
gazed
on
editha
who
was
fondly
held
to
mrs
mowbray
bosom
a
smile
illumined
her
sunk
countenance
mrs
mowbray
at
that
moment
eagerly
and
anxiously
pressed
forward
to
catch
her
weak
accents
and
inquire
how
she
felt
have
seen
that
fond
and
anxious
look
before
she
faintly
articulated
in
happier
times
and
it
assures
me
that
you
love
me
still
you
still
replied
mrs
mowbray
with
passionate
fondness
never
were
you
so
dear
to
me
as
now
adeline
tried
to
express
the
joy
which
flushed
her
cheek
at
these
words
and
lighted
up
her
closing
eyes
but
she
tried
in
vain
at
length
she
grasped
mrs
mowbray
hand
to
her
lips
and
in
imperfect
accents
exclaiming
thank
thee
blessed
lord
she
laid
her
head
on
bosom
