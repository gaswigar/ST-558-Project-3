thou

here
present
you
with
a
translation
of
the
work
of
an
ancient
who
having
the
happiness
of
living
free
from
all
avocations
thought
proper
by
way
of
amusement
to
write
the
history
of
a
performance
that
comprehends
in
it
more
instruction
than
is
possible
you
may
at
first
be
aware
of
i
beg
you
would
indulge
me
so
far
as
to
read
it
over
and
then
pass
your
impartial
judgment
upon
it
for
notwithstanding
you
are
in
the
bloom
of
your
life
tho
pleasure
courts
you
tho
you
are
nature
darling
and
have
internal
qualities
in
proportion
to
your
beauty
tho
the
world
resounds
your
praises
from
morning
till
night
and
consequently
you
must
have
a
just
title
to
a
superior
degree
of
understanding
than
the
rest
of
your
sex
yet
your
wit
is
no
ways
flashy
your
taste
is
refin
and
i
have
had
the
honour
to
hear
you
talk
more
learnedly
than
the
wisest
with
his
venerable
beard
and
pointed
bonnet
you
are
discreet
and
yet
not
mistrustful
you
are
easy
but
not
weak
you
are
beneficent
with
discretion
you
love
your
friends
and
create
yourself
no
enemies
your
most
sprightly
flights
borrow
no
graces
from
detraction
you
never
speak
a
misbecoming
word
nor
do
an
action
tho
is
always
in
your
power
in
a
word
your
soul
is
as
spotless
as
your
person
you
have
moreover
a
little
fund
of
philosophy
which
gives
me
just
grounds
to
hope
that
you
relish
this
historical
performance
better
than
any
other
lady
of
your
quality
would
do
it
was
originally
compos
in
the
language
to
which
both
you
and
my
self
are
perfect
strangers
it
was
translated
however
into
for
the
amusement
of
the
celebrated
sultan
it
first
appear
in
public
when
the
and
tales
of
one
thousand
and
one
nights
and
one
thousand
and
one
days
were
most
in
vogue
ouloug
chose
rather
to
entertain
himself
with
the
adventures
of
the
sultanas
indeed
were
more
fond
of
the
former
how
can
you
said
the
judicious
ouloug
be
so
partial
as
to
prefer
a
set
of
tales
that
are
no
ways
interesting
or
instructive
to
a
work
that
has
a
variety
of
beauties
to
recommend
it
oh
replied
the
sultanas
the
less
sense
there
is
in
them
the
more
they
are
in
taste
and
the
less
their
merit
the
greater
their
commendation
i
flatter
my
self
thou
patroness
of
wisdom
that
thou
wilt
not
copy
after
those
thoughtless
sultanas
but
give
into
the
sentiments
of
ouloug
i
am
in
hopes
likewise
when
you
are
tir
with
the
conversation
of
such
as
make
those
senseless
romances
their
favourite
amusements
you
will
vouchsafe
to
listen
for
one
minute
or
two
to
the
dictates
of
solid
sense
had
you
been
in
the
days
of
the
son
of
had
you
been
the
queen
of
in
the
reign
of
those
kings
would
have

the
celestial
virtues

riddles
or
an
oriental
history
chap
i
eye
in
the
reign
of
king
there
was
a
young
man
a
native
of
by
name
who
was
not
only
endowed
by
nature
with
an
uncommon
genius
but
born
of
illustrious
parents
who
bestowed
on
him
an
education
no
ways
inferior
to
his
birth
tho
rich
and
young
he
knew
how
to
give
a
check
to
his
passions
he
was
no
ways
he
did
always
act
up
to
the
strictest
rules
of
reason
himself
and
knew
how
to
look
on
the
foibles
of
others
with
an
eye
of
indulgence
every
one
was
surpriz
to
find
that
notwithstanding
he
had
such
a
fund
of
wit
he
never
insulted
nay
never
so
much
as
rallied
any
of
his
companions
for
that
tittle
tattle
which
was
so
vague
and
empty
so
noisy
and
confus
for
those
rash
reflections
those
illiterate
conclusions
and
those
insipid
jokes
and
in
short
for
that
flow
of
unmeaning
words
which
was
call
polite
conversation
in
he
had
learned
from
the
first
book
of
that
is
like
a
bladder
full
blown
which
when
once
prick
discharges
a
kind
of
petty
tempest
in
particular
never
boasted
of
his
contempt
of
the
fair
sex
or
of
his
facility
to
make
conquests
amongst
them
he
was
of
a
generous
spirit
insomuch
that
he
was
not
afraid
of
obliging
even
an
ungrateful
man
strictly
adhering
to
that
wise
maxim
of
you
are
eating
throw
an
offal
to
the
dogs
that
are
under
the
table
lest
they
should
be
tempted
to
bite
he
was
as
wise
as
he
could
well
be
wish
since
he
was
fond
of
no
company
but
such
as
were
distinguish
for
men
of
sense
as
he
was
in
all
the
sciences
of
the
antient
he
was
no
stranger
to
those
principles
of
natural
philosophy
which
were
then
known
and
understood
as
much
of
metaphysics
as
any
one
in
all
ages
after
him
that
is
to
say
he
knew
little
or
nothing
of
the
matter
he
was
firmly
convinc
that
the
year
consisted
of
days
and
an
half
tho
directly
repugnant
to
the
new
philosophy
of
the
age
he
liv
in
and
that
the
sun
was
situated
in
the
center
of
the
earth
and
when
the
chief
magi
told
him
with
an
imperious
air
that
he
maintain
erroneous
principles
and
that
it
was
an
indignity
offered
to
the
government
under
which
he
liv
to
imagine
the
sun
should
roll
round
its
own
axis
and
that
the
year
consisted
of
twelve
months
he
knew
how
to
sit
still
and
quiet
without
shewing
the
least
tokens
of
resentment
or
contempt
as
was
immensely
rich
and
had
consequently
friends
without
number
and
as
he
was
a
gentleman
of
a
robust
constitution
and
remarkably
handsome
as
he
was
endowed
with
a
plentiful
share
of
ready
and
inoffensive
wit
and
in
a
word
as
his
heart
was
perfectly
sincere
and
open
he
imagin
himself
in
some
measure
qualified
to
be
perfectly
happy
for
which
purpose
he
determin
to
marry
a
gay
young
lady
one
by
name
whose
beauty
birth
and
fortune
render
her
the
most
desirable
person
in
all
he
had
a
sincere
affection
for
her
grounded
on
honour
and
conceiv
as
tender
a
passion
for
him
they
were
just
upon
the
critical
minute
of
a
mutual
conjunction
in
the
bands
of
matrimony
when
as
they
were
walking
hand
in
hand
together
towards
one
of
the
gates
of
under
the
shade
of
a
row
of
that
grew
on
the
banks
of
the
river
they
were
beset
by
a
band
of
ruffians
arm
with
sabres
bows
and
arrows
they
were
the
guards
it
seems
of
young
nephew
of
a
certain
minister
of
state
whom
the
parasites
kept
by
his
uncle
had
buoy
up
with
a
permission
to
do
with
impunity
whatever
he
thought
proper
this
young
rival
tho
he
had
none
of
those
internal
qualities
to
boast
of
that
had
yet
he
imagin
himself
a
man
of
more
power
and
for
that
reason
was
perfectly
outrageous
to
see
the
other
preferr
before
him
this
fit
of
jealousy
the
result
of
mere
vanity
prompted
him
to
think
that
he
was
deeply
in
love
with
the
fair
and
fir
with
that
amorous
notion
he
was
determin
to
take
her
away
from
by
dint
of
arms
the
ravishers
rush
rudely
upon
her
and
in
the
transport
of
their
rage
drew
the
blood
of
a
beauty
the
sight
of
whose
charms
would
have
soften
the
very
tigers
of
mount
the
injur
lady
rent
the
very
heavens
with
her
exclamations
where
my
dear
husband
she
cried
they
have
torn
me
from
the
arms
of
the
only
man
whom
i
adore
she
never
reflected
on
the
danger
to
which
she
was
expos
her
sole
concern
was
for
her
beloved
at
the
same
time
he
defended
her
like
a
lover
and
a
man
of
integrity
and
courage
with
the
assistance
only
of
two
domestic
servants
he
put
those
sons
of
violence
to
flight
and
conducted
bloody
as
she
was
and
in
fainting
fits
to
her
own
house
no
sooner
was
she
come
to
her
self
but
she
fix
her
lovely
eyes
on
her
dear
deliverer
o
said
she
i
love
thee
as
affectionately
as
if
i
were
actually
thy
bride
i
love
thee
as
the
man
to
whom
i
owe
my
life
and
what
is
dearer
to
me
the
preservation
of
my
honour
no
heart
sure
could
be
more
deeply
smitten
than
that
of
never
did
the
lips
of
the
fairest
creature
living
utter
softer
sounds
never
did
the
most
enamoured
lady
breathe
such
tender
sentiments
of
love
and
gratitude
for
his
signal
service
never
in
short
did
the
most
affectionate
bride
express
such
transports
of
joy
for
the
fondest
husband
her
wounds
however
were
but
very
superficial
and
she
was
soon
recover
receiv
a
wound
that
was
much
more
dangerous
an
unlucky
arrow
had
graz
one
of
his
eyes
and
the
orifice
was
deep
was
incessant
in
her
prayers
to
the
gods
that
they
might
restore
her
her
eyes
were
night
and
day
overwhelm
with
tears
she
waited
with
impatience
for
the
happy
moment
when
those
of
might
dart
their
fires
upon
her
but
alas
the
wounded
eye
grew
so
inflam
and
swell
that
she
was
terrified
to
the
last
degree
she
sent
as
far
as
for
the
celebrated
physician
there
who
instantly
attended
his
new
patient
with
a
numerous
retinue
upon
his
first
visit
he
peremptorily
declared
that
would
lose
his
eye
and
foretold
not
only
the
day
but
the
very
hour
when
that
woful
disaster
would
befal
him
had
it
been
said
that
great
man
his
right
eye
i
could
have
administred
an
infallible
specific
but
as
it
is
his
misfortune
is
beyond
the
art
of
man
to
cure
tho
all
pitied
the
hard
case
of
they
equally
stood
astonish
at
the
profound
penetration
of
two
days
after
the
imposthume
broke
without
any
application
and
soon
after
was
perfectly
recover
thereupon
wrote
a
very
long
and
elaborate
treatise
to
prove
that
his
wound
ought
not
to
have
been
heal
however
never
thought
it
worth
his
while
to
peruse
his
learned
lucubrations
but
as
soon
as
ever
he
could
get
abroad
determin
to
pay
the
lady
a
visit
who
had
testified
such
uncommon
concern
for
his
welfare
and
for
whose
sake
alone
he
wish
for
the
restoration
of
his
sight
he
found
had
been
out
of
town
for
three
days
but
was
inform
by
the
bye
that
his
intended
spouse
having
conceived
an
implacable
aversion
to
a
man
was
that
very
night
to
be
married
to
at
this
unexpected
ill
news
poor
was
perfectly
he
laid
his
disappointment
so
far
to
heart
that
in
a
short
time
he
was
become
a
mere
skeleton
and
was
sick
almost
to
death
for
some
months
afterwards
at
last
however
by
dint
of
reflection
he
got
the
better
of
his
distemper
and
the
acuteness
of
the
pain
he
underwent
in
some
measure
contributed
towards
his
consolation
since
i
have
met
with
such
an
unexpected
repulse
said
he
from
a
capricious
i
am
determin
to
marry
some
substantial
citizen
daughter
he
pitch
accordingly
upon
a
young
gentlewoman
extremely
an
excellent
oeconomist
and
one
whose
parents
were
very
rich
their
nuptials
accordingly
were
soon
after
solemniz
and
for
a
whole
month
successively
no
two
turtles
were
ever
more
fond
of
each
other
in
process
of
time
however
he
perceiv
she
was
a
little
coquettish
and
too
much
inclin
to
think
that
the
handsomest
young
fellows
were
always
the
most
virtuous
and
the
greatest
wits
chap
ii
nose
one
day
as
she
was
just
return
home
from
taking
a
short
country
airing
threw
herself
into
a
violent
passion
and
with
invectives
what
in
god
name
my
dear
said
has
thus
ruffled
your
temper
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
all
these
warm
exclamations
alas
said
she
you
would
have
been
disgusted
as
much
as
i
am
had
you
been
an
of
that
scene
of
female
falshood
as
i
was
yesterday
i
went
you
must
know
to
visit
the
disconsolate
widow
who
has
been
these
two
days
erecting
a
monument
to
the
memory
of
her
young
deceased
husband
near
the
brook
that
runs
on
one
side
of
her
meadow
she
made
the
most
solemn
vow
in
the
height
of
her
affliction
never
to
stir
from
that
tomb
as
long
as
ever
that
rivulet
took
its
usual
well
and
wherein
pray
said
is
the
good
woman
so
much
to
blame
is
it
not
an
incontestable
mark
of
her
superior
merit
and
but
said
was
you
to
know
how
her
thoughts
were
employ
when
i
made
my
visit
you
never
forget
or
forgive
her
pray
my
dearest
what
then
was
she
about
why
the
creature
said
was
studying
to
be
sure
to
find
out
ways
and
means
to
turn
the
current
of
the
river
in
short
harangu
so
long
and
was
so
big
with
her
invectives
against
the
young
widow
that
her
too
affected
vain
shew
of
virtue
gave
a
secret
disgust
had
an
intimate
friend
one
by
name
whose
spouse
was
perfectly
honest
and
had
in
reality
a
greater
regard
for
him
than
all
mankind
besides
this
friend
made
his
confident
and
bound
him
to
keep
a
project
of
his
entirely
a
secret
by
a
promise
of
some
valuable
token
of
his
respect
had
been
visiting
a
female
companion
for
two
days
together
in
the
country
and
on
the
third
was
returning
home
no
sooner
however
was
she
in
sight
of
the
house
but
the
servants
ran
to
meet
her
with
tears
in
their
eyes
and
told
her
that
their
master
dy
suddenly
the
night
before
that
they
durst
carry
her
the
doleful
tidings
but
were
going
to
bury
in
the
sepulchre
of
his
ancestors
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
she
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
tore
her
hair
and
vow
to
die
by
his
side
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
young
came
and
begg
the
favour
of
being
introduc
to
the
widow
he
was
so
and
they
wept
together
very
cordially
next
day
the
storm
was
somewhat
abated
and
they
din
together
inform
her
that
his
friend
had
left
him
the
much
greater
part
of
his
effects
and
gave
her
to
understand
that
he
should
think
himself
the
happiest
creature
in
the
world
if
she
would
condescend
to
be
his
partner
in
that
demise
the
widow
wept
sobb
and
began
to
melt
more
time
was
spent
in
supper
than
at
dinner
they
discoursed
together
with
a
little
more
freedom
was
lavish
of
her
encomiums
on
but
then
was
true
she
said
he
had
some
secret
infirmities
to
which
was
a
stranger
in
the
midst
of
their
midnight
entertainment

on
a
sudden
complain
that
he
was
taken
with
a
most
violent
pleuretic
fit
and
was
ready
to
swoon
away
our
lady
being
extremely
concern
and
flew
to
her
closet
of
cordials
and
brought
down
every
thing
she
could
think
of
that
might
be
of
service
on
this
emergent
occasion
she
was
extremely
sorry
that
the
famous
was
gone
from
and
condescended
to
lay
her
warm
hand
upon
the
part
affected
in
which
he
felt
such
an
agonizing
pain
pray
sir
said
she
in
a
soft
languishing
tone
are
you
subject
to
this
tormenting
malady
sometimes
madam
said
so
strong
that
they
bring
me
almost
to
death
door
and
there
is
but
one
thing
can
infallibly
cure
me
and
that
is
the
application
of
a
dead
nose
to
the
part
affected
an
odd
remedy
truly
said
not
stranger
madam
said
he
than
the
great
infallible
apoplectic
necklaces
there
was
at
this
time
in
a
famous
doctor
nam
who
both
cur
apoplectic
fits
and
prevented
them
from
affecting
his
patients
as
was
frequently
advertiz
in
the
gazettes
by
a
little
purse
that
he
hung
round
their
necks
this
assurance
of
success
together
with
personal
merit
determin
in
his
favour
after
all
said
she
when
my
husband
shall
be
about
to
cross
the
bridge
from
this
world
of
yesterday
to
the
other
of

the
angel
think
you
make
any
scruple
about
his
passage
should
his
nose
prove
something
shorter
in
the
next
life
than
was
in
this
she
would
venture
however
and
taking
up
a
sharp
razor
repair
to
her
husband
tomb
water
it
first
with
her
tears
and
then
intended
to
perform
the
innocent
operation
as
he
lay
extended
breathless
as
she
thought
in
his
coffin
mounted
in
a
moment
secur
his
nose
with
one
hand
and
the
with
the
other
madam
said
he
never
more

against
the
widow
the
scheme
for
cutting
my

off

much
closer
laid

found
by
experience
that
the
first
thirty
days
of
matrimony
as
is
written
in
the
book
of

but
the
second
is
all
wormwood
he
was
oblig
in
short
as
grew
such
a
termagant
to
sue
out
a
bill
of
divorce
and
to
seek
his
consolation
for
the
future
in
the
study
of
nature
who
is
happier
said
he
than
the
philosopher
who
peruses
with
understanding
that
spacious
book
which
the
supreme
being
has
laid
open
before
his
eyes
the
truths
he
discovers
there

infinite

thereby
cultivates
and
improves
his

he
lives
in
peace
and
tranquility
all

is
afraid
of

he
has
no

him
wrapped
up
in
these
contemplations
he
retir
to
a
little
country
house
on

he
never
spent
his
time
in
calculating
how
many
inches
of
water
run
thro
the
arch
of
a
bridge
in
a
second
of
time
or
in
enquiring
if

of

falls
more
in

he
pry
into
the
nature
and
properties
of
animals
and
plants
and
soon
by
his
strict
and
repeated
enquiries
he
was
capable
of
discerning
a
thousand
variations
in
visible
objects
that
others
less
curious
imagin
were
all
alike
one
day
as
he
was
taking
a
solitary
walk
by
the
side
of
a
thicket
he
espy
one
of
the
queen
eunuchs
with
several
of
his
attendants
coming
towards
him
hunting
about
in
deep
concern
both
here
and
there
like
persons
almost
in
despair
and
seeking
with
impatience
for
something
lost
of
the
utmost
importance
young
man
said
the
queen
chief
eunuch
have
not
you
seen
pray
her
majesty
dog
very
cooly
replied
you
mean
her
bitch
i
presume
you
say
very
right
sir
said
the
eunuch
is
a
and
very
small
said
she
has
had
puppies
too
lately
she
a
little
lame
with
her
left
and
has
long
ears
by
your
exact
description
sir
you
must
doubtless
have
seen
her
said
the
eunuch
almost
out
of
breath
but
i
have
not
sir
notwithstanding
neither
did
i
know
but
by
you
that
the
queen
ever
had
such
a
favourite
bitch
just
at
this
critical
juncture
so
various
are
the
turns
of
fortune
wheel
the
best
palfrey
in
all
the
king
stable
had
broke
loose
from
the
groom
and
got
upon
the
plains
of
the
head
huntsman
with
all
his
inferior
officers
were
in
pursuit
after
him
with
as
much
concern
as
the
eunuch
about
the
bitch
the
head
huntsman
address
himself
to
and
ask
him
whether
he
had
seen
the
king
palfrey
run
by
him
no
horse
said
ever
gallop
smoother
he
is
about
five
foot
high
his
hoofs
are
very
small
his
tail
is
about
three
foot
six
inches
long
the
studs
of
his
bit
are
of
pure
gold
about
carats
and
his
shoes
are
of
silver
about
eleven
penny
weight
what
course
did
he
take
pray
sir
whereabouts
is
he
said
the
huntsman
i
never
sat
eyes
on
him
reply
not
i
neither
did
i
ever
hear
before
now
that
his
majesty
had
such
a
palfrey
the
head
huntsman
as
well
as
the
head
eunuch
upon
his
answering
their
interrogatories
so
very
exactly
not
doubting
in
the
least
but
that
had
clandestinely
convey
both
the
bitch
and
the
horse
away
secur
him
and
carried
him
before
the
grand
desterham
who
condemn
him
to
the
and
to
be
confin
for
life
in
some
remote
and
lonely
part
of
no
sooner
had
the
sentence
been
pronounc
but
the
horse
and
bitch
were
both
found
the
judges
were
in
some
perplexity
in
this
odd
affair
and
yet
thought
it
absolutely
necessary
as
the
man
was
innocent
to
recal
their
decree
however
they
laid
a
fine
upon
him
of
four
hundred
ounces
of
gold
for
his
false
declaration
of
his
not
having
seen
what
doubtless
he
did
and
the
fine
was
order
to
be
deposited
in
court
accordingly
on
the
payment
whereof
he
was
permitted
to
bring
his
cause
on
to
a
hearing
before
the
grand
desterham
on
the
day
appointed
for
that
purpose
he
open
the
cause
himself
in
terms
to
this
or
the
like
effect
ye
bright
stars
of
justice
ye
profound
abyss
of
universal
knowledge
ye
mirrors
of
equity
who
have
in
you
the
solidity
of
lead
the
hardness
of
steel
the
lustre
of
a
diamond
and
the
resemblance
of
the
purest
gold
since
ye
have
condescended
so
far
as
to
admit
of
my
address
to
this
august
assembly
i
here
in
the
most
solemn
manner
swear
to
you
by
that
i
never
saw
the
queen
illustrious
bitch
nor
the
sacred
palfrey
of
the
king
of
kings
i
be
ingenuous
however
and
declare
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
as
i
was
walking
by
the
thicket
side
where
i
met
with
her
majesty
most
venerable
chief
eunuch
and
the
most
illustrious
chief
huntsman
i
perceiv
upon
the
sand
the
footsteps
of
an
animal
and
i
easily
inferr
that
it
must
be
a
little
one
the
several
small
tho
long
ridges
of
land
between
the
footsteps
of
the
creature
gave
me
just
grounds
to
imagine
it
was
a
bitch
whose
teats
hung
down
and
for
that
reason
i
concluded
she
had
but
lately
pupp
as
i
observ
likewise
some
other
traces
in
some
degree
different
which
seem
to
have
graz
all
the
way
upon
the
surface
of
the
sand
on
the
side
of
the
i
knew
well
enough
she
must
have
had
long
ears
and
forasmuch
as
i
discern
with
some
degree
of
curiosity
that
the
sand
was
every
where
less
hollow
by
one
foot
in
particular
than
by
the
other
three
i
conceiv
that
the
bitch
of
our
most
august
queen
was
somewhat
lamish
if
i
may
presume
to
say
so
as
to
the
palfrey
of
the
king
of
kings
give
me
leave
to
inform
you
that
as
i
was
walking
down
the
lane
by
the
i
took
particular
notice
of
the
prints
made
upon
the
sand
by
a
shoes
and
found
that
their
distances
were
in
exact
proportion
from
that
observation
i
concluded
the
palfrey
gallop
well
in
the
next
place
the
dust
of
some
trees
in
a
narrow
lane
which
was
but
seven
foot
broad
was
here
and
there
swept
off
both
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
about
three
feet
and
six
inches
from
the
middle
of
the
road
for
which
reason
i
pronounc
the
tail
of
the
palfrey
to
be
three
foot
and
a
half
long
with
which
he
had
whisk
off
the
dust
on
both
sides
as
he
ran
along
again
i
perceiv
under
the
trees
which
form
a
kind
of
bower
of
five
feet
high
some
leaves
that
had
been
lately
fallen
on
the
ground
and
i
was
sensible
the
horse
must
have
shook
them
off
from
whence
i
conjectur
he
was
five
foot
high
as
to
the
bits
of
his
bridle
i
knew
they
must
be
of
gold
and
of
the
value
i
mention
for
he
had
rubb
the
studs
upon
a
certain
stone
which
i
knew
to
be
a
by
an
experiment
that
i
had
made
of
it
to
conclude
by
the
prints
which
his
shoes
had
left
of
some
of
another
nature
i
concluded
his
shoes
were
silver
and
of
eleven
penny
weight
fineness
as
i
before
mention
the
whole
bench
of
judges
stood
astonish
at
the
profundity
of
nice
discernment
the
news
was
soon
carried
to
the
king
and
the
queen
was
not
only
the
whole
subject
of
the
conversation
but
his
name
was
mention
with
the
utmost
veneration
in
the
king
chambers
and
his
and
notwithstanding
several
of
their
magi
declar
he
ought
to
be
burnt
for
a
sorcerer
yet
the
king
thought
proper
that
the
fine
he
had
deposited
in
court
should
be
peremptorily
restor
the
clerk
of
the
court
the
tipstaffs
and
other
petty
officers
waited
on
him
in
their
proper
habit
in
order
to
refund
the
four
hundred
ounces
of
gold
pursuant
to
the
king
express
order
modestly
reserving
only
three
hundred
and
ninety
ounces
part
thereof
to
defray
the
fees
of
the
court
and
the
domesticks
swarm
about
him
likewise
in
hopes
of
some
small
consideration
upon
winding
up
of
the
bottom
was
fully
convinc
that
it
was
very
dangerous
to
be
and
was
determin
to
set
a
watch
before
the
door
of
his
lips
for
the
future
an
opportunity
soon
offer
for
the
trial
of
his
resolution
a
prisoner
of
state
had
just
made
his
escape
and
pass
under
the
window
of
house
was
examin
thereupon
but
was
absolutely
dumb
however
as
it
was
plainly
prov
upon
him
that
he
did
look
out
of
the
window
at
the
same
time
he
was
sentenc
to
pay
five
hundred
ounces
of
gold
for
that
misdemeanor
and
moreover
was
oblig
to
thank
the
court
for
their
indulgence
a
compliment
which
the
magistrates
of
expect
to
be
paid
them
good
god
said
he
to
himself
have
i
not
substantial
reason
to
complain
that
my
impropitious
stars
should
direct
me
to
walk
by
a
where
the
queen
bitch
and
the
king
palfrey
should
happen
to
pass
by
how
dangerous
is
it
to
pop
one
head
out
of
one
window
and
in
a
word
how
difficult
is
it
for
a
man
to
be
happy
on
this
side
the
grave
chap
iv
envious
man
as
had
met
with
such
a
series
of
misfortunes
he
was
determin
to
ease
the
weight
of
them
by
the
study
of
philosophy
and
the
conversation
of
select
friends
he
was
still
possess
of
a
little
pretty
box
in
the
of
which
was
in
a
good
taste
where
every
artist
was
welcome
and
wherein
he
enjoy
all
the
rational
pleasures
that
a
virtuous
man
could
well
wish
for
in
the
morning
his
library
was
always
open
for
the
use
of
the
learned
at
night
his
table
was
fill
with
the
most
agreeable
companions
but
he
was
soon
sensible
by
experience
how
dangerous
it
was
to
keep
learned
men
company
a
warm
dispute
arose
about
a
certain
law
of
which
prohibited
the
eating
of
griffins
but
to
what
purpose
said
some
of
the
company
was
that
prohibition
since
there
is
no
such
animal
in
nature
some
again
insisted
that
there
must
for
otherwise
could
never
have
been
so
weak
as
to
give
his
pupils
such
a
caution
in
order
to
compromize
the
matter
said
gentlemen
if
there
are
such
creatures
in
being
let
us
never
touch
them
and
if
there
are
not
we
are
well
assur
we
ca
touch
them
so
in
either
case
we
shall
comply
with
the
commandment
a
learned
man
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
who
had
thirteen
volumes
expatiating
on
every
property
of
the
griffin
took
this
affair
in
a
very
serious
light
which
would
greatly
have
embarrass
but
for
the
credit
of
a
magus
who
was
brother
to
his
friend
from
that
day
forward
ever
distinguish
and
preferr
good
before
learned
company
he
associated
with
the
most
conversible
men
and
the
most
amiable
ladies
in
all
he
made
elegant
entertainments
which
were
frequently
preceded
by
a
concert
of
musick
and
enliven
by
the
most
facetious
conversation
in
which
as
he
had
felt
the
smart
of
it
he
had
laid
aside
all
thoughts
of
shewing
his
wit
which
is
not
only
the
surest
proof
that
a
man
has
none
but
the
most
infallible
means
to
spoil
all
good
company
neither
the
choice
of
his
friends
nor
that
of
his
dishes
was
the
result
of
pride
or
ostentation
he
took
delight
in
appearing
to
be
what
he
actually
was
and
not
in
seeming
to
be
what
he
was
not
and
by
that
means
got
a
greater
real
character
than
he
actually
at
directly
opposite
to
his
house
liv
one
puff
up
with
pride
who
not
meeting
with
success
in
the
world
sought
his
revenge
in
railing
against
all
mankind
rich
as
he
was
it
was
almost
more
than
he
could
accomplish
to
procure
any
parasites
about
him
tho
the
rattling
of
the
chariots
which
stopp
at
door
was
a
perfect
nuisance
to
him
yet
the
good
character
which
every
body
gave
him
was
still
a
higher
provocation
he
would
sometimes
intrude
himself
upon
and
set
down
at
his
table
without
any
invitation
when
there
he
would
most
certainly
interrupt
the
mirth
of
the
company
as
harpies
they
say
infect
the
very
carrion
that
they
eat
took
it
in
his
head
one
day
to
invite
a
young
lady
to
an
entertainment
but
she
instead
of
accepting
of
his
offer
spent
the
evening
at
another
time
as
and
he
were
chatting
together
at
court
a
minister
of
state
came
up
to
them
and
invited
to
supper
but
took
no
notice
of
the
most
implacable
aversions
have
frequently
no
better
foundations
this
gentleman
who
was
call
the
would
have
taken
away
the
life
of
if
he
could
because
most
people
him
by
the
title
of
the
an
opportunity
of
doing
mischief
says
offers
itself
a
hundred
times
a
day
but
that
of
doing
a
friend
a
good
office
but
once
a
year
went
one
day
to
house
when
he
was
walking
in
his
garden
with
two
friends
and
a
young
lady
to
whom
he
said
abundance
of
fine
things
with
no
other
design
but
the
innocent
pleasure
of
saying
them
their
conversation
turn
on
a
war
that
the
king
had
happily
put
an
end
to
between
him
and
his
vassal
the
prince
of
having
signaliz
himself
in
that
short
war
commended
his
majesty
very
highly
but
was
more
lavish
of
his
compliments
on
the
lady
he
took
out
his
pocket
book
and
wrote
four
extempore
verses
on
that
occasion
and
gave
them
the
lady
to
read
the
gentlemen
then
present
begg
to
be
oblig
with
a
sight
of
them
as
well
as
the
lady
but
either
thro
modesty
or
rather
a
that
he
had
happily
succeeded
he
gave
them
a
flat
denial
he
was
sensible
that
a
sudden
poetic
flight
must
prove
insipid
to
every
one
but
the
person
in
whose
favour
it
is
written
whereupon
he
snapt
the
table
in
two
whereon
the
lines
were
wrote
and
threw
both
pieces
into
a
where
they
were
hunted
for
but
to
no
purpose
soon
after
it
happened
to
rain
and
all
the
company
flew
into
the
house
but
notwithstanding
the
shower
he
continued
in
the
garden
and
never
quitted
it
till
he
had
found
one
moiety
of
the
tablet
which
was
unfortunately
broke
in
such
a
manner
that
even
the
half
lines
were
good
sense
and
good
metre
tho
very
short
but
what
was
still
more
remarkably
unfortunate
they
appear
at
first
view
to
be
a
severe
satyr
upon
the
king
the
words
were
these
flagrant
crimes
his
crown
he
owes
to
peaceful
times
the
worst
of
this
was
the
first
moment
that
ever
was
happy
he
had
it
now
in
his
power
to
ruin
the
most
virtuous
and
innocent
of
men
big
with
his
execrable
joy
he
flew
to
his
majesty
with
this
virulent
satyr
of
under
his
own
hand
not
only
but
his
two
friends
and
the
lady
were
immediately
close
confin
his
cause
was
soon
over
for
the
judges
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
what
he
had
to
say
when
sentence
of
condemnation
was
pass
upon
him
still
spiteful
was
heard
to
say
as
he
went
out
of
court
with
an
air
of
contempt
that
lines
were
treason
indeed
but
nothing
more
tho
did
value
himself
on
account
of
his
genius
for
poetry
yet
he
was
almost
distracted
to
find
himself
condemn
for
the
worst
of
traitors
and
his
two
friends
and
the
lady
lock
up
in
a
dungeon
for
a
crime
of
which
he
was
no
ways
guilty
he
permitted
to
speak
one
word
for
himself
his
was
sufficient
evidence
against
him
so
strict
were
the
laws
of
he
was
carried
to
the
place
of
execution
through
a
croud
of
spectators
who
durst
condole
with
him
and
who
flock
about
him
to
observe
whether
his
countenance
chang
or
whether
he
died
with
a
good
grace
his
relations
were
the
only
real
mourners
for
there
was
no
estate
in
reversion
for
them
three
parts
of
his
effects
were
confiscated
for
the
king
use
and
the
fourth
was
devoted
as
a
reward
to
the
use
of
the
informer
just
at
the
time
that
he
was
preparing
himself
for
death
the
parrot
flew
from
her
balcony
into
garden
and
alighted
on
a
a
peach
that
had
been
blown
down
and
drove
by
the
wind
from
an
adjacent
tree
just
under
the
bush
was
glew
as
it
were
to
the
other
moiety
of
the
tablet
away
flew
the
parrot
with
her
booty
and
return
to
the
king
lap
the
monarch
being
somewhat
curious
read
the
words
on
the
broken
tablet
which
had
no
meaning
in
them
as
he
could
perceive
but
seem
to
be
the
broken
parts
of
a
tetrastick
he
was
a
great
admirer
of
poetry
and
the
odd
adventure
of
his
parrot
put
him
upon
reflection
the
queen
who
recollected
full
well
the
lines
that
were
wrote
on
the
fragment
of
tablet
order
that
part
of
it
to
be
produc
both
the
broken
pieces
being
put
together
they
answered
exactly
the
indentures
and
then
the
verses
which
had
written
in
a
flight
of
loyalty
ran
thus
are
prone
to
flagrant
crimes
to
clemency
his
crown
he
owes
to
concord
and
to
peaceful
times
love
only
is
the
worst
of
upon
this
the
king
order
to
be
instantly
brought
before
him
and
his
two
friends
and
the
lady
to
be
that
moment
discharg
as
he
stood
before
the
king
and
queen
fix
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
and
begg
their
majesty
pardon
for
his
little
worthless
poetical
attempt
he
spoke
however
with
such
a
becoming
grace
and
with
so
much
modesty
and
good
sense
that
the
king
and
the
queen
ordered
him
to
be
brought
before
them
once
again
he
was
brought
accordingly
and
he
pleas
them
still
more
and
more
in
short
they
gave
him
all
the
immense
estate
of
who
had
so
unjustly
accus
him
but
generously
return
the
wicked
informer
the
whole
to
a
farthing
the
envious
man
however
was
no
ways
affected
but
with
the
restoration
of
his
effects
every
day
grew
more
and
more
in
favour
at
court
he
was
made
a
party
in
all
the
king
pleasures
and
nothing
was
done
in
the
without
him
the
queen
from
that
very
hour
him
so
much
respect
and
spoke
to
him
in
such
soft
and
endearing
terms
that
in
process
of
time
it
prov
of
fatal
consequence
to
herself
her
royal
consort
to
and
the
whole
kingdom
now
began
to
think
it
was
not
so
difficult
a
thing
to
be
happy
as
at
first
he
imagin
chap
force
generosity
the
time
now
drew
near
for
the
celebration
of
a
grand
festival
which
was
kept
but
once
in
five
years
was
a
constant
custom
in
at
the
expiration
of
the
term
to
distinguish
that
citizen
from
all
the
rest
in
the
most
solemn
manner
who
had
done
the
most
generous
action
and
the
grandees
and
magi
always
sat
as
judges
the
inform
them
of
every
deed
that
occurr
within
his
district
all
were
put
to
the
vote
and
the
king
himself
pronounc
the
definitive
sentence
people
of
all
ranks
and
degrees
came
from
the
remotest
part
of
the
kingdom
to
be
present
at
this
solemnity
the
victor
whoever
he
was
receiv
from
the
king
own
hand
a
golden
cup
enrich
with
precious
stones
and
upon
the
delivery
the
king
made
use
of
the
following
salutation
this
reward
of
your
generosity
and
may
the
gods
grant
me
thousands
of
such
valuable
subjects
upon
this
memorable
day
the
king
appear
in
all
the
pomp
imaginable
on
his
throne
of
state
surrounded
by
his
grandees
the
magi
and
the
deputies
from
all
the
surrounding
nations
of
every
province
that
attended
these
public
sports
where
honour
was
to
be
acquir
not
by
the
velocity
of
the
best
or
by
bodily
strength
but
by
intrinsic
merit
the
principal
proclaim
with
an
audible
voice
such
actions
as
would
entitle
the
victor
to
the
inestimable
prize
but
never
mention
one
word
of
greatness
of
soul
in
returning
his
invidious
neighbour
all
his
estate
notwithstanding
he
would
have
taken
away
his
life
that
was
but
a
trifle
and
not
worth
speaking
of
the
first
that
was
set
up
for
the
prize
was
a
judge
that
had
occasion
a
citizen
to
lose
a
very
considerable
cause
through
some
mistake
for
which
he
was
no
ways
responsible
and
made
him
restitution
out
of
his
private
purse
the
next
candidate
was
a
youth
that
tho
violently
in
love
with
one
that
he
intended
shortly
to
make
his
spouse
yet
resign
her
to
his
friend
who
was
just
expiring
at
her
feet
and
moreover
gave
her
a
portion
at
the
same
time
after
this
appear
a
soldier
who
in
the
war
had
done
a
much
more
glorious
action
than
the
lover
a
gang
of
having
taken
his
mistress
from
him
he
fought
them
bravely
and
rescued
her
out
of
their
hands
soon
after
he
was
inform
that
another
band
of
the
same
party
had
hurried
away
his
mother
to
a
place
not
far
distant
he
left
his
mistress
all
drown
in
tears
and
ran
to
his
mother
assistance
after
that
skirmish
was
over
he
returned
to
his
and
found
her
just
expiring
he
would
fain
have
plung
a
dagger
into
his
heart
that
moment
but
his
mother
remonstrated
to
him
that
should
he
die
she
should
be
entirely
helpless
and
upon
that
account
only
he
had
courage
to
live
a
little
longer
the
judges
seem
very
much
inclin
to
give
their
votes
for
the
soldier
but
the
king
prevented
them
by
saying
that
the
action
was
enough
and
so
were
those
of
the
rest
but
none
of
them
give
me
any
surprize
what
did
yesterday
perfectly
struck
me
with
astonishment
i
mention
another
instance
i
had
some
few
days
ago
as
a
testimony
of
my
resentment
banish
my
and
favourite
from
the
court
i
complain
of
his
conduct
in
the
warmest
terms
and
all
my
sycophants
about
me
told
me
that
i
was
too
merciful
and
loaded
him
with
the
sharpest
invectives
i
ask
what
his
opinion
was
of
and
he
dar
to
give
him
the
best
of
characters
i
must
confess
i
have
read
in
our
publick
records
indeed
of
instances
where
restitution
have
been
generally
made
for
injuries
committed
by
mistake
where
a
mistress
has
been
resign
and
where
a
mother
has
been
preferr
to
a
mistress
but
i
never
read
of
a
courtier
that
would
speak
to
the
advantage
of
a
minister
in
disgrace
and
against
whom
the
sovereign
was
highly
incens
i
give
pieces
of
gold
to
every
candidate
that
has
been
this
day
proclaim
but
i
give
the
cup
to
no
one
but
sire
said
is
your
majesty
alone
that
deserves
the
cup
you
alone
who
have
done
an
action
of
generosity
never
heard
of
before
since
you
who
are
king
of
kings
was
exasperated
against
your
slave
when
he
contradicted
you
in
the
heat
of
your
passion
every
body
gaz
with
eyes
of
admiration
on
the
king
and
the
judge
who
had
generously
made
restitution
for
his
error
the
lover
who
had
married
his
mistress
to
his
friend
the
soldier
who
had
preferr
the
welfare
of
his
mother
to
that
of
his
mistress
received
the
promis
donation
from
the
monarch
and
saw
their
names
register
in
the
book
of
but
had
the
cup
the
king
got
the
universal
character
of
a
good
prince
which
he
did
not
long
preserve
this
joyful
day
was
solemniz
with
festivals
beyond
the
time
by
law
establish
tragedies
were
acted
there
that
drew
tears
from
the
spectators
and
comedies
that
made
them
laugh
entertainments
that
the
were
perfect
strangers
to
the
commemoration
of
it
is
still
preserv
in
now
said
i
am
happy
at
last
but
he
was
grosly
mistaken
chap
vi
judgments
young
as
was
he
was
constituted
chief
judge
of
all
the
tribunals
throughout
the
empire
he
fill
the
place
like
one
whom
the
gods
had
endow
with
the
strictest
justice
and
the
most
solid
wisdom
it
was
to
him
the
nations
round
about
were
indebted
for
that
generous
maxim
is
much
more
prudence
to
acquit
two
persons
tho
actually
guilty
than
to
pass
sentence
of
condemnation
in
one
that
is
virtuous
and
it
was
his
firm
opinion
that
the
laws
were
intended
to
be
a
praise
to
those
who
did
well
as
much
as
to
be
a
terror
to
evildoers
it
was
his
peculiar
talent
to
render
truth
as
obvious
as
possible
whereas
most
men
study
to
render
it
intricate
and
obscure
on
the
very
first
day
of
his
entrance
into
his
high
office
he
exerted
this
peculiar
talent
a
rich
merchant
and
a
native
of
died
in
the
he
had
made
his
will
and
appointed
his
two
sons
of
his
estate
as
soon
as
they
had
settled
their
sister
and
married
her
with
their
mutual
approbation
moreover
he
left
a
specific
legacy
of
pieces
of
gold
to
that
son
who
should
after
his
decease
be
prov
to
love
him
best
the
eldest
erected
to
his
memory
a
very
costly
monument
the
youngest
appropriated
a
considerable
part
of
his
bequest
to
the
augmentation
of
his
sister
fortune
every
one
without
hesitation
gave
the
preference
to
the
elder
allowing
the
younger
to
have
the
greatest
affection
for
his
sister
the
legacy
therefore
was
doubtless
due
to
the
eldest
their
cause
came
before
and
he
examin
them
apart
to
the
former
said
your
father
sir
is
not
dead
as
is
reported
but
being
happily
recover
is
on
his
return
to
god

praised
said
the
young
man
but
i
hope
the
expence
i
have
been
at
in
raising
this
superb
monument
will
be
consider
after
this
repeated
the
same
story
to
the
younger
god
be
praised
said
he
i
will
immediately
restore
all
that
he
has
left
me
but
i
hope
my
father
will
not
recal
the
little
present
i
have
made
my
sister
you
have
nothing
to
restore
sir
you
shall
have
the
legacy
of
the
thirty
thousand
pieces
for

the
greatest
veneration
for

young

months

for

child
that

give
him
the
most
liberal
education
in
a
short
time
after
my
lady
was
brought
to
bed
of
a
hopeful
boy
each
of
them
insisted
on
being
tutor
and
the
cause
was
brought
before
the
two
magi
were
order
to
appear
in
court
pray
sir
said
to
the
first
what
method
of
instruction
do
you
propose
to
pursue
for
the
improvement
of
your
young
pupil
he
shall
first
be
grounded
said
this
learned
pedagogue
in
the
eight
parts
of
speech
then
i
teach
him
logic
astrology
magick
the
wide
difference
between
the
terms
substance
and
accident
abstract
and
concrete
c
as
for
my
part
sir
i
shall
take
another
course
said
the
second
i
do
my
utmost
to
make
him
an
honest
man
and
acceptable
to
his
friends
upon
this
said
you
sir
shall
marry
the
mother
let
who
will
be
the
father
there
came
daily
complaints
to
court
against
the
of
whose
name
was
he
was
a
person
of
quality
who
was
possess
of
a
very
considerable
estate
notwithstanding
he
had
squander
away
a
great
part
of
it
by
indulging
himself
in
all
manner
of
expensive
pleasures
it
was
but
seldom
that
an
inferior
was
suffer
to
speak
to
him
but
not
a
soul
durst
contradict
him
no
peacock
was
more
gay
no
turtle
more
amorous
and
no
tortoise
more
indolent
and
inactive
he
made
false
glory
and
false
pleasures
his
sole
pursuit
undertaking
to
cure
him
sent
him
forthwith
as
by
express
order
from
the
king
a
with
twelve
voices
and
violins
as
his
attendants
a
head
steward
with
six
men
cooks
and
chamberlains
who
were
never
to
be
out
of
his
sight
the
king
issued
out
his
writ
for
the
punctual
observance
of
his
royal
will
and
thus
the
affair
proceeded
the
first
morning
as
soon
as
the
voluptuous
had
open
his
eyes
his
with
the
voices
and
violins
entred
his
apartment
they
sang
a
cantata
that
lasted
two
hours
and
three
minutes
every
three
minutes
the
chorus
or
burthen
of
the
song
was
to
this
effect
in
words
to
speak
your
praise
what
mighty
honours
are
your
due
to
worth
like
yours
we
altars
raise
no
monarch
happier
sir
than
after
the
cantata
was
over
the
chamberlain
address
him
in
a
formal
harangue
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
without
ceasing
wherein
he
took
occasion
to
extol
every
virtue
to
which
he
was
a
perfect
stranger
when
the
oration
was
over
he
was
conducted
to
dinner
where
the
musicians
were
all
in
waiting
and
play
as
soon
as
he
was
seated
at
his
table
dinner
lasted
three
hours
before
he
condescended
to
speak
a
word
when
he
did
you
say
right
sir
said
the
chief
chamberlain
scarce
had
he
utter
four
words
more
but
right
sir
said
the
second
the
other
two
chamberlain
time
was
taken
up
in
laughing
with
admiration
at
smart
repartees
or
at
least
such
as
he
ought
to
have
made
after
the
cloth
was
taken
away
the
adulating
chorus
was
repeated
this
first
day
was
all
in
raptures
he
imagin
that
this
honour
done
him
by
the
king
of
kings
was
the
sole
result
of
his
exalted
merit
the
second
was
altogether
so
agreeable
the
third
prov
somewhat
troublesome
the
fourth
insupportable
the
fifth
was
tormenting
and
at
last
he
was
perfectly
outrageous
at
the
continual
peal
in
his
ears
of
no
monarch
happier
sir
than
you
you
say
right
and
at
being
daily
harangu
at
the
same
hour
whereupon
he
wrote
to
court
and
begg
of
his
majesty
to
recal
his
chamberlain
his
and
all
his
retinue
his
head
steward
and
his
cooks
and
promis
in
the
most
submissive
manner
to
be
less
vain
and
more
industrious
for
the
future
tho
he
require
so
much
adulations
nor
such
grand
entertainments
he
was
much
more
happy
for
as
has
it
continued
scene
of
pleasure
is
no
pleasure
at
every
day
gave
incontestable
proofs
of
his
wondrous
penetration
and
the
goodness
of
his
heart
he
was
ador
by
the
people
and
was
the
darling
of
the
king
the
little
difficulties
that
he
met
with
in
the
first
stage
of
his
life
serv
only
to
augment
his
present
felicity
every
night
however
he
had
some
unlucky
dream
or
another
that
gave
him
some
disturbance
one
while
he
imagin
himself
extended
on
a
bed
of
wither
plants
amongst
which
there
were
some
that
were
sharp
pointed
and
made
him
very
restless
and
uneasy
another
time
he
fancied
himself
repos
on
a
bed
of
roses
out
of
which
rush
a
serpent
that
stung
him
to
the
heart
with
his
envenom
tongue
alas
said
he
waking
i
was
one
while
upon
a
bed
of
hard
and
nauseous
plants
and
just
this
moment
repos
on
a
bed
of
roses
but
then
the
chap
vii
force
jealousy
the
misfortunes
that
attended
proceeded
in
a
great
measure
from
his
preferment
but
more
from
his
intrinsic
merit
every
day
he
had
familiar
converse
with
the
king
his
royal
master
and
his
august
consort
and
the
pleasure
arising
from
thence
was
greatly
enhanc
from
an
innate
ambition
of
pleasing
which
in
regard
to
wit
is
the
same
as
dress
is
to
beauty
his
youth
and
graceful
deportment
had
a
greater
influence
on
than
she
was
at
first
aware
of
tho
her
affection
for
him
daily
encreas
yet
she
was
perfectly
innocent
would
say
without
the
least
reserve
or
apprehension
of
fear
that
she
was
extreamly
pleas
with
the
company
of
one
who
was
not
only
a
favourite
of
her
husband
but
the
darling
of
the
whole
empire
she
was
continually
speaking
in
his
commendation
before
the
king
he
was
the
subject
of
her
whole
discourse
amongst
her
ladies
of
honour
who
were
as
lavish
of
their
praises
as
herself
such
repeated
discourses
however
innocent
made
a
deeper
impression
on
her
heart
than
she
at
that
time
apprehended
she
would
every
now
and
then
send
some
little
present
or
another
which
he
construed
as
the
result
of
a
greater
value
for
him
than
she
intended
she
said
no
more
of
him
as
she
thought
than
a
queen
might
innocently
do
who
was
perfectly
assur
of
his
attachment
to
her
husband
sometimes
indeed
she
would
express
her
self
with
an
air
of
tenderness
and
affection
was
much
handsomer
than
either
his
mistress
who
had
such
a
natural
antipathy
to
a
lord
or
his
late
loving
spouse
that
would
innocently
have
cut
his
nose
off
the
freedoms
which
took
her
tender
expressions
at
which
she
began
to
blush
the
glances
of
her
eye
which
she
would
turn
away
if
perceiv
and
which
she
fix
upon
his
kindled
in
the
heart
of
a
fire
which
struck
him
with
amazement
he
did
all
he
could
to
smother
it
he
call
up
all
the
philosophy
he
was
master
of
to
his
aid
but
all
in
vain
for
no
consolation
arose
from
those
reflections
duty
gratitude
and
an
injur
monarch
presented
themselves
before
his
eyes
as
avenging
deities
he
bravely
struggled
he
indeed
but
this
conquest
over
his
passions
which
he
was
oblig
to
check
every
moment
cost
him
many
a
deep
sigh
and
tear
he
durst
not
talk
with
the
queen
any
more
with
that
freedom
which
was
too
engaging
on
both
sides
his
eyes
were
obnubilated
his
discourse
was
forc
and
unconnected
he
turn
his
eyes
another
way
and
when
against
his
inclination
they
met
with
those
of
the
queen
he
found
that
tho
drown
in
tears
they
darted
flames
of
fire
they
in
silence
to
intimate
that
they
were
afraid
of
being
in
love
with
each
other
and
that
both
burn
with
a
fire
which
both
condemn
flew
from
her
presence
like
one
beside
himself
and
in
despair
his
heart
was
with
a
burthen
too
great
for
him
to
bear
in
the
heat
of
his
conflicts
he
disclos
the
secrets
of
his
heart
to
his
trusty
friend
as
one
who
having
long
groan
under
the
weight
of
an
inexpressible
anguish
of
mind
at
once
makes
known
the
cause
of
his
torments
by
the
groans
as
it
were
extorted
from
him
and
by
the
drops
of
a
cold
sweat
that
trickled
down
his
cheeks
said
to
him
is
now
some
considerable
time
since
i
have
discover
that
secret
passion
which
you
have
foster
in
your
bosom
and
yet
endeavour
to
conceal
even
from
your
self
the
passions
carry
along
with
them
such
strong
impressions
that
they
can
not
be
conceal
tell
me
ingenuously
and
be
your
own
accuser
whether
or
no
since
i
have
made
this
discovery
the
king
has
not
shewn
some
visible
marks
of
his
resentment
he
has
no
other
foible
but
that
of
being
the
most
jealous
mortal
breathing
you
take
more
pains
to
check
the
violence
of
your
passion
than
the
queen
herself
does
because
you
are
a
philosopher
because
in
short
you
are
is
but
a
weak
woman
and
tho
her
eyes
speak
too
visibly
and
with
too
much
imprudence
yet
she
does
not
think
her
self
being
conscious
of
her
innocence
to
her
own
misfortune
as
well
as
yours
she
is
too
unguarded
i
tremble
for
her
because
i
am
sensible
her
conscience
acquits
her
were
you
both
agreed
you
might
conceal
your
regard
for
each
other
from
all
the
world
a
rising
passion
that
is
smother
breaks
out
into
a
flame
love
when
once
gratified
knows
how
to
conceal
itself
with
art
shudder
at
the
proposition
of
ungratefully
violating
the
bed
of
his
royal
benefactor
and
never
was
there
a
more
loyal
subject
to
a
prince
tho
guilty
of
an
involuntary
crime
the
queen
however
repeated
the
name
of
so
often
and
her
cheeks
glow
with
such
a
red
when
ever
she
utter
it
she
was
one
while
so
transported
and
at
another
so
dejected
when
the
discourse
turn
upon
him
in
the
king
presence
she
was
in
such
a
reverie
so
confus
and
stupid
when
he
went
out
of
the
presence
that
her
deportment
made
the
king
extremely
uneasy
he
was
of
every
thing
he
saw
and
form
in
his
mind
an
idea
of
a
thousand
things
he
did
not
see
he
observ
particularly
that
sandals
were
blue
so
were
blue
likewise
that
as
the
queen
wore
yellow
ribbands
turbet
was
of
the
same
colour
these
were
shocking
circumstances
for
a
monarch
of
his
cast
of
mind
to
reflect
on
to
a
mind
in
short
so
distemper
as
his
was
suspicions
were
converted
into
real
facts
all
court
slaves
and
sycophants
are
so
many
spies
on
kings
and
queens
they
soon
discover
that
was
fond
and
jealous
his
envious
foe
who
was
as
incorrigible
as
ever
for
flints
will
never
soften
and
creatures
that
are
by
nature
venemous
forever
retain
their
poison
i
say
wrote
an
anonymous
letter
to
the
infamous
recourse
of
sordid
spirits
who
are
the
objects
of
universal
contempt
but
in
this
case
an
affair
of
the
last
importance
because
this
letter
tallied
with
the
baneful
suggestions
that
monarch
had
conceiv
in
short
his
thoughts
were
now
wholly
bent
upon
revenge
he
to
poison
on
a
certain
night
and
to
have
strangled
by
break
of
day
orders
for
that
purpose
were
expressly
given
to
a
merciless
inhuman
eunuch
the
ready
executioner
of
his
vengeance
at
that
critical
conjuncture
there
happen
to
be
a
dwarf
who
was
dumb
but
not
deaf
in
the
king
apartment
nobody
regarded
him
he
was
an
eye
and
of
all
that
pass
and
yet
no
more
suspected
than
any
irrational
domestic
animal
this
little
dwarf
had
conceiv
a
peculiar
regard
for
and
he
heard
with
equal
horror
and
surprize
the
king
orders
to
destroy
them
both
but
how
to
prevent
those
orders
from
being
put
into
execution
as
the
time
was
so
short
was
all
his
concern
he
could
not
write
is
true
but
he
had
luckily
learnt
to
draw
and
take
a
likeness
he
spent
a
good
part
of
the
night
in
delineating
with
crayons
on
a
piece
of
paper
the
imminent
danger
that
thus
attended
the
queen
in
one
corner
he
represented
the
king
highly
incens
and
giving
his
cruel
eunuch
the
fatal
orders
in
another
a
bowl
and
a
cord
upon
a
table
in
the
center
was
the
queen
expiring
in
the
arms
of
her
maids
of
honour
with
strangled
and
laid
dead
at
her
feet
in
the
horizon
was
the
rising
sun
to
denote
that
this
execrable
scene
was
to
be
exhibited
by
break
of
day
no
sooner
was
his
design
finish
but
he
ran
with
it
to
one
of
female
favourites
then
in
waiting
call
her
up
and
gave
her
to
understand
that
she
must
carry
the
draught
to
that
very
moment
in
the
mean
time
the
queen
attendants
tho
it
was
dead
of
night
knock
at
the
door
of
apartment
wak
him
and
into
his
hands
a
billet
from
the
queen
at
first
he
could
not
well
tell
whether
he
was
only
in
a
dream
or
not
but
soon
read
the
letter
with
a
trembling
hand
and
a
heavy
heart
words
express
his
surprise
and
the
agonies
of
despair
which
he
was
in

perusal

tho

to
drop
into

earth
he
had
but
one
trusty
servant
to
attend
him
and
overwhelm
with
grief
soon
lost
sight
of
his
dearly
beloved
friend
this
illustrious
fugitive
soon
reach
the
summit
of
a
little
hill
that
afforded
him
a
fair
prospect
of
the
whole
city
of
but
turning
his
eyes
back
towards
the
queen
palace
he
fainted
away
and
when
he
had
recover
his
senses
he
drown
his
eyes
in
a
flood
of
tears
and
with
impatience
wish
for
death
to
conclude
after
he
had
reflected
with
horror
on
the
deplorable
fate
of
the
most
amiable
creature
in
the
universe
and
of
the
most
meritorious
queen
that
ever
liv
he
for
a
moment
commanded
his
passion
and
with
a
sigh
made
the
following
exclamations
what
is
this
mortal
life
o
virtue
virtue
of
what
service
hast
thou
been
to
me
two
young
ladies
a
mistress
and
a
wife
have
prov
false
to
me
a
third
who
is
perfectly
innocent
and
ten
thousand
times
handsomer
than
either
of
them
has
suffer
death
is
probable
before
this
on
my
account
all
the
acts
of
benevolence
which
i
have
shewn
have
been
the
foundation
of
my
sorrows
and
i
have
been
only
rais
to
the
highest
spoke
of
fortune
wheel
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
be
tumbled
down
with
the
greater
force
had
i
been
as
abandon
as
some
miscreants
are
i
had
like
them
been
happy
his
head
thus
overwhelm
with
these
melancholy
reflections
his
eyes
thus
sunk
in
his
head
and
his
meagre
cheeks
all
pale
and
languid
and
in
a
word
his
very
soul
thus
plung
in
the
abyss
of
deep
despair
he
pursu
his
journey
towards
chap
viii
wife
steer
his
course
by
the
stars
that
shone
over
his
head
the
constellation
of
orion
and
the
radiant
directed
him
towards
the
pole
of
canope
he
reflected
with
admiration
on
those
immense
globes
of
light
which
appear
to
the
naked
eye
no
more
than
little
twinkling
lights
whereas
the
earth
he
was
then
traversing
which
in
reality
is
no
more
than
an
imperceptible
point
in
nature
seem
according
to
the
selfish
idea
we
generally
entertain
of
it
something
very
immense
and
very
magnificent
he
then
reflected
on
the
whole
race
of
mankind
and
look
upon
them
as
they
are
in
fact
a
parcel
of
insects
or
reptiles
devouring
one
another
on
a
small
atom
of
clay
this
just
idea
of
them
greatly
alleviated
his
misfortunes
recollecting
the
nothingness
if
we
may
be
allow
the
expression
of
his
own
being
and
even
of
itself
his
capacious
soul
now
soar
into
infinity
and
he
contemplated
with
the
same
freedom
as
if
she
was
from
her
earthly
partner
on
the
immutable
order
of
the
universe
but
as
soon
as
she
cower
her
wings
and
resumed
her
native
seat
he
began
to
consider
that
might
possibly
have
lost
her
life
for
his
sake
upon
which
his
thoughts
of
the
universe
all
at
once
and
no
other
objects
appear
before
his
eyes
but
his
giving
up
the
ghost
and
himself
with
a
sea
of
troubles
as
he
gave
himself
up
to
this
flux
and
reflux
of
sublime
philosophy
and
anxiety
of
mind
he
was
insensibly
arriv
on
the
frontiers
of
and
his
trusty
attendant
had
unknown
to
him
stept
into
the
first
village
and
sought
out
for
a
proper
apartment
for
his
master
and
himself
in
the
mean
time
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
adjacent
gardens
where
he
saw
not
far
distant
from
the
a
young
lady
all
drown
in
tears
calling
upon
heaven
and
earth
for
succour
in
her
distress
and
a
man
fir
with
rage
and
resentment
in
pursuit
after
her
he
had
now
just
overtaken
her
and
she
fell
prostrate
at
his
feet
imploring
his
forgiveness
he
loaded
her
with
a
thousand
reproaches
nor
did
he
spare
to
chastise
her
in
the
most
outrageous
manner
by
the
cruel
deportment
towards
her
he
concluded
that
the
man
was
a
jealous
husband
and
that
the
lady
was
an
inconstant
and
had
defil
his
bed
but
when
he
reflected
that
the
woman
was
a
perfect
beauty
and
to
his
thinking
something
like
the
unfortunate
he
perceiv
his
heart
yearn
with
compassion
towards
the
lady
and
swell
with
indignation
against
her
tyrant
for
sake
sir
assist
me
said
she
to
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
oh
deliver
me
out
of
the
hands
of
this
save
sir
o
save
my
life
upon
these
her
shocking
outcries
threw
himself
between
the
injur
lady
and
the
inexorable
brute
and
as
he
had
some
smattering
of
the
tongue
he
expostulated
with
him
in
his
own
dialect
and
said
dear
sir
if
you
are
with
the
least
spark
of
humanity
let
me
conjure
you
to
have
some
pity
and
remorse
for
so
beautiful
a
creature
have
some
regard
sir
to
the
weakness
of
her
sex
how
can
you
treat
a
lady
who
is
one
of
nature
in
such
a
rude
and
outrageous
manner
one
who
lies

forgiveness

one
who
has
no

than
her
tears
for
her
defence
oh
oh
said
the
fellow
in
a
fury
to
what
you
are
one
of
her
gallants
i
suppose
i
be
reveng
of
thee
thou
villain
this
moment
no
sooner
were
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
but
he
quits
hold
of
the
lady
in
whose
hair
he
had
twisted
his
fingers
before
takes
up
his
lance
in
a
fury
and
endeavours
to
the
utmost
of
his
to
plunge
it
in
the
stranger
heart
however
being
cool
warded
the
intended
blow
with
ease
he
laid
fast
hold
of
his
lance
towards
the
point
one
strove
to
recover
it
and
the
other
to
snatch
it
away
by
force
they
broke
it
between
them
whereupon
the
drew
his
sword

fought

a
hundred
rash
passes
one
after
another
which
the
latter
parried
with
the
utmost
dexterity
the
lady
sat
herself
upon
a
adjusting
her
and
looking
on
the
combatants
the
was
too
strong
for
but
was
more
nimble
and
active
the
latter
fought
as
a
man
whose
hand
was
guided
by
his
head
the
former
as
a
who
dealt
about
his
blows
at
random
took
the
advantage
made
a
plunge
at
him
and
disarm
him
and
forasmuch
as
he
found
that
the
was
hotter
than
ever
and
endeavour
all
he
could
to
throw
him
down
by
dint
of
strength
laid
fast

of
him
flew
upon
him
and
tripp
up
his
heels
after
that
holding
the
point
of
his
sword
to
his
breast
like
a
man
of
honour
gave
him
his
life
the
fir
with
rage
and
having
no
command
of
his
passion
drew
his
dagger
and
wounded
like
a
coward
whilst
the
victor
generously
forgave
him
upon
that
unexpected
action
being
incens
to
the
last
degree
plung
his
sword
deep
into
his
bosom
the
fetch
a
hideous
groan
and
died
upon
the
spot
then
approach
the
lady
and
with
a
kind
of
concern
in
the
softest
terms
told
her
that
he
was
oblig
to
kill
her
insulter
tho
against
his
inclinations
i
have
aveng
your
cause
and
deliver
you
out
of
the
merciless
hands
of
the
most
outrageous
man
i
ever
saw
now
madam
let
me
know
your
farther
will
and
pleasure
with
me
you
shall
die
you
villain
you
have
murder
my
love
oh
i
could
tear
your
heart
out
indeed
madam
said
you
had
one
of
the
most
oddest
lovers
i
ever
saw
he
beat
you
most
unmercifully
and
would
have
taken
away
my
life
because
you
call
me
in
to
your
assistance
would
to
god
he
was
but
alive
to
beat
me
again
said
she
blubbering
and
roaring
i
deserv
to
be
beat
i
gave
him
too
just
occasion
to
be
jealous
of
me
would
to
god
that
he
had
beat
me
and
you
had
died
in
his
stead
more
astonish
and
more
exasperated
than
ever
he
was
in
all
his
life
said
to
her
really
madam
you
put
on
such
extravagant
airs
that
you
tempt
me
pretty
as
you
are
to
thresh
you
most
cordially
in
my
turn
but
i
scorn
to
concern
my
self
any
more
about
you
upon
this
he
remounted
his
dromedary
and
made
the
best
of
his
way
towards
the
village
but
before
he
had
got
near
a
hundred
yards
he
upon
an
that
was
made
by
four
couriers
from
they
rode
full
speed
one
of
them
spying
the
young
widow
cried
out
there
she
is
that
she
she
answers
in
every
respect
to
the
description
we
had
of
her
they
never
took
the
least
notice
of
her
dead
gallant
but
secur
her
directly
oh
sir
cried
she
to
again
and
again
dear
sir
most
generous
stranger
once
more
deliver
me
from
a
pack
of
villains
i
most
humbly
beg
your
pardon
for
my
late
conduct
and
unjust
complaint
of
you
do
but
stand
my
friend
at
this
critical
conjuncture
and
i
be
your
most
obedient
vassal
till
death
had
now
no
inclination
to
fight
for
one
so
undeserving
any
more
find
some
other
to
be
your
fool
now
madam
you
sha
impose
upon
me
a
second
time
i
assure
you
madam
i
know
better
things
besides
he
was
wounded
and
bled
so
fast
that
he
wanted
assistance
himself
and
is
very
probable
that
the
sight
of
the
couriers
who
were
from
king
might
discompose
him
very
much
he
made
all
the
haste
he
could
towards
the
village
not
being
able
to
conceive
what
should
be
the
real
cause
of
the
young
lady
being
secur
by
those
officers
and
as
much
at
a
loss
at
the
same
time
what
to
think
of
such
a
termagant
and
a
coquet
chap
ix
captive
no
sooner
was
arriv
at
the
village
but
he
found
himself
surrounded
by
a
croud
the
people
one
and
all
cried
out
see
see
there
the
man
that
ran
away
with
the
beauteous
lady
and
murder
gentlemen
said
he
god
forbid
that
i
should
ever
entertain
a
thought
of
running
away
with
the
lady
you
speak
of
she
is
too
much
of
a
coquet
and
as
to
i
did
not
murder
him
but
him
in
my
own
defence
he
endeavour
all
he
could
to
take
my
life
away
because
i
entreated
him
to
take
some
pity
and
compassion
on
the
beauteous
whom
he
beat
most
unmercifully
i
am
a
stranger
who
am
fled
hither
for
shelter
and
is
highly
improbable
that
upon
my
first
entrance
into
a
country
where
i
came
for
safety
and
protection
i
should
be
guilty
of
two
such
enormous
crimes
as
that
of
running
away
with
another
man
partner
and
that
of
clandestinely
murdering
him
on
her
account
the
at
that
time
were
just
and
humane
the
populace
tis
true
hurried
to
the
but
they
took
care
in
the
first
place
to
stop
the
bleeding
of
his
wounds
and
afterwards
examin
the
suppos
delinquents
apart
in
order
to
discover
if
possible
the
real
truth
they
acquitted
of
the
charge
of
wilful
and
premeditated
murder
but
as
he
had
taken
a
subject
life
away
tho
in
his
own
defence
he
was
sentenc
to
be
a
slave
as
the
law
directed
his
two
beasts
were
sold
in
open
market
for
the
service
of
the
hamlet
what
money
he
had
was
distributed
amongst
the
inhabitants
and
he
and
his
attendant
were
expos
in
the
to
public
sale
an
merchant
by
name
purchas
them
both
but
as
the
valet
or
attendant
was
a
robust
man
and
better
cut
out
for
hard
labour
than
the
master
he
the
most
money
there
was
no
comparison
to
be
made
between
them
therefore
was
a
slave
subordinate
to
his
valet
they
them
both
however
by
a
chain
upon
their
legs
and
so
link
they
accompanied
their
master
home
as
they
were
on
the
road
comforted
his
and
exhorted
him
to
bear
his
misfortunes
with
patience
but
according
to
custom
he
made
several
reflections
on
the
vicissitudes
of
human
life
i
am
now
sensible
said
he
that
my
impropitious
fortune
has
some
malignant
influence
over
thine
every
occurrence
of
my
life
hitherto
has
prov
strangely
odd
and
unaccountable
in
the
first
place
i
was
sentenc
to
die
at
for
writing
a
short
panegyrick
on
the
king
my
master
in
the
next
i
narrowly
escap
being
strangled
for
the
queen
his
royal
consort
speaking
a
little
too
much
in
my
favour
and
here
i
am
a
with
thy
self
because
a
turbulent
fellow
of
a
gallant
would
beat
his
lady
however
comrade
let
us
march
on
boldly
let
not
our
courage
be
cast
down
all
this
may
possibly
have
a
happier
issue
than
we
expect
is
absolutely
necessary
that
these
merchants
should
have
slaves
and
why
should
not
you
and
i
as
we
are
but
men
be
slaves
as
thousands
of
others
are
this
master
of
ours
may
not
prove
inexorable
he
must
treat
his
slaves
with
some
thought
and
consideration
if
he
expects
them
to
do
his
work
this
was
his
discourse
to
his
comrade
but
his
mind
was
more
attentive
to
the
misfortunes
of
the
queen
of
two
days
afterwards
set
out
with
his
two
slaves
and
his
camels
for
his
tribe
liv
near
the
desert
of
the
way
was
long
and
tedious
during
the
journey
paid
a
much
greater
regard
to
valet
than
to
himself
because
the
former
was
the
most
able
to
load
the
camels
and
therefore
what
little
distinctions
were
made
they
were
in
his
favour
it
so
happen
that
one
of
the
camels
died
upon
the
road
the
load
which
the
beast
carried
was
immediately
divided
and
thrown
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
two
slaves
had
his
share
could
forbear
laughing
to
see
his
two
slaves
crouching
under
their
burthen
took
the
liberty
to
explain
the
reason
thereof
and
convinc
him
of
the
laws
of
the
equilibrium
the
merchant
was
a
little
startled
at
his
philosophical
discourse
and
look
upon
him
with
a
more
favourable
eye
than
at
first
perceiving
he
had
rais
his
curiosity
redoubled
it
by
instructing
him
in
several
material
points
which
were
in
some
measure
advantageous
to
him
in
his
way
of
business
such
as
the
specific
weight
of
metals
and
other
commodities
of
various
kinds
of
an
equal
bulk
the
properties
of
several
useful
animals
and
the
best
ways
and
means
to
make
such
as
were
wild
tame
by
degrees
and
fit
for
service
in
short
was
look
upon
by
his
master
as
a
perfect
oracle
now
thought
the
master
the
much
better
man
of
the
two
he
us
him
courteously
and
had
no
room
to
repent
of
his
indulgence
towards
him
being
got
to
their
journey
end
the
first
step
that
took
was
to
claim
a
debt
of
five
hundred
ounces
of
silver
of
a
who
had
borrow
it
in
the
presence
of
two
witnesses
but
both
of
them
were
dead
and
as
the
was
conscious
he
could
be
cast
for
want
of
evidence
appropriated
the
merchant
money
to
his
own
use
and
thank
god
that
it
lay
in
his
power
for
once
to
bite
an
with
impunity
discover
to
the
unhappy
situation
of
his
case
as
he
was
now
become
his
confident
where
was
it
pray
said
that
you
lent
this
large
sum
to
that
ungrateful
infidel
upon
a
large
stone
said
the
merchant
at
the
foot
of
mount
what
sort
of
a
man
is
your
debtor
said
oh
he
is
as
errand
a
rogue
as
ever
breath
that
i
take
for
granted
but
says
is
he
a
lively
active
man
or
is
he
a
dull
fellow
he
is
one
of
the
worst
of
in
the
world
but
the
merriest
most
sprightly
fellow
i
ever
met
with
very
well
said
let
me
be
one
of
your
council
when
your
cause
comes
to
be
heard
in
short
he
summon
the
to
attend
the
court
where
when
the
judge
was
sat
open
the
cause
thou
impartial
judge
of
this
court
of
equity
i
am
come
here
in
behalf
of
my
master
to
demand
of
the
defendant
five
hundred
ounces
of
silver
which
he
refuses
to
pay
and
would
fain
traverse
the
debt
have
you
friend
your
witnesses
ready
to
prove
the
loan
said
the
judge
no
they
are
dead
but
there
is
a
large
stone
still
subsisting
on
which
the
money
was
deposited
and
if
your
excellence
will
be
pleas
to
order
the
stone
to
be
brought
in
court
i
do
doubt
but
the
evidence
it
will
give
will
be
proof
sufficient
of
the
fact
i
hope
your
excellence
will
order
that
the
and
myself
shall
be
oblig
to
attend
the
court
till
the
stone
comes
and
i
dispatch
a
special
messenger
to
fetch
it
at
my
master
expence
your
request
is
very
reasonable
said
the
judge
do
as
you
propose
and
so
call
another
cause
when
the
court
was
ready
to
break
up
well
said
the
judge
to
is
your
stone
come
yet
the
with
a
sneer
replied
your
excellence
may
wait
here
till
this
time
before
the
stone
will
appear
in
court
for
is
above
six
mile
off
and
it
will
require
fifteen
men
to
remove
it
from
its
place
is
well
replied
i
told
your
excellence
that
the
stone
would
be
a
very
material
evidence
since
the
defendant
can
point
out
the
place
where
the
stone
lies
he
tacitly
confesses
that
it
was
upon
that
stone
the
money
was
deposited
the
thus
unexpectedly
confuted
was
soon
oblig
to
acknowledge
the
debt
the
judge
order
that
the
should
be
tied
fast
to
the
stone
without
victuals
or
drink
till
he
should
advance
the
five
hundred
ounces
of
silver
which
were
soon
paid
accordingly
and
the
releas
the
slave
and
this
remarkable
were
in
great
repute
all
over
chap
x
funeral
pile
transported
with
his
good
success
of
a
slave
made
his
favourite
companion
and
confident
he
found
him
as
necessary
in
the
conduct
of
his
affairs
as
the
king
of
had
before
done
in
the
administration
of
his
government
and
lucky
it
was
for
that
had
no
wife
he
discover
that
his
master
was
in
his
temper
benevolent
strictly
honest
and
a
man
of
good
natural
parts
was
very
much
concern
that
one
of
so
much
sense
should
pay
divine
adoration
to
a
whole
host
of
created
tho
celestial
beings
that
is
to
say
the
sun
moon
and
stars
according
to
the
antient
custom
of
the
he
talk
at
first
to
his
master
with
great
precaution
on
so
important
a
topick
but
at
last
told
him
in
direct
terms
that
they
were
created
bodies
as
others
tho
of
less
lustre
and
that
there
was
no
more
adoration
due
to
them
than
to
a
stock
or
a
stone
but
said
they
are
eternal
beings
to
whom
we
are
indebted
for
all
the
blessings
we
enjoy
they
animate
nature
they
regulate
the
seasons
they
are
in
a
word
at
such
an
infinite
distance
from
us
that
it
would
be
downright
impious
not
to
adore
them
you
are
more
indebted
said
to
the
waters
of
the
red
sea
which
transport
so
many
valuable
commodities
into
the
why
pray
may
not
they
be
deem
as
antient
as
the
stars
and
if
you
are
so
fond
of
paying
your
adoration
on
account
of
their
vast
distance
why
do
you
adore
the
land
of
the
which
lies
in
the
utmost
extremities
of
the
earth
no
said
there
is
something
so
surprisingly
more
brilliant
in
the
stars
than
what
you
speak
of
that
a
man
must
adore
them
whether
he
will
or
not
at
the
close
of
the
evening
planted
a
long
range
of
candles
in
the
front
of
his
tent
where
and
he
were
to
sup
that
night
and
as
soon
as
he
perceiv
his
patron
to
be
at
the
door
he
fell
prostrate
on
his
knees
before
the
o
ye
everlasting
luminaries
be
always
propitious
to
your
votary
said
having
repeated
these
words
so
loud
as
might
hear
them
he
sat
down
to
table
without
taking
the
least
notice
of
what
said
somewhat
startled
at
his
conduct
art
thou
at
thy
prayers
before
supper
i
act
just
as
inconsistently
sir
as
you
do
i
worship
these
candles
without
reflecting
on
their
makers
or
yourself
who
are
my
most
beneficent
patron
took
the
hint
and
was
conscious
of
the
reproof
that
was
conceal
so
genteely
under
a
vail
the
superior
wisdom
of
his
slave
enlightned
his
mind
and
from
that
hour
he
was
less
lavish
than
ever
he
had
been
of
his
incense
to
those
created
beings
and
for
the
future
paid
his
adoration
to
the
eternal
god
who
made
them
at
that
time
there
was
a
most
hideous
custom
in
high
repute
all
over
which
came
originally
from
but
having
met
with
the
sanction
of
the
bigotted
brachmans
threatn
to
spread
its
infection
all
over
the
when
a
married
man
happen
to
die
if
his
dearly
beloved
widow
ever
expected
to
be
esteem
a
saint
she
must
throw
herself
headlong
upon
her
husband
this
was
look
upon
as
a
solemn
festival
and
was
call
the
widow

that
tribe
which
could
boast
of
the
greatest
number
of

look
upon
as
the
most
meritorious

who
was
of
the
tribe
of
happen
just
at
that
juncture
to
be
dead
and
his
widow
by
name
who
was
a
noted
devotee
publish
the
day
nay
the
hour
that
she
to
throw
herself
according
to
custom
on
her
deceased
funeral
pile
and
be
attended
by
a
concert
of
drums
and
trumpets
remonstrated
to
what
a
shocking
custom
this
was
and
how
directly
repugnant
to
human
nature
by
permitting
young
widows
almost
every
day
to
become
wilful
when
they
might
be
of
service
to
their
country
either
by
the
addition
of
new
subjects
or
by
the
education
of
such
as
demanded
their
maternal
indulgence
and
by
arguing
seriously
with
for
some
time
he
forc
from
him
at
last
an
ingenuous
confession
that
the
barbarous
custom
then
subsisting
ought
if
possible
to
be
abolish
is
now
replied
above
a
thousand
years
since
the
widows
of
have
been
indulg
with
this
privilege
of
dying
with
their
husbands
and
how
shall
any
one
dare
to
abrogate
a
law
that
has
been
establish
time
out
of
mind
is
there
any
thing
more
inviolable
than
even
an
antient
error
but
replied
reason
is
of
more
antient
date
than
the
custom
you
plead
for
do
you
communicate
these
sentiments
to
the
sovereigns
of
your
tribes
and
in
the
mean
while
i
go
and
sound
the
widow
inclinations
accordingly
he
paid
her
a
visit
and
having
insinuated
himself
into
her
favour
by
a
few
compliments
on
her
beauty
after
urging
what
a
pity
it
was
that
a
young
widow
mistress
of
so
many
charms
should
make
away
with
herself
for
no
other
reason
but
to
mingle
her
ashes
with
a
husband
that
was
dead
he
notwithstanding
applauded
her
for
her
heroic
constancy
and
courage
i
perceive
madam
said
he
you
was
excessively
fond
of
your
deceased
spouse
not
i
truly
the
young
devotee
he
was
a
brute
infected
with
a
groundless
jealousy
of
my
virtue
and
in
short
a
perfect
tyrant
but
notwithstanding
all
this
i
am
determin
to
comply
with
our
custom
surely
then
madam
there
a
sort
of
secret
pleasure
in
being
burnt
alive
alas
with
a
sigh
cried
is
a
shock
indeed
to
nature
but
must
be
complied
with
for
all
that
i
am
a
profess
devotee
and
should
i
shew
the
least
reluctance
my
reputation
would
be
lost
for
ever
all
the
world
would
laugh
at
me
should
i
not
burn
myself
on
this
occasion
having
forc
her
ingenuously
to
confess
that
she
parted
with
her
life
more
out
of
regard
to
what
the
world
would
say
of
her
and
out
of
pride
and
ostentation
than
any
real
love
for
the
deceas
he
talk
to
her
for
some
considerable
time
so
rationally
and
us
so
many
prevailing
arguments
with
her
to
justify
her
due
regard
for
the
life
which
she
was
going
to
throw
away
that
she
began
to
wave
the
thought
and
entertain
a
secret
affection
for
her
friendly
monitor
pray
madam
tell
me
said
how
would
you
dispose
of
yourself
upon
the
supposition
that
you
could
shake
off
this
vain
and
barbarous
notion
why
said
dame
with
an
amorous
glance
i
think
verily
i
should
accept
of
yourself
for
a
second
the
memory
of
had
made
too
strong
an
impression
on
his
mind
to
close
with
this
warm
declaration
he
took
his
leave
however
that
moment
and
waited
on
the
chiefs
he
communicated
to
them
the
substance
of
their
private
conversation
and
prevailed
with
them
to
make
it
a
law
for
the
future
that
no
widow
should
be
allow
to
fall
a
victim
to
a
deceased
husband
till
after
she
had
admitted
some
young
man
to
converse
with
her
in
private
for
a
whole
hour
together
the
law
was
pass
accordingly
and
not
one
widow
in
all
from
that
day
to
this
ever
observ
the
custom
was
to
alone
that
the
dames
were
indebted
for
the
abolition
in
one
hour
of
a
custom
so
very
inhuman
that
had
been
practis
for
such
a
number
of
ages
therefore
with
the
strictest
justice
was
look
upon
by
all
the
fair
sex
in
as
their
most
bountiful
benefactor
chap
xi
evening
who
would
never
stir
out
without
his
in
whom
alone
as
he
thought
all
wisdom
center
resolv
to
take
him
with
him
to
fair
whither
the
richest
merchants
round
the
whole
habitable
globe
us
annually
to
resort
was
delighted
to
see
such
a
concourse
of
substantial
tradesmen
from
all
countries
assembled
together
in
one
place
it
appear
to
him
as
if
the
whole
universe
was
but
one
large
family
and
all
happily
met
together
at
on
the
second
day
of
the
fair
he
sat
down
to
table
with
an
an
that
liv
on
the
banks
of
the
river
an
inhabitant
of
a
a
and
several
other
foreigners
who
by
their
frequent
voyages
towards
the
gulf
were
so
far
conversant
with
the
language
as
to
be
able
to
discourse
freely
and
be
mutually
understood
the
began
to
fly
into
a
passion
what
a
scandalous
place
is
this
said
he
where
they
refuse
to
lend
me
a
thousand
ounces
of
gold
upon
the
best
security
that
can
possibly
be
offer
pray
said
what
may
the
commodity
be
that
you
would
deposit
as
a
pledge
for
the
sum
you
mention
why
the
corpse
of
my
deceased
aunt
said
he
who
was
one
of
the
finest
women
in
all
she
was
my
constant
companion
but
unhappily
died
upon
the
road
i
have
taken
so
much
care
that
no
mummy
whatever
can
equal
it
and
was
i
in
my
own
country
i
could
be
furnish
with
what
sum
soever
i
pleas
were
i
dispos
to
mortgage
it
is
a
strange
thing
that
nobody
here
will
advance
so
small
a
sum
upon
so
valuable
a
commodity
no
sooner
had
he
express
his
resentment
but
he
was
going
to
cut
up
a
fine
boil
pullet
in
order
to
make
a
meal
o
when
an
laid
hold
of
his
hand
and
with
deep
concern
cried
out
for
god
sake
what
are
you
about
why
said
the
i
design
to
make
a
wing
of
this
fowl
one
part
of
my
supper
pray
good
sir
consider
what
you
are
doing
said
the
is
very
possible
that
the
soul
of
the
deceas
lady
may
have
taken
its
residence
in
that
fowl
and
you
would
surely
run
the
risque
of
eating
up
your
aunt
to
boil
a
fowl
is
doubtless
a
most
shameful
outrage
done
to
nature
pshaw
what
a
pother
you
make
about
the
boiling
of
a
fowl
and
flying
in
the
face
of
nature
replied
the
in
a
pet
tho
we
pay
divine
adoration
to
the
ox
yet
we
can
make
a
hearty
meal
of
a
piece
of
roast
beef
for
all
that
is
it
possible
sir
that
your
should
act
so
absurdly
as
to
pay
an
ox
the
tribute
of
divine
worship
said
the
absurd
as
you
think
it
said
the
other
the
ox
has
been
the
principal
object
of
adoration
all
over
for
these
hundred
and
thirty
five
thousand
years
and
the
most
has
never
been
as
yet
so
impious
as
to
it
ay
sir
an
hundred
thirty
five
thousand
years
say
you
surely
you
must
be
out
a
little
in
your
calculation
is
but
about
fourscore
thousand
years
since
was
first
inhabited
sure
i
am
we
are
a
more
antient
people
than
you
are
and
our
prohibited
the
eating
of
beef
long
before
your
nation
ever
erected
an
altar
in
honour
of
the
ox
or
ever
put
one
upon
a
spit
what
a
racket
you
make
about
your
is
he
able
to
stand
the
least
in
competition
with
our
said
the
let
us
hear
pray
what
mighty
feats
have
been
done
by
your
boasted
why
replied
the
he
first
taught
his
votaries
to
write
and
read
and
is
to
him
alone
all
the
world
is
indebted
for
the
invention
of
the
noble
game
of
chess
you
are
quite
out
sir
in
your
notion
said
a
who
sat
within
hearing
all
these
invaluable
blessings
were
deriv
from
the
fish
and
is
that
alone
to
which
the
tribute
of
divine
adoration
is
justly
due
all
the
world
will
tell
you
that
was
a
divine
being
whose
tail
was
pure
gold
whose
head
resembled
that
of
a
man
tho
indeed
the
features
were
much
more
beautiful
and
that
he
condescended
to
visit
the
earth
three
hours
every
day
for
the
instruction
of
mankind
he
had
a
numerous
issue
as
is
very
well
known
and
all
of
them
were
powerful
monarchs
i
have
a
picture
of
it
at
home
to
which
as
in
duty
i
ought
i
say
my
prayers
at
night
before
i
go
to
bed
and
every
morning
that
i
rise
there
is
no
harm
sir
as
i
can
conceive
in
partaking
of
a
piece
of
roast
beef
but
doubtless
is
a
mortal
sin
a
crime
of
the
blackest
dye
to
touch
a
piece
of
fish
besides
you
can
not
justly
boast
of
so
illustrious
an
origin
and
you
are
both
of
you
mere
moderns
in
comparison
to
us
you
lay
claim
to
no
more
than
years
and
you
but
of
whereas
we
have
almanacks
that
are
dated
centuries
backwards
take
my
word
for
it
i
speak
nothing
but
truth
renounce
your
errors
and
i
make
each
of
you
a
present
of
a
fine
portrait
of
our
a
native
of
entring
into
the
debate
said
i
have
a
very
great
veneration
not
only
for
the
and
but
for
and
the
but
in
my
humble
opinion
the
or
as
is
by
some
call
the
is
an
object
more
deserving
of
divine
adoration
than
any
ox
or
fish
how
much
soever
you
may
boast
of
their
respective
perfections
all
i
shall
say
in
regard
to
my
native
country
is
of
much
greater
extent
than
all
and
the
put
together
i
shall
lay
no
stress
on
the
antiquity
of
my
country
for
i
imagine
is
of
much
greater
importance
to
be
the
happiest
people
than
the
most
antient
under
the
sun
however
since
you
were
talking
of
the
almanacks
i
must
beg
the
liberty
to
tell
you
that
ours
are
look
upon
to
be
the
best
all
over
and
that
we
had
several
very
correct
ones
before
the
art
of
arithmetick
was
ever
heard
of
in
chinese
li
properly
speaking
natural
light
or
reason
tien
heavens
or
the
supreme
you
are
all
of
you
a
parcel
of
illiterate
ignorant
bigots
cry
a
is
plain
you
know
nothing
of
the
chaos
and
that
the
world
as
it
now
stands
is
owing
wholly
to
and
the
ran
on
for
a
considerable
time
but
was
at
last
interrupted
by
a
who
having
drank
deep
during
the
whole
time
of
this
debate
thought
himself
ten
times
wiser
than
any
of
his
antagonists
and
wrapping
out
a
great
oath
insisted
that
all
their
gods
were
nothing
if
set
in
competition
with
the
or
the
misletoe
on
the
oak
as
for
my
part
said
he
i
carry
some
of
it
always
in
my
pocket
as
to
my
ancestors
they
were
and
the
only
men
worth
talking
of
in
the
whole
world
is
true
indeed
they
would
now
and
then
make
a
meal
of
their
but
that
ought
not
to
be
urg
as
any
objection
to
his
country
and
in
short
if
any
one
of
you
or
all
of
you
shall
dare
to
say
any
thing
disrespectful
of
i
defend
its
cause
to
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
the
quarrel
grew
warmer
and
warmer
and
expected
that
the
table
would
be
overset
and
that
would
ensue
who
had
once
open
his
lips
during
the
whole
controversy
at
last
rose
up
and
address
himself
to
the
in
the
first
place
as
being
the
most
noisy
and
outrageous
sir
said
he
your
notions
in
this
affair
are
very
just
good
sir
oblige
me
with
a
bit
of
your
misletoe
then
turning
about
he
expatiated
on
the
eloquence
of
the
and
in
a
word
soften
in
the
most
artful
manner
all
the
contending
parties
he
said
but
little
indeed
to
the
because
he
was
more
cool
and
sedate
than
any
of
the
others
to
conclude
he
address
them
all
in
general
terms
to
this
or
the
like
effect
my
dear
friends
you
have
been
contesting
all
this
while
about
an
important
topick
in
which
is
evident
you
are
all
unanimously
agreed
agreed
quotha
they
all
cried
in
an
angry
tone
how
so
pray
why
said
he
to
the
hot
testy
is
it
not
true
that
you
do
not
in
effect
adore
this
misletoe
but
that
being
who
created
that
misletoe
and
the
oak
to
which
it
is
so
closely
united
doubtless
sir
reply
the
and
you
sir
said
he
to
the
you
revere
thro
your
venerable
the
great
author
of
every
ox
being
we
do
so
said
the
the
mighty
tho
the
sovereign
of
the
sea
continued
he
must
give
precedence
to
that
power
who
made
both
the
sea
and
every
fish
that
dwells
therein
we
allow
it
said
the
the
adds
he
and
the
acknowledge
one
supreme
being
or
first
cause
as
well
as
you
as
to
what
that
profound
worthy
gentleman
the
has
advanc
is
i
must
own
a
little
above
my
weak
comprehension
but
i
am
fully
persuaded
that
he
will
allow
there
is
a
supreme
being
on
whom
his
favourite
matter
and
form
are
entirely
dependent
the
who
was
look
upon
as
a
sage
amongst
them
said
with
abundance
of
gravity
that
had
made
a
very
just
construction
of
his
meaning
now
gentlemen
i
appeal
to
you
all
said
whether
you
are
not
unanimous
to
a
man
in
the
debate
upon
the
carpet
and
whether
there
are
any
just
grounds
for
the
least
divisions
or
animosities
amongst
you
the
whole
company
cool
at
once
caress
him
and
after
he
had
sold
off
all
his
goods
and
merchandize
at
a
round
price
took
his
friend
home
with
him
to
the
land
of
upon
his
first
arrival
was
inform
that
a
prosecution
had
been
carried
on
against
him
during
his
absence
and
that
the
sentence
pronounc
against
him
was
that
he
should
be
burnt
alive
before
a
slow
fire
chap
xii
rendezvous
whilst
attended
his
friend
to
the
priests
of
the
stars
were
determin
to
punish
him
as
all
the
costly
jewels
and
other
valuable
decorations
in
which
every
young
widow
that
sacrificed
her
self
on
her
husband
were
their
customary
fees
is
no
great
wonder
indeed
that
they
were
inclin
to
burn
poor
for
playing
them
such
a
scurvy
trick
therefore
was
accus
of
holding
heretical
and
damnable
tenets
in
regard
to
the
celestial
host
they
depos
and
swore
that
he
had
been
heard
to
aver
that
the
stars
never
sat
in
the
sea
this
horrid
blasphemous
declaration
all
the
judges
and
they
were
ready
to
rend
their
mantles
at
the
sound
of
such
an
impious
assertion
and
they
would
have
made
had
he
been
a
man
of
substance
paid
very
severely
for
his
heretical
notions
but
in
the
height
of
their
pity
and
compassion
for
even
such
an
infidel
they
would
lay
no
fine
upon
him
but
content
themselves
with
seeing
him
roasted
alive
before
a
slow
fire
tho
without
hopes
of
success
us
all
the
interest
he
had
to
save
his
bosom
friend
from
so
shocking
a
death
but
they
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
all
his
remonstrances
and
oblig
him
to
hold
his
tongue
the
young
widow
who
by
this
time
was
not
only
reconcil
to
living
a
little
longer
but
had
some
taste
for
the
pleasures
of
life
and
knew
that
she
was
entirely
indebted
to
for
it
resolv
if
possible
to
free
her
benefactor
from
being
burnt
as
he
had
before
convinc
her
of
the
folly
of
it
in
her
case
she
ponder
upon
this
weighty
affair
very
seriously
but
said
nothing
to
any
one
whomsoever
was
to
be
executed
the
next
day
and
she
had
only
a
few
hours
left
to
carry
her
project
into
execution
now
the
reader
shall
hear
with
how
much
benevolence
and
discretion
this
amiable
widow
behav
on
this
emergent
occasion
in
the
first
place
she
made
use
of
the
most
costly
perfumes
and
drest
herself
to
the
utmost
advantage
to

her
charms
as
conspicuous
as
possible

thus
gaily
attir
demanded
a
private
audience
of
the
high
priest
of
the
stars
upon
her
first
admittance
into
his
august
and
venerable
presence
she
address
herself
in
the
following
terms
o
thou
and
son
of
the
great
bear
brother
of
the
bull
and
first
cousin
to
the
dog
these
you
must
know
were
the
pontiff
high
titles
i
come
to
confess
myself
before
you
my
conscience
is
my
accuser
and
i
am
terribly
afraid
i
have
been
guilty
of
a
mortal
sin
by
declining
the
stated
custom
of
burning
my
self
on
my
husband
what
could
tempt
me
in
short
to
a
prolongation
of
my
life
i
ca
imagine
i
who
am
grown
a
perfect
skeleton
all
wrinkled
and
deform
she
paus
and
pulling
off
with
a
negligent
but
artful
air
her
long
silk
gloves
she
display
a
soft
plump
naked
arm
and
white
as
snow
you
see
sir
said
she
that
all
my
charms
are
blasted
blasted
madam
said
the
luscious
pontiff
no
your
charms
are
still
resistless
his
eyes
and
his
mouth
with
which
he
kiss
her
hand
confirm
their
power
such
an
arm
madam
by
the
great
i
never
saw
before
alas
said
the
widow
with
a
modest
blush
my
arm
sir
is
probable
may
have
the
advantage
of
any
hidden
part
but
see
good
father
what
a
neck
is
here
as
yellow
as
saffron
an
object
not
worth
regarding
then
she
display
such
a
snowy
panting
bosom
that
nature
could
not
mend
it
a
on
an
ivory
apple
would
if
set
in
competition
with
her
spotless
whiteness
make
no
better
appearance
than
common
madder
upon
a
shrub
and
the
whitest
wool
just
out
of
the
laver
were
she
but
by
would
seem
but
of
a
hue
her
neck
her
large
black
sparkling
eyes
that
languishingly
roll
and
seem
as
on
fire
her
lovely
cheeks
glowing
with
white
and
red
her
nose
that
was
not
unlike
the
tower
of
mount
her
lips
which
were
like
two
borders
of
coral
inclosing
two
rows
of
the
best
pearls
in
the
sea
such
a
combination
i
say
of
charms
made
the
old
pontiff
judge
she
was
scarce
twenty
years
of
age
and
in
a
kind
of
flutter
to
make
her
a
declaration
of
his
tender
regard
for
her
perceiving
him
enamour
begg
his
interest
in
favour
of
alas
my
dear
charmer
my
interest
alone
when
you
request
the
favour
would
be
but
a
poor
compliment
i
take
care
his
acquittance
shall
be
signed
by
three
more
of
my
brother
priests
do
you
sign
first
however
said
with
all
my
soul
said
the
amorous
pontiff
provided
you
be
kind
my
dearest
you
do
me
too
much
honour
said
but
should
you
give
your
self
the
trouble
to
pay
me
a
visit
after
sunset
and
as
soon
as
the
star
twinkles
on
the
horizon
you
shall
find
me
most
venerable
father
repos
upon
a
silver
sopha
where
you
shall
use
your
pleasure
with
your
humble
servant
with
that
she
made
him
a
low
courtesy
took
up
general
release
as
soon
as
duely
sign
and
left
the
old
doatard
all
over
love
tho
somewhat
diffident
of
his
own
abilities
the
residue
of
the
day
he
spent
in
his
bagnio
he
drank
large
enlivening
draughts
of
a
water
distill
from
the
cinnamon
of
and
the
costly
spices
of
and
and
waited
with
the
utmost
impatience
for
the
of
the
brilliant

the
mean
time
went
to
the
second
pontiff
he
assur
her
that
the
sun
moon
and
all
the
starry
host
of
were
but
languid
fires
to
her
bright
eyes
he
put
the
question
to
her
in
short
at
once
and
agreed
to
sign
upon
her
compliance
she
herself
to
be
and
made
an
assignation
to
meet
him
at
a
certain
place
as
soon
as
the
star
should
make
its
appearance
from
him
she
repair
to
the
third
and
fourth
pontiff
taking
care
wherever
she
went
to
see
acquittance
duely
sign
and
made
fresh
appointments
at
the
rising
of
star
after
star
when
she
had
carried
her
point
thus
far
she
sent
a
proper
message
to
the
judges
of
the
court
who
had
condemn
requesting
that
they
would
come
to
her
house
that
she
might
advise
with
them
upon
an
affair
of
the
last
importance
they
waited
on
her
accordingly
she
produc

duly
sign
by
four
several
hands
and
told
them
the
definitive
treaty
between
all
the
contracting
parties
each
of
the
pontifical
gallants
observ
their
summons
to
a
moment
each
was
startled
at
the
sight
of
his
rival
but
perfectly
thunderstruck
to
see
the
judges
before
whom
the
widow
had
laid
open
her
case
procur
an
absolute
pardon
and
was
so
charm
with
the
artful
address
of
that
he
married
her
the
next
day
went
afterwards
to
throw
himself
at
the
feet
of
his
fair
benefactress
and
he
took
their
leave
of
each
other
with
tears
in
their
eyes
and
vowing
that
an
eternal
mutual
friendship
should
be
preserv
between
them
and
in
short
should
fortune
at
any
time
afterwards
prove
more
propitious
than
could
well
be
expected
to
either
party
the

partake
of
an
equal

of
his
success

his
course

on
the
hard
fate
of

on

so
obstinately
darted
down
their
malignant
rays
and
continu
daily
to
torment
him

said
he

four
hundred
ounces
of
gold
for

out

him
cried
out
whatever
you

as
for
your

that
is

at
our

his
sword
and
as
his

was
a
very
couragious
fellow
he
drew
likewise
those
who
laid

on
them

fell
a
sacrifice
to
their
fury
their
numbers
redoubled

still
both
dauntless

to

when
two
men
defend
themselves
against
a

the
contest
doubtless

not

the
master
of
the
castle
one
by
name
having
been
an
from
his
window
of
the
intrepidity
and
surprising
exploits
of
took
a
fancy
to
him
he
ran
down
therefore
in
haste
and
giving
orders
himself
to
his
vassals
to
desist
deliver
the
two
travellers
out
of
their
hands
whatever
goods
or
chattels
said
he
come
upon
my
territories
are
my
effects
and
whatever
i
find
likewise
that
is
valuable
upon
the
premises
of
others
is
my
free
booty
but
as
you
appear
sir
to
me
to
be
a
gentleman
of
uncommon
courage
you
shall
prove
an
exception
to
my
general
rule
upon
this
he
invited
into
his
magnificent
mansion
giving
his
inferior
officers
strict
orders
to
use
him
with
all
due
respect
and
at
night
was
desirous
of
supping
with
the
lord
of
the
mansion
was
one
of
those
that
are
call
but
a
man
who
now
and
then
did
good
actions
amongst
a
thousand
bad
ones
he
without
mercy
but
was
liberal
in
his
benefactions
when
in
action
intrepid
but
in
traffick
easy
enough
a
perfect

very
frank
and
open
pleas
him
extremely
his
conversation
being
very
lively
prolong
their
repast
at
last
said
to
him
i
would
advise
you
sir
to
enlist
yourself
in
my
troop
you
can
not
possibly
do
a
better
thing
my
profession
is
none
of
the
worst
and
in
time
you
may
become
perhaps
as
great
a
man
as
myself
may
i
presume
sir
to
ask
you
one
question
how
long
may
you
have
follow
this
honourable
calling
from
my
youth
upwards
replied
his
host
i
was
only
a
at
first
to
an
who
indeed
was
courteous
enough
but
servitude
was
a
state
of
life
i
could
not
brook
it
made
me
to
see
in
a
wide
world
which
ought
to
be
divided
fairly
between
mankind
that
fate
had
reserv
for
me
so
scanty
a
portion
i
communicated
my
grievance
to
an
old
sage
son
said
he
never
despair
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
grain
of
sand
that
bemoan
itself
as
being
nothing
more
than
a
worthless
of
the
deserts
at
the
expiration
however
of
a
few
years
it
became
that
inestimable
diamond
which
at
this
very
hour
is
the
richest
and
most
admir
ornament
of
the
crown
the
old
man
discourse
fir
me
with
some
ambition
i
was
conscious
to
myself
that
i
was
at
that
time
the
he
mention
but
was
determin
if
possible
to
become
the
at
my
first
setting
out
i
stole
two
horses
then
i
got
into
a
gang
where
we
play
at
small
game
and
stopp
the
small
caravans
thus
i
gradually
lessen
the
wide
disproportion
which
there
was
at
first
between
me
and
the
rest
of
mankind
i
enjoy
not
only
my
full
share
of
the
good
things
of
this
life
but
enjoy
them
with
usury
i
was
look
upon
as
a
man
of
consequence
and
i
procur
this
castle
by
my
military
atchievements
the
of
had
thoughts
of
dispossessing
me
but
i
was
then
too
rich
to
be
any
ways
afraid
of
him
i
gave
the
a
certain
sum
of
money
upon
condition
that
i
kept
quiet
possession
of
my
castle
and
moreover
i
my
domains
for
he
constituted
me
at
the
same
time
treasurer
of
the
imports
that
paid
to
the
king
of
kings
i
executed
my
trust
in
every
respect
as
i
ought
in
the
capacity
of
a
collector
but
i
never
did
nor
never
intended
to
balance
my
accounts
the
grand
of
sent
hither
in
the
name
of
the
king
a
petty
with
a
commission
to
strangle
me
he
and
his
attendants
arriv
here
with
his
royal
warrant
i
was
appriz
of
the
whole
affair
and
accordingly
order
his
whole
retinue
consisting
of
four
inferior
officers
to
be
strangled
before
his
face
after
the
same
manner
as
was
intended
for
my
execution
after
this
i
ask
him
what
he
thought
the
commission
with
which
he
was
entrusted
might
reasonably
be
valued
at
he
answer
that
he
presum
his
premium
had
he
succeeded
might
have
amounted
to
about
three
hundred
pieces
of
gold
i
made
him
sensible
that
it
would
be
for
his
interest
to
be
a
commission
officer
under
me
i
made
him
accordingly
deputy
he
is
at
this
very
day
not
only
the
best
officer
but
the
richest
i
have
in
all
my
court
if
my
word
may
be
credited
i
raise
your
fortune
as
i
have
done
his
never
was
trade
brisker
in
our
way
for
is
knock
on
the
head
and
all
in
the
utmost
confusion
kill
said
you
cry
and
pray
sir
what
is
become
of
his
royal
consort
i
know
nothing
at
all
of
that
affair
replied
all
that
i
have
to
say
is
that
became
a
perfect
madman
and
had
his
brains
beat
out
that
all
the
people
in
are
cutting
one
another
throats
and
that
the
whole
empire
is
laid
waste
that
there
is
still
an
opportunity
for
making
several
bold
pushes
and
let
me
tell
you
sir
i
have
done
my
part
and
made
the
most
o
but
the
queen
sir
said
pray
favour
me
so
far
as
to
inform
me
if
you
know
any
thing
of
the
queen
i
have
heard
great
talk
said
he
of
a
certain
prince
of
is
very
possible
she
may
have
listed
herself
amongst
his
concubines
if
she
had
the
good
fortune
to
escape
the
resentment
of
those
popular
tumults
but
my
head
sir
is
better
turn
for
the
highway
than
for
news
i
have
taken
several
ladies
prisoners
in
the
course
of
my
excursions
i
keep
none
of
them
for
my
part
and
as
to
such
as
are
handsomer
than
ordinary
i
make
the
best
market
i
can
of
them
without
enquiring
who
they
are
their
quality
or
titles
will
fetch
no
price
at
all
a
queen
if
she
be
homely
is
worth
nothing
is
probable
sir
i
have
dispos
of
the
lady
myself
and
is
possible
likewise
she
may
be
dead
is
no
concern
of
mine
and
to
my
thinking
it
should
be
an
affair
of
no
manner
of
importance
to
you
after
this
declaration
he
drank
so
hard
and
confounded
his
ideas
in
such
a
manner
that
was
not
one
whit
the
wiser
upon
which
he
was
struck
dumb
confounded
and
stood
as
motionless
as
a
statue
in
the
mean
while
swill
down
whole
bumpers
told
a
hundred
merry
tales
and
swore
a
thousand
times
over
that
he
was
the
happiest
creature
upon
earth
persuading
to
be
as
merry
and
thoughtless
as
himself
at
last
being
gradually
overcome
by
the
fumes
of
his
liquor
he
fell
fast
asleep
spent
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
deep
contemplation
and
in
all
the
uneasiness
of
mind
imaginable
what
said
he
the
king
first
became
crazy
and
then
was
murder
i
think
i
have
just
grounds
for
complaint
the
whole
empire
is
in
confusion
and
torn
to
pieces
and
this
is
as
happy
as
a
king
o
fortune
o
fate
a
highwayman
as
happy
as
a
monarch
and
the
most
amiable
creature
that
nature
ever
fram
has
suffer
perhaps
an
ignominious
death
or
perhaps
is
in
a
state
of
life
a
thousand
times
worse
than
death
itself
o
astarte
what
art
thou
become
as
soon
as
it
was
break
of
day
he
went
out
and
ask
every
one
he
saw
if
they
knew
any
thing
of
her
but
the
whole
gang
were
too
intent
upon
other
matters
to
return
him
any
answer
by
virtue
of
their
night
excursions
they
had
brought
in
some
fresh
booty
and
were
busy
in
dividing
the
spoil
all
the
favour
he
could
procure
in
their
hurry
and
tumult
was
to
go
away
without
the
least
examination
he
took
the
advantage
of
their
remissness
and
off
the
premises
but
more
overwhelm
with
grief
and
deep
reflection
than
ever
in
his
march
was
very
restless
and
uneasy
his
thoughts
were
forever
rolling
on
the
unfortunate
the
king
of
his
the
happy
the
fair
that
was
taken
prisoner
on
the
confines
of
by
the
courier
in
a
word
on
the
various
scenes
of
misfortunes
and
disappointments
which
he
had
successively
met
with
chap
xiv
fisherman
when
had
travelled
some
few
leagues
from
castle
he
found
himself
arriv
at
the
banks
of
a
little
river
incessantly
deploring
as
he
went
along
his
unhappy
fate
and
looking
upon
himself
as
the
very
picture
of
ill
luck
he
perceiv
at
a
little
distance
a
fisherman
reclin
on
a
verdant
bank
by
the
trembling
scarce
able
to
hold
his
net
in
his
hand
which
he
but
little
to
regard
and
with
uplift
eyes
imploring
assistance
i
am
doubtless
said
the
poor
fisherman
the
most
unhappy
wretch
that
ever
liv
no
merchant
in
all
it
is
very
well
known
was
ever
so
noted
for
selling
as
myself
and
yet
i
am
ruin
to
all
intents
and
purposes
no
man
of
my
profession
ever
had
a
handsomer
more
compleat
housewife
than
my
dame
was
but
i
have
been
treacherously
depriv
of
her
i
had
still
left
a
poor
pitiful
cottage
but
that
i
saw
plunder
and
destroy
i
am
cubb
up
here
in
a
cell
i
have
nothing
to
depend
upon
but
my
fishery
and
not
one
single
fish
have
i
caught
thou
unfortunate
net
i
never
throw
thee
into
the
water
more
much
sooner
will
i
throw
myself
in
no
sooner
were
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
but
he
started
up
and
ran
to
the
like
one
that
was
resolutely
bent
to
plunge
in
and
get
rid
of
a
miserable
life
at
once
is
it
possible
said
is
there
then
the
man
in
being
more
wretched
than
myself
his
benevolence
and
good
will
to
save
the
poor
man
life
was
as
quick
as
the
reflection
he
had
just
made
he
ran
to
his
assistance
he
laid
hold
of
him
and
ask
him
with
an
air
of
pity
and
concern
the
cause
of
his
rash
intention
is
an
old
saying
that
a
person
is
less
unhappy
when
he
sees
himself
not
singular
in
misfortune
but
if
we
will
credit
this
is
not
from
a
principle
of
malignity
but
the
effect
of
a
fatal
necessity
he
was
attracted
as
it
were
to
any
person
in
distress
as
being
one
in
the
same
unhappy
circumstances
the
transport
of
a
happy
man
would
be
a
kind
of
insult
but
two
persons
in
bad
circumstances
are
like
two
weak
shrubs
which
by
propping
up
each
other
are
fenc
against
a
storm
why
are
you
thus
cast
down
said
to
the
fisherman
never
sink
man
under
the
weight
of
your
burden
i
ca
help
it
said
the
poor
fisherman
i
have
not
the
least
prospect
of
redress
i
was
once
sir
the
man
of
the
whole
village
of
near
where
i
liv
and
with
the
help
of
my
wife
made
the
best
that
were
ever
eaten
in
the
empire
her
majesty
the
queen
and
the
famous
were
very
fond
of
them
i
serv
the
court
with
about
six
hundred
of
them
i
went
the
other
day
in
hopes
of
being
paid
but
before
i
had
well
got
into
the
suburbs
of
i
was
inform
that
not
only
the
queen
but
too
had
privately
left
the
court
whereupon
i
ran
directly
to
house
tho
i
never
sat
eye
on
the
man
in
all
my
life
there
i
found
the
of
the
grand
plundering
by
virtue
of
his
majesty
mandate
all
his
effects
in
the
most
loyal
manner
from
thence
i
made
the
best
of
my
way
to
the
queen
kitchin
where
applying
my
self
to
the
steward
of
her
household
and
his
inferior
officers
one
of
them
told
me
she
was
dead
another
that
she
was
confin
in
prison
a
third
indeed
said
that
she
had
made
her
escape
by
flight
all
in
general
however
assur
me
for
my
comfort
that
my
cheeses
would
never
be
paid
for
from
thence
i
went
with
my
wife
in
my
hand
to
lord
who
was
another
of
my
of
whom
we
for
shelter
and
protection
the
favour
i
confess
was
readily
granted
to
my
wife
but
as
for
my
own
part
i
was
absolutely
rejected
she
was
fairer
sir
than
the
fairest
cheese
i
ever
sold
from
whence
i
date
all
my
misfortunes
and
the
red
that
adorn
her
blushing
cheeks
was
ten
times
more
lively
than
any
scarlet
and
between
you
and
i
sir
that
was
the
main
cause
of
my
reception
and
my
disgrace
whereupon
i
wrote
a
doleful
letter
to
my
wife
in
all
the
agonies
of
one
in
the
deepest
despair
is
very
well
said
she
to
the
messenger
i
have
some
little
knowledge
of
the
man
i
have
heard
say
no
one
sells
better
than
he
does
desire
him
next
time
he
comes
to
bring
a
small
parcel
with
him
and
let
him
know
i
take
care
he
shall
be
punctually
paid
in
the
height
of
my
misfortunes
i
determin
to
seek
redress
in
a
court
of
equity
i
had
but
six
ounces
of
gold
left
two
whereof
went
for
a
fee
to
my
counsellor
two
to
my
lawyer
who
took
my
cause
in
hand
and
the
other
two
to
the
judge
clerk
notwithstanding
what
i
had
done
my
cause
was
not
so
much
as
commenc
and
i
had
already
disburs
more
money
than
all
my
cheeses
and
my
wife
with
them
were
worth
i
return
therefore
to
my
native
habitation
with
a
full
resolution
to
sell
it
for
the
ransom
of
my
wife
my
little
cot
with
the
appurtenances
were
worth
about
threescore
ounces
of
gold
but
as
the
purchasers
found
i
was
necessitous
and
drove
to
my
last
shifts
the
first
whom
i
apply
to
offer
me
thirty
ounces
the
second
twenty
and
the
third
but
ten
just
as
i
had
come
to
terms
of
accommodation
with
one
of
them
the
prince
of
came
to
and
swept
all
before
him
my
little
cottage
with
all
its
furniture
was
first
plunder
of
all
that
was
valuable
and
at
last
reduc
to
ashes
having
thus
lost
my
money
my
wife
and
my
house
i
withdrew
to
this
desart
where
you
see
me
i
have
since
endeavour
to
get
my
bread
by
fishing
but
the
fish
as
well
as
all
mankind
desert
me
i
scarce
catch
one
in
a
day
i
am
half
starv
and
had
it
not
been
for
your
unexpected
benevolence
and
generosity
i
had
been
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
before
this
this
long
detail
of
particulars
however
was
not
deliver
without
several
interruptions
for
said
with
abundance
of
warmth
and
confusion
have
you
never
heard
sir
of
what
is
become
of
the
queen
no
sir
not
i
said
the
disconsolate
fisherman
but
this
i
know
to
my
sorrow
that
neither
the
queen
nor
ever
paid
me
the
least
consideration
in
the
world
for
my
cream
cheeses
that
my
dear
spouse
is
taken
from
me
and
that
i
am
drove
to
the
very
brink
of
despair
i
am
verily
persuaded
said
that
you
will
not
lose
all
your
money
i
have
heard
much
talk
of
that
same
they
say
he
is
very
honest
and
that
if
ever
he
returns
to
as
is
to
be
hop
he
will
he
discharge
his
debts
with
interest
like
a
man
of
honour
but
as
for
your
wife
who
appears
to
me
to
be
no
better
than
a
never
take
the
trouble
if
you
take
my
advice
to
hunt
after
her
any
more
be
rul
and
make
the
best
of
your
way
to
i
shall
be
there
before
you
as
i
shall
ride
and
you
will
be
on
foot
make
your
applications
to
the
illustrious
tell
him
you
met
his
friend
upon
the
road
and
stay
there
still
i
come
observe
my
orders
and
very
probable
it
may
turn
out
to
your
advantage
o
puissant
continu
he
you
have
made
me
is
true
an
instrument
of
comfort
to
this
poor
man
but
what
friend
will
you
raise
for
me
to
alleviate
my
sorrows
having
utter
this
short
expostulation
he
gave
the
distrest
fisherman
one
full
moiety
of
all
the
money
he
brought
with
him
out
of
the
fisherman
and
transported
with
joy
at
so
unexpected
a
benefaction
kiss
the
feet
of
friend
and
cried
out
sure
you
are
a
messenger
of
heaven
sent
down
to
be
my
saviour
in
the
mean
time
every
now
and
then
ask
him
questions
and
wept
as
he
ask
them
what
sir
said
the
fisherman
can
you
who
are
so
bountiful
a
benefactor
be
in
distress
yourself
alas
said
he
friend
i
am
a
hundred
times
more
unhappy
than
thou
art
but
pray
sir
said
the
good
man
how
can
it
possibly
be
that
he
who
is
so
lavish
of
his
favours
should
be
overwhelm
with
greater
misfortunes
than
the
man
he
so
generously
relieves
your
greatest
uneasiness
said
he
arose
from
the
narrowness
of
your
circumstances
but
mine
proceeds
from
an
internal
and
much
deeper
cause
pray
sir
said
the
fisherman
has
robb
you
of
your
wife
this
interrogatory
put
in
a
moment
upon
a
retrospection
of
all
his
past
adventures
he
recollected
the
whole
series
of
his
misfortunes
commencing
from
that
of
the
eunuch
and
the
huntsman
to
his
arrival
at
the
castle
alas
said
he
to
the
fisherman
is
true
deserves
severely
to
be
punish
but
for
the
generality
we
find
such
worthless
barbarians
are
the
favourites
of
fortune
be
that
however
as
it
will
go
as
i
bade
you
to
my
friend
and
wait
there
till
i
come
they
took
their
leave
the
fisherman
blessing
his
propitious
stars
and
cursing
every
step
he
went
the
hour
he
was
born
chap
xv
basilisk
as
was
traversing
a
verdant
meadow
he
perceiv
several
young
female
intent
on
searching
for
something
very
curious
that
lay
conceal
as
they
imagin
in
the
grass
he
took
the
freedom
to
approach
one
of
them
and
ask
her
in
the
most
courteous
manner
if
he
might
have
the
honour
to
assist
her
in
her
researches
have
a
care
said
she
what
we
are
hunting
after
sir
is
an
animal
that
will
not
suffer
itself
to
be
touch
by
a
man
is
somewhat
surprizing
said
may
i
be
so
bold
pray
as
to
ask
you
what
you
are
in
pursuit
after
that
shuns
the
touch
of
any
thing
but
the
hands
of
the
fair
sex
is
sir
said
she
the
a
madam
said
he
and
pray
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
inform
me
with
what
view
are
you
searching
after
a
creature
so
very
difficult
to
be
met
with
is
sir
said
she
for
our
lord
and
master
whose
castle
you
see
situate
on
the
at
the
bottom
of
the
meadow
we
are
all
his
vassals
you
must
know
is
in
a
very
bad
state
of
health
and
his
first
physician
has
order
him
as
a
specific
to
eat
a
boil
in
rose
water
and
as
that
animal
is
very
hard
to
be
catch
and
will
suffer
nothing
to
approach
it
but
one
of
our
sex
our
dying
sovereign
has
promis
to
honour
her
that
shall
be
so
happy
as
to
catch
it
for
him
so
far
as
to
make
her
his
consort
the
case
being
thus
circumstantiated
sir
i
hope
you
will
not
interrupt
me
any
longer
lest
my
rivals
here
in
the
field
should
happen
to
circumvent
me
withdrew
and
left
the
ladies
in
quest
of
their
imaginary
booty
in
order
to
pursue
his
intended
journey
but
as
he
came
to
the
banks
of
a
rivulet
at
the
remotest
part
of
the
meadow
he
perceiv
another
young
lady
reclin
on
the
grass
and
entirely
disengag
her
stature
seem
majestic
but
her
face
was
with
a
vail
and
her
eyes
were
fixt
as
one
at
her
on
the
river
every
now
and
then
a
sigh
burst
out
as
if
her
heart
were
breaking
in
her
hand
she
held
a
little
wand
or
rod
with
which
she
was
tracing
out
some
characters
on
the
dry
sand
that
lay
between
the
bank
she
sat
on
and
the
purling
current
curiosity
induc
him
unperceiv
to
observe
her
operations
at
some
distance
but
approaching
nearer
and
perceiving
very
distinctly
the
first
character
to
be
an
the
next
an
and
the
third
a
he
started
but
when
he
saw
the
additional
capitals
of
and
his
astonishment
was
too
great
for
words
to
express
he
stood
for
some
time
perfectly
and
as
motionless
as
a
statue
at
last
in
a
soft
faultring
tone
he
broke
silence
o
generous
lady
said
he
forgive
a
stranger
one
overwhelm
with
sorrows
like
yourself
if
he
asks
you
by
what
amazing
accident
he
finds
the
name
of
delineated
by
so
angelick
a
hand
thus
unexpectedly
interrupted
and
at
the
sound
of
those
words
she
turn
her
head
and
with
a
trembling
hand
lifting
up
her
vail
she
espy
himself
upon
which
she
shriek
and
as
her
heart
was
flutter
between
the
two
extreams
of
transport
and
surprize
she
fainted
away
and
gently
dropp
into
his
arms
was
it
seems
her
self
was
the
queen
of
was
the
very
whom
ador
was
in
short
the
very
identical
lady
whose
hard
fate
he
had
so
long
deplor
and
for
whose
sake
he
had
felt
so
many
agonizing
pains
for
a
few
minutes
he
stood
speechless
and
depriv
as
it
were
of
all
his
senses
whilst
his
eyes
were
fixt
on
his
who
began
to
revive
and
cast
a
wishful
glance
at
him
attended
with
some
confusion
o
ye
immortal
powers
cried
he
who
preside
over
the
destiny
of
us
frail
mortals
ye
have
restor
me
my
but
alas
at
what
a
conjuncture
in
what
a
place
and
in
what
a
state
and
condition
do
i
view
her
he
threw
himself
prostrate
on
the
ground
and
kiss
the
dust
of
her
feet
the
queen
of
rais
him
up
and
oblig
him
to
sit
by
her
on
the
bank
whereon
she
was
repos
every
now
and
then
she
wip
her
eyes
as
the
tears
trickl
down
afresh
her
lovely
cheeks
twenty
times
she
endeavour
to
renew
her
discourse
but
was
interrupted
by
her
sighs
she
ask
him
over
and
over
to
relate
to
her
the
hardships
he
had
ran
thro
since
their
parting
and
by
what
chance
he
came
to
traverse
that
solitary
meadow
but
prevented
him
at
the
same
time
from
returning
any
answer
by
repeating
question
upon
question
at
last
she
gave
him
a
particular
detail
of
her
own
misfortunes
and
again
requested
to
know
his
both
of
them
in
short
having
in
some
measure
appeas
the
tumult
of
their
souls
in
a
few
words
inform
her
of
the
motives
that
brought
him
thither
but
tell
me
o
unfortunate
tho
queen
how
i
came
to
find
you
out
reclining
on
this
verdant
bank
dress
in
this
servile
habit
accompanied
by
other
female
slaves
who
i
find
have
been
all
day
long
in
quest
after
a
which
as
i
understand
is
by
order
of
a
celebrated
physician
to
be
in
as
a
specific
medicine
for
his
dying
patient
whilst
they
busy
in
their
fruitless
search
said
the
beauteous
i
tell
you
the
whole
series
of
sorrows
which
i
have
undergone
since
last
we
parted
and
since
has
thus
unexpectedly
blest
my
eyes
once
more
with
the
sight
of
my
dear
i
no
longer
exclaim
against
my
impropitious
stars
you
are
not
insensible
that
the
jealous
king
my
spouse
was
disgusted
to
find
you
the
most
amiable
of
all
mortals
and
that
for
no
other
reason
he
determin
to
strangle
you
and
poison
me

know
very
well
too
that
indulgent
inspir
as

my
little
dwarf
with
artful
means
to
give
me
timely
notice
of
the
rash
resolutions
of
the
king
my
cruel
husband
no
sooner
had
the
faithful

you
to
obey
my
orders
and
to
fly

court

my
apartment

the
dead
of
night
thro
a
private
door

snatch
me
up
and

directly
into

temple
of

holy

was
his
brother

up
in
that
august
and
awful
statue

stands
erect
upon
the
pavement
of
the
temple

lofty
ceiling

time

venerable
and
loyal

break
of
day
into
my
apartment
with
a
potion
in
his
hand

officious

both
as
perfidious
traitors

your
self

that
too
in
the
presence
and
by
the
express
order
of
my
royal
master

they
had
no
other
marks
to
distinguish
me
from
others
but
my
stature
as
it
had
been

a
young
lady
just
of
my
size
but
in
all
probability
much
more
handsome
presented
herself
to
their
view
on
the
frontiers
of
she
was
found
alone
and
in
a
very
disconsolate
condition
this
lady
must
doubtless
said
they
to
themselves
be
the
queen
of
and
without
listning
to
her
complaints
convey
her
instantly
to
my
husband
their
gross
blunder
at
first
incens
his
majesty
to
the
last
degree
but
after
he
had
view
the
lady
with
an
attentive
eye
he
found
she
was
extremely
pretty
and
was
soon
pacify
her
name
was
i
have
been
since
inform
that
her
name
in
the
language
signifies
the
and
in
effect
she
was
so
she
had
as
much
art
however
as
caprice
for
she
pleas
the
king
of
kings
in
short
she
had
such
an
ascendancy
over
him
that
he
did
scruple
in
publick
to
own
her
as
his
wife
when
she
had
secur
him
thus
far
in
her
toils
she
never
conceal
her
power
but
play
the
part
of
a
perfect
humourist
she
indulg
herself
in
every
whim
that
came
in
her
head
without
fear
of
being
in
the
first
place
she
insisted
that
the
chief
magus
who
was
old
and
gouty
should
dance
a
saraband
before
her
and
upon
his
modest
refusal
to
comply
with
so
preposterous
a
request
she
persecuted
him
without
mercy
nothing
would
serve
her
turn
in
the
next
place
but
his
majesty
grand
master
of
the
horse
must
make
her
a
the
gentleman
took
the
liberty
to
let
her
know
that
he
was
no
profess
cook
a
tart
however
he
must
make
for
her
and
she
got
him
turn
out
of
his
place
for
being
so
monstrously
careless
as
to
burn
one
of
the
crust
whereupon
she
gave
his
post
to
her
favourite
dwarf
and
made
her
fop
of
a
page
the
keeper
of
his
majesty
great
seal
and
confidence
thus
she
reign
arbitrary
and
was
the
female
tyrant
of
all
the
world
deplor
the
loss
of
me
their
former
queen
the
king
who
never
acted
the
part
of
a
tyrant
till
the
moment
he
would
have
imprison
me
and
strangled
you
seem
to
have
all
his
good
qualities
in
his
dotage
on
that
capricious
enchantress
he
came
to
the
temple
on
the
solemn
festival
of
the
sacred
fire
i
saw
him
prostrate
on
the
pavement
before
the
statue
wherein
i
was
enclos
imploring
the
gods
to
down
their
choicest
blessings
on
his
beauteous
i
with
an
audible
and
distinct
but
hollow
tone
address
my
self
thus
like
an
oracle
to
the
king
of
kings
gods
reject
the
vows
of
a
monarch
that
acts
the
tyrant
his
subjects
one
who
could
think
of
murdering
an
innocent
wife
and
admit
of
a
worthless
beauty
to
supply
her
was
so
startled
at
this
unexpected
answer
from
the
god
he
ador
that
he
was
just
at
the
point
of
distraction
the
oracle
that
i
had
deliver
and
the
tyrannical
proceedings
of
his
new
spouse
were
enough
to
deprive
him
of
his
senses
in
short
in
a
few
days
he
became
a
perfect
her
caprice
which
seem
a
judgement
from
above
portended
a
sudden
revolution
his
subjects
accordingly
revolted
and
were
instantly
up
in
arms
that
had
so
long
indulg
herself
in
indolence
and
ease
became
the
seat
or
theatre
of
a
bloody
civil
war
whereupon
i
was
taken
from
my
magnificent
prison
the
bowels
of
his
god
and
set
up
at
the
head
of
a
very
powerful
party
your
friend
flew
to
in
hopes
to
find
you
there
and
bring
you
back
to
the
prince
of
hearing
of
these
intestine
broils
return
with
a
powerful
army
in
order
to
form
a
third
party
among
the
he
attack
the
king
who
fled
with
his
fair
but
fickle
before
him
however
was
so
closely
pursu
that
he
dy
of
the
wounds
he
receiv
in
his
retreat
became
the
fair
victim
of
the
conqueror
as
for
my
own
part
i
had
the
misfortune
to
be
likewise
and
taken
prisoner
by
an
who
brought
me
into
the
presence
of
the
young
prince
at
the
very
juncture
when
stood
before
him
you
smile
doubtless
when
i
tell
you
the
prince
look
upon
me
as
the
most
amiable
captive
of
the
two
but
then
i
presume
you
will
be
sorry
to
hear
that
my
hard
fate
me
to
be
a
vassal
in
his
seraglio
he
told
me
in
direct
terms
that
as
soon
as
he
had
put
an
happy
issue
to
one
military
expedition
which
would
not
he
flatter
himself
be
long
unexecuted
he
would
honour
me
with
a
visit
judge
the
dreadful
apprehensions
i
was
under
upon
his
making
such
a
peremptory
declaration
my
obligations
to
were
all
cancell
and
i
was
free
to
be
the
bride
of
but
instead
of
that
i
fell
into
the
toils
of
a
i
answer
him
with
all
the
resentment
becoming
one
of
my
high
character
and
unspotted
virtue
i
had
always
heard
say
that
bestow
on
persons
of
my
rank
such
a
peculiar
mark
of
majesty
and
grandeur
that
with
a
bare
word
or
the
glance
of
an
angry
eye
they
could
bring
down
and
abase
the
pride
of
those
audacious
creatures
that
durst
to
thwart
their
inclinations
i
talk
as
big
as
a
queen
but
i
was
treated
like
the
most
servile
domestic
the
saucy
without
so
much
as
vouchsafing
me
one
single
word
turn
to
his
black
eunuch
and
told
him
that
i
was
very
impertinent
but
yet
he
could
not
help
thinking
i
was
very
pretty
he
gave
him
therefore
particular
orders
to
take
care
of
me
and
put
me
under
the
same
regimen
with
respect
to
my
diet
as
one
of
his
favourites
in
order
that
i
might
recover
my
colour
which
was
somewhat
too
languid
in
a
word
that
i
might
become
worthy
in
a
little
time
of
his
royal
favours
and
be
duely
qualified
to
receive
him
when
he
should
honour
me
so
far
as
to
fix
the
day
i
told
him
i
would
die
first
he
replied
with
a
sneer
that
young
ladies
like
me
seldom
kill
themselves
and
that
they
were
made
for
enjoyment
and
then
turn
upon
his
heel
with
as
careless
an
air
as
a
man
would
part
with
his
paroquet
when
he
had
shut
her
up
close
in
her
gilded
cage
what
a
shocking
state
was
i
in
for
the
first
queen
of
the
universe
nay
i
say
more
for
a
heart
that
was
wholly
devoted
to
her
at
these
endearing
words
threw
himself
at
her
feet
and
bath
them
with
his
tears
immediately
rais
him
in
the
most
courteous
and
engaging
manner
and
thus
continu
her
i
too
plainly
perceiv
that
i
was
subject
to
the
tyranny
of
a
and
the
rival
of
a
coquet
that
was
a
slave
like
myself
she
related
to
me
all
her
past
adventures
in
from
the
description
she
gave
of
her
gallant
the
time
and
place
the
dromedary
he
was
mounted
on
and
from
every
other
minute
circumstance
i
imagin
it
was
your
self
that
play
the
hero
in
her
favour
as
i
made
no
doubt
but
that
you
resided
somewhere
in
i
determin
to
go
thither
my
self
but
in
disguise
beauteous
said
i
you
are
of
a
much
sprightlier
disposition
than
i
am
you
will
be
able
to
amuse
the
gay
young
prince
of
a
thousand
times
better
than
i
shall
find
out
some
way
therefore
for
my
escape
by
which
you
will
be
sole
lady
regent
you
will
oblige
me
to
the
last
degree
by
your
friendly
assistance
and
at
the
same
time
get
rid
of
a
rival
cajol
with
the
hint
came
into
my
measures
directly
she
took
care
to
send
me
packing
forthwith
with
no
other
attendant
than
an
old
slave
no
sooner
had
i
reach
the
borders
of
but
a
notorious
one
by
name
pick
me
up
as
i
was
strolling
along
and
sold
me
to
some
merchants
who
convey
me
to
yonder
castle
the
magnificent
residence
of
the
emir
he
purchas
me
at
all
adventures
without
enquiring
what
or
who
i
was
he
is
a
perfect
debauchee
his
sole
delight
lies
in
good
eating
wine
and
women
and
is
one
who
imagines
that
the
almighty
sent
him
into
the
world
for
no
other
purpose
but
to
gratify
his
unruly
appetites
he
is
excessively
fat
and
puffs
and
blows
every
moment
like
one
half
choak
when
he
has
gorg
himself
so
unmercifully
that
he
is
ready
to
burst
his
chief
physician
can
persuade
him
to
take
any
thing
for
his
relief
tho
he
laughs
at
him
and
despises
his
advice
when
he
well
and
sober
he
has
intimated
to
him
that
at
present
his
life
in
danger
and
nothing
will
restore
him
but
a
boil
in
whereupon
the
grand
has
promis
his
last
favours
to
that
slave
whoever
she
be
that
shall
be
so
fortunate
as
to
catch
a
for
him
since
it
seems
they
are
so
seldom
to
be
met
with
you
see
i
have
others
to
struggle
for
the
honour
propos
and
i
never
had
a
less
inclination
to
find
out
this
than
at
present
since
i
have
once
more
met
with
my
dearest
after
this
declaration
and
renew
with
warmth
the
virtuous
affection
which
they
had
long
conceiv
for
each
other
and
reciprocally
utter
all
the
tenderest
expressions
that
love
in
distress
could
possibly
devise
and
the
who
preside
over
all
the
soft
passions
wafted
their
mutual
vows
of
eternal
constancy
and
truth
to
the
sphere
of
the
whole
train
of
slaves
after
a
long
fruitless
search
attended
on
to
inform
him
that
all
their
strictest
search
was
fruitless
desired
that
he
might
have
the
honour
to
be
introduc
into
his
presence
accordingly
he
was
and
his
address
was
to
this
or
the
like
effect
may
immortal
health
descend
from
heaven
to
preserve
a
life
sir
so
precious
as
yours
is
i
am
a
physician
by
profession
i
flew
to
your
palace
on
the
first
news
of
the
dangerous
situation
you
were
in
and
have
brought
a
with
me
distill
in
i
can
have
no
hopes
of
the
honour
of
your
bed
in
case
i
succeed
in
my
application
all
the
favour
i
request
is
the
release
of
one
of
your
slaves
who
has
been
in
your
highness
retinue
for
some
time
and
i
am
willing
to
be
your
in
her
stead
if
i
fail
of
restoring
the
most
illustrious
and
magnificent
to
his
pristine
state
of
health
the
proposition
was
readily
embrac
was
instantly
discharg
and
set
out
for
with
a
proper
attendant
according
to
direction
assuring
her
that
she
should
hear
every
day
by
a
special
courier
of
his
proceedings
with
his
new
patient
the
farewel
which
they
took
of
each
other

very
affectionate
and
tender
expressive
of
the
strongest
obligations
to
each

the
moments
of
meeting
and
those
of

as
it

written
in
the
sacred
book
of
the
two
most
remarkable
of

repeated
protestations
of
affection
for
the
queen
were
perfectly
sincere
and
the
pure
dictates
of
his
heart
and
the

made
a
deeper
impression
on
hers

the
fatigue
the
second
day

not

so
irksome

better
at

you
the
important

these
eight
days
successively

all

that
there
is
no
such
animal
in
nature
as
a
that
health
is
to
be
secur
by
temperance
and
exercise
and
that
the
art
of
making
health
consistent
with
luxury
is
altogether
as
impracticable
and
an
art
in
all
respects
as
idle
and
chimerical
as
those
of

judicial
astrology
or
any
other
reveries
of

airy
and
fantastic
nature
apprehensive
that
this
unexpected
cure
thus
wrought
by
a
stranger
through
such
an
preparation
might
possibly
not
only
render
himself
the
object
of
contempt
in
the
eye
of
his
great
master
but
cast
a
kind
of
slur
in
general
on
his
whole
fraternity
conven
a
set
of
petty
doctors
and
apothecaries
who
were
his
vassals
and
entirely
devoted
to
his
interest
to
find
out
some
sure
ways
and
means
to
cut
off
in

his
dreadful

of
so
illustrious

so
beautiful
a

that
had
run
thro
such
a
long
series
of
misfortunes
at
that
time
seem
to
be
perfectly
serene
and
quiet
as
for
the
young

victors

at

that

would
exert
both
his
courage

her
sake
beyond

besought
the

concealing
at

time
both
his

required
and
accordingly
withdrew
to
the

that
was
provided
for
him
according
to
his
lot
who
was
just

to
having
hunted
all
over
to
no

in
hopes
to
find
his
friend
brought
a
compleat
set
of
armour
into
his
lodge
by
express
orders
from
the
queen

sent
him
likewise
one
of
the
finest
horses
in
all
knew
that
these
presents
could
come
from

which
redoubled
his
vigour
and
his
hopes
the
next
morning

queen
being
seated
under

with
precious
stones
and
the
amphitheatres
being
crowded
with
gentlemen

and
conditions
from

that
of

first
that
advanc
was
a
grandee
one
by
name
immensely
rich
indeed
and
very
haughty
but
no
ways
couragious
exceedingly
awkward
and
a
man
of
no
acquir

the
sycophants
that
hover
round
about
him
flatter
him
that
a
man
of
his
merit
could
fail
of
being
king
he
imperiously
replied
one
of
my
merit
must
be
king
whereupon
he
was
arm
his
armour
was
made
of
pure
gold
with
green
the
housings
of
his
saddle
were
green
and
his
lance
embellish
with
green
ribbands
every
one
was
sensible
at
first
sight
by
manner
of
managing
his
horse
that
he
was
not
the
man
whom
had
pitch
upon
to
sway
the
scepter
the
first
combatant
that
tilted
with
him
threw
him
out
of
the
saddle
the
second
flung
him
quite
over
the
crupper
and
laid
him
sprawling
on
the
ground
with
his
heels
in
the
air
is
true
remounted
but
with
so
ill
a
grace
that
an
universal
laugh
went
round
the
amphitheatre
the
third
disdaining
to
use
his
lance
made
only
a
feint
at
him
then
catch
hold
of
his
right
leg
and
whirling
him
round
threw
him
flat
upon
the
sand
the
esquires
who
were
the
attendants
ran
to
his
assistance
and
with
a
sneer
remounted
him
the
fourth
combatant
catch
hold
of
his
left
leg
and
unhors
him
again
he
was
convey
thro
the
hissing
multitude
to
his
lodge
where
according
to
the
law
in
that
case
provided
he
was
to
pass
the
night
and
as
he
hobbled
along
said
he
to
the
esquires
what
a
sad
misfortune
is
this
to
one
of
my
birth
and
character
the
other
champions
play
their
parts
much
better
and
all
came
off
with
credit
some
conquer
two
of
their
antagonists
and
others
were
so
far
successful
as
to
get
the
better
of
three
none
of
them
however
except
prince
vanquish
four
at
last
enter
the
lists
and
dismounted
all
his
four
opponents
one
after
the
other
with
the
utmost
ease
and
with
such
an
air
and
grace
as
gain
him
universal
applause
as
the
case
stood
thus
and
were
to
close
the
day
entertainment
in
a
single
combat
the
armour
of
the
latter
was
of
a
blue
colour
mixt
with
gold
and
the
housings
of
his
saddle
were
of
the
same
those
of
the
former
white
as
snow
the
multitude
were
divided
in
their
wishes
the
knight
in
blue
was
the
favourite
of
some
of
the
ladies
and
others
again
were
admirers
of
the
cavalier
in
white
the
queen
whose
heart
was
in
a
perfect
palpitation
put
up
her
secret
prayers
to
to
assist
her
darling
hero
the
two
champions
making
their
passes
and
their
volta
with
the
utmost
dexterity
and
address
and
keeping
firm
in
their
saddles
gave
each
other
such
rebuffs
with
their
lances
that
all
the
spectators
the
queen
only
excepted
wish
for
two
kings
of
at
last
their
horses
being
tired
and
both
their
lances
broke
made
use
of
the
following
stratagem
which
his
antagonist
was
any
ways
appriz
of
he
got
artfully
behind
him
and
shooting
with
a
spring
on
his
horses
buttocks
grasp
him
close
threw
him
headlong
on
the
sand
then
jump
into
his
seat
and
wheel

while
he
lay
sprawling
on
the
ground
all
the
spectators
in

acclamations

the
last
degree
got
up
and
drew
his
sword
sprang
from
his
horse
with
his
sabre
in
his
hand
now
behold
the
two
chieftains
upon
their
legs
commencing
a
new
trial
of
skill
where
they
seem
to
get
the
better
of
each
other
alternately
for
both
were
strong
and
both
were
active
the
feathers
of
their
helmets
the
studs
of
their
bracelets
their
coats
of
mail
flew
about
in
pieces
thro
the
dry
blows
which
they
a
thousand
times
repeated
they
struck
at
each
other
sometimes
with
the
edge
of
their
swords
at
other
times
they
push
as
occasion
offer
now
on
the
right
then
on
the
left
now
on
the
head
then
at
the
breast
they
retreated
they
advanc
they
kept
at
a
distance
they
again
they
grasp
each
other
turning
and
twisting
like
two
serpents
and
engag
each
other
as
fiercely
as
two
lions
fighting
for
their
prey
their
swords
struck
fire
almost
at
every
blow
at
last
in
order
to
recover
his
breath
for
a
moment
or
two
stood
still
and
afterwards
making
a
feint
at
the
prince
threw
him
on
his
back
and
disarm
him
thereupon
cried
out
o
thou
knight
of
the
white
armour
is
you
only
are
to
be
the
king
of
the
queen
was
perfectly
transported
the
two
champions
were
reconducted
to
their
separate
lodges
as
the
others
had
been
before
them
in
conformity
to
the
laws
prescrib
several
mutes
were
order
to
wait
on
the
champions
and
carry
them
some
proper
refreshment
we
leave
the
reader
to
judge
whether
the
queen
dwarf
was
not
appointed
to
wait
on
on
this
happy
occasion
after
supper
the
mutes
withdrew
and
left
the
combatants
to
rest
their
wearied
limbs
till
the
next
morning
at
which
time
the
victor
was
to
produce
his
before
the
in
order
to
confer
notes
and
discover
the
hero
whoever
he
might
be
slept
very
sound
notwithstanding
his
amorous
regard
for
the
queen
being
perfectly
fatigu
who
lay
in
the
lodge
contiguous
to
his
could
not
once
close
his
eyes
for
vexation
he
got
up
therefore
in
the
dead
of
the
night
stole
imperceptibly
into
apartment
took
his
white
armour
and
device
away
with
him
and
substituted
his
green
one
in
its
place
as
soon
as
the
day
began
to
dawn
he
repair
with
a
seemingly
undaunted
courage
to
the
to
inform
him
that
he
was
the
mighty
hero
the
happy
victor
without
the
least
hesitation
he
gain
his
point
and
was

victor
before
was
awake

at
this
unexpected
disappointment
return
with
a
heart
overwhelm
with
despair
to
the
court
of
almost
all
the
spectators
were
mov
off
from
the
amphitheatre
before
wak
he
hunted
for
his
arms
but
could
find
nothing
but
those
in
green
he
was
oblig
tho
sorely
against
his
will
to
put
it
on
having
nothing
else
in
his
lodge
to
appear
in
confounded
and
big
with
resentment
he
drest
himself
and
made
his
personal
appearance
in
that
despicable
equipage
the
populace
that
were
left
behind
in
the
hiss
him
every
step
he
took
they
made
a
ring
about
him
and
treated
him
with
all
the
marks
of
ignominy
and
contempt
the
most
cowardly
wretch
breathing
was
never
sure
so
sweated
or
hunted
down
as
poor
he
grew
quite
out
of
patience
at
last
and
cut
his
way
thro
the
insulting
mob
with
his
rival
sabre
but
he
did
not
know
what
measures
to
pursue
or
how
to
rectify
so
gross
a
mistake
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
have
a
sight
of
the
queen
he
could
never
recover
the
white
armour
again
which
she
had
sent
him
that
was
the
compromise
or
the
engagement
to
which
the
combatants
had
all
unanimously
agreed
thus
as
he
was
on
the
one
hand
plung
in
an
abyss
of
sorrow
so
on
the
other
he
was
almost
drove
distracted
with
vexation
and
resentment
he
withdrew
therefore
in
a
solitary
mood
to
the
banks
of
the
now
fully
persuaded
that
his
impropitious
star
had
shed
its
most
baleful
influence
on
him
and
that
his
misfortunes
were
irretrievable
revolving
in
his
mind
all
his
disappointments
from
his
first
adventure
with
the
who
had
an
utter
aversion
to
a
blind
eye
down
to
his
late
loss
of
his
white
armour
see
said
he
the
fatal
consequence
of
being
a
sluggard
had
i
been
more
vigilant
i
had
been
king
of
but
what
is
more
i
had
been
happy
in
the
embraces
of
my
dearest
all
the
knowledge
of
books
or
mankind
all
the
personal
valour
that
i
can
boast
of
has
only
prov
an
aggravation
of
my
sorrows
he
carried
the
point
so
far
at
last
as
to
murmur
at
the
unequal
dispensations
of
divine
providence
and
was
tempted
to
believe
that
all
occurrences
were
govern
by
a
malignant
destiny
which
never
fail
to
oppress
the
virtuous
and
always
crown
the
actions
of
such
villains
as
the
green
knight
with
uncommon
success
in
one
of
his
frantick
fits
he
put
on
the
green
armour
that
had
created
him
such
a
world
of
disgrace
a
merchant
happening
to
pass
by
he
sold
it
to
him
for
a
trifle
and
took
in
exchange
nothing
more
than
a
mantle
and
a
cap
in
this
disguise
he
took
a
solitary
walk
along
the
banks
of
the
every
minute
reflecting
in
his
mind
on
the
partial
proceedings
of
providence
which
never

torment

as
was
travelling
along

met
with
a
hermit

and
venerable
beard
descended
to
his
girdle

had
in
his
hand
a
little
book
on
which
his
eyes
were
fix
threw
himself
in
his
way
and
made
him
a
profound
bow
the
hermit
return
the
compliment
with
such
an
air
of
majesty
and
benevolence
that
curiosity
prompted
him
to
converse
with
so
agreeable
a
stranger

hermit

look
at
it

the
book
into
the
hands
of
who

he
was
a
perfect
master
of
several
languages

decypher
one
single
character

curiosity

the
good
father
to
him
alas
i
have
cause
enough

if
you
permit
me
to
accompany
you
said
the
old
hermit
perhaps
i
may
be
of
some
service
to
you

have
sometimes

sentiments
of
consolation
into
the
minds
of
the
afflicted

a
secret
regard
for
the
air
of
the
old
man
for
his
beard
and
his
book
he
found
by
conversing
with
him
that
he
was
the
most
learned
person
he
had
ever
met
with
the
hermit
harangu
on
destiny
justice
morality
the
sovereign
good
the
frailty
of
nature
on
virtue
and
vice
in
such
a
lively
manner
and
in
such
a
flow
of
words
that
was
attach
to
him
by
an
invincible
charm
he
earnestly
that
he
would
favour
him
with
his
company
to
that
favour

was
going
to
ask

the
old
man

to
me
by
that
you
wo
leave
me
for
some
days
at
least
let
me
do
what
i
please
took
the
oath
requir
and
both
pursu
their
journey
the
two
travellers
arriv
that
evening
at
a
superb
castle
the
hermit
begg
for
an
hospitable
reception
of
himself
and
his
young
comrade
the
porter
whom
any
one
might
have
taken
for
some
grandee
let
them
in
but
with
a
kind
of
coldness
and
contempt
however
he
conducted
them
to
the
who
went
with
them
thro
every
rich
apartment
of
his
master
house
they
were
seated
at
supper
afterwards
at
the
lower
end
indeed
of
the
table
and
where
they
were
taken
little
or
no
notice
of
by
the
host
but
they
were
with
as
much
delicacy
and
profusion
as
any
of
the
other
guests
when
they
arose
from
table
they
wash
their
hands
in
a
golden
bason
set
with
emeralds
and
other
costly
stones
when
was
time
to
go
to
rest
they
were
conducted
into
a
richly
furnish
and
the
next
morning
two
pieces
of
gold
were
presented
to
him
for
their
mutual
service
by
a
valet
in
waiting
and
then
they
were
dismiss
the
proprietor
of
this
castle
said
as
they
were
upon
the
road
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
hospitable
gentleman
tho
somewhat
too
haughty
indeed
and
too
imperious
the
words
were
no
sooner
out
of
his
mouth
but
he
perceiv
that
the
pocket
of
his
garment
tho
very
large
was
swell
and
greatly
extended
he
soon
saw
what
was
the
cause
and
that
he
had
clandestinely
brought
off
the
golden
laver
he
durst
not
immediately
take
notice
of
the
fact
but
was
ready
to
sink
at
the
very
thoughts
o
about
noon
the
hermit
rapp
at
a
petty
cottage
with
his
staff
the
beggarly
residence
of
an
old
rich
miser
he
desir
that
he
and
his
companion
might
refresh
themselves
there
for
a
few
hours
an
old
shabby
domestick
let
them
in
indeed
but
with
visible
reluctance
and
carried
them
into
the
stable
where
all
their
fare
was
a
few
musty
olives
and
a
draught
or
two
of
sower
small
beer
the
hermit
seem
as
content
with
his
repast
as
he
was
the
night
before
at
last
rising
off
from
his
seat
he
paid
his
compliments
to
the
old
valet
who
had
as
watchful
an
eye
over
them
all
the
time
as
if
they
had
been
a
brace
of
thieves
and
intimated
every
now
and
then
that
he
fear
they
would
be
benighted
and
gave
him
the
two
pieces
of
gold
he
had
but
just
receiv
that
morning
as
a
token
of
his
gratitude
for
his
courteous
entertainment
he
added
moreover
i
would
willingly
speak
one
word
with
your
master
before
i
go
the
valet
at
his
unexpected
gratuity
comply
with
his
request
most
hospitable
sir
said
the
hermit
i
could
go
away
without
returning
you
my
grateful
acknowledgments
for
the
friendly
reception
we
have
met
with
this
afternoon
be
pleas
to
accept
this
golden
bason
as
a
small
token
of
my
gratitude
and
esteem
the
miser
started
and
was
ready
to
fall
down
backwards
at
the
sight
of
so
valuable
a
present
the
hermit
gave
him
no
time
to
recover
out
of
his
surprise
but
march
off
that
moment
with
his
young
comrade
father
said
what
is
all
this
that
i
have
seen
you
seem
to
me
to
act
in
a
quite
different
manner
from
the
generality
of
mankind
you
plunder
one
who
entertain
you
with
all
the
pomp
and
profusion
in
the
world
to
enrich
a
covetous
sordid
wretch
who
treated
you
in
the
most
unworthy
manner
son
said
the
old
man
that
grandee
who
receives
visits
of
strangers
with
no
other
view
than
to
gratify
his
pride
and
to
raise
their
astonishment
at
the
furniture
of
his
palace
will
henceforward
learn
to
be
wiser
and
the
miser
to
be
more
liberal
for
the
time
to
come
do
be
surpris
but
follow
me
was
at
a
stand
at
present
and
could
well
determine
whether
his
companion
was
a
man
of
greater
wisdom
than
ordinary
or
a
but
the
hermit
assum
such
an
ascendency
over
him
exclusive
of
the
oath
he
had
taken
that
he
could
tell
how
to
leave
him
at
night
they
came
to
a
house
very
commodiously
built
but
neat
and
plain
where
nothing
was
wanting
and
yet
nothing
profuse
the
master
was
a
philosopher
that
had
retir
from
the
busy
world
in
order
to
live
in
peace
and
form
his
mind
to
virtue
he
was
pleas
to
build
this
little
box
for
the
reception
of
strangers
in
a
handsome
manner
but
without
ostentation
he
came
in
person
to
meet
them
at
the
door
and
for
a
time
advis
them
to
sit
down
and
rest
themselves
in
a
commodious
apartment
after
some
respite
he
invited
them
to
a
frugal
yet
elegant
repast
during
which
he
talk
very
intelligently
about
the
late
revolutions
in
he
seem
entirely
to
be
in
the
queen
interest
and
heartily
wish
that
had
entred
the
lists
for
the
regal
prize
but
said
he
do
deserve
a
king
of
so
much
merit
a
modest
blush
appear
in
face
at
this
unexpected
compliment
which
innocently
aggravated
his
misfortunes
it
was
agreed
on
all
hands
that
the
affairs
of
this
world
took
sometimes
a
quite
different
turn
from
what
the
wisest
patriots
would
wish
them
the
hermit
replied
the
ways
of
providence
are
often
very
intricate
and
obscure
and
men
were
much
to
blame
for
casting
reflections
on
the
conduct
of
the
whole
upon
the
bare
inspection
of
the
minutest
part
the
next
topick
they
entred
upon
was
the
passions
alas
said
how
fatal
in
their
consequences
however
said
the
hermit
they
are
the
winds
that
swell
the
sail
of
the
vessel
sometimes
true
they
overset
it
but
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sailing
without
them
phlegm
indeed
makes
men
peevish
and
sick
but
then
there
is
no
living
without
it
tho
every
thing
here
below
is
dangerous
yet
all
are
necessary
in
the
next
place
their
discourse
turn
on
sensual
pleasures
and
the
hermit
demonstrated
that
they
were
the
gifts
of
heaven
for
said
he
man
can
not
bestow
either
sensations
or
ideas
on
himself
he
receives
them
all
his
pain
and
pleasure
as
well
as
his
being
proceed
from
a
superior
cause
stood
astonish
to
think
how
a
man
that
had
committed
such
vile
actions
could
argue
so
well
on
such
moral
topicks
at
the
proper
hour
after
an
entertainment
not
only
instructive
but
way
agreeable
their
host
conducted
them
to
their
thanking
heaven
for
directing
two
such
polite
and
virtuous
strangers
to
his
house
he
offer
them
at
the
same
time
some
silver
to
defray
their
expences
on
the
road
but
with
such
an
air
of
respect
and
benevolence
that
was
impossible
to
give
the
least
disgust
the
hermit
however
refus
it
and
took
his
leave
as
he
to
set
forward
for
by
break
of
day
their
parting
was
very
affectionate
and
friendly
in
particular
express
a
more
than
common
regard
for
a
man
of
so
amiable
a
behaviour
when
the
hermit
and
he
were
alone
and
preparing
for
bed
they
talk
long
in
praise
of
their
new
host
as
soon
as
appear
the
old
hermit
wak
his
young
comrade
is
time
to
be
gone
said
he
but
as
all
the
house
are
fast
asleep
i
leave
a
token
behind
me
of
my
respect
and
affection
for
the
master
of
it
no
sooner
were
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
but
he
struck
a
light
kindled
a
torch
and
set
the
building
in
a
flame
in
the
utmost
confusion
out
and
would
if
possible
have
prevented
him
from
being
guilty
of
such
a
monstrous
act
of
ingratitude
the
hermit
dragg
him
away
by
a
superior
force
the
house
was
soon
in
a
blaze
when
they
had
got
at
a
convenient
distance
the
hermit
with
an
amazing
sedateness
turn
back
and
survey
the
destructive
flames
behold
said
he
our
fortunate
friend
in
the
ruins
he
will
find
an
immense
treasure
that
will
enable
him
from
henceforth
to
exert
his
beneficence
and
render
his
virtues
more
and
more
conspicuous
tho
astonish
to
the
last
degree
attended
him
to
their
last
stage
which
was
to
the
cottage
of
a
very
virtuous
and
widow
who
had
a
nephew
of
about
fourteen
years
of
age
he
was
a
hopeful
youth
and
the
darling
of
her
heart
she
entertain
her
two
guests
with
the
best
provisions
her
little
house
afforded
in
the
morning
she
order
her
nephew
to
attend
them
to
an
adjacent
bridge
which
having
been
broken
down
some
few
days
before
render
the
passage
dangerous
to
strangers
the
lad
being
very
attentive
to
wait
on
them
went
formost
when
they
were
got
upon
the
bridge
come
hither
my
pretty
boy
said
the
hermit
i
must
give
your
aunt
some
small
token
of
my
respect
for
her
last
night
favours
upon
that
he
twisted
his
fingers
in
the
hair
of
his
head
and
threw
him
very
calmly
into
the
river
down
went
the
little
lad
he
came
up
once
again
to
the
surface
of
the
water
but
was
soon
lost
in
the
rapid
stream
o
thou
monster
thou
worst
of
villains
cry
did
you
promise
said
the
hermit
to
view
my
conduct
with
patience
know
then
that
had
that
boy
but
one
year
longer
he
would
have
murder
his
who
told
you
so
you
barbarous
wretch
said
and
when
did
you
read
that
inhuman
event
in
your
of
who
gave
you
permission
pray
to
drown
so
innocent
a
youth
that
had
never
disoblig
you
no
sooner
had
our
young
ceas
his
severe
reflections
but
he
perceiv
that
the
old
hermit
long
beard
grew
shorter
and
shorter
that
the
furrows
in
his
face
began
to
fill
up
and
that
his
cheeks
glow
with
a
red
as
if
he
had
been
in
the
bloom
of
fifteen
his
mantle
was
vanish
at
once
and
on
his
shoulders
which
were
before
cover
appear
four
angelic
wings
each
refulgent
as
the
sun
o
thou
messenger
of
heaven
o
thou
angelic
form
cry
and
fell
prostrate
at
his
feet
thou
art
descended
from
the
empireum

find
to
instruct
such
a
poor
frail
mortal
as
i
am
how
to
submit
to
the
mysteries
of
fate
mankind
in
general
said
the
angel
judge
of
the
whole
by
only
viewing
the

of
the

of
all
the
human
race
wast
the
only
man
that
deserv

thy

i
am
somewhat
diffident
of
myself
true
but
may
i
presume
sir
to
beg
the
solution
of
one
scruple
would
it
not
have
been
better
to
have
chastiz
the
lad
and
by
that
means
reform
him
than
to
have
cut
him
off
thus
unprepar
in
a

he
been
virtuous
and
had
he
liv

his
not
only
to

himself

his
wife
whom
he
would
afterwards
have
married
and
the
little
infant
that
was
to
have
been
the
pledge
of
their
mutual
affection
is
it
necessary
then
venerable
guide
that
there
should
be
wickedness
and
misfortunes
in
the
world
and
that
those
misfortunes
should
fall
with
weight
on
the
heads
of
the
righteous
the
wicked
replied
are
always
unhappy
misfortunes
are
intended
only
as
a
to
try
a
small
number
of

this
terrestrial
globe
besides
there
is
no

under

some

proceeds
from
it
but
said
suppose
the
world
was
all
goodness
and
there
was
no
such
thing
in
nature
as
evil
then
that
world
of
yours
said

be
another
world
the
chain
of

would
be
another

that
other

whatever

ænigmas
or
riddles
as
one
beside
himself
and
perfectly
beat
his
march
at
random
he
entred
however
into
the
city
of
on
that
very
day
when
those
combatants
who
had
been
before
in
the
list
or
circus
were
already
assembled
in
the
spacious
of
the
palace
in
order
to
solve
the
ænigmas
and
give
the
wisest
answers
they
could
to
such
questions
as
the
should
propose
all
the
parties
concern
were
present
except
the
knight
of
the
green
armour
no
sooner
had
made
his
appearance
in
the
city
but
the
populace
flock
round
about
him
no
eye
was
satisfied
with
gazing
at
him
all
in
general
were
lavish
of
their
praises
and
in
their
hearts
wish
him
their
sovereign
except
the
envious
man
who
as
he
pass
by
fetch
a
deep
sigh
and
turn
his
head
aside
the
populace
with
loud
acclamations
attended
him
to
the
the
queen
who
had
heard
of
his
arrival
was
in
the
utmost
agony
between
hope
and
despair
her
vexation
had
almost
brought
her
to
death
door
she
could
conceive
why
should
appear
without
his
accoutrements
nor
imagine
which
way
could
procure
the
armour
at
the
sight
of
a
confus
murmur
ran
thro
the
whole
place
every
eye
was
surpriz
tho
charm
at
the
same
time
to
see
him
again
but
then
none
were
to
be
admitted
into
the
except
the
knights
i
have
fought
as
successfully
as
any
one
of
them
all
said
tho
another
appears
clad
in
my
armour
but
in
the
mean
time
before
i
can
possibly
prove
my
assertion
i
insist
upon
being
admitted
into
court
in
order
to
give
my
solutions
to
such
ænigmas
as
shall
be
propos
was
put
to
the
vote
as
the
reputation
of
his
being
a
man
of
the
strictest
honour
and
veracity
was
so
strongly
imprinted
on
their
minds
the
motion
of
his
admittance
was
carried
in
the
affirmative
without
the
least
opposition
the
first
question
the
propos
was
this
what
is
the
longest
and
yet
the
shortest
thing
in
the
world
the
most
swift
and
the
most
slow
the
most
divisible
and
the
most
extended
the
least
valu
and
the
most
regretted
and
without
which
nothing
can
possibly
be
done
which
in
a
word
devours
every
thing
how
minute
soever
and
yet
gives
life
and
spirit
to
every
object
or
being
however
great
had
the
honour
to
answer
first
his
reply
was
that
a
man
of
his
merit
had
something
else
to
think
on
than
idle
riddles
enough
for
him
that
he
was
acknowledg
the
hero
of
the
circus
one
said
the
solution
of
the
ænigma
propos
was
others
said
the
and
others
again
the
but
pronounced
it
to
be
nothing
said
he
can
be
longer
since
the
measure
of
eternity
nothing
is
shorter
since
there
is
time
always
wanting
to
accomplish
what
we
aim
at
nothing
passes
so
slowly
as
time
to
him
who
is
in
expectation
and
nothing
so
swift
as
time
to
him
who
is
in
the
perfect
enjoyment
of
his
wishes
extent
is
to
infinity
in
the
whole
and
divisible
to
infinity
in
part
all
men
neglect
it
in
the
passage
and
all
regret
the
loss
of
it
when
is
past
nothing
can
possibly
be
done
without
it
it
buries
in
oblivion
whatever
is
unworthy
of
being
transmitted
down
to
posterity
and
it
renders
all
illustrious
actions
immortal
the
assembly
agreed
unanimously
that
was
in
the
right
the
next
question
that
was
started
was
what
is
the
thing
we
receive
without
being
ever
thankful
for
it
which
we
enjoy
without
knowing
how
we
came
by
it
which
we
give
away
to
others
without
knowing
where
is
to
be
found
and
which
we
lose
without
being
any
ways
conscious
of
our
misfortune
each
pass
his
verdict
was
the
only
person
that
concluded
it
was
life
he
solv
every
ænigma
propos
with
equal
facility
when
he
heard
the
explications
always
said
that
nothing
in
the
world
was
more
easy
than
to
solve
such
obvious
questions
and
that
he
could
interpret
a
thousand
of
them
without
the
least
hesitation
were
he
inclin
to
trouble
his
head
about
such
trifles
other
questions
were
propos
in
regard
to
justice
the
sovereign
good
and
the
art
of
government
answers
still
carried
the
greatest
weight
what
pity
is
said
some
who
were
present
that
one
of
so
comprehensive
a
genius
should
make
such
a
scurvy
cavalier
most
illustrious
grandees
said
i
was
the
person
that
had
the
honour
of
being
victor
at
your
circus
the
white
armour
most
puissant
lords
was
mine
that
awkward
warrior
there
lord
dress
himself
in
it
whilst
i
was
asleep
he
imagin
it
is
plain
that
it
would
do
him
more
honour
than
his
own
green
one
unaccoutred
as
i
am
i
am
ready
before
this
august
assembly
to
give
them
incontestable
proof
of
my
superior
skill
to
engage
with
the
usurper
of
the
white
armour
with
my
sword
only
in
my
mantle
and
bonnet
and
to
testify
that
i
only
was
the
happy
victor
of
the
justly
admired
accepted
of
the
challenge
with
all
the
assurance
of
success
imaginable
he
did
not
doubt
but
being
properly
accoutred
with
his
helmet
his
cuirass
and
his
bracelets
he
should
be
able
to
hue
down
an
antagonist
in
his
mantle
and
cap
and
nothing
to
skreen
him
from
his
resentment
but
a
single
sabre
drew
his
sword
and
saluted
the
queen
with
it
who
view
him
with
transport
mix
with
fear
drew
his
but
paid
his
compliments
to
nobody
he
approach
as
one
whom
he
imagin
incapable
of
making
any
considerable
resistance
he
concluded
was
in
his
power
to
cut
into
atoms
however
knew
how
to
parry
the
blow
by
dexterously
receiving
it
upon
his
as
the
call
it
by
which
means
sword
was
snapt
in
two
with
that
in
an
instant
clos
his
adversary
and
by
his
superior
strength
as
well
as
skill
laid
him
sprawling
on
his
back
then
holding
the
point
of
his
sword
to
the
opening
of
his
cuirass
submit
to
be
stripp
of
your
borrow
plumes
or
you
are
a
dead
man
this
moment
always
surpriz
that
any
disappointment
should
attend
a
man
of
such
exalted
merit
as
himself
very
tamely
permitted
to
disrobe
him
by
degrees
of
his
pompous
helmet
his
superb
cuirass
his
rich
bracelets
his
brilliant
cuisses
or
armour
for
his
thighs
and
other
martial
accoutrements
when
had
equipp
himself
in
his
now
recover
armour
he
flew
to
and
threw
himself
prostrate
at
her
feet
prov
without
any
great
difficulty
that
the
white
armour
was
property
he
was
thereupon
acknowledg
king
of
by
the
unanimous
content
of
the
whole
court
but
more
particularly
with
the
approbation
of
who
after
such
a
long
series
of
misfortunes
now
tasted
the
sweets
of
seeing
her
darling
thought
worthy
in
the
opinion
of
the
whole
world
to
be
the
partner
of
her
royal
bed
withdrew
and
contented
himself
with
being
call
within
the
narrow
compass
of
his
own
domesticks
in
short
was
elected
king
and
was
as
happy
as
any
mortal
could
be
now
he
began
to
reflect
on
what
the
angel
had
said
to
him
nay
he
reflected
so
far
back
as
the
story
of
the
atom
of
dust
metamorphosed
into
a
diamond
the
queen
and
he
ador
the
divine
providence
permitted
the
fair
coquet
to
make
her
conquests
where
she
could
he
sent
couriers
to
