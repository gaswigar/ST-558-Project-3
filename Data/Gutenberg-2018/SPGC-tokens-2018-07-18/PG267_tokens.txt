the
touchstone
by
edith
wharton
i
professor
joslin
who
as
our
readers
are
doubtless
aware
is
engaged
in
writing
the
life
of
aubyn
asks
us
to
state
that
he
will
be
greatly
indebted
to
any
of
the
famous
novelist
s
friends
who
will
furnish
him
with
information
concerning
the
period
previous
to
her
coming
to
england
aubyn
had
so
few
intimate
friends
and
consequently
so
few
regular
correspondents
that
letters
will
be
of
special
value
professor
joslin
s
address
is
augusta
gardens
kensington
and
he
begs
us
to
say
that
he
will
promptly
return
any
documents
entrusted
to
glennard
dropped
the
spectator
and
sat
looking
into
the
fire
the
club
was
filling
up
but
he
still
had
to
himself
the
small
inner
room
with
its
darkening
outlook
down
the
prospect
of
fifth
avenue
it
was
all
dull
and
dismal
enough
yet
a
moment
earlier
his
boredom
had
been
perversely
tinged
by
a
sense
of
resentment
at
the
thought
that
as
things
were
going
he
might
in
time
have
to
surrender
even
the
despised
privilege
of
boring
himself
within
those
particular
four
walls
it
was
not
that
he
cared
much
for
the
club
but
that
the
remote
contingency
of
having
to
give
it
up
stood
to
him
just
then
perhaps
by
very
reason
of
its
insignificance
and
remoteness
for
the
symbol
of
his
increasing
abnegations
of
that
perpetual
that
was
gradually
reducing
existence
to
the
naked
business
of
keeping
himself
alive
it
was
the
futility
of
his
multiplied
shifts
and
privations
that
made
them
seem
unworthy
of
a
high
attitude
the
sense
that
however
rapidly
he
eliminated
the
superfluous
his
cleared
horizon
was
likely
to
offer
no
nearer
view
of
the
one
prospect
toward
which
he
strained
to
give
up
things
in
order
to
marry
the
woman
one
loves
is
easier
than
to
give
them
up
without
being
brought
appreciably
nearer
to
such
a
conclusion
through
the
open
door
he
saw
young
hollingsworth
rise
with
a
yawn
from
the
ineffectual
solace
of
a
and
transport
his
purposeless
person
to
the
window
glennard
measured
his
course
with
a
contemptuous
eye
it
was
so
like
hollingsworth
to
get
up
and
look
out
of
the
window
just
as
it
was
growing
too
dark
to
see
anything
there
was
a
man
rich
enough
to
do
what
he
pleased
had
he
been
capable
of
being
pleased
yet
barred
from
all
conceivable
achievement
by
his
own
impervious
dulness
while
a
few
feet
off
glennard
who
wanted
only
enough
to
keep
a
decent
coat
on
his
back
and
a
roof
over
the
head
of
the
woman
he
loved
glennard
who
had
sweated
toiled
denied
himself
for
the
scant
measure
of
opportunity
that
his
zeal
would
have
converted
into
a
kingdom
sat
wretchedly
calculating
that
even
when
he
had
resigned
from
the
club
and
knocked
off
his
cigars
and
given
up
his
sundays
out
of
town
he
would
still
be
no
nearer
attainment
the
spectator
had
slipped
to
his
feet
and
as
he
picked
it
up
his
eye
fell
again
on
the
paragraph
addressed
to
the
friends
of
aubyn
he
had
read
it
for
the
first
time
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
quickening
of
attention
her
name
had
so
long
been
public
property
that
his
eye
passed
it
unseeingly
as
the
crowd
in
the
street
hurries
without
a
glance
by
some
familiar
monument
information
concerning
the
period
previous
to
her
coming
to
england
the
words
were
an
evocation
he
saw
her
again
as
she
had
looked
at
their
first
meeting
the
poor
woman
of
genius
with
her
long
pale
face
and
eyes
softened
a
little
by
the
grace
of
youth
and
inexperience
but
so
incapable
even
then
of
any
hold
upon
the
pulses
when
she
spoke
indeed
she
was
wonderful
more
wonderful
perhaps
than
when
later
to
glennard
s
fancy
at
least
the
consciousness
of
memorable
things
uttered
seemed
to
take
from
even
her
most
intimate
speech
the
perfect
bloom
of
privacy
it
was
in
those
earliest
days
if
ever
that
he
had
come
near
loving
her
though
even
then
his
sentiment
had
lived
only
in
the
intervals
of
its
expression
later
when
to
be
loved
by
her
had
been
a
state
to
touch
any
man
s
imagination
the
physical
reluctance
had
inexplicably
so
overborne
the
intellectual
attraction
that
the
last
years
had
been
to
both
of
them
an
agony
of
conflicting
impulses
even
now
if
in
turning
over
old
papers
his
hand
lit
on
her
letters
the
touch
filled
him
with
inarticulate
misery
she
had
so
few
intimate
friends
that
letters
will
be
of
special
so
few
intimate
friends
for
years
she
had
had
but
one
one
who
in
the
last
years
had
requited
her
wonderful
pages
her
tragic
outpourings
of
love
humility
and
pardon
with
the
scant
phrases
by
which
a
man
evades
the
vulgarest
of
sentimental
importunities
he
had
been
a
brute
in
spite
of
himself
and
sometimes
now
that
the
remembrance
of
her
face
had
faded
and
only
her
voice
and
words
remained
with
him
he
chafed
at
his
own
inadequacy
his
stupid
inability
to
rise
to
the
height
of
her
passion
his
egoism
was
not
of
a
kind
to
mirror
its
complacency
in
the
adventure
to
have
been
loved
by
the
most
brilliant
woman
of
her
day
and
to
have
been
incapable
of
loving
her
seemed
to
him
in
looking
back
the
most
derisive
evidence
of
his
limitations
and
his
remorseful
tenderness
for
her
memory
was
complicated
with
a
sense
of
irritation
against
her
for
having
given
him
once
for
all
the
measure
of
his
emotional
capacity
it
was
not
often
however
that
he
thus
probed
the
past
the
public
in
taking
possession
of
aubyn
had
eased
his
shoulders
of
their
burden
there
was
something
fatuous
in
an
attitude
of
sentimental
apology
toward
a
memory
already
classic
to
reproach
one
s
self
for
not
having
loved
margaret
aubyn
was
a
good
deal
like
being
disturbed
by
an
inability
to
admire
the
venus
of
milo
from
her
cold
niche
of
fame
she
looked
down
ironically
enough
on
his
it
was
only
when
he
came
on
something
that
belonged
to
her
that
he
felt
a
sudden
renewal
of
the
old
feeling
the
strange
dual
impulse
that
drew
him
to
her
voice
but
drove
him
from
her
hand
so
that
even
now
at
sight
of
anything
she
had
touched
his
heart
contracted
painfully
it
happened
seldom
nowadays
her
little
presents
one
by
one
had
disappeared
from
his
rooms
and
her
letters
kept
from
some
unacknowledged
puerile
vanity
in
the
possession
of
such
treasures
seldom
came
beneath
his
hand
her
letters
will
be
of
special
value
her
letters
why
he
must
have
hundreds
of
them
enough
to
fill
a
volume
sometimes
it
used
to
seem
to
him
that
they
came
with
every
post
he
used
to
avoid
looking
in
his
when
he
came
home
to
his
rooms
but
her
writing
seemed
to
spring
out
at
him
as
he
put
his
key
in
the
door
he
stood
up
and
strolled
into
the
other
room
hollingsworth
lounging
away
from
the
window
had
joined
himself
to
a
languidly
convivial
group
of
men
to
whom
in
phrases
as
halting
as
though
they
struggled
to
define
an
ultimate
idea
he
was
expounding
the
cursed
nuisance
of
living
in
a
hole
with
such
a
damned
climate
that
one
had
to
get
out
of
it
by
february
with
the
contingent
difficulty
of
there
being
no
place
to
take
one
s
yacht
to
in
winter
but
that
other
hole
the
riviera
from
the
outskirts
of
this
group
glennard
wandered
to
another
where
a
voice
as
different
as
possible
from
hollingsworth
s
colorless
organ
dominated
another
circle
of
languid
listeners
come
and
hear
dinslow
talk
about
his
patent
admission
free
one
of
the
men
sang
out
in
a
tone
of
mock
resignation
dinslow
turned
to
glennard
the
confident
pugnacity
of
his
smile
give
it
another
six
months
and
it
ll
be
talking
about
itself
he
declared
it
s
pretty
nearly
articulate
can
it
say
papa
someone
else
inquired
dinslow
s
smile
broadened
you
ll
be
deuced
glad
to
say
papa
to
it
a
year
from
now
he
retorted
it
ll
be
able
to
support
even
you
in
affluence
look
here
now
just
let
me
explain
to
you
glennard
moved
away
impatiently
the
men
at
the
club
all
but
those
who
were
in
it
were
proverbially
tired
of
dinslow
s
patent
and
none
more
so
than
glennard
whose
knowledge
of
its
merits
made
it
loom
large
in
the
depressing
catalogue
of
lost
opportunities
the
relations
between
the
two
men
had
always
been
friendly
and
dinslow
s
urgent
offers
to
take
him
in
on
the
ground
floor
had
of
late
intensified
glennard
s
sense
of
his
own
inability
to
meet
good
luck
half
way
some
of
the
men
who
had
paused
to
listen
were
already
in
evening
clothes
others
on
their
way
home
to
dress
and
glennard
with
an
accustomed
twinge
of
humiliation
said
to
himself
that
if
he
lingered
among
them
it
was
in
the
miserable
hope
that
one
of
the
number
might
ask
him
to
dine
miss
trent
had
told
him
that
she
was
to
go
to
the
opera
that
evening
with
her
rich
aunt
and
if
he
should
have
the
luck
to
pick
up
a
he
might
join
her
there
without
extra
outlay
he
moved
about
the
room
lingering
here
and
there
in
a
tentative
affectation
of
interest
but
though
the
men
greeted
him
pleasantly
no
one
asked
him
to
dine
doubtless
they
were
all
engaged
these
men
who
could
afford
to
pay
for
their
dinners
who
did
not
have
to
hunt
for
invitations
as
a
beggar
rummages
for
a
crust
in
an
but
no
as
hollingsworth
left
the
lessening
circle
about
the
table
an
admiring
youth
called
out
holly
stop
and
dine
hollingsworth
turned
on
him
the
crude
countenance
that
looked
like
the
wrong
side
of
a
more
finished
face
sorry
i
can
t
i
m
in
for
a
beastly
glennard
threw
himself
into
an
why
go
home
in
the
rain
to
dress
it
was
folly
to
take
a
cab
to
the
opera
it
was
worse
folly
to
go
there
at
all
his
perpetual
meetings
with
alexa
trent
were
as
unfair
to
the
girl
as
they
were
unnerving
to
himself
since
he
couldn
t
marry
her
it
was
time
to
stand
aside
and
give
a
better
man
the
chance
and
his
thought
admitted
the
ironical
implication
that
in
the
terms
of
expediency
the
phrase
might
stand
for
hollingsworth
ii
he
dined
alone
and
walked
home
to
his
rooms
in
the
rain
as
he
turned
into
fifth
avenue
he
caught
the
wet
gleam
of
carriages
on
their
way
to
the
opera
and
he
took
the
first
side
street
in
a
moment
of
irritation
against
the
petty
restrictions
that
thwarted
every
impulse
it
was
ridiculous
to
give
up
the
opera
not
because
one
might
possibly
be
bored
there
but
because
one
must
pay
for
the
experiment
in
his
the
tacit
connivance
of
the
inanimate
had
centred
the
on
a
photograph
of
alexa
trent
placed
in
the
obligatory
silver
frame
just
where
as
memory
officiously
reminded
him
margaret
aubyn
s
picture
had
long
throned
in
its
stead
miss
trent
s
features
cruelly
justified
the
usurpation
she
had
the
kind
of
beauty
that
comes
of
a
happy
accord
of
face
and
spirit
it
is
not
given
to
many
to
have
the
lips
and
eyes
of
their
rarest
mood
and
some
women
go
through
life
behind
a
mask
expressing
only
their
anxiety
about
the
butcher
s
bill
or
their
inability
to
see
a
joke
with
miss
trent
face
and
mind
had
the
same
high
serious
contour
she
looked
like
a
throned
justice
by
some
grave
florentine
painter
and
it
seemed
to
glennard
that
her
most
salient
attribute
or
that
at
least
to
which
her
conduct
gave
most
consistent
expression
was
a
kind
of
passionate
justice
the
intuitive
feminine
justness
that
is
so
much
rarer
than
a
reasoned
impartiality
circumstances
had
tragically
combined
to
develop
this
instinct
into
a
conscious
habit
she
had
seen
more
than
most
girls
of
the
shabby
side
of
life
of
the
perpetual
tendency
of
want
to
cramp
the
noblest
attitude
poverty
and
misfortune
had
overhung
her
childhood
and
she
had
none
of
the
pretty
delusions
about
life
that
are
supposed
to
be
the
crowning
grace
of
girlhood
this
very
competence
which
gave
her
a
touching
reasonableness
made
glennard
s
situation
more
difficult
than
if
he
had
aspired
to
a
princess
bred
in
the
purple
between
them
they
asked
so
little
they
knew
so
well
how
to
make
that
little
do
but
they
understood
also
and
she
especially
did
not
for
a
moment
let
him
forget
that
without
that
little
the
future
they
dreamed
of
was
impossible
the
sight
of
her
photograph
quickened
glennard
s
exasperation
he
was
sick
and
ashamed
of
the
part
he
was
playing
he
had
loved
her
now
for
two
years
with
the
tranquil
tenderness
that
gathers
depth
and
volume
as
it
nears
fulfilment
he
knew
that
she
would
wait
for
him
but
the
certitude
was
an
added
pang
there
are
times
when
the
constancy
of
the
woman
one
can
not
marry
is
almost
as
trying
as
that
of
the
woman
one
does
not
want
to
glennard
turned
up
his
and
stirred
the
fire
he
had
a
long
evening
before
him
and
he
wanted
to
crowd
out
thought
with
action
he
had
brought
some
papers
from
his
office
and
he
spread
them
out
on
his
table
and
squared
himself
to
the
task
it
must
have
been
an
hour
later
that
he
found
himself
automatically
fitting
a
key
into
a
locked
drawer
he
had
no
more
notion
than
a
somnambulist
of
the
mental
process
that
had
led
up
to
this
action
he
was
just
dimly
aware
of
having
pushed
aside
the
papers
and
the
heavy
calf
volumes
that
a
moment
before
had
bounded
his
horizon
and
of
laying
in
their
place
without
a
trace
of
conscious
volition
the
parcel
he
had
taken
from
the
drawer
the
letters
were
tied
in
packets
of
thirty
or
forty
there
were
a
great
many
packets
on
some
of
the
envelopes
the
ink
was
fading
on
others
which
bore
the
english
it
was
still
fresh
she
had
been
dead
hardly
three
years
and
she
had
written
at
lengthening
intervals
to
the
last
he
undid
one
of
the
earlier
packets
little
notes
written
during
their
first
acquaintance
at
hillbridge
glennard
on
leaving
college
had
begun
life
in
his
uncle
s
law
office
in
the
old
university
town
it
was
there
that
at
the
house
of
her
father
professor
forth
he
had
first
met
the
young
lady
then
chiefly
distinguished
for
having
after
two
years
of
a
conspicuously
unhappy
marriage
returned
to
the
protection
of
the
paternal
roof
aubyn
was
at
that
time
an
eager
and
somewhat
tragic
young
woman
of
complex
mind
and
undeveloped
manners
whom
her
crude
experience
of
matrimony
had
fitted
out
with
a
stock
of
generalizations
that
exploded
like
bombs
in
the
academic
air
of
hillbridge
in
her
choice
of
a
husband
she
had
been
fortunate
enough
if
the
paradox
be
permitted
to
light
on
one
so
signally
gifted
with
the
faculty
of
putting
himself
in
the
wrong
that
her
leaving
him
had
the
dignity
of
a
manifesto
made
her
as
it
were
the
spokeswoman
of
outraged
wifehood
in
this
light
she
was
cherished
by
that
dominant
portion
of
hillbridge
society
which
was
least
indulgent
to
conjugal
differences
and
which
found
a
proportionate
pleasure
in
being
for
once
able
to
feast
openly
on
a
dish
liberally
seasoned
with
the
outrageous
so
much
did
this
endear
aubyn
to
the
university
ladies
that
they
were
disposed
from
the
first
to
allow
her
more
latitude
of
speech
and
action
than
the
wife
was
generally
accorded
in
hillbridge
where
misfortune
was
still
regarded
as
a
visitation
designed
to
put
people
in
their
proper
place
and
make
them
feel
the
superiority
of
their
neighbors
the
young
woman
so
privileged
combined
with
a
kind
of
personal
shyness
an
intellectual
audacity
that
was
like
a
deflected
impulse
of
coquetry
one
felt
that
if
she
had
been
prettier
she
would
have
had
emotions
instead
of
ideas
she
was
in
fact
even
then
what
she
had
always
remained
a
genius
capable
of
the
acutest
generalizations
but
curiously
undiscerning
where
her
personal
susceptibilities
were
concerned
her
psychology
failed
her
just
where
it
serves
most
women
and
one
felt
that
her
brains
would
never
be
a
guide
to
her
heart
of
all
this
however
glennard
thought
little
in
the
first
year
of
their
acquaintance
he
was
at
an
age
when
all
the
gifts
and
graces
are
but
so
much
undiscriminated
food
to
the
ravening
egoism
of
youth
in
seeking
aubyn
s
company
he
was
prompted
by
an
intuitive
taste
for
the
best
as
a
pledge
of
his
own
superiority
the
sympathy
of
the
cleverest
woman
in
hillbridge
was
balm
to
his
craving
for
distinction
it
was
public
confirmation
of
his
secret
sense
that
he
was
cut
out
for
a
bigger
place
it
must
not
be
understood
that
glennard
was
vain
vanity
contents
itself
with
the
coarsest
diet
there
is
no
palate
so
fastidious
as
that
of
to
a
youth
of
glennard
s
aspirations
the
encouragement
of
a
clever
woman
stood
for
the
symbol
of
all
success
later
when
he
had
begun
to
feel
his
way
to
gain
a
foothold
he
would
not
need
such
support
but
it
served
to
carry
him
lightly
and
easily
over
what
is
often
a
period
of
insecurity
and
discouragement
it
would
be
unjust
however
to
represent
his
interest
in
aubyn
as
a
matter
of
calculation
it
was
as
instinctive
as
love
and
it
missed
being
love
by
just
such
a
deflection
from
the
line
of
beauty
as
had
determined
the
curve
of
aubyn
s
lips
when
they
met
she
had
just
published
her
first
novel
and
glennard
who
afterward
had
an
ambitious
man
s
impatience
of
distinguished
women
was
young
enough
to
be
dazzled
by
the
it
gave
her
it
was
the
kind
of
book
that
makes
elderly
ladies
lower
their
voices
and
call
each
other
my
dear
when
they
furtively
discuss
it
and
glennard
exulted
in
the
superior
knowledge
of
the
world
that
enabled
him
to
take
as
a
matter
of
course
sentiments
over
which
the
university
shook
its
head
still
more
delightful
was
it
to
hear
aubyn
waken
the
echoes
of
academic
with
audacities
surpassing
those
of
her
printed
page
her
intellectual
independence
gave
a
touch
of
comradeship
to
their
intimacy
prolonging
the
illusion
of
college
friendships
based
on
a
joyous
interchange
of
heresies
aubyn
and
glennard
represented
to
each
other
the
augur
s
wink
behind
the
hillbridge
idol
they
walked
together
in
that
light
of
young
omniscience
from
which
fate
so
curiously
excludes
one
s
elders
husbands
who
are
notoriously
inopportune
may
even
die
inopportunely
and
this
was
the
revenge
that
aubyn
some
two
years
after
her
return
to
hillbridge
took
upon
his
injured
wife
he
died
precisely
at
the
moment
when
glennard
was
beginning
to
criticise
her
it
was
not
that
she
bored
him
she
did
what
was
infinitely
worse
she
made
him
feel
his
inferiority
the
sense
of
mental
equality
had
been
gratifying
to
his
raw
ambition
but
as
his
defined
itself
his
understanding
of
her
also
increased
and
if
man
is
at
times
indirectly
flattered
by
the
moral
superiority
of
woman
her
mental
ascendency
is
extenuated
by
no
such
oblique
tribute
to
his
powers
the
attitude
of
looking
up
is
a
strain
on
the
muscles
and
it
was
becoming
more
and
more
glennard
s
opinion
that
brains
in
a
woman
should
be
merely
the
obverse
of
beauty
to
beauty
aubyn
could
lay
no
claim
and
while
she
had
enough
prettiness
to
exasperate
him
by
her
incapacity
to
make
use
of
it
she
seemed
invincibly
ignorant
of
any
of
the
little
artifices
whereby
women
contrive
to
palliate
their
defects
and
even
to
turn
them
into
graces
her
dress
never
seemed
a
part
of
her
all
her
clothes
had
an
impersonal
air
as
though
they
had
belonged
to
someone
else
and
been
borrowed
in
an
emergency
that
had
somehow
become
chronic
she
was
conscious
enough
of
her
deficiencies
to
try
to
amend
them
by
rash
imitations
of
the
most
approved
models
but
no
woman
who
does
not
dress
well
intuitively
will
ever
do
so
by
the
light
of
reason
and
aubyn
s
plagiarisms
to
borrow
a
metaphor
of
her
trade
somehow
never
seemed
to
be
incorporated
with
the
text
genius
is
of
small
use
to
a
woman
who
does
not
know
how
to
do
her
hair
the
fame
that
came
to
aubyn
with
her
second
book
left
glennard
s
imagination
untouched
or
had
at
most
the
negative
effect
of
removing
her
still
farther
from
the
circle
of
his
contracting
sympathies
we
are
all
the
sport
of
time
and
fate
had
so
perversely
ordered
the
chronology
of
margaret
aubyn
s
romance
that
when
her
husband
died
glennard
felt
as
though
he
had
lost
a
friend
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
be
needlessly
unkind
and
though
he
was
in
the
impregnable
position
of
the
man
who
has
given
a
woman
no
more
definable
claim
on
him
than
that
of
letting
her
fancy
that
he
loves
her
he
would
not
for
the
world
have
accentuated
his
advantage
by
any
betrayal
of
indifference
during
the
first
year
of
her
widowhood
their
friendship
dragged
on
with
halting
renewals
of
sentiment
becoming
more
and
more
a
banquet
of
empty
dishes
from
which
the
covers
were
never
removed
then
glennard
went
to
new
york
to
live
and
exchanged
the
faded
pleasures
of
intercourse
for
the
comparative
novelty
of
correspondence
her
letters
oddly
enough
seemed
at
first
to
bring
her
nearer
than
her
presence
she
had
adopted
and
she
successfully
maintained
a
note
as
affectionately
impersonal
as
his
own
she
wrote
ardently
of
her
work
she
questioned
him
about
his
she
even
bantered
him
on
the
inevitable
pretty
girl
who
was
certain
before
long
to
divert
the
current
of
his
confidences
to
glennard
who
was
almost
a
stranger
in
new
york
the
sight
of
aubyn
s
writing
was
like
a
voice
of
reassurance
in
surroundings
as
yet
insufficiently
aware
of
him
his
vanity
found
a
retrospective
enjoyment
in
the
sentiment
his
heart
had
rejected
and
this
factitious
emotion
drove
him
once
or
twice
to
hillbridge
whence
after
scenes
of
evasive
tenderness
he
returned
dissatisfied
with
himself
and
her
as
he
made
room
for
himself
in
new
york
and
peopled
the
space
he
had
cleared
with
the
sympathies
at
the
disposal
of
agreeable
and
young
men
it
seemed
to
him
natural
to
infer
that
aubyn
had
refurnished
in
the
same
manner
the
void
he
was
not
unwilling
his
departure
should
have
left
but
in
the
dissolution
of
sentimental
partnerships
it
is
seldom
that
both
associates
are
able
to
withdraw
their
funds
at
the
same
time
and
glennard
gradually
learned
that
he
stood
for
the
venture
on
which
aubyn
had
irretrievably
staked
her
all
it
was
not
the
kind
of
figure
he
cared
to
cut
he
had
no
fancy
for
leaving
havoc
in
his
wake
and
would
have
preferred
to
sow
a
quick
growth
of
oblivion
in
the
spaces
wasted
by
his
unconsidered
inroads
but
if
he
supplied
the
seed
it
was
clearly
aubyn
s
business
to
see
to
the
raising
of
the
crop
her
attitude
seemed
indeed
to
throw
his
own
reasonableness
into
distincter
relief
so
that
they
might
have
stood
for
thrift
and
improvidence
in
an
allegory
of
the
affections
it
was
not
that
aubyn
permitted
herself
to
be
a
pensioner
on
his
bounty
he
knew
she
had
no
wish
to
keep
herself
alive
on
the
small
change
of
sentiment
she
simply
fed
on
her
own
funded
passion
and
the
luxuries
it
allowed
her
made
him
even
then
dimly
aware
that
she
had
the
secret
of
an
inexhaustible
alchemy
their
relations
remained
thus
negatively
tender
till
she
suddenly
wrote
him
of
her
decision
to
go
abroad
to
live
her
father
had
died
she
had
no
near
ties
in
hillbridge
and
london
offered
more
scope
than
new
york
to
her
expanding
personality
she
was
already
famous
and
her
laurels
were
yet
unharvested
for
a
moment
the
news
roused
glennard
to
a
jealous
sense
of
lost
opportunities
he
wanted
at
any
rate
to
reassert
his
power
before
she
made
the
final
effort
of
escape
they
had
not
met
for
over
a
year
but
of
course
he
could
not
let
her
sail
without
seeing
her
she
came
to
new
york
the
day
before
her
departure
and
they
spent
its
last
hours
together
glennard
had
planned
no
course
of
action
he
simply
meant
to
let
himself
drift
they
both
drifted
for
a
long
time
down
the
languid
current
of
reminiscence
she
seemed
to
sit
passive
letting
him
push
his
way
back
through
the
overgrown
channels
of
the
past
at
length
she
reminded
him
that
they
must
bring
their
explorations
to
an
end
he
rose
to
leave
and
stood
looking
at
her
with
the
same
uncertainty
in
his
heart
he
was
tired
of
her
already
he
was
always
tired
of
her
yet
he
was
not
sure
that
he
wanted
her
to
go
i
may
never
see
you
again
he
said
as
though
confidently
appealing
to
her
compassion
her
look
enveloped
him
and
i
shall
see
you
always
always
why
go
then
escaped
him
to
be
nearer
you
she
answered
and
the
words
dismissed
him
like
a
closing
door
the
door
was
never
to
reopen
but
through
its
narrow
crack
glennard
as
the
years
went
on
became
more
and
more
conscious
of
an
inextinguishable
light
directing
its
small
ray
toward
the
past
which
consumed
so
little
of
his
own
commemorative
oil
the
reproach
was
taken
from
this
thought
by
aubyn
s
gradual
translation
into
terms
of
universality
in
becoming
a
personage
she
so
naturally
ceased
to
be
a
person
that
glennard
could
almost
look
back
to
his
explorations
of
her
spirit
as
on
a
visit
to
some
famous
shrine
immortalized
but
in
a
sense
desecrated
by
popular
veneration
her
letters
from
london
continued
to
come
with
the
same
tender
punctuality
but
the
altered
conditions
of
her
life
the
vistas
of
new
relationships
disclosed
by
every
phrase
made
her
communications
as
impersonal
as
a
piece
of
journalism
it
was
as
though
the
state
the
world
indeed
had
taken
her
off
his
hands
assuming
the
maintenance
of
a
temperament
that
had
long
exhausted
his
slender
store
of
reciprocity
in
the
retrospective
light
shed
by
the
letters
he
was
blinded
to
their
specific
meaning
he
was
not
a
man
who
concerned
himself
with
literature
and
they
had
been
to
him
at
first
simply
the
extension
of
her
brilliant
talk
later
the
dreaded
vehicle
of
a
tragic
importunity
he
knew
of
course
that
they
were
wonderful
that
unlike
the
authors
who
give
their
essence
to
the
public
and
keep
only
a
dry
rind
for
their
friends
aubyn
had
stored
of
her
rarest
vintage
for
this
hidden
sacrament
of
tenderness
sometimes
indeed
he
had
been
oppressed
humiliated
almost
by
the
multiplicity
of
her
allusions
the
wide
scope
of
her
interests
her
persistence
in
forcing
her
superabundance
of
thought
and
emotion
into
the
shallow
receptacle
of
his
sympathy
but
he
had
never
thought
of
the
letters
objectively
as
the
production
of
a
distinguished
woman
had
never
measured
the
literary
significance
of
her
oppressive
prodigality
he
was
almost
frightened
now
at
the
wealth
in
his
hands
the
obligation
of
her
love
had
never
weighed
on
him
like
this
gift
of
her
imagination
it
was
as
though
he
had
accepted
from
her
something
to
which
even
a
reciprocal
tenderness
could
not
have
justified
his
claim
he
sat
a
long
time
staring
at
the
scattered
pages
on
his
desk
and
in
the
sudden
realization
of
what
they
meant
he
could
almost
fancy
some
alchemistic
process
changing
them
to
gold
as
he
stared
he
had
the
sense
of
not
being
alone
in
the
room
of
the
presence
of
another
self
observing
from
without
the
stirring
of
subconscious
impulses
that
sent
flushes
of
humiliation
to
his
forehead
at
length
he
stood
up
and
with
the
gesture
of
a
man
who
wishes
to
give
outward
expression
to
his
purpose
to
establish
as
it
were
a
moral
alibi
swept
the
letters
into
a
heap
and
carried
them
toward
the
grate
but
it
would
have
taken
too
long
to
burn
all
the
packets
he
turned
back
to
the
table
and
one
by
one
fitted
the
pages
into
their
envelopes
then
he
tied
up
the
letters
and
put
them
back
into
the
locked
drawer
iii
it
was
one
of
the
laws
of
glennard
s
intercourse
with
miss
trent
that
he
always
went
to
see
her
the
day
after
he
had
resolved
to
give
her
up
there
was
a
special
charm
about
the
moments
thus
snatched
from
the
jaws
of
renunciation
and
his
sense
of
their
significance
was
on
this
occasion
so
keen
that
he
hardly
noticed
the
added
gravity
of
her
welcome
his
feeling
for
her
had
become
so
vital
a
part
of
him
that
her
nearness
had
the
quality
of
imperceptibly
readjusting
his
point
of
view
so
that
the
jumbled
phenomena
of
experience
fell
at
once
into
a
rational
perspective
in
this
redistribution
of
values
the
sombre
retrospect
of
the
previous
evening
shrank
to
a
mere
cloud
on
the
edge
of
consciousness
perhaps
the
only
service
an
unloved
woman
can
render
the
man
she
loves
is
to
enhance
and
prolong
his
illusions
about
her
rival
it
was
the
fate
of
margaret
aubyn
s
memory
to
serve
as
a
foil
to
miss
trent
s
presence
and
never
had
the
poor
lady
thrown
her
successor
into
more
vivid
relief
miss
trent
had
the
charm
of
still
waters
that
are
felt
to
be
renewed
by
rapid
currents
her
attention
spread
a
tranquil
surface
to
the
demonstrations
of
others
and
it
was
only
in
days
of
storm
that
one
felt
the
pressure
of
the
tides
this
inscrutable
composure
was
perhaps
her
chief
grace
in
glennard
s
eyes
reserve
in
some
natures
implies
merely
the
locking
of
empty
rooms
or
the
dissimulation
of
awkward
encumbrances
but
miss
trent
s
reticence
was
to
glennard
like
the
closed
door
to
the
sanctuary
and
his
certainty
of
divining
the
hidden
treasure
made
him
content
to
remain
outside
in
the
happy
expectancy
of
the
neophyte
you
didn
t
come
to
the
opera
last
night
she
began
in
the
tone
that
seemed
always
rather
to
record
a
fact
than
to
offer
a
reflection
on
it
he
answered
with
a
discouraged
gesture
what
was
the
use
we
couldn
t
have
not
as
well
as
here
she
assented
adding
after
a
meditative
pause
as
you
didn
t
come
i
talked
to
aunt
virginia
ah
he
returned
the
fact
being
hardly
striking
enough
to
detach
him
from
the
contemplation
of
her
hands
which
had
fallen
as
was
their
wont
into
an
attitude
full
of
plastic
possibilities
one
felt
them
to
be
hands
that
moving
only
to
some
purpose
were
capable
of
intervals
of
serene
inaction
we
had
a
long
talk
miss
trent
went
on
and
she
waited
again
before
adding
with
the
increased
absence
of
stress
that
marked
her
graver
communications
aunt
virginia
wants
me
to
go
abroad
with
glennard
looked
up
with
a
start
abroad
when
now
next
month
to
be
gone
two
he
permitted
himself
a
movement
of
tender
derision
does
she
really
well
i
want
you
to
go
abroad
with
me
for
any
number
of
years
which
offer
do
you
accept
only
one
of
them
seems
to
require
immediate
consideration
she
returned
with
a
smile
glennard
looked
at
her
again
you
re
not
thinking
of
it
her
gaze
dropped
and
she
unclasped
her
hands
her
movements
were
so
rare
that
they
might
have
been
said
to
italicize
her
words
aunt
virginia
talked
to
me
very
seriously
it
will
be
a
great
relief
to
mother
and
the
others
to
have
me
provided
for
in
that
way
for
two
years
i
must
think
of
that
you
she
glanced
down
at
her
gown
which
under
a
renovated
surface
dated
back
to
the
first
days
of
glennard
s
wooing
i
try
not
to
cost
much
but
i
good
lord
glennard
groaned
they
sat
silent
till
at
length
she
gently
took
up
the
argument
as
the
eldest
you
know
i
m
bound
to
consider
these
things
women
are
such
a
burden
jim
does
what
he
can
for
mother
but
with
his
own
children
to
provide
for
it
isn
t
very
much
you
see
we
re
all
poor
your
aunt
isn
t
she
might
help
your
she
does
in
her
own
exactly
that
s
the
rich
relation
all
over
you
may
be
miserable
in
any
way
you
like
but
if
you
re
to
be
happy
you
ve
got
to
be
so
in
her
way
and
in
her
old
i
could
be
very
happy
in
aunt
virginia
s
old
gowns
miss
trent
interposed
abroad
you
mean
i
mean
wherever
i
felt
that
i
was
helping
and
my
going
abroad
will
of
course
i
see
that
and
i
see
your
considerateness
in
putting
its
advantages
negatively
in
dwelling
simply
on
what
the
going
will
take
you
from
not
on
what
it
will
bring
you
to
it
means
a
lot
to
a
woman
of
course
to
get
away
from
a
life
like
he
summed
up
in
a
disparaging
glance
the
background
of
indigent
furniture
the
question
is
how
you
ll
like
coming
back
to
she
seemed
to
accept
the
full
consequences
of
his
thought
i
only
know
i
don
t
like
leaving
he
flung
back
sombrely
you
don
t
even
put
it
conditionally
then
her
gaze
deepened
on
what
he
stood
up
and
walked
across
the
room
then
he
came
back
and
paused
before
her
on
the
alternative
of
marrying
the
slow
color
even
her
blushes
seemed
deliberate
rose
to
her
lower
lids
her
lips
stirred
but
the
words
resolved
themselves
into
a
smile
and
she
waited
he
took
another
turn
with
the
thwarted
step
of
the
man
whose
nervous
exasperation
escapes
through
his
muscles
and
to
think
that
in
fifteen
years
i
shall
have
a
big
practice
her
eyes
triumphed
for
him
in
less
the
cursed
irony
of
it
what
do
i
care
for
the
man
i
shall
be
then
it
s
slaving
one
s
life
away
for
a
stranger
he
took
her
hands
abruptly
you
ll
go
to
cannes
i
suppose
or
monte
carlo
i
heard
hollingsworth
say
that
he
meant
to
take
his
yacht
over
to
the
mediterranean
she
released
herself
if
you
think
that
i
don
t
i
almost
wish
i
did
it
would
be
easier
i
he
broke
off
incoherently
i
believe
your
aunt
virginia
does
though
she
somehow
connotes
hollingsworth
and
the
he
caught
her
hands
again
alexa
if
we
could
manage
a
little
hole
somewhere
out
of
town
could
we
she
sighed
half
yielding
in
one
of
those
places
where
they
make
jokes
about
the
mosquitoes
he
pressed
her
could
you
get
on
with
one
servant
could
you
get
on
without
varnished
boots
promise
me
you
won
t
go
then
what
are
you
thinking
of
stephen
i
don
t
know
he
stammered
the
question
giving
unexpected
form
to
his
intention
it
s
all
in
the
air
yet
of
course
but
i
picked
up
a
tip
the
other
day
you
re
not
speculating
she
cried
with
a
kind
of
superstitious
terror
lord
no
this
is
a
sure
thing
i
almost
wish
it
wasn
t
i
mean
if
i
can
work
it
he
had
a
sudden
vision
of
the
comprehensiveness
of
the
temptation
if
only
he
had
been
less
sure
of
dinslow
his
assurance
gave
the
situation
the
base
element
of
safety
i
don
t
understand
you
she
faltered
trust
me
instead
he
adjured
her
with
sudden
energy
and
turning
on
her
abruptly
if
you
go
you
know
you
go
free
he
concluded
she
drew
back
paling
a
little
why
do
you
make
it
harder
for
me
to
make
it
easier
for
myself
he
retorted
iv
glennard
the
next
afternoon
leaving
his
office
earlier
than
usual
turned
on
his
way
home
into
one
of
the
public
libraries
he
had
the
place
to
himself
at
that
closing
hour
and
the
librarian
was
able
to
give
an
undivided
attention
to
his
tentative
request
for
letters
collections
of
letters
the
librarian
suggested
walpole
i
meant
women
women
s
the
librarian
proffered
hannah
more
and
miss
martineau
glennard
cursed
his
own
inarticulateness
i
mean
letters
to
to
some
one
person
a
man
their
husband
or
ah
said
the
inspired
librarian
eloise
and
well
something
a
little
nearer
perhaps
said
glennard
with
lightness
didn
t
merimee
the
lady
s
letters
in
that
case
were
not
of
course
not
said
glennard
vexed
at
his
blunder
there
are
george
sand
s
letters
to
ah
glennard
hesitated
was
she
were
they
he
chafed
at
his
own
ignorance
of
the
sentimental
of
literature
if
you
want
perhaps
some
of
the
french
eighteenth
century
correspondences
might
suit
you
better
mlle
aisse
or
madame
de
sabran
but
glennard
insisted
i
want
something
modern
english
or
american
i
want
to
look
something
up
he
lamely
concluded
the
librarian
could
only
suggest
george
eliot
well
give
me
some
of
the
french
things
then
and
i
ll
have
merimee
s
letters
it
was
the
woman
who
published
them
wasn
t
it
he
caught
up
his
armful
transferring
it
on
the
doorstep
to
a
cab
which
carried
him
to
his
rooms
he
dined
alone
hurriedly
at
a
small
restaurant
near
by
and
returned
at
once
to
his
books
late
that
night
as
he
undressed
he
wondered
what
contemptible
impulse
had
forced
from
him
his
last
words
to
alexa
trent
it
was
bad
enough
to
interfere
with
the
girl
s
chances
by
hanging
about
her
to
the
obvious
exclusion
of
other
men
but
it
was
worse
to
seem
to
justify
his
weakness
by
dressing
up
the
future
in
delusive
ambiguities
he
saw
himself
sinking
from
depth
to
depth
of
sentimental
cowardice
in
his
reluctance
to
renounce
his
hold
on
her
and
it
filled
him
with
to
think
that
the
highest
feeling
of
which
he
supposed
himself
capable
was
blent
with
such
base
elements
his
awakening
was
hardly
cheered
by
the
sight
of
her
writing
he
tore
her
note
open
and
took
in
the
few
lines
she
seldom
exceeded
the
first
page
with
the
lucidity
of
apprehension
that
is
the
forerunner
of
evil
my
aunt
sails
on
saturday
and
i
must
give
her
my
answer
the
day
after
please
don
t
come
till
then
i
want
to
think
the
question
over
by
myself
i
know
i
ought
to
go
won
t
you
help
me
to
be
reasonable
it
was
settled
then
well
he
would
be
reasonable
he
wouldn
t
stand
in
her
way
he
would
let
her
go
for
two
years
he
had
been
living
some
other
luckier
man
s
life
the
time
had
come
when
he
must
drop
back
into
his
own
he
no
longer
tried
to
look
ahead
to
grope
his
way
through
the
endless
labyrinth
of
his
material
difficulties
a
sense
of
dull
resignation
closed
in
on
him
like
a
fog
hullo
glennard
a
voice
said
as
an
late
that
afternoon
dropped
him
at
an
uptown
corner
he
looked
up
and
met
the
interrogative
smile
of
barton
flamel
who
stood
on
the
curbstone
watching
the
retreating
car
with
the
eye
of
a
man
philosophic
enough
to
remember
that
it
will
be
followed
by
another
glennard
felt
his
usual
impulse
of
pleasure
at
meeting
flamel
but
it
was
not
in
this
case
curtailed
by
the
reaction
of
contempt
that
habitually
succeeded
it
probably
even
the
few
men
who
had
known
flamel
since
his
youth
could
have
given
no
good
reason
for
the
vague
mistrust
that
he
inspired
some
people
are
judged
by
their
actions
others
by
their
ideas
and
perhaps
the
shortest
way
of
defining
flamel
is
to
say
that
his
leniency
of
view
was
vaguely
divined
to
include
himself
simple
minds
may
have
resented
the
discovery
that
his
opinions
were
based
on
his
perceptions
but
there
was
certainly
no
more
definite
charge
against
him
than
that
implied
in
the
doubt
as
to
how
he
would
behave
in
an
emergency
and
his
company
was
looked
upon
as
one
of
those
mildly
unwholesome
dissipations
to
which
the
prudent
may
occasionally
yield
it
now
offered
itself
to
glennard
as
an
easy
escape
from
the
obsession
of
moral
problems
which
somehow
could
no
more
be
worn
in
flamel
s
presence
than
a
surplice
in
the
street
where
are
you
going
to
the
club
flamel
asked
adding
as
the
younger
man
assented
why
not
come
to
my
studio
instead
you
ll
see
one
bore
instead
of
the
apartment
which
flamel
described
as
his
studio
showed
as
its
one
claim
to
the
designation
a
perennially
empty
easel
the
rest
of
its
space
being
filled
with
the
evidences
of
a
comprehensive
dilettanteism
against
this
background
which
seemed
the
visible
expression
of
its
owner
s
intellectual
tolerance
rows
of
fine
books
detached
themselves
with
a
prominence
showing
them
to
be
flamel
s
chief
care
glennard
glanced
with
the
eye
of
untrained
curiosity
at
the
lines
of
morocco
while
his
host
busied
himself
with
the
uncorking
of
apollinaris
you
ve
got
a
splendid
lot
of
books
he
said
they
re
fairly
decent
the
other
assented
in
the
curt
tone
of
the
collector
who
will
not
talk
of
his
passion
for
fear
of
talking
of
nothing
else
then
as
glennard
his
hands
in
his
pockets
began
to
stroll
perfunctorily
down
the
long
line
of
bookcases
some
men
flamel
irresistibly
added
think
of
books
merely
as
tools
others
as
tooling
i
m
between
the
two
there
are
days
when
i
use
them
as
scenery
other
days
when
i
want
them
as
society
so
that
as
you
see
my
library
represents
a
makeshift
compromise
between
looks
and
brains
and
the
collectors
look
down
on
me
almost
as
much
as
the
glennard
without
answering
was
mechanically
taking
one
book
after
another
from
the
shelves
his
hands
slipped
curiously
over
the
smooth
covers
and
the
noiseless
subsidence
of
opening
pages
suddenly
he
came
on
a
thin
volume
of
faded
manuscript
what
s
this
he
asked
with
a
listless
sense
of
wonder
ah
you
re
at
my
manuscript
shelf
i
ve
been
going
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
flamel
came
up
and
looked
over
his
shoulders
that
s
a
bit
of
stendhal
one
of
the
italian
stories
and
here
are
some
letters
of
balzac
to
madame
glennard
took
the
book
with
sudden
eagerness
who
was
madame
commanville
his
he
was
conscious
that
flamel
was
looking
at
him
with
the
smile
that
was
like
an
interrogation
point
i
didn
t
know
you
cared
for
this
kind
of
i
don
t
at
least
i
ve
never
had
the
chance
have
you
many
collections
of
letters
lord
no
very
few
i
m
just
beginning
and
most
of
the
interesting
ones
are
out
of
my
reach
here
s
a
queer
little
collection
though
the
rarest
thing
i
ve
got
half
a
dozen
of
shelley
s
letters
to
harriet
westbrook
i
had
a
devil
of
a
time
getting
them
a
lot
of
collectors
were
after
glennard
taking
the
volume
from
his
hand
glanced
with
a
kind
of
repugnance
at
the
interleaving
of
yellow
sheets
she
was
the
one
who
drowned
herself
wasn
t
she
flamel
nodded
i
suppose
that
little
episode
adds
about
fifty
per
cent
to
their
value
he
said
meditatively
glennard
laid
the
book
down
he
wondered
why
he
had
joined
flamel
he
was
in
no
humor
to
be
amused
by
the
older
man
s
talk
and
a
recrudescence
of
personal
misery
rose
about
him
like
an
icy
tide
i
believe
i
must
take
myself
off
he
said
i
d
forgotten
an
he
turned
to
go
but
almost
at
the
same
moment
he
was
conscious
of
a
duality
of
intention
wherein
his
apparent
wish
to
leave
revealed
itself
as
a
last
effort
of
the
will
against
the
overmastering
desire
to
stay
and
unbosom
himself
to
flamel
the
older
man
as
though
divining
the
conflict
laid
a
detaining
pressure
on
his
arm
won
t
the
engagement
keep
sit
down
and
try
one
of
these
cigars
i
don
t
often
have
the
luck
of
seeing
you
i
m
rather
driven
just
now
said
glennard
vaguely
he
found
himself
seated
again
and
flamel
had
pushed
to
his
side
a
low
stand
holding
a
bottle
of
apollinaris
and
a
decanter
of
cognac
flamel
thrown
back
in
his
capacious
surveyed
him
through
a
cloud
of
smoke
with
the
comfortable
tolerance
of
the
man
to
whom
no
inconsistencies
need
be
explained
connivance
was
implicit
in
the
air
it
was
the
kind
of
atmosphere
in
which
the
outrageous
loses
its
edge
glennard
felt
a
gradual
relaxing
of
his
nerves
i
suppose
one
has
to
pay
a
lot
for
letters
like
that
he
heard
himself
asking
with
a
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
volume
he
had
laid
aside
oh
depends
on
flamel
viewed
him
thoughtfully
are
you
thinking
of
collecting
glennard
laughed
lord
no
the
other
way
selling
oh
i
hardly
know
i
was
thinking
of
a
poor
chap
flamel
filled
the
pause
with
a
nod
of
interest
a
poor
chap
i
used
to
know
who
died
he
died
last
year
and
who
left
me
a
lot
of
letters
letters
he
thought
a
great
deal
of
he
was
fond
of
me
and
left
em
to
me
outright
with
the
idea
i
suppose
that
they
might
benefit
me
somehow
i
don
t
know
i
m
not
much
up
on
such
things
he
reached
his
hand
to
the
tall
glass
his
host
had
filled
a
collection
of
autograph
letters
eh
any
big
names
oh
only
one
name
they
re
all
letters
written
to
him
by
one
person
you
understand
a
woman
in
fact
oh
a
woman
said
flamel
negligently
glennard
was
nettled
by
his
obvious
loss
of
interest
i
rather
think
they
d
attract
a
good
deal
of
notice
if
they
were
flamel
still
looked
uninterested
i
suppose
oh
just
the
letters
a
woman
would
write
to
a
man
she
knew
well
they
were
tremendous
friends
he
and
and
she
wrote
a
clever
letter
clever
it
was
margaret
a
great
silence
filled
the
room
it
seemed
to
glennard
that
the
words
had
burst
from
him
as
blood
gushes
from
a
wound
great
scott
said
flamel
sitting
up
a
collection
of
margaret
aubyn
s
letters
did
you
say
you
had
them
they
were
left
me
by
my
i
see
was
he
well
no
matter
you
re
to
be
congratulated
at
any
rate
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
glennard
stood
up
with
a
sense
of
weariness
in
all
his
bones
oh
i
don
t
know
i
haven
t
thought
much
about
it
i
just
happened
to
see
that
some
fellow
was
writing
her
life
joslin
yes
you
didn
t
think
of
giving
them
to
him
glennard
had
lounged
across
the
room
and
stood
staring
up
at
a
bronze
bacchus
who
drooped
his
garlanded
head
above
the
pediment
of
an
italian
cabinet
what
ought
i
to
do
you
re
just
the
fellow
to
advise
he
felt
the
blood
in
his
cheek
as
he
spoke
flamel
sat
with
meditative
eye
what
do
you
want
to
do
with
them
he
asked
i
want
to
publish
them
said
glennard
swinging
round
with
sudden
energy
if
i
can
if
you
can
they
re
yours
you
say
they
re
mine
fast
enough
there
s
no
one
to
prevent
i
mean
there
are
no
restrictions
he
was
arrested
by
the
sense
that
these
accumulated
proofs
of
impunity
might
precisely
stand
as
the
strongest
check
on
his
action
and
aubyn
had
no
family
i
believe
then
i
don
t
see
who
s
to
interfere
said
flamel
studying
his
glennard
had
turned
his
unseeing
stare
on
an
ecstatic
saint
catherine
framed
in
tarnished
gilding
it
s
just
this
way
he
began
again
with
an
effort
when
letters
are
as
personal
as
as
these
of
my
friend
s
well
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
that
the
cash
would
make
a
heap
of
difference
to
me
such
a
lot
that
it
rather
obscures
my
judgment
the
fact
is
if
i
could
lay
my
hand
on
a
few
thousands
now
i
could
get
into
a
big
thing
and
without
appreciable
risk
and
i
d
like
to
know
whether
you
think
i
d
be
justified
under
the
circumstances
he
paused
with
a
dry
throat
it
seemed
to
him
at
the
moment
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
ever
to
sink
lower
in
his
own
estimation
he
was
in
truth
less
ashamed
of
weighing
the
temptation
than
of
submitting
his
scruples
to
a
man
like
flamel
and
affecting
to
appeal
to
sentiments
of
delicacy
on
the
absence
of
which
he
had
consciously
reckoned
but
he
had
reached
a
point
where
each
word
seemed
to
compel
another
as
each
wave
in
a
stream
is
forced
forward
by
the
pressure
behind
it
and
before
flamel
could
speak
he
had
faltered
out
you
don
t
think
people
could
say
could
criticise
the
man
but
the
man
s
dead
isn
t
he
he
s
dead
yes
but
can
i
assume
the
responsibility
without
flamel
hesitated
and
almost
immediately
glennard
s
scruples
gave
way
to
irritation
if
at
this
hour
flamel
were
to
affect
an
inopportune
reluctance
the
older
man
s
answer
reassured
him
why
need
you
assume
any
responsibility
your
name
won
t
appear
of
course
and
as
to
your
friend
s
i
don
t
see
why
his
should
either
he
wasn
t
a
celebrity
himself
i
suppose
no
then
the
letters
can
be
addressed
to
blank
doesn
t
that
make
it
all
right
glennard
s
hesitation
revived
for
the
public
yes
but
i
don
t
see
that
it
alters
the
case
for
me
the
question
is
ought
i
to
publish
them
at
all
of
course
you
ought
flamel
spoke
with
invigorating
emphasis
i
doubt
if
you
d
be
justified
in
keeping
them
back
anything
of
margaret
aubyn
s
is
more
or
less
public
property
by
this
time
she
s
too
great
for
any
one
of
us
i
was
only
wondering
how
you
could
use
them
to
the
best
advantage
to
yourself
i
mean
how
many
are
there
oh
a
lot
perhaps
a
hundred
i
haven
t
counted
there
may
be
more
gad
what
a
haul
when
were
they
written
i
don
t
know
that
is
they
corresponded
for
years
what
s
the
odds
he
moved
toward
his
hat
with
a
vague
impulse
of
flight
it
all
counts
said
flamel
imperturbably
a
long
correspondence
one
i
mean
that
covers
a
great
deal
of
time
is
obviously
worth
more
than
if
the
same
number
of
letters
had
been
written
within
a
year
at
any
rate
you
won
t
give
them
to
joslin
they
d
fill
a
book
wouldn
t
they
i
suppose
so
i
don
t
know
how
much
it
takes
to
fill
a
not
you
say
why
flashed
from
glennard
oh
nothing
only
the
big
public
is
sentimental
and
if
they
were
why
you
could
get
any
money
for
margaret
aubyn
s
glennard
was
silent
are
the
letters
interesting
in
themselves
i
mean
apart
from
the
association
with
her
name
i
m
no
glennard
took
up
his
hat
and
thrust
himself
into
his
overcoat
i
dare
say
i
sha
n
t
do
anything
about
it
and
flamel
you
won
t
mention
this
to
anyone
lord
no
well
i
congratulate
you
you
ve
got
a
big
flamel
was
smiling
at
him
from
the
hearth
glennard
on
the
threshold
forced
a
response
to
the
smile
while
he
questioned
with
loitering
indifference
financially
eh
rather
i
should
say
glennard
s
hand
lingered
on
the
knob
how
much
should
you
say
you
know
about
such
oh
i
should
have
to
see
the
letters
but
i
should
say
well
if
you
ve
got
enough
to
fill
a
book
and
they
re
fairly
readable
and
the
book
is
brought
out
at
the
right
time
say
ten
thousand
down
from
the
publisher
and
possibly
one
or
two
more
in
royalties
if
you
got
the
publishers
bidding
against
each
other
you
might
do
even
better
but
of
course
i
m
talking
in
the
of
course
said
glennard
with
sudden
dizziness
his
hand
had
slipped
from
the
knob
and
he
stood
staring
down
at
the
exotic
spirals
of
the
persian
rug
beneath
his
feet
i
d
have
to
see
the
letters
flamel
repeated
of
course
you
d
have
to
see
them
glennard
stammered
and
without
turning
he
flung
over
his
shoulder
an
inarticulate
v
the
little
house
as
glennard
strolled
up
to
it
between
the
trees
seemed
no
more
than
a
gay
tent
pitched
against
the
sunshine
it
had
the
crispness
of
a
freshly
starched
summer
gown
and
the
geraniums
on
the
veranda
bloomed
as
simultaneously
as
the
flowers
in
a
bonnet
the
garden
was
prospering
absurdly
seed
they
had
sown
at
random
amid
laughing
of
incompetence
had
shot
up
in
fragrant
defiance
of
their
blunders
he
smiled
to
see
the
clematis
unfolding
its
punctual
wings
about
the
porch
the
tiny
lawn
was
smooth
as
a
shaven
cheek
and
a
crimson
rambler
mounted
to
the
of
a
baby
who
never
cried
a
breeze
shook
the
awning
above
the
and
his
wife
as
he
drew
near
could
be
seen
bending
above
a
kettle
that
was
just
about
to
boil
so
vividly
did
the
whole
scene
suggest
the
painted
bliss
of
a
stage
setting
that
it
would
have
been
hardly
surprising
to
see
her
step
forward
among
the
flowers
and
trill
out
her
virtuous
happiness
from
the
the
stale
heat
of
the
long
day
in
town
the
dusty
promiscuity
of
the
suburban
train
were
now
but
the
requisite
foil
to
an
evening
of
scented
breezes
and
tranquil
talk
they
had
been
married
more
than
a
year
and
each
still
reflected
the
freshness
of
their
first
day
together
if
indeed
their
happiness
had
a
flaw
it
was
in
resembling
too
closely
the
bright
impermanence
of
their
surroundings
their
love
as
yet
was
but
the
gay
tent
of
his
wife
looked
up
with
a
smile
the
country
life
suited
her
and
her
beauty
had
gained
depth
from
a
stillness
in
which
certain
faces
might
have
grown
opaque
are
you
very
tired
she
asked
pouring
his
tea
just
enough
to
enjoy
he
rose
from
the
chair
in
which
he
had
thrown
himself
and
bent
over
the
tray
for
his
cream
you
ve
had
a
visitor
he
commented
noticing
a
cup
beside
her
own
only
flamel
she
said
indifferently
flamel
again
she
answered
without
show
of
surprise
he
left
just
now
his
yacht
is
down
at
laurel
bay
and
he
borrowed
a
trap
of
the
dreshams
to
drive
over
glennard
made
no
comment
and
she
went
on
leaning
her
head
back
against
the
cushions
of
her
he
wants
us
to
go
for
a
sail
with
him
next
glennard
meditatively
stirred
his
tea
he
was
trying
to
think
of
the
most
natural
and
unartificial
thing
to
say
and
his
voice
seemed
to
come
from
the
outside
as
though
he
were
speaking
behind
a
marionette
do
you
want
to
just
as
you
please
she
said
compliantly
no
affectation
of
indifference
could
have
been
as
baffling
as
her
compliance
glennard
of
late
was
beginning
to
feel
that
the
surface
which
a
year
ago
he
had
taken
for
a
sheet
of
clear
glass
might
after
all
be
a
mirror
reflecting
merely
his
own
conception
of
what
lay
behind
it
do
you
like
flamel
he
suddenly
asked
to
which
still
engaged
with
her
tea
she
returned
the
feminine
answer
i
thought
you
i
do
of
course
he
agreed
vexed
at
his
own
incorrigible
tendency
to
magnify
flamel
s
importance
by
hovering
about
the
topic
a
sail
would
be
rather
jolly
let
s
she
made
no
reply
and
he
drew
forth
the
evening
papers
which
he
had
thrust
into
his
pocket
on
leaving
the
train
as
he
smoothed
them
out
his
own
countenance
seemed
to
undergo
the
same
process
he
ran
his
eye
down
the
list
of
stocks
and
flamel
s
importunate
personality
receded
behind
the
rows
of
figures
pushing
forward
into
notice
like
so
many
bearers
of
good
news
glennard
s
investments
were
flowering
like
his
garden
the
dryest
shares
blossomed
into
dividends
and
a
golden
harvest
awaited
his
sickle
he
glanced
at
his
wife
with
the
tranquil
air
of
the
man
who
digests
good
luck
as
naturally
as
the
dry
ground
absorbs
a
shower
things
are
looking
uncommonly
well
i
believe
we
shall
be
able
to
go
to
town
for
two
or
three
months
next
winter
if
we
can
find
something
she
smiled
luxuriously
it
was
pleasant
to
be
able
to
say
with
an
air
of
balancing
relative
advantages
really
on
the
baby
s
account
i
shall
be
almost
sorry
but
if
we
do
go
there
s
kate
erskine
s
house
she
ll
let
us
have
it
for
almost
nothing
well
write
her
about
it
he
recommended
his
eyes
travelling
on
in
search
of
the
weather
report
he
had
turned
to
the
wrong
page
and
suddenly
a
line
of
black
characters
leapt
out
at
him
as
from
an
ambush
margaret
aubyn
s
two
volumes
out
first
edition
of
five
thousand
sold
out
before
leaving
the
press
second
edition
ready
next
week
the
book
of
the
year
he
looked
up
stupidly
his
wife
still
sat
with
her
head
thrown
back
her
pure
profile
detached
against
the
cushions
she
was
smiling
a
little
over
the
prospect
his
last
words
had
opened
behind
her
head
shivers
of
sun
and
shade
ran
across
the
striped
awning
a
row
of
maples
and
a
privet
hedge
hid
their
neighbor
s
gables
giving
them
undivided
possession
of
their
leafy
and
life
a
moment
before
had
been
like
their
plot
of
ground
shut
off
hedged
in
from
importunities
impenetrably
his
and
hers
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
every
every
was
a
relentless
human
gaze
pressing
close
upon
their
privacy
it
was
as
though
they
sat
in
a
brightly
lit
room
uncurtained
from
a
darkness
full
of
hostile
watchers
his
wife
still
smiled
and
her
unconsciousness
of
danger
seemed
in
some
horrible
way
to
put
her
beyond
the
reach
of
rescue
he
had
not
known
that
it
would
be
like
this
after
the
first
odious
weeks
spent
in
preparing
the
letters
for
publication
in
submitting
them
to
flamel
and
in
negotiating
with
the
publishers
the
transaction
had
dropped
out
of
his
consciousness
into
that
unvisited
limbo
to
which
we
relegate
the
deeds
we
would
rather
not
have
done
but
have
no
notion
of
undoing
from
the
moment
he
had
obtained
miss
trent
s
promise
not
to
sail
with
her
aunt
he
had
tried
to
imagine
himself
irrevocably
committed
after
that
he
argued
his
first
duty
was
to
her
she
had
become
his
conscience
the
sum
obtained
from
the
publishers
by
flamel
s
adroit
manipulations
and
opportunely
transferred
to
dinslow
s
successful
venture
already
yielded
a
return
which
combined
with
glennard
s
professional
earnings
took
the
edge
of
compulsion
from
their
way
of
living
making
it
appear
the
expression
of
a
graceful
preference
for
simplicity
it
was
the
mitigated
poverty
which
can
subscribe
to
a
review
or
two
and
have
a
few
flowers
on
the
and
already
in
a
small
way
glennard
was
beginning
to
feel
the
magnetic
quality
of
prosperity
clients
who
had
passed
his
door
in
the
hungry
days
sought
it
out
now
that
it
bore
the
name
of
a
successful
man
it
was
understood
that
a
small
inheritance
cleverly
invested
was
the
source
of
his
fortune
and
there
was
a
feeling
that
a
man
who
could
do
so
well
for
himself
was
likely
to
know
how
to
turn
over
other
people
s
money
but
it
was
in
the
more
intimate
reward
of
his
wife
s
happiness
that
glennard
tasted
the
full
flavor
of
success
coming
out
of
conditions
so
narrow
that
those
he
offered
her
seemed
spacious
she
fitted
into
her
new
life
without
any
of
those
manifest
efforts
at
adjustment
that
are
as
sore
to
a
husband
s
pride
as
the
critical
rearrangement
of
the
bridal
furniture
she
had
given
him
instead
the
delicate
pleasure
of
watching
her
expand
like
a
restored
to
its
element
stretching
out
the
atrophied
tentacles
of
girlish
vanity
and
enjoyment
to
the
rising
tide
of
opportunity
and
somehow
in
the
windowless
inner
cell
of
his
consciousness
where
cowered
glennard
s
course
seemed
justified
by
its
merely
material
success
how
could
such
a
crop
of
innocent
blessedness
have
sprung
from
tainted
soil
now
he
had
the
injured
sense
of
a
man
entrapped
into
a
disadvantageous
bargain
he
had
not
known
it
would
be
like
this
and
a
dull
anger
gathered
at
his
heart
anger
against
whom
against
his
wife
for
not
knowing
what
he
suffered
against
flamel
for
being
the
unconscious
instrument
of
his
or
against
that
mute
memory
to
which
his
own
act
had
suddenly
given
a
voice
of
accusation
yes
that
was
it
and
his
punishment
henceforth
would
be
the
presence
the
unescapable
presence
of
the
woman
he
had
so
persistently
evaded
she
would
always
be
there
now
it
was
as
though
he
had
married
her
instead
of
the
other
it
was
what
she
had
always
wanted
to
be
with
him
and
she
had
gained
her
point
at
last
he
sprang
up
as
though
in
an
impulse
of
flight
the
sudden
movement
lifted
his
wife
s
lids
and
she
asked
in
the
incurious
voice
of
the
woman
whose
life
is
enclosed
in
a
magic
circle
of
prosperity
any
news
no
none
he
said
roused
to
a
sense
of
immediate
peril
the
papers
lay
scattered
at
his
feet
what
if
she
were
to
see
them
he
stretched
his
arm
to
gather
them
up
but
his
next
thought
showed
him
the
futility
of
such
concealment
the
same
advertisement
would
appear
every
day
for
weeks
to
come
in
every
newspaper
how
could
he
prevent
her
seeing
it
he
could
not
always
be
hiding
the
papers
from
her
well
and
what
if
she
did
see
it
it
would
signify
nothing
to
her
the
chances
were
that
she
would
never
even
read
the
book
as
she
ceased
to
be
an
element
of
fear
in
his
calculations
the
distance
between
them
seemed
to
lessen
and
he
took
her
again
as
it
were
into
the
circle
of
his
conjugal
protection
yet
a
moment
before
he
had
almost
hated
her
he
laughed
aloud
at
his
senseless
terrors
he
was
off
his
balance
decidedly
what
are
you
laughing
at
she
asked
he
explained
elaborately
that
he
was
laughing
at
the
recollection
of
an
old
woman
in
the
train
an
old
woman
with
a
lot
of
bundles
who
couldn
t
find
her
ticket
but
somehow
in
the
telling
the
humor
of
the
story
seemed
to
evaporate
and
he
felt
the
conventionality
of
her
smile
he
glanced
at
his
watch
isn
t
it
time
to
dress
she
rose
with
serene
reluctance
it
s
a
pity
to
go
in
the
garden
looks
so
they
lingered
side
by
side
surveying
their
domain
there
was
not
space
in
it
at
this
hour
for
the
shadow
of
the
in
the
angle
of
the
hedge
it
crossed
the
lawn
cut
the
in
two
and
ran
up
the
side
of
the
house
to
the
nursery
window
she
bent
to
flick
a
caterpillar
from
the
then
as
they
turned
indoors
if
we
mean
to
go
on
the
yacht
next
sunday
she
suggested
oughtn
t
you
to
let
flamel
know
glennard
s
exasperation
deflected
suddenly
of
course
i
shall
let
him
know
you
always
seem
to
imply
that
i
m
going
to
do
something
rude
to
the
words
reverberated
through
her
silence
she
had
a
way
of
thus
leaving
one
space
in
which
to
contemplate
one
s
folly
at
arm
s
length
glennard
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
upstairs
as
he
dropped
into
a
chair
before
his
he
said
to
himself
that
in
the
last
hour
he
had
sounded
the
depths
of
his
humiliation
and
that
the
lowest
dregs
of
it
the
very
was
the
hateful
necessity
of
having
always
as
long
as
the
two
men
lived
to
be
civil
to
barton
flamel
vi
the
week
in
town
had
been
sultry
and
the
men
in
the
sunday
emancipation
of
white
flannel
and
duck
filled
the
of
the
yacht
with
their
outstretched
apathy
following
through
a
mist
of
the
flitting
inconsequences
of
the
women
the
party
was
a
small
one
flamel
had
few
intimate
friends
but
composed
of
more
heterogeneous
atoms
than
the
little
pools
into
which
society
usually
runs
the
reaction
from
the
chief
episode
of
his
earlier
life
had
bred
in
glennard
an
uneasy
distaste
for
any
kind
of
personal
saliency
cleverness
was
useful
in
business
but
in
society
it
seemed
to
him
as
futile
as
the
sham
cascades
formed
by
a
stream
that
might
have
been
used
to
drive
a
mill
he
liked
the
collective
point
of
view
that
goes
with
the
civilized
uniformity
of
and
his
wife
s
attitude
implied
the
same
preference
yet
they
found
themselves
slipping
more
and
more
into
flamel
s
intimacy
alexa
had
once
or
twice
said
that
she
enjoyed
meeting
clever
people
but
her
enjoyment
took
the
negative
form
of
a
smiling
receptivity
and
glennard
felt
a
growing
preference
for
the
kind
of
people
who
have
their
thinking
done
for
them
by
the
community
still
the
deck
of
the
yacht
was
a
pleasant
refuge
from
the
heat
on
shore
and
his
wife
s
profile
serenely
projected
against
the
changing
blue
lay
on
his
retina
like
a
cool
hand
on
the
nerves
he
had
never
been
more
impressed
by
the
kind
of
absoluteness
that
lifted
her
beauty
above
the
transient
effects
of
other
women
making
the
most
harmonious
face
seem
an
accidental
collocation
of
features
the
ladies
who
directly
suggested
this
comparison
were
of
a
kind
accustomed
to
take
similar
risks
with
more
gratifying
results
armiger
had
in
fact
long
been
the
triumphant
alternative
of
those
who
couldn
t
see
alexa
glennard
s
looks
and
touchett
s
claims
to
consideration
were
founded
on
that
distribution
of
effects
which
is
the
wonder
of
those
who
admire
a
highly
cultivated
country
the
third
lady
of
the
trio
which
glennard
s
fancy
had
put
to
such
unflattering
uses
was
bound
by
circumstances
to
support
the
claims
of
the
other
two
this
was
dresham
the
wife
of
the
editor
of
the
radiator
dresham
was
a
lady
who
had
rescued
herself
from
social
obscurity
by
assuming
the
role
of
her
husband
s
exponent
and
interpreter
and
dresham
s
leisure
being
devoted
to
the
cultivation
of
remarkable
women
his
wife
s
attitude
committed
her
to
the
public
celebration
of
their
remarkableness
for
the
conceivable
tedium
of
this
duty
dresham
was
repaid
by
the
fact
that
there
were
people
who
took
her
for
a
remarkable
woman
and
who
in
turn
probably
purchased
similar
distinction
with
the
small
change
of
her
reflected
importance
as
to
the
other
ladies
of
the
party
they
were
simply
the
wives
of
some
of
the
men
the
kind
of
women
who
expect
to
be
talked
to
collectively
and
to
have
their
questions
left
unanswered
armiger
the
latest
embodiment
of
dresham
s
instinct
for
the
remarkable
was
an
innocent
beauty
who
for
years
had
distilled
dulness
among
a
set
of
people
now
by
their
inability
to
appreciate
her
under
dresham
s
tutelage
she
had
developed
into
a
thoughtful
woman
who
read
his
leaders
in
the
radiator
and
bought
the
books
he
recommended
when
a
new
novel
appeared
people
wanted
to
know
what
armiger
thought
of
it
and
a
young
gentleman
who
had
made
a
trip
in
touraine
had
recently
inscribed
to
her
the
result
of
his
explorations
glennard
leaning
back
with
his
head
against
the
rail
and
a
slit
of
fugitive
blue
between
his
lids
vaguely
wished
she
wouldn
t
spoil
the
afternoon
by
making
people
talk
though
he
reduced
his
annoyance
to
the
minimum
by
not
listening
to
what
was
said
there
remained
a
latent
irritation
against
the
general
futility
of
words
his
wife
s
gift
of
silence
seemed
to
him
the
most
vivid
commentary
on
the
clumsiness
of
speech
as
a
means
of
intercourse
and
his
eyes
had
turned
to
her
in
renewed
appreciation
of
this
finer
faculty
when
armiger
s
voice
abruptly
brought
home
to
him
the
underrated
potentialities
of
language
you
ve
read
them
of
course
glennard
he
heard
her
ask
and
in
reply
to
alexa
s
vague
interrogation
why
the
aubyn
letters
it
s
the
only
book
people
are
talking
of
this
dresham
immediately
saw
her
advantage
you
haven
t
read
them
how
very
extraordinary
as
armiger
says
the
book
s
in
the
air
one
breathes
it
in
like
the
glennard
sat
motionless
watching
his
wife
perhaps
it
hasn
t
reached
the
suburbs
yet
she
said
with
her
unruffled
smile
oh
do
let
me
come
to
you
then
touchett
cried
anything
for
a
change
of
air
i
m
positively
sick
of
the
book
and
i
can
t
put
it
down
can
t
you
sail
us
beyond
its
reach
flamel
flamel
shook
his
head
not
even
with
this
breeze
literature
travels
faster
than
steam
nowadays
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
we
can
t
any
of
us
give
up
reading
it
s
as
insidious
as
a
vice
and
as
tiresome
as
a
i
believe
it
is
a
vice
almost
to
read
such
a
book
as
the
letters
said
touchett
it
s
the
woman
s
soul
absolutely
torn
up
by
the
roots
her
whole
self
laid
bare
and
to
a
man
who
evidently
didn
t
care
who
couldn
t
have
cared
i
don
t
mean
to
read
another
line
it
s
too
much
like
listening
at
a
but
if
she
wanted
it
published
wanted
it
how
do
we
know
she
did
why
i
heard
she
d
left
the
letters
to
the
man
whoever
he
is
with
directions
that
they
should
be
published
after
his
death
i
don
t
believe
it
touchett
declared
he
s
dead
then
is
he
one
of
the
men
asked
why
you
don
t
suppose
if
he
were
alive
he
could
ever
hold
up
his
head
again
with
these
letters
being
read
by
everybody
touchett
protested
it
must
have
been
horrible
enough
to
know
they
d
been
written
to
him
but
to
publish
them
no
man
could
have
done
it
and
no
woman
could
have
told
him
to
oh
come
come
dresham
judicially
interposed
after
all
they
re
not
no
that
s
the
worst
of
it
they
re
unloved
letters
touchett
retorted
then
obviously
she
needn
t
have
written
them
whereas
the
man
poor
devil
could
hardly
help
receiving
perhaps
he
counted
on
the
public
to
save
him
the
trouble
of
reading
them
said
young
hartly
who
was
in
the
cynical
stage
armiger
turned
her
reproachful
loveliness
to
dresham
from
the
way
you
defend
him
i
believe
you
know
who
he
everyone
looked
at
dresham
and
his
wife
smiled
with
the
superior
air
of
the
woman
who
is
in
her
husband
s
professional
secrets
dresham
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
have
i
said
to
defend
him
you
called
him
a
poor
devil
you
pitied
a
man
who
could
let
margaret
aubyn
write
to
him
in
that
way
of
course
i
pity
then
you
must
know
who
he
is
cried
armiger
with
a
triumphant
air
of
penetration
hartly
and
flamel
laughed
and
dresham
shook
his
head
no
one
knows
not
even
the
publishers
so
they
tell
me
at
so
they
tell
you
to
tell
us
hartly
astutely
amended
and
armiger
added
with
the
appearance
of
carrying
the
argument
a
point
farther
but
even
if
he
s
dead
and
she
s
dead
somebody
must
have
given
the
letters
to
the
a
little
bird
probably
said
dresham
smiling
indulgently
on
her
deduction
a
little
bird
of
prey
then
a
vulture
i
should
say
another
man
interpolated
oh
i
m
not
with
you
there
said
dresham
easily
those
letters
belonged
to
the
how
can
any
letters
belong
to
the
public
that
weren
t
written
to
the
public
touchett
interposed
well
these
were
in
a
sense
a
personality
as
big
as
margaret
aubyn
s
belongs
to
the
world
such
a
mind
is
part
of
the
general
fund
of
thought
it
s
the
penalty
of
greatness
one
becomes
a
monument
historique
posterity
pays
the
cost
of
keeping
one
up
but
on
condition
that
one
is
always
open
to
the
i
don
t
see
that
that
exonerates
the
man
who
gives
up
the
keys
of
the
sanctuary
as
it
who
was
he
another
voice
inquired
who
was
he
oh
nobody
i
fancy
the
the
slit
in
the
wall
through
which
the
letters
passed
to
posterity
but
she
never
meant
them
for
posterity
a
woman
shouldn
t
write
such
letters
if
she
doesn
t
mean
them
to
be
published
she
shouldn
t
write
them
to
such
a
man
touchett
scornfully
corrected
i
never
keep
letters
said
armiger
under
the
obvious
impression
that
she
was
contributing
a
valuable
point
to
the
discussion
there
was
a
general
laugh
and
flamel
who
had
not
spoken
said
lazily
you
women
are
too
incurably
subjective
i
venture
to
say
that
most
men
would
see
in
those
letters
merely
their
immense
literary
value
their
significance
as
documents
the
personal
side
doesn
t
count
where
there
s
so
much
oh
we
all
know
you
haven
t
any
principles
armiger
declared
and
alexa
glennard
lifting
an
indolent
smile
said
i
shall
never
write
you
a
glennard
moved
away
impatiently
such
talk
was
as
tedious
as
the
buzzing
of
gnats
he
wondered
why
his
wife
had
wanted
to
drag
him
on
such
a
senseless
expedition
he
hated
flamel
s
crowd
and
what
business
had
flamel
himself
to
interfere
in
that
way
standing
up
for
the
publication
of
the
letters
as
though
glennard
needed
his
defence
glennard
turned
his
head
and
saw
that
flamel
had
drawn
a
seat
to
alexa
s
elbow
and
was
speaking
to
her
in
a
low
tone
the
other
groups
had
scattered
straying
in
twos
along
the
deck
it
came
over
glennard
that
he
should
never
again
be
able
to
see
flamel
speaking
to
his
wife
without
the
sense
of
sick
mistrust
that
now
loosened
his
joints
alexa
the
next
morning
over
their
early
breakfast
surprised
her
husband
by
an
unexpected
request
will
you
bring
me
those
letters
from
town
she
asked
what
letters
he
said
putting
down
his
cup
he
felt
himself
as
helplessly
vulnerable
as
a
man
who
is
lunged
at
in
the
dark
mrs
aubyn
s
the
book
they
were
all
talking
about
glennard
carefully
measuring
his
second
cup
of
tea
said
with
deliberation
i
didn
t
know
you
cared
about
that
sort
of
she
was
in
fact
not
a
great
reader
and
a
new
book
seldom
reached
her
till
it
was
so
to
speak
on
the
home
stretch
but
she
replied
with
a
gentle
tenacity
i
think
it
would
interest
me
because
i
read
her
life
last
her
life
where
did
you
get
that
someone
lent
it
to
me
when
it
came
out
flamel
i
his
first
impulse
was
to
exclaim
why
the
devil
do
you
borrow
books
of
flamel
i
can
buy
you
all
you
want
but
he
felt
himself
irresistibly
forced
into
an
attitude
of
smiling
compliance
flamel
always
has
the
newest
books
going
hasn
t
he
you
must
be
careful
by
the
way
about
returning
what
he
lends
you
he
s
rather
crotchety
about
his
oh
i
m
always
very
careful
she
said
with
a
touch
of
competence
that
struck
him
and
she
added
as
he
caught
up
his
hat
don
t
forget
the
why
had
she
asked
for
the
book
was
her
sudden
wish
to
see
it
the
result
of
some
hint
of
flamel
s
the
thought
turned
glennard
sick
but
he
preserved
sufficient
lucidity
to
tell
himself
a
moment
later
that
his
last
hope
of
would
be
lost
if
he
yielded
to
the
temptation
of
seeing
a
hidden
purpose
in
everything
she
said
and
did
how
much
flamel
guessed
he
had
no
means
of
divining
nor
could
he
predicate
from
what
he
knew
of
the
man
to
what
use
his
inferences
might
be
put
the
very
qualities
that
had
made
flamel
a
useful
adviser
made
him
the
most
dangerous
of
accomplices
glennard
felt
himself
agrope
among
alien
forces
that
his
own
act
had
set
in
motion
alexa
was
a
woman
of
few
requirements
but
her
wishes
even
in
trifles
had
a
definiteness
that
distinguished
them
from
the
fluid
impulses
of
her
kind
he
knew
that
having
once
asked
for
the
book
she
would
not
forget
it
and
he
put
aside
as
an
ineffectual
expedient
his
momentary
idea
of
applying
for
it
at
the
circulating
library
and
telling
her
that
all
the
copies
were
out
if
the
book
was
to
be
bought
it
had
better
be
bought
at
once
he
left
his
office
earlier
than
usual
and
turned
in
at
the
first
on
his
way
to
the
train
the
was
stacked
with
conspicuously
lettered
volumes
margaret
aubyn
flashed
back
at
him
in
endless
repetition
he
plunged
into
the
shop
and
came
on
a
counter
where
the
name
reiterated
itself
on
row
after
row
of
bindings
it
seemed
to
have
driven
the
rest
of
literature
to
the
back
shelves
he
caught
up
a
copy
tossing
the
money
to
an
astonished
clerk
who
pursued
him
to
the
door
with
the
unheeded
offer
to
wrap
up
the
volumes
in
the
street
he
was
seized
with
a
sudden
apprehension
what
if
he
were
to
meet
flamel
the
thought
was
intolerable
he
called
a
cab
and
drove
straight
to
the
station
where
amid
the
fans
of
a
perspiring
crowd
he
waited
a
long
for
his
train
to
start
he
had
thrust
a
volume
in
either
pocket
and
in
the
train
he
dared
not
draw
them
out
but
the
detested
words
leaped
at
him
from
the
folds
of
the
evening
paper
the
air
seemed
full
of
margaret
aubyn
s
name
the
motion
of
the
train
set
it
dancing
up
and
down
on
the
page
of
a
magazine
that
a
man
in
front
of
him
was
reading
at
the
door
he
was
told
that
glennard
was
still
out
and
he
went
upstairs
to
his
room
and
dragged
the
books
from
his
pocket
they
lay
on
the
table
before
him
like
live
things
that
he
feared
to
touch
at
length
he
opened
the
first
volume
a
familiar
letter
sprang
out
at
him
each
word
quickened
by
its
glaring
garb
of
type
the
little
broken
phrases
fled
across
the
page
like
wounded
animals
in
the
open
it
was
a
horrible
sight
a
battue
of
helpless
things
driven
savagely
out
of
shelter
he
had
not
known
it
would
be
like
this
he
understood
now
that
at
the
moment
of
selling
the
letters
he
had
viewed
the
transaction
solely
as
it
affected
himself
as
an
unfortunate
blemish
on
an
otherwise
presentable
record
he
had
scarcely
considered
the
act
in
relation
to
margaret
aubyn
for
death
if
it
hallows
also
makes
innocuous
glennard
s
god
was
a
god
of
the
living
of
the
immediate
the
actual
the
tangible
all
his
days
he
had
lived
in
the
presence
of
that
god
heedless
of
the
divinities
who
below
the
surface
of
our
deeds
and
passions
silently
forge
the
fatal
weapons
of
the
dead
vii
a
knock
roused
him
and
looking
up
he
saw
his
wife
he
met
her
glance
in
silence
and
she
faltered
out
are
you
ill
the
words
restored
his
ill
of
course
not
they
told
me
you
were
out
and
i
came
the
books
lay
between
them
on
the
table
he
wondered
when
she
would
see
them
she
lingered
tentatively
on
the
threshold
with
the
air
of
leaving
his
explanation
on
his
hands
she
was
not
the
kind
of
woman
who
could
be
counted
on
to
fortify
an
excuse
by
appearing
to
dispute
it
where
have
you
been
glennard
asked
moving
forward
so
that
he
obstructed
her
vision
of
the
books
i
walked
over
to
the
dreshams
for
i
can
t
think
what
you
see
in
those
people
he
said
with
a
shrug
adding
uncontrollably
i
suppose
flamel
was
there
no
he
left
on
the
yacht
this
an
answer
so
obstructing
to
the
natural
escape
of
his
irritation
left
glennard
with
no
momentary
resource
but
that
of
strolling
impatiently
to
the
window
as
her
eyes
followed
him
they
lit
on
the
books
ah
you
ve
brought
them
i
m
so
glad
she
exclaimed
he
answered
over
his
shoulder
for
a
woman
who
never
reads
you
make
the
most
astounding
exceptions
her
smile
was
an
exasperating
concession
to
the
probability
that
it
had
been
hot
in
town
or
that
something
had
bothered
him
do
you
mean
it
s
not
nice
to
want
to
read
the
book
she
asked
it
was
not
nice
to
publish
it
certainly
but
after
all
i
m
not
responsible
for
that
am
i
she
paused
and
as
he
made
no
answer
went
on
still
smiling
i
do
read
sometimes
you
know
and
i
m
very
fond
of
margaret
aubyn
s
books
i
was
reading
pomegranate
seed
when
we
first
met
don
t
you
remember
it
was
then
you
told
me
all
about
glennard
had
turned
back
into
the
room
and
stood
staring
at
his
wife
all
about
her
he
repeated
and
with
the
words
remembrance
came
to
him
he
had
found
miss
trent
one
afternoon
with
the
novel
in
her
hand
and
moved
by
the
lover
s
fatuous
impulse
to
associate
himself
in
some
way
with
whatever
fills
the
mind
of
the
beloved
had
broken
through
his
habitual
silence
about
the
past
rewarded
by
the
consciousness
of
figuring
impressively
in
miss
trent
s
imagination
he
had
gone
on
from
one
anecdote
to
another
reviving
dormant
details
of
his
old
hillbridge
life
and
pasturing
his
vanity
on
the
eagerness
with
which
she
received
his
reminiscences
of
a
being
already
clothed
in
the
impersonality
of
greatness
the
incident
had
left
no
trace
in
his
mind
but
it
sprang
up
now
like
an
old
enemy
the
more
dangerous
for
having
been
forgotten
the
instinct
of
sometimes
the
most
perilous
that
man
can
exercise
made
him
awkwardly
declare
oh
i
used
to
see
her
at
people
s
houses
that
was
all
and
her
silence
as
usual
leaving
room
for
a
multiplication
of
blunders
he
added
with
increased
indifference
i
simply
can
t
see
what
you
can
find
to
interest
you
in
such
a
she
seemed
to
consider
this
intently
you
ve
read
it
then
i
glanced
at
it
i
never
read
such
is
it
true
that
she
didn
t
wish
the
letters
to
be
published
glennard
felt
the
sudden
dizziness
of
the
mountaineer
on
a
narrow
ledge
and
with
it
the
sense
that
he
was
lost
if
he
looked
more
than
a
step
ahead
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
he
said
then
summoning
a
smile
he
passed
his
hand
through
her
arm
i
didn
t
have
tea
at
the
dreshams
you
know
won
t
you
give
me
some
now
he
suggested
that
evening
glennard
under
pretext
of
work
to
be
done
shut
himself
into
the
small
study
opening
off
the
as
he
gathered
up
his
papers
he
said
to
his
wife
you
re
not
going
to
sit
indoors
on
such
a
night
as
this
i
ll
join
you
presently
but
she
had
drawn
her
armchair
to
the
lamp
i
want
to
look
at
my
book
she
said
taking
up
the
first
volume
of
the
glennard
with
a
shrug
withdrew
into
the
study
i
m
going
to
shut
the
door
i
want
to
be
quiet
he
explained
from
the
threshold
and
she
nodded
without
lifting
her
eyes
from
the
book
he
sank
into
a
chair
staring
aimlessly
at
the
outspread
papers
how
was
he
to
work
while
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
she
sat
with
that
volume
in
her
hand
the
door
did
not
shut
her
out
he
saw
her
distinctly
felt
her
close
to
him
in
a
contact
as
painful
as
the
pressure
on
a
bruise
the
sensation
was
part
of
the
general
strangeness
that
made
him
feel
like
a
man
waking
from
a
long
sleep
to
find
himself
in
an
unknown
country
among
people
of
alien
tongue
we
live
in
our
own
souls
as
in
an
unmapped
region
a
few
acres
of
which
we
have
cleared
for
our
habitation
while
of
the
nature
of
those
nearest
us
we
know
but
the
boundaries
that
march
with
ours
of
the
points
in
his
wife
s
character
not
in
direct
contact
with
his
own
glennard
now
discerned
his
ignorance
and
the
baffling
sense
of
her
remoteness
was
intensified
by
the
discovery
that
in
one
way
she
was
closer
to
him
than
ever
before
as
one
may
live
for
years
in
happy
unconsciousness
of
the
possession
of
a
sensitive
nerve
he
had
lived
beside
his
wife
unaware
that
her
individuality
had
become
a
part
of
the
texture
of
his
life
ineradicable
as
some
growth
on
a
vital
organ
and
he
now
felt
himself
at
once
incapable
of
forecasting
her
judgment
and
powerless
to
evade
its
effects
to
escape
the
next
morning
the
confidences
of
the
he
went
to
town
earlier
than
usual
his
wife
who
read
slowly
was
given
to
talking
over
what
she
read
and
at
present
his
first
object
in
life
was
to
postpone
the
inevitable
discussion
of
the
letters
this
instinct
of
protection
in
the
afternoon
on
his
way
uptown
guided
him
to
the
club
in
search
of
a
man
who
might
be
persuaded
to
come
out
to
the
country
to
dine
the
only
man
in
the
club
was
flamel
glennard
as
he
heard
himself
almost
involuntarily
pressing
flamel
to
come
and
dine
felt
the
full
irony
of
the
situation
to
use
flamel
as
a
shield
against
his
wife
s
scrutiny
was
only
a
shade
less
humiliating
than
to
reckon
on
his
wife
as
a
defence
against
flamel
he
felt
a
contradictory
movement
of
annoyance
at
the
latter
s
ready
acceptance
and
the
two
men
drove
in
silence
to
the
station
as
they
passed
the
bookstall
in
the
flamel
lingered
a
moment
and
the
eyes
of
both
fell
on
margaret
aubyn
s
name
conspicuously
displayed
above
a
counter
stacked
with
the
familiar
volumes
we
shall
be
late
you
know
glennard
remonstrated
pulling
out
his
watch
go
ahead
said
flamel
imperturbably
i
want
to
get
something
glennard
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
down
the
platform
flamel
rejoined
him
with
an
magazine
in
his
hand
but
glennard
dared
not
even
glance
at
the
cover
lest
it
should
show
the
syllables
he
feared
the
train
was
full
of
people
they
knew
and
they
were
kept
apart
till
it
dropped
them
at
the
little
suburban
station
as
they
strolled
up
the
shaded
hill
glennard
talked
volubly
pointing
out
the
improvements
in
the
neighborhood
deploring
the
threatened
approach
of
an
electric
railway
and
screening
himself
by
a
series
of
reflex
adjustments
from
the
imminent
risk
of
any
allusion
to
the
flamel
suffered
his
discourse
with
the
bland
inattention
that
we
accord
to
the
affairs
of
someone
else
s
suburb
and
they
reached
the
shelter
of
alexa
s
without
a
perceptible
turn
toward
the
dreaded
topic
the
dinner
passed
off
safely
flamel
always
at
his
best
in
alexa
s
presence
gave
her
the
kind
of
attention
which
is
like
a
beaconing
light
thrown
on
the
speaker
s
words
his
answers
seemed
to
bring
out
a
latent
significance
in
her
phrases
as
the
sculptor
draws
his
statue
from
the
block
glennard
under
his
wife
s
composure
detected
a
sensibility
to
this
manoeuvre
and
the
discovery
was
like
the
across
a
nocturnal
landscape
thus
far
these
momentary
illuminations
had
served
only
to
reveal
the
strangeness
of
the
intervening
country
each
fresh
observation
seemed
to
increase
the
of
his
ignorance
her
simplicity
of
outline
was
more
puzzling
than
a
complex
surface
one
may
conceivably
work
one
s
way
through
a
labyrinth
but
alexa
s
candor
was
like
a
plain
where
the
road
once
lost
there
are
no
landmarks
to
travel
by
dinner
over
they
returned
to
the
veranda
where
a
moon
rising
behind
the
old
elm
was
combining
with
that
complaisant
tree
a
romantic
enlargement
of
their
borders
glennard
had
forgotten
the
cigars
he
went
to
his
study
to
fetch
them
and
in
passing
through
the
he
saw
the
second
volume
of
the
letters
lying
open
on
his
wife
s
table
he
picked
up
the
book
and
looked
at
the
date
of
the
letter
she
had
been
reading
it
was
one
of
the
last
he
knew
the
few
lines
by
heart
he
dropped
the
book
and
leaned
against
the
wall
why
had
he
included
that
one
among
the
others
or
was
it
possible
that
now
they
would
all
seem
like
that
alexa
s
voice
came
suddenly
out
of
the
dusk
may
touchett
was
right
it
is
like
listening
at
a
i
wish
i
hadn
t
read
it
flamel
returned
in
the
leisurely
tone
of
the
man
whose
phrases
are
punctuated
by
a
cigarette
it
seems
so
to
us
perhaps
but
to
another
generation
the
book
will
be
a
then
it
ought
not
to
have
been
published
till
it
had
become
a
classic
it
s
horrible
it
s
degrading
almost
to
read
the
secrets
of
a
woman
one
might
have
she
added
in
a
lower
tone
stephen
did
know
her
did
he
came
from
flamel
he
knew
her
very
well
at
hillbridge
years
ago
the
book
has
made
him
feel
dreadfully
he
wouldn
t
read
it
he
didn
t
want
me
to
read
it
i
didn
t
understand
at
first
but
now
i
can
see
how
horribly
disloyal
it
must
seem
to
him
it
s
so
much
worse
to
surprise
a
friend
s
secrets
than
a
stranger
oh
glennard
s
such
a
sensitive
chap
flamel
said
easily
and
alexa
almost
rebukingly
rejoined
if
you
d
known
her
i
m
sure
you
d
feel
as
he
does
glennard
stood
motionless
overcome
by
the
singular
infelicity
with
which
he
had
contrived
to
put
flamel
in
possession
of
the
two
points
most
damaging
to
his
case
the
fact
that
he
had
been
a
friend
of
margaret
aubyn
s
and
that
he
had
concealed
from
alexa
his
share
in
the
publication
of
the
letters
to
a
man
of
less
than
flamel
s
astuteness
it
must
now
be
clear
to
whom
the
letters
were
addressed
and
the
possibility
once
suggested
nothing
could
be
easier
than
to
confirm
it
by
discreet
research
an
impulse
of
drove
glennard
to
the
window
why
not
anticipate
betrayal
by
telling
his
wife
the
truth
in
flamel
s
presence
if
the
man
had
a
drop
of
decent
feeling
in
him
such
a
course
would
be
the
surest
means
of
securing
his
silence
and
above
all
it
would
rid
glennard
of
the
necessity
of
defending
himself
against
the
perpetual
criticism
of
his
wife
s
belief
in
him
the
impulse
was
strong
enough
to
carry
him
to
the
window
but
there
a
reaction
of
defiance
set
in
what
had
he
done
after
all
to
need
defence
and
explanation
both
dresham
and
flamel
had
in
his
hearing
declared
the
publication
of
the
letters
to
be
not
only
justifiable
but
obligatory
and
if
the
disinterestedness
of
flamel
s
verdict
might
be
questioned
dresham
s
at
least
represented
the
impartial
view
of
the
man
of
letters
as
to
alexa
s
words
they
were
simply
the
conventional
utterance
of
the
nice
woman
on
a
question
already
decided
for
her
by
other
nice
women
she
had
said
the
proper
thing
as
mechanically
as
she
would
have
put
on
the
appropriate
gown
or
written
the
correct
form
of
glennard
had
small
faith
in
the
abstract
judgments
of
the
other
sex
he
knew
that
half
the
women
who
were
horrified
by
the
publication
of
aubyn
s
letters
would
have
betrayed
her
secrets
without
a
scruple
the
sudden
lowering
of
his
emotional
pitch
brought
a
proportionate
relief
he
told
himself
that
now
the
worst
was
over
and
things
would
fall
into
perspective
again
his
wife
and
flamel
had
turned
to
other
topics
and
coming
out
on
the
veranda
he
handed
the
cigars
to
flamel
saying
cheerfully
and
yet
he
could
have
sworn
they
were
the
last
words
he
meant
to
utter
look
here
old
man
before
you
go
down
to
newport
you
must
come
out
and
spend
a
few
days
with
us
mustn
t
he
alexa
viii
glennard
had
perhaps
unconsciously
counted
on
the
continuance
of
this
easier
mood
he
had
always
taken
pride
in
a
certain
robustness
of
fibre
that
enabled
him
to
harden
himself
against
the
inevitable
to
convert
his
failures
into
the
building
materials
of
success
though
it
did
not
even
now
occur
to
him
that
what
he
called
the
inevitable
had
hitherto
been
the
alternative
he
happened
to
prefer
he
was
yet
obscurely
aware
that
his
present
difficulty
was
one
not
to
be
conjured
by
any
affectation
of
indifference
some
griefs
build
the
soul
a
spacious
house
but
in
this
misery
of
glennard
s
he
could
not
stand
upright
it
pressed
against
him
at
every
turn
he
told
himself
that
this
was
because
there
was
no
escape
from
the
visible
evidences
of
his
act
the
letters
confronted
him
everywhere
people
who
had
never
opened
a
book
discussed
them
with
critical
reservations
to
have
read
them
had
become
a
social
obligation
in
circles
to
which
literature
never
penetrates
except
in
a
personal
guise
glennard
did
himself
injustice
it
was
from
the
unexpected
discovery
of
his
own
pettiness
that
he
chiefly
suffered
our
is
apt
to
be
based
on
the
hypothetical
great
act
we
have
never
had
occasion
to
perform
and
even
the
most
modesty
credits
itself
negatively
with
a
high
standard
of
conduct
glennard
had
never
thought
himself
a
hero
but
he
had
been
certain
that
he
was
incapable
of
baseness
we
all
like
our
to
have
a
becoming
cut
to
be
made
to
order
as
it
were
and
glennard
found
himself
suddenly
thrust
into
a
garb
of
dishonor
surely
meant
for
a
meaner
figure
the
immediate
result
of
his
first
weeks
of
wretchedness
was
the
resolve
to
go
to
town
for
the
winter
he
knew
that
such
a
course
was
just
beyond
the
limit
of
prudence
but
it
was
easy
to
allay
the
fears
of
alexa
who
scrupulously
vigilant
in
the
management
of
the
household
preserved
the
american
wife
s
usual
aloofness
from
her
husband
s
business
cares
glennard
felt
that
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
a
winter
s
solitude
with
her
he
had
an
unspeakable
dread
of
her
learning
the
truth
about
the
letters
yet
could
not
be
sure
of
steeling
himself
against
the
suicidal
impulse
of
avowal
his
very
soul
was
parched
for
sympathy
he
thirsted
for
a
voice
of
pity
and
comprehension
but
would
his
wife
pity
would
she
understand
again
he
found
himself
brought
up
abruptly
against
his
incredible
ignorance
of
her
nature
the
fact
that
he
knew
well
enough
how
she
would
behave
in
the
ordinary
emergencies
of
life
that
he
could
count
in
such
contingencies
on
the
kind
of
high
courage
and
directness
he
had
always
divined
in
her
made
him
the
more
hopeless
of
her
entering
into
the
torturous
psychology
of
an
act
that
he
himself
could
no
longer
explain
or
understand
it
would
have
been
easier
had
she
been
more
complex
more
feminine
if
he
could
have
counted
on
her
imaginative
sympathy
or
her
moral
obtuseness
but
he
was
sure
of
neither
he
was
sure
of
nothing
but
that
for
a
time
he
must
avoid
her
glennard
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
delusion
that
by
and
by
his
action
would
cease
to
make
its
consequences
felt
he
would
not
have
cared
to
own
to
himself
that
he
counted
on
the
dulling
of
his
sensibilities
he
preferred
to
indulge
the
vague
hypothesis
that
extraneous
circumstances
would
somehow
efface
the
blot
upon
his
conscience
in
his
worst
moments
of
he
tried
to
find
solace
in
the
thought
that
flamel
had
sanctioned
his
course
flamel
at
the
outset
must
have
guessed
to
whom
the
letters
were
addressed
yet
neither
then
nor
afterward
had
he
hesitated
to
advise
their
publication
this
thought
drew
glennard
to
him
in
fitful
impulses
of
friendliness
from
each
of
which
there
was
a
sharper
reaction
of
distrust
and
aversion
when
flamel
was
not
at
the
house
he
missed
the
support
of
his
tacit
connivance
when
he
was
there
his
presence
seemed
the
assertion
of
an
intolerable
claim
early
in
the
winter
the
glennards
took
possession
of
the
little
house
that
was
to
cost
them
almost
nothing
the
change
brought
glennard
the
immediate
relief
of
seeing
less
of
his
wife
and
of
being
protected
in
her
presence
by
the
multiplied
preoccupations
of
town
life
alexa
who
could
never
appear
hurried
showed
the
smiling
abstraction
of
a
pretty
woman
to
whom
the
social
side
of
married
life
has
not
lost
its
novelty
glennard
with
the
recklessness
of
a
man
fresh
from
his
first
financial
imprudence
encouraged
her
in
such
little
extravagances
as
her
good
sense
at
first
resisted
since
they
had
come
to
town
he
argued
they
might
as
well
enjoy
themselves
he
took
a
sympathetic
view
of
the
necessity
of
new
gowns
he
gave
her
a
set
of
furs
at
christmas
and
before
the
new
year
they
had
agreed
on
the
obligation
of
adding
a
to
their
small
establishment
providence
the
very
next
day
hastened
to
justify
this
measure
by
placing
on
glennard
s
an
envelope
bearing
the
name
of
the
publishers
to
whom
he
had
sold
aubyn
s
letters
it
happened
to
be
the
only
letter
the
early
post
had
brought
and
he
glanced
across
the
table
at
his
wife
who
had
come
down
before
him
and
had
probably
laid
the
envelope
on
his
plate
she
was
not
the
woman
to
ask
awkward
questions
but
he
felt
the
conjecture
of
her
glance
and
he
was
debating
whether
to
affect
surprise
at
the
receipt
of
the
letter
or
to
pass
it
off
as
a
business
communication
that
had
strayed
to
his
house
when
a
check
fell
from
the
envelope
it
was
the
royalty
on
the
first
edition
of
the
letters
his
first
feeling
was
one
of
simple
satisfaction
the
money
had
come
with
such
infernal
opportuneness
that
he
could
not
help
welcoming
it
before
long
too
there
would
be
more
he
knew
the
book
was
still
selling
far
beyond
the
publisher
s
previsions
he
put
the
check
in
his
pocket
and
left
the
room
without
looking
at
his
wife
on
the
way
to
his
office
the
habitual
reaction
set
in
the
money
he
had
received
was
the
first
tangible
reminder
that
he
was
living
on
the
sale
of
his
the
thought
of
material
benefit
had
been
overshadowed
by
his
sense
of
the
intrinsic
baseness
of
making
the
letters
known
now
he
saw
what
an
element
of
sordidness
it
added
to
the
situation
and
how
the
fact
that
he
needed
the
money
and
must
use
it
pledged
him
more
irrevocably
than
ever
to
the
consequences
of
his
act
it
seemed
to
him
in
that
first
hour
of
misery
that
he
had
betrayed
his
friend
anew
when
that
afternoon
he
reached
home
earlier
than
usual
alexa
s
was
full
of
a
gayety
that
overflowed
to
the
stairs
flamel
for
a
wonder
was
not
there
but
dresham
and
young
hartly
grouped
about
the
were
receiving
with
resonant
mirth
a
narrative
delivered
in
the
fluttered
staccato
that
made
armiger
s
conversation
like
the
ejaculations
of
a
startled
aviary
she
paused
as
glennard
entered
and
he
had
time
to
notice
that
his
wife
who
was
busied
about
the
had
not
joined
in
the
laughter
of
the
men
oh
go
on
go
on
young
hartly
rapturously
groaned
and
armiger
met
glennard
s
inquiry
with
the
deprecating
cry
that
really
she
didn
t
see
what
there
was
to
laugh
at
i
m
sure
i
feel
more
like
crying
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
have
done
if
alexa
hadn
t
been
home
to
give
me
a
cup
of
tea
my
nerves
are
in
shreds
yes
another
dear
please
and
as
glennard
looked
his
perplexity
she
went
on
after
pondering
on
the
selection
of
a
second
lump
of
sugar
why
i
ve
just
come
from
the
reading
you
know
the
reading
at
the
i
haven
t
been
in
town
long
enough
to
know
anything
said
glennard
taking
the
cup
his
wife
handed
him
who
has
been
reading
what
that
lovely
girl
from
the
south
georgie
georgie
what
s
her
name
dresham
s
protegee
unless
she
s
yours
dresham
why
the
big
was
packed
and
all
the
women
were
crying
like
idiots
it
was
the
most
harrowing
thing
i
ever
heard
what
did
you
hear
glennard
asked
and
his
wife
interposed
won
t
you
have
another
bit
of
cake
julia
or
stephen
ring
for
some
hot
toast
her
tone
betrayed
a
polite
satiety
of
the
topic
under
discussion
glennard
turned
to
the
bell
but
armiger
pursued
him
with
her
lovely
amazement
why
the
aubyn
letters
didn
t
you
know
about
it
the
girl
read
them
so
beautifully
that
it
was
quite
horrible
i
should
have
fainted
if
there
d
been
a
man
near
enough
to
carry
me
hartly
s
glee
redoubled
and
dresham
said
jovially
how
like
you
women
to
raise
a
shriek
over
the
book
and
then
do
all
you
can
to
encourage
the
blatant
publicity
of
the
readings
armiger
met
him
more
than
on
a
torrent
of
it
was
horrid
it
was
disgraceful
i
told
your
wife
we
ought
all
to
be
ashamed
of
ourselves
for
going
and
i
think
alexa
was
quite
right
to
refuse
to
take
any
tickets
even
if
it
was
for
a
oh
her
hostess
murmured
indifferently
with
me
charity
begins
at
home
i
can
t
afford
emotional
a
charity
a
charity
hartly
exulted
i
hadn
t
seized
the
full
beauty
of
it
reading
poor
margaret
aubyn
s
at
the
waldorf
before
five
hundred
people
for
a
charity
what
charity
dear
armiger
why
the
home
for
friendless
women
it
was
well
chosen
dresham
commented
and
hartly
buried
his
mirth
in
the
when
they
were
alone
glennard
still
holding
his
untouched
cup
of
tea
turned
to
his
wife
who
sat
silently
behind
the
kettle
who
asked
you
to
take
a
ticket
for
that
reading
i
don
t
know
really
kate
dresham
i
fancy
it
was
she
who
got
it
it
s
just
the
sort
of
damnable
vulgarity
she
s
capable
of
it
s
loathsome
it
s
monstrous
his
wife
without
looking
up
answered
gravely
i
thought
so
too
it
was
for
that
reason
i
didn
t
go
but
you
must
remember
that
very
few
people
feel
about
aubyn
as
you
do
glennard
managed
to
set
down
his
cup
with
a
steady
hand
but
the
room
swung
round
with
him
and
he
dropped
into
the
nearest
chair
as
i
do
he
repeated
i
mean
that
very
few
people
knew
her
when
she
lived
in
new
york
to
most
of
the
women
who
went
to
the
reading
she
was
a
mere
name
too
remote
to
have
any
personality
with
me
of
course
it
was
different
glennard
gave
her
a
startled
look
different
why
different
since
you
were
her
friend
her
friend
he
stood
up
impatiently
you
speak
as
if
she
had
had
only
one
the
most
famous
woman
of
her
day
he
moved
vaguely
about
the
room
bending
down
to
look
at
some
books
on
the
table
i
hope
he
added
you
didn
t
give
that
as
a
reason
by
the
way
a
reason
for
not
going
a
woman
who
gives
reasons
for
getting
out
of
social
obligations
is
sure
to
make
herself
unpopular
or
ridiculous
the
words
were
uncalculated
but
in
an
instant
he
saw
that
they
had
strangely
bridged
the
distance
between
his
wife
and
himself
he
felt
her
close
on
him
like
a
panting
foe
and
her
answer
was
a
flash
that
showed
the
hand
on
the
trigger
i
seem
she
said
from
the
threshold
to
have
done
both
in
giving
my
reason
to
the
fact
that
they
were
dining
out
that
evening
made
it
easy
for
him
to
avoid
alexa
till
she
came
downstairs
in
her
touchett
who
was
going
to
the
same
dinner
had
offered
to
call
for
her
and
glennard
refusing
a
precarious
seat
between
the
ladies
draperies
followed
on
foot
the
evening
was
interminable
the
reading
at
the
waldorf
at
which
all
the
women
had
been
present
had
revived
the
discussion
of
the
aubyn
letters
and
glennard
hearing
his
wife
questioned
as
to
her
absence
felt
himself
miserably
wishing
that
she
had
gone
rather
than
that
her
staying
away
should
have
been
remarked
he
was
rapidly
losing
all
sense
of
proportion
where
the
letters
were
concerned
he
could
no
longer
hear
them
mentioned
without
suspecting
a
purpose
in
the
allusion
he
even
yielded
himself
for
a
moment
to
the
extravagance
of
imagining
that
dresham
whom
he
disliked
had
organized
the
reading
in
the
hope
of
making
him
betray
himself
for
he
was
already
sure
that
dresham
had
divined
his
share
in
the
transaction
the
attempt
to
keep
a
smooth
surface
on
this
inner
tumult
was
as
endless
and
unavailing
as
efforts
made
in
a
nightmare
he
lost
all
sense
of
what
he
was
saying
to
his
neighbors
and
once
when
he
looked
up
his
wife
s
glance
struck
him
cold
she
sat
nearly
opposite
him
at
flamel
s
side
and
it
appeared
to
glennard
that
they
had
built
about
themselves
one
of
those
airy
barriers
of
talk
behind
which
two
people
can
say
what
they
please
while
the
reading
was
discussed
they
were
silent
their
silence
seemed
to
glennard
almost
cynical
it
stripped
the
last
disguise
from
their
complicity
a
throb
of
anger
rose
in
him
but
suddenly
it
fell
and
he
felt
with
a
curious
sense
of
relief
that
at
bottom
he
no
longer
cared
whether
flamel
had
told
his
wife
or
not
the
assumption
that
flamel
knew
about
the
letters
had
become
a
fact
to
glennard
and
it
now
seemed
to
him
better
that
alexa
should
know
too
he
was
frightened
at
first
by
the
discovery
of
his
own
indifference
the
last
barriers
of
his
will
seemed
to
be
breaking
down
before
a
flood
of
moral
lassitude
how
could
he
continue
to
play
his
part
to
keep
his
front
to
the
enemy
with
this
poison
of
indifference
stealing
through
his
veins
he
tried
to
brace
himself
with
the
remembrance
of
his
wife
s
scorn
he
had
not
forgotten
the
note
on
which
their
conversation
had
closed
if
he
had
ever
wondered
how
she
would
receive
the
truth
he
wondered
no
longer
she
would
despise
him
but
this
lent
a
new
insidiousness
to
his
temptation
since
her
contempt
would
be
a
refuge
from
his
own
he
said
to
himself
that
since
he
no
longer
cared
for
the
consequences
he
could
at
least
acquit
himself
of
speaking
in
what
he
wanted
now
was
not
immunity
but
castigation
his
wife
s
indignation
might
still
reconcile
him
to
himself
therein
lay
his
one
hope
of
regeneration
her
scorn
was
the
moral
antiseptic
that
he
needed
her
comprehension
the
one
balm
that
could
heal
him
when
they
left
the
dinner
he
was
so
afraid
of
speaking
that
he
let
her
drive
home
alone
and
went
to
the
club
with
flamel
ix
he
rose
next
morning
with
the
resolve
to
know
what
alexa
thought
of
him
it
was
not
anchoring
in
a
haven
but
lying
to
in
a
storm
he
felt
the
need
of
a
temporary
lull
in
the
turmoil
of
his
sensations
he
came
home
late
for
they
were
dining
alone
and
he
knew
that
they
would
have
the
evening
together
when
he
followed
her
to
the
after
dinner
he
thought
himself
on
the
point
of
speaking
but
as
she
handed
him
his
coffee
he
said
involuntarily
i
shall
have
to
carry
this
off
to
the
study
i
ve
got
a
lot
of
work
alone
in
the
study
he
cursed
his
cowardice
what
was
it
that
had
withheld
him
a
certain
bright
unapproachableness
seemed
to
keep
him
at
arm
s
length
she
was
not
the
kind
of
woman
whose
compassion
could
be
circumvented
there
was
no
chance
of
slipping
past
the
outposts
he
would
never
take
her
by
surprise
well
why
not
face
her
then
what
he
shrank
from
could
be
no
worse
than
what
he
was
enduring
he
had
pushed
back
his
chair
and
turned
to
go
upstairs
when
a
new
expedient
presented
itself
what
if
instead
of
telling
her
he
were
to
let
her
find
out
for
herself
and
watch
the
effect
of
the
discovery
before
speaking
in
this
way
he
made
over
to
chance
the
burden
of
the
revelation
the
idea
had
been
suggested
by
the
sight
of
the
formula
enclosing
the
publisher
s
check
he
had
deposited
the
money
but
the
notice
accompanying
it
dropped
from
his
as
he
cleared
his
table
for
work
it
was
the
formula
usual
in
such
cases
and
revealed
clearly
enough
that
he
was
the
recipient
of
a
royalty
on
margaret
aubyn
s
letters
it
would
be
impossible
for
alexa
to
read
it
without
understanding
at
once
that
the
letters
had
been
written
to
him
and
that
he
had
sold
them
he
sat
downstairs
till
he
heard
her
ring
for
the
to
put
out
the
lights
then
he
went
up
to
the
with
a
bundle
of
papers
in
his
hand
alexa
was
just
rising
from
her
seat
and
the
lamplight
fell
on
the
deep
roll
of
hair
that
overhung
her
brow
like
the
eaves
of
a
temple
her
face
had
often
the
high
secluded
look
of
a
shrine
and
it
was
this
touch
of
awe
in
her
beauty
that
now
made
him
feel
himself
on
the
brink
of
sacrilege
lest
the
feeling
should
dominate
him
he
spoke
at
once
i
ve
brought
you
a
piece
of
work
a
lot
of
old
bills
and
things
that
i
want
you
to
sort
for
me
some
are
not
worth
keeping
but
you
ll
be
able
to
judge
of
that
there
may
be
a
letter
or
two
among
them
nothing
of
much
account
but
i
don
t
like
to
throw
away
the
whole
lot
without
having
them
looked
over
and
i
haven
t
time
to
do
it
he
held
out
the
papers
and
she
took
them
with
a
smile
that
seemed
to
recognize
in
the
service
he
asked
the
tacit
intention
of
making
amends
for
the
incident
of
the
previous
day
are
you
sure
i
shall
know
which
to
keep
oh
quite
sure
he
answered
easily
and
besides
none
are
of
much
the
next
morning
he
invented
an
excuse
for
leaving
the
house
without
seeing
her
and
when
he
returned
just
before
dinner
he
found
a
visitor
s
hat
and
stick
in
the
hall
the
visitor
was
flamel
who
was
in
the
act
of
taking
leave
he
had
risen
but
alexa
remained
seated
and
their
attitude
gave
the
impression
of
a
colloquy
that
had
prolonged
itself
beyond
the
limits
of
speech
both
turned
a
surprised
eye
on
glennard
and
he
had
the
sense
of
walking
into
a
room
grown
suddenly
empty
as
though
their
thoughts
were
conspirators
dispersed
by
his
approach
he
felt
the
clutch
of
his
old
fear
what
if
his
wife
had
already
sorted
the
papers
and
had
told
flamel
of
her
discovery
well
it
was
no
news
to
flamel
that
glennard
was
in
receipt
of
a
royalty
on
the
aubyn
a
sudden
resolve
to
know
the
worst
made
him
lift
his
eyes
to
his
wife
as
the
door
closed
on
flamel
but
alexa
had
risen
also
and
bending
over
her
with
her
back
to
glennard
was
beginning
to
speak
precipitately
i
m
dining
out
you
don
t
mind
my
deserting
you
julia
armiger
sent
me
word
just
now
that
she
had
an
extra
ticket
for
the
last
ambrose
concert
she
told
me
to
say
how
sorry
she
was
that
she
hadn
t
two
but
i
knew
you
wouldn
t
be
sorry
she
ended
with
a
laugh
that
had
the
effect
of
being
a
strayed
echo
of
armiger
s
and
before
glennard
could
speak
she
had
added
with
her
hand
on
the
door
mr
flamel
stayed
so
late
that
i
ve
hardly
time
to
dress
the
concert
begins
ridiculously
early
and
julia
dines
at
seven
glennard
stood
alone
in
the
empty
room
that
seemed
somehow
full
of
an
ironical
consciousness
of
what
was
happening
she
hates
me
he
murmured
she
hates
me
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
glennard
purposely
lingered
late
in
his
room
when
he
came
downstairs
his
wife
was
already
seated
at
the
she
lifted
her
usual
smile
to
his
entrance
and
they
took
shelter
in
the
nearest
topic
like
wayfarers
overtaken
by
a
storm
while
he
listened
to
her
account
of
the
concert
he
began
to
think
that
after
all
she
had
not
yet
sorted
the
papers
and
that
her
agitation
of
the
previous
day
must
be
ascribed
to
another
cause
in
which
perhaps
he
had
but
an
indirect
concern
he
wondered
it
had
never
before
occurred
to
him
that
flamel
was
the
kind
of
man
who
might
very
well
please
a
woman
at
his
own
expense
without
need
of
fortuitous
assistance
if
this
possibility
cleared
the
outlook
it
did
not
brighten
it
glennard
merely
felt
himself
left
alone
with
his
baseness
alexa
left
the
before
him
and
when
he
went
up
to
the
he
found
her
dressed
to
go
out
aren
t
you
a
little
early
for
church
he
asked
she
replied
that
on
the
way
there
she
meant
to
stop
a
moment
at
her
mother
s
and
while
she
drew
on
her
gloves
he
fumbled
among
the
on
the
for
a
match
to
light
his
cigarette
well
she
said
turning
to
go
and
from
the
threshold
she
added
by
the
way
i
ve
sorted
the
papers
you
gave
me
those
that
i
thought
you
would
like
to
keep
are
on
your
she
went
downstairs
and
he
heard
the
door
close
behind
her
she
had
sorted
the
papers
she
knew
then
she
must
know
and
she
had
made
no
sign
glennard
he
hardly
knew
how
found
himself
once
more
in
the
study
on
the
table
lay
the
packet
he
had
given
her
it
was
much
smaller
she
had
evidently
gone
over
the
papers
with
care
destroying
the
greater
number
he
loosened
the
elastic
band
and
spread
the
remaining
envelopes
on
his
desk
the
publisher
s
notice
was
among
them
x
his
wife
knew
and
she
made
no
sign
glennard
found
himself
in
the
case
of
the
seafarer
who
closing
his
eyes
at
nightfall
on
a
scene
he
thinks
to
put
leagues
behind
him
before
day
wakes
to
a
framing
the
same
patch
of
shore
from
the
kind
of
exaltation
to
which
his
resolve
had
lifted
him
he
dropped
to
an
unreasoning
apathy
his
impulse
of
confession
had
acted
as
a
drug
to
he
had
tried
to
shift
a
portion
of
his
burden
to
his
wife
s
shoulders
and
now
that
she
had
tacitly
refused
to
carry
it
he
felt
the
load
too
heavy
to
be
taken
up
again
a
fortunate
interval
of
hard
work
brought
respite
from
this
phase
of
sterile
misery
he
went
west
to
argue
an
important
case
won
it
and
came
back
to
fresh
preoccupations
his
own
affairs
were
thriving
enough
to
engross
him
in
the
pauses
of
his
professional
work
and
for
over
two
months
he
had
little
time
to
look
himself
in
the
face
not
unnaturally
for
he
was
as
yet
unskilled
in
the
subtleties
of
introspection
he
mistook
his
temporary
insensibility
for
a
gradual
revival
of
moral
health
he
told
himself
that
he
was
recovering
his
sense
of
proportion
getting
to
see
things
in
their
true
light
and
if
he
now
thought
of
his
rash
appeal
to
his
wife
s
sympathy
it
was
as
an
act
of
folly
from
the
consequences
of
which
he
had
been
saved
by
the
providence
that
watches
over
madmen
he
had
little
leisure
to
observe
alexa
but
he
concluded
that
the
momentarily
denied
him
had
counselled
her
uncritical
acceptance
of
the
inevitable
if
such
a
quality
was
a
poor
substitute
for
the
passionate
justness
that
had
once
seemed
to
characterize
her
he
accepted
the
alternative
as
a
part
of
that
general
lowering
of
the
key
that
seems
needful
to
the
maintenance
of
the
matrimonial
duet
what
woman
ever
retained
her
abstract
sense
of
justice
where
another
woman
was
concerned
possibly
the
thought
that
he
had
profited
by
aubyn
s
tenderness
was
not
wholly
disagreeable
to
his
wife
when
the
pressure
of
work
began
to
lessen
and
he
found
himself
in
the
lengthening
afternoons
able
to
reach
home
somewhat
earlier
he
noticed
that
the
little
was
always
full
and
that
he
and
his
wife
seldom
had
an
evening
alone
together
when
he
was
tired
as
often
happened
she
went
out
alone
the
idea
of
giving
up
an
engagement
to
remain
with
him
seemed
not
to
occur
to
her
she
had
shown
as
a
girl
little
fondness
for
society
nor
had
she
seemed
to
regret
it
during
the
year
they
had
spent
in
the
country
he
reflected
however
that
he
was
sharing
the
common
lot
of
husbands
who
proverbially
mistake
the
early
ardors
of
housekeeping
for
a
sign
of
settled
domesticity
alexa
at
any
rate
was
refuting
his
theory
as
inconsiderately
as
a
seedling
defeats
the
gardener
s
expectations
an
undefinable
change
had
come
over
her
in
one
sense
it
was
a
happy
one
since
she
had
grown
if
not
handsomer
at
least
more
vivid
and
expressive
her
beauty
had
become
more
communicable
it
was
as
though
she
had
learned
the
conscious
exercise
of
intuitive
attributes
and
now
used
her
effects
with
the
discrimination
of
an
artist
skilled
in
values
to
a
dispassionate
critic
as
glennard
now
rated
himself
the
art
may
at
times
have
been
a
little
too
obvious
her
attempts
at
lightness
lacked
spontaneity
and
she
sometimes
rasped
him
by
laughing
like
julia
armiger
but
he
had
enough
imagination
to
perceive
that
in
respect
of
the
wife
s
social
arts
a
husband
necessarily
sees
the
wrong
side
of
the
tapestry
in
this
ironical
estimate
of
their
relation
glennard
found
himself
strangely
relieved
of
all
concern
as
to
his
wife
s
feelings
for
flamel
from
an
olympian
pinnacle
of
indifference
he
calmly
surveyed
their
inoffensive
antics
it
was
surprising
how
his
cheapening
of
his
wife
put
him
at
ease
with
himself
far
as
he
and
she
were
from
each
other
they
yet
had
in
a
sense
the
tacit
nearness
of
complicity
yes
they
were
accomplices
he
could
no
more
be
jealous
of
her
than
she
could
despise
him
the
jealousy
that
would
once
have
seemed
a
blur
on
her
whiteness
now
appeared
like
a
tribute
to
ideals
in
which
he
no
longer
believed
glennard
was
little
given
to
exploring
the
outskirts
of
literature
he
always
skipped
the
literary
notices
in
the
papers
and
he
had
small
leisure
for
the
intermittent
pleasures
of
the
periodical
he
had
therefore
no
notion
of
the
prolonged
reverberations
which
the
aubyn
letters
had
awakened
in
the
precincts
of
criticism
when
the
book
ceased
to
be
talked
about
he
supposed
it
had
ceased
to
be
read
and
this
apparent
subsidence
of
the
agitation
about
it
brought
the
reassuring
sense
that
he
had
exaggerated
its
vitality
the
conviction
if
it
did
not
ease
his
conscience
at
least
offered
him
the
relative
relief
of
obscurity
he
felt
like
an
offender
taken
down
from
the
pillory
and
thrust
into
the
soothing
darkness
of
a
cell
but
one
evening
when
alexa
had
left
him
to
go
to
a
dance
he
chanced
to
turn
over
the
magazines
on
her
table
and
the
copy
of
the
horoscope
to
which
he
settled
down
with
his
cigar
confronted
him
on
its
first
page
with
a
portrait
of
margaret
aubyn
it
was
a
reproduction
of
the
photograph
that
had
stood
so
long
on
his
desk
the
desiccating
air
of
memory
had
turned
her
into
the
mere
abstraction
of
a
woman
and
this
unexpected
evocation
seemed
to
bring
her
nearer
than
she
had
ever
been
in
life
was
it
because
he
understood
her
better
he
looked
long
into
her
eyes
little
personal
traits
reached
out
to
him
like
caresses
the
tired
droop
of
her
lids
her
quick
way
of
leaning
forward
as
she
spoke
the
movements
of
her
long
expressive
hands
all
that
was
feminine
in
her
the
quality
he
had
always
missed
stole
toward
him
from
her
unreproachful
gaze
and
now
that
it
was
too
late
life
had
developed
in
him
the
subtler
perceptions
which
could
detect
it
in
even
this
poor
semblance
of
herself
for
a
moment
he
found
consolation
in
the
thought
that
at
any
cost
they
had
thus
been
brought
together
then
a
flood
of
shame
rushed
over
him
face
to
face
with
her
he
felt
himself
laid
bare
to
the
inmost
fold
of
consciousness
the
shame
was
deep
but
it
was
a
renovating
anguish
he
was
like
a
man
whom
intolerable
pain
has
roused
from
the
creeping
lethargy
of
death
he
rose
next
morning
to
as
fresh
a
sense
of
life
as
though
his
hour
of
mute
communion
with
margaret
aubyn
had
been
a
more
exquisite
renewal
of
their
earlier
meetings
his
waking
thought
was
that
he
must
see
her
again
and
as
consciousness
affirmed
itself
he
felt
an
intense
fear
of
losing
the
sense
of
her
nearness
but
she
was
still
close
to
him
her
presence
remained
the
sole
reality
in
a
world
of
shadows
all
through
his
working
hours
he
was
with
incredible
minuteness
every
incident
of
their
obliterated
past
as
a
man
who
has
mastered
the
spirit
of
a
foreign
tongue
turns
with
renewed
wonder
to
the
pages
his
youth
has
plodded
over
in
this
lucidity
of
retrospection
the
most
trivial
detail
had
its
significance
and
the
rapture
of
recovery
was
embittered
to
glennard
by
the
perception
of
all
that
he
had
missed
he
had
been
pitiably
grotesquely
stupid
and
there
was
irony
in
the
thought
that
but
for
the
crisis
through
which
he
was
passing
he
might
have
lived
on
in
complacent
ignorance
of
his
loss
it
was
as
though
she
had
bought
him
with
her
blood
that
evening
he
and
alexa
dined
alone
after
dinner
he
followed
her
to
the
he
no
longer
felt
the
need
of
avoiding
her
he
was
hardly
conscious
of
her
presence
after
a
few
words
they
lapsed
into
silence
and
he
sat
smoking
with
his
eyes
on
the
fire
it
was
not
that
he
was
unwilling
to
talk
to
her
he
felt
a
curious
desire
to
be
as
kind
as
possible
but
he
was
always
forgetting
that
she
was
there
her
full
bright
presence
through
which
the
currents
of
life
flowed
so
warmly
had
grown
as
tenuous
as
a
shadow
and
he
saw
so
far
beyond
her
presently
she
rose
and
began
to
move
about
the
room
she
seemed
to
be
looking
for
something
and
he
roused
himself
to
ask
what
she
wanted
only
the
last
number
of
the
horoscope
i
thought
i
d
left
it
on
this
he
said
nothing
and
she
went
on
you
haven
t
seen
it
no
he
returned
coldly
the
magazine
was
locked
in
his
desk
his
wife
had
moved
to
the
she
stood
facing
him
and
as
he
looked
up
he
met
her
tentative
gaze
i
was
reading
an
article
in
it
a
review
of
aubyn
s
letters
she
added
slowly
with
her
deep
deliberate
blush
glennard
stooped
to
toss
his
cigar
into
the
fire
he
felt
a
savage
wish
that
she
would
not
speak
the
other
woman
s
name
nothing
else
seemed
to
matter
you
seem
to
do
a
lot
of
reading
he
said
she
still
earnestly
confronted
him
i
was
keeping
this
for
you
i
thought
it
might
interest
you
she
said
with
an
air
of
gentle
insistence
he
stood
up
and
turned
away
he
was
sure
she
knew
that
he
had
taken
the
review
and
he
felt
that
he
was
beginning
to
hate
her
again
i
haven
t
time
for
such
things
he
said
indifferently
as
he
moved
to
the
door
he
heard
her
take
a
precipitate
step
forward
then
she
paused
and
sank
without
speaking
into
the
chair
from
which
he
had
risen
xi
as
glennard
in
the
raw
february
sunlight
mounted
the
road
to
the
cemetery
he
felt
the
beatitude
that
comes
with
an
abrupt
cessation
of
physical
pain
he
had
reached
the
point
where
ceases
the
impulse
that
moved
him
was
purely
intuitive
he
did
not
even
seek
a
reason
for
it
beyond
the
obvious
one
that
his
desire
to
stand
by
margaret
aubyn
s
grave
was
prompted
by
no
attempt
at
a
sentimental
reparation
but
rather
by
the
vague
need
to
affirm
in
some
way
the
reality
of
the
tie
between
them
the
ironical
promiscuity
of
death
had
brought
aubyn
back
to
share
the
narrow
hospitality
of
her
husband
s
last
lodging
but
though
glennard
knew
she
had
been
buried
near
new
york
he
had
never
visited
her
grave
he
was
oppressed
as
he
now
threaded
the
long
avenues
by
a
chilling
vision
of
her
return
there
was
no
family
to
follow
her
hearse
she
had
died
alone
as
she
had
lived
and
the
distinguished
mourners
who
had
formed
the
escort
of
the
famous
writer
knew
nothing
of
the
woman
they
were
committing
to
the
grave
glennard
could
not
even
remember
at
what
season
she
had
been
buried
but
his
mood
indulged
the
fancy
that
it
must
have
been
on
some
such
day
of
harsh
sunlight
the
incisive
february
brightness
that
gives
perspicuity
without
warmth
the
white
avenues
stretched
before
him
interminably
lined
with
stereotyped
emblems
of
affliction
as
though
all
the
platitudes
ever
uttered
had
been
turned
to
marble
and
set
up
over
the
unresisting
dead
here
and
there
no
doubt
a
frigid
urn
or
an
insipid
angel
imprisoned
some
grief
as
the
most
hackneyed
words
may
become
the
vehicle
of
rare
meanings
but
for
the
most
part
the
endless
alignment
of
monuments
seemed
to
embody
those
easy
generalizations
about
death
that
do
not
disturb
the
repose
of
the
living
glennard
s
eye
as
he
followed
the
way
indicated
to
him
had
instinctively
sought
some
low
mound
with
a
quiet
headstone
he
had
forgotten
that
the
dead
seldom
plan
their
own
houses
and
with
a
pang
he
discovered
the
name
he
sought
on
the
cyclopean
base
of
a
granite
shaft
rearing
its
aggressive
height
at
the
angle
of
two
avenues
how
she
would
have
hated
it
he
murmured
a
bench
stood
near
and
he
seated
himself
the
monument
rose
before
him
like
some
pretentious
uninhabited
dwelling
he
could
not
believe
that
margaret
aubyn
lay
there
it
was
a
sunday
morning
and
black
figures
moved
among
the
paths
placing
flowers
on
the
hillocks
glennard
noticed
that
the
neighboring
graves
had
been
thus
newly
dressed
and
he
fancied
a
blind
stir
of
expectancy
through
the
sod
as
though
the
bare
mounds
spread
a
parched
surface
to
that
commemorative
rain
he
rose
presently
and
walked
back
to
the
entrance
of
the
cemetery
several
greenhouses
stood
near
the
gates
and
turning
in
at
the
first
he
asked
for
some
flowers
anything
in
the
emblematic
line
asked
the
anaemic
man
behind
the
dripping
counter
glennard
shook
his
head
just
cut
flowers
this
way
the
florist
unlocked
a
glass
door
and
led
him
down
a
moist
green
aisle
the
hot
air
was
choked
with
the
scent
of
white
azaleas
white
lilies
white
lilacs
all
the
flowers
were
white
they
were
like
a
prolongation
a
mystical
efflorescence
of
the
long
rows
of
marble
tombstones
and
their
perfume
seemed
to
cover
an
odor
of
decay
the
rich
atmosphere
made
glennard
dizzy
as
he
leaned
in
the
doorpost
waiting
for
the
flowers
he
had
a
penetrating
sense
of
margaret
aubyn
s
nearness
not
the
imponderable
presence
of
his
inner
vision
but
a
life
that
beat
warm
in
his
arms
the
sharp
air
caught
him
as
he
stepped
out
into
it
again
he
walked
back
and
scattered
the
flowers
over
the
grave
the
edges
of
the
white
petals
shrivelled
like
burnt
paper
in
the
cold
and
as
he
watched
them
the
illusion
of
her
nearness
faded
shrank
back
frozen
xii
the
motive
of
his
visit
to
the
cemetery
remained
undefined
save
as
a
final
effort
of
escape
from
his
wife
s
inexpressive
acceptance
of
his
shame
it
seemed
to
him
that
as
long
as
he
could
keep
himself
alive
to
that
shame
he
would
not
wholly
have
succumbed
to
its
consequences
his
chief
fear
was
that
he
should
become
the
creature
of
his
act
his
wife
s
indifference
degraded
him
it
seemed
to
put
him
on
a
level
with
his
dishonor
margaret
aubyn
would
have
abhorred
the
deed
in
proportion
to
her
pity
for
the
man
the
sense
of
her
potential
pity
drew
him
back
to
her
the
one
woman
knew
but
did
not
understand
the
other
it
sometimes
seemed
understood
without
knowing
in
its
last
disguise
of
retrospective
remorse
his
affected
a
desire
for
solitude
and
meditation
he
lost
himself
in
morbid
musings
in
futile
visions
of
what
life
with
margaret
aubyn
might
have
been
there
were
moments
when
in
the
strange
dislocation
of
his
view
the
wrong
he
had
done
her
seemed
a
tie
between
them
to
indulge
these
emotions
he
fell
into
the
habit
on
sunday
afternoons
of
solitary
walks
prolonged
till
after
dusk
the
days
were
lengthening
there
was
a
touch
of
spring
in
the
air
and
his
wanderings
now
usually
led
him
to
the
park
and
its
outlying
regions
one
sunday
tired
of
aimless
locomotion
he
took
a
cab
at
the
park
gates
and
let
it
carry
him
out
to
the
riverside
drive
it
was
a
gray
afternoon
streaked
with
east
wind
glennard
s
cab
advanced
slowly
and
as
he
leaned
back
gazing
with
absent
intentness
at
the
deserted
paths
that
wound
under
bare
boughs
between
grass
banks
of
premature
vividness
his
attention
was
arrested
by
two
figures
walking
ahead
of
him
this
couple
who
had
the
path
to
themselves
moved
at
an
uneven
pace
as
though
adapting
their
gait
to
a
conversation
marked
by
meditative
intervals
now
and
then
they
paused
and
in
one
of
these
pauses
the
lady
turning
toward
her
companion
showed
glennard
the
outline
of
his
wife
s
profile
the
man
was
flamel
the
blood
rushed
to
glennard
s
forehead
he
sat
up
with
a
jerk
and
pushed
back
the
lid
in
the
roof
of
the
hansom
but
when
the
cabman
bent
down
he
dropped
into
his
seat
without
speaking
then
becoming
conscious
of
the
prolonged
interrogation
of
the
lifted
lid
he
called
out
turn
drive
back
anywhere
i
m
in
a
hurry
as
the
cab
swung
round
he
caught
a
last
glimpse
of
the
two
figures
they
had
not
moved
alexa
with
bent
head
stood
listening
my
god
my
god
he
groaned
it
was
hideous
it
was
abominable
he
could
not
understand
it
the
woman
was
nothing
to
him
less
than
nothing
yet
the
blood
hummed
in
his
ears
and
hung
a
cloud
before
him
he
knew
it
was
only
the
stirring
of
the
primal
instinct
that
it
had
no
more
to
do
with
his
reasoning
self
than
any
reflex
impulse
of
the
body
but
that
merely
lowered
anguish
to
disgust
yes
it
was
disgust
he
felt
almost
a
physical
nausea
the
poisonous
fumes
of
life
were
in
his
lungs
he
was
sick
unutterably
sick
he
drove
home
and
went
to
his
room
they
were
giving
a
little
dinner
that
night
and
when
he
came
down
the
guests
were
arriving
he
looked
at
his
wife
her
beauty
was
extraordinary
but
it
seemed
to
him
the
beauty
of
a
smooth
sea
along
an
unlit
coast
she
frightened
him
he
sat
late
that
night
in
his
study
he
heard
the
lock
the
front
door
then
his
wife
went
upstairs
and
the
lights
were
put
out
his
brain
was
like
some
great
empty
hall
with
an
echo
in
it
one
thought
reverberated
endlessly
at
length
he
drew
his
chair
to
the
table
and
began
to
write
he
addressed
an
envelope
and
then
slowly
what
he
had
written
my
dear
flamel
many
apologies
for
not
sending
you
sooner
the
enclosed
check
which
represents
the
customary
percentage
on
the
sale
of
the
trusting
you
will
excuse
the
oversight
yours
truly
stephen
he
let
himself
out
of
the
darkened
house
and
dropped
the
letter
in
the
at
the
corner
the
next
afternoon
he
was
detained
late
at
his
office
and
as
he
was
preparing
to
leave
he
heard
someone
asking
for
him
in
the
outer
room
he
seated
himself
again
and
flamel
was
shown
in
the
two
men
as
glennard
pushed
aside
an
obstructive
chair
had
a
moment
to
measure
each
other
then
flamel
advanced
and
drawing
out
his
laid
a
slip
of
paper
on
the
desk
my
dear
fellow
what
on
earth
does
this
mean
glennard
recognized
his
check
that
i
was
remiss
simply
it
ought
to
have
gone
to
you
flamel
s
tone
had
been
that
of
unaffected
surprise
but
at
this
his
accent
changed
and
he
asked
quickly
on
what
ground
glennard
had
moved
away
from
the
desk
and
stood
leaning
against
the
volumes
of
the
bookcase
on
the
ground
that
you
sold
aubyn
s
letters
for
me
and
that
i
find
the
intermediary
in
such
cases
is
entitled
to
a
percentage
on
the
flamel
paused
before
answering
you
find
you
say
it
s
a
recent
discovery
obviously
from
my
not
sending
the
check
sooner
you
see
i
m
new
to
the
and
since
when
have
you
discovered
that
there
was
any
question
of
business
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
glennard
flushed
and
his
voice
rose
slightly
are
you
reproaching
me
for
not
having
remembered
it
sooner
flamel
who
had
spoken
in
the
rapid
repressed
tone
of
a
man
on
the
verge
of
anger
stared
a
moment
at
this
and
then
in
his
natural
voice
rejoined
upon
my
soul
i
don
t
understand
you
the
change
of
key
seemed
to
disconcert
glennard
it
s
simple
enough
he
muttered
simple
enough
your
offering
me
money
in
return
for
a
friendly
service
i
don
t
know
what
your
other
friends
expect
some
of
my
friends
wouldn
t
have
undertaken
the
job
those
who
would
have
done
so
would
probably
have
expected
to
be
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
flamel
and
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
flamel
had
turned
white
and
his
lips
stirred
but
he
held
his
temperate
note
if
you
mean
to
imply
that
the
job
was
not
a
nice
one
you
lay
yourself
open
to
the
retort
that
you
proposed
it
but
for
my
part
i
ve
never
seen
i
never
shall
see
any
reason
for
not
publishing
the
that
s
just
it
what
the
certainty
of
your
not
seeing
was
what
made
me
go
to
you
when
a
man
s
got
stolen
goods
to
pawn
he
doesn
t
take
them
to
the
stolen
flamel
echoed
the
letters
were
stolen
glennard
burst
into
a
coarse
laugh
how
much
longer
do
you
expect
me
to
keep
up
that
pretence
about
the
letters
you
knew
well
enough
they
were
written
to
flamel
looked
at
him
in
silence
were
they
he
said
at
length
i
didn
t
know
and
didn
t
suspect
it
i
suppose
glennard
sneered
the
other
was
again
silent
then
he
said
i
may
remind
you
that
supposing
i
had
felt
any
curiosity
about
the
matter
i
had
no
way
of
finding
out
that
the
letters
were
written
to
you
you
never
showed
me
the
what
does
that
prove
there
were
fifty
ways
of
finding
out
it
s
the
kind
of
thing
one
can
easily
flamel
glanced
at
him
with
contempt
our
ideas
probably
differ
as
to
what
a
man
can
easily
do
it
would
not
have
been
easy
for
glennard
s
anger
vented
itself
in
the
words
uppermost
in
his
thought
it
may
then
interest
you
to
hear
that
my
wife
does
know
about
the
letters
has
known
for
some
months
ah
said
the
other
slowly
glennard
saw
that
in
his
blind
clutch
at
a
weapon
he
had
seized
the
one
most
apt
to
wound
flamel
s
muscles
were
under
control
but
his
face
showed
the
undefinable
change
produced
by
the
slow
infiltration
of
poison
every
implication
that
the
words
contained
had
reached
its
mark
but
glennard
felt
that
their
obvious
intention
was
lost
in
the
anguish
of
what
they
suggested
he
was
sure
now
that
flamel
would
never
have
betrayed
him
but
the
inference
only
made
a
wider
outlet
for
his
anger
he
paused
breathlessly
for
flamel
to
speak
if
she
knows
it
s
not
through
it
was
what
glennard
had
waited
for
through
you
by
god
who
said
it
was
through
you
do
you
suppose
i
leave
it
to
you
or
to
anybody
else
for
that
matter
to
keep
my
wife
informed
of
my
actions
i
didn
t
suppose
even
such
egregious
conceit
as
yours
could
delude
a
man
to
that
degree
struggling
for
a
foothold
in
the
small
landslide
of
his
dignity
he
added
in
a
steadier
tone
my
wife
learned
the
facts
from
flamel
received
this
in
silence
the
other
s
outbreak
seemed
to
have
reinforced
his
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
with
a
deliberation
implying
that
his
course
was
chosen
in
that
case
i
understand
still
less
still
less
the
meaning
of
he
pointed
to
the
check
when
you
began
to
speak
i
supposed
you
had
meant
it
as
a
bribe
now
i
can
only
infer
it
was
intended
as
a
random
insult
in
either
case
here
s
my
he
tore
the
slip
of
paper
in
two
and
tossed
the
fragments
across
the
desk
to
glennard
then
he
turned
and
walked
out
of
the
office
glennard
dropped
his
head
on
his
hands
if
he
had
hoped
to
restore
his
by
the
simple
expedient
of
assailing
flamel
s
the
result
had
not
justified
his
expectation
the
blow
he
had
struck
had
blunted
the
edge
of
his
anger
and
the
unforeseen
extent
of
the
hurt
inflicted
did
not
alter
the
fact
that
his
weapon
had
broken
in
his
hands
he
saw
now
that
his
rage
against
flamel
was
only
the
last
projection
of
a
passionate
this
consciousness
did
not
dull
his
dislike
of
the
man
it
simply
made
reprisals
ineffectual
flamel
s
unwillingness
to
quarrel
with
him
was
the
last
stage
of
his
abasement
in
the
light
of
this
final
humiliation
his
assumption
of
his
wife
s
indifference
struck
him
as
hardly
so
fatuous
as
the
sentimental
resuscitation
of
his
past
he
had
been
living
in
a
factitious
world
wherein
his
emotions
were
the
sycophants
of
his
vanity
and
it
was
with
instinctive
relief
that
he
felt
its
ruins
crash
about
his
head
it
was
nearly
dark
when
he
left
his
office
and
he
walked
slowly
homeward
in
the
complete
mental
abeyance
that
follows
on
such
a
crisis
he
was
not
aware
that
he
was
thinking
of
his
wife
yet
when
he
reached
his
own
door
he
found
that
in
the
involuntary
readjustment
of
his
vision
she
had
once
more
become
the
central
point
of
consciousness
xiii
it
had
never
before
occurred
to
him
that
she
might
after
all
have
missed
the
purport
of
the
document
he
had
put
in
her
way
what
if
in
her
hurried
inspection
of
the
papers
she
had
passed
it
over
as
related
to
the
private
business
of
some
client
what
for
instance
was
to
prevent
her
concluding
that
glennard
was
the
counsel
of
the
unknown
person
who
had
sold
the
aubyn
the
subject
was
one
not
likely
to
fix
her
attention
she
was
not
a
curious
woman
glennard
at
this
point
laid
down
his
fork
and
glanced
at
her
between
the
the
alternative
explanation
of
her
indifference
was
not
slow
in
presenting
itself
her
head
had
the
same
listening
droop
as
when
he
had
caught
sight
of
her
the
day
before
in
flamel
s
company
the
attitude
revived
the
vividness
of
his
impression
it
was
simple
enough
after
all
she
had
ceased
to
care
for
him
because
she
cared
for
someone
else
as
he
followed
her
upstairs
he
felt
a
sudden
stirring
of
his
dormant
anger
his
sentiments
had
lost
all
their
factitious
complexity
he
had
already
acquitted
her
of
any
connivance
in
his
baseness
and
he
felt
only
that
he
loved
her
and
that
she
had
escaped
him
this
was
now
strangely
enough
his
dominating
thought
the
consciousness
that
he
and
she
had
passed
through
the
fusion
of
love
and
had
emerged
from
it
as
incommunicably
apart
as
though
the
transmutation
had
never
taken
place
every
other
passion
he
mused
left
some
mark
upon
the
nature
but
love
passed
like
the
flight
of
a
ship
across
the
waters
she
sank
into
her
usual
seat
near
the
lamp
and
he
leaned
against
the
chimney
moving
about
with
an
inattentive
hand
the
on
the
mantel
suddenly
he
caught
sight
of
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
she
was
looking
at
him
he
turned
and
their
eyes
met
he
moved
across
the
room
and
stood
before
her
there
s
something
that
i
want
to
say
to
you
he
began
in
a
low
tone
she
held
his
gaze
but
her
color
deepened
he
noticed
again
with
a
jealous
pang
how
her
beauty
had
gained
in
warmth
and
meaning
it
was
as
though
a
transparent
cup
had
been
filled
with
wine
he
looked
at
her
ironically
i
ve
never
prevented
your
seeing
your
friends
here
he
broke
out
why
do
you
meet
flamel
in
places
nothing
makes
a
woman
so
cheap
she
rose
abruptly
and
they
faced
each
other
a
few
feet
apart
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
i
saw
you
with
him
last
sunday
on
the
riverside
drive
he
went
on
the
utterance
of
the
charge
reviving
his
anger
ah
she
murmured
she
sank
into
her
chair
again
and
began
to
play
with
a
that
lay
on
the
table
at
her
elbow
her
silence
exasperated
him
well
he
burst
out
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
do
you
wish
me
to
explain
she
asked
proudly
do
you
imply
i
haven
t
the
right
to
i
imply
nothing
i
will
tell
you
whatever
you
wish
to
know
i
went
for
a
walk
with
flamel
because
he
asked
me
i
didn
t
suppose
you
went
uninvited
but
there
are
certain
things
a
sensible
woman
doesn
t
do
she
doesn
t
slink
about
in
streets
with
men
why
couldn
t
you
have
seen
him
here
she
hesitated
because
he
wanted
to
see
me
did
he
indeed
and
may
i
ask
if
you
gratify
all
his
wishes
with
equal
alacrity
i
don
t
know
that
he
has
any
others
where
i
am
she
paused
again
and
then
continued
in
a
lower
voice
that
somehow
had
an
of
warning
he
wished
to
bid
me
he
s
going
glennard
turned
on
her
a
startled
glance
going
away
he
s
going
to
europe
he
goes
for
a
long
time
i
supposed
you
the
last
phrase
revived
his
irritation
you
forget
that
i
depend
on
you
for
my
information
about
flamel
he
s
your
friend
and
not
mine
in
fact
i
ve
sometimes
wondered
at
your
going
out
of
your
way
to
be
so
civil
to
him
when
you
must
see
plainly
enough
that
i
don
t
like
her
answer
to
this
was
not
immediate
she
seemed
to
be
choosing
her
words
with
care
not
so
much
for
her
own
sake
as
for
his
and
his
exasperation
was
increased
by
the
suspicion
that
she
was
trying
to
spare
him
he
was
your
friend
before
he
was
mine
i
never
knew
him
till
i
was
married
it
was
you
who
brought
him
to
the
house
and
who
seemed
to
wish
me
to
like
glennard
gave
a
short
laugh
the
defence
was
feebler
than
he
had
expected
she
was
certainly
not
a
clever
woman
your
deference
to
my
wishes
is
really
beautiful
but
it
s
not
the
first
time
in
history
that
a
man
has
made
a
mistake
in
introducing
his
friends
to
his
wife
you
must
at
any
rate
have
seen
since
then
that
my
enthusiasm
had
cooled
but
so
perhaps
has
your
eagerness
to
oblige
she
met
this
with
a
silence
that
seemed
to
rob
the
taunt
of
half
its
efficacy
is
that
what
you
imply
he
pressed
her
no
she
answered
with
sudden
directness
i
noticed
some
time
ago
that
you
seemed
to
dislike
him
but
since
then
well
since
then
i
ve
imagined
that
you
had
reasons
for
still
wishing
me
to
be
civil
to
him
as
you
call
ah
said
glennard
with
an
effort
at
lightness
but
his
irony
dropped
for
something
in
her
voice
made
him
feel
that
he
and
she
stood
at
last
in
that
naked
desert
of
apprehension
where
meaning
skulks
vainly
behind
speech
and
why
did
you
imagine
this
the
blood
mounted
to
his
forehead
because
he
told
you
that
i
was
under
obligations
to
him
she
turned
pale
under
obligations
oh
don
t
let
s
beat
about
the
bush
didn
t
he
tell
you
it
was
i
who
published
aubyn
s
letters
answer
me
no
she
said
and
after
a
moment
which
seemed
given
to
the
weighing
of
alternatives
she
added
no
one
told
you
didn
t
know
then
she
seemed
to
speak
with
an
effort
not
until
not
until
till
i
gave
you
those
papers
to
sort
her
head
sank
you
understood
then
he
looked
at
her
immovable
face
had
you
suspected
before
was
slowly
wrung
from
him
at
times
yes
her
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
why
from
anything
that
was
said
there
was
a
shade
of
pity
in
her
glance
no
one
said
anything
no
one
told
me
she
looked
away
from
him
it
was
your
manner
my
manner
whenever
the
book
was
mentioned
things
you
said
once
or
twice
your
irritation
i
can
t
explain
glennard
unconsciously
had
moved
nearer
he
breathed
like
a
man
who
has
been
running
you
knew
then
you
knew
he
stammered
the
avowal
of
her
love
for
flamel
would
have
hurt
him
less
would
have
rendered
her
less
remote
you
knew
you
knew
he
repeated
and
suddenly
his
anguish
gathered
voice
my
god
he
cried
you
suspected
it
first
you
say
and
then
you
knew
it
this
damnable
this
accursed
thing
you
knew
it
months
ago
it
s
months
since
i
put
that
paper
in
your
way
and
yet
you
ve
done
nothing
you
ve
said
nothing
you
ve
made
no
sign
you
ve
lived
alongside
of
me
as
if
it
had
made
no
difference
no
difference
in
either
of
our
lives
what
are
you
made
of
i
wonder
don
t
you
see
the
hideous
ignominy
of
it
don
t
you
see
how
you
ve
shared
in
my
disgrace
or
haven
t
you
any
sense
of
shame
he
preserved
sufficient
lucidity
as
the
words
poured
from
him
to
see
how
fatally
they
invited
her
derision
but
something
told
him
they
had
both
passed
beyond
the
phase
of
obvious
retaliations
and
that
if
any
chord
in
her
responded
it
would
not
be
that
of
scorn
he
was
right
she
rose
slowly
and
moved
toward
him
haven
t
you
had
enough
without
that
she
said
in
a
strange
voice
of
pity
he
stared
at
her
enough
of
misery
an
iron
band
seemed
loosened
from
his
temples
you
saw
then
he
whispered
oh
god
oh
god
she
sobbed
she
dropped
beside
him
and
hid
her
anguish
against
his
knees
they
clung
thus
in
silence
a
long
time
driven
together
down
the
same
fierce
blast
of
shame
when
at
length
she
lifted
her
face
he
averted
his
her
scorn
would
have
hurt
him
less
than
the
tears
on
his
hands
she
spoke
languidly
like
a
child
emerging
from
a
passion
of
weeping
it
was
for
the
money
his
lips
shaped
an
assent
that
was
the
inheritance
that
we
married
on
she
drew
back
and
rose
to
her
feet
he
sat
watching
her
as
she
wandered
away
from
him
you
hate
me
broke
from
him
she
made
no
answer
say
you
hate
me
he
persisted
that
would
have
been
so
simple
she
answered
with
a
strange
smile
she
dropped
into
a
chair
near
the
and
rested
a
bowed
forehead
on
her
hand
was
it
much
she
began
at
length
much
he
returned
vaguely
the
the
money
that
part
of
it
seemed
to
count
so
little
that
for
a
moment
he
did
not
follow
her
thought
it
must
be
paid
back
she
insisted
can
you
do
it
oh
yes
he
returned
listlessly
i
can
do
i
would
make
any
sacrifice
for
that
she
urged
he
nodded
of
he
sat
staring
at
her
in
do
you
count
on
its
making
much
difference
much
difference
in
the
way
i
feel
or
you
feel
about
me
she
shook
her
head
it
s
the
least
part
of
it
he
groaned
it
s
the
only
part
we
can
good
heavens
if
there
were
any
reparation
he
rose
quickly
and
crossed
the
space
that
divided
them
why
did
you
never
speak
he
asked
haven
t
you
answered
that
yourself
answered
it
just
now
when
you
told
me
you
did
it
for
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
went
on
with
a
deepening
note
i
would
have
spoken
if
i
could
have
helped
but
you
must
have
despised
i
ve
told
you
that
would
have
been
but
how
could
you
go
on
like
this
hating
the
money
i
knew
you
would
speak
in
time
i
wanted
you
first
to
hate
it
as
i
he
gazed
at
her
with
a
kind
of
awe
you
re
wonderful
he
murmured
but
you
don
t
yet
know
the
depths
i
ve
she
raised
an
entreating
hand
i
don
t
want
to
you
re
afraid
then
that
you
ll
hate
me
no
but
that
you
ll
hate
me
let
me
understand
without
your
telling
you
can
t
it
s
too
base
i
thought
you
didn
t
care
because
you
loved
she
blushed
deeply
don
t
don
t
she
warned
him
i
haven
t
the
right
to
you
mean
i
mean
that
you
ll
be
he
stood
imploringly
before
her
i
want
to
say
something
worse
something
more
outrageous
if
you
don
t
understand
this
you
ll
be
perfectly
justified
in
ordering
me
out
of
the
she
answered
him
with
a
glance
of
divination
i
shall
understand
but
you
ll
be
i
must
take
my
chance
of
he
moved
away
and
tossed
the
books
about
the
table
then
he
swung
round
and
faced
her
does
flamel
care
for
you
he
asked
her
flush
deepened
but
she
still
looked
at
him
without
anger
what
would
be
the
use
she
said
with
a
note
of
sadness
ah
i
didn
t
ask
that
he
penitently
murmured
well
then
to
this
adjuration
he
made
no
response
beyond
that
of
gazing
at
her
with
an
eye
which
seemed
now
to
view
her
as
a
mere
factor
in
an
immense
redistribution
of
meanings
i
insulted
flamel
i
let
him
see
that
i
suspected
him
of
having
told
you
i
hated
him
because
he
knew
about
the
he
caught
the
spreading
horror
of
her
eyes
and
for
an
instant
he
had
to
grapple
with
the
new
temptation
they
lit
up
then
he
said
with
an
effort
don
t
blame
him
he
s
impeccable
he
helped
me
to
get
them
published
but
i
lied
to
him
too
i
pretended
they
were
written
to
another
man
a
man
who
was
dead
she
raised
her
arms
in
a
gesture
that
seemed
to
ward
off
his
blows
you
do
despise
me
he
insisted
ah
that
poor
woman
that
poor
woman
he
heard
her
murmur
i
spare
no
one
you
see
he
triumphed
over
her
she
kept
her
face
hidden
you
do
hate
me
you
do
despise
me
he
strangely
exulted
be
silent
she
commanded
him
but
he
seemed
no
longer
conscious
of
any
check
on
his
gathering
purpose
he
cared
for
you
he
cared
for
you
he
repeated
and
he
never
told
you
of
the
letters
she
sprang
to
her
feet
how
can
you
she
flamed
how
dare
you
that
glennard
was
ashy
pale
it
s
a
weapon
like
another
a
scoundrel
s
he
smiled
wretchedly
i
should
have
used
it
in
his
stephen
stephen
she
cried
as
though
to
drown
the
blasphemy
on
his
lips
she
swept
to
him
with
a
rescuing
gesture
don
t
say
such
things
i
forbid
you
it
degrades
us
he
put
her
back
with
trembling
hands
nothing
that
i
say
of
myself
can
degrade
you
we
re
on
different
i
m
on
yours
whatever
it
is
he
lifted
his
head
and
their
gaze
flowed
together
xiv
the
great
renewals
take
effect
as
imperceptibly
as
the
first
workings
of
spring
glennard
though
he
felt
himself
brought
nearer
to
his
wife
was
still
as
it
were
hardly
within
speaking
distance
he
was
but
laboriously
acquiring
the
rudiments
of
their
new
medium
of
communication
and
he
had
to
grope
for
her
through
the
dense
fog
of
his
humiliation
the
distorting
vapor
against
which
his
personality
loomed
grotesque
and
mean
only
the
fact
that
we
are
unaware
how
well
our
nearest
know
us
enables
us
to
live
with
them
love
is
the
most
impregnable
refuge
of
and
we
hate
the
eye
that
reaches
to
our
nakedness
if
glennard
did
not
hate
his
wife
it
was
slowly
sufferingly
that
there
was
born
in
him
that
profounder
passion
which
made
his
earlier
feeling
seem
a
mere
commotion
of
the
blood
he
was
like
a
child
coming
back
to
the
sense
of
an
enveloping
presence
her
nearness
was
a
breast
on
which
he
leaned
they
did
not
at
first
talk
much
together
and
each
beat
a
devious
track
about
the
outskirts
of
the
subject
that
lay
between
them
like
a
haunted
wood
but
every
word
every
action
seemed
to
glance
at
it
to
draw
toward
it
as
though
a
fount
of
healing
sprang
in
its
poisoned
shade
if
only
they
might
cut
away
through
the
thicket
to
that
restoring
spring
glennard
watching
his
wife
with
the
intentness
of
a
wanderer
to
whom
no
natural
sign
is
negligible
saw
that
she
had
taken
temporary
refuge
in
the
purpose
of
renouncing
the
money
if
both
theoretically
owned
the
inefficacy
of
such
amends
the
woman
s
instinctive
subjectiveness
made
her
find
relief
in
this
crude
form
of
penance
glennard
saw
that
she
meant
to
live
as
frugally
as
possible
till
what
she
deemed
their
debt
was
discharged
and
he
prayed
she
might
not
discover
how
in
its
merely
material
sense
was
the
obligation
she
thus
hoped
to
acquit
her
mind
was
fixed
on
the
sum
originally
paid
for
the
letters
and
this
he
knew
he
could
lay
aside
in
a
year
or
two
he
was
touched
meanwhile
by
the
spirit
that
made
her
discard
the
petty
luxuries
which
she
regarded
as
the
signs
of
their
bondage
their
shared
renunciations
drew
her
nearer
to
him
helped
in
their
evidence
of
her
helplessness
to
restore
the
full
protecting
stature
of
his
love
and
still
they
did
not
speak
it
was
several
weeks
later
that
one
afternoon
by
the
fire
she
handed
him
a
letter
that
she
had
been
reading
when
he
entered
i
ve
heard
from
flamel
she
said
glennard
turned
pale
it
was
as
though
a
latent
presence
had
suddenly
become
visible
to
both
he
took
the
letter
mechanically
it
s
from
smyrna
she
said
won
t
you
read
it
he
handed
it
back
you
can
tell
me
about
it
his
hand
s
so
he
wandered
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
then
turned
and
stood
before
her
i
ve
been
thinking
of
writing
to
flamel
he
said
she
looked
up
there
s
one
point
he
continued
slowly
that
i
ought
to
clear
up
i
told
him
you
d
known
about
the
letters
all
along
for
a
long
time
at
least
and
i
saw
it
hurt
him
horribly
it
was
just
what
i
meant
to
do
of
course
but
i
can
t
leave
him
to
that
false
impression
i
must
write
she
received
this
without
outward
movement
but
he
saw
that
the
depths
were
stirred
at
length
she
returned
in
a
hesitating
tone
why
do
you
call
it
a
false
impression
i
did
yes
but
i
implied
you
didn
t
ah
he
still
stood
looking
down
on
her
don
t
you
want
me
to
set
that
right
he
tentatively
pursued
she
lifted
her
head
and
fixed
him
bravely
it
isn
t
necessary
she
said
glennard
flushed
with
the
shock
of
the
retort
then
with
a
gesture
of
comprehension
no
he
said
with
you
it
couldn
t
be
but
i
might
still
set
myself
she
looked
at
him
gently
don
t
i
she
murmured
do
that
in
being
yourself
merely
alas
the
rehabilitation
s
too
complete
you
make
me
seem
to
myself
even
what
i
m
not
what
i
can
never
be
i
can
t
at
times
defend
myself
from
the
delusion
but
i
can
at
least
enlighten
the
flood
was
loosened
and
kneeling
by
her
he
caught
her
hands
don
t
you
see
that
it
s
become
an
obsession
with
me
that
if
i
could
strip
myself
down
to
the
last
lie
only
there
d
always
be
another
one
left
under
it
and
do
penance
naked
in
the
i
should
at
least
have
the
relief
of
easing
one
anguish
by
another
don
t
you
see
that
the
worst
of
my
torture
is
the
impossibility
of
such
amends
her
hands
lay
in
his
without
returning
pressure
ah
poor
woman
poor
woman
he
heard
her
sigh
don
t
pity
her
pity
me
what
have
i
done
to
her
or
to
you
after
all
you
re
both
inaccessible
it
was
myself
i
he
took
an
abrupt
turn
away
from
her
then
halted
before
her
again
how
much
longer
he
burst
out
do
you
suppose
you
can
stand
it
you
ve
been
magnificent
you
ve
been
inspired
but
what
s
the
use
you
can
t
wipe
out
the
ignominy
of
it
it
s
miserable
for
you
and
it
does
her
no
good
she
lifted
a
vivid
face
that
s
the
thought
i
can
t
bear
she
cried
what
thought
that
it
does
her
no
good
all
you
re
feeling
all
you
re
suffering
can
it
be
that
it
makes
no
difference
he
avoided
her
challenging
glance
what
s
done
is
done
he
muttered
is
it
ever
quite
i
wonder
she
mused
he
made
no
answer
and
they
lapsed
into
one
of
the
pauses
that
are
a
subterranean
channel
of
communication
it
was
she
who
after
awhile
began
to
speak
with
a
new
suffusing
diffidence
that
made
him
turn
a
roused
eye
on
her
don
t
they
say
she
asked
feeling
her
way
as
in
a
kind
of
tender
apprehensiveness
that
the
early
christians
instead
of
pulling
down
the
heathen
temples
the
temples
of
the
unclean
gods
purified
them
by
turning
them
to
their
own
uses
i
ve
always
thought
one
might
do
that
with
one
s
actions
the
actions
one
loathes
but
can
t
undo
one
can
make
i
mean
a
wrong
the
door
to
other
wrongs
or
an
impassable
wall
against
them
her
voice
wavered
on
the
word
we
can
t
always
tear
down
the
temples
we
ve
built
to
the
unclean
gods
but
we
can
put
good
spirits
in
the
house
of
evil
the
spirits
of
mercy
and
shame
and
understanding
that
might
never
have
come
to
us
if
we
hadn
t
been
in
such
great
need
she
moved
over
to
him
and
laid
a
hesitating
hand
on
his
his
head
was
bent
and
he
did
not
change
his
attitude
she
sat
down
beside
him
without
speaking
but
their
silences
now
were
fertile
as
they
quickened
the
seeds
of
understanding
at
length
he
looked
up
i
don
t
know
he
said
what
spirits
have
come
to
live
in
the
house
of
evil
that
i
built
but
you
re
there
and
that
s
enough
for
me
it
s
strange
he
went
on
after
another
pause
she
wished
the
best
for
me
so
often
and
now
at
last
it
s
through
her
that
it
s
come
to
me
but
for
her
i
shouldn
t
have
known
you
it
s
through
her
that
i
ve
found
you
sometimes
do
you
know
that
makes
it
hardest
makes
me
most
intolerable
to
myself
can
t
you
see
that
it
s
the
worst
thing
i
ve
got
to
face
i
sometimes
think
i
could
have
borne
it
better
if
you
hadn
t
understood
i
took
everything
from
her
everything
even
to
the
poor
shelter
of
loyalty
she
d
trusted
in
the
only
thing
i
could
have
left
her
i
took
everything
from
