the
floressas
des
esseintes
to
judge
by
the
various
portraits
preserved
in
the
chateau
de
lourps
had
originally
been
a
family
of
stalwart
troopers
and
stern
cavalry
men
closely
arrayed
side
by
side
in
the
old
frames
which
their
broad
shoulders
filled
they
startled
one
with
the
fixed
gaze
of
their
eyes
their
fierce
moustaches
and
the
chests
whose
deep
curves
filled
the
enormous
shells
of
their
cuirasses
these
were
the
ancestors
there
were
no
portraits
of
their
descendants
and
a
wide
breach
existed
in
the
series
of
the
faces
of
this
race
only
one
painting
served
as
a
link
to
connect
the
past
and
present
a
crafty
mysterious
head
with
haggard
and
gaunt
features
cheekbones
punctuated
with
a
comma
of
paint
the
hair
overspread
with
pearls
a
painted
neck
rising
stiffly
from
the
fluted
ruff
in
this
representation
of
one
of
the
most
intimate
friends
of
the
duc
and
the
marquis
the
ravages
of
a
sluggish
and
impoverished
constitution
were
already
noticeable
it
was
obvious
that
the
decadence
of
this
family
had
followed
an
unvarying
course
the
effemination
of
the
males
had
continued
with
quickened
tempo
as
if
to
conclude
the
work
of
long
years
the
des
esseintes
had
intermarried
for
two
centuries
using
up
in
such
consanguineous
unions
such
strength
as
remained
there
was
only
one
living
scion
of
this
family
which
had
once
been
so
numerous
that
it
had
occupied
all
the
territories
of
the
and
la
brie
the
duc
jean
was
a
slender
nervous
young
man
of
thirty
with
hollow
cheeks
cold
eyes
a
straight
thin
nose
and
delicate
hands
by
a
singular
atavistic
reversion
the
last
descendant
resembled
the
old
grandsire
from
whom
he
had
inherited
the
pointed
remarkably
fair
beard
and
an
ambiguous
expression
at
once
weary
and
cunning
his
childhood
had
been
an
unhappy
one
menaced
with
scrofula
and
afflicted
with
relentless
fevers
he
yet
succeeded
in
crossing
the
breakers
of
adolescence
thanks
to
fresh
air
and
careful
attention
he
grew
stronger
overcame
the
languors
of
chlorosis
and
reached
his
full
development
his
mother
a
tall
pale
taciturn
woman
died
of
anaemia
and
his
father
of
some
uncertain
malady
des
esseintes
was
then
seventeen
years
of
age
he
retained
but
a
vague
memory
of
his
parents
and
felt
neither
affection
nor
gratitude
for
them
he
hardly
knew
his
father
who
usually
resided
in
paris
he
recalled
his
mother
as
she
lay
motionless
in
a
dim
room
of
the
chateau
de
lourps
the
husband
and
wife
would
meet
on
rare
occasions
and
he
remembered
those
lifeless
interviews
when
his
parents
sat
face
to
face
in
front
of
a
round
table
faintly
lit
by
a
lamp
with
a
wide
shade
for
the
could
not
endure
light
or
sound
without
being
seized
with
a
fit
of
nervousness
a
few
halting
words
would
be
exchanged
between
them
in
the
gloom
and
then
the
indifferent
would
depart
to
meet
the
first
train
back
to
paris
jean
life
at
the
jesuit
school
where
he
was
sent
to
study
was
more
pleasant
at
first
the
fathers
pampered
the
lad
whose
intelligence
astonished
them
but
despite
their
efforts
they
could
not
induce
him
to
concentrate
on
studies
requiring
discipline
he
nibbled
at
various
books
and
was
precociously
brilliant
in
latin
on
the
contrary
he
was
absolutely
incapable
of
construing
two
greek
words
showed
no
aptitude
for
living
languages
and
promptly
proved
himself
a
dunce
when
obliged
to
master
the
elements
of
the
sciences
his
family
gave
him
little
heed
sometimes
his
father
visited
him
at
school
how
are
you
be
good
study
hard
and
he
was
gone
the
lad
passed
the
summer
vacations
at
the
chateau
de
lourps
but
his
presence
could
not
seduce
his
mother
from
her
reveries
she
scarcely
noticed
him
when
she
did
her
gaze
would
rest
on
him
for
a
moment
with
a
sad
smile
and
that
was
all
the
moment
after
she
would
again
become
absorbed
in
the
artificial
night
with
which
the
heavily
curtained
windows
enshrouded
the
room
the
servants
were
old
and
dull
left
to
himself
the
boy
delved
into
books
on
rainy
days
and
roamed
about
the
countryside
on
pleasant
afternoons
it
was
his
supreme
delight
to
wander
down
the
little
valley
to
jutigny
a
village
planted
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
a
tiny
heap
of
cottages
capped
with
thatch
strewn
with
tufts
of
sengreen
and
clumps
of
moss
in
the
open
fields
under
the
shadow
of
high
ricks
he
would
lie
listening
to
the
hollow
splashing
of
the
mills
and
inhaling
the
fresh
breeze
from
voulzie
sometimes
he
went
as
far
as
the
to
the
green
and
black
hamlet
of
longueville
or
climbed
hillsides
affording
magnificent
views
there
below
to
one
side
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
lay
the
seine
valley
blending
in
the
distance
with
the
blue
sky
high
up
near
the
horizon
on
the
other
side
rose
the
churches
and
tower
of
provins
which
seemed
to
tremble
in
the
golden
dust
of
the
air
immersed
in
solitude
he
would
dream
or
read
far
into
the
night
by
protracted
contemplation
of
the
same
thoughts
his
mind
grew
sharp
his
vague
undeveloped
ideas
took
on
form
after
each
vacation
jean
returned
to
his
masters
more
reflective
and
headstrong
these
changes
did
not
escape
them
subtle
and
observant
accustomed
by
their
profession
to
plumb
souls
to
their
depths
they
were
fully
aware
of
his
unresponsiveness
to
their
teachings
they
knew
that
this
student
would
never
contribute
to
the
glory
of
their
order
and
as
his
family
was
rich
and
apparently
careless
of
his
future
they
soon
renounced
the
idea
of
having
him
take
up
any
of
the
professions
their
school
offered
although
he
willingly
discussed
with
them
those
theological
doctrines
which
intrigued
his
fancy
by
their
subtleties
and
they
did
not
even
think
of
training
him
for
the
religious
orders
since
in
spite
of
their
efforts
his
faith
remained
languid
as
a
last
resort
through
prudence
and
fear
of
the
harm
he
might
effect
they
permitted
him
to
pursue
whatever
studies
pleased
him
and
to
neglect
the
others
being
loath
to
antagonize
this
bold
and
independent
spirit
by
the
quibblings
of
the
lay
school
assistants
thus
he
lived
in
perfect
contentment
scarcely
feeling
the
parental
yoke
of
the
priests
he
continued
his
latin
and
french
studies
when
the
whim
seized
him
and
although
theology
did
not
figure
in
his
schedule
he
finished
his
apprenticeship
in
this
science
begun
at
the
chateau
de
lourps
in
the
library
bequeathed
by
his
dom
prosper
the
old
prior
of
the
regular
canons
of
but
soon
the
time
came
when
he
must
quit
the
jesuit
institution
he
attained
his
majority
and
became
master
of
his
fortune
the
comte
de
montchevrel
his
cousin
and
guardian
placed
in
his
hands
the
title
to
his
wealth
there
was
no
intimacy
between
them
for
there
was
no
possible
point
of
contact
between
these
two
men
the
one
young
the
other
old
impelled
by
curiosity
idleness
or
politeness
des
esseintes
sometimes
visited
the
montchevrel
family
and
spent
some
dull
evenings
in
their
rue
de
la
chaise
mansion
where
the
ladies
old
as
antiquity
itself
would
gossip
of
quarterings
of
the
noble
arms
heraldic
moons
and
anachronistic
ceremonies
the
men
gathered
around
whist
tables
proved
even
more
shallow
and
insignificant
than
the
dowagers
these
descendants
of
ancient
courageous
knights
these
last
branches
of
feudal
races
appeared
to
des
esseintes
as
catarrhal
crazy
old
men
repeating
inanities
and
phrases
a
de
seemed
the
sole
imprint
on
the
soft
pap
of
their
brains
the
youth
felt
an
unutterable
pity
for
these
mummies
buried
in
their
elaborate
hypogeums
of
wainscoting
and
grotto
work
for
these
tedious
triflers
whose
eyes
were
forever
turned
towards
a
hazy
canaan
an
imaginary
palestine
after
a
few
visits
with
such
relatives
he
resolved
never
again
to
set
foot
in
their
homes
regardless
of
invitations
or
reproaches
then
he
began
to
seek
out
the
young
men
of
his
own
age
and
set
one
group
educated
like
himself
in
religious
institutions
preserved
the
special
marks
of
this
training
they
attended
religious
services
received
the
sacrament
on
easter
frequented
the
catholic
circles
and
concealed
as
criminal
their
amorous
escapades
for
the
most
part
they
were
unintelligent
acquiescent
fops
stupid
bores
who
had
tried
the
patience
of
their
professors
yet
these
professors
were
pleased
to
have
bestowed
such
docile
pious
creatures
upon
society
the
other
group
educated
in
the
state
colleges
or
in
the
were
less
hypocritical
and
much
more
courageous
but
they
were
neither
more
interesting
nor
less
bigoted
gay
young
men
dazzled
by
operettas
and
races
they
played
lansquenet
and
baccarat
staked
large
fortunes
on
horses
and
cards
and
cultivated
all
the
pleasures
enchanting
to
brainless
fools
after
a
year
experience
des
esseintes
felt
an
overpowering
weariness
of
this
company
whose
debaucheries
seemed
to
him
so
unrefined
facile
and
indiscriminate
without
any
ardent
reactions
or
excitement
of
nerves
and
blood
he
gradually
forsook
them
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
literary
men
in
whom
he
thought
he
might
find
more
interest
and
feel
more
at
ease
this
too
proved
disappointing
he
was
revolted
by
their
rancorous
and
petty
judgments
their
conversation
as
obvious
as
a
church
door
their
dreary
discussions
in
which
they
judged
the
value
of
a
book
by
the
number
of
editions
it
had
passed
and
by
the
profits
acquired
at
the
same
time
he
noticed
that
the
free
thinkers
the
doctrinaires
of
the
bourgeoisie
people
who
claimed
every
liberty
that
they
might
stifle
the
opinions
of
others
were
greedy
and
shameless
puritans
whom
in
education
he
esteemed
inferior
to
the
corner
shoemaker
his
contempt
for
humanity
deepened
he
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
world
for
the
most
part
was
composed
of
scoundrels
and
imbeciles
certainly
he
could
not
hope
to
discover
in
others
aspirations
and
aversions
similar
to
his
own
could
not
expect
companionship
with
an
intelligence
exulting
in
a
studious
decrepitude
nor
anticipate
meeting
a
mind
as
keen
as
his
among
the
writers
and
scholars
irritated
ill
at
ease
and
offended
by
the
poverty
of
ideas
given
and
received
he
became
like
those
people
described
by
nicole
those
who
are
always
melancholy
he
would
fly
into
a
rage
when
he
read
the
patriotic
and
social
balderdash
retailed
daily
in
the
newspapers
and
would
exaggerate
the
significance
of
the
plaudits
which
a
sovereign
public
always
reserves
for
works
deficient
in
ideas
and
style
already
he
was
dreaming
of
a
refined
solitude
a
comfortable
desert
a
motionless
ark
in
which
to
seek
refuge
from
the
unending
deluge
of
human
stupidity
a
single
passion
woman
might
have
curbed
his
contempt
but
that
too
had
palled
on
him
he
had
taken
to
carnal
repasts
with
the
eagerness
of
a
crotchety
man
affected
with
a
depraved
appetite
and
given
to
sudden
hungers
whose
taste
is
quickly
dulled
and
surfeited
associating
with
country
squires
he
had
taken
part
in
their
lavish
suppers
where
at
dessert
tipsy
women
would
unfasten
their
clothing
and
strike
their
heads
against
the
tables
he
had
haunted
the
green
rooms
loved
actresses
and
singers
endured
in
addition
to
the
natural
stupidity
he
had
come
to
expect
of
women
the
maddening
vanity
of
female
strolling
players
finally
satiated
and
weary
of
this
monotonous
extravagance
and
the
sameness
of
their
caresses
he
had
plunged
into
the
foul
depths
hoping
by
the
contrast
of
squalid
misery
to
revive
his
desires
and
stimulate
his
deadened
senses
whatever
he
attempted
proved
vain
an
unconquerable
ennui
oppressed
him
yet
he
persisted
in
his
excesses
and
returned
to
the
perilous
embraces
of
accomplished
mistresses
but
his
health
failed
his
nervous
system
collapsed
the
back
of
his
neck
grew
sensitive
his
hand
still
firm
when
it
seized
a
heavy
object
trembled
when
it
held
a
tiny
glass
the
physicians
whom
he
consulted
frightened
him
it
was
high
time
to
check
his
excesses
and
renounce
those
pursuits
which
were
dissipating
his
reserve
of
strength
for
a
while
he
was
at
peace
but
his
brain
soon
became
like
those
young
girls
who
in
the
grip
of
puberty
crave
coarse
and
vile
foods
he
dreamed
of
and
practiced
perverse
loves
and
pleasures
this
was
the
end
as
though
satisfied
with
having
exhausted
everything
as
though
completely
surrendering
to
fatigue
his
senses
fell
into
a
lethargy
and
impotence
threatened
him
he
recovered
but
he
was
lonely
tired
sobered
imploring
an
end
to
his
life
which
the
cowardice
of
his
flesh
prevented
him
from
consummating
once
more
he
was
toying
with
the
idea
of
becoming
a
recluse
of
living
in
some
hushed
retreat
where
the
turmoil
of
life
would
be
muffled
as
in
those
streets
covered
with
straw
to
prevent
any
sound
from
reaching
invalids
it
was
time
to
make
up
his
mind
the
condition
of
his
finances
terrified
him
he
had
spent
in
acts
of
folly
and
in
drinking
bouts
the
greater
part
of
his
patrimony
and
the
remainder
invested
in
land
produced
a
ridiculously
small
income
he
decided
to
sell
the
chateau
de
lourps
which
he
no
longer
visited
and
where
he
left
no
memory
or
regret
behind
he
liquidated
his
other
holdings
bought
government
bonds
and
in
this
way
drew
an
annual
interest
of
fifty
thousand
francs
in
addition
he
reserved
a
sum
of
money
which
he
meant
to
use
in
buying
and
furnishing
the
house
where
he
proposed
to
enjoy
a
perfect
repose
exploring
the
suburbs
of
the
capital
he
found
a
place
for
sale
at
the
top
of
in
a
secluded
section
near
the
fort
far
from
any
neighbors
his
dream
was
realized
in
this
country
place
so
little
violated
by
parisians
he
could
be
certain
of
seclusion
the
difficulty
of
reaching
the
place
due
to
an
unreliable
railroad
passing
by
at
the
end
of
the
town
and
to
the
little
street
cars
which
came
and
went
at
irregular
intervals
reassured
him
he
could
picture
himself
alone
on
the
bluff
sufficiently
far
away
to
prevent
the
parisian
throngs
from
reaching
him
and
yet
near
enough
to
the
capital
to
confirm
him
in
his
solitude
and
he
felt
that
in
not
entirely
closing
the
way
there
was
a
chance
that
he
would
not
be
assailed
by
a
wish
to
return
to
society
seeing
that
it
is
only
the
impossible
the
unachievable
that
arouses
desire
he
put
masons
to
work
on
the
house
he
had
acquired
then
one
day
informing
no
one
of
his
plans
he
quickly
disposed
of
his
old
furniture
dismissed
his
servants
and
left
without
giving
the
concierge
any
address
chapter
more
than
two
months
passed
before
des
esseintes
could
bury
himself
in
the
silent
repose
of
his
fontenay
abode
he
was
obliged
to
go
to
paris
again
to
comb
the
city
in
his
search
for
the
things
he
wanted
to
buy
what
care
he
took
what
meditations
he
surrendered
himself
to
before
turning
over
his
house
to
the
upholsterers
he
had
long
been
a
connoisseur
in
the
sincerities
and
evasions
of
in
the
days
when
he
had
entertained
women
at
his
home
he
had
created
a
boudoir
where
amid
daintily
carved
furniture
of
pale
japanese
under
a
sort
of
pavillion
of
indian
satin
the
flesh
would
color
delicately
in
the
borrowed
lights
of
the
silken
hangings
this
room
each
of
whose
sides
was
lined
with
mirrors
that
echoed
each
other
all
along
the
walls
reflecting
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
whole
series
of
rose
boudoirs
had
been
celebrated
among
the
women
who
loved
to
immerse
their
nudity
in
this
bath
of
warm
carnation
made
fragrant
with
the
odor
of
mint
emanating
from
the
exotic
wood
of
the
furniture
aside
from
the
sensual
delights
for
which
he
had
designed
this
chamber
this
painted
atmosphere
which
gave
new
color
to
faces
grown
dull
and
withered
by
the
use
of
ceruse
and
by
nights
of
dissipation
there
were
other
more
personal
and
perverse
pleasures
which
he
enjoyed
in
these
languorous
surroundings
pleasures
which
in
some
way
stimulated
memories
of
his
past
pains
and
dead
ennuis
as
a
souvenir
of
the
hated
days
of
his
childhood
he
had
suspended
from
the
ceiling
a
small
cage
where
a
captive
cricket
sang
as
if
in
the
ashes
of
the
chimneys
of
the
chateau
de
lourps
listening
to
the
sound
he
had
so
often
heard
before
he
lived
over
again
the
silent
evenings
spent
near
his
mother
the
wretchedness
of
his
suffering
repressed
youth
and
then
while
he
yielded
to
the
voluptuousness
of
the
woman
he
mechanically
caressed
whose
words
or
laughter
tore
him
from
his
revery
and
rudely
recalled
him
to
the
moment
to
the
boudoir
to
reality
a
tumult
arose
in
his
soul
a
need
of
avenging
the
sad
years
he
had
endured
a
mad
wish
to
sully
the
recollections
of
his
family
by
shameful
action
a
furious
desire
to
pant
on
cushions
of
flesh
to
drain
to
their
last
dregs
the
most
violent
of
carnal
vices
on
rainy
autumnal
days
when
melancholy
oppressed
him
when
a
hatred
of
his
home
the
muddy
yellow
skies
the
macadam
clouds
assailed
him
he
took
refuge
in
this
retreat
set
the
cage
lightly
in
motion
and
watched
it
endlessly
reflected
in
the
play
of
the
mirrors
until
it
seemed
to
his
dazed
eyes
that
the
cage
no
longer
stirred
but
that
the
boudoir
reeled
and
turned
filling
the
house
with
a
waltz
in
the
days
when
he
had
deemed
it
necessary
to
affect
singularity
des
esseintes
had
designed
marvelously
strange
furnishings
dividing
his
salon
into
a
series
of
alcoves
hung
with
varied
tapestries
to
relate
by
a
subtle
analogy
by
a
vague
harmony
of
joyous
or
sombre
delicate
or
barbaric
colors
to
the
character
of
the
latin
or
french
books
he
loved
and
he
would
seclude
himself
in
turn
in
the
particular
recess
whose
seemed
best
to
correspond
with
the
very
essence
of
the
work
his
caprice
of
the
moment
induced
him
to
read
he
had
constructed
too
a
lofty
high
room
intended
for
the
reception
of
his
tradesmen
here
they
were
ushered
in
and
seated
alongside
each
other
in
church
pews
while
from
a
pulpit
he
preached
to
them
a
sermon
on
dandyism
adjuring
his
bootmakers
and
tailors
implicitly
to
obey
his
briefs
in
the
matter
of
style
threatening
them
with
pecuniary
excommunication
if
they
failed
to
follow
to
the
letter
the
instructions
contained
in
his
monitories
and
bulls
he
acquired
the
reputation
of
an
eccentric
which
he
enhanced
by
wearing
costumes
of
white
velvet
and
waistcoats
by
inserting
in
place
of
a
cravat
a
parma
bouquet
in
the
opening
of
his
shirt
by
giving
famous
dinners
to
men
of
letters
one
of
which
a
revival
of
the
eighteenth
century
celebrating
the
most
futile
of
his
misadventures
was
a
funeral
repast
in
the
dining
room
hung
in
black
and
opening
on
the
transformed
garden
with
its
walks
its
little
pool
now
bordered
with
basalt
and
filled
with
ink
its
clumps
of
cypresses
and
pines
the
dinner
had
been
served
on
a
table
draped
in
black
adorned
with
baskets
of
violets
and
scabiouses
lit
by
candelabra
from
which
green
flames
blazed
and
by
chandeliers
from
which
wax
tapers
flared
to
the
sound
of
funeral
marches
played
by
a
concealed
orchestra
nude
negresses
wearing
slippers
and
stockings
of
silver
cloth
with
patterns
of
tears
served
the
guests
out
of
plates
they
had
drunk
turtle
soup
and
eaten
russian
rye
bread
ripe
turkish
olives
caviar
smoked
frankfort
black
pudding
game
with
sauces
that
were
the
color
of
licorice
and
blacking
truffle
gravy
chocolate
cream
puddings
nectarines
grape
preserves
mulberries
and
cherries
they
had
sipped
out
of
dark
glasses
wines
from
limagne
roussillon
tenedos
val
de
penas
and
porto
and
after
the
coffee
and
walnut
brandy
had
partaken
of
kvas
and
porter
and
stout
the
farewell
dinner
to
a
temporarily
dead
virility
this
was
what
he
had
written
on
invitation
cards
designed
like
bereavement
notices
but
he
was
done
with
those
extravagances
in
which
he
had
once
gloried
today
he
was
filled
with
a
contempt
for
those
juvenile
displays
the
singular
apparel
the
appointments
of
his
bizarre
chambers
he
contented
himself
with
planning
for
his
own
pleasure
and
no
longer
for
the
astonishment
of
others
an
interior
that
should
be
comfortable
although
embellished
in
a
rare
style
with
building
a
curious
calm
retreat
to
serve
the
needs
of
his
future
solitude
when
the
fontenay
house
was
in
readiness
fitted
up
by
an
architect
according
to
his
plans
when
all
that
remained
was
to
determine
the
color
scheme
he
again
devoted
himself
to
long
speculations
he
desired
colors
whose
expressiveness
would
be
displayed
in
the
artificial
light
of
lamps
to
him
it
mattered
not
at
all
if
they
were
lifeless
or
crude
in
daylight
for
it
was
at
night
that
he
lived
feeling
more
completely
alone
then
feeling
that
only
under
the
protective
covering
of
darkness
did
the
mind
grow
really
animated
and
active
he
also
experienced
a
peculiar
pleasure
in
being
in
a
richly
illuminated
room
the
only
patch
of
light
amid
the
sleeping
houses
this
was
a
form
of
enjoyment
in
which
perhaps
entered
an
element
of
vanity
that
peculiar
pleasure
known
to
late
workers
when
drawing
aside
the
window
curtains
they
perceive
that
everything
about
them
is
extinguished
silent
dead
slowly
one
by
one
he
selected
the
colors
blue
inclines
to
a
false
green
by
candle
light
if
it
is
dark
like
cobalt
or
indigo
it
turns
black
if
it
is
bright
it
turns
grey
if
it
is
soft
like
turquoise
it
grows
feeble
and
faded
there
could
be
no
question
of
making
it
the
dominant
note
of
a
room
unless
it
were
blended
with
some
other
color
iron
grey
always
frowns
and
is
heavy
pearl
grey
loses
its
blue
and
changes
to
a
muddy
white
brown
is
lifeless
and
cold
as
for
deep
green
such
as
emperor
or
myrtle
it
has
the
same
properties
as
blue
and
merges
into
black
there
remained
then
the
paler
greens
such
as
peacock
cinnabar
or
lacquer
but
the
light
banishes
their
blues
and
brings
out
their
yellows
in
tones
that
have
a
false
and
undecided
quality
no
need
to
waste
thought
on
the
salmon
the
maize
and
rose
colors
whose
feminine
associations
oppose
all
ideas
of
isolation
no
need
to
consider
the
violet
which
is
completely
neutralized
at
night
only
the
red
in
it
holds
its
ground
and
what
a
red
a
viscous
red
like
the
lees
of
wine
besides
it
seemed
useless
to
employ
this
color
for
by
using
a
certain
amount
of
santonin
he
could
get
an
effect
of
violet
on
his
hangings
these
colors
disposed
of
only
three
remained
red
orange
yellow
of
these
he
preferred
orange
thus
by
his
own
example
confirming
the
truth
of
a
theory
which
he
declared
had
almost
mathematical
correctness
the
theory
that
a
harmony
exists
between
the
sensual
nature
of
a
truly
artistic
individual
and
the
color
which
most
vividly
impresses
him
disregarding
entirely
the
generality
of
men
whose
gross
retinas
are
capable
of
perceiving
neither
the
cadence
peculiar
to
each
color
nor
the
mysterious
charm
of
their
nuances
of
light
and
shade
ignoring
the
bourgeoisie
whose
eyes
are
insensible
to
the
pomp
and
splendor
of
strong
vibrant
tones
and
devoting
himself
only
to
people
with
sensitive
pupils
refined
by
literature
and
art
he
was
convinced
that
the
eyes
of
those
among
them
who
dream
of
the
ideal
and
demand
illusions
are
generally
caressed
by
blue
and
its
derivatives
mauve
lilac
and
pearl
grey
provided
always
that
these
colors
remain
soft
and
do
not
overstep
the
bounds
where
they
lose
their
personalities
by
being
transformed
into
pure
violets
and
frank
greys
those
persons
on
the
contrary
who
are
energetic
and
incisive
the
plethoric
strong
males
who
fling
themselves
unthinkingly
into
the
affair
of
the
moment
generally
delight
in
the
bold
gleams
of
yellows
and
reds
the
clashing
cymbals
of
vermilions
and
chromes
that
blind
and
intoxicate
them
but
the
eyes
of
enfeebled
and
nervous
persons
whose
sensual
appetites
crave
highly
seasoned
foods
the
eyes
of
hectic
and
creatures
have
a
predilection
toward
that
irritating
and
morbid
color
with
its
fictitious
splendors
its
acid
fevers
orange
thus
there
could
be
no
question
about
des
esseintes
choice
but
unquestionable
difficulties
still
arose
if
red
and
yellow
are
heightened
by
light
the
same
does
not
always
hold
true
of
their
compound
orange
which
often
seems
to
ignite
and
turns
to
nasturtium
to
a
flaming
red
he
studied
all
their
nuances
by
candlelight
discovering
a
shade
which
it
seemed
to
him
would
not
lose
its
dominant
tone
but
would
stand
every
test
required
of
it
these
preliminaries
completed
he
sought
to
refrain
from
using
for
his
study
at
least
oriental
stuffs
and
rugs
which
have
become
cheapened
and
ordinary
now
that
rich
merchants
can
easily
pick
them
up
at
auctions
and
shops
he
finally
decided
to
bind
his
walls
like
books
with
morocco
with
cape
skin
polished
by
strong
steel
plates
under
a
powerful
press
when
the
wainscoting
was
finished
he
had
the
moulding
and
high
plinths
painted
in
indigo
a
lacquered
indigo
like
that
which
coachmakers
employ
for
carriage
panels
the
ceiling
slightly
rounded
was
also
lined
with
morocco
in
the
center
was
a
wide
opening
resembling
an
immense
bull
eye
encased
in
orange
skin
a
circle
of
the
firmament
worked
out
on
a
background
of
king
blue
silk
on
which
were
woven
silver
seraphim
with
wings
this
material
had
long
before
been
embroidered
by
the
cologne
guild
of
weavers
for
an
old
cope
the
setting
was
complete
at
night
the
room
subsided
into
a
restful
soothing
harmony
the
wainscoting
preserved
its
blue
which
seemed
sustained
and
warmed
by
the
orange
and
the
orange
remained
pure
strengthened
and
fanned
as
it
was
by
the
insistent
breath
of
the
blues
des
esseintes
was
not
deeply
concerned
about
the
furniture
itself
the
only
luxuries
in
the
room
were
books
and
rare
flowers
he
limited
himself
to
these
things
intending
later
on
to
hang
a
few
drawings
or
paintings
on
the
panels
which
remained
bare
to
place
shelves
and
book
racks
of
ebony
around
the
walls
to
spread
the
pelts
of
wild
beasts
and
the
skins
of
blue
fox
on
the
floor
to
install
near
a
massive
fifteenth
century
deep
armchairs
and
an
old
chapel
of
forged
iron
one
of
those
old
lecterns
on
which
the
deacon
formerly
placed
the
antiphonary
and
which
now
supported
one
of
the
heavy
folios
of
du
cange
mediae
et
infimae
the
windows
whose
blue
fissured
panes
stippled
with
fragments
of
bottles
intercepted
the
view
of
the
country
and
only
permitted
a
faint
light
to
enter
were
draped
with
curtains
cut
from
old
stoles
of
dark
and
reddish
gold
neutralized
by
an
almost
dead
russet
woven
in
the
pattern
the
mantel
shelf
was
sumptuously
draped
with
the
remnant
of
a
florentine
dalmatica
between
two
gilded
copper
monstrances
of
byzantine
style
originally
brought
from
the
old
de
bievre
stood
a
marvelous
church
canon
divided
into
three
separate
compartments
delicately
wrought
like
lace
work
it
contained
under
its
glass
frame
three
works
of
baudelaire
copied
on
real
vellum
with
wonderful
missal
letters
and
splendid
coloring
to
the
right
and
left
the
sonnets
bearing
the
titles
of
mort
des
and
in
the
center
the
prose
poem
entitled
out
of
the
world
ou
hors
du
chapter
after
selling
his
effects
des
esseintes
retained
the
two
old
domestics
who
had
tended
his
mother
and
filled
the
offices
of
steward
and
house
porter
at
the
chateau
de
lourps
which
had
remained
deserted
and
uninhabited
until
its
disposal
these
servants
he
brought
to
fontenay
they
were
accustomed
to
the
regular
life
of
hospital
attendants
hourly
serving
the
patients
their
stipulated
food
and
drink
to
the
rigid
silence
of
cloistral
monks
who
live
behind
barred
doors
and
windows
having
no
communication
with
the
outside
world
the
man
was
assigned
the
task
of
keeping
the
house
in
order
and
of
procuring
provisions
the
woman
that
of
preparing
the
food
he
surrendered
the
second
story
to
them
forced
them
to
wear
heavy
felt
coverings
over
their
shoes
put
sound
mufflers
along
the
doors
and
covered
their
floor
with
heavy
rugs
so
that
he
would
never
hear
their
footsteps
overhead
he
devised
an
elaborate
signal
code
of
bells
whereby
his
wants
were
made
known
he
pointed
out
the
exact
spot
on
his
bureau
where
they
were
to
place
the
account
book
each
month
while
he
slept
in
short
matters
were
arranged
in
such
wise
that
he
would
not
be
obliged
to
see
or
to
converse
with
them
very
often
nevertheless
since
the
woman
had
occasion
to
walk
past
the
house
so
as
to
reach
the
woodshed
he
wished
to
make
sure
that
her
shadow
as
she
passed
his
windows
would
not
offend
him
he
had
designed
for
her
a
costume
of
flemish
silk
with
a
white
bonnet
and
large
black
lowered
hood
such
as
is
still
worn
by
the
nuns
of
ghent
the
shadow
of
this
headdress
in
the
twilight
gave
him
the
sensation
of
being
in
a
cloister
brought
back
memories
of
silent
holy
villages
dead
quarters
enclosed
and
buried
in
some
quiet
corner
of
a
bustling
town
the
hours
of
eating
were
also
regulated
his
instructions
in
this
regard
were
short
and
explicit
for
the
weakened
state
of
his
stomach
no
longer
permitted
him
to
absorb
heavy
or
varied
foods
in
winter
at
five
in
the
afternoon
when
the
day
was
drawing
to
a
close
he
breakfasted
on
two
boiled
eggs
toast
and
tea
at
eleven
he
dined
during
the
night
he
drank
coffee
and
sometimes
tea
and
wine
and
at
five
in
the
morning
before
retiring
he
supped
again
lightly
his
meals
which
were
planned
and
ordered
once
for
all
at
the
beginning
of
each
season
were
served
him
on
a
table
in
the
middle
of
a
small
room
separated
from
his
study
by
a
padded
corridor
hermetically
sealed
so
as
to
permit
neither
sound
nor
odor
to
filter
into
either
of
the
two
rooms
it
joined
with
its
vaulted
ceiling
fitted
with
beams
in
a
half
circle
its
bulkheads
and
floor
of
pine
and
the
little
window
in
the
wainscoting
that
looked
like
a
porthole
the
dining
room
resembled
the
cabin
of
a
ship
like
those
japanese
boxes
which
fit
into
each
other
this
room
was
inserted
in
a
larger
apartment
the
real
dining
room
constructed
by
the
architect
it
was
pierced
by
two
windows
one
of
them
was
invisible
hidden
by
a
partition
which
could
however
be
lowered
by
a
spring
so
as
to
permit
fresh
air
to
circulate
around
this
pinewood
box
and
to
penetrate
into
it
the
other
was
visible
placed
directly
opposite
the
porthole
built
in
the
wainscoting
but
it
was
blocked
up
for
a
long
aquarium
occupied
the
entire
space
between
the
porthole
and
the
genuine
window
placed
in
the
outer
wall
thus
the
light
in
order
to
brighten
the
room
traversed
the
window
whose
panes
had
been
replaced
by
a
plate
glass
the
water
and
lastly
the
window
of
the
porthole
in
autumn
at
sunset
when
the
steam
rose
from
the
samovar
on
the
table
the
water
of
the
aquarium
wan
and
glassy
all
during
the
morning
reddened
like
blazing
gleams
of
embers
and
lapped
restlessly
against
the
wood
sometimes
when
it
chanced
that
des
esseintes
was
awake
in
the
afternoon
he
operated
the
stops
of
the
pipes
and
conduits
which
emptied
the
aquarium
replacing
it
with
pure
water
into
this
he
poured
drops
of
colored
liquids
that
made
it
green
or
brackish
opaline
or
silvery
tones
similar
to
those
of
rivers
which
reflect
the
color
of
the
sky
the
intensity
of
the
sun
the
menace
of
rain
which
reflect
in
a
word
the
state
of
the
season
and
atmosphere
when
he
did
this
he
imagined
himself
on
a
brig
between
decks
and
curiously
he
contemplated
the
marvelous
mechanical
fish
wound
like
clocks
which
passed
before
the
porthole
or
clung
to
the
artificial
while
he
inhaled
the
odor
of
tar
introduced
into
the
room
shortly
before
his
arrival
he
examined
colored
engravings
hung
on
the
walls
which
represented
just
as
at
lloyd
office
and
the
steamship
agencies
steamers
bound
for
valparaiso
and
la
platte
and
looked
at
framed
pictures
on
which
were
inscribed
the
itineraries
of
the
royal
mail
steam
packet
the
lopez
and
the
valery
companies
the
freight
and
port
calls
of
the
atlantic
mail
boats
if
he
tired
of
consulting
these
guides
he
could
rest
his
eyes
by
gazing
at
the
chronometers
and
sea
compasses
the
sextants
field
glasses
and
cards
strewn
on
a
table
on
which
stood
a
single
volume
bound
in
sealskin
the
book
was
the
adventures
of
arthur
gordon
pym
specially
printed
for
him
on
laid
paper
each
sheet
carefully
selected
with
a
watermark
or
he
could
look
at
fishing
rods
nets
rolls
of
russet
sail
a
tiny
cork
anchor
all
thrown
in
a
heap
near
the
door
communicating
with
the
kitchen
by
a
passage
furnished
with
cappadine
silk
which
reabsorbed
just
as
in
the
corridor
which
connected
the
dining
room
with
his
study
every
odor
and
sound
thus
without
stirring
he
enjoyed
the
rapid
motions
of
a
long
sea
voyage
the
pleasure
of
travel
which
only
exists
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
retrospect
and
seldom
in
the
present
at
the
instant
when
it
is
being
experienced
he
could
fully
relish
at
his
ease
without
the
necessity
of
fatigue
or
confusion
here
in
this
cabin
whose
studied
disorder
whose
transitory
appearance
and
whose
seemingly
temporary
furnishings
corresponded
so
well
with
the
briefness
of
the
time
he
spent
there
on
his
meals
and
contrasted
so
perfectly
with
his
study
a
room
where
everything
betokened
a
retired
orderly
existence
movement
after
all
seemed
futile
to
him
he
felt
that
imagination
could
easily
be
substituted
for
the
vulgar
realities
of
things
it
was
possible
in
his
opinion
to
gratify
the
most
extravagant
absurd
desires
by
a
subtle
subterfuge
by
a
slight
modification
of
the
object
of
one
wishes
every
epicure
nowadays
enjoys
in
restaurants
celebrated
for
the
excellence
of
their
cellars
wines
of
capital
taste
manufactured
from
inferior
brands
treated
by
pasteur
method
for
they
have
the
same
aroma
the
same
color
the
same
bouquet
as
the
rare
wines
of
which
they
are
an
imitation
and
consequently
the
pleasure
experienced
in
sipping
them
is
identical
the
originals
moreover
are
usually
unprocurable
for
love
or
money
transposing
this
insidious
deviation
this
adroit
deceit
into
the
realm
of
the
intellect
there
was
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
fanciful
delights
resembling
the
true
in
every
detail
could
be
enjoyed
one
could
revel
for
instance
in
long
explorations
while
near
one
own
fireside
stimulating
the
restive
or
sluggish
mind
if
need
be
by
reading
some
suggestive
narrative
of
travel
in
distant
lands
one
could
enjoy
the
beneficent
results
of
a
sea
bath
too
even
in
paris
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
visit
the
vigier
baths
situated
in
a
boat
on
the
seine
far
from
the
shore
there
the
illusion
of
the
sea
is
undeniable
imperious
positive
it
is
achieved
by
salting
the
water
of
the
bath
by
mixing
according
to
the
codex
formula
sulphate
of
soda
hydrochlorate
of
magnesia
and
lime
by
extracting
from
a
box
carefully
closed
by
means
of
a
screw
a
ball
of
thread
or
a
very
small
piece
of
cable
which
had
been
specially
procured
from
one
of
those
great
establishments
whose
vast
warehouses
and
basements
are
heavy
with
odors
of
the
sea
and
the
port
by
inhaling
these
perfumes
held
by
the
ball
or
the
cable
end
by
consulting
an
exact
photograph
of
the
casino
by
eagerly
reading
the
joanne
guide
describing
the
beauties
of
the
seashore
where
one
would
wish
to
be
by
being
rocked
on
the
waves
made
by
the
eddy
of
fly
boats
lapping
against
the
pontoon
of
baths
by
listening
to
the
plaint
of
the
wind
under
the
arches
or
to
the
hollow
murmur
of
the
omnibuses
passing
above
on
the
port
royal
two
steps
away
the
secret
lies
in
knowing
how
to
proceed
how
to
concentrate
deeply
enough
to
produce
the
hallucination
and
succeed
in
substituting
the
dream
reality
for
the
reality
itself
artifice
besides
seemed
to
des
esseintes
the
final
distinctive
mark
of
man
genius
nature
had
had
her
day
as
he
put
it
by
the
disgusting
sameness
of
her
landscapes
and
skies
she
had
once
for
all
wearied
the
considerate
patience
of
aesthetes
really
what
dullness
the
dullness
of
the
specialist
confined
to
his
narrow
work
what
manners
the
manners
of
the
tradesman
offering
one
particular
ware
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
what
a
monotonous
storehouse
of
fields
and
trees
what
a
banal
agency
of
mountains
and
seas
there
is
not
one
of
her
inventions
no
matter
how
subtle
or
imposing
it
may
be
which
human
genius
can
not
create
no
fontainebleau
forest
no
moonlight
which
a

setting
flooded
with
electricity

which

there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
this
eternal
driveling
old
woman
is
no
longer
admired
by
true
artists
and
the
moment
has
come
to
replace
her
by
artifice
closely
observe
that
work
of
hers
which
is
considered
the
most
exquisite
that
creation
of
hers
whose
beauty
is
everywhere
conceded
the
most
perfect
and
original
woman
has
not
man
made
for
his
own
use
an
animated
and
artificial
being
which
easily
equals
woman
from
the
point
of
view
of
plastic
beauty
is
there
a
woman
whose
form
is
more
dazzling
more
splendid
than
the
two
locomotives
that
pass
over
the
northern
railroad
lines
one
the
crampton
is
an
adorable
blonde
a
trim
gilded
blonde
with
a
large
fragile
body
imprisoned
in
a
glittering
corset
of
copper
and
having
the
long
sinewy
lines
of
a
cat
her
extraordinary
grace
is
frightening
as
with
the
sweat
of
her
hot
sides
rising
upwards
and
her
steel
muscles
stiffening
she
puts
in
motion
the
immense
of
her
fine
wheels
and
darts
forward
mettlesome
along
rapids
and
floods
the
other
the
engerth
is
a
nobly
proportioned
dusky
brunette
emitting
raucous
muffled
cries
her
heavy
loins
are
strangled
in
a
a
monstrous
beast
with
a
disheveled
mane
of
black
smoke
and
with
six
low
coupled
wheels
what
irresistible
power
she
has
when
causing
the
earth
to
tremble
she
slowly
and
heavily
drags
the
unwieldy
queue
of
her
merchandise
unquestionably
there
is
not
one
among
the
frail
blondes
and
majestic
brunettes
of
the
flesh
that
can
vie
with
their
delicate
grace
and
terrific
strength
such
were
des
esseintes
reflections
when
the
breeze
brought
him
the
faint
whistle
of
the
toy
railroad
winding
playfully
like
a
spinning
top
between
paris
and
sceaux
his
house
was
situated
at
a
twenty
minutes
walk
from
the
fontenay
station
but
the
height
on
which
it
was
perched
its
isolation
made
it
immune
to
the
clatter
of
the
noisy
rabble
which
the
vicinity
of
a
railway
station
invariably
attracts
on
a
sunday
as
for
the
village
itself
he
hardly
knew
it
one
night
he
had
gazed
through
his
window
at
the
silent
landscape
which
slowly
unfolded
as
it
dipped
to
the
foot
of
a
slope
on
whose
summit
the
batteries
of
the
verrieres
woods
were
trained
in
the
darkness
to
left
and
right
these
masses
dim
and
confused
rose
tier
on
tier
dominated
far
off
by
other
batteries
and
forts
whose
high
embankments
seemed
in
the
moonlight
bathed
in
silver
against
the
sombre
sky
where
the
plain
did
not
fall
under
the
shadow
of
the
hills
it
seemed
powdered
with
starch
and
smeared
with
white
cold
cream
in
the
warm
air
that
fanned
the
faded
grasses
and
exhaled
a
spicy
perfume
the
trees
chalky
white
under
the
moon
shook
their
pale
leaves
and
seemed
to
divide
their
trunks
whose
shadows
formed
bars
of
black
on
the
ground
where
pebbles
scintillated
like
glittering
plates
because
of
its
enameled
look
and
its
artificial
air
the
landscape
did
not
displease
des
esseintes
but
since
that
afternoon
spent
at
fontenay
in
search
of
a
house
he
had
never
ventured
along
its
roads
in
daylight
the
verdure
of
this
region
inspired
him
with
no
interest
whatever
for
it
did
not
have
the
delicate
and
doleful
charm
of
the
sickly
and
pathetic
vegetation
which
forces
its
way
painfully
through
the
rubbish
heaps
of
the
mounds
which
had
once
served
as
the
ramparts
of
paris
that
day
in
the
village
he
had
perceived
corpulent
bewhiskered
citizens
and
moustached
uniformed
men
with
heads
of
magistrates
and
soldiers
which
they
held
as
stiffly
as
monstrances
in
churches
and
ever
since
that
encounter
his
detestation
of
the
human
face
had
been
augmented
during
the
last
month
of
his
stay
in
paris
when
he
was
weary
of
everything
afflicted
with
hypochondria
the
prey
of
melancholia
when
his
nerves
had
become
so
sensitive
that
the
sight
of
an
unpleasant
object
or
person
impressed
itself
deeply
on
his
brain
so
deeply
that
several
days
were
required
before
the
impression
could
be
effaced
the
touch
of
a
human
body
brushing
against
him
in
the
street
had
been
an
excruciating
agony
the
very
sight
of
certain
faces
made
him
suffer
he
considered
the
crabbed
expressions
of
some
insulting
he
felt
a
desire
to
slap
the
fellow
who
walked
eyes
closed
with
such
a
learned
air
the
one
who
minced
along
smiling
at
his
image
in
the
window
panes
and
the
one
who
seemed
stimulated
by
a
whole
world
of
thought
while
devouring
with
contracted
brow
the
tedious
contents
of
a
newspaper
such
an
inveterate
stupidity
such
a
scorn
for
literature
and
art
such
a
hatred
for
all
the
ideas
he
worshipped
were
implanted
and
anchored
in
these
merchant
minds
exclusively
preoccupied
with
the
business
of
swindling
and
and
accessible
only
to
ideas
of
politics
that
base
distraction
of
mediocrities
that
he
returned
enraged
to
his
home
and
locked
himself
in
with
his
books
he
hated
the
new
generation
with
all
the
energy
in
him
they
were
frightful
clodhoppers
who
seemed
to
find
it
necessary
to
talk
and
laugh
boisterously
in
restaurants
and
cafes
they
jostled
you
on
sidewalks
without
begging
pardon
they
pushed
the
wheels
of
their
perambulators
against
your
legs
without
even
apologizing
chapter
a
portion
of
the
shelves
which
lined
the
walls
of
his
orange
and
blue
study
was
devoted
exclusively
to
those
latin
works
assigned
to
the
generic
period
of
the
decadence
by
those
whose
minds
have
absorbed
the
deplorable
teachings
of
the
sorbonne
the
latin
written
in
that
era
which
professors
still
persist
in
calling
the
great
age
hardly
stimulated
des
esseintes
with
its
carefully
premeditated
style
its
sameness
its
stripping
of
supple
syntax
its
poverty
of
color
and
nuance
this
language
pruned
of
all
the
rugged
and
often
rich
expressions
of
the
preceding
ages
was
confined
to
the
enunciation
of
the
majestic
banalities
the
empty
commonplaces
tiresomely
reiterated
by
the
rhetoricians
and
poets
but
it
betrayed
such
a
lack
of
curiosity
and
such
a
humdrum
tediousness
such
a
drabness
feebleness
and
jaded
solemnity
that
to
find
its
equal
it
was
necessary
in
linguistic
studies
to
go
to
the
french
style
of
the
period
of
louis
xiv
the
gentle
vergil
whom
instructors
call
the
mantuan
swan
perhaps
because
he
was
not
born
in
that
city
he
considered
one
of
the
most
terrible
pedants
ever
produced
by
antiquity
des
esseintes
was
exasperated
by
his
immaculate
and
bedizened
shepherds
his
orpheus
whom
he
compares
to
a
weeping
nightingale
his
aristaeus
who
simpers
about
bees
his
aeneas
that
irresolute
person
who
walks
with
wooden
gestures
through
the
length
of
the
poem
des
esseintes
would
gladly
have
accepted
the
tedious
nonsense
which
those
marionettes
exchange
with
each
other
or
even
the
impudent
borrowings
from
homer
theocritus
ennius
and
lucretius
the
plain
theft
revealed
to
us
by
macrobius
of
the
second
song
of
the
copied
almost
word
for
word
from
one
of
pisander
poems
in
fine
all
the
unutterable
emptiness
of
this
heap
of
verses
the
thing
he
could
not
forgive
however
and
which
infuriated
him
most
was
the
workmanship
of
the
hexameters
beating
like
empty
tin
cans
and
extending
their
syllabic
quantities
measured
according
to
the
unchanging
rule
of
a
pedantic
and
dull
prosody
he
disliked
the
texture
of
those
stiff
verses
in
their
official
garb
their
abject
reverence
for
grammar
their
mechanical
division
by
imperturbable
caesuras
always
plugged
at
the
end
in
the
same
way
by
the
impact
of
a
dactyl
against
a
spondee
borrowed
from
the
perfected
forge
of
catullus
this
unvarying
versification
lacking
imagination
lacking
pity
padded
with
useless
words
and
refuse
with
pegs
of
identical
and
anticipated
assonances
this
ceaseless
wretchedness
of
homeric
epithet
which
designates
nothing
whatever
and
permits
nothing
to
be
seen
all
this
impoverished
vocabulary
of
muffled
lifeless
tones
bored
him
beyond
measure
it
is
no
more
than
just
to
add
that
if
his
admiration
for
vergil
was
quite
restrained
and
his
attraction
for
ovid
lucid
outpourings
even
more
circumspect
there
was
no
limit
to
his
disgust
at
the
elephantine
graces
of
horace
at
the
prattle
of
this
hopeless
lout
who
smirkingly
utters
the
broad
crude
jests
of
an
old
clown
neither
was
he
pleased
in
prose
with
the
verbosities
the
redundant
metaphors
the
ludicrous
digressions
of
cicero
there
was
nothing
to
beguile
him
in
the
boasting
of
his
apostrophes
in
the
flow
of
his
patriotic
nonsense
in
the
emphasis
of
his
harangues
in
the
ponderousness
of
his
style
fleshy
but
ropy
and
lacking
in
marrow
and
bone
in
the
insupportable
dross
of
his
long
adverbs
with
which
he
introduces
phrases
in
the
unalterable
formula
of
his
adipose
periods
badly
sewed
together
with
the
thread
of
conjunctions
and
finally
in
his
wearisome
habits
of
tautology
nor
was
his
enthusiasm
wakened
for
caesar
celebrated
for
his
laconic
style
here
on
the
contrary
was
disclosed
a
surprising
aridity
a
sterility
of
recollection
an
incredibly
undue
constipation
he
found
pasture
neither
among
them
nor
among
those
writers
who
are
peculiarly
the
delight
of
the
spuriously
literate
sallust
who
is
less
colorless
than
the
others
sentimental
and
pompous
titus
livius
turgid
and
lurid
seneca
watery
and
larval
suetonius
tacitus
who
in
his
studied
conciseness
is
the
keenest
most
wiry
and
muscular
of
them
all
in
poetry
he
was
untouched
by
juvenal
despite
some
roughshod
verses
and
by
persius
despite
his
mysterious
insinuations
in
neglecting
tibullus
and
propertius
quintilian
and
the
plinies
statius
martial
even
terence
and
plautus
whose
jargon
full
of
neologisms
compound
words
and
diminutives
could
please
him
but
whose
low
comedy
and
gross
humor
he
loathed
des
esseintes
only
began
to
be
interested
in
the
latin
language
with
lucan
here
it
was
liberated
already
more
expressive
and
less
dull
this
careful
armor
these
verses
plated
with
enamel
and
studded
with
jewels
captivated
him
but
the
exclusive
preoccupation
with
form
the
sonorities
of
tone
the
clangor
of
metals
did
not
entirely
conceal
from
him
the
emptiness
of
the
thought
the
turgidity
of
those
blisters
which
emboss
the
skin
of
the
petronius
was
the
author
whom
he
truly
loved
and
who
caused
him
forever
to
abandon
the
sonorous
ingenuities
of
lucan
for
he
was
a
keen
observer
a
delicate
analyst
a
marvelous
painter
tranquilly
without
prejudice
or
hate
he
described

recounting
the
customs
of
his
epoch
in
the
sprightly
little
chapters
of
the
observing
the
facts
of

stating
them
in
clear
definite
form
he
revealed
the
petty
existence
of
the

their
happenings
their
bestialities
their
passions

him
the

was
at
its

in

it
contained

rushing
from

pouring

even

whom
he
perhaps
preserved
for
his
aldine
edition
more
than
for
the
work
itself
although
he
was
sufficiently
versed
in
theology
the
disputes
of
the
montanists
against

catholic

against

resting
on

clashing
with

bristling
with

witticisms
dappled
with
vocables
culled
from
the
juridical
science
and
the
language
of
the
fathers
of

greek
church
he
now
hardly
ever
opened
the
and
the
on
at
the
most
he
read
several
pages
of
culta
where
tertullian
counsels
women
not
to
bedeck
themselves
with
jewels
and

forbidding
them
the
use
of

because
these
attempt

correct

improve

these
ideas
diametrically
opposed
to
his
own
made
him
smile
then
the
role
played
by
tertullian
in
his
carthage
bishopric
seemed
to
him
suggestive
in
pleasant
reveries
more
even
than
his
works
did
the
man
attract
him
he
had
in
fact
lived
in
stormy
times
agitated
by
frightful
disorders
under
caracalla
under
macrinus
under
the
astonishing
high
priest
of
emesa
elagabalus
and
he
tranquilly
prepared
his
sermons
his
dogmatic
writings
his
pleadings
his
homelies
while
the
roman
empire
shook
on
its
foundations
while
the
follies
of
asia
while
the
ordures
of
paganism
were
full
to
the
brim
with
the
utmost
he
recommended
carnal
abstinence
frugality
in
food
sobriety
in
dress
while
walking
in
silver
powder
and
golden
sand

tiara
on
his
head

garb
figured
with
precious
stones
elagabalus
worked
amid
his
eunuchs
at
womanish
labor
calling
himself
the
empress
and
changing
every
night
his
emperor
whom
he
preferably
chose
among
barbers
scullions
and
circus
drivers
this
antithesis
delighted
him
then
the
latin
language
arrived
at
its
supreme
maturity
under
petronius
commenced
to
decay
the
christian
literature
replaced
it
bringing
new
words
with
new
ideas
unemployed
constructions
strange
verbs
adjectives
with
subtle
meanings
abstract
words
until
then
rare
in
the
roman

whose
usage
tertullian
had
been
one
of
the
first
to

there
was

not
yet

special
flavor
which
in
the
fourth

during
the
centuries
following

would
give

his
poetic
recipes
and
the
very
strange
virtues
which
he
ascribes
to
certain
plants
and
flowers
to
the
aristolochia
for
example
which
mixed
with
the
flesh
of
a
cow
and
placed
on
the
lower
part
of
a
pregnant
woman
abdomen
insures
the
birth
of
a
male
child
or
to
the
borage
which
when
brewed
into
an
infusion
in
a
dining
room
diverts
guests
or
to
the
peony
whose
powdered
roots
cure
epilepsy
or
to
the
fennel
which
if
placed
on
a
woman
breasts
clears
her
water
and
stimulates
the
indolence
of
her
periods
apart
from
several
special
unclassified
volumes
modern
or
dateless
certain
works
on
the
cabbala
medicine
and
botany
certain
odd
tomes
containing
undiscoverable
christian
poetry
and
the
anthology
of
the
minor
latin
poets
of
wernsdorf
apart
from
the
manual
of
classical
erotology
of
forberg
and
the
diaconals
used
by
confessors
which
he
dusted
at
rare
intervals
his
latin
library
ended
at
the
beginning
of
the
tenth
century
and
in
fact
the
curiosity
the
complicated
naivete
of
the
christian
language
had
also
foundered
the
balderdash
of
philosophers
and
scholars
the
logomachy
of
the
middle
ages
thenceforth
held
absolute
sway
the
sooty
mass
of
chronicles
and
historical
books
and
cartularies
accumulated
and
the
stammering
grace
the
often
exquisite
awkwardness
of
the
monks
placing
the
poetic
remains
of
antiquity
in
a
ragout
were
dead
the
fabrications
of
verbs
and
purified
essences
of
substantives
breathing
of
incense
of
bizarre
adjectives
coarsely
carved
from
gold
with
the
barbarous
and
charming
taste
of
gothic
jewels
were
destroyed
the
old
editions
beloved
by
des
esseintes
here
ended
and
with
a
formidable
leap
of
centuries
the
books
on
his
shelves
went
straight
to
the
french
language
of
the
present
century
chapter
the
afternoon
was
drawing
to
its
close
when
a
carriage
halted
in
front
of
the
fontenay
house
since
des
esseintes
received
no
visitors
and
since
the
postman
never
even
ventured
into
these
uninhabited
parts
having
no
occasion
to
deliver
any
papers
magazines
or
letters
the
servants
hesitated
before
opening
the
door
then
as
the
bell
was
rung
furiously
again
they
peered
through
the
cut
into
the
wall
and
perceived
a
man
concealed
from
neck
to
waist
behind
an
immense
gold
buckler
they
informed
their
master
who
was
breakfasting
ask
him
in
he
said
for
he
recalled
having
given
his
address
to
a
lapidary
for
the
delivery
of
a
purchase
the
man
bowed
and
deposited
the
buckler
on
the
pinewood
floor
of
the
dining
room
it
oscillated
and
wavered
revealing
the
serpentine
head
of
a
tortoise
which
suddenly
terrified
retreated
into
its
shell
this
tortoise
was
a
fancy
which
had
seized
des
esseintes
some
time
before
his
departure
from
paris
examining
an
oriental
rug
one
day
in
reflected
light
and
following
the
silver
gleams
which
fell
on
its
web
of
plum
violet
and
alladin
yellow
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
how
much
it
would
be
improved
if
he
could
place
on
it
some
object
whose
deep
color
might
enhance
the
vividness
of
its
tints
possessed
by
this
idea
he
had
been
strolling
aimlessly
along
the
streets
when
suddenly
he
found
himself
gazing
at
the
very
object
of
his
wishes
there
in
a
shop
window
on
the
palais
royal
lay
a
huge
tortoise
in
a
large
basin
he
had
purchased
it
then
he
had
sat
a
long
time
with
eyes
studying
the
effect
decidedly
the
ethiopic
black
the
harsh
sienna
tone
of
this
shell
dulled
the
rug
reflections
without
adding
to
it
the
dominant
silver
gleams
in
it
barely
sparkled
crawling
with
tones
of
dead
zinc
against
the
edges
of
the
hard
tarnished
shell
he
bit
his
nails
while
he
studied
a
method
of
removing
these
discords
and
reconciling
the
determined
opposition
of
the
tones
he
finally
discovered
that
his
first
inspiration
which
was
to
animate
the
fire
of
the
weave
by
setting
it
off
against
some
dark
object
was
erroneous
in
fact
this
rug
was
too
new
too
petulant
and
gaudy
the
colors
were
not
sufficiently
subdued
he
must
reverse
the
process
dull
the
tones
and
extinguish
them
by
the
contrast
of
a
striking
object
which
would
eclipse
all
else
and
cast
a
golden
light
on
the
pale
silver
thus
stated
the
problem
was
easier
to
solve
he
therefore
decided
to
glaze
the
shell
of
the
tortoise
with
gold
the
tortoise
just
returned
by
the
lapidary
shone
brilliantly
softening
the
tones
of
the
rug
and
casting
on
it
a
gorgeous
reflection
which
resembled
the
irradiations
from
the
scales
of
a
barbaric
visigoth
shield
at
first
des
esseintes
was
enchanted
with
this
effect
then
he
reflected
that
this
gigantic
jewel
was
only
in
outline
that
it
would
not
really
be
complete
until
it
had
been
incrusted
with
rare
stones
from
a
japanese
collection
he
chose
a
design
representing
a
cluster
of
flowers
emanating
from
a
slender
stalk
taking
it
to
a
jeweler
he
sketched
a
border
to
enclose
this
bouquet
in
an
oval
frame
and
informed
the
amazed
lapidary
that
every
petal
and
every
leaf
was
to
be
designed
with
jewels
and
mounted
on
the
scales
of
the
tortoise
the
choice
of
stones
made
him
pause
the
diamond
has
become
notoriously
common
since
every
tradesman
has
taken
to
wearing
it
on
his
little
finger
the
oriental
emeralds
and
rubies
are
less
vulgarized
and
cast
brilliant
rutilant
flames
but
they
remind
one
of
the
green
and
red
antennae
of
certain
omnibuses
which
carry
signal
lights
of
these
colors
as
for
topazes
whether
sparkling
or
dim
they
are
cheap
stones
precious
only
to
women
of
the
middle
class
who
like
to
have
jewel
cases
on
their
and
then
although
the
church
has
preserved
for
the
amethyst
a
sacerdotal
character
which
is
at
once
unctuous
and
solemn
this
stone
too
is
abused
on
the
ears
and
veined
hands
of
butchers
wives
who
love
to
adorn
themselves
inexpensively
with
real
and
heavy
jewels
only
the
sapphire
among
all
these
stones
has
kept
its
fires
undefiled
by
any
taint
of
commercialism
its
sparks
crackling
in
its
limpid
cold
depths
have
in
some
way
protected
its
shy
and
proud
nobility
from
pollution
unfortunately
its
fresh
fire
does
not
sparkle
in
artificial
light
the
blue
retreats
and
seems
to
fall
asleep
only
awakening
to
shine
at
daybreak
none
of
these
satisfied
des
esseintes
at
all
they
were
too
civilized
and
familiar
he
let
trickle
through
his
fingers
still
more
astonishing
and
bizarre
stones
and
finally
selected
a
number
of
real
and
artificial
ones
which
used
together
should
produce
a
fascinating
and
disconcerting
harmony
this
is
how
he
composed
his
bouquet
of
flowers
the
leaves
were
set
with
jewels
of
a
pronounced
distinct
green
the
chrysoberyls
of
asparagus
green
the
chrysolites
of
leek
green
the
olivines
of
olive
green
they
hung
from
branches
of
almandine
and
of
a
violet
red
darting
spangles
of
a
hard
brilliance
like
tartar
micas
gleaming
through
forest
depths
for
the
flowers
separated
from
the
stalk
and
removed
from
the
bottom
of
the
sheaf
he
used
blue
cinder
but
he
formally
waived
that
oriental
turquoise
used
for
brooches
and
rings
which
like
the
banal
pearl
and
the
odious
coral
serves
to
delight
people
of
no
importance
he
chose
occidental
turquoises
exclusively
stones
which
properly
speaking
are
only
a
fossil
ivory
impregnated
with
coppery
substances
whose
sea
blue
is
choked
opaque
sulphurous
as
though
yellowed
by
bile
this
done
he
could
now
set
the
petals
of
his
flowers
with
transparent
stones
which
had
morbid
and
vitreous
sparks
feverish
and
sharp
lights
he
composed
them
entirely
with
ceylon
cymophanes
and
blue
chalcedony
these
three
stones
darted
mysterious
and
perverse
scintillations
painfully
torn
from
the
frozen
depths
of
their
troubled
waters
the
of
a
greenish
grey
streaked
with
concentric
veins
which
seem
to
stir
and
change
constantly
according
to
the
dispositions
of
light
the
cymophane
whose
azure
waves
float
over
the
milky
tint
swimming
in
its
depths
the
blue
chalcedony
which
kindles
with
bluish
phosphorescent
fires
against
a
dead
brown
chocolate
background
the
lapidary
made
a
note
of
the
places
where
the
stones
were
to
be
inlaid
and
the
border
of
the
shell
he
asked
des
esseintes
at
first
he
had
thought
of
some
opals
and
hydrophanes
but
these
stones
interesting
for
their
hesitating
colors
for
the
evasions
of
their
flames
are
too
refractory
and
faithless
the
opal
has
a
quite
rheumatic
sensitiveness
the
play
of
its
rays
alters
according
to
the
humidity
the
warmth
or
cold
as
for
the
hydrophane
it
only
burns
in
water
and
only
consents
to
kindle
its
embers
when
moistened
he
finally
decided
on
minerals
whose
reflections
vary
for
the
compostelle
hyacinth
mahogany
red
the
beryl
glaucous
green
the
balas
ruby
vinegar
rose
the
sudermanian
ruby
pale
slate
their
feeble
sparklings
sufficed
to
light
the
darkness
of
the
shell
and
preserved
the
values
of
the
flowering
stones
which
they
encircled
with
a
slender
garland
of
vague
fires
des
esseintes
now
watched
the
tortoise
squatting
in
a
corner
of
the
dining
room
shining
in
the
shadow
he
was
perfectly
happy
his
eyes
gleamed
with
pleasure
at
the
resplendencies
of
the
flaming
corrollae
against
the
gold
background
then
he
grew
hungry
a
thing
that
rarely
if
ever
happened
to
him
and
dipped
his
toast
spread
with
a
special
butter
in
a
cup
of
tea
a
flawless
blend
of
siafayoune
moyoutann
and
khansky
yellow
teas
which
had
come
from
china
to
russia
by
special
caravans
this
liquid
perfume
he
drank
in
those
chinese
porcelains
called
so
light
and
diaphanous
they
are
and
as
an
accompaniment
to
these
adorable
cups
he
used
a
service
of
solid
silver
slightly
gilded
the
silver
showed
faintly
under
the
fatigued
layer
of
gold
which
gave
it
an
aged
quite
exhausted
and
moribund
tint
after
he
had
finished
his
tea
he
returned
to
his
study
and
had
the
servant
carry
in
the
tortoise
which
stubbornly
refused
to
budge
the
snow
was
falling
by
the
lamp
light
he
saw
the
icy
patterns
on
the
bluish
windows
and
the
like
melted
sugar
scintillating
in
the
stumps
of
bottles
spotted
with
gold
a
deep
silence
enveloped
the
cottage
drooping
in
shadow
des
esseintes
fell
into
revery
the
fireplace
piled
with
logs
gave
forth
a
smell
of
burning
wood
he
opened
the
window
slightly
like
a
high
tapestry
of
black
ermine
the
sky
rose
before
him
black
flecked
with
white
an
icy
wind
swept
past
accelerated
the
crazy
flight
of
the
snow
and
reversed
the
color
order
the
heraldic
tapestry
of
heaven
returned
became
a
true
ermine
a
white
flecked
with
black
in
its
turn
by
the
specks
of
darkness
dispersed
among
the
flakes
he
closed
the
window
this
abrupt
transition
from
torrid
warmth
to
cold
winter
affected
him
he
crouched
near
the
fire
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
needed
a
cordial
to
revive
his
flagging
spirits
he
went
to
the
dining
room
where
built
in
one
of
the
panels
was
a
closet
containing
a
number
of
tiny
casks
ranged
side
by
side
and
resting
on
small
stands
of
sandal
wood
this
collection
of
barrels
he
called
his
mouth
organ
a
stem
could
connect
all
the
spigots
and
control
them
by
a
single
movement
so
that
once
attached
he
had
only
to
press
a
button
concealed
in
the
woodwork
to
turn
on
all
the
taps
at
the
same
time
and
fill
the
mugs
placed
underneath
the
organ
was
now
open
the
stops
labelled
flute
horn
celestial
voice
were
pulled
out
ready
to
be
placed
des
esseintes
sipped
here
and
there
enjoying
the
inner
symphonies
succeeded
in
procuring
sensations
in
his
throat
analogous
to
those
which
music
gives
to
the
ear
moreover
each
liquor
corresponded
according
to
his
thinking
to
the
sound
of
some
instrument
dry
curacoa
for
example
to
the
clarinet
whose
tone
is
sourish
and
velvety
to
the
oboe
whose
sonorous
notes
snuffle
mint
and
anisette
to
the
flute
at
once
sugary
and
peppery
puling
and
sweet
while
to
complete
the
orchestra
has
the
furious
ring
of
the
trumpet
gin
and
whiskey
burn
the
palate
with
their
strident
crashings
of
trombones
and
cornets
brandy
storms
with
the
deafening
hubbub
of
tubas
while
the
of
the
cymbals
and
the
furiously
beaten
drum
roll
in
the
mouth
by
means
of
the
de
he
also
thought
that
the
comparison
could
be
continued
that
quartets
of
string
instruments
could
play
under
the
palate
with
the
violin
simulated
by
old
brandy
fumous
and
fine
piercing
and
frail
the
tenor
violin
by
rum
louder
and
more
sonorous
the
cello
by
the
lacerating
and
lingering
ratafia
melancholy
and
caressing
with
the
solid
and
dark
as
the
old
bitters
if
one
wished
to
form
a
quintet
one
could
even
add
a
fifth
instrument
with
the
vibrant
taste
the
silvery
detached
and
shrill
note
of
dry
cumin
imitating
the
harp
the
comparison
was
further
prolonged
tone
relationships
existed
in
the
music
of
liquors
to
cite
but
one
note
benedictine
represents
so
to
speak
the
minor
key
of
that
major
key
of
alcohols
which
are
designated
in
commercial
scores
under
the
name
of
green
chartreuse
these
principles
once
admitted
he
succeeded
after
numerous
experiments
in
enjoying
silent
melodies
on
his
tongue
mute
funeral
marches
in
hearing
in
his
mouth
solos
of
mint
duos
of
ratafia
and
rum
he
was
even
able
to
transfer
to
his
palate
real
pieces
of
music
following
the
composer
step
by
step
rendering
his
thought
his
effects
his
nuances
by
combinations
or
contrasts
of
liquors
by
approximative
and
skilled
mixtures
at
other
times
he
himself
composed
melodies
executed
pastorals
with
mild
which
evoked
in
his
throat
the
trillings
of
nightingales
with
the
tender
chouva
cocoa
which
sang
saccharine
songs
like
the
romance
of
estelle
and
the
ah
shall
i
tell
you
mama
of
past
days
but
on
this
evening
des
esseintes
was
not
inclined
to
listen
to
this
music
he
confined
himself
to
sounding
one
note
on
the
keyboard
of
his
organ
by
swallowing
a
little
glass
of
genuine
irish
whiskey
he
sank
into
his
easy
chair
and
slowly
inhaled
this
fermented
juice
of
oats
and
barley
a
pronounced
taste
of
creosote
was
in
his
mouth
gradually
as
he
drank
his
thought
followed
the
now
revived
sensitiveness
of
his
palate
fitted
its
progress
to
the
flavor
of
the
whiskey
by
a
fatal
exactitude
of
odors
memories
effaced
for
years
this
carbolic
tartness
forcibly
recalled
to
him
the
same
taste
he
had
had
on
his
tongue
in
the
days
when
dentists
worked
on
his
gums
once
abandoned
on
this
track
his
revery
at
first
dispersed
among
all
the
dentists
he
had
known
concentrated
and
converged
on
one
of
them
who
was
more
firmly
engraved
in
his
memory
it
had
happened
three
years
ago
seized
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
an
abominable
toothache
he
put
his
hand
to
his
cheek
stumbled
against
the
furniture
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
like
a
demented
person
it
was
a
molar
which
had
already
been
filled
no
remedy
was
possible
only
a
dentist
could
alleviate
the
pain
he
feverishly
waited
for
the
day
resolved
to
bear
the
most
atrocious
operation
provided
it
would
only
ease
his
sufferings
holding
a
hand
to
his
jaw
he
asked
himself
what
should
be
done
the
dentists
who
treated
him
were
rich
merchants
whom
one
could
not
see
at
any
time
one
had
to
make
an
appointment
he
told
himself
that
this
would
never
do
that
he
could
not
endure
it
he
decided
to
patronize
the
first
one
he
could
find
to
hasten
to
a
popular
one
of
those
men
who
if
they
are
ignorant
of
the
useless
art
of
dressing
decaying
teeth
and
of
filling
holes
know
how
to
pull
the
stubbornest
stump
with
an
unequalled
rapidity
there
the
office
is
opened
early
in
the
morning
and
one
is
not
required
to
wait
seven
struck
at
last
he
hurried
out
and
recollecting
the
name
of
a
mechanic
who
called
himself
a
dentist
and
dwelt
in
the
corner
of
a
quay
he
rushed
through
the
streets
holding
his
cheek
with
his
hands
repressing
the
tears
arrived
in
front
of
the
house
recognizable
by
an
immense
wooden
signboard
where
the
name
of
gatonax
sprawled
in
enormous
letters
and
by
two
little
glass
cases
where
false
teeth
were
carefully
set
in
wax
he
gasped
for
breath
he
perspired
profusely
a
horrible
fear
shook
him
a
trembling
crept
under
his
skin
suddenly
a
calm
ensued
the
suffering
ceased
the
tooth
stopped
paining
he
remained
stupefied
on
the
sidewalk
finally
he
stiffened
against
the
anguish
mounted
the
dim
stairway
running
up
four
steps
at
a
time
to
the
fourth
story
he
found
himself
in
front
of
a
door
where
an
enamel
plate
repeated
inscribed
in
lettering
the
name
on
the
signboard
he
rang
the
bell
and
then
terrified
by
the
great
red
spittles
which
he
noticed
on
the
steps
he
faced
about
resolved
to
endure
his
toothache
all
his
life
at
that
moment
an
excruciating
cry
pierced
the
partitions
filled
the
cage
of
the
doorway
and
glued
him
to
the
spot
with
horror
at
the
same
time
that
a
door
was
opened
and
an
old
woman
invited
him
to
enter
his
feeling
of
shame
quickly
changed
to
fear
he
was
ushered
into
a
dining
room
another
door
creaked
and
in
entered
a
terrible
grenadier
dressed
in
a
and
black
trousers
des
esseintes
followed
him
to
another
room
from
this
instant
his
sensations
were
confused
he
vaguely
remembered
having
sunk
into
a
chair
opposite
a
window
having
murmured
as
he
put
a
finger
to
his
tooth
it
has
already
been
filled
and
i
am
afraid
nothing
more
can
be
done
with
it
the
man
immediately
suppressed
these
explanations
by
introducing
an
enormous
index
finger
into
his
mouth
muttering
beneath
his
waxed
moustaches
he
took
an
instrument
from
the
table
then
the
play
began
clinging
to
the
arms
of
his
seat
des
esseintes
felt
a
cold
sensation
in
his
cheek
and
began
to
suffer
unheard
agonies
then
he
beheld
stars
he
stamped
his
feet
frantically
and
bleated
like
a
sheep
about
to
be
slaughtered
a
snapping
sound
was
heard
the
molar
had
broken
while
being
extracted
it
seemed
that
his
head
was
being
shattered
that
his
skull
was
being
smashed
he
lost
his
senses
howled
as
loudly
as
he
could
furiously
defending
himself
from
the
man
who
rushed
at
him
anew
as
if
he
wished
to
implant
his
whole
arm
in
the
depths
of
his
bowels
brusquely
recoiled
a
step
and
lifting
the
tooth
attached
to
the
jaw
brutally
let
him
fall
back
into
the
chair
breathing
heavily
his
form
filling
the
window
he
brandished
at
one
end
of
his
forceps
a
blue
tooth
with
blood
at
one
end
faint
and
prostrate
des
esseintes
spat
blood
into
a
basin
refused
with
a
gesture
the
tooth
which
the
old
woman
was
about
to
wrap
in
a
piece
of
paper
and
fled
after
paying
two
francs
expectorating
blood
in
his
turn
down
the
steps
he
at
length
found
himself
in
the
street
joyous
feeling
ten
years
younger
interested
in
every
little
occurrence
phew
he
exclaimed
saddened
by
the
assault
of
these
memories
he
rose
to
dissipate
the
horrible
spell
of
this
vision
and
returning
to
reality
began
to
be
concerned
with
the
tortoise
it
did
not
budge
at
all
and
he
tapped
it
the
animal
was
dead
doubtless
accustomed
to
a
sedentary
existence
to
a
humble
life
spent
underneath
its
poor
shell
it
had
been
unable
to
support
the
dazzling
luxury
imposed
on
it
the
rutilant
cope
with
which
it
had
been
covered
the
jewels
with
which
its
back
had
been
paved
like
a
pyx
chapter
with
the
sharpening
of
his
desire
to
withdraw
from
a
hated
age
he
felt
a
despotic
urge
to
shun
pictures
representing
humanity
striving
in
little
holes
or
running
to
and
fro
in
quest
of
money
with
his
growing
indifference
to
contemporary
life
he
had
resolved
not
to
introduce
into
his
cell
any
of
the
ghosts
of
distastes
or
regrets
but
had
desired
to
procure
subtle
and
exquisite
paintings
steeped
in
ancient
dreams
or
antique
corruptions
far
removed
from
the
manner
of
our
present
day
for
the
delight
of
his
spirit
and
the
joy
of
his
eyes
he
had
desired
a
few
suggestive
creations
that
cast
him
into
an
unknown
world
revealing
to
him
the
contours
of
new
conjectures
agitating
the
nervous
system
by
the
violent
deliriums
complicated
nightmares
nonchalant
or
atrocious
chimerae
they
induced
among
these
were
some
executed
by
an
artist
whose
genius
allured
and
entranced
him
gustave
moreau
des
esseintes
had
acquired
his
two
masterpieces
and
at
night
used
to
sink
into
revery
before
one
of
them
a
representation
of
salome
conceived
in
this
fashion
a
throne
resembling
the
high
altar
of
a
cathedral
reared
itself
beneath
innumerable
vaults
leaping
from
heavy
romanesque
pillars
studded
with
polychromatic
bricks
set
with
mosaics
incrusted
with
lapis
lazuli
and
sardonyx
in
a
palace
that
like
a
basilica
was
at
once
mohammedan
and
byzantine
in
design
in
the
center
of
the
tabernacle
surmounting
an
altar
approached
by
steps
sat
herod
the
tetrarch
a
tiara
upon
his
head
his
legs
pressed
closely
together
his
hands
resting
upon
his
knees
his
face
was
the
color
of
yellow
parchment
it
was
furrowed
with
wrinkles
ravaged
with
age
his
long
beard
floated
like
a
white
cloud
upon
the
clusters
of
jewels
constellating
the
orphrey
robe
fitting
tightly
over
his
breast
around
this
form
frozen
into
the
immobile
sacerdotal
hieratic
pose
of
a
hindoo
god
burned
perfumes
wafting
aloft
clouds
of
incense
which
were
perforated
like
phosphorescent
eyes
of
beasts
by
the
fiery
rays
of
the
stones
set
in
the
throne
then
the
vapor
rolled
up
diffusing
itself
beneath
arcades
where
the
blue
smoke
mingled
with
the
gold
powder
of
the
long
sunbeams
falling
from
the
domes
in
the
perverse
odor
of
the
perfumes
in
the
overheated
atmosphere
of
the
temple
salome
her
left
arm
outstretched
in
a
gesture
of
command
her
right
arm
drawn
back
and
holding
a
large
lotus
on
a
level
with
her
face
slowly
advances
on
her
toes
to
the
rhythm
of
a
stringed
instrument
played
by
a
woman
seated
on
the
ground
her
face
is
meditative
solemn
almost
august
as
she
commences
the
lascivious
dance
that
will
awaken
the
slumbering
senses
of
old
herod
diamonds
scintillate
against
her
glistening
skin
her
bracelets
her
girdles
her
rings
flash
on
her
triumphal
robe
seamed
with
pearls
flowered
with
silver
and
laminated
with
gold
the
breastplate
of
jewels
each
link
of
which
is
a
precious
stone
flashes
serpents
of
fire
against
the
pallid
flesh
delicate
as
a
its
jewels
like
splendid
insects
with
dazzling
elytra
veined
with
carmine
dotted
with
yellow
gold
diapered
with
blue
steel
speckled
with
peacock
green
with
a
tense
concentration
with
the
fixed
gaze
of
a
somnambulist
she
beholds
neither
the
trembling
tetrarch
nor
her
mother
the
fierce
herodias
who
watches
her
nor
the
hermaphrodite
nor
the
eunuch
who
sits
sword
in
hand
at
the
foot
of
the
throne
a
terrible
figure
veiled
to
his
eyes
whose
breasts
droop
like
gourds
under
his
tunic
this
conception
of
salome
so
haunting
to
artists
and
poets
had
obsessed
des
esseintes
for
years
how
often
had
he
read
in
the
old
bible
of
pierre
variquet
translated
by
the
theological
doctors
of
the
university
of
louvain
the
gospel
of
saint
matthew
who
in
brief
and
ingenuous
phrases
recounts
the
beheading
of
the
baptist
how
often
had
he
fallen
into
revery
as
he
read
these
lines
but
when
herod
birthday
was
kept
the
daughter
of
herodias
danced
before
them
and
pleased
herod
whereupon
he
promised
with
an
oath
to
give
her
whatsoever
she
would
ask
and
she
being
before
instructed
of
her
mother
said
give
me
here
john
head
in
a
charger
and
the
king
was
sorry
nevertheless
for
the
oath
sake
and
them
which
sat
with
him
at
meat
he
commanded
it
to
be
given
her
and
he
sent
and
beheaded
john
in
the
prison
and
his
head
was
brought
in
a
charger
and
given
to
the
damsel
and
she
brought
it
to
her
mother
but
neither
saint
matthew
nor
saint
mark
nor
saint
luke
nor
the
other
evangelists
had
emphasized
the
maddening
charms
and
depravities
of
the
dancer
she
remained
vague
and
hidden
mysterious
and
swooning
in
the
mist
of
the
centuries
not
to
be
grasped
by
vulgar
and
materialistic
minds
accessible
only
to
disordered
and
volcanic
intellects
made
visionaries
by
their
neuroticism
rebellious
to
painters
of
the
flesh
to
rubens
who
disguised
her
as
a
butcher
wife
of
flanders
a
mystery
to
all
the
writers
who
had
never
succeeded
in
portraying
the
disquieting
exaltation
of
this
dancer
the
refined
grandeur
of
this
murderess
in
gustave
moreau
work
conceived
independently
of
the
testament
themes
des
esseintes
as
last
saw
realized
the
superhuman
and
exotic
salome
of
his
dreams
she
was
no
longer
the
mere
performer
who
wrests
a
cry
of
desire
and
of
passion
from
an
old
man
by
a
perverted
twisting
of
her
loins
who
destroys
the
energy
and
breaks
the
will
of
a
king
by
trembling
breasts
and
quivering
belly
she
became
in
a
sense
the
symbolic
deity
of
indestructible
lust
the
goddess
of
immortal
hysteria
of
accursed
beauty
distinguished
from
all
others
by
the
catalepsy
which
stiffens
her
flesh
and
hardens
her
muscles
the
monstrous
beast
indifferent
irresponsible
insensible
baneful
like
the
helen
of
antiquity
fatal
to
all
who
approach
her
all
who
behold
her
all
whom
she
touches
thus
understood
she
was
associated
with
the
theogonies
of
the
far
east
she
no
longer
sprang
from
biblical
traditions
could
no
longer
even
be
assimilated
with
the
living
image
of
babylon
the
royal
prostitute
of
the
apocalypse
garbed
like
her
in
jewels
and
purple
and
painted
like
her
for
she
was
not
hurled
by
a
fatidical
power
by
a
supreme
force
into
the
alluring
vileness
of
debauchery
the
painter
moreover
seems
to
have
wished
to
affirm
his
desire
of
remaining
outside
the
centuries
scorning
to
designate
the
origin
nation
and
epoch
by
placing
his
salome
in
this
extraordinary
palace
with
its
confused
and
imposing
style
in
clothing
her
with
sumptuous
and
chimerical
robes
in
crowning
her
with
a
fantastic
mitre
shaped
like
a
phoenician
tower
such
as
salammbo
bore
and
placing
in
her
hand
the
sceptre
of
isis
the
tall
lotus
sacred
flower
of
egypt
and
india
des
esseintes
sought
the
sense
of
this
emblem
had
it
that
phallic
significance
which
the
primitive
cults
of
india
gave
it
did
it
enunciate
an
oblation
of
virginity
to
the
senile
herod
an
exchange
of
blood
an
impure
and
voluntary
wound
offered
under
the
express
stipulation
of
a
monstrous
sin
or
did
it
represent
the
allegory
of
fecundity
the
hindoo
myth
of
life
an
existence
held
between
the
hands
of
woman
distorted
and
trampled
by
the
palpitant
hands
of
man
whom
a
fit
of
madness
seizes
seduced
by
a
convulsion
of
the
flesh
perhaps
too
in
arming
his
enigmatic
goddess
with
the
venerated
lotus
the
painter
had
dreamed
of
the
dancer
the
mortal
woman
with
the
polluted
vase
from
whom
spring
all
sins
and
crimes
perhaps
he
had
recalled
the
rites
of
ancient
egypt
the
sepulchral
ceremonies
of
the
embalming
when
after
stretching
the
corpse
on
a
bench
of
jasper
extracting
the
brain
with
curved
needles
through
the
chambers
of
the
nose
the
chemists
and
the
priests
before
gilding
the
nails
and
teeth
and
coating
the
body
with
bitumens
and
essences
inserted
the
chaste
petals
of
the
divine
flower
in
the
sexual
parts
to
purify
them
however
this
may
be
an
irresistible
fascination
emanated
from
this
painting
but
the
entitled
was
perhaps
even
more
disturbing
there
the
palace
of
herod
arose
like
an
alhambra
on
slender
iridescent
columns
with
moorish
tile
joined
with
silver
beton
and
gold
cement
arabesques
proceeded
from
lozenges
of
lapis
lazuli
wove
their
patterns
on
the
cupolas
where
on
nacreous
marquetry
crept
rainbow
gleams
and
prismatic
flames
the
murder
was
accomplished
the
executioner
stood
impassive
his
hands
on
the
hilt
of
his
long
sword
the
severed
head
of
the
saint
stared
lividly
on
the
charger
resting
on
the
slabs
the
mouth
was
discolored
and
open
the
neck
crimson
and
tears
fell
from
the
eyes
the
face
was
encircled
by
an
aureole
worked
in
mosaic
which
shot
rays
of
light
under
the
porticos
and
illuminated
the
horrible
ascension
of
the
head
brightening
the
glassy
orbs
of
the
contracted
eyes
which
were
fixed
with
a
ghastly
stare
upon
the
dancer
with
a
gesture
of
terror
salome
thrusts
from
her
the
horrible
vision
which
transfixes
her
motionless
to
the
ground
her
eyes
dilate
her
hands
clasp
her
neck
in
a
convulsive
clutch
she
is
almost
nude
in
the
ardor
of
the
dance
her
veils
had
become
loosened
she
is
garbed
only
in
stuffs
and
limpid
stones
a
clasps
her
as
a
corselet
does
the
body
and
like
a
superb
buckle
a
marvelous
jewel
sparkles
on
the
hollow
between
her
breasts
a
girdle
encircles
her
hips
concealing
the
upper
part
of
her
thighs
against
which
beats
a
gigantic
pendant
streaming
with
carbuncles
and
emeralds
all
the
facets
of
the
jewels
kindle
under
the
ardent
shafts
of
light
escaping
from
the
head
of
the
baptist
the
stones
grow
warm
outlining
the
woman
body
with
incandescent
rays
striking
her
neck
feet
and
arms
with
tongues
of
fire
vermilions
like
coals
violets
like
jets
of
gas
blues
like
flames
of
alcohol
and
whites
like
star
light
the
horrible
head
blazes
bleeding
constantly
clots
of
sombre
purple
on
the
ends
of
the
beard
and
hair
visible
for
salome
alone
it
does
not
with
its
fixed
gaze
attract
herodias
musing
on
her
finally
consummated
revenge
nor
the
tetrarch
who
bent
slightly
forward
his
hands
on
his
knees
still
pants
maddened
by
the
nudity
of
the
woman
saturated
with
animal
odors
steeped
in
balms
exuding
incense
and
myrrh
like
the
old
king
des
esseintes
remained
dumbfounded
overwhelmed
and
seized
with
giddiness
in
the
presence
of
this
dancer
who
was
less
majestic
less
haughty
but
more
disquieting
than
the
salome
of
the
oil
painting
in
this
insensate
and
pitiless
image
in
this
innocent
and
dangerous
idol
the
eroticism
and
terror
of
mankind
were
depicted
the
tall
lotus
had
disappeared
the
goddess
had
vanished
a
frightful
nightmare
now
stifled
the
woman
dizzied
by
the
whirlwind
of
the
dance
hypnotized
and
petrified
by
terror
it
was
here
that
she
was
indeed
woman
for
here
she
gave
rein
to
her
ardent
and
cruel
temperament
she
was
living
more
refined
and
savage
more
execrable
and
exquisite
she
more
energetically
awakened
the
dulled
senses
of
man
more
surely
bewitched
and
subdued
his
power
of
will
with
the
charm
of
a
tall
venereal
flower
cultivated
in
sacrilegious
beds
in
impious
hothouses
des

thought
that
never
before
had
a
water
color
attained
such
magnificent
coloring
never
before
had
the
poverty
of
colors
been
able
to
force
jeweled
corruscations
from
paper
gleams
like
stained
glass
windows
touched
by
rays
of
sunlight
splendors
of
tissue
and
flesh
so
fabulous
and
dazzling
lost
in
contemplation
he
sought
to
discover
the
origins
of
this
great
artist
and
mystic
pagan
this
visionary
who
succeeded
in
removing
himself
from
the
world
sufficiently
to
behold
here
in
paris
the
splendor
of
these
cruel
visions
and
the
enchanting
sublimation
of
past
ages
des
esseintes
could
not
trace
the
genesis
of
this
artist
here
and
there
were
vague
suggestions
of
mantegna
and
of
jacopo
de
barbari
here
and
there
were
confused
hints
of
vinci
and
of
the
feverish
colors
of
delacroix
but
the
influences
of
such
masters
remained
negligible
the
fact
was
that
gustave
moreau
derived
from
no
one
else
he
remained
unique
in
contemporary
art
without
ancestors
and
without
possible
descendants
he
went
to
ethnographic
sources
to
the
origins
of
myths
and
he
compared
and
elucidated
their
intricate
enigmas
he
reunited
the
legends
of
the
far
east
into
a
whole
the
myths
which
had
been
altered
by
the
superstitions
of
other
peoples
thus
justifying
his
architectonic
fusions
his
luxurious
and
outlandish
fabrics
his
hieratic
and
sinister
allegories
sharpened
by
the
restless
perceptions
of
a
pruriently
modern
neurosis
and
he
remained
saddened
haunted
by
the
symbols
of
perversities
and
superhuman
loves
of
divine
stuprations
brought
to
end
without
abandonment
and
without
hope
his
depressing
and
erudite
productions
possessed
a
strange
enchantment
an
incantation
that
stirred
one
to
the
depths
just
as
do
certain
poems
of
baudelaire
caused
one
to
pause
disconcerted
amazed
brooding
on
the
spell
of
an
art
which
leaped
beyond
the
confines
of
painting
borrowing
its
most
subtle
effects
from
the
art
of
writing
its
most
marvelous
stokes
from
the
art
of
limosin
its
most
exquisite
refinements
from
the
art
of
the
lapidary
and
the
engraver
these
two
pictures
of
salome
for
which
des
esseintes
admiration
was
boundless
he
had
hung
on
the
walls
of
his
study
on
special
panels
between
the
bookshelves
so
that
they
might
live
under
his
eyes
but
these
were
not
the
only
pictures
he
had
acquired
to
divert
his
solitude
although
he
had
surrendered
to
his
servants
the
second
story
of
his
house
which
he
himself
never
used
at
all
the
ground
floor
had
required
a
number
of
pictures
to
fit
the
walls
it
was
thus
arranged
a
dressing
room
communicating
with
the

occupied
one
of
the
corners
of
the
house
one
passed
from
the
bedroom
to
the
library
and
from
the
library
into
the
dining
room
which
formed
the
other
corner
these
rooms
whose
windows
looked
out
on
the
aunay
valley
composed
one
of
the
sides
of
the
dwelling
the
other
side
of
the
house
had
four
rooms
arranged
in
the
same
order
thus
the
kitchen
formed
an
angle
and
corresponded
with
the
dining
room
a
long
corridor
which
served
as
the
entrance
with
the
library
a
small
dressing
room
with
the
bedroom
and
the
toilet
forming
a
second
angle
with
the

these
rooms
received
the
light
from
the
side
opposite
the
aunay

and
faced
the
towers
of

as
for

it
was
built
outside

of

old
dutch
engraver
almost
unknown
in

he
possessed
of
the
work
of
this
artist
who
was
fantastic
and
melancholy
vehement
and
wild
the
series
of
his
horrible
prints
depicting
all
the
agonies
invented
by
the
madness
of
religions
prints
pregnant
with
human
sufferings
showing
bodies
roasting
on
fires
skulls

dislocated
and
deliberately
broken
and

bared
of

and
agonizingly
scraped
by
sheets
of

these
works
filled
with
abominable
imaginings
offensive
with
their
odors
of
burning
oozing
with
blood
and
clamorous
with
cries
of
horror
and
maledictions
gave

in

the
creeping
sensations

occasioned
beyond
the
terrible

of
this
man
the
extraordinary

which
animates
his
characters
one
discovered
among
his
astonishing
swarming
throngs
among
his

of
people
delineated
with
a
dexterity
which
recalled

which

a
strength
never
possessed
by
that
amusing

were
studied
with
a
meticulous
care
and
noted
with
scientific
accuracy
these

were
veritable
treasures
of

one
could
gaze
at

for
hours
without

any

by

the
hallucination
of

a
fervent
calvinist
a
stubborn
sectarian
unbalanced
by
prayers
and
hymns
he
wrote
religious
poetry
which
he
illustrated
paraphrased
the
psalms
in
verse
lost
himself
in
the
reading
of
the
bible
from
which
he
emerged
haggard
and
frenzied
his
brain
haunted
by
monstrous
subjects
his
mouth
twisted
by
the
maledictions
of
the
reformation
and
by
its
songs
of
terror
and
hate
and
he
scorned
the
world
surrendering
his
wealth
to
the
poor
and
subsisting
on
a
slice
of
bread
he
ended
his
life
in
travelling
with
an
equally
fanatical

and

engraving

an
incongruous
medley
of
palms

and
oaks
grown
together
heedless
of

and
climates
peopled
with
monkeys
and
owls
covered
with
old
stumps
as
misshapen
as
the
roots
of

dotted

with
masses
of
fleecy
clouds
it
could
be
called
the
design
of
an
uncertain
primitive

with
an
brain
but
although
he
liked
the
finesse
of
the
detail
and
the
imposing
appearance
of
this
print
des

had
a
special
weakness
for
the
other
frames
adorning
the
room
they
were
signed
odilon
redon
they
enclosed
inconceivable
apparitions
in
their
rough
wood
a
head
of
a
merovingian
style
resting
against
a
bowl
a
bearded
man
at
once
resembling
a
buddhist
priest
and
an
orator
at
a
public
reunion
touching
the
ball
of
a
gigantic
cannon
with
his
fingers
a
frightful
spider
revealing
a
human
face
in

the

went
even
farther
into

terrors

an
enormous

in

a
sad
eye
winked
there
dry
and
arid
landscapes
dusty
plains
shifting
ground
volcanic
upheavals
catching
rebellious
clouds
stagnant
and
livid
skies
sometimes
the
subjects
even
seemed
to
have
borrowed
from
the
cacodemons
of
science
reverting
to
prehistoric
times
a
monstrous
plant
on
the
rocks
queer
blocks
everywhere
glacial
mud
figures
whose
simian
shapes
heavy
jaws
beetling
eyebrows
retreating
foreheads
and
flat
skulls
recalled
the
ancestral
heads
of
the
first
quaternary
periods
when
inarticulate
man
still
devoured
fruits
and
seeds
and
was
still
contemporaneous
with
the
mammoth
the
rhinoceros
and
the
big
bear
these
designs
were
beyond
anything
imaginable
they
leaped
for
the
most
part
beyond
the
limits
of
painting
and
introduced
a
fantasy
that
was
unique
the
fantasy
of
a
diseased
and
delirious
mind
and
indeed
certain
of
these
faces
with
their
monstrous
insane
eyes
certain
of
these
swollen
deformed
bodies
resembling
carafes
induced
in
des
esseintes
recollections
of
typhoid
memories
of
feverish
nights
and
of
the
shocking
visions
of
his
infancy
which
persisted
and
would
not
be
suppressed
seized
with
an
indefinable
uneasiness
in
the
presence
of
these
sketches
the
same
sensation
caused
by
certain
of
goya
which
they
recalled
or
by
the
reading
of
edgar
allen
poe
tales
whose
mirages
of
hallucination
and
effects
of
fear
odilon
redon
seemed
to
have
transposed
to
a
different
art
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
turned
to
contemplate
a
radiant
figure
which
amid
these
tormenting
sketches
arose
serene
and
calm
a
figure
of
melancholy
seated
near
the
disk
of
a
sun
on
the
rocks
in
a
dejected
and
gloomy
posture
the
shadows
were
dispersed
as
though
by
an
enchantment
a
charming
sadness
a
languid
and
desolate
feeling
flowed
through
him
he
meditated
long
before
this
work
which
with
its
dashes
of
paint
flecking
the
thick
crayon
spread
a
brilliance
of
and
of
pale
gold
among
the
protracted
darkness
of
the
charcoal
prints
in
addition
to
this
series
of
the
works
of
redon
which
adorned
nearly
every
panel
of
the
passage
he
had
hung
a
disturbing
sketch
by
el
greco
in
his
bedroom
it
was
a
christ
done
in
strange
tints
in
a
strained
design
possessing
a
wild
color
and
a
disordered
energy
a
picture
executed
in
the
painter
second
manner
when
he
had
been
tormented
by
the
necessity
of
avoiding
imitation
of
titian
this
sinister
painting
with
its
wax
and
sickly
green
tones
bore
an
affinity
to
certain
ideas
des
esseintes
had
with
regard
to
furnishing
a
room
according
to
him
there
were
but
two
ways
of
fitting
a
bedroom
one
could
either
make
it
a
alcove
a
place
for
nocturnal
delights
or
a
cell
for
solitude
and
repose
a
retreat
for
thought
a
sort
of
oratory
for
the
first
instance
the
louis
xv
style
was
inevitable
for
the
fastidious
for
the
cerebrally
morbid
only
the
eighteenth
century
had
succeeded
in
enveloping
woman
with
a
vicious
atmosphere
imitating
her
contours
in
the
undulations
and
twistings
of
wood
and
copper
accentuating
the
sugary
languor
of
the
blond
with
its
clear
and
lively
attenuating
the
pungency
of
the
brunette
with
its
tapestries
of
aqueous
sweet
almost
insipid
tones
he
had
once
had
such
a
room
in
paris
with
a
lofty
white
lacquered
bed
which
is
one
stimulant
the
more
a
source
of
depravity
to
old
roues
leering
at
the
false
chastity
and
hypocritical
modesty
of
greuze
tender
virgins
at
the
deceptive
candor
of
a
bed
evocative
of
babes
and
chaste
maidens
for
the
second
instance
and
now
that
he
wished
to
put
behind
him
the
irritating
memories
of
his
past
life
this
was
the
only
possible
expedient
he
was
compelled
to
design
a
room
that
would
be
like
a
monastic
cell
but
difficulties
faced
him
here
for
he
refused
to
accept
in
its
entirety
the
austere
ugliness
of
those
asylums
of
penitence
and
prayer
by
dint
of
studying
the
problem
in
all
its
phases
he
concluded
that
the
end
to
be
attained
could
thus
be
stated
to
devise
a
sombre
effect
by
means
of
cheerful
objects
or
rather
to
give
a
tone
of
elegance
and
distinction
to
the
room
thus
treated
meanwhile
preserving
its
character
of
ugliness
to
reverse
the
practice
of
the
theatre
whose
vile
tinsel
imitates
sumptuous
and
costly
textures
to
obtain
the
contrary
effect
by
use
of
splendid
fabrics
in
a
word
to
have
the
cell
of
a
carthusian
monk
which
should
possess
the
appearance
of
reality
without
in
fact
being
so
thus
he
proceeded
to
imitate
the
of
ochre
and
clerical
yellow
he
had
his
walls
covered
with
saffron
silk
to
stimulate
the
chocolate
hue
of
the
dadoes
common
to
this
type
of
room
he
used
pieces
of
violet
wood
deepened
with
amarinth
the
effect
was
bewitching
while
recalling
to
des
esseintes
the
repellant
rigidity
of
the
model
he
had
followed
and
yet
transformed
the
ceiling
in
turn
was
hung
with
white
unbleached
cloth
in
imitation
of
plaster
but
without
its
discordant
brightness
as
for
the
cold
pavement
of
the
cell
he
was
able
to
copy
it
by
means
of
a
bit
of
rug
designed
in
red
squares
with
whitish
spots
in
the
weave
to
imitate
the
wear
of
sandals
and
the
friction
of
boots
into
this
chamber
he
introduced
a
small
iron
bed
the
kind
used
by
monks
fashioned
of
antique
forged
and
polished
iron
the
head
and
foot
adorned
with
thick
filigrees
of
blossoming
tulips
enlaced
with
vine
branches
and
leaves
once
this
had
been
part
of
a
balustrade
of
an
old
hostel
superb
staircase
for
his
table
he
installed
an
antique
the
inside
of
which
could
contain
an
urn
and
the
outside
a
prayer
book
against
the
wall
opposite
it
he
placed
a
church
pew
surmounted
by
a
tall
dais
with
little
benches
carved
out
of
solid
wood
his
church
tapers
were
made
of
real
wax
procured
from
a
special
house
which
catered
exclusively
to
houses
of
worship
for
des
esseintes
professed
a
sincere
repugnance
to
gas
oil
and
ordinary
candles
to
all
modern
forms
of
illumination
so
gaudy
and
brutal
before
going
to
sleep
in
the
morning
he
would
gaze
with
his
head
on
the
pillows
at
his
el
greco
whose
barbaric
color
rebuked
the
smiling
yellow
material
and
recalled
it
to
a
more
serious
tone
then
he
could
easily
imagine
himself
living
a
hundred
leagues
removed
from
paris
far
from
society
in
cloistral
security
and
all
in
all
the
illusion
was
not
difficult
since
he
led
an
existence
that
approached
the
life
of
a
monk
thus
he
had
the
advantages
of
monasticism
without
the
inconveniences
of
its
vigorous
discipline
its
lack
of
service
its
dirt
its
promiscuity
and
its
monotonous
idleness
just
as
he
had
transformed
his
cell
into
a
comfortable
chamber
so
had
he
made
his
life
normal
pleasant
surrounded
by
comforts
occupied
and
free
like
a
hermit
he
was
ripe
for
isolation
since
life
harassed
him
and
he
no
longer
desired
anything
of
it
again
like
a
monk
he
was
depressed
and
in
the
grip
of
an
obsessing
lassitude
seized
with
the
need
of
and
with
a
desire
to
have
nothing
in
common
with
the
profane
who
were
for
him
the
utilitarian
and
the
imbecile
although
he
experienced
no
inclination
for
the
state
of
grace
he
felt
a
genuine
sympathy
for
those
souls
immured
in
monasteries
persecuted
by
a
vengeful
society
which
can
forgive
neither
the
merited
scorn
with
which
it
inspires
them
nor
the
desire
to
expiate
to
atone
by
long
silences
for
the
ever
growing
shamelessness
of
its
ridiculous
or
trifling
gossipings
chapter
ever
since
the
night
when
he
had
evoked
for
no
apparent
reason
a
whole
train
of
melancholy
memories
pictures
of
his
past
life
returned
to
des
esseintes
and
gave
him
no
peace
he
found
himself
unable
to
understand
a
single
word
of
the
books
he
read
he
could
not
even
receive
impressions
through
his
eyes
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
mind
saturated
with
literature
and
art
refused
to
absorb
any
more
he
lived
within
himself
nourished
by
his
own
substance
like
some
torpid
creature
which
hibernates
in
caves
solitude
had
reacted
upon
his
brain
like
a
narcotic
after
having
strained
and
enervated
it
his
mind
had
fallen
victim
to
a
sluggishness
which
annihilated
his
plans
broke
his
will
power
and
invoked
a
cortege
of
vague
reveries
to
which
he
passively
submitted
the
confused
medley
of
meditations
on
art
and
literature
in
which
he
had
indulged
since
his
isolation
as
a
dam
to
bar
the
current
of
old
memories
had
been
rudely
swept
away
and
the
onrushing
irresistible
wave
crashed
into
the
present
and
future
submerging
everything
beneath
the
blanket
of
the
past
filling
his
mind
with
an
immensity
of
sorrow
on
whose
surface
floated
like
futile
wreckage
absurd
trifles
and
dull
episodes
of
his
life
the
book
he
held
in
his
hands
fell
to
his
knees
he
abandoned
himself
to
the
mood
which
dominated
him
watching
the
dead
years
of
his
life
filled
with
so
many
disgusts
and
fears
move
past
what
a
life
he
had
lived
he
thought
of
the
evenings
spent
in
society
the
horse
races
card
parties
love
affairs
ordered
in
advance
and
served
at
the
stroke
of
midnight
in
his
boudoir
he
recalled
faces
expressions
vain
words
which
obsessed
him
with
the
stubbornness
of
popular
melodies
which
one
can
not
help
humming
but
which
suddenly
and
inexplicably
end
by
boring
one
this
phase
had
not
lasted
long
his
memory
gave
him
respite
and
he
plunged
again
into
his
latin
studies
so
as
to
efface
the
impressions
of
such
recollections
but
almost
instantly
the
rushing
force
of
his
memories
swept
him
into
a
second
phase
that
of
his
childhood
especially
of
the
years
spent
at
the
school
of
the
fathers
although
more
remote
they
were
more
positive
and
more
indelibly
stamped
on
his
brain
the
leafy
park
the
long
walks
the
flower
beds
the
benches
all
the
actual
details
of
the
monastery
rose
before
him
here
in
his
room
the
gardens
filled
and
he
heard
the
ringing
cries
of
the
students
mingling
with
the
laughter
of
the
professors
as
they
played
tennis
with
their
cassocks
tucked
up
between
their
knees
or
perhaps
chatted
under
the
trees
with
the
youngsters
without
any
posturing
or
hauteur
as
though
they
were
companions
of
the
same
age
he
recalled
the
easy
yoke
of
the
monks
who
declined
to
administer
punishment
by
inflicting
the
committment
of
five
hundred
or
a
thousand
lines
while
the
others
were
at
play
being
satisfied
with
making
those
delinquents
prepare
the
lesson
that
had
not
been
mastered
and
most
often
simply
having
recourse
to
a
gentle
admonition
they
surrounded
the
children
with
an
active
but
gentle
watch
seeking
to
please
them
consenting
to
whatever
expeditions
they
wished
to
take
on
tuesdays
taking
the
occasion
of
every
minor
holiday
not
formally
observed
by
the
church
to
add
cakes
and
wine
to
the
ordinary
fare
and
to
entertain
them
with
picnics
it
was
a
paternal
discipline
whose
success
lay
in
the
fact
that
they
did
not
seek
to
domineer
over
the
pupils
that
they
gossiped
with
them
treating
them
as
men
while
showering
them
with
the
attentions
paid
a
spoiled
child
in
this
manner
the
monks
succeeded
in
assuming
a
real
influence
over
the
youngsters
in
molding
to
some
extent
the
minds
which
they
were
cultivating
in
directing
them
in
a
sense
in
instilling
special
ideas
in
assuring
the
growth
of
their
thoughts
by
insinuating
wheedling
methods
with
which
they
continued
to
flatter
them
throughout
their
careers
taking
pains
not
to
lose
sight
of
them
in
their
later
life
and
by
sending
them
affectionate
letters
like
those
which
the
dominican
lacordaire
so
skillfully
wrote
to
his
former
pupils
of
sorreze
des
esseintes
took
note
of
this
system
which
had
been
so
fruitlessly
expended
on
him
his
stubborn
captious
and
inquisitive
character
disposed
to
controversies
had
prevented
him
from
being
modelled
by
their
discipline
or
subdued
by
their
lessons
his
scepticism
had
increased
after
he
left
the
precincts
of
the
college
his
association
with
a
legitimist
intolerant
and
shallow
society
his
conversations
with
unintelligent
church
wardens
and
abbots
whose
blunders
tore
away
the
veil
so
subtly
woven
by
the
jesuits
had
still
more
fortified
his
spirit
of
independence
and
increased
his
scorn
for
any
faith
whatever
he
had
deemed
himself
free
of
all
bonds
and
constraints
unlike
most
graduates
of
or
private
schools
he
had
preserved
a
vivid
memory
of
his
college
and
of
his
masters
and
now
as
he
considered
these
matters
he
asked
himself
if
the
seeds
sown
until
now
on
barren
soil
were
not
beginning
to
take
root
for
several
days
in
fact
his
soul
had
been
strangely
perturbed
at
moments
he
felt
himself
veering
towards
religion
then
at
the
slightest
approach
of
reason
his
faith
would
dissolve
yet
he
remained
deeply
troubled
analyzing
himself
he
was
well
aware
that
he
would
never
possess
a
truly
christian
spirit
of
humility
and
penitence
he
knew
without
a
doubt
that
he
would
never
experience
that
moment
of
grace
mentioned
by
lacordaire
when
the
last
shaft
of
light
penetrates
the
soul
and
unites
the
truths
there
lying
dispersed
he
never
felt
the
need
of
mortification
and
of
prayer
without
which
no
conversion
in
possible
if
one
is
to
believe
the
majority
of
priests
he
had
no
desire
to
implore
a
god
whose
forgiveness
seemed
most
improbable
yet
the
sympathy
he
felt
for
his
old
teachers
lent
him
an
interest
in
their
works
and
doctrines
those
inimitable
accents
of
conviction
those
ardent
voices
of
men
of
indubitably
superior
intelligence
returned
to
him
and
led
him
to
doubt
his
own
mind
and
strength
amid
the
solitude
in
which
he
lived
without
new
nourishment
without
any
fresh
experiences
without
any
renovation
of
thought
without
that
exchange
of
sensations
common
to
society
in
this
unnatural
confinement
in
which
he
persisted
all
the
questionings
forgotten
during
his
stay
in
paris
were
revived
as
active
irritants
the
reading
of
his
beloved
latin
works
almost
all
of
them
written
by
bishops
and
monks
had
doubtless
contributed
to
this
crisis
enveloped
in
a
atmosphere
in
a
heady
perfume
of
incense
his
nervous
brain
had
grown
excitable
and
by
an
association
of
ideas
these
books
had
driven
back
the
memories
of
his
life
as
a
young
man
revealing
in
full
light
the
years
spent
with
the
fathers
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
des
esseintes
mused
as
he
reasoned
the
matter
and
followed
the
progress
of
this
introduction
of
the
jesuitic
spirit
into
fontenay
since
my
childhood
although
unaware
of
it
i
have
had
this
leaven
which
has
never
fermented
the
weakness
i
have
always
borne
for
religious
subjects
is
perhaps
a
positive
proof
of
it
but
he
sought
to
persuade
himself
to
the
contrary
disturbed
at
no
longer
being
his
own
master
he
searched
for
motives
it
had
required
a
struggle
for
him
to
abandon
things
sacerdotal
since
the
church
alone
had
treasured
objects
of
art
the
lost
forms
of
past
ages
even
in
its
wretched
modern
reproductions
she
had
preserved
the
contours
of
the
gold
and
silver
ornaments
the
charm
of
chalices
curving
like
petunias
and
the
charm
of
pyxes
with
their
chaste
sides
even
in
aluminum
and
imitation
enamels
and
colored
glasses
she
had
preserved
the
grace
of
vanished
modes
in
short
most
of
the
precious
objects
now
to
be
found
in
the
cluny
museum
which
have
miraculously
escaped
the
crude
barbarism
of
the
philistines
come
from
the
ancient
french
abbeys
and
just
as
the
church
had
preserved
philosophy
and
history
and
letters
from
barbarism
in
the
middle
ages
so
had
she
saved
the
plastic
arts
bringing
to
our
own
days
those
marvelous
fabrics
and
jewelries
which
the
makers
of
sacred
objects
spoil
to
the
best
of
their
ability
without
being
able
to
destroy
the
originally
exquisite
form
it
followed
then
that
there
was
nothing
surprising
in
his
having
bought
these
old
trinkets
in
his
having
together
with
a
number
of
other
collectors
purchased
such
relics
from
the
antique
shops
of
paris
and
the
dealers
of
the
provinces
but
these
reasons
he
evoked
in
vain
he
did
not
wholly
succeed
in
convincing
himself
he
persisted
in
considering
religion
as
a
superb
legend
a
magnificent
imposture
yet
despite
his
convictions
his
scepticism
began
to
be
shattered
this
was
the
singular
fact
he
was
obliged
to
face
he
was
less
confident
now
than
in
childhood
when
he
had
been
directly
under
the
influence
of
the
jesuits
when
their
instruction
could
not
be
shunned
when
he
was
in
their
hands
and
belonged
to
them
body
and
soul
without
family
ties
with
no
outside
influence
powerful
enough
to
counteract
their
precepts
moreover
they
had
inculcated
in
him
a
certain
tendency
towards
the
marvelous
which
interned
and
exercised
in
the
close
quarters
of
his
fixed
ideas
had
slowly
and
obscurely
developed
in
his
soul
until
today
it
was
blossoming
in
his
solitude
affecting
his
spirit
regardless
of
arguments
by
examining
the
process
of
his
reasoning
by
seeking
to
unite
its
threads
and
to
discover
its
sources
and
causes
he
concluded
that
his
previous
mode
of
living
was
derived
from
the
education
he
had
received
thus
his
tendencies
towards
artificiality
and
his
craving
for
eccentricity
were
no
more
than
the
results
of
specious
studies
spiritual
refinements
and
speculations
they
were
in
the
last
analysis
ecstacies
aspirations
towards
an
ideal
towards
an
unknown
universe
as
desirable
as
that
promised
us
by
the
holy
scriptures
he
curbed
his
thoughts
sharply
and
broke
the
thread
of
his
reflections
well
he
thought
vexed
i
am
even
more
affected
than
i
had
imagined
here
am
i
arguing
with
myself
like
a
very
casuist
he
was
left
pensive
agitated
by
a
vague
fear
certainly
if
lacordaire
theory
were
sound
he
had
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
since
the
magic
touch
of
conversion
is
not
to
be
consummated
in
a
moment
to
bring
about
the
explosion
the
ground
must
be
constantly
and
assiduously
mined
but
just
as
the
romancers
speak
of
the
thunderclap
of
love
so
do
theologians
also
speak
of
the
thunderclap
of
conversion
no
one
was
safe
should
one
admit
the
truth
of
this
doctrine
there
was
no
longer
any
need
of
of
paying
heed
to
presentiments
of
taking
preventive
measures
the
psychology
of
mysticism
was
void
things
were
so
because
they
were
so
and
that
was
all
i
am
really
becoming
stupid
thought
des
esseintes
the
very
fear
of
this
malady
will
end
by
bringing
it
on
if
this
continues
he
partially
succeeded
in
shaking
off
this
influence
the
memories
of
his
life
with
the
jesuits
waned
only
to
be
replaced
by
other
thoughts
he
was
entirely
dominated
by
morbid
abstractions
despite
himself
he
thought
of
the
contradictory
interpretations
of
the
dogmas
of
the
lost
apostasies
of
father
labbe
recorded
in
the
works
on
the
decrees
fragments
of
these
schisms
scraps
of
these
heresies
which
for
centuries
had
divided
the
churches
of
the
orient
and
the
occident
returned
to
him
here
nestorius
denied
the
title
of
mother
of
god
to
the
virgin
because
in
the
mystery
of
the
incarnation
it
was
not
god
but
rather
a
human
being
she
had
nourished
in
her
womb
there
eutyches
declared
that
christ
image
could
not
resemble
that
of
other
men
since
divinity
had
chosen
to
dwell
in
his
body
and
had
consequently
entirely
altered
the
form
of
everything
other
quibblers
maintained
that
the
redeemer
had
had
no
body
at
all
and
that
this
expression
of
the
holy
books
must
be
taken
figuratively
while
tertullian
put
forth
his
famous
axiom
only
that
which
is
not
has
no
body
everything
which
is
has
a
body
fitting
it
finally
this
ancient
question
debated
for
years
demanded
an
answer
was
christ
hanged
on
the
cross
or
was
it
the
trinity
which
had
suffered
as
one
in
its
triple
hypostasis
on
the
cross
at
calvary
and
mechanically
like
a
lesson
long
ago
learned
he
proposed
the
questions
to
himself
and
answered
them
for
several
days
his
brain
was
a
swarm
of
paradoxes
subtleties
and
a
skein
of
rules
as
complicated
as
the
articles
of
the
codes
that
involved
the
sense
of
everything
indulged
in
puns
and
ended
in
a
most
tenuous
and
singular
celestial
jurisprudence
the
abstract
side
vanished
in
its
turn
and
under
the
influence
of
the
gustave
moreau
paintings
of
the
wall
yielded
to
a
concrete
succession
of
pictures
before
him
he
saw
marching
a
procession
of
prelates
the
archimandrites
and
patriarchs
their
white
beards
waving
during
the
reading
of
the
prayers
lifted
golden
arms
to
bless
kneeling
throngs
he
saw
silent
files
of
penitents
marching
into
dim
crypts
before
him
rose
vast
cathedrals
where
white
monks
intoned
from
pulpits
just
as
de
quincey
having
taken
a
dose
of
opium
and
uttered
the
word
consul
romanus
evoked
entire
pages
of
livius
and
beheld
the
solemn
advance
of
the
consuls
and
the
magnificent
pompous
march
of
the
roman
armies
so
he
at
a
theological
expression
paused
breathless
as
he
viewed
the
onrush
of
penitents
and
the
churchly
apparitions
which
detached
themselves
from
the
glowing
depths
of
the
basilica
these
scenes
held
him
enchanted
they
moved
from
age
to
age
culminating
in
the
modern
religious
ceremonies
bathing
his
soul
in
a
tender
mournful
infinity
of
music
on
this
plane
no
reasonings
were
necessary
there
were
no
further
contests
to
be
endured
he
had
an
indescribable
impression
of
respect
and
fear
his
artistic
sense
was
conquered
by
the
skillfully
calculated
catholic
rituals
his
nerves
quivered
at
these
memories
then
in
sudden
rebellion
in
a
sudden
reversion
monstrous
ideas
were
born
in
him
fancies
concerning
those
sacrileges
warned
against
by
the
manual
of
the
father
confessors
of
the
scandalous
impure
desecration
of
holy
water
and
sacred
oil
the
demon
a
powerful
rival
now
stood
against
an
omnipotent
god
a
frightful
grandeur
seemed
to
des
esseintes
to
emanate
from
a
crime
committed
in
church
by
a
believer
bent
with
blasphemously
horrible
glee
and
sadistic
joy
over
such
revered
objects
covering
them
with
outrages
and
saturating
them
in
opprobrium
before
him
were
conjured
up
the
madnesses
of
magic
of
the
black
mass
of
the
witches
revels
of
terrors
of
possessions
and
of
exorcisms
he
reached
the
point
where
he
wondered
if
he
were
not
committing
a
sacrilege
in
possessing
objects
which
had
once
been
consecrated
the
church
canons
chasubles
and
pyx
covers
and
this
idea
of
a
state
of
sin
imparted
to
him
a
mixed
sensation
of
pride
and
relief
the
pleasures
of
sacrilege
were
unravelled
from
the
skein
of
this
idea
but
these
were
debatable
sacrileges
in
any
case
and
hardly
serious
since
he
really
loved
these
objects
and
did
not
pollute
them
by
misuse
in
this
wise
he
lulled
himself
with
prudent
and
cowardly
thoughts
the
caution
of
his
soul
forbidding
obvious
crimes
and
depriving
him
of
the
courage
necessary
to
the
consummation
of
frightful
and
deliberate
sins
little
by
little
this
tendency
to
ineffectual
quibbling
disappeared
in
his
mind
eye
he
saw
the
panorama
of
the
church
with
its
hereditary
influence
on
humanity
through
the
centuries
he
imagined
it
as
imposing
and
suffering
emphasizing
to
man
the
horror
of
life
the
infelicity
of
man
destiny
preaching
patience
penitence
and
the
spirit
of
sacrifice
seeking
to
heal
wounds
while
it
displayed
the
bleeding
wounds
of
christ
bespeaking
divine
privileges
promising
the
richest
part
of
paradise
to
the
afflicted
exhorting
humanity
to
suffer
and
to
render
to
god
like
a
holocaust
its
trials
and
offenses
its
vicissitudes
and
pains
thus
the
church
grew
truly
eloquent
the
beneficent
mother
of
the
oppressed
the
eternal
menace
of
oppressors
and
despots
here
des
esseintes
was
on
firm
ground
he
was
thoroughly
satisfied
with
this
admission
of
social
ordure
but
he
revolted
against
the
vague
hope
of
remedy
in
the
beyond
schopenhauer
was
more
true
his
doctrine
and
that
of
the
church
started
from
common
premises
he
too
based
his
system
on
the
vileness
of
the
world
he
too
like
the
author
of
the
of
uttered
that
grievous
outcry
truly
life
on
earth
is
wretched
he
also
preached
the
nothingness
of
life
the
advantages
of
solitude
and
warned
humanity
that
no
matter
what
it
does
in
whatever
direction
it
may
turn
it
must
remain
wretched
the
poor
by
reason
of
the
sufferings
entailed
by
want
the
rich
by
reason
of
the
unconquerable
weariness
engendered
by
abundance
but
this
philosophy
promised
no
universal
remedies
did
not
entice
one
with
false
hopes
so
as
to
minimize
the
inevitable
evils
of
life
he
did
not
affirm
the
revolting
conception
of
original
sin
nor
did
he
feel
inclined
to
argue
that
it
is
a
beneficent
god
who
protects
the
worthless
and
wicked
rains
misfortunes
on
children
stultifies
the
aged
and
afflicts
the
innocent
he
did
not
exalt
the
virtues
of
a
providence
which
has
invented
that
useless
incomprehensible
unjust
and
senseless
abomination
physical
suffering
far
from
seeking
to
justify
as
does
the
church
the
necessity
of
torments
and
afflictions
he
cried
in
his
outraged
pity
if
a
god
has
made
this
world
i
should
not
wish
to
be
that
god
the
world
wretchedness
would
rend
my
heart
ah
schopenhauer
alone
was
right
compared
with
these
treatises
of
spiritual
hygiene
of
what
avail
were
the
evangelical
pharmacopoeias
he
did
not
claim
to
cure
anything
and
he
offered
no
alleviation
to
the
sick
but
his
theory
of
pessimism
was
in
the
end
the
great
consoler
of
choice
intellects
and
lofty
souls
he
revealed
society
as
it
is
asserted
woman
inherent
stupidity
indicated
the
safest
course
preserved
you
from
disillusionment
by
warning
you
to
restrain
hopes
as
much
as
possible
to
refuse
to
yield
to
their
allurement
to
deem
yourself
fortunate
finally
if
they
did
not
come
toppling
about
your
ears
at
some
unexpected
moment
traversing
the
same
path
as
the
this
theory
too
ended
in
similar
highways
of
resignation
and
indifference
but
without
going
astray
in
mysterious
labyrinths
and
remote
roads
but
if
this
resignation
which
was
obviously
the
only
outcome
of
the
deplorable
condition
of
things
and
their
irremediability
was
open
to
the
spiritually
rich
it
was
all
the
more
difficult
of
approach
to
the
poor
whose
passions
and
cravings
were
more
easily
satisfied
by
the
benefits
of
religion
these
reflections
relieved
des
esseintes
of
a
heavy
burden
the
aphorisms
of
the
great
german
calmed
his
excited
thoughts
and
the
points
of
contact
in
these
two
doctrines
helped
him
to
correlate
them
and
he
could
never
forget
that
poignant
and
poetic
catholicism
in
which
he
had
bathed
and
whose
essence
he
had
long
ago
absorbed
these
reversions
to
religion
these
intimations
of
faith
tormented
him
particularly
since
the
changes
that
had
lately
taken
place
in
his
health
their
progress
coincided
with
that
of
his
recent
nervous
disorders
he
had
been
tortured
since
his
youth
by
inexplicable
aversions
by
shudderings
which
chilled
his
spine
and
made
him
grit
his
teeth
as
for
example
when
he
saw
a
girl
wringing
wet
linen
these
reactions
had
long
persisted
even
now
he
suffered
poignantly
when
he
heard
the
tearing
of
cloth
the
rubbing
of
a
finger
against
a
piece
of
chalk
or
a
hand
touching
a
bit
of
moire
the
excesses
of
his
youthful
life
the
exaggerated
tension
of
his
mind
had
strangely
aggravated
his
earliest
nervous
disorder
and
had
thinned
the
already
impoverished
blood
of
his
race
in
paris
he
had
been
compelled
to
submit
to
hydrotherapic
treatments
for
his
trembling
fingers
frightful
pains
neuralgic
strokes
which
cut
his
face
in
two
drummed
maddeningly
against
his
temples
pricked
his
eyelids
agonizingly
and
induced
a
nausea
which
could
be
dispelled
only
by
lying
flat
on
his
back
in
the
dark
these
afflictions
had
gradually
disappeared
thanks
to
a
more
regulated
and
sane
mode
of
living
they
now
returned
in
another
form
attacking
his
whole
body
the
pains
left
his
head
but
affected
his
inflated
stomach
his
entrails
seemed
pierced
by
hot
bars
of
iron
a
nervous
cough
racked
him
at
regular
intervals
awakening
and
almost
strangling
him
in
his
bed
then
his
appetite
forsook
him
gaseous
hot
acids
and
dry
heats
coursed
through
his
stomach
he
grew
swollen
was
choked
for
breath
and
could
not
endure
his
clothes
after
each
attempt
at
eating
he
shunned
alcoholic
beverages
coffee
and
tea
and
drank
only
milk
and
he
took
recourse
to
baths
of
cold
water
and
dosed
himself
with
assafoetida
valerian
and
quinine
he
even
felt
a
desire
to
go
out
and
strolled
about
the
country
when
the
rainy
days
came
to
make
it
desolate
and
still
he
obliged
himself
to
take
exercise
as
a
last
resort
he
temporarily
abandoned
his
books
and
corroded
with
ennui
determined
to
make
his
listless
life
tolerable
by
realizing
a
project
he
had
long
deferred
through
laziness
and
a
dislike
of
change
since
his
installment
at
fontenay
being
no
longer
able
to
intoxicate
himself
with
the
felicities
of
style
with
the
delicious
witchery
of
the
rare
epithet
which
while
remaining
precise
yet
opens
to
the
imagination
of
the
initiate
infinite
and
distant
vistas
he
determined
to
give
the
finishing
touches
to
the
decorations
of
his
home
he
would
procure
precious
flowers
and
thus
permit
himself
a
material
occupation
which
might
distract
him
calm
his
nerves
and
rest
his
brain
he
also
hoped
that
the
sight
of
their
strange
and
splendid
nuances
would
in
some
degree
atone
for
the
fanciful
and
genuine
colors
of
style
which
he
was
for
the
time
to
lose
from
his
literary
diet
chapter
he
had
always
been
passionately
fond
of
flowers
but
during
his
residence
at
jutigny
that
love
had
been
lavished
upon
flowers
of
all
sorts
he
had
never
cultivated
distinctions
and
discriminations
in
regard
to
them
now
his
taste
in
this
direction
had
grown
refined
and
for
a
long
time
he
had
scorned
the
popular
plants
which
grow
in
flat
baskets
in
watered
pots
under
green
awnings
or
under
the
red
parasols
of
parisian
markets
simultaneous
with
the
refinement
of
his
literary
taste
and
his
preoccupations
with
art
which
permitted
him
to
be
content
only
in
the
presence
of
choice
creations
distilled
by
subtly
troubled
brains
and
simultaneous
with
the
weariness
he
began
to
feel
in
the
presence
of
popular
ideas
his
love
for
flowers
had
grown
purged
of
all
impurities
and
lees
and
had
become
clarified
he
compared
a
florist
shop
to
a
microcosm
wherein
all
the
categories
of
society
are
represented
here
are
poor
common
flowers
the
kind
found
in
hovels
which
are
truly
at
home
only
when
resting
on
ledges
of
garret
windows
their
roots
thrust
into
milk
bottles
and
old
pans
like
the
for
example
and
one
also
finds
stupid
and
pretentious
flowers
like
the
rose
which
belongs
in
the
porcelain
flowerpots
painted
by
young
girls
then
there
are
flowers
of
noble
lineage
like
the
orchid
so
delicate
and
charming
at
once
cold
and
palpitating
exotic
flowers
exiled
in
the
heated
glass
palaces
of
paris
princesses
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
living
in
solitude
having
absolutely
nothing
in
common
with
the
street
plants
and
other
bourgeois
flora
he
permitted
himself
to
feel
a
certain
interest
and
pity
only
for
the
popular
flowers
enfeebled
by
their
nearness
to
the
odors
of
sinks
and
drains
in
the
poor
quarters
in
revenge
he
detested
the
bouquets
harmonizing
with
the
cream
and
gold
rooms
of
pretentious
houses
for
the
joy
of
his
eyes
he
reserved
those
distinguished
rare
blooms
which
had
been
brought
from
distant
lands
and
whose
lives
were
sustained
by
artful
devices
under
artificial
equators
but
this
very
choice
this
predilection
for
the
conservatory
plants
had
itself
changed
under
the
influence
of
his
mode
of
thought
formerly
during
his
parisian
days
his
love
for
artificiality
had
led
him
to
abandon
real
flowers
and
to
use
in
their
place
replicas
faithfully
executed
by
means
of
the
miracles
performed
with
india
rubber
and
wire
calico
and
taffeta
paper
and
silk
he
was
the
possessor
of
a
marvelous
collection
of
tropical
plants
the
result
of
the
labors
of
skilful
artists
who
knew
how
to
follow
nature
and
recreate
her
step
by
step
taking
the
flower
as
a
bud
leading
it
to
its
full
development
even
imitating
its
decline
reaching
such
a
point
of
perfection
as
to
convey
every
nuance
the
most
fugitive
expressions
of
the
flower
when
it
opens
at
dawn
and
closes
at
evening
observing
the
appearance
of
the
petals
curled
by
the
wind
or
rumpled
by
the
rain
applying
dew
drops
of
gum
on
its
matutinal
corollas
shaping
it
in
full
bloom
when
the
branches
bend
under
the
burden
of
their
sap
or
showing
the
dried
stem
and
shrivelled
cupules
when
calyxes
are
thrown
off
and
leaves
fall
to
the
ground
this
wonderful
art
had
held
him
entranced
for
a
long
while
but
now
he
was
dreaming
of
another
experiment
he
wished
to
go
one
step
beyond
instead
of
artificial
flowers
imitating
real
flowers
natural
flowers
should
mimic
the
artificial
ones
he
directed
his
ideas
to
this
end
and
had
not
to
seek
long
or
go
far
since
his
house
lay
in
the
very
heart
of
a
famous
horticultural
region
he
visited
the
conservatories
of
the
avenue
de
chatillon
and
of
the
aunay
valley
and
returned
exhausted
his
purse
empty
astonished
at
the
strange
forms
of
vegetation
he
had
seen
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
species
he
had
acquired
and
continually
haunted
by
memories
of
magnificent
and
fantastic
plants
the
flowers
came
several
days
later

holding
a
list
in
his
hands

each
one
of
his
purchases
the
gardeners
from
their
wagons

a
collection
of
caladiums
which
sustained
enormous
heartshaped
leaves
on
turgid
hairy
stalks
while
preserving
an
air
of
relationship
with
its
neighbor
no
one
leaf
repeated
the
same
pattern
others
were
equally
extraordinary
the
roses
like
the
seemed
cut
out
of
varnished
cloth
or
the
white
ones
like
the
appeared
to
have
been
cut
out
of
an

transparent
pleura
or
the
diaphanous
bladder
of
a
pig

parodied
pieces
of

having
a
hue
of

by

of

and
by
spots
of
white
and
red
lead

like

of
a
starched
calico
in
crimson
and

still
others
like
the
displayed

the
color
of
raw
meat
streaked
with
purple

from
which
oozed
blue
wine
and
blood
the
and
the
sounded
the
two
extreme
notes
of
temperament
the
apoplexy
and
chlorosis
of
this
plant
the
gardeners
brought
still
other
varieties
which
had
the
appearance
of
artificial
skin
ridged
with
false
veins
and
most
of
them
looked
as
though
consumed
by
syphilis
and
leprosy
for
they
exhibited
livid
surfaces
of
flesh
veined
with
scarlet
rash
and
damasked
with
eruptions
some
had
the
deep
red
hue
of
scars
that
have
just
closed
or
the
dark
tint
of
incipient
scabs
others
were
marked
with
matter
raised
by
scaldings
there
were
forms
which
exhibited
shaggy
skins
hollowed
by
ulcers
and
relieved
by
cankers
and
a
few
appeared
embossed
with
wounds
covered
with
black
mercurial
hog
lard
with
green
unguents
of
belladonna
smeared
with
grains
of
dust
and
the
yellow
micas
of
iodoforme
collected
in
his
home
these
flowers
seemed
to
des
esseintes
more
monstrous
than
when
he
had
beheld
them
confused
with
others
among
the
glass
rooms
of
the
conservatory
he
exclaimed
enthusiastically
a
new
plant
modelled
like
the
caladiums
the
excited
him
even
more
it
was
coated
with
a
layer
of
bronze
green
on
which
glanced
silver
reflections
it
was
the
masterpiece
of
artificiality
it
could
be
called
a
piece
of
stove
pipe
cut
by
a

the
form
of
a
pike

the
men
next
brought
clusters
of
leaves
in
shape
and
in
color
in
the
center
rose
a
rod
at
whose
end
a
varnished
ace
of
hearts
swayed
as
though
meaning
to
defy
all
conceivable
forms
of
plants
a
fleshy
stalk
climbed
through
the
heart
of
this
intense
vermilion
ace
a
stalk
that
in
some
specimens
was
straight
in
others
showed
ringlets
like

it
was

they
brought
a
new
batch
of
monstrosities
from
the
wagon
issuing
from
padded
compresses
with
flowers
that
looked
like
the
pitiful
stumps
gaping
revealing
skinless
foundations
in
steel
plates
the
color
of
wine
must
with
jagged
scrapers
with
complicated
contours
a
crazy
piece
of
work
seemingly
designed
by
a
crazy
inventor
they
looked
like
sabots
or
like
a
lady
on
which
lies
a
human
tongue
with
taut
filaments
such
as
one
sees
designed
on
the
illustrated
pages
of
works
treating
of
the
diseases
of
the
throat
and
mouth

little
of
a
red
jujube
color
which
appeared
to

this
singular
collection
of
a
tongue

with
the
color
of

of
a
glossy
pocket
from

lining
oozed
a
viscous
glue
he
could
not
remove
his
eyes
from
this
unnatural
orchid
which
had
been
brought
from

then
the
gardeners
impatient
at

procrastinations
themselves
began
to
read

labels

to

pots
they
were
carrying

looked
on
and
listened
to
the
cacophonous
sounds
of
the
names
the
a
gigantic
iron
artichoke
like
those
put
on
portals
of
chateaux
to
foil
wall
climbers
the
a
sort
of
notched
and
slender
palm
surrounded
by
tall
leaves
resembling
paddles
and
oars
the
an
immense
pineapple
a
wondrous
chester
leaf
planted
in
soil
its
top
bristling
with
barbed
javelins
and
jagged
arrows
the
surpassing
the
others
by
the
craziness
of
its
structure
hurling
a
defiance
to
revery
as
it
darted
through
the
palmated
foliage
an
enormous
tail
a
hairy
dark
tail
whose
end
was
twisted
into
the
shape
of
a
cross
but
he
gave
little
heed
for
he
was
impatiently
awaiting
the
series
of
plants
which
most
bewitched
him
the
vegetable

the
carnivorous
plants
the
with
its
shaggy
border
secreting
a
digestive
liquid
armed
with
crooked
prickles
coiling
around
each
other

a
grating
about
the
imprisoned
insect
the
of

glandular

the
and
the
opening
greedy
horns
capable
of
digesting
and
absorbing
real
meat
lastly
the
whose
capricious
appearance
transcends
all
limits
of
eccentric
forms
he
never
wearied
of
turning
in
his
hands
the
pot
in
which
this
floral
extravagance
stirred
it
imitated
the
whose
long
leaf
of
dark
metallic
green
it
possessed
but
it
differed
in
that
a
green
string
hung
from
the
end
of
its
leaf
an
umbilic
cord
supporting
a
greenish
urn
streaked
with
jasper
a
sort
of
german
porcelain
pipe
a
strange
bird
nest
which
tranquilly
swung
about
revealing
an
interior
covered
with
hair
this
is
really
something
worth
while
des

murmured
he
was
forced
to
tear
himself
away
for
the
gardeners
anxious
to
leave
were
emptying
the
wagons
of
their
contents
and
depositing
without
any
semblance
of
order
the
tuberous
and
black
stained
like
sheet
iron
with
saturn
red
then
he
perceived
that
one
name
still
remained
on
his
list
it
was
the
of
new
granada
on
it
was
designed
a
little
winged
bell
of
a
faded
lilac
an
almost
dead
mauve
he
approached
placed
his
nose
above
the
plant
and
quickly
recoiled
it
exhaled
an
odor
of
toy
boxes
of
painted
pine
it
recalled
the
horrors
of
a
new
year
day
he
felt
that
he
would
do
well
to
mistrust
it
and
he
almost
regretted
having
admitted
among
the
scentless
plants
this
orchid
which
evoked
the
most
disagreeable
memories
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
his
gaze
took
in
this
vegetable
tide
which
foamed
in
the
vestibule
intermingled
with
each
other
they
crossed
their
swords
their
krisses
and
stanchions
taking
on
a
resemblance
to
a
green
pile
of
arms
above
which
like
barbaric
penons
floated
flowers
with
hard
dazzling
colors
the
air
of
the
room
grew
rarefied
then
in
the
shadowy
dimness
of
a
corner
near
the
floor
a
white
soft
light
crept
he
approached
and
perceived
that
the
phenomenon
came
from
the
which
threw
out
these
gleams
while
respiring
these
plants
are
amazing
he
reflected
then
he
drew
back
to
let
his
eye
encompass
the
whole
collection
at
a
glance
his
purpose
was
achieved
not
one
single
specimen
seemed
real
the
cloth
paper
porcelain
and
metal
seemed
to
have
been
loaned
by
man
to
nature
to
enable
her
to
create
her
monstrosities
when
unable
to
imitate
handiwork
nature
had
been
reduced
to
copying
the
inner
membranes
of
animals
to
borrowing
the
vivid
tints
of
their
rotting
flesh
their
magnificent
corruptions
all
is
syphilis
thought

his
eye
riveted
upon
the
horrible
streaked
stainings
of
the
caladium
plants
caressed
by
a
ray
of
light
and
he
beheld
a
sudden
vision
of
humanity
consumed
through
the
centuries
by
the
virus
of
this
disease
since
the
beginnings
every
single
creature
had
from
sire
to

transmitted
the

heritage
the
eternal
malady
which
has

decidedly

artists
nowadays
he
was
a
little
tired
and
he
felt
stifled
in
this
atmosphere
of
crowded
plants
the
promenades
he
had
taken
during
the
last
few
days
had
exhausted
him
the
transition
had
been
too
sudden
from
the
tepid
atmosphere
of
his
room
to
the
from
the
placid
tranquillity
of
a
reclusive
life
to
an
active
one
he
left
the
vestibule
and
stretched
out
on
his
bed
to
rest
but
absorbed
by
this
new
fancy
of
his
his
mind
even
in
his
sleep
could
not
lessen
its
tension
and
he
was
soon
wandering
among
the
gloomy
insanities
of
a
nightmare
he
found
himself
in
the
center
of
a
walk
in
the
heart
of
the
wood
twilight
had
fallen
he
was
strolling
by
the
side
of
a
woman
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
she
was
emaciated
and
had
flaxen
hair
a
bulldog
face
freckles
on
her
cheeks
crooked
teeth
projecting
under
a
flat
nose
she
wore
a
nurse
white
apron
a
long
neckerchief
torn
in
strips
on
her
bosom
like
those
worn
by
prussian
soldiers
and
a
black
bonnet
adorned
with
frillings
and
trimmed
with
a
rosette
there
was
a
foreign
look
about
her
like
that
of
a
mountebank
at
a
fair
he
asked
himself
who
the
woman
could
be
he
felt
that
she
had
long
been
an
intimate
part
of
his
life
vainly
he
sought
her
origin
her
name
her
profession
her
reason
for
being
no
recollection
of
this
liaison
which
was
inexplicable
and
yet
positive
rewarded
him
he
was
searching
his
past
for
a
clue
when
a
strange
figure
suddenly
appeared
on
before
them
trotting
about
for
a
moment
and
then
turning
around
in
its
saddle
des
esseintes
heart
almost
stopped
beating
and
he
stood
riveted
to
the
spot
with
horror
he
nearly
fainted
this
enigmatic
sexless
figure
was
green
through
her
violet
eyelids
the
eyes
were
terrible
in
their
cold
blue
pimples
surrounded
her
mouth
horribly
emaciated
skeleton
arms
bared
to
the
elbows
issued
from
ragged
tattered
sleeves
and
trembled
feverishly
and
the
skinny
legs
shivered
in
shoes
that
were
several
sizes
too
large
the
ghastly
eyes
were
fixed
on
des
esseintes
penetrating
him
freezing
his
very
marrow
wilder
than
ever
the
bulldog
woman
threw
herself
at
him
and
commenced
to
howl
like
a
dog
at
the
killing
her
head
hanging
on
her
rigid
neck
suddenly
he
understood
the
meaning
of
the
frightful
vision
before
him
was
the
image
of
syphilis
pursued
by
fear
and
quite
beside
himself
he
sped
down
a
pathway
at
top
speed
and
gained
a
pavillion
standing
among
the
laburnums
to
the
left
where
he
fell
into
a
chair
in
the
passage
way
after
a
few
moments
when
he
was
beginning
to
recover
his
breath
the
sound
of
sobbing
made
him
lift
his
head
the
bulldog
woman
was
in
front
of
him
and
grotesque
and
woeful
while
warm
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
she
told
him
that
she
had
lost
her
teeth
in
her
flight
as
she
spoke
she
drew
clay
pipes
from
the
pocket
of
her
nurse
apron
breaking
them
and
shoving
pieces
of
the
stems
into
the
hollows
of
her
gums
but
she
is
really
absurd
des
esseintes
told
himself
these
stems
will
never
stick
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
dropped
out
one
after
another
at
this
moment
were
heard
the
galloping
sounds
of
an
approaching
horse
a
fearful
terror
pierced
des
esseintes
his
limbs
gave
way
the
galloping
grew
louder
despair
brought
him
sharply
to
his
senses
he
threw
himself
upon
the
woman
who
was
stamping
on
the
pipe
bowls
entreating
her
to
be
silent
not
to
give
notice
of
their
presence
by
the
sound
of
her
shoes
she
writhed
and
struggled
in
his
grip
he
led
her
to
the
end
of
the
corridor
strangling
her
to
prevent
her
from
crying
out
suddenly
he
noticed
the
door
of
a
coffee
house
with
green
venetian
shutters
it
was
unlocked
he
pushed
it
rushed
in
headlong
and
then
paused
before
him
in
the
center
of
a
vast
glade
huge
white
pierrots
were
leaping
under
the
rays
of
the
moon
tears
of
discouragement
welled
to
his
eyes
never
no
never
would
he
succeed
in
crossing
the
threshold
i
shall
be
crushed
he
thought
and
as
though
to
justify
his
fears
the
ranks
of
tall
pierrots
swarmed
and
multiplied
their
somersaults
now
covered
the
entire
horizon
the
whole
sky
on
which
they
landed
now
on
their
heads
now
on
their
feet
then
the
hoof
beats
paused
he
was
in
the
passage
behind
a
round
skylight
more
dead
than
alive
des
esseintes
turned
about
and
through
the
round
window
beheld
projecting
erect
ears
yellow
teeth
nostrils
from
which
breathed
two
jets
of
vapor
smelling
of
phenol
he
sank
to
the
ground
renouncing
all
ideas
of
flight
or
of
resistance
he
closed
his
eyes
so
as
not
to
behold
the
horrible
gaze
of
syphilis
which
penetrated
through
the
wall
which
even
pierced
his
closed
lids
which
he
felt
gliding
over
his
moist
spine
over
his
body
whose
hair
bristled
in
pools
of
cold
sweat
he
waited
for
the
worst
and
even
hoped
for
the
de
to
end
everything
a
moment
which
seemed
to
last
a
century
passed
shuddering
he
opened
his
eyes
everything
had
vanished
without
any
transition
as
though
by
some
stage
device
a
frightful
mineral
landscape
receded
into
the
distance
a
wan
dead
waste
gullied
landscape
a
light
illumined
this
desolate
site
a
peaceful
white
light
that
recalled
gleams
of
phosphorus
dissolved
in
oil
something
that
stirred
on
the
ground
became
a
deathly
pale
nude
woman
whose
feet
were
covered
with
green
silk
stockings
he
contemplated
her
with
curiosity
as
though
frizzed
by
overheated
irons
her
hair
curled
becoming
straight
again
at
the
end
her
distended
nostrils
were
the
color
of
roast
veal
her
eyes
were
desirous
and
she
called
to
him
in
low
tones
he
had
no
time
to
answer
for
already
the
woman
was
changing
flamboyant
colors
passed
and
repassed
in
her
eyes
her
lips
were
stained
with
a
furious
anthurium
red
the
nipples
of
her
breasts
flashed
painted
like
two
pods
of
red
pepper
a
sudden
intuition
came
to
him
it
is
the
flower
he
said
and
his
reasoning
mania
persisted
in
his
nightmare
then
he
observed
the
frightful
irritation
of
the
breasts
and
mouth
discovered
spots
of
bister
and
copper
on
the
skin
of
her
body
and
recoiled
bewildered
but
the
woman
eyes
fascinated
him
and
he
advanced
slowly
attempting
to
thrust
his
heels
into
the
earth
so
as
not
to
move
letting
himself
fall
and
yet
lifting
himself
to
reach
her
just
as
he
touched
her
the
dark
leaped
up
from
all
sides
and
thrust
their
leaves
into
his
abdomen
which
rose
and
fell
like
a
sea
he
had
broken
all
the
plants
experiencing
a
limitless
disgust
in
seeing
these
warm
firm
stems
stirring
in
his
hands
suddenly
the
detested
plants
had
disappeared
and
two
arms
sought
to
enlace
him
a
terrible
anguish
made
his
heart
beat
furiously
for
the
eyes
the
horrible
eyes
of
the
woman
had
become
a
clear
cold
and
terrible
blue
he
made
a
superhuman
effort
to
free
himself
from
her
embrace
but
she
held
him
with
an
irresistible
movement
he
beheld
the
wild
which
yawned
bleeding
in
steel
plates
with
his
body
he
touched
the
hideous
wound
of
this
plant
he
felt
himself
dying
awoke
with
a
start
suffocating
frozen
mad
with
fear
and
sighing
ah
thank
god
it
was
but
a
dream
chapter
these
nightmares
attacked
him
repeatedly
he
was
afraid
to
fall
asleep
for
hours
he
remained
stretched
on
his
bed
now
a
prey
to
feverish
and
agitated
wakefulness
now
in
the
grip
of
oppressive
dreams
in
which
he
tumbled
down
flights
of
stairs
and
felt
himself
sinking
powerless
into
abysmal
depths
his
nervous
attacks
which
had
abated
for
several
days
became
acute
more
violent
and
obstinate
than
ever
unearthing
new
tortures
the
bed
covers
tormented
him
he
stifled
under
the
sheets
his
body
smarted
and
tingled
as
though
stung
by
swarms
of
insects
these
symptoms
were
augmented
by
a
dull
pain
in
his
jaws
and
a
throbbing
in
his
temples
which
seemed
to
be
gripped
in
a
vise
his
alarm
increased
but
unfortunately
the
means
of
subduing
the
inexorable
malady
were
not
at
hand
he
had
unsuccessfully
sought
to
install
a
hydropathic
apparatus
in
his
dressing
room
but
the
impossibility
of
forcing
water
to
the
height
on
which
his
house
was
perched
and
the
difficulty
of
procuring
water
even
in
the
village
where
the
fountains
functioned
sparingly
and
only
at
certain
hours
of
the
day
caused
him
to
renounce
the
project
since
he
could
not
have
floods
of
water
playing
on
him
from
the
nozzle
of
a
hose
the
only
efficacious
means
of
overcoming
his
insomnia
and
calming
his
nerves
through
its
action
on
his
spinal
column
he
was
reduced
to
brief
sprays
or
to
mere
cold
baths
followed
by
energetic
massages
applied
by
his
servant
with
the
aid
of
a
glove
but
these
measures
failed
to
stem
the
march
of
his
nervous
disorder
at
best
they
afforded
him
a
few
hours
relief
dearly
paid
for
by
the
return
of
the
attacks
in
an
even
more
virulent
form
his
ennui
passed
all
bounds
his
pleasure
in
the
possession
of
his
wonderful
flowers
was
exhausted
their
textures
and
nuances
palled
on
him
besides
despite
the
care
he
lavished
on
them
most
of
his
plants
drooped
he
had
them
removed
from
his
rooms
but
in
his
state
of
extreme
excitability
their
very
absence
exasperated
him
for
his
eyes
were
pained
by
the
void
to
while
away
the
interminable
hours
he
had
recourse
to
his
portfolios
of
prints
and
arranged
his
goyas
the
first
impressions
of
certain
plates
of
the
recognizable
as
proofs
by
their
reddish
hues
which
he
had
bought
at
auction
at
a
high
price
comforted
him
and
he
lost
himself
in
them
following
the
fantasies
distracted
by
his
vertiginous
scenes
his
witches
astride
on
cats
his
women
striving
to
pluck
out
the
teeth
of
a
hanged
man
his
bandits
his
succubi
his
demons
and
dwarfs
then
he
examined
his
other
series
of
etchings
and
aquatints
his
with
their
macabre
horror
his
war
subjects
with
their
wild
rage
finally
his
plate
of
the
garot
of
which
he
cherished
a
marvelous
trial
proof
printed
on
heavy
paper
unmounted
goya
savage
verve
and
keenly
fanciful
talent
delighted
him
but
the
universal
admiration
his
works
had
won
nevertheless
estranged
him
slightly
and
for
years
he
had
refused
to
frame
them
for
fear
that
the
first
blundering
fool
who
caught
sight
of
them
might
deem
it
necessary
to
fly
into
banal
and
facile
raptures
before
them
the
same
applied
to
his
rembrandts
which
he
examined
from
time
to
time
half
secretly
and
if
it
be
true
that
the
loveliest
tune
imaginable
becomes
vulgar
and
insupportable
as
soon
as
the
public
begins
to
hum
it
and
the
make
it
their
own
the
work
of
art
which
does
not
remain
indifferent
to
the
spurious
artists
which
is
not
contested
by
fools
and
which
is
not
satisfied
with
awakening
the
enthusiasm
of
the
few
by
this
very
fact
becomes
profaned
trite
almost
repulsive
to
the
initiate
this
promiscuity
in
admiration
furthermore
was
one
of
the
greatest
sources
of
regret
in
his
life
incomprehensible
successes
had
forever
spoiled
for
him
many
pictures
and
books
once
cherished
and
dear
approved
by
the
mob
they
began
to
reveal
imperceptible
defects
to
him
and
he
rejected
them
wondering
meanwhile
if
his
perceptions
were
not
growing
blunted
he
closed
his
portfolios
and
completely
disconcerted
again
plunged
into
melancholy
to
divert
the
current
of
his
thoughts
and
cool
his
brain
he
sought
books
that
would
soothe
him
and
turned
to
the
romances
of
dickens
those
charming
novels
which
are
so
satisfying
to
invalids
and
convalescents
who
might
grow
fatigued
by
works
of
a
more
profound
and
vigorous
nature
but
they
produced
an
effect
contrary
to
his
expectations
these
chaste
lovers
these
protesting
heroines
garbed
to
the
neck
loved
among
the
stars
confined
themselves
to
lowered
eyes
and
blushes
wept
tears
of
joy
and
clasped
hands
an
exaggeration
of
purity
which
threw
him
into
an
opposite
excess
by
the
law
of
contrast
he
leaped
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
let
his
imagination
dwell
on
vibrant
scenes
between
human
lovers
and
mused
on
their
sensual
kisses
and
passionate
embraces
his
mind
wandered
off
from
his
book
to
worlds
far
removed
from
the
english
prude
to
wanton
peccadilloes
and
salacious
practices
condemned
by
the
church
he
grew
excited
the
impotence
of
his
mind
and
body
which
he
had
supposed
final
vanished
solitude
again
acted
on
his
disordered
nerves
he
was
once
more
obsessed
not
by
religion
itself
but
by
the
acts
and
sins
it
forbids
by
the
subject
of
all
its
obsecrations
and
threats
the
carnal
side
atrophied
for
months
which
had
been
stirred
by
the
enervation
of
his
pious
readings
then
brought
to
a
crisis
by
the
english
cant
came
to
the
surface
his
stimulated
senses
carried
him
back
to
the
past
and
he
wallowed
in
memories
of
his
old
sin
he
rose
and
pensively
opened
a
little
box
of
vermeil
with
a
lid
of
aventurine
it
was
filled
with
violet
bonbons
he
took
one
up
and
pressed
it
between
his
fingers
thinking
of
the
strange
properties
of
this
sugary
frosted
sweetmeat
when
his
virility
had
been
impaired
when
the
thought
of
woman
had
roused
in
him
no
sharp
regret
or
desire
he
had
only
to
put
one
in
his
mouth
let
it
melt
and
almost
at
once
it
induced
misty
languishing
memories
infinitely
tender
these
bonbons
invented
by
siraudin
and
bearing
the
ridiculous
name
of
perles
des
pyrenees
were
each
a
drop
of
sarcanthus
perfume
a
drop
of
feminine
essence
crystallized
in
a
morsel
of
sugar
they
penetrated
the
papillae
of
the
tongue
recalling
the
very
savor
of
voluptuous
kisses
usually
he
smiled
as
he
inhaled
this
love
aroma
this
shadow
of
a
caress
which
for
a
moment
restored
the
delights
of
women
he
had
once
adored
today
they
were
not
merely
suggestive
they
no
longer
served
as
a
delicate
hint
of
his
distant
riotous
past
they
were
become
powerful
thrusting
aside
the
veils
exposing
before
his
eyes
the
importunate
corporeal
and
brutal
reality
at
the
head
of
the
procession
of
mistresses
whom
the
fragrance
of
the
bonbons
helped
to
place
in
bold
relief
one
paused
displaying
long
white
teeth
a
satiny
rose
skin
a
snub
nose
eyes
and
blond
hair
this
was
miss
urania
an
american
with
a
vigorous

she
had
been
one
of
the
most
celebrated
acrobats
of
the
circus
des
esseintes
had
watched
her
attentively
through
many
long
evenings
at
first
she
had
seemed
to
him
what
she
really
was
a
strong
and
beautiful
woman
but
the
desire
to
know
her
never
troubled
him
she
possessed
nothing
to
recommend
her
in
the
eyes
of
a
blase
man
and
yet
he
returned
to
the
circus
allured
by
he
knew
not
what
importuned
by
a
sentiment
difficult
to
define
gradually
as
he
watched
her
a
fantastic
idea
seized
him
her
graceful
antics
and
arch
feminine
ways
receded
to
the
background
of
his
mind
replaced
by
her
power
and
strength
which
had
for
him
all
the
charm
of
masculinity
compared
with
her
des
esseintes
seemed
to
himself
a
frail
effeminate
creature
and
he
began
to
desire
her
as
ardently
as
an
anaemic
young
girl
might
desire
some
loutish
hercules
whose
arms
could
crush
her
in
a
strong
embrace
one
evening
he
finally
decided
to
communicate
with
her
and
dispatched
one
of
the
attendants
on
this
errand
miss
urania
deemed
it
necessary
not
to
yield
before
a
preliminary
courtship
but
she
showed
herself
amenable
as
it
was
common
gossip
that
des
esseintes
was
rich
and
that
his
name
was
instrumental
in
establishing
women
but
as
soon
as
his
wishes
were
granted
his
disappointment
surpassed
any
he
had
yet
experienced
he
had
persuaded
himself
that
the
american
woman
would
be
as
bestial
and
stupid
as
a
wrestler
at
a
county
fair
and
instead
her
stupidity
was
of
an
altogether
feminine
nature
certainly
she
lacked
education
and
tact
had
neither
good
sense
nor
wit
and
displayed
an
animal
voracity
at
table
but
she
possessed
all
the
childish
traits
of
a
woman
her
manner
and
speech
were
coquettish
and
affected
those
of
a
silly
young
girl
there
was
absolutely
nothing
masculine
about
her
furthermore
she
was
withdrawn
and
puritanical
in
her
embraces
displaying
none
of
the
brute
force
he
had
dreaded
yet
longed
for
and
she
was
subject
to
none
of
the
perturbations
of
his
sex
des
esseintes
inevitably
returned
to
the
masculine
role
he
had
momentarily
abandoned
his
impression
of
femininity
weakness
need
of
protection
of
fear
even
disappeared
the
illusion
was
no
longer
possible
miss
urania
was
an
ordinary
mistress
in
no
wise
justifying
the
cerebral
curiosity
she
had
at
first
awakened
in
him
although
the
charm
of
her
firm
skin
and
magnificent
beauty
had
at
first
astonished
and
captivated
des
esseintes
he
lost
no
time
in
terminating
this
liaison
for
his
impotence
was
prematurely
hastened
by
the
frozen
and
prudish
caresses
of
this
woman
and
yet
she
was
the
first
of
all
the
women
he
had
loved
now
flitting
through
his
revery
to
stand
out
but
if
she
was
more
strongly
imprinted
on
his
memory
than
a
host
of
others
whose
allurements
had
been
less
spurious
and
more
seductive
the
reason
must
be
ascribed
to
her
healthy
animalism
to
her
exuberance
which
contrasted
so
strikingly
with
the
perfumed
anaemia
of
the
others
a
faint
suggestion
of
which
he
found
in
the
delicate
siraudin
bonbon
miss
urania
haunted
him
by
reason
of
her
very
difference
but
almost
instantly
offended
by
the
intrusion
of
this
natural
crude
aroma
the
antithesis
of
the
scented
confection
des
esseintes
returned
to
more
civilized
exhalations
and
his
thoughts
reverted
to
his
other
mistresses
they
pressed
upon
him
in
a
throng
but
above
them
all
rose
a
woman
whose
startling
talents
had
satisfied
him
for
months
she
was
a
little
slender
brunette
with
black
eyes
and
burnished
hair
parted
on
one
side
and
sleeked
down
over
her
head
he
had
known
her
in
a
cafe
where
she
gave
ventriloqual
performances
before
the
amazed
patrons
she
caused
her
tiny
cardboard
figures
placed
near
each
other
on
chairs
to
talk
she
conversed
with
the
animated
mannikins
while
flies
buzzed
around
the
chandeliers
then
one
heard
the
rustling
of
the
tense
audience
surprised
to
find
itself
seated
and
instinctively
recoiling
when
they
heard
the
rumbling
of
imaginary
carriages
des
esseintes
had
been
fascinated
he
lost
no
time
in
winning
over
the
ventriloquist
tempting
her
with
large
sums
of
money
she
delighted
him
by
the
very
contrast
she
exhibited
to
the
american
woman
this
brunette
used
strong
perfumes
and
burned
like
a
crater
despite
all
her
blandishments
des
esseintes
wearied
of
her
in
a
few
short
hours
but
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
letting
himself
be
fleeced
for
the
phenomenon
of
the
ventriloquist
attracted
him
more
than
did
the
charms
of
the
mistress
certain
plans
he
had
long
pondered
upon
ripened
and
he
decided
to
bring
them
to
fruition
one
evening
he
ordered
a
tiny
sphinx
brought
in
a
sphinx
carved
from
black
marble
and
resting
in
the
classic
pose
with
outstretched
paws
and
erect
head
he
also
purchased
a
chimera
of
polychrome
clay
it
brandished
its
mane
of
hair
and
its
sides
resembled
a
pair
of
bellows
these
two
images
he
placed
in
a
corner
of
the
room
then
he
extinguished
the
lamps
permitting
the
glowing
embers
to
throw
a
dim
light
around
the
room
and
to
magnify
the
objects
which
were
almost
immersed
in
gloom
then
he
stretched
out
on
a
couch
beside
the
woman
whose
motionless
figure
was
touched
by
the
ember
gleams
and
waited
with
strange
intonations
that
he
had
long
and
patiently
taught
her
she
animated
the
two
monsters
she
did
not
even
move
her
lips
she
did
not
even
glance
in
their
direction
and
in
the
silence
followed
the
marvelous
dialogue
of
the
chimera
and
the
sphinx
it
was
recited
in
deep
guttural
tones
which
were
at
first
raucous
then
turned
shrill
and
unearthly
here
chimera
pause
never
lulled
by
the
admirable
prose
of
flaubert
he
listened
he
panted
and
shivering
sensations
raced
through
his
frame
when
the
chimera
uttered
the
magical
and
solemn
phrase
new
perfumes
i
seek
stranger
flowers
i
seek
pleasures
not
yet
discovered
ah
it
was
to
him
that
this
voice
mysterious
as
an
incantation
spoke
it
was
to
him
that
this
voice
recounted
her
feverish
agitation
for
the
unknown
her
insatiable
ideals
her
imperative
need
to
escape
from
the
horrible
reality
of
existence
to
leap
beyond
the
confines
of
thought
to
grope
towards
the
mists
of
elusive
unattainable
art
the
poignant
tragedy
of
his
past
failures
rent
his
heart
gently
he
clasped
the
silent
woman
at
his
side
he
sought
refuge
in
her
nearness
like
a
child
who
is
inconsolable
he
was
blind
to
the
sulkiness
of
the
comedienne
obliged
to
perform
in
her
leisure
moments
far
from
the
spotlight
their
liaison
continued
but
his
spells
of
exhaustion
soon
became
acute
his
brain
no
longer
sufficed
to
stimulate
his
benumbed
body
no
longer
did
his
nerves
obey
his
will
and
now
the
crazy
whims
of
dotards
dominated
him
terrified
by
the
approach
of
a
disastrous
weakness
in
the
presence
of
his
mistress
he
resorted
to
fear
that
oldest
most
efficacious
of
excitants
a
hoarse
voice
from
behind
the
door
would
exclaim
while
he
held
the
woman
in
his
arms
open
the
door
woman
i
know
you
in
there
and
with
whom
just
wait
wait
instantly
like
a
libertine
stirred
by
fear
of
discovery
in
the
open
he
recovered
his
strength
and
hurled
himself
madly
upon
the
ventriloquist
whose
voice
continued
to
bluster
outside
the
room
in
this
wise
he
experienced
the
pleasures
of
a
person
but
this
state
unfortunately
did
not
last
long
and
despite
the
sums
he
paid
her
the
ventriloquist
parted
to
offer
herself
to
someone
less
exigent
and
less
complex
he
had
regretted
her
defection
and
now
recalling
her
the
other
women
seemed
insipid
their
childish
graces
and
monotonous
coquetry
disgusting
him
in
the
ferment
of
his
disordered
brain
he
delighted
in
mingling
with
these
recollections
of
his
past
other
more
gloomy
pleasures
as
theology
qualifies
the
evocation
of
past
disgraceful
acts
with
the
physical
visions
he
mingled
spiritual
ardors
brought
into
play
and
motivated
by
his
old
readings
of
the
casuists
of
the
busembaums
and
the
dianas
of
the
liguoris
and
the
sanchezes
treating
of
transgressions
against
the
sixth
and
ninth
commandments
of
the
decalogue
in
awakening
an
almost
divine
ideal
in
this
soul
steeped
in
her
precepts
a
soul
possibly
predisposed
to
the
teachings
of
the
church
through
hereditary
influences
dating
back
from
the
reign
of
henry
iii
religion
had
also
stirred
the
illegitimate
forbidden
enjoyment
of
the
senses
licentious
and
mystical
obsessions
haunted
his
brain
they
mingled
confusedly
and
he
would
often
be
troubled
by
an
unappeasable
desire
to
shun
the
vulgarities
of
the
world
and
to
plunge
far
from
the
customs
and
modes
held
in
such
reverence
into
convulsions
and
raptures
which
were
holy
or
infernal
and
which
in
either
case
proved
too
exhausting
and
enervating
he
would
arise
prostrate
from
such
reveries
fatigued
and
all
but
lifeless
he
would
light
the
lamps
and
candles
so
as
to
flood
the
room
with
light
for
he
hoped
that
by
so
doing
he
might
possibly
diminish
the
intolerably
persistent
and
dull
throbbing
of
his
arteries
which
beat
under
his
neck
with
redoubled
strokes
chapter
during
the
course
of
this
malady
which
attacks
impoverished
races
sudden
calms
succeed
an
attack
strangely
enough
des
esseintes
awoke
one
morning
recovered
no
longer
was
he
tormented
by
the
throbbing
of
his
neck
or
by
his
racking
cough
instead
he
had
an
ineffable
sensation
of
contentment
a
lightness
of
mind
in
which
thought
was
sparklingly
clear
turning
from
a
turbid
opaque
green
color
to
a
liquid
iridescence
magical
with
tender
rainbow
tints
this
lasted
several
days
then
hallucinations
of
odor
suddenly
appeared
his
room
was
aromatic
with
the
fragrance
of
frangipane
he
tried
to
ascertain
if
a
bottle
were
not
uncorked
no
not
a
bottle
was
to
be
found
in
the
room
and
he
passed
into
his
study
and
thence
to
the
kitchen
still
the
odor
persisted
des
esseintes
rang
for
his
servant
and
asked
if
he
smelled
anything
the
domestic
sniffed
the
air
and
declared
he
could
not
detect
any
perfume
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
his
nervous
attacks
had
returned
again
under
the
appearance
of
a
new
illusion
of
the
senses
fatigued
by
the
tenacity
of
this
imaginary
aroma
he
resolved
to
steep
himself
in
real
perfumes
hoping
that
this
homeopathic
treatment
would
cure
him
or
would
at
least
drown
the
persistent
odor
he
betook
himself
to
his
dressing
room
there
near
an
old
baptistery
which
he
used
as
a
wash
basin
under
a
long
mirror
of
forged
iron
which
like
the
edge
of
a
well
silvered
by
the
moon
confined
the
green
dull
surface
of
the
mirror
were
bottles
of
every
conceivable
size
and
form
placed
on
ivory
shelves
he
set
them
on
the
table
and
divided
them
into
two
series
one
of
the
simple
perfumes
pure
extracts
or
spirits
the
other
of
compound
perfumes
designated
under
the
generic
term
of
bouquets
he
sank
into
an
easy
chair
and
meditated
he
had
long
been
skilled
in
the
science
of
smell
he
believed
that
this
sense
could
give
one
delights
equal
to
those
of
hearing
and
sight
each
sense
being
susceptible
if
naturally
keen
and
if
properly
cultivated
to
new
impressions
which
it
could
intensify
coordinate
and
compose
into
that
unity
which
constitutes
a
creative
work
and
it
was
not
more
abnormal
and
unnatural
that
an
art
should
be
called
into
existence
by
disengaging
odors
than
that
another
art
should
be
evoked
by
detaching
sound
waves
or
by
striking
the
eye
with
diversely
colored
rays
but
if
no
person
could
discern
without
intuition
developed
by
study
a
painting
by
a
master
from
a
daub
a
melody
of
beethoven
from
one
by
clapisson
no
more
could
any
one
at
first
without
preliminary
initiation
help
confusing
a
bouquet
invented
by
a
sincere
artist
with
a
pot
pourri
made
by
some
manufacturer
to
be
sold
in
groceries
and
bazaars
in
this
art
the
branch
devoted
to
achieving
certain
effects
by
artificial
methods
particularly
delighted
him
perfumes
in
fact
rarely
come
from
the
flowers
whose
names
they
bear
the
artist
who
dared
to
borrow
nature
elements
would
only
produce
a
bastard
work
which
would
have
neither
authenticity
nor
style
inasmuch
as
the
essence
obtained
by
the
distillation
of
flowers
would
bear
but
a
distant
and
vulgar
relation
to
the
odor
of
the
living
flower
wafting
its
fragrance
into
the
air
thus
with
the
exception
of
the
inimitable
jasmine
which
it
is
impossible
to
counterfeit
all
flowers
are
perfectly
represented
by
the
blend
of
aromatic
spirits
stealing
the
very
personality
of
the
model
and
to
it
adding
that
nuance
the
more
that
heady
scent
that
rare
touch
which
entitled
a
thing
to
be
called
a
work
of
art
to
resume
in
the
science
of
perfumery
the
artist
develops
the
natural
odor
of
the
flowers
working
over
his
subject
like
a
jeweler
refining
the
lustre
of
a
gem
and
making
it
precious
little
by
little
the
arcana
of
this
art
most
neglected
of
all
was
revealed
to
des
esseintes
who
could
now
read
this
language
as
diversified
and
insinuating
as
that
of
literature
this
style
with
its
unexpected
concision
under
its
vague
flowing
appearance
to
achieve
this
end
he
had
first
been
compelled
to
master
the
grammar
and
understand
the
syntax
of
odors
learning
the
secret
of
the
rules
that
regulate
them
and
once
familiarized
with
the
dialect
he
compared
the
works
of
the
masters
of
the
atkinsons
and
lubins
the
chardins
and
violets
the
legrands
and
piesses
then
he
separated
the
construction
of
their
phrases
weighed
the
value
of
their
words
and
the
arrangement
of
their
periods
later
on
in
this
idiom
of
fluids
experience
was
able
to
support
theories
too
often
incomplete
and
banal
classic
perfumery
in
fact
was
scarcely
diversified
almost
colorless
and
uniformly
issuing
from
the
mold
cast
by
the
ancient
chemists
it
was
in
its
dotage
confined
to
its
old
alambics
when
the
romantic
period
was
born
and
had
modified
the
old
style
rejuvenating
it
making
it
more
supple
and
malleable
step
by
step
its
history
followed
that
of
our
language
the
perfumed
louis
xiii
style
composed
of
elements
highly
prized
at
that
time
of
iris
powder
musk
chive
and
myrtle
water
already
designated
under
the
name
of
water
of
the
angels
was
hardly
sufficient
to
express
the
cavalier
graces
the
rather
crude
tones
of
the
period
which
certain
sonnets
of
have
preserved
for
us
later
with
myrrh
and
olibanum
the
mystic
odors
austere
and
powerful
the
pompous
gesture
of
the
great
period
the
redundant
artifices
of
oratorial
art
the
full
sustained
harmonious
style
of
bossuet
and
the
masters
of
the
pulpit
were
almost
possible
still
later
the
sophisticated
rather
bored
graces
of
french
society
under
louis
xv
more
easily
found
their
interpretation
in
the
almond
which
in
a
manner
summed
up
this
epoch
then
after
the
ennui
and
jadedness
of
the
first
empire
which
misused

in

of

discovered

then
had
been
unattempted

it
complicated

it
resolutely
rejected
that
voluntary
decrepitude
to
which
it
had
been
reduced
by
the
malesherbes
the
boileaus
the

and
the
wretched
distillers
of
their
own

but
this

had
not
remained
stationery

period
of

had
continued
to
evolve
and

itself
on
the
progress
of

experimenting
to
corroborate
their
texts
he
took
pleasure
in
playing
the
role
of
a
psychologist
for
his
personal
satisfaction
in
taking
apart
and
the
machinery
of
a
work
in
separating
the
pieces
forming
the
structure
of
a
compound
exhalation
and
his
sense
of
smell
had
thereby
attained
a
sureness
that
was
all
but
perfect
just
as
a
wine
merchant
has
only
to
smell
a
drop
of
wine
to
recognize
the
grape
as
a
hop
dealer
determines
the
exact
value
of
hops
by
sniffing
a
bag
as
a
chinese
trader
can
immediately
tell
the
origin
of
the
teas
he
smells
knowing
in
what
farms
of
what
mountains
in
what
buddhistic
convents
it
was
cultivated
the
very
time
when
its
leaves
were
gathered
the
state
and
the
degree
of
torrefaction
the
effect
upon
it
of
its
proximity
to
the
and
other
flowers
to
all
those
perfumes
which
change
its
essence
adding
to
it
an
unexpected
touch
and
introducing
into
its
dryish
flavor
a
hint
of
distant
fresh
flowers
just
so
could
des
esseintes
by
inhaling
a
dash
of
perfume
instantly
explain
its
mixture
and
the
psychology
of
its
blend
and
could
almost
give
the
name
of
the
artist
who
had
composed
and
given
it
the
personal
mark
of
his
individual
style
naturally
he
had
a
collection
of
all
the
products
used
by
perfumers
he
even
had
the
real
mecca
balm
that
rare
balm
cultivated
only
in
certain
parts
of
arabia
petraea
and
under
the
monopoly
of
the
ruler
now
seated
in
his
dressing
room
in
front
of
his
table
he
thought
of
creating
a
new
bouquet
and
he
was
overcome
by
that
moment
of
wavering
confidence
familiar
to
writers
when
after
months
of
inaction
they
prepare
for
a
new
work
like
balzac
who
was
wont
to
scribble
on
many
sheets
of
paper
so
as
to
put
himself
in
a
mood
for
work
des
esseintes
felt
the
necessity
of
steadying
his
hand
by
several
initial
and
unimportant
experiments
desiring
to
create
heliotrope
he
took
down
bottles
of
vanilla
and
almond
then
changed
his
idea
and
decided
to
experiment
with
sweet
peas
he
groped
for
a
long
time
unable
to
effect
the
proper
combinations
for
orange
is
dominant
in
the
fragrance
of
this
flower
he
attempted
several
combinations
and
ended
in
achieving
the
exact
blend
by
joining
tuberose
and
rose
to
orange
the
whole
united
by
a
drop
of
vanilla
his
hesitation
disappeared
he
felt
alert
and
ready
for
work
now
he
made
some
tea
by
blending
cassie
with
iris
then
sure
of
his
technique
he
decided
to
proceed
with
a
fulminating
phrase
whose
thunderous
roar
would
annihilate
the
insidious
odor
of
almond
still
hovering
over
his
room
he
worked
with
amber
and
with
tonkin
musk
marvelously
powerful
with
patchouli
the
most
poignant
of
vegetable
perfumes
whose
flower
in
its
habitat
wafts
an
odor
of
mildew
try
what
he
would
the
eighteenth
century
obsessed
him
the
panier
robes
and
furbelows
appeared
before
his
eyes
memories
of
boucher
haunted
him
recollections
of
themidor
romance
of
the
exquisite
rosette
pursued
him
furious
he
rose
and
to
rid
himself
of
the
obsession
with
all
his
strength
he
inhaled
that
pure
essence
of
spikenard
so
dear
to
orientals
and
so
repulsive
to
europeans
because
of
its
pronounced
odor
of
valerian
he
was
stunned
by
the
violence
of
the
shock
as
though
pounded
by
hammer
strokes
the
filigranes
of
the
delicate
odor
disappeared
he
profited
by
the
period
of
respite
to
escape
the
dead
centuries
the
antiquated
fumes
and
to
enter
as
he
formerly
had
done
less
limited
or
more
recent
works
he
had
of
old
loved
to
lull
himself
with
perfumes
he
used
effects
analogous
to
those
of
the
poets
and
employed
the
admirable
order
of
certain
pieces
of
baudelaire
such
as
and
where
the
last
of
the
five
lines
composing
the
strophe
is
the
echo
of
the
first
verse
and
returns
like
a
refrain
to
steep
the
soul
in
infinite
depths
of
melancholy
and
languor
he
strayed
into
reveries
evoked
by
those
aromatic
stanzas
suddenly
brought
to
his
point
of
departure
to
the
motive
of
his
meditation
by
the
return
of
the
initial
theme
reappearing
at
stated
intervals
in
the
fragrant
orchestration
of
the
poem
he
actually
wished
to
saunter
through
an
astonishing
diversified
landscape
and
he
began
with
a
sonorous
ample
phrase
that
suddenly
opened
a
long
vista
of
fields
for
him
with
his
vaporizers
he
injected
an
essence
formed
of
ambrosia
lavender
and
sweet
peas
into
this
room
this
formed
an
essence
which
when
distilled
by
an
artist
deserves
the
name
by
which
it
is
known
extract
of
wild
grass
into
this
he
introduced
an
exact
blend
of
tuberose
orange
flower
and
almond
and
forthwith
artificial
lilacs
sprang
into
being
while
the
rustled
their
thin
emanations
imitated
by
extract
of
london
tilia
drooping
earthward
into
this
arranged
with
a
few
broad
lines
receding
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
under
his
closed
lids
he
introduced
a
light
rain
of
human
and
half
feline
essences
possessing
the
aroma
of
petticoats
breathing
of
the
powdered
painted
woman
the
stephanotis
ayapana
opopanax
champaka
sarcanthus
and
cypress
wine
to
which
he
added
a
dash
of
syringa
in
order
to
give
to
the
artificial
life
of
paints
which
they
exhaled
a
suggestion
of
natural
dewy
laughter
and
pleasures
enjoyed
in
the
open
air
then
through
a
ventilator
he
permitted
these
fragrant
waves
to
escape
only
preserving
the
field
which
he
renewed
compelling
it
to
return
in
his
strophes
like
a
ritornello
the
women
had
gradually
disappeared
now
the
plain
had
grown
solitary
suddenly
on
the
enchanted
horizon
factories
appeared
whose
tall
chimneys
flared
like
bowls
of
punch
the
odor
of
factories
and
of
chemical
products
now
passed
with
the
breeze
which
was
simulated
by
means
of
fans
nature
exhaled
its
sweet
effluvia
amid
this
putrescence
des
esseintes
warmed
a
pellet
of
storax
and
a
singular
odor
at
once
repugnant
and
exquisite
pervaded
the
room
it
partook
of
the
delicious
fragrance
of
jonquil
and
of
the
stench
of
gutta
percha
and
coal
oil
he
disinfected
his
hands
inserted
his
resin
in
a
hermetically
sealed
box
and
the
factories
disappeared
then
among
the
revived
vapors
of
the
lindens
and
meadow
grass
he
threw
several
drops
of
new
mown
hay
and
amid
this
magic
site
for
the
moment
despoiled
of
its
lilacs
sheaves
of
hay
were
piled
up
introducing
a
new
season
and
scattering
their
fine
effluence
into
these
summer
odors
at
last
when
he
had
sufficiently
enjoyed
this
sight
he
suddenly
scattered
the
exotic
perfumes
emptied
his
vaporizers
threw
in
his
concentrated
spirits
poured
his
balms
and
in
the
exasperated
and
stifling
heat
of
the
room
there
rose
a
crazy
sublimated
nature
a
paradoxical
nature
which
was
neither
genuine
nor
charming
reuniting
the
tropical
spices
and
the
peppery
breath
of
chinese
sandal
wood
and
jamaica
hediosmia
with
the
french
odors
of
jasmine
hawthorn
and
verbena
regardless
of
seasons
and
climates
he
forced
trees
of
diverse
essences
into
life
and
flowers
with
conflicting
fragrances
and
colors
by
the
clash
of
these
tones
he
created
a
general
nondescript
unexpected
strange
perfume
in
which
reappeared
like
an
obstinate
refrain
the
decorative
phrase
of
the
beginning
the
odor
of
the
meadows
fanned
by
the
lilacs
and
lindens
suddenly
a
poignant
pain
seized
him
he
felt
as
though
wimbles
were
drilling
into
his
temples
opening
his
eyes
he
found
himself
in
his
dressing
room
seated
in
front
of
his
table
stupefied
he
painfully
walked
across
the
room
to
the
window
which
he
half
opened
a
puff
of
wind
dispelled
the
stifling
atmosphere
which
was
enveloping
him
to
exercise
his
limbs
he
walked
up
and
down
gazing
at
the
ceiling
where
crabs
and
stood
out
in
relief
against
a
background
as
light
in
color
as
the
sands
of
the
seashore
a
similar
covered
the
plinths
and
bordered
the
partitions
which
were
covered
with
japanese
crepe
slightly
wrinkled
imitating
a
river
rippled
by
the
wind
in
this
light
current
swam
a
rose
petal
around
which
circled
a
school
of
tiny
fish
painted
with
two
strokes
of
the
brush
but
his
eyelids
remained
heavy
he
ceased
to
pace
about
the
short
space
between
the
baptistery
and
the
bath
he
leaned
against
the
window
his
dizziness
ended
he
carefully
stopped
up
the
vials
and
used
the
occasion
to
arrange
his
cosmetics
since
his
arrival
at
fontenay
he
had
not
touched
them
and
now
was
quite
astonished
to
behold
once
more
this
collection
formerly
visited
by
so
many
women
the
flasks
and
jars
were
lying
heaped
up
against
each
other
here
a
porcelain
box
contained
a
marvelous
white
cream
which
when
applied
on
the
cheeks
turns
to
a
tender
rose
color
under
the
action
of
the
air
to
such
a
true
that
it
procures
the
very
illusion
of
a
skin
touched
with
blood
there
lacquer
objects
incrusted
with
mother
of
pearl
enclosed
japanese
gold
and
athenian
green
the
color
of
the
cantharis
wing
gold
and
green
which
change
to
deep
purple
when
wetted
there
were
jars
filled
with
filbert
paste
the
serkis
of
the
harem
emulsions
of
lilies
lotions
of
strawberry
water
and
elders
for
the
complexion
and
tiny
bottles
filled
with
solutions
of
chinese
ink
and
rose
water
for
the
eyes
there
were
tweezers
scissors
rouge
and
files
and
beauty
patches
he
handled
this
collection
formerly
bought
to
please
a
mistress
who
swooned
under
the
influence
of
certain
aromatics
and
balms
a
nervous
unbalanced
woman
who
loved
to
steep
the
nipples
of
her
breasts
in
perfumes
but
who
never
really
experienced
a
delicious
and
overwhelming
ecstacy
save
when
her
head
was
scraped
with
a
comb
or
when
she
could
inhale
amid
caresses
the
odor
of
perspiration
or
the
plaster
of
unfinished
houses
on
rainy
days
or
of
dust
splashed
by
huge
drops
of
rain
during
summer
storms
he
mused
over
these
memories
and
one
afternoon
spent
at
pantin
through
idleness
and
curiosity
in
company
with
this
woman
at
the
home
of
one
of
her
sisters
returned
to
him
stirring
in
him
a
forgotten
world
of
old
ideas
and
perfumes
while
the
two
women
prattled
and
displayed
their
gowns
he
had
drawn
near
the
window
and
had
seen
through
the
dusty
panes
the
muddy
street
sprawling
before
him
and
had
heard
the
repeated
sounds
of
galoches
over
the
puddles
of
the
pavement
this
scene
already
far
removed
came
to
him
suddenly
strangely
and
vividly
pantin
was
there
before
him
animated
and
throbbing
in
this
greenish
and
dull
mirror
into
which
his
unseeing
eyes
plunged
a
hallucination
transported
him
far
from
fontenay
beside
reflecting
the
street
the
mirror
brought
back
thoughts
it
had
once
been
instrumental
in
evoking
and
plunged
in
revery
he
repeated
to
himself
this
ingenious
sad
and
comforting
composition
he
had
formerly
written
upon
returning
to
paris
yes
the
season
of
downpours
is
come
now
behold
vomiting
as
they
rush
over
the
pavements
and
rubbish
marinates
in
puddles
that
fill
the
holes
scooped
out
of
the
macadam
under
a
lowering
sky
in
the
damp
air
the
walls
of
houses
have
black
perspiration
and
their
are
fetid
the
loathsomeness
of
existence
increases
and
melancholy
overwhelms
one
the
seeds
of
vileness
which
each
person
harbors
in
his
soul
sprout
the
craving
for
vile
debaucheries
seizes
austere
people
and
base
desires
grow
rampant
in
the
brains
of
respectable
men
and
yet
i
warm
myself
here
before
a
cheerful
fire
from
a
basket
of
blossoming
flowers
comes
the
aroma
of
balsamic
benzoin
geranium
and
the
which
permeates
the
room
in
the
very
month
of
november
at
pantin
in
the
rue
de
paris
springtime
persists
here
in
my
solitude
i
laugh
at
the
fears
of
families
which
to
shun
the
approaching
cold
weather
escape
on
every
steamer
to
cannes
and
to
other
winter
resorts
inclement
nature
does
nothing
to
contribute
to
this
extraordinary
phenomenon
it
must
be
said
that
his
artificial
season
at
pantin
is
the
result
of
man
ingenuity
in
fact
these
flowers
are
made
of
taffeta
and
are
mounted
on
wire
the
springtime
odor
filters
through
the
window
joints
exhaled
from
the
neighboring
factories
from
the
perfumeries
of
pinaud
and
saint
james
for
the
workmen
exhausted
by
the
hard
labors
of
the
plants
for
the
young
employes
who
too
often
are
fathers
the
illusion
of
a
little
healthy
air
is
possible
thanks
to
these
manufacturers
so
from
this
fabulous
subterfuge
of
a
country
can
an
intelligent
cure
arise
the
consumptive
men
about
town
who
are
sent
to
the
south
die
their
end
due
to
the
change
in
their
habits
and
to
the
nostalgia
for
the
parisian
excesses
which
destroyed
them
here
under
an
artificial
climate
libertine
memories
will
reappear
the
languishing
feminine
emanations
evaporated
by
the
factories
instead
of
the
deadly
ennui
of
provincial
life
the
doctor
can
thus
platonically
substitute
for
his
patient
the
atmosphere
of
the
parisian
women
and
of
boudoirs
most
often
all
that
is
necessary
to
effect
the
cure
is
for
the
subject
to
have
a
somewhat
fertile
imagination
since
nowadays
nothing
genuine
exists
since
the
wine
one
drinks
and
the
liberty
one
boldly
proclaims
are
laughable
and
a
sham
since
it
really
needs
a
healthy
dose
of
good
will
to
believe
that
the
governing
classes
are
respectable
and
that
the
lower
classes
are
worthy
of
being
assisted
or
pitied
it
seems
to
me
concluded
des
esseintes
to
be
neither
ridiculous
nor
senseless
to
ask
of
my
fellow
men
a
quantity
of
illusion
barely
equivalent
to
what
they
spend
daily
in
idiotic
ends
so
as
to
be
able
to
convince
themselves
that
the
town
of
pantin
is
an
artificial
nice
or
a
menton
but
all
this
does
not
prevent
me
from
seeing
he
said
forced
by
weakness
from
his
meditations
that
i
must
be
careful
to
mistrust
these
delicious
and
abominable
practices
which
may
ruin
my
constitution
he
sighed
well
well
more
pleasures
to
moderate
more
precautions
to
be
taken
and
he
passed
into
his
study
hoping
the
more
easily
to
escape
the
spell
of
these
perfumes
he
opened
the
window
wide
glad
to
be
able
to
breath
the
air
but
it
suddenly
seemed
to
him
that
the
breeze
brought
in
a
vague
tide
of
bergamot
with
which
jasmine
and
rose
water
were
blent
agitated
he
asked
himself
whether
he
was
not
really
under
the
yoke
of
one
of
those
possessions
exercised
in
the
middle
ages
the
odor
changed
and
was
transformed
but
it
persisted
a
faint
scent
of
tincture
of
tolu
of
balm
of
peru
and
of
saffron
united
by
several
drams
of
amber
and
musk
now
issued
from
the
sleeping
village
and
suddenly
the
metamorphosis
was
effected
those
scattered
elements
were
blent
and
once
more
the
frangipane
spread
from
the
valley
of
fontenay
as
far
as
the
fort
assailing
his
exhausted
nostrils
once
more
shattering
his
helpless
nerves
and
throwing
him
into
such
a
prostration
that
he
fell
unconscious
on
the
window
sill
chapter
the
servants
were
seized
with
alarm
and
lost
no
time
in
calling
the
fontenay
physician
who
was
completely
at
sea
about
des
condition
he
mumbled
a
few
medical
terms
felt
his
pulse
examined
the
invalid
tongue
unsuccessfully
sought
to
make
him
speak
prescribed
sedatives
and
rest
promised
to
return
on
the
morrow
and
at
the
negative
sign
made
by
des
esseintes
who
recovered
enough
strength
to
chide
the
zeal
of
his
servants
and
to
bid
farewell
to
this
intruder
he
departed
and
was
soon
retailing
through
the
village
the
eccentricities
of
this
house
whose
decorations
had
positively
amazed
him
and
held
him
rooted
to
the
spot
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
domestics
who
no
longer
dared
stir
from
the
servants
quarters
their
master
recovered
in
a
few
days
and
they
surprised
him
drumming
against
the
window
panes
gazing
at
the
sky
with
a
troubled
look
one
afternoon
the
bells
were
peremptorily
rung
and
des
esseintes
commanded
his
trunks
to
be
packed
for
a
long
voyage
while
the
man
and
the
woman
were
choosing
under
his
guidance
the
necessary
equipment
he
feverishly
paced
up
and
down
the
cabin
of
the
dining
room
consulted
the
timetables
of
the
steamers
walked
through
his
study
where
he
continued
to
gaze
at
the
clouds
with
an
air
at
once
impatient
and
satisfied
for
a
whole
week
the
weather
had
been
atrocious
streams
of
soot
raced
unceasing
across
the
grey
fields
of
the
of
clouds
like
rocks
torn
from
the
earth
at
intervals
showers
swept
downward
engulfing
the
valley
with
torrents
of
rain
today
the
appearance
of
the
heavens
had
changed
the
rivers
of
ink
had
evaporated
and
vanished
and
the
harsh
contours
of
the
clouds
had
softened
the
sky
was
uniformly
flat
and
covered
with
a
brackish
film
little
by
little
this
film
seemed
to
drop
and
a
watery
haze
covered
the
country
side
the
rain
no
longer
fell
in
cataracts
as
on
the
preceding
evening
instead
it
fell
incessantly
fine
sharp
and
penetrating
it
inundated
the
walks
covered
the
roads
with
its
innumerable
threads
which
joined
heaven
and
earth
the
livid
sky
threw
a
wan
leaden
light
on
the
village
which
was
now
transformed
into
a
lake
of
mud
pricked
by
needles
of
water
that
dotted
the
puddles
with
drops
of
bright
silver
in
this
desolation
of
nature
everything
was
gray
and
only
the
housetops
gleamed
against
the
dead
tones
of
the
walls
what
weather
sighed
the
aged
domestic
placing
on
a
chair
the
clothes
which
his
master
had
requested
of
him
an
outfit
formerly
ordered
from
london
des
esseintes
sole
response
was
to
rub
his
hands
and
to
sit
down
in
front
of
a
with
glass
doors
he
examined
the
socks
which
had
been
placed
nearby
for
his
inspection
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
on
the
color
then
he
quickly
studied
the
melancholy
day
and
earnestly
bethought
himself
of
the
effect
he
desired
he
chose
a
pair
the
color
of
feuillemort
quickly
slipped
them
on
put
on
a
pair
of
buttoned
shoes
donned
the
mouse
grey
suit
which
was
checquered
with
a
lava
gray
and
dotted
with
black
placed
a
small
hunting
cap
on
his
head
and
threw
a
blue
raincoat
over
him
he
reached
the
railway
station
followed
by
the
servant
who
almost
bent
under
the
weight
of
a
trunk
a
valise
a
carpet
bag
a
hat
box
and
a
traveling
rug
containing
umbrellas
and
canes
he
informed
his
servant
that
the
date
of
his
return
was
problematical
that
he
might
return
in
a
year
in
a
month
in
a
week
or
even
sooner
and
enjoined
him
to
change
nothing
in
the
house
he
gave
a
sum
of
money
which
he
thought
would
be
necessary
for
the
upkeep
of
the
house
during
his
absence
and
climbed
into
the
coach
leaving
the
old
man
astounded
arms
waving
and
mouth
gaping
behind
the
rail
while
the
train
got
under
way
he
was
alone
in
his
compartment
a
vague
and
dirty
country
side
such
as
one
sees
through
an
aquarium
of
troubled
water
receded
rapidly
behind
the
train
which
was
lashed
by
the
rain
plunged
in
his
meditations
des
esseintes
closed
his
eyes
once
more
this
so
ardently
desired
and
finally
attained
solitude
had
ended
in
a
fearful
distress
this
silence
which
formerly
would
have
appeared
as
a
compensation
for
the
stupidities
heard
for
years
now
weighed
on
him
with
an
unendurable
burden
one
morning
he
had
awakened
as
uneasy
as
a
prisoner
in
his
cell
his
lips
had
sought
to
articulate
sounds
tears
had
welled
to
his
eyes
and
he
had
found
it
impossible
to
breathe
suffocating
like
a
person
who
had
sobbed
for
hours
seized
with
a
desire
to
walk
to
behold
a
human
figure
to
speak
to
someone
to
mingle
with
life
he
had
proceeded
to
call
his
domestics
employing
a
specious
pretext
but
conversation
with
them
was
impossible
besides
the
fact
that
these
old
people
bowed
down
by
years
of
silence
and
the
customs
of
attendants
were
almost
dumb
the
distance
at
which
des
esseintes
had
always
kept
them
was
hardly
conducive
to
inducing
them
to
open
their
mouths
now
too
they
possessed
dull
brains
and
were
incapable
of
answering
his
questions
other
than
by
monosyllables
it
was
impossible
therefore
to
find
any
solace
in
their
society
but
a
new
phenomenon
now
occurred
the
reading
of
the
novels
of
dickens
which
he
had
lately
undertaken
to
soothe
his
nerves
and
which
had
only
produced
effects
the
opposite
of
those
hoped
for
began
slowly
to
act
in
an
unexpected
manner
bringing
on
visions
of
english
existence
on
which
he
mused
for
hours
little
by
little
in
these
fictive
contemplations
ideas
insinuated
themselves
ideas
of
the
voyage
brought
to
an
end
of
verified
dreams
on
which
was
imposed
the
desire
to
experience
new
impressions
and
thus
escape
the
exhausting
cerebral
debauches
intent
upon
beating
in
the
void
with
its
mist
and
rain
this
abominable
weather
aided
his
thoughts
still
more
by
reinforcing
the
memories
of
his
readings
by
placing
under
his
eyes
the
unfading
image
of
a
land
of
fog
and
mud
and
by
refusing
to
let
his
ideas
wander
idly
one
day
able
to
endure
it
no
longer
he
had
instantly
decided
such
was
his
haste
that
he
even
took
flight
before
the
designated
time
for
he
wished
to
shun
the
present
moment
wished
to
find
himself
jostled
and
shouldered
in
the
hubbub
of
crowded
streets
and
railway
stations
i
breathe
he
exclaimed
when
the
train
moderated
its
waltz
and
stopped
in
the
sceaux
station
rotunda
panting
while
its
wheels
performed
its
last
pirouettes
once
in
the
boulevard
he
hailed
a
coachman
in
some
strange
manner
he
extracted
a
pleasure
from
the
fact
that
he
was
so
hampered
with
trunks
and
rugs
by
promising
a
substantial
tip
he
reached
an
understanding
with
the
man
of
the
brown
trousers
and
red
waistcoat
at
once
he
commanded
and
when
you
reach
the
rue
de
rivoli
stop
in
front
of
before
departing
he
desired
to
buy
a
baedeker
or
murray
guide
of
london
the
carriage
got
under
way
heavily
raising
rings
of
mud
around
its
wheels
and
moving
through
ground
beneath
the
gray
sky
which
seemed
suspended
over
the
house
tops
water
gushed
down
the
thick
sides
of
the
high
walls
spouts
overflowed
and
the
streets
were
coated
with
a
slimy
dirt
in
which
passersby
slipped
thickset
men
paused
on
sidewalks
bespattered
by
passing
omnibuses
and
women
their
skirts
tucked
up
to
the
knees
bent
under
umbrellas
flattened
themselves
against
the
shops
to
avoid
being
splashed
the
rain
entered
diagonally
through
the
carriage
doors
des

was
obliged
to
lift
the
carriage
windows
down
which
the
water
ran
while
drops
of
mud
furrowed
their
way
like
fireworks
on
each
side
of
the
to
the
monotonous
sound
of
sacks
of
peas
shaking
against
his
head
through
the
action
of
the
showers
pattering
against
the
trunks
and
on
the
carriage
rug
des
esseintes
dreamed
of
his
voyage
this
already
was
a
partial
realization
of
his
england
enjoyed
in
paris
through
the
means
of
this
frightful
weather
a
rainy
colossal
london
smelling
of
molten
metal
and
of
soot
ceaselessly
steaming
and
smoking
in
the
fog
now
spread
out
before
his
eyes
then
rows
of
docks
sprawled
ahead
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
docks
full
of
cranes
hand
winches
and
bales
swarming
with
men
perched
on
masts
or
astride
yard
sails
while
myriads
of
other
men
on
the
quays
pushed
hogsheads
into
cellars
all
this
was
transpiring
in
vast
warehouses
along
the
river
banks
which
were
bathed
by
the
muddy
and
dull
water
of
an
imaginary
thames
in
a
forest
of
masts
and
girders
piercing
the
wan
clouds
of
the
firmament
while
trains
rushed
past
at
full
speed
or
rumpled
underground
uttering
horrible
cries
and
vomiting
waves
of
smoke
and
while
through
every
street
monstrous
and
gaudy
and
infamous
advertisements
flared
through
the
eternal
twilight
and
strings
of
carriages
passed
between
rows
of
preoccupied
and
taciturn
people
whose
eyes
stared
ahead
and
whose
elbows
pressed
closely
against
their
bodies
des
esseintes
shivered
deliciously
to
feel
himself
mingling
in
this
terrible
world
of
merchants
in
this
insulating
mist
in
this
incessant
activity
in
this
pitiless
gearing
which
ground
millions
of
the
disinherited
urged
by
the
philanthropists
to
recite
biblical
verses
and
to
sing
psalms
then
the
vision
faded
suddenly
with
a
jolt
of
the
which
made
him
rebound
in
his
seat
he
gazed
through
the
carriage
windows
night
had
fallen
gas
burners
blinked
through
the
fog
amid
a
yellowish
halo
ribbons
of
fire
swam
in
puddles
of
water
and
seemed
to
revolve
around
wheels
of
carriages
moving
through
liquid
and
dirty
flame
he
endeavored
to
get
his
bearings
perceived
the
carrousel
and
suddenly
unreasoningly
perhaps
through
the
simple
effect
of
the
high
fall
from
fanciful
spaces
his
thought
reverted
to
a
very
trivial
incident
he
remembered
that
his
domestic
had
neglected
to
put
a
tooth
brush
in
his
belongings
then
he
passed
in
review
the
list
of
objects
packed
up
everything
had
been
placed
in
his
valise
but
the
annoyance
of
having
omitted
this
brush
persisted
until
the
driver
pulling
up
broke
the
chain
of
his
reminiscences
and
regrets
he
was
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
in
front
of
separated
by
a
door
whose
unpolished
glass
was
covered
with
inscriptions
and
with
strips
of
framing
newspaper
clippings
and
telegrams
were
two
vast
shop
windows
crammed
with
albums
and
books
he
drew
near
attracted
by
the
sight
of
these
books
bound
in
and
paper
embossed
with
silver
and
golden
letterings
all
this
had
an
touch
a
mercantile
appearance
more
brutal
and
yet
less
wretched
than
those
worthless
bindings
of
french
books
here
and
there
in
the
midst
of
the
opened
albums
reproducing
humorous
scenes
from
du
maurier
and
john
leech
or
the
delirious
cavalcades
of
caldecott
some
french
novels
appeared
blending
placid
and
satisfied
vulgarities
to
these
rich
verjuice
hues
he
tore
himself
away
from
his
contemplation
opened
the
door
and
entered
a
large
library
which
was
full
of
people
seated
strangers
unfolded
maps
and
jabbered
in
strange
languages
a
clerk
brought
him
a
complete
collection
of
guides
he
in
turns
sat
down
to
examine
the
books
with
their
flexible
covers
he
glanced
through
them
and
paused
at
a
page
of
the
baedeker
describing
the
london
museums
he
became
interested
in
the
laconic
and
exact
details
of
the
guide
books
but
his
attention
wandered
away
from
the
old
english
paintings
to
the
moderns
which
attracted
him
much
more
he
recalled
certain
works
he
had
seen
at
international
expositions
and
imagined
that
he
might
possibly
behold
them
once
more
at
london
pictures
by
millais
the
of
saint
with
its
lunar
clear
green
pictures
by
watts
strange
in
color
checquered
with
gamboge
and
indigo
pictures
sketched
by
a
sick
gustave
moreau
painted
by
an
anaemic
michael
angelo
and
retouched
by
a
raphael
submerged
in
blue
among
other
canvasses
he
recalled
a
of
an
some
where
in
the
strange
and
mysterious
mixture
of
these
three
masters
rose
the
personality
at
once
refined
and
crude
of
a
learned
and
dreamy
englishman
tormented
by
the
bewitchment
of
cruel
tones
these
canvasses
thronged
through
his
memory
the
clerk
astonished
by
this
client
who
was
so
lost
to
the
world
asked
him
which
of
the
guides
he
would
take
des
esseintes
remained
dumbfounded
then
excused
himself
bought
a
baedeker
and
departed
the
dampness
froze
him
to
the
spot
the
wind
blew
from
the
side
lashing
the
arcades
with
whips
of
rain
proceed
to
that
place
he
said
to
the
driver
pointing
with
his
finger
to
the
end
of
a
passage
where
a
store
formed
the
angle
of
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
the
rue
castiglione
and
with
its
whitish
panes
of
glass
illumed
from
within
resembled
a
vast
night
lamp
burning
through
the
wretchedness
of
this
mist
in
the
misery
of
this
crazy
weather
it
was
the
des

strayed
into
a
large
room
sustained
by
iron
pillars
and
lined
on
each
side
of
its
walls
with
tall
barrels
placed
on
their
ends
upon
gantries
hooped
with
iron
their
paunches
with
wooden
loopholes
imitating
a
rack
of
pipes
and
from
whose
notches
hung
glasses
upside
down
the
lower
sides
were
bored
and
hafted
with
stone
cocks
these
hogsheads
painted
with
a
royal
coat
of
arms
displayed
the
names
of
their
drinks
the
contents
and
the
prices
on
colored
labels
and
stated
that
they
were
to
be
purchased
by
the
cask
by
the
bottle
or
by
the
glass
in
the
passage
between
these
rows
of
casks
under
the
gas

flared
at
one
end
of
an
ugly
chandelier

covered
with
baskets
of

hard
and
salty
cakes

piled
with
mince
pies
and
sandwiches
concealing
strong
mustardy
concoctions
under
their
unsavory
covers
succeeded
each
other
between
a
row
of
seats
and
as
far
as
the
end
of
this
cellar
which
was
lined
with
still
more
hogsheads
carrying
tiny
barrels
on
their
tops
resting
on
their
sides
and
bearing
their
names
stamped
with
hot
metal
into
the
oak
an
odor
of
alcohol
assailed
des

upon
taking
a
seat
in
this
room
heavy
with
strong
wines
he
looked
about
him
here
the
tuns
were
placed
in
a
straight
line
exhibiting
the
whole
series
of
ports
the
sweet
or
sour
wines
the
color
of
mahogany

amaranth
and
distinguished
by
such
laudatory
epithets

closely
against

the
martial
spanish

the
cellar
was
filled
with
people
leaning
on
his
elbows
on
a
corner
of
the
table
des

sat
waiting
for
his
glass
of
port
ordered
of
a
gentleman
who
was
opening
explosive
sodas
contained
in
oval
bottles
which
recalled
while
exaggerating
the
capsules
of
gelatine
and
gluten
used
by
pharmacies
to
conceal
the
taste
of
certain
medicines

were
everywhere
awkward
pale
clergymen
garbed
in
black
from
head
to

with
soft
hats
laced
shoes
very
long
coats
dotted
in
the
front
with
tiny
buttons
chins
round
spectacles
greasy
flat
hair
faces
of
tripe
dealers
and
mastiff
snouts
with
apoplectic
necks
ears
like
tomatoes
vinous
cheeks
crazy
eyes
whiskers
that
looked
like
those
of
some
big
monkeys
farther
away
at
the
end
of
the
wine
store
a
long
row
of
individuals
their
chins
covered
with
white
hair
like
the
end
of
an
artichoke
reading
through
a
microscope
the
tiny
roman
type
of
an
english
newspaper
opposite
him
a
sort
of
american
commodore
dumpy
and
with
smoked
skin
and
bulbous
nose
was
sleeping
a
cigar
planted
in
the
hairy
aperture
of
his
mouth
opposite
were
frames
hanging
on
the
wall
enclosing
advertisements
of
champagne
the
trade
marks
of

and
a
hooded
head
of

enervation
enveloped

in

stunned
by
the
prattle
of
the
englishmen
conversing
among
themselves
he
fell
into
a
revery
evoking
before
the
purple
port
which
filled
the
glasses
the
creatures
of
dickens
that
love
this
drink
so
very
much
imaginatively
peopling
the
cellar
with
new
personages
seeing
here
the
white
head
of
hair
and
the
ruddy
complexion
of
wickfield
there
the
phlegmatic
crafty
face
and
the
vengeful
eye
of

the
melancholy
solicitor
in
positively
all
of

broke
away
from

and
installed
themselves
in

with
their
peculiar
characteristics
and
their
betraying

brought
to

the
city
of

perfectly

and
isolated

and

appeared
to
him
sailing
like
an
ark
in
a
deluge
of
mire
and
soot
idly
he
wandered
through
this
imaginary
london
happy
to
be
sheltered
as
he
listened
to
the
sinister
shrieks
of
tugs
plying
up
and
down
the
thames
his
glass
was
empty
despite
the
heavy
fumes
in
this
cellar
caused
by
the
cigars
and
pipes
he
experienced
a
cold
shiver
when
he
returned
to
the
reality
of
the
damp
and
fetid
weather
he
called
for
a
glass
of
amontillado
and
suddenly
beside
this
pale
dry
wine
the
lenitive
sweetish
stories
of
the
english
author
were
routed
to
be
replaced
by
the
pitiless
revulsives
and
the
grievous
irritants
of
edgar
allen
poe
the
cold
nightmares
of
cask
of
of
the
man
immured
in
a
vault
assailed
him
the
ordinary
placid
faces
of
american
and
english
drinkers
who
occupied
the
room
appeared
to
him
to
reflect
involuntary
frightful
thoughts
to
be
harboring
instinctive
odious
plots
then
he
perceived
that
he
was
left
alone
here
and
that
the
dinner
hour
was
near
he
payed
his
bill
tore
himself
from
his
seat
and
dizzily
gained
the
door
he
received
a
wet
slap
in
the
face
upon
leaving
the
place
the
street
lamps
moved
their
tiny
fans
of
flame
which
failed
to
illuminate
the
sky
had
dropped
to
the
very
houses
des
esseintes
viewed
the
arcades
of
the
rue
de
rivoli
drowned
in
the
gloom
and
submerged
by
water
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
in
the
gloomy
tunnel
under
the
thames
twitchings
of
his
stomach
recalled
him
to
reality
he
regained
his
carriage
gave
the
driver
the
address
of
the
tavern
in
the
rue
near
the
station
and
looked
at
his
watch
seven
he
had
just
time
to
eat
dinner
the
train
would
not
leave
until
ten
minutes
of
nine
and
he
counted
on
his
fingers
reckoning
the
hours
of
travel
from
dieppe
to
newhaven
saying
to
himself
if
the
figures
of
the
timetable
are
correct
i
shall
be
at
london
tomorrow
at
the
stopped
in
front
of
the
tavern
once
more
des
esseintes
alighted
and
entered
a
long
dark
plain
room
divided
into
partitions
as
high
as
a
man
waist
a
series
of
compartments
resembling
stalls
in
this
room
wider
towards
the
door
many
beer
pumps
stood
on
a
counter
near
hams
having
the
color
of
old
violins
red
lobsters
marinated
mackerel
with
onions
and
carrots
slices
of
lemon
bunches
of
laurel
and
thym
juniper
berries
and
long
peppers
swimming
in
thick
sauce
one
of
these
boxes
was
unoccupied
he
took
it
and
called
a
young
man
who
bent
forward
muttering
something
in
a
jargon
he
could
not
understand
while
the
cloth
was
being
laid
des
esseintes
viewed
his
neighbors
they
were
islanders
just
as
at
the
with
cold
faience
eyes
crimson
complexions
thoughtful
or
haughty
airs
they
were
reading
foreign
newspapers
the
only
ones
eating
were
unescorted
women
in
pairs
robust
english
women
with
boyish
faces
large
teeth
ruddy
apple
cheeks
long
hands
and
legs
they
attacked
with
genuine
ardor
a
rumpsteak
pie
a
warm
meat
dish
cooked
in
mushroom
sauce
and
covered
with
a
crust
like
a
pie
after
having
lacked
appetite
for
such
a
long
time
he
remained
amazed
in
the
presence
of
these
hearty
eaters
whose
voracity
whetted
his
hunger
he
ordered
oxtail
soup
and
enjoyed
it
heartily
then
he
glanced
at
the
menu
for
the
fish
ordered
a
haddock
and
seized
with
a
sudden
pang
of
hunger
at
the
sight
of
so
many
people
relishing
their
food
he
ate
some
roast
beef
and
drank
two
pints
of
ale
stimulated
by
the
flavor
of
a
which
this
fine
pale
beer
exhaled
his
hunger
persisted
he
lingered
over
a
piece
of
blue
stilton
cheese
made
quick
work
of
a
rhubarb
tart
and
to
vary
his
drinking
quenched
his
thirst
with
porter
that
dark
beer
which
smells
of
spanish
licorice
but
which
does
not
have
its
sugary
taste
he
breathed
deeply
not
for
years
had
he
eaten
and
drunk
so
much
this
change
of
habit
this
choice
of
unexpected
and
solid
food
had
awakened
his
stomach
from
its
long
sleep
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
lit
a
cigarette
and
prepared
to
sip
his
coffee
into
which
gin
had
been
poured
the
rain
continued
to
fall
he
heard
it
patter
on
the
panes
which
formed
a
ceiling
at
the
end
of
the
room
it
fell
in
cascades
down
the
spouts
no
one
was
stirring
in
the
room
everybody
utterly
weary
was
indulging
himself
in
front
of
his
wine
glass
tongues
were
now
wagging
freely
as
almost
all
the
english
men
and
women
raised
their
eyes
as
they
spoke
des
esseintes
concluded
that
they
were
talking
of
the
bad
weather
not
one
of
them
laughed
he
threw
a
delighted
glance
on
their
suits
whose
color
and
cut
did
not
perceivably
differ
from
that
of
others
and
he
experienced
a
sense
of
contentment
in
not
being
out
of
tune
in
this
environment
of
being
in
some
way
though
superficially
a
naturalized
london
citizen
then
he
suddenly
started
and
what
about
the
train
he
asked
himself
he
glanced
at
his
watch
ten
minutes
to
eight
i
still
have
nearly
a
to
remain
here
once
more
he
began
to
muse
upon
the
plan
he
had
conceived
in
his
sedentary
life
only
two
countries
had
ever
attracted
him
holland
and
england
he
had
satisfied
the
first
of
his
desires
unable
to
keep
away
one
fine
day
he
had
left
paris
and
visited
the
towns
of
the
low
lands
one
by
one
in
short
nothing
but
cruel
disillusions
had
resulted
from
this
trip
he
had
fancied
a
holland
after
the
works
of
teniers
and
steen
of
rembrandt
and
ostade
in
his
usual
way
imagining
rich
unique
and
incomparable
ghettos
had
thought
of
amazing
kermesses
continual
debauches
in
the
country
sides
intent
for
a
view
of
that
patriarchal
simplicity
that
jovial
lusty
spirit
celebrated
by
the
old
masters
certainly
haarlem
and
amsterdam
had
enraptured
him
the
unwashed
people
seen
in
their
country
farms
really
resembled
those
types
painted
by
van
ostade
with
their
uncouth
children
and
their
old
fat
women
embossed
with
huge
breasts
and
enormous
bellies
but
of
the
unrestrained
joys
the
drunken
family
carousals
not
a
whit
he
had
to
admit
that
the
dutch
paintings
at
the
louvre
had
misled
him
they
had
simply
served
as
a
springing
board
for
his
dreams
he
had
rushed
forward
on
a
false
track
and
had
wandered
into
capricious
visions
unable
to
discover
in
the
land
itself
anything
of
that
real
and
magical
country
which
he
had
hoped
to
behold
seeing
nothing
at
all
on
the
plots
of
ground
strewn
with
barrels
of
the
dances
of
petticoated
and
stockinged
peasants
crying
for
very
joy
stamping
their
feet
out
of
sheer
happiness
and
laughing
loudly
decidedly
nothing
of
all
this
was
visible
holland
was
a
country
just
like
any
other
country
and
what
was
more
a
country
in
no
wise
primitive
not
at
all
simple
for
the
protestant
religion
with
its
formal
hypocricies
and
solemn
rigidness
held
sway
here
the
memory
of
that
disenchantment
returned
to
him
once
more
he
glanced
at
his
watch
ten
minutes
still
separated
him
from
the
departure
it
is
about
time
to
ask
for
the
bill
and
leave
he
told
himself
he
felt
an
extreme
heaviness
in
his
stomach
and
through
his
body
come
he
addressed
himself
let
us
drink
and
screw
up
our
courage
he
filled
a
glass
of
brandy
while
asking
for
the
reckoning
an
individual
in
black
suit
and
with
a
napkin
under
one
arm
a
sort
of
majordomo
with
a
bald
and
sharp
head
a
greying
beard
without
moustaches
came
forward
a
pencil
rested
behind
his
ear
and
he
assumed
an
attitude
like
a
singer
one
foot
in
front
of
the
other
he
drew
a
note
book
from
his
pocket
and
without
glancing
at
his
paper
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ceiling
near
a
chandelier
wrote
while
counting
there
you
are
he
said
tearing
the
sheet
from
his
note
book
and
giving
it
to
des
esseintes
who
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
as
though
he
were
a
rare
animal
what
a
surprising
john
bull
he
thought
contemplating
this
phlegmatic
person
who
had
because
of
his
shaved
mouth
the
appearance
of
a
wheelsman
of
an
american
ship
at
this
moment
the
tavern
door
opened
several
persons
entered
bringing
with
them
an
odor
of
wet
dog
to
which
was
blent
the
smell
of
coal
wafted
by
the
wind
through
the
opened
door
des
esseintes
was
incapable
of
moving
a
limb
a
soft
warm
languor
prevented
him
from
even
stretching
out
his
hand
to
light
a
cigar
he
told
himself
come
now
let
us
get
up
we
must
take
ourselves
off
immediate
objections
thwarted
his
orders
what
is
the
use
of
moving
when
one
can
travel
on
a
chair
so
magnificently
was
he
not
even
now
in
london
whose
aromas
and
atmosphere
and
inhabitants
whose
food
and
utensils
surrounded
him
for
what
could
he
hope
if
not
new
disillusionments
as
had
happened
to
him
in
holland
he
had
but
sufficient
time
to
race
to
the
station
an
overwhelming
aversion
for
the
trip
an
imperious
need
of
remaining
tranquil
seized
him
with
a
more
and
more
obvious
and
stubborn
strength
pensively
he
let
the
minutes
pass
thus
cutting
off
all
retreat
and
he
said
to
himself
now
it
would
be
necessary
to
rush
to
the
gate
and
crowd
into
the
baggage
room
what
ennui
what
a
bore
that
would
be
then
he
repeated
to
himself
once
more
in
fine
i
have
experienced
and
seen
all
i
wished
to
experience
and
see
i
have
been
filled
with
english
life
since
my
departure
i
would
be
mad
indeed
to
go
and
by
an
awkward
trip
lose
those
imperishable
sensations
how
stupid
of
me
to
have
sought
to
disown
my
old
ideas
to
have
doubted
the
efficacy
of
the
docile
phantasmagories
of
my
brain
like
a
very
fool
to
have
thought
of
the
necessity
of
the
curiosity
of
the
interest
of
an
excursion
well
he
exclaimed
consulting
his
watch
it
is
now
time
to
return
home
this
time
he
arose
and
left
ordered
the
driver
to
bring
him
back
to
the
sceaux
station
and
returned
with
his
trunks
packages
valises
rugs
umbrellas
and
canes
to
fontenay
feeling
the
physical
stimulation
and
the
moral
fatigue
of
a
man
coming
back
to
his
home
after
a
long
and
dangerous
voyage
chapter
during
the
days
following
his
return
des
esseintes
contemplated
his
books
and
experienced
at
the
thought
that
he
might
have
been
separated
from
them
for
a
long
period
a
satisfaction
as
complete
as
that
which
comes
after
a
protracted
absence
under
the
touch
of
this
sentiment
these
objects
possessed
a
renewed
novelty
to
his
mind
and
he
perceived
in
them
beauties
forgotten
since
the
time
he
had
purchased
them
everything
there
books
and
furniture
had
an
individual
charm
for
him
his
bed
seemed
the
softer
by
comparison
with
the
hard
bed
he
would
have
occupied
in
london
the
silent
discreet
ministrations
of
his
servants
charmed
him
exhausted
as
he
was
at
the
thought
of
the
loud
loquacity
of
hotel
attendants
the
methodical
organization
of
his
life
made
him
feel
that
it
was
especially
to
be
envied
since
the
possibility
of
traveling
had
become
imminent
he
steeped
himself
in
this
bath
of
habitude
to
which
artificial
regrets
insinuated
a
tonic
quality
but
his
books
chiefly
preoccupied
him
he
examined
them
them
on
the
shelves
anxious
to
learn
if
the
hot
weather
and
the
rains
had
damaged
the
bindings
and
injured
the
rare
paper
he
began
by
moving
all
his
latin
books
then
he
arranged
in
a
new
order
the
special
works
of
archelaus
albert
le
grand
lully
and
arnaud
de
villanova
treating
of
cabbala
and
the
occult
sciences
finally
he
examined
his
modern
books
one
by
one
and
was
happy
to
perceive
that
all
had
remained
intact
this
collection
had
cost
him
a
considerable
sum
of
money
he
would
not
suffer
in
his
library
the
books
he
loved
to
resemble
other
similar
volumes
printed
on
cotton
paper
with
the
watermarks
of
formerly
in
paris
he
had
ordered
made
for
himself
alone
certain
volumes
which
specially
engaged
mechanics
printed
from
hand
presses
sometimes
he
applied
to
perrin
of
lyons
whose
graceful
clear
type
was
suitable
for
archaic
reprints
of
old
books
at
other
times
he
dispatched
orders
to
england
or
to
america
for
the
execution
of
modern
literature
and
the
works
of
the
present
century
still
again
he
applied
to
a
house
in
lille
which
for
centuries
had
possessed
a
complete
set
of
gothic
characters
he
also
would
send
requisitions
to
the
old
enschede
printing
house
of
haarlem
whose
foundry
still
has
the
stamps
and
dies
of
certain
antique
letters
he
had
followed
the
same
method
in
selecting
his
papers
finally
growing
weary
of
the
snowy
chinese
and
the
nacreous
and
gilded
japanese
papers
the
white
whatmans
the
brown
hollands
the
turkeys
and
seychal
mills
and
equally
disgusted
with
all
mechanically
manufactured
sheets
he
had
ordered
special
laid
paper
in
the
mould
from
the
old
plants
of
vire
which
still
employ
the
pestles
once
in
use
to
grind
hemp
to
introduce
a
certain
variety
into
his
collection
he
had
repeatedly
brought
from
london
prepared
stuffs
paper
interwoven
with
hairs
and
as
a
mark
of
his
disdain
for
bibliophiles
he
had
a
lubeck
merchant
prepare
for
him
an
improved
candle
paper
of
tint
clear
and
somewhat
brittle
in
the
pulp
of
which
the
straw
was
replaced
by
golden
spangles
resembling
those
which
dot
danzig
brandy
under
these
circumstances
he
had
succeeded
in
procuring
unique
books
adopting
obsolete
formats
which
he
had
bound
by
lortic
by
or
chambolle
by
the
successors
of
cape
in
irreproachable
covers
of
old
silk
stamped
cow
hide
cape
goat
skin
in
full
bindings
with
compartments
and
in
mosaic
designs
protected
by
tabby
or
moire
watered
silk
ecclesiastically
ornamented
with
clasps
and
corners
and
sometimes
even
enamelled
by
gruel
engelmann
with
silver
oxide
and
clear
enamels
thus
with
the
marvelous
episcopal
lettering
used
in
the
old
house
of
le
clere
he
had
baudelaire
works
printed
in
a
large
format
recalling
that
of
ancient
missals
on
a
very
light
and
spongy
japan
paper
soft
as
elder
pith
and
imperceptibly
tinted
with
a
light
rose
hue
through
its
milky
white
this
edition
limited
to
one
copy
printed
with
a
velvety
black
chinese
ink
had
been
covered
outside
and
then
recovered
within
with
a
wonderful
genuine
sow
skin
chosen
among
a
thousand
the
color
of
flesh
its
surface
spotted
where
the
hairs
had
been
and
adorned
with
black
silk
stamped
in
cold
iron
in
miraculous
designs
by
a
great
artist
that
day
des
esseintes
took
this
incomparable
book
from
his
shelves
and
handled
it
devotedly
once
more
reading
certain
pieces
which
seemed
to
him
in
this
simple
but
inestimable
frame
more
than
ordinarily
penetrating
his
admiration
for
this
writer
was
unqualified
according
to
him
until
baudelaire
advent
in
literature
writers
had
limited
themselves
to
exploring
the
surfaces
of
the
soul
or
to
penetrating
into
the
accessible
and
illuminated
caverns
restoring
here
and
there
the
layers
of
capital
sins
studying
their
veins
their
growths
and
noting
like
balzac
for
example
the
layers
of
strata
in
the
soul
possessed
by
the
monomania
of
a
passion
by
ambition
by
avarice
by
paternal
stupidity
or
by
senile
love
what
had
been
treated
heretofore
was
the
abundant
health
of
virtues
and
of
vices
the
tranquil
functioning
of
commonplace
brains
and
the
practical
reality
of
contemporary
ideas
without
any
ideal
of
sickly
depravation
or
of
any
beyond
in
short
the
discoveries
of
those
analysts
had
stopped
at
the
speculations
of
good
or
evil
classified
by
the
church
it
was
the
simple
investigation
the
conventional
examination
of
a
botanist
minutely
observing
the
anticipated
development
of
normal
efflorescence
abounding
in
the
natural
earth
baudelaire
had
gone
farther
he
had
descended
to
the
very
bowels
of
the
inexhaustible
mine
had
involved
his
mind
in
abandoned
and
unfamiliar
levels
and
come
to
those
districts
of
the
soul
where
monstrous
vegetations
of
thought
extend
their
branches
there
near
those
confines
the
haunt
of
aberrations
and
of
sickness
of
the
mystic
lockjaw
the
warm
fever
of
lust
and
the
typhoids
and
vomits
of
crime
he
had
found
brooding
under
the
gloomy
clock
of
ennui
the
terrifying
spectre
of
the
age
of
sentiments
and
ideas
he
had
revealed
the
morbid
psychology
of
the
mind
which
has
attained
the
october
of
its
sensations
recounted
the
symptoms
of
souls
summoned
by
grief
and
licensed
by
spleen
and
shown
the
increasing
decay
of
impressions
while
the
enthusiasms
and
beliefs
of
youth
are
enfeebled
and
the
only
thing
remaining
is
the
arid
memory
of
miseries
borne
intolerances
endured
and
affronts
suffered
by
intelligences
oppressed
by
a
ridiculous
destiny
he
had
pursued
all
the
phases
of
that
lamentable
autumn
studying
the
human
creature
quick
to
exasperation
ingenious
in
deceiving
himself
compelling
his
thoughts
to
cheat
each
other
so
as
to
suffer
the
more
keenly
and
frustrating
in
advance
all
possible
joy
by
his
faculty
of
analysis
and
observation
then
in
this
vexed
sensibility
of
the
soul
in
this
ferocity
of
reflection
that
repels
the
restless
ardor
of
devotions
and
the
outrages
of
charity
he
gradually
saw
arising
the
horror
of
those
senile
passions
those
ripe
loves
where
one
person
yields
while
the
other
is
still
suspicious
where
lassitude
denies
such
couples
the
filial
caresses
whose
apparent
youthfulness
seems
new
and
the
maternal
candors
whose
gentleness
and
comfort
impart
in
a
sense
the
engaging
remorse
of
a
vague
incest
in
magnificent
pages
he
exposed
his
hybrid
loves
who
were
exasperated
by
the
impotence
in
which
they
were
overwhelmed
the
hazardous
deceits
of
narcotics
and
poisons
invoked
to
aid
in
calming
suffering
and
conquering
ennui
at
an
epoch
when
literature
attributed
unhappiness
of
life
almost
exclusively
to
the
mischances
of
unrequited
love
or
to
the
jealousies
that
attend
adulterous
love
he
disregarded
such
puerile
maladies
and
probed
into
those
wounds
which
are
more
fatal
more
keen
and
deep
which
arise
from
satiety
disillusion
and
scorn
in
ruined
souls
whom
the
present
tortures
the
past
fills
with
loathing
and
the
future
frightens
and
menaces
with
despair
and
the
more
des
esseintes
read
baudelaire
the
more
he
felt
the
ineffable
charm
of
this
writer
who
in
an
age
when
verse
served
only
to
portray
the
external
semblance
of
beings
and
things
had
succeeded
in
expressing
the
inexpressible
in
a
muscular
and
brawny
language
who
more
than
any
other
writer
possessed
a
marvelous
power
to
define
with
a
strange
robustness
of
expression
the
most
fugitive
and
tentative
morbidities
of
exhausted
minds
and
sad
souls
after
baudelaire
works
the
number
of
french
books
given
place
in
his
shelves
was
strictly
limited
he
was
completely
indifferent
to
those
works
which
it
is
fashionable
to
praise
the
broad
laugh
of
rabelais
and
the
deep
comedy
of
moliere
did
not
succeed
in
diverting
him
and
the
antipathy
he
felt
against
these
farces
was
so
great
that
he
did
not
hesitate
to
liken
them
in
the
point
of
art
to
the
capers
of
circus
clowns
as
for
old
poetry
he
read
hardly
anything
except
villon
whose
melancholy
ballads
touched
him
and
here
and
there
certain
fragments
from
which
stimulated
his
blood
with
the
incredible
vehemence
of
their
apostrophes
and
curses
in
prose
he
cared
little
for
voltaire
and
rousseau
and
was
unmoved
even
by
diderot
whose
so
greatly
praised
he
found
strangely
saturated
with
moralizing
twaddle
and
futility
in
his
hatred
toward
all
this
balderdash
he
limited
himself
almost
exclusively
to
the
reading
of
christian
eloquence
to
the
books
of
bourdaloue
and
bossuet
whose
sonorously
embellished
periods
were
imposing
but
still
more
he
relished
suggestive
ideas
condensed
into
severe
and
strong
phrases
such
as
those
created
by
nicole
in
his
reflections
and
especially
pascal
whose
austere
pessimism
and
attrition
deeply
touched
him
apart
from
such
books
as
these
french
literature
began
in
his
library
with
the
nineteenth
century
this
section
was
divided
into
two
groups
one
of
which
included
the
ordinary
secular
literature
and
the
other
the
catholic
literature
a
special
but
little
known
literature
published
by
large
publishing
houses
and
circulated
to
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
he
had
had
the
hardihood
to
explore
such
crypts
as
these
just
as
in
the
secular
art
he
had
discovered
under
an
enormous
mass
of
insipid
writings
a
few
books
written
by
true
masters
the
distinctive
character
of
this
literature
was
the
constant
immutability
of
its
ideas
and
language
just
as
the
church
perpetuated
the
primitive
form
of
holy
objects
so
she
has
preserved
the
relics
of
her
dogmas
piously
retaining
as
the
frame
that
encloses
them
the
oratorical
language
of
the
celebrated
century
as
one
of
the
own
writers
ozanam
has
put
it
the
christian
style
needed
only
to
make
use
of
the
dialect
employed
by
bourdaloue
and
by
bossuet
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
in
spite
of
this
statement
the
church
more
indulgent
closed
its
eyes
to
certain
expressions
certain
turns
of
style
borrowed
from
the
secular
language
of
the
same
century
and
the
catholic
idiom
had
slightly
purified
itself
of
its
heavy
and
massive
phrases
especially
cleaning
itself
in
bossuet
of
its
prolixity
and
the
painful
rallying
of
its
pronouns
but
here
ended
the
concessions
and
others
would
doubtless
have
been
purposeless
for
the
prose
sufficed
without
this
ballast
for
the
limited
range
of
subjects
to
which
the
church
confined
itself
incapable
of
grappling
with
contemporary
life
of
rendering
the
most
simple
aspects
of
things
and
persons
visible
and
palpable
unqualified
to
explain
the
complicated
wiles
of
intellects
indifferent
to
the
benefits
of
salvation
this
language
was
nevertheless
excellent
when
it
treated
of
abstract
subjects
it
proved
valuable
in
the
argument
of
controversy
in
the
demonstration
of
a
theory
in
the
obscurity
of
a
commentary
and
more
than
any
other
style
had
the
necessary
authority
to
affirm
without
any
discussion
the
intent
of
a
doctrine
unfortunately
here
as
everywhere
the
sanctuary
had
been
invaded
by
a
numerous
army
of
pedants
who
smirched
by
their
ignorance
and
lack
of
talent
the
church
noble
and
austere
attire
further
to
profane
it
devout
women
had
interfered
and
stupid
sacristans
and
foolish
had
acclaimed
as
works
of
genius
the
wretched
prattle
of
such
women
among
such
works
des
esseintes
had
had
the
curiosity
to
read
those
of
madame
swetchine
the
russian
whose
house
in
paris
was
the
rendezvous
of
the
most
fervent
catholics
her
writings
had
filled
him
with
insufferably
horrible
boredom
they
were
more
than
merely
wretched
they
were
wretched
in
every
way
resembling
the
echoes
of
a
tiny
chapel
where
the
solemn
worshippers
mumble
their
prayers
asking
news
of
one
another
in
low
voices
while
they
repeat
with
a
deeply
mysterious
air
the
common
gossip
of
politics
weather
forecasts
and
the
state
of
the
weather
but
there
was
even
worse
a
female
laureate
licensed
by
the
institute
madame
augustus
craven
author
of
of
and
puffed
into
reputation
by
the
whole
apostolic
press
never
no
never
had
des
esseintes
imagined
that
any
person
could
write
such
ridiculous
nonsense
in
the
point
of
conception
these
books
were
so
absurd
and
were
written
in
such
a
disgusting
style
that
by
these
tokens
they
became
almost
remarkable
and
rare
it
was
not
at
all
among
the
works
of
women
that
des
esseintes
whose
soul
was
completely
jaded
and
whose
nature
was
not
inclined
to
sentimentality
could
come
upon
a
literary
retreat
suited
to
his
taste
yet
he
strove
with
a
diligence
that
no
impatience
could
overcome
to
enjoy
the
works
of
a
certain
girl
of
genius
the
pucelle
of
the
group
but
his
efforts
miscarried
he
did
not
take
to
the
and
the
in
which
eugenie
de
guerin
celebrates
without
discretion
the
amazing
talent
of
a
brother
who
rhymed
with
such
cleverness
and
grace
that
one
must
go
to
the
works
of
de
jouy
and
ecouchard
lebrun
to
find
anything
so
novel
and
daring
he
had
also
unavailingly
attempted
to
comprehend
the
delights
of
those
works
in
which
one
may
find
such
things
as
these
this
morning
i
hung
on
papa
bed
a
cross
which
a
little
girl
had
given
him
yesterday
or
mimi
and
i
are
invited
by
monsieur
roquiers
to
attend
the
consecration
of
a
bell
tomorrow
this
does
not
displease
me
at
all
or
wherein
we
find
such
important
events
as
these
on
my
neck
i
have
hung
a
medal
of
the
holy
virgin
which
louise
had
brought
me
as
an
amulet
against
cholera
or
poetry
of
this
sort
o
the
lovely
moonbeam
which
fell
on
the
bible
i
was
reading
and
finally
such
fine
and
penetrating
observations
as
these
when
i
see
a
man
pass
before
a
crucifix
lift
his
hat
and
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
i
say
to
myself
goes
a
christian
and
she
continued
in
this
fashion
without
pause
until
after
maurice
de
guerin
had
died
after
which
his
sister
bewailed
him
in
other
pages
written
in
a
watery
prose
strewn
here
and
there
with
bits
of
poems
whose
humiliating
poverty
ended
by
moving
des
esseintes
to
pity
ah
it
was
hardly
worth
mentioning
but
the
catholic
party
was
not
at
all
particular
in
the
choice
of
its
proteges
and
not
at
all
artistic
without
exception
all
these
writers
wrote
in
the
pallid
white
prose
of
pensioners
of
a
monastery
in
a
flowing
movement
of
phrase
which
no
astringent
could
counterbalance
so
des
esseintes
at
such
insipidities
entirely
forsook
this
literature
but
neither
did
he
find
atonement
for
his
disappointments
among
the
modern
masters
of
the
clergy
these
latter
were
divines
or
impeccably
correct
controversialists
but
the
christian
language
in
their
orations
and
books
had
ended
by
becoming
impersonal
and
congealing
into
a
rhetoric
whose
every
movement
and
pause
was
anticipated
in
a
sequence
of
periods
constructed
after
a
single
model
and
in
fact
des
esseintes
discovered
that
all
the
ecclesiastics
wrote
in
the
same
manner
with
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
abandon
or
emphasis
and
there
was
seldom
any
variations
between
the
bodiless
patterns
traded
by
dupanloup
or
landriot
la
bouillerie
or
gaume
by
dom
gueranger
or
ratisbonne
by
freppel
or
perraud
by
ravignan
or
gratry
by
olivain
or
dosithee
by
didon
or
chocarne
des
esseintes
had
often
pondered
upon
this
matter
a
really
authentic
talent
a
supremely
profound
originality
a
conviction
he
thought
was
needed
to
animate
this
formal
style
which
was
too
frail
to
support
any
thought
that
was
unforseen
or
any
thesis
that
was
audacious
yet
despite
all
this
there
were
several
writers
whose
burning
eloquence
fused
and
shaped
this
language
notably
lacordaire
who
was
one
of
the
few
really
great
writers
the
church
had
produced
for
many
years
immured
like
his
colleagues
in
the
narrow
circle
of
orthodox
speculations
likewise
obliged
to
dissipate
his
energies
in
the
exclusive
consideration
of
those
theories
which
had
been
expressed
and
consecrated
by
the
fathers
of
the
church
and
developed
by
the
masters
of
the
pulpit
he
succeeded
in
inbuing
them
with
novelty
and
in
rejuvenating
almost
in
modifying
them
by
clothing
them
in
a
more
personal
and
stimulating
form
here
and
there
in
his
de
were
treasures
of
expression
audacious
usages
of
words
accents
of
love
rapid
movements
cries
of
joy
and
distracted
effusions
then
to
his
position
as
a
brilliant
and
gentle
monk
whose
ingenuity
and
labors
had
been
exhausted
in
the
impossible
task
of
conciliating
the
liberal
doctrines
of
society
with
the
authoritarian
dogmas
of
the
church
he
added
a
temperament
of
fierce
love
and
suave
diplomatic
tenderness
in
his
letters
to
young
men
may
be
found
the
caressing
inflections
of
a
father
exhorting
his
sons
with
smiling
reprimands
the
advice
and
the
indulgent
forgiveness
some
of
these
des
esseintes
found
charming
confessing
as
they
did
the
monk
yearning
for
affection
while
others
were
even
imposing
when
they
sought
to
sustain
courage
and
dissipate
doubts
by
the
inimitable
certainties
of
faith
in
fine
this
sentiment
of
paternity
which
gave
his
pen
a
delicately
feminine
quality
lent
to
his
prose
a
characteristically
individual
accent
discernible
among
all
the
clerical
literature
after
lacordaire
ecclesiastics
and
monks
possessing
any
individuality
were
extremely
rare
at
the
very
most
a
few
pages
of
his
pupil
the
abbe
peyreyve
merited
reading
he
left
sympathetic
biographies
of
his
master
wrote
a
few
loveable
letters
composed
treatises
in
the
sonorous
language
of
formal
discourse
and
delivered
panegyrics
in
which
the
declamatory
tone
was
too
broadly
stressed
certainly
the
abbe
peyreyve
had
neither
the
emotion
nor
the
ardor
of
lacordaire
he
was
too
much
a
priest
and
too
little
a
man
yet
here
and
there
in
the
rhetoric
of
his
sermons
flashed
interesting
effects
of
large
and
solid
phrasing
or
touches
of
nobility
that
were
almost
venerable
but
to
find
writers
of
prose
whose
works
justify
close
study
one
was
obliged
to
seek
those
who
had
not
submitted
to
ordination
to
the
secular
writers
whom
the
interests
of
catholicism
engaged
and
devoted
to
its
cause
with
the
comte
de
falloux
the
episcopal
style
so
stupidly
handled
by
the
prelates
recruited
new
strength
and
in
a
manner
recovered
its
masculine
vigor
under
his
guise
of
moderation
this
academician
exuded
gall
the
discourse
which
he
delivered
to
parliament
in
was
diffuse
and
abject
but
his
articles
first
printed
in
the
and
since
collected
into
books
were
mordant
and
discerning
under
the
exaggerated
politeness
of
their
form
conceived
as
harangues
they
contained
a
certain
strong
muscular
energy
and
were
astonishing
in
the
intolerance
of
their
convictions
a
dangerous
polemist
because
of
his
ambuscades
a
shrewd
logician
executing
flanking
movements
and
attacking
unexpectedly
the
comte
de
falloux
had
also
written
striking
penetrating
pages
on
the
death
of
madame
swetchine
whose
tracts
he
had
collected
and
whom
he
revered
as
a
saint
but
the
true
temperament
of
the
writer
was
betrayed
in
the
two
brochures
which
appeared
in
and
the
latter
entitled
moved
by
a
cold
rage
the
implacable
legitimist
this
time
fought
openly
contrary
to
his
custom
and
hurled
against
the
infidels
in
the
form
of
a
peroration
such
fulminating
invectives
as
these
and
you
systematic
utopians
who
make
an
abstraction
of
human
nature
fomentors
of

an
outrage

an
abominable

the

bore
the
title

and
was
directed
against
the
despotism
of
the
and
against
veuillot
whose
name
he
refused
to
mention
here
the
sinuous
attacks
were

filtered
beneath

line
when
the
gentleman
clad
in
blue
answered
the
sharp
physical
blows
of

with
scornful
sarcasms
these
contestants
represented
the
two
parties
of
the
church
the
two
factions
whose
differences
were
resolved
into
virulent
hatreds
de

the
more
haughty
and
cunning
belonged
to
the
liberal
camp

already
claimed

subscribed
to
the
principles
of

review
which
attempted
to
cover
the
imperious
theories
of
the
church
with
a
varnish
of
tolerance
veuillot
franker
and
more
open
scorned
such
masks
unhesitatingly
admitted
the
tyranny
of
the
ultramontaine
doctrines
and
confessed
with
a
certain
compunction
the
pitiless
yoke
of
the
church
dogma
for
the
conduct
of
this
verbal
warfare
veuillot
had
made
himself
master
of
a
special
style
partly
borrowed
from
la
bruyere
and
du
this
style
had
the
force
of
a
tomahawk
in
the
hands
of
this
vehement
personality
strangely
headstrong
and
brave
he
had
overwhelmed
both
free
thinkers
and
bishops
with
this
terrible
weapon
charging
at
his
enemies
like
a
bull
regardless
of
the
party
to
which
they
belonged
distrusted
by
the
church
which
would
tolerate
neither
his
contraband
style
nor
his
fortified
theories
he
had
nevertheless
overawed
everybody
by
his
powerful
talent
incurring
the
attack
of
the
entire
press
which
he
effectively
thrashed
in
his
de
coping
with
every
assault
freeing
himself
with
a
kick
of
the
foot
of
all
the
wretched
who
had
presumed
to
attack
him
unfortunately
this
undisputed
talent
only
existed
in
pugilism
at
peace
veuillot
was
no
more
than
a
mediocre
writer
his
poetry
and
novels
were
pitiful
his
language
was
vapid
when
it
was
not
engaged
in
a
striking
controversy
in

he
was
very
difficult
to
understand
des

never
failed
to
be
astonished
by
the
insouciance
of
this
writer
who
spoke
confidently
of

impenetrable

although
he
felt
obliged
to
establish
proof
of
the

he
advanced
with

he
deformed

contradicted
with
greater
impudence
even
than
the
panegyrists

the

averred
that

never

the
esteem
it
had
for

called

impure
miasmas
and
treated
buddhism
and
other
religions
with
such
contempt
that
he
apologized
for
even
soiling
his
catholic
prose
by
onslaught
on
their
doctrines
at
times
religious
passion
breathed
a
certain
ardor
into
his
oratorical
language
under
the
ice
of
which
seethed
a
violent
current
in
his
numerous
writings
on
dante
on
saint
francis
on
the
author
of
on
the
franciscan
poets
on
socialism
on
commercial
law
and
every
imaginable
subject
this
man
pleaded
for
the
defense
of
the
vatican
which
he
held
indefectible
and
judged
causes
and
opinions
according
to
their
harmony
or
discord
with
those
that
he
advanced
this
manner
of

from
a

also
the
method
of
that
literary
scamp

whom
some
people
would
have
made
the
other
rival
the
latter
was
less
bigoted
than
the
master
affected
less
arrogance
and
admitted
more
worldly
pretentions
he
repeatedly
left
the
literary
cloister
in
which
ozanam
had
imprisoned
himself
and
had
read
secular
works
so
as
to
be
able
to
judge
of
them
this
province
he
entered
gropingly
like
a
child
in
a
vault
seeing
nothing
but
shadow
around
him
perceiving
in
this
gloom
only
the
gleam
of
the
candle
which
illumed
the
place
a
few
paces
before
him
in
this
gloom
uncertain
of
his
bearings
he
stumbled
at
every
turn
speaking
of
murger
who
had
the
care
of
a
chiselled
and
carefully
finished
style
of
hugo
who
sought
the
noisome
and
unclean
and
to
whom
he
dared
compare
de
laprade
of
paul
delacroix
who
scorned
the
rules
of
paul
delaroche
and
of
the
poet
reboul
whom
he
praised
because
of
their
apparent
faith
des
esseintes
could
not
restrain
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
before
these
stupid
opinions
covered
by
a
borrowed
prose
whose
already
worn
texture
clung
or
became
torn
at
each
phrase
in
a
different
way
the
works
of
poujoulat
and
genoude
montalembert
nicolas
and
carne
failed
to
inspire
him
with
any
definite
interest
his
taste
for
history
was
not
pronounced
even
when
treated
with
the
scholarly
fidelity
and
harmonious
style
of
the
duc
de
broglie
nor
was
his
penchant
for
the
social
and
religious
questions
even
when
broached
by
henry
cochin
who
revealed
his
true
self
in
a
letter
where
he
gave
a
stirring
account
of
the
taking
of
the
veil
at
the
he
had
not
touched
these
books
for
a
long
time
and
the
period
was
already
remote
when
he
had
thrown
with
his
waste
paper
the
puerile
lucubrations
of
the
gloomy
pontmartin
and
the
pitiful
feval
and
long
since
he
had
given
to
his
servants
for
a
certain
vulgar
usage
the
short
stories
of
aubineau
and
lasserre
in
which
are
recorded
wretched
hagiographies
of
miracles
effected
by
dupont

and
by

in
no
way
did
des

derive
even
a
fugitive
distraction
from
his
boredom
from
this
literature
the
mass

dim
corners
of

insufferable

that
led
from

probably
disgusted
by
the
dullness
of
the
journey
and
the
noisy
mob
of
those
pilgrims

for
centuries
followed
one
after
the

upon
the

highway
marching
in

stopping
at

exchange
the

had
departed
through
the
byways
to
wander
in
the
gloomy
glade

tarried
long
to
recover
his
breath
before
continuing
on

way
and
going
even
farther
in
the
regions
of
human
thought

jansenist

he
derided

and

the
piercing
cunning
of
his
analysis

to

the
sharp
probing
investigations
of

of
the
infidel
psychologists
of
the
preceding
and
present
century
in
him
was
a
sort
of
catholic
duranty
but
more
dogmatic
and
penetrating
an
experienced
manipulation
of
the
magnifying
glass
a
sophisticated
engineer
of
the
soul
a
skillful
watchmaker
of
the
brain
delighting

examine
the
mechanism
of
a
passion
and
elucidate
it
by
details

in
this
oddly
formed
mind
existed
unsurmised
relationships
of
thoughts
harmonies
and
oppositions
furthermore
he
affected
a
wholly
novel
manner
of
action
which
used
the
etymology
of
words
as
a
for
ideas
whose
associations
sometimes
became
tenuous
but
which
almost
constantly
remained
ingenious
and
sparkling
thus
despite
the
awkwardness
of
his
structure
he
dissected
with
a
singular
perspicacity
the
the
ordinary
man
and
the
passion
of
unhappiness
revealing
meanwhile
interesting
comparisons
which
could
be
constructed
between
the
operations
of

and
of
memory
but
such
skill
in
handling
this
perfected
instrument
of
analysis
stolen
from
the
enemies
of
the
church
represented
only
one
of
the
temperamental
phases
of
this
man
still
another

this
mind
divided
itself
in
two
parts
and
revealed
besides
the
writer
the
religious
fanatic
and
biblical
prophet
like

whom
he
now
and
again
recalled
in
distortions
of
phrases
and
words
ernest

had
delighted
in
imitating
saint
john
of

he
pontificated
and
vaticinated
from
his
retreat
in
the
rue
haranguing
the
reader
with
an
apocalyptic
language
partaking
in
spots
of
the
bitterness
of
an
isaiah
he
affected
inordinate
pretentions
of
profundity
there
were
some
fawning
and
complacent
people
who
pretended
to
consider
him
a
great
man
the
reservoir
of
learning
the
encyclopedic
giant
of
the
age
perhaps
he
was
a
well
but
one
at
whose
bottom
one
often
could
not
find
a
drop
of
water
in

volume

paraphrased
the
holy

endeavoring
to
complicate
their
ordinarily
obvious
sense

in
his
brochure

written
in
a
biblical
style
rugged
and
obscure
he
sought
to
appear
like
a
vengeful
apostle
prideful
and
tormented
with
spleen
but
showed
himself
a
deacon
touched
with
a
mystic
epilepsy
or
like
a
talented

a
surly
and
bitter
sectarian
but
thought
des

this
sickly
shamelessness
often
obstructed
the
inventive
sallies
of

casuist
with
more
intolerance
than
even

he
resolutely
denied
all
that
pertained
to
his
clan
proclaimed
the
most
disconcerting
axioms
maintained
with
a
disconcerting
authority
that
geology
is
returning
toward
moses
and
that
natural
history
like
chemistry
and
every
contemporary
science
verifies
the
scientific
truth
of
the
bible
the
proposition
on
each
page
was
of
the
unique
truth
and
the
superhuman
knowledge
of
the
church
and
everywhere
were
interspersed
more
than
perilous
aphorisms
and
raging
curses
cast
at
the
art
of
the
last
century
to
this
strange
mixture
was
added
the
love
of
sanctimonious
delights
such
as
a
translation
of
the
by
angele
de
foligno
a
book
of
an
unparalleled
fluid
stupidity
with
selected
works
of
jean
rusbrock
a
mystic
of
the
thirteenth
century
whose
prose
offered
an
incomprehensible
but
alluring
combination
of
dusky
exaltations
caressing
effusions
and
poignant
transports
the
whole
attitude
of
this
presumptuous
pontiff
hello
had
leaped
from
a
preface
written
for
this
book
he
himself
remarked
that
extraordinary
things
can
only
be
stammered
and
he
stammered
in
good
truth
declaring
that
the
holy
gloom
where
rusbrock
extends
his
eagle
wings
is
his
ocean
his
prey
his
glory
and
for
such
as
him
the
far
horizons
would
be
a
too
narrow
garment
however
this
might
be
des

felt
himself
intrigued
toward
this
but
subtile
mind
no
fusion
had
been
effected
between
the
skilful
psychologist
and
the
pious
pedant
and
the
very
jolts
and
incoherencies
constituted
the
personality
of
the
man
with
him
was
recruited
the
little
group
of
writers
who
fought
on
the
front
battle
line
of
the
clerical
camp
they
did
not
belong
to
the
regular
army
but
were
more
properly
the
scouts
of
a
religion
which
distrusted
men
of
such
talent
as
veuillot
and
hello
because
they
did
not
seem
sufficiently
submissive
and
shallow
what
the
church
really
desires
is
soldiers
who
do
not
reason
files
of
such
blind
combatants
and
such
mediocrities
as
hello
describes
with
the
rage
of
one
who
has
submitted
to
their
yoke
thus
it
was
that
catholicism
had
lost
no
time
in
driving
away
one
of
its
partisans
an
enraged
pamphleteer
who
wrote
in
a
style
at
once
rare
and
exasperated
the
savage
leon
bloy
and
caused
to
be
cast
from
the
doors
of
its
bookshops
as
it
would
a
plague
or
a
filthy
vagrant
another
writer
who
had
made
himself
hoarse
with
celebrating
its
praises
barbey
it
is
true
that
the
latter
was
too
prone
to
compromise
and
not
sufficiently
docile
others
bent
their
heads
under
rebukes
and
returned
to
the
ranks
but
he
was
the
and
was
unrecognized
by
the
party
in
a
literary
way
he
pursued
women
whom
he
dragged
into
the
sanctuary
nay
even
that
vast
disdain
was
invoked
with
which
catholicism
enshrouds
talent
to
prevent
excommunication
from
putting
beyond
the
pale
of
the
law
a
perplexing
servant
who
under
pretext
of
honoring
his
masters
broke
the
window
panes
of
the
chapel
juggled
with
the
holy
pyxes
and
executed
eccentric
dances
around
the
tabernacle
two
works
of
barbey
specially
attracted
des
esseintes
the
and
the
others
such
as
the
the
des
and
vieille
were
certainly
more
comprehensive
and
more
finely
balanced
but
they
left
des
esseintes
untouched
for
he
was
really
interested
only
in
unhealthy
works
which
were
consumed
and
irritated
by
fever
in
these
all
but
healthy
volumes
barbey
constantly
hesitated
between
those
two
pits
which
the
catholic
religion
succeeds
in
reconciling
mysticism
and
sadism
in
these
two
books
which
des
esseintes
was
thumbing
barbey
had
lost
all
prudence
given
full
rein
to
his
steed
and
galloped
at
full
speed
over
roads
to
their
farthest
limits
all
the
mysterious
horror
of
the
middle
ages
hovered
over
that
improbable
book
the
magic
blended
with
religion
black
magic
with
prayer
and
more
pitiless
and
savage
than
the
devil
himself
the
god
of
original
sin
incessantly
tortured
the
innocent
calixte
his
reprobate
as
once
he
had
caused
one
of
his
angels
to
mark
the
houses
of
unbelievers
whom
he
wished
to
slay
conceived
by
a
fasting
monk
in
the
grip
of
delirium
these
scenes
were
unfolded
in
the
uneven
style
of
a
tortured
soul
unfortunately
among
those
disordered
creatures
that
were
like
galvanized
coppelias
of
hoffmann
some
like
neel
de
nehou
seemed
to
have
been
imagined
in
moments
of
exhaustion
following
convulsions
and
were
discordant
notes
in
this
harmony
of
sombre
madness
where
they
were
as
comical
and
ridiculous
as
a
tiny
zinc
figure
playing
on
a
horn
on
a
timepiece
after
these
mystic
divagations
the
writer
had
experienced
a
period
of
calm
then
a
terrible
relapse
followed
this
belief
that
man
is
a
buridanesque
donkey
a
being
balanced
between
two
forces
of
equal
attraction
which
successively
remain
victorious
and
vanquished
this
conviction
that
human
life
is
only
an
uncertain
combat
waged
between
hell
and
heaven
this
faith
in
two
opposite
beings
satan
and
christ
was
fatally
certain
to
engender
such
inner
discords
of
the
soul
exalted
by
incessant
struggle
excited
at
once
by
promises
and
menaces
and
ending
by
abandoning
itself
to
whichever
of
the
two
forces
persisted
in
the
pursuit
the
more
relentlessly
in
the
barbey
sang
the
praises
of
christ
who
had
prevailed
against
temptations
in
the
the
author
succumbed
to
the
devil
whom
he
celebrated
then
appeared
sadism
that
bastard
of
catholicism
which
through
the
centuries
religion
has
relentlessly
pursued
with
its
exorcisms
and
stakes
this
condition
at
once
fascinating
and
ambiguous
can
not
arise
in
the
soul
of
an
unbeliever
it
does
not
merely
consist
in
sinking
oneself
in
the
excesses
of
the
flesh
excited
by
outrageous
blasphemies
for
in
such
a
case
it
would
be
no
more
than
a
case
of
satyriasis
that
had
reached
its
climax
before
all
it
consists
in
sacrilegious
practice
in
moral
rebellion
in
spiritual
debauchery
in
a
wholly
ideal
aberration
and
in
this
it
is
exemplarily
christian
it
also
is
founded
upon
a
joy
tempered
by
fear
a
joy
analogous
to
the
satisfaction
of
children
who
disobey
their
parents
and
play
with
forbidden
things
for
no
reason
other
than
that
they
had
been
forbidden
to
do
so
in
fact
if
it
did
not
admit
of
sacrilege
sadism
would
have
no
reason
for
existence
besides
the
sacrilege
proceeding
from
the
very
existence
of
a
religion
can
only
be
intentionally
and
pertinently
performed
by
a
believer
for
no
one
would
take
pleasure
in
profaning
a
faith
that
was
indifferent
or
unknown
to
him
the
power
of
sadism
and
the
attraction
it
presents
lies
entirely
then
in
the
prohibited
enjoyment
of
transferring
to
satan
the
praises
and
prayers
due
to
god
it
lies
in
the
of
catholic
precepts
which
one
really
follows
unwillingly
by
committing
in
deeper
scorn
of
christ
those
sins
which
the
church
has
especially
cursed
such
as
pollution
of
worship
and
carnal
orgy
in
its
elements
this
phenomenon
to
which
the
marquis
de
sade
has
bequeathed
his
name
is
as
old
as
the
church
it
had
reared
its
head
in
the
eighteenth
century
recalling
to
go
back
no
farther
by
a
simple
phenomenon
of
atavism
the
impious
practices
of
the
sabbath
the
witches
revels
of
the
middle
ages
by
having
consulted
the
that
terrible
code
of
jacob
sprenger
which
permits
the
church
wholesale
burnings
of
necromancers
and
sorcerers
des
esseintes
recognized
in
the
sabbath
all
the
obscene
practices
and
all
the
blasphemies
of
sadism
in
addition
to
the
unclean
scenes
beloved
by
malin
the
nights
successively
and
lawfully
consecrated
to
excessive
sensual
orgies
and
devoted
to
the
bestialities
of
passion
he
once
more
discovered
the
parody
of
the
processions
the
insults
and
eternal
threats
levelled
at
god
and
the
devotion
bestowed
upon
his
rival
while
amid
cursing
of
the
wine
and
the
bread
the
black
mass
was
being
celebrated
on
the
back
of
a
woman
on
all
fours
whose
stained
bare
thighs
served
as
the
altar
from
which
the
congregation
received
the
communion
from
a
black
goblet
stamped
with
an
image
of
a
goat
this
profusion
of
impure
mockeries
and
foul
shames
were
marked
in
the
career
of
the
marquis
de
sade
who
garnished
his
terrible
pleasures
with
outrageous
sacrileges
he
cried
out
to
the
sky
invoked
lucifer
shouted
his
contempt
of
god
calling
him
rogue
and
imbecile
spat
upon
the
communion
endeavored
to
contaminate
with
vile
ordures
a
divinity
who
he
prayed
might
damn
him
the
while
he
declared
to
defy
him
the
more
that
he
did
not
exist
barbey
approached
this
psychic
state
if
he
did
not
presume
as
far
as
de
sade
in
uttering
atrocious
curses
against
the
saviour
if
more
prudent
or
more
timid
he
claimed
ever
to
honor
the
church
he
none
the
less
addressed
his
suit
to
the
devil
as
was
done
in
medieval
times
and

demoniac

borrowing

episode

he
seasoned
with
new
condiments
when
he
wrote
the

this
extravagant
book

he
had
caused
to
be
printed
in

in

a

parchment

the

and
devout
toward
which
catholicism
often
thrust

the
line
of
religious
writers
and
in
truth
that
pariah
belonged
more
from
every
point
of
view
to
secular
literature
than
to
the
other
with
which
he
demanded
a
place
that
was
denied
him
his
language
was
the
language
of
disheveled
romanticism
full
of
involved
expressions
unfamiliar
turns
of
speech
delighted
with
extravagant
comparisons
and
with
whip
strokes
and
phrases
which
exploded
like

bells
along

was
like
a

among

of

des

reflected
in
this
wise
while
here
and
there
several
passages
of
the
book
and
comparing
its
nervous
and
changing
style
with
the
fixed
manner
of
other
church
writers
he
thought
of
the
evolution
of
language
which
darwin
has
so
truly
revealed
compelled
to
live
in
a
secular
atmosphere
raised
in
the
heart
of
the
romantic
school
constantly
being
in
the
current
of
modern
literature
and
accustomed
to
reading
contemporary
publications
barbey
had
acquired
a
dialect
which
although
it
had
sustained
numerous
and
profound
changes
since
the
great
age
had
nevertheless
renewed
itself
in
his
works
the
ecclesiastical
writers
on
the
contrary
confined
within
specific
limitations
restricted
to
ancient
church
literature
knowing
nothing
of
the
literary

of
the
centuries
and
determined

eyes

more
surely
not
to

constrained
to
the
use
of
an
inflexible
language
like
that
of
the
eighteenth
century
which
descendants
of
the
french
who
settled
in
canada
still
speak
and
write
today
without
change
of
phrasing
or
words
having
succeeded
in
preserving
their
original
idiom
by
isolation
in
certain
metropolitan
centres
despite
the
fact
that
they
are
enveloped
upon
every
side
by
peoples
meanwhile
the
silvery
sound
of
a
clock
that
tolled

angelus
announced
breakfast
time
to
des

he
abandoned
his
books
pressed
his
brow
and
went
to
the
dining
room
saying
to
himself
that
among
all
the
volumes
he
had
just
arranged
the
works
of
barbey
were
the
only
ones
whose
ideas
and
style
offered
the
gaminess
he
so
loved
to
savor
in
the
latin
and
decadent
monastic
writers
of
past
ages
chapter
as
the
season
advanced
the
weather
far
from
improving
grew
worse
everything
seemed
to
go
wrong
that
year
after
the
squalls
and
mists
the
sky
was
covered
with
a
white
expanse
of
heat
like
plates
of
sheet
iron
in
two
days
without
transition
a
torrid
heat
an
atmosphere
of
frightful
heaviness
succeeded
the
damp
cold
of
foggy
days
and
the
streaming
of
the
rains
as
though
stirred
by
furious
pokers
the
sun
showed
like
a
darting
a
light
almost
burning
one
face
a
hot
dust
rose
from
the
roads
scorching
the
dry
trees
and
the
yellowed
lawns
became
a
deep
brown
a
temperature
like
that
of
a
foundry
hung
over
the
dwelling
of
des
esseintes
half
naked
he
opened
a
window
and
received
the
air
like
a
furnace
blast
in
his
face
the
dining
room
to
which
he
fled
was
fiery
and
the
rarefied
air
simmered
utterly
distressed
he
sat
down
for
the
stimulation
that
had
seized
him
had
ended
since
the
close
of
his
reveries
like
all
people
tormented
by
nervousness
heat
distracted
him
and
his
anaemia
checked
by
cold
weather
again
became
pronounced
weakening
his
body
which
had
been
debilitated
by
copious
perspiration
the
back
of
his
shirt
was
saturated
his
perinaeum
was
damp
his
feet
and
arms
moist
his
brow
overflowing
with
sweat
that
ran
down
his
cheeks
des
esseintes
reclined
annihilated
on
a
chair
the
sight
of
the
meat
placed
on
the
table
at
that
moment
caused
his
stomach
to
rise
he
ordered
the
food
removed
asked
for
boiled
eggs
and
tried
to
swallow
some
bread
soaked
in
eggs
but
his
stomach
would
have
none
of
it
a
fit
of
nausea
overcame
him
he
drank
a
few
drops
of
wine
that
pricked
his
stomach
like
points
of
fire
he
wet
his
face
the
perspiration
alternately
warm
and
cold
coursed
along
his
temples
he
began
to
suck
some
pieces
of
ice
to
overcome
his
troubled
heart
but
in
vain
so
weak
was
he
that
he
leaned
against
the
table
he
rose
feeling
the
need
of
air
but
the
bread
had
slowly
risen
in
his
gullet
and
remained
there
never
had
he
felt
so
distressed
so
shattered
so
ill
at
ease
to
add
to
his
discomfort
his
eyes
distressed
him
and
he
saw
objects
in
double
soon
he
lost
his
sense
of
distance
and
his
glass
seemed
to
be
a
league
away
he
told
himself
that
he
was
the
of
sensorial
illusions
and
that
he
was
incapable
of
reacting
he
stretched
out
on
a
couch
but
instantly
he
was
cradled
as
by
the
tossing
of
a
moving
ship
and
the
affection
of
his
heart
increased
he
rose
to
his
feet
determined
to
rid
himself
by
means
of
a
digestive
of
the
food
which
was
choking
him
he
again
reached
the
dining
room
and
sadly
compared
himself
in
this
cabin
to
passengers
seized
with
stumbling
he
made
his
way
to
the
closet
examined
the
mouth
organ
without
opening
any
of
the
stops
but
instead
took
from
a
high
shelf
a
bottle
of
benedictine
which
he
kept
because
of
its
form
which
to
him
seemed
suggestive
of
thoughts
that
were
at
once
gently
wanton
and
vaguely
mystic
but
at
this
moment
he
remained
indifferent
gazing
with
staring
eyes
at
this
squat
bottle
which
at
other
times
had
brought
before
him
images
of
the
medieval
priories
by
its
monkish
paunch
its
head
and
neck
covered
with
a
parchment
hood
its
red
wax
stamp
quartered
with
three
silver
mitres
against
a
field
of
azure
and
fastened
at
the
neck
like
a
papal
bull
with
bands
of
lead
its
label
inscribed
in
sonorous
latin
on
paper
that
seemed
to
have
yellowed
with
age
monachorum
benedictinorum
abbatiae
under
this
thoroughly
abbatial
robe
signed
with
a
cross
and
the
ecclesiastic
initials
pressed
in
between
its
parchments
and
ligatures
slept
an
exquisitely
fine
liquid
it
breathed
an
aroma
that
seemed
the
quintessence
of
angelica
and
hyssop
blended
with
and
of
iodines
and
bromes
hidden
in
sweet
essences
and
it
stimulated
the
palate
with
a
spiritous
ardor
concealed
under
a
virginal
daintiness
and
charmed
the
sense
of
smell
by
a
pungency
enveloped
in
a
caress
innocent
and
devout
this
deceit
which
resulted
from
the
extraordinary
disharmony
between
contents
and
container
between
the
liturgic
form
of
the
flask
and
its
so
feminine
and
modern
soul
had
formerly
stimulated
des
esseintes
to
revery
and
facing
the
bottle
he
was
inclined
to
think
at
great
length
of
the
monks
who
sold
it
the
benedictines
of
the
abbey
of
fecamp
who
belonging
to
the
brotherhood
of
which
had
been
celebrated
for
its
controversial
works
under
the
rule
of
saint
benoit
followed
neither
the
observances
of
the
white
monks
of
citeaux
nor
of
the
black
monks
of
cluny
he
could
not
but
think
of
them
as
being
like
their
brethren
of
the
middle
ages
cultivating
simples
heating
retorts
and
distilling
faultless
panaceas
and
prescriptions
he
tasted
a
drop
of
this
liquor
and
for
a
few
moments
had
relief
but
soon
the
fire
which
the
dash
of
wine
had
lit
in
his
bowels
revived
he
threw
down
his
napkin
returned
to
his
study
and
paced
the
floor
he
felt
as
if
he
were
under
a
pneumatic
clock
and
a
numbing
weakness
stole
from
his
brain
through
his
limbs
unable
to
endure
it
longer
he
betook
himself
to
the
garden
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
done
this
since
his
arrival
at
fontenay
there
he
found
shelter
beneath
a
tree
which
radiated
a
circle
of
shadow
seated
on
the
lawn
he
looked
around
with
a
besotted
air
at
the
square
beds
of
vegetables
planted
by
the
servants
he
gazed
but
it
was
only
at
the
end
of
an
hour
that
he
really
saw
them
for
a
greenish
film
floated
before
his
eyes
permitting
him
only
to
see
as
in
the
depths
of
water
flickering
images
of
shifting
tones
but
when
he
recovered
his
balance
he
clearly
distinguished
the
onions
and
cabbages
a
garden
bed
of
lettuce
further
off
and
in
the
distance
along
the
hedge
a
row
of
white
lillies
recumbent
in
the
heavy
air
a
smile
played
on
his
lips
for
he
suddenly
recalled
the
strange
comparison
of
old
nicandre
who
likened
in
the
point
of
form
the
pistils
of
lillies
to
the
genital
organs
of
a
donkey
and
he
recalled
also
a
passage
from
albert
le
grand
in
which
that
thaumaturgist
describes
a
strange
way
of
discovering
whether
a
girl
is
still
a
virgin
by
means
of
a
lettuce
these
remembrances
distracted
him
somewhat
he
examined
the
garden
interesting
himself
in
the
plants
withered
by
the
heat
and
in
the
hot
ground
whose
vapors
rose
into
the
dusty
air
then
above
the
hedge
which
separated
the
garden
below
from
the
embankment
leading
to
the
fort
he
watched
the
urchins
struggling
and
tumbling
on
the
ground
he
was
concentrating
his
attention
upon
them
when
another
younger
sorry
little
specimen
appeared
he
had
hair
like
seaweed
covered
with
sand
two
green
bubbles
beneath
his
nose
and
disgusting
lips
surrounded
by
a
dirty
white
frame
formed
by
a
slice
of
bread
smeared
with
cheese
and
filled
with
pieces
of
scallions
des
esseintes
inhaled
the
air
a
perverse
appetite
seized
him
this
dirty
slice
made
his
mouth
water
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
stomach
refusing
all
other
nourishment
could
digest
this
shocking
food
and
that
his
palate
would
enjoy
it
as
though
it
were
a
feast
he
leaped
up
ran
to
the
kitchen
and
ordered
a
loaf
white
cheese
and
green
onions
to
be
brought
from
the
village
emphasizing
his
desire
for
a
slice
exactly
like
the
one
being
eaten
by
the
child
then
he
returned
to
sit
beneath
the
tree
the
little
chaps
were
fighting
with
one
another
they
struggled
for
bits
of
bread
which
they
shoved
into
their
cheeks
meanwhile
sucking
their
fingers
kicks
and
blows
rained
freely
and
the
weakest
trampled
upon
cried
out
at
this
sight
des
esseintes
recovered
his
animation
the
interest
he
took
in
this
fight
distracted
his
thoughts
from
his
illness
contemplating
the
blind
fury
of
these
urchins
he
thought
of
the
cruel
and
abominable
law
of
the
struggle
of
existence
and
although
these
children
were
mean
he
could
not
help
being
interested
in
their
futures
yet
could
not
but
believe
that
it
had
been
better
for
them
had
their
mothers
never
given
them
birth
in
fact
all
they
could
expect
of
life
was
rash
colic
fever
and
measles
in
their
earliest
years
slaps
in
the
face
and
degrading
drudgeries
up
to
thirteen
years
deceptions
by
women
sicknesses
and
infidelity
during
manhood
and
toward
the
last
infirmities
and
agonies
in
a
poorhouse
or
asylum
and
the
future
was
the
same
for
every
one
and
none
in
his
good
senses
could
envy
his
neighbor
the
rich
had
the
same
passions
the
same
anxieties
the
same
pains
and
the
same
illnesses
but
in
a
different
environment
the
same
mediocre
enjoyments
whether
alcoholic
literary
or
carnal
there
was
even
a
vague
compensation
in
evils
a
sort
of
justice
which
the
balance
of
misfortune
between
the
classes
permitting
the
poor
to
bear
physical
suffering
more
easily
and
making
it
difficult
for
the
unresisting
weaker
bodies
of
the
rich
to
withstand
it
how
vain
silly
and
mad
it
is
to
beget
brats
and
des

of
those
ecclesiastics
who
had
taken
vows
of
sterility
yet
were
so
inconsistent
as
to
canonize

vincent
de
paul
because
he
brought
vain
tortures
to
innocent
creatures
by
means
of
his
hateful
precautions
vincent
de
paul
had
deferred
for
years
the
death
of
unintelligent
and
insensate
beings
in
such
a
way
that
when
they
later
became
almost
intelligent
and
sentient
to
grief
they
were
able
to
anticipate
the
future
to
await
and
fear
that
death
of
whose
very
name
they
had
of
late
been
ignorant
some
of
them
going
as
far
to
invoke
it
in
hatred
of
that
sentence
of
life
which
the
monk
inflicted
upon
them
by
an
absurd
theological
code
and
since
this
old
man
death
his
ideas
had
prevailed
abandoned
children
were
sheltered
instead
of
being
killed
and
yet
their
lives
daily
became
increasingly
rigorous
and
barren
then
under
pretext
of
liberty
and
progress
society
had
discovered
another
means
of
increasing
man
miseries
by
tearing
him
from
his
home
forcing
him
to
don
a
ridiculous
uniform
and
carry
weapons
by
brutalizing
him
in
a
slavery
in
every
respect
like
that
from
which
he
had
compassionately
freed
the
negro
and
all
to
enable
him
to
slaughter
his
neighbor
without
risking
the
scaffold
like
ordinary
murderers
who
operate
without
uniforms
and
with
weapons
that
are
less
swift
and
deafening
des

wondered
if
there
had
ever
been
such
a
time
as
ours
our
age
invokes
the
causes
of
humanity
endeavors
to
perfect
anaesthesia
to
suppress
physical
suffering
yet
at
the
same
time
it
prepares
these
very
stimulants
to
increase
moral
wretchedness
ah
if
ever
this
useless
procreation
should
be
abolished
it
were
now
but
here
again
the
laws
enacted
by
men
like
portalis
and
homais
appeared
strange
and
cruel
in
the
matter
of
generation
justice
finds
the
agencies
for
deception
to
be
quite
natural
it
is
a
recognized
and
acknowledged
fact
there
is
scarcely
a
home
of
any
station
that
does
not
confide
its
children
to
the
drain
pipes
or
that
does
not
employ
contrivances
that
are
freely
sold
and
which
it
would
enter
no
person
mind
to
prohibit
and
yet
if
these
subterfuges
proved
insufficient
if
the
attempt
miscarried
and
if
to
remedy
matters
one
had
recourse
to
more
efficacious
measures
ah
then
there
were
not
prisons
enough
not
municipal
jails
enough
to
confine
those
who
in
good
faith
were
condemned
by
other
individuals
who
had
that
very
evening
on
the
conjugal
bed
done
their
utmost
to
avoid
giving
birth
to
children
the
deceit
itself
was
not
a
crime
it
seemed
the
crime
lay
in
the
justification
of
the
deceit
what
society
considered
a
crime
was
the
act
of
killing
a
being
endowed
with
life
and
yet
in
expelling
a
foetus
one
destroyed
an
animal
that
was
less
formed
and
living
and
certainly
less
intelligent
and
more
ugly
than
a
dog
or
a
cat
although
it
is
permissible
to
strangle
these
creatures
as
soon
as
they
are
born
it
is
only
right
to
add
for
the
sake
of
fairness
thought
des
esseintes
that
it
is
not
the
awkward
man
who
generally
loses
no
time
in
disappearing
but
rather
the
woman
the
victim
of
his
stupidity
who
expiates
the
crime
of
having
saved
an
innocent
life
yet
was
it
right
that
the
world
should
be
filled
with
such
prejudice
as
to
wish
to
repress
manoeuvres
so
natural
that
primitive
man

savage

instance

the

interrupted
the
charitable
reflections
of

who
received
the
slice
of
bread
on
a
plate
of
vermeil
pains
shot
through
his
heart
he
did
not
have
the
courage
to
eat
this
bread
for
the
unhealthy
excitement
of
his
stomach
had
ceased
a
sensation
of
frightful
decay
swept
upon
him
he
was
compelled
to
rise
the
sun
turned
and
slowly
fell
upon
the
place
that
he
had
lately
occupied
the
heat
became
more
heavy
and
fierce
throw
this
slice
of
bread
to
those
children
who
are
murdering
each
other
on
the
road
he
ordered
his
servant
let
the
weakest
be
crippled
be
denied
share
in
the
prize
and
be
soundly
thrashed
into
the
bargain
as
they
will
be
when
they
return
to
their
homes
with
torn
trousers
and
bruised
eyes
this
will
give
them
an
idea
of
the
life
that
awaits
them
and
he
entered
the
house
and
sank
into
his
armchair
but
i
must
try
to
eat
something
he
said
and
he
attempted
to
soak
a
biscuit
in
old
constantia
wine
several
bottles
of
which
remained
in
his
cellar
that
wine
the
color
of
slightly
burned
onions
partaking
of
malaga
and
port
but
with
a
specially
luscious
flavor
and
an
of
grapes
dried
by
fiery
suns
had
often
comforted
him
given
a
new
energy
to
his
stomach
weakened
by
the
fasts
which
he
was
forced
to
undergo
but
this
cordial
usually
so
efficacious
now
failed
then
he
thought
that
an
emollient
might
perhaps
counteract
the
fiery
pains
which
were
consuming
him
and
he
took
out
the
nalifka
a
russian
liqueur
contained
in
a
bottle
frosted
with
unpolished
glass
this
unctuous
syrup
also
failed
alas
the
time
was
far
off
when
enjoying
good
health
des
esseintes
had
ridden
to
his
house
in
the
hot
summer
days
in
a
sleigh
and
there
covered
with
furs
wrapped
about
his
chest
forced
himself
to
shiver
saying
as
he
listened
attentively
to
the
chattering
of
his
teeth
ah
how
biting
this
wind
is
it
is
freezing
thus
he
had
almost
succeeded
in
convincing
himself
that
it
was
cold
unfortunately
such
remedies
as
these
had
failed
of
their
purpose
ever
since
his
sickness
became
vital
with
all
this
he
was
unable
to
make
use
of
laudanum
instead
of
allaying
the
pain
this
sedative
irritated
him
even
to
the
degree
of
depriving
him
of
rest
at
one
time
he
had
endeavored
to
procure
visions
through
opium
and
hashish
but
these
two
substances
had
led
to
vomitings
and
intense
nervous
disturbances
he
had
instantly
been
forced
to
give
up
the
idea
of
taking
them
and
without
the
aid
of
these
coarse
stimulants
demand
of
his
brain
alone
to
transport
him
into
the
land
of
dreams
far
far
from
life
what
a
day
he
said
to
himself
sponging
his
neck
feeling
every
ounce
of
his
strength
dissolve
in
perspiration
a
feverish
agitation
still
prevented
him
from
remaining
in
one
spot
once
more
he
walked
up
and
down
trying
every
chair
in
the
room
in
turn
wearied
of
the
struggle
at
last
he
fell
against
his
bureau
and
leaning
mechanically
against
the
table
without
thinking
of
anything
he
touched
an
astrolabe
which
rested
on
a
mass
of
books
and
notes
and
served
as
a
paper
weight
he
had
purchased
this
engraved
and
gilded
copper
instrument
it
had
come
from
germany
and
dated
from
the
seventeenth
century
of
a
paris
dealer
after
a
visit
to
the
cluny
museum
where
he
had
stood
for
a
long
while
in
ecstatic
admiration
before
a
marvelous
astrolabe
made
of
chiseled
ivory
whose
cabalistic
appearance
enchanted
him
this
paper
weight
evoked
many
reminiscences
within
him
aroused
and
actuated
by
the
appearance
of
this
trinket
his
thoughts
rushed
from
fontenay
to
paris
to
the
curio
shop
where
he
had
purchased
it
then
returned
to
the
museum
and
he
mentally
beheld
the
ivory
astrolabe
while
his
unseeing
eyes
continued
to
gaze
upon
the
copper
astrolabe
on
the
table
then
he
left
the
museum
and
without
quitting
the
town
strolled
down
the
streets
wandered
through
the
rue
du
sommerard
and
the
boulevard
branched
off
into
the
neighboring
streets
and
paused
before
certain
shops
whose
quite
extraordinary
appearance
and
profusion
had
often
attracted
him
beginning
with
an
astrolabe
this
spiritual
jaunt
ended
in
the
cafes
of
the
latin
quarter
he
remembered
how
these
places
were
crowded
in
the
rue
and
at
the
end
of
the
rue
de
vaugirard
touching
the
odeon
sometimes
they
followed
one
another
like
the
old
of
the
at
antwerp
each
of
which
revealed
a
front
the
counterpart
of
its
neighbor
through
the
doors
and
the
windows
dimmed
with
colored
panes
or
curtains
he
had
often
seen
women
who
walked
about
like
geese
others
on
benches
rested
their
elbows
on
the
marble
tables
humming
their
temples
resting
between
their
hands
still
others
strutted
and
posed
in
front
of
mirrors
playing
with
their
false
hair
pomaded
by
others
again
took
money
from
their
purses
and
methodically
sorted
the
different
denominations
in
little
heaps
most
of
them
had
heavy
features
hoarse
voices
flabby
necks
and
painted
eyes
and
all
of
them
like
automatons
moved
simultaneously
upon
the
same
impulse
flung
the
same
enticements
with
the
same
tone
and
uttered
the
identical
queer
words
the
same
odd
inflections
and
the
same
smile
certain
ideas
associated
themselves
in
the
mind
of
des
esseintes
whose
reveries
came
to
an
end
now
that
he
recalled
this
collection
of
and
streets
he
understood
the
significance
of
those
cafes
which
reflected
the
state
of
soul
of
an
entire
generation
and
from
it
he
discovered
the
synthesis
of
the
period
and
in
fact
the
symptoms
were
certain
and
obvious
the
houses
of
prostitution
disappeared
and
as
soon
as
one
of
them
closed
a
cafe
began
to
operate
this
restriction
of
prostitution
which
proved
profitable
to
clandestine
loves
evidently
arose
from
the
incomprehensible
illusions
of
men
in
the
matter
of
carnal
life
monstrous
as
it
may
appear
these
haunts
satisfied
an
ideal
although
the
utilitarian
tendencies
transmitted
by
heredity
and
developed
by
the
precocious
rudeness
and
constant
brutalities
of
the
colleges
had
made
the
youth
of
the
day
strangely
crude
and
as
strangely
positive
and
cold
it
had
none
the
less
preserved
in
the
back
of
their
heads
an
old
blue
flower
an
old
ideal
of
a
vague
sour
affection
today
when
the
blood
clamored
youths
could
not
bring
themselves
to
go
through
the
formality
of
entering
ending
paying
and
leaving
in
their
eyes
this
was
bestiality
the
action
of
a
dog
attacking
a
bitch
without
much
ado
then
too
vanity
fled
unsatisfied
from
these
houses
where
there
was
no
semblance
of
resistance
there
was
no
victory
no
hoped
for
preference
nor
even
largess
obtained
from
the
tradeswoman
who
measured
her
caresses
according
to
the
price
on
the
contrary
the
courting
of
a
girl
of
the
cafes
stimulated
all
the
susceptibilities
of
love
all
the
refinements
of
sentiment
one
disputed
with
the
others
for
such
a
girl
and
those
to
whom
she
granted
a
rendezvous
in
consideration
of
much
money
were
sincere
in
imagining
that
they
had
won
her
from
a
rival
and
in
so
thinking
they
were
the
objects
of
honorary
distinction
and
favor
yet
this
domesticity
was
as
stupid
as
selfish
as
vile
as
that
of
houses
of
its
creatures
drank
without
being
thirsty
laughed
without
reason
were
charmed
by
the
caresses
of
a
slut
quarrelled
and
fought
for
no
reason
whatever
despite
everything
the
parisian
youth
had
not
been
able
to
see
that
these
girls
were
from
the
point
of
plastic
beauty
graceful
attitudes
and
necessary
attire
quite
inferior
to
the
women
in
the
bawdy
houses
my
god
des
esseintes
exclaimed
what
ninnies
are
these
fellows
who
flutter
around
the
cafes
for
over
and
above
their
silly
illusions
they
forget
the
danger
of
degraded
suspicious
allurements
and
they
are
unaware
of
the
sums
of
money
given
for
affairs
priced
in
advance
by
the
mistress
of
the
time
lost
in
waiting
for
an
assignation
deferred
so
as
to
increase
its
value
and
cost
delays
which
are
repeated
to
provide
more
tips
for
the
waiters
this
imbecile
sentimentality
combined
with
a
ferociously
practical
sense
represented
the
dominant
motive
of
the
age
these
very
persons
who
would
have
gouged
their
neighbors
eyes
to
gain
ten
lost
all
presence
of
mind
and
discrimination
before
suspicious
looking
girls
in
restaurants
who
pitilessly
harassed
and
relentlessly
fleeced
them
fathers
devoted
their
lives
to
their
businesses
and
labors
families
devoured
one
another
on
the
pretext
of
trade
only
to
be
robbed
by
their
sons
who
in
turn
allowed
themselves
to
be
fleeced
by
women
who
posed
as
sweethearts
to
obtain
their
money
in
all
paris
from
east
to
west
and
from
north
to
south
there
existed
an
unbroken
chain
of
female
tricksters
a
system
of
organized
theft
and
all
because
instead
of
satisfying
men
at
once
these
women
were
skilled
in
the
subterfuges
of
delay
at
bottom
one
might
say
that
human
wisdom
consisted
in
the
protraction
of
all
things
in
saying
no
before
saying
yes
for
one
could
manage
people
only
by
trifling
with
them
ah
if
the
same
were
but
true
of
the
stomach
sighed
des
esseintes
racked
by
a
cramp
which
instantly
and
sharply
brought
back
his
mind
that
had
roved
far
off
to
fontenay
chapter
several
days
slowly
passed
thanks
to
certain
measures
which
succeeded
in
tricking
the
stomach
but
one
morning
des
esseintes
could
endure
food
no
longer
and
he
asked
himself
anxiously
whether
his
already
serious
weakness
would
not
grow
worse
and
force
him
to
take
to
bed
a
sudden
gleam
of
light
relieved
his
distress
he
remembered
that
one
of
his
friends
quite
ill
at
one
time
had
made
use
of
a
papin
digester
to
overcome
his
anaemia
and
preserve
what
little
strength
he
had
he
dispatched
his
servant
to
paris
for
this
precious
utensil
and
following
the
directions
contained
in
the
prospectus
which
the
manufacturer
had
enclosed
he
himself
instructed
the
cook
how
to
cut
the
roast
beef
into
bits
put
it
into
the
pewter
pot
with
a
slice
of
leek
and
carrot
and
screw
on
the
cover
to
let
it
boil
for
four
hours
at
the
end
of
this
time
the
meat
fibres
were
strained
he
drank
a
spoonful
of
the
thick
salty
juice
deposited
at
the
bottom
of
the
pot
then
he
felt
a
warmth
like
a
smooth
caress
descend
upon
him
this
nourishment
relieved
his
pain
and
nausea
and
even
strengthened
his
stomach
which
did
not
refuse
to
accept
these
few
drops
of
soup
thanks
to
this
digester
his
neurosis
was
arrested
and
des
esseintes
said
to
himself
well
it
is
so
much
gained
perhaps
the
temperature
will
change
the
sky
will
throw
some
ashes
upon
this
abominable
sun
which
exhausts
me
and
i
shall
hold
out
without
accident
till
the
first
fogs
and
frosts
of
winter
in
the
torpor
and
listless
ennui
in
which
he
was
sunk
the
disorder
of
his
library
whose
arrangement
had
never
been
completed
irritated
him
helpless
in
his
armchair
he
had
constantly
in
sight
the
books
set
awry
on
the
shelves
propped
against
each
other
or
lying
flat
on
their
sides
like
a
tumbled
pack
of
cards
this
disorder
offended
him
the
more
when
he
contrasted
it
with
the
perfect
order
of
his
religious
works
carefully
placed
on
parade
along
the
walls
he
tried
to
clear
up
the
confusion
but
after
ten
minutes
of
work
perspiration
covered
him
the
effort
weakened
him
he
stretched
himself
on
a
couch
and
rang
for
his
servant
following
his
directions
the
old
man
continued
the
task
bringing
each
book
in
turn
to
des
esseintes
who
examined
it
and
directed
where
it
was
to
be
placed
this
task
did
not
last
long
for
des
esseintes
library
contained
but
a
very
limited
number
of
contemporary
secular
works
they
were
drawn
through
his
brain
as
bands
of
metal
are
drawn
through
a
from
which
they
issue
thin
light
and
reduced
to
almost
imperceptible
wires
and
he
had
ended
by
possessing
only
those
books
which
could
submit
to
such
treatment
and
which
were
so
solidly
tempered
as
to
withstand
the
of
each
new
reading
in
his
desire
to
refine
he
had
restrained
and
almost
sterilized
his
enjoyment
ever
accentuating
the
irremediable
conflict
existing
between
his
ideas
and
those
of
the
world
in
which
he
had
happened
to
be
born
he
had
now
reached
such
a
pass
that
he
could
no
longer
discover
any
writings
to
content
his
secret
longings
and
his
admiration
even
weaned
itself
from
those
volumes
which
had
certainly
contributed
to
sharpen
his
mind
making
it
so
suspicious
and
subtle
in
art
his
ideas
had
sprung
from
a
simple
point
of
view
for
him
schools
did
not
exist
and
only
the
temperament
of
the
writer
mattered
only
the
working
of
his
brain
interested
him
regardless
of
the
subject
unfortunately
this
verity
of
appreciation
worthy
of
palisse
was
scarcely
applicable
for
the
simple
reason
that
even
while
desiring
to
be
free
of
prejudices
and
passion
each
person
naturally
goes
to
the
works
which
most
intimately
correspond
with
his
own
temperament
and
ends
by
relegating
all
others
to
the
rear
this
work
of
selection
had
slowly
acted
within
him
not
long
ago
he
had
adored
the
great
balzac
but
as
his
body
weakened
and
his
nerves
became
troublesome
his
tastes
modified
and
his
admirations
changed
very
soon
and
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
aware
of
his
injustice
to
the
amazing
author
of
the
des
esseintes
had
reached
a
point
where
he
no
longer
opened
balzac
books
their
healthy
spirit
jarred
on
him
other
aspirations
now
stirred
in
him
somehow
becoming
undefinable
yet
when
he
probed
himself
he
understood
that
to
attract
a
work
must
have
that
character
of
strangeness
demanded
by
edgar
allen
poe
but
he
ventured
even
further
on
this
path
and
called
for
byzantine
flora
of
brain
and
complicated
deliquescences
of
language
he
desired
a
troubled
indecision
on
which
he
might
brood
until
he
could
shape
it
at
will
to
a
more
vague
or
determinate
form
according
to
the
momentary
state
of
his
soul
in
short
he
desired
a
work
of
art
both
for
what
it
was
in
itself
and
for
what
it
permitted
him
to
endow
it
he
wished
to
pass
by
means
of
it
into
a
sphere
of
sublimated
sensation
which
would
arouse
in
him
new
commotions
whose
cause
he
might
long
and
vainly
seek
to
analyze
in
short
since
leaving
paris
des
esseintes
was
removing
himself
further
and
further
from
reality
especially
from
the
contemporary
world
which
he
held
in
an
ever
growing
detestation
this
hatred
had
inevitably
reacted
on
his
literary
and
artistic
tastes
and
he
would
have
as
little
as
possible
to
do
with
paintings
and
books
whose
limited
subjects
dealt
with
modern
life
thus
losing
the
faculty
of
admiring
beauty
indiscriminately
under
whatever
form
it
was
presented
he
preferred
flaubert
de
saint
to
his
goncourt
to
his
zola
de
to
his
this
point
of
view
seemed
logical
to
him
these
works
less
immediate
but
just
as
vibrant
and
human
enabled
him
to
penetrate
farther
into
the
depths
of
the
temperaments
of
these
masters
who
revealed
in
them
the
most
mysterious
transports
of
their
being
with
a
more
sincere
abandon
and
they
lifted
him
far
above
this
trivial
life
which
wearied
him
so
in
them
he
entered
into
a
perfect
communion
of
ideas
with
their
authors
who
had
written
them
when
their
state
of
soul
was
analogous
to
his
own
in
fact
when
the
period
in
which
a
man
of
talent
is
obliged
to
live
is
dull
and
stupid
the
artist
though
unconsciously
is
haunted
by
a
nostalgia
of
some
past
century
finding
himself
unable
to
harmonize
save
at
rare
intervals
with
the
environment
in
which
he
lives
and
not
discovering
sufficient
distraction
in
the
pleasures
of
observation
and
analysis
in
the
examination
of
the
environment
and
its
people
he
feels
in
himself
the
dawning
of
strange
ideas
confused
desires
for
other
lands
awake
and
are
clarified
by
reflection
and
study
instincts
sensations
and
thoughts
bequeathed
by
heredity
awake
grow
fixed
assert
themselves
with
an
imperious
assurance
he
recalls
memories
of
beings
and
things
he
has
never
really
known
and
a
time
comes
when
he
escapes
from
the
penitentiary
of
his
age
and
roves
in
full
liberty
into
another
epoch
with
which
through
a
last
illusion
he
seems
more
in
harmony
with
some
it
is
a
return
to
vanished
ages
to
extinct
civilizations
to
dead
epochs
with
others
it
is
an
urge
towards
a
fantastic
future
to
a
more
or
less
intense
vision
of
a
period
about
to
dawn
whose
image
by
an
effect
of
atavism
of
which
he
is
unaware
is
a
reproduction
of
some
past
age
in
flaubert
this
nostalgia
is
expressed
in
solemn
and
majestic
pictures
of
magnificent
splendors
in
whose
gorgeous
barbaric
frames
move
palpitating
and
delicate
creatures
mysterious
and
haughty
women
gifted
in
the
perfection
of
their
beauty
with
souls
capable
of
suffering
and
in
whose
depths
he
discerned
frightful
derangements
mad
aspirations
grieved
as
they
were
by
the
haunting
premonition
of
the
dissillusionments
their
follies
held
in
store
the
temperament
of
this
great
artist
is
fully
revealed
in
the
incomparable
pages
of
the
de
saint
and
where
far
from
our
sorry
life
he
evokes
the
splendors
of
old
asia
the
age
of
fervent
prayer
and
mystic
depression
of
languorous
passions
and
excesses
induced
by
the
unbearable
ennui
resulting
from
opulence
and
prayer
in
de
goncourt
it
was
the
nostalgia
of
the
preceding
century
a
return
to
the
elegances
of
a
society
forever
lost
the
stupendous
setting
of
seas
beating
against
jetties
of
deserts
stretching
under
torrid
skies
to
distant
horizons
did
not
exist
in
his
nostalgic
work
which
confined
itself
to
a
boudoir
near
an
aulic
park
scented
with
the
voluptuous
fragrance
of
a
woman
with
a
tired
smile
a
perverse
little
pout
and
unresigned
pensive
eyes
the
soul
with
which
he
animated
his
characters
was
not
that
breathed
by
flaubert
into
his
creatures
no
longer
the
soul
early
thrown
in
revolt
by
the
inexorable
certainty
that
no
new
happiness
is
possible
it
was
a
soul
that
had
too
late
revolted
after
the
experience
against
all
the
useless
attempts
to
invent
new
spiritual
liaisons
and
to
heighten
the
enjoyment
of
lovers
which
from
immemorial
times
has
always
ended
in
satiety
although
she
lived
in
and
partook
of
the
life
of
our
time
faustin
by
her
ancestral
influences
was
a
creature
of
the
past
century
whose
cerebral
lassitude
and
sensual
excesses
she
possessed
this
book
of
edmond
de
goncourt
was
one
of
the
volumes
which
des
esseintes
loved
best
and
the
suggestion
of
revery
which
he
demanded
lived
in
this
work
where
under
each
written
line
another
line
was
etched
visible
to
the
spirit
alone
indicated
by
a
hint
which
revealed
passion
by
a
reticence
permitting
one
to
divine
subtle
states
of
soul
which
no
idiom
could
express
and
it
was
no
longer
flaubert
language
in
its
inimitable
magnificence
but
a
morbid
perspicacious
style
nervous
and
twisted
keen
to
note
the
impalpable
impression
that
strikes
the
senses
a
style
expert
in
modulating
the
complicated
nuances
of
an
epoch
which
in
itself
was
singularly
complex
in
short
it
was
the
epithet
indispensable
to
decrepit
civilizations
no
matter
how
old
they
be
which
must
have
words
with
new
meanings
and
forms
innovations
in
phrases
and
words
for
their
complex
needs
at
rome
the
dying
paganism
had
modified
its
prosody
and
transmuted
its
language
with
ausonius
with
claudian
and
rutilius
whose
attentive
scrupulous
sonorous
and
powerful
style
presented
in
its
descriptive
parts
especially
reflections
hints
and
nuances
bearing
an
affinity
with
the
style
of
de
goncourt
at
paris
a
fact
unique
in
literary
history
had
been
consummated
that
moribund
society
of
the
eighteenth
century
which
possessed
painters
musicians
and
architects
imbued
with
its
tastes
and
doctrines
had
not
been
able
to
produce
a
writer
who
could
truly
depict
its
dying
elegances
the
quintessence
of
its
joys
so
cruelly
expiated
it
had
been
necessary
to
await
the
arrival
of
de
goncourt
whose
temperament
was
formed
of
memories
and
regrets
made
more
poignant
by
the
sad
spectacle
of
the
intellectual
poverty
and
the
pitiful
aspirations
of
his
own
time
to
resuscitate
not
only
in
his
historical
works
but
even
more
in
the
very
soul
of
that
period
incarnating
its
nervous
refinements
in
this
actress
who
tortured
her
mind
and
her
senses
so
as
to
savor
to
exhaustion
the
grievous
revulsives
of
love
and
of
art
with
zola
the
nostalgia
of
the
was
different
in
him
was
no
longing
for
vanished
ages
no
aspiring
toward
worlds
lost
in
the
night
of
time
his
strong
and
solid
temperament
dazzled
with
the
luxuriance
of
life
its
sanguine
forces
and
moral
health
diverted
him
from
the
artificial
graces
and
painted
chloroses
of
the
past
century
as
well
as
from
the
hierarchic
solemnity
the
brutal
ferocity
and
misty
effeminate
dreams
of
the
old
orient
when
he
too
had
become
obsessed
by
this
nostalgia
by
this
need
which
is
nothing
less
than
poetry
itself
of
shunning
the
contemporary
world
he
was
studying
he
had
rushed
into
an
ideal
and
fruitful
country
had
dreamed
of
fantastic
passions
of
skies
of
long
raptures
of
earth
and
of
fecund
rains
of
pollen
falling
into
panting
organs
of
flowers
he
had
ended
in
a
gigantic
pantheism
had
created
unwittingly
perhaps
with
this
edenesque
environment
in
which
he
placed
his
adam
and
eve
a
marvelous
hindoo
poem
singing
in
a
style
whose
broad
crude
strokes
had
something
of
the
bizarre
brilliance
of
an
indian
painting
the
song
of
the
flesh
of
animated
living
matter
revealing
to
the
human
creature
by
its
passion
for
reproduction
the
forbidden
fruits
of
love
its
suffocations
its
instinctive
caresses
and
natural
attitudes
with
baudelaire
these
three
masters
had
most
affected
des
esseintes
in
modern
french
secular
literature
but
he
had
read
them
so
often
had
saturated
himself
in
them
so
completely
that
in
order
to
absorb
them
he
had
been
compelled
to
lay
them
aside
and
let
them
remain
unread
on
his
shelves
even
now
when
the
servant
was
arranging
them
for
him
he
did
not
care
to
open
them
and
contented
himself
merely
with
indicating
the
place
they
were
to
occupy
and
seeing
that
they
were
properly
classified
and
put
away
the
servant
brought
him
a
new
series
of
books
these
oppressed
him
more
they
were
books
toward
which
his
taste
had
gradually
veered
books
which
diverted
him
by
their
very
faults
from
the
perfection
of
more
vigorous
writers
here
too
des
esseintes
had
reached
the
point
where
he
sought
among
these
troubled
pages
only
phrases
which
discharged
a
sort
of
electricity
that
made
him
tremble
they
transmitted
their
fluid
through
a
medium
which
at
first
sight
seemed
refractory
their
imperfections
pleased
him
provided
they
were
neither
parasitic
nor
servile
and
perhaps
there
was
a
grain
of
truth
in
his
theory
that
the
inferior
and
decadent
writer
who
is
more
subjective
though
unfinished
distills
a
more
irritating
aperient
and
acid
balm
than
the
artist
of
the
same
period
who
is
truly
great
in
his
opinion
it
was
in
their
turbulent
sketches
that
one
perceived
the
exaltations
of
the
most
excitable
sensibilities
the
caprices
of
the
most
morbid
psychological
states
the
most
extravagant
depravities
of
language
charged
in
spite
of
its
rebelliousness
with
the
difficult
task
of
containing
the
effervescent
salts
of
sensations
and
ideas
thus
after
the
masters
he
betook
himself
to
a
few
writers
who
attracted
him
all
the
more
because
of
the
disdain
in
which
they
were
held
by
the
public
incapable
of
understanding
them
one
of
them
was
paul
verlaine
who
had
begun
with
a
volume
of
verse
the
a
rather
ineffectual
book
where
imitations
of
leconte
de
lisle
jostled
with
exercises
in
romantic
rhetoric
but
through
which
already
filtered
the
real
personality
of
the
poet
in
such
poems
as
the
sonnet
in
searching
for
his
antecedents
des
esseintes
discovered
under
the
hesitant
strokes
of
the
sketches
a
talent
already
deeply
affected
by
baudelaire
whose
influence
had
been
accentuated
later
on
acquiesced
in
by
the
peerless
master
but
the
imitation
was
never
flagrant
and
in
some
of
his
books
sans
and
his
last
volume
were
poems
where
he
himself
was
revealed
as
an
original
and
outstanding
figure
with
rhymes
obtained
from
verb
tenses
sometimes
even
from
long
adverbs
preceded
by
a
monosyllable
from
which
they
fell
as
from
a
rock
into
a
heavy
cascade
of
water
his
verses
divided
by
improbable
caesuras
often
became
strangely
obscure
with
their
audacious
ellipses
and
strange
inaccuracies
which
none
the
less
did
not
lack
grace
with
his
unrivalled
ability
to
handle
metre
he
had
sought
to
rejuvenate
the
fixed
poetic
forms
he
turned
the
tail
of
the
sonnet
into
the
air
like
those
japanese
fish
of
polychrome
clay
which
rest
on
stands
their
heads
straight
down
their
tails
on
top
sometimes
he
corrupted
it
by
using
only
masculine
rhymes
to
which
he
seemed
partial
he
had
often
employed
a
bizarre
form
a
stanza
of
three
lines
whose
middle
verse
was
unrhymed
and
a
tiercet
with
but
one
rhyme
followed
by
a
single
line
an
echoing
refrain
like
dansons
la
gigue
in
he
had
employed
other
rhymes
whose
dim
echoes
are
repeated
in
remote
stanzas
like
faint
reverberations
of
a
bell
but
his
personality
expressed
itself
most
of
all
in
vague
and
delicious
confidences
breathed
in
hushed
accents
in
the
twilight
he
alone
had
been
able
to
reveal
the
troubled
ultima
thules
of
the
soul
low
whisperings
of
thoughts
avowals
so
haltingly
and
murmuringly
confessed
that
the
ear
which
hears
them
remains
hesitant
passing
on
to
the
soul
languors
quickened
by
the
mystery
of
this
suggestion
which
is
divined
rather
than
felt
everything
characteristic
of
verlaine
was
expressed
in
these
adorable
verses
of
the
le
soir
tombait
un
soir
equivoque
les
belles
se
pendant
reveuses
a
nos
bras
dirent
alors
des
mots
si
specieux
tout
bas
que
notre
ame
depuis
ce
temps
tremble
et
it
was
no
longer
the
immense
horizon
opened
by
the
unforgettable
portals
of
baudelaire
it
was
a
crevice
in
the
moonlight
opening
on
a
field
which
was
more
intimate
and
more
restrained
peculiar
to
verlaine
who
had
formulated
his
poetic
system
in
those
lines
of
which
des
esseintes
was
so
fond
car
nous
voulons
la
nuance
encore
pas
la
couleur
rien
que
la
nuance
et
tout
le
reste

litterature
des
esseintes
had
followed
him
with
delight
in
his
most
diversified
works
after
his
sans
which
had
appeared
in
a
journal
verlaine
had
preserved
a
long
silence
reappearing
later
in
those
charming
verses
hauntingly
suggestive
of
the
gentle
and
cold
accents
of
villon
singing
of
the
virgin
removed
from
our
days
of
carnal
thought
and
weary
flesh
des
esseintes
often
whose
poems
provoked
him
to
secret
reveries
a
fanciful
love
for
a
byzantine
madonna
who
at
a
certain
moment
changed
into
a
distracted
modern
cydalise
so
mysterious
and
troubling
that
one
could
not
know
whether
she
aspired
toward
depravities
so
monstrous
that
they
became
irresistible
or
whether
she
moved
in
an
immaculate
dream
where
the
adoration
of
the
soul
floated
around
her
ever
unavowed
and
ever
pure
there
were
other
poets
too
who
induced
him
to
confide
himself
to
them
tristan
corbiere
who
in
in
the
midst
of
the
general
apathy
had
issued
a
most
eccentric
volume
entitled
amours
des
esseintes
who
in
his
hatred
of
the
banal
and
commonplace
would
gladly
have
accepted
the
most
affected
folly
and
the
most
singular
extravagance
spent
many
enjoyable
hours
with
this
work
where
drollery
mingled
with
a
disordered
energy
and
where
disconcerting
lines
blazed
out
of
poems
so
absolutely
obscure
as
the
litanies
of
that
they
qualified
their
author
for
the
name
of
obscene
confesseur
des
devotes
the
style
was
hardly
french
the
author
wrote
in
the
negro
dialect
was
telegraphic
in
form
suppressed
verbs
affected
a
teasing
phraseology
revelled
in
the
impossible
puns
of
a
travelling
salesman
then
out
of
this
jumble
laughable
conceits
and
sly
affectations
emerged
and
suddenly
a
cry
of
keen
anguish
rang
out
like
the
snapping
string
of
a
violoncello
and
with
all
this
in
his
hard
rugged
style
bristling
with
obsolescent
words
and
unexpected
neologisms
flashed
perfect
originalities
treasures
of
expression
and
superbly
nomadic
lines
amputated
of
rhyme
finally
over
and
above
his
where
des
esseintes
had
discovered
this
profound
definition
of
woman
eternel
feminin
de
jocrisse
tristan
corbiere
had
celebrated
in
a
powerfully
concise
style
the
sea
of
brittany
mermaids
and
the
pardon
of
saint
anne
and
he
had
even
risen
to
an
eloquence
of
hate
in
the
insults
he
hurled
apropos
of
the
conlie
camp
at
the
individuals
whom
he
designated
under
the
name
of
foreigners
of
the
fourth
of
september
the
raciness
of
which
he
was
so
fond
which
corbiere
offered
him
in
his
sharp
epithets
his
beauties
which
ever
remained
a
trifle
suspect
des
esseintes
found
again
in
another
poet
theodore
hannon
a
disciple
of
baudelaire
and
gautier
moved
by
a
very
unusual
sense
of
the
exquisite
and
the
artificial
unlike
verlaine
whose
work
was
directly
influenced
by
baudelaire
especially
on
the
psychological
side
in
his
insidious
nuances
of
thought
and
skilful
quintessence
of
sentiment
theodore
hannon
especially
descended
from
the
master
on
the
plastic
side
by
the
external
vision
of
persons
and
things
his
charming
corruption
fatally
corresponded
to
the
tendencies
of
des
esseintes
who
on
misty
or
rainy
days
enclosed
himself
in
the
retreat
fancied
by
the
poet
and
intoxicated
his
eyes
with
the
rustlings
of
his
fabrics
with
the
incandescence
of
his
stones
with
his
exclusively
material
sumptuousness
which
ministered
to
cerebral
reactions
and
rose
like
a
cantharides
powder
in
a
cloud
of
fragrant
incense
toward
a
brussel
idol
with
painted
face
and
belly
stained
by
the
perfumes
with
the
exception
of
the
works
of
these
poets
and
of
stephane
mallarme
which
his
servant
was
told
to
place
to
one
side
so
that
he
might
classify
them
separately
des
esseintes
was
but
slightly
attracted
towards
the
poets
notwithstanding
the
majestic
form
and
the
imposing
quality
of
his
verse
which
struck
such
a
brilliant
note
that
even
the
hexameters
of
hugo
seemed
pale
in
comparison
leconte
de
lisle
could
no
longer
satisfy
him
the
antiquity
so
marvelously
restored
by
flaubert
remained
cold
and
immobile
in
his
hands
nothing
palpitated
in
his
verses
which
lacked
depth
and
which
most
often
contained
no
idea
nothing
moved
in
those
gloomy
waste
poems
whose
impassive
mythologies
ended
by
finally
leaving
him
cold
too
after
having
long
delighted
in
gautier
des
esseintes
reached
the
point
where
he
no
longer
cared
for
him
the
admiration
he
felt
for
this
man
incomparable
painting
had
gradually
dissolved
now
he
was
more
astonished
than
ravished
by
his
descriptions
objects
impressed
themselves
upon
gautier
perceptive
eyes
but
they
went
no
further
they
never
penetrated
deeper
into
his
brain
and
flesh
like
a
giant
mirror
this
writer
constantly
limited
himself
to
reflecting
surrounding
objects
with
impersonal
clearness
certainly
des
esseintes
still
loved
the
works
of
these
two
poets
as
he
loved
rare
stones
and
precious
objects
but
none
of
the
variations
of
these
perfect
instrumentalists
could
hold
him
longer
neither
being
evocative
of
revery
neither
opening
for
him
at
least
broad
roads
of
escape
to
beguile
the
tedium
of
dragging
hours
these
two
books
left
him
unsatisfied
and
it
was
the
same
with
hugo
the
oriental
and
patriarchal
side
was
too
conventional
and
barren
to
detain
him
and
his
manners
at
once
childish
and
that
of
a
grandfather
exasperated
him
he
had
to
go
to
the
des
rues
et
des
to
enjoy
the
perfect
acrobatics
of
his
metrics
but
how
gladly
after
all
would
he
not
have
exchanged
all
this
de
for
a
new
work
by
baudelaire
which
might
equal
the
others
for
he
decidedly
was
almost
the
only
one
whose
verses
under
their
splendid
form
contained
a
healing
and
nutritive
substance
in
passing
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
from
form
deprived
of
ideas
to
ideas
deprived
of
form
des
esseintes
remained
no
less
circumspect
and
cold
the
psychological
labyrinths
of
stendhal
the
analytical
detours
of
duranty
seduced
him
but
their
administrative
colorless
and
arid
language
their
static
prose
fit
at
best
for
the
wretched
industry
of
the
theatre
repelled
him
then
their
interesting
works
and
their
astute
analyses
applied
to
brains
agitated
by
passions
in
which
he
was
no
longer
interested
he
was
not
at
all
concerned
with
general
affections
or
points
of
view
with
associations

the

and

baudelaire
in

had
deciphered
the

age
of
sentiment

more
especially
investigated

emblematic
title

had
been
the
first
in
literature
to
pry
into
the
irresistible
unconscious
impulses
of
the
will
which
mental
pathology
now
explains
more
scientifically
he
had
also
been
the
first
to
divulge
if
not
to
signal
the
impressive
influence
of
fear
which
acts
on
the
will
like
an
anaesthetic
paralyzing
sensibility
and
like
the
curare
stupefying
the
nerves
it
was
on
the
problem
of
the
lethargy
of
the
will
that
poe
had
centered
his
studies
analyzing
the
effects
of
this
moral
poison
indicating
the
symptoms
of
its
progress
the
troubles
commencing
with
anxiety
continuing
through
anguish
ending
finally
in
the
terror
which
deadens
the
will
without
intelligence
succumbing
though
sorely
disturbed
death
which
the
dramatists
had
so
much
abused
he
had
in
some
manner
changed
and
made
more
poignant
by
introducing
an
algebraic
and
superhuman
element
but
in
truth
it
was
less
the
real
agony
of
the
dying
person
which
he
described
and
more
the
moral
agony
of
the
survivor
haunted
at
the
death
bed
by
monstrous
hallucinations
engendered
by
grief
and
fatigue
with
a
frightful
fascination

dwelt
on
acts
of
terror
on
the
snapping
of

coldly
reasoning
about
them

by

often
been
compared

their

strain
and

examination

differed
radically
in

affective
conceptions
which
held
such
a
large
place
in
their
works

with
his
iniquitous
and
debased
loves
cruel
loves
which
made
one
think
of
the
reprisals
of
an
inquisition
poe
with
his
chaste
aerial
loves
in
which
the
senses
played
no
part
where
only
the
mind
functioned
without
corresponding
to
organs
which
if
they
existed
remained
forever
frozen
and
virgin
this
cerebral
clinic
where
vivisecting
in
a
stifling
atmosphere
that
spiritual
surgeon
became
as
soon
as
his
attention
flagged
a
prey
to
an
imagination
which
evoked
like
delicious
miasmas
somnambulistic
and
angelic
apparitions
was
to
des
esseintes
a
source
of
unwearying
conjecture
but
now
that
his
nervous
disorders
were
augmented
days
came
when
his
readings
broke
his
spirit
and
when
hands
trembling
body
alert
like
the
desolate
usher
he
was
haunted
by
an
unreasoning
fear
and
a
secret
terror
thus
he
was
compelled
to
moderate
his
desires
and
he
rarely
touched
these
fearful
elixirs
in
the
same
way
that
he
could
no
longer
with
impunity
visit
his
red
corridor
and
grow
ecstatic
at
the
sight
of
the
gloomy
odilon
redon
prints
and
the
jan
luyken
horrors
and
yet
when
he
felt
inclined
to
read
all
literature
seemed
to
him
dull
after
these
terrible
american
imported
philtres
then
he
betook
himself
to
villiers
de
adam
in
whose
scattered
works
he
noted
seditious
observations
and
spasmodic
vibrations
but
which
no
longer
gave
one
with
the
exception
of
his
claire
lenoir
such
troubling
horror
this
claire
lenoir
which
appeared
in
in
the
des

a
series
of
tales
comprised
under
the
title

against
a
background

obscure
speculations
borrowed
from

dislocated

stirred

and

a
claire

farcical
and
sinister
with
blue
spectacles

and
large

almost
dead
eyes
this
story
centered
about
a
simple
adultery
and
ended
with
an
inexpressible
terror
when
bonhomet
opening
claire
eyelids
as
she
lies
in
her
death
bed
and
penetrating
them
with
monstrous
plummets
distinctively
perceives
the
reflection
of
the
husband
brandishing
the
lover
decapitated
head
while
shouting
a
war
song
like
a
kanaka
based
on
this
more
or
less
just
observation
that
the
eyes
of
certain
animals
cows
for
instance
preserve
even
to
decomposition
like
photographic
plates
the
image
of
the
beings
and
things
their
eyes
behold
at
the
moment
they
expire
this
story
evidently
derived
from
poe
from
whom
he
appropriated
the
terrifying
and
elaborate
technique
this
also
applied
to
the
which
had
later
been
joined
to
the
a
collection
of
indisputable
talent
in
which
was
found
which
des
esseintes
considered
a
little
masterpiece
here
the
hallucination
was
marked
with
an
exquisite
tenderness
no
longer
was
it
the
dark
mirages
of
the
american
author
but
the
fluid
warm
almost
celestial
vision
it
was
in
an
identical
genre
the
reverse
of
the
beatrices
and
legeias
those
gloomy
and
dark
phantoms
engendered
by
the
inexorable
nightmare
of
opium
this
story
also
put
in
play
the
operations
of
the
will
but
it
no
longer
treated
of
its
defeats
and
helplessness
under
the
effects
of
fear
on
the
contrary
it
studied
the
exaltations
of
the
will
under
the
impulse
of
a
fixed
idea
it
demonstrated
its
power
which
often
succeeded
in
saturating
the
atmosphere
and
in
imposing
its
qualities
on
surrounding
objects
another

seemed
to
him
curious
in
other
respects
the
philosophic
medley
of
clair

evident
in
this
work
which
offered
an
unbelievable
jumble
of
verbal
and
troubled
observations
souvenirs
of
old
melodramas
poniards
and
rope
ladders
all
the
romanticism
which

never

the
enigmatic

insoluble

a
fuliginous
vapor
across
which
philosophic
and
literary
influences
jostled
without
being
able
to
be
regulated
in
the
brain
when
he
wrote
the
prolegomenae
of
this
work
which
could
not
have
embraced
less
than
seven
volumes
but
there
was
another
side
to
villiers
temperament
it
was
piercing
and
acute
in
an
altogether
different
sense
a
side
of
forbidding
pleasantry
and
fierce
raillery
no
longer
was
it
the
paradoxical
mystifications
of

a
scoffing

the
pleasure

be

from

was
merely
relative
since
its
execution
was
a
dismal
failure

firm

and

dismissed

turned
over
the
leaves
of
a
volume
bound
in

had
been
glazed
by

not

himself

by

in

was
now
plunged
in
gloom
revealing

a
dim
white
statue
in

times

was
forced
to
gaze
upon

lived
for
him
her
lips
articulating
those
bizarre
and
delicate
lines

loved
as
he
loved
the
works
of
this
poet
who
in
an
age
of
democracy
devoted
to
lucre
lived
his
solitary
and
literary
life
sheltered
by
his
disdain
from
the
encompassing
stupidity
delighting
far
from
society
in
the
surprises
of
the
intellect
in
cerebral
visions
refining
on
subtle
ideas
grafting
byzantine
delicacies
upon
them
perpetuating
them
in
suggestions
lightly
connected
by
an
almost
imperceptible
thread
these
twisted
and
precious
ideas
were
bound
together
with
an
adhesive
and
secret
language
full
of
phrase
contractions
ellipses
and
bold
tropes
perceiving
the
remotest
analogies
with
a
single
term
which
by
an
effect
of
similitude
at
once
gave
the
form
the
perfume
the
color
and
the
quality
he
described
the
object
or
being
to
which
otherwise
he
would
have
been
compelled
to
place
numerous
and
different
epithets
so
as
to
disengage
all
their
facets
and
nuances
had
he
simply
contented
himself
with
indicating
the
technical
name
thus
he
succeeded
in
dispensing
with
the
comparison
which
formed
in
the
reader
mind
by
analogy
as
soon
as
the
symbol
was
understood
neither
was

of
the
reader
diverted
by
the
enumeration
of
the
qualities
which
the
juxtaposition
of
adjectives
would
have
induced
concentrating
upon

word
he

the
ensemble

unique
and

a
sublimate

at
first
employed
with
restraint
in

proclaimed
it

and

leaped
up
at

poet
described
the
elations

at
the
edge

this

a
selection

fantastic
aloysius

had
transferred
the
behavior
of

in

which
were

united
such
a
magnificently
delicate

that

cradled

thoughts

by

in
its
slender
volume
the
strength
of
the
novel

analytic
developments
and
descriptive
redundancies
it
suppressed
quite
often

meditated
on
that
disquieting
problem
to
write
a
novel

in
a
few
phrases

the
essence
of
hundreds
of
pages

employed
to
establish
the
setting
to
sketch
the
characters

to
pile
up

unexchangeable

in

an
ingenious
and
definite
fashion
that

such
perspectives

gleams
of
this
unique

become
a
communion

collaboration

with
such
deep
joy
when
he
had
closed
his
anthology
des
esseintes
told
himself
that
his
books
which
had
ended
on
this
last
book
would
probably
never
have
anything
added
to
it
in
fact
the
decadence
of
a
literature
irreparably
affected
in
its
organism
enfeebled
by
old
ideas
exhausted
by
excesses
of
syntax
sensitive
only
to
the
curiosities
which
make
sick
persons
feverish
and
yet
intent
upon
expressing
everything
in
its
decline

to
repair
all
the
omissions
of
enjoyment

in

in
the
most
perfect
exquisite

the
quintessences
of
baudelaire
and
of

here
were
their
fine
and
powerful
substances
distilled
and
disengaging
new
flavors
and
intoxications
it
was
the
agony
of
the
old
language
which
after
having
become
moldy
from
age
to
age
ended
by
dissolving
by
reaching
that
deliquescence
of
the
latin
language
which
expired
in
the
mysterious
concepts
and
the
enigmatical
expressions
of
saint
boniface
and
saint
adhelme
the
decomposition
of
the
french
language
had
been
effected
suddenly
in
the
latin
language
a
long
transition
a
distance
of
four
hundred
years
existed
between
the
spotted
and
superb
epithet
of
claudian
and
rutilius
and
the
gamy
epithet
of
the
eighth
century
in
the
french
language
no
lapse
of
time
no
succession
of
ages
had
taken
place
the
stained
and
superb
style
of
the
de
goncourts
and
the
gamy
style
of
verlaine
and
mallarme
jostled
in
paris
living
in
the
same
period
epoch
and
century
and
des
esseintes
gazing
at
one
of
the
folios
opened
on
his
chapel
desk
smiled
at
the
thought
that
the
moment
would
soon
come
when
an
erudite
scholar
would
prepare
for
the
decadence
of
the
french
language
a
glossary
similar
to
that
in
which
the
savant
du
cange
has
noted
the
last
murmurings
the
last
spasms
the
last
flashes
of
the
latin
language
dying
of
old
age
in
the
cloisters
and
sounding
its
death
rattle
chapter
burning
at
first
like
a
rick
on
fire
his
enthusiasm
for
the
digester
as
quickly
died
out
torpid
at
first
his
nervous
dyspepsia
reappeared
and
then
this
hot
essence
induced
such
an
irritation
in
his
stomach
that
des
esseintes
was
quickly
compelled
to
stop
using
it
the
malady
increased
in
strength
peculiar
symptoms
attended
it
after
the
nightmares
hallucinations
of
smell
pains
in
the
eye
and
deep
coughing
which
recurred
with
regularity
after
the
pounding
of
his
heart
and
arteries
and
the
cold
perspiration
arose
illusions
of
hearing
those
alterations
which
only
reveal
themselves
in
the
last
period
of
sickness
attacked
by
a
strong
fever
des
esseintes
suddenly
heard
murmurings
of
water
then
those
sounds
united
into
one
and
resembled
a
roaring
which
increased
and
then
slowly
resolved
itself
into
a
silvery
bell
sound
he
felt
his
delirious
brain
whirling
in
musical
waves
engulfed
in
the
mystic
whirlwinds
of
his
infancy
the
songs
learned
at
the
jesuits
reappeared
bringing
with
them
pictures
of
the
school
and
the
chapel
where
they
had
resounded
driving
their
hallucinations
to
the
olfactory
and
visual
organs
veiling
them
with
clouds
of
incense
and
the
pallid
light
irradiating
through
the
windows
under
the
lofty
arches
at
the
fathers
the
religious
ceremonies
had
been
practiced
with
great
pomp
an
excellent
organist
and
remarkable
singing
director
made
an
artistic
delight
of
these
spiritual
exercises
that
were
conducive
to
worship
the
organist
was
in
love
with
the
old
masters
and
on
holidays
celebrated
masses
by
palestrina
and
orlando

by
marcello

he
preferred
to
render
the
sweet
and
facile
compilations
of
father
lambillotte
so
much
favored
by
priests
the
laudi
spirituali
of
the
sixteenth
century
whose
sacerdotal
beauty
had
often
bewitched
des
esseintes
but
he
particularly
extracted
ineffable
pleasures
while
listening
to
the
which
the
organist
had
preserved
regardless
of
new
ideas
that
form
which
was
now
considered
a
decrepit
and
gothic
form
of
christian
liturgy
an
archaeological
curiosity
a
relic
of
ancient
time
had
been
the
voice
of
the
early
church
the
soul
of
the
middle
age
it
was
the
eternal
prayer
that
had
been
sung
and
modulated
in
harmony
with
the
soul
transports
the
enduring
hymn
uplifted
for
centuries
to
the
almighty
that
traditional
melody
was
the
only
one
which
with
its
strong
unison
its
solemn
and
massive
harmonies
like
freestone
was
not
out
of
place
with
the
old
basilicas
making
eloquent
the
romanesque
vaults
whose
emanation
and
very
spirit
they
seemed
to
be
how
often
had
des
esseintes
not
thrilled
under
its
spell
when
the
christus
factus
est
of
the
gregorian
chant
rose
from
the
nave
whose
pillars
seemed
to
tremble
among
the
rolling
clouds
from
censers
or
when
the
de
profundis
was
sung
sad
and
mournful
as
a
suppressed
sob
poignant
as
a
despairing
invocation
of
humanity
bewailing
its
mortal
destiny
and
imploring
the
tender
forgiveness
of
its
savior
all
religious
music
seemed
profane
to
him
compared
with
that
magnificent
chant
created
by
the
genius
of
the
church
anonymous
as
the
organ
whose
inventor
is
unknown
at
bottom
in
the
works
of
jomelli
and
porpora
carissimi
and
durante
in
the
most
wonderful
compositions
of

and

there
was
never
a
hint
of
a
renunciation
of
public
success
or
the
sacrifice
of
an
effect
of
art
or
the
abdication
of
human
pride
hearkening
to
its
own
prayer
at

and

crystallized
in

imposing
masses
celebrated
at
tending
to
approach
the
severe
nudity
and
austere
majesty
of
the
old
since
then
absolutely
revolted
by
these
pretexts
at
devised
by
the
pergolesis
and
the
rossinis
by
this
intrusion
of
profane
art
in
liturgic
art
des
esseintes
had
shunned
those
ambiguous
works
tolerated
by
the
indulgent
church
in
addition
this
weakness
brought
about
by
the
desire
for
large
congregations
had
quickly
resulted
in
the
adoption
of
songs
borrowed
from
italian
operas
of
low
cavatinas
and
indecent
quadrilles
played
in
churches
converted
to
boudoirs
and
surrendered
to
stage
actors
whose
voices
resounded
aloft
their
impurity
tainting
the
tones
of
the
holy
organ
for
years
he
had
obstinately
refused
to
take
part
in
these
pious
entertainments
contenting
himself
with
his
memories
of
childhood
he
even
regretted
having
heard
the
of
the
great
masters
for
he
remembered
that
admirable
that
hymn
so
simple
and
solemn
composed
by
some
unknown
saint
a
saint
ambrose
or
hilary
who
lacking
the
complicated
resources
of
an
orchestra
and
the
musical
mechanics
of
modern
science
revealed
an
ardent
faith
a
delirious
jubilation
uttered
from
the
soul
of
humanity
in
the
piercing
and
almost
celestial
accents
of
conviction
des
esseintes
ideas
on
music
were
in
flagrant
contradiction
with
the
theories
he
professed
regarding
the
other
arts
in
religious
music
he
approved
only
of
the
monastic
music
of
the
middle
ages
that
emaciated
music
which
instinctively
reacted
on
his
nerves
like
certain
pages
of
the
old
christian
latin
then
he
freely
confessed
it
he
was
incapable
of
understanding
the
tricks
that
the
contemporary
masters
had
introduced
into
catholic
art
and
he
had
not
studied
music
with
that
passion
which
had
led
him
towards
painting
and
letters
he
played
indifferently
on
the
piano
and
after
many
painful
attempts
had
succeeded
in
reading
a
score
but
he
was
ignorant
of
harmony
of
the
technique
needed
really
to
understand
a
nuance
to
appreciate
a
finesse
to
savor
a
refinement
with
full
comprehension
in
other
respects
when
not
read
in
solitude
profane
music
is
a
promiscuous
art
to
enjoy
music
one
must
become
part
of
that
public
which
fills
the
theatres
where
in
a
vile
atmosphere
one
perceives
a
man
butchering
episodes
from
wagner
to
the
huge
delight
of
the
ignorant
mob
he
had
always
lacked
the
courage
to
plunge
in
this
so
as
to
listen
to
berlioz
compositions
several
fragments
of
which
had
bewitched
him
by
their
passionate
exaltations
and
their
vigorous
fugues
and
he
was
certain
that
there
was
not
one
single
scene
not
even
a
phrase
of
one
of
the
operas
of
the
amazing
wagner
which
could
with
impunity
be
detached
from
its
whole
the
fragments
cut
and
served
on
the
plate
of
a
concert
lost
all
significance
and
remained
senseless
since
like
the
chapters
of
a
book
completing
each
other
and
moving
to
an
inevitable
conclusion
wagner
melodies
were
necessary
to
sketch
the
characters
to
incarnate
their
thoughts
and
to
express
their
apparent
or
secret
motives
he
knew
that
their
ingenious
and
persistent
returns
were
understood
only
by
the
auditors
who
followed
the
subject
from
the
beginning
and
gradually
beheld
the
characters
in
relief
in
a
setting
from
which
they
could
not
be
removed
without
dying
like
branches
torn
from
a
tree
that
was
why
he
felt
that
among
the
vulgar
herd
of
melomaniacs
enthusing
each
sunday
on
benches
scarcely
any
knew
the
score
that
was
being
massacred
when
the
ushers
consented
to
be
silent
and
permit
the
orchestra
to
be
heard
granted
also
that
intelligent
patriotism
forbade
a
french
theatre
to
give
a
wagnerian
opera
the
only
thing
left
to
the
curious
who
know
nothing
of
musical
arcana
and
either
can
not
or
will
not
betake
themselves
to
bayreuth
is
to
remain
at
home
and
that
was
precisely
the
course
of
conduct
he
had
pursued
the
more
public
and
facile
music
and
the
independent
pieces
of
the
old
operas
hardly
interested
him
the
wretched
trills
of
auber
and
boieldieu
of
adam
and
flotow
and
the
rhetorical
commonplaces
of
ambroise
thomas
and
the
bazins
disgusted
him
as
did
the
superannuated
affectations
and
vulgar
graces
of
italians
that
was
why
he
had
resolutely
broken
with
musical
art
and
during
the
years
of
his
abstention
he
pleasurably
recalled
only
certain
programs
of
chamber
music
when
he
had
heard
beethoven
and
especially
schumann
and
schubert
which
had
affected
his
nerves
in
the
same
manner
as
had
the
more
intimate
and
troubling
poems
of
edgar
allen
poe
some
of
schubert
parts
for
violoncello
had
positively
left
him
panting
in
the
grip
of
hysteria
but
it
was
particularly
lieders
that
had
immeasurably
excited
him
causing
him
to
experience
similar
sensations
as
after
a
waste
of
nervous
fluid
or
a
mystic
dissipation
of
the
soul
this
music
penetrated
and
drove
back
an
infinity
of
forgotten
sufferings
and
spleen
in
his
heart
he
was
astonished
at
being
able
to
contain
so
many
dim
miseries
and
vague
griefs
this
desolate
music
crying
from
the
inmost
depths
terrified
while
charming
him
never
could
he
repeat
the
young
girl
lament
without
a
welling
of
tears
in
his
eyes
for
in
this
plaint
resided
something
beyond
a
mere
state
something
in
it
clutched
him
something
like
a
romance
ending
in
a
gloomy
landscape
and
always
when
these
exquisite
sad
plaints
returned
to
his
lips
there
was
evoked
for
him
a
suburban
flinty
and
gloomy
site
where
a
succession
of
silent
bent
persons
harassed
by
life
filed
past
into
the
twilight
while
steeped
in
bitterness
and
overflowing
with
disgust
he
felt
himself
solitary
in
this
dejected
landscape
struck
by
an
inexpressibly
melancholy
and
stubborn
distress
whose
mysterious
intensity
excluded
all
consolation
pity
and
repose
like
a
this
despairing
chant
haunted
him
now
that
he
was
in
bed
prostrated
by
fever
and
agitated
by
an
anxiety
so
much
the
more
inappeasable
for
the
fact
that
he
could
not
discover
its
cause
he
ended
by
abandoning
himself
to
the
torrent
of
anguishes
suddenly
dammed
by
the
chant
of
psalms
slowly
rising
in
his
tortured
head
one
morning
nevertheless
he
felt
more
tranquil
and
requested
the
servant
to
bring
a
it
fell
from
his
hands
he
hardly
recognized
himself
his
face
was
a
clay
color
the
lips
bloated
and
dry
the
tongue
parched
the
skin
rough
his
hair
and
beard
untended
since
his
illness
by
the
domestic
added
to
the
horror
of
the
sunken
face
and
staring
eyes
burning
with
feverish
intensity
in
this
skeleton
head
that
bristled
with
hair
more
than
his
weakness
more
than
his
vomitings
which
began
with
each
attempt
at
taking
nourishment
more
than
his
emaciation
did
his
changed
visage
terrify
him
he
felt
lost
then
in
the
dejection
which
overcame
him
a
sudden
energy
forced
him
in
a
sitting
posture
he
had
strength
to
write
a
letter
to
his
paris
physician
and
to
order
the
servant
to
depart
instantly
seek
and
bring
him
back
that
very
day
he
passed
suddenly
from
complete
depression
into
boundless
hope
this
physician
was
a
celebrated
specialist
a
doctor
renowned
for
his
cures
of
nervous
maladies
he
must
have
cured
many
more
dangerous
cases
than
mine
des
esseintes
reflected
i
shall
certainly
be
on
my
feet
in
a
few
days
disenchantment
succeeded
his
confidence
learned
and
intuitive
though
they
be
physicians
know
absolutely
nothing
of
neurotic
diseases
being
ignorant
of
their
origins
like
the
others
this
one
would
prescribe
the
eternal
oxyde
of
zinc
and
quinine
bromide
of
potassium
and
valerian
he
had
recourse
to
another
thought
if
these
remedies
have
availed
me
little
in
the
past
could
it
not
be
due
to
the
fact
that
i
have
not
taken
the
right
quantities
in
spite
of
everything
this
expectation
of
being
cured
cheered
him
but
then
a
new
fear
entered
his
servant
might
have
failed
to
find
the
physician
again
he
grew
faint
passing
instantly
from
the
most
unreasoning
hopes
to
the
most
baseless
fears
exaggerating
the
chances
of
a
sudden
recovery
and
his
apprehensions
of
danger
the
hours
passed
and
the
moment
came
when
in
utter
despair
and
convinced
that
the
physician
would
not
arrive
he
angrily
told
himself
that
he
certainly
would
have
been
saved
had
he
acted
sooner
then
his
rage
against
the
servant
and
the
physician
whom
he
accused
of
permitting
him
to
die
vanished
and
he
ended
by
reproaching
himself
for
having
waited
so
long
before
seeking
aid
persuading
himself
that
he
would
now
be
wholly
cured
had
he
that
very
last
evening
used
the
medicine
little
by
little
these
alternations
of
hope
and
alarms
jostling
in
his
poor
head
abated
the
struggles
ended
by
crushing
him
and
he
relapsed
into
exhausted
sleep
interrupted
by
incoherent
dreams
a
sort
of
syncope
pierced
by
awakenings
in
which
he
was
barely
conscious
of
anything
he
had
reached
such
a
state
where
he
lost
all
idea
of
desires
and
fears
and
he
was
stupefied
experiencing
neither
astonishment
or
joy
when
the
physician
suddenly
arrived
the
doctor
had
doubtless
been
apprised
by
the
servant
of
des
esseintes
mode
of
living
and
of
the
various
symptoms
observed
since
the
day
when
the
master
of
the
house
had
been
found
near
the
window
overwhelmed
by
the
violence
of
perfumes
he
put
very
few
questions
to
the
patient
whom
he
had
known
for
many
years
he
felt
his
pulse
and
attentively
studied
the
urine
where
certain
white
spots
revealed
one
of
the
determining
causes
of
nervousness
he
wrote
a
prescription
and
left
without
saying
more
than
that
he
would
soon
return
this
visit
comforted
des
esseintes
who
none
the
less
was
frightened
by
the
taciturnity
observed
he
adjured
his
servant
not
to
conceal
the
truth
from
him
any
longer
but
the
servant
declared
that
the
doctor
had
exhibited
no
uneasiness
and
despite
his
suspicions
des
esseintes
could
seize
upon
no
sign
that
might
betray
a
shadow
of
a
lie
on
the
tranquil
countenance
of
the
old
man
then
his
thoughts
began
to
obsess
him
less
his
suffering
disappeared
and
to
the
exhaustion
he
had
felt
throughout
his
members
was
grafted
a
certain
indescribable
languor
he
was
astonished
and
satisfied
not
to
be
weighted
with
drugs
and
vials
and
a
faint
smile
played
on
his
lips
when
the
servant
brought
a
nourishing
injection
of
peptone
and
told
him
he
was
to
take
it
three
times
every
hours
the
operation
succeeded
and
des
esseintes
could
not
forbear
to
congratulate
himself
on
this
event
which
in
a
manner
crowned
the
existence
he
had
created
his
penchant
towards
the
artificial
had
now
though
involuntarily
reached
the
supreme
goal
farther
one
could
not
go
the
nourishment
thus
absorbed
was
the
ultimate
deviation
one
could
possibly
commit
how
delicious
it
would
be
he
reflected
to
continue
this
simple
regime
in
complete
health
what
economy
of
time
what
a
pronounced
deliverance
from
the
aversion
which
food
gives
those
who
lack
appetite
what
a
complete
riddance
from
the
disgust
induced
by
food
forcibly
eaten
what
an
energetic
protestation
against
the
vile
sin
of
gluttony
what
a
positive
insult
hurled
at
old
nature
whose
monotonous
demands
would
thus
be
avoided
and
he
continued
talking
to
himself
one
could
easily
stimulate
desire
for
food
by
swallowing
a
strong
aperitif
after
the
question
what
time
is
it
getting
to
be
i
am
famished
one
would
move
to
the
table
and
place
the
instrument
on
the
cloth
and
then
in
the
time
it
takes
to
say
grace
one
could
have
suppressed
the
tiresome
and
vulgar
demands
of
the
body
several
days
afterwards
the
servant
presented
an
injection
whose
color
and
odor
differed
from
the
other
but
it
is
not
the
same
at
all
des
esseintes
cried
gazing
with
deep
feeling
at
the
liquid
poured
into
the
apparatus
as
if
in
a
restaurant
he
asked
for
the
card
and
unfolding
the
prescription
read
cod
liver
oil
grammes
beef
tea
grammes
burgundy
wine
grammes
yolk
of
one
egg
he
remained
meditative
he
who
by
reason
of
the
weakened
state
of
his
stomach
had
never
seriously
preoccupied
himself
with
the
art
of
the
cuisine
was
surprised
to
find
himself
thinking
of
combinations
to
please
an
artificial
epicure
then
a
strange
idea
crossed
his
brain
perhaps
the
physician
had
imagined
that
the
strange
palate
of
his
patient
was
fatigued
by
the
taste
of
the
peptone
perhaps
he
had
wished
like
a
clever
chef
to
vary
the
taste
of
foods
and
to
prevent
the
monotony
of
dishes
that
might
lead
to
want
of
appetite
once
in
the
wake
of
these
reflections
des
esseintes
sketched
new
recipes
preparing
vegetable
dinners
for
fridays
using
the
dose
of
cod
liver
oil
and
wine
dismissing
the
beef
tea
as
a
meat
food
specially
prohibited
by
the
church
but
he
had
no
occasion
longer
to
ruminate
on
these
nourishing
drinks
for
the
physician
succeeded
gradually
in
curing
the
vomiting
attacks
and
he
was
soon
swallowing
in
the
normal
manner
a
syrup
of
punch
containing
a
pulverized
meat
whose
faint
aroma
of
cacao
pleased
his
palate
weeks
passed
before
his
stomach
decided
to
function
the
nausea
returned
at
certain
moments
but
these
attacks
were
disposed
of
by
ginger
ale
and
rivieres
antiemetic
drink
finally
the
organs
were
restored
meats
were
digested
with
the
aid
of
pepsines
recovering
strength
he
was
able
to
stand
up
and
attempt
to
walk
leaning
on
a
cane
and
supporting
himself
on
the
furniture
instead
of
being
thankful
over
his
success
he
forgot
his
past
pains
grew
irritated
at
the
length
of
time
needed
for
convalescence
and
reproached
the
doctor
for
not
effecting
a
more
rapid
cure
at
last
the
day
came
when
he
could
remain
standing
for
whole
afternoons
then
his
study
irritated
him
certain
blemishes
it
possessed
and
which
habit
had
accustomed
him
to
overlook
now
were
apparent
the
colors
chosen
to
be
seen
by
seemed
discordant
in
full
day
he
thought
of
changing
them
and
for
whole
hours
he
combined
rebellious
harmonies
of
hues
hybrid
pairings
of
cloth
and
leathers
i
am
certainly
on
the
road
to
recovery
he
reflected
taking
note
of
his
old
hobbies
one
morning
while
contemplating
his
orange
and
blue
walls
considering
some
ideal
tapestries
worked
with
stoles
of
the
greek
church
dreaming
of
russian
orphrey
dalmaticas
and
brocaded
copes
flowered
with
slavonic
letters
done
in
ural
stones
and
rows
of
pearls
the
physician
entered
and
noticing
the
patient
eyes
questioned
him
des
esseintes
spoke
of
his
unrealizable
longings
he
commenced
to
contrive
new
color
schemes
to
talk
of
harmonies
and
discords
of
tones
he
meant
to
produce
when
the
doctor
stunned
him
by
peremptorily
announcing
that
these
projects
would
never
be
executed
here
and
without
giving
him
time
to
catch
breath
he
informed
des
esseintes
that
he
had
done
his
utmost
in
the
digestive
functions
and
that
now
it
was
necessary
to
attack
the
neurosis
which
was
by
no
means
cured
and
which
would
necessitate
years
of
diet
and
care
he
added
that
before
attempting
a
cure
before
commencing
any
hydrotherapic
treatment
impossible
of
execution
at
fontenay
des
esseintes
must
quit
that
solitude
return
to
paris
and
live
an
ordinary
mode
of
existence
by
amusing
himself
like
others
but
the
pleasures
of
others
will
not
amuse
me
des
esseintes
indignantly
cried
without
debating
the
matter
the
doctor
merely
asserted
that
this
radical
change
was
in
his
eyes
a
question
of
life
or
death
a
question
of
health
or
insanity
possibly
complicated
in
the
near
future
by
tuberculosis
so
it
is
a
choice
between
death
and
the
hulks
des
esseintes
exasperatedly
exclaimed
the
doctor
who
was
imbued
with
all
the
prejudices
of
a
man
of
the
world
smiled
and
reached
the
door
without
saying
a
word
chapter
des
esseintes
locked
himself
up
in
his
bedroom
closing
his
ears
to
the
sounds
of
hammers
on
packing
cases
each
stroke
rent
his
heart
drove
a
sorrow
into
his
flesh
the
physician
order
was
being
fulfilled
the
fear
of
once
more
submitting
to
the
pains
he
had
endured
the
fear
of
a
frightful
agony
had
acted
more
powerfully
on
des
esseintes
than
the
hatred
of
the
detestable
existence
to
which
the
medical
order
condemned
him
yet
he
told
himself
there
were
people
who
live
without
conversing
with
anyone
absorbed
far
from
the
world
in
their
own
affairs
like
recluses
and
trappists
and
there
is
nothing
to
prove
that
these
wretches
and
sages
become
madmen
or
consumptives
he
had
unsuccessfully
cited
these
examples
to
the
doctor
the
latter
had
repeated
coldly
and
firmly
in
a
tone
that
admitted
of
no
reply
that
his
verdict
confirmed
besides
by
consultation
with
all
the
experts
on
neurosis
was
that
distraction
amusement
pleasure
alone
might
make
an
impression
on
this
malady
whose
spiritual
side
eluded
all
remedy
and
made
impatient
by
the
recriminations
of
his
patient
he
for
the
last
time
declared
that
he
would
refuse
to
continue
treating
him
if
he
did
not
consent
to
a
change
of
air
and
live
under
new
hygienic

unhesitatingly
approved
of

action

had
rented
an
apartment
in
a
new
house
had
returned
to
fontenay
and
white
with
rage
had
given
orders
to
have
his
trunks
packed
sunk
in
his
easy
chair
he
now
ruminated
upon
that
unyielding
order
which
was
wrecking
his
plans
breaking
the
strings
of
his
present
life
and
overturning
his
future
plans
his
beatitude
was
ended
he
was
compelled
to
abandon
this
sheltering
haven
and
return
at
full
speed
into
the
stupidity
which

attacked
him
the

spoke
of

and
distraction

whom
and
with
what
did
they
wish
him
to
distract

he
not

himself
from

would
approximate

did
he
know

capable
of
appreciating
the
fineness
of
a
phrase
the
subtlety
of
a

quintessence

the

the

imbecility

it
was
extinguished
in

corruption

in

of

heavy
ledgers
reposed
on
like
leprosy
the
avidity
of
the
age
was
ravaging
the
church
weighing
down
the
monks
with
inventories
and
invoices
and
yet
in
spite
of
everything
it
was
only
among
the
ecclesiastics
that
des
esseintes
could
hope
for
pleasurable
contract
in
the
society
of
and
learned
canons
he
would
have
been
compelled
to
share
their
faith
to
refrain
from
floating
between
sceptical
ideas
and
transports
of
conviction
which
rose
from
time
to
time
on
the
water
sustained
by
recollections
of
childhood
he
would
have
had
to
muster
identical
opinions
and
never
admit
he
freely
did
in
his
ardent
moments
a
catholicism
charged
with
a
soupcon
of
magic
as
under
henry
the
third
and
with
a
dash
of
sadism
as
at
the
end
of
the
last
century
this
special
clericalism
this
depraved
and
artistically
perverse
mysticism
towards
which
he
wended
could
not
even
be
discussed
with
a
priest
who
would
not
have
understood
them
or
who
would
have
banished
them
with
horror
for
the
twentieth
time
this
irresolvable
problem
troubled
him
he
would
have
desired
an
end
to
this
irresolute
state
in
which
he
floundered
now
that
he
was
pursuing
a
changed
life
he
would
have
liked
to
possess
faith
to
incrust
it
as
soon
as
seized
to
screw
it
into
his
soul
to
shield
it
finally
from
all
those
reflections
which
uprooted
and
agitated
it
but
the
more
he
desired
it
and
the
less
his
emptiness
of
spirit
was
evident
the
more
christ
visitation
receded
as
his
religious
hunger
augmented
and
he
gazed
eagerly
at
this
faith
visible
but
so
far
off
that
the
distance
terrified
him
ideas
pressed
upon
his
active
mind
driving
back
his
will
rejecting
by
common
sense
and
mathematical
proofs
the
mysteries
and
dogmas
he
sadly
told
himself
that
he
would
have
to
find
a
way
to
abstain
from
he
would
have
to
learn
how
to
close
his
eyes
and
let
himself
be
swept
along
by
the
current
forgetting
those
accursed
discoveries
which
have
destroyed
the
religious
edifice
from
top
to
bottom
since
the
last
two
centuries
he
sighed
it
is
neither
the
physiologists
nor
the
infidels
that
demolish
catholicism
but
the
priests
whose
stupid
works
could
extirpate
convictions
the
most
steadfast
a
dominican
friar
rouard
de
card
had
proved
in
a
brochure
entitled
on
the
adulteration
of
sacramental
substances
that
most
masses
were
not
valid
because
the
elements
used
for
worship
had
been
adulterated
by
the
manufacturers
for
years
the
holy
oils
had
been
adulterated
with
chicken
fat
wax
with
burned
bones
incense
with
cheap
resin
and
benzoin
but
the
thing
that
was
worse
was
that
the
substances
indispensable
to
the
holy
sacrifice
the
two
substances
without
which
no
oblation
is
possible
had
also
been
debased
the
wine
by
numerous
dilutions
and
by
illicit
introductions
of
pernambuco
wood
danewort
berries
alcohol
and
alum
the
bread
of
the
eucharist
that
must
be
kneaded
with
the
fine
flour
of
wheat
by
kidney
beans
potash
and
pipe
clay
but
they
had
gone
even
farther
they
had
dared
suppress
the
wheat
and
shameless
dealers
were
making
almost
all
the
host
with
the
fecula
of
potatoes
now
god
refused
to
descend
into
the
fecula
it
was
an
undeniable
fact
and
a
certain
one
in
the
second
volume
of
his
treatise
on
moral
theology
cardinal
gousset
had
dwelt
at
length
on
this
question
of
the
fraud
practiced
from
the
divine
point
of
view
and
according
to
the
incontestable
authority
of
this
master
one
could
not
consecrate
bread
made
of
flour
of
oats
buckwheat
or
barley
and
if
the
matter
of
using
rye
be
less
doubtful
no
argument
was
possible
in
regard
to
the
fecula
which
according
to
the
ecclesiastic
expression
was
in
no
way
fit
for
sacramental
purposes
by
means
of
the
rapid
manipulation
of
the
fecula
and
the
beautiful
appearance
presented
by
the
unleavened
breads
created
with
this
element
the
shameless
imposture
had
been
so
propagated
that
now
the
mystery
of
the
transubstantiation
hardly
existed
any
longer
and
the
priests
and
faithful
were
holding
communion
without
being
aware
of
it
with
neutral
elements
ah
far
off
was
the
time
when
radegonda
queen
of
france
had
with
her
own
hands
prepared
the
bread
destined
for
the
alters
or
the
time
when
after
the
customs
of
cluny
three
priests
or
deacons
fasting
and
garbed
in
alb
and
amice
washed
their
faces
and
hands
and
then
picked
out
the
wheat
grain
by
grain
grinding
it
under
millstone
kneading
the
paste
in
a
cold
and
pure
water
and
themselves
baking
it
under
a
clear
fire
while
chanting
psalms
all
this
matter
of
eternal
dupery
des
esseintes
reflected
is
not
conducive
to
the
steadying
of
my
already
weakened
faith
and
how
admit
that
omnipotence
which
stops
at
such
a
trifle
as
a
pinch
of
fecula
or
a
soupcon
of
alcohol
these
reflections
all
the
more
threw
a
gloom
over
the
view
of
his
future
life
and
rendered
his
horizon
more
menacing
and
dark
he
was
lost
utterly
lost
what
would
become
of
him
in
this
paris
where
he
had
neither
family
nor
friends
no
bond
united
him
to
the
quarters
now
in
its
dotage
scaling
into
the
dust
of
desuetude
buried
in
a
new
society
like
an
empty
husk
and
what
contact
could
exist
between
him
and
that
bourgeois
class
which
had
gradually
climbed
up
profiting
by
all
the
disasters
to
grow
rich
making
use
of
all
the
catastrophes
to
impose
respect
on
its
crimes
and
thefts
after
the
aristocracy
of
birth
had
come
the
aristocracy
of
money
now
one
saw
the
reign
of
the
caliphates
of
commerce
the
despotism
of
the
rue
du
sentier
the
tyranny
of
trade
bringing
in
its
train
venal
narrow
ideas
knavish
and
vain
instincts
viler
and
more
dishonest
than
the
nobility
despoiled
and
the
decayed
clergy
the
bourgeoisie
borrowed
their
frivolous
ostentations
their
braggadoccio
degrading
these
qualities
by
its
lack
of
the
bourgeoisie
stole
their
faults
and
converted
them
into
hypocritical
vices
and
authoritative
and
sly
low
and
cowardly
it
pitilessly
attacked
its
eternal
and
necessary
dupe
the
populace
unmuzzled
and
placed
in
ambush
so
as
to
be
in
readiness
to
assault
the
old
castes
it
was
now
an
acknowledged
fact
its
task
once
terminated
the
proletariat
had
been
bled
supposedly
as
a
measure
of
hygiene
the
bourgeoisie
reassured
strutted
about
in
good
humor
thanks
to
its
wealth
and
the
contagion
of
its
stupidity
the
result
of
its
accession
to
power
had
been
the
destruction
of
all
intelligence
the
negation
of
all
honesty
the
death
of
all
art
and
in
fact
the
debased
artists
had
fallen
on
their
knees
and
they
eagerly
kissed
the
dirty
feet
of
the
eminent
jobbers
and
low
satraps
whose
alms
permitted
them
to
live
in
painting
one
now
beheld
a
deluge
of
silliness
in
literature
an
intemperate
mixture
of
dull
style
and
cowardly
ideas
for
they
had
to
credit
the
business
man
with
honesty
the
buccaneer
who
purchased
a
dot
for
his
son
and
refused
to
pay
that
of
his
daughter
with
virtue
chaste
love
to
the
voltairian
agnostic
who
accused
the
clergy
of
rapes
and
then
went
hypocritically
and
stupidly
to
sniff
in
the
obscene
chambers
it
was
the
great
american
hulks
transported
to
our
continent
it
was
the
immense
the
profound
the
incommensurable
peasantry
of
the
financier
and
the
parvenu
beaming
like
a
pitiful
sun
upon
the
idolatrous
town
which
wallowed
on
the
ground
the
while
it
uttered
impure
psalms
before
the
impious
tabernacle
of
banks
well
then
society
crash
to
ruin
die
aged
world
cried
des
esseintes
angered
by
the
ignominy
of
the
spectacle
he
had
evoked
this
cry
of
hate
broke
the
nightmare
that
oppressed
him
ah
he
exclaimed
to
think
that
all
this
is
not
a
dream
to
think
that
i
am
going
to
return
into
the
cowardly
and
servile
crowd
of
this
century
to
console
himself
he
recalled
the
comforting
maxims
of
schopenhauer
and
repeated
to
himself
the
sad
axiom
of
pascal
the
soul
is
pained
by
all
things
it
thinks
upon
but
the
words
resounded
in
his
mind
like
sounds
deprived
of
sense
his
ennui
disintegrated
lifting
all
significance
from
the
words
all
healing
virtue
all
effective
and
gentle
vigor
he
came
at
last
to
perceive
that
the
reasonings
of
pessimism
availed
little
in
comforting
him
that
impossible
faith
in
a
future
life
alone
would
pacify
him
an
access
of
rage
swept
aside
like
a
hurricane
his
attempts
at
resignation
and
indifference
he
could
no
longer
conceal
the
hideous
truth
nothing
was
left
all
was
in
ruins
the
bourgeoisie
were
gormandizing
on
the
solemn
ruins
of
the
church
which
had
become
a
place
of
a
mass
of
rubbish
soiled
by
petty
puns
and
scandalous
jests
were
the
terrible
god
of
genesis
and
the
pale
christ
of
golgotha
not
going
to
prove
their
existence
by
commanding
the
cataclysms
of
yore
by
rekindling
the
flames
that
once
consumed
the
sinful
cities
was
this
degradation
to
continue
to
flow
and
cover
with
its
pestilence
the
old
world
planted
with
seeds
of
iniquities
and
shames
the
door
was
suddenly
opened
men
appeared
bringing
chests
and
carrying
the
furniture
then
the
door
closed
once
more
on
the
servant
who
was
removing
packages
of
books
des
esseintes
sank
into
a
chair
i
shall
be
in
paris
in
two
days
well
all
is
finished
the
waves
of
human
mediocrity
rise
to
the
sky
and
they
will
engulf
the
refuge
whose
dams
i
open
ah
courage
leaves
me
my
heart
breaks
o
lord
pity
the
christian
who
doubts
the
sceptic
who
would
believe
the
convict
of
life
embarking
alone
in
the
night
under
a
sky
no
longer
illumined
by
the
consoling
beacons
of
ancient
faith
