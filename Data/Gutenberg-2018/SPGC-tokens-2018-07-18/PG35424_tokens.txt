the
amethyst
box
i
the
flask
which
held
but
a
drop
it
was
the
night
before
the
wedding
though
sinclair
and
not
myself
was
the
happy
man
i
had
my
own
causes
for
excitement
and
finding
the
heat
of
the
insupportable
i
sought
the
veranda
for
a
solitary
smoke
in
sight
of
the
ocean
and
a
full
moon
i
was
in
a
condition
of
rapturous
if
unreasoning
delight
that
afternoon
a
little
hand
had
lingered
in
mine
for
just
an
instant
longer
than
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
strictly
required
and
small
as
the
favor
may
seem
to
those
who
do
not
know
dorothy
camerden
to
me
who
realized
fully
both
her
delicacy
and
pride
it
was
a
sign
that
my
long
if
secret
devotion
was
about
to
be
rewarded
and
that
at
last
i
was
free
to
cherish
hopes
whose
alternative
had
once
bid
fair
to
wreck
the
happiness
of
my
life
i
was
reveling
in
the
felicity
of
these
anticipations
and
contrasting
this
hour
of
ardent
hope
with
others
of
whose
dissatisfaction
and
gloom
i
was
yet
mindful
when
a
sudden
shadow
fell
across
the
broad
band
of
light
issuing
from
the
library
window
and
sinclair
stepped
out
he
had
the
appearance
of
being
disturbed
very
much
disturbed
i
thought
for
a
man
on
the
point
of
marrying
the
woman
for
whom
he
professed
to
entertain
the
one
profound
passion
of
his
life
but
remembering
his
frequent
causes
of
annoyance
causes
quite
apart
from
his
bride
and
her
personal
attributes
i
kept
on
placidly
smoking
till
i
felt
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
turned
to
see
that
the
moment
was
a
serious
one
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
he
whispered
come
where
we
shall
run
less
risk
of
being
disturbed
what
wrong
i
asked
facing
him
with
curiosity
if
not
with
alarm
i
never
saw
you
look
like
this
before
has
the
old
lady
taken
this
last
minute
to
hush
he
prayed
emphasizing
the
word
with
a
curt
gesture
not
to
be
mistaken
the
little
room
over
the
west
porch
is
empty
just
now
follow
me
there
with
a
sigh
for
the
cigar
i
had
so
lately
lighted
i
tossed
it
into
the
bushes
and
sauntered
in
after
him
i
thought
i
understood
his
trouble
the
prospective
bride
was
young
a
mere
slip
of
a
girl
indeed
bright
beautiful
and
proud
yet
with
odd
little
restraints
in
her
manner
and
language
due
probably
to
her
peculiar
bringing
up
and
the
surprise
not
yet
overcome
of
finding
herself
after
an
isolated
if
not
despised
childhood
the
idol
of
society
and
the
recipient
of
general
homage
the
fault
was
not
with
her
but
she
had
for
guardian
alas
my
dear
girl
had
the
same
an
aunt
who
was
a
gorgon
this
aunt
must
have
been
making
herself
disagreeable
to
the
prospective
bridegroom
and
he
being
quick
to
take
offense
quicker
than
myself
it
was
said
had
probably
retorted
in
a
way
to
make
things
unpleasant
as
he
was
a
guest
in
the
house
he
and
all
the
other
members
of
the
bridal
party
armstrong
having
insisted
upon
opening
her
magnificent
newport
villa
for
this
wedding
and
its
attendant
festivities
the
matter
might
well
look
black
to
him
yet
i
did
not
feel
disposed
to
take
much
interest
in
it
even
though
his
case
might
be
mine
some
day
with
all
its
accompanying
drawbacks
but
once
confronted
with
sinclair
in
the
room
above
i
perceived
that
i
had
better
drop
all
selfish
regrets
and
give
my
full
attention
to
what
he
had
to
say
for
his
eye
which
had
flashed
with
an
unusual
light
at
dinner
was
clouded
now
and
his
manner
when
he
strove
to
speak
betrayed
a
nervousness
i
had
considered
foreign
to
his
nature
ever
since
the
day
i
had
seen
him
rein
in
his
horse
so
calmly
on
the
extreme
edge
of
a
precipice
where
a
fall
would
have
meant
certain
death
not
only
to
himself
but
also
to
the
two
riders
who
unwittingly
were
pressing
closely
behind
him
walter
he
faltered
something
has
happened
something
dreadful
something
unprecedented
you
may
think
me
a
fool
god
knows
i
would
be
glad
to
be
proved
so
but
this
thing
has
frightened
me
i
he
paused
and
pulled
himself
together
i
will
tell
you
about
it
then
you
can
judge
for
yourself
i
am
in
no
condition
to
do
so
i
wonder
if
you
will
be
when
you
hear
do
beat
about
the
bush
speak
up
what
the
matter
he
gave
me
an
odd
look
full
of
gloom
a
look
i
felt
the
force
of
though
i
could
not
interpret
it
then
coming
closer
though
there
was
no
one
within
hearing
possibly
no
one
any
nearer
than
the
below
he
whispered
in
my
ear
i
have
lost
a
little
vial
of
the
deadliest
drug
ever
compounded
a
venetian
curiosity
which
i
was
foolish
enough
to
take
out
and
show
the
ladies
because
the
little
box
which
holds
it
is
such
an
exquisite
example
of
jewelers
work
there
death
in
its
taste
almost
in
its
smell
and
it
out
of
my
hands
and
well
i
tell
you
how
to
fix
that
up
i
put
in
with
my
usual
frank
decision
order
the
music
stopped
call
everybody
into
the
and
explain
the
dangerous
nature
of
this
toy
after
which
if
anything
happens
it
will
not
be
your
fault
but
that
of
the
person
who
has
so
thoughtlessly
appropriated
it
his
eyes
which
had
been
resting
eagerly
on
mine
shifted
aside
in
visible
embarrassment
impossible
it
would
only
aggravate
matters
or
rather
would
not
relieve
my
fears
at
all
the
person
who
took
it
knew
its
nature
very
well
and
that
person
oh
then
you
know
who
took
it
i
broke
in
in
increasing
astonishment
i
thought
from
your
manner
that
no
he
moodily
corrected
i
do
not
know
who
took
it
if
i
did
i
should
not
be
here
that
is
i
do
not
know
the
exact
person
only
here
he
again
eyed
me
with
his
former
singular
intentness
and
observing
that
i
was
nettled
made
a
fresh
beginning
when
i
came
here
i
brought
with
me
a
case
of
rarities
chosen
from
my
various
collections
in
looking
over
them
preparatory
to
making
a
present
to
gilbertine
i
came
across
the
little
box
i
have
just
mentioned
it
is
made
of
a
single
amethyst
and
contains
or
so
i
was
assured
when
i
bought
it
a
tiny
flask
of
old
but
very
deadly
poison
how
it
came
to
be
included
with
the
other
precious
and
beautiful
articles
i
had
picked
out
for
her
i
can
not
say
but
there
it
was
and
conceiving
that
the
sight
of
it
would
please
the
ladies
i
carried
it
down
into
the
library
and
in
an
evil
hour
called
three
or
four
of
those
about
me
to
inspect
it
this
was
while
you
boys
were
in
the
so
the
ladies
could
give
their
entire
attention
to
the
little
box
which
is
certainly
worth
the
most
careful
scrutiny
i
was
holding
it
out
on
the
palm
of
my
hand
where
it
burned
with
a
purple
light
which
made
more
than
one
feminine
eye
glitter
when
somebody
inquired
to
what
use
so
small
and
yet
so
rich
a
receptacle
could
be
put
the
question
was
such
a
natural
one
i
never
thought
of
evading
it
besides
i
enjoy
the
fearsome
delight
which
women
take
in
the
marvelous
expecting
no
greater
result
than
lifted
eyebrows
or
flushed
cheeks
i
answered
by
pressing
a
little
spring
in
the
surrounding
the
gem
instantly
the
tiniest
of
lids
flew
back
revealing
a
crystal
flask
of
such
minute
proportions
that
the
usual
astonishment
followed
its
disclosure
see
i
cried
was
made
to
hold
and
moving
my
hand
to
and
fro
under
the
i
caused
to
shine
in
their
eyes
the
single
drop
of
yellow
liquid
it
still
held
i
impressively
announced
trinket
may
have
adorned
the
bosom
of
a
borgia
or
flashed
from
the
arm
of
some
great
venetian
lady
as
she
flourished
her
fan
between
her
embittered
heart
and
the
object
of
her
wrath
or
jealousy
the
first
sentence
had
come
naturally
but
the
last
was
spoken
at
random
and
almost
unconsciously
for
at
the
utterance
of
the
word
a
quickly
suppressed
cry
had
escaped
the
lips
of
some
one
behind
me
which
while
faint
enough
to
elude
the
attention
of
any
ear
less
sensitive
than
my
own
contained
such
an
astonishing
if
involuntary
note
of
that
my
mind
grew
numb
with
horror
and
i
stood
staring
at
the
fearful
toy
which
had
called
up
such
a
revelation
of
what
that
is
what
i
am
here
to
ask
first
of
myself
then
of
you
for
the
two
women
pressing
behind
me
were
who
i
sharply
demanded
partaking
in
some
indefinable
way
of
his
excitement
and
alarm
gilbertine
murray
and
dorothy
camerden
his
prospective
bride
and
the
woman
i
loved
and
whom
he
knew
i
loved
though
i
had
kept
my
secret
quite
successfully
from
every
one
else
the
look
we
exchanged
neither
of
us
will
ever
forget
describe
the
sound
i
presently
said
i
can
not
he
replied
i
can
only
give
you
my
impression
of
it
you
like
myself
fought
in
more
than
one
skirmish
in
the
cuban
war
did
you
ever
hear
the
cry
made
by
a
wounded
man
when
the
cup
of
cool
water
for
which
he
has
long
agonized
is
brought
suddenly
before
his
eyes
such
a
sound
with
all
that
goes
to
make
it
eloquent
did
i
hear
from
one
of
the
two
girls
who
leaned
over
my
shoulder
can
you
understand
this
amazing
this
circumstance
can
you
name
the
woman
can
you
name
the
grief
capable
of
making
either
of
these
seemingly
happy
and
innocent
girls
hail
the
sight
of
such
a
doubtful
panacea
with
an
unconscious
ebullition
of
joy
you
would
clear
my
of
a
great
dread
if
you
could
for
if
this
expression
of
concealed
misery
came
from
gilbertine
do
you
mean
i
cried
in
vehement
protest
that
you
really
are
in
doubt
as
to
which
of
these
two
women
uttered
the
cry
which
so
startled
you
that
you
positively
can
not
tell
whether
it
was
gilbertine
or
or
i
can
not
as
god
lives
i
can
not
i
was
too
dazed
too
confounded
by
the
unexpected
circumstance
to
turn
at
once
and
when
i
did
it
was
to
see
both
pairs
of
eyes
shining
and
both
faces
dimpling
with
real
or
affected
gaiety
indeed
if
the
matter
had
stopped
there
i
should
have
thought
myself
the
victim
of
some
monstrous
delusion
but
when
a
later
i
found
this
box
missing
from
the
cabinet
where
i
had
hastily
thrust
it
at
the
peremptory
summons
of
our
hostess
i
knew
that
i
had
not
misunderstood
the
nature
of
the
cry
i
had
heard
that
it
was
indeed
one
of
secret
longing
and
that
the
hand
had
simply
taken
what
the
heart
desired
if
a
death
occurs
in
this
house
sinclair
you
are
mad
i
exclaimed
with
great
violence
no
lesser
word
would
fit
either
the
intensity
of
my
feeling
or
the
confused
state
of
my
mind
death
where
all
are
so
happy
remember
your
ingenuous
face
remember
the
candid
expression
of
dorothy
eye
her
smile
her
noble
ways
you
exaggerate
the
situation
you
neither
understand
aright
the
simple
expression
of
surprise
you
heard
nor
the
feminine
frolic
which
led
these
girls
to
carry
off
this
romantic
specimen
of
italian
deviltry
you
are
losing
time
was
his
simple
comment
every
minute
we
allow
to
pass
in
inaction
only
brings
the
danger
nearer
what
you
imagine
i
imagine
nothing
i
simply
know
that
one
of
these
girls
has
in
her
possession
the
means
of
terminating
life
in
an
instant
that
the
girl
so
having
it
is
not
happy
and
that
if
anything
happens
it
will
be
because
we
rested
supine
in
the
face
of
a
very
real
and
possible
danger
now
as
gilbertine
has
never
given
me
reason
to
doubt
either
her
affection
for
myself
or
her
satisfaction
in
our
approaching
union
i
have
allowed
myself
to
think
that
the
object
of
your
fears
is
dorothy
i
finished
with
a
laugh
i
vainly
strove
to
make
sarcastic
he
did
not
answer
and
i
stood
battling
with
a
dread
i
could
neither
conceal
nor
avow
for
preposterous
as
his
idea
was
reason
told
me
that
he
had
some
grounds
for
his
doubt
dorothy
unlike
gilbertine
murray
was
not
to
be
read
at
a
glance
and
her
trouble
for
she
certainly
had
a
trouble
was
not
one
she
chose
to
share
with
any
one
even
with
me
i
had
flattered
myself
in
days
gone
by
that
i
understood
it
well
enough
and
that
any
lack
of
sincerity
i
might
observe
in
her
could
be
easily
explained
by
the
position
of
dependence
she
held
toward
an
irascible
aunt
but
now
that
i
forced
myself
to
consider
the
matter
carefully
i
could
not
but
ask
if
the
varying
moods
by
which
i
had
found
myself
secretly
harrowed
had
not
sprung
from
a
very
different
cause
a
cause
for
which
my
persistent
love
was
more
to
blame
than
the
temper
of
her
relative
the
aversion
she
had
once
shown
to
my
attentions
had
yielded
long
ago
to
a
shy
but
seemingly
sincere
appreciation
of
them
and
gleams
of
what
i
was
fain
to
call
real
feeling
had
shown
themselves
now
and
then
in
her
softened
manner
culminating
in
that
soft
pressure
of
my
hand
which
had
awakened
my
hopes
and
made
me
forget
all
the
doubts
and
caprices
of
a
disturbing
courtship
but
had
i
interpreted
that
strong
nervous
pressure
aright
had
it
necessarily
meant
love
might
it
not
have
sprung
from
a
sudden
desperate
resolution
to
accept
a
devotion
which
offered
her
a
way
out
of
difficulties
especially
galling
to
one
of
her
gentle
but
lofty
spirit
her
expression
when
she
caught
my
look
of
joy
had
little
of
the
demure
tenderness
of
a
maiden
blushing
at
her
first
involuntary
avowal
there
was
shrinking
in
it
but
it
was
the
shrinking
of
a
frightened
woman
not
of
an
abashed
girl
and
when
i
strove
to
follow
her
the
gesture
with
which
she
waved
me
back
had
that
in
it
which
would
have
alarmed
a
more
exacting
lover
had
i
mistaken
my
darling
feelings
was
her
heart
still
cold
her
affection
unwon
or
thought
insupportable
had
she
secretly
yielded
to
another
what
she
had
so
long
denied
me
and
ah
quoth
sinclair
at
this
juncture
i
see
that
i
have
roused
you
at
last
and
unconsciously
his
tone
grew
lighter
and
his
eye
lost
the
strained
look
which
had
made
it
the
eye
of
a
stranger
you
begin
to
see
that
a
question
of
the
most
serious
import
is
before
us
and
that
this
question
must
be
answered
before
we
separate
for
the
night
i
do
said
i
his
relief
was
evident
then
so
much
is
gained
the
next
point
is
how
are
we
to
settle
our
doubts
we
can
not
approach
either
of
these
ladies
with
questions
a
girl
wretched
enough
to
contemplate
suicide
would
be
especially
careful
to
conceal
both
her
misery
and
its
cause
neither
can
we
order
a
search
made
for
an
object
so
small
that
it
can
be
concealed
about
the
person
yet
this
jewel
must
be
recovered
listen
sinclair
i
will
have
a
talk
with
dorothy
you
with
gilbertine
a
kind
talk
mind
you
one
that
will
soothe
not
frighten
if
a
secret
lurks
in
either
breast
our
tenderness
should
find
it
out
only
as
you
love
me
promise
to
show
me
the
same
frankness
i
here
promise
to
show
you
dear
as
dorothy
is
to
me
i
swear
to
communicate
to
you
the
full
result
of
my
conversation
with
her
whatever
the
cost
to
myself
or
even
to
her
and
i
will
be
equally
fair
as
regards
gilbertine
but
before
we
proceed
to
such
extreme
measures
let
us
make
sure
that
there
is
no
shorter
road
to
the
truth
some
one
may
have
seen
which
of
our
two
dear
girls
went
back
to
the
library
after
we
all
came
out
of
it
that
would
narrow
down
our
inquiry
and
save
one
of
them
at
least
from
unnecessary
disturbance
it
was
a
happy
thought
and
i
told
him
so
but
at
the
same
time
bade
him
look
in
the
glass
and
see
how
impossible
it
would
be
for
him
to
venture
below
without
creating
an
alarm
which
might
precipitate
the
dread
event
we
both
feared
he
replied
by
drawing
me
to
his
side
before
the
mirror
and
pointing
to
my
own
face
it
was
as
pale
as
his
own
most
disagreeably
impressed
by
this
i
colored
deeply
under
sinclair
eye
and
was
but
little
if
any
relieved
when
i
noticed
that
he
colored
under
mine
for
his
feelings
were
no
enigma
to
me
naturally
he
was
glad
to
discover
that
i
shared
his
apprehensions
since
it
gave
him
leave
to
hope
that
the
blow
he
so
dreaded
was
not
necessarily
directed
toward
his
own
affections
yet
being
a
generous
fellow
he
blushed
to
be
detected
in
his
egotism
while
i
well
i
own
that
at
that
moment
i
should
have
felt
a
very
unmixed
joy
at
being
assured
that
the
foundations
of
my
own
love
were
secure
and
that
the
tiny
flask
sinclair
had
missed
had
not
been
taken
by
the
hand
of
the
one
to
whom
i
looked
for
all
my
earthly
happiness
and
my
was
as
yet
a
vague
and
distant
hope
while
his
was
set
for
the
morrow
we
must
carry
down
stairs
very
different
faces
from
these
he
remarked
or
we
shall
be
stopped
before
we
reach
the
library
i
made
an
effort
at
composure
so
did
he
and
both
being
determined
men
we
soon
found
ourselves
in
a
condition
to
descend
among
our
friends
without
attracting
any
closer
attention
than
was
naturally
due
him
as
prospective
bridegroom
and
myself
as
best
man
ii
beaton
dream
armstrong
our
hostess
was
fond
of
gaiety
and
amusements
were
never
lacking
as
we
stepped
down
into
the
great
hall
we
heard
music
in
the
and
saw
that
a
dance
was
in
progress
that
is
good
observed
sinclair
we
shall
run
less
risk
of
finding
the
library
occupied
shall
i
not
look
and
see
where
the
girls
are
it
would
be
a
great
relief
to
find
them
both
among
the
dancers
yes
said
he
but
do
allow
yourself
to
be
inveigled
into
joining
them
i
could
not
stand
the
suspense
i
nodded
and
slipped
toward
the
he
remained
in
the
overlooking
the
terrace
a
rush
of
young
people
greeted
me
as
soon
as
i
showed
myself
but
i
was
able
to
elude
them
and
catch
the
one
full
glimpse
i
wanted
of
the
great
room
beyond
it
was
a
magnificent
apartment
and
so
brilliantly
lighted
that
every
nook
stood
revealed
on
a
divan
near
the
center
was
a
lady
conversing
with
two
gentlemen
her
back
was
toward
me
but
i
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
miss
murray
some
distance
from
her
but
with
her
face
also
turned
away
stood
dorothy
she
was
talking
with
an
unmarried
friend
and
appeared
quite
at
ease
and
more
than
usually
cheerful
relieved
yet
sorry
that
i
had
not
succeeded
in
catching
a
glimpse
of
their
faces
i
hastened
back
to
sinclair
who
was
watching
me
with
furtive
eyes
from
between
the
curtains
of
the
window
in
which
he
had
secreted
himself
as
i
joined
him
a
young
man
who
was
to
act
as
usher
sauntered
from
behind
one
of
the
great
pillars
forming
a
colonnade
down
the
hall
and
crossing
to
where
the
door
stood
invitingly
open
disappeared
behind
it
with
the
air
of
a
man
perfectly
contented
with
his
surroundings
with
a
nervous
grip
sinclair
seized
me
by
the
arm
was
that
beaton
he
asked
certainly
did
you
recognize
him
he
gave
me
a
very
strange
look
does
the
sight
of
him
recall
anything
no
you
were
at
the
yesterday
morning
i
was
do
you
remember
the
dream
he
related
for
the
delectation
of
such
as
would
listen
then
it
was
my
turn
to
go
white
you
do
mean
i
began
i
thought
at
the
time
that
it
sounded
more
like
a
veritable
adventure
than
a
dream
now
i
am
sure
that
it
was
such
sinclair
you
do
not
mean
that
the
young
girl
he
professed
himself
to
have
surprised
one
moonlit
night
standing
on
the
verge
of
the
cliff
with
arms
upstretched
and
a
distracted
air
was
a
real
person
i
do
we
laughed
at
the
time
he
made
it
seem
so
tragic
and
preposterous
i
do
not
feel
like
laughing
now
i
gazed
at
sinclair
in
horror
the
music
was
throbbing
in
our
ears
and
the
murmur
of
gay
voices
and
swiftly
moving
feet
suggested
nothing
but
joy
and
hilarity
which
was
the
dream
this
scene
of
seeming
mirth
and
happy
promise
or
the
fancies
he
had
conjured
up
to
rob
us
both
of
peace
beaton
mentioned
no
names
i
stubbornly
protested
he
did
not
even
call
the
vision
he
encountered
a
woman
it
was
a
wraith
you
remember
a
a
creature
of
his
own
imagination
born
of
some
tragedy
he
had
read
beaton
is
a
gentleman
was
sinclair
cold
reply
he
did
not
wish
to
injure
but
to
warn
the
woman
for
whose
benefit
he
told
his
tale
warn
he
doubtless
reasoned
in
this
way
if
he
could
make
this
young
and
probably
sensitive
girl
realize
that
she
had
been
seen
and
her
intentions
recognized
she
would
beware
of
such
attempts
in
the
future
he
is
a
fellow
did
you
notice
which
end
of
the
table
he
ignored
when
relating
this
dramatic
episode
no
if
you
had
we
might
be
better
able
to
judge
where
his
thoughts
were
probably
you
can
not
even
tell
how
the
ladies
took
it
no
i
never
thought
of
looking
good
god
sinclair
do
let
us
harrow
up
ourselves
unnecessarily
i
saw
them
both
a
moment
ago
and
nothing
in
their
manner
showed
that
anything
was
amiss
with
either
of
them
for
answer
he
drew
me
toward
the
library
this
room
was
not
frequented
by
the
young
people
at
night
there
were
two
or
three
elderly
people
in
the
party
notably
the
husband
and
the
brother
of
the
lady
of
the
house
and
to
their
use
the
room
was
more
or
less
given
up
after
nightfall
sinclair
wished
to
show
me
the
cabinet
where
the
box
had
been
there
was
a
fire
in
the
grate
for
the
evenings
were
now
more
or
less
chilly
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
us
we
found
that
this
same
fire
made
all
the
light
there
was
in
the
room
both
had
been
put
out
and
the
rich
yet
room
glowed
with
ruddy
hues
interspersed
with
great
shadows
a
solitary
scene
yet
an
enticing
one
sinclair
drew
a
deep
breath
armstrong
must
have
gone
elsewhere
to
read
the
evening
papers
he
remarked
i
replied
by
casting
a
scrutinizing
look
into
the
corners
i
dreaded
finding
a
pair
of
lovers
hid
somewhere
in
the
many
nooks
made
by
the
jutting
but
i
saw
no
one
however
at
the
other
end
of
the
large
room
there
stood
a
screen
near
one
of
the
many
lounges
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
approaching
this
place
of
concealment
when
sinclair
drew
me
toward
a
tall
cabinet
upon
whose
glass
doors
the
firelight
was
shimmering
and
pointing
to
a
shelf
far
above
our
heads
cried
no
woman
could
reach
that
unaided
gilbertine
is
tall
but
not
tall
enough
for
that
i
purposely
put
it
high
illustration
i
looked
about
for
a
stool
there
was
one
just
behind
sinclair
i
drew
his
attention
to
it
he
flushed
and
gave
it
a
kick
then
shivered
slightly
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
i
knew
what
he
was
thinking
gilbertine
was
taller
than
dorothy
this
stool
might
have
served
gilbertine
if
not
dorothy
i
felt
a
great
sympathy
for
him
after
all
his
case
was
more
serious
than
mine
the
bishop
was
coming
to
marry
him
the
next
day
sinclair
said
i
the
stool
means
nothing
dorothy
has
more
inches
than
you
think
with
this
under
her
feet
she
could
reach
the
shelf
by
standing
tiptoe
besides
there
are
the
chairs
true
true
and
he
started
up
there
are
the
chairs
i
forgot
the
chairs
i
fear
my
wits
have
gone
we
shall
have
to
take
others
into
our
confidence
here
his
voice
fell
to
a
whisper
somehow
or
by
some
means
we
must
find
out
if
either
of
them
was
seen
to
come
into
this
room
leave
that
to
me
said
i
remember
that
a
word
might
raise
suspicion
and
that
in
a
case
like
this
halloo
what
that
a
gentle
snore
had
come
from
behind
the
screen
we
are
not
alone
i
whispered
some
one
is
over
there
on
the
lounge
sinclair
had
already
bounded
across
the
room
i
pressed
hurriedly
behind
him
and
together
we
rounded
the
screen
and
came
upon
the
recumbent
figure
of
armstrong
asleep
on
the
lounge
with
his
paper
fallen
from
his
hand
that
accounts
for
the
lights
being
turned
out
grumbled
sinclair
dutton
must
have
done
it
dutton
was
the
butler
i
stood
contemplating
the
sleeping
figure
before
me
he
must
have
been
lying
here
for
some
time
i
muttered
sinclair
started
probably
some
little
while
before
he
slept
i
pursued
i
have
often
heard
that
he
dotes
on
the
firelight
i
have
a
notion
to
wake
him
suggested
sinclair
it
will
not
be
necessary
said
i
drawing
back
as
the
heavy
figure
stirred
breathed
heavily
and
finally
sat
up
i
beg
pardon
i
now
entreated
backing
politely
away
we
thought
the
room
empty
armstrong
who
if
slow
to
receive
impressions
is
far
from
lacking
intelligence
eyed
us
with
sleepy
indifference
for
a
moment
then
rose
ponderously
to
his
feet
and
was
on
the
instant
the
man
of
manner
and
unfailing
courtesy
we
had
ever
found
him
what
can
i
do
to
oblige
you
he
asked
his
smooth
if
hesitating
tones
sounding
strange
to
our
excited
ears
i
made
haste
to
forestall
sinclair
who
was
racking
his
brains
for
words
with
which
to
propound
the
question
he
dared
not
put
too
boldly
pardon
me
armstrong
we
were
looking
about
for
a
small
pin
dropped
by
miss
camerden
how
hard
it
was
for
me
to
use
her
name
in
this
connection
only
my
own
heart
knew
she
was
in
here
just
now
was
she
not
the
courteous
gentleman
bowed
hawed
and
smiled
a
very
polite
but
unmeaning
smile
evidently
he
had
not
the
remotest
notion
whether
she
had
been
in
or
not
i
am
sorry
but
i
am
afraid
i
lost
myself
for
a
moment
on
that
lounge
he
admitted
the
firelight
always
makes
me
sleepy
but
if
i
can
help
you
he
cried
starting
forward
but
almost
immediately
pausing
again
and
giving
us
rather
a
curious
look
some
one
was
in
the
room
i
remember
it
now
it
was
just
before
the
warmth
and
glow
of
the
fire
became
too
much
for
me
i
can
not
say
that
it
was
miss
camerden
however
i
thought
it
was
some
one
of
quicker
movement
she
made
quite
a
rattle
with
the
chairs
i
purposely
did
not
look
back
at
sinclair
miss
murray
i
suggested
armstrong
made
one
of
his
low
bows
this
i
doubt
not
was
out
of
deference
to
the
does
miss
murray
wear
white
yes
muttered
sinclair
coming
hastily
forward
then
it
may
have
been
she
for
as
i
lay
there
deciding
whether
or
not
to
yield
to
the
agreeable
somnolence
i
felt
creeping
over
me
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
skirt
as
she
passed
out
of
the
room
and
that
skirt
was
white
white
silk
i
suppose
you
call
it
it
looked
very
pretty
in
the
firelight
sinclair
turning
on
his
heel
stalked
in
a
dazed
way
toward
the
door
to
cover
this
show
of
abruptness
which
was
quite
unusual
on
his
part
i
made
the
effort
of
my
life
and
remarking
lightly
she
must
have
been
here
looking
for
the
pin
her
friend
has
lost
i
launched
forth
into
an
impromptu
dissertation
on
one
of
the
subjects
i
knew
to
be
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
bookworm
before
me
and
kept
it
up
too
till
i
saw
by
his
brightening
eye
and
suddenly
freed
manner
that
he
had
forgotten
the
insignificant
episode
of
a
minute
ago
never
in
all
probability
to
recall
it
again
then
i
made
another
effort
and
released
myself
with
something
like
deftness
from
the
argument
i
saw
impending
and
making
for
the
door
in
my
turn
glanced
about
for
sinclair
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
the
question
as
to
who
had
taken
the
box
from
the
library
was
settled
it
was
now
eight
i
made
my
way
from
room
to
room
and
from
group
to
group
looking
for
sinclair
at
last
i
returned
to
my
old
post
near
the
library
door
and
was
instantly
rewarded
by
the
sight
of
his
figure
approaching
from
a
small
side
passage
in
company
with
the
butler
dutton
his
face
as
he
stepped
into
the
full
light
of
the
open
hall
showed
discomposure
but
not
the
extreme
distress
i
had
anticipated
somehow
at
sight
of
it
i
found
myself
seeking
the
shadow
just
as
he
had
done
a
short
time
before
and
it
was
in
one
of
the
recesses
made
by
a
row
of
bay
trees
that
we
came
face
to
face
he
gave
me
one
look
then
his
eyes
dropped
miss
camerden
has
lost
a
pin
from
her
hair
he
impressively
explained
to
me
then
turning
to
dutton
he
nonchalantly
remarked
it
must
be
somewhere
in
this
hall
perhaps
you
will
be
good
enough
to
look
for
it
certainly
replied
the
man
i
thought
she
had
lost
something
when
i
saw
her
come
out
of
the
library
a
little
while
ago
holding
her
hand
to
her
hair
my
heart
gave
a
leap
then
sank
cold
and
almost
pulseless
in
my
breast
in
the
hum
to
which
all
sounds
had
sunk
i
heard
sinclair
voice
rise
again
in
the
question
with
which
my
own
mind
was
full
when
was
that
after
armstrong
went
into
the
room
or
before
oh
after
he
fell
asleep
i
had
just
come
from
putting
out
the
gas
when
i
saw
miss
camerden
slip
in
and
almost
immediately
come
out
again
i
will
search
for
the
pin
very
carefully
sir
so
armstrong
had
made
a
mistake
it
was
dorothy
and
not
gilbertine
whom
he
had
seen
leaving
the
room
i
braced
myself
up
and
met
eye
dorothy
dress
is
gray
but
armstrong
eye
may
not
be
very
good
for
colors
it
is
possible
that
both
were
in
the
room
was
sinclair
reply
but
i
could
see
that
he
advanced
this
theory
solely
out
of
consideration
for
me
that
he
did
not
really
believe
it
at
all
events
he
went
on
we
can
not
prove
anything
this
way
we
must
revert
to
our
original
idea
i
wonder
if
gilbertine
will
give
me
the
chance
to
speak
to
her
you
will
have
an
easier
task
than
i
was
my
retort
if
dorothy
perceives
that
i
wish
to
approach
her
she
has
but
to
lift
her
eyes
to
any
of
the
fellows
here
and
the
thing
becomes
impossible
there
is
to
be
a
rehearsal
of
the
ceremony
at
ten
i
might
get
a
word
in
then
only
this
matter
must
be
settled
first
i
could
never
go
through
the
farce
of
standing
up
before
you
all
at
side
with
such
a
doubt
as
this
in
my
mind
you
will
see
her
before
then
insist
on
a
moment
talk
if
she
refuses
hush
he
here
put
in
we
part
now
to
meet
in
this
same
place
again
at
ten
do
i
look
fit
to
enter
among
the
dancers
i
see
a
whole
group
of
them
coming
for
me
you
will
in
another
moment
approaching
matrimony
has
made
you
sober
that
all
it
was
some
time
before
i
had
the
opportunity
even
if
i
had
the
courage
to
look
dorothy
in
the
face
when
the
moment
came
she
was
flushed
with
dancing
and
looked
beautiful
ordinarily
she
was
a
little
pale
but
not
even
gilbertine
with
her
sumptuous
coloring
showed
a
warmer
cheek
than
she
as
resting
from
the
waltz
she
leaned
against
the
wall
and
let
her
eyes
for
the
first
time
rise
slowly
to
where
i
stood
talking
mechanically
to
my
partner
gentle
eyes
they
were
made
for
appeal
and
eloquent
with
a
subdued
heart
language
but
they
were
held
in
check
by
an
infinite
discretion
never
have
i
caught
them
quite
off
their
guard
and
they
were
wholly
unreadable
yet
she
was
trembling
with
something
more
than
the
fervor
of
the
dance
and
the
little
hand
which
had
touched
mine
in
lingering
pressure
a
few
hours
before
was
not
quiet
for
a
moment
i
could
not
see
it
fluttering
in
and
out
of
the
folds
of
her
dress
without
a
sickening
wonder
if
the
little
purple
box
which
was
the
cause
of
my
horror
lay
somewhere
concealed
amid
the
airy
puffs
and
ruffles
that
rose
and
fell
so
rapidly
over
her
heaving
breast
could
her
eye
rest
on
mine
even
in
this
cold
and
perfunctory
manner
if
the
drop
which
could
separate
us
for
ever
lay
concealed
over
her
heart
she
knew
that
i
loved
her
from
the
first
hour
we
met
in
her
aunt
forbidding
parlor
in
street
she
had
recognized
my
passion
however
perfectly
i
had
succeeded
in
concealing
it
from
others
inexperienced
as
she
was
in
those
days
she
had
noted
as
quickly
as
any
society
belle
the
effect
produced
upon
me
by
her
chill
prettiness
and
her
air
of
meek
reserve
under
which
one
felt
the
and
though
she
would
never
openly
acknowledge
my
homage
and
frowned
down
every
attempt
on
my
part
at
speech
or
attention
i
was
as
sure
that
she
rated
my
feelings
at
their
real
value
as
that
she
was
the
dearest
yet
most
incomprehensible
mortal
my
narrow
world
contained
when
therefore
i
encountered
her
eyes
at
the
end
of
the
dance
i
said
to
myself
she
may
not
love
me
but
she
knows
that
i
love
her
and
being
a
woman
of
sympathetic
instincts
would
never
meet
my
eyes
with
so
calm
a
look
if
she
were
meditating
an
act
which
must
infallibly
plunge
me
into
misery
yet
i
was
not
satisfied
to
go
away
without
a
word
so
taking
the
bull
by
the
horns
i
excused
myself
to
my
partner
and
crossed
to
dorothy
side
will
you
dance
the
next
waltz
with
me
i
asked
her
eyes
fell
from
mine
directly
and
she
drew
back
in
a
way
that
suggested
flight
i
shall
dance
no
more
said
she
her
hand
rising
in
its
nervous
fashion
to
her
hair
i
made
no
appeal
i
just
watched
that
hand
whereupon
she
flushed
vividly
and
seemed
more
than
ever
anxious
to
escape
at
which
i
spoke
again
give
me
a
chance
dorothy
if
you
will
not
dance
come
out
on
the
veranda
and
look
at
the
ocean
it
is
glorious
i
will
not
keep
you
long
the
lights
here
trouble
my
eyes
besides
i
am
most
anxious
to
ask
you
no
no
she
vehemently
objected
very
much
as
if
frightened
i
can
not
leave
the
do
not
ask
me
seek
some
other
partner
do
you
wish
it
very
much
she
was
panting
eager
i
felt
my
heart
sink
and
dreaded
lest
i
should
betray
my
feelings
you
do
not
honor
me
then
with
your
regard
i
retorted
bowing
ceremoniously
as
i
became
assured
that
we
were
attracting
more
attention
than
i
considered
desirable
she
was
silent
her
hand
went
again
to
her
hair
i
changed
my
tone
quietly
but
with
an
emphasis
which
moved
her
in
spite
of
herself
i
whispered
if
i
leave
you
now
will
you
tell
me
why
you
are
so
peremptory
with
me
with
an
eagerness
which
was
anything
but
encouraging
she
answered
with
suddenly
recovered
gaiety
yes
yes
after
all
this
excitement
is
over
and
slipping
her
hand
into
that
of
a
friend
who
was
passing
she
was
soon
in
the
whirl
again
and
dancing
she
who
had
just
assured
me
that
she
did
not
mean
to
dance
again
that
night
iii
a
scream
in
the
night
i
turned
and
hardly
conscious
of
my
actions
stumbled
from
the
room
a
bevy
of
young
people
at
once
surrounded
me
what
i
said
to
them
i
hardly
know
i
only
remember
that
it
was
several
minutes
before
i
found
myself
again
alone
and
making
for
the
little
room
into
which
beaton
had
vanished
a
before
it
was
the
one
given
up
to
did
i
expect
to
find
him
seated
at
one
of
the
tables
possibly
at
all
events
i
approached
the
doorway
and
was
about
to
enter
when
a
heavy
step
shook
the
threshold
before
me
and
i
found
myself
confronted
by
the
advancing
figure
of
an
elderly
lady
whose
portrait
it
is
now
time
for
me
to
draw
it
is
no
pleasurable
task
but
one
i
can
not
escape
imagine
then
a
broad
weighty
woman
of
not
much
height
with
a
face
whose
features
were
usually
forgotten
in
the
impression
made
by
her
great
cheeks
and
falling
jowls
if
the
small
eyes
rested
on
you
you
found
them
sinister
and
strange
but
if
they
were
turned
elsewhere
you
asked
in
what
lay
the
power
of
the
face
and
sought
in
vain
amid
its
long
wrinkles
and
indeterminate
lines
for
the
secret
of
that
spiritual
and
bodily
repulsion
which
the
least
look
into
this
impassive
countenance
was
calculated
to
produce
she
was
a
woman
of
immense
means
and
an
oppressive
consciousness
of
this
spoke
in
every
movement
of
her
heavy
frame
which
always
seemed
to
take
up
three
times
as
much
space
as
rightfully
belonged
to
any
human
creature
add
to
this
that
she
was
seldom
seen
without
a
display
of
diamonds
which
made
her
broad
bust
look
like
the
bejeweled
breast
of
some
eastern
idol
and
some
idea
may
be
formed
of
this
redoubtable
woman
whom
i
have
hitherto
confined
myself
to
speaking
of
as
the
stare
she
gave
me
had
something
venomous
and
threatening
in
it
evidently
for
the
moment
i
was
out
of
her
books
and
while
i
did
not
understand
in
what
way
i
had
displeased
her
for
we
always
had
met
amicably
before
i
seized
upon
this
sign
of
displeasure
on
her
part
as
explanatory
perhaps
of
the
curtness
and
show
of
contradictory
feelings
on
the
part
of
her
dependent
niece
yet
why
should
the
old
woman
frown
on
me
i
had
been
told
more
than
once
that
she
regarded
me
with
great
favor
had
i
unwittingly
done
something
to
displease
her
or
had
the
game
of
cards
she
had
just
left
gone
against
her
ruffling
her
temper
and
making
it
imperative
for
her
to
choose
some
object
on
which
to
vent
her
spite
i
entered
the
room
to
see
two
men
and
one
woman
stood
in
rather
an
embarrassed
silence
about
a
table
on
which
lay
some
cards
which
had
every
appearance
of
having
been
thrown
down
by
an
impatient
hand
one
of
the
men
was
will
beaton
and
it
was
he
who
now
remarked
she
has
just
found
out
that
the
young
people
are
enjoying
themselves
i
wonder
upon
which
of
her
two
unfortunate
nieces
she
will
expend
her
oh
there
no
question
about
that
remarked
the
lady
who
stood
near
him
ever
since
she
has
had
a
reasonable
prospect
of
working
gilbertine
off
her
hands
she
has
devoted
herself
quite
exclusively
to
her
remaining
burden
i
hear
she
impulsively
continued
craning
her
neck
to
be
sure
that
the
object
of
her
remarks
was
quite
out
of
earshot
that
the
south
hall
was
blue
with
the
talk
she
gave
dorothy
camerden
no
one
knows
what
about
for
the
girl
evidently
tries
to
please
her
but
some
women
have
more
than
their
own
proper
share
of
bile
they
must
expend
it
on
some
one
and
she
in
turn
threw
down
her
cards
which
up
till
now
she
had
held
in
her
hand
i
gave
beaton
a
look
and
stepped
out
on
the
veranda
in
a
minute
he
followed
me
and
in
the
corner
facing
the
ocean
where
the
vines
cluster
the
thickest
we
held
our
conversation
i
began
it
with
a
directness
born
of
my
desperation
beaton
said
i
we
have
not
known
each
other
long
but
i
recognize
a
man
when
i
see
him
and
i
am
disposed
to
be
frank
with
you
i
am
in
trouble
my
affections
are
engaged
deeply
engaged
in
a
quarter
where
i
find
some
mystery
you
have
helped
make
it
here
a
gesture
escaped
him
i
allude
to
the
story
you
related
the
other
morning
of
the
young
girl
you
had
seen
hanging
over
the
verge
of
the
cliff
with
every
appearance
of
intending
to
throw
herself
over
it
was
as
a
dream
i
related
that
he
gravely
remarked
that
i
am
aware
of
but
it
was
no
dream
to
me
beaton
i
fear
i
know
that
young
girl
i
also
fear
that
i
know
what
drove
her
into
contemplating
so
rash
an
act
the
conversation
just
held
in
the
should
enlighten
you
beaton
am
i
wrong
the
feeling
i
could
not
suppress
trembled
in
my
tones
he
may
have
been
sensitive
to
it
or
he
may
have
been
simply
whatever
the
cause
this
is
what
he
said
in
reply
it
was
a
dream
remember
that
i
insist
upon
its
being
a
dream
but
some
of
its
details
are
very
clear
in
my
mind
when
i
stumbled
upon
this
in
the
moonlight
her
face
was
turned
from
me
toward
the
ocean
and
i
did
not
see
her
features
then
or
afterwards
startled
by
some
sound
i
made
she
crouched
drew
back
and
fled
to
cover
that
cover
i
have
good
reason
to
believe
was
this
very
house
i
reached
out
my
hand
and
touched
him
on
the
arm
this
was
a
woman
i
inquired
one
of
the
women
now
in
this
house
he
replied
reluctantly
she
was
a
young
woman
and
she
wore
a
long
cloak
my
dream
ends
there
i
can
not
even
say
whether
she
was
fair
or
dark
i
recognized
that
he
had
reached
the
limit
of
his
explanations
and
wringing
his
hand
i
started
for
the
nearest
window
which
proved
to
be
that
of
the
i
was
about
to
enter
when
i
saw
two
women
crossing
to
the
opposite
doorway
and
paused
with
a
full
heart
to
note
them
for
one
was
lansing
and
the
other
dorothy
the
aunt
had
evidently
come
for
the
niece
and
they
were
leaving
the
room
together
not
amicably
however
harsh
words
had
passed
or
i
am
no
judge
of
the
human
countenance
dorothy
especially
bore
herself
like
one
who
finds
difficulty
in
restraining
herself
from
some
unhappy
outburst
and
as
she
disappeared
from
my
sight
in
the
wake
of
her
formidable
companion
my
attention
was
again
called
to
her
hands
which
she
held
clenched
at
her
sides
i
was
stepping
into
the
room
when
my
impulse
was
again
checked
another
person
was
sitting
there
a
person
i
had
been
most
anxious
to
see
ever
since
my
last
interview
with
sinclair
it
was
gilbertine
murray
sitting
alone
in
an
attitude
of
deep
and
possibly
not
altogether
happy
thought
i
paused
to
study
the
sweet
face
truly
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
i
had
never
before
realized
how
beautiful
her
rich
coloring
her
noble
traits
and
the
spirited
air
which
gave
her
such
marked
distinction
bespoke
at
once
an
ardent
nature
and
a
pure
soul
i
did
not
wonder
that
sinclair
had
succumbed
to
charms
so
pronounced
and
uncommon
and
as
i
gazed
longer
and
noted
the
tremulous
droop
of
her
ripe
lips
and
the
faraway
look
of
eyes
which
had
created
a
great
stir
in
the
social
world
when
they
first
flashed
upon
it
i
felt
that
if
sinclair
could
see
her
now
he
would
never
doubt
her
again
despite
the
fact
that
the
attitude
into
which
she
had
fallen
was
one
of
great
fatigue
if
not
despondency
she
held
a
fan
in
her
hand
and
as
i
stood
looking
at
her
she
dropped
it
as
she
stooped
to
pick
it
up
her
eyes
met
mine
and
a
startling
change
passed
over
her
springing
up
she
held
out
her
hands
in
wordless
appeal
then
let
them
drop
again
as
if
conscious
that
i
would
not
be
likely
to
understand
either
herself
or
her
mood
she
was
very
beautiful
entering
the
room
i
approached
her
had
sinclair
managed
to
have
his
little
conversation
with
her
something
must
have
happened
for
never
had
i
seen
her
in
such
a
state
of
suppressed
excitement
and
i
had
seen
her
many
times
both
here
and
in
her
aunt
house
when
i
was
visiting
dorothy
her
eyes
were
shining
not
with
a
brilliant
but
a
soft
light
and
the
smile
with
which
she
met
my
advance
had
something
in
it
strangely
tremulous
and
expectant
i
am
glad
to
have
a
moment
in
which
to
speak
to
you
alone
i
said
as
sinclair
oldest
and
closest
friend
i
wish
to
tell
you
how
truly
you
can
rely
both
on
his
affection
and
esteem
he
has
an
infinitely
good
heart
she
did
not
answer
as
brightly
and
as
quickly
as
i
expected
something
seemed
to
choke
her
something
which
she
finally
mastered
though
only
by
an
effort
which
left
her
pale
but
and
even
more
lovely
if
that
is
possible
than
before
thank
you
she
then
said
my
prospects
are
very
happy
no
one
but
myself
knows
how
happy
and
she
smiled
again
but
with
an
expression
which
recalled
to
my
mind
sinclair
fears
i
bowed
some
one
was
calling
her
name
evidently
our
interview
was
to
be
short
i
am
obliged
she
murmured
then
quickly
i
have
not
seen
the
moon
is
it
beautiful
can
you
see
it
from
this
veranda
but
before
i
could
answer
she
was
surrounded
and
dragged
off
by
a
knot
of
young
people
and
i
was
left
free
to
keep
my
engagement
with
sinclair
i
did
not
find
him
at
his
post
nor
could
any
one
tell
me
where
he
had
vanished
it
was
plain
that
his
conduct
was
looked
upon
as
strange
and
i
felt
some
anxiety
lest
it
should
appear
more
so
before
the
evening
was
over
i
found
him
at
last
in
his
room
sitting
with
his
head
buried
in
his
arms
he
started
up
as
i
entered
well
he
asked
sharply
i
have
learned
nothing
decisive
nor
i
i
exchanged
some
words
with
both
ladies
and
i
tackled
beaton
but
the
matter
remains
just
about
where
it
was
it
may
have
been
dorothy
who
took
the
box
and
it
may
have
been
gilbertine
but
there
seems
to
be
greater
reason
for
suspecting
dorothy
she
lives
a
hell
of
a
life
with
that
aunt
and
gilbertine
is
on
the
point
of
escaping
that
bondage
i
know
i
have
thought
of
that
walter
you
are
a
generous
fellow
and
for
a
moment
sinclair
looked
relieved
before
i
could
speak
however
he
was
sunk
again
in
his
old
despondency
but
the
doubt
he
cried
the
doubt
how
can
i
go
through
this
rehearsal
with
such
a
doubt
in
my
mind
i
can
not
and
will
not
go
tell
them
i
am
ill
and
can
not
come
down
again
god
knows
you
will
tell
no
untruth
i
saw
that
he
was
quite
beside
himself
but
ventured
upon
one
remonstrance
it
will
be
unwise
to
rouse
comment
i
said
if
that
box
was
taken
for
the
death
it
holds
the
one
restraint
most
likely
to
act
upon
the
young
girl
who
retains
it
will
be
the
conventionalities
of
her
position
and
the
requirements
of
the
hour
any
break
in
the
settled
order
of
things
anything
which
would
give
her
a
moment
by
herself
might
precipitate
the
dreadful
event
we
fear
remember
one
turn
of
the
hand
and
all
is
lost
a
drop
is
quickly
swallowed
frightful
he
murmured
the
perspiration
oozing
from
his
forehead
what
a
and
they
are
laughing
down
there
listen
to
them
i
even
imagine
i
hear
gilbertine
voice
is
there
unconsciousness
in
it
or
just
the
hilarity
of
a
distracted
mind
bent
on
i
can
not
tell
the
sound
conveys
no
meaning
to
me
she
has
a
sweet
true
face
i
said
and
she
wears
a
very
beautiful
smile
he
sprang
to
his
feet
yes
yes
a
smile
that
maddens
me
a
smile
that
tells
me
nothing
nothing
walter
walter
do
you
see
that
even
if
that
cursed
box
remains
unopened
and
nothing
ever
comes
of
its
theft
the
seeds
of
distrust
are
sown
thick
in
my
breast
and
i
must
always
ask
there
a
moment
when
my
young
bride
shrank
from
me
enough
to
dream
of
death
that
is
why
i
can
not
go
through
the
mockery
of
this
rehearsal
can
you
go
through
the
ceremony
of
marriage
i
must
if
nothing
happens
and
then
i
spoke
involuntarily
i
was
thinking
not
of
him
but
of
myself
but
he
evidently
found
in
my
words
an
echo
of
his
own
thought
yes
it
is
the
he
murmured
well
may
a
man
quail
before
that
he
did
go
down
stairs
however
and
later
on
went
through
the
rehearsal
very
much
as
i
had
expected
him
to
do
quietly
and
without
any
outward
show
of
emotion
as
soon
as
possible
after
this
the
company
separated
sinclair
making
me
an
imperceptible
gesture
as
he
went
up
stairs
i
knew
what
it
meant
and
was
in
his
room
as
soon
as
the
fellows
who
accompanied
him
had
left
him
alone
the
danger
is
from
now
on
he
cried
as
soon
as
i
had
closed
the
door
behind
me
i
shall
not
undress
nor
i
happily
we
both
have
rooms
by
ourselves
in
this
great
house
i
shall
put
out
my
light
and
then
open
my
door
as
far
as
need
be
not
a
move
in
the
house
will
escape
me
i
will
do
the
same
gilbertine
god
be
thanked
is
not
alone
in
her
room
little
miss
lane
shares
it
with
her
and
dorothy
oh
she
is
under
the
strictest
bondage
night
and
day
she
sleeps
in
a
little
room
off
her
aunt
do
you
know
her
door
i
shook
my
head
i
will
pass
down
the
hall
and
stop
an
instant
before
the
two
doors
we
are
most
interested
in
when
i
pass
gilbertine
i
will
throw
out
my
right
hand
i
stood
on
the
threshold
of
his
room
and
watched
him
when
the
two
doors
were
well
fixed
in
my
mind
i
went
to
my
own
room
and
prepared
for
my
watch
when
quite
ready
i
put
out
my
light
it
was
then
eleven
the
house
was
very
quiet
there
had
been
the
usual
bustle
attending
the
separation
of
a
party
of
laughing
chattering
girls
for
the
night
but
this
had
not
lasted
long
for
the
great
doings
of
the
morrow
called
for
bright
eyes
and
fresh
cheeks
and
these
can
only
be
gained
by
sleep
in
this
stillness
twelve
struck
and
the
first
hour
of
my
anxious
vigil
was
at
an
end
i
thought
of
sinclair
he
had
given
no
token
of
the
watch
he
was
keeping
but
i
knew
he
was
sitting
with
his
ear
to
the
door
listening
for
the
alarm
which
must
come
soon
if
it
came
at
all
but
would
it
come
at
all
were
we
not
wasting
strength
and
a
great
deal
of
emotion
on
a
dread
which
had
no
foundation
in
fact
what
were
we
two
sensible
and
as
a
rule
practical
men
thinking
of
that
we
should
ascribe
to
either
of
these
dainty
belles
of
a
conventional
and
shallow
society
the
wish
to
commit
a
deed
calling
for
the
vigor
and
daring
of
some
wilful
child
of
nature
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
in
this
sober
reasoning
hour
we
had
given
ourselves
over
to
a
ghastly
nightmare
and
would
yet
awake
why
was
i
on
my
feet
had
i
heard
anything
yes
a
stir
a
very
faint
stir
somewhere
down
the
hall
the
slow
cautious
opening
of
a
door
then
a
footfall
or
had
i
imagined
the
latter
i
could
hear
nothing
now
pushing
open
my
own
door
i
looked
cautiously
out
only
the
pale
face
of
sinclair
confronted
me
he
was
peering
from
the
corner
of
an
adjacent
passageway
the
moonlight
at
his
back
advancing
we
met
in
silence
for
the
moment
we
seemed
to
be
the
only
persons
awake
in
the
vast
house
i
thought
i
heard
a
step
was
my
cautious
whisper
after
a
moment
of
intense
listening
where
i
pointed
toward
that
portion
of
the
house
where
the
ladies
rooms
were
situated
that
is
not
what
i
heard
was
his
murmured
protest
what
i
heard
was
a
creak
in
the
small
stairway
running
down
at
the
end
of
the
hall
where
my
room
is
one
of
the
servants
i
ventured
and
for
a
moment
we
stood
irresolute
then
we
both
turned
rigid
as
some
sound
arose
in
one
of
the
rooms
only
to
quickly
relax
again
as
that
sound
resolved
itself
into
a
murmur
of
muffled
voices
where
there
was
talking
there
could
be
no
danger
of
the
special
event
we
feared
our
relief
was
so
great
we
both
smiled
next
instant
his
face
and
i
have
no
doubt
my
own
turned
the
color
of
clay
and
sinclair
went
reeling
back
against
the
wall
a
scream
had
risen
in
this
sleeping
house
a
piercing
and
insistent
scream
such
as
raises
the
hair
and
curdles
the
blood
iv
what
sinclair
had
to
show
me
this
scream
seemed
to
come
from
the
room
where
we
had
just
heard
voices
with
a
common
impulse
sinclair
and
i
both
started
down
the
hall
only
to
find
ourselves
met
by
a
dozen
wild
interrogations
from
behind
as
many
quickly
opened
doors
was
it
fire
had
burglars
got
in
what
was
the
matter
who
had
uttered
that
dreadful
shriek
alas
that
was
the
question
which
we
of
all
men
were
most
anxious
to
hear
answered
who
gilbertine
or
dorothy
gilbertine
door
was
reached
first
in
it
stood
a
short
slight
figure
wrapped
in
a
shawl
the
white
face
looked
into
ours
as
we
stopped
and
we
recognized
little
miss
lane
what
has
happened
she
gasped
it
must
have
been
an
awful
cry
to
waken
everybody
so
we
never
thought
of
answering
her
where
is
gilbertine
demanded
sinclair
thrusting
his
hand
out
as
if
to
put
her
aside
she
drew
herself
up
with
sudden
dignity
in
bed
she
replied
it
was
she
who
told
me
that
somebody
had
shrieked
i
did
wake
sinclair
uttered
a
sigh
of
the
greatest
relief
that
ever
burst
from
a
man
overcharged
breast
tell
her
we
will
find
out
what
it
means
he
replied
kindly
drawing
me
rapidly
away
by
this
time
and
armstrong
were
aroused
and
i
could
hear
the
slow
and
hesitating
tones
of
the
former
in
the
passage
behind
us
let
us
hasten
whispered
sinclair
our
eyes
must
be
the
first
to
see
what
lies
behind
that
door
i
shivered
the
door
he
had
designated
was
dorothy
sinclair
reached
it
first
and
pushed
it
open
pressing
up
behind
him
i
cast
a
fearful
look
over
his
shoulder
only
emptiness
confronted
us
dorothy
was
not
in
the
little
chamber
with
an
impulsive
gesture
sinclair
pointed
to
the
bed
it
had
not
been
lain
in
then
to
the
gas
it
was
still
burning
the
communicating
room
in
which
lansing
slept
was
also
lighted
but
silent
as
the
one
in
which
we
stood
this
last
struck
us
as
the
most
incomprehensible
fact
of
all
lansing
was
not
the
woman
to
sleep
through
a
disturbance
where
was
she
then
and
why
did
we
not
hear
her
strident
and
aggressive
tones
rising
in
angry
remonstrance
at
our
intrusion
had
she
followed
her
niece
from
the
room
should
we
in
another
minute
encounter
her
ponderous
figure
in
the
group
of
people
we
could
now
hear
hurrying
toward
us
i
was
for
retreating
and
hunting
the
house
over
for
dorothy
but
sinclair
with
truer
instinct
drew
me
across
the
threshold
of
this
silent
room
well
was
it
for
us
that
we
entered
there
together
for
i
do
not
know
how
either
of
us
weakened
as
we
were
by
our
forebodings
and
all
the
alarms
of
this
unprecedented
night
could
have
borne
alone
the
sight
that
awaited
us
on
the
bed
situated
at
the
right
of
the
doorway
lay
a
form
awful
ghastly
and
unspeakably
repulsive
the
head
which
lay
high
but
inert
upon
the
pillow
was
surrounded
with
the
gray
hairs
of
age
and
the
eyes
which
seemed
to
stare
into
ours
were
glassy
with
reflected
light
and
not
with
inward
intelligence
this
glassiness
told
the
tale
of
the
room
grim
silence
it
was
death
we
looked
on
not
the
death
we
had
anticipated
and
for
which
we
were
in
a
measure
prepared
but
one
fully
as
awful
and
having
for
its
victim
not
dorothy
camerden
nor
even
gilbertine
murray
but
the
heartless
aunt
who
had
driven
them
both
like
slaves
and
who
now
lay
facing
the
reward
of
her
earthly
deeds
as
a
realization
of
the
awful
truth
came
upon
me
i
stumbled
against
the
bedpost
looking
on
with
almost
blind
eyes
as
sinclair
bent
over
the
rapidly
whitening
face
whose
naturally
ruddy
color
no
one
had
ever
before
seen
disturbed
and
i
was
still
standing
there
when
armstrong
and
all
the
others
came
pouring
in
nor
have
i
any
distinct
remembrance
of
what
was
said
or
how
i
came
to
be
in
the
again
all
thought
all
consciousness
even
seemed
to
forsake
me
and
i
did
not
really
waken
to
my
surroundings
till
some
one
near
me
whispered
apoplexy
then
i
began
to
look
about
me
and
peer
into
the
faces
crowding
up
on
every
side
for
the
only
one
which
could
give
me
back
my
but
though
there
were
many
girlish
countenances
to
be
seen
in
the
awestruck
groups
huddled
in
every
corner
i
beheld
no
dorothy
and
was
therefore
but
little
astonished
when
in
another
moment
i
heard
the
cry
go
up
where
is
dorothy
where
was
she
when
her
aunt
died
alas
there
was
no
one
there
to
answer
and
the
looks
of
those
about
which
hitherto
had
expressed
little
save
awe
and
fright
turned
to
wonder
and
more
than
one
person
left
the
room
as
if
to
look
for
her
i
did
not
join
them
i
was
rooted
to
the
place
nor
did
sinclair
stir
a
foot
though
his
eye
which
had
been
wandering
restlessly
over
the
faces
about
him
now
settled
inquiringly
on
the
doorway
for
whom
was
he
looking
gilbertine
or
dorothy
gilbertine
no
doubt
for
he
visibly
brightened
as
her
figure
presently
appeared
clad
in
a
which
emphasized
her
height
and
gave
to
her
whole
appearance
a
womanly
sobriety
unusual
to
it
she
had
evidently
been
told
what
had
occurred
for
she
asked
no
questions
only
leaned
in
still
horror
against
the
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
room
within
sinclair
advancing
held
out
his
arm
she
gave
no
sign
of
seeing
it
then
he
spoke
this
seemed
to
rouse
her
for
she
gave
him
a
grateful
look
though
she
did
not
take
his
arm
there
will
be
no
wedding
fell
from
her
lips
in
murmur
only
a
few
minutes
had
passed
since
they
had
started
to
find
dorothy
but
it
seemed
an
age
to
me
my
body
remained
in
the
room
but
my
mind
was
searching
the
house
for
the
girl
i
loved
where
was
she
hidden
would
she
be
found
huddled
but
alive
in
some
chamber
or
was
another
and
more
dreadful
tragedy
awaiting
us
i
wondered
that
i
could
not
join
the
search
i
wondered
that
even
gilbertine
presence
could
keep
sinclair
from
doing
so
did
he
know
what
in
all
probability
this
missing
girl
had
with
her
did
he
know
what
i
had
suffered
was
suffering
ah
what
now
she
is
coming
i
can
hear
them
speaking
to
her
gilbertine
moves
from
the
door
and
a
young
man
and
woman
enter
with
dorothy
between
them
but
what
a
dorothy
years
could
have
made
no
greater
change
in
her
she
looked
and
she
moved
like
one
who
is
done
with
life
yet
fears
the
few
remaining
moments
left
her
instinctively
we
fell
back
before
her
instinctively
we
followed
her
with
our
eyes
as
reeling
a
little
at
the
door
she
cast
a
look
of
inconceivable
shrinking
first
at
her
own
bed
then
at
the
group
of
older
people
watching
her
with
serious
looks
from
the
room
beyond
as
she
did
so
i
noted
that
she
was
still
clad
in
her
evening
dress
of
gray
and
that
there
was
no
more
color
on
cheek
or
lip
than
in
the
neutral
tints
of
her
gown
was
it
our
consciousness
of
the
relief
which
lansing
death
horrible
as
it
was
must
bring
to
this
unhappy
girl
and
of
the
inappropriateness
of
any
display
of
grief
on
her
part
which
caused
the
silence
with
which
we
saw
her
pass
with
forced
step
and
dread
anticipation
into
the
room
where
that
image
of
dead
virulence
awaited
her
impossible
to
tell
i
could
not
read
my
own
thoughts
how
then
the
thoughts
of
others
but
thoughts
if
we
had
any
all
fled
when
after
one
slow
turn
of
her
head
toward
the
bed
this
trembling
young
girl
gave
a
choking
shriek
and
fell
face
down
on
the
floor
evidently
she
had
not
been
prepared
for
the
look
which
made
her
aunt
still
face
so
horrible
how
could
she
have
been
had
it
not
imprinted
itself
upon
my
mind
as
the
one
revolting
vision
of
my
life
how
then
if
this
young
and
girl
had
been
insensible
to
it
as
her
form
struck
the
floor
armstrong
rushed
forward
i
had
not
the
right
but
it
was
not
by
his
arms
she
was
lifted
sinclair
was
before
him
and
it
was
with
a
singularly
determined
look
i
could
not
understand
and
which
made
us
all
fall
back
that
he
raised
her
and
carried
her
in
to
her
own
bed
where
he
laid
her
gently
down
then
as
if
not
content
with
this
simple
attention
he
hovered
over
her
for
a
moment
arranging
the
pillows
and
smoothing
her
disheveled
hair
when
at
last
he
left
her
the
women
rushed
forward
not
too
many
of
you
was
his
final
adjuration
as
giving
me
a
look
he
slipped
out
into
the
hall
i
followed
him
immediately
he
had
gained
the
corridor
near
his
own
door
where
he
stood
awaiting
me
with
something
in
his
hand
as
i
approached
he
drew
me
to
the
window
and
showed
me
what
it
was
it
was
the
amethyst
box
open
and
empty
and
beside
it
shining
with
a
yellow
instead
of
a
purple
light
the
little
vial
void
of
the
one
drop
which
used
to
sparkle
within
it
i
found
the
vial
in
the
bed
with
the
old
woman
said
he
the
box
i
saw
glittering
among
dorothy
locks
before
she
fell
that
was
why
i
lifted
her
v
three
in
the
morning
as
he
spoke
youth
with
its
brilliant
hopes
illusions
and
beliefs
passed
from
me
never
to
return
in
the
same
measure
again
i
stared
at
the
glimmering
amethyst
i
stared
at
the
empty
vial
and
as
a
full
realization
of
all
his
words
implied
seized
my
benumbed
faculties
i
felt
the
icy
chill
of
some
grisly
horror
moving
among
the
roots
of
my
hair
lifting
it
on
my
forehead
and
filling
my
whole
being
with
shrinking
and
dismay
sinclair
with
a
quick
movement
replaced
the
tiny
flask
in
its
old
receptacle
and
then
thrusting
the
whole
out
of
sight
seized
my
hand
and
wrung
it
i
am
your
friend
he
whispered
remember
under
all
circumstances
and
in
every
exigency
your
friend
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
i
demanded
when
i
regained
control
of
my
speech
i
do
not
know
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
with
dorothy
he
drooped
his
head
i
could
see
his
fingers
working
in
the
moonlight
the
physicians
will
soon
be
here
i
heard
the
telephone
going
a
few
minutes
ago
when
they
have
pronounced
the
old
woman
dead
we
will
give
the
the
lady
you
mention
an
opportunity
to
explain
herself
explain
herself
she
simple
expectation
unconsciously
i
shook
my
head
it
is
the
least
we
can
do
he
gently
persisted
come
we
must
not
be
seen
with
our
heads
together
not
yet
i
am
sorry
that
we
two
were
found
more
or
less
dressed
at
the
time
of
the
alarm
it
may
cause
comment
she
was
dressed
too
i
murmured
as
much
to
myself
as
to
him
unfortunately
yes
was
the
muttered
reply
with
which
he
drew
off
and
hastened
into
the
hall
where
the
now
household
stood
in
a
great
group
about
the
excited
hostess
armstrong
was
not
the
woman
for
an
emergency
with
streaming
hair
and
kimono
she
was
gesticulating
wildly
and
bemoaning
the
break
in
the
festivities
which
this
event
must
necessarily
cause
as
sinclair
approached
she
turned
her
tirade
on
him
and
as
all
stood
still
to
listen
and
add
such
words
of
sympathy
or
disappointment
as
suggested
themselves
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
i
had
an
opportunity
to
note
that
neither
of
the
two
girls
most
interested
was
within
sight
this
troubled
me
drawing
up
to
the
outside
of
the
circle
i
asked
beaton
who
was
nearest
to
me
if
he
knew
how
miss
camerden
was
better
i
hear
poor
girl
it
was
a
great
shock
to
her
i
ventured
nothing
more
the
conventionality
of
his
tone
was
not
to
be
mistaken
our
conversation
on
the
veranda
was
to
be
ignored
i
did
not
know
whether
to
feel
relief
at
this
or
an
added
distress
i
was
in
a
whirl
of
emotion
which
robbed
me
of
all
discrimination
as
i
realized
my
own
condition
i
concluded
that
my
wisest
move
would
be
to
withdraw
myself
for
a
time
from
every
eye
accordingly
and
at
the
risk
of
offending
more
than
one
pretty
girl
who
still
had
something
to
say
concerning
this
terrible
mischance
i
slid
away
to
my
room
happy
to
escape
the
murmurs
and
snatches
of
talk
rising
on
every
side
one
bitter
speech
uttered
by
i
do
not
know
whom
rang
in
my
ears
and
made
all
thinking
unendurable
it
was
this
poor
woman
she
was
angry
once
too
often
i
heard
her
scolding
dorothy
again
after
she
went
to
her
room
that
is
why
dorothy
is
so
overcome
she
says
it
was
the
violence
of
her
aunt
rage
which
killed
her
a
rage
of
which
she
unfortunately
was
the
cause
so
there
were
words
again
between
these
two
after
the
door
closed
upon
them
for
the
night
was
this
what
we
heard
just
before
that
scream
went
up
it
would
seem
so
thereupon
quite
against
my
will
i
found
myself
thinking
of
dorothy
changed
position
before
the
world
only
yesterday
a
dependent
slave
the
owner
of
millions
gilbertine
would
have
her
share
a
large
one
but
there
was
enough
to
make
them
both
wealthy
intolerable
thought
would
that
no
money
had
been
involved
i
hated
to
think
of
those
diamonds
and
oh
anything
was
better
than
this
dashing
from
my
room
i
joined
one
of
the
groups
into
which
the
single
large
circle
had
now
broken
up
the
house
had
been
lighted
from
end
to
end
and
some
effort
had
been
made
at
a
more
respectable
appearance
by
such
persons
as
i
now
saw
some
even
were
fully
dressed
all
were
engaged
in
discussing
the
one
great
topic
listening
and
not
listening
i
waited
for
the
front
door
bell
to
ring
it
sounded
while
one
woman
was
saying
to
another
the
sinclairs
will
now
be
able
to
take
their
honeymoon
on
their
own
yacht
i
made
my
way
to
where
i
could
watch
sinclair
while
the
physicians
were
in
the
room
i
thought
his
face
looked
very
noble
the
narrowness
of
his
own
escape
the
sympathy
for
me
which
the
event
so
much
worse
than
either
of
us
anticipated
had
awakened
in
his
generous
breast
had
called
out
all
that
was
best
in
his
naturally
reserved
and
nature
a
tower
of
strength
he
was
to
me
that
hour
i
knew
that
mercy
and
mercy
only
would
influence
his
conduct
he
would
be
guilty
of
no
rash
or
inconsiderate
act
he
would
give
this
young
girl
a
chance
therefore
when
the
physicians
had
pronounced
the
case
one
of
apoplexy
a
conclusion
most
natural
under
the
circumstances
and
the
excitement
which
had
held
together
the
various
groups
of
uneasy
guests
had
begun
to
subside
it
was
with
perfect
confidence
i
saw
him
approach
and
address
gilbertine
she
was
standing
fully
dressed
at
the
stairhead
where
she
had
stopped
to
hold
some
conversation
with
the
retiring
physicians
and
the
look
she
gave
him
in
return
and
the
way
she
moved
off
in
obedience
to
his
command
or
suggestion
assured
me
that
he
was
laying
plans
for
an
interview
with
dorothy
consequently
i
was
quite
ready
to
obey
him
when
he
finally
stepped
up
to
me
and
said
go
below
and
if
you
find
the
library
empty
as
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
light
one
and
see
that
the
door
to
the
conservatory
is
unlocked
i
require
a
place
in
which
to
make
gilbertine
comfortable
while
i
have
some
words
with
her
cousin
but
how
will
you
be
able
to
influence
miss
camerden
to
come
down
somehow
the
familiar
name
of
dorothy
would
not
pass
my
lips
do
you
think
she
will
recognize
your
right
to
summon
her
to
an
interview
yes
i
had
never
seen
his
lip
take
that
firm
line
before
yet
i
had
always
known
him
to
be
a
man
of
great
resolution
but
how
can
you
reach
her
she
is
shut
up
in
her
own
room
under
the
care
i
am
told
of
armstrong
maid
i
know
but
she
will
escape
that
dreadful
place
as
soon
as
her
feet
will
carry
her
i
shall
wait
in
the
hall
till
she
is
seen
to
enter
it
then
i
will
say
and
she
will
come
attended
by
gilbertine
and
i
do
you
mean
me
to
be
present
at
an
interview
so
painful
nay
so
serious
and
so
threatening
it
would
cut
short
every
word
you
hope
to
hear
i
can
not
i
have
not
asked
you
to
it
is
imperative
that
i
should
see
miss
camerden
alone
he
could
not
call
her
dorothy
either
i
shall
ask
gilbertine
to
accompany
us
so
that
appearances
may
be
preserved
i
want
you
to
be
able
to
inform
any
one
who
approaches
the
door
that
you
saw
me
go
in
there
with
miss
murray
then
i
am
to
stay
in
the
hall
if
you
will
be
so
kind
the
clock
struck
three
it
is
very
late
i
exclaimed
why
not
wait
till
morning
and
have
the
whole
house
about
our
ears
no
besides
some
things
will
not
keep
an
hour
a
moment
i
must
hear
what
this
young
girl
has
to
say
in
response
to
my
questions
remember
i
am
the
owner
of
the
flask
whose
contents
killed
the
old
woman
you
believe
she
died
from
swallowing
that
drop
absolutely
i
said
no
more
but
hastened
down
stairs
to
do
his
bidding
i
found
the
lower
hall
partly
lighted
but
none
of
the
rooms
entering
the
library
i
lit
the
gas
as
sinclair
had
requested
then
i
tried
the
conservatory
door
it
was
unlocked
casting
a
sharp
glance
around
i
made
sure
that
the
lounges
were
all
unoccupied
and
that
i
could
safely
leave
sinclair
to
hold
his
contemplated
interview
without
fear
of
interruption
then
dreading
a
premature
arrival
on
his
part
i
slid
quickly
out
and
moved
down
the
hall
to
where
the
light
of
the
one
burning
jet
failed
to
penetrate
i
will
watch
from
here
thought
i
and
entered
upon
the
quick
pacing
of
the
floor
which
my
impatience
and
the
overwrought
condition
of
my
nerves
demanded
but
before
i
had
turned
on
my
steps
more
than
half
a
dozen
times
the
single
but
brilliant
ray
coming
from
some
door
in
the
rear
caught
my
eye
and
i
had
the
curiosity
to
step
back
and
see
if
any
one
was
sharing
my
watch
in
doing
so
i
came
upon
the
little
spiral
staircase
which
earlier
in
the
evening
sinclair
had
heard
creak
under
some
unknown
footstep
had
this
footstep
been
dorothy
and
if
so
what
had
brought
her
into
this
remote
portion
of
the
house
fear
anguish
remorse
a
flying
from
herself
or
from
i
wished
i
knew
just
where
she
had
been
found
by
the
two
young
persons
who
had
brought
her
back
into
her
aunt
room
no
one
had
volunteered
the
information
and
i
had
not
seen
the
moment
when
i
felt
myself
in
a
position
to
demand
it
proceeding
further
i
stood
amazed
at
my
own
forgetfulness
the
light
which
had
attracted
my
attention
came
from
the
room
devoted
to
the
display
of
miss
murray
this
i
should
have
known
instantly
having
had
a
hand
in
their
arrangement
but
all
my
faculties
were
dulled
that
night
save
such
as
responded
to
dread
and
horror
before
going
back
i
paused
to
look
at
the
detective
whose
business
it
was
to
guard
the
room
he
was
sitting
very
quietly
at
his
post
and
if
he
saw
me
he
did
not
look
up
strange
that
i
had
forgotten
this
man
when
keeping
my
own
vigil
above
i
doubted
if
sinclair
had
remembered
him
either
yet
he
must
have
been
unconsciously
sharing
our
watch
from
start
to
finish
must
even
have
heard
the
cry
as
only
a
waking
man
could
hear
it
should
i
ask
him
if
this
was
so
no
perhaps
i
had
not
the
courage
to
hear
his
answer
shortly
after
my
return
into
the
main
hall
i
heard
steps
on
the
grand
staircase
looking
up
i
saw
the
two
girls
descending
followed
by
sinclair
he
had
been
successful
then
in
inducing
dorothy
to
come
down
what
would
be
the
result
could
i
stand
the
suspense
of
the
impending
interview
as
they
stepped
within
the
rays
of
the
solitary
already
mentioned
i
cast
one
quick
look
into
gilbertine
face
then
a
long
one
into
dorothy
i
could
read
neither
if
it
was
horror
and
horror
only
which
rendered
both
so
pale
and
fixed
of
feature
then
their
emotion
was
similar
in
character
and
intensity
but
if
in
either
breast
the
one
dominant
sentiment
was
fear
horrible
fear
then
was
that
fear
confined
to
dorothy
for
while
gilbertine
advanced
bravely
dorothy
steps
lagged
and
at
the
point
where
she
should
have
turned
into
the
library
she
whirled
sharply
about
and
made
as
if
she
would
fly
back
up
stairs
but
one
stare
from
gilbertine
one
word
from
sinclair
recalled
her
to
herself
and
she
passed
in
and
the
door
closed
upon
the
three
i
was
left
to
prevent
possible
intrusion
and
to
eat
out
my
heart
in
intolerable
suspense
vi
dorothy
speaks
i
shall
not
subject
you
to
the
ordeal
from
which
i
suffered
you
shall
follow
my
three
friends
into
the
room
according
to
description
the
interview
proceeded
thus
as
soon
as
the
door
had
closed
upon
them
and
before
either
of
the
girls
had
a
chance
to
speak
he
remarked
to
gilbertine
i
have
brought
you
here
because
i
wish
to
express
to
you
in
the
presence
of
your
cousin
my
sympathy
for
the
bereavement
which
in
an
instant
has
robbed
you
both
of
a
lifelong
guardian
i
also
wish
to
say
in
the
light
of
this
sad
event
that
i
am
ready
if
propriety
so
exacts
to
postpone
the
ceremony
which
i
hoped
would
unite
our
lives
your
wish
shall
be
my
wish
gilbertine
though
i
would
suggest
that
possibly
you
never
more
needed
the
sympathy
and
protection
which
only
a
husband
can
give
than
you
do
he
told
me
afterward
that
he
was
so
taken
up
with
the
effect
of
this
suggestion
on
gilbertine
that
he
forgot
to
look
at
dorothy
though
the
hint
he
strove
to
convey
of
impending
trouble
was
meant
as
much
for
her
as
for
his
affianced
bride
in
another
moment
he
regretted
this
especially
when
he
saw
that
dorothy
had
changed
her
attitude
and
was
now
looking
away
from
them
both
what
do
you
say
gilbertine
he
asked
earnestly
as
she
sat
flushing
and
paling
before
him
nothing
i
have
not
thought
it
is
a
question
for
others
to
decide
others
who
know
what
is
right
better
than
i
appreciate
your
consideration
she
suddenly
burst
out
and
should
be
glad
to
tell
you
at
this
moment
what
to
expect
but
give
me
a
little
time
let
me
see
you
later
in
the
morning
sinclair
after
we
are
all
somewhat
rested
and
when
i
can
see
you
quite
alone
dorothy
rose
shall
i
go
she
asked
sinclair
advanced
and
with
quiet
protest
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
quietly
she
sank
back
into
her
seat
i
want
to
say
a
words
to
you
miss
camerden
gilbertine
will
pardon
us
it
is
about
matters
which
must
be
settled
there
are
decisions
to
arrive
at
and
arrangements
to
be
made
armstrong
has
instructed
me
to
question
you
in
regard
to
these
as
the
one
best
acquainted
with
lansing
affairs
and
general
tastes
we
will
not
trouble
gilbertine
she
has
her
own
decisions
to
reach
dear
will
you
let
me
make
you
comfortable
in
the
conservatory
while
i
talk
for
five
minutes
with
dorothy
he
said
she
met
this
question
with
a
look
so
blank
and
uncomprehending
that
he
just
lifted
her
and
carried
her
in
among
the
palms
i
must
speak
to
dorothy
he
pleaded
placing
her
in
the
chair
where
he
had
often
seen
her
sit
of
her
own
accord
be
a
good
girl
i
will
not
keep
you
here
long
but
why
can
not
i
go
to
my
room
i
do
not
understand
i
am
frightened
what
have
you
to
say
to
dorothy
you
can
not
say
to
me
she
seemed
so
excited
that
for
a
minute
just
a
minute
he
faltered
in
his
purpose
then
he
took
her
gravely
by
the
hand
i
have
told
you
said
he
then
he
kissed
her
softly
on
the
forehead
be
quiet
dear
and
rest
see
here
are
roses
he
plucked
and
flung
a
handful
into
her
lap
then
he
crossed
back
to
the
library
and
shut
the
conservatory
door
behind
him
i
am
not
surprised
that
gilbertine
wondered
at
her
peremptory
bridegroom
when
sinclair
reëntered
the
library
he
found
dorothy
standing
with
her
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
door
leading
into
the
hall
her
head
was
bent
and
thoughtful
as
though
she
were
inwardly
debating
whether
to
stand
her
ground
or
fly
sinclair
gave
her
no
further
opportunity
for
hesitation
advancing
rapidly
he
laid
his
hand
quietly
on
hers
and
with
a
gravity
which
must
have
impressed
her
quietly
remarked
i
must
ask
you
to
stay
and
hear
what
i
have
to
say
i
wished
to
spare
gilbertine
would
that
i
could
spare
you
but
circumstances
forbid
you
know
and
i
know
that
your
aunt
did
not
die
of
apoplexy
she
gave
a
violent
start
and
her
lips
parted
if
the
hand
under
his
clasp
had
been
cold
it
was
now
icy
he
let
his
own
slip
from
the
contact
you
know
she
echoed
trembling
and
pallid
her
released
hand
flying
instinctively
to
her
hair
yes
you
need
not
feel
about
for
the
little
box
i
took
it
from
its
when
i
laid
you
fainting
on
the
bed
here
it
is
he
drew
it
from
his
pocket
and
showed
it
to
her
she
hardly
glanced
at
it
her
eyes
were
fixed
in
terror
on
his
face
and
her
lips
seemed
to
be
trying
in
vain
to
formulate
some
inquiry
he
tried
to
be
merciful
i
missed
it
many
hours
ago
from
the
shelf
yonder
where
you
all
saw
me
place
it
had
i
known
that
you
had
taken
it
i
would
have
repeated
to
you
how
deadly
were
the
contents
and
how
dangerous
it
was
to
handle
the
vial
or
to
let
others
handle
it
much
less
to
put
it
to
the
lips
she
started
and
instinctively
her
form
rose
to
its
full
height
have
you
looked
in
that
little
box
since
you
took
it
from
my
hair
she
asked
yes
then
you
know
it
to
be
empty
for
answer
he
pressed
the
spring
and
the
little
lid
flew
open
it
is
not
empty
now
you
see
then
more
slowly
and
with
infinite
meaning
but
the
little
flask
is
she
brought
her
hands
together
and
faced
him
with
a
noble
dignity
which
at
once
put
the
interview
on
a
different
footing
where
was
this
vial
found
she
demanded
he
found
it
difficult
to
answer
they
seemed
to
have
exchanged
positions
when
he
did
speak
it
was
in
a
low
tone
and
with
less
confidence
than
he
had
shown
before
in
the
bed
with
the
old
lady
i
saw
it
there
myself
worthington
was
with
me
nobody
else
knows
anything
about
it
i
wished
to
give
you
an
opportunity
to
explain
i
begin
to
think
you
can
but
how
god
only
knows
the
box
was
hidden
in
your
hair
from
early
evening
i
saw
your
hand
continually
fluttering
toward
it
all
the
time
we
were
dancing
in
the
parlor
she
did
not
lose
an
iota
of
her
dignity
or
pride
you
are
right
she
said
i
put
it
there
as
soon
as
i
took
it
from
the
cabinet
i
could
think
of
no
safer
yes
i
took
it
she
acknowledged
as
she
saw
the
flush
rise
to
his
cheek
i
took
it
but
with
no
worse
motive
than
the
dishonest
one
of
having
for
my
own
an
object
which
bewitched
me
i
was
hardly
myself
when
i
snatched
it
from
the
shelf
and
thrust
it
into
my
hair
he
stared
at
her
in
amazement
her
confession
and
her
attitude
so
completely
contradicted
each
other
but
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
vial
she
went
on
and
with
this
declaration
her
whole
manner
even
her
voice
changed
as
if
with
the
utterance
of
these
few
words
she
had
satisfied
some
inner
demand
of
and
could
now
enter
into
the
sufferings
of
those
about
her
this
i
think
it
right
to
make
plain
to
you
i
supposed
the
vial
to
be
in
the
box
when
i
took
it
but
when
i
got
to
my
room
and
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
deadly
trinket
i
found
it
empty
just
as
you
found
it
when
you
took
it
from
my
hair
some
one
had
taken
the
vial
out
before
my
hand
had
ever
touched
the
box
like
a
man
who
feels
himself
suddenly
seized
by
the
throat
yet
who
struggles
for
the
life
slowly
but
inexorably
leaving
him
sinclair
cast
one
heartrending
look
toward
the
conservatory
then
heavily
demanded
why
were
you
out
of
your
room
why
did
they
have
to
look
for
you
who
was
the
person
who
uttered
that
scream
she
confronted
him
sadly
but
with
an
earnestness
he
could
not
but
respect
i
was
not
in
the
room
because
i
was
troubled
by
my
discovery
i
think
i
had
some
idea
of
returning
the
box
to
the
shelf
from
which
i
had
taken
it
at
all
events
i
found
myself
on
the
little
staircase
in
the
rear
when
that
cry
rang
through
the
house
i
do
not
know
who
uttered
it
i
only
know
that
it
did
not
spring
from
my
lips
in
a
rush
of
renewed
hope
he
seized
her
by
the
hand
it
was
your
aunt
he
whispered
it
was
she
who
took
the
vial
out
of
the
box
who
put
it
to
her
own
lips
who
shrieked
when
she
felt
her
vitals
gripped
had
you
stayed
you
would
have
known
this
ca
you
say
so
do
you
think
so
why
do
you
look
at
me
with
those
incredulous
eyes
because
you
must
not
believe
a
lie
because
you
are
too
good
a
man
to
be
sacrificed
it
was
a
younger
throat
than
my
aunt
which
gave
utterance
to
that
shriek
sinclair
be
advised
not
be
married
meanwhile
i
was
pacing
the
hall
without
in
a
delirium
of
suspense
i
tried
hard
to
keep
within
the
bounds
of
silence
i
had
turned
for
the
fiftieth
time
to
face
that
library
door
when
suddenly
i
heard
a
hoarse
cry
break
from
within
and
saw
the
door
fly
open
and
dorothy
come
hurrying
out
she
shrank
when
she
saw
me
but
seemed
grateful
that
i
did
not
attempt
to
stop
her
and
soon
was
up
the
stairs
and
out
of
sight
i
rushed
at
once
into
the
library
i
found
sinclair
sitting
before
a
table
with
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
in
an
instant
i
knew
that
our
positions
were
again
reversed
and
without
stopping
to
give
heed
to
my
own
sensations
i
approached
him
as
near
as
i
dared
and
laid
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
shuddered
but
did
not
look
up
and
it
was
minutes
before
he
spoke
then
it
all
came
in
a
rush
fool
fool
that
i
was
and
i
saw
that
she
was
consumed
by
fright
the
moment
it
became
plain
that
i
was
intent
upon
having
some
conversation
with
dorothy
her
fingers
where
they
gripped
my
arm
must
have
left
marks
behind
them
but
i
saw
only
womanly
nervousness
where
a
man
less
blind
would
have
detected
guilt
walter
i
wish
that
the
mere
scent
of
this
empty
flask
would
kill
then
i
should
not
have
to
reënter
that
conservatory
door
or
look
again
in
her
face
or
he
had
taken
out
the
cursed
jewel
and
was
fingering
it
in
a
nervous
way
which
went
to
my
heart
of
hearts
gently
removing
it
from
his
hand
i
asked
with
all
the
calmness
possible
what
is
all
this
mystery
why
have
your
suspicions
returned
to
gilbertine
i
thought
you
had
entirely
dissociated
her
with
this
matter
and
that
you
blamed
dorothy
and
dorothy
only
for
the
amethyst
loss
dorothy
had
the
empty
box
but
the
vial
the
vial
that
had
been
taken
by
a
previous
hand
do
you
remember
the
white
silk
train
which
armstrong
saw
slipping
from
this
room
i
can
not
talk
walter
my
duty
leads
me
he
pointed
toward
the
conservatory
i
drew
back
and
asked
if
i
should
take
up
my
watch
again
outside
the
door
he
shook
his
head
it
makes
no
difference
nothing
makes
any
difference
but
if
you
want
to
please
me
stay
here
i
at
once
sank
into
a
chair
he
made
a
great
effort
and
advanced
to
the
conservatory
door
i
studiously
looked
another
way
my
heart
was
breaking
with
sympathy
for
him
but
in
another
instant
i
was
on
my
feet
i
could
hear
him
rushing
about
among
the
palms
presently
i
heard
his
voice
shout
out
the
wild
cry
she
is
gone
i
forgot
there
was
another
door
communicating
with
the
hall
i
crossed
the
floor
and
entered
where
he
stood
gazing
down
at
an
empty
seat
and
a
trail
of
scattered
roses
never
shall
i
forget
his
face
the
dimness
of
the
spot
could
not
hide
his
deep
unspeakable
emotions
to
him
this
flight
bore
but
one
interpretation
guilt
i
did
not
advocate
sinclair
pressing
the
matter
further
that
night
i
saw
that
he
was
exhausted
and
that
any
further
movement
would
tax
him
beyond
his
strength
we
therefore
separated
immediately
after
leaving
the
library
and
i
found
my
way
to
my
own
room
alone
it
may
seem
callous
in
me
but
i
fell
asleep
very
soon
after
and
did
not
wake
till
roused
by
a
knock
at
my
door
on
opening
it
i
confronted
sinclair
looking
haggard
and
unkempt
as
he
entered
the
first
clear
notes
of
the
could
be
heard
rising
up
from
the
lower
hall
i
have
not
slept
he
said
i
have
been
walking
the
hall
all
night
listening
by
spells
at
her
door
and
at
other
times
giving
what
counsel
i
could
to
the
armstrongs
god
forgive
me
but
i
have
said
nothing
to
any
one
of
what
has
made
this
affair
an
awful
tragedy
to
me
do
you
think
i
did
wrong
i
waited
to
give
dorothy
a
chance
why
should
i
not
show
the
same
consideration
to
gilbertine
you
should
but
our
eyes
did
not
meet
and
neither
voice
expressed
the
least
hope
i
shall
not
go
to
breakfast
he
now
declared
i
have
written
this
line
to
gilbertine
will
you
see
that
she
gets
it
for
reply
i
held
out
my
hand
he
placed
the
note
in
it
and
i
was
touched
to
see
that
it
was
unsealed
be
sure
when
you
give
it
to
her
that
she
will
have
an
opportunity
of
reading
it
alone
i
shall
request
the
use
of
one
of
the
little
this
morning
let
her
come
there
if
she
is
so
impelled
she
will
find
a
friend
as
well
as
a
judge
i
endeavored
to
express
sympathy
urge
patience
and
suggest
hope
but
he
had
no
ear
for
words
though
he
tried
to
listen
poor
fellow
so
i
soon
stopped
and
he
presently
left
the
room
i
immediately
made
myself
as
presentable
as
a
night
of
unprecedented
emotions
would
allow
and
went
below
to
do
him
such
service
as
opportunity
offered
and
the
exigencies
of
the
case
permitted
i
found
the
lower
hall
alive
with
eager
guests
and
a
few
outsiders
news
of
the
sad
event
was
slowly
making
its
way
through
the
avenue
and
some
of
the
armstrongs
nearest
neighbors
had
left
their
to
express
their
interest
and
to
hear
the
particulars
among
these
stood
the
lady
of
the
house
but
armstrong
was
nowhere
within
sight
for
him
the
breakfast
waited
not
wishing
to
be
caught
in
any
little
swirl
of
conventional
comment
i
remained
near
the
staircase
waiting
for
some
one
to
descend
who
could
give
me
news
concerning
miss
murray
for
i
had
small
expectation
of
her
braving
the
eyes
of
these
strangers
and
doubted
if
even
dorothy
would
be
seen
at
the
but
little
miss
lane
if
small
was
gifted
with
a
great
appetite
she
would
be
sure
to
appear
prior
to
the
last
summons
and
as
we
were
good
friends
she
would
listen
to
my
questions
and
give
me
the
answer
i
needed
for
the
carrying
out
of
sinclair
wishes
but
before
her
light
footfall
was
heard
descending
i
was
lured
from
my
plans
by
an
unexpected
series
of
events
three
men
came
down
one
after
the
other
followed
by
armstrong
looking
even
more
grave
and
ponderous
than
usual
two
of
them
were
the
physicians
who
had
been
called
in
the
night
and
whom
i
had
myself
seen
depart
somewhere
near
three
the
third
i
did
not
know
but
he
looked
like
a
doctor
also
why
were
they
here
again
so
early
had
anything
new
come
to
light
it
was
a
question
which
seemed
to
strike
others
as
well
as
myself
as
armstrong
ushered
them
down
the
hall
and
out
of
the
front
door
many
were
the
curious
glances
which
followed
them
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
courteous
host
on
his
return
escaped
the
questions
and
detaining
hands
of
some
of
his
more
inquisitive
guests
a
pleasant
word
an
amiable
smile
he
had
for
all
but
i
was
quite
certain
when
i
saw
him
disappear
into
the
little
room
he
retained
for
his
own
use
that
he
had
told
them
nothing
which
could
in
any
way
relieve
their
curiosity
this
filled
me
with
a
vague
alarm
something
must
have
occurred
something
which
sinclair
ought
to
know
i
felt
a
great
anxiety
and
was
closely
watching
the
door
behind
which
armstrong
had
vanished
when
it
suddenly
opened
and
i
perceived
that
he
had
been
writing
a
telegram
as
he
gave
it
to
one
of
the
servants
he
made
a
gesture
to
the
man
standing
with
extended
hand
by
the
chinese
gong
and
the
summons
rang
out
for
breakfast
instantly
the
hum
of
voices
ceased
and
young
and
old
turned
toward
the
but
the
host
did
not
enter
with
them
before
the
younger
and
more
active
of
his
guests
could
reach
his
side
he
had
slid
into
the
room
which
i
have
before
described
as
set
apart
for
the
display
of
gilbertine
instantly
i
lost
all
inclination
for
breakfast
and
lingered
about
in
the
hall
until
every
one
had
passed
me
even
little
miss
lane
who
had
come
down
unperceived
while
i
was
watching
armstrong
door
not
very
well
pleased
with
myself
for
having
missed
the
one
opportunity
which
might
have
been
of
service
to
me
i
was
asking
myself
whether
i
should
follow
her
and
make
the
best
attempt
i
could
at
sociability
if
not
at
eating
when
armstrong
approached
from
the
side
hall
and
accosting
me
inquired
if
sinclair
had
come
down
yet
i
assured
him
that
i
had
not
seen
him
and
did
not
think
he
meant
to
come
to
breakfast
adding
that
he
had
been
very
much
affected
by
the
affairs
of
the
night
and
had
told
me
that
he
was
going
to
shut
himself
up
in
his
room
and
rest
i
am
sorry
but
there
is
a
question
i
must
ask
him
immediately
it
is
about
a
little
italian
trinket
which
i
am
told
he
displayed
to
the
ladies
yesterday
afternoon
vii
constraint
so
our
dreadful
secret
was
not
confined
to
ourselves
as
we
had
supposed
but
was
shared
or
at
least
suspected
by
our
host
thankful
that
it
was
i
rather
than
sinclair
who
was
called
upon
to
meet
and
sustain
this
shock
i
answered
with
what
calmness
i
could
yes
sinclair
mentioned
the
matter
to
me
indeed
if
you
have
any
curiosity
on
the
subject
i
think
i
can
enlighten
you
as
fully
as
he
can
armstrong
glanced
up
the
stairs
hesitated
then
drew
me
into
his
private
room
i
find
myself
in
a
very
uncomfortable
position
he
began
a
strange
and
quite
unaccountable
change
has
shown
itself
in
the
appearance
of
lansing
body
during
the
last
few
hours
a
change
which
baffles
the
physicians
and
raises
in
their
minds
very
unfortunate
conjectures
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
sinclair
still
has
in
his
possession
the
box
which
is
said
to
hold
a
vial
of
deadly
poison
or
whether
it
has
passed
into
any
other
hand
since
he
showed
it
to
certain
ladies
in
the
library
we
were
standing
directly
in
the
light
of
an
eastern
window
deception
was
impossible
even
if
i
had
felt
like
employing
it
in
interests
if
not
in
my
own
i
resolved
to
be
as
true
to
our
host
as
our
positions
demanded
yet
at
the
same
time
to
save
gilbertine
as
much
as
possible
from
premature
if
not
final
suspicion
i
therefore
replied
that
is
a
question
i
can
answer
as
well
as
sinclair
happy
was
i
to
save
him
this
while
he
was
showing
this
toy
armstrong
came
into
the
room
and
proposed
a
stroll
which
drew
all
of
the
ladies
from
the
room
and
called
for
his
attendance
as
well
with
no
thought
of
the
danger
involved
he
placed
the
trinket
on
a
high
shelf
in
the
cabinet
and
went
out
with
the
rest
when
he
came
back
for
it
it
was
gone
the
usually
ruddy
aspect
of
my
host
face
deepened
and
he
sat
down
in
the
great
armchair
which
did
duty
before
his
this
is
dreadful
was
his
comment
entailing
i
do
not
know
what
unfortunate
consequences
upon
this
household
and
on
the
unhappy
girl
girl
i
repeated
he
turned
upon
me
with
great
gravity
worthington
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
admit
it
but
something
strange
something
not
easily
explainable
took
place
in
this
house
last
night
it
has
only
just
come
to
light
otherwise
the
doctors
conclusions
might
have
been
different
you
know
there
is
a
detective
in
the
house
the
presents
are
valuable
and
i
thought
best
to
have
a
man
here
to
look
after
them
i
nodded
i
had
no
breath
for
speech
that
man
tells
me
continued
armstrong
that
just
a
few
minutes
previous
to
the
time
the
whole
household
was
aroused
last
night
he
heard
a
step
in
the
hall
overhead
then
the
sound
of
a
light
foot
descending
the
little
staircase
in
the
servants
hall
being
anxious
to
find
out
what
this
person
wanted
at
an
hour
so
late
he
lowered
the
gas
closed
his
door
and
listened
the
steps
went
by
his
door
satisfied
that
it
was
a
woman
he
heard
he
pulled
open
the
door
again
and
looked
out
a
young
girl
was
standing
not
very
far
from
him
in
a
thin
streak
of
moonlight
she
was
gazing
intently
at
something
in
her
hand
and
that
something
had
a
purple
gleam
to
it
he
is
ready
to
swear
to
this
next
moment
frightened
by
some
noise
she
heard
she
fled
back
and
vanished
again
in
the
region
of
the
little
staircase
it
was
soon
very
soon
after
this
that
the
shriek
came
now
worthington
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
knowledge
i
have
advised
this
man
to
hold
his
peace
till
i
can
make
inquiries
but
where
am
i
to
make
them
i
can
not
think
that
miss
camerden
the
ejaculation
which
escaped
me
was
involuntary
to
hear
her
name
for
the
second
time
in
this
association
was
more
than
i
could
bear
did
he
say
it
was
miss
camerden
i
hurriedly
inquired
as
he
looked
at
me
in
some
surprise
how
should
he
know
miss
camerden
he
described
her
was
the
unanswerable
reply
besides
we
know
that
she
was
circulating
in
the
halls
at
that
time
i
declare
i
have
never
known
a
worse
business
this
amiable
man
bemoaned
let
me
send
for
sinclair
he
is
more
interested
than
any
one
else
in
relatives
or
stay
what
if
i
should
send
for
miss
camerden
herself
she
should
be
able
to
tell
how
she
came
by
this
box
i
subdued
my
own
instincts
which
were
all
for
clearing
dorothy
on
the
spot
and
answered
as
i
thought
sinclair
would
like
me
to
answer
it
is
a
serious
and
very
perplexing
piece
of
business
said
i
but
if
you
will
wait
a
short
time
i
do
not
think
you
will
have
to
trouble
miss
camerden
i
am
sure
that
explanations
will
be
given
give
the
lady
a
chance
i
stammered
imagine
what
her
feelings
would
be
if
questioned
on
so
delicate
a
topic
it
would
make
a
breach
which
nothing
could
heal
later
if
she
does
not
speak
it
will
be
only
right
for
you
to
ask
her
why
she
did
not
come
down
this
morning
naturally
not
if
i
could
take
counsel
of
my
wife
but
she
is
of
too
nervous
a
temperament
i
am
anxious
to
keep
her
from
knowing
this
fresh
complication
as
long
as
possible
do
you
think
i
can
look
for
miss
camerden
to
explain
herself
before
the
doctors
return
or
before
lansing
physician
for
whom
i
have
telegraphed
can
arrive
from
new
york
i
am
sure
that
three
hours
will
not
pass
before
you
hear
the
truth
leave
me
to
work
out
the
situation
i
promise
that
if
i
can
not
bring
it
about
to
your
satisfaction
sinclair
shall
be
asked
to
lend
his
assistance
only
keep
the
gossips
from
miss
camerden
good
name
words
can
be
said
in
a
moment
that
will
not
be
forgotten
in
years
i
tremble
at
such
a
prospect
for
her
no
one
knows
of
her
being
seen
with
the
box
he
remarked
every
one
probably
knows
by
this
time
that
there
is
some
doubt
felt
as
to
the
cause
of
lansing
death
you
can
not
keep
a
suspicion
of
this
nature
secret
in
a
house
so
full
of
people
as
this
i
knew
it
but
relieved
by
his
manner
if
not
by
his
words
i
took
my
leave
of
him
for
the
present
and
made
my
way
at
once
to
the
should
i
find
miss
lane
there
yes
and
what
was
more
the
fortunes
of
the
day
had
decreed
that
the
place
beside
her
should
be
unoccupied
i
was
on
my
way
to
that
place
when
i
was
struck
by
the
extreme
quiet
into
which
the
room
had
fallen
it
had
been
humming
with
talk
when
i
first
entered
but
now
not
a
voice
was
raised
and
scarcely
an
eye
in
the
hurried
glance
i
cast
about
the
board
not
a
look
met
mine
in
recognition
or
welcome
what
did
it
mean
had
they
been
talking
about
me
possibly
and
in
a
way
it
would
seem
that
was
not
altogether
flattering
to
my
vanity
unable
to
hide
my
sense
of
the
general
embarrassment
which
my
presence
had
called
forth
i
passed
to
the
seat
i
have
indicated
and
let
my
inquiring
look
settle
on
miss
lane
she
was
staring
in
imitation
of
the
others
straight
into
her
plate
but
as
i
saluted
her
with
a
quiet
good
morning
she
looked
up
and
acknowledged
my
courtesy
with
a
faint
almost
sympathetic
smile
at
once
the
whole
tableful
broke
again
into
chatter
and
i
could
safely
put
the
question
with
which
my
mind
was
full
how
is
miss
murray
i
asked
i
do
not
see
her
here
did
you
expect
to
poor
gilbertine
this
is
not
the
bridal
day
she
expected
then
with
irresistible
naïveté
entirely
in
keeping
with
her
figure
and
girlish
face
she
added
i
think
it
was
just
horrid
in
the
old
woman
to
die
the
night
before
the
wedding
do
you
indeed
i
do
i
emphatically
rejoined
humoring
her
in
the
hope
of
learning
what
i
wished
to
know
does
miss
murray
still
cherish
the
expectation
of
being
married
no
one
seems
to
know
nor
do
i
have
seen
her
since
the
middle
of
the
night
she
come
back
to
her
room
they
say
she
is
sobbing
out
her
terror
and
disappointment
in
some
attic
corner
think
of
that
for
gilbertine
murray
but
even
that
is
better
than
the
sentence
trailed
away
into
an
indistinguishable
murmur
the
murmur
into
silence
was
it
because
of
a
fresh
lull
in
the
conversation
about
us
i
hardly
think
so
for
though
the
talk
was
presently
resumed
she
remained
silent
not
even
giving
the
least
sign
of
wishing
to
prolong
this
particular
topic
i
finished
my
coffee
as
soon
as
possible
and
quitted
the
room
but
not
before
many
had
preceded
me
the
hall
was
consequently
as
full
as
before
of
a
gossiping
crowd
i
was
on
the
point
of
bowing
myself
through
the
various
groups
blocking
my
way
to
the
library
door
when
i
noticed
renewed
signs
of
embarrassment
on
all
the
faces
turned
my
way
women
who
were
clustered
about
the
drew
back
and
some
others
sauntered
away
into
side
rooms
with
an
appearance
of
suddenly
wishing
to
go
somewhere
this
certainly
was
very
singular
especially
as
these
marks
of
disapproval
did
not
seem
to
be
directed
so
much
at
myself
as
at
some
one
behind
me
who
could
this
some
one
be
turning
quickly
i
cast
a
glance
up
the
staircase
before
which
i
stood
and
saw
the
figure
of
a
young
girl
dressed
in
black
hesitating
on
the
landing
this
young
girl
was
dorothy
camerden
and
it
took
but
a
moment
contemplation
of
the
scene
for
me
to
feel
assured
that
it
was
against
her
this
feeling
of
universal
constraint
had
been
directed
viii
gilbertine
speaks
knowing
my
darling
innocence
i
felt
the
insult
shown
her
in
my
heart
of
hearts
and
might
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
have
been
betrayed
into
an
unwise
utterance
of
my
indignation
if
at
that
moment
i
had
not
encountered
the
eye
of
armstrong
fixed
on
me
from
the
rear
hall
in
the
mingled
surprise
and
distress
he
displayed
i
saw
that
it
was
not
from
any
indiscretion
of
his
that
this
feeling
against
her
had
started
he
had
not
betrayed
the
trust
i
had
placed
in
him
yet
the
murmur
had
gone
about
which
virtually
ostracized
her
and
instead
of
confronting
the
eager
looks
of
friends
she
found
herself
met
by
averted
glances
and
coldly
turned
backs
and
soon
by
an
almost
empty
hall
she
flushed
as
she
realized
the
effect
of
her
presence
and
cast
me
an
agonized
look
which
without
her
expectation
perhaps
roused
every
instinct
of
chivalry
within
me
advancing
i
met
her
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
with
one
quick
word
seemed
to
restore
her
to
herself
be
patient
i
whispered
they
will
be
all
around
you
again
perhaps
sooner
go
into
the
conservatory
and
wait
she
gave
me
a
grateful
pressure
of
the
hand
while
i
bounded
up
stairs
determined
that
nothing
should
stop
me
from
finding
gilbertine
and
giving
her
the
letter
with
which
sinclair
had
intrusted
me
but
this
was
more
easily
planned
than
accomplished
when
i
had
reached
the
third
floor
an
unaccustomed
and
strange
spot
for
me
to
find
myself
in
i
at
first
found
no
one
who
could
tell
me
to
which
room
miss
murray
had
retired
then
when
i
did
come
across
a
stray
housemaid
and
she
with
an
extraordinary
stare
had
pointed
out
the
door
i
found
it
quite
impossible
to
gain
any
response
from
within
though
i
could
hear
a
quick
step
moving
restlessly
to
and
fro
and
now
and
then
catch
the
sound
of
a
smothered
sob
or
low
cry
the
wretched
girl
would
not
heed
me
though
i
told
her
who
i
was
and
that
i
had
a
letter
from
sinclair
in
my
hand
indeed
she
presently
became
perfectly
quiet
and
let
me
knock
again
and
again
till
the
situation
became
ridiculous
and
i
felt
obliged
to
draw
off
not
that
i
thought
of
yielding
no
i
would
stay
there
till
her
own
fancy
drove
her
to
open
the
door
or
till
armstrong
should
come
up
and
force
it
a
woman
upon
whom
so
many
interests
depended
would
not
be
allowed
to
remain
shut
up
the
whole
morning
her
position
as
a
possible
bride
forbade
it
guilty
or
innocent
she
must
show
herself
before
long
as
if
in
answer
to
my
expectation
a
figure
appeared
at
this
very
moment
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
it
was
dutton
the
butler
and
in
his
hand
he
held
a
telegram
he
seemed
astonished
to
see
me
there
but
passed
me
with
a
simple
bow
and
stopped
before
the
door
i
had
so
unavailingly
assailed
a
few
minutes
before
a
telegram
miss
he
shouted
as
no
answer
was
made
to
his
knock
armstrong
asked
me
to
bring
it
to
you
it
is
from
the
bishop
and
calls
for
an
immediate
reply
there
was
a
stir
within
but
the
door
did
not
open
meanwhile
i
had
sealed
and
thrust
forth
the
letter
i
had
held
concealed
in
my
breast
pocket
give
her
this
too
i
signified
and
pointed
to
the
crack
under
the
door
he
took
the
letter
laid
the
telegram
on
it
and
pushed
them
both
in
then
he
stood
up
and
eyed
the
unresponsive
panels
with
the
set
look
of
a
man
who
does
not
easily
yield
his
purpose
i
will
wait
for
the
answer
he
shouted
through
the
keyhole
and
falling
back
he
took
up
his
stand
against
the
opposite
wall
i
could
not
keep
him
company
there
withdrawing
into
a
big
dormer
window
i
waited
with
beating
heart
to
see
if
her
door
would
open
apparently
not
yet
as
i
still
lingered
i
heard
the
lock
turn
followed
by
the
sound
of
a
measured
but
hurried
step
dashing
from
my
retreat
i
reached
the
main
hall
in
time
to
see
miss
murray
disappear
toward
the
staircase
this
was
well
and
i
was
about
to
follow
when
to
my
astonishment
i
perceived
dutton
standing
in
the
doorway
she
had
just
left
staring
down
at
the
floor
with
a
puzzled
look
she
did
pick
up
the
letters
he
cried
in
amazement
she
just
walked
over
them
what
shall
i
do
now
it
the
strangest
thing
i
ever
saw
take
them
to
the
little
boudoir
over
the
porch
i
suggested
sinclair
is
there
and
if
she
is
not
on
her
way
to
join
him
now
she
certainly
will
be
soon
without
a
word
dutton
caught
up
the
letters
and
made
for
the
stairs
left
to
await
the
result
i
found
myself
so
worked
upon
that
i
wondered
how
much
longer
i
should
find
myself
able
to
endure
these
shifts
of
feeling
and
constantly
recurring
moments
of
extreme
suspense
to
escape
the
torture
of
my
own
thoughts
or
possibly
to
get
some
idea
of
how
dorothy
was
sustaining
an
ordeal
which
was
fast
destroying
my
own
i
prepared
to
go
down
stairs
what
was
my
astonishment
in
passing
the
little
boudoir
on
the
second
floor
to
find
its
door
ajar
and
the
place
empty
either
the
interview
between
sinclair
and
gilbertine
had
been
very
much
curtailed
or
it
had
not
yet
taken
place
with
a
heart
heavy
with
forebodings
i
no
longer
sought
to
analyze
i
made
my
way
down
and
reached
the
lower
step
of
the
great
staircase
just
as
a
girls
rushing
from
different
quarters
of
the
hall
surrounded
the
heavy
form
of
armstrong
coming
from
his
own
little
room
their
questions
made
a
small
hubbub
with
a
gesture
he
put
them
all
back
and
raising
his
voice
said
to
the
assembled
crowd
it
has
been
decided
by
miss
murray
that
under
the
circumstances
it
will
be
wiser
for
her
to
postpone
the
celebration
of
her
marriage
to
some
time
and
place
less
fraught
with
mournful
suggestions
a
telegram
has
just
been
sent
to
the
bishop
to
that
effect
and
while
we
all
suffer
from
this
disappointment
i
am
sure
there
is
no
one
here
who
will
not
see
the
propriety
of
her
decision
as
he
finished
gilbertine
appeared
behind
him
at
the
same
moment
i
caught
or
thought
i
did
the
flash
of
sinclair
eye
from
the
recesses
of
the
room
beyond
but
i
could
not
stop
to
make
sure
of
this
for
gilbertine
look
and
manner
were
such
as
to
draw
my
full
attention
and
it
was
with
a
mixture
of
almost
inexplicable
emotions
that
i
saw
her
thread
her
way
among
her
friends
in
a
state
of
high
feeling
which
made
her
blind
to
their
outstretched
hands
and
deaf
to
the
murmur
of
interest
and
sympathy
which
instinctively
followed
her
she
was
making
for
the
stairs
and
whatever
her
thoughts
whatever
the
state
of
her
mind
she
moved
superbly
in
her
pale
yet
seemingly
radiant
abstraction
i
watched
her
fascinated
yet
when
she
left
the
last
group
and
began
to
cross
the
small
square
of
carpet
which
alone
separated
us
i
stepped
down
and
aside
feeling
that
to
meet
her
eye
just
then
without
knowing
what
had
passed
between
her
and
sinclair
would
be
cruel
to
her
and
unbearable
to
myself
she
saw
the
movement
and
seemed
to
hesitate
an
instant
then
she
turned
for
one
brief
instant
in
my
direction
and
i
saw
her
smile
great
god
it
was
the
smile
of
innocence
fleeting
as
it
was
the
pride
that
was
in
it
the
sweet
assertion
and
the
joy
were
unmistakable
i
felt
like
springing
to
sinclair
side
in
the
gladness
of
my
relief
but
there
was
no
time
another
door
had
opened
down
the
hall
another
person
had
stepped
upon
the
scene
and
miss
murray
as
well
as
myself
recognized
by
the
hush
which
at
once
fell
upon
every
one
present
that
something
of
still
more
startling
import
awaited
us
armstrong
and
ladies
said
this
stranger
i
knew
he
was
a
stranger
by
the
studied
formality
of
the
former
bow
i
have
made
a
few
inquiries
since
i
came
here
a
short
time
ago
and
i
find
that
there
is
one
young
lady
in
the
house
who
ought
to
be
able
to
tell
me
better
than
any
one
else
under
what
circumstances
lansing
breathed
her
last
i
allude
to
her
niece
who
slept
in
the
adjoining
room
is
that
young
lady
here
her
name
if
i
remember
rightly
is
camerden
miss
dorothy
camerden
a
movement
as
of
denial
passed
from
group
to
group
down
the
hall
and
while
no
one
glanced
toward
the
library
and
some
did
glance
up
stairs
i
felt
the
dart
of
sudden
fear
or
was
it
hope
that
dorothy
hearing
her
name
called
would
leave
the
conservatory
and
proudly
confront
the
speaker
in
face
of
this
whole
suspicious
throng
but
no
dorothy
appeared
on
the
contrary
it
was
gilbertine
who
turned
and
with
an
air
of
authority
for
which
no
one
was
prepared
asked
in
tones
vibrating
with
feeling
has
this
gentleman
the
official
right
to
question
who
was
and
who
was
not
with
my
aunt
when
she
died
armstrong
who
showed
his
surprise
as
ingenuously
as
he
did
every
other
emotion
glanced
up
at
the
light
figure
hovering
over
them
from
the
staircase
and
made
out
to
answer
this
gentleman
has
every
right
miss
murray
he
is
the
coroner
of
the
town
accustomed
to
inquire
into
all
cases
of
sudden
death
then
she
vehemently
rejoined
her
pale
cheeks
breaking
out
into
a
scarlet
flush
above
which
her
eyes
shone
with
an
almost
unearthly
brilliancy
do
not
summon
dorothy
camerden
she
is
not
the
witness
you
want
i
am
i
am
the
one
who
uttered
that
scream
i
am
the
one
who
saw
our
aunt
die
dorothy
can
not
tell
you
what
took
place
in
her
room
and
at
her
bedside
for
dorothy
was
not
there
but
can
amazed
not
as
others
were
at
the
assertion
itself
but
at
the
manner
and
publicity
of
the
utterance
i
contemplated
this
surprising
girl
in
wonder
always
beautiful
always
spirited
and
proud
she
looked
at
that
moment
as
if
nothing
in
the
shape
of
fear
or
even
contumely
could
touch
her
she
faced
the
astonishment
of
her
best
friends
with
absolute
fearlessness
and
before
the
general
murmur
could
break
into
words
added
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
speak
thus
publicly
because
by
keeping
silent
so
long
i
have
allowed
a
false
impression
to
go
about
stunned
with
terror
i
found
it
impossible
to
speak
during
that
first
shock
besides
i
was
in
a
measure
to
blame
for
the
catastrophe
itself
and
lacked
courage
to
own
it
it
was
i
who
took
the
little
crystal
flask
into
my
aunt
room
i
had
been
fascinated
by
it
from
the
first
fascinated
enough
to
long
to
see
it
closer
and
to
hold
it
in
my
hand
but
i
was
ashamed
of
this
fascination
ashamed
i
mean
to
have
any
one
know
that
i
could
be
moved
by
such
a
childish
impulse
so
instead
of
taking
the
box
itself
which
might
easily
be
missed
i
simply
abstracted
the
tiny
vial
it
strikes
me
now
as
a
very
strange
thing
for
me
to
do
but
then
it
seemed
a
natural
enough
impulse
and
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
decided
satisfaction
i
carried
this
coveted
object
about
with
me
till
i
got
to
my
room
then
when
the
house
was
quiet
and
my
asleep
i
took
it
out
and
looked
at
it
and
feeling
an
irresistible
desire
to
share
my
amusement
with
my
cousin
i
stole
to
her
room
by
means
of
the
connecting
balcony
just
as
i
had
done
many
times
before
when
our
aunt
was
in
bed
and
asleep
but
unlike
any
previous
occasion
i
found
the
room
empty
dorothy
was
not
there
but
as
the
light
was
burning
high
i
knew
she
would
soon
be
back
and
so
ventured
to
step
in
instantly
i
heard
my
aunt
voice
she
was
awake
and
wanted
something
she
had
evidently
called
before
for
her
voice
was
sharp
with
impatience
and
she
used
some
very
harsh
words
when
she
heard
me
in
dorothy
room
she
shouted
again
and
as
i
have
always
been
accustomed
to
obey
her
commands
i
hastened
to
her
side
with
the
little
vial
concealed
in
my
hand
as
she
had
expected
to
see
dorothy
and
not
me
she
rose
up
in
unreasoning
anger
asking
where
my
cousin
was
and
why
i
was
not
in
bed
i
attempted
to
answer
her
but
she
would
not
listen
to
me
and
bade
me
turn
up
the
gas
which
i
did
then
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
mine
as
though
she
knew
i
was
trying
to
conceal
something
from
her
she
commanded
me
to
rearrange
her
hair
and
make
her
more
comfortable
this
i
could
not
do
with
the
tiny
flask
still
in
my
hand
so
with
a
quick
movement
which
i
hoped
would
pass
unobserved
i
slid
it
behind
some
bottles
standing
on
a
table
by
the
bedside
and
bent
to
do
what
she
required
but
to
attempt
to
escape
her
eye
was
useless
she
had
seen
my
action
and
at
once
began
to
feel
about
for
what
i
had
attempted
to
hide
from
her
coming
in
contact
with
the
tiny
flask
she
seized
it
and
with
a
smile
i
shall
never
forget
held
it
up
between
us
this
she
cried
showing
such
astonishment
at
its
minuteness
and
perfection
of
shape
that
it
was
immediately
apparent
she
had
heard
nothing
of
the
amethyst
box
displayed
by
sinclair
in
the
library
never
saw
a
bottle
as
small
as
this
before
what
is
in
it
and
why
were
you
so
afraid
of
my
seeing
it
as
she
spoke
she
attempted
to
wrench
out
the
stopper
it
stuck
so
i
was
in
hopes
she
would
fail
in
the
effort
but
she
was
a
woman
of
uncommon
strength
and
presently
it
yielded
and
i
saw
the
vial
open
in
her
hand
aghast
with
terror
i
caught
at
the
table
beside
me
fearing
to
drop
before
her
eyes
instantly
her
look
of
curiosity
changed
to
one
of
suspicion
and
repeating
in
it
what
in
it
she
raised
the
flask
to
her
nostrils
and
when
she
found
she
could
make
out
nothing
from
the
smell
lowered
it
to
her
lips
with
the
intention
i
suppose
of
determining
its
contents
by
tasting
them
as
i
caught
sight
of
this
fatal
action
and
beheld
the
one
drop
which
sinclair
had
said
was
enough
to
kill
a
man
slip
from
its
of
centuries
into
her
open
throat
i
felt
as
if
the
poison
had
entered
my
own
veins
i
could
neither
speak
nor
move
but
when
an
instant
later
i
met
the
look
which
spread
suddenly
over
her
face
a
look
of
horror
and
hatred
accusing
horror
and
unspeakable
hatred
mingled
with
what
i
dimly
felt
must
mean
death
an
agonized
cry
burst
from
my
lips
after
which
panicstricken
i
flew
as
if
for
life
back
by
the
way
i
had
come
to
my
own
room
this
was
a
great
mistake
i
should
have
remained
with
my
aunt
and
boldly
met
the
results
of
the
tragedy
which
my
folly
had
brought
about
but
terror
knows
no
law
and
having
once
yielded
to
the
instinct
of
concealment
i
knew
no
other
course
than
to
continue
to
maintain
an
apparent
ignorance
of
what
had
just
occurred
with
chattering
teeth
and
an
awful
numbness
at
my
heart
i
tore
off
my
wrapper
and
slid
into
bed
miss
lane
had
not
wakened
but
every
one
else
had
and
the
hall
was
full
of
people
this
terrified
me
still
more
and
for
the
moment
i
felt
that
i
could
never
own
the
truth
and
bring
down
upon
myself
all
this
wonder
and
curiosity
so
i
allowed
a
wrong
impression
of
the
event
to
go
about
for
which
act
of
cowardice
i
now
ask
the
pardon
of
every
one
here
as
i
have
already
asked
that
of
sinclair
and
of
our
kind
friend
mr
armstrong
she
paused
and
stood
for
a
moment
confronting
us
all
with
proud
eyes
and
flaming
cheeks
then
amid
a
hubbub
which
did
not
seem
to
affect
her
in
the
least
she
stepped
down
and
approaching
the
man
who
she
had
been
told
had
a
right
to
her
full
confidence
she
said
loud
enough
for
all
who
wished
to
hear
her
i
am
ready
to
give
you
whatever
further
information
you
may
require
shall
i
step
into
the
with
you
he
bowed
and
as
they
disappeared
from
the
great
hall
the
hubbub
of
voices
became
tumultuous
naturally
i
should
have
joined
in
the
universal
expressions
of
surprise
and
the
gossip
incident
to
such
an
unexpected
revelation
but
i
found
myself
averse
to
any
kind
of
talk
till
i
could
meet
sinclair
eye
and
discern
in
it
the
happy
of
all
his
doubts
i
should
not
feel
free
to
be
my
own
ordinary
and
sociable
self
again
but
sinclair
showed
every
evidence
of
wishing
to
keep
in
the
background
and
while
this
was
natural
enough
so
far
as
people
in
general
were
concerned
i
thought
it
odd
and
very
unlike
him
not
to
give
me
an
opportunity
to
express
my
congratulations
at
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
and
the
frank
attitude
assumed
by
gilbertine
i
own
i
felt
much
disturbed
by
this
neglect
and
as
the
minutes
passed
and
he
failed
to
appear
i
found
my
satisfaction
in
her
explanations
dwindle
under
the
consciousness
that
they
had
failed
in
some
respects
to
account
for
the
situation
and
before
i
knew
it
i
was
the
prey
of
fresh
doubts
which
i
did
my
best
to
smother
not
only
for
the
sake
of
sinclair
but
because
i
was
still
too
much
under
the
influence
of
gilbertine
imposing
personality
to
wish
to
believe
aught
but
what
her
burning
words
conveyed
she
must
have
spoken
the
truth
but
was
it
the
entire
truth
i
hated
myself
for
asking
the
question
hated
myself
for
being
more
critical
with
her
than
i
had
been
with
dorothy
who
certainly
had
not
made
her
own
part
in
this
tragedy
as
clear
as
one
who
loved
her
could
wish
ah
dorothy
it
was
time
some
one
told
her
that
gilbertine
had
openly
vindicated
her
and
that
she
could
now
come
forth
and
face
her
friends
without
hesitation
and
without
dread
was
she
still
in
the
conservatory
doubtless
but
it
would
be
better
perhaps
for
me
to
make
sure
approaching
the
place
by
the
small
door
connecting
it
with
the
in
which
i
stood
i
took
a
hurried
look
within
and
seeing
no
one
stepped
boldly
down
between
the
palms
to
the
little
nook
where
lovers
of
this
quiet
spot
were
accustomed
to
sit
it
was
empty
and
so
was
the
library
beyond
coming
back
i
accosted
dutton
whom
i
found
superintending
the
removal
of
the
potted
plants
which
encumbered
the
passages
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
where
miss
camerden
was
he
answered
without
hesitation
that
she
had
stood
in
the
rear
hall
a
little
while
before
listening
to
miss
murray
that
she
had
then
gone
up
stairs
by
the
spiral
staircase
leaving
word
with
him
that
if
anybody
wanted
her
she
would
be
found
in
the
small
boudoir
over
the
porch
i
thanked
him
and
was
on
my
way
to
join
her
when
armstrong
called
me
he
must
have
kept
me
a
in
his
room
discussing
every
aspect
of
the
affair
and
apologizing
for
the
necessity
which
he
now
felt
for
bidding
farewell
to
most
of
his
guests
among
whom
he
was
careful
to
state
he
did
not
include
me
then
when
i
thought
this
topic
exhausted
he
began
to
talk
about
his
wife
and
what
this
dreadful
occurrence
was
to
her
and
how
he
despaired
of
ever
reconciling
her
to
the
fact
that
it
had
been
considered
necessary
to
call
in
a
coroner
then
he
spoke
of
sinclair
but
with
some
constraint
and
a
more
careful
choice
of
words
at
which
realizing
that
i
was
to
reap
nothing
from
this
interview
only
suffer
strong
and
continual
irritation
at
a
delay
which
was
costing
me
the
inestimable
privilege
of
being
the
first
to
tell
dorothy
of
her
reëstablishment
in
every
one
good
opinion
i
exerted
myself
for
release
and
to
such
good
purpose
that
i
presently
found
myself
again
in
the
hall
where
the
first
person
i
ran
against
was
sinclair
he
started
and
so
did
i
at
this
unexpected
encounter
then
we
stood
still
and
i
stared
at
him
in
amazement
for
everything
about
the
man
was
changed
and
inexplicable
fact
in
nothing
was
this
change
more
marked
than
in
his
attitude
toward
myself
yet
he
tried
to
be
friendly
and
meet
me
on
the
old
footing
and
observed
as
soon
as
we
found
ourselves
beyond
the
hearing
of
others
you
heard
what
gilbertine
said
there
is
no
reason
for
doubting
her
words
do
not
doubt
them
and
you
will
show
yourself
my
friend
by
not
doubting
them
either
then
with
some
impetuosity
and
a
gleam
in
his
eye
quite
foreign
to
its
natural
expression
he
pursued
with
a
pitiful
effort
to
speak
dispassionately
our
wedding
is
postponed
indefinitely
there
are
reasons
why
this
seemed
best
to
miss
murray
to
you
i
will
say
that
postponed
nuptials
seldom
culminate
in
marriage
in
fact
i
have
just
released
miss
murray
from
all
obligations
to
myself
the
stare
of
utter
astonishment
i
gave
him
called
up
a
flush
the
first
and
only
one
i
have
ever
seen
on
his
face
what
was
i
to
say
what
could
i
say
in
response
to
such
a
declaration
following
so
immediately
upon
his
warm
assertion
of
her
innocence
nothing
with
that
indefinable
chill
between
us
which
had
come
i
knew
not
how
i
felt
he
saw
my
embarrassment
possibly
my
emotion
for
he
smiled
somewhat
bitterly
and
put
a
step
or
so
between
us
before
he
remarked
miss
murray
has
my
good
wishes
out
of
respect
to
her
position
i
shall
show
her
a
friend
attention
while
we
remain
in
this
house
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
walter
you
and
i
have
held
our
last
conversation
on
this
subject
he
was
gone
before
i
had
sufficiently
recovered
to
realize
that
in
this
conversation
i
had
had
no
part
neither
had
it
contained
any
explanation
of
the
very
facts
which
had
once
formed
our
greatest
grounds
for
doubt
namely
beaton
dream
the
smothered
cry
uttered
behind
shoulder
when
he
first
made
known
the
deadly
qualities
of
the
little
vial
and
lastly
the
strange
desire
acknowledged
to
by
both
these
young
ladies
to
touch
and
hold
an
object
calculated
rather
to
repel
than
to
attract
the
normal
feminine
heart
at
every
previous
stage
of
this
drama
my
instinct
had
been
to
set
my
wits
against
the
facts
and
if
i
could
puzzle
out
the
mystery
but
i
felt
no
such
temptation
now
my
one
desire
was
to
act
and
that
immediately
dorothy
for
all
gilbertine
intimation
to
the
contrary
held
the
key
to
the
enigma
in
her
own
breast
otherwise
she
would
not
have
ventured
upon
that
surprising
and
necessarily
unpalatable
advice
to
sinclair
an
advice
he
seemed
to
have
followed
not
to
marry
gilbertine
murray
at
the
time
proposed
nothing
short
of
a
secret
acquaintanceship
with
facts
unknown
as
yet
to
the
rest
of
us
could
have
nerved
her
to
such
an
act
my
one
hope
then
of
understanding
the
matter
lay
with
her
to
seek
her
at
once
in
the
place
where
i
had
been
told
she
awaited
me
seemed
the
only
course
to
take
if
any
real
gratitude
underlay
the
look
of
trust
which
she
had
given
me
at
the
termination
of
our
last
interview
she
would
reward
my
confidence
in
her
by
unbosoming
herself
to
me
i
was
at
the
door
of
the
boudoir
immediately
upon
forming
this
resolution
finding
it
ajar
i
pushed
it
softly
open
and
as
softly
entered
to
my
astonishment
the
place
was
very
dark
not
only
had
the
shades
been
drawn
down
but
the
shutters
had
been
closed
so
that
it
was
with
difficulty
i
detected
the
slight
figure
which
lay
face
down
among
the
cushions
of
a
lounge
she
had
evidently
not
heard
my
entrance
for
she
did
not
move
and
struck
by
her
pathetic
attitude
i
advanced
in
a
whirl
of
feeling
which
made
me
forget
all
conventionalities
and
everything
else
in
fact
but
that
i
loved
her
and
had
the
utmost
confidence
in
her
power
to
make
me
happy
laying
my
hand
softly
on
her
head
i
tenderly
whispered
look
up
dear
whatever
barrier
may
have
intervened
between
us
has
fallen
look
up
and
hear
how
i
love
you
she
thrilled
as
a
woman
only
thrills
when
her
secret
soul
is
moved
and
rising
with
a
certain
grand
movement
turned
her
face
upon
me
glorious
with
a
feeling
that
not
even
the
dimness
of
the
room
could
hide
why
then
did
my
brain
whirl
and
my
heart
collapse
it
was
gilbertine
and
not
dorothy
who
stood
before
me
ix
in
the
little
boudoir
never
had
a
suspicion
crossed
my
mind
of
any
such
explanation
of
our
secret
troubles
i
had
seen
as
much
of
one
cousin
as
the
other
in
my
visits
to
lansing
house
but
gilbertine
being
from
the
first
day
of
our
acquaintance
engaged
to
my
friend
sinclair
i
naturally
did
not
presume
to
study
her
face
for
any
signs
of
interest
in
myself
even
if
my
sudden
and
uncontrollable
passion
for
dorothy
had
left
me
the
heart
to
do
so
yet
now
in
the
light
of
her
unmistakable
smile
of
her
beaming
eyes
from
which
all
troublous
thoughts
seemed
to
have
fled
for
ever
a
thousand
recollections
forced
themselves
upon
my
attention
which
not
only
made
me
bewail
my
own
blindness
but
which
served
to
explain
the
peculiar
attitude
always
maintained
toward
me
by
dorothy
and
many
other
things
which
a
moment
before
had
seemed
fraught
with
impenetrable
mystery
all
this
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
meanwhile
misled
by
my
words
gilbertine
drew
back
a
step
and
with
her
face
still
bright
with
the
radiance
i
have
mentioned
murmured
in
low
but
accents
not
just
yet
it
is
too
soon
let
me
simply
enjoy
the
fact
that
i
am
free
and
that
the
courage
to
win
my
release
came
from
my
own
suddenly
acquired
trust
in
sinclair
goodness
last
night
and
she
shuddered
i
saw
only
another
way
a
way
the
horrors
of
which
i
hardly
realized
but
god
saved
me
from
so
dreadful
yea
so
unnecessary
a
crime
and
this
morning
it
was
cruel
to
let
her
go
on
cruel
to
stand
there
and
allow
this
ardent
if
mistaken
nature
to
unfold
itself
so
ingenuously
while
i
with
ear
toward
the
door
listened
for
the
step
of
her
whom
i
had
never
so
much
loved
as
at
that
moment
possibly
because
i
had
only
just
come
to
understand
the
cause
of
her
seeming
vacillations
my
instincts
were
so
imperative
my
duty
and
the
obligations
of
my
position
so
unmistakable
that
i
made
a
move
as
she
reached
this
point
which
caused
gilbertine
first
to
hesitate
then
to
stop
how
should
i
fill
up
this
gap
of
silence
how
tell
her
of
the
great
the
grievous
mistake
she
had
made
the
task
was
one
to
try
the
courage
of
stouter
souls
than
mine
but
the
thought
of
dorothy
nerved
me
perhaps
also
my
real
friendship
and
commiseration
for
sinclair
gilbertine
i
began
i
will
make
no
pretense
of
misunderstanding
you
the
situation
is
too
serious
the
honor
which
you
do
me
too
great
only
i
am
not
free
to
accept
that
honor
the
words
which
i
uttered
were
meant
for
your
cousin
dorothy
i
expected
to
find
her
in
this
room
i
have
long
loved
your
cousin
in
secrecy
i
own
but
honestly
and
with
every
hope
of
some
day
making
her
my
wife
i
i
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
finish
the
warm
hand
turning
to
ice
in
my
clasp
the
eyes
the
recoil
the
maiden
flush
rising
deepening
covering
chin
and
cheek
and
forehead
then
fading
out
again
till
the
whole
face
was
white
as
marble
and
seemingly
as
cold
told
me
that
the
blow
had
gone
home
and
that
gilbertine
murray
the
unequalled
beauty
the
petted
darling
of
a
society
who
recognized
every
charm
she
possessed
save
her
ardent
nature
and
great
heart
had
reached
the
height
of
her
many
miseries
and
that
it
was
i
who
had
placed
her
there
overcome
with
pity
but
conscious
also
of
a
profound
respect
i
endeavored
to
utter
some
futile
words
which
she
at
once
put
an
end
to
by
an
appealing
gesture
you
can
say
nothing
she
began
i
have
made
an
awful
mistake
the
worst
a
woman
can
make
i
think
then
with
long
pauses
as
though
her
tongue
were
clogged
by
shame
perhaps
by
some
deeper
if
less
apparent
feeling
you
love
dorothy
does
dorothy
love
you
my
answer
was
an
honest
one
i
have
dared
to
hope
so
despite
the
little
opportunity
she
has
given
me
to
express
my
feelings
she
has
always
held
me
back
and
that
very
decidedly
or
my
devotion
would
have
been
apparent
to
everybody
oh
dorothy
regret
sorrow
infinite
tenderness
all
were
audible
in
that
cry
indeed
it
seemed
as
if
for
the
moment
her
thoughts
were
more
taken
up
with
her
cousin
unhappiness
than
with
her
own
how
i
must
have
made
her
suffer
i
have
been
a
curse
to
those
who
loved
me
but
i
am
humbled
now
and
very
rightly
i
began
to
experience
a
certain
awe
of
this
great
nature
there
was
grandeur
even
in
her
contrition
and
as
i
took
in
the
expression
of
her
colorless
features
sweet
with
almost
an
unearthly
sweetness
in
spite
of
the
anguish
consuming
her
i
suddenly
realized
what
sinclair
love
for
her
must
be
i
also
as
suddenly
realized
the
depth
and
extent
of
his
suffering
to
call
such
a
woman
his
to
lead
her
almost
to
the
foot
of
the
altar
and
then
to
see
her
turn
aside
and
leave
him
surely
his
lot
was
an
intolerable
one
and
though
the
interference
i
had
unconsciously
made
in
his
wishes
had
been
involuntary
i
felt
like
cursing
myself
for
not
having
been
more
open
in
my
attentions
to
the
girl
i
really
loved
gilbertine
seemed
to
divine
my
thoughts
for
pausing
at
the
door
she
had
unconsciously
approached
she
stood
with
the
knob
in
her
hand
and
with
averted
brow
remarked
gravely
i
am
going
out
of
your
life
before
i
do
so
however
i
should
like
to
say
a
few
words
in
palliation
of
my
conduct
i
have
never
known
a
mother
i
early
fell
under
my
aunt
charge
who
detesting
children
sent
me
away
to
school
where
i
was
well
enough
treated
but
never
loved
i
was
a
plain
child
and
felt
my
plainness
this
gave
an
awkwardness
to
my
actions
and
as
my
aunt
had
caused
it
to
be
distinctly
understood
that
her
sole
intention
in
sending
me
to
the
academy
was
to
have
me
educated
for
a
teacher
my
position
awakened
little
interest
and
few
hearts
if
any
warmed
toward
me
meanwhile
my
breast
was
filled
with
but
one
thought
one
absorbing
wish
i
longed
to
love
passionately
and
be
passionately
loved
in
return
had
i
found
a
mate
but
i
never
did
i
was
not
destined
for
any
such
happiness
years
passed
i
was
a
woman
but
neither
my
happiness
nor
my
had
kept
pace
with
my
growth
girls
who
once
passed
me
with
a
bare
nod
now
stopped
to
stare
sometimes
to
whisper
comments
behind
my
back
i
did
not
understand
this
change
and
withdrew
more
and
more
into
myself
and
the
made
for
me
by
books
romance
was
my
life
and
i
had
fallen
into
the
dangerous
habit
of
brooding
over
the
pleasures
and
excitements
which
would
have
been
mine
had
i
been
born
beautiful
and
wealthy
when
my
aunt
suddenly
visited
the
school
saw
me
and
at
once
took
me
away
and
placed
me
in
the
most
fashionable
school
in
new
york
city
from
there
i
was
launched
without
any
word
of
motherly
counsel
into
the
gay
society
you
know
so
well
almost
with
my
i
found
the
world
at
my
feet
and
though
my
aunt
showed
me
no
love
she
evinced
a
certain
pride
in
my
success
and
cast
about
to
procure
for
me
a
great
match
sinclair
was
the
victim
he
visited
me
took
me
to
theaters
and
eventually
proposed
my
aunt
was
in
ecstasies
i
who
felt
helpless
before
her
will
was
glad
that
the
husband
she
had
chosen
for
me
was
at
least
a
gentleman
and
to
all
appearances
respectable
in
his
living
and
nice
in
his
tastes
but
he
was
not
the
man
i
had
dwelt
on
in
my
dreams
and
while
i
accepted
him
it
was
not
possible
to
do
anything
else
with
my
aunt
controlling
every
action
if
not
every
thought
i
cared
so
little
for
sinclair
himself
that
i
forgot
to
ask
if
his
many
attentions
were
the
result
of
any
real
feeling
on
his
part
or
only
such
as
he
considered
due
to
the
woman
he
expected
to
make
his
wife
you
see
what
girls
are
how
i
despise
myself
now
for
this
miserable
frivolity
all
this
time
i
knew
that
i
was
not
my
aunt
only
niece
that
dorothy
camerden
of
whom
i
knew
little
but
her
name
was
as
closely
related
to
her
as
i
was
for
true
to
her
heartless
code
my
aunt
had
placed
us
in
separate
schools
and
we
had
never
met
when
she
found
that
i
was
to
leave
her
and
that
soon
there
would
be
nobody
to
see
that
her
dresses
were
bought
with
discretion
and
her
person
attended
to
with
something
like
care
she
sent
for
dorothy
i
shall
never
forget
my
first
impression
of
her
i
had
been
told
that
i
need
not
expect
much
in
the
way
of
beauty
and
style
but
from
my
first
glimpse
of
her
dear
face
i
saw
that
my
soul
friend
had
come
and
that
marriage
or
no
marriage
i
need
never
be
solitary
again
i
do
not
think
i
made
as
favorable
an
impression
on
my
cousin
as
she
did
on
me
dorothy
was
new
to
elaborate
dressing
and
to
all
the
follies
of
fashionable
life
and
her
look
had
more
of
awe
than
expectation
in
it
but
i
gave
her
a
hearty
kiss
and
in
a
week
she
was
as
brilliantly
equipped
as
myself
i
loved
her
but
from
blindness
of
eye
or
an
overwhelming
egotism
which
god
has
certainly
punished
i
did
not
consider
her
beautiful
this
i
must
acknowledge
to
you
if
only
to
complete
my
humiliation
i
never
imagined
for
a
moment
even
after
i
became
the
daily
witness
of
your
many
attentions
to
her
that
it
was
on
her
account
you
visited
the
house
so
often
i
had
been
so
petted
and
spoiled
since
entering
society
that
i
thought
you
were
kind
to
her
simply
because
honor
forbade
you
to
be
too
kind
to
me
and
seeing
in
you
a
man
different
from
the
others
one
who
who
pleased
me
as
the
heroes
of
my
old
romances
had
pleased
me
i
gave
you
all
my
heart
and
what
was
worse
my
folly
to
you
will
have
many
a
talk
with
her
in
the
future
and
some
day
she
may
succeed
in
proving
to
you
that
it
was
vanity
and
not
badness
of
heart
which
led
me
to
misunderstand
your
feelings
having
repressed
my
own
impulses
so
long
i
saw
in
your
reticence
the
evidences
of
a
like
struggle
and
when
immediately
upon
my
break
with
sinclair
you
entered
here
and
said
the
words
you
did
well
we
have
finished
with
this
subject
for
ever
the
explanations
which
i
gave
below
of
the
part
i
played
in
my
death
were
true
i
only
omitted
one
detail
which
you
may
consider
a
very
important
one
the
fact
which
paralyzed
my
hand
and
voice
when
i
saw
her
lift
the
drop
of
death
to
her
lips
was
this
i
had
meant
to
die
by
this
drop
myself
in
dorothy
room
and
with
dorothy
arms
about
me
this
was
my
secret
a
secret
which
no
one
can
blame
me
for
keeping
as
long
as
i
could
and
one
which
i
should
hardly
have
the
courage
to
disclose
to
you
now
if
i
had
not
already
parted
with
it
to
the
coroner
who
would
not
credit
my
story
till
i
had
told
him
the
whole
truth
gilbertine
i
prayed
for
i
saw
her
fingers
closing
upon
the
knob
she
had
held
lightly
till
now
do
not
go
till
i
have
said
this
a
young
girl
does
not
always
know
the
demands
of
her
own
nature
the
heart
you
have
ignored
is
one
in
a
thousand
do
not
let
it
slip
from
you
god
never
gives
a
woman
such
a
love
twice
i
know
it
she
murmured
and
turned
the
knob
i
thought
she
was
gone
and
let
the
sigh
which
had
been
laboring
at
my
breast
have
vent
when
suddenly
i
caught
one
last
word
whispered
from
the
threshold
throw
back
the
shutters
and
let
in
the
light
dorothy
is
coming
i
am
going
now
to
call
her
an
hour
had
passed
the
hour
of
hours
for
me
for
in
it
the
sun
of
my
happiness
rose
and
dorothy
and
i
came
to
understand
each
other
we
were
sitting
hand
in
hand
in
this
blessed
little
boudoir
when
suddenly
she
turned
her
sweet
face
toward
me
and
gently
remarked
this
seems
like
selfishness
on
our
part
but
gilbertine
insisted
do
you
know
what
she
is
doing
now
helping
old
cummings
and
holding
barnstable
baby
while
her
maid
packs
she
will
work
like
that
all
day
and
with
a
smile
too
oh
it
is
a
rich
nature
an
ideal
nature
i
think
we
can
trust
her
now
i
did
not
like
to
discuss
gilbertine
even
with
dorothy
so
i
said
nothing
but
she
was
too
full
of
her
theme
to
stop
i
think
she
wished
to
unburden
her
mind
once
and
for
ever
of
all
that
had
disturbed
it
our
aunt
death
she
continued
will
be
a
sort
of
emancipation
for
her
i
do
think
you
or
any
one
out
of
our
immediate
household
can
realize
the
control
which
aunt
hannah
exerted
over
every
one
who
came
within
her
daily
influence
it
would
have
been
the
same
had
she
occupied
a
dependent
position
instead
of
being
the
wealthy
autocrat
she
was
in
her
cold
nature
dwelt
an
imperiousness
which
no
one
could
withstand
you
know
how
her
friends
some
of
them
as
rich
and
influential
as
herself
bowed
to
her
will
and
submitted
to
her
interference
what
then
could
you
expect
from
two
poor
girls
entirely
dependent
upon
her
for
everything
they
enjoyed
gilbertine
with
all
her
spirit
could
not
face
aunt
hannah
frown
while
i
studied
to
have
no
wishes
had
this
been
otherwise
had
we
found
a
friend
instead
of
a
tyrant
in
the
woman
who
took
us
into
her
home
gilbertine
might
have
gained
more
control
over
her
feelings
it
was
the
necessity
she
felt
of
smothering
her
natural
impulses
and
of
maintaining
in
the
house
and
before
the
world
an
appearance
of
satisfaction
in
her
position
as
which
caused
her
to
fall
into
such
extremes
of
despondency
and
deep
despair
her
was
shocked
she
felt
that
she
was
living
a
lie
and
hated
herself
in
consequence
you
may
think
i
did
wrong
not
to
tell
her
of
your
affection
for
myself
especially
after
what
you
whispered
into
my
ear
that
night
at
the
theater
i
did
do
wrong
i
see
it
now
she
was
really
a
stronger
woman
than
i
thought
and
we
might
all
have
been
saved
the
horrors
which
have
befallen
us
had
i
acted
with
more
firmness
at
that
time
but
i
was
weak
and
frightened
i
held
you
back
and
let
her
go
on
deceiving
herself
which
meant
deceiving
sinclair
too
i
thought
when
she
found
herself
really
married
and
settled
in
her
own
home
she
would
find
it
easier
to
forget
and
that
soon
perhaps
very
soon
all
this
would
seem
like
a
troubled
dream
to
her
and
there
was
reason
for
this
hope
on
my
part
she
showed
a
woman
natural
interest
in
her
outfit
and
the
plans
for
her
new
house
but
when
she
heard
you
were
to
be
sinclair
best
man
every
feminine
instinct
within
her
rebelled
and
it
was
with
difficulty
she
could
prevent
herself
from
breaking
out
into
a
loud
no
in
face
of
aunt
and
lover
from
this
moment
on
her
state
of
mind
grew
desperate
in
the
parlor
at
the
theater
she
was
the
brilliant
girl
whom
all
admired
and
many
envied
but
in
my
little
room
at
night
she
would
bury
her
face
in
my
lap
and
talk
of
death
till
i
moved
in
a
constant
atmosphere
of
dread
yet
because
she
looked
gay
and
laughed
i
turned
a
like
face
to
the
world
and
laughed
also
we
felt
it
was
expected
of
us
and
the
very
nervous
tension
we
were
under
made
these
ebullitions
easy
but
i
did
not
laugh
so
much
after
coming
here
one
night
i
found
her
out
of
her
bed
long
after
every
one
else
had
retired
for
the
night
next
morning
beaton
told
a
dream
i
hope
it
was
a
dream
but
it
frightened
me
then
came
that
moment
when
sinclair
displayed
the
amethyst
box
and
explained
with
such
a
nonchalant
air
how
a
drop
from
the
little
flask
inside
would
kill
a
person
a
toy
but
so
deadly
i
felt
the
thrill
which
shot
like
lightning
through
her
and
made
up
my
mind
she
should
never
have
the
opportunity
of
touching
that
box
and
that
is
why
i
stole
into
the
library
at
the
first
moment
i
had
to
myself
and
took
down
the
little
box
and
hid
it
in
my
hair
i
never
thought
to
look
inside
i
did
not
pause
to
think
that
it
was
the
flask
and
not
the
box
she
wanted
and
consequently
felt
convinced
of
her
safety
so
long
as
i
kept
the
latter
successfully
concealed
in
my
hair
you
know
the
rest
yes
i
knew
it
how
she
opened
the
box
in
her
room
and
found
it
empty
how
she
flew
to
gilbertine
room
and
finding
the
door
unlocked
looked
in
and
saw
miss
lane
lying
there
asleep
but
no
gilbertine
how
her
alarm
grew
at
this
and
how
forgetting
that
her
cousin
often
stole
to
her
room
by
means
of
the
connecting
balcony
she
had
wandered
over
the
house
in
the
hope
of
coming
upon
gilbertine
in
one
of
the
rooms
how
her
mind
misgave
her
before
she
had
entered
the
great
hall
and
how
she
turned
back
only
to
hear
that
awful
scream
go
up
as
she
was
setting
foot
upon
the
spiral
stair
i
had
heard
it
all
before
and
could
imagine
her
terror
and
dismay
and
why
she
found
it
impossible
to
proceed
any
further
but
clung
to
the
and
till
she
was
found
there
by
those
seeking
her
and
taken
up
to
her
aunt
room
but
she
never
told
me
and
i
do
not
yet
know
what
her
thoughts
or
feelings
were
when
instead
of
seeing
her
cousin
outstretched
in
death
on
the
bed
they
led
her
to
she
beheld
the
lifeless
figure
of
her
aunt
the
reserve
she
maintained
on
this
point
has
been
always
respected
by
me
let
it
continue
to
be
so
when
therefore
she
said
you
know
the
rest
i
took
her
in
my
arms
and
gave
her
my
first
kiss
then
i
softly
released
her
and
by
tacit
consent
we
each
went
our
way
for
that
day
mine
took
me
into
the
hall
below
which
was
all
alive
with
the
hum
of
departing
guests
beaton
was
among
them
and
as
he
stepped
out
on
the
porch
i
gave
him
a
parting
handclasp
and
quietly
whispered
when
all
dark
things
are
made
light
you
will
find
that
there
was
both
more
and
less
to
your
dream
than
you
were
inclined
to
make
out
he
bowed
and
that
was
the
last
word
which
ever
passed
between
us
on
this
topic
but
what
chiefly
impressed
me
in
connection
with
this
afternoon
events
was
the
short
talk
i
had
with
sinclair
i
feared
i
forced
this
talk
but
i
could
not
let
the
dreary
day
settle
into
still
drearier
night
without
making
clear
to
him
a
point
which
in
the
new
position
he
held
toward
gilbertine
if
not
toward
myself
might
seem
to
be
involved
in
some
doubt
when
therefore
i
had
the
opportunity
to
accost
him
i
did
so
and
without
noting
the
formal
bow
with
which
he
strove
to
hold
back
all
confidential
communication
i
said
it
is
not
a
very
propitious
time
for
me
to
intrude
my
personal
affairs
upon
you
but
i
feel
as
if
i
should
like
you
to
know
that
the
clouds
have
been
cleared
away
between
dorothy
and
myself
and
that
some
day
we
expect
to
marry
he
gave
me
the
earnest
look
of
a
man
who
has
recovered
his
one
friend
then
he
grasped
my
hand
warmly
saying
with
something
like
his
old
fervor
you
deserve
all
the
happiness
that
awaits
you
mine
is
gone
but
if
i
can
regain
it
i
will
trust
me
for
that
worthington
the
coroner
who
had
seen
much
of
life
and
human
nature
managed
with
much
discretion
the
inquest
he
felt
bound
to
hold
lansing
was
found
to
have
come
to
her
death
by
a
meddlesome
interference
with
one
of
her
niece
wedding
trinkets
and
as
every
one
acquainted
with
lansing
knew
her
to
be
quite
capable
of
such
an
act
of
malicious
folly
the
verdict
was
duly
accepted
and
the
real
heart
of
this
tragedy
closed
for
ever
from
every
human
eye
as
we
were
leaving
newport
sinclair
stepped
up
to
me
i
have
reason
to
know
said
he
that
lansing
bequests
will
be
a
surprise
not
only
to
her
nieces
but
to
the
world
at
large
let
me
advise
you
to
announce
your
engagement
before
reaching
new
york
i
followed
his
advice
and
in
a
few
days
understood
why
it
had
been
given
all
the
vast
property
owned
by
this
woman
had
been
left
to
dorothy
gilbertine
had
been
cut
off
without
a
cent
we
never
knew
lansing
reason
for
this
act
gilbertine
had
always
been
considered
her
favorite
and
had
the
will
been
a
late
one
it
would
have
been
generally
thought
that
she
had
left
her
thus
unprovided
for
solely
in
consideration
of
the
great
match
which
she
expected
her
to
make
but
the
will
was
dated
back
several
years
long
before
gilbertine
had
met
sinclair
long
before
either
niece
had
come
to
live
with
lansing
in
new
york
had
it
always
been
the
wish
then
to
enrich
the
one
and
slight
the
other
it
would
seem
so
but
why
should
the
slighted
one
be
gilbertine
the
only
explanation
i
ever
heard
given
was
the
partiality
which
lansing
felt
for
dorothy
mother
or
rather
her
lack
of
affection
for
gilbertine
god
knows
if
it
is
the
true
one
but
whether
so
or
not
the
discrimination
she
showed
in
her
will
put
poor
gilbertine
in
a
very
unfortunate
position
at
least
it
would
have
done
so
if
sinclair
with
an
adroitness
worthy
of
his
love
had
not
proved
to
her
that
a
break
at
this
time
in
their
supposed
relations
would
reflect
most
seriously
upon
his
disinterestedness
and
thus
secured
for
himself
opportunities
for
urging
his
suit
which
ended
as
such
opportunities
often
do
in
a
renewal
of
their
engagement
but
this
time
mutual
love
was
its
basis
this
was
evident
to
any
one
who
saw
them
together
but
how
the
magic
was
wrought
how
this
heart
learned
at
last
its
true
allegiance
i
did
not
know
till
later
and
then
it
was
told
me
by
gilbertine
herself
i
had
been
married
for
some
months
and
she
for
some
weeks
when
one
evening
chance
threw
us
together
instantly
and
as
if
she
had
waited
for
this
hour
she
turned
upon
me
with
the
beautiful
smile
which
has
been
hers
ever
since
her
new
happiness
came
to
her
and
said
you
once
gave
me
some
very
good
advice
worthington
but
it
was
not
that
which
led
me
to
realize
sinclair
affection
it
was
a
short
conversation
which
passed
between
us
on
the
day
my
aunt
will
was
read
do
you
remember
my
turning
to
speak
to
him
the
moment
after
that
word
fell
from
the
lawyer
lips
yes
mrs
sinclair
alas
did
i
not
it
was
one
of
the
most
poignant
memories
of
my
life
the
look
she
gave
him
and
the
look
he
gave
her
indeed
i
did
remember
it
was
to
ask
him
one
question
a
question
to
which
misfortune
only
could
have
given
so
much
weight
had
my
aunt
taken
him
into
her
confidence
had
he
known
that
i
had
no
place
in
her
will
his
answer
was
very
simple
a
single
word
but
after
that
do
i
need
to
say
why
i
am
a
wife
why
i
am
wife
the
house
in
the
mist
i
an
open
door
it
was
a
night
to
drive
any
man
indoors
not
only
was
the
darkness
impenetrable
but
the
raw
mist
enveloping
hill
and
valley
made
the
open
road
anything
but
desirable
to
a
belated
wayfarer
like
myself
being
young
untrammeled
and
naturally
indifferent
to
danger
i
was
not
averse
to
adventure
and
having
my
fortune
to
make
was
always
on
the
lookout
for
el
dorado
which
to
ardent
souls
lies
ever
beyond
the
next
turning
consequently
when
i
saw
a
light
shimmering
through
the
mist
at
my
right
i
resolved
to
make
for
it
and
the
shelter
it
so
opportunely
offered
but
i
did
not
realize
then
as
i
do
now
that
shelter
does
not
necessarily
imply
refuge
or
i
might
not
have
undertaken
this
adventure
with
so
light
a
heart
yet
who
knows
the
impulses
of
an
unfettered
spirit
lean
toward
daring
and
youth
as
i
have
said
seeks
the
strange
the
unknown
and
sometimes
the
terrible
my
path
toward
this
light
was
by
no
means
an
easy
one
after
confused
wanderings
through
tangled
hedges
and
a
struggle
with
obstacles
of
whose
nature
i
received
the
most
curious
impression
in
the
surrounding
murk
i
arrived
in
front
of
a
long
low
building
which
to
my
astonishment
i
found
standing
with
doors
and
windows
open
to
the
pervading
mist
save
for
one
square
casement
through
which
the
light
shone
from
a
row
of
candles
placed
on
a
long
mahogany
table
the
quiet
and
seeming
emptiness
of
this
odd
and
picturesque
building
made
me
pause
i
am
not
much
affected
by
visible
danger
but
this
silent
room
with
its
air
of
sinister
expectancy
struck
me
most
unpleasantly
and
i
was
about
to
reconsider
my
first
impulse
and
withdraw
again
to
the
road
when
a
second
look
thrown
back
upon
the
comfortable
interior
i
was
leaving
convinced
me
of
my
folly
and
sent
me
straight
toward
the
door
which
stood
so
invitingly
open
but
up
the
path
my
progress
was
again
stayed
by
the
sight
of
a
man
issuing
from
the
house
i
had
so
rashly
looked
upon
as
devoid
of
all
human
presence
he
seemed
in
haste
and
at
the
moment
my
eye
first
fell
on
him
was
engaged
in
replacing
his
watch
in
his
pocket
but
he
did
not
shut
the
door
behind
him
which
i
thought
odd
especially
as
his
final
glance
had
been
a
backward
one
and
seemed
to
take
in
all
the
appointments
of
the
place
he
was
so
hurriedly
leaving
as
we
met
he
raised
his
hat
this
likewise
struck
me
as
peculiar
for
the
deference
he
displayed
was
more
marked
than
that
usually
bestowed
on
strangers
while
his
lack
of
surprise
at
an
encounter
more
or
less
startling
in
such
a
mist
was
calculated
to
puzzle
an
ordinary
man
like
myself
indeed
he
was
so
little
impressed
by
my
presence
there
that
he
was
for
passing
me
without
a
word
or
any
other
hint
of
good
fellowship
save
the
bow
of
which
i
have
spoken
but
this
did
not
suit
me
i
was
hungry
cold
and
eager
for
creature
comforts
and
the
house
before
me
gave
forth
not
only
heat
but
a
savory
odor
which
in
itself
was
an
invitation
hard
to
ignore
i
therefore
accosted
the
man
will
bed
and
supper
be
provided
me
here
i
asked
i
am
tired
out
with
a
long
tramp
over
the
hills
and
hungry
enough
to
pay
anything
in
reason
i
stopped
for
the
man
had
disappeared
he
had
not
paused
at
my
appeal
and
the
mist
had
swallowed
him
but
at
the
break
in
my
sentence
his
voice
came
back
in
tones
and
i
heard
supper
will
be
ready
at
nine
and
there
are
beds
for
all
enter
sir
you
are
the
first
to
arrive
but
the
others
can
not
be
far
behind
a
queer
greeting
certainly
but
when
i
strove
to
question
him
as
to
its
meaning
his
voice
returned
to
me
from
such
a
distance
that
i
doubted
if
my
words
had
reached
him
with
any
more
distinctness
than
his
answer
reached
me
well
thought
i
it
is
as
if
a
lodging
had
been
denied
me
he
invited
me
to
enter
and
enter
i
will
the
house
to
which
i
now
naturally
directed
a
glance
of
much
more
careful
scrutiny
than
before
was
no
ordinary
but
a
rambling
old
mansion
made
conspicuously
larger
here
and
there
by
jutting
porches
and
more
than
one
convenient
though
furnished
warmed
and
lighted
with
candles
as
i
have
previously
described
it
had
about
it
an
air
of
disuse
which
made
me
feel
myself
an
intruder
in
spite
of
the
welcome
i
had
received
but
i
was
not
in
a
position
to
stand
upon
ceremony
and
ere
long
i
found
myself
inside
the
great
room
and
before
the
blazing
logs
whose
glow
had
lighted
up
the
doorway
and
added
its
own
attraction
to
the
other
allurements
of
the
inviting
place
though
the
open
door
made
a
draft
which
was
anything
but
pleasant
i
did
not
feel
like
closing
it
and
was
astonished
to
observe
the
effect
of
the
mist
through
the
square
thus
left
open
to
the
night
it
was
not
an
agreeable
one
and
instinctively
turning
my
back
upon
that
quarter
of
the
room
i
let
my
eyes
roam
over
the
wainscoted
walls
and
the
odd
pieces
of
furniture
which
gave
such
an
air
of
richness
to
the
place
as
nothing
of
the
kind
had
ever
fallen
under
my
eyes
before
i
should
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
opportunity
of
gratifying
my
taste
for
the
curious
and
the
beautiful
if
the
quaint
old
chairs
i
saw
standing
about
me
on
every
side
had
not
all
been
empty
but
the
solitude
of
the
place
so
much
more
oppressive
than
the
solitude
of
the
road
i
had
left
struck
cold
to
my
heart
and
i
missed
the
cheer
rightfully
belonging
to
such
attractive
surroundings
suddenly
i
bethought
me
of
the
many
other
apartments
likely
to
be
found
in
so
spacious
a
dwelling
and
going
to
the
nearest
door
i
opened
it
and
called
out
for
the
master
of
the
house
but
only
an
echo
came
back
and
returning
to
the
fire
i
sat
down
before
the
cheering
blaze
in
quiet
acceptance
of
a
situation
too
lonely
for
comfort
yet
not
without
a
certain
piquant
interest
for
a
man
of
free
mind
and
adventurous
disposition
like
myself
after
all
if
supper
was
to
be
served
at
nine
someone
must
be
expected
to
eat
it
i
should
surely
not
be
left
much
longer
without
companions
meanwhile
ample
amusement
awaited
me
in
the
contemplation
of
a
picture
which
next
to
the
large
fireplace
was
the
most
prominent
object
in
the
room
this
picture
was
a
portrait
and
a
remarkable
one
the
countenance
it
portrayed
was
both
characteristic
and
forcible
and
so
interested
me
that
in
studying
it
i
quite
forgot
both
hunger
and
weariness
indeed
its
effect
upon
me
was
such
that
after
gazing
at
it
uninterruptedly
for
a
few
minutes
i
discovered
that
its
various
features
the
narrow
eyes
in
which
a
hint
of
craft
gave
a
strange
gleam
to
their
native
intelligence
the
steadfast
chin
strong
as
the
rock
of
the
hills
i
had
wearily
tramped
all
day
the
cunning
wrinkles
which
yet
did
not
interfere
with
a
latent
that
made
the
face
as
attractive
as
it
was
puzzling
had
so
established
themselves
in
my
mind
that
i
continued
to
see
them
before
me
whichever
way
i
turned
and
found
it
impossible
to
shake
off
their
influence
even
after
i
had
resolutely
set
my
mind
in
another
direction
by
endeavoring
to
recall
what
i
knew
of
the
town
into
which
i
had
strayed
i
had
come
from
scranton
and
was
now
according
to
my
best
judgment
in
one
of
those
rural
districts
of
western
pennsylvania
which
breed
such
strange
and
sturdy
characters
but
of
this
special
neighborhood
its
inhabitants
and
its
industries
i
knew
nothing
nor
was
likely
to
so
long
as
i
remained
in
the
solitude
i
have
endeavored
to
describe
but
these
impressions
and
these
thoughts
if
thoughts
they
were
presently
received
a
check
a
loud
halloo
rose
from
somewhere
in
the
mist
followed
by
a
string
of
muttered
imprecations
which
convinced
me
that
the
person
now
attempting
to
approach
the
house
was
encountering
some
of
the
many
difficulties
which
had
beset
me
in
the
same
undertaking
a
few
minutes
before
i
therefore
raised
my
voice
and
shouted
out
here
this
way
after
which
i
sat
still
and
awaited
developments
there
was
a
huge
clock
in
one
of
the
corners
whose
loud
tick
filled
up
every
interval
of
silence
by
this
clock
it
was
just
ten
minutes
to
eight
when
two
gentlemen
i
should
say
men
and
coarse
men
at
that
crossed
the
open
threshold
and
entered
the
house
their
appearance
was
more
or
less
unpleasantly
so
i
am
obliged
to
add
one
was
and
obese
the
other
was
tall
thin
and
wiry
and
showed
as
many
seams
in
his
face
as
a
blighted
apple
neither
of
the
two
had
anything
to
recommend
him
either
in
appearance
or
address
save
a
certain
veneer
of
polite
assumption
as
transparent
as
it
was
offensive
as
i
listened
to
the
forced
sallies
of
the
one
and
the
hollow
laugh
of
the
other
i
was
glad
that
i
was
large
of
frame
and
strong
of
arm
and
used
to
all
kinds
of
men
and
brutes
as
these
two
seemed
no
more
astonished
at
my
presence
than
the
man
i
had
met
at
the
gate
i
checked
the
question
which
instinctively
rose
to
my
lips
and
with
a
simple
bow
responded
to
by
a
more
or
less
familiar
nod
from
either
accepted
the
situation
with
all
the
the
occasion
seemed
to
demand
perhaps
this
was
wise
perhaps
it
was
not
there
was
little
opportunity
to
judge
for
the
start
they
both
gave
as
they
encountered
the
eyes
of
the
picture
before
mentioned
drew
my
attention
to
a
consideration
of
the
different
ways
in
which
men
however
similar
in
other
respects
express
sudden
and
emotion
the
big
man
simply
allowed
his
astonishment
dread
or
whatever
the
feeling
was
which
moved
him
to
ooze
forth
in
a
cold
and
deathly
perspiration
which
robbed
his
cheeks
of
color
and
cast
a
bluish
shadow
over
his
narrow
and
retreating
temples
while
the
thin
and
waspish
man
caught
in
the
same
trap
for
trap
i
saw
it
was
shouted
aloud
in
his
mirth
the
false
and
cruel
character
of
which
would
have
made
me
shudder
if
all
expression
of
feeling
on
my
part
had
not
been
held
in
check
by
the
interest
i
immediately
experienced
in
the
display
of
open
bravado
with
which
in
another
moment
these
two
tried
to
carry
off
their
mutual
embarrassment
good
likeness
eh
laughed
the
man
quite
an
idea
that
makes
him
one
of
us
again
well
he
welcome
in
oils
ca
say
much
to
us
from
canvas
eh
and
the
rafters
above
him
vibrated
as
his
violent
efforts
at
joviality
went
up
in
loud
and
louder
assertion
from
his
thin
throat
a
nudge
from
the
other
elbow
stopped
him
and
i
saw
them
both
cast
glances
in
my
direction
one
of
the
witherspoon
boys
queried
one
perhaps
snarled
the
other
i
never
saw
but
one
of
them
there
are
five
are
there
eustace
believed
in
marrying
off
his
gals
young
damn
him
yes
and
he
have
married
them
off
younger
if
he
had
known
how
numbers
were
going
to
count
some
day
among
the
westonhaughs
and
he
laughed
again
in
a
way
i
should
certainly
have
felt
it
my
business
to
resent
if
my
indignation
as
well
as
the
allusions
which
had
called
it
forth
had
not
been
put
to
an
end
by
a
fresh
arrival
through
the
veiling
mist
which
hung
like
a
shroud
at
the
doorway
this
time
it
was
for
me
to
experience
a
shock
of
something
like
fear
yet
the
personage
who
called
up
this
sensation
in
my
naturally
hardy
nature
was
old
and
to
all
appearance
harmless
from
disability
if
not
from
good
will
his
form
was
bent
over
upon
itself
like
a
bow
and
only
from
the
glances
he
shot
from
his
upturned
eyes
was
the
fact
made
evident
that
a
redoubtable
nature
full
of
force
and
malignity
had
just
brought
its
quota
of
evil
into
a
room
already
overflowing
with
dangerous
and
menacing
passions
as
this
old
wretch
either
from
the
feebleness
of
age
or
from
the
infirmity
i
have
mentioned
had
great
difficulty
in
walking
he
had
brought
with
him
a
small
boy
whose
business
it
was
to
direct
his
tottering
steps
as
best
he
could
but
once
settled
in
his
chair
he
drove
away
this
boy
with
his
pointed
oak
stick
and
with
some
harsh
words
about
caring
for
the
horse
and
being
on
time
in
the
morning
he
sent
him
out
into
the
mist
as
this
little
shivering
and
pathetic
figure
vanished
the
old
man
drew
with
gasp
and
haw
a
number
of
deep
breaths
which
shook
his
bent
back
and
did
their
share
no
doubt
in
restoring
his
own
disturbed
circulation
then
with
a
sinister
twist
which
brought
his
pointed
chin
and
twinkling
eyes
again
into
view
he
remarked
have
ye
a
word
for
kinsman
luke
you
two
it
is
often
i
get
out
among
ye
shakee
nephew
shakee
hector
and
now
who
the
boy
in
the
window
my
eyes
are
what
they
used
to
be
but
he
do
seem
to
favor
the
westonhaughs
one
of
salmon
four
grandchildren
think
or
a
shoot
from
eustace
gnarled
old
trunk
his
gals
all
married
americans
and
one
of
them
i
been
told
was
a
giant
like
this
fellow
as
this
description
pointed
directly
toward
me
i
was
about
to
venture
a
response
on
my
own
account
when
my
attention
as
well
as
theirs
was
freshly
attracted
by
a
loud
whoa
at
the
gate
followed
by
the
hasty
but
assured
entrance
of
a
dapper
wizen
but
perfectly
preserved
little
old
gentleman
with
a
bag
in
his
hand
looking
askance
with
eyes
that
were
like
two
beads
first
at
the
two
men
who
were
now
elbowing
each
other
for
the
best
place
before
the
fire
and
then
at
the
revolting
figure
in
the
chair
he
bestowed
his
greeting
which
consisted
of
an
elaborate
bow
not
on
them
but
upon
the
picture
hanging
so
conspicuously
on
the
open
wall
before
him
and
then
taking
me
within
the
scope
of
his
quick
circling
glance
cried
out
with
an
assumption
of
great
cordiality
good
evening
gentlemen
good
evening
one
good
evening
all
nothing
like
being
on
the
tick
i
sorry
the
night
has
turned
out
so
badly
some
may
find
it
too
thick
for
travel
that
would
be
bad
eh
very
bad
for
as
none
of
the
men
he
openly
addressed
saw
fit
to
answer
save
by
the
hitch
of
a
shoulder
or
a
leer
quickly
suppressed
i
kept
silent
also
but
this
reticence
marked
as
it
was
did
not
seem
to
offend
the
shaking
the
wet
from
the
umbrella
he
held
he
stood
the
dripping
article
up
in
a
corner
and
then
came
and
placed
his
feet
on
the
fender
to
do
this
he
had
to
crowd
between
the
two
men
already
occupying
the
best
part
of
the
hearth
but
he
showed
no
concern
at
incommoding
them
and
bore
their
cross
looks
and
threatening
gestures
with
professional
equanimity
you
know
me
he
now
unexpectedly
snapped
bestowing
another
look
over
his
shoulder
at
that
oppressive
figure
in
the
chair
did
i
say
that
i
had
risen
when
the
latter
sat
i
no
westonhaugh
i
nor
yet
a
witherspoon
nor
a
clapsaddle
i
only
smead
the
lawyer
anthony
westonhaugh
lawyer
he
repeated
with
another
glance
of
recognition
in
the
direction
of
the
picture
i
drew
up
his
last
will
and
testament
and
until
all
of
his
wishes
have
been
duly
carried
out
am
entitled
by
the
terms
of
that
will
to
be
regarded
both
legally
and
socially
as
his
representative
this
you
all
know
but
it
is
my
way
to
make
everything
clear
as
i
proceed
a
lawyer
trick
no
doubt
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
entirely
exempt
from
such
a
grumble
from
the
large
man
who
seemed
to
have
been
disturbed
in
some
absorbing
calculation
he
was
carrying
on
mingled
with
a
few
muttered
words
of
forced
acknowledgment
from
the
restless
old
sinner
in
the
chair
made
it
unnecessary
for
me
to
reply
even
if
the
last
comer
had
given
me
the
opportunity
it
getting
late
he
cried
with
an
easy
garrulity
rather
amusing
under
the
circumstances
two
more
trains
came
in
as
i
left
the
depot
if
old
phil
was
on
hand
with
his
wagon
several
more
members
of
this
interesting
family
may
be
here
before
the
clock
strikes
if
not
the
assemblage
is
like
to
be
small
too
small
i
heard
him
grumble
a
minute
after
under
his
breath
i
wish
it
were
a
matter
of
one
spoke
up
the
big
man
striking
his
breast
in
a
way
to
make
it
perfectly
apparent
whom
he
meant
by
that
word
and
having
if
i
may
judge
by
the
mingled
laugh
and
growl
of
his
companions
thus
shown
his
hand
both
figuratively
and
literally
he
relapsed
into
the
calculation
which
seemed
to
absorb
all
of
his
unoccupied
moments
generous
very
commented
the
lawyer
in
a
murmur
which
was
more
than
audible
pity
that
sentiments
of
such
broad
benevolence
should
go
unrewarded
this
because
at
that
very
instant
wheels
were
heard
in
front
also
a
jangle
of
voices
in
some
controversy
about
fares
which
promised
anything
but
a
pleasing
addition
to
the
already
none
too
desirable
company
i
suppose
that
sister
janet
snarled
out
the
one
addressed
as
hector
there
was
no
love
in
his
voice
despite
the
relationship
hinted
at
and
i
awaited
the
entrance
of
this
woman
with
some
curiosity
but
her
appearance
heralded
by
many
a
puff
and
pant
which
the
damp
air
exaggerated
in
a
prodigious
way
did
not
seem
to
warrant
the
interest
i
had
shown
in
it
as
she
stepped
into
the
room
i
saw
only
a
big
frowsy
woman
who
had
attempted
to
make
a
show
with
a
new
silk
dress
and
a
hat
in
the
latest
fashion
but
who
had
lamentably
failed
owing
to
the
slouchiness
of
her
figure
and
some
misadventure
by
which
her
hat
had
been
set
awry
on
her
head
and
her
usual
complacency
destroyed
later
i
noted
that
her
eyes
had
a
false
twinkle
in
them
and
that
commonplace
as
she
looked
she
was
one
to
steer
clear
of
in
times
of
necessity
and
distress
she
too
evidently
expected
to
find
the
door
open
and
people
assembled
but
she
had
not
anticipated
being
confronted
by
the
portrait
on
the
wall
and
cringed
in
an
unpleasant
way
as
she
stumbled
by
it
into
one
of
the
corners
the
old
man
who
had
doubtless
caught
the
rustle
of
her
dress
as
she
passed
him
emitted
one
short
sentence
almost
late
said
he
her
answer
was
a
sputter
of
words
it
the
fault
of
that
driver
she
complained
if
he
had
taken
one
drop
more
at
the
house
i
might
really
not
have
got
here
at
all
that
would
not
have
inconvenienced
but
oh
what
a
grudge
i
would
have
owed
that
skinflint
brother
of
ours
here
she
shook
her
fist
at
the
picture
for
making
our
good
luck
depend
upon
our
arrival
within
two
short
strokes
of
the
clock
there
are
several
to
come
yet
blandly
observed
the
lawyer
but
before
the
words
were
well
out
of
his
mouth
we
all
became
aware
of
a
new
presence
a
woman
whose
somber
grace
and
quiet
bearing
gave
distinction
to
her
unobtrusive
entrance
and
caused
a
feeling
of
something
like
awe
to
follow
the
first
sight
of
her
cold
features
and
deep
eyes
but
this
soon
passed
in
the
more
human
sentiment
awakened
by
the
soft
pleading
which
infused
her
gaze
with
a
touching
femininity
she
wore
a
long
loose
garment
which
fell
without
a
fold
from
chin
to
foot
and
in
her
arms
she
seemed
to
carry
something
never
before
had
i
seen
so
beautiful
a
woman
as
i
was
contemplating
her
with
respect
but
yet
with
a
masculine
intentness
i
could
not
quite
suppress
two
or
three
other
persons
came
in
and
now
i
began
to
notice
that
the
eyes
of
all
these
people
turned
mainly
one
way
and
that
was
toward
the
clock
another
small
circumstance
likewise
drew
my
attention
whenever
any
one
entered
and
there
were
one
or
two
additional
arrivals
during
the
five
minutes
preceding
the
striking
of
the
hour
a
frown
settled
for
an
instant
on
every
brow
giving
to
each
and
all
a
similar
look
for
the
interpretation
of
which
i
lacked
the
key
yet
not
on
every
brow
either
there
was
one
which
remained
undisturbed
and
showed
only
a
grand
patience
as
the
hands
of
the
big
clock
neared
the
point
of
eight
a
furtive
smile
appeared
on
more
than
one
face
and
when
the
hour
rang
out
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
swept
through
the
room
to
which
the
little
old
lawyer
responded
with
a
grunt
as
he
moved
from
his
place
and
proceeded
to
the
door
this
he
had
scarcely
shut
when
a
chorus
of
voices
rose
from
without
three
or
four
lingerers
had
pushed
their
way
as
far
as
the
gate
only
to
see
the
door
of
the
house
shut
in
their
faces
too
late
growled
old
man
luke
from
between
the
locks
of
his
long
beard
too
late
shrieked
the
woman
who
had
come
so
near
being
late
herself
too
late
smoothly
acquiesced
the
lawyer
locking
and
bolting
the
door
with
a
deft
and
assured
hand
but
the
four
or
five
persons
who
thus
found
themselves
barred
out
did
not
accept
without
a
struggle
the
decision
of
the
more
fortunate
ones
assembled
within
more
than
one
hand
began
pounding
on
the
door
and
we
could
hear
cries
of
the
train
was
behind
time
your
clock
is
fast
you
are
cheating
us
you
want
it
all
for
yourselves
we
will
have
the
law
on
you
and
other
bitter
adjurations
unintelligible
to
me
from
my
ignorance
of
the
circumstances
which
called
them
forth
but
the
wary
old
lawyer
simply
shook
his
head
and
answered
nothing
whereat
a
murmur
of
gratification
rose
from
within
and
a
howl
of
almost
frenzied
dismay
from
without
which
latter
presently
received
point
from
a
startling
vision
which
now
appeared
at
the
casement
where
the
lights
burned
a
man
face
looked
in
and
behind
it
that
of
a
woman
so
wild
and
maddened
by
some
sort
of
that
i
found
my
sympathies
aroused
in
spite
of
the
glare
of
evil
passions
which
made
both
of
these
countenances
something
less
than
human
but
the
lawyer
met
the
stare
of
these
four
eyes
with
a
quiet
chuckle
which
found
its
echo
in
the
mirth
of
those
about
him
and
moving
over
to
the
window
where
they
still
peered
in
he
drew
together
the
two
heavy
shutters
which
hitherto
had
stood
back
against
the
wall
and
fastening
them
with
a
bar
shut
out
the
sight
of
this
despair
if
he
could
not
shut
out
the
protests
which
ever
and
anon
were
shouted
through
the
keyhole
meanwhile
one
form
had
sat
through
this
whole
incident
without
a
gesture
and
on
the
quiet
brow
from
which
i
could
not
keep
my
eyes
no
shadows
appeared
save
the
perpetual
one
of
native
melancholy
which
was
at
once
the
source
of
its
attraction
and
the
secret
of
its
power
into
what
sort
of
gathering
had
i
stumbled
and
why
did
i
prefer
to
await
developments
rather
than
ask
the
simplest
question
of
any
one
about
me
meantime
the
lawyer
had
proceeded
to
make
certain
preparations
with
the
help
of
one
or
two
willing
hands
he
had
drawn
the
great
table
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
having
seen
the
candles
restored
to
their
places
began
to
open
his
small
bag
and
take
from
it
a
roll
of
paper
and
several
flat
documents
laying
the
latter
in
the
center
of
the
table
and
slowly
unrolling
the
former
he
consulted
with
his
foxy
eyes
the
faces
surrounding
him
and
smiled
with
secret
malevolence
as
he
noted
that
every
chair
and
every
form
were
turned
away
from
the
picture
before
which
he
had
bent
with
such
obvious
courtesy
on
entering
i
alone
stood
erect
and
this
possibly
was
why
a
gleam
of
curiosity
was
noticeable
in
his
glance
as
he
ended
his
scrutiny
of
my
countenance
and
bent
his
gaze
again
upon
the
paper
he
held
heavens
thought
i
what
shall
i
answer
this
man
if
he
asks
me
why
i
continued
to
remain
in
a
spot
where
i
have
so
little
business
the
impulse
came
to
go
but
such
was
the
effect
of
this
strange
convocation
of
persons
at
night
and
in
a
mist
which
was
itself
a
nightmare
that
i
failed
to
take
action
and
remained
riveted
to
my
place
while
smead
consulted
his
roll
and
finally
asked
in
a
tone
quite
unlike
his
previous
sarcastic
speech
the
names
of
those
whom
he
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
before
him
the
old
man
in
the
chair
spoke
up
first
luke
westonhaugh
he
announced
very
good
responded
the
lawyer
hector
westonhaugh
came
from
the
thin
man
a
nod
and
a
look
toward
the
next
john
westonhaugh
nephew
asked
the
lawyer
yes
go
on
and
be
quick
supper
will
be
ready
at
nine
eunice
westonhaugh
spoke
up
a
soft
voice
i
felt
my
heart
bound
as
if
some
inner
echo
responded
to
that
name
daughter
of
whom
hudson
westonhaugh
she
gently
faltered
my
father
is
dead
died
last
night
i
am
his
only
heir
a
grumble
of
dissatisfaction
and
a
glint
of
unrelieved
hate
came
from
the
figure
whose
malevolence
had
so
revolted
me
but
the
lawyer
was
not
to
be
shaken
very
good
it
is
fortunate
you
trusted
your
feet
rather
than
the
train
and
now
you
what
is
your
name
he
was
looking
not
at
me
as
i
had
at
first
feared
but
at
the
man
next
to
me
a
slim
but
slippery
youth
whose
small
red
eyes
made
me
shudder
william
witherspoon
barbara
son
yes
where
are
your
brothers
one
of
them
i
think
is
outside
here
he
laughed
the
other
is
the
way
he
uttered
this
word
made
me
set
him
down
as
one
to
be
especially
wary
of
when
he
smiled
but
then
i
had
already
passed
judgment
on
him
at
my
first
view
and
you
madam
this
to
the
large
dowdy
woman
with
the
uncertain
eye
a
contrast
to
the
young
and
melancholy
eunice
janet
clapsaddle
she
replied
waddling
hungrily
forward
and
getting
unpleasantly
near
the
speaker
for
he
moved
off
as
she
approached
and
took
his
stand
in
the
clear
place
at
the
head
of
the
table
very
good
mistress
clapsaddle
you
were
a
westonhaugh
i
believe
you
hypocrite
that
you
are
she
blurted
out
i
do
understand
your
lawyer
ways
i
like
plain
speaking
myself
you
know
me
and
luke
and
hector
and
and
most
of
us
indeed
except
that
puny
girl
yonder
whom
having
been
brought
up
on
the
other
side
of
the
ridge
we
have
none
of
us
seen
since
she
was
a
screaming
baby
in
hildegarde
arms
and
the
young
gentleman
over
there
here
she
indicated
me
who
shows
so
little
likeness
to
the
rest
of
the
family
he
will
have
to
make
it
pretty
plain
who
his
father
was
before
we
shall
feel
like
acknowledging
him
either
as
the
son
of
one
of
eustace
girls
or
a
chip
from
brother
salmon
hard
old
block
as
this
caused
all
eyes
to
turn
upon
me
even
i
smiled
as
i
stepped
forward
the
lawyer
did
not
return
that
smile
what
is
your
name
he
asked
shortly
and
sharply
as
if
he
distrusted
me
hugh
austin
was
my
quiet
reply
there
is
no
such
name
on
the
list
snapped
old
smead
with
an
authoritative
gesture
toward
those
who
seemed
anxious
to
enter
a
protest
probably
not
i
returned
for
i
am
neither
a
witherspoon
a
westonhaugh
nor
a
clapsaddle
i
am
merely
a
chance
wayfarer
passing
through
the
town
on
my
way
west
i
thought
this
house
was
a
tavern
or
at
least
a
place
i
could
lodge
in
the
man
i
met
in
the
doorway
told
me
as
much
and
so
i
am
here
if
my
company
is
not
agreeable
or
if
you
wish
this
room
to
yourselves
let
me
go
into
the
kitchen
i
promise
not
to
meddle
with
the
supper
hungry
as
i
am
or
perhaps
you
wish
me
to
join
the
crowd
outside
it
seems
to
be
increasing
no
no
came
from
all
parts
of
the
room
do
let
the
door
be
opened
nothing
could
keep
lemuel
and
his
crowd
out
if
they
once
got
foot
over
the
threshold
the
lawyer
rubbed
his
chin
he
seemed
to
be
in
some
sort
of
quandary
first
he
scrutinized
me
from
under
his
shaggy
brows
with
a
sharp
gleam
of
suspicion
then
his
features
softened
and
with
a
side
glance
at
the
young
woman
who
called
herself
eunice
perhaps
because
she
was
worth
looking
at
perhaps
because
she
had
partly
risen
at
my
words
he
slipped
toward
a
door
i
had
before
observed
in
the
wainscoting
on
the
left
of
the
mantelpiece
and
softly
opened
it
upon
what
looked
like
a
narrow
staircase
we
can
not
let
you
go
out
said
he
and
we
can
not
let
you
have
a
finger
in
our
viands
before
the
hour
comes
for
serving
them
so
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
follow
this
staircase
to
the
top
you
will
find
it
ends
in
a
room
comfortable
enough
for
the
wayfarer
you
call
yourself
in
that
room
you
can
rest
till
the
way
is
clear
for
you
to
continue
your
travels
better
we
can
not
do
for
you
this
house
is
not
a
tavern
but
the
somewhat
valuable
property
of
he
turned
with
a
bow
and
smile
as
every
one
there
drew
a
deep
breath
but
no
one
ventured
to
end
that
sentence
i
would
have
given
all
my
future
prospects
which
by
the
way
were
not
very
great
to
remain
in
that
room
the
oddity
of
the
situation
the
mystery
of
the
occurrence
the
suspense
i
saw
in
every
face
the
eagerness
of
the
cries
i
heard
redoubled
from
time
to
time
outside
the
malevolence
but
poorly
disguised
in
the
old
lawyer
countenance
and
above
all
the
presence
of
that
woman
which
was
the
one
to
the
general
tone
of
villainy
with
which
the
room
was
charged
filled
me
with
curiosity
if
i
might
call
it
by
no
other
name
that
made
my
acquiescence
in
the
demand
thus
made
upon
me
positively
heroic
but
there
seemed
no
other
course
for
me
to
follow
and
with
a
last
lingering
glance
at
the
genial
fire
and
a
quick
look
about
me
which
happily
encountered
hers
i
stooped
my
head
to
suit
the
low
and
narrow
doorway
opened
for
my
accommodation
and
instantly
found
myself
in
darkness
the
door
had
been
immediately
closed
by
the
lawyer
impatient
hand
ii
with
my
ear
to
the
wainscoting
no
move
more
unwise
could
have
been
made
by
the
old
lawyer
that
is
if
his
intention
had
been
to
rid
himself
of
an
unwelcome
witness
for
finding
myself
thrust
thus
suddenly
from
the
scene
i
naturally
stood
still
instead
of
mounting
the
stairs
and
by
standing
still
discovered
that
though
shut
from
sight
i
was
not
from
sound
distinctly
through
the
panel
of
the
door
which
was
much
thinner
no
doubt
than
the
old
fox
imagined
i
heard
one
of
the
men
present
shout
out
well
that
makes
the
number
less
by
the
murmur
which
followed
this
remark
came
plainly
to
my
ears
and
greatly
rejoicing
over
what
i
considered
my
good
luck
i
settled
myself
on
the
lowest
step
of
the
stairs
in
the
hope
of
catching
some
word
which
would
reveal
to
me
the
mystery
of
this
scene
it
was
not
long
in
coming
old
smead
had
now
his
audience
before
him
in
good
shape
and
his
next
words
were
of
a
character
to
make
evident
the
purpose
of
this
meeting
heirs
of
anthony
westonhaugh
deceased
he
began
in
a
voice
strangely
unmusical
i
congratulate
you
upon
your
good
fortune
at
being
at
this
especial
moment
on
the
inner
rather
than
outer
side
of
your
amiable
relative
front
door
his
will
which
you
have
assembled
to
hear
read
is
well
known
to
you
by
it
his
whole
property
not
so
large
as
some
of
you
might
wish
but
yet
a
goodly
property
for
farmers
like
yourselves
is
to
be
divided
this
night
share
and
share
alike
among
such
of
his
relatives
as
have
found
it
convenient
to
be
present
here
between
the
strokes
of
seven
and
eight
if
some
of
our
friends
have
failed
us
through
sloth
sickness
or
the
misfortune
of
mistaking
the
road
they
have
our
sympathy
but
they
can
not
have
can
not
have
his
dollars
echoed
a
rasping
voice
which
from
its
smothered
sound
probably
came
from
the
bearded
lips
of
the
old
reprobate
in
the
chair
the
lawyer
waited
for
one
or
two
other
repetitions
of
this
phrase
a
phrase
which
for
some
unimaginable
reason
seemed
to
give
him
an
odd
sort
of
pleasure
then
he
went
on
with
greater
distinctness
and
a
certain
sly
emphasis
chilling
in
effect
but
very
professional
ladies
and
gentlemen
shall
i
read
this
will
no
no
the
division
the
division
tell
us
what
we
are
to
have
rose
in
a
shout
about
him
there
was
a
pause
i
could
imagine
the
sharp
eyes
of
the
lawyer
traveling
from
face
to
face
as
each
thus
gave
voice
to
his
cupidity
and
the
thin
curl
of
his
lips
as
he
remarked
in
a
slow
tantalizing
way
there
was
more
in
the
old
man
clutches
than
you
think
a
gasp
of
greed
shook
the
partition
against
which
my
ear
was
pressed
some
one
must
have
drawn
up
against
the
wainscoting
since
my
departure
from
the
room
i
found
myself
wondering
which
of
them
it
was
meantime
old
smead
was
having
his
say
with
the
smoothness
of
a
man
who
perfectly
understands
what
is
required
of
him
westonhaugh
would
not
have
put
you
to
so
much
trouble
or
had
you
wait
so
long
if
he
had
not
expected
to
reward
you
amply
there
are
shares
in
this
bag
which
are
worth
thousands
instead
of
hundreds
now
now
stop
that
hands
off
hands
off
there
are
calculations
to
make
first
how
many
of
you
are
there
count
up
some
of
you
nine
called
out
a
voice
with
such
rapacious
eagerness
that
the
word
was
almost
unintelligible
nine
how
slowly
the
old
knave
spoke
what
pleasure
he
seemed
to
take
in
the
suspense
he
purposely
made
as
exasperating
as
possible
well
if
each
one
gets
his
share
he
may
count
himself
richer
by
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
than
when
he
came
in
here
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
they
had
expected
no
more
than
thirty
surprise
made
them
speechless
that
is
for
a
moment
then
a
pandemonium
of
hurrahs
shrieks
and
enthusiasm
made
the
room
ring
till
wonder
seized
them
again
and
a
sudden
silence
fell
through
which
i
caught
a
wail
of
grief
from
the
disappointed
ones
without
which
heard
in
the
dark
and
narrow
place
in
which
i
was
confined
had
a
peculiarly
weird
and
desolate
effect
perhaps
it
likewise
was
heard
by
some
of
the
fortunate
ones
within
perhaps
one
head
to
mark
which
in
this
moment
of
universal
elation
i
would
have
given
a
year
from
my
life
turned
toward
the
dark
without
in
recognition
of
the
despair
thus
piteously
voiced
but
if
so
no
token
of
the
same
came
to
me
and
i
could
but
hope
that
she
had
shown
by
some
such
movement
the
natural
sympathy
of
her
sex
meanwhile
the
lawyer
was
addressing
the
company
in
his
smoothest
and
most
sarcastic
tones
westonhaugh
was
a
wise
man
a
very
wise
man
he
droned
he
foresaw
what
your
pleasure
would
be
and
left
a
letter
for
you
but
before
i
read
it
before
i
invite
you
to
the
board
he
ordered
to
be
spread
for
you
in
honor
of
this
happy
occasion
there
is
one
appeal
he
bade
me
make
to
those
i
should
find
assembled
here
as
you
know
he
was
not
personally
acquainted
with
all
the
children
and
grandchildren
of
his
many
brothers
and
sisters
salmon
sons
for
instance
were
perfect
strangers
to
him
and
all
those
boys
and
girls
of
the
evans
branch
have
never
been
long
enough
this
side
of
the
mountains
for
him
to
know
their
names
much
less
their
temper
or
their
lives
yet
his
heirs
or
such
was
his
wish
his
great
wish
must
be
honest
men
righteous
in
their
dealings
and
of
stainless
lives
if
therefore
any
one
among
you
feels
that
for
reasons
he
need
not
state
he
has
no
right
to
accept
his
share
of
anthony
westonhaugh
bounty
then
that
person
is
requested
to
withdraw
before
this
letter
to
his
heirs
is
read
withdraw
was
the
man
a
fool
these
cormorants
these
suckers
of
blood
these
harpies
and
vultures
i
laughed
as
i
imagined
sneaking
hector
malicious
luke
or
brutal
john
responding
to
this
naïve
appeal
and
then
found
myself
wondering
why
no
echo
of
my
mirth
came
from
the
men
themselves
they
must
have
seen
much
more
plainly
than
i
did
the
ludicrousness
of
their
weak
old
kinsman
demand
yet
luke
was
still
hector
was
still
and
even
john
and
the
three
or
four
others
i
have
mentioned
gave
forth
no
audible
token
of
disdain
or
surprise
i
was
asking
myself
what
sentiment
of
awe
or
fear
restrained
these
selfish
souls
when
i
became
conscious
of
a
movement
within
which
presently
resolved
itself
into
a
departing
footstep
some
conscience
there
had
been
awakened
some
one
was
crossing
the
floor
toward
the
door
who
i
waited
in
anxious
expectancy
for
the
word
which
was
to
enlighten
me
happily
it
came
soon
and
from
the
old
lips
you
do
not
feel
yourself
worthy
he
queried
in
tones
i
had
not
heard
from
him
before
why
what
have
you
done
that
you
should
forego
an
inheritance
to
which
these
others
feel
themselves
honestly
entitled
the
voice
which
answered
gave
both
my
mind
and
heart
a
shock
it
was
who
had
risen
at
this
call
the
only
person
there
anxiously
i
listened
for
her
reply
alas
it
was
one
of
action
rather
than
speech
as
i
afterward
heard
she
simply
opened
her
long
cloak
and
showed
a
little
infant
slumbering
in
her
arms
this
is
my
reason
said
she
i
have
sinned
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
therefore
i
can
not
take
my
share
of
uncle
anthony
money
i
did
not
know
he
exacted
an
unblemished
record
from
those
he
expected
to
enrich
or
i
would
not
have
come
the
sob
which
followed
these
last
words
showed
at
what
a
cost
she
thus
renounced
a
fortune
of
which
she
of
all
present
perhaps
stood
in
the
greatest
need
but
there
was
no
lingering
in
her
step
and
to
me
who
understood
her
fault
only
through
the
faint
sound
of
infantile
wailing
which
accompanied
her
departure
there
was
a
nobility
in
her
action
which
raised
her
in
an
instant
to
an
almost
ideal
height
of
unselfish
virtue
perhaps
they
felt
this
too
perhaps
even
these
hardened
men
and
the
more
than
hardened
woman
whose
presence
was
in
itself
a
blight
recognized
heroism
when
they
saw
it
for
when
the
lawyer
with
a
certain
obvious
reluctance
laid
his
hand
on
the
bolts
of
the
door
with
the
remark
this
is
not
my
work
you
know
i
am
but
following
out
instructions
very
minutely
given
me
the
smothered
growls
and
grunts
which
rose
in
reply
lacked
the
venom
which
had
been
infused
into
all
their
previous
comments
i
think
our
friends
out
there
are
far
enough
withdrawn
by
this
time
for
us
to
hazard
the
opening
of
the
door
the
lawyer
now
remarked
madam
i
hope
you
will
speedily
find
your
way
to
some
comfortable
shelter
then
the
door
opened
and
after
a
moment
closed
again
in
a
silence
which
at
least
was
respectful
yet
i
warrant
there
was
not
a
soul
remaining
who
had
not
already
figured
in
his
mind
to
what
extent
his
own
fortune
had
been
increased
by
the
failure
of
one
of
their
number
to
inherit
as
for
me
my
whole
interest
in
the
affair
was
at
an
end
and
i
was
only
anxious
to
find
my
way
to
where
this
desolate
woman
faced
the
mist
with
her
unfed
baby
in
her
arms
iii
a
life
drama
but
to
reach
this
wanderer
it
was
first
necessary
for
me
to
escape
from
the
house
this
proved
simple
enough
the
room
toward
which
i
rushed
had
a
window
overlooking
one
of
the
many
already
mentioned
this
window
was
fastened
but
i
had
no
difficulty
in
unlocking
it
or
in
finding
my
way
to
the
ground
from
the
top
of
the
but
once
again
on
i
discovered
that
the
mist
was
now
so
thick
that
it
had
all
the
effect
of
a
fog
at
sea
it
was
icy
cold
as
well
and
clung
about
me
so
that
i
presently
began
to
shudder
most
violently
and
strong
man
though
i
was
wish
myself
back
in
the
little
attic
bedroom
from
which
i
had
climbed
in
search
of
one
in
more
unhappy
case
than
myself
but
these
feelings
did
not
cause
me
to
return
if
i
found
the
night
cold
she
must
find
it
bitter
if
desolation
oppressed
my
naturally
hopeful
spirit
must
it
not
be
more
overwhelming
yet
to
one
whose
memories
were
sad
and
whose
future
was
doubtful
and
the
child
what
infant
could
live
in
an
air
like
this
edging
away
from
the
house
i
called
out
her
name
but
no
answer
came
back
the
persons
whom
we
had
heard
flitting
in
restless
longing
about
the
house
a
few
moments
before
had
left
in
rage
and
she
possibly
with
them
yet
i
could
not
imagine
her
joining
herself
to
people
of
their
stamp
there
had
been
a
solitariness
in
her
aspect
which
seemed
to
forbid
any
such
companionship
whatever
her
story
at
least
she
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
two
persons
whose
faces
i
had
seen
looking
in
at
the
casement
no
i
should
find
her
alone
but
where
certainly
the
ring
of
mist
surrounding
me
at
that
moment
offered
me
little
prospect
of
finding
her
anywhere
either
easily
or
soon
again
i
raised
my
voice
and
again
i
failed
to
meet
with
response
then
fearing
to
leave
the
house
lest
i
should
be
quite
lost
amid
the
fences
and
brush
lying
between
it
and
the
road
i
began
to
feel
my
way
along
the
walls
calling
softly
now
instead
of
loudly
so
anxious
was
i
not
to
miss
any
chance
of
carrying
comfort
if
not
succor
to
the
woman
i
was
seeking
but
the
night
gave
back
no
sound
and
when
i
came
to
the
open
door
of
a
shed
i
welcomed
the
refuge
it
offered
and
stepped
in
i
was
of
course
confronted
by
darkness
a
different
darkness
from
that
without
and
impenetrable
but
when
after
a
moment
of
intense
listening
i
heard
a
soft
sound
as
of
weariful
breathing
i
was
seized
anew
by
hope
and
feeling
in
my
pocket
for
my
i
made
a
light
and
looked
around
my
intuitions
had
not
deceived
me
she
was
there
sitting
on
the
floor
with
her
cheek
pressed
against
the
wall
she
revealed
to
my
eager
scrutiny
only
the
outlines
of
her
pure
pale
profile
but
in
those
outlines
and
on
those
pure
pale
features
i
saw
such
an
abandonment
of
hope
mingled
with
such
quiet
endurance
that
my
whole
soul
melted
before
it
and
it
was
with
difficulty
i
managed
to
say
pardon
i
do
not
wish
to
intrude
but
i
am
shut
out
of
the
house
also
and
the
night
is
raw
and
cold
can
i
do
nothing
for
your
comfort
or
for
for
the
child
she
turned
toward
me
and
i
saw
a
tremulous
gleam
of
pleasure
disturb
the
somber
stillness
of
her
face
then
the
match
went
out
in
my
hand
and
we
were
again
in
complete
darkness
but
the
little
wail
which
at
the
same
instant
rose
from
between
her
arms
filled
up
the
pause
as
her
sweet
hush
filled
my
heart
i
am
used
to
the
cold
came
in
another
moment
from
the
place
where
she
crouched
it
is
the
child
she
is
hungry
and
i
i
walked
here
feeling
hoping
that
as
my
father
heir
i
might
partake
in
some
slight
measure
of
uncle
anthony
money
though
my
father
cast
me
out
before
he
died
and
i
have
neither
home
nor
money
i
do
not
complain
i
forfeited
all
when
another
wail
another
gentle
hush
then
silence
i
lit
another
match
look
in
my
face
i
prayed
i
am
a
stranger
and
you
would
be
showing
only
proper
prudence
not
to
trust
me
but
i
overheard
your
words
when
you
withdrew
from
the
room
where
your
fortune
lay
and
i
honor
you
madam
if
food
can
be
got
for
your
little
one
i
will
get
it
i
caught
sight
of
the
convulsive
clasp
with
which
she
drew
to
her
breast
the
tiny
bundle
she
held
then
darkness
fell
again
a
little
bread
she
entreated
a
little
milk
ah
baby
baby
hush
but
where
can
i
get
it
i
cried
they
are
at
table
inside
i
hear
them
shouting
over
their
good
cheer
but
perhaps
there
are
neighbors
near
by
do
you
know
there
are
no
neighbors
she
replied
what
is
got
must
be
got
here
i
know
a
way
to
the
kitchen
i
used
to
visit
uncle
anthony
when
a
little
child
if
you
have
the
courage
i
laughed
this
token
of
confidence
seemed
to
reassure
her
i
heard
her
move
possibly
she
stood
up
in
the
further
corner
of
this
shed
said
she
there
used
to
be
a
trap
connecting
this
floor
with
an
underground
passageway
a
ladder
stood
against
the
trap
and
the
small
cellar
at
the
foot
communicated
by
means
of
an
door
with
the
large
one
under
the
house
eighteen
years
ago
the
wood
of
that
door
was
old
now
it
should
be
rotten
if
you
have
the
strength
i
will
make
the
effort
and
see
said
i
but
when
i
am
in
the
cellar
what
then
follow
the
wall
to
the
right
you
will
come
to
a
stone
staircase
as
this
staircase
has
no
railing
be
careful
in
ascending
it
at
the
top
you
will
find
a
door
it
leads
into
a
pantry
adjoining
the
kitchen
some
one
will
be
in
that
pantry
some
one
will
give
you
a
bite
for
the
child
and
when
she
is
quieted
and
the
sun
has
risen
i
will
go
away
it
is
my
duty
to
do
so
my
uncle
was
always
upright
if
cold
he
was
perfectly
justified
in
exacting
rectitude
in
his
heirs
i
might
have
rejoined
by
asking
if
she
detected
rectitude
in
the
faces
of
the
greedy
throng
she
had
left
behind
her
with
the
guardian
of
this
estate
but
i
did
not
i
was
too
intent
upon
following
out
her
directions
lighting
another
match
i
sought
the
trap
alas
it
was
burdened
with
a
pile
of
sticks
and
rubbish
which
looked
as
if
they
had
lain
there
for
years
as
these
had
to
be
removed
in
total
darkness
it
took
me
some
time
but
once
this
debris
had
been
scattered
and
thrown
aside
i
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
trap
and
as
the
ladder
was
still
there
i
was
soon
on
the
when
by
the
reassuring
shout
i
gave
she
knew
that
i
had
advanced
thus
far
she
spoke
and
her
voice
had
a
soft
and
thrilling
sound
do
not
forget
your
own
needs
she
said
we
two
are
not
so
hungry
that
we
can
not
wait
for
you
to
take
a
mouthful
i
will
sing
to
the
baby
these
ten
minutes
we
had
spent
together
had
made
us
friends
the
warmth
the
strength
which
this
discovery
brought
gave
to
my
arm
a
force
that
made
that
old
oak
door
go
down
before
me
in
three
vigorous
pushes
had
the
eight
fortunate
ones
above
not
been
indulging
in
a
noisy
celebration
of
their
good
luck
they
must
have
heard
the
clatter
of
this
door
when
it
fell
but
good
eating
good
drink
and
the
prospect
of
an
immediate
fortune
far
beyond
their
wildest
dreams
made
all
ears
deaf
and
no
pause
occurred
in
the
shouts
of
laughter
and
the
hum
of
which
sifted
down
between
the
beams
supporting
the
house
above
my
head
consequently
little
or
no
courage
was
required
for
the
completion
of
my
adventure
and
before
long
i
came
upon
the
staircase
and
the
door
leading
from
its
top
into
the
pantry
the
next
minute
i
was
in
front
of
that
door
but
here
a
surprise
awaited
me
the
noise
which
had
hitherto
been
loud
now
became
deafening
and
i
realized
that
contrary
to
eunice
westonhaugh
expectation
the
supper
had
been
spread
in
the
kitchen
and
that
i
was
likely
to
run
amuck
of
the
whole
despicable
crowd
in
any
effort
i
might
make
to
get
a
bite
for
the
famished
baby
i
therefore
naturally
hesitated
to
push
open
the
door
fearing
to
draw
attention
to
myself
and
when
i
did
succeed
in
lifting
the
latch
and
making
a
small
crack
i
was
so
astonished
by
the
sudden
lull
in
the
general
babble
that
i
drew
hastily
back
and
was
for
descending
the
stairs
in
sudden
retreat
but
i
was
prevented
from
carrying
out
this
cowardly
impulse
by
catching
the
sound
of
the
lawyer
voice
addressing
the
assembled
guests
you
have
eaten
and
you
have
drunk
he
was
saying
you
are
therefore
ready
for
the
final
toast
brothers
nephews
heirs
all
of
anthony
westonhaugh
i
rise
to
propose
the
name
of
your
generous
benefactor
who
if
spirits
walk
this
earth
must
certainly
be
with
us
a
grumble
from
more
than
one
throat
and
an
uneasy
hitch
from
such
shoulders
as
i
could
see
through
my
narrow
testified
to
the
rather
doubtful
pleasure
with
which
this
suggestion
was
received
but
the
lawyer
tones
lost
none
of
their
animation
as
he
went
on
to
say
the
bottle
from
which
your
glasses
are
to
be
replenished
for
this
final
draft
he
has
himself
provided
so
anxious
was
he
that
it
should
be
of
the
very
best
and
altogether
worthy
of
the
occasion
it
is
to
celebrate
that
he
gave
into
my
charge
almost
with
his
dying
breath
this
key
telling
me
that
it
would
unlock
a
cupboard
here
in
which
he
had
placed
a
bottle
of
wine
of
the
very
rarest
vintage
this
is
the
key
and
yonder
if
i
do
not
mistake
is
the
cupboard
they
had
already
quaffed
a
dozen
toasts
perhaps
this
was
why
they
accepted
this
proposition
in
a
sort
of
panting
silence
which
remained
unbroken
while
the
lawyer
crossed
the
floor
unlocked
the
cupboard
and
brought
out
before
them
a
bottle
which
he
held
up
before
their
eyes
with
a
simulated
glee
almost
saturnine
is
that
a
bottle
to
make
your
eyes
dance
the
very
cobwebs
on
it
are
eloquent
and
see
look
at
this
label
tokay
friends
real
tokay
how
many
of
you
ever
had
the
opportunity
of
drinking
real
tokay
before
a
long
deep
sigh
from
a
throats
in
which
some
strong
but
hitherto
repressed
passion
totally
incomprehensible
to
me
found
sudden
vent
rose
in
one
simultaneous
sound
from
about
that
table
and
i
heard
one
jocular
voice
sing
out
pass
it
around
smead
i
drink
to
uncle
anthony
out
of
that
bottle
till
there
is
a
drop
left
to
tell
what
was
in
it
but
the
lawyer
was
in
no
hurry
you
have
forgotten
the
letter
for
the
hearing
of
which
you
are
called
together
anthony
westonhaugh
left
behind
him
a
letter
the
time
is
now
come
for
reading
it
as
i
heard
these
words
and
realized
that
the
final
toast
was
to
be
delayed
and
that
some
few
moments
must
yet
elapse
before
the
room
would
be
cleared
and
an
opportunity
given
me
for
obtaining
what
i
needed
for
the
famishing
mother
and
child
i
felt
such
impatience
with
the
fact
and
so
much
anxiety
as
to
the
condition
of
those
i
had
left
behind
me
that
i
questioned
whether
it
would
not
be
better
for
me
to
return
to
them
than
to
leave
them
so
long
without
the
comfort
of
my
presence
when
the
fascination
of
the
scene
again
seized
me
and
i
found
myself
lingering
to
mark
its
conclusion
with
an
avidity
which
can
only
be
explained
by
my
sudden
and
intense
consciousness
of
what
it
all
might
mean
to
her
whose
witness
i
had
thus
inadvertently
become
the
careful
lawyer
began
by
quoting
the
injunction
with
which
this
letter
had
been
put
in
his
hands
they
are
warm
with
food
and
wine
but
not
too
warm
thus
his
adjuration
ran
let
them
hear
my
first
and
only
words
to
them
i
know
you
are
eager
for
these
words
folk
so
honest
so
convinced
of
their
own
purity
and
uprightness
that
they
can
stand
unmoved
while
the
youngest
and
most
helpless
among
them
withdraws
her
claim
to
wealth
and
independence
rather
than
share
an
unmerited
bounty
such
folk
i
say
must
be
eager
must
be
anxious
to
know
why
they
have
been
made
the
legatees
of
so
great
a
fortune
under
the
easy
conditions
and
amid
such
slight
restrictions
as
have
been
imposed
upon
them
by
their
munificent
kinsman
i
had
rather
go
on
drinking
toasts
babbled
one
thick
voice
i
had
rather
finish
my
figuring
growled
another
in
whose
grating
tones
no
echo
remained
of
hector
westonhaugh
formerly
honeyed
voice
i
am
making
out
a
list
of
stock
blast
your
stock
that
is
if
you
mean
horses
and
cows
screamed
a
third
i
going
in
for
city
life
with
less
money
than
we
have
got
andreas
amsberger
got
to
be
alderman
alderman
sneered
the
whole
pack
and
the
tumult
became
general
if
more
of
us
had
been
sick
called
out
one
or
if
uncle
luke
say
had
tripped
into
the
ditch
instead
of
on
the
edge
of
it
the
fellows
who
came
safe
through
might
have
had
anything
they
wanted
even
to
the
governorship
of
the
state
or
or
silence
came
in
commanding
tones
from
the
lawyer
who
had
begun
to
let
his
disgust
appear
perhaps
because
he
held
under
his
thumb
the
bottle
upon
which
all
eyes
were
now
lovingly
centered
so
lovingly
indeed
that
i
ventured
to
increase
in
the
smallest
perceptible
degree
the
crack
by
means
of
which
i
was
myself
an
interested
if
unseen
participator
in
this
scene
a
sight
of
smead
and
a
partial
glimpse
of
old
luke
covetous
profile
rewarded
this
small
act
of
daring
on
my
part
the
lawyer
was
standing
all
the
rest
were
sitting
perhaps
he
alone
retained
sufficient
steadiness
to
stand
for
i
observed
by
the
control
he
exercised
over
this
herd
of
that
he
alone
had
not
touched
the
cup
which
had
so
freely
gone
about
among
the
others
the
woman
was
hidden
from
me
but
the
change
in
her
voice
when
by
any
chance
i
heard
it
convinced
me
that
she
had
not
disdained
the
toasts
drunk
by
her
brothers
and
nephews
silence
the
lawyer
reiterated
or
i
will
smash
this
bottle
on
the
hearth
he
raised
it
in
one
threatening
hand
and
every
man
there
seemed
to
tremble
while
old
luke
put
out
his
long
fingers
with
an
entreaty
that
ill
became
them
you
want
to
hear
the
letter
old
smead
called
out
i
thought
so
putting
the
bottle
down
again
but
still
keeping
one
hand
upon
it
he
drew
a
folded
paper
from
his
breast
this
said
he
contains
the
final
injunctions
of
anthony
westonhaugh
you
will
listen
all
of
you
listen
till
i
am
done
or
i
will
not
only
smash
this
bottle
before
your
eyes
but
i
will
keep
for
ever
buried
in
my
breast
the
whereabouts
of
certain
drafts
and
bonds
in
which
as
his
heirs
you
possess
the
greatest
interest
nobody
but
myself
knows
where
these
papers
can
be
found
whether
this
was
so
or
whether
the
threat
was
an
empty
one
thrown
out
by
this
subtile
old
schemer
for
the
purpose
of
safeguarding
his
life
from
their
possible
hate
and
impatience
it
answered
his
end
with
these
men
and
secured
him
the
silence
he
demanded
breaking
open
the
seal
of
the
envelope
he
held
he
showed
them
the
folded
sheet
which
it
contained
with
the
remark
i
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
writing
of
this
letter
it
is
in
westonhaugh
own
hand
and
he
was
not
even
so
good
as
to
communicate
to
me
the
nature
of
its
contents
i
was
bidden
to
read
it
to
such
as
should
be
here
assembled
under
the
provisos
mentioned
in
his
will
and
as
you
are
now
in
a
condition
to
listen
i
will
proceed
with
my
task
as
required
this
was
my
time
for
leaving
but
a
certain
brooding
terror
latent
in
the
air
held
me
chained
to
the
spot
listening
with
my
ears
but
receiving
the
full
sense
of
what
was
read
from
the
expression
of
old
luke
face
which
was
probably
more
plainly
visible
to
me
than
to
those
who
sat
beside
him
for
being
bent
almost
into
a
bow
as
i
have
said
his
forehead
came
within
an
inch
of
touching
his
plate
and
one
had
to
look
under
his
arms
as
i
did
to
catch
the
workings
of
his
evil
mouth
as
old
smead
gave
forth
in
his
professional
the
following
words
from
his
departed
client
brothers
nephews
and
heirs
though
the
earth
has
lain
upon
my
breast
a
month
i
am
with
you
here
a
snort
from
old
luke
snarling
lips
and
a
stir
not
a
comfortable
one
in
the
jostling
crowd
whose
shaking
arms
and
clawing
hands
i
could
see
projecting
here
and
there
over
the
board
my
presence
at
this
feast
a
presence
which
if
unseen
can
not
be
unfelt
may
bring
you
more
pain
than
pleasure
but
if
so
it
matters
little
you
are
my
natural
heirs
and
i
have
left
you
my
money
why
when
so
little
love
has
characterized
our
intercourse
must
be
evident
to
such
of
my
brothers
as
can
recall
their
youth
and
the
promise
our
father
exacted
from
us
on
the
day
we
set
foot
in
this
new
land
there
were
nine
of
us
in
those
days
luke
salmon
barbara
hector
eustace
janet
hudson
william
and
myself
and
all
save
one
were
promising
in
appearance
at
least
but
our
father
knew
his
offspring
and
when
we
stood
an
alien
and
miserable
band
in
front
of
castle
garden
at
the
foot
of
the
great
city
whose
immensity
struck
terror
to
our
hearts
he
drew
all
our
hands
together
and
made
us
swear
by
the
soul
of
our
mother
whose
body
we
had
left
in
the
sea
that
we
would
keep
the
bond
of
brotherhood
intact
and
share
with
mutual
confidence
whatever
good
fortune
this
untried
country
might
hold
in
store
for
us
you
were
strong
and
your
voices
rang
out
loudly
mine
was
faint
for
i
was
weak
so
weak
that
my
hand
had
to
be
held
in
place
by
my
sister
barbara
but
my
oath
has
never
lost
its
hold
upon
my
heart
while
yours
answer
how
you
have
kept
it
luke
or
you
janet
or
you
hector
of
the
smooth
tongue
and
vicious
heart
or
you
or
you
who
from
one
stock
recognize
but
one
law
the
law
of
selfishness
which
seeks
its
own
in
face
of
all
oaths
and
at
the
cost
of
another
man
this
i
say
to
such
as
know
my
story
but
lest
there
be
one
amongst
you
who
has
not
heard
from
parent
or
uncle
the
true
tale
of
him
who
has
brought
you
all
under
one
roof
i
will
repeat
it
here
in
words
that
no
man
may
fail
to
understand
why
i
remembered
my
oath
through
life
and
beyond
death
yet
stand
above
you
an
accusing
spirit
while
you
quaff
me
toasts
and
count
the
gains
my
justice
divides
among
you
i
as
you
all
remember
was
the
weak
one
the
when
all
of
you
were
grown
and
had
homes
of
your
own
i
still
remained
under
the
family
fed
by
our
father
bounty
and
looking
to
our
justice
for
that
share
of
his
savings
which
he
had
promised
to
all
alike
when
he
died
it
came
to
me
as
it
came
to
you
but
i
had
married
before
that
day
married
not
like
the
rest
of
you
for
what
a
wife
could
bring
but
for
sentiment
and
true
passion
this
in
my
case
meant
a
loving
wife
but
a
frail
one
and
while
we
lived
a
little
while
on
the
patrimony
left
us
it
was
far
too
small
to
support
us
long
without
some
aid
from
our
own
hands
and
our
hands
were
feeble
and
could
not
work
and
so
we
fell
into
debt
for
rent
and
ere
long
for
the
commonest
necessities
of
life
in
vain
i
struggled
to
redeem
myself
the
time
of
my
prosperity
had
not
come
and
i
only
sank
deeper
and
deeper
into
debt
and
finally
into
indigence
a
baby
came
our
landlord
was
kind
and
allowed
us
to
stay
for
two
weeks
under
the
roof
for
whose
protection
we
could
not
pay
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
we
were
asked
to
leave
and
i
found
myself
on
the
road
with
a
dying
wife
a
wailing
infant
no
money
in
my
purse
and
no
power
in
my
arm
to
earn
any
then
when
heart
and
hope
were
both
failing
i
recalled
that
ancient
oath
and
the
six
prosperous
homes
scattered
up
and
down
the
very
highway
on
which
i
stood
i
could
not
leave
my
wife
the
fever
was
in
her
veins
and
she
could
not
bear
me
out
of
her
sight
so
i
put
her
on
a
horse
which
a
kind
old
neighbor
was
willing
to
lend
me
and
holding
her
up
with
one
hand
guided
the
horse
with
the
other
to
the
home
of
my
brother
luke
he
was
a
straight
enough
fellow
in
those
days
physically
i
mean
and
he
looked
able
and
strong
that
morning
as
he
stood
in
the
open
doorway
of
his
house
gazing
down
at
us
as
we
halted
before
him
in
the
roadway
but
his
temper
had
grown
greedy
with
the
accumulation
of
a
few
dollars
and
he
shook
his
head
as
he
closed
his
door
saying
he
remembered
no
oath
and
that
spenders
must
expect
to
be
beggars
struck
to
the
heart
by
a
rebuff
which
meant
prolongation
of
the
suffering
i
saw
in
my
dear
wife
eyes
i
stretched
up
and
kissed
her
where
she
sat
on
the
horse
then
i
moved
on
i
came
to
barbara
home
next
she
had
been
a
little
mother
to
me
once
that
is
she
had
fed
and
dressed
me
and
doled
out
blows
and
caresses
and
taught
me
to
read
and
sing
but
barbara
in
her
father
home
and
without
fortune
was
not
the
barbara
i
saw
on
the
threshold
of
the
little
cottage
she
called
her
own
she
heard
my
story
looked
in
the
face
of
my
wife
and
turned
her
back
she
had
no
place
for
idle
folk
in
her
little
house
if
we
would
work
she
would
feed
us
but
we
must
earn
our
supper
or
go
hungry
to
bed
i
felt
the
trembling
of
my
wife
frame
where
she
leaned
against
my
arm
and
kissing
her
again
led
her
on
to
salmon
luke
hector
janet
have
you
heard
him
tell
of
that
vision
at
his
gateway
years
ago
he
is
not
amongst
you
for
twelve
years
he
has
lain
beside
our
father
in
the
churchyard
but
his
sons
may
be
here
for
they
were
ever
alert
when
gold
was
in
sight
or
a
full
glass
to
be
drained
ask
ask
john
whom
i
saw
skulking
behind
his
cousins
at
the
garden
fence
that
day
what
it
was
they
saw
as
i
drew
rein
under
the
great
tree
which
shadowed
their
father
doorstep
the
sunshine
had
been
pitiless
that
morning
and
the
head
for
whose
rest
in
some
loving
shelter
i
would
have
bartered
soul
and
body
had
fallen
sidewise
till
it
lay
on
my
arm
pressed
to
her
breast
was
our
infant
whose
little
wail
struck
in
pitifully
as
salmon
called
out
to
do
here
do
you
remember
it
lads
or
how
you
all
laughed
little
and
great
when
i
asked
for
a
few
weeks
stay
under
my
brother
roof
till
we
could
all
get
well
and
go
about
our
tasks
again
remember
i
who
am
writing
these
words
from
the
very
mouth
of
the
tomb
remember
but
i
did
not
curse
you
i
only
rode
on
to
the
next
the
way
ran
uphill
now
and
the
sun
which
since
our
last
stop
had
been
under
a
cloud
came
out
and
blistered
my
wife
cheeks
already
burning
red
with
fever
but
i
pressed
my
lips
upon
them
and
led
her
on
with
each
rebuff
i
gave
her
a
kiss
and
her
smile
as
her
head
pressed
harder
and
harder
upon
my
arm
now
exerting
all
its
strength
to
support
her
grew
almost
divine
but
it
vanished
at
my
nephew
lemuel
he
was
shearing
sheep
and
could
give
no
time
to
company
and
when
late
in
the
day
i
drew
rein
at
janet
and
she
said
she
was
going
to
have
a
dance
and
could
not
look
after
sick
folk
the
pallid
lips
failed
to
return
my
despairing
embrace
and
in
the
terror
which
this
brought
me
i
went
down
in
the
gathering
twilight
into
the
deep
valley
where
william
raised
his
sheep
and
reckoned
day
by
day
the
increase
among
his
pigs
oh
the
chill
of
that
descent
oh
the
gloom
of
the
gathering
shadows
as
we
neared
the
bottom
and
i
heard
a
voice
shout
out
a
hoarse
command
some
instinct
made
me
reach
up
for
the
last
time
and
bestow
that
faithful
kiss
which
was
at
once
her
consolation
and
my
prayer
my
lips
were
cold
with
the
terror
of
my
soul
but
they
were
not
so
cold
as
the
cheek
they
touched
and
shrieking
in
my
misery
and
need
i
fell
before
william
where
he
halted
by
the
and
he
was
always
a
hard
man
was
william
and
it
was
a
shock
to
him
no
doubt
to
see
us
standing
in
our
anguish
and
necessity
before
him
but
he
raised
the
whip
in
his
hand
and
when
it
fell
my
arm
fell
with
it
and
she
slipped
from
my
grasp
to
the
ground
and
lay
in
a
heap
in
the
roadway
he
was
ashamed
next
minute
and
pointed
to
the
house
but
i
did
not
carry
her
in
and
she
died
in
the
roadway
do
you
remember
it
luke
do
you
remember
it
lemuel
but
it
is
not
of
this
i
complain
at
this
hour
nor
is
it
for
this
i
ask
you
to
drink
the
toast
i
have
prepared
for
you
the
looks
the
writhings
of
old
luke
and
such
others
as
i
could
now
see
through
the
widening
crack
my
hands
unconsciously
made
in
the
doorway
told
me
that
the
rack
was
at
work
in
this
room
so
lately
given
up
to
revelry
yet
the
mutterings
which
from
time
to
time
came
to
my
ears
from
one
sullen
lip
or
another
did
not
rise
into
frightened
imprecation
or
even
into
any
assertion
of
sorrow
or
contrition
it
seemed
as
if
some
suspense
common
to
all
held
them
speechless
if
not
dumbly
apprehensive
and
while
the
lawyer
said
nothing
in
recognition
of
this
he
could
not
have
been
quite
blind
to
it
for
he
bestowed
one
curious
glance
around
the
table
before
he
proceeded
with
old
anthony
words
those
words
had
now
become
short
sharp
and
accusatory
my
child
lived
and
what
remained
to
me
of
human
passion
and
longing
centered
in
his
frail
existence
i
managed
to
earn
enough
for
his
eating
and
housing
and
in
time
i
was
almost
happy
again
this
was
while
our
existence
was
a
struggle
but
when
with
the
discovery
of
latent
powers
in
my
own
mind
i
began
to
find
my
place
in
the
world
and
to
earn
money
then
your
sudden
interest
in
my
boy
taught
me
a
new
lesson
in
human
selfishness
but
not
as
yet
new
fears
my
nature
was
not
one
to
grasp
ideas
of
evil
and
the
remembrance
of
that
oath
still
remained
to
make
me
lenient
toward
you
i
let
him
see
you
not
much
not
often
but
yet
often
enough
for
him
to
realize
that
he
had
uncles
and
cousins
or
if
you
like
it
better
kindred
and
how
did
you
repay
this
confidence
on
my
part
what
hand
had
ye
in
the
removal
of
this
small
barrier
to
the
fortune
my
own
poor
health
warranted
you
in
looking
upon
even
in
those
early
days
as
your
own
to
others
eyes
it
may
appear
none
to
mine
ye
are
one
and
all
his
murderers
as
certainly
as
all
of
you
were
the
murderers
of
the
good
physician
hastening
to
his
aid
for
his
illness
was
not
a
mortal
one
he
would
have
been
saved
if
the
doctor
had
reached
him
but
a
precipice
swallowed
that
good
samaritan
and
only
i
of
all
who
looked
upon
the
footprints
which
harrowed
up
the
road
at
this
dangerous
point
knew
whose
shoes
would
fit
those
marks
god
providence
it
was
called
and
i
let
it
pass
for
such
but
it
was
a
providence
which
cost
me
my
boy
and
made
my
heirs
silence
as
sullen
in
character
as
the
men
who
found
themselves
thus
openly
impeached
had
for
some
minutes
now
replaced
the
muttered
complaints
which
had
accompanied
the
first
portion
of
this
denunciatory
letter
as
the
lawyer
stopped
to
cast
them
another
of
those
strange
looks
a
gleam
from
old
luke
sidewise
eyes
startled
the
man
next
him
who
shrugging
a
shoulder
passed
the
underhanded
look
on
till
it
had
circled
the
board
and
stopped
with
the
man
sitting
opposite
the
crooked
sinner
who
had
started
it
i
began
to
have
a
wholesome
dread
of
them
all
and
was
astonished
to
see
the
lawyer
drop
his
hand
from
the
bottle
which
to
some
degree
offered
itself
as
a
possible
weapon
but
he
knew
his
audience
better
than
i
did
though
the
bottle
was
now
free
for
any
man
taking
not
a
hand
trembled
toward
it
nor
was
a
single
glass
held
out
the
lawyer
with
an
evil
smile
went
on
with
his
relentless
story
ye
had
killed
my
wife
ye
had
killed
my
son
but
this
was
not
enough
being
lonesome
in
my
great
house
which
was
as
much
too
large
for
me
as
my
fortune
was
i
had
taken
a
child
to
replace
the
boy
i
had
lost
remembering
the
cold
blood
running
in
the
veins
of
those
nearest
me
i
chose
a
boy
from
alien
stock
and
for
a
while
knew
contentment
again
but
as
he
developed
and
my
affections
strengthened
the
possibility
of
all
my
money
going
his
way
roused
my
brothers
and
sisters
from
the
complacency
they
had
enjoyed
since
their
road
to
fortune
had
been
secured
by
my
son
death
and
one
day
can
you
recall
it
hudson
can
you
recall
it
lemuel
the
boy
was
brought
in
from
the
mill
and
laid
at
my
feet
dead
he
had
stumbled
amongst
the
great
belts
but
whose
was
the
voice
which
had
startled
him
with
a
sudden
can
you
say
luke
can
you
say
john
i
can
say
in
whose
ear
it
was
whispered
that
three
if
not
more
of
you
were
seen
moving
among
the
machinery
that
fatal
morning
again
god
providence
was
said
to
have
visited
my
house
and
again
were
my
heirs
stop
there
broke
in
the
harsh
voice
of
luke
who
was
gradually
growing
livid
under
his
long
gray
locks
lies
lies
shrieked
hector
gathering
courage
from
his
brother
cut
it
all
and
give
us
the
drink
snarled
one
of
the
younger
men
who
was
less
under
the
effect
of
liquor
than
the
rest
but
a
trembling
voice
muttered
hush
and
the
lawyer
whose
eye
had
grown
steely
under
these
comments
took
advantage
of
the
sudden
silence
which
had
followed
this
last
objurgation
and
went
steadily
on
some
men
would
have
made
a
will
and
denounced
you
i
made
a
will
but
did
not
denounce
you
am
no
breaker
of
oaths
more
than
this
i
learned
a
new
trick
i
who
hated
all
subtlety
and
looked
upon
craft
as
the
favorite
weapon
of
the
devil
learned
to
smile
with
my
lips
while
my
heart
was
burning
with
hatred
perhaps
this
was
why
you
all
began
to
smile
too
and
joke
me
about
certain
losses
i
had
sustained
by
which
you
meant
the
gains
which
had
come
to
me
that
these
gains
were
many
times
greater
than
you
realized
added
to
the
sting
of
this
good
fellowship
but
i
held
my
peace
and
you
began
to
have
confidence
in
a
which
nothing
could
shake
you
even
gave
me
a
supper
supper
what
was
there
in
these
words
to
cause
every
man
there
to
stop
in
whatever
movement
he
was
making
and
stare
with
eyes
intently
at
the
reader
he
had
spoken
quietly
he
had
not
even
looked
up
but
the
silence
which
for
some
minutes
back
had
begun
to
reign
over
that
tumultuous
gathering
now
became
breathless
and
the
seams
in
cheeks
deepened
to
a
bluish
remember
that
supper
as
the
words
rang
out
again
i
threw
wide
the
door
i
might
have
stalked
openly
into
their
circle
not
a
man
there
would
have
noticed
me
it
was
a
memorable
occasion
the
lawyer
read
on
with
stoical
impassiveness
there
was
not
a
brother
lacking
luke
and
hudson
and
william
and
hector
and
eustace
boys
as
well
as
eustace
himself
janet
too
and
salmon
lemuel
and
barbara
son
who
even
if
his
mother
had
gone
the
way
of
all
flesh
had
so
trained
her
black
brood
in
the
love
of
the
things
of
this
world
that
i
scarcely
missed
her
when
i
looked
about
among
you
all
for
the
eight
sturdy
brothers
and
sisters
who
had
joined
in
one
clasp
and
one
oath
under
the
eye
of
the
immigrant
our
father
what
i
did
miss
was
one
true
eye
lifted
to
my
glance
but
i
did
not
show
that
i
missed
it
and
so
our
peace
was
made
and
we
separated
you
to
wait
for
your
inheritance
and
i
for
the
death
which
was
to
secure
it
to
you
for
when
the
cup
passed
round
that
night
you
each
dropped
into
it
a
tear
of
repentance
and
tears
make
bitter
drinking
i
sickened
as
i
quaffed
and
was
never
myself
again
as
you
know
do
you
understand
me
you
cruel
crafty
ones
did
they
not
heads
quaking
throats
gasping
teeth
chattering
no
longer
sitting
all
risen
all
looking
with
wild
eyes
for
the
door
was
it
not
apparent
that
they
understood
and
only
waited
for
one
more
word
to
break
away
and
flee
the
accursed
house
but
that
word
lingered
old
smead
had
now
grown
pale
himself
and
read
with
difficulty
the
lines
which
were
to
end
this
frightful
scene
as
i
saw
the
red
gleam
of
terror
shine
out
from
his
small
eyes
i
wondered
if
he
had
been
but
the
blind
tool
of
his
implacable
client
and
was
as
ignorant
as
those
before
him
of
what
was
to
follow
this
heavy
arraignment
the
dread
with
which
he
finally
proceeded
was
too
marked
for
me
to
doubt
the
truth
of
this
surmise
this
is
what
he
found
himself
forced
to
read
there
was
a
bottle
reserved
for
me
it
had
a
green
label
on
it
a
shriek
from
every
one
there
and
a
hurried
look
up
and
down
at
the
bottles
standing
on
the
table
a
green
label
the
lawyer
repeated
and
it
made
a
goodly
appearance
as
it
was
set
down
before
me
but
you
had
no
liking
for
wine
with
a
green
label
on
the
bottle
one
by
one
you
refused
it
and
when
i
rose
to
quaff
my
final
glass
alone
every
eye
before
me
fell
and
did
not
lift
again
until
the
glass
was
drained
i
did
not
notice
this
then
but
i
see
it
all
now
just
as
i
hear
again
the
excuses
you
gave
for
not
filling
your
glasses
as
the
bottle
went
round
one
had
drunk
enough
one
suffered
from
qualms
brought
on
by
an
unaccustomed
indulgence
in
oysters
one
felt
that
wine
good
enough
for
me
was
too
good
for
him
and
so
on
and
so
on
not
one
to
show
frank
eyes
and
drink
with
me
as
i
was
ready
to
drink
with
him
why
because
one
and
all
of
you
knew
what
was
in
that
cup
and
would
not
risk
an
inheritance
so
nearly
within
your
grasp
lies
lies
again
shrieked
the
raucous
voice
of
luke
smothered
by
terror
while
oaths
shouts
imprecations
rang
out
in
horrid
tumult
from
one
end
of
the
table
to
the
other
till
the
lawyer
face
over
which
a
startling
change
was
rapidly
passing
drew
the
whole
crowd
forward
again
in
awful
fascination
till
they
clung
speechless
arm
in
arm
shoulder
propping
shoulder
while
he
gasped
out
in
dismay
equal
to
their
own
these
last
fatal
words
that
was
at
your
board
my
brothers
now
you
are
at
mine
you
have
eaten
my
viands
drunk
of
my
cup
and
now
through
the
mouth
of
the
one
man
who
has
been
true
to
me
because
therein
lies
his
advantage
i
offer
you
a
final
glass
will
you
drink
it
i
drank
yours
by
that
oath
which
binds
us
to
share
each
other
fortune
i
ask
you
to
share
this
cup
with
me
will
not
no
no
no
shouted
one
after
another
then
the
inexorable
voice
went
on
a
voice
which
to
these
miserable
souls
was
no
longer
that
of
the
lawyer
but
an
issue
from
the
grave
they
had
themselves
dug
for
anthony
westonhaugh
know
that
your
abstinence
comes
too
late
that
you
have
already
drunk
the
toast
destined
to
end
your
lives
the
bottle
which
you
must
have
missed
from
that
board
of
yours
has
been
offered
you
again
a
label
is
easily
changed
and
luke
john
hector
i
know
you
all
so
well
that
bottle
has
been
greedily
emptied
by
you
and
while
i
who
sipped
sparingly
lived
three
weeks
you
who
have
drunk
deep
not
three
hours
before
you
possibly
not
three
o
the
wail
of
those
lost
souls
as
this
last
sentence
issued
in
a
final
pant
of
horror
from
the
lawyer
quaking
lips
shrieks
howls
prayers
for
mercy
groans
to
make
the
hair
rise
and
curses
at
sound
of
which
i
shut
my
ears
in
horror
only
to
open
them
again
in
dread
as
with
one
simultaneous
impulse
they
flung
themselves
upon
the
lawyer
who
foreseeing
this
rush
had
backed
up
against
the
wall
he
tried
to
stem
the
tide
i
knew
nothing
of
the
poisoning
he
protested
that
was
not
my
reason
for
declining
the
drink
i
wished
to
preserve
my
senses
to
carry
out
my
client
wishes
as
god
lives
i
did
not
know
he
meant
to
carry
his
revenge
so
far
mercy
mer
but
the
hands
which
clutched
him
were
the
hands
of
murderers
and
the
lawyer
puny
figure
could
not
stand
up
against
the
avalanche
of
human
terror
relentless
fury
and
mad
vengeance
which
now
rolled
in
upon
it
as
i
bounded
to
his
relief
he
turned
his
ghastly
face
upon
me
but
the
way
between
us
was
blocked
and
i
was
preparing
myself
to
see
him
sink
before
my
eyes
when
an
unearthly
shriek
rose
from
behind
us
and
every
living
soul
in
that
mass
of
struggling
humanity
paused
set
and
staring
with
stiffened
limbs
and
eyes
fixed
not
on
him
not
on
me
but
on
one
of
their
own
number
the
only
woman
amongst
them
janet
clapsaddle
who
with
clutching
hands
clawing
her
breast
was
reeling
in
solitary
agony
in
her
place
beside
the
board
as
they
looked
she
fell
and
lay
with
upturned
face
and
staring
eyes
in
whose
glassy
depths
the
ones
who
watched
her
could
see
mirrored
their
own
impending
doom
it
was
an
awful
moment
a
groan
in
which
was
concentrated
the
despair
of
seven
miserable
souls
rose
from
that
petrified
band
then
man
by
man
they
separated
and
fell
back
showing
on
each
weak
or
wicked
face
the
particular
passion
which
had
driven
them
into
crime
and
made
them
the
victims
of
this
wholesale
revenge
there
had
been
some
sort
of
bond
between
them
till
the
vision
of
death
rose
before
each
shrinking
soul
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
crime
they
fell
apart
as
their
doom
approached
and
rushing
shrieking
each
man
for
himself
they
one
and
all
sought
to
escape
by
doors
windows
or
any
outlet
which
promised
release
from
this
fatal
spot
one
rushed
by
me
i
do
not
know
which
one
and
i
felt
as
if
a
flame
from
hell
had
licked
me
his
breath
was
so
hot
and
the
moans
he
uttered
so
like
the
curses
we
imagine
to
blister
the
lips
of
the
lost
none
of
them
saw
me
they
did
not
even
detect
the
sliding
form
of
the
lawyer
crawling
away
before
them
to
some
place
of
egress
of
which
they
had
no
knowledge
and
convinced
that
in
this
scene
of
death
i
could
play
no
part
worthy
of
her
who
awaited
me
i
too
rushed
away
and
groping
my
way
back
through
the
cellar
sought
the
side
of
her
who
still
crouched
in
patient
waiting
against
the
dismal
wall
iv
the
final
shock
her
baby
had
fallen
asleep
i
knew
this
by
the
faint
low
sweetness
of
her
croon
and
shuddering
with
the
horrors
i
had
witnessed
horrors
which
acquired
a
double
force
from
the
contrast
presented
by
the
peace
of
this
quiet
spot
and
the
hallowing
influence
of
the
sleeping
infant
i
threw
myself
down
in
the
darkness
at
her
feet
gasping
out
oh
thank
god
and
your
uncle
seeming
harshness
that
you
have
escaped
the
doom
which
has
overtaken
those
others
you
and
your
babe
are
still
alive
while
they
what
of
them
what
has
happened
to
them
you
are
breathless
trembling
you
have
brought
no
bread
no
no
food
in
this
house
means
death
your
relatives
gave
food
and
wine
to
your
uncle
at
a
supper
he
though
now
in
his
grave
has
returned
the
same
to
them
there
was
a
bottle
i
stopped
appalled
a
shriek
muffled
by
distance
but
quivering
with
the
same
note
of
death
i
had
heard
before
had
gone
up
again
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
against
which
we
were
leaning
oh
she
gasped
and
my
father
was
at
that
supper
my
father
who
died
last
night
cursing
the
day
he
was
born
we
are
an
accursed
race
i
have
known
it
all
my
life
perhaps
that
was
why
i
mistook
passion
for
love
and
my
baby
o
god
have
mercy
god
have
mercy
the
plaintiveness
of
that
cry
the
awesomeness
of
what
i
had
seen
of
what
was
going
on
at
that
moment
almost
within
the
reach
of
our
arms
the
darkness
the
desolation
of
our
two
souls
affected
me
as
i
had
never
been
affected
in
my
whole
life
before
in
the
concentrated
experience
of
the
last
two
hours
i
seemed
to
live
years
under
this
woman
eyes
to
know
her
as
i
did
my
own
heart
to
love
her
as
i
did
my
own
soul
no
growth
of
feeling
ever
brought
the
ecstasy
of
that
moment
inspiration
with
no
sense
of
doing
anything
strange
with
no
fear
of
being
misunderstood
i
reached
out
my
hand
and
touching
hers
where
it
lay
clasped
about
her
infant
i
said
we
are
two
poor
wayfarers
a
rough
road
loses
half
its
difficulties
when
trodden
by
two
shall
we
then
fare
on
together
we
and
the
little
child
she
gave
a
sob
there
was
sorrow
longing
grief
hope
in
its
thrilling
low
sound
as
i
recognized
the
latter
emotion
i
drew
her
to
my
breast
the
child
did
not
separate
us
we
shall
be
happy
i
murmured
and
her
sigh
seemed
to
answer
a
delicious
yes
when
suddenly
there
came
a
shock
to
the
partition
against
which
we
leaned
and
starting
from
my
clasp
she
cried
our
duty
is
in
there
shall
we
think
of
ourselves
or
even
of
each
other
while
these
men
all
relatives
of
mine
are
dying
on
the
other
side
of
this
wall
seizing
my
hand
she
dragged
me
to
the
trap
but
here
i
took
the
lead
and
helped
her
down
the
ladder
when
i
had
her
safely
on
the
floor
at
the
foot
she
passed
in
front
of
me
again
but
once
up
the
steps
and
in
front
of
the
kitchen
door
i
thrust
her
behind
me
for
one
glance
into
the
room
beyond
had
convinced
me
it
was
no
place
for
her
but
she
would
not
be
held
back
she
crowded
forward
beside
me
and
together
we
looked
upon
the
wreck
within
it
was
a
scene
the
demon
that
was
in
those
men
had
driven
them
to
demolish
furniture
dishes
everything
in
one
heap
lay
what
an
hour
before
had
been
an
inviting
board
surrounded
by
rollicking
and
greedy
guests
but
it
was
not
upon
this
overthrow
we
stopped
to
look
it
was
upon
something
that
mingled
with
it
dominated
it
and
made
of
this
chaos
only
a
setting
to
awful
death
janet
face
in
all
its
natural
hideousness
and
depravity
looked
up
from
the
floor
beside
this
heap
and
farther
on
the
twisted
figure
of
him
they
called
hector
with
something
more
than
the
seams
of
greedy
longing
round
his
wide
staring
eyes
and
icy
temples
two
in
this
room
and
on
the
threshold
of
the
one
beyond
a
moaning
third
who
sank
into
eternal
silence
as
we
approached
and
before
the
fireplace
in
the
great
room
a
horrible
crescent
that
had
once
been
aged
luke
upon
whom
we
had
no
sooner
turned
our
backs
than
we
caught
glimpses
here
and
there
of
other
prostrate
forms
which
moved
once
under
our
eyes
and
then
moved
no
more
one
only
still
stood
upright
and
he
was
the
man
whose
obtrusive
figure
and
sordid
expression
had
so
revolted
me
in
the
beginning
there
was
no
color
now
in
his
flabby
and
heavily
fallen
cheeks
the
eyes
in
whose
false
sheen
i
had
seen
so
much
of
evil
were
glazed
now
and
his
big
and
burly
frame
shook
the
door
it
pressed
against
he
was
staring
at
a
small
slip
of
paper
he
held
and
from
his
anxious
looks
appeared
to
miss
something
which
neither
of
us
had
power
to
supply
it
was
a
spectacle
to
make
devils
rejoice
and
mortals
fly
aghast
but
eunice
had
a
spirit
like
an
angel
and
drawing
near
him
she
said
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
cousin
john
he
started
looked
at
her
with
the
same
blank
gaze
he
had
hitherto
cast
at
the
wall
then
some
words
formed
on
his
working
lips
and
we
heard
i
can
not
reckon
i
was
never
good
at
figures
but
if
luke
is
gone
and
william
and
hector
and
barbara
boy
and
janet
much
does
that
leave
for
he
was
answered
almost
the
moment
he
spoke
but
it
was
by
other
tongues
and
in
another
world
than
this
as
his
body
fell
forward
i
tore
open
the
door
before
which
he
had
been
standing
and
lifting
the
almost
fainting
eunice
in
my
arms
i
carried
her
out
into
the
night
as
i
did
so
i
caught
a
final
glimpse
of
the
pictured
face
i
had
found
it
so
hard
to
understand
a
couple
of
hours
before
i
understood
it
now
a
surprise
awaited
us
as
we
turned
toward
the
gate
the
mist
had
lifted
and
a
keen
but
not
unpleasant
wind
was
driving
from
the
north
borne
on
it
we
heard
voices
the
village
had
emptied
itself
probably
at
the
alarm
given
by
the
lawyer
and
it
was
these
good
men
and
women
whose
approach
we
heard
as
we
had
nothing
to
fear
from
them
we
went
forward
to
meet
them
as
we
did
so
three
crouching
figures
rose
from
some
bushes
we
passed
and
ran
scurrying
before
us
through
the
gateway
they
were
the
late
comers
who
had
shown
such
despair
at
being
shut
out
from
this
fatal
house
and
who
probably
did
not
yet
know
the
doom
they
had
escaped
there
were
lanterns
in
the
hands
of
some
of
the
men
who
now
approached
as
we
stopped
before
them
these
lanterns
were
held
up
and
by
the
light
they
gave
we
saw
first
the
lawyer
frightened
face
then
the
visages
of
two
men
who
seemed
to
be
persons
of
some
authority
what
news
faltered
the
lawyer
seeing
by
our
faces
that
we
knew
the
worst
bad
i
returned
the
poison
had
lost
none
of
its
virulence
by
being
mixed
so
long
with
the
wine
how
many
asked
the
man
on
his
right
anxiously
eight
was
my
solemn
reply
there
were
but
eight
faltered
the
lawyer
that
means
then
all
all
i
repeated
a
murmur
of
horror
rose
swelled
then
died
out
in
tumult
as
the
crowd
swept
on
past
us
for
a
moment
we
stood
watching
these
people
saw
them
pause
before
the
door
we
had
left
open
behind
us
then
rush
in
leaving
a
wail
of
terror
on
the
shuddering
midnight
air
when
all
was
quiet
again
eunice
laid
her
hand
upon
my
arm
where
shall
we
go
she
asked
despairingly
i
do
not
know
a
house
that
will
open
to
me
the
answer
to
her
question
came
from
other
lips
than
mine
i
do
not
know
one
that
will
spoke
up
a
voice
behind
our
backs
your
withdrawal
from
the
circle
of
heirs
did
not
take
from
you
your
rightful
claim
to
an
inheritance
which
according
to
your
uncle
will
could
be
forfeited
only
by
a
failure
to
arrive
at
the
place
of
distribution
within
the
hour
set
by
the
testator
as
i
see
the
matter
now
this
appeal
to
the
honesty
of
the
persons
so
collected
was
a
test
by
which
my
unhappy
client
strove
to
save
from
the
general
fate
such
members
of
his
miserable
family
as
fully
recognized
their
sin
and
were
truly
repentant
it
was
lawyer
smead
he
had
lingered
behind
the
others
to
tell
her
this
she
was
then
no
outcast
but
rich
very
rich
how
rich
i
dared
not
acknowledge
to
myself
lest
a
remembrance
of
the
man
who
was
the
last
to
perish
in
that
house
of
death
should
return
to
make
this
calculation
hateful
it
was
a
blow
which
struck
deep
deeper
than
any
either
of
us
had
sustained
that
night
as
we
came
to
realize
it
i
stepped
slowly
back
leaving
her
standing
erect
and
tall
in
the
middle
of
the
roadway
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
but
not
for
long
soon
she
was
close
at
my
side
murmuring
softly
two
wayfarers
still
only
the
road
will
be
more
difficult
and
the
need
of
companionship
greater
shall
we
fare
on
together
you
i
and
the
little
one
the
ruby
and
the
caldron
as
there
were
two
good
men
on
duty
that
night
i
did
not
see
why
i
should
remain
at
my
desk
even
though
there
was
an
unusual
stir
created
in
our
small
town
by
the
grand
ball
given
at
the
evergreens
but
just
as
i
was
preparing
to
start
for
home
an
imperative
ring
called
me
to
the
telephone
and
i
heard
halloo
is
this
the
it
is
well
then
a
detective
is
wanted
at
once
at
the
evergreens
he
can
not
be
too
clever
or
too
discreet
a
valuable
jewel
has
been
lost
which
must
be
found
before
the
guests
disperse
for
home
large
reward
if
the
matter
ends
successfully
and
without
too
great
publicity
may
i
ask
who
is
speaking
to
me
mrs
ashley
it
was
the
mistress
of
the
evergreens
and
giver
of
the
ball
madam
a
man
shall
be
sent
at
once
where
will
you
see
him
in
the
butler
pantry
at
the
rear
let
him
give
his
name
as
jennings
very
good
a
pretty
piece
of
work
should
i
send
hendricks
or
should
i
send
hicks
hendricks
was
clever
and
hicks
discreet
but
neither
united
both
qualifications
in
the
measure
demanded
by
the
sensible
and
woman
with
whom
i
had
just
been
talking
what
alternative
remained
but
one
i
must
go
myself
it
was
not
late
not
for
a
ball
night
at
least
and
as
half
the
town
had
been
invited
to
the
dance
the
streets
were
alive
with
carriages
i
was
watching
the
blink
of
their
lights
through
the
fast
falling
snow
when
my
attention
was
drawn
to
a
fact
which
struck
me
as
peculiar
these
carriages
were
all
coming
my
way
instead
of
rolling
in
the
direction
of
the
evergreens
had
they
been
empty
this
would
have
needed
no
explanation
but
as
far
as
i
could
see
most
of
them
were
full
and
that
too
with
loudly
talking
women
and
gesticulating
men
something
of
a
serious
nature
must
have
occurred
at
the
evergreens
rapidly
i
paced
on
and
soon
found
myself
before
the
great
gates
a
crowd
of
vehicles
of
all
descriptions
blocked
the
entrance
none
seemed
to
be
passing
up
the
driveway
all
stood
clustered
at
the
gates
and
as
i
drew
nearer
i
perceived
many
an
anxious
head
thrust
forth
from
their
quickly
opened
doors
and
heard
many
an
ejaculation
of
disappointment
as
the
short
interchange
of
words
went
on
between
the
drivers
of
these
various
turnouts
and
a
man
drawn
up
in
quiet
resolution
before
the
unexpectedly
barred
entrance
slipping
round
to
this
man
side
i
listened
to
what
he
was
saying
it
was
simple
but
very
explicit
ashley
asks
everybody
pardon
but
the
ball
ca
go
on
something
has
happened
which
makes
the
reception
of
further
guests
impossible
evening
she
will
be
happy
to
see
you
all
the
dance
is
simply
postponed
this
he
had
probably
repeated
forty
times
and
each
time
it
had
probably
been
received
with
the
same
mixture
of
doubt
and
curiosity
which
now
held
the
lengthy
procession
in
check
not
wishing
to
attract
attention
yet
anxious
to
lose
no
time
i
pressed
up
still
nearer
and
bending
toward
him
from
the
shadow
cast
by
a
convenient
post
uttered
the
one
word
jennings
instantly
he
unlocked
a
small
gate
at
his
right
i
passed
in
and
with
professional
proceeded
to
take
my
way
to
the
house
through
the
double
row
of
evergreens
bordering
the
semicircular
approach
as
these
trees
stood
very
close
together
and
were
besides
heavily
laden
with
snow
i
failed
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
building
itself
until
i
stood
in
front
of
it
then
i
saw
that
it
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
gave
evidence
here
and
there
of
some
festivity
but
the
guests
were
too
few
for
the
effect
to
be
very
exhilarating
and
passing
around
to
the
rear
i
sought
the
special
entrance
to
which
i
had
been
directed
a
porch
before
which
stood
a
caterer
wagon
led
me
to
a
door
which
had
every
appearance
of
being
the
one
i
sought
pushing
it
open
i
entered
without
ceremony
and
speedily
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
twenty
or
more
colored
waiters
and
chattering
housemaids
to
one
of
the
former
i
addressed
the
question
where
is
the
butler
pantry
i
am
told
that
i
shall
find
the
lady
of
the
house
there
your
name
was
the
curt
demand
jennings
follow
me
i
was
taken
through
narrow
passages
and
across
one
or
two
to
a
small
but
closet
where
i
was
left
with
the
assurance
that
ashley
would
presently
join
me
i
had
never
seen
this
lady
but
i
had
often
heard
her
spoken
of
as
a
woman
of
superior
character
and
admirable
discretion
she
did
not
keep
me
waiting
in
two
minutes
the
door
opened
and
this
fine
woman
was
telling
her
story
in
the
manner
i
so
much
admire
and
so
seldom
meet
with
the
article
lost
was
a
large
ruby
of
singular
beauty
and
great
value
the
property
of
burton
the
senator
wife
in
whose
honor
this
ball
was
given
it
had
not
been
lost
in
the
house
nor
had
it
been
originally
missed
that
evening
burton
and
herself
had
attended
the
great
game
in
the
afternoon
and
it
was
on
the
college
campus
that
burton
had
first
dropped
her
invaluable
jewel
but
a
reward
of
five
hundred
dollars
having
been
at
once
offered
to
whoever
should
find
and
restore
it
a
great
search
had
followed
which
ended
in
its
being
picked
up
by
one
of
the
students
and
brought
back
as
far
as
the
great
step
leading
up
to
the
front
door
when
it
had
again
disappeared
and
in
a
way
to
rouse
conjecture
of
the
strangest
and
most
puzzling
character
the
young
man
who
had
brought
it
thus
far
bore
the
name
of
john
deane
and
was
a
member
of
the
senior
class
he
had
been
the
first
to
detect
its
sparkle
in
the
grass
and
those
who
were
near
enough
to
see
his
face
at
that
happy
moment
say
that
it
expressed
the
utmost
satisfaction
at
his
good
luck
you
see
said
ashley
he
has
a
sweetheart
and
five
hundred
dollars
looks
like
a
fortune
to
a
young
man
just
starting
life
but
he
was
weak
enough
to
take
this
girl
into
his
confidence
and
on
their
way
here
for
both
were
invited
to
the
ball
he
went
so
far
as
to
pull
it
out
of
his
pocket
and
show
it
to
her
they
were
admiring
it
together
and
vaunting
its
beauties
to
the
young
lady
friend
who
had
accompanied
them
when
their
carriage
turned
into
the
driveway
and
they
saw
the
lights
of
the
house
flashing
before
them
hastily
restoring
the
jewel
to
the
little
bag
he
had
made
for
it
out
of
the
of
an
old
glove
a
bag
in
which
he
assured
me
he
had
been
careful
to
keep
it
safely
tied
ever
since
picking
it
up
on
the
college
green
he
thrust
it
back
into
his
pocket
and
prepared
to
help
the
ladies
out
but
just
then
a
disturbance
arose
in
front
a
horse
which
had
been
driven
up
was
rearing
in
a
way
that
threatened
to
overturn
the
light
buggy
to
which
he
was
attached
as
the
occupants
of
this
buggy
were
ladies
and
seemed
to
have
no
control
over
the
plunging
beast
young
deane
naturally
sprang
to
the
rescue
bidding
his
own
ladies
alight
and
make
for
the
porch
he
hurriedly
ran
forward
and
pausing
in
front
of
the
maddened
animal
waited
for
an
opportunity
to
seize
him
by
the
rein
he
says
that
as
he
stood
there
facing
the
beast
with
fixed
eye
and
raised
hand
he
distinctly
felt
something
strike
or
touch
his
breast
but
the
sensation
conveyed
no
meaning
to
him
in
his
excitement
and
he
did
not
think
of
it
again
till
the
horse
well
in
hand
and
the
two
alarmed
occupants
of
the
buggy
rescued
he
turned
to
see
where
his
own
ladies
were
and
beheld
them
looking
down
at
him
from
the
midst
of
a
circle
of
young
people
drawn
from
the
house
by
the
screaming
of
the
women
instantly
a
thought
of
the
treasure
he
carried
recurred
to
his
mind
and
dropping
the
rein
of
the
now
quieted
horse
he
put
his
hand
to
his
pocket
the
jewel
was
gone
he
declares
that
for
a
moment
he
felt
as
if
he
had
been
struck
on
the
head
by
one
of
the
hoofs
of
the
frantic
horse
he
had
just
handled
but
immediately
the
importance
of
his
loss
and
the
necessity
he
felt
for
instant
action
restored
him
to
himself
and
shouting
aloud
have
dropped
burton
ruby
begged
every
one
to
stand
still
while
he
made
a
search
for
it
this
all
occurred
as
you
must
know
more
than
an
hour
and
a
half
ago
consequently
before
many
of
my
guests
had
arrived
my
son
who
was
one
of
the
few
spectators
gathered
on
the
porch
tells
me
that
there
was
only
one
other
carriage
behind
the
one
in
which
deane
had
brought
his
ladies
both
of
these
had
stopped
short
of
the
and
as
the
horse
and
buggy
which
had
made
all
this
trouble
had
by
this
time
been
driven
to
the
stable
nothing
stood
in
the
way
of
his
search
but
the
rapidly
accumulating
snow
which
if
you
remember
was
falling
very
thick
and
fast
at
the
time
my
son
who
had
rushed
in
for
his
overcoat
came
running
down
with
offers
to
help
him
so
did
some
others
but
with
an
imploring
gesture
he
begged
to
be
allowed
to
conduct
the
search
alone
the
ground
being
in
such
a
state
that
the
jewel
ran
great
risk
of
being
trodden
into
the
snow
and
thus
injured
or
lost
they
humored
him
for
a
moment
then
seeing
that
his
efforts
bade
fair
to
be
fruitless
my
son
insisted
upon
joining
him
and
the
two
looked
the
ground
over
inch
by
inch
from
the
place
where
deane
had
set
foot
to
ground
in
alighting
from
his
carriage
to
the
exact
spot
where
he
had
stood
when
he
had
finally
seized
hold
of
the
horse
but
no
ruby
then
harrison
that
is
my
son
name
sent
for
a
broom
and
went
over
the
place
again
sweeping
aside
the
surface
snow
and
examining
carefully
the
ground
beneath
but
with
no
better
results
than
before
no
ruby
could
be
found
my
son
came
to
me
panting
burton
and
myself
stood
awaiting
him
in
a
state
of
suspense
guests
and
fête
were
alike
forgotten
we
had
heard
that
the
jewel
had
been
found
on
the
campus
by
one
of
the
students
and
had
been
brought
back
as
far
as
the
step
in
front
and
then
lost
again
in
some
unaccountable
manner
in
the
snow
and
we
hoped
nay
expected
from
moment
to
moment
that
it
would
be
brought
in
when
harrison
entered
then
pale
disheveled
and
shaking
his
head
burton
caught
me
by
the
hand
and
i
thought
she
would
faint
for
this
jewel
is
of
far
greater
value
to
her
than
its
mere
worth
in
money
though
that
is
by
no
means
small
it
is
a
family
jewel
and
was
given
to
her
by
her
husband
under
special
circumstances
he
prizes
it
even
more
than
she
does
and
he
is
not
here
to
counsel
or
assist
her
in
this
extremity
besides
she
was
wearing
it
in
direct
opposition
to
his
expressed
wishes
this
i
must
tell
you
to
show
how
imperative
it
is
for
us
to
recover
it
also
to
account
for
the
large
reward
she
is
willing
to
pay
when
he
last
looked
at
it
he
noticed
that
the
fastening
was
a
trifle
slack
and
though
he
handed
the
trinket
back
he
told
her
distinctly
that
she
was
not
to
wear
it
till
it
had
been
either
to
tiffany
or
starr
but
she
considered
it
safe
enough
and
put
it
on
to
please
the
boys
and
lost
it
senator
burton
is
a
hard
man
and
in
short
the
jewel
must
be
found
i
give
you
just
one
hour
in
which
to
do
it
but
madam
i
protested
i
know
she
put
in
with
a
quick
nod
and
a
glance
over
her
shoulder
to
see
if
the
door
was
shut
i
have
not
finished
my
story
hearing
what
harrison
had
to
say
i
took
action
at
once
i
bade
him
call
in
the
guests
whom
curiosity
or
interest
still
detained
on
the
porch
and
seat
them
in
a
certain
room
which
i
designated
to
him
then
after
telling
him
to
send
two
men
to
the
gates
with
orders
to
hold
back
all
further
carriages
from
entering
and
two
others
to
shovel
up
and
cart
away
to
the
stable
every
particle
of
snow
for
ten
feet
each
side
of
the
front
step
i
asked
to
see
deane
but
here
my
son
whispered
something
into
my
ear
which
it
is
my
duty
to
repeat
it
was
to
the
effect
that
deane
believed
that
the
jewel
had
been
taken
from
him
that
he
insisted
in
fact
that
he
had
felt
a
hand
touch
his
breast
while
he
stood
awaiting
an
opportunity
to
seize
the
horse
good
said
i
remember
that
too
but
first
see
that
my
orders
are
carried
out
and
that
all
approaches
to
the
grounds
are
guarded
and
no
one
allowed
to
come
in
or
go
out
without
permission
from
me
he
left
us
and
i
was
turning
to
encourage
burton
when
my
attention
was
caught
by
the
eager
face
of
a
little
friend
of
mine
who
quite
unknown
to
me
was
sitting
in
one
of
the
corners
of
the
room
she
was
studying
my
countenance
in
a
sort
of
subdued
anxiety
hardly
natural
in
one
so
young
and
i
was
about
to
call
her
to
my
side
and
question
her
when
she
made
a
sudden
dive
and
vanished
from
the
room
some
impulse
made
me
follow
her
she
is
a
conscientious
little
thing
but
timid
as
a
hare
and
though
i
saw
she
had
something
to
say
it
was
with
difficulty
i
could
make
her
speak
only
after
the
most
solemn
assurances
that
her
name
should
not
be
mentioned
in
the
matter
would
she
give
me
the
following
bit
of
information
which
you
may
possibly
think
throws
another
light
upon
the
affair
it
seems
that
she
was
looking
out
of
one
of
the
front
windows
when
deane
carriage
drove
up
she
had
been
watching
the
antics
of
the
horse
attached
to
the
buggy
but
as
soon
as
she
saw
deane
going
to
the
assistance
of
those
in
danger
she
let
her
eyes
stray
back
to
the
ladies
whom
he
had
left
behind
him
in
the
carriage
she
did
not
know
these
ladies
but
their
looks
and
gestures
interested
her
and
she
watched
them
quite
intently
as
they
leaped
to
the
ground
and
made
their
way
toward
the
porch
one
went
on
quickly
and
without
pause
to
the
step
but
the
other
the
one
who
came
last
did
not
do
this
she
stopped
a
moment
perhaps
to
watch
the
horse
in
front
perhaps
to
draw
her
cloak
more
closely
about
her
and
when
she
again
moved
on
it
was
with
a
start
and
a
hurried
glance
at
her
feet
terminating
in
a
quick
turn
and
a
sudden
stooping
to
the
ground
when
she
again
stood
upright
she
had
something
in
her
hand
which
she
thrust
furtively
into
her
breast
how
was
this
lady
dressed
i
inquired
in
a
white
cloak
with
an
edging
of
fur
i
took
pains
to
learn
that
too
and
it
was
with
some
curiosity
i
assure
you
that
i
examined
the
few
guests
who
had
now
been
admitted
to
the
room
i
had
so
carefully
pointed
out
to
my
son
two
of
them
wore
white
cloaks
but
one
of
these
was
dalrymple
and
i
did
not
give
her
or
her
cloak
a
second
thought
the
other
was
a
tall
girl
with
an
air
and
bearing
calculated
to
rouse
admiration
if
she
had
not
shown
so
very
plainly
that
she
was
in
a
state
of
inner
perturbation
though
she
tried
to
look
amiable
and
pleased
i
saw
that
she
had
some
care
on
her
mind
which
had
she
been
deane
would
have
needed
no
explanation
but
as
she
was
only
deane
friend
its
cause
was
not
so
apparent
the
floor
of
the
room
as
i
had
happily
remembered
was
covered
with
crash
and
as
i
lifted
each
garment
off
i
allowed
no
maid
to
assist
me
in
this
i
shook
it
well
ostensibly
because
of
the
few
flakes
clinging
to
it
really
to
see
if
anything
could
be
shaken
out
of
it
of
course
i
met
with
no
success
i
had
not
expected
to
but
it
is
my
disposition
to
be
thorough
these
wraps
i
saw
all
hung
in
an
adjoining
closet
the
door
of
which
i
locked
here
is
the
key
after
which
i
handed
my
guests
over
to
my
son
who
led
them
into
the
where
they
joined
the
few
others
who
had
previously
arrived
and
went
myself
to
telephone
to
i
bowed
and
asked
where
the
young
people
were
now
still
in
the
i
have
ordered
the
musicians
to
play
and
consequently
there
is
more
or
less
dancing
but
of
course
nothing
can
remove
the
wet
blanket
which
has
fallen
over
us
all
nothing
but
the
finding
of
this
jewel
do
you
see
your
way
to
accomplishing
this
we
are
from
this
very
moment
at
your
disposal
only
i
pray
that
you
will
make
no
more
disturbance
than
is
necessary
and
if
possible
arouse
no
suspicions
you
can
not
back
up
by
facts
i
dread
a
scandal
almost
as
much
as
i
do
sickness
and
death
and
these
young
people
well
their
lives
are
all
before
them
and
neither
burton
nor
myself
would
wish
to
throw
the
shadow
of
a
false
suspicion
over
the
least
of
them
i
assured
her
that
i
sympathized
with
her
scruples
and
would
do
my
best
to
recover
the
ruby
without
inflicting
undue
annoyance
upon
the
innocent
then
i
inquired
whether
it
was
known
that
a
detective
had
been
called
in
she
seemed
to
think
it
was
suspected
by
some
if
not
by
all
at
which
my
way
seemed
a
trifle
complicated
we
were
about
to
proceed
when
another
thought
struck
me
madam
you
have
not
said
whether
the
carriage
itself
was
searched
i
forgot
yes
the
carriage
was
thoroughly
overhauled
and
before
the
coachman
left
the
box
who
did
this
overhauling
my
son
he
would
not
trust
any
other
hand
than
his
own
in
a
business
of
this
kind
one
more
question
madam
was
any
one
seen
to
approach
deane
on
the
prior
to
his
assertion
that
the
jewel
was
lost
no
there
were
no
tracks
in
the
snow
of
any
such
my
son
looked
and
i
would
look
or
so
i
decided
within
myself
but
i
said
nothing
and
in
silence
we
proceeded
toward
the
i
had
left
my
overcoat
behind
me
and
always
being
i
did
not
present
so
bad
an
appearance
still
i
was
not
in
party
attire
and
naturally
could
not
pass
for
a
guest
if
i
had
wanted
to
which
i
did
not
i
felt
that
i
must
rely
on
insight
in
this
case
and
on
a
certain
power
i
had
always
possessed
of
reading
faces
that
the
case
called
for
just
this
species
of
intuition
i
was
positive
burton
ruby
was
within
a
hundred
yards
of
us
at
this
very
moment
probably
within
a
hundred
feet
but
to
lay
hands
on
it
and
without
scandal
well
that
was
a
problem
calculated
to
rouse
the
interest
of
even
an
old
like
myself
a
strain
of
music
desultory
however
and
spiritless
like
everything
else
about
the
place
that
night
greeted
us
as
ashley
opened
the
door
leading
directly
into
the
large
front
hall
immediately
a
scene
meant
to
be
festive
but
which
was
in
fact
desolate
burst
upon
us
the
lights
the
flowers
and
the
brilliant
appearance
of
such
ladies
as
flitted
into
sight
from
the
almost
empty
parlors
were
all
suggestive
of
the
cheer
suitable
to
a
great
occasion
but
in
spite
of
this
the
effect
was
altogether
melancholy
for
the
hundreds
who
should
have
graced
this
scene
and
for
whom
this
illumination
had
been
made
and
these
festoons
hung
had
been
turned
away
from
the
gates
and
the
few
who
felt
they
must
remain
because
their
hostess
showed
no
disposition
to
let
them
go
wore
any
but
holiday
faces
for
all
their
forced
smiles
and
pitiful
attempts
at
nonchalance
and
gaiety
i
scrutinized
these
faces
carefully
i
detected
nothing
in
them
but
annoyance
at
a
situation
which
certainly
was
anything
but
pleasant
turning
to
ashley
i
requested
her
to
be
kind
enough
to
point
out
her
son
adding
that
i
should
be
glad
to
have
a
moment
conversation
with
him
also
with
deane
deane
is
in
one
of
those
small
rooms
over
there
he
is
quite
upset
not
even
burton
can
comfort
him
my
son
oh
there
is
harrison
a
tall
young
man
was
crossing
the
hall
ashley
called
him
to
her
and
in
another
moment
we
were
standing
together
in
one
of
the
empty
parlors
i
gave
him
my
name
and
told
him
my
business
then
i
said
your
mother
has
allotted
me
an
hour
in
which
to
find
the
valuable
jewel
which
has
just
been
lost
on
these
premises
here
i
smiled
she
evidently
has
great
confidence
in
my
ability
i
must
see
that
i
do
not
disappoint
her
all
this
time
i
was
examining
his
face
it
was
a
handsome
one
as
i
have
said
but
it
had
also
a
very
candid
expression
the
eyes
looked
straight
into
mine
and
while
showing
anxiety
betrayed
no
deeper
emotion
than
the
occasion
naturally
called
for
have
you
any
suggestions
to
offer
i
understand
that
you
were
on
the
ground
almost
as
soon
as
deane
discovered
his
loss
his
eyes
changed
a
trifle
but
did
not
swerve
of
course
he
had
been
informed
by
his
mother
of
the
suspicious
action
of
the
young
lady
who
had
been
a
member
of
that
gentleman
party
and
shrank
as
any
one
in
his
position
would
from
the
responsibilities
entailed
by
this
knowledge
no
said
he
we
have
done
all
we
can
the
next
move
must
come
from
you
there
is
one
that
will
settle
the
matter
in
a
moment
i
assured
him
still
with
my
eyes
fixed
scrutinizingly
on
his
face
a
universal
search
not
of
places
but
of
persons
but
it
is
a
harsh
measure
a
most
disagreeable
one
he
emphasized
flushing
such
an
indignity
offered
to
guests
would
never
be
forgotten
or
forgiven
true
but
if
they
offered
to
submit
to
this
themselves
they
how
if
the
son
of
the
house
their
host
we
may
say
should
call
them
together
and
for
your
own
satisfaction
empty
out
your
pockets
in
the
sight
of
every
one
do
you
think
that
all
the
men
and
possibly
all
the
women
too
here
i
let
my
voice
fall
suggestively
would
be
glad
to
follow
suit
it
could
be
done
in
apparent
joke
he
shook
his
head
with
a
air
which
raised
him
high
in
my
estimation
that
would
call
for
little
but
effrontery
on
my
part
said
he
but
think
what
it
would
demand
from
these
boys
who
came
here
for
the
sole
purpose
of
enjoying
themselves
i
will
not
so
much
as
mention
the
ladies
yet
one
of
the
latter
i
know
he
quietly
acknowledged
growing
restless
for
the
first
time
i
withdrew
my
eyes
from
his
face
i
had
learned
what
i
wished
personally
he
did
not
shrink
from
search
therefore
the
jewel
was
not
in
his
pockets
this
left
but
two
persons
for
suspicion
to
halt
between
but
i
disclosed
nothing
of
my
thoughts
i
merely
asked
pardon
for
a
suggestion
that
while
pardonable
in
a
man
accustomed
to
handle
crime
with
ungloved
hands
could
not
fail
to
prove
offensive
to
a
gentleman
like
himself
we
must
move
by
means
less
open
i
concluded
it
adds
to
our
difficulties
but
that
can
not
be
helped
i
should
now
like
a
glimpse
of
mr
deane
do
you
not
wish
to
speak
to
him
i
should
prefer
a
sight
of
his
face
first
he
led
me
across
the
hall
and
pointed
through
an
open
door
in
the
center
of
a
small
room
containing
a
table
and
some
chairs
i
perceived
a
young
man
sitting
with
fallen
head
and
dejected
air
staring
at
vacancy
by
his
side
with
hand
laid
on
his
knelt
a
young
girl
striving
in
this
gentle
but
speechless
way
to
comfort
him
it
made
a
pathetic
picture
i
drew
ashley
away
i
am
disposed
to
believe
in
that
young
man
said
i
if
he
still
has
the
jewel
he
would
not
try
to
carry
off
the
situation
in
just
this
way
he
really
looks
oh
he
is
dreadfully
cut
up
if
you
could
have
seen
how
frantically
he
searched
for
the
stone
and
the
depression
into
which
he
fell
when
he
realized
that
it
was
not
to
be
found
you
would
not
doubt
him
for
an
instant
what
made
you
think
he
might
still
have
the
ruby
oh
we
police
officers
think
of
everything
then
the
fact
that
he
insists
that
something
or
some
one
touched
his
breast
on
the
driveway
strikes
me
as
a
trifle
suspicious
your
mother
says
that
no
second
person
could
have
been
there
or
the
snow
would
have
given
evidence
of
it
yes
i
looked
expressly
of
course
the
drive
itself
was
full
of
and
for
several
carriages
had
already
passed
over
it
then
there
were
all
of
deane
footsteps
but
no
other
man
as
far
as
i
could
see
yet
he
insists
that
he
was
touched
or
struck
yes
with
no
one
there
to
touch
or
strike
him
ashley
was
silent
let
us
step
out
and
take
a
view
of
the
place
i
suggested
i
should
prefer
doing
this
to
questioning
the
young
man
in
his
present
state
of
mind
then
as
we
turned
to
put
on
our
coats
i
asked
with
suitable
precaution
do
you
suppose
that
he
has
the
same
secret
suspicions
as
ourselves
and
that
it
is
to
hide
these
he
insists
upon
the
having
been
taken
away
from
him
at
a
point
the
ladies
are
known
not
to
have
approached
young
ashley
bent
somewhat
startled
eyes
on
mine
nothing
has
been
said
to
him
of
what
miss
peters
saw
miss
glover
do
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
mention
it
i
have
not
even
allowed
myself
to
believe
here
a
fierce
gust
blowing
in
from
the
door
he
had
just
opened
cut
short
his
words
and
neither
of
us
spoke
again
till
we
stood
on
the
exact
spot
in
the
driveway
where
the
episode
we
were
endeavoring
to
understand
had
taken
place
oh
i
cried
as
soon
as
i
could
look
about
me
the
mystery
is
explained
look
at
that
bush
or
perhaps
you
call
it
a
shrub
if
the
wind
were
blowing
as
freshly
as
it
is
now
and
very
probably
it
was
one
of
those
slender
branches
might
easily
be
switched
against
his
breast
especially
if
he
stood
as
you
say
he
did
close
against
this
border
well
i
a
fool
only
the
other
day
i
told
the
gardener
that
these
branches
would
need
trimming
in
the
spring
and
yet
i
never
so
much
as
thought
of
them
when
deane
spoke
of
something
striking
his
breast
as
we
turned
back
i
made
this
remark
with
this
explanation
of
the
one
doubtful
point
in
his
otherwise
plausible
account
we
can
credit
his
story
as
being
in
the
main
true
which
i
calmly
added
places
him
above
suspicion
and
narrows
our
inquiry
down
to
we
had
moved
quickly
and
were
now
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
by
which
we
had
come
out
ashley
i
continued
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
add
to
your
former
favors
that
of
showing
me
the
young
lady
in
whom
from
this
moment
on
we
are
especially
interested
if
you
can
manage
to
let
me
see
her
first
without
her
seeing
me
i
shall
be
infinitely
obliged
to
you
i
do
not
know
where
she
is
i
shall
have
to
search
for
her
i
will
wait
by
the
hall
door
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
to
me
come
said
he
and
led
me
into
what
i
judged
to
be
the
library
with
a
gesture
toward
one
of
the
windows
he
backed
quickly
out
leaving
me
to
face
the
situation
alone
i
was
rather
glad
of
this
glancing
in
the
direction
he
had
indicated
and
perceiving
the
figure
of
a
young
lady
standing
with
her
back
to
me
on
the
farther
side
of
a
flowing
lace
curtain
i
took
a
few
steps
toward
her
hoping
that
the
movement
would
cause
her
to
turn
but
it
entirely
failed
to
produce
this
effect
nor
did
she
give
any
sign
that
she
noted
the
intrusion
this
prevented
me
from
catching
the
glimpse
of
her
face
which
i
so
desired
and
obliged
me
to
confine
myself
to
a
study
of
her
dress
and
attitude
the
former
was
very
elegant
more
elegant
than
the
appearance
of
her
two
friends
had
led
me
to
expect
though
i
am
far
from
being
an
authority
on
feminine
toilets
i
yet
had
experience
enough
to
know
that
those
sweeping
folds
of
spotless
satin
with
their
festoons
of
lace
and
loops
of
shiny
trimming
which
it
would
be
folly
for
me
to
attempt
to
describe
represented
not
only
the
best
efforts
of
the
dressmaker
art
but
very
considerable
means
on
the
part
of
the
woman
wearing
such
a
gown
this
was
a
discovery
which
altered
the
complexion
of
my
thoughts
for
a
moment
for
i
had
presupposed
her
a
girl
of
humble
means
willing
to
sacrifice
certain
scruples
to
obtain
a
little
extra
money
this
imposing
figure
might
be
that
of
a
millionaire
daughter
how
then
could
i
associate
her
even
in
my
own
mind
with
theft
i
decided
that
i
must
see
her
face
before
giving
answer
to
these
doubts
she
did
not
seem
inclined
to
turn
she
had
raised
the
shade
from
before
the
wintry
panes
and
was
engaged
in
looking
out
her
attitude
was
not
that
of
one
simply
enjoying
a
moment
respite
from
the
dance
it
was
rather
that
of
an
absorbed
mind
brooding
upon
what
gave
little
or
no
pleasure
and
as
i
further
gazed
and
noted
the
droop
of
her
lovely
shoulders
and
the
languor
visible
in
her
whole
bearing
i
began
to
regard
a
glimpse
of
her
features
as
imperative
moving
forward
i
came
upon
her
suddenly
excuse
me
miss
smith
i
boldly
exclaimed
then
paused
for
she
had
turned
instinctively
and
i
had
seen
that
for
which
i
had
risked
this
daring
move
your
pardon
i
hastily
apologized
i
mistook
you
for
another
young
lady
and
drew
back
with
a
low
bow
to
let
her
pass
for
i
saw
that
she
thought
only
of
escaping
both
me
and
the
room
and
i
did
not
wonder
at
this
for
her
eyes
were
streaming
with
tears
and
her
face
which
was
doubtless
a
pretty
one
under
ordinary
conditions
looked
so
distorted
with
distracting
emotions
that
she
was
no
fit
subject
for
any
man
eye
let
alone
that
of
a
officer
of
the
law
on
the
lookout
for
the
guilty
hand
which
had
just
appropriated
a
jewel
worth
anywhere
from
eight
to
ten
thousand
dollars
yet
i
was
glad
to
see
her
weep
for
only
first
offenders
weep
and
first
offenders
are
amenable
to
influence
especially
if
they
have
been
led
into
wrong
by
impulse
and
are
weak
rather
than
wicked
anxious
to
make
no
blunder
i
resolved
before
proceeding
further
to
learn
what
i
could
of
the
character
and
antecedents
of
the
suspected
one
and
this
from
the
only
source
which
offered
deane
affianced
this
young
lady
was
a
delicate
girl
with
a
face
like
a
flower
recognizing
her
sensitive
nature
i
approached
her
with
the
utmost
gentleness
not
seeking
to
disguise
either
the
nature
of
my
business
or
my
reasons
for
being
in
the
house
since
all
this
gave
me
authority
i
modulated
my
tone
to
suit
her
gentle
spirit
and
above
all
i
showed
the
utmost
sympathy
for
her
lover
whose
rights
in
the
reward
had
been
taken
from
him
as
certainly
as
the
jewel
had
been
taken
from
burton
in
this
way
i
gained
her
confidence
and
she
was
quite
ready
to
listen
when
i
observed
there
is
a
young
lady
here
who
seems
to
be
in
a
state
of
even
greater
trouble
than
deane
why
is
this
you
brought
her
here
is
her
sympathy
with
deane
so
great
as
to
cause
her
to
weep
over
his
loss
frances
oh
no
she
likes
deane
and
she
likes
me
but
not
well
enough
to
cry
over
our
misfortunes
i
think
she
has
some
trouble
of
her
own
one
that
you
can
tell
me
her
surprise
was
manifest
why
do
you
ask
that
what
interest
have
you
called
in
as
i
understand
to
recover
a
stolen
jewel
in
frances
glover
personal
difficulties
i
saw
that
i
must
make
my
position
perfectly
plain
only
this
she
was
seen
to
pick
up
something
from
the
driveway
where
no
one
else
had
succeeded
in
finding
anything
she
when
who
saw
her
i
can
not
answer
all
these
questions
at
once
i
smiled
she
was
seen
to
do
this
no
matter
by
whom
during
your
passage
from
the
carriage
to
the
stoop
as
you
preceded
her
you
naturally
did
not
observe
this
action
which
was
fortunate
perhaps
as
you
would
scarcely
have
known
what
to
do
or
say
about
it
yes
i
should
she
retorted
with
a
most
unexpected
display
of
spirit
i
should
have
asked
her
what
she
had
found
and
i
should
have
insisted
upon
an
answer
i
love
my
friends
but
i
love
the
man
i
am
to
marry
better
here
her
voice
fell
and
a
most
becoming
blush
suffused
her
cheek
quite
right
i
assented
now
will
you
answer
my
former
question
what
troubles
miss
glover
can
you
tell
me
that
i
can
not
i
only
know
that
she
has
been
very
silent
ever
since
she
left
the
house
i
thought
her
beautiful
new
dress
would
please
her
but
it
does
not
seem
to
she
has
been
unhappy
and
preoccupied
all
the
evening
she
only
roused
a
bit
when
deane
showed
us
the
ruby
and
said
oh
i
forgot
what
that
what
have
you
forgot
what
you
said
just
now
i
would
add
a
word
pardon
me
i
smilingly
interrupted
looking
as
fatherly
as
i
could
but
you
added
this
word
and
now
you
must
tell
me
what
it
means
you
were
going
to
say
she
showed
interest
in
the
extraordinary
jewel
which
deane
took
from
his
pocket
and
in
what
he
let
fall
about
the
expected
reward
that
is
she
looked
eagerly
at
the
ruby
and
sighed
when
he
acknowledged
that
he
expected
it
to
bring
him
five
hundred
dollars
before
midnight
but
any
girl
of
no
more
means
than
she
might
do
that
it
would
not
be
fair
to
lay
too
much
stress
on
a
sigh
is
not
miss
glover
wealthy
she
wears
a
very
expensive
dress
i
observe
i
know
it
and
i
have
wondered
a
little
at
it
for
her
father
is
not
called
very
well
off
but
perhaps
she
bought
it
with
her
own
money
i
know
she
has
some
she
is
an
artist
in
burnt
wood
i
let
the
subject
of
miss
glover
dress
drop
i
had
heard
enough
to
satisfy
me
that
my
first
theory
was
correct
this
young
woman
beautifully
dressed
and
with
a
face
from
which
the
rounded
lines
of
early
girlhood
had
not
yet
departed
held
in
her
possession
probably
at
this
very
moment
burton
magnificent
jewel
but
where
on
her
person
or
hidden
in
some
of
her
belongings
i
remembered
the
cloak
in
the
closet
and
thought
it
wise
to
assure
myself
that
the
jewel
was
not
secreted
in
this
garment
before
i
proceeded
to
extreme
measures
ashley
upon
being
consulted
agreed
with
me
as
to
the
desirability
of
this
and
presently
i
had
this
poor
girl
cloak
in
my
hands
did
i
find
the
ruby
no
but
i
found
something
else
tucked
away
in
an
inner
pocket
which
struck
me
as
bearing
quite
pointedly
upon
this
case
it
was
the
bill
crumpled
soiled
and
of
the
dress
whose
elegance
had
so
surprised
her
friends
and
made
me
for
a
short
time
regard
her
as
the
daughter
of
wealthy
parents
an
enormous
bill
which
must
have
struck
dismay
to
the
soul
of
this
girl
who
probably
had
no
idea
of
how
a
french
dressmaker
can
foot
up
items
four
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
and
for
one
gown
i
declare
i
felt
indignant
myself
and
could
quite
understand
why
she
heaved
that
little
sigh
when
deane
spoke
of
the
five
hundred
dollars
he
expected
from
burton
and
later
how
she
came
to
succumb
to
the
temptation
of
making
the
effort
to
secure
this
sum
for
herself
when
in
following
the
latter
footsteps
up
the
driveway
she
stumbled
upon
this
same
jewel
fallen
as
it
were
from
his
pocket
into
her
very
hands
the
impulse
of
the
moment
was
so
strong
and
the
consequences
so
little
anticipated
it
is
not
at
all
probable
that
she
foresaw
he
would
shout
aloud
his
loss
and
draw
the
whole
household
out
on
the
porch
of
course
when
he
did
this
the
feasibility
of
her
project
was
gone
and
i
only
wished
that
i
had
been
present
and
able
to
note
her
countenance
as
crowded
in
with
others
on
that
windy
porch
she
watched
the
progress
of
the
search
which
every
moment
made
it
not
only
less
impossible
for
her
to
attempt
the
restoration
upon
which
the
reward
depended
but
must
have
caused
her
to
feel
if
she
had
been
as
well
brought
up
as
all
indications
showed
that
it
was
a
dishonest
act
of
which
she
had
been
guilty
and
that
willing
or
not
she
must
look
upon
herself
as
a
thief
so
long
as
she
held
the
jewel
back
from
deane
or
its
rightful
owner
but
how
face
the
publicity
of
restoring
it
now
after
this
elaborate
and
painful
search
in
which
even
the
son
of
her
hostess
had
taken
part
that
would
be
to
proclaim
her
guilt
and
thus
effectually
ruin
her
in
the
eyes
of
everybody
concerned
no
she
would
keep
the
compromising
article
a
little
longer
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
opportunity
of
returning
it
without
risk
to
her
good
name
and
so
she
allowed
the
search
to
proceed
i
have
entered
thus
elaborately
into
the
supposed
condition
of
this
girl
mind
on
this
critical
evening
that
you
may
understand
why
i
felt
a
certain
sympathy
for
her
which
forbade
harsh
measures
i
was
sure
from
the
glimpse
i
had
caught
of
her
face
that
she
longed
to
be
relieved
from
the
tension
she
was
under
and
that
she
would
gladly
rid
herself
of
this
valuable
jewel
if
she
only
knew
how
this
opportunity
i
proposed
to
give
her
and
this
is
why
on
returning
the
bill
to
its
place
i
assumed
such
an
air
of
relief
on
rejoining
ashley
she
saw
and
drew
me
aside
you
have
not
found
it
she
said
no
i
returned
but
i
am
positive
where
it
is
and
where
is
that
over
miss
glover
uneasy
heart
ashley
turned
pale
wait
said
i
i
have
a
scheme
for
getting
it
hence
without
making
her
shame
public
listen
and
i
whispered
a
few
words
in
her
ear
she
surveyed
me
in
amazement
for
a
moment
then
nodded
and
her
face
lighted
up
you
are
certainly
earning
your
reward
she
declared
and
summoning
her
son
who
was
never
far
away
from
her
side
she
whispered
her
wishes
he
started
bowed
and
hurried
from
the
room
by
this
time
my
business
in
the
house
was
to
all
and
i
could
not
appear
in
hall
or
parlor
without
a
great
silence
falling
upon
every
one
present
followed
by
a
breaking
up
of
the
only
too
small
circle
of
unhappy
guests
into
agitated
groups
but
i
appeared
to
see
nothing
of
all
this
till
the
proper
moment
when
turning
suddenly
upon
them
all
i
cried
out
cheerfully
but
with
a
certain
deference
i
thought
would
please
them
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
have
an
interesting
fact
to
announce
the
snow
which
was
taken
up
from
the
driveway
has
been
put
to
melt
in
the
great
feed
caldron
over
the
stable
fire
we
expect
to
find
the
ruby
at
the
bottom
and
ashley
invites
you
to
be
present
at
its
recovery
it
has
now
stopped
snowing
and
she
thought
you
might
enjoy
the
excitement
of
watching
the
water
ladled
out
a
dozen
girls
bounded
forward
oh
yes
what
fun
where
are
our
cloaks
our
rubbers
two
only
stood
hesitating
one
of
these
was
deane
lady
love
and
the
other
her
friend
miss
glover
the
former
perhaps
secretly
wondered
the
latter
but
i
dared
not
look
long
enough
or
closely
enough
in
her
direction
to
judge
just
what
her
emotions
were
presently
these
too
stepped
forward
into
the
excited
circle
of
young
people
and
were
met
by
the
two
maids
who
were
bringing
in
their
wraps
amid
the
bustle
which
now
ensued
i
caught
sight
of
deane
face
peering
from
an
open
doorway
it
was
all
alive
with
hope
i
also
perceived
a
lady
looking
down
from
the
second
story
who
i
felt
sure
was
burton
herself
evidently
my
confident
tone
had
produced
more
effect
than
the
words
themselves
every
one
looked
upon
the
jewel
as
already
recovered
and
regarded
my
invitation
to
the
stable
as
a
ruse
by
which
i
hoped
to
restore
universal
good
feeling
by
giving
them
all
a
share
in
my
triumph
all
but
one
nothing
could
make
miss
glover
look
otherwise
than
anxious
restless
and
unsettled
and
though
she
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
rest
it
was
with
hidden
face
and
lagging
step
as
if
she
recognized
the
whole
thing
as
a
farce
and
doubted
her
own
power
to
go
through
it
calmly
ah
ha
my
lady
thought
i
only
be
patient
and
you
will
see
what
i
shall
do
for
you
and
indeed
i
thought
her
eye
brightened
as
we
all
drew
up
around
the
huge
caldron
standing
full
of
water
over
the
stable
stove
as
pains
had
already
been
taken
to
put
out
the
fire
in
this
stove
the
ladies
were
not
afraid
of
injuring
their
dresses
and
consequently
crowded
as
close
as
their
numbers
would
permit
miss
glover
especially
stood
within
reach
of
the
brim
and
as
soon
as
i
noted
this
i
gave
the
signal
which
had
been
agreed
upon
between
ashley
and
myself
instantly
the
electric
lights
went
out
leaving
the
place
in
total
darkness
a
scream
from
the
girls
a
burst
of
hilarious
laughter
from
their
escorts
mingled
with
loud
apologies
from
their
seemingly
mischievous
host
filled
up
the
interval
of
darkness
which
i
had
insisted
should
not
be
too
soon
curtailed
then
the
lights
glowed
as
suddenly
as
they
had
gone
out
and
while
the
glare
was
fresh
on
every
face
i
stole
a
glance
at
miss
glover
to
see
if
she
had
made
good
use
of
the
opportunity
just
accorded
for
ridding
herself
of
the
jewel
by
dropping
it
into
the
caldron
if
she
had
both
her
troubles
and
mine
were
at
an
end
if
she
had
not
then
i
need
feel
no
further
scruple
in
approaching
her
with
the
direct
question
i
had
hitherto
found
it
so
difficult
to
put
she
stood
with
both
hands
grasping
her
cloak
which
she
had
drawn
tightly
about
the
rich
folds
of
her
new
and
expensive
dress
but
her
eyes
were
fixed
straight
before
her
with
a
soft
light
in
their
depths
which
made
her
positively
beautiful
the
jewel
is
in
the
pot
i
inwardly
decided
and
ordered
the
two
waiting
stablemen
to
step
forward
with
their
ladles
quickly
those
ladles
went
in
but
before
they
could
be
lifted
out
dripping
half
the
ladies
had
scurried
back
afraid
of
injury
to
their
pretty
dresses
but
they
soon
sidled
forward
again
and
watched
with
beaming
eyes
the
slow
but
sure
emptying
of
the
great
caldron
at
whose
bottom
they
anticipated
finding
the
lost
jewel
as
the
ladles
were
plunged
deeper
and
deeper
the
heads
drew
closer
and
so
great
was
the
interest
shown
that
the
busiest
lips
forgot
to
chatter
and
eyes
whose
only
business
up
till
now
had
been
to
follow
with
shy
curiosity
every
motion
made
by
their
handsome
young
host
now
settled
on
the
murky
depths
of
the
great
pot
whose
bottom
was
almost
in
sight
as
i
heard
the
ladles
strike
this
bottom
i
instinctively
withdrew
a
step
in
anticipation
of
the
loud
hurrah
which
would
naturally
hail
the
first
sight
of
the
lost
ruby
conceive
then
my
chagrin
my
bitter
and
mortified
disappointment
when
after
one
look
at
the
broad
surface
of
the
now
exposed
bottom
the
one
shout
which
rose
was
i
was
so
thoroughly
put
out
that
i
did
not
wait
to
hear
the
loud
complaints
which
burst
from
every
lip
drawing
ashley
aside
who
by
the
way
seemed
as
much
affected
as
myself
by
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
i
remarked
to
him
that
there
was
only
one
course
left
open
to
us
and
what
is
that
to
ask
miss
glover
to
show
me
what
she
picked
up
from
your
driveway
and
if
she
refuses
to
take
her
quietly
with
me
to
the
station
where
we
have
women
who
can
make
sure
that
the
ruby
is
not
on
her
person
ashley
made
an
involuntary
gesture
of
strong
repugnance
let
us
pray
that
it
will
not
come
to
that
he
objected
hoarsely
such
a
fine
figure
of
a
girl
did
you
notice
how
bright
and
happy
she
looked
when
the
lights
sprang
up
i
declare
she
struck
me
as
lovely
so
she
did
me
and
caused
me
to
draw
some
erroneous
conclusions
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
procure
me
an
interview
with
her
as
soon
as
we
return
to
the
house
she
shall
meet
you
in
the
library
but
when
a
few
minutes
later
she
joined
me
in
the
room
just
designated
and
i
had
full
opportunity
for
reading
her
countenance
i
own
that
my
task
became
suddenly
hateful
to
me
she
was
not
far
from
my
own
daughter
age
and
had
it
not
been
for
her
furtive
look
of
care
appeared
almost
as
blooming
and
bright
would
it
ever
come
to
pass
that
a
harsh
man
of
the
law
would
feel
it
his
duty
to
speak
to
my
flora
as
i
must
now
speak
to
the
young
girl
before
me
the
thought
made
me
inwardly
recoil
and
it
was
in
as
gentle
a
manner
as
possible
that
i
made
my
bow
and
began
with
the
following
remark
i
hope
you
will
pardon
me
miss
glover
i
am
told
that
is
your
name
i
hate
to
disturb
your
pleasure
this
with
the
tears
of
alarm
and
grief
rising
in
her
eyes
but
you
can
tell
me
something
which
will
greatly
simplify
my
task
and
possibly
put
matters
in
such
shape
that
you
and
your
friends
can
be
released
to
your
homes
i
she
stood
before
me
with
amazed
eyes
the
color
rising
in
her
cheeks
i
had
to
force
my
next
words
which
out
of
consideration
for
her
i
made
as
direct
as
possible
yes
miss
what
was
the
article
you
were
seen
to
pick
up
from
the
driveway
soon
after
leaving
your
carriage
she
started
then
stumbled
backward
tripping
in
her
long
train
i
pick
up
she
murmured
then
with
a
blush
whether
of
anger
or
pride
i
could
not
tell
she
coldly
answered
oh
that
was
something
of
my
own
something
i
had
just
dropped
i
had
rather
not
tell
you
what
it
was
i
scrutinized
her
closely
she
met
my
eyes
squarely
yet
not
with
just
the
clear
light
i
should
remembering
flora
have
been
glad
to
see
there
i
think
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
be
entirely
frank
said
i
it
was
the
only
article
known
to
have
been
picked
up
from
the
driveway
after
deane
loss
of
the
ruby
and
though
we
do
not
presume
to
say
that
it
was
the
ruby
yet
the
matter
would
look
clearer
to
us
all
if
you
would
frankly
state
what
this
object
was
her
whole
body
seemed
to
collapse
and
she
looked
as
if
about
to
sink
oh
where
is
minnie
where
is
mr
deane
she
moaned
turning
and
staring
at
the
door
as
if
she
hoped
they
would
fly
to
her
aid
then
in
a
burst
of
indignation
which
i
was
fain
to
believe
real
she
turned
on
me
with
the
cry
it
was
a
bit
of
paper
which
i
had
thrust
into
the
bosom
of
my
gown
it
fell
out
your
dressmaker
bill
i
intimated
she
stared
laughed
hysterically
for
a
moment
then
sank
upon
a
sofa
sobbing
spasmodically
yes
she
cried
after
a
moment
my
dressmaker
bill
you
seem
to
know
all
my
affairs
then
suddenly
and
with
a
startling
impetuosity
which
drew
her
to
her
feet
are
you
going
to
tell
everybody
that
are
you
going
to
state
publicly
that
miss
glover
brought
an
unpaid
bill
to
the
party
and
that
because
deane
was
unfortunate
enough
or
careless
enough
to
drop
and
lose
the
jewel
he
was
bringing
to
burton
she
is
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
thief
because
she
stooped
to
pick
up
this
bill
which
had
slipped
inadvertently
from
its
i
shall
die
if
you
do
she
cried
i
shall
die
if
it
is
already
known
she
pursued
with
increasing
emotion
is
it
is
it
her
passion
was
so
great
so
much
greater
than
any
likely
to
rise
in
a
breast
wholly
innocent
that
i
began
to
feel
very
sober
no
one
but
ashley
and
possibly
her
son
know
about
the
bill
said
i
and
no
one
shall
if
you
will
go
with
that
lady
to
her
room
and
make
plain
to
her
in
the
only
way
you
can
that
the
extremely
valuable
article
which
has
been
lost
is
not
in
your
possession
she
threw
up
her
arms
with
a
scream
oh
what
a
horror
i
can
not
i
can
not
oh
i
shall
die
of
shame
my
father
my
mother
and
she
burst
from
the
room
like
one
distraught
but
in
another
moment
she
came
cringing
back
i
can
not
face
them
she
said
they
all
believe
it
they
will
always
believe
it
unless
i
submit
oh
why
did
i
ever
come
to
this
dreadful
place
why
did
i
order
this
hateful
dress
which
i
can
never
pay
for
and
which
in
spite
of
the
misery
it
has
caused
me
has
failed
to
bring
me
the
she
did
not
continue
she
had
caught
my
eye
and
seen
there
perhaps
some
evidence
of
the
pity
i
could
not
but
experience
for
her
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
she
advanced
upon
me
with
the
appeal
save
me
from
this
humiliation
i
have
not
seen
the
ruby
i
am
as
ignorant
of
its
whereabouts
as
as
ashley
himself
wo
you
believe
me
wo
they
be
satisfied
if
i
swear
i
was
really
sorry
for
her
i
began
to
think
too
that
some
dreadful
mistake
had
been
made
her
manner
seemed
too
ingenuous
for
guilt
yet
where
could
that
ruby
be
if
not
with
this
young
girl
certainly
all
other
possibilities
had
been
exhausted
and
her
story
of
the
bill
even
if
accepted
would
never
quite
exonerate
her
from
secret
suspicion
while
that
elusive
jewel
remained
unfound
you
give
me
no
hope
she
moaned
i
must
go
out
before
them
all
and
ask
to
have
it
proved
that
i
am
no
thief
oh
if
god
would
have
pity
or
some
one
would
find
halloo
what
that
a
shout
had
risen
from
the
hall
beyond
she
gasped
and
we
both
plunged
forward
ashley
still
in
his
overcoat
stood
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
and
facing
him
were
ranged
the
whole
line
of
young
people
whom
i
had
left
scattered
about
in
the
various
parlors
i
thought
he
looked
peculiar
certainly
his
appearance
differed
from
that
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
and
when
he
glanced
our
way
and
saw
who
was
standing
with
me
in
the
library
doorway
his
voice
took
on
a
tone
which
made
me
doubt
whether
he
was
about
to
announce
good
news
or
bad
but
his
first
word
settled
that
question
rejoice
with
me
he
cried
ruby
has
been
found
do
you
want
to
see
the
culprit
for
there
is
a
culprit
we
have
him
at
the
door
shall
we
bring
him
in
yes
yes
cried
several
voices
among
them
that
of
deane
who
now
strode
forward
with
beaming
eyes
and
instinctively
lifted
hand
but
some
of
the
ladies
looked
frightened
and
ashley
noting
this
glanced
for
encouragement
toward
us
he
seemed
to
find
it
in
miss
glover
eyes
she
had
quivered
and
nearly
fallen
at
that
word
but
had
drawn
herself
up
by
this
time
and
was
awaiting
his
further
action
in
a
fever
of
relief
and
hope
which
perhaps
no
one
but
myself
could
fully
appreciate
a
vile
thief
a
most
unconscionable
rascal
vociferated
ashley
you
must
see
him
mother
you
must
see
him
ladies
else
you
will
not
realize
our
good
fortune
open
the
door
there
and
bring
in
the
robber
at
this
command
uttered
in
ringing
tones
the
huge
leaves
of
the
great
front
door
swung
slowly
forward
revealing
the
sturdy
forms
of
the
two
stablemen
holding
down
by
main
force
the
towering
figure
of
the
scream
of
astonishment
which
went
up
from
all
sides
united
to
ashley
shout
of
hilarity
caused
the
animal
unused
no
doubt
to
to
rear
to
the
length
of
his
bridle
at
which
ashley
laughed
again
and
gaily
cried
confound
the
fellow
look
at
him
mother
look
at
him
ladies
do
you
not
see
guilt
written
on
his
brow
it
is
he
who
has
made
us
all
this
trouble
first
he
must
needs
take
umbrage
at
the
two
lights
with
which
we
presumed
to
illuminate
our
porch
then
envying
burton
her
ruby
and
deane
his
reward
seek
to
rob
them
both
by
grinding
his
hoofs
all
over
the
snow
of
the
driveway
till
he
came
upon
the
jewel
which
deane
had
dropped
from
his
pocket
and
taking
it
up
in
a
ball
of
snow
secrete
it
in
his
left
hind
shoe
where
it
might
be
yet
if
spencer
here
he
bowed
to
a
strange
gentleman
who
at
that
moment
entered
had
not
come
himself
for
his
daughters
and
going
first
to
the
stable
found
his
horse
so
restless
and
seemingly
lame
there
boys
you
may
take
the
wretch
away
now
and
harness
him
but
first
hold
up
that
guilty
left
hind
hoof
for
the
ladies
to
see
that
he
stooped
to
examine
him
and
so
came
upon
here
the
young
gentleman
brought
forward
his
hand
in
it
was
a
nondescript
little
wad
well
soaked
and
shapeless
but
once
he
had
untied
the
kid
such
a
ray
of
rosy
light
burst
from
his
outstretched
palm
that
i
doubt
if
a
single
woman
there
noted
the
clatter
of
the
retiring
beast
or
the
heavy
clang
made
by
the
two
front
doors
as
they
shut
upon
the
eyes
and
tongues
were
too
busy
and
ashley
realizing
probably
that
the
interest
of
all
present
would
remain
for
a
few
minutes
at
least
with
this
marvelous
jewel
so
astonishingly
recovered
laid
it
with
many
expressions
of
thankfulness
in
burton
now
eagerly
outstretched
palm
and
advancing
toward
us
paused
in
front
of
miss
glover
and
eagerly
held
out
his
hand
congratulate
me
he
prayed
all
our
troubles
are
over
oh
what
now
the
poor
young
thing
in
trying
to
smile
had
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
before
either
of
us
could
interpose
an
arm
she
had
slipped
to
the
floor
in
a
dead
faint
with
a
murmur
of
pity
and
possibly
of
inward
contrition
he
stooped
over
her
and
together
we
carried
her
into
the
library
where
i
left
her
in
his
care
confident
from
certain
indications
that
my
presence
would
not
be
greatly
missed
by
either
of
them
whatever
hope
i
may
have
had
of
reaping
the
reward
offered
by
ashley
was
now
lost
but
in
the
satisfaction
i
experienced
at
finding
this
young
girl
as
innocent
as
my
flora
i
did
not
greatly
care
well
it
all
ended
even
more
happily
than
may
here
appear
the
horse
not
putting
in
his
claim
to
the
reward
and
spencer
repudiating
all
right
to
it
it
was
paid
in
full
to
deane
who
went
home
in
as
buoyant
a
state
of
mind
as
was
possible
to
him
after
the
great
anxieties
of
the
preceding
two
hours
miss
glover
was
sent
back
by
the
ashleys
in
their
own
carriage
and
i
was
told
that
ashley
declined
to
close
the
carriage
door
upon
her
till
she
had
promised
to
come
again
the
following
night
anxious
to
make
such
amends
as
i
personally
could
for
my
share
in
the
mortification
to
which
she
had
been
subjected
i
visited
her
in
the
morning
with
the
intention
of
offering
a
suggestion
or
two
in
regard
to
that
little
bill
but
she
met
my
first
advance
with
a
radiant
smile
and
the
glad
exclamation
oh
i
have
settled
all
that
i
have
just
come
from
madame
duprè
i
told
her
that
i
had
never
imagined
the
dress
could
possibly
cost
more
than
a
hundred
dollars
and
i
offered
her
that
sum
if
she
would
take
the
garment
back
and
she
did
she
did
and
i
shall
never
have
to
wear
that
dreadful
satin
again
i
made
a
note
of
this
dressmaker
name
she
and
i
may
have
a
bone
to
pick
some
day
but
i
said
nothing
to
miss
glover
i
merely
exclaimed
and
oh
i
have
an
old
spotted
muslin
which
with
a
few
natural
flowers
will
make
me
look
festive
enough
one
does
not
need
fine
clothes
when
one
is
happy
the
dreamy
smile
with
which
she
finished
the
sentence
was
more
eloquent
than
words
and
i
was
not
surprised
when
some
time
later
i
read
of
her
engagement
to
ashley
but
it
was
not
till
she
could
sign
herself
with
his
name
that
she
told
me
just
what
underlay
the
misery
of
that
night
she
had
met
harrison
ashley
more
than
once
before
and
though
she
did
not
say
so
had
evidently
conceived
an
admiration
for
him
which
made
her
especially
desirous
of
attracting
and
pleasing
him
not
understanding
the
world
very
well
certainly
having
very
little
knowledge
of
the
tastes
and
feelings
of
wealthy
people
she
conceived
that
the
more
brilliantly
she
was
attired
the
more
likely
she
would
be
to
please
this
rich
young
man
so
in
a
moment
of
weakness
she
decided
to
devote
all
her
small
savings
a
hundred
dollars
as
we
know
to
buying
a
gown
such
as
she
felt
she
could
appear
in
at
his
house
without
shame
it
came
home
as
dresses
from
french
dressmakers
are
very
apt
to
do
just
in
time
for
her
to
put
it
on
for
the
party
the
bill
came
with
it
and
when
she
saw
the
amount
it
was
all
itemized
and
she
could
find
no
fault
with
anything
but
the
summing
up
she
was
so
overwhelmed
that
she
nearly
fainted
but
she
could
not
give
up
her
ball
so
she
dressed
herself
and
being
urged
all
the
time
to
hurry
hardly
stopped
to
give
one
look
at
the
new
and
splendid
gown
which
had
cost
so
much
the
bill
the
incredible
the
enormous
bill
was
all
she
could
think
of
and
the
figures
which
represented
nearly
her
whole
year
earnings
danced
constantly
before
her
eyes
how
to
pay
it
but
she
could
not
pay
it
nor
could
she
ask
her
father
to
do
so
she
was
ruined
but
the
ball
and
ashley
these
still
awaited
her
so
presently
she
worked
herself
up
to
some
anticipation
of
enjoyment
and
having
thrown
on
her
cloak
was
turning
down
her
light
preparatory
to
departure
when
her
eye
fell
on
the
bill
lying
open
on
her
dresser
it
would
never
do
to
leave
it
there
never
do
to
leave
it
anywhere
in
her
room
there
were
prying
eyes
in
the
house
and
she
was
as
ashamed
of
that
bill
as
she
might
have
been
of
a
contemplated
theft
so
she
tucked
it
in
her
corsage
and
went
down
to
join
her
friends
in
the
carriage
the
rest
we
know
all
but
one
small
detail
which
turned
to
gall
whatever
enjoyment
she
was
able
to
get
out
of
the
early
evening
there
was
a
young
girl
present
dressed
in
a
simple
muslin
gown
while
looking
at
it
and
inwardly
contrasting
it
with
her
own
splendor
ashley
passed
by
with
another
gentleman
and
she
heard
him
say
how
much
better
young
girls
look
in
simple
white
than
in
the
elaborate
silks
only
suitable
for
their
mothers
thoughtless
words
possibly
forgotten
as
soon
as
uttered
but
they
sharply
pierced
this
already
sufficiently
stricken
and
uneasy
breast
and
were
the
cause
of
the
tears
which
had
aroused
my
suspicion
when
i
came
upon
her
in
the
library
standing
with
her
face
to
the
night
but
who
can
say
whether
if
the
evening
had
been
devoid
of
these
occurrences
and
no
emotions
of
contrition
and
pity
had
been
awakened
