the
heart
of
the
rose
he
was
her
brother
the
thought
gave
her
the
same
thrill
this
morning
as
it
had
given
her
on
a
morning
seventeen
years
back
when
the
old
family
doctor
had
laid
a
tiny
bundle
in
her
arms
and
said
you
have
to
be
his
sister
and
mother
both
elizabeth
her
twelve
years
then
hung
heavily
on
her
her
little
face
stained
with
the
marks
of
recent
tears
took
on
a
warmer
glow
as
she
touched
the
baby
hand
she
had
unfolded
the
baby
blanket
and
slipped
on
his
first
little
clothes
and
as
she
dressed
him
she
felt
a
sense
of
loss
with
every
fresh
garment
he
seemed
to
become
less
of
an
angel
and
more
of
a
human
being
the
same
feeling
of
loss
was
now
in
her
heart
as
she
folded
his
great
indian
blankets
slipped
his
photographs
into
the
case
and
filled
the
nooks
and
crevices
of
his
trunk
with
little
surprises
to
drive
away
the
first
bitter
longings
for
home
she
lifted
a
thick
white
wool
sweater
it
brought
the
memory
of
a
little
soft
flannel
shirt
she
buried
her
face
in
its
folds
and
murmured
in
a
tearful
voice
why
he
is
my
man
brother
and
i
am
sending
him
from
home
to
college
his
foot
sounded
on
the
stairway
his
clear
boyish
voice
called
beth
where
are
you
before
she
could
answer
he
entered
the
room
throwing
several
bundles
onto
the
bed
he
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
he
tugged
impatiently
at
the
strings
as
he
explained
these
are
some
things
the
girls
made
me
great
to
be
going
away
is
it
why
i
feel
just
like
i
was
getting
out
of
a
cage
i
feel
like
i
was
going
to
fly
say
what
is
this
anyway
he
held
up
a
small
book
shaped
to
resemble
the
bud
of
a
flower
it
was
made
of
white
paper
and
every
leaf
was
fastened
to
the
other
leaves
by
small
white
cords
on
the
front
was
the
picture
of
a
baby
on
the
back
was
a
pair
of
black
kid
doll
shoes
where
did
you
get
it
his
sister
asked
rose
gave
it
to
me
she
told
me
a
long
time
ago
that
she
was
making
me
a
book
of
memories
that
i
was
to
open
just
one
page
a
week
that
my
baby
picture
all
right
but
why
on
earth
has
she
put
those
doll
slippers
on
the
back
and
why
is
it
shaped
in
this
funny
way
what
makes
girls
such
queer
creatures
anyway
beth
she
laughed
i
guess
floyd
if
this
is
a
book
of
memories
that
last
page
is
to
picture
the
last
great
event
of
your
life
your
graduation
night
do
you
remember
how
your
new
patent
leathers
pinched
your
feet
so
that
you
limped
across
the
platform
after
your
diploma
it
is
shaped
like
a
rosebud
for
it
is
like
that
every
week
you
will
open
a
new
petal
and
finally
when
you
have
opened
them
all
it
will
be
a
rose
when
you
come
back
rose
will
have
unfolded
a
few
petals
too
well
i
am
going
to
unfold
every
one
of
these
right
now
i
never
could
wait
that
long
to
see
what
is
in
the
centre
of
course
i
have
a
vague
idea
but
i
want
to
be
sure
so
in
two
minutes
we
will
know
this
mystery
no
she
said
firmly
taking
the
book
from
his
hand
what
would
the
book
mean
to
you
then
floyd
every
particle
of
the
pleasure
the
expectation
would
be
gone
it
took
rose
a
long
time
to
make
this
book
and
you
surely
would
not
destroy
its
value
in
a
few
minutes
she
even
formed
every
leaf
like
a
petal
so
that
it
would
give
you
the
pleasure
of
watching
it
unfold
like
a
real
rose
it
is
just
a
symbol
of
herself
a
little
bud
of
promise
she
great
to
think
of
all
that
i
like
her
oh
she
and
dorothy
are
going
to
stop
a
minute
dot
has
something
for
me
and
i
want
them
to
see
some
of
my
things
but
i
do
want
to
open
this
book
i
guess
i
will
give
it
to
you
to
keep
until
i
am
ready
to
shut
this
trunk
so
it
wo
be
such
a
temptation
but
let
eat
pretty
soon
i
am
simply
starved
at
the
supper
table
he
talked
incessantly
of
his
departure
one
moment
he
wished
that
she
could
go
along
the
next
he
exulted
over
the
idea
of
being
in
a
house
with
a
crowd
of
fellows
while
he
talked
a
boy
came
to
the
door
and
was
dragged
in
by
a
ruthless
hand
while
they
ate
quantities
of
hot
waffles
they
talked
of
the
fellows
and
girls
for
the
most
part
they
talked
of
the
girls
the
sister
heard
new
phrases
a
new
language
he
had
always
used
a
different
one
to
her
they
spoke
of
girls
as
as
easies
as
stiffs
and
occasionally
floyd
stopped
in
the
centre
of
a
remark
and
nodded
his
head
warningly
towards
his
sister
but
the
talkative
john
rambled
on
speaking
in
a
free
and
easy
way
of
the
girls
he
had
grown
up
with
during
the
last
year
floyd
had
ceased
to
talk
to
his
sister
about
his
girl
friends
and
they
seldom
came
to
his
home
in
her
presence
his
comrades
talked
continually
of
school
but
if
she
was
busy
near
she
could
hear
them
laughing
and
chatting
in
tones
different
from
the
ones
they
used
when
she
was
there
she
had
tried
in
every
way
she
could
to
attract
them
to
her
home
for
formerly
they
had
come
in
great
crowds
but
floyd
did
not
seem
to
want
them
he
preferred
going
to
their
homes
at
times
she
wondered
if
she
had
been
in
their
way
when
they
had
come
when
the
two
girls
came
she
greeted
them
warmly
they
had
belonged
to
the
crowd
which
had
come
in
the
past
often
for
cookies
and
for
help
in
long
knotty
problems
then
thinking
they
might
not
remain
if
she
was
present
she
went
into
the
next
room
through
the
open
door
she
watched
them
she
could
not
help
watching
she
had
been
deprived
of
all
her
girlhood
and
now
she
wanted
to
enjoy
theirs
dorothy
a
dimpled
laughing
girl
with
great
brown
eyes
and
masses
of
curls
which
were
always
rumpled
threw
her
hat
into
a
chair
and
was
soon
seated
between
the
two
boys
showing
them
the
posters
she
had
made
for
floyd
the
sister
saw
floyd
move
very
close
to
the
girl
and
lay
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
with
a
caressing
movement
she
caught
the
glance
that
he
gave
a
glance
full
of
bold
admiration
and
meaning
rose
stood
near
the
table
watching
the
other
girl
in
her
eyes
was
a
look
of
longing
and
yet
it
was
mingled
with
fear
the
three
on
the
sofa
soon
drew
her
into
their
circle
john
was
open
in
his
admiration
of
both
girls
he
tried
to
distribute
his
caresses
with
an
impartial
hand
but
the
little
rose
drew
away
with
that
expression
of
dread
in
her
eyes
floyd
was
not
so
bold
he
lightly
laid
his
hand
on
her
hand
and
when
she
did
not
resent
it
clasped
it
more
firmly
her
face
flushed
but
she
suffered
the
hand
to
remain
elizabeth
was
called
from
the
room
by
some
visitors
when
they
had
finally
gone
she
came
back
to
her
former
seat
she
saw
a
new
brother
a
different
one
from
the
one
she
knew
he
was
talking
in
a
boisterous
tone
when
are
you
going
to
kiss
me
dot
he
asked
right
at
the
station
she
answered
laughingly
honour
bright
he
asked
honour
bright
she
promised
you
are
all
right
he
exclaimed
rose
is
too
bashful
for
that
then
he
hinted
but
you
see
i
am
going
to
take
her
home
rose
coloured
as
he
gave
her
a
significant
look
she
pushed
his
hand
from
her
arm
and
walked
to
the
piano
but
there
was
a
wavering
an
uncertainty
in
her
face
he
had
been
her
comrade
so
long
and
she
really
liked
him
the
watching
sister
made
a
quick
decision
when
the
girls
rose
to
go
she
stood
up
saying
floyd
i
want
you
and
john
to
watch
the
house
i
have
to
see
rose
mother
you
can
see
the
girls
again
there
came
a
flush
of
annoyance
on
the
boyish
face
followed
by
one
of
anger
he
knew
his
sister
had
been
listening
but
he
was
still
too
loyal
to
criticize
her
to
john
who
when
they
were
alone
openly
denounced
her
for
her
meddling
when
she
returned
floyd
was
alone
he
sat
sulky
and
silent
she
busied
herself
with
the
household
cares
for
a
few
minutes
soon
she
went
over
to
the
lounge
and
sat
down
beside
him
she
put
her
arm
around
him
and
kissed
his
forehead
let
do
be
angry
on
our
last
night
she
begged
why
did
you
do
it
he
asked
i
know
you
heard
what
i
said
to
rose
but
what
is
she
to
you
a
great
deal
she
responded
but
not
so
much
as
the
boy
i
love
so
dearly
the
boy
i
have
been
a
mother
to
and
yet
i
have
been
a
true
mother
for
i
never
have
talked
to
you
of
these
things
because
they
were
hard
you
see
i
have
failed
in
my
duty
instantly
he
was
all
tenderness
he
drew
her
down
into
his
boyish
long
arms
and
laid
his
head
against
hers
you
have
not
failed
in
anything
you
darling
he
cried
but
it
would
hurt
me
i
a
man
all
the
fellows
do
that
way
how
do
you
know
they
tell
about
it
we
do
all
talk
about
it
in
a
crowd
but
just
when
we
are
together
like
john
and
me
does
john
treat
rose
that
way
the
boy
grew
warm
in
a
minute
he
better
not
he
went
too
far
to
suit
me
why
did
he
she
asked
quietly
you
were
rather
free
towards
dorothy
dorothy
is
different
she
a
she
well
she
a
jolly
good
fellow
but
rose
well
i
like
rose
and
every
fellow
better
keep
his
hands
off
her
i
do
want
a
girl
all
the
fellows
can
love
but
i
different
those
things
do
hurt
a
fellow
he
coarser
and
well
it
expected
of
him
but
they
do
hurt
you
she
said
the
little
book
of
memories
that
rose
gave
you
this
afternoon
told
a
story
of
its
own
i
am
going
to
tell
you
this
story
he
looked
away
into
the
distance
and
she
began
once
there
was
a
man
who
went
into
a
garden
all
around
him
were
beautiful
roses
of
all
colours
but
he
chose
a
little
white
bud
for
his
he
chose
it
because
it
was
pure
and
white
but
most
of
all
because
it
was
closed
no
other
person
could
see
into
its
heart
while
he
was
waiting
for
it
to
unfold
he
walked
around
to
enjoy
the
other
flowers
he
studied
their
colouring
and
he
breathed
their
perfume
for
a
long
time
he
enjoyed
this
then
he
wanted
to
get
nearer
to
these
roses
to
handle
them
other
travellers
were
handling
them
and
they
seemed
to
enjoy
themselves
more
than
he
did
so
he
touched
one
rather
timidly
others
he
was
not
so
careful
with
at
last
he
grew
tired
and
wandered
back
to
his
own
rosebud
and
lo
it
had
opened
it
stood
the
whitest
and
most
fragrant
rose
in
the
garden
and
its
heart
was
the
dewiest
and
most
tender
but
he
remembered
the
crimson
roses
and
it
seemed
too
white
then
he
could
not
detect
its
fragrance
for
he
had
killed
his
sense
of
smell
by
its
abuse
with
the
other
roses
some
of
which
stood
as
high
and
beautiful
as
before
but
others
were
left
bruised
and
broken
by
his
ruthless
desire
to
please
yes
to
indulge
himself
as
he
plucked
his
own
rose
he
was
aware
of
no
sense
of
joy
over
it
except
from
pride
for
many
travellers
cast
him
envious
glances
but
he
could
not
see
its
unusual
beauty
he
could
not
get
the
fragrance
from
its
heart
because
his
sense
of
sight
had
been
dulled
by
the
brilliancy
of
the
other
flowers
and
his
sense
of
smell
by
their
odour
nor
did
he
think
of
the
little
buds
in
the
garden
that
he
had
touched
and
then
left
they
would
perhaps
open
but
the
petals
he
had
touched
would
always
be
brown
and
torn
the
might
not
see
them
when
the
flowers
had
opened
and
revealed
their
hearts
but
the
men
who
had
plucked
them
would
not
at
once
but
when
they
had
become
less
entranced
and
were
seeking
for
defects
then
perhaps
they
would
throw
the
roses
away
but
the
man
who
had
the
perfect
rose
the
one
which
was
perfect
because
it
had
been
well
protected
did
not
know
of
the
havoc
he
had
wrought
he
was
too
much
interested
in
wondering
why
he
did
not
enjoy
his
rose
why
it
seemed
so
commonplace
and
really
tiresome
he
did
not
know
that
it
was
he
who
had
become
unable
to
appreciate
it
through
his
own
indulgence
begun
in
an
idle
moment
while
he
had
waited
for
his
flower
to
blossom
she
paused
to
look
into
his
face
he
was
listening
then
she
went
on
you
say
you
are
a
man
you
have
only
thought
of
one
side
you
have
only
wanted
the
perfect
rose
you
may
get
one
but
if
you
do
it
will
be
one
which
has
been
carefully
guarded
you
are
not
intending
to
break
or
bruise
the
other
roses
you
are
just
going
to
handle
them
because
the
other
boys
do
you
will
enjoy
their
fragrance
but
you
will
leave
wounded
petals
then
after
a
time
if
you
travel
far
enough
into
the
garden
you
will
grow
indifferent
to
the
havoc
you
are
doing
and
will
carelessly
crush
the
flowers
you
may
grow
so
cruel
that
you
will
enjoy
it
there
are
men
who
do
and
they
started
out
as
free
from
intention
to
harm
as
you
were
you
caressed
dorothy
john
caressed
her
the
next
boy
who
comes
along
will
find
it
easier
to
be
free
with
her
and
unless
there
is
some
one
who
cares
enough
to
guard
her
she
will
be
torn
from
the
stem
before
she
has
blossomed
if
you
had
kissed
rose
it
would
have
been
easy
for
you
to
kiss
her
again
you
have
yet
have
you
he
shook
his
head
i
am
so
glad
she
continued
it
will
be
so
much
better
for
her
if
she
permits
you
these
familiarities
she
will
permit
others
the
same
ones
she
may
soon
become
as
reckless
as
dorothy
and
then
we
dare
not
think
of
the
future
you
can
see
now
what
a
wonderful
flower
she
promises
to
make
she
is
a
perfect
little
bud
would
you
not
hate
to
think
that
you
were
spoiling
the
promise
of
that
bud
forgive
me
for
being
so
cross
he
begged
yes
dear
and
she
kissed
his
lips
but
we
are
going
to
look
at
your
side
now
god
made
you
so
that
you
have
certain
desires
certain
cravings
that
you
are
to
control
many
men
will
say
that
they
are
only
to
be
satisfied
but
we
know
better
the
first
kiss
you
give
to
a
girl
thrills
you
really
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
minutes
of
your
life
the
next
girl
you
kiss
seems
less
of
a
pleasure
then
after
a
while
it
becomes
a
mere
habit
it
loses
all
sense
of
enjoyment
the
holiness
has
long
since
been
done
away
with
stronger
desires
than
kissing
arise
and
soon
you
are
not
the
man
god
intended
you
to
be
you
will
have
a
low
idea
of
women
even
your
wife
if
you
get
the
sweetest
and
purest
in
the
world
will
not
seem
so
to
you
marriage
will
not
be
a
sacred
fulfillment
it
will
be
a
commonplace
event
his
arms
had
tightened
around
her
but
he
was
silent
and
she
continued
your
future
career
as
a
man
will
be
touched
you
can
not
think
clearly
or
act
quickly
when
any
of
the
senses
of
your
body
have
been
impaired
lust
kills
ambition
ability
and
power
i
do
not
mean
that
every
boy
who
starts
in
this
way
has
the
same
fatal
ending
but
a
great
many
do
there
is
the
place
where
many
men
stop
yet
you
will
find
they
are
not
real
men
it
will
be
so
much
holier
and
better
to
stay
at
the
beginning
she
sat
silent
waiting
for
him
to
speak
at
last
he
did
of
course
beth
i
would
want
to
go
even
now
i
would
even
want
to
touch
and
a
tender
smile
played
around
his
lips
any
roses
but
one
but
i
can
not
see
yet
why
i
ca
let
her
know
that
i
care
for
her
i
will
be
constant
i
want
to
like
her
and
i
want
her
to
like
me
she
drew
a
sharp
breath
you
mean
you
will
crush
the
petals
of
your
own
rose
and
then
enjoy
the
heart
when
it
is
opened
when
you
come
back
you
may
not
even
want
to
see
that
heart
you
are
just
a
boy
if
you
do
there
will
be
times
when
you
will
see
those
crushed
petals
and
be
sorry
you
may
blame
yourself
but
you
will
probably
blame
rose
you
may
grow
so
discontented
that
you
will
blame
another
man
if
you
know
she
allowed
you
these
caresses
these
little
familiarities
you
will
think
she
would
allow
others
he
spoke
with
pride
i
know
rose
we
will
look
at
it
from
her
side
after
she
realizes
those
petals
have
been
crushed
by
you
she
may
be
afraid
of
the
future
she
may
be
afraid
that
you
have
wandered
far
into
the
garden
and
come
back
to
her
a
traveller
she
may
be
afraid
that
you
will
not
appreciate
her
and
that
you
will
not
deal
rightly
with
her
he
laughed
i
am
not
afraid
of
that
other
girls
just
as
constant
in
their
friendship
as
rose
have
felt
that
way
she
said
in
a
low
voice
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
my
dear
boy
i
have
a
few
wilted
petals
and
i
know
how
they
feel
you
see
i
was
like
you
are
there
was
no
one
to
guard
me
and
i
did
just
what
any
girl
will
do
who
does
not
think
but
i
realized
in
time
to
save
myself
from
only
a
few
brown
ones
and
i
want
to
save
every
girl
i
can
we
were
young
and
thought
we
knew
our
hearts
my
how
they
changed
but
they
could
change
those
bruised
petals
he
gave
a
hurt
cry
but
he
saw
a
face
free
from
suffering
it
held
only
love
for
him
floyd
i
want
to
give
the
world
a
noble
man
that
is
the
dearest
wish
of
every
woman
i
want
to
give
some
woman
a
pure
husband
and
oh
my
darling
boy
i
want
to
give
you
life
in
its
best
and
purest
forms
i
put
the
first
little
garment
on
your
little
body
i
changed
you
from
a
little
angel
to
a
human
being
and
i
must
care
for
that
human
being
you
angel
he
murmured
she
lifted
his
chin
and
looked
into
his
clear
eyes
i
promise
he
said
in
a
low
tone
it
will
not
be
easy
dear
you
will
have
to
refuse
to
listen
to
other
boys
you
will
have
to
read
only
good
books
and
you
will
have
to
think
pure
thoughts
rose
little
book
will
help
you
you
can
see
the
baby
that
i
am
trying
to
keep
pure
and
help
me
do
it
you
can
see
those
doll
shoes
and
remember
how
you
suffered
on
the
night
you
wanted
to
be
happy
because
you
wanted
to
do
as
fellows
did
you
were
so
anxious
to
know
what
was
in
the
heart
of
the
rose
book
i
do
not
know
but
she
did
tell
me
this
on
the
second
petal
and
you
must
look
at
it
every
day
is
the
little
picture
of
sir
galahad
which
your
first
teacher
gave
you
do
you
remember
it
the
boy
smiled
dreamily
as
he
quoted
my
strength
is
as
the
strength
of
ten
because
my
heart
is
pure
in
the
united
states
of
