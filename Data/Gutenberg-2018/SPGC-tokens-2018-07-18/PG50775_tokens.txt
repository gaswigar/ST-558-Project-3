chapter
i
i
commence
my
ghostly
investigations
in
dublin
in
starting
a
book
of
this
sort
i
believe
it
is
usual
to
say
something
about
one
s
self
i
was
born
in
the
seventies
my
father
came
from
county
limerick
and
belonged
to
the
truagh
castle
o
donnells
who
tracing
their
descent
from
shane
luirg
the
elder
brother
of
niall
garbh
the
ancestor
of
red
hugh
rightly
claim
to
be
the
oldest
branch
of
the
great
clan
he
graduated
at
trinity
college
dublin
was
for
some
time
vicar
of
a
parish
near
worcester
and
died
in
egypt
under
mysterious
and
much
discussed
circumstances
soon
after
i
came
into
the
world
see
the
oriental
by
hamilton
my
mother
was
english
she
belonged
to
an
old
midland
family
and
only
survived
my
father
a
few
years
although
i
am
generally
known
as
a
ghost
hunter
needless
to
say
it
was
not
for
such
a
career
that
i
was
educated
first
of
all
at
clifton
college
then
at
an
army
crammer
s
and
finally
at
chedwode
crawley
s
coaching
establishment
in
ely
place
dublin
there
i
read
for
the
royal
irish
constabulary
and
attending
regularly
remained
for
a
little
over
two
years
i
can
safely
say
these
two
years
were
two
of
the
happiest
i
have
ever
known
for
my
companions
at
that
time
were
the
nicest
set
of
fellows
i
have
ever
met
and
amongst
them
i
formed
many
lifelong
friendships
when
i
was
not
working
i
usually
spent
my
time
playing
football
or
cricket
to
both
of
which
sports
i
was
devoted
and
when
i
was
not
thus
engaged
i
used
to
tramp
across
hill
and
dale
continually
exploring
the
country
in
search
of
adventure
but
in
those
days
i
did
not
look
for
came
to
me
they
came
to
me
then
as
they
had
come
to
me
before
and
as
they
have
come
to
me
ever
since
with
my
early
experiences
of
the
experiences
by
the
way
extend
over
the
whole
period
of
my
have
dealt
fully
in
former
works
so
that
in
this
volume
i
propose
to
confine
myself
to
later
experiences
commencing
approximately
with
my
d√©but
as
an
investigator
of
haunted
houses
and
superphysical
occurrences
in
general
to
begin
with
however
let
me
state
plainly
that
i
lay
no
claims
to
being
what
is
termed
a
scientific
psychical
researcher
i
am
not
a
member
of
any
august
society
that
conducts
its
investigations
of
the
other
world
or
worlds
with
test
tube
and
weighing
apparatus
neither
do
i
pretend
to
be
a
medium
or
consistent
clairvoyant
i
am
merely
a
ghost
hunter
merely
one
who
honestly
believes
that
he
inherits
in
some
degree
the
faculty
of
psychic
perceptiveness
from
a
long
line
of
celtic
ancestry
and
who
is
and
always
has
been
deeply
and
genuinely
interested
in
all
questions
relative
to
phantasms
and
a
continuance
of
individual
life
after
physical
dissolution
moreover
in
addition
to
this
psychic
faculty
i
possess
as
i
have
already
hinted
a
spirit
of
adventure
and
since
this
spirit
is
irresistible
had
i
not
decided
to
become
a
ghost
hunter
i
should
doubtless
have
embarked
upon
some
other
and
hardly
less
exciting
pursuit
the
actual
cause
of
my
decision
to
adopt
as
a
profession
was
an
experience
which
befel
me
in
the
summer
of
i
was
at
that
time
a
student
in
ely
place
dublin
and
being
in
search
of
rooms
was
recommended
to
try
a
house
within
a
stone
s
throw
of
the
waterloo
road
a
widow
named
davis
with
two
leviathan
daughters
mona
and
bridget
ran
the
establishment
and
as
the
vacant
apartments
were
large
apparently
well
ventilated
and
exceedingly
moderate
in
price
i
decided
to
take
them
consequently
i
arrived
there
with
my
luggage
one
afternoon
and
was
speedily
engaged
in
the
tiring
and
somewhat
irritating
task
of
unpacking
when
i
retired
to
rest
that
first
night
i
certainly
had
no
thought
of
ghosts
or
anything
in
connection
with
them
on
the
contrary
my
mind
was
wholly
occupied
with
speculations
as
to
how
i
should
fare
in
the
coming
weekly
examination
at
crawley
s
whether
the
extra
attention
i
had
recently
bestowed
on
mathematics
would
be
of
any
service
to
me
or
whether
in
spite
of
it
i
should
again
occupy
my
place
at
the
bottom
of
the
class
i
remember
thinking
however
as
i
blew
out
the
light
and
turned
into
bed
that
there
was
something
about
the
room
i
could
not
tell
i
had
not
noticed
by
daylight
but
i
soon
went
to
sleep
and
although
i
awoke
several
times
before
phenomenon
in
can
not
say
that
i
thought
then
of
any
superphysical
element
in
the
atmosphere
it
was
not
until
i
had
been
there
several
nights
that
the
event
occurred
which
effectually
shaped
my
future
career
one
evening
the
two
girls
mona
and
bridget
were
making
so
much
racket
in
the
room
beneath
me
that
i
found
work
impossible
and
being
somewhat
tired
for
i
had
stuck
very
close
to
it
all
day
i
resolved
to
go
to
bed
on
my
way
thither
i
encountered
two
young
men
students
who
were
also
lodging
in
the
house
hotly
engaged
in
an
argument
and
they
appealed
to
me
to
express
an
opinion
i
told
them
what
i
thought
as
they
followed
me
upstairs
then
when
i
reached
my
room
i
abruptly
bade
them
and
entering
locked
the
door
behind
me
sitting
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
i
quietly
slipped
off
my
clothes
and
put
out
the
light
the
two
men
were
still
haranguing
one
another
for
all
they
were
worth
when
i
got
in
between
the
sheets
and
prepared
to
lie
down
the
room
was
not
entirely
dark
from
between
the
folds
of
the
thick
plush
curtains
that
enveloped
the
windows
stray
beams
from
the
powerful
moonlight
filtered
through
and
battled
their
way
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
i
was
looking
at
them
with
some
degree
of
curiosity
when
i
saw
something
move
i
glanced
at
it
in
astonishment
and
to
my
unmitigated
horror
the
shape
of
something
dark
and
sinister
rose
noiselessly
from
the
floor
and
came
swiftly
towards
me
i
tried
to
shout
but
could
not
make
a
sound
i
was
completely
paralysed
and
as
i
sat
there
sick
with
fear
and
apprehension
the
thing
leaped
on
to
me
and
gripping
me
mercilessly
by
the
throat
bore
me
backwards
i
gasped
and
choked
and
suffered
the
most
excruciating
pain
but
there
was
no
pressure
of
those
bony
fingers
only
tightened
and
the
torture
went
on
at
last
after
what
seemed
to
me
an
eternity
there
was
a
loud
buzzing
in
my
ears
my
head
seemed
to
spin
round
violently
and
my
brain
to
burst
i
lost
consciousness
on
coming
to
i
found
that
my
assailant
had
left
me
i
struck
a
light
my
were
still
going
at
one
another
hammer
and
the
door
was
as
i
had
left
it
locked
on
the
inside
i
searched
the
room
thoroughly
the
window
was
bolted
there
was
nothing
in
the
cupboard
nothing
under
the
bed
nothing
anywhere
i
got
into
bed
again
full
of
the
worst
anticipations
and
if
sleep
came
to
me
it
was
only
in
the
briefest
snatches
at
dawn
the
room
became
suffused
with
a
cold
grey
glow
and
the
suggestion
of
something
horribly
evil
standing
close
beside
the
bed
and
sardonically
watching
me
impressed
me
so
strongly
that
yielding
to
a
sudden
impulse
of
terror
i
hid
my
head
under
the
and
remained
in
that
undignified
position
till
the
morning
was
well
advanced
and
i
was
i
got
up
feeling
downright
ill
and
although
the
sunlight
metamorphosing
everything
now
made
the
mere
thought
of
a
ghost
simply
ludicrous
i
hurried
out
of
the
room
as
speedily
as
possible
nor
did
i
venture
to
pass
another
night
there
my
landlady
did
not
demur
when
i
asked
her
to
transfer
me
to
another
apartment
and
later
before
i
took
my
final
departure
from
her
house
she
confessed
to
me
that
it
was
haunted
she
believed
that
it
had
been
used
as
a
private
home
for
mentally
afflicted
people
and
that
someone
either
one
of
the
patients
or
a
did
not
know
died
under
extremely
painful
circumstances
in
the
room
i
had
first
occupied
the
davises
left
the
house
soon
after
i
did
and
who
lives
there
now
and
whether
the
hauntings
still
continue
i
can
not
say
when
i
last
made
enquiries
about
two
years
ago
i
learned
that
the
then
occupants
had
never
admitted
experiencing
anything
unusual
but
that
they
always
kept
the
room
in
which
i
had
undergone
the
sensations
of
strangulation
carefully
locked
this
adventure
of
mine
intensely
unpleasant
as
it
had
been
at
the
time
profoundly
interested
me
hitherto
i
had
placidly
accepted
as
truth
all
the
dogmas
of
religion
hurled
at
me
from
the
pulpit
and
drilled
into
me
at
school
for
the
simple
reason
that
i
had
always
been
taught
to
regard
as
infinitely
correct
and
absolutely
above
criticism
all
that
the
clergy
told
me
god
made
the
world
they
said
and
all
the
laws
and
principles
appertaining
to
was
need
not
ask
any
questions
when
i
looked
about
me
and
saw
men
and
women
dogs
horses
and
other
animals
suffering
indescribable
agonies
from
all
kinds
of
foul
and
malignant
diseases
when
i
encountered
cripples
the
maimed
and
blind
idiots
and
lunatics
or
read
in
the
papers
of
swindles
murders
and
suicides
or
noted
how
throughout
nature
the
strong
animals
prey
upon
the
weak
how
for
example
the
tiger
the
lion
and
the
leopard
terrorize
the
jungle
just
as
the
shark
and
octopus
terrorize
the
sea
and
the
wasp
and
spider
centipede
and
scorpion
terrorize
insect
life
being
furnished
respectively
with
weapons
for
tearing
and
rending
and
sucking
the
flesh
and
entailing
the
most
excruciating
tortures
on
the
nerve
centres
when
i
say
i
noted
all
this
i
was
given
to
understand
that
i
must
on
no
account
comment
upon
do
so
was
impious
and
must
abide
by
the
precept
of
my
pastor
and
pedagogue
namely
that
god
is
almighty
and
merciful
loving
and
but
now
it
was
was
no
longer
in
the
schoolroom
no
longer
under
the
immediate
influence
of
the
church
i
met
people
in
dublin
imbued
with
the
broader
instincts
of
a
big
cosmopolitan
community
i
listened
to
their
which
at
first
immeasurably
shocked
me
and
afterwards
struck
me
as
horribly
sane
then
at
this
crisis
came
the
incident
of
the
strangling
i
tried
to
attribute
it
to
a
dream
but
i
was
prevented
by
the
fact
that
i
had
only
just
got
into
bed
and
had
not
even
lain
down
when
the
figure
seized
me
hence
i
could
only
conclude
that
some
nature
of
my
suffering
and
the
horror
it
inspired
leading
me
to
suppose
that
it
was
a
particularly
evil
been
my
aggressor
but
why
was
it
not
in
hell
had
it
escaped
in
spite
of
the
strict
supervision
of
the
almighty
or
could
it
be
possible
that
the
orthodox
paradise
and
purgatory
did
not
exist
and
that
the
spirits
of
the
dead
were
allowed
to
wander
about
at
will
i
became
so
all
sorts
of
wild
speculations
floated
through
my
mind
i
resolved
to
enquire
further
i
would
not
be
guided
by
any
creed
i
would
set
out
on
my
work
of
investigation
wholly
unbiassed
i
would
gain
whatever
knowledge
there
was
to
be
gained
of
another
world
without
the
aid
either
of
priest
or
occultist
medium
or
scientist
several
of
my
friends
in
dublin
were
greatly
interested
in
ghosts
and
i
learned
from
them
of
two
houses
that
had
long
borne
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
one
was
close
to
stephen
s
green
within
sight
of
the
queen
s
service
academy
and
the
other
a
big
ugly
edifice
of
a
dingy
grey
was
in
blackrock
i
had
stayed
in
the
former
when
a
child
and
had
vivid
recollections
of
the
holes
in
the
stone
stairs
through
which
boiling
oil
was
poured
on
the
heads
of
the
english
soldiers
at
the
time
of
the
there
were
many
large
and
stately
rooms
in
the
house
and
beautified
throughout
with
much
carving
i
remember
looking
with
awe
and
perplexity
at
the
number
of
odd
shadows
that
used
to
put
in
an
appearance
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
passages
just
when
it
was
my
but
i
did
not
then
attribute
them
to
ghosts
i
simply
did
not
know
what
they
were
i
heard
sounds
and
clashes
and
footsteps
tramping
up
and
down
the
stairs
sounds
i
did
not
attempt
to
analyse
possibly
because
i
dared
not
that
was
in
i
was
then
a
small
boy
and
i
had
long
left
the
house
and
was
back
in
dublin
with
the
experience
of
the
strangling
ghost
still
fresh
in
my
mind
i
began
to
wonder
whether
these
strange
sounds
and
shadows
might
not
have
been
due
to
the
presence
of
the
superphysical
i
mentioned
the
matter
to
my
friends
and
they
expressed
astonishment
that
i
had
not
heard
the
house
was
haunted
one
of
them
a
lady
told
me
that
she
had
once
stayed
there
and
had
been
awakened
every
night
by
the
sounds
i
had
sounds
of
heavy
footsteps
rushing
up
the
stairs
of
cries
and
groans
shrieks
and
oaths
coupled
with
the
clashing
of
scabbards
and
sword
blades
and
the
sound
as
of
falling
bodies
yet
nothing
was
ever
to
be
seen
saving
the
moonlight
and
of
strangely
suggestive
of
grotesque
and
fancifully
clad
people
i
tried
to
obtain
permission
to
sleep
in
the
house
and
in
my
innocence
of
the
ways
of
landlords
i
stated
with
the
most
pathetic
candour
my
true
wanted
to
investigate
the
reply
i
got
was
certainly
not
courteous
neither
did
it
permit
of
argument
hence
feeling
considerably
crestfallen
and
humiliated
i
found
myself
forced
to
give
up
my
first
attempt
at
then
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
house
in
blackrock
and
fared
no
better
the
landlord
had
been
bothered
to
death
with
requests
to
spend
nights
there
and
was
endeavouring
to
discover
the
originator
of
the
report
that
the
place
was
haunted
in
order
that
he
might
bring
an
action
for
slander
of
title
consequently
i
could
only
examine
the
house
from
the
outside
hoping
that
its
ghostly
inhabitants
would
one
night
take
pity
on
me
and
exhibit
themselves
at
one
of
the
windows
but
in
this
too
i
was
disappointed
although
as
the
place
invariably
inspired
me
with
the
greatest
dread
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
but
that
it
was
genuinely
and
badly
haunted
there
were
several
stories
in
circulation
in
dublin
about
that
time
concerning
the
nature
of
the
haunting
and
the
of
the
most
told
me
by
a
blake
i
will
give
it
as
nearly
as
i
can
in
her
own
words
when
i
was
a
child
of
about
twelve
she
began
which
was
a
good
many
years
ago
my
father
who
was
then
stationed
in
dublin
took
the
house
on
a
three
years
lease
at
a
very
low
rental
due
so
the
owner
stated
to
the
fact
that
there
were
far
too
many
stairs
a
feature
to
which
most
people
on
account
of
their
servants
strongly
objected
nothing
was
said
about
ghosts
and
nothing
was
further
from
my
parents
minds
when
they
took
possession
we
moved
in
towards
the
end
of
july
but
it
was
not
until
the
middle
of
september
that
we
first
became
aware
that
the
house
was
haunted
it
happened
in
this
way
my
father
and
the
maids
were
out
one
evening
and
only
my
mother
my
small
brother
and
i
were
in
the
house
it
was
about
eight
o
clock
i
was
upstairs
in
the
nursery
reading
to
teddy
and
my
mother
was
in
the
two
storeys
beneath
i
was
just
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
when
teddy
interrupted
me
did
you
hear
that
he
exclaimed
it
s
someone
on
the
stairs
i
believe
they
are
i
paused
and
heard
a
loud
creak
who
can
it
be
i
said
there
s
only
mother
in
the
house
much
mystified
i
closed
the
book
and
went
out
on
to
the
landing
no
one
was
there
but
when
i
got
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
i
heard
a
loud
scream
and
then
a
dull
thud
just
as
if
someone
had
fallen
in
an
agony
of
mind
i
ran
downstairs
to
see
what
had
happened
as
i
arrived
in
the
hall
the
door
of
the
was
slowly
opened
and
i
saw
peeping
cautiously
out
a
white
face
with
two
dark
gleaming
eyes
that
filled
with
an
expression
of
the
most
diabolical
hatred
as
they
met
mine
i
was
so
terrified
that
i
started
back
some
paces
and
as
i
did
so
the
door
opened
a
little
wider
and
the
figure
of
a
short
elderly
woman
clad
in
an
black
dress
and
white
cap
crumpled
closely
round
her
lean
haggard
face
glided
out
and
passing
by
ascended
the
stairs
as
she
came
to
the
first
bend
she
turned
and
looking
down
at
me
with
an
evil
leer
shook
her
hand
menacingly
at
me
she
then
passed
out
of
sight
and
i
heard
her
climb
the
stairs
step
by
step
till
she
came
to
the
nursery
landing
a
moment
later
and
teddy
gave
a
violent
shriek
my
terror
was
now
so
great
that
i
think
i
should
have
gone
mad
had
i
been
left
there
any
longer
by
myself
but
by
a
merciful
providence
a
key
turned
in
the
lock
of
the
front
door
and
my
father
entered
the
sight
of
his
figure
on
the
threshold
at
once
loosened
the
spell
that
had
bound
me
and
with
a
cry
of
delight
i
clutched
him
by
the
arms
imploring
him
to
see
at
once
what
had
happened
to
mother
and
teddy
he
ran
into
the
first
and
found
my
mother
on
the
floor
just
reviving
from
a
faint
lighting
the
gas
he
fetched
her
some
brandy
and
then
bidding
me
stay
with
her
he
hastened
upstairs
to
teddy
the
latter
was
very
badly
frightened
and
it
was
some
days
before
he
was
well
enough
to
give
anything
like
a
coherent
account
of
what
had
happened
of
course
mother
and
father
told
teddy
that
the
queer
figure
they
had
seen
was
some
friend
of
the
servants
who
had
called
while
they
were
out
but
i
suppose
they
deemed
me
old
enough
to
know
the
truth
for
they
discussed
the
incident
openly
in
my
presence
it
appears
that
my
mother
had
been
quietly
knitting
in
the
when
she
suddenly
felt
very
cold
and
rising
from
her
chair
with
the
intention
of
closing
the
door
found
herself
confronted
by
a
hideous
form
subsequently
my
father
made
a
thorough
search
of
the
house
but
he
found
no
one
and
as
all
the
windows
were
fastened
and
the
doors
locked
on
the
inside
we
could
only
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
figure
my
mother
and
teddy
and
i
had
all
seen
was
a
ghost
a
few
days
later
it
appeared
to
my
father
he
was
coming
out
of
his
bedroom
when
he
saw
a
woman
steal
stealthily
out
of
a
room
on
the
same
landing
and
creep
downstairs
in
front
of
him
there
was
something
about
her
so
intensely
sinister
that
he
felt
chilled
but
determining
to
find
out
who
she
was
he
followed
her
and
catching
her
up
demanded
her
name
there
was
a
chuckling
answer
the
figure
instantly
disappeared
and
a
number
of
invisible
somethings
clattered
down
the
stairs
past
him
i
think
my
father
was
very
scared
at
all
events
he
came
into
the
with
a
very
white
face
and
ate
hardly
anything
some
time
after
this
when
the
autumn
was
well
advanced
my
uncle
came
to
stay
with
us
he
was
a
jolly
rollicking
sailor
who
had
fought
the
turks
at
navarino
and
had
had
many
exciting
adventures
with
chinese
pirates
no
one
told
him
the
house
was
haunted
it
was
decided
he
should
find
that
out
for
himself
one
afternoon
several
days
after
his
arrival
he
was
taking
off
his
boots
in
a
room
in
the
basement
when
a
current
of
icy
air
blew
in
on
him
and
on
raising
his
eyes
to
see
whence
the
draught
came
he
perceived
an
extraordinarily
pretty
girl
clad
in
a
dark
green
such
as
he
believed
were
worn
in
the
days
of
his
great
standing
in
the
doorway
watching
him
intently
this
is
one
of
jack
s
surprises
jack
was
my
father
he
said
to
himself
and
a
deuced
pleasant
one
too
the
rogue
he
knows
nothing
pleases
me
so
much
as
the
sight
of
a
pretty
girl
and
by
jove
she
is
pretty
springing
to
his
my
uncle
was
never
bashful
in
the
presence
of
the
fair
advanced
to
shake
hands
to
his
chagrin
however
she
promptly
turned
round
and
walking
swiftly
away
began
to
ascend
the
stairs
my
uncle
followed
her
on
and
on
she
led
him
till
she
came
to
the
there
she
paused
and
with
the
forefinger
of
her
left
hand
on
her
lips
glanced
coyly
round
at
him
she
then
quietly
turned
the
door
handle
and
signalling
to
him
to
follow
stole
into
the
room
on
tiptoe
charmed
with
this
piece
of
acting
the
na√Øvety
of
it
appealing
very
strongly
to
his
susceptible
nature
my
uncle
hastened
after
her
the
moment
he
crossed
the
threshold
however
he
recoiled
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
an
old
woman
with
a
hideous
white
face
and
black
leering
eyes
there
were
no
signs
anywhere
of
the
young
and
beautiful
lady
she
had
completely
vanished
my
uncle
was
so
shocked
by
the
spectacle
before
him
that
he
retreated
on
to
the
landing
and
as
he
did
so
the
door
swung
to
with
a
loud
crash
he
called
my
father
and
they
entered
the
room
together
but
it
was
quite
empty
the
old
hag
had
disappeared
as
inexplicably
as
the
girl
that
evening
there
was
to
be
a
party
and
the
table
in
the
groaned
beneath
the
weight
of
one
of
those
inimitable
spreads
in
vogue
some
fifty
or
sixty
years
ago
with
somewhat
pardonable
pride
my
mother
took
us
father
uncle
and
have
a
peep
at
it
before
the
guests
arrived
as
we
drew
near
the
room
we
heard
to
our
astonishment
the
plaintive
sound
of
a
spinet
my
mother
instantly
drew
back
trembling
whereupon
my
uncle
forcing
a
laugh
said
this
is
one
of
the
occasions
upon
which
a
gentleman
should
go
he
threw
open
the
door
as
he
spoke
and
we
all
peered
in
what
i
saw
will
never
be
effaced
from
my
memory
the
room
exhibited
a
complete
cloth
was
half
off
the
table
the
massive
silver
candlesticks
were
overturned
and
the
floor
was
strewn
with
piles
of
broken
glass
china
and
was
smashed
and
ruined
in
the
midst
of
the
debris
her
face
turned
towards
us
lay
a
very
beautiful
girl
there
were
unmistakable
evidences
of
a
ghastly
wound
but
her
eyes
were
partly
open
and
the
strange
light
which
gleamed
from
their
blue
depths
revealed
an
expression
which
could
only
have
been
hatched
in
hell
peopled
not
with
passive
sufferers
but
with
wholly
abandoned
beings
actively
engaged
in
licentiousness
and
everything
that
is
destructive
and
antagonistic
to
man
s
moral
and
mental
progress
standing
over
the
woman
and
holding
a
kind
of
stiletto
in
his
hand
was
a
tall
fair
man
in
whose
agonised
and
remorseful
features
we
recognised
at
once
a
most
startling
likeness
to
my
uncle
no
detail
was
was
the
deep
scar
on
the
temple
the
curiously
deep
dimple
in
the
chin
indeed
saving
for
the
clothes
no
likeness
could
have
been
more
exact
standing
by
his
side
her
hideous
scowling
face
thrust
forward
her
evil
eyes
glaring
at
us
with
the
same
vindictive
insolence
was
the
old
woman
i
had
seen
that
night
in
the
hall
then
my
father
uttering
some
exclamation
crossed
himself
and
as
he
did
so
the
figures
abruptly
vanished
whilst
the
whole
house
echoed
and
with
loud
peals
of
mocking
diabolical
laughter
that
was
the
finale
we
left
immediately
afterwards
and
from
that
day
to
this
the
house
i
believe
has
stood
almost
uninterruptedly
this
is
the
gist
of
blake
s
account
of
the
happenings
and
as
i
never
found
her
anything
but
strictly
truthful
i
believe
them
to
have
been
given
me
without
any
conscious
exaggeration
chapter
ii
i
am
pursued
by
phantom
footsteps
before
i
left
the
west
of
ireland
i
set
out
one
day
to
investigate
a
case
of
haunting
by
fairies
which
was
alleged
to
take
place
nightly
at
the
junction
of
four
cross
roads
on
the
southern
slope
of
the
wicklow
mountains
i
found
a
spot
that
seemed
to
correspond
with
the
description
of
the
scene
of
the
haunting
given
me
by
my
informant
and
kept
a
vigil
there
for
two
consecutive
nights
without
experiencing
any
of
the
anticipated
results
however
i
intended
giving
the
place
another
trial
and
accordingly
set
out
but
when
within
half
a
mile
or
so
of
my
destination
i
began
to
feel
very
tired
and
having
a
bad
cold
on
me
besides
i
decided
to
put
up
at
a
cottage
i
espied
a
short
distance
off
instead
of
pursuing
my
way
further
the
cottage
stood
a
little
back
from
the
main
road
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
or
so
and
was
connected
with
it
by
a
narrow
lane
the
situation
was
one
of
intense
loneliness
the
nearest
village
was
a
good
two
miles
away
and
few
people
other
than
occasional
cyclists
ever
passed
along
the
high
road
after
nightfall
at
the
time
i
am
speaking
of
the
cottage
was
tenanted
by
a
couple
named
mullins
the
man
was
a
drover
and
his
wife
one
of
the
tallest
women
i
have
ever
seen
she
possessed
moreover
a
pair
of
eyes
and
these
were
remarkable
not
only
for
their
curious
colouring
but
for
the
impression
they
gave
one
that
they
were
perpetually
trying
not
to
see
too
much
apart
from
these
peculiarities
she
seemed
ordinary
enough
and
i
felt
i
was
in
the
house
of
very
worthy
and
people
i
went
to
bed
early
and
was
given
the
only
spare
room
in
the
cottage
it
faced
the
front
and
was
immediately
over
the
tiny
parlour
as
the
linen
was
spotless
and
felt
thoroughly
dry
i
had
no
scruples
about
getting
in
between
the
sheets
and
stretching
myself
out
i
was
soon
fast
asleep
i
awoke
with
violent
palpitations
of
the
heart
to
find
the
room
bathed
with
moonlight
and
as
all
was
absolutely
silent
i
concluded
it
must
be
far
on
into
the
night
suddenly
i
heard
in
the
distance
running
at
a
pace
they
rang
out
sharp
and
clear
in
the
still
air
and
gradually
became
more
and
more
distinct
i
was
wondering
who
the
person
could
be
out
at
such
an
hour
when
a
dog
apparently
in
the
yard
at
the
back
of
the
house
set
up
the
most
unearthly
howling
the
next
moment
i
heard
mullins
speak
and
inadvertently
i
listened
john
she
said
do
you
hear
the
dog
i
should
be
deaf
and
dumb
if
i
didn
t
mullins
replied
sleepily
what
is
it
what
is
it
indeed
why
the
dog
never
barks
like
that
unless
there
is
a
spirit
about
do
you
remember
those
knocks
on
the
door
the
night
uncle
mike
died
and
how
the
dog
howled
then
there
s
something
of
the
same
sort
about
listen
the
steps
very
were
near
now
i
listened
intently
the
runner
i
thought
must
be
wearing
very
extraordinary
boots
for
every
step
so
it
seemed
to
me
was
accompanied
by
a
peculiar
and
almost
metallic
click
john
mullins
suddenly
resumed
do
you
hear
those
steps
what
are
they
it
s
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
ve
heard
anyone
running
along
the
high
road
like
that
at
this
time
of
night
hark
they
ve
got
to
the
re
in
the
re
coming
here
get
up
at
once
go
and
bolt
the
front
door
the
thing
s
i
m
sure
and
it
s
someone
of
us
here
it
s
the
steps
grew
rapidly
nearer
and
mullins
stumbling
hastily
down
the
stairs
bolted
both
the
doors
and
swung
to
the
little
wooden
shutters
a
moment
later
and
i
heard
the
steps
come
right
up
to
the
door
there
was
a
momentary
pause
then
a
series
of
terrific
knocks
cross
yourself
john
for
god
s
sake
cross
yourself
mullins
cried
and
may
the
holy
virgin
protect
she
then
started
praying
loudly
and
vehemently
and
whether
it
was
the
effect
of
her
prayers
or
not
the
knocking
gradually
diminished
in
violence
and
then
ceased
altogether
come
on
up
john
mullins
called
out
the
thing
whatever
it
is
has
ceased
troubling
us
and
we
may
go
to
sleep
in
mullins
needing
no
second
bidding
joined
his
wife
and
once
again
the
whole
place
was
wrapped
in
silence
i
must
confess
that
whilst
the
knocking
continued
i
had
no
desire
whatever
to
look
out
of
the
window
but
the
moment
it
was
over
i
got
up
and
peered
out
i
could
see
right
down
the
lane
and
for
some
distance
along
the
high
road
there
was
no
sign
of
anyone
or
anything
that
could
in
any
way
account
for
the
landscape
was
brilliantly
illuminated
with
moonlight
every
stick
and
stone
being
plainly
visible
and
all
nature
seemed
to
be
sleeping
undisturbedly
as
if
no
interruption
in
its
ordinary
routine
had
occurred
i
got
back
into
bed
and
falling
into
a
gentle
doze
slept
soundly
till
the
morning
after
breakfast
mullins
said
you
re
not
thinking
of
spending
another
night
here
sir
are
you
why
no
i
replied
i
must
be
back
in
dublin
at
my
work
by
this
i
m
glad
of
that
sir
she
went
on
because
i
couldn
t
let
you
stay
i
suppose
you
heard
the
rapping
sir
i
did
i
replied
and
the
do
you
account
for
them
only
in
one
way
she
said
they
came
after
you
at
least
that
was
my
impression
and
my
impressions
are
seldom
wrong
i
seemed
to
see
some
terrible
animal
and
half
indescribably
grotesque
and
my
instinct
tells
me
was
wanting
to
get
at
her
description
of
the
figure
reminded
me
so
strongly
of
the
queer
thing
that
tried
to
strangle
me
in
the
house
near
the
waterloo
road
that
i
narrated
my
experience
to
her
you
may
depend
upon
it
sir
she
said
when
i
had
finished
that
the
ghost
you
have
just
told
me
about
and
the
one
that
came
to
the
cottage
last
night
are
the
same
i
have
heard
that
spirits
will
sometimes
attach
themselves
to
persons
who
have
been
staying
in
the
house
they
haunt
and
that
they
will
leave
the
house
with
them
and
follow
them
wherever
they
go
i
only
hope
and
trust
that
this
one
will
never
do
you
any
harm
and
that
you
will
succeed
in
ridding
yourself
of
it
but
my
husband
and
i
feel
asking
your
pardon
that
we
should
not
like
to
have
you
sleep
here
i
did
not
tell
her
that
even
had
she
been
willing
nothing
on
earth
would
have
induced
me
to
stay
for
whether
she
was
right
in
her
theory
about
the
steps
or
not
the
neighbourhood
had
lost
all
its
charms
for
me
indeed
when
next
i
had
a
ghostly
visitation
i
hoped
i
should
be
quartered
in
a
less
isolated
spot
my
aunt
meta
o
donnell
tells
me
that
a
relative
of
hers
once
had
a
remarkable
encounter
with
fairies
on
the
road
between
ballinanty
and
the
village
of
hospital
in
county
limerick
he
was
driving
home
one
evening
in
his
jaunting
car
unaccompanied
save
by
his
servant
dunkley
who
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
him
when
a
number
of
little
on
the
car
and
clambering
up
tried
to
pull
him
off
finding
that
owing
to
the
vigour
with
which
they
pulled
he
was
actually
slipping
from
his
seat
he
appealed
to
his
servant
for
assistance
and
the
latter
doing
as
he
was
told
held
on
to
him
with
all
his
strength
and
thus
prevented
the
little
people
from
dragging
him
to
the
ground
meta
o
donnell
is
absolutely
sure
that
her
relative
never
took
stimulants
of
any
sort
and
that
he
was
in
a
perfectly
normal
state
of
mind
when
this
event
happened
nor
is
this
road
haunted
only
by
fairies
for
meta
o
donnell
again
tells
me
that
this
same
relative
of
hers
when
driving
home
on
another
time
with
several
a
man
on
horseback
in
a
hunting
coat
suddenly
leap
the
hedge
and
after
riding
for
some
distance
by
the
side
of
the
car
abruptly
vanish
two
of
the
men
who
were
with
him
she
believes
also
witnessed
this
phenomenon
it
is
a
long
step
seemingly
from
the
fairy
to
the
banshee
but
these
two
types
of
spirit
have
at
least
one
trait
in
common
namely
exclusiveness
and
the
banshee
even
more
emphatically
than
the
fairy
will
have
nought
to
do
with
the
alien
it
will
attach
itself
only
to
the
family
of
irish
origin
only
to
the
clan
that
has
been
associated
with
irish
soil
for
many
generations
with
the
kind
permission
of
ralph
shirley
i
will
here
introduce
making
only
slight
alterations
a
few
extracts
from
an
article
of
mine
on
the
banshee
which
appeared
in
the
occult
review
for
september
contemporary
with
fairies
and
the
feni
phantoms
typical
of
the
great
lone
hills
of
wicklow
and
connemara
and
of
the
bare
and
cliffs
of
galway
may
well
have
been
the
banshees
which
attaching
themselves
for
divers
reasons
to
various
chieftains
and
sons
of
chieftains
eventually
became
recognised
as
family
ghosts
or
familiars
many
people
have
fallen
in
the
error
of
imagining
all
banshees
are
moulded
after
one
pattern
nothing
could
be
more
fallacious
the
banshee
of
the
o
rourkes
for
example
does
not
resemble
that
of
the
o
donnells
there
are
many
forms
of
the
banshee
each
clan
having
a
distinct
more
than
its
own
some
of
the
banshees
are
fair
to
look
at
and
some
old
and
foul
and
terrifying
but
their
mission
is
invariably
the
same
to
announce
a
death
or
some
great
family
catastrophe
the
banshee
is
never
joyous
it
is
always
either
sad
or
malevolent
sometimes
it
wails
once
sometimes
three
wail
in
some
degree
but
not
altogether
resembling
that
of
a
woman
in
great
trouble
or
agony
sometimes
again
it
groans
and
sometimes
it
sighs
or
sings
in
some
clans
the
demonstrations
are
both
visual
and
auditory
in
others
only
visual
and
in
others
again
only
auditory
there
is
no
really
old
clan
but
has
its
banshee
and
few
members
of
that
clan
who
are
not
at
some
time
or
other
of
their
lives
made
aware
of
it
how
well
i
recollect
as
a
child
being
told
by
those
who
had
experienced
it
that
a
dreadful
groaning
and
wailing
had
been
heard
the
night
prior
to
the
death
of
a
very
near
relative
of
mine
in
africa
i
enquired
what
made
the
wailing
and
was
informed
the
banshee
or
the
ghost
woman
who
never
fails
to
announce
the
death
of
an
o
donnell
years
later
when
in
the
extreme
west
of
england
my
wife
and
i
were
awakened
one
night
by
a
terrible
wail
which
sounded
just
outside
our
door
beginning
in
a
low
key
it
rose
and
rose
until
it
ended
in
a
shrill
scream
that
in
time
died
away
in
a
horrible
groan
the
idea
of
the
banshee
at
once
flashed
through
my
mind
for
i
felt
none
other
but
a
banshee
could
have
made
such
a
sound
still
to
satisfy
my
wife
i
jumped
out
of
bed
and
went
on
to
the
landing
all
was
dark
and
silent
and
outside
their
bedrooms
were
assembled
the
rest
of
the
household
terrified
and
eager
to
have
an
explanation
of
what
had
happened
we
searched
the
whole
house
and
the
waste
land
outside
but
there
was
nothing
which
could
in
any
way
account
for
the
noise
and
in
the
morning
i
received
news
of
the
death
of
someone
very
closely
related
to
me
whilst
some
writers
are
inclined
to
treat
the
subject
jocularly
and
attribute
the
banshee
either
to
obviously
absurd
physical
causes
or
to
the
abnormally
imaginative
powers
they
insist
are
the
birthright
of
all
irishmen
others
dive
into
the
compilations
of
modern
theosophy
and
reappear
with
the
pronouncement
that
banshees
are
not
spirits
at
entities
hailing
from
the
superphysical
mere
thought
germs
created
by
some
remote
ancestor
of
a
clan
and
wafted
down
from
one
generation
to
another
of
his
descendants
an
idea
as
nonsensical
as
it
is
extravagant
and
which
will
not
for
an
instant
hold
water
when
looked
into
by
those
who
have
had
a
experience
of
the
banshee
or
any
other
ghostly
phenomenon
indeed
it
is
only
the
latter
who
are
capable
of
making
observations
of
any
value
on
such
a
subject
and
all
effort
to
describe
or
account
for
the
superphysical
by
those
who
have
never
experienced
it
no
matter
whether
those
efforts
are
made
by
theosophical
savants
professional
mediums
or
scientific
experts
are
in
my
opinion
weightless
colourless
and
futile
a
geologist
may
describe
the
hydrosphere
and
an
astronomer
the
moon
and
their
descriptions
may
be
swallowed
with
tolerable
composure
and
assurance
because
we
know
that
the
laws
of
similarity
and
analogy
when
applied
to
the
physical
generally
hold
good
but
no
scientist
can
teach
us
anything
about
spiritual
phenomena
because
such
things
are
actually
without
the
realm
of
science
just
as
the
game
of
marbles
is
entirely
without
the
province
of
theology
it
is
our
sensations
and
our
sensations
that
can
guide
and
instruct
us
when
dealing
with
the
superphysical
i
have
heard
the
dying
screams
of
a
woman
murdered
beneath
my
window
i
have
heard
on
hill
and
plain
the
cries
of
coyottes
panthers
jackals
and
hyenas
and
i
have
many
times
listened
to
the
dismal
hooting
of
night
birds
when
riding
alone
through
the
seclusion
of
giant
forests
but
there
is
something
in
the
banshee
s
cry
that
differs
from
all
these
that
fills
one
with
a
fear
and
awe
that
produced
by
a
sound
which
is
merely
physical
imagine
then
what
it
is
to
be
haunted
all
one
s
life
by
such
a
grim
harbinger
of
woe
to
have
it
ever
trailing
in
one
s
wake
always
ready
and
maybe
eager
to
make
itself
heard
the
moment
it
detects
by
its
extraordinary
and
unhuman
powers
the
advent
of
death
one
curious
idiosyncrasy
of
the
banshee
is
that
it
never
manifests
itself
to
the
person
whose
death
it
is
prognosticating
other
people
may
see
or
hear
it
but
the
doomed
one
never
so
that
when
every
one
present
is
aware
of
it
but
one
the
fate
of
that
one
may
be
regarded
as
pretty
well
certain
and
now
once
again
whence
comes
the
banshee
from
heaven
or
from
hell
what
is
it
it
is
impossible
to
say
at
the
most
one
can
only
speculate
some
banshees
appear
to
be
mournful
only
others
unquestionably
malevolent
and
whereas
some
very
closely
resemble
a
woman
even
though
of
a
type
long
passed
away
others
again
differ
so
much
from
our
conception
of
any
human
being
that
we
can
only
imagine
them
to
be
spirits
that
never
have
been
human
that
belong
to
a
genus
wholly
separate
and
distinct
from
the
human
genus
and
that
have
only
been
brought
into
contact
with
this
material
plane
through
the
medium
of
certain
magical
or
spiritual
rites
practised
by
the
milesians
but
for
some
unknown
reason
discontinued
by
their
descendants
this
appears
to
me
quite
a
possible
explanation
of
the
origin
of
the
banshee
one
realizes
when
dabbling
in
spiritualism
one
of
the
greatest
dangers
incurred
is
that
of
attracting
to
one
certain
undesirable
mischievous
and
malignant
them
elementals
if
you
when
so
attracted
stick
to
one
like
the
proverbial
leech
and
what
happens
may
very
well
have
happened
thousands
of
years
ago
in
all
probability
the
unknown
never
changes
its
ways
and
habits
may
be
as
constant
as
those
of
nature
guided
by
laws
and
principles
which
may
at
times
vary
but
which
nevertheless
undergo
no
material
alteration
the
superphysical
attracted
to
the
ancients
as
it
is
attracted
to
us
would
adhere
to
them
as
it
now
adheres
to
us
i
can
not
surmise
more
supposing
then
that
this
theory
accounts
for
the
one
class
of
banshee
what
accounts
for
the
other
that
so
nearly
tallies
with
the
physical
are
the
latter
actual
phantoms
of
the
dead
of
those
that
died
some
unnatural
death
and
have
been
and
ever
since
maybe
they
are
maybe
they
are
the
spirits
of
women
prehistoric
or
otherwise
who
were
either
suicides
or
were
murdered
or
who
themselves
committed
some
very
heinous
offence
and
they
haunt
the
clan
to
which
they
owed
their
unhappy
ending
or
in
the
event
of
themselves
being
the
malefactors
the
clan
to
which
they
belonged
from
all
this
we
can
conclude
that
whilst
the
origin
and
constitution
of
banshees
vary
their
mission
is
always
the
are
solely
the
prognosticators
of
misfortune
a
sorry
possession
for
anyone
and
yet
how
truly
in
accord
with
the
nature
of
the
its
general
air
of
discontent
and
barrenness
with
its
soil
and
gloomy
an
unkind
critic
might
say
could
anyone
imagine
the
presence
of
cheerful
spirits
under
such
conditions
but
the
banshee
has
the
one
admirable
trait
which
the
average
englishman
obstinately
refuses
to
recognize
in
the
material
trait
of
loyalty
and
constancy
it
never
forsakes
the
object
of
its
attachment
but
clings
to
it
in
all
its
vicissitudes
and
peregrinations
with
a
loyalty
and
persistency
that
is
unmatchable
it
is
thoroughly
irish
essentially
irish
the
one
thing
apart
from
disposition
and
character
that
has
remained
exclusively
irish
through
long
centuries
of
robbery
and
oppression
and
which
in
spite
of
assertions
to
the
contrary
never
has
been
nor
ever
will
be
shared
by
other
than
the
genuine
clansman
the
banshee
is
most
fastidious
in
its
will
have
none
of
the
none
of
the
individual
who
possessing
an
absolutely
english
name
and
coming
entirely
of
english
forefathers
terms
himself
irish
merely
because
his
ancestors
happen
to
have
settled
in
ireland
that
is
nothing
like
exact
enough
for
the
banshee
others
may
talk
of
it
and
write
of
it
but
they
can
never
honestly
claim
it
for
the
banshee
belongs
wholly
and
exclusively
to
the
o
s
and
them
and
them
only
will
it
never
cease
to
haunt
so
long
as
there
is
one
of
them
my
last
experience
with
a
ghost
in
dublin
took
place
just
after
i
had
been
medically
examined
for
the
and
to
my
intense
grief
had
been
rejected
owing
to
varicose
veins
which
the
examining
doctor
told
me
were
of
a
far
too
complicated
nature
to
permit
of
an
operation
consequently
although
i
had
been
cramming
for
two
years
and
my
prospects
of
getting
through
the
literary
examination
were
deemed
extremely
fair
it
was
futile
to
go
up
for
it
as
all
chance
of
my
ever
being
in
the
was
now
at
an
end
on
the
night
of
my
failure
to
pass
the
medical
i
had
gone
to
bed
early
as
i
had
a
splitting
headache
and
after
vain
efforts
had
at
length
succeeded
in
falling
asleep
i
awoke
just
in
time
to
hear
a
clock
from
somewhere
in
the
downstairs
premises
of
the
was
then
lodging
in
lower
merrion
two
and
almost
immediately
afterwards
there
came
a
loud
laugh
just
over
my
face
and
so
near
to
me
that
i
seemed
to
feel
the
breath
of
the
laughter
fan
my
nostrils
nothing
i
have
ever
heard
before
or
have
ever
heard
since
was
so
repulsive
as
that
was
the
very
incarnation
of
jeering
jibing
mockery
of
undying
inveterate
hate
i
felt
that
nothing
but
a
spirit
of
unadulterated
evil
could
have
made
such
a
noise
and
that
it
had
come
to
gloat
over
my
let
me
know
how
greatly
it
rejoiced
at
the
cruel
blow
i
had
suffered
i
naturally
associated
it
with
the
ghost
that
had
tried
to
strangle
me
and
my
heart
turned
sick
within
me
at
the
thought
that
such
a
horrible
species
of
phantasm
was
still
hovering
near
me
should
i
ever
be
free
from
it
i
was
not
quite
so
frightened
however
as
i
had
been
on
the
occasion
of
its
visit
to
me
in
the
house
near
the
waterloo
road
and
determining
to
prevent
myself
from
falling
into
that
kind
of
paralytic
condition
again
in
which
all
my
muscles
and
faculties
had
remained
alike
and
useless
i
sat
up
the
room
was
in
pitch
darkness
and
everything
was
breathlessly
still
i
waited
in
this
posture
for
some
seconds
my
heart
beating
like
a
and
then
deriving
assurance
from
the
fact
that
nothing
happened
i
got
out
of
bed
and
struck
a
light
the
door
was
locked
on
the
inside
and
there
was
nothing
in
hiding
that
could
in
any
way
account
for
the
noise
i
went
to
the
window
and
lifting
it
gently
peered
out
into
the
street
there
was
no
moon
but
many
stars
and
enabled
me
to
see
that
the
street
was
absolutely
even
a
policeman
was
in
sight
i
leaned
far
out
and
from
immediately
beneath
me
although
no
one
was
visible
there
suddenly
commenced
the
sound
of
running
footsteps
ringing
out
loud
and
clear
and
accompanied
by
a
queer
familiar
clicking
they
seemed
to
follow
the
direction
of
the
street
towards
ely
place
i
wanted
to
get
back
to
bed
for
i
was
lightly
clad
and
the
air
was
cool
and
penetrating
but
something
compelled
me
to
keep
on
listening
and
so
i
remained
with
my
neck
craned
over
the
till
the
steps
gradually
grew
fainter
and
fainter
and
suddenly
ceased
altogether
and
with
their
termination
this
early
period
of
my
ghostly
experiences
in
dublin
terminated
too

to
and
from
dublin
and
bristol
with
as
many
passengers
and
cattle
as
could
be
crammed
with
any
degree
of
safety
into
her
dingy
and
hulk
i
remember
the
passage
well
for
two
of
my
fellow
students
were
on
board
and
we
spent
nearly
all
the
time
on
deck
telling
ghost
tales
and
earnestly
discussing
the
possibility
of
a
future
life
in
the
end
we
made
a
solemn
compact
whereby
it
was
agreed
that
the
one
who
died
first
would
try
his
level
best
to
give
some
kind
of
spirit
demonstration
to
the
other
two
both
my
friends
died
within
a
few
years
of
that
date
and
within
three
weeks
of
each
other
the
one
who
had
a
commission
in
a
cavalry
regiment
was
killed
at
the
battle
of
omdurman
and
the
other
who
having
followed
in
the
footsteps
of
his
distinguished
father
had
become
a
novelist
of
great
promise
was
kicked
to
death
by
a
horse
the
day
after
the
death
of
the
former
as
i
was
busily
engaged
writing
the
first
chapter
of
my
novel
for
satan
s
sake
a
portion
of
the
in
the
room
in
which
i
was
working
suddenly
fell
with
a
loud
crash
on
to
the
grate
of
course
the
incident
may
not
have
had
anything
to
do
with
the
death
of
my
friend
but
it
was
nevertheless
remarkable
as
previously
nothing
in
the
nature
of
a
flaw
had
been
noticeable
in
the
condition
of
the
my
other
friend
i
subsequently
learned
after
the
incident
i
am
about
to
narrate
had
ten
o
clock
one
friday
morning
and
that
afternoon
as
i
was
changing
for
football
the
grandfather
clock
on
the
landing
outside
my
bedroom
suddenly
struck
ten
i
went
to
look
and
the
hands
pointed
to
three
there
had
been
nothing
amiss
with
the
striking
before
and
there
was
nothing
amiss
with
the
striking
after
these
were
the
only
phenomena
i
experienced
at
the
time
these
two
friends
of
mine
died
on
arriving
at
bristol
i
spent
some
weeks
in
the
west
of
england
and
then
journeyed
north
to
scotland
my
original
intention
had
been
to
spend
a
few
weeks
with
an
old
clifton
friend
of
mine
whose
father
owned
an
estate
near
inverary
but
on
arriving
at
glasgow
i
heard
of
such
a
promising
case
of
haunting
in
that
city
that
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
of
investigating
it
i
decided
to
postpone
my
journey
west
the
case
as
outlined
to
me
in
the
first
instance
was
this
a
glasgow
solicitor
named
james
mckaye
desirous
of
taking
a
house
close
to
his
office
went
one
morning
to
look
at
one
in
duke
street
he
went
there
alone
and
carefully
closing
the
front
door
behind
him
proceeded
to
wander
from
room
to
room
beginning
with
the
basement
as
he
was
going
upstairs
to
the
first
floor
he
suddenly
heard
footsteps
following
him
he
turned
sharply
round
there
was
no
one
there
thinking
this
was
odd
but
attributing
it
to
the
acoustic
properties
of
the
walls
he
continued
his
ascent
having
arrived
on
the
first
landing
he
went
into
one
of
the
rooms
the
steps
followed
him
a
brilliant
idea
then
occurred
to
stamped
his
foot
there
was
no
echo
he
turned
round
and
went
into
the
next
room
and
the
steps
once
again
accompanied
him
then
he
grew
frightened
it
was
broad
daylight
the
sun
was
shining
brilliantly
and
the
birds
were
singing
but
there
was
something
in
this
house
that
jarred
on
him
something
that
was
completely
out
of
humour
with
the
golden
sunbeams
and
the
cheerful
chirping
of
the
sparrows
the
day
was
hot
and
the
sun
was
pouring
in
through
the
blindless
windows
but
in
spite
of
this
the
rooms
were
icy
and
he
was
deliberating
whether
it
was
worth
while
to
explore
the
house
further
when
he
caught
sight
of
a
shadow
on
the
wall
it
was
not
his
own
shadow
it
was
that
of
a
man
with
his
arms
stretched
out
horizontally
on
either
side
of
him
and
whereas
the
right
arm
was
complete
in
every
detail
the
left
had
no
hand
james
mckaye
now
yielded
to
an
ungovernable
terror
and
rushed
frantically
out
of
the
house
one
would
naturally
think
that
after
all
this
mckaye
would
have
vowed
never
to
go
near
the
place
again
nothing
of
the
sort
the
house
fascinated
him
he
could
not
get
it
out
of
his
mind
he
even
dreamed
of
it
dreamed
of
it
in
connection
with
some
mystery
that
he
must
he
alone
could
solve
besides
there
was
not
another
house
in
the
town
so
conveniently
situated
nor
so
cheap
consequently
he
took
it
and
within
a
fortnight
had
moved
in
with
all
his
family
and
household
goods
for
the
first
few
weeks
everything
went
swimmingly
and
mckaye
who
was
shrewd
even
for
a
scot
congratulated
himself
upon
having
made
such
an
excellent
bargain
then
occurred
an
incident
which
recalled
sharply
the
day
he
had
first
seen
the
place
he
was
writing
some
letters
one
morning
in
his
study
when
the
entered
white
and
agitated
oh
do
come
to
the
nursery
sir
she
implored
the
children
are
playing
with
something
that
looks
like
a
dog
and
yet
isn
t
one
i
don
t
know
what
it
is
and
she
burst
out
crying
you
re
mad
mckaye
said
sharply
and
springing
to
his
feet
he
ran
upstairs
on
reaching
the
nursery
the
blurred
outline
of
something
like
a
huge
dog
or
wolf
came
out
of
the
door
and
raced
past
him
so
close
that
he
distinctly
felt
it
brush
against
his
clothes
where
it
went
he
could
not
say
he
was
thinking
of
the
children
and
did
not
stop
to
look
oddly
enough
the
children
were
not
a
bit
afraid
on
the
contrary
they
were
pleased
and
curious
what
a
strange
doggy
it
was
daddy
they
cried
it
never
wagged
its
tail
like
other
doggies
and
whenever
we
tried
to
stroke
it
it
slipped
away
from
never
touched
it
sorely
puzzled
mckaye
told
his
wife
and
the
two
decided
that
if
anything
further
happened
they
must
leave
the
house
that
night
mckaye
happened
to
sit
up
rather
late
at
last
he
got
up
and
was
about
to
turn
off
the
gas
when
he
felt
his
upstretched
hand
suddenly
caught
hold
of
by
something
large
and
soft
that
did
not
seem
to
have
any
fingers
he
was
so
frightened
that
he
screamed
whereupon
his
hand
was
instantly
released
and
there
was
a
loud
crash
overhead
thinking
something
had
happened
to
his
wife
he
rushed
upstairs
and
found
her
sitting
up
in
bed
and
talking
in
her
sleep
she
was
apparently
addressing
a
black
shadowy
figure
that
was
crouching
on
the
floor
opposite
her
as
mckaye
approached
the
thing
moved
towards
the
wall
and
vanished
mckaye
then
awoke
and
begged
her
husband
to
take
her
out
of
the
house
at
once
as
she
had
dreamed
most
vividly
that
an
appalling
murder
had
been
committed
there
and
that
the
murderer
had
come
out
of
the
room
with
outstretched
hands
asking
her
to
look
at
them
mckaye
who
had
had
quite
enough
of
it
too
promised
to
do
as
she
wished
and
before
another
hours
had
passed
the
house
was
once
again
empty
these
were
the
bare
facts
of
the
case
and
as
they
were
given
me
by
one
of
his
clients
i
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
an
interview
with
mckaye
who
i
was
told
still
had
the
keys
of
the
house
it
was
not
however
so
easy
to
obtain
consent
to
spend
a
night
on
the
premises
and
he
would
only
permit
me
to
do
so
on
the
condition
that
he
himself
accompanied
me
and
that
i
promised
to
keep
the
visit
a
profound
secret
the
evening
chosen
for
our
enterprise
proved
ever
memorable
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
and
the
veritable
any
attempt
to
hold
up
an
umbrella
utterly
impossible
indeed
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
hold
up
myself
whilst
to
add
to
my
discomfort
at
almost
every
step
i
plunged
in
icy
cold
puddles
at
length
drenched
to
the
skin
i
arrived
at
the
house
mckaye
was
standing
on
the
doorstep
swearing
furiously
he
could
not
so
he
said
find
the
key
however
he
produced
it
now
and
we
were
soon
standing
inside
shaking
the
water
from
our
clothes
those
were
the
days
before
pocket
flashlights
had
become
general
and
we
had
to
be
content
with
candles
we
each
lighted
one
and
at
once
commenced
to
search
the
premises
to
make
sure
no
one
was
in
hiding
the
house
as
far
as
i
can
recollect
consisted
of
four
storeys
and
a
basement
none
of
the
rooms
were
very
large
the
were
hideous
and
i
remember
thanking
my
stars
that
i
was
not
called
upon
to
live
in
such
hopelessly
inartistic
quarters
mckaye
asked
me
if
i
could
detect
anything
peculiar
in
the
atmosphere
but
i
could
only
detect
extreme
mustiness
and
told
him
so
i
fancied
he
seemed
very
fidgety
and
ill
at
ease
however
as
he
was
a
much
older
man
than
myself
and
had
some
experience
of
the
house
i
felt
perfectly
safe
with
him
after
we
had
been
in
all
the
rooms
we
descended
to
the
ground
floor
and
commenced
our
vigil
on
the
staircase
leading
from
the
hall
to
the
first
landing
i
think
we
stand
more
chance
of
seeing
something
here
than
anywhere
else
mckaye
said
and
in
the
case
of
anything
very
alarming
happening
we
are
close
to
the
front
illustration
we
both
looked
in
the
direction
he
indicated
he
spoke
only
half
in
fun
and
i
observed
that
his
fingers
twitched
a
good
deal
and
that
his
eyes
were
never
at
rest
oughtn
t
we
to
put
out
the
candles
i
said
ghosts
surely
materialise
much
more
readily
in
the
but
he
would
not
hear
of
it
all
his
experiences
he
said
had
taken
place
in
the
light
and
he
believed
only
spoof
ghosts
at
s√©ances
required
the
opposite
conditions
then
he
regaled
me
once
more
with
all
that
had
happened
during
his
occupation
of
the
house
he
was
still
telling
me
when
there
came
a
loud
at
the
door
that
s
a
policeman
he
said
he
must
have
seen
our
he
spoke
truly
for
when
we
opened
the
door
a
burly
figure
in
helmet
and
cape
stood
on
the
step
and
flashed
his
dripping
bull
in
our
faces
on
hearing
mckaye
s
name
the
constable
was
instantly
appeased
and
when
we
mentioned
ghosts
he
laughed
long
and
loud
well
gentlemen
he
said
you
won
t
never
be
alarmed
by
a
happarition
so
long
as
you
have
that
dog
with
you
i
bet
he
would
scare
away
any
number
of
ghosts
and
burglars
too
if
i
may
be
so
bold
as
to
ask
what
breed
do
you
call
him
i
ve
never
seen
anything
quite
like
him
before
and
he
waved
his
lamp
towards
the
stairs
we
both
looked
in
the
direction
he
indicated
and
there
half
way
up
the
stairs
with
its
face
apparently
turned
towards
us
was
the
black
shadowy
outline
of
some
shaggy
creature
which
to
me
looked
not
so
much
like
a
dog
as
a
bear
it
remained
stationary
for
a
moment
or
so
and
then
retreating
backwards
seemed
to
disappear
into
the
wall
well
gentlemen
the
policeman
said
lowering
his
lamp
it
s
time
i
was
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
was
walking
off
when
mckaye
called
him
back
wait
a
moment
constable
he
said
and
we
ll
come
with
he
cast
a
swiftly
furtive
glance
around
him
as
he
spoke
then
blowing
out
the
lights
he
caught
me
by
the
arm
and
dragged
me
away
but
the
dog
sir
the
policeman
said
as
the
front
door
closed
behind
us
with
a
bang
it
ain
t
come
out
and
it
never
will
mckaye
responded
grimly
you
have
seen
the
ghost
constable
or
at
least
one
of
i
have
never
had
an
opportunity
of
visiting
the
house
again
but
for
aught
i
know
to
the
contrary
it
still
stands
there
and
is
still
haunted
from
glasgow
i
went
on
to
inverary
where
i
had
the
most
delightful
time
fishing
and
shooting
i
then
went
to
perth
and
there
quite
by
chance
met
a
and
rowlandson
who
informed
me
that
they
were
just
quitting
a
badly
haunted
house
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
the
name
of
the
house
was
it
was
their
own
and
had
only
been
built
a
year
but
they
could
not
possibly
remain
in
it
they
told
me
owing
to
the
perpetual
disturbance
to
which
they
were
subjected
they
were
just
beginning
a
detailed
description
of
the
manifestations
when
i
begged
them
to
desist
i
would
like
i
explained
with
their
permission
to
investigate
the
case
and
i
thought
it
would
be
better
to
do
so
without
knowing
the
nature
of
the
hauntings
as
in
these
my
experience
happen
to
tally
with
could
be
no
question
either
of
suggestion
or
of
imagination
i
had
resolved
to
conduct
all
my
investigations
with
an
absolutely
open
mind
and
i
intended
when
once
i
had
satisfied
myself
that
the
phenomena
were
objective
to
try
and
alight
upon
some
code
whereby
i
could
communicate
with
them
and
learn
from
them
something
definite
at
all
events
about
the
other
world
to
what
extent
i
have
succeeded
i
shall
make
it
the
purpose
of
this
volume
to
reveal
but
to
continue
what
strikes
us
as
so
extraordinary
about
the
whole
thing
the
rowlandsons
said
is
that
a
new
house
with
absolutely
no
history
attached
to
it
for
we
were
the
first
people
who
ever
inhabited
it
and
we
can
assure
you
they
added
laughingly
there
were
no
murders
or
suicides
there
during
our
occupancy
should
be
haunted
our
neighbours
declare
that
we
must
have
brought
the
ghost
with
i
told
them
i
thought
it
quite
possible
that
such
might
be
the
case
and
narrated
to
them
my
experiences
in
dublin
they
appeared
to
be
greatly
interested
and
were
moreover
quite
willing
provided
i
promised
them
not
to
discuss
the
matter
too
openly
as
they
wanted
to
let
the
house
that
i
should
spend
a
few
nights
at
they
were
in
fact
rather
anxious
to
know
if
anything
unusual
still
took
place
there
thinking
perhaps
that
i
might
not
like
to
go
alone
they
gave
me
an
introduction
to
a
young
friend
of
theirs
swinton
who
they
thought
might
be
prevailed
upon
to
accompany
me
and
before
i
left
them
all
the
preliminaries
relating
to
my
visit
to
bocarthe
were
satisfactorily
arranged
that
same
day
the
rowlandsons
went
to
edinburgh
where
they
told
me
they
intended
living
and
the
following
day
at
noon
i
wended
my
way
to
the
house
they
had
vacated
as
there
was
no
story
connected
with
bocarthe
i
set
to
work
to
make
enquiries
about
the
ground
on
which
it
stood
and
instead
of
learning
too
little
i
learned
too
much
an
old
minister
who
looked
fully
eighty
was
sure
that
the
ground
in
question
until
it
was
built
upon
quite
recently
had
been
grazing
land
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
and
that
it
had
never
witnessed
anything
more
extraordinary
than
the
occasional
death
of
a
sheep
or
a
cow
that
had
been
struck
by
lightning
an
equally
aged
and
equally
positive
postmistress
declared
that
the
ground
had
never
been
anything
better
than
waste
land
where
amid
rubbish
heaps
galore
all
the
dogs
in
the
parish
might
have
been
seen
scratching
and
fighting
over
bones
another
person
remembered
a
pond
being
there
and
another
a
nursery
garden
but
from
no
one
could
i
extract
the
slightest
hint
as
to
anything
that
could
in
any
way
account
for
the
haunting
when
i
entered
the
house
i
thought
i
had
seldom
seen
such
a
cheerful
one
the
rooms
were
light
and
lofty
and
about
them
all
there
was
an
air
of
geniality
that
hitherto
at
all
events
i
had
never
dreamed
of
associating
with
ghosts
swinton
joined
me
in
the
evening
but
although
we
sat
up
till
long
after
dawn
we
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
we
could
not
account
for
by
natural
causes
we
repeated
the
process
for
two
more
nights
and
then
feeling
that
we
had
given
the
house
a
fair
trial
we
concluded
it
was
either
no
longer
haunted
or
that
the
hauntings
were
periodical
and
might
not
occur
again
for
years
i
wrote
to
rowlandson
upon
returning
the
keys
of
the
house
and
in
reply
received
the
following
letter
from
him
no
crescent
edinburgh
november
dear
o
donnell
many
thanks
for
the
keys
no
wonder
you
did
not
see
our
ghost
it
is
here
and
we
are
having
just
the
same
experiences
in
this
house
as
we
had
in
if
you
would
care
to
stay
a
few
nights
with
us
on
the
chance
of
seeing
the
ghost
we
shall
be
delighted
to
put
you
up
yours
robert
rowlandson
i
was
obliged
to
return
home
very
shortly
in
order
to
decide
definitely
and
speedily
what
i
intended
to
do
for
a
living
but
although
i
knew
i
had
little
or
no
time
to
waste
i
could
not
resist
the
rowlandsons
kind
invitation
to
try
and
see
their
ghost
and
accordingly
accepted
they
lived
in
crescent
when
i
arrived
there
i
found
the
entire
household
in
a
panic
the
ghost
having
appeared
to
one
and
all
during
the
previous
night
it
was
so
terrible
rowlandson
said
that
i
can
t
bear
even
to
think
of
it
and
shall
certainly
never
forget
it
one
of
the
maids
fainted
and
was
so
ill
afterwards
we
were
obliged
to
have
the
doctor
and
all
have
given
notice
to
did
nothing
of
the
sort
happen
before
you
went
to
bocarthe
i
ventured
to
ask
no
rowlandson
replied
not
a
thing
we
were
then
sceptics
where
ghosts
were
concerned
but
we
re
certainly
not
sceptical
do
you
think
it
possible
i
said
that
the
ghost
is
attached
to
some
piece
of
old
furniture
i
have
read
of
such
rowlandson
shook
his
head
no
he
said
we
have
no
old
furniture
all
our
furniture
is
modern
and
new
at
least
it
was
new
when
we
came
to
then
if
the
ghost
is
neither
attached
to
the
house
nor
to
the
ground
nor
to
the
furniture
it
must
surely
be
attached
to
some
person
i
remarked
i
have
read
that
one
of
the
dangers
of
attending
spiritualistic
s√©ances
is
that
spirits
occasionally
attach
themselves
to
people
and
can
only
be
got
rid
of
with
great
difficulty
i
suppose
no
one
in
the
house
has
gone
in
for
spiritualism
i
can
safely
say
i
haven
t
rowlandson
laughed
and
you
haven
t
either
maud
have
you
he
said
looking
at
his
wife
rowlandson
flushed
the
only
spiritualist
i
ever
knew
she
stammered
know
dear
whom
i
rowlandson
raised
his
eyebrows
and
stared
at
her
in
astonishment
i
don
t
he
said
who
ernest
dekon
dekon
rowlandson
ejaculated
dekon
why
of
course
i
might
have
guessed
spiritualism
was
in
his
line
some
years
ago
o
donnell
he
went
on
turning
to
me
my
wife
met
this
dekon
at
a
ball
given
by
a
mutual
friend
and
from
that
time
up
to
his
death
he
persecuted
her
with
his
undesirable
attentions
i
never
knew
anyone
so
he
resented
your
marriage
of
course
i
remarked
resented
it
rowlandson
responded
i
should
rather
think
he
did
though
to
everyone
s
surprise
he
came
to
it
ye
gods
i
shall
never
forget
the
expression
on
his
face
as
we
caught
sight
of
him
in
the
vestibule
of
the
church
talk
about
satan
satan
never
looked
half
as
and
dekon
was
a
spiritualist
i
said
he
was
very
keen
on
s√©ances
rowlandson
interposed
most
keen
and
was
at
one
time
always
trying
to
persuade
me
to
go
to
one
with
i
never
knew
that
rowlandson
exclaimed
perhaps
not
his
wife
said
demurely
you
see
you
don
t
know
everything
however
i
never
and
how
did
he
die
i
ventured
suicide
rowlandson
said
he
shot
himself
and
was
dastardly
enough
to
leave
a
note
behind
him
pinned
to
the
of
his
stating
that
his
death
was
entirely
due
to
the
heartless
conduct
of
my
when
was
that
rowlandson
i
asked
let
me
see
rowlandson
soliloquised
we
have
been
married
not
quite
eighteen
months
about
fifteen
months
before
we
came
to
i
know
what
s
in
your
mind
rowlandson
observed
you
think
that
very
possibly
it
is
the
spirit
of
ernest
dekon
that
is
troubling
us
do
you
really
think
it
could
be
from
what
you
have
told
me
i
said
i
should
say
that
it
is
more
than
likely
the
mere
fact
of
his
having
been
a
spiritualist
would
mean
that
he
had
in
some
measure
got
in
touch
with
the
unknown
so
that
on
passing
over
with
his
mind
solely
concentrated
on
revenge
he
would
in
all
probability
speedily
become
closer
acquainted
with
those
spirits
whom
he
had
known
a
very
high
class
but
apparently
the
only
class
that
a
s√©ance
can
these
would
undoubtedly
aid
him
in
his
attempt
to
come
back
and
annoy
rowlandson
gave
vent
to
an
exclamation
of
dismay
i
have
always
felt
she
said
that
there
might
be
some
mysterious
connection
between
ernest
dekon
and
the
dreadful
thing
we
have
of
course
i
added
that
is
only
a
suggestion
on
my
part
when
does
the
phenomenon
usually
appear
at
all
times
and
when
we
least
expect
it
rowlandson
said
for
example
if
i
am
going
upstairs
alone
it
either
springs
out
at
me
or
peers
down
at
me
from
over
the
banisters
or
again
it
rouses
us
in
the
middle
of
the
night
by
rocking
our
bed
always
some
alarming
trick
of
that
then
you
could
hardly
expect
it
to
manifest
itself
if
we
all
sat
here
in
the
dark
you
haven
t
a
photograph
of
dekon
i
suppose
i
hazarded
a
photograph
of
that
scoundrel
rowlandson
cried
if
he
had
given
her
one
it
wouldn
t
have
remained
long
in
her
possession
i
can
assure
well
he
never
did
rowlandson
said
forcing
a
smile
but
i
can
describe
i
don
t
know
whether
that
will
do
much
good
i
observed
because
i
understand
that
if
one
of
the
lower
order
of
earthbounds
usually
called
elementals
wanted
to
fool
us
it
could
easily
impersonate
him
dekon
s
phantom
would
not
of
necessity
be
very
like
his
material
body
it
would
depend
entirely
on
how
much
of
the
animal
there
was
in
him
if
a
great
deal
then
one
might
expect
to
see
a
creature
with
a
pig
s
or
some
other
kind
of
beast
s
head
with
only
a
slight
facial
resemblance
to
dekon
can
you
describe
his
hands
because
i
believe
spirits
that
have
lost
all
other
resemblance
with
the
physical
body
might
be
identified
by
some
peculiarity
in
the
formation
of
the
yes
rowlandson
said
i
do
remember
his
hands
distinctly
they
were
so
ugly
they
were
long
and
red
and
the
tips
were
i
am
sure
i
should
recognise
them
this
conversation
took
place
in
the
interval
between
tea
and
dinner
after
dinner
we
sat
in
the
discussing
plans
for
the
night
and
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
when
came
we
should
retire
to
our
respective
rooms
and
sit
there
in
the
dark
waiting
and
watching
for
whatever
might
happen
it
was
furthermore
agreed
that
directly
anyone
saw
or
heard
anything
they
should
at
once
summon
the
others
we
sat
up
rather
late
and
it
was
close
on
midnight
before
rowlandson
rose
and
we
were
two
guests
besides
myself
a
colonel
and
our
candlesticks
and
followed
her
upstairs
we
had
mounted
the
first
flight
and
had
turned
the
bend
leading
to
the
house
seemed
all
rowlandson
halted
and
looking
back
at
us
said
hush
do
you
hear
anything
we
stood
still
and
listened
there
was
a
thump
that
apparently
came
from
a
room
just
at
the
top
of
the
then
a
very
curious
sound
as
if
something
was
bounding
backwards
and
forwards
over
bare
boards
with
its
feet
tied
together
at
a
signal
from
rowlandson
we
immediately
blew
out
our
lights
a
church
clock
solemnly
struck
twelve
we
heard
it
very
distinctly
as
the
rowlandsons
being
enthusiasts
for
fresh
air
kept
every
window
in
the
house
wide
open
the
reverberation
of
the
final
stroke
had
hardly
ceased
when
a
loud
gasp
from
someone
in
front
of
me
sent
a
chilly
feeling
down
my
spine
at
the
same
moment
the
darkness
ahead
of
us
was
dissipated
by
a
faint
luminous
glow
as
i
watched
the
glow
speedily
intensified
and
suddenly
took
the
shape
of
a
cylindrical
column
of
six
or
seven
feet
in
height
and
this
in
turn
developed
with
startling
abruptness
into
the
form
of
something
so
shockingly
grotesque
and
bestial
that
i
was
rendered
speechless
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
give
a
very
accurate
description
of
it
because
like
the
generality
of
occult
phenomena
i
have
experienced
in
haunted
houses
it
was
a
baffling
mixture
of
the
distinct
and
yet
vague
entirely
without
substance
and
apparently
wholly
constituted
of
vibrating
light
that
varied
each
second
in
tone
and
intensity
i
can
only
say
that
the
impression
i
derived
was
that
of
a
very
gross
or
monstrous
man
the
head
on
the
crown
and
sides
appeared
to
be
abnormally
high
and
long
and
to
be
covered
with
a
tangled
mass
of
coarse
hair
the
nose
seemed
hooked
the
mouth
cruel
the
eyes
leering
the
general
expression
on
the
face
was
one
of
intense
antagonism
the
body
of
the
thing
was
grey
and
nude
very
like
the
trunk
of
a
silver
beech
the
arms
long
and
knotted
the
hands
huge
the
fingers
red
and
the
latter
corresponded
exactly
with
rowlandson
s
description
this
hideous
baleful
apparition
was
the
spirit
of
animal
man
the
symbolical
representation
of
all
carnal
was
ernest
but
although
this
spirit
was
without
substance
it
was
composed
of
complex
both
physical
and
mental
it
could
shut
and
open
doors
move
furniture
rap
and
make
sundry
other
noises
and
it
could
also
convey
the
sensation
of
intense
cold
and
the
feeling
of
the
most
abject
fear
i
now
found
myself
wondering
if
it
possessed
other
properties
was
it
sensible
could
it
communicate
in
any
way
i
was
thus
deliberating
when
the
figure
seemed
to
move
forward
then
someone
shrieked
rowlandson
struck
a
light
and
simultaneously
the
apparition
vanished
the
effect
it
had
had
on
us
all
was
novel
and
were
all
more
or
less
demoralized
and
yet
no
two
of
us
had
seen
the
ghost
the
some
rowlandson
and
rushworth
had
not
seen
it
at
all
we
went
back
again
into
the
and
discussed
it
rowlandson
was
the
first
to
speak
she
too
had
been
particularly
impressed
by
the
hands
and
she
was
sure
they
were
the
hands
of
ernest
dekon
i
can
say
nothing
about
the
face
she
cried
as
it
did
not
appear
to
me
but
having
seen
the
hands
i
am
firmly
convinced
that
the
ghost
is
ernest
dekon
and
that
it
is
ernest
dekon
who
is
tormenting
us
can
t
any
of
you
think
of
a
plan
to
get
rid
of
him
cremation
is
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
cried
colonel
rushworth
who
had
hitherto
been
silent
that
is
the
means
employed
i
believe
by
the
hill
tribes
in
northern
india
when
a
spirit
they
can
to
haunt
a
place
they
dig
up
the
body
and
burn
it
and
they
say
that
as
soon
as
the
last
bone
is
consumed
the
haunting
ceases
they
have
a
theory
that
phantoms
of
dead
people
and
animals
can
materialise
as
long
as
some
remnant
of
their
physical
body
remains
where
did
this
ernest
dekon
die
in
africa
rowlandson
said
that
s
capital
if
we
can
find
the
cemetery
there
ought
to
be
no
difficulty
in
getting
at
the
body
the
officials
are
as
a
rule
open
to
bribery
anyhow
we
might
try
it
as
an
i
left
edinburgh
next
day
but
i
heard
some
months
later
from
rowlandson
you
may
recollect
colonel
rushworth
s
suggestion
he
wrote
well
the
hauntings
have
ceased
we
are
shortly
returning
to
bocarthe
from
this
i
gathered
that
an
attempt
to
exhume
and
cremate
ernest
dekon
s
body
had
been
made
and
had
proved
successful
chapter
iv
i
travel
across
the
united
states
and
do
some
ghost
hunting
in
san
francisco
upon
leaving
scotland
i
seriously
considered
my
future
and
at
length
decided
to
go
to
oregon
and
fruit
farm
though
the
expedition
through
no
fault
of
my
own
proved
a
failure
and
i
had
to
return
to
england
within
a
comparatively
short
time
i
managed
whilst
in
america
to
see
and
learn
a
good
deal
apart
from
visiting
crater
lake
which
in
those
days
was
one
of
the
wildest
spots
imaginable
far
out
of
the
beat
of
any
but
the
most
adventurous
tourist
and
seeing
the
rogue
river
indians
in
their
native
element
i
spent
several
weeks
in
the
big
cities
and
when
in
san
francisco
obtained
the
services
of
a
guide
and
did
a
nightly
tour
of
china
town
and
several
of
the
lesser
known
subterranean
haunts
of
that
city
it
was
in
san
francisco
that
i
had
my
first
experience
with
an
american
ghost
i
had
been
out
tramping
all
day
along
the
southern
side
of
the
bay
and
it
was
close
on
midnight
before
i
got
back
to
the
city
feeling
thoroughly
done
up
and
very
footsore
the
last
chime
of
twelve
o
clock
sounded
as
i
swung
wearily
round
street
into
a
narrow
thoroughfare
leading
to
the
obscure
quarter
of
the
town
in
which
my
finances
forced
me
to
live
as
i
came
within
sight
of
the
end
house
of
a
block
of
low
buildings
i
received
something
of
a
shock
i
had
passed
by
it
that
morning
and
had
noticed
that
it
was
to
let
i
was
quite
sure
of
this
because
there
was
something
about
the
house
that
had
especially
attracted
my
attention
i
was
struck
with
its
utter
loneliness
its
air
of
past
oddly
at
variance
with
the
modern
and
mediocre
buildings
around
peeping
in
at
the
windows
i
had
taken
stock
of
its
big
apartments
devoid
of
furniture
and
bestrewn
with
dust
and
cobwebs
now
to
my
astonishment
i
perceived
a
bright
kind
of
phosphorescent
from
one
of
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
i
approached
nearer
and
as
i
leaned
against
the
verandah
and
peered
in
it
suddenly
seemed
to
me
that
the
room
was
no
longer
empty
but
richly
carpetted
and
full
of
ponderous
furniture
i
also
seemed
to
see
in
the
centre
of
the
room
a
long
table
covered
with
a
snowy
cloth
on
which
were
arranged
in
rich
profusion
many
handsome
silver
dishes
containing
a
selection
of
the
choicest
food
i
was
dumbfounded
twelve
hours
ago
there
was
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
about
the
house
nor
a
particle
of
furniture
in
it
and
now
it
looked
to
me
as
if
it
never
never
had
been
empty
whilst
i
was
thus
meditating
my
face
glued
to
the
window
i
thought
that
a
sudden
blaze
illuminated
the
room
and
by
degrees
i
became
conscious
of
the
glare
of
countless
candles
some
of
the
candelabra
branching
from
the
walls
and
chased
on
the
table
i
then
saw
the
door
at
the
far
end
of
the
apartment
open
and
a
young
and
charming
girl
dressed
√†
la
mode
de
marie
antoinette
her
gown
and
her
hair
poudr√©
hurriedly
enter
she
gave
a
quick
glance
at
the
table
and
then
advancing
to
the
fireplace
where
for
the
first
time
i
perceived
the
cheery
glow
of
a
huge
log
of
wood
gazed
at
herself
in
a
large
mirror
the
reflection
evidently
pleased
her
for
she
turned
round
all
smiles
and
then
her
eyes
fell
on
the
window
and
on
me
in
an
instance
her
countenance
changed
putting
a
finger
to
her
lips
with
a
great
air
of
mystery
she
beckoned
to
me
to
come
in
i
started
back
in
confusion
again
she
beckoned
and
with
such
pretty
pleading
in
her
eyes
that
despite
my
clothes
i
yielded
i
walked
to
the
front
door
she
opened
it
and
in
hushed
tones
in
which
i
detected
a
slight
french
accent
she
bade
me
welcome
we
are
having
a
dance
she
said
but
none
of
the
guests
have
as
yet
arrived
and
i
want
you
to
come
into
the
while
i
rehearse
some
of
the
dance
she
led
the
way
across
a
big
deserted
and
strangely
silent
hall
up
a
flight
of
stairs
along
a
dimly
lighted
corridor
peopled
with
nothing
but
odd
shadows
to
which
i
could
see
no
material
counterparts
and
into
a
room
obviously
prepared
for
a
ball
there
is
no
one
about
but
you
and
i
she
said
laughingly
only
we
two
but
someone
else
will
arrive
soon
it
s
not
twelve
is
it
no
i
said
twenty
ten
more
minutes
she
sighed
deeply
and
her
expression
which
up
to
now
had
been
one
of
gay
mischief
changed
to
one
of
immeasurable
sadness
then
she
nodded
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
and
casting
the
most
bewitching
look
at
me
from
out
her
long
thickly
lashed
eyes
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
began
to
play
a
strauss
waltz
fascinated
though
i
was
by
her
extreme
archness
and
beauty
i
could
not
stifle
the
thousand
and
one
uncomfortable
thoughts
that
speedily
crowded
into
my
mind
who
was
this
strangely
friendly
and
peculiarly
solitary
girl
surely
someone
must
have
helped
her
prepare
the
house
and
supper
where
were
they
besides
she
couldn
t
possibly
live
in
that
house
alone
and
yet
apart
from
the
seemed
to
reverberate
through
every
stick
and
stone
of
the
was
no
other
sound
i
might
have
been
alone
with
her
on
some
desert
island
in
the
far
pacific
a
feeling
of
intense
but
wholly
unaccountable
fear
gradually
crept
over
me
it
is
close
on
the
half
hour
she
suddenly
whispered
listen
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
i
heard
a
door
from
somewhere
in
the
lower
part
of
the
house
open
and
shut
then
came
the
sound
of
muffled
footsteps
stealthily
feeling
their
way
upstairs
up
and
up
they
came
till
they
arrived
outside
the
door
of
the
room
we
were
in
there
they
stopped
and
i
instinctively
felt
that
their
owner
was
listening
presently
the
girl
recommenced
playing
and
i
saw
the
began
to
turn
slowly
very
slowly
the
door
then
opened
and
on
the
floor
of
the
room
there
appeared
a
black
indefinite
and
grotesque
the
girl
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
it
and
i
caught
an
expression
in
her
eyes
that
appalled
me
turning
to
the
piano
again
she
played
frantically
and
the
faster
her
fingers
flew
the
nearer
crept
that
shadow
suddenly
it
seemed
to
shoot
right
forward
there
was
a
wild
scream
of
terror
a
terrific
crash
and
all
was
in
absolute
darkness
i
groped
my
way
frantically
towards
the
door
could
not
define
into
violent
collision
with
me
i
staggered
back
half
stunned
and
when
my
brain
cleared
i
found
myself
standing
in
the
street
weak
with
exhaustion
i
visited
the
house
the
next
day
when
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
and
there
were
plenty
of
people
about
it
was
as
i
had
first
seen
it
untenanted
and
unfurnished
i
must
then
have
dreamed
the
whole
thing
and
what
more
likely
i
was
excessively
tired
at
the
time
so
tired
that
i
felt
i
could
hardly
crawl
without
a
doubt
i
had
dropped
off
to
sleep
resting
against
the
verandah
just
out
of
curiosity
however
i
determined
to
find
out
if
the
interior
of
the
house
in
any
way
resembled
the
interior
i
had
seen
in
my
dream
and
with
that
object
in
view
i
applied
to
the
owner
for
permission
to
look
over
it
frankly
telling
him
why
i
was
doing
so
as
he
appeared
to
be
interested
i
described
my
dream
to
him
in
detail
and
he
afterwards
told
me
the
following
story
about
fifty
years
ago
a
very
rich
french
family
occupied
the
house
and
at
the
coming
of
age
of
their
daughter
they
gave
a
ball
among
the
guests
was
an
italian
who
being
a
rejected
suitor
of
the
daughter
s
had
not
been
invited
he
appeared
in
some
grotesque
and
alarming
costume
and
when
the
dance
was
at
its
height
suddenly
overturned
a
large
oil
lamp
in
a
moment
the
whole
floor
was
ablaze
and
before
anyone
could
stop
him
he
had
seized
the
daughter
of
the
house
and
hurled
her
into
the
midst
of
the
flaming
mass
both
he
and
the
girl
were
burned
to
death
and
the
house
although
it
was
thoroughly
restored
has
never
let
having
concluded
his
story
said
he
would
like
to
go
with
me
to
the
house
and
accordingly
we
set
out
together
though
my
experience
had
been
only
a
dream
the
coincidence
connected
with
it
which
only
needed
my
identification
of
the
scene
to
be
complete
was
startling
enough
and
i
grew
more
and
more
excited
as
we
neared
our
destination
when
we
arrived
insisted
upon
my
going
first
and
once
inside
recognising
every
feature
in
the
house
i
led
him
first
to
the
room
in
which
i
had
seen
the
laid
and
then
upstairs
to
the
where
to
my
unspeakable
surprise
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
i
found
my
hat
what
a
strangely
fascinating
city
was
old
san
is
to
say
san
francisco
before
the
last
great
fire
and
earthquake
consisting
of
street
upon
street
terrace
upon
terrace
of
quaintly
irregular
buildings
to
me
its
no
other
atmosphere
ever
has
impregnated
with
the
superphysical
i
stayed
for
a
few
days
in
a
vast
hotel
in
street
in
which
i
was
the
only
visitor
i
shrewdly
suspect
it
was
haunted
although
i
can
not
truthfully
say
that
i
ever
saw
a
ghost
there
and
when
i
retired
to
bed
up
flight
after
flight
of
stairs
and
past
passages
teeming
with
with
nothing
nothing
material
at
least
behind
only
sounds
i
heard
were
the
hollow
echoes
of
my
own
footsteps
as
i
went
on
ascending
higher
higher
and
higher
hearing
however
that
i
was
interested
in
ghosts
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
introduced
me
one
day
to
a
sweeney
who
kept
a
drug
store
in
market
street
the
only
experience
i
ever
had
with
the
supernatural
sweeney
began
in
answer
to
my
interrogations
took
place
in
this
very
room
exactly
twelve
years
ago
i
engaged
the
services
of
a
young
man
called
edward
marsdon
he
was
very
amiable
and
capable
but
and
hypernormally
sensitive
he
had
been
with
me
about
six
months
when
he
came
into
the
parlour
one
evening
with
a
face
like
a
corpse
i
ve
poisoned
someone
he
gasped
poisoned
someone
i
ejaculated
good
god
what
do
you
mean
what
i
say
he
replied
a
young
fellow
came
into
the
store
about
an
hour
ago
and
handed
me
a
prescription
it
was
signed
by
knelligan
of
street
i
made
it
up
as
i
thought
all
right
and
gave
it
him
a
few
minutes
ago
i
found
i
had
put
in
salts
of
lemon
instead
of
are
you
sure
i
asked
certain
he
said
as
the
bottle
of
salts
of
lemon
is
on
the
table
in
the
laboratory
with
the
stopper
out
i
must
have
used
it
in
mistake
the
young
man
will
die
if
indeed
he
is
not
dead
already
and
i
am
ruined
for
we
both
are
i
said
tersely
ring
up
knelligan
at
once
and
ask
him
for
the
young
man
s
address
when
you
get
it
drive
round
at
once
and
see
if
you
are
in
it
was
of
no
use
scolding
him
for
was
upset
enough
already
and
a
blowing
up
just
then
might
i
thought
result
in
another
tragedy
the
only
thing
to
be
done
was
to
hope
for
the
best
he
rang
up
knelligan
got
the
address
drove
round
to
it
and
discovered
that
the
young
man
had
just
left
the
landlady
had
no
idea
where
he
had
gone
to
marsdon
this
was
the
last
straw
he
came
back
in
a
state
of
utter
collapse
trembling
all
over
as
if
he
had
ague
and
after
telling
me
what
happened
he
went
upstairs
and
slammed
his
door
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
my
wife
the
servant
and
i
all
heard
marsdon
so
we
thought
come
downstairs
and
go
out
the
servant
then
went
up
to
his
room
to
make
the
bed
and
hearing
her
scream
out
i
ran
upstairs
to
find
her
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
wringing
her
hands
whilst
marsdon
was
sitting
in
a
he
had
been
dead
some
minutes
that
o
donnell
was
the
beginning
of
the
strange
occurrences
here
if
it
was
not
marsdon
whom
we
all
heard
go
out
who
could
it
have
been
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
but
we
three
and
the
body
in
the
chair
upstairs
so
that
it
must
have
been
marsdon
s
ghost
well
from
that
day
on
we
had
no
peace
footsteps
which
we
all
recognised
as
marsdon
s
for
he
had
a
most
peculiar
lumping
kind
of
walk
trod
up
and
down
the
stairs
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
and
frequently
when
i
was
in
the
laboratory
mixing
medicines
i
was
strongly
conscious
of
some
presence
standing
close
beside
me
and
watching
everything
i
did
one
day
my
wife
saw
him
she
was
going
out
and
wanting
some
money
she
called
to
me
as
i
did
not
answer
she
went
in
search
of
me
and
finding
me
as
she
thought
standing
on
the
hearthrug
of
the
parlour
with
my
back
to
her
she
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
the
next
moment
she
discovered
her
mistake
the
person
whom
she
had
mistaken
for
me
turned
round
and
she
found
herself
confronted
with
the
white
scared
countenance
of
edward
marsdon
she
started
back
with
a
loud
shriek
and
marsdon
walked
out
of
the
room
and
apparently
right
through
the
servant
who
came
running
in
to
see
what
was
the
matter
my
wife
asked
the
maid
if
she
had
seen
anything
and
the
latter
said
no
only
a
dark
shadow
seemed
to
fall
right
across
me
and
just
for
a
second
or
so
i
felt
miserably
a
week
or
so
afterwards
he
was
again
seen
this
time
by
my
wife
and
the
maid
they
met
him
on
the
stairs
he
appeared
to
be
under
the
influence
of
some
very
painful
emotion
and
he
passed
them
at
a
great
rate
and
so
near
that
they
felt
his
quite
against
them
he
disappeared
in
the
laboratory
and
on
their
entering
it
immediately
afterwards
there
was
no
one
there
something
of
this
auditory
or
visual
or
happened
pretty
well
daily
until
one
morning
a
young
man
came
to
the
store
to
see
me
i
am
the
young
man
he
said
to
whom
your
assistant
gave
that
unfortunate
mixture
i
have
just
returned
to
san
francisco
and
have
heard
all
about
it
the
medicine
was
perfectly
all
right
i
drank
it
directly
i
left
here
and
it
did
me
the
world
of
good
there
was
not
even
the
suspicion
of
poison
in
it
marsdon
was
labouring
under
some
extraordinary
delusion
if
only
he
had
told
my
landlady
about
it
when
he
called
and
found
i
had
gone
she
could
have
given
him
the
glass
i
had
drank
out
of
which
doubtless
contained
some
dregs
of
the
any
rate
a
sufficient
quantity
for
analysis
i
am
told
there
are
rumours
afloat
that
his
apparition
has
been
seen
several
times
since
he
died
not
that
i
believe
in
such
things
as
whether
you
believe
in
them
or
not
i
said
quietly
it
is
a
fact
edward
marsdon
has
both
been
seen
and
then
i
hope
he
said
my
visit
here
will
put
matters
all
right
and
that
his
poor
wandering
spirit
learning
that
i
am
alive
and
well
will
find
rest
and
trouble
you
no
he
then
bid
me
and
walked
towards
the
door
my
god
he
suddenly
cried
coming
to
an
abrupt
halt
there
he
is
i
looked
and
as
sure
as
i
am
sitting
here
o
donnell
there
was
edward
marsdon
just
as
i
had
known
him
in
life
standing
on
the
pavement
with
his
face
glued
to
the
window
peering
in
at
us
the
expression
in
his
eyes
was
one
of
infinite
joy
and
astonishment
i
took
a
step
or
two
towards
him
with
the
intention
of
speaking
when
he
immediately
vanished
and
from
that
day
to
this
the
hauntings
have
entirely
chapter
v
a
haunted
office
in
denver
after
leaving
san
francisco
i
visited
sacramento
where
i
bought
a
pair
of
braces
suspenders
as
they
call
them
there
that
lasted
me
for
years
they
were
the
very
best
s
worth
i
ever
had
and
i
still
have
the
remains
of
them
stowed
away
in
a
big
trunk
amongst
other
mementos
of
the
long
past
i
can
t
imagine
any
city
in
america
hotter
than
sacramento
in
the
summer
or
more
unpleasantly
cold
in
the
winter
apart
from
which
there
was
nothing
about
the
place
that
caused
it
to
be
very
deeply
impressed
on
my
memory
saving
that
i
met
a
man
in
one
of
the
streets
one
day
who
was
so
exactly
like
an
old
clifton
college
master
called
tait
that
i
believed
it
was
he
and
accosted
him
accordingly
the
man
gasped
at
me
in
amazement
why
jupp
he
said
how
on
earth
have
you
managed
it
it
s
only
ten
minutes
since
i
left
you
eating
your
dinner
in
the
eagle
hotel
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
have
you
wings
the
moment
he
spoke
i
knew
he
was
not
tait
but
it
took
me
some
time
to
convince
him
i
was
not
jupp
and
when
he
introduced
me
to
the
latter
half
an
hour
or
so
later
i
was
not
surprised
for
i
do
not
think
there
could
have
been
a
more
striking
likeness
to
myself
even
in
my
own
portrait
the
coincidence
was
all
the
more
remarkable
since
there
was
at
clifton
college
contemporary
with
tait
a
master
named
jupp
of
whose
cane
i
had
the
most
striking
recollection
in
appearance
however
the
clifton
jupp
was
not
in
the
least
bit
like
me
this
was
the
only
adventure
of
note
if
one
may
so
designate
it
i
had
during
this
visit
to
sacramento
i
went
on
from
there
to
denver
where
i
met
one
or
two
relatives
of
friends
of
mine
in
england
and
did
a
little
work
as
a
free
lance
journalist
it
was
summer
when
i
had
last
stayed
in
denver
and
then
the
intense
heat
combined
with
an
injudicious
consumption
of
fruit
and
iced
water
had
brought
on
a
mild
attack
of
cholera
which
left
me
with
a
none
too
favourable
impression
of
the
place
but
now
all
was
changed
the
weather
was
much
cooler
i
was
growing
acclimatised
and
i
did
not
feel
altogether
among
strangers
consequently
my
apathy
vanished
and
despite
the
fact
that
my
employment
was
anything
but
lucrative
i
enjoyed
this
second
stay
in
denver
immensely
the
town
had
not
been
built
long
indeed
ten
years
previously
it
had
only
one
anything
like
orthodox
street
so
that
it
was
the
last
place
in
the
world
where
one
would
expect
to
come
across
a
haunted
house
yet
i
heard
of
three
haunted
houses
at
least
whilst
i
was
there
the
one
i
think
most
likely
to
interest
my
readers
i
heard
of
in
this
way
i
had
been
to
the
zoological
gardens
and
was
returning
by
tram
when
a
journalist
called
rouillac
with
whom
i
had
a
very
slight
acquaintance
came
running
up
to
me
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
o
donnell
he
cried
i
have
unearthed
something
that
will
interest
case
of
a
haunting
in
an
office
in
race
he
then
proceeded
to
give
me
an
account
of
it
the
office
was
rented
by
a
bell
a
typist
who
employed
two
girls
stella
dean
and
hester
holt
one
day
hester
holt
failed
to
put
in
an
appearance
if
she
is
ill
bell
said
to
stella
dean
she
ought
to
have
let
me
know
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
her
yesterday
was
there
not
that
i
am
aware
of
stella
dean
replied
when
she
parted
from
me
just
across
the
way
she
went
off
in
the
best
of
spirits
i
expect
she
ll
turn
up
all
right
the
morrow
came
and
hester
holt
not
arriving
stella
dean
was
despatched
in
the
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
her
she
returned
looking
very
white
and
scared
why
stella
bell
exclaimed
what
on
earth
s
the
matter
hester
s
gone
away
without
telling
anyone
where
she
was
going
stella
dean
answered
you
don
t
say
so
bell
cried
what
can
have
happened
she
never
went
to
her
lodgings
after
leaving
here
at
least
that
s
what
the
landlady
says
stella
dean
replied
and
she
hasn
t
written
i
think
you
d
better
call
there
yourself
i
don
t
like
the
and
stella
burst
out
crying
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
mystery
bell
interviewed
the
landlady
who
stuck
to
her
statement
that
she
had
neither
seen
hester
holt
nor
heard
of
her
since
she
had
left
the
house
two
days
ago
presumably
to
attend
business
there
had
been
no
words
between
them
she
said
and
hester
had
seemed
as
usual
perfectly
happy
she
was
a
singularly
reserved
girl
and
never
mentioned
her
family
excepting
when
she
went
away
for
her
annual
holiday
she
then
requested
that
all
her
letters
should
be
forwarded
to
the
address
of
her
married
sister
the
landlady
britton
gave
this
address
to
bell
and
the
latter
writing
off
at
once
received
an
answer
by
return
of
post
to
say
that
hester
was
not
there
and
no
tidings
of
her
had
been
received
for
over
a
month
the
married
sister
however
made
an
important
statement
she
said
that
one
person
was
sure
to
know
of
hester
s
whereabouts
and
that
was
pete
simpkins
the
young
man
with
whom
she
kept
company
and
was
hoping
eventually
to
marry
bell
now
keenly
interested
hastened
off
and
interviewed
simpkins
to
quote
her
own
words
he
seemed
a
bright
intelligent
young
man
and
exhibited
unfeigned
astonishment
and
perturbation
on
learning
of
the
disappearance
of
his
sweetheart
when
did
you
last
see
her
bell
enquired
the
day
she
left
you
he
responded
i
had
been
out
in
the
country
all
day
superintending
the
building
of
a
large
farm
some
ten
miles
to
the
east
of
this
city
and
i
was
cycling
home
along
a
very
unfrequented
route
when
i
met
a
buggy
two
girls
were
in
it
and
to
my
amazement
they
were
hester
and
stella
what
bell
cried
stella
dean
are
you
sure
absolutely
simpkins
replied
i
can
swear
to
it
it
astonished
me
because
i
knew
they
had
been
on
very
bad
terms
i
was
engaged
to
stella
before
i
met
hester
but
i
could
not
stand
her
temper
one
day
she
was
so
enraged
with
my
dog
because
it
snarled
at
her
that
she
seized
my
and
beat
it
on
the
head
till
it
was
dead
i
found
her
standing
over
it
white
with
fury
and
feeling
that
after
what
i
had
witnessed
i
could
never
like
her
again
i
broke
off
our
engagement
there
and
then
after
that
i
met
hester
holt
at
the
same
house
where
i
had
first
seen
stella
and
we
at
once
became
friends
stella
dean
did
not
like
it
but
she
took
on
more
than
was
necessary
and
hester
told
me
there
had
been
several
very
painful
scenes
between
them
indeed
i
understood
that
out
of
business
hours
they
were
not
on
speaking
terms
hence
you
can
judge
of
my
astonishment
when
i
saw
them
driving
in
the
buggy
side
by
it
s
all
very
mysterious
bell
observed
if
she
does
not
turn
up
soon
i
shall
have
to
inform
the
the
following
day
bell
asked
stella
if
she
had
gone
for
a
drive
with
hester
holt
the
evening
of
the
latter
s
disappearance
and
stella
dean
promptly
replied
no
the
last
time
i
saw
hester
was
when
she
left
here
that
afternoon
she
said
to
me
as
usual
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
i
have
never
set
eyes
on
her
she
admitted
she
had
once
been
engaged
to
pete
simpkins
but
emphatically
denied
that
hester
s
keeping
company
with
him
had
led
to
any
rupture
between
them
hester
and
i
were
always
on
the
very
best
of
terms
she
said
and
it
would
be
downright
mean
of
anyone
to
allege
otherwise
besides
i
can
produce
proofs
to
the
the
next
day
as
hester
was
still
missing
bell
told
the
police
the
affair
was
at
once
inquired
into
and
pete
simpkins
story
about
the
buggy
was
corroborated
someone
else
had
seen
the
two
girls
driving
towards
the
outskirts
of
the
town
that
same
evening
whilst
a
car
proprietor
also
came
forward
and
declared
that
he
recollected
miss
holt
hiring
a
buggy
from
him
but
that
she
had
driven
off
in
it
alone
when
the
buggy
was
brought
back
he
being
out
his
wife
had
taken
the
money
for
it
but
as
it
was
then
dusk
she
could
not
possibly
swear
to
the
identity
of
the
lady
who
had
paid
her
especially
as
the
latter
had
been
so
muffled
up
presumably
on
account
of
the
coldness
of
the
night
that
practically
nothing
of
her
face
was
visible
she
could
only
say
miss
dean
resembled
her
both
in
build
and
height
illustration
who
is
that
tall
girl
stella
that
i
ve
seen
following
you
into
the
building
stella
dean
was
now
asked
if
she
could
produce
an
alibi
and
accordingly
her
mother
a
very
decrepit
old
lady
declared
that
stella
had
come
straight
home
from
the
office
and
had
remained
indoors
all
that
evening
to
add
to
the
complexity
of
the
affair
someone
else
testified
to
having
seen
hester
holt
enter
britton
s
house
with
a
latch
key
rather
late
on
the
night
in
question
and
this
of
course
made
some
people
suspect
britton
but
the
police
could
prove
nothing
and
the
matter
was
eventually
dropped
all
this
happened
about
three
months
before
i
arrived
in
denver
a
week
after
the
disappearance
of
hester
holt
bell
had
a
new
assistant
called
vera
cummings
a
very
material
practical
young
lady
the
daughter
of
a
farmer
somewhere
near
omaha
the
day
after
her
arrival
miss
cummings
was
busy
typewriting
in
the
office
with
bell
and
stella
dean
when
she
suddenly
exclaimed
how
is
it
that
i
get
convulsed
with
shivers
whenever
i
sit
next
to
you
miss
dean
i
don
t
when
i
m
sitting
next
to
bell
eugh
i
feel
as
if
the
icy
east
wind
were
blowing
right
through
what
nonsense
stella
dean
replied
you
imagine
no
i
don
t
miss
cummings
retorted
i
m
going
to
sit
somewhere
else
and
she
moved
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
bell
made
no
comment
an
hour
or
so
afterwards
vera
cummings
abruptly
observed
my
stella
dean
what
long
legs
you
have
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
was
the
surprised
and
rather
indignant
retort
why
there
s
no
one
else
on
your
side
of
the
table
is
there
vera
cummings
responded
and
someone
s
feet
keep
kicking
you
re
dreaming
stella
dean
said
and
bell
noticed
she
turned
very
pale
two
days
now
passed
uneventfully
but
on
the
third
day
after
the
above
conversation
bell
and
the
two
girls
were
sitting
was
close
on
the
interval
for
tea
and
work
was
just
then
very
vera
cummings
remarked
who
is
that
tall
girl
stella
that
i
ve
seen
following
you
into
the
building
on
several
occasions
i
ve
watched
her
keeping
close
behind
you
till
you
get
to
the
elevator
and
then
she
disappears
where
she
goes
i
can
t
a
tall
girl
following
me
to
the
elevator
stella
dean
repeated
her
cheeks
ashy
what
do
you
mean
i
ve
seen
no
one
you
ve
dreamt
what
was
she
like
bell
interrupted
vera
cummings
gave
a
minute
description
of
her
are
you
sure
stella
we
don
t
know
anyone
like
her
bell
said
quietly
that
description
seems
to
tally
exactly
with
someone
we
once
knew
someone
who
used
to
frequent
this
place
can
she
have
returned
do
you
think
i
don
t
know
who
you
mean
stella
dean
said
crossly
i
tell
you
i
ve
seen
no
the
next
morning
they
all
three
arrived
simultaneously
and
went
up
together
in
the
elevator
on
nearing
the
office
the
sound
of
a
typewriter
was
heard
they
looked
at
one
another
in
astonishment
it
must
be
one
of
the
other
clerks
in
the
building
vera
cummings
said
she
s
mistaken
our
room
for
hers
she
s
an
early
bird
anyway
for
i
reckon
there
s
no
one
else
arrived
but
the
door
s
locked
bell
whispered
see
here
s
the
key
and
she
took
it
out
of
her
pocket
as
she
spoke
well
there
s
no
mistaking
the
sound
is
there
vera
cummings
laughed
click
click
s
a
typewriter
sure
enough
someone
must
have
got
in
through
the
window
my
stella
how
white
you
are
bell
glanced
sharply
at
stella
was
not
an
atom
of
colour
in
her
cheeks
and
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
were
dilating
with
terror
bell
then
put
the
key
in
the
lock
and
opened
the
door
the
typewriter
was
working
away
furiously
but
there
was
no
one
at
it
the
room
was
absolutely
empty
it
stopped
the
moment
bell
crossed
the
threshold
that
afternoon
stella
dean
complained
of
a
headache
and
went
home
early
she
was
in
bed
for
several
weeks
and
during
her
absence
from
the
office
the
strange
phenomena
there
entirely
ceased
the
morning
she
returned
pete
simpkins
met
her
and
vera
cummings
just
outside
the
office
building
he
was
bubbling
over
with
excitement
she
s
come
back
he
cried
come
back
and
never
sent
me
a
word
i
glad
though
hoorah
come
back
stella
dean
said
drawing
herself
up
stiffly
and
regarding
him
with
an
angry
stare
who
are
you
talking
about
hester
holt
pete
simpkins
ejaculated
she
s
just
gone
into
your
place
didn
t
you
know
miss
dean
made
no
reply
she
simply
pushed
past
him
and
walked
in
vera
cummings
however
dawdled
behind
what
s
miss
holt
like
she
asked
anxiously
simpkins
described
her
why
that
s
the
girl
i
used
constantly
to
see
following
stella
she
said
where
she
disappears
to
is
a
mystery
but
it
s
only
one
of
the
many
funny
things
that
have
happened
since
i
ve
been
she
then
told
him
about
the
typewriter
and
the
feet
under
the
table
pete
simpkins
repeated
the
story
to
his
friends
rouillac
got
hold
of
it
and
hence
as
the
reader
already
knows
it
was
handed
on
to
me
rouillac
was
most
anxious
that
i
should
go
with
him
to
the
haunted
office
straightaway
but
it
so
happened
that
i
had
work
to
finish
in
a
given
time
and
it
was
therefore
arranged
that
he
should
call
for
me
one
day
the
following
week
at
the
hour
appointed
he
came
i
fear
it
s
no
use
he
said
the
office
is
closed
and
it
is
impossible
to
get
permission
to
go
there
it
s
come
about
like
this
the
day
after
stella
dean
returned
to
work
bell
was
the
two
girls
were
alone
some
time
after
they
had
started
work
it
might
have
been
eleven
o
clock
or
thereabouts
vera
cummings
got
up
to
get
a
drink
of
water
and
in
passing
chanced
to
look
at
stella
dean
the
latter
was
leaning
forward
in
her
chair
and
staring
with
an
expression
of
the
utmost
horror
in
her
eyes
at
a
despatch
case
on
the
floor
which
was
oscillating
violently
to
and
fro
vera
noticed
that
the
despatch
case
was
marked
on
one
side
with
the
letters
h
that
s
odd
she
cried
what
makes
it
do
like
can
t
be
due
to
vibration
because
there
s
nothing
going
by
outside
how
do
you
account
for
it
stella
i
don
t
know
stella
dean
gasped
making
a
vigorous
attempt
to
appear
unconcerned
perhaps
they
re
shunting
something
heavy
but
we
should
hear
them
vera
cummings
replied
i
believe
it
s
hester
holt
she
s
dead
and
for
some
mysterious
reason
her
spirit
haunts
this
nonsense
stella
dean
stammered
how
can
you
be
so
silly
there
are
no
such
things
as
after
a
while
the
case
stopped
shaking
and
the
two
girls
went
on
with
their
work
lunch
time
came
and
they
both
rose
to
get
ready
to
go
out
vera
cummings
had
put
on
her
hat
and
was
walking
to
the
door
when
she
heard
a
sharp
cry
she
turned
round
and
there
was
stella
dean
standing
in
front
of
the
looking
glass
and
gazing
at
the
reflection
of
a
pale
face
with
two
dark
menacing
eyes
glaring
fixedly
at
her
from
over
her
shoulder
vera
recognised
the
face
at
once
it
was
that
of
the
girl
she
had
so
often
seen
following
stella
the
girl
pete
simpkins
had
told
her
was
hester
holt
she
was
so
frightened
for
she
knew
for
certain
now
that
the
thing
she
was
looking
at
was
nothing
earthly
that
she
ran
out
of
the
room
and
as
she
crossed
the
threshold
the
door
slammed
behind
her
with
a
terrific
crash
ashamed
of
her
cowardice
she
tried
the
it
turned
but
though
she
pressed
her
hardest
the
door
would
not
open
she
called
to
stella
there
was
no
reply
greatly
alarmed
she
ran
to
the
elevator
and
fetched
the
man
in
charge
of
it
they
both
pushed
the
door
and
still
it
would
not
open
they
were
deliberating
what
to
do
when
they
saw
the
handle
suddenly
turn
and
the
door
gently
swing
back
on
its
hinges
they
peered
in
stella
dean
was
lying
on
the
hearthrug
in
a
dead
faint
she
died
that
same
died
yes
some
people
fancy
she
committed
suicide
but
her
mother
declares
that
her
heart
had
long
been
affected
and
that
she
died
from
syncope
anyhow
she
s
dead
and
the
office
is
closed
as
nothing
will
persuade
vera
cummings
to
work
there
till
bell
is
well
enough
to
return
i
tried
to
get
permission
to
spend
a
night
there
but
bell
dare
not
give
it
she
says
the
landlord
is
furious
with
her
for
allowing
the
report
to
get
abroad
that
the
building
is
haunted
and
threatens
her
with
a
libel
action
if
he
hears
anything
that
s
a
great
pity
i
said
for
few
cases
have
interested
me
what
do
you
make
of
it
rouillac
asked
why
i
replied
the
same
as
you
there
can
only
be
one
conclusion
stella
dean
was
madly
jealous
of
hester
holt
and
during
that
drive
in
the
buggy
she
killed
her
whether
the
murder
was
premeditated
or
done
in
a
sudden
fit
of
blind
tell
me
her
temper
at
times
was
very
course
we
can
not
say
from
your
sketch
of
her
however
i
am
inclined
to
think
she
planned
the
whole
but
what
could
she
have
done
with
the
body
rouillac
said
the
police
searched
so
they
say
i
observed
but
the
track
simpkins
was
on
when
he
passed
the
buggy
affords
countless
opportunities
for
concealing
a
body
it
is
full
of
deep
ditches
creeks
and
crevices
covered
with
a
thick
and
rank
vegetation
and
the
police
would
take
at
least
a
century
to
explore
it
besides
from
what
i
know
of
the
i
do
not
think
for
one
moment
that
stella
dean
was
haunted
without
some
poignant
was
haunted
rouillac
observed
you
said
she
was
dead
didn
t
you
i
exclaimed
yes
rouillac
replied
slowly
there
s
no
doubt
whatever
on
that
point
she
s
dead
right
enough
but
when
vera
cummings
passed
by
the
office
this
morning
she
saw
stella
dean
enter
dean
just
as
she
looked
when
alive
only
very
white
and
in
abject
terror
she
passed
right
in
through
the
doorway
and
as
usual
hester
holt
followed
chapter
vi
cases
of
hauntings
in
louis
new
york
and
chicago
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
men
i
have
ever
met
was
ephraim
vandergooch
who
at
the
time
of
my
travels
in
america
practised
dentistry
in
street
louis
dentists
are
not
as
a
rule
the
people
to
associate
themselves
with
psychical
research
and
it
is
just
as
well
for
their
patients
perhaps
that
they
are
not
for
sitting
up
all
night
in
dark
houses
looking
for
ghosts
has
an
unsteadying
effect
on
the
is
apt
to
make
one
jumpy
if
a
dentist
s
hand
were
to
jump
it
is
more
than
likely
that
his
patient
would
jump
too
vandergooch
however
was
an
exception
he
was
a
ghost
hunter
and
his
investigations
had
but
a
slight
and
temporary
effect
on
his
nervous
system
his
hand
was
as
steady
as
a
rock
his
wrists
like
steel
i
went
to
him
to
have
a
tooth
filled
and
during
the
operation
i
asked
him
if
he
knew
of
any
haunted
houses
in
the
town
he
was
a
stranger
to
me
then
and
of
course
i
expected
a
superior
smile
if
not
an
actual
sneer
for
as
i
have
said
dentists
are
as
a
rule
anything
but
psychics
to
my
surprise
however
he
took
me
quite
seriously
and
said
he
knew
of
several
haunted
places
in
louis
and
that
nothing
interested
him
more
than
really
ghost
stories
he
told
me
he
had
had
an
experience
himself
and
narrated
the
following
a
few
years
ago
he
began
i
learned
of
a
haunting
in
a
street
of
rather
older
houses
than
these
close
to
here
and
as
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
to
a
large
extent
corroborative
i
decided
to
investigate
it
it
was
christmas
time
and
the
thought
of
earthbound
spirits
pacing
up
and
down
cold
empty
houses
when
all
around
was
warmth
and
jollity
depressed
me
i
felt
that
i
must
now
that
an
opportunity
had
come
try
to
see
them
and
if
possible
do
something
for
them
i
set
out
on
christmas
eve
and
i
admit
that
when
i
left
the
cheerfully
lighted
thoroughfare
and
plunged
into
the
dark
silent
emptiness
of
the
house
my
heart
almost
failed
me
apart
from
ghosts
there
were
so
many
possibilities
and
what
more
likely
than
that
some
tramp
or
criminal
had
forced
an
entrance
and
was
hiding
somewhere
on
the
premises
for
a
few
seconds
i
stood
and
listened
and
then
feeling
a
trifle
more
assured
i
closed
the
door
gently
and
advanced
cautiously
along
the
wide
hall
at
each
step
i
took
i
became
more
and
more
sensitive
to
an
atmosphere
of
intense
sadness
and
atmosphere
of
intense
loneliness
loneliness
that
is
without
is
perpetual
and
absolute
it
could
be
felt
in
all
parts
of
the
house
but
more
particularly
perhaps
in
the
kitchen
which
was
built
out
at
the
back
on
the
ground
floor
i
had
never
been
in
such
a
dreary
and
inhospitable
kitchen
the
night
was
bitterly
cold
and
the
bare
stones
sent
chilly
currents
up
my
legs
and
back
into
my
very
brain
to
remain
in
such
a
hole
till
morning
was
assuredly
courting
pneumonia
or
rheumatic
fever
i
looked
at
the
range
it
was
covered
with
rust
and
verdigris
if
only
it
could
be
lighted
then
i
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
for
lying
in
one
corner
was
a
pile
of
shelves
faggots
intermingled
with
an
assortment
of
other
rubbish
in
my
early
days
i
had
lived
on
a
ranch
out
west
and
the
experience
i
had
had
there
now
came
in
useful
in
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
loud
crackling
and
the
kitchen
filled
with
a
ruddy
glow
a
couple
of
served
me
for
a
seat
and
i
was
soon
ensconced
in
a
tolerably
snug
position
from
which
however
i
was
prepared
to
spring
at
a
moment
s
notice
the
hours
sped
by
and
the
silence
deepened
at
last
just
about
two
o
clock
when
i
was
beginning
to
think
nothing
would
happen
i
heard
a
door
slam
somewhere
upstairs
this
was
followed
by
a
series
of
creaks
and
i
heard
someone
cautiously
descending
the
stairs
a
great
fear
now
seized
me
and
had
i
been
able
i
should
doubtless
have
beaten
a
hasty
retreat
instead
i
was
possessed
with
a
kind
of
paralysis
which
rendered
me
quite
helpless
and
prevented
me
from
either
moving
a
limb
or
uttering
a
sound
the
creaks
came
down
down
until
quite
suddenly
they
stopped
and
i
heard
a
cough
it
was
cough
cough
the
cough
of
a
delicate
neurotic
woman
at
first
it
simply
startled
sounded
so
distinct
so
reverberating
so
real
then
it
irritated
me
and
then
it
infuriated
drove
me
mad
god
take
the
woman
i
raved
will
she
never
cough
cough
cough
a
nervous
hacking
cough
a
worrying
grating
cough
an
intensely
silly
cough
i
could
see
the
owner
of
hidden
from
me
by
impenetrable
darkness
and
yet
quite
slight
pale
excessively
plain
little
woman
with
watery
eyes
and
a
quivering
mouth
heavens
how
the
mouth
maddened
me
on
she
cough
cough
she
was
still
coughing
when
i
suddenly
became
aware
of
a
presence
close
beside
me
and
i
saw
in
the
glow
from
the
dying
embers
the
figure
of
a
man
seated
at
a
table
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
he
appeared
to
be
trying
to
write
but
to
be
unable
to
collect
his
thoughts
every
now
and
then
he
paused
dashed
his
pen
down
and
clenched
his
fists
furiously
at
first
i
could
not
understand
his
behaviour
and
then
it
all
of
a
sudden
occurred
to
coughing
of
course
that
perpetual
noise
that
everlasting
distracted
demented
him
i
watched
him
with
feelings
of
infinite
sympathy
at
last
unable
to
stand
it
any
longer
he
sprang
from
his
seat
and
dashed
upstairs
i
heard
him
race
up
two
steps
at
a
time
no
madman
would
have
raced
faster
or
more
nimbly
then
came
a
strange
variety
of
gratuitous
course
in
altercation
more
coughing
oaths
bumping
a
scream
a
thud
a
little
feeble
cough
silence
and
then
rapidly
descending
man
s
footsteps
i
did
not
wait
for
them
the
spell
that
had
hitherto
held
me
now
abruptly
left
me
and
i
fled
out
of
the
the
next
made
my
report
to
the
owner
of
the
house
and
told
her
exactly
what
had
happened
good
heavens
she
exclaimed
and
he
s
married
maisie
swear
that
you
will
never
tell
a
soul
no
one
not
even
your
most
intimate
friend
and
i
will
give
you
an
explanation
of
what
you
all
this
happened
years
ago
vandergooch
remarked
so
it
s
all
right
my
telling
you
i
promised
and
she
at
once
began
ten
years
ago
the
occupants
of
the
house
you
ve
been
in
were
a
dramatist
and
his
wife
whom
i
will
call
and
charles
turner
turner
was
exactly
like
the
woman
you
small
and
very
plain
whilst
her
husband
would
tally
with
the
man
you
saw
in
the
tall
muscular
handsome
man
he
obviously
married
her
for
her
money
poor
soul
for
there
was
nothing
in
her
to
attract
him
and
everyone
could
see
how
she
irritated
him
especially
when
she
fact
he
often
said
to
me
you
don
t
know
wehlen
how
eva
annoys
me
whenever
i
am
in
the
midst
of
my
work
trying
to
concentrate
my
thoughts
she
starts
her
infernal
can
hear
her
all
over
the
hack
she
can
t
help
it
poor
thing
i
replied
you
ought
to
feel
sorry
for
feel
sorry
for
her
he
said
you
d
feel
sorry
for
her
if
you
were
tormented
as
i
am
i
believe
she
does
it
on
well
one
be
precise
it
was
christmas
turner
was
found
at
the
foot
of
the
hall
staircase
with
her
neck
broken
there
was
no
direct
evidence
as
to
how
she
came
there
but
as
one
of
the
was
found
loose
it
was
presumed
that
she
fell
over
it
and
accordingly
a
verdict
of
accidental
death
was
returned
charles
turner
left
the
house
directly
afterwards
and
a
few
months
ago
married
my
niece
maisie
as
far
as
i
know
what
you
have
seen
has
never
been
seen
by
anyone
else
but
coughing
in
the
house
has
been
heard
and
it
is
quite
plain
to
me
now
that
charles
turner
murdered
his
first
wife
i
only
pray
to
heaven
he
won
t
serve
maisie
the
but
he
did
vandergooch
added
for
she
too
was
found
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
with
her
neck
broken
in
all
probability
she
had
possessed
some
idiosyncrasy
that
worried
and
annoyed
him
or
possibly
having
once
taken
to
murder
he
felt
he
must
go
on
with
habit
of
homicide
being
no
doubt
just
as
fascinating
as
the
habit
of
drugs
or
of
drink
nothing
however
was
proven
and
for
all
i
know
to
the
contrary
he
may
still
be
alive
still
be
killing
people
to
appease
his
and
outraged
this
experience
of
vandergooch
made
me
think
and
eventually
led
to
my
devoting
no
small
amount
of
attention
to
psychology
and
criminology
from
what
a
variety
of
influences
it
seemed
to
me
any
one
act
might
be
induced
and
to
what
innumerable
and
varied
causes
any
one
crime
for
instance
murder
might
be
traced
a
minute
bone
pressing
on
a
certain
section
of
the
brain
a
stomach
continually
overladen
with
beefsteak
and
other
animal
food
nerves
the
sight
of
some
locality
such
as
a
wood
an
object
such
as
a
knife
all
may
lead
to
the
same
desire
to
kill
whilst
at
the
same
time
the
superphysical
through
the
agency
of
some
evil
spirit
continually
whispering
to
its
selected
victim
the
arrestive
the
compelling
thought
almost
enforces
any
and
every
sort
of
crime
seeing
then
that
in
every
act
of
cruelty
or
violence
it
is
more
than
likely
that
either
one
or
other
of
these
factors
has
been
at
work
is
it
fair
that
we
should
so
readily
condemn
and
therewith
rest
content
true
it
may
be
and
i
believe
it
is
expedient
to
punish
the
criminal
but
surely
it
is
even
more
urgent
that
we
should
make
ourselves
thoroughly
acquainted
with
his
case
so
that
we
may
if
possible
discover
the
factor
that
conduces
to
his
crime
and
then
either
destroy
or
counteract
it
from
louis
i
went
to
new
york
where
i
lodged
in
a
fifty
cent
hotel
in
west
quay
it
was
not
a
particularly
elevating
neighbourhood
but
it
was
one
that
boasted
of
several
haunted
houses
i
was
taken
to
see
one
of
small
store
that
supplied
seamen
s
a
fellow
lodger
who
if
i
remember
rightly
bore
the
name
of
boxer
the
proprietor
of
the
store
was
a
swede
his
name
i
can
not
quite
recall
it
was
i
believe
jansen
or
something
like
jansen
he
was
at
first
extremely
reticent
but
on
my
assuring
him
that
i
was
not
in
touch
with
any
of
the
new
york
journals
and
would
not
connive
at
his
story
getting
into
print
he
agreed
to
tell
me
what
had
happened
calling
his
wife
a
plain
woman
dressed
in
a
neat
and
spotlessly
clean
print
gown
he
led
the
way
upstairs
to
the
top
landing
there
he
stopped
opposite
a
closed
door
in
front
of
which
stood
a
large
oak
chest
that
s
the
room
he
said
we
ve
barricaded
it
like
that
to
prevent
the
children
going
in
when
we
first
came
here
my
wife
and
i
and
our
youngest
child
bertha
slept
there
but
we
none
of
us
liked
the
room
and
we
soon
began
to
have
very
disturbed
nights
i
had
ghastly
nightmares
and
so
had
my
wife
and
bertha
too
jansen
chimed
in
she
used
to
dread
being
left
alone
in
the
room
even
for
five
minutes
and
used
to
cry
till
one
or
other
of
us
went
to
that
s
right
enough
jansen
interrupted
and
bertha
s
never
behaved
like
that
since
we
moved
her
into
another
well
we
experienced
nothing
more
disturbing
than
bad
dreams
for
the
first
fortnight
or
so
and
nothing
happened
until
we
were
both
aroused
one
night
by
hearing
bertha
scream
we
lit
a
candle
and
got
out
of
bed
what
is
the
matter
i
asked
are
you
in
pain
no
poppa
she
said
not
in
pain
but
so
frightened
i
kept
hearing
the
bed
creak
and
i
thought
one
of
you
was
coming
out
of
it
to
kill
why
what
nonsense
i
said
you
ve
been
dreaming
again
then
turning
to
my
wife
i
remarked
if
she
has
many
more
of
these
nightmares
we
had
better
send
for
the
doctor
don
t
you
think
so
my
wife
made
no
answer
but
suddenly
gave
a
cry
and
pointed
at
the
bed
otto
she
cried
look
at
the
clothes
we
never
left
them
like
that
what
s
happened
to
them
i
looked
the
clothes
were
all
heaped
together
down
the
centre
of
the
bed
exactly
in
the
shape
of
a
human
body
with
the
face
turned
towards
us
we
all
three
stared
at
it
in
silence
and
the
longer
we
gazed
the
more
pronounced
grew
the
features
until
they
at
last
became
so
lifelike
so
evil
that
my
wife
and
i
instinctively
shrank
back
against
the
child
s
cot
and
tried
to
hide
the
thing
from
her
my
wife
declares
she
saw
it
it
did
jansen
said
i
saw
it
distinctly
shift
nearer
to
us
so
did
i
know
you
were
both
agreed
on
that
point
jansen
went
on
all
i
can
say
is
i
didn
t
see
it
do
that
but
i
started
praying
and
whether
it
was
the
effect
of
my
prayers
or
not
the
clothes
gradually
became
clothes
again
and
after
soothing
bertha
we
scrambled
back
into
bed
feeling
rather
ashamed
we
had
been
so
frightened
the
following
evening
after
bertha
had
been
put
to
bed
we
heard
her
scream
again
and
we
ran
up
and
found
her
quivering
under
the
bedclothes
she
said
our
bed
had
begun
rattling
just
as
if
we
were
moving
in
it
on
turning
to
examine
it
we
found
the
clothes
just
as
we
had
seen
them
in
the
night
with
one
of
the
pillows
pressed
and
moulded
into
the
speaking
likeness
of
a
face
as
i
looked
at
it
the
features
became
convulsed
with
such
an
indescribable
expression
of
hellishness
that
i
backed
against
the
table
and
upset
the
light
on
it
the
thing
on
the
bed
had
disappeared
and
the
clothes
were
once
again
normal
that
same
night
some
time
after
we
were
in
bed
i
awoke
to
find
myself
being
roughly
shaken
by
the
shoulders
it
was
my
wife
but
perhaps
i
had
better
let
her
go
on
with
the
i
shook
him
jansen
explained
because
a
feeling
had
suddenly
come
over
me
that
i
must
kill
bertha
the
very
first
night
we
slept
in
the
room
i
became
obsessed
with
a
passionate
desire
to
see
someone
die
a
desire
that
i
can
assure
you
was
absolutely
novel
to
me
because
i
flatter
myself
i
am
naturally
and
extremely
sensitive
to
seeing
other
people
she
s
kindness
itself
jansen
observed
well
jansen
went
on
the
feeling
became
so
unbearable
that
fearing
i
should
actually
be
compelled
to
kill
someone
i
awoke
my
husband
and
begged
him
to
tie
my
hands
together
which
after
some
hesitation
he
did
bertha
was
crying
bitterly
and
told
us
she
had
again
heard
creaks
in
the
room
just
as
if
someone
was
getting
out
of
bed
to
murder
her
that
was
the
last
time
we
slept
in
the
room
i
felt
it
was
a
positive
danger
to
spend
another
night
in
it
and
so
we
removed
into
the
one
we
are
sleeping
in
and
has
it
never
been
occupied
since
i
asked
yes
for
one
night
jansen
replied
a
niece
of
mine
charlotte
came
to
stay
with
us
and
as
we
had
nowhere
else
to
put
her
she
had
to
sleep
there
we
went
to
bed
rather
late
that
night
and
i
dreamed
three
times
in
succession
that
charlotte
was
creeping
down
the
stairs
with
some
strange
weapon
in
her
hand
with
which
she
intended
killing
bertha
bertha
was
then
sleeping
alone
in
the
room
facing
ours
the
third
dream
was
so
vivid
that
i
awoke
from
it
bathed
with
perspiration
i
told
my
husband
and
he
said
well
that
s
curious
for
i
thought
i
heard
someone
moving
about
overhead
i
ll
go
and
see
if
anything
is
he
opened
the
door
and
going
on
to
the
landing
discovered
charlotte
tiptoeing
cautiously
down
the
stairs
holding
a
long
glittering
pair
of
scissors
in
her
hand
and
with
an
expression
on
her
face
similar
to
that
on
the
face
in
the
bedclothes
what
are
you
doing
here
my
husband
demanded
and
charlotte
at
once
dropped
the
scissors
and
began
crying
she
told
us
that
no
sooner
had
she
got
into
bed
than
she
felt
like
another
person
it
was
just
as
if
someone
else
s
soul
had
crept
into
her
body
all
her
old
sentiments
and
ideals
vanished
and
the
maddest
and
most
unholy
ideas
presented
themselves
in
rapid
succession
to
her
mind
a
blind
hatred
of
everyone
in
the
house
possessed
her
and
she
was
seized
with
the
most
ungovernable
craving
to
kill
for
a
long
time
she
fought
against
this
mania
until
at
last
unable
to
restrain
it
any
longer
she
got
out
of
bed
and
sought
some
weapon
cold
hands
she
declared
seemed
to
guide
her
to
the
scissors
and
armed
with
them
she
crept
downstairs
just
as
i
had
seen
her
in
my
sleep
determined
to
butcher
bertha
first
and
then
if
possible
my
husband
and
myself
she
pleaded
our
forgiveness
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
go
home
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
do
not
feel
i
am
responsible
for
my
behaviour
she
said
i
never
had
the
slightest
inclination
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
before
i
am
sure
it
s
that
room
there
s
some
sinister
influence
in
it
and
if
i
go
back
to
it
i
m
certain
i
shall
do
something
she
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
on
the
sofa
in
the
parlour
and
shortly
before
noon
returned
to
her
parents
after
that
we
locked
up
the
room
and
had
this
chest
placed
against
the
door
as
you
now
see
do
you
know
the
history
of
the
house
i
asked
only
that
before
we
came
here
jansen
said
there
were
several
sudden
deaths
i
do
not
think
any
of
them
were
actually
attributed
to
murder
though
they
were
all
due
to
rather
extraordinary
accidents
originally
i
believe
the
house
was
an
inn
kept
by
a
woman
who
bore
a
very
evil
reputation
and
we
have
always
wondered
if
the
hauntings
had
anything
to
do
with
i
suppose
you
couldn
t
tell
whether
the
face
formed
by
the
bedclothes
was
a
man
or
a
woman
s
i
remarked
not
perhaps
by
the
actual
features
she
responded
only
by
the
expression
i
can
t
explain
how
but
it
was
an
expression
which
at
once
explained
to
me
its
sex
and
that
sex
was
not
as
i
have
said
this
was
not
the
only
case
of
haunting
in
west
quay
that
i
heard
of
during
this
visit
of
mine
to
new
york
but
it
is
the
only
one
of
sufficient
interest
to
note
here
two
equally
interesting
cases
perhaps
came
my
way
when
i
was
travelling
west
the
one
was
in
boston
the
other
in
chicago
i
will
deal
with
the
chicago
one
first
a
banker
in
chicago
to
whom
i
had
a
letter
of
introduction
hearing
that
i
was
interested
in
ghosts
showed
me
a
house
close
to
michigan
avenue
where
he
had
had
a
somewhat
novel
experience
some
years
ago
he
said
that
house
had
the
reputation
for
being
very
badly
haunted
and
not
by
one
ghost
but
by
dozens
it
was
then
occupied
by
an
eccentric
old
millionaire
whom
i
will
call
hoonigan
hoonigan
had
a
very
curious
hobby
in
a
room
which
he
named
duckdom
he
had
a
collection
of
the
most
exquisitely
wrought
models
of
women
clad
in
costumes
which
must
surely
have
cost
thousands
of
pounds
they
were
all
made
in
paris
and
many
of
them
had
once
stood
in
windows
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
i
have
never
seen
anything
to
equal
them
their
eyes
hair
and
finger
nails
were
not
only
beautifully
coloured
and
moulded
they
were
most
natural
and
hoonigan
worshipped
them
he
used
to
spend
hours
a
day
sitting
before
each
of
them
in
turn
fondling
their
hands
and
making
love
to
them
in
the
most
exaggerated
fashion
mad
yes
of
course
he
was
mad
but
his
madness
did
not
always
take
such
a
harmless
form
in
a
room
opposite
duckdom
which
he
named
devildom
he
had
collected
the
fifty
or
murderers
and
other
criminals
of
the
lowest
type
besides
a
heterogeneous
assortment
of
the
most
revolting
objects
amongst
these
objects
were
images
of
the
south
sea
islands
and
mexican
gods
figures
in
wood
and
stone
representing
ghosts
and
demons
cases
full
of
mummies
and
skeletons
weapons
that
had
once
belonged
to
murderers
and
still
bore
traces
of
their
victims
blood
scalping
and
flaying
knives
and
a
variety
of
ancient
instruments
of
torture
whilst
to
accentuate
the
horror
of
the
room
as
a
whole
paintings
such
as
only
a
brain
in
the
most
advanced
stage
of
morbid
disease
could
have
conceived
covered
the
walls
hoonigan
did
not
make
a
practice
of
showing
his
collections
promiscuously
he
was
far
too
jealous
of
them
and
i
do
not
suppose
there
were
ten
people
in
chicago
who
knew
of
their
existence
indeed
it
was
only
with
the
very
greatest
difficulty
that
i
got
his
permission
to
view
them
he
allowed
no
servants
to
sleep
in
the
house
and
when
i
went
there
one
evening
to
see
his
treasures
he
opened
the
door
to
me
himself
do
you
see
this
he
cackled
pointing
to
the
brown
muzzle
of
a
revolver
which
showed
itself
from
under
his
coat
well
i
have
two
more
of
them
and
the
house
is
full
of
pitfalls
all
admirable
inventions
of
my
own
and
warranted
to
upset
the
calculations
of
even
the
most
experienced
have
you
ever
been
troubled
by
burglars
i
asked
glancing
over
the
shoulders
of
the
queer
old
figure
before
me
and
letting
my
eyes
wander
round
the
great
hall
dimly
lighted
and
full
of
many
suggestive
nooks
yes
several
times
he
said
and
once
one
actually
got
in
he
is
here
here
now
i
cried
why
you
surely
don
t
mean
to
say
that
you
ve
reformed
him
and
kept
him
as
your
servant
mr
hoonigan
chuckled
and
his
yellow
fangs
reminded
me
unpleasantly
of
the
blunt
and
rusty
teeth
of
a
saw
not
exactly
he
said
he
fell
into
one
of
my
traps
you
will
see
him
later
in
my
little
chamber
of
horrors
he
s
been
there
ever
this
seemed
a
trifle
indiscreet
but
hoonigan
knew
he
could
trust
me
you
see
i
was
his
banker
and
business
means
business
in
chicago
but
come
he
continued
i
will
show
you
duckdom
first
because
you
will
then
the
better
appreciate
its
opposite
there
is
nothing
like
contrasts
to
teach
you
true
he
stepped
into
an
elevator
and
we
went
up
passing
storey
after
storey
all
dark
silent
and
deserted
at
last
we
stopped
and
getting
out
entered
a
brilliantly
illuminated
room
here
they
are
hoonigan
exclaimed
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
fair
women
i
looked
round
and
there
before
me
was
a
vast
assemblage
of
women
all
of
them
richly
dressed
in
the
very
latest
fashion
all
beautiful
however
and
all
most
artistically
posed
some
sitting
some
standing
some
lying
at
full
length
on
rugs
and
sofas
they
were
so
absolutely
natural
that
it
took
me
some
seconds
to
realise
they
were
only
in
wax
hoonigan
approached
one
and
taking
its
hand
pressed
it
reverently
when
i
die
he
said
i
shall
be
placed
here
and
the
room
shall
be
hermetically
sealed
i
want
no
other
he
then
took
me
across
the
landing
to
another
room
i
had
been
prepared
for
a
shock
but
not
for
the
kind
of
shock
i
got
when
the
door
opened
and
a
hell
seething
with
thousand
times
more
devilish
than
the
devilry
of
dante
s
suddenly
thrust
under
my
very
nose
i
recoiled
and
hoonigan
perceiving
my
fright
playfully
pushed
me
in
when
we
were
well
in
the
midst
of
them
he
pointed
with
great
glee
to
several
of
the
most
notorious
murderers
and
insisted
upon
my
picking
up
and
examining
their
weapons
he
then
made
me
sit
on
a
garotting
chair
which
he
had
quite
recently
purchased
in
cuba
and
when
i
was
thus
seated
he
thrust
a
skull
on
my
knee
which
he
said
was
that
of
a
red
indian
chief
who
had
for
certain
skinned
alive
with
his
own
hands
a
whole
family
of
whites
by
this
time
as
you
may
think
i
had
had
enough
of
it
but
as
hoonigan
truly
remarked
there
was
so
much
to
be
seen
besides
he
must
he
said
whilst
i
was
there
show
me
a
stock
of
engravings
which
he
had
just
bought
in
madrid
they
dated
from
the
reign
of
philip
and
represented
in
grim
detail
all
the
horrors
of
the
spanish
inquisition
but
this
was
not
all
their
chief
interest
according
to
hoonigan
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
quote
hoonigan
s
own
just
as
an
hors
d
≈ìuvre
don
t
you
know
used
to
give
them
to
their
victims
to
examine
before
they
commenced
to
torture
them
at
the
conclusion
of
this
exhibition
i
managed
somehow
to
get
away
and
was
walking
to
the
elevator
when
i
saw
something
slink
past
us
i
turned
round
and
in
the
gloom
could
only
see
indistinctly
the
form
of
a
man
of
medium
height
with
a
brutal
figure
and
ambling
gait
i
could
not
see
his
face
he
seemed
to
walk
right
through
the
door
which
was
shut
into
the
room
we
had
just
vacated
what
is
it
hoonigan
asked
somewhat
nervously
i
told
him
ah
he
said
that
s
only
one
of
them
and
one
of
the
least
terrifying
you
didn
t
know
i
suppose
that
the
house
is
haunted
from
your
description
i
should
say
that
what
you
have
just
seen
is
the
ghost
of
the
burglar
i
told
you
about
but
there
are
other
you
like
to
term
them
are
most
troublesome
i
have
had
to
give
up
sleeping
on
this
landing
i
sleep
on
the
ground
floor
now
with
the
electric
light
full
on
all
the
case
of
the
boston
ghost
came
to
my
notice
in
a
very
direct
fashion
i
only
stayed
in
the
town
two
nights
and
chance
led
me
to
put
up
in
an
hotel
which
i
learned
bore
an
undeniable
reputation
for
being
haunted
it
was
in
rather
a
poor
least
poor
for
there
were
few
visitors
indeed
on
the
landing
where
i
slept
no
one
i
spent
all
my
first
day
in
the
town
and
visiting
relatives
whom
i
had
never
met
before
and
i
did
not
get
back
to
the
hotel
till
very
late
the
place
was
dimly
lit
and
oppressively
silent
am
i
the
last
in
i
asked
the
night
porter
who
rubbed
his
eyes
wearily
and
yawned
yes
sir
he
said
the
other
guests
have
been
gone
to
bed
two
hours
or
more
it
s
close
on
what
part
of
ireland
do
you
come
from
i
enquired
county
limerick
to
be
sure
he
said
but
you
couldn
t
tell
i
was
irish
at
once
i
said
what
were
you
over
there
i
was
working
on
the
roads
he
said
and
before
that
i
was
in
the
the
what
date
i
enquired
he
told
me
and
it
then
transpired
that
he
had
enlisted
in
that
regiment
when
one
of
my
uncles
was
a
major
in
it
and
he
remembered
him
well
we
were
thus
talking
away
and
recalling
episodes
of
the
long
past
when
i
heard
a
familiar
sliding
kind
of
noise
and
broke
off
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
surely
that
s
the
elevator
i
exclaimed
i
hope
our
talking
has
not
disturbed
illustration
but
there
are
other
you
like
to
term
them
are
more
troublesome
i
don
t
think
so
sir
he
said
at
any
rate
i
shouldn
t
trouble
myself
about
his
voice
sounded
so
strange
i
thought
and
there
was
such
an
odd
furtive
look
in
his
eyes
that
i
became
curious
and
walking
across
the
hall
arrived
on
the
other
side
just
in
time
to
see
the
elevator
come
slowly
and
softly
down
to
my
astonishment
there
was
no
one
in
it
how
s
that
happened
i
remarked
no
one
called
it
and
had
they
done
so
we
must
have
seen
i
can
t
say
sir
the
porter
replied
looking
very
uneasy
well
it
s
certainly
rather
odd
i
ejaculated
anyhow
it
s
chosen
to
come
down
at
a
very
convenient
and
getting
in
i
went
up
the
following
night
i
returned
late
and
entered
the
vestibule
of
the
hotel
just
as
the
elevator
stopped
does
it
come
down
at
the
same
time
every
night
i
asked
the
porter
yes
sir
he
muttered
every
and
the
reason
must
of
course
be
some
reason
an
elevator
can
t
start
off
unless
someone
or
something
starts
he
was
silent
i
see
there
s
some
mystery
attached
to
it
i
persisted
what
is
it
tell
he
remained
obdurate
for
some
seconds
but
eventually
succumbed
for
goodness
sake
don
t
let
on
sir
he
said
because
the
boss
has
forbidden
any
of
the
staff
to
mention
it
and
if
he
found
out
i
d
told
you
he
d
sack
me
at
once
this
hotel
is
haunted
several
years
ago
before
my
time
a
visitor
arrived
here
late
one
night
and
was
found
by
the
day
porter
dead
in
the
lift
how
he
died
was
never
exactly
known
it
was
rumoured
he
had
either
committed
suicide
or
been
murdered
it
was
never
found
out
who
he
was
or
where
he
came
from
and
as
he
had
no
money
on
him
he
was
buried
like
a
pauper
well
sir
ever
since
then
that
elevator
has
taken
it
into
its
head
to
set
itself
in
motion
at
the
same
time
every
night
sometimes
the
gates
clang
just
as
if
someone
were
getting
in
and
out
at
first
i
usedn
t
to
like
it
at
all
you
can
imagine
perhaps
what
it
s
like
to
know
that
you
are
the
only
person
about
in
a
place
of
this
then
to
hear
the
elevator
suddenly
beginning
to
descend
however
by
degrees
i
got
accustomed
to
it
and
if
that
was
all
that
happened
i
shouldn
t
what
else
does
happen
i
asked
i
can
t
tell
you
sir
would
you
like
a
bit
of
exercise
i
don
t
mind
i
said
why
will
you
try
the
staircase
then
instead
of
the
elevator
count
the
stairs
and
note
carefully
when
you
come
to
the
i
agreed
the
stairs
were
narrow
and
tortuous
the
light
meagre
and
soon
i
began
to
feel
very
very
far
from
my
friend
the
porter
and
very
much
alone
in
the
building
this
feeling
increased
the
further
i
proceeded
until
at
last
it
became
so
unbearable
that
i
involuntarily
halted
i
had
conscientiously
counted
the
steps
i
was
at
the
i
looked
around
me
high
over
head
was
a
kind
of
funnel
formed
of
black
funereal
and
apparently
banisters
below
me
was
a
similarly
constructed
pit
the
flickering
brought
into
play
innumerable
shadows
i
tried
to
look
away
from
them
for
their
gambols
were
unpleasantly
emphasized
by
the
ominously
oppressive
silence
but
they
fascinated
me
to
such
an
extent
that
i
was
forced
to
watch
them
and
whilst
i
was
thus
engaged
i
became
suddenly
aware
of
a
presence
something
i
could
not
see
was
standing
on
the
staircase
a
few
steps
ahead
barring
my
way
i
advanced
one
step
and
with
a
tremendous
effort
i
struggled
on
to
the
next
one
then
the
most
frightful
the
most
overwhelming
diabolical
terror
seized
me
and
turning
round
i
tore
downstairs
well
the
door
porter
said
you
ve
come
back
couldn
t
pass
it
no
one
who
tries
to
do
so
at
this
time
of
night
ever
what
is
it
i
gasped
what
is
the
beastly
thing
i
don
t
know
he
replied
no
one
knows
this
place
was
once
a
madhouse
i
believe
and
ah
well
i
said
i
can
understand
it
now
thank
goodness
i
m
leaving
and
as
it
s
a
choice
of
two
evils
i
ll
go
up
in
the
chapter
vii
a
haunted
wood
and
a
haunted
quarry
in
canada
all
my
ghostly
experiences
in
the
united
states
were
of
indoor
hauntings
consisting
mostly
of
the
visitation
of
phantasms
of
the
dead
who
in
earthly
form
had
either
suffered
or
committed
some
deed
of
violence
i
never
met
with
a
psychic
experience
though
i
only
too
well
realised
the
possibilities
of
such
when
i
was
sleeping
by
myself
on
the
ranche
in
oregon
or
riding
alone
through
the
giant
forests
of
the
cascades
mountains
i
believe
all
the
loneliest
parts
of
america
the
great
bold
rockies
the
vast
californian
and
oregon
forests
are
periodically
visited
by
of
murdered
soldiers
of
indians
of
tramp
all
manner
of
white
and
red
people
and
of
neutrarians
spirits
that
have
never
inhabited
earthly
bodies
and
which
are
as
grotesque
and
as
the
fantastically
carved
boulders
and
queerly
shaped
tree
trunks
with
which
those
parts
are
so
lavishly
bestrewn
america
indeed
affords
one
of
the
wildest
fields
in
the
world
for
the
genuine
ghost
hunter
i
use
the
word
genuine
advisedly
for
i
would
differentiate
between
the
ghost
hunter
who
is
genuine
and
the
professor
of
physics
who
expects
the
unknown
to
be
subservient
to
his
beck
and
call
i
say
then
for
the
ghost
hunter
with
a
kindly
sympathetic
nature
the
ghost
hunter
whose
thoughts
are
more
often
on
the
spiritual
than
the
material
plane
and
who
would
earnestly
seek
the
chance
to
succour
and
comfort
a
lost
soul
the
united
states
of
america
gives
the
greatest
scope
from
what
i
have
heard
for
i
have
never
been
there
canada
also
is
a
much
haunted
country
an
account
of
a
haunting
there
was
given
me
by
a
french
canadian
bertram
armand
whom
i
met
with
his
wife
one
day
at
an
hotel
in
new
york
though
born
and
educated
in
canada
he
had
served
in
the
french
army
and
had
spent
a
considerable
portion
of
his
life
in
france
and
algiers
he
had
now
retired
and
it
was
on
the
occasion
of
his
quittal
of
the
army
and
return
to
canada
that
the
event
i
am
about
to
narrate
and
which
i
give
as
nearly
as
possible
in
his
own
words
occurred
my
home
he
began
was
in
a
small
town
called
garvois
to
the
of
winnipeg
which
at
the
time
of
my
adventure
some
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
was
nothing
like
the
size
it
is
now
i
am
not
sure
of
the
proper
spelling
of
the
word
as
the
writing
in
my
original
notes
has
become
so
very
illegible
in
places
i
had
got
out
of
the
train
at
winnipeg
and
dined
at
an
hotel
and
the
evening
was
well
set
in
before
i
rose
from
my
comfortable
seat
before
the
fire
and
prepared
for
my
long
tramp
if
you
take
my
advice
sir
the
landlord
said
you
will
avoid
the
wood
of
garvois
after
and
why
pray
i
asked
because
sir
he
responded
because
it
bears
an
evil
an
evil
reputation
i
laughed
ma
foi
it
must
bear
a
very
evil
reputation
a
positively
devilish
reputation
to
frighten
an
old
soldier
like
me
why
man
alive
i
have
served
in
the
french
army
in
the
wildest
regions
of
algiers
for
years
a
wood
with
an
evil
reputation
mille
tonnerres
s
a
joke
i
shan
t
forget
in
a
then
seeing
him
look
glum
i
remarked
for
i
had
no
wish
to
hurt
his
feelings
i
can
appreciate
your
intended
kindness
but
you
see
i
have
been
away
from
home
for
ten
whole
years
and
i
am
dying
to
see
my
father
he
is
the
only
relative
i
you
can
gather
that
i
want
to
go
by
the
quickest
route
and
the
road
through
the
wood
if
i
remember
rightly
is
twice
as
short
as
that
by
the
plain
is
it
not
so
the
landlord
shrugged
his
shoulders
yes
he
said
the
road
over
the
plain
is
it
is
if
you
go
by
it
you
won
t
arrive
at
your
father
s
house
till
morning
but
monsieur
if
you
go
by
the
wood
you
may
never
reach
home
at
i
will
risk
it
i
laughed
there
can
only
be
robbers
or
wolves
and
i
am
prepared
for
either
i
have
these
and
i
tapped
the
ends
of
two
at
all
events
if
anything
happens
i
will
haunt
the
wood
and
you
may
come
and
see
me
au
revoir
i
waved
my
hand
as
i
spoke
and
putting
my
pack
in
the
proper
place
on
my
back
i
stepped
airily
on
to
the
broad
brown
track
leading
to
garvois
within
an
hour
of
my
departure
the
weather
which
had
been
abominably
cloudy
for
the
time
of
the
year
took
a
sudden
turn
for
the
worse
and
the
rain
descended
in
torrents
i
chuckled
grimly
o
donnell
for
what
after
all
are
the
discomforts
of
sodden
clothes
and
squishy
boots
compared
with
what
a
soldier
has
to
undergo
in
the
sahara
where
the
sun
is
hell
and
the
rain
mon
dieu
what
s
rain
on
and
on
i
tramped
whistling
gaily
and
running
my
hand
over
my
pack
now
and
again
to
see
that
everything
was
safe
i
had
a
present
there
for
my
father
whom
i
loved
more
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
you
see
he
added
with
a
smile
i
hadn
t
met
jacqueline
well
so
long
as
i
kept
to
the
main
track
there
was
not
much
to
complain
had
recently
been
attended
to
but
the
moment
i
turned
off
it
and
on
to
the
side
one
leading
to
the
wood
my
troubles
began
deep
ruts
big
holes
huge
earth
mounds
and
stones
made
it
bad
enough
in
dry
weather
it
was
now
a
quagmire
that
afforded
every
possibility
of
soon
becoming
dangerous
i
had
seen
nothing
like
it
since
i
was
in
algiers
but
bah
a
soldier
can
get
used
to
anything
it
is
a
mere
nothing
i
said
to
myself
i
can
dive
i
can
swim
it
will
take
more
than
cold
water
to
kill
me
and
if
it
were
twenty
times
as
bad
i
would
face
ten
years
is
a
long
time
to
be
away
from
one
s
home
o
donnell
i
trudged
on
and
was
soon
in
black
mud
at
eight
o
clock
i
was
confronted
by
a
long
line
of
huge
black
trees
that
bent
their
dripping
tops
as
if
they
had
orders
to
salute
me
coming
to
a
halt
and
leaning
against
a
slender
isolated
pine
that
creaked
and
groaned
in
the
rough
night
air
i
ruefully
surveyed
the
prospect
in
front
of
me
the
track
through
the
wood
was
twelve
of
a
walk
if
i
had
been
fresh
and
the
weather
dry
but
in
my
present
condition
a
seemingly
impossible
one
for
the
last
hour
or
so
i
had
experienced
nothing
but
a
recurrence
of
slips
and
falls
i
had
done
nothing
but
plunge
in
and
out
of
abysses
and
i
had
been
completely
battered
to
pieces
by
the
wind
and
the
rain
i
can
stand
any
amount
of
heat
o
donnell
but
wet
no
it
gets
into
every
pore
of
my
skin
and
completely
demoralises
me
i
was
exhausted
almost
at
the
end
of
my
tether
and
i
felt
a
very
little
more
would
see
me
on
the
ground
absolutely
done
now
of
course
i
am
used
to
sleeping
out
of
doors
all
night
but
then
canada
is
not
france
neither
is
it
africa
and
the
warmth
and
dryness
of
the
sahara
had
made
me
terribly
susceptible
to
chills
a
night
in
this
wood
would
mean
for
certain
either
pneumonia
or
rheumatic
i
might
never
get
home
to
see
my
father
so
what
alternative
was
there
only
to
tramp
back
again
over
that
dreadful
track
and
take
the
long
route
over
the
plains
i
couldn
t
do
it
i
hadn
t
the
strength
i
would
struggle
on
i
did
took
the
plunge
the
desert
with
the
lights
twinkling
far
away
on
its
extremities
was
speedily
hidden
from
view
trees
shut
me
in
on
all
sides
i
was
at
last
in
the
forest
i
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
be
nervous
but
the
silence
i
now
experienced
disquieted
me
i
had
never
felt
anything
like
it
it
struck
me
as
an
assumed
purposely
to
cloak
a
and
universal
resentment
moreover
i
had
an
uncomfortable
suspicion
that
it
was
the
prelude
to
something
some
peculiar
antagonistic
demonstration
the
very
nature
of
which
was
at
present
enigmatical
it
was
a
silence
savouring
of
a
world
other
than
a
world
i
knew
nothing
at
that
period
of
my
life
i
was
an
atheist
and
neither
believed
in
a
god
or
a
future
existence
the
rain
pattered
heavily
on
the
foliage
overhead
and
the
wind
groaned
but
the
voices
of
the
beings
in
this
unknown
still
absolutely
still
in
the
gloom
the
trees
assumed
strange
shapes
their
motions
too
were
strange
that
i
did
not
think
they
could
possibly
have
been
caused
by
the
wind
you
may
think
i
am
o
donnell
but
i
do
not
think
i
am
my
wife
would
tell
me
if
i
were
for
she
has
never
been
slow
in
pointing
out
my
faults
have
you
jacqueline
armand
smiled
no
o
donnell
she
said
he
has
many
faults
but
exaggeration
is
not
one
of
them
indeed
he
is
so
precise
as
to
be
sometimes
armand
continued
i
saw
lights
too
o
donnell
he
said
all
kinds
of
coloured
lights
which
i
did
not
then
attribute
to
possible
spirit
agency
i
simply
did
not
know
what
they
were
i
was
not
afraid
but
i
became
wary
and
moved
furtively
forward
as
if
i
had
been
scouting
in
some
enemy
s
country
every
now
and
then
i
fancied
i
heard
soft
steps
that
i
could
associate
with
nothing
human
stealing
surreptitiously
behind
me
i
paused
and
looked
carefully
over
my
shoulder
but
there
was
nothing
the
gloom
at
length
the
darkness
became
so
intense
that
i
could
no
longer
see
the
track
i
continued
to
advance
however
and
after
plunging
through
a
succession
of
bogs
and
briars
was
finally
brought
to
a
peremptory
halt
by
a
stone
wall
this
wall
was
four
feet
or
so
in
height
but
what
lay
on
the
other
side
of
it
or
where
indeed
it
began
or
ended
it
was
impossible
to
decide
and
i
was
wondering
what
on
earth
i
had
better
do
my
energy
was
nearly
a
voice
suddenly
called
out
keep
along
by
the
wall
and
i
will
meet
you
at
the
wicket
gate
overjoyed
i
obeyed
the
wall
swerved
sharply
round
and
a
few
yards
beyond
with
one
hand
on
the
gate
and
in
the
other
a
dark
lantern
stood
the
slight
figure
of
a
woman
in
a
few
words
i
explained
the
in
the
blinding
rain
and
darkness
of
the
forest
i
had
lost
my
way
and
was
too
exhausted
to
go
any
further
i
don
t
mind
sleeping
anywhere
i
pleaded
so
long
as
i
can
lie
where
it
is
dry
and
rest
till
morning
an
attic
barn
anything
will
i
think
i
can
offer
you
something
better
than
that
the
woman
responded
as
she
led
me
through
the
gate
and
along
a
narrow
winding
path
to
a
large
low
house
whose
black
walls
rising
suddenly
out
of
the
ground
before
me
seemed
startlingly
familiar
my
guide
key
turned
a
door
flew
was
a
rush
of
strange
musty
air
and
almost
before
i
had
time
to
realise
it
i
was
inside
the
building
i
must
apologise
for
the
absence
of
light
the
woman
said
but
under
the
circumstances
the
omission
is
unavoidable
if
we
had
been
expecting
you
it
would
of
course
have
been
different
if
you
will
follow
me
i
will
take
you
to
your
i
tried
to
see
her
face
to
make
out
what
she
was
like
but
i
was
frustrated
in
my
desire
by
the
way
in
which
she
held
the
lantern
nor
was
i
any
more
fortunate
in
the
discernment
of
my
surroundings
i
could
see
the
ground
at
my
feet
but
no
more
shrouded
in
an
impenetrable
sable
mantle
the
curious
feeling
that
i
had
been
there
before
that
i
knew
the
house
well
again
came
over
me
although
prior
to
now
i
had
never
seen
any
habitation
in
the
wood
nor
even
known
that
one
existed
i
argued
it
was
probably
a
peculiar
odour
in
the
atmosphere
that
had
conjured
back
memories
of
some
other
and
quite
distinct
place
but
i
had
not
much
time
for
speculation
as
the
woman
s
movements
were
very
quick
and
i
had
barely
scraped
the
thickest
of
the
mud
from
off
my
feet
before
she
had
begun
to
ascend
a
staircase
we
crossed
what
i
took
to
be
a
landing
and
stepped
some
score
or
so
paces
down
a
corridor
finally
halting
before
a
doorway
there
is
your
room
she
said
you
need
have
no
linen
is
well
aired
and
of
course
she
added
slightly
sniffing
you
may
if
you
like
open
the
windows
we
have
been
obliged
to
keep
them
closed
owing
to
the
damp
she
turned
to
go
and
just
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
i
saw
her
face
it
was
exquisite
my
wife
will
pardon
me
for
saying
my
wildest
dreams
of
woman
s
beauty
were
not
merely
rivalled
they
were
surpassed
i
doubt
even
if
so
great
a
painter
of
feminine
charms
as
richter
could
have
done
her
credit
who
was
she
i
kept
asking
myself
that
question
long
after
she
had
left
me
and
the
echoes
of
her
shoes
along
the
passage
and
down
the
stairs
had
ceased
who
was
she
ma
foi
the
vision
of
such
loveliness
would
never
leave
me
i
would
enjoy
them
over
and
over
again
in
my
sleep
indeed
i
was
so
obsessed
with
her
face
that
i
paid
little
or
no
heed
to
the
novelty
of
the
situation
at
other
times
i
might
have
queried
the
desirability
of
being
in
a
strange
bedroom
in
a
strange
the
dark
but
the
knowledge
she
was
near
at
hand
was
quite
enough
for
me
i
was
already
in
love
with
the
queerest
the
most
perplexing
of
predicaments
were
as
nothing
to
me
i
soared
alone
knew
how
high
still
when
i
came
to
argue
it
out
with
myself
it
was
a
bit
of
a
nuisance
my
matches
were
sodden
and
i
could
not
use
them
i
would
have
preferred
seeing
the
bed
upon
which
i
was
to
lie
and
a
spot
where
i
could
lay
my
clothes
i
was
so
afraid
of
soiling
the
upholstery
that
i
undressed
where
i
stood
and
then
making
a
guess
at
the
direction
of
the
bed
walked
cautiously
forward
by
a
piece
of
luck
which
struck
me
as
somewhat
extraordinary
i
collided
with
the
large
brass
immediately
it
was
the
work
of
a
second
to
throw
back
the
sheets
and
scramble
in
between
them
and
then
with
my
mind
full
to
overflowing
with
visions
of
my
goddess
i
entrusted
both
her
and
my
father
to
the
safe
keeping
of
the
virgin
and
the
though
i
had
no
faith
in
a
future
for
sank
into
a
deep
refreshing
sleep
how
long
i
remained
in
that
condition
i
never
knew
i
woke
with
a
start
to
find
the
room
no
longer
dark
but
partially
illuminated
with
a
fitful
red
glow
which
proceeded
from
the
stove
now
full
of
lurid
logs
thinking
i
must
be
dreaming
i
rubbed
my
eyes
but
no
the
fire
was
still
there
and
even
as
i
gazed
at
it
i
caught
the
sound
of
approaching
sharp
of
shoes
nearer
and
nearer
they
came
right
up
to
the
entrance
of
my
room
when
to
my
astonishment
and
no
little
embarrassment
the
door
gently
opened
and
in
the
object
of
my
admiration
in
one
hand
she
carried
a
iron
spoon
and
in
the
other
a
candle
i
was
entranced
now
that
she
had
taken
off
her
hood
and
cloak
beauties
hitherto
concealed
stood
out
in
dazzling
fulness
and
bewitched

and

tiny
ears

my

laughed

men

same

and

o
donnell
more
about

are
right
bertram
armand
exclaimed
she
was
a
least
my
idea
of
one
then
what
did
she
want
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
was
about
to
speak
to
her
when
she
laid
a
finger
on
her
lips
and
smilingly
bade
me
be
silent
she
then
glided
to
the
grate
and
taking
from
her
pocket
a
small
lump
of
lead
carefully
put
it
into
the
spoon
which
she
balanced
with
the
utmost
care
on
the
brightest
of
the
faggots
that
done
she
again
smiled
meaningly
at
me
and
walking
to
the
dainty
strewn
profusely
with
rings
and
bracelets
looked
long
and
critically
at
herself
in
the
mirror
it
was
while
she
was
thus
occupied
that
i
suddenly
became
conscious
of
something
or
someone
close
to
me
in
a
moment
my
heart
ceased
to
beat
in
deadly
fear
i
glanced
round
and
perceived
lying
by
my
side
an
old
man
with
long
grizzled
hair
and
beard
whose
features
were
somehow
vaguely
familiar
to
me
he
was
sound
fact
betrayed
by
his
breathing
which
was
loud
and
stertorious
a
slight
movement
from
the
other
part
of
the
room
attracting
my
attention
i
looked
up
just
in
time
to
see
the
girl
flash
me
a
look
of
subtle
warning
don
t
wake
him
whatever
you
do
her
eyes
said
he
sleep
don
t
wake
him
i
repeated
to
myself
why
of
course
i
won
t
i
wouldn
t
do
matter
you
told
me
not
to
i
would
obey
you
even
at
the
risk
of
life
and
soul
dieu
en
ciel
how
lovely
one
daintily
clad
foot
and
then
the
girl
approached
the
stove
she
lifted
the
spoon
carefully
from
the
fire
bore
it
steadily
before
her
to
the
bed
and
gaily
motioning
to
me
to
keep
quiet
she
gently
turned
the
sleeper
s
head
over
on
the
pillow
and
with
a
dexterous
movement
of
her
clever
supple
fingers
poured
the
seething
hissing
lead
into
his
ear
there
was
an
agonising
eyes
of
the
old
man
opened
convulsively
and
in
the
brief
glimpse
i
caught
of
them
i
recognised
my
father
illustration
i
looked
up
just
in
time
to
see
the
girl
flash
me
a
look
of
subtle
warning
almost
simultaneously
came
a
loud
crash
blinding
darkness
and
i
was
once
again
in
the
knows
my
way
laboriously
along
the
track
at
early
dawn
i
arrived
within
sight
of
bathed
in
a
cold
grey
mist
and
a
little
later
i
dragged
myself
with
difficulty
towards
the
wicket
gate
leading
to
my
father
s
house
to
my
intense
surprise
it
was
padlocked
but
the
mystery
explained
itself
at
upright
in
the
garden
was
a
bearing
the
inscription
to
be
let
or
i
swayed
on
my
feet
as
i
looked
at
it
and
with
a
bursting
heart
reeled
away
to
the
nearest
house
of
my
old
friend
henry
crozier
henry
had
just
invariably
got
up
at
shuffling
downstairs
he
opened
the
door
le
diable
he
exclaimed
if
it
isn
t
bertram
ma
foi
i
was
dreaming
of
you
last
night
so
you
ve
come
back
come
back
to
find
the
place
empty
i
murmured
but
tell
me
my
friend
where
s
my
father
henry
s
eyes
grew
round
with
astonishment
what
he
said
what
you
don
t
know
then
seeing
my
look
of
utter
stupefaction
he
added
my
poor
bertram
your
father
is
dead
he
died
a
fortnight
ago
the
very
day
after
his
marriage
with
mademoiselle
marie
dernille
the
niece
of
his
last
housekeeper
what
killed
him
apoplexy
it
does
not
do
to
dispute
the
but
the
woman
what
was
she
like
i
stuttered
why
harry
enunciated
slowly
she
was
what
some
people
would
call
beautiful
though
as
god
is
my
judge
i
did
not
admire
her
fair
very
fair
a
mass
of
yellow
hair
painted
yes
anyone
could
see
they
were
big
very
big
and
of
a
this
was
bertram
armand
s
account
of
his
experience
in
answer
to
my
questions
he
told
me
that
he
had
searched
the
wood
thoroughly
but
there
was
no
house
of
any
sort
in
it
and
afterwards
having
had
his
father
s
body
secretly
exhumed
and
finding
lead
in
the
ear
he
had
obtained
an
order
for
the
arrest
of
his
she
was
however
nowhere
to
be
found
and
he
supposed
that
having
got
wind
of
the
affair
she
had
escaped
out
of
the
country
armand
told
his
story
with
every
appearance
of
sincerity
and
as
i
could
see
that
his
wife
believed
it
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
that
it
was
true
the
case
of
another
haunting
in
canada
was
told
me
on
my
way
out
to
the
states
on
board
one
of
the
white
star
liners
my
place
at
table
was
next
to
a
doctor
and
fanshawe
both
canadians
who
hearing
that
i
was
interested
in
everything
connected
with
the
superphysical
told
me
that
they
had
had
several
rather
curious
experiences
the
doctor
took
from
his
a
small
leather
purse
and
opening
it
showed
me
a
dull
blue
stone
are
you
a
geologist
he
asked
no
i
replied
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
stones
what
is
it
no
one
has
ever
been
able
to
tell
me
he
said
i
have
shown
it
to
several
professors
at
the
english
universities
and
they
have
each
classified
it
differently
not
one
of
them
i
believe
had
ever
seen
or
even
heard
of
a
stone
like
it
and
for
a
very
simple
reason
in
canada
there
is
much
soil
that
has
never
been
disturbed
and
many
tracts
of
land
no
white
man
has
ever
trod
but
let
me
explain
how
the
stone
came
into
my
possession
five
years
ago
we
took
a
house
situated
about
four
or
five
miles
from
montreal
it
was
a
long
low
two
storey
house
standing
a
little
back
from
the
road
and
connected
with
it
by
a
sweep
of
gravel
road
opposite
the
house
was
a
large
pit
where
quarrying
had
recently
been
begun
but
had
been
discontinued
owing
to
the
calcinous
nature
of
the
rock
which
rendered
it
of
little
use
for
building
purposes
incessant
rains
had
formed
a
deep
pool
in
the
bottom
of
the
pit
and
the
water
possessed
this
weather
made
no
difference
to
its
was
icy
cold
in
summer
and
winter
alike
viewed
in
the
the
quarry
struck
one
as
ordinary
enough
it
was
at
dusk
when
the
shadows
from
the
trees
and
bushes
swept
across
the
road
and
dimmed
the
mouth
of
the
great
pit
that
it
impressed
one
as
unsavoury
i
remember
marvelling
at
this
metamorphosis
the
first
day
of
our
arrival
it
was
july
and
the
landscape
was
vividly
aglow
with
brilliant
scintillating
sunbeams
a
more
radiant
scene
you
could
not
imagine
one
might
make
a
capital
swimming
bath
of
this
i
remarked
to
my
wife
as
we
wandered
to
the
edge
of
the
pit
and
peered
down
into
the
silent
sparkling
water
yes
she
laughed
supposing
we
start
right
away
i
never
appreciate
a
bath
more
than
after
a
that
was
in
the
morning
in
the
evening
the
place
produced
a
very
different
impression
we
had
sort
of
scratch
meal
one
must
expect
when
one
is
moving
in
and
i
had
strolled
out
alone
i
first
of
all
explored
the
premises
there
was
a
big
garden
with
an
orchard
alongside
and
a
small
field
beyond
and
i
pictured
to
myself
how
nice
it
would
all
look
when
the
grass
was
properly
cut
and
the
planted
by
my
wife
who
by
the
way
thoroughly
understands
landscape
gardening
you
do
don
t
you
mabel
fanshawe
nodded
and
her
husband
resumed
his
story
i
lit
another
cigar
and
walked
out
into
the
road
to
have
a
look
at
the
quarry
i
hardly
recognised
it
it
seemed
since
the
morning
to
have
undergone
a
complete
change
the
banks
appeared
higher
and
more
precipitous
the
water
blacker
and
infinitely
deeper
and
there
was
a
cold
dreariness
about
the
place
that
made
me
shiver
i
thought
i
had
never
viewed
anything
so
utterly
forlorn
and
murderous
on
the
opposite
bank
were
a
few
rank
sedges
and
several
white
trunks
of
decayed
trees
i
had
not
noticed
them
before
but
now
as
i
gazed
down
at
the
pool
i
saw
their
and
inverted
images
outlined
with
a
clearness
that
more
than
rivalled
that
of
their
material
counterparts
i
was
pondering
over
this
phenomenon
when
i
suddenly
felt
i
was
being
watched
and
raising
my
eyes
i
perceived
on
the
bank
facing
me
just
out
of
reach
of
the
water
a
boulder
of
and
rock
i
could
not
see
anything
behind
it
but
i
was
convinced
that
something
was
there
something
that
was
crouching
on
its
haunches
and
glaring
savagely
at
me
i
also
felt
convinced
that
this
thing
which
i
could
not
actually
i
knew
for
certain
it
was
some
strange
hybrid
of
a
man
and
animal
a
thing
with
limbs
like
ours
but
the
face
of
some
fantastic
mocking
malevolent
beast
filled
with
a
great
uneasiness
and
all
manner
of
vague
fears
i
hurried
back
to
the
house
where
all
was
bright
and
cheerful
but
i
could
not
rid
my
mind
of
the
impression
it
had
taken
from
the
pool
and
that
night
my
dreams
were
troubled
and
alarming
i
said
nothing
about
it
to
my
wife
but
two
days
later
when
i
was
mending
my
in
the
study
she
came
to
me
in
a
great
state
of
agitation
why
what
s
the
matter
mabel
i
asked
anxiously
you
look
very
white
are
you
ill
no
she
said
i
ve
only
had
a
at
the
doctor
s
request
fanshawe
then
took
up
the
thread
i
was
walking
down
one
of
the
of
the
garden
she
said
looking
for
ephraim
ephraim
was
our
gardener
when
i
heard
a
great
rustling
of
leaves
i
turned
round
and
saw
a
violent
agitation
going
on
in
the
branches
of
an
much
mystified
as
i
could
see
no
cause
for
it
i
approached
nearer
and
as
i
did
so
i
distinctly
heard
some
heavy
body
drop
to
the
earth
with
a
thud
i
then
felt
something
brush
past
me
i
can
t
exactly
describe
the
sensation
it
caused
because
it
is
beyond
words
i
can
only
say
i
felt
i
was
being
touched
by
something
immeasurably
foul
and
antagonistic
i
reeled
right
back
and
that
moment
someone
spoke
it
was
the
gardener
who
came
running
towards
me
to
ask
if
he
could
go
home
as
his
wife
had
suddenly
been
taken
that
was
all
that
happened
then
no
fanshawe
replied
that
night
after
we
had
been
in
bed
some
time
we
were
awakened
by
hearing
our
newfoundland
dog
pat
bark
i
went
downstairs
to
see
what
was
the
matter
with
slept
in
the
found
him
standing
in
the
hall
with
his
hair
all
erect
looking
at
the
window
by
the
front
door
i
called
to
my
husband
and
he
came
down
with
his
revolver
we
then
both
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
but
could
see
no
one
i
m
sure
pat
sees
something
i
observed
he
is
beside
himself
with
what
is
it
pat
dick
said
and
was
about
to
stroke
him
when
there
came
a
violent
hammering
at
the
door
we
looked
at
one
another
in
dismay
who
s
there
dick
cried
and
there
being
no
reply
he
bullet
going
right
through
the
door
we
threw
it
was
no
one
there
we
then
searched
the
garden
nothing
would
persuade
pat
to
accompany
us
but
we
found
no
one
for
a
week
after
this
incident
we
were
undisturbed
then
all
sorts
of
noises
were
heard
in
the
footsteps
heavy
breathing
the
rattling
of
door
handles
alarming
of
crashes
on
the
door
panels
the
servants
were
terrified
one
of
them
roused
us
one
night
by
loud
shrieks
and
going
to
her
room
we
found
her
in
hysterics
all
the
clothes
had
been
stripped
off
her
bed
and
thrown
in
a
promiscuous
heap
on
the
floor
when
she
recovered
sufficiently
to
speak
she
told
us
something
had
come
into
her
room
and
tried
to
suffocate
felt
just
as
if
all
the
breath
in
her
body
was
being
forcibly
sucked
out
of
her
she
had
seen
nothing
we
told
her
it
was
a
nightmare
and
tried
to
soothe
her
but
our
endeavours
met
with
little
success
and
in
the
morning
she
was
seriously
she
died
within
a
fortnight
and
on
the
same
day
as
the
gardener
s
did
the
gardener
s
wife
live
on
the
premises
too
i
asked
practically
fanshawe
replied
she
and
her
husband
occupied
a
cottage
close
did
both
women
usually
have
good
health
rather
fanshawe
laughed
they
were
as
tough
as
typical
young
canadians
heart
and
lungs
absolutely
sound
i
diagnosed
their
cases
and
was
much
puzzled
on
the
top
of
violent
shocks
which
had
apparently
upset
their
whole
constitution
they
had
developed
acute
an√¶mia
why
do
you
ask
merely
because
of
an
idea
i
replied
but
pray
let
fanshawe
finish
her
story
and
then
if
you
like
i
will
tell
you
what
my
idea
well
fanshawe
continued
i
haven
t
much
more
to
relate
on
the
night
after
our
maid
s
funeral
we
were
again
disturbed
by
pat
barking
i
got
up
and
went
to
the
bedroom
window
the
weather
was
very
unsettled
clouds
scurried
across
the
moon
that
hung
like
a
great
silver
ball
over
the
lawrence
river
which
i
could
see
winding
its
mighty
course
in
the
distance
spots
of
heavy
rain
were
falling
and
the
wind
whistled
dolefully
through
the
leaves
of
the
maples
illustration
the
thing
came
right
up
to
the
window
and
then
raised
its
face
suddenly
i
heard
the
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
crunching
their
way
along
the
gravel
drive
it
will
be
nothing
visible
i
said
to
myself
and
then
i
got
a
pretty
acute
shock
coming
towards
the
house
with
short
quick
steps
was
a
tall
figure
with
its
head
bowed
low
its
arms
and
legs
were
very
long
and
bony
the
feet
and
hands
enormous
it
was
quite
nude
and
from
all
over
its
body
which
was
of
an
exaggerated
whiteness
there
emanated
a
strange
phosphorescent
glow
i
called
to
dick
and
he
at
once
joined
me
the
thing
came
right
up
to
the
window
and
then
raised
its
face
if
i
live
to
be
a
thousand
years
old
i
shall
never
forget
what
i
saw
the
proportion
of
the
face
was
not
human
and
it
was
partially
covered
with
hair
but
the
eyes
were
the
same
shape
as
ours
only
very
much
bigger
they
were
pale
almost
white
i
thought
and
their
don
t
talk
of
it
fanshawe
interrupted
one
can
only
say
it
was
too
damnable
too
utterly
vicious
and
loathsome
for
we
were
so
overcome
his
wife
went
on
that
for
some
seconds
neither
of
us
could
articulate
a
syllable
we
both
stared
at
it
in
hideous
fascination
at
last
it
made
some
slight
movement
and
dick
released
from
the
spell
that
held
him
fired
at
it
the
bullet
must
have
gone
right
through
it
for
we
saw
the
gravel
on
the
path
immediately
behind
it
spurt
up
and
scatter
however
the
figure
was
unharmed
and
it
moved
on
towards
the
front
door
dick
fired
again
but
with
no
better
result
a
fearful
horror
now
seized
us
lest
it
should
get
into
the
house
i
am
not
a
religious
woman
but
i
prayed
and
as
i
did
so
i
saw
dick
throw
something
what
he
threw
seemed
to
strike
the
thing
full
in
the
face
and
it
vanished
as
we
got
back
into
bed
i
said
to
dick
that
was
very
odd
what
did
you
throw
a
stone
i
picked
up
near
the
quarry
this
morning
he
replied
i
don
t
know
why
i
threw
it
but
directly
you
started
praying
a
feeling
came
over
me
that
i
we
were
not
disturbed
again
that
night
but
slept
better
than
we
had
done
for
some
time
and
in
the
morning
dick
found
and
showed
me
the
stone
you
are
looking
at
now
we
had
it
fixed
to
the
front
door
and
after
that
we
were
not
troubled
there
was
no
history
attached
to
the
place
fanshawe
added
and
no
one
we
spoke
to
had
ever
heard
of
its
being
haunted
now
what
do
you
make
of
it
a
fairly
satisfactory
case
i
replied
because
i
think
this
stone
affords
a
clue
to
part
of
the
mystery
at
least
when
i
was
out
in
the
west
i
was
told
by
some
indians
of
the
rogue
river
tribe
whom
i
was
delighted
to
fall
in
with
that
when
a
place
of
theirs
was
haunted
they
kept
the
ghost
quiet
by
burying
a
piece
of
blue
rock
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
lava
beds
of
that
district
but
is
very
rare
now
in
all
probability
this
custom
is
not
confined
to
the
indians
of
one
tribe
but
is
more
or
less
universal
therefore
we
need
not
be
surprised
to
find
a
piece
of
this
blue
rock
buried
but
there
are
no
indians
in
this
neighbourhood
fanshawe
remarked
not
now
i
said
but
undoubtedly
there
were
once
my
supposition
is
that
this
place
has
a
history
it
was
once
badly
haunted
by
spirits
of
the
most
dangerous
type
which
for
want
of
a
better
name
i
will
style
neutrarians
these
neutrarians
are
spirits
that
have
never
inhabited
material
bodies
and
are
only
to
be
found
in
very
remote
and
isolated
districts
where
the
soil
has
rarely
if
ever
been
disturbed
they
are
invariably
antagonistic
to
all
forms
of
animal
life
probably
because
if
they
were
created
first
which
is
quite
feasible
they
regard
man
as
an
interloper
and
probably
also
because
they
covet
man
s
body
and
are
jealous
of
him
many
of
the
indians
believe
that
man
is
descended
from
the
gods
and
neutrarians
from
devils
and
that
the
latter
feel
the
distinction
and
hate
man
accordingly
neutrarians
vary
considerably
both
in
appearance
habits
and
constitution
whilst
some
can
apparently
reveal
themselves
at
will
others
can
only
do
so
by
stealing
vitality
from
human
beings
or
animals
let
us
now
see
how
all
of
this
applies
to
the
present
case
when
you
came
to
your
house
you
did
not
get
the
impression
it
was
haunted
it
was
only
when
you
looked
at
the
was
there
you
received
your
first
they
were
in
all
probability
correct
i
believe
a
great
deal
in
first
impressions
particularly
with
regard
to
the
superphysical
this
theory
too
namely
that
the
hauntings
originated
in
the
quarry
finds
support
in
the
fact
that
you
found
the
blue
stone
close
to
the
quarry
and
that
the
figure
you
both
saw
coming
along
the
carriage
drive
was
coming
from
that
direction
the
blue
stone
i
believe
had
been
buried
there
and
was
dug
up
when
the
quarry
was
made
thus
the
stopper
so
to
speak
which
kept
the
ghost
in
check
being
removed
the
hauntings
of
course
recommenced
belonging
to
the
species
that
can
not
manifest
itself
without
drawing
vitality
from
some
form
or
other
of
animal
life
this
neutrarian
first
attacked
the
gardener
s
wife
and
then
the
maid
selecting
these
two
on
account
of
their
unusual
robustness
had
you
not
thrown
the
blue
stone
at
it
and
afterwards
fixed
the
stone
to
your
door
it
is
more
than
likely
that
you
would
both
have
then
many
diseases
that
have
defied
diagnosis
and
there
are
countless
such
fanshawe
exclaimed
may
very
probably
be
due
to
i
think
it
is
very
likely
i
said
i
have
noticed
for
example
houses
where
several
people
have
been
medically
stated
to
have
died
of
cancer
have
been
haunted
by
disturbances
of
a
parallel
nature
to
those
you
but
are
such
hauntings
to
go
on
for
ever
fanshawe
asked
is
there
no
means
of
putting
an
end
to
them
saving
by
blue
stones
how
about
exorcism
i
am
not
sure
on
that
point
i
said
i
certainly
do
not
think
that
neutrarians
or
the
spirits
of
imbeciles
can
be
exorcised
satisfactorily
as
i
have
known
several
cases
of
hauntings
by
these
spirits
in
which
exorcism
has
been
practised
and
in
no
instance
has
it
had
any
effect
whatsoever
i
should
say
hauntings
by
neutrarians
might
last
indefinitely
i
see
no
reason
why
they
should
not
have
you
made
any
enquiries
lately
about
the
house
no
fanshawe
replied
not
for
some
time
when
we
get
back
to
montreal
we
will
do
so
and
let
you
the
conversation
ended
here
a
year
later
i
received
a
letter
from
her
husband
i
have
been
to
the
house
he
wrote
and
the
present
occupants
are
leaving
almost
immediately
there
have
been
three
deaths
there
during
their
tenancy
and
they
complain
of
exactly
the
same
disturbances
that
alarmed
us
i
have
lent
them
the
blue
chapter
viii
hauntings
in
the
east
end
having
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
earn
a
living
in
america
i
returned
to
england
as
a
steerage
passenger
on
the
german
liner
it
was
the
last
homeward
journey
she
was
destined
to
go
for
she
was
run
into
on
her
next
outward
voyage
by
the
crathie
several
hundred
miles
off
the
east
coast
of
england
and
sunk
with
an
appalling
loss
of
life
the
weather
being
particularly
rough
we
were
about
nine
days
at
sea
and
the
fact
that
our
quarters
were
extremely
close
consisting
of
little
more
than
a
square
foot
to
each
person
coupled
with
food
that
i
could
not
eat
made
me
sincerely
thankful
when
the
time
came
to
go
ashore
apart
from
these
details
i
had
nothing
to
complain
of
in
the
way
i
was
treated
for
the
barely
concealing
their
hearty
contempt
for
all
but
the
to
me
civil
enough
at
the
same
time
the
experience
i
had
not
bargained
one
i
certainly
do
not
desire
to
go
through
again
i
shall
never
forget
how
glad
i
was
to
find
myself
once
more
in
an
english
restaurant
sitting
down
to
a
good
square
english
meal
i
spent
two
nights
in
southampton
travelling
thence
to
london
on
arriving
at
waterloo
i
found
myself
almost
as
embarrassed
as
i
had
been
in
new
york
for
my
knowledge
of
london
was
extremely
limited
i
had
only
been
when
i
was
up
for
my
sandhurst
an
odd
day
occasionally
and
then
i
had
always
stayed
at
a
private
hotel
in
cambridge
street
hyde
park
now
however
my
funds
being
no
longer
equal
to
the
west
end
i
was
forced
to
look
elsewhere
for
a
lodging
after
a
wearisome
search
i
at
last
found
a
room
in
tennyson
street
that
room
will
take
a
lot
of
forgetting
it
was
very
small
very
dark
and
very
beetly
i
could
hear
whole
armies
of
blackbeetles
parading
the
floor
and
scaling
the
walls
occasionally
one
dropped
with
a
thud
seemingly
close
to
me
and
i
sprang
out
of
bed
in
terror
lest
it
had
landed
on
the
counterpane
i
honestly
believe
i
am
as
much
afraid
of
cockroaches
as
i
am
of
ghosts
i
only
stayed
in
that
house
three
days
and
then
moved
into
the
attic
of
a
coffee
tavern
in
york
road
that
was
midway
in
the
nineties
and
york
road
then
was
very
different
from
what
it
is
now
in
the
it
was
full
of
frowsily
dressed
men
and
women
and
the
f≈ìtid
steam
from
the
cheaper
kinds
of
restaurants
i
well
remember
one
shop
that
boasted
of
hot
rabbit
dinners
for
fourpence
and
big
pork
pies
that
had
a
peculiar
fascination
for
were
sold
there
all
the
year
round
for
threepence
i
often
wondered
how
many
people
those
pies
killed
and
how
any
man
could
be
such
a
villain
as
to
sell
them
but
if
york
road
was
mean
and
squalid
in
the
it
was
infinitely
worse
at
night
i
have
never
in
any
other
street
in
london
seen
such
an
endless
procession
of
women
of
the
unfortunate
class
they
were
nearly
all
german
and
their
hard
cruel
faces
should
have
been
a
sufficient
warning
to
anyone
to
give
them
a
wide
berth
i
haven
t
the
slightest
doubt
that
many
of
the
young
men
who
were
foolish
enough
to
be
enticed
by
them
were
ruthlessly
robbed
and
not
infrequently
murdered
one
very
nasty
incident
took
place
just
under
my
window
it
was
in
the
depths
of
december
and
the
snow
lay
thick
on
the
ground
will
anyone
who
experienced
it
ever
forget
that
christmas
of
i
was
laid
up
with
influenza
and
was
lying
awake
coughing
when
i
heard
a
loud
shriek
followed
by
an
oath
and
a
series
of
groans
and
gurgles
then
someone
whistled
and
a
cab
came
up
after
which
all
was
quiet
for
a
few
minutes
when
a
crowd
collected
and
a
babel
of
voices
arose
in
the
morning
my
landlady
with
a
very
white
face
told
me
she
had
seen
it
all
through
her
window
she
slept
in
the
basement
and
had
been
too
horrified
to
move
it
appears
that
shortly
before
midnight
a
man
had
hidden
in
the
doorway
of
the
house
as
if
waiting
for
someone
and
about
ten
minutes
later
a
woman
had
come
along
whom
he
hurled
to
the
ground
and
stabbed
when
the
woman
had
ceased
groaning
the
man
whistled
and
a
cab
came
up
the
driver
getting
down
from
his
seat
helped
lift
the
woman
into
the
vehicle
he
and
the
murderer
then
climbed
into
the
box
there
was
the
crack
of
a
whip
and
the
cab
was
gone
a
few
minutes
afterwards
a
couple
of
policemen
appeared
on
the
scene
talked
for
some
time
and
then
walked
away
after
which
the
street
remained
silent
till
dawn
i
went
out
and
looked
at
the
scene
of
the
incident
there
was
abundant
evidence
on
the
doorstep
and
as
to
what
had
taken
place
and
seeing
the
people
next
door
looking
at
it
i
asked
them
if
they
had
heard
anything
in
the
night
they
shrugged
their
shoulders
it
s
quite
a
common
occurrence
in
this
neighbourhood
they
said
and
it
would
never
do
for
us
to
take
any
notice
of
it
if
we
did
we
should
certainly
sooner
or
later
share
the
same
fate
as
that
thus
no
attempt
was
made
to
bring
the
miscreant
to
justice
and
the
matter
ended
during
the
time
i
was
with
her
my
landlady
was
robbed
twice
on
the
first
occasion
two
boys
came
into
the
front
part
of
the
shop
and
asked
for
some
sandwiches
whilst
the
landlady
s
daughter
who
was
alone
behind
the
counter
was
serving
them
one
of
the
boys
snatched
up
a
ham
the
other
threw
down
a
chair
and
both
flew
out
of
the
shop
the
girl
rushed
after
them
but
of
course
fell
over
the
chair
her
cries
brought
her
brother
bert
and
me
to
the
rescue
and
we
set
off
in
pursuit
of
the
thieves
although
they
had
got
some
distance
bert
being
an
astonishingly
fast
sprinter
had
nearly
caught
them
up
when
the
foremost
of
the
boys
abruptly
halted
and
whirling
round
flung
the
ham
right
at
him
he
ducked
and
the
ham
landed
with
a
splash
in
a
puddle
of
rain
water
picking
it
up
we
bore
it
triumphantly
home
and
it
was
soon
resting
on
the
counter
i
it
was
to
be
sold
as
the
worse
for
its
adventure
episode
number
two
did
not
end
quite
so
happily
a
young
man
with
a
face
and
innocent
big
blue
eyes
came
to
look
for
rooms
he
spoke
with
a
strong
american
accent
and
said
he
was
travelling
for
a
firm
of
jewellers
in
boston
whether
it
was
the
eyes
or
thoughts
of
gold
bracelets
and
pearl
pendants
i
can
not
it
was
both
anyhow
the
landlady
s
daughter
beamed
on
him
and
from
that
day
forth
i
became
a
person
of
second
importance
if
indeed
of
any
importance
at
all
whatever
he
said
was
law
and
whatever
he
chose
to
wear
was
most
then
something
happened
for
which
i
was
not
altogether
unprepared
he
came
down
one
morning
carrying
a
somewhat
bulky
parcel
which
he
told
the
landlady
s
daughter
was
his
dress
suit
it
s
too
small
for
me
he
said
this
bracing
climate
of
yours
has
given
me
such
an
appetite
i
ve
grown
fat
i
m
going
to
take
it
to
the
tailor
down
the
street
to
see
if
he
can
enlarge
it
for
me
by
the
way
can
you
change
me
this
sovereign
he
handed
her
a
coin
and
i
saw
him
smile
tenderly
then
he
went
out
of
the
shop
with
a
pile
of
silver
in
his
never
came
back
the
sovereign
was
of
course
a
bad
one
and
worse
still
the
dress
clothes
were
a
new
suit
of
bert
s
one
for
which
he
must
have
given
at
least
three
pounds
i
was
not
idle
all
the
time
i
stayed
in
york
road
i
was
thrown
on
my
own
resources
and
had
to
find
some
means
of
making
a
livelihood
expensive
though
my
education
had
been
it
was
of
little
practical
use
to
me
now
the
only
subjects
i
knew
anything
about
were
those
required
for
the
sandhurst
and
examinations
and
they
in
no
way
fitted
me
for
business
a
youth
with
a
knowledge
of
and
shorthand
stood
a
much
better
chance
of
obtaining
a
clerkship
than
i
did
it
was
a
bitter
revelation
to
me
i
had
always
been
brought
up
with
the
idea
that
breed
and
manners
were
a
valuable
asset
i
now
discovered
that
without
money
and
influence
they
were
a
handicap
rather
than
otherwise
the
majority
of
employers
i
interviewed
were
certainly
not
gentlemen
nor
apparently
did
they
care
to
have
anything
to
do
with
such
all
they
wanted
was
smartness
in
figures
and
the
capacity
of
standing
prodigiously
long
hours
and
any
amount
of
bullying
i
worked
for
a
week
in
an
office
in
lewisham
my
employer
was
a
kind
of
jobbing
stockbroker
with
a
florid
face
and
yards
of
gold
my
hours
as
far
as
i
can
remember
were
from
nine
to
six
with
twenty
minutes
interval
for
luncheon
the
second
day
i
was
there
i
was
kept
at
work
till
after
seven
and
the
following
day
by
way
of
retaliation
i
took
a
good
hour
over
my
lunch
when
i
got
back
to
the
office
i
thought
my
employer
would
have
died
of
apoplexy
i
have
never
seen
a
man
in
such
a
fury
what
do
you
think
i
pay
you
for
he
shrieked
to
eat
you
haven
t
paid
me
yet
i
responded
it
will
be
time
enough
to
give
way
to
your
emotions
when
you
have
you
kept
me
here
last
night
an
hour
longer
than
the
time
agreed
very
good
you
get
an
hour
less
work
out
of
me
what
s
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
he
raised
his
thick
podgy
hand
and
i
thought
he
was
going
to
strike
me
which
i
hoped
he
would
do
for
i
have
always
been
very
fond
of
boxing
and
a
scrap
with
him
just
then
would
have
been
as
nectar
to
me
to
my
astonishment
however
he
suddenly
subsided
and
walking
out
of
the
room
left
me
to
go
on
with
my
work
undisturbed
i
left
the
office
punctually
at
six
that
evening
and
for
the
few
remaining
days
i
was
with
him
the
prearranged
hours
were
rigidly
adhered
to
that
was
my
one
and
only
experience
in
business
i
tried
to
get
on
the
staff
of
a
newspaper
but
although
i
wrote
to
almost
every
editor
in
london
i
did
not
succeed
i
am
convinced
that
no
post
outside
that
of
a
reporter
for
which
i
had
neither
the
training
nor
the
inclination
can
be
obtained
without
the
investment
of
money
or
colossal
influence
i
managed
however
to
do
some
free
lance
work
and
i
derived
no
little
interest
and
amusement
though
not
much
remuneration
interviewing
for
a
weekly
journal
called
the
first
man
of
any
note
i
met
was
the
late
sir
augustus
harris
to
whom
i
introduced
myself
on
the
stage
of
drury
lane
it
was
during
a
rehearsal
of
the
pantomime
at
which
if
i
remember
rightly
harry
nicholls
herbert
campbell
dan
leno
and
many
other
favourites
of
those
times
were
present
sir
augustus
listened
to
what
i
had
to
say
with
great
courtesy
and
told
me
to
go
to
neil
forsyth
i
did
so
with
the
result
that
i
was
offered
a
small
post
on
the
staff
of
the
theatre
i
was
grateful
to
forsyth
who
was
one
of
the
very
kindest
men
that
ever
breathed
but
apart
from
the
smallness
of
the
salary
there
were
obstacles
in
the
way
and
so
i
had
to
refuse
about
this
time
i
met
a
girl
with
whom
i
became
madly
infatuated
and
when
she
refused
to
marry
me
i
seriously
contemplated
suicide
it
was
this
episode
that
gave
me
the
central
idea
for
my
first
novel
for
satan
s
sake
in
which
i
introduced
the
girl
and
which
is
written
very
much
round
my
own
life
i
am
only
too
thankful
now
that
she
did
not
accept
me
for
i
do
not
know
how
i
should
have
kept
her
and
that
apparently
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
was
the
only
thing
that
mattered
i
fought
a
desperate
battle
with
myself
for
some
time
and
in
the
end
came
to
the
grim
resolution
to
go
on
living
it
was
when
i
was
recovering
from
this
state
of
excessive
mental
dejection
that
i
came
in
contact
with
an
old
acquaintance
a
public
schoolman
at
whose
suggestion
i
decided
to
try
schoolmastering
and
consequently
obtained
a
post
at
daventry
grammar
school
but
i
must
now
return
to
the
principal
subject
of
this
narrative
namely
ghosts
during
the
year
i
was
in
york
road
i
thoroughly
explored
the
east
end
and
in
the
coffee
houses
and
restaurants
of
poplar
deptford
tilbury
and
whitechapel
i
heard
many
accounts
of
hauntings
though
it
is
not
generally
known
the
east
end
of
london
is
far
more
haunted
than
the
west
on
one
of
my
nocturnal
rambles
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
russian
jew
who
had
an
extraordinary
mania
for
spiders
which
he
kept
in
specially
designed
boxes
with
glass
lids
on
their
he
used
to
set
his
children
to
work
collecting
flies
and
other
insects
and
the
whole
family
used
to
revel
in
watching
the
spiders
gorge
themselves
on
their
victims
you
could
see
he
was
innately
cruel
by
the
hard
twinkling
of
his
little
black
eyes
and
the
spasmodic
twitching
of
his
flat
greasy
white
fingers
but
he
was
something
of
a
scholar
and
he
had
a
devout
dread
of
ghosts
there
is
a
haunted
house
close
to
here
he
said
to
me
one
evening
if
you
like
to
come
with
me
i
will
introduce
you
to
the
owner
he
is
a
chinaman
called
king
ho
or
some
such
outlandish
name
and
he
keeps
an
opium
king
ho
did
not
require
much
of
an
introduction
for
as
soon
as
we
entered
he
fixed
his
little
eyes
on
me
and
said
well
what
do
you
want
a
smoke
no
i
said
i
ve
come
to
hear
about
your
ghosts
i
m
interested
in
there
are
plenty
of
them
here
he
murmured
the
house
is
full
of
them
sit
down
i
obeyed
and
the
russian
jew
went
back
to
his
spiders
and
left
me
alone
with
the
chinaman
it
was
a
dirty
sordid
place
reeking
with
a
dozen
different
odours
and
suggestive
of
vermin
and
diseases
of
an
oriental
origin
and
unspeakable
nature
a
curtain
was
drawn
across
one
end
of
the
room
and
noticing
that
my
eyes
wandered
off
in
that
direction
king
ho
got
up
and
pulled
aside
the
drapery
two
wooden
berths
one
above
the
other
were
discovered
the
top
one
was
empty
and
the
lower
occupied
by
a
chinaman
who
was
lying
on
his
side
facing
us
with
absolutely
no
expression
in
his
eyes
or
mouth
he
might
have
been
dead
the
best
part
of
a
week
he
s
away
in
the
rice
fields
of
his
native
home
king
ho
said
talking
to
his
wife
and
playing
with
his
children
he
goes
there
every
night
at
this
time
he
glanced
at
the
big
round
wooden
clock
hanging
on
the
wall
you
mean
he
is
dreaming
i
said
no
i
don
t
king
ho
retorted
i
mean
he
s
spirit
his
intelligence
is
there
that
thing
you
are
looking
at
is
only
his
material
body
he
and
i
and
others
we
know
don
t
set
much
value
on
that
we
can
get
out
of
it
so
easily
it
s
the
immaterial
self
we
then
seeing
i
was
interested
he
resumed
his
chair
and
stretching
out
his
long
thin
yellow
hand
he
touched
me
on
the
arm
listen
he
said
we
chinamen
who
come
from
the
fields
and
mountains
and
grow
up
in
close
touch
with
nature
can
concentrate
from
our
infancy
upwards
we
think
deeply
we
think
of
the
sky
the
stars
the
sun
the
moon
the
mighty
hoang
ho
river
and
the
vast
range
of
the
pelings
we
think
of
them
in
a
sense
quite
different
from
the
sense
in
which
you
londoners
would
think
of
them
you
would
regard
them
as
so
many
objects
and
we
think
of
them
as
spirits
that
can
act
as
magnets
to
our
intelligences
akin
to
ourselves
that
can
when
once
we
become
thoroughly
acquainted
with
them
draw
us
to
them
the
pelings
live
just
as
much
as
you
and
i
might
pull
down
their
body
that
great
elevated
frame
you
style
the
mountains
just
as
you
might
overturn
that
bench
but
the
real
the
spiritual
pelings
would
still
remain
when
once
you
grasp
the
idea
that
all
nature
everything
even
to
the
chairs
and
tables
have
immaterial
representatives
then
you
will
begin
to
understand
the
principle
of
the
concentration
we
practise
you
must
see
the
pelings
the
the
rice
fields
not
as
they
would
appear
to
the
man
in
the
street
here
here
in
london
piccadilly
but
as
we
who
live
near
them
and
know
them
see
figures
that
can
see
and
hear
figures
with
intelligence
expression
in
their
eyes
when
you
see
them
like
that
you
will
get
to
love
them
and
when
you
love
them
you
will
unconsciously
concentrate
on
them
as
you
do
on
all
things
that
you
love
your
love
will
not
be
in
vain
it
will
be
reciprocated
and
the
love
that
reciprocates
yours
will
as
a
magnet
draw
immaterial
true
it
now
you
begin
to
understand
i
can
tell
by
your
face
the
chinaman
of
the
plains
and
myself
knows
nature
and
when
he
leaves
china
and
comes
over
here
he
concentrates
until
he
hears
the
voice
of
that
nature
calling
to
him
and
when
he
hears
it
his
spirit
is
gently
freed
from
his
material
body
and
borne
silently
and
instantaneously
to
his
home
now
he
can
think
best
when
he
can
get
some
at
least
of
the
conditions
of
his
native
the
most
important
of
them
is
silence
not
silence
such
as
you
may
understand
it
but
the
silence
of
the
conscious
inanimate
hills
and
rivers
and
the
only
way
to
procure
it
is
through
opium
i
supply
hence
he
comes
here
takes
it
and
lies
over
yonder
and
thinks
till
he
hears
the
call
and
his
spirit
is
but
the
ghosts
i
interrupted
the
ghosts
you
spoke
wait
he
said
listen
sometimes
men
have
come
here
who
have
lost
the
love
of
the
spirit
of
the
mountain
and
river
they
have
lost
it
because
they
have
liked
too
much
this
london
of
yours
and
have
imbibed
too
deeply
of
that
detestable
immorality
which
so
weakens
the
spirit
that
it
can
not
even
if
it
heard
the
call
get
away
from
the
flesh
i
tell
those
men
that
my
opium
will
do
them
no
good
but
they
take
it
they
take
it
and
dream
as
englishmen
would
their
spirits
chained
to
their
material
bodies
when
these
depraved
chinamen
awake
and
realise
that
they
can
never
never
again
be
drawn
by
the
mighty
majestic
love
of
the
spirit
of
the
mountain
and
river
and
that
they
can
never
again
revisit
the
home
of
their
childhood
so
bitter
is
their
disappointment
that
they
kill
always
here
but
their
lodgings
in
the
river
or
in
the
docks
their
spirits
then
invariably
come
here
where
undoubtedly
they
renew
their
vain
efforts
to
get
back
to
the
mighty
majestic
spirit
of
the
mountain
and
river
whose
love
they
have
lost
look
in
that
top
berth
and
tell
me
what
you
see
there
it
s
empty
i
said
look
again
he
replied
i
did
so
but
still
there
was
nothing
there
only
just
the
bare
dingy
panelling
well
he
asked
what
now
nothing
i
said
absolutely
go
up
to
it
and
put
one
hand
inside
he
remarked
i
did
so
and
sprang
back
with
a
loud
cry
i
had
touched
a
face
yes
he
said
as
i
stepped
out
into
the
of
the
causeway
it
frightens
some
people
but
it
never
frightens
me
because
i
know
that
the
only
consolation
possible
for
these
unhappy
spirits
is
to
lie
next
to
or
to
come
in
contact
with
the
bodies
of
those
whose
spirits
are
walking
and
talking
with
their
fond
ones
in
distant
whilst
i
was
at
york
road
i
became
acquainted
with
an
irish
doctor
whom
i
will
call
flynn
he
ran
a
surgery
not
far
from
king
ho
s
house
flynn
belonged
to
a
famous
secret
society
whose
fundamental
object
was
to
carry
on
a
doctrine
of
surreptitious
hatred
to
england
and
all
things
english
though
i
had
no
sympathy
with
such
a
i
have
always
held
the
opinion
that
however
badly
england
behaved
to
ireland
in
the
past
the
majority
of
the
english
people
of
are
only
too
anxious
to
act
fairly
to
her
and
therefore
it
is
better
to
let
bygones
be
found
flynn
a
very
original
and
entertaining
character
all
his
patients
were
either
irish
or
of
foreign
extraction
and
whenever
any
english
person
came
to
the
surgery
he
flatly
refused
to
attend
them
one
evening
when
i
was
sitting
chatting
with
him
in
front
of
a
blazing
peat
would
never
burn
english
swedish
engineers
came
into
the
surgery
and
flynn
who
for
some
peculiar
reason
was
particularly
partial
to
the
swedes
asked
them
to
join
us
at
supper
the
meal
certainly
was
not
in
the
approved
style
of
the
west
end
nor
perhaps
would
it
have
appealed
to
the
nouveau
riche
for
there
was
no
snowy
tablecloth
no
serviettes
no
champagne
no
liqueurs
it
consisted
of
boiled
beef
suet
dumplings
in
their
skins
of
plenty
yes
plenty
of
stout
and
whiskey
and
it
was
very
welcome
to
the
four
hungry
healthy
men
who
did
ample
justice
to
it
after
we
had
finished
and
pipes
were
produced
i
brought
up
the
subject
of
very
far
from
my
one
of
the
swedes
laughed
ghosts
he
said
there
are
no
such
things
neither
ghosts
nor
fairies
i
believe
in
nothing
there
is
no
god
no
devil
no
heaven
no
hell
when
we
die
we
is
no
future
life
let
s
have
a
s√©ance
flynn
said
and
see
if
we
can
t
convince
him
i
have
the
skeleton
of
a
murderer
in
the
room
overhead
i
will
fetch
it
down
and
it
shall
sit
round
the
table
with
all
right
the
sceptical
swede
whose
name
was
nielssen
said
fetch
it
down
fetch
twenty
skeletons
you
like
the
more
the
merrier
nothing
will
convince
flynn
ran
upstairs
and
presently
reappeared
with
a
tall
skeleton
in
his
arms
the
table
was
cleared
and
we
all
sat
round
it
with
our
hands
spread
out
after
the
usual
manner
of
table
turners
the
skeleton
being
placed
between
the
two
swedes
each
of
whom
had
hold
of
one
of
its
hands
flynn
then
turned
down
the
lights
and
we
started
asking
the
table
questions
many
of
which
i
fear
were
of
a
very
ribald
and
frivolous
nature
every
now
and
then
it
gave
a
big
tilt
and
nielssen
shouted
that
s
for
me
it
s
my
s
found
out
i
ve
been
making
love
to
my
landlady
s
once
there
was
a
rap
and
for
the
moment
i
was
taken
in
then
the
other
swede
heilborn
cried
out
it
s
only
nielssen
he
did
it
with
his
foot
he
s
incorrigible
this
sort
of
thing
went
on
for
some
time
flynn
and
nielssen
constantly
playing
some
prank
and
heilborn
and
myself
not
always
too
serious
suddenly
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
seemed
to
undergo
a
change
and
as
if
by
common
consent
we
were
all
silent
then
nielssen
uttered
a
sharp
cry
of
pain
strike
a
light
quickly
he
cried
my
hand
is
being
hurt
frightfully
we
did
so
and
nielssen
gave
vent
to
an
expression
of
relief
how
did
it
happen
heilborn
asked
i
don
t
know
nielssen
said
faintly
he
was
evidently
much
shaken
and
spoke
with
the
emotion
of
a
man
who
has
undergone
some
violent
shock
i
was
only
holding
the
skeleton
the
same
as
you
when
i
suddenly
felt
its
fingers
close
like
a
vice
on
mine
it
was
a
grip
of
iron
see
my
hand
is
crushed
almost
out
of
shape
he
held
it
out
and
we
all
bent
over
it
curiously
compared
with
the
other
hand
it
looked
singularly
white
and
limp
and
when
flynn
touched
it
nielssen
very
perceptibly
winced
flynn
gave
him
some
brandy
and
after
a
little
while
he
seemed
himself
again
but
he
would
not
continue
the
s√©ance
there
s
something
very
odd
about
the
skeleton
he
said
i
don
t
believe
in
spirits
as
you
know
but
there
must
be
something
closely
akin
to
one
attached
to
this
thing
and
he
gave
it
a
vicious
kick
with
his
foot
a
week
later
when
i
called
at
flynn
s
house
he
told
me
that
nielssen
was
in
bed
he
had
fallen
downstairs
and
badly
bruised
his
spine
besides
breaking
a
leg
he
ll
get
over
it
all
right
flynn
said
but
it
will
be
some
time
before
he
can
do
anything
his
account
of
the
accident
is
most
remarkable
in
fact
he
declares
that
it
wasn
t
an
accident
that
he
was
deliberately
thrown
he
swears
that
he
distinctly
saw
a
skeleton
hand
suddenly
catch
hold
of
him
round
the
ankle
and
that
the
next
moment
he
felt
himself
whirling
through
the
air
he
is
most
emphatic
in
his
declaration
that
he
will
never
again
scoff
at
ghosts
or
play
with
the
invisible
and
now
flynn
added
the
wretched
thing
has
begun
to
plague
me
i
can
t
get
a
decent
night
s
sleep
as
soon
as
i
begin
to
doze
i
am
visited
by
the
most
disturbing
dreams
i
invariably
hear
knocking
at
the
door
and
when
i
open
it
something
rushes
in
and
strangles
me
but
the
worst
of
it
is
i
hear
the
knocking
when
i
m
awake
too
sometimes
it
begins
directly
i
get
into
bed
before
my
head
has
touched
the
pillow
knock
knock
knock
hard
sharp
knock
of
bony
knuckles
on
door
walls
and
furniture
i
am
not
actually
frightened
but
i
don
t
like
it
what
do
you
make
of
it
if
it
s
not
the
skeleton
the
spirit
of
some
depraved
human
i
replied
it
s
some
other
equally
low
and
vicious
one
of
the
class
that
visit
s√©ances
and
attach
themselves
to
the
unlucky
sitter
you
might
try
getting
rid
of
the
it
cremated
and
see
what
effect
that
flynn
took
my
advice
the
skeleton
was
reduced
to
ashes
and
the
ashes
buried
many
miles
away
from
limehouse
causeway
after
which
the
disturbances
as
far
as
flynn
was
concerned
at
any
rate
entirely
ceased
whether
nielssen
was
victimised
again
i
can
not
say
he
rejoined
his
ship
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
and
since
then
he
has
completely
passed
out
of
my
existence
there
was
a
house
i
used
occasionally
to
go
to
in
whitechapel
a
rendezvous
of
itinerant
free
lance
writers
like
myself
where
although
i
never
actually
saw
any
ghostly
phenomena
i
always
had
very
extraordinary
impressions
the
moment
i
crossed
the
threshold
i
fancied
i
was
in
a
big
funeral
procession
following
a
hearse
it
was
a
dull
winter
s
day
i
thought
there
were
inches
of
slush
on
the
ground
and
the
cold
was
intense
i
could
not
see
the
faces
of
the
people
walking
beside
me
but
i
instinctively
knew
that
they
wore
an
expression
of
extreme
relief
and
that
some
even
of
them
mourners
laughed
we
tramped
on
till
we
came
to
a
steep
hill
then
there
was
a
loud
report
and
at
once
everything
became
chaotic
after
this
my
mind
gradually
cleared
and
the
impressions
abruptly
ceased
there
was
no
variation
in
these
impressions
they
always
began
and
ended
in
precisely
the
same
way
moreover
i
invariably
received
them
whenever
i
entered
the
house
i
mentioned
my
experience
one
day
to
an
habitu√©
of
the
place
and
he
quite
casually
informed
me
that
several
men
who
went
there
had
had
similar
experiences
and
he
thought
the
landlord
if
approached
tactfully
might
offer
some
sort
of
explanation
acting
upon
this
suggestion
i
spoke
to
the
landlord
and
learned
from
him
that
half
a
century
or
more
ago
the
house
was
owned
by
a
wealthy
tradesman
who
it
was
generally
supposed
had
made
his
money
by
sweating
his
employ√©s
when
he
died
all
the
hands
had
to
attend
his
funeral
but
far
from
looking
sad
as
they
followed
the
coffin
they
had
exhibited
every
manifestation
of
joy
just
as
the
procession
had
reached
the
summit
of
a
steep
hill
a
man
fired
a
gun
from
a
cottage
window
and
the
horses
drawing
the
hearse
taking
fright
dashed
down
the
incline
and
into
a
wall
at
the
foot
of
it
strange
to
say
no
one
was
injured
but
the
coffin
was
thrown
out
and
broken
to
pieces
the
event
made
a
great
impression
upon
the
minds
of
all
who
witnessed
it
and
the
landlord
informed
me
that
i
was
by
no
means
the
only
person
who
upon
entering
the
house
had
received
a
vivid
mental
picture
of
the
scene
i
am
often
asked
if
i
am
a
consistent
medium
no
i
am
not
it
is
only
at
times
i
see
ghosts
only
at
times
i
receive
vivid
impressions
and
i
do
not
believe
that
any
person
however
mediumistic
can
depend
upon
his
or
her
psychic
faculty
for
consistency
i
have
been
to
several
public
s√©ances
where
professional
mediums
have
had
the
audacity
to
say
they
see
spirits
standing
beside
practically
everyone
in
the
assembly
they
rattle
off
the
description
of
an
alleged
spirit
as
if
it
were
a
part
in
a
play
it
undoubtedly
is
to
anyone
who
pauses
to
reflect
genuine
phantasms
do
not
come
to
order
quite
so
readily
in
olden
times
when
people
were
really
psychic
those
versed
in
the
art
from
their
childhood
upwards
could
only
raise
a
ghost
with
great
difficulty
and
often
only
by
resorting
to
spells
many
of
which
were
of
a
very
subtle
and
complex
nature
and
when
in
the
end
they
did
succeed
such
manifestations
invariably
had
a
very
alarming
effect
on
the
medium
as
well
as
the
spectator
how
is
it
then
that
so
many
of
the
professional
mediums
of
can
not
only
see
visitants
from
the
other
world
whenever
they
like
all
around
them
but
can
view
these
ghostly
visitants
without
being
in
the
least
disconcerted
the
saying
a
hair
have
they
really
stronger
nerves
than
had
saul
and
a
closer
far
closer
intimacy
with
the
unknown
than
had
the
witch
of
endor
or
can
it
be
that
the
spirit
world
has
so
participated
in
our
age
of
rapid
forms
of
a
medium
has
only
to
raise
his
or
her
eyebrows
and
a
host
of
spirits
at
once
whiz
into
the
room
i
do
not
think
so
i
believe
that
such
mediums
whose
psychic
vision
is
apparently
inexhaustible
and
can
be
turned
on
and
off
to
either
unmitigated
humbugs
or
hysterical
dupes
who
mistake
the
baldest
impressions
for
actual
spiritual
phenomena
the
unmitigated
humbug
has
only
to
describe
the
alleged
presence
with
a
little
elasticity
and
the
description
will
surely
somewhat
or
another
of
our
departed
friends
who
amongst
us
does
not
know
someone
on
the
other
side
passably
rather
tall
of
medium
colouring
and
somewhat
stout
and
if
we
plead
that
we
do
not
it
is
of
no
medium
glibly
asserts
that
the
spirit
he
or
she
describes
has
got
behind
our
chair
by
mistake
and
is
really
searching
for
someone
else
but
apart
from
this
obvious
fraud
can
we
believe
that
any
one
of
those
whom
we
have
loved
and
lost
would
so
degrade
themselves
and
us
as
to
appear
at
a
public
s√©ance
before
a
company
of
strangers
surely
we
would
rather
not
see
them
at
all
than
see
them
in
such
circumstances
at
any
rate
we
would
our
souls
in
patience
until
our
departed
loved
ones
can
appear
to
us
in
they
sometimes
the
intervention
of
any
medium
whatsoever
with
regard
to
automatic
or
spirit
writing
there
is
i
believe
just
as
much
fraud
practised
the
mere
fact
that
sir
somebody
or
other
has
a
touching
belief
in
one
or
two
of
these
automatic
scribes
is
quite
enough
for
most
people
and
consequently
they
never
dream
of
questioning
the
integrity
of
any
medium
who
professes
to
convey
to
them
messages
from
the
dead
it
is
sufficient
that
the
man
with
the
title
the
great
man
of
science
believes
but
they
forget
often
wilfully
forget
that
the
cleverest
man
is
often
the
most
simple
that
a
great
judge
has
not
unfrequently
had
his
pockets
picked
and
that
eminence
in
one
direction
by
no
means
denotes
ability
in
another
snobbishness
is
responsible
for
much
the
big
man
is
credulous
and
because
he
is
credulous
the
little
man
is
credulous
too
hence
consistency
in
the
spirit
world
in
clairvoyance
in
automatic
writing
is
for
the
moment
almost
universally
accepted
and
direct
communication
with
the
spirit
world
erroneously
looked
upon
as
an
occurrence
it
will
be
otherwise
when
the
man
in
the
street
wakes
up
and
discovers
the
occult
for
himself
experience
will
i
think
teach
him
as
it
has
taught
me
that
although
ghosts
may
on
very
rare
occasions
come
to
when
they
do
their
coming
is
i
believe
quite
as
surprising
to
the
medium
as
it
is
to
the
far
the
greater
number
of
superphysical
phenomena
appear
spontaneously
and
it
is
through
such
spontaneous
appearances
only
that
we
can
hope
to
make
any
progress
in
our
communication
with
the
other
world
chapter
ix
night
ramblings
on
wimbledon
common
and
hounslow
heath
if
there
are
any
places
in
london
that
should
be
more
haunted
than
others
assuredly
those
places
are
the
parks
and
commons
when
i
was
living
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
i
spent
many
nights
tramping
about
wimbledon
clapham
wandsworth
tooting
and
streatham
commons
since
then
i
have
lived
at
blackheath
hampstead
hounslow
and
dulwich
so
that
i
may
say
i
know
pretty
nearly
every
inch
of
these
places
i
can
see
myself
now
standing
on
wimbledon
common
close
to
a
pool
in
the
dead
of
night
no
one
about
and
the
reflection
of
the
moon
staring
at
me
from
the
unruffled
surface
of
the
water
i
am
trying
to
get
impressions
of
any
event
that
may
have
taken
place
there
i
got
none
suddenly
a
hand
falls
on
my
shoulder
i
swing
round
and
peering
into
my
face
is
the
white
haggard
face
of
a
tramp
you
ain
t
going
to
drown
yourself
are
you
he
said
why
i
asked
anticipating
a
severe
rebuke
from
this
withered
and
worn
scarecrow
of
humanity
why
he
said
because
don
t
do
it
here
i
can
show
you
a
much
better
spot
where
the
water
is
deep
and
where
when
once
you
get
in
you
can
t
very
easily
get
but
how
will
that
benefit
you
i
enquired
wondering
why
he
was
so
eager
you
can
let
me
have
your
clothes
can
t
you
he
explained
you
won
t
want
to
take
them
with
you
into
the
next
world
from
what
i
hears
about
it
sperrits
don
t
need
neither
coats
nor
trousers
and
the
few
shillings
i
shall
get
for
them
will
do
me
a
bit
of
good
and
won
t
hurt
but
i
wasn
t
contemplating
suicide
i
remarked
i
m
not
tired
of
life
ain
t
you
he
said
in
extremely
disappointed
tones
then
why
are
you
out
here
at
this
time
of
night
if
it
comes
to
that
i
observed
why
are
you
i
ain
t
got
nowhere
else
to
go
he
said
and
there
are
no
police
out
here
to
disturb
nor
ghosts
i
remarked
ghosts
he
chuckled
i
m
not
afraid
of
ghosts
i
shall
soon
be
one
myself
i
expect
but
there
is
one
spot
here
i
don
t
go
near
after
why
why
he
said
come
along
with
me
and
maybe
you
ll
had
he
been
anything
like
my
size
i
should
not
have
gone
for
his
appearance
was
very
far
from
assuring
but
as
he
was
a
small
man
i
felt
comparatively
safe
we
walked
side
by
side
over
the
grass
crossed
a
gleaming
white
path
and
steering
in
a
slightly
northerly
could
tell
that
much
by
the
halted
in
front
of
a
shallow
pit
on
the
other
side
of
which
was
a
big
bush
it
s
there
he
said
pointing
at
the
pit
i
ve
tried
to
sleep
there
twice
and
each
time
i
ve
been
woken
up
by
hearing
something
heavy
fall
close
to
my
head
it
seems
to
come
from
the
bush
it
s
the
bush
that
skeers
me
he
added
and
though
i
don
t
mind
passing
it
in
the
nothing
on
earth
will
persuade
me
to
look
behind
it
after
not
even
sixpence
i
said
fingering
that
coin
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
go
on
he
said
you
haven
t
sixpence
otherwise
you
d
not
be
here
you
re
joking
if
anyone
really
did
offer
me
sixpence
now
to
do
it
well
i
don
t
say
but
what
i
mightn
t
he
spoke
so
hungrily
and
looked
so
famished
that
i
decided
to
part
with
it
though
sixpence
to
me
just
then
had
a
particularly
real
value
i
showed
it
him
look
behind
that
tree
i
said
and
i
ll
give
it
he
set
off
at
once
no
i
called
out
that
won
t
do
you
must
go
through
the
he
proceeded
to
obey
and
was
in
the
middle
of
the
hollow
when
i
distinctly
heard
something
very
heavy
strike
the
ground
apparently
close
to
him
i
ran
round
the
bush
just
in
time
to
see
what
i
thought
was
a
black
shadow
shoot
across
the
ground
and
disappear
in
a
neighbouring
cluster
of
trees
when
i
returned
the
tramp
was
still
in
the
pit
but
i
could
see
nothing
there
to
account
for
the
noise
well
he
said
did
you
hear
it
i
heard
something
i
replied
and
there
s
your
i
often
went
to
wimbledon
common
afterwards
but
never
again
saw
the
tramp
nor
found
the
hollow
my
blackheath
and
greenwich
park
experiences
or
at
least
most
of
them
are
narrated
fully
in
my
haunted
houses
of
london
so
that
i
can
only
refer
briefly
to
them
here
from
the
impressions
i
got
when
walking
on
the
common
at
blackheath
i
shall
always
believe
that
the
superphysical
influences
there
are
particularly
demoralising
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
the
way
a
curiously
appropriate
be
the
rendezvous
of
the
very
worst
type
of
phantasms
of
the
dead
and
of
the
most
vicious
neutrarians
after
leaving
london
and
entering
on
my
scholastic
career
i
was
first
of
all
a
master
at
daventry
then
tutor
in
an
irish
family
at
aldershot
and
then
in
succession
a
master
in
preparatory
schools
at
wandsworth
hereford
and
blackheath
of
these
various
posts
i
liked
that
at
blackheath
the
least
partly
because
the
headmaster
there
was
the
most
unmitigated
snob
and
my
pupils
hopelessly
spoilt
and
partly
because
i
had
such
a
detestation
of
the
heath
after
dark
my
only
consolation
in
those
days
was
cricket
and
writing
every
evening
after
my
work
with
the
boys
was
done
i
repaired
to
a
room
over
a
library
in
blackheath
village
and
it
was
there
that
i
completed
my
first
novel
for
satan
s
the
book
deals
with
the
soul
of
a
suicide
and
was
based
as
i
have
already
stated
on
my
experiences
in
america
and
york
road
lambeth
i
tried
it
with
various
publishers
but
without
success
and
it
was
not
until
six
years
later
when
i
was
living
in
a
small
fishing
town
in
cornwall
that
i
eventually
got
it
taken
it
so
happened
that
a
novelist
came
to
see
me
one
day
and
when
i
told
him
that
i
had
attempted
a
book
he
said
he
would
like
to
see
it
i
fished
it
out
of
the
box
where
it
had
lain
undisturbed
for
years
and
he
went
off
with
it
subsequently
showing
it
to
a
reader
of
a
publishing
a
was
staying
in
the
town
at
the
time
and
who
was
so
impressed
with
it
that
he
advised
his
firm
to
accept
it
it
did
not
even
then
come
out
for
over
a
year
and
the
anxiety
of
awaiting
my
d√©but
as
an
author
can
better
be
imagined
than
described
the
success
i
prayed
for
was
not
showered
upon
me
but
the
book
was
well
received
on
the
whole
and
paved
the
way
for
other
works
to
follow
and
now
let
me
hie
back
to
london
and
its
commons
though
hampstead
has
in
all
probability
its
share
of
phantasms
my
impressions
there
have
been
of
a
more
agreeable
nature
than
at
blackheath
i
spent
the
greater
part
of
several
consecutive
nights
one
summer
sitting
on
a
bench
in
a
very
rustic
glade
on
the
heath
waiting
for
anything
that
might
happen
once
or
twice
between
one
and
two
something
seemed
to
be
making
a
violent
effort
to
materialise
and
i
fully
expected
to
see
a
figure
suddenly
appear
before
me
my
impressions
were
that
it
would
be
the
figure
of
a
woman
and
that
she
would
be
carrying
a
white
bundle
in
her
arms
i
felt
that
she
was
in
great
trouble
and
wanted
to
ask
me
for
advice
i
associated
her
worries
with
a
big
house
that
used
to
stand
somewhere
near
the
summit
of
hampstead
hill
i
felt
all
this
very
acutely
and
i
used
to
repeat
aloud
my
willingness
to
do
anything
i
could
to
assist
her
strange
to
say
a
few
years
later
i
met
a
lady
who
told
me
that
she
had
had
a
curious
experience
in
the
same
spot
she
was
walking
through
it
rather
late
one
autumn
evening
accompanied
by
her
dog
a
big
black
retriever
when
she
came
to
the
seat
where
i
used
to
sit
the
dog
started
barking
and
showed
signs
of
great
terror
somewhat
alarmed
she
was
about
to
hurry
on
when
a
voice
close
to
her
said
it
s
only
me
winifred
don
t
be
frightened
the
boat
i
sailed
in
to
america
was
wrecked
and
only
the
child
was
the
lady
looked
round
but
there
was
no
one
in
sight
on
reaching
home
she
mentioned
the
incident
to
her
mother
who
exclaimed
in
astonishment
well
that
is
odd
i
was
sitting
on
a
seat
i
should
think
in
that
very
spot
about
forty
years
were
living
in
house
on
haverstock
hill
at
the
a
letter
was
brought
me
announcing
the
loss
of
a
big
sailing
vessel
in
the
atlantic
on
which
my
maid
winnie
as
we
used
to
call
her
had
sailed
with
her
husband
to
america
only
a
very
few
of
the
passengers
and
crew
survived
and
winnie
and
her
husband
were
both
drowned
but
i
never
knew
they
had
a
hounslow
heath
should
teem
with
ghosts
for
it
once
swarmed
with
who
after
committing
every
conceivable
act
of
violence
on
and
around
the
heath
usually
ended
their
career
there
on
gibbets
i
once
had
rooms
near
the
bath
road
and
spent
many
nights
rambling
about
the
heath
in
quest
of
ghostly
adventure
one
evening
i
kept
fancying
i
was
followed
everywhere
by
a
tall
muffled
figure
and
when
in
alarm
i
hastened
over
the
grass
on
to
the
roadway
i
heard
a
low
cynical
laugh
all
the
way
home
the
steps
seemed
to
pursue
me
and
when
i
got
into
bed
and
prepared
to
blow
out
the
light
i
saw
the
curtains
by
the
window
rustle
and
swell
out
as
if
someone
was
behind
them
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
ventured
to
blow
out
the
light
and
when
i
slept
i
dreamed
a
dark
hooded
figure
was
bending
over
me
on
another
occasion
as
i
perambulated
the
heath
where
the
trees
were
thickly
clustered
and
the
undergrowth
had
become
the
densest
tangle
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
two
men
playing
dice
i
heard
their
laughter
and
the
rattling
of
the
box
as
they
shook
it
in
the
air
and
threw
out
the
dice
then
suddenly
their
gaiety
was
turned
to
were
oaths
and
blows
cries
and
groans
and
all
became
silent
save
for
the
soughing
and
moaning
of
the
wind
through
the
lofty
but
as
i
came
away
from
the
heath
there
was
again
that
cynical
laugh
and
again
footsteps
seemed
to
follow
me
home
and
again
the
curtain
by
the
window
of
my
room
shook
and
swelled
i
did
not
go
to
the
heath
one
night
i
lay
awake
in
bed
instead
and
about
the
hour
i
had
usually
returned
i
heard
steps
long
swinging
steps
coming
down
the
little
side
road
towards
the
house
my
memory
at
once
went
back
to
that
night
in
dublin
and
i
strained
my
ears
to
catch
the
accompanying
sound
i
had
not
long
to
soon
came
the
same
old
familiar
click
click
click
in
an
agony
of
fear
lest
the
steps
should
stop
at
the
house
and
there
should
be
a
repetition
of
the
terrible
knocking
at
the
door
i
lighted
a
candle
and
sat
up
nearer
and
nearer
they
came
and
then
when
i
felt
certain
they
would
stop
to
my
infinite
relief
they
went
on
on
past
the
house
the
echoes
ringing
out
loud
and
clear
in
the
keen
frosty
air
until
they
reached
the
bath
road
i
fully
expected
some
misfortune
would
happen
to
me
after
this
occurrence
as
the
last
time
i
had
heard
the
steps
had
been
at
the
time
of
my
failure
to
pass
the
medical
for
the
and
shortly
before
my
disastrous
trip
to
america
yet
nothing
of
a
specially
untoward
nature
happened
apparently
the
steps
on
this
occasion
merely
heralded
another
change
in
my
vocation
for
i
shortly
afterwards
became
imbued
with
the
desire
to
be
an
actor
and
commenced
what
was
destined
to
be
a
lively
though
very
brief
theatrical
career
as
a
pupil
in
the
henry
neville
studio
oxford
street
before
however
passing
on
to
subsequent
events
i
must
relate
one
only
happening
i
experienced
at
hounslow
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
heath
there
was
one
spot
that
had
a
peculiar
fascination
for
me
and
whenever
i
returned
from
it
i
dreamed
the
same
a
beautiful
girl
in
an
costume
with
fair
hair
large
blue
eyes
and
lips
approached
my
bed
and
leaned
over
me
she
had
the
most
appealing
expression
in
her
face
and
seemed
to
be
anxious
to
make
me
her
confidant
i
was
always
about
to
address
her
when
some
extraordinary
metamorphosis
took
place
and
i
awoke
palpitating
with
terror
the
dream
greatly
impressed
me
and
i
tried
my
best
to
discover
a
reason
for
it
i
did
eventually
but
not
until
the
year
i
published
some
haunted
houses
of
england
and
wales
when
i
got
into
correspondence
with
a
very
old
lady
whom
i
will
call
miss
carmichael
miss
carmichael
lived
at
ealing
close
to
the
parish
church
and
wrote
to
me
to
the
effect
that
if
i
liked
to
call
on
her
she
could
tell
me
a
curious
tale
about
an
old
house
that
used
to
stand
on
the
outskirts
of
hounslow
heath
of
course
i
accepted
this
invitation
i
found
miss
carmichael
when
i
called
lying
on
a
sofa
crippled
with
rheumatism
but
otherwise
in
the
full
possession
of
all
her
senses
and
wonderfully
vivacious
despite
the
fact
that
she
was
well
over
ninety
the
house
i
want
to
tell
you
about
she
said
was
called
the
it
was
a
large
manor
house
with
very
extensive
grounds
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
it
belonged
to
my
aged
relative
miss
denning
she
never
lived
in
it
herself
but
she
kept
it
in
excellent
repair
and
at
her
death
in
or
about
her
nephew
inherited
an
apparently
valuable
property
now
tom
denning
had
a
great
friend
dick
mayhew
and
it
was
from
dick
mayhew
who
was
also
a
great
friend
of
mine
that
i
heard
the
most
detailed
account
of
the
hauntings
i
will
try
and
tell
you
the
story
just
as
my
friend
told
it
to
i
have
reproduced
the
gist
of
this
narrative
in
my
own
language
i
was
sitting
in
my
stuffy
office
in
jermyn
street
one
spring
morning
when
who
should
suddenly
walk
in
but
tom
denning
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
some
time
why
dick
he
said
how
fagged
and
run
down
you
look
a
spell
in
the
country
is
what
you
need
it
would
do
you
all
the
good
in
the
world
supposing
you
come
down
to
my
place
at
hounslow
and
have
a
blow
on
the
heath
i
keep
a
couple
of
horses
and
you
can
ride
all
day
if
you
what
surprises
you
spring
on
one
i
ejaculated
i
didn
t
know
you
were
living
so
near
at
hounslow
too
aren
t
you
afraid
of
highwaymen
i
hear
they
still
visit
the
place
occasionally
how
long
have
you
been
there
i
haven
t
been
there
yet
dick
replied
with
a
laugh
at
least
not
to
stay
the
property
has
just
been
left
me
by
my
aunt
it
s
a
queer
old
house
just
the
kind
of
place
a
romantic
beggar
like
you
would
like
and
if
any
house
ought
to
be
haunted
it
ought
they
say
a
murder
was
once
committed
there
by
an
ancestress
of
mine
a
girl
whose
face
was
as
beautiful
as
she
herself
was
evil
and
that
her
spirit
still
roams
the
house
and
i
should
certainly
like
to
see
her
i
said
and
so
i
am
sure
would
greg
was
dick
s
bloodhound
well
i
ll
give
you
both
an
opportunity
tom
laughed
take
greg
with
you
and
a
friend
too
if
you
like
for
i
may
not
be
able
to
join
you
at
i
accepted
and
in
due
course
arrived
at
the
gables
accompanied
by
my
cousin
ralph
who
was
then
a
lieutenant
in
the
buffs
and
greg
the
grounds
surrounding
the
gables
which
stood
near
the
edge
of
the
heath
were
encompassed
by
a
very
high
wall
and
consisted
of
a
broad
lawn
in
front
a
small
spinney
on
one
side
an
extensive
shrubbery
on
the
other
and
big
kitchen
gardens
at
the
back
the
house
itself
seventeenth
century
and
covered
with
ivy
from
tip
to
toe
was
picturesque
in
the
extreme
there
were
no
servants
only
the
caretakers
a
man
and
his
wife
who
occupied
rooms
in
the
east
wing
the
west
wing
was
reserved
for
us
after
dinner
in
a
hall
so
enormous
that
it
made
us
feel
positively
lilliputian
we
wandered
out
into
the
garden
it
was
a
glorious
night
the
sky
one
mass
of
silver
scintillating
stars
the
air
redolent
with
the
odour
of
spring
flowers
by
jove
ralph
remarked
to
me
as
we
strolled
across
the
lawn
by
jove
no
one
would
think
we
were
so
close
to
that
heath
why
it
was
only
a
few
years
ago
that
a
fellow
in
my
regiment
was
set
on
there
and
after
being
robbed
of
all
he
had
on
him
half
beaten
to
death
with
bludgeons
it
s
one
of
the
worst
spots
round
then
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
jogged
my
elbow
coming
towards
us
from
the
house
was
the
figure
of
a
young
girl
she
wore
a
white
dress
with
a
dark
cloak
flung
loosely
over
her
shoulders
and
the
moonlight
playing
over
her
face
revealed
a
countenance
of
extraordinary
delicacy
and
beauty
her
eyes
were
large
and
childlike
in
their
expression
her
lips
daintily
modelled
her
teeth
wonderfully
white
and
even
her
hair
golden
whether
it
was
the
effect
of
the
moonlight
on
them
or
not
i
can
not
say
but
her
cheeks
were
absolutely
devoid
of
colour
almost
strikingly
pale
whilst
i
fancied
i
detected
in
the
slightly
open
mouth
an
expression
of
pain
i
saw
every
detail
most
distinctly
even
to
the
shape
of
her
fingers
which
were
very
pointed
she
came
on
without
apparently
noticing
us
and
we
watched
her
trip
past
us
and
disappear
in
the
spinney
what
a
stunner
ralph
exclaimed
i
don
t
know
when
i
ve
seen
a
prettier
face
sly
fellow
denning
i
wonder
who
she
can
be
he
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
we
heard
the
most
awful
scream
a
shriek
of
terror
and
despair
such
as
sent
all
the
blood
in
my
body
to
my
heart
and
left
the
rest
of
me
like
ice
my
god
what
s
happened
to
her
ralph
gasped
she
s
being
murdered
quick
we
dashed
into
the
spinney
but
despite
the
fact
that
we
searched
everywhere
no
girl
was
to
be
found
returning
to
the
house
we
made
enquiries
of
the
caretakers
who
were
vehement
in
their
denial
of
knowing
the
girl
or
of
having
heard
her
cries
much
puzzled
we
then
retired
to
our
night
quarters
the
room
that
had
been
assigned
to
us
for
we
preferred
to
share
one
between
us
was
situated
about
midway
down
a
long
narrow
corridor
lighted
at
the
further
end
by
a
casement
window
across
which
sprays
of
ivy
blew
to
and
fro
in
the
cool
breeze
for
a
long
time
we
sat
in
front
of
the
fire
chatting
but
at
one
o
clock
ralph
got
up
and
exclaimed
that
it
was
high
time
we
turned
into
bed
hullo
look
at
greg
he
said
pointing
to
the
dog
who
was
crouching
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
door
showing
its
teeth
in
a
series
of
savage
growls
what
s
the
matter
with
him
before
i
had
time
to
reply
we
suddenly
heard
a
regular
measured
tap
tap
tap
as
of
shoes
coming
along
the
corridor
towards
our
door
that
can
t
be
either
the
caretaker
or
his
wife
ralph
whispered
i
wonder
if
it
s
the
young
lady
perhaps
she
s
going
to
pay
us
a
surreptitious
visit
i
only
wish
she
little
darling
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
steps
until
they
seemed
to
stop
just
outside
our
door
greg
s
hair
bristled
he
gave
a
deep
growl
and
retreated
half
way
across
the
room
then
there
came
a
loud
knock
on
the
door
followed
by
the
sound
of
a
violent
scuffle
springing
forward
ralph
threw
the
door
wide
open
there
was
nothing
there
only
the
cold
light
of
the
moon
and
the
white
motionless
faces
of
the
dennings
ancestors
hanging
on
the
walls
it
s
deuced
odd
ralph
said
i
swear
i
heard
steps
and
a
knock
and
yet
there
s
nothing
to
account
for
it
could
it
have
been
rats
i
don
t
think
so
i
said
rats
wouldn
t
have
frightened
greg
look
at
him
now
he
has
quite
greg
had
come
to
my
side
and
was
licking
my
hand
and
wagging
his
tail
in
the
morning
i
asked
the
caretaker
s
wife
if
the
place
was
haunted
haunted
she
stammered
no
whatever
made
you
think
of
such
a
thing
sir
there
ain
t
no
such
things
as
ghosts
it
s
them
howls
you
seeing
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
out
of
her
ralph
and
i
did
not
refer
to
the
subject
again
but
spent
our
time
reading
in
the
library
and
wandering
about
the
heath
in
the
evening
we
sauntered
out
into
the
garden
and
tried
to
coax
greg
to
come
with
us
but
he
resolutely
refused
and
so
we
had
to
leave
him
behind
just
about
the
same
time
as
on
the
previous
evening
and
in
identically
the
same
place
we
again
saw
the
girl
i
ll
speak
to
her
hanged
if
i
don
t
ralph
muttered
and
taking
off
his
hat
he
stepped
forward
and
accosted
her
without
apparently
perceiving
us
she
passed
resolutely
on
and
entering
the
spinney
was
speedily
lost
to
sight
almost
directly
afterwards
the
same
awful
wailing
scream
rose
shrill
and
high
on
the
still
night
air
this
time
we
did
not
rush
after
her
but
walking
hurriedly
back
to
the
house
we
sought
the
companionship
of
the
bright
and
cheery
fireside
at
one
o
clock
we
were
again
seated
in
our
bedroom
and
the
events
of
the
preceding
night
were
repeated
in
every
detail
on
the
morrow
tom
joined
us
when
we
told
him
of
the
ghost
he
became
intensely
interested
it
must
be
my
ancestress
he
said
the
girl
who
was
supposed
to
have
murdered
somebody
i
ll
sit
up
with
you
two
fellows
and
we
ll
have
the
door
after
dinner
we
all
three
went
into
the
garden
it
s
here
we
first
caught
sight
of
her
ralph
exclaimed
as
we
halted
on
the
lawn
here
and
precisely
at
this
hour
jove
there
she
is
i
looked
and
there
was
the
figure
i
knew
so
well
tripping
daintily
towards
us
her
yellow
hair
and
silver
shoe
buckles
gleaming
furiously
in
the
moonlight
she
wears
a
hood
tom
cried
and
it
completely
hides
her
what
ralph
retorted
she
has
no
hood
you
must
be
as
before
the
girl
passed
us
and
we
lost
sight
of
her
amongst
the
trees
the
next
moment
and
we
again
heard
her
scream
then
we
searched
everywhere
but
with
no
result
she
was
certainly
not
on
the
premises
and
as
there
was
no
avenue
of
escape
save
by
scaling
a
ten
foot
wall
we
could
only
conclude
she
had
melted
into
fine
air
in
other
i
ll
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
mystery
tom
growled
between
his
teeth
if
i
root
up
every
tree
in
the
what
you
ve
seen
so
far
ralph
observed
is
only
the
prelude
there
s
more
to
come
and
i
m
not
sure
if
act
ii
is
not
the
most
exciting
what
do
you
think
dick
ask
greg
i
replied
i
believe
he
knows
more
about
it
than
we
on
arriving
indoors
we
all
three
retired
to
the
bedroom
we
had
agreed
to
share
the
night
was
so
exquisite
that
i
sat
by
the
open
window
directly
beneath
me
was
the
gravel
drive
which
lay
like
a
broad
white
belt
encircling
the
house
and
beyond
it
on
the
level
sweep
of
lawn
danced
the
shadows
from
the
larch
and
fir
trees
in
the
paddock
the
only
sign
of
life
came
from
the
bats
and
night
birds
that
wheeled
and
skimmed
in
silent
flight
in
and
out
the
bushes
there
was
very
little
breeze
sufficient
only
to
make
the
ivy
rustle
and
the
window
in
the
corridor
outside
give
the
faintest
perceptible
jar
i
gazed
at
my
companions
ralph
lay
on
the
sofa
sound
asleep
a
look
on
his
handsome
features
while
tom
sat
in
an
armchair
directly
in
front
of
the
fire
his
head
buried
in
the
palms
of
his
hands
as
if
wrapt
in
profound
thought
a
distant
church
clock
boomed
one
greg
growled
and
tom
at
once
springing
up
flung
the
door
widely
back
on
its
hinges
there
he
said
come
what
may
we
re
ready
for
as
he
concluded
there
came
a
tapping
tap
tap
tap
someone
in
shoes
was
walking
over
the
polished
oak
boards
of
the
corridor
in
our
direction
to
me
there
was
a
world
of
stealth
and
cautiousness
in
the
sounds
that
suggested
a
host
of
conflicting
motives
as
the
steps
drew
nearer
the
door
suddenly
swung
to
with
a
loud
crash
and
before
we
had
time
to
recover
from
our
astonishment
someone
rapped
with
a
shout
of
baffled
rage
tom
leaped
to
his
feet
and
tore
at
the
handle
the
massive
door
at
once
flew
open
the
corridor
was
moonbeams
and
more
the
following
day
was
wet
and
we
stayed
indoors
all
the
morning
and
afternoon
reading
as
it
cleared
up
a
little
towards
tom
proposed
going
for
a
short
walk
we
slipped
on
our
overcoats
and
were
crossing
the
big
entrance
hall
to
the
front
door
when
tom
suddenly
exclaimed
hang
it
i
ve
left
my
pipe
upstairs
i
say
wait
a
minute
you
fellows
till
i
get
he
started
running
and
then
stopped
short
giving
vent
to
a
loud
exclamation
ascending
the
broad
staircase
in
front
of
us
was
a
form
whose
back
view
exactly
resembled
that
of
the
beauty
we
had
seen
in
the
garden
where
she
had
sprung
from
we
could
not
say
we
only
knew
she
was
there
by
jove
i
ll
see
her
face
this
time
tom
said
i
ll
see
it
even
if
i
have
to
force
her
to
turn
he
ran
after
her
and
mounting
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
stretched
out
his
hand
to
pluck
at
her
sleeve
she
turned
and
her
face
was
to
us
a
blank
what
tom
saw
we
never
knew
shouting
take
the
damned
thing
away
from
me
he
stepped
back
and
fell
and
when
we
ran
forward
we
found
him
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
the
property
miss
carmichael
informed
me
passed
to
a
distant
relative
who
after
trying
in
vain
to
let
it
pulled
it
down
the
ghost
it
was
rumoured
was
that
of
a
very
beautiful
ancestress
of
the
dennings
who
after
leading
a
life
evil
even
for
those
times
disappeared
what
happened
to
her
material
body
no
one
ever
knew
but
her
spirit
was
supposed
to
haunt
the
house
and
grounds
in
dual
form
to
the
stranger
that
is
to
say
to
those
outside
her
own
family
she
appeared
in
all
the
radiant
beauty
of
her
earthly
body
but
to
the
dennings
she
seldom
revealed
her
face
when
she
did
they
beheld
something
too
terrible
for
the
mind
to
live
i
have
heard
miss
carmichael
added
that
the
ghost
has
been
seen
quite
recently
haunting
the
site
once
occupied
by
the
house
and
grounds
and
also
the
borders
of
the
and
as
miss
carmichael
was
very
emphatic
on
this
last
point
i
may
not
unreasonably
conclude
that
the
girl
of
my
dreams
was
the
actual
ghost
of
the
chapter
x
my
views
on
a
future
life
for
the
animal
and
vegetable
worlds
i
mentioned
in
one
of
my
former
works
that
i
believe
many
of
the
figures
we
pass
by
in
the
streets
are
not
men
and
women
like
ourselves
but
of
the
living
that
is
to
say
spirit
projections
of
people
consciously
or
unconsciously
thinking
of
being
where
we
see
of
the
dead
and
impersonating
neutrarians
mingling
with
the
crowds
in
the
parks
and
gliding
in
and
out
the
trees
i
have
often
seen
people
with
the
pallor
of
corpses
i
have
followed
them
and
they
have
unaccountably
vanished
i
believe
hyde
park
particularly
the
northern
side
to
be
as
full
of
ghosts
as
any
spot
in
london
and
i
have
heard
many
strange
tales
from
the
outcasts
the
tattered
and
torn
brigade
who
have
slept
all
night
under
its
trees
and
bushes
the
police
are
i
believe
expected
to
clear
the
park
before
time
and
i
ve
no
doubt
they
try
to
do
so
but
they
can
not
possibly
look
into
every
nook
and
cranny
in
that
vast
expanse
and
there
are
many
in
which
one
could
easily
hide
and
defy
detection
i
have
tried
the
experiment
once
and
i
am
not
anxious
to
try
it
again
there
is
no
place
so
terribly
depressing
so
strangely
suggestive
of
suicide
and
hauntings
by
the
most
grotesque
type
of
neutrarians
as
london
s
premier
park
by
night
some
twelve
or
fifteen
years
ago
in
my
nightly
rambles
there
i
noticed
that
the
seat
beneath
a
certain
tree
between
the
marble
arch
and
lancaster
gate
was
rarely
occupied
whereas
all
the
other
seats
in
that
vicinity
were
invaded
by
couples
one
evening
the
weather
being
warm
and
sultry
i
went
and
sat
there
i
dozed
off
and
eventually
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
i
dreamed
that
an
old
man
and
a
young
girl
stood
under
the
tree
whispering
and
that
as
i
watched
them
they
raised
their
eyes
and
looked
in
a
horribly
guilty
manner
not
at
me
but
at
the
space
next
me
which
i
perceived
for
the
first
time
was
occupied
by
a
tiny
child
moving
stealthily
forward
and
holding
in
their
hands
an
outspread
cloth
they
crept
up
behind
the
child
the
cloth
descended
and
all
three
vanished
then
something
made
me
gaze
up
into
the
branches
of
the
tree
and
i
saw
a
large
light
colourless
eye
peering
down
at
me
with
an
expression
of
the
utmost
malevolence
it
was
altogether
so
baneful
so
symbolic
of
cruelty
malice
and
hate
that
i
could
only
stare
back
at
it
in
mute
astonishment
the
whole
shape
of
the
tree
then
seemed
to
alter
and
to
become
like
an
enormous
dark
hand
which
swaying
violently
to
and
fro
suddenly
dived
down
and
closed
over
me
i
awoke
at
once
but
was
so
afraid
of
seeing
the
eye
that
for
some
minutes
i
kept
my
own
eyes
tightly
shut
when
i
opened
them
i
saw
bending
over
me
a
very
white
face
and
to
my
intense
relief
a
voice
unmistakably
human
croaked
no
wonder
you
re
scared
sitting
here
at
this
time
of
night
by
the
speaker
was
merely
one
of
the
many
hundreds
of
tramps
for
whom
the
park
was
reception
and
bedroom
combined
his
hat
was
little
more
than
a
rim
and
his
trousers
cried
shame
on
the
ladies
i
saw
every
day
with
their
skirts
plastered
all
over
with
buttons
his
cheeks
were
hollow
his
eyes
preternaturally
bright
and
his
breath
full
of
hunger
still
he
was
alive
and
anything
alive
just
then
was
very
welcome
i
never
sleep
here
he
said
none
of
us
why
i
asked
because
it
s
haunted
he
said
you
may
did
i
years
ago
afore
i
took
to
this
sort
of
thing
but
sleeping
all
night
has
taught
me
more
than
any
politicians
bishops
or
schoolmasters
know
or
any
of
those
fine
ladies
that
swell
about
in
their
carriages
know
i
ve
seen
sights
that
would
make
an
hangel
afraid
i
ve
seen
ghosts
of
all
sorts
they
re
not
all
like
us
neither
some
of
them
ain
t
human
at
all
they
re
devils
you
may
laugh
when
you
read
about
them
in
them
library
books
but
it
s
no
laughing
matter
when
you
see
them
as
i
ve
seen
them
all
alone
and
cold
in
some
wayside
ditch
this
tree
i
tell
yer
is
it
s
a
devil
that
aunts
it
ask
my
mates
any
of
them
that
you
ll
find
sleeping
in
the
parks
there
s
many
of
them
that
ave
experienced
it
they
ve
seen
something
hiding
in
the
branches
and
when
they
ve
seen
it
they
ve
felt
they
must
either
kill
themselves
or
someone
else
there
s
a
devil
in
the
tree
that
tempts
one
to
do
all
kind
of
wicked
things
and
if
you
take
my
advice
young
man
you
ll
sit
somewhere
i
think
i
will
i
said
and
here
s
something
for
your
i
gave
him
threepence
the
only
coins
i
had
on
me
just
then
and
overwhelming
me
with
thanks
he
shuffled
away
since
that
night
i
have
often
thought
that
the
very
far
more
of
the
other
world
or
worlds
than
do
the
rich
and
that
they
know
other
points
than
the
rich
the
statesman
talks
of
the
people
and
the
people
s
needs
but
what
does
he
know
of
the
people
and
their
needs
he
rarely
if
ever
goes
amongst
them
except
in
electioneering
times
i
doubt
if
any
member
of
parliament
ever
goes
into
the
more
squalid
of
our
london
districts
i
have
seen
one
member
of
the
house
of
lords
eating
whelks
in
a
tavern
in
the
limehouse
causeway
but
he
is
an
exception
journalists
go
the
leisured
it
bores
them
and
yet
how
much
they
might
learn
how
much
not
only
of
urgent
human
needs
but
of
coming
storms
they
might
learn
that
the
east
end
brews
whilst
the
west
end
sleeps
and
that
as
surely
as
the
german
war
war
cloud
they
affected
to
at
last
burst
so
undoubtedly
will
the
war
cloud
of
revolution
revolution
hatched
by
malcontents
of
all
nationalities
in
east
end
doss
houses
and
crowded
coffee
taverns
this
is
no
empty
prophecy
the
cinders
of
the
volcano
have
been
hot
for
some
are
now
burning
the
hour
is
fast
approaching
when
they
will
arise
mightily
in
a
red
conflagration
are
we
prepared
for
it
it
takes
a
very
sound
constitution
to
face
a
revolution
with
perfect
confidence
are
we
sound
can
any
constitution
be
sound
when
the
rich
daily
grow
richer
and
the
poor
poorer
where
that
cries
out
for
beauty
real
beauty
beauty
as
it
is
seen
and
worshipped
by
souls
uninspired
by
starved
to
death
and
crushed
limp
and
lifeless
by
the
thumbscrews
of
a
vain
shallow
mercenary
mushroom
aristocracy
on
the
one
hand
and
an
equally
selfish
crude
ignorant
working
class
on
the
other
but
let
me
say
again
it
is
the
east
end
the
ever
watchful
never
slumbering
east
end
that
is
the
thermometer
of
future
events
and
why
because
it
is
here
that
the
lean
hungry
men
of
letters
who
seldom
if
ever
get
their
thoughts
transferred
to
print
are
even
now
threshing
out
the
nation
s
destiny
threshing
it
out
consolidating
it
whilst
the
monied
men
and
women
the
present
nouveau
beer
whiskey
and
tobacco
peers
and
lords
of
the
stock
exchange
banks
and
divorce
who
have
made
their
money
out
of
the
sins
and
follies
of
the
world
or
by
sweating
and
usury
are
lolling
in
their
soft
upholstered
chairs
smoking
luxurious
cigars
and
quaffing
liqueurs
the
war
has
done
much
it
has
aroused
patriotism
it
has
given
rise
to
but
it
has
not
touched
the
root
of
the
gangrene
it
has
not
lessened
our
worship
of
the
dollar
individualism
as
we
know
it
must
collapse
and
some
better
and
purer
system
that
does
not
encourage
prevail
the
people
are
dying
for
some
great
change
that
will
give
them
fair
play
this
is
the
people
s
need
that
you
may
hear
voiced
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
squalid
east
end
we
want
a
government
that
remembers
its
primary
duties
they
cry
a
government
that
is
father
to
its
children
that
loves
fosters
and
protects
them
we
have
never
had
one
yet
but
the
hour
may
not
be
far
distant
when
we
shall
demand
this
is
what
the
people
of
leisure
might
learn
if
they
visited
the
haunts
i
visit
and
they
might
learn
more
beside
they
might
learn
of
another
world
a
spirit
world
such
as
is
never
alluded
to
in
the
pulpits
with
which
people
in
the
poorest
who
are
too
poor
to
pay
for
forced
to
live
in
contact
nights
in
the
parks
and
commons
have
taught
these
vagrants
more
a
thousand
times
more
than
they
ever
learned
in
sunday
or
county
council
schools
they
have
seen
in
the
form
of
man
and
of
beast
of
both
and
of
have
revealed
to
them
how
closely
the
other
world
borders
on
this
and
to
what
close
supervision
the
inhabitants
of
the
other
world
subject
some
of
us
they
have
learned
i
say
what
no
priest
or
preacher
would
or
could
teach
them
namely
that
the
hell
of
lies
on
this
earth
and
that
the
worst
of
all
punishments
is
that
of
the
poor
phantasms
of
the
dead
that
glides
in
and
out
the
trees
nocturnally
never
meeting
those
it
knew
and
loved
but
ever
encountering
the
most
terrifying
of
the
spirits
that
are
hostile
to
man
illustration
what
gives
me
the
worst
fright
is
a
tree
our
vagrants
know
too
the
power
of
these
neutrarians
they
know
they
can
adopt
any
shape
and
tempt
and
goad
man
on
to
the
committal
of
any
crime
however
heinous
they
have
moreover
acquired
a
further
knowledge
denied
and
scoffed
at
by
the
ministry
of
all
christian
that
all
forms
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
all
forms
of
flora
and
fauna
pass
into
the
superphysical
and
live
again
i
myself
first
learned
of
a
tree
ghost
from
an
old
tramp
who
came
and
sat
by
my
side
on
a
seat
on
clapham
common
do
i
ever
see
anything
strange
here
at
night
he
repeated
in
answer
to
my
question
yes
i
do
at
times
but
what
gives
me
the
worst
fright
is
a
tree
that
i
sometimes
see
close
to
the
spot
where
that
man
was
murdered
some
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
i
never
saw
it
before
the
murder
but
a
few
nights
afterwards
as
i
was
passing
the
spot
i
saw
a
peculiar
glimmer
of
white
and
on
getting
a
bit
closer
i
found
to
my
astonishment
that
it
was
a
tall
slender
white
thing
with
branches
just
like
a
tree
only
it
was
not
behaving
like
a
tree
although
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
it
kept
lurching
with
a
strange
creaking
noise
and
i
felt
it
was
watching
me
watching
me
furtively
just
as
if
it
had
eyes
and
was
bent
on
doing
me
all
the
harm
it
possibly
could
i
was
so
scared
i
turned
tail
and
never
ceased
running
till
i
had
reached
home
i
said
yes
a
clump
of
bushes
near
the
ditch
where
i
always
turn
in
of
nights
it
ain
t
much
of
a
home
to
be
sure
but
it
s
the
only
one
i
ve
got
and
i
can
generally
count
on
lying
there
undisturbed
till
the
i
gave
him
a
few
coppers
and
he
blessed
me
as
if
i
had
given
him
a
fortune
on
tooting
common
i
met
a
northumberland
miner
who
had
come
to
london
for
the
first
time
on
a
holiday
and
having
had
his
pocket
picked
was
obliged
to
spend
the
night
ghosts
he
said
when
i
asked
him
if
he
had
any
experiences
with
the
supernatural
whilst
engaged
in
his
underground
work
ghosts
yes
but
of
a
nature
you
don
t
read
about
in
books
me
and
my
mates
when
working
in
a
drift
at
night
have
heard
the
blowing
of
the
wind
and
a
mighty
rustling
of
leaves
and
have
found
ourselves
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
numerous
trees
and
ferns
that
have
suddenly
risen
from
the
ground
and
formed
a
regular
forest
they
have
not
resembled
any
trees
you
see
but
what
you
might
fancy
existed
many
thousands
of
years
ago
there
has
been
no
colour
in
them
only
a
uniform
whiteness
and
they
have
shone
like
phosphorous
we
have
heard
too
all
the
noises
such
as
go
on
daily
in
forests
humming
and
buzzing
of
insects
and
the
chirping
of
birds
and
shafts
and
galleries
have
echoed
and
with
the
sounds
till
you
would
have
thought
that
those
away
above
us
must
have
heard
them
i
do
not
think
the
miner
romanced
for
what
he
said
was
only
a
corroboration
of
what
other
miners
have
often
told
me
of
course
it
is
not
every
mine
that
is
haunted
in
this
way
or
every
miner
that
sees
such
sights
for
the
unknown
confines
its
manifestations
to
the
few
but
i
firmly
believe
such
phenomena
do
happen
because
as
i
state
in
my
byways
of
ghostland
rider
sons
i
have
seen
several
tree
ghosts
myself
if
one
form
of
life
possesses
a
spirit
why
should
we
not
assume
that
other
forms
of
life
possess
a
spirit
too
why
should
man
have
the
monopoly
of
an
immaterial
self
and
alone
of
all
creation
continue
his
identity
after
physical
dissolution
on
moral
grounds
no
for
man
generally
speaking
is
in
no
sense
superior
morally
to
the
beasts
around
him
he
is
often
the
reverse
oddly
enough
we
have
so
long
accustomed
ourselves
to
using
the
term
immorality
exclusively
in
reference
to
our
illegal
relations
with
the
other
sex
that
we
have
come
to
regard
these
illegal
relations
as
the
only
immorality
existing
it
is
a
curious
error
immorality
comprises
theft
and
theft
not
only
comprehends
depriving
people
of
their
material
goods
it
comprehends
slander
and
depriving
people
of
their
character
depriving
people
of
the
just
rewards
of
their
mental
and
manual
labour
and
depriving
people
of
their
only
means
of
existence
beside
many
other
acts
of
an
equally
odious
nature
the
average
is
invariably
the
rendezvous
of
immoral
people
nine
out
of
every
ten
of
the
ladies
one
meets
there
are
steal
almost
at
very
breath
someone
s
good
name
and
reputation
a
far
worse
crime
than
the
purloining
of
a
loaf
for
which
act
of
desperation
a
poor
man
would
be
sent
to
prison
and
a
hungry
dog
beaten
in
the
too
one
meets
the
girl
with
a
few
hundred
a
year
who
announces
her
intention
of
taking
some
on
the
stage
or
on
the
staff
of
some
paper
or
in
a
business
house
just
to
make
a
little
a
little
money
at
the
expense
of
someone
else
s
life
for
that
is
what
the
want
of
occupation
to
the
person
with
no
private
income
literally
means
we
see
none
of
this
mean
immorality
in
the
animal
world
dogs
steal
bones
from
one
another
it
is
true
but
they
do
not
lie
and
cheat
and
intrigue
nor
do
they
when
they
have
a
sufficiency
themselves
snatch
away
the
little
that
constitutes
another
person
s
all
animals
are
accused
of
being
barbarously
murdering
one
another
as
in
the
cases
of
the
cat
and
mouse
the
lion
and
deer
etc
but
they
rarely
kill
saving
when
they
are
hungry
and
for
food
man
kills
too
in
a
fashion
and
with
a
method
which
is
truly
disgusting
by
studiously
looking
after
the
daily
wants
of
certain
animals
such
as
cows
and
sheep
and
by
caring
for
them
when
they
are
ill
man
leads
them
to
suppose
he
is
their
friend
and
they
learn
to
trust
him
vain
faith
he
is
kind
to
them
only
to
suit
his
own
ends
he
s
judas
and
after
nonchalantly
accepting
their
most
lavish
tributes
of
affection
he
takes
them
unawares
and
kills
them
either
with
a
poleaxe
or
some
other
weapon
entailing
an
equally
painful
and
lingering
death
do
any
animals
behave
quite
so
basely
besides
there
is
no
cruelty
in
the
animal
even
the
most
excruciating
suction
of
the
octopus
nor
the
sharp
agonising
bite
of
the
parrot
of
new
can
for
one
moment
compare
with
the
coolly
planned
and
leisurely
executed
horrors
of
the
spanish
inquisition
and
the
tiger
at
its
worst
is
but
a
tyro
in
savagery
compared
with
the
creature
god
is
said
to
have
made
in
his
own
image
from
vices
turn
to
virtues
and
pause
for
a
moment
in
reflection
on
the
many
lovable
qualities
of
the
dog
where
in
man
do
we
find
such
affection
forgiveness
general
amiability
constancy
and
patience
and
in
the
case
of
the
horse
such
a
willingness
to
labour
without
any
thought
of
recompense
it
makes
me
positively
ill
when
i
hear
hopelessly
immoral
men
and
slanderers
breadsnatchers
usurers
condescendingly
of
dogs
and
horses
that
are
on
an
infinitely
higher
moral
plane
than
ever
they
have
been
or
ever
will
be
but
moral
superiority
is
not
the
only
superiority
that
man
fallaciously
assumes
he
lays
claim
to
an
intellectual
superiority
which
is
equally
fallacious
equally
a
myth
no
one
who
has
ever
studied
animal
and
insect
life
can
but
have
been
impressed
with
the
marvels
of
ingenuity
and
skill
displayed
therein
the
web
of
the
common
garden
spider
and
the
nest
of
the
wren
for
example
are
every
whit
as
wonderful
in
their
way
as
the
architectural
works
of
inigo
jones
or
christopher
wren
on
the
grounds
of
a
moral
and
mental
inferiority
therefore
the
argument
of
a
future
life
for
the
human
species
only
fails
another
argument
an
argument
advanced
by
the
most
bigotted
of
the
religious
denominationalists
is
that
man
only
has
a
conscience
and
that
conscience
which
he
alone
possesses
is
the
only
passport
to
another
world
without
conscience
there
can
be
no
soul
and
without
soul
there
can
be
no
hope
of
a
continuation
of
life
after
this
of
course
is
merely
assumption
as
is
nearly
all
the
teaching
of
the
churches
conscience
like
religion
depends
to
a
very
large
extent
on
climate
a
man
born
in
the
centre
of
africa
might
not
think
it
wrong
to
do
things
that
would
appear
appalling
to
a
plymouth
brother
and
vice
versa
there
is
at
present
no
fixed
and
universal
standard
of
right
and
wrong
any
more
than
there
is
a
fixed
and
universal
standard
of
as
each
eye
forms
its
own
idea
of
feminine
loveliness
so
each
heart
forms
its
own
conception
of
honour
and
dishonour
virtue
and
vice
we
know
that
this
is
the
case
as
far
as
mankind
is
concerned
and
we
have
nothing
beyond
assumption
to
assure
us
that
it
is
not
so
throughout
the
animal
and
insect
world
if
the
animals
have
no
conception
of
a
moral
standard
how
is
it
that
they
do
not
destroy
one
another
that
the
instinct
to
injure
people
is
innate
in
us
is
readily
proved
by
the
joy
nearly
all
of
us
take
in
saying
disparaging
things
of
our
neighbours
we
go
so
far
and
we
would
undoubtedly
go
the
whole
hog
and
kill
those
we
hate
if
something
more
perhaps
than
the
mere
fear
of
hanging
did
not
hold
us
back
that
restraining
something
is
unquestionably
the
fear
of
the
future
and
it
is
that
fear
which
i
am
inclined
to
think
is
the
origin
of
what
we
term
our
consciences
were
we
sure
there
was
no
future
existence
there
would
be
no
moral
restraint
it
would
only
be
the
prospect
of
legal
punishment
that
would
deter
us
from
injuring
other
people
to
our
heart
s
content
we
should
have
no
consciences
and
if
this
is
applicable
to
mankind
why
is
it
not
applicable
to
other
forms
of
animal
life
is
it
not
feasible
to
suppose
that
it
is
this
same
fear
of
the
future
that
acts
as
a
preventive
to
animals
killing
one
another
indiscriminately
that
they
do
at
times
rob
and
kill
for
other
motives
than
to
satisfy
their
hunger
is
indisputable
but
these
exceptional
cases
prove
what
i
am
trying
to
there
is
some
restraining
influence
that
keeps
the
vast
majority
highly
moral
and
i
see
no
feasible
arguments
for
not
supposing
this
influence
to
be
a
conscience
begat
by
a
fear
of
what
may
await
them
on
physical
dissolution
and
if
this
applies
to
the
mammals
why
not
to
the
whole
animal
insect
and
vegetable
everything
that
has
life
for
science
has
yet
to
prove
that
where
there
is
life
there
is
not
also
intelligence
the
superior
morality
of
animals
to
man
then
may
be
considered
as
due
to
their
more
powerful
consciences
and
to
their
stronger
fear
of
the
possibility
of
the
superphysical
and
why
should
they
have
a
much
stronger
fear
because
unquestionably
they
have
a
more
intimate
knowledge
of
the
unknown
than
has
man
no
one
who
has
had
much
to
do
with
dogs
and
horses
can
doubt
this
who
that
has
ridden
through
woods
and
jungles
or
lonely
country
roads
at
night
has
not
seen
their
horse
suddenly
stop
and
evince
every
evidence
of
fear
though
the
human
eye
has
seen
nothing
to
account
for
it
the
horse
obviously
has
seen
something
and
it
has
only
been
by
dint
of
the
utmost
coaxing
and
petting
that
the
sagacious
animal
has
been
persuaded
to
continue
its
course
it
is
the
same
with
dogs
over
and
over
again
i
have
had
dogs
with
me
in
houses
alleged
to
be
haunted
and
they
have
suddenly
manifested
symptoms
of
the
greatest
the
most
uncontrollable
fear
i
have
endeavoured
to
pacify
them
to
urge
them
to
follow
me
but
it
has
been
in
vain
though
obedient
and
fearless
as
a
rule
they
have
suddenly
become
the
most
disobedient
and
incorrigible
of
cowards
why
because
i
am
certain
they
have
seen
and
heard
things
which
for
some
unaccountable
reason
have
been
held
back
from
me
if
knowledge
then
of
another
life
is
any
plea
for
the
bestowal
of
an
unperishable
spirit
animals
should
live
again
even
more
surely
than
man
and
so
also
should
the
vegetable
world
for
i
have
myself
seen
trees
violently
agitated
as
if
with
paroxysms
of
the
most
sublime
terror
before
the
advent
of
superphysical
phenomena
and
stronger
than
any
of
these
arguments
is
that
of
the
ghosts
themselves
there
are
innumerable
and
cases
of
hauntings
by
the
phantasms
of
dogs
horses
birds
insects
and
trees
and
it
is
perhaps
chiefly
through
these
hauntings
that
we
can
disprove
the
theory
that
man
possesses
a
monopoly
of
the
immaterial
planes
a
theory
which
were
it
not
for
his
insufferable
egotism
and
conceit
he
would
never
have
advanced
chapter
xi
a
haunting
in
regent
s
park
and
my
further
views
with
regard
to
spiritualism
before
concluding
my
experiences
in
the
parks
and
commons
of
london
i
will
cite
one
other
case
a
case
which
serves
to
illustrate
the
theme
i
have
just
been
discussing
i
was
visiting
the
zoological
gardens
in
regent
s
park
one
day
in
the
summer
of
and
was
so
struck
with
the
look
of
yearning
in
the
eyes
of
one
of
the
lions
the
desperate
look
of
yearning
to
have
just
five
minutes
gambol
on
the
sunny
lawn
outside
five
minutes
in
which
to
stretch
its
poor
limbs
and
sniff
perhaps
for
the
first
time
the
fine
fresh
air
of
freedom
that
i
could
not
refrain
from
mentioning
what
was
passing
in
my
mind
to
a
old
man
and
a
plainly
dressed
young
woman
who
were
standing
near
yes
sir
the
old
man
said
it
does
seem
hard
on
these
huge
animals
to
be
confined
within
the
limits
of
such
a
very
small
space
and
to
have
to
pace
up
and
down
these
little
boxes
tantalised
by
the
sight
of
other
creatures
enjoying
the
privileges
that
are
denied
to
them
it
is
worse
treatment
than
any
meted
out
to
criminals
in
fact
the
biggest
ruffian
in
jail
does
not
suffer
in
anything
like
the
same
degree
as
these
animals
they
have
one
thing
to
be
thankful
for
can
not
last
for
ever
death
will
be
their
kindest
friend
it
is
the
rich
man
s
purgatory
but
it
is
paradise
for
all
these
creatures
as
well
as
for
the
poor
you
believe
in
another
world
then
i
remarked
believe
in
another
world
he
answered
sharply
why
of
course
i
do
i
have
seen
far
too
much
of
it
to
do
otherwise
haven
t
i
minnie
yes
grandad
the
girl
said
simply
we
both
have
minnie
and
i
the
old
man
went
on
spirits
i
enquired
yes
spirits
ghosts
if
you
like
he
said
tell
me
i
m
not
one
of
the
scoffers
i
pleaded
he
looked
at
me
searchingly
and
then
said
i
used
to
be
a
keeper
here
many
years
ago
i
was
devoted
to
the
animals
and
when
they
died
i
invariably
saw
their
ghosts
so
did
some
of
the
other
keepers
now
don
t
run
away
with
the
idea
that
the
gardens
are
haunted
sir
as
far
as
i
know
they
are
not
it
was
only
to
us
who
had
so
much
to
do
with
them
when
they
were
alive
that
the
spirits
of
these
animals
appeared
i
remember
one
instance
in
particular
about
twelve
years
ago
just
before
i
left
the
zoo
a
young
lion
came
here
from
east
africa
it
wouldn
t
let
any
of
the
keepers
go
near
it
excepting
myself
and
it
was
generally
regarded
as
having
a
very
uncertain
temper
but
i
never
found
it
so
i
knew
that
the
reason
of
its
restlessness
was
its
hatred
of
confinement
i
knew
it
hated
its
cage
and
i
used
to
do
all
i
could
to
comfort
it
there
was
a
sort
of
mutual
understanding
between
us
when
it
saw
me
looking
a
bit
anxious
and
worried
for
my
wife
was
often
ill
it
used
to
come
and
rub
its
great
head
against
me
as
if
to
cheer
me
up
and
when
i
saw
it
looking
more
than
usually
dejected
i
used
to
stop
and
talk
to
it
for
a
longer
time
than
i
talked
to
any
one
of
the
other
animals
well
one
day
it
fell
ill
caught
a
chill
so
we
thought
and
evinced
a
strong
dislike
to
its
food
i
discussed
its
case
with
the
other
keepers
and
they
agreed
there
was
nothing
to
be
alarmed
about
as
it
was
young
and
to
all
appearances
healthy
we
all
thought
it
would
be
well
again
in
a
few
days
i
had
gone
home
as
usual
one
night
and
was
sitting
in
the
kitchen
reading
the
evening
paper
when
something
came
over
me
that
i
must
go
for
a
walk
i
told
minnie
who
was
a
little
girl
then
not
more
than
nine
or
ten
years
of
age
and
she
begged
her
mother
to
let
her
go
with
me
we
started
off
with
the
intention
of
going
to
the
caledonian
road
as
minnie
liked
looking
at
the
shops
there
but
we
hadn
t
gone
far
before
minnie
suddenly
exclaimed
grandad
let
s
go
to
regent
s
regent
s
park
i
ejaculated
whatever
do
you
want
to
go
there
for
at
this
time
of
night
i
don
t
know
she
said
but
i
feel
i
well
now
i
replied
that
s
odd
because
the
very
same
feeling
has
come
over
we
struck
off
down
crowndale
was
living
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
pancras
road
got
to
gloucester
gate
just
about
dusk
we
had
passed
through
and
were
walking
along
the
broad
walk
by
the
side
of
the
zoo
when
minnie
suddenly
caught
hold
of
my
arm
and
said
look
grandad
i
followed
the
direction
of
her
gaze
and
there
coming
straight
towards
us
from
the
zoo
walls
was
a
lion
i
can
tell
you
it
gave
me
a
jump
as
i
naturally
thought
one
of
the
animals
had
escaped
it
aimed
straight
for
us
and
upon
its
getting
close
to
i
recognised
it
at
was
the
young
lion
that
had
been
taken
to
my
astonishment
however
there
was
nothing
of
the
invalid
about
it
now
the
expression
in
its
eyes
was
one
of
infinite
happiness
it
seemed
to
say
i
have
attained
my
ideal
i
am
out
in
the
open
in
the
sweet
fresh
air
and
the
wide
darkness
of
the
fast
approaching
it
came
right
up
to
us
and
i
stretched
out
my
hand
to
touch
it
wondering
what
the
would
do
when
they
saw
it
and
how
on
earth
we
should
get
it
back
into
the
gardens
it
bitterly
grieved
me
to
think
it
would
have
to
lose
its
freedom
i
stretched
out
my
hand
i
say
to
touch
it
and
to
my
surprise
my
fingers
encountered
lion
had
vanished
i
then
realised
what
minnie
had
known
all
what
we
had
seen
was
a
ghost
a
ghost
and
yet
it
had
appeared
to
me
so
absolutely
real
and
how
did
you
know
it
was
a
ghost
i
enquired
of
the
young
woman
by
the
curious
kind
of
light
that
seemed
to
emanate
from
all
over
its
body
she
replied
i
can
only
describe
it
as
a
kind
of
glow
something
like
that
of
a
it
was
not
a
bit
but
you
saw
the
figure
distinctly
yes
she
responded
very
distinctly
and
i
wasn
t
the
least
bit
let
me
tell
you
the
sequel
sir
the
old
man
interrupted
on
my
arrival
at
the
zoo
in
the
morning
one
of
the
men
came
running
up
to
me
it
s
dead
he
said
dead
i
cried
who
s
dead
why
that
young
lion
of
yours
was
the
reply
it
died
at
eight
o
clock
last
and
sure
enough
when
i
went
into
the
there
was
the
animal
lying
stretched
out
at
full
length
in
its
it
had
died
at
eight
o
clock
which
was
the
exact
time
we
had
seen
it
in
the
and
now
to
pursue
the
thread
of
my
own
life
which
must
of
necessity
run
through
this
volume
while
i
was
teaching
at
blackheath
i
not
only
completed
my
first
novel
for
satan
s
sake
but
studied
for
the
stage
at
the
henry
neville
studio
in
oxford
street
i
shall
never
forget
with
what
joy
when
my
duties
with
the
spoilt
and
tiresome
boys
were
over
i
exchanged
the
terrible
monotony
of
the
schoolroom
for
the
delightful
and
interesting
atmosphere
of
the
studio
henry
neville
did
not
teach
there
himself
but
periodically
came
to
watch
and
help
us
with
his
criticisms
which
were
always
as
kindly
and
instructive
as
they
were
utterly
free
from
pomposity
and
egotism
easy
and
natural
himself
he
tried
to
infuse
something
of
his
spirit
into
us
and
with
many
of
us
i
believe
he
succeeded
for
even
those
who
did
not
believe
that
acting
could
be
taught
were
bound
to
admit
that
the
pupils
of
henry
neville
were
singularly
free
from
the
staginess
almost
always
seen
in
amateurs
and
sometimes
in
professionals
as
well
henry
neville
s
brother
fred
gartside
who
gave
me
my
first
lesson
in
abler
or
more
persevering
instructor
could
not
have
been
off
teaching
at
the
studio
soon
after
i
joined
foss
took
his
place
and
is
i
believe
still
at
the
head
of
it
i
have
always
looked
upon
foss
as
one
of
the
greatest
stage
geniuses
i
have
ever
met
he
is
that
rarest
of
all
born
man
who
can
perform
almost
any
with
equal
success
he
is
the
ideal
stage
manager
a
past
master
in
the
knowledge
of
all
the
technicalities
adhering
to
the
theatre
and
the
possessor
of
a
flow
of
wit
and
good
humour
among
the
pupils
who
were
at
the
studio
with
me
several
have
performed
in
london
i
toured
with
george
desmond
who
was
quite
recently
playing
in
the
west
end
and
i
met
miss
yvonne
orchardson
again
some
two
or
more
years
ago
when
she
was
also
acting
in
a
london
theatre
whilst
i
constantly
see
that
charming
and
talented
old
nevillite
miss
lilian
north
who
delights
london
audiences
with
her
sweetly
told
stories
and
good
recitations
apart
from
many
other
personal
attractions
miss
north
has
the
most
beautiful
hands
the
fingers
are
long
and
tapering
and
the
nails
exquisitely
shaped
it
is
the
rarest
combination
of
the
psychic
and
dramatic
hand
and
such
as
i
have
very
seldom
seen
saving
among
orientals
if
i
have
spoken
somewhat
extravagantly
of
the
neville
studio
its
instructors
and
pupils
it
is
only
what
i
genuinely
feel
and
i
repeat
again
that
the
hours
there
were
some
of
the
most
delightful
i
have
ever
experienced
when
i
had
completed
my
course
of
instruction
i
went
on
tour
in
a
night
i
then
came
back
to
london
and
remained
nearly
a
year
in
town
writing
in
the
and
playing
in
one
or
other
of
the
suburbs
in
the
evening
i
lived
for
the
most
part
in
james
road
brixton
where
i
wrote
my
second
and
third
books
both
novels
and
entitled
respectively
the
unknown
depths
and
dinevah
the
the
unknown
depths
founded
to
a
large
extent
upon
my
own
life
introduces
the
subject
of
spiritualism
or
as
it
is
now
more
often
termed
spiritism
and
whilst
i
was
engaged
on
it
i
attended
many
s√©ances
i
am
often
asked
to
express
an
opinion
on
spiritualism
i
am
very
averse
from
any
attempt
to
invoke
spirits
either
through
the
aid
of
spells
or
mediums
by
or
by
automatic
writing
as
i
have
already
said
i
believe
that
genuine
spirits
do
occasionally
manifest
themselves
at
s√©ances
but
that
when
they
do
the
medium
is
quite
as
surprised
at
the
manifestation
as
the
sitters
and
in
no
greater
a
degree
perhaps
responsible
for
it
i
believe
the
spirit
i
have
named
neutrarian
is
the
only
type
of
spirit
that
takes
advantage
of
a
s√©ance
that
is
to
say
takes
advantage
of
the
peculiar
magnetic
atmosphere
created
at
a
s√©ance
it
adopts
the
form
or
attributes
of
some
relative
or
friend
of
one
of
the
sitters
and
thus
disguised
manifests
itself
merely
for
the
sake
of
deceiving
and
misleading
men
and
women
but
unfortunately
these
spirits
do
not
stop
at
mere
mischief
having
once
gained
a
footing
so
to
speak
they
can
attach
themselves
to
certain
people
and
by
tormenting
them
continually
drive
them
in
the
end
to
madness
and
suicide
in
addition
to
the
danger
of
attracting
undesirable
neutrarians
at
s√©ances
there
is
the
risk
of
being
duped
by
mediums
i
have
met
a
good
many
professional
clairvoyants
aura
tellers
psychometrists
materialising
mediums
and
the
like
and
none
of
them
have
convinced
me
that
they
can
do
all
that
they
profess
to
do
besides
even
if
they
could
the
mere
suggestion
that
one
s
spirit
friend
or
relative
is
tapping
on
a
wall
or
blowing
through
a
trumpet
presumably
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
a
number
of
strangers
and
incidentally
to
fill
the
coffers
of
an
illiterate
man
or
woman
only
fills
one
with
disgust
if
any
departed
friends
of
mine
wish
to
visit
me
i
am
sure
they
could
do
so
without
the
assistance
of
a
medium
and
all
their
paltry
paraphernalia
the
usual
argument
in
defence
of
these
mediums
is
that
some
scientific
man
believes
in
them
if
sir
somebody
or
other
says
i
am
genuine
the
clairvoyant
exclaims
then
i
am
genuine
and
you
ve
no
right
in
the
world
to
doubt
the
medium
is
wrong
i
have
every
right
scientists
may
be
very
shrewd
perhaps
infallible
in
their
own
legitimate
calling
but
outside
it
their
opinion
need
carry
no
more
weight
than
mine
or
yours
or
anyone
else
s
it
by
no
means
follows
that
because
a
man
is
a
professor
of
physics
he
is
also
a
great
student
of
character
poring
over
chemicals
or
figures
all
day
is
a
very
poor
training
for
reading
the
human
mind
an
actor
is
a
far
more
able
exponent
of
psychology
than
any
chemist
or
mathematician
and
this
being
so
it
is
the
actor
who
should
play
a
prominent
part
in
psychical
research
and
not
the
scientist
if
a
veteran
actor
were
to
say
to
me
look
here
i
have
watched
that
woman
very
carefully
when
she
was
supposed
to
go
into
a
trance
and
to
speak
in
an
entirely
different
voice
from
her
own
and
i
am
convinced
she
is
merely
acting
i
should
be
inclined
to
believe
him
in
his
wide
experience
of
facial
expression
posing
and
assumed
voices
it
would
be
comparatively
easy
for
him
to
tell
whether
the
medium
was
shamming
or
not
a
clever
actress
can
disguise
her
voice
effectually
and
no
one
would
know
it
she
can
speak
with
a
french
accent
one
moment
and
broad
cockney
the
next
and
so
naturally
that
few
people
would
know
she
was
the
same
person
that
is
why
when
i
have
listened
to
a
clairvoyant
in
an
alleged
trance
speaking
in
the
voice
of
tommy
jones
or
some
other
presumed
obsessing
spirit
i
have
been
unmoved
there
are
a
dozen
actresses
of
my
acquaintance
who
could
easily
do
the
same
but
someone
exclaims
she
actually
spoke
in
russian
a
language
she
knows
nothing
how
do
you
know
she
is
unacquainted
with
russian
is
my
answer
no
one
can
possibly
tell
that
but
herself
she
has
most
likely
acquired
a
smattering
of
it
simply
for
this
purpose
what
could
be
easier
i
have
a
smattering
of
a
good
many
languages
but
i
could
easily
stimulate
complete
ignorance
of
any
one
or
all
of
them
i
repeat
no
one
knows
but
ourselves
how
much
we
have
seen
and
read
and
heard
where
we
have
been
and
what
we
have
studied
and
if
we
are
sufficiently
clever
we
can
let
the
outside
world
know
just
as
much
as
we
want
it
to
know
and
no
more
some
mediums
are
said
to
act
in
one
manner
when
they
are
obsessed
and
in
an
entirely
different
manner
when
in
their
normal
condition
what
futile
rubbish
who
knows
when
they
are
in
their
normal
condition
or
what
their
normal
condition
really
is
most
of
us
are
complex
i
myself
have
several
distinct
i
defy
anyone
to
enumerate
one
of
which
might
be
equally
my
true
my
normal
self
moreover
i
might
go
into
a
trance
speak
with
the
voice
of
a
spaniard
and
behave
like
a
red
indian
and
those
who
saw
me
would
think
me
obsessed
yet
they
might
easily
be
mistaken
i
might
have
secretly
acquired
a
smattering
of
spanish
and
one
of
my
hobbies
might
be
that
of
imitating
in
private
the
ways
and
habits
of
a
sioux
or
crow
foot
i
know
a
clergyman
who
attracts
large
congregations
by
reason
of
his
eloquence
and
apparent
piety
and
who
is
believed
in
his
parish
to
be
most
moral
and
sincere
i
also
know
him
to
spend
several
evenings
a
week
in
an
east
end
tavern
singing
ribald
songs
and
playing
poker
which
is
his
true
self
which
his
normal
condition
his
congregation
believe
him
to
be
one
thing
his
east
end
cronies
another
and
he
is
apparently
quite
as
much
at
home
in
the
church
as
he
is
in
the
tavern
then
apart
from
the
question
of
personalities
i
believe
another
evidence
of
trickery
lies
in
the
of
any
of
the
communications
alleged
to
be
made
by
the
spirits
if
professional
mediums
could
receive
bona
fide
communications
from
the
other
world
i
am
quite
sure
that
they
would
acquire
some
knowledge
of
a
practical
nature
and
that
we
should
in
consequence
soon
see
them
all
that
they
are
not
all
vanderbilts
and
rothschilds
is
i
think
a
very
strong
argument
that
their
alleged
spirit
friends
have
told
them
nothing
and
that
is
what
it
all
amounts
automatic
writing
and
trances
have
taught
us
absolutely
nothing
concerning
either
this
or
the
other
world
and
the
messages
purporting
to
come
from
the
spirits
have
hitherto
at
all
events
consisted
of
trivialities
and
commonplaces
of
such
an
unedifying
nature
that
we
can
not
dissociate
them
from
factory
girls
and
nursemaids
our
friends
on
the
other
side
who
have
passed
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
know
something
that
we
do
not
and
yet
not
even
the
smallest
fragment
of
their
knowledge
has
so
far
been
transmitted
to
us
through
any
of
the
channels
resorted
to
by
spiritualists
neither
as
far
as
i
know
have
the
police
benefited
by
any
information
imparted
to
them
by
mediums
or
automatic
writers
on
the
other
hand
although
the
unknown
has
refused
to
confide
to
those
claiming
to
be
its
chosen
few
any
messages
that
would
right
the
wrong
bona
fide
phantasms
of
the
dead
have
certainly
been
known
to
appear
spontaneously
to
other
than
professional
mediums
with
this
intent
i
am
acquainted
with
an
old
lady
who
tells
me
that
she
often
talks
with
charles
dickens
napoleon
bonaparte
cardinal
newman
and
other
eminents
i
have
enquired
how
and
she
has
reluctantly
admitted
that
the
spirits
of
these
eminents
come
to
her
at
a
s√©ance
conducted
by
a
professional
medium
who
of
course
is
paid
very
liberally
for
her
services
the
medium
i
gather
sits
behind
a
screen
where
she
is
supposed
to
wait
until
she
is
obsessed
when
everything
is
ready
she
glides
out
and
in
a
voice
purporting
to
be
that
of
napoleon
or
of
someone
equally
distinguished
she
converses
with
this
foolish
and
conceited
old
lady
it
seems
incredible
that
anyone
outside
a
lunatic
asylum
could
believe
that
the
spirits
of
such
great
men
as
napoleon
newman
and
dickens
should
take
the
trouble
to
obsess
a
medium
in
order
to
chat
with
some
nonentity
who
is
neither
extraordinarily
clever
nor
particularly
interesting
and
yet
there
are
dozens
of
people
apart
from
the
old
lady
i
have
mentioned
who
know
so
little
of
genius
and
eminence
and
even
ordinary
talent
as
to
believe
this
incongruous
happening
to
be
possible
i
myself
have
heard
a
spiritualist
who
lays
down
the
laws
respecting
the
unknown
as
if
he
were
actually
the
creator
declare
that
whenever
he
lectures
the
hall
is
full
to
overflowing
with
spirits
amongst
them
he
says
are
the
shades
of
charles
must
be
at
least
a
hundred
shades
of
dickens
for
there
is
hardly
a
spiritualistic
meeting
or
s√©ance
that
i
hear
of
at
which
dickens
is
not
alleged
to
be
isaac
newton
and
napoleon
soon
perhaps
there
will
be
the
kaiser
and
the
crown
prince
i
hope
so
family
s√©ances
are
of
course
quite
another
matter
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
that
when
the
friends
and
relatives
of
some
departed
person
meet
together
and
concentrating
very
earnestly
on
that
dead
one
being
present
create
the
right
magnetic
atmosphere
that
sometimes
a
real
spirit
manifestation
does
take
place
and
the
phantasm
of
the
deceased
or
what
at
any
rate
purports
to
be
the
phantasm
of
the
deceased
does
actually
appear
the
phenomenon
may
possibly
be
a
of
course
there
is
always
that
it
may
really
be
the
soul
spirit
or
whatever
else
we
like
to
call
it
of
the
dead
person
and
here
let
me
urge
again
the
utter
absurdity
of
attempting
to
dogmatise
on
the
unknown
at
one
time
it
was
the
parson
who
unfolded
to
us
with
all
the
sageness
of
one
who
had
been
there
the
mysteries
of
the
other
world
he
not
only
told
us
what
we
must
do
and
not
do
in
order
to
ascend
to
heaven
but
he
went
a
step
further
he
told
us
what
heaven
was
like
and
what
actually
was
taking
place
there
the
parson
of
however
does
not
seem
quite
so
sure
of
his
knowledge
on
these
points
as
he
was
formerly
and
his
statements
have
become
far
less
assertive
indeed
they
have
become
somewhat
tentative
it
is
the
occultist
now
who
dictates
he
talks
with
an
air
of
absolute
authority
of
astral
planes
elementaries
elementals
vitalised
shells
karmas
and
goodness
knows
what
besides
and
uses
such
a
variety
of
terms
that
our
brains
at
last
become
bewildered
and
we
begin
to
wonder
with
goldsmith
how
it
is
possible
that
one
small
head
can
carry
all
he
knows
but
when
we
have
boiled
it
all
down
when
we
have
analysed
his
dissertation
we
find
that
it
is
in
the
last
resort
merely
a
repetition
of
all
the
old
doctrines
with
which
we
have
been
familiar
from
our
earliest
youth
the
only
difference
is
that
our
occultist
chiefly
by
discarding
the
old
names
of
dogmas
and
adopting
a
superfluity
of
new
ones
has
made
of
these
same
doctrines
a
of
such
rare
quality
that
indeed
us
can
digest
it
chapter
xii
a
haunted
mine
in
wales
while
i
was
at
brixton
paying
daily
visits
to
various
theatrical
agencies
in
search
of
work
i
ran
across
the
manager
of
a
company
who
wanted
a
man
of
about
my
age
and
build
to
play
second
lead
in
a
melodrama
i
closed
with
his
offer
and
for
the
next
four
weeks
which
was
as
long
as
his
funds
held
out
i
paid
three
night
visits
to
various
towns
in
wales
winding
up
at
llandudno
no
better
off
financially
than
when
i
commenced
and
having
to
pay
my
own
fare
back
to
london
if
however
my
excursion
into
wales
was
unprofitable
from
the
monetary
standpoint
it
was
by
no
means
lacking
in
other
respects
for
apart
from
the
experience
i
gained
from
playing
four
entirely
different
parts
a
night
with
two
electric
changes
i
came
across
several
interesting
cases
of
hauntings

of
my
landladies
a
kindly
old
soul
to
whom
i
had
chatted
about
ghosts

me
to

morgan
whom
she
said
had
had
a
curious
experience
in
one
of
the
neighbouring
mines
the
incident
had
taken
place
some
fifty
years
ago
shortly
after
a
dreadful
explosion
whereby
many
scores
of
the
miners
had
been
killed
and
injured
i
will
narrate
the
altering
the
wording
of
it
here
and
as
clem
morgan
narrated
it
to
me
a
thousand
feet
down
close
to
the
site
of
a
great
tragedy
that
had
thrilled
the
whole
country
to
the
very
core
my
mate
and
i
were
at
work
pick
pick
pick
shovel
shovel
shovel
the
sound
of
our
instruments
must
have
been
heard
hundreds
of
yards
away
george
i
said
suddenly
leaving
off
work
was
it
like
this
afore
the
accident
like
what
george
grunted
he
was
a
man
with
a
black
stubby
beard
and
arms
like
the
gnarled
and
knotted
branches
of
an
oak
like
what
why
as
lonely
as
this
were
you
working
with
just
one
other
man
or
were
you
with
the
rest
of
the
gang
with
one
other
george
responded
and
just
as
soft
as
you
why
can
t
you
let
the
matter
drop
i
m
sick
to
death
of
hearing
about
it
s
a
marvel
to
me
how
you
escaped
i
went
on
whereabouts
were
you
just
where
we
are
now
george
growled
and
that
s
all
i
ll
tell
you
so
you
d
best
shut
up
and
you
went
up
them
steps
with
all
the
hell
of
the
explosion
ringing
around
you
i
observed
advancing
to
the
edge
of
the
black
shaft
close
to
where
we
were
working
and
looking
at
the
slender
wooden
ladder
leading
up
to
the
dark
vault
above
it
s
a
wonder
to
me
you
didn
t
miss
your
footing
in
your
hurry
and
fall
i
should
have
i
ve
no
doubt
you
would
george
sneered
but
i
m
no
tenderfoot
i
was
at
this
game
when
you
were
in
your
cradle
which
you
never
ought
to
have
how
many
feet
down
is
it
i
went
on
peering
below
me
much
fascinated
fourteen
fathoms
we
don
t
reckon
by
feet
here
done
with
that
way
of
doing
things
in
the
so
that
you
would
be
killed
outright
if
you
fell
try
and
see
george
jeered
it
s
my
brother
i
was
thinking
of
not
myself
i
observed
where
was
he
exactly
when
the
explosion
took
place
how
can
i
say
boy
george
replied
irritably
i
don
t
know
where
half
the
folk
they
told
me
he
was
in
an
adit
leading
into
the
main
he
may
have
been
for
all
i
for
all
i
care
george
answered
gruffly
do
you
suppose
it
was
here
he
was
working
i
said
after
a
moment
or
two
s
pause
during
which
i
again
went
to
the
shaft
and
peered
down
this
is
not
the
only
adit
on
the
main
george
growled
he
wasn
t
not
when
i
i
heard
he
was
with
a
man
he
unintentionally
injured
and
who
ever
after
bore
him
a
oh
oh
george
exclaimed
so
you
know
as
much
as
that
do
you
and
what
pray
was
this
man
like
i
couldn
t
say
i
replied
excepting
that
he
was
much
older
than
dick
and
very
a
description
that
would
fit
in
with
dozens
down
here
if
he
was
working
with
your
brother
and
your
brother
was
killed
the
odds
are
he
was
killed
you
think
so
it
seems
reasonable
enough
don
t
it
george
said
he
might
have
escaped
like
you
he
might
george
laughed
just
in
the
same
way
as
pigs
might
fly
supposing
you
get
on
with
your
work
and
let
me
do
the
i
had
a
queer
dream
about
that
man
i
went
on
dreams
pooh
who
believes
in
dreams
george
said
what
was
it
why
i
dreamed
he
had
something
to
do
with
dick
s
death
and
with
the
you
had
better
tell
the
inspector
george
sneered
and
maybe
he
ll
alter
his
verdict
you
seem
to
have
been
very
fond
of
this
brother
of
yours
you
ve
done
nothing
but
carp
about
him
all
the
i
was
i
replied
so
were
we
all
he
kept
the
home
going
for
the
last
six
kept
the
home
going
why
where
was
you
at
college
studying
for
a
teacher
i
gave
it
up
after
his
a
schoolmaster
well
i
m
blowed
then
you
didn
t
see
much
of
dick
only
in
the
and
who
told
you
about
this
fellow
who
was
supposed
to
have
had
a
spite
against
him
it
was
your
mother
was
it
only
hearsay
evidence
after
all
well
they
re
both
dead
and
bad
and
bad
and
went
a
moment
boy
what
do
they
call
you
well
clem
get
on
with
your
shovelling
for
mercy
s
sake
i
ve
had
enough
of
talking
to
last
me
to
the
end
of
the
i
took
up
my
spade
and
for
the
next
hour
there
were
no
other
sounds
but
the
steady
mechanical
pick
pick
pick
and
scrape
scrape
scrape
every
now
and
then
george
sprang
aside
there
was
a
crash
and
a
huge
block
of
coal
fell
on
the
rocky
floor
mid
a
blinding
shower
of
dust
a
fraction
of
a
second
later
and
george
would
have
been
under
head
a
jelly
yet
the
narrowness
of
his
escape
did
not
seem
to
affect
him
he
treated
it
with
the
utmost
indifference
and
wiping
away
the
smuts
from
his
eyes
took
up
his
pick
and
resumed
his
hitting
i
regarded
him
in
silent
wonder
when
the
arrived
i
groped
my
way
to
one
of
the
big
idea
of
eating
alone
with
george
did
not
appeal
to
an
hour
later
i
set
out
on
my
way
back
a
terrible
sense
of
isolation
hung
over
that
part
of
the
mine
whither
i
bent
my
steps
it
was
so
far
away
from
the
other
tremendously
deep
alarmingly
dark
so
sepulchrally
silent
up
above
in
the
fields
woods
valleys
even
far
away
in
the
primitive
parts
of
the
world
one
is
never
quite
alone
for
the
voice
of
nature
makes
itself
heard
in
the
birds
and
insects
one
knows
one
is
in
the
midst
of
life
but
here
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
encased
in
the
dead
vegetation
of
a
world
there
is
absolute
all
paramount
thousand
times
stiller
than
the
stillness
of
a
closed
sepulchre
as
i
pressed
on
the
crunching
of
my
feet
on
the
scattered
fragments
of
coal
awoke
the
echoes
of
the
galleries
and
i
paused
every
now
and
then
to
listen
in
awe
to
the
long
reverberating
echoes
as
they
rolled
round
and
round
me
once
i
nearly
slipped
another
foot
and
i
would
have
plunged
into
a
sable
labyrinth
the
cold
draught
from
which
wound
itself
round
me
and
choked
the
air
in
my
lungs
i
drew
back
in
horror
and
clinging
to
the
knobbly
surface
of
the
black
wall
by
my
side
pressed
frantically
forward
god
supposing
i
should
ever
lose
my
way
down
left
behind
when
all
the
men
went
would
become
of
me
the
perspiration
rose
on
my
forehead
at
the
bare
idea
of
it
presently
to
my
relief
the
sound
of
picking
fell
on
my
ears
and
an
abrupt
turn
of
the
passage
brought
me
within
sight
of
george
who
had
already
recommenced
work
i
hastened
to
his
side
and
picking
up
my
shovel
began
to
make
a
neat
stack
of
the
rapidly
accumulating
chunks
george
i
said
after
an
emphatic
silence
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
it
was
you
who
was
working
along
with
dick
so
you
ve
been
asking
questions
have
you
george
growled
without
however
showing
the
slightest
inclination
to
leave
off
working
who
told
you
jim
and
harry
well
and
what
of
it
but
why
didn
t
you
say
so
when
i
asked
you
what
odds
if
i
had
it
wouldn
t
have
done
you
any
did
you
have
a
quarrel
with
him
did
the
boys
tell
you
i
had
because
if
so
it
s
no
use
my
saying
but
what
do
you
say
no
dick
and
me
never
had
no
is
that
true
after
this
there
was
another
silence
unbroken
save
by
the
monotonous
handling
of
the
implements
then
i
suddenly
uttered
an
ejaculation
and
pointed
at
my
cap
it
was
lying
on
the
ground
some
few
feet
from
where
we
were
working
close
beneath
a
projecting
block
of
coal
and
it
was
as
if
it
were
being
violently
agitated
by
something
inside
it
what
is
it
i
demanded
what
is
what
george
growled
resting
for
a
moment
on
the
handle
of
his
pick
why
that
i
said
pointing
to
my
cap
what
makes
it
move
like
that
the
wind
of
course
george
said
there
s
not
enough
draught
for
that
see
i
placed
a
piece
of
paper
on
the
ground
within
an
inch
or
two
of
the
cap
and
it
remained
perfectly
still
something
must
be
underneath
i
picked
the
cap
up
there
was
nothing
there
what
do
you
think
of
it
now
i
asked
george
made
no
reply
he
turned
round
so
that
i
could
not
see
his
face
and
plied
his
pick
vigorously
after
a
few
minutes
i
stopped
work
again
george
i
cried
what
s
the
matter
with
your
coat
look
it
s
doing
just
as
your
cap
george
threw
down
his
pick
with
an
oath
what
do
you
want
to
keep
worrying
me
for
he
said
what
s
wrong
now
why
your
coat
look
it
s
up
and
down
as
if
the
wind
were
blowing
there
s
not
an
atom
of
it
s
your
fancy
george
said
hoarsely
the
coat
s
not
what
i
cried
do
you
mean
to
say
you
can
t
see
it
moving
no
george
replied
it
s
not
i
tell
and
picking
up
his
tool
he
set
to
work
again
even
more
vigorously
than
before
some
minutes
later
i
again
stopped
heavens
i
exclaimed
look
at
my
lamp
it
s
burning
blue
what
makes
it
do
that
george
pick
shoulder
looked
round
nonsense
he
said
savagely
you
then
he
left
off
and
his
jaws
dropped
it
must
be
some
chemical
in
it
he
stammered
let
the
damned
thing
be
it
ll
soon
right
this
is
a
strange
place
george
i
said
slowly
why
strange
george
snapped
well
first
of
all
there
was
my
cap
then
your
coat
and
now
the
doing
something
queer
have
you
ever
known
the
likes
of
it
before
often
george
muttered
scores
of
times
funny
things
is
always
happening
below
ground
you
ll
get
used
to
them
in
and
yet
you
look
a
bit
do
i
george
grunted
well
i
m
not
by
i
m
not
you
can
t
always
judge
by
looks
you
and
raising
his
pick
he
attacked
the
coal
furiously
the
afternoon
was
now
waning
outside
away
on
the
top
where
the
only
roof
was
the
heavens
the
sun
had
sunk
to
the
level
of
the
from
whose
straight
and
bodies
the
grotesque
shadows
of
the
night
were
beginning
to
steal
it
is
a
peculiarity
of
the
mines
that
however
deep
down
they
may
be
they
yet
feel
the
influence
of
time
and
the
departure
of
the
sunlight
from
above
creates
an
immediate
increase
in
the
gloom
below
on
this
afternoon
in
particular
i
felt
the
change
acutely
a
darkness
that
did
not
seem
to
be
merely
the
darkness
due
to
time
stole
down
the
pit
s
mouth
and
permeated
adits
shafts
and
everything
my
light
was
still
burning
blue
but
beyond
it
down
in
the
great
gaping
chasm
not
ten
feet
from
him
and
away
along
the
narrow
winding
passage
separating
me
from
the
rest
of
the
gang
all
was
denser
black
than
i
had
conceived
possible
i
was
staring
around
too
fascinated
to
go
on
with
my
work
when
something
icy
cold
gripped
my
fingers
and
looking
down
i
saw
a
big
white
hand
lying
on
the
top
of
mine
i
gave
a
yell
and
dropped
my
the
hand
vanished
what
s
the
matter
now
curse
you
george
said
angrily
if
you
keep
on
hindering
me
like
this
i
ll
tell
the
overseer
see
if
i
don
the
place
is
haunted
i
gasped
a
hand
caught
hold
of
mine
just
a
hand
rot
what
next
and
george
forced
a
laugh
i
m
certain
it
was
a
hand
i
said
and
it
had
a
ring
on
like
my
brother
dick
you
ve
got
dick
on
the
brain
which
is
only
natural
seeing
that
you
was
fond
of
him
and
he
only
just
dead
in
a
few
days
time
you
will
get
over
it
and
laugh
at
your
present
fears
there
s
no
hands
here
but
yours
and
mine
lad
aren
t
there
i
said
quietly
then
what
is
that
just
below
yours
on
the
george
looked
down
instead
of
two
own
two
the
pick
there
were
three
and
the
third
was
white
and
luminous
with
a
shriek
george
dropped
the
pick
and
sprang
away
from
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
serpent
illustration
my
god
there
s
dick
he
s
just
behind
you
do
you
believe
me
now
i
remarked
if
that
wasn
t
dick
s
hand
i
ve
never
seen
it
besides
i
could
swear
to
his
ring
among
a
thousand
have
you
noticed
how
dark
it
has
been
getting
i
ve
noticed
nothing
george
muttered
picking
up
his
tool
it
s
all
your
talk
that
has
done
ve
upset
my
he
raised
his
pick
and
began
to
work
again
but
his
hands
shook
so
much
he
struck
his
leg
and
dropped
the
implement
with
a
cry
of
pain
it
s
nothing
he
growled
as
i
sprang
to
his
side
only
the
skin
grazed
but
i
reckon
i
ll
sit
down
a
m
all
of
a
he
had
moved
nearer
to
the
edge
of
the
pit
and
was
about
to
sit
down
with
his
back
towards
it
when
i
cried
my
god
there
s
dick
he
s
just
behind
you
he
s
pointing
at
you
george
i
see
it
all
now
george
you
murdered
him
george
looked
there
bending
over
him
was
a
tall
figure
with
a
strangely
white
face
he
threw
out
his
hands
to
keep
the
figure
off
and
as
he
did
so
he
slipped
and
fell
with
one
loud
yell
of
terror
into
the
pit
i
heard
him
strike
the
side
of
the
great
abyss
was
all
sick
at
heart
i
reeled
back
to
the
safety
of
the
niche
where
we
had
been
working
and
as
i
did
so
my
eyes
fell
on
the
flame
was
now
white
and
normal
a
rescue
party
that
went
in
search
of
george
found
him
in
a
dying
condition
at
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
the
fact
that
he
was
not
killed
outright
was
due
to
his
having
fallen
in
a
foot
or
two
of
mud
and
water
which
had
somewhat
broken
the
force
of
the
concussion
he
was
fatally
injured
but
he
lingered
just
long
enough
to
confess
that
he
and
he
only
was
to
blame
for
the
recent
disaster
he
had
had
a
violent
quarrel
with
dick
whom
he
had
hated
and
when
dick
s
back
was
turned
he
had
struck
him
over
the
head
with
his
pick
and
killed
him
seized
with
horror
he
then
dragged
dick
s
body
into
the
passage
and
in
order
to
minimise
the
risk
of
discovery
had
saturated
it
with
paraffin
and
set
fire
to
it
he
had
had
just
time
enough
to
reach
the
ladder
leading
up
from
the
shaft
and
climb
up
it
before
the
explosion
had
taken
the
welsh
miners
are
at
times
magnanimous
and
on
this
occasion
they
agreed
to
keep
george
s
crime
a
secret
to
give
publicity
to
the
affair
they
argued
would
not
give
them
back
the
relatives
they
had
lost
and
would
only
do
harm
to
the
dead
man
s
widow
and
family
who
were
left
almost
penniless
thus
the
matter
ended
and
to
the
outside
world
the
cause
of
the
explosion
remained
as
before
a
mystery
of
course
it
may
be
said
of
this
case
that
it
has
no
great
value
from
the
evidental
point
of
view
no
one
having
witnessed
the
ghostly
happening
but
morgan
and
the
man
who
was
subsequently
killed
this
may
be
at
the
same
time
much
depends
upon
the
character
of
a
witness
and
the
evidence
of
one
man
who
is
reliable
is
surely
worth
more
than
the
evidence
of
several
men
who
are
not
reliable
morgan
told
his
story
in
a
simple
straightforward
manner
and
i
believed
him
chapter
xiii
the
pool
in
wales
that
lures
people
to
death
i
think
there
is
very
little
doubt
that
two
of
the
mediums
through
which
the
occult
forces
get
at
humanity
are
colour
and
locality
red
for
example
being
the
colour
of
blood
is
made
the
medium
for
instilling
thoughts
of
murder
green
in
a
similar
manner
is
used
to
suggest
suicide
by
drowning
yellow
suggests
madness
of
the
most
alluring
and
attractive
nature
and
so
on
until
by
a
careful
study
of
human
crimes
in
their
relation
to
colour
one
might
tabulate
a
complete
list
and
so
with
localities
certain
spots
attract
certain
types
of
spirits
and
these
in
turn
suggest
certain
thoughts
some
beautiful
and
some
the
reverse
i
was
still
in
north
wales
when
a
week
or
so
before
the
expiration
of
the
tour
i
did
a
day
s
tramping
on
the
hills
and
being
caught
in
a
heavy
i
had
to
take
shelter
under
one
of
those
low
stone
walls
with
which
the
whole
is
intersected
the
afternoon
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
the
fading
light
made
me
a
bit
anxious
as
to
how
i
should
find
my
way
back
to
my
lodgings
as
i
was
crouching
there
praying
to
heaven
that
the
storm
would
soon
cease
so
that
i
could
continue
my
way
i
suddenly
heard
a
loud
cry
as
of
someone
in
distress
and
on
its
being
repeated
i
scrambled
up
and
hastened
in
the
direction
of
the
sounds
about
a
hundred
yards
further
on
there
was
a
break
in
the
wall
and
i
caught
the
glimmer
of
water
it
was
one
of
those
roadside
pools
not
uncommon
in
wales
and
usually
of
great
depth
as
i
drew
nearer
i
saw
it
was
fringed
on
the
far
side
by
a
cluster
of
tall
pines
that
creaked
and
groaned
dismally
as
the
strong
west
wind
drove
volumes
of
water
through
their
bowed
branches
i
was
noticing
all
this
when
the
form
of
a
man
in
a
mackintosh
rose
from
the
gorze
close
by
my
side
and
thrusting
his
head
forward
so
that
i
could
not
see
his
face
walked
with
great
swinging
strides
towards
the
pool
i
thought
this
rather
queer
but
i
thought
it
still
queerer
when
the
cries
i
had
heard
before
broke
out
again
with
increased
violence
unmistakably
this
time
from
the
trees
and
the
man
breaking
into
a
run
rushed
up
to
the
margin
of
the
pool
where
he
abruptly
disappeared
i
was
close
behind
him
at
the
time
and
am
positive
he
did
not
enter
the
water
his
whole
body
seemed
to
melt
away
as
he
stood
on
the
bank
what
became
of
him
i
could
not
say
i
only
know
he
vanished
the
incident
so
unnerved
me
that
it
was
only
with
a
considerable
effort
of
mind
i
went
on
i
threaded
my
way
through
the
trees
and
looked
everywhere
but
there
was
no
one
about
and
nothing
whatever
as
far
as
i
could
see
to
account
for
the
sounds
i
looked
at
the
water
it
was
inky
black
and
there
was
something
sinister
about
it
something
that
strangely
suggested
to
me
that
away
down
in
its
cold
still
depths
was
peculiar
venomous
repellant
living
thing
that
was
watching
me
and
longing
to
entwine
its
arms
round
me
and
drag
me
ruthlessly
down
i
was
appalled
the
apparent
loneliness
of
the
spot
was
frightful
and
as
i
tore
myself
away
and
renewed
my
journey
home
i
fancied
i
heard
in
which
all
the
trees
seemed
to
join
in
chorus
on
arriving
at
my
rooms
i
enquired
about
the
pool
and
my
landlady
informed
me
it
bore
a
very
evil
reputation
several
people
had
been
found
drowned
there
and
no
one
would
go
near
it
after
dark
this
stimulated
me
to
make
further
enquiries
i
came
across
one
or
two
men
who
testified
to
having
heard
cries
there
and
one
old
woman
who
declared
she
had
seen
a
curious
figure
half
human
and
half
animal
vanish
in
the
pine
trees
but
i
could
get
nothing
in
the
way
of
details
for
some
months
not
until
i
had
returned
to
london
when
quite
by
chance
and
under
rather
extraordinary
circumstances
i
was
introduced
to
a
man
long
since
dead
who
many
years
before
had
had
a
somewhat
harrowing
experience
there
the
gist
of
what
he
narrated
to
me
was
as
follows
philip
delaney
was
a
member
of
the
london
stock
exchange
and
at
one
august
evening
was
sitting
before
the
empty
grate
in
his
study
smoking
though
not
naturally
a
pessimist
his
thoughts
were
at
that
moment
excessively
gloomy
business
during
the
past
few
years
had
been
steadily
getting
worse
and
worse
and
it
now
seemed
as
if
the
day
of
general
stagnation
must
be
very
near
at
hand
from
an
average
of
fifteen
hundred
a
year
his
income
had
fallen
to
less
than
eight
hundred
consequently
he
could
not
as
usual
take
his
holiday
abroad
he
could
only
just
afford
to
send
his
wife
and
children
to
hastings
where
he
might
possibly
be
able
to
join
them
for
as
a
fitting
accompaniment
to
his
thoughts
the
weather
was
vile
cold
and
wet
he
could
hear
the
raindrops
beating
against
the
glass
and
falling
on
the
with
an
incessant
wearying
and
worrying
patter
he
was
too
depressed
to
read
it
was
too
early
to
sleep
he
could
only
sit
and
think
everlastingly
think
indeed
he
was
deeply
engaged
in
in
which
two
and
two
and
a
half
percentages
were
hearing
someone
cough
he
turned
sharply
round
no
one
was
there
this
was
odd
he
could
have
sworn
the
sound
came
from
just
behind
him
with
his
eyes
focussed
on
the
door
he
listened
the
cough
was
repeated
footsteps
accompanied
it
and
from
out
of
the
wall
stepped
the
figure
of
a
man
philip
delaney
gasped
in
astonishment
he
recognised
the
figure
at
once
it
was
markham
davidson
a
very
old
friend
of
his
the
author
of
several
works
on
metaphysics
and
psychology
there
was
nothing
peculiar
about
complexion
expression
clothes
and
walk
were
all
perfectly
natural
they
belonged
to
the
markham
davidson
he
knew
but
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
ages
and
yet
how
if
he
were
flesh
and
blood
had
he
passed
through
several
inches
of
solid
brick
and
mortar
how
unquestionably
he
could
not
have
done
so
unless
he
had
suddenly
acquired
superphysical
properties
and
projected
his
immaterial
body
after
the
manner
of
one
of
the
phantasms
about
which
he
was
so
fond
of
writing
walking
across
the
room
with
a
quick
tread
the
figure
displayed
certain
forward
poke
of
the
head
a
prematurely
old
stoop
of
the
shoulders
and
a
bend
of
the
those
of
davidson
delaney
noted
too
that
markham
looked
remarkably
cheeks
were
ruddy
and
full
his
eyes
were
bright
his
movements
full
of
energy
in
one
hand
he
carried
a
stamped
envelope
and
in
the
other
an
umbrella
with
which
he
tapped
the
ground
vigorously
as
he
walked
he
moved
in
a
straight
line
without
looking
to
the
right
or
left
and
stepping
into
the
wall
a
few
feet
from
the
window
disappeared
before
delaney
could
utter
a
sound
as
the
whole
occurrence
had
occupied
so
short
a
space
of
or
four
seconds
at
the
tried
hard
to
persuade
himself
that
the
phenomena
was
an
hallucination
but
try
as
he
would
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
what
he
had
seen
was
entirely
subjective
there
on
the
wall
was
the
very
spot
where
the
figure
had
emerged
and
there
exactly
opposite
the
very
spot
through
which
it
had
vanished
no
hallucination
he
argued
could
have
been
so
vivid
nor
could
it
have
embraced
so
many
graphic
and
minute
details
details
yes
crowds
of
details
he
remembered
them
all
distinctly
especially
the
tie
there
was
a
redness
about
very
peculiar
redness
he
did
not
recollect
seeing
in
any
other
tie
it
impressed
him
greatly
and
he
could
not
eradicate
it
from
his
mind
he
noticed
the
envelope
too
not
so
much
because
it
was
addressed
to
delaney
as
because
it
was
white
startlingly
white
whilst
the
stamp
was
the
same
very
pronounced
red
as
the
tie
long
after
the
figure
had
gone
philip
pondered
over
these
idiosyncrasies
and
the
more
he
thought
of
them
the
more
perplexed
he
grew
what
he
had
seen
was
without
doubt
the
phantasm
of
markham
the
living
markham
davidson
identical
with
his
old
friend
markham
davidson
in
all
but
the
colour
of
the
tie
red
what
one
earth
could
have
possessed
davidson
to
wear
such
a
colour
he
pondered
over
this
as
deeply
as
though
it
had
been
one
of
the
most
weighty
problems
of
the
stock
exchange
and
when
he
went
to
bed
that
night
and
looked
in
his
mirror
he
saw
instead
of
his
own
tie
a
one
his
dreams
took
disturbing
forms
three
times
following
he
saw
markham
davidson
struggling
for
dear
life
in
a
dreary
looking
pool
situated
by
the
side
of
a
very
lonely
mountain
road
and
overshadowed
by
tall
pines
that
creaked
and
groaned
like
lost
souls
every
time
the
wind
smote
them
with
such
perspicuity
were
the
details
in
these
dreams
stamped
on
his
mind
that
each
time
he
awoke
he
saw
them
again
there
they
were
everywhere
he
glimmering
white
road
with
the
wide
expanse
of
snow
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
the
long
line
of
low
stone
wall
beyond
which
lay
darkness
and
the
pool
heavens
what
a
pool
it
black
unfathomably
deep
and
hideously
suggestive
of
an
antagonistic
insatiable
something
that
lay
crouching
in
its
bosom
ever
on
the
for
prey
delaney
was
fascinated
although
he
realised
that
the
very
atmosphere
of
the
place
was
intensely
evil
that
it
had
a
wholly
demoralising
effect
and
contaminated
everybody
and
everything
that
came
near
it
although
absolutely
he
understood
all
this
yet
he
allowed
himself
to
be
drawn
unresistingly
towards
it
when
he
awoke
from
one
vision
of
it
he
craved
heaven
and
hell
to
permit
him
to
see
another
and
in
this
manner
he
passed
the
whole
night
on
coming
down
to
breakfast
the
first
thing
that
arrested
his
attention
was
an
envelope
addressed
to
him
in
the
writing
of
markham
davidson
he
tore
it
open
and
with
breathless
excitement
read
as
follows
dear
phil
is
a
very
long
time
since
i
heard
from
you
an
irresistible
craze
has
just
come
over
me
to
go
to
north
wales
strange
because
as
i
daresay
you
remember
i
have
always
detested
wales
now
however
i
am
eaten
up
with
a
mad
desire
to
go
to
llanginney
an
spot
somewhere
near
cader
idris
i
never
heard
of
it
till
yesterday
when
it
suddenly
attracted
my
attention
as
i
was
gazing
at
an
atlas
will
you
join
me
there
for
a
day
or
two
i
go
wednesday
and
intend
staying
a
week
it
would
be
very
pleasant
once
again
to
tramp
the
with
you
delaney
looked
at
the
postmark
it
was
stamped
could
davidson
have
been
on
the
way
to
the
when
he
delaney
had
seen
his
phantasm
if
that
were
so
then
undoubtedly
it
was
a
case
of
unconscious
projection
markham
whilst
thinking
of
him
delaney
in
connection
with
the
invitation
to
llanginney
had
unconsciously
separated
his
immaterial
from
his
material
body
and
projected
it
delaney
had
read
one
or
two
works
on
psychic
phenomena
and
understood
from
them
that
spirit
projection
was
not
only
quite
feasible
but
far
from
uncommon
however
he
could
not
accept
davidson
s
invitation
he
had
not
the
money
go
to
llanginney
indeed
why
davidson
might
as
well
have
asked
him
to
travel
to
petrograd
and
pool
that
white
road
those
shaking
that
lurking
invisible
something
could
he
resist
for
a
solid
hour
he
battled
with
himself
battled
till
the
sweat
rose
to
his
brow
and
poured
down
his
throat
and
chest
then
he
decided
to
join
davidson
was
utterly
out
of
the
question
he
had
neither
the
time
money
nor
inclination
like
the
majority
of
writers
davidson
was
a
creature
of
and
irresponsible
he
philip
delaney
was
different
he
was
a
materialist
wholly
practical
and
he
never
acted
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
never
chased
wild
geese
in
a
very
superior
frame
of
mind
he
sat
down
and
wrote
to
davidson
expressing
his
extreme
regret
at
not
being
able
to
accept
his
invitation
then
he
got
up
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
and
clapping
on
his
hat
went
off
to
business
all
that
day
however
whilst
he
was
brooding
over
figures
in
his
office
and
listening
to
the
ceaseless
babble
at
the
change
his
mind
reverted
to
the
pool
it
was
that
black
piece
of
water
always
that
water
and
davidson
in
his
red
tie
always
that
particular
red
tie
struggling
in
it
at
last
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
felt
that
even
if
he
had
to
sell
his
wife
and
house
and
children
he
must
yield
to
this
damnable
go
darting
out
of
his
office
shortly
after
luncheon
he
hurried
to
the
railway
station
and
took
the
first
train
home
in
less
than
half
an
hour
he
had
made
all
the
necessary
arrangements
for
a
brief
absence
packed
his
valise
and
secured
a
hansom
all
this
happened
long
before
the
advent
of
taxis
the
train
was
an
express
to
chester
but
the
rest
of
the
journey
was
slow
and
it
was
nine
o
clock
before
he
found
himself
on
the
single
platform
of
llangelly
the
nearest
station
to
llanginney
delaney
enquired
as
to
how
he
was
to
reach
his
destination
and
was
informed
by
the
solitary
porter
that
if
he
wished
to
get
there
he
must
walk
there
ain
t
no
vehicles
for
hire
in
this
part
of
the
country
the
porter
said
everyone
that
comes
here
has
to
use
their
feet
you
can
t
mistake
the
road
you
ve
only
to
keep
straight
you
are
bound
to
arrive
delaney
smiled
grimly
he
felt
as
little
like
walking
as
he
had
ever
done
in
his
life
and
besides
his
gladstone
he
had
a
raincoat
and
umbrella
fortunately
the
night
was
fine
and
ere
he
had
covered
his
first
the
moon
broke
out
from
behind
a
cloud
and
illuminated
the
entire
landscape
for
the
next
mile
or
two
the
road
was
fairly
flat
and
then
it
gradually
began
to
rise
the
scenery
becoming
wilder
and
wilder
every
now
and
then
he
paused
and
throwing
back
his
head
drank
in
deep
breaths
of
the
air
delicious
what
a
change
from
london
he
calculated
he
must
have
done
about
of
the
distance
when
he
arrived
at
a
entrance
to
a
lane
that
at
once
made
him
shudder
he
paused
opposite
the
turning
and
tried
to
find
some
explanation
for
his
fear
it
was
certainly
very
lonely
and
the
white
patches
of
moonlight
on
the
footpath
and
hedgerows
suggested
much
but
after
all
it
was
only
which
a
few
sunbeams
would
at
once
dissipate
he
was
standing
within
the
shadow
of
a
clump
of
firs
facing
the
lane
and
looking
intently
ahead
of
him
when
at
a
distance
of
some
fifty
or
so
yards
the
figure
of
a
man
in
a
mackintosh
slowly
emerged
from
a
gap
in
the
hedge
the
man
merely
glanced
in
delaney
s
direction
and
then
turning
round
moved
on
down
the
lane
but
the
glimpse
momentary
though
it
had
been
was
sufficient
to
enable
delaney
to
identify
the
person
it
was
davidson
he
knew
him
at
once
by
his
mannerisms
and
he
instinctively
felt
he
had
on
that
flagrantly
vulgar
tie
in
an
instant
he
formed
a
resolution
he
would
give
his
friend
a
surprise
with
this
intention
in
view
he
dropped
his
valise
and
stepping
noiselessly
forward
he
followed
davidson
on
and
on
they
went
the
one
keeping
fifty
or
so
yards
behind
the
other
till
there
came
a
sudden
bend
in
the
lane
and
then
delaney
received
a
shock
spread
out
before
him
exactly
as
he
had
seen
it
in
his
dreams
was
the
panorama
of
the
white
glimmering
road
with
the
wide
wild
expanse
of
moorland
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
the
long
line
of
wall
pool
nothing
could
have
been
more
like
and
it
was
intensified
by
the
brilliancy
of
the
moonbeams
crouching
in
the
heather
delaney
watched
davidson
slowly
walk
up
to
the
edge
of
the
water
fold
his
arms
and
gaze
in
a
reflective
manner
into
the
shadowy
depths
the
moments
flew
by
and
still
he
gazed
then
there
came
a
brief
distracting
interval
during
which
the
moon
disappeared
behind
a
bank
of
black
funereal
clouds
when
it
emerged
the
figure
of
davidson
had
vanished
and
delaney
occupied
the
spot
where
he
had
stood
the
pool
the
greedy
insatiable
pool
he
muttered
dark
deep
and
devilish
the
three
d
s
i
might
even
add
a
and
turning
round
with
a
chuckle
he
was
preparing
to
go
when
someone
vaulted
the
stone
wall
to
his
left
and
rapidly
approached
him
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
are
still
pottering
about
here
the
stranger
a
man
about
delaney
s
own
height
and
build
panted
i
thought
you
had
returned
to
the
inn
long
then
perceiving
his
mistake
he
said
in
amazement
why
it
s
someone
else
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
quite
thought
you
were
an
acquaintance
of
davidson
by
any
chance
delaney
asked
pleasantly
yes
markham
davidson
the
stranger
said
in
astonishment
do
you
know
him
too
i
am
his
old
friend
delaney
laughed
and
i
am
on
my
way
to
join
him
at
llanginney
i
merely
stopped
here
to
look
at
the
the
pool
the
stranger
ejaculated
eyeing
him
curiously
it
is
not
the
pleasantest
place
in
the
world
is
it
no
delaney
replied
but
it
has
its
fascination
where
did
you
leave
davidson
at
the
entrance
to
this
lane
half
an
hour
ago
the
stranger
answered
scanning
the
dark
surface
of
the
water
anxiously
i
wanted
to
get
as
far
as
the
brow
of
the
hill
over
yonder
but
as
davidson
complained
of
feeling
tired
i
set
out
alone
he
said
he
would
follow
me
slowly
and
wait
for
me
somewhere
about
here
did
you
by
any
chance
hear
a
cry
a
cry
delaney
exclaimed
a
cry
no
did
you
i
thought
i
did
the
stranger
said
moving
away
from
the
edge
of
the
water
that
is
why
i
hurried
here
perhaps
he
is
somewhere
about
supposing
we
they
shouted
till
they
were
hoarse
and
the
great
hills
opposite
hurled
back
the
echoes
of
their
voices
but
there
was
no
other
reply
not
a
sign
of
davidson
at
last
the
stranger
touched
delaney
on
the
arm
come
he
said
with
a
shiver
the
night
air
is
cold
davidson
must
have
gone
back
to
the
inn
and
unless
we
make
haste
we
shall
be
locked
out
they
go
to
bed
at
very
reluctantly
delaney
gave
up
the
search
and
the
men
were
soon
tramping
along
the
road
in
apparently
too
with
their
own
thoughts
to
speak
occasionally
delaney
glanced
covertly
at
his
companion
and
whenever
he
did
so
he
surprised
the
latter
in
the
act
of
peeping
cautiously
at
him
eventually
the
lights
of
llanginney
hove
in
view
and
several
of
the
other
visitors
at
the
inn
strolled
out
to
meet
them
no
davidson
has
not
returned
was
the
reply
to
their
enquiries
we
have
seen
nothing
of
him
since
you
left
it
s
not
eleven
yet
however
he
has
still
half
an
hour
and
on
such
a
night
as
this
it
would
be
practically
impossible
to
lose
one
s
delaney
engaged
his
bed
and
half
an
hour
later
as
davidson
had
not
yet
come
back
he
made
his
way
to
the
landlord
s
private
parlour
on
the
threshold
he
met
his
recent
companion
who
is
he
he
enquired
of
the
landlord
directly
the
door
was
closed
and
he
heard
the
stranger
s
footsteps
echoing
softly
down
the
passage
who
is
he
the
landlord
sleepily
exclaimed
why
hartney
a
london
lawyer
quite
a
man
in
town
so
i
m
told
no
he
has
never
been
here
before
and
as
far
as
i
m
aware
he
had
never
met
davidson
till
will
i
send
someone
to
look
for
davidson
why
that
is
what
hartney
has
just
asked
me
no
sir
i
have
no
one
to
send
and
he
spoke
somewhat
testily
some
of
my
men
have
who
sleep
out
and
the
rest
are
in
bed
i
shall
leave
the
door
open
we
aren
t
afraid
of
burglars
in
this
part
of
the
country
no
as
i
told
hartney
there
is
no
fear
of
the
gentleman
being
has
gone
a
little
further
than
he
intended
that
is
and
the
landlord
yawned
so
emphatically
that
delaney
beat
a
hasty
retreat
i
m
going
to
bed
he
said
as
he
passed
hartney
in
the
hall
the
landlord
assures
me
there
is
no
fear
of
any
harm
having
befallen
davidson
and
that
he
is
sure
to
turn
up
all
do
you
think
so
the
lawyer
queried
delaney
nodded
i
know
davidson
he
said
i
have
known
him
since
boyhood
he
is
the
least
likely
person
in
the
world
to
meet
with
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
hartney
responded
very
glad
i
fancied
there
it
must
have
only
been
fancy
being
intimately
acquainted
with
davidson
you
would
of
course
know
his
voice
and
had
he
really
called
out
you
would
certainly
have
heard
him
it
is
doubtless
a
mere
fancy
on
my
part
as
delaney
wearily
climbed
the
staircase
and
peeped
through
the
bannister
his
eyes
encountered
those
of
the
lawyer
steadily
following
him
he
lost
no
time
in
undressing
but
when
he
got
into
bed
he
found
sleep
would
not
come
to
him
he
lay
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
he
tried
not
to
think
he
resorted
to
every
possible
device
but
it
was
all
of
no
avail
it
was
the
pool
always
the
pool
the
pool
and
the
tie
he
kept
seeing
them
before
him
and
they
continually
bade
him
get
out
of
bed
and
come
to
them
at
last
unable
to
resist
them
any
longer
he
got
up
and
after
slipping
on
his
clothes
stole
noiselessly
out
into
the
still
and
narrow
country
road
when
he
had
gone
a
few
yards
he
thought
he
heard
a
door
shut
behind
him
but
on
turning
round
and
perceiving
no
one
he
attributed
it
to
fancy
and
went
ahead
at
a
brisk
pace
at
last
to
his
relief
the
pool
came
in
view
there
it
was
just
as
he
had
seen
it
and
silent
with
the
huge
firs
shaking
their
heads
ominously
on
the
far
side
of
it
and
the
long
line
of
glittering
white
wall
casting
its
black
shadow
on
the
grass
and
gorse
running
away
from
it
in
an
apparently
interminable
line
on
the
side
nearest
him
it
was
a
sight
he
knew
he
would
never
forget
as
long
as
he
lived
approaching
the
brink
of
the
pool
he
walked
slowly
round
it
peering
anxiously
into
the
water
suddenly
he
gave
a
start
something
white
abruptly
bobbed
to
the
surface
he
looked
closely
at
it
and
fancied
he
discerned
a
face
he
was
about
to
attach
a
name
to
it
when
he
heard
something
behind
him
swinging
sharply
round
he
confronted
hartney
good
heavens
you
here
he
exclaimed
whatever
brought
you
out
at
this
time
of
night
i
might
say
the
same
to
you
the
lawyer
replied
what
brought
you
here
davidson
delaney
said
do
you
know
i
can
t
help
associating
him
with
this
pool
it
is
damnably
i
can
t
help
associating
him
with
that
cry
hartney
remarked
i
am
certain
it
was
his
voice
good
god
what
s
that
and
he
pointed
frantically
at
the
white
thing
bobbing
up
and
down
in
the
water
just
where
the
moonbeams
fell
thickest
and
not
half
a
dozen
yards
from
where
they
stood
where
delaney
said
pressing
close
to
him
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
where
ah
i
see
it
now
it
s
looking
towards
us
if
you
wish
to
know
what
it
he
left
off
abruptly
there
was
a
wild
scream
a
heavy
splash
and
he
continued
his
sentence
that
hartney
is
the
solution
you
seek
to
the
and
he
went
back
to
the
inn
alone
chuckling
the
sequel
to
this
narrative
comes
as
a
surprise
hartney
was
not
drowned
being
a
very
powerful
swimmer
and
lightly
clad
he
got
to
the
other
side
of
the
pool
and
clambering
up
the
bank
he
wrung
the
water
from
his
clothes
and
ran
all
the
way
to
the
inn
on
arriving
there
to
his
intense
astonishment
he
found
davidson
safe
and
sound
and
dressed
in
clothes
two
or
three
sizes
too
small
for
him
davidson
s
experience
had
been
very
similar
to
his
own
delaney
had
suddenly
seized
him
round
the
waist
and
hurled
him
into
the
middle
of
the
pool
there
he
declared
he
felt
something
like
very
big
and
icy
cold
hands
trying
to
pull
him
down
he
cried
for
help
and
prayed
and
as
he
prayed
the
hands
relaxed
their
grasp
and
he
managed
to
struggle
safely
to
shore
the
shock
of
what
he
had
gone
through
however
was
so
great
that
he
felt
too
ill
to
get
back
to
the
inn
and
he
was
compelled
to
rest
awhile
at
a
farm
where
he
obtained
a
hot
bath
and
a
suit
of
clothes
as
davidson
knew
delaney
s
wife
and
family
he
begged
hartney
for
their
sake
to
keep
the
affair
as
secret
as
possible
the
doctor
who
was
called
in
to
examine
delaney
could
not
certify
him
as
being
actually
insane
however
he
strongly
recommended
him
to
go
into
a
private
home
for
a
time
where
he
would
be
kept
under
constant
supervision
and
delaney
did
as
the
doctor
advised
but
after
being
in
the
home
about
a
month
he
escaped
and
was
eventually
found
drowned
in
the
lonely
pool
near
llanginney
from
the
description
given
me
of
delaney
i
am
under
the
impression
that
the
figure
i
saw
in
the
mackintosh
was
his
ghost
but
what
about
the
figure
hartney
was
positive
he
saw
floating
in
the
water
was
it
the
phantom
of
someone
who
had
perished
there
or
had
davidson
again
unconsciously
projected
himself
i
incline
to
the
latter
this
is
the
case
in
toto
and
it
was
told
to
me
by
hartney
who
got
all
the
details
apart
from
those
he
had
himself
experienced
direct
from
davidson
and
chapter
xiv
i
go
on
with
the
history
of
my
life
and
narrate
a
ghostly
happening
in
liverpool
i
gave
up
acting
directly
i
became
engaged
to
be
married
i
had
no
alternative
as
my
fianc√©e
s
parents
strongly
disapproved
of
the
stage
and
so
long
as
i
was
on
it
they
would
i
knew
never
consent
to
my
union
with
their
daughter
but
it
was
rather
a
wrench
for
i
really
liked
acting
and
with
the
exception
of
the
sunday
travelling
the
life
suited
me
well
what
other
occupation
to
choose
was
a
poser
all
the
difficulties
that
had
faced
me
on
my
return
from
the
states
once
again
presented
themselves
and
were
aggravated
by
the
fact
that
i
was
many
years
older
i
was
racking
my
brain
to
know
what
to
do
for
the
best
when
i
received
a
letter
from
an
old
friend
in
cornwall
who
suggested
that
i
should
go
down
there
and
open
up
a
small
preparatory
boys
school
it
was
hobson
s
choice
and
in
due
course
of
time
i
found
myself
once
again
engaged
in
the
profession
i
loathed
i
started
with
four
or
five
pupils
and
had
worked
up
my
connection
till
i
had
nearly
thirty
when
someone
with
more
money
than
i
set
up
on
a
much
bigger
scale
and
my
numbers
gradually
decreased
i
was
never
an
orthodox
pedagogue
very
much
the
reverse
i
aimed
rather
at
making
my
pupils
manly
than
at
cramming
their
heads
with
book
work
and
i
think
i
succeeded
there
were
exceptions
of
course
but
my
pupils
as
a
whole
developed
a
fondness
for
games
both
cricket
and
football
that
bore
subsequent
fruit
when
they
left
me
and
went
on
the
public
schools
the
occupation
that
formed
part
of
my
life
now
was
delightful
but
the
dry
and
dull
monotony
of
the
schoolroom
and
the
eternal
interference
of
certain
of
the
parents
of
my
pupils
who
wanted
everything
for
nothing
for
my
fees
were
ridiculously
small
took
it
out
of
me
so
much
that
i
simply
longed
to
throw
up
the
whole
thing
and
get
back
to
my
stage
or
writing
it
was
while
i
was
in
cornwall
that
i
got
my
first
book
for
satan
s
sake
taken
ranger
gull
who
was
at
that
time
reader
for
arthur
greening
s
publishing
house
read
the
and
was
so
pleased
with
it
that
he
recommended
it
strongly
for
publication
it
was
accepted
but
did
not
appear
in
print
for
fully
a
year
the
unknown
depths
which
i
had
written
in
james
road
brixton
followed
then
jennie
barlowe
which
i
wrote
between
school
hours
in
cornwall
in
the
spring
of
then
dinevah
the
beautiful
the
last
of
my
efforts
in
brixton
the
latter
appeared
in
in
the
winter
of
my
wife
was
ill
and
in
the
evenings
when
my
harassing
duties
in
the
schoolroom
were
over
i
used
to
sit
by
her
bedside
evolving
fresh
plots
it
was
then
that
i
first
conceived
the
idea
of
writing
a
ghost
book
in
my
holidays
which
i
usually
spent
in
london
or
the
midlands
never
in
always
flew
away
from
the
precincts
of
the
schoolroom
the
moment
we
broke
had
often
gone
and
i
now
determined
to
make
use
of
my
experiences
consequently
i
mapped
out
a
synopsis
of
a
work
on
haunted
houses
which
was
at
once
accepted
by
eveleigh
nash
who
commissioned
me
to
write
a
book
on
those
lines
i
did
this
in
the
summer
of
and
the
book
which
appeared
in
the
autumn
of
that
year
and
was
entitled
some
haunted
houses
of
england
and
wales
created
something
of
a
sensation
it
was
not
only
extensively
reviewed
by
the
london
papers
but
by
many
of
the
american
and
colonial
ones
as
well
from
that
time
onward
my
pen
has
rarely
been
idle
and
apart
from
compiling
some
dozen
or
so
works
on
the
superphysical
i
have
written
innumerable
short
stories
and
articles
indeed
so
associated
has
my
name
become
with
everything
appertaining
to
the
psychic
that
publishers
are
inclined
to
the
idea
that
i
can
not
write
upon
any
other
subject
in
this
however
i
venture
to
think
they
are
mistaken
for
my
two
works
the
reminiscences
of
ward
and
the
irish
abroad
both
published
by
sir
isaac
pitman
have
been
very
favourably
received
by
both
the
press
and
public
it
was
however
the
success
of
this
first
work
of
mine
on
ghostly
phenomena
that
made
me
realise
that
what
i
had
long
hoped
for
had
at
last
come
within
measurable
distance
of
attainment
i
could
give
up
teaching
and
devote
my
time
once
again
wholly
and
solely
to
writing
never
shall
i
forget
with
what
what
unbounded
and
infinite
hailed
the
prospect
of
leaving
for
ever
behind
me
all
those
weary
dreary
hours
in
the
schoolroom
where
i
had
been
forced
to
display
a
patience
i
never
had
and
where
i
had
been
forced
to
assume
a
virtue
i
never
really
possessed
namely
a
love
of
teaching
i
made
public
my
intention
of
giving
up
the
school
in
the
summer
of
and
the
following
winter
saw
me
snugly
ensconced
in
a
little
house
in
upper
norwood
where
i
have
been
ever
since
several
writers
one
of
whom
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
in
london
quite
recently
his
brilliant
character
studies
of
young
and
charming
girls
figure
monthly
in
certain
of
the
popular
magazines
have
been
credited
with
introducing
to
the
public
none
too
favourably
this
cornish
colony
amongst
whom
i
lived
if
they
have
done
so
i
can
certainly
endorse
their
sentiments
in
no
other
town
that
i
have
been
in
have
i
ever
met
people
who
laid
themselves
open
to
such
unfavourable
criticism
i
lived
there
nearly
eight
years
and
during
that
time
i
received
the
bare
minimum
of
hospitality
i
found
the
greater
number
of
the
inhabitants
bigoted
and
pharisaical
and
the
townfolk
and
labouring
people
not
only
extremely
ignorant
but
very
unforgiving
and
vindictive
that
they
were
is
to
say
at
the
time
i
am
writing
a
tribal
state
was
proved
by
their
puerile
attitude
of
hostility
to
strangers
whom
they
used
frequently
to
insult
and
annoy
i
signed
two
petitions
relative
to
the
throwing
of
stones
at
visitors
which
petitions
were
forwarded
to
the
home
secretary
the
result
was
nil
the
local
authorities
in
dealing
with
such
cases
displayed
the
most
woeful
apathy
and
apparently
this
state
of
affairs
was
irremediable
since
the
magistrates
with
few
exceptions
were
related
to
half
the
people
in
the
town
with
the
art
colony
i
had
very
little
to
do
the
few
artists
i
knew
at
all
intimately
i
liked
i
found
them
congenial
and
generally
sympathetic
though
displaying
an
avidity
in
criticising
authors
which
considering
their
touchiness
with
regard
to
any
criticism
of
their
own
work
was
distinctly
amusing
all
the
same
apart
from
this
and
one
other
harmless
peculiarity
namely
an
exaggerated
and
unblushing
deference
to
titles
i
found
them
very
good
fellows
and
nearly
all
the
hospitality
i
received
in
the
town
i
received
from
them
i
think
i
am
right
in
saying
there
was
never
a
very
friendly
feeling
between
the
townspeople
and
the
artists
the
townspeople
looked
upon
the
artists
as
intruders
foreigners
whose
ways
and
habits
were
diametrically
opposite
to
theirs
especially
with
regard
to
the
treatment
of
the
sabbath
whilst
the
artists
showed
a
none
too
well
concealed
contempt
for
the
townspeople
whom
they
seemed
to
regard
not
only
as
hopelessly
inartistic
but
of
an
utterly
inferior
breed
in
most
small
towns
there
is
a
good
deal
of
unkind
gossip
and
scandal
but
i
really
think
that
in
this
respect
the
town
i
refer
to
was
unrivalled
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
people
were
never
so
happy
as
when
saying
malicious
things
about
each
other
and
they
meanly
victimised
those
whose
limited
means
would
not
permit
of
their
taking
legal
action
against
them
i
have
often
wondered
what
made
these
people
so
peculiarly
unkind
as
soon
as
i
had
settled
down
in
norwood
i
wrote
ghostly
phenomena
which
was
reviewed
at
length
by
andrew
lang
in
the
morning
about
that
time
i
had
the
great
pleasure
of
meeting
ward
the
rencontre
happened
thus
the
misses
enid
and
beatrice
ward
ward
s
youngest
daughters
were
getting
up
some
theatricals
and
being
short
of
a
man
asked
a
lady
with
whom
i
was
acquainted
if
she
knew
of
anyone
who
would
help
them
out
of
the
difficulty
she
wrote
to
me
with
the
result
that
i
took
part
in
the
play
and
thus
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
the
wards
with
whom
i
am
happy
to
say
i
have
kept
in
touch
ever
since
a
year
or
so
afterwards
i
edited
ward
s
reminiscences
which
was
almost
without
exception
well
received
by
the
press
some
papers
vanity
fair
and
the
weekly
graphic
for
graphic
has
always
been
very
kind
and
fair
to
me
the
book
several
lengthy
and
highly
eulogistic
notices
ward
is
a
believer
in
ghosts
and
in
her
reminiscences
there
is
a
very
interesting
experience
of
hers
with
the
superphysical
ward
s
children
apart
from
the
fact
that
they
inherit
talent
from
their
mother
and
father
and
grandfather
their
james
ward
and
their
george
morland
are
very
interesting
in
themselves
and
possess
exceptional
personal
attractions
a
year
after
i
first
visited
their
house
i
was
commissioned
by
the
editor
of
the
weekly
despatch
beuley
to
write
a
series
of
ghostly
experiences
for
that
paper
in
order
to
do
this
i
made
pilgrimages
to
all
parts
of
the
country
and
in
my
zeal
to
find
ghosts
occasionally
encountered
objects
of
a
very
different
nature
on
one
occasion
in
brighton
i
had
taken
advantage
of
a
slightly
open
window
to
enter
a
tiny
house
i
had
been
told
was
very
badly
haunted
it
was
a
very
dark
night
and
being
unable
to
find
my
matches
i
had
to
grope
my
way
about
i
was
in
a
room
with
apparently
never
ending
seemed
to
go
round
and
round
without
any
outlet
at
all
at
last
however
i
managed
to
discover
a
doorway
and
passing
through
it
i
felt
my
way
to
a
staircase
which
i
climbed
up
till
i
came
to
what
i
judged
to
be
a
landing
there
all
further
speculations
were
brought
to
an
abrupt
end
by
my
suddenly
falling
over
some
large
soft
object
on
the
floor
in
an
instant
there
was
a
loud
yell
and
i
found
myself
rolling
over
and
over
clawing
and
clutching
at
some
foul
and
unsavoury
mass
that
seemed
to
have
fastened
itself
on
to
me
with
the
intention
of
first
probing
out
my
eyes
and
then
throttling
me
the
small
flask
of
whiskey
that
i
happened
to
have
on
me
undoubtedly
saved
me
from
total
annihilation
the
moment
the
hands
touched
the
flask
i
was
free
i
staggered
to
my
feet
searched
again
and
this
time
fortunately
found
the
and
struck
a
light
crouching
on
the
floor
in
front
of
me
was
a
long
thin
scraggy
creature
with
an
absolutely
bloodless
face
and
two
big
round
protruding
black
eyes
its
hair
was
matted
like
a
mop
and
tossed
about
anywhere
its
clothes
or
rather
rags
were
buttonless
and
only
held
together
here
and
there
by
pieces
of
filthy
string
a
more
disgusting
and
at
the
same
time
pitiable
spectacle
could
not
be
imagined
it
was
fortunate
for
me
that
i
had
had
previous
experience
of
such
sights
in
the
parks
and
commons
of
london
otherwise
i
should
have
been
terrified
out
of
my
wits
as
it
was
i
only
just
managed
to
pull
myself
together
and
realising
that
what
i
saw
before
me
was
not
a
ghost
but
a
material
and
now
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
harmless
being
i
spoke
to
it
well
i
said
at
any
rate
you
seem
to
like
my
whiskey
how
long
have
you
been
here
the
flask
was
gradually
lowered
and
a
voice
which
i
decided
was
that
of
a
up
to
the
present
i
hadn
t
been
able
to
decipher
its
i
sleep
here
every
night
this
is
my
then
the
enigma
is
solved
i
said
you
are
the
ghost
i
soon
shall
be
the
creature
replied
for
i
ve
eaten
nothing
for
more
than
two
well
i
m
afraid
i
can
not
give
you
any
more
than
this
i
said
for
it
s
all
i
have
with
and
i
handed
her
some
biscuits
and
bread
and
cheese
never
shall
i
forget
the
savage
joy
with
which
she
snatched
the
food
from
my
hand
and
crammed
it
into
her
big
gaping
fleshless
jaws
no
animal
in
the
zoo
was
half
so
voracious
when
she
had
finished
it
all
and
drained
the
last
drop
of
whiskey
she
drew
her
lean
and
dirty
albeit
fingers
across
her
mouth
and
cursed
me
get
you
gone
she
snarled
and
leave
me
here
i
tell
you
this
is
my
house
i
ve
as
much
right
to
it
as
you
or
anyone
else
get
you
gone
or
i
ll
spit
at
and
not
wishing
to
be
spat
upon
i
picked
up
my
flask
and
departed
i
encountered
another
ghost
of
this
order
three
nights
later
in
a
house
in
manchester
the
house
was
furnished
but
was
untenanted
as
the
owner
a
rich
and
eccentric
old
lady
believed
it
to
be
haunted
she
wrote
to
me
of
my
book
ghostly
phenomena
and
suggested
i
should
try
and
exorcise
the
ghost
now
i
do
not
altogether
believe
in
exorcism
there
are
occasions
upon
which
it
has
been
practised
with
success
mostly
in
cases
of
haunting
by
phantasms
of
the
sane
dead
but
there
are
also
many
cases
within
my
own
experience
in
which
it
has
been
practised
with
no
result
whatever
at
all
events
with
my
elastic
views
regarding
denominational
religion
i
did
not
feel
disposed
to
try
it
and
so
i
wrote
and
told
her
she
replied
come
in
any
case
and
give
me
your
opinion
as
to
the
nature
and
cause
of
the
i
went
the
house
was
in
a
quiet
sleepy
thoroughfare
not
three
minutes
walk
from
the
whalley
road
it
was
big
and
roomy
and
would
have
been
attractive
but
for
the
walls
the
papers
of
which
had
obviously
been
chosen
by
someone
who
did
not
possess
even
the
most
elementary
conception
of
what
is
pleasing
in
colour
and
design
as
it
was
my
artistic
susceptibilities
were
so
grossly
outraged
that
i
could
well
have
imagined
the
place
haunted
by
neutrarians
of
the
most
undesirable
order
i
visited
the
house
in
the
early
evening
and
the
subdued
light
from
the
sunshine
filtering
through
the
drawn
venetian
blinds
produced
a
singularly
sad
and
at
the
same
time
ghostly
effect
i
had
come
unaccompanied
for
nothing
on
earth
would
persuade
the
old
lady
or
any
of
her
domestics
to
set
a
foot
in
the
house
and
as
i
wandered
through
room
after
room
the
intense
hush
began
at
length
to
tell
on
my
nerves
when
i
was
on
the
staircase
leading
to
the
top
storey
i
fancied
i
heard
a
slight
noise
and
a
sudden
faintness
coming
over
me
i
had
to
clutch
hold
of
the
banisters
to
prevent
myself
falling
i
went
on
however
and
opening
a
door
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
found
myself
in
a
large
room
communicating
with
two
other
rooms
by
means
of
doors
both
of
which
stood
slightly
ajar
i
had
passed
through
the
first
and
was
half
across
the
floor
of
the
second
when
i
suddenly
felt
one
of
my
ankles
caught
hold
of
the
shock
was
so
great
that
all
the
blood
in
my
body
seemed
suddenly
to
dry
up
and
again
i
all
but
fainted
forcing
myself
to
look
down
however
i
perceived
a
skinny
hand
and
arm
protruding
from
under
the
and
assured
by
the
appearance
of
it
that
it
belonged
to
nothing
ghostly
i
struck
at
it
with
my
stick
kicking
out
vigorously
at
the
same
time
with
terrible
howlings
there
now
crawled
from
under
the
table
a
long
and
lanky
idiot
boy
it
transpired
that
he
was
the
son
of
one
of
the
old
lady
s
servants
and
that
he
was
enjoying
a
nice
comfortable
home
at
her
expense
his
mother
used
to
visit
him
every
evening
and
this
evening
he
had
hidden
under
the
table
with
the
intention
of
frightening
her
unfortunately
for
them
both
however
he
had
frightened
me
instead
the
servant
of
course
lost
her
post
and
the
old
lady
assured
that
there
was
no
longer
any
fear
of
ghosts
came
back
to
the
house
and
at
my
suggestion
had
all
the
walls
the
following
week
i
had
another
rather
strange
experience
in
liverpool
i
was
getting
dozens
of
letters
weekly
at
that
time
as
the
first
of
my
series
of
ghost
stories
had
appeared
in
the
weekly
despatch
and
my
fame
as
a
spook
hunter
had
spread
far
and
wide
in
consequence
a
lady
in
liverpool
wrote
to
me
saying
that
her
daughter
emily
was
tormented
by
a
man
coming
into
her
bedroom
every
night
at
the
same
time
and
walking
off
with
her
bedclothes
he
said
nothing
merely
opened
her
door
and
approaching
the
bed
on
caught
hold
of
the
clothes
and
hurriedly
retreated
with
them
spirit
lights
my
correspondent
added
were
constantly
seen
in
the
room
and
at
times
figures
like
angels
and
she
would
be
glad
if
i
would
visit
the
house
and
discover
for
her
if
possible
some
explanation
of
the
occurrences
the
nature
of
the
manifestations
being
somewhat
extraordinary
i
thought
it
discreet
to
take
a
friend
the
house
was
in
a
crescent
close
to
clayton
square
we
were
shown
into
the
where
all
the
family
were
assembled
and
we
were
at
once
regaled
with
detailed
accounts
of
all
that
was
alleged
to
happen
then
we
were
taken
to
the
bedroom
that
was
haunted
and
the
young
lady
whose
bed
the
ghost
stripped
at
our
request
sat
there
with
us
as
soon
as
the
electric
light
was
switched
off
she
began
to
see
spirit
lights
we
saw
nothing
no
man
appeared
and
on
taking
our
departure
we
both
agreed
that
the
phenomena
were
subjective
and
that
it
was
simply
a
case
of
hallucination
accordingly
i
advised
her
mother
to
consult
a
good
general
practitioner
as
in
all
probability
her
daughter
needed
a
tonic
and
change
of
air
i
strongly
warned
her
against
consulting
any
professional
spiritualist
well
i
returned
to
london
and
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
till
the
following
christmas
when
quite
by
chance
i
ran
against
a
young
doctor
to
whom
i
had
mentioned
the
incident
evidently
eager
to
communicate
something
he
remarked
you
remember
that
liverpool
case
you
told
me
case
of
the
young
lady
whose
bedclothes
used
to
disappear
and
which
you
thought
was
hallucination
well
you
were
mistaken
since
i
saw
you
i
have
become
acquainted
with
the
doctor
who
attends
her
and
he
told
me
that
whilst
he
was
there
one
day
the
bedroom
door
opened
and
in
walked
a
young
man
he
says
the
girl
immediately
exclaimed
here
is
the
man
who
haunts
my
room
at
night
for
goodness
sake
doctor
do
something
whereupon
the
man
muttering
some
words
in
german
abruptly
left
the
room
my
doctor
friend
immediately
ran
after
him
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
although
the
house
was
at
once
searched
no
traces
of
him
could
be
found
now
what
do
you
think
of
the
case
it
is
certainly
a
very
unusual
one
i
replied
and
as
you
say
this
sequel
quite
upsets
my
theory
of
hallucination
it
may
be
a
case
of
projection
someone
who
knows
the
girl
and
wishes
to
torment
her
is
experimenting
in
visiting
her
in
his
immaterial
ego
i
have
heard
of
similar
but
she
knows
no
one
like
him
my
friend
responded
probably
not
i
said
the
image
she
sees
may
be
and
very
likely
is
merely
an
assumed
one
does
she
know
any
indians
or
anyone
who
is
an
earnest
student
of
the
occult
find
out
if
you
i
have
not
yet
heard
from
my
friend
but
i
still
incline
to
the
idea
that
the
ghost
in
this
case
was
a
phantasm
of
the
living
rather
than
a
phantasm
of
the
dead
chapter
xv
some
strange
cases
in
birmingham
harrogate
sussex
and
newcastle
whilst
i
was
still
writing
for
the
weekly
despatch
i
happened
to
visit
an
old
friend
of
mine
a
captain
rupert
tennison
who
was
staying
with
an
aged
relative
in
the
hagley
road
birmingham
this
is
hardly
the
house
you
would
expect
to
see
a
ghost
in
is
it
he
remarked
to
me
after
luncheon
and
yet
i
can
assure
you
i
had
a
very
remarkable
psychic
experience
here
in
this
very
room
i
ve
often
wanted
to
tell
you
about
it
it
happened
one
new
year
s
eve
three
and
a
half
years
ago
my
aunt
had
a
nephew
on
her
husband
s
side
called
jack
wilmot
and
he
and
i
used
to
meet
here
regularly
at
the
commencement
of
every
new
year
on
this
occasion
however
my
aunt
informed
me
that
wilmot
was
unable
to
be
present
as
he
was
detained
in
mexico
where
he
had
a
very
good
post
as
a
mining
engineer
i
was
much
disappointed
for
wilmot
and
i
were
great
pals
and
the
prospect
of
staying
here
alone
with
the
old
lady
struck
me
as
perfectly
appalling
i
resolved
to
make
the
best
of
it
however
for
i
was
genuinely
sorry
for
my
aunt
whom
i
could
see
was
quite
as
disappointed
as
i
was
i
arrived
late
in
the
afternoon
of
december
we
dined
at
seven
and
at
nine
my
aunt
went
off
to
bed
and
left
me
in
this
room
by
myself
for
some
time
i
not
one
of
your
books
o
guy
maupassant
but
the
light
being
rather
bad
and
my
eyes
tired
for
i
had
been
travelling
all
the
previous
night
i
was
at
last
obliged
to
desist
and
devote
myself
entirely
to
a
pipe
the
servants
went
to
bed
at
about
ten
i
heard
them
tap
respectfully
at
my
aunt
s
door
on
their
way
and
wish
her
after
that
the
house
was
absolutely
silent
so
silent
indeed
that
the
hush
began
to
get
on
my
nerves
and
i
was
contemplating
retiring
also
when
heavy
footsteps
suddenly
crossed
the
hall
and
the
door
of
this
room
was
flung
wide
open
i
looked
round
in
amazement
standing
on
the
threshold
was
wilmot
why
jack
i
cried
i
am
glad
to
see
you
old
fellow
your
aunt
told
me
you
could
not
come
how
did
you
manage
it
quite
easily
he
said
in
the
light
careless
manner
which
was
one
of
his
characteristics
where
there
s
a
will
there
s
a
way
you
know
i
ve
taken
french
taken
french
leave
i
ejaculated
then
there
ll
be
the
deuce
to
pay
when
you
get
back
anyhow
that
s
your
affair
not
mine
you
ll
have
some
supper
no
he
said
i
had
a
very
good
meal
a
short
time
ago
and
i
m
not
the
least
bit
hungry
we
will
chat
he
pulled
his
chair
up
to
the
table
and
leaning
his
elbows
on
it
stared
right
into
my
face
you
don
t
look
very
well
jack
i
said
maybe
this
strong
light
has
something
to
do
with
it
but
you
are
as
pale
as
a
sheet
is
it
the
voyage
not
altogether
he
replied
i
ve
had
a
lot
of
trouble
tell
me
i
said
won
t
it
bore
you
he
replied
after
all
why
should
i
bother
other
people
with
my
woes
oh
all
right
i
will
if
you
like
some
months
ago
there
came
to
the
town
where
i
am
working
a
wealthy
spaniard
and
his
wife
their
name
was
hervada
he
was
a
tall
lean
old
curmudgeon
and
she
one
of
the
most
beautiful
young
creatures
you
can
imagine
you
can
guess
what
happened
you
fell
in
love
with
her
of
course
i
cried
from
the
moment
i
saw
her
jack
replied
you
got
introduced
i
said
trust
me
he
laughed
i
found
out
where
she
lived
and
the
rest
was
so
easy
that
before
the
end
of
the
week
i
had
dined
with
them
and
also
had
had
one
clandestine
meeting
in
the
park
at
first
her
old
villain
of
a
husband
suspected
nothing
but
it
is
infernally
hard
to
keep
up
a
pretence
for
long
when
one
is
really
madly
consumed
with
passion
eyes
are
sure
indicators
of
what
the
heart
feels
at
least
mine
are
and
when
hervada
suddenly
looked
up
and
caught
me
gazing
at
his
wife
as
if
i
could
devour
her
the
cat
was
completely
out
of
the
bag
i
give
him
credit
for
one
thing
however
he
took
it
very
calmly
despite
his
unprepossessing
exterior
he
could
at
times
be
extremely
courteous
and
dignified
you
will
oblige
me
by
settling
this
matter
in
the
way
customary
to
gentlemen
in
this
country
he
said
you
must
remember
you
are
not
in
england
now
you
are
in
mexico
have
you
a
revolver
i
am
never
without
one
i
replied
then
he
observed
ignoring
the
intervention
of
his
wife
whose
apprehensions
were
only
too
plainly
more
on
my
account
than
on
his
we
will
step
on
to
the
what
i
said
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
actually
fought
a
duel
jack
nodded
yes
he
said
we
measured
off
twenty
paces
and
then
turning
round
and
you
killed
him
that
would
be
your
natural
surmise
was
the
reply
but
you
are
mistaken
it
was
i
who
was
the
moment
he
had
said
these
words
he
seemed
to
fade
away
and
before
i
could
recover
from
my
astonishment
he
had
completely
disappeared
and
i
found
myself
staring
not
at
him
but
the
blank
wall
and
now
comes
the
oddest
part
of
it
i
naturally
expected
to
hear
jack
was
dead
i
said
nothing
to
my
aunt
but
i
wrote
off
to
his
address
at
once
judge
then
of
my
relief
when
i
received
a
letter
from
him
by
return
of
post
to
say
he
was
absolutely
fit
and
well
and
getting
on
splendidly
that
was
in
february
in
the
following
august
my
aunt
wrote
to
me
saying
a
very
tragic
occurrence
had
taken
place
jack
was
dead
he
had
been
found
on
the
verandah
of
an
hotel
in
mexico
shot
through
the
heart
though
the
identity
of
his
murderer
was
generally
suspected
there
was
no
actual
proof
and
as
the
man
was
very
rich
and
influential
it
was
thought
quite
useless
to
take
up
the
case
now
what
kind
of
superphysical
phenomenon
do
you
call
that
captain
tennison
concluded
i
can
t
exactly
say
i
replied
it
is
one
of
those
strange
prognostications
of
the
future
that
happen
more
often
on
new
year
s
eve
than
on
any
other
day
of
the
year
i
don
t
think
the
phantasm
you
saw
was
actually
wilmot
s
spirit
i
don
t
see
how
it
could
have
been
i
think
it
was
an
impersonating
neutrarian
one
of
that
order
of
phantasms
that
have
never
inhabited
any
kind
of
material
body
and
whose
special
function
is
apparently
to
foretell
the
end
of
certain
people
and
certain
people
when
i
had
finished
my
articles
for
the
weekly
despatch
which
i
was
writing
in
alternation
with
the
reminiscences
of
ward
i
took
a
brief
holiday
visiting
for
the
first
time
matlock
and
harrogate
learning
that
there
was
an
alleged
haunted
house
in
the
latter
town
i
sought
and
managed
to
obtain
permission
to
spend
a
night
in
it
it
was
a
modern
edifice
of
a
great
height
situated
about
ten
minutes
walk
from
james
hall
i
went
there
alone
and
on
entering
the
premises
encountered
an
almost
air
of
stillness
which
contrasted
oddly
with
the
world
outside
where
all
was
life
and
gaiety
but
a
moment
before
i
had
mixed
with
the
streams
of
people
heading
for
the
spa
concert
the
theatre
and
the
valley
park
and
so
free
had
they
seemed
from
all
trouble
and
full
of
sparkling
spontaneous
fun
and
above
all
so
full
of
the
flamboyant
spirit
of
sheer
life
that
one
could
not
help
feeling
as
one
looked
at
them
that
after
all
there
could
be
no
such
thing
as
death
for
such
pronounced
vitality
must
go
on
for
ever
but
this
forsaken
house
void
of
furniture
of
everything
save
the
soft
summer
evening
sunlight
the
shadows
and
my
different
wandering
from
room
to
room
and
floor
to
floor
i
at
length
completed
my
preliminary
search
and
being
somewhat
tired
i
sat
down
on
the
floor
of
the
hall
and
taking
a
newspaper
from
my
pocket
started
reading
as
the
hours
passed
by
and
darkness
came
on
i
began
to
be
afraid
no
amount
of
experience
in
ghost
hunting
will
ever
enable
me
to
overcome
that
awful
hideous
fear
that
seizes
me
when
i
see
the
last
glimmer
of
daylight
fade
and
i
realise
i
am
about
to
be
brought
into
contact
with
the
superphysical
and
that
i
must
face
noises
in
empty
houses
i
have
noticed
usually
commence
in
the
basement
and
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
when
presently
i
heard
a
faint
tapping
proceeding
from
one
of
the
kitchens
this
was
followed
by
a
long
spell
of
silence
and
then
one
of
the
stairs
creaked
my
heart
gave
a
big
thump
and
i
gazed
expectantly
into
the
darkness
before
me
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
silence
again
and
then
more
tapping
and
more
creaking
something
then
tickled
my
hand
and
a
moment
later
my
fingers
touched
a
blackbeetle
in
an
instant
i
was
on
my
feet
for
i
dread
beetles
more
than
i
dread
ghosts
and
on
my
striking
a
light
i
found
the
whole
floor
swarming
i
wondered
very
much
at
this
because
beetles
do
not
as
a
rule
frequent
houses
that
have
been
empty
for
any
length
of
time
especially
in
a
climate
like
that
of
harrogate
i
have
since
however
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
where
there
are
hauntings
there
are
more
often
than
not
plagues
of
beetles
but
whether
attracted
by
the
ghost
or
not
i
can
not
say
as
i
could
no
longer
tolerate
the
idea
of
remaining
in
the
hall
in
the
dark
i
lighted
four
candles
and
placing
them
on
the
floor
sat
in
the
midst
of
them
it
was
only
eleven
o
clock
by
my
watch
and
the
idea
of
keeping
up
my
vigil
till
the
morning
did
not
strike
me
as
particularly
pleasant
i
took
up
my
paper
and
again
began
to
read
half
an
hour
or
so
passed
and
then
i
received
a
start
a
door
opened
and
shut
downstairs
and
bare
footsteps
pattered
their
way
along
the
stone
passage
and
up
the
wooden
stairs
the
nearer
they
drew
the
more
intolerable
became
my
suspense
what
should
i
see
a
phantasm
of
the
dead
or
some
neutrarian
which
would
it
be
i
confess
i
would
have
given
all
i
possessed
to
be
out
in
the
road
but
as
is
usually
the
case
with
me
when
in
the
presence
of
the
superphysical
i
was
quite
powerless
to
speak
or
move
then
to
my
unfeigned
astonishment
instead
of
anything
grotesque
and
awful
there
appeared
before
me
a
little
girl
clad
in
a
pinafore
and
without
either
shoes
or
stockings
though
not
actually
crying
she
appeared
in
great
distress
and
feeling
around
on
all
sides
as
if
anxiously
searching
for
someone
she
ran
past
me
and
commenced
to
ascend
the
stairs
picking
up
a
candle
i
followed
her
and
as
the
patterings
of
her
poor
chilled
feet
spread
their
echoes
far
and
wide
through
the
vast
deserted
house
i
thought
i
had
never
experienced
anything
half
so
pathetic
on
and
on
we
went
the
little
thin
legs
leading
the
way
till
we
reached
the
top
storey
when
she
ran
into
a
room
facing
me
and
slammed
the
door
i
immediately
followed
but
the
room
was
quite
empty
there
were
no
signs
of
the
child
there
was
only
a
particularly
vivid
beam
of
moonlight
and
a
virile
and
overwhelming
atmosphere
of
sadness
during
the
next
few
days
i
was
told
a
story
that
fully
accounted
for
the
hauntings
it
appears
that
about
thirty
years
before
my
visit
to
the
house
a
little
girl
had
lived
there
with
her
father
and
her
nurse
to
whom
she
was
very
much
attached
being
summarily
dismissed
by
her
she
became
ill
and
very
soon
died
so
it
was
rumoured
of
a
broken
heart
shortly
after
her
death
the
house
was
to
let
and
no
tenant
i
found
out
has
ever
occupied
it
since
for
very
long
i
have
often
wished
that
i
had
spoken
to
the
sad
little
spirit
but
i
was
too
fascinated
by
it
and
too
much
engaged
watching
its
movements
to
think
of
anything
else
and
i
have
found
that
this
same
fascination
and
preoccupation
have
prevented
me
from
trying
to
communicate
with
the
ghost
in
nearly
all
the
cases
of
haunting
that
i
have
ever
investigated
on
the
few
occasions
that
i
have
spoken
to
a
phantasm
i
have
received
no
reply
no
indication
even
that
it
has
heard
me
in
a
very
famous
haunted
house
in
the
west
of
england
during
my
investigations
which
were
spread
over
a
period
of
nine
not
uninterruptedly
consecutive
nights
manifestations
took
place
twice
and
on
both
occasions
i
stood
up
and
spoke
but
in
neither
case
was
there
any
response
whatever
this
same
ghost
had
been
subjected
to
exorcism
by
a
ecclesiast
but
far
from
being
exorcised
the
ghost
so
scared
his
exorciser
that
he
all
but
fainted
these
demonstrations
were
visual
in
a
haunted
house
that
i
was
asked
to
visit
in
sussex
i
saw
nothing
but
heard
knockings
and
by
means
of
them
tried
though
without
success
to
establish
a
code
i
heard
of
the
case
in
this
way
a
young
lady
whom
i
will
call
miss
hemming
wrote
to
me
she
and
her
mother
occupied
a
modern
and
picturesquely
situated
house
at
the
foot
of
the
downs
and
were
very
frequently
disturbed
she
said
between
nine
and
ten
in
the
evening
by
sounds
such
as
might
be
made
with
a
muffled
hammer
on
the
wall
of
her
mother
s
room
simultaneously
the
figure
of
a
young
man
moved
noiselessly
across
the
lawn
from
the
direction
of
a
swing
he
usually
approached
her
window
and
came
to
a
halt
immediately
beneath
it
he
had
never
replied
when
spoken
to
she
had
fired
at
him
several
times
but
the
bullets
had
had
no
effect
whatever
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
passed
right
through
him
because
he
still
stood
there
whilst
the
gravel
was
splattered
up
immediately
behind
him
on
one
or
two
occasions
he
shone
a
bicycle
lamp
on
his
face
so
that
she
could
distinctly
see
his
features
it
was
the
face
of
no
one
she
knew
though
she
fancied
it
bore
a
close
resemblance
to
a
notorious
murderer
whose
photos
had
been
in
the
papers
and
who
had
expiated
his
crime
on
the
gallows
these
were
not
the
only
manifestations
stones
had
been
repeatedly
thrown
at
hemming
and
although
the
house
was
being
closely
watched
by
the
police
the
still
went
on
and
so
far
the
culprit
had
not
even
been
seen
let
alone
caught
i
visited
the
house
once
by
myself
and
once
with
a
party
of
men
on
the
former
occasion
i
hid
in
a
little
copse
at
the
furthest
extremity
of
the
lawn
and
watched
the
house
and
swing
closely
but
i
neither
heard
nor
saw
anything
returning
to
the
house
i
was
told
by
miss
hemming
that
both
she
and
her
mother
had
heard
the
knockings
and
that
she
herself
had
at
the
same
time
seen
the
figure
on
the
lawn
on
the
occasion
of
my
second
visit
we
all
heard
the
knockings
on
the
wall
of
hemming
s
room
and
one
of
us
who
was
looking
out
of
her
daughter
s
window
saw
what
he
fancied
were
two
shadows
of
human
beings
cross
the
moonlit
lawn
and
vanish
in
the
direction
of
a
hedge
trickery
was
practically
impossible
as
the
garden
was
protected
on
all
sides
by
barbed
wire
and
there
were
on
the
premises
four
or
five
dogs
including
a
young
bloodhound
we
had
of
course
made
a
thorough
search
of
the
house
and
grounds
previously
one
or
two
other
incidents
happened
during
the
night
when
i
was
in
the
hall
alone
a
light
as
from
a
bicycle
lamp
was
suddenly
shone
in
my
face
apparently
from
a
blank
wall
and
when
we
were
all
seated
in
front
of
the
fire
we
heard
heavy
footsteps
cross
the
hall
and
although
we
ran
out
at
once
we
could
see
no
one
we
were
shown
the
stones
that
were
alleged
to
have
been
thrown
but
none
were
thrown
whilst
we
were
there
they
were
a
peculiar
kind
of
flint
which
certainly
did
not
belong
to
the
neighbourhood
hemming
had
several
times
narrowly
escaped
being
hit
by
them
and
one
had
crashed
through
the
bedroom
window
as
she
was
looking
out
of
it
i
did
not
continue
my
investigation
of
the
case
because
there
were
certain
features
in
connection
with
it
of
a
private
and
family
nature
which
greatly
added
to
its
complexity
and
which
would
of
necessity
have
rendered
any
attempt
at
solution
incomplete
and
unsatisfactory
cases
of
complex
haunting
although
for
obvious
reasons
seldom
admitting
of
any
satisfactory
explanation
always
interest
me
the
most
here
is
one
i
chanced
to
hit
upon
in
newcastle
a
house
in
street
had
stood
empty
for
seven
or
eight
years
and
on
my
making
enquiries
about
it
i
was
told
to
apply
to
a
black
the
last
tenant
i
did
so
and
black
very
kindly
gave
me
a
detailed
account
of
what
had
taken
place
there
during
his
tenancy
it
was
as
follows
a
day
or
two
after
our
arrival
i
happened
to
be
going
upstairs
and
as
i
passed
by
one
of
the
bedrooms
the
door
of
which
was
slightly
open
i
glanced
in
and
saw
the
figure
of
a
lady
whom
i
had
never
seen
before
she
was
dressed
in
green
and
standing
in
front
of
the
engaged
apparently
in
putting
on
her
hat
wondering
who
on
earth
she
could
be
for
i
knew
the
room
had
not
been
slept
in
i
spoke
to
her
and
receiving
no
reply
i
was
advancing
towards
her
when
she
suddenly
disappeared
i
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
the
affair
but
thinking
that
possibly
it
was
an
hallucination
i
resolved
to
think
no
more
of
it
and
to
say
nothing
about
it
to
any
of
my
family
or
household
some
days
later
however
when
out
walking
with
my
wife
i
met
a
friend
who
asked
me
where
i
was
living
i
told
him
and
he
exclaimed
excitedly
good
gracious
not
in
that
house
why
my
dear
at
a
sign
from
me
he
stopped
i
had
guessed
what
was
coming
and
as
my
wife
is
extremely
nervous
i
thought
it
best
she
should
not
hear
what
i
knew
he
was
going
to
say
namely
that
the
house
was
haunted
that
night
i
went
round
to
see
my
friend
he
made
no
bones
about
it
he
told
me
that
the
house
i
had
taken
was
he
knew
it
for
a
fact
some
months
ago
he
said
i
was
thinking
of
taking
it
myself
and
obtaining
the
key
from
the
agent
went
to
look
over
it
it
was
quite
light
not
more
than
five
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
and
the
house
seemed
bright
and
cheerful
closing
the
front
door
carefully
behind
me
i
commenced
a
tour
of
the
premises
i
had
reached
the
top
floor
and
was
standing
in
the
centre
of
one
of
the
rooms
when
i
heard
a
slight
noise
i
started
and
turning
round
in
the
direction
from
which
the
sound
came
perceived
a
lady
and
a
little
girl
standing
in
the
doorway
watching
me
there
was
nothing
at
all
remarkable
about
them
the
lady
was
dressed
in
green
the
child
in
white
both
modern
or
at
least
comparatively
modern
costumes
i
was
so
surprised
at
their
being
there
however
as
i
knew
i
had
shut
the
hall
door
that
i
simply
stood
and
stared
at
them
then
something
much
more
extraordinary
vanished
it
was
not
an
i
can
swear
thoroughly
scared
i
tore
downstairs
and
out
of
the
house
after
this
i
gave
up
all
idea
of
taking
the
place
and
i
can
t
help
feeling
sorry
old
fellow
that
you
ve
taken
in
spite
of
this
warning
black
continued
i
did
not
give
up
the
house
immediately
after
we
had
been
there
a
week
or
so
a
cousin
of
mine
came
to
stay
with
us
and
one
evening
he
and
one
of
my
children
who
were
in
the
together
heard
a
soft
cautious
if
someone
were
giving
a
signal
coming
they
thought
from
just
behind
them
the
whistle
was
repeated
and
a
few
minutes
later
they
heard
a
loud
cry
half
human
half
animal
and
wholly
ominous
my
cousin
pretended
it
was
one
of
the
servants
but
my
child
would
not
be
convinced
and
begged
to
be
taken
to
bed
at
once
as
she
dared
not
remain
in
the
room
any
longer
after
this
phenomena
of
all
kinds
happened
steps
used
to
be
heard
bounding
up
and
down
the
stairs
at
all
hours
of
the
night
one
of
the
maids
declared
she
saw
something
that
was
a
man
and
yet
not
a
man
come
out
of
the
with
a
run
and
race
up
the
staircase
two
or
three
steps
at
a
time
heavy
pantings
and
sighs
were
heard
and
several
of
the
household
were
awakened
by
a
cold
hand
being
laid
upon
their
face
but
i
think
the
most
remarkable
thing
that
happened
is
this
was
sitting
in
my
study
one
evening
when
the
maid
rapped
at
my
door
and
said
that
a
clergyman
whom
she
had
shown
into
the
wished
to
see
me
on
some
very
urgent
matter
i
at
once
put
down
the
book
i
was
reading
and
hastening
to
the
found
it
empty
wondering
what
had
become
of
the
clergyman
i
was
about
to
ring
the
bell
to
enquire
when
i
suddenly
caught
sight
of
a
large
eye
human
in
shape
and
horribly
sinister
glaring
at
me
from
behind
an
i
was
so
frightened
that
i
could
do
nothing
but
stare
back
at
it
and
then
to
my
intense
relief
my
wife
entered
the
room
with
a
friend
and
the
phenomenon
illustration
i
suddenly
caught
sight
of
a
large
eye
and
the
parson
i
observed
i
never
heard
anything
more
of
him
black
remarked
the
maid
assured
me
on
her
honour
that
she
had
shown
him
into
the
room
but
no
one
saw
him
leave
the
house
so
he
too
might
have
been
a
ghost
but
supposing
him
to
have
been
a
living
person
his
disappearance
would
not
be
unnatural
he
had
doubtless
seen
the
eye
and
precipitated
himself
into
the
street
through
the
open
window
the
following
day
my
children
being
badly
frightened
by
something
in
one
of
the
passages
i
decided
to
leave
the
house
and
although
i
afterwards
made
every
possible
enquiry
i
could
never
hear
of
anything
particularly
tragic
that
had
ever
happened
there
we
were
the
first
tenants
so
i
was
told
that
had
ever
complained
of
disturbances
and
it
was
suggested
that
we
might
have
brought
the
ghosts
with
us
but
as
none
of
us
had
ever
seen
a
ghost
before
we
entered
that
house
and
we
had
no
old
furniture
at
least
none
that
we
had
not
always
had
and
not
one
of
us
had
ever
attended
a
s√©ance
or
in
any
way
dabbled
with
spiritualism
i
do
not
think
that
theory
at
all
possible
how
do
you
account
for
the
hauntings
i
can
not
i
replied
nor
can
anyone
else
the
sheer
complexity
of
such
a
case
renders
any
definite
conclusion
with
regard
to
it
extremely
difficult
and
any
positive
solution
of
it
utterly
out
of
the
chapter
xvi
war
ghosts
of
late
years
the
increase
of
interest
taken
in
things
psychical
particularly
among
the
more
educated
classes
the
classes
that
were
at
one
time
incorrigibly
sceptical
has
been
enormous
i
believe
this
to
be
mainly
due
to
the
fact
that
people
are
no
longer
satisfied
with
the
scriptural
declaration
of
another
world
they
want
proof
of
is
to
say
absolutely
authentic
and
corroborative
evidence
that
it
they
feel
that
they
can
only
obtain
such
evidence
by
witnessing
superphysical
manifestations
themselves
psychical
research
societies
perhaps
convince
them
even
less
than
the
bible
and
naturally
for
the
scientist
even
though
he
be
titled
can
hardly
hope
to
accomplish
in
one
generation
what
theologians
of
an
equal
if
not
superior
intelligence
have
attempted
and
failed
to
accomplish
throughout
the
ages
hence
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
one
can
learn
more
from
one
spontaneous
ghostly
manifestation
in
a
haunted
house
than
from
a
thousand
lectures
or
a
thousand
books
experience
is
the
only
medium
of
conviction
and
so
long
as
people
are
without
a
personal
experience
relating
to
another
world
they
can
never
really
believe
the
boy
in
rags
and
tatters
may
be
far
more
conversant
know
far
more
future
life
than
the
more
learned
professor
at
the
university
but
no
one
can
logically
claim
to
be
an
absolute
authority
on
the
unknown
the
most
any
of
us
can
those
of
us
who
have
actually
seen
and
heard
spirit
rest
do
not
to
speculate
when
we
attempt
to
do
more
we
label
ourselves
fools
of
all
the
professions
none
i
believe
is
more
interested
in
this
question
of
another
world
than
the
theatrical
i
have
a
great
many
friends
amongst
actors
and
actresses
and
i
find
them
not
only
keenly
interested
in
my
work
but
always
when
working
hard
share
my
vigils
in
a
haunted
house
only
the
other
day
at
a
concert
given
by
the
irish
literary
society
in
hanover
square
i
was
introduced
to
miss
odette
goimbault
who
recently
delighted
london
audiences
by
her
impersonation
of
the
child
doris
in
on
trial
at
the
lyric
theatre
odette
goimbault
is
unquestionably
there
is
much
in
her
looks
besides
mere
prettiness
she
has
eyes
that
are
extraordinarily
spiritual
eyes
that
seem
to
look
right
into
the
soul
of
things
and
see
things
that
are
not
generally
seen
by
ordinary
mortals
when
a
very
small
child
odette
goimbault
lived
with
her
mother
in
a
house
at
thornton
heath
a
lady
died
of
consumption
in
the
flat
immediately
beneath
goimbault
s
and
after
the
burial
odette
though
previously
very
fond
of
staying
up
late
used
every
night
precisely
at
seven
o
clock
to
beg
her
mother
to
take
her
upstairs
to
bed
declaring
in
a
great
state
of
terror
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
that
she
saw
an
old
man
with
only
one
leg
standing
in
a
corner
of
the
room
shaking
his
stick
at
her
when
once
she
was
taken
out
of
the
room
her
fears
subsided
in
my
opinion
she
is
an
ideal
young
actress
for
the
pourtrayal
of
soul
for
the
transmittal
of
a
sense
of
soul
to
the
audience
and
i
think
there
is
no
one
either
on
the
stage
or
off
it
who
looks
more
in
touch
with
the
spiritual
world
than
odette
goimbault
but
stronger
even
than
its
hold
upon
the
theatrical
profession
is
the
stand
that
psychism
has
taken
with
regard
to
the
present
war
ever
since
the
fighting
began
i
have
heard
speculations
raised
as
to
whether
our
soldiers
at
the
front
have
been
witnessing
ghostly
manifestations
or
not
so
far
i
must
own
that
i
have
elicited
very
little
reliable
evidence
on
this
point
but
the
circumstances
have
established
at
least
one
interesting
fact
and
that
is
that
to
the
man
in
the
street
the
question
of
another
world
has
at
last
become
a
matter
of
some
importance
the
wife
of
a
very
eminent
official
at
the
war
office
told
me
a
few
weeks
ago
that
officers
who
took
part
in
the
dardanelles
expedition
assured
her
that
figures
believed
to
be
ghosts
were
on
several
occasions
seen
gliding
over
the
ground
after
an
engagement
especially
where
the
dead
bodies
of
the
turks
lay
thickest
the
same
lady
also
told
me
that
when
a
certain
regiment
formed
up
after
a
brilliant
charge
in
which
it
had
suffered
very
severe
casualties
some
of
the
gaps
in
the
ranks
were
observed
to
be
filled
by
shadowy
which
disappeared
the
moment
anyone
attempted
to
touch
them
neither
my
informant
nor
any
of
the
soldiers
from
the
front
that
i
have
met
have
been
able
to
give
me
any
information
as
to
the
alleged
superphysical
demonstrations
in
the
sky
during
the
retreat
from
mons
but
i
should
like
to
record
here
in
connection
with
the
war
a
case
i
heard
in
paris
i
published
an
account
of
it
in
the
november
number
of
the
occult
review
and
now
reproduce
it
through
the
courtesy
of
ralph
shirley
the
mention
of
ferdinand
of
bulgaria
brings
vividly
back
to
my
memory
two
stories
i
heard
about
him
when
i
was
dining
one
evening
in
june
at
the
renowned
henriette
s
restaurant
in
montparnasse
two
men
were
seated
at
a
table
close
beside
me
and
i
eventually
got
into
conversation
with
them
they
informed
me
they
were
journalists
and
that
their
names
were
guilgaut
and
bonivon
respectively
you
would
laugh
if
you
knew
where
i
spent
last
night
i
observed
i
was
in
an
alleged
haunted
flat
in
montrouge
i
don
t
suppose
either
of
you
believes
in
ghosts
i
do
guilgaut
said
i
have
had
more
than
one
experience
with
an
apparition
in
my
life
and
so
has
my
yes
chimed
in
bonivon
we
have
good
cause
to
remember
ghosts
since
we
stayed
six
weeks
in
a
haunted
hotel
in
bucharest
and
never
had
such
an
infernally
uncomfortable
time
either
before
or
since
we
never
saw
the
ghost
ourselves
but
one
of
the
other
lodgers
declared
he
did
and
used
to
wake
us
every
other
night
by
the
most
unholy
they
then
talked
a
lot
about
their
adventures
in
the
balkans
and
finally
alluded
to
ferdinand
of
bulgaria
if
ever
a
man
is
haunted
he
is
guilgaut
remarked
i
believe
he
never
leaves
his
room
at
night
without
the
shadow
of
stambuloff
whose
death
he
brought
about
in
it
simply
steps
out
from
the
wall
and
follows
that
is
a
lot
of
exaggeration
bonivon
said
with
a
laugh
but
quite
seriously
we
heard
on
very
excellent
authority
that
on
more
than
one
occasion
a
figure
has
been
seen
accompanying
ferdinand
sometimes
when
dining
and
sometimes
when
walking
and
that
it
has
been
recognised
by
the
spectators
as
stambuloff
the
dead
minister
once
we
were
told
ferdinand
visited
a
certain
princess
and
it
was
remarked
that
her
royal
highness
appeared
strangely
embarrassed
and
perturbed
at
last
someone
ventured
to
enquire
of
the
who
also
appeared
to
be
greatly
perturbed
what
was
the
matter
it
s
that
man
was
the
whispered
reply
that
man
who
persists
in
standing
beside
his
majesty
he
never
takes
his
eyes
from
our
faces
and
he
looks
just
like
a
her
interrogator
asked
her
to
describe
the
figure
which
he
said
was
quite
invisible
to
him
she
did
so
and
the
description
tallied
exactly
with
that
of
tell
him
about
ferdinand
and
the
guilgaut
said
yes
that
happened
when
we
were
staying
close
to
his
kohary
estates
bonivon
responded
ferdinand
is
notoriously
sly
and
mean
and
one
day
as
he
was
passing
through
the
village
where
we
were
staying
he
chanced
to
encounter
a
charming
hungarian
maiden
who
eked
out
a
very
precarious
livelihood
hawking
ribbons
and
telling
fortunes
ferdinand
had
his
hand
read
and
thinking
to
trap
the
girl
disguised
himself
and
went
to
her
again
the
following
evening
to
his
astonishment
although
the
was
skilful
for
ferdinand
is
a
born
actor
in
more
senses
than
one
the
girl
recognised
him
at
once
as
the
gentleman
who
had
been
to
her
the
previous
evening
i
was
expecting
you
she
said
expecting
me
ferdinand
stammered
how
is
that
i
ve
told
no
oh
fie
the
girl
remonstrated
shaking
her
finger
at
him
the
gentleman
who
accompanied
you
last
night
came
here
himself
an
hour
ago
and
told
me
you
were
what
was
he
like
ferdinand
asked
shaking
all
over
like
the
girl
retorted
pertly
why
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
and
she
rattled
off
a
description
of
the
man
which
tallied
exactly
with
that
of
the
dead
stambuloff
whom
guilgaut
and
i
had
seen
many
scores
of
times
in
the
early
eighties
your
friend
the
girl
continued
left
a
message
for
you
he
him
when
he
comes
that
he
will
perish
in
very
much
the
same
manner
as
i
have
done
and
he
showed
me
his
and
what
did
you
see
ferdinand
asked
i
saw
the
same
ending
to
the
life
line
in
his
hand
as
i
see
in
yours
the
girl
replied
why
there
is
your
friend
he
is
beckoning
to
you
you
had
better
go
to
and
to
her
astonishment
ferdinand
walked
off
in
the
opposite
direction
we
had
the
story
first
hand
she
told
it
us
two
or
three
days
afterwards
and
expressed
great
anxiety
as
to
the
identity
of
the
two
men
who
had
behaved
so
strangely
to
only
one
case
of
haunting
at
the
actual
front
has
been
related
to
me
i
will
state
it
in
my
own
words
it
happened
during
the
retreat
from
the
s
had
suffered
heavily
and
in
the
scramble
to
get
out
of
the
deadly
fire
zone
small
parties
of
them
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
country
had
got
isolated
from
the
main
body
and
left
behind
this
was
the
case
with
a
dozen
or
so
men
of
b
company
who
after
racing
across
a
field
amid
a
hail
of
shrapnel
had
clambered
over
a
formidable
barrier
of
barbed
wire
into
a
dense
wood
under
cover
of
a
thick
cluster
of
trees
they
sat
down
and
doctored
their
wounds
there
was
not
a
sound
man
amongst
them
sergeant
mackay
had
been
struck
in
three
places
in
his
right
leg
corporal
macintyre
had
had
a
good
square
inch
of
flesh
taken
off
his
thigh
private
findlay
had
lost
three
of
his
fingers
and
bugler
ear
while
in
addition
to
these
slight
inconveniences
they
were
all
ravenously
hungry
and
parched
with
thirst
i
suggest
said
sergeant
mackay
after
a
brief
lull
in
their
conversation
that
we
push
on
again
and
see
if
we
can
find
some
sort
of
habitation
where
we
can
get
a
aye
mon
corporal
macintyre
replied
for
during
such
sauve
qui
peuts
all
formality
of
rank
is
dropped
it
s
the
wee
drappie
i
m
thinking
after
and
unless
we
get
some
of
it
pretty
soon
there
ll
not
be
any
of
us
left
to
need
it
i
m
bleeding
like
a
pig
and
so
are
a
good
many
more
of
very
well
then
sergeant
mackay
observed
rising
with
difficulty
and
wincing
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
appear
comfortable
let
us
press
the
men
were
all
absolutely
ignorant
of
their
surroundings
they
had
seen
nothing
of
the
country
save
from
the
train
and
during
a
few
hours
tramp
from
the
railway
depot
to
the
lines
they
had
just
evacuated
consequently
for
all
they
knew
to
the
contrary
the
wood
that
lay
in
front
of
them
might
stretch
for
miles
or
might
be
inhabited
by
anything
from
grizly
bears
to
the
knowledge
of
the
british
tommy
with
regard
to
the
fauna
and
flora
of
belgium
is
extremely
limited
threading
their
way
through
the
thick
undergrowth
they
stole
stealthily
forward
the
roar
of
artillery
still
sounding
faintly
in
their
ears
till
at
length
they
emerged
into
a
wide
clearing
at
the
far
extremity
of
which
stood
a
neatly
thatched
white
cottage
it
was
so
with
its
small
plot
of
garden
its
walls
covered
with
clematis
and
honeysuckle
and
its
tiny
spiral
column
of
smoke
curling
heavenwards
that
the
bleeding
and
exhausted
men
gave
deep
sighs
of
relief
reminds
me
of
scotland
private
findlay
whispered
it
s
as
like
my
mother
s
cottage
as
two
peas
private
callum
retorted
they
halted
and
were
looking
at
sergeant
mackay
to
see
what
he
would
bold
as
the
s
are
in
battle
they
are
often
among
the
most
bashful
of
his
majesty
s
troops
in
time
of
suddenly
the
door
of
the
cottage
opened
and
an
old
woman
appeared
on
the
threshold
armed
with
a
blunderbuss
glaring
fiercely
and
shouting
she
put
the
weapon
to
her
hip
and
fired
there
was
a
loud
bang
and
one
or
two
of
the
men
uttered
ejaculations
of
pain
god
save
us
sergeant
mackay
cried
the
gude
wife
takes
us
for
then
addressing
the
woman
who
was
pouring
another
handful
of
shot
into
the
muzzle
of
her
infernal
piece
of
antiquity
he
called
out
are
ye
daft
or
glaikit
dinna
ken
that
we
are
scots
it
was
the
only
word
of
french
the
highlander
knew
and
on
shouting
it
three
times
in
rapid
succession
and
with
increased
emphasis
it
had
effect
the
old
woman
lowered
her
weapon
and
shading
her
eyes
with
a
lean
brown
and
knotted
hand
exclaimed
ah
moi
dieu
les
anglais
on
me
dit
que
les
anglais
sont
les
amis
des
belgiques
et
je
vous
aurai
tu√©
this
speech
was
of
course
lost
upon
the
highlanders
who
would
have
comic
was
the
picture
of
this
old
woman
with
the
ancient
they
not
been
faint
from
exhaustion
now
as
she
beckoned
to
them
to
approach
they
doffed
their
caps
and
filed
in
at
her
gate
sergeant
mackay
leading
the
way
the
interior
of
the
house
was
as
they
had
neat
and
clean
wipe
your
boots
boys
sergeant
mackay
whispered
we
mustn
t
put
the
old
lady
out
more
than
we
can
they
all
trooped
in
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
the
old
woman
vanished
through
a
low
doorway
reappearing
a
few
seconds
later
laden
with
bread
and
cheese
and
wine
which
she
watched
them
eat
and
drink
with
perfect
satisfaction
and
when
they
had
finished
conducted
them
to
a
loft
at
the
back
of
the
cottage
where
she
made
them
understand
by
signs
they
could
lie
as
long
as
they
pleased
i
kinna
think
sergeant
mackay
said
as
soon
as
their
hostess
had
retired
where
the
germans
are
it
s
passing
strange
they
have
not
put
in
an
appearance
maybe
they
ve
gone
by
and
missed
this
spot
it
s
nae
sae
handy
private
findlay
said
anyhow
i
m
for
it
s
ten
days
since
i
shut
my
it
s
the
same
with
me
ejaculated
private
mccallum
i
hae
not
slept
a
wink
since
we
left
apparently
they
were
all
of
the
same
that
they
needed
rest
and
without
further
ado
every
man
selected
a
place
in
the
hay
stretched
himself
out
at
full
length
and
was
soon
fast
asleep
the
afternoon
wore
away
the
sun
set
and
one
by
one
the
stars
made
their
appearance
but
still
the
men
slept
the
gloom
of
the
forest
thickened
and
with
the
long
and
waving
shadows
of
the
elms
and
beeches
crept
forth
forms
of
a
more
tangible
and
sinister
nature
sergeant
mackay
awoke
with
a
start
and
springing
to
his
feet
strained
his
ears
and
listened
nightmare
he
said
i
made
certain
the
germans
had
got
hold
of
me
weel
weel
it
s
nowt
but
a
dream
i
will
go
and
see
what
the
gude
wife
is
about
and
perhaps
if
she
hae
not
gone
to
bed
she
will
gie
us
some
hot
tea
or
red
wine
of
hers
hae
made
me
uncommon
he
scrambled
down
on
to
the
ground
and
leaving
the
rest
of
the
men
still
asleep
crossed
the
yard
and
pushed
open
the
door
leading
to
the
kitchen
he
was
about
to
enter
when
there
came
a
cry
and
the
front
of
the
house
filled
with
soldiers
sergeant
mackay
knew
them
at
were
germans
shrinking
back
into
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
he
stood
and
listened
though
he
could
not
understand
their
jargon
he
soon
formed
an
idea
of
what
was
taking
place
they
had
caught
the
old
woman
by
surprise
and
were
discussing
what
they
should
do
with
her
had
the
been
armed
sergeant
mackay
would
not
have
would
have
staked
anything
on
a
win
against
odds
at
six
to
one
but
in
their
hasty
flight
the
men
had
left
their
rifles
behind
them
and
it
would
be
sheer
suicide
for
them
to
attack
the
germans
with
their
bare
fists
therefore
it
at
once
entered
his
mind
to
slip
out
quietly
and
warn
his
comrades
so
that
they
could
escape
without
their
presence
being
detected
a
cry
of
pain
however
made
him
hesitate
two
germans
had
hold
of
the
old
woman
s
arms
and
were
twisting
them
round
the
difficulty
of
his
position
was
not
lost
on
sergeant
mackay
if
he
played
the
knight
errant
and
helped
the
old
woman
he
would
not
be
able
to
give
his
comrades
the
necessary
warning
and
they
would
all
be
taken
shot
on
the
other
hand
this
gude
wife
had
been
extremely
kind
to
them
and
was
proving
her
loyalty
by
maintaining
an
absolute
silence
as
to
their
presence
in
the
cottage
could
he
stand
by
and
see
her
abused
he
could
not
there
was
too
much
of
the
gael
in
him
for
that
and
as
the
old
woman
gave
another
gurgle
he
stepped
out
from
his
hiding
place
and
picking
up
a
kitchen
chair
rushed
at
her
captors
both
of
whom
he
stunned
he
was
of
course
eventually
borne
down
by
numbers
and
dragged
to
the
ground
what
shall
we
do
with
him
one
of
the
men
who
were
holding
him
asked
the
dog
he
has
broken
fritz
s
head
and
more
than
half
killed
hans
he
has
arms
like
a
hang
him
the
sergeant
in
charge
of
the
men
replied
tie
him
and
the
old
woman
together
and
hang
them
from
this
and
he
pointed
to
a
great
white
rafter
running
across
the
ceiling
sergeant
mackay
s
uniform
should
of
course
have
protected
him
but
then
as
the
german
sergeant
put
it
this
cottage
was
well
hidden
in
the
woods
the
english
were
evacuating
the
country
and
no
one
was
likely
to
come
across
the
bodies
saving
belgian
peasants
who
dare
not
say
anything
and
german
soldiers
who
would
not
say
anything
so
sergeant
mackay
was
dragged
up
from
the
floor
beaten
and
bruised
till
there
was
very
little
of
him
left
bound
tightly
to
the
old
gude
wife
and
hanged
with
her
the
germans
then
ransacked
the
house
and
were
preparing
to
explore
the
outer
premises
when
a
bugle
rang
out
and
they
hurriedly
left
the
cottage
ten
minutes
later
when
all
was
quiet
into
the
house
on
stole
the
rest
of
the
god
save
us
ejaculated
private
findlay
starting
back
and
pointing
to
the
grim
figures
swaying
gently
from
the
ceiling
god
save
us
sae
what
the
deils
hae
done
halt
the
word
of
the
colonel
transmitted
by
his
adjutant
to
the
head
of
the
column
brought
the
to
a
dead
stop
for
this
they
were
not
altogether
sorry
as
they
had
been
footing
it
for
eight
or
nine
hours
on
every
little
respite
was
welcome
but
the
colonel
in
this
instance
at
least
was
not
intentionally
a
good
samaritan
he
had
halted
not
for
the
purpose
of
resting
his
men
but
because
he
was
fogged
as
to
his
whereabouts
the
night
was
inky
black
the
country
hills
deep
depressions
and
thick
the
colonel
relying
implicitly
on
the
guidance
of
his
intelligence
officer
whom
he
supposed
had
made
himself
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
locality
found
himself
obviously
going
astray
he
should
now
be
at
a
railway
bridge
which
was
six
miles
from
the
village
of
etigny
the
last
landmark
but
no
such
bridge
as
far
as
he
could
judge
was
anywhere
near
and
lambert
the
intelligence
officer
on
being
questioned
admitted
he
did
not
exactly
know
where
they
were
that
is
why
the
colonel
had
halted
his
object
was
to
make
a
flank
attack
on
the
german
outposts
who
were
supposed
to
be
in
hiding
in
a
wood
some
three
miles
to
the
south
of
where
the
extreme
right
of
their
main
army
lay
and
obviously
it
was
of
no
use
advancing
any
further
until
he
had
ascertained
the
direction
in
which
he
must
steer
in
this
wood
was
a
cottage
that
had
been
enlarged
and
fortified
and
hitherto
used
as
a
place
of
internment
and
hospital
for
english
prisoners
until
they
could
be
transported
to
potsdam
reports
had
reached
the
english
that
the
germans
intended
killing
all
their
prisoners
if
compelled
to
evacuate
and
so
the
were
to
endeavour
to
rescue
these
prisoners
whilst
at
the
same
time
outflanking
and
cutting
off
the
german
outposts
the
movement
had
of
course
to
be
in
the
nature
of
an
entire
surprise
and
the
hospital
to
be
rushed
if
possible
without
any
firing
according
to
lambert
the
wood
was
about
one
mile
due
east
of
the
railway
bridge
and
there
was
a
tiny
path
near
a
mill
on
the
outskirts
of
it
that
led
to
the
rear
of
the
cottage
to
miss
this
path
would
be
dangerous
as
the
wood
elsewhere
was
covered
with
morass
and
full
of
quarries
well
lambert
the
colonel
said
you
have
led
us
into
a
deuced
rotten
hole
and
you
must
get
us
out
of
it
somehow
surely
you
have
some
idea
of
our
lambert
peered
again
into
the
darkness
and
shook
his
head
on
a
night
like
this
he
argued
it
is
easy
to
make
mistakes
we
must
have
come
much
further
to
the
west
than
i
well
then
we
had
better
veer
round
and
make
for
the
extreme
east
the
colonel
said
tartly
would
it
not
be
as
well
to
return
to
etigny
sir
the
adjutant
suggested
what
six
all
that
with
our
men
already
pretty
well
exhausted
the
colonel
retorted
angrily
no
that
is
utterly
out
of
the
question
lambert
has
brought
us
here
and
egad
he
must
take
us
on
to
our
lambert
took
a
few
paces
into
the
darkness
and
was
again
peering
round
when
a
young
lieutenant
approached
the
colonel
and
saluted
if
you
please
sir
he
said
a
man
has
just
arrived
who
says
he
will
act
as
our
a
man
a
german
i
suppose
you
mean
what
language
does
he
speak
english
at
least
in
part
he
is
a
scot
shall
i
bring
him
to
you
the
colonel
gave
a
gruff
assent
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
subaltern
returned
followed
by
a
tall
figure
enveloped
in
a
long
black
cloak
with
one
accord
the
colonel
the
adjutant
and
lambert
all
swung
round
and
eyed
him
curiously
who
and
what
are
you
demanded
the
colonel
i
m
an
inhabitant
of
these
parts
the
stranger
answered
and
i
have
come
to
offer
you
my
services
as
you
re
in
the
pay
of
the
germans
of
course
the
colonel
retorted
sharply
how
did
you
know
we
wanted
a
guide
i
overheard
your
what
the
colonel
cried
furiously
you
have
been
listening
to
what
we
were
saying
take
him
away
anderson
and
have
him
shot
at
no
one
moved
a
sort
of
spell
stole
over
lambert
the
adjutant
and
anderson
and
held
them
rooted
to
the
ground
the
colonel
repeated
his
order
and
was
about
to
lay
hands
on
the
stranger
himself
when
the
latter
waved
him
back
in
an
emergency
like
this
colonel
he
said
you
must
take
what
providence
sends
you
i
am
no
more
a
german
spy
than
is
your
son
alec
who
is
probably
at
the
present
moment
returning
from
an
afternoon
s
march
out
with
the
at
great
heavens
the
colonel
gasped
how
do
you
know
i
have
a
son
alec
and
that
he
is
at
cheltenham
who
are
you
sir
a
renegade
no
colonel
i
m
not
came
the
reply
i
m
someone
in
whom
you
can
place
perfect
confidence
trust
yourself
to
me
and
i
will
conduct
you
at
once
to
the
cottage
in
the
it
s
very
extraordinary
i
don
t
for
the
life
of
me
know
what
to
make
of
it
the
colonel
muttered
turning
to
the
group
of
officers
by
his
side
what
do
you
advise
lambert
under
the
circumstances
sir
lambert
replied
slowly
i
should
trust
him
you
can
have
him
shot
if
he
leads
us
that
s
true
the
colonel
murmured
and
turning
to
the
stranger
did
you
hear
what
major
lambert
said
i
can
have
you
shot
if
you
lead
us
astray
and
by
jove
i
will
take
your
position
at
the
head
of
the
column
if
we
are
successful
i
will
see
that
you
are
adequately
rewarded
if
you
betray
die
do
you
understand
i
do
colonel
the
stranger
replied
and
i
accept
your
conditions
he
stepped
back
and
at
a
signal
from
the
colonel
followed
lieutenant
anderson
to
the
head
of
the
column
a
sergeant
and
a
old
and
tried
up
their
positions
a
pace
or
two
behind
him
and
at
a
word
from
the
colonel
the
whole
battalion
was
once
more
on
the
move
on
and
on
they
went
a
dull
tramp
tramp
tramp
but
in
a
completely
different
direction
from
the
one
in
which
they
had
previously
been
going
it
was
all
so
pitch
dark
that
the
corporal
and
the
sergeant
had
to
keep
very
close
to
the
stranger
to
see
him
he
marches
just
like
one
of
us
the
sergeant
whispered
and
yet
i
kenna
hear
the
sound
of
his
feet
what
do
you
make
of
him
i
don
t
know
the
corporal
replied
i
seem
to
know
him
and
yet
i
haven
t
seen
a
feature
of
his
face
something
about
him
reminds
me
of
the
night
i
escaped
from
it
strikes
me
sergeant
that
the
cottage
the
colonel
is
after
is
the
very
one
in
which
we
took
then
you
know
the
way
nae
corporal
findlay
replied
i
was
too
rushed
and
scared
that
night
to
remember
much
the
only
thing
i
can
remember
seeing
plainly
is
those
two
corpses
swinging
from
the
mackay
s
and
the
gude
wife
the
scene
comes
back
to
me
vividly
now
as
i
look
at
this
guide
of
ours
why
i
dinna
be
ready
to
shoot
him
mon
the
instant
there
s
treachery
the
sergeant
whispered
aye
aye
corporal
findlay
replied
tapping
the
barrel
of
his
rifle
knowingly
he
ll
nae
want
a
second
on
and
on
they
tramped
till
presently
they
forsook
the
highway
for
a
field
and
then
plunging
down
and
down
eventually
found
themselves
upon
level
ground
facing
some
trees
this
is
the
wood
the
guide
observed
and
here
is
the
path
after
we
have
travelled
along
it
in
indian
file
and
on
tiptoe
for
two
miles
we
shall
emerge
into
a
small
clearing
where
a
low
mud
wall
overtopped
by
a
machine
gun
will
confront
us
the
soldiers
supposed
to
be
on
duty
there
have
been
drinking
red
wine
all
day
and
are
now
sleeping
if
you
approach
noiselessly
you
will
be
able
to
climb
the
wall
and
take
them
by
surprise
the
cottage
is
then
but
there
are
sentries
in
the
one
he
will
be
leaning
on
his
rifle
dozing
you
must
creep
up
to
him
and
settle
him
before
he
has
time
to
make
a
sound
i
will
tell
you
when
we
approach
the
guide
advanced
and
the
whole
battalion
of
stalked
along
behind
him
i
shall
be
gay
glad
when
this
job
is
over
corporal
findlay
murmured
i
would
as
soon
spend
the
night
in
a
however
although
every
now
and
then
a
rustling
of
leaves
that
heralded
a
rabbit
made
them
start
and
the
ominous
screech
of
an
owl
caused
the
hair
on
the
scalp
of
more
than
one
superstitious
celt
to
bristle
so
far
there
was
no
real
cause
for
alarm
and
on
and
on
the
battalion
stole
at
last
their
guide
halted
and
every
man
behind
him
instantly
followed
suit
he
whispered
to
corporal
findlay
and
the
sergeant
and
making
way
to
let
them
pass
kept
close
to
their
heels
guiding
them
by
what
appeared
to
be
a
minute
bull
lantern
on
turning
a
sharp
bend
in
the
path
corporal
findlay
and
the
sergeant
saw
the
sentry
as
their
guide
had
described
him
asleep
and
before
he
had
time
to
awake
corporal
findlay
had
dashed
him
to
the
ground
with
a
swinging
blow
from
the
of
his
rifle
three
minutes
later
and
the
head
of
the
column
found
itself
facing
the
mud
wall
and
the
this
was
the
critical
moment
if
their
guide
meant
mischief
now
was
his
opportunity
following
closely
at
his
heels
their
rifle
and
revolver
at
his
head
the
sergeant
and
corporal
crept
up
to
the
wall
and
one
by
one
the
rest
of
the
filed
into
the
open
space
after
them
holding
their
breath
the
highlanders
laid
hold
of
the
top
of
the
wall
then
with
a
sudden
stoop
they
swung
themselves
upwards
the
sleeping
sentinels
awoke
but
only
to
feel
one
short
sharp
the
pangs
of
death
the
outer
position
won
the
highlanders
next
turned
their
attention
to
the
cottage
and
the
enclosed
space
in
front
of
it
there
a
strong
body
of
german
infantry
were
stationed
and
as
they
came
rushing
out
to
meet
the
intruders
they
shared
the
same
fate
as
their
companions
in
ten
minutes
there
was
not
a
german
left
alive
and
the
their
bayonets
dripping
with
blood
were
busy
liberating
the
english
prisoners
when
it
was
all
over
and
the
colonel
and
his
staff
were
sitting
down
in
the
front
parlour
of
the
cottage
enjoying
some
refreshment
colonel
suddenly
remembered
the
guide
anderson
he
said
fetch
that
here
it
s
not
very
gracious
behaviour
on
our
part
to
leave
him
outside
for
egad
if
it
had
not
been
for
him
we
should
not
be
where
we
are
moreover
i
want
to
see
ve
an
idea
he
s
someone
i
the
subaltern
departed
and
after
an
interval
of
some
minutes
returned
followed
only
by
corporal
findlay
hulloa
exclaimed
the
colonel
looking
up
sharply
from
his
meal
this
is
not
the
man
i
wanted
where
is
he
if
you
please
sir
the
subaltern
said
in
a
voice
full
of
suppressed
excitement
corporal
findlay
can
tell
you
all
about
was
the
last
to
see
the
last
to
see
him
growled
the
colonel
why
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
where
is
he
i
can
t
say
sir
corporal
findlay
began
after
the
fight
was
over
i
followed
him
into
this
cottage
right
into
this
room
and
he
halted
just
where
you
are
sitting
under
that
beam
and
he
pointed
to
the
great
white
rafter
immediately
over
the
colonel
s
head
he
then
turned
round
sir
and
drawing
aside
the
cloak
that
had
hitherto
hidden
his
face
showed
himself
to
me
good
god
man
you
needn
t
look
so
frightened
the
colonel
cried
he
wasn
t
the
devil
was
he
no
sir
he
wasn
t
the
devil
corporal
findlay
responded
he
was
sergeant
mackay
of
the
first
the
last
time
i
had
set
eyes
on
him
was
in
this
room
on
the
night
of
the
retreat
from
when
i
and
several
others
of
the
found
him
hanging
from
that
and
then
said
the
colonel
after
a
long
pause
and
then
what
happened
why
sir
corporal
findlay
replied
he
smiled
as
if
something
had
pleased
him
mightily
and
waving
his
and
you
expect
me
to
believe
such
a
cock
and
bull
story
as
that
the
colonel
said
slowly
it
s
the
truth
sir
corporal
findlay
said
slowly
sergeant
scott
can
corroborate
it
for
he
was
with
me
all
the
there
s
no
need
to
do
that
the
colonel
answered
for
i
know
you
have
spoken
the
truth
this
is
by
no
means
my
first
experience
with
goodness
sake
do
you
and
sergeant
scott
say
nothing
about
it
to
the
other
men
if
you
do
there
won
t
be
an
ounce
of
nerves
left
among
them
by
the
morning
germans
are
one
thing
but
ghosts
another
it
was
a
splendid
revenge
for
sergeant
mackay
the
stories
i
have
just
narrated
must
be
taken
for
what
they
are
worth
though
i
believe
they
were
told
me
in
good
faith
i
can
not
vouch
for
them
chapter
xvii
a
case
from
japan
since
japan
is
a
country
in
which
i
believe
many
people
are
intensely
interested
i
do
not
think
i
need
apologise
for
introducing
here
the
following
account
of
a
japanese
haunting
never
having
been
to
japan
i
can
not
lay
claim
to
having
had
any
ghostly
adventures
there
myself
but
as
this
is
copied
word
for
word
from
the
mss
of
salis
which
was
very
kindly
lent
me
for
the
purpose
by
salis
salis
s
mother
i
can
most
certainly
answer
for
its
authenticity
in
the
spring
of
i
settled
in
the
village
of
akaji
in
the
southern
island
of
japan
in
order
to
work
a
colliery
the
country
in
this
part
is
mountainous
and
quite
off
the
track
of
any
tourists
and
the
inhabitants
remain
in
a
very
primitive
condition
all
the
people
are
either
farmers
miners
or
the
keepers
of
very
small
shops
and
there
is
not
a
single
hotel
nor
even
an
inn
i
stayed
at
first
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
a
farm
house
and
after
a
little
while
was
able
to
lease
an
old
thatched
farm
house
standing
in
a
small
orange
orchard
quite
close
to
the
colliery
its
owner
lived
in
a
little
house
at
the
back
my
house
was
but
very
high
the
pitch
of
the
thick
thatch
being
very
steep
on
entering
one
found
a
kitchen
with
various
cooking
places
but
no
chimneys
the
smoke
curling
and
losing
itself
among
the
huge
rafters
that
supported
the
roof
the
rest
of
the
house
was
raised
and
consisted
of
four
rooms
divided
from
each
other
by
sliding
screens
or
fusuma
and
with
thick
padded
straw
mats
or
tatami
on
the
floor
i
got
a
table
and
chair
and
put
up
some
book
shelves
and
made
the
best
room
as
habitable
as
possible
this
room
had
a
tokonoma
or
recess
painted
a
dark
grey
and
a
scroll
a
crystal
and
a
vase
of
flowers
put
in
it
gave
the
necessary
decoration
to
the
severely
bare
interior
for
the
first
few
months
i
slept
in
one
of
the
back
rooms
but
later
when
it
got
very
hot
i
only
used
the
one
room
i
had
one
servant
and
as
we
got
up
at
dawn
we
also
went
to
sleep
very
early
and
usually
by
nine
o
clock
the
house
was
in
darkness
and
silence
one
night
i
was
awakened
and
heard
talking
and
laughing
in
the
next
room
only
separated
from
me
by
a
thin
screen
someone
was
telling
a
story
in
an
animated
voice
and
his
auditor
every
now
and
then
ejaculated
naruhode
to
be
sure
and
sodesuka
is
that
so
but
the
voices
were
kept
low
and
the
laughs
were
subdued
just
then
the
kitchen
clock
struck
two
i
was
annoyed
at
my
servant
having
friends
in
at
that
hour
and
in
the
room
next
mine
and
determining
to
have
it
out
with
him
in
the
morning
i
fell
asleep
next
morning
he
absolutely
denied
that
anyone
had
been
in
the
house
and
became
very
indignant
when
i
insisted
on
what
i
had
heard
two
nights
later
i
again
heard
a
conversation
going
on
and
reluctantly
got
out
of
bed
and
from
under
the
mosquito
curtains
to
investigate
a
low
chuckling
laugh
and
then
a
snatch
of
i
pushed
back
the
sliding
fusuma
the
room
was
in
darkness
but
i
had
a
little
electric
torch
which
i
used
in
the
colliery
and
pressing
its
button
the
room
was
brightly
lit
inside
the
mosquito
curtain
tanaka
lay
soundly
one
else
was
in
the
room
indeed
but
for
the
futon
or
mattress
covered
by
the
net
it
was
completely
bare
and
the
talking
still
went
on
seeming
now
to
come
from
the
room
behind
me
i
awoke
tanaka
and
we
went
out
into
the
garden
no
one
was
stirring
and
the
sounds
came
from
inside
the
house
away
down
the
road
three
miners
were
returning
from
a
night
shift
and
my
servant
wanted
to
run
and
fetch
them
but
i
did
not
see
the
object
of
doing
so
the
mosquitoes
were
very
bad
and
i
wanted
to
get
back
under
the
nets
conversations
or
no
conversations
and
so
we
the
house
silence
reigned
and
i
went
back
to
not
to
the
remainder
of
that
night
tanaka
took
the
opportunity
while
i
was
at
the
colliery
the
next
morning
to
pack
up
his
few
belongings
and
decamp
leaving
a
letter
saying
he
could
not
stay
in
a
house
frequented
by
demons
i
got
a
girl
in
from
the
village
as
a
makeshift
and
afterwards
another
servant
but
no
one
would
stay
in
the
house
after
nightfall
i
moved
my
bed
into
a
room
at
the
back
but
still
used
the
other
room
as
a
living
room
and
soon
became
used
to
the
fact
that
it
was
haunted
often
during
the
day
there
were
noises
coming
from
near
the
tokonoma
or
though
someone
was
cracking
his
finger
joints
a
habit
the
japanese
have
on
several
occasions
flowers
put
in
the
vase
below
the
hanging
scroll
were
taken
out
of
their
vase
and
arranged
lying
on
a
tray
one
afternoon
i
brought
my
bed
into
the
room
as
the
autumn
was
now
getting
cold
and
i
had
been
unwell
for
some
days
and
wanted
the
benefit
of
the
afternoon
sun
i
sent
the
servant
to
buy
some
stamps
at
the
post
office
a
mile
away
and
stepped
into
the
garden
to
gather
some
late
dahlias
looking
up
i
distinctly
saw
a
movement
in
the
room
i
had
left
through
the
pane
of
glass
let
into
the
shoji
dropping
my
flowers
i
pressed
my
face
against
the
pane
and
saw
the
bedclothes
which
the
servant
and
myself
had
arranged
only
five
minutes
previously
had
been
whisked
off
and
were
lying
on
the
floor
twice
after
this
coats
hung
on
a
peg
near
the
tokonoma
were
found
almost
immediately
lying
on
the
floor
at
some
distance
one
having
been
pulled
from
its
peg
with
such
force
as
partly
to
tear
it
on
many
nights
when
i
woke
up
i
heard
talking
in
the
next
room
and
gradually
came
to
distinguish
a
man
s
voice
sometimes
i
thought
two
men
s
and
certainly
that
of
a
woman
and
a
baby
all
the
village
were
now
talking
of
the
haunted
house
and
now
and
then
neighbours
came
in
to
listen
to
the
mysterious
sounds
that
came
from
time
to
time
from
the
tokonoma
but
they
took
good
care
to
be
gone
before
sunset
winter
had
now
come
and
i
fell
ill
and
as
the
only
really
pleasant
room
in
the
house
was
made
impossible
during
the
long
sleepless
nights
i
redoubled
my
endeavour
to
find
another
house
a
baby
s
wailings
were
very
distinct
then
it
was
hushed
by
its
mother
and
then
long
conversations
ensued
between
her
and
one
or
two
there
were
little
taps
as
though
a
tobacco
pipe
were
being
emptied
of
its
ashes
but
more
often
a
curious
noise
was
heard
which
sounded
like
putter
about
this
time
an
account
appeared
in
all
the
japanese
newspapers
of
a
bridge
in
tokejo
which
was
haunted
by
a
woman
and
how
this
spirit
had
been
laid
by
priestly
intervention
and
it
was
suggested
that
the
same
might
be
tried
in
the
present
case
i
thought
it
rather
a
good
plan
but
seeing
that
it
was
rather
expensive
said
that
the
landlord
and
not
his
foreign
tenant
should
defray
the
cost
and
arrange
the
matter
but
my
landlord
who
was
very
unpopular
in
the
village
and
with
whom
i
was
not
on
very
good
terms
would
do
nothing
and
as
just
then
another
house
near
the
colliery
became
vacant
i
was
able
to
move
and
so
at
last
be
free
of
my
ghostly
visitants
everyone
knew
of
the
reason
for
my
leaving
and
the
landlord
felt
sure
he
would
never
find
another
tenant
after
the
house
had
been
empty
for
some
time
the
landlord
himself
determined
to
live
in
it
for
some
months
in
order
to
demonstrate
that
things
were
not
so
bad
after
all
he
and
his
wife
and
their
two
grandchildren
accordingly
moved
their
things
across
from
their
other
house
but
did
not
at
first
occupy
the
room
with
the
tokonoma
seeing
however
that
their
object
in
being
in
the
house
at
all
would
be
defeated
unless
this
room
was
used
they
hung
some
pictures
in
the
recess
placed
a
bronze
flower
vase
on
a
carved
stand
below
them
and
also
moved
in
a
gilt
shrine
containing
an
image
of
buddha
a
few
friends
were
asked
in
but
all
left
at
sunset
next
morning
i
heard
that
there
had
been
considerable
disturbance
at
the
house
and
that
the
younger
grandson
had
been
taken
with
convulsions
the
same
day
a
move
was
made
again
to
their
former
abode
the
house
was
closed
and
still
remains
empty
a
temple
on
a
hill
near
by
was
being
repaired
and
on
the
completion
of
the
work
a
priest
came
to
hold
a
service
the
head
man
of
the
village
took
the
opportunity
of
consulting
with
him
and
together
they
went
to
see
my
late
landlord
the
facts
brought
to
light
many
of
which
were
vaguely
known
in
the
district
are
as
follows
house
had
been
built
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
previously
by
the
head
of
the
family
which
was
then
of
more
consequence
than
at
present
although
it
still
owned
considerable
property
in
pine
forests
and
rice
fields
a
younger
brother
of
the
original
builder
had
conspired
against
his
feudal
lord
and
had
committed
it
was
not
known
in
which
room
but
probably
it
was
in
the
principal
one
the
next
tragedy
that
was
known
of
had
happened
some
fifteen
years
before
when
the
the
father
of
the
two
boys
already
mentioned
was
found
hanging
from
a
hook
near
the
wooden
ceiling
of
the
room
with
the
tokonoma
he
had
been
away
for
some
time
in
tokejo
had
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
and
on
his
return
had
quarrelled
violently
with
his
wife
she
had
run
out
of
the
house
with
her
children
and
had
stayed
on
the
hillside
all
night
next
morning
her
husband
was
found
as
above
stated
some
months
later
again
in
the
same
room
on
the
eve
of
the
birth
of
her
posthumous
child
this
woman
killed
herself
by
drinking
poison
made
from
the
leaves
of
a
shrub
still
growing
in
the
garden
during
the
convulsions
which
preceded
her
death
the
child
was
born
but
dead
the
priest
said
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
spirits
of
these
various
people
related
by
family
ties
and
lives
passed
among
the
same
surroundings
and
who
had
all
come
to
a
dreadful
violent
end
in
the
same
house
and
probably
the
same
room
were
earthbound
and
were
in
the
habit
of
assembling
and
conversing
in
the
room
where
their
lives
had
come
to
an
end
each
addition
would
strengthen
and
intensify
their
bondage
and
the
priest
expressed
his
surprise
that
the
spirits
were
not
actually
visible
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
as
to
the
terms
for
a
service
and
ceremony
to
free
the
house
from
these
ghostly
tenants
and
to
give
them
rest
i
offered
a
small
sum
but
as
they
were
after
all
the
relations
of
the
landlord
it
was
upon
him
that
the
bulk
of
the
expense
fell
and
he
refused
to
provide
the
necessary
funds
his
argument
was
that
even
were
the
spirits
laid
no
one
now
would
rent
the
house
and
so
he
would
not
spend
any
money
on
it
whether
he
also
thought
that
the
spirits
were
as
happy
holding
their
round
the
tokonoma
as
they
would
be
if
they
were
at
rest
he
did
not
say
as
such
thoughts
would
be
contrary
to
all
japanese
ideas
on
the
subject
anyway
the
house
is
now
closed
the
heavy
wooden
shutters
are
rolled
across
the
verandahs
and
bolted
the
garden
is
overgrown
and
choked
with
weeds
and
the
only
time
when
there
is
human
activity
about
it
is
when
the
orange
trees
burdened
with
fruit
yield
their
golden
harvest
g
to
revert
again
to
my
own
experiences
i
am
often
sorry
extremely
sorry
i
was
ever
brought
into
contact
with
the
unknown
as
i
said
in
one
of
the
early
chapters
of
this
book
i
did
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
the
came
to
me
and
it
has
never
given
me
any
peace
i
feel
its
presence
beside
me
at
all
times
in
the
evening
when
i
am
writing
the
curtains
that
are
tightly
drawn
across
the
closed
windows
slowly
bulge
the
candlestick
on
the
rattles
a
picture
on
the
wall
swings
out
suddenly
at
me
and
when
i
go
to
bed
and
try
to
sleep
i
frequently
hear
breathings
and
whispers
some
of
these
presences
no
doubt
have
been
with
me
probably
they
were
with
my
others
have
attached
themselves
to
me
in
my
nocturnal
ramblings
my
wife
who
was
a
confirmed
disbeliever
before
our
marriage
has
long
since
thrown
aside
her
scepticism
and
for
a
good
reason
she
has
had
many
startling
proofs
of
the
power
the
spirit
has
of
making
itself
manifest
the
night
a
near
relative
of
mine
died
both
she
and
i
heard
a
loud
crash
on
the
panel
of
our
bedroom
door
and
i
though
i
only
saw
a
hooded
figure
standing
there
also
besides
having
heard
the
banshee
my
wife
has
seen
objects
moved
by
superphysical
agency
seen
them
fanned
by
a
wind
that
is
apparently
had
small
stones
and
other
articles
thrown
at
her
and
heard
all
sorts
of
queer
unaccountable
sighs
and
moans
three
ghostly
incidents
have
happened
to
me
within
the
past
twelve
months
the
first
was
in
red
lion
square
it
was
twilight
i
was
alone
on
the
top
floor
of
the
house
and
no
one
else
was
in
the
building
saving
the
daughter
of
the
caretaker
who
was
in
the
basement
suddenly
footsteps
slow
ponderous
footsteps
began
to
ascend
the
being
uncarpetted
and
of
oak
carried
the
the
hall
wondering
who
it
could
be
i
called
out
there
was
no
reply
and
the
steps
drew
nearer
on
the
landing
immediately
beneath
me
they
halted
i
went
out
and
looked
down
no
one
was
to
be
seen
and
the
steps
immediately
began
to
descend
i
followed
them
right
few
stairs
they
reached
the
hall
when
they
abruptly
ceased
i
learned
afterwards
that
these
footsteps
were
quite
a
common
phenomenon
in
the
house
which
had
long
been
haunted
by
them
my
second
experience
occurred
in
the
moscow
road
bayswater
feeling
a
heavy
weight
on
my
bed
one
night
and
wishing
to
remove
it
i
put
out
my
hand
it
was
immediately
seized
and
held
in
a
warm
grip
i
sat
up
in
bed
but
could
see
no
one
the
hand
that
clasped
mine
was
very
soft
and
that
of
a
woman
i
felt
the
wrist
and
forearm
but
beyond
the
elbow
there
was
nothing
i
was
rather
alarmed
at
this
occurrence
at
the
time
as
i
have
a
friend
who
died
shortly
after
experiencing
a
similar
phenomenon
in
my
case
however
the
lady
whose
hand
i
immediately
identified
as
the
hand
that
had
clasped
mine
and
this
lady
solemnly
declared
that
upon
the
same
compared
had
dreamed
of
a
hand
which
was
the
exact
counterpart
of
mine
and
that
upon
shaking
hands
with
me
that
afternoon
she
had
been
instantly
reminded
of
her
dream
that
there
was
nothing
in
common
between
us
her
tastes
and
outlook
on
life
being
absolutely
at
variance
with
mine
makes
the
occurrence
in
my
opinion
none
the
less
interesting
though
somewhat
difficult
to
account
for
my
last
experience
occurred
only
a
few
days
ago
as
i
was
sitting
on
the
stairs
of
a
haunted
house
near
ealing
i
had
applied
to
the
landlord
for
permission
to
spend
the
night
there
and
pending
his
reply
had
obtained
the
keys
from
the
agent
in
order
to
see
what
the
house
was
like
by
daylight
having
just
finished
jotting
down
some
memorandum
of
something
i
had
suddenly
thought
paused
still
holding
the
pencil
in
my
hand
whilst
my
lay
open
on
my
knee
i
had
not
sat
thus
for
more
than
a
minute
when
with
a
thrill
of
surprise
i
felt
the
pencil
suddenly
taken
from
my
hand
and
looking
down
i
distinctly
saw
it
of
its
own
accord
scrawl
right
across
my
book
whether
what
i
afterwards
found
written
in
my
was
written
by
the
spirit
that
haunted
the
house
or
by
a
projection
of
one
of
my
own
personalities
i
can
not
say
neither
can
i
myself
nor
anyone
to
whom
i
have
shown
the
symbolic
writing
tell
what
it
means
the
appended
is
a
facsimile
illustration
i
might
add
that
this
is
my
one
and
only
experience
of
and
also
that
it
was
my
one
and
only
experience
in
the
haunted
house
near
ealing
as
i
did
not
succeed
in
getting
leave
to
spend
a
night
there
although
i
must
confess
i
have
made
little
progress
so
far
in
my
investigations
for
my
failure
to
decipher
is
not
the
only
that
i
have
encountered
i
still
have
hopes
i
hope
that
some
day
when
i
am
brought
face
to
face
with
the
unknown
in
a
haunted
house
or
elsewhere
i
may
be
able
to
hit
upon
some
mode
of
communication
with
it
and
discover
something
that
may
be
of
real
service
both
to
myself
and
to
the
rest
of
humanity
if
only
i
could
overcome
fear
it
is
march
midnight
and
as
i
pen
these
concluding
words
my
mind
reverts
to
the
symbols
and
the
twelve
o
clock
suddenly
i
hear
footsteps
on
the
road
in
the
direction
of
the
house
i
glance
at
my
wife
wondering
whether
she
hears
them
too
she
is
asleep
however
and
as
i
covertly
watch
her
i
see
a
look
of
terror
gradually
steal
into
her
face
clicking
steps
they
come
nearer
and
nearer
they
stop
for
a
moment
at
our
door
and
slowly
on
i
look
out
of
the
road
is
absolutely
deserted
but
from
close
at
hand
the
sounds
are
wafted
to
click
click
fainter
fainter
they
abruptly
cease

end
