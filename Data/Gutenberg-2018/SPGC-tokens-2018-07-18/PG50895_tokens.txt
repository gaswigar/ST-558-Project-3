introduction
in
the
city
of
glasgow
there
is
a
for
women
known
as
the
here
the
vagrant
can
get
a
nightly
bunk
for
a
few
pence
and
no
female
is
refused
admittance
the
unfortunate
the
sick
and
congregate
under
the
same
roof
breathe
the
same
fetid
air
and
forget
the
troubles
of
a
miserable
existence
in
strong
drink
the
solace
of
the
sorrowful
or
in
heavy
stupor
the
slumber
of
the
toilworn
the
underworld
of
which
i
have
seen
and
known
such
a
lot
has
always
appeared
to
me
as
a
greater
where
human
beings
pinched
and
and
ground
down
with
a
weight
of
oppression
are
hemmed
up
like
the
in
a
it
is
in
this
larger
sense
that
i
have
chosen
the
name
for
the
title
of
norah
ryan
s
story
by
committing
the
great
sin
and
subsequently
by
allowing
the
dictates
of
motherhood
to
triumph
over
decrees
of
society
she
became
a
pariah
eternally
doomed
to
the
greater
whilst
my
former
book
children
of
the
dead
end
was
on
the
whole
accepted
as
giving
a
picture
of
the
life
of
the
navvy
there
were
some
who
refused
to
believe
that
scenes
such
as
i
strove
to
depict
could
exist
in
a
country
like
ours
to
them
i
venture
the
assurance
that
the
is
a
transcript
from
life
and
that
most
of
the
characters
are
real
people
and
the
scenes
only
too
poignantly
true
some
may
think
that
such
things
should
not
be
written
about
but
public
opinion
like
the
light
of
day
is
a
great
purifier
and
to
hide
a
sore
from
the
surgeon
s
eye
out
of
miscalled
delicacy
is
surely
a
supreme
folly
a
word
about
children
of
the
dead
i
am
highly
gratified
by
the
success
attained
by
that
book
in
britain
and
abroad
only
in
ireland
my
native
country
has
the
book
given
offence
reviewers
there
spoke
angrily
about
it
and
one
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
i
would
end
my
days
by
blowing
out
my
brains
with
a
revolver
the
reference
to
a
tyrannical
village
priest
gave
great
offence
to
a
number
of
clergy
but
on
the
other
hand
several
wrote
to
me
speaking
very
highly
of
the
book
and
i
have
been
told
that
a
roman
catholic
bishop
sat
up
all
night
to
read
it
in
my
own
place
i
am
looked
upon
with
suspicion
all
because
i
wrote
a
book
a
bad
one
makin
fun
of
the
priest
as
an
old
countryman
remarked
to
me
last
summer
when
i
was
at
home
you
don
t
like
it
then
i
said
like
it
i
wouldn
t
read
it
for
a
hundred
pounds
money

round

with
a

and
your
brown
penny
for

it

the

so
you
d

i
m
off
and
away
two
voices
were
speaking
inside
a
cabin
on
the
coast
of
donegal
the
season
was
the
time
an
hour
before
the
dawn
of
a
cheerless
morning
within
the
hovel
there
was
neither
light
nor
warmth
the
rushlight
had
gone
out
and
the
turf
piled
on
the
hearth
refused
to
burn
outside
a
gale
was
blowing
the
door
flimsy
and
fractured
creaked
complainingly
on
its
leathern
hinges
the
panes
of
the
and
only
window
were
broken
the
rags
that
had
taken
their
places
had
been
blown
in
during
the
night
and
the
sleet
carried
by
the
wind
struck
heavily
on
the
earthen
floor
in
the
corner
of
the
hut
a
woman
coughed
violently
expending
all
the
breath
in
her
body
then
followed
a
struggle
for
air
for
renewed
life
and
a
battle
against
sickness
or
death
went
on
in
the
darkness
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
a
voice
speaking
in
gaelic
could
be
heard
again
are
you
away
norah
i
am
just
going
mother
i
am
stopping
the
window
to
keep
the
cold
away
from
god
bless
you
child
came
the
answer
the
men
are
not
coming
in
yet
are
they
i
don
t
hear
their
step
now
the
window
is
all
right
are
you
warm
middling
alannah
did
you
take
the
milk
for
your
breakfast
i
left
some
for
you
in
the
jug
came
the
reply
will
you
take
it
now
that
is
always
the
way
with
you
norah
said
the
woman
in
a
querulous
voice
you
never
take
your
meals
but
always
leave
them
for
somebody
else
and
you
are
getting
thinner
on
it
every
day
i
don
t
want
anything
for
i
am
not
hungry
these
days
and
maybe
it
is
god
himself
that
put
the
sickness
on
me
so
that
i
would
not
take
away
the
food
of
them
that
needs
it
more
than
i
do
drink
the
milk
norah
it
will
do
you
there
was
no
answer
a
little
girl
lifted
the
latch
of
the
door
and
looked
timorously
out
into
the
cold
and
the
blackness
the
gale
caught
her
and
for
a
moment
she
almost
choked
for
breath
it
was
still
intensely
dark
no
colour
of
the
day
was
yet
in
the
sky
the
wind
whistled
shrilly
round
the
corners
of
the
cabin
and
a
bird
dropped
to
the
ground
in
front
of
the
child
she
looked
back
into
the
gloomy
interior
of
the
cabin
and
for
a
moment
thought
of
returning
she
was
very
hungry
but
remembered
her
father
and
brother
who
would
presently
come
in
from
the
fishing
probably
as
they
had
come
in
for
days
with
empty
boats
and
empty
stomachs
another
fit
of
coughing
seized
the
mother
and
the
girl
went
out
shutting
the
door
carefully
behind
her
to
stay
the
wrath
of
the
wind
which
swept
violently
across
the
floor
of
the
house
the
sea
was
near
the
tide
sweeping
sullenly
away
from
the
shore
moaned
plaintively
near
the
land
and
swelled
into
loud
discordant
wrath
far
out
at
the
bar
all
round
the
house
a
tremulous
gray
haze
enveloped
everything
and
the
child
stole
into
its
mysterious
bosom
and
towards
the
sea
the
sleet
shot
sharply
across
her
body
and
at
times
she
turned
round
to
save
her
face
from
its
stinging
lash
she
was
so
small
so
frail
so
tender
that
she
might
be
swept
away
at
any
moment
as
she
moved
like
a
shadow
through
the
greyness
keeping
a
keen
lookout
for
the
ghosts
that
peopled
the
mists
and
the
lonely
places
of
these
phantoms
she
was
assured
to
her
they
were
as
true
as
her
own
mother
as
her
own
self
they
were
around
and
above
her
they
hid
in
the
mists
walked
on
the
sea
roved
in
the
fields
and
she
was
afraid
of
them
suddenly
she
called
to
mind
the
story
of
the
lone
woman
of
the
mist
the
ghost
whom
all
the
old
people
of
the
locality
had
met
at
some
time
or
another
in
their
lives
even
as
she
thought
an
apparition
took
form
a
lone
woman
stood
in
front
of
the
little
girl
barely
ten
paces
away
the
child
crossed
herself
seven
times
and
walked
straight
ahead
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
figure
that
barred
the
path
this
was
the
only
thing
to
be
done
under
the
steady
look
of
the
eyes
a
ghost
is
powerless
so
her
mother
had
told
her
and
the
girl
knowing
this
never
lowered
her
gaze
but
her
bare
feet
got
suddenly
warm
her
heart
leapt
as
if
wanting
to
leave
her
body
and
the
effort
to
restrain
the
tremor
of
her
eyelids
caused
her
pain
the
ghost
spoke
who
is
the
girsha
a
that
is
out
so
early
came
the
question
it
s
me
norah
ryan
answered
the
child
in
a
glad
voice
i
thought
that
ye
were
the
lone
woman
of
the
mist
or
maybe
a
b
i
m
not
the
beanshee
i
m
the
beansho
c
the
woman
replied
in
a
sharp
voice
d
ye
know
what
that
means
it
means
that
ye
are
the
woman
i
m
not
to
have
the
civil
word
with
because
ye
ve
committed
a
great
who
said
that
was
it
yer
mother
then
it
was
said
the
child
i
often
heard
her
say
them
d
ye
know
me
sin
then
enquired
the
woman
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
she
went
on
ye
don
t
of
course
this
is
me
sin
girsha
this
is
me
sin
look
at
it
the
woman
loosened
the
shawl
which
was
drawn
tightly
around
her
body
and
disclosed
a
little
child
lying
fast
asleep
in
her
arms
the
wind
caught
the
sleeper
one
tiny
hand
quivered
in
mute
protest
then
the
infant
awoke
and
roared
loudly
the
mother
kissed
the
wee
thing
hastily
fastened
the
shawl
again
and
strode
forward
taking
long
steps
like
a
man
towards
the
sea
she
was
her
feet
made
a
rustling
sound
on
the
snow
and
two
little
furrows
lay
behind
her
norah
ryan
followed
and
presently
the
older
woman
turned
round
that
s
me
sin
girsha
that
s
me
sin
she
said
that
s
a
sin
that
can
never
be
undone
mind
that
and
mind
it
always
ye
ll
be
goin
into
the
town
i
suppose
that
i
am
said
the
child
is
the
tide
full
on
the
run
now
it
s
nearly
out
see
the
sky
is
clearin
a
bit
and
look
it
there
s
some

t
like
the
stars
good
woman
for
they
re
always
so
cold
lookin
yes
they
re
middlin
like
to
goodly
people
said
the
woman
there
we
re
near
the
sea
and
the
greyness
is
risin
off
the
woman
lifted
her
hand
and
pointed
to
the
rocky
shore
that
skirted
the
bay
at
first
sight
it
appeared
to
be
completely
deserted
nothing
could
be
seen
but
the
leaden
grey
sea
and
the
sharp
and
jagged
rocks
protruding
through
the
snow
that
covered
the
shore
the
tide
was
nearly
out
the
east
was
clearing
but
the
wind
still
lashed
furiously
against
the
legs
and
faces
of
the
woman
and
the
girl
i
suppose
there
ll
be
a
lot
waitin
for
the
tide
said
norah
ryan
and
a
cold
wait
it
ll
be
for
them
too
on
this
mornin
of
all
mornin
it
s
god
s
will
said
the
woman
with
the
child
god
s
will
the
priest
s
will
and
the
will
of
the
yarn
she
spoke
sharply
and
resentfully
and
again
with
long
strides
hurried
forward
to
the
shore
ii
how
lifeless
the
scene
looked
the
hollows
white
with
snow
the
edges
of
the
rocks
darkly
bare
norah
ryan
stepping
timidly
suddenly
shrieked
as
her
foot
slipped
into
a
wreath
of
snow
under
her
tread
something
moved
the
snow
rose
into
the
air
as
if
to
shake
itself
then
fell
again
with
a
crackling
noise
the
girl
had
stepped
upon
a
sleeping
woman
who
now
rudely
wakened
was
afoot
and
angry
mercy
be
on
you
child
roared
the
female
in
gaelic
as
she
shook
the
frozen
flakes
from
the
old
woollen
handkerchief
that
covered
her
head
can
you
not
take
heed
of
your
feet
and
where
you
re
putting
them
it
s
the
child
that
didn
t
see
ye
said
the
beansho
then
added
by
way
of
salutation
it
s
cold
to
be
sleepin
out
this
mornin
it
s
norah
ryan
is
it
asked
the
woman
still
shaking
the
snow
from
her
and
has
she
been
along
with
you
of
all
persons
in
the
world
is
the
tide
out
yet
asked
a
voice
from
the
snow
a
face
like
that
of
a
sheeted
corpse
peered
up
into
the
greyness
and
norah
ryan
looked
at
it
her
face
full
of
a
fright
that
was
not
unmixed
with
childish
curiosity
there
in
the
white
snow
some
asleep
and
some
staring
vacantly
into
the
darkness
lay
a
score
of
women
some
young
some
old
and
all
curled
up
like
sleeping
dogs
nothing
could
be
seen
but
the
faces
coloured
ghastly
silver
in
the
dim
light
of
the
slow
dawn
faces
without
bodies
staring
like
dead
things
from
the
welter
of
snow
an
old
woman
asleep
the
bones
of
her
face
showing
plainly
through
the
sallow
wrinkles
of
the
skin
her
only
tooth
protruding
like
a
fang
and
her
jaw
lowered
as
if
hung
by
a
string
suddenly
coughed
her
cough
was
wheezy
weak
with
age
and
she
awoke
in
the
midst
of
the
heap
of
bodies
she
stood
upright
and
disturbed
the
other
sleepers
in
an
instant
the
hollow
was
alive
voluble
noisy
some
of
the
women
knelt
down
and
said
their
prayers
others
shook
the
snow
from
their
shawls
one
was
humming
a
love
song
and
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
at
the
end
of
every
verse
i
ve
been
travelling
all
night
long
said
an
old
crone
who
had
just
joined
the
party
and
i
thought
that
i
would
not
be
in
time
to
catch
the
tide
it
is
a
long
way
that
i
have
to
come
for
a
bundle
of
yarn
sixteen
miles
and
maybe
it
is
that
i
won
t
get
it
at
the
end
of
my
the
kneeling
women
rose
from
their
knees
and
hurried
towards
the
channel
in
the
bay
now
a
thin
string
of
water
barely
three
yards
in
width
the
wind
piercingly
cold
no
longer
carried
its
burden
of
sleet
and
the
east
icily
clear
waited
almost
in
suspense
for
the
first
tint
of
the
sun
the
soil
black
on
the
foreshore
cracked
underfoot
and
pained
the
women
as
they
walked
none
wore
their
shoes
although
three
or
four
carried
brogues
tied
round
their
necks
most
had
mairteens
double
thick
stockings
on
their
feet
and
these
though
they
retained
a
certain
amount
of
body
heat
kept
out
no
wet
in
front
the
old
woman
all
skin
and
bones
and
more
bones
than
skin
whom
norah
had
wakened
led
the
way
her
breath
steaming
out
into
the
air
and
her
feet
sinking
almost
to
the
knees
at
every
step
from
her
dull
lifeless
look
and
the
weary
eyes
that
accepted
everything
with
fatalistic
calm
it
was
plain
that
she
had
passed
the
greater
part
of
her
years
in
suffering
all
the
women
had
difficulty
with
the
wet
and
shifty
sand
which
when
they
placed
their
feet
heavily
on
one
particular
spot
rose
in
an
instant
to
their
knees
they
floundered
across
pulling
out
one
foot
and
then
another
and
grunting
whenever
they
did
so
norah
ryan
the
child
had
little
difficulty
she
glided
lightly
across
her
feet
barely
sinking
to
the
ankles
who
d
have
thought
that
one
s
spags
could
be
so
troublesome
said
the
beansho
it
almost
seems
like
as
if
i
had
no
end
of
do
you
hear
that
woman
speaking
asked
the
aged
female
who
led
the
way
it
s
ill
luck
that
will
keep
us
company
when
she
s
with
us
her
with
her
wean
you
shouldn
t
fault
me
for
me
sin
said
the
beansho
who
overheard
the
remark
for
there
was
no
effort
made
to
conceal
it
no
but
ye
should
be
thankful
that
it
s
not
yourself
that
carries
the
sun
was
nearing
the
horizon
and
the
women
now
on
the
verge
of
the
channel
dhan
they
called
it
stood
in
silence
looking
at
the
water
it
was
not
at
its
lowest
yet
probably
they
would
have
to
wait
for
five
minutes
maybe
more
and
as
they
waited
they
came
closer
and
closer
to
one
another
for
warmth
the
beansho
stood
a
little
apart
from
the
throng
although
tall
and
angular
she
showed
traces
of
good
looks
which
if
they
had
been
tended
might
have
made
her
beautiful
but
now
her
lips
were
drawn
in
a
thin
hard
line
and
a
set
determined
expression
showed
on
her
face
she
was
and
did
not
even
wear
mairteens
and
carried
no
brogues
her
sole
articles
of
dress
were
a
shawl
which
sufficed
also
for
her
child
a
thick
petticoat
made
of
sackcloth
a
chemise
and
a
blouse
the
wind
constantly
lifted
her
petticoat
and
exposed
her
bare
legs
above
the
knees
some
of
the
women
sniggered
on
seeing
this
but
finally
the
beansho
tightened
her
petticoat
between
her
legs
and
thus
held
it
firmly
that
s
the
way
woman
said
the
old
crone
who
led
the
party
hold
your
dress
tight
tighter
keep
away
from
the
beansho
norah
the
child
looked
up
at
the
old
woman
and
smiled
as
a
child
sometimes
will
when
it
fails
to
understand
the
purport
of
words
that
are
spoken
then
her
teeth
chattered
and
she
looked
down
at
her
feet
which
were
bleeding
and
the
blood
could
be
seen
welling
out
through
the
mairteens
she
shivered
constantly
from
the
cold
and
her
face
was
a
little
drawn
a
little
wistful
and
her
grey
eyes
large
and
soft
were
full
of
a
tender
pity
perhaps
the
pity
was
for
her
mother
who
was
ill
at
home
maybe
for
the
beansho
whom
everyone
disliked
or
maybe
for
herself
the
little
girl
of
twelve
who
was
by
far
the
youngest
member
of
the
party
iii
it
s
time
that
we
were
tryin
to
face
the
water
in
the
name
of
god
said
one
of
the
women
who
supported
herself
against
a
neighbour
s
shoulder
whilst
she
took
off
her
mairteens
there
is
low
tide
all
mairteens
were
taken
off
and
raising
their
petticoats
well
up
and
tying
them
tightly
around
their
waists
they
entered
the
water
the
old
woman
leading
the
party
walked
into
the
icy
sea
placidly
the
others
faltered
a
moment
then
stepped
in
recklessly
and
in
a
second
the
water
was
well
up
to
their
thighs
they
hurried
across
shouting
carelessly
gesticulating
violently
and
laughing
loudly
yet
every
one
of
them
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
woman
in
front
was
on
the
borderland
of
tears
if
they
had
spoken
not
they
would
have
wept
norah
ryan
who
was
the
last
to
enter
the
water
tucked
up
her
dress
and
cast
a
frightened
glance
at
those
in
front
no
one
observed
her
she
lifted
the
dress
higher
and
entered
the
icy
cold
stream
which
chilled
her
to
the
bone
at
each
successive
step
the
rising
water
pained
her
as
a
knife
driven
into
the
flesh
might
pain
her
she
raised
her
eyes
and
noticed
a
woman
looking
back
instantly
norah
dropped
her
clothes
and
the
hem
of
her
petticoat
became
saturated
with
water
what
are
ye
doin
norah
ryan
the
woman
shouted
ye

the
dress
that

takin
ye

the
child
paid
no
heed
with
her
clothes
trailing
in
the
stream
she
walked
across
breast
deep
to
the
other
side
her
garments
were
soaked
when
she
landed
the
old
woman
placid
fatalist
was
pulling
on
her
mairteens
with
skinny
warty
hands
another
was
lacing
her
brogues
a
third
tied
a
rag
round
her
foot
which
had
been
cut
by
a
shell
at
the
bottom
of
the
channel
why
did
ye
let
yer
clothes
drop
into
the
dhan
croaked
the
old
woman
she
asked
out
of
mere
curiosity

suffering

driven
all
feeling
from
her
soul
why
d
ye
ask
that
maire
a
crick

the

ryan
asked
the
beansho
three
ha
pence
a

nothing
less
said
the
girl
and
a
glow
of
pride
suffused
her
face
three
ha
pence
a
day
the
beansho
ejaculated
stooping
down
and
pulling
out
the
gritty
sand
which
had
collected
between
her
toes
just
think
of
that
and
her
only
a
wee
slip
of
a
girl
that
s
one
pound
nineteen
shillin
s
a
year
said
maire
a
crick
reflectively
she
s
as
good
as
old
maire
a
glan
mary
of
the
glen
of
greenanore
who
didn
t
miss
a
stitch
in
a
stockin
and
her
givin
birth
to
the
party
set
off
some
singing
plaintively
one
or
two
talking
and
the
rest
buried
in
moody
silence
it
was
now
day
the
sun
shot
up
suddenly
and
lighted
the
other
side
of
the
bay
where
the
land
spread
out
bleak
black
dreary
and
dismal
in
front
of
the
party
rose
a
range
of
hills
that
threw
a
dark
shadow
on
the
sand
and
in
this
shadow
the
women
walked
above
them
on
the
rising
ground
could
be
seen
many
cabins
and
blue
wreaths
of
smoke
rising
from
the
chimneys
into
the
air
a
cock
crowed
loudly
and
several
others
joined
in
chorus
a
dog
barked
at
the
heels
of
a
stubborn
cow
which
a
ragged
boy
was
driving
into
a
wet
pasture
field
the
snow
which
lay
light
on
the
knolls
was
rapidly
thawing
the
sea
now
dark
blue
in
colour
rose
in
a
long
heaving
swell
and
the
wind
blowing
in
from
the
horizon
was
bitterly
cold
when
will
the
tide
be
out
again
asked
judy
farrel
a
thin
undersized
consumptive
woman
who
coughed
loudly
as
she
walked
when
the
sun
s
on
dooey
head
came
the
answer
an
old
wrinkled
stump
of
a
woman
now
joined
the
party
she
carried
a
bundle
of
stockings
wrapped
in
a
shawl
hung
across
her
shoulders
as
she
walked
she
kept
telling
her
beads
we
were
just
talkin
of
ye
maire
a
glan
said
biddy
wor
how
many
stockin
s
have
ye
in
that
bundle
mother
of
god
pray
for
us
sinners
now
and
at
the
hour
of
our
death
amen
said
the
woman
speaking
in
gaelic
and
drawing
her
prayer
to
a
close
then
to
biddy
wor
a
dozen
long
stockings
that
i
have
been
working
on
for
a
whole
fortnight
the
thread
was
bad
bitter
bad
as
the
old
man
said
and
i
could
hardly
get
the
mastery
of
it
and
think
of
it
good
woman
just
think
of
it
farley
mckeown
only
gives
me
thirteen
pence
for
the
dozen
and
he
gives
other
knitters
one
and
three
he
gave
my
good
man
a
job
building
the
big
warehouse
in
greenanore
and
then
he
took
two
pence
off
me
in
the
dozen
of
you
don
t
say
so
true
as
death
said
maire
a
glan
and
farley
is
building
a
big
place
as
the
old
man
said
he
has
well
nigh
over
forty
men
on
the
and
what
would
he
be
paying
them
seven
shillings
a
week
without
bit
or
sup
it
is
a
hard
job
too
for
my
man
himself
leaves
here
at
six
of
the
clock
in
the
morning
and
he
is
not
back
at
our
own
fire
till
eight
of
the
clock
at
get
away
but
that
isn
t
all
nor
the
half
of
it
as
the
man
said
maire
a
glan
went
on
himself
has
to
do
all
the
work
at
home
before
dawn
and
after
dusk
so
that
he
has
only
four
hours
to
sleep
in
the
turn
of
the
just
think
of
that
said
maire
a
crick
that
s
not
all
nor
half
of
it
as
the
old
man
said
the
woman
with
the
bundle
continued
my
man
gets
one
bag
of
yellow
meal
from
farley
every
fortnight
for
we
have
eight
children
and
not
a
pratee
thanks
be
to
god
farley
charges
people
like
yourselves
only
sixteen
shillings
a
bag
but
he
charges
us
every
penny
of
a
gold
sovereign
on
the
bags
that
we
get
if
we
do
not
pay
at
the
end
of
a
month
he
puts
on
another
sixpence
and
at
the
end
of
six
months
he
has
three
extra
shillings
on
the
bag
of
yellow
god
be
praised
but
he
s
a
sharp
one
said
the
beansho
is
this
you
asked
the
woman
with
the
bundle
looking
at
the
speaker
have
you
some
stockings
in
your
shawl
too
sorrow
the
one
answered
the
beansho
but
what
have
ye
there
asked
maire
a
glan
then
as
if
recollecting
she
exclaimed
oh
i
know
it
is
the
wean
as
the
man
said
and
is
this
yourself
norah
ryan
it
s
myself
replied
the
child
and
her
teeth
chattered
as
she
answered
the
blush
is
going
from
your
cheek
said
maire
a
glan
and
your
mother
is
she
better
in
health
they
re
hard
times
that
are
in
it
now
she
went
on
without
waiting
for
an
answer
to
her
question
there
are
only
ten
creels
of
potatoes
in
our
townland
and
these
have
to
be
used
for
seed
god
s
mercy
be
on
us
as
the
old
man
said
but
it
was
a
bad
year
for
the
crops
it
couldn
t
have
been
worse
said
judy
farrel
clapping
her
thin
hands
to
keep
them
warm
on
our
side
of
the
water
old
oiney
dinchy
that
s
the
man
who
has
the
dog
that
bit
dermod
flynn
had
to
dig
in
the
pratee
field
for
six
hours
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
had
only
pratees
in
the
if
the
crows
lifted
a
potato
in
glenmornan
this
minute
all
the
people
of
the
glen
would
follow
the
crow
for
a
whole
week
until
they
got
the
potato
back
said
old
maire
a
crick
it
s
as
bad
now
as
it
was
in
the
year
of
the
do
you
mind
the
famine
year
asked
norah
ryan
the
water
was
streaming
from
the
girl
s
clothes
into
the
roadway
and
though
she
broke
into
a
run
at
times
in
her
endeavour
to
keep
pace
with
the
elder
women
the
shivering
fits
did
not
leave
her
for
an
instant
the
wind
became
more
violent
and
the
sleet
which
had
ceased
for
a
while
was
again
falling
from
the
clouds
in
white
wavy
lines
i
mind
the
bad
times
as
well
as
i
mind
yesterday
said
maire
a
crick
my
own
father
mother
and
sister
died
in
one
turn
of
the
sun
with
the
wasting
sickness
and
the
hunger
i
waked
them
all
alone
by
myself
for
most
of
the
neighbours
had
their
own
sick
and
their
own
dead
to
look
after
but
they
helped
me
to
carry
my
people
to
the
grave
in
the
coffin
that
had
the
door
with
hinges
on
the
bottom
when
we
came
to
the
grave
the
door
was
opened
and
the
dead
were
dropped
out
then
the
coffin
was
taken
back
for
some
other
at
that
time
there
lived
a
family
named
gorlachs
at
the
foot
of
slieve
a
dorras
said
maire
a
glan
taking
up
the
tale
and
they
lifted
their
child
out
of
the
grave
on
the
night
after
it
was
buried
and
ate
it
in
their
own
house
wasn
t
that
the
awful
thing
as
the
old
man
said
i
wouldn
t
put
it
past
them
for
they
were
a
bad
set
the
same
gorlachs
said
maire
a
crick
but
for
all
that
maybe
it
is
that
there
wasn
t
a
word
of
truth
in
the
whole
iv
norah
ryan
who
was
now
lagging
in
the
rear
got
suddenly
caught
by
a
heavy
gust
of
wind
that
blew
up
from
the
sea
her
clothes
were
lifted
over
her
head
she
tried
to
push
them
down
and
the
purse
which
she
held
in
her
hand
dropped
on
the
roadway
the
penny
jingled
out
the
coin
which
was
to
procure
her
bread
in
greenanore
and
she
clutched
at
it
hurriedly
a
sudden
dizziness
overcame
her
her
brain
reeled
and
she
fell
prostrate
to
the
wet
earth
in
an
instant
the
beansho
was
at
her
side
norah
ryan
what
s
coming
over
ye
she
cried
and
knelt
down
by
the
girl
the
child
s
face
was
deathly
pale
the
sleet
cut
her
viciously
and
her
hands
lying
palm
upwards
on
the
mire
were
blue
and
cold
the
beansho
tried
to
raise
her
but
the
effort
was
too
much
the
child
which
the
woman
carried
impeded
her
movements
maire
a
crick
now
hurried
up
and
the
rest
of
the
women
approached
though
in
a
more
leisurely
fashion
mother
of
god
what
s
wrong
what
s
wrong
asked
the
old
woman
anxiously
what
has
come
over
the
child
atall
atall
she
s
starving
the
old
body
went
on
kneeling
on
the
roadway
and
pressing
her
warty
hands
on
the
breast
of
the
young
girl
she
s
starving
that
s
it
in
her
own
home
she
hardly
eats
one
bite
at
all
so
that
her
people
may
have
the
more
so
i
have
heard
tell
norah
ryan
for
god
s
sake
wake
up
the
girl
gave
no
heed
made
no
sign
the
sleet
sang
through
the
air
and
the
women
gathered
closer
shielding
the
little
one
with
their
bodies
what
s
to
be
done
asked
the
beansho
biddy
wor
told
how
people
were
cured
of
fargortha
hunger
at
the
time
of
the
famine
but
little
heed
was
paid
to
her
talk
the
beansho
unloosened
her
shawl
wrapped
her
offspring
tightly
in
it
and
handed
the
bundle
to
one
of
the
women
who
crossed
herself
as
she
caught
it
now
up
on
my
back
with
the
girsha
said
the
beansho
authoritatively
stooping
on
her
knees
in
the
roadway
and
bending
her
shoulders
martin
eveleen
has
a
house
across
the
rise
of
the
brae
and
i
ll
carry
her
three
of
the
party
lifted
norah
and
placed
her
across
the
beansho
s
shoulders
how
weighty
the
girsha
is
one
exclaimed
then
recollecting
said
it
s
the
water
in
her
clothes
that
s
doing
it
poor
girsha
and
it
ll
be
the
hunger
that
s
causing
her
the
the
beansho
with
her
burden
on
her
shoulders
hurried
forward
her
feet
pressing
deeply
into
the
mire
and
the
water
squirting
out
between
her
toes
the
rest
of
the
party
following
discussed
the
matter
and
being
most
of
them
old
cronies
related
stories
of
the
hunger
that
was
in
it
at
the
time
of
the
great
famine
again
it
faired
the
sun
came
out
but
the
air
was
still
bitterly
cold
a
cabin
stood
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
towards
this
the
beansho
hurried
strong
and
lank
though
she
was
the
burden
began
to
bear
heavily
and
she
panted
at
every
step
at
the
door
of
the
house
she
paused
for
a
moment
to
collect
her
strength
then
lifted
the
latch
and
pushed
the
door
inwards
a
man
shaggy
and
barefooted
hurried
to
meet
the
woman
and
stared
at
her
suspiciously
what
do
you
want
he
asked
in
gaelic
it
s
norah
ryan
that
s
hungry
and
she
fainted
on
the
road
explained
the
beansho
in
with
her
then
said
the
man
standing
aside
maybe
the
heat
of
the
fire
will
take
her
to
indeed
there
s
little
else
that
she
can
get
inside
it
was
warm
and
a
bright
fire
blazed
on
the
cabin
hearth
in
a
corner
near
the
door
some
cows
could
be
heard
munching
hay
and
a
dog
came
sniffing
round
the
beansho
s
legs
a
feeling
of
homeliness
pervaded
the
place
and
the
smell
of
the
peat
was
soothing
to
the
nostrils
leave
her
down
here
said
the
woman
of
the
house
a
pale
sickly
little
creature
as
she
pointed
to
the
dingy
bed
in
the
corner
of
the
room
near
the
fire
several
children
dressed
in
rags
who
were
seated
warming
their
hands
at
the
blaze
rose
hurriedly
on
the
entrance
of
the
strangers
and
hid
behind
the
cattle
near
the
door
is
it
the
hunger
and
hardships
asked
the
man
of
the
house
as
he
helped
the
beansho
to
place
the
inert
body
of
the
little
girl
on
the
bed
the
hunger
and
hardships
that
s
it
said
maire
a
crick
who
now
entered
followed
by
the
rest
of
the
women
then
we
ll
try
her
with
this
said
the
man
and
from
behind
the
rafters
of
the
roof
he
drew
out
a
black
bottle
which
he
uncorked
with
his
fingers
it
s
potheen
he
explained
and
emptied
some
of
the
contents
into
a
wooden
bowl
this
he
held
to
the
lips
of
the
child
who
now
partly
from
the
effects
of
the
heat
and
partly
from
the
effects
of
the
shaking
she
had
received
on
the
beansho
s
back
awakened
and
was
staring
vacantly
around
her
the
smell
of
the
intoxicant
brought
her
sharply
to
her
senses
what
are
ye
doin
she
cried
that
s
not
right
and
me
havin
the
holy
pledge
against
drink
the
man
crossed
himself
and
withdrew
the
bowl
whereupon
the
woman
of
the
house
brought
some
milk
from
the
basin
that
stood
on
the
dresser
and
this
being
handed
to
norah
ryan
the
child
drank
greedily
the
beansho
gave
her
a
piece
of
bread
when
the
milk
was
consumed
where
is

asked
norah
suddenly

man
said
the
beansho

for
ye
re
dyin
of
for
a
moment
the
child
looked
earnestly
at
the
bread
then
as
if
stifling
the
impulse
to
return
it
she
began
to
eat
almost
savagely
maire
a
crick
placed
the
purse
and
penny
which
she
had
lifted
from
the
road
by
the
bedside
and
withdrew
to
the
door
already
sorry
perhaps
for
having
wasted
so
much
time
on
the
journey
the
beansho
found
her
baby
kissed
a
crumb
into
its
mouth
tied
it
up
again
in
her
shawl
and
when
norah
had
eaten
the
bread
both
went
to
the
door
together
god

the

said
the
man
taking
down
a
bottle
of
holy
water
from
the
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
dipped
his
fingers
in
the
bottle
and
shook
the
holy
water
over
the
visitors
god

he
said
and

over

and
everything
in

and
the
beansho
made
answer
in
one
voice
chapter
ii
an
unsuccessful
journey
i
the
hour
was
ten
in
the
forenoon
in
the
village
town
the
peasantry
called
it
of
greenanore
two
rows
of
houses
ran
parallel
along
a
miry
street
which
measured
east
to
west
some
two
hundred
yards
at
one
end
of
the
street
were
the
police
barracks
and
at
the
other
end
the
workhouse
behind
the
latter
rose
the
catholic
chapel
and
further
back
the
brown
moors
stretched
to
the
hills
which
looked
down
upon
the
bay
where
the
women
crossed
in
the
early
morning
the
houses
in
the
village
were
dull
dirty
and
dilapidated
there
were
eight
a
few
grocers
shops
a
smithy
where
the
blacksmith
who
mended
scythes
or
shod
donkeys
got
paid
in
kind
for
his
services
the
policemen
one
to
every
fifty
souls
in
the
village
paraded
idly
up
and
down
the
street
their
heavy
batons
clanking
against
their
trousers
and
their
boots
spotlessly
clean
rasping
eternally
on
the
pavement
their
sole
occupation
seemed
to
be
the
kicking
of
unoffending
dogs
that
spent
their
days
and
nights
in
a
vain
search
for
some
eatable
garbage
in
the
gutter
the
dogs
were
skeletons
and
when
kicked
they
would
slink
quietly
out
of
the
way
lacking
courage
either
to
snap
or
snarl
even
a
kick
brought
no
yelp
from
them
they
were
almost
insensible
to
every
feeling
but
that
of
the
heavy
hunger
which
dulled
their
natural
activity
at
night
they
were
silent
ghosts
prowling
about
looking
for
a
morsel
to
eat
now
and
again
they
howled
mournfully
sitting
on
their
haunches
in
a
circle
and
when
the
people
heard
the
lonely
sound
they
would
say
there
the
dogs
are
crying
because
they
have
got
no
a
little
man
stepped
briskly
along
the
street
of
the
village
one
gloved
hand
grasping
a
stout
stick
the
other
also
gloved
sunk
in
the
capacious
pocket
of
a
heavy
overcoat
he
walked
as
if
he
lacked
throwing
the
legs
out
from
his
hips
but
save
for
this
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
the
man
except
perhaps
his
stoutness
the
people
of
greenanore
battling
daily
against
the
terrible
spectre
of
hunger
had
no
time
to
grow
fat
yet
this
man
measured
forty
inches
round
the
waist
in
the
midst
of
extreme
poverty
he
strange
to
say
had
grown
corpulent
and
rich
his
name
was
farley
mckeown
now
possessor
of
part
of
it
invested
in
south
american
railways
and
part
of
it
in
the
donegal
knitting
industry
and
nearly
all
of
it
earned
in
the
latter
farley
mckeown
was
now
seventy
years
of
age
and
unmarried
at
one
time
years
before
he
had
his
desires
as
most
young
men
have
and
the
sight
of
a
comely
girl
going
barefooted
to
greenanore
imparted
a
fiery
and
not
unpleasant
vigour
to
his
body
and
caused
strange
but
not
unnatural
thoughts
to
enter
into
his
mind
he
was
then
a
young
man
of
twenty
thoughtful
and
ambitious
although
his
father
was
poor
the
boy
educated
by
some
hedge
schoolmaster
showed
promise
and
evinced
a
desire
to
become
a
priest
it
is
an
easy
job
he
said
to
himself
and
a
priest
can
make
plenty
of
farley
mckeown
desired
to
make
money
anyway
and
anyhow
when
the
black
potato
blight
with
the
fever
and
famine
that
followed
it
spread
over
donegal
farley
mckeown
saw
his
chance
by
dint
of
plausible
arguments
he
persuaded
a
firm
of
londonderry
grain
merchants
to
ship
a
cargo
of
indian
meal
to
greenanore
and
promised
to
pay
for
the
consignment
within
two
years
from
the
date
of
its
arrival
when
the
cargo
was
landed
on
dooey
head
the
people
hailed
it
as
a
gift
from
god
and
the
priest
blessed
farley
mckeown
from
the
altar
steps
the
peasants
built
a
large
warehouse
for
mckeown
and
in
return
for
the
work
they
were
allowed
a
whole
year
in
which
to
pay
for
their
meal
meanwhile
the
younger
generation
went
off
to
america
and
money
flowed
in
to
donegal
and
farley
mckeown
s
pocket
at
the
end
of
two
years
he
had
paid
the
grain
merchants
but
the
peasants
found
to
their
astonishment
that
had
only
paid
interest
on
the
cost
of
their
food
they
were
in
the
man
s
clutches
always
paying
for
goods
received
and
in
some
strange
way
never
clear
of
debt
this
went
on
for
years
and
farley
mckeown
a
pillar
of
the
church
and
the
friend
of
the
holy
priest
waxed
wealthy
on
the
proceeds
of
his
business
then
he
started
a
knitting
industry
and
again
was
hailed
by
the
priest
as
the
saviour
of
the
people
from
far
and
near
from
the
most
southerly
to
the
most
northerly
point
of
donegal
the
peasant
women
came
to
greenanore
for
yarn
crossing
arms
of
the
sea
mountains
and
moors
on
their
journey
and
carrying
back
bundles
of
yarn
to
their
homes
the
journey
was
in
many
cases
thirty
miles
each
way
and
these
miles
were
tramped
by
women
between
a
sleep
and
a
sleep
often
with
only
one
meal
in
their
stomachs
the
daughters
of
donegal
are
splendid
knitters
but
how
difficult
to
make
are
those
wonderful
stockings
when
there
is
nothing
but
the
peat
fire
or
the
rushlight
to
show
the
women
the
dreary
and
countless
stitches
that
go
to
make
the
whole
marvellous
work
how
quick
those
irons
flash
in
the
firelight
how
they
tinkle
tinkle
one
against
another
as
the
nimble
fingers
wind
the
threads
around
them
but
alas
how
wearying
the
toil
and
the
time
usually
taken
to
make
a
pair
of
socks
was
sixteen
hours
and
the
wages
paid
for
sixteen
hours
work
was
a
penny
farthing
ii
farley
mckeown
strutted
along
the
street
inflating
his
stomach
with
dignity
as
he
walked
and
casting
careless
looks
around
him
all
those
whom
he
met
saluted
him
the
men
raised
their
hands
to
their
caps
the
women
bowed
gravely
and
the
children
when
they
saw
him
coming
ran
away
an
old
sow
black
and
dirty
from
her
wallow
in
some
near
midden
rushed
violently
into
the
street
and
grunted
as
she
mouthed
at
the
grime
in
the
gutter
a
peasant
boy
dressed
in
trousers
and
shirt
got
hold
of
one
of
the
young
pigs
and
the
animal
squealed
loudly
this
startled
the
mother
and
she
peered
round
her
little
stupid
eyes
blinking
angrily
on
seeing
that
one
of
her
young
was
possibly
in
danger
she
charged
full
at
the
youth
who
hurriedly
dropping
the
sucker
sought
the
safety
of
a
near
doorway
a
few
hens
rushed
off
with
long
remarkable
strides
that
made
one
wonder
how
the
ungainly
birds
saved
themselves
from
toppling
over
a
rooster
a
defiant
sultan
who
did
not
share
in
the
trepidacious
exit
of
his
wives
crowed
loudly
and
looked
valiantly
at
the
sow
as
much
as
to
say
i
for
one
am
not
the
least
afraid
of
the
boy
finding
himself
safe
ventured
out
again
into
the
street
but
coming
face
to
face
with
farley
mckeown
hurried
off
even
more
rapidly
than
when
pursued
by
the
sow
the
man
noticed
the
doubtful
mark
of
respect
which
the
youth
showed
him
purred
approvingly
and
smiled
the
smile
giving
him
the
appearance
of
an
serious
frog
mckeown
walked
along
the
street
towards
a
spacious
building
containing
many
large
windows
and
heavy
painted
doors
this
was
the
warehouse
in
which
he
stored
his
yarn
one
door
was
open
and
in
front
of
this
a
crowd
of
barefooted
women
and
children
were
standing
most
of
them
holding
large
bundles
of
stockings
which
they
frequently
changed
from
one
hand
to
another
they
did
not
dare
to
rest
their
bundles
on
the
street
which
was
wet
with
the
slabbery
sleet
of
farley
mckeown
came
to
the
door
and
from
there
surveyed
the
women
with
a
fixed
stare
they
shuffled
uneasily
a
few
crossed
themselves
and
one
a
young
girl
ventured
to
say
it
s
a
cold
morning
this
farley
mckeown
thanks
be
to
god
the
merchant
made
no
answer
to
see
those
creatures
shrinking
before
his
gaze
filled
him
with
a
comfortable
sense
of
importance
they
were
afraid
of
him
just
as
he
was
afraid
of
god
and
he
thought
that
he
must
be
like
god
in
their
eyes
he
fixed
another
withering
glance
on
the
crowd
then
turned
and
hurried
upstairs
to
the
top
floor
there
to
enter
a
room
where
two
young
men
were
seated
over
a
desk
struggling
with
long
rows
of
figures
in
dirty
ledgers
a
peat
fire
blazed
brightly
in
one
corner
of
the
room
and
the
cheerful
flame
was
a
red
rag
to
the
eyes
of
the
proprietor
he
looked
sternly
at
the
fire
then
at
the
clerks
then
at
the
fire
then
back
to
the
clerks
again
warm
here
isn
t
it
he
exclaimed
yes
it
s
warm
very
warm
very
comfortable
indeed
isn
t
it
it
s
nice
to
have
a
fire
on
a
cold
morning
very
nice
indeed
if
you
were
working
in
your
fathers
fields
you
d
have
a
fire
out
by
your
sides
you
d
carry
a
fire
about
in
your
pockets
all
day
you
would
indeed
is
it
not
enough
for
you
to
have
a
roof
over
you
he
cried
in
an
angry
tone
his
voice
rising
shrilly
a
roof
over
your
head
and
four
good
walls
to
keep
the
winds
of
heaven
away
from
your
bodies
no
it
isn
t
it
isn
t
it
isn
t
atall
atall
i
gave
you
orders
not
to
put
a
fire
on
till
i
came
into
the
office
myself
and
what
do
i
see
here
now
one
would
think
that
it
s
not
me
that
owns
this
business
who
does
own
it
i
d
like
to
know
is
it
me
or
is
it
you
gasping
for
breath
he
flopped
down
suddenly
into
a
chair
and
drawing
off
his
gloves
he
stuffed
them
into
the
pocket
of
his
coat
then
taking
an
account
book
he
stroked
out
several
figures
with
his
pen
while
between
every
pen
stroke
he
turned
round
and
shouted
is
it
me
that
owns
this
business
or
is
it
you
eh
after
a
while
he
ceased
to
speak
probably
forgetting
his
rage
in
the
midst
of
the
work
and
for
two
hours
there
was
almost
total
silence
save
for
the
low
scratchings
of
pen
on
paper
and
the
occasional
grunt
which
emanated
from
the
throat
of
farley
mckeown
suddenly
however
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
his
work
and
looked
at
the
skylight
above
through
which
snow
was
falling
and
some
of
it
skiting
off
the
dropped
on
the
top
of
his
head
which
being
bald
was
extremely
sensitive
to
climatic
changes
then
he
gave
an
order
slowly
and
emphatically
dony
mcnelis
close
the
one
of
the
clerks
a
tall
lank
youth
rose
like
a
rubber
ball
bounded
on
top
of
his
seat
and
closed
the
window
with
a
bang
on
stepping
down
to
resume
his
work
he
noticed
the
crowd
of
women
now
greatly
increased
by
the
party
which
had
crossed
the
bay
in
the
morning
standing
huddled
together
in
the
street
the
sleet
was
falling
thickly
it
was
now
more
snow
than
sleet
and
the
clothes
of
the
women
were
covered
with
a
fleecy
whiteness
the
clerk
paused
in
his
descent
and
looked
at
the
women
then
he
spoke
to
the
would
it
not
be
better
to
attend
to
these
women
now
he
asked
some
of
them
have
been
out
on
the
cold
street
since
the
farley
mckeown
turned
round
sharply
is
this
my
business
or

he
cried
rising
from
the
chair
and
stamping
his
feet
on
the
floor

or

money
is
it
that
your
mother
owes
me
couldn
t
i
turn
her
out
of
house
and
home
at
a
moment
s
notice
and
in
face
of
that
you
come
here
and
tell
me
how
to
run
my
own
business
isn
t
that
what
you
re
trying
to
do
eh
the
boy
sat
down
without
a
word
and
catching
a
piece
of
waste
paper
off
the
table
he
crumpled
it
angrily
in
his
hand
then
rising
again
he
confronted
his
master
there
are
women
out
there
from
tweedore
and
frosses
he
said
they
have
travelled
upwards
of
thirty
miles
hungry
all
of
them
i
ll
go
bail
and
maybe
not
a
penny
in
their
pockets
if
they
don
t
catch
the
tide
when
it
s
out
they
ll
have
to
sleep
on
the
rocks
of
dooey
all
night
and
if
they
do
there
ll
be
more
curses
on
your
head
in
the
morning
than
all
the
masses
ever
said
and
all
the
prayers
ever
prayed
will
be
fit
to
wash
away
it
s
nearly
one
of
the
clock
now
and
they
ll
have
to
race
and
catch
the
tide
afore
it
s
on
the
turn
so
it
would
be
the
best
thing
to
do
to
attend
to
them
this
the
youth
stood
for
a
moment
after
he
had
delivered
this
speech
the
longest
ever
made
by
him
in
his
life
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
saying
something
more
vehement
all
at
once
however
he
sat
down
again
and
went
on
with
his
work
as
if
nothing
unusual
had
happened
farley
mckeown
was
a
superstitious
man
he
feared
the
curse
of
an
angry
woman
as
much
as
he
feared
the
curse
of
a
priest
of
the
catholic
church
and
those
women
would
curse
him
if
they
slept
all
night
on
dooey
head
for
a
moment
he
glared
angrily
at
dony
mcnelis
then
went
to
the
window
facing
the
street
opened
it
and
looked
out
on
the
shivering
creatures
assembled
in
the
falling
snow
are
there
many
tweedore
and
frosses
people
here
he
shouted
there
s
a
good
lot
of
us
here
and
we
re
afraid
that
we
ll
be
a
wee
bit
late
for
the
tide
if
we
don
t
get
away
this
very
minute
said
a
voice
from
the
crowd
maire
a
crick
the
fatalist
was
speaking
have
ye
any
stockings
with
ye
sorrow
the
one
has
one
that
s
not
on
her
feet
save
maire
a
glan
and
she
doesn
t
come
from
our
side
of
the
water
maire
a
crick
answered
when
we
were
here
the
last
day
we
couldn
t
get
a
taste
of
yarn
and
we
had
to
sleep
all
night
on
the
rocks
of
dooey
all
night
mind
farley
mckeown
and
the
sky
glowering
like
a
hangman
and
the
sea
rushing
like
horses
of
war
up
on
the
strand
god
be
with
us
but
it
will
be
a
cold
place
on
a
night
like
this
for
the
love
of
mary
give
us
some
yarn
farley
mckeown
said
the
old
woman
in
a
piteous
voice
hours
have
passed
since
i
saw
bread
or
that
what
buys
mckeown
turned
round
to
his
clerks
is
there
much
yarn
down
below
he
asked
plenty
said
dony
mcnelis
wiping
his
pen
on
his
if
they
had
my
yarn
with
them
and
miss
the
tide
they
d
ruin
the
stuff
thought
farley
mckeown
then
turning
to
the
women
he
shouted
in
a
loud
voice
there
s
no
yarn
for
the
tweedore
and
frosses
women
this
day
maybe
if
they
come
or
the
day
after
they
ll
get
having
said
these
words
he
shut
the
window
chapter
iii
on
dooey
head
i
outside
the
women
who
had
taken
up
their
stand
at
dawn
were
still
changing
their
bundles
of
stockings
from
one
hand
to
another
and
sheltering
them
under
their
shawls
whenever
they
changed
them
all
the
time
they
kept
hitting
their
feet
sharply
against
the
gritty
street
trying
to
drive
the
cold
and
the
numbness
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
pavement
a
policeman
stood
for
a
moment
and
eyed
them
disdainfully
then
marched
on
his
baton
striking
soberly
against
his
leg
one
of
the
party
a
handsome
girl
stepped
out
from
the
crowd
and
lifting
her
dress
well
over
her
ankles
wrung
the
water
from
her
petticoats
a
young
fellow
passing
on
a
looked
shyly
at
the
girl
and
shouted
lift
them
a
bit
higher
girsha
just
a
little
bit
whereupon
the
maiden
blushed
dropped
her
dress
as
if
it
was
and
returned
hurriedly
to
her
companions
the
tweedore
and
frosses
women
had
gone
away
speaking
loudly
and
lamenting
over
their
many
of
them
were
eating
white
bread
a
new
importation
into
greenanore
but
without
butter
to
give
it
relish
or
liquid
to
wash
it
down
the
bread
cost
a
penny
a
chunk
and
one
penny
represented
a
whole
day
s
wages
to
most
of
the
women
norah
ryan
walked
with
them
but
in
her
lagging
gait
could
be
detected
great
weariness
and
in
her
eyes
there
were
traces
of
tears
the
poor
child
of
twelve
who
felt
her
suffering
very
keenly
offered
to
share
her
dry
crust
with
maire
a
crick
who
had
no
money
and
the
old
woman
looked
greedily
at
the
bread
for
a
moment
but
refused
to
accept
it
the
party
hurried
clear
of
the
town
their
bare
feet
pattering
loudly
on
the
road
suddenly
they
encountered
the
parish
priest
father
devaney
an
old
fellow
with
shiny
false
teeth
and
a
like
mckeown
he
pulled
his
rosary
from
his
pocket
and
began
to
pray
when
he
observed
his
parishioners
tweedore
and
frosses
people
he
cried
genially
turning
his
eyes
from
the
rosary
cross
to
the
women
have
ye
got
no
yarn
this
good
day
no
that
s
a
pity
but
believe
me
when
i
say
that
mckeown
is
doing
his
very
best
for
the
whole
lot
of
ye
he
s
a
good
man
a
sturdy
man
a
reliable
man
and
there
s
not
his
equal
barrin
the
priests
themselves
in
all
ireland
are
you
the
daughter
of
james
ryan
of
meenalicknalore
he
asked
turning
to
norah
ryan
that
i
am
father
answered
the
child
does
he
forget
about
the
money
that
i
m
wanting
for
the
building
of
my
new
house
asked
the
old
man
in
a
severe
tone
of
voice
i
want
five
pounds
from
every
family
in
the
parish
and
i
m
not
givin
them
one
year
or
two
years
but
a
whole
five
years
in
which
to
pay
it
they
re
most
of
them
payin
up
now
like
real
good
christians
and
catholics
for
they
want
to
see
their
own
soggarth
s
house
a
good
house
a
strong
house
and
a
substantial
house
but
there
is
some
of
my
own
flock
and
james
ryan
is
one
of
them
that
won
t
give
a
penny
piece
to
the
soggarth
who
is
goin
to
save
their
souls
for
them
listen
girsha
tell
james
ryan
when
you
get
home
that
the
first
pound
should
be
paid
at
michaelmas
and
it
s
now
long
past
hallowe
en
tell
him
that
i
pray
every
night
for
them
that
s
not
behind
in
comin
forward
to
help
the
priest
at
the
buildin
of
his
house
the
soggarth
s
house
and
the
house
of
all
his
people
tell
james
ryan
that
there
s
no
prayer
for
him
as
yet
but
if
he
hurries
up
with
just
one
pound
the
priest
suddenly
spied
the
beansho
staring
at
him
and
he
noticed
that
there
was
a
look
of
unfeigned
contempt
in
her
eyes
he
observed
the
bundle
in
her
shawl
and
suddenly
recollected
that
it
was
the
woman
s
child
the
talk
of
the
parish
barely
six
months
before
the
priest
looked
at
the
woman
fixedly
for
a
moment
then
knowing
that
all
the
party
was
watching
him
intently
he
raised
his
hand
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
forehead
this
was
as
much
as
to
say
god
save
me
from
this
woman
for
there
is
nothing
good
in
old
maire
a
crick
crossed
herself
in
imitation
of
the
soggarth
and
cast
a
look
of
withering
contempt
at
the
beansho
norah
ryan
also
raised
her
hand
but
suddenly
it
was
borne
to
her
that
the
action
of
maire
a
crick
was
very
unseemly
and
she
refrained
from
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
of
course
the
priest
was
right
in
what
he
had
done
she
knew
the
people
were
forbidden
to
see
anything
wrong
in
the
ways
of
the
soggarth
suddenly
the
old
man
turned
away
he
walked
off
a
short
distance
his
head
sunk
on
his
breast
and
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
the
rosary
dangling
from
his
fingers
perhaps
he
was
deep
in
thought
or
maybe
he
was
saying
a
prayer
for
the
beansho
the
poor
woman
buried
beneath
her
weight
of
sin
and
sorrow
had
no
doubt
filled
him
with
compassion
what
would
he
the
father
of
the
flock
not
do
to
make
lighter
the
woman
s
burden
all
at
once
he
paused
turned
round
and
faced
the
women
who
were
staring
after
him
norah
ryan
he
called
and
his
voice
was
pregnant
with
priestly
gravity
if
yer
father
doesn
t
send
me
the
pound
before
the
end
of
the
next
month
he
ll
have
no
luck
in
this
world
and
no
happiness
in
the
next
tell
him
that
i
meself
the
parish
priest
said
these
very
having
thus
spoken
the
good
man
went
on
his
way
telling
his
beads
perhaps
counting
by
their
aid
the
number
of
sovereigns
required
for
the
construction
of
his
mansion
that
will
make
some
people
sit
up
if
they
don
t
sink
into
their
brogues
said
maire
a
crick
glancing
in
turn
at
norah
ryan
and
the
beansho
mother
of
jesus
to
have
the
priest
talking
to
one
like
that
who
ever
heard
the
likes
of
it
do
you
know
how
much
the
priest
is
goin
to
spend
on
a
for
his
new
house
asked
the
beansho
drily
said
judy
farrel
what
s
that
old
oiney
dinchy
of
glenmornan
said
that
it
is
a
place
for
keeping
holy

maire
a
crick
holy

my
eye

the
beansho
it
s
the
place
where
the
priest
washes
i
ve
heard
of
them
washin
themselves
away
in
foreign
parts
all
over
and
every
day
said
a
woman
but
they
must
be
far
from

in
them
places
they
just
go
into
big
things
full
of
water
just
as

a
midden
father

wish

used
to
wash
his
hands
in
an
old
tub
and
that
s
all
the
washin
ever
he
did
and
wouldn
t
ye
think
that
a
tub
was
good
enough
for
this
man
but

talking
about
exclaimed
the
woman
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
isn
t
it
the
priest
that
knows
what
is
best
to
do
he
s
goin
to
spend
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
on
his

said
the
beansho
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
on
one
single
room
of
his
house

not
fill
yer
own
bellies
and

exclaimed
biddy
wor
staring
aghast
at
the
beansho
ye
re
turnin
out
to
be
a
prodisan
sheila
carrol
talkin
of
the
priest
in
that
way
no
wonder
indeed
that
he
puts
the
cross
on
his
forehead
when
he
meets
no
wonder
indeed
chimed
a
chorus
of
voices
the
sun
god
forgive
me
for
callin
it
a
sun
will
be
near
dooey
head
this
minute
maire
a
crick
reminded
the
party
who
had
forgotten
about
the
tide
in
the
heat
of
the
discussion
now
they
hurried
off
breaking
into
a
run
from
time
to
time
judy
farrel
leading
her
little
pinched
figure
doubling
up
almost
into
a
knot
when
she
coughed
last
in
the
race
were
norah
ryan
and
maire
a
crick
ii
the
darkness
was
falling
as
the
women
raced
down
the
crooked
road
that
ran
to
dooey
foreshore
a
few
birch
bushes
with
trembling
branches
tossing
hither
and
thither
like
tangled
tresses
bounded
the
road
at
intervals
the
sky
was
overcast
with
slatey
clouds
and
in
the
intervening
distance
between
foreshore
and
horizon
no
separate
object
could
be
distinguished
everything
there
had
blended
together
in
grey
formless
mistiness
there
was
hardly
a
word
spoken
the
pattering
of
bare
feet
judy
farrel
s
cough
and
the
hard
laboured
breathing
of
the
elder
women
were
all
that
could
be
heard
one
of
the
party
well
in
advance
barefooted
and
carrying
her
shoes
hung
round
her
neck
with
a
piece
of
string
struck
her
toe
sharply
against
a
rock
the
curse
of
the
devil
she
exclaimed
then
in
a
quieter
voice
it
s
god
s
blessin
that
i
haven
t
my
brogues
on
my
feet
for
they
would
be
ruined
a
belated
bird
cried
sharply
and
its
call
was
carried
in
from
the
sea
somewhere
in
the
distance
a
cow
lowed
the
sound
was
prolonged
in
a
hundred
ravines
the
bar
moaned
fretfully
as
if
in
a
troubled
sleep
the
snow
ceased
to
fall
and
some
stars
glittered
bright
as
diamonds
in
the
cold
heavens
mother
of
god
it
s
on
the
turn
maire
a
crick
shouted
and
hurried
as
rapidly
as
her
legs
would
permit
down
the
hill
at
intervals
some
of
the
party
following
her
would
stumble
fall
turn
head
over
heels
and
rise
rapidly
again
they
came
to
the
strand
raced
across
it
making
little
noise
with
their
feet
as
they
ran
and
with
their
bodies
as
they
fell
norah
ryan
s
head
shook
fitfully
from
side
to
side
as
she
tried
to
keep
pace
with
her
companions
they
were
not
aware
of
the
proximity
of
the
dhan
until
they
were
in
the
water
and
splashing
it
all
around
them
when
across
maire
a
crick
found
the
water
at
her
breast
another
step
and
it
reached
her
chin
those
behind
could
only
see
a
black
head
bobbing
in
the
waves
come
back
maire
a
crick
biddy
wor
shouted
ye
ll
be
drownded
if
ye
go
one
step
at
all
the
old
woman
turned
came
back
slowly
and
solemnly
without
speaking
a
word
on
reaching
the
strand
she
went
down
on
her
knees
and
raised
her
eyes
to
heaven
looking
up
through
the
snowy
flakes
that
were
now
falling
out
of
the
darkness
then
she
spoke
and
her
voice
rising
shrill
and
terrible
carried
far
across
the
dhan
may
seven
curses
from
the
lips
of
jesus
christ
fall
seven
times
seven
on
the
head
of
farley
mckeown
the
waves
rolled
up
to
her
feet
stretching
out
like
black
sinuous
snakes
a
long
wailing
wind
that
put
droumy
thoughts
into
the
hearts
of
those
who
listened
to
it
swept
in
from
the
sea
behind
on
the
shore
large
rocks
frightful
and
shapeless
stood
out
amidst
stunted
bushes
that
sobbed
in
dismal
unison
the
women
went
back
to
the
rocks
passing
through
that
shook
in
the
breeze
like
eels
all
around
the
brambles
writhed
like
long
arms
clutching
at
their
prey
with
horrible
claws
a
tuft
of
withered
fern
flew
by
in
the
air
as
if
escaping
from
something
which
followed
it
and
again
the
cry
of
the
solitary
pierced
the
darkness
between
the
clefts
of
a
large
rock
which
in
some
past
age
had
been
split
by
lightning
the
women
worn
out
with
their
day
s
journey
sat
down
in
a
circle
their
shawls
drawn
over
their
heads
and
their
feet
tucked
well
up
under
their
petticoats
the
darkness
almost
overpowered
norah
ryan
she
shuddered
and
the
shudder
chilled
her
to
the
heart
it
was
not
terror
that
possessed
her
but
something
more
unendurable
than
terror
it
was
the
agony
of
a
soul
dwarfed
by
the
immensity
of
the
infinite
she
was
lonely
desperately
lonely
in
the
midst
of
the
women
she
was
far
from
them
they
began
to
speak
and
their
voices
were
the
voices
of
dreams
maire
a
crick
speaking
in
gaelic
was
telling
a
story
while
wringing
the
water
from
her
clothes
the
story
of
a
barrow
that
came
across
the
hills
of
glenmornan
in
the
year
of
the
famine
and
on
the
barrow
which
rolled
along
of
its
own
accord
there
was
a
large
coffin
with
a
door
at
the
bottom
of
it
then
another
of
the
party
told
of
her
grandfather
s
wake
and
the
naked
man
who
came
to
the
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
took
up
a
seat
by
the
chimney
corner
he
never
spoke
a
word
but
smoked
the
pipe
of
tobacco
that
was
handed
to
him
when
the
cock
crew
with
the
dawn
he
got
up
from
his
seat
and
went
out
and
away
nobody
knew
the
man
and
no
one
ever
saw
him
again
we
might
get
shelter
in
one
of
the
houses
up
there
said
norah
ryan
rousing
herself
and
pointing
to
the
hill
above
where
the
rushlights
flickered
and
shone
at
intervals
in
the
scattered
cabins
we
might
said
maire
a
crick
we
might
indeed
but
it
s
not
in
me
to
go
askin
a
night
s
shelter
under
the
roof
of
a
ballybonar
man
there
was
once
years
ago
a
black
word
between
the
ballybonar
people
and
the
people
of
our
side
of
the
water
since
then
we
haven
t
darkened
one
another
s
doorsteps
and
we
re
not
going
to
do
it
maybe
someone
on
our
side
will
send
a
boat
across
said
the
beansho
maybe
they
ll
do
that
if
they
re
not
at
the
fishin
judy
farrel
answered
and
when
are
they
not
at
the
fishin
they
re
always
out
on
the
diddy
of
the
sea
and
never
catching
a
fish
atall
atall
we
ll
walk
about
it
will
keep
our
feet
and
maybe
fall
down
between
the
rocks
and
break
our
bits
of
the
rushlights
on
the
hill
above
went
out
one
by
one
and
the
darkness
became
intense
the
ballybonar
people
had
gone
to
bed
one
of
the
women
on
the
rock
began
to
snore
loudly
and
those
who
remained
awake
envied
her
because
she
slept
so
soundly
i
suppose
farley
mckeown
will
have
a
feather
bed
under
him
now
said
maire
a
crick
with
a
broken
laugh
it
seemed
as
if
she
was
weeping
the
beansho
who
was
giving
suck
to
her
babe
turned
to
norah
ryan
who
sat
beside
her
what
are
you
thinking
of
norah
she
asked
in
gaelic
i
m
just
wondering
if
my
mother
is
better
answered
the
child
i
hope
she
is
said
the
beansho
are
you
sleepy
would
you
like
to
sleep
like
the
earth
like
the
ground
under
you
in
the
grave
you
mean
no
no
child
but
like
the
world
at
night
like
the
ground
under
you
it
s
asleep
now
one
can
almost
hear
it
breathing
and
one
would
like
to
sleep
with
it
if
ever
you
think
that
the
earth
is
asleep
norah
be
careful
maybe
when
you
grow
up
some
man
will
say
to
you
i
like
you
better
than
anyone
else
in
the
that
will
be
very
nice
to
listen
to
norah
maybe
you
ll
walk
with
the
man
on
a
lonely
moor
or
on
the
strand
beside
the
sea
it
will
be
night
and
there
will
be
many
stars
in
the
sky
and
you
ll
not
say
they
re
cold
then
as
you
said
this
morning
norah
all
at
once
you
ll
stop
and
listen
you
ll
not
know
why
you
listen
for
everything
will
be
so
quiet
but
for
a
minute
it
will
come
to
you
that
the
earth
is
asleep
and
that
everything
is
in
slumber
that
will
be
a
dangerous
hour
child
for
then
you
may
commit
the
mortal
sin
of
was
that
your
sin
sheila
carrol
asked
norah
ryan
calling
the
woman
by
her
correct
name
for
the
first
time
that
was
my
sin
but
you
said
this
morning
never
mind
what
i
said
this
morning
answered
the
woman
in
a
tone
of
mild
reproof
i
m
only
saying
that
the
ground
under
us
and
around
us
is
now
the
ground
sleeping
exclaimed
maire
a
crick
who
overheard
the
last
words
of
the
conversation
i
never
heard
such
silly
talk
coming
out
of
a
mouth
in
all
my
life
neither
have
i
said
norah
ryan
but
she
spoke
so
low
that
no
one
not
even
the
beansho
heard
her
maire
a
crick
sang
a
song
it
told
of
a
youth
who
lived
in
ireland
when
cows
were
kine
and
pigs
were
swine
and
eagles
of
the
air
built
their
nests
in
the
beards
of
when
the
youth
was
born
his
father
planted
a
tree
in
honour
of
the
event
the
boy
grew
up
very
proud
of
this
tree
and
daily
he
watered
and
tended
it
and
one
day
the
boy
was
hung
why
the
song
never
stated
from
the
branches
of
his
own
tree
there
never
was
a
man
hung
either
in
frosses
or
tweedore
said
the
woman
who
had
just
been
snoring
never
a
mother
s
son
so
i
have
heard
maire
a
crick
remarked
pulling
her
feet
well
up
under
her
petticoats
in
frosses
and
tweedore
there
never
was
a
tree
strong
enough
to
bear
the
weight
of
a
man
and
never
a
man
with
a
body
weighty
enough
to
break
his
own
having
said
this
the
old
woman
who
came
from
the
south
of
donegal
chuckled
deep
down
in
her
throat
and
showed
the
one
remaining
tooth
which
she
possessed
in
a
hideous
grin
iii
about
the
hour
of
midnight
the
heavens
cleared
and
the
moon
hardly
full
lighted
up
the
coast
of
western
donegal
on
the
bosom
of
the
sea
a
few
dark
specks
moved
to
and
fro
and
at
intervals
the
splash
of
oars
could
be
heard
when
the
oars
were
lifted
out
of
the
sea
the
water
falling
from
them
looked
like
molten
silver
norah
will
be
warm
in
bed
by
now
said
a
voice
if
she
caught
the
tide
when
it
was
standing
a
voice
clearer
and
younger
replied
if
she
caught
the
tide
repeated
the
first
speaker
in
a
thoughtful
tone
then
after
a
short
silence
does
not
the
land
look
black
back
from
the
sea
the
youth
studied
the
attentively
allowing
his
oar
to
trail
through
the
water
mother
of
god
but
it
looks
ugly
he
replied
i
hate
it
i
hate
it
more
than
i
hate
anything
on
shore
most
of
the
women
were
now
asleep
amongst
the
rocks
their
shawls
drawn
tightly
over
their
heads
and
their
feet
tucked
up
under
their
petticoats
maire
a
crick
still
awake
hummed
a
tune
deep
down
in
her
throat
and
judy
farrel
coughed
incessantly
one
white
youthful
face
was
turned
to
the
heavens
and
the
moon
glancing
for
a
moment
on
the
pale
cheeks
of
the
sleeper
caused
a
tear
falling
from
the
closed
eyelids
to
sparkle
like
a
pearl
chapter
iv
restless
youth
i
james
ryan
s
cabin
lay
within
half
a
mile
of
the
sea
and
his
croft
a
long
strip
of
sapless
land
ran
down
to
the
very
shore
but
this
strip
of
land
was
so
narrow
that
the
house
small
though
it
was
could
not
be
built
across
and
instead
of
the
an
end
gable
faced
the
water
in
frosses
most
of
the
land
is
divided
into
thin
strips
for
it
is
the
unwritten
law
that
they
who
have
no
land
touching
the
sea
may
not
lift
any
to
manure
their
potato
patches
in
frosses
some
of
the
crofts
measuring
two
miles
in
length
are
seldom
more
than
eight
paces
in
width
at
any
point
all
over
the
district
gigantic
boulders
are
strewn
huge
rocks
that
might
have
been
flung
about
in
play
by
monstrous
giants
who
forgot
when
their
humour
was
at
an
end
to
gather
them
up
again
between
these
rocks
the
people
till
for
crops
plots
of
land
which
seldom
measure
more
than
four
yards
square
and
every
rock
conceals
either
a
potato
patch
or
cornfield
it
was
said
years
ago
that
frosses
had
blades
of
grass
to
the
square
foot
but
this
was
contradicted
by
a
sarcastic
peasant
who
said
that
if
grass
grew
so
plentifully
with
them
they
would
all
be
wealthy
fishing
was
indulged
in
but
very
little
fish
was
ever
landed
scottish
and
english
trawlers
netted
the
fish
and
few
were
picked
up
by
the
peasantry
whose
boats
and
nets
were
of
the
most
primitive
pattern
the
nets
were
bad
the
boats
mere
curraghs
were
untrustworthy
and
a
great
deal
of
the
fishermen
s
time
was
usually
spent
in
baling
out
water
at
best
fishing
was
for
them
an
almost
profitless
trade
they
had
no
markets
and
no
carts
to
send
their
fish
to
town
for
the
most
part
the
fishers
used
the
fish
themselves
or
traded
them
in
kind
with
their
neighbours
on
the
morning
following
the
women
s
visit
to
greenanore
two
men
came
up
from
the
sea
towards
the
door
of
james
ryan
s
cabin
one
was
an
old
man
bearded
and
wrinkled
whose
brows
were
continually
contracting
as
is
the
habit
with
those
who
live
by
the
sea
and
look
on
the
wrath
of
many
winds
he
was
dressed
in
a
white
wrapper
a
woollen
shirt
open
at
the
neck
trousers
folded
up
to
the
knees
and
mairteens
the
other
was
a
youth
of
nineteen
supple
of
limb
and
barefooted
in
the
two
men
a
family
likeness
might
be
detected
they
were
father
and
son
james
ryan
and
his
only
boy
fergus
there
were
now
only
four
in
the
family
death
had
taken
away
most
of
the
children
before
they
were
a
year
old
fergus
opened
the
door
of
the
cabin
to
be
met
with
the
warm
and
penetrating
breath
of
the
cattle
inside
the
cows
always
curious
to
see
a
turned
round
in
their
beds
of
fresh
heather
and
fixed
their
big
soft
eyes
on
the
youth
beside
the
cow
nearest
the
door
a
young
calf
spotted
black
and
white
turned
round
on
long
lank
awkward
legs
and
sniffed
suspiciously
then
finding
that
no
danger
was
going
to
befall
him
snuggled
up
against
his
mother
who
commenced
to
lick
her
offspring
with
a
big
rough
tongue
suddenly
a
pig
ran
in
from
the
outside
rushed
between
the
youth
s
legs
and
disappeared
under
the
bed
its
back
was
bleeding
as
if
a
dog
had
bitten
it
is
not
the
pig
s
flesh
like
a
human
s
said
fergus
turning
to
his
father
white
almost
without
hair
and
it
bleeds
just
like
a
man
s
i
hate
pigs
i
wish
we
could
live
without
keeping
them
oh
here
is
norah
at
the
fire
have
you
just
got
up
the
child
shivering
from
cold
was
sitting
on
the
hassock
her
hands
spread
out
to
the
peat
blaze
she
has
only
just
come
in
from
the
other
side
of
the
water
said
the
mother
who
was
sitting
up
in
bed
knitting
stockings
she
lay
out
all
night
poor
creature
women
in
all
were
lying
out
on
the
snow
and
she
got
no
yarn
thanks
be
to
god
but
it
s
a
bad
a
bad
time
a
hard
time
a
very
hard
time
said
the
old
man
sitting
down
on
an
upturned
creel
and
taking
off
his
mairteens
no
yarn
and
there
was
not
a
fish
in
all
the
seas
last
none
but
the
ones
we
didn
t
catch
said
fergus
it
is
that
dirty
of
a
boat
that
is
to
blame
are
you
cold
norah
i
am
only
shivering
but
the
fire
will
do
me
she
didn
t
ate
one
bit
of
her
breakfast
yesterday
said
the
mother
left
it
all
for
you
when
you
came
in
from
the
sea
she
did
norah
blushed
as
if
she
had
been
caught
doing
something
wrong
then
drank
from
the
bowl
of
milk
which
was
placed
on
the
floor
beside
her
the
father
looked
greedily
at
the
bowl
the
mother
spoke
it
is
nice
and
warm
that
milk
said
the
old
woman
i
wish
we
had
more
of
it
but
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
milk
runs
thin
in
the
cow
s
elldurs
but
even
if
we
had
got
enough
bread
never
mind
milk
it
would
not
be
so
bad
and
there
is
not
one
bit
for
you
this
morning
do
you
know
what
the
soggarth
says
shemus
ii
the
husband
looked
at
his
wife
and
an
expression
of
dread
appeared
on
his
face
what
does
he
say
mary
he
is
offering
up
no
prayers
for
your
mother
of
god
be
good
to
me
you
must
pay
him
that
pound
at
once
he
but
barring
what
we
are
saving
up
for
the
landlord
s
rent
bad
scran
to
him
we
have
not
one
white
shilling
in
the
that
does
not
matter
to
the
priest
the
damned
old
pig
exclaimed
fergus
who
had
been
looking
gloomily
at
the
roof
since
he
had
spoken
to
norah
fergus
the
three
occupants
of
the
house
exclaimed
in
one
breath
what
s
coming
over
the
boy
at
all
the
mother
went
on
it
must
be
the
books
that
micky
s
jim
takes
over
from
scotland
that
are
bringing
ruin
to
the
it
is
common
sense
that
i
am
talking
fergus
hotly
replied
what
with
the
landlord
farley
mckeown
and
the
priest
you
are
all
in
a
nice
pickle
the
priest
fergus
robbing
you
because
he
is
a
servant
of
the
lord
that
is
the
priest
s
trick
the
youth
exclaimed
we
are
feeding
here
with
the
cows
and
the
pigs
and
we
are
not
one
bit
better
than
the
animals
ourselves
i
hate
the
place
i
hate
it
and
everything
about
sure
you
don
t
hate
your
own
people
asked
norah
rising
from
her
seat
and
going
timidly
up
to
her
brother
sure
you
don
t
hate
me
fergus
hate
you
laughed
the
young
man
stroking
her
hair
with
an
awkward
hand
no
one
could
hate
you
because
you
are
a
little
angel
now
run
away
and
sit
down
at
the
fire
and
warm
yourself
they
are
going
to
make
you
a
nun
they
there
was
a
note
of
scorn
in
his
voice
and
he
looked
defiantly
at
his
mother
as
he
spoke
what
better
than
a
nun
could
she
be
asked
the
mother
i
would
rather
see
her
a
beggar
on
the
rainy
what
is
coming
over
you
atall
fergus
asked
the
old
man
last
night
too
you
were
strange
in
your
talk
on
the
top
of
the
how
much
money
have
you
in
the
house
fergus
asked
taking
no
heed
of
his
father
s
remark
ten
shillings
will
be
enough
to
take
me
out
of
the
country
fergus
what
are
you
saying
asked
his
mother
i
am
going
away
from
here
and
i
am
going
to
push
my
he
looked
out
of
the
window
and
his
eyes
followed
the
twist
of
the
road
that
ran
like
a
ribbon
away
past
the
door
of
the
house
but
fergus
dear
it
does
not
matter
maghair
mother
what
you
say
remarked
the
youth
interrupting
his
mother
i
am
going
away
this
very
day
i
have
had
it
in
my
head
for
a
long
while
i
ll
make
you
rich
in
the
years
to
come
i
ll
earn
plenty
of
that
s
what
they
all
say
child
the
mother
interposed
and
tears
came
into
her
eyes
it
s
more
often
a
grave
than
a
fortune
they
find
in
the
black
foreign
could
any
place
under
the
of
heaven
be
as
black
as
this
asked
the
youth
excitedly
there
is
nothing
here
but
rags
poverty
and
dirt
pigs
under
the
bed
cows
in
the
house
the
rain
coming
through
the
thatch
instead
of
seeping
from
the
eaves
and
the
winds
of
night
raving
and
roaring
through
wall
and
window
then
if
by
chance
you
make
one
gold
guinea
half
of
it
goes
to
farley
mckeown
and
the
priest
and
the
other
half
of
it
goes
to
the
but
farley
mckeown
doesn
t

us
at
all
said
the
mother
in
a
tone
of
reproof
it
is
him
that
gives
us
money
for
the
knitting
exclaimed
fergus
rising
to
his
feet
and
striding
up
and
down
the
cabin
god
look
sideways
on
the
knitting
how
much
are
you
paid
for
your
work
one
shilling
and
threepence
for
a
dozen
pairs
of
stockings
that
takes
the
two
of
you
more
than
a
whole
week
to
make
you
might
as
well
be
slaves
you
are
slaves
slaves
to
the
very
middle
of
your
bones
how

shillings
a
pair
i
am
after
hearing

penny
farthing
a

of
the
books
that

with
the
harvestmen
you
would
not
suffer
farley
mckeown
for
that
is
it
said
the
mother
winding
the
thread
round
her
that
is
it
it
is
the
books
that
the
harvestmen
take
home
that
puts
the
boy
astray
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
priest
condemns
the
the
priest
said
the
youth
in
a
tone
of
contempt
but
what
is
the
good
of
talking
to
the
likes
of
you
how
much
money
have
you
in
the
house
sure
you
are
not
going
to

exclaimed
gazing
with
large
troubled
eyes
at
her
brother

evening

piles
of

end
of
every
james
ryan
looked
at
his
wife
and
a
similar
thought
struck
both
of
them
at
the
same
instant
the
son
had
some
book
learning
and
he
might
get
on
well
abroad
and
amass
considerable
wealth
which
he
would
share
with
his
own
people
the
old
man
drew
nearer
to
the
fire
and
held
out
his
bare
feet
which
were
blue
with
cold
to
the
flames
if
fergus
sends
home
money
i
ll
get
a
good
strong
and
warm
pair
of
boots
he
said
to
himself
then
asked
how
much
money
is
there
in
the
teapot
mary
twelve
white
shillings
and
sevenpence
answered
the
wife
no
it
is
only
twelve
shillings
and
sixpence
norah
took
a
penny
with
her
to
the
town
i
have
a
ha
penny
back
with
me
said
the
child
drawing
a
coin
from
her
purse
i
only
spent
half
of
the
money
on
bread
yesterday
because
i
was
not
very
god
be
merciful
to
us
but
the
child
is
starving
herself
said
the
old
woman
clutching
eagerly
at
the
coin
which
her
daughter
held
towards
her
you
can
have
half
a
gold
guinea
fergus
if
you
are
going
out
to
push
your
iii
in
the
evening
when
the
moon
peeped
over
the
western
hills
fergus
ryan
tied
his
boots
round
his
neck
placed
three
bannocks
in
a
woollen
handkerchief
and
went
out
from
his
father
s
door
the
mother
wept
not
when
he
was
leaving
she
had
seen
so
many
of
her
children
go
out
on
a
much
longer
journey
norah
accompanied
fergus
for
a
short
distance
and
stopped
where
the
road
streaked
with
very
faint
lines
of
light
merged
into
the
darkness
the
moon
rose
clear
off
the
hills
lights
could
be
seen
glowing
in
the
distance
a
leafless
birch
waved
its
arms
in
the
breeze
somewhere
a
cow
was
lowing
and
far
away
across
the
water
a
ballybonar
dog
howled
at
the
stars
i
never
thought
that
i
could
like
the
place
as
much
as
i
do
now
fergus
said
in
english
it
s
the
way
with
everyone
when
they
re
going
away
answered
his
sister
and
i
m
sick
at
heart
that
ye
are
goin
fergus
is
derry
far
away
a
longish
way
out
beyont
the
moon
is
it
asked
the
child
pointing
at
the
hills
and
the
moon
above
them
maybe
said
the
youth
then
in
a
low
voice
d
ye
know
what
they
do
in
other
countries
when
they
are
saying
then
i
don
t
answered
norah
they
do
this
said
the
young
man
and
he
pressed
his
lips
against
his
sister
s
cheek
but
they
never
do
that
here
said
the
girl
and
both
blushed
as
if
they
had
been
discovered
doing
something
very
wrong
i
ll
say
a
long
prayer
for
you
every
night
when
you
are
away
the
boy
looked
at
her
rubbed
one
bare
foot
on
the
ground
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
saying
something
further
then
without
a
word
he
turned
and
walked
off
along
the
wet
road
norah
kept
looking
after
him
till
he
was
out
of
sight
then
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
she
went
back
to
her
home
chapter
v
good
news
from
a
far
country
i
towards
the
end
of
the
following
year
a
great
event
took
place
in
frosses
it
was
reported
that
a
registered
letter
addressed
to
james
ryan
esquire
meenalicknalore
was
lying
in
frosses
norah
heard
the
news
and
spoke
of
it
to
her
father
no
one
but
your
own
self
can
get
the
letter
she
said
that
is
what
the
people
at
the
say
you
have
to
write
your
name
down
on
white
paper
too
before
the
letter
crosses
the
and
is
it
me
a
man
who
was
never
at
school
that
has
to
put
down
my
name
asked
james
ryan
in
a
puzzled
voice
it
will
be
a
letter
from
the
boy
himself
said
the
old
woman
who
was
sitting
up
in
bed
and
knitting
now
and
again
she
placed
her
bright
irons
down
and
coughed
with
such
violence
as
to
shake
her
whole
body
and
maybe
there
is
money
in
the
same
letter
it
is
not
often
that
we
have
a
letter
coming
to
we
had
none
since
the
last
process
for
the
rent
and
that
was
two
years
aback
said
the
husband
maybe
i
will
be
going
into
frosses
and
getting
that
letter
myself
maybe
you
would
stammered
his
wife
still
battling
with
her
cough
james
ryan
put
on
his
mairteens
and
left
the
house
norah
watched
him
depart
and
her
eyes
followed
him
until
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
road
then
she
went
to
the
bedside
and
sitting
on
a
low
stool
commenced
to
turn
the
heel
of
a
long
stocking
how
many
days
to
a
day
now
is
it
since
fergus
took
the
road
to
derry
asked
the
old
woman
i
am
sure
it
is
near
come
nine
months
this
very
it
is
ten
months
all
but
sixteen
under
god
the
day
and
the
night
and
is
it
that
that
it
is
and
every
hour
of
he
will
be
across
the
whole
flat
world
since
he
left
said
the
mother
looking
fixedly
at
an
awkward
ungainly
calf
which
had
just
blundered
into
the
house
but
seeing
far
beyond
he
will
maybe
send
five
pounds
in
gold
in
the
maybe
but
you
are
not
thinking
of
that
mother
said
norah
and
what
would
be
thinking
of
then
asked
the
old
woman
i
am
wondering
if
he
is
in
good
health
and
the
young
are
always
happy
norah
are
you
not
sometimes
i
am
happy
when
out
in
the
open
listening
to
the
birds
singing
and
the
wind
running
on
the
who
ever
heard
of
a
person
listening
to
things
like
those
are
you
not
happy
in
god
s
house
on
a
sunday
oh
i
am
happy
there
as
well
answered
norah
but
there
was
a
hint
of
hesitation
in
the
answer
everyone
that
is
good
of
heart
is
happy
in
god
s
house
said
the
mother
have
you
turned
the
heel
of
the
stocking
yet
i
am
nigh
finished
with
the
foot
my
own
two
eyes
are
getting
dim
and
i
can
not
hurry
like
you
these
days
said
the
woman
in
the
bed
run
those
hens
from
the
house
and
the
young
sturk
too
i
wonder
what
he
is
coming
in
here
for
now
the
rascal
maybe
he
likes
to
be
near
the
fire
said
the
child
looking
at
the
spotted
calf
that
was
nosing
at
a
dish
on
the
dresser
when
micky
s
jim
built
a
new
byre
it
was
not
easy
to
keep
the
cattle
in
it
for
they
always
wanted
to
get
back
into
the
warm
house
with
these
words
she
rose
and
chased
the
young
animal
out
of
doors
while
a
few
stray
hens
fluttered
wildly
about
in
making
their
exit
the
cows
like
the
blaze
norah
went
on
as
she
came
back
and
took
up
her
seat
by
the
fire
every
evening
they
turn
round
and
look
at
it
and
you
can
see
their
big
soft
eyes
shining
through
the
it
is
the
strange
things
that
you
be
noticing
alannah
but
what
you
say
is
very
true
said
the
mother
it
will
be
a
letter
from
fergus
i
suppose
with
five
gold
guineas
in
it
she
went
on
maybe
he
will
be
at
the
back
of
america
by
now
if
he
sends
five
gold
guineas
we
will
make
a
holy
nun
of
you
norah
and
then
you
can
pray
day
and
night
with
no
one
at
all
to
ask
you
to
do
anything
but
that
i
might
get
tired
of
it
son
of
mary
listen
to
her
tired
of
saying
your
prayers
you
mean
there
is
that
sturk
at
the
door
again
isn
t
he
the
rascal
of
the
world
ii
darkness
had
fallen
before
james
ryan
returned
from
frosses
which
was
over
four
miles
away
he
entered
the
cabin
breathing
heavily
the
sweat
streaming
from
his
brow
and
coursing
down
his
cheeks
he
had
run
most
of
the
way
back
and
in
his
hand
he
carried
the
letter
the
first
which
he
had
received
for
two
whole
years
mercy
be
on
us
but
you
are
out
of
breath
said
his
wife
laying
down
her
knitting
irons
a
fault
of
which
she
was
seldom
guilty
save
when
eating
or
sleeping
put
one
of
the
rushlights
in
the
fire
norah
and
read
the
letter
from
foreign
parts
is
it
from
the
boy
himself
maybe
it
is
answered
the
man
seating
himself
as
usual
on
an
upturned
creel
in
the
centre
of
the
cabin
the
man
at
the
micky
mcnelis
first
cousin
he
is
to
dony
mcnelis
that
works
with
farley
mckeown
says
that
it
is
from
a
far
part
anyway
you
must
put
down
your
own
name
said
micky
to
me
in
english
i
can
not
write
for
i
never
had
a
pen
in
my
hand
said
i
you
have
to
make
your
mark
then
said
he
i
don
t
know
how
to
do
that
either
said
i
i
ll
write
your
name
and
you
have
to
put
a
line
down
this
way
and
a
line
down
that
way
after
what
i
write
said
he
and
just
by
way
of
showing
me
he
made
a
crooked
cross
with
his
pen
on
a
piece
of
paper
then
i
made
my
mark
and
a
good
mark
it
was
too
for
micky
himself
said
as
much
and
i
got
the
letter
there
and
then
into
my
own
two
hands
if
it
is
from
the
boy
there
is
not
one
penny
piece
in
why
would
you
be
saying
that
now
i
could
not
feel
anything
inside
of
it
said
the
man
if
there
were
gold
pieces
in
it
i
could
easily
find
them
through
that
piece
of
the
rushlight
was
now
ready
the
father
took
it
in
his
hand
and
stood
beside
norah
to
whom
he
gave
the
letter
the
woman
leant
forward
in
the
bed
her
husband
held
up
the
light
with
a
shaky
hand
dim
shadows
danced
on
the
roof
the
young
sturk
again
entered
the
house
and
took
up
his
stand
in
the
corner
norah
having
opened
the
letter
proceeded
to
read
dear
father
and
mother
and
norah
i
am
writing
to
say
that
i
am
well
hoping
to
find
you
all
at
home
in
the
same
state
of
health
i
am
far
away
in
the
middle
of
england
now
in
a
place
called
liverpool
where
i
have
a
job
as
a
dock
labourer
micky
s
jim
had
that
kind
of
job
the
year
before
last
in
glasgow
said
the
mother
the
work
is
hard
enough
heaven
knows
but
the
pay
is
good
i
came
here
from
derry
and
i
have
been
working
for
the
most
part
of
the
time
ever
since
i
intended
to
write
home
sooner
but
between
one
thing
and
another
time
passed
by
but
now
i
am
sending
you
home
twelve
pounds
and
you
can
get
gold
in
frosses
for
the
slip
of
paper
which
i
enclose
under
god
the
day
and
the
night
exclaimed
the
woman
in
the
bed
a
pound
of
this
money
is
for
norah
and
she
can
buy
a
new
dress
for
it
see
and
don
t
let
her
go
to
greenanore
for
yarn
any
more
or
it
will
be
the
death
of
her
sleeping
out
at
night
on
the
rocks
of
dooey
i
hope
my
mother
is
well
and
that
her
cold
is
getting
better
i
spend
all
my
spare
time
reading
books
it
is
a
great
great
world
once
you
are
away
from
donegal
and
here
where
i
am
as
many
books
as
one
would
want
to
carry
can
be
had
for
a
mere
song
getting
things
for
a
song
said
the
man
that
is
like
the
ballad
singers
it
would
be
nice
to
hear
from
you
but
as
i
am
going
away
to
america
on
the
day
after
i
have
no
fixed
address
and
it
would
be
next
to
useless
for
you
to
write
to
me
i
ll
send
a
letter
soon
again
and
more
money
when
i
can
earn
it
your
loving
son
iii
this
is
the
paper
which
he
talks
about
said
norah
handing
a
money
order
to
her
mother
a
thing
like
that
worth
twelve
pounds
exclaimed
the
old
woman
a
look
of
perplexity
intensifying
the
wrinkles
of
her
face
i
would
hardly
give
a
white
sixpence
no
nor
a
brown
penny
for
the
little
thing
glory
be
to
god
but
maybe
it
is
worth
twelve
golden
sovereigns
for
there
are
many
strange
things
that
come
out
of
foreign
alive
and
well
he
is
said
norah
reading
the
letter
over
again
thank
god
for
that
for
i
was
afraid
that
he
might
be
dead
seeing
that
it
took
him
so
long
to
write
home
wouldn
t
i
like
to
see
him
again
it
will
be
worth
twelve
pounds
without
a
doubt
said
the
husband
referring
to
the
money
order
as
he
threw
the
rushlight
which
was
burning
his
fingers
into
the
fire
i
once
heard
tell
that
a
man
can
get
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
guineas
for
a
piece
of
paper
no
bigger
than
that
mother
of
god
exclaimed
the
old
woman
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
kissing
the
money
order
rapturously
poor
fergus
said
norah
laying
down
the
letter
on
the
and
taking
up
her
needles
it
is
a
pity
of
him
so
far
away
from
his
own
home
twelve
gold
sovereigns
said
the
mother
a
big
pile
that
without
a
doubt
hardly
a
house
in
frosses
has
twelve
pounds
inside
the
threshold
of
its
door
put
out
that
animal
to
the
fields
she
called
to
her
husband
we
ll
have
to
build
a
new
byre
and
not
have
the
cattle
in
the
house
any
longer
a
funny
thing
indeed
to
have
them
tied
up
in
a
house
along
with
people
who
can
get
twelve
pounds
in
bulk
from
foreign
parts
no
decent
body
would
dream
of
such
a
thing
as
having
them
tied
up
here
now
norah
leave
down
that
stocking
let
me
never
see
you
knitting
under
this
roof
why
mother
you
are
going
to
be
a
nun
a
holy
nun
norah
and
nuns
never
knit
they
just
pray
all
day
long
and
all
night
too
you
have
to
set
about
and
go
to
school
again
you
are
not
to
be
like
other
people
s
children
any
more
knitting
stockings
in
the
ashes
you
are
going
to
be
a
nun
and
there
never
was
a
nun
in
frosses
yet
i
would
like
to
go
to
school
again
said
the
child
clinking
her
irons
nervously
and
following
with
her
eyes
the
blue
flames
that
rose
from
the
peat
fire
and
disappeared
in
the
chimney
there
is
a
map
of
the
world
in
the
school
hanging
on
the
wall
and
one
can
see
liverpool
on
it
and
america
as
well
i
could
look
at
them
and
think
that
i
am
seeing
fergus
away
in
foreign
parts
so
far
from
his
own
and
there
is
a
pound
due
to
the
priest
this
minute
said
the
old
man
who
had
just
chased
the
calf
out
into
the
darkness
it
would
be
well
to
give
the
soggarth
the
money
in
the
and
you
ll
go
to
school
again
repeated
the
mother
who
was
following
up
some
train
of
thought
and
who
curiously
enough
made
no
mention
of
her
son
since
the
letter
had
been
read
you
ll
go
again
and
learn
well
the
master
said
that
you
were
getting
on
fine
the
last
time
you
were
there
and
that
it
was
a
sin
to
take
you
away
from
the
having
said
this
the
old
woman
lay
back
in
her
bed
with
a
sigh
of
relief
the
man
closed
the
door
of
the
house
and
drawing
near
to
the
fire
he
held
out
his
feet
to
the
blaze
norah
glad
to
be
released
from
the
labour
of
the
knitting
irons
looked
into
the
flames
and
many
strange
pictures
came
and
went
before
her
eyes
from
time
to
time
the
woman
in
the
bed
could
be
heard
speaking
twelve
pounds
for
a
piece
of
paper
she
would
exclaim
mother
of
god
but
there
is
strange
things
in
foreign
lands
suddenly
norah
arose
and
approached
the
bed
am
i
a
good
girl
mother
she
asked
with
a
slight
catch
in
her
voice
what
silliness
is
entering
your
head
enquired
the
old
woman
who
said
that
you
were
not
good
you
said
that
good
people
were
happy
in
god
s
house
but
i
am
not
always
happy
did
i
say
that
asked
the
mother
who
had
forgotten
all
about
the
remark
maybe
i
did
say
it
maybe
indeed
but
run
away
now
and
don
t
bother
me
for
i
am
going
to
a
little
bit
of
paper
to
be
worth
twelve
pounds
she
mumbled
to
herself
after
a
short
interval
of
silence
mother
of
god
but
there
are
many
strange
things
in
foreign
parts
of
the
world
chapter
vi
school
life
i
on
the
monday
of
the
week
following
norah
ryan
went
to
school
again
she
had
been
there
for
two
years
already
but
left
off
going
when
she
became
an
adept
at
the
needles
master
diver
had
control
of
the
school
he
was
a
fat
little
man
always
panting
and
perspiring
who
frightened
the
children
and
feared
the
priest
on
the
way
to
school
he
cut
hazel
rods
by
the
roadside
and
when
in
a
bad
mood
he
used
them
on
the
youngsters
after
he
had
caned
three
or
four
children
he
became
good
tempered
when
he
caned
half
a
dozen
he
got
tired
of
his
task
and
allowed
the
remainder
if
any
remained
to
go
scot
free
some
of
the
boys
who
worked
in
their
spare
time
at
peat
saving
and
fishing
had
hands
hard
as
horses
hooves
when
these
did
something
wrong
their
trousers
were
taken
down
and
awkward
chastisement
was
inflicted
with
severe
simplicity
in
full
view
of
a
breathless
school
the
school
consisted
of
a
single
apartment
at
one
end
of
which
on
a
slightly
elevated
platform
near
the
fire
the
master
s
desk
and
chair
were
placed
several
maps
two
blackboards
a
modulator
which
no
one
not
even
the
master
himself
understood
and
a
thermometer
long
deprived
of
its
quicksilver
hung
on
the
walls
in
one
corner
were
the
pegs
on
which
the
boys
caps
were
hung
on
a
large
which
spanned
the
width
of
the
room
the
girls
shawls
were
piled
in
a
large
heap
the
room
boasted
of
two
wide
open
fireplaces
but
only
one
of
these
was
ever
lighted
the
other
was
used
for
storing
the
turf
carried
to
school
daily
by
the
scholars
the
room
was
swept
twice
weekly
then
a
grey
dust
rose
off
the
floor
and
the
master
and
children
were
seized
with
prolonged
fits
of
sneezing
outside
and
above
the
door
was
a
large
plate
with
the
inscription
glenmornan
national
school
over
the
plate
and
under
the
eaves
of
the
building
a
sparrow
built
its
nest
yearly
and
it
was
even
reported
that
a
bat
took
up
its
daily
residence
in
the
same
quarter
from
his
seat
beside
the
fire
in
the
schoolroom
the
master
watched
his
pupils
through
eyes
save
when
now
and
again
he
dropped
into
a
sound
sleep
and
snored
loudly
asleep
he
perspired
more
freely
than
when
awake
he
was
very
bald
and
sometimes
a
tame
robin
that
had
been
in
the
schoolhouse
for
many
years
fluttered
down
and
rested
on
the
skinny
head
which
shone
brilliantly
in
the
firelight
there
the
robin
preened
its
feathers
now
and
then
a
mouse
nibbled
under
the
boards
of
the
floor
and
the
children
stopped
their
noisy
chatter
for
a
moment
to
listen
to
the
movements
of
the
little
animal
prayers
were
said
morning
and
evening
the
children
went
down
on
their
knees
the
master
prayed
standing
like
a
priest
at
the
altar
the
prayers
of
the
morning
were
repeated
in
english
those
of
the
evening
in
gaelic
norah
ryan
took
her
place
in
the
third
standard
in
the
class
the
boys
stood
at
top
the
girls
at
bottom
and
those
of
each
sex
were
ranged
in
order
of
merit
norah
an
apt
pupil
easily
took
her
place
at
the
head
of
the
girls
and
the
most
ignorant
of
the
boys
a
youth
named
dermod
flynn
was
placed
beside
her
although
this
lad
got
caned
on
an
average
three
times
a
day
he
never
cried
when
he
was
beaten
still
norah
ryan
felt
mutely
compassionate
for
him
when
she
heard
the
sharp
hazel
rod
strike
like
a
whiplash
against
his
hand
his
usual
punishment
consisted
of
four
slaps
of
the
rod
but
always
he
held
out
his
hand
for
a
fifth
this
no
doubt
was
done
to
show
the
master
that
he
did
not
fear
him
dermod
could
not
fix
his
mind
on
any
one
subject
there
was
usually
a
look
in
his
eyes
which
were
continually
turning
towards
the
window
and
the
country
outside
on
the
calf
of
his
left
leg
a
large
red
scar
showed
where
he
had
been
bitten
by
a
dog
and
it
was
known
that
he
would
become
mad
one
day
when
a
man
is
bitten
by
an
angry
dog
he
is
sure
to
become
mad
at
some
time
or
another
so
they
say
in
frosses
the
third
class
was
usually
ranged
for
lessons
in
a
facing
the
map
of
the
world
which
with
the
exception
of
the
map
of
ireland
was
the
largest
in
the
school
on
the
corners
of
the
map
were
pictures
of
various
men
and
animals
with
titles
underneath
which
going
the
round
of
the
two
hemispheres
could
be
read
as
follows
dromedary
a
russian
moujik
wild
boar
a
chinaman
leopard
an
indian
lion
a
fiji
islander
etc
ii
one
day
the
master
asked
dermod
flynn
if
he
knew
what
race
of
people
lived
in
liverpool
as
usual
dermod
did
not
know
dockers
and
irishmen
norah
ryan
whose
mind
reverted
to
the
letter
which
had
been
received
from
fergus
whispered
under
her
breath
rockets
and
irishmen
dermod
blurted
out
no
one
laughed
a
rocket
had
never
been
seen
in
glenmornan
and
it
would
have
surprised
none
of
the
children
if
dermod
were
correct
it
would
have
surprised
none
of
them
if
he
were
wrong
the
master
reached
for
the
hazel
rod
hold
out
your
hand
dermod
flynn
he
commanded
and
delivered
four
blows
on
the
boy
s
palm
flynn
held
out
his
hand
for
a
fifth
slap
the
master
took
no
notice
now
norah
ryan
hold
out
your
hand
said
the
master
promptin
is
worse
than
tellin
norah
received
two
slaps
much
lighter
than
those
delivered
to
the
boy
the
master
knew
that
she
was
going
to
be
a
nun
one
day
and
he
respected
her
accordingly
but
not
to
such
an
extent
that
he
could
refrain
from
using
the
rod
of
correction
dermod
flynn
turned
and
stared
at
norah
a
red
blush
mantled
her
cheeks
and
she
looked
at
him
shyly
for
a
moment
then
her
lashes
dropped
quickly
for
she
felt
that
he
was
looking
into
her
very
soul
he
appeared
impervious
to
the
pain
of
the
master
s
chastisement
after
a
while
norah
looked
at
him
again
but
he
was
gazing
vacantly
out
of
the
window
at
a
brook
tumbling
from
the
rocky
hills
that
fringed
the
further
side
of
the
playground
when
school
was
dismissed
and
the
scholars
were
on
their
way
home
dermod
spoke
to
norah
why
did
you
help
me
in
the
class
he
asked
she
did
not
answer
but
turned
away
and
stared
at
the
stream
falling
from
the
dark
rocks
it
s
like
white
smoke
against
a
black
cloud
he
said
following
her
gaze
what
is
the
stream
falling
from
the
on
the
day
following
dermod
got
into
trouble
again
his
class
was
asked
to
write
an
essay
on
fire
and
dermod
sat
biting
his
pen
until
the
allotted
time
was
nearly
finished
then
he
scribbled
down
a
few
lines
a
house
without
fire
is
like
a
man
without
a
stomach
a
chimney
without
smoke
is
like
a
man
without
breath
for
that
was
all
dermod
pondered
over
the
word
stomach
for
a
while
and
felt
that
it
made
the
whole
sentence
an
unseemly
one
he
was
stroking
out
the
word
when
the
master
awakening
from
his
sleep
grabbed
the
essay
and
read
it
he
read
it
a
second
time
then
took
down
a
hazel
rod
from
the
nail
on
which
it
hung
the
ignorance
of
the
boy
who
wrote
such
a
sentence
was
most
profound
the
master
caned
dermod
norah
ryan
made
rapid
progress
at
her
work
and
when
she
went
home
in
the
evening
she
sat
down
on
the
hassock
and
learned
her
lessons
by
the
light
of
the
peat
fire
she
considered
old
master
diver
to
be
a
very
learned
man
but
somehow
she
could
not
get
herself
to
like
him
why
does
he
beat
dermod
flynn
so
often
she
asked
herself
time
and
again
and
whenever
she
thought
of
school
she
thought
of
dermod
flynn
her
mother
who
had
improved
in
health
now
that
there
was
food
to
eat
brought
a
from
greenanore
one
day
she
paid
fourpence
halfpenny
for
it
in
mckeown
s
great
emporium
the
new
business
which
had
just
been
started
by
the
yarn
merchant
norah
dressed
her
hair
in
front
of
this
glass
and
one
day
when
engaged
in
the
task
she
said
i
wish
i
could
see
dermod
flynn
now
perhaps
she
really
meant
to
say
i
wish
dermod
flynn
could
see
me
now
in
any
case
she
got
so
red
in
the
face
that
her
mother
asked
her
what
was
wrong
shortly
afterwards
dermod
flynn
s
school
troubles
came
to
an
end
his
class
was
standing
as
usual
facing
the
map
of
the
world
and
master
diver
asked
dermod
to
point
out
corsica
the
boy
did
not
know
where
corsica
was
he
stared
at
the
map
holding
the
idle
pointer
in
his
hand
point
out
corsica
the
master
repeated
and
seized
the
youth
by
the
ear
which
he
pulled
vigorously
the
blood
mounted
to
the
boy
s
cheeks
and
raising
the
pointer
suddenly
he
hit
the
master
sharply
across
the
face
you
ve
killed
him
dermod
flynn
norah
ryan
gasped
involuntarily
the
old
fellow
put
his
hands
over
his
face
and
sank
down
limply
on
the
form
blood
trickled
through
his
fingers
a
fly
settled
on
his
bald
head
the
scholars
stared
aghast
at
their
fallen
master
dermod
gazed
at
the
old
man
for
a
moment
then
seizing
his
cap
he
rushed
out
of
the
schoolroom
most
of
the
boys
followed
the
example
and
when
the
master
who
only
suffered
from
a
slight
flesh
wound
regained
his
feet
and
looked
round
the
school
was
almost
deserted
dermod
flynn
did
not
return
again
and
after
his
departure
norah
found
that
she
did
not
like
the
school
so
much
as
formerly
chapter
vii
plucking
i
the
may
of
came
round
and
on
every
twelfth
day
of
may
the
young
boys
and
girls
of
donegal
start
for
the
hiring
fair
of
strabane
the
rumour
went
that
dermod
flynn
was
going
now
but
no
one
knew
for
certain
the
flynns
being
a
people
gave
no
secrets
away
on
the
evening
preceding
the
twelfth
norah
heard
of
dermod
s
intended
departure
and
that
night
she
was
long
in
falling
asleep
her
bed
was
made
on
the
floor
beside
the
fire
a
grey
woollen
blanket
served
a
double
debt
to
pay
and
was
used
as
a
blanket
and
sheet
but
the
sleeping
place
was
not
cold
the
heat
of
the
fire
and
the
breath
of
the
kine
kept
it
warm
the
first
bird
was
twittering
on
the
thatch
and
the
first
tint
of
dawn
was
tingeing
the
sky
when
norah
awoke
sat
up
in
bed
and
threw
part
of
the
blanket
aside
at
the
further
end
of
the
house
where
it
was
still
dark
cattle
were
stamping
and
bright
eyes
could
be
seen
glowing
like
coals
the
child
rose
went
to
the
window
pulled
up
the
blind
and
looked
out
on
the
sea
she
stood
there
for
a
moment
rapt
in
reverie
her
pure
white
bosom
showing
above
her
cotton
chemise
and
her
long
tresses
hanging
down
loosely
over
her
shoulders
she
was
now
fourteen
her
short
reverie
came
to
an
end
she
crossed
herself
many
times
and
proceeded
to
dress
taking
unusual
care
with
her
hair
weaving
it
into
two
long
plaits
and
polishing
her
boots
carefully
these
the
second
pair
of
her
life
were
studded
with
nails
which
she
liked
to
hear
rasping
on
the
ground
as
she
walked
at
night
she
noticed
that
the
nails
were
bright
and
shiny
in
the
mornings
they
were
always
brown
with
rust
she
recollected
not
without
a
certain
amount
of
satisfaction
that
she
was
the
only
girl
wearing
shoes
at
frosses
school
but
she
could
well
afford
it
fergus
had
sent
twenty
pounds
to
his
parents
and
three
pounds
to
herself
since
he
left
home
her
father
and
mother
were
asleep
in
the
bed
the
former
snoring
loudly
the
latter
coughing
drowsily
from
time
to
time
the
cat
which
had
been
in
the
house
since
norah
could
remember
was
curled
atop
of
the
blanket
and
fast
asleep
a
movement
occurred
in
the
bed
as
norah
finished
her
toilet
the
cat
stirred
itself
stretched
its
front
legs
spreading
out
its
claws
yawned
and
fell
asleep
again
son
of
mary
but
you
are
up
early
norah
exclaimed
her
mother
sitting
up
in
bed
then
seeing
the
cat
she
gave
the
blankets
a
vigorous
shake
and
cried
get
out
you
little
devil
you
lie
in
bed
as
if
you
were
a
person
and
no
less
i
am
going
to
pull
on
the
hills
of
glenmornan
for
your
sickness
but

it
not
be
time

for
you
to
go
there
come
noon

as
well
to

the
old
woman

cattle
into
the
holm
below
the
holy
rocks
before
you
go
i
will
do
that
and

the
blind
up
on
the
window

light

into

the
cattle
from
their
stakes
and
opened
the
door
the
old
brindled
cow
went
out
first
lazily
lashing
her
legs
with
her
long
tail
and
smelt
the
as
she
passed
soberly
into
the
open
the
second
cow
a
beast
was
followed
by
a
restless
awkward
calf
that
mischievously
nudged
the
hindquarters
of
the
animal
in
front
with
its
nose
the
ryans
possessed
three
cattle
only
and
the
byre
which
the
old
woman
had
wanted
erected
was
now
in
process
of
construction
when
the
young
calf
got
into
the
field
he
jumped
exultantly
into
the
air
and
rushed
madly
off
for
the
distance
of
a
hundred
yards
then
planting
his
forefeet
squarely
in
the
earth
as
suddenly
stopped
and
turned
round
to
look
at
the
two
cows
surprised
that
they
had
not
followed
him
he
scampered
back
to
where
they
were
cropping
noisily
at
the
short
grass
and
with
his
head
dunted
the
brindled
cow
on
the
belly
the
old
animal
turned
round
her
mouth
full
of
grass
and
gave
a
reproving
nudge
with
her
warm
damp
nose
which
sent
the
calf
scampering
off
again
the
houses
of
meenalicknalore
were
arranged
in
a
row
on
the
top
of
a
brae
that
swept
down
to
the
sea
shoving
its
toes
into
the
water
a
curl
of
smoke
rose
from
some
of
the
houses
others
gave
no
hint
of
human
activity
a
chimney
without
smoke

man
without
breath

of

is
goin

supposed

said

in

in

when
her
prayers
were
finished
she
drove
the
cattle
into
a
holm
put
a
bush
in
the
gap
and
resumed
her
journey
the
sun
had
just
risen

in

a
rabbit
with

and

acock
ran
along
the
roadway
and
disappeared
under
a
clump
of
furze
clouds
floating
across
the
sky
like
large
lazy
wingless
birds
slowly
assumed
a
delicate
rosy
tint
until
they
looked
like
inside
a
giant
shell
norah
very
excited
and
very
happy
stood
for
a
moment
to
look
into
a
clear
well
by
the
roadside
on
her
face
was
the
expectant
look
of
a
sweet
kitten
that
waits
for
the
ball
to
be
thrown
to
it
her
two
plaits
of
hair
hung
over
her
shoulders
one
delicate
strand
that
had
fallen
away
fluttering
in
the
breeze
she
looked
approvingly
into
the
calm
water
at
the
laughing
face
that
smiled
up
to
her
how
good
to
be
out
here
to
be
alive
to
be
young
she
seemed
to
say
to
herself
everything
is
so
fair
so
beautiful
so
wonderful
ii
about
six
o
clock
norah
entered
glenmornan
here
she
met
three
boys
and
two
girls
bound
for
the
rabble
market
of
strabane
one
of
the
boys
was
whistling
a
tune
the
other
two
chattered
noisily
the
girls
who
were
silent
carried
each
a
pair
of
boots
hung
over
their
shoulders

journey
said
norah

by

of
salutation

they
answered

she
asked

one
of
the
girls
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
her
brow

gasairs
of
oiney
dinchy

said
the
boy
who
had
been
whistling
norah
waited
for
him
to
proceed
but
finding
that
he
remained
silent
she
enquired
as
to
who
was
going
condy
dan
hudy
neddy
columb
kennedy
unah
roarty
and
the
boy
paused
for
a
moment
to
scratch
his
head
and
dermod
flynn
the
gasair
that
struck
master
diver
with
the
well
good
luck
to

said
norah
shaking
the
hand
of
each
of
them
in
turn
may
god
be
with
ye
all
till
ye
come
back
and
with
yerself
for
the
crooked
road
twisted
round
copse
and
knoll
now
bordering
the
river
now
rising
well
up
on
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
and
along
this
road
norah
hurried
her
hands
hanging
idly
by
her
side
and
her
plaits
when
caught
by
an
errant
breeze
fluttering
over
her
shoulders
along
the
glenmornan
road
she
met
dermod
flynn
where
are
ye
for
this
mornin
dermod
she
asked
she
knew
where
he
was
going
and
after
speaking
felt
that
she
should
not
have
asked
him
that
question
beyond
the
mountains
answered
the
youth
with
a
smile
which
showed
his
white
teeth
in
one
hand
he
carried
a
bundle
in
the
other
an
with
a
heavy
knob
at
the
end
the
young
fellows
of
glenmornan
had
got
into
a
habit
of
carrying
sticks
in
imitation
of
the
cattle
drovers
who
came
once
every
month
to
the
fair
of
greenanore
ye
ll
not
come
back
for
a
long
while
will
ye
norah
asked
i
m
never
goin
to
come
back
again
dermod
answered
at
this
norah
laughed
but
strangely
enough
she
felt
ready
to
cry
all
that
she
intended
to
say
to
him
was
forgotten
she
held
out
her
hand
stammered
a
confused
and
hurried
away
his
eyes
are
on
me
now
she
said
several
times
to
herself
as
she
walked
away
and
every
time
she
spoke
a
blush
mounted
to
her
cheeks
she
wanted
to
look
back
but
did
not
do
so
until
she
came
to
the
first
bend
of
the
road
there
she
turned
round
but
dermod
flynn
had
gone
from
sight
and
a
great
loneliness
entered
the
girl
s
heart
a
steer
with
wide
curious
eyes
watched
her
from
a
field
beside
the
road
the
water
sang
a
song
all
its
own
as
it
dropped
from
the
hills
and
the
glen
river
viewed
from
the
point
where
norah
stood
looked
like
a
streak
of
silver
on
a
cloth
of
green
but
the
girl
saw
and
heard
none
of
these
things
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
crooked
road
which
ran
on
through
holt
and
hollow
as
far
as
the
village
of
greenanore
and
miles
and
miles
beyond
she
stood
there
for
a
long
time
lost
in
reverie
dermod
flynn
was
gone
now
and
he
would
never
come
back
again
so
he
had
told
her
suddenly
she
recollected
why
she
had
come
out
on
the
journey
to
pluck
it
was
she
murmured
i
am
after
forgetting
that
she
went
across
the
river
by
the
ford
and
climbed
the
hill
from
the
top
of
the
knoll
she
could
see
the
train
steam
out
from
the
station
of
greenanore
in
it
were
the
children
bound
for
the
rabble
market
of
strabane
norah
stared
and
stared
at
the
train
which
crawled
like
a
black
caterpillar
across
the
brown
moor
leaving
a
trail
of
white
smoke
behind
it
i
m
after
forgettin
that
i
came
out
to
pluck
she
repeated
when
the
train
had
disappeared
from
sight
and
taking
off
her
boots
she
picked
her
way
across
the
soft
and
spongy
moor

a
year
had
passed
by
since
james
ryan
last
heard
from
fergus
his
son
no
word
came
of
the
youth
and
none
of
the
frosses
people
great
travellers
though
the
young
of
frosses
were
had
ever
come
across
him
in
any
corner
of
the
world
we
are
missing
the
blue
pieces
of
paper
mary
ryan
said
to
her
husband
one
evening
in
the
late
autumn
fully
three
years
after
fergus
s
departure
she
now
spent
her
days
sitting
at
the
fire
and
though
her
health
was
not
the
best
it
had
greatly
improved
within
recent
years
they
were
the
papers
she
exclaimed
they
could
buy
meal
in
the
town
of
greenanore
and
pay
the
landlord
his
rent
maybe
the
gasair
is
dead
maybe
he
is
the
husband
answered
he
was
a
man
of
few
words
and
fewer
ideas
life
to
him
as
to
the
animals
of
the
fields
was
naturally
simple
he
married
became
the
father
of
many
children
all
unnecessary
to
an
overcrowded
district
and
most
of
them
were
flicked
out
by
death
before
they
were
a
year
old
once
every
eighteen
months
james
ryan
s
wife
became
suddenly
irritable
and
querulous
and
asked
her
husband
to
leave
the
house
for
a
while
the
cattle
were
allowed
to
remain
inside
the
husband
went
out
and
walked
about
in
the
vicinity
of
his
home
for
two
or
three
hours
from
time
to
time
he
would
go
up
to
the
door
and
call
out
are
you
all
right
mary
through
the
keyhole
i
am
all
right
shemus
she
would
answer
and
the
man
would
resume
his
walk
when
the
wife
allowed
him
to
come
in
he
always
found
that
his
family
had
increased
in
number
one
day
a
child
was
born
to
him
and
its
third
breath
killed
it
it
was
the
seventh
and
the
year
was
a
bad
one
potatoes
lay
rotting
in
the
fields
and
the
peat
being
wet
refused
to
burn
somehow
james
ryan
felt
a
great
relief
when
the
child
was
buried
twelve
children
in
all
were
born
to
him
and
ten
of
these
died
before
they
reached
the
age
of
three
the
hunger
took
them
i
suppose
he
said
and
never
wept
over
any
of
his
offspring
and
even
in
time
forgot
the
names
of
most
of
those
who
were
dead
the
third
who
came
to
him
was
the
boy
fergus
norah
was
the
youngest
of
all
maybe
indeed
he
is
dead
he
repeated
to
his
wife
i
suppose
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
put
out
the
curragh
to
the
fishing
and
never
catch
anything
said
his
wife
as
if
blaming
him
for
the
it
is
always
the
way
if
fergus
would
send
a
few
gold
guineas
now
it
would
be
a
great
it
would
be
a
great
we
could
keep
norah
at
school
for
another
we
and
then
send
her
to
the
convent
like
a
when
are
you
going
to
put
the
curragh
out
again
maybe
this
very
night
answered
the
husband
it
is
now
michaelmas
a
week
past
there
were
blue
lights
seen
out
beyond
the
bar
last
night
and
a
dropped
from
the
sky
and
fell
dead
on
the
rocks
of
dooey
the
same
happened
ten
years
ago
and
at
that
time
there
was
a
big
catch
out
by
then
you
had
better
go
out
for
there
is
not
much
money
in
the
this
the
byre
cost
a
big
penny
said
james
ryan
and
he
spoke
as
if
regretting
something
it
did
that
and
the
house
does
not
look
half
as
well
with
the
cattle
gone
from
so
saying
the
woman
turned
over
some
live
turf
on
the
pile
of
potatoes
that
was
toasting
beside
the
fire
and
rising
emptied
part
of
the
contents
of
a
jug
of
milk
into
a
bowl
it
is
a
wonder
that
norah
is
not
in
she
remarked
she
should
be
back
from
school
over
an
hour
ii
at
that
moment
norah
entered
placed
her
cotton
satchel
and
books
on
the
window
sill
and
sat
down
to
her
meal
she
was
a
winsome
girl
neat
delicate
and
she
had
grown
taller
her
tresses
were
glossier
her
clear
grey
eyes
out
of
which
the
radiance
of
her
pure
soul
seemed
to
shine
were
dreamy
and
thoughtful
she
was
remarkable
for
a
pure
and
exquisite
beauty
not
alone
of
body
but
of
mind
she
was
dressed
in
peasant
garb
but
her
clothes
though
patched
and
shabby
showed
the
lines
of
her
figure
to
advantage
her
feet
were
small
an
unusual
thing
amongst
country
children
who
run
about
and
her
dainty
little
hands
matched
her
feet
to
perfection
her
accomplishments
were
the
knowledge
of
a
few
irish
songs
and
country
dances
and
her
intellectual
gifts
could
be
summed
up
in
the
words
simple
innocence
are
you
getting
on
well
with
your
lessons
norah
asked
the
father
every
day
for
the
last
two
years
on
her
return
from
school
he
asked
a
similar
question
and
took
no
heed
of
the
answer
which
was
always
the
same
i
am
getting
on
very
well
he
s
going
out
to
the
fishing
said
the
mother
handing
a
bowl
of
milk
to
norah
and
pointing
her
finger
at
her
husband
any
letter
from
fergus
asked
the
girl
never
a
word
said
the
mother
maybe
one
will
be
here
never
comes
said
james
ryan
he
had
heard
somebody
use
this
phrase
years
ago
and
he
repeated
it
almost
hourly
ever
since
it
is
off
on
the
curragh
that
i
am
going
he
rose
and
went
out
the
dusk
had
fallen
and
a
heaven
of
brilliant
stars
glittered
overhead
a
light
gust
of
wind
surged
up
angrily
for
a
moment
and
swept
along
the
ground
crooning
amidst
rock
and
boulder
outside
james
ryan
stood
for
a
moment
and
looked
up
at
the
sky
his
thoughts
running
on
the
conversation
which
had
just
taken
place
inside
never
comes
he
repeated
and
hurried
towards
the
sea
mary
ryan
lit
the
paraffin
lamp
which
hung
from
the
great
beam
that
stretched
across
the
middle
of
the
house
the
rushlight
was
now
used
no
longer
the
oil
lamp
had
taken
its
place
in
most
of
the
houses
in
frosses
norah
finished
her
meal
and
turned
to
her
books
for
a
long
while
there
was
silence
in
the
cabin
but
outside
the
wind
was
rising
whirling
round
the
corners
and
sweeping
in
under
the
door
tell
me
a
story
mother
norah
said
putting
her
books
aside
and
curling
up
like
a
pretty
ball
on
the
earthen
floor
in
front
of
the
fire
all
right
i
will
tell
you
a
story
silly
baby
that
you
are
said
the
old
woman
sitting
down
on
the
hassock
by
the
hearth
will
it
be
about
the
wee
man
with
the
flock
of
goats
before
him
and
the
flock
of
goats
behind
him
and
the
salmon
tied
to
the
laces
of
his
brogues
for
supper
not
that
one
a
maghair
i
know
it
will
it
be
about

ashy
pet

and
i
ll
be
combing
here
and
who
went
up
the
bay
of
baltic
carrying
the
rock
of
cattegat
on
her
shoulders
i
know
that
one
and
the
bonnie
bull
of
norway
you
know
as
well
then
it
will
be
about
the
cat
that

not
dress
its
whiskers
if
it
wasn
t
in
front
of
the
biggest
in
all
the
world
the
biggest
in
all
the
wide
world

the
broad
ocean
in
a
not
that
one
you
are
hard
to
please
this
very
night
i
will
tell
you
the
story
of
the
little
boy
who
wandered
on
the
rainy
roads
there
s
the
wind
rising
mercy
of
god
be
on
your
father
if
the
sea
is
out
of
order
mary
ryan
began
the
story
which
she
knew
by
heart
having
heard
it
so
often
from
the
lips
of
her
own
mother
here
it
may
be
remarked
most
of
the
folk
stories
of
donegal
are
of
norwegian
or
danish
origin
and
have
in
many
cases
been
so
well
preserved
that
the
scandinavian
names
of
people
and
places
are
retained
in
the
stories
until
the
present
day
once
upon
a
time
when
cows
were
kine
and
when
eagles
of
the
air
built
their
nests
in
the
beards
of
giants
a
little
boy
with
a
stick
in
his
hand
and
a
bundle
of
bannocks
over
his
shoulder
went
out
on
the
rainy
roads
to
push
his
fortune
iii
i
m
going
to
marry
a
prince
when
i
get
very
old
mother
said
norah
interrupting
the
prince
charming
for
that
s
what
the
girl
did
in
the
fairy
stories
when
she
grew
up
and
got
old
at
twenty
or
she
was
very
poor
at
first
and
did
nothing
grand
but
stopped
at
home
sweeping
the
floor
and
washing
dishes
then
one
night
an
old
woman
came
down
the
chimney
and
told
the
girl
to
go
to
a
dance
and
the
girl
didn
t
leave
the
dance
in
time
and
she
lost
one
of
her
slippers
and
oh
it
was
a
great
story
mother
i
read
it
in
a
book
that
fergus
you
were
reading
those
books
too
just
only
that
one
mother
and
fergus
didn
t
like
it
at
all
he
said
it
was
very
silly
so
it
was
alannah
when
it
put
thoughts
like
that
into
your
head
marry
prince
charming
and
you
going
to
be
a
holy
nun
nuns
never
marry
like
don
t
they
well
i
ll
not
marry
a
prince
charming
i
ll
marry
one
of
the
white
horsemen
who
are
under
the
mountain
of
but
nuns
never
marry
they
don
t
exclaimed
norah
in
a
puzzled
voice
then
with
childish
irrelevance
but
tell
me
the
story
about
the
white
horsemen
of
aileach
mother
that
s
the
best
story
of
long
long
ago
when
the
strangers
came
to
ireland
they
put
nearly
everybody
to
the
sword
the
old
and
young
the
fit
and
feeble
and
mind
you
ireland
was
in
worse
than
a
bad
way
the
mother
began
drifting
easily
into
her
narrative
ireland
was
a
great
place
in
those
days
with
castles
and
kings
kings
norah
there
were
five
of
them
now
there
isn
t
even
one
in
the
four
corners
of
the
country
but
the
strangers
came
like
a
storm
from
the
sea
and
there
was
no
standing
before
them
red
were
their
swords
red
as
their
hair
but
not
with
rust
but
with
the
blood
of
men
women
and
children
and
the
chieftains
of
ireland
and
the
men
of
ireland
could
make
no
stand
against
the
enemy
atall
what
am
i
to
do
cried
the
ardrigh
the
top
king
of
the
whole
country
speaking
from
the
door
of
his
own
castle
there
will
soon
be
no
ireland
belonging
to
me
it
will
all
go
to
the
then
up
spoke
an
old
withered
stick
of
a
man
that
nobody
knew
and
who
had
been
listening
to
the
words
of
the
king
have
you
asked
the
chieftain
of
the
white
horsemen
for
help
i
never
met
him
decent
stranger
answered
the
king
i
know
him
go
to
the
sea
when
it
strikes
in
storm
on
the
coast
of
tir
conail
said
the
old
man
to
the
king
and
call
out
to
maanan
maclir
for
aid
and
he
ll
send
to
your
help
his
ten
score
and
ten
white
horsemen
you
ll
see
the
white
horses
far
out
rearing
on
the
top
of
the
waves
every
steed
pawing
the
ocean
and
all
mad
for
the
fight
before
well
to
cut
a
long
story
short
the
king
did
as
he
was
told
and
called
to
the
white
horsemen
to
come
and
help
him
and
they
came
ten
score
of
them
and
ten
with
their
shields
shining
like
polished
silver
and
lances
bright
as
frosty
stars
down
from
the
north
they
rode
driving
the
foe
on
in
front
of
them
and
never
was
seen
such
a
rout
neither
in
the
days
that
went
before
nor
the
days
that
came
after
the
white
horsemen
cut
their
way
right
through
mountains
in
their
haste
to
get
to
the
other
side
for
nothing
could
stand
against
their
lances
nobody
could
go
as
quickly
as
them
not
even
the
strangers
who
were
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
out
of
their
way
and
when
victory
was
theirs
the
white
horsemen
came
back
here
to
tir
conail
again
and
stood
on
the
verge
of
the
ocean
while
maanan
maclir
headed
his
horse
out
on
the
waves
but
lo
and
behold
the
steed
could
no
longer
gallop
across
the
water
the
poor
animal
sank
into
the
sea
and
the
chieftain
was
nearly
drowned
at
that
moment
a
voice
nobody
knew
where
it
came
from
called
to
maanan
maclir
long
enough
has
the
sea
called
for
the
rest
and
quiet
that
was
not
given
to
it
by
the
white
horses
of
maclir
never
more
will
the
sea
bend
under
them
now
it
will
break
apart
and
let
them
through
when
they
heard
these
words
the
white
horsemen
turned
away
from
the
sea
and
went
galloping
to
the
foot
of
the
mountain
of
aileach
when
they
arrived
there
the
mountain
raised
itself
upon
one
side
just
like
the
lid
of
a
kettle
and
maanan
maclir
and
his
white
horsemen
disappeared
under
it
since
that
day
they
have
never
been
seen
but
the
mountain
didn
t
close
on
top
of
them
did
it
asked
norah
of
course
it
did
isn
t
it
closed
to
this
very
day
and
will
it
be
a
true
story
true
child
exclaimed
the
mother
sure
the
mountain
is
there
to
this
very
hour
and
besides
saint
columbkille
talks
about
it
in
his
then
the
white
horsemen
will
come
out
again
they
ll
come
out
when
the
great
war
comes
said
the
mother
and
that
will
be
when
there
are
roads
round
every
mountain
like
the
frills
round
the
cap
of
an
old
woman
it
will
start
the
great
war
when
the
nights
lengthen
and
the
year
grows
brown
between
the
seasons
of
scythe
and
sickle
murder
and
slaughter
madder
than
cattle
in
the
heat
of
summer
will
run
through
the
land
and
the
young
men
will
be
killed
and
the
men
and
the
old
the
very
crutches
of
the
cripples
will
be
taken
out
to
arm
the
fighters
and
the
will
be
turned
three
times
three
in
their
beds
to
see
if
they
are
fit
to
go
into
the
field
of
battle
death
will
take
them
all
for
that
is
how
it
is
to
be
that
way
and
no
other
and
when
they
re
all
gone
it
will
be
the
turn
of
the
white
horsemen
who
have
been
waiting
for
the
great
war
ever
since
they
chased
the
strangers
from
the
country
they
ll
come
out
from
under
aileach
when
the
day
arrives
ten
score
and
ten
of
them
with
silver
shields
and
spears
bright
as
stars
on
a
frosty
night
they
ll
fight
the
foe
and
win
and
victory
will
come
to
ireland
these
are
the
words
of
the
great
saint
are
the
white
horsemen
very
tall
mother
asked
norah
her
eyes
alight
with
enthusiastic
interest
tall
is
not
the
word
high
as
a
hill
higher
as
sliab
a
tuagh
it
s
as
nothing
compared
to
one
of
the
men
of
maanan
then
i
ll
marry
one
of
the
white
horsemen
said
norah
decision
in
her
clear
voice
i
ll
live
in
a
castle
polish
his
lance
and
shield
and
who
will
that
be
at
the
door
iv
norah
paused
someone
was
moving
outside
as
if
fumbling
for
the
latch
then
a
tall
man
pushed
the
door
of
the
cabin
inwards
and
entered
bringing
with
him
a
terrific
gust
of
wind
that
almost
shook
the
house
to
its
foundations
on
his
face
was
a
scared
look
and
his
clothes
were
dripping
wet
although
it
was
not
raining
was
it
himself
cried
the
old
woman
alluding
to
her
husband
and
speaking
to
the
man
who
entered
it
was
evident
from
the
tone
in
which
she
spoke
that
she
anticipated
something
terrible
it
was
himself
said
the
man
in
a
low
hoarse
voice
he
s
coming
on
the
flat
of
two
oars
god
bless
us
but
it
is
a
black
heart
that
the
sea
with
these
words
the
visitor
went
out
again
and
the
excited
voices
of
men
could
be
heard
floating
on
the
wind
it
s
your
father
norah
said
the
old
woman
he
went
down
with
the
curragh
i
m
thinking
down
through
the
black
water
mother
of
god
but
it
s
the
sea
that
has
the
black
heart
there
they
are
coming
with
him
open
the
door
wider
norah
the
girl
who
had
risen
from
her
seat
pulled
the
door
inwards
and
placed
a
stone
against
the
sill
to
keep
it
open
she
felt
as
if
a
thousand
pins
were
pricking
her
legs
her
head
was
heavy
her
fingers
felt
enormous
and
when
they
pressed
against
the
door
it
seemed
to
norah
as
if
they
did
not
belong
to
her
at
all
outside
it
was
very
dark
the
heavens
held
no
stars
and
it
looked
as
if
the
howling
gale
had
whirled
them
away
in
the
darkness
a
torch
swayed
in
the
wind
and
behind
the
torch
black
forms
of
men
and
white
pallid
faces
could
be
discerned
norah
s
mind
turned
to
the
stories
which
her
mother
had
been
telling
her
she
knew
it
was
wrong
to
think
of
them
at
that
moment
but
she
felt
an
inordinate
desire
to
laugh
at
something
what
she
wanted
to
laugh
at
she
did
not
know
why
she
wanted
to
laugh
she
could
not
fathom
are
they
coming
norah
asked
the
old
woman
rising
from
her
seat
and
hobbling
with
difficulty
towards
the
door
mother
of
christ
but
the
hand
of
god
is
heavy
on
me
this
night
of
nights
children
of
my
own
and
man
of
my
own
all
all
going
away
from
me
i
ll
see
the
last
of
them
go
down
into
the
grave
before
me
for
with
my
hard
cough
and
the
long
sickness
i
ll
outlive
them
all
that
is
the
will
of
god
ten
sons
and
daughters
of
my
body
every
one
of
them
gone
and
one
away
in
black
foreign
parts
are
they
coming
norah
the
woman
reached
the
door
and
leant
against
the
jamb
for
support
the
torch
was
flaring
outside
and
very
near
watch
that
you
don
t
set
the
thatch
on
fire
a
voice
cried
two
men
entered
the
house
the
water
streaming
from
their
clothes
and
each
holding
a
burdened
oar
in
his
hands
across
the
oars
a
sail
was
bound
tightly
and
cold
in
death
on
the
sail
lay
james
ryan
his
grey
beard
sticking
out
stiffly
his
eyes
open
his
head
shaking
from
side
to
side
his
bare
feet
blue
with
the
cold
the
oars
which
brushed
sharply
against
the
old
woman
in
passing
were
laid
on
the
floor
and
the
dead
man
was
placed
on
the
bed
i
m
sweatin
like
a
pig
said
one
of
the
bearers
and
he
rubbed
his
wrinkled
brow
violently
with
the
back
of
his
hand
watch
the
thatch
someone
outside
shouted
the
torch
was
extinguished
and
a
crowd
of
men
entered
the
cabin
an
old
fisherman
lifted
the
oars
the
sail
was
rolled
into
a
bundle
and
carried
out
again
pools
of
water
formed
on
the
floor
and
tracks
of
wet
feet
showed
all
over
it
the
old
woman
hobbled
back
to
her
bed
and
gazed
long
and
earnestly
at
her
husband
some
of
the
men
took
off
their
hats
one
was
smoking
another
dressed
a
bleeding
foot
and
told
how
he
hit
it
against
a
sharp
rock
when
carrying
the
dead
man
up
from
the
sea
several
of
the
neighbouring
women
were
already
in
the
house
maire
a
crick
was
on
her
knees
by
the
bedside
i
am
used
to
it
now
said
the
old
woman
as
she
sorted
the
blankets
on
the
bed
with
her
withered
hands
ten
sons
and
daughters
and
another
away
and
maybe
never
hearing
from
him
again
himself
said
when
he
was
going
out
that
the
morrow
never
she
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
ran
her
fingers
over
the
wet
clothes
of
her
husband
opened
his
vest
put
her
hand
on
his
heart
shook
her
head
sadly
and
buttoned
the
coat
again
just
when
he
was
putting
out
the
wind
caught
him
and
he
dropped
like
a
stone
over
the
side
of
the
curragh
the
fisherman
was
saying
but
the
boat
was
no
good
anyway
it
is
one
of
the
congested
districts
board
s
boats
that
he
should
where
would
he
get
the
money
to
buy
one
asked
maire
a
crick
turning
round
from
the
prayer
which
she
was
saying
for
the
dead
man
the
money
can
be
paid
in
instalments
answered
the
red
fisherman
he
spoke
the
gaelic
as
nearly
everybody
in
frosses
did
but
the
words
instalments
and
congested
districts
board
were
said
in
english
ten
pounds
the
new
boats
cost
and
there
is
five
years
allowed
for
paying
the
the
congested
districts
board
is
going
to
be
a
great
help
someone
remarked
is
the
curragh
safe
asked
mary
ryan
turning
round
she
was
still
sitting
beside
the
bed
turning
over
the
clothes
with
lean
shaky
fingers
it
is
at
the
bottom
said
a
neighbour
eamon
doherty
by
name
it
was
rotten
anyhow
and
it
hadn
t
been
in
wet
water
for
close
on
two
years
now
i
wonder
what
made
shemus
go
out
on
it
nothing
atall
atall
left
said
the
old
woman
in
a
feeble
voice
if
i
only
had
the
curragh
even
and
himself
dead
after
all
the
times
that
the
sea
has
bent
under
him
never
to
see
him
again
never
isn
t
it
hard
to
think
that
a
thing
like
that
could
be
whereupon
saying
this
she
began
to
cry
at
first
quietly
but
afterwards
as
if
getting
warmed
to
the
task
more
loudly
until
her
sobs
could
be
heard
a
hundred
yards
away
from
the
house
if
i
only
had
the
curragh
left
she
repeated
time
and
again
norah
approached
the
bed
timidly
she
had
been
weeping
silently
by
the
door
ever
since
the
corpse
had
been
carried
in
death
was
here
in
the
house
it
had
already
taken
possession
of
her
father
and
it
was
with
her
also
not
nor
but
at
the
end
of
forty
years
or
of
fifty
and
was
it
not
all
the
same
and
what
was
this
death
she
did
not
know
she
only
thought
it
cruel
and
strange
her
own
helplessness
in
face
of
such
a
crisis
almost
overpowered
her
for
death
there
was
no
help
from
it
there
was
no
escape
it
was
all
powerful
and
terrible
and
might
come
and
go
but
her
father
would
lie
still
and
unheeding
he
would
not
return
he
could
not
return
this
fact
hammered
at
her
mind
and
the
cruelty
of
her
own
thoughts
tortured
her
she
tried
to
think
of
something
apart
from
the
tragedy
but
ever
her
mind
reverted
to
the
one
and
same
dreadful
subject
of
a
great
fact
she
was
certain
one
that
would
never
be
contradicted
her
father
was
dead
thousands
of
years
might
pass
and
one
truth
would
still
remain
unquestioned
her
father
was
dead
to
think
of
it
she
said
in
a
low
voice
dead
for
ever
she
went
down
on
her
knees
by
the
bedside
but
could
not
pray
god
was
cruel
he
had
no
mercy
she
sobbed
no
longer
but
with
wide
tearless
eyes
she
gazed
at
the
face
of
her
father
it
had
now
become
yellow
the
lips
blue
the
nose
was
pinched
and
the
eyes
sunken
the
water
from
his
clothes
was
dripping
underneath
the
bed
and
she
could
hear
the
of
it
falling
on
the
floor
everything
in
the
house
had
suddenly
taken
on
a
different
aspect
the
bed
appeared
strange
to
her
so
did
the
fire
the
low
droning
voices
of
the
neighbours
and
the
play
of
light
and
shadow
on
the
walls
the
old
cat
sitting
on
top
of
the
dresser
gazing
down
at
her
had
a
curious
look
in
its
eyes
the
animal
seemed
to
have
changed
in
some
queer
way
outside
the
wind
was
beating
against
the
house
and
wailing
over
the
chimney
never
in
her
life
before
had
she
heard
such
a
melancholy
sob
in
the
wind
chapter
ix
the
wake
i
several
more
neighbours
men
women
and
children
were
now
coming
in
with
eyes
fixed
straight
ahead
they
approached
the
corpse
went
down
on
their
knees
on
the
wet
floor
by
the
bedside
and
said
their
prayers
crossing
themselves
many
times
those
who
carried
the
dead
body
up
from
the
sea
drew
near
to
the
fire
and
dried
their
sodden
garments
in
the
midst
of
a
cloud
of
vapour
that
almost
hid
them
from
view
eamon
doherty
remarked
that
ireland
would
have
home
rule
presently
and
a
loud
discussion
mingled
with
many
jokes
was
soon
in
progress
the
irish
will
never
agree
said
old
oiney
dinchy
a
ancient
who
had
just
risen
from
his
knees
by
the
bedside
that
is
the
worst
of
the
irish
they
never
agree
look
at
them
now
in
the
house
of
commons
one
member
is
always
fighting
against
another
member
and
it
was
ever
the
same
for
contrairiness
is
in
their
blood
to
the
very
last
drop
of
there
is
always
bound
to
be
two
parties
said
master
diver
with
dogmatic
assurance
in
england
and
america
there
are
always
two
parties
sometimes
they
ll
never
get
on
then
said
eamon
doherty
there
are
no
two
parties
in
the
holy
church
and
that
s
why
it
gets
on
so
the
door
opened
and
sheila
carrol
the
beansho
entered
her
child
now
a
chubby
little
boy
of
three
toddling
at
her
heels
without
looking
round
she
went
down
on
her
knees
by
the
bedside
and
a
couple
of
women
who
were
praying
crossed
themselves
and
rose
hurriedly
a
few
of
the
younger
men
winked
knowingly
and
turned
their
thumbs
towards
the
old
mary
ryan
muttered
something
under
her
breath
and
turned
a
look
of
severe
disapproval
on
the
kneeling
woman
then
on
the
little
boy
who
had
run
forward
to
the
fire
where
he
was
holding
out
his
hands
to
the
blaze
who
ll
be
the
ones
that
will
go
to
greenanore
and
get
tea
bread
snuff
and
tobacco
for
the
wake
asked
mary
ryan
i

if
eamon
doherty
comes
along
with
me
said
old
oiney
dinchy
getting
to
his
feet
and
putting
a
live
peat
to
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
the
two
of
you

get
drunk
if

to
greenanore
together
said
the
old
woman
i
d
as
soon

the
she
pointed
with
her
thumb
over
her
shoulder
at
the
beansho
but
did
not
mention
her
name
to
greenanore
as
send
you
it
is
not
everyone
that
would
be
treated
that
way
if
they
offered
to
help
a
person
eamon
doherty
remarked
in
a
loud
voice
to
oiney
dinchy
i
ll
go
if
willie
the
duck
comes
with
me
said
a
long
lank
shaggy
youth
rising
from
one
corner
of
the
room
and
stretching
his
arms
you
re
the
man
for
the
job
micky
s
jim
answered
mary
ryan
coming
from
the
bedside
and
tottering
through
the
press
of
neighbours
to
the
dresser
where
the
delft
stood
she
raised
the
lid
dipped
her
hand
into
the
and
drew
out
a
fistful
of
money
four
shillings
for
tea
she
began
to
calculate
for
sugar
five
shillings
for
loaves
of
bread
four
shillings
and
sixpence
for
tobacco
and
sixpence
for
snuff
and
how
much

your
father

wake
eamon
doherty
four
gallons

no
less
eamon
answered
in
a
surly
tone
of
voice
two
gallons
of
potheen
micky
s
jim
and
get

as
cheap
as
you

said
the
old
woman
turning
to
the
youth
from
what
i
hear
martin
eveleen
sells
good
potheen
get
it
from
him
for
it
was
martin

norah
when
she
took
the
fargortha
on
the
road
to
greenanore
three
winters
the
money
was
handed
to
micky
s
jim
and
he
left
the
house
followed
by
willie
the
duck
a
small
man
dark
and
swarthy
with
a
hump
on
his
left
shoulder
and
a
voice
when
he
spoke
that
reminded
one
of
the
quacking
of
ducks
shillings
in
all
mumbled
mary
ryan
as
she
took
her
way
back
to
the
fireside
it
costs
a
lot
to
bury
a
body
and
there
will
never
be
left
one
at
all
to
bury
me
never
a
one
at
all
if
only
the
curragh
was
left
me
it
would
be
meanwhile
norah
had
slipped
out
and
went
from
house
to
house
borrowing
candlesticks
meenalicknalore

candlesticks
amongst

baskets
of
peat
holy
water
a
lamp
extra
chairs
stools
and
many
other
things
required
for
the

ii
at
midnight
the
cabin
was
cleared
of
everybody
but
the
washers
of
the
dead
eamon
doherty
and
master
diver
oiney
dinchy
was
very
angry
because
mary
ryan
did
not
ask
him
to
give
a
hand
at
the
washing
of
her
husband
it
wasn
t
as
if
shemus
and
me
weren
t
good
friends
said
oiney
and
besides
i
have
washed
more
dead
men
in
a
year
of
my
life
than
all
washed
by
eamon
and
master
diver
put
together
and
to
think
that
i
wasn
t
allowed
to
help
at
the
washin
the
men
and
women
who
had
left
the
cabin
went
down
on
their
knees
at
the
doorstep
and
recited
the
rosary
the
night
being
very
dark
the
young
men
drew
near
the
girls
and
tickled
them
on
the
bare
feet
while
they
prayed
when
admittance
was
again
possible
the
dead
man
lay
in
the
bed
his
body
covered
with
a
white
sheet
and
a
large
black
crucifix
resting
on
his
breast
his
clothes
were
already
burned
in
the
fire
it
being
a
common
custom
in
frosses
to
consign
the
clothes
of
the
dead
to
the
flames
on
the
first
night
of
the
wake
about
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
provisions
came
from
greenanore
the
house
was
now
crowded
and
several
games
such
as
the
priest
of
the
parish
catch
the
ten
and
put
your
fingers
in
the
crow
s
nest
were
in
progress
an
old
man
who
sat
in
the
corner
was
telling
a
story
of
the
famine
and
a
few
mischievous
boys
were
amusing
themselves
by
throwing
pieces
of
peat
at
his
hat
while
tea
was
being
made
the
rosary
was
again
started
micky
s
jim
a
trifle
the
worse
for
liquor
went
down
on
his
knees
on
a
chair
and
gave
out
the
prayers
the
mischievous
boys
turned
their
attentions
from
the
old
man
to
jim
who
was
presently
bombarded
by
a
fire
of
turf
one
went
past
his
ears
one
hit
him
on
the
back
another
on
the
head
a
third
on
the
brow
jim
got
angry
pray
away
yourselves
and
be
damned
to
you
he
roared
at
the
kneeling
house
and
jumping
off
the
chair
he
sat
down
in
a
corner
from
which
he
had
a
view
of
the
whole
party
prayers
came
to
an
abrupt
conclusion
the
chair
was
taken
by
the
beansho
who
placed
her
child
between
its
legs
and
the
little
boy
who
had
shown
a
wonderful
propensity
for
running
to
the
bedside
and
pulling
the
corpse
by
the
beard
was
held
a
fast
prisoner
four
or
five
women
moved
about
hurriedly
preparing
tea
whisky
was
served
without
skimp
or
stint
but
pipes
were
found
to
be
scarce
one
had
to
do
for
three
persons
each
pulling
at
it
in
turn
the
old
man
in
the
corner
took
up
the
famine
story
at
a
point
where
the
prayers
had
interrupted
the
recital
it
told
of
a
corpse
that
rose
from
the
bed
of
death
sat
down
at
the
table
lifted
a
bowl
of
tea
drank
it
and
went
back
to
bed
again
and
the
man
was
dead
all
the
time
said
the
willie
the
duck
speaking
in
a
quavering
voice
began
to
ask
riddles
what
bears
but
never
blossoms
he
enquired
the
hangman
s
rope
was
the
answer
what
tree
never
comes
to
fruit
he
asked
the
was
the
answer
this
is
the
best
guess
of
the
night
said
willie
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
sneezing
violently
no
one
will
be
able
to
answer
it
in
the
morning
four
legs
at
noon
two
legs
in
the
evening
three
legs
and
at
night
four
legs
and
what
would
that
be
it
s
a
man
said
eamon
doherty
looking
round
with
a
triumphant
glance
in
his
young
days
a
man
walks
on
his
hands
and
knees
when
he
grows
up
he
walks
on
two
legs
when
he
gets
older
he
walks
on
three
legs
two
and
a
stick
and
if
he
lives
long
enough
he
ll
walk
on
crutches
god
be
good
to
us
and
that
s
four
legs
you
re
a
man
with
a
head
eamon
said
willie
the
duck
and
how
did
you
guess
it
atall
i
heard
the
same
guess
often
and
i
knew
the
answer
every
time
eamon
replied
and
a
smile
of
satisfaction
lit
up
his
face
about
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
most
of
the
men
and
a
few
of
the
ancient
females
were
drunk
mary
ryan
had
fallen
asleep
by
the
fire
her
head
touching
the
white
ashes
of
her
husband
s
clothes
norah
placed
a
pillow
under
her
mother
s
head
and
took
up
a
seat
near
her
gazing
in
turn
at
the
silent
figure
which
lay
in
the
bed
and
the
blue
flames
chasing
one
another
up
the
black
chimney
two
lamps
one
at
each
end
of
the
house
spluttered
dismally
the
wind
outside
battered
loudly
against
the
door
and
wailed
over
the
chimney
oiney
dinchy
was
asleep
and
snoring
loudly
and
two
youngsters
blackened
his
face
with
soot
the
beansho
slept
and
her
child
long
since
released
from
the
prison
of
the
chair
was
blubbering
fitfully
on
the
damp
earth
of
the
a
young
woman
slumbered
the
naked
calves
of
her
finely
formed
legs
showing
micky
s
jim
slapped
the
legs
with
his
hand
the
girl
awoke
put
down
her
dress
until
it
covered
her
toes
made
a
face
at
the
tormentor
and
went
to
sleep
again
beside
norah
old
master
diver
now
remarkably
rotund
was
asleep
his
bald
head
hanging
to
one
side
and
a
spittle
slobbering
from
his
lips
norah
looked
round
at
the
sleepers
saw
the
stiff
legs
stretched
on
the
floor
the
long
awkward
arms
hanging
loosely
over
the
backs
of
the
chairs
the
bowls
and
the
upturned
whisky
glasses
on
the
table
heard
the
loud
snoring
the
rustle
of
petticoats
as
a
woman
changed
her
position
on
a
stool
the
crackle
of
falling
peat
on
the
hearth
the
whimpering
of
the
beansho
s
child
and
the
sound
made
by
the
lips
of
a
sucking
babe
pulling
at
its
mother
s
breast
the
strange
fear
that
which
had
taken
possession
of
her
three
years
before
on
the
rocks
of
dooey
seized
her
again
to
her
all
things
seemed
to
lack
finish
as
they
lacked
design
a
vague
sense
of
repulsion
overcame
the
girl
as
she
gazed
at
the
sleepers
huddled
on
form
and
floor
she
shuddered
as
if
in
a
fever
and
approached
the
bed
there
the
awful
stillness
of
the
dead
fascinated
her
she
was
looking
at
the
dead
but
somehow
death
had
now
lost
its
terror
it
was
the
living
who
caused
her
fear
she
knelt
down
and
prayed
chapter
x
coffin
and
coin
i
for
two
days
and
nights
the
neighbours
came
in
prayed
by
the
bedside
drank
bowls
of
tea
smoked
long
white
clay
pipes
and
departed
only
to
return
later
and
renew
the
same
performance
a
coffin
and
the
latter
shaped
like
a
ladder
the
sides
of
which
were
cushioned
to
ease
the
shoulders
of
the
men
who
carried
it
were
procured
on
the
rungs
of
the
a
number
of
notches
three
hundred
and
in
all
told
of
the
bodies
carried
on
it
to
the
grave
the
bearer
had
been
in
service
for
many
years
and
had
been
used
by
most
of
the
families
in
frosses
the
man
who
made
it
was
long
dead
number
represented
his
notch
on
the
rungs
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
oiney
dinchy
and
micky
s
jim
lifted
the
dead
man
from
the
bed
and
placed
him
in
the
coffin
before
the
lid
was
screwed
down
mary
ryan
knelt
over
the
coffin
gripping
the
side
near
her
with
thin
long
fingers
which
showed
white
at
the
joints
and
kissing
her
husband
she
burst
into
a
loud
outcry
of
grief
norah
more
reserved
in
her
sorrow
knelt
on
the
floor
said
a
short
prayer
and
then
kissed
the
face
of
the
corpse
as
her
mother
had
done
the
lid
was
fastened
but
here
an
interruption
occurred
the
wife
wanted
to
look
at
her
husband
for
just
one
other
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
old
oiney
dinchy
who
was
discussing
the
best
means
of
catching
flukes
and
tying
the
coffin
lifted
the
lid
again
and
stood
silently
by
his
hat
drawn
down
well
over
his
eyes
mary
ryan
gave
vent
to
another
outburst
of
grief
the
coffin
was
again
closed
and
lifted
on
the
wooden
bearer
an
idle
child
was
busily
engaged
in
counting
the
notches
that
s
for
the
man
who
made
it
someone
was
saying
listen
micky
s
jim
whispered
mary
ryan
as
the
youth
passed
her
going
towards
the
door
with
a
basket
of
pipes
and
tobacco
well
mary
what
is
it
jim
asked
was
this
a
good
year
beyond
the
water
jim
went
yearly
to
the
in
scotland
taking
with
him
a
squad
of
men
and
women
from
his
own
country
and
over
these
he
was
master
while
they
were
at
work
it
was
not
so
very
bad
said
jim
cautiously
he
was
afraid
that
the
old
woman
might
ask
the
loan
of
money
from
him
next
year
i
have
a
mind
to
send
and
not
to
make
a
nun
of
her
after
all
norah
was
piling
peat
on
the
fire
lifting
them
from
the
floor
and
dropping
them
into
the
flames
as
she
bent
down
jim
noticed
every
movement
of
her
body
and
paid
very
little
attention
to
the
words
of
the
old
woman
norah
having
finished
her
task
stood
upright
jim
waited
eagerly
for
a
repetition
of
her
former
movement
but
seeing
that
she
was
weeping
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
task
of
getting
the
coffin
through
the
doorway
norah
would
be
a
light
girl
for
heavy
work
on
the
scottish
farms
jim
thought
as
he
stooped
down
and
lifted
a
rung
of
the
bearer
could
he
take
her
with
him
that
was
a
ticklish
question
she
was
clever
with
the
needles
he
knew
but
she
had
not
done
any
heavy
manual
work
for
the
last
two
years
learning
lessons
was
to
jim
an
idle
task
but
the
movement
of
her
body
and
especially
of
her
legs
when
bending
over
the
fire
appealed
to
jim
the
grace
of
her
carriage
the
poise
of
her
head
the
soft
hair
that
fell
over
her
shoulders
all
these
found
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
healthy
young
man
my
cripes
i
ll
take
her
with
me
next
year
he
said
under
his
breath
he
spoke
in
english
and
had
learned
many
strange
oaths
abroad
ii
outside
a
large
crowd
of
people
were
waiting
the
women
dressed
in
red
flannel
petticoats
and
woollen
shawls
the
men
in
white
wrappers
and
corduroy
trousers
the
coffin
bearer
was
raised
on
high
four
men
placed
their
shoulders
under
it
a
bottle
of
holy
water
was
sprinkled
over
bearers
and
burden
indiscriminately
the
men
and
women
crossed
themselves
many
times
and
the
mournful
procession
started
mary
ryan
stood
at
the
door
and
watched
it
wending
its
way
across
the
dreary
uneven
fields
past
the
three
rocks
now
getting
lost
in
some
hollow
again
rising
to
the
shoulders
of
a
hillock
the
coffin
swaying
unevenly
on
the
shoulders
of
the
bearers
the
red
petticoats
of
the
women
in
the
rear
shaking
in
the
breeze
the
widow
almost
too
weak
to
move
was
with
difficulty
restrained
from
going
to
the
churchyard
norah
having
arranged
the
hassock
in
the
corner
for
her
mother
had
followed
the
procession
and
now
the
old
woman
thought
that
she
could
detect
her
child
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
following
in
the
rear
of
the
party
micky
s
jim
who
had
not
gone
away
yet
was
engaged
in
sorting
a
rope
on
the
thatch
which
had
been
blown
askew
by
the
wind
of
the
previous
nights
i
ll
overtake
the
funeral
mary
he
said
when
he
completed
the
work
i
was
just
making
the
thatch
strong
against
the
breeze
and
i
have
tied
a
broken
mother
of
god
be
good
to
you
jim
but
it
is
yourself
that
has
the
kindly
heart
said
mary
in
a
tremulous
whisper
could
you
take
norah
with
you
beyond
the
water
next
year
jim
called
to
mind
the
movements
of
the
girl
s
body
when
she
stooped
to
lift
peat
for
the
fire
and
the
remembrance
filled
him
with
pleasure
when
next
summer
comes
round
i
ll
see
mary
ryan
he
answered
if
there
is
a
place
to
spare
in
the
squad
i
ll
let
you
know
and
your
norah
will
have
the
very
first
chance
of
mother
of
god
bless
you
jim
for
the
kindness
is
in
you
said
the
old
woman
it
is
me
that
is
the
lone
body
this
very
minute
with
never
a
penny
in
my
house
and
not
even
the
old
curragh
left
to
me
to
make
a
penny
well
i
m
off
mary
said
jim
the
coffin
is
going
out
of
sight
and
they
ll
be
needing
new
blood
under
he
hurried
across
the
fields
his
long
legs
covering
an
enormous
spread
of
earth
at
every
stride
over
the
brae
he
hurried
and
at
the
turn
of
the
road
halted
for
a
moment
and
looked
back
at
mary
ryan
s
cabin
the
woman
still
stood
at
the
door
one
hand
shading
her
eyes
looking
towards
the
frosses
churchyard
which
lay
more
than
three
miles
away
thinkin
that
she
could
get
anything
for
an
old
curragh
he
muttered
contemptuously
as
he
resumed
his
stride
she
s
an
old
fool
but
norah
ah
she
s
a
soncy
lass
and
she
was
good
to
look
at
when
making
that
fire
iii
the
graveyard
surrounded
by
a
stone
wall
broken
down
in
several
places
served
as
a
grazing
plot
for
bullocks
donkeys
and
sheep
as
well
as
for
the
burial
place
of
the
dead
a
long
walk
lined
with
stunted
hazel
bushes
ran
through
the
yard
and
at
the
end
a
low
stone
vault
hardly
higher
than
a
man
s
head
stood
under
the
shadow
of
an
overhanging
sycamore
the
funeral
procession
was
delayed
on
the
journey
and
father
devaney
and
stamped
up
and
down
while
waiting
its
arrival
he
had
come
all
the
way
from
greenanore
and
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
back
again
the
morning
was
cold
and
caused
him
to
shiver
a
little
and
when
he
shivered
he
clapped
his
hands
vigorously
the
palm
of
one
against
the
back
of
the
other
his
large
mansion
complete
now
and
habitable
had
not
been
fully
paid
for
yet
and
most
of
his
parishioners
were
a
pound
or
two
in
arrears
when
this
money
came
to
hand
matters
would
be
much
better
old
devaney
had
developed
a
particularly
fine
taste
in
wine
and
cigars
and
found
these
very
expensive
and
at
present
he
called
to
mind
how
james
ryan
was
two
pounds
in
arrears
with
the
mansion
tax
the
old
priest
knew
that
this
money
would
never
come
to
hand
the
widow
was
ill
no
word
had
been
heard
of
fergus
for
years
and
norah
ryan
was
a
light
slip
of
a
girl
who
would
probably
never
earn
a
penny
devaney
knew
all
the
affairs
of
his
flock
and
he
stamped
up
and
down
the
graveyard
a
little
angry
with
the
dead
man
who
being
so
long
in
coming
to
his
last
home
had
kept
him
waiting
for
thirty
minutes
the
funeral
came
in
sight
creeping
up
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
that
rose
near
at
hand
the
bearers
straining
under
their
burden
as
they
hurried
across
the
uneven
ground
with
the
coffin
rising
and
falling
on
their
shoulders
like
a
bark
in
a
storm
at
sea
the
gate
of
the
graveyard
was
already
open
the
procession
filed
through
father
devaney
stepping
out
in
front
his
surplice
streaming
in
the
wind
the
good
man
thought
of
the
warm
dinner
waiting
for
him
at
home
and
being
in
a
hurry
to
get
done
with
the
burial
service
he
walked
so
quickly
that
the
bearers
could
hardly
keep
up
with
him
on
the
floor
of
the
little
vault
in
the
centre
of
the
graveyard
the
coffin
was
set
down
and
the
basket
of
snuff
pipes
and
tobacco
was
handed
round
all
the
men
took
pipes
filled
them
with
rank
plug
and
lit
them
the
older
women
lit
pipes
also
and
everybody
with
the
exception
of
the
priest
and
norah
ryan
took
snuff
hurry
up
said
father
devaney
ye
can
smoke
after
ye
do
yer
duty
it
would
be
well
if
ye
were
puttin
yer
hands
in
yer
pockets
now
and
gettin
yer
offerin
s
immediately
a
stream
of
silver
descended
on
the
coffin
all
the
mourners
paid
rapidly
but
in
turn
and
the
priest
called
out
their
names
as
they
paid
a
sum
of
ten
pounds
seventeen
shillings
was
collected
and
this
the
priest
carefully
wrapped
up
in
a
woollen
muffler
and
put
into
his
pocket
now
hurry
up
boys
and
get
a
move
on
ye
and
open
the
grave
he
shouted
making
no
effort
to
hide
his
impatience
now
that
the
money
was
safely
in
his
keeping
he
felt
full
of
the
importance
of
a
man
who
knows
that
everybody
around
him
trembles
under
his
eyes
three
or
four
young
fellows
were
digging
the
grave
and
joking
loudly
as
they
worked
a
crowd
of
men
stood
round
them
puffing
white
clouds
of
smoke
up
into
the
air
many
of
the
women
were
kneeling
beside
graves
that
held
all
that
remained
of
one
or
another
near
and
dear
to
them
norah
ryan
stood
alone
with
the
priest
her
dark
shawl
drawn
over
her
white
forehead
and
a
few
stray
tresses
that
had
fallen
over
her
face
shaking
in
the
breeze
it
is
a
black
day
this
for
you
norah
a
black
day
said
the
priest
speaking
in
gaelic
two
tears
coursed
down
the
girl
s
cheeks
and
she
fixed
a
pair
of
sorrowful
grey
eyes
on
the
man
when
he
spoke
don
t
cry
girsha
beag
little
girl
said
the
priest
it
is
all
for
the
best
all
for
the
best
because
it
is
the
will
of
he
looked
sharply
at
the
girl
who
feeling
uncomfortable
in
his
presence
longed
to
be
away
from
the
man
s
side
she
wondered
why
she
had
not
gone
off
to
the
other
end
of
the
graveyard
with
sheila
carrol
whom
she
could
now
see
kneeling
before
a
black
wooden
cross
that
was
fast
falling
into
decay
but
it
would
be
wrong
to
go
away
from
the
side
of
her
father
s
coffin
she
thought
any
word
from
fergus
of
late
the
priest
was
asking
no
not
the
smallest
that
mary
ryan
owed
him
two
pounds
and
that
there
was
very
little
possibility
of
ever
receiving
the
money
forcibly
occurred
to
the
priest
at
that
moment
ye
ll
not
be
in
a
good
way
at
home
now
he
said
aloud
there
s
hardly
a
white
shilling
in
the
house
answered
the
girl
is
that
the
way
of
it
exclaimed
the
priest
then
seemed
on
the
point
of
giving
expression
to
something
more
forcible
but
with
an
effort
he
restrained
himself
well
it
can
not
be
helped
i
suppose
but
there
are
two
pounds
owing
for
the
building
of
my
new
iv
the
grave
is
ready
said
micky
s
jim
approaching
the
priest
and
saluting
the
youth
was
perspiring
profusely
his
shirt
open
at
the
neck
exposed
his
hairy
chest
on
which
beads
of
sweat
were
glistening
brightly
in
with
the
coffin
then
said
the
priest
taking
a
book
from
his
pocket
and
approaching
the
open
grave
a
pile
of
red
earth
out
of
which
several
white
bones
protruded
lay
on
the
brink
and
long
earthworms
crawled
across
it
the
coffin
was
lowered
into
the
grave
with
a
rope
norah
wept
loudly
old
oiney
dinchy
remarked
that
the
bones
belonged
to
her
grandparents
whom
she
did
not
remember
remember
man
that
thou
art
dust
and
unto
dust
thou
shalt
return
the
priest
chanted
in
a
loud
droning
voice
norah
kneeling
on
the
wet
ground
her
head
bent
down
over
her
bosom
so
that
her
hair
hung
over
her
shoulders
saw
nothing
but
the
black
coffin
which
was
speedily
disappearing
under
the
red
clay
and
heard
nothing
but
the
thud
of
the
earth
as
it
struck
the
coffin
the
priest
took
his
departure
the
grave
was
filled
up
and
the
crowd
began
to
disperse
come
away
home
now
said
sheila
carrol
to
norah
who
was
still
kneeling
on
the
wet
ground
the
girl
rose
without
a
word
brushed
her
dress
with
a
woollen
handkerchief
and
accompanied
the
beansho
from
the
churchyard
don
t
cry
norah
said
sheila
observing
that
tears
were
still
falling
down
the
cheeks
of
her
companion
everyone
must
die
and
go
away
just
the
same
as

had
never

worse

things
far
far
they
had
now
reached
a
stile
and
far
in
front
the
soft
caishin
path
wound
on
by
rock
and
rath
across
the
broad
expanse
of
moor
several
people
walking
one
after
another
were
in
front
the
soft
ooze
was
squirting
under
their
feet
and
splashing
against
their
ankles
in
the
midst
of
the
heather
a
young
bullock
lay
chewing
the
cud
and
looked
upon
the
with
that
stupid
involved
look
peculiar
to
the
ox

agitated
and
voluble
rose
into
the
air
and
chattered
as

across

brown
of
the
moor

chapter
xi
the
train
from
greenanore
i
when
one
is
leaving
home
every
familiar
object
seems
to
take
on
a
different
aspect
and
becomes
almost
strange
and
foreign
the
streets
houses
and
landscape
which
you
have
gazed
on
for
years
become
in
some
way
very
remote
like
objects
seen
in
a
dream
but
under
this
guise
every
familiar
landmark
becomes
dearer
than
ever
it
has
been
before
so
norah
ryan
felt
as
she
was
leaving
home
in
the
june
of
bound
for
the
potato
fields
of
scotland
is
this
the
road
to
greenanore
the
road
that
our
feet
took
when
goin
to
the
town
for
the
stockin
yarn
she
asked
herself
several
times
it
is
changed
somehow
it
doesn
t
seem
to
be
the
same
place
but
for
all
that
i
like
it
better
than
ever
why
this
is
i
do
not
know
i
seem
to
be
in
a
dream
of
some
her
thoughts
were
confused
and
her
mind
ran
on
several
things
at
the
same
time
her
mother
s
words
at
the
prayer
that
the
child
might
do
well
the
quick
words
of
tearless
farewell
spoken
at
the
doorstep
and
as
she
thought
of
these
things
she
wondered
why
her
mother
did
not
weep
when
her
only
child
was
leaving
her
the
girl
was
now
walking
alone
to
the
village
of
greenanore
there
she
would
meet
all
the
members
of
the
party
and
every
step
of
the
journey
brought
a
thousand
bygone
memories
vividly
to
her
mind
fergus
she
thought
of
his
at
the
the
dog
whining
in
ballybonar
the
lowing
cow
the
soft
song
of
the
sea
would
she
ever
see
fergus
again
where
had
he
been
all
these
years
looking
into
the
distance
she
could
see
the
mountains
that
hemmed
glenmornan
and
light
clouds
white
and
fleecy
as
candlemas
sheep
resting
on
the
tops
of
them
further
down
on
the
foothills
the
smoke
of
rose
into
the
air
telling
of
the
who
laboured
on
the
brown
bogs
at
the
stacks
and
rikkles
norah
thought
of
dermod
flynn
indeed
she
called
him
to
mind
daily
when
gazing
towards
the
hills
of
glenmornan
recollecting
with
a
certain
feeling
of
pride
the
boy
s
demeanour
at
school
and
his
utter
indifference
towards
personal
chastisement
the
dreamy
eyes
of
dermod
and
his
manner
of
looking
through
the
school
window
at
nothing
in
particular
fascinated
her
and
the
very
remembrance
of
the
youth
standing
beside
her
facing
the
map
of
the
world
always
caused
a
pleasant
thrill
to
run
through
her
body
now
as
she
looked
at
the
hills
of
glenmornan
the
incidents
of
the
morning
on
which
she
went
to
pull
there
came
back
to
her
mind
and
she
wondered
if
dermod
flynn
thought
the
hills
so
much
changed
on
the
day
when
he
was
setting
out
for
the
rabble
of
strabane
a
large
iron
bridge
lately
built
by
the
congested
districts
board
spanned
the
bay
between
frosses
and
dooey
norah
crossed
over
this
to
the
other
side
where
the
black
rocks
sharp
and
pointed
spread
over
the
white
sand
it
was
here
that
the
women
slept
out
on
the
night
many
years
ago
and
now
norah
had
only
a
very
dim
remembrance
of
the
event
up
to
the
rise
of
the
hill
she
hurried
and
from
the
townland
of
ballybonar
looked
back
at
frosses
at
the
little
strips
of
land
running
down
to
the
sea
at
the
white
cabins
dotted
all
over
the
parish
at
frosses
graveyard
and
the
lone
sycamore
tree
that
grew
there
showing
like
a
black
stain
against
the
sky
seeing
it
she
thought
of
her
father
and
said
an
our
father
and
hail
mary
for
the
repose
of
his
soul
then
her
eye
roved
over
frosses
again
maybe
after
this
i
ll
never
set
my
two
eyes
on
the
place
she
said
then
added
just
like
fergus
the
thought
that
she
might
never
see
the
place
again
filled
her
with
a
certain
feeling
of
importance
which
up
to
now
had
been
altogether
foreign
to
her
ii
at
the
station
she
met
the
other
members
of
the
potato
squad
fifteen
in
all
some
were
sitting
on
their
boxes
others
on
the
bundles
bound
in
cotton
handkerchiefs
which
contained
all
their
clothes
and
toilet
requisites
the
latter
consisted
of
combs
and
possessed
by
the
women
and
razors
the
property
of
the
men
micky
s
jim
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
platform
his
hands
deep
in
his
trousers
pockets
and
a
wooden
pipe
in
his
mouth
from
time
to
time
he
pulled
the
pipe
from
between
his
teeth
accompanying
the
action
with
a
knowing
shrug
of
his
shoulders
and
spat
into
the
way
is
this
yerself
norah
he
exclaimed
casting
a
patronising
glance
at
the
girl
as
she
entered
the
railway
station
ye
are
almost
late
for
the
train
did
ye
walk
the
whole
way
ah
here
she
comes
the
train
came
in
sight
puffing
round
the
curve
the
women
rose
from
their
seats
clutched
hastily
at
their
bundles
and
formed
into
a
row
on
the
verge
of
the
platform
the
men
most
of
whom
were
smoking
took
their
pipes
from
their
mouths
hit
the
bowls
sharply
against
their
palms
thus
emptying
them
of
white
ash
then
with
a
feigned
look
of
unconcern
on
their
faces
they
picked
up
their
belongings
with
a
leisure
which
implied
that
they
were
men
well
used
to
such
happenings
they
were
posing
a
little
knowing
that
those
who
came
to
see
them
off
would
tell
for
days
in
frosses
how
indifferently
mick
or
ned
took
the
train
leading
to
the
land
beyond
the
water
just
went
on
the
train
with
no
more
concern
on
their
faces
than
if
they
were
going
to
a
neighbour
s
wake
the
frosses
people
would
say
the
train
puffed
into
the
station
the
driver
descended
from
his
post
yawned
stretched
his
arms
and
surveyed
the
crowd
with
a
look
of
superior
disdain
the
fireman
with
an
in
his
hands
raced
along
the
footplate
and
disappeared
behind
the
engine
only
to
come
back
almost
immediately
puffing
and
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
face
with
a
piece
of
torn
and
dirty
rag
all
aboard
micky
s
jim
shouted
in
an
excited
voice
forgetting
pose
for
a
moment

or
the
train

be

presently
all
with
the
exception
of
the
speaker
were
in
their
compartments
and
looking
for
seats
micky
s
jim
remained
on
the
platform
waiting
for
the
train
to
start
when
he
could
show
by
boarding
it
as
it
steamed
out
of
the
station
that
he
had
learned
a
thing
or
two
beyond
the
water
in
his
time
a
thing
or
two
not
known
to
all
the
frosses
people
a
ticket
collector
examined
the
tickets
chatting
heartily
as
he
did
so
when
he
found
that
norah
had
not
procured
hers
he
ran
off
and
came
back
with
one
smiling
happily
as
if
glad
to
be
of
assistance
to
the
girl
a
lady
and
gentleman
tourists
no
doubt
paced
up
and
down
the
platform
eyeing
everybody
with
the
tourists
rude
look
of
enquiry
a
stray
dog
sniffed
at
micky
s
jim
s
trousers
and
got
kicked
for
its
curiosity
the
engine
driver
yawned
again
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
open
mouth
and
mounted
to
his
place
the
whistle
sounded
and
with
micky
s
jim
standing
on
the
the
train
steamed
out
of
the
station
norah
who
had
never
been
on
a
train
before
took
up
her
seat
near
the
window
and
rubbed
the
pane
with
her
shawl
in
order
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
country
which
seemed
to
be
flying
past
with
remarkable
speed
the
telegraph
wires
were
sinking
and
rising
the
poles
like
big
hands
gripped
them
up
dropped
them
but
only
to
lift
them
up
again
as
threads
are
lifted
on
the
fingers
of
a
knitter
there
were
eleven
people
in
the
compartment
four
women
and
seven
men
one
of
the
latter
eamon
doherty
was
eating
a
piece
of
dry
bread
made
from
indian
meal
the
rest
of
the
men
were
smoking
black
clay
pipes
so
short
of
shank
that
the
bowls
almost
touched
the
noses
of
the
smokers
but
jim
s
pipe
was
different
from
any
of
these
it
was
a
wooden
one
real
briar
root
he
said
and
was
awfully
proud
of
it
it
had
cost
three
shillings
and
sixpence
in
a
town
beyond
the
water
he
now
told
the
party
not
indeed
for
the
first
time
but
none
of
the
listeners
believed
him
two
of
the
women
said
their
prayers
one
wept
because
she
was
leaving
ireland
and
norah
ryan
spent
her
time
looking
out
of
the
window
iii
who
ll
take
a
drink
asked
micky
s
jim
pulling
a
of
whisky
from
his
pocket
and
drawing
out
the
cork
with
his
fingers

willie

was
sitting
beside

weeping
woman
his
one
leg
across
the
other
and
his
hands
clasped
over
his
stomach
i

he
now
tried
to
balance

the
point
of
his
finger
is

habit

willie
edging

from

bottle
successfully
within
an
inch
of
the
roof
ye

let

bottle

shouted
micky
s
jim
and
shook
the
bottle
with
perilous
carelessness
holding
out
the
free
hand
in
case
it
should
fall
it
wouldn
t
crack
a
wooden
head
that
s
brockagh
station
that
we

as
the

remarked
one
of
the
women
who

not
going
well
at
home
her
husband
lay
ill
with
paralysis
the
children
from
a
monetary
point
of
view
were
useless
as
yet
the
oldest
boy
thin
and
weakly
a
cripple
from
birth
went
about
on
crutches
the
younger
ones
were
eternally
crying
for
bread
maire
a
glan
placed
the
rosary
round
her
neck
and
took
a
piece
of
oaten
bread
from
the
bundle
at
her
feet
will

have
a
wee
bit
to
eat
norah
ryan
she
asked
my
thanks
to
ye
maire
a
glan
but
i
m
not
hungry
answered
norah
rubbing
the
window
where
her
breath
had
dimmed
it
i
thought
that
ye
might
be
seeing
that
yer
eye
is
not
wet
on
leavin
home
said
the
woman
breaking
bread
and
putting
a
bit
of
it
in
her
mouth
there
the
train
is
stopping
she
went
on
and
i
have
two
sisters

the
stretch
of
a
mile
from

aye
sure
said
willie
the
duck
with
his
usual
quack
i
know
both
and
once
i
had
a
notion
of
one
of
them
lookin
for
one
of
god
s
stars
to
light
yer
pipe
with
as
the
man
said
remarked
the
woman
contemptuously
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
poor
fellow
s
hump
ye

a
burden
enough
on
yer
shoulders
and
not
to
be
thinkin
at
all
of

them
that

the
burden
should

the
first
to
complain
of
it
said
willie
the
duck
edging
still
further
away
from
micky
s
jim
who
was
now
standing
up
and
balancing
the
whisky
bottle
on
the
point
of
his
nose
the
women
tittered
the
men
drew
their
pipes
from
their
mouths
and
gave
vent
to
loud
guffaws
the
train
started
out
from
brockagh
station
a
porter
ran
after
it
shut
a
door
and
again
norah
ryan
watched
the
fields
run
past
and
the
telegraph
wires
rise
and
fall
i
ll
bet
that
not
one
of
ye
knows
who

said
micky
s
jim
tiring
of
his
play
and
putting
the
bottle
back
in
his
pocket
after
having
taken
a
sup
of
its
contents
who
asked
several
voices

if

mind
right
he
was
sort
of
soft
in
the
a
faint
blush
rose
to
norah
ryan
s
cheek
and
though
she
still
looked
out
of
the
window
she
now
failed
to
see
the
objects
flying
past
the
conversation
had
suddenly
become
very
interesting
for
her

with
a
farmer

from

iv
the
train
sped
on
house
field
and
roadway
whirled
by
and
norah
almost
bewildered
ceased
to
wonder
where
this
road
ran
to
who
lived
in
that
house
what
was
the
name
of
this
village
and
whether
that
large
building
with
the
spire
on

of
it
was
a
church
bad
luck
to
it
or
chapel
god
bless
it
i
ll
see

she
thought
her
mind
reverting
to
dermod

as
curly
as
when
he
was
at
frosses
school
two
years
away
from
his
own
home
and
the
home
of
all
his
people
such
a
long
while
and
now
he
ll
know
everything
about
the
whole
mixed
with
these
words
was
the
remembrance
of
her
mother
all
alone
in
the
old
cabin
at
frosses
and
a
vague
feeling
of
regret
filled
her
mind
are
you
getting
homesick
norah
maire
a
glan
enquired
speaking
in
gaelic
which
came
more
easily
than
english
to
her
tongue
it
s
not
the
dry
eye
that
always
tells
of
the
lightest
heart
i
know
old

a
fine
daughter
eamon

weak
thin
voice
micky

a
notion
of

willie
the
duck
but
what
girl
hasn
t
jim
a
notion
of
jim
cleaned
out
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
with
a
rusty
nail
and
fell
asleep
while
engaged
on
the
task
the
conversation
went
on

wench

and
she
will
but
he
s
the
man
that
has
the
money
to
pay
for
norah
deep
in
a
dreamy
mood
listened
idly
to
snatches
of
song
the
laughter
and
the
voices
that
seemed
to
be
speaking
at
a
very
remote
distance
but
after
a
while
sinking
into
the
quiet
isolation
of
her
own
thoughts
the
outside
world
became
to
the
young
girl
she
was
thinking
of
dermod
why
he
persisted
in
coming
up
before
her
mind
s
eye
she
could
not
explain
but
the
dream
of
meeting
with
him
on
the
streets
of
derry
exerted
a
restful
influence
over
her
and
she
fell
into
a
light
slumber
it
s
the
soncy
girl
she
looks
with
the
sleep
on
almost
imperceptibly
norah
opened
her
eyes
the
transition
was
so
quiet
that
she
was
hardly
aware
that
she
had
slept
and
those
who
looked
on
were
hardly
aware
that
she
had
wakened
it
was
maire
a
glan
who
had
been
speaking
the
train
now
stood
at
a
station
and
micky
s
jim
was
walking
up
and
down
the
platform
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
his
hands
deep
in
his
trousers
pockets
facing
the
window
was
a
bookstall
and
a
girl
handing
to
some
man
a
newspaper
and
a
book
with
a
red
cover
norah
recollected
that
fergus
often
read
books
with
red
covers
just
like
the
one
that
was
handed
over
the
counter
of
the
bookstall
that
it
was
possible
to
have
a
shop
containing
nothing
but
books
and
papers
came
as
a
surprise
to
norah
ryan
over
the
bookstall
in
white
letters

the
old
woman
who
was
telling

and
taking
no
notice
of
anything
but
the
black
beads
passing
through
her

they
stepped
on
the
dry
and
dusty
derry
streets
the
whole
fifteen
of
them
with
their
bundles
over
their
shoulders
or
dangling
from
their
arms
norah
ryan
homesickness
heavy
on
her
heart
had
eyes
for
everything
and
everything
on
which
she
looked
was
so
strange
and
foreign
the
car
that
came
along
the
streets
moving
so
quickly
and
never
a
horse
drawing
it
the
shops
where
hair
was
taken
off
for
a
few
pence
and
put
on
again
for
a
few
shillings
shops
with
watches
and
gold
rings
in
the
windows
shops
where
they
sold
nothing
but
books
and
papers
and
the
high
clocks
facing
four
ways
at
once
and
looking
all
over
the
town
and
the
country
beyond
the
long
streets
without
end
almost
the
houses
without
number
the
large
mills
at
the
where
row
after
row
of
windows
rose
one
above
another
until
it
made
the
eye
dim
and
the
head
dizzy
to
look
up
at
them
the
noise
the
babble
of
voices
the
hurrying
of
men
the
women
their
dresses
filled
norah
with
a
weary
longing
for
her
own
fireside
so
far
away
by
the
shores
of
the
sea
that
washed
round
donegal
a
bell
tolled
micky
s
jim
turned
round
and
looked
at
norah
who
immediately
blessed
herself
and
commenced
to
say
the
angelus
that
s
not
the
bell
above
the
chapel
of
greenanore
that
s
the
town
clock
laughed
one
of
the
women
there
s
no
god
in
this
town
said
micky
s
jim
no
god
norah
exclaimed
stopping
in
the
midst
of
her
prayer
and
half
inclined
to
believe
what
micky
s
jim
was
saying
none
at
all
said
micky
s
jim
god
s
choice
about
the
company
he
keeps
and
never
comes
near
the
party
went
to
the
donegal
house
a
cheap
little
restaurant
near
the
quay
the
place
was
crowded
in
addition
to
the
potato
squad
there
were
several
harvestmen
from
various
districts
in
donegal
and
these
were
going
over
to
scotland
now
intending
to
earn
a
few
pounds
at
the
and
haymaking
before
the
real
harvest
came
on
most
of
the
harvesters
were
intoxicated
and
raised
a
terrible
hubbub
in
the
restaurant
while
taking
their
food
micky
s
jim
who
was
very
drunk
sat
on
one
chair
in
the
dingy
placed
his
feet
on
another
chair
and
with
his
back
pressed
against
the
limewashed
wall
sank
into
a
deep
slumber
the
rest
of
the
party
sat
round
a
rude
table
much
hacked
with
knives
and
had
tea
bread
and
rancid
butter
for
their
meal
a
slatternly
servant
a
native
of
donegal
served
all
customers
the
mistress
of
the
house
a
tall
thin
woman
with
a
long
nose
sharp
as
a
knife
and
eyes
cruel
enough
to
match
the
nose
cooked
the
food
the
tea
was
made
in
a
large
pot
continually
on
the
boil
when
a
bowl
of
tea
there
were
no
cups
was
lifted
out
a
similar
amount
of
water
was
put
in
to
replace
it
and
a
three
fingerful
of
tea
was
added
the
man
of
the
house
a
stout
little
fellow
with
a
red
nose
took
up
his
position
behind
the
bar
and
sold
whisky
with
lightning
rapidity
now
and
again
he
gave
a
glass
of
whisky
free
of
cost
to
some
of
the
harvesters
who
weren
t
drinking
very
heavily
those
who
got
free
drinks
usually
bought
several
glasses
of
liquor
afterwards
and
became
the
most
drunken
men
in
the
house
after
a
long
sleep
micky
s
jim
awoke
and
called
for
a
bowl
of
tea
followed
all
the
way
by
the
shrill
voice
of
her
mistress
who
was
always
scolding
somebody
the
servant
girl
carried
the
tea
to
jim
and
the
youth
drank
a
mouthful
of
it
while
rubbing
one
hand
vigorously
across
his
eyes
in
order
to
drive
the
sleep
away
from
them
this
tay
is
as
long
drawn
as
the
face
of
yer
mistress
grumbled
jim
and
the
servant
giggled

continued
turning
to
norah

on

dermod
the
tables
and
chairs
in
the
were
now
cleared
away
and
someone
suggested
getting
up
a
dance
the
harvestmen
ceased
swearing
and
began
thumping
their
hobnailed
boots
on
the
floor
willie
the
duck
played
on
a
fiddle
which
he
had
procured
years
before
for
a
few
shillings
in
a
glasgow
and
in
the
space
of
a
minute
all
the
women
including
old
maire
a
glan
who
looked
sixty
if
a
day
ranged
on
the
floor
preparatory
to
dancing
a
reel
on

the
landlord
jumped
over
the
counter
and
commenced
to

the
musician

a

enthusiasm

the
proprietor
tapping
absently
on

ii
but
the
dancing
was
in
full
swing
now
despite
the
vehemence
of
the
proprietor
he
looked
round
helplessly
and
finding
that
his
wife
was
already
dancing
with
old
eamon
doherty
he
seized
hold
of
the
servant
girl
and
whirled
her
into
the
midst
of
the
party
with
a
loud
whoop
that
surprised
himself
even
as
much
as
it
surprised
the
donegal
dancers
micky
s
jim
was
dancing
with
norah
ryan
and
pressing
her
tightly
to
his
body
the
youth
s
breath
smelt
of
whisky
and
his
movements
were
violent
and
irregular
ye
re
hurtin
me
jim
said
the
girl
and
he
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
a
seat
now
are
ye
better
he
asked
not
at
all
unkindly
will
i
get
ye
a
glass
of

don

said
the
girl
but
go
out
and
look
for
dermod
flynn
ye
said
that
ye
d
go
out
a
good
while
why

ye
so
anxious
about
him
girsha
asked
jim
one
would
think
that
he
was
a
brother
of
yours
maybe
indeed
he
paused
looked
round
then
without
another
word
he
rose
went
out
into
the
street
and
took
his
way
to
the
wharf
and
there
when
he
could
not
find
dermod
flynn
after
a
few
minutes
search
he
sat
down
on
a
capstan
lit
his
pipe
and
puffed
huge
clouds
of
smoke
up
into
the
air
now
i
wonder
why
that
norah
ryan
is
so
anxious
about
dermod
flynn
he
muttered

a
soncy
slip
of
a
when
dermod
flynn
came
along
jim
had
to
look
at
him
very
closely
before
realising
that
this
was
the
youth
whom
he
had
known
in
glenmornan
two
summers
before
dermod
stood
sturdily
on
his
legs
his
shoulders
were
broad
his
back
straight
and
his
chest
betokened
great
strength
even
now
at
the
age
of
fourteen
a
bundle
dangled
on
his
arm
one
knee
was
out
through
his
trousers
and
he
carried
a
hazel
stick
in
his
hand
patrick

dermod
exclaimed
jim
a
glance
of
glad
recognition
coming
into
his
eyes
when
he
had
stared
for
a
moment
at
flynn
by
cripes
ye
ve
grown
to
be
a
big
healthy
bucko
since
last
i
saw
dermod
flushed
with
pleasure
jim
began
to
ply
him
with
questions
about
his
work
in
tyrone
his
masters
whether
they
were
good
or
bad
and
above
all
if
he
had
ever
had
a
fight
since
he
left
home
dermod
assured
him
that
he
had
had
many
a
hard
gruelling
fight
knocked
down
a
man
twice
his
size
with
one
blow
of
his
fist
and
blackened
the
eyes
of
a
youth

a
chapter
xiii
a
wild
night
i
the
dance
came
to
an
end
and
worn
out
with
their
exertions
the
women
picked
up
their
shawls
and
wrapped
them
round
their
shoulders
then
getting
their
bundles
they
went
towards
the
wharf
willie
the
duck
leading
his
fiddle
under
his
arm
and
his
bundle
tied
over
his
shoulders
with
a
string
coming
to
the
quay
they
passed
through
a
gloomy
where
heating
bags
of
wheat
sent
a
steam
out
into
the
air
suddenly
gazing
through
the
rising
vapour
norah
saw
horses
up
in
the
sky
and
she
could
hear
them
neighing
loudly
for
a
moment
she
paused
in
terror
and
wondered
how
such
a
thing
could
be
then
recollected
that
in
a
town
where
there
was
no
god
anything
might
be
possible
once
out
in
the
open
maire
a
glan
pointed
to
the
hardly
distinguishable
at
a
distance
which
was
lifting
the
animals
off
the
pier
and
lowering
them
down
to
the
main
deck
of
the
boat
the
horses
were
turning
round
awkwardly
and
snorting
wildly
terrified
by
the
sound
of
the
sea
bags
of
grain
were
being
lifted
on
long
chains
dark
derricks
shoved
out
lean
arms
that
waved
to
and
fro
as
if
inviting
somebody
to
come
near
cattle
lowing
and
slipping
were
being
hammered
by
the
drovers
blackthorns
into
the
hold
a
tall
man
with
face
fierce
and
swarthy
eyes
bright
as
fire
and
mouth
like
a
raw
red
scar
was
roaring
out
orders
in
a
shrill
voice
and
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
all
this
norah
saw
micky
s
jim
leaning
against
the
funnel
of
the
boat
his
hands
deep
in
his
trousers
pockets
and
the
eternal
pipe
in
his
mouth
apparently
heedless
of
all
that
was
going
on
around
him
beside
jim
stood
one
whom
norah
knew
but
one
who
had
changed
a
great
deal
since
she
had
seen
him
last
as
she
went
up
the
stepping
timidly
cowering
under
the
great
derrick
that
wheeled
above
she
felt
that
a
pair
of
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
piercing
into
her
very
soul
she
turned
her
gaze
towards
the
deck
and
found
dermod
flynn
looking
straight
at
her
as
she
made
her
way
aboard
in
an
instant
her
eye
had
taken
the
whole
picture
of
the
youth
his
clothes
the
coat
much
the
worse
for
wear
his
trousers
thin
at
knee
and
frilly
at
the
his
cap
torn
at
rim
and
crown
the
stray
locks
of
hair
straggling
down
his
forehead
the
bundle
lying
at
his
feet
and
the
hazel
stick
which
he
held
in
his
hand
probably
even
yet
in
imitation
of
the
cattle
drovers
who
went
along
glenmornan
road
on
the
way
to
the
fair
of
greenanore
these
things
norah
noticed
with
a
girl
s
quick
intuitive
perception
but
what
struck
her
most
forcibly
was
dermod
s
look
of
expectation
as
he
watched
her
come
up
the
towards
him
dermod
flynn
i
hardly
knew
ye
at
all
she
said
putting
out
her
hand
and
smiling
slightly
ye
ve
got
very
big
these
last
two
so
did
you
norah
dermod
answered
looking
curiously
at
the
small
white
hand
which
he
gripped
in
his
own
you
are
almost
as
tall
as
i
am
why
wouldn
t
i
be
as
tall
as
you
are
norah
replied
although
dermod
had
unknowingly
squeezed
her
hand
in
a
hard
tense
grip
am
i
not
a
year
and
a
half
older
when
her
hand
was
released
her
skin
showed
white
where
dermod
s
fingers
had
gripped
her
but
she
did
not
feel
angry
on
the
contrary
the
girl
was
glad
because
he
was
so
strong
come
over
here
cried
maire
a

of

the
big
vessel
shuffled
out

after

of

liquor
gave
his

one
in

guts
and
knocked
him
as
sick
as

away
so
he
was
sayin
dermod
flynn

and
give
an
account
of
the
young
fellow
who
was
watching
the
waves
slide
past

side
of
the
vessel

forward
when
micky

jim
called

an
account
of
yerself
dermod
flynn
jim
cried
did
ye
not
knock
down
yer
boss
with
one
in
the
guts
that
was
the
thing
to
do
that
s
what
a
glenmornan
man
should
do
i
mind
once
when
i
was
coal
humpin
on
the
greenock
docks
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
to
his
question
jim
narrated
the
story
of
a
fight
which
had
once
taken
place
between
himself
and
a
glasgow
sailor
the
sun
red
as
a
live
coal
was
sinking
towards
the
west
the
murmur
powerful
and
gentle
of
a
trembling
wind
could
be
heard
overhead
a
white
ghostly
mist
stole
down
from
the
shore
on
either
side
and
spread
far
out
over
the
waters
the
waves
lapped
against
the
side
of
the
vessel
with
short
sudden
splashes
and
the
sound
of
the
labouring
screw
could
be
heard
pulsing
loudly
through
the
air
a
black
trail
of
smoke
spread
out
behind
a
flight
of
following
gulls
making
little
apparent
effort
easily
kept
pace
with
the
vessel
they
will
follow
us
to
scotland
said
maire
a
glan
pointing
at
the
birds
with
a
long
finger
most
of
the
men
were
drunk
a
few
lying
stretched
on
the
deck
were
already
asleep
and
the
rest
were
singing
and
quarrelling
micky
s
jim
stopped
in
the
middle
of
an
interesting
story
a
new
one
but
also
about
a
fight
and
joined
in
a
song
old
maire
a
glan
helped
him
with
the
chorus
iii
a
man
full
of
drink
and
fight
paraded
along
the
deck
his
stride
uncertain
and
unsteady
a
look
born
of
the
dark
blood
of
mischief
showing
in
his
eyes
he
had
already
been
fighting
in
his
hand
he
carried
an
open
one
eyebrow
had
been
gashed
and
the
strip
of
torn
flesh
hung
down
even
as
far
as
his
high
cheekbones
he
was
dressed
in
a
dirty
and
moleskin
trousers
a
brown
leather
belt
with
a
huge
shiny
buckle
was
tied
round
his
waist
and
the
neck
of
a
whisky
bottle
could
be
seen
peeping
over
the
rim
of
his
coat
pocket
his
shoulders
were
broad
and
massive
his
neck
short
and
wrinkled
and
the
torn
shirt
showed
his
deep
chest
alive
with
muscles
and
terribly
hairy
more
like
an
animal
s
than
a
man
s
his
hands
which
seemed
to
have
never
been
washed
were
knotted
and
gnarled
like
the
branches
of
an
old
and
stunted
bush
this
is
young
o
donnel
from
the
county
donegal
and
young
o
donnel
doesn
t
give
a
damn
for
any
man
on
this
boat
he
roared
speaking
of
himself
in
the
third
person
and
brandishing
the
knife
carelessly
around
him
i
can
fight
like
a
two
year
old
bullock
and
a
blow
from
young
o
donnel
is
like
a
kick
from
a
young
colt
that
s
new
to
the
grass
i
m
a
rosses
man
and
i
don
t
care
a
damn
for
any
soul
on
this
bloody
boat
not
one
damn
so
there
ye
are
suddenly
observing
dermod
flynn
staring
at
him
he
slouched
forward
and
struck
the
boy
heavily
across
the
face
with
a
full
swing
of
his
left
fist
dermod
dropped
quietly
to
the
deck
micky
s
jim
who
was
suggesting
to
willie
the
duck
that
the
fiddle
should
be
flung
into
the
sea
threw
down
the
instrument
which
he
held
and
jumping
on
the
top
of
o
donnel
with
a
sudden
movement
of
his
hand
sent
the
knife
flying
into
the
sea
ye
long
drink
of
water
i
ll
do
for
ye
shouted
jim
and
with
feet
and
fists
he
hammered
o
donnel
into
insensibility
dermod
flynn
regained
his
feet
with
a
swollen
cheek
and
a
long
red
gash
stretching
along
his
face
from
ear
to
chin
he
was
helped
to
a
seat
by
one
of
the
party
norah
ryan
procured
some
water
and
bathed
his
face
rubbing
her
fingers
tenderly
over
the
sore
it
was
a
shame
to
hit
ye
dermod
she
said
one
would
think
that
a
big
man
like
that
wouldn
t
hit
a
small
boy
like
yourself
dermod
flushed
and
his
eyes
lit
up
as
if
he
was
going
to
say
something
cutting
but
norah
checked
the
words
by
pressing
her
hand
across
his
brow
and
looking
at
him
with
eyes
of
womanly
understanding
i
know
what
ye
are
goin
to
say
dermod
she
said
ye
re
goin
to
tell
me
that
ye
are
a
man
and
no
one
can
deny
that
ye
were
a
man
when
ye
were
at
school
and
hit
the
master
sure
i
know
meself
what
ye
had
in
yer
head
to
dermod
resented
the
words
of
consolation
and
felt
like
rising
and
walking
away
from
the
girl
if
her
fair
fingers
had
not
been
pressing
so
softly
and
tenderly
against
his
cheek
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
resigned
himself
to
the
ministrations
of
norah
by
god
i
wasn
t
long
with
him
cried
micky
s
jim
kicking
idly
at
willie
the
duck
s
fiddle
which
still
lay
on
the
deck
i
just
gave
him
one
in
the
jaw
and
three
on
the
guts
ah
that
was
the
way
to
do
it
it
takes
a
glenmornan
kiddie
to
use
his
mits
in
this
bloomin
hole
glenmornan
and
every
inch
of
it
forever
whoo
there
s
no
man
on
this
boat
could
take
a
rise
out
of
me
not
one
mother
s
son
fight
i
could
fight
any
damned
mug
aboard
this
bleedin
vessel
look
at
my
fist
smell
it
there
s
the
smell
of
dead
men
off
it
micky
s
jim
now
doubly
drunk
with
liquor
and
excitement
paced
up
and
down
the
deck
challenging
all
aboard
to
fight
to
put
up
their
fives
to
him
presently
the
quarrel
became
general
all
along
the
deck
and
down
in
the
steerage
cabin
a
terrible
uproar
broke
forth
men
fastened
on
to
one
another
s
throats
kicking
tearing
and
cursing
loudly
the
darkness
had
fallen
the
buoys
floating
past
bobbed
up
and
down
in
the
water
their
little
bright
lights
twinkling
merrily
the
pale
ghost
of
a
moon
stole
into
the
heavens
and
a
million
stars
kept
it
company
but
those
aboard
the
derry
boat
took
little
heed
of
the
moon
or
stars
over
coils
of
ropes
loose
chains
boxes
and
bundles
sleeping
women
and
crying
babies
they
staggered
fought
and
fell
trampling
everything
with
which
they
came
in
contact
a
man
went
headlong
down
the
steerage
stair
and
a
second
followed
thrown
from
above
beside
the
door
a
bleeding
face
out
of
which
gleamed
a
pair
of
lustrous
eyes
glowered
sinister
for
a
moment
a
fist
hit
sharply
against
the
eyebrows
the
eyes
closed
a
knife
shone
glancing
brightly
against
the
woodwork
the
man
with
the
bloodstained
face
groaned
and
fell
a
woman
crouching
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
was
trampled
upon
she
shrieked
and
the
shriek
changed
into
a
volley
of
curses
which
in
turn
died
away
into
a
low
murmurous
plaint
of
tearful
pity
men
sought
one
another
s
faces
grunting
and
gasping
long
lean
arms
stretched
out
everywhere
and
fists
shot
through
the
atmosphere
of
the
steerage
splotches
of
blood
showed
darkly
on
the
deck
somewhere
from
below
came
the
tinkle
of
glasses
and
the
loud
chorus
of
an
irish
the
fighters
overcome
by
their
mad
exertion
collapsed
three
or
four
in
a
heap
and
slept
where
they
had
fallen
outside
on
the
open
deck
micky
s
jim
lay
prostrate
his
head
on
the
lap
of
maire
a
glan
who
was
also
asleep
her
two
remaining
upper
teeth
and
yellow
showing
in
the
moonlight
all
over
the
deck
men
and
women
lay
curled
up
like
dogs
near
the
rail
a
woman
s
bare
arm
showed
for
a
moment
over
a
bundle
of
rags
then
twined
snakelike
round
the
neck
of
a
sleeping
child
on
a
bench
astern
norah
ryan
sat
her
shawl
drawn
tightly
over
her
head
and
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
sea
that
stretched
out
behind
a
great
loneliness
had
overcome
her
a
loneliness
which
she
did
not
understand
it
seemed
as
if
something
had
snapped
within
her
as
if
every
fabric
of
her
life
had
been
torn
to
shreds
the
stars
overhead
looked
so
cold
everything
seemed
so
desolate
a
chill
wind
swept
against
her
face
and
she
could
hear
the
water
soughing
along
the
vessel
s
side
and
crying
wearily
snores
groans
and
sleepy
voices
came
through
the
open
doors
and
resounded
in
the
passage
at
the
head
of
the
steerage
stairs
human
bodies
were
heaped
together
in
compact
masses
everywhere
the
fighting
had
come
to
an
end
though
now
and
then
as
a
flame
flickers
up
for
a
second
over
a
dying
fire
a
man
would
totter
from
a
drunken
sleep
and
challenge
everybody
on
board
to
fight
him
but
even
when
speaking
loudest
he
would
drop
to
the
deck
with
a
thud
and
fall
asleep
again
iv
listening
to
the
engine
pulsing
heavily
and
the
propeller
hitting
the
water
with
an
intermittent
buzz
norah
ryan
fell
asleep
on
opening
her
eyes
again
she
could
see
the
moon
further
up
the
sky
and
the
stars
twinkling
colder
than
ever
dermod
flynn
his
face
swollen
horribly
was
beside
her
looking
at
her
and
she
was
pleased
to
see
him
sit
down
beside
me
dermod
she
said
it
will
be
warmer
for
he
sat
down
his
eyes
sparkling
with
pleasure
the
girl
nestled
close
to
his
side
in
the
darkness
and
one
timid
little
hand
stole
softly
into
his
ye
nearly
squeezed
the
hand
off
me
when
i
met
ye
this
evenin
she
said
but
there
was
no
reproof
in
her
voice
and
he
understood
that
she
was
not
angry
with
his
strong
handshake
even
though
it
had
given
her
pain
did
i
ye
did
isn
t
it
cold
cold
as
the
breath
of
a
stepmother
said
dermod
there
was
great
fighting
why
do
men
always
fight
asked
norah
because
it
s
it
s
their
why
is
that
you
ll
not
understand
you
re
only
a
will
i
never
understand
asked
norah
never
dermod
answered
and
we
re
goin
to
be
sick
too
he
went
on
with
boyish
irrelevance
that
s
when
we
re
passin
round
the
mull
of
cantyre
so
micky
s
jim
said
and
we
re
goin

glenmornan
hills
and
old
oiney
dinchy
he
got
one
of
his
eyes
knocked
out
with
the
horns
of
a
cow
that
was
because
the
priest
put
the
seven
curses
on
him
but

dermod
exclaimed
fixing
a
pair
of
sad
eyes
on
the
girl
well
it
is
a
wonder
that
we
re
not
hearin
from
him
norah
went
on
a
great
wonder
entirely
your
face
is
very
is
it
sore
now
the
conversation
died
away
the
boy
and
girl
pressed
closer
for
warmth
and
presently
both
were
asleep
when
they
awoke
the
pale
dawn
was
breaking
a
drunken
man
lay
asleep
at
their
feet
his
face
turned
upwards
one
arm
stretched
out
at
full
length
and
the
other
curled
over
his
breast
beside
him
on
the
deck
was
an
empty
whisky
bottle
and
the
bowl
of
a
broken
clay
pipe
have
ye
seen
scotland
yet
asked
the
girl
rubbing
her
fingers
over
her
eyelids
that

think

answered
pointing
at
the
coastline
which
showed
like
a
cloud
against
the
miles
away
have
we
passed
paddy
s
milestone
i
don
t
know
i
was
sleepin
isn

and
the
boy
and

laughed
together
chapter
xiv
beyond
the
water
i
a
heavy
fall
of
rain
came
with
the
dawn
and
the
clyde
was
a
dreary
smudge
of
grey
when
the
boat
made
fast
alongside
greenock
quay
and
discharged
its
passengers
again
the
derricks
began
to
creak
complainingly
on
their
pivots
a
mob

excited
cattle
streamed
up
the
narrow
gangways

by
swearing
drovers

prodded
the

and
hindquarters
of
the

with
their
short
heavy
blackthorn
sticks
a
tall
thin
man
somewhat
over
middle
age
with
bushy

small
penetrating
eyes
and
wrinkles
between

the

asked
micky

jim
although

the
number
of
men
it
contained

an
air
of
importance

to

the
merchant
his
adam
s
apple
bobbing
in

of
his
throat
he

a
few
of

with
opposite
the
squad
a
dozen
or
more
men
and
women
stood
looking
on
eagerly
all
of
them
shivering
with
the
cold
and
the
water
dripping
from
their
rags
these
jim
approached
with
a
very
swagger
and
entered
into
conversation
with
the
women
who
began
to
speak
volubly
what
s
wrong
with
them
asked
dermod
flynn
and
maire
a
glan
to
whom
he
addressed
the
question
drew
a
from
her
pocket
and
took
a
pinch
they
re
lookin
for
a
job
as
the
man
said
she
answered
and
her
teeth
chattered
as
she
spoke
when

start
our
work
asked
norah
ryan

laughed
judy
farrel
and
her
laugh
ended
in
a
fit
of
coughing
work
indeed
she
stammered
on
regaining
breath
ye
ll
soon

plenty
of
that
and
no
fear

now
micky
s
jim
shouted
as
he
came
back
to
his
own
squad
followed
by
two
men
and
two
women
who
detached
themselves
from
the
crowd
that
was
looking
for
work
we
must
go
down
to
the
isle
of
bute
and
get
some
potatoes
dug

a
hurry

and

a
start
for

that
s
in
it
said
maire
a
glan
when
the
strange
women
came
forward
gourock
ellen
and
annie
as
the
man
gourock
ellen
was
a
tall
angular
woman
who
might
at
one
period
of
her
life
have
been
very
handsome
but
who
now
owing
to
the
results
of
a
hard
and
loose
life
bore
all
the
indelible
marks
of
dissolute
and
careless
living
her
face
was
hard
and
stamped
with
a
look
of
impudent
defiance
she
smiled
with
contempt
at
maire
a
glan
and
looked
with
mock
curiosity
at
the
warty
hand
which
the
old
woman
held
out
to
her
there
s
a
lot
of
new
faces
in
the
squad
she
said
glancing
in
turn
at
norah
ryan
and
dermod
flynn
not

of

to
whom
she
addressed
this
question
i
don

t
answered
the
woman
and
her
tones
implied
that
she
would
have
added
you
fool
if
she
thought
it
worth
while
her
companion
who
hardly
spoke
a
word
was
somewhat
older
swarthy
of
appearance
and
very
ragged
her
toes
peeped
out
through
the
torn
uppers
of
her
hobnailed
boots
and
when
she
lifted
her
dress
to
wring
the
water
from
the
hem
it
could
be
seen
that
she
wore
no
stockings
and
that
her
dark
thin
legs
were
threaded
with
varicose
veins
above
the
calves
d
ye
see
them
micky
s
jim
whispered
in
dermod

ear

whispered
rubbing
his
hand
over
the
sore
on
his
face
by
god

was
a
great
dunt
that
o
donnel
gave

a
long
while
since

sure
said
willie
who
did
not
know
what
jim
was
speaking
about
but
wished
to
be
agreeable
to
everybody
ii
a
short
run
on
a
fast
train
from
upper
greenock
to
wemyss
bay
was
followed
by
an
hour
s
journey
on
a
boat
crowded
with
passengers
bound
for
rothesay
it
was
now
the
last
day
of
june
and
those
who
had
rented
coast
houses
for
the
following
month
were
flocking
down
from
glasgow
and
other
clydeside
industrial
centres
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
of
gaily
dressed
trippers
all
the
members
of
the
squad
felt
sensitive
and
shy
and
stood
huddled
awkwardly
together
on
deck
all
but
micky
s
jim
and
the
strange
men
and
women
who
paraded
up
and
down
the
deck
careless
of
the
eyes
that
were
fixed
upon
them
old
maire
a
glan
was
praying
her
rosary
hidden
under
her
shawl
dermod
flynn
was
looking
over
the
rail
into
the
water
his
main
interest
in
turning
away
being
to
keep
the
naked
knee
that
peeped
through
his
torn
trousers
hidden
from
the
sight
of
the
elegantly
dressed
trippers
norah
envied
the
young
girls
who
chattered
noisily
to
and
fro
envied
them
their
fine
hats
and
brave
dresses
their
elegant
shoes
and
the
wonderful
sparkling
things
that
decorated
their
necks
and
wrists
what
a
splendid
vision
for
the
girl
s
eyes
the
hot
sun
overhead
in
a
sky
of
blue
the
water
glancing
brightly
as
the
boat
cut
through
it
the
fair
women
the
men
the
band
playing
on
deck
the
glitter
the
charm
and
the
happiness
the
girl
could
hardly
realise
that
such
beauty
existed
though
once
she
had
seen
a
picture
of
a
scene
something
like
this
in
one
of
the
books
which
fergus
used
to
read
at
home
poor
girl
the
water
was
still
running
down
her
stockings
her
clothes
were
ragged
and
dirty
and
the
boy
her
youthful
lover
was
hiding
his
naked
knee
by
turning
to
the
rail
opposite
the
crowd
in
which
norah
stood
a
group
of
five
persons
father
mother
and
their
children
a
son
and
two
daughters
were
sitting
on
the
man
and
short
had
taken
off
his
hat
and
in
the
sunlight
beads
of
sweat
glittered
on
his
bald
head
like
crystals
in
a
white
limestone
facing
his
wife
a
plump
woman
who
seemed
full
of
a
haughty
gazed
critically
through
a
lorgnette
on
the
unkempt
workers
and
sniffed
contemptuously
as
if
something
had
displeased
her
when
her
examinations
came
to
an
end
the
three
little
things
regarded
them
wonderingly
for
a
moment
and
afterwards
began
to
ply
first
the
father
and
then
the
mother
with
questions
about
the
strange
folk
who
were
aboard
the
boat
but
the
parents
finding
that
the
children
were
speaking
too
loudly
bade
them
be
silent
and
the
little
ones
getting
no
answer
to
their
questions
began
to
puzzle
over
this
and
wonder
who
and
what
were
the
queer
ragged
people
sitting
opposite
the
girls
taking
into
account
the
contemptuous
stare
which
their
mother
fixed
on
the
members
of
the
squad
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
beings
who
were
dressed
so
differently
from
themselves
were
really
other
species
of
men
and
women
altogether
and
were
far
inferior
to
those
who
wore
starched
collars
and
gold
ornaments
the
boy
an
undersized
little
fellow
with
sharp
twinkling
eyes
looked
at
his
father
when
putting
his
questions
but
the
old
man
pulled
a
paper
christian
from
his
pocket
and
burying
himself
in
it
took
no
notice
of
the
youngster
s
queries
the
boy
solved
the
question
for
himself
in
the
curious
incomplete
way
which
is
peculiar
to
a
child
i
don
t
know
who
they
are
he
said
but
i
d
like
to
play
with
them
that
old
lady
who
s
moving
something
under
her
shawl
and
speakin
to
herself
with
the
nice
young
lady
with
the
man
with
the
hump
and
the
fiddle
with
every
one
of
gourock
ellen
was
speaking
to
micky

ellen
fiercely

pretty

annie
jim
asked

a
match
to
the
eternal
pipe
she

ellen
replied

brats

how
they
re
glowerin
at
norah
ryan
the
children

very
pretty
said
the
woman
and
a
slight
touch
of
regret
softened
her
harsh
voice
perhaps
for
the
moment
she
longed
for
the
children
which
might
have
been
hers
if
all
had
gone
well
norah
ryan
is
a
very
soncy
wench

assuming
a
knowing
look

winking
slightly
it

was
young

ye

jim
whistled
taking
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
lowering
the
left
eyelid
he
was
one
of
them
sort
indeed
a
decent
man

hardly
pass

a
way
that
his
bare
knee

a
great

grand

iii
a
farmer
with
a
bulbous
nose
and
red
whiskers
met
the
squad
on
rothesay
pier
he
wore
a
black
jacket
which
being
too
narrow
round
the
shoulders
had
split
open
half
way
down
the
back
a
corduroy
waistcoat
very
tight
trousers
patched
at
the
knees
and
caked
brown
with
clotted
earth
this
man
was
seated
on
the
sideboard
of
a
large
waggon
removing
the
dirt
from
his
clothes
with
a
heavy
said
micky
s
jim
coming
off
the
boat
and
stepping
up
to
the
man
on
the
waggon
answered
the
man
without
lifting
his
head
or
looking
at
the
speaker
will
ye
take
the
waggon
nearer
the
boat
or
will
we
carry
up
the
bundles
to
here
asked
jim
blowing
a
puff
of
white
smoke
into
the
air
carry
them
up
of
course
said
the
farmer
still
busy
with
his
jim
set
his
squad
to
work
and
soon
the
waggon
was
loaded
with
bundles
of
clothes
tins
bowls
and
other
articles
necessary
for
the
workers
during
the
coming
months
in
addition
to
the
stores
taken
from
ireland
by
the
the
merchant
supplied
them
with
blankets
an
open
stove
and
a
pot
for
boiling
potatoes
it
was
now
raining
heavily
the
drops
splashed
loudly
on
the
streets
ran
down
the
faces
and
soaked
through
the
clothes
of
the
workers
the
rain
struck
heavily
against
the
waggon
a
hot
steam
rose
from
the
withers
of
the
the
pier
was
almost
deserted
and
everything
looked
lonesome
and
gloomy
so
far
the
farmer
had
taken
very
little
notice
of
anybody
but
now
having
observed
norah
ryan
he
shouted
ye
have
a
fine
leg
lassie
and
afterwards
while
the
cart
was
being
loaded
he
kept
repeating
this
phrase
and
chuckling
deep
down
in
his
throat
whenever
he
made
the
remark
he
looked
at
the
girl
and
norah
felt
uncomfortable
and
blushed
every
time
he
spoke
dermod
flynn
who
had
taken
a
sudden
dislike
to
the
man
with
the
bulbous
nose
now
felt
sorry
for
norah
and
angry
with
the
man
at
last
unable
to
restrain
his
passion
any
longer
he
stepped
up
to
the
side
of
the
waggon
and
looked
straight
in
the
face
of
the
farmer
who
was
packing
the
blankets
in
one
corner
of
the
vehicle
and
shouted
here
red
nose
don
t
try
and
make
fun
of
yer
betters
the
farmer
straightened
himself
up
rested
his
thumb
on
his
jaw
and
pulled
a
long
black
finger
through
his
beard
all
right
he
said
at
last
and
did
not
speak
another
word
to
anybody
else
that
day
dermod
who
had
looked
for
an
outburst
felt
frightened
when
the
farmer
became
silent
jim
what
s
wrong
with
that
man
he
asked
his
ganger
when
the
cart
started
on
its
journey
home
with
the
farmer
sitting
in
front
waving
his
whip
vigorously
but
refraining
from
hitting
the
horse
he
s
mad
said
jim
in
a
whisper
mad
as
a
march
hare
as
an
epiphany
cock
as
a
he
s
very
mad
and
was
in
the
madhouse
last
year
when
we
were
digging
on
the
farm
it
takes
very
little
to
set
him
off
maybe
he
s
goin
mad
now
one
never
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
stand
up
for
me
said
norah
to
dermod
about
an
hour
later
when
the
party
came
in
sight
of
the
farmhouse
ye
have
the
kind
heart
and
that
farmer
isn
t
a
nice
man
i
don
t

looks
of

mad
mother
of
god
as
an
epiphany
cock
he
was
in
the
madhouse
last
maybe
he
ll
do
ye
some
harm
one
day
will
he
asked
dermod
squaring
his
shoulders
and
instinctively
tightening
his
fists
somehow
he
felt
wonderfully
elated
since
he
had
spoken
to

as
possible
dug
on
the
first
afternoon
no
sooner
had
the
squad
come
to
the
farmhouse
than
they
were
shown
out
to
the
fields
where
the
green
shaws
heavy
with
rain
lay
in
matted
clusters
across
the
drills
every
step
taken
relieved
the
green
vegetable
matter
of
an
enormous
amount
of
water
which
splashed
all
over
the
workers
as
they
stumbled
along
to
their
toil
work
started
the
men
threw
out
the
potatoes
with
short
graips
the
women
girt

went
down

and
followed
the
diggers
picking
up
the
potatoes
which
they
threw
out
two
wicker
baskets
without
handles
were
supplied
to
each

one

furrowed
her
way
through
the
slushy
earth

but
judy
struggling
with
a
potato
stem

to

was
a
hard
worker
and
it
was
her
boast
that
she
never
had
had
a
day
s
illness
in
her
life
the
story
had
got
abroad
that
she
never
missed
a
stitch
in
a
stocking
while
giving
birth
to
twins
and
the
woman
never
contradicted
the
story
she
gathered
after

graip

a
head
rising
to
a
point
almost
and
a
very
short

of

children
all
gone
now
to
all
the
seven
ends
of

often
pathetically
remarked

the
potatoes
that
murtagh
gallagher
threw
out
biddy
s
hair
was
as
white
as
snow
except
on
her
chin
where
a
dozen
or
more
black
hairs
stood
out
as
stiffly
as
if
they
were
starched
owen
kelly
another
of
the
diggers
was
very
miserly
and
was
eternally
complaining
of
a
pain
in
the
back
micky
s
jim
assured
him
that
a
wife
was
the
best
cure
in
the
world
for
a
sore
back
but
owen
skinflint
that
he
was
considered
a
wife
very
costly
property
and
preferred
to
live
without
one
he
dug
for
judy
farrel
the
stunted
little
creature
with
the
cough
she
was
a
very
quiet
little
woman
judy
had
very
little
to
say
and
when
speaking
spoke
as
if
her
mouth
was
full
of
something
when
pulling
the
heavy
baskets
weighted
with
the
wet
clay
she
moaned
constantly
like
a
child
in
pain
two
sisters
worked
in
the
squad
dora
and
bridget
doherty
cheery
girls
who
spoke
a
lot
laughed
easily
and
who
were
similar
in
appearance
and
very
ugly
dora
worked
with
connel
dinchy
son
of
oiney
dinchy
an
youth
over
six
foot
in
height
and
barely
measuring
inches
round
the
chest
he
was
a
quiet
inoffensive
fellow
who
laughed
down
in
his
throat
and
every
fortnight
he
sent
all
his
wages
home
to
his
parents
bridget
doherty
gathered
potatoes
for
one
of
the
strange
men
both
girls
were
blood
relations
of
murtagh
gallagher
the
other
strange
man
worked
in
conjunction
with
gourock
ellen
norah
ryan
gathered
for
willie
the
duck
and
ellen
s
companion
who
was
known
as
annie
simply
annie
crawled
in
the
clay
after
thady
scanlon
a
first
cousin
of
micky
s
jim
when
the
baskets
were
full
dermod
flynn
emptied
the
potatoes
into
large
barrels
supplied
for
the
purpose
the
women
worked
hard
trying
to
keep
themselves
warm
norah
ryan
became
weary
very
soon
the
rain
formed
into
a
little
pond
in
the
hollow
of
her
dress
where
it
covered
the
calves
of
her
legs
seeing
that
the
rest
of
the
women
were
rising
from
time
to
time
and
shaking
the
water
off
their
clothes
she
followed
their
example
and
when
standing
a
slight
dizziness
caused
her
to
reel
unsteadily
and
she
almost
overbalanced
and
fell
she
went
down
on
her
knees
hurriedly
as
she
did
not
want
micky
s
jim
to
see
her
tottering
if
this
was
noticed
he
might
think
her
unfit
for
the
job
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
she
crawled
steadily
fearing
to
rise
and
wondered
how
gourock
ellen
who
was
giving
voice
to
a
loose
and
humorous
song
could
sing
on
such
a
day
what
troubled
norah
most
were
the
sharp
pebbles
that
came
in
contact
with
her
knees
as
she
dragged
herself
along
they
seemed
to
pierce
through
rags
and
flesh
at
each
movement
and
at
times
she
could
hardly
refrain
from
crying
aloud
on
account
of
the
pain
before
night
and
when
she
knew
that
her
knees
were
bleeding
she
had
become
almost
indifferent
to
bodily
discomforts
all
the
time
she
was
filled
with
an
insatiable
longing
for
home
the
farm
looked
out
on
the
clyde
the
river
was
a
grey
blur
seen
through
the
driving
rain
and
a
boat
passing
by
attracted
her
attention
is
it
an
irish
boat
she
asked
willie
the
duck
who
was
whistling
softly
to
himself
aye
sure
answered
willie
without
raising
his
head
i
wish
that
i

home
in

said
plaintively

for

scotchwoman
annie

ii
when

into

the

sat
round

their
little
tins
of
milk
in
their
hands
and
proceeded
to
eat
their
supper
the
potato
was
held
in
the
left
hand
and
stripped
of
its
jacket
with
the
nail
of
the
right
thumb
gourock
ellen
used
a
knife
when
peeling
willie
the
duck
ate
potato
pelt
and
all
while
they
were
sitting
an
old
wrinkled
and
crooked
man
came
across
the
top
of
the
sinking
into
it
almost
up
to
his
knees
and
approached
the
fire
his
clothes
were
held
on
by
strings
he
wore
a
pair
of
boots
differing
one
from
the
other
in
size
shape
and
colour
indeed
they
were
almost
without
shape
and
the
old
man
s
toes
pink
with
black
nails
showed
through
the
uppers
gourock
ellen
handed
him
three
large
potatoes
from
the
basket
god

yerself

the
kindly

decent
woman
said
the
old
fellow
in
a
feeble
voice
and
he
began
to
eat
his
potatoes
hurriedly
like
a
dog
dermod
handed
him
part
of
a
tin
of
milk
and
blushed
at
the
profuse
thanks
of
the
stranger
it
s
a
fine
warm
place
that
ye

inside

night
said
the
old

meal
it
s
a
rotten
place
said
dermod
flynn
it

nor
lyin
under
a
hedge
answered
the
old
man
or
under
a
bridge
gourock
ellen
remarked
lifting
her
dress
again
then
as
if
some
modest
thought
had
struck
her
dropping
it
suddenly
why
do
ye
lie
under
a
hedge
dermod
asked
and
the
old
man
thereupon
gave
a
rambling
account
of
his
misfortunes
which
included
a
sore
back
and
inability
to
labour
along
with
sound
men
he
had
come
from
mayo
years
ago
and
had
worked
at
many
a
hard
job
since
then
both
in
england
and
scotland
now
that
he
was
a
homeless
old
man
nobody
at
all
wanted
him
when
the
party
went
up
to
the
byre
he
stretched
out
his
old
thin
limbs
by
the
fire
and
fell
into
the
easy
slumber
of
old
age
suddenly
he
awoke
with
a
start
to
find
the
fire
still
burning
brightly
and
a
beautiful
girl
with
long
hair
flung
over
her
shoulders
looking
at
him
it
was
norah
ryan
the
old
man
thought
for
a
moment
that
he
was
looking
at
an
angel
god
be
good
to
me
he
cried
crossing
himself
but
who
is
yerself
then
as
recollection
brought
him
a
face
seen
at
the
fire
he
exclaimed
arrah
sure

yerself
that

the
colleen

said
the
old
man
resting
one
elbow
in
the
ashes
there
is
nothin
but
the
rainy
roads
and
the
hardships
for
a
man
like
but
could
ye
not
get
inside
of
some
house
for
the
night
god

said
the
old
fellow
laughing
feebly
ye
re
just
new
over
i
ll
warrant
and
ye
haven
t
come
to
learn
that
they
have
forgotten
all
about

in
this
country
they
do
not
want
the
man
with
no
over
his
head
here
they
re
all

and
bitter
so

asked
norah
drawing
the
purse
from
the
pocket
of
her
steaming
dress
if
only
i
had
the
price
of
the
boat

minute
said
the
man
fixing
greedy
eyes
on
the
purse
which
norah
held
in
her
hand
but
i
m
very
poor
and
mind
ye
i
m
one
of
yer

sort

sixpence

he
said
norah
possessed
a
piece
all
the
money
she
had
in
the
world
and
she
needed
it
badly
herself
but
the
desire
to
help
the
old
man
overmastered
her
and
she
handed
him
the
florin
followed
by
the
garrulous
thanks
of
her
penniless
countryman
she
hurried
back
to
the
byre
feeling
in
some
curious
way
ashamed
of
her
kindness
iii
a
candle
fixed
on
the
top
of
a
stanchion
threw
a
dim
light
over
the
byre
and
long
black
shadows
danced
on
roof
and
wall
a
strong
unhealthy
odour
pervaded
the
whole
building
the
tap
at
one
end
was
running
and
as
the
screw
had
been
broken
the
water
could
not
be
turned
off

stripped
to
the
pelt
stood
for
a
moment
laughing
stupidly
the
guttering
candle
lighting
up
his
narrow
hairy
face
and
sunken
chest
old

already
in

we
were
almost
eaten
alive
by
the

the
women
undressed
in
the
shadow
at
the
far
end
of
the
stalls
and
from
time
to
time
micky
s
jim
peeped
round
the
corner
when
the
women
looked
up
he
would
shout
out
i
see
something
and
whistle
lightly
between
the
thumb
and
middle
finger
of
his
right
hand
the
irishwomen
undressed
under
the
blankets
the
two
strange
women
careless
and
indifferent
to
the
jibes
of
micky

jim
stripped
off
to
their
chemises
in
full
view
of
the
occupants
of

quarrelled
about
something
they
were
not
going

together
that
night

sleep
with
me
lass
said
gourock
ellen
to
norah
all
right
said
the
young
girl
quietly
seeing
no
reason
why
she
should
not
sleep
with
a
strange
woman
as
she
spoke
she
went
down
on
her
knees
to
say
her
prayers
say
one
prayer
for
me
just
a
short
one
said
ellen
in
a

after

short
interval

not
be
ashamed
to
go
on
takin
off
their
clothes
the
light
went
out
but
jim
suddenly
relit
the
candle
and
the
guttering
blaze
again
flared
weakly
through
the
gloom
there
was
a
hurried
movement
of
naked
flesh
in
the
women
s
quarters
and
a
precipitate
scampering
under
the
blankets
that
was
a
mortal
sin
micky

jim
norah
ryan
said
in
a
low
voice
and
in
her
tones
there
was
a
suspicion
of
tears
chapter
xvi
little
loves
i
to
norah
ryan
the
days
passed
by
at
first
remorselessly
slow
burdened
with
longings
and
regrets
clogged
with
cares
and
sorrows
which
pressed
heavily
on
her
young
heart
each
passing
day
was
very
much
like
that
which
had
gone
before
all
had
their
homesickness
and
longings
she
wanted
so
much
to
be
back
in
her
own
home
picking
cockles
from
the
frosses
strand
or
driving
the
cattle
into
the
shallow
water
when
the
heat
of
summer
put
the
wild
madness
into
their
dry
hooves
all
day
long
she
trailed
in
the
fields
her
knees
sore
and
the
sharp
flinty
pebbles
cutting
them
to
the
bone
and
at
night
when
she
undressed
she
found
her
petticoats
and
stockings
covered
with
blood
gourock
ellen
showed
a
great
interest
in
the
girl
bathed
norah
s
knees
often
and
when
near
a
druggist
s
bought
liniments
and
ointments
which
she
applied
to
the
wounds
usually
the
sores
though
they
healed
a
little
during
the
night
broke
afresh
when
work
started
again
in
the
morning
and
six
weeks
went
by
before
the
girl
hardened
sufficiently
to
resist
the
rough
pressure
of
the
stones
which
she
had
to
crawl
over
when
at
her
work
in
the
fields
her
hands
also
troubled
her
for
a
while
they
became
hacked
and
swollen
and
pained
her
intensely
when
she
washed
them
at
close
of
evening
gradually
these
physical
discomforts
passed
away
and
with
them
went
many
of
the
girl
s
regrets
and
much
of
her
homesickness
true
she
wished
to
be
back
with
her
mother
again
and
that
wish
unable
to
be
gratified
caused
her
many
poignant
heartaches
which
she
bravely
concealed
from
her
companions
every
sunday
afternoon
she
sat
down
and
wrote
a
long
letter
home
telling
her
mother
of
the
wonderful
land
across
the
water
and
the
curious
things
which
were
to
be
seen
there
her
mother
not
being
able
to
read
or
write
answered
very
seldom
and
her
letters
were
all
penned
by
the
new
master
of
glenmornan
schoolhouse
the
members
of
the
squad
lived
a
very
stirring
life
changing
almost
weekly
from
one
farm
to
another
travelling
on
fast
trains
and
wonderful
steamers
but
in
the
midst
of
all
this
excitement
maire
a
glan
never
forgot
to
tell
her
beads
owen
kelly
to
save
up
his
money
micky
s
jim
to
swear
about
nothing
in
particular
and
norah
never
forgot
to
speak
about
home
when
any
of
the
frosses
people
were
in
the
mood
to
listen
dermod
flynn
ever
eager
to
hear
about
all
that
had
passed
in
his
two
years
absence
was
a
ready
talker
on
matters
that
concerned
the
people
of
glenmornan
and
frosses
but
in
other
respects
he
was
still
the
same
dreamy
youth
who
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
time
at
school
in
gazing
out
of
the
window
even
now
he
would
sometimes
forget
his
work
for
a
long
while
to
gaze
at
a
worm
which
he
picked
up
from
the
ground
and
held
between
his
finger
and
thumb
whenever
micky
s
jim
saw
this
he
would
assert
that
flynn
was
rapidly
going
mad
norah
herself
often
wished
that
dermod
would
not
take
such
an
interest
in
things
which
when
all
was
said
and
done
were
useless
and
made
the
boy
the
of
the
whole
squad
but
she
always
felt
sorry
for
him
when
the
rest
of
the
party
laughed
at
his
oddities
why
should
she
care
if
everybody
in
the
country
laughed
at
a
fool
who
took
a
great
interest
in
common
worms
she
often
asked
herself
but
never
was
the
girl
able
to
find
a
satisfactory
answer
to
this
question
dermod
had
a
curious
habit
of
going
out
into
the
fields
and
lying
down
on
the
green
sod
when
the
evening
was
a
good
one
and
when
the
day
s
work
was
done
norah
noticed
this
and
often
wondered
what
he
did
and
thought
of
when
by
himself
the
youth
fascinated
the
girl
in
some
strange
way
this
fascination
she
could
not
explain
and
dared
not
combat
she
even
felt
afraid
of
him
he
thronged
into
her
mind
banished
all
other
thoughts
and
reigned
supreme
in
her
imagination
sometimes
indeed
she
wished
that
he
were
gone
from
the
squad
altogether
he
made
her
so
uncomfortable
he
said
such
strange
things
too
once
he
remarked
that
there
was
no
god
and
norah
knew
instinctively
that
he
meant
what
he
said
not
like
micky
s
jim
who
often
said
that
there
was
no
creator
merely
with
the
object
of
startling
those
to
whom
he
was
speaking
if
dermod
did
things
like
other
people
if
he
played
cards
passed
jests
she
would
not
fear
him
so
much
even
now
when
he
spoke
to
her
of
home
there
was
a
strange
intensity
in
his
voice
that
often
unnerved
her
ii
one
evening
in
september
dermod
flynn
stole
away
from
the
fire
as
was
his
custom
and
sat
down
in
a
field
near
the
sea
where
he
was
speedily
buried
in
the
quiet
isolation
of
his
own
thoughts
norah
ryan
followed
him
why
she
did
not
know
something
seemed
to
compel
her
to
go
after
the
youth
a
certain
wild
pleasure
surged
through
her
she
felt
as
if
she
could
run
and
sing
out
to
the
light
airs
that
fanned
her
cheeks
as
she
moved
along
presently
looking
through
a
row
of
hazel
bushes
that
hemmed
the
farmhouse
she
espied
him
lying
on
the
green
grass
seemingly
lost
to
everything
and
gazing
upwards
into
the
blue
heavens
where
the
first
early
star
was
flickering
faintly
through
the
soft
loom
of
the
evening
below
him
the
clyde
widened
out
to
the
sea
and
a
few
black
boats
were
heaving
slowly
on
the
tide
as
if
under
the
spell
of
a
power
which
she
could
not
resist
norah
ryan
parted
the
boughs
of
the
hazel
copse
and
stood
before
dermod
flynn
is
it
here
dermod
that
ye
are
lookin
at
the
sea
she
asked
involuntarily
i
was
lookin
at
the
star
above
me
he
replied
norah
wore
a
soft
grey
tweed
dress
that
became
her
well
she
had
bought
it
in
greenock
a
week
before
and
when
dermod
looked
at
the
dress
with
a
critical
eye
she
wondered
why
she
had
put
it
on
but
his
look
turned
to
one
of
admiration
when
his
eye
fell
on
the
sweet
face
of
the
young
girl
the
eyes
gentle
and
wistful
the
white
neck
and
the
pure
brow
half
hidden
by
the
brown
ruffled
tresses
something
leapt
into
the
heart
of
the
young
man
a
thought
which
he
could
not
put
into
words
flashed
through
his
mind
held
him
tense
for
a
moment
and
then
flitted
away
why
do
you
keep
watchin
me
norah
enquired
i
don
t
know
dermod
answered
lowering
his
eyes
d
ye
mind
the
night
on
the
derry
boat
he
asked
all
that
night
when
you
were
asleep
i
had
your
hand
in
i
mind
it
very
well
she
said
and
a
slight
blush
stole
into
her
cheeks
they
clasped
hands
the
girl
s
fingers
stole
over
dermod
s
and
their
eyes
met
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
one
or
the
other
was
going
to
speak
but
no
voice
broke
the
stillness
the
fear
had
now
gone
from
norah
s
heart
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
her
that
she
should
be
there
clasping
the
hand
of
that
ragged
youth
who
always
attracted
and
fascinated
her
that
she
should
desire
to
sit
beside
him
to
press
his
hands
so
very
tightly
did
not
appear
strange
to
her
and
above
all
did
not
appear
wrong
dermod
saw
in
her
eyes
a
childlike
admiration
a
look
half
a
child
s
and
half
a
woman
s
a
vague
longing
something
which
he
could
not
comprehend
and
which
caused
him
a
momentary
pang
of
fear
rose
in
his
heart
what
he
had
to
be
afraid
of
he
did
not
know
as
he
knelt
there
in
spirit
before
the
most
holy
sanctuary
in
the
world
the
sanctuary
of
chaste
and
beautiful
womanhood
many
evenings
they
met
together
in
the
same
way
they
became
more
intimate
more
friendly
and
norah
found
that
her
fear
of
dermod
was
gradually
passing
away
when
evenings
were
wet
they
sat
in
the
byre
or
where
the
fire
burned
brightly
and
talked
about
glenmornan
and
the
people
at
home
one
day
micky
s
jim
said
that
he
himself
had
once
a
notion
of
norah
ryan
when
dermod
heard
this
he
flushed
hotly
norah
s
cheeks
got
very
red
and
jim
laughed
loudly
i
have
no
time
for
them
sort
of
capers
now
said
jim
ye
can
have
her
all
to
yerself
dermod
and
people
like
yerselves
will
be
always
doin
the
silly
thing
indeed

will
chapter

a
game
of
cards
i
micky
s
jim
was
telling
the
story
of
a
fight
in
which
he
had
taken
part
and
how
he
knocked
down
a
man
twice
as
heavy
as
himself
with
one
on
the
jaw
owen
kelly
gourock
ellen
dermod
and
norah
were
the
listeners
the
squad
had
just
changed
quarters
from
a
farm
on
which
they
had
been
engaged
to
the
one
on
which
they
were
now
and
it
was
here
that
they
were
going
to
end
the
season
the
farm
belonged
to
a
surly
old
man
named
morrison
a
fellow
always
at
variance
with
the
squad
whom
he
did
not
like
jim
was
telling
the
story
in
the
a
blazing
fire
lit
up
the
place
shadows
danced
along
the
roof
outside
a
slight
rain
was
falling
and
the
wind
blew
mournfully
in
from
the
hayricks
that
stood
up
like
shrouded
ghosts
in
the
gloomy
stack
yard
presently
a
man
entered
a
fellow
with
a
limp
in
one
leg
and
a
heavy
stick
in
his
hand
he
was
a
stranger
to
norah
and
dermod
but
the
rest
of
the
squad
knew
him
well
and
were
pleased
to
see
the
man
with
the
limp
owen
kelly
however
grunted
something
on
seeing
the
stranger
and
a
look
certainly
not
of
pleasure
passed
across
his
face
how
are

micky

micky
s
jim
was
shouting
to
willie
the
duck
who
was
helping
to
turn
the
body
of
a
disused
cart
upside
down
aye
sure
said
willie
the
duck
but
as
he
spoke
he
fell
prostrate
on
his
face
causing
all
who
were
watching
him
to
burst
into
loud
peals
of
laughter
when
the
cart
was
laid
down
a
game
of
banker
commenced
and
most
of
the
squad
joined
in
the
game
dermod
flynn
watched
the
players
for
a
little
space
then
he
rose
to
his
feet
where
are
ye
goin
norah
asked
to
look
at
the
don
t
dermod
why
maybe
ye
ll
learn
to
and
if
i
do
there
was
a
note
of
defiance
in
the
boy
s
voice
and
it
was
evident
that
norah
s
remarks
had
displeased
him
well
do
as
you
like
said
the
girl
in
an
injured
tone
but
mind
that
it
s
a
sin
to
play
dermod
stretched
himself
laughed
and
approached
the
table
norah
felt
a
sudden
fear
overcome
her
she
wanted
him
back
and
she
was
angry
with
the
cards
little
squares
of
cardboard
that
could
lure
dermod
away
from
her
side
he
bent
over
the
shoulder
of
micky
s
jim
who
was
smoking
and
shouting
loudly
all
the
players
with
the
exception
of
ginger
dubbin
were
very
excited
ginger
hummed
tunes
with
equal
gusto
whether
winning
or
losing
most
of
the
players
used
pence
but
a
few
pieces
of
silver
glittered
on
the
table
and
micky
s
jim
had
changed
a
sovereign
dermod
had
never
gambled
although
he
had
often
played
cards
before
then
the
stakes
were
merely
buttons
that
was
not
gambling
no
one
feels
very
vexed
at
having
lost
a
button
something
thrilled
dermod
through
as
he
looked
at
the
coins
on
the
board
the
two
pieces
of
silver
attracted
him
strongly
he
had
one
hand
deep
in
his
trousers
pocket
closing
tightly
over
the
money
in
his
possession
how
exciting
it
would
be
to
put
something
on
that
card
he
was
certain
that
it
would
win
dubbin
turned
up
the
card
which
dermod
s
imagination
pictured
to
be
a
good
one
and
showed
an
ace
the
winning
card
if
only
he
had
staked
a
penny
on
it
dermod
thought
he
sat
down
beside
micky
s
jim
and
gazed
across
the
board
another
cut
for
me
he
said
and
his
voice
was
a
trifle
husky

of
and
was
employed
as
a
bank
clerk
in
paisley
it
was
now
saturday
he
always
returned
home
on
and
spent
sunday
on
his
father
s
farm
eamon
doherty
was
very
pleased
to
see
young
morrison
who
was
a
great
friend
of
his
and
sometimes
when
the
squad
went
home
at
the
end
of
the
year
eamon
stopped
with
morrison
senior
and
worked
over
the
winter
on
the
farm
the
squad
interested
young
morrison
these
strange
people
have
a
certain
fascination
for
me
he
told
his
friends
in
town
young
men
and
women
with
great
ideals
and
full
of
schemes
and
high
purposes
for
the
reformation
of
the
human
race
morrison
belonged
to
a
club
famous
for
its
erudite
members
one
of
whom
discovered
a
grammatical
error
in
a
translation
of
karl
marx
s
and
another
who
had
written
a
volume
of
verses
of
the
young
morrison
himself
was
a
thinker
a
moralist
earnest
and
profound
in
his
own
estimation
coming
into
contact
with
the
potato
diggers
on
he
often
wondered
why
these
people
were
treated
like
cattle
wherever
they
took
up
their
temporary
abode
here
on
his
father
s
farm
kindly
old
men
lithe
active
youths
and
pure
and
comely
girls
were
housed
like
beasts
of
burden
the
young
man
often
felt
so
sorry
for
them
that
he
almost
wept
for
his
own
tenderness
before
entering
the
shed
on
this
evening
he
had
looked
in
at
them
from
the
cover
of
the
darkness
outside
he
noticed
the
fire
shining
on
their
faces
saw
old
maire
a
glan
telling
her
beads
the
bent
over
the
cart
the
young
women
knitting
and
the
two
harridans
gourock
ellen
and
annie
holding
out
their
hacked
hands
to
the
blaze
the
gamblers
were
so
interested
in
their
game
that
they
took
very
little
notice
of
the
young
man
when
he
entered
the
shed
even
eamon
doherty
who
was
playing
had
scant
leisure
to
greet
the
morrison
sat
down
on
an
box
beside
gourock
ellen
who
was
stretching
out
her
lean
fingers
to
the
fire
ellen
he
cried
jovially
for
he
knew
the
woman
and
sitting
down
stretched
out
one
delicate
hand
on
the
middle
finger
of
which
a
ring
glittered
to
the
stove
it
may
be
a
guid
e
en
but
it
s
gey
cold
said
ellen
there
are
many
new
faces
here
said
morrison
looking
into
the
corner
where
norah
ryan
was
sitting
sewing
patches
on
her
working
dress
the
girl
was
deep
in
thought
why
has
dermod
gone
away
and
left
me
for
them
cards
she
asked
herself
and
for
a
while
sought
in
vain
for
an
answer
then
when
it
came
she
thrust
it
away
angrily
and
refused
to
give
it
credence
although
the
answer
came
from
the
depths
of
her
own
soul
he
cares
more
for
the
cards
than
he
cares
for
she
looked
up
and
saw
the
glint
of
the
fire
on
the
ring
which
the
visitor
wore
and
noticed
that
he
was
looking
at
her
she
had
not
noticed
the
man
before
never
had
such
a
person
visited
the
squad
it
s
alec
morrison
the
farmer
s
son
old
maire
a
glan
who
was
sitting
beside
the
girl
whispered
he
just
comes
in
here
like
one
of
ourselves
as
the
man
said
just
think
of
that
and
him
a
gentleman
norah
bowed
her
head
for
morrison
s
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
still
why
did
he
keep
staring
at
her
she
asked
herself
and
felt
very
uncomfortable
but
not
displeased
and
how
that
ring
sparkled
too
it
must
have
cost
a
great
amount
of
money
a
wave
of
tenderness
swept
across
morrison
as
he
looked
at
norah
she
s
too
good
for
this
sort
of
life
he
said
inwardly
as
he
noticed
her
white
brow
and
the
small
delicate
fingers
in
which
she
held
the
needle
it
s
criminal
to
condemn
a
girl
like
her
to
such
a
life
the
sanitary
authorities
will
not
give
my
father
permission
to
house
his
cattle
in
the
stall
where
that
girl
has
now
to
sleep
that
maiden
to
sleep
there
i
a
man
who
should
be
able
to
bear
suffering
and
privation
sleep
in
soft
clothes
that
are
clean
and
comfortable
and
she
has
to
lie
in
rags
in
straw
in
a
place
that
is
not
good
enough
for
cattle
and
all
these
people
are
like
myself
people
with
souls
feelings
and
passions
have
you
just
come
to
this
country
for
the
first
time
he
asked
norah
and
when
he
put
the
question
a
sense
of
shame
surged
through
him
the
first
time
answered
the
girl
and
you
ll
not
think
much
of
scotland
he
said
people
like
yerself
may
like
it
said
maire
a
glan
but
as
for
us
it
s
beyont
talkin
about
in
the
last
farm
we
had
to
sleep
in
a
shed
that
was
full
of
rats
they
ate
our
bits
of
food
aye
and
our
very
clothes
the
floor
was
alive
with
and
worms
the
night
before
we
left
the
shed
was
flooded
and
there
was
eighteen
inches
of
water
on
the
floor
we
had
to
rise
from
our
beds
in
the
bare
pelt
and
stand
all
night
up
to
our
knees
in
the
cold
water
there
s
norah
ryan
getting
red
in
the
face
as
if
it
was
her
very
own
norah
what
a
pretty
name
said
the
young
man
and
did
she
sleep
in
that
shed
the
farmers
think
that
we
re
pigs
said
maire
a
glan
harshly
that
s
why
they
treat
us
like
it
s
wrong
very
wrong
said
the
young
man
and
his
eyes
were
still
fixed
on
norah
the
girl
wondered
why
he
stared
at
her
in
such
a
manner
he
was
handsome
to
look
upon
and
she
had
never
spoken
to
such
a
man
in
all
her
life
before
but
she
felt
frightened
at
something
which
she
could
not
understand
and
wished
that
the
man
was
gone
an
idea
came
to
her
that
she
was
doing
something
very
wrong
and
with
this
idea
came
fear
fear
of
the
unknown
gourock
ellen
elbows
on
knees
her
hands
crossed
over
her
breast
and
her
thumbs
propping
her
chin
began
to
tell
a
story
of
one
of
her
early
love
affairs
how
a
man
would
not
pay
and
how
she
took
away
his
clothes
and
vowed
to
send
him
out
naked
into
the
streets
morrison
listened
attentively
and
norah
who
did
not
understand
the
story
fully
and
who
was
shocked
at
all
she
understood
wondered
why
the
farmer
s
son
was
not
horrified
at
this
episode
in
the
life
of
ellen
about
ten
o
clock
he
rose
to
go
and
stood
for
a
moment
talking
to
micky
s
jim
at
the
norah
examined
him
attentively
he
was
well
favoured
and
vigorous
and
he
spoke
so
nicely
and
quietly
too
dermod
flynn
is
makin
a
fortune
jim
was
saying
alec
morrison
went
to
the
door
there
he
stood
for
a
moment
and
looked
back
into
the
shed
norah
glanced
at
the
youth
their
eyes
met
and
both
felt
that
this
was
something
which
they
desired
morrison
s
simplicity
his
interest
in
the
squad
and
his
kindly
remarks
established
a
bond
of
sympathy
between
himself
and
norah
but
even
yet
she
could
not
understand
why
such
a
youth
had
visited
the
squalid
shed
in
which
the
squad
was
staying
he
seemed
out
of
place
he
could
not
feel
at
home
in
such
dirty
surroundings
and
he
had
gazed
so
earnestly
at
her
in
his
eyes
was
a
look
of
appeal
of
entreaty
it
seemed
to
norah
that
it
was
in
her
power
to
bestow
some
favour
on
the
youth
give
him
some
precious
gift
that
he
desired
very
earnestly
filled
with
a
mixed
emotion
of
pleasure
and
natural
modesty
the
girl
wondered
if
all
that
had
happened
was
real
and
if
it
had
any
significance
for
her
the
way
he
looked
at
me
she
murmured
in
a
puzzled
voice
and
him
a
gentleman
talking
to
us
as
if
we
were
of
his
own
kind
he
must
be
very
learned
and
why
didn
t
dermod
flynn
stay
with
me
here
not
runnin
away
to
them
old
cards
she
glanced
at
dermod
whose
face
was
flushed
and
whose
fingers
trembled
nervously
as
he
placed
a
silver
coin
down
on
the
and
instinctively
it
was
borne
to
her
that
something
black
and
ugly
had
crept
into
the
purity
of
the
passion
which
attracted
her
towards
the
glenmornan
youth
the
blame
s
all
on
me
she
whispered
hardly
realising
what
she
was
saying
and
began
to
turn
over
in
her
mind
every
incident
of
the
evening
from
the
time
when
she
first
noticed
alec
morrison
sitting
by
the
fire
up
till
the
present
moment
did
you
see
the
way
that
the
farmer
s
son
was
watchin
ye
norah
ryan
maire
a
glan
asked
his
two
eyes
were
on
ye
all
the
time
he
ll
be
havin
a
notion
of
that
he
will
said
gourock
ellen
and
both
women
laughed
loudly
and
maire
a
glan
the
decent
woman
says
that
norah
whispered
to
herself
and
blushed
and
them
laughin
as
if
there
was
nothing
wrong
in
it
then
there
s
no
harm
in
me
speakin
to
the
farmer
s
at
the
table
the
game
was
now
fast
and
furious
none
of
the
players
heard
the
women
s
remarks
chapter
xviii
in
the
lane
i
sunday
afternoon
of
a
week
later
alec
morrison
was
walking
along
a
sheltered
lane
towards
the
house
his
hands
deep
in
his
trousers
pockets
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
and
his
mind
dwelling
on
several
things
which
had
taken
place
the
week
before
on
sundays
he
liked
to
walk
alone
when
there
was
nothing
extraneous
to
distract
his
mind
and
then
to
ponder
over
thoughts
that
thronged
his
brain
from
time
to
time
he
was
a
progressive
and
the
term
which
might
mean
anything
to
the
general
public
to
morrison
meant
all
that
was
best
in
an
age
that
to
him
was
extremely
reactionary
and
lacking
in
earnestness
of
purpose
and
clarity
of
vision
the
young
man
believed
that
he
himself
realised
all
the
beauty
and
all
the
significance
of
life
and
the
importance
of
the
task
allocated
in
it
to
man
he
also
imagined
that
he
possessed
unlimited
powers
and
that
in
the
advance
of
humanity
towards
perfection
he
was
destined
to
play
an
important
part
most
young
men
of
sanguine
temperament
who
read
a
little
paint
a
little
and
write
a
little
have
at
times
hallucinations
of
this
kind
the
young
man
s
pet
idea
was
that
he
by
some
inscrutable
decree
of
fate
had
been
appointed
to
show
the
working
classes
the
road
towards
a
better
life
towards
enlightenment
and
prosperity
up
till
very
recently
he
was
now
he
had
taken
no
notice
of
the
great
class
to
which
he
did
not
belong
he
lived
in
society
was
cradled
in
its
smug
and
nourished
at
the
breasts
of
affectation
he
spent
many
years
at
school
and
now
realised
that
he
had
wasted
his
time
there
after
leaving
school
he
entered
a
bank
in
paisley
and
spent
a
number
of
hours
daily
bending
over
a
desk
copying
interminable
figures
with
a
weary
pen
seeing
the
conditions
under
which
labourers
wrought
on
his
father
s
farm
caused
him
to
think
seriously
once
when
he
was
at
home
two
persons
a
man
and
a
woman
donal
and
jean
supposed
to
be
husband
and
wife
got
employment
in
the
steading
these
two
people
were
very
ragged
very
dirty
and
very
dissolute
the
woman
s
face
was
hacked
in
a
terrible
manner
her
nose
had
been
broken
and
her
figure
looked
more
like
a
maltreated
animal
s
than
a
human
being
s
the
man
was
stunted
and
weedy
both
drew
their
wages
daily
and
got
drunk
every
night
one
night
when
they
had
returned
from
a
neighbouring
village
morrison
saw
them
in
their
sleeping
quarters
a
disused
no
longer
tenable
for
animals
was
handed
over
to
these
creatures
a
pile
of
dirty
straw
lay
on
the
floor
and
on
this
the
man
and
woman
were
sleeping
the
man
snoring
loudly
the
woman
lying
face
upwards
the
blunt
nails
of
her
bleeding
fingers
showed
over
the
filthy
bags
which
covered
her
body
a
guttering
candle
was
dying
in
the
neck
of
a
beside
them
and
the
smell
of
beer
pervaded
the
place
it
must
be
an
awful
life
this
he
said
to
his
father
who
accompanied
him
these
kind
of
people
think
nothin
of
it
his
father
said
they
get
drunk
every
night
and
are
very
happy
whisky
is
the
only
thing
they
yes
they
want
something
like
that
to
live
in
a
place
like
what
struck
the
young
man
forcibly
at
that
moment
was
that
the
people
were
like
himself
that
under
certain
conditions
he
might
be
just
as
they
were
even
like
the
man
lying
under
the
dirty
bag
by
the
side
of
the
pockmarked
harridan
and
that
man
under
favourable
conditions
might
be
himself
morrison
and
full
of
glorious
dreams
for
the
betterment
of
the
race
to
which
he
belonged
that
night
morrison
slept
little
and
when
sleep
came
he
dreamt
that
he
lay
with
the
old
harridan
under
the
dirty
coverlet
his
arms
round
her
and
his
lips
pressed
against
the
dry
and
almost
bloodless
lips
of
the
woman
in
the
morning
the
remembrance
of
the
dream
filled
him
with
horror
that
such
people
should
exist
that
under
certain
conditions
he
might
be
the
man
lying
there
in
the
he
began
to
think
seriously
of
things
then
he
came
across
a
woman
in
paisley
a
woman
who
belonged
to
the
club
of
which
he
was
a
member
a
woman
whom
he
thought
was
different
to
all
others
she
was
progressive
and
pronounced
in
her
views
and
explained
to
morrison
how
society
from
top
to
bottom
from
hall
to
hovel
from
robes
to
rags
was
an
expression
of
injustice
of
wrong
of
vice
of
filth
and
moral
decrepitude
and
that
in
the
interest
of
the
future
race
the
social
system
had
to
be
changed
and
society
to
be
renovated
because
she
was
very
clever
and
good
looking
morrison
fell
in
love
with
this
woman
she
was
a
typist
in
a
merchant
s
office
ii
thinking
of
many
things
he
sauntered
towards
the
farm
the
cigarette
went
out
he
threw
it
away
and
lit
another
the
evening
was
calm
and
quiet
a
few
late
birds
were
chirruping
in
the
hazel
bushes
and
somewhere
in
the
distance
a
dog
barked
loudly
the
grey
twilight
that
links
day
and
night
was
over
everything
suddenly
morrison
perceived
norah
ryan
coming
towards
him
she
wore
her
grey
tweed
which
showed
to
perfection
the
outlines
of
her
slender
figure
in
one
hand
she
carried
a
book
the
other
hand
hung
idly
by
her
side
are
you
going
for
a
walk
norah
ryan
morrison
asked
when
he
met
her
i
am
she
answered
hardly
knowing
whether
she
should
stop
and
talk
to
him
or
continue
on
her
way
you
re
reading
i
he
took
the
cigarette
from
his
mouth
as
he
spoke
held
it
between
finger
and
thumb
and
flicked
the
ash
off
with
his
little
finger
yes
i
m
readin
she
said
but
did
not
tell
him
what
book
she
held
in
her
hand
he
could
see
however
that
it
was
a
when
do
the
squad
go
to
ireland
next
friday
if
all
goes
well
she
answered
so
soon
morrison
exclaimed
and
in
his
voice
there
was
a
vague
hint
of
regret
are
you
glad
to
get
home
again
he
asked
and
the
rest
of
the
squad
what
are
they
doing
this
evening

they
playing
cards
the
men
are
the
women

the
farm
and
it
would
be
nice
to

his
company
she
had
seen
him
going
out
and
anticipated
meeting
him
coming
home
perhaps
that
was
why
she
had
come
if
so
she
did
not
dare
to
confess
it
even
to
herself
she
now
thought
that
she
should
not
have
come
a
tremor
shook
her
for
a
moment
then
she
turned
and
went
back
along
the
lane
with
the
young
man
a
car
drawn
by
a
white
pony
came
up
behind
them
and
they
stepped
nearer
to
the
line
of
hazel
bushes
to
let
it
pass
they
were
now
very
close
to
one
another
some
of
the
people
on
the
next
farm
coming
home
from
church
said
morrison
as
the
car
was
passing
watch
that
the
wheels
don
t
catch
you
the
lane
is
very
narrow
there
he
caught
hold
of
her
by
the
waist
drawing
her
close
to
him
and
pressing
her
very
tightly
the
car
was
almost
running
over
you
he
said
don
t
she
cried
striving
to
get
free
don
t
now
it
s
not
the
wheel
he
said
in
a
husky
voice
the
lane
is
so
he
knew
that
he
was
telling
a
lie
but
at
the
same
time
he
felt
very
pleased
with
himself
he
had
dropped
the
cigarette
which
could
be
seen
glowing
red
on
the
dark
ground
he
released
the
girl
but
would
have
liked
to
catch
her
in
his
arms
again
the
vehicle
went
rumbling
off
into
the
distance
it
is
so
very
dark
too
he
muttered
under
his
breath
they
walked
along
together
both
busy
with
their
own
thoughts
the
girl
hot
and
ashamed
but
curiously
elated
the
young
man
in
some
way
angry
with
himself
for
what
he
had
done
but
at
the
same
time
desirous
of
clasping
norah
again
in
his
arms
if
i
had
someone
to
tell
me
what
to
do
she
said
under
her
breath
but
knew
instinctively
that
there
was
no
one
but
herself
to
determine
what
action
should
be
pursued
in
an
event
like
this
even
if
advice
were
proffered
to
her
she
knew
that
it
would
be
useless
something
was
driving
her
to
the
brink
of
an
unknown
which
she
feared
and
from
which
there
was
no
retreat
and
no
escape
you
are
stumbling
said
morrison
and
again
caught
hold
of
her
she
had
not
stumbled
it
was
a
pretext
on
his
part
he
merely
wanted
an
excuse
to
hold
her
in
his
arms
she
could
see
his
hand
on
her
sleeve
and
noticed
the
gold
ring
sparkling
in
the
darkness
in
man
there
are
two
beings
the
corporal
and
the
spiritual
one
striving
after
that
happiness
which
ministers
to
the
passion
of
the
individual
to
the
detriment
of
the
race
the
other
which
seeks
for
happiness
according
to
divine
laws
a
happiness
that
is
good
for
all
yesterday
ten
minutes
before
this
spiritual
being
presided
over
morrison
s
destiny
now
as
he
walked
along
the
crooked
lane
a
lone
wind
sighing
in
the
hazel
bushes
and
a
few
stars
out
above
him
he
felt
the
animal
man
come
and
take
possession
of
him
the
rustling
of
norah
s
petticoats
as
she
walked
beside
him
the
slight
pressure
of
her
little
rough
fingers
on
his
large
smooth
hand
filled
him
with
an
insatiable
animal
desire
which
held
him
captive
this
was
no
new
experience
and
it
possessed
for
him
a
certain
charm
which
in
his
saner
moments
he
loathed
but
now
he
could
neither
conquer
nor
drive
it
away
i
like
the
bow
in
your
hair
he
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
that
startled
the
girl
it
suits
i
must
be
off
and
away
now
she
said
freeing
her
hand
from
his
but
not
drawing
it
away
quickly
enough
to
prevent
him
getting
possession
of
it
again
let
me
go
she
said
in
a
low
voice
ye
must
let
me
go
what
would
yerself
be
talkin
to
the
likes
of
me
for
there
s
the
farm
don
t
hurry
away
said
morrison
bending
down
and
placing
both
arms
round
her
waist
for
some
reason
which
he
could
not
fathom
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself
but
he
clasped
her
more
tightly
as
he
spoke
why
are
you
in
so
great
a
hurry
you
re
better
here
is
that
young
fellow
flynn
they
call
him
i
think
waiting
for
you
micky
s
jim
was
telling
me
he
had
no
right
to
said
the
girl
angrily
but
refrained
from
drawing
herself
away
dermod
flynn
is
nothin
to
i
m
glad
of
why
morrison
did
not
answer
it
would
be
unwise
to
commit
himself
in
any
way
he
thought
and
for
a
moment
he
mastered
the
passion
which
filled
his
body
the
lights
of
the
farm
sparkled
in
front
the
open
shed
was
facing
them
the
fire
glowed
red
inside
and
against
it
dark
forms
came
and
went
he
stooped
down
and
kissed
her
three
times
and
she
could
feel
his
warm
body
press
passionately
against
her
own
someone
passed
near
them
and
morrison
let
her
go
she
hurried
off
towards
the
shed
and
he
could
hear
the
patter
of
her
boots
as
she
ran
she
passed
dermod
flynn
on
her
way
no
doubt
he
had
seen
morrison
kiss
her
she
thought
when
she
entered
the
shed
gourock
ellen
who
was
bending
over
the
card
table
looked
up
and
saw
the
flush
of
colour
in
norah
s
face
then
ellen
noticed
dermod
coming
in
and
saw
the
troubled
look
in
the
boy
s
eyes
dermod
s
been
kissin
ye
lass
i
ll
warrant
she
whispered
to
norah
then
turning
round
to
micky
s
jim
she
opened
his
shirt
front
and
ran
her
fingers
down
his
hairy
chest
come
on
now
jim
for
that
ll
gie
ye
luck
she
cried
yes
decent
woman
it
s
sure
to
give
me
luck
said
jim
throwing
down
the
cards
and
putting
a
match
to
his
pipe
iii
what
have
i
done
what
s
alec
morrison
to
me
norah
asked
herself
as
she
looked
in
her
little
cracked
hand
mirror
ten
minutes
later
he
s
nothin
to
me
nothin
nothin
no
more
than
dermod
flynn
is
the
two
of
them
might
so
well
be
strangers
to
me
now
why
did
he
kiss
me
dermod
never
kissed
me
i
m
glad
of
norah
looked
round
the
byre
at
the
bunks
in
the
stalls
the
cattle
troughs
and
the
candle
burning
on
the
iron
stanchion
she
was
alone
the
other
women
were
still
out
with
the
in
the
shed
i
must
be
very
she
whispered
to
herself
as
her
eyes
sought
their
reflection
in
the
cracked
mirror
then
she
blushed
at
her
girlish
vanity
and
innocent
pride
and
him
so
grand
too
a
gentleman
but
in
some
indistinct
and
indefinite
way
she
felt
that
she
would
be
raised
to
his
level
and
he
kissed
me
she
put
her
fingers
over
her
red
lips
but
he
s
nothin
to
me
nothin
dermod
flynn
is
nothin
she
knew
that
the
first
assertion
was
not
true
the
repetition
of
the
second
gave
her
a
certain
pleasure
do
i
love
two
of
them
can
one
love
two
people
she
asked
herself
but
i
m
not
in
love
and
never
was
i
like
dermod
but
all
the
girls
in
the
squad
like
him
why
did
alec
morrison
kiss
me
and
him
a
gentleman
it
wasn
t
my
fault
was
it
she
looked
round
and
addressed
an
imaginary
person
a
look
of
bewilderment
settling
on
her
face
did
i
go
out
to
meet
him
this
evenin
did
i
like
his
kisses
is
dermod
flynn
angry
i
couldn
t
help
liking
dermod
he
is
so
good
so
kindly
but
i
m
a
bad
girl
very
bad
all
my
life
was
full
of
sin
pride
and
vanity
what
the
catechism
condemned
are
my
two
sins
i
used
to
be
vain
at
school
i
had
two
shoes
and
i
was
proud
because
other
people
wore
only
mairteens
i
used
to
dress
my
hair
and
try
and
look
nicer
than
any
other
girsha
because
i
was
vain
and
now
i
m
vain
because
a
gentleman
talks
kindly
to
me
god
forgive
me
ah
this
i
hate
it
i
ll
just
have
one
look
at
myself
and
then
never
get
hold
of
a
glass
she
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
her
fingers
toyed
with
the
potato
sacks
that
served
as
quilt
yes
he
s
very
nice
and
talks
to
us
so
kindly
she
whispered
and
again
her
eyes
sought
the
mirror
oh
it
was
a
fine
evening
one
of
the
nicest
ever
i
had
they
re
not
too
red
just
pale
and
when
the
blush
is
in
them
i
m
better
lookin
than
at
any
time
has
any
one
in
the
squad
cheeks
like
mine
why
did
he
want
to
kiss
me
and
my
boots
to
one
side
at
the
heels
and
the
risin
off
one
of
them
i
wish

of
it
gold
a
crock
of
gold
like
the
fairies

under
the
holly
bush

could
buy
new
dresses
and
maybe
rings
norah

far
over
your
forehead

doesn
t
become
ye
a
wee
bit
back

here
that

it
now

very
good
lookin
and
to
think
of
it
as
the
first
time
and
he
has
won
fifteen
shillin
s
said
maire
a
glan
who
had
just
entered
the
byre
fifteen
shillin
s
norah
what
he
won
who
who
but
dermod
flynn
said
the
old
woman
and
him
playin
for
the
first
time
chapter
xix
the
end
of
the
season
i
in
a
week
s
time
the
squad
was
to
break
up
gourock
ellen
annie
and
the
two
men
who
joined
at
greenock
were
leaving
for
glasgow
dermod
flynn
who
despite
the
initial
success
had
lost
all
his
money
at
the
was
going
to
remain
in
scotland
and
earn
his
living
at
the
first
job
that
came
to
hand
such
a
little
boy
norah
felt
sorry
for
him
but
now
he
hardly
deigned
to
look
at
her
when
at
work
the
look
was
always
in
his
eyes
and
at
night
he
played
for
hours
on
end
at
the
most
of
the
players
said
that
he
was
awfully
plucky
and
that
he
would
stake
his
last
penny
on
a
card
and
lose
the
coin
without
turning
a
hair
for
the
whole
week
prior
to
departure
norah
who
was
now
very
restless
laughed
nervously
when
a
joke
was
passed
but
seemingly
took
no
heed
of
the
joke
she
was
not
unhappy
but
in
a
dim
subconscious
way
felt
that
she
had
done
something
very
wrong
before
knowing
dermod
intimately
he
frightened
her
it
was
only
after
knowing
morrison
so
well
that
she
became
frightened
of
him
dermod
had
never
kissed
her
she
and
the
boy
were
only
friends
she
said
to
herself
time
and
again
dermod
was
only
a
friend
of
hers
nothing
more
sometimes
when
alone
she
said
so
aloud
as
if
trying
to
drown
the
inner
voice
that
told
her
it
was
not
true
if
dermod
only
ceased
playing
cards
things
might
right
themselves
she
thought
but
deep
down
in
her
heart
she
wished
everything
to
go
on
just
as
at
present
morrison
went
to
town
on
the
day
following
the
episode
in
the
lane
but
before
leaving
told
norah
that
he
would
come
back
to
see
her
prior
to
her
departure
for
ireland
don
t
tell
anybody
that
i
am
coming
back
he
said
and
while
wondering
at
his
words
she
promised
not
to
tell
the
squad
was
going
on
friday
on
thursday
night
morrison
returned
a
rose
in
his
buttonhole
and
a
stick
in
his
hand
she
saw
him
enter
the
farmhouse
as
she
returned
from
the
field
her
knees
sore
her
clothes
wet
and
straggling
locks
of
hair
falling
over
her
brow
at
supper
she
ate
little
but
took
great
care
over
her
toilet
scrubbed
her
hands
which
were
very
sore
until
they
bled
and
spent
nearly
half
an
hour
before
the
little
which
she
had
brought
from
ireland
she
sorted
her
tresses
and
put
in
its
place
an
erring
lock
that
persisted
in
falling
over
her
little
pink
ear
she
put
on
her
grey
dress
tied
a
glossy
leather
belt
around
her
waist
laced
her
shoes
and
when
she
had
finished
left
the
byre
which
was
lit
up
by
a
long
white
candle
stuck
in
the
neck
of
a
and
went
out
to
the
where
the
squad
assembled
morrison
was
there
before
her
sitting
beside
micky
s
jim
on
the
end
of
an
upturned
cart
and
speaking
to
maire
a
glan
about
the
hardships
of
the
field
willie
the
duck
played
his
fiddle
now
sadly
out
of
tune
a
game
of
cards
was
in
progress
and
dermod
flynn
who
held
the
bank
was
losing
rapidly
it
was
said
that
he
had
no
money
in
hand
except
the
wages
which
he
had
lifted
that
day
and
now
it
was
nearly
gone
what
would
he
do
when
all
was
spent
nobody
enquired
but
it
was
evident
that
he
would
not
return
to
ireland
that
winter
norah
entered
her
head
bent
down
a
little
her
hands
clasped
together
and
a
look
of
hesitation
on
her
face
ha
there
s
another
one
that
s
for
ireland
in
the
morning
said
micky
s
jim
taking
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
spitting
down
between
his
legs
to
the
floor
it
was
to
norah
that
he
spoke
and
dermod
flynn
ceased
playing
for
a
moment
to
glance
over
the
rim
of
his
cards
at
the
girl
but
his
mind
was
busy
with
something
else
and
his
eyes
turned
back
almost
instantly
to
the
he
cared
nothing
for
her
norah
thought
and
the
idea
gave
her
a
strange
comfort
you
re
going
as
well
as
the
rest
said
morrison
when
the
girl
drew
up
to
the
fire
he
knew
that
she
was
going
and
felt
that
he
should
have
said
something
else
presently
however
he
asked
are
you
glad
yes
she
answered
but
the
look
in
her
eyes
might
have
meant
morrison
understood
it
thus
and
the
sensation
which
surged
through
him
on
sunday
evening
surged
through
him
again
not
goin
to
play
any
more
skinned
out
someone
said
at
the
table
norah
glanced
at
the
players
and
saw
that
dermod
flynn
had
risen
he
approached
the
fire
one
hand
deep
in
his
pocket
the
other
holding
a
splinter
of
wood
which
he
threw
into
the
flames
he
had
lost
all
his
money
he
hadn
t
a
penny
in
the
world
now
gourock
ellen
offered
him
a
piece
of
silver
to
retrieve
his
fallen
fortunes
if
i
don
t
win
i
can
not
pay
you
back
he
said
and
sat
down
beside
morrison
and
facing
norah
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
fire
he
was
presently
buried
in
a
reverie
and
the
dreamy
look
of
the
schoolboy
was
again
on
his
face
one
of
his
hands
was
bleeding
it
had
been
torn
on
a
jagged
stave
which
got
loose
on
the
rim
of
norah
s
basket
earlier
in
the
day
his
knees
peeped
out
through
his
trousers
and
the
uppers
of
both
his
boots
had
risen
from
the
soles
norah
gazed
at
him
covertly
saw
the
wound
on
his
hand
the
bare
knees
showing
through
the
trousers
and
the
toes
peeping
through
the
torn
uppers
then
something
glistened
brightly
and
caught
her
eyes
it
was
the
ring
on
morrison
s
finger
the
young
man
was
speaking
and
it
will
be
ten
months
before
you
are
back
in
the
squad
again
such
a
long
time
it
s
not
much
comfort
we
have
in
this
country
anyway
said
maire
a
glan
who
was
turning
the
heel
of
a
stocking
stopping
for
a
moment
to
run
one
of
the
needles
through
her
hair
i
have
got
to
go
into
the
house
now
said
morrison
rising
to
his
feet
and
holding
out
a
hand
to
the
fire
i
hope
you
ll
all
have
a
good
voyage
across
the
lord
will
be
with
us
said
biddy
wor
who
had
just
come
in
from
the
byre
carrying
a
small
in
one
hand
and
a
pot
of
porridge
in
the
other
how
long
does
it
take
to
cross

biddy
wor
meanwhile
fixing
his
eyes
on
norah
ryan
derry

said
the
old
woman
we
always
say
derry
but
it
s
the
foreigner
bad
luck
be
with
him
that
put
london
on
to
it
from
greenock
it
takes
ten
hours
more
or
morrison
drew
a
cigarette
from
a
leather
case
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
as
he
was
lighting
the
cigarette
he
dropped
the
case
and
it
fell
beside
norah
s
feet
he
bent
down
hurriedly
come
out
into
the
open
for
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
he
whispered
in
a
low
voice
to
norah
as
he
stooped
then
he
went
out
taking
leave
of
the
party
in
one
and
five
minutes
later
norah
rose
from
her
seat
and
followed
him
where
are
ye
goin
girsha
asked
maire
a
glan
down
to
the
byre
said
the
girl
without
turning
round
morrison
was
standing
in
the
shadow
which
fringed
the
stretch
of
light
thrown
from
the
shade
is
that
you
norah
he
asked
knowing
well
that
it
was
she
and
as
he
spoke
he
took
her
into
his
arms
and
kissed
her
to
norah
there
was
something
dreadful
in
this
kiss
and
while
not
knowing
that
it
gave
expression
to
the
passion
of
the
man
she
felt
nervous
and
afraid
she
looked
back
to
the
shed
saw
the
faces
round
the
old
maire
knitting
in
the
corner
her
needles
showing
brightly
as
the
firelight
played
on
them
a
disused
hung
from
the
wall
she
had
never
noticed
it
before
here
in
the
dark
beyond
the
circle
of
light
something
terrible
threatened
her
something
that
she
could
not
comprehend
but
which
her
beating
heart
told
her
was
wrong
and
should
be
avoided
why
should
she
be
afraid
norah
had
all
the
boldness
of
innocence
her
virtue
was
not
armed
with
that
knowledge
which
makes
it
weigh
its
every
action
carefully
morrison
was
speaking
asking
her
to
come
further
out
into
the
darkness
but
she
still
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
shed
safety
lay
there
freedom
from
what
she
could
not
comprehend
the
man
had
hold
of
her
hands
pressing
them
tightly
entreating
her
to
do
something
she
freed
herself
from
his
grasp
and
ran
back
to
the
shed
half
glad
that
the
whole
incident
had
taken
place
and
more
than
a
little
desirous
to
go
out
again
her
love
for
the
youth
imparted
a
recklessness
to
her
timid
nature
when
she
went
to
her
sleeping
quarters
two
hours
later
old
maire
a
glan
accompanied
her
the
gamblers
were
still
playing
the
fire
blazed
merrily
and
ginger
dubbin
held
the
bank
and
was
winning
heavily
what
s
that
that
s
shinin
in
front
of
us
asked
maire
a
glan
as
she
came

how

i
to

said
norah
but
in
such
a
low
voice
that
the
old
woman
had
to
draw
near
to
catch
the
words
i
m
sleepy
she
said
after
a
pause
it
s
time
we
were
in
ii
on
the
morning
of
the
day
following
the
squad
prepared
for
their
departure
and
gathered
up
all
their
spare
clothes
their
pans
and
porringers
and
packed
them
in
woollen
handkerchiefs
and
tin
boxes
the

be
sent

knows
who

them
next
year
said
willie
the
duck
in
a
pathetic
voice
and
everybody
laughed
some
because
they
enjoyed
the
remark
and
others
because
it
was
the
correct
thing
to
laugh
at
every
word
uttered
by
willie
the
duck
dermod
flynn
watched
the
preparations
with
impassive
face
he
was
not
going
home
in
fact
he
had
not
as
much
money
in
his
possession
as
would
pay
the
railway
fare
to
the
nearest
town
all
his
wages
had
been
lost
on
the
he
had
nothing
now
to
rely
on
but
the
labour
of
his
own
hands
and
the
chance
of
getting
a
job
what

i
that

with

eamon
doherty
no

out
bare
naked
that

how

glenmornan
man

i
and
came
in
with
a
clowt
to
the
jowl
stop
yer
palaver
about
fightin
micky
s
jim
and
let
us
get
away
to
the
station
said
maire
a
glan
we
ll
not
auction
time
while
we
re
waitin
as
the
man
if
we
go
off
now
we
ll
only
have
three
hours
to
wait
for
the
train
remarked
jim
sarcastically
and
poor
dermod
flynn
said
maire
a
glan
tying
her
bundle
over
her
shoulders
with
a
string
not
a
penny
at
all
left
him
where
s
norah
ryan
she
s
the
girl
to
save
her
at
that
moment
norah
was
outside
with
morrison
and
the
young
man
was
asking
a
question
the
wish
to
find
an
answer
to
it
had
kept
him
awake
for
nearly
half
the
previous
night
why
did
you
run
away
from
me
yesterday
evening
norah
i
was
of
what
i
don
t
well
i
certainly
don
t
know
what
caused
you
to
run
morrison
knew
that
innocent
though
norah
was
some
subtle
instinct
warned
her
the
night
before
to
hurry
off
to
the
safety
of
the
shed
i
would
like
to
know
why
you
did
it
why
you
ran
away
i
mean
he
asked
knowing
in
his
own
heart
that
if
she
understood
she
had
good
reason
to
be
afraid
does
the
girl
understand
he
pondered
he
had
heard
them
talk
of
most
things
in
micky
s
jim
s
squad
but
perhaps
the
girl
paid
no
heed
to
the
talk
are
you
coming
back
next
year
he
enquired
it
s
more
nor
do
you
care
for
the
life
in
the
squad
it
could
be
that
s
no
recommendation
said
morrison
with
a
laugh
but
seeing
that
norah
failed
to
understand
him
he
went
on
i
don
t
think
you
could
have
a
life
much
harder
than
i
did
not
even
kiss
you
last
night
he
said
after
a
short
silence
and
now
you
are
going
away
and
maybe
never
coming
back
again
i
would
kiss
you
now
only
some
of
the
squad
might
see
us
and
you
wouldn
t
like
but
for
the
squad
morrison
cared
nothing
he
was
just
on
the
point
of
kissing
norah
when
he
noticed
his
father
looking
at
him
through
a
window
of
the
farmhouse
although
not
respecting
his
father
overmuch
for
old
morrison
was
a
and
man
the
son
did
not
want
the
little
love
affair
to
be
spoken
of
in
the
house
if
you
stay
in
greenock
norah
i
ll
go
down
with
you
said
the
young
fellow
will
you
stay
why
should
i
stay
asked
norah
who
did
not
understand
what
morrison
s
words
meant
because
well
you
see
stammered
the
youth
oh
i
think
you
d
better
go
with
the
rest
i
ll
see
you
next
he
held
out
his
hand
clasped
hers
almost
fiercely
and
without
another
word
turned
and
went
towards
the
house
on
the
way
he
lit
a
cigarette
rubbed
a
speck
of
dirt
from
the
knee
of
his
trousers
and
wondered
why
he
wanted
to
take
possession
of
the
innocent
girl
despite
his
views
on
the
equality
of
man
morrison
never
thought
of
marrying
norah
besides
there
was
ellen
keenans
the
advanced
woman
and
author
of
of
the
and
it
was
ellen
who
taught
him
what
man
s
conception
of
duty
towards
the
race
should
be
at
the
present
moment
morrison
did
not
see
how
he
could
fit
in
with
ellen
s
teachings
that
night
most
of
the
squad
sailed
for
ireland
gourock
ellen
and
annie
took
their
way
to
glasgow
and
dermod
flynn
set
out
on
the
open
road
ragged
penniless
and
alone
chapter

original
sin
i
a
year
had
passed
the
potato
season
was
over
but
old
morrison
who
was
making
considerable
improvements
in
his
steading
had
kept
the
squad
to
work
for
him
two
months
longer
than
usual
and
all
the
party
of
the
previous
year
with
the
exception
of
dermod
flynn
ellen
and
annie
was
there
nobody
in
the
squad
knew
where
dermod
had
gone
but
rumour
had
it
that
he
worked
during
the
previous
winter
as
a
farm
hand
on
a
farm
near
paisley
it
was
also
said
that
he
had
done
very
well
and
had
sent
ten
pounds
home
to
his
people
in
glenmornan
norah
ryan
had
spent
the
winter
and
spring
at
home
her
mother
was
still
alive
but
seldom
ventured
outside
the
door
of
the
cabin
the
coldness
of
the
dead
is
creeping
over
me
she
told
norah
when
the
girl
was
leaving
for
scotland
my
feet
are
like
lumps
of
ice
and
when
the
cold
reaches
my
heart
it
will
be
the
end
thanks
be
to
god
norah
felt
deeply
for
her
mother
the
old
woman
had
none
now
but
her
daughter
in
all
the
world
fergus
had
not
been
heard
of
for
the
last
three
years
some
said
that
the
boy
was
dead
others
that
he
was
alive
and
making
a
big
fortune
norah
always
prayed
for
him
nightly
when
she
went
down
on
her
knees
asking
the
virgin
to
send
him
safe
home
and
if
he
is
dead
to
intercede
with
her
son
for
the
repose
of
his
at
the
end
of
each
fortnight
the
girl
who
earned
twelve
shillings
weekly
sent
sixteen
home
to
her
mother
in
four
months
norah
sent
six
pounds
eight
shillings
to
frosses
and
a
pound
of
this
went
towards
the
expense
of
the
priest
s
mansion
the
same
amount
had
been
paid
the
year
before
and
norah
was
because
now
her
father
would
rest
easily
in
his
grave
he
ll
rest
in
peace
now
that
all
his
lawful
debts
are
paid
the
old
parish
priest
said
micky
s
jim
had
fallen
in
love
with
oiney
dinchy
s
daughter
and
it
was
said
that
he
was
going
to
get
married
to
her
when
he
went
back
to
ireland
owen
kelly
was
as
niggardly
as
ever
once
during
the
year
he
had
bought
a
pennyworth
of
milk
and
at
night
he
left
it
in
a
beside
his
bed
in
the
morning
the
milk
was
gone
and
owen
wept
so
micky
s
jim
said
and
jim
also
circulated
a
story
about
a
rat
that
drank
the
milk
from
the
bottle
but
that
couldn
t
be
as
the
man
but
it
could
be
i
saw
it
while
all
the
rest
of
ye
were
snorin
there
s
no
standin
your
lies
micky
s
true
as
death
twas
a
rat
that
drunk
the
milk
jim
explained
i
saw
it
meself
stuck
its
tail
down
the
neck
of
the
bottle
and
licked
its
tail
when
it
took
it
out
took
two
hours
to
drink
the
whole
lot
i
once
had
a
great
fight
and
all
about
a
bottle
of
milk
it
was
christmas
eve
norah
sat
beside
the
coal
fire
which
burned
in
the
large
stove
in
morrison
s
cart
shed
seeing
pictures
in
the
flames
outside
there
was
no
moon
but
a
million
stars
shone
in
a
heaven
that
was
coldly
clear
the
squad
was
going
home
i
haven
t
seen
that
fellow
young
morrison
for
a
whole
year
said
maire
a
glan
who
was
sewing
patches
on
her
dress
i

that
what

at

hundreds
of
other
things
that
the
very
priest
himself
wouldn
t
ask

s
a
good
youngster
for
all

remarked
owen
kelly
who
once
got
a
shilling
as
a
tip
from

young
fellow
that

no
reason
for
ye
takin

norah
ryan
started
forward
in

at
maire
a
glan
rose
and
went
outside
ii
she
had
not
seen
morrison
for
close
on

months
and
he

to
her
but
time
and
again
she
intended
to
post
one
of
the
letters
which
she
spent
part
of
her
time
in
writing
to
him
but
they
were
never
posted
and
often
she
wondered
why
she
had
written
them
why
he
wouldn
t
care
for
her
she
told
herself
many
times
he
was
far
above
her
a
gentleman
she
was
only
a
poor
worker
a
little
potato
gatherer
he
had
never
written
and
perhaps
he
did
not
love
her
one
little
bit
she
felt
angry
and
resentful
with
him
as
she
went
out
from
the
stuffy
shed
and
looked
up
at
the
starlit
sky
alec
morrison
was
waiting
norah
could
see
his
dark
form
showing
against
the
white
gable
of
the
byre
and
could
hear
the
crunch
of
his
boots
on
the
gravel
as
he
changed
his
position
he
had
just
come
from
glasgow
he
was
working
there
now
and
he
had
come
down
to
see
norah
before
she
went
back
to
ireland
he
had
often
intended
to
write
to
her
but
never
did
other
more
pressing
problems
relating
to
a
new
sweetheart
a
pretty
little
damsel
in
wonderful
dresses
and
with
no
more
morals
than
a
bird
took
up
his
attention
he
held
out
his
hand
to
norah
when
she
approached
i
m
glad
you
ve
come
out
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
ve
been
waiting
here
for
quite
a
long
he
had
been
waiting
for
her
norah
s
heart
gave
a
bound
of
gladness
but
you
never
wrote
to
me
she
said
reproachfully
you
didn
t
write
to
me
and
i
didn
t
know
your
that
was
really
why
he
hadn
t
written
how
strange
she
had
never
thought
of
that
and
ye
would
write
certainly
norah
he
said
he
had
not
let
her
hand
go
now
he
imprisoned
the
other
how
coarse
they
were
and
hard
from
her
season
s
work
the
hands
of
the
glasgow
girl
but
he
felt
that
he
was
doing
something
wrong
in
comparing
the
two
women
at
that
moment
do
you
mind
the
last
night
you
were
here
i
have
often
been
thinkin
of
that
night
said
norah
are
you
going
to
run
away
from
me
why
did
you
run
away
the
last
time
i
don
t
know
maybe
it
was
that
i
was
she
looked
back
at
the
shed
as
she
spoke
saw
old
maire
a
glan
bending
over
the
fire
willie
the
duck
playing
his
fiddle
could
hear
the
loud
laughter
of
micky
s
jim
norah
looked
up
at
the
face
of
the
man
beside
her
and
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
we
ll
go
along
the
lane
a
bit
he
said
they
went
together
hand
in
hand
along
the
gravel
pathway
overhead
the
stars
sparkled
the
trees
showing
thin
against
the
sky
waved
their
bare
arms
in
the
slight
breeze
and
moaned
plaintively
willie
the
duck
was
playing
way
down
upon
the
swanee
river
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
melody
drifted
in
from
a
great
distance
that
s
a
wonderful
melody
said
the
young
man
in
it
is
the
heart
and
soul
of
a
persecuted
he
had
heard
somebody
make
that
remark
in
the
club
and
it
appealed
to
him
the
girl
made
no
answer
to
his
words
they
stopped
as
if
by
mutual
consent
opposite
the
large
shed
in
the
stack
yard
it
s
very
cold
said
morrison
is
it
we
ll
go
in
here
said
the
young
man
he
pulled
the
gate
of
the
stack
yard
apart
and
went
in
norah
following
a
vague
sense
of
danger
of
some
impending
menace
suddenly
took
possession
of
the
girl
the
sight
of
the
fire
shining
would
be
comforting
but
she
could
not
see
the
shed
now
between
her
and
it
the
farmhouse
stood
up
white
and
lonesome
a
light
glimmered
for
a
moment
in
one
of
the
rooms
then
went
out
somewhere
near
a
dog
barked
loudly
another
joined
in
the
outcry
an
uneasy
bird
rose
from
the
copse
and
fluttered
off
into
the
night
they
entered
the
shed
inside
it
was
warm
and
quiet
and
the
scent
of
old
hay
pervaded
the
place
a
strange
fear
blending
in
some
measure
with
joy
came
over
norah
morrison
s
arms
were
round
her
and
she
felt
as
if
she
wanted
to
tell
him
some
great
secret
no
thought
of
danger
was
now
in
her
mind
the
problems
of
existence
had
never
given
her
a
moment
s
thought
all
things
were
to
her
a
matter
of
course
the
world
the
trees
the
flowers
and
stars
and
men
and
women
love
in
some
vague
way
she
knew
was
related
to
marriage
just
as
faith
had
some
relation
to
heaven
but
the
faith
in
god
which
was
hers
was
something
which
she
never
strove
to
analyse
and
the
love
for
the
young
man
filled
her
being
so
much
at
present
that
she
could
not
draw
herself
apart
from
it
and
consider
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
her
position
everything
was
so
peaceful
and
quiet
that
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
world
were
asleep
and
dreaming
some
words
hazy
as
the
remembrance
of
almost
forgotten
dreams
drifted
into
her
mind
they
were
words
once
spoken
by
sheila
carrol
at
the
hour
of
midnight
on
dooey
strand
when
the
earth
is
asleep
child
that
will
be
a
dangerous
hour
for
you
may
then
commit
the
mortal
sin
of
what
did
sheila
mean
when
she
spoke
like
that
why
was
she
thinking
of
those
words
now
norah
did
not
know
before
her
was
a
great
mystery
something
unexplainable
terrible
the
great
fundamental
truths
of
life
were
unknown
to
norah
no
one
had
ever
explained
to
her
why
she
was
and
how
she
had
come
into
being
she
walked
blindly
in
a
world
of
pitfalls
and
perils
unhelped
by
anyone
she
groped
futilely
in
the
dark
for
one
sure
resting
place
looked
for
one
illuminating
ray
of
certainty
to
light
up
her
path
at
that
moment
the
soul
within
the
fair
body
of
hers
warned
her
in
some
vague
way
of
the
danger
which
lay
before
her
you
may
commit
the
mortal
sin
of
what
did
those
words
mean
she
wanted
to
run
away
but
instead
she
clung
closer
to
the
man
she
could
feel
his
lips
hot
on
hers
and
his
breath
warm
on
her
cheek
iii
something
terrible
had
happened
the
maiden
s
purity
never
sullied
by
a
careless
thought
was
sullied
for
ever
to
the
girl
it
appeared
as
if
something
priceless
which
she
loved
and
treasured
had
suddenly
been
broken
to
pieces
morrison
stood
beside
her
his
hands
resting
on
her
shoulders
his
breath
short
and
husky
and
his
whole
appearance
became
suddenly
repulsive
to
the
girl
and
the
man
wanted
to
be
gone
from
her
side
he
had
desired
much
obtained
what
he
desired
but
was
now
far
from
satisfied
he
felt
in
some
vague
inexplicable
way
that
she
had
suddenly
become
distasteful
to
him
with
other
women
he
had
often
before
experienced
the
same
feeling
he
bent
over
the
girl
who
quivered
like
a
reed
under
his
hands
are
you
going
into
the
house
he
asked
he
almost
said
i
ll
go
in
myself
she
answered
in
a
low
voice
go
away
and
leave
me
go
away
are
you
angry
with
me
he
asked
he
was
now
ashamed
of
all
that
had
taken
place
ashamed
of
himself
and
ashamed
of
the
girl
in
some
subconscious
way
it
was
borne
to
him
that
the
girl
was
to
blame
he
thrust
the
thought
away
for
a
moment
but
when
it
returned
again
he
hugged
it
eagerly
he
wanted
to
believe
it
he
chose
to
believe
it
norah
i
ll
see
you
again
before
you
go
he
released
her
arms
and
went
out
through
the
gateway
she
could
hear
his
footsteps
for
a
long
while
but
never
looked
after
him
a
great
fear
settled
on
her
heart
she
was
suddenly
conscious
of
having
done
something
terribly
wrong
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
very
fabric
of
her
life
had
been
torn
to
shreds
weeping
she
stole
back
to
the
shed
like
a
frightened
child
the
party
was
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
a
rat
chased
by
some
prowling
dog
had
just
run
into
the
shed
and
passed
between
the
legs
of
maire
a
glan
who
was
warming
her
hands
at
the
fire

lean
arm

she
spoke

caught

the
starlight
to
her
bed
her
mind
groping
blindly
with
a
terrible
mystery
which
she
could
not
fathom
chapter

the
cold

glenmornan
people

a
long
while
that

son
thady
and
he
s
a
dock
labourer
on
the
quay

said
that
poor

the
night
on
dooey
head
long
ago

and
bitter
times
he
said
that
father
devaney
has
furnished
his
new
house
and
the
cost
of
it
was
thousands
of
pounds
a
big
lot
for
a
poor
parish
to
pay
he
also
told
me
that
you
were
over
with
the
potato
squad
in
scotland
and
that
you
were
looked
on
with
no
unkindly
eyes
by
a
rich
farmer
s
son
but
whoever
he
is
or
whatever
he
is
you
are
too
good
for
him
for
it
is
yourself

was
always
the
comely
girl
with
the
pleasant
ways
whatever
you
do
child

for
the
men

a
long
time
he

long
letter
when

one
and
if
ever

couple
of
days

hoping
that

and
your
mother

in
good
health
sheila
who
would
that
letter
be
from
asked
mary
ryan
from
her
seat
in
the
chimney
corner
a
pile
of
dead
ashes
lay
on
the
hearth
the
previous
summer
had
been
wet
and
the
turf
was
not
lifted
from
the
bog
it
s
from
sheila
carrol
from
that
woman
child
and
what
would
she
be
writing
to
you
for
norah
she
s
dying
to
hear
from
the
frosses
people
answered
the
girl
and
it
is
very
lonely
away
in
the
big
lonely
exclaimed
the
mother
if
she
is
lonely
it
s
her
own
fault
it
s
the
hand
of
god
that
s
heavy
on
her
because
of
her
that
s
no
reason
why
the
tongue
of
her
country
people
should
be
bitter
against
saying
that
child
cried
the
woman
what
s
comin
over
you
at
all
girsha
never
let
me
hear
of
you
writing
to
that
woman
norah
went
to
the
door
and
looked
at
the
calm
sea
stretching
out
far
below
the
waves
were
bright
under
the
glance
of
the
sun
a
dark
boat
a
little
speck
in
the
distance
was
moving
out
towards
the
bar
where
are
you
going
norah
asked
the
woman
at
the
fire
down
to
the
sea
mother
answered
the
girl
as
she
made
her
way
towards
the
beach
ii
between
the
ragged
rocks
the
grass
was
soft
to
the
feet
and
refreshing
to
the
eyes
two
lone
sycamore
trees
showed
green
against
the
sky
a
few
stray
leaves
shrivelled
and
filed
through
by
caterpillars
were
fluttering
to
the
earth
a
long
stalk
partly
despoiled
by
some
heedless
child
but
still
bearing
three
beautiful
bells
at
the
extreme
top
whipped
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
wind
and
norah
reaching
forward
pulled
off
one
of
the
flowers
and
pinned
it
to
her
breast
the
tide
was
on
the
turn
the
girl
sat
on
a
rock
by
the
shore
and
put
her
small
brown
feet
in
the
water
down
under
the
moving
waves
they
looked
as
if
they
didn
t
belong
to
her
at
all
here
it
was
very
quiet
the
universal
silence
magnified
the
tranquillity
of
things
under
the
girl
s
feet
it
was
very
deep
very
dark
and
very
peaceful
there
where
a
reflected
swallow
swept
through
a
wide
expanse
of
mirrored
blue
in
the
sea
under
her
were
no
regrets
no
and
no
sorrow
when
the
tide
went
out
a
fair
young
body
a
white
face
with
closed
eyes
would
lie
on
the
strand
then
the
frosses
people
would
know
why
the
terrible
phantom
death
was
courted
by
a
girl
it
was
all
a
great
mistake
she
said
to
herself
and
in
the
excitement
caused
by
the
stress
of
thought
she
sank
her
nails
into
her
palms
the
memory
of
a
night
passed
seven
months
before
came
vividly
to
her
mind
how
many
tearful
nights
had
gone
by
since
then
how
many
times
had
she
written
to
alec
morrison
telling
him
of
her
plight
no
answer
had
come
the
man
was
indifferent
i
wasn
t
the
girl
for
the
likes
of
him
anyway
said
norah
looking
at
her
feet
in
the
water
but
why
has
all
this
happened
to
me
as
in
all
great
crises
of
a
person
s
life
there
came
a
moment
of
vivid
consciousness
to
norah
and
every
surrounding
object
stamped
itself
indelibly
on
her
mind
the
tide
was
sweeping
slowly
out
the
seaweed
in
the
pool
beneath
swayed
like
the
hair
of
a
dead
body
floating
in
the
water
two
little
fish
with
eyes
looked
up
and
seemed
to
be
staring
at
her
beneath
in
the
water
the
fleecy
clouds
looked
like
little
white
spots
against
the
blue
of
the
mirrored
sky
and
the
bar
moaned
loudly
on
the
frontier
of
the
deep
sea
no
matter
what
i
do
now
no
one
will
think
me
worse
than
i
am
said
the
poor
girl
i
ll
have
no
joy
no
more
in
my
life
for
there
s
no
happiness
that
i
can
look
forward
she
pulled
the
fairy
thimbles
from
her
breast
and
crushed
them
in
her
hand
out
near
the
bar
she
could
see
the
little
black
boat
heaving
on
the
waves
norah
rose
to
her
feet
how
dark
the
water
looked
under
her
the
sand
sloped
sharply
from
her
feet
to
the
bottom
of
the
pool
which
was
bedded
with
sharp
rocks
covered
with
trailing
slimy
seaweed
she
peered
in
catching
her
breath
sharply
as
she
did
so
then
one
little
brown
foot
went
further
into
the
water
afterwards
the
other
she
bent
down
cut
the
water
apart
with
her
hands
a
slight
ripple
spread
out
on
both
sides
and
was
lost
almost
as
soon
as
it
was
formed
jesus
mary
and
joseph
pray
for
me
a
sinner
now
and
at
the
hour
of
my
death
amen
she
said
repeating
a
prayer
which
had
flowed
countless
times
since
childhood
from
her
lips
a
sudden
thought
struck
her
and
a
look
of
perplexity
overspread
her
face
this
is
pilin
one
sin
on
top
of
the
other
she
said
in
a
low
voice
and
looked
round
fearing
that
somebody
had
overheard
her
everything
about
was
silent
as
if
in
fear
in
that
moment
she
thought
that
the
sea
had
ceased
to
move
the
swallow
to
circle
herself
even
to
live
the
world
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
something
an
event
of
great
and
terrible
purport
hidden
and
unknown
suddenly
the
child
that
was
in
her
leapt
under
her
heart
and
a
keen
but
not
unpleasant
pain
swept
through
her
body
she
drew
back
from
the
pool
at
the
thing
which
she
intended
to
do
i
ll
go
home
she
said
meekly
as
if
obeying
some
command
maybe
he
ll
have
pity
on
me
when
i
go
over
again
beyond
the
water
this
day
week

then
atall
atall
chapter
xxii
on
the
road
i
a
dead
weight
lay
on
norah
s
heart
the
child
beneath
her
heart
was
a
burden
but
even
yet
it
was
now
the
month
of
august
those
in
micky
s
jim
s
squad
did
not
suspect
her
condition
she
knew
however
that
she
could
not
conceal
her
plight
much
longer
and
she
wanted
to
run
away
and
hide
how
could
she
endure
the
glance
of
her
country
people
of
micky
s
jim
and
maire
a
glan
when
the
truth
became
known
the
squad
would
soon
set
off
to
morrison
s
things
would
go
well
if
once
she
got
there
she
assured
herself
at
present
she
wished
that
she
had
someone
to
confide
in
somebody
to
whom
she
could
tell
her
story
but
in
the
squad
there
was
none
whom
she
could
take
into
her
confidence
the
old
women
from
glenmornan
and
frosses
brimful
of
a
narrow
virtuous
simplicity
were
not
the
ones
to
sympathise
with
her
they
would
only
condemn
if
gourock
ellen
was
here
norah
felt
that
she
could
sigh
her
misfortune
into
that
woman
s
heart
but
neither
gourock
ellen
nor
annie
had
turned
up
for
the
last
two
years
and
nobody
knew
what
had
become
of
them
one
day
norah
felt
that
her
secret
was
discovered
no
one
spoke
of
it
no
one
hinted
at
her
condition
but
all
at
once
a
curious
feeling
of
restraint
of
suspicion
charged
the
atmosphere
of
the
barn
and
potato
field
whenever
she
asked
a
question
those
to
whom
she
spoke
fixed
on
her
a
stare
of
pity
not
pity
in
essence
but
in
design
before
replying
once
or
twice
when
ploughing
through
the
fields
her
head
bent
upon
her
work
she
glanced
round
covertly
to
see
the
eyes
of
everybody
in
the
squad
fixed
on
her
no
one
spoke
and
all
silently
resumed
their
work
when
she
looked
at
them
the
silence
terrified
and
crushed
the
girl
how
much
do
they
know
she
asked
herself
that
afternoon
as
she
ploughed
her
way
through
the
wet
fields
micky
s
jim
came
up
and
stood
behind
her
instinctively
she
knew
that
he
was
going
to
speak
and
she
waited
his
words
in
fear
and
trembling
norah
ryan
he
said
and
his
words
came
out
very
slowly
who
is
to
blame
is
it
jim
bent
down
lifted
a
potato
which
she
had
passed
over
threw
it
into
the
barrel
and
left
the
sentence
unfinished
it
was
friday
the
day
on
which
the
weekly
wages
of
the
party
were
paid
that
night
when
norah
received
her
money
she
stole
away
from
the
squad
intending
to
call
on
alec
morrison
ii
it
was
the
last
day
of
august
the
swallows
and
swifts
circled
above
norah
s
head
and
from
time
to
time
swept
down
over
the
sodden
pastures
where
the
farm
cattle
were
grazing
the
birds
snapped
greedily
at
the
awkward
that
were
now
rising
on
their
great
september
flights
morrison
s
farm
was
twenty
miles
distant
and
not
wanting
to
spend
the
money
which
she
had
earned
at
her
work
norah
travelled
all
night
long
in
the
morning
she
found
that
she
had
lost
her
way
and
had
to
retrace
her
steps
for
full
seven
miles
in
order
to
regain
her
former
course
at
a
wayside
she
sent
half
the
money
in
her
possession
home
to
her
mother
late
in
the
evening
feeling
footsore
and
very
weary
she
came
to
the
farm
although
she
had
not
eaten
food
since
leaving
the
squad
she
did
not
feel
in
the
least
hungry
now
and
again
dizziness
seized
her
however
and
a
sharp
pain
kept
tapping
as
if
with
a
hammer
in
her
head
everything
will
be
all
right
now
she
said
as
she
saw
the
lights
of
the
farm
glowing
through
the
haze
of
the
evening
but
for
all
that
she
said
the
grave
doubts
which
weighed
upon
her
could
not
be
shaken
away
she
entered
the
farmyard
a
few
stars
were
out
in
the
sky
a
low
wind
swept
round
the
hayrick
and
the
scent
of
hay
filled
her
nostrils
alec
would
surely
be
at
home
she
uttered
the
word
alec
aloud
she
had
never
given
it
utterance
in
his
presence
she
recollected
and
wondered
why
she
thought
of
that
now
the
windows
of
the
house
were
lighted
up
and
a
long
stream
of
light
quivered
out
into
the
darkness
norah
approached
the
door
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
shiny
brass
knocker
but
refrained
from
lifting
it
she
was
very
frightened
the
heart
within
her
fluttered
like
a
little
bird
that
struggles
violently
against
the
bars
of
the
cage
in
which
it
is
imprisoned
one
frail
white
hand
was
slowly
lifted
to
the
knocker
between
the
girl
s
fingers
it
felt
very
cold
and
she
let
it
go
without
moving
it
a
great
weariness
had
gripped
her
limbs
and
her
hand
heavy
and
dead
seemed
as
if
it
did
not
belong
to
her
she
came
away
from
the
door
and
approached
the
window
she
could
hear
loud
laughter
from
the
inside
and
somebody
was
playing
on
the
piano
a
dark
blind
hid
the
interior
of
the
room
from
her
view
but
the
light
streaming
out
showed
where
the
blind
had
been
displaced
at
one
corner
and
pressing
her
brow
against
the
pane
norah
looked
in
the
piano
suddenly
ceased
a
frail
shadow
came
between
the
light
and
the
window
then
a
young
and
beautiful
girl
passed
like
a
vision
across
the
stretch
of
room
open
to
the
watcher
s
eyes
norah
s
glance
took
in
the
girl
for
a
moment
she
noticed
a
fair
head
firmly
poised
a
small
hand
raised
to
brush
back
the
tresses
that
fell
down
over
a
white
brow
even
as
the
small
hand
was
raised
a
hand
larger
but
almost
as
white
reached
out
and
the
fingers
of
the
girl
were
gripped
in
a
firm
embrace
norah
started
violently
hitting
her
head
sharply
against
the
and
with
difficulty
restraining
the
cry
that
rose
to
her
lips
the
hand
white
as
a
woman
s
almost
with
the
glittering
ring
on
the
middle
finger
how
well
she
knew
it
and
who
was
the
fair
girl
the
fleeting
and
beautiful
vision
on
whom
she
looked
in
from
the
cold
and
darkness
of
the
night
norah
did
not
know
but
instinctively
she
felt
rising
in
her
heart
a
great
resentment
against
the
woman
in
the
room
hatred
filled
her
soul
her
breath
came
sharply
through
her
nostrils
and
a
mist
gathered
before
her
eyes
i
m
not
goin
to
cry
she
said
defiantly
and
began
to
weep
silently
even
as
she
spoke
a
withered
husk
of
moon
crept
up
the
sky
a
dying
wind
moaned
feebly
on
the
roof
overhead
and
on
the
ground
beneath
the
girl
s
feet
a
blundering
moth
struck
sharply
against
her
face
fell
to
the
ground
rose
slowly
and
as
slowly
disappeared
all
around
was
the
vast
breathing
silence
of
the
infinite
the
mystery
of
the
world
norah
looked
into
the
room
again
and
old
farmer
morrison
was
facing
her
a
long
white
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
a
starched
collar
under
his
chin
a
broad
grin
overspread
his
face
and
he
looked
like
a
fat
serious
frog
that
had
suddenly
begun
to
smile
the
upturned
end
of
the
blind
slowly
fluttered
down
and
the
whole
interior
of
the
room
was
hidden
from
the
girl
s
eyes
here
am
i
out
in
the
cold
and
everyone
is
happy
inside
said
the
poor
girl
pressing
her
hand
tightly
against
her
breast
as
she
spoke
what
was
i
doin
atall
atall
when
i
was
here
before
how
i
call
to
mind
that
night
of
all
nights
a
dear
night
to
me
and
it
is
forever
written
red
in
my
soul
there
he
s
in
there
and
in
there
is
another
girl
not
me
i
m
out
here
in
the
cold
mother
of
god
what
am
i
to
do
norah
went
back
from
the
window
caring
nothing
for
the
noise
she
made
caring
little
for
what
might
now
happen
to
her
her
face
twitched
her
breath
stressed
through
her
nostrils
her
shoulders
rose
slowly
and
fell
rapidly
the
breeze
gathered
strength
it
swept
as
if
in
a
light
passion
around
the
farmyard
and
caused
the
girl
s
skirts
to
cling
closely
about
her
legs
she
leant
for
support
against
the
shed
in
which
micky
s
jim
and
his
squad
had
taken
up
their
quarters
so
often
how
bare
and
lonely
the
place
looked
now
somewhere
in
the
far
corner
a
rat
was
gnawing
at
the
woodwork
with
its
sharp
teeth
presently
it
ran
out
into
the
open
moving
along
rapidly
but
as
softly
as
a
piece
of
velvet
trailed
on
polished
wood
at
that
moment
an
intense
and
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
took
place
within
norah
she
was
filled
with
a
strange
dislike
for
everything
and
everybody
a
great
change
began
to
operate
in
her
soul
in
one
vivid
flash
the
whole
world
lay
as
if
naked
before
her
man
lived
for
pleasure
only
he
had
no
thought
for
others
he
cared
only
for
himself
his
passions
and
desires
what
had
she
been
doing
all
her
life
working
for
others
slaving
that
others
might
be
happy
she
worked
to
bring
money
to
the
landlord
ah
the
dresses
that
the
landlord
s
daughters
wore
to
farley
mckeown
ah
the
lady
that
got
sixty
thousand
pounds
to
become
his
wife
and
to
the
priest
ah
the
big
mansion
and
the
many
rooms
at
this
awful
moment
she
dared
not
go
to
one
of
her
people
for
help
even
her
mother
would
give
her
the
cold
glance
if
she
went
home
she
might
shut
the
very
door
in
her
daughter
s
face
there
was
nobody
to
care
for
her
but
even
at
that
moment
she
recollected
gourock
ellen
and
sheila
carrol
and
felt
that
in
these
two
women
great
wells
of
sympathy
were
open
and
at
these
she
might
refresh
her
weary
soul
before
her
for
an
instant
the
world
lay
exposed
to
its
very
core
then
as
if
by
a
falling
curtain
the
sight
was
hidden
again
from
her
eyes
and
she
found
herself
a
lonely
little
girl
leaning
against
the
cold
wall
her
head
sunk
on
her
breast
and
her
numb
fingers
that
almost
lacked
feeling
pressing
against
the
rough
masonry
of
the
shed
a
great
wave
of
surged
through
the
girl
and
she
burst
into
tears
she
took
no
heed
of
the
voice
near
her
did
not
see
the
dark
forms
which
stood
beside
her
and
only
started
violently
and
looked
round
when
a
hand
was
laid
upon
her
shoulder
two
persons
a
man
and
a
woman
were
looking
at
her
but
even
then
in
the
terrible
isolation
of
her
own
thoughts
she
took
little
heed
of
the
strangers
she
gazed
at
them
vacantly
for
a
moment
then
turned
towards
the
wall
again
as
if
nothing
interested
her
but
the
bleak
shed
and
the
rats
squeaking
in
the
corner
when
after
a
moment
the
strange
woman
ventured
to
speak
norah
looked
round
in
surprise
she
had
forgotten
all
about
the
two
people
recollection
of
having
seen
them
before
came
to
her
they
were
the
man
and
woman
that
had
made
such
an
impression
on
morrison
when
he
viewed
them
sleeping
in
the
what
s
wrong
with
ye
asked
the
woman
in
a
not
unkindly
voice
norah
could
detect
the
odour
of
whisky
in
her
breath
and
concluded
that
both
the
man
and
woman
were
drunk
poor
girl
said
the
man
when
norah
did
not
answer
he
looked
closely
at
her
and
seemed
to
understand
her
plight
poor
lassie
he
repeated
where
s
yer
folk
ah
i
know
who
ye
are
for
i
saw

before
ye
were
here
with
the
tattie
diggers
last
year
weren

ye
come
doon
to
the
shed
with
us
said
the
woman
it
s
warmer
there
than
the
woman
took
the
girl
gently
but
firmly
by
the
hand
and
led
her
into
the
sty
in
which
herself
and
the
man
lived
norah
made
no
protest
and
followed
the
woman
without
a
word
in
the
of
the
man
and
woman
it
was
very
dark
and
rats
were
scampering
all
over
the
place
jean
said
the
man
on
hearing
the
scurrying
in
the
corner
rats
last
night
they
ate
all
our
food
said
the
woman
last
night
jean
interrogated
the
man
the
night
before
the
woman
corrected
the
man
drew
a
match
from
his
pocket
rubbed
it
on
his
trousers
and
lit
a
candle
stuck
in
the
neck
of
a
black
bottle
which
stood
on
the
floor
near
it
a
small
pile
of
wood
hemmed
with
a
few
lumps
of
coal
was
ready
for
lighting
to
this
the
man
applied
the
match
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
fire
was
burning
brightly
a
dark
smoke
rose
to
the
roof
which
was
broken
in
several
places
something
small
like
a
bird
fluttered
out
from
the
rafters
and
whirred
in
the
air
above
jean
said
the
man
a
blind
bat
sit
doon
here
lass
said
the
woman
drawing
forward
a
splintered
chest
and
placing
it
beside
norah

sitting

looking
at

and
pointing
to
a

which
lay
on

beside
him
the
woman
went
out
and
returned
in
a
few
minutes
with
a
porringer
of

she
handed

paused
for
a
moment
and
bit
the
nail
of
his
thumb
like
blazes
he
concluded
norah
looked
round
and
took
a
sudden
interest
in
the
place
an
instinctive
liking
for
this
man
and
woman
crept
into
her
soul
true
they
were
both
and
the
man
now
and
again
without
any
apparent
reason
uttered
words
which
were
not
nice
to
hear
yer
wife

a
kindly
woman
said
norah
breaking
through
the
barriers
of
her
silence

the
man
and
laughed
a
trifle
awkwardly
wife
well
i
suppose
it
is
all
the
the
man
was
a
stunted
little
fellow
unshaven
and
ragged
but
his
shoulders
were
very
broad
the
little
finger
of
his
left
hand
was
missing
and
his
toes
peeped
out
through
his
boots
his
teeth
were
stained
a
dirty
yellow
with
tobacco
juice
it
s
not
much
of
a
place
this
he
said
we
never
have
much
company
here
cept
the
bat
that
lives
in
the
rafters
and
the
wind
that
comes
in
by
the
door
and
the
stars
that
look
down
through
the
he
laughed
loudly
but
seeing
that
norah
did
not
join
in
his
laughter
he
suddenly
became
silent
norah
s
eyes
again
roved
round
the
place
it
was
dirty
and
squalid
well
in
keeping
with
the
occupants
a
potato
barrel
stood
in
one
corner
beside
it
was
a
pile
of
straw
covered
with
a
few
dirty
bags
this
was
the
bed
the
guttering
candle
gleamed
feebly
in
the
corner
and
the
grease
ran
down
the
bottle
overhead
the
bat
was
still
fluttering
madly
hitting
against
the
joists
every
moment
the
woman
the
shed
and
placed
the
porringer
of
water
on
the
fire

from

of

with

and
laid
it
on

minutes

warm

bottom
of
a
large
wooden
pail

at

straight
in
the

and
he
felt
that
she
was
seeing
through

into
a
world

beyond

the

the

he
threw
another
lump
of
coal
into

said
norah
then
stopped
and
left
the
words
that
rose
to
her
tongue
unuttered
sleep
was
stealing
over
her
she
shut
her
eyes
a
gentle
arm
was
laid
on
her
shoulders
she
rose
because
a
voice
suggested
that
she
should
rise
and
afterwards
found
herself
lying
on
the
bed
of
straw
a
vision
of
a
lighted
window
came
to
her
she
was
looking
in
at
the
man
she
loved
and
his
lips
were
pressing
those
of
another
woman
then
scenes
and
objects
vague
and
indistinct
passed
before
her
eyes
big
dark
shadows
mustered
together
in
the
centre
of
the
roof
above
her
then
other
shadows
from
all
sides
rushed
in
and
joined
together

and
became
blended
in
complete
obscurity

complications
i
on
the
night
of
norah
s
arrival
at
the
steading
alec
morrison
slept
well
but
wakened
with
the
dawn
and
sat
up
betimes
he
was
very
pleased
with
himself
and
his
position
at
the
bank
things
had
gone
well
his
father
had
doubled
his
allowance
and
on
the
strength
of
that
the
young
man
had
become
engaged
he
had
broken
with
the
little
girl
in
glasgow
for
while
admiring
her
good
looks
he
deplored
her
lack
of
intelligence
she
spent
a
great
deal
of
her
time
in
dressing
herself
and
morrison
knew
that
there
would
come
a
day
when
dresses
would
not
please
when
a
husband
would
require
something
more
worthy
of
respect
something
more
enduring
than
pretty
looks
and
gaudy
garments
besides
this
drawback
there
was
another
the
girl
who
took
her
good
looks
from
her
mother
long
dead
had
a
grasping
greedy
father
whom
nobody
could
love
or
admire
morrison
had
met
him
twice
and
disliked
him
immensely
he
was
a
dirty
little
man
and
generally
had
three
days
growth
of
hair
on
his
chin
when
shaking
hands
his
thumb
described
a
curious
backward
turn
forming
into
a
loop
like
one
of
those
on
the
letter
the
daughter
had
the
same
peculiarity
before
meeting
the
father
this
movement
of
the
girl
s
thumb
amused
morrison
afterwards
it
disgusted
him
finally
he
took
his
departure
and
again
got
into
tow
with
ellen
keenans
the
live
woman
with
advanced
views
ten
years
ahead
of
her
age
morrison
fell
in
love
easily
indifferently
almost
he
was
an
attractive
young
man
well
built
and
muscular
who
cultivated
the
art
of
dress
with
considerable
care
all
women
fascinated
him
but
none
held
him
captive
for
very
long
he
had
become
engaged
to
the
girl
with
the
advanced
ideas
and
took
her
to
his
people
s
home
the
old
farmer
liked
her
but
did
not
understand
many
of
the
things
of
which
she
spoke
that
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
seeing
that
he
was
a
plain
blunt
man
although
a
gentleman
farmer
and
the
girl
was
ten
years
ahead
of
her
time
ii
alec
morrison
the
sleep
gone
entirely
from
his
eyes
his
face
a
little
red
after
shaving
came
downstairs
to
the
ellen
keenans
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
a
book
in
her
hand
up
already
dear
asked
morrison
and
bent
to
kiss
the
girl
she
laid
down
the
book
which
she
had
been
reading
and
met
the
kiss
with
her
lips
the
country
life
is
so
quiet
so
refreshing
one
can
not
have
too
much
of
it
she
said
drumming
idly
with
her
fingers
on
the
edge
of
the
sofa
what
are
you
reading
dear
the
young
man
asked
kautsky
s
of
materialist
conception
of
rather
a
big
thing
to
tackle
before
she
cast
a
look
of
reproof
at
the
young
man
lifted
the
book
from
the
table
then
as
if
something
occurred
to
her
laid
it
down
again
you
haven
t
read
it
i
bet
she
said
then
before
he
could
answer
you
promised
last
night
to
let
me
see
some
queer
people
wrecks
of
the
social
who
live
on
this
an
old
man
and
woman
said
morrison
a
quaint
pair
they
are
stunted
and
seedy
they
seem
to
have
no
souls
but
i
suppose
deep
down
within
them
there
is
some
eternal
goodness
some
fundamental
who
are
you
quoting
asked
the
girl
getting
to
her
feet
where
are
these
two
people
in
an
outhouse
near
by
he
told
her
it
s
terrible
the
abyss
to
which
some
people
sink
he
went
on
how
many
of
these
derelicts
might
be
saved
if
some
restraining
hand
was
reached
out
to
help
them
if
some
charitable
soul
would
take
pity
on
when
did
you
begin
to
look
upon
charity
as
a
means
of
remedying
social
evils
asked
the
girl
almost
fiercely
charity
is
a
bribe
paid
to
the
maltreated
so
that
they
may
hold
their
morrison
as
was
his
custom
when
the
girl
spoke
in
that
manner
became
silent
in
here
he
said
when
they
arrived
at
the
dilapidated
door
of
the
in
there
questioned
the
girl
and
looked
at
morrison
morrison
entered
with
rather
an
important
air
he
was
showing
a
new
world
to
his
fair
companion
the
girl
hesitated
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
then
followed
the
young
man
into
the
dark
interior
donal
and
jean
were
seated
at
the
fire
drinking
tea
from
the
same
can
on
a
small
and
dirty
board
which
lay
on
the
ground
between
them
a
chunk
of
dry
bread
and
a
little
lump
of
butter
could
be
seen
the
two
occupants
of
the
sty
took
very
little
notice
of
the
visitors
the
man
said
gruffly
the
woman
looked
critically
at
the
girl
s
dress
then
went
on
with
her
meal
it
must
be
cold
here
said
the
young
girl
looking
curiously
round
and
noticing
a
streak
of
grey
daylight
stealing
through
the
roof
jean
is
it
cold
here
asked
the
man
by
the
fire
biting
the
end
of
his
crust
as
cold
as
the
grave
answered
the
woman
ellen
keenans
looked
closely
at
the
speaker
the
broken
nose
almost
on
a
level
with
her
face
the
pockmarked
flesh
of
the
cheeks
and
chin
the
red
eyelids
the
watery
expressionless
eyes
filled
the
young
lady
with
nauseous
horror
in
the
renovated
society
of
which
ellen
keenans
dreamt
this
woman
would
be
entirely
out
of
place
just
as
much
as
her
sweetheart
and
herself
with
their
clothing
their
soft
leather
shoes
and
gold
rings
were
out
of
place
here
and
these
two
people
the
man
who
wolfed
up
his
bread
like
a
dog
and
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
might
have
something
great
and
good
in
their
natures
alec
had
given
such
sentiments
voice
often
how
he
was
she
thought
the
door
of
the
building
faced
east
the
early
sun
rising
over
a
bank
of
grey
clouds
suddenly
beamed
forth
with
splendid
ray
and
lit
up
the
dark
interior
of
the
sty
this
beautiful
beam
disclosed
what
the
darkness
had
hidden
the
dirt
and
squalor
of
the
place
the
floor
on
which
crawled
numberless
wood
lice
and
beetles
was
indented
with
holes
filled
with
filthy
smelling
water
and
the
blank
walls
were
literally
covered
with
reddish
cockroaches
the
sunlight
beamed
on
a
spider
s
web
hanging
from
the
roof
the
thin
silky
threads
were
covered
with
dead
insects
rats
had
burrowed
into
the
base
of
the
walls
and
the
whole
building
was
permeated
with
an
overpowering
and
unhealthy
odour
ellen
keenans
glanced
up
at
the
joists
where
the
struck
them
then
down
the
stretch
of
dark
slimy
wall
down
down
to
the
floor
and
there
in
bold
relief
against
the
darkness
she
saw
in
all
its
youthful
beauty
the
face
of
a
sleeping
girl
ellen
turned
an
enquiring
glance
to
the
woman
by
the
fire
then
to
morrison
whose
face
wore
a
troubled
expression
who
have
you
here
donal
asked
the
young
man
a
lass
that
we
found
greetin
outside
your
door
last
night
said
the
man
this
time
not
appealing
to
jean
for
an
answer
happen
that
ye
know
her
the
two
by
the
fire
looked
at
the
young
couple
the
woman
s
watery
eyes
took
on
a
new
expression
they
seemed
suddenly
to
have
become
charged
with
condemnation
and
contempt
is
she
one
of
jim
scanlon
s
squad
asked
morrison
although
putting
the
question
he
had
recognised
norah
instantly
and
now
he
wished
to
be
away
donal
and
jean
looked
suddenly
terrible
in
his
eyes
the
pity
he
felt
for
them
a
moment
ago
now
gave
place
to
a
fear
for
himself
odd
little
waves
of
expression
were
passing
over
the
woman
s
face
and
in
her
eyes
he
read
a
terrible
accusation
it
was
all
her
fault
not
mine
he
muttered
under
his
breath
that
night
and
the
dog
howling
and
the
stars
out
above
us
but
it
was
all
her
own
fault
why
did
she
keep
following
me
about
she
might
have
known
that
i
could
never
have
we
ll
go
back
to
the
house
now
he
said
aloud
to
ellen
keenans
we
ve
seen
all
that
is
to
be
the
girl
glanced
at
him
interrogatively
curious
who
is
she
came
the
question
ye
ll
soon
know
said
the
woman
by
the
fire
rising
and
going
to
the
by
the
wall
wake
up
lass
she
cried
to
the
sleeper
norah
rose
in
bed
her
mind
groping
darkly
with
her
surroundings
she
had
been
dreaming
of
home
and
wakened
with
a
vivid
remembrance
of
her
mother
s
cabin
still
in
her
mind
the
light
of
the
sun
shone
full
in
her
face
and
she
lifted
her
hand
up
to
shield
her
eyes
then
in
a
flash
it
was
borne
to
her
where
she
had
spent
the
night
several
dark
objects
stood
between
her
and
the
door
these
developed
into
a
grouping
of
persons
in
the
midst
of
which
alec
morrison
stood
out
definitely
norah
fully
dressed
just
as
she
had
gone
to
sleep
moved
towards
him
alec
morrison
i
ve
come
back
she
said
paused
and
looked
at
the
girl
beside
him
then
began
to
talk
hurriedly
i
left
the
squad
the
day
before
yesterday
i
travelled
all
the
dark
night
and
lost
me
way
for
me
mind

be
busy
with
the
thoughts
that

coming
to

last
night
i
came
to
yer
door
alec
morrison
why

ye
so
scared
lookin
sure
ye
re
not

of

morrison
was
in
a
very
awkward
fix
and
this
he
confessed
to
himself
he
never
intended
to
marry
the
girl
and
never
for
a
moment
thought
that
the
adventure
of
christmas
eve
would
lead
him
into
such
a
predicament
and
you
are
as
well
rid
of
her
some
evil
voice
whispered
in
his
ear
look
at
her
as
she
is
now

she
a
suitable
companion
for
you
morrison
gazed
covertly
at
the
girl
her
hair
which
had
not
been
combed
for
two
days
hung
over
her
eyes
and
ears
in
tangled
tufts
even
the
face
which
still
retained
all
its
splendid
beauty
was
blackened
by
the
dust
which
had
fallen
from
the
roof
during
the
night
are
ye
goin
to
do
the
right
thing
to
the
girl
asked
donal
it
s
the
only
way
out
of
it
if
ye
have
the
spirit
of
a
man
in
morrison
gazed
blankly
at
the
man
then
at
norah
a
fierce
and
almost
animal
look
came
into
her
eyes
as
she
faced
him
i
ll
do
the
right
thing
he
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
and
turned
and
went
out
of
the
building
ellen
keenans
following
at
his
heels
norah
watched
them
go
making
no
effort
to
detain
them
when
they
went
out
she
tottered
towards
the
wall
reaching
upwards
with
her
hands
as
if
wanting
to
touch
resignation
it
s
all
over
she
exclaimed
it
s
him
that
has
the
black
heart
and
will
be
goin
to
do
the
right
thing
with
little
bits
of
money
the
right
thing
she
leant
against
the
wall
her
little
voice
raised
in
loud
protest
against
the
monstrous
futility
of
existence
iii
an
hour
later
morrison
returned
to
the
sty
carrying
gold
in
his
pocket
but
feeling
very
awkward
he
and
ellen
had
quarrelled
when
they
went
out
into
the
open
from
the
sty
she
turned
on
him
fiercely
how
many
of
these
souls
might
be
saved
if
some
restraining
hand
was
reached
out
to
help
them
she
quoted
sneeringly
but
ellen
it
was
more
the
girl
s
fault
than
mine
and
when
one
is
young
one
may
do
many
things
that
he
s
sorry
for
afterwards
and
i
ll
do
the
right
thing
for
the
the
right
thing
queried
ellen
keenans
and
a
troubled
expression
settled
on
her
face
but
you
can
not
it
s
impossible
to
two
i
m
wealthy
now
you
know
my
allowance
oh
i
see
said
the
girl
and
strangely
enough
a
suggestion
of
relief
blended
with
her
voice
i
suppose
you
ll
think
me
a
prig
ellen
said
the
young
man
but
it
wasn
t
altogether
my
fault
neither
was
it
the
girl
s
i
suppose
i
suppose
it
was
fate
the
girl
won
t
be
highly
sensitive
i
ve
seen
ones
working
here
on
the
farm
young
women
and
they
made
a
slip
but
it
did
not
seem
to
affect
them
and
we
all
make
mistakes
ellen
his
speech
came
to
an
end
and
he
left
her
and
went
towards
the
house
an
hour
later
he
the
sty
the
woman
with
the
face
looked
at
him
angrily
norah
sat
beside
her
on
the
upturned
box
one
arm
hanging
loosely
by
her
side
the
other
resting
on
her
knees
the
hand
pressed
against
her
chin
and
a
tapering
finger
stretching
along
her
cheek
the
old
woman
had
given
norah
a
broken
comb
to
dress
her
hair
and
now
it
hung
to
her
waist
in
long
wavy
tresses
but
in
the
middle
of
the
work
she
had
dropped
the
comb
and
fallen
into
a
deep
reverie
i
ve
come
to
see
you
morrison
began
with
an
abruptness
which
showed
that
he
wanted
to
hurry
over
a
distasteful
job
he
was
going
to
make
atonement
for
his
sin
and
atonement
represented
a
few
pieces
of
gold
a
few
months
denial
of
the
luxuries
which
this
gold
could
procure
he
looked
straight
at
norah
s
bowed
head
taking
no
notice
of
the
other
occupants
of
the
hovel
i
ve
come
to
see
you
he
repeated
but
the
girl
paid
no
heed
to
him
he
drew
an
envelope
from
his
pocket
shook
it
so
that
the
money
within
made
a
loud
rattle
and
placed
it
on
her
lap
the
girl
roused
herself
abruptly
as
if
stung
lifted
the
envelope
and
looked
at
the
man
fearing
that
she
was
going
to
fling
the
terrible
packet
in
his
face
he
put
up
his
hand
to
shield
himself
norah
smiled
coldly
and
then
handed
him
back
the
packet
which
he
had
not
the
courage
to
refuse
nor
the
audacity
to
return
the
girl
seemed
to
be
performing
some
task
that
had
no
interest
for
her
something
out
and
beyond
the
scope
of
her
life
for
a
moment
morrison
felt
it
in
him
to
pity
her
but
deep
down
in
his
heart
he
pitied
himself
more
i
thought
i
would
like
you
know
that
he
stammered
i
ll
go
away
just
now
he
said
in
a
low
voice
you
d
better
said
donal
crouching
by
the
fire
like
a
cat
ready
to
spring
alec
morrison
left
the
sty
at
the
hour
of
noon
norah
bade
to

shortly
after

the

those
who

were
turned
out
to
the
streets
it

late
in
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which

left

she
groped
her
way
up
a
narrow
alley
to
the
foot
of
a
stair
and
there
suddenly
stepped
on
a
warm
human
body
lying
on

way
through
some
thick
fluid
in
the
speaker

throat
the
darkness
of

grimy

ii
ten
minutes
later
the
two
women
were
seated
in
the
kitchen
of
the
frying
a
chop
which
norah
had
bought
on
their
way
to
the
the
place
was
crowded
with
women
of
all
ages
some
young
children
almost
their
hair
hanging
down
their
backs
and
the
blouses
that
their
pinched
breasts
could
not
fill
sagging
loose
at
the
bosom
there
were
six
or
seven
of
these
girls
queer
weedy
things
that
smoked
cigarettes
and
used
foul
words
whenever
they
spoke
the
face
of
one
was
pitted
with
another
had
both
eyes
blackened
the
result
of
a
fight
a
third
clean
of
face
and
limb
was
telling
how
she
had
just
served
two
months
in
prison
for
importuning
men
on
the
streets
several
of
the
elder
females
were
drunk
two
fought
in
the
kitchen
pulling
handfuls
of
hair
from
one
another
s
heads
nobody
interfered
when
the
struggle
came
to
an
end
the
combatants
sat
down
together
and
warmed
their
hands
at
the
stove
at
this
juncture
a
woman
with
clay
caked
brown
behind
her
ankles
and
a
hairy
wart
on
her
chin
came
up
to

pointed
at
the
girl
with
a
long
crooked
finger
and
norah

said
the
woman
then
turning

outside
the
free
coup
asked
the
young

shrug
of
her
shoulders

said
mary
sitting
down
on
a
bench
near
the
stove
the
girl
laughed
vacantly
tried
to
make
a
ring
of
the
cigarette
smoke
was
unable
to
do
so
and
walked
away
mary
martin
turned
to
maudie
and
whispered
something
to
her
ah

maudie
and
the
one
to
blame

a
toff

mary

beg

said
mary
martin
and
the
three
women
drew
closer
to
the
chop
that
was
roasting
on
the
stove
iii
the
beds
in
the
forty
in
all
were
in
a
large
chamber
upstairs
and
each
woman
had
a
bed
to
herself
the
lodgers
undressed
openly
shoved
their
clothes
under
the
mattresses
and
slid
into
bed
one
sat
down
to
unlace
her
boots
and
fell
asleep
where
she
sat
another
a
young
girl
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
fell
against
the
leg
of
the
bed
and
sank
into
slumber
her
face
turned
to
the
roof
and
her
mouth
wide
open
the
girl
who
had
been
in
prison
became
suddenly
unwell
and
burst
into
tears
nobody
knew
what
she
was
weeping
about
and
nobody
enquired
maudie
mary
and
norah
slept
in
three
adjoining
beds
the
irish
girl
in
the
centre
the
two
older
women
dropped
off
to
sleep
the
moment
their
heads
touched
the
pillows
norah
lay
awake
gazing
at
the
flickering
shadows
cast
by
the
solitary
on
the
roof
of
the
room
the
heat
was
oppressive
suffocating
almost
and
not
a
window
in
the
place
was
open
women
were
still
coming
in
and
only
half
the
bunks
in
the
room
were
yet
occupied
most
of
the
were
drunk
some
sat
down
or
fell
on
the
floor
and
slept
where
they
had
fallen
others
threw
themselves
in
on
top
of
the
bed
and
lay
there
with
their
clothes
on
an
old
woman
whose
eye
had
been
blackened
in
a
fight
downstairs
started
to
sing
annie
laurie
but
forgetting
what
followed
the
first
verse
relapsed
into
silence
norah
began
to
pray
under
her
breath
to
the
virgin
but
had
only
got
half
through
with
her
prayer
when
a
shriek
from
the
bed
on
her
left
startled
her
maudie
was
sitting
upright
yelling
at
the
top
of
her
voice
can
not

an
old
body

she
cried
i
m
only
wantin

and

only
an
old
woman
maudie
opened
her
watery
eyes
and
stared
round
beads
of
sweat
stood
out
on
her
forehead
and
her
face
red
as
a
crab
looked
terrifying
in
the
of
the
room
beg
pardon
she
croaked
and
her
voice
had
a
sound
like
the
breaking
of
bones
beg
pardon
i
m
only
an
old
woman
and
i
never
did
nobody
no
harm
she
sank
down
again
pulled
the
blankets
over
her
shoulders
and
fell
asleep
fresh
arrivals
came
in
every
minute
staggered
wearily
to
their
bunks
and
threw
themselves
down
without
undressing
about
midnight
a
female
attendant
a
young
neat
girl
with
a
pleasing
face
entered
surveyed
the
room
helped
those
who
lay
on
the
floor
into
bed
turned
down
the
gas
and
went
away
slumber
would
not
come
to
norah
all
night
she
lay
awake
listening
to
the
noise
of
the
on
the
pavement
outside
the
chiming
of
church
clocks
the
deep
breathing
of
the
sleepers
all
around
her
and
the
sudden
yells
from
maudie
s
bunk
as
the
woman
started
in
her
sleep
protesting
against
some
grievance
or
voicing
some
ancient
wrong
the
daylight
was
stealing
through
the
grimy
window
when
norah
got
up
and
proceeded
to
dress
a
deep
quietness
broken
only
by
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
women
lay
over
the
whole
place
the
feeble
light
of
daybreak
shone
on
the
ashen
faces
of
the
sleepers
on
the
naked
body
of
a
girl
who
had
flung

chapter
xxv
sheila
carrol
i
norah
travelled
through
the
streets
all
day
looking
for
her
friend
and
fearing
that
every
eye
was
fixed
on
her
that
everybody
knew
the
secret
which
she
tried
to
conceal
her
feet
were
sore
her
breath
came
in
short
sudden
gasps
as
she
took
her
way
into
dark
closes
and
climbed
creaking
stairs
and
never
were
her
efforts
rewarded
by
success
here
in
the
poorer
parts
of
the
city
in
the
crooked
lanes
and
straggling
alleys
were
dirt
darkness
and
drunkenness
a
thousand
smells
greeted
the
nostrils
a
thousand
noises
grated
on
the
ears
lights
flared
brightly
in
the
beershops
fights
started
at
the
corners
ballad
singers
croaked
out
their
songs
intoxicated
men
fell
in
the
gutters
policemen
stood
at
every
turning
their
helmets
glistening
their
faces
calm
their
eyes
watchful
the
evening
had
come
and
all
was
noise
hurry
and
excitement
isaac
levison
pawnbroker
up
norah
read
on
a
plate
outside
the
entrance
of
a
close
and
went
in
i
wonder
if
sheila
will
be
here
she
asked
herself
and
smiled
sadly
as
she
called
to
mind
the
number
of
closes
she
had
crawled
into
during
the
whole
long
trying
day
dragging
her
feet
after
her
she
made
her
way
up
the
crooked
stairs
and
rapped
with
her
knuckles
at
a
door
on
which
the
words
caretaker
s
office
were
painted
in
black
letters
a
woman
with
a
string
for
a
neck
and
wisps
of
red
hair
hanging
over
her
face
poked
out
her
head
up
yet
was
the
answer
when
norah
asked
if
anybody
named
sheila
carrol
dwelt
on
the
stairs
after
all
my
searchin
she
s
here
at
last
said
the
young
woman
it
s
sheila
carrol
herself
that
s
in
the
the
beansho
opened
the
door
when
she
heard
a
rapping
outside
she
knew
her
visitor
at
once
come
in
norah
ryan
she
said
catching
the
girl
s
hands
and
squeezing
them
tightly
it
s
good
of
ye
to
come
no
one
from
frosses
only
oiney
dinchy
s
gasair
have
i
seen
here
for
a
long
while
but
ye
ll
be
tired
child
it
s
in
an
ill
way
that
i
come
to
see
ye
sheila
carrol
said
norah
it
s
an
ill
way
indeed
it
is
and
then
sitting
down
she
told
her
story
quietly
as
if
that
which
she
spoke
of
did
not
interest
her
in
any
way
poor
child
said
sheila
when
the
pitiful
tale
came
to
an
end
why
has
god
put
that
burden
on
yer
little
shoulders
but
there
s
no
use
in
pining
norah
mind
that
child
i
would
like
to
die
sheila
carrol
said
norah
looking
round
the
bare
room
but
not
feeling
in
the
least
interested
in
what
she
saw
one
chair
a
bed
a
holy
water
stoup
a
little
black
crucifix
from
which
the
arms
of
the
christ
had
fallen
away
an
orange
box
on
which
lay
a
pair
of
scissors
and
a
pile
of
cloth
that
was
all
the
room
contained
a
feeble
fire
burned
in
the
grate
and
a
battered
threw
a
dim
light
over
the
compartment
i
once
had
thoughts
that
were
like
that
meself
said
sheila
she
placed
a
little
tin
pannikin
on
the
fire
and
fanned
the
flame
with
her
apron
people
face
a
terrible
lot
in
body
and
in
soul
before
they
face
death
that
s
the
way
god
made
us
child
we
do
be
like
grains
of
corn
under
a
and
everything
but
the
breath
of
our
bodies
squeezed
out
of
us
sometimes
i
do
be
thinkin
that
the
word
hope
is
blotted
from
me
soul
but
then
after
a
wee
while
i
do
be
happy
in
my
own
way
but
did
ye
not
find
yer
own
burden
hard
to
bear
sheila
hard
indeed
child
but
it
s
trouble
that
makes
us
wise
said
the
beansho
pouring
tea
into
the
pannikin
that
was
now
bubbling
merrily
the
father
of
me
boy
died
on
the
sea
and
me
goin
to
be
married
to
him
when
the
season
of
lent
was
by
the
cold
grey
morning
when
the
boat
came
in
keel
up
on
dooey
strand
was
a
hard
and
black
one
for
me
ah
the
cold
break
of
day
sorrow
take
it
the
child
came
and
i
was
not
sorry
at
all
as
the
people
thought
i
should
be
he
was
like
the
man
i
loved
and
if
the
bitin
tongues
of
the
frosses
people
was
quiet
i
would
be
very
happy
i
would
indeed
norah
but
over
here
in
this
country
it
was
sore
and
bitter
to
me
i
mind
the
first
night
that
i
stopped
in
glasgow
with
the
little
boy
he
was
between
my
arms
and
i
was
lookin
out
through
the
window
of
at
the
big
clock
with
the
light
inside
of
it
it
was
a
lazy
clock
that
night
and
i
thought
that
the
light
of
day
would
never
put
a
colour
on
the
sky
but
the
mornin
did
come
and
many
mornin
s
since
then
and
they
were
too
then
sheila
told
the
story
of
her
life
in
scotland
and
norah
hardly
realising
what
was
spoken
listened
almost
dumbly
feeling
at
intervals
the
child
within
her
moving
restlessly
stretching
out
as
if
with
a
hand
and
pressing
against
her
side
causing
a
quivering
motion
to
run
through
her
body
sheila
s
story
was
a
pitiful
one
when
first
she
came
to
glasgow
she
took
an
attic
room
at
the
top
of
a
building
and
for
this
she
paid
a
weekly
rent
of
three
shillings
and
sixpence
twas
the
dirty
place
to
live
in
norah
for
all
the
smells
and
stinks
of
the
houses
down
under
came
up
to
me
said
the
woman
and
three
white
shillin
s
and
sixpence
a
week
for
that
place
that
one
wouldn
t
put
pigs
into
the
houses
away
at
home
may
be
bad
but
there
s
always
the
fresh
air
and
no
drunk
men
or
bad
women
lyin
across
yer
door
every
time
ye
go
outside
was
a
rotten
place
worse
even
than
this
and
this
is
bad
look
at
the
sheets
and
blankets
on
the
bed
behind
ye
norah
look
at
the
colour
of
them
and
the
writin
on
norah
gazed
at
the
bed
and
saw
on
every
article
of
clothing
stamped
in
large
blue
letters
the
words
stolen
from
james
that
s
because
someone
may
steal
the
rags
said
sheila
this
room
is
furnished
by
the
landlord
god
forgive
him
for
the
furnishin
of
it
and
he
s
afraid
that
his
tenants
will
run
away
and
try
to
pawn
the
bedclothes
lyin
under
the
blankets
all
night
with
stolen
from
james
moffat
writ
on
them
is
a
quare
way
of
sleepin
but
what
can
a
woman
like
me
do
and
was
worse
nor
this
and
the
work
twas
beyond
speakin
about
the
first
job
i
got
was
the
finishin
of
dongaree
jackets
sewin
buttons
on
them
and
things
like
that
i
was
up
in
the
mornin
at
six
and
went
to
bed
the
next
mornin
at
one
and
hard
at
it
all
the
time
i
wasn
t
sleepin
sunday
was
the
same
as
any
other
day
always
work
always
the
needle
i
used
to
make
seven
shillin
s
a
week
half
of
that
went
in
rent
and
the
other
half
kept
meself
and
my
boy
talk
about
teeth
growin
long
with
hunger
at
times
when
the
work
was
none
too
plentiful
sometimes
norah
sheila
paused
norah
was
listening
intently
her
lips
a
little
apart
like
a
child
s
sometimes
norah
i
went
out
beggin
on
the
streets
me
a
frosses
woman
too
sheila
resumed
with
a
sigh
then
one
night
when
i
asked
a
gentleman
for
a
few
pence
to
buy
bread
he
handed
me
over
to
the
police
said
i
was
accostin
him
i
didn
t
even
know
what
it
meant
at
the
time
now
but
i
hope
ye
never
know
what
it
means
anyway
i
was
sent
to
jail
for
three
to
jail
sheila
norah
exclaimed
true
as
god
child
and
my
boy
left
alone
in
that
dirty
attic
there
was
i
not
knowin
what
was
happenin
to
him
and
when
i
came
out
of
prison
i
heard
that
the
police
had
caught
him
wanderin
out
in
the
streets
and
put
him
in
a
home
but
i
didn
t
see
him
i
was
slapped
into
jail
what
for
sheila
child
neglect
girsha
said
the
woman
lifting
her
scissors
and
cutting
fiercely
at
a
strip
of
cloth
as
she
spoke
i
don
t
know
how
they
made
it
out
again
me
but
the
law
is
far
beyond
simple
people
like
us
i
was
put
in
for
three
months
that
time
and
when
i
came
out
a
tear
dropped
from
sheila
s
eyes
and
fell
on
the
cloth
which
lay
on
her
lap
the
little
fellow
god
rest
his
soul
was
dead
said
the
woman
then
i
hadn
t
much
to
live
for
and
i
was
like
to
die
but
people
can
stand
a
lot
one
way
and
another
a
terrible
lot
entirely
after
that
i
thought
of
making
shirts
and
i
got
a
sewin
machine
from
a
big
firm
on
the
instalment
system
a
shillin
a
week
i
had
to
pay
for
the
machine
i
could
have
done
well
at
the
but
things
seemed
somehow
to
be
again
me
on
the
sixth
week
i
couldn
t
pay
the
shillin
it
was
due
on
a
friday
and
saturday
was
my
own
pay
day
i
prayed
to
the
traveller
to
wait
for
the
morrow
but
he
wouldn
t
and
took
the
machine
away
twas
the
big
firm
of
too
that
did
that
think
of
it
them
with
their
mills
and
their
riches
and
me
only
a
poor
woman
nor
it
wasn
t
as
if
i
wasn
t
wantin
to
pay
neither
but
that
s
the
way
of
the
world
girsha
the
bad
black
world
cold
as
the
rocks
on
dooey
strand
it
is
aye
and
colder
sometimes
after
the
sewin
machine
went
i
used
to
go
out
on
the
streets
and
sing
songs
and
at
that
sort
of
work
not
at
all
becomin
for
a
frosses
woman
i
could
always
make
the
price
of
a
bunk
in
the
the
place
where
ye
were
last
night
norah
ah
how
often
have
i
had
my
night
s
sleep
there
then
again
i
would
come
back
to
and
start
some
decent
work
that
wasn
t
half
as
easy
or
half
as
well
paid
as
the
singin
of
songs
so
i
went
from
one
thing
to
another
and
here
i
am
at
this
very
sheila
paused
in
her
talk
but
not
in
the
work
which
she
had
just
started
not
much
of
a
room
this
one
neither
she
remarked
casting
her
eye
on
the
bed
but
not
missing
a
stitch
in
her
sewing
as
she
spoke
four
shillin
s
i
pay
for
it
a
week
and
it
s
supposed
to
hold
two
people
outside
the
door
you
can
see
that
ticketed
up
to
hold
two
adults
like
the
price
marked
on
a
pair
of
secondhand
trousers
i
m
all
alone
here
only
the
woman
old
meg
that
stops
in
the
room
behind
this
one
passes
through
here
on
her
way
to
work
but
ye
ll
stay
here
with
me
now
two
frosses
people
in
the
one
room
so
to
what
kind
of
work
are
ye
doin
here
asked
norah
pointing
to
the
cloth
which
sheila
was
sewing
sheila
replied
for
every
shirt
there
s
two
rows
of
eight
buttonholes
and
seven
buttons
sewed
on
four
seams
and
eight
fasteners
it
takes
me
over
an
hour
to
do
each
shirt
and
the
pay
is
a
penny
farthing
i
can
make
about
fifteen
pence
a
day
but
out
of
that
i
have
to
buy
my
own
thread
but
ye
ll
be
tired
child
listenin
to
me
clatterin
here
all
i
m
not
tired
listenin
to
ye
at
all
but
it
s
sorrow
that
s
with
me
because
life
was
so
hard
on
ye
said
norah
everything
was
black
again
one
gets
used
to
it
all
said
sheila
with
the
air
of
resignation
which
sits
on
the
shoulders
of
those
to
whom
the
keys
of
that
delicious
mystery
known
as
happiness
are
forever
lost
one
gets
used
to
things
no
matter
how
hard
they
be
and
one
doesn
t
like
to
but
now
norah
listened
almost
heedlessly
thoughts
dropped
into
her
mind
and
vanished
with
the
frightful
rapidity
of
things
falling
into
empty
space
and
memories
of
still
more
remote
things
faint
far
away
and
almost
undefined
were
wafted
against
her
soul
the
girl
fell
into
a
heavy
slumber
ii
in
the
morning
she
awoke
to
find
herself
lying
in
bed
the
blankets
on
which
the
blue
letters
stolen
from
james
moffat
were
stamped
wrapped
tightly
around
her
and
sheila
carrol
lying
by
her
side
for
a
moment
she
wondered
vaguely
how
she
had
got
into
the
bunk
then
raising
herself
on
her
elbow
she
looked
round
the
room
the
apartment
was
a
very
small
one
with
one
window
and
two
doors
one
of
which
led
as
norah
knew
out
to
the
landing
and
one
as
she
guessed
into
the
room
belonging
to
old
meg
the
woman
whom
sheila
had
spoken
of
the
night
before
the
window
was
cracked
and
crooked
the
floor
and
doors
creaked
at
every
move
a
musty
odour
of
decay
and
death
filled
the
whole
place
a
heap
of
white
shirts
was
piled
on
the
orange
box
that
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
one
shirt
the
finishing
of
which
had
not
been
completed
lay
on
an
old
newspaper
beside
the
fireplace
it
looked
as
if
sheila
had
become
suddenly
tired
in
the
midst
of
her
and
had
slipped
into
bed
she
was
now
awake
and
almost
as
soon
as
she
had
opened
her
eyes
was
out
of
the
blankets
had
wrapped
a
few
rags
round
her
bony
frame
and
was
busy
at
work
with
her
needle
sleep
for
the
woman
was
only
a
slight
interruption
of
her
eternal
routine
have
a
wee
wink
more
she
cried
to
norah
and
i
ll
just
make
a
good
warm
cup
of
tay
for
ye
when
i
get
this
row
finished
little
rogue
of
all
the
world
ye
re
tired
out
and
worn
norah
smiled
sadly
got
up
dressed

said
the

admirin

remarked
meg
with
a
wheezy
laugh
as
she
took
her
place
beside
the
girl
at
the
window
a
fine
sight
to
look
at
that
dirty
washin

a
paved
courtyard
at

at

a
stable
with
a
heap
of
manure
piled
high
outside

door
two
grey
rats
could
be

running
across
from

to
the
stable
a
ragged
tramp

on
the
warm
dunghill
shuffled
up
to
his
feet
rubbed
the
sleep
and
dirt
from

place

if
conscious
of
having
done
something
very
wrong

slept
here
for
many
a

then
pointing
her
finger
upwards
over
the

of

high
through
the
air

chapter
xxvi
the
passing
days
i
they
came
and
went
days
monotonously
slow
each
bearing
with
it
its
burden
of
sorrows
and
regrets
of
fear
and
unhappiness
the
life
of
the
two
women
was
ever
the
same
out
of
bed
at
five
in
the
morning
a
salutation
exchanged
with
old
meg
as
she
went
to
her
work
breakfast
a
crust
of
bread
and
a
cup
of
tea
the
light
weak
and
sickly
peeping
through
the
narrow
murky
window
the
eternal
scissors
and
needles
the
white
heaps
of
shirts
the
and
finishing
in
the
morning
the
cripple
next
door
clattered
downstairs
on
crutches
the
card
with
the
rude
inscription
paralysed
for
life
shaking
to
and
fro
as
he
moved
all
day
long
he
lay
on
the
cold
flagged
pavement
begging
his
daily
bread
tommy
macara
the
lad
with
the
rickets
came
out
singing
to
the
landing
on
his
way
to
the
industrial
school
he
stuck
his
head
through
the
door
and
shouted
ye
twa
women
warkin
both
loved
little
tommy
his
cheery
laugh
his
childish
carelessness
his
poor
body
twisted
out
of
shape
by
the
humours
of
early
disease
his
legs
would
twitch
as
he
stood
at
the
door
making
an
effort
to
control
the
tremors
sometimes
he
would
laugh
awkwardly
at
this
and
hurry
away
thus
the
morning
a
quarrel
at
no
the
two
loose
women
who
lived
there
argued
about
the
spoils
taken
from
a
drunken
sailor
the
night
before
and
came
to
blows
one
was
dressed
the
other
just
out
of
bed
had
only
time
to
wrap
the
blanket
round
her
body
both
came
out
on
the
landing
tearing
at
each
other
s
hair
and
swearing
all
the
doors
in
the
place
opened
women
ragged
to
the
point
of
nudity
men
dirty
and
unshaven
hurried
out
to
watch
the
fight
which
was
long
and
severe
the
women
bit
and
scratched
and
the
younger
bessie
was
her
name
a
plump
girl
wearing
the
blanket
on
which
the
words
stolen
from
james
moffat
could
be
read
at
a
distance
was
deprived
of
her
only
article
of
apparel
and
she
scurried
rapidly
indoors
the
onlookers
laughed
loudly
and
clapped
their
hands
the
elder
a
lassie
with
very
white
teeth
returned
to
her
room
closing
the
door
behind
her
now
and
again
a
shriek
could
be
heard
from
the
apartment
then
a
hoarse
gurgle
as
if
somebody
was
getting
strangled
afterwards
silence
the
watchers
retired
indoors
and
peace
settled
on
the
stairhead
only
the
two
women
sheila
and
norah
never
ceased
work
the
needles
and
scissors
still
sparkled
over
and
through
the
white
shirts
meg
returned
and
singing
a
chorus
half
the
words
of
which
she
had
forgotten
the
day
s
work
had
been
a
very
trying
one
the
dust
rising
from
the
rags
did
not
agree
with
her
asthma
on
entering
she
looked
fixedly
at
sheila
shook
her
head
sadly
ran
her
fingers
over
norah
s
hair
and
began
the
chorus
again
but
stopped
in
the
middle
of
it
and
started
to
weep
after
a
while
she
reeled
into
her
own
room
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
sank
to
sleep
on
the
floor
beside
the
dead
fire
little
tom
macara
came
up
the
stair
looked
in
the
eternal
smile
on
his
pinched
face
and
cried
out
in
a
thin
voice
ah
the
women
are
warkin
awa
yet
they
never
have
a
meenit
to
spare
never
a
minute
tom
sheila
answered
and
the
boy
went
off
whistling
a
tune
tom
s
mother
was
consumptive
his
father
epileptic
he
had
two
brothers
and
three
sisters
all
older
than
himself
after
tom
the
man
with
the
crutches
came
upstairs
from
the
street
to
the
top
of
the
landing
was
a
weary
climb
but
often
he
got
helped
on
the
journey
sometimes
the
two
whores
escorted
him
up
sometimes
sheila
gave
him
an
arm
and
everybody
on
the
stairs
liked
the
man
he
was
always
in
good
humour
and
could
sing
a
capital
song
later
in
the
evening
those
who
indulged
in
intoxicants
became
drunk
an
with
one
sleeve
of
his
coat
hanging
loosely
from
his
shoulder
who
lived
with
two
women
kicked
one
unmercifully
and
got
dragged
off
to
prison
the
two
harlots
netted
two
men
one
of
them
a
fellow
with
a
gold
and
a
ring
on
his
finger
and
took
them
to
their
room
the
paralytic
could
be
heard
singing
and
his
voice
seemed
to
be
ever
so
far
away
sheila
and
norah
were
still
busy
with
the
shirts
sewing
their
lives
into
every
stitch
of
their
work
and
them
two
women
at
no
there
s
not
the
least
bit
of
harm
in
them
at
bottom
sheila
would
exclaim
they
help
the
old
cripple
up
every
time
they
meet
him
on
the
stairs
and
to
think
of
it
there
s
seventeen
thousand
women
like
them
in
glasgow
god
be
good
to
us
midnight
came
and
quiet
and
still
the
two
women
worked
on
outside
on
the
landing
into
the
common
sink
the
water
kept
dripping
from
the
tap
sheila
made
a
remark
about
the
people
away
home
in
frosses
and
wondered
if
they
were
all
asleep
at
that
moment
outside
the
city
sank
to
its
repose
only
the
unfortunate
and
the
unwell
were
now
awake
the
epileptic
s
wife
coughed
continually
bessie
the
plump
girl
stole
the
pin
from
the
tie
of
her
lover
downstairs
the
caretaker
the
woman
with
the
red
wisps
of
hair
counted
the
number
of
men
who
went
to
no
half
the
profits
went
to
her
one
o
clock
came
and
as
if
by
mutual
consent
the
irish
women
left
their
work
aside
and
looked
out
of
the
window
for
a
moment
high
up
they
could
see
the
spire
of
the
town
hall
prodding
into
the
heavens
nearer
and
almost
as
high
the
tower
of
a
church
with
the
black
hands
passing
on
the
lighted
face
of
a
clock
closer
still
the
dark
windows
of
the
houses
opposite
glasgow
with
all
its
churches
its
halls
with
its
shipping
and
commerce
its
wharves
and
factories
its
richness
and
splendour
its
poor
and
unhappy
its
oppressed
and
miserable
glasgow
with
its
seventeen
thousand
prostitutes
was
asleep
ii
norah
and
sheila
went
to
bed
wrapped
the
blankets
round
their
bodies
and
placed
their
heads
down
on
the
condemnatory
sentences
stolen
from
james
moffat
almost
immediately
sheila
was
asleep
her
knees
drawn
up
under
her
for
the
bed
was
too
short
for
her
body
and
her
arms
around
norah
the
young
girl
could
not
sleep
well
now
short
feverish
snatches
of
slumber
were
followed
by
sudden
awakenings
and
fears
and
fancies
too
subtle
to
define
constantly
preyed
on
her
mind
sometimes
when
under
the
influence
of
a
religious
melancholy
that
often
took
possession
of
her
she
repeated
the
over
and
over
again
but
at
intervals
she
stopped
in
the
midst
of
a
prayer
started
as
if
stung
by
an
asp
and
exclaimed
what
does
the
virgin
think
of
me
me
that
has
committed
one
of
the
worst
mortal
sins
in
the
world
in
the
midst
of
a
prayer
she
dropped
to
sleep
maybe
for
the
third
time
in
an
hour
but
immediately
was
awakened
by
a
sharp
rapping
at
the
door
sheila
heard
nothing
she
lay
almost
inert
and
perspiring
a
little
who
s
there
norah
called
out
the
sanitary
a
hoarse
voice
answered
from
the
landing
the
girl
slipped
out
of
bed
hardly
daring
to
breathe
lest
her
companion
was
disturbed
fumbled
round
for
the
matches
lit
the
and
opened
the
door
two
strangers
in
uniform
stood
outside
one
a
tall
man
with
a
heavy
beard
held
a
lamp
the
other
a
shrunken
individual
hummed
a
tune
in
a
thin
monotonous
voice
and
picked
his
nose
with
a
finger
the
two
entered
brushing
against
the
girl
who
took
up
her
stand
behind
the
door
making
a
slight
rapping
noise
with
her
heels
on
the
bare
floor
how
many
here
asked
the
tall
man
with
the
beard
two
norah
answered
the
woman
in
the
bed
and
no
one
else
under
the
bed
no
one
norah
replied
but
the
man
knelt
on
the
floor
lifted
the
bedclothes
and
peeped
under
only
one
in
the
next
room
asked
the
fellow
pointing
at
meg
s
door
only
one
and
nobody
they
chose
not
to
believe
the
girl
s
statement
rapped
on
the
door
which
was
opened
after
a
long
delay
by
old
meg
who
had
risen
naked
from
bed
and
was
now
hiding
her
withered
body
behind
a
blanket
stamped
with
the
blue
lettering
the
sentence
stolen
from
james
moffat
ran
from
the
left
knee
to
the
right
shoulder
the
left
shoulder
was
bare
as
was
also
the
left
leg
from
ankle
to
hip
only
one
here
she
croaked
glowering
evilly
at
the
men
who
had
disturbed
her
slumber
christ
an
auld
body
has
no
peace
at
all
here
for
there
are
always
some
folk
crawlin
round
when
decent
folk
are
in
bed
bed
callin
it
a
bed
and
so
particular
about
it
one
would
almost
be
as
well
off
if
they
were
thrown
out
a
handful
of
fleas
and
allowed
to
sleep
on
the
doorstep
god

on

at
this
hour
of
the
night
to
pull
an

entered
the
room
his
companion
took
out

something
down
shut
the
book
and
placed
it
in
his
pocket
the
tall
man
came
out
again
both
bade
norah
in
apologetic
tones
and
took
their
leave
sheila
had
slept
unmoved
through
it
all
the
young
girl
closed
the
door
extinguished
the
light
and
the
bed
she
was
very
tired
but
sleep
would
not
come
to
her
eyes
an
hour
passed
sheila
was
snoring
loudly
but
norah
awake
could
hear
the
water
dropping
into
the
sink
on
the
landing
and
the
vacant
laugh
of
bessie
escorting
a
man
upstairs
at
night
this
woman
never
slept
her
business
was
then
in
full
swing
someone
knocked
at
the
door
again
and
norah
cried
who
s
there
is
this
no
enquired
a
man
s
voice
norah
answered
no
and
steps
shuffled
along
the
passage
outside
next
instant
the
crash
of
someone
falling
heavily
was
heard
then
a
muttered
imprecation
and
afterwards
silence
norah
fell
asleep
again

three
weeks
laggard
and
leaden
in

o

true
to

expression
of
pain

across

sheila
laying
down
her
scissors
and
stirring
up
the
fire
which
was
brighter
than
usual
ye
must
go
to
bed
now
and
keep
yerself
warm
child
ye
ll
be
all
right
come
the
mornin
i
m
very
unwell
sheila
i
feel
no
i
m
better
again
said
norah
making
a
feeble
attempt
to
smile
and
only
succeeding
in
blushing
she
undressed
to
her
white
cotton
chemise
lay
down
and
sheila
gathered
the
blankets
round
the
young
woman
with
tender
hands
norah
appeared
calm
her
fingers
for
a
moment
toyed
with
the
tresses
over
her
brow
then
she
drew
her
hand
under
the
blankets
her
face
had
taken
on
a
new
light
the
cold
look
of
despair
had
suddenly
given
place
to
a
new
and
nervous
interest
in
life
and
in
herself
it
seemed
as
if
things
had
assumed
a
new
character
for
her
as
if
she
understood
in
a
vague
sort
of
way
that
a
woman
s
life
is
always
woven
of
dreams
sorrow
love
and
she
was
now
waiting
almost
gladly
impatient
for
the
most
solemn
moment
in
a
woman
s
life
i
m
not
one
bit
afraid
she
said
to
the
serious
sheila
who
was
bending
over
her
now
don
t
be
frightened
one
would
think
norah
did
not
proceed
it
was
a
moment
of
words
and
the
listener
understood
suddenly
norah
sighed
deeply
clutched
sheila
s
dress
in
a
fierce
grip
and
closed
her
eyes
tightly
and
tensely
she
was
suffering
but
she
endured
silently
i
m
better
again
she
said
after
a
moment
don
t
heed
about
me
sheila
i
m
the
older
woman
went
back
to
her
work
with
the
large
shiny
scissors
and
the
bright
little
needle
only
the
of
the
cutting
shears
and
the
noise
of
a
falling
cinder
could
be
heard
for
a
long
while
on
the
roof
could
be
seen
rushing
together
forming
into
something
very
dark
and
breaking
free
again
will
ye
have
a
drop
of
tea
norah
no
sheila
said
the
girl
in
the
bed
in
a
low
strained
voice
then
after
a
moment
she
asked
sheila
will
ye
come
here
for
a
minute
a
cinder
fell
into
the
grate
with
a
sharp
rattle
the
scissors
sparkled
brightly
as
they
were
laid
aside
sheila
rose
and
went
towards
the
bed
on
tiptoe
i
m
not
needin
ye
yet
said
norah
i
thought
i
m
better
the
woman
went
back
to
her
work
stepping
even
more
softly
than
before
the
night
slipped
away
the
noises
on
stair
and
street
became
less
and
less
the
women
of
no
had
retired
to
their
beds
a
drunken
man
sang
homewards
a
policeman
passed
along
with
slow
solemn
tread
even
these
signs
of
life
suddenly
abated
and
the
noise
of
the
cutting
scissors
the
clock
striking
out
the
hours
and
the
wind
beating
against
the
window
were
all
that
could
be
heard
in
the
room
about
three
o
clock
the
sanitary
inspectors
called
sheila
whispered
to
them
at
the
door
and
they
went
away
muttering
something
in
an
apologetic
voice
the
grey
dawn
was
lighting
up
the
street
the
blind
had
been
drawn
aside
and
the
lamp
flickered
feebly
on
the
floor
sheila
turned
it
down
and
approached
the
bed
on
norah
s
face
there
was
the
calmness
of
resignation
and
repose
she
had
suffered
much
during
the
night
but
now
came
a
quiet
moment
her
brow
looked
very
white
and
her
cheeks
delicately
red
her
face
was
still
as
beautiful
as
ever
even
so
much
the
more
was
it
beautiful
there
s
great
noises
in
the
streets
sheila
she
said
to
the
woman
bending
over
her
tis
the
workers
goin
out
to
their
work
child
was
the
answer
how
are
ye
feelin
now
better
sheila
but
even
as
she
spoke
the
pain
again
mastered
her
and
she
groaned
wearily
and
sheila
wise
with
a
woman
s
wisdom
knew
that
the
critical
moment
had
come
ii
the
child
who
came
to
norah
the
little
boy
with
the
pink
plump
hands
the
fresh
cheeks
and
pretty
shoulders
filled
nearly
all
the
wants
of
her
heart
the
fear
that
she
had
had
of
becoming
a
mother
was
past
and
the
supreme
joy
of
motherhood
now
was
hers
she
knew
that
she
would
be
jealous
of
the
father
if
he
was
with
her
at
present
as
matters
stood
the
child
was
her
own
her
very
own
and
nothing
else
mattered
much
sometimes
she
would
sit
for
an
hour
her
discarded
scissors
hanging
from
her
fingers
gazing
hungrily
at
the
downy
face
of
the
child
anticipating
every
movement
on
its
part
following
every
quiver
of
its
body
with
greedy
eyes
in
the
child
lay
norah
s
hopes
of
salvation
it
was
the
plank
to
which
she
clung
in
the
shipwreck
of
her
eternity
all
her
hopes
all
her
fortunes
lay
in
the
babe
s
fragile
bed
the
sound
of
the
little
voice
was
heavenly
music
to
her
ears
in
norah
s
heart
welled
up
this
incomparable
love
in
which
are
blended
all
human
affections
and
all
hopes
of
heaven
the
love
of
a
mother
the
great
power
of
motherhood
held
her
proof
against
all
evils
dimly
and
vaguely
it
occurred
to
her
that
if
that
restraining
power
was
withdrawn
for
a
moment
she
would
succumb
to
any
temptation
and
any
evil
which
confronted
her
she
found
now
a
great
joy
in
working
with
sheila
both
talked
lovingly
of
home
and
those
whom
they
had
left
behind
sometimes
norah
mingled
tears
with
her
recollections
sheila
carrol
never
wept
years
ago
i
could
cry
my
fill
she
told
norah
but
for
a
long
while
save
on
the
night
yerself
came
here
the
wells
of
my
eyes
have
been
very
at
another
time
when
the
mother
was
giving
the
breast
to
the
child
sheila
said
ye
look
like
the
blessed
virgin
with
the
child
a
difficulty
arose
about
the
child
s
name
that
of
the
father
was
out
of
the
question
one
of
the
frosses
names
for
me
said
sheila
doalty
dony
or
dermod
murtagh
shan
or
fergus
oiney
eamon
or
hudy
ah
shure
there
s
hundreds
of
them
all
good
names
they
are
and
all
belonging
to
our
own
arm
of
the
glen
the
trouble
is
that
there
s
too
many
to
pick
from
we
ll
be
like
the
boy
with
the
apples
they
were
all
so
good
that
he
didn
t
know
what
one
to
take
and
he
died
of
fargortha
while
lookin
at
them
dermod
or
fergus
which
will
it
be
asked
the
beansho
dermod
said
norah
simply
i
thought
so
said
the
woman
and
i
hope
another
dermod
will
come
one
of
these
days
to
see
us
then
maybe
dermod
flynn
was
a
nice
kindly
lad
comely
and
chapter
xxviii
the
i
once
a
week
on
friday
sheila
took
a
bundle
of
finished
shirts
to
the
s
office
seven
months
after
norah
s
arrival
sheila
went
out
one
day
with
her
bundle
and
in
the
evening
the
woman
did
not
return
midnight
came
and
went
from
the
window
norah
watched
the
lazy
hands
of
the
clock
crawl
out
the
seconds
of
existence
steps
could
be
heard
coming
up
and
going
down
the
stairs
then
these
suddenly
ceased
far
away
the
flames
flaring
from
the
top
of
a
glowed
fiercely
red
against
the
dark
sky
a
policeman
came
along
the
dimly
lighted
street
walking
with
tired
tread
and
examining
the
numbers
on
the
closed
entrances
he
suddenly
disappeared
below
afterwards
a
knock
came
to
the
door
a
woman
was
run
down
by
a
said
the
policeman
speaking
through
his
heavy
moustache
when
norah
gave
him
admittance
she
was
killed
instantly
she
had
a
slip
of
paper
this
address
maybe
you
can
norah
lifted
the
sleeping
babe
wrapped
it
in
her
shawl
and
followed
the
man
at
the
police
mortuary
she
recognised
sheila
carrol
the
dead
woman
was
in
no
way
disfigured
she
lay
on
a
wooden
slab
face
upwards
and
still
so
very
still
sheila
carrol
she
s
only
sleepin
said
norah
sheila
carrol
you
say
said
a
uniformed
man
who
had
just
entered
and
who
overheard
norah
s
remark
twice
convicted
once
for
being
on
the
streets
once
for
child
neglect
he
muttered
looking
not
a
little
proud
of
his
knowledge
the
back
of
the
head
and
the
spine
that
s
hurt
when
one
is
struck
hard
in
them
places
it
s
all
norah
felt
like
a
cripple
whose
crutches
have
been
taken
away
that
night
when
she
returned
to
her
room
she
slept
none
and
wept
bitterly
at
times
believing
that
the
dead
woman
was
with
her
in
the
room
being
very
lonely
she
kept
the
light
burning
till
morning
and
as
the
fire
had
gone
out
she
shivered
violently
at
intervals
and
a
dry
tickling
cough
settled
on
her
chest
ii
the
merchant
who
supplied
cloth
to
the
two
women
had
gone
bankrupt
probably
sheila
was
so
much
overwhelmed
by
this
that
she
forgot
to
avoid
the
dangers
of
the
crowded
streets
on
her
way
home
perhaps
she
was
planning
some
scheme
for
the
future
and
as
is
the
case
when
the
mind
dwells
deeply
on
some
particular
subject
the
outside
world
was
for
a
while
to
her
an
of
the
tragedy
said
that
sheila
had
taken
no
heed
of
the
oncoming
tram
that
death
was
instantaneous
when
morning
came
norah
ryan
was
conscious
of
a
dull
sickly
pain
behind
her
left
the
child
slept
badly
during
the
night
and
coughed
feebly
when
it
awoke
there
were
no
matches
to
light
the
fire
a
a
pennyworth
of
tea
and
a
quarter
of
coal
was
all
that
remained
in
the
room
norah
went
into
meg
s
compartment
the
door
was
lying
open
the
woman
sat
by
a
dead
fire
having
just
awakened
from
a
drunken
sleep
on
the
floor
she
was
a
soul
generous
and
sympathetic
but
fond
of
drink
a
glass
of
whisky
made
her
very
tipsy
two
glasses
made
her
very
irritable
ye
re
up
early

said
the
old
woman
rising
to
her
feet
and
scratching
her
head
vigorously
is
sheila
sleepin
yet

exclaimed
old
meg
sitting
down
on
the
only
chair
in
the
room
and
raising
both
hands
palms
outwards
to
a
level
with
her
face
a
tram
struck
her
last
night
when
she
was
comin
home
said
norah
killed
at
once
the
policeman
said
that

meg
wept
loudly
for
a
few
moments

her

the
old
woman
it

yon
place
dust
flyin
all
over
the
place
dirty
rags
with
creepin
things
and
crawlin
things
and
maybe
diseases
on
them
it

a
foulsome
den
but
folks

child

for

thing

and
for

the
feelthy
place
would
kill
the
dear
little
thing
in
less
than
a
for
a
fortnight
following
norah
looked
in
vain
for
a
job
at
which
she
might
work
with
the
child
beside
her
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
old
woman
spoke
again
of
a
vacant
post
in
the
store
where
she
laboured
norah
put
the
child
out
to
twopenny
helen
a
stumpy
little
woman
with
very
large
feet
and
hacked
hands
then
applied
for
and
obtained
the
vacant
post
in
the
iii
in
the
chill
damp
air
of
the
early
morning
the
two
women
tramped
to
their
work
wearing
their
boots
to
save
the
tram
fare
the
old
woman
always
walked
with
her
head
down
humming
little
tunes
through
her
nose
and
breaking
into
a
run
from
time
to
time
her
long
red
tongue
was
always
out
slipping
backwards
and
forwards
over
her
upper
lip
her
hair
grey
as
a
dull
spring
morning
eternally
falling
into
her
eyes
and
her
arms
swinging
out
in
front
of
her
like
two
dead
things
as
she
trotted
along
the
opened
out
on
a
narrow
smelling
lane
the
office
where
a
few
collared
clerks
bent
over
grimy
ledgers
and
endless
rows
of
figures
was
on
a
level
with
the
street
the
place
where
the
women
sorted
the
rags
was
a
basement
under
the
office
there
were
in
all
thirty
human
machines
working
in
this
cellar
which
stretched
into
the
darkness
on
all
sides
save
one
and
there
it
now
and
again
touched
sunshine
the
weak
sunshine
that
streamed
through
a
dirty
cobwebbed
window
green
with
moisture
and
framed
with
iron
bars
all
day
long
two
flared
timidly
in
the
basement
spluttering
as
if
in
protest
at
being
condemned
to
burn
in
such
a
cavern
the
women
bowed
over
their
work
were
for
the
most
part
silent
all
topics
of
conversation
had
been
exhausted
long
ago
sometimes
monday
morning
was
lively
many
came
fresh
to
their
work
full
of
accounts
of
a
fight
in
which
half
the
women
of
the
close
joined
and
which
for
some
ended
in
the
for
others
with
battered
faces
and
dishevelled
hair
these
accounts
roused
a
certain
interest
which
lasted
a
few
hours
then
came
the
obstinate
dragging
silence
again
all
day
long
they
worked
together
in
the
murky
cavern
sorting
the
rags
the
smell
of
the
place
was
awful
suffocating
almost
the
damp
and
mouldy
rags
gave
forth
an
unhealthy
odour
dust
rose
from
those
that
were
drier
and
filled
the
place
and
the
throats
of
the
workers
each
woman
knew
every
wrinkle
of
her
neighbour
s
face
on
all
the
yellowish
white
and
almost
expressionless
faces
of
the
spectres
of
the
cellar
and
now
and
again
the
spectres
sang
their
which
died
away
in
the
lone
corners
of
the
basement
like
wind
in
a
churchyard
it
was
amongst
these
women
that
norah
started
work
a
new
start
exclaimed
one
a
little
thing
who
looked
as
if
she
had
been
gradually
drying
up
for
several
years
on
seeing
the
ye
ll
soon
get
the
blush
oot
o
yer
cheeks
here
lass
d
ye
know
that
there
are
only
three
people
in
the
worl
when
all
is
said
and
done
another
woman
called
to
norah
the
the
scavenger
and
the
are
the
three
folk
who
count
most
in
the
long
everybody
but
norah
laughed
at
this
remark
though
all
save
norah
had
heard
it
made
a
thousand
times
before
ah
lass
ye
ve
the
red
cheek
said
a
girl
of
seventeen
they
ll
soon
be
pale
enough
another
interrupted
and
such
white
teeth
they
ll
soon
be
yellow
and
such
long
hair
it
ll
soon
be
full
o
but
they
said
no
more
perhaps
because
norah
was
so
beautiful
and
beauty
calls
forth
respect
in
even
the
coarsest
people
the
new
start
had
many
troubles
at
first
being
new
to
the
work
and
unable
to
do
as
much
as
the
other
women
she
was
paid
only
five
shillings
a
week
after
a
while
the
natural
dexterity
of
her
fingers
stood
her
in
good
stead
and
she
became
more
adept
at
the
than
anyone
in
the
basement
therefore
her
companions
who
had
before
laughed
at
her
inexperience
became
jealous
of
norah
and
accused
her
of
trying
to
find
favour
with
the
boss
but
the
girl
did
not
mind
much
what
they
said
her
one
great
regret
was
in
being
separated
from
her
boy
for
the
whole
livelong
day
her
breasts
were
full
of
the
milk
of
motherhood
and
severance
from
the
little
child
was
one
of
the
greatest
crosses
which
she
had
to
bear
the
master
seldom
came
near
the
place
it
didn
t
agree
with
his
health
he
said
he
was
a
stout
man
with
small
glistening
eyes
overhung
with
heavy
red
brows
the
hairs
of
his
nostrils
reached
down
his
upper
lip
and
he
was
very
bald
when
the
women
saw
the
bald
head
appear
at
the
foot
of
the
basement
stairs
shining
a
little
as
the
gaslight
caught
it
they
whispered
there
s
the
full
moon
turn
yer
money
and
one
of
the
workers
who
was
very
fond
of
swearing
would
invariably
answer
there
s
not
much
money
in
the
pockets
o
them
that
s
workin
in
this
damned
hole
whenever
he
came
down
into
the
he
took
the
girl
to
one
side
and
spoke
to
her
about
something
the
two
seemed
to
be
on
very
familiar
terms
and
it
was
stated
that
the
girl
got
a
far
higher
wage
than
any
of
the
other
workers
ten
shillings
a
week
was
paid
to
her
some
hinted
suddenly
however
she
left
the
place
and
did
not
come
back
again
but
now
the
master
came
down
the
stairs
oftener
than
ever
before
one
evening
just
as
work
was
stopping
the
appeared
shone
for
a
moment
under
the
gaslight
then
came
forward
there
s
some
linen
rags
here
that
i
want
sorted
up
he
said
licking
his
lips
i
want
one
of
ye
to
stay
here
and
do
the
he
looked
round
as
he
spoke
and
his
eyes
rested
on
norah
who
was
wrapping
her
shawl
over
her
shoulders
will
ye
stay
here
he
asked
all
right
said
norah
and
took
off
her
shawl
again
the
rest
of
the
workers
went
upstairs
a
bit
envious
perhaps
of
the
girl
who
was
picked
out
for
special
work
in
the
fetid
hole
master
and
servant
were
left
alone
but
norah
wished
that
she
had
gone
away
with
the
rest
she
wanted
so
much
to
see
her
child
the
cough
which
the
little
boy
had
contracted
on
the
night
of
sheila
carrol
s
death
ten
months
before
had
never
gone
wholly
away
and
now
it
was
worse
than
ever
the
mother
herself
was
not
feeling
very
well
the
sharp
pain
in
her
chest
troubled
her
a
great
deal
at
night
ye
re
a
good
sorter
i
hear
said
the
master
licking
his
lips
and
norah
noticed
the
hairs
of
his
nostrils
quivering
as
if
touched
by
a
breeze
ye
ll
not
live
well
on
seven
shillin
s
a
week
will
ye
he
asked
one
must
live
somehow
said
norah
bending
down
and
picking
up
a
handful
of
rags
from
the
floor
and
a
few
shillin
s
goes
a
long
way
when
one
is
savin
she
started
even
as
she
spoke
for
a
large
soft
hand
had
gripped
her
wrist
and
she
looked
up
to
find
her
master
s
little
glistening
eyes
looking
into
hers
she
could
see
the
wrinkles
on
his
forehead
the
red
weal
that
the
rim
of
his
hat
had
left
on
the
temples
the
few
stray
hairs
that
yet
remained
on
the
top
of
the
pink
head
what
would
ye
be
wantin
with
me
she
asked
i
could
raise
yer
screw
say
to
ten
bob
a
week
said
the
man
slipping
his
arms
round
her
waist
and
trying
to
kiss
her
on
the
lips
if
one
of
the
dirty
rags
had
been
thrust
into
her
mouth
she
could
not
have
experienced
a
more
nauseous
feeling
of
horror
than
that
which
took
possession
of
her
at
that
moment
she
freed
herself
violently
from
the
grasp
of
the
man
seized
her
shawl
and
hurried
upstairs
leaving
him
alone
in
the
cellar
in
the
office
she
had
a
misty
impression
of
a
grinning
clerk
looking
at
her
and
passing
some
meaningless
remark
when
she
got
back
to
her
room
she
told
meg
of
all
that
had
happened
ye
re
a
lucky
lass
a
gie
lucky
lass
said
the
old
woman
enviously
just
play
yer
cards
well
and
ye
ll
soon
hae
a
pund
a
week
in
the
store
i
heard
about
the
bowdy
girl
that
left
us
a
month
gone
the
master
had
a
fancy
for
her
but
a
mistake
happened
and
she
was
in
straw
but
it
s
now
all
right
and
she
s
gettin
a
pund
a
week
just
ye
play
yer
cards
well
norah
ryan
and
ye
ll
have
a
gey
guid
time
she
added
meg
morraws
ha
ha
cried
the
old
woman
laughing
and
showing
her
yellow
stumps
of
teeth
worn
to
the
gums
that
s
the
way
to
act
carry
on
like
that
with
him
and
he
ll
do
onything
ye
ask
for
ye
re
a
comely
lass
a
gey
comely
one
often
i
wondered
why
ye
stayed
so
long
workin
in
the
life
could
be
made
muckle
easier
by
a
girl
wi
a
winnin
face
like
yours
norah
ryan
god
to
think
that
a
girl
like
ye
are
warkin
in
that
dirty
hole
when
ye
could
make
ten
times
as
muckle
siller
by
doin
somethin
else
iv
norah
did
not
go
back
to
the
she
took
her
child
from
twopenny
helen
and
looked
for
other
work
the
boy
with
his
round
chubby
legs
and
wonderful
pink
toes
which
she
never
tired
of
counting
was
a
wonder
and
delight
to
her
everything
was
so
fresh
about
him
the
radiant
eyes
the
red
cheeks
that
made
the
mother
so
much
long
to
bite
them
the
little
soft
lips
and
the
white
sharp
teeth
that
were
already
piercing
through
the
gums
the
child
was
dressed
poorly
but
as
befitted
a
sanctuary
before
which
one
human
being
prostrated
herself
with
all
the
unselfish
devotion
of
a
pure
heart
with
the
best
taste
of
the
worshipper
the
cold
which
the
child
caught
months
before
had
never
entirely
gone
away
whenever
the
cough
that
accompanied
it
seized
him
he
curled
up
in
his
mother
s
lap
in
agony
while
she
feared
that
the
little
treasure
that
she
loved
so
much
was
going
to
be
taken
away
the
thought
of
the
boy
dying
occurred
to
her
many
times
and
almost
shattered
the
springs
of
action
within
her
if
he
died
she
shuddered
in
terror
her
fear
was
somewhat
akin
to
the
fear
which
possesses
a
man
who
hangs
over
a
precipice
and
waits
for
the
overstrained
rope
to
break
if
the
child
was
gone
she
would
have
nothing
more
to
live
for
her
funds
were
very
low
when
she
left
the
she
had
only
the
sum
of
nineteen
shillings
in
her
possession
this
would
pay
rent
for
a
few
weeks
but
meanwhile
food
fuel
and
clothing
were
needed
what
was
she
to
do
then
followed
weary
days
searching
for
work
norah
went
from
house
to
house
in
the
better
parts
of
the
city
offering
herself
for
employment
she
left
the
child
lying
on
a
bed
on
the
floor
and
locked
the
place
up
she
no
longer
sent
it
out
to
twopenny
helen
norah
could
not
now
spare
twopence
a
day
again
she
got
work
this
time
finishing
dongaree
jackets
and
made
tenpence
a
day
she
had
now
to
work
on
sunday
as
well
as
saturday
and
she
usually
spent
eighteen
hours
a
day
at
her
task
winter
came
and
there
was
no
coal
the
child
whose
cold
got
no
better
was
placed
in
bed
while
the
mother
worked
the
dry
and
hacking
cough
shook
the
mother
s
frame
at
intervals
and
she
sweated
at
night
when
asleep
she
ate
very
little
her
breasts
were
sore
when
she
suckled
her
child
and
by
and
by
milk
refused
to
come
her
eyes
became
sore
she
now
did
part
of
her
work
under
the
lamp
on
the
landing
and
by
the
light
from
the
window
across
the
courtyard
old
meg
when
she
was
drunk
had
pence
to
spare
for
the
child
just
for
the
little
thing
to
play
wi
she
would
explain
in
an
apologetic
voice
as
if
ashamed
of
being
found
guilty
of
a
good
action
afterwards
she
would
add
ye
should
have
taken
the
twa
extra
shillin
s
a
week
when
they
were
offered
one
evening
towards
christmas
when
the
old
woman
was
speaking
thus
norah
asked
if
i
went
back
now
would
i
get
a
job
the
man
has
got
marrit
and
the
place
as
ye
know
yerself
has
been
filled
up
ages
and
ages
a
strange
expression
perhaps
one
of
regret
showed
for
a
moment
on
the
face
of
norah
ryan
chapter
xxix
dermod
flynn
i
when
the
old
woman
left
her
norah
sat
for
a
while
buried
in
thought
her
scissors
lying
on
one
knee
one
hand
hanging
idly
by
her
side
the
boy
was
very
ill
the
cough
hardly
left
him
for
a
moment
and
his
eyes
were
bright
and
feverish
if
he
dies
what
am
i
to
do
norah
asked
herself
several
times
then
it
would
be
that
i
d
have
nothing
to
live
she
rose
and
followed
meg
into
the
room
the
woman
sat
beside
the
fire
humming
an
old
song
a
candle
stuck
in
the
neck
of
a
was
alight
and
a
cricket
chirped
behind
the
fireless
grate
i
m
goin
out
for
a
while
said
norah
in
a
low
strained
voice
will
ye
look
after
the
boy
until
i
come
back
i
ll
take
him
in
all
right
said
the
woman
rising
to
her
feet
take
the
little
thing
when
norah
her
own
room
the
boy
was
coughing
weakly
but
insistently
in
the
darkness
she
lit
a
candle
sat
down
on
the
corner
of
the
bed
and
was
immediately
deep
in
thought
her
money
had
now
dwindled
away
she
had
only
one
and
threepence
in
her
possession
she
even
felt
hungry
for
a
long
while
this
sensation
was
almost
foreign
to
her
the
weekly
rent
was
due
on
the
morrow
and
the
child
needed
the
doctor
needed
food
needed
fresh
air
and
above
all
the
attention
which
she
was
unable
to
give
him
she
lifted
him
tenderly
from
the
bed
and
carried
him
in
to
meg
who
began
to
crow
with
delight
when
the
child
was
placed
in
her
withered
arms
once
back
in
her
own
room
norah
resumed
her
seat
on
the
bedside
and
seemed
to
be
debating
some
very
heavy
problem
the
candle
flared
faintly
in
the
sconce
on
the
floor
large
shadows
chased
one
another
on
the
grimy
ceiling
the
cripple
came
upstairs
norah
could
hear
the
rattle
of
his
crutches
the
noise
of
the
city
was
loud
outside
the
windows
norah
rose
swept
the
floor
lit
the
lamp
a
thing
which
she
had
not
done
for
many
nights
candles
being
much
cheaper
than
oil
she
went
out
bought
some
coal
and
a
penny
bundle
of
firewood
these
she
placed
on
the
grate
ready
for
lighting
the
bed
she
sorted
with
nervous
care
sighing
as
she
spread
out
the
blankets
and
arranged
the
pillows
she
then
began
to
dress
herself
carefully
brushing
back
her
hair
with
trembling
fingers
as
she
looked
into
the
little
broken
one
of
sheila
carrol
s
belongings
her
dress
still
retained
a
certain
coquetry
of
cut
and
suited
her
well
her
hat
which
she
had
not
worn
for
a
long
while
gave
an
added
charm
to
her
white
brow
and
grey
eyes
when
dressed
she
stood
for
a
moment
to
listen
to
the
child
coughing
in
meg
s
room
stifling
with
an
effort
the
impulse
to
go
in
and
have
one
look
at
the
boy
she
crossed
herself
on
forehead
and
lips
and
went
out
on
the
landing
for
a
moment
something
seemed
to
perplex
her
she
stood
and
looked
round
on
all
sides
the
place
was
deserted
nothing
could
be
heard
but
the
cripple
singing
annie
laurie
in
a
loud
melodious
voice
norah
again
crossed
herself
stepped
slowly
down
the
stairs
and
went
out
to
the
street
ii
at
midnight
she
returned
for
her
child
the
boy
was
still
coughing
but
more
quietly
than
before
and
the
old
woman
was
lying
flat
upon
her
stomach
asleep
by
the
fireside
norah
lifted
the
child
took
him
into
her
own
room
and
placed
the
frail
bundle
in
which
was
wrapped
up
all
her
life
and
all
her
hopes
on
the
bed
the
fire
was
burning
brightly
the
gave
out
a
clear
comforting
light
which
showed
up
the
whole
room
the
bare
floor
the
black
walls
enlivened
by
no
redeeming
feature
save
the
crude
picture
of
the
virgin
and
child
and
the
little
black
cross
hanging
from
a
rusty
nail
near
the
window
the
pile
of
dongaree
jackets
shoved
into
a
corner
the
and
the
bed
with
the
blankets
which
norah
had
sorted
such
a
short
time
before
now
in
strange
disorder
old
meg
suddenly
bustled
into
the
room
a
frightened
look
on
her
face
i
thought
that
some
yin
had
stolen
the
little
dear
she
cried
her
breath
reeking
with
alcohol
ah

is
the
wee
laddie

cooed
on
seeing
the
little
pink
face
in
the
bed
i

fright

hae

ryan
the
woman
sat
down
on
the
orange
box
and
looked
curiously
round
first
at
the
lighted
lamp
then
at
the
fire
then
at
norah
and
afterwards
back
to
the
fire
again

she
exclaimed
bending
down
and
lifting
a
cigarette
from
the
floor
she
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
then
threw
it
into
the
flames
has
it
come
to
this
norah
ryan
she
asked
and
a
faint
touch
of
regret
mingled
with
the
woman
s
tones
norah
who
was
bending
over
the
child
turned
round
fiercely
for
a
moment
she
looked
like
some
beautiful
animal
cornered
in
its
own
lair
it
has
come
to
this
meg
morraws
she
shouted

my

went
into
her
room
closing
the
door
softly
behind
her
norah
took
some
money
five
shillings
from
her
pocket
and
put
it
on
the
mantelpiece
under
the
picture
of
the
virgin
and
child
it
made
a
tinkling
sound
as
she
put
it
down
and
the
silver
coins
sparkled
brightly
then
she
turned
down
the
light
threw
some
more
coals
on
the
fire
and
taking
the
child
from
the
bed
she
sat
down
and
held
the
little
bundle
of
pink
flesh
against
her
bosom
she
could
hear
the
water
bubbling
from
the
tap
out
on
the
landing
the
noise
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
loud
vacant
laughter
from
no
why
did
those
women
laugh
norah
wondered
the
fire
blazed
brightly
and
as
she
raised
her

in
the
days
which
followed
norah
learned
much
which
may
not
be
written
down
in
books
sad
things
that
many
dare
not
read
but
which
some
under
the
terrible
tyranny
of
destiny
dare
to
endure
it
now
seemed
to
the
girl
that
all
freedom
of
action
all
the
events
of
her
life
had
been
irrevocably
decided
before
she
was
born
deep
down
in
her
heart
this
thought
lacking
expression
and
almost
undefined
was
always
with
her
she
bought
new
dresses
learned
the
art
of
making
every
curl
on
her
white
brow
look
tempting
and
every
movement
of
her
face
and
body
to
express
desires
which
she
did
not
feel
she
followed
up
her
new
profession
like
one
sentenced
to
death
with
reason
clogged
feeling
deadened
and
intellect
benumbed
as
an
alternative
to
this
there
was
nothing
but
starvation
and
death
and
even
purity
is
costly
at
such
a
price
dragged
to
the
tribunal
which
society
erects
for
the
prosecution
of
the
poor
and
pure
she
was
asked
to
renounce
all
that
she
cherished
all
her
hopes
her
virginity
her
soul
society
sated
with
the
labour
of
her
hands
asked
for
her
soul
and
society
being
the
stronger
had
its
demand
gratified
but
over
it
all
over
the
medley
of
pain
and
sorrow
over
the
blazing
crucible
of
existence
in
which
all
fair
dreams
and
hopes
of
the
woman
were
melted
away
greater
and
more
powerful
than
anything
else

that
crushed

things
would

went
out
into
the
city
on
her
usual
errand
she
had
now
known
the
life
of
the
streets
for
fully
two
months
it
was
nearly
midnight
the
streets
were
well
nigh
deserted
save
for
the
occasional
prowlers
and
drunken
men
who
were
coming
home
from
their
clubs
or
from
the
foul
haunts
of
the
city
as
she
walked
along
her
head
held
down
against
the
cutting
breeze
that
had
suddenly
risen
and
was
now
whirling
round
every
corner
she
heard
steps
coming
behind
her
and
in
these
steps
she
detected
something
strangely
familiar
for
a
moment
she
felt
like
a
wayfarer
who
goes
alone
along
a
dark
road
and
waits
for
some
horrible
apparition
to
stretch
out
from
the
darkness
and
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
the
steps
drew
nearer
came
closer
somebody
was
passing
her
norah
looked
up
started
a
little
and
cried
under
god
the
day
and
the
night
it
s
dermod
flynn
that
s
in
it
she
was
again
looking
at
dermod
flynn
he
stood
in
front
of
her
his
hand
stretched
out
in
welcome
is
this
you
norah
he
asked
the
crushing
fatality
of
her
years
pressed
down
upon
her
she
suddenly
realised
that
she
had
lost
something
very
precious
that
all
her
accidents
and
faults
were
bunched
together
and
now
laid
before
her
he
had
grown
so
big
too
a
man
he
looked
is
it
yerself
that
s
in
it
dermod
flynn
she
asked
i
didn
t
expect
to
meet
you
here
have
ye
been
away
home
since
i
saw
ye
last
she
thought
she
detected
a
wave
of
pity
sweeping
over
dermod
s
face
and
resting
in
his
eyes
i
have
never
been
at
home
yet
he
answered
have
you
me
go
home
she
replied
almost
defiantly
what
would
i
be
going
home
for
now
with
the
black
mark
of
shame
over
me
d
ye
think
that
i
d
darken
me
mother
s
door
with
the
sin
that
s
on
me
heavy
on
me
soul
sometimes
i
m
thinkin
long
but
i
never
let
on
to
anybody
and
it
s
meself
that
would
like
to
see
the
old
spot
again
it
s
a
good
lot
i
d
give
to
see

in
the

duskus
of
the

evenin
d
ye
mind
the
time
ye
were
at
school
dermod
and
the
way
ye
struck
the
master
with
the
pointer
i
mind
it
well
said
dermod
with
a
laugh
and
you
said
that
he
was
dead
when
he
dropped
on
the
and
d
ye
mind
the
day
that
ye
went
over
beyont
the
mountains
with
the
bundle
under
yer
arm
i
met
ye
on
the
road
and
ye
said
that
ye
were
never
comin
you
did
not
care
whether
i
returned
or
not
you
did
not
stop
to
bid
me
i
was
frightened
of
ye
answered
norah
who
noticed
that
dermod
spoke
resentfully
as
if
she
had
been
guilty
of
some
unworthy
action
why
were
ye
frightened
he
asked
i
don
t
and
you
did
not
even
turn
to
look
after
me
that
was
because
i
knew
that
ye
yerself
was
lookin
do
you
remember
the
night
on
the
derry
boat
dermod
asked
wistfully
quite
well
dermod
she
replied
i
often
be
thinkin
of
them
days
i
do
there
was
a
momentary
silence
norah
dreaded
the
next
question
which
instinctively
she
knew
dermod
would
ask
he
was
better
dressed
than
formerly
she
noticed
and
he
was
tall
and
strong
she
felt
that
he
was
one
in
whom
great
reliance
could
be
placed
where
are
you
going
at
this
hour
of
the
night
he
asked
and
norah
read
accusation
in
his
tones
i
m
goin
out
for
a
walk
she
answered
where
are
you
workin
how
much
does
he
know
norah
asked
herself
what
could
she
tell
him
that
she
was
a
servant
in
a
gentleman
s
house
but
even
as
the
lie
was
stammering
on
her
tongue
she
faltered
and
burst
into
tears
don
t
cry
said
the
young
man
awkwardly
is
there
what
s
wrong
with
ye
norah
she
did
not
answer
but
low
sobs
shook
her
bosom
how
much
she
wished
to
be
away
and
yet
how
she
liked
to
be
beside
him
surely
dermod
would
think
her
a
very
funny
girl
to
weep
like
that
a
momentary
remembrance
of
a
morning
long
ago
when
she
met
him
on
the
glenmornan
road
flashed
across
her
mind
and
she
held
out
her
hand
slan
agiv
dermod
she
said
in
a
choking
voice
i
must
be
goin
it
was
good
of
ye
to
speak
to
me
in
that
nice
way
of
yers
his
hand
closed
on
hers
but
he
did
not
speak
the
sound
of
footsteps
reached
her
ears
a
window
was
lifted
somewhere
near
at
hand
a
cab
rattled
on
the
streets
norah
withdrew
her
hand
and
went
on
her
journey
leaving
dermod
alone
on
the
pavement

to
all
souls
who
are
sensitive
to
moods

any

whether
joyful
or
sorrowful
there
comes
now
and
again
a
delicious
hour
when
it
is
not
night
and
no
longer
day
the
timid
twilight
gleams
softly
on
every
object
and
favours
a
dreamy
humour
that
weds
itself
as
if
in
a
dream
to
the
dim
play
of
light
and
shade
in
that
delightful
passage
of
time
the
mind
wanders
through
interminable
spaces
and
dwells
lovingly
on
vanished
hopes
broken
dreams
and
shattered
illusions
in
that
moment
a
soul
feels
the
wordless
pleasure
of
a
memory
that
drifts
lightly
by
a
memory
to
which
only
the
accents
of
the
heart
can
give
life
old
scenes
are
brought
up
again
and
are
seen
in
the
delightful
haze
of
transient
remembrance
there
are
waters
running
to
a
sea
waves
sobbing
on
a
shore
voices
speaking
softly
and
low
and
trees
waving
like
phantoms
to
a
wind
that
is
merely
the
ghost
of
a
wind
in
these
dreams
there
is
a
joyful
melancholy
a
placid
acceptance
of
sorrow
and
happiness
that
might
have
only
been
realities
of
an
earlier
existence
of
long
past
years
an
hour
like
this
came
to
norah
ryan
one
evening
as
she
sat
in
her
room
waiting
for
a
fight
to
come
to
an
end
on
the
landing
outside
the
soldier
who
had
just
returned
from
prison
and
found
another
man
in
company
with
one
of
his
loves
was
now
blackening
the
man
s
eyes
norah
knew
that
she
would
be
molested
when
passing
outside
she
chose
to
wait
until
the
storm
was
over
she
was
dressed
ready
to
go
out
old
meg
had
taken
charge
of
the
child
the
fight
was
still
in
full
swing
a
fire
burned
dimly
in
the
grate
at
which
norah
sat
a
frail
blue
fleeting
flame
flared
nervously
for
a
moment
amongst
the
red
tongues
of
fire
then
faded
away
the
blind
was
drawn
across
the
window
but
the
lamp
had
not
been
lighted
yet
norah
sat
on
the
floor
looking
into
the
glowing
embers
her
chin
delicately
rounded
resting
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
her
long
tapering
fingers
touching
a
little
pink
ear
that
was
almost
hidden
under
her
soft
wavy
tresses
the
faintest
flush
mantled
her
cheeks
her
brow
seen
in
the
of
the
room
looked
doubly
white
and
her
long
lashes
sank
languidly
from
time
to
time
over
her
eyes
norah
s
thoughts
were
far
away
they
had
crossed
the
bridge
of
many
years
and
roved
without
effort
of
will
over
the
shores
of
her
own
country
again
she
lived
the
life
of
a
child
the
life
she
had
known
in
her
earlier
years
the
air
was
full
of
the
scent
of
the
peat
the
sound
of
the
sea
the
homesick
song
of
the
streams
babbling
out
their
plaints
as
they
hurried
to
the
bosom
of
their
restless
mother
the
ocean
it
was
evening
the
sun
barely
a
hand
s
breadth
over
the
horizon
coloured
the
waters
of
the
bar
and
the
sea
beyond
amber
crimson
and
dun
the
curraghs
of
frosses
were
putting
out
from
the
shore
the
men
hurried
along
the
strand
waving
their
arms
and
moving
their
lips
but
making
no
sound
fergus
was
there
and
her
father
wrinkled
and
bearded
the
neighbours
and
the
women
and
children
who
came
down
to
the
beach
to
see
the
people
off
to
the
fishing
one
dream
blended
with
another
it
was
morning
the
sun
tipped
the
hills
and
lighted
glenmornan
strips
of
gold
in
the
clouds
of
the
east
were
drawn
fine
as
the
wrinkles
on
the
brow
of
a
woman
a
mist
rose
from
the
holms
of
frosses
and
the
water
of
the
streams
sparkled
merrily
in
the
pools
trout
were
leaping
breaking
the
glassy
surface
and
raising
a
shower
of
rainbow
mist
that
dissolved
in
the
air
a
boy
came
along
the
road
there
was
a
smile
on
his
face
and
his
eyes
were
full
of
dreams
as
the
eyes
of
a
youth
who
goes
out
to
push
his
fortune
well
may
be
in
one
hand
he
carried
a
stick
in
the
other
a
bundle
dermod
flynn
was
setting
out
for
the
hiring
fair
of
strabane
ii
so
norah
ryan
dreamt
one
vision
merging
into
another
and
all
bringing
a
peace
to
her
soul
she
did
not
hear
the
first
rap
at
the
door
nor
the
second
the
third
knock
louder
and
more
imperative
than
the
others
roused
her
to
a
sense
of
her
surroundings
in
the
fabric
of
her
existence
the
black
thread
of
destiny
again
reappeared
and
she
rose
pushed
back
the
erring
lock
of
hair
from
her
white
forehead
placed
some
more
coal
on
the
fire
turned
up
the
lamp
and
lit
it
then
went
and
opened
the
door
a
young
man
dressed
in
sailor
s
garb
his
face
cut
and
covered
with
blood
stood
on
the
threshold
behind
him
on
the
ground
lay
a
prostrate
figure
the
man
with
the
empty
sleeve
come
in
said
norah
she
did
not
look
at
the
visitor
all
men
were
the
same
now
to
her
all
were
so
much
alike
the
sailor
rubbed
a
handkerchief
over
his
face
staggered
past
the
girl
and
sank
into
a
chair
what
s
that
swine
doin
he
cried
strikin
a
man
an
before
the
mast
without

of
women
but

and

he
called
to
the
woman
at

door

staggered
to
his
feet
on
the
landing
and
swore
himself
along
the
passage
norah
closed
the
door
he
s
up
on
his
feet
and
away
to
his
own
room
she

sailor

but
is
this
house
one
like
no
the
then

said
the
sailor
who
was
still
busy
with
his
face
i
heard
tell
of
no
out
abroad
i
m
an
you
know
before
the
mast
on
half
the
seas
of
the
world
i
met
a
sailor
who
was
here
not
here
but
at
no
ah
he
had
great
stories
of
the
place
so
i
said
that
i
d
come
here
too
if
ever
i
came
to
glasgow
damn
that
pig
he
almost
blinded
me
did
the
beggar
but
i
gave
one
to
him
on
the
jowl
that
he
ll
not
forget
where
can
i
wash
my
face
on
the
landing
norah
told
him
and
handed
the
man
a
towel
he
went
out
and
washed
presently
he
and
norah
took
stock
of
him
he
was
dressed
in
sailors
garb
his
eyes
were
hazy
from
intoxication
one
of
his
hard
and
knotted
hands
was
tattooed
on
the
back
his
dark
and
heavy
moustache
was
draggled
at
both
ends
and
a
red
scar
on
his
right
showed
where
the
soldier
had
hit
him
he
was
young
probably
not
over
thirty
years
of
age
he
sat
down
again
d
ye
know
what
it
is
he
exclaimed
striking
his
fist
heavily
against
his
knee
a
woman
of
yer
kind
may
be
as
good
as
most
and
better
than
many
i
always
say
that
always
some
of
them
may
be
bad
but
for
the
others
he
banged
his
fist
again
against
his
knee
and
paused
as
if
collecting
words
for
an
emphatic
finish
to
his
sentence
others
are
as
good
as
pure
gold
he
concluded
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
as
if
deep
in
thought
then
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
girl
come
here
and
sit
on
my
knee
he
said
she
sat
down
on
his
knee
and
laughed
but
her
laugh
was
forced
and
hollow
ye
re
unhappy
said
the
man
looking
at
her
fixedly
and
stroking
his
face
with
his
hand
don
t
say
that
ye
aren
t
for
i
know
that
ye
are
ye
ll
be
new
at
this
game
maybe
d
ye
belong
to
glasgow
i
ye
talk
like
an
irish
my
father
was
ah
that
explains
it
said
the
man
i
m
irish
ye
are
ye
exclaimed
norah
with
a
start
i
am
that
said
the
man
why
do
ye
jump
like
ye
do
maybe
ye
re
frightened
of
me
maybe
it
s
yer
first
time
at
this
work
the
girl
made
no
answer
her
cheeks
were
scarlet
and
she
felt
as
if
she
could
burst
into
tears
but
stifled
bravely
the
sob
that
rose
to
her
throat
don
t
be
frightened
of
me
said
the
man
we
sailors
are
a
rough
lot
at
times
but
we
respect
beauty
so
to
speak
my
god
ye
re
a
soncy
lookin
wench
new
to
this
kind
of
life
as
well
he
paused
and
what
s
this
he
cried
glancing
at
the
virgin
s
picture
and
the
little
black
crucifix
he
turned
to
the
girl
and
saw
that
a
tear
which
she
hastily
tried
to
brush
away
was
rolling
down
her
cheek
ye
re
a
catholic
too
he
said
in
a
milder
voice
it
s
damned
hard
luck
i
myself
am
a
catholic
at
least
i
was
born
one
but
now
i
m
well
i
m
nothin
a
catholic
feels
it
most
i
ve
always
said
that
one
may
find
women
a
great
lot
worse
than
women
than
a
woman
like
yerself
the
ladies
that
can
gorge
themselves
at
table
when
ye
have
to
do
the
likes
of
this
for
a
livin
are
more
guilty
of
yer
sin
than
ye
are
yerself
ye
know
i
m
a
bit
drunk
not
much
wrong
with
me
though
for
i
can
see
things
clearly
if
i
m
a
bit
groggy
twas
mostly
the
fault
of
that
swine
but
i
forgive
him
i
m
an
advanced
thinker
what
is
yer
name
i
mean
yer
real
name
it
s
rarely
that
an
irishman
calls
his
children
by
names
unbeknown
in
his
own
country
sit
closer
there
ye
re
a
nice
girl
i
like
yer
brow
it
s
so
white
and
yer
lips
they
re
so
pretty
now
give
me
a
kiss
it
s
nice
to
have
a
girl
like
yerself
on
my
knee
i
m
three
sheets
in
the
wind
but
i
like
ye
i
m
an
advanced
thinker
and
i
ve
read
oh
ever
so
much
darwin
huxley
have
ye
ever
heard
of
these
men
never
norah
answered
who
are
they
they
are
the
great
minds
of
the
world
they
are
the
men
who
proved
that
there
was
no
heaven
and
no
but
there
is
a
god
if
there
is
why
do
ye
suffer
like
this
because
i
m
ha
ha
laughed
the
man
how
funny
how
very
funny
ye
are
a
child
and
god
would
feel
honoured
if
ye
allowed
him
to
lace
yer
shoes
if
ye
kept
very
good
and
pure
he
might
let
ye
to
heaven
when
ye
died
but
would
he
give
ye
a
pair
of
shoes
in
there
s
no
god
kiss
me
again
by
heaven
if
ye
weren
t
so
good
lookin
and
so
temptin
i
d
be
generous
i
d
go
down
on
my
knees
and
salute
ye
as
a
representative
of
sufferin
womankind
and
then
go
away
feelin
honoured
if
ye
only
allowed
me
to
kiss
your
hand
but
ye
are
so
winsome
i
should
like
ye
to
be
always
pure
but
why
do
men
like
purity
in
a
woman
they
like
it
so
that
they
can
take
it
away
so
that
they
can
kill
that
which
they
love
but
what
am
i
talkin
about
anyway
i
m
drunk
not
so
much
just
three
sheets
in
the
wind
or
so
i
can
see
things
clearly
i
m
a
learned
man
and
i
know
things
bein
a
great
traveller
and
a
worker
on
half
the
docks
in
the
world
and
a
sailor
too
before
the
mast
i
am
i
ve
seen
things
in
my
time
many
things
most
of
them
unjust
very
unjust
it
s
seven
years
since
i
left
home
think
of
that
yer
father
came
from
ireland
ye
say
what
part
of
the
country
did
he
come
from
i
don
t
know
said
norah
in
a
low
voice
i
never
asked
him
what
part
of
ireland
did
ye
come
from
i
said
that
it
is
an
unjust
world
a
danged
unjust
world
said
the
man
pressing
her
tightly
and
kissing
her
and
in
ireland
ye
see
more
injustice
than
can
be
seen
anywhere
in
half
the
world
i
ve
seen
women
and
girls
in
ireland
working
for
a
penny
a
day
they
were
knittin
socks
and
they
had
to
travel
miles
for
the
yarn
aye
and
to
cross
an
arm
of
the
sea
that
took
them
to
their
breasts
in
the
height
of
winter
too
with
the
snow
fallin
and
the
sleet
ah
if
yerself
had
suffered
such
hardships
ye
wouldn
t
live
to
tell
the
tale
and
children
too
had
to
go
out
into
the
cold
black
water
my
sister
a
very
little
girl
just
about
that
size
the
sailor
held
out
his
hand
about
two
feet
from
the
ground
used
to
work
fourteen
hours
a
day
when
she
was
but
twelve
and
her
pay
was
sevenpence
ha
penny
a
week
the
hanged
little
thing
and
she
wasn
t
that
size
but
i
ve
made
some
money
salvage
ye
know
and
i
m
goin
to
make
my
sister
a
lady
when
i
go
back
to
donegal
she
was
such
a
nice
wee
girl
wouldn
t
it
be
fine
if
girls
always
kept
young
i
think
of
my
sister
now
as
i
left
her
not
grown
up
at
all
ye
too
are
a
nice
lass
so
different
from
those
i
ve
seen
in
the
far
corners
of
the
what
is
yer
name
asked
norah
in
a
tremulous
whisper
but
she
knew
his
name
recognised
her
brother
fergus
saw
in
his
face
that
indescribable
individuality
which
distinguishes
each
face
from
all
others
in
the
world
with
tense
strained
look
she
waited
for
the
answer
to
her
question
iii
fergus
ryan
of
frosses
in
the
county
donegal
replied
the
sailor
banging
his
fist
against
the
corner
of
the
chair
fergus
ryan

before
the
mast

ve
sailed

a
lot

york
and
melbourne
i
ve
seen
all
those
places
aye
and
nearly
all
the
countries
of
the
world
ah
and
i
ve
come
across
a
lot
of
trouble
fighting
and
all
the
rest
of
it
two
times
a
knife
was
left
stickin
in
me
more
than
once
i
was
washed
into
the
sea
ah
i
could
tell
ye
things
about
other
places
if
i

what

wrong
with
ye
ye

scared
but
ye
re
not
afraid
of
sailors
are
ye
they
re
all
decent
fellows
honest
though
a
little
careless
at
times
my
god
what
s
comin
over
ye
ye
re
goin
to
faint
norah
had
suddenly
become
heavy
in
the
man
s
arms
the
hand
which
he
held
contracted
tightly
and
a
sickly
pallor
overspread
her
countenance
jean
cried
the
sailor
staring
at
the
girl
with
a
puzzled
expression
jean
that
s
not
yer
name
but
it
doesn
t
matter
ye
aren
t
afraid
of
sailors
are
ye
they
re
rough
fellows
most
of
them
but
good
at
heart
has
a
man
never
told
ye
before
that
he
got
stuck
in
the
ribs
with
a
knife
women
here
know
nothin
but
in
calcutta
what
am
i
talkin
about
anyhow
jean
waken
up
the
man
rose
unsteadily
and
bearing
the
senseless
girl
in
his
arms
he
approached
the
bed
and
laid
her
down
carefully
sorting
with
clumsy
fingers
the
stray
tresses
on
her
brow
as
he
did
so
then
seizing
a
glass
that
stood
on
the
mantelpiece
he
rushed
out
and
filled
it
with
water
from
the
tap
on
the
landing
he
came
in
held
norah
up
in
his
arms
and
pressed
the
glass
to
her
lips
she
opened
her
eyes
drink
this
said
the
sailor
what
else
can
i
do
to
help
ye
leave
me
to
myself
said
the
girl
go
away
and
leave
me
at
once
now
she
sat
upright
in
bed
and
freed
herself
from
his
arms
the
glass
fell
to
the
floor
and
broke
with
a
musical
tinkle
the
water
splashed
brightly
and
formed
into
little
wells
on
the
planking
the
sailor
put
his
hands
between
his
belt
and
trousers
and
gazed
placidly
at
the
girl
now
that
is
too
bad
he
said
speaking
slowly
too
dashed
bad
all
sailors
are
decent
fellows
at
heart
only
now
and
then
they
tell
stories
about
their
wild
life
all
that
i
said
about
the
knifing
was
just
a
i
haven
t
mind
of
what
ye
said
norah
replied
in
a
whisper
then
in
a
louder
voice
go
away
do
go
away
and
leave
me
to
i
m
not
goin
now
he
said
in
a
voice
of
reproof
i
can
not
go
it
s
impossible
i
ve
plenty
of
money
look
he
pulled
a
handful
of
gold
from
his
pocket
my
god
i
can
not
leave
ye
now
i
can
not
why
do
ye
want
me
to
go
away
norah
looked
at
the
picture
of
the
virgin
and
shuddered
as
if
something
had
stung
her
suddenly
it
came
to
her
that
fate
had
done
its
worst
that
evil
and
unhappiness
had
reached
their
supreme
climax
she
looked
hard
at
her
brother
a
fixed
and
almost
defiant
look
in
her
eyes
her
lips
set
in
a
line
why
do
ye
want
me
to
go
away
he
repeated
because
i
m
yer
sister
norah
the
one
that
wouldn
t
be
grown
up
when
ye
went
she
felt
a
grim
unnatural
satisfaction
in
repeating
the
man
s
words
and
strangely
enough
her
voice
was
wonderfully
calm
i
made
a
mistake
and
it
was
all
my
own
fault
this
is
how
i
m
livin
now
a
common
woman
of
the
streets
now
go
away
and
leave
me
to
myself
fergus
i
m
grown
up
ye
re
my
sister
ye
re
norah
said
the
man
as
the
girl
freed
herself
almost
reluctantly
from
his
arms
he
stepped
backwards
paused
as
if
he
wanted
to
say
something
approached
the
door
fumbled
for
a
moment
with
the
knob
and
went
out
on
the
stairway
he
stood
as
if
trying
to
collect
his
thoughts
where
am
i
he
muttered
it
used
to
be
red
creepin
things
before
and
besides
i
m
not
very
drunk
at
present
not
more
than
three
sheets
but

picture
of
the
blessed
virgin
that
was
funny
fergus

bit

but
what

mother

children

that
way
before
i
ll
go
up
he
reached
the
top
and
tried
to
push
the
door
open
it
did
not
budge
he
put
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
and
heard
sobs
smothered
as
if
by
a
hand
very
near
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
norah
was
weeping
that
s
my
sister
he
whispered
hoarsely
looking
down
he
saw
the
light
shining
through
the
splintered
door
a
cavity
through
which
he
might
pass
his
fist
lay
open
before
him
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
took
out
several
pieces
of
gold
and
shoved
them
into
the
room
then
turned
down
the
stairs
and
hurried
out
into
the
crowded
streets
iv
at
the
end
of
an
hour
he
found
himself
sitting
on
a
capstan
by
the
river
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
he
could
not
tell
how
he
had
gotten
there
his
brain
was
throbbing
dizzily
and
myriad
little
red
and
blue
spots
danced
before
his
eyes
the
place
was
very
dark
the
sickly
light
of
the
few
lamps
along
the
river
did
not
light
more
than
a
dozen
yards
around
them
on
the
deck
of
a
near
boat
a
sailor
walked
up
and
down
stamping
his
feet
noisily
and
whistling
a
popular
tune
overhead
a
few
stars
glimmered
soberly
a
smell
of
pitch
was
in
the
air
a
boat
loosened
from
her
moorings
was
heading
downstream
about
fifty
paces
back
from
the
wharf
a
opened
out
on
the
river
dark
forms
stood
at
the
bar
arms
were
waving
in
discussion
and
hoarse
voices
could
be
heard
distinctly
against
the
garish
light
the
smallest
perpendicular
object
was
outlined
in
black
now
and
again
a
fist
banged
on
a
table
and
the
glasses
raised
a
silvery
tinkle
of
protest
against
the
striker
a
woman
came
out
of
the
place
and
went
on
her
way
along
the
street
reeling
from
side
to
side
and
giving
utterance
to
some
incoherent
song
the
water
lapped
against
the
wharf
a
little
wind
wailed
past
fergus
ears
he
rose
stretched
his
arms
took
a
cigarette
from
his
pocket
but
threw
it
away
when
it
was
lighted
it
s
lonely
here
but
in
the
pub
a
man
may
forget
things
he
said
i
wish
to
heaven
i
could
think
of
anything
but
it
i
ll
try
and
forget
it
but
it
s
hard
danged
hard
if
i
had
a
fight
i
d
forget
for
a
moment
at
least
what
i
have
just
seen
my
sister
norah
and
once
i
struck
a
sailor
because
he
said
that
no
girl
was
as
good
as
i
made
out
my
sister
to
be
a
whore
my
god
a
whore
i
ll
go
ver
to
the
pub
and
get
drunk
mad
drunk
what
matters
now
i
ll
not
go
home
i
ll
never
go
home
thrusting
his
hands
under
his
belt
he
crossed
the
street
entered
the
and
called
for
a
glass
of
whisky
at
the
bar
his
face
was
haggard
and
the
palms
of
both
his
hands
were
bleeding
i
ve
driven
my
nails
into
them
he
said
aloud
and
looked
round
angrily
those
who
were
staring
at
him
turned
away
their
eyes
renewed
their
conversation
and
raised
their
glasses
to
their
lips
with
evident
unconcern
fergus
lifted
his
liquor
and
swallowed
all
at
one
gulp
the
same
again
he
shouted
to
the
and
lit
another
cigarette
no
not
the
same
gi
me
a
schooner
and
a
stick
g
in
it
god
damn
ye
what
are
ye
starin
at
the
who
was
examining
fergus
attentively
made
no
reply
but
emptied
out
the
liquor
hastily
for
a
moment
fergus
was
deep
in
thought
suddenly
rousing
himself
he
struck
the
counter
a
resounding
blow
with
his
fist
ripping
his
knuckles
on
the
woodwork
and
causing
everybody
in
the
room
to
look
round
then
he
swallowed
his
drink
and
went
towards
the
door
with
his
hand
on
the
handle
he
looked
back
i
m
sorry
for
kickin
up
a
noise
he
said
he
passed
out
the
ray
of
light
from
the
door
showed
him
staggering
across
the
street
towards
the
quay
once
there
he
sat
down
on
the
capstan
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
brought
out
a
fistful
of
money
he
raised
it
over
his
head
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
he
was
going
to
throw
it
into
the
water
however
he
kept
hold
of
it
and
returned
to
the
pub
where
he
purchased
a
of
whisky
he
placed
a
sovereign
on
the
counter
and
went
out
without
his
change
ten
o
clock
passed
then
eleven
fergus
ryan
paced
up
and
down
the
quay
his
hands
deep
down
under
his
belt
and
the
bottle
in
his
pocket
the
air
was
now
moist
and
cold
a
smell
of
rotting
wood
pervaded
the
place
and
the
water
under
the
wharf
was
wailing
fitfully
the
mooring
ropes
of
the
nearest
vessel
strained
tensely
on
the
capstan
and
the
giant
vessel
seemed
eager
as
a
stabled
colt
to
get
out
away
and
free
i
would
like
to
know
where
that
boat
is
goin
when
she
sails
fergus
said
but
instantly
his
thoughts
turned
to
something
else
he
pulled
out
his
watch
and
looked
at
it
would
anyone
know
a
new
day
if
the
clocks
did
not
chime
he
asked
himself
in
a
puzzled
way
i
suppose
not
it
ll
soon
be
here
the
new
day
there
the
clocks
are
beginnin
damn
them
damn
them
if
it
had
been
anyone
but
my
sister
why
did
she
come
to
scotland
landlord
priest
and
that
mckeown
livin
on
her
earnin
s
i
suppose
she
ll
send
home
money
even
now
and
some
of
it
ll
go
to
the
priest
to
buy
crucifixes
and
pictures
of
the
virgin
and
some
of
it
to
the
landlord
to
buy
flounces
for
his
wife
and
some
will
go
to
farley
mckeown
i
was
goin
to
pay
a
surprise
visit
and
i
was
livin
on
that
goin
home
for
a
long
while
ah
but
the
world
is
out
at
elbow
and
i
m
drunk
he
stuck
both
his
hands
under
his
belt
again
and
approached
the
edge
of
the
wharf
three
dark
forms
slunk
out
of
the
shadows
and
drew
in
on
the
sailor
only
when
they
were
beside
him
did
anything
warn
him
of
danger
he
looked
round
into
the
face
of
the
soldier
whose
loose
sleeve
was
fluttering
in
the
wind
ah
ye
swine
fergus
exclaimed
and
struggled
with
the
belt
which
prisoned
his
hands
but
the
three
men
were
on
top
of
him
and
the
effort
was
futile
in
an
instant
he
was
flung
outwards
and
dropped
with
a
splash
into
the
water
that
seemed
to
rise
and
meet
him
as
he
fell
it
was
as
cold
as
ice
and
the
belt
held
taut
despite
his
efforts
to
break
free
he
had
a
moment
to
wonder
why
did
he
want
to
drown
me
he
asked
himself
his
mouth
filled
and
he
swallowed
he
was
now
going
down
head
first
but
slowly
he
made
another
effort
to
free
his
hands
but
was
unsuccessful
then
he
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
and
consciousness
began
to
ebb
from
him
he
felt
that
he
had
forgotten
something
that
was
very
important
not
to
himself
but
to
somebody
else
then
came
complete
darkness
and
the
book
of
life
as
man
knows
it
was
closed
forever

i
the
light
on
the
mantelpiece
grew
faint
flickered
and
was
going
out
the
wick
short
and
draggled
no
longer
reached
the
oil
the
fire
died
down
and
only
one
red
spark
could
be
seen
glowing
in
the
white
ashes
twelve
of
the
clock
struck
out
slowly
and
wearily
as
if
the
chimes
were
tired
of
their
endless
toil
on
the
floor
beside
the
door
a
pile
of
sovereigns
scattered
broadcast
glowed
bright
even
under
the
dying
light
the
figure
on
the
black
crucifix
showed
very
white
save
where
the
daub
of
red
paint
told
of
the
saviour
s
wounded
side
norah
sat
on
the
bare
floor
one
leg
stretching
out
her
hands
clasped
tightly
round
the
knee
of
the
other
which
was
almost
drawn
up
to
her
chin
action
was
clogged
within
her
a
terrible
black
monotony
was
piled
around
and
above
her
a
silence
not
even
broken
by
sighs
had
taken
possession
of
the
girl
old
meg
rapped
at
the
door
many
times
before
norah
heard
her
then
she
rose
poured
some
oil
into
the
lamp
and
turned
up
the
light
afterwards
not
because
she
wanted
to
but
because
she
was
desirous
of
hiding
from
everybody
that
which
had
taken
place
within
the
room
during
the
last
few
hours
she
lifted
the
gold
pieces
and
stuffed
them
into
the
pocket
of
her
dress
norah
ryan
norah
ryan
the
old
woman
was
crying
outside
the
door
a
dim
hazy
thought
of
all
the
good
things
which
the
gold
would
buy
for
her
child
crossed
norah
s
mind
as
she
opened
the
door
the
little
fellow
has
taken
a
turn
the
old
woman
said
as
she
stepped
inside
and
looked
curiously
round
of
late
norah
s
compartment
had
had
a
curious
interest
for
her
how
many
times
each
night
between
the
hours
of
six
and
twelve
did
she
come
to
the
door
and
listen
to
all
that
was
going
on
inside
i
thought
that
ye
d
never
hear
she
said
i
was
knockin
and
knockin
he
ll
soon
be
better
now
norah
said
in
a
voice
so
tensely
strained
that
it
caused
the
listener
to
look
at
her
with
surprise
i
can
now
pay
for
doctors
dresses
everything
d
ye
hear
that
meg
morraws
the
last
sentence
sounded
like
a
threat
the
child
was
doubled
up
on
meg
s
bed
and
perspiring
freely
the
old
woman
had
put
on
a
fire
that
was
now
blazing
merrily
i
had
twa
stanes
of
coal
and
i
put
them
all
on
because
of
the
kid
said
the
woman
have
ye
a
penny
and
i
ll
get
some
oil
there
s
not
a
drop
in
the
house
and
i
m
clean
norah
handed
the
woman
a
sovereign
and
told
her
to
keep
it
meg
ejaculated
a
grunt
of
surprise
made
a
remark
about
the
shops
being
closed
promptly
discovered
that
she
really
had
some
oil
and
put
the
coin
in
her
pocket
the
night
wore
on
the
child
breathing
heavily
and
coughing
lay
in
meg
s
bed
one
little
hand
showing
over
the
blue
lettered
sentence
on
the
blanket
the
light
burned
fretfully
the
old
woman
remarked
that
the
oil
was
mixed
with
water
and
that
she
had
got
poor
value
for
her
money
norah
talked
of
removing
the
child
into
the
other
room
meg
said
it
would
be
madness
and
scraping
up
more
coal
heaped
it
on
the
fire
in
the
morning
the
old
woman
intended
to
get
very
drunk
in
the
pub
outside
a
clatter
was
heard
on
the
stairs
then
the
sound
of
a
falling
body
throbbed
through
the
building
meg
went
out
and
found
a
man
the
soldier
asleep
on
the
landing
she
bent
down
fumbled
with
the
man
s
coat
discovered
a
bottle
of
whisky
drank
and
returned
the
bottle
to
the
sleeper
s
pocket
she
entered
the
room
again
smacking
her
lips
threw
herself
down
by
the
fire
and
started
to
weep
in
a
little
while
she
fell
asleep
she
woke
instinctively
at
eight
o
clock
the
hour
when
the
taverns
were
opening
and
rising
to
her
feet
she
rubbed
her
eyes
vigorously
with
her
fingers
she
found
norah
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
one
hand
pressed
tightly
against
her
knee
one
resting
lightly
on
the
head
of
the
child
are
the
pubs
open
yet
asked
meg
then
in
a
lower
voice
i
mean
is
the
child

the
dear
little
thing
he
s

said
norah
quietly
he
died
over
an
hour

exclaimed
the
woman
and
why

t

i
m
a
bad
yin
norah
ryan
a
gey
bad
yin
saying
these
words
the
woman
approached
the
bed
and
for
a
moment
stared
fixedly
at
the
child
then
she
paced
backwards
across
the
room
sobbing
loudly
and
muttering
meaningless
words
under
her
breath
through
the
dirty
window
she
could
see
the
opposite
the
doors
were
open
and
a
young
man
in
was
taking
off
the
shutters
my
heart
is
wae
for
ye
norah
said
the
old
woman
death
is
a
hard
thing
to
bear
but
i
suppose
it
ll
come
to
all
of
us
yin
day
oh
oh
and
all
of
us
maun
gang
some
day
i
m
goin
oot
the
noo
she
suddenly
exclaimed
stopping
in
her
walk
and
looking
very
serious
as
if
she
had
remembered
something
very
important
i
ll
be
back
again
in
a
meenit
or
meg
tied
her
shawl
over
her
head
and
without
washing
her
face
went
out
and
became
speedily
drunk
the
young
man
with
the
white
shirt
who
took
down
the
shutters
made
some
sarcastic
remarks
about
meg
s
dirty
face
and
meg
being
lifted
an
empty
bottle
and
flung
it
in
the
man
s
face
wounding
him
terribly
a
policeman
was
called
in
and
the
woman
was
hurried
off
to
the
noon
saw
norah
ryan
still
sitting
on
the
bedside
her
brother
s
gold
jingling
in
her
pocket
whenever
she
moved
and
her
dead
child
lying
cold
and
silent
beside
her
ii
a
month
of
black
sorrow
passed
by
there
was
a
great
void
in
norah
s
heart
a
void
which
could
never
be
filled
up
every
morning
she
rose
from
bed
knowing
that
the
day
would
have
no
joy
no
consolation
for
her
life
was
almost
unendurable
never
was
despair
so
overpowering
so
terrible
nothing
but
the
loneliness
of
the
future
existed
for
her
now
that
terrible
future
from
which
she
recoiled
as
a
timid
animal
recoils
from
the
brink
of
a
precipice
she
had
suffered
so
much
was
healed
a
little
now
the
healing
salve
of
motherhood
was
wrenched
from
her
by
the
hand
of
death
nothing
now
remained
to
the
girl
but
regrets
terrible
torturing
lingering
regrets
that
tore
at
her
mind
like
birds
of
prey
no
matter
what
i
do
now
nobody
will
think
me
no
worse
than
i
am
she
cried
but
the
thought
left
her
unmoved
even
life
did
not
interest
her
enough
to
have
any
desire
to
end
it
shame
had
once
covered
her
enveloped
her
as
in
a
garment
but
now
shame
was
gone
she
had
thrust
it
away
and
even
the
blind
trust
in
some
unshapen
chance
which
had
once
been
hers
was
now
hers
no
longer
she
worked
no
more
only
once
was
she
roused
to
action
and
that
was
when
she
looked
at
the
gold
coins
in
her
pocket
this
was
fergus
money
and
she
had
often
wondered
where
he
had
gone
to
on
that
night
of
nights
she
went
to
a
neighbouring
and
sent
ten
pounds
home
to
her
mother
not
a
line
not
a
word
went
with
the
money
order
i
m
dead
dead
to
everyone
she
said
to
me
own
mother
to
fergus
to
all
the
good
people
in
the
wide
iii
she
was
coming
back
from
the
and
the
loneliness
weighed
heavily
upon
her
she
thought
of
the
letter
on
its
way
to
her
own
country
soon
the
little
slip
of
paper
would
be
in
the
old
home
would
be
pressed
by
her
mother
s
fingers
and
she
poor
little
suffering
norah
would
still
be
hemmed
up
in
her
narrow
room
for
all
the
world
just
like
a
bird
prisoned
in
its
cage
hearing
nothing
but
the
vacant
laughter
and
sound
of
scurry
and
scuffle
on
the
stairs
and
streets
and
seeing
nothing
but
the
filthy
lanes
the
smoky
sky
and
the
misery
and
squalor
of
the
fetid
cowcaddens
she
went
into
a
and
purchased
a
bottle
of
whisky
that
night
she
got
drunk
and
even
happy
but
the
happiness
was
one
of
forgetfulness
she
awoke
from
a
heavy
sleep
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
lit
her
lamp
then
her
eyes
fell
on
the
picture
of
the
virgin
the
holy
water
stoup
the
little
black
crucifix
and
the
white
christ
with
extended
arms
and
bleeding
breast
nailed
upon
it
i
ve
prayed
to
ye
for
years
she
cried
clutching
the
picture
of
the
virgin
in
her
hand
and
look
at
me
it
s
little
good
me
prayers
has
done
me
me
a
drunkard
and
everything
that
s
worse
nor
another
so
speaking
she
flung
the
picture
into
the
dead
fire
a
spiral
of
ashes
rose
slowly
fluttered
round
and
settled
on
the
floor
she
brought
down
the
holy
water
stoup
and
resisting
with
a
shudder
the
desire
bred
of
long
custom
to
cross
herself
emptied
the
contents
into
the
fireplace
then
she
looked
at
the
confidant
of
her
innumerable
vague
longings
the
crucifix
sorrow
she
laughed
did
ye
ever
know
what
a
mother
s
sorrow
for
her
dead
child
was
that
s
the
sorrow
the
sorrow
that
would
make
me
commit
the
sins
the
most
awful
in
the
whole
world
but
what
am
i
saying
it
s
me
that
doesn
t
know
all
the
meanin
of
many
things
if
the
people
at
home
the
master
at
school
the
priest
any
one
at
all
had
learned
me
all
the
things
that
every
girl
should
know
i
wouldn
t
be
here
now
like
something
lost
on
a
moor
on
a
black
she
went
back
to
her
bed
leaving
the
light
burning
and
the
crucifix
standing
on
the
little
shelf
she
wondered
why
she
had
not
thrown
it
into
the
fire
as
she
intended
to
do
and
wondering
thus
she
fell
into
a
deep
and
drunken
slumber
iv
she
awoke
early
dressed
and
went
down
the
stairs
into
the
street
it
was
sunday
solitary
and
silent
with
a
slight
shower
of
snow
falling
glasgow
looked
drearier
than
usual
with
its
grimy
houses
and
the
wet
roofs
its
dirty
miry
streets
where
the
snow
dissolved
as
soon
as
it
fell
norah
s
spirits
were
in
sympathy
with
the
sombre
surroundings
and
she
felt
glad
that
the
oppressive
noise
of
the
had
abated
heedless
of
direction
she
walked
along
and
was
passing
a
catholic
chapel
when
the
worshippers
who
had
been
to
early
mass
showered
upon
her
it
was
too
late
to
turn
back
she
walked
hurriedly
through
the
crowd
feeling
that
every
eye
was
turned
in
her
direction
someone
said
they
re
goin
back
to
ireland
norah
looked
at
the
speaker
then
to
the
crowd
at
which
he
pointed
it
was
a
party
of
irish
workers
now
numbering
about
thirty
in
all
and
a
few
stragglers
were
still
coming
out
to
swell
the
ranks
a
young
girl
with
very
clear
skin
and
beautiful
eyes
was
putting
her
rosary
one
with
a
shiny
cross
at
the
end
of
it
into
her
pocket
an
old
woman
with
a
black
shawl
over
her
head
was
brushing
the
snow
from
her
hair
her
face
was
brown
and
very
wrinkled
the
few
hairs
that
fell
over
her
brow
were
almost
as
white
as
the
snow
that
covered
her
shawl
a
young
priest
in
cassock
and
gown
came
out
smiling
broadly
it
s
early
in
the
year
for
snow
he
said
looking
at
the
one
may
expect
anything
at
this
season
of
the
year
yer
reverence
said
the
old
woman
with
the
white
hair
the
young
girl
looked
closely
at
the
priest
hanging
on
every
word
that
he
uttered
are
you
all
goin
across
home
this
winter
asked
the
priest
all
of
us
said
a
man
you
like
the
old
country
enquired
the
priest
well
may
we
answered
the
old
woman
it
s
our
own
norah
was
moving
away
the
last
words
came
to
her
like
an
echo
our
own
country
norah
repeated
half
aloud
every
word
coming
slowly
through
her
lips
but
i
have
no
country
at
all
no
country
he
s
a
nice
kind
priest
indeed
he
is
speakin
to
them
just
as
if
they
were
his
own
people
i
would
like
to
go
and
confess
me
sins
to
that
priest
the
snow
fell
faster
and
presently
norah
felt
cold
a
fit
of
coughing
seized
her
and
the
sharp
pain
which
seldom
went
away
from
her
left
began
to
trouble
her
acutely
she
turned
and
went
back
to
her
room
all
that
evening
two
pictures
kept
rising
in
her
mind
one
was
of
the
priest
with
the
smiling
face
talking
to
the
the
other
was
the
picture
of
the
young
girl
with
the
clear
skin
and
the
beautiful
eyes
putting
the
rosary
with
the
shiny
cross
at
the
end
of
it
into
her
pocket
chapter
xxxii
confession
i
a
week
passed
the
hour
was
twelve
o
clock
on
a
saturday
night
the
clocks
were
striking
midnight
but
the
streets
were
still
crowded
with
people
a
boat
could
be
heard
hooting
on
the
broomielaw
a
train
whistling
at
enoch
street
station
a
woman
came
along
a
narrow
lane
on
the
cowcaddens
shouldering
her
way
amongst
the
people
and
abusing
in
no
polite
terms
those
who
obstructed
her
way
she
wore
a
shawl
almost
torn
to
shreds
and
she
staggered
a
little
as
she
walked
her
features
were
far
from
prepossessing
dry
hacks
dented
her
cheeks
and
brow
her
lips
were
rough
and
almost
bloodless
and
wisps
of
draggled
hair
hung
over
her
face
as
she
walked
along
she
broke
into
snatches
of
song
from
time
to
time
under
the
gaslight
staring
eyes
set
in
sickly
or
swarthy
faces
glared
at
her
rude
remarks
and
meaningless
jokes
were
made
sounds
of
laughter
rose
echoed
and
died
away
suddenly
a
noise
loud
as
a
rising
gale
swept
through
the
lane
a
man
hurried
past
and
rushed
along
the
streets
a
young
girl
followed
the
crowd
as
if
actuated
by
one
common
impulse
scurried
past
the
woman
yelling
and
shrieking
a
drunken
man
stared
stupidly
after
the
mob
then
fell
like
a
wet
sack
to
the
pavement
a
labourer
struck
against
the
prostrate
body
fell
and
rose
cursing
a
whistle
was
blown
the
slops
the
slops
a
ragged
youth
shouted
and
a
hundred
voices
took
up
the
cry
run
run
others
roared
a
little
toddling
child
stood
on
the
pavement
crying
one
finger
in
its
mouth
and
its
big
curious
eyes
fixed
on
the
rabble
what
are
ye
greetin
for
asked
the
woman
in
the
ragged
shawl
have
ye
lost
yerself
i
want
me
mither
wailed
the
child

here
are
ye
cried
a
stout
woman
ambling
up
and
seizing
the
infant
who
was
trying
to
chew
a
penny
which
the
stranger
had
just
given
it
it
s
a
lass
that
s
fainted
on
the
pavement
explained
the
mother
pointing
to
the
crowd
i

the
corner
boys
rascals
that
they
are
were
playin
tricks
on
that
s
always
the
way
with
people
said
the
strange
woman
see
and
don
t
let
the
child
swallow
the
with
these
words
she
hurried
into
the
press
of
people
the
corners
of
her
shawl
fluttering
round
her
a
group
of
ragged
men
and
women
stood
on
the
pavement
chattering
noisily
against
the
wall
a
frail
form
was
propped
up
between
two
young
girls
one
of
whom
had
a
frightened
look
on
her
face
the
other
was
smiling
and
chewing
an
orange
a
man
lighting
a
pipe
and
sheltering
the
match
under
the
palm
of
his
hand
made
some
suggestion
as
to
what
should
be
done
but
nobody
paid
any
heed
the
woman
with
the
torn
shawl
elbowed
her
way
through
the
crowd
and
came
to
a
standstill
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
girl
propped
up
on
the
pavement
it
s
norah
ryan
she
exclaimed
that
s
the
name
a
female
in
the
crowd
said
she
lives
up
she
s
a
woman
of
the
kind
that
but
ye
ken
what
i
and
ye
d
let
her
die
here
wi
out
givin
a
hand
to
help
her
cried
the
turning
fiercely
on
the
speaker
help
me
to
take
the
lass
to
her
the
two
girls
assisted
by
two
men
helped
the
woman
to
carry
norah
upstairs
the
crowd
followed
pressing
in
and
shoving
against
those
in
front
someone
made
a
rude
remark
and
the
laughter
which
greeted
it
floated
far
up
even
to
the
topmost
landing
where
the
paralysed
beggar
somewhat
the
worse
for
liquor
was
singing
one
of
his
cheery
songs
ii
the
accident
to
norah
happened
in
this
way
after
seeing
the
irish
diggers
come
out
of
the
chapel
she
felt
a
sudden
desire
to
go
and
confess
her
sins
to
the
young
priest
this
desire
she
did
not
strive
to
explain
or
analyse
she
only
knew
that
she
would
be
happy
in
some
measure
if
she
went
to
the
chapel
again
the
memory
of
her
sins
began
to
trouble
her
how
many
they
had
been
she
thought
from
that
night
when
a
ring
sparkled
in
the
darkness
outside
morrison
s
farmhouse
up
till
now
when
she
was
a
common
woman
of
the
streets
what
a
life
she
had
led
with
her
mind
aspiring
towards
heaven
she
became
conscious
of
the
mire
in
which
her
feet
were
set
the
religion
of
childhood
was
now
making
itself
heard
in
the
heart
of
the
woman
nature
had
given
norah
a
power
peculiarly
her
own
that
enabled
her
to
endure
suffering
and
in
turn
counselled
resignation
but
that
power
was
now
gone
she
required
something
to
lean
against
and
her
heart
turned
to
the
faith
of
which
the
little
black
crucifix
on
the
mantelpiece
was
the
emblem
on
the
saturday
evening
following
her
meeting
with
the
she
went
to
confession
she
entered
the
chapel
her
shawl
drawn
tightly
over
her
head
and
almost
concealing
her
face
which
looked
fair
white
and
childlike
seen
through
the
of
the
large
building
although
she
tried
to
walk
softly
her
boots
made
a
loud
clatter
on
the
floor
and
the
echo
caught
the
sound
and
carried
it
far
down
through
nave
and
chancel
a
few
candles
little
white
ghosts
with
halos
of
feeble
flame
around
their
heads
threw
a
dim
light
on
the
golden
ornaments
of
the
altar
and
the
figure
of
the
christ
standing
out
in
bold
relief
against
the
darkness
over
the
sacristy
door
the
sanctuary
lamp
hanging
from
the
roof
and
swaying
backwards
and
forwards
showed
like
a
big
red
eye
outside
the
confessional
a
number
of
men
and
women
were
seated
on
long
forms
one
or
two
were
kneeling
their
rosaries
clicking
as
the
beads
ran
through
their
fingers
those
seated
with
eyes
sparkling
brightly
whenever
they
turned
their
heads
looked
like
spirits
an
old
man
was
shuffling
uneasily
his
nailed
boots
rasping
on
the
floor
from
time
to
time
a
woman
having
been
seized
with
the
hiccough
rose
and
went
out
and
the
row
on
the
seat
gathered
closer
each
no
doubt
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
getting
in
advance
of
at
least
one
other
sinner
norah
sat
down
at
the
end
of
the
row
a
strange
fluttering
in
her
heart
and
her
fingers
opening
and
closing
nervously
she
felt
that
the
penitents
knew
her
that
they
would
arise
suddenly
and
accuse
her
of
her
sins
a
man
opposite
looked
fixedly
at
her
and
she
hung
her
head
the
low
mumbling
voice
of
the
priest
saying
the
words
of
absolution
over
a
sinner
could
be
heard
coming
from
the
confessional
but
had
there
ever
been
a
sinner
as
bad
as
she
was
norah
asked
herself
for
her
sins
it
was
so
hard
to
ask
forgiveness
never
never
will
i
get
absolution
she
said
under
her
breath
then
she
began
to
wonder
if
the
young
priest
who
talked
to
the
was
in
the
confessional
he
would
not
be
hard
on
her
he
looked
so
kind
and
gentle
i
m
afeared
very
afeared
she
whispered
to
herself
i
ll
not
go
in
this
time
i
ll
go
away
and
come
back
but
even
as
she
spoke
the
woman
with
the
hiccough
came
back
and
took
up
her
position
on
the
end
of
the
seat
norah
found
that
she
could
not
get
away
now
without
disturbing
the
woman
she
bowed
her
head
and
began
to
pray
iii
she
could
not
see
the
priest
in
the
confessional
but
could
hear
him
breathing
in
short
laboured
pants
like
a
very
fat
old
woman
it
couldn
t
be
the
young
man
norah
thought
as
she
went
down
on
her
knees
and
began
the
the
priest
hurried
over
the
words
in
a
weary
voice
norah
repeated
them
after
him
stopping
now
and
again
to
draw
her
breath
a
sensation
almost
akin
to
that
which
precedes
drowning
gripped
her
throat
what
sins
have
ye
committed
asked
the
priest
tell
me
the
greatest
i
am
a
woman
of
the
she
had
now
taken
the
plunge
and
felt
calmer
as
she
waited
to
be
asked
a
question
god
s
merciful
said
the
priest
and
his
voice
was
tinged
with
interest
go
i
am
the
mother
of
a
child
that
died
but
was
never
christened
said
norah
it
was
all
through
my
own
you
haven
t
been
married
no
said
the
girl
with
a
shudder
i
often
thought
of
takin
my
own
i
took
to
drink
and
then
threw
the
picture
of
the
blessed
virgin
and
a
stoup
of
holy
water
into
the
she
paused
ye
ve
given
up
the
life
of
the
streets
enquired
the
priest
in
a
voice
teeming
with
curiosity
i
have
answered
norah
did
ye
like
it
the
answer
was
the
echo
of
a
whisper
almost
god
s
merciful
said
the
priest
his
tones
seemed
hoarse
with
the
passion
of
a
sensuous
youth
and
yer
other
sins
he
asked
iv
she
prayed
for
a
long
time
before
the
altar
mingling
tears
with
her
prayers
footfalls
came
and
went
but
nobody
paid
any
heed
to
the
kneeling
woman
of
this
she
was
glad
norah
wanted
to
do
good
as
other
people
commit
evil
actions
secretly
the
trembling
shadows
thrown
by
the
sanctuary
lamp
played
round
the
christ
who
with
outstretched
hand
stood
over
the
sacristy
door
how
great
and
serious
the
saviour
looked
the
girl
imagined
that
he
was
thinking
of
some
great
secret
belonging
to
humanity
but
hidden
so
deeply
that
it
was
unknown
to
man
at
ten
o
clock
she
returned
to
her
room
and
sat
there
for
a
long
while
a
great
peace
had
stolen
into
her
soul
a
peace
that
was
mingled
with
no
regrets
she
had
forgotten
the
pain
in
her
shoulder
forgotten
everything
but
the
figure
of
the
christ
over
the
sacristy
door
and
the
hand
that
was
held
out
above
her
head
as
if
in
blessing
it
was
near
midnight
when
she
went
out
to
buy
provisions
for
the
next
day
the
hooligans
at
the
street
corner
were
very
drunk
and
very
noisy
there
were
no
policemen
about
a
fight
some
distance
off
was
engaging
their
attention
ah
here
s
one
that
ll
hae
some
siller

wench
shouted
one
of
the
roughs
a
big
rascal

my
pretty

fork

roared
the
rest
of
the
gang
in
chorus
norah
stood
undecided
one
foot
in
the
gutter
one
on
the
pavement
the
grocer
s
shop
was
a
dozen
paces
away
the
cops
will
be
here
in
a
jiffy
someone
shouted
in
a
tense
whisper
search
her
then
followed
a
wild
rush
and
norah
was
conscious
of
many
things
in
the
next
few
minutes
the
air
seemed
suddenly
charged
with
the
fumes
of
alcohol
hands
seized
her
rough
fingers
fumbled
at
her
blouse
opened
it
and
rested
on
her
breasts
a
whistle
was
blown
she
fell
to
the
pavement
got
dragged
for
a
few
paces
on
the
wet
street
and
was
pulled
to
her
feet
again
someone
laid
hands
on
her
purse
and
took
it
out
a
scramble
ensued
then
a
fight
for
the
money
norah
was
thrown
down
again
and
trampled
upon
the
hooligans
tore
the
purse
and
several
coins
fell
to
the
ground
a
second
whistle
was
blown
and
the
crowd
disappeared
leaving
norah
lying
in
a
dead
faint
on
the
pavement
v
when
she
recovered
consciousness
she
was
in
her
own
room
lying
on
the
bed
the
lamp
was
lit
and
she
could
hear
the
coal
crackling
in
the
fire
she
raised
herself
up
in
bed
and
looked
enquiringly
around
a
stranger
a
woman
who
was
bending
over
the
fire
hurried
forward
and

and
quietly
and
she
fell

times

incoherent

deep
slumber

i
in
the
morning
norah
was
in
a
raging
fever
she
spoke
in
her
delirium
of
many
things
prattling
like
a
child
about
the
sea
and
curraghs
of
frosses
going
out
beyond
trienna
bar
in
the
grey
dusk
of
the
harvest
evening
she
held
conversation
with
people
visible
to
none
but
herself
with

with
her

with
the

the

thus
disclosed

went
the
patient

no
better
a
doctor

called
in

applied
his
stethoscope
to
norah
s
chest
and
shook
his
head
gravely
well
asked
ellen
eagerly
i
ll
come
again
said
the
doctor
and
his
tones
implied
that
this
was
a
very
important
announcement
meanwhile
and
he
gave
ellen
instructions
as
to
how
she
should
treat
the
patient
money
was
scarce
norah
had
lost
every
penny
of
hers
on
the
night
that
the
hooligans
attacked
her
the
other
woman

only
shillings
in
her
possession
and
this
went
very
quickly

the
jew
who
was
to
some
extent
a
judge
of
character
and
who
was
kindly
disposed
towards
the
woman
having
heard
much
that
was
good
about
her
five
per
he
added
that
s
extra
good
when
the
doctor
came
the
next
day
ellen
spoke
to
him

the

such
protestations

he
was
a
kindly
man

my
best
for

he
said
and
as

the
doctor
looked
at
the
woman
and
knew
that
she
was
speaking
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
ii
another
fortnight
and
the
tang
of
spring
was
in
the
air
ellen
had
procured
work
as
a
charwoman
in
a
large
school
and
being
a
good
reliable
worker
several
smaller
jobs
came
her
way
her
wages
now
amounted
to
nine
shillings
a
week
norah
had
recovered
a
little
the
cough
was
not
as
hard
as
formerly
the
pain
under
her
left
had
lost
its
sting
but
though
hardly
noticeable
it
was
always
there
at
first
ellen
found
it
difficult
to
induce
norah
to
stop
in
bed
the
girl
wanted
to
get
about
and
do
some
work
only
when
she
got
to
her
feet
did
norah
become
fully
conscious
of
the
weakness
in
her
legs
and
spine
as
she
lay
there
in
her
narrow
bed
she
could
discern
through
the
cracked
window
the
sky
always
sombre
grey
and
covered
with
low
sagging
clouds
now
and
again
she
could
see
a
homing
crow
fly
past
on
lazy
wings
or
perhaps
a
white
turning
sharply
far
up
in
the
sky
with
a
glint
of
sunshine
resting
on
its
distended
wings
and
often
on
a
clear
night
when
the
moonbeams
filtered
through
the
ragged
blind
norah
would
dream
of
frosses
and
the
sea
the
old
home
with
the
moon
rising
over
the
hills
of
glenmornan
and
lighting
up
the
coast
of
donegal
i
have
been
a
great
trouble
to

norah
said
one
evening
turning
round
in
the
bed
and
looking
earnestly
at
her
friend

seem
to
be
only
a
trouble
to

little
minit

reminiscently
i

cry
vera
guid
but
she

my

i
kept
pure
for
a
long
while
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
didna
think
it
worth
it
in
the
end
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
sorted
a
piece
of
cloth
to
fit
on
the
dress
she
was
patching
at
eighteen
that
s
a
gey
guid
wheen
of

in
my
heid
that

religious
and

upliftin
to

and
last

the
streets

a
man
with
a
barrow

i
thought
that

from
it
the
catholic
church

to
read
the
bible
said
norah

ye
anything
that

iii
ellen
laid
down
her
scissors
trimmed
the
wick
of
the
lamp
resumed
her
seat
wetted
her
thumb
and
began
to
turn
over
the
pages
of
the
volume
here
it
is
she
said
and
commenced
to
read
in
a
low
voice
and
early
in
the
morning
he
came
again
into
the
temple
and
all
the
people
came
unto
him
and
he
sat
down
and
taught
them
and
the
scribes
and
pharisees
they
were
a
kind
of
people
that
lived
in
them
days
norah
brought
unto
him
a
woman
taken
in
who
committed
a
bad
sin
and
when
they
had
set
her
in
the
midst
they
say
unto
him
master
this
woman
was
taken
when
she
was
sinnin
in
the
very
act
now
moses
in
the
law
commanded
us
that
such
should
be
stoned
but
what
sayest
thou
this
they
said
temptin
him
that
they
might
have
to
accuse
him
but
jesus
stooped
down
and
with
his
finger
wrote
on
the
ground
as
though
he
heard
them
not
so
when
they
continued
asking
him
he
lifted
up
himself
and
said
unto
them
he
that
is
without
sin
amongst
you
let
him
first
cast
a
stone
at
her
and
again
he
stooped
down
and
wrote
on
the
ground
and
they
which
heard
it
being
convicted
by
their
own
conscience
went
out
one
by
one
beginning
at
the
eldest
even
unto
the
last
and
jesus
was
left
alone
and
the
woman
standing
in
the
midst
when
jesus
had
lifted
up
himself
and
saw
none
but
the
woman
he
said
unto
her
woman
where
are
those
thine
accusers
hath
no
man
condemned
thee
she
said
no
man
lord
and
jesus
said
unto
her
neither
do
i
condemn
thee
go
and
sin
no
tears
showed
in
ellen
s
eyes
when
she
finished
reading
then
without
giving
norah
time
to
speak
she
went
on
with
her
own
story
i
gave
up
the
life
on
the
streets
for
twa
and
twa
for
nearly
four
months
norah
then
my
mither
took
ill
and
was
like
to
dee
i
nursed
her
for
a
long
while
then
the
siller
gaed
awa
and
hunger
came
in
its
place
i
had
never
learnt
ony
trade
there
was
only
one
thing
to
be
done
norah
i
went
oot
tae
the
streets
again
oot
to
sin
knowingly
and
what
was
before
an
ignorant
lassie
s
mistake
was
then
and
after
a
fault
black
in
the
eyes
of
ellen
paused
and
looked
up
at
the
roof
perhaps
she
was
again
seeing
herself
as
she
was
on
that
evening
long
ago
a
wistful
and
pretty
girl
a
child
almost
going
out
into
the
streets
to
earn
the
money
that
would
buy
food
and
clothing
for
her
ailing
mother
i
came
back
the
next
morn
greetin
a
wee
if
i
remember
right
and
twa
pieces
of
gold
in
my
pocket
when
i
came
into
our
room
i
found
my
mither
lyin
on
her
chair
by
the
fire
and
she
was
dead

said
norah
in
a
low
voice
ye
had
a
hard
time
of
it
from
the
beginnin
hard
s
not
the
word
cried
ellen
and
a
fierce
look
came
into
her
eyes
it
was
damnable
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
when
the
two
women
felt
rather
than
thought
as
in
a
dream
they
could
hear
crowds
passing
like
tides
along
the
narrow
lane
outside
will
god
ever
forgive
us
for
our
sins
asked
norah
ye
have
never
ceased
to
be
pure
in
the
sight
of

of

accordin
to

sufferin

we
needna

muckle
fear
that
s
the
way
i
look
at
things
norah
and
ellen
taking
up
her
scissors
restarted
her
work
a
smile
almost
angelic
in
its
sadness
playing
in
odd
little
waves
over
her
face
and
in
the
poor
woman
s
soul
glowing
brighter
even
in
misfortune
burned
that
divine
and
primary
spark
which
evil
and
accident
could
never
extinguish
chapter

longings
i
time
wore
on
and
norah
lived
for
the
most
part
in
a
world
of
fancy
spoke
to
imaginary
individuals
and
at
moments
addressed
ellen
as
sheila
carrol
or
as
maire
a
glan
sometimes
she
was
gloomy
and
reserved
made
folds
in
the
sheet
murmured
in
an
almost
inaudible
voice
and
seemed
to
be
calculating
distances
the
least
movement
of
the
left
arm
pained
her
and
caused
her
to
groan
aloud
now
and
again
her
eyes
were
dull
heavy
and
glassy
at
other
times
they
were
and
sparkled
like
stars
she
ate
next
to
nothing
wrinkles
formed
round
her
eyes
her
cheeks
were
sunken
she
became
the
shadow
the
ghost
of
her
former
self
after
a
while
the
name
of
dermod
flynn
entered
into
her
prattle
at
first
she
spoke
of
him
eventually
she
spoke
to
him
as
if
he
were
in
the
room
when
her
mind
resumed
its
normal
state
all
this
was
forgotten
once
ellen
spoke
to
her
of
dermod
flynn
i
would
like
to
see
him
again
just
once
norah
said
then
added
i
m
a
to
ye
ellen
to
everybody
that

ever
met
i
m
like
a
little
useless
wean
useless
of
no
use
at
acting
on
norah
s
wishes
a
priest
was
called
in
heard
norah
s
confession
and
administered
the
sacraments
this
made
the
girl
happy
for
many
days
ellen
disliked
priests
but
never
gave
hint
of
her
dislike
to
norah
ye
re
sic
a
funny
little
thing
she
exclaimed
more
than
once
i
took
a
fancy
to
ye
when
i
saw

for
the
first
time
that
mornin
on
greenock

sun
shone
almost
daily
through

window
and
rested
on

bed
the
birds
twittered
on
the
roof
their
songs
even
in

filling

very
near
the
two
occupants
of
the
room
they
were
three
weeks
behind
with
the
rent
the
landlord
threatened
to
evict
them
the
grocer
grumbled
the
coal
man

not

added
to
this
ellen
had
lost
her
job
as
charwoman
in

dear
old
pious

made
enquiries
into

had
lost
most
of
its
delicacy
of

she
could
feel

faintly
almost
like
the
wing
of
a
butterfly
flickering
against
the
net
in
which
it
is
imprisoned

joy
in
a
little
while
norah
recovered
and
looked
round
with
large
puzzled
eyes
then
as
if
recollecting
something
is
he
comin
she
asked
eagerly
but
so
softly
that
ellen
had
to
bend
down
to
catch
the
words

and
grasped
that
of
her
friend

she
said
ye

more
n
a
mother
to

not

something
tells
me
that
i
m
for
another
place
i
m
not
afeared
to
die
ellen
why
should
i
but
sorrow
is
on
me
because
i
m
leavin
the
darkness
fell
the
two
women
were
silent
their
hands
clasped
tightly
and
their
eyes
full
of
tears
but
with
them
was
a
certain
strange
happiness
one
bright
thought
joined
another
bright
thought
in
their
minds
just
as
the
beams
of
a
fire
join
together
in
a
darkened
room
norah
fell
asleep
the
lamp
which
had
become
leaky
had
now
gone
out
ellen
lit
a
candle
stuck
it
into
the
neck
of
a
bottle
and
placed
the
bottle
on
the
floor
the
place
looked
desolate
and
forbidding
dead
ashes
lay
in
the
fireplace
a
pile
of
rags
ellen
s
bed
lay
in
the
corner
there
was
no
picture
in
the
place
nothing
to
lessen
the
monotony
save
the
little
crucifix
on
the
mantelpiece
and
this
relieving
feature
was
a
symbol
of
sorrow
ellen
glanced
at
the
sleeper
how
strangely
beautiful
she
looked
now
it
seemed
as
if
something
spiritual
and
divine
had
entered
the
body
of
norah
causing
her
to
look
more
like
the
creation
of
some
delightful
dream
than
an
erring
human
being
bowed
with
a
weight
of
sorrow
i
ll
go
out
and
get
some
coals
said
ellen
speaking
under
her
breath
then
we
ll
have
a
cheerful
fire
for
dermod
flynn
when
he
comes
he
was
sic
a
comely
lad
when

chapter
xxxv
the
farewell
meeting
i
for
the
rest
of
that
evening
between
short
periods
of
sleep
one
bright
vision
merged
with
another
in
front
of
norah
s
eyes
and
in
every
vision
the
face
of
dermod
flynn
stood
out
distinctly
clear
she
spoke
to
him
talked
of
home
of
the
people
whom
both
had
known
of
the
master
of
glenmornan
schoolhouse
of
maire
a
glan
of
micky
s
jim
and
the
squad
willie
the
duck
and
all
those
whom
they
had
known
so
well
a
few
short
years
before
but
for
all
she
spoke
dermod
never
answered
he
looked
at
her
in
silence
where
she
lay
the
life
passing
from
her
as
a
spent
fountain
weakens
as
an
echo
dies
away
the
candle
threw
out
a
fitful
flame
in
the
room
shadows
rushed
together
on
the
ceiling
forming
and
breaking
free
dancing
and
capering
in
strange
antics
steps
could
be
heard
on
the
stairs
the
tap
was
running
outside
and
the
water
fell
with
a
hissing
sound
ellen
was
still
out
the
room
was
deserted
nothing
there
but
the
shadows
on
the
ceiling
and
the
sick
girl
on
the
bed
by
the
window
she
was
asleep
when
dermod
flynn
came
and
wakened
to
find
him
standing
by
her
bed
looking
down
at
her
with
eyes
full
of
love
and
pity
there
was
no
surprise
written
on
her
face
when
she
saw
him
to
norah
for
days
he
had
been
as
near
in
dreams
as
he
was
now
in
real
flesh
and
blood
i
was
dreamin
of
ye
dermod
she
said
in
a
low
voice
sitting
up
with
one
elbow
buried
in
the
pillow
and
her
bare
shoulders
showing
white
and
delicate
under
her
locks
of
brown
hair
ye
took
the
good
time
in
comin
she
went
on
but
there
was
longing
not
protest
in
her
voice
ellen

me
that

down
on
his
knees
by
the
bedside

said
i

been
looking
for
you
for
such
a
long
have
ye
she
asked
her
voice
tinged
with
a
thousand
regrets
rising
a
little
as
if
in
mute
protest
against
the
shadows
dancing
on
the
roof
sobbing
like
a
child
she
sank
back
in
the
bed
it
s
the
kindly
way
that
ye
have
with
ye
dermod
she
said
in
a
quieter
voice
ye

been
leadin
for
a
good
lot

it

meself
that

exclaimed
withdrawing
her
hands
from
dermod

grasp
as

had
been
stung
what

be
doin
wantin
to

i
remember
it
he
looked
at
her
closely
puzzled
no
doubt
by
her
utterances
she
was
now
rambling
a
little
again
dreams
intermingled
with
reality
and
her
fingers
were
making
folds
in
the
sheets
dermod
remembered
how
in
glenmornan
this
was
considered
a
sign
of
death
she
began
to
talk
to
herself
her
head
on
the
pillow
one
erring
tress
of
hair
lying
across
her
cheek
it
was
the
child
dermod
she
said
a
smile
playing
over
her
features
it
was
the
little
boy
and
he
was
dyin
both
of
a
cough
that
was
stickin
in
his
throat
and
of
starvation
as
for

three
men
on

they
made
fun
of
me
when

she
went
on
then
they

a
rush
at

the
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
with
clumsy
but
tender
fingers
he
brushed
back
the
hair
from
her
brow
and
listened
to
her
talk
as
one
listens
to
the
sound
of
a
lonely
breeze
the
mind
deep
in
unfathomable
reflections
gourock
ellen
entered
the
room
and
cast
a
curious
look
round
seeing
dermod
kneeling
at
the
bedside
the
woman
felt
herself
an
intruder
she
came
forward
however
and
bent
over
the
girl

shoulder
touching
the
head
of
the
young
man
norah

eyes
were
closed
and
a
pallor
overspread
