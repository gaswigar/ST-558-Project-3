she
answered
through
her
teeth
and

heartily

chapter

the

said
the
woman
speaking
very
quietly
to
herself
not
another
day
nor
a
night
if
i
can
be
ready
before
morning
she
stood
alone
in
her
own
room
with
none
to
mark
the
pallor
of
the
oval
face
the
scornful
curve
of
quivering
nostrils
the
dry
lustre
of
flashing
eyes
but
while
she
stood
a
heavy
step
went
blustering
down
two
flights
of
stairs
and
double
doors
slammed
upon
the
ground
floor
it
was
a
little
london
house
with
five
floors
from
basement
to
attic
and
a
couple
of
rooms
upon
each
like
most
little
houses
in
london
but
this
one
had
latterly
been
the
scene
of
an
equally
undistinguished
drama
of
real
life
upon
which
the
curtain
was
even
now
descending
although
a
third
was
whispered
by
the
world
the
persons
of
this
drama
were
really
only
two
rachel
minchin
before
the
disastrous
step
which
gave
her
that
surname
was
a
young
australian
lady
whose
apparent
attractions
were
only
equalled
by
her
absolute
poverty
that
is
to
say
she
had
been
born
at
heidelberg
near
melbourne
of
english
parents
more
gentle
than
practical
who
soon
left
her
to
fight
the
world
and
the
devil
with
no
other
armory
than
a
good
face
a
fine
nature
and
the
pride
of
any
heiress
it
is
true
that
rachel
also
had
a
voice
but
there
was
never
enough
of
it
to
augur
an
income
at
twenty
therefore
she
was
already
a
governess
in
the
wilds
where
women
are
as
scarce
as
water
but
where
the
man
for
rachel
did
not
breathe
a
few
years
later
she
earned
a
berth
to
england
as
companion
to
a
lady
and
her
fate
awaited
her
on
board
minchin
had
reached
his
prime
in
the
underworld
of
which
he
also
was
a
native
without
touching
affluence
until
his
fortieth
year
nevertheless
he
was
a
travelled
man
and
no
mere
nomad
of
the
bush
as
a
mining
expert
he
had
seen
much
life
in
south
africa
as
well
as
in
western
australia
but
at
last
he
was
to
see
more
in
europe
as
a
gentleman
of
means
a
wife
had
no
place
in
his
european
scheme
a
husband
was
the
last
thing
rachel
wanted
but
a
long
sea
voyage
an
uncongenial
employ
and
the
persistent
chivalry
of
a
handsome
entertaining
man
of
the
world
formed
a
combination
as
fatal
to
her
inexperience
as
that
of
so
much
poverty
pride
and
beauty
proved
to
alexander
minchin
they
were
married
without
ceremony
on
the
very
day
that
they
arrived
in
england
where
they
had
not
an
actual
friend
between
them
nor
a
relative
to
whom
either
was
personally
known
in
the
beginning
this
mattered
nothing
they
had
to
see
europe
and
enjoy
themselves
that
they
could
do
unaided
and
the
bride
did
it
only
the
more
thoroughly
in
a
sort
of
desperation
as
she
realized
that
the
benefits
of
her
marriage
were
to
be
wholly
material
after
all
in
the
larger
life
of
cities
alexander
minchin
was
no
longer
the
idle
and
cavalier
to
whom
rachel
had
learned
to
look
for
unfailing
consideration
at
sea
the
illustrative
incidents
may
be
omitted
but
here
he
gambled
there
he
drank
and
in
his
cups
every
virtue
dissolved
rachel
pride
did
not
mend
matters
she
was
a
thought
too
ready
with
her
resentment
of
this
however
she
was
herself
aware
and
would
forgive
the
more
freely
because
there
was
often
some
obvious
fault
on
her
side
before
all
was
said
quarrels
of
infinite
bitterness
were
thus
patched
up
and
the
end
indefinitely
delayed
in
the
meantime
tired
of
travelling
and
impoverished
by
the
follies
the
hapless
couple
returned
to
london
where
a
pure
fluke
with
some
mining
shares
introduced
minchin
to
finer
gambling
than
he
had
found
abroad
the
man
was
bitten
there
was
a
fortune
waiting
for
special
knowledge
and
a
little
ready
cash
and
alexander
minchin
settled
down
to
make
it
taking
for
the
nonce
a
furnished
house
in
a
modest
neighborhood
and
here
it
was
that
the
quarrelling
continued
to
its
culmination
in
the
scene
just
ended
not
another
day
said
rachel
nor
a
night
if
i
can
be
ready
before
morning
being
still
a
woman
with
some
strength
of
purpose
minchin
did
not
stop
at
idle
words
the
interval
between
the
slamming
of
doors
below
and
another
noise
at
the
top
of
the
house
was
not
one
of
many
minutes
the
other
noise
was
made
by
rachel
and
her
empty
trunk
upon
the
loftiest
and
the
narrowest
flight
of
stairs
one
of
the
maids
opened
their
door
an
inch
i
am
sorry
if
i
disturbed
you
their
mistress
said
these
stairs
are
so
very
narrow
no
thank
you
i
can
manage
quite
well
and
they
heard
her
about
until
they
slept
it
was
no
light
task
to
which
rachel
had
set
her
hand
she
was
going
back
to
australia
by
the
first
boat
and
her
packing
must
be
done
that
night
her
resolve
only
hardened
as
her
spirit
cooled
the
sooner
her
departure
the
less
his
opposition
let
her
delay
and
the
callousness
of
the
passing
brute
might
give
place
to
the
tyranny
of
the
normal
man
but
she
was
going
whether
or
no
not
another
day
though
she
would
doubtless
see
its
dawn
it
was
the
month
of
september
and
she
was
not
going
to
fly
nor
fly
at
all
she
was
going
deliberately
away
with
a
trunk
containing
all
that
she
should
want
upon
the
voyage
the
selection
was
not
too
easily
made
in
his
better
moods
the
creature
had
been
lavish
enough
and
more
than
once
did
rachel
snatch
from
drawer
or
wardrobe
that
which
remained
some
moments
in
her
hand
while
the
incidents
of
purchase
and
the
first
joys
of
possession
to
one
who
had
possessed
so
little
in
her
life
came
back
to
her
with
a
certain
poignancy
but
her
resolve
remained
unshaken
it
might
hurt
her
to
take
his
personal
gifts
but
that
was
all
she
had
ever
had
from
him
he
had
never
granted
her
a
set
allowance
for
every
penny
she
must
needs
ask
and
look
grateful
it
would
be
no
fault
of
hers
if
she
had
to
strip
her
fingers
for
yet
the
exigency
troubled
her
it
touched
her
honor
to
say
nothing
of
her
pride
and
after
an
unforeseen
fit
of
irresolution
rachel
suddenly
determined
to
tell
her
husband
of
her
difficulty
making
direct
appeal
to
the
capricious
generosity
which
had
been
recalled
to
her
mind
as
an
undeniably
redeeming
point
it
was
true
that
he
had
given
her
hearty
leave
to
go
to
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
and
highly
probable
that
he
would
bid
her
work
her
own
way
she
felt
an
impulse
to
put
it
to
him
however
and
at
once
she
looked
at
her
watch
it
at
least
had
been
her
mother
and
the
final
day
was
already
an
hour
old
but
alexander
minchin
was
a
late
sitter
as
his
young
wife
knew
to
her
cost
and
he
had
told
her
where
he
meant
to
sleep
but
she
had
not
heard
him
come
up
the
room
would
have
been
the
back
in
the
majority
of
such
houses
and
rachel
peeped
in
on
her
way
down
it
was
empty
moreover
the
bed
was
not
made
nor
the
curtains
drawn
rachel
repaired
the
first
omission
then
hesitated
finally
creeping
upstairs
again
for
clean
sheets
and
as
she
made
his
bed
not
out
of
any
lingering
love
for
him
but
from
a
sense
of
duty
and
some
consideration
for
his
comfort
there
was
yet
something
touching
in
her
instinctive
care
that
breathed
the
wife
she
could
have
been
he
did
not
hear
her
though
the
stairs
creaked
the
smallness
of
the
hour
or
if
he
heard
he
made
no
sign
this
discouraged
rachel
as
she
stole
down
the
lower
flight
she
would
have
preferred
the
angriest
sign
but
there
were
few
internal
sounds
which
penetrated
to
the
little
study
at
the
back
of
the
for
the
permanent
tenant
was
the
widow
of
an
eminent
professor
lately
deceased
and
that
student
had
protected
his
quiet
with
double
doors
the
outer
one
in
dark
red
baize
made
an
alarming
noise
as
rachel
pulled
it
open
but
though
she
waited
no
sound
came
from
within
nor
was
minchin
disturbed
by
the
final
entry
of
his
wife
whose
first
glance
convinced
her
of
the
cause
in
the
professor
armchair
sat
his
unworthy
successor
chin
on
waistcoat
a
newspaper
across
his
knees
an
empty
decanter
at
one
elbow
something
remained
in
the
glass
beside
the
bottle
he
had
tumbled
off
before
the
end
there
were
even
signs
of
deliberate
preparations
for
slumber
for
the
shade
was
tilted
over
the
electric
light
by
which
he
had
been
reading
as
a
hat
is
tilted
over
the
eyes
rachel
had
a
touch
of
pity
at
seeing
him
in
a
chair
for
the
night
but
the
testimony
of
the
decanter
forbade
remorse
she
had
filled
it
herself
in
the
evening
against
her
husband
return
from
an
absence
of
mysterious
length
now
she
understood
that
mystery
and
her
face
darkened
as
she
recalled
the
inconceivable
insult
which
his
explanation
had
embraced
no
indeed
not
another
minute
that
she
could
help
and
he
would
sleep
there
till
all
hours
of
the
morning
he
had
done
it
before
the
longer
the
better
this
time
she
had
recoiled
into
the
narrow
hall
driven
by
an
uncontrollable
revulsion
and
there
she
stood
pale
and
quivering
with
a
disgust
that
only
deepened
as
she
looked
her
last
upon
the
shaded
face
and
the
inanimate
frame
in
the
chair
rachel
could
not
account
for
the
intensity
of
her
feeling
it
bordered
upon
nausea
and
for
a
time
prevented
her
from
retracing
the
single
step
which
at
length
enabled
her
to
shut
both
doors
as
quietly
as
she
had
opened
them
after
switching
off
the
light
from
force
of
habit
there
was
another
light
still
glowing
in
the
hall
and
again
from
habit
rachel
put
it
out
also
before
setting
foot
upon
the
stairs
a
moment
later
she
was
standing
in
the
dark
it
was
no
sound
from
the
study
but
the
tiniest
of
metallic
rattles
from
the
flap
of
the
in
the
front
door
the
wind
might
have
done
it
for
the
flap
had
lost
its
spring
and
though
the
noise
was
not
repeated
to
the
wind
rachel
put
it
down
as
she
mounted
the
stairs
at
last
in
a
flutter
that
caused
her
both
shame
and
apprehension
her
nerve
was
going
and
she
needed
it
so
it
should
not
go
it
should
not
and
as
if
to
steady
it
she
opened
the
landing
window
and
spent
some
minutes
gazing
out
into
the
cool
and
starry
night
not
that
she
could
see
very
far
the
backs
of
houses
hid
half
the
stars
in
front
and
on
either
hand
making
with
the
back
of
this
house
and
its
fellows
a
kind
of
square
turned
inside
out
miserable
little
gardens
glimmered
through
an
irregular
network
of
grimy
walls
with
here
and
there
a
fair
tree
in
autumnal
tatters
but
rachel
looked
neither
at
these
nor
at
the
stars
that
lit
them
dimly
in
a
single
window
of
those
right
opposite
a
single
lamp
had
burnt
all
night
it
was
the
only
earthly
light
that
rachel
could
see
the
only
one
of
earth
or
heaven
upon
which
she
looked
and
she
discovered
it
with
thanksgiving
and
tore
her
eyes
away
from
it
with
a
prayer
in
time
the
trunk
was
packed
and
incontinently
carried
downstairs
by
an
effort
which
left
rachel
racked
in
every
muscle
and
swaying
giddily
but
she
could
not
have
made
much
noise
for
still
there
was
no
sign
from
the
study
she
scarcely
paused
to
breathe
a
latchkey
closed
the
door
behind
her
very
softly
she
was
in
the
crisp
clean
air
at
last
but
it
was
no
hour
for
finding
cabs
it
was
the
hour
of
the
scavenger
and
no
other
being
and
rachel
walked
into
broad
sunlight
before
she
spied
a
solitary
hansom
it
was
then
she
did
the
strangest
thing
instead
of
driving
straight
back
for
her
trunk
when
near
the
house
she
gave
the
cabman
other
directions
subsequently
stopping
him
at
one
with
a
card
in
the
window
a
woman
answered
the
bell
with
surprising
celerity
and
a
face
first
startled
and
then
incensed
at
the
sight
of
minchin
so
you
never
came
cried
the
woman
bitterly
i
was
prevented
rachel
replied
coldly
well
and
the
monosyllable
was
a
whisper
he
is
still
alive
said
the
woman
at
the
door
is
that
all
asked
rachel
a
catch
in
her
voice
it
is
all
i
say
till
the
doctor
has
been
but
he
has
got
through
the
night
sighed
rachel
thankfully
i
could
see
the
light
in
his
room
from
hour
to
hour
even
though
i
could
not
come
did
you
sit
up
with
him
all
night
long
every
minute
of
the
night
said
the
other
with
undisguised
severity
in
her
fixed
red
eyes
i
never
left
him
and
i
never
closed
a
lid
i
am
so
sorry
cried
rachel
too
sorry
even
for
renewed
indignation
at
the
cause
but
i
could
help
it
she
continued
i
really
could
not
we
i
am
going
abroad
very
suddenly
poor
severino
i
do
wish
there
was
anything
i
could
do
but
you
must
get
a
professional
nurse
and
when
he
does
recover
for
something
assures
me
that
he
will
you
can
tell
him
rachel
hesitated
the
red
eyes
reading
hers
tell
him
i
hope
he
will
recover
altogether
she
said
at
length
mind
altogether
i
have
gone
away
for
good
tell
severino
but
as
i
was
able
to
do
so
after
all
i
would
rather
you
did
mention
that
i
ever
thought
of
nursing
him
or
that
i
called
last
thing
to
ask
how
he
was
and
that
was
her
farewell
message
to
the
very
young
man
with
whom
a
scandal
had
coupled
rachel
minchin
name
it
was
to
be
a
final
utterance
in
yet
another
respect
and
one
of
no
slight
or
private
significance
as
the
sequel
will
show
within
a
minute
or
two
of
its
delivery
rachel
was
on
her
own
doorstep
for
the
last
time
deftly
and
gently
turning
the
latchkey
while
the
birds
sang
to
frenzy
in
a
neighboring
garden
and
the
early
sun
glanced
fierily
from
the
brass
knocker
and
another
moment
and
the
door
had
been
flung
wide
open
by
a
police
officer
who
seemed
to
fill
the
narrow
hall
with
a
comrade
behind
him
and
both
servants
on
the
stairs
and
with
little
further
warning
minchin
was
shown
her
husband
seated
much
as
she
had
left
him
in
the
professor
chair
but
with
his
feet
raised
stiffly
upon
another
and
the
hand
of
death
over
every
inch
of
him
in
the
broad
north
light
that
filled
the
room
the
young
widow
stood
gazing
upon
her
dead
and
four
pairs
of
eyes
gazed
yet
more
closely
at
her
but
there
was
little
to
gather
from
the
strained
profile
with
the
white
cheek
and
the
unyielding
lips
not
a
cry
had
left
them
she
had
but
crossed
the
threshold
and
stopped
that
instant
in
the
middle
of
the
worn
carpet
the
sharpest
of
silhouettes
against
a
background
of
grim
tomes
there
was
no
swaying
of
the
lissome
figure
no
snatching
for
support
no
question
spoken
or
unspoken
in
moments
of
acute
surprise
the
most
surprising
feature
is
often
the
way
in
which
we
ourselves
receive
the
shock
a
sudden
and
complete
detachment
not
the
least
common
of
immediate
results
makes
us
sometimes
even
conscious
of
our
failure
to
feel
as
we
would
or
should
and
it
was
so
with
rachel
minchin
in
the
first
moments
of
her
tragic
freedom
so
god
had
sundered
whom
god
had
joined
together
and
this
was
the
man
whom
she
had
married
for
love
and
she
could
look
upon
his
clay
unmoved
her
mind
leapt
to
a
minor
consideration
that
still
made
her
shudder
as
eight
eyes
noted
from
the
door
he
must
have
been
dead
when
she
came
down
and
found
him
seated
in
shadow
she
had
misjudged
the
dead
if
not
the
living
the
pose
of
the
head
was
unaltered
the
chin
upon
the
chest
the
mouth
closed
in
death
as
naturally
as
in
sleep
no
wonder
his
wife
had
been
deceived
and
yet
there
was
something
unfamiliar
something
negligent
and
noble
and
all
unlike
the
living
man
so
that
rachel
could
already
marvel
that
she
had
not
at
once
detected
this
dignity
and
this
distinction
only
too
foreign
to
her
husband
as
she
had
learnt
to
know
him
best
but
unattainable
in
the
noblest
save
by
death
and
her
eyes
had
risen
to
the
slice
of
sky
in
the
upper
half
of
the
window
and
at
last
the
tears
were
rising
in
her
eyes
when
they
filled
instead
with
sudden
horror
and
enlightenment
there
was
a
jagged
hole
in
the
pane
above
the
hasp
an
upset
of
ink
on
the
desk
beneath
the
window
and
the
ink
was
drying
with
the
dead
blood
in
which
she
now
perceived
him
to
be
soaked
while
the
newspaper
on
the
floor
beside
him
was
crisp
as
toast
from
that
which
it
had
hidden
when
she
saw
him
last
murdered
whispered
rachel
breaking
her
long
silence
with
a
gasp
the
work
of
thieves
the
policemen
exchanged
a
rapid
glance
looks
like
it
said
the
one
who
had
opened
the
door
i
admit
there
was
a
superfluous
dryness
in
his
tone
but
rachel
no
more
noticed
this
than
the
further
craning
of
heads
in
the
doorway
but
can
you
doubt
it
she
cried
pointing
from
the
broken
window
to
the
spilled
ink
did
you
think
that
he
had
shot
himself
and
her
horror
heightened
at
a
thought
more
terrible
to
her
than
all
the
rest
but
the
constable
shook
his
head
we
should
have
found
the
pistol
which
we
ca
said
he
but
shot
he
is
and
through
the
heart
then
who
could
it
be
but
thieves
that
what
we
all
want
to
know
said
the
officer
and
still
rachel
had
no
time
to
think
about
his
tone
for
now
she
was
bending
over
the
body
her
white
hands
clenched
and
agony
enough
in
her
white
face
look
look
she
cried
beckoning
to
them
all
he
was
wearing
his
watch
last
night
that
i
can
swear
and
it
has
gone
you
are
sure
he
was
wearing
it
asked
the
same
constable
approaching
absolutely
certain
well
if
that
so
said
he
and
it
ca
be
found
it
will
be
a
point
in
your
favor
rachel
sprang
upright
her
wet
eyes
wide
with
pure
astonishment
in
my
favor
she
cried
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
explain
yourself
the
constables
were
standing
on
either
side
of
her
now
well
replied
the
spokesman
of
the
pair
i
do
like
the
way
that
window
broken
for
one
thing
and
if
you
look
at
it
you
see
what
i
mean
the
broken
glass
is
all
outside
on
the
sill
but
that
not
all
and
as
you
have
a
cab
we
might
do
worse
than
drive
to
the
station
before
more
people
are
about
chapter
ii
the
case
for
the
crown
it
was
years
since
there
had
been
a
promise
of
such
sensation
at
the
old
bailey
and
never
perhaps
was
competition
keener
for
the
very
few
seats
available
in
that
antique
theatre
of
justice
nor
indeed
could
the
most
enterprising
of
modern
managers
with
the
star
of
all
the
stages
at
his
beck
for
the
shortest
of
seasons
have
done
more
to
spread
the
lady
fame
or
to
excite
a
passionate
curiosity
in
the
public
mind
than
was
done
for
rachel
minchin
by
her
official
enemies
of
the
metropolitan
police
whether
these
gentry
had
their
case
even
more
complete
than
they
pretended
when
the
prisoner
was
finally
committed
for
trial
or
whether
the
last
discoveries
were
really
made
in
the
ensuing
fortnight
is
now
of
small
account
though
the
point
provided
more
than
one
excuse
for
acrimony
on
the
part
of
defending
counsel
during
the
hearing
of
the
case
it
is
certain
however
that
shortly
after
the
committal
it
became
known
that
much
new
evidence
was
to
be
forthcoming
at
the
trial
that
the
case
against
the
prisoner
would
be
found
even
blacker
than
before
and
that
the
witnesses
were
so
many
in
number
and
their
testimony
so
entirely
circumstantial
that
the
proceedings
were
expected
to
occupy
a
week
sure
enough
the
case
was
accorded
first
place
in
the
november
sessions
with
a
fair
start
on
a
monday
morning
toward
the
latter
end
of
the
month
in
the
purlieus
of
the
mean
historic
court
it
was
a
morning
not
to
be
forgotten
and
only
to
be
compared
with
those
which
followed
throughout
the
week
the
prisoner
sex
her
youth
her
high
bearing
and
the
peculiar
isolation
of
her
position
without
a
friend
to
stand
by
her
in
her
need
all
appealed
to
the
popular
imagination
and
produced
a
fascination
which
was
only
intensified
by
the
equally
general
feeling
that
no
one
else
could
have
committed
the
crime
from
the
judge
downward
all
connected
with
the
case
were
pestered
for
days
beforehand
with
more
or
less
unwarrantable
applications
for
admission
and
when
the
time
came
the
successful
suppliant
had
to
elbow
every
yard
of
his
way
from
newgate
street
or
ludgate
hill
to
pass
three
separate
barriers
held
by
a
suspicious
constabulary
to
obtain
the
good
offices
of
the
under
sheriff
through
those
of
his
liveried
lackeys
and
finally
to
occupy
the
least
space
on
the
narrowest
of
seats
in
a
varnished
stall
filled
with
curiously
familiar
faces
within
a
few
feet
of
the
heavily
veiled
prisoner
in
the
dock
and
not
many
more
from
the
judge
upon
the
bench
the
first
to
take
all
this
trouble
on
the
monday
morning
and
the
last
to
escape
from
the
foul
air
shot
by
biting
draughts
when
the
court
adjourned
was
a
gentleman
of
striking
appearance
and
stamina
to
match
for
undeterred
by
the
experience
he
was
in
like
manner
first
and
last
upon
each
subsequent
day
behind
him
came
and
went
the
faces
the
authors
and
the
actors
with
a
interest
in
the
case
but
they
were
not
well
known
to
the
gentleman
with
the
white
head
he
heard
no
more
than
he
could
help
of
their
constant
whisperings
and
if
he
knew
not
at
whom
he
more
than
once
had
occasion
to
turn
and
frown
he
certainly
did
not
look
the
man
to
care
he
had
a
reddish
face
with
a
small
mouth
of
extraordinary
strength
a
canine
jaw
and
singularly
noble
forehead
but
his
most
obvious
distinction
was
his
full
head
of
snowy
hair
the
only
hair
upon
his
face
a
pair
of
bushy
eyebrows
was
so
much
darker
as
to
suggest
a
dye
but
the
eyes
themselves
were
black
as
midnight
with
a
glint
of
midnight
stars
and
of
such
a
subtle
inscrutability
that
a
certain
sweetness
of
expression
came
only
as
the
last
surprise
in
a
face
full
of
contrast
and
contradiction
no
one
in
court
had
ever
seen
this
man
before
no
one
but
the
under
sheriff
learnt
his
name
during
the
week
but
by
the
third
day
his
identity
was
a
subject
of
discussion
both
by
the
professional
students
of
the
human
countenance
who
sat
behind
him
balked
of
their
study
by
the
prisoner
veil
and
among
the
various
functionaries
who
had
already
found
him
as
free
with
a
sovereign
as
most
gentlemen
are
with
a
piece
of
silver
so
every
day
he
was
ushered
with
ceremony
to
the
same
place
at
the
inner
end
of
the
lowest
row
there
he
would
sit
watching
the
prisoner
a
trifle
nearer
her
than
those
beside
or
behind
him
and
only
once
was
his
attentive
serenity
broken
for
an
instant
by
a
change
of
expression
due
to
any
development
of
the
case
it
was
not
when
the
prisoner
pleaded
clearly
through
her
veil
in
the
first
breathless
minutes
of
all
it
was
not
a
little
later
when
the
urbane
counsel
for
the
prosecution
wagging
his
at
the
jury
thrilled
every
other
hearer
with
a
mellifluous
forecast
of
the
new
evidence
to
be
laid
before
them
the
missing
watch
and
chain
had
been
found
they
would
presently
be
produced
and
the
jury
would
have
an
opportunity
of
examining
them
together
with
a
plan
of
the
chimney
of
the
room
in
which
the
murder
had
been
committed
for
it
was
there
that
they
had
been
discovered
upon
a
second
search
instituted
since
the
proceedings
before
the
magistrates
the
effect
of
this
announcement
may
be
conceived
it
was
the
sensation
of
the
opening
day
the
whole
case
of
the
prosecution
rested
on
the
assumption
that
there
had
been
on
the
part
of
some
inmate
of
the
house
who
alone
it
was
held
could
have
committed
the
murder
a
deliberate
attempt
to
give
it
the
appearance
of
the
work
of
thieves
thus
far
this
theory
rested
on
the
bare
facts
that
the
glass
of
the
broken
window
had
been
found
outside
instead
of
within
that
no
other
mark
of
foot
or
hand
had
been
made
or
left
by
the
supposititious
burglars
whereas
a
brace
of
revolvers
had
been
discovered
in
the
dead
man
bureau
both
loaded
with
such
bullets
as
the
one
which
had
caused
his
death
while
one
of
them
had
clearly
been
discharged
since
the
last
cleaning
the
discovery
of
the
missing
watch
and
chain
in
the
very
chimney
of
the
same
room
was
a
piece
of
ideal
evidence
of
the
confirmatory
kind
but
it
was
not
the
point
that
made
an
impression
on
the
man
with
the
white
hair
it
did
not
increase
his
attention
for
that
would
have
been
impossible
he
was
perhaps
the
one
spectator
who
was
not
if
only
for
the
moment
perceptibly
thrilled
thrilling
also
was
the
earlier
evidence
furnished
by
and
police
constables
in
pairs
but
here
there
was
no
surprise
the
maids
were
examined
not
only
as
to
what
they
had
seen
and
heard
on
the
night
of
the
murder
and
they
seemed
to
have
heard
everything
except
the
fatal
shot
but
upon
the
previous
relations
of
their
master
and
mistress
of
which
they
showed
an
equally
extensive
knowledge
the
constables
were
perforce
confined
to
their
own
discoveries
and
observations
when
the
maids
had
called
them
in
but
all
four
witnesses
spoke
to
the
behavior
when
shown
the
dead
body
of
her
husband
and
there
was
the
utmost
unanimity
in
their
several
tales
the
prisoner
had
exhibited
little
or
no
surprise
it
was
several
minutes
before
she
had
uttered
a
syllable
and
then
her
first
words
had
been
to
point
out
that
burglars
alone
could
have
committed
the
murder
in
the
senior
counsel
for
the
defence
thus
early
showed
his
hand
and
it
was
not
a
strong
one
to
those
who
knew
the
game
a
queen
counsel
like
the
leader
for
the
crown
this
was
an
altogether
different
type
of
lawyer
a
younger
man
with
a
more
engaging
manner
a
more
brilliant
man
who
sought
with
doubtful
wisdom
to
blind
the
jury
with
his
brilliance
his
method
was
no
innovation
at
the
old
bailey
it
was
to
hold
up
every
witness
in
turn
to
the
derision
and
contempt
of
the
jury
and
the
court
so
both
the
maids
were
reduced
to
tears
and
each
policeman
cleverly
insulted
as
such
but
the
testimony
of
all
four
remained
unshaken
and
the
judge
himself
soothed
the
young
women
feelings
with
a
fatherly
word
while
wigs
were
shaken
in
the
well
of
the
court
that
was
no
road
to
the
soft
side
of
a
decent
conscientious
jury
of
much
the
same
class
as
these
witnesses
themselves
even
the
actors
and
authors
had
a
sound
opinion
on
the
point
without
waiting
to
hear
one
from
the
professional
gentlemen
in
the
well
but
the
man
in
front
with
the
very
white
hair
the
man
who
was
always
watching
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
there
was
about
as
much
expression
of
opinion
upon
his
firm
bare
face
as
might
be
seen
through
the
sable
thickness
of
her
widow
veil
it
was
the
same
next
day
when
for
some
five
hours
out
of
a
possible
five
and
a
half
the
attention
of
the
court
was
concentrated
upon
a
point
of
obviously
secondary
significance
it
was
suggested
by
the
defence
that
the
watch
and
chain
found
up
the
study
chimney
were
not
those
worn
by
the
deceased
at
the
time
he
met
his
death
the
contention
was
supported
by
photographs
of
alexander
minchin
wearing
a
that
might
or
might
not
be
of
another
pattern
altogether
expert
opinions
were
divided
on
the
point
and
experts
in
chains
as
well
as
in
photography
were
eventually
called
by
both
sides
interesting
in
the
beginning
the
point
was
raised
and
raised
again
and
on
subsequent
days
until
all
were
weary
of
the
sight
of
the
huge
photographic
enlargements
which
were
handed
about
the
court
upon
each
occasion
even
the
prisoner
would
droop
in
her
chair
when
the
chain
photograph
was
demanded
for
the
twentieth
time
by
her
own
unflagging
counsel
even
the
judge
became
all
but
inattentive
on
the
point
before
it
was
finally
dropped
on
an
intimation
from
the
jury
that
they
had
made
up
their
minds
about
the
chains
but
no
trace
of
boredom
had
crossed
the
keen
alert
face
of
the
unknown
gentleman
with
the
snowy
hair
so
the
case
was
fought
for
minchin
tooth
and
nail
indeed
yet
perhaps
with
more
asperity
than
conviction
and
certainly
at
times
upon
points
which
were
hardly
worth
the
fighting
yet
on
the
friday
afternoon
when
her
counsel
at
last
played
his
masterstroke
and
taking
advantage
of
the
then
new
act
put
the
prisoner
herself
in
the
it
was
done
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
throwing
up
his
case
the
truth
could
be
seen
at
a
glance
at
the
handsome
but
too
expressive
profile
of
the
crushing
of
female
witnesses
and
insolent
foe
to
the
police
as
it
had
been
possible
to
predict
from
the
mere
look
with
which
he
had
risen
to
his
feet
the
kind
of
in
store
for
each
witness
called
by
the
prosecution
so
it
was
obvious
now
that
his
own
witness
had
come
forward
from
her
own
wilful
perversity
and
in
direct
defiance
of
his
advice
it
was
a
dismal
afternoon
and
the
at
the
old
bailey
is
so
situated
that
evidence
is
given
with
the
back
to
the
light
thus
though
her
heavy
veil
was
raised
at
last
and
it
could
be
seen
that
she
was
very
pale
it
was
not
yet
that
rachel
minchin
afforded
a
chance
to
the
lightning
artists
of
the
press
or
even
to
the
students
of
physiognomy
behind
the
man
with
the
white
hair
this
listener
did
not
lean
forward
an
inch
the
questions
were
answered
in
so
clear
a
voice
as
to
render
it
unnecessary
yet
it
was
one
of
these
questions
put
by
her
own
counsel
which
caused
the
man
to
clap
a
sudden
hand
to
his
ear
and
to
incline
that
ear
as
though
the
answer
could
not
come
without
some
momentary
hesitation
or
some
change
of
tone
rachel
had
told
sadly
but
firmly
of
her
final
quarrel
with
her
husband
incidentally
but
without
embarrassment
revealing
its
cause
a
neighbor
was
dangerously
ill
whom
she
had
been
going
to
nurse
that
night
when
her
husband
met
her
at
the
door
and
forbade
her
to
do
so
was
this
neighbor
a
young
man
hardly
more
than
a
boy
said
rachel
and
as
friendless
as
ourselves
was
your
husband
jealous
of
him
i
had
no
idea
of
it
until
that
night
did
you
find
it
out
then
i
did
indeed
and
where
had
your
husband
been
spending
the
evening
i
had
no
idea
of
that
either
until
he
told
me
he
had
been
watching
the
house
and
why
though
the
man
was
dead
she
could
not
rid
her
voice
of
its
scorn
and
presently
with
bowed
head
she
was
repeating
his
last
words
to
her
a
cold
thrill
ran
through
the
court
and
was
that
the
last
time
you
saw
him
alive
inquired
counsel
his
face
lightening
in
ready
apprehension
of
the
thrill
and
his
assurance
coming
back
to
him
on
the
spot
as
though
it
were
he
who
had
insisted
on
putting
his
client
in
the
box
but
to
this
there
was
no
immediate
answer
for
it
was
here
that
the
man
raised
his
hand
to
his
ear
and
the
event
was
exactly
as
he
seemed
to
have
anticipated
was
that
the
last
time
you
saw
your
husband
alive
repeated
counsel
in
the
winning
accents
and
with
the
reassuring
face
that
he
could
assume
without
an
effort
at
his
will
it
was
said
rachel
after
yet
another
moment
thought
it
was
then
that
the
man
dropped
his
eyes
for
once
and
for
once
the
thin
hard
lines
of
his
mouth
relaxed
in
a
smile
that
seemed
to
epitomize
all
the
evil
that
was
in
his
face
and
to
give
it
forth
in
one
sudden
sour
quintessence
chapter
iii
name
and
nature
the
prisoner
evidence
concluded
with
a
perfectly
simple
if
somewhat
hesitating
account
of
her
own
doings
during
the
remainder
of
the
night
of
her
husband
murder
that
story
has
already
been
told
in
greater
detail
than
could
be
extracted
even
by
the
urbane
but
deadly
who
led
for
the
crown
a
change
had
come
over
the
manner
in
which
rachel
was
giving
her
evidence
it
was
as
though
her
strength
and
nerve
were
failing
her
together
and
henceforth
the
words
had
to
be
put
into
her
mouth
curiously
enough
the
change
in
demeanor
was
almost
coincident
with
the
single
and
rather
sinister
display
of
feeling
upon
the
part
of
the
gentleman
who
had
followed
every
word
of
the
case
on
the
whole
however
her
story
bore
the
stamp
of
truth
and
a
but
none
the
less
persistent
left
it
scarcely
less
convincing
than
before
there
was
one
independent
witness
for
the
defence
in
addition
to
the
experts
in
photography
and
chains
the
landlady
of
the
house
at
which
rachel
called
in
the
early
morning
on
her
way
home
with
the
cab
was
about
five
minutes
in
the
but
in
those
five
minutes
she
supplied
the
defence
with
one
of
its
strongest
arguments
it
was
at
least
conceivable
that
a
woman
who
had
killed
her
husband
might
coolly
proceed
to
pack
her
trunk
and
thereafter
fetch
the
cab
which
was
to
remove
herself
and
her
effects
from
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
but
was
it
credible
that
a
woman
of
so
much
presence
of
mind
to
whom
every
minute
might
make
the
difference
between
life
and
death
would
having
found
her
cab
actually
drive
out
of
her
way
to
inquire
after
a
sick
friend
or
even
a
dying
lover
before
going
home
to
pick
up
her
luggage
and
to
ascertain
whether
her
crime
was
still
undetected
suppose
it
were
a
lover
and
inquire
one
must
would
one
not
still
leave
those
inquiries
to
the
last
and
having
made
them
last
or
first
and
knowing
the
grim
necessity
of
flight
would
one
woman
go
out
of
her
way
to
tell
another
that
she
had
to
go
abroad
very
suddenly
and
was
going
for
good
inconceivable
cried
the
prisoner
counsel
dealing
with
the
point
and
the
word
was
much
upon
his
lips
during
the
course
of
a
long
and
very
strenuous
speech
in
which
the
case
for
the
crown
was
flouted
from
beginning
to
end
without
perhaps
enough
of
concentration
on
its
more
obvious
weaknesses
or
of
respect
for
its
undoubted
strength
for
the
prisoner
proceedings
on
the
night
of
the
murder
however
supposing
she
had
committed
it
and
still
more
on
the
morning
after
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
a
better
epithet
the
only
drawback
was
that
this
one
had
seen
service
in
the
cause
of
almost
every
murderer
who
ever
went
to
the
gallows
as
counsel
for
the
prosecution
remarked
in
his
reply
with
deadly
deference
to
his
learned
friend
on
the
other
hand
he
went
on
wagging
his
eyeglasses
with
leisurely
deliberation
and
picking
his
words
with
a
care
that
enhanced
their
effect
after
the
unbridled
rhetoric
of
the
defence
on
the
other
hand
gentlemen
if
criminals
never
made
mistakes
inconceivable
or
not
as
we
may
choose
to
consider
them
if
they
never
made
those
mistakes
they
would
never
stand
in
that
dock
it
was
late
on
the
saturday
afternoon
when
the
judge
summed
up
but
a
pleasant
surprise
was
in
store
for
those
who
felt
that
his
lordship
must
speak
at
greater
length
than
either
of
the
counsel
between
whom
he
was
to
hold
the
scales
the
address
from
the
bench
was
much
the
shortest
of
the
three
less
exhaustive
than
the
conventional
review
of
a
complicated
case
it
was
a
disquisition
of
conspicuous
clearness
and
impartiality
only
the
salient
points
were
laid
before
the
jury
for
the
last
time
and
in
a
nutshell
but
with
hardly
a
hint
of
the
judge
own
opinion
upon
any
one
of
them
the
expression
of
that
opinion
was
reserved
for
a
point
of
even
greater
import
than
the
value
of
any
separate
piece
of
evidence
if
said
the
judge
the
inferences
and
theory
of
the
prosecution
were
correct
if
this
unhappy
woman
driven
to
desperation
by
her
husband
and
knowing
where
he
kept
his
pistols
had
taken
his
life
with
one
of
them
and
afterwards
manufactured
the
traces
of
a
supposititious
burglary
then
there
was
no
circumstance
connected
with
the
crime
which
could
by
any
possibility
reduce
it
from
murder
to
manslaughter
the
solemnity
of
this
pronouncement
was
felt
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
crowded
court
so
they
were
to
find
her
guilty
of
wilful
murder
or
not
guilty
at
all
every
eye
sped
involuntarily
to
the
slim
black
figure
in
the
dock
and
under
the
gaze
of
all
the
figure
made
the
least
little
bow
a
movement
so
slight
and
so
spontaneous
as
to
suggest
unconsciousness
but
all
the
more
eloquent
on
that
account
yet
to
many
in
court
more
especially
to
the
theatrical
folk
behind
the
man
with
the
white
hair
the
gesture
was
but
one
more
subtle
touch
in
an
exhibition
of
consummate
art
and
nerve
if
they
do
acquit
her
whispered
one
of
these
wiseacres
to
another
she
will
make
her
fortune
on
the
stage
meanwhile
the
judge
was
dealing
at
the
last
with
the
prisoner
evidence
in
her
own
behalf
and
that
mercifully
enough
though
with
less
reticence
than
had
characterized
the
earlier
portions
of
his
address
he
did
not
think
it
possible
or
even
desirable
to
forget
that
this
was
the
evidence
of
a
woman
upon
trial
for
her
life
it
must
not
be
discredited
on
that
account
but
it
was
for
the
jury
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
story
was
one
which
admitted
of
no
corroboration
save
in
unimportant
details
more
than
that
he
would
not
say
it
was
for
them
to
judge
of
that
story
as
they
had
heard
it
for
themselves
on
its
own
merits
but
also
in
relation
to
the
other
evidence
if
the
jury
believed
it
there
was
an
end
of
the
case
if
they
had
any
reasonable
doubt
at
all
the
prisoner
was
entitled
to
the
full
benefit
of
that
doubt
and
they
must
acquit
her
if
on
the
other
hand
the
facts
taken
together
before
and
after
the
murder
brought
the
jury
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
none
other
than
the
prisoner
who
had
committed
the
murder
though
of
course
no
one
was
present
to
see
the
act
committed
they
must
in
duty
to
their
oaths
find
her
guilty
during
the
judge
address
the
short
november
day
had
turned
from
afternoon
to
night
and
a
great
change
had
come
over
the
aspect
of
the
dim
and
dingy
court
opaque
globes
turned
into
flaring
suns
incandescent
burners
revealed
unsuspected
brackets
the
place
was
warmed
and
lighted
for
the
first
time
during
the
week
and
the
effect
of
the
light
and
warmth
was
on
all
the
faces
that
rose
as
one
while
the
judge
sidled
from
the
bench
and
the
jury
filed
out
of
their
box
and
the
prisoner
disappeared
down
the
dock
stairs
for
the
last
time
in
ignorance
of
her
fate
next
moment
there
was
the
buzz
of
talk
that
you
expect
in
a
theatre
between
the
acts
rather
than
in
a
court
of
justice
at
the
solemn
crisis
of
a
solemn
trial
it
was
like
a
with
the
master
called
away
hats
were
put
on
again
in
the
bulging
galleries
hardly
a
tongue
was
still
on
the
bench
a
magnate
and
another
in
exchanged
views
upon
the
enlarged
photographs
which
had
played
so
prominent
a
part
in
the
case
in
the
well
the
barristers
wigs
nodded
or
shook
over
their
pink
blotters
and
their
quill
pens
gentlemen
of
the
press
sharpened
their
pencils
and
indulged
in
prophecy
and
on
their
right
between
the
reporters
and
the
bench
the
privileged
few
the
literary
and
theatrical
elect
discussed
the
situation
with
abnormal
callousness
masking
emotion
with
a
childlike
cynicism
of
sentiment
and
phrase
and
for
once
the
stranger
in
their
midst
the
man
with
more
outward
distinction
than
any
one
of
them
the
unknown
man
with
the
snowy
hair
could
afford
to
listen
to
what
they
had
to
say
no
chance
my
dear
man
not
an
earthly
i
not
so
sure
of
that
will
you
bet
no
hang
it
what
a
beast
you
are
but
i
thought
the
woman
was
speaking
the
truth
you
heard
what
the
judge
said
where
your
corroboration
no
they
ought
never
to
have
let
her
go
into
the
box
i
hear
she
insisted
but
it
has
saved
anybody
yet
the
new
law
then
it
shows
her
pluck
but
not
necessarily
her
innocence
dear
boy
thus
one
shaven
couple
others
had
already
exhausted
the
subject
yes
i
finished
it
down
at
westgate
last
week
satisfied
in
a
way
it
depends
so
much
on
the
cast
these
what
more
or
less
i
must
be
off
dining
out
what
not
going
to
wait
for
the
end
of
the
fourth
act
no
i
late
as
it
is
the
man
was
amused
he
did
not
turn
round
nor
if
he
had
would
he
have
known
the
retreating
gentleman
for
the
most
eminent
of
living
playwrights
but
he
knew
the
reason
for
his
sudden
retreat
a
hush
had
fallen
and
some
one
had
whispered
they
coming
the
chatter
had
died
away
on
the
word
perhaps
it
was
not
so
after
all
but
the
alarm
was
false
there
was
no
sign
of
the
jury
and
the
talk
rose
again
as
the
wind
will
in
a
storm
we
shall
want
a
glass
when
this
is
over
whispered
one
of
the
pair
who
had
argued
about
the
case
and
we
have
it
too
old
man
rejoined
his
friend
the
man
was
grimly
interested
so
this
was
the
way
men
talked
while
waiting
to
hear
a
sentenced
to
death
it
was
worth
knowing
and
this
was
what
the
newspaper
men
would
call
a
low
buzz
an
expectant
hush
this
animated
babble
yet
the
air
was
charged
with
emotion
suppressed
perhaps
but
none
the
less
distinguishable
in
every
voice
within
earshot
a
perspiring
young
pressman
was
informing
his
friends
that
to
come
there
comfortably
you
should
commit
the
murder
yourself
then
they
gave
you
the
royal
box
but
his
teeth
could
be
heard
chattering
through
the
feeble
felicity
the
listener
curled
a
contemptuous
nostril
they
could
joke
and
yet
they
could
feel
he
himself
betrayed
neither
weakness
but
sat
waiting
patiently
and
idly
listening
with
the
same
grim
jaw
and
the
same
inscrutable
eye
with
which
he
had
watched
the
prisoner
and
the
jury
alternately
throughout
the
week
and
when
the
latter
at
last
returned
and
then
the
former
it
was
the
same
subtle
stare
that
he
again
bent
upon
them
both
in
turn
the
jury
had
been
absent
but
forty
minutes
after
all
and
their
expedition
seemed
as
ill
an
omen
as
their
nervous
and
responsible
faces
there
was
a
moment
hush
another
moment
of
prophetic
murmurs
and
then
a
stillness
worthy
of
its
subsequent
description
in
every
newspaper
the
prisoner
was
standing
in
the
front
of
the
dock
a
female
warder
upon
either
hand
the
lightning
pencil
of
the
new
journalist
had
its
will
of
her
at
last
for
minchin
had
dispensed
not
only
with
the
chair
which
she
had
occupied
all
the
week
but
also
with
the
heavy
veil
which
she
had
but
partially
lifted
during
her
brief
sojourn
in
the
and
never
once
in
the
dock
the
veil
was
now
flung
back
over
the
widow
bonnet
peaking
and
falling
like
a
sable
cowl
against
which
the
unearthly
pallor
of
her
face
was
whiter
far
then
that
of
the
merely
dead
just
as
mere
death
was
the
least
part
of
the
fate
confronting
her
yet
she
had
raised
her
veil
to
look
it
fairly
in
the
face
and
the
packed
assembly
marvelled
as
it
gazed
was
that
the
face
that
had
been
hidden
from
them
all
these
days
it
was
not
what
they
had
pictured
beneath
the
proud
defiant
carriage
of
its
concealing
veil
was
that
the
face
of
a
determined
murderess
beautiful
it
was
not
as
they
saw
it
then
but
the
elements
of
beauty
lay
unmistable
beneath
a
white
mist
of
horror
and
of
pain
as
a
lovely
landscape
is
still
lovely
at
its
worst
the
face
was
a
thin
but
perfect
oval
lengthened
a
little
by
depth
of
chin
and
height
of
forehead
as
now
also
by
unnatural
emaciation
and
distress
the
mouth
was
at
once
bloodless
sweet
and
firm
the
eyes
of
a
warm
and
lustrous
brown
brilliant
eloquent
brave
and
hopeless
yes
she
had
no
hope
herself
it
was
plain
enough
at
the
first
glimpse
of
the
deadly
white
uncovered
face
in
the
cruel
glare
of
gas
but
it
became
plainer
still
as
with
sad
unflinching
eyes
she
watched
and
listened
while
for
the
last
time
the
jurymen
answered
to
their
names
now
they
were
done
the
foreman
shifted
nervously
in
his
place
in
the
overstrain
of
the
last
dread
pause
the
crowded
court
felt
hotter
and
lighter
than
ever
it
seemed
to
unite
the
glare
of
a
gin
palace
with
the
temperature
of
a
turkish
bath
gentlemen
are
you
greed
upon
your
verdict
we
are
do
you
find
the
prisoner
guilty
or
not
guilty
not
guilty
there
was
a
simultaneous
gasp
from
a
hundred
throats
a
distinct
cry
from
some
then
the
clerk
of
arraigns
was
seen
to
be
leaning
forward
a
hand
to
his
ear
for
the
foreman
voice
had
broken
with
excitement
and
every
soul
in
court
leaned
forward
too
but
this
time
his
feelings
had
a
different
effect
upon
the
excited
foreman
guilty
he
almost
bawled
dead
silence
then
while
the
clock
ticked
thrice
and
that
is
the
verdict
of
you
all
of
every
one
of
us
the
judge
leant
back
in
his
place
his
eyes
upon
the
desk
before
him
without
a
movement
or
a
gesture
to
strike
the
personal
note
which
had
been
suppressed
with
such
admirable
impartiality
throughout
the
trial
but
it
was
several
moments
before
his
eyes
were
lifted
with
his
voice
let
her
be
discharged
was
all
he
said
even
then
but
he
would
seem
to
have
said
it
at
once
gruffly
angrily
thankfully
disgustedly
with
emotion
and
without
any
emotion
at
all
you
read
the
papers
and
you
take
your
choice
so
rachel
minchin
was
supported
from
the
court
before
the
round
eyes
of
a
hundred
or
two
of
her
in
the
pitiable
state
of
one
who
has
been
condemned
to
die
and
not
set
free
to
live
it
was
as
though
she
still
misunderstood
a
verdict
which
had
filled
most
faces
with
incredulity
but
none
with
an
astonishment
to
equal
her
own
her
white
face
had
leaped
alight
but
not
with
gladness
the
emotion
of
the
week
had
broken
forth
in
an
agony
of
tears
and
so
they
half
led
half
carried
her
from
the
court
she
had
entered
it
for
the
last
time
with
courage
enough
but
it
was
the
wrong
kind
of
courage
and
for
the
one
supreme
moment
sentence
of
life
was
harder
to
bear
than
sentence
of
death
in
a
few
minutes
the
court
was
empty
a
singular
little
theatre
of
pale
varnish
and
tawdry
hangings
still
rather
snug
and
homely
in
the
heat
and
light
of
its
obsolete
gas
and
with
as
little
to
remind
one
of
the
play
as
any
other
theatre
when
the
curtain
is
down
and
the
house
empty
but
there
was
clamor
in
the
corridors
and
hooting
already
in
the
street
nor
was
the
house
really
empty
after
all
one
gentleman
had
not
left
his
place
when
an
attendant
returned
to
put
out
the
lights
the
attendant
pointed
him
out
to
a
constable
at
the
door
both
watched
him
a
few
moments
then
the
attendant
stepped
down
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
the
gentleman
turned
slowly
without
a
start
ah
you
the
man
i
want
to
see
said
he
was
that
the
chief
warder
in
the
dock
him
with
the
beard
said
the
attendant
nodding
well
give
him
this
and
give
it
him
quick
i
wait
up
there
till
he
can
see
me
and
he
pressed
his
card
into
the
attendant
palm
with
a
couple
of
sovereigns
underneath
wants
to
see
the
chief
warder
explained
the
attendant
to
the
constable
at
the
door
he
been
here
all
the
week
mused
the
constable
aloud
i
wonder
who
he
is
name
of
steel
whispered
the
other
consulting
the
card
as
the
gentleman
advanced
up
the
steps
toward
them
the
gaslight
gleaming
in
his
silver
hair
and
throwing
his
firm
features
into
strong
relief
and
not
a
bad
name
for
him
said
the
constable
at
the
door
chapter
iv
the
man
in
the
train
rachel
fought
her
weakness
with
closed
eyes
and
was
complete
mistress
of
herself
when
those
about
her
thought
that
consciousness
alone
was
returning
she
recognized
the
chamber
at
a
glance
it
was
the
one
in
which
generations
of
metropolitan
malefactors
and
a
few
innocent
persons
like
herself
had
waited
for
the
verdict
of
life
or
death
for
her
it
was
life
life
life
and
she
wondered
whether
any
other
of
the
few
had
ever
come
back
to
life
with
so
little
joy
the
female
warders
were
supporting
her
in
a
chair
the
prison
doctor
stood
over
her
with
a
medicine
glass
drink
this
said
he
kindly
but
i
have
been
conscious
all
the
time
never
mind
you
need
it
and
rachel
took
the
restorative
without
more
words
it
did
its
work
the
color
came
back
to
her
face
the
blood
ran
hot
in
her
veins
in
a
minute
she
was
standing
up
without
assistance
and
now
said
rachel
i
shall
not
trespass
further
on
your
kindness
and
i
am
sure
that
you
will
not
wish
to
detain
me
we
can
not
said
the
doctor
with
a
broad
smile
and
a
bow
you
are
as
free
as
air
and
will
perhaps
allow
me
to
be
the
first
to
congratulate
you
at
the
same
time
my
dear
madam
and
quite
apart
from
your
condition
which
is
wonderful
to
me
after
what
you
been
through
at
the
same
time
and
even
with
your
fortitude
i
think
it
would
be
advisable
to
to
wait
a
little
while
the
doctor
raised
his
eyes
and
all
at
once
rachel
heard
overheard
outside
in
the
world
there
was
the
brutal
hooting
of
a
thoughtless
mob
so
that
is
for
me
rachel
set
her
teeth
on
the
contrary
said
the
kindly
doctor
it
may
be
for
the
witnesses
but
crowds
are
fickle
things
and
i
should
strongly
urge
you
not
to
court
a
demonstration
of
one
sort
or
the
other
you
are
best
where
you
are
for
the
time
being
or
at
all
events
somewhere
within
the
precincts
and
meanwhile
your
solicitor
is
waiting
to
add
his
congratulations
to
mine
is
he
indeed
cried
rachel
in
a
voice
as
hard
as
her
eye
why
to
be
sure
rejoined
the
other
taken
somewhat
aback
there
must
be
many
matters
for
discussion
between
you
and
he
at
least
seems
very
anxious
to
discuss
them
in
fact
i
may
say
that
he
is
only
awaiting
my
permission
for
an
immediate
interview
then
let
him
await
mine
exclaimed
rachel
in
a
vindictive
voice
for
which
she
was
apologizing
in
the
next
breath
i
owe
you
much
she
added
if
only
for
your
kindness
and
sympathy
during
these
few
minutes
but
to
him
i
owe
nothing
that
i
can
not
pay
in
cash
he
tried
to
keep
me
from
telling
my
own
story
in
the
box
they
all
did
but
he
was
the
worst
of
all
so
i
certainly
do
not
owe
him
my
life
he
came
to
me
and
he
said
what
he
liked
he
may
have
forgotten
what
he
said
but
i
never
shall
he
would
be
the
first
to
admit
his
error
now
perhaps
but
he
believed
me
guilty
to
the
very
end
and
i
utterly
refuse
to
see
him
then
i
shall
tell
him
so
and
the
good
doctor
disappeared
for
the
nonce
but
was
back
in
a
couple
of
minutes
full
of
the
lawyer
expostulations
what
did
minchin
intend
to
do
where
did
she
propose
to
go
there
were
a
hundred
matters
for
explanation
and
arrangement
her
solicitor
said
she
had
no
friends
and
seemed
himself
most
anxious
to
act
in
that
capacity
rachel
lips
curled
at
the
thought
at
least
said
she
i
have
the
friends
who
guaranteed
his
bill
if
that
has
anything
to
say
to
his
anxiety
but
what
i
mean
to
do
and
where
i
may
go
are
entirely
my
own
affair
and
as
for
the
hundred
matters
he
mentions
he
might
have
spoken
of
them
during
the
week
perhaps
he
thought
it
would
be
waste
of
breath
but
i
should
have
appreciated
the
risk
so
her
solicitor
was
beaten
off
with
all
the
spirit
which
was
one
of
rachel
qualities
but
also
with
the
rashness
which
was
that
defect
the
man
was
indeed
no
ornament
to
his
profession
but
a
practitioner
of
the
pushing
order
who
had
secured
the
case
for
notoriety
and
nothing
else
rachel
soul
sickened
when
she
thought
of
her
interviews
and
especially
her
most
recent
interviews
with
one
whom
she
had
never
seen
before
her
trouble
and
whom
she
devoutly
hoped
never
to
see
again
she
did
not
perceive
that
the
time
had
come
when
the
lawyer
might
have
been
really
useful
to
her
yet
his
messages
left
her
more
alive
to
the
difficulties
that
lay
before
her
as
a
free
woman
and
to
the
immediate
necessity
of
acting
for
herself
once
more
after
all
there
had
been
a
silver
lining
to
the
cloud
under
which
she
had
lain
so
long
others
had
acted
for
her
it
had
been
a
rest
but
conscious
of
her
innocence
and
serene
in
that
consciousness
she
had
prepared
herself
rather
for
another
life
than
for
a
new
lease
of
this
one
and
while
seeking
to
steel
her
soul
to
the
awful
sequel
of
a
conviction
in
the
other
direction
she
had
seldom
looked
beyond
the
consummate
incident
of
an
acquittal
life
seems
a
royal
road
when
it
is
death
that
stares
one
in
the
face
but
already
rachel
saw
the
hills
and
the
pitfalls
for
indeed
they
began
under
her
nose
she
had
no
plans
nor
a
single
soul
to
help
her
to
make
any
in
all
the
world
she
had
no
real
friend
and
yet
with
the
very
independence
to
which
this
isolation
was
largely
due
she
must
pick
and
choose
and
reject
in
the
hour
when
any
friend
would
have
been
better
than
none
in
the
first
ten
minutes
of
the
new
life
which
rachel
minchin
began
with
her
acquittal
she
had
refused
to
see
her
own
solicitor
and
an
unknown
gentleman
whose
card
was
brought
to
her
by
the
chief
warder
himself
with
the
card
was
a
message
which
might
have
inspired
confidence
and
the
same
might
be
said
of
the
address
but
it
was
enough
for
rachel
that
she
knew
no
one
of
the
name
the
chief
warder
one
of
the
kindliest
mortals
displayed
no
little
irritation
under
her
repeated
refusals
but
it
was
the
agent
and
not
the
principal
who
was
so
importunate
and
the
message
was
not
repeated
once
the
former
could
be
induced
to
bear
minchin
answer
the
chief
warder
did
indeed
return
but
it
was
not
to
make
any
further
reference
to
the
mysterious
steel
who
had
craved
an
interview
with
minchin
and
now
the
good
fellow
was
all
smiles
feeling
more
yourself
said
he
and
when
rachel
said
she
was
he
asked
her
to
listen
now
and
there
was
nothing
to
listen
to
the
coast
as
clear
as
the
criminal
court
explained
this
pleasant
official
a
closed
cab
did
it
with
an
officer
on
the
box
and
call
you
another
as
soon
as
you
like
rachel
rose
at
once
it
was
kind
of
you
to
let
me
stay
so
long
she
said
but
i
think
i
will
take
a
cab
thank
you
if
there
an
underground
station
within
reach
and
you
will
kindly
tell
me
the
way
there
blackfriars
bridge
within
five
minutes
but
you
will
have
more
than
you
can
carry
i
have
nothing
worth
taking
away
with
me
said
rachel
except
the
things
i
stand
up
in
but
you
may
give
what
i
leave
to
any
poor
woman
who
cares
to
have
them
and
i
hope
you
will
accept
this
trifle
for
yourself
with
my
deep
gratitude
for
all
your
kindness
indeed
the
man
had
been
kind
and
his
kindness
would
have
continued
to
the
last
had
the
trial
ended
differently
nevertheless
rachel
trifle
was
a
piece
of
gold
and
one
of
her
last
nor
was
this
pure
generosity
there
was
an
untold
joy
in
being
able
to
give
again
it
was
the
first
real
taste
of
freedom
and
in
another
minute
rachel
was
free
oh
but
what
a
miracle
to
hear
her
feet
on
the
now
deserted
pavement
to
see
her
breath
in
the
raw
november
night
and
the
lights
of
ludgate
hill
beyond
rachel
raised
her
veil
to
see
them
better
who
would
look
for
her
afoot
so
near
the
scene
of
her
late
ordeal
and
what
did
it
matter
who
saw
her
and
who
knew
her
now
she
was
innocent
she
could
look
the
whole
world
in
the
face
once
more
oh
to
rub
shoulders
with
the
world
again
a
cab
came
tinkling
up
behind
her
and
rachel
half
thought
of
hailing
it
and
driving
through
the
lighted
town
after
all
but
the
hansom
was
occupied
and
the
impulse
passed
she
put
down
her
veil
and
turned
into
the
stream
without
catching
a
suspicious
eye
why
should
they
suspect
her
and
again
what
did
it
matter
if
they
did
trial
an
verdic
trial
an
verdic
acquittal
o
minchin
trial
an
verdic
everybody
was
buying
the
damp
pink
sheets
rachel
actually
bought
one
herself
and
overheard
the
opinion
of
the
man
in
the
street
without
a
pang
so
she
might
think
herself
lucky
but
she
did
she
did
in
the
reaction
that
had
come
upon
her
with
the
first
mouthful
of
raw
air
in
the
intoxication
of
treading
the
outer
world
again
she
thought
herself
the
luckiest
woman
in
london
and
revelled
rather
than
otherwise
in
the
very
considerations
which
had
appalled
her
in
the
precincts
of
the
court
how
good
after
all
to
be
independent
as
well
as
free
how
great
to
drift
with
the
tide
of
innocent
women
and
men
once
more
one
of
themselves
and
not
even
a
magnet
for
morbid
curiosity
that
would
come
soon
enough
the
present
was
all
the
more
to
be
enjoyed
and
even
the
vagueness
of
the
immediate
future
even
the
lack
of
definite
plans
had
a
glamor
of
their
own
in
eyes
that
were
yet
to
have
their
fill
of
street
lamps
and
shop
windows
and
omnibuses
and
hansom
cabs
the
policeman
under
the
bridge
was
a
joy
in
himself
he
refreshed
rachel
memory
as
to
the
way
without
giving
her
an
unnecessary
look
and
he
called
her
madam
into
the
bargain
after
all
it
was
not
every
policeman
who
had
been
on
duty
at
the
old
bailey
nor
one
in
many
thousands
of
the
population
who
had
gained
admission
to
the
court
yet
if
rachel
had
relieved
the
tedium
of
her
trial
by
using
her
eyes
a
little
more
if
for
example
she
had
condescended
to
look
twice
at
the
handful
of
mere
spectators
beyond
the
reporters
on
her
right
she
could
scarcely
have
failed
to
recognize
the
elderly
man
who
was
at
her
heels
when
she
took
her
ticket
at
blackfriars
bridge
his
white
hair
was
covered
by
his
hat
but
the
face
itself
was
not
one
to
be
forgotten
with
its
fresh
color
its
small
grim
mouth
and
the
glitter
beneath
the
bushy
eyebrows
rachel
however
neither
recognized
nor
looked
again
in
a
few
minutes
she
had
a
better
chance
when
having
entered
an
empty
compartment
in
the
first
class
she
was
joined
by
this
gentleman
as
the
train
began
to
move
rachel
hid
herself
behind
the
newspaper
which
she
had
bought
not
that
she
had
looked
twice
at
her
companion
but
because
at
such
close
quarters
and
in
the
comparatively
fierce
light
of
the
compartment
she
was
terribly
afraid
that
he
might
look
once
too
often
at
her
but
this
fear
passed
from
her
in
the
matchless
fascination
of
reading
and
five
words
in
the
column
minchin
case
verdict
not
guilty
not
guilty
not
guilty
and
to
see
it
in
print
her
eyes
filled
at
the
sight
and
she
dried
them
to
gloat
again
there
were
columns
and
columns
about
the
case
embellished
with
not
unskilful
sketches
of
counsel
addressing
the
jury
and
of
the
judge
in
the
act
of
summing
up
but
rachel
had
listened
to
every
word
from
all
three
and
the
professional
report
was
less
full
and
less
accurate
than
the
one
which
she
carried
in
her
brain
and
would
carry
to
her
grave
not
that
the
speeches
mattered
now
it
was
no
speech
that
had
saved
her
it
was
her
own
story
from
her
own
lips
that
the
lawyers
would
have
closed
rachel
forgave
them
now
she
was
almost
grateful
to
them
for
having
left
it
to
her
to
save
herself
in
spite
of
them
all
so
should
her
perfect
innocence
be
impressed
upon
the
whole
country
as
on
those
twelve
fair
minds
and
once
more
she
pored
upon
the
hurriedly
added
and
line
which
gave
their
verdict
to
the
world
while
the
train
stopped
and
started
only
to
stop
and
start
again
and
what
do
you
think
of
it
madam
the
voice
came
from
the
opposite
corner
of
the
compartment
and
rachel
knew
it
for
that
of
the
gentleman
who
had
jumped
in
at
the
last
moment
at
blackfriars
bridge
it
was
charing
cross
that
they
were
leaving
now
and
the
door
had
not
opened
at
that
station
or
the
last
rachel
sat
breathless
behind
her
evening
paper
not
to
answer
might
be
to
fasten
suspicion
upon
her
widow
weeds
and
for
all
her
right
to
look
mankind
in
the
face
she
shrank
instinctively
from
immediate
recognition
then
in
a
clap
came
the
temptation
to
discuss
her
own
case
with
the
owner
of
a
voice
at
once
confident
and
courtly
and
subtly
reminiscent
of
her
native
colony
where
it
is
no
affront
for
stranger
to
speak
to
stranger
without
introduction
or
excuse
rachel
hesitation
lasted
perhaps
a
couple
of
seconds
and
then
her
paper
lay
across
her
lap
of
what
she
asked
with
some
presence
of
mind
for
she
had
never
an
instant
doubt
that
the
question
referred
to
the
topic
of
the
hour
we
were
reading
the
same
paper
replied
the
questioner
with
perfect
courtesy
it
only
struck
me
that
we
might
both
be
reading
the
same
thing
and
feeling
equally
amazed
at
the
verdict
you
mean
in
the
minchin
case
said
rachel
steadily
and
without
the
least
interrogation
in
her
tone
yes
i
was
reading
it
as
i
suppose
everybody
is
but
i
disagree
with
you
about
the
verdict
the
young
widow
manner
was
as
downright
as
her
words
there
was
a
sudden
raising
of
the
bushy
eyebrows
in
the
opposite
corner
a
brief
opening
of
the
black
eyes
underneath
pardon
me
said
the
gentleman
breaking
into
a
smile
i
was
not
aware
that
i
had
expressed
an
opinion
on
that
point
i
understood
you
were
amazed
said
rachel
dryly
and
are
not
you
cried
the
other
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
were
prepared
for
an
acquittal
i
was
prepared
for
anything
replied
rachel
returning
a
peculiarly
penetrating
stare
with
one
at
least
as
steady
and
yet
holding
her
breath
for
very
fear
lest
this
stranger
had
found
her
out
until
his
next
words
allayed
the
suspicion
madam
have
you
followed
the
case
indeed
i
have
sighed
honest
rachel
and
as
a
woman
you
believe
this
woman
innocent
i
do
it
was
hard
enough
to
say
no
more
than
that
but
rachel
was
very
fresh
from
her
great
lesson
in
it
is
easy
to
see
that
you
do
not
she
merely
permitted
herself
to
add
on
the
contrary
said
he
with
great
precision
on
the
contrary
my
dear
madam
i
believe
this
poor
lady
to
be
as
innocent
as
yourself
again
their
eyes
were
locked
again
rachel
drew
the
only
inference
from
so
pointed
a
pronouncement
and
yet
again
was
the
impression
shaken
by
her
companion
next
words
but
i
really
have
no
right
to
an
opinion
said
he
since
unlike
you
i
can
not
claim
to
have
read
the
case
nor
is
that
the
interesting
thing
now
the
stations
had
come
and
gone
until
now
they
were
at
victoria
the
speaker
looked
out
of
the
window
until
they
were
off
again
and
off
by
themselves
as
before
the
interesting
thing
to
me
is
not
what
this
poor
lady
has
or
has
not
done
but
what
on
earth
she
is
going
to
do
now
he
looked
at
her
again
and
now
rachel
was
sure
but
there
was
a
kindness
in
his
look
that
did
away
both
with
resentment
and
regret
they
say
she
has
literally
no
friends
in
england
he
went
on
with
unconcealed
concern
that
is
incredible
and
yet
if
there
be
any
truth
in
it
what
a
terrible
position
i
fear
that
everybody
will
not
share
your
conviction
and
i
may
add
my
own
if
one
can
judge
thus
early
by
what
one
has
heard
and
seen
for
oneself
this
verdict
is
a
personal
disappointment
to
the
always
bloodthirsty
man
in
the
street
then
god
help
the
poor
lady
if
he
spots
her
i
only
hope
she
will
not
give
him
a
chance
and
now
rachel
not
only
knew
that
he
knew
but
that
he
wished
to
apprise
her
of
his
knowledge
without
confessing
it
in
so
many
words
so
he
would
spare
her
that
embarrassment
and
would
help
her
if
he
could
this
utter
stranger
yet
she
saw
it
in
his
face
she
heard
it
in
his
voice
and
becoming
gradually
alive
to
his
will
to
help
her
as
she
instinctively
was
to
his
power
she
had
herself
the
will
to
consult
one
whose
good
intention
and
better
tact
were
alike
obvious
mystery
there
was
in
her
meeting
with
this
man
something
told
her
that
it
was
no
accident
on
his
side
she
began
to
wonder
whether
she
had
not
seen
him
before
and
while
she
wondered
he
came
and
sat
opposite
to
her
and
went
on
speaking
in
a
lower
voice
his
dark
eyes
fixed
on
hers
if
minchin
wants
a
friend
and
i
think
she
must
if
ever
she
did
or
will
well
if
she
does
i
for
one
would
be
her
friend
if
she
would
trust
me
the
last
words
were
the
lowest
of
all
and
in
the
tone
of
them
there
was
a
timbre
which
thrilled
rachel
as
the
dark
eyes
fascinated
her
she
began
to
feel
a
strange
repugnance
and
yet
more
strange
attraction
but
to
the
latter
her
independence
gave
instant
battle
a
battle
the
easier
to
fight
since
the
next
station
was
rachel
destination
do
you
think
she
would
trust
me
he
almost
whispered
leaning
towards
her
as
a
woman
do
you
think
she
might
as
rachel
hesitated
the
carriages
began
to
groan
beneath
the
brake
and
her
hesitation
was
at
an
end
so
also
was
her
limited
capacity
for
pretence
she
sat
more
upright
in
her
corner
her
shoulders
fell
in
angles
and
beneath
the
veil
which
she
had
raised
to
read
her
paper
her
eyes
carried
the
war
of
interrogation
into
the
enemy
country
i
seem
to
have
seen
you
before
said
rachel
cool
of
tongue
but
hot
at
heart
i
think
it
very
possible
that
you
have
were
you
at
the
trial
from
first
to
last
the
pause
that
followed
was
really
broken
by
the
lights
of
sloane
square
station
you
know
me
said
rachel
hurriedly
i
have
seen
that
for
some
time
may
i
ask
if
you
are
mr
steel
i
am
the
steel
who
sent
me
his
card
after
the
trial
steel
bowed
as
a
perfect
stranger
as
a
perfect
stranger
who
had
watched
you
for
a
whole
long
week
in
court
rachel
ignored
the
relative
clause
and
because
i
would
not
see
you
steel
you
have
followed
me
and
forced
yourself
upon
me
the
train
stopped
and
rachel
rose
you
will
gather
my
motives
when
you
recall
our
conversation
observed
steel
and
he
opened
the
door
for
her
but
rachel
turned
to
him
before
alighting
steel
said
she
i
am
quite
sure
that
you
mean
kindly
and
well
and
that
i
above
all
women
should
feel
supremely
grateful
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
you
are
unjust
to
the
man
in
the
street
better
give
him
a
trial
said
steel
coldly
enough
in
his
turn
i
should
prefer
to
rejoined
rachel
getting
out
and
there
was
no
little
sting
in
the
intonation
of
the
verb
but
steel
was
left
smiling
and
nodding
very
confidently
to
himself
chapter
v
the
man
in
the
street
rachel
perturbation
was
only
the
greater
from
her
success
in
concealing
or
at
least
suppressing
it
during
the
actual
process
of
this
singular
interview
you
may
hold
your
breath
without
moving
a
muscle
but
the
muscles
will
make
up
for
it
when
their
turn
comes
and
it
was
so
with
rachel
and
her
nerves
they
rose
upon
her
even
on
the
platform
and
she
climbed
the
many
stairs
in
a
tremor
from
head
to
foot
and
at
the
top
in
the
open
night
and
at
all
the
many
corners
of
a
square
that
is
nothing
of
the
kind
from
hoarse
throat
and
on
fluttering
placard
it
was
trial
and
verdict
or
sensational
verdict
at
the
old
bailey
here
as
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
but
now
all
rachel
thoughts
were
of
this
mysterious
steel
of
his
inexplicable
behavior
towards
her
and
of
her
own
attitude
towards
him
yet
when
all
was
said
or
when
all
that
had
been
said
could
be
remembered
would
his
behavior
be
found
so
very
inexplicable
rachel
was
not
devoid
of
a
proper
vanity
albeit
that
night
she
had
probably
less
than
most
women
with
a
tithe
of
her
personal
attractions
and
yet
upon
reflection
she
could
conceive
but
one
explanation
of
such
conduct
in
an
elderly
man
there
is
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
quoted
rachel
to
herself
and
it
was
remarkable
that
until
this
moment
she
had
never
thought
of
steel
as
either
elderly
or
old
his
eyes
were
young
his
voice
was
young
she
could
hear
him
and
see
him
still
so
the
strong
impression
was
not
all
on
one
side
no
more
it
would
seem
was
the
fascination
rachel
indeed
owned
to
no
such
feeling
even
in
her
inmost
heart
but
she
did
begin
to
blame
herself
alike
for
her
reception
of
advances
which
might
well
have
been
dictated
by
mere
eccentric
benevolence
and
for
her
readiness
now
to
put
another
construction
upon
them
and
all
this
time
she
was
threading
the
streets
of
chelsea
at
a
pace
suggestive
of
a
destination
and
a
purpose
while
in
her
mind
she
did
nothing
but
look
back
impulsive
by
nature
rachel
had
also
the
courage
of
each
impulse
while
it
lasted
on
the
other
hand
if
quick
to
act
she
was
only
too
ready
to
regret
like
many
another
whose
is
largely
on
the
surface
an
achievement
of
the
will
and
not
the
gift
of
a
temperament
she
usually
paid
for
a
display
of
spirit
with
the
most
dispiriting
reaction
and
this
was
precisely
the
case
in
point
rachel
was
ashamed
alike
of
her
rudeness
and
her
vanity
the
latter
she
traced
to
its
source
it
was
inspired
by
vague
memories
of
other
women
who
had
been
through
the
same
ordeal
as
herself
one
had
been
handed
a
bouquet
in
the
dock
another
had
been
overwhelmed
by
proposals
of
marriage
rachel
herself
had
received
letters
of
which
the
first
line
was
enough
but
there
had
been
no
letter
from
steel
ah
but
he
had
attended
her
trial
she
remembered
him
now
his
continual
presence
had
impressed
itself
very
subtly
upon
her
mind
without
the
definite
memory
of
a
single
glance
and
after
the
trial
he
sent
her
his
card
he
dogged
her
in
the
train
what
was
she
to
think
there
was
the
voice
in
which
he
had
offered
her
his
aid
there
was
the
look
in
his
eyes
there
was
the
delicate
indirectness
of
that
offer
a
year
or
two
ago
with
all
her
independence
rachel
would
not
have
been
so
ready
to
repel
one
whose
advances
however
unwarrantable
in
themselves
were
yet
marked
by
so
many
evidences
of
sympathy
and
consideration
she
had
not
always
been
suspicious
and
repellent
and
she
sighed
to
think
how
sadly
she
must
have
changed
even
before
the
nightmare
of
the
last
few
weeks
but
a
more
poignant
reminder
of
her
married
life
was
now
in
store
for
rachel
minchin
she
had
come
to
chelsea
because
it
was
the
only
portion
of
the
town
in
which
she
had
the
semblance
of
a
friend
but
there
did
live
in
tite
street
a
young
couple
with
whom
the
minchins
had
at
one
time
been
on
friendly
terms
that
was
in
the
day
of
plenty
and
extravagance
and
the
acquaintance
formed
at
an
hotel
in
the
trossachs
had
not
ripened
in
town
as
the
two
wives
could
have
wished
it
was
carrington
however
who
had
found
the
minchins
their
furnished
house
while
her
husband
certainly
interested
himself
in
rachel
defence
carrington
was
a
barrister
who
never
himself
touched
criminal
work
but
he
had
spoken
to
a
friend
who
did
to
wit
the
brilliant
terror
of
female
witnesses
and
caustic
critic
of
the
police
to
whom
rachel
owed
so
little
but
to
carrington
himself
she
owed
much
more
indeed
than
she
cared
to
calculate
for
he
was
not
a
man
whom
she
liked
she
wished
to
thank
him
for
his
kindness
to
give
certain
undertakings
and
to
ask
his
advice
but
it
was
carrington
whom
she
really
hoped
to
see
there
was
a
good
heart
or
rachel
was
much
mistaken
they
would
have
seen
more
of
each
other
if
carrington
had
had
her
way
rachel
remembered
her
on
the
occasion
of
the
solitary
visit
she
had
received
at
holloway
for
carrington
had
been
the
visitor
do
tell
jim
she
had
said
when
you
get
off
and
come
to
see
us
and
she
had
kissed
her
captive
sister
in
a
way
that
made
poor
rachel
sometimes
think
she
had
a
friend
in
england
after
all
but
that
was
before
her
committal
and
thereafter
from
that
quarter
not
a
word
it
was
not
carrington
whom
rachel
blamed
however
and
those
last
words
of
hers
implied
an
invitation
which
had
never
been
withdrawn
but
invitation
or
no
invitation
friend
or
no
friend
carrington
she
would
have
to
see
and
even
he
would
be
different
now
that
he
knew
she
was
innocent
and
if
it
was
easy
to
see
what
he
had
believed
of
her
before
well
so
much
the
more
credit
to
him
for
what
he
had
done
so
rachel
had
decided
before
quitting
the
precincts
of
the
old
bailey
but
her
subsequent
experiences
in
street
and
train
so
absorbed
her
that
she
was
full
of
the
interview
that
was
over
when
she
ought
to
have
been
preparing
for
the
one
still
before
her
and
in
her
absence
of
mind
the
force
of
habit
had
taken
advantage
of
her
instead
of
going
on
to
tite
street
she
turned
too
soon
and
turned
again
and
was
now
appalled
to
find
herself
in
the
very
street
in
which
her
husband
had
met
his
death
the
little
street
was
as
quiet
as
ever
rachel
stood
quite
still
and
for
the
moment
she
was
the
only
person
in
it
she
stole
up
to
the
house
the
blinds
were
down
and
it
was
in
darkness
otherwise
all
was
as
she
remembered
it
only
too
well
her
breath
came
quickly
it
was
a
strange
trick
her
feet
had
played
her
bringing
her
here
against
her
will
yet
she
had
thought
of
coming
as
a
last
resort
the
furnished
house
should
be
hers
for
some
months
yet
it
had
been
taken
for
six
months
from
july
and
this
was
only
the
end
of
november
at
the
worst
if
no
one
would
take
her
in
she
shuddered
at
the
unfinished
thought
and
yet
there
was
something
in
it
that
appealed
to
rachel
to
go
back
there
if
only
for
the
shortest
time
to
show
her
face
openly
where
it
was
known
not
to
slink
and
hide
as
though
she
were
really
guilty
that
might
give
her
back
her
that
might
make
others
respect
her
too
but
could
she
do
it
even
if
she
would
could
she
bring
herself
to
set
foot
inside
that
house
again
rachel
felt
tremulously
in
her
pocket
there
had
been
more
keys
than
one
and
that
which
had
been
in
her
possession
when
she
was
arrested
was
in
it
still
nobody
had
asked
her
for
it
she
had
kept
it
for
this
dare
she
use
it
after
all
the
street
was
still
empty
it
is
the
quietest
little
street
in
chelsea
there
would
never
be
a
better
chance
rachel
crept
up
the
steps
if
she
should
be
seen
she
was
not
but
a
footstep
rang
somewhere
in
the
night
and
on
that
the
key
was
fitted
and
the
door
opened
without
another
moment
hesitation
rachel
entered
the
door
shut
noisily
behind
her
and
then
her
own
step
rang
in
turn
upon
the
floor
it
was
bare
boards
and
as
rachel
felt
her
way
to
the
electric
switches
beyond
the
door
her
fingers
missed
the
pictures
on
the
walls
this
prepared
her
for
what
she
found
when
the
white
light
sprang
out
above
her
head
the
house
had
been
dismantled
not
a
stick
in
the
rooms
not
so
much
as
a
on
the
stairs
nor
a
blind
to
the
window
at
their
head
the
furniture
removed
while
the
use
of
it
belonged
legally
to
her
had
they
made
so
sure
of
her
conviction
as
all
that
rachel
blood
came
straight
from
zero
to
the
boil
this
was
monstrous
this
was
illegal
and
wicked
the
house
was
hers
for
other
two
months
and
there
were
things
of
hers
in
it
she
had
left
everything
behind
her
if
they
had
been
removed
then
this
outrage
was
little
short
of
felony
and
she
would
invoke
the
law
from
whose
clutches
she
herself
had
escaped
rachel
had
expected
to
be
terrified
in
the
house
she
was
filled
insted
with
anger
and
indignation
it
was
as
she
expected
not
a
trunk
had
been
left
and
the
removal
had
taken
place
that
very
week
this
would
account
for
the
electric
light
being
still
intact
rachel
discovered
it
by
picking
up
a
crumpled
newspaper
which
seemed
to
have
contained
bread
and
cheese
it
did
contain
a
report
of
the
first
day
of
the
trial
they
might
have
waited
till
her
trial
was
over
they
should
suffer
for
their
impatience
it
was
their
turn
so
angry
was
rachel
that
her
own
room
wounded
her
with
no
memories
of
the
past
it
was
an
empty
room
and
nothing
more
and
only
on
her
return
to
the
lower
floor
did
that
last
dread
night
come
back
to
her
in
all
its
horror
and
all
its
pitifulness
the
double
doors
of
the
late
professor
rachel
forgot
her
grudge
against
his
widow
she
pulled
the
outer
door
and
pushed
the
inner
one
just
as
she
had
done
in
the
small
hours
of
that
fatal
morning
but
this
time
all
was
darkness
within
she
had
to
put
on
the
electric
light
for
herself
the
necessity
she
could
not
have
explained
but
it
existed
in
her
mind
she
must
see
the
room
again
and
the
first
thing
she
saw
was
that
the
window
was
broken
still
rachel
looked
at
it
more
closely
than
she
had
done
on
the
morning
when
she
had
given
her
incriminating
opinion
to
the
police
and
the
longer
she
looked
the
less
reason
did
she
see
to
alter
that
opinion
the
broken
glass
might
have
been
placed
upon
the
sill
in
order
to
promote
the
very
theory
which
had
been
so
gullibly
adopted
by
the
police
and
the
watch
and
chain
hidden
in
the
chimney
for
the
same
purpose
they
might
have
hanged
the
man
who
kept
them
and
surely
this
was
not
the
first
thief
who
had
slunk
away
after
the
committal
of
a
crime
infinitely
greater
than
the
one
contemplated
rachel
had
never
wavered
in
these
ideas
but
neither
had
she
dwelt
on
them
to
any
extent
and
now
they
came
one
instant
only
to
go
the
next
her
husband
was
dead
that
was
once
more
the
paramount
thought
and
she
his
widow
had
been
acquitted
on
a
charge
of
murdering
him
but
for
the
moment
she
was
thinking
only
of
him
and
her
eyes
hung
over
the
spot
where
she
had
seen
him
sitting
dead
once
without
dreaming
it
and
soon
they
filled
perhaps
she
was
remembering
all
that
had
been
good
in
him
perhaps
all
that
had
been
evil
in
herself
her
lips
quivered
and
her
eyes
filled
but
it
was
hard
to
pity
one
who
was
at
rest
hard
for
her
with
the
world
to
face
afresh
that
night
without
a
single
friend
the
carringtons
well
she
would
see
and
now
she
had
a
very
definite
point
upon
which
to
consult
carrington
that
helped
her
and
she
went
quietly
and
unseen
as
she
had
come
there
was
still
a
light
in
the
windows
of
the
tite
street
house
strong
lights
and
voices
it
was
the
for
the
minchins
had
dined
there
once
and
the
voices
did
not
include
a
feminine
one
that
rachel
could
perceive
if
there
were
people
dining
with
them
the
ladies
must
have
gone
upstairs
and
carrington
was
the
woman
to
see
rachel
for
five
minutes
and
the
one
woman
in
england
to
whom
she
could
turn
it
was
an
opportunity
not
to
miss
she
had
not
the
courage
to
let
it
pass
and
yet
it
required
almost
as
much
to
ring
the
bell
and
even
as
she
rang
but
not
until
that
moment
did
rachel
recognize
and
admit
to
herself
the
motive
which
had
brought
her
to
that
door
it
was
not
to
obtain
the
advice
of
a
clever
man
it
was
the
sympathy
of
another
woman
that
she
needed
that
night
more
than
anything
else
in
all
the
world
she
was
shown
at
once
into
the
study
behind
the
and
immediately
the
voices
in
the
latter
ceased
this
was
ominous
it
was
for
carrington
that
rachel
had
asked
and
the
omen
was
instantly
fulfilled
it
was
carrington
who
came
into
the
room
dark
dapper
and
duskily
flushed
with
his
own
hospitality
but
without
the
genial
front
which
rachel
had
liked
best
in
him
his
voice
also
when
he
had
carefully
shut
the
door
behind
him
was
unnaturally
stiff
i
congratulate
you
he
said
with
a
bow
but
nothing
more
and
rachel
saw
there
and
then
how
it
was
to
be
for
with
her
at
least
this
man
had
never
been
stiff
before
having
indeed
offended
her
with
his
familiarity
at
the
time
when
her
husband
and
he
were
best
friends
i
owe
it
very
largely
to
you
faltered
rachel
how
can
i
thank
you
carrington
said
it
was
not
necessary
then
i
only
hope
said
rachel
on
one
of
her
impulses
that
you
disagree
with
the
verdict
i
did
read
the
case
replied
carrington
glibly
and
with
neither
more
nor
less
of
the
contemptuous
superiority
with
which
he
would
have
referred
to
any
other
old
bailey
trial
but
the
man
himself
was
quick
to
see
the
brutality
of
such
a
statement
and
quicker
yet
to
tone
it
down
it
was
necessary
he
added
with
a
touch
of
the
early
manner
which
she
had
never
liked
you
see
i
knew
you
the
insincerity
was
so
obvious
that
rachel
could
scarcely
bring
herself
to
confess
that
she
had
come
to
ask
his
advice
what
was
the
point
he
said
to
that
so
crisply
that
the
only
point
which
rachel
could
think
of
was
the
fresh
raw
grievance
of
the
empty
house
did
your
solicitor
tell
you
asked
carrington
he
came
to
me
about
it
but
i
suppose
rachel
knew
well
what
he
supposed
he
should
have
told
you
added
carrington
at
any
rate
the
rent
was
only
paid
for
half
the
term
quite
right
the
usual
way
the
permanent
tenant
wanted
to
be
done
with
the
house
altogether
and
that
entitled
her
to
take
her
things
out
no
i
afraid
you
have
no
grievance
there
mrs
minchin
and
pray
demanded
rachel
where
are
my
things
ah
your
solicitor
will
tell
you
that
when
you
give
him
the
chance
he
very
properly
would
not
care
to
bother
you
about
trifles
until
the
case
against
you
was
satisfactorily
disposed
of
by
the
way
i
hope
you
mind
my
cigar
we
were
smoking
in
the
next
room
i
have
taken
you
from
your
guests
said
rachel
miserably
i
know
i
ought
not
to
have
come
at
such
an
hour
carrington
did
not
contradict
her
but
there
seemed
so
much
to
speak
about
she
went
desperately
on
there
are
the
money
matters
and
and
if
you
will
come
to
my
chambers
said
carrington
i
shall
be
delighted
to
go
into
things
with
you
and
to
advise
you
to
the
best
of
my
ability
if
you
could
manage
to
come
at
nine
on
monday
morning
i
would
be
there
early
and
could
give
you
twenty
minutes
he
wrote
down
the
address
and
handing
it
to
rachel
rang
the
bell
this
drove
her
to
despair
evidently
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
she
was
faint
with
weariness
and
hunger
that
she
had
nowhere
to
go
for
the
night
and
not
the
price
of
a
decent
meal
much
less
a
bed
in
her
purse
and
even
now
her
pride
prevented
her
from
telling
the
truth
but
it
would
not
silence
her
supreme
desire
oh
she
cried
oh
may
i
not
speak
to
your
wife
not
if
you
do
mind
replied
carrington
with
his
bow
and
smile
we
ca
both
desert
our
guests
only
for
a
minute
pleaded
rachel
i
would
keep
her
more
not
he
repeated
with
a
broader
smile
a
clearer
enunciation
and
a
decision
so
obviously
irrevocable
that
rachel
said
no
more
but
she
would
not
see
the
hand
that
he
could
afford
to
hold
out
to
her
now
and
as
for
going
near
his
chambers
never
never
though
she
starved
no
i
would
have
kept
her
she
sobbed
in
the
street
but
she
would
have
kept
me
i
know
her
i
know
her
she
would
have
had
pity
on
me
in
spite
of
him
but
now
i
can
never
go
near
either
of
them
again
then
where
was
she
to
go
god
knew
no
respectable
hotel
would
take
her
in
without
luggage
or
a
deposit
what
was
she
to
do
but
while
she
wondered
her
feet
were
carrying
her
once
more
in
the
old
direction
and
as
she
walked
an
idea
came
she
was
very
near
the
fatal
little
street
at
the
time
she
turned
about
and
then
to
the
left
in
a
few
moments
she
was
timorously
knocking
at
the
door
of
a
house
with
a
card
in
the
window
it
you
cried
the
woman
who
came
almost
shutting
the
door
in
rachel
face
leaving
just
space
enough
for
her
own
you
have
a
room
to
let
said
rachel
steadily
but
not
to
you
said
the
woman
quickly
and
rachel
was
not
surprised
the
other
was
so
pale
so
strangely
agitated
but
why
she
asked
i
have
been
acquitted
thanks
partly
to
your
own
evidence
and
yet
you
of
all
women
will
not
take
me
in
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
actually
think
i
did
it
still
rachel
fully
expected
an
affirmative
she
was
prepared
for
that
opinion
now
from
all
the
world
but
for
once
a
surprise
was
in
store
for
her
the
pale
woman
shifted
her
eyes
then
raised
them
doggedly
and
the
look
in
them
brought
a
sudden
glow
to
rachel
heart
no
i
do
think
that
and
never
did
said
the
one
independent
witness
for
the
defence
but
others
do
and
i
am
too
near
where
it
happened
it
might
empty
my
house
and
keep
it
empty
rachel
seized
her
hand
never
mind
never
mind
she
whispered
it
is
better
ten
thousand
times
that
you
should
believe
in
me
that
any
woman
should
thank
you
and
god
bless
you
for
that
she
was
turning
away
when
she
faced
about
upon
the
steps
gazing
past
the
woman
who
believed
in
her
along
the
passage
beyond
an
unspoken
question
beneath
the
tears
in
her
eyes
he
is
not
here
said
the
landlady
quickly
but
he
did
get
over
it
so
we
hope
but
he
was
at
death
door
that
morning
and
for
days
and
weeks
now
he
abroad
again
i
sure
i
do
know
where
rachel
said
and
this
time
the
door
not
only
shut
before
she
had
time
to
change
her
mind
again
but
she
heard
the
bolts
shot
as
she
reached
the
pavement
the
fact
did
not
strike
her
she
was
thinking
for
a
moment
of
the
innocent
young
foreigner
who
had
brought
matters
to
a
crisis
between
her
husband
and
herself
on
the
whole
she
was
glad
that
he
was
not
in
england
yet
there
would
have
been
one
friend
and
now
her
own
case
was
really
desperate
it
was
late
at
night
she
was
famished
and
worn
out
in
body
and
mind
nor
could
she
see
the
slightest
prospect
of
a
lodging
for
the
night
and
that
she
would
have
had
in
the
condemned
cell
with
food
and
warmth
and
rest
and
the
blessed
certainty
of
a
speedy
issue
out
of
all
her
afflictions
it
was
a
bitter
irony
after
all
this
acquittal
there
was
but
one
place
for
her
now
she
would
perish
there
of
cold
and
horror
but
she
might
buy
something
to
eat
and
take
it
with
her
and
at
least
she
could
rest
and
would
be
alone
in
the
empty
house
the
house
of
misery
and
murder
that
was
yet
the
one
shelter
that
she
knew
of
in
all
london
she
crept
to
the
king
road
and
returned
with
a
few
sandwiches
walking
better
in
her
eagerness
to
break
a
fast
which
she
had
only
felt
since
excitement
had
given
place
to
despair
but
now
it
was
making
her
faint
and
and
she
hurried
weary
though
she
was
but
in
the
little
street
itself
she
stood
aghast
a
crowd
filled
it
the
crowd
stood
before
the
empty
house
of
sorrow
and
of
crime
and
in
a
moment
rachel
saw
the
cause
it
was
her
own
fault
she
had
left
the
light
burning
in
the
upper
room
the
bedroom
on
the
second
floor
rachel
joined
the
skirts
of
the
crowd
drawn
by
an
irresistible
fascination
and
listened
to
what
was
being
said
all
eyes
were
upon
the
lighted
window
of
the
bedroom
watching
for
herself
as
she
soon
discovered
and
this
made
her
doubly
safe
where
she
stood
behind
the
press
she
up
there
i
tell
yer
said
one
not
her
it
a
ghost
her
ghost
then
but
vere
a
chap
wot
sore
fice
to
fice
in
the
next
street
an
followed
and
the
door
go
an
come
back
wiv
pals
vere
was
vat
light
let
aht
of

she
ai
no
right
there
no
the
condemned
cell
the
plice
for
give
us
a
stone
afore
the
copper
comes
and
rachel
saw
the
first
stone
flung
and
heard
the
first
glass
break
and
within
a
very
few
minutes
there
was
not
a
whole
pane
left
in
the
front
of
the
house
but
that
was
all
the
damage
which
rachel
herself
saw
done
a
hand
touched
her
lightly
on
the
shoulder
do
you
still
pin
your
faith
to
the
man
in
the
street
said
a
voice
and
though
she
had
heard
it
for
the
first
time
that
very
evening
it
was
a
voice
that
rachel
seemed
to
have
known
all
her
life
chapter
vi
a
peripatetic
providence
do
you
still
pin
your
faith
to
the
man
in
the
street
it
was
steel
who
stood
at
rachel
elbow
repeating
his
question
word
for
word
but
he
did
not
repeat
it
in
the
same
tone
there
was
an
earnest
note
in
the
lowered
voice
an
unspoken
appeal
to
her
to
admit
the
truth
and
be
done
with
proud
pretence
and
indeed
the
pride
had
gone
out
of
rachel
at
sight
of
him
a
delicious
sense
of
safety
filled
her
heart
instead
she
was
as
one
drowning
and
here
was
a
strong
swimmer
come
to
her
rescue
in
the
nick
of
time
what
did
it
matter
who
or
what
he
was
she
felt
that
he
was
strong
to
save
yet
as
the
nearly
drowned
do
struggle
with
their
saviours
so
rachel
must
fence
instinctively
with
hers
i
never
did
pin
my
faith
to
him
said
she
yet
see
the
risk
that
you
are
running
if
he
turns
round
if
any
one
of
them
turns
round
and
recognizes
you
listen
to
that
it
was
only
the
second
window
but
a
third
and
a
fourth
followed
like
shots
from
the
same
revolver
rachel
winced
for
god
sake
come
away
he
whispered
sternly
and
rachel
did
come
a
few
yards
before
a
flicker
of
her
spirit
called
a
halt
why
should
i
run
away
she
demanded
in
sudden
tears
of
mortification
and
of
weakness
combined
i
am
innocent
so
why
should
i
because
they
do
like
innocent
people
and
there
appear
to
be
no
police
in
these
parts
and
if
you
fall
into
their
hands
well
it
would
be
better
for
you
if
you
had
been
found
guilty
and
were
safe
and
sound
in
newgate
now
that
was
exactly
what
rachel
had
felt
herself
she
took
a
few
steps
more
but
still
with
reluctance
and
irresolution
and
once
round
the
nearest
corner
and
out
of
that
hateful
street
for
ever
she
turned
to
her
companion
in
unconcealed
despair
but
what
am
i
to
do
she
cried
but
where
am
i
to
turn
minchin
said
steel
can
you
not
really
trust
me
yet
he
stood
before
her
under
a
street
lamp
handsome
still
upright
for
all
his
years
strong
as
fate
itself
and
surely
kinder
than
any
fate
which
rachel
minchin
had
yet
met
with
in
the
course
of
her
short
but
checkered
life
and
yet
and
yet
she
trusted
and
distrusted
him
too
i
can
and
i
can
not
she
sighed
and
even
with
the
words
one
reason
occurred
to
her
you
have
followed
me
you
see
after
all
i
admit
it
he
replied
and
without
a
particle
of
shame
my
dear
lady
i
was
not
going
to
lose
sight
of
you
and
why
not
because
i
foresaw
what
might
happen
and
may
happen
still
nay
madam
it
will
if
you
continue
to
let
your
pride
sit
upon
your
common
sense
do
you
hear
them
now
that
means
the
police
and
when
they
dispersed
they
come
this
way
to
king
road
any
moment
they
may
be
upon
us
and
there
a
hansom
dropped
from
heaven
he
raised
his
umbrella
the
bell
tinkled
the
two
red
eyes
dilated
and
widened
in
the
night
then
with
a
clatter
the
horse
was
pulled
up
beside
the
curb
and
steel
spread
his
hand
before
the
muddy
wheel
be
sensible
he
whispered
and
jump
in
in
a
hansom
you
can
see
where
you
are
going
in
a
hansom
you
can
speak
to
the
driver
or
attract
the
attention
of
any
decent
person
on
the
sidewalk
ah
you
will
trust
me
so
far
at
last
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
where
to
sir
asked
the
cabman
through
the
roof
and
rachel
listened
with
languid
curiosity
but
that
was
all
she
had
put
herself
in
this
man
hands
resistance
was
at
an
end
and
a
reckless
indifference
to
her
fate
the
new
attitude
of
a
soul
as
utterly
overtaxed
and
exhausted
as
its
tired
tenement
of
clay
brook
street
said
steel
after
a
moment
pause
and
for
a
double
fare
we
shall
be
there
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
added
reassuringly
as
the
slammed
and
you
will
find
everything
ready
for
you
beginning
with
something
to
eat
i
at
all
events
anticipated
the
verdict
if
you
do
believe
me
you
will
when
we
get
there
for
they
have
been
ready
for
you
all
day
do
you
know
hotel
by
the
way
only
by
name
said
rachel
wearily
i
glad
to
hear
it
pursued
steel
for
i
think
you
will
be
pleased
it
is
not
like
the
ordinary
run
of
hotels
your
rooms
are
your
castle
regular
flat
and
you
need
see
another
soul
if
you
do
like
i
am
staying
in
the
hotel
myself
for
example
but
you
shall
not
set
eyes
on
me
for
a
week
unless
you
wish
to
but
i
do
understand
began
rachel
roused
a
little
from
her
apathy
she
was
not
suffered
to
proceed
nor
are
you
to
attempt
to
do
so
said
her
companion
until
morning
if
you
feel
equal
to
it
then
i
shall
crave
an
audience
and
you
shall
hear
what
i
have
got
to
say
but
first
let
me
beg
of
you
an
adequate
supper
and
a
good
night
rest
one
thing
is
certain
said
rachel
half
to
herself
they
ca
know
who
i
am
or
they
never
would
have
taken
me
in
and
no
luggage
that
they
are
prepared
for
returned
steel
and
in
your
rooms
you
will
find
a
maid
who
is
also
prepared
and
equipped
for
your
emergency
as
to
their
not
knowing
who
you
are
at
the
hotel
there
you
are
right
they
do
not
know
it
would
have
been
inexpedient
to
tell
them
then
at
least
said
rachel
i
ought
to
know
who
i
am
supposed
to
be
and
she
smiled
for
interest
and
curiosity
were
awakened
within
her
with
the
momentary
effect
of
stimulants
but
steel
sat
silent
at
her
side
the
cab
was
tinkling
up
park
lane
the
great
park
on
the
left
the
great
houses
on
the
right
the
darkness
on
the
one
hand
the
lights
on
the
other
had
all
the
fascination
of
sharp
contrasts
that
very
fascination
which
was
steel
rachel
already
discovered
it
in
his
face
and
divined
it
in
his
character
without
admitting
to
herself
that
there
was
any
fascination
at
all
yet
otherwise
she
would
have
dropped
rather
than
have
done
what
she
was
doing
now
the
man
had
cast
a
spell
upon
her
and
for
the
present
she
did
feel
safe
in
his
hands
but
with
that
unmistakable
sense
of
immediate
security
there
mingled
a
subtler
premonition
of
ultimate
danger
to
which
rachel
had
felt
alive
from
the
first
and
this
was
the
keenest
stimulus
of
all
what
was
his
intention
and
what
his
object
to
draw
back
was
to
find
out
neither
and
to
say
the
truth
even
if
she
had
not
been
friendless
and
forlorn
rachel
would
have
been
very
sorry
to
draw
back
now
the
raw
air
in
her
face
had
greatly
revived
her
the
sights
and
lights
of
the
town
were
still
new
and
dear
to
her
she
had
come
back
to
the
world
with
a
vengeance
to
a
world
of
incident
and
interest
with
an
adventure
ready
waiting
to
take
her
out
of
her
past
self
but
it
was
only
her
companion
silence
which
enabled
rachel
to
realize
her
strange
fortune
at
this
stage
and
she
had
to
put
her
question
before
she
obtained
any
answer
at
all
if
you
insist
upon
hearing
all
the
little
details
said
steele
with
a
shrug
well
i
suppose
you
must
hear
them
but
i
hope
you
will
not
insist
i
have
had
to
make
provisions
which
you
may
very
possibly
resent
but
i
thought
it
would
be
time
enough
for
us
to
quarrel
about
them
in
the
morning
you
need
rest
and
sustenance
but
no
excitement
of
that
god
knows
you
have
had
enough
no
one
will
come
near
you
but
the
maid
of
whom
i
spoke
no
questions
will
be
put
to
you
everything
is
arranged
but
if
you
feel
equal
to
it
you
shall
hear
all
about
me
and
form
your
own
cool
judgment
of
my
behavior
towards
you
meanwhile
wo
you
trust
me
implicitly
until
then
i
do
said
rachel
and
i
will
until
then
there
are
one
or
two
things
that
i
can
promise
you
said
steel
with
the
heartiness
of
a
man
who
has
gained
his
point
you
will
not
be
compromised
in
any
sort
or
kind
of
way
your
shall
not
suffer
nothing
shall
vex
or
trouble
you
if
i
can
help
it
while
you
remain
at
this
hotel
and
this
i
guarantee
whether
you
like
it
or
not
unless
you
tell
them
not
a
single
soul
in
the
place
shall
have
the
faintest
inkling
as
to
who
you
are
now
only
keep
your
why
and
wherefore
till
he
concluded
cheerily
and
i
can
promise
you
almost
every
satisfaction
but
here
we
are
at
the
hotel
he
thrust
his
umbrella
outside
pointing
to
a
portico
and
courtyard
on
the
right
and
in
another
moment
rachel
was
receiving
the
bows
of
powdered
footmen
in
crimson
plush
while
steel
hat
in
hand
his
white
hair
gleaming
in
the
electric
light
led
the
way
to
the
lift
rachel
recollection
of
that
night
was
ever
afterwards
disjointed
and
involved
as
that
of
any
dream
but
there
were
certain
features
that
she
never
forgot
there
was
the
beautiful
suite
of
rooms
filled
with
flowers
that
must
have
cost
a
small
fortune
at
that
time
of
year
and
in
one
of
them
a
table
tastefully
laid
rachel
remembered
the
dazzle
of
silver
and
the
glare
of
napery
the
hot
plates
the
sparkling
wine
the
fruit
and
the
deep
embarrassment
of
sitting
down
to
all
this
in
solitary
state
steel
had
but
peeped
in
to
see
that
all
was
in
accordance
with
his
orders
thereafter
not
even
a
waiter
was
allowed
to
enter
but
only
rachel
attendant
to
whose
charge
she
had
been
committed
a
gentle
and
assiduous
creature
quiet
of
foot
and
quick
of
hand
who
spoke
seldom
but
in
a
soothing
voice
and
with
the
delicate
and
pretty
accent
of
the
rachel
used
to
wonder
whether
she
had
shocked
this
mannerly
young
woman
by
eating
very
ravenously
she
remembered
a
nervous
desire
to
be
done
with
that
solitary
repast
and
to
get
to
bed
yet
when
she
was
there
in
the
sweetest
and
whitest
of
fine
linen
with
a
hot
bottle
at
her
feet
and
a
fire
burning
so
brightly
in
the
room
that
the
brass
bedstead
seemed
here
and
there
then
the
sound
sleep
that
she
sorely
needed
seemed
further
off
than
ever
for
always
she
dreamt
she
was
in
prison
and
condemned
to
die
till
at
length
she
feared
to
close
her
eyes
but
nothing
had
been
forgotten
and
rachel
last
memory
of
that
eventful
day
and
not
less
eventful
night
was
of
a
mild
foreign
face
bending
over
her
with
a
and
a
gentle
word
and
the
same
good
face
and
the
same
soft
voice
were
waiting
for
her
when
she
awoke
after
many
hours
the
fire
still
burned
brightly
also
the
though
the
blind
was
up
and
the
window
filled
with
a
dull
november
sky
it
was
a
delicious
awakening
recollection
was
so
slow
to
come
rachel
might
have
been
ill
for
days
she
experienced
the
peace
that
is
left
by
illness
of
sufficient
gravity
but
all
she
ailed
was
a
slight
headache
quickly
removed
by
an
inimitable
cup
of
tea
that
fortified
her
against
the
perplexing
memories
which
now
came
swarming
to
her
mind
this
morning
however
enlightenment
was
due
and
meanwhile
rachel
received
a
hint
though
a
puzzling
one
from
the
swiss
maid
as
to
the
new
identity
which
had
been
thrust
upon
her
for
the
time
being
in
lieu
of
her
own
it
was
very
sad
for
madame
to
lose
all
her
things
cooed
the
girl
as
she
busied
herself
about
the
room
it
was
irritating
rachel
owned
beginning
to
wonder
how
much
the
other
knew
but
it
was
better
than
losing
your
life
madame
the
girl
added
with
a
smile
and
now
rachel
lay
silent
could
this
amiable
young
woman
know
all
in
one
way
rachel
rather
hoped
it
was
the
case
it
would
be
something
to
have
received
so
much
kindness
and
attention
even
though
bought
and
paid
for
from
one
of
her
own
sex
who
knew
all
there
was
to
know
and
yet
did
not
shrink
from
her
but
the
young
woman
next
words
dismissed
this
idea
when
so
many
poor
people
were
drowned
said
she
and
the
mystification
increased
presently
there
was
a
knock
at
the
outer
door
which
the
maid
answered
returning
with
steele
card
is
he
there
asked
rachel
hastily
no
madame
but
one
of
the
servants
is
waiting
for
an
answer
i
think
there
is
something
written
on
the
back
madame
rachel
read
the
harmless
request
on
the
back
of
the
card
nothing
could
have
been
better
calculated
to
turn
away
suspicion
of
one
sort
or
another
and
there
was
obvious
design
in
the
absence
of
an
envelope
but
rachel
was
not
yet
in
the
secret
and
she
was
determined
not
to
wait
an
hour
longer
than
she
need
what
is
the
time
please
i
will
see
madame
the
girl
glided
out
and
in
well
a
quarter
to
ten
madame
then
order
my
breakfast
for
a
quarter
past
and
let
steele
be
told
that
i
shall
be
delighted
to
see
him
at
eleven
chapter
vii
a
morning
call
the
way
to
conceal
one
identity
observed
steel
is
to
assume
another
as
distinctive
as
one
own
this
oracular
utterance
was
confidentially
delivered
from
the
leathern
chair
at
the
in
an
inner
recess
of
rachel
sumptuous
the
chair
had
been
wheeled
aloof
from
the
table
on
which
were
steel
hat
and
gloves
and
such
a
sheaf
of
literature
as
suggested
his
immediate
departure
upon
no
short
journey
unless
indeed
the
magazines
and
the
sunday
newspapers
turned
out
to
be
another
offering
to
minchin
like
the
nosegay
of
hothouse
flowers
which
she
still
held
in
her
hand
rachel
herself
had
inadvertently
taken
the
very
which
was
a
further
feature
of
the
recess
in
its
cushioned
depths
she
already
felt
at
a
needless
disadvantage
with
steel
bending
over
her
his
strong
face
bearing
down
as
it
were
upon
hers
and
his
black
eyes
riddling
her
with
penetrating
glances
but
to
have
risen
now
would
have
been
to
show
him
what
she
felt
so
she
trifled
with
his
flowers
without
looking
up
though
her
eyebrows
rose
a
little
on
their
own
account
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
resumed
steel
that
you
had
no
desire
to
assume
any
new
identity
or
for
a
single
moment
to
conceal
your
own
and
that
i
have
taken
a
great
deal
upon
myself
that
i
most
freely
admit
and
i
think
you
will
forgive
me
when
you
see
the
papers
is
there
so
much
about
me
then
asked
rachel
with
a
sigh
of
apprehension
a
leading
article
in
every
one
of
them
but
they
will
keep
indeed
i
would
much
rather
you
never
saw
them
at
all
was
that
why
you
brought
them
in
mr
steel
the
question
was
irresistible
its
satire
unconcealed
but
disregard
of
it
steered
admirably
clear
of
contempt
that
was
why
i
bought
them
certainly
he
admitted
but
i
brought
them
with
me
for
quite
a
different
purpose
for
which
one
would
indeed
have
been
enough
i
was
saying
however
that
the
best
way
to
sink
identity
is
to
assume
another
provided
that
the
second
be
as
distinctive
as
the
first
we
will
leave
for
a
moment
the
question
of
my
officiousness
in
the
matter
and
we
suppose
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
i
was
authorized
by
you
to
do
what
in
fact
i
have
done
all
last
week
the
papers
were
literally
full
of
your
trial
but
on
saturday
there
was
a
second
sensation
as
well
and
this
morning
it
is
hard
to
say
which
is
first
and
which
second
they
both
occupy
so
many
columns
you
may
not
know
it
but
the
cape
liner
due
on
saturday
was
lost
with
scores
of
lives
off
finisterre
on
friday
morning
last
rachel
failed
to
see
the
connection
and
yet
she
felt
vaguely
that
there
was
one
if
she
could
but
recall
it
meanwhile
she
said
nothing
but
listened
with
as
much
attention
as
a
mental
search
would
permit
i
heard
of
it
first
continued
steel
late
on
friday
afternoon
as
i
came
away
from
the
old
bailey
now
it
was
on
friday
afternoon
if
you
recollect
that
you
gave
evidence
yourself
in
your
own
defence
when
you
left
the
minchin
and
even
before
you
left
it
i
knew
that
you
were
saved
rachel
remembered
the
swiss
maid
remark
about
the
loss
of
her
clothes
and
the
number
of
persons
who
had
fared
so
much
worse
and
lost
their
lives
but
steel
last
words
dismissed
every
thought
but
that
of
their
own
import
and
in
an
instant
she
was
trembling
upright
in
the
you
believed
me
she
whispered
you
believed
me
at
the
time
and
for
nothing
had
he
earned
such
gratitude
yet
her
moist
eyes
saw
the
courtesy
of
his
bow
in
answer
but
not
the
subtlety
of
the
smile
that
bore
it
company
in
the
depths
of
the
dark
eyes
it
was
a
smile
that
did
not
extend
to
the
short
tight
mouth
what
is
more
to
the
point
my
dear
lady
he
went
on
in
words
the
jury
believed
you
and
i
saw
that
they
did
you
made
a
tremendous
impression
upon
them
the
lawyer
against
you
was
too
humane
to
try
very
hard
to
remove
it
and
the
judge
too
just
though
your
own
man
did
his
best
but
i
saw
at
once
that
it
would
never
be
removed
it
was
between
you
and
the
jury
human
being
to
human
beings
and
no
third
legal
party
intervening
that
was
where
you
scored
you
went
straight
as
a
die
to
those
twelve
simple
hearts
and
i
saw
what
you
had
done
what
the
lawyers
between
them
could
not
undo
and
took
immediate
measures
rachel
looked
up
with
parted
lips
only
to
shut
them
firmly
without
a
word
and
who
was
i
to
take
measures
on
your
behalf
queried
steel
putting
the
question
for
her
what
right
or
excuse
had
i
to
mix
myself
up
in
your
affairs
i
will
tell
you
for
this
morning
is
not
last
night
and
at
least
you
have
one
good
night
rest
between
you
and
the
past
my
dear
minchin
i
had
absolutely
no
right
at
all
but
i
had
the
excuse
which
every
man
has
who
sees
a
woman
left
to
stand
alone
against
the
world
and
who
thrusts
himself
no
matter
how
officiously
into
the
breach
beside
her
and
then
for
a
week
i
had
seen
you
all
day
and
every
day
upon
your
trial
at
last
there
something
with
a
ring
of
definite
insincerity
something
that
rachel
could
take
up
and
she
gazed
upon
her
champion
with
candid
eyes
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
never
saw
me
before
my
trouble
mr
steel
never
in
my
life
my
dear
lady
then
you
knew
something
about
me
or
mine
what
one
read
in
the
newspapers
neither
more
nor
less
upon
my
most
solemn
word
if
that
will
satisfy
you
and
it
did
for
if
there
had
been
palpable
insincerity
in
his
previous
protestations
there
was
sincerity
of
a
still
more
obvious
order
in
steel
downright
assurances
on
these
two
points
he
had
never
ever
seen
her
before
he
knew
nothing
whatever
about
her
up
to
the
period
of
notoriety
he
had
no
special
and
no
previous
knowledge
of
his
own
it
might
not
be
true
of
course
but
there
was
that
in
the
eyes
which
convinced
rachel
once
and
for
all
there
was
a
sudden
light
in
them
a
light
as
candid
as
that
which
happened
to
be
shining
in
her
own
but
a
not
too
kindly
one
rather
a
glint
of
genuine
resentment
it
was
his
smooth
protestations
that
rachel
distrusted
and
disliked
if
she
could
ruffle
him
she
might
get
at
the
real
man
and
with
her
questions
she
appeared
to
have
done
so
already
i
am
more
than
satisfied
in
one
way
replied
rachel
and
less
in
another
i
rather
wish
you
had
known
something
about
me
it
would
have
made
it
more
natural
for
you
to
come
to
my
assistance
but
never
mind
what
were
these
immediate
measures
i
took
these
rooms
i
had
spoken
of
taking
them
earlier
in
the
week
for
me
yes
on
the
chance
of
your
getting
off
but
you
did
not
say
they
were
for
me
no
and
i
was
vague
in
what
i
had
said
until
then
i
had
a
daughter
a
widow
whom
i
rather
expected
to
arrive
from
abroad
towards
the
end
of
the
week
but
i
was
quite
vague
because
you
thought
i
had
no
chance
i
had
not
heard
your
evidence
the
very
afternoon
i
did
hear
it
and
had
no
longer
any
doubt
about
the
issue
in
my
own
mind
i
also
heard
of
this
wreck
the
very
thing
i
waited
till
next
morning
for
the
list
of
the
saved
luckily
there
were
plenty
of
them
and
i
picked
out
the
name
of
a
married
woman
travelling
alone
and
therefore
very
possibly
a
widow
from
the
number
then
i
went
to
the
manager
the
daughter
whom
i
expected
had
been
wrecked
but
she
was
saved
and
would
arrive
that
night
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
survivors
were
picked
up
by
a
passing
north
german
lloyd
and
they
did
reach
london
on
saturday
night
meanwhile
i
had
impressed
it
upon
the
manager
to
keep
the
matter
as
quiet
as
possible
for
many
excellent
reasons
which
i
need
not
go
into
now
but
the
reason
for
so
elaborate
a
pretence
and
the
keen
dark
face
was
searched
with
a
scrutiny
worthy
of
itself
steel
set
his
mouth
in
another
visible
resolution
to
tell
the
truth
i
thought
you
might
not
be
sorry
to
cease
being
minchin
the
minchin
who
had
become
so
cruelly
notorious
through
no
fault
of
her
own
if
only
for
a
day
or
two
or
a
single
night
that
was
most
easily
to
be
effected
by
your
arriving
here
minus
possessions
and
plus
a
very
definite
story
of
your
own
you
made
very
sure
of
me
said
rachel
dryly
i
trusted
to
my
own
powers
of
persuasion
and
it
was
said
you
had
no
friends
i
will
confess
added
steel
that
i
hoped
the
report
was
true
did
it
follow
that
i
could
have
no
pride
by
no
means
on
the
contrary
i
knew
that
you
were
full
of
pride
it
is
if
i
may
venture
to
say
so
one
of
your
most
salient
characteristics
nothing
was
more
noticeable
at
your
trial
nothing
finer
have
i
ever
seen
but
added
steel
suppressing
a
burst
of
enthusiasm
that
gained
by
the
suppression
but
madam
i
hoped
and
prayed
that
you
would
have
the
sense
to
put
your
pride
in
the
second
place
for
once
well
said
rachel
and
so
far
i
have
done
so
heaven
knows
and
that
is
something
rejoined
steel
impressively
even
if
it
ends
at
this
even
if
you
wo
hear
me
out
it
is
something
that
you
have
had
one
night
and
one
morning
free
from
insult
discomfort
and
annoyance
rachel
felt
half
frightened
and
half
indignant
steel
was
standing
up
looking
very
earnestly
down
upon
her
and
something
that
she
had
dimly
divined
in
the
very
beginning
only
to
chide
herself
for
the
mere
thought
that
thing
was
in
his
face
and
in
his
voice
rachel
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
change
the
subject
but
as
will
be
seen
an
unlucky
one
so
i
am
supposed
to
be
your
daughter
she
exclaimed
nervously
may
i
ask
my
new
name
if
you
like
but
i
am
going
to
suggest
to
you
a
still
newer
name
mrs
minchin
rachel
tried
to
laugh
though
his
quietly
determined
and
serious
face
made
it
more
than
difficult
do
you
mean
that
i
am
not
to
be
your
daughter
any
longer
mr
steel
not
if
i
can
help
it
but
it
will
depend
upon
yourself
and
what
do
you
want
to
make
me
now
my
wife
chapter
viii
the
dove
and
the
serpent
rachel
was
bereft
of
speech
and
yet
a
certain
sense
of
relief
underlay
the
natural
embarrassment
caused
by
a
proposal
so
premature
and
so
abrupt
nor
was
the
deeper
emotion
very
difficult
to
analyze
here
at
last
was
a
logical
explanation
of
the
whole
behavior
of
this
man
it
was
the
first
that
had
occurred
to
her
and
after
all
it
was
the
only
possible
one
i
want
you
to
be
my
wife
repeated
steel
with
enough
of
respect
in
his
tone
yet
none
the
less
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
accustomed
to
obtain
what
he
wants
and
rachel
looking
at
the
wiry
upright
figure
and
at
the
fresh
elderly
but
virile
face
with
its
sombre
eyes
and
its
snowy
hair
thought
once
again
of
the
ancient
saw
which
she
had
quoted
to
herself
the
night
before
only
to
dismiss
it
finally
from
her
mind
this
man
was
no
fool
nor
was
he
old
he
might
be
eccentric
but
he
was
eminently
sane
he
might
be
elderly
in
the
arbitrary
matter
of
mere
years
but
an
old
man
he
was
not
and
never
would
be
with
those
eyes
she
tried
to
tell
him
it
was
absurd
but
before
the
word
could
come
she
saw
that
it
was
the
last
one
to
apply
he
was
so
confident
so
quiet
so
sure
of
himself
if
not
of
rachel
at
last
she
told
him
she
could
not
think
of
it
he
had
seen
nothing
of
her
and
could
not
possibly
care
for
her
even
supposing
that
she
cared
for
him
by
said
he
do
you
mean
being
love
as
they
say
and
all
that
naturally
said
rachel
with
great
ease
and
irony
but
with
a
new
misgiving
every
moment
and
have
i
said
i
was
in
love
with
you
inquired
steel
with
a
smile
as
indulgent
as
his
tone
it
might
perhaps
be
no
more
than
the
truth
but
have
i
had
the
insolence
to
tell
you
so
it
is
a
greater
insult
if
you
are
not
returned
rachel
speaking
hotly
and
quickly
but
with
lowered
eyes
what
to
offer
to
marry
a
person
whom
one
does
not
as
yet
pretend
to
love
rachel
vouchsafed
no
reply
whom
one
only
but
tremendously
admires
rachel
felt
bound
to
answer
him
for
at
least
there
was
no
insult
in
his
tone
she
raised
her
candid
eyes
a
sweet
brown
blush
upon
her
face
yes
she
said
i
think
there
is
absolutely
no
excuse
for
a
proposal
of
marriage
if
it
is
not
founded
upon
love
and
nothing
else
or
its
pretence
and
nothing
else
amended
steel
with
a
bow
and
a
smile
of
some
severity
that
is
a
hard
saying
he
went
on
resuming
his
chair
and
wheeling
it
even
nearer
to
rachel
than
it
had
been
before
moreover
he
added
since
i
have
already
insulted
you
let
me
tell
you
that
it
is
an
exceedingly
commonplace
saying
into
the
bargain
it
depends
you
must
admit
upon
the
commonplace
conception
of
marriage
and
before
we
go
any
further
i
should
like
to
give
you
my
own
conception
not
of
the
institution
but
of
the
particular
marriage
which
i
have
in
view
so
he
had
it
in
view
it
was
not
an
inspiration
but
already
quite
a
prospect
rachel
made
an
acid
little
note
of
this
but
there
was
no
acidity
in
her
permission
to
him
to
proceed
her
turn
was
coming
last
the
marriage
that
i
propose
to
you
continued
steel
is
simply
the
most
convenient
form
of
friendship
of
which
i
can
think
i
want
to
be
your
friend
indeed
that
much
i
mean
to
be
if
necessary
in
spite
of
you
i
was
interested
in
your
case
so
i
came
up
to
hear
your
trial
i
was
more
interested
in
your
trial
but
most
interested
of
all
in
yourself
there
indeed
the
word
is
too
weak
but
i
will
not
vex
your
spirit
with
a
stronger
my
attraction
you
know
my
determination
you
know
even
the
low
wiles
to
which
your
pride
reduced
me
even
my
dodging
and
dogging
have
been
quite
openly
admitted
to
you
on
the
first
reasonable
opportunity
all
this
business
of
the
shipwrecked
daughter
was
of
course
a
crude
device
enough
but
i
had
very
little
time
to
think
and
my
first
care
was
that
you
should
not
be
recognized
here
or
elsewhere
in
my
society
that
was
essential
if
there
was
the
slightest
chance
of
your
even
listening
to
my
proposition
as
indeed
you
are
doing
now
last
night
i
told
you
nothing
because
that
always
easier
than
telling
only
a
little
moreover
you
were
so
distraught
that
you
would
possibly
have
gone
right
away
without
benefiting
even
to
the
slight
extent
of
the
comfortable
night
rest
you
so
badly
needed
but
this
morning
i
am
prepared
to
put
it
to
the
touch
and
let
me
begin
by
saying
that
if
circumstances
would
permit
me
to
continue
the
paternal
imposture
that
would
be
quite
enough
for
me
unluckily
i
am
known
in
my
own
country
as
an
old
bachelor
so
that
i
can
not
suddenly
produce
a
widowed
daughter
without
considerable
unpleasantness
for
us
both
what
i
can
do
however
and
steel
bent
further
forward
with
eyes
that
held
rachel
in
their
spell
what
i
can
do
and
will
is
to
go
back
with
a
lady
who
shall
be
my
wife
in
name
my
daughter
in
effect
we
should
i
trust
be
the
best
of
friends
but
i
will
give
you
my
word
and
not
only
my
word
but
my
bond
that
we
never
need
be
anything
more
he
had
spoken
rapidly
the
pause
that
followed
lasted
longer
than
this
lengthy
speech
and
through
it
all
they
sat
with
eyes
still
locked
until
he
spoke
again
you
believe
at
least
in
the
bona
fides
of
my
offer
and
rachel
still
looking
in
his
eyes
murmured
that
she
did
you
will
bear
in
mind
how
essentially
it
differs
from
the
ordinary
offer
of
the
kind
also
that
i
have
never
for
a
moment
pretended
to
be
in
love
with
you
i
will
steel
had
risen
as
if
to
go
the
keen
scrutiny
was
withdrawn
a
distinct
spell
as
distinctly
broken
and
yet
he
lingered
with
a
smile
that
said
he
was
a
poor
compliment
to
pay
twice
over
but
it
is
human
to
err
and
in
my
anxiety
not
to
do
so
on
the
side
of
sentiment
i
own
myself
in
danger
of
flying
to
the
other
extreme
well
you
know
which
is
the
common
extreme
in
such
cases
and
at
all
events
we
shall
avoid
the
usual
pitfall
i
am
going
to
give
you
a
few
minutes
to
think
it
over
then
if
you
care
to
go
into
it
further
i
shall
be
most
happy
if
not
the
matter
is
at
an
end
a
few
minutes
rachel
felt
very
angry
without
knowing
that
she
was
most
angry
with
herself
for
not
feeling
angrier
still
she
had
heard
quite
enough
it
were
weakness
to
listen
to
another
word
and
yet
and
yet
do
go
said
rachel
with
some
petulance
that
is
quite
unnecessary
anything
more
extraordinary
but
i
owe
you
too
much
already
to
be
your
critic
still
i
do
think
i
am
entitled
to
go
a
little
further
into
the
matter
as
you
said
without
committing
myself
to
be
sure
you
are
but
this
time
he
remained
standing
and
for
once
he
kept
those
mesmeric
eyes
to
himself
obviously
rachel
was
to
have
a
chance
you
spoke
of
your
own
country
she
began
do
you
live
abroad
there
was
the
least
suspicion
of
eagerness
in
the
question
rachel
herself
was
unaware
of
it
not
so
steel
and
he
sighed
a
mere
figure
he
said
what
i
meant
was
my
own
and
where
is
that
in
the
north
he
replied
vaguely
did
you
look
twice
at
my
card
well
here
is
another
if
you
will
do
me
that
honor
now
the
initials
j
stand
for
no
very
interesting
names
john
buchanan
a
certain
interest
in
the
buchanan
perhaps
it
comes
out
in
the
flesh
i
fancy
though
not
on
the
tongue
as
for
the
address
normanthorpe
house
is
the
rather
historic
old
seat
of
the
family
of
that
name
but
they
have
so
many
vastly
superior
and
more
modern
places
and
the
last
fifty
years
have
so
ruined
the
surroundings
that
i
was
able
to
induce
the
duke
to
take
a
price
for
it
a
year
or
two
ago
he
had
hardly
slept
a
night
there
in
his
life
and
i
got
it
for
a
song
the
northborough
which
you
will
observe
it
is
a
good
four
miles
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
the
centre
of
the
delverton
but
you
may
very
well
have
spent
a
year
in
this
country
without
having
heard
of
it
they
would
be
shocked
at
northborough
but
nowhere
else
rachel
had
dropped
the
card
into
her
lap
she
was
looking
straight
at
john
buchanan
steel
himself
you
are
very
rich
she
said
gravely
i
am
nothing
of
the
kind
he
protested
the
duke
is
rich
if
you
like
but
i
had
to
scrape
together
to
pay
him
what
would
replenish
his
or
stand
him
in
a
new
yacht
but
rachel
was
not
deceived
i
might
have
known
you
were
very
rich
she
murmured
as
much
to
herself
as
to
him
and
there
was
a
strange
finality
in
her
tone
as
though
all
was
over
between
them
a
still
more
strange
regret
involuntary
unconscious
and
yet
distinct
granting
your
hypothesis
for
the
sake
of
argument
he
went
on
with
his
simplest
smile
is
it
as
difficult
as
ever
for
the
poor
rich
man
to
get
to
heaven
rachel
spent
some
moments
in
serious
thought
he
was
wonderfully
honest
with
her
of
his
central
motive
alone
was
she
uncertain
unconvinced
in
all
else
she
felt
instinctively
that
he
was
telling
her
the
truth
telling
her
even
more
than
he
need
his
generous
candor
was
a
challenge
to
her
own
it
may
be
very
small
of
me
she
said
at
length
but
somehow
if
you
had
been
comparatively
poor
i
should
have
been
less
ashamed
and
candor
begot
candor
as
it
generally
will
upon
my
word
he
cried
you
make
me
sigh
for
the
suburbs
and
six
hundred
a
year
but
you
shall
know
the
worst
i
meant
you
to
know
it
when
i
came
in
then
i
changed
my
mind
but
in
for
a
penny
in
for
the
lot
he
caught
up
the
magazine
which
he
had
brought
in
with
the
sheaf
of
newspapers
and
he
handed
it
to
rachel
open
at
an
article
quite
excellently
illustrated
for
an
english
magazine
there
he
cried
there
a
long
screed
about
the
wretched
place
before
it
came
into
my
hands
but
it
no
use
pretending
it
is
quite
the
place
it
was
i
took
over
the
whole
thing
every
stick
outside
and
in
and
i
put
in
new
drainage
and
the
electric
light
his
tone
of
regret
was
intentionally
ludicrous
had
rachel
been
listening
she
would
once
more
have
suspected
a
pose
but
already
she
was
deep
in
the
article
in
the
magazine
or
rather
in
its
not
inartistic
illustrations
the
house
from
the
tennis
lawn
in
the
kitchen
garden
the
door
a
a
corner
of
the
chinese
room
a
portion
of
the
grand
staircase
of
such
were
the
titles
underneath
the
process
pictures
and
in
all
but
their
production
each
of
these
was
more
beautiful
than
the
last
that
observed
steel
happens
to
be
the
very
article
from
which
i
first
got
wind
of
the
place
when
i
was
looking
about
for
one
and
now
he
added
i
suppose
i
have
cut
my
own
throat
like
the
devil
i
have
taken
you
up
to
a
high
place
it
was
no
word
from
rachel
that
cut
him
short
but
his
own
taste
with
which
she
at
least
had
very
little
fault
to
find
and
rachel
was
critical
enough
but
her
experience
was
still
unripe
and
she
liked
his
view
of
his
possessions
without
perceiving
how
it
disarmed
her
own
presently
she
looked
up
now
i
see
how
much
i
should
have
to
gain
but
what
would
you
gain
the
question
was
no
sooner
asked
than
rachel
foresaw
the
pretty
speech
which
was
its
obvious
answer
steel
however
refrained
from
making
it
i
am
an
oldish
man
he
said
and
yes
there
is
no
use
in
denying
that
i
am
comfortably
off
i
want
a
wife
or
rather
my
neighbors
seem
bent
upon
finding
me
one
and
if
the
worst
has
to
come
to
the
worst
i
prefer
to
choose
for
myself
matrimony
however
is
about
the
very
last
state
of
life
that
i
desire
and
i
take
it
to
be
the
same
with
you
therefore
to
put
the
cart
before
the
horse
you
would
suit
me
ideally
one
own
life
would
be
unaltered
but
the
delverton
mothers
would
cease
from
troubling
and
at
the
head
of
my
establishment
there
would
be
a
lady
of
whom
i
should
be
most
justly
proud
and
even
in
my
own
life
i
should
i
hope
be
the
more
than
occasional
gainer
by
her
society
may
i
also
add
by
her
sympathy
by
her
advice
minchin
cried
steel
with
sudden
feeling
the
conditions
shall
be
very
rigid
my
lawyer
shall
see
to
that
nor
shall
i
allow
myself
a
loophole
for
any
weakness
or
nonsense
whatsoever
in
the
future
old
fellows
like
myself
have
made
fools
of
themselves
before
but
you
shall
be
safeguarded
from
the
beginning
let
there
be
no
talk
or
thought
of
love
between
us
from
first
to
last
but
as
for
admiration
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
i
admire
you
as
i
never
admired
any
woman
in
the
world
before
and
i
hope
in
spite
of
that
we
shall
be
friends
still
the
indicative
mood
still
not
for
a
moment
the
conditional
rachel
did
not
fail
to
make
another
note
but
now
there
was
nothing
bitter
even
in
her
thoughts
she
believed
in
this
man
and
in
his
promises
moreover
she
began
to
focus
the
one
thing
about
him
in
which
she
disbelieved
it
was
his
feeling
towards
her
nothing
more
and
nothing
else
there
he
was
insincere
but
it
was
a
pardonable
insincerity
after
all
of
his
admiration
she
was
convinced
it
had
been
open
and
honest
all
along
but
there
was
something
deeper
than
admiration
he
could
say
what
he
liked
the
woman
knew
and
what
could
it
be
but
love
the
woman
knew
and
though
the
tragedy
of
her
life
was
so
close
behind
her
nay
though
mystery
and
suspicion
encompassed
her
still
as
they
might
until
her
death
the
woman
thrilled
it
was
a
thrill
of
excitement
chiefly
but
excitement
was
not
the
only
element
there
was
the
personal
factor
too
there
was
the
fascination
which
this
man
had
for
her
which
he
could
exert
at
will
and
which
he
was
undoubtedly
exerting
now
to
escape
from
his
eyes
to
think
but
once
more
for
herself
and
by
herself
rachel
rose
at
last
and
looked
from
the
window
which
lit
this
recess
it
was
the
usual
november
day
in
london
no
sun
a
mist
but
not
a
fog
cabmen
in
capes
horses
sliding
on
the
muddy
street
women
picking
their
way
home
from
church
shabby
women
hurrying
in
shawls
hurrying
as
rachel
herself
had
done
the
night
before
as
she
might
again
and
whither
and
whither
in
all
the
world
rachel
turned
from
the
window
with
a
shudder
she
caught
up
the
first
newspaper
of
the
sheaf
upon
the
steel
had
moved
into
the
body
of
the
room
she
could
not
even
see
him
through
the
alcove
so
much
the
better
she
would
discover
for
herself
what
they
said
leading
articles
are
easily
found
and
in
a
sunday
paper
they
are
seldom
long
rachel
was
soon
through
the
first
her
blood
boiling
the
second
she
could
not
finish
for
her
tears
the
third
dried
her
eyes
with
the
fires
of
fierce
resentment
it
was
not
so
much
what
they
said
it
was
what
they
were
obviously
afraid
to
say
it
was
their
circumlocution
their
innuendo
their
mild
surprise
their
perfunctory
congratulations
their
assumption
of
chivalry
and
their
lack
of
its
essence
that
wounded
and
stung
the
subject
of
these
effusions
as
she
raised
her
flushed
face
from
the
last
of
them
steel
stood
before
her
once
more
the
incarnation
of
all
grave
sympathy
and
consideration
you
must
not
think
said
he
that
my
proposal
admits
of
no
alternative
but
the
miserable
one
of
making
your
own
way
in
a
suspicious
and
uncharitable
world
on
the
contrary
if
i
am
not
to
be
your
nominal
and
legal
husband
i
still
intend
to
be
your
actual
friend
on
the
first
point
you
are
to
be
consulted
but
on
the
second
not
even
you
shall
stand
in
my
way
nor
in
that
event
would
i
attempt
to
rob
you
of
the
independence
which
you
value
so
highly
on
the
other
hand
i
would
point
the
way
to
an
independence
worth
having
i
am
glad
you
have
seen
those
papers
though
they
may
be
worse
well
you
may
be
shocked
but
if
you
wo
have
me
the
worse
the
better
say
i
your
case
was
most
iniquitously
commented
upon
before
ever
it
came
for
trial
there
is
sure
to
be
a
fresh
crop
of
iniquities
now
but
i
shall
be
much
mistaken
if
you
can
not
mulct
the
more
flagrant
offenders
in
heavy
damages
for
libel
rachel
shivered
at
the
thought
she
was
done
with
her
case
for
ever
and
for
ever
people
could
think
her
guilty
if
they
liked
but
that
the
case
should
breed
other
cases
and
thus
drag
on
and
on
and
above
all
that
she
should
make
money
out
of
all
that
past
horror
what
an
unbearable
idea
on
second
thoughts
steel
agreed
then
you
must
let
me
send
you
back
to
australia
no
no
no
she
could
never
show
her
face
there
again
or
anywhere
else
where
she
was
known
she
must
begin
life
afresh
that
was
evident
it
was
evident
to
me
said
steel
quietly
though
not
more
so
than
the
injustice
of
it
from
the
very
beginning
hence
the
plans
and
proposals
that
i
have
put
before
you
rachel
regarded
him
wildly
the
sunday
papers
had
driven
her
to
desperation
as
perhaps
it
was
intended
that
they
should
are
you
sure
she
cried
that
they
would
not
know
me
up
north
not
from
eve
he
answered
airily
i
should
see
to
that
and
besides
we
should
first
travel
say
until
the
summer
if
only
i
begin
my
life
again
said
rachel
to
herself
but
aloud
in
a
way
that
made
no
secret
of
her
last
most
desperate
inclination
that
is
exactly
what
i
wish
you
to
do
steel
rejoined
quietly
even
gently
his
hand
lying
lightly
but
kindly
upon
her
quivering
shoulder
how
strong
his
touch
how
firm
how
reassuring
it
was
her
first
contact
with
his
hand
i
wish
it
so
much
he
went
on
that
i
would
have
your
past
life
utterly
buried
even
between
ourselves
nay
if
it
were
possible
even
in
your
own
mind
also
i
for
my
part
would
undertake
never
to
ask
you
one
solitary
question
about
that
life
on
one
small
and
only
fair
condition
supposing
we
make
a
compact
now
anything
to
bury
my
own
past
owned
rachel
yes
i
would
do
anything
anything
then
you
must
help
me
to
bury
mine
too
he
said
i
was
never
married
but
a
past
i
have
i
would
do
my
best
said
rachel
if
i
married
you
you
will
do
your
best
added
steel
correcting
her
and
there
is
my
compact
cut
and
dried
i
ask
you
nothing
you
ask
me
nothing
and
there
is
to
be
no
question
of
love
between
us
first
or
last
but
we
help
each
other
to
forget
from
this
day
forth
rachel
could
not
speak
his
eyes
were
upon
her
black
inscrutable
arrestive
of
her
very
faculties
to
say
nothing
of
her
will
she
could
only
answer
him
when
he
had
turned
away
and
was
moving
towards
the
door
where
are
you
going
she
cried
to
send
to
my
solicitor
replied
steel
as
i
warned
him
that
i
might
it
has
all
to
be
drawn
up
and
there
is
the
question
of
a
settlement
and
other
questions
perhaps
which
you
may
like
to
put
to
him
yourself
without
delay
chapter
ix
a
change
of
scene
the
reverend
hugh
woodgate
vicar
of
a
benefice
for
generations
in
the
gift
of
the
dukes
of
normanthorpe
but
latterly
in
that
of
one
john
buchanan
steel
was
writing
his
sermon
on
a
friday
afternoon
just
six
months
after
the
foregoing
events
the
month
was
therefore
may
and
at
either
end
of
the
long
low
room
in
which
woodgate
sat
at
work
the
windows
were
filled
with
a
flutter
of
summer
curtains
against
a
brilliant
background
of
waving
greenery
but
a
fire
burned
in
one
of
the
two
fireplaces
in
the
funnel
of
a
room
for
a
treacherous
east
wind
skimmed
the
sunlit
earth
outside
and
whistled
and
sang
through
one
window
as
the
birds
did
through
the
other
woodgate
was
a
tall
man
with
a
blot
of
whisker
under
each
ear
and
the
cleanest
of
clerical
collars
encompassing
his
throat
it
was
a
kindly
face
that
pored
over
the
unpretentious
periods
as
they
grew
by
degrees
upon
the
paper
in
the
peculiar
but
not
uncommon
hand
which
is
the
of
a
certain
sort
of
education
upon
a
certain
order
of
mind
the
present
specimen
was
perhaps
more
methodical
than
most
therein
it
was
characteristic
of
the
man
from
may
to
september
woodgate
never
failed
to
finish
his
sermon
on
the
friday
that
on
the
saturday
he
might
be
free
to
play
cricket
with
his
men
and
lads
he
was
a
poor
preacher
and
no
cricketer
at
all
but
in
both
branches
he
did
his
best
with
the
simple
zeal
and
the
unconscious
sincerity
which
redeemed
not
a
few
of
his
deficiencies
so
intent
was
the
vicar
upon
his
task
so
engrossed
in
the
expression
of
that
which
had
already
been
expressed
many
a
million
times
that
he
did
not
hear
wheels
in
his
drive
on
the
side
where
the
wind
sang
loudest
he
heard
nothing
until
the
door
opened
and
a
girl
in
her
twenties
trim
slim
and
brown
with
health
came
hurriedly
in
i
sorry
to
disturb
you
dear
but
who
do
you
think
is
here
hugh
woodgate
turned
round
in
his
chair
and
his
honest
filled
with
open
admiration
of
the
wife
who
was
so
many
years
younger
than
himself
and
who
had
seen
in
him
heaven
knew
what
he
never
could
look
at
her
without
that
look
first
and
only
now
after
some
years
of
marriage
was
he
beginning
sometimes
to
do
so
without
this
thought
next
but
he
had
not
the
gift
of
expression
even
in
the
perpetual
matter
of
his
devotion
and
perhaps
its
perpetuity
owed
something
to
that
very
want
at
least
there
was
none
of
the
verbal
evaporation
which
comes
of
too
much
lovers
talk
who
is
it
he
asked
mrs
venables
woodgate
groaned
was
he
obliged
to
appear
his
jaw
fell
and
his
eyes
sparkled
dear
i
would
even
have
let
you
know
she
was
here
you
have
been
interrupted
for
a
single
instant
if
venables
clamoring
to
see
you
and
really
i
begin
to
clamor
too
for
she
is
full
of
some
mysterious
news
which
she
wo
tell
me
till
you
are
there
to
hear
it
also
be
an
angel
for
five
minutes
woodgate
wiped
his
pen
in
his
deliberate
way
probably
one
of
the
girls
is
engaged
said
he
if
so
i
hope
sybil
no
sybil
is
here
too
she
does
look
a
bit
engaged
but
rather
bored
as
though
she
had
heard
the
story
several
times
already
whatever
it
may
be
they
have
certainly
paid
several
calls
now
you
look
quite
nice
so
in
you
come
venables
a
stout
but
comely
lady
with
a
bright
brown
eye
and
a
face
full
of
character
and
ability
opened
fire
upon
the
vicar
as
soon
as
they
had
shaken
hands
while
her
daughter
looked
wistfully
at
the
nearest
books
he
is
married
cried
venables
beginning
in
the
middle
like
a
modern
novelist
indeed
returned
the
clergyman
with
equal
directness
and
who
is
he
your
neighbor
and
your
patron
mr
steel
married
repeated
woodgate
with
tremendous
emphasis
mr
steel
this
is
news
declared
her
husband
as
though
he
had
expected
none
worthy
of
the
name
and
they
both
demanded
further
particulars
at
which
venables
shook
her
expensive
bonnet
with
great
relish
do
you
know
steel
so
well
so
much
better
than
we
do
and
can
you
ask
for
particulars
about
anything
he
ever
does
his
marriage
continued
venables
like
everything
else
about
him
is
in
mystery
as
one
of
those
vulgar
creatures
says
in
dickens
but
i
really
forget
which
it
was
never
announced
in
the
for
that
i
can
vouch
myself
was
ever
anything
more
like
him
or
less
like
anybody
else
to
disappear
for
six
months
and
then
turn
up
with
a
wife
but
has
he
turned
up
cried
the
vicar
young
wife
forgetting
for
a
moment
a
certain
preoccupation
caused
by
the
arrival
of
the
and
by
a
rapid
resignation
to
the
thickness
of
the
bread
and
butter
and
the
distressing
absence
of
such
hot
things
as
would
have
been
in
readiness
if
venables
had
been
expected
for
a
single
moment
it
showed
the
youth
of
morna
woodgate
that
she
should
harbor
a
wish
to
compete
with
the
wealthiest
woman
in
the
neighborhood
even
in
the
matter
of
afternoon
tea
and
her
breeding
that
no
such
thought
was
legible
in
her
face
i
have
heard
nothing
about
it
said
the
vicar
in
a
tone
indicative
of
much
honest
doubt
in
the
matter
nor
is
it
the
case
to
my
knowledge
rejoined
venables
but
from
all
we
hear
it
may
become
the
case
any
moment
they
were
married
in
italy
last
autumn
so
he
says
and
are
on
their
way
home
at
this
minute
if
he
says
so
observed
the
vicar
with
mild
humor
it
is
probably
true
he
ought
to
know
and
who
was
she
his
young
wife
asked
with
immense
interest
the
cups
having
gone
round
and
the
bread
and
butter
been
accepted
in
spite
of
its
proportions
my
dear
woodgate
said
venables
cordially
you
may
well
ask
who
was
she
indeed
it
was
the
first
question
i
asked
my
own
informant
who
by
the
way
was
your
friend
langholm
but
he
knew
no
more
than
the
man
in
the
moon
and
who
told
langholm
of
all
people
pursued
morna
woodgate
it
is
not
often
that
we
get
news
of
the
real
world
from
him
birds
of
a
feather
remarked
her
caller
it
was
steel
himself
who
wrote
to
your
other
eccentric
friend
and
told
him
neither
more
nor
less
than
i
have
told
you
he
was
married
in
italy
last
autumn
not
even
the
town
not
even
the
month
let
alone
the
lady
name
if
indeed
and
venables
concluded
with
a
sufficiently
eloquent
hiatus
i
imagine
she
is
a
lady
said
the
vicar
to
his
tea
you
are
so
charitable
dear
mr
woodgate
i
hope
i
am
he
said
simply
in
this
case
i
see
no
reason
to
be
anything
else
what
when
you
know
really
nothing
about
steel
himself
and
the
bright
brown
eyes
of
venables
grew
smaller
and
harder
as
they
pinned
hugh
woodgate
to
his
chair
i
beg
your
pardon
said
that
downright
person
i
know
a
great
deal
about
steel
he
has
done
an
immense
amount
for
the
parish
there
are
our
new
schoolrooms
to
speak
for
themselves
there
are
very
few
who
would
do
the
half
of
what
steel
has
done
for
us
during
the
short
time
he
has
been
at
normanthorpe
that
may
be
said
the
lady
with
the
ample
smile
of
conscious
condescension
for
he
has
certainly
not
omitted
to
let
his
light
shine
before
men
but
that
is
not
telling
us
who
or
what
he
was
before
he
came
here
or
how
he
made
his
money
then
hugh
woodgate
gave
the
half
boyish
half
bashful
laugh
with
which
he
was
wont
to
preface
his
most
candid
sayings
and
i
do
think
it
any
business
of
ours
he
said
morna
went
a
trifle
browner
than
she
naturally
was
her
husband
said
so
little
that
what
he
did
say
was
often
almost
painfully
to
the
point
and
now
venables
had
turned
from
him
to
her
with
a
smile
which
the
young
wife
disliked
for
it
called
attention
to
the
vicar
discourtesy
while
it
appealed
to
herself
for
prettier
manners
and
better
sense
it
was
a
moment
requiring
some
little
tact
but
woodgate
was
just
equal
to
it
hugh
how
rude
of
you
she
exclaimed
with
only
the
suspicion
of
a
smile
you
forget
that
it
your
duty
to
be
friendly
with
everybody
there
no
such
obligation
on
anybody
else
i
should
be
friendly
with
steel
said
hugh
duty
or
no
duty
after
what
he
has
done
for
the
parish
and
his
pleasant
honest
face
and
smile
did
away
with
the
necessity
for
a
set
apology
i
must
say
added
his
wife
to
her
visitor
that
it
the
same
with
me
you
know
there
was
a
pause
then
you
intend
to
call
upon
her
said
venables
coming
with
directness
to
an
obviously
premeditated
point
i
do
i
must
it
is
so
different
with
us
said
the
vicar
young
wife
with
her
pretty
brown
blush
certainly
added
the
vicar
himself
with
dogmatic
emphasis
venables
did
not
look
at
him
but
she
looked
the
harder
at
morna
instead
well
said
she
i
suppose
you
are
right
in
your
position
yes
your
position
is
quite
different
and
the
sudden
half
accidental
turn
of
her
sentence
put
venables
on
good
terms
with
herself
once
more
and
so
she
rose
all
smiles
and
velvet
no
not
even
half
a
cup
but
it
was
really
quite
delicious
and
i
hope
you
come
and
see
me
soon
and
tell
me
all
about
her
at
his
age
she
whispered
as
she
went
at
if
he
a
day
a
stranger
would
have
imagined
that
this
lady
had
quite
decided
not
to
call
upon
the
newcomer
herself
even
woodgate
was
uncertain
of
her
neighbor
intention
as
the
latter
wheels
ground
the
vicarage
drive
once
more
and
she
and
her
husband
were
left
alone
it
will
depend
upon
the
county
said
she
and
venables
is
not
the
county
pure
and
simple
she
half
northborough
still
and
take
her
cue
from
the
invernesses
and
the
uniackes
but
i
do
believe
she
been
round
the
whole
getting
people
to
say
they
wo
call
as
if
it
mattered
to
a
man
like
steel
or
any
woman
he
is
likely
to
have
chosen
still
it
is
mysterious
is
it
but
what
business
of
ours
as
you
say
only
dear
you
need
have
said
it
quite
so
pointedly
of
course
i
call
as
soon
as
i
can
in
decency
she
may
let
me
be
of
use
to
her
oh
bother
venables
if
she
does
call
no
doubt
many
others
wo
you
must
remember
that
he
has
never
entertained
as
yet
oh
what
a
dance
they
could
give
and
did
you
hear
what
she
said
about
his
age
he
is
now
the
vicar
laughed
it
was
his
habit
to
let
his
young
wife
rattle
on
when
they
were
alone
and
even
lay
down
the
law
for
him
to
her
content
but
though
fifteen
years
her
senior
and
never
a
vivacious
man
himself
there
was
much
in
their
life
that
he
saw
in
the
same
light
as
she
did
though
never
quite
so
soon
he
suddenly
repeated
with
a
fresh
chuckle
and
last
year
when
sybil
was
thought
to
be
in
the
running
poor
sybil
how
well
she
took
it
last
year
her
mother
told
me
she
knew
for
a
fact
he
was
not
a
day
more
than
poor
steel
too
he
has
done
for
them
both
in
that
quarter
i
am
afraid
and
now
added
hugh
in
his
way
as
though
they
had
been
discussing
theology
all
this
time
i
must
go
back
to
my
sermon
if
i
am
to
get
it
done
chapter
x
a
slight
discrepancy
woodgate
paid
the
promised
call
a
few
days
later
walking
briskly
by
herself
along
the
woodland
path
that
made
it
no
distance
from
marley
vicarage
to
normanthorpe
house
and
cutting
a
very
attractive
figure
among
the
shimmering
lights
and
shadows
of
the
trees
she
was
rather
tall
and
very
straight
with
the
pale
brown
skin
and
the
dark
brown
eye
which
more
especially
when
associated
with
hair
as
light
as
morna
woodgate
go
to
make
up
one
of
the
most
charming
and
distinctive
types
of
english
womanhood
morna
moreover
took
a
healthy
interest
in
her
own
appearance
and
had
not
only
the
good
taste
to
dress
well
but
the
good
sense
not
to
dress
too
well
her
new
coat
and
skirt
had
just
come
home
and
like
herself
they
fitted
and
suited
her
to
equal
perfection
morna
thought
that
she
might
even
go
to
church
in
the
coat
and
skirt
now
and
again
during
the
summer
and
she
had
a
brown
straw
hat
with
fine
feathers
of
the
lighter
shade
which
she
made
peculiarly
her
own
but
this
she
had
discarded
as
too
grand
for
an
informal
call
for
hugh
had
been
summoned
to
a
at
the
last
moment
and
might
be
detained
too
late
to
follow
but
the
steels
had
been
back
two
days
and
morna
could
not
wait
another
hour
she
was
certainly
consumed
with
curiosity
but
that
was
not
the
only
feeling
which
woodgate
entertained
towards
the
lady
who
was
to
be
a
nearer
neighbor
of
her
own
sex
and
class
than
any
she
could
count
as
yet
on
the
class
question
morna
had
no
misgivings
nevertheless
she
was
prepared
for
a
surprise
both
she
and
her
husband
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
steel
morna
had
perhaps
seen
the
best
of
him
since
she
was
at
once
young
and
charming
and
not
even
an
unwilling
and
personally
innocent
candidate
for
his
hand
like
honest
sybil
venables
yet
morna
herself
was
not
more
attracted
than
repelled
by
the
inscrutable
personality
of
this
rich
man
dropped
from
the
clouds
who
had
never
a
word
to
say
about
his
former
life
never
an
anecdote
to
tell
never
an
adventure
to
record
and
of
whom
even
venables
had
not
the
courage
to
ask
questions
what
sort
of
woman
would
such
a
man
marry
and
what
sort
of
woman
would
marry
such
a
man
morna
asked
herself
the
one
question
after
the
other
almost
as
often
as
she
set
her
right
foot
in
front
of
her
left
but
she
was
not
merely
inquisitive
in
the
matter
she
had
a
secret
and
instinctive
compassion
for
the
woman
who
had
done
this
thing
she
will
not
have
a
soul
to
call
her
own
poor
thing
thought
morna
as
indignantly
as
though
the
imaginary
evil
was
one
of
the
worst
that
could
befall
for
the
vicar
wife
had
her
little
weaknesses
not
by
any
means
regarded
as
such
by
herself
and
this
was
one
of
the
last
things
that
could
have
been
said
about
her
or
that
she
would
have
cared
to
hear
the
woodland
path
led
at
last
into
the
long
avenue
and
there
was
normanthorpe
house
at
the
end
of
the
vista
an
italian
palace
transplanted
into
the
north
of
england
radiantly
white
between
the
green
trees
and
blue
sky
with
golden
cupola
burning
in
the
sun
perhaps
the
best
specimen
extant
to
mark
a
passing
fashion
in
georgian
architecture
but
as
to
the
delverton
district
as
an
to
the
north
pole
a
cool
grotto
on
a
really
hot
day
the
house
was
an
on
any
other
or
so
woodgate
fancied
fresh
from
the
cosey
vicarage
and
warm
from
her
rapid
walk
as
she
stepped
into
another
temperature
across
polished
marble
that
struck
a
chill
through
the
soles
of
her
natty
brown
shoes
and
so
into
the
lofty
with
pilasters
and
elaborate
architraves
to
the
doors
what
a
place
for
a
sane
man
to
build
in
bleak
old
delverton
even
before
there
was
any
northborough
to
blacken
and
foul
the
wind
on
its
way
from
the
sea
what
a
place
for
a
sane
man
to
buy
and
yet
in
its
cool
white
smoothness
its
glaring
individuality
its
alien
air
how
like
the
buyer
though
it
was
may
and
warm
enough
for
the
month
and
place
morna
got
up
when
the
footman
had
left
her
and
thrust
one
brown
shoe
after
the
other
as
near
as
she
could
to
the
wood
fire
that
glimmered
underneath
the
great
ornate
marble
mantelpiece
then
she
sat
down
again
and
wondered
what
to
say
for
morna
was
at
once
above
and
below
the
conversational
average
of
her
kind
soon
she
was
framing
a
apology
for
premature
intrusion
steel
was
so
long
in
coming
but
at
last
there
was
a
rustle
in
the
conservatory
and
a
slender
figure
in
a
big
hat
stood
for
an
instant
on
the
threshold
that
was
morna
first
impression
of
the
new
mistress
of
normanthorpe
and
it
was
never
erased
from
her
mind
a
slender
silhouette
in
an
enormous
hat
the
light
all
behind
her
the
pilastered
doorway
for
a
frame
a
gay
background
of
hothouse
flowers
and
in
the
figure
itself
a
nervous
hesitancy
which
struck
an
immediate
chord
of
sympathy
in
morna
she
also
was
shy
the
touch
of
imperfect
nature
was
mutually
discernible
and
discerned
and
the
two
were
kin
from
the
meeting
of
their
hands
morna
began
her
apology
nevertheless
but
rachel
cut
it
very
short
my
dear
woodgate
i
think
it
is
so
kind
of
you
she
exclaimed
her
low
voice
full
of
the
frankest
gratitude
and
morna
was
surprised
at
the
time
it
was
as
though
she
were
the
rich
man
wife
and
steel
the
vicar
they
sat
a
little
talking
of
the
time
of
year
and
it
was
some
minutes
before
morna
really
saw
her
new
neighbor
face
what
with
her
great
hat
and
the
position
of
the
chair
which
steel
selected
and
for
these
few
minutes
after
that
first
frank
speech
the
greater
constraint
was
on
the
part
of
the
hostess
then
all
at
once
she
seemed
to
throw
it
off
rising
impulsively
as
though
the
great
high
room
with
the
italian
tiles
and
the
garish
gilt
furniture
struck
the
same
chill
to
her
as
to
morna
before
her
come
round
the
garden
said
rachel
quickly
i
am
delighted
with
the
garden
and
i
think
it
really
warmer
than
the
house
delightful
it
certainly
was
or
rather
they
for
the
normanthorpe
gardens
were
never
spoken
of
in
the
singular
number
by
those
familiar
with
their
fame
they
had
been
reconstructed
and
enlarged
by
a
dead
duke
with
a
fad
for
botany
and
kept
up
by
successors
who
could
not
endure
the
cold
uncomfortable
house
it
was
said
to
have
been
a
similar
taste
in
steel
which
had
first
attracted
him
to
the
place
but
as
he
never
confirmed
or
contradicted
anything
that
was
said
of
him
and
would
only
smile
when
a
rumor
reached
his
ears
there
was
no
real
foundation
for
the
report
the
ducal
botanist
had
left
behind
him
the
rarest
collection
of
plants
and
trees
and
a
tradition
in
scientific
gardening
which
had
not
been
allowed
to
die
it
was
neglected
normanthorpe
that
had
loaded
the
tables
and
replenished
the
greenhouses
of
seats
more
favored
by
the
family
and
all
this
was
the
more
wonderful
as
a
triumph
of
art
over
some
natural
disadvantages
in
the
way
of
soil
and
climate
the
normanthorpe
roses
famous
throughout
the
north
of
england
were
as
yet
barely
budding
in
the
kindless
wind
the
blaze
of
early
bulbs
was
over
but
there
were
the
curious
alien
trees
and
the
ornamental
waters
haunted
by
outlandish
wildfowl
bred
there
on
the
same
principle
of
acclimatization
i
expect
you
know
the
way
quite
well
said
rachel
as
they
followed
a
winding
path
over
a
bank
of
rhododendrons
near
the
lake
to
me
every
stroll
is
still
a
voyage
of
exploration
and
i
shall
be
rather
sorry
when
i
begin
to
know
exactly
what
i
am
going
to
see
next
now
i
have
never
been
this
way
before
and
have
no
idea
what
is
coming
so
you
must
tell
me
if
you
know
what
a
funny
scent
i
seem
to
know
it
too
why
what
have
they
got
here
on
the
further
side
of
the
bank
of
rhododendrons
the
path
had
descended
into
a
sheltered
hollow
screened
altogether
from
the
colder
winds
and
even
in
this
temperate
month
of
may
a
very
trap
for
the
afternoon
sun
and
in
this
hollow
was
a
clump
of
attenuated
trees
with
drooping
leaves
of
a
lacklustre
hue
and
a
white
bark
peeling
from
the
trunk
a
pungent
aroma
more
medicinal
than
sylvan
hung
rather
heavily
over
the
sequestered
spot
rachel
stood
a
moment
with
wide
nostrils
and
round
eyes
the
look
hardly
lasted
longer
and
she
said
no
more
but
she
was
aware
that
morna
had
made
some
answer
to
her
question
what
did
you
say
inquired
rachel
turning
politely
to
her
visitor
i
said
they
were
blue
gums
from
australia
rachel
made
no
immediate
comment
secretive
she
might
have
to
be
but
to
a
deliberate
pretence
she
would
not
stoop
so
she
did
not
even
say
indeed
but
merely
after
a
pause
you
are
something
of
a
botanist
yourself
then
mrs
woodgate
for
they
had
been
talking
of
the
gardens
and
of
their
history
as
they
walked
i
laughed
morna
i
only
wish
i
was
but
i
happen
to
remember
steel
telling
me
that
one
day
when
we
were
here
last
summer
rachel
opened
her
eyes
again
and
her
lips
with
them
but
instead
of
speaking
she
went
to
the
nearest
and
picked
a
spray
of
the
lacklustre
leaves
i
like
the
smell
of
them
she
said
as
they
went
on
and
the
little
incident
left
no
impression
upon
morna
mind
yet
presently
she
perceived
that
steel
had
some
color
after
all
at
the
moment
rachel
happened
to
be
smelling
her
and
that
she
was
altogether
prettier
than
morna
had
fancied
hitherto
the
fact
was
that
it
was
her
first
good
look
at
rachel
who
had
kept
her
back
to
the
light
indoors
and
had
literally
led
the
way
along
the
narrow
paths
while
her
large
hat
had
supplied
a
perpetual
shadow
of
its
own
it
was
a
pathetic
habit
which
had
become
second
nature
with
rachel
during
the
last
six
months
but
now
for
once
it
was
forgotten
and
her
face
raised
unguardedly
to
the
sun
which
painted
it
in
its
true
and
sweet
colors
to
morna
surprise
and
real
delight
the
vicar
wife
was
one
of
those
young
women
who
are
the
first
to
admire
their
own
sex
she
had
very
many
friends
among
women
for
whom
marriage
had
not
damped
an
enthusiasm
which
she
hid
from
no
one
but
themselves
and
she
was
to
be
sufficiently
enthusiastic
about
the
thin
but
perfect
oval
of
rachel
face
the
soft
sweet
hazel
of
her
eyes
the
impetuous
upper
lip
and
the
brave
lower
one
as
she
saw
them
now
for
an
instant
in
the
afternoon
sun
moreover
she
was
already
interested
in
rachel
on
her
own
account
and
not
only
as
the
wife
of
the
mysterious
steel
there
was
an
undoubted
air
of
mystery
about
her
also
but
that
might
only
be
derived
from
him
and
with
all
her
reserve
she
could
not
conceal
a
sweet
and
sympathetic
self
from
one
as
like
her
in
that
essential
as
they
were
different
in
all
others
not
that
the
reserve
was
all
on
one
side
morna
woodgate
had
her
own
secrets
too
one
of
them
however
was
extracted
during
their
stroll
may
i
make
a
personal
remark
asked
rachel
who
had
been
admiring
the
pale
brown
face
of
morna
in
her
turn
as
they
came
slowly
back
to
the
house
across
the
lawns
you
frighten
me
said
morna
laughing
but
let
me
hear
the
worst
it
the
ribbon
on
your
hat
went
on
rachel
what
pretty
colors
are
they
your
husband
school
or
college
no
said
morna
blushing
as
she
laughed
again
no
they
my
own
college
colors
rachel
stood
still
on
the
grass
have
you
really
been
at
college
said
she
but
her
tone
was
so
obviously
one
of
envy
that
morna
who
was
delightfully
sensitive
about
her
learning
did
not
even
think
of
the
short
answer
which
she
sometimes
returned
to
the
astonished
queries
of
the
intellectually
vulgar
but
admitted
the
impeachment
with
another
laugh
now
do
say
you
would
have
thought
it
of
me
she
added
and
do
say
you
would
i
am
far
too
jealous
to
say
anything
at
all
rachel
answered
with
a
flattering
stare
and
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
took
a
degree
of
sorts
admitted
morna
whose
spoken
english
was
by
no
means
undefiled
but
it
turned
out
to
have
been
a
mathematical
degree
and
when
under
sympathetic
pressure
morna
vouchsafed
particulars
even
rachel
knew
enough
to
appreciate
the
honors
which
the
vicar
wife
had
won
what
was
more
difficult
to
understand
was
how
so
young
a
woman
of
such
distinguished
attainments
could
be
content
to
hide
her
light
under
the
bushel
of
a
country
vicarage
and
rachel
could
not
resist
some
expression
of
her
wonderment
on
that
point
did
you
do
nothing
with
it
all
she
asked
before
you
married
no
said
morna
you
see
i
got
engaged
in
the
middle
of
it
and
the
week
after
the
lists
came
out
we
were
married
what
a
career
to
have
given
up
i
would
give
it
up
again
said
morna
with
a
warmer
blush
and
rachel
was
left
with
a
deeper
envy
i
am
afraid
we
shall
have
nothing
in
common
sighed
steel
as
they
neared
the
house
i
have
no
education
worthy
the
name
morna
waxed
all
but
indignant
at
the
implication
she
had
a
morbid
horror
of
being
considered
a
which
she
revealed
with
much
girlish
naïveté
and
unconscious
simplicity
of
sentiment
and
praise
she
was
not
so
narrow
as
all
that
she
had
had
enough
of
learning
she
had
forgotten
all
that
she
had
learnt
any
dolt
could
be
crammed
to
pass
examinations
on
the
contrary
she
was
quite
sure
they
would
have
heaps
in
common
for
example
she
was
longing
for
some
one
to
bicycle
with
her
husband
seldom
had
the
time
and
he
did
not
care
for
her
to
go
quite
alone
in
the
country
roads
but
i
do
bicycle
said
steel
shaking
her
head
rather
sadly
ah
i
forgot
people
who
ride
and
drive
never
do
and
it
was
turn
to
sigh
no
i
should
like
it
but
i
have
never
tried
i
teach
you
cried
morna
at
once
what
fun
it
will
be
i
should
enjoy
it
i
know
but
the
sentence
was
abandoned
as
was
often
the
case
in
the
subsequent
intercourse
between
rachel
steel
and
morna
woodgate
from
the
beginning
rachel
was
apt
to
be
more
off
her
guard
with
morna
than
with
any
one
whom
she
had
met
during
the
last
six
months
and
from
the
beginning
she
was
continually
remembering
and
stopping
herself
in
a
manner
that
would
have
irritated
morna
in
anybody
else
but
then
yet
again
from
the
beginning
these
two
were
natural
and
immediate
friends
you
must
learn
urged
morna
when
she
had
waited
some
time
for
the
sentence
which
had
but
begun
there
are
people
who
scorn
it
or
pretend
to
but
i
am
sure
you
are
not
one
it
may
not
be
the
finest
form
of
exercise
but
wait
till
you
fly
down
these
hills
with
your
feet
on
the
rests
and
then
you
are
so
independent
no
horses
to
consider
no
coachman
to
consult
only
your
own
bones
and
your
own
self
the
independence
alone
may
be
the
very
thing
for
you
woodgate
but
it
would
do
for
my
wife
steel
had
stolen
a
silent
march
upon
them
on
the
soft
smooth
grass
and
now
he
was
taking
off
his
straw
hat
to
morna
and
smiling
with
all
urbanity
as
he
held
out
his
hand
but
morna
had
seen
how
his
wife
started
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
her
greeting
was
a
little
cool
i
meant
the
bicycling
he
was
quick
enough
to
add
not
the
independence
of
course
but
there
was
something
sinister
in
his
smile
something
quite
sinister
and
yet
not
unkindly
that
vexed
and
puzzled
morna
during
the
remainder
of
her
visit
which
she
cut
somewhat
short
on
perceiving
that
steel
had
apparently
no
intention
of
leaving
them
to
their
own
devices
after
tea
morna
however
would
have
been
still
more
puzzled
and
her
spirit
not
less
vexed
had
she
heard
the
first
words
between
the
newly
married
couple
after
she
had
gone
what
that
you
have
got
asked
steel
as
they
turned
back
up
the
drive
after
seeing
morna
to
her
woodland
path
rachel
was
still
carrying
her
spray
of
he
must
have
noticed
it
before
but
this
was
the
first
sign
that
he
had
done
so
she
said
at
once
what
it
was
and
why
she
had
pulled
it
from
the
tree
it
took
me
back
to
victoria
and
you
know
i
was
born
there
steel
looked
narrowly
at
his
wife
a
hard
gleam
in
his
inscrutable
eyes
and
yet
a
lurking
sympathy
too
nor
was
there
anything
but
the
latter
in
the
tone
and
tenor
of
his
reply
i
do
forget
he
said
and
i
think
i
can
understand
but
neither
must
you
forget
that
i
offered
to
take
you
back
there
so
that
a
sprig
of
is
it
rachel
gave
him
a
sudden
glance
which
for
once
he
missed
being
absorbed
in
a
curious
examination
of
the
leaves
did
you
never
see
one
before
she
asked
a
said
steel
without
looking
up
as
he
sniffed
and
scrutinized
never
in
all
my
life
to
my
knowledge
chapter
xi
another
new
friend
the
country
folk
did
call
upon
the
steels
as
indeed
they
could
scarcely
fail
to
do
having
called
on
him
already
as
a
bachelor
the
year
before
nor
were
the
uniackes
and
the
invernesses
the
of
the
flock
those
august
families
had
returned
to
london
for
the
season
but
the
taboo
by
venables
had
begun
and
ended
in
her
own
mind
indeed
that
potent
and
diplomatic
dame
who
was
the
undoubted
leader
of
society
within
a
radius
of
northborough
town
hall
was
the
first
to
recognize
the
mistake
that
she
had
made
and
to
behave
as
though
she
had
never
made
it
quite
early
in
june
the
steels
were
bidden
to
a
in
their
honor
at
upthorpe
hall
mrs
venables
cried
rachel
in
dismay
is
that
the
gushing
woman
with
the
quiet
daughters
who
called
last
thursday
that
is
the
lady
said
steel
a
gleam
of
humor
in
his
grim
eyes
he
never
expressed
an
opinion
to
his
wife
about
any
one
of
their
neighbors
but
when
she
let
fall
an
impression
of
her
own
he
would
look
at
her
in
this
way
as
though
it
was
the
very
one
that
he
had
formed
for
himself
a
year
ago
but
need
we
go
asked
rachel
with
open
apprehension
i
think
so
he
said
why
not
a
of
all
things
there
is
no
cover
at
the
you
ca
even
wear
a
hat
you
must
sit
there
in
a
glare
for
hours
and
hours
and
rachel
shuddered
oh
do
let
us
go
she
urged
but
her
tone
was
neither
pathetic
nor
despairing
though
free
from
the
faintest
accent
of
affection
it
was
nevertheless
the
tone
of
a
woman
who
has
not
always
been
denied
i
am
afraid
we
must
go
he
said
firmly
but
not
unkindly
you
see
it
is
in
our
honor
as
i
happen
to
know
for
venables
gave
me
a
hint
when
i
met
him
in
the
town
the
other
day
he
will
take
you
in
himself
and
what
is
he
like
fond
of
his
dinner
he
wo
worry
you
said
steel
reassuringly
nor
need
you
really
bother
your
head
about
all
that
any
more
nobody
has
recognized
you
yet
nobody
is
in
the
least
likely
to
do
so
down
here
do
you
see
how
delightfully
provincial
they
are
there
a
local
lawyer
a
pillar
of
all
the
virtues
who
has
misappropriated
his
own
marriage
portion
and
fled
the
country
with
the
principal
boy
in
their
last
pantomime
there
are
a
lot
of
smart
young
fellows
who
are
making
a
sporting
thousand
every
other
day
out
of
iron
warrants
the
district
looking
up
after
thirty
years
bad
times
and
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
it
talking
about
these
are
its
heroes
and
its
villains
all
you
hear
from
london
is
what
the
last
man
spent
when
he
was
up
and
where
he
dined
and
from
all
i
can
gather
the
tichborne
trial
made
less
impression
down
here
than
that
of
a
delverton
parson
who
got
into
trouble
about
the
same
time
they
must
have
heard
of
my
trial
said
rachel
in
a
low
voice
they
were
walking
in
the
grounds
after
breakfast
but
she
looked
round
before
speaking
at
all
they
would
glance
at
it
said
steel
with
a
shrug
an
occasional
schoolboy
might
read
it
through
but
even
if
you
were
guilty
and
were
here
on
view
you
would
command
much
less
attention
than
the
local
malefactor
in
an
infinitely
smaller
way
i
am
sorry
i
put
it
quite
like
that
added
steel
as
rachel
winced
but
i
feel
convinced
about
it
and
only
wish
i
could
convince
you
and
he
did
so
more
or
less
but
the
fear
of
recognition
had
increased
in
rachel
instead
of
abating
as
time
went
on
it
had
increased
especially
since
the
rapid
ripening
of
her
acquaintance
with
morna
woodgate
into
the
intimacy
which
already
subsisted
between
the
two
young
wives
rachel
had
told
her
husband
that
she
would
not
have
morna
know
for
anything
and
he
had
appeared
in
his
own
dark
way
to
sympathize
with
a
solicitude
which
was
more
actual
than
necessary
but
that
was
perhaps
because
he
approved
of
woodgate
on
his
own
account
and
so
rare
was
that
approval
as
a
positive
and
known
quantity
yet
so
marked
in
this
case
that
he
usually
contrived
to
share
morna
society
with
his
wife
you
shall
not
monopolize
woodgate
he
would
say
with
all
urbanity
as
he
joined
them
when
least
expected
i
was
first
in
the
field
you
know
and
in
the
field
he
would
remain
there
were
no
commands
no
wishes
to
obey
in
the
matter
no
embargo
upon
the
comings
and
goings
between
the
two
new
friends
but
steel
invariably
appeared
upon
the
scene
as
well
the
good
vicar
attributed
it
to
the
elderly
bridegroom
jealous
infatuation
for
his
beautiful
young
bride
but
morna
knew
better
from
the
first
are
you
going
asked
rachel
eagerly
when
she
and
morna
met
again
indeed
she
had
gone
expressly
to
the
vicarage
to
ask
the
question
and
not
until
she
had
seen
the
woodgates
invitation
could
steel
himself
induce
her
to
answer
theirs
the
woodgates
were
going
morna
was
already
in
alternate
fits
of
despair
and
of
ideas
about
her
dress
i
wish
i
might
dress
you
said
rachel
knowing
her
well
enough
already
to
say
that
i
have
wardrobes
full
of
them
and
yet
my
husband
insists
upon
taking
me
up
to
london
to
get
something
fit
to
wear
but
not
necessarily
on
your
back
cried
steel
himself
appearing
at
that
moment
in
his
usual
way
warm
breathless
but
only
playfully
put
out
my
dear
woodgate
i
must
have
a
special
wire
between
your
house
and
ours
one
thing
however
i
always
know
where
to
find
her
did
she
tell
you
we
go
by
the
from
northborough
it
was
something
to
wear
upon
her
neck
a
diamond
necklet
of
superb
stones
gradually
swelling
to
one
of
the
first
water
at
the
throat
and
rachel
duly
wore
it
at
the
with
a
rich
gown
of
bridal
white
whose
dazzling
purity
had
perhaps
the
effect
of
cancelling
the
bride
own
pallor
but
she
was
very
pale
it
was
her
first
appearance
at
a
gathering
of
the
kind
not
only
there
in
delverton
but
anywhere
at
all
since
her
second
marriage
and
the
invitation
had
been
of
the
correct
most
ample
length
it
had
had
time
to
wind
itself
about
rachel
nerves
venables
who
of
course
did
take
her
in
by
no
means
belied
her
husband
description
of
him
he
was
a
rotund
man
with
a
high
complexion
and
his
bulging
eye
was
on
the
menu
before
his
soft
body
had
sunk
into
his
chair
his
conversation
proved
limited
but
strictly
to
the
point
he
told
rachel
what
to
eat
and
once
or
twice
what
to
avoid
lavished
impersonal
praise
upon
one
dish
impartial
criticisms
upon
another
and
only
spoke
between
the
courses
it
was
a
large
sat
down
rachel
was
at
last
driven
to
glancing
at
the
other
twenty
to
the
man
on
her
left
she
had
not
been
introduced
but
he
had
offered
one
or
two
civil
observations
while
venables
was
better
engaged
and
after
the
second
rachel
had
chanced
to
catch
sight
of
the
card
upon
which
his
name
had
been
inscribed
he
was
it
seemed
a
langholm
and
all
at
once
rachel
leant
back
and
looked
at
him
he
was
a
man
with
a
fine
open
countenance
and
a
great
disorderly
moustache
his
hair
might
have
been
shorter
and
his
shone
where
it
caught
the
light
rachel
put
the
screw
upon
her
courage
these
cards
she
said
with
a
glimpse
of
her
own
colonial
self
are
very
handy
when
one
has
been
introduced
your
name
is
not
very
common
is
it
not
very
he
answered
spelt
like
that
yes
it
spelt
the
same
way
as
the
langholm
who
writes
it
is
then
are
you
any
relation
i
am
the
man
himself
said
langholm
with
quite
a
hearty
laugh
accompanied
by
a
flush
of
pleasurable
embarrassment
he
was
not
a
particularly
popular
writer
and
this
did
not
happen
to
him
every
day
i
hoped
you
were
said
rachel
as
she
helped
herself
to
the
first
then
you
have
read
my
books
he
chuckled
and
you
never
must
but
i
have
protested
rachel
quite
flushed
in
her
turn
by
the
small
excitement
i
read
heaps
of
them
in
tauchnitz
when
we
were
abroad
but
i
had
no
idea
that
i
should
ever
meet
you
in
the
flesh
really
he
said
then
that
funnier
still
but
i
suppose
steel
did
want
to
frighten
you
we
saw
quite
a
lot
of
each
other
last
year
he
wrote
to
me
from
florence
before
you
came
over
and
i
should
have
paid
my
respects
long
ago
but
i
have
been
up
in
town
and
only
just
come
back
the
flush
had
died
out
of
rachel
face
her
husband
told
her
nothing
nothing
in
her
indignation
she
was
tempted
to
say
so
to
the
stranger
she
had
to
think
a
moment
what
to
say
instead
a
falsehood
of
any
sort
was
always
a
peculiar
difficulty
to
rachel
a
constitutional
aversion
and
it
cost
her
an
effort
to
remark
at
last
that
it
was
very
stupid
of
her
she
had
quite
forgotten
but
now
she
remembered
of
course
and
with
that
she
turned
to
her
host
who
was
offering
an
observation
across
his
empty
plate
strange
thing
steel
but
you
ca
get
the
meat
in
the
country
that
you
can
in
town
those
fillets
now
i
wish
you
could
taste
at
my
club
but
we
give
our
chef
a
thousand
a
year
and
he
drives
up
every
day
in
his
brougham
the
novels
of
charles
langholm
were
chiefly
remarkable
for
their
intricate
plots
and
for
the
hope
of
better
things
that
breathed
through
the
cheap
sensation
of
the
best
of
them
but
it
was
a
hope
that
had
been
deferred
a
good
many
years
his
manner
was
better
than
his
matter
indeed
an
incongruous
polish
was
said
by
the
literary
to
prevent
langholm
from
being
a
first
favorite
either
with
the
great
public
or
the
little
critics
as
a
maker
of
plots
however
he
still
had
humble
points
and
rachel
assured
him
that
she
had
burnt
her
candle
all
night
in
order
to
solve
one
of
his
ingenious
mysteries
what
he
cried
you
call
yourself
a
lady
and
you
do
look
at
the
end
before
you
reach
it
not
when
it
a
good
book
well
you
have
pitched
on
about
the
best
of
a
bad
lot
and
it
a
satisfaction
to
know
you
did
cut
the
knot
it
took
some
months
to
tie
rachel
was
greatly
interested
she
had
never
before
met
a
literary
man
had
no
idea
how
the
trick
was
done
and
she
asked
many
of
those
ingenuous
questions
which
seldom
really
displease
the
average
gentleman
of
this
type
when
not
expatiating
upon
the
heroine
whom
the
exigencies
of
serial
rights
demanded
in
his
books
charles
langholm
the
talker
and
the
man
was
an
unmuzzled
misogynist
but
nobody
would
have
suspected
it
from
his
answers
to
rachel
questions
or
from
any
portion
of
their
animated
conversation
certainly
the
aquiline
lady
whom
langholm
had
taken
in
and
to
whom
he
was
only
attentive
by
remorseful
fits
and
penitential
starts
had
not
that
satisfaction
for
her
neighbor
did
not
speak
to
her
at
all
there
was
thus
one
close
and
critical
follower
of
a
conversation
which
without
warning
took
the
one
dramatic
turn
for
which
rachel
was
forever
on
her
guard
only
this
once
in
an
hour
of
unexpected
entertainment
was
she
not
how
do
i
get
my
plots
said
langholm
sometimes
out
of
my
head
as
they
say
in
the
nursery
occasionally
from
real
life
more
often
a
blend
of
the
two
combined
you
do
often
get
a
present
from
the
newspaper
that
you
can
lift
into
a
magazine
more
or
less
as
it
stands
facts
are
stubborn
things
they
wo
serialize
but
now
and
then
there
a
case
there
was
one
a
little
time
ago
oh
there
was
a
great
case
not
long
since
if
we
had
but
the
man
to
handle
it
without
spoiling
it
in
english
fiction
and
what
was
that
the
minchin
case
and
he
looked
straight
at
her
as
one
only
looks
at
one
neighbor
at
table
when
one
is
saying
or
hearing
something
out
of
the
common
he
turned
half
round
and
he
looked
in
rachel
face
with
the
smile
of
an
artist
with
a
masterpiece
in
his
eye
it
was
an
inevitable
moment
come
at
last
when
least
expected
instinct
however
had
prepared
rachel
just
one
moment
before
and
after
all
she
could
stare
coldly
on
his
enthusiasm
without
a
start
or
a
tremor
to
betray
the
pose
yes
she
said
her
fine
eyebrows
raised
a
little
and
do
you
really
think
that
would
make
a
book
it
was
characteristic
of
rachel
that
she
did
not
for
a
moment
even
that
moment
pretend
to
be
unfamiliar
with
the
case
do
you
he
asked
i
have
thought
about
it
said
rachel
looking
pensively
at
the
flowers
but
surely
it
was
a
very
sordid
case
the
case
he
cried
yes
sordid
as
you
like
but
i
do
mean
the
case
at
all
then
what
do
you
mean
mr
langholm
her
after
life
he
whispered
the
psychology
of
that
woman
and
her
subsequent
adventures
she
disappeared
into
thin
air
immediately
after
the
trial
i
suppose
you
knew
that
i
did
hear
it
rachel
moistened
her
lips
with
champagne
well
i
should
take
her
from
that
moment
said
langholm
i
should
start
her
story
there
and
should
you
make
her
guilty
or
not
guilty
ah
said
langholm
as
though
that
would
require
consideration
unluckily
he
paused
to
consider
on
the
spot
who
are
you
talking
about
inquired
venables
who
had
caught
rachel
last
words
minchin
she
told
him
steadily
guilty
cried
venables
with
great
energy
guilty
and
i
have
gone
to
see
her
hanged
myself
and
venables
beamed
upon
rachel
as
though
proud
of
the
sentiment
while
the
diamonds
rose
and
fell
upon
her
white
neck
where
he
would
have
had
the
rope
a
greater
scandal
he
went
on
both
to
rachel
and
to
the
lady
on
his
other
side
who
interrupted
venables
to
express
devout
agreement
a
greater
scandal
and
miscarriage
of
justice
i
have
never
known
guilty
of
course
she
was
guilty
and
i
only
wish
we
could
try
her
again
and
hang
her
yet
now
do
pretend
you
sympathize
with
a
woman
like
that
he
said
to
rachel
with
a
look
like
a
nudge
you
have
been
married
long
enough
and
for
heaven
sake
do
refuse
that
bird
the
best
that
can
be
got
this
time
of
year
though
that
not
saying
much
but
wait
till
the
grouse
season
steel
i
have
a
moor
here
in
the
dales
keep
a
cellar
full
of
them
and
eat
as
they
drop
off
the
string
well
said
rachel
turning
to
langholm
when
her
host
became
a
busy
man
once
more
i
should
make
her
guilty
said
the
novelist
and
she
would
marry
a
man
who
believed
in
her
innocence
and
he
would
care
two
pins
when
she
told
him
the
truth
in
the
last
chapter
and
they
would
live
happily
ever
afterwards
nobody
would
touch
the
serial
rights
but
that
would
be
a
book
then
do
you
think
she
really
was
guilty
and
rachel
waited
while
he
shrugged
her
heart
beating
for
no
good
reason
that
she
knew
except
that
she
rather
liked
langholm
and
did
not
wish
to
cease
liking
him
on
the
spot
but
it
was
to
him
that
the
answer
was
big
with
fate
and
he
trifled
and
dallied
with
the
issue
of
the
moment
little
dreaming
what
a
mark
it
was
to
leave
upon
his
life
while
the
paradox
beloved
of
the
literary
took
shape
on
his
tongue
what
does
it
matter
what
she
was
what
do
the
facts
matter
steel
when
one
has
an
idea
like
that
for
fiction
fiction
is
truer
than
fact
but
you
have
answered
my
question
rachel
meant
to
have
that
answer
oh
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
read
the
case
pretty
closely
and
i
was
thankful
the
jury
brought
in
an
acquittal
it
required
a
little
imagination
but
the
truth
always
does
it
is
no
treason
to
our
host
to
whisper
that
he
has
none
i
remember
having
quite
a
heated
argument
with
him
at
the
time
oh
dear
no
she
was
no
more
guilty
than
you
or
i
but
it
would
be
a
thousand
times
more
artistic
if
she
were
and
i
should
make
her
so
by
jove
rachel
finished
her
dinner
in
great
tranquillity
after
this
but
there
was
a
flush
upon
her
face
which
had
not
been
there
before
and
langholm
received
an
astonishing
smile
when
the
ladies
rose
he
had
been
making
tardy
atonement
for
his
neglect
of
the
aquiline
lady
but
rachel
had
the
last
word
with
him
you
will
come
and
see
us
wo
you
she
said
i
shall
want
to
hear
how
the
plot
works
out
i
am
afraid
it
one
i
ca
afford
to
use
he
said
unless
i
stick
to
foolish
fact
and
make
her
innocent
and
she
left
him
with
a
wry
face
her
own
glowing
again
you
looked
simply
great
especially
towards
the
end
whispered
morna
woodgate
in
the
for
she
alone
knew
how
nervous
rachel
had
been
about
what
was
indeed
her
social
debut
in
delverton
the
aquiline
lady
also
had
a
word
to
say
her
eyes
were
like
brown
beads
and
her
nose
very
long
which
gave
her
indeed
a
appearance
somewhat
unusual
in
a
woman
but
her
gravity
was
rather
that
of
the
owl
you
talked
a
great
deal
to
langholm
said
she
sounding
her
rebuke
rather
cleverly
in
the
key
of
mere
statement
of
fact
have
you
read
his
books
mrs
steel
some
of
them
said
rachel
have
you
oh
no
i
never
read
novels
unless
it
be
george
eliot
or
in
these
days
humphrey
ward
it
such
waste
of
time
when
there
are
browning
ruskin
and
carlyle
to
read
and
read
again
i
know
i
like
langholm
i
am
sure
they
are
dreadfully
uncultured
and
sensational
but
i
like
sensation
rachel
said
i
like
to
be
taken
out
of
myself
so
you
suggested
he
should
write
a
novel
about
mrs
minchin
no
i
did
suggest
it
said
rachel
hurriedly
but
the
beady
brown
eyes
were
upon
her
and
she
felt
herself
reddening
horribly
as
she
spoke
you
seemed
to
know
all
about
her
said
the
aquiline
lady
i
not
in
the
habit
of
reading
such
cases
but
i
must
really
look
this
one
up
chapter
xii
episode
of
the
invisible
visitor
that
was
something
like
a
summer
as
the
saying
is
and
for
once
they
could
say
it
even
on
the
bleak
northern
spurs
of
the
delverton
hills
there
were
days
upon
days
when
that
minor
chain
looked
blue
and
noble
as
the
mountains
of
alsace
and
hackneyed
song
seen
with
an
envious
eye
from
the
grimy
outskirts
of
northborough
and
when
from
the
hills
themselves
the
only
blot
upon
the
fair
english
landscape
was
the
pall
of
smoke
that
always
overhung
the
town
on
such
days
normanthorpe
house
justified
its
existence
in
the
north
of
england
instead
of
in
southern
italy
the
marble
hall
so
chill
to
the
tread
at
the
end
of
may
was
the
one
really
cool
spot
in
the
district
by
the
beginning
of
july
and
nowhere
could
a
more
delightful
afternoon
be
spent
by
those
who
cared
to
avail
themselves
of
a
general
invitation
the
steels
had
not
as
yet
committed
themselves
to
formal
hospitality
of
the
somewhat
showy
character
that
obtained
in
the
neighborhood
but
they
kept
open
house
for
all
who
liked
to
come
and
whom
they
themselves
liked
well
enough
to
ask
in
the
first
instance
and
here
as
in
some
other
matters
this
curious
pair
discovered
a
reflex
identity
of
taste
rare
enough
in
the
happiest
of
conventional
couples
but
a
gratuitous
irony
in
the
makers
of
a
merely
nominal
marriage
their
mutual
feelings
towards
each
other
were
a
quantity
unknown
to
either
but
about
a
third
person
they
were
equally
outspoken
and
unanimous
thus
they
had
fewer
disagreements
than
many
a
loving
couple
and
perhaps
more
points
of
insignificant
contact
while
all
the
time
there
was
not
even
the
pretence
of
love
between
them
their
lives
made
a
chasm
bridged
by
threads
this
was
not
seen
by
more
than
two
of
their
acquaintance
morna
woodgate
had
both
the
observation
and
the
opportunities
to
see
a
little
how
the
land
lay
between
them
charles
langholm
had
the
experience
and
the
imagination
to
guess
a
good
deal
but
it
was
little
enough
that
morna
saw
and
langholm
guesses
were
as
wide
of
the
mark
as
only
the
guesses
of
an
imaginative
man
can
be
as
for
all
the
rest
honest
hugh
woodgate
the
venables
girls
and
their
friends
the
young
men
in
the
various
works
who
saw
the
courtesy
with
which
steel
always
treated
his
wife
and
the
grace
and
charm
of
her
consideration
for
him
they
were
every
one
receiving
a
liberal
object
lesson
in
matrimony
as
some
of
them
even
realized
at
the
time
i
wish
i
could
learn
to
treat
my
wife
as
steel
does
his
sighed
the
good
vicar
once
when
he
had
been
inattentive
at
the
table
and
morna
had
rebuked
him
in
fun
that
would
be
my
ideal
if
i
was
too
old
to
learn
then
thank
goodness
you
are
rejoined
his
wife
let
me
catch
you
dancing
in
front
of
me
to
open
the
doors
hugh
and
i
shall
keep
my
eye
on
you
as
i
never
kept
it
yet
but
rachel
herself
did
not
dislike
these
little
graces
partly
because
they
were
not
put
on
to
impress
an
audience
but
were
an
incident
of
their
private
life
as
well
and
partly
because
they
stimulated
a
study
to
which
she
had
only
given
herself
since
their
return
to
england
and
their
establishment
at
normanthorpe
house
this
was
her
study
of
the
man
who
was
still
calmly
studying
her
she
was
returning
the
compliment
at
last
and
of
his
character
she
formed
by
degrees
some
remote
conception
he
was
steel
by
name
and
steel
by
nature
as
the
least
observant
might
discern
and
the
least
witty
remark
a
grim
inscrutability
was
his
dominant
note
he
was
darkly
alert
mysteriously
vigilant
a
measurer
of
words
a
governor
of
glances
and
yet
with
all
his
and
mastery
of
others
there
were
human
traits
that
showed
themselves
from
time
to
time
as
the
months
wore
on
rachel
did
not
recognize
among
these
that
studious
consideration
which
she
could
still
appreciate
it
seemed
rather
part
of
a
preconceived
method
of
treating
his
wife
and
the
wary
eye
gleamed
through
it
all
but
it
has
been
mentioned
that
rachel
at
one
time
had
a
voice
of
which
high
hopes
had
been
formed
by
inexperienced
judges
it
was
only
at
normanthorpe
that
her
second
husband
became
aware
of
her
possession
one
afternoon
when
she
fancied
that
she
had
the
house
to
herself
so
two
could
play
at
the
game
of
consistent
concealment
he
could
not
complain
it
was
in
the
bond
and
he
never
said
a
word
but
he
stood
outside
the
window
till
she
was
done
for
rachel
saw
him
in
a
mirror
and
for
many
an
afternoon
to
come
he
would
hover
outside
the
same
window
at
the
same
time
why
had
he
married
her
did
he
care
for
her
or
did
he
not
what
could
be
the
object
of
that
extraordinary
step
rachel
was
as
far
from
hitting
upon
a
feasible
solution
of
these
mysteries
as
she
was
from
penetrating
the
deeper
one
of
his
own
past
life
sometimes
she
put
the
like
questions
to
herself
but
they
were
more
easily
answered
she
had
been
in
desperate
straits
in
reckless
despair
even
if
her
second
marriage
had
turned
out
no
better
than
her
first
she
could
not
have
been
worse
off
than
she
was
on
the
night
of
her
acquittal
but
she
had
been
very
well
off
ever
since
then
there
had
been
the
incentive
of
adventure
the
fascination
of
that
very
mystery
which
was
a
mystery
still
and
then
yes
there
had
been
the
compelling
will
of
a
nature
infinitely
stronger
than
her
own
or
any
other
that
she
had
ever
known
did
she
regret
this
second
marriage
this
second
leap
in
the
dark
no
she
could
not
honestly
pretend
that
she
did
yet
it
had
its
sufficiently
sinister
side
its
occasional
admixture
of
sheer
horror
but
this
was
only
when
the
mysteries
which
encompassed
her
happened
to
prey
upon
nerves
unstrung
by
some
outwardly
exciting
cause
it
was
then
she
would
have
given
back
all
that
he
had
ever
given
her
to
pierce
the
veil
of
her
husband
past
here
however
the
impulse
was
more
subtle
it
was
not
the
mere
consuming
curiosity
which
one
in
rachel
position
was
bound
to
feel
it
was
rather
a
longing
to
be
convinced
that
that
veil
hid
nothing
which
should
make
her
shudder
to
live
under
the
same
roof
with
this
man
of
one
thing
she
was
quite
confident
wherever
her
husband
had
spent
or
misspent
his
life
if
any
part
of
so
successful
a
whole
could
really
have
been
misspent
it
was
not
in
england
he
was
in
a
hundred
superficial
ways
in
none
that
cut
deep
with
all
his
essential
cynicism
there
was
the
breadth
and
tolerance
of
a
travelled
man
cosmopolitan
on
the
other
hand
he
could
not
be
called
he
had
proved
himself
too
poor
a
linguist
in
every
country
that
they
had
visited
it
was
only
now
in
their
home
life
that
rachel
received
hints
of
the
truth
and
it
filled
her
with
vague
alarms
for
that
seemed
to
her
to
be
the
last
thing
he
need
have
kept
to
himself
one
day
she
saw
him
ride
a
fractious
horse
not
because
he
was
fond
of
riding
but
because
nobody
in
the
stables
could
cope
with
this
animal
steel
tamed
it
in
ten
minutes
but
a
groom
remarked
upon
the
shortness
of
his
stirrups
in
rachel
hearing
and
on
the
word
a
flash
of
memory
lit
up
her
brain
all
at
once
she
remembered
the
incident
of
the
soon
after
their
arrival
he
had
told
morna
what
they
were
yet
to
his
wife
he
had
pretended
not
to
know
if
he
also
was
an
australian
why
on
earth
should
that
fact
of
all
facts
be
concealed
from
her
nor
had
it
merely
been
concealed
it
was
a
point
upon
which
rachel
had
been
deliberately
misled
and
the
only
one
she
could
recall
she
was
still
brooding
over
it
when
a
fresh
incident
occurred
which
served
not
only
to
confirm
her
suspicions
in
this
regard
but
to
deepen
and
intensify
the
vague
horror
with
which
her
husband
presence
sometimes
inspired
her
steel
was
an
exceptionally
early
riser
it
was
his
boast
that
he
never
went
to
sleep
a
second
time
and
one
of
his
nearest
approaches
to
a
confidence
was
the
remark
that
he
owed
something
to
that
habit
now
rachel
who
was
a
bad
sleeper
kept
quite
a
different
set
of
hours
and
was
seldom
seen
outside
her
own
rooms
before
the
forenoon
one
magnificent
morning
however
she
was
tempted
to
dress
and
make
the
best
of
the
day
which
she
had
watched
breaking
shade
by
shade
the
lawns
were
gray
with
dew
the
birds
were
singing
as
they
never
sing
twice
in
one
summer
day
rachel
thought
that
for
once
she
would
like
to
be
up
and
out
before
the
sun
was
overpowering
and
she
proceeded
to
fulfil
her
wish
all
had
been
familiar
from
the
window
all
was
unfamiliar
on
the
landing
and
the
stairs
no
one
had
been
down
the
blinds
were
all
drawn
a
clock
ticked
like
a
in
the
hall
rachel
ran
downstairs
like
a
mouse
and
almost
into
the
arms
of
her
husband
whom
she
met
coming
out
of
the
with
a
loaded
tray
another
would
have
dropped
it
with
steel
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
rattle
of
the
things
but
his
color
changed
and
rachel
had
not
yet
had
such
a
look
as
he
gave
her
with
his
pursed
mouth
and
his
flashing
eyes
what
does
this
mean
he
demanded
in
the
tone
of
distant
thunder
with
little
less
than
lightning
in
his
glance
i
think
that
for
me
to
ask
laughed
rachel
standing
up
to
him
with
a
nerve
that
surprised
herself
i
did
know
that
you
began
so
early
a
decanter
and
a
glass
were
among
the
things
upon
the
tray
and
i
did
know
it
of
you
he
retorted
why
are
you
up
rachel
told
him
the
simple
truth
in
simple
fashion
his
tone
of
voice
did
not
hurt
her
there
was
no
opposite
extreme
of
tenderness
to
call
to
mind
for
the
contrast
which
inflicts
the
wound
on
the
other
hand
there
was
a
certain
satisfaction
in
having
for
once
ruffled
that
smooth
mien
and
smoother
tongue
it
was
one
of
her
rare
glimpses
of
the
real
man
but
as
usual
it
was
a
glimpse
and
nothing
more
i
must
apologize
said
steel
with
an
artificiality
which
was
seldom
so
transparent
my
only
excuse
is
that
you
startled
me
out
of
my
temper
and
my
manners
and
i
was
upset
to
begin
with
i
have
a
poor
fellow
in
rather
a
bad
way
in
the
boathouse
not
one
of
the
gardeners
i
hope
queried
rachel
but
her
kind
anxiety
subsided
in
a
moment
for
his
dark
eyes
were
measuring
her
his
dark
mind
meditating
a
lie
and
now
she
knew
him
well
enough
to
read
him
thus
far
in
his
turn
no
replied
steel
deciding
visibly
against
the
lie
no
not
one
of
our
men
or
anybody
else
belonging
to
these
parts
but
some
unlucky
tramp
whom
i
imagine
some
of
our
neighbors
would
have
given
into
custody
forthwith
i
found
him
asleep
on
the
lawn
of
course
he
had
no
business
upon
the
premises
but
he
so
far
gone
that
i
taking
him
something
to
pull
him
together
before
i
turn
him
off
i
should
have
said
remarked
rachel
thoughtfully
that
tea
or
coffee
would
have
been
better
for
him
than
spirits
steel
smiled
indulgently
across
the
tray
most
ladies
would
say
the
same
he
replied
but
very
few
men
and
why
did
you
bring
him
into
the
house
pursued
rachel
looking
her
husband
very
candidly
in
the
face
instead
of
taking
him
all
that
way
to
the
lake
and
giving
yourself
so
much
more
trouble
than
was
necessary
the
smile
broadened
upon
steel
thin
lips
perhaps
because
it
had
entirely
vanished
from
his
glittering
eyes
that
said
he
is
a
question
you
would
scarcely
ask
if
you
had
seen
the
poor
creature
for
yourself
i
do
intend
you
to
see
him
he
is
a
rather
saddening
spectacle
and
one
of
a
type
for
which
one
can
do
absolutely
nothing
permanent
and
now
if
you
are
quite
satisfied
i
shall
proceed
with
your
permission
to
get
rid
of
him
in
my
own
way
it
was
seldom
indeed
that
steel
descended
to
a
display
of
sarcasm
at
his
wife
expense
though
few
people
who
came
much
in
contact
with
him
escaped
an
occasional
flick
from
a
tongue
that
could
be
as
bitter
as
it
was
habitually
smooth
his
last
words
were
therefore
as
remarkable
as
his
first
both
were
exceptions
to
a
rule
and
though
rachel
moved
away
without
replying
feeling
that
there
was
indeed
no
more
to
be
said
she
could
not
but
dwell
upon
the
matter
in
her
mind
satisfied
she
certainly
was
not
and
yet
there
was
so
much
mystery
between
them
so
many
instinctive
reservations
upon
either
side
that
very
little
circumstance
of
the
kind
could
not
carry
an
ulterior
significance
but
many
must
be
due
to
mere
force
of
habit
rachel
hated
the
condition
of
mutual
secretiveness
upon
which
she
had
married
this
man
it
was
antagonistic
to
her
whole
nature
she
longed
to
repudiate
it
and
to
abolish
all
secrets
between
them
but
there
her
pride
stepped
in
and
closed
her
lips
and
the
intolerable
thought
that
she
would
value
her
husband
confidence
more
than
he
would
value
hers
that
she
felt
drawn
to
him
despite
every
sinister
attribute
would
bring
humiliation
and
in
its
train
it
was
the
truth
however
or
at
all
events
part
of
the
truth
yet
a
more
unfair
arrangement
rachel
had
been
unable
to
conceive
ever
since
the
fatally
reckless
moment
in
which
she
had
acquiesced
in
this
one
the
worst
that
could
be
known
about
her
was
known
to
her
husband
before
her
marriage
she
had
nothing
else
to
hide
all
concealment
of
the
past
as
between
themselves
was
upon
his
side
but
matters
were
coming
to
a
crisis
in
this
respect
and
when
rachel
deemed
it
done
with
this
incident
of
the
tramp
was
only
just
begun
it
seemed
that
the
servants
knew
of
it
and
that
it
was
not
steel
who
had
originally
discovered
the
sleeping
intruder
but
an
who
seeing
his
master
also
up
and
about
had
prudently
inquired
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
man
before
meddling
with
him
and
the
master
said
him
to
me
declared
rachel
maid
who
was
her
informant
on
the
point
as
she
combed
out
her
beautiful
brown
hair
before
the
late
breakfast
which
did
away
with
luncheon
when
there
were
no
visitors
at
normanthorpe
and
did
he
do
so
inquired
rachel
looking
with
interest
into
her
own
eyes
in
the
glass
did
he
leave
him
to
your
master
he
did
that
replied
her
maid
a
simple
yorkshire
wench
whom
rachel
herself
had
chosen
in
preference
to
the
smart
town
type
catch
any
on
not
doin
what
master
tells
them
then
did
john
see
what
happened
no
m
because
master
sent
him
to
see
if
the
chap
come
in
at
lodge
gates
or
where
and
when
he
got
back
he
was
gone
blanket
all
an
master
with
him
blanket
and
all
repeated
rachel
do
you
mean
to
say
he
had
the
impudence
to
bring
a
blanket
with
him
and
slept
in
it
cried
her
excited
little
maid
john
says
he
found
him
tucked
up
in
a
corner
of
the
lawn
out
of
the
wind
behind
some
them
shrubs
sound
asleep
and
lapped
round
and
round
in
his
blue
banket
from
head
to
heel
rachel
saw
her
own
face
change
in
the
glass
but
she
only
asked
one
more
question
and
that
with
a
smile
did
john
say
it
was
a
blue
blanket
harris
or
did
your
own
imagination
supply
the
color
he
said
it
m
faded
blue
and
pray
when
did
you
see
john
to
hear
all
this
demanded
rachel
suddenly
remembering
her
responsibility
as
mistress
of
this
young
daughter
of
the
soil
deary
me
m
responded
the
ingenuous
harris
i
did
see
him
not
more
than
any
of
the
others
he
just
comed
to
t
window
of
t
hall
as
we
were
having
our
breakfasts
and
he
told
us
all
at
once
he
was
that
full
of
it
was
john
rachel
asked
no
more
questions
but
she
was
not
altogether
sorry
that
the
matter
had
already
become
one
of
common
gossip
throughout
the
house
meanwhile
she
made
no
allusion
to
it
at
breakfast
but
her
observation
had
been
quickened
by
the
events
of
the
morning
and
thus
it
was
that
she
noticed
and
recognized
the
narrow
blue
book
which
was
too
long
for
her
husband
and
would
show
itself
as
he
stooped
over
his
coffee
it
was
his
and
rachel
had
not
seen
it
since
their
travels
that
afternoon
a
not
infrequent
visitor
arrived
on
his
bicycle
to
which
was
tied
a
bouquet
of
glorious
roses
instead
of
a
lamp
this
was
charles
langholm
the
novelist
who
had
come
to
live
in
delverton
over
two
hundred
miles
from
his
haunts
and
the
literary
chiefly
because
upon
a
tour
through
the
district
he
had
chanced
upon
what
he
never
tired
of
calling
the
ideal
cottage
of
my
dreams
though
also
for
other
reasons
unknown
in
yorkshire
his
flat
was
abandoned
before
his
effects
transplanted
at
considerable
cost
and
ever
since
langholm
had
been
a
bigoted
countryman
who
could
not
spend
a
couple
of
days
in
town
without
making
himself
offensive
on
the
subject
at
his
club
where
he
was
nevertheless
discreetly
vague
as
to
the
exact
locality
of
his
rural
paradise
even
at
the
club
however
it
was
admitted
that
his
work
had
improved
almost
as
much
as
his
appearance
and
he
put
it
all
down
to
the
roses
in
which
he
lived
embowered
for
so
many
months
of
the
year
such
was
their
profusion
that
you
could
have
filled
a
without
missing
one
and
langholm
never
visited
rich
or
poor
without
a
little
offering
out
of
his
abundance
they
may
be
coals
to
newcastle
he
would
say
to
the
woodgates
or
the
steels
but
none
of
your
tyneside
collieries
are
a
patch
on
mine
like
most
victims
of
the
artistic
temperament
the
literary
langholm
was
a
creature
of
moods
but
the
very
fact
of
a
voluntary
visit
from
him
was
sufficient
guarantee
of
the
humor
in
which
he
came
and
this
afternoon
he
was
at
his
best
he
had
indeed
been
writing
all
day
and
for
many
days
past
and
was
filled
with
the
curious
exhilaration
which
accompanies
an
output
too
rapid
and
too
continuous
to
permit
a
running
sense
of
the
defects
he
was
a
ship
with
a
fair
wind
which
he
valued
the
more
for
the
belts
of
calms
and
the
adverse
weather
through
which
he
had
passed
and
must
inevitably
pass
again
for
the
moment
he
was
a
happy
man
though
one
with
no
illusion
as
to
the
present
product
of
his
teeming
pen
it
is
nonsense
he
said
to
rachel
in
answer
to
a
question
from
that
new
and
sympathetic
friend
but
it
is
not
such
nonsense
as
to
seem
nothing
else
when
one
in
the
act
of
perpetrating
it
and
what
more
can
one
want
it
had
to
be
done
by
the
tenth
of
august
and
by
jove
it
will
be
a
few
weeks
ago
i
did
think
it
possible
but
the
summer
has
thawed
my
ink
are
you
sure
it
is
mrs
steel
asked
one
of
the
venables
girls
who
had
also
ridden
over
on
their
bicycles
i
heard
you
had
a
tremendously
literary
conversation
when
you
dined
with
us
we
had
indeed
said
langholm
with
enthusiasm
and
steel
gave
me
one
of
the
best
ideas
i
ever
had
in
my
life
that
another
reason
why
i
racing
through
this
rubbish
to
take
it
in
hand
it
was
sybil
to
whom
he
was
speaking
but
at
this
point
rachel
plunged
into
the
conversation
with
the
sister
vera
which
required
an
effort
since
the
elder
miss
venables
was
a
young
lady
who
had
cultivated
languor
as
a
sign
of
breeding
and
sophistication
rachel
however
made
the
effort
with
such
a
will
that
the
talk
became
general
in
a
moment
i
do
know
how
anybody
writes
books
was
the
elder
young
solitary
contribution
her
tone
added
that
she
did
not
want
to
know
nor
i
echoed
sybil
especially
in
a
place
like
this
where
nothing
ever
happens
if
i
wanted
to
write
a
novel
i
should
go
to
spain
or
siberia
or
the
rocky
mountains
where
things
do
happen
according
to
all
accounts
young
lady
returned
the
novelist
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
i
had
exactly
the
same
notion
when
i
first
began
and
i
remember
what
a
much
older
hand
said
to
me
when
i
told
him
i
was
going
down
to
cornwall
for
romantic
background
man
said
he
you
placed
a
romance
in
your
mother
backyard
yet
i
had
not
but
i
did
so
at
once
instead
of
going
to
cornwall
and
sounder
advice
i
never
had
in
my
life
material
like
charity
begins
at
home
nor
need
you
suppose
that
nothing
ever
happens
down
here
that
is
the
universal
idea
of
the
native
about
his
or
her
own
heath
but
i
can
assure
you
it
is
the
case
at
all
only
just
now
on
my
way
here
i
saw
a
scene
and
a
character
that
might
have
been
lifted
bodily
out
of
bret
harte
sybil
venables
clamored
for
particulars
while
her
sister
resigned
herself
to
further
weariness
of
the
flesh
rachel
put
down
her
cup
and
leant
forward
with
curiously
expectant
eyes
they
were
sitting
in
the
cool
square
hall
with
doors
shut
or
open
upon
every
hand
and
the
gilded
gallery
overhead
statuettes
and
ferns
all
reflected
in
the
highly
polished
marble
floor
added
a
theatrical
touch
which
was
not
out
of
keeping
with
a
somewhat
ornate
interior
it
was
the
character
continued
langholm
who
was
making
the
scene
and
a
stranger
creature
i
have
never
seen
on
english
earth
he
wore
what
i
believe
they
call
a
crimean
shirt
and
a
hat
like
a
stage
cowboy
and
he
informed
all
passers
that
he
was
knocking
down
his
check
what
cried
rachel
and
sybil
in
one
breath
but
in
curiously
different
tones
knocking
down
his
check
repeated
langholm
it
what
they
do
in
the
far
west
or
the
bush
or
somewhere
but
i
rather
fancy
it
the
bush
when
they
get
arrears
of
wages
in
a
lump
in
one
check
and
where
did
you
see
all
this
inquired
rachel
whose
voice
was
very
quiet
but
her
hazel
eyes
alight
with
a
deeper
interest
than
the
story
warranted
at
the
packhorse
on
the
york
road
i
came
that
way
round
for
the
sake
of
the
surface
and
the
exercise
and
did
you
see
the
check
no
i
only
stopped
for
a
moment
to
find
out
what
the
excitement
was
about
but
the
fellow
i
can
see
now
you
never
set
eyes
on
such
a
pirate
gloriously
drunk
and
bearded
to
the
belt
i
did
stop
because
he
was
lacing
into
everybody
with
a
cushion
and
the
local
loafers
seemed
to
like
it
what
a
joke
cried
sybil
venables
there
is
no
accounting
for
taste
remarked
her
sapient
sister
and
he
was
belaboring
them
with
a
cushion
did
you
say
added
rachel
with
the
slightest
emphasis
upon
the
noun
well
it
looked
like
one
to
me
replied
langholm
but
on
second
thoughts
it
was
more
like
a
bolster
in
shape
and
now
i
know
what
it
was
it
has
just
dawned
on
me
it
looked
like
a
bolster
done
up
in
a
blanket
but
it
was
the
swag
that
the
tramps
carry
in
australia
with
all
their
earthly
goods
rolled
up
in
their
bedding
and
the
fellow
was
an
australian
swagsman
that
what
he
was
swagman
corrected
rachel
instinctively
and
pray
what
color
was
the
blanket
she
made
haste
to
add
faded
blue
and
again
from
sheer
force
of
instinct
rachel
gave
a
nod
were
you
ever
out
there
mrs
steel
inquired
langholm
carelessly
i
never
was
but
the
sort
of
thing
has
been
done
to
death
in
books
and
i
only
wonder
i
did
recognize
it
at
once
well
it
was
the
last
type
one
thought
to
meet
with
in
broad
daylight
on
an
english
country
road
had
langholm
realized
that
he
had
put
a
question
which
he
had
no
business
to
put
had
he
convicted
himself
of
a
direct
though
unpremeditated
attempt
to
probe
the
mystery
of
his
antecedents
and
were
his
subsequent
observations
designed
to
unsay
that
question
in
effect
if
so
there
was
no
such
delicacy
in
the
elder
miss
venables
who
became
quite
animated
at
the
sudden
change
in
rachel
face
and
at
her
own
perception
of
the
cause
have
you
been
to
australia
mrs
steel
repeated
vera
looking
rachel
full
in
the
eyes
and
she
added
slyly
i
believe
you
have
there
was
a
moment
pause
and
then
a
crisp
step
rang
upon
the
marble
as
steel
emerged
from
his
study
australia
my
dear
miss
venables
said
he
is
the
one
country
that
neither
my
wife
nor
i
have
ever
visited
in
our
lives
and
the
last
one
that
either
of
us
has
the
least
curiosity
to
see
and
he
took
his
seat
among
them
with
a
smile
chapter
xiii
the
australian
room
it
was
that
discomfort
to
man
that
cruelty
to
beast
that
outrage
by
unnatural
nature
upon
all
her
children
a
bitter
summer
day
the
wind
was
in
the
east
great
swollen
clouds
wallowed
across
the
sky
now
without
a
drop
now
breaking
into
capricious
showers
of
stinging
rain
and
a
very
occasional
burst
of
sunlight
served
only
to
emphasize
the
evil
by
reminding
one
of
the
season
it
really
was
or
should
have
been
even
if
it
did
not
entice
one
to
the
wetting
which
was
the
sure
reward
of
a
walk
abroad
the
delverton
air
was
strong
and
bracing
enough
but
the
patron
wind
of
the
district
bit
to
the
bone
through
garments
never
intended
for
winter
wear
on
such
a
day
there
could
be
few
more
undesirable
abodes
than
normanthorpe
house
with
its
marble
floors
its
high
ceilings
and
its
general
scheme
of
italian
coolness
and
discomfort
it
was
a
tuesday
when
steel
usually
amused
himself
by
going
on
in
northborough
and
lunching
there
at
the
delverton
club
rachel
was
thus
not
only
physically
chilled
and
depressed
but
thrown
upon
her
own
society
at
its
worst
and
she
missed
that
of
her
husband
more
than
she
was
aware
once
she
had
been
a
bright
and
energetic
person
with
plenty
of
resources
within
herself
now
she
had
singularly
few
she
was
distraught
and
uneasy
in
her
mind
could
settle
less
and
less
to
her
singing
or
a
book
and
was
the
victim
of
an
increasing
restlessness
of
mind
and
limb
others
did
not
see
it
she
had
but
repression
was
no
cure
and
for
all
this
there
were
reasons
enough
but
the
fear
of
identification
by
the
neighbors
as
the
notorious
minchin
was
no
longer
one
of
them
no
it
was
her
own
life
root
and
branch
that
had
grown
into
the
which
was
poisoning
existence
for
rachel
steel
she
was
being
punished
for
her
second
marriage
as
she
had
been
punished
for
her
first
only
more
deservedly
and
with
more
subtle
stripes
each
day
brought
a
dozen
tokens
of
the
anomalous
position
which
she
had
accepted
in
the
madness
of
an
hour
of
utter
recklessness
and
desperation
rachel
was
not
mistress
in
her
own
house
nor
did
she
feel
for
a
moment
that
it
was
her
own
house
at
all
everything
was
done
for
her
a
skilled
housekeeper
settled
the
smallest
details
and
that
these
were
perfect
alike
in
arrangement
and
execution
that
the
said
housekeeper
was
a
woman
of
irreproachable
tact
and
capability
and
that
she
herself
had
never
an
excuse
for
concrete
complaint
formed
a
growing
though
intangible
grievance
in
rachel
mind
she
had
not
felt
it
at
first
she
had
changed
in
these
summer
months
she
wanted
to
be
more
like
other
wives
there
was
morna
woodgate
with
the
work
cut
out
for
every
hour
of
her
full
and
happy
days
but
morna
had
not
made
an
anomalous
marriage
morna
had
married
for
love
and
there
was
not
even
morna
to
come
and
see
her
or
for
her
to
go
and
see
for
tuesday
afternoon
was
not
one
of
the
few
upon
which
the
vicar
wife
had
no
settled
duty
or
occupation
in
the
parish
rachel
so
envied
her
the
way
in
which
she
helped
her
husband
in
his
work
she
had
tried
to
help
also
in
a
desultory
way
but
it
is
one
thing
to
do
a
thing
because
it
is
a
duty
and
another
thing
to
do
it
for
something
to
do
as
rachel
soon
found
out
besides
hugh
woodgate
was
not
her
husband
rachel
had
the
right
feeling
to
abandon
those
attempts
at
personal
recreation
in
the
guise
of
good
works
and
the
courage
to
give
morna
her
reasons
but
she
almost
regretted
it
this
afternoon
she
had
explored
for
the
twentieth
time
that
strange
treasury
known
as
the
chinese
room
a
state
apartment
filled
with
loot
brought
home
from
the
flowery
land
by
a
naval
scion
of
the
house
of
normanthorpe
and
somewhat
cynically
included
in
the
sale
the
idols
only
leered
in
rachel
face
and
the
cabinets
of
grotesque
design
were
unprovided
with
any
key
to
their
history
of
former
uses
in
sheer
desperation
rachel
betook
herself
to
her
husband
study
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
crossed
that
threshold
in
his
absence
but
within
were
the
books
and
a
book
she
must
have
these
also
had
been
purchased
with
the
house
with
few
exceptions
they
were
ancient
books
in
battered
calf
which
steel
had
stigmatized
as
musty
trash
once
when
rachel
had
asked
him
if
she
might
take
one
she
had
not
made
that
request
again
indeed
it
was
seldom
enough
that
she
had
set
foot
inside
the
spacious
room
which
the
old
books
lined
and
in
which
the
master
of
the
house
disliked
being
disturbed
yet
it
was
anything
but
trash
which
she
now
discovered
upon
the
dusty
shelves
there
was
in
four
volumes
and
the
in
eight
and
the
works
of
swift
all
with
the
long
s
and
backs
like
polished
oak
in
the
lower
shelves
were
hogarth
and
gillray
in
rare
folios
at
every
level
and
on
either
hand
were
books
worth
taking
out
but
this
was
almost
all
that
rachel
did
she
took
them
out
and
put
them
in
again
for
that
was
her
unsettled
mood
she
spent
some
minutes
over
the
swifts
but
not
sufficiently
attracted
to
march
off
with
them
the
quaint
obsolete
type
of
the
various
volumes
attracted
her
more
as
a
curiosity
than
as
readable
print
the
coarse
satires
of
the
early
masters
of
caricature
and
cartoon
did
not
attract
her
at
all
upbringing
had
deprived
her
of
the
traditions
the
superstitions
and
the
shibboleths
which
are
at
once
a
strength
and
a
weakness
of
the
ordinary
english
education
if
however
she
was
too
much
inclined
to
take
a
world
masterpiece
exactly
as
she
found
it
her
taste
such
as
it
was
at
all
events
was
her
own
she
had
naturally
an
open
mind
but
it
was
not
open
now
it
was
full
and
running
over
with
the
mysteries
and
the
perplexities
of
her
own
environment
books
would
not
take
her
out
of
herself
in
them
she
could
not
hope
to
find
a
key
to
any
one
of
the
problems
within
problems
which
beset
and
tortured
her
so
she
ran
her
hand
along
the
dusty
books
little
dreaming
that
the
key
was
there
all
the
time
so
in
the
end
and
quite
by
chance
but
for
the
fact
that
she
was
dipping
into
so
many
she
took
out
the
right
book
and
started
backward
with
it
in
her
hand
the
book
was
faerie
and
rachel
had
extracted
it
in
a
gothic
spirit
because
she
had
once
heard
that
very
few
living
persons
had
read
it
from
end
to
end
since
she
could
not
become
interested
in
anything
she
might
as
well
be
thoroughly
bored
but
she
never
opened
the
volume
for
in
the
dark
slit
which
it
left
something
shone
like
a
little
new
moon
rachel
put
in
her
hand
and
felt
a
small
brass
handle
to
turn
and
pull
it
was
the
work
of
her
hand
without
a
guiding
thought
but
when
tiers
of
books
swung
towards
her
with
the
opening
door
which
they
hid
it
was
not
in
human
nature
to
shut
that
door
again
without
so
much
as
peeping
in
rachel
first
peeped
then
stepped
into
a
secret
chamber
as
disappointing
at
the
first
glance
as
such
a
place
could
possibly
be
it
was
deep
in
dust
and
filled
with
not
half
unpacked
a
and
nothing
more
the
door
swung
to
with
a
click
behind
her
as
rachel
stood
in
the
midst
of
this
uninteresting
litter
and
instinctively
she
turned
round
that
instant
she
stood
rooted
to
the
ground
her
eyes
staring
her
chin
fallen
a
dreadful
fear
in
every
feature
of
her
face
it
was
not
that
her
second
husband
had
followed
and
discovered
her
it
was
the
face
of
her
first
husband
that
looked
upon
rachel
steel
his
bold
eyes
staring
into
hers
through
the
broken
glass
of
a
behind
the
door
the
portrait
was
not
hanging
from
the
wall
but
resting
against
it
on
the
floor
it
was
a
photographic
enlargement
in
colors
and
the
tinted
eyes
looked
up
at
rachel
with
all
the
bold
assurance
that
she
remembered
so
keenly
in
the
perished
flesh
she
had
not
an
instant
doubt
about
those
eyes
they
spoke
in
a
way
that
made
her
shiver
and
yet
the
photograph
was
that
of
a
much
younger
man
than
she
had
married
it
was
alexander
minchin
with
whiskers
his
hair
parted
in
the
middle
and
the
kind
of
pin
in
the
kind
of
tie
which
had
been
practically
obsolete
for
years
it
was
none
the
less
indubitably
and
indisputably
alexander
minchin
and
indeed
that
fact
alone
was
enough
to
shake
rachel
nerves
her
discovery
had
all
the
shock
of
an
unwelcome
encounter
with
the
living
but
it
was
the
gradual
appreciation
of
the
true
significance
of
her
discovery
that
redoubled
rachel
qualms
even
as
she
was
beginning
to
get
the
better
of
them
so
they
had
been
friends
her
first
husband
and
her
second
rachel
stooped
and
looked
hard
at
the
enlargement
and
there
sure
enough
was
the
photographer
imprint
yes
they
had
been
friends
in
australia
that
country
which
john
buchanan
steel
elaborately
and
repeatedly
pretended
never
to
have
visited
in
all
his
travels
rachel
could
have
smiled
as
she
drew
herself
up
with
this
point
settled
in
her
mind
for
ever
why
the
room
reeked
of
australia
these
cases
had
never
been
properly
unpacked
they
were
overflowing
with
memorials
of
the
life
which
she
herself
knew
so
well
here
a
sheaf
of
boomerangs
were
peeping
out
there
was
an
old
gray
with
a
coiled
above
the
brim
that
was
an
australian
saddle
and
those
glass
cases
contained
samples
of
merino
wool
so
it
was
in
australia
as
a
squatter
that
steel
had
made
his
fortune
but
why
suppress
a
fact
so
free
from
all
discredit
these
were
just
the
relics
of
a
bush
life
which
a
departing
colonist
might
care
to
bring
home
with
him
to
the
old
country
then
why
cast
them
into
a
secret
whose
very
existence
was
unknown
to
the
old
australian
australian
wife
rachel
felt
her
brain
reeling
and
yet
she
was
thankful
for
the
light
which
had
been
vouchsafed
to
her
at
last
it
was
but
a
lantern
flash
through
the
darkness
which
seemed
the
more
opaque
for
that
one
thin
beam
of
light
but
it
was
something
a
beginning
a
clew
for
the
rest
she
was
going
straight
to
the
man
who
had
kept
her
so
long
in
such
unnecessary
ignorance
why
had
he
not
told
her
about
australia
at
all
events
what
conceivable
harm
could
that
have
done
it
would
have
been
the
strongest
possible
bond
between
them
but
rachel
went
further
as
she
thought
more
why
not
have
told
her
frankly
that
he
had
known
alexander
minchin
years
before
she
did
herself
it
could
have
made
no
difference
after
alexander
minchin
death
then
why
had
he
kept
the
fact
so
jealously
to
himself
and
the
dead
man
painted
eyes
answered
why
with
the
bold
and
mocking
stare
his
wife
could
not
forget
a
stare
which
at
that
moment
assumed
a
new
and
sinister
significance
in
her
sight
rachel
looked
upward
through
the
window
which
was
barred
and
almost
totally
eclipsed
by
shrubs
but
a
clout
of
sky
was
just
visible
under
the
architrave
it
was
a
very
gray
sky
gray
also
was
rachel
face
in
the
sudden
grip
of
horror
and
surmise
then
a
ragged
edge
of
cloud
caught
golden
fire
a
glimmer
found
its
way
into
the
dust
and
dirt
of
the
secret
chamber
and
rachel
relaxed
with
a
slight
smile
but
an
exceedingly
decided
shake
of
the
head
thereafter
she
escaped
incontinently
but
successfully
as
she
had
entered
closed
the
hidden
door
behind
her
and
restored
faerie
very
carefully
to
its
place
rachel
no
longer
proposed
to
join
the
select
band
of
those
who
have
read
that
epic
through
chapter
xiv
battle
royal
she
went
to
her
own
rooms
to
think
and
to
decide
and
what
she
first
thought
and
then
decided
was
sensible
enough
she
was
thankful
she
had
not
been
caught
like
fatima
in
the
forbidden
room
not
that
she
lacked
the
courage
to
meet
the
consequences
of
her
acts
but
it
would
have
put
her
in
the
wrong
and
at
a
disadvantage
at
the
first
crash
of
battle
and
a
battle
royal
rachel
quite
expected
nor
had
she
the
faintest
intention
of
disguising
what
she
had
done
but
it
was
her
husband
who
was
to
be
taken
aback
for
a
change
the
steels
dined
alone
as
usual
or
as
much
alone
as
a
man
and
his
wife
with
a
butler
and
two
footmen
are
permitted
to
be
at
their
meals
steel
was
at
his
best
after
these
jaunts
of
his
to
northborough
and
the
club
he
would
come
home
with
the
latest
news
from
that
centre
of
the
universe
the
latest
gossip
which
had
gone
the
rounds
on
and
at
lunch
the
newest
stories
of
venables
and
his
friends
which
were
invariably
reproduced
for
rachel
benefit
with
that
slight
but
unmistakable
local
accent
of
which
these
gentry
were
themselves
all
unconscious
steel
had
a
wicked
wit
and
rachel
as
a
rule
a
sufficiently
appreciative
smile
but
this
was
either
lacking
altogether
or
of
an
unconvincing
character
rachel
could
never
pretend
and
her
first
spontaneous
remark
was
when
her
glass
filled
up
with
froth
champagne
said
she
for
they
seldom
drank
it
it
has
been
such
a
wretched
day
explained
steel
that
i
ordered
it
medicinally
i
am
afraid
it
must
have
been
perishing
here
as
it
was
in
the
town
this
is
to
restore
your
circulation
my
circulation
is
all
right
answered
rachel
too
honest
even
to
smile
upon
the
man
with
whom
she
was
going
to
war
i
felt
cold
all
the
morning
but
i
have
been
warm
enough
since
the
afternoon
and
that
was
very
true
for
excitement
had
made
her
blood
run
hot
in
every
vein
nor
had
rachel
often
been
more
handsome
or
less
lovely
than
she
was
with
her
firm
lip
and
her
brooding
eye
there
was
another
reason
for
the
champagne
resumed
her
husband
very
frankly
for
him
when
at
last
they
had
the
to
themselves
i
am
in
disgrace
with
you
i
believe
and
i
want
to
hear
from
you
what
i
have
done
it
is
what
you
have
not
done
returned
rachel
as
she
stood
imperiously
before
the
lighted
fire
and
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
white
as
the
ornate
mantelpiece
of
carrara
marble
which
gleamed
behind
her
and
what
may
i
ask
is
my
latest
sin
of
omission
rachel
rushed
to
the
point
with
a
passionate
directness
that
did
her
no
discredit
why
have
you
pretended
all
these
months
that
you
never
were
in
australia
in
your
life
why
did
you
never
tell
me
that
you
knew
alexander
minchin
out
there
and
she
held
her
breath
against
the
worst
that
he
could
do
being
well
prepared
for
him
to
lose
first
his
color
and
then
the
temper
which
he
had
never
lost
since
she
had
known
him
to
fly
into
a
fury
to
curse
her
up
hill
and
down
dale
in
a
word
to
behave
as
her
first
husband
had
done
more
than
once
but
this
one
never
what
rachel
did
not
anticipate
was
a
smile
that
cloaked
not
a
single
particle
of
surprise
and
the
little
cocksure
bow
that
accompanied
the
smile
so
you
have
found
it
out
said
steel
and
his
smile
only
ended
as
he
sipped
his
coffee
even
then
there
was
no
end
to
it
in
his
eyes
this
afternoon
said
rachel
disconcerted
but
not
undone
by
poking
your
nose
into
places
which
you
would
not
think
of
approaching
in
my
presence
by
the
merest
accident
in
the
world
and
rachel
described
the
accident
truth
flashing
from
her
eyes
in
an
instant
her
husband
face
changed
the
smile
went
out
but
it
was
no
frown
that
came
in
its
stead
i
beg
your
pardon
rachel
said
he
earnestly
i
suppose
he
added
that
a
man
may
call
his
wife
by
her
christian
name
for
once
in
a
way
i
did
so
however
without
thinking
and
because
i
really
do
most
humbly
beg
your
pardon
for
an
injustice
which
i
have
done
you
for
some
hours
in
my
own
mind
i
came
home
between
three
and
four
and
i
heard
you
were
in
my
study
you
were
not
but
that
book
was
out
and
then
of
course
i
knew
where
you
were
my
hand
was
on
the
knob
but
i
drew
it
back
i
wondered
if
you
would
have
the
pluck
to
do
the
tackling
and
i
apologize
again
steel
concluded
for
i
knew
you
quite
well
enough
to
have
also
known
that
at
least
there
was
no
question
about
your
courage
then
said
rachel
impulsively
after
having
made
up
her
mind
to
ignore
these
compliments
then
i
think
you
might
at
least
be
candid
with
me
and
am
i
not
he
cried
have
i
denied
that
the
portrait
you
saw
is
indeed
the
portrait
of
alexander
minchin
and
yet
how
easy
that
would
have
been
it
was
taken
long
before
you
knew
him
he
must
have
altered
considerably
after
that
or
i
might
have
known
him
under
another
name
but
no
i
tell
you
honestly
that
your
first
husband
was
a
very
dear
friend
of
mine
more
years
ago
than
i
care
to
reckon
did
you
hear
me
he
added
with
one
of
his
sudden
changes
of
tone
and
manner
a
very
dear
friend
i
said
for
that
he
undoubtedly
was
but
was
i
going
to
ask
you
to
marry
a
very
dear
friend
of
the
man
who
deteriorated
so
terribly
and
who
treated
you
so
ill
delivered
in
the
most
natural
manner
imaginable
with
the
quiet
confidence
of
which
this
man
was
full
and
followed
by
a
smile
of
conscious
yet
not
unkindly
triumph
this
argument
like
most
that
fell
from
his
lips
upon
her
ears
was
invested
with
a
value
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
real
worth
and
steel
clinched
it
with
one
of
those
homely
saws
which
are
not
disdained
by
makers
of
speeches
the
wide
world
over
could
you
really
think
he
added
with
one
of
his
rarest
and
most
winning
smiles
that
i
should
be
such
a
fool
as
to
invite
you
to
step
out
of
the
into
the
fire
rachel
felt
for
a
moment
that
she
would
like
to
say
it
was
exactly
what
she
had
done
but
even
in
that
moment
she
perceived
that
such
a
statement
would
have
been
very
far
from
the
truth
and
her
nature
was
large
enough
to
refrain
from
the
momentary
gratification
of
a
bitter
repartee
but
he
was
too
clever
for
her
that
she
did
feel
whatever
else
he
might
be
and
her
only
chance
was
to
return
to
the
plain
questions
with
which
she
had
started
demanding
answers
as
plain
rachel
led
up
to
them
however
with
one
or
two
of
which
she
already
knew
the
answer
thus
preparing
for
her
spring
in
quite
the
old
bailey
manner
which
she
had
mastered
subconsciously
at
her
trial
and
which
for
once
was
to
profit
a
prisoner
at
the
bar
yet
you
do
any
longer
deny
that
you
have
been
to
australia
it
is
useless
i
lived
there
for
years
and
you
admit
that
you
knew
alexander
quite
well
out
there
most
intimately
in
the
riverina
some
fifteen
or
twenty
years
ago
he
was
on
my
station
as
almost
everything
a
gentleman
could
be
up
to
overseer
and
by
that
time
he
was
half
a
son
to
me
and
half
a
younger
brother
but
no
relation
as
a
matter
of
fact
none
whatever
but
my
very
familiar
friend
as
i
have
already
told
you
then
why
in
the
world
rachel
almost
thundered
could
you
not
tell
me
so
in
the
beginning
that
is
a
question
i
have
already
answered
then
i
have
another
why
so
often
and
so
systematically
pretend
that
you
never
were
in
australia
at
all
that
is
a
question
which
i
implore
you
not
to
press
the
two
answers
so
like
each
other
in
verbal
form
were
utterly
dissimilar
in
the
manner
of
their
utterance
suddenly
and
for
the
first
time
in
all
her
knowledge
of
him
his
cynical
aplomb
had
fallen
from
the
man
like
a
garment
one
moment
he
was
brazening
past
deceit
with
a
smiling
face
the
next
he
was
in
earnest
even
he
and
that
mocking
voice
vibrated
with
deep
feeling
i
should
have
thought
all
the
more
of
you
for
being
an
australian
continued
rachel
vaguely
touched
at
the
change
in
him
i
who
am
proud
of
being
one
myself
what
harm
could
it
have
done
my
knowing
that
you
are
not
the
only
one
from
whom
i
have
hidden
it
said
steel
still
in
a
low
and
altered
voice
yet
you
brought
home
all
those
keepsakes
of
the
bush
but
i
thought
better
of
them
and
have
never
even
unpacked
them
all
as
you
must
have
seen
for
yourself
yet
your
mysterious
visitor
of
the
other
day
another
australian
of
course
indeed
another
man
who
worked
upon
my
own
run
and
he
knows
why
you
do
want
it
known
over
here
he
does
said
steel
with
grim
brevity
rachel
moved
forward
and
pressed
his
hand
impulsively
to
her
surprise
the
pressure
was
returned
that
instant
their
hands
fell
apart
i
beg
your
pardon
in
my
turn
she
said
i
can
only
promise
you
that
i
will
never
again
reopen
that
wound
whatever
it
may
be
and
i
wo
even
try
to
guess
i
undertook
not
to
try
to
probe
your
past
and
i
will
keep
my
undertaking
in
the
main
but
where
it
impinges
upon
my
own
past
i
simply
can
not
you
say
you
were
my
first
husband
close
friend
added
rachel
looking
her
second
husband
more
squarely
than
ever
in
the
eyes
was
that
what
brought
you
to
my
trial
for
his
murder
he
returned
her
look
it
was
was
that
what
made
you
wish
to
marry
me
yourself
no
answer
but
his
assurance
coming
back
as
he
stood
looking
at
her
under
beetling
eyebrows
over
black
arms
folded
across
a
snowy
shirt
it
was
the
wrong
moment
for
the
old
adam
return
for
rachel
had
reached
the
point
upon
which
she
most
passionately
desired
enlightenment
i
want
to
know
she
cried
and
i
insist
on
knowing
what
first
put
it
into
your
head
or
your
heart
to
marry
me
all
but
convicted
steel
held
up
his
hand
glancing
in
apprehension
towards
the
door
i
have
told
you
so
often
he
said
and
your
glass
tells
you
whenever
you
look
into
it
i
sat
within
a
few
feet
of
you
for
the
inside
of
a
week
but
that
is
not
true
she
told
him
quietly
trust
a
woman
to
know
if
it
were
in
the
white
glare
of
the
electric
light
he
seemed
for
once
to
change
color
slightly
if
you
will
not
accept
my
word
he
answered
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
and
he
switched
off
a
bunch
of
the
lights
that
had
beaten
too
fiercely
upon
him
but
it
only
looked
as
if
he
was
about
to
end
the
interview
you
have
admitted
so
many
untruths
in
the
last
half
hour
pursued
rachel
in
a
thrilling
voice
that
you
ought
not
to
be
hurt
if
i
suspect
you
of
another
come
can
you
look
me
in
the
face
and
tell
me
that
you
married
me
for
love
no
you
turn
away
because
you
can
not
then
will
you
in
god
name
tell
me
why
you
did
marry
me
and
she
followed
him
with
clasped
hands
her
beautiful
eyes
filled
with
tears
her
white
throat
quivering
with
sobs
until
suddenly
he
turned
upon
her
as
though
in
no
i
will
not
he
cried
since
the
answer
i
have
given
you
and
the
obvious
answer
is
not
good
enough
for
you
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
find
out
for
yourself
a
truculent
look
came
into
rachel
eyes
as
they
rested
upon
the
smooth
face
so
unusually
agitated
beneath
the
smooth
silvery
hair
i
will
she
answered
through
her
teeth
i
shall
take
you
at
your
word
and
find
out
for
myself
i
will
and
she
swept
past
him
out
of
the
room
illustration
i
will
she
answered
through
her
teeth
and
she
swept
past
him
out
of
the
room
chapter
xv
a
chance
encounter
there
was
now
an
open
breach
between
the
steels
but
no
third
person
would
have
discerned
any
difference
in
their
relations
it
was
a
mere
snapping
of
the
threads
across
the
chasm
which
had
always
separated
rachel
from
her
second
husband
the
chasm
had
been
plain
enough
to
those
who
came
much
in
contact
with
the
pair
but
the
little
threads
of
sympathy
were
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
of
ordinary
observation
there
was
thus
no
outward
change
for
neither
was
there
any
outward
rupture
it
takes
two
to
quarrel
and
steel
imperturbably
refused
to
make
one
rachel
might
be
as
trying
as
she
pleased
no
repulse
depressed
no
caprice
annoyed
him
and
this
insensibility
was
not
the
least
of
offences
in
the
now
jaundiced
eyes
of
his
wife
rachel
felt
as
bitter
as
one
only
does
against
those
who
have
inspired
some
softer
feeling
the
poison
of
misplaced
confidence
rankled
in
her
blood
her
husband
had
told
her
much
but
it
was
not
enough
for
rachel
and
the
little
he
refused
to
tell
eliminated
all
the
rest
from
her
mind
there
was
no
merit
even
in
such
frankness
as
he
had
shown
since
her
own
accidental
discoveries
had
forced
some
measure
of
honesty
upon
him
he
had
admitted
nothing
which
rachel
could
not
have
deduced
from
that
which
she
had
found
out
for
herself
she
felt
as
far
as
ever
from
any
satisfactory
clew
to
his
mysterious
reasons
for
ever
wishing
to
marry
her
there
lay
the
kernel
of
the
whole
matter
there
the
problem
that
she
meant
to
solve
if
her
first
husband
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
no
matter
how
indirectly
and
if
she
had
been
married
for
the
dead
sake
to
give
his
widow
a
home
then
rachel
felt
that
the
last
affront
had
been
put
upon
her
and
she
would
leave
this
man
as
she
had
been
within
an
ace
of
leaving
his
friend
so
ran
the
wild
and
unreasonable
tenor
of
her
thoughts
he
had
not
married
her
for
her
own
sake
it
was
not
she
herself
who
had
appealed
to
him
after
all
curiosity
might
consume
her
and
a
sense
of
deepening
mystery
add
terrors
of
its
own
but
the
resentful
feeling
was
stronger
than
either
of
these
and
would
have
afforded
as
strange
a
revelation
as
any
had
rachel
dared
to
look
deeper
into
her
own
heart
if
on
the
other
hand
she
had
already
some
conception
of
the
truth
about
herself
it
would
scarcely
lessen
her
bitterness
against
one
who
inspired
in
her
emotions
at
once
so
complex
and
so
painful
suffice
it
that
this
bitterness
was
extreme
in
the
days
immediately
following
the
scene
between
rachel
and
her
husband
in
the
after
dinner
it
was
also
unconcealed
and
must
have
been
the
cause
of
many
another
such
scene
but
for
the
imperturable
temper
and
the
singularly
ruly
tongue
of
john
buchanan
steel
and
then
in
those
same
days
there
fell
the
two
social
events
to
which
the
bidden
guests
had
been
looking
forward
for
some
two
or
three
weeks
and
of
which
the
whole
neighborhood
was
to
talk
for
years
on
the
tenth
of
august
the
uniackes
were
giving
a
great
garden
party
at
hornby
manor
while
the
eleventh
was
the
date
of
the
first
real
for
which
the
steels
had
issued
invitations
to
normanthorpe
house
the
tenth
was
an
ideal
august
day
deep
blue
sky
trees
still
untarnished
in
the
hardy
northern
air
and
black
shadows
under
the
trees
rachel
made
herself
ready
before
lunch
to
which
she
came
down
looking
quite
lovely
in
blue
as
joyous
as
the
sky
to
find
her
husband
as
fully
prepared
and
not
less
becomingly
attired
in
a
gray
without
a
ripple
on
its
surface
they
looked
critically
at
each
other
for
an
instant
and
then
steel
said
something
pleasant
to
which
rachel
made
practically
no
reply
they
ate
their
lunch
in
a
silence
broken
at
intervals
from
one
end
of
the
table
only
then
the
woodgates
arrived
to
drive
with
them
to
hornby
which
was
some
seven
or
eight
miles
away
and
the
normanthorpe
landau
and
pair
started
with
the
quartette
shortly
after
three
morning
noon
and
afternoon
of
this
same
tenth
of
august
charles
langholm
the
minor
novelist
never
lifted
his
unkempt
head
from
the
old
bureau
at
which
he
worked
beside
an
open
window
overlooking
his
cottage
garden
a
tumbler
of
his
beloved
roses
stood
in
one
corner
of
the
writing
space
up
to
the
cuts
in
and
roses
still
ungathered
peeped
above
the
and
drooped
from
either
side
but
langholm
had
a
soul
far
below
roses
at
the
present
moment
his
neatly
numbered
sheets
of
ruled
were
nearing
the
five
hundredth
page
his
hero
and
his
heroine
were
in
the
full
sweep
of
those
emotional
explanations
which
they
had
ingeniously
avoided
for
the
last
three
hundred
at
least
in
a
word
charles
langholm
new
novel
is
being
finished
while
you
wait
it
is
not
one
of
his
best
yet
a
moment
ago
there
was
a
tear
in
his
eye
and
now
he
is
grinning
like
a
child
at
play
and
at
play
he
is
though
he
be
paid
for
playing
and
though
the
game
is
only
being
won
after
weeks
and
months
of
uphill
labor
and
downhill
joy
at
last
there
is
the
final
ticking
of
inverted
commas
and
charles
langholm
inscribes
the
autograph
for
which
he
is
importuned
once
in
a
blue
moon
and
which
the
printer
will
certainly
not
set
up
at
the
foot
of
the
last
page
but
the
thing
is
done
and
the
doer
must
needs
set
his
hand
to
it
out
of
pure
and
unusual
satisfaction
with
himself
and
so
thank
the
lord
langholm
rose
stiffly
from
the
old
bureau
where
at
his
best
he
could
lose
all
sense
of
time
for
the
moment
he
was
bent
double
and
faint
with
fasting
because
it
was
his
mischievous
rule
to
reach
a
given
point
before
submitting
to
the
physical
and
mental
distraction
of
a
meal
but
given
point
had
been
the
end
of
his
book
and
for
some
happy
minutes
langholm
fed
on
his
elation
it
was
done
at
last
yet
another
novel
and
not
such
a
bad
one
after
all
not
his
best
by
any
means
but
perhaps
still
further
from
being
his
worst
and
at
all
events
the
thing
was
done
langholm
could
scarcely
grasp
that
fact
though
there
was
the
last
page
just
dry
upon
the
bureau
and
most
of
the
rest
lying
about
the
room
in
or
in
typewritten
sheets
moreover
the
publishers
were
pleased
that
was
the
joke
it
was
nothing
less
to
langholm
when
he
reflected
that
the
final
stimulus
to
finish
this
book
had
been
the
prospect
and
determination
of
at
last
writing
one
to
please
himself
and
this
reflection
brought
him
down
from
his
rosy
clouds
it
was
the
day
of
the
uniacke
they
had
actually
asked
the
poor
author
and
the
poor
author
had
intended
to
go
not
that
he
either
shone
or
revelled
in
society
but
steel
would
be
there
and
he
burned
to
tell
her
that
he
had
finished
his
book
and
was
at
last
free
to
tackle
hers
for
hers
at
bottom
it
would
be
the
great
novel
by
which
the
name
of
langholm
was
to
live
and
which
he
was
to
found
by
rachel
steel
advice
upon
the
case
of
her
namesake
rachel
minchin
the
coincidence
of
the
christian
names
had
naturally
struck
the
novelist
but
no
suspicion
of
the
truth
had
crossed
a
mind
too
skilled
in
the
construction
of
dramatic
situations
to
dream
of
stumbling
into
one
it
was
thus
with
a
heart
as
light
as
any
feather
that
langholm
made
a
rapid
and
unwholesome
meal
followed
by
a
deliberate
and
painstaking
toilet
after
which
he
proceeded
at
a
prudent
pace
upon
his
bicycle
to
hornby
manor
flags
were
drooping
from
their
poles
a
band
clashing
fitfully
through
the
sleepy
august
air
and
carriages
still
sweeping
into
the
long
drive
when
langholm
also
made
his
humble
advent
he
was
a
little
uneasy
and
and
annoyed
at
his
own
anxiety
to
impart
his
tidings
to
steel
but
for
whom
he
would
probably
have
stayed
at
home
his
eye
sought
her
eagerly
as
he
set
foot
upon
the
lawn
having
left
his
bicycle
at
the
stables
and
carefully
removed
the
clips
from
his
trousers
but
before
his
vigilance
could
be
rewarded
he
was
despatched
by
his
hostess
to
the
in
charge
of
a
very
young
lady
detached
for
the
nonce
from
the
wing
of
a
gaunt
old
gentleman
with
side
whiskers
and
lantern
jaws
fresh
from
his
fagging
task
langholm
did
not
know
what
on
earth
to
say
to
the
pretty
schoolgirl
whose
own
shyness
reacted
on
herself
but
he
was
doing
his
best
and
atoning
in
attentiveness
for
his
shortcomings
as
a
companion
when
in
the
tent
he
had
to
apologize
to
a
lady
in
blue
who
turned
out
to
be
rachel
herself
with
hugh
woodgate
at
her
side
oh
no
we
live
in
london
the
young
girl
was
saying
only
i
go
to
the
same
school
as
ida
uniacke
and
i
am
staying
here
on
a
visit
i
finished
it
whispered
langholm
to
rachel
this
very
afternoon
and
now
i
ready
for
yours
i
see
he
added
dropping
back
into
the
attitude
of
respectful
interest
in
the
young
girl
only
on
a
visit
and
who
was
the
old
gentleman
from
whom
i
tore
you
away
the
child
laughed
merrily
that
was
my
father
she
said
but
he
is
only
here
on
his
way
to
leeds
you
must
call
it
my
book
remonstrated
rachel
while
woodgate
waited
upon
both
ladies
but
it
was
you
who
gave
me
the
idea
of
writing
a
novel
round
mrs
minchin
i
do
think
i
did
i
am
quite
sure
it
was
your
own
idea
but
one
book
at
a
time
surely
you
will
take
a
rest
i
shall
correct
this
thing
it
will
depress
me
to
the
verge
of
suicide
then
i
shall
fall
to
upon
my
you
really
think
it
will
be
that
it
should
be
mine
it
is
saying
much
but
i
never
had
such
a
plot
as
you
have
given
me
rachel
shook
her
head
in
a
last
disclaimer
as
she
moved
away
with
the
vicar
of
marley
oh
langholm
do
you
write
books
asked
the
schoolgirl
with
round
blue
eyes
for
my
sins
he
confessed
but
do
you
prefer
an
ice
or
more
strawberries
and
cream
neither
thank
you
i
been
here
before
the
young
girl
said
with
a
jolly
smile
but
i
did
know
i
should
come
back
with
an
author
then
we
go
out
into
the
open
air
the
author
said
and
they
followed
rachel
at
but
a
few
yards
distance
it
was
a
picturesque
if
an
aimless
pageant
the
smart
frocks
sweeping
the
smooth
sward
the
pretty
parasols
with
the
prettier
faces
underneath
the
and
men
with
the
old
gray
manor
rising
upon
an
eminence
in
the
background
and
a
dazzling
splash
of
scarlet
and
of
brass
somewhere
under
the
trees
the
band
was
playing
selections
from
as
langholm
emerged
from
the
in
rachel
wake
venables
was
manoeuvring
her
two
highly
marriageable
girls
in
opposite
quarters
of
the
field
and
had
only
her
own
indefatigable
generalship
to
thank
for
what
it
lost
her
upon
this
occasion
steel
and
woodgate
apparently
missed
the
same
thing
through
wandering
idly
in
the
direction
of
the
band
but
the
tableau
might
have
been
arranged
for
the
express
benefit
of
charles
langholm
and
the
very
young
lady
upon
whom
he
was
dancing
laborious
attendance
uniacke
had
stepped
apart
from
the
tall
old
gentleman
with
the
side
whiskers
to
whom
she
had
been
talking
for
some
time
and
had
intercepted
rachel
as
she
was
passing
on
with
hugh
woodgate
wait
while
i
introduce
you
to
my
most
distinguished
guest
or
rawther
him
to
you
whispered
uniacke
with
the
irish
brogue
which
rendered
her
slightest
observation
a
delight
to
the
appreciative
sir
baldwin
gibson
mrs
steel
langholm
and
the
little
miss
gibson
were
standing
close
behind
and
the
trained
eye
of
the
habitual
observer
took
in
every
detail
of
a
scene
which
he
never
forgot
handsome
uniacke
was
clinching
the
introduction
with
a
smile
which
ended
in
a
swift
expression
of
surprise
sir
baldwin
had
made
an
extraordinary
pause
his
hand
half
way
to
his
hat
his
lantern
jaws
fallen
suddenly
apart
steel
though
slower
at
her
part
of
the
obvious
recognition
was
only
a
second
slower
and
thereupon
stood
abashed
and
ashamed
in
the
eyes
of
all
who
saw
but
only
for
another
second
at
the
most
then
sir
baldwin
gibson
not
only
raised
his
hat
but
held
out
his
hand
in
a
fatherly
way
and
as
she
took
it
rachel
color
changed
from
livid
white
to
ruby
red
yet
even
rachel
was
mistress
of
herself
so
quickly
that
the
one
or
two
of
this
scene
such
as
uniacke
and
charles
langholm
who
saw
that
it
had
a
serious
meaning
without
dreaming
what
that
meaning
was
were
each
in
hopes
that
no
one
else
had
seen
as
much
as
they
sir
baldwin
plunged
at
once
into
amiable
and
fluent
conversation
and
before
many
moments
rachel
replies
were
infected
with
an
approximate
assurance
and
ease
then
langholm
turned
to
his
juvenile
companion
and
put
a
question
in
the
form
of
a
fib
so
that
is
your
father
said
he
i
seem
do
you
know
to
know
his
face
little
miss
gibson
fell
an
easy
prey
you
probably
do
he
is
the
judge
you
know
the
judge
is
he
yes
and
i
wanted
to
ask
you
something
just
now
in
the
tent
did
you
mean
the
minchin
who
was
tried
for
murder
when
you
were
talking
about
your
plot
langholm
experienced
an
unforeseen
shock
from
head
to
heel
he
could
only
nod
he
was
the
judge
who
tried
her
the
schoolgirl
said
with
pardonable
pride
a
lady
joined
them
as
they
spoke
do
you
really
mean
that
that
is
justice
gibson
who
tried
minchin
at
the
old
bailey
last
november
yes
my
father
said
the
proud
young
girl
what
a
very
singular
thing
how
do
you
do
langholm
i
did
see
it
was
you
and
langholm
found
himself
shaking
hands
with
the
aquiline
lady
to
whom
he
had
talked
so
little
at
the
upthorpe
she
took
her
revenge
by
giving
him
only
the
tips
of
her
fingers
now
and
by
looking
deliberately
past
him
at
rachel
and
her
judge
chapter
xvi
a
match
for
venables
that
was
absolutely
all
that
happened
at
the
uniackes
there
was
no
scene
no
scandal
no
incident
whatsoever
beyond
an
apparently
mutual
recognition
between
steel
and
justice
gibson
of
this
there
were
not
witnesses
all
of
whom
were
given
immediate
reason
to
suppose
that
either
they
or
the
pair
in
question
had
made
a
mistake
for
nothing
could
have
surpassed
the
presence
of
mind
and
the
kindness
of
heart
with
which
sir
baldwin
gibson
chatted
to
the
woman
whom
he
had
tried
for
her
life
within
the
year
and
his
charity
continued
behind
her
back
odd
thing
said
sir
baldwin
to
his
hostess
at
the
earliest
opportunity
but
for
the
moment
i
could
have
sworn
that
woman
was
some
one
else
may
i
ask
who
she
is
exactly
sure
sir
baldwin
replied
uniacke
and
that
what
i
thought
we
were
to
hear
at
last
it
who
she
is
we
none
of
us
know
and
what
does
it
matter
she
pretty
and
nice
and
i
just
in
love
with
her
but
then
nobody
knows
any
more
about
her
husband
and
so
we
talk
a
few
more
questions
satisfied
the
judge
that
he
could
not
possibly
have
been
mistaken
and
he
hesitated
a
moment
for
he
was
a
pious
man
but
rachel
face
combined
with
her
nerve
had
deepended
an
impression
which
was
now
nearly
a
year
old
and
the
superfluous
proximity
of
an
angular
and
aquiline
lady
to
whom
sir
baldwin
had
not
been
introduced
but
who
was
openly
hanging
upon
his
words
drove
the
good
man
last
scruple
to
the
winds
very
deceptive
these
likenesses
said
he
raising
his
voice
for
the
interloper
benefit
in
future
i
shall
beware
of
them
i
need
tell
you
uniacke
that
i
never
before
set
eyes
upon
the
lady
whom
i
fear
i
embarrassed
by
behaving
as
though
i
had
rachel
was
not
less
fortunate
in
her
companion
of
the
moment
which
had
so
nearly
witnessed
her
undoing
hugh
woodgate
saw
nothing
inexplicable
in
steel
behavior
upon
her
introduction
to
sir
baldwin
gibson
and
anything
he
did
see
he
attributed
to
an
inconvenient
sense
of
that
dignitary
greatness
he
did
not
think
the
matter
worth
mentioning
to
his
wife
when
the
steels
had
dropped
them
at
the
vicarage
gate
after
a
pleasant
but
somewhat
silent
drive
neither
did
rachel
see
fit
to
speak
of
it
to
her
husband
there
was
a
certain
unworthy
satisfaction
in
her
keeping
something
from
him
but
again
she
underrated
his
uncanny
powers
of
observation
and
yet
again
he
turned
the
tables
upon
her
by
a
sudden
display
of
the
very
knowledge
which
she
was
painfully
keeping
to
herself
of
course
you
recognized
the
judge
said
steel
following
his
wife
for
once
into
her
own
apartments
where
he
immediately
shut
a
door
behind
him
and
another
in
front
of
rachel
who
stood
at
bay
before
the
glitter
in
his
eyes
of
course
she
admitted
with
irritating
nonchalance
and
he
you
i
thought
he
did
at
first
afterwards
i
was
not
so
sure
but
i
am
exclaimed
steel
through
his
teeth
rachel
face
was
a
mixture
of
surprise
and
incredulity
how
can
you
know
she
asked
coldly
you
were
at
least
a
hundred
yards
away
at
the
time
for
i
saw
you
with
morna
woodgate
and
do
you
think
my
sight
is
not
good
for
a
hundred
yards
retorted
steel
when
you
are
at
the
end
of
them
i
saw
the
whole
thing
his
confusion
and
yours
but
then
i
did
not
know
who
he
was
he
must
have
been
in
the
house
when
we
arrived
otherwise
i
should
have
taken
good
care
that
you
never
met
i
saw
enough
however
to
bring
me
up
in
time
to
see
and
hear
more
i
heard
the
way
he
was
talking
to
you
then
that
was
his
damned
and
he
has
us
at
his
mercy
all
the
same
rachel
had
never
seen
her
husband
in
such
a
passion
indeed
she
had
never
before
known
him
in
a
state
of
mind
to
justify
the
use
of
such
a
word
he
was
paler
than
his
wont
his
eyes
brighter
his
lips
more
bloodless
rachel
experienced
a
strange
sense
of
advantage
at
once
unprecedented
and
unforeseen
and
with
it
an
irresistible
temptation
to
the
sort
of
revenge
which
she
knew
to
be
petty
at
the
time
but
he
had
made
her
suffer
for
once
it
was
her
turn
he
could
be
cold
as
ice
when
she
was
not
could
deny
her
his
confidence
when
she
all
but
fell
upon
her
knees
before
him
he
should
learn
what
it
was
to
be
treated
as
he
had
treated
her
i
well
aware
of
it
said
rachel
with
a
harsh
dry
laugh
though
in
point
of
fact
i
do
for
a
moment
believe
that
he
give
me
away
but
really
i
do
think
it
matters
if
he
does
steel
stared
it
was
wonderful
to
her
to
see
his
face
it
does
matter
he
repeated
in
angry
astonishment
not
to
me
rejoined
rachel
bitterly
you
tell
me
nothing
what
can
matter
to
me
when
you
can
tell
me
why
you
felt
compelled
to
marry
me
when
you
have
the
courage
to
tell
me
that
other
things
may
begin
to
matter
again
steel
stared
harder
than
before
he
did
not
flinch
but
his
eyes
seemed
to
hedge
together
as
he
stared
and
the
glittering
light
in
them
to
concentrate
in
one
baleful
gleam
yet
it
was
not
a
cruel
look
it
was
the
look
of
a
man
who
has
sealed
his
lips
upon
one
point
for
ever
and
who
views
any
questioning
on
that
point
as
an
attempt
upon
his
treasury
there
was
more
of
than
of
actual
hostility
in
the
compressed
lips
the
bloodless
face
the
glaring
eyes
then
with
a
shrug
the
look
the
resentment
and
the
passion
were
shaken
off
and
steel
stepped
briskly
to
the
inner
door
which
he
had
shut
in
path
opening
it
he
bowed
her
through
with
a
ceremony
conspicuous
even
in
their
ceremonious
relations
but
rachel
nursed
her
contrariety
even
to
the
extent
of
a
perverse
satisfaction
at
her
encounter
with
the
judge
and
a
fierce
enjoyment
of
its
still
possible
consequences
the
mood
was
neither
logical
nor
generous
and
yet
it
was
human
enough
in
the
actual
circumstances
of
the
case
at
last
she
had
made
him
feel
it
had
taken
her
the
better
part
of
a
year
but
here
at
last
was
something
that
he
really
felt
and
it
had
to
do
with
her
it
was
impending
disaster
to
herself
which
had
brought
about
this
change
in
her
husband
she
knew
him
too
well
not
to
acquit
him
of
purely
selfish
solicitude
for
his
own
good
name
and
comfortable
status
in
a
society
for
which
he
had
no
real
regard
there
was
never
a
man
less
dependent
upon
the
good
opinion
of
other
men
in
absolute
independence
of
character
as
in
sheer
strength
of
personality
steel
stood
by
himself
in
the
estimation
of
his
wife
but
he
had
deceived
her
unnecessarily
for
weeks
and
months
he
had
lied
to
her
he
had
refused
her
his
whole
confidence
when
she
begged
him
for
it
and
when
he
knew
how
he
could
trust
her
there
was
some
deep
mystery
underlying
their
marriage
he
could
not
deny
it
yet
he
would
not
tell
her
what
it
was
he
had
made
her
suffer
needless
pain
it
was
his
turn
and
yet
with
all
her
resentment
against
him
and
all
her
grim
savoring
of
the
scandal
which
he
seemed
to
fear
so
much
there
ran
a
golden
thread
of
unacknowledged
contentment
in
the
conviction
that
those
fears
were
all
for
her
outwardly
she
was
callous
to
the
last
degree
reckless
as
on
the
day
she
made
this
marriage
and
as
as
it
was
possible
to
appear
but
the
excitement
of
the
coming
was
no
small
help
to
rachel
in
the
maintenance
of
this
attitude
it
was
to
be
a
very
large
and
rachel
first
in
her
own
house
in
any
case
she
must
have
been
upon
her
mettle
two
dozen
had
accepted
the
upthorpe
party
was
coming
in
force
if
anybody
knew
anything
it
would
be
venables
what
would
she
do
or
say
venables
was
capable
of
doing
or
of
saying
anything
and
what
might
not
happen
before
the
day
was
out
it
was
a
stimulating
situation
for
one
so
curiously
compact
of
courage
and
of
nerves
as
the
present
mistress
of
normanthorpe
house
and
for
once
she
really
was
mistress
inspecting
the
silver
with
her
own
eyes
arranging
the
flowers
with
her
own
hands
and
what
was
more
difficult
the
order
in
which
the
people
were
to
sit
she
was
thus
engaged
in
her
own
sanctum
when
venables
did
the
one
thing
which
rachel
had
not
dreamt
of
her
doing
she
called
at
three
in
the
afternoon
and
sent
her
name
upstairs
rachel
heart
made
itself
felt
but
she
was
not
afraid
something
was
coming
earlier
than
she
had
thought
she
was
chiefly
curious
to
know
what
her
first
impulse
was
to
have
venables
brought
upstairs
and
to
invoke
her
aid
in
the
arrangement
of
the
table
before
that
lady
could
open
fire
rachel
disliked
the
great
cold
and
felt
that
she
must
be
at
a
disadvantage
in
any
interview
there
on
the
other
hand
if
this
was
a
hostile
visit
the
visitor
could
not
be
treated
with
too
much
consideration
and
so
the
servant
was
dismissed
with
word
that
her
mistress
would
not
be
a
moment
nor
was
rachel
very
many
she
glanced
in
a
glass
but
that
was
all
she
might
have
been
tidier
but
not
easily
more
animated
confident
and
alert
she
had
reached
the
landing
when
she
returned
and
collected
all
the
cards
which
she
had
been
trying
to
arrange
they
made
quite
a
pack
and
rachel
laughed
as
she
took
them
downstairs
with
her
venables
sat
in
solitary
stiffness
on
the
highest
chair
she
had
been
able
to
find
neither
sybil
nor
vera
was
in
attendance
a
tableful
of
light
literature
was
at
her
elbow
but
venables
sat
with
folded
hands
this
is
too
good
of
you
cried
rachel
greeting
her
in
a
manner
redeemed
from
hypocrisy
by
a
touch
of
irresistible
irony
you
know
my
inexperience
and
you
have
come
to
tell
me
things
have
you
not
you
could
not
have
come
at
a
better
time
how
you
fit
in
people
at
one
table
i
wanted
to
have
two
at
each
end
and
it
ca
be
done
venables
suppressed
a
smile
suggestive
of
some
unconscious
humor
in
these
remarks
but
sat
more
upright
than
ever
in
her
chair
with
a
hard
light
in
the
bright
brown
eyes
that
stared
serenely
into
rachel
own
i
can
not
say
i
came
to
offer
you
my
assistance
steel
i
only
take
liberties
with
very
intimate
friends
then
i
wonder
what
can
have
brought
you
and
rachel
returned
both
the
smile
and
the
stare
with
irritating
i
will
tell
you
said
venables
weightily
there
is
a
certain
thing
being
said
of
you
steel
and
i
wish
to
know
from
your
own
lips
whether
there
is
any
truth
in
it
or
none
rachel
held
up
her
hands
as
quick
as
thought
my
dear
venables
you
ca
mean
that
you
are
bringing
me
a
piece
of
unpleasant
gossip
on
the
very
afternoon
of
my
first
it
remains
with
you
said
venables
changing
color
at
this
hit
to
say
whether
it
is
mere
gossip
or
not
you
must
know
steel
though
we
were
all
quite
charmed
with
your
husband
from
the
moment
he
came
among
us
we
none
of
us
had
the
least
idea
where
he
came
from
nor
have
we
yet
you
are
speaking
for
the
neighborhood
inquired
rachel
sweetly
i
am
said
venables
town
county
murmured
rachel
and
you
mean
that
nobody
in
the
district
knew
anything
at
all
about
my
husband
not
a
thing
said
venables
and
yet
you
called
on
him
and
yet
you
took
pity
on
him
poor
lonely
bachelor
that
he
was
this
shaft
also
left
its
momentary
mark
upon
the
visitor
complexion
the
same
applies
to
you
she
went
on
the
more
severely
we
had
no
idea
who
you
were
either
and
now
said
rachel
still
mistress
of
the
situation
for
she
knew
so
well
what
was
coming
and
now
we
hear
and
i
wish
to
know
whether
it
is
true
or
not
were
you
or
were
you
not
the
minchin
who
was
tried
last
winter
for
her
husband
murder
rachel
looked
steadily
into
the
hard
brown
eyes
until
a
certain
hardness
came
into
her
own
i
do
quite
know
what
right
you
think
you
have
to
ask
me
such
a
question
venables
is
it
the
usual
thing
to
question
people
who
have
made
a
second
marriage
supposing
i
am
one
about
their
first
i
fancied
myself
that
it
was
considered
bad
form
but
then
i
am
still
very
ignorant
of
the
manners
and
customs
in
this
part
of
the
world
since
you
ask
it
however
you
shall
have
your
answer
and
rachel
voice
rang
out
through
the
room
as
she
rose
majestically
from
the
chair
which
she
had
drawn
opposite
that
of
the
visitor
yes
venables
i
am
that
unhappy
woman
and
what
then
no
wonder
you
were
silent
about
yourself
said
venables
in
a
vindictive
murmur
no
wonder
we
never
even
heard
and
what
then
repeated
rachel
with
a
quiet
and
compelling
scorn
does
it
put
one
outside
the
local
pale
to
keep
to
oneself
any
painful
incident
in
one
own
career
is
an
accusation
down
here
the
same
thing
as
a
conviction
is
there
nothing
to
choose
between
and
guilty
you
must
be
aware
proceeded
venables
without
taking
any
notice
of
these
questions
indeed
you
can
not
fail
to
be
perfectly
well
aware
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
public
was
dissatisfied
with
the
verdict
in
your
case
your
husband
for
one
rachel
agreed
with
a
scornful
laugh
he
would
have
come
to
see
me
hanged
he
told
me
so
at
his
own
table
you
never
would
have
been
at
his
table
retorted
venables
with
some
effect
if
he
or
i
had
dreamt
who
you
were
but
now
that
we
know
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
none
of
us
will
sit
at
yours
and
venables
rose
up
in
all
her
might
and
spite
her
brown
eyes
flashing
her
handsome
head
thrown
back
are
you
still
speaking
for
the
district
inquired
rachel
conquering
a
recreant
lip
to
put
the
question
and
putting
it
with
her
finest
scorn
i
am
speaking
for
venables
my
daughters
and
myself
rejoined
the
lady
with
great
dignity
others
will
speak
for
themselves
and
you
will
soon
learn
in
what
light
you
are
regarded
by
ordinary
people
it
is
a
merciful
chance
that
we
have
found
you
out
a
merciful
chance
that
you
should
dare
you
about
whom
there
are
not
two
opinions
among
sensible
people
that
you
should
dare
to
come
among
us
as
you
have
done
and
to
speak
to
me
as
you
have
spoken
but
one
thing
is
certain
it
is
for
the
last
time
with
that
venables
sailed
to
the
door
by
which
she
was
to
make
her
triumphant
exit
but
she
stopped
before
reaching
it
steel
stood
before
her
on
the
threshold
and
as
he
stood
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
as
he
closed
it
he
turned
and
took
out
the
key
there
was
the
other
door
that
led
through
the
conservatory
into
the
garden
without
a
word
he
crossed
the
room
shut
that
door
also
locked
it
and
put
the
two
keys
in
his
pocket
then
at
last
he
turned
to
the
imprisoned
lady
you
are
quite
right
venables
it
is
the
last
conversation
we
are
likely
to
have
together
the
greater
the
pity
to
cut
it
short
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
let
me
go
the
visitor
demanded
white
and
trembling
but
not
yet
unimpressive
in
her
tremendous
indignation
with
the
greatest
alacrity
replied
steel
when
you
have
apologized
to
my
wife
rachel
stood
by
without
a
word
for
what
cried
venables
for
telling
her
what
the
whole
world
thinks
of
her
never
and
you
will
unlock
that
door
this
instant
unless
you
wish
my
husband
to
to
horsewhip
you
within
an
inch
of
your
life
steel
merely
smiled
he
could
well
afford
to
do
so
lithe
and
supple
as
he
still
was
with
flabby
venables
in
his
mind
eye
i
might
have
known
what
to
expect
in
this
house
continued
venables
in
a
voice
hoarse
with
suppressed
passion
what
unmanly
and
ungentlemanly
behavior
what
cowardly
insults
i
might
have
known
and
she
glanced
from
the
windows
to
the
bells
it
is
no
use
ringing
said
steel
with
a
shake
of
his
snowy
head
or
doing
anything
else
of
the
sort
i
am
the
only
person
on
the
premises
who
can
let
you
out
your
footman
could
not
get
in
if
he
tried
but
if
you
like
i
shall
shout
to
him
to
try
as
for
insults
you
have
insulted
my
wife
most
cruelly
and
gratuitously
for
i
happen
to
have
heard
more
than
you
evidently
imagine
in
fact
is
hardly
the
word
for
what
even
i
have
heard
you
say
let
me
warn
you
madam
that
you
have
sailed
pretty
close
to
the
wind
already
in
the
way
of
indictable
slander
you
seem
to
forget
that
my
wife
was
tried
and
acquitted
by
twelve
of
her
you
will
at
least
apologize
for
that
forgetfulness
before
you
leave
this
room
never
steel
looked
at
his
watch
and
sat
down
i
begin
to
fear
you
are
no
judge
of
character
venables
otherwise
you
would
have
seen
ere
this
which
of
us
will
have
to
give
in
sooner
or
later
i
can
only
tell
you
which
of
us
never
will
and
rachel
still
stood
by
without
a
word
chapter
xvii
friends
in
need
that
afternoon
the
vicar
of
marley
was
paying
visits
among
his
humbler
parishioners
though
his
conversation
was
the
weak
point
to
which
attention
has
been
drawn
hugh
woodgate
nevertheless
possessed
the
not
too
common
knack
of
chatting
with
the
poor
he
had
the
simplicity
which
made
them
kin
and
his
sympathy
unlike
that
of
so
many
persons
who
consider
themselves
sympathetic
was
not
exclusively
reserved
for
the
and
the
ruined
home
he
wrote
letters
for
the
illiterate
found
places
for
the
unemployed
knew
one
baby
from
another
as
soon
as
their
own
mothers
and
with
his
own
hand
sent
to
the
local
papers
full
reports
of
the
village
matches
in
which
he
rarely
scored
a
run
until
this
august
afternoon
he
was
not
aware
that
he
had
made
an
actual
enemy
in
all
the
years
that
he
had
spent
in
delverton
first
as
an
overworked
northborough
curate
and
latterly
as
one
of
the
busiest
country
vicars
in
the
diocese
but
towards
five
as
woodgate
was
returning
to
the
vicarage
a
carriage
and
pair
sweeping
past
him
in
a
cloud
of
dust
left
the
clergyman
quite
petrified
on
the
roadside
his
soft
felt
hat
still
in
his
hand
the
carriage
contained
venables
who
had
simply
stared
him
in
the
face
when
he
took
it
off
woodgate
was
quite
excited
when
he
reached
the
vicarage
morna
met
him
in
the
garden
venables
cut
me
dead
he
cried
while
they
were
still
yards
apart
i
am
not
surprised
replied
morna
who
was
in
a
state
of
suppressed
excitement
herself
but
what
on
earth
is
the
meaning
of
it
she
has
just
been
here
well
she
is
not
likely
to
come
again
oh
hugh
i
do
know
how
to
tell
you
if
you
agree
with
her
for
a
moment
if
you
see
any
possible
excuse
for
the
woman
it
will
break
my
heart
morna
fine
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
the
sight
of
them
put
out
the
flame
that
had
leapt
for
once
from
stolid
hugh
and
he
took
her
hand
in
his
own
great
soothing
grasp
come
and
sit
down
he
said
and
tell
me
all
about
it
have
i
ever
taken
anybody
part
against
you
morna
that
you
should
think
me
likely
to
begin
now
no
but
you
would
if
you
thought
they
were
right
and
i
was
wrong
hugh
reflected
until
they
reached
the
upon
the
lawn
well
not
openly
at
all
events
said
he
and
not
under
any
circumstances
i
can
conceive
in
which
venables
was
the
other
person
but
she
is
the
only
other
person
that
is
just
it
oh
hugh
you
do
like
rachel
do
you
i
do
he
said
emphatically
but
surely
you
have
been
quarrelling
with
her
no
indeed
and
that
is
exactly
why
i
quarrelled
with
venables
because
i
would
refuse
to
go
to
the
at
normanthorpe
woodgate
was
naturally
nonplussed
would
refuse
he
echoed
yes
she
actually
asked
me
not
to
go
and
now
i
do
believe
she
has
gone
driving
round
to
ask
everybody
else
woodgate
amazement
ended
in
a
guffaw
and
that
is
what
you
quarrelled
about
he
roared
the
woman
must
be
mad
what
reason
did
she
give
she
had
a
reason
dear
but
not
a
good
one
there
can
be
no
excuse
for
such
an
action
let
alone
a
good
reason
morna
looked
at
her
husband
with
sidelong
anxiety
wondering
whether
he
would
say
as
much
when
he
had
heard
all
she
was
sure
enough
of
him
but
as
yet
they
had
never
differed
on
a
point
that
mattered
and
the
one
which
was
coming
mattered
infinitely
to
morna
hugh
she
began
do
you
remember
being
with
rachel
yesterday
at
hornby
when
she
was
introduced
to
sir
baldwin
gibson
perfectly
said
hugh
he
is
the
judge
you
know
yes
yes
did
you
think
they
looked
as
though
they
had
ever
seen
each
other
before
the
vicar
revolved
where
he
sat
looking
his
wife
suddenly
in
the
face
while
a
light
broke
over
his
own
now
you
speak
of
it
he
cried
they
did
it
did
strike
me
at
the
time
i
was
rather
surprised
at
her
being
so
nervous
but
that
never
occurred
to
me
as
the
explanation
yet
now
i
have
no
doubt
about
it
you
do
mean
to
say
he
knows
something
against
steel
and
has
been
giving
her
away
no
dear
the
judge
has
not
but
you
were
not
the
only
one
who
saw
the
meeting
and
other
eyes
are
more
suspicious
than
yours
hugh
darling
you
would
not
think
the
worse
of
rachel
for
keeping
her
past
life
to
herself
would
you
especially
if
it
had
been
a
very
unhappy
one
of
course
not
it
is
no
business
of
ours
so
you
told
venables
the
day
she
came
to
tell
us
steel
was
married
and
so
i
told
her
again
this
afternoon
however
that
is
not
her
main
point
and
there
is
another
thing
i
am
still
surer
you
would
never
do
if
a
person
had
been
put
upon
her
trial
and
found
not
guilty
in
open
court
you
would
not
treat
her
as
though
she
had
been
found
guilty
would
you
even
though
the
verdict
had
come
as
a
surprise
of
course
i
would
not
morna
no
decent
christian
would
i
should
hope
but
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
steel
has
been
tried
for
something
yes
and
by
justice
gibson
poor
thing
said
hugh
woodgate
after
a
pause
morna
took
his
hand
my
dear
she
is
or
rather
she
was
mrs
minchin
what
the
woman
who
was
tried
for
murdering
her
husband
yes
and
acquitted
good
heavens
exclaimed
the
vicar
and
for
a
minute
that
was
all
well
he
continued
i
did
read
the
case
and
i
am
glad
that
i
did
but
i
remember
of
course
what
was
said
about
it
at
the
time
but
what
does
it
matter
what
is
said
i
imagine
the
jury
knew
what
they
were
about
they
listened
to
the
evidence
for
a
week
i
believe
which
other
people
read
in
a
few
minutes
of
course
they
knew
best
but
how
long
have
you
known
this
morna
never
until
this
afternoon
there
was
no
reason
why
i
should
of
course
there
was
not
then
you
agree
with
me
hugh
and
morna
was
transfigured
of
course
i
agree
with
you
but
i
want
to
know
more
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
a
woman
of
education
and
ability
who
calls
herself
a
christian
like
venables
has
actually
backed
out
of
this
on
this
account
and
asked
others
to
do
the
same
she
certainly
asked
me
said
morna
and
when
i
refused
and
persisted
in
my
refusal
she
flounced
out
in
a
rage
and
must
have
cut
you
dead
next
minute
incredible
exclaimed
woodgate
i
mean
she
must
have
had
some
further
reason
oh
but
she
had
i
forgot
to
tell
you
in
my
anxiety
to
know
what
you
thought
she
came
to
me
straight
from
normanthorpe
where
they
had
insulted
her
as
she
had
never
been
insulted
in
her
life
before
who
steel
or
his
wife
steel
i
fancy
venables
had
no
name
bad
enough
for
him
but
she
brought
it
on
herself
and
i
think
more
of
him
than
i
ever
did
before
you
know
that
vinson
the
invernesses
new
agent
wife
i
do
langholm
took
her
into
dinner
the
night
we
dined
at
upthorpe
and
she
was
in
the
offing
yesterday
when
steel
was
talking
to
the
judge
exactly
it
appears
that
it
was
vinson
who
first
suspected
something
the
very
night
you
mention
and
yesterday
her
suspicions
were
confirmed
to
her
own
satisfaction
at
all
events
she
felt
justified
in
mentioning
them
to
venables
who
instantly
drove
over
to
ask
rachel
to
her
face
if
there
was
any
truth
in
the
rumor
that
she
was
or
had
been
mrs
minchin
well
rachel
told
her
it
was
perfectly
true
good
and
then
the
fat
was
in
the
fire
but
what
happened
exactly
it
was
impossible
to
gather
from
venables
i
never
saw
a
woman
so
beside
herself
with
rage
she
came
in
incoherent
and
went
out
inarticulate
from
the
things
she
said
of
him
i
could
only
guess
that
steel
had
come
upon
the
scene
and
insulted
her
as
she
deserved
to
be
insulted
but
i
would
give
a
good
deal
to
know
what
did
happen
would
you
really
morna
started
to
her
feet
the
vicar
rose
more
slowly
after
sitting
for
some
moments
in
mute
confusion
it
was
steel
who
stood
before
them
on
their
lawn
pale
as
death
and
ten
years
older
since
the
day
before
yet
with
a
smile
upon
her
bloodless
lips
which
appeared
indeed
to
express
some
faint
irresistible
amusement
would
you
really
like
to
know
she
repeated
standing
at
a
distance
from
them
her
great
eyes
travelling
from
one
to
the
other
it
is
strange
because
i
had
come
on
purpose
to
tell
you
both
that
and
all
the
rest
but
especially
all
the
rest
in
which
it
seems
venables
has
been
before
me
she
paused
an
instant
and
the
corners
of
her
sad
mouth
twitched
just
once
what
my
husband
did
said
rachel
was
to
lock
the
doors
and
refuse
to
let
her
out
until
she
had
begged
my
pardon
i
hope
she
did
so
said
hugh
woodgate
with
the
emphasis
which
often
atoned
for
the
inadequacy
of
his
remarks
in
about
three
minutes
replied
rachel
dryly
with
some
pride
but
no
triumph
in
her
tone
morna
had
not
spoken
now
she
took
a
quick
step
forward
her
eyes
brimming
but
rachel
held
up
her
hand
you
are
sure
you
realize
who
i
am
yes
rachel
rachel
minchin
added
rachel
harshly
the
notorious
minchin
the
minchin
whom
venables
would
have
come
to
see
hanged
hush
rachel
hush
then
be
honest
with
me
mind
honest
not
kind
you
would
not
have
said
what
venables
said
to
me
she
said
that
all
the
world
believed
me
guilty
you
would
not
have
said
that
morna
but
are
you
sure
you
would
not
have
said
it
in
your
heart
can
you
look
me
in
the
face
and
tell
me
you
do
believe
it
like
all
the
rest
of
the
world
there
was
no
faltering
of
the
firm
sweet
voice
it
was
only
unutterably
sad
and
morna
answered
it
only
with
a
sob
as
she
flung
her
arms
round
rachel
neck
while
her
husband
waited
with
outstretched
hand
chapter
xviii
they
which
were
bidden
the
cottage
of
charles
langholm
dreams
which
could
not
have
come
true
in
a
more
charming
particular
stood
on
a
wooded
hill
at
the
back
of
a
village
some
three
miles
from
normanthorpe
it
was
one
of
two
cottages
under
the
same
tiled
roof
and
in
the
other
there
lived
an
admirable
couple
who
supplied
all
material
wants
of
the
simple
life
which
the
novelist
led
when
at
work
in
his
idle
intervals
the
place
knew
him
not
a
nomadic
tendency
was
given
free
play
and
the
man
was
a
wanderer
on
the
face
of
europe
but
he
wandered
less
than
he
had
done
from
london
finding
in
his
remote
but
fragrant
corner
of
the
earth
that
peace
which
twenty
years
of
a
strenuous
manhood
had
taught
him
to
value
more
than
downright
happiness
its
roses
were
not
the
only
merit
of
this
ideal
retreat
though
in
the
summer
months
they
made
it
difficult
for
one
with
eyes
and
nostrils
to
appreciate
the
others
there
was
a
delightful
room
running
right
through
the
cottage
and
it
was
here
that
langholm
worked
ate
smoked
read
and
had
his
daily
being
his
bath
was
in
the
room
adjoining
and
his
bed
in
another
adjoining
that
of
the
upper
floor
he
made
no
use
it
was
filled
with
the
neglected
furniture
of
a
more
substantial
establishment
and
langholm
seldom
so
much
as
set
foot
upon
the
stairs
the
lower
rooms
were
very
simply
furnished
there
was
a
really
old
oak
bureau
and
some
solid
comfortable
chairs
the
pictures
were
chiefly
photographs
of
other
writers
there
were
better
pictures
deep
in
dust
upstairs
an
artist
in
temperament
if
not
in
attainment
langholm
had
of
late
years
found
the
ups
and
downs
of
his
own
work
supply
all
the
excitement
that
was
necessary
to
his
life
it
was
only
when
the
work
was
done
that
his
solitude
had
oppressed
him
but
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
had
been
the
case
of
late
weeks
his
new
book
had
been
written
under
the
spur
of
an
external
stimulus
it
had
not
written
itself
like
all
the
more
reputable
members
of
the
large
but
family
to
which
it
belonged
langholm
had
not
felt
lonely
in
the
breathing
spaces
between
the
later
chapters
on
the
contrary
he
would
walk
up
and
down
among
his
roses
with
the
animated
face
of
one
on
the
happy
heights
of
intercourse
with
a
kindred
spirit
when
in
reality
he
was
quite
alone
but
the
man
wrote
novels
and
withal
believed
in
them
at
the
time
of
writing
it
was
true
that
on
one
occasion
when
the
steels
came
to
tea
the
novelist
walked
his
garden
with
the
radiant
face
with
which
he
had
lately
taken
to
walking
it
alone
but
that
also
was
natural
enough
the
change
came
on
the
very
day
he
finished
his
book
when
langholm
made
himself
presentable
and
rode
off
to
the
at
hornby
manor
in
spirits
worthy
of
the
occasion
about
seven
of
the
same
evening
he
dismounted
heavily
in
the
outside
the
cottage
and
pushed
his
machine
through
the
wicket
a
different
man
a
detail
declared
his
depression
to
the
woman
next
door
who
was
preparing
him
a
more
substantial
meal
than
langholm
ever
thought
of
ordering
for
himself
he
went
straight
through
to
his
roses
without
changing
his
party
coat
for
the
norfolk
jacket
in
which
he
had
spent
that
summer
and
the
last
the
garden
behind
the
two
cottages
was
all
langholm
the
whole
thing
levelled
would
not
have
made
a
single
court
nor
yet
a
practice
pitch
of
proper
length
yet
this
little
garden
contained
almost
everything
that
a
garden
need
have
there
were
tall
pines
among
the
timber
to
one
side
and
through
these
set
the
sun
so
that
on
the
hottest
days
the
garden
was
in
sufficient
shadow
by
the
time
the
morning
work
was
done
there
was
a
little
large
enough
for
a
and
a
rug
there
was
a
hedge
of
penzance
opposite
the
backdoor
and
the
window
at
which
langholm
wrote
and
yet
this
hedge
broke
down
in
the
very
nick
and
place
to
give
the
lucky
writer
a
long
glimpse
across
a
green
valley
with
dim
woods
upon
the
opposite
hill
and
then
there
were
the
roses
planted
by
the
last
cottager
a
retired
gardener
a
greater
artist
than
his
successor
a
man
who
knew
what
roses
were
over
the
house
clambered
a
william
allen
richardson
and
two
gloires
de
dijon
these
last
the
first
still
resting
from
a
profuse
yield
in
june
in
the
southeast
corner
a
crimson
rambler
was
at
its
ripe
red
height
and
caroline
testout
margaret
dickson
la
france
madame
lambard
and
madame
cochet
blushed
from
pale
pink
to
richest
red
or
remained
coldly
but
beautifully
white
at
the
foot
of
the
penzance
briers
langholm
had
not
known
one
rose
from
another
when
he
came
to
live
among
this
galaxy
now
they
were
his
separate
familiar
individual
friends
each
with
its
own
character
in
his
eyes
its
own
charm
for
him
and
the
man
soul
was
the
sweeter
for
each
summer
spent
in
their
midst
but
they
called
to
closed
nostrils
and
blind
eyes
and
the
evening
sun
reddening
the
upper
stems
of
the
pines
and
warming
the
mellow
tiles
of
his
dear
cottage
had
no
more
to
say
to
langholm
spirit
than
his
beloved
roses
the
man
had
emerged
from
the
dreamy
artistic
aesthetic
existence
into
which
he
had
drifted
through
living
alone
amid
so
much
simple
beauty
he
was
in
real
human
haunting
trouble
and
the
manlier
man
for
it
already
could
he
be
mistaken
after
all
no
the
more
he
pondered
the
more
convinced
he
felt
everything
pointed
to
the
same
conclusion
beginning
with
that
first
at
upthorpe
and
that
first
conversation
of
which
he
remembered
every
word
steel
was
minchin
the
notorious
minchin
the
minchin
who
had
been
tried
for
her
husband
murder
and
acquitted
to
the
horror
of
a
righteous
world
and
he
had
been
going
to
write
a
book
about
her
and
it
was
she
herself
who
had
given
him
the
idea
but
was
it
there
had
been
much
light
talk
about
steel
novel
and
the
plot
that
steel
had
given
langholm
but
that
view
of
the
matter
had
been
more
of
a
standing
joke
than
an
intellectual
bond
between
them
it
was
strange
to
think
of
it
in
the
former
light
langholm
recalled
more
than
one
conversation
upon
the
same
subject
it
had
had
a
fascination
for
rachel
which
somehow
he
was
sorry
to
remember
now
then
he
recollected
the
one
end
to
all
these
conversations
and
his
momentary
regret
was
swept
away
by
a
rush
of
sympathy
which
it
did
him
good
to
feel
they
had
ended
invariably
in
her
obtaining
from
him
on
one
cunning
pretext
or
another
a
fresh
assurance
of
his
belief
in
minchin
innocence
langholm
radiated
among
his
roses
as
his
memory
convinced
him
of
this
rachel
had
not
talked
about
her
case
and
his
plot
for
the
morbid
excitement
of
discussing
herself
with
another
but
for
the
solid
and
wholesome
satisfaction
of
hearing
yet
again
that
the
other
disbelieved
in
her
guilt
and
did
he
not
langholm
stood
still
in
the
scented
dusk
as
he
asked
his
heart
of
hearts
the
question
and
it
was
a
crisper
step
that
he
resumed
with
a
face
more
radiant
than
before
yes
analytical
as
he
was
there
at
least
he
was
satisfied
with
himself
thank
god
he
had
always
been
of
one
opinion
on
that
one
point
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
about
her
long
before
he
knew
the
whilom
minchin
in
the
flesh
and
had
let
her
know
which
way
almost
as
long
before
the
secret
of
her
identity
could
possibly
have
dawned
upon
him
now
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
his
sincerity
at
least
could
not
be
questioned
others
might
pretend
others
again
be
unconsciously
prejudiced
in
favor
of
their
friend
he
at
least
was
above
either
suspicion
had
he
not
argued
her
case
with
venables
at
the
time
and
had
he
not
told
her
so
on
the
very
evening
that
they
met
certainly
langholm
felt
in
a
strong
position
if
ever
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
it
illustrated
a
little
weakness
however
that
he
himself
foresaw
no
such
immediate
eventuality
there
had
been
a
very
brief
encounter
between
two
persons
at
a
and
a
yet
more
brief
confusion
upon
either
side
of
all
this
there
existed
but
witnesses
at
the
outside
and
langholm
did
not
credit
the
other
five
with
his
own
trained
insight
and
powers
of
observation
he
furthermore
reflected
that
those
others
even
if
as
close
observers
as
himself
could
not
possibly
have
put
two
and
two
together
as
he
had
done
and
this
was
sound
but
langholm
had
a
fatal
knack
of
overlooking
the
lady
whom
he
had
taken
in
to
dinner
at
upthorpe
hall
and
scarcely
noticed
at
hornby
manor
cocksure
as
he
himself
was
of
the
significance
of
that
which
he
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
the
observer
flattered
himself
that
he
was
the
only
real
one
present
remembered
the
special
knowledge
which
he
had
to
assist
his
vision
and
relied
properly
enough
upon
the
silence
of
sir
baldwin
gibson
the
greater
the
secret
however
the
more
piquant
the
situation
for
one
who
was
in
it
and
there
were
moments
of
a
sleepless
night
in
which
langholm
found
nothing
new
to
regret
but
he
was
in
a
quandary
none
the
less
he
could
scarcely
meet
steel
again
without
a
word
about
the
prospective
story
which
they
had
so
often
discussed
together
and
upon
which
he
was
at
last
free
to
embark
nor
could
he
touch
upon
that
theme
without
disclosing
the
new
knowledge
which
would
burn
him
until
he
did
charles
langholm
and
rachel
steel
had
two
or
three
qualities
in
common
an
utter
inability
to
pretend
was
one
if
you
do
not
happen
to
think
it
a
defect
as
a
rule
when
he
had
finished
a
rapid
bit
of
writing
langholm
sat
down
to
correct
and
a
depressing
task
his
spent
brain
always
found
it
but
for
once
he
let
it
beat
him
altogether
after
a
morning
tussle
with
one
unfortunate
chapter
the
desperate
author
sent
off
the
rest
in
their
sins
and
rode
his
bicycle
to
abolish
thought
but
that
mild
pastime
fell
lamentably
short
of
its
usual
efficacy
it
was
not
one
of
his
heroines
who
was
worrying
the
novelist
but
a
real
woman
whom
he
liked
and
her
husband
whom
he
did
not
the
husband
it
was
who
had
finished
matters
by
entering
the
field
of
speculation
during
the
morning
work
it
may
be
confessed
that
langholm
had
not
by
any
means
disliked
him
the
year
before
what
was
the
secret
of
this
second
marriage
on
the
part
of
one
who
had
been
so
recently
and
so
miserably
married
was
it
love
langholm
would
not
admit
it
for
a
moment
steel
did
not
love
his
wife
and
there
was
certainly
nothing
to
love
in
steel
langholm
had
begun
almost
to
hate
him
he
told
himself
it
was
because
steel
did
not
even
pretend
to
love
his
wife
but
let
strangers
see
the
abnormal
terms
on
which
they
lived
what
then
was
the
explanation
the
history
the
excuse
they
were
supposed
to
have
married
on
the
continent
that
was
one
of
the
few
statements
vouchsafed
by
steel
and
he
happened
to
have
made
it
in
the
first
instance
to
langholm
himself
was
there
any
truth
in
it
and
did
steel
know
the
truth
concerning
his
wife
your
imaginative
man
is
ever
quick
to
form
a
theory
based
upon
facts
of
his
own
involuntary
invention
langholm
formed
numerous
theories
and
invented
innumerable
facts
during
the
hours
of
his
present
separation
from
the
heroine
and
the
villain
of
these
romances
the
likeliest
of
the
lot
was
the
idea
that
the
pair
had
really
met
abroad
at
some
place
where
rachel
had
been
in
hiding
from
the
world
and
that
in
her
despair
of
receiving
common
justice
from
her
kind
she
had
accepted
the
rich
man
without
telling
him
who
she
was
his
subsequent
enlightenment
was
langholm
explanation
of
coldness
towards
his
wife
he
wondered
if
it
was
the
kind
of
coldness
that
would
ever
be
removed
if
steel
believed
her
guilty
it
never
would
langholm
would
not
have
admitted
it
was
not
even
aware
of
it
in
his
own
introspective
mind
but
he
almost
hoped
that
steel
was
not
thoroughly
convinced
of
his
innocence
the
night
of
the
was
so
fine
and
the
roads
so
clean
that
langholm
went
off
on
his
bicycle
once
more
making
an
incongruous
figure
in
his
but
pedalling
sedately
to
keep
cool
fortune
however
was
against
him
for
they
had
begun
clipping
those
northern
hedgerows
and
an
ominous
bumping
upon
a
perfectly
flat
road
led
to
the
discovery
of
a
puncture
a
long
mile
from
normanthorpe
thence
onward
the
unhappy
cyclist
had
to
choose
between
running
beside
his
machine
and
riding
on
the
rims
and
between
the
two
expedients
arrived
at
last
both
very
hot
and
rather
late
but
he
thought
he
must
be
very
late
for
he
neither
met
followed
nor
was
followed
by
any
vehicle
whatsoever
in
the
drive
and
the
door
did
not
open
before
langholm
rang
as
it
does
when
they
are
still
waiting
for
one
then
the
house
seemed
strangely
silent
when
the
door
did
open
and
the
footman
wore
a
curious
expression
as
he
ushered
the
late
comer
into
an
empty
langholm
was
now
almost
convinced
that
he
had
made
some
absurd
mistake
and
the
impression
was
not
removed
by
the
entry
of
steel
with
his
napkin
in
one
hand
i
mistaken
the
night
exclaimed
the
perspiring
author
not
a
bit
of
it
replied
steel
only
we
thought
you
were
coming
at
all
am
i
really
so
late
as
all
that
and
langholm
began
to
wish
he
had
mistaken
the
night
no
said
steel
only
a
very
few
minutes
and
the
sin
is
ours
entirely
but
we
thought
you
were
staying
away
like
everybody
else
like
everybody
else
my
dear
fellow
said
steel
smiling
on
the
other
bewilderment
i
humbly
apologize
for
having
classed
you
for
an
instant
with
the
rank
and
file
of
our
delightful
neighbors
for
the
fact
is
that
all
but
two
have
made
their
excuses
at
the
last
moment
the
telegrams
will
delight
you
one
of
these
days
there
was
none
from
me
declared
langholm
as
he
began
to
perceive
what
had
happened
there
was
not
and
my
wife
was
quite
confident
that
you
would
come
so
the
fault
is
altogether
mine
langholm
you
were
almost
at
her
heels
when
she
was
introduced
to
the
old
judge
yesterday
i
was
have
you
guessed
who
she
was
before
she
married
me
or
has
anybody
told
you
i
have
guessed
steel
stood
silent
for
an
instant
his
eyes
resting
in
calm
scrutiny
upon
the
other
his
mouth
as
firm
and
fixed
his
face
fresh
as
a
young
man
his
hair
like
spun
silver
in
the
electric
light
langholm
looked
upon
the
man
who
was
looking
upon
him
and
he
could
not
hate
him
as
he
would
and
do
you
still
desire
to
dine
with
us
inquired
his
host
at
last
i
do
want
to
be
in
the
way
faltered
langholm
on
a
painful
oh
never
mind
that
cried
steel
are
you
quite
sure
you
do
want
to
cut
our
acquaintance
you
know
i
do
said
langholm
bluntly
then
come
in
pray
and
take
us
as
we
are
one
moment
steel
all
this
is
inconceivable
do
you
mean
to
say
that
your
guests
have
thrown
you
over
on
account
of
of
my
wife
having
been
a
certain
minchin
before
she
changed
her
name
to
steel
yes
every
one
of
them
except
our
vicar
and
his
wife
who
are
real
good
friends
i
am
another
said
langholm
through
his
big
mustache
the
very
servants
are
giving
notice
one
by
one
i
am
her
servant
too
muttered
langholm
as
steel
stood
aside
to
let
him
pass
out
first
but
this
time
it
was
through
his
teeth
though
from
his
heart
and
the
words
were
only
audible
to
himself
chapter
xix
rachel
champion
the
immediate
ordeal
proved
less
trying
than
langholm
was
prepared
to
find
it
his
vivid
imagination
had
pictured
the
long
table
laid
for
with
four
persons
huddled
at
one
end
but
the
telegrams
had
come
in
time
to
have
the
table
reduced
to
its
normal
size
and
langholm
found
a
place
set
for
him
between
woodgate
and
steel
he
was
only
embarrassed
when
rachel
rose
and
looked
him
in
the
eyes
before
holding
out
her
hand
have
you
heard
she
asked
him
in
a
voice
as
cold
as
her
marble
face
but
similarly
redeemed
and
animated
by
its
delicate
and
distant
scorn
yes
answered
langholm
sadly
yes
i
have
heard
and
yet
he
interrupted
her
in
another
tone
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
i
give
you
warning
steel
i
wo
listen
to
it
no
yets
for
me
remember
the
belief
i
had
long
before
i
knew
anything
at
all
it
ought
not
to
be
a
whit
stronger
for
what
i
guessed
yesterday
for
myself
and
what
your
husband
has
this
minute
confirmed
yet
it
is
if
possible
ten
thousand
times
stronger
and
more
sure
i
do
remember
said
rachel
slowly
and
in
my
turn
i
believe
what
you
say
but
her
face
did
not
alter
as
she
took
his
hand
her
own
was
so
cold
that
he
looked
at
her
in
alarm
and
the
whole
woman
seemed
turned
to
stone
yet
the
dinner
went
on
without
further
hitch
it
might
have
been
the
very
smallest
and
homeliest
affair
to
which
only
these
guests
had
been
invited
indeed
the
menu
had
been
reduced
like
the
table
by
the
unerring
tact
of
rachel
husband
so
that
there
was
no
undue
memorial
to
the
missing
and
the
whole
ordeal
was
curtailed
there
was
on
the
other
hand
no
blinking
what
had
happened
no
pretence
of
ignoring
the
one
subject
which
was
in
everybody
thoughts
thus
woodgate
exclaimed
aloud
what
she
was
thinking
to
herself
that
she
would
never
speak
to
venables
again
in
all
her
life
and
her
husband
told
her
across
the
table
that
she
had
better
not
rachel
thereupon
put
in
her
word
to
the
effect
that
the
woodgates
would
cut
themselves
off
from
everybody
if
they
made
enemies
of
all
who
disbelieved
in
her
and
she
could
not
allow
them
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
steel
again
speculated
upon
the
probable
behavior
of
the
uniackes
and
the
invernesses
neither
of
these
distinguished
families
having
been
invited
to
the
dinner
for
obvious
reasons
arising
from
their
still
recent
return
to
the
country
there
was
no
effort
to
ignore
the
absorbing
topic
before
the
butler
and
his
satellites
but
the
line
was
drawn
in
the
right
place
excluding
as
it
did
any
reference
to
the
rout
of
venables
and
indeed
all
details
whatsoever
the
butler
however
and
in
a
less
degree
the
footman
presented
a
rather
interesting
study
during
the
course
of
this
momentous
meal
had
the
professional
observer
present
been
only
a
little
less
concerned
for
his
hostess
the
butler
was
a
pompous
but
capable
creature
whom
steel
had
engaged
when
he
bought
the
place
though
speedily
reduced
to
a
more
respectful
servitude
than
he
was
accustomed
to
the
man
had
long
since
ceased
to
complain
of
his
situation
which
carried
with
it
the
highest
wages
and
all
arbitrary
powers
over
his
subordinates
on
the
steps
at
her
deferred
departure
venables
had
screamed
the
secret
of
his
mistress
identity
into
the
butler
ear
the
butler
had
risen
with
dignity
to
the
occasion
and
after
a
brief
interview
resigned
on
the
spot
with
all
his
men
the
mild
interest
was
in
the
present
behavior
of
these
gentry
which
was
a
rich
blend
of
dignity
and
depression
and
betrayed
a
growing
doubt
as
to
whether
the
sinking
ship
that
they
had
been
so
eager
to
abandon
was
really
sinking
after
all
certainly
the
master
manner
could
not
have
been
very
different
at
the
head
of
his
table
as
originally
laid
it
was
not
festive
it
was
neither
unnaturally
jocular
nor
showy
in
any
way
but
it
was
delightfully
confident
and
serene
and
the
mistress
was
as
calm
in
her
way
though
for
once
hers
was
the
colder
way
and
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
pantry
that
she
felt
more
than
she
showed
without
a
doubt
woodgate
had
more
work
to
restrain
now
her
tears
for
rachel
and
now
her
consuming
indignation
with
the
absentees
your
wife
feels
it
as
much
as
mine
said
steel
to
the
vicar
when
the
gentlemen
were
alone
at
last
and
one
of
them
could
have
struck
him
for
the
speech
one
who
had
insight
and
could
feel
himself
i
would
go
so
far
as
that
the
good
vicar
rejoined
but
morna
feels
it
dreadfully
dreadfully
she
feels
it
i
almost
wish
we
had
kept
the
table
as
it
was
pursued
steel
over
his
cigar
and
had
one
of
those
photographs
taken
as
they
do
at
all
the
twopenny
banquets
nowadays
all
that
was
left
of
them
left
of
his
flippant
tone
made
langholm
writhe
and
drove
him
into
the
conversation
to
change
its
tenor
he
asked
by
whom
the
evil
had
come
surely
not
the
judge
no
said
steel
with
emphasis
not
that
i
have
it
for
a
fact
but
i
would
put
a
thousand
pounds
upon
his
charity
and
his
discretion
in
such
a
matter
a
kinder
and
a
sounder
man
does
not
exist
though
i
say
it
who
never
met
him
in
my
life
but
i
heard
every
word
of
my
wife
trial
and
i
know
the
way
the
judge
took
the
case
there
were
a
heap
of
women
witnesses
and
her
counsel
was
inclined
to
bully
them
it
was
delightful
to
see
the
fatherly
consideration
that
they
received
as
compensation
from
the
bench
langholm
breath
was
taken
away
here
was
an
end
to
the
likeliest
theory
that
he
had
evolved
that
morning
among
his
roses
steel
had
not
married
his
wife
in
ignorance
of
her
life
tragedy
he
had
been
present
and
probably
fallen
in
love
with
her
at
her
trial
then
why
did
he
never
behave
as
though
he
were
in
love
and
why
must
he
expatiate
upon
the
judge
kindness
to
the
female
witnesses
instead
of
on
the
grand
result
of
the
trial
over
which
he
had
presided
did
steel
himself
entertain
the
faintest
doubt
about
the
innocence
of
his
wife
whose
trial
he
had
heard
and
whom
he
had
married
thereafter
within
a
few
months
at
the
most
langholm
brain
buzzed
even
while
he
listened
to
what
hugh
woodgate
was
saying
i
am
not
surprised
remarked
the
vicar
i
remember
once
hearing
that
sir
baldwin
gibson
and
lord
edgeware
were
the
two
fairest
judges
on
the
bench
and
why
do
you
suppose
because
they
are
both
old
athletes
and
old
blues
trained
from
small
boys
to
give
their
opponents
every
possible
chance
steel
nodded
an
understanding
assent
langholm
however
who
was
better
qualified
to
appreciate
the
vicar
point
took
no
notice
of
it
if
it
was
not
the
judge
said
he
who
in
the
world
is
it
who
has
sprung
this
mine
i
saw
them
meet
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
guess
the
truth
but
i
had
special
reasons
i
had
thought
god
forgive
me
of
making
something
out
of
your
wife
case
steel
little
dreaming
it
was
hers
though
i
knew
it
had
no
ordinary
fascination
for
her
but
no
one
else
can
have
known
that
you
talked
it
over
with
her
however
and
steel
had
both
black
eyes
upon
the
novelist
who
made
his
innocent
admission
with
an
embarrassment
due
entirely
to
their
unnecessarily
piercing
scrutiny
you
talked
it
over
with
her
repeated
steel
this
time
in
dry
statement
of
fact
at
least
on
one
occasion
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
who
had
a
prior
claim
upon
your
conversation
that
lady
was
vinson
and
it
is
she
who
ought
to
have
a
millstone
hanged
about
her
neck
and
be
cast
into
the
sea
do
look
as
though
you
deserved
the
same
fate
langholm
it
would
have
been
better
perhaps
if
you
had
paid
more
attention
to
vinson
wife
and
less
to
mine
but
she
is
the
last
woman
in
the
world
to
blame
you
naturally
and
now
if
you
are
ready
we
will
join
them
woodgate
sensitive
as
all
his
tribe
and
himself
both
gentle
by
nature
and
considerate
of
others
according
to
his
lights
which
thoughtlessness
might
turn
down
or
passion
blur
but
which
burned
steadily
and
brightly
in
the
main
charles
langholm
felt
stung
to
the
soul
by
the
last
few
words
in
which
hugh
woodgate
noticed
nothing
amiss
steel
tone
was
not
openly
insulting
but
rather
that
of
banter
misplaced
perhaps
and
in
poor
taste
at
such
a
time
yet
ostensibly
and
innocent
of
ulterior
meaning
but
langholm
was
not
deceived
there
was
an
ulterior
meaning
to
him
and
a
very
unpleasant
one
withal
yet
he
did
not
feel
unjustifiably
insulted
he
looked
within
and
felt
justly
rebuked
not
for
anything
he
had
said
or
done
but
for
what
he
found
in
his
heart
at
that
moment
langholm
entered
the
in
profound
depression
but
his
state
of
mind
was
no
longer
due
to
anything
that
had
just
been
said
the
scene
awaiting
him
was
surely
calculated
to
deepen
that
dejection
rachel
had
left
the
gentlemen
with
the
proud
mien
and
the
unbroken
spirit
which
she
had
maintained
at
table
without
trace
of
effort
they
found
her
sobbing
on
morna
woodgate
shoulder
in
distress
so
poignant
and
so
pitiful
that
even
steel
stopped
short
upon
the
threshold
in
an
instant
she
was
on
her
feet
the
tears
still
thick
in
her
noble
eyes
but
the
spirit
once
more
alight
behind
the
tears
do
go
she
begged
them
in
a
voice
that
pierced
one
heart
at
least
stop
and
help
me
for
god
sake
i
ca
bear
it
i
am
not
strong
enough
i
can
only
pretend
to
bear
it
for
an
hour
before
the
servants
even
that
has
almost
maddened
me
the
effort
and
the
shame
the
shame
is
on
others
said
steel
gravely
enough
now
and
not
on
you
and
who
are
those
others
i
should
like
to
know
and
what
does
it
matter
what
they
think
or
say
a
district
like
this
is
not
the
world
rachel
shook
her
head
sadly
her
beautiful
eyes
were
dry
now
and
only
the
more
lustrous
for
the
tears
that
they
had
shed
langholm
saw
nothing
else
but
it
is
the
world
she
asserted
it
is
part
of
the
world
and
the
same
thing
would
happen
in
any
other
part
it
would
happen
in
london
and
everywhere
else
as
soon
as
i
became
known
and
henceforth
i
mean
to
be
known
cried
rachel
wilfully
there
shall
be
no
more
hiding
who
i
was
or
am
that
is
the
way
to
make
them
think
the
worst
when
they
find
out
but
is
it
not
disgraceful
i
was
acquitted
and
yet
i
am
to
be
treated
as
though
i
had
been
merely
pardoned
is
that
not
a
disgrace
to
common
humanity
humanity
is
not
so
common
as
you
imagine
remarked
steel
it
is
cried
hugh
woodgate
with
many
repetitions
of
the
epithet
langholm
said
nothing
his
eyes
never
left
rachel
face
neither
did
she
meet
them
for
an
instant
nor
had
she
a
look
for
hugh
woodgate
or
even
for
his
wife
it
was
to
her
husband
that
rachel
had
spoken
every
word
it
was
nearest
him
she
stood
in
his
face
only
that
she
gazed
are
you
going
to
let
the
disgrace
continue
she
asked
him
fiercely
his
answer
was
natural
enough
my
dear
rachel
what
can
i
do
i
never
dreamt
that
it
would
come
out
here
it
is
by
the
merest
fluke
that
it
did
but
i
want
it
to
come
out
cried
rachel
if
you
mean
the
fact
of
my
trial
and
my
acquittal
it
was
a
mistake
ever
to
hide
either
for
a
moment
henceforth
they
shall
be
no
secret
then
we
can
not
prevent
the
world
from
thinking
and
saying
what
it
likes
however
uncharitable
and
unjust
do
be
reasonable
and
listen
to
reason
though
god
knows
you
can
be
in
no
mood
for
such
cold
comfort
but
i
have
done
my
best
i
will
do
my
best
again
i
will
sell
this
place
we
will
go
right
away
somewhere
else
and
then
the
same
thing
will
happen
there
is
that
all
you
can
suggest
you
who
married
me
after
hearing
with
your
own
ears
every
scrap
of
evidence
that
they
could
bring
against
me
have
you
anything
better
to
suggest
yourself
rachel
i
have
she
answered
looking
him
full
and
sternly
in
the
face
in
the
now
forgotten
presence
of
their
three
guests
find
out
who
guilty
if
you
really
want
people
to
believe
that
i
am
not
steel
did
not
start
though
there
came
a
day
when
one
at
least
of
the
listening
trio
felt
honestly
persuaded
that
he
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
lips
came
more
closely
together
while
his
eyes
searched
those
of
his
wife
with
a
wider
stare
than
was
often
seen
in
them
but
for
two
or
three
seconds
at
most
before
dropping
in
perplexity
to
the
floor
how
can
i
rachel
her
husband
asked
quietly
indeed
gently
yet
with
little
promise
of
acquiescence
in
his
tone
i
am
not
a
detective
after
all
but
that
was
added
for
the
sake
of
adding
something
and
was
enough
to
prove
steel
ill
at
ease
to
the
wife
who
knew
him
as
no
man
ever
had
a
detective
no
said
she
readily
enough
but
you
are
a
rich
man
you
could
employ
detectives
you
could
clear
your
wife
if
you
liked
rachel
you
know
very
well
that
you
are
cleared
already
that
is
your
answer
then
she
cried
scornfully
and
snatched
her
eyes
from
him
at
last
without
waiting
for
a
denial
she
was
done
with
him
her
face
said
plainly
he
looked
at
her
a
moment
then
turned
aside
with
a
shrug
but
rachel
eyes
went
swiftly
round
the
room
they
alighted
for
an
instant
upon
morna
woodgate
leaning
forward
upon
the
sofa
where
they
had
sat
together
eager
enthusiastic
but
impotent
as
a
woman
must
be
they
passed
over
the
vicar
looking
stolid
as
usual
and
more
than
a
little
puzzled
but
at
last
they
rested
on
langholm
thin
stooping
figure
with
untidy
head
thrust
forward
towards
her
and
a
light
in
his
dreamy
eyes
that
kindled
a
new
light
in
her
own
you
mr
langholm
cried
rachel
taking
a
quick
short
step
in
his
direction
you
with
your
plots
and
your
problems
that
nobody
can
solve
do
you
think
you
could
unravel
this
one
for
me
her
eyes
were
radiant
now
and
their
radiance
all
for
him
langholm
felt
the
heart
swimming
in
his
body
the
brain
in
his
head
a
couple
of
strides
to
meet
her
of
the
way
and
he
had
taken
rachel
hand
before
her
husband
and
her
friends
before
god
said
langholm
i
try
their
hands
met
only
to
part
there
was
a
sardonic
laugh
from
husband
do
you
forbid
me
demanded
langholm
turning
upon
him
far
from
it
said
steel
i
shall
be
most
interested
to
see
you
go
to
work
is
that
a
challenge
the
two
men
faced
each
other
while
the
third
man
and
the
women
looked
on
it
had
sounded
like
a
challenge
to
all
but
the
vicar
though
neither
of
the
others
had
had
time
to
think
so
before
they
heard
the
word
and
recognized
its
justice
if
you
like
said
steel
indifferently
i
accept
it
as
such
rejoined
langholm
dogging
the
other
with
his
eyes
and
find
him
i
will
the
guilty
man
if
i
never
write
another
line
and
if
the
villain
is
still
alive
chapter
xx
more
haste
there
are
eminent
men
of
action
who
can
acquit
themselves
with
equal
credit
upon
the
little
field
of
letters
as
some
of
the
very
best
books
of
late
years
go
to
prove
the
man
of
letters
on
the
other
hand
capable
of
cutting
a
respectable
figure
in
action
is
one
fears
a
much
rarer
type
langholm
was
essentially
a
man
of
letters
he
was
at
his
best
among
his
roses
and
his
books
at
his
worst
in
unforeseen
collision
with
the
rougher
realities
of
life
but
give
him
time
and
he
was
not
the
man
to
run
away
because
his
equipment
for
battle
was
as
short
as
his
confidence
in
himself
and
perhaps
such
courage
as
he
possessed
was
not
less
courageous
for
the
crust
of
cowardice
mostly
moral
through
which
it
always
had
to
break
langholm
had
one
other
qualification
for
the
quest
to
which
he
had
committed
himself
but
for
which
he
was
as
thoroughly
unsuited
by
temperament
as
by
the
whole
tenor
of
his
solitary
life
in
addition
to
an
ingenious
imagination
a
quality
with
its
own
defects
as
the
sequel
will
show
he
had
that
capacity
for
taking
pains
which
has
no
disadvantageous
side
though
in
langholm
case
for
one
it
was
certainly
not
a
synonym
for
genius
it
was
on
the
monday
afternoon
when
he
alighted
at
king
cross
having
caught
the
from
northborough
after
an
early
adieu
to
william
allen
richardson
and
the
rest
langholm
made
sure
of
the
time
before
getting
into
his
hansom
at
the
terminus
drive
hard
he
said
to
the
capital
and
counties
bank
in
oxford
street
and
he
was
there
some
minutes
before
the
hour
i
want
to
know
my
exact
balance
if
it
is
not
too
much
trouble
to
look
it
up
before
you
close
a
slip
of
paper
was
soon
put
into
langholm
hand
and
at
a
glance
he
flushed
to
the
hat
with
pleasure
and
surprise
and
so
regained
his
cab
the
cadogan
hotel
in
sloane
street
he
cried
through
the
trap
and
there
no
hurry
you
can
go
your
own
pace
nor
was
there
any
further
anxiety
in
langholm
heart
his
balance
was
a
clear
hundred
more
than
he
had
expected
to
find
it
and
his
whole
soul
sang
the
praises
of
a
country
life
unbusinesslike
and
unmethodical
as
he
was
in
everything
but
the
preparation
of
such
a
discovery
could
never
have
been
made
in
town
where
langholm
expenditure
had
marched
with
his
modest
earnings
and
it
can
again
he
said
recklessly
to
himself
as
he
decided
on
the
best
hotel
in
the
field
of
his
investigations
instead
of
lodgings
thank
god
i
have
enough
to
run
this
racket
till
the
end
of
the
year
at
least
if
i
ca
strike
the
trail
by
then
he
lapsed
into
dear
reminiscence
and
dearer
daydreams
their
common
scene
some
two
hundred
miles
north
but
to
realize
his
lapse
was
to
recover
from
it
promptly
langholm
glanced
at
himself
in
the
little
mirror
his
was
an
honest
face
and
it
was
an
honest
part
that
he
must
play
or
none
at
all
he
leaned
over
the
apron
and
interested
himself
in
the
london
life
that
was
so
familiar
to
him
still
it
was
as
though
he
had
not
been
absent
above
a
day
yet
his
perceptions
were
sharpened
by
his
very
absence
of
so
many
weeks
the
wood
pavement
gave
off
a
strong
but
not
unpleasant
scent
in
the
heavy
august
heat
it
was
positively
dear
to
the
old
londoner
nostrils
the
further
he
drove
upon
his
southwesterly
course
the
emptier
were
the
thoroughfares
james
street
might
have
been
closed
to
traffic
the
clubs
in
pall
mall
were
mostly
shut
on
the
footways
strolled
the
folk
whom
one
only
sees
there
in
august
and
september
the
entire
families
from
the
country
the
less
affluent
american
guide
book
in
hand
here
and
there
was
a
perennial
type
the
pale
actor
with
soft
hat
and
chin
the
ragged
sloucher
from
park
to
park
langholm
could
have
foregathered
with
one
and
all
such
was
the
strange
fascination
of
the
town
for
one
who
was
twice
the
man
among
his
northern
roses
but
that
is
the
kind
of
mistress
that
london
is
to
those
who
have
once
felt
her
spell
you
may
forget
her
by
the
year
but
the
spell
lies
lurking
in
the
first
whiff
of
the
wood
pavement
the
first
flutter
of
the
evening
paper
on
the
curb
and
even
in
the
cab
you
wonder
how
you
have
borne
existence
elsewhere
the
hotel
was
very
empty
and
langholm
found
not
only
the
best
of
rooms
at
his
disposal
but
that
flattering
quality
of
attention
which
awaits
the
first
comer
when
few
come
at
all
he
refreshed
himself
with
tea
and
a
bath
and
then
set
out
to
reconnoitre
the
scene
of
the
already
murder
he
had
a
vague
though
sanguine
notion
that
his
imaginative
intuition
might
at
once
perceive
some
possibility
which
had
never
dawned
upon
the
academic
intelligence
of
the
police
of
course
he
remembered
the
name
of
the
street
and
it
was
easily
found
nor
had
langholm
any
difficulty
in
discovering
the
house
though
he
had
forgotten
the
number
there
were
very
few
houses
in
the
street
and
only
one
of
them
was
empty
and
to
let
it
was
plastered
with
the
bills
of
various
agents
and
langholm
noted
down
the
nearest
of
these
whose
office
was
in
king
road
he
would
get
an
order
to
view
the
house
and
would
explore
every
inch
of
it
that
very
night
but
his
bath
and
his
tea
had
made
away
with
the
greater
part
of
an
hour
it
was
six
before
langholm
reached
the
and
the
office
was
already
shut
he
dined
quietly
at
his
hotel
feeling
none
the
less
that
he
had
made
a
beginning
and
spent
the
evening
looking
up
chelsea
friends
who
were
likely
to
be
more
conversant
than
himself
with
all
the
circumstances
of
minchin
murder
and
his
wife
arrest
but
who
as
might
have
been
expected
were
one
and
all
from
home
in
the
morning
the
order
of
his
plans
were
somewhat
altered
it
was
essential
that
he
should
have
those
circumstances
at
his
fingers
ends
at
least
so
far
as
they
had
transpired
in
open
court
langholm
had
read
the
trial
at
the
time
with
the
inquisitive
but
impersonal
interest
which
such
a
case
inspires
in
the
average
man
now
he
must
study
it
in
a
very
different
spirit
and
for
the
nonce
he
repaired
betimes
to
the
newspaper
room
at
the
british
museum
by
midday
he
had
mastered
most
details
of
the
complex
case
and
made
a
note
of
every
name
and
address
which
had
found
their
way
into
the
newspaper
reports
but
there
was
one
name
which
did
not
appear
in
any
account
langholm
sought
it
in
bound
volume
after
bound
volume
until
even
the
attendants
who
trundle
the
great
tomes
from
their
shelves
on
trolleys
looked
askance
at
the
wanton
reader
who
filled
in
a
new
form
every
five
or
ten
minutes
but
the
reader
face
shone
with
a
brighter
light
at
each
fresh
failure
why
had
the
name
he
wanted
never
come
up
in
open
court
where
was
the
evidence
of
the
man
who
had
made
all
the
mischief
between
the
minchins
langholm
intended
having
first
the
one
and
then
the
other
already
he
was
on
the
spring
to
a
first
conclusion
with
a
caution
however
which
did
infinite
credit
to
one
of
his
temperament
the
amateur
detective
determined
to
look
a
little
further
before
leaping
even
in
his
own
mind
early
in
the
afternoon
he
was
back
in
chelsea
making
fraudulent
representations
to
the
near
the
vestry
hall
not
more
than
ninety
repeated
that
gentleman
as
he
went
through
his
book
and
read
out
particulars
of
several
houses
at
about
that
rental
but
the
house
which
langholm
burned
to
see
over
was
not
among
the
number
i
want
a
quiet
street
said
the
wily
writer
and
named
the
one
in
which
it
stood
have
you
nothing
there
i
have
one
said
the
agent
with
reserve
and
it
only
seventy
the
less
the
better
cried
langholm
i
should
like
to
see
that
one
the
hesitated
finally
looking
langholm
in
the
face
you
may
as
well
know
first
as
last
said
he
for
we
have
had
enough
trouble
about
that
house
it
was
let
last
year
for
ninety
we
asking
seventy
because
it
is
the
house
in
which
minchin
was
shot
dead
still
want
to
see
it
inquired
the
with
a
wry
smile
it
was
all
langholm
could
do
to
conceal
his
eagerness
but
in
the
end
he
escaped
with
several
orders
to
view
and
the
keys
of
the
house
of
houses
in
his
pocket
no
caretaker
could
be
got
to
live
in
it
the
agent
seemed
at
langholm
readiness
to
see
over
it
all
alone
about
an
hour
later
the
novelist
stood
at
a
door
whose
name
and
number
were
not
inscribed
upon
any
of
the
orders
obtained
by
fraud
from
the
king
road
agent
it
was
a
door
that
needed
painting
and
there
was
a
conspicuous
card
in
the
window
langholm
tugged
twice
in
his
impatience
at
the
bell
if
his
face
had
been
alight
before
it
was
now
on
fire
for
by
deliberate
steps
he
had
arrived
at
the
very
conclusion
to
which
he
had
been
inclined
to
jump
at
last
came
a
slut
of
the
imperishable
type
is
your
mistress
in
no
when
do
you
expect
her
not
before
night
any
idea
what
time
of
night
the
untidy
child
had
none
but
at
length
admitted
that
she
had
orders
to
keep
the
fire
in
for
the
landlady
supper
langholm
drew
his
own
deduction
it
would
be
little
use
in
returning
before
nine
five
hours
to
wait
he
made
one
more
cast
before
he
went
have
you
been
here
long
my
girl
going
on
three
months
but
your
mistress
has
been
here
some
years
i
believe
so
are
you
her
only
servant
yes
and
five
hours
to
wait
for
more
it
seemed
an
infinity
to
langholm
as
he
turned
away
but
at
all
events
the
house
had
not
changed
hands
the
woman
he
would
eventually
see
was
the
woman
who
had
given
invaluable
evidence
at
the
old
bailey
chapter
xxi
worse
speed
langholm
returned
to
his
hotel
and
wrote
a
few
lines
to
rachel
it
had
been
arranged
that
he
was
to
report
progress
direct
to
her
and
as
often
as
possible
but
it
was
a
very
open
arrangement
in
which
steel
had
sardonically
concurred
yet
little
as
there
was
to
say
and
for
all
his
practice
with
the
pen
it
took
langholm
the
best
part
of
an
hour
to
write
that
he
believed
he
had
already
obtained
a
most
important
clew
which
the
police
had
missed
in
the
most
incredible
manner
though
it
had
been
under
their
noses
all
the
time
so
incredible
did
it
appear
however
even
to
himself
when
written
down
that
langholm
decided
not
to
post
this
letter
until
after
his
interview
with
the
chelsea
landlady
to
kill
the
interval
he
went
for
his
dinner
to
the
single
club
to
which
he
still
belonged
it
was
a
bohemian
establishment
off
the
strand
and
its
name
was
the
best
thing
about
it
in
this
member
eyes
he
was
soon
cursing
himself
for
coming
near
the
place
while
engaged
upon
his
great
and
sacred
quest
not
a
clubable
person
himself
as
that
epithet
was
understood
in
this
its
home
langholm
was
not
a
little
surprised
when
men
most
of
whom
he
barely
knew
rose
to
greet
him
on
his
appearance
in
the
but
even
with
their
greetings
came
the
explanation
to
fill
the
newcomer
with
a
horror
too
sudden
for
concealment
it
appeared
that
steel
identity
with
the
whilom
minchin
had
not
only
leaked
out
in
delverton
langholm
gathered
that
it
was
actually
in
one
of
that
morning
papers
at
which
he
had
not
found
time
to
glance
in
his
ardor
for
the
chase
for
the
moment
he
was
shocked
beyond
words
and
not
a
little
disgusted
to
discover
the
cause
of
his
own
temporary
importance
talk
of
the
devil
cried
a
comparative
crony
i
was
just
telling
them
that
you
must
be
the
novelist
in
the
case
as
your
cottage
was
somewhere
down
there
have
you
really
seen
anything
of
the
lady
seen
anything
of
her
echoed
a
journalist
to
whom
langholm
had
never
spoken
in
his
life
why
ca
you
see
that
he
bowled
her
out
himself
and
came
up
straight
to
sell
the
news
langholm
took
his
comparative
crony
by
the
arm
come
in
and
dine
with
me
he
said
i
ca
stand
this
yes
yes
i
know
her
well
he
whispered
as
they
went
round
the
screen
which
was
the
only
partition
between
pipes
and
plates
but
let
me
see
what
that
scurrilous
rag
has
to
say
while
you
order
i
do
the
rest
and
you
had
better
make
it
a
bottle
of
champagne
the
scurrilous
rag
had
less
to
say
than
langholm
had
been
led
to
expect
he
breathed
again
when
he
had
read
the
sequence
of
short
but
pithy
paragraphs
minchin
new
name
was
not
given
after
all
nor
that
of
her
adopted
district
while
langholm
himself
only
slunk
into
print
as
a
novelist
who
oddly
enough
was
among
the
guests
and
of
a
situation
after
his
own
heart
the
district
might
have
been
any
one
of
the
many
manufacturing
centres
in
the
largest
of
shires
which
was
the
one
geographical
clew
vouchsafed
by
the
paper
langholm
began
to
regret
his
readiness
to
admit
the
impeachment
with
which
he
had
been
saluted
it
was
only
in
his
own
club
that
he
would
have
been
pounced
upon
as
the
novelist
but
it
was
some
comfort
to
reflect
that
even
in
his
own
club
his
exact
address
was
not
known
for
his
solicitor
paid
his
subscription
and
sent
periodically
for
his
letters
charles
langholm
had
not
set
up
as
hermit
by
halves
he
had
his
own
reasons
for
being
thorough
there
and
it
was
more
inspiriting
than
the
champagne
to
feel
that
no
fresh
annoyance
was
likely
to
befall
the
steels
through
him
it
not
so
bad
as
i
thought
said
langholm
throwing
the
newspaper
aside
as
his
companion
whose
professional
name
was
valentine
venn
finished
with
the
dear
boy
said
venn
it
took
a
pal
to
spot
you
alone
i
did
it
but
i
wish
you
were
so
dark
about
that
confounded
cottage
of
yours
the
humble
mummer
would
fain
gather
the
crumbs
that
fall
from
the
rich
scribe
table
especially
when
he
out
of
a
shop
which
is
the
present
condition
of
affairs
besides
we
might
collaborate
in
a
play
and
make
more
money
apiece
in
three
weeks
than
either
of
us
earns
in
a
fat
year
that
little
story
of
yours
never
mind
my
little
stories
said
langholm
hastily
i
just
finished
a
long
one
and
the
very
thought
of
fiction
makes
me
sick
well
you
got
facts
to
turn
to
for
a
change
and
for
once
they
really
do
seem
as
strange
as
the
other
thing
lucky
bargee
have
you
had
her
under
the
microscope
all
the
summer
ye
gods
what
a
part
of
drink
up
said
langholm
grimly
as
the
champagne
made
an
opportune
appearance
and
now
tell
me
who
that
fellow
is
who
opening
the
piano
and
since
when
you
started
a
musical
dinner
the
big
room
that
the
screen
divided
had
a
grand
piano
in
the
dining
half
for
use
upon
those
saturday
evenings
for
which
the
old
club
was
still
famous
but
rarely
touched
during
the
working
days
of
the
week
yet
even
now
a
dark
and
cadaverous
young
man
was
raising
the
top
of
the
piano
slowly
and
laboriously
as
though
it
were
too
heavy
for
him
valentine
venn
looked
over
his
shoulder
good
god
said
he
another
fact
worth
most
folks
fiction
another
coincidence
you
would
dare
to
use
why
who
is
it
venn
answer
was
to
hail
the
dark
thin
youth
with
rude
geniality
the
young
fellow
hesitated
almost
shrank
but
came
shyly
forward
in
the
end
langholm
noted
that
he
looked
very
ill
that
his
face
was
as
sensitive
as
it
was
thin
and
pale
but
his
expression
singularly
sweet
and
pleasing
severino
said
venn
with
a
pomp
let
me
introduce
you
to
charles
langholm
the
celebrated
novelist
not
to
know
is
to
argue
yourself
unknown
which
is
the
champion
of
literature
added
langholm
with
literary
arrogance
as
he
took
the
lad
hand
cordially
in
his
own
only
to
release
it
hurriedly
before
he
crushed
such
slender
fingers
to
their
hurt
langholm
pursued
venn
is
the
hero
of
that
paragraph
langholm
kicked
him
under
the
table
that
that
paragraph
about
his
last
book
you
know
severino
langholm
is
the
best
pianist
we
have
had
in
the
club
since
i
have
been
a
member
and
you
will
say
the
same
yourself
in
another
minute
he
always
plays
to
us
when
he
drops
in
to
dine
and
you
may
think
yourself
lucky
that
he
has
dropped
in
but
where
does
the
coincidence
come
in
asked
langholm
as
the
young
fellow
returned
to
the
piano
with
a
rather
sad
shake
of
the
head
what
cried
venn
below
his
breath
do
you
mean
to
say
you
are
a
friend
of
minchin
or
whatever
her
name
is
now
and
that
you
never
heard
of
severino
no
replied
langholm
his
heart
in
an
instantaneous
flutter
who
is
he
the
man
she
wanted
to
nurse
the
night
her
husband
was
murdered
the
cause
of
the
final
row
between
them
his
name
was
kept
out
of
the
papers
but
that
the
man
langholm
sat
back
in
his
chair
to
have
spent
a
summer
day
in
stolid
search
for
traces
of
this
man
only
to
be
introduced
to
the
man
himself
by
purest
chance
in
the
evening
it
was
indeed
difficult
to
believe
nor
was
persuasion
on
the
point
followed
by
the
proper
degree
of
gratitude
in
langholm
for
a
transcendent
stroke
of
fortune
in
fact
he
almost
resented
his
luck
he
would
so
much
rather
have
stood
indebted
to
his
skill
and
there
were
other
causes
for
disappointment
as
in
an
instant
there
were
things
more
incredible
to
langholm
than
the
everyday
coincidence
of
a
chance
meeting
with
the
one
person
whom
one
desires
to
meet
so
that
the
man
he
echoed
in
a
tone
that
might
have
told
his
companion
something
only
the
fingers
which
langholm
had
feared
to
crush
had
already
fallen
upon
the
keys
with
the
strong
tender
unerring
touch
of
a
master
and
the
impressionable
player
was
swaying
with
enthusiasm
on
his
stool
and
ca
he
play
whispered
valentine
venn
as
though
it
were
the
man
playing
alone
that
they
were
discussing
yet
even
the
preoccupied
novelist
had
to
listen
and
nod
and
then
listen
again
before
replying
he
can
said
langholm
at
length
but
why
was
it
that
they
took
such
pains
to
keep
his
name
out
of
the
case
they
did
it
would
have
done
no
good
to
drag
him
in
the
poor
devil
was
at
death
door
at
the
time
of
the
murder
but
is
that
a
fact
venn
opened
his
eyes
supposing
continued
langholm
speaking
the
thing
that
was
not
in
his
mind
with
the
deplorable
facility
of
the
professional
supposing
that
illness
had
been
a
sham
and
they
had
really
meant
to
elope
under
cover
of
it
well
it
was
i
dare
say
not
but
how
do
you
know
they
ought
to
have
put
him
in
the
box
and
had
his
evidence
he
was
still
too
ill
to
be
called
rejoined
venn
but
i
take
you
at
your
word
dear
boy
and
tell
you
exactly
how
i
do
know
all
about
his
illness
you
see
that
dark
chap
with
the
cigar
who
just
come
in
to
listen
that
severino
doctor
it
was
he
who
put
him
up
here
and
i
introduce
you
to
him
if
you
like
after
dinner
thank
you
said
langholm
after
some
little
hesitation
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
should
like
it
very
much
venn
he
added
leaning
right
across
the
little
table
i
know
the
woman
well
i
believe
in
her
absolutely
on
every
point
and
i
mean
to
make
her
neighbors
and
mine
do
the
same
that
is
my
object
do
give
it
away
dear
boy
these
lips
are
sealed
said
valentine
venn
but
a
very
little
conversation
with
the
doctor
sufficed
to
satisfy
langholm
curiosity
and
to
remove
from
his
mind
the
wild
prepossession
which
he
had
allowed
to
grow
upon
it
with
every
hour
of
that
wasted
day
the
doctor
was
also
one
of
the
bohemian
colony
in
chelsea
and
by
no
means
loath
to
talk
about
a
tragedy
of
which
he
had
exceptional
knowledge
since
he
himself
had
been
one
of
the
medical
witnesses
at
each
successive
stage
of
the
investigations
he
had
also
heard
on
the
other
side
of
the
screen
that
langholm
was
the
novelist
referred
to
in
a
paragraph
which
had
of
course
had
a
special
interest
for
him
and
as
was
only
fair
langholm
was
interrogated
in
his
turn
what
was
less
fair
and
indeed
ungrateful
in
a
marked
degree
was
the
way
in
which
the
original
questioner
parried
all
questions
put
to
himself
and
he
very
soon
left
the
club
on
his
way
out
he
went
into
the
and
tearing
into
little
pieces
a
letter
which
he
had
written
that
afternoon
left
the
fragments
behind
him
in
the
basket
his
exit
from
the
room
was
meanwhile
producing
its
sequel
in
a
little
incident
which
would
have
astonished
langholm
considerably
severino
had
been
playing
for
nearly
an
hour
on
end
had
seemed
thoroughly
engrossed
in
his
own
fascinating
performance
and
quite
oblivious
of
the
dining
and
smoking
going
on
around
him
according
to
the
accepted
ease
and
freedom
of
the
club
yet
no
sooner
was
langholm
gone
than
the
pianist
broke
off
abruptly
and
joined
the
group
which
the
other
had
deserted
who
is
that
fellow
said
severino
in
english
so
perfect
that
the
slight
italian
accent
only
added
a
charm
to
his
gentle
voice
i
did
not
catch
the
name
it
was
repeated
with
such
additions
as
may
be
fairly
made
behind
a
man
back
a
dashed
good
fellow
who
writes
dashed
bad
novels
was
one
of
these
you
forget
said
another
he
is
the
novelist
who
is
going
the
rounds
as
a
neighbor
and
friend
of
looks
from
venn
and
the
doctor
cut
short
the
speech
but
not
before
its
import
had
come
home
to
the
young
italian
whose
hollow
cheeks
flushed
a
dusky
brown
while
his
sunken
eyes
caught
fire
in
an
instant
he
was
on
his
feet
with
no
attempt
to
hide
his
excitement
and
still
less
to
mask
the
emotion
that
was
its
real
name
he
knows
her
do
you
tell
me
he
knows
minchin
or
whatever
her
name
is
now
yes
so
he
says
and
what
is
her
name
he
wo
say
nor
where
she
lives
no
then
where
does
he
live
none
of
us
know
that
either
he
the
darkest
horse
in
the
club
venn
agreed
with
this
speaker
some
little
bitterness
in
his
tone
another
stood
up
for
langholm
we
should
be
as
dark
said
he
if
we
had
married
gayety
choristers
and
they
had
left
us
and
we
went
in
dread
of
their
return
they
sum
up
the
life
tragedies
pretty
pithily
in
these
clubs
he
was
always
a
silly
ass
about
women
rejoined
langholm
critic
summing
up
the
man
so
it
minchin
now
the
name
acted
like
magic
upon
young
severino
his
attention
had
wandered
in
an
instant
it
was
more
eager
than
before
if
you
do
know
where
he
lives
in
the
country
he
burst
out
where
is
he
staying
in
town
we
do
know
that
either
then
i
mean
to
find
out
and
the
pale
musician
rushed
from
the
room
in
pursuit
of
the
man
who
had
been
all
day
pursuing
him
chapter
xxii
the
darkest
hour
the
amateur
detective
walked
slowly
up
to
piccadilly
and
climbed
on
top
of
a
chelsea
omnibus
a
dejected
figure
even
to
the
casual
eye
he
was
more
than
disappointed
at
the
upshot
of
his
wild
speculations
and
in
himself
for
the
false
start
that
he
had
made
his
feeling
was
one
of
positive
shame
it
was
so
easy
now
to
see
the
glaring
improbability
of
the
conclusion
to
which
he
had
jumped
in
his
haste
at
the
first
promptings
of
a
too
facile
fancy
and
what
an
obvious
idea
it
had
been
at
last
as
if
his
were
the
only
brain
to
which
it
could
have
occurred
langholm
could
have
laughed
at
his
late
theory
if
it
had
only
entailed
the
loss
of
one
day
but
it
had
also
cost
him
that
which
was
the
more
valuable
in
his
case
through
not
being
a
common
characteristic
of
the
man
he
now
realized
the
difficulties
of
his
quest
and
the
absolutely
wrong
way
in
which
he
had
set
about
it
his
imagination
had
run
away
with
him
it
was
no
case
for
the
imagination
it
was
a
case
for
patient
investigation
close
reasoning
logical
deduction
all
arts
in
which
the
imaginative
man
is
almost
inevitably
deficient
langholm
however
had
enough
lightness
of
temperament
to
abandon
an
idea
as
readily
as
he
formed
one
and
his
late
suspicion
was
already
driven
to
the
four
winds
he
only
hoped
he
had
not
shown
what
was
in
his
mind
at
the
club
langholm
was
a
just
man
and
he
honestly
regretted
the
injustice
that
he
had
done
even
in
his
own
heart
and
for
ever
so
few
hours
to
a
thoroughly
innocent
man
and
all
up
piccadilly
this
man
was
sitting
within
a
few
inches
of
him
watching
his
face
with
a
passionate
envy
and
plucking
up
courage
to
speak
he
only
did
so
at
hyde
park
corner
where
an
intervening
passenger
got
down
langholm
was
sufficiently
startled
at
the
sound
of
his
own
name
breaking
in
upon
the
reflections
indicated
but
to
find
at
his
elbow
the
very
face
which
was
in
his
mind
was
to
lose
all
power
of
immediate
reply
my
name
is
severino
explained
the
other
i
was
introduced
to
you
an
hour
or
two
ago
at
the
club
ah
to
be
sure
cried
langholm
recovering
odd
thing
though
for
we
must
have
left
about
the
same
time
and
i
never
saw
you
till
this
moment
severino
took
the
vacant
place
by
langholm
side
langholm
said
he
a
tremor
in
his
soft
voice
i
have
a
confession
to
make
to
you
i
followed
you
from
the
club
followed
langholm
could
not
help
the
double
emphasis
to
him
it
seemed
a
grotesque
turning
of
the
tables
a
too
poetically
just
ending
to
that
misspent
day
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
repress
a
smile
yes
i
followed
you
the
young
italian
repeated
with
his
taking
accent
in
his
touching
voice
and
i
beg
your
pardon
for
doing
so
though
i
would
do
the
same
again
i
will
tell
you
why
i
thought
that
you
were
talking
about
me
while
i
was
strumming
to
them
at
the
club
it
is
possible
of
course
that
i
was
quite
mistaken
but
when
you
went
out
i
stopped
at
once
and
asked
questions
and
they
told
me
you
were
a
friend
of
a
great
friend
of
mine
of
mrs
minchin
it
is
true
enough
said
langholm
after
a
pause
well
she
was
a
very
great
friend
of
mine
repeated
severino
that
was
all
and
he
sighed
so
i
have
heard
said
langholm
with
sympathy
i
can
well
believe
it
for
i
might
almost
say
the
same
of
her
myself
the
toiled
on
beside
the
park
the
two
long
lines
of
lights
rose
gently
ahead
until
they
almost
met
and
the
two
men
watched
them
as
they
spoke
until
continued
severino
i
did
not
know
whether
she
was
dead
or
alive
she
is
both
alive
and
well
and
married
again
and
married
again
there
was
a
long
pause
the
park
ended
first
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
great
favor
said
severino
in
knightsbridge
she
was
so
good
to
me
i
shall
never
forget
it
and
yet
i
have
never
been
able
to
thank
her
i
nearly
died
it
was
at
that
time
and
when
i
remembered
she
had
disappeared
i
beg
and
beseech
you
langholm
to
tell
me
her
name
and
where
she
is
living
now
langholm
looked
at
his
companion
in
the
confluence
of
lights
at
the
sloane
street
corner
the
pale
face
was
alight
with
passion
the
sunken
eyes
ablaze
i
can
not
tell
you
he
answered
shortly
is
it
your
own
name
good
god
no
and
langholm
laughed
harshly
will
you
not
even
tell
me
where
she
lives
i
can
not
without
her
leave
but
if
you
like
i
will
tell
her
about
you
there
was
no
answer
as
they
drove
on
then
of
a
sudden
langholm
arm
was
seized
and
crushed
by
bony
fingers
i
am
dying
the
low
voice
whispered
hoarsely
in
his
ear
ca
you
see
it
for
yourself
i
shall
never
get
better
it
might
be
a
year
or
two
it
may
be
weeks
but
i
want
to
see
her
again
and
make
sure
yes
i
love
her
there
is
no
sense
in
denying
it
but
it
is
all
on
my
side
and
i
am
dying
and
she
has
married
again
what
harm
can
it
do
anybody
if
i
see
her
once
more
the
sunken
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
there
were
more
tears
in
the
hollow
voice
langholm
was
deeply
touched
my
dear
fellow
he
said
i
will
let
her
know
no
no
not
that
of
course
but
i
will
write
to
her
at
once
will
that
not
do
severino
thanked
him
with
a
heavy
sigh
oh
do
get
down
he
added
as
langholm
rose
i
wo
talk
about
her
any
more
i
am
staying
in
this
street
explained
langholm
guardedly
and
these
are
my
lodgings
rejoined
the
other
pulling
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
handing
the
envelope
to
langholm
let
me
hear
from
you
for
pity
sake
as
soon
as
you
hear
from
her
langholm
sauntered
on
the
pavement
until
the
omnibus
which
he
had
left
was
no
longer
distinguishable
from
the
general
traffic
of
the
thoroughfare
the
address
on
the
envelope
was
that
of
the
at
which
he
was
to
have
called
that
night
he
was
glad
now
that
his
luck
had
not
left
him
to
find
severino
for
himself
the
sense
of
fatuity
would
have
been
even
keener
than
it
was
in
a
way
he
now
felt
drawn
to
the
poor
frank
boy
who
had
so
lately
been
the
object
of
his
unjust
and
unfounded
suspicions
there
was
a
new
light
in
which
to
think
of
him
a
new
bond
between
them
a
new
spring
of
sympathy
or
jealousy
if
not
of
both
but
langholm
was
not
in
london
to
show
sympathy
or
friendship
for
any
man
he
was
in
london
simply
and
solely
upon
his
own
great
quest
in
which
no
man
must
interrupt
him
that
was
why
he
had
been
so
guarded
about
his
whereabouts
though
not
guarded
enough
and
why
he
watched
the
omnibus
out
of
sight
before
entering
his
hotel
the
old
londoner
had
forgotten
how
few
places
there
are
at
which
one
can
stay
in
sloane
street
a
bad
hours
was
in
store
for
him
they
began
well
enough
with
the
unexpected
discovery
that
an
eminent
authority
on
crime
and
criminals
who
had
been
a
good
friend
to
langholm
in
his
london
days
was
still
in
town
the
novelist
went
round
to
his
house
that
night
chiefly
because
it
was
not
ten
minutes
walk
from
the
cadogan
hotel
and
with
little
hope
of
finding
anybody
at
home
yet
there
was
his
friend
with
the
midnight
lamp
just
lighted
and
so
kind
a
welcome
that
langholm
confided
in
him
on
the
spot
and
the
man
who
knew
all
the
detectives
in
london
did
not
laugh
at
the
latest
recruit
to
their
ranks
but
smile
he
did
i
tell
you
what
i
might
do
he
said
at
length
i
might
give
you
a
card
that
should
get
you
into
the
black
museum
at
new
scotland
yard
where
they
would
show
you
any
relics
they
may
have
kept
of
the
minchin
murder
only
do
say
why
you
want
to
see
them
every
man
you
see
there
will
be
a
detective
you
may
come
across
the
very
fellows
who
got
up
the
case
if
so
they
may
tell
you
what
they
think
of
it
and
you
should
be
able
to
find
out
whether
they
trying
again
here
you
are
langholm
and
i
wish
you
luck
doing
anything
night
langholm
could
safely
say
that
he
was
not
then
dine
with
me
at
the
rag
at
seven
and
tell
me
how
you
get
on
it
must
be
seven
because
i
off
to
scotland
by
the
night
mail
and
i
do
want
to
be
discouraging
my
dear
fellow
but
it
is
only
honest
to
say
that
i
think
more
of
your
chivalry
than
of
your
chances
of
success
at
the
black
museum
they
had
all
the
trophies
which
had
been
produced
in
court
but
the
officer
who
acted
as
showman
to
langholm
admitted
that
they
had
no
right
to
retain
any
of
them
they
were
property
and
if
they
knew
where
she
was
they
would
of
course
restore
everything
but
the
papers
say
she
is
minchin
any
longer
the
officer
added
well
well
there
no
accounting
for
taste
but
minchin
was
acquitted
remarked
langholm
in
tone
as
impersonal
as
he
could
make
it
drawled
his
guide
dryly
well
it
not
for
us
to
say
anything
about
that
but
you
think
all
the
more
i
suppose
there
only
one
opinion
about
it
in
the
yard
but
surely
you
have
given
up
trying
to
find
out
who
really
did
murder
mr
minchin
we
think
we
did
find
out
sir
was
the
reply
to
that
so
they
had
given
it
up
for
a
single
second
the
thought
was
stimulating
if
the
humble
author
could
succeed
where
the
police
had
failed
but
the
odds
against
such
success
were
probably
a
million
to
one
and
langholm
sighed
as
he
handled
the
weapon
with
which
the
crime
had
been
committed
in
the
opinion
of
the
police
what
makes
you
so
certain
that
this
was
the
revolver
he
inquired
more
to
satisfy
his
conscience
by
leaving
no
question
unasked
than
to
voice
any
doubt
upon
the
point
the
other
smiled
as
he
explained
the
peculiarity
of
the
pistol
it
had
been
made
in
melbourne
and
it
carried
the
bullet
of
peculiar
size
which
had
been
extracted
from
alexander
minchin
body
but
london
is
full
of
old
australians
objected
langholm
for
objection
sake
well
sir
laughed
the
officer
you
find
one
who
carries
a
revolver
like
this
and
prove
that
he
was
in
chelsea
on
the
night
of
the
murder
with
a
motive
for
committing
it
and
we
shall
be
glad
of
his
name
and
address
only
do
forget
the
motive
it
was
robbery
you
know
though
her
ladyship
was
so
sure
it
was
robbers
there
the
maker
name
on
the
barrel
i
should
take
a
note
of
it
sir
if
i
was
you
that
name
and
that
note
were
all
that
langholm
had
to
show
when
he
dined
with
the
criminologist
at
his
service
club
the
same
evening
the
amateur
detective
looked
a
beaten
man
already
but
he
talked
through
his
teeth
of
inspecting
the
revolvers
in
every
pawnbroker
shop
in
london
it
will
take
you
a
year
said
the
old
soldier
cheerfully
it
seems
the
only
chance
replied
the
despondent
novelist
it
is
a
case
of
doing
that
or
nothing
then
take
the
advice
of
an
older
fogey
than
yourself
and
do
nothing
you
are
quite
right
to
believe
in
the
lady
innocence
there
is
no
excuse
for
entertaining
any
other
belief
still
less
for
expressing
it
but
when
you
come
to
putting
salt
on
the
real
culprit
that
another
matter
my
dear
fellow
it
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
you
or
i
could
hope
to
do
on
our
own
even
were
the
case
far
simpler
than
it
is
it
was
very
sporting
of
you
to
offer
for
a
moment
to
try
your
hand
but
if
i
were
you
i
should
confess
without
delay
that
the
task
is
far
beyond
you
for
that
the
honest
truth
langholm
walked
back
to
his
hotel
revolving
this
advice
its
soundness
was
undeniable
while
the
source
from
which
it
came
gave
it
exceptional
weight
and
value
it
was
an
expert
opinion
which
no
man
in
his
senses
could
afford
to
ignore
and
langholm
felt
that
steel
also
ought
at
least
to
hear
it
before
building
on
his
efforts
the
letter
would
prepare
her
for
his
ultimate
failure
as
it
was
only
fair
that
she
should
be
prepared
and
yet
would
leave
him
free
to
strain
every
nerve
in
any
fresh
direction
in
which
a
chance
ray
lit
the
path
but
it
would
be
a
difficult
letter
to
write
and
langholm
was
still
battling
with
the
first
sentence
when
he
reached
the
cadogan
a
gentleman
to
see
me
he
cried
in
surprise
what
gentleman
would
leave
his
name
sir
said
he
call
again
a
foreign
gentleman
he
seemed
to
me
a
man
very
sir
you
seem
to
know
him
better
than
he
knows
you
added
the
with
whom
langholm
had
made
friends
he
was
certain
whether
it
was
the
langholm
he
wanted
who
was
staying
here
and
he
asked
to
look
at
the
register
did
you
let
him
see
it
cried
langholm
quickly
i
did
sir
then
let
me
have
another
look
at
it
please
it
was
as
langholm
feared
thoughtlessly
but
naturally
enough
when
requested
to
put
his
own
name
in
the
book
he
had
also
filled
in
that
full
address
which
he
took
such
pains
to
conceal
in
places
where
he
was
better
known
and
that
miserable
young
italian
that
fellow
severino
had
discovered
not
only
where
he
was
staying
in
town
but
where
he
lived
in
the
country
and
his
next
discovery
would
be
normanthorpe
house
and
its
new
mistress
langholm
felt
enraged
after
his
own
promise
to
write
to
rachel
a
promise
already
fulfilled
the
unhappy
youth
might
have
had
the
decency
to
refrain
from
underhand
tricks
like
this
langholm
felt
inclined
to
take
a
cab
at
once
to
severino
lodgings
there
to
relieve
his
mind
by
a
very
plain
expression
of
his
opinion
but
it
was
late
and
perhaps
allowances
should
be
made
for
a
sick
man
with
a
passion
as
hopeless
as
his
bodily
state
in
any
case
he
would
sleep
upon
it
first
but
there
was
no
sleep
for
charles
langholm
that
night
nor
did
the
thought
of
severino
enter
his
head
again
it
was
suddenly
swept
aside
and
as
suddenly
replaced
by
that
of
the
man
who
was
to
fill
the
novelist
mind
for
many
a
day
idly
glancing
up
and
down
the
autographed
pages
of
the
hotel
register
as
his
fingers
turned
leaf
after
leaf
backward
langholm
eye
had
suddenly
caught
a
name
of
late
as
familiar
to
him
as
his
own
it
was
the
name
of
john
buchanan
steel
and
the
date
was
the
date
of
the
minchin
murder
chapter
xxiii
dawn
the
was
only
too
ready
for
further
chat
it
was
the
dull
season
and
this
visitor
was
one
of
a
variety
always
popular
in
the
quieter
hotels
he
was
never
above
a
pleasant
word
with
the
servants
yet
the
porter
stared
at
langholm
as
he
approached
his
face
was
flushed
and
his
eyes
so
bright
that
there
would
have
been
but
one
diagnosis
by
the
average
observer
but
the
porter
knew
that
langholm
had
come
in
sober
and
that
for
the
last
twenty
minutes
he
had
sat
absorbed
in
the
hotel
register
i
see
said
langholm
and
even
his
voice
was
altered
which
made
the
other
stare
the
harder
i
see
that
a
friend
of
mine
stayed
here
just
upon
a
year
ago
i
wonder
if
you
remember
him
if
it
was
the
sir
i
dare
say
i
shall
it
was
in
september
and
his
name
was
steel
how
long
did
he
stay
only
one
night
i
gather
an
elderly
gentleman
with
very
white
hair
the
porter
face
lighted
up
i
remember
him
sir
i
should
think
i
did
a
very
rich
gentleman
i
should
say
yes
he
only
stayed
the
one
night
but
he
gave
me
a
sovereign
when
he
went
away
next
day
he
is
very
rich
said
langholm
repressing
by
main
force
a
desire
to
ask
a
string
of
questions
he
fancied
that
the
porter
was
not
one
who
needed
questioning
and
his
patience
had
its
immediate
reward
i
remember
when
he
arrived
the
man
went
on
it
was
late
at
night
and
he
had
ordered
his
room
he
came
in
first
to
see
whether
we
could
give
him
one
i
paid
the
cab
myself
and
brought
in
his
bag
he
had
just
arrived
from
the
country
i
presume
the
porter
nodded
at
king
cross
by
the
i
believe
but
it
must
have
been
a
good
bit
late
for
i
was
just
coming
off
duty
and
the
was
just
coming
on
then
you
did
see
any
more
of
steel
that
night
i
saw
him
go
out
again
said
the
porter
dryly
after
he
had
something
to
eat
for
we
are
in
the
and
i
stopped
up
myself
to
see
he
got
it
i
did
see
him
come
in
the
second
time
langholm
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
to
cover
his
excitement
he
burst
out
laughing
the
old
dog
he
cried
do
you
know
if
he
ever
came
in
at
all
between
two
and
three
i
believe
said
the
porter
in
the
same
tone
langholm
laughed
again
but
asked
no
more
questions
and
in
a
little
he
was
pacing
his
bedroom
floor
with
fevered
face
and
tremulous
stride
as
he
was
to
continue
pacing
it
for
the
greater
part
of
that
august
night
yet
it
was
not
a
night
spent
in
thought
but
rather
in
intercepting
and
in
casting
out
the
kind
of
thoughts
that
chased
each
other
through
the
novelist
brain
his
imagination
had
him
by
the
forelock
once
more
but
this
time
he
was
resisting
with
all
his
might
it
meant
resistance
to
the
strongest
attribute
that
he
possessed
the
man
mind
was
now
a
and
now
a
stage
he
thought
in
pictures
and
he
saw
in
scenes
it
was
no
fault
of
langholm
any
more
than
it
was
a
merit
imagination
was
the
predominant
force
of
his
intellect
as
in
others
is
the
power
of
reasoning
or
the
gift
of
languages
or
the
mastery
of
figures
langholm
could
no
more
help
it
than
he
could
change
the
color
of
his
eyes
but
he
did
his
best
he
had
mistaken
invention
for
discovery
once
already
he
was
grimly
determined
not
to
let
it
happen
twice
to
suspect
steel
because
he
chanced
to
have
been
in
the
neighborhood
of
chelsea
on
the
night
of
the
murder
and
absent
from
his
hotel
about
the
hour
of
its
committal
was
not
less
absurd
than
his
first
suspicion
of
the
man
who
could
be
proved
to
have
been
lying
between
life
and
death
at
the
time
there
had
been
something
to
connect
the
dead
man
with
severino
there
was
nothing
within
langholm
knowledge
to
connect
him
with
steel
yet
steel
was
the
most
mysterious
person
that
he
had
ever
met
with
outside
the
pages
of
his
own
novels
no
one
knew
where
he
had
made
his
money
he
might
well
have
made
it
in
australia
they
might
have
known
each
other
out
there
langholm
suddenly
remembered
the
australian
swagman
whom
he
had
seen
knocking
down
his
check
at
a
wayside
inn
within
a
few
miles
of
normanthorpe
and
steel
gratuitously
explicit
statement
that
neither
he
nor
his
wife
had
ever
been
in
australia
in
their
lives
there
was
one
lie
at
least
then
why
not
two
yet
the
proven
lie
might
have
been
told
by
steel
simply
to
anticipate
and
allay
any
possible
suspicion
of
his
wife
identity
that
was
at
least
conceivable
and
this
time
langholm
sought
the
conceivable
explanation
more
sedulously
than
the
suspicious
circumstance
he
had
been
far
too
precipitate
in
all
that
he
had
done
hitherto
from
the
monday
morning
up
to
this
wednesday
night
his
departure
on
the
monday
had
been
in
itself
premature
he
had
come
away
without
seeing
the
steels
again
whereas
he
should
have
had
an
exhaustive
interview
with
one
or
both
of
them
before
embarking
upon
his
task
but
and
attitude
was
more
than
langholm
could
trust
his
temper
to
endure
and
he
had
despaired
of
seeing
steel
alone
there
were
innumerable
points
upon
which
she
could
have
supplied
him
with
valuable
information
he
had
hoped
to
obtain
what
he
wanted
from
the
fuller
reports
of
the
trial
but
that
investigation
had
been
conducted
upon
the
supposition
that
his
wife
and
no
other
had
caused
the
death
of
alexander
minchin
no
business
friend
of
the
deceased
had
been
included
among
the
witnesses
and
the
very
least
had
been
made
of
his
financial
difficulties
which
had
formed
no
part
of
the
case
for
the
crown
langholm
however
his
wits
immensely
quickened
by
the
tonic
of
his
new
discovery
began
to
see
possibilities
in
this
aspect
of
the
matter
and
as
soon
as
the
telegraph
offices
were
open
he
despatched
a
rather
long
message
to
steel
reply
paid
it
was
simply
to
request
the
business
address
of
her
late
husband
with
the
name
and
address
of
any
partner
or
other
business
man
who
had
seen
much
of
him
in
the
city
if
the
telegram
were
not
intercepted
langholm
calculated
that
he
should
have
his
reply
in
a
couple
of
hours
and
one
came
early
in
the
forenoon
shared
office
adam
court
old
broad
street
with
a
crofts
his
friend
but
not
mine
rachel
steel
langholm
looked
first
at
the
end
and
was
thankful
to
see
that
the
reply
was
from
rachel
herself
but
the
penultimate
clause
introduced
a
complication
it
must
have
some
meaning
it
would
scarcely
be
a
wholly
irrelevant
expression
of
dislike
langholm
at
all
events
read
a
warning
in
the
words
a
warning
to
himself
not
to
call
on
crofts
as
a
friend
of
the
dead
man
wife
and
this
increased
the
complication
ultimately
suggesting
a
bolder
step
than
the
man
of
letters
quite
relished
yet
one
which
he
took
without
hesitation
in
rachel
cause
he
had
in
his
pocket
the
card
of
the
detective
officer
who
had
shown
him
over
the
black
museum
luckily
it
was
still
quite
clean
and
langholm
only
wished
he
looked
the
part
a
little
more
as
he
finally
sallied
forth
crofts
was
in
his
small
clerk
said
and
the
sham
detective
followed
the
real
one
card
into
the
inner
chamber
of
the
poky
offices
upon
the
third
floor
crofts
sat
aghast
in
his
office
chair
the
puzzled
picture
of
a
man
who
feels
his
hour
has
come
but
who
wonders
which
of
his
many
delinquencies
has
come
to
light
he
was
large
and
florid
with
a
bald
head
and
a
dyed
mustache
but
his
coloring
was
an
unwholesome
purple
as
the
false
pretender
was
ushered
in
i
am
sorry
to
intrude
upon
you
crofts
began
langholm
but
i
have
come
to
make
a
few
inquiries
about
the
late
alexander
minchin
who
i
believe
once
quite
right
quite
right
cried
crofts
as
the
purple
turned
a
normal
red
in
his
sanguine
countenance
alexander
minchin
poor
fellow
to
be
sure
take
a
seat
inspector
take
a
seat
happy
to
afford
you
any
information
in
my
power
if
crofts
looked
relieved
however
as
many
a
decent
citizen
might
under
similar
visitation
it
was
a
very
real
relief
to
langholm
not
to
have
been
found
out
at
a
glance
he
took
the
proffered
seat
with
the
greater
readiness
on
noting
how
near
it
was
to
the
door
the
death
of
minchin
is
as
you
know
still
a
mystery
i
did
know
it
interrupted
crofts
who
had
quite
recovered
his
spirits
i
thought
the
only
mystery
was
how
twelve
sane
men
could
have
acquitted
his
wife
that
said
langholm
was
the
opinion
of
many
at
the
time
but
it
is
one
which
we
are
obliged
to
disregard
whether
we
agree
with
it
or
not
the
case
still
engages
our
attention
and
must
do
so
until
we
have
explored
every
possible
channel
of
investigation
what
i
want
from
you
crofts
is
any
information
that
you
can
give
me
concerning
minchin
financial
position
at
the
time
of
his
death
it
was
bad
said
crofts
promptly
about
as
bad
as
it
could
be
he
had
one
lucky
flutter
and
it
would
have
been
the
ruin
of
him
if
he
had
lived
he
backed
his
luck
for
more
than
it
was
worth
and
his
luck
deserted
him
on
the
spot
yes
poor
old
devil
sighed
the
sympathetic
crofts
he
thought
he
was
going
to
make
his
pile
out
of
hand
but
in
another
week
he
would
have
been
a
bankrupt
had
you
known
him
long
mr
crofts
not
six
months
it
was
down
at
brighton
we
met
quite
by
chance
and
got
on
talking
about
westralians
it
was
i
put
him
on
to
his
one
good
spec
his
wife
was
with
him
at
the
time
could
stand
the
woman
she
was
much
too
good
for
me
and
my
missus
to
say
nothing
of
her
own
husband
i
remember
one
night
on
the
pier
i
wo
trouble
you
about
brighton
crofts
langholm
interrupted
as
politely
as
he
could
minchin
was
not
afterwards
a
partner
of
yours
was
he
never
though
i
wo
say
he
might
have
been
if
things
had
panned
out
differently
and
he
had
gone
back
to
westralia
with
some
capital
meanwhile
he
had
the
run
of
my
office
and
that
was
all
and
not
even
the
benefit
of
your
advice
he
would
take
it
once
he
was
bitten
with
the
game
thus
far
langholm
had
simply
satisfied
his
own
curiosity
upon
one
or
two
points
concerning
a
dead
man
who
had
been
little
more
than
a
name
to
him
hitherto
his
one
discovery
of
the
least
potential
value
was
that
minchin
had
evidently
died
in
difficulties
he
now
consulted
some
notes
jotted
down
on
an
envelope
upon
his
way
to
the
city
minchin
as
you
are
aware
resumed
langholm
was
like
his
wife
an
australian
by
birth
had
he
many
australian
friends
here
in
london
none
at
all
replied
crofts
that
i
am
aware
of
nor
anywhere
else
in
the
country
think
you
not
that
i
remember
not
in
the
north
of
england
for
example
thus
led
crofts
frowned
at
his
desk
until
an
enlightened
look
broke
over
his
florid
face
by
jove
yes
said
he
now
you
speak
of
it
there
somebody
up
north
a
rich
man
too
but
he
only
heard
of
him
by
chance
a
day
or
so
before
his
death
a
rich
man
you
say
and
an
australian
i
do
know
about
that
but
it
was
out
there
they
had
known
each
other
and
minchin
had
no
idea
he
was
in
england
till
he
saw
it
in
the
paper
a
day
or
two
before
his
death
do
you
remember
the
name
no
i
do
for
he
never
told
it
to
me
fact
is
we
were
not
on
the
best
of
terms
just
at
the
last
explained
crofts
money
matters
money
matters
they
divide
the
best
of
friends
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
owed
me
more
than
i
could
afford
to
lose
but
the
day
before
the
last
day
of
his
life
he
came
in
and
said
it
was
all
right
he
square
up
before
the
week
was
out
and
if
that
was
good
enough
for
me
i
could
go
to
the
devil
of
course
i
asked
him
where
the
money
was
coming
from
and
he
said
from
a
man
he
not
heard
of
for
years
until
that
morning
but
he
did
say
how
he
heard
of
him
then
only
that
he
must
be
a
millionaire
so
then
i
asked
why
a
man
he
had
seen
for
so
long
should
pay
his
debts
but
minchin
only
laughed
and
swore
that
he
make
him
and
that
was
the
last
i
ever
heard
of
it
he
sat
down
at
that
desk
over
yonder
and
wrote
to
his
millionaire
there
and
then
and
took
it
out
himself
to
post
it
was
the
last
time
i
saw
him
alive
for
he
said
he
was
coming
back
till
he
got
his
answer
and
it
was
the
last
letter
he
ever
wrote
in
the
place
on
that
desk
eh
langholm
glanced
at
the
spare
piece
of
office
furniture
in
the
corner
did
he
keep
any
papers
here
he
added
he
did
but
you
fellows
impounded
them
of
course
we
did
said
langholm
hastily
then
you
have
nothing
of
his
left
only
his
pen
and
a
diary
in
which
he
had
written
a
word
i
slipped
them
into
a
drawer
with
his
papers
and
there
they
are
still
langholm
felt
disappointed
he
had
learnt
so
much
it
was
tantalizing
not
to
learn
a
little
more
if
he
could
only
make
sure
of
that
millionaire
friend
of
minchin
in
his
own
mind
he
was
all
but
sure
but
his
own
mind
was
too
elastic
by
half
crofts
was
drumming
on
the
in
front
of
him
all
of
a
sudden
langholm
noticed
that
it
had
a
diary
attached
minchin
diary
was
one
like
yours
was
it
he
exclaimed
the
same
thing
said
crofts
then
i
should
like
to
see
it
there
not
a
word
written
in
it
one
of
you
chaps
overhauled
it
at
the
time
never
mind
well
then
it
in
the
top
long
drawer
of
the
desk
he
used
to
use
if
my
clerk
has
not
appropriated
it
to
his
own
use
langholm
held
his
breath
as
he
went
to
the
drawer
in
question
in
another
instant
his
breath
escaped
him
in
a
sigh
of
thankfulness
the
universal
diary
for
the
year
before
was
there
sure
enough
and
it
was
attached
to
a
pink
blotter
precisely
similar
to
that
upon
which
crofts
still
drummed
with
idle
fingers
anything
more
i
can
show
you
inquired
that
worthy
humorously
langholm
was
gazing
intently
not
at
the
diary
but
at
the
pink
suddenly
he
looked
up
you
say
that
was
the
last
letter
he
ever
wrote
in
your
office
the
very
last
then
yes
you
can
show
me
a
if
you
have
one
crofts
had
a
small
one
on
his
by
the
lord
harry
said
he
handing
it
but
you
are
a
leery
lot
chapter
xxiv
one
who
was
not
bidden
langholm
went
north
next
morning
by
the
ten
express
from
cross
he
had
been
but
four
nights
in
town
and
not
four
days
yet
to
langholm
they
might
have
been
weeks
for
he
had
never
felt
so
much
and
slept
so
little
in
all
his
life
he
had
also
done
a
good
deal
but
it
is
the
moments
of
keen
sensation
that
make
up
the
really
crowded
hours
and
langholm
was
to
run
the
gamut
of
his
emotions
before
this
memorable
week
was
out
in
psychological
experience
it
was
to
be
for
him
a
little
lifetime
in
itself
indeed
the
week
seemed
that
already
while
it
was
still
young
and
comparatively
poor
in
incident
and
surprise
he
had
bought
magazines
and
the
literary
papers
for
his
journey
but
he
could
concentrate
his
mind
on
nothing
and
only
the
exigencies
of
railway
travelling
kept
him
off
his
legs
luckily
for
langholm
however
sleep
came
to
him
when
least
expected
in
his
cool
corner
of
the
corridor
train
and
he
only
awoke
in
time
for
luncheon
before
the
change
at
york
his
tired
brain
was
vastly
refreshed
but
so
far
he
could
not
concentrate
it
even
on
the
events
of
these
eventful
days
he
was
still
in
the
thick
of
them
a
sense
of
proportion
was
as
yet
impossible
and
a
consecutive
review
the
most
difficult
of
intellectual
feats
langholm
was
too
excited
and
the
situation
too
identical
with
suspense
for
a
clear
sight
of
all
its
bearings
and
potentialities
and
then
there
was
the
stern
the
determined
bridling
of
the
imagination
in
which
he
had
not
yet
relaxed
once
in
the
night
however
in
the
hopeless
hours
between
darkness
and
broad
day
he
had
seen
clearly
for
a
while
and
there
and
then
pinned
his
vision
down
to
paper
it
concerned
only
one
aspect
of
the
case
but
this
was
how
langholm
found
that
he
had
stated
it
on
taking
out
his
during
the
final
stages
of
his
journey
provisional
case
against
was
in
sloane
street
on
the
night
of
the
murder
at
an
hotel
about
a
mile
from
the
house
in
which
the
murder
was
committed
this
can
be
proved

after

towards

thus

time
at

committed

to

evidence

at

proved

letter
on
receipt
of
which
came
up
to
town
arriving
near
scene
of
murder
as
above
stated
about
time
of
commission
all
this
morally
certain
and
probably
capable
of
legal
proof
so
then
i
asked
why
a
man
he
had
seen
for
so
long
should
pay
his
debts
but
only
laughed
and
swore
and
said
he
make
him
could
be
subpoenaed
to
confirm
if
not
to
amplify
this
statement
to
me
with
others
to
effect
that
it
was
for
money
admitted
having
written
to
a
millionaire
attended
trial
throughout
thereafter
making
her
acquaintance
and
offering
marriage
without
any
previous
private
knowledge
whatsoever
of
her
character
or
antecedents
possible
motives
is
a
human
mystery
his
past
life
a
greater
one
he
elaborately
pretends
that
no
part
of
that
past
was
spent
in
australia
said
he
knew
him
there
also
that
he
make
him
pay
up
blackmail
not
inconsistent
with
character
men
have
died
as
they
deserved
before
for
threatening
blackmail
motive
for
atonement
of
the
guilty
to
the
innocent
as
langholm
read
and
these
precise
pronouncements
with
something
of
the
detachment
and
the
mild
surprise
with
which
he
occasionally
dipped
into
his
own
earlier
volumes
he
congratulated
himself
upon
the
evidently
lucid
interval
which
had
produced
so
much
order
from
the
chaos
that
had
been
his
mind
chaotic
as
its
condition
still
was
that
orderly
array
of
impression
discovery
and
surmise
bore
the
test
of
conscientious
reconsideration
and
there
was
nothing
that
langholm
felt
moved
to
strike
out
in
the
train
but
on
the
other
hand
he
saw
the
weakness
of
his
case
as
it
stood
at
present
and
was
helped
to
see
it
by
the
detective
officer
remark
to
him
at
scotland
yard
you
find
one
old
australian
who
carries
a
revolver
like
this
and
prove
that
he
was
in
chelsea
on
the
night
of
the
murder
with
a
motive
for
committing
it
and
we
shall
be
glad
of
his
name
and
address
langholm
had
found
the
old
australian
who
could
be
proved
to
have
been
in
chelsea
or
thereabouts
on
the
night
in
question
but
the
pistol
he
could
not
hope
to
find
and
the
motive
was
mere
surmise
and
yet
to
the
walls
of
the
mind
that
he
was
trying
so
hard
to
cleanse
from
prejudice
and
prepossession
to
school
indeed
to
an
inhuman
fairness
there
clung
small
circumstances
and
smaller
details
which
could
influence
no
one
else
which
would
not
constitute
evidence
before
any
tribunal
but
which
weighed
more
with
langholm
himself
than
all
the
points
arrayed
in
his
with
so
much
primness
and
precision
there
was
rachel
vain
appeal
to
her
husband
find
out
who
guilty
if
you
want
people
to
believe
that
i
am
not
why
should
so
natural
a
petition
have
been
made
in
vain
to
a
husband
who
after
all
had
shown
some
solicitude
for
his
wife
honor
and
who
had
the
means
to
employ
the
best
detective
talent
in
the
world
langholm
could
only
conceive
one
reason
there
was
nothing
for
the
husband
to
find
out
but
everything
for
him
to
hide
langholm
remembered
the
way
in
which
steel
had
looked
at
his
wife
before
replying
and
the
man
embarrassment
grew
automatically
in
his
mind
his
lips
had
indeed
shut
very
tight
but
unconscious
exaggeration
made
them
tremble
first
and
then
the
fellow
manner
to
himself
his
defiant
taunts
his
final
challenge
langholm
was
not
sorry
to
remember
the
last
it
relieved
him
from
the
moral
incubus
of
the
clandestine
and
the
underhand
it
bid
him
go
on
and
do
his
worst
it
set
his
eyes
upon
the
issue
as
between
himself
and
steel
and
it
shut
them
to
the
final
possibilities
as
touching
the
woman
in
the
case
so
langholm
came
back
from
sultry
london
to
a
world
of
smoke
and
rain
with
furnaces
flaring
through
the
blurred
windows
and
the
soot
laid
with
the
dust
in
one
of
the
grimiest
towns
in
the
island
but
he
soon
shook
both
from
his
feet
and
doubled
back
upon
the
local
line
to
a
rural
station
within
a
mile
and
a
half
of
his
cottage
this
distance
he
walked
by
muddy
ways
through
the
peculiarly
humid
atmosphere
created
by
a
sky
that
has
rained
itself
out
and
an
earth
that
can
hold
no
more
and
came
finally
to
his
dripping
garden
by
the
wicket
at
the
back
of
the
cottage
there
he
stood
to
inhale
the
fine
earthy
fragrance
which
atoned
somewhat
for
a
rather
desolate
scene
the
roses
were
all
washed
away
william
allen
richardson
clung
here
and
there
in
the
shelter
of
the
southern
eaves
but
he
was
far
past
his
prime
and
had
better
have
perished
with
the
exposed
beauties
on
the
tiny
trees
the
soaking
foliage
had
a
bluish
tinge
the
glimpse
of
wooded
upland
across
the
valley
through
the
gap
in
the
hedge
of
penzance
briers
lay
colorless
and
indistinct
as
a
faded
print
from
an
imperfect
negative
a
footstep
crunched
the
wet
gravel
at
langholm
back
thank
god
you
got
back
sir
cried
a
yorkshire
voice
in
devout
accents
and
langholm
turning
met
the
troubled
face
and
tired
eyes
of
the
woman
next
door
who
kept
house
for
him
while
living
in
her
own
my
dear
brunton
he
exclaimed
what
on
earth
has
happened
you
did
expect
me
earlier
did
you
i
wired
you
my
train
first
thing
this
morning
oh
no
it
is
that
sir
it
it
the
poor
young
gentleman
and
her
apron
went
to
her
eyes
what
young
gentleman
mrs
brunton
him
you
saw
i
london
an
sent
all
this
way
for
change
of
air
he
was
fit
to
travel
half
the
distance
i
been
nursing
of
him
all
night
and
all
day
too
a
young
gentleman
and
sent
by
me
langholm
face
was
blank
until
a
harsh
light
broke
over
it
what
his
name
mrs
brunton
i
ca
tell
you
sir
he
said
he
was
a
friend
of
yours
and
that
was
all
before
he
took
ill
he
been
too
bad
to
answer
questions
all
day
and
then
we
knew
you
soon
be
here
to
tell
us
a
foreigner
i
suppose
i
should
say
he
was
sir
and
did
he
really
tell
you
i
had
sent
him
well
i
ca
say
he
did
not
in
so
many
words
but
that
was
what
i
thought
he
meant
it
was
like
this
sir
continued
brunton
as
they
stood
face
to
face
on
the
wet
gravel
just
about
this
time
yesterday
i
was
busy
ironing
when
my
nephew
the
lad
you
used
to
send
with
letters
who
here
again
for
his
summer
holidays
comes
to
me
says
wanted
so
i
went
and
there
was
a
young
gentleman
looking
fit
to
drop
he
a
bag
with
him
and
he
walked
all
the
way
from
upthorpe
station
same
as
i
suppose
you
have
now
but
yesterday
was
the
hottest
day
we
had
and
i
never
did
see
living
face
so
like
the
dead
he
had
hardly
life
enough
to
ask
if
this
was
where
you
lived
and
when
i
said
it
was
but
you
were
away
he
nodded
and
said
he
just
seen
you
in
london
and
he
was
sure
he
might
come
in
and
rest
a
bit
well
sir
i
not
only
let
him
do
that
but
you
never
will
lock
up
anything
so
i
gave
him
a
good
sup
o
your
whiskey
too
quite
right
said
langholm
and
then
it
seemed
to
pull
him
together
a
bit
and
he
began
to
talk
he
wanted
to
know
about
all
the
grand
folks
round
about
where
they
lived
and
how
long
they
lived
there
at
last
he
made
me
tell
him
the
way
to
normanthorpe
house
after
asking
any
amount
of
questions
about
and
steel
it
was
hard
work
not
to
tell
him
what
had
just
come
out
but
i
remembered
what
you
said
before
you
went
away
sir
and
i
left
that
to
others
good
said
langholm
but
did
he
go
to
normanthorpe
he
started
though
i
begged
him
to
sit
still
while
we
tried
to
get
him
a
trap
from
the
village
and
his
nearly
cost
him
his
life
if
it
does
yet
he
was
hardly
out
of
sight
when
we
see
him
come
staggering
back
with
his
handkerchief
up
to
his
mouth
and
the
blood
dripping
through
his
fingers
into
the
road
a
hemorrhage
yes
sir
yon
was
the
very
word
the
doctor
used
and
he
says
if
he
has
another
it
be
all
up
so
you
may
think
what
a
time
i
had
if
a
friend
of
yours
sir
i
sure
i
do
mind
in
any
case
poor
gentleman
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
interrupted
langholm
and
we
must
do
all
we
can
for
him
i
will
help
you
brunton
you
shall
have
your
sleep
did
you
put
him
into
my
room
no
sir
your
bed
was
ready
so
we
popped
him
straight
into
our
own
and
now
he
has
everything
nice
and
clean
and
comfortable
as
i
could
make
it
if
only
we
can
pull
him
through
poor
young
gentleman
between
us
god
bless
you
for
a
good
woman
said
langholm
from
his
heart
it
will
be
his
will
and
not
your
fault
if
we
fail
yes
i
should
like
to
see
the
poor
fellow
if
i
may
he
is
expecting
you
sir
he
told
sedley
he
must
see
you
the
moment
you
arrived
and
the
doctor
said
he
might
no
he
wo
know
you
here
yet
and
he
ca
have
heard
a
word
for
our
room
is
at
then
i
go
up
alone
brunton
if
you
wo
mind
severino
was
lying
in
a
high
square
bed
his
black
locks
tossed
upon
a
spotless
pillow
no
whiter
than
his
face
a
transparent
hand
came
from
under
the
bedclothes
to
meet
langholm
outstretched
one
but
it
fell
back
upon
the
sick
man
breast
instead
do
you
forgive
me
he
whispered
in
a
voice
both
hoarse
and
hollow
what
for
smiled
langholm
you
had
a
right
to
come
where
you
liked
it
is
a
free
country
severino
but
i
went
to
your
hotel
behind
your
back
that
was
quite
fair
my
good
fellow
come
i
mean
to
shake
hands
whether
you
like
it
or
not
and
the
sound
man
took
the
sick
one
hand
with
womanly
tenderness
and
so
sat
on
the
bed
looking
far
into
the
great
dark
sinks
of
fever
that
were
human
eyes
but
the
fever
was
of
the
brain
for
the
poor
hand
was
cool
you
do
not
ask
me
why
i
did
it
came
from
the
tremulous
lips
at
last
perhaps
i
know
i
will
tell
you
if
you
are
right
it
was
to
see
her
again
your
kindest
friend
and
mine
said
langholm
gently
yes
it
was
to
see
her
again
before
i
die
and
the
black
eyes
blazed
again
you
are
not
going
to
die
said
langholm
with
the
usual
reassuring
scorn
i
am
quite
soon
on
your
hands
i
only
fear
and
i
have
not
seen
her
yet
you
shall
see
her
said
langholm
tenderly
gravely
he
was
rewarded
with
a
slight
pressure
of
the
emaciated
hand
but
for
the
first
time
he
suspected
that
all
the
scrutiny
was
not
upon
one
side
that
the
sick
youth
was
trying
to
read
him
in
his
turn
i
love
her
at
last
cried
severino
in
rapt
whispers
do
you
hear
me
i
love
her
i
love
her
what
does
it
matter
now
it
would
matter
to
her
if
you
told
her
rejoined
langholm
it
would
make
her
very
unhappy
then
i
need
not
tell
her
you
must
not
indeed
very
well
i
will
not
it
is
a
promise
and
i
keep
my
promises
it
is
only
when
i
make
none
that
all
right
said
langholm
smiling
then
you
will
bring
her
to
me
i
shall
have
to
see
her
first
and
the
doctor
but
you
will
do
your
best
that
is
why
i
am
here
remember
i
shall
tell
the
doctor
so
myself
i
will
do
my
best
said
langholm
as
he
rose
a
last
whisper
followed
him
to
the
door
because
i
worship
her
were
the
words
chapter
xxv
a
point
to
langholm
i
am
glad
you
have
come
back
said
sedley
with
relief
of
course
eventually
he
will
require
trained
nursing
either
here
or
somewhere
else
there
is
only
one
end
to
such
a
case
but
it
need
come
yet
unless
he
has
another
hemorrhage
i
understand
you
offered
him
your
cottage
while
you
were
away
but
there
was
some
muddle
and
he
came
before
they
were
ready
for
him
it
was
like
your
kindness
my
dear
fellow
only
never
you
send
another
consumptive
to
the
northeast
coast
or
anywhere
near
it
as
to
his
seeing
any
ladies
who
like
to
look
him
up
by
all
means
only
one
at
a
time
and
they
must
excite
him
your
return
for
example
has
been
quite
enough
excitement
for
and
i
should
keep
him
quiet
for
the
next
hours
the
doctor
had
called
within
an
hour
of
the
return
of
langholm
who
repeated
these
stipulations
upstairs
with
his
own
undertaking
in
regard
to
rachel
he
would
write
that
night
and
beg
her
to
call
the
following
day
no
he
preferred
writing
to
going
to
see
her
and
it
took
up
far
less
time
but
he
would
write
at
once
and
as
he
went
downstairs
to
do
so
then
and
there
langholm
asked
himself
whether
an
honorable
man
could
meet
the
steels
again
without
reading
to
their
faces
the
notes
that
he
had
made
in
london
and
conned
in
the
train
this
letter
written
there
was
a
small
pile
of
them
awaiting
attention
on
top
of
the
old
bureau
and
langholm
sat
glancing
at
proofs
and
crumpling
up
until
he
needed
a
lamp
the
letter
that
he
kept
to
the
last
looked
like
one
of
the
rare
applications
for
his
autograph
which
he
was
not
too
successful
to
welcome
as
straws
showing
the
wind
of
popular
approval
in
opening
the
envelope
however
he
noticed
that
it
bore
the
northborough
postmark
also
that
the
handwriting
was
that
of
an
illiterate
person
and
his
very
surname
misspelt
the
contents
were
as
follows
northborough
august
langham
sir
i
here
as
you
are
on
the
tracks
of
them
that
murdered
alexander
minchin
if
you
want
to
know
of
them
that
had
a
reason
for
doing
it
i
can
give
you
the
straight
tip
i
have
been
out
to
your
place
but
you
are
only
due
home
night
therefore
i
will
be
your
way
again
night
but
will
only
come
to
the
as
your
old
girl
look
suspichious
last
night
and
this
is
on
the
strickt
till
night
then
at
the
near
your
place
from
nine
to
ten
night
when
you
will
here
of
something
to
your
advantage
believe
your
faithly
john
william
abel
langholm
could
not
guess
who
this
man
abel
might
be
but
idly
imagined
him
one
of
the
innumerable
drinking
drones
who
stood
about
the
street
corners
of
northborough
from
morning
till
night
throughout
the
year
this
one
had
more
information
than
the
common
run
with
perhaps
more
cunning
and
ingenuity
to
boot
langholm
deemed
it
discreet
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
his
dear
old
girl
of
disrespectful
reference
who
served
him
an
excellent
supper
at
eight
and
little
better
than
an
hour
later
having
seen
the
invalid
once
more
and
left
him
calm
and
comfortable
for
the
night
the
novelist
sallied
forth
to
meet
his
unknown
correspondent
it
was
a
dark
night
for
the
rain
was
by
no
means
over
though
not
actually
falling
at
the
moment
and
the
which
lay
low
with
trees
in
all
four
angles
was
a
dark
spot
at
full
moon
as
he
approached
with
caution
rapping
the
road
with
his
stick
in
order
to
steer
clear
of
the
ditch
langholm
wished
he
had
come
on
his
bicycle
for
the
sake
of
the
light
he
might
have
had
from
its
lamp
but
a
light
there
was
ready
waiting
for
him
though
a
very
small
and
feeble
one
for
his
illiterate
correspondent
was
on
the
ground
before
him
with
a
in
full
blast
name
of
langholm
said
a
rather
rollicking
voice
with
a
rank
puff
and
a
shower
of
sparks
as
the
cautious
steps
followed
the
rapping
stick
that
it
said
langholm
if
yours
is
abel
i
have
got
your
letter
you
have
have
you
cried
the
other
with
the
same
jovial
familiarity
and
what
do
you
think
of
it
the
glowing
pipe
lit
a
wild
brown
beard
and
mustache
thickly
streaked
with
gray
a
bronzed
nose
and
nothing
more
indeed
it
was
only
at
each
inhalation
that
so
much
stood
out
upon
the
surrounding
screen
of
impenetrable
blackness
langholm
kept
his
distance
stick
in
hand
his
gaunt
figure
as
invisible
as
the
overhanging
trees
but
his
voice
might
have
belonged
to
the
most
formidable
of
men
as
yet
said
he
sternly
i
think
very
little
of
either
you
or
your
letter
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
mean
by
writing
to
me
like
that
steady
mister
you
do
know
my
name
remonstrated
the
man
in
rather
more
respectful
tones
it
abel
john
william
and
as
much
at
your
service
as
you
like
if
you
take
him
proper
but
he
comes
from
a
country
where
jack
is
the
dirt
under
his
master
feet
and
you
no
master
o
mine
i
do
want
to
be
my
good
fellow
rejoined
langholm
modifying
his
own
manner
in
turn
then
you
not
a
northborough
man
not
me
i
seem
to
have
heard
your
voice
before
said
langholm
to
whom
the
wild
hair
on
the
invisible
face
was
also
not
altogether
unfamiliar
where
do
you
come
from
a
little
place
called
australia
the
devil
you
do
and
langholm
stood
very
still
in
the
dark
for
now
he
knew
who
this
man
was
and
what
manner
of
evidence
he
might
furnish
and
against
whom
the
missing
links
in
his
own
secret
chain
what
if
these
were
about
to
be
given
to
him
by
a
miracle
who
had
discovered
so
much
already
by
sheer
chance
it
seemed
impossible
yet
his
instinct
convinced
langholm
of
the
nature
of
that
which
was
to
come
without
another
word
he
stood
until
he
could
trust
himself
to
speak
carelessly
while
the
colonist
made
traditional
comparisons
between
the
old
country
as
he
found
it
and
the
one
which
he
wished
he
had
never
left
i
know
you
said
langholm
when
he
paused
you
the
man
i
saw
down
your
check
as
you
called
it
at
an
inn
near
here
called
the
packhorse
i
am
so
cried
the
fellow
with
sudden
savagery
and
do
you
know
where
i
got
the
check
to
knock
down
i
believe
he
a
friend
of
yours
it
him
i
come
to
talk
to
you
about
and
he
calls
himself
steel
is
it
his
real
name
asked
langholm
quickly
well
for
all
i
know
it
is
if
it
is
it
ought
to
be
added
abel
bitterly
you
knew
him
in
australia
then
knew
him
i
should
think
i
did
know
him
but
who
told
you
he
was
ever
out
there
not
him
i
warrant
i
happen
to
know
it
said
langholm
that
all
but
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
it
was
steel
to
whom
you
referred
in
your
letter
i
do
so
cried
abel
and
clinched
it
with
an
oath
you
said
but
i
did
mean
anybody
else
langholm
lowered
his
voice
neither
foot
nor
hoof
had
passed
or
even
sounded
in
the
distance
there
was
scarcely
a
whisper
of
the
trees
an
ordinary
approach
could
have
been
heard
for
hundreds
of
yards
a
stealthy
one
for
tens
langholm
had
heard
nothing
though
his
ears
were
pricked
and
yet
he
lowered
his
voice
do
you
actually
hint
that
steel
has
or
could
have
been
a
gainer
by
minchin
death
abel
pondered
his
reply
what
i
will
say
he
declared
at
length
is
that
he
might
have
been
a
loser
by
his
life
you
mean
if
minchin
had
gone
on
living
yes
amounts
to
the
same
thing
does
it
you
are
not
thinking
of
of
mrs
steel
queried
langholm
after
pausing
in
his
turn
bless
you
no
she
was
born
or
thought
of
so
far
as
we
was
concerned
when
we
were
all
three
mates
up
the
bush
ah
all
three
steel
minchin
and
me
nodded
abel
as
his
cutty
glowed
and
you
were
mates
well
we
were
and
we
were
that
just
it
said
abel
resentfully
it
would
be
better
for
some
coves
now
if
we
all
been
on
the
same
footin
then
but
that
we
never
were
i
was
overseer
at
the
principal
a
good
enough
billet
in
its
way
and
minchin
was
overseer
in
at
the
homestead
but
steel
was
the
boss
damn
him
trust
steel
to
be
the
boss
but
if
the
station
was
his
queried
langholm
i
suppose
it
was
a
station
he
added
as
a
furious
shower
of
sparks
came
from
the
cutty
was
it
a
station
the
echoed
only
about
the
biggest
and
the
best
in
the
blessed
that
all
only
about
half
the
size
of
your
blessed
little
old
country
cut
out
square
oh
yes
it
was
his
all
right
bought
it
for
a
song
after
the
bad
seasons
fifteen
year
ago
and
sold
it
in
the
end
for
a
quarter
of
a
million
after
making
a
fortune
off
of
his
clips
alone
and
what
did
i
get
out
of
it
demanded
abel
furiously
what
was
my
share
a
beggarly
check
same
as
he
give
me
the
other
day
and
not
a
penny
more
i
do
know
how
much
that
was
remarked
langholm
but
if
you
a
partner
what
claim
had
you
on
the
profits
aha
that
tellings
said
abel
with
a
sudden
change
both
of
tone
and
humor
that
what
i
here
to
tell
you
if
you
really
want
to
know
rum
thing
was
it
one
night
i
turn
up
like
any
other
swaggy
humping
bluey
and
next
week
i
overseer
on
a
good
screw
i
will
say
that
and
my
own
boss
out
at
the
same
way
one
morning
i
turn
up
at
his
grand
homestead
here
and
you
know
what
it
was
a
check
for
three
figures
i
do
mind
telling
you
it
ought
to
have
been
four
but
why
do
you
suppose
he
made
it
even
three
not
for
charity
you
bet
your
boots
i
leave
it
to
you
to
guess
what
for
the
riddle
was
perhaps
more
easily
solvable
by
an
inveterate
novelist
than
by
the
average
member
of
the
community
it
was
of
a
kind
which
langholm
had
been
concocting
for
many
years
i
suppose
there
is
some
secret
said
he
taking
a
fresh
grip
of
his
stick
in
sudden
loathing
of
the
living
type
which
he
had
only
imagined
hitherto
ah
you
hit
it
purred
the
wretch
it
is
evident
enough
and
always
has
been
for
that
matter
said
langholm
coldly
and
so
you
know
what
his
secret
is
i
do
mister
and
did
mr
minchin
he
did
you
would
tell
him
of
course
the
sort
of
scorn
was
too
delicate
for
john
william
abel
yet
even
he
seemed
to
realize
that
an
admission
must
be
accompanied
by
some
form
of
excuse
i
did
tell
him
he
said
for
i
felt
i
owed
it
to
him
he
was
a
good
friend
to
me
was
minchin
and
neither
of
us
was
getting
enough
for
all
we
did
that
was
what
i
felt
to
have
his
own
way
the
boss
ride
roughshod
over
us
both
and
he
himself
only
but
that
tellings
again
you
must
wait
a
bit
mister
minchin
had
to
wait
so
very
long
because
i
thought
we
could
make
him
listen
to
two
of
us
so
one
night
i
told
him
what
i
knew
you
could
ha
knocked
him
down
with
a
feather
nobody
dreamt
of
it
in
new
south
wales
no
there
was
a
hand
on
the
place
who
would
have
thought
it
o
the
boss
well
he
was
fond
of
minchin
treated
him
like
a
son
and
perhaps
he
was
such
a
good
son
as
he
might
have
been
but
when
he
told
the
boss
what
i
told
him
and
made
the
suggestion
that
i
thought
would
come
best
from
a
gent
like
him
that
you
should
both
be
taken
into
partnership
on
the
spot
i
suppose
interrupted
langholm
well
yes
it
came
to
something
like
that
go
on
abel
i
wo
interrupt
again
what
happened
then
well
he
got
to
go
had
minchin
the
boss
told
him
he
could
tell
who
he
liked
but
go
he
have
to
and
go
he
did
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
and
not
another
word
to
anybody
i
believe
it
was
the
boss
who
started
him
in
western
australia
not
such
a
bad
boss
remarked
langholm
dryly
and
the
words
set
him
thinking
a
moment
on
his
own
account
and
what
happened
to
you
he
added
abandoning
reflection
by
an
effort
i
stayed
on
forgiven
if
you
like
to
put
it
that
way
and
you
both
filed
the
secret
for
future
use
do
talk
through
your
neck
mister
said
abel
huffily
what
are
you
drivin
at
you
kept
this
secret
up
your
sleeve
to
play
it
for
all
it
was
worth
in
a
country
where
it
would
be
worth
more
than
it
was
in
the
that
all
i
mean
well
if
i
did
that
my
own
affair
oh
certainly
only
you
came
here
at
your
own
proposal
in
order
i
suppose
to
sell
this
secret
to
me
yes
to
sell
it
then
you
see
it
is
more
or
less
my
affair
as
well
it
may
be
said
abel
doggedly
and
his
face
was
very
evil
as
he
struck
a
match
to
relight
his
pipe
but
before
the
flame
langholm
had
stepped
backward
with
his
stick
that
no
superfluous
light
might
fall
upon
his
thin
wrists
and
sleeves
you
are
sure
he
pursued
that
minchin
was
in
possession
of
this
precious
secret
at
the
time
of
his
death
i
told
it
him
myself
it
is
one
you
would
forget
was
it
one
that
he
could
prove
easily
could
i
anybody
could
well
and
what
your
price
fifty
pounds
nonsense
i
not
a
rich
man
like
mr
steel
i
do
take
less
from
anybody
not
much
less
anyhow
not
twenty
in
hard
cash
not
me
but
look
here
mister
you
show
me
thirty
and
we
see
the
voice
drew
uncomfortably
close
and
there
were
steps
upon
the
at
last
they
were
those
of
one
advancing
with
lumbering
gait
and
of
another
stepping
nimbly
backward
the
latter
laughed
aloud
did
you
really
think
i
would
come
to
meet
the
writer
of
a
letter
like
yours
at
night
in
a
spot
like
this
with
a
single
in
my
pocket
come
to
my
cottage
and
we
settle
there
i
not
coming
in
to
the
gate
then
it
is
three
hundred
yards
from
this
i
lead
the
way
langholm
set
off
at
a
brisk
walk
his
heart
in
his
mouth
but
the
lumbering
steps
did
not
gain
upon
him
a
muttered
grumbling
was
their
only
accompaniment
and
in
minute
they
saw
the
lights
in
another
minute
they
were
at
the
wicket
you
really
prefer
not
to
come
in
there
was
a
sly
restrained
humor
in
langholm
tone
i
do
and
do
be
long
oh
no
i
sha
be
a
minute
there
were
other
lights
in
the
other
cottage
it
was
not
at
all
late
a
warm
parallelogram
appeared
and
disappeared
as
langholm
opened
his
door
and
went
in
was
it
a
sound
of
bolts
and
bars
that
followed
abel
was
still
wondering
when
his
prospective
paymaster
threw
up
the
window
and
reappeared
across
the
sill
it
was
a
check
you
had
from
steel
was
it
yes
yes
but
not
so
loud
and
then
he
sent
you
to
the
devil
to
do
your
worst
that
your
way
of
putting
it
i
do
the
same
without
the
check
and
the
window
shut
with
a
slam
the
hasp
was
fastened
and
the
blind
pulled
down
chapter
xxvi
a
cardinal
point
the
irresistible
discomfiture
of
this
ruffian
did
not
affect
the
value
of
the
evidence
which
he
had
volunteered
langholm
was
glad
to
remember
that
he
had
volunteered
it
the
creature
was
well
served
for
his
spite
and
his
cupidity
and
the
man
of
peace
and
letters
whose
temperament
shrank
from
contention
of
any
kind
could
not
but
congratulate
himself
upon
an
incidental
triumph
for
which
it
was
impossible
to
feel
the
smallest
compunction
moreover
he
had
gained
his
point
it
was
enough
for
him
to
know
that
there
was
a
certain
secret
in
steel
life
upon
which
the
wretch
abel
had
admittedly
traded
even
as
his
superior
minchin
had
apparently
intended
to
do
before
him
only
those
two
seemed
to
have
been
in
this
secret
and
one
of
them
still
lived
to
reveal
it
when
called
upon
with
authority
the
nature
of
the
secret
mattered
nothing
in
the
meanwhile
here
was
the
motive
without
which
the
case
against
john
buchanan
steel
must
have
remained
incomplete
langholm
added
it
to
his
notes
and
trembled
he
had
compunction
enough
about
the
major
triumph
which
now
seemed
in
certain
store
for
him
the
larger
it
loomed
the
less
triumphant
and
the
more
tragic
was
its
promise
and
with
all
human
perversity
an
unforeseen
and
quite
involuntary
sympathy
with
steel
was
the
last
complication
in
langholm
mind
he
had
to
think
of
rachel
in
order
to
harden
his
heart
against
her
husband
and
that
ground
was
the
most
dangerous
of
all
it
was
strange
to
langholm
to
battle
against
by
the
bedside
of
a
weaker
brother
fallen
in
the
same
fight
yet
it
was
there
he
spent
the
night
he
had
scarcely
slept
all
the
week
it
was
a
comfort
to
think
that
this
vigil
was
a
useful
one
severino
slept
fitfully
and
langholm
had
never
a
long
stretch
of
uninterrupted
thought
but
before
morning
he
had
decided
to
give
steel
a
chance
it
was
a
vague
decision
dependent
on
the
chance
that
steel
gave
him
when
they
met
as
meet
they
must
meanwhile
langholm
had
some
cause
for
satisfaction
with
the
mere
resolve
it
defined
the
line
that
he
took
with
a
somewhat
absurd
but
equally
startling
visitor
who
waited
upon
him
early
in
the
forenoon
in
the
person
of
the
chief
constable
of
northborough
this
worthy
had
heard
of
langholm
quest
and
desired
to
be
informed
of
what
success
if
any
he
had
met
with
up
to
the
present
langholm
opened
his
eyes
it
my
own
show
he
protested
would
you
say
that
if
you
had
got
the
man
i
doubt
it
would
be
our
show
then
wheezed
the
chief
constable
who
was
enormously
fat
it
would
be
scotland
yard
admitted
langholm
perhaps
unless
you
got
him
up
here
suggested
the
fat
official
in
that
case
you
would
naturally
come
to
me
langholm
met
his
eyes
they
were
very
small
and
bright
as
the
eyes
of
the
obese
often
are
or
as
they
seem
by
contrast
with
a
large
crass
face
langholm
fancied
he
perceived
a
glimmer
of
his
own
enlightenment
and
instinctively
he
lied
we
are
not
likely
to
get
him
up
here
he
said
this
is
about
the
last
place
where
i
should
look
the
chief
constable
took
his
departure
with
a
curious
smile
langholm
began
to
feel
uneasy
his
unforeseen
sympathy
with
steel
assumed
the
form
of
an
actual
fear
on
his
behalf
severino
was
another
thorn
in
his
side
he
knew
that
rachel
had
been
written
to
and
fell
into
a
fever
of
impatience
and
despair
because
the
morning
did
not
bring
her
to
his
bedside
she
was
not
coming
at
all
she
had
refused
to
come
or
her
husband
would
not
allow
it
so
he
must
die
without
seeing
her
again
the
man
was
as
unreasonable
as
sick
men
will
be
nothing
would
console
him
but
langholm
undertaking
to
go
to
normanthorpe
himself
after
lunch
and
plead
in
person
with
the
lady
or
her
tyrannical
lord
this
plan
suited
langholm
well
enough
it
would
pave
the
way
to
the
chance
which
he
had
resolved
to
give
to
rachel
husband
that
resolve
was
not
weakened
by
successive
encounters
first
with
a
policeman
near
the
entrance
gates
next
with
a
trespasser
whom
langholm
rightly
took
for
another
policeman
in
plain
clothes
and
finally
with
the
woodgates
on
their
way
from
the
house
the
good
couple
welcomed
him
with
a
warmth
beyond
his
merits
oh
what
a
blessing
you
have
come
cried
morna
whose
kind
eyes
discovered
a
moisture
do
please
go
up
and
convince
steel
that
you
ca
be
rearrested
on
a
charge
on
which
you
have
already
been
tried
and
acquitted
but
of
course
you
ca
said
langholm
who
has
put
that
into
her
head
mrs
woodgate
the
place
is
hemmed
in
by
police
since
when
asked
langholm
quickly
only
this
morning
langholm
held
his
tongue
so
the
extortioner
abel
outwitted
by
the
amateur
policeman
had
gone
straight
to
the
professional
force
the
amateur
had
not
suspected
him
of
such
resource
i
do
think
this
has
anything
to
do
with
steel
he
said
at
last
in
fact
i
think
i
know
what
it
means
and
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
to
reassure
her
if
i
can
but
his
own
face
was
not
reassuring
as
hugh
woodgate
plainly
told
him
in
the
first
words
which
the
vicar
contributed
to
the
discussion
i
have
been
finding
out
things
i
have
not
been
altogether
unsuccessful
but
the
things
are
rather
on
my
mind
the
author
explained
how
does
steel
take
the
development
by
the
way
as
a
joke
cried
morna
with
indignation
her
husband
was
her
echo
both
as
to
words
and
tone
but
langholm
could
only
stare
i
must
see
him
he
exclaimed
decisively
by
the
way
once
more
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
steel
got
a
letter
from
me
this
morning
mrs
woodgate
yes
she
did
answered
morna
at
once
her
manner
declared
her
to
be
not
unacquainted
with
the
contents
of
the
letter
and
langholm
treated
the
declaration
as
though
spoken
and
is
she
not
going
to
see
that
poor
fellow
he
asked
at
once
said
morna
and
i
am
going
with
her
she
is
to
call
for
me
with
the
phaeton
at
three
do
you
know
anything
about
him
mrs
woodgate
all
then
i
can
only
commend
him
to
the
sympathy
which
i
know
he
has
already
and
i
will
talk
to
steel
while
you
are
gone
the
first
sentence
was
almost
mechanical
that
matter
was
off
mind
and
in
a
flash
it
was
fully
occupied
with
the
prospect
before
himself
he
lifted
the
peak
of
his
cap
but
instead
of
remounting
his
bicycle
he
wheeled
it
very
slowly
up
the
drive
the
phaeton
was
at
the
door
when
langholm
also
arrived
and
rachel
herself
ran
out
to
greet
him
on
the
steps
tall
and
lissome
in
a
driving
cloak
down
to
her
heels
and
a
charming
hat
yet
under
it
a
face
still
years
older
than
the
one
he
wore
in
his
heart
though
no
less
beautiful
in
its
distress
i
hardly
dare
ask
you
she
gasped
her
hand
trembling
in
his
have
you
found
out
anything
at
all
a
little
and
he
opened
his
hand
so
that
hers
must
drop
oh
but
anything
is
better
than
nothing
come
in
and
tell
me
quick
bravo
added
an
amused
voice
from
the
porch
it
was
steel
spruce
and
serene
as
ever
a
pink
glow
upon
his
mobile
face
a
pink
flower
in
his
reefer
jacket
a
jaunty
panama
straw
covering
his
white
hairs
and
buckskin
shoes
of
kindred
purity
upon
his
small
and
feet
langholm
greeted
him
in
turn
only
trusting
that
the
tremors
which
had
been
instantly
communicated
to
his
own
right
hand
might
not
be
detected
by
the
one
it
was
now
compelled
to
meet
i
came
to
tell
steel
said
langholm
a
little
lamely
excellent
murmured
that
gentleman
with
his
smile
but
am
i
not
to
hear
also
demanded
rachel
my
dear
steel
there
is
very
little
to
tell
you
as
yet
i
only
wish
there
were
more
but
one
or
two
little
points
there
are
if
you
would
not
mind
my
first
mentioning
them
to
your
husband
oh
of
course
there
was
no
pique
in
the
tone
there
was
only
disappointment
and
despair
you
manage
a
woman
very
prettily
remarked
steel
as
they
watched
the
phaeton
diminish
down
the
drive
like
a
narrow
roman
road
you
are
the
first
who
ever
said
so
rejoined
the
novelist
with
a
rather
heavy
sigh
well
let
us
have
a
cigar
and
your
news
i
confess
i
am
interested
a
stroll
too
would
be
pleasanter
than
sitting
indoors
do
you
think
the
thickest
walls
have
long
ears
langholm
when
every
servant
in
the
place
is
under
notice
the
whole
lot
oh
dear
yes
every
mother
son
and
daughter
of
them
it
is
most
amusing
every
one
of
them
wants
to
stay
and
be
forgiven
the
neighbors
are
little
better
the
excuses
they
have
stooped
to
make
some
of
them
i
suppose
they
thought
that
we
should
either
flee
the
country
or
give
them
the
sanguinary
satisfaction
of
a
double
suicide
well
we
are
not
going
to
do
either
one
or
the
other
we
are
agreed
about
that
if
about
nothing
else
and
my
wife
has
behaved
like
a
trump
though
she
would
like
to
hear
me
say
so
it
is
her
wish
that
we
should
sit
tighter
than
if
nothing
had
happened
and
not
even
go
to
switzerland
as
we
intended
so
we
are
advertising
for
a
fresh
domestic
crew
and
we
dine
at
ireby
the
week
after
next
it
is
true
that
we
got
the
invitation
before
the
fat
fell
into
the
fire
but
i
fancy
we
may
trust
the
invernesses
not
to
do
anything
startling
i
am
interested
however
to
see
what
they
will
do
it
is
pretty
safe
to
be
an
to
the
countryside
one
way
or
the
other
during
this
monologue
the
pair
had
strolled
far
afield
with
their
cigars
and
langholm
was
beginning
to
puff
his
furiously
at
first
he
had
merely
marvelled
at
the
other
coolness
now
every
feeling
in
his
breast
was
outraged
by
the
callousness
the
flippancy
the
cynicism
of
his
companion
there
came
a
moment
when
langholm
could
endure
the
combination
no
longer
steel
seemed
disposed
to
discuss
every
aspect
of
the
subject
except
that
of
the
investigations
upon
which
his
very
life
might
depend
langholm
glanced
at
him
in
horror
as
they
walked
the
broad
brim
of
his
panama
hat
threw
his
face
in
shadow
to
the
neck
but
to
langholm
heated
imagination
it
was
the
shadow
of
the
black
cap
and
of
the
rope
itself
that
he
saw
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
it
was
the
shadow
that
had
lit
upon
the
wife
the
year
before
happily
to
lift
forever
now
it
was
settling
upon
the
husband
and
it
rested
with
langholm
if
it
did
rest
with
him
and
how
could
he
be
sure
his
mind
was
off
at
a
tangent
he
was
not
listening
to
steel
without
ceremony
he
interrupted
at
last
i
thought
you
came
out
to
listen
to
me
my
dear
fellow
cried
steel
and
so
to
be
sure
i
did
why
on
earth
did
you
let
me
rattle
on
let
me
see
the
point
was
ah
yes
of
course
my
dear
langholm
you
have
really
anything
of
any
account
to
tell
i
considered
you
a
quixote
when
you
undertook
your
quest
but
i
shall
begin
to
suspect
a
dash
of
munchausen
if
you
tell
me
you
have
found
out
anything
in
the
inside
of
a
week
nevertheless
said
langholm
grimly
i
have
anything
worth
finding
out
i
think
so
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
you
have
struck
a
clew
i
believe
i
can
lay
hands
upon
the
criminal
said
langholm
as
quietly
as
he
could
but
he
was
the
more
nervous
man
of
the
two
the
other
simply
stood
still
and
stared
his
incredulity
the
stare
melted
into
a
smile
my
dear
fellow
he
murmured
in
a
mild
blend
of
horror
and
reproof
as
though
it
were
the
fourth
dimension
that
langholm
claimed
to
have
discovered
it
cost
the
discoverer
no
small
effort
not
to
cry
out
that
he
could
lay
hands
on
him
then
and
there
the
unspoken
words
were
gulped
down
and
a
simple
repetition
substituted
at
the
last
i
could
swear
to
him
myself
added
langholm
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
there
is
evidence
enough
to
convict
have
you
communicated
with
the
police
not
yet
they
seem
to
have
some
absurd
bee
in
their
helmet
down
here
you
know
they
do
get
it
from
me
it
was
impossible
any
longer
to
doubt
the
import
of
langholm
earnest
and
rather
agitated
manner
he
was
doing
his
best
to
suppress
his
agitation
but
that
strengthened
the
impression
that
he
had
indeed
discovered
something
which
he
himself
honestly
believed
to
be
the
truth
there
was
an
immediate
alteration
in
the
tone
and
bearing
of
his
host
my
dear
fellow
he
said
forgive
my
levity
if
you
have
really
found
out
anything
it
is
a
miracle
but
miracles
do
happen
now
and
then
here
the
pond
and
there
the
boathouse
behind
those
rhododendrons
suppose
you
tell
me
the
rest
in
the
boat
we
need
keep
looking
over
our
shoulders
in
the
middle
of
the
pond
for
an
instant
langholm
dreamt
of
the
readiest
and
the
vilest
resource
in
another
he
remembered
not
only
that
he
could
swim
but
the
insidious
sympathy
for
this
man
which
a
darker
scoundrel
had
sown
in
his
heart
it
had
grown
there
like
jonah
gourd
only
his
flippancy
affected
it
and
steel
was
far
from
flippant
now
langholm
signed
to
him
to
lead
the
way
and
in
a
very
few
minutes
they
were
scaring
the
wildfowl
in
steel
sculling
from
the
after
thwart
while
langholm
faced
him
from
the
crimson
cushions
i
thought
said
the
latter
that
i
would
like
to
tell
you
what
sort
of
evidence
i
could
get
against
him
before
before
going
any
further
i
i
thought
it
would
be
fair
steel
raised
his
bushy
eyebrows
the
fraction
of
an
inch
it
would
be
fairest
to
yourself
i
agree
two
heads
are
better
than
one
and
well
i
open
to
conviction
still
of
course
but
even
langholm
was
not
conscious
of
the
sinister
play
upon
words
he
had
taken
out
his
and
was
nervously
turning
to
the
leaves
that
he
had
filled
during
his
most
sleepless
night
in
town
got
it
all
down
said
steel
yes
replied
langholm
without
raising
his
eyes
at
least
i
did
make
some
notes
of
a
possible
if
not
a
really
damning
case
against
the
man
i
mean
and
what
may
the
first
point
be
inquired
steel
who
was
gradually
drifting
back
into
the
tone
which
langholm
had
resented
on
the
shore
he
took
no
notice
of
it
now
the
first
point
said
langholm
slowly
is
that
he
was
in
chelsea
or
at
least
within
a
mile
of
the
scene
of
the
murder
on
the
night
that
it
took
place
so
were
a
good
many
people
remarked
steel
smiling
as
he
dipped
the
sculls
in
and
out
and
let
his
supple
wrists
fall
for
the
feather
as
though
he
were
really
rowing
but
he
left
his
he
was
out
at
the
time
declared
langholm
making
his
amended
statement
with
all
the
meaning
it
had
for
himself
well
you
ca
hang
him
for
that
he
will
have
to
prove
where
he
was
then
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
for
you
to
prove
a
little
more
first
langholm
sat
very
dogged
with
his
notes
there
had
been
a
pause
on
steel
part
there
was
a
thin
new
note
in
his
voice
langholm
was
too
grimly
engrossed
to
take
immediate
heed
of
either
detail
or
to
watch
the
swift
changes
in
the
face
which
was
watching
him
and
there
he
lost
most
of
all
the
next
point
is
that
he
undoubtedly
knew
minchin
in
australia
aha
that
he
was
and
is
a
rich
man
whereas
minchin
was
then
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
and
that
minchin
only
found
out
that
he
was
in
england
hours
before
his
own
death
when
he
wrote
to
his
old
friend
for
funds
and
you
have
really
established
all
that
steel
had
abandoned
all
pretence
of
rowing
his
tone
was
one
of
admiration
in
both
senses
of
the
word
and
his
dark
eyes
seemed
to
penetrate
to
the
back
of
langholm
brain
i
can
establish
it
was
the
reply
well
i
think
you
have
done
wonders
but
you
will
have
to
do
something
more
before
they
will
listen
to
you
at
scotland
yard
what
about
a
motive
i
was
coming
to
that
it
is
the
last
point
with
which
i
shall
trouble
you
for
the
present
langholm
took
a
final
glance
at
his
notes
then
shut
the
and
put
it
away
the
motive
he
continued
meeting
steel
eyes
at
last
with
a
new
boldness
in
his
own
the
motive
is
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
there
can
not
be
the
slightest
doubt
that
minchin
intended
blackmailing
this
man
at
least
to
the
extent
of
his
own
indebtedness
in
the
city
of
london
blackmailing
him
there
was
a
further
change
of
voice
and
manner
and
this
time
nothing
was
lost
upon
charles
langholm
there
can
not
be
the
slightest
doubt
he
reiterated
that
minchin
was
in
possession
of
a
secret
concerning
the
man
in
my
mind
which
secret
he
was
determined
to
use
for
his
own
ends
steel
sat
motionless
his
eyes
upon
the
bottom
of
the
boat
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
read
the
lowered
face
even
when
at
length
he
raised
it
and
looked
langholm
in
the
eyes
once
more
the
natural
inscrutability
of
the
man
was
only
more
complete
than
ever
so
that
is
your
case
said
he
and
even
his
tone
might
have
been
inspired
either
by
awe
or
by
contempt
so
truly
rang
the
note
between
the
two
i
should
be
sorry
to
have
to
meet
it
observed
langholm
if
i
were
he
i
should
find
out
a
little
more
was
the
retort
if
i
were
you
and
then
oh
then
i
should
do
my
duty
like
a
man
and
take
all
the
emoluments
i
could
the
sneer
was
intolerable
langholm
turned
the
color
of
brick
i
shall
said
he
through
his
mustache
i
have
consulted
you
there
will
be
no
need
to
do
so
again
i
shall
make
a
point
of
taking
you
at
your
word
and
now
do
you
mind
putting
me
ashore
a
few
raindrops
were
falling
when
they
reached
the
they
hurried
to
the
house
to
find
that
langholm
bicycle
had
been
removed
from
the
place
where
he
had
left
it
by
the
front
entrance
do
let
anybody
trouble
he
said
ungraciously
enough
for
he
was
still
smarting
from
the
other
sneer
i
can
soon
find
it
for
myself
steel
stood
on
the
steps
his
midnight
eyes
upon
langholm
the
glint
of
a
smile
in
those
eyes
but
not
the
vestige
of
one
upon
his
lips
oh
very
well
said
he
you
know
the
near
the
they
have
probably
put
it
in
the
first
room
on
the
left
that
is
where
we
keep
ours
for
we
have
gone
in
for
them
at
last
langholm
remember
my
advice
and
that
no
ceremony
should
be
lost
between
them
the
host
turned
on
his
heel
and
disappeared
through
his
own
front
door
leaving
langholm
very
angry
in
the
rain
but
anger
was
the
last
emotion
for
such
an
hour
the
judge
might
as
well
feel
exasperated
with
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
the
common
hangman
with
the
felon
on
the
drop
langholm
only
wished
that
on
even
one
reflection
he
could
rest
content
in
so
primitive
and
so
single
a
state
of
mind
he
knew
well
that
he
could
not
and
that
every
subtle
sort
of
contest
lay
before
him
his
own
soul
the
arena
in
the
meantime
let
him
find
his
bicycle
and
get
away
from
this
dear
and
accursed
spot
for
dear
it
had
been
to
him
all
that
too
memorable
summer
but
now
of
a
surety
the
curse
of
cain
brooded
over
its
cold
white
walls
and
windows
like
sunken
eyes
in
a
dead
face
langholm
found
the
room
to
which
he
had
been
directed
in
fact
he
knew
it
of
old
and
there
were
the
two
new
beeston
humbers
but
their
lustrous
plating
and
immaculate
enamel
did
not
shame
his
own
old
disreputable
roadster
for
the
missing
machine
certainly
was
not
there
langholm
was
turning
away
when
the
glazed
caught
his
eye
yes
this
was
the
room
in
which
the
guns
were
kept
he
had
often
seen
them
there
they
had
never
interested
him
before
langholm
was
no
shot
yet
now
he
peered
through
the
glass
gasped
and
opened
one
of
the
sliding
panels
with
trembling
hand
there
on
a
nail
hung
an
old
revolver
out
of
place
rusty
most
conspicuous
and
at
a
glance
as
like
the
relic
in
the
black
museum
as
one
pea
to
another
but
langholm
took
it
down
to
make
sure
and
the
maker
name
upon
the
barrel
was
the
name
that
he
had
noted
down
at
the
black
museum
the
point
gained
the
last
of
the
cardinal
points
postulated
by
the
official
who
had
shown
him
round
the
fortuitous
discoverer
of
them
all
was
leaving
like
a
thief
more
and
more
did
langholm
feel
himself
the
criminal
when
the
inner
door
opened
and
steel
himself
stood
beaming
sardonically
upon
him
sorry
langholm
but
i
find
i
misled
you
about
the
bicycle
they
had
taken
it
to
the
stables
i
have
told
them
to
bring
it
round
to
the
front
thank
you
sure
you
wo
wait
till
the
rain
is
over
no
thank
you
well
wo
you
come
through
this
way
no
thank
you
oh
all
right
langholm
remember
my
advice
it
was
an
inglorious
exit
that
langholm
made
but
he
was
thinking
to
himself
was
there
ever
so
inglorious
a
triumph
he
knew
not
what
he
had
said
there
was
only
one
thing
that
he
did
know
but
was
the
law
itself
capable
of
coping
with
such
a
man
chapter
xxvii
the
whole
truth
have
the
ladies
gone
langholm
had
ridden
a
long
way
round
through
the
rain
in
order
to
avoid
them
nor
was
there
any
sign
of
the
phaeton
in
the
lane
yet
these
were
his
first
whispered
words
across
the
wicket
and
he
would
not
venture
to
set
foot
upon
the
noisy
wet
gravel
without
assurance
that
the
ladies
had
been
gone
some
time
and
they
left
him
a
different
man
she
added
but
what
have
you
been
doing
to
get
wet
like
that
dear
dear
dear
i
do
call
it
foolish
of
yer
well
sir
get
out
o
them
nasty
wet
things
or
i
shall
have
you
to
nurse
an
all
the
kind
blunt
soul
bustled
to
bring
him
a
large
can
of
scalding
water
and
langholm
bathed
and
changed
before
going
near
the
invalid
he
also
felt
another
man
the
thorough
wetting
had
cooled
his
spirit
and
calmed
his
nerves
his
head
still
ached
for
sleep
but
now
it
was
clear
enough
if
only
his
duty
were
half
as
plain
as
the
mystery
that
was
one
no
more
yet
it
was
something
to
have
solved
the
prime
problem
nay
everything
since
it
freed
his
mind
for
concentration
upon
his
own
immediate
course
but
langholm
reckoned
without
his
stricken
guest
next
door
and
went
up
presently
intending
to
stay
five
or
ten
minutes
at
the
most
severino
lay
smiling
like
a
happy
and
excited
child
langholm
was
sorry
to
detect
the
excitement
but
determined
to
cut
his
own
visit
shorter
than
ever
it
was
more
pleasing
to
him
to
note
how
neat
and
comfortable
the
room
was
now
for
that
was
his
own
handiwork
and
the
ladies
had
been
there
to
see
it
the
good
bruntons
had
moved
most
of
their
things
into
the
room
to
which
they
had
themselves
migrated
in
their
stead
were
other
things
which
langholm
had
unearthed
from
the
lumber
in
his
upper
story
dusted
and
carried
down
and
up
with
his
own
hands
thus
at
the
bedside
stood
a
real
chippendale
table
with
a
real
delft
vase
upon
it
filled
with
such
roses
as
had
survived
the
rain
a
drop
of
water
had
been
spilt
upon
the
table
from
the
vase
and
there
was
something
almost
fussy
in
the
way
that
langholm
removed
it
with
his
handkerchief
oh
said
severino
she
quite
fell
in
love
with
the
table
you
found
for
me
and
woodgate
wanted
the
vase
they
were
wondering
if
brunton
would
accept
a
price
they
do
belong
to
brunton
said
langholm
shortly
no
woodgate
said
she
had
never
noticed
them
in
your
room
where
did
you
pick
them
up
langholm
looked
at
the
things
lamps
of
remembrance
alight
beneath
his
lowered
eyelids
the
table
came
from
a
little
shop
on
bushey
heath
in
hertfordshire
you
know
we
i
was
spending
the
day
there
once
you
had
to
stoop
to
get
in
at
the
door
i
remember
the
vase
is
only
from
great
portland
street
the
prices
were
upon
his
lips
both
had
been
bargains
a
passing
happiness
and
pride
i
must
remember
to
tell
them
when
they
come
said
severino
they
are
the
sort
of
thing
a
woman
likes
they
are
agreed
langholm
his
lowered
eyes
still
lingering
on
the
table
and
the
vase
the
sort
of
thing
a
woman
likes
so
these
women
are
coming
again
are
they
the
question
was
quite
brisk
when
it
came
yes
they
promised
both
of
them
eh
yes
i
hope
so
the
sick
man
broke
into
eager
explanations
i
only
want
to
see
her
langholm
that
all
i
want
i
do
want
her
to
myself
what
is
the
good
to
see
her
and
be
with
her
is
all
i
want
ever
it
has
made
me
so
happy
it
is
really
better
than
if
she
came
alone
you
see
as
it
is
i
ca
say
anything
that
matters
do
you
see
perfectly
said
langholm
gently
the
lad
lay
gazing
up
at
him
with
great
eyes
langholm
fancied
their
expression
was
one
of
incredulity
twilight
was
falling
early
with
the
rain
the
casement
was
small
and
further
contracted
by
an
overgrowth
of
creeper
those
two
great
eyes
seemed
to
shine
the
brighter
through
the
dusk
langholm
could
not
make
his
visit
a
very
short
one
after
all
he
felt
it
would
be
cruel
what
did
you
talk
about
then
he
asked
a
small
smile
came
with
the
answer
you
me
what
on
earth
had
you
to
say
about
me
i
heard
all
you
had
been
doing
oh
that
you
know
you
did
tell
me
that
evening
in
town
no
i
was
only
beginning
then
it
seemed
some
months
ago
more
months
since
that
very
afternoon
have
you
found
out
anything
langholm
hesitated
yes
why
should
he
lie
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
any
suspicion
who
it
is
severino
was
on
his
elbow
more
than
a
suspicion
i
am
certain
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
a
pure
fluke
gave
me
the
clew
but
every
mortal
thing
fits
it
severino
dropped
back
upon
his
pillow
langholm
seemed
glad
to
talk
to
him
to
loosen
his
tongue
to
unburden
his
heart
ever
so
little
and
indeed
he
was
glad
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
that
my
difficulty
she
must
be
cleared
before
the
world
that
is
the
first
duty
if
it
could
be
done
without
making
bad
almost
worse
bad
worse
how
could
it
langholm
no
answer
who
do
you
say
it
is
no
answer
again
langholm
had
not
bargained
to
say
anything
to
anybody
just
yet
severino
raised
himself
once
more
upon
an
elbow
i
must
know
he
said
langholm
rose
laughing
i
tell
you
who
i
thought
it
was
at
first
said
he
heartily
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
because
it
was
so
absurd
and
i
think
you
be
the
first
to
laugh
at
it
i
was
idiot
enough
to
think
it
might
be
you
my
poor
dear
chap
and
you
do
think
so
still
asked
severino
harshly
he
had
not
been
the
first
to
laugh
of
course
i
do
my
dear
fellow
i
wish
you
would
sit
down
again
that
better
so
you
know
it
is
some
one
else
so
far
as
one
can
know
anything
and
you
are
going
to
try
to
bring
it
home
to
this
man
i
do
know
the
police
may
save
me
the
trouble
i
believe
they
are
on
the
same
scent
at
last
meanwhile
i
have
given
him
as
fair
a
warning
as
a
man
could
wish
severino
lay
back
yet
again
in
silence
and
deep
twilight
his
breath
came
quickly
a
shiver
seemed
to
pass
through
the
bed
you
need
have
done
that
he
whispered
at
last
i
thought
it
was
the
fair
thing
to
do
yet
you
need
have
done
it
because
your
first
idea
was
right
illustration
i
tell
you
who
i
thought
it
was
at
first
said
he
heartily
right
echoed
langholm
densely
my
first
idea
was
right
you
said
you
first
thought
it
was
i
who
killed
her
husband
it
could
have
been
but
it
was
langholm
got
back
to
his
feet
he
could
conceive
but
one
explanation
of
this
preposterous
statement
severino
sickness
had
extended
to
his
brain
he
was
delirious
this
was
the
first
sign
where
are
you
going
asked
the
invalid
querulously
as
his
companion
moved
towards
the
door
when
was
the
doctor
here
last
demanded
langholm
in
return
there
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
and
then
a
faint
laugh
that
threatened
to
break
into
a
sob
from
the
bed
i
see
what
you
think
how
can
i
convince
you
that
i
have
all
my
wits
about
me
i
rather
not
have
a
light
just
yet
but
in
my
bag
find
a
it
is
locked
but
the
keys
are
in
my
pocket
in
my
you
will
find
a
sealed
envelope
and
in
that
a
fuller
confession
than
i
shall
have
breath
to
make
to
you
take
it
downstairs
and
glance
at
it
then
come
back
no
no
said
langholm
hoarsely
no
i
believe
you
yes
it
was
my
first
idea
i
hardly
knew
what
i
was
doing
severino
whispered
i
was
delirious
then
if
you
like
yet
i
remember
it
better
than
anything
else
in
all
my
life
i
have
never
forgotten
it
for
an
hour
since
it
first
came
back
you
really
were
unconscious
for
days
afterwards
i
believe
it
was
weeks
otherwise
you
must
know
she
will
be
the
first
to
believe
i
never
could
have
let
her
my
poor
dear
fellow
of
course
of
course
langholm
felt
for
the
emaciated
hand
and
stroked
it
as
though
it
had
been
a
child
yet
that
was
the
hand
that
had
slain
alexander
minchin
and
langholm
thought
of
it
and
still
his
own
was
almost
womanly
in
the
tender
pity
of
its
touch
i
want
to
tell
you
the
sick
lad
murmured
i
wanted
to
tell
her
god
knows
it
and
that
alone
was
why
i
came
to
her
the
moment
i
could
find
out
where
she
was
no
no
not
that
alone
i
am
too
ill
to
pretend
any
more
it
was
not
all
pretence
when
i
let
you
think
it
was
only
passion
that
drove
me
down
here
i
believe
i
should
have
come
even
if
i
had
had
nothing
at
all
to
tell
her
only
to
be
near
her
as
i
was
this
afternoon
but
the
other
made
it
a
duty
yet
when
she
came
this
afternoon
i
could
not
do
my
duty
i
had
not
the
courage
it
was
too
big
a
thing
just
to
be
with
her
again
and
then
the
other
lady
i
thanked
god
for
her
too
for
she
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
speak
but
to
you
i
must
especially
after
what
you
say
the
man
came
out
in
langholm
ministrations
one
minute
he
said
and
returned
in
two
or
three
with
a
pint
of
tolerable
champagne
i
keep
a
few
for
angel
visits
he
explained
but
i
am
afraid
i
must
light
the
candle
i
will
put
it
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
do
you
mind
the
tumbler
now
drink
and
tell
me
only
what
you
feel
inclined
neither
more
nor
less
it
is
all
written
down
began
severino
in
better
voice
for
the
first
few
drams
how
i
first
heard
her
singing
through
the
open
windows
in
the
summer
only
last
summer
how
she
heard
me
playing
and
how
afterwards
we
came
to
meet
she
was
unhappy
he
was
a
bad
husband
but
i
only
saw
it
for
myself
he
was
nice
enough
to
me
in
his
way
liked
to
send
round
for
me
to
play
when
they
had
anybody
there
but
there
was
only
one
reason
why
i
went
oh
yes
the
ground
she
trod
on
the
air
she
breathed
i
make
no
secret
of
it
now
if
i
made
any
then
it
was
because
i
knew
her
too
well
and
feared
to
lose
what
i
had
got
and
yet
that
brute
that
bully
that
coarse
he
checked
himself
by
an
effort
that
stained
his
face
a
sickly
brown
in
the
light
of
the
distant
candle
langholm
handed
him
the
tumbler
and
a
few
more
drams
went
down
to
do
the
only
good
the
temporary
good
that
human
aid
could
do
for
severino
now
his
eyes
brightened
he
lay
still
and
silent
collecting
strength
and
i
was
ill
she
brought
me
flowers
i
never
had
any
constitution
trust
a
latin
race
for
that
and
i
became
very
ill
indeed
with
a
man
like
you
a
chill
at
worst
with
me
pneumonia
in
a
day
then
she
came
to
see
me
herself
saw
the
doctor
got
in
all
sorts
of
things
and
was
coming
to
nurse
me
through
the
night
herself
god
bless
her
for
the
thought
alone
i
was
supposed
not
to
know
they
thought
i
was
unconscious
already
but
i
kept
conscious
on
purpose
i
could
have
lived
through
anything
for
that
alone
and
she
never
came
my
landlady
sat
up
instead
she
is
another
of
the
kindest
women
on
earth
she
thought
far
more
of
me
than
i
was
ever
worth
and
it
was
she
who
screened
me
through
thick
and
thin
during
the
delirium
that
followed
and
after
that
she
did
not
tell
the
whole
truth
at
the
trial
may
there
be
no
mercy
for
me
hereafter
if
the
law
is
not
merciful
to
that
staunch
soul
she
has
saved
my
life
for
this
but
that
night
it
was
her
second
in
succession
and
she
had
been
with
me
the
whole
long
day
that
night
she
fell
asleep
beside
me
in
the
chair
i
can
hear
her
breathing
now
dear
soul
how
it
angered
me
at
the
time
it
made
me
fret
all
the
more
for
her
why
had
she
broken
faith
i
knew
that
she
had
not
something
had
kept
her
had
he
i
had
hoped
he
was
out
of
the
way
he
left
her
so
much
he
was
really
on
the
watch
as
you
may
know
at
last
i
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
and
all
the
windows
opposite
were
in
darkness
except
theirs
langholm
sprang
to
his
feet
but
sat
down
again
as
suddenly
go
on
what
is
it
that
you
thought
langholm
i
believe
i
know
what
you
did
that
all
what
tell
me
please
and
then
i
will
tell
you
all
those
garden
walls
they
connect
yes
yes
you
got
through
your
window
climbed
upon
your
wall
and
ran
along
to
the
lights
it
occurred
to
you
suddenly
it
did
to
me
when
i
went
over
the
house
the
other
day
severino
lay
looking
at
the
imaginative
man
and
yet
you
could
suspect
another
after
that
ah
there
is
some
mystery
there
also
but
it
is
strange
indeed
to
think
that
i
was
right
in
the
beginning
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
doing
resumed
the
young
italian
who
like
many
a
clever
foreigner
spoke
more
precise
english
than
any
englishman
that
with
an
accent
too
delicate
for
written
reproduction
alone
would
have
betrayed
him
i
still
have
very
little
recollection
of
what
happened
between
my
climbing
out
of
our
garden
and
dropping
into
theirs
i
remember
that
my
feet
were
rather
cold
but
that
is
about
all
it
was
near
midnight
as
you
know
and
the
room
it
happened
in
the
study
had
the
brightest
light
of
all
an
electric
lamp
was
blazing
on
the
at
the
window
and
another
from
a
bracket
among
the
books
the
window
was
as
wide
open
as
it
would
go
the
lower
sash
thrown
right
up
it
was
just
above
the
scullery
window
which
is
half
underground
and
has
an
outside
grating
the
sill
was
only
the
height
of
one
chin
i
can
tell
you
all
that
now
but
at
the
time
i
knew
very
little
until
i
was
in
the
room
itself
thank
you
i
will
take
another
sip
it
does
me
more
good
than
harm
to
tell
you
but
you
will
find
it
all
written
down
langholm
set
down
the
glass
and
replenished
it
the
night
had
fallen
without
the
single
candle
in
the
farthest
corner
supplied
the
only
light
in
it
the
one
man
sat
and
the
other
lay
their
eyes
locked
i
spilt
the
ink
as
i
was
creeping
over
the
desk
that
is
an
odd
thing
to
remember
but
i
was
looking
for
something
to
wipe
it
up
with
when
i
heard
their
voices
upstairs
you
heard
them
both
yes
quarrelling
and
about
me
the
first
thing
i
heard
was
my
own
name
then
the
man
came
running
down
but
i
never
tried
to
get
away
the
doors
were
all
open
i
had
heard
something
else
and
i
waited
to
tell
him
what
a
liar
he
was
but
i
turned
out
the
lights
so
that
she
should
not
hear
the
outcry
and
sure
enough
he
shut
both
doors
behind
him
you
would
notice
there
were
two
before
he
turned
them
on
again
so
there
we
stood
let
her
hear
us
were
my
first
words
and
we
stood
and
cursed
each
other
under
our
breath
i
do
know
why
he
did
knock
me
down
or
rather
i
do
know
it
was
because
i
put
my
hands
behind
my
back
and
invited
him
to
do
it
i
was
as
furious
as
he
was
i
forgot
that
there
was
anything
the
matter
with
me
but
when
i
began
telling
him
that
there
had
been
he
looked
as
though
he
could
have
spat
in
my
face
it
was
no
use
going
on
i
could
not
expect
him
to
believe
a
word
at
last
he
told
me
to
sit
down
in
the
chair
opposite
his
chair
and
i
said
pleasure
then
he
said
better
have
a
drink
because
only
one
of
us
is
coming
out
of
this
room
alive
and
i
said
the
same
thing
again
he
was
full
of
drink
already
but
not
drunk
and
my
own
head
was
as
light
as
air
i
was
ready
for
anything
he
unlocked
a
drawer
and
took
a
brace
of
old
revolvers
from
the
case
in
which
i
put
them
away
again
i
locked
up
the
drawer
afterwards
and
put
his
keys
back
in
his
pocket
before
losing
my
head
and
doing
all
the
rest
that
the
police
saw
through
at
a
glance
sit
still
langholm
i
am
getting
the
cart
before
the
horse
i
was
not
so
guilty
as
you
think
they
may
hang
me
if
they
like
but
it
was
as
much
his
act
as
mine
he
stood
with
his
back
to
me
fiddling
with
the
revolvers
for
a
good
five
minutes
during
which
time
i
heard
him
tear
his
handkerchief
in
two
and
wondered
what
in
the
world
he
was
going
to
do
next
what
he
did
was
to
turn
round
and
go
on
fiddling
with
the
pistols
behind
his
back
then
he
held
out
one
in
each
hand
by
the
barrel
telling
me
to
take
my
choice
that
he
did
know
which
was
which
himself
but
only
one
of
them
was
loaded
and
he
had
lapped
the
two
halves
of
his
handkerchief
round
the
chambers
of
each
in
such
a
way
that
neither
of
us
could
tell
when
we
were
going
to
fire
then
he
tossed
for
first
shot
and
made
me
call
and
i
won
so
he
sat
down
in
his
chair
and
finished
his
drink
and
told
me
to
blaze
across
at
him
from
where
i
sat
in
the
other
chair
i
tried
to
get
out
of
it
partly
because
i
seemed
to
have
seen
more
good
in
minchin
in
those
last
ten
minutes
than
in
all
the
months
that
i
had
known
him
he
might
be
a
brute
but
he
was
a
british
brute
and
all
right
about
fair
play
besides
for
the
moment
it
was
difficult
to
believe
he
was
serious
or
even
very
angry
but
i
on
my
side
was
more
in
a
dream
than
not
or
he
would
not
have
managed
me
as
he
did
he
broke
out
again
cursed
me
and
his
wife
and
swore
that
he
would
shoot
her
too
if
i
did
go
through
with
it
you
ca
think
of
the
things
he
was
saying
when
but
i
believe
he
said
them
on
purpose
to
make
me
anyhow
i
pulled
at
last
but
there
was
only
a
click
and
he
answered
with
another
like
lightning
that
showed
me
how
he
meant
it
plainer
than
anything
else
it
was
too
late
to
get
out
i
set
my
teeth
and
pulled
again
like
the
clash
of
swords
whispered
langholm
in
the
pause
severino
moved
his
head
from
side
to
side
upon
the
pillow
no
not
that
time
langholm
there
was
such
a
report
as
might
have
roused
the
neighborhood
you
would
have
thought
but
i
forgot
to
tell
you
he
had
shut
the
window
and
run
up
some
shutters
and
even
drawn
the
curtains
to
do
for
the
other
houses
what
the
double
doors
did
for
his
own
when
the
smoke
lifted
he
was
lying
back
in
his
chair
as
though
he
had
fallen
asleep
i
think
the
worst
was
waiting
for
her
to
come
down
i
opened
both
doors
but
she
never
came
then
i
shut
them
very
quietly
and
utterly
lost
my
head
you
know
what
i
did
i
do
remember
doing
half
it
was
the
stupid
cunning
of
a
real
madman
the
broken
window
and
the
things
up
the
chimney
i
got
back
as
i
had
come
in
the
way
that
struck
you
as
possible
when
you
were
there
and
i
woke
my
landlady
getting
in
i
believe
i
told
her
everything
on
the
spot
and
that
it
was
the
last
sense
i
spoke
for
weeks
she
nursed
me
day
and
night
that
i
might
never
tell
anybody
else
so
the
story
ended
and
with
it
as
might
have
been
expected
the
unnatural
strength
which
had
sustained
the
teller
till
the
last
he
had
used
up
every
ounce
of
it
and
he
lay
exhausted
and
collapsed
langholm
became
uneasy
severino
could
not
swallow
the
champagne
which
langholm
poured
into
his
mouth
langholm
fetched
the
candle
in
high
alarm
higher
yet
at
what
it
revealed
severino
was
struggling
to
raise
himself
a
deadly
leaden
light
upon
his
face
raise
me
up
raise
me
up
langholm
raised
him
in
his
arms
another
hemorrhage
said
severino
in
a
gasping
whisper
and
his
blood
dripped
with
the
words
langholm
propped
him
up
and
rushed
out
shouting
for
brunton
for
brunton
for
anybody
in
the
house
both
were
in
and
the
woman
came
up
bravely
without
a
word
i
go
for
the
doctor
myself
said
langholm
i
shall
be
quickest
and
he
went
on
his
bicycle
hatless
with
an
unlit
lamp
but
the
doctor
came
too
late
chapter
xxviii
in
the
matter
of
a
motive
that
was
between
eight
and
nine
at
night
before
ten
an
outrageous
thought
occurred
to
the
man
with
the
undisciplined
imagination
it
closed
his
mind
to
the
tragedy
of
an
hour
ago
to
the
dead
man
lying
upstairs
whose
low
and
eager
voice
still
went
on
and
on
in
his
ears
it
was
a
thought
that
possessed
langholm
like
an
unclean
spirit
from
the
moment
in
which
he
raised
his
eyes
from
the
last
words
of
the
manuscript
to
which
the
dead
man
had
referred
in
the
long
low
room
that
langholm
lived
in
a
fire
was
necessary
in
damp
weather
irrespective
of
the
season
it
was
on
the
fire
that
his
eyes
fell
straight
from
the
paper
in
his
hand
no
one
else
had
read
it
there
was
an
explicit
assurance
on
the
point
the
chelsea
landlady
had
no
idea
that
such
a
statement
was
in
existence
she
would
certainly
have
destroyed
it
if
she
had
known
and
further
written
details
convinced
langholm
that
the
woman
would
never
speak
of
her
own
accord
there
were
strange
sidelights
on
the
feelings
which
the
young
italian
had
inspired
in
an
unlikely
breast
a
mother
could
have
done
no
more
to
shield
him
on
the
night
of
the
acquittal
for
example
when
he
was
slowly
recovering
in
her
house
it
had
since
come
to
the
writer
knowledge
that
this
woman
had
turned
minchin
from
her
door
with
a
lying
statement
as
to
his
whereabouts
this
he
mentioned
to
confirm
his
declaration
that
he
always
meant
to
tell
the
truth
to
rachel
that
it
was
his
first
resolve
in
the
early
stages
of
his
recovery
long
before
he
knew
of
her
arrest
and
trial
and
that
this
woman
was
aware
of
that
resolve
as
of
all
else
but
he
doubted
whether
she
could
be
made
to
speak
though
he
hoped
that
for
his
sake
she
would
and
langholm
grinned
with
set
teeth
as
he
turned
back
to
this
passage
he
would
be
diabolically
safe
it
was
only
an
evil
thought
he
did
not
admit
it
as
a
temptation
yet
how
it
stuck
and
how
it
grew
there
was
the
fire
as
though
lit
on
purpose
in
a
minute
the
written
evidence
could
be
destroyed
for
ever
and
there
was
no
other
kind
dead
men
tell
no
tales
and
live
men
only
those
that
suit
them
it
all
fitted
in
so
marvellously
to
a
villain
it
would
have
been
less
a
temptation
than
a
veritable
gift
of
his
ends
langholm
almost
wished
he
were
a
villain
there
was
steel
something
remained
for
explanation
there
but
there
really
was
a
case
against
him
the
villain
would
let
that
case
come
on
the
villain
did
so
in
his
own
ready
fancy
and
the
end
of
it
was
a
world
without
steel
but
not
without
his
wife
only
she
would
be
steel
wife
no
more
and
this
brought
langholm
to
his
senses
idiot
he
said
and
went
out
to
his
wet
paths
and
ruined
roses
but
the
ugly
impossible
idea
dogged
him
even
there
if
steel
had
been
guilty
but
he
is
i
tell
you
no
but
if
he
had
been
just
for
argument
would
she
ever
have
looked
hush
idiot
and
egotist
no
but
she
and
could
you
have
made
her
happy
if
she
had
ah
that
another
thing
i
wonder
it
is
worth
wondering
about
you
know
you
have
failed
before
yes
yes
yes
do
you
think
i
forget
it
no
but
i
must
remind
you
are
you
the
type
to
make
women
happy
women
with
anything
in
them
women
with
nerves
are
you
not
moody
morbid
uneven
full
of
yourself
no
of
my
work
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
for
the
woman
could
you
have
made
her
happy
yes
or
no
if
no
then
pull
yourself
together
and
never
think
of
it
is
it
always
better
to
be
the
good
friend
than
the
tiresome
husband
and
if
you
care
for
her
to
show
her
your
best
side
instead
of
all
your
sides
i
thought
so
then
thank
your
stars
and
never
again
so
the
two
voices
that
are
only
one
voice
within
langholm
that
night
in
the
heavy
fragrance
of
his
soaking
garden
under
the
eye
of
a
waning
moon
and
having
conquered
him
the
voice
of
sense
and
sanity
reminded
him
of
his
reward
remember
too
how
you
promised
to
serve
her
and
how
if
less
by
management
than
good
luck
you
have
after
all
performed
the
very
prodigy
you
undertook
go
and
tell
her
i
should
go
no
it
is
never
too
late
to
bring
good
news
i
should
jump
on
my
bicycle
and
go
now
the
old
moon
eye
drooped
also
over
normanthorpe
house
out
of
the
clearest
sky
that
there
had
been
for
days
the
steels
were
strolling
on
the
sweep
of
the
drive
before
the
house
out
for
outing
sake
for
the
first
time
that
day
and
together
for
the
sake
of
being
together
for
the
first
time
that
month
there
was
something
untoward
in
the
air
in
fact
there
was
suspicion
and
rachel
was
beginning
to
suspect
what
that
suspicion
was
she
could
not
say
absolutely
that
she
did
not
entertain
it
herself
for
a
single
instant
she
had
entertained
and
had
dismissed
the
thought
a
good
many
times
why
had
he
never
told
her
his
real
motive
in
marrying
her
some
subtle
motive
there
had
been
why
could
he
never
tell
her
what
it
was
then
there
was
his
intimacy
with
her
first
husband
which
she
had
only
discovered
by
chance
after
the
most
sedulous
concealment
on
his
part
and
finally
there
was
the
defiant
character
of
his
challenge
to
langholm
as
it
were
to
do
his
worst
not
his
best
as
a
detective
on
the
other
hand
there
was
that
woman
instinct
which
no
wise
woman
disregards
and
rachel
instinct
had
never
confirmed
her
fancies
in
this
matter
but
within
the
last
few
hours
her
point
of
view
had
totally
changed
her
husband
was
suspected
he
said
so
laughingly
himself
he
was
in
a
certain
danger
her
place
was
by
his
side
and
let
it
be
remembered
that
before
his
absolute
refusal
to
answer
her
crucial
question
about
his
prime
motive
for
the
marriage
rachel
had
grown
rather
to
like
that
place
they
had
been
strolling
quite
apart
though
chatting
amiably
rachel
had
not
dreamt
of
putting
her
hand
within
his
arm
as
she
had
sometimes
done
towards
the
end
before
their
quarrel
yet
she
did
it
again
now
the
very
moment
his
quicker
vision
descried
the
cyclist
in
the
drive
i
hope
they
are
not
going
to
run
me
in
he
said
if
they
do
i
shall
run
in
for
riding
without
a
light
so
it
langholm
well
langholm
put
salt
on
him
yet
on
whom
your
murderer
of
course
i
have
his
confession
in
my
pocket
it
was
the
first
time
that
rachel
had
known
her
husband
taken
visibly
aback
good
god
he
cried
then
you
do
think
it
me
any
longer
i
know
it
is
not
nevertheless
steel
must
prepare
for
a
shock
rachel
was
shocked
but
her
grief
and
horror
though
both
were
real
and
poignant
were
swept
away
for
that
hour
at
least
by
the
full
tide
of
her
joy
it
was
a
double
joy
not
only
would
rachel
be
cleared
for
ever
before
the
world
but
her
husband
would
stand
exonerated
at
her
side
the
day
of
unfounded
suspicions
of
either
one
of
them
by
the
other
or
by
the
world
that
day
at
least
was
over
once
for
all
her
heart
was
too
full
for
many
explanations
she
lingered
while
langholm
told
of
his
interview
with
abel
and
then
left
him
to
one
with
her
husband
alone
langholm
thereupon
spoke
more
openly
of
his
whole
case
against
steel
who
instantly
admitted
its
strength
but
i
owe
you
an
apology
the
latter
added
not
only
for
something
i
said
to
you
this
afternoon
more
in
mischief
than
in
malice
which
i
would
nevertheless
unsay
if
i
could
but
for
deliberately
manufacturing
the
last
link
in
your
chain
i
happened
to
buy
both
my
revolvers
and
minchin
from
a
hawker
up
the
country
his
were
a
present
from
me
and
as
they
say
out
there
one
pair
was
the
dead
spit
of
the
other
this
morning
when
i
found
i
was
being
shadowed
by
these
local
heroes
it
occurred
to
me
for
my
own
amusement
to
put
one
of
my
pair
in
a
thoroughly
conspicuous
place
and
this
afternoon
i
could
not
resist
sending
you
to
the
room
to
add
it
to
your
grand
discoveries
you
see
i
could
have
proved
an
alibi
for
the
weapon
at
all
events
during
my
trip
to
town
a
year
ago
yes
poor
minchin
wrote
to
me
and
i
went
up
to
town
by
the
next
train
to
take
him
by
surprise
how
you
got
to
know
of
his
letter
i
ca
conceive
but
it
carried
no
hint
of
blackmail
i
think
you
did
wonders
and
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
for
that
little
trap
it
really
was
set
for
you
it
is
also
perfectly
true
that
i
stayed
at
the
cadogan
and
was
out
at
that
particular
time
i
went
there
because
it
was
the
one
decent
hotel
i
knew
of
in
those
parts
which
was
probably
your
own
reason
and
i
was
out
reconnoitring
my
old
friend
house
because
i
knew
him
for
an
inveterate
and
he
did
not
write
as
though
marriage
had
improved
his
habits
in
fact
as
you
know
he
had
gone
to
the
dogs
altogether
this
reminded
langholm
of
the
hour
it
is
late
now
said
he
and
i
must
be
off
poor
severino
had
not
a
relation
in
this
country
that
i
know
of
there
will
be
a
great
deal
to
do
steel
at
once
insisted
on
bearing
all
expenses
that
would
be
the
lightest
part
he
said
you
have
done
so
much
he
added
by
the
way
you
ca
go
without
saying
to
my
wife
she
has
still
to
thank
you
i
do
want
to
be
thanked
but
for
you
the
truth
might
never
have
come
out
still
i
shall
be
much
happier
if
she
never
speaks
of
it
again
very
well
she
shall
not
on
one
condition
what
is
that
langholm
i
thought
last
summer
we
were
to
be
rather
friends
i
think
that
of
many
people
may
i
still
think
it
of
you
if
you
will
said
langholm
i
i
do
believe
i
ever
should
have
brought
myself
to
give
you
away
you
behaved
most
fairly
my
dear
fellow
i
shall
not
forget
it
nor
the
way
you
scored
off
the
blackmailer
abel
if
it
is
any
satisfaction
to
you
i
will
tell
you
what
his
secret
was
nay
i
may
as
well
and
my
wife
i
must
tell
her
too
though
all
these
months
i
have
hidden
it
from
her
but
i
have
no
doubt
he
took
it
to
the
police
when
you
failed
him
it
is
bound
to
get
about
but
i
can
live
it
down
as
i
did
the
thing
itself
langholm
like
many
a
better
man
i
left
my
country
for
my
country
good
never
mind
the
offence
the
curious
can
hunt
up
the
case
and
will
perhaps
admit
there
have
been
worse
but
that
man
and
i
were
transported
to
western
australia
on
the
same
vessel
in
and
yet
said
langholm
they
were
not
quite
his
next
words
and
yet
you
challenged
me
to
discover
the
truth
i
still
ca
understand
your
attitude
that
night
steel
stood
silent
some
day
i
may
explain
it
to
you
he
said
i
am
only
now
going
to
explain
it
to
my
wife
the
men
shook
hands
and
langholm
rode
on
his
bicycle
off
the
scene
of
the
one
real
melodrama
of
a
life
spent
in
inventing
fictitious
ones
and
if
you
ask
what
he
had
to
show
for
his
part
in
it
you
may
get
your
answer
one
day
from
his
work
not
from
the
masterpiece
which
he
used
to
talk
over
with
steel
for
it
will
never
be
written
not
from
any
particular
novel
or
story
much
less
in
the
reproduction
of
any
of
these
incidents
wherein
he
himself
played
so
dubious
a
part
but
perhaps
you
will
find
your
answer
in
a
deeper
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
a
stronger
grasp
of
the
realities
of
life
a
keener
sympathy
with
men
and
particularly
with
women
than
formerly
distinguished
this
writer
books
these
at
all
events
are
some
of
the
things
which
charles
langholm
has
to
show
if
he
will
only
show
them
and
in
the
meantime
you
are
requested
not
to
pity
him
steel
went
straight
to
his
wife
tears
were
still
in
her
eyes
but
such
tears
and
such
eyes
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
say
what
he
had
to
say
and
that
was
unusual
in
his
case
rachel
he
said
at
length
in
a
tone
as
new
as
his
reluctance
i
am
going
to
answer
the
question
which
you
have
so
often
asked
me
i
am
going
to
answer
it
with
perfect
honesty
and
very
possibly
you
will
never
speak
to
me
again
i
shall
be
sorry
for
both
our
sakes
if
you
do
anything
precipitate
but
in
any
case
you
shall
act
as
you
think
best
you
know
that
i
was
exceedingly
fond
of
alec
minchin
as
a
young
man
now
i
am
not
often
exceedingly
fond
of
anybody
as
you
may
also
know
by
this
time
before
your
trial
i
was
convinced
that
you
had
killed
my
old
friend
whom
i
was
so
keen
to
see
again
that
i
came
up
to
town
by
the
very
first
train
after
getting
his
letter
you
had
robbed
me
of
the
only
friend
i
had
in
england
at
the
very
moment
when
he
needed
me
and
i
was
on
my
way
to
him
i
could
have
saved
his
ship
and
you
had
sent
both
him
and
it
to
the
bottom
that
i
say
candidly
was
what
i
thought
i
do
blame
you
for
thinking
it
before
the
trial
said
rachel
it
seems
to
have
been
the
universal
opinion
i
formed
mine
for
myself
and
i
had
a
particular
reason
for
forming
it
continued
steel
with
a
marked
vibration
in
his
usually
unemotional
voice
i
do
know
which
to
tell
you
first
well
it
shall
be
that
reason
on
the
night
of
the
murder
do
you
remember
coming
downstairs
and
going
or
rather
looking
into
the
study
at
one
in
the
morning
rachel
recoiled
in
her
chair
heavens
she
cried
how
can
you
know
that
did
you
hear
nothing
as
you
went
upstairs
again
i
do
remember
not
a
rattle
at
the
yes
yes
now
i
do
remember
and
it
was
actually
you
it
was
indeed
said
steel
gravely
i
saw
you
come
down
i
saw
you
peep
in
all
dread
and
reluctance
i
saw
you
recoil
i
saw
the
face
with
which
you
shut
those
doors
and
put
out
the
lights
and
afterwards
i
learned
from
the
medical
evidence
that
your
husband
must
have
been
dead
at
that
time
one
thing
i
knew
and
that
was
that
he
was
not
shot
during
the
next
hour
and
more
for
i
waited
about
until
two
in
the
hope
that
he
would
come
out
i
was
not
going
to
ring
and
bring
you
down
again
for
i
had
seen
your
face
and
i
still
saw
your
light
upstairs
so
you
thought
i
had
come
down
to
see
my
handiwork
to
see
if
he
was
really
dead
yes
i
thought
that
afterwards
i
could
not
help
thinking
it
rachel
did
it
never
occur
to
you
that
i
might
have
thought
he
was
asleep
yes
that
has
struck
me
since
you
have
not
thought
me
guilty
all
along
then
not
all
along
did
you
right
through
my
trial
god
forgive
me
yes
i
did
and
there
was
one
thing
that
convinced
me
more
than
anything
else
that
was
when
you
told
the
jury
that
the
occasion
of
your
final
parting
upstairs
was
the
last
time
you
saw
poor
alec
alive
but
it
was
said
rachel
i
remember
the
question
i
did
not
know
how
to
answer
it
i
could
not
tell
them
i
had
seen
him
dead
but
fancied
him
only
asleep
that
they
would
never
have
believed
so
i
told
the
simple
truth
but
it
upset
me
dreadfully
that
i
saw
you
expected
yes
and
i
did
not
know
whether
to
stick
to
the
truth
or
to
lie
i
can
read
people
sometimes
steel
continued
after
a
pause
i
guessed
your
difficulty
surely
you
must
see
the
only
conceivable
inference
i
did
see
it
and
seeing
do
you
not
forgive
yes
that
but
you
married
me
while
you
still
thought
me
guilty
i
forgive
you
for
denying
it
at
the
time
i
suppose
that
was
necessary
but
you
have
not
yet
told
me
why
you
did
it
honestly
rachel
it
was
largely
fascination
but
not
primarily
no
then
let
me
hear
the
prime
motive
at
last
for
i
am
tired
of
trying
to
guess
it
steel
stood
before
his
wife
as
he
had
never
stood
before
her
yet
his
white
head
bowed
his
dark
eyes
lowered
hands
clasped
shoulders
bent
the
suppliant
and
the
penitent
in
one
i
did
it
to
punish
you
he
said
i
thought
some
one
must
i
felt
i
could
have
hanged
you
if
i
had
spoken
out
what
i
had
seen
and
i
married
you
instead
his
eyes
were
on
the
ground
when
he
raised
them
she
was
smiling
through
unshed
tears
but
she
had
spoken
first
it
was
not
a
very
terrible
motive
after
all
she
had
said
at
least
it
has
not
been
such
a
very
terrible
punishment
no
but
that
was
because
i
did
the
very
last
thing
i
ever
thought
of
doing
and
that
was
to
fall
in
love
with
you
at
the
beginning
rachel
gave
a
little
start
although
you
thought
me
guilty
that
made
no
difference
at
all
but
i
have
thought
it
less
and
less
until
on
the
night
you
appealed
first
to
me
and
then
to
langholm
on
thinking
over
that
night
it
was
impossible
to
suppose
it
any
more
rachel
rose
her
cheeks
divinely
red
her
lip
trembling
her
hand
outstretched
and
you
fell
in
love
with
me
she
murmured
god
knows
i
did
rachel
in
my
own
way
said
steel
i
am
so
glad
whispered
his
wife
the
end
