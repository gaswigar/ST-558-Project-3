i
assheton
house
in
sussex
square
brighton
was
appointed
with
that
finish
of
smooth
stateliness
which
robs
stateliness
of
its
formality
and
conceals
the
amount
of
trouble
and
personal
attention
which
has
originally
in
any
case
been
spent
on
the
production
of
the
smoothness
everything
moved
with
the
regularity
of
the
solar
system
and
superior
to
that
wild
rush
of
heavy
bodies
through
infinite
ether
there
was
never
the
slightest
fear
of
comets
streaking
their
unconjectured
way
across
the
sky
or
meteorites
falling
on
unsuspicious
picnicers
in
house
supreme
over
climatic
conditions
nobody
ever
felt
that
rooms
were
either
too
hot
or
too
cold
a
pleasantly
fresh
yet
comfortably
warm
atmosphere
pervaded
the
place
meals
were
always
punctual
and
her
admirable
scotch
cook
never
served
up
a
dish
which
whether
plain
or
ornate
was
not
in
its
way
perfectly
prepared
a
couple
of
deft
and
noiseless
attended
to
and
anticipated
the
wants
of
her
guests
from
the
moment
they
entered
her
hospitable
doors
till
when
on
their
leaving
them
their
coats
were
held
for
them
in
the
most
convenient
possible
manner
for
the
easy
insertion
of
the
human
arm
and
the
tails
of
their
cunningly
and
unerringly
tweaked
from
behind
in
every
way
in
fact
the
house
was
an
example
of
perfect
comfort
the
softest
carpets
overlaid
the
floors
or
where
the
polished
wood
was
left
bare
the
parquetry
shone
with
a
moonlike
radiance
the
newest
and
most
entertaining
books
ready
cut
stood
on
the
shelves
in
the
to
beguile
the
leisure
of
the
studiously
minded
the
billiard
table
was
always
speckless
of
dust
no
tip
was
ever
missing
from
any
cue
and
the
cigarette
boxes
and
were
always
kept
replenished
in
the
the
silver
was
resplendent
until
the
moment
when
before
dessert
the
cloth
was
withdrawn
and
showed
a
rosewood
table
that
might
have
served
for
a
mirror
to
narcissus
assheton
until
her
only
surviving
son
morris
had
come
to
live
with
her
some
three
months
ago
on
the
completion
of
his
four
years
at
cambridge
had
been
alone
but
even
when
she
was
alone
this
ceremony
of
drawing
the
cloth
and
putting
on
the
dessert
and
wine
had
never
been
omitted
though
since
she
never
took
either
it
might
seem
to
be
a
wasted
piece
of
routine
on
the
part
of
the
two
noiseless
parlourmaids
but
she
did
not
in
the
least
consider
it
so
for
just
as
she
always
dressed
for
dinner
herself
with
the
same
care
and
finish
whether
she
was
going
to
dine
alone
or
whether
as
tonight
a
guest
or
two
was
dining
with
her
as
an
offering
so
to
speak
on
the
altar
of
her
own
so
also
she
required
and
the
formality
that
indicated
it
on
the
part
of
those
who
ministered
at
her
table
and
enjoyed
such
excellent
wages
this
pretty
custom
had
always
been
the
rule
in
her
own
home
and
her
husband
had
always
had
it
practised
during
his
life
and
since
then
his
death
had
occurred
some
twenty
years
ago
nothing
that
she
knew
of
had
happened
to
make
it
less
proper
or
desirable
kind
of
heart
and
warm
of
soul
though
she
was
she
saw
no
reason
for
letting
these
excellent
qualities
cover
any
slackness
or
breach
of
observance
in
the
social
form
of
life
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
there
was
no
cause
because
one
was
kind
and
wise
to
eat
with
badly
cleaned
silver
unless
the
whose
office
it
was
to
clean
it
was
unwell
in
such
a
case
if
the
extra
work
entailed
by
her
illness
would
throw
too
much
on
the
shoulders
of
the
other
servants
assheton
would
willingly
clean
the
silver
herself
rather
than
that
it
should
appear
dull
and
tarnished
her
formalism
such
as
it
was
was
perfectly
simple
and
sincere
she
would
without
any
very
poignant
regret
or
sense
of
martyrdom
had
her
very
comfortable
income
been
cut
down
to
a
tenth
of
what
it
was
have
gone
to
live
in
a
cottage
with
one
servant
but
she
would
have
left
that
cottage
at
once
for
even
humbler
surroundings
had
she
found
that
her
straitened
circumstances
did
not
permit
her
to
keep
it
as
speckless
and
as
was
her
present
house
in
sussex
square
this
achievement
of
having
lived
for
nearly
sixty
years
so
decorously
may
perhaps
be
a
somewhat
finer
performance
than
it
sounds
but
assheton
brought
as
her
contribution
to
life
in
general
a
far
finer
offering
than
that
for
though
she
did
not
propose
to
change
her
ways
and
manner
of
life
herself
she
was
notoriously
sympathetic
with
the
changed
life
of
the
younger
generation
and
in
consequence
had
the
confidence
of
young
folk
generally
at
this
moment
she
was
enjoying
the
fruits
of
her
liberal
attitude
in
the
volubility
of
her
son
morris
who
sat
at
the
end
of
the
table
opposite
to
her
his
volubility
was
at
present
concerned
with
his
in
which
he
had
arrived
that
afternoon
darling
mother
he
was
saying
i
really
was
frightened
as
to
whether
you
would
mind
i
could
help
remembering
how
you
received
taynton
proposal
that
you
should
go
for
a
drive
in
his
car
do
you
remember
taynton
mother
nose
go
in
the
air
it
no
use
denying
it
so
i
thought
perhaps
that
she
would
like
my
having
one
but
i
wanted
it
so
dreadfully
and
so
i
bought
it
without
telling
her
and
drove
down
in
it
which
is
my
birthday
so
that
she
be
too
severe
taynton
while
morris
was
speaking
had
picked
up
the
nutcrackers
the
boy
had
been
using
and
was
gravely
exploding
the
shells
of
the
nuts
he
had
helped
himself
to
so
morris
cracked
the
next
one
with
a
loud
bang
between
his
white
even
teeth
dear
morris
said
his
mother
how
foolish
of
you
give
morris
another
nutcracker
she
added
to
the
what
foolish
asked
he
cracking
another
oh
morris
your
teeth
she
said
do
wait
a
moment
yes
that
right
and
how
can
you
say
that
my
nose
went
in
the
air
i
sure
taynton
will
agree
with
me
that
that
is
really
libellous
and
as
for
your
being
afraid
to
tell
me
you
had
bought
a
yourself
why
that
is
sillier
than
cracking
nuts
with
your
teeth
taynton
laughed
a
comfortable
laugh
do
put
the
responsibility
on
me
assheton
he
said
as
long
as
morris
bank
does
tell
us
that
his
account
is
overdrawn
he
can
do
what
he
pleases
but
if
we
are
told
that
then
down
comes
the
cartloads
of
bricks
oh
you
are
a
brick
all
right
taynton
said
the
boy
i
could
stand
a
cartload
of
you
taynton
like
his
laugh
was
comfortable
and
solicitors
are
supposed
to
be
and
but
his
face
was
and
comely
and
his
rather
bald
head
beamed
with
benevolence
and
dinner
my
dear
boy
he
said
and
it
is
your
birthday
i
can
not
honour
either
you
or
this
wonderful
port
more
properly
than
by
drinking
your
health
in
it
he
began
and
finished
his
glass
to
the
health
he
had
so
neatly
proposed
and
morris
laughed
thank
you
very
much
he
said
mother
do
send
the
port
round
what
an
inhospitable
woman
assheton
rose
i
will
leave
you
to
be
more
hospitable
than
me
then
dear
she
said
shall
we
go
madge
indeed
i
am
afraid
you
must
if
you
are
to
catch
the
train
to
falmer
madge
templeton
got
up
with
her
hostess
and
the
two
men
rose
too
she
had
been
sitting
next
morris
and
the
boy
looked
at
her
eagerly
it
too
bad
your
having
to
go
he
said
but
do
you
think
i
may
come
over
in
the
afternoon
some
time
and
see
you
and
lady
templeton
madge
paused
a
moment
i
am
so
sorry
she
said
but
we
shall
be
away
all
day
we
sha
be
back
till
quite
late
oh
what
a
bore
said
he
and
i
leave
again
on
friday
do
let
me
come
and
see
you
off
then
but
assheton
interposed
no
dear
she
said
i
am
going
to
have
five
minutes
talk
with
madge
before
she
goes
and
we
do
want
you
look
after
taynton
i
know
he
wants
to
talk
to
you
and
i
want
to
talk
to
madge
taynton
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
the
ladies
sat
down
again
with
a
rather
obvious
air
of
proposing
to
enjoy
himself
it
was
quite
true
that
he
had
a
few
pleasant
things
to
say
to
morris
it
is
also
true
that
he
immensely
appreciated
the
wonderful
port
which
glowed
in
the
nearly
full
decanter
that
lay
to
his
hand
and
above
all
he
with
his
busy
life
occupied
for
the
most
part
in
innumerable
small
affairs
revelled
in
the
sense
of
leisure
and
serene
smoothness
which
permeated
assheton
house
he
was
still
a
year
or
two
short
of
sixty
and
but
for
his
very
bald
and
shining
head
would
have
seemed
younger
so
fresh
was
he
in
complexion
so
active
despite
a
certain
reassuring
corpulency
was
he
in
his
movements
but
when
he
dined
quietly
like
this
at
assheton
he
would
willingly
have
sacrificed
the
next
five
years
of
his
life
if
he
could
have
been
assured
on
really
reliable
authority
the
authority
for
instance
of
the
recording
angel
that
in
five
years
time
he
would
be
able
to
sit
quiet
and
not
work
any
more
he
wanted
very
much
to
be
able
to
take
a
passive
instead
of
an
active
interest
in
life
and
this
a
few
hundreds
of
pounds
a
year
in
addition
to
his
savings
would
enable
him
to
do
he
saw
in
fact
the
goal
arrived
at
which
he
would
be
able
to
sit
still
and
wait
with
serenity
and
calmness
for
the
event
which
would
certainly
relieve
him
of
all
further
material
anxieties
his
very
active
life
the
activities
of
which
were
so
largely
benevolent
had
at
the
expiration
of
years
a
little
tired
him
he
coveted
the
leisure
which
was
so
nearly
his
morris
lit
a
cigarette
for
himself
having
previously
passed
the
wine
to
taynton
i
hate
port
he
said
but
my
mother
tells
me
this
is
all
right
it
was
laid
down
the
year
i
was
born
by
the
way
you
do
mind
my
smoking
do
you
this
to
tell
the
truth
seemed
almost
sacrilegious
to
taynton
for
the
idea
that
tobacco
especially
the
frivolous
cigarette
should
burn
in
a
room
where
such
port
was
being
drunk
was
sheer
crime
against
human
and
divine
laws
but
he
could
scarcely
indicate
to
his
host
that
he
should
not
smoke
in
his
own
no
my
dear
morris
he
said
but
really
you
almost
shock
me
when
you
prefer
tobacco
to
this
nectar
i
assure
you
nectar
and
the
car
now
tell
me
more
about
the
car
morris
laughed
i
so
deeply
thankful
i
have
overdrawn
he
said
oh
the
car
a
clipper
we
came
down
from
haywards
heath
the
most
gorgeous
pace
i
saw
one
policeman
trying
to
take
my
number
but
we
raised
such
a
dust
i
do
think
he
can
have
been
able
to
see
it
it
such
rot
only
going
twenty
miles
an
hour
with
a
clear
straight
road
ahead
taynton
sighed
gently
and
not
unhappily
yes
yes
my
dear
boy
i
so
sympathise
with
you
he
said
speed
and
violence
is
the
proper
attitude
of
youth
just
as
strength
with
a
more
measured
pace
is
the
proper
gait
for
older
folk
and
that
i
fancy
is
just
what
assheton
felt
she
would
feel
it
to
be
as
unnatural
in
you
to
care
to
drive
with
her
in
her
very
comfortable
victoria
as
she
would
feel
it
to
be
unnatural
in
herself
to
wish
to
go
in
your
lightning
speed
motor
and
that
reminds
me
as
your
trustee
coffee
was
brought
in
at
this
moment
carried
not
by
one
of
the
discreet
but
by
a
young
taynton
with
the
port
still
by
him
refused
it
but
looked
rather
curiously
at
the
servant
morris
however
mixed
himself
a
cup
in
which
cream
sugar
and
coffee
were
about
equally
mingled
a
new
servant
of
your
mother
he
asked
when
the
man
had
left
the
room
oh
no
it
my
man
martin
awfully
handy
chap
cleans
silver
boots
and
the
motor
drives
it
too
when
i
let
him
which
is
very
often
chauffeurs
are
such
rotters
are
they
regular
chauffeurs
i
mean
they
always
make
out
that
something
is
wrong
with
the
car
just
as
dentists
always
find
some
hole
in
your
teeth
if
you
go
to
them
taynton
did
not
reply
to
these
critical
generalities
but
went
back
to
what
he
had
been
saying
when
the
entry
of
coffee
interrupted
him
as
your
mother
said
he
remarked
i
wanted
to
have
a
few
words
with
you
you
are
are
you
not
well
when
i
was
young
we
considered
anyone
of
a
boy
still
but
now
i
think
young
fellows
grow
up
more
quickly
and
at
you
are
a
man
nowadays
and
i
think
it
is
time
for
you
since
my
trusteeship
for
you
may
end
any
day
now
to
take
a
rather
more
active
interest
in
the
state
of
your
finances
than
you
have
hitherto
done
i
want
you
in
fact
my
dear
fellow
to
listen
to
me
for
five
minutes
while
i
state
your
position
to
you
morris
indicated
the
port
again
and
taynton
refilled
his
glass
i
have
had
twenty
years
of
stewardship
for
you
he
went
on
and
before
my
stewardship
comes
to
an
end
which
it
will
do
anyhow
in
three
years
from
now
and
may
come
to
an
end
any
day
why
how
is
that
asked
morris
if
you
marry
my
dear
boy
by
the
terms
of
your
father
will
your
marriage
provided
it
takes
place
with
your
mother
consent
and
after
your
birthday
puts
you
in
complete
control
and
possession
of
your
fortune
otherwise
as
of
course
you
know
you
come
of
age
legally
speaking
on
your
birthday
morris
lit
another
cigarette
rather
impatiently
yes
i
knew
i
was
a
minor
till
i
was
he
said
and
i
suppose
i
have
known
that
if
i
married
after
the
age
of
i
became
a
major
or
whatever
you
call
it
but
what
then
do
let
us
go
and
play
billiards
i
give
you
in
a
hundred
because
been
playing
a
lot
lately
and
i
bet
half
a
crown
taynton
fist
gently
tapped
the
table
done
he
said
and
we
will
play
in
five
minutes
but
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
first
your
mother
as
you
know
enjoys
the
income
of
the
bulk
of
your
father
property
for
her
lifetime
outside
that
he
left
this
much
smaller
capital
of
which
as
also
of
her
money
my
partner
and
i
are
trustees
the
sum
he
left
you
was
thirty
thousand
pounds
it
is
now
rather
over
forty
thousand
pounds
since
we
have
changed
the
investments
from
time
to
time
and
always
i
am
glad
to
say
with
satisfactory
results
the
value
of
her
property
has
gone
up
also
in
a
corresponding
degree
that
however
does
not
concern
you
but
since
you
are
now
and
your
marriage
would
put
the
whole
of
this
smaller
sum
into
your
hands
would
it
not
be
well
for
you
to
look
through
our
books
to
see
for
yourself
the
account
we
render
of
our
stewardship
morris
laughed
but
for
what
reason
he
asked
you
tell
me
that
my
portion
has
increased
in
value
by
ten
thousand
pounds
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
and
i
thank
you
very
much
and
as
for
he
broke
off
short
and
taynton
let
a
perceptible
pause
follow
before
he
interrupted
as
for
the
possibility
of
your
marrying
he
suggested
morris
gave
him
a
quick
eager
glance
yes
i
think
there
is
that
possibility
he
said
i
hope
i
hope
it
is
not
far
distant
my
dear
boy
said
the
lawyer
ah
not
a
word
i
do
know
morris
pushed
his
chair
back
quickly
and
stood
up
his
tall
slim
figure
outlined
against
the
sober
red
of
the
wall
a
plume
of
black
hair
had
escaped
from
his
head
and
hung
over
his
forehead
and
his
vivid
face
looked
extraordinarily
handsome
his
mother
energetic
features
were
there
with
the
glow
and
buoyancy
of
youth
kindling
them
violent
vitality
was
his
also
his
was
the
hot
blood
that
could
do
any
deed
when
the
commanded
it
he
looked
like
one
of
those
who
could
give
their
body
to
be
burned
in
the
pursuit
of
an
idea
or
could
as
easily
steal
or
kill
provided
only
the
deed
was
vitally
done
in
the
heat
of
his
blood
violence
was
clearly
his
mode
of
life
the
motor
had
to
go
sixty
miles
an
hour
he
might
be
one
of
those
who
bathed
in
the
serpentine
in
he
would
clearly
dance
all
night
and
ride
all
day
and
go
on
till
he
dropped
in
the
pursuit
of
what
he
cared
for
taynton
looking
at
him
as
he
stood
smiling
there
in
his
splendid
health
and
vigour
felt
all
this
he
felt
too
that
if
morris
intended
to
be
married
morning
matrimony
would
probably
take
place
but
morris
pause
after
he
pushed
his
chair
back
and
stood
up
was
only
momentary
good
god
yes
i
in
love
he
said
and
she
probably
thinks
me
a
stupid
barbarian
who
likes
only
to
drive
golfballs
and
motorcars
she
oh
it
hopeless
she
would
have
let
me
come
over
to
see
them
otherwise
he
paused
again
and
now
i
given
the
whole
show
away
he
said
taynton
made
a
comfortable
sort
of
noise
it
was
compounded
of
laughter
sympathy
and
comprehension
you
gave
it
away
long
ago
my
dear
morris
he
said
you
had
guessed
asked
morris
sitting
down
again
with
the
same
quickness
and
violence
of
movement
and
putting
both
his
elbows
on
the
table
no
my
dear
boy
you
had
told
me
as
you
have
told
everybody
without
mentioning
it
and
i
most
heartily
congratulate
you
i
never
saw
a
more
delightful
girl
professionally
also
i
feel
bound
to
add
that
it
seems
to
me
a
most
proper
alliance
heirs
should
always
marry
heiresses
it
taynton
drank
off
the
rest
of
his
port
it
keeps
properties
together
hot
blood
again
dictated
to
morris
it
seemed
dreadful
to
him
that
any
thought
of
money
or
of
property
could
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
as
that
which
he
longed
for
he
rose
again
as
abruptly
and
violently
as
he
had
sat
down
well
let
play
billiards
he
said
i
i
do
think
you
understand
a
bit
you
ca
in
fact
taynton
stroked
the
tablecloth
for
a
moment
with
a
plump
white
forefinger
crabbed
age
and
youth
he
remarked
but
crabbed
age
makes
an
appeal
to
youth
if
youth
will
kindly
call
to
mind
what
crabbed
age
referred
to
some
five
minutes
ago
in
other
words
will
you
or
will
you
not
morris
spend
a
very
dry
three
hours
at
my
office
looking
into
the
account
of
my
stewardship
there
was
thirty
thousand
pounds
and
there
now
is
or
should
we
say
forty
it
will
take
you
not
less
than
two
hours
and
not
more
than
three
but
since
my
stewardship
may
come
to
an
end
as
i
said
any
day
i
should
not
for
my
own
sake
but
for
yours
wish
you
to
see
what
we
have
done
for
you
and
i
own
this
would
be
a
certain
private
gratification
to
me
to
learn
that
you
thought
that
the
trust
your
dear
father
reposed
in
us
was
not
misplaced
there
was
something
about
these
simple
words
which
touched
morris
for
the
moment
he
became
almost
businesslike
taynton
had
been
as
he
knew
a
friend
of
his
father
and
as
he
had
said
he
had
been
steward
of
his
own
affairs
for
twenty
years
but
that
reflection
banished
the
businesslike
view
oh
but
two
hours
is
a
fearful
time
he
said
you
have
told
me
the
facts
and
they
entirely
satisfy
me
and
i
want
to
be
out
all
day
as
i
am
only
here
till
the
day
after
but
i
shall
be
down
again
next
week
let
us
go
into
it
all
then
not
that
there
is
the
slightest
use
in
going
into
anything
and
when
taynton
i
become
steward
of
my
own
affairs
you
may
be
quite
certain
that
i
shall
beg
you
to
continue
looking
after
them
why
you
gained
me
ten
thousand
pounds
in
these
twenty
years
i
wonder
what
there
would
have
been
to
my
credit
now
if
i
had
looked
after
things
myself
but
since
we
are
on
the
subject
i
should
like
just
this
once
to
assure
you
of
my
great
gratitude
to
you
for
all
you
have
done
and
i
ask
you
if
you
will
to
look
after
my
affairs
in
the
future
with
the
same
completeness
as
you
have
always
done
my
father
will
does
not
prevent
that
does
it
taynton
looked
at
the
young
fellow
with
affection
dear
morris
he
said
gaily
we
lawyers
and
solicitors
are
always
supposed
to
be
sharks
but
personally
i
am
not
such
a
shark
as
that
are
you
aware
that
i
am
paid
a
year
for
my
stewardship
which
you
are
entitled
to
assume
for
yourself
on
your
marriage
though
of
course
its
continuance
in
my
hands
is
not
forbidden
in
your
father
will
you
are
quite
competent
to
look
after
your
affairs
yourself
it
is
ridiculous
for
you
to
continue
to
pay
me
this
sum
but
i
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
for
your
confidence
in
me
a
very
close
observer
might
have
seen
that
behind
taynton
kind
gay
eyes
there
was
sitting
a
personality
so
to
speak
that
as
his
mouth
framed
these
words
was
watching
morris
rather
narrowly
and
anxiously
but
the
moment
morris
spoke
this
silent
secret
watcher
popped
back
again
out
of
sight
well
then
i
ask
you
as
a
personal
favour
said
he
to
continue
being
my
steward
why
it
good
business
for
me
is
it
in
twenty
years
you
make
me
ten
thousand
pounds
and
i
only
pay
you
a
year
for
it
please
be
kind
taynton
and
continue
making
me
rich
oh
i
a
jolly
chap
really
i
know
that
it
is
to
my
advantage
taynton
considered
this
a
moment
playing
with
his
wine
glass
then
he
looked
up
quickly
yes
morris
i
will
with
pleasure
do
as
you
ask
me
he
said
right
oh
thanks
awfully
do
come
and
play
billiards
morris
was
in
amazing
luck
that
night
and
if
as
he
said
he
had
been
playing
a
lot
lately
the
advantage
of
his
practice
was
seen
chiefly
in
the
hideous
certainty
of
his
flukes
and
the
game
though
he
received
left
taynton
half
a
crown
the
poorer
then
the
winner
whirled
his
guest
upstairs
again
to
talk
to
his
mother
while
he
himself
went
round
to
the
stables
to
assure
himself
of
the
of
the
beloved
motor
martin
had
already
valeted
it
after
its
run
and
was
just
locking
up
when
morris
arrived
morris
gave
his
orders
for
next
day
after
a
quite
unnecessary
examination
into
the
internal
economy
of
the
beloved
and
was
just
going
back
to
the
house
when
he
paused
remembering
something
oh
martin
he
said
while
i
am
here
i
want
you
to
help
in
the
house
you
know
at
dinner
and
so
on
just
as
you
did
and
when
there
are
guests
of
mine
here
i
want
you
to
look
after
them
for
instance
when
taynton
goes
tonight
you
will
be
there
to
give
him
his
hat
and
coat
you
have
rather
a
lot
to
do
i
afraid
morris
finished
his
cigarette
and
went
back
to
the
where
taynton
was
already
engaged
in
the
staid
excitements
of
backgammon
with
his
mother
that
game
over
morris
took
his
place
and
before
long
the
lawyer
rose
to
go
now
i
absolutely
refuse
to
let
you
interrupt
your
game
he
said
i
have
found
my
way
out
of
this
house
often
enough
i
should
think
good
night
assheton
good
night
morris
do
break
your
neck
my
dear
boy
in
trying
to
break
records
morris
hardly
attended
to
this
for
the
game
was
critical
he
just
rang
the
bell
said
good
night
and
had
thrown
again
before
the
door
had
closed
behind
taynton
below
in
answer
to
the
bell
was
standing
his
servant
taynton
looked
at
him
again
with
some
attention
and
then
glanced
round
to
see
if
the
discreet
were
about
so
you
are
called
martin
now
he
observed
gently
yes
sir
i
recognised
you
at
once
there
was
a
short
pause
are
you
going
to
tell
morris
sir
he
asked
that
i
had
to
dismiss
you
two
years
ago
for
theft
said
taynton
quietly
no
not
if
you
behave
yourself
taynton
looked
at
him
again
kindly
and
sighed
no
let
bygones
be
bygones
he
said
you
will
find
your
secret
is
safe
enough
and
martin
i
hope
you
have
really
turned
over
a
new
leaf
and
are
living
honestly
now
that
is
so
my
lad
thank
god
thank
god
my
umbrella
thanks
good
night
no
cab
i
will
walk
chapter
ii
taynton
lived
in
a
square
comfortable
house
in
montpellier
road
and
thus
when
he
left
assheton
there
was
some
two
miles
of
pavement
and
sea
front
between
him
and
home
but
the
night
was
of
wonderful
beauty
a
night
of
mid
june
warm
enough
to
make
the
most
cautious
secure
of
chill
and
at
the
same
time
just
made
crisp
with
a
little
breeze
that
blew
or
rather
whispered
landward
from
over
the
of
the
sleeping
sea
high
up
in
the
heavens
swung
a
glorious
moon
which
cast
its
path
of
white
enchanted
light
over
the
ripples
and
seemed
to
draw
the
heart
even
as
it
drew
the
eyes
heavenward
taynton
certainly
as
he
stepped
out
beneath
the
stars
with
the
sea
lying
below
him
felt
in
his
delicate
and
sensitive
nature
the
charm
of
the
hour
and
being
a
good
if
not
a
brisk
walker
he
determined
to
go
home
on
foot
and
he
stepped
westward
very
contentedly
the
evening
it
would
appear
had
much
pleased
him
for
it
was
long
before
his
smile
of
retrospective
pleasure
faded
from
his
pleasant
mobile
face
morris
trust
and
confidence
in
him
had
been
extraordinarily
pleasant
to
him
and
modest
and
unassuming
as
he
was
he
could
not
help
a
secret
gratification
at
the
thought
what
a
handsome
fellow
morris
was
too
how
gay
how
attractive
he
had
his
father
dark
colouring
and
tall
figure
but
much
of
his
mother
grace
and
charm
had
gone
to
the
modelling
of
that
thin
sensitive
mouth
and
the
long
oval
of
his
face
yet
there
was
more
of
the
father
there
the
father
intense
almost
violent
vitality
was
somehow
more
characteristic
of
the
essential
morris
than
face
or
feature
what
a
happy
thing
it
was
too
here
the
smile
of
pleasure
illuminated
taynton
face
again
that
the
boy
whom
he
had
dismissed
two
years
before
for
some
petty
pilfering
in
his
own
house
should
have
turned
out
such
a
promising
lad
and
should
have
found
his
way
to
so
pleasant
a
berth
as
that
of
factotum
to
morris
kindly
and
charitable
all
through
and
ever
eager
to
draw
out
the
good
in
everybody
and
forgive
the
bad
taynton
had
often
occasion
to
deplore
the
hardness
and
uncharity
of
a
world
which
remembers
youthful
errors
and
hangs
them
like
a
round
the
neck
of
the
offender
and
it
warmed
his
heart
and
kindled
his
smile
to
think
of
one
case
at
any
rate
where
a
youthful
misdemeanour
was
lived
down
and
forgotten
at
the
time
he
remembered
being
in
doubt
whether
he
should
not
give
the
offender
up
to
justice
for
the
pilfering
petty
though
it
had
been
had
been
somewhat
persistent
but
he
had
taken
the
more
merciful
course
and
merely
dismissed
the
boy
he
had
been
in
two
minds
about
it
before
wondering
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
let
martin
have
a
sharp
lesson
but
he
was
thankful
that
he
had
not
done
so
the
mercy
he
had
shown
had
come
back
to
bless
him
also
he
felt
a
glow
of
thankfulness
that
the
subject
of
his
clemency
had
turned
out
so
well
punishment
often
hardens
the
criminal
was
one
of
his
settled
convictions
but
morris
again
his
thoughts
went
back
to
morris
who
was
already
standing
on
the
verge
of
manhood
on
the
verge
too
he
made
no
doubt
of
married
life
and
its
joys
and
responsibilities
taynton
was
himself
a
bachelor
and
the
thought
gave
him
not
a
moment
of
jealousy
but
a
moment
of
void
that
ached
a
little
at
the
thought
of
the
common
human
bliss
which
he
had
himself
missed
how
charming
too
was
the
girl
madge
templeton
whom
he
had
met
not
for
the
first
time
that
evening
he
himself
had
guessed
how
things
stood
between
the
two
before
morris
had
confided
in
him
and
it
pleased
him
that
his
intuition
was
confirmed
what
a
pity
however
that
the
two
were
not
going
to
meet
next
day
that
she
was
out
with
her
mother
and
would
not
get
back
till
late
it
would
have
been
a
cooling
thought
in
the
hot
office
hours
of
to
picture
them
sitting
together
in
the
garden
at
falmer
or
under
one
of
the
cool
oaks
in
the
park
then
suddenly
his
face
changed
the
smile
faded
but
came
back
next
instant
and
broadened
with
a
laugh
and
the
man
who
laughs
when
he
is
by
himself
may
certainly
be
supposed
to
have
strong
cause
for
amusement
taynton
had
come
by
this
time
to
the
west
pier
and
a
hundred
yards
farther
would
bring
him
to
montpellier
road
but
it
was
yet
early
as
he
saw
so
bright
was
the
moonlight
when
he
consulted
his
watch
and
he
retraced
his
steps
some
fifty
yards
and
eventually
rang
at
the
door
of
a
big
house
of
flats
facing
the
sea
where
his
partner
who
for
the
most
part
looked
after
the
london
branch
of
their
business
had
his
for
the
firm
of
taynton
and
mills
was
one
of
those
respectable
and
solid
businesses
that
beginning
in
the
country
had
eventually
been
extended
to
town
and
so
far
from
its
having
its
headquarters
in
town
and
its
branch
in
brighton
had
its
headquarters
here
and
its
branch
in
the
metropolis
godfrey
mills
so
he
learned
at
the
door
had
dined
alone
and
was
in
and
without
further
delay
taynton
was
carried
aloft
in
the
gaudy
of
the
lift
feeling
sure
that
his
partner
would
see
him
the
flat
into
which
he
was
ushered
with
a
smile
of
welcome
from
the
man
who
opened
the
door
was
furnished
with
a
sort
of
gross
opulence
that
never
failed
to
jar
on
taynton
exquisite
taste
and
cultivated
mind
pictures
chairs
sofas
the
patterns
of
the
carpet
and
the
heavy
gilding
of
the
cornices
were
all
sensuous
a
sort
of
frangipanni
to
the
eye
the
apparent
contrast
however
between
these
things
and
their
owner
was
as
great
as
that
between
taynton
and
his
partner
for
godfrey
mills
was
a
thin
spare
dark
little
man
brisk
in
movement
with
a
look
in
his
eye
that
betokened
a
watchfulness
and
vigilance
of
the
most
alert
order
but
useful
as
such
a
gift
undoubtedly
is
it
was
given
to
godfrey
mills
perhaps
a
shade
too
obviously
it
would
be
unlikely
that
the
stupidest
or
shallowest
person
would
give
himself
away
when
talking
to
him
for
it
was
so
clear
that
he
was
always
on
the
watch
for
admission
or
information
that
might
be
useful
to
him
he
had
however
the
charm
that
a
very
active
and
vivid
mind
always
possesses
and
though
small
and
slight
he
was
a
figure
that
would
be
noticed
anywhere
so
keen
and
was
his
face
beside
him
taynton
looked
like
a
benevolent
country
clergyman
more
distinguished
for
amiable
qualities
of
the
heart
than
intellectual
qualities
of
the
head
yet
those
there
were
not
many
of
them
who
in
dealings
with
the
latter
had
tried
to
conduct
their
business
on
these
assumptions
had
invariably
found
it
necessary
to
reconsider
their
first
impression
of
him
his
partner
however
was
always
conscious
of
a
little
impatience
in
talking
to
him
taynton
he
would
have
allowed
did
not
lack
fine
business
qualities
but
he
was
a
little
wanting
in
quickness
mills
welcome
of
him
was
abrupt
pleased
to
see
you
he
said
cigar
drink
sit
down
wo
you
what
is
it
i
dropped
in
for
a
chat
on
my
way
home
said
taynton
i
have
been
dining
with
assheton
a
most
pleasant
evening
what
a
fine
delicate
face
she
has
mills
bit
off
the
end
of
a
cigar
i
take
it
that
you
did
not
come
in
merely
to
discuss
the
delicacy
of
assheton
face
he
said
no
no
dear
fellow
you
are
right
to
recall
me
i
too
take
it
i
take
it
that
you
have
found
time
to
go
over
to
falmer
yesterday
how
did
you
find
sir
richard
i
found
him
well
i
had
a
long
talk
with
him
and
you
managed
to
convey
something
of
those
very
painful
facts
which
you
felt
it
was
your
duty
to
bring
to
his
notice
asked
taynton
godfrey
mills
laughed
i
say
taynton
is
it
really
worth
while
keeping
it
up
like
this
he
asked
it
really
saves
so
much
trouble
to
talk
straight
as
i
propose
to
do
i
saw
him
as
i
said
and
i
really
managed
remarkably
well
i
had
these
admissions
wrung
from
me
i
assure
you
it
is
no
less
than
that
under
promise
of
the
most
absolute
secrecy
i
told
him
young
assheton
was
leading
an
idle
extravagant
and
dissipated
life
i
said
i
had
seen
him
three
nights
ago
in
piccadilly
not
quite
sober
in
company
with
the
class
of
person
to
whom
one
does
not
refer
in
polite
society
will
that
do
ah
i
can
easily
imagine
how
painful
you
must
have
found
began
taynton
but
his
partner
interrupted
it
was
rather
painful
you
have
spoken
a
true
word
in
jest
i
felt
a
brute
i
tell
you
but
as
i
pointed
out
to
you
something
of
the
sort
was
necessary
taynton
suddenly
dropped
his
slightly
clerical
manner
you
have
done
excellently
my
dear
friend
he
said
and
as
you
pointed
out
to
me
it
was
indeed
necessary
to
do
something
of
the
sort
i
think
by
now
your
revelations
have
already
begun
to
take
effect
yes
i
think
i
will
take
a
little
brandy
and
soda
thank
you
very
much
he
got
up
with
greater
briskness
than
he
had
hitherto
shown
and
you
are
none
too
soon
he
said
morris
poor
morris
such
a
handsome
fellow
confided
to
me
this
evening
that
he
was
in
love
with
miss
templeton
he
is
very
much
in
earnest
and
why
do
you
think
my
interview
has
met
with
some
success
asked
mills
well
it
is
only
a
conjecture
but
when
morris
asked
if
he
might
call
any
time
miss
templeton
who
was
also
dining
with
assheton
said
that
she
and
her
mother
would
be
out
all
day
and
not
get
home
till
late
it
does
not
strike
me
as
being
too
fanciful
to
see
in
that
some
little
trace
perhaps
of
your
handiwork
yes
that
looks
like
me
said
mills
shortly
taynton
took
a
meditative
sip
at
his
brandy
and
soda
my
evening
also
has
not
been
altogether
wasted
he
said
i
played
what
for
me
was
a
bold
stroke
for
as
you
know
my
dear
fellow
i
prefer
to
leave
to
your
nimble
and
penetrating
mind
things
that
want
dash
and
boldness
but
yes
i
was
warmed
with
that
wonderful
port
and
was
bold
what
did
you
do
asked
mills
well
i
asked
i
almost
implored
dear
morris
to
give
me
two
or
three
hours
and
go
through
all
the
books
and
satisfy
himself
everything
is
in
order
and
his
investments
well
looked
after
i
told
him
also
that
the
original
of
his
had
owing
to
judicious
management
become
you
see
that
is
unfortunately
a
thing
past
praying
for
it
is
so
indubitably
clear
from
the
earlier
ledgers
but
the
port
must
indeed
have
warmed
you
said
mills
quickly
why
it
was
madness
what
if
he
had
consented
taynton
smiled
ah
well
i
in
my
slow
synthetic
manner
had
made
up
my
mind
that
it
was
really
quite
impossible
that
he
should
consent
to
go
into
the
books
and
vouchers
to
begin
with
he
has
a
new
motor
car
and
every
hour
spent
away
from
that
car
just
now
is
to
his
mind
an
hour
wasted
also
i
know
him
well
i
knew
that
he
would
never
consent
to
spend
several
hours
over
ledgers
finally
even
if
he
had
though
i
knew
from
what
i
know
of
him
not
that
he
would
not
but
that
he
not
i
could
have
i
could
have
managed
something
you
see
he
knows
nothing
whatever
about
business
or
investments
mills
shook
his
head
but
it
was
dangerous
anyhow
he
said
and
i
do
understand
what
object
could
be
served
by
it
it
was
running
a
risk
with
no
profit
in
view
then
for
the
first
time
the
inherent
strength
of
the
quietness
of
the
one
man
as
opposed
to
the
obvious
quickness
and
comprehension
of
the
other
came
into
play
i
think
that
i
disagree
with
you
there
my
dear
fellow
said
taynton
slowly
though
when
i
have
told
you
all
i
shall
be
of
course
as
always
delighted
to
recognise
the
superiority
of
your
judgment
should
you
disagree
with
me
and
convince
me
of
the
correctness
of
your
view
it
has
happened
i
know
a
hundred
times
before
that
you
with
your
quick
intuitive
perceptions
have
been
right
but
his
partner
interrupted
him
he
quite
agreed
with
the
sentiment
but
he
wanted
to
learn
without
even
the
delay
caused
by
these
complimentary
remarks
the
upshot
of
taynton
rash
proposal
to
morris
what
did
young
assheton
say
he
asked
well
my
dear
fellow
said
taynton
though
i
have
really
no
doubt
that
in
principle
i
did
a
rash
thing
in
actual
practice
my
step
was
justified
because
morris
absolutely
refused
to
look
at
the
books
of
course
i
know
the
young
fellow
well
it
argues
no
perspicuity
on
my
part
to
have
foreseen
that
and
i
am
glad
to
say
something
in
my
way
of
putting
it
some
sincerity
of
manner
i
suppose
gave
rise
to
a
fresh
mark
of
confidence
in
us
on
his
part
taynton
cleared
his
throat
his
quietness
and
complete
absence
of
hurry
was
so
to
speak
rapidly
overhauling
the
quick
nimble
mind
of
the
other
he
asked
me
in
fact
to
continue
being
steward
of
his
affairs
in
any
event
should
he
marry
i
feel
no
doubt
that
he
would
not
spend
a
couple
of
minutes
over
his
financial
affairs
unless
as
you
foresaw
might
happen
he
had
need
of
a
large
lump
sum
in
that
case
my
dear
mills
you
and
i
would
would
find
it
impossible
to
live
elsewhere
than
in
the
argentine
republic
were
we
so
fortunate
as
to
get
there
but
as
far
as
this
goes
i
only
say
that
the
step
of
mine
which
you
felt
to
be
dangerous
has
turned
out
most
auspiciously
he
begged
me
in
fact
to
continue
even
after
he
came
of
age
acting
for
him
at
my
present
rate
of
remuneration
mills
was
listening
to
this
with
some
attention
here
he
laughed
dryly
that
is
capital
then
he
said
you
were
right
and
i
was
wrong
god
taynton
it
your
manner
you
know
there
something
of
the
country
parson
about
you
that
is
wonderfully
convincing
you
seem
sincere
without
being
sanctimonious
why
if
i
was
to
ask
young
assheton
to
look
into
his
affairs
for
himself
he
would
instantly
think
there
was
something
wrong
and
that
i
was
trying
bluff
but
when
you
do
the
same
thing
that
simple
and
perfectly
correct
explanation
never
occurs
to
him
no
dear
morris
trusts
me
very
completely
said
taynton
but
then
if
i
may
continue
my
little
review
of
the
situation
as
it
now
stands
you
and
your
talk
with
sir
richard
have
vastly
decreased
the
danger
of
his
marrying
for
to
be
frank
i
should
not
feel
at
all
secure
if
that
happened
miss
templeton
is
an
heiress
herself
and
morris
might
easily
take
it
into
his
head
to
spend
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
pounds
in
building
a
house
or
buying
an
estate
and
though
i
think
i
have
guarded
against
his
requiring
an
account
of
our
stewardship
i
ca
prevent
his
wishing
to
draw
a
large
sum
of
money
but
your
brilliant
manoeuvre
may
we
hope
effectually
put
a
stop
to
the
danger
of
his
marrying
miss
templeton
and
since
i
am
convinced
he
is
in
love
with
her
why
taynton
put
his
plump
together
and
raised
his
kind
eyes
to
the
ceiling
why
the
chance
of
his
wanting
to
marry
anybody
else
is
postponed
anyhow
till
till
he
has
got
over
this
unfortunate
attachment
in
fact
my
dear
fellow
there
is
no
longer
anything
immediate
to
fear
and
i
feel
sure
that
before
many
weeks
are
up
the
misfortunes
and
ill
luck
which
for
the
last
two
years
have
dogged
us
with
such
incredible
persistency
will
be
repaired
mills
said
nothing
for
the
moment
but
splashed
himself
out
a
liberal
allowance
of
brandy
into
his
glass
and
mixed
it
with
a
somewhat
more
carefully
measured
ration
of
soda
he
was
essentially
a
sober
man
but
that
was
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
his
head
was
as
impervious
to
alcohol
as
teak
is
to
water
and
it
was
his
habit
to
indulge
in
two
and
those
rather
stiff
brandies
and
sodas
of
an
evening
he
found
that
they
assisted
and
clarified
thought
i
wish
to
heaven
you
had
found
it
necessary
to
let
young
assheton
know
that
his
had
increased
to
he
said
that
more
to
get
back
ah
it
was
just
that
which
gave
him
so
he
thought
such
good
cause
for
reposing
complete
confidence
in
me
remarked
taynton
but
as
you
say
it
is
more
to
get
back
and
i
should
not
have
told
him
were
not
certain
ledgers
of
earlier
years
so
extremely
extremely
unmistakable
on
the
subject
but
if
he
is
not
going
to
look
at
ledgers
at
all
began
mills
ah
the
concealment
of
that
sort
of
thing
is
one
of
the
risks
which
it
is
not
worth
while
to
take
said
the
other
dropping
for
a
moment
the
deferential
attitude
mills
was
silent
again
then
have
you
bought
that
option
in
boston
coppers
he
asked
yes
i
bought
mills
glanced
at
the
clock
as
taynton
rose
to
go
still
only
a
quarter
to
twelve
he
said
if
you
have
time
you
might
give
me
a
detailed
statement
i
hardly
know
what
you
have
done
it
take
a
couple
of
minutes
taynton
glanced
at
the
clock
likewise
and
then
put
down
his
hat
again
i
can
just
spare
the
time
he
said
but
i
must
get
home
by
twelve
i
have
unfortunately
come
out
without
my
latchkey
and
i
do
not
like
keeping
the
servants
up
he
pressed
his
fingers
over
his
eyes
a
moment
and
then
spoke
ten
minutes
later
he
was
in
the
of
the
lift
again
and
by
twelve
he
had
been
admitted
into
his
own
house
apologising
most
amiably
to
his
servant
for
having
kept
him
up
there
were
a
few
letters
for
him
and
he
opened
and
read
those
then
lit
his
and
went
upstairs
but
instead
of
undressing
sat
for
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
in
his
armchair
thinking
then
he
spoke
softly
to
himself
i
think
dear
mills
means
mischief
in
some
way
he
said
but
really
for
the
moment
it
puzzles
me
to
know
what
however
i
shall
see
tomorrow
ah
i
wonder
if
i
guess
then
he
went
to
bed
but
contrary
to
custom
did
not
get
to
sleep
for
a
long
time
but
when
he
did
there
was
a
smile
on
his
lips
a
patient
contented
smile
chapter
iii
taynton
statement
to
his
partner
which
had
taken
him
so
few
minutes
to
give
was
of
course
concerned
only
with
the
latest
financial
operation
which
he
had
just
embarked
in
but
for
the
sake
of
the
reader
it
will
be
necessary
to
go
a
little
further
back
and
give
quite
shortly
the
main
features
of
the
situation
in
which
he
and
his
partner
found
themselves
placed
briefly
then
just
two
years
ago
at
the
time
peace
was
declared
in
south
africa
the
two
partners
of
taynton
and
mills
had
sold
out
of
morris
assheton
securities
which
owing
to
their
excellent
management
was
then
worth
and
seeing
a
quite
unrivalled
opportunity
of
making
their
fortunes
had
become
heavy
purchasers
of
south
african
mines
for
they
reasoned
that
with
peace
once
declared
it
was
absolutely
certain
that
prices
would
go
up
but
as
is
sometimes
the
way
with
absolute
certainties
the
opposite
had
happened
and
they
had
gone
down
they
cut
their
loss
however
and
proceeded
to
buy
american
rails
in
six
months
they
had
entirely
repaired
the
damage
and
seeing
further
unrivalled
opportunities
from
time
to
time
in
buying
motorcar
shares
in
running
a
theatre
and
other
schemes
had
managed
a
month
ago
to
lose
all
that
was
left
of
the
being
therefore
already
so
deeply
committed
it
was
mere
prudence
the
mere
instinct
of
that
had
led
them
to
sell
out
the
remaining
and
taynton
had
bought
an
option
in
boston
copper
with
it
the
manner
of
an
option
is
as
follows
boston
copper
was
quoted
at
and
by
paying
a
premium
of
twelve
shillings
and
sixpence
per
share
they
were
entitled
to
buy
boston
copper
shares
any
time
within
the
next
three
months
at
a
price
of
supposing
therefore
as
taynton
on
very
good
authority
had
supposed
that
boston
copper
a
rapidly
improving
company
rose
a
couple
of
points
within
the
next
three
months
and
so
stood
at
he
had
the
right
of
exercising
his
option
and
buying
them
at
thus
making
per
share
but
a
higher
rise
than
this
was
confidently
expected
and
taynton
though
not
really
of
an
over
sanguine
disposition
certainly
hoped
to
make
good
the
greater
part
if
not
all
of
their
somewhat
large
defalcations
he
had
bought
an
option
of
shares
the
option
of
which
cost
or
would
cost
at
the
end
of
those
months
rather
over
in
other
words
the
moment
that
the
shares
rose
to
a
price
higher
than
all
further
appreciation
was
pure
gain
if
they
did
not
rise
so
high
he
would
of
course
not
exercise
the
option
and
sacrifice
the
money
that
was
certainly
a
very
unpleasant
thing
to
contemplate
but
it
had
been
more
unpleasant
when
so
far
as
he
knew
morris
was
on
the
verge
of
matrimony
and
would
then
step
into
the
management
of
his
own
affairs
but
bad
though
it
all
was
the
situation
had
certainly
been
immensely
ameliorated
this
evening
since
on
the
one
hand
his
partner
had
it
was
not
unreasonable
to
hope
said
to
madge
father
things
about
morris
that
made
his
marriage
with
madge
exceedingly
unlikely
while
on
the
other
hand
even
if
it
happened
his
affairs
according
to
his
own
wish
would
remain
in
taynton
hands
with
the
same
completeness
as
heretofore
it
would
of
course
be
necessary
to
pay
him
his
income
and
though
this
would
be
a
great
strain
on
the
finances
of
the
two
partners
it
was
manageable
besides
taynton
sincerely
hoped
that
this
would
not
be
necessary
the
money
which
was
assheton
for
her
lifetime
was
in
his
hands
also
so
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
now
the
composition
and
nature
of
the
extraordinary
animal
called
man
is
so
unexpected
and
unlikely
that
any
analysis
of
taynton
character
may
seem
almost
grotesque
it
is
a
fact
nevertheless
that
his
was
a
nature
capable
of
great
things
it
is
also
a
fact
that
he
had
long
ago
been
deeply
and
bitterly
contrite
for
the
original
dishonesty
of
using
the
money
of
his
client
but
by
aid
of
those
strange
perversities
of
nature
he
had
by
this
time
honestly
and
sincerely
got
to
regard
all
their
subsequent
employments
of
it
merely
as
efforts
on
his
part
to
make
right
an
original
wrong
he
wanted
to
repair
his
fault
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
to
commit
it
again
was
the
only
means
at
his
disposal
for
doing
so
a
strain
too
of
puritan
piety
was
bound
up
in
the
constitution
of
his
soul
and
in
private
life
he
exercised
high
morality
and
was
also
kind
and
charitable
he
belonged
to
guilds
and
societies
that
had
as
their
object
the
improvement
and
moral
advancement
of
young
men
he
was
a
liberal
patron
of
educational
schemes
he
sang
a
fervent
and
fruity
tenor
in
the
choir
of
agnes
he
was
a
regular
communicant
his
nature
looked
toward
good
and
turned
its
eyes
away
from
evil
to
do
him
justice
he
was
not
a
hypocrite
though
if
all
about
him
were
known
and
a
plebiscite
taken
it
is
probable
that
he
would
be
unanimously
condemned
yet
the
universal
opinion
would
be
wrong
he
was
no
hypocrite
but
only
had
the
bump
of
enormously
developed
he
had
cheated
and
swindled
but
he
was
genuinely
opposed
to
cheating
and
swindling
he
was
cheating
and
swindling
now
in
buying
the
option
of
boston
copper
but
he
did
not
know
that
he
wanted
to
repair
the
original
wrong
to
hand
back
to
morris
his
fortune
unimpaired
and
also
to
save
himself
but
of
these
two
wants
the
second
it
must
be
confessed
was
infinitely
the
stronger
to
save
himself
there
was
perhaps
nothing
that
he
would
stick
at
however
it
was
his
constant
wish
and
prayer
that
he
might
not
be
led
into
temptation
he
knew
well
what
his
particular
temptation
was
namely
this
instinct
of
and
constantly
thought
and
meditated
about
it
he
knew
that
he
was
hardly
himself
when
the
stress
of
it
came
on
him
it
was
like
a
possession
mills
though
an
excellent
partner
and
a
man
of
most
industrious
habits
had
so
taynton
would
have
admitted
one
little
weak
spot
he
never
was
at
the
office
till
rather
late
in
the
morning
true
when
he
came
he
soon
made
up
for
lost
time
for
he
was
possessed
as
we
have
seen
of
a
notable
quickness
and
agility
of
mind
but
sometimes
taynton
found
that
he
was
himself
forced
to
be
idle
till
mills
turned
up
if
his
signature
or
what
not
was
required
for
papers
before
work
could
be
further
proceeded
with
this
in
fact
was
the
case
next
morning
and
from
half
past
eleven
taynton
had
to
sit
idly
in
his
office
as
far
as
the
work
of
the
firm
was
concerned
until
his
partner
arrived
it
was
a
little
tiresome
that
this
should
happen
because
there
was
nothing
else
that
need
detain
him
except
those
deeds
for
the
execution
of
which
his
partner
signature
was
necessary
and
he
could
if
only
mills
had
been
punctual
have
gone
out
to
rottingdean
before
lunch
and
inspected
the
church
school
there
in
the
erection
of
which
he
had
taken
so
energetic
an
interest
timmins
however
the
old
head
clerk
was
in
the
office
with
him
and
taynton
always
liked
a
chat
with
timmins
and
the
grandson
just
come
home
has
he
mr
timmins
he
was
saying
i
must
come
and
see
him
why
he
be
six
years
old
wo
he
by
now
yes
sir
turned
six
dear
me
how
time
goes
on
the
morning
is
going
on
too
and
still
mills
is
here
he
took
a
quill
pen
and
drew
a
half
sheet
of
paper
toward
him
poised
his
pen
a
moment
and
then
wrote
quickly
what
a
pity
i
ca
sign
for
him
he
said
passing
his
paper
over
to
the
clerk
look
at
that
now
even
you
timmins
though
you
have
seen
mills
handwriting
ten
thousand
times
would
be
ready
to
swear
that
the
signature
was
his
would
you
not
timmins
looked
scrutinisingly
at
it
well
i
sure
sir
what
a
forger
you
would
have
made
he
said
admiringly
i
would
have
sworn
that
was
mills
own
hand
of
write
it
wonderful
sir
taynton
sighed
and
took
the
paper
again
yes
it
is
like
is
it
he
said
and
it
so
easy
to
do
luckily
forgers
do
know
the
way
to
forge
properly
and
what
might
that
be
sir
asked
timmins
why
to
throw
yourself
mentally
into
the
nature
of
the
man
whose
handwriting
you
wish
to
forge
of
course
one
has
to
know
the
handwriting
thoroughly
well
but
if
one
does
that
one
just
has
to
visualise
it
and
then
as
i
said
project
oneself
into
the
other
not
laboriously
copy
the
handwriting
let
try
another
ah
who
is
that
letter
from
assheton
is
it
let
me
look
at
the
signature
just
once
again
taynton
closed
his
eyes
a
moment
after
looking
at
it
then
he
took
his
quill
and
wrote
quickly
you
would
swear
to
that
too
would
you
not
timmins
he
asked
why
god
bless
me
yes
sir
said
he
swear
to
it
on
the
book
the
door
opened
and
as
godfrey
mills
came
in
taynton
tweaked
the
paper
out
of
timmins
hand
and
tore
it
up
it
might
perhaps
seem
strange
to
dear
mills
that
his
partner
had
been
forging
his
signature
though
only
in
jest
i
rather
late
said
mills
not
at
all
my
dear
fellow
said
taynton
without
the
slightest
touch
of
how
are
you
there
very
little
to
do
i
want
your
signature
to
this
and
this
and
your
careful
perusal
of
that
assheton
letter
no
that
only
concerns
me
i
have
dealt
with
it
a
quarter
of
an
hour
was
sufficient
and
at
the
end
timmins
carried
the
papers
away
leaving
the
two
partners
together
then
as
soon
as
the
door
closed
mills
spoke
i
been
thinking
over
our
conversation
of
last
night
he
said
and
there
are
some
points
i
do
think
you
have
quite
appreciated
which
i
should
like
to
put
before
you
something
inside
taynton
brain
the
same
watcher
perhaps
who
looked
at
morris
so
closely
the
evening
before
said
to
him
he
is
going
to
try
it
on
but
it
was
not
the
watcher
but
his
normal
self
that
answered
he
beamed
gently
on
his
partner
my
dear
fellow
i
might
have
been
sure
that
your
quick
mind
would
have
seen
new
aspects
new
combinations
he
said
mills
leaned
forward
over
the
table
yes
i
have
seen
new
aspects
to
adopt
your
words
he
said
and
i
will
put
them
before
you
these
financial
operations
shall
we
call
them
have
been
going
on
for
two
years
now
have
they
not
you
began
by
losing
a
large
sum
in
south
africans
we
began
corrected
taynton
gently
he
was
looking
at
the
other
quite
calmly
his
face
expressed
no
surprise
at
all
if
there
was
anything
in
his
expression
beyond
that
of
quiet
kindness
it
was
perhaps
pity
i
said
said
mills
in
a
hectoring
tone
and
i
will
soon
explain
why
you
lost
a
large
sum
in
south
africans
but
won
it
back
again
in
americans
you
then
again
and
again
contrary
to
my
advice
embarked
in
perfect
affairs
which
ended
in
our
i
say
here
getting
severely
scratched
and
mauled
altogether
you
have
frittered
away
and
have
placed
the
remaining
ten
in
a
venture
which
to
my
mind
is
as
wild
as
all
the
rest
of
your
unfortunate
ventures
these
speculations
have
almost
without
exception
been
choices
of
your
own
not
mine
that
was
of
the
reasons
why
i
said
not
he
paused
a
moment
another
reason
is
he
said
because
without
any
exception
the
transactions
have
taken
place
on
your
advice
and
in
your
name
not
in
mine
that
was
a
sufficiently
meaning
statement
but
mills
did
not
wish
his
partner
to
be
under
any
misapprehension
as
to
what
he
implied
in
other
words
he
said
i
can
deny
absolutely
all
knowledge
of
the
whole
of
those
operations
taynton
gave
a
sudden
start
as
if
the
significance
of
this
had
only
this
moment
dawned
on
him
as
if
he
had
not
understood
the
first
statement
then
he
seemed
to
collect
himself
you
can
hardly
do
that
he
said
as
i
hold
letters
of
yours
which
imply
such
knowledge
mills
smiled
rather
evilly
ah
it
is
not
worth
while
bluffing
he
said
i
have
never
written
such
a
letter
to
you
you
know
it
is
it
likely
i
should
taynton
apparently
had
no
reply
to
this
but
he
had
a
question
to
ask
why
are
you
taking
up
this
hostile
and
threatening
attitude
i
have
not
meant
to
be
hostile
and
i
have
certainly
not
threatened
replied
mills
i
have
put
before
you
quite
dispassionately
i
hope
certain
facts
indeed
i
should
say
it
was
you
who
had
threatened
in
the
matter
of
those
letters
which
unhappily
have
never
existed
at
all
i
will
proceed
now
what
has
been
my
part
in
this
affair
i
have
observed
you
lost
money
in
speculations
of
which
i
disapproved
but
you
always
knew
best
i
have
advanced
money
to
you
before
now
to
tide
over
embarrassments
that
would
otherwise
have
been
disastrous
by
the
exercise
of
diplomacy
or
lying
yesterday
i
averted
a
very
grave
danger
i
point
out
to
you
also
that
there
is
nothing
to
implicate
me
in
these
these
fraudulent
employments
of
a
client
money
so
i
ask
where
i
come
in
what
do
i
get
by
it
taynton
hands
were
trembling
as
he
fumbled
at
some
papers
on
his
desk
you
know
quite
well
that
we
are
to
share
all
profits
he
said
yes
but
at
present
there
have
not
been
any
i
have
been
to
put
it
plainly
pulling
you
out
of
holes
and
i
think
i
think
my
trouble
ought
to
be
remunerated
i
sincerely
hope
you
will
take
that
view
also
or
shall
i
remind
you
again
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
to
connect
me
with
these
well
frauds
taynton
got
up
from
his
chair
strolled
across
to
the
window
where
he
drew
down
the
blind
a
little
so
as
to
shut
out
the
splash
of
sunlight
that
fell
on
his
table
you
have
been
betting
again
i
suppose
he
asked
quietly
yes
and
have
been
unfortunate
pray
do
not
trouble
to
tell
me
again
how
foolish
it
is
to
gamble
like
that
you
may
be
right
i
have
no
doubt
you
are
right
but
i
think
one
has
as
much
right
to
gamble
with
one
own
money
as
to
do
so
with
the
money
of
other
people
this
apparently
seemed
unanswerable
anyhow
taynton
made
no
reply
then
having
excluded
the
splash
of
sunlight
he
sat
down
again
you
have
not
threatened
you
tell
me
he
said
but
you
have
pointed
out
to
me
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
you
have
had
a
hand
in
certain
transactions
you
say
that
i
know
you
have
helped
me
in
these
transactions
you
say
you
require
remuneration
for
your
services
does
not
that
i
ask
imply
a
threat
does
it
not
mean
that
you
are
blackmailing
me
else
why
should
you
bring
these
facts
i
do
not
dispute
them
to
my
notice
supposing
i
refuse
you
remuneration
mills
had
noted
the
signs
of
agitation
and
anxiety
he
felt
that
he
was
on
safe
ground
the
blackmailer
lives
entirely
on
the
want
of
courage
in
his
victims
you
will
not
i
hope
refuse
me
remuneration
he
said
i
have
not
threatened
you
yet
because
i
feel
sure
you
will
be
wise
i
might
of
course
subsequently
threaten
you
again
there
was
silence
taynton
had
picked
up
a
quill
pen
the
same
with
which
he
had
been
writing
before
for
the
nib
was
not
yet
dry
the
law
is
rather
severe
on
blackmailers
he
remarked
it
is
are
you
going
to
bring
an
action
against
me
for
blackmail
will
not
that
imply
the
of
of
certain
ledgers
which
we
agreed
last
night
had
better
remain
shut
again
there
was
silence
there
was
a
completeness
in
this
reasoning
which
rendered
comment
superfluous
how
much
do
you
want
asked
taynton
mills
was
not
so
foolish
as
to
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief
but
he
noted
with
satisfaction
that
there
was
no
sign
of
fight
in
his
adversary
and
partner
i
want
two
thousand
pounds
he
said
at
once
that
is
a
large
sum
it
is
if
it
were
a
small
sum
i
should
not
trouble
you
taynton
again
got
up
and
strayed
aimlessly
about
the
room
i
ca
give
it
you
he
said
i
shall
have
to
sell
out
some
stock
i
am
not
unreasonable
about
a
reasonable
delay
said
mills
you
are
going
to
town
this
afternoon
yes
i
must
there
is
a
good
deal
of
work
to
be
done
it
will
take
me
all
and
you
will
be
back
the
day
after
yes
i
shall
be
back
here
that
night
that
is
to
say
i
shall
not
get
away
from
town
till
the
afternoon
i
should
like
your
definite
answer
then
if
it
is
not
inconvenient
i
could
come
and
see
you
that
night
the
day
after
if
you
wished
taynton
thought
over
this
with
his
habitual
deliberation
you
will
readily
understand
that
all
friendly
relations
between
us
are
quite
over
he
said
you
have
done
a
cruel
and
wicked
thing
but
i
do
see
how
i
can
resist
it
i
should
like
however
to
have
a
little
further
talk
about
it
for
which
i
have
not
time
now
mills
rose
by
all
means
he
said
i
do
not
suppose
i
shall
be
back
here
till
nine
in
the
evening
i
have
had
no
exercise
lately
and
i
think
very
likely
i
shall
get
out
of
the
train
at
falmer
and
walk
over
the
downs
taynton
habitual
courtesy
came
to
his
aid
he
would
have
been
polite
to
a
thief
or
a
murderer
if
he
met
him
socially
those
cool
airs
of
the
downs
are
very
invigorating
he
said
i
will
not
expect
you
therefore
till
half
past
nine
that
night
i
shall
dine
at
home
and
be
alone
thanks
i
must
be
going
i
shall
only
just
catch
my
train
to
town
mills
nodded
a
curt
gesture
of
farewell
and
left
the
room
and
when
he
had
gone
taynton
sat
down
again
in
the
chair
by
the
table
and
remained
there
some
half
hour
he
knew
well
the
soundness
of
his
partner
reasoning
all
he
had
said
was
fatally
and
abominably
true
there
was
no
way
out
of
it
yet
to
pay
money
to
a
blackmailer
was
to
the
legal
mind
a
confession
of
guilt
innocent
people
unless
they
were
abject
fools
did
not
pay
blackmail
they
prosecuted
the
blackmailer
yet
here
too
mills
simple
reasoning
held
good
he
could
not
prosecute
the
blackmailer
since
he
was
not
in
the
fortunate
position
of
being
innocent
but
if
you
paid
a
blackmailer
once
you
were
for
ever
in
his
power
having
once
yielded
it
was
necessary
to
yield
again
he
must
get
some
assurance
that
no
further
levy
would
take
place
he
must
satisfy
himself
that
he
would
be
quit
of
all
future
danger
from
this
quarter
yet
from
whence
was
such
assurance
to
come
he
might
have
it
a
hundred
times
over
in
godfrey
mills
handwriting
but
he
could
never
produce
that
as
evidence
since
again
the
charge
of
fraudulent
employment
of
money
would
be
in
the
air
no
doubt
of
course
the
blackmailer
would
be
sentenced
but
the
cause
of
blackmail
would
necessarily
be
public
no
there
was
no
way
out
two
thousand
pounds
though
frugally
and
simply
as
he
lived
that
was
to
him
a
dreadful
sum
and
represented
the
savings
of
at
least
eighteen
months
this
meant
that
there
was
for
him
another
eighteen
months
of
work
just
when
he
hoped
to
see
his
retirement
coming
close
to
him
mills
demanded
that
he
should
work
an
extra
year
and
a
half
and
out
of
those
few
years
that
in
all
human
probability
still
remained
to
him
in
this
pleasant
world
yet
there
was
no
way
out
half
an
hour
meditation
convinced
him
of
this
and
as
was
his
sensible
plan
when
a
thing
was
inevitable
he
never
either
fought
against
it
nor
wasted
energy
in
regretting
it
and
he
went
slowly
out
of
the
office
into
which
he
had
come
so
briskly
an
hour
or
two
before
but
his
face
expressed
no
sign
of
disquieting
emotion
he
nodded
kindly
to
timmins
and
endorsed
his
desire
to
be
allowed
to
come
and
see
the
grandson
if
anything
was
on
his
mind
or
if
he
was
revolving
some
policy
for
the
future
it
did
not
seem
to
touch
or
sour
that
kindly
pleasant
face
chapter
iv
taynton
did
not
let
these
very
unpleasant
occurrences
interfere
with
the
usual
and
beneficent
course
of
his
life
but
faced
the
crisis
with
that
true
bravery
that
not
only
meets
a
thing
without
flinching
but
meets
it
with
the
higher
courage
of
cheerfulness
serenity
and
ordinary
behaviour
he
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
fact
in
his
usual
manner
enjoying
his
bathe
before
lunch
his
hour
of
the
paper
and
the
quiet
cigar
afterward
his
stroll
over
the
springy
turf
of
the
downs
and
he
enjoyed
also
the
couple
of
hours
of
work
that
brought
him
to
dinner
time
then
afterward
he
spent
his
evening
as
was
his
weekly
custom
at
the
club
for
young
men
which
he
had
founded
where
instead
of
being
exposed
to
the
evening
lures
of
the
and
the
public
house
they
could
spend
on
payment
of
a
really
nominal
subscription
a
quieter
and
more
innocent
hour
over
chess
bagatelle
and
the
illustrated
papers
or
if
more
energetically
disposed
in
the
airy
gymnasium
adjoining
the
where
they
could
indulge
in
friendly
rivalry
with
boxing
gloves
or
or
feed
the
appetites
of
their
growing
muscles
with
and
elastic
contrivances
taynton
had
spent
a
couple
of
hours
there
losing
a
game
of
chess
to
one
youthful
adversary
but
getting
back
his
laurels
over
bagatelle
and
before
he
left
had
arranged
for
a
geological
expedition
to
visit
on
the
whitsuntide
bank
holiday
next
week
the
curious
raised
beach
which
protruded
so
remarkably
from
the
range
of
chalk
downs
some
ten
miles
away
on
returning
home
it
is
true
he
had
deviated
a
little
from
his
usual
habits
for
instead
of
devoting
the
before
to
the
leisurely
perusal
of
the
evening
paper
he
had
merely
given
it
one
glance
observing
that
copper
was
strong
and
that
boston
copper
in
particular
had
risen
half
a
point
and
had
then
sat
till
doing
nothing
whatever
a
habit
to
which
he
was
not
generally
addicted
he
was
seated
in
his
office
next
morning
and
was
in
fact
on
the
point
of
leaving
for
his
bathe
for
this
hot
genial
june
was
marching
on
its
sunny
way
uninterrupted
by
winds
or
rain
when
timmins
after
discreetly
tapping
entered
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
morris
assheton
sir
to
see
you
he
said
i
said
i
would
find
out
if
you
were
disengaged
and
could
hardly
restrain
him
from
coming
in
with
me
the
young
gentleman
seems
very
excited
and
agitated
hardly
himself
sir
indeed
show
him
in
said
taynton
a
moment
afterward
the
door
burst
open
and
banged
to
again
behind
morris
high
colour
flamed
in
his
face
his
black
eyes
sparkled
with
vivid
dangerous
light
and
he
had
no
salutation
for
his
old
friend
i
come
on
a
very
unpleasant
business
he
said
his
voice
not
in
control
taynton
got
up
he
had
only
had
one
moment
of
preparation
and
he
thought
at
any
rate
that
he
knew
for
certain
what
this
unpleasant
business
must
be
evidently
mills
had
given
him
away
for
what
reason
he
had
done
so
he
could
not
guess
after
his
experience
of
yesterday
it
might
have
been
from
pure
devilry
or
again
he
might
have
feared
that
in
desperation
taynton
would
take
that
extreme
step
of
prosecuting
him
for
blackmail
but
for
that
moment
taynton
believed
that
morris
agitation
must
be
caused
by
this
and
it
says
much
for
the
iron
of
his
nerve
that
he
did
not
betray
himself
by
a
tremor
my
dear
morris
he
said
i
must
ask
you
to
pull
yourself
together
you
are
out
of
your
own
control
sit
down
please
and
be
silent
for
a
minute
then
tell
me
calmly
what
is
the
matter
morris
sat
down
as
he
was
told
but
the
calmness
was
not
conspicuous
calm
he
said
would
you
be
calm
in
my
circumstances
do
you
think
you
have
not
yet
told
me
what
they
are
said
taynton
i
just
seen
madge
templeton
he
said
i
met
her
privately
by
appointment
and
she
told
me
she
told
me
master
of
himself
though
he
was
taynton
had
one
moment
of
physical
giddiness
so
complete
and
sudden
was
the
revulsion
and
reaction
that
took
place
in
his
brain
a
moment
before
he
had
known
he
thought
for
certain
that
his
own
utter
ruin
was
imminent
now
he
knew
that
it
was
not
that
and
though
he
had
made
one
wrong
conjecture
as
to
what
the
unpleasant
business
was
he
did
not
think
that
his
second
guess
was
far
astray
take
your
time
morris
he
said
and
my
dear
boy
try
to
calm
yourself
you
say
i
should
not
be
calm
in
your
circumstances
perhaps
i
should
not
but
i
should
make
an
effort
tell
me
everything
slowly
omitting
nothing
this
speech
combined
with
the
authoritative
personality
of
taynton
had
an
extraordinary
effect
on
morris
he
sat
quiet
a
moment
or
two
then
spoke
yes
you
are
quite
right
he
said
and
after
all
i
have
only
conjecture
to
go
on
yet
and
i
have
been
behaving
as
if
it
was
proved
truth
god
if
it
is
proved
to
be
true
though
i
expose
him
i
i
horsewhip
him
i
murder
him
taynton
slapped
the
table
with
his
open
hand
now
morris
none
of
these
wild
words
he
said
i
will
not
listen
to
you
for
a
moment
if
you
do
not
control
yourself
once
again
and
this
time
more
permanently
the
man
authority
asserted
itself
morris
again
sat
silent
for
a
time
then
spoke
evenly
and
quietly
two
nights
ago
you
were
dining
with
us
he
said
and
madge
was
there
do
you
remember
my
asking
her
if
i
might
come
to
see
them
and
she
said
she
and
her
mother
would
be
out
all
day
yes
i
remember
perfectly
said
taynton
well
yesterday
afternoon
i
was
motoring
by
the
park
and
i
saw
madge
sitting
on
the
lawn
i
stopped
the
motor
and
watched
she
sat
there
for
nearly
an
hour
and
then
sir
richard
came
out
of
the
house
and
they
walked
up
and
down
the
lawn
together
ah
you
must
have
been
mistaken
said
taynton
i
know
the
spot
you
mean
on
the
road
where
you
can
see
the
lawn
but
it
half
a
mile
off
it
must
have
been
some
friend
of
hers
perhaps
staying
in
the
house
morris
shook
his
head
i
was
not
mistaken
he
said
for
yesterday
evening
i
got
a
note
from
her
saying
she
had
posted
it
secretly
but
that
she
must
see
me
though
she
was
forbidden
to
do
so
or
to
hold
any
communication
with
me
forbidden
ejaculated
taynton
yes
forbidden
well
this
morning
i
went
to
the
place
she
named
outside
on
the
downs
beyond
the
park
gate
and
saw
her
somebody
has
been
telling
vile
lies
about
me
to
her
father
i
think
i
know
who
it
is
taynton
held
up
his
hand
stop
he
said
let
us
have
your
conjecture
afterward
tell
me
first
not
what
you
guess
but
what
happened
arrange
it
all
in
your
mind
tell
it
me
as
connectedly
as
you
can
morris
paused
a
moment
well
i
met
madge
as
i
told
you
and
this
was
her
story
three
days
ago
she
and
her
father
and
mother
were
at
lunch
and
they
had
been
talking
in
the
most
friendly
way
about
me
and
it
was
arranged
to
ask
me
to
spend
all
yesterday
with
them
madge
as
you
know
the
next
night
was
dining
with
us
and
it
was
agreed
that
she
should
ask
me
verbally
after
lunch
she
and
her
father
went
out
riding
and
when
they
returned
they
found
that
your
partner
mills
had
come
to
call
he
stayed
for
tea
and
after
tea
had
a
talk
alone
with
sir
richard
while
she
and
her
mother
sat
out
on
the
lawn
soon
after
he
had
gone
sir
richard
sent
for
lady
templeton
and
it
was
nearly
when
she
left
him
again
she
noticed
at
dinner
that
both
her
father
and
mother
seemed
very
grave
and
when
madge
went
up
to
bed
her
mother
said
that
perhaps
they
had
better
not
ask
me
over
as
there
was
some
thought
of
their
being
away
all
day
also
if
i
suggested
coming
over
when
madge
dined
with
us
she
was
to
give
that
excuse
that
was
all
she
was
told
for
the
time
being
morris
paused
again
you
are
telling
this
very
clearly
and
well
my
dear
boy
said
the
lawyer
very
gravely
and
kindly
it
is
so
simple
said
he
with
a
biting
emphasis
then
next
morning
after
breakfast
her
father
sent
for
her
he
told
her
that
they
had
learned
certain
things
about
me
which
made
them
think
it
better
not
to
see
any
more
of
me
what
they
were
she
was
not
told
but
i
was
not
it
appeared
the
sort
of
person
with
whom
they
chose
to
associate
now
before
god
those
things
that
they
were
told
whatever
they
were
were
lies
i
lead
a
straight
and
sober
life
taynton
was
attending
very
closely
thank
god
madge
did
not
believe
a
word
of
it
said
morris
his
face
suddenly
flushing
and
like
a
brick
and
a
true
friend
she
wrote
at
once
to
me
as
i
said
in
order
to
tell
me
all
this
we
talked
over
too
who
it
could
have
been
who
had
said
these
vile
things
to
her
father
there
was
only
one
person
who
could
she
had
ridden
with
her
father
till
then
came
your
partner
sir
richard
saw
nobody
else
nobody
else
called
that
afternoon
no
post
came
in
taynton
had
sprung
up
and
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
in
great
agitation
i
ca
believe
that
he
said
there
must
be
some
other
explanation
godfrey
mills
say
those
things
about
you
it
is
incredible
my
dear
boy
until
it
is
proved
you
really
must
not
let
yourself
believe
that
to
be
possible
you
ca
believe
such
wickedness
against
a
man
one
too
whom
i
have
known
and
trusted
for
years
on
no
evidence
there
is
no
direct
evidence
yet
let
us
leave
that
alone
for
the
moment
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
i
came
here
to
see
him
said
morris
but
i
am
told
he
is
away
so
i
thought
it
better
to
tell
you
yes
quite
right
and
what
else
i
have
written
to
sir
richard
demanding
in
common
justice
that
he
should
see
me
should
tell
me
what
he
has
heard
against
me
and
who
told
him
i
do
think
he
will
refuse
i
do
see
how
he
can
refuse
i
have
asked
him
to
see
me
afternoon
taynton
mentally
examined
this
in
all
its
bearings
apparently
it
satisfied
him
you
have
acted
wisely
and
providently
he
said
but
i
want
to
beg
you
until
you
have
definite
information
to
forbear
from
thinking
that
my
dear
mills
could
conceivably
have
been
the
originator
of
these
scandalous
tales
tales
which
i
know
from
my
knowledge
of
you
are
impossible
to
be
true
from
what
i
know
of
him
however
it
is
impossible
he
could
have
said
such
things
i
can
not
believe
him
capable
of
a
mean
or
deceitful
action
and
that
he
should
be
guilty
of
such
unfathomable
iniquity
is
simply
out
of
the
question
you
must
assume
him
innocent
till
his
guilt
is
proved
but
who
else
could
it
have
been
cried
morris
his
voice
rising
again
it
could
not
have
been
he
said
taynton
firmly
there
was
a
long
silence
then
morris
rose
there
is
one
thing
more
he
said
which
is
the
most
important
of
all
this
foul
scandal
about
me
of
course
i
know
will
be
cleared
up
and
i
shall
be
competent
to
deal
with
the
offender
but
but
madge
and
i
said
other
things
to
each
other
i
told
her
what
i
told
you
that
i
loved
her
and
she
loves
me
the
sternness
the
trouble
the
anxiety
all
melted
from
taynton
face
ah
my
dear
fellow
my
dear
fellow
he
said
with
outstretched
hands
thank
you
for
telling
me
i
am
delighted
overjoyed
and
indeed
as
you
say
that
is
far
more
important
than
anything
else
my
dear
morris
and
is
not
your
mother
charmed
morris
shook
his
head
i
have
not
told
her
yet
and
i
shall
not
till
this
is
cleared
up
it
is
her
birthday
the
day
after
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
her
then
he
rose
i
must
go
he
said
and
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
keep
my
mind
off
accusing
him
until
i
know
but
when
i
think
of
it
i
see
red
taynton
patted
his
shoulder
affectionately
i
should
have
thought
that
you
had
got
something
to
think
about
which
would
make
it
easy
for
you
to
prevent
your
thoughts
straying
elsewhere
he
said
i
shall
need
all
the
distractions
i
can
get
said
morris
rather
grimly
morris
walked
quickly
back
along
the
sea
front
toward
sussex
square
and
remembered
as
he
went
that
he
had
not
yet
bought
any
gift
for
his
mother
on
her
birthday
there
was
something
too
which
she
had
casually
said
a
day
or
two
ago
that
she
wanted
what
was
it
ah
yes
a
new
for
her
in
the
the
shop
she
habitually
dealt
at
for
such
things
a
branch
of
asprey
was
only
a
few
yards
farther
on
and
he
turned
in
to
make
inquiries
as
to
whether
she
had
ordered
it
it
appeared
that
she
had
been
in
that
very
morning
but
the
parcel
had
not
been
sent
yet
so
morris
taking
the
responsibility
on
himself
counterordered
the
plain
red
morocco
book
she
had
chosen
and
chose
another
with
fine
silver
scrollwork
at
the
corners
he
ordered
too
that
a
silver
lettered
inscription
should
be
put
on
it
from
with
the
date
two
days
ahead
june
this
he
gave
instructions
should
be
sent
to
the
house
on
the
morning
of
june
the
day
after
he
wished
it
to
be
sent
so
as
to
arrive
with
the
early
post
on
that
morning
the
promise
which
morris
had
made
his
old
friend
not
to
let
his
thoughts
dwell
on
suspicion
and
conjecture
as
yet
uncertain
of
foundation
was
one
of
those
promises
which
are
made
in
absolute
good
faith
but
which
in
their
very
nature
can
not
be
kept
the
thought
of
the
hideous
treachery
the
gratuitous
falsehood
of
which
in
his
mind
he
felt
convinced
godfrey
mills
had
been
guilty
was
like
blood
soaking
through
a
bandage
all
that
he
could
do
was
to
continue
putting
on
fresh
bandages
that
was
all
of
his
promise
that
he
was
able
to
fulfill
and
in
spite
of
the
bandages
the
blood
stained
and
soaked
its
way
through
in
the
afternoon
he
took
out
the
motor
but
his
joy
in
it
for
the
time
was
dead
and
it
was
only
because
in
the
sense
of
pace
and
swift
movement
he
hoped
to
find
a
narcotic
to
thought
that
he
went
out
at
all
but
there
was
no
narcotic
there
nor
even
in
the
thought
of
this
huge
joy
of
love
that
had
dawned
on
him
was
there
forgetfulness
for
all
else
joy
and
sorrow
and
love
were
for
the
present
separated
from
him
by
these
hideous
and
libellous
things
that
had
been
said
about
him
until
they
were
removed
until
they
passed
into
again
nothing
had
any
significance
for
him
everything
was
coloured
with
them
bitterness
as
of
blood
tinged
everything
hours
too
must
pass
before
they
could
be
removed
this
long
midsummer
day
had
to
draw
to
its
end
night
had
to
pass
the
hour
of
early
dawn
the
long
morning
had
to
be
numbered
with
the
past
before
he
could
even
learn
who
was
responsible
for
this
poisoned
tale
and
when
he
learned
or
rather
when
his
conjecture
was
confirmed
as
to
who
it
was
for
his
supposition
was
conjecture
in
the
sense
that
it
only
wanted
the
actual
seal
of
reality
on
it
what
should
he
do
next
or
rather
what
must
he
do
next
he
felt
that
when
he
knew
absolutely
for
certain
who
had
said
this
about
him
a
force
of
indignation
and
hatred
which
at
present
he
kept
chained
up
must
infallibly
break
its
chain
and
become
merely
a
wild
beast
let
loose
he
felt
he
would
be
no
longer
responsible
for
what
he
did
something
had
to
happen
something
more
than
mere
apology
or
retraction
of
words
to
lie
and
slander
like
that
was
a
crime
an
insult
against
human
and
divine
justice
it
would
be
nothing
for
the
criminal
to
say
he
was
sorry
he
had
to
be
punished
a
man
who
did
that
was
not
fit
to
live
he
was
a
man
no
longer
he
was
a
biting
poisonous
reptile
who
for
the
sake
of
the
community
must
be
expunged
yet
human
justice
which
hanged
people
for
violent
crimes
committed
under
great
provocation
dealt
more
lightly
with
this
far
more
devilish
thing
a
crime
committed
coldly
and
calculatingly
that
had
planned
not
the
mere
death
of
his
body
but
the
disgrace
and
death
of
his
character
godfrey
mills
he
checked
the
word
and
added
to
himself
if
it
was
he
had
morally
tried
to
kill
him
morris
after
his
interview
that
morning
with
taynton
had
lunched
alone
in
sussex
square
his
mother
having
gone
that
day
up
to
london
for
two
nights
his
plan
had
been
to
go
up
with
her
but
he
had
excused
himself
on
the
plea
of
business
with
his
trustees
and
she
had
gone
alone
directly
after
lunch
he
had
taken
the
motor
out
and
had
whirled
along
the
coast
road
past
rottingdean
through
newhaven
and
seaford
and
ten
miles
farther
until
the
suburbs
of
eastbourne
had
begun
there
he
turned
his
thoughts
still
running
a
in
his
head
and
retracing
his
road
had
by
now
come
back
to
within
a
mile
of
brighton
again
the
sun
gilded
the
smooth
channel
the
winds
were
still
the
hot
midsummer
afternoon
lay
heavy
on
the
land
then
he
stopped
the
motor
and
got
out
telling
martin
to
wait
there
he
walked
over
the
strip
of
velvety
down
grass
to
the
edge
of
the
white
cliffs
and
there
sat
down
the
sea
below
him
whispered
and
crawled
above
the
sun
was
the
sole
tenant
of
the
sky
and
east
and
west
the
down
was
empty
of
passengers
he
like
his
soul
was
alone
and
alone
he
had
to
think
these
things
out
yes
this
liar
and
slanderer
whoever
he
was
had
tried
to
kill
him
the
attempt
had
been
too
for
the
chances
had
been
a
thousand
to
one
in
favour
of
the
murderer
but
the
one
chance
had
turned
up
madge
had
loved
him
and
she
had
been
brave
setting
at
defiance
the
order
of
her
father
and
had
seen
him
secretly
and
told
him
all
the
circumstances
of
this
attack
on
him
but
supposing
she
had
been
just
a
shade
less
brave
supposing
her
filial
obedience
had
weighed
an
ounce
heavier
then
he
would
never
have
known
anything
about
it
the
result
would
simply
have
been
as
it
was
meant
to
be
that
the
templetons
were
out
when
he
called
there
would
have
been
a
change
of
subject
in
their
rooms
when
his
name
was
mentioned
other
people
would
have
vaguely
gathered
that
morris
assheton
name
was
not
productive
of
animated
conversation
their
gatherings
would
have
spread
further
while
he
himself
ignorant
of
all
cause
would
have
encountered
cold
shoulders
morris
hands
clutched
at
the
short
down
grass
tearing
it
up
and
scattering
it
he
was
helpless
too
unless
he
took
the
law
into
his
own
hands
it
would
do
no
good
young
as
he
was
he
knew
that
to
bring
any
action
for
defamation
of
character
since
the
world
only
says
if
a
man
justifies
himself
by
the
only
legal
means
in
his
power
there
must
have
been
something
in
it
since
it
was
said
no
legal
remedy
no
fines
or
even
imprisonment
far
less
apology
and
retraction
satisfied
justice
there
were
only
two
courses
open
one
to
regard
the
slander
as
a
splash
of
mud
thrown
by
some
vile
thing
that
sat
in
the
gutter
and
simply
ignore
it
the
other
to
do
something
himself
to
strike
to
hit
with
his
bodily
hands
whatever
the
result
of
his
violence
was
he
felt
his
rise
and
brace
themselves
at
the
thought
all
the
strength
and
violence
of
his
young
manhood
with
its
firm
sinews
and
supple
joints
told
him
that
it
was
his
willing
and
active
servant
and
would
do
his
pleasure
he
wanted
to
smash
the
jaw
bone
that
had
formed
these
lies
and
he
wanted
the
world
to
know
he
had
done
so
yet
that
was
not
enough
he
wanted
to
throttle
the
throat
from
which
the
words
had
come
the
man
ought
to
be
killed
it
was
right
to
kill
him
just
as
it
was
right
to
kill
a
poisonous
snake
that
somehow
disguised
itself
as
a
man
and
was
received
into
the
houses
of
men
indeed
should
morris
be
told
as
he
felt
sure
he
would
be
who
his
slanderer
and
defamer
was
that
gentleman
would
be
wise
to
keep
out
of
his
way
with
him
in
such
a
mood
there
was
danger
and
death
abroad
on
this
calm
hot
summer
afternoon
chapter
v
it
was
about
four
on
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
and
taynton
was
prolonging
his
hour
of
quietude
after
lunch
and
encroaching
thereby
into
the
time
he
daily
dedicated
to
exercise
it
was
but
seldom
that
he
broke
into
the
routine
of
habits
so
long
formed
and
indeed
the
most
violent
rain
or
snow
of
winter
the
most
cutting
easterly
blasts
of
march
never
unless
he
had
some
definite
bodily
ailment
kept
him
indoors
or
deprived
him
of
his
brisk
trudge
over
the
downs
or
along
the
sea
front
but
occasionally
when
the
weather
was
unusually
hot
he
granted
himself
the
indulgence
of
sitting
still
instead
of
walking
and
certainly
the
least
lenient
judge
might
say
that
there
were
strong
extenuating
circumstances
in
his
favour
for
the
heat
of
the
past
week
had
been
piling
itself
up
like
the
heaped
waters
of
flood
and
this
afternoon
was
intense
in
its
heat
its
stillness
and
sultriness
it
had
been
sunless
all
day
and
all
day
the
blanket
of
clouds
that
beset
the
sky
had
been
gathering
themselves
into
blacker
and
more
density
there
would
certainly
be
a
thunderstorm
before
morning
and
the
approach
of
it
made
taynton
feel
that
he
really
had
not
the
energy
to
walk
by
and
by
perhaps
he
might
be
tempted
to
go
in
quest
of
coolness
along
the
sea
front
or
perhaps
later
in
the
evening
he
might
as
he
sometimes
did
take
a
carriage
up
on
to
the
downs
and
come
gently
home
to
a
late
supper
he
would
have
time
for
that
for
according
to
arrangement
his
partner
was
to
drop
in
about
half
past
nine
that
evening
if
he
got
back
at
nine
supposing
he
went
at
all
he
would
have
time
to
have
some
food
before
receiving
him
he
sat
in
a
pleasant
parquetted
room
looking
out
into
the
small
square
garden
at
the
back
of
his
house
in
montpellier
road
big
awnings
stretched
from
the
window
over
the
broad
gravel
path
outside
and
in
spite
of
the
excessive
heat
the
room
was
full
of
dim
coolness
there
was
but
little
furniture
in
it
and
it
presented
the
strongest
possible
contrast
to
the
appointments
of
his
partner
flat
with
its
heavy
decorations
its
somewhat
gross
luxury
a
few
hung
on
the
white
walls
a
few
persian
rugs
strewed
the
floor
a
big
bookcase
with
china
on
the
top
filled
one
end
of
the
room
his
a
half
dozen
of
chippendale
chairs
and
the
sofa
where
he
now
lay
practically
completed
the
inventory
of
the
room
three
or
four
bronzes
a
narcissus
a
italian
francis
and
a
couple
of
greek
reproductions
stood
on
the
but
the
whole
room
breathed
an
atmosphere
of
aesthetic
asceticism
since
lunch
taynton
had
glanced
at
the
paper
and
also
looked
up
the
trains
from
lewes
in
order
to
assure
himself
that
he
need
not
expect
his
partner
till
half
past
nine
and
since
then
though
his
hands
and
his
eyes
had
been
idle
his
mind
had
been
very
busy
yet
for
all
its
business
he
had
not
arrived
at
much
morris
godfrey
mills
and
himself
he
had
placed
these
three
figures
in
all
sorts
of
positions
in
his
mind
and
yet
every
combination
of
them
was
somehow
terrible
and
menacing
try
as
he
would
he
could
not
construct
a
peaceful
or
secure
arrangement
of
them
in
whatever
way
he
grouped
them
there
was
danger
the
kitchen
passage
ran
out
at
right
angles
to
the
room
in
which
he
sat
and
formed
one
side
of
the
garden
the
windows
in
it
were
high
up
so
that
it
did
not
overlook
the
flowerbeds
and
on
this
torrid
afternoon
they
were
all
fully
open
suddenly
from
just
inside
came
the
fierce
clanging
peal
of
a
bell
which
made
him
start
from
his
recumbent
position
it
was
the
bell
as
he
knew
and
as
it
continued
ringing
as
if
a
maniac
grip
was
on
the
handle
he
heard
the
steps
of
his
servant
running
along
the
stone
floor
of
the
passage
to
see
what
imperative
summons
this
was
then
as
the
front
door
was
opened
the
bell
ceased
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
and
the
moment
afterward
he
heard
morris
voice
shrill
and
commanding
but
he
has
got
to
see
me
he
cried
what
the
use
of
you
going
to
ask
if
he
will
taynton
went
to
the
door
of
his
room
which
opened
into
the
hall
come
in
morris
he
said
though
it
had
been
morris
hand
which
had
raised
so
uncontrolled
a
clamour
and
his
voice
that
just
now
had
been
so
uncontrolled
there
was
no
sign
when
the
door
of
taynton
room
had
closed
behind
them
that
there
was
any
excitement
of
any
sort
raging
within
him
he
sat
down
at
once
in
a
chair
opposite
the
window
and
taynton
saw
that
in
spite
of
the
heat
of
the
day
and
the
violence
of
that
storm
which
he
knew
was
yelling
and
screaming
through
his
brain
his
face
was
absolutely
white
he
sat
with
his
hands
on
the
arms
of
the
chippendale
chair
and
they
too
were
quite
still
i
have
seen
sir
richard
said
he
and
i
came
back
at
once
to
see
you
he
has
told
me
everything
godfrey
mills
has
been
lying
about
me
and
slandering
me
taynton
sat
down
heavily
on
the
sofa
no
no
do
say
it
do
say
it
he
murmured
it
ca
be
true
i
ca
believe
it
but
it
is
true
and
you
have
got
to
believe
it
he
suggested
that
you
should
go
and
talk
it
over
with
him
i
will
drive
you
up
in
the
car
if
you
wish
taynton
waved
his
hand
with
a
negative
gesture
no
no
not
at
once
he
cried
i
must
think
it
over
i
must
get
used
to
this
dreadful
this
appalling
shock
i
am
utterly
distraught
morris
turned
to
him
and
across
his
face
for
one
moment
there
shot
swift
as
a
a
quiver
of
rage
so
rabid
that
he
looked
scarcely
human
but
like
some
greek
presentment
of
the
furies
or
revenge
never
so
thought
his
old
friend
had
he
seen
such
glorious
youthful
beauty
so
instinct
and
inspired
with
hate
it
was
the
demoniacal
force
of
that
which
lent
such
splendour
to
it
but
it
passed
in
a
second
and
morris
still
very
pale
very
quiet
spoke
to
him
where
is
he
he
asked
i
must
see
him
at
once
it
wo
keep
then
he
sprang
up
his
rage
again
mastering
him
what
shall
i
do
it
with
he
said
what
shall
i
do
it
with
for
the
moment
taynton
forgot
himself
and
his
anxieties
morris
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
he
cried
thank
god
nobody
but
me
heard
you
say
that
morris
seemed
not
to
be
attending
where
is
he
he
said
again
are
you
concealing
him
here
i
have
already
been
to
your
office
and
he
was
there
and
to
his
flat
and
he
was
there
thank
god
ejaculated
the
lawyer
by
all
means
if
you
like
but
i
got
to
see
him
you
know
where
is
he
he
is
away
in
town
said
taynton
but
he
will
be
back
now
attend
of
course
you
must
see
him
i
quite
understand
that
but
you
must
see
him
alone
while
you
are
like
this
no
i
do
want
to
said
morris
i
should
like
other
people
to
see
what
i
got
to
to
say
to
him
that
that
partner
of
yours
he
has
from
this
moment
ceased
to
be
my
partner
said
taynton
brokenly
i
could
never
again
sign
what
he
has
signed
or
work
with
him
or
or
except
once
see
him
again
he
is
coming
here
by
appointment
at
nine
suppose
that
we
all
meet
here
we
have
both
got
to
see
him
morris
nodded
and
went
toward
the
door
a
sudden
spasm
of
anxiety
seemed
to
seize
taynton
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
he
asked
i
do
know
drive
to
falmer
park
perhaps
and
tell
sir
richard
you
can
not
see
him
immediately
will
you
see
him
yes
i
will
call
morning
morris
promise
me
you
will
do
nothing
rash
nothing
that
will
bring
sorrow
on
all
those
who
love
you
i
shall
bring
a
little
sorrow
on
a
man
who
hates
me
said
he
he
went
out
and
taynton
sat
down
again
his
mouth
compressed
into
hard
lines
his
forehead
heavily
frowning
he
could
not
permanently
prevent
morris
from
meeting
godfrey
mills
besides
it
was
his
right
to
do
so
yet
how
fraught
with
awful
risks
to
himself
that
meeting
would
be
morris
might
easily
make
a
violent
even
a
murderous
assault
on
the
man
but
mills
was
an
expert
boxer
and
wrestler
science
would
probably
get
the
upper
hand
of
blind
rage
but
how
deadly
a
weapon
mills
had
in
store
against
himself
he
would
certainly
tell
morris
that
if
one
partner
had
slandered
him
the
other
whom
he
so
trusted
and
revered
had
robbed
him
he
would
say
too
that
taynton
had
been
cognizant
of
and
had
approved
his
slanders
there
was
no
end
to
the
ruin
that
would
certainly
be
brought
about
his
head
if
they
met
mills
train
too
would
have
left
london
by
now
there
was
no
chance
of
stopping
him
then
there
was
another
danger
he
had
not
foreseen
and
it
was
too
late
to
stop
that
now
morris
was
going
again
to
falmer
park
had
indeed
started
and
that
afternoon
godfrey
mills
would
get
out
of
the
train
as
he
had
planned
at
the
station
just
below
and
walk
back
over
the
downs
to
brighton
what
if
they
met
there
alone
for
an
hour
perhaps
taynton
delved
at
these
problems
and
at
the
end
even
it
did
not
seem
as
if
he
had
solved
them
satisfactorily
for
when
he
went
out
of
his
house
as
he
did
at
the
end
of
this
time
to
get
a
little
breeze
if
such
was
obtainable
his
face
was
still
shadowed
and
overclouded
overclouded
too
was
the
sky
and
as
he
stepped
out
into
the
street
from
his
the
hot
air
struck
him
like
a
buffet
and
in
his
troubled
and
apprehensive
mood
it
felt
as
if
some
hot
hand
warned
him
by
a
blow
not
to
venture
out
of
his
house
but
the
house
somehow
in
the
last
hour
had
become
terrible
to
him
any
movement
or
action
even
on
a
day
like
this
when
only
madmen
and
the
english
go
abroad
was
better
than
the
nervous
waiting
in
his
darkened
room
dreadful
forces
forces
of
ruin
and
murder
and
disgrace
were
abroad
in
the
world
of
men
the
menace
of
the
low
black
clouds
and
stifling
heat
was
more
bearable
he
wanted
to
get
away
from
his
house
which
was
permeated
and
soaked
in
association
with
the
other
two
actors
who
in
company
with
himself
had
surely
some
tragedy
for
which
the
curtain
was
already
rung
up
some
dreadful
scene
was
already
prepared
for
them
the
setting
and
stage
were
ready
the
prompter
and
who
was
he
was
in
the
box
ready
to
tell
them
the
next
line
if
any
of
them
faltered
the
prompter
surely
he
was
destiny
fate
the
irresistible
course
of
events
with
which
no
man
can
struggle
any
more
than
the
actor
can
struggle
with
or
alter
the
lines
that
are
set
down
for
him
he
may
mumble
them
he
may
act
dispiritedly
and
tamely
but
he
has
undertaken
a
certain
part
he
has
to
go
through
with
it
though
it
was
a
populous
hour
of
the
day
there
were
but
few
people
abroad
when
taynton
came
out
to
the
sea
front
a
few
cabs
stood
by
the
railings
that
bounded
the
broad
asphalt
path
which
faced
the
sea
but
the
drivers
of
these
despairing
of
fares
were
for
the
most
part
dozing
on
the
boxes
or
with
a
more
set
purpose
were
frankly
slumbering
in
the
interior
the
dismal
little
wooden
shelters
that
punctuated
the
parade
were
deserted
the
pier
stretched
an
untenanted
length
of
boards
over
the
still
sea
and
it
seemed
as
if
nature
herself
was
waiting
for
some
elemental
catastrophe
and
though
the
afternoon
was
of
such
hideous
and
sultry
heat
taynton
though
he
walked
somewhat
more
briskly
than
his
wont
was
conscious
of
no
genial
heat
that
produced
perspiration
and
the
natural
reaction
and
cooling
of
the
skin
some
internal
excitement
and
fever
of
the
brain
cut
off
all
external
things
the
loneliness
the
want
of
correspondence
that
fever
brings
between
external
and
internal
conditions
was
on
him
at
one
moment
in
spite
of
the
heat
he
shivered
at
another
he
felt
that
an
apoplexy
must
strike
him
for
some
half
hour
he
walked
to
and
fro
along
the
between
the
blackness
of
the
sky
and
the
water
and
then
his
thoughts
turned
to
the
downs
above
this
stricken
place
where
even
in
the
sultriest
days
some
breath
of
wind
was
always
moving
just
opposite
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
was
the
street
that
led
steeply
upward
to
the
station
he
went
up
it
it
was
about
seven
that
evening
that
the
storm
burst
a
few
huge
drops
of
rain
fell
on
the
hot
pavements
then
the
rain
ceased
again
and
the
big
splashes
dried
as
if
the
stones
had
been
blotting
paper
that
sucked
the
moisture
in
then
without
other
warning
a
streamer
of
fire
split
the
steeple
of
agnes
church
just
opposite
taynton
house
and
the
crash
of
thunder
answered
it
more
quickly
than
his
servant
had
run
to
open
the
door
to
morris
furious
ringing
of
the
bell
at
that
the
sluices
of
heaven
were
opened
and
heaven
artillery
thundered
its
salvoes
to
the
flare
of
the
reckless
storm
in
the
next
a
dozen
houses
in
brighton
were
struck
while
the
choked
gutters
overflowing
on
to
the
streets
made
ravines
and
waterways
down
the
roadways
then
the
thunder
and
lightning
ceased
but
the
rain
still
poured
down
relentlessly
and
windlessly
a
flood
of
perpendicular
water
taynton
had
gone
out
without
umbrella
and
when
he
let
himself
in
by
his
at
his
own
about
eight
it
was
no
wonder
that
he
wrung
out
his
coat
and
trousers
so
that
he
should
not
soak
his
persian
rugs
but
from
him
as
from
the
charged
skies
some
tension
had
passed
this
tempest
which
had
so
cooled
the
air
and
restored
the
equilibrium
of
its
forces
had
smoothed
the
frowning
creases
of
his
brow
and
when
the
servant
hurried
up
at
the
sound
of
the
banged
he
found
his
master
soaked
indeed
but
serene
yes
i
got
caught
by
the
storm
williams
he
said
and
i
am
drenched
the
lightning
was
terrific
was
it
not
i
will
just
change
and
have
a
little
supper
some
cold
meat
anything
that
there
is
yes
you
might
take
my
coat
at
once
he
divested
himself
of
this
and
i
expect
morris
this
evening
he
said
he
will
probably
have
dined
but
if
not
i
am
sure
mrs
otter
will
toss
up
a
hot
dish
for
him
oh
yes
and
mills
will
be
here
at
nine
or
even
sooner
as
i
can
not
think
he
will
have
walked
from
falmer
as
he
intended
but
whenever
he
comes
i
will
see
him
he
has
not
been
here
already
no
sir
said
williams
will
you
have
a
hot
bath
sir
no
i
will
just
change
how
battered
the
poor
garden
will
look
tomorrow
after
this
deluge
taynton
changed
his
wet
clothes
and
half
an
hour
afterwards
he
sat
down
to
his
simple
and
excellent
supper
mrs
otter
had
provided
an
admirable
vegetable
soup
for
him
and
some
cold
lamb
with
asparagus
and
endive
salad
a
macedoine
of
strawberries
followed
and
a
scoop
of
cheese
simple
as
his
fare
was
it
just
suited
taynton
tastes
and
he
was
indulging
himself
with
the
rather
rare
luxury
of
a
third
glass
of
port
when
williams
entered
again
assheton
he
said
and
held
the
door
open
morris
came
in
he
was
dressed
in
evening
clothes
with
a
dinner
jacket
and
gave
no
salutation
to
his
host
he
not
come
yet
he
asked
but
his
host
sprang
up
dear
boy
he
said
what
a
relief
it
is
to
see
you
ever
since
you
left
this
afternoon
i
have
had
you
on
my
mind
you
will
have
a
glass
of
port
morris
laughed
a
curious
jangling
laugh
oh
yes
to
drink
his
health
he
said
he
sat
down
with
a
jerk
and
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
he
want
a
lot
of
health
to
carry
him
through
this
wo
he
he
asked
he
drank
his
glass
of
port
like
water
and
taynton
instantly
filled
it
up
again
for
him
ah
i
remember
you
do
like
port
he
said
what
else
can
i
offer
you
oh
this
will
do
very
well
said
morris
i
am
so
thirsty
you
have
dined
asked
his
host
quietly
no
i
do
think
i
did
i
was
hungry
the
cromwellian
clock
chimed
a
remnant
half
hour
said
morris
filling
his
glass
again
you
expect
him
then
do
you
mills
is
not
always
very
punctual
said
taynton
for
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
the
two
sat
with
hardly
the
interchange
of
a
word
from
outside
came
the
swift
steady
hiss
of
the
rain
on
to
the
shrubs
in
the
garden
and
again
the
clock
chimed
morris
who
at
first
had
sat
very
quiet
had
begun
to
fidget
and
stir
in
his
chair
occasionally
when
he
happened
to
notice
it
he
drank
off
the
port
with
which
taynton
hospitably
kept
his
glass
supplied
sometimes
he
relit
a
cigarette
only
to
let
it
go
out
again
but
when
the
clock
struck
he
got
up
i
wonder
what
has
happened
he
said
can
he
have
missed
his
train
what
time
ought
he
to
have
got
in
he
was
to
have
got
to
falmer
said
taynton
with
a
little
emphasis
on
the
last
word
at
a
quarter
to
seven
he
spoke
of
walking
from
there
morris
looked
at
him
with
a
furtive
sidelong
glance
why
i
i
might
have
met
him
there
he
said
i
went
up
there
again
after
i
left
you
to
tell
sir
richard
you
would
call
you
saw
nothing
of
him
asked
the
lawyer
no
of
course
not
otherwise
there
was
scarcely
a
soul
on
the
road
the
storm
was
coming
up
but
he
would
go
by
the
downs
would
he
not
the
path
over
the
downs
does
branch
off
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
falmer
station
said
taynton
the
minutes
ticked
on
till
ten
then
morris
went
to
the
door
i
shall
go
round
to
his
rooms
to
see
if
he
is
there
he
said
there
is
no
need
said
his
host
i
will
telephone
the
instrument
hung
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
with
very
little
delay
mills
servant
was
rung
up
his
master
had
not
yet
returned
but
he
had
said
that
he
should
very
likely
be
late
and
he
made
an
appointment
with
you
for
nine
asked
morris
again
yes
i
can
not
think
what
has
happened
to
detain
him
morris
went
quickly
to
the
door
again
i
believe
it
is
all
a
trick
he
said
and
you
do
want
me
to
meet
him
i
believe
he
is
in
his
rooms
the
whole
time
i
shall
go
and
see
before
taynton
could
stop
him
he
had
opened
the
and
banged
it
behind
him
and
was
off
hatless
and
coatless
through
the
pouring
perpendicular
rain
taynton
ran
to
the
door
as
if
to
stop
him
but
morris
was
already
halfway
down
the
street
and
he
went
upstairs
to
the
morris
was
altogether
unlike
himself
this
discovery
of
mills
treachery
seemed
to
have
changed
his
nature
violent
and
quick
he
always
was
but
he
was
suspicious
he
seemed
to
distrust
taynton
himself
and
a
thing
which
his
host
had
never
known
him
do
before
he
had
drunk
in
that
half
hour
when
they
sat
waiting
close
on
a
bottle
of
port
the
evening
paper
lay
ready
cut
for
him
in
its
accustomed
place
but
for
some
five
minutes
taynton
did
not
appear
to
notice
it
though
evening
papers
on
the
page
might
contain
news
so
frightfully
momentous
to
him
but
something
this
strangeness
in
morris
no
doubt
and
his
general
anxiety
and
suspense
as
to
how
this
dreadful
knot
could
unravel
itself
preoccupied
him
now
and
even
when
he
did
take
up
the
paper
and
turn
to
the
reports
of
stock
exchange
dealings
he
was
conscious
of
no
more
than
a
sort
of
subaqueous
thrill
of
satisfaction
for
boston
copper
had
gone
up
nearly
a
point
since
the
closing
price
of
last
night
it
was
not
many
minutes
however
before
morris
returned
with
matted
and
streaming
hair
and
drenched
clothes
he
has
not
come
back
he
said
i
went
to
his
rooms
and
satisfied
myself
of
that
though
i
think
they
thought
i
was
mad
i
searched
them
you
understand
i
insisted
i
shall
go
round
there
again
first
thing
morning
and
if
he
is
not
there
i
shall
go
up
to
find
him
in
town
i
ca
wait
i
simply
ca
wait
taynton
looked
at
him
gravely
then
nodded
no
i
guess
how
you
are
feeling
he
said
i
can
not
understand
what
has
happened
to
mills
i
hope
nothing
is
wrong
and
now
my
dear
boy
let
me
implore
you
to
go
straight
home
get
off
your
wet
things
and
go
to
bed
you
will
pay
heavily
for
your
excitement
if
you
are
not
careful
i
get
it
out
of
him
said
morris
chapter
vi
morris
as
taynton
had
advised
though
not
because
he
advised
it
had
gone
straight
home
to
the
house
in
sussex
square
he
had
stripped
off
his
dripping
clothes
and
then
since
this
was
the
line
of
least
resistance
he
had
gone
to
bed
he
did
not
feel
tired
and
he
longed
with
that
aching
longing
of
the
son
for
the
mother
that
assheton
had
been
here
so
that
he
could
just
be
in
her
presence
and
if
he
found
himself
unable
to
speak
and
tell
her
all
the
hideous
happenings
of
those
last
days
let
her
presence
bring
a
sort
of
healing
to
his
tortured
mind
but
though
he
was
conscious
of
no
tiredness
he
was
tired
to
the
point
of
exhaustion
and
he
had
hardly
got
into
bed
when
he
fell
fast
asleep
outside
hushing
him
to
rest
there
sounded
the
sibilant
rain
and
from
the
sea
below
ripples
broke
gently
and
rhythmically
on
the
pebbly
beach
nature
too
it
seemed
was
exhausted
by
that
convulsion
of
the
elements
that
had
turned
the
evening
into
a
clamorous
hell
of
fire
and
riot
and
now
from
very
weariness
she
was
weeping
herself
asleep
it
was
not
yet
eleven
when
morris
had
got
home
and
he
slept
dreamlessly
with
that
recuperative
sleep
of
youth
for
some
six
hours
then
as
within
the
secret
economy
of
the
brain
the
refreshment
of
slumber
repaired
the
exhaustion
of
the
day
before
he
began
to
dream
with
strange
lurid
distinctness
a
sort
of
resurrection
dream
of
which
the
events
of
the
two
days
before
supplied
the
bones
and
skeleton
outline
as
in
all
very
vivid
and
dreadful
dreams
the
whole
vision
was
connected
and
coherent
there
were
no
ludicrous
and
inconsequent
interludes
none
of
those
breakings
of
one
thread
and
hurried
seizures
of
another
which
though
one
is
dreaming
very
distinctly
supply
some
vague
mental
comfort
since
even
to
the
sleeper
they
are
reminders
that
his
experiences
are
not
solid
but
mere
phantasies
woven
by
imperfect
consciousness
and
incomplete
control
of
thought
it
was
not
thus
that
morris
dreamed
his
dream
was
of
the
solid
and
sober
texture
of
life
he
was
driving
in
his
motor
he
thought
down
the
road
from
the
house
at
falmer
park
which
through
the
gate
of
a
disused
lodge
joins
the
main
road
that
leads
from
falmer
station
to
brighton
he
had
just
heard
from
sir
richard
own
lips
who
it
was
who
had
slandered
and
blackened
him
but
in
his
dream
he
was
conscious
of
no
anger
the
case
had
been
referred
to
some
higher
power
some
august
court
of
supreme
authority
which
would
certainly
use
its
own
instruments
for
its
own
vengeance
he
felt
he
was
concerned
in
the
affair
no
longer
he
was
but
a
spectator
of
what
would
be
and
in
obedience
to
some
inward
dictation
he
drove
his
motor
on
to
the
grass
behind
the
lodge
so
that
it
was
concealed
from
the
road
outside
and
walked
along
the
inside
of
the
which
ran
parallel
with
it
the
afternoon
it
seemed
was
very
dark
though
the
atmosphere
was
extraordinarily
clear
and
after
walking
along
the
springy
grass
inside
the
railings
for
some
three
hundred
yards
where
was
the
southeastern
corner
of
the
park
enclosure
he
stopped
at
the
angle
and
standing
on
peered
over
them
for
they
were
nearly
six
feet
high
and
looked
into
the
road
below
it
ran
straight
as
a
just
here
and
was
visible
for
a
long
distance
but
at
the
corner
just
outside
the
palings
the
footpath
over
the
downs
to
brighton
left
the
road
and
struck
upward
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
ran
the
railway
and
in
this
clear
dark
air
morris
could
see
with
great
distinctness
falmer
station
some
four
hundred
yards
away
along
a
stretch
of
the
line
on
the
other
side
of
it
as
he
looked
he
saw
a
puff
of
steam
rise
against
the
woods
beyond
the
station
and
before
long
a
train
going
brightonward
clashed
into
the
station
only
one
passenger
got
out
and
he
came
out
of
the
station
into
the
road
he
was
quite
recognisable
even
at
this
distance
in
his
dream
morris
felt
that
he
expected
to
see
him
get
out
of
the
train
and
walk
along
the
road
the
whole
thing
seemed
but
he
ceased
tiptoeing
to
look
over
the
paling
he
could
hear
the
passenger
steps
when
he
came
nearer
he
thought
he
waited
quietly
squatting
down
on
the
mossy
grass
behind
the
paling
something
in
his
hands
seemed
angry
for
his
fingers
kept
tearing
up
the
short
turf
and
the
juice
of
the
severed
stems
was
red
like
blood
then
in
the
gathering
darkness
he
heard
the
of
footsteps
on
the
highway
but
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
this
passenger
would
continue
on
the
highroad
he
was
certainly
going
over
the
downs
to
brighton
the
air
was
quite
windless
but
at
this
moment
morris
heard
the
boughs
of
the
immediately
above
him
stir
and
shake
and
looking
up
he
saw
taynton
sitting
in
a
fork
of
the
tree
that
too
was
perfectly
natural
taynton
was
mills
partner
he
was
there
as
a
sort
of
umpire
he
held
a
glass
of
port
wine
in
one
hand
and
was
sipping
it
in
a
leisurely
manner
and
when
morris
looked
up
at
him
he
smiled
at
him
but
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
as
if
recommending
silence
and
as
the
steps
on
the
road
outside
sounded
close
he
turned
a
meaning
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
road
from
where
he
sat
high
in
the
tree
it
was
plain
to
morris
that
he
must
command
the
sight
of
the
road
and
was
in
his
friendly
manner
directing
operations
suddenly
the
sound
of
the
steps
ceased
and
morris
wondered
for
the
moment
whether
mills
had
stopped
but
looking
up
again
he
saw
taynton
head
twisted
round
to
the
right
still
looking
over
the
palings
but
morris
found
at
once
that
the
footsteps
were
noiseless
not
because
the
walker
had
paused
but
because
they
were
inaudible
on
the
grass
he
had
left
the
road
as
the
dreamer
felt
certain
he
would
and
was
going
over
the
downs
to
brighton
at
that
morris
got
up
and
still
inside
the
park
railings
followed
in
the
direction
he
had
gone
then
for
the
first
time
in
his
dream
he
felt
angry
and
the
anger
grew
to
rage
and
the
rage
to
quivering
madness
next
moment
he
had
vaulted
the
fence
and
sprang
upon
the
walker
from
behind
he
dealt
him
blows
with
some
hard
instrument
belabouring
his
head
while
with
his
left
hand
he
throttled
his
throat
so
that
he
could
not
scream
only
a
few
were
necessary
for
he
knew
that
each
blow
went
home
since
all
the
savage
youthful
strength
of
shoulder
and
loose
elbow
directed
them
then
he
withdrew
his
left
hand
from
the
throttled
throat
of
the
victim
who
had
ceased
to
struggle
and
like
a
log
he
fell
back
on
to
the
grass
and
morris
for
the
first
time
looked
on
his
face
it
was
not
mills
at
all
it
was
taynton
the
terror
plucked
him
from
his
sleep
for
a
moment
he
wrestled
and
struggled
to
raise
his
head
from
the
pillow
and
loosen
the
clutch
of
the
who
had
suddenly
seized
him
and
with
choking
throat
and
streaming
brow
he
sat
up
in
bed
even
then
his
dream
was
more
real
to
him
than
the
sight
of
his
own
familiar
room
more
real
than
the
touch
of
sheet
and
blanket
or
the
dew
of
anguish
which
his
own
hand
wiped
from
his
forehead
and
throat
yet
what
was
his
dream
was
it
merely
some
subconscious
stringing
together
of
suggestions
and
desires
and
events
vivified
in
sleep
to
a
coherent
story
all
but
that
recognition
of
taynton
which
was
nightmare
pure
and
simple
or
it
with
waking
anyhow
the
public
life
the
life
that
concerned
other
living
folk
as
well
as
himself
became
predominant
again
he
had
certainly
seen
sir
richard
the
day
before
and
sir
richard
had
given
him
the
name
of
the
man
who
had
slandered
him
he
had
gone
to
meet
that
man
but
he
had
not
kept
his
appointment
nor
had
he
come
back
to
his
flat
in
brighton
so
he
morris
was
going
to
call
there
once
more
and
if
he
did
not
find
him
was
going
to
drive
up
to
london
and
seek
him
there
but
he
had
been
effectually
plucked
from
further
sleep
sleep
had
been
strangled
and
he
got
out
of
bed
and
went
to
the
window
nature
in
any
case
had
swept
her
trouble
away
and
the
pure
sweet
morning
was
beginning
to
dawn
in
lines
of
yellow
and
fleeces
of
rosy
cloud
on
the
eastern
horizon
all
that
riot
and
of
thunder
the
bull
eye
flashing
of
lightning
the
perpendicular
rain
were
things
of
the
past
and
this
morning
a
sky
of
pale
limpid
blue
flecked
only
by
the
thinnest
clouds
stretched
from
horizon
to
horizon
below
the
mirror
of
the
sea
seemed
as
deep
and
as
placid
as
the
sky
above
it
and
the
inimitable
freshness
of
the
dawn
spoke
of
a
world
rejuvenated
and
renewed
it
was
by
his
watch
scarcely
five
in
an
hour
it
would
be
reasonable
to
call
at
mills
flat
and
see
if
he
had
come
by
the
midnight
train
if
not
his
motor
could
be
round
by
soon
after
six
and
he
would
be
in
town
by
eight
before
mills
if
he
had
slept
there
would
be
thinking
of
starting
for
brighton
he
was
sure
to
catch
him
morris
had
drawn
up
the
blind
and
through
the
open
window
came
the
cool
breath
of
the
morning
ruffling
his
hair
and
blowing
his
nightshirt
close
to
his
skin
and
just
for
that
moment
so
exquisite
was
this
feeling
of
renewal
and
cleanness
in
the
hour
of
dawn
he
thought
with
a
sort
of
incredulous
wonder
of
the
red
murderous
hate
which
had
possessed
him
the
evening
before
he
seemed
to
have
been
literally
beside
himself
with
anger
and
his
words
his
thoughts
his
actions
had
been
controlled
by
a
force
and
a
possession
which
was
outside
himself
also
the
dreadful
reality
of
his
dream
still
a
little
unnerved
him
and
though
he
was
himself
now
and
awake
he
felt
that
he
had
been
no
less
himself
when
he
throttled
the
throat
of
that
abhorred
figure
that
walked
up
the
noiseless
path
over
the
downs
to
brighton
and
with
vehement
and
savage
blows
clubbed
it
down
and
then
the
shock
of
finding
it
was
his
old
friend
whom
he
had
done
to
death
that
it
is
true
was
nightmare
pure
and
simple
but
all
the
rest
was
clad
in
sober
convincing
garb
of
events
that
had
really
taken
place
he
could
not
at
once
separate
his
dream
from
reality
for
indeed
what
had
he
done
yesterday
after
he
had
learned
who
his
traducer
had
been
he
scarcely
knew
all
events
and
facts
seemed
colourless
compared
to
the
rage
and
mad
lust
for
vengeance
which
had
occupied
his
entire
consciousness
thus
as
he
dressed
the
thoughts
and
the
rage
of
yesterday
began
to
stir
and
move
in
his
mind
again
his
hate
and
his
desire
that
justice
should
be
done
that
satisfaction
should
be
granted
him
was
still
in
his
heart
but
now
they
were
not
wild
and
flashing
flames
they
burned
with
a
hard
cold
even
light
they
were
already
part
of
himself
integral
pieces
and
features
of
his
soul
and
the
calm
beauty
and
peace
of
the
morning
ceased
to
touch
him
he
had
a
stern
piece
of
business
to
put
through
before
he
could
think
of
anything
else
it
was
not
yet
six
when
he
arrived
at
the
house
in
which
was
flat
a
few
housemaids
were
about
but
the
lift
was
not
yet
working
and
he
ran
upstairs
and
rang
at
the
bell
it
was
answered
almost
immediately
for
mills
servant
supposed
it
must
be
his
master
arriving
at
this
early
hour
since
no
one
else
would
come
then
and
he
opened
the
door
half
dressed
with
coat
and
trousers
only
put
over
his
night
things
is
mills
back
yet
asked
morris
no
sir
morris
turned
to
go
but
then
stopped
his
mind
still
that
he
had
been
warned
by
his
partner
and
was
lying
i
give
you
another
ten
shillings
he
said
if
you
let
me
come
in
and
satisfy
myself
the
man
hesitated
a
sovereign
said
morris
he
went
back
to
sussex
square
after
this
roused
martin
ordering
him
to
bring
the
motor
round
at
once
and
drank
a
cup
of
tea
for
he
would
breakfast
in
town
his
mother
he
expected
would
be
back
during
the
morning
and
at
the
thought
of
her
he
remembered
that
this
was
june
her
birthday
and
that
his
present
to
her
would
be
arriving
by
the
early
post
he
gave
orders
therefore
that
a
packet
for
him
from
asprey
was
not
to
be
unpacked
but
given
to
her
on
her
arrival
with
her
letters
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
was
off
leaving
martin
behind
since
there
were
various
businesses
in
the
town
which
he
wanted
him
to
attend
to
taynton
though
an
earlier
riser
than
his
partner
considered
that
half
past
nine
was
soon
enough
to
begin
the
day
and
punctually
at
that
time
he
came
downstairs
to
read
as
his
custom
was
a
few
collects
and
some
short
piece
of
the
bible
to
his
servants
before
having
his
breakfast
that
little
ceremony
over
he
walked
for
a
few
minutes
in
his
garden
while
williams
brought
in
his
toast
and
and
observed
that
though
the
flowers
would
no
doubt
be
all
the
better
for
the
liberal
watering
of
the
day
before
it
was
idle
to
deny
that
the
rain
had
not
considerably
damaged
them
but
his
attention
was
turned
from
these
things
to
williams
who
told
him
that
breakfast
was
ready
and
also
brought
him
a
telegram
it
was
from
morris
and
had
been
sent
off
from
the
sloane
square
office
an
hour
before
mills
is
not
in
town
they
say
he
left
yesterday
afternoon
please
inform
me
if
you
know
whether
this
is
so
or
if
you
are
keeping
him
from
me
am
delayed
by
shall
be
back
about
morris
bachelors
club
taynton
read
this
through
twice
as
is
the
habit
of
most
people
with
telegrams
and
sent
of
course
the
reply
that
all
he
knew
was
that
his
partner
intended
to
come
back
last
night
since
he
had
made
an
appointment
with
him
should
he
arrive
during
the
day
he
would
telegraph
he
himself
was
keeping
nothing
from
morris
and
had
not
had
any
correspondence
or
communication
with
his
partner
since
he
had
left
brighton
for
town
three
days
before
the
telegram
was
a
long
one
but
taynton
still
sat
with
poised
pen
then
he
added
pray
do
nothing
violent
i
implore
you
and
he
signed
it
he
sat
rather
unusually
long
over
his
breakfast
this
morning
though
he
ate
but
little
and
from
the
cheerful
smiling
aspect
of
his
face
it
would
seem
that
his
thoughts
were
pleasant
to
him
he
was
certainly
glad
that
morris
had
not
yet
come
across
mills
for
he
trusted
that
the
lapse
of
a
day
or
two
would
speedily
calm
down
the
lad
perfectly
justifiable
indignation
besides
he
was
in
love
and
his
suit
had
prospered
surely
there
were
pleasanter
things
than
revenge
to
occupy
him
then
his
face
grew
grave
a
moment
as
he
thought
of
morris
mad
murderous
outburst
of
the
evening
before
but
that
gravity
was
shortlived
and
he
turned
with
a
sense
of
pleasant
expectation
to
see
recorded
again
the
activity
and
strength
of
boston
coppers
but
the
reality
was
far
beyond
his
expectations
copper
had
been
strong
all
day
and
in
the
street
afterward
there
had
been
renewed
buying
from
quarters
which
were
usually
well
informed
bostons
had
been
much
in
request
and
after
hours
they
had
had
a
further
spurt
closing
at
already
in
these
three
days
he
had
cleared
his
option
and
at
present
prices
the
shares
showed
a
profit
of
a
point
mills
would
have
to
acknowledge
that
his
perspicacity
had
been
at
fault
when
he
distrusted
this
last
purchase
he
left
his
house
at
about
ten
and
again
immured
himself
in
the
birdcage
lift
that
carried
him
up
to
his
partner
flat
where
he
inquired
if
he
had
yet
returned
learning
he
had
not
he
asked
to
be
given
pen
and
paper
to
write
a
note
for
him
which
was
to
be
given
to
him
on
his
arrival
dear
mills
morris
assheton
has
learned
that
you
have
made
grave
accusations
about
him
to
sir
richard
templeton
bart
that
you
have
done
so
appears
to
be
beyond
doubt
and
it
of
course
rests
with
you
to
substantiate
them
i
can
not
of
course
at
present
believe
that
you
could
have
done
so
without
conclusive
evidence
on
the
other
hand
i
can
not
believe
that
assheton
is
of
the
character
which
you
have
given
him
i
therefore
refrain
as
far
as
i
am
able
from
drawing
any
conclusion
till
the
matter
is
cleared
up
i
may
add
that
he
deeply
resents
your
conduct
his
anger
and
indignation
were
terrible
to
see
sincerely
yours
edward
taynton
godfrey
mills
esq
taynton
read
this
through
and
glanced
round
as
if
to
see
whether
the
servants
had
left
the
room
then
he
sat
with
closed
eyes
for
a
moment
and
took
an
envelope
and
swiftly
addressed
it
he
smudged
it
however
in
blotting
it
and
so
crumpled
it
up
threw
it
into
the
basket
he
then
addressed
a
second
one
and
into
this
he
inserted
his
letter
and
got
up
the
servant
was
waiting
in
the
little
hall
outside
please
give
this
to
mills
when
he
arrives
he
said
you
expected
him
last
night
did
you
not
taynton
found
on
arrival
at
his
office
that
in
his
absence
there
was
a
somewhat
heavy
day
of
work
before
him
and
foresaw
that
he
would
be
occupied
all
afternoon
and
indeed
probably
up
to
dinner
time
but
he
was
able
to
get
out
for
an
hour
at
twelve
at
which
time
if
the
weather
was
hot
he
generally
indulged
in
a
swim
but
today
there
was
a
certain
chill
in
the
air
after
yesterday
storm
and
instead
of
taking
his
dip
he
walked
along
the
sea
front
toward
sussex
square
for
in
his
way
seeing
that
morris
was
as
he
had
said
to
tell
his
mother
today
about
his
happy
and
thoroughly
suitable
love
affair
taynton
proposed
to
give
a
little
on
the
earliest
possible
evening
at
which
the
two
young
lovers
assheton
and
himself
would
form
the
table
he
would
learn
from
her
what
was
the
earliest
night
on
which
she
and
morris
were
disengaged
and
then
write
to
that
delightful
girl
whose
affections
dear
morris
had
captured
but
at
the
corner
of
the
square
just
as
he
was
turning
into
it
there
bowled
swiftly
out
a
victoria
drawn
by
two
horses
he
recognised
the
equipage
he
recognised
also
assheton
who
was
sitting
in
it
her
head
however
was
turned
the
other
way
and
taynton
hand
already
up
to
his
hat
was
spared
the
trouble
of
journeying
farther
but
he
went
on
to
the
house
since
his
invitation
could
be
easily
conveyed
by
a
note
which
he
would
scribble
there
and
was
admitted
by
martin
assheton
however
was
out
a
fact
which
he
learned
with
regret
but
if
he
might
write
a
note
to
her
his
walk
would
not
be
wasted
accordingly
he
was
shown
up
into
the
where
on
the
was
laid
an
open
even
in
so
small
a
detail
as
a
the
careful
appointment
of
the
house
was
evident
for
the
was
absolutely
clean
and
white
a
virgin
field
taynton
took
up
a
quill
pen
thought
over
for
a
moment
the
wording
of
his
note
and
then
wrote
rapidly
a
single
side
of
notepaper
was
sufficient
he
blotted
it
on
the
pad
and
read
it
through
but
something
in
it
it
must
be
supposed
did
not
satisfy
him
for
he
crumpled
it
up
ah
at
last
and
for
the
first
time
there
was
a
flaw
in
the
appointment
of
the
house
for
there
was
no
wastepaper
basket
by
the
table
at
any
rate
one
must
suppose
that
taynton
did
not
see
it
for
he
put
his
rejected
sheet
into
his
pocket
he
took
another
sheet
of
paper
selecting
from
the
various
stationery
that
stood
in
the
case
a
plain
piece
rejecting
that
which
was
marked
with
the
address
of
the
house
wrote
his
own
address
at
the
head
and
proceeded
for
the
second
time
to
write
his
note
of
invitation
but
first
he
changed
the
quill
for
his
own
stylograph
and
wrote
with
that
this
was
soon
written
and
by
the
time
he
had
read
it
through
it
was
dry
and
did
not
require
to
be
blotted
he
placed
it
in
a
plain
envelope
directed
it
and
with
it
in
his
hand
left
the
room
and
went
briskly
downstairs
martin
was
standing
in
the
hall
i
want
this
given
to
assheton
when
she
comes
in
martin
he
said
he
looked
round
as
he
had
done
once
before
when
speaking
to
the
boy
i
left
it
at
the
door
he
said
with
quiet
emphasis
can
you
remember
that
i
left
it
and

at
the
door
thank

hat

and
my
stick
taynton
went
straight
back
to
his
office
and
though
this
morning
there
had
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
good
deal
of
work
to
be
got
through
he
found
that
much
of
it
could
be
delegated
to
his
clerks
so
before
leaving
to
go
to
his
lunch
he
called
in
timmins
mills
not
been
here
all
morning
he
asked
no
well
timmins
there
is
this
packet
which
i
want
him

look
at
if
he
comes
in
before
i
am

is

hour

is
all
thanks
please

mills

rain
the
shining
after
rain
wonderful
words
yes
timmins
you
will
find
the
verse
in
the
second
book
of
samuel
and
the
chapter
chapter
vii
taynton
made
but
a
short
meal
of
lunch
and
ate
but
sparingly
for
he
meant
to
take
a
good
walk
this
afternoon
and
it
was
not
yet
two
when
he
came
out
of
his
house
again
stick
in
hand
it
was
a
large
heavy
stick
that
he
carried
a
veritable
club
one
that
it
would
be
easy
to
recognise
amid
a
host
of
others
even
as
he
had
recognised
it
that
morning
in
the
rather
populous
umbrella
stand
in
the
hall
of
assheton
house
he
had
it
may
be
remembered
more
office
work
to
get
through
before
evening
so
he
prepared
to
walk
out
as
far
as
the
limits
of
the
time
at
his
disposal
would
admit
and
take
the
train
back
and
since
there
could
be
nothing
more
pleasurable
in
the
way
of
walking
than
locomotion
over
the
springy
grass
of
the
downs
he
took
as
he
had
done
a
hundred
times
before
the
road
that
led
to
falmer
a
hundred
yards
out
of
brighton
there
was
a
stile
by
the
roadside
from
there
a
footpath
if
it
could
be
dignified
by
the
name
of
path
at
all
led
over
the
hills
to
a
corner
of
falmer
park
from
there
three
or
four
hundred
yards
of
highway
would
bring
him
to
the
station
he
would
be
in
good
time
to
catch
the
train
back
and
would
thus
be
at
his
office
again
for
an
hour
work
at
five
his
walk
was
solitary
and
uneventful
but
to
one
of
so
delicate
and
sensitive
a
mind
full
of
tiny
but
memorable
sights
and
sounds
up
on
these
high
lands
there
was
a
considerable
breeze
and
taynton
paused
for
a
minute
or
two
beside
a
windmill
that
stood
alone
in
the
expanse
of
down
watching
with
a
sort
of
boyish
wonder
the
huge
flails
swing
down
and
aspire
again
in
the
circles
of
their
tireless
toil
a
little
farther
on
was
a
tumulus
of
saxon
times
and
his
mind
was
distracted
from
the
present
to
those
early
days
when
the
unknown
dead
was
committed
to
this
tomb
forests
of
pine
no
doubt
then
grew
around
his
resting
place
it
was
beneath
the
gloom
and
murmur
of
their
sable
foliage
that
this
dead
chief
was
entrusted
to
the
keeping
of
the
kindly
earth
he
passed
too
over
the
lines
of
a
roman
camp
once
this
sunny
empty
down
to
the
clang
of
arms
the
voices
of
the
living
were
mingled
with
the
cries
and
groans
of
the
dying
for
without
doubt
this
stronghold
of
roman
arms
was
not
won
standing
as
it
did
on
the
commanding
slope
of
the
hills
without
slaughter
yet
the
peaceful
clumps
of
cistus
and
the
trembling
harebell
blossomed
on
the
battlefield
from
this
point
the
ground
declined
swiftly
to
the
main
road
straight
in
front
of
him
were
the
palings
of
falmer
park
and
the
tenantless
down
with
its
long
smooth
curves
was
broken
up
into
sudden
hillocks
and
depressions
dells
and
dingles
some
green
with
bracken
others
half
full
of
water
lay
to
right
and
left
of
the
path
which
as
it
approached
the
corner
of
the
park
was
more
strongly
marked
than
when
it
lay
over
the
big
open
spaces
it
was
somewhat
slippery
too
after
the
torrent
of
yesterday
and
taynton
stick
saved
him
more
than
once
from
slipping
but
before
he
got
down
to
the
point
where
the
corner
of
the
park
abutted
on
the
main
road
he
had
leaned
on
it
too
heavily
and
for
all
its
seeming
strength
it
had
broken
in
the
middle
the
two
pieces
were
but
luggage
to
him
and
just
as
he
came
to
the
road
he
threw
them
away
into
a
wooded
hollow
that
adjoined
the
path
the
stick
had
broken
straight
across
it
was
no
use
to
think
of
having
it
mended
he
was
out
of
the
wind
here
and
since
there
was
still
some
ten
minutes
to
spare
he
sat
down
on
the
grassy
edge
of
the
road
to
smoke
a
cigarette
the
woods
of
the
park
basked
in
the
fresh
sunshine
three
hundred
yards
away
was
falmer
station
and
beyond
that
the
line
was
visible
for
a
mile
as
it
ran
up
the
straight
valley
indeed
he
need
hardly
move
till
he
saw
the
steam
of
his
train
on
the
limit
of
the
horizon
that
would
be
ample
warning
that
it
was
time
to
go
then
from
far
away
he
heard
the
throbbing
of
a
motor
which
grew
suddenly
louder
as
it
turned
the
corner
of
the
road
by
the
station
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
going
very
fast
and
the
huge
cloud
of
dust
behind
it
endorsed
his
impression
but
almost
immediately
after
passing
this
corner
it
began
to
slow
down
and
the
cloud
of
dust
behind
it
died
away
at
the
edge
of
the
road
where
taynton
sat
there
were
standing
several
thick
bushes
he
moved
a
little
away
from
the
road
and
took
up
his
seat
again
behind
one
of
them
the
car
came
very
slowly
on
and
stopped
just
opposite
him
on
his
right
lay
the
hollow
where
he
had
thrown
the
useless
halves
of
his
stick
on
his
left
was
the
corner
of
the
falmer
park
railings
he
had
recognised
the
driver
of
the
car
who
was
alone
morris
got
out
when
he
had
stopped
the
car
and
then
spoke
aloud
though
to
himself
yes
there
the
corner
he
said
there
the
path
over
the
downs
there
taynton
got
up
and
came
toward
him
my
dear
fellow
he
said
i
have
walked
out
from
brighton
on
this
divine
afternoon
and
was
going
to
take
the
train
back
but
will
you
give
me
the
pleasure
of
driving
back
with
you
instead
morris
looked
at
him
a
moment
as
if
he
hardly
thought
he
was
real
why
of
course
he
said
taynton
was
all
beams
and
smiles
and
you
have
seen
mills
he
asked
you
have
been
convinced
that
he
was
innocent
of
the
terrible
suspicion
morris
my
dear
boy
what
is
the
matter
morris
had
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
with
incredulous
eyes
then
he
had
sat
down
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
it
nothing
he
said
at
length
i
felt
rather
faint
i
shall
be
better
in
a
minute
of
course
i
drive
you
back
he
sat
huddled
up
with
hidden
face
for
a
moment
or
two
taynton
said
nothing
but
only
looked
at
him
then
the
boy
sat
up
i
all
right
he
said
it
was
just
a
dream
i
had
last
night
no
i
have
not
seen
mills
they
tell
me
he
left
yesterday
afternoon
for
brighton
shall
we
go
for
some
little
distance
they
went
in
silence
then
it
seemed
that
morris
made
an
effort
and
spoke
really
i
got
what
they
call
a
turn
just
now
he
said
i
had
a
curiously
vivid
dream
last
night
about
that
corner
and
you
suddenly
appeared
in
my
dream
quite
unexpectedly
as
you
did
just
now
and
what
was
this
dream
asked
taynton
turning
up
his
coat
collar
for
the
wind
of
their
movement
blew
rather
shrilly
on
to
his
neck
oh
nothing
particular
said
morris
carelessly
the
vividness
was
concerned
with
your
appearance
that
was
what
startled
me
then
he
fell
back
into
the
train
of
thought
that
had
occupied
him
all
the
way
down
from
london
i
believe
i
was
with
rage
last
night
he
said
at
length
but
this
afternoon
i
think
i
am
beginning
to
be
sane
again
it
true
mills
tried
to
injure
me
but
he
did
succeed
and
as
you
said
last
night
i
have
too
deep
and
intense
a
cause
of
happiness
to
give
my
thoughts
and
energies
to
anything
so
futile
as
hatred
or
the
desire
for
revenge
he
is
punished
already
the
fact
of
his
having
tried
to
injure
me
like
that
was
his
punishment
anyhow
i
am
sick
and
tired
of
my
anger
the
lawyer
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
and
when
he
did
his
voice
was
trembling
god
bless
you
my
dear
boy
he
said
gently
morris
devoted
himself
for
some
little
time
to
the
guiding
of
the
car
and
i
want
you
also
to
leave
it
all
alone
he
said
after
a
while
i
do
want
you
to
dissolve
your
partnership
with
him
or
whatever
you
call
it
i
suppose
he
will
guess
that
you
know
all
about
it
so
perhaps
it
would
be
best
if
you
told
him
straight
out
that
you
do
and
then
you
can
well
make
a
few
remarks
you
know
and
drop
the
whole
damned
subject
forever
taynton
seemed
much
moved
i
will
try
he
said
since
you
ask
it
but
morris
you
are
more
generous
than
i
am
morris
laughed
his
usual
boyish
high
spirits
and
simplicity
were
reasserting
themselves
again
oh
that
all
rot
he
said
it
only
because
it
so
fearfully
tiring
to
go
on
being
angry
but
i
ca
help
wondering
what
has
happened
to
the
fellow
they
told
me
at
his
flat
in
town
that
he
went
off
with
his
luggage
yesterday
afternoon
and
gave
orders
that
all
letters
were
to
be
sent
to
his
brighton
address
you
do
think
there
anything
wrong
do
you
my
dear
fellow
what
could
be
wrong
asked
taynton
he
had
some
business
to
do
at
lewes
on
his
way
down
and
i
make
no
doubt
he
slept
there
probably
forgetting
all
about
his
appointment
with
me
i
would
wager
you
that
we
shall
find
he
is
in
brighton
when
we
get
in
i
take
that
said
morris
half
a
crown
no
no
my
usual
shilling
my
usual
shilling
laughed
the
other
morris
set
taynton
down
at
his
office
and
by
way
of
settling
their
wager
at
once
waited
at
the
door
while
the
other
went
upstairs
to
see
if
his
partner
was
there
he
had
not
however
appeared
there
that
day
and
taynton
sent
a
clerk
down
to
morris
to
ask
him
to
come
up
and
they
would
ring
up
mills
flat
on
the
telephone
this
was
done
and
before
many
seconds
had
elapsed
they
were
in
communication
his
valet
was
there
still
waiting
for
his
return
for
he
had
not
yet
come
back
it
appeared
that
he
was
getting
rather
anxious
for
taynton
reassured
him
there
is
not
the
slightest
cause
for
any
anxiety
were
his
concluding
words
i
feel
convinced
he
has
merely
been
detained
thanks
that
all
please
let
me
know
as
soon
as
he
returns
he
drew
a
shilling
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
morris
but
his
face
in
spite
of
his
reassuring
words
was
a
little
troubled
you
would
have
said
that
though
he
might
not
yet
be
anxious
he
saw
that
there
was
some
possibility
of
his
being
so
before
very
long
yet
he
spoke
gaily
enough
and
i
made
so
sure
i
should
win
he
said
i
shall
put
it
down
to
unexpected
losses
not
connected
with
business
eh
timmins
or
shall
it
be
charity
it
would
never
do
to
put
down
losses
but
this
was
plainly
a
little
forced
and
morris
waited
till
timmins
had
gone
out
and
you
really
meant
that
he
asked
you
are
really
not
anxious
no
i
am
not
anxious
he
said
but
but
i
shall
be
glad
when
he
comes
back
is
that
inconsistent
i
think
perhaps
it
is
well
let
us
say
then
that
i
am
just
a
shade
anxious
but
i
may
add
that
i
feel
sure
my
anxiety
is
quite
unnecessary
that
defines
it
for
you
morris
went
straight
home
from
here
and
found
that
his
mother
had
just
returned
from
her
afternoon
drive
she
had
found
the
blotting
book
waiting
for
her
when
she
came
back
that
morning
and
was
delighted
with
the
gift
and
the
loving
remembering
thought
that
inspired
it
but
you
should
spend
your
money
on
me
my
darling
she
said
to
morris
though
i
just
love
the
impulse
that
made
you
oh
very
well
said
morris
kissing
her
let
have
the
initials
changed
about
then
and
let
it
be
from
then
his
voice
grew
grave
mother
dear
i
got
another
birthday
present
for
you
i
think
i
think
you
will
like
it
she
saw
at
once
that
he
was
speaking
of
no
tangible
material
gift
yes
dear
she
said
madge
and
me
said
morris
just
that
and
assheton
did
like
this
second
present
and
though
it
made
her
cry
a
little
her
tears
were
the
sweetest
that
can
be
shed
mother
and
son
dined
alone
together
and
since
morris
had
determined
to
forget
to
put
out
of
his
mind
the
hideous
injury
that
mills
had
attempted
to
do
him
he
judged
it
to
be
more
consistent
with
this
resolve
to
tell
his
mother
nothing
about
it
since
to
mention
it
to
another
even
to
her
implied
that
he
was
not
doing
his
best
to
bury
what
he
determined
should
be
dead
to
him
as
usual
they
played
backgammon
together
and
it
was
not
till
assheton
rose
to
go
to
bed
that
she
remembered
taynton
note
asking
her
and
morris
to
dine
with
him
on
their
earliest
unoccupied
day
this
as
is
the
way
in
the
country
happened
to
be
the
next
evening
and
since
the
last
post
had
already
gone
out
she
asked
morris
if
martin
might
take
the
note
round
for
her
tonight
since
it
ought
to
have
been
answered
before
that
of
course
was
easily
done
and
morris
told
his
servant
to
call
also
at
the
house
where
mills
flat
was
situated
and
ask
the
porter
if
he
had
come
home
the
note
dispatched
his
mother
went
to
bed
and
morris
went
down
to
the
billiard
room
to
practise
a
form
of
hazard
at
which
he
was
singularly
inefficient
and
wait
for
news
little
as
he
knew
mills
and
little
cause
as
he
had
for
liking
him
he
too
like
taynton
felt
vaguely
anxious
and
perturbed
since
disappearances
are
necessarily
hedged
about
with
mystery
and
wondering
his
own
anger
and
hatred
too
like
mists
drawn
up
and
dispersed
by
the
sun
of
love
that
had
dawned
on
him
had
altogether
vanished
the
attempt
against
him
had
as
it
turned
out
been
so
futile
and
he
genuinely
wished
to
have
some
assurance
of
the
safety
of
the
man
the
thought
of
whom
had
so
blackened
his
soul
only
hours
ago
his
errands
took
martin
the
best
part
of
an
hour
and
he
returned
with
two
notes
one
for
assheton
the
other
for
morris
he
had
been
also
to
the
flat
and
inquired
but
there
was
no
news
of
the
missing
man
morris
opened
his
note
which
was
from
taynton
dear
morris
i
am
delighted
that
your
mother
and
you
can
dine
and
i
am
telegraphing
first
thing
in
the
morning
to
see
if
miss
madge
will
make
our
fourth
i
feel
sure
that
when
she
knows
what
my
little
party
is
she
will
come
i
have
been
twice
round
to
see
if
my
partner
has
returned
and
find
no
news
of
him
it
is
idle
to
deny
that
i
am
getting
anxious
as
i
can
not
conceive
what
has
happened
should
he
not
be
back
by
tomorrow
morning
i
shall
put
the
matter
into
the
hands
of
the
police
i
trust
that
my
anxieties
are
unfounded
but
the
matter
is
beginning
to
look
strange
affectionately
yours
edward
taynton
there
is
nothing
so
infectious
as
anxiety
and
it
can
be
conveyed
by
look
or
word
or
letter
and
requires
no
period
of
incubation
and
morris
began
to
be
really
anxious
also
with
a
vague
disquietude
at
the
sense
of
there
being
something
wrong
chapter
viii
taynton
according
to
the
intention
he
had
expressed
sent
round
early
next
morning
the
day
of
the
week
being
saturday
to
his
flat
and
finding
that
he
was
not
there
and
that
no
word
of
any
kind
had
been
received
from
him
went
as
he
felt
himself
now
bound
to
do
to
the
police
office
stated
what
had
brought
him
there
and
gave
them
all
information
which
it
was
in
his
power
to
give
it
was
brief
enough
his
partner
had
gone
up
to
town
on
tuesday
last
and
had
he
followed
his
plans
should
have
returned
to
brighton
by
thursday
evening
since
he
had
made
an
appointment
to
come
to
taynton
house
at
nine
thirty
that
night
it
had
been
ascertained
too
by
taynton
hesitated
a
moment
by
morris
assheton
in
london
that
he
had
left
his
flat
in
james
court
on
thursday
afternoon
to
go
presumably
to
catch
the
train
back
to
brighton
he
had
also
left
orders
that
all
letters
should
be
forwarded
to
him
at
his
brighton
address
superintendent
figgis
to
whom
taynton
made
his
statement
was
in
manner
slow
stout
and
bored
and
looked
in
every
way
utterly
unfitted
to
find
clues
to
the
least
mysterious
occurrences
unearth
crime
or
run
down
the
criminal
he
seemed
quite
incapable
of
running
down
anything
and
taynton
had
to
repeat
everything
he
said
in
order
to
be
sure
that
figgis
got
his
notes
which
he
made
in
a
large
round
hand
with
laborious
distinctness
correctly
written
having
finished
them
the
superintendent
stared
at
them
mournfully
for
a
little
while
and
asked
taynton
if
he
had
anything
more
to
add
i
think
that
is
all
said
the
lawyer
ah
one
moment
mills
expressed
to
me
the
intention
of
perhaps
getting
out
at
falmer
and
walking
over
the
downs
to
brighton
but
thursday
was
the
evening
on
which
we
had
that
terrible
thunderstorm
i
should
think
it
very
unlikely
that
he
would
have
left
the
train
superintendent
figgis
appeared
to
be
trying
to
recollect
something
was
there
a
thunderstorm
on
thursday
he
asked
the
most
severe
i
ever
remember
said
taynton
it
had
slipped
my
memory
said
this
incompetent
agent
of
justice
but
a
little
thought
enabled
him
to
ask
a
question
that
bore
on
the
case
he
travelled
then
by
lewes
and
not
by
the
direct
route
presumably
he
had
a
season
ticket
via
lewes
since
our
business
often
took
him
there
had
he
intended
to
travel
by
hayward
heath
said
taynton
rather
laboriously
as
if
explaining
something
to
a
child
he
could
not
have
intended
to
get
out
at
falmer
figgis
had
to
think
over
this
which
he
did
with
his
mouth
open
seeing
that
the
hayward
heath
line
does
not
pass
falmer
he
suggested
taynton
drew
a
sheet
of
paper
toward
him
and
kindly
made
a
rough
of
railway
lines
and
his
season
ticket
went
by
the
lewes
line
he
explained
superintendent
figgis
appeared
to
understand
this
after
a
while
then
he
sighed
heavily
and
changed
the
subject
with
rather
disconcerting
abruptness
from
my
notes
i
understand
that
morris
assheton
ascertained
that
the
missing
individual
had
left
his
flat
in
london
on
thursday
afternoon
he
said
yes
assheton
is
a
client
of
ours
and
he
wished
to
see
my
partner
on
a
business
matter
in
fact
when
mills
was
found
not
to
have
returned
on
thursday
evening
he
went
up
to
london
next
day
to
see
him
since
we
both
supposed
he
had
been
detained
there
figgis
looked
once
more
mournfully
at
his
notes
altered
a
palpably
mistaken
wednesday
into
thursday
and
got
up
the
matter
shall
be
gone
into
he
said
taynton
went
straight
from
here
to
his
office
and
for
a
couple
of
hours
devoted
himself
to
the
business
of
his
firm
giving
it
his
whole
attention
and
working
perhaps
with
more
speed
than
it
was
usually
his
to
command
saturday
of
course
was
a
and
it
was
naturally
his
desire
to
get
cleared
off
everything
that
would
otherwise
interrupt
the
repose
and
security
from
business
affairs
which
was
to
him
the
proper
atmosphere
of
the
seventh
or
as
he
called
it
the
first
day
this
interview
with
the
accredited
representative
of
the
law
also
had
removed
a
certain
weight
from
his
mind
he
had
placed
the
matter
of
his
partner
disappearance
in
official
hands
he
had
done
all
he
could
do
to
clear
up
his
absence
and
in
case
but
here
he
pulled
himself
up
it
was
at
present
most
premature
even
to
look
at
the
possibility
of
crime
having
been
committed
taynton
was
in
no
way
a
vain
man
nor
was
it
his
habit
ever
to
review
his
own
conduct
with
the
object
of
contrasting
it
favourably
with
what
others
might
have
done
under
the
circumstances
yet
he
could
not
help
being
aware
that
others
less
kindly
than
he
would
have
shrugged
sarcastic
shoulders
and
said
probably
another
blackmailing
errand
has
detained
him
for
indeed
mills
had
painted
himself
in
very
ugly
colours
in
his
last
interview
with
him
that
horrid
hint
of
blackmail
which
still
so
to
speak
held
good
had
cast
a
new
light
on
him
but
now
taynton
was
conscious
of
no
grudge
against
him
he
did
not
say
he
can
look
after
himself
he
was
anxious
about
his
continued
absence
and
had
taken
the
extreme
step
of
calling
in
the
aid
of
the
police
the
national
guardian
of
personal
safety
he
got
away
from
his
office
about
twelve
and
in
preparation
for
the
little
dinner
festival
of
this
evening
for
miss
templeton
had
sent
her
joyful
telegraphic
acceptance
went
to
several
shops
to
order
some
few
little
delicacies
to
grace
his
plain
bachelor
table
an
for
instance
was
outside
the
orbit
so
he
feared
of
his
plain
though
excellent
cook
and
two
little
dishes
of
chocolates
and
sweets
since
he
was
at
the
confectioner
would
be
appropriate
to
the
taste
of
his
lady
guests
again
a
floral
decoration
of
the
table
was
indicated
and
since
the
storm
of
thursday
there
was
nothing
in
his
garden
worthy
of
the
occasion
thus
a
visit
to
the
florist
resulted
in
an
order
for
smilax
and
roses
he
got
home
however
at
his
usual
luncheon
hour
to
find
a
telegram
waiting
for
him
on
the
heppelwhite
table
in
the
hall
there
had
been
a
continued
buying
of
copper
shares
and
the
feature
was
a
sensational
rise
in
bostons
which
during
the
morning
had
gone
up
a
clear
point
taynton
had
no
need
to
make
calculations
he
knew
as
a
man
knows
the
multiplication
table
of
two
what
every
fraction
of
a
rise
in
bostons
meant
to
him
and
this
provided
only
he
had
time
to
sell
at
once
meant
the
complete
recovery
of
the
losses
he
had
suffered
with
those
active
markets
it
was
still
easily
possible
though
it
was
saturday
to
effect
his
sale
since
there
was
sure
to
be
long
continued
business
in
the
street
and
he
had
but
to
be
able
to
exercise
his
option
at
that
price
to
be
quit
of
that
dreadful
incubus
of
anxiety
which
for
the
last
two
years
had
been
a
millstone
round
his
neck
that
had
grown
mushroom
like
the
telephone
to
town
of
course
was
far
the
quickest
mode
of
communication
and
having
given
his
order
he
waited
ten
minutes
till
the
tube
babbled
and
croaked
to
him
again
there
is
a
saying
that
things
are
too
good
to
be
true
but
when
taynton
sat
down
to
his
lunch
that
day
he
felt
that
the
converse
of
the
proverb
was
the
correcter
epigram
things
could
be
so
good
that
they
must
be
true
and
here
still
ringing
in
his
ears
was
one
of
them
morris
it
was
thus
he
phrased
it
to
himself
was
paid
off
or
in
more
language
the
fortune
of
which
taynton
was
trustee
was
intact
again
and
like
a
for
a
good
child
there
was
an
additional
five
or
six
hundred
pounds
for
him
who
had
managed
the
trust
so
well
taynton
could
not
help
feeling
somehow
that
he
deserved
it
he
had
increased
morris
fortune
since
he
had
charge
of
it
by
and
what
a
lesson
too
he
had
had
so
gently
and
painlessly
taught
him
no
one
knew
better
than
he
how
grievously
wrong
he
had
got
in
gambling
with
trust
money
yet
now
it
had
come
right
he
had
repaired
the
original
wrong
on
monday
he
would
reinvest
this
capital
in
those
holdings
which
he
had
sold
and
morris
so
largely
the
result
of
careful
and
judicious
investment
would
certainly
stand
the
scrutiny
of
any
who
could
possibly
have
any
cause
to
examine
his
ledgers
indeed
there
would
be
nothing
to
see
two
years
ago
morris
fortune
was
invested
in
certain
railway
debentures
and
government
stock
it
would
in
a
few
days
time
be
invested
there
again
precisely
as
it
had
been
taynton
had
not
been
dealing
in
securities
lately
and
could
not
absolutely
trust
his
memory
but
he
rather
thought
that
the
repurchase
could
be
made
at
a
somewhat
smaller
sum
than
had
been
realised
by
their
various
sales
dating
from
two
years
ago
in
that
case
there
was
a
little
more
reward
for
this
justice
weighed
but
featherwise
against
the
overwhelming
relief
of
the
knowledge
he
could
make
wrong
things
right
again
repair
his
yes
his
scoundrelism
how
futile
too
now
was
mills
threatened
blackmail
mills
might
if
he
chose
proclaim
on
any
convenient
housetop
that
his
partner
had
gambled
with
morris
that
according
to
the
ledgers
was
invested
in
certain
railway
debentures
and
other
securities
in
a
few
days
any
scrutiny
might
be
made
of
the
securities
lodged
at
the
county
bank
and
assuredly
among
them
would
be
found
those
debentures
those
securities
exactly
as
they
appeared
in
the
ledgers
yet
taynton
so
kindly
is
the
nature
of
happiness
contemplated
no
revengeful
step
on
his
partner
he
searched
his
heart
and
found
that
no
trace
of
rancour
against
poor
mills
was
hoarded
there
whether
happiness
makes
us
good
is
a
question
not
yet
decided
but
it
is
quite
certain
that
happiness
makes
us
forget
that
we
have
been
bad
and
it
seemed
to
taynton
as
he
sat
in
his
cool
and
ate
his
lunch
with
a
more
vivid
appetite
than
had
been
his
for
many
months
it
seemed
that
the
man
who
had
gambled
with
his
client
money
was
no
longer
himself
it
was
a
perfectly
different
person
who
had
done
that
it
was
a
different
man
too
who
so
few
days
ago
had
connived
at
and
applauded
the
sorry
trick
which
mills
had
tried
to
play
on
morris
when
so
futilely
it
is
true
he
had
slandered
him
to
sir
richard
now
he
felt
that
he
this
man
that
sat
here
was
incapable
of
such
meannesses
and
thank
god
it
was
never
too
late
from
he
would
lead
the
honourable
upright
existence
which
the
world
apart
from
his
partner
had
always
credited
him
with
leading
he
basked
in
the
full
sunshine
of
these
happy
and
comfortable
thoughts
and
even
as
the
sun
of
midsummer
lingered
long
on
the
sea
and
hills
so
for
hours
this
inward
sunshine
warmed
and
cheered
him
nor
was
it
till
he
saw
by
his
watch
that
he
must
return
from
the
long
pleasant
ramble
on
which
he
had
started
as
soon
as
lunch
was
over
that
a
cloud
filmy
and
thin
at
first
began
to
come
across
the
face
of
the
sun
once
and
again
those
genial
beams
dispersed
it
but
soon
it
seemed
as
if
the
vapours
were
getting
the
upper
hand
a
thought
in
fact
had
crossed
taynton
mind
that
quite
distinctly
dimmed
his
happiness
but
a
little
reflection
told
him
that
a
very
simple
step
on
his
part
would
put
that
right
again
and
he
walked
home
rather
more
quickly
than
he
had
set
out
since
he
had
this
little
bit
of
business
to
do
before
dinner
he
went
this
was
only
natural
to
the
house
where
mills
flat
was
situated
and
inquired
of
the
porter
whether
his
partner
had
yet
returned
but
the
same
answer
as
before
was
given
him
and
saying
that
he
had
need
of
a
document
that
mills
had
taken
home
with
him
three
days
before
he
went
up
in
the
lift
and
rang
the
bell
of
the
flat
but
it
was
not
his
servant
who
opened
it
but
sad
superintendent
figgis
for
some
reason
this
was
rather
a
shock
to
taynton
to
expect
one
face
and
see
another
is
always
though
ever
so
slightly
upsetting
but
he
instantly
recovered
himself
and
explained
his
errand
my
partner
took
home
with
him
on
tuesday
a
paper
which
is
concerned
with
my
business
he
said
would
you
kindly
let
me
look
round
for
it
figgis
weighed
this
request
nothing
must
be
removed
from
the
rooms
he
said
till
we
have
finished
our
search
search
for
what
asked
taynton
any
possible
clue
as
to
the
reason
of
mills
disappearance
but
in
ten
minutes
we
shall
have
done
if
you
care
to
wait
i
do
want
to
remove
anything
said
the
lawyer
i
merely
want
to
consult
at
the
moment
another
man
in
plain
clothes
came
out
of
the
he
carried
in
his
hand
two
or
three
letters
and
a
few
scraps
of
crumpled
paper
there
was
an
envelope
or
two
among
them
we
have
finished
sir
he
said
to
the
superintendent
figgis
turned
to
the
lawyer
who
was
looking
rather
fixedly
at
what
the
other
man
had
in
his
hand
my
document
may
be
among
those
he
said
figgis
handed
them
to
him
there
were
two
envelopes
both
addressed
to
the
missing
man
one
bearing
his
name
only
some
small
scrap
of
paper
and
three
or
four
private
letters
is
it
among
these
he
asked
taynton
turned
them
over
no
he
said
it
was
it
was
a
large
yes
a
large
blue
paper
official
looking
no
such
thing
in
the
flat
sir
said
the
second
man
very
annoying
said
the
lawyer
an
idea
seemed
slowly
to
strike
figgis
he
may
have
taken
it
to
london
with
him
he
said
but
will
you
not
look
round
taynton
did
so
he
also
looked
in
the
basket
but
it
was
empty
so
he
went
back
to
make
ready
to
receive
his
guests
for
the
little
party
but
it
had
got
dark
this
document
whatever
it
was
appeared
to
trouble
him
the
simple
step
he
had
contemplated
had
not
led
him
in
quite
the
right
direction
the
superintendent
with
his
colleague
went
back
into
the
on
the
lawyer
departure
and
figgis
took
from
his
pocket
most
of
his
notes
i
went
to
the
station
wilkinson
he
said
and
in
the
lost
luggage
office
i
found
mills
bag
it
had
arrived
on
thursday
evening
but
it
seems
pretty
certain
that
its
owner
did
not
arrive
with
it
looks
as
if
he
did
get
out
at
falmer
said
wilkinson
figgis
took
a
long
time
to
consider
this
it
is
possible
he
said
it
is
also
possible
that
he
put
his
luggage
into
the
train
in
london
and
subsequently
missed
the
train
himself
then
together
they
went
through
the
papers
that
might
conceivably
help
them
there
was
a
letter
found
in
his
bedroom
fireplace
and
the
crumpled
up
envelope
that
belonged
to
it
they
patiently
pieced
this
together
but
found
nothing
of
value
the
other
letters
referred
only
to
his
engagements
in
london
none
of
which
were
later
than
thursday
morning
there
remained
one
crumpled
up
envelope
also
from
the
paperbasket
but
no
letter
that
in
any
way
corresponded
with
it
it
was
addressed
in
a
rather
sprawling
eager
boyish
hand
no
letter
of
any
sort
to
correspond
asked
figgis
for
the
second
time
no
i
think
for
the
present
we
will
keep
it
said
he
the
little
party
at
taynton
was
gay
to
the
point
of
foolishness
and
of
them
all
none
was
more
than
the
host
morris
had
asked
him
in
an
undertone
on
arrival
whether
any
more
had
been
heard
and
learning
there
was
still
no
news
had
dismissed
the
subject
altogether
the
sunshine
of
the
day
too
had
come
back
to
the
lawyer
his
usual
cheerful
serenity
was
touched
with
a
sort
of
sympathetic
boisterousness
at
the
huge
spirits
of
the
young
couple
and
it
was
to
be
recorded
that
after
dinner
they
played
musical
chairs
and
buff
with
infinite
laughter
never
was
an
elderly
solicitor
so
spontaneously
gay
indeed
before
long
it
was
he
who
reinfected
the
others
with
merriment
but
as
always
after
abandonment
to
laughter
a
little
reaction
followed
and
when
they
went
upstairs
from
his
where
they
had
been
so
uproarious
so
that
it
might
be
made
tidy
again
before
sunday
and
sat
in
the
overlooking
the
street
there
did
come
this
little
reaction
but
it
was
already
eleven
and
soon
assheton
rose
to
go
the
night
was
hot
and
morris
was
sitting
to
cool
himself
by
the
open
window
leaning
his
head
out
to
catch
the
breeze
the
street
was
very
empty
and
quiet
and
his
motor
in
which
as
a
great
concession
his
mother
had
consented
to
be
carried
on
the
promise
of
his
going
slow
had
already
come
for
them
then
down
at
the
seaward
end
of
the
street
he
heard
as
if
some
sudden
news
had
come
in
that
sent
the
vendors
of
the
evening
papers
out
to
reap
a
second
harvest
that
night
he
could
not
however
catch
what
it
was
and
they
all
went
downstairs
together
madge
was
going
home
with
them
for
she
was
stopping
over
the
sunday
with
assheton
and
the
two
ladies
had
already
got
into
the
car
while
morris
was
still
standing
on
the
pavement
with
his
host
then
suddenly
a
newsboy
with
a
sheaf
of
papers
still
hot
from
the
press
came
running
from
the
corner
of
the
street
just
above
them
and
as
he
ran
he
shouted
out
the
news
which
was
already
making
little
groups
of
people
collect
and
gather
in
the
streets
taynton
turned
quickly
as
the
words
became
audible
seized
a
paper
from
the
boy
giving
him
the
first
coin
that
he
found
and
ran
back
into
the
hall
of
his
house
morris
with
him
to
beneath
the
electric
light
that
burned
there
the
shrill
voice
of
the
boy
still
shouting
the
news
of
murder
got
gradually
less
loud
as
he
went
further
down
the
street
they
read
the
short
paragraph
together
and
then
looked
at
each
other
with
mute
horror
in
their
eyes
chapter
ix
the
inquest
was
held
at
falmer
on
the
monday
following
when
the
body
was
formally
identified
by
taynton
and
mills
servant
and
they
both
had
to
give
evidence
as
regards
what
they
knew
of
the
movements
of
the
deceased
this
as
a
matter
of
fact
taynton
had
already
given
to
figgis
and
in
his
examination
now
he
repeated
with
absolute
exactitude
what
he
had
said
before
including
again
the
fact
that
morris
had
gone
up
to
town
on
friday
morning
to
try
to
find
him
there
on
this
occasion
however
a
few
further
questions
were
put
to
him
eliciting
the
fact
that
the
business
on
which
morris
wanted
to
see
him
was
known
to
taynton
but
could
not
be
by
him
repeated
since
it
dealt
with
confidential
transactions
between
the
firm
of
solicitors
and
their
client
the
business
was
yes
of
the
nature
of
a
dispute
but
taynton
regarded
it
as
certain
that
some
amicable
arrangement
would
have
been
come
to
had
the
interview
taken
place
as
it
had
not
however
since
morris
had
not
found
him
at
his
flat
in
town
he
could
not
speak
for
certain
on
this
subject
the
dispute
concerned
an
action
of
his
partner
made
independently
of
him
had
he
been
consulted
he
would
have
strongly
disapproved
of
it
the
body
as
was
made
public
now
had
been
discovered
by
accident
though
as
has
been
seen
the
probability
of
mills
having
got
out
at
falmer
had
been
arrived
at
by
the
police
and
figgis
immediately
after
his
interview
with
taynton
on
the
saturday
evening
had
started
for
falmer
to
make
inquiries
there
and
had
arrived
there
within
a
few
minutes
of
the
discovery
of
the
body
a
carpenter
of
that
village
had
strolled
out
about
eight
that
night
with
his
two
children
while
supper
was
being
got
ready
and
had
gone
a
piece
of
the
way
up
the
path
over
the
downs
which
left
the
road
at
the
corner
of
falmer
park
the
children
were
running
and
playing
about
hiding
and
seeking
each
other
in
the
hollows
and
among
the
trees
when
one
of
them
screamed
suddenly
and
a
moment
afterward
they
both
came
running
to
their
father
saying
that
they
had
come
upon
a
man
in
one
of
these
copses
lying
on
his
face
and
they
were
frightened
he
had
gone
to
see
what
this
terrifying
person
was
and
had
found
the
body
he
went
straight
back
to
the
village
without
touching
anything
for
it
was
clear
both
from
what
he
saw
and
from
the
crowd
of
buzzing
flies
that
the
man
was
dead
and
gave
information
to
the
police
then
within
a
few
minutes
from
that
figgis
had
arrived
from
brighton
to
find
that
it
was
superfluous
to
look
any
further
or
inquire
any
more
concerning
the
whereabouts
of
the
missing
man
all
that
was
mortal
of
him
was
here
the
head
covered
with
a
cloth
and
bits
of
the
fresh
summer
growth
of
fern
and
frond
sticking
to
his
clothing
after
the
identification
of
the
body
came
evidence
medical
and
otherwise
that
seemed
to
show
beyond
doubt
the
time
and
manner
of
his
death
and
the
possible
motive
of
the
murderer
the
base
of
the
skull
was
smashed
in
evidently
by
some
violent
blow
dealt
from
behind
with
a
blunt
heavy
instrument
of
some
sort
and
death
had
probably
been
instantaneous
in
one
of
the
pockets
was
a
first
edition
of
an
evening
paper
published
in
london
on
thursday
last
which
fixed
the
earliest
possible
time
at
which
the
murder
had
been
committed
while
in
the
opinion
of
the
doctor
who
examined
the
body
late
on
saturday
night
the
man
had
been
dead
not
less
than
hours
in
spite
of
the
very
heavy
rain
which
had
fallen
on
thursday
night
there
were
traces
of
a
pool
of
blood
about
midway
between
the
clump
of
bracken
where
the
body
was
found
and
the
path
over
the
downs
leading
from
falmer
to
brighton
this
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
information
already
given
by
taynton
made
it
practically
certain
that
the
deceased
had
left
london
on
the
thursday
as
he
had
intended
to
do
and
had
got
out
of
the
train
at
falmer
also
according
to
his
expressed
intention
to
walk
to
brighton
it
would
again
have
been
most
improbable
that
he
would
have
started
on
his
walk
had
the
storm
already
begun
but
the
train
by
which
his
bag
was
conveyed
to
brighton
arrived
at
falmer
at
six
the
storm
did
not
burst
till
an
hour
afterward
finally
with
regard
to
possible
motive
the
murdered
watch
was
missing
his
pockets
also
were
empty
of
coin
this
concluded
the
evidence
and
the
verdict
was
brought
in
without
the
jury
leaving
the
court
and
wilful
murder
by
person
or
persons
unknown
was
recorded
taynton
as
was
indeed
to
be
expected
had
been
much
affected
during
the
giving
of
his
evidence
and
when
the
inquest
was
over
he
returned
to
brighton
feeling
terribly
upset
by
this
sudden
tragedy
which
had
crashed
without
warning
into
his
life
it
had
been
so
swift
and
terrible
without
sign
or
preparation
this
man
whom
he
had
known
so
long
had
been
hurled
from
life
and
all
its
vigour
into
death
and
how
utterly
now
taynton
forgave
him
for
that
base
attack
that
he
had
made
on
him
so
few
days
ago
how
utterly
too
he
felt
sure
morris
had
forgiven
him
for
what
was
perhaps
even
harder
to
forgive
and
if
they
could
forgive
trespasses
like
these
they
who
were
of
human
passion
and
resentments
surely
the
reader
of
all
hearts
would
forgive
that
moment
of
agony
short
though
it
might
have
been
in
actual
duration
when
the
murderous
weapon
split
through
the
bone
and
scattered
the
brain
surely
brought
punishment
and
therefore
atonement
for
the
frailties
of
a
taynton
on
his
arrival
back
at
brighton
that
afternoon
devoted
a
couple
of
solitary
hours
to
such
thoughts
as
these
and
others
to
which
this
tragedy
naturally
gave
rise
and
then
with
a
supreme
effort
of
will
he
determined
to
think
no
more
on
the
subject
it
was
inevitable
that
his
mind
should
again
and
again
perhaps
for
weeks
and
months
to
come
fall
back
on
these
dreadful
events
but
his
will
was
set
on
not
permitting
himself
to
dwell
on
them
so
though
it
was
already
late
in
the
afternoon
he
set
forth
again
from
his
house
about
to
spend
a
couple
of
hours
at
the
office
he
had
sent
word
to
timmins
that
he
would
probably
come
in
and
begin
to
get
through
the
arrears
caused
by
his
unavoidable
absence
that
morning
and
he
found
his
head
clerk
waiting
for
him
a
few
words
were
of
course
appropriate
and
they
were
admirably
chosen
you
have
seen
the
result
of
the
inquest
no
doubt
timmins
he
said
and
yet
one
hardly
knows
whether
one
wishes
the
murderer
to
be
brought
to
justice
what
good
does
that
do
now
our
friend
is
dead
so
mean
and
petty
a
motive
too
just
for
a
watch
and
a
few
sovereigns
it
was
money
bought
at
a
terrible
price
was
it
not
poor
soul
poor
soul
yes
i
say
that
of
the
murderer
well
well
we
must
turn
our
faces
forward
timmins
it
is
no
use
dwelling
on
the
dreadful
irremediable
past
the
morning
post
is
that
it
timmins
ventured
sympathy
you
look
terribly
worn
out
sir
he
said
would
it
be
wiser
to
leave
it
till
a
good
night
rest
you
know
sir
if
excuse
my
mentioning
it
no
no
timmins
we
must
get
to
work
again
we
must
get
to
work
nature
inspired
by
the
spirit
and
instinct
of
life
is
wonderfully
recuperative
whether
earthquake
or
famine
fire
or
pestilence
has
blotted
out
a
thousand
lives
those
who
are
left
like
ants
when
their
house
is
disturbed
waste
but
little
time
after
the
damage
has
been
done
in
vain
lamentations
but
slaves
to
the
force
of
life
begin
almost
instantly
to
rebuild
and
reconstruct
and
what
is
true
of
the
community
is
true
also
of
the
individual
and
thus
in
three
days
from
this
dreadful
morning
of
the
inquest
taynton
after
attending
the
funeral
of
the
murdered
man
was
very
actively
employed
since
the
branch
of
the
firm
in
london
deprived
of
its
head
required
supervision
from
him
others
also
who
had
been
brought
near
to
the
tragedy
were
occupied
again
and
of
these
morris
in
particular
was
a
fair
example
of
the
spirit
of
the
his
effort
no
doubt
was
in
a
way
easier
than
that
made
by
taynton
for
to
be
years
old
and
in
love
should
be
occupation
sufficient
but
he
too
had
his
bad
hours
when
the
past
rose
about
him
and
he
recalled
that
evening
when
his
rage
had
driven
him
nearly
mad
with
passion
against
his
traducer
and
by
an
awful
coincidence
his
madness
had
been
contemporaneous
with
the
death
he
must
in
fact
have
been
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
place
at
the
time
the
murder
was
committed
for
he
had
gone
back
to
falmer
park
that
day
with
the
message
that
taynton
would
call
on
the
morrow
and
had
left
the
place
not
half
an
hour
before
the
breaking
of
the
storm
he
had
driven
by
the
corner
of
the
park
where
the
path
over
the
downs
left
the
main
road
and
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
him
at
that
moment
had
been
dead
or
alive
the
man
who
had
so
vilely
slandered
him
supposing
it
might
so
easily
have
happened
they
had
met
on
the
road
what
would
he
have
done
would
he
have
been
able
to
pass
him
and
not
wreaked
his
rage
on
him
he
hardly
dared
to
think
of
that
but
life
and
love
were
his
and
that
which
might
have
been
was
soon
dreamlike
in
comparison
of
these
indeed
that
dreadful
dream
which
he
had
had
the
night
after
the
murder
had
been
committed
was
no
less
real
than
it
the
past
was
all
of
this
texture
and
mistlike
it
was
evaporated
in
the
beams
of
the
day
that
was
his
now
brighton
is
a
populous
place
and
a
sunny
one
and
many
people
lounge
there
in
the
sun
all
day
but
for
the
next
three
or
four
days
a
few
of
these
loungers
lounged
somewhat
systematically
one
lounged
in
sussex
square
another
lounged
in
montpellier
road
one
or
two
others
who
apparently
enjoyed
this
fresh
air
but
did
not
care
about
the
town
itself
usually
went
to
the
station
after
breakfast
and
spent
the
day
in
rambling
agreeably
about
the
downs
they
also
frequented
the
pleasant
little
village
of
falmer
gossiping
freely
with
its
rural
inhabitants
often
footmen
or
gardeners
from
the
park
came
down
to
the
village
and
acquaintances
were
easily
ripened
in
the
otherwise
there
was
not
much
incident
in
the
village
sometimes
a
motor
drove
by
and
one
after
an
illegally
fast
progress
along
the
road
very
often
turned
in
at
the
park
gates
but
no
prosecution
followed
it
was
clear
they
were
not
agents
of
the
police
figgis
also
frequently
came
out
from
brighton
and
went
strolling
about
too
very
slowly
and
sadly
he
often
wandered
in
the
little
copses
that
bordered
the
path
over
the
downs
to
brighton
especially
near
the
place
where
it
joined
the
main
road
a
few
hundred
yards
below
falmer
station
then
came
a
morning
when
neither
he
nor
any
of
the
other
chance
visitors
to
falmer
were
seen
there
any
more
but
the
evening
before
figgis
carried
back
with
him
to
the
train
a
long
thin
package
wrapped
in
brown
paper
but
on
the
morning
when
these
strangers
were
seen
no
more
at
falmer
it
appeared
that
they
had
not
entirely
left
the
neighbourhood
for
instead
of
one
only
being
in
the
neighbourhood
of
sussex
square
there
were
three
of
them
there
morris
had
ordered
the
motor
to
be
round
that
morning
at
eleven
and
it
had
been
at
the
door
some
few
minutes
before
he
appeared
martin
had
driven
it
round
from
the
stables
but
he
was
in
a
suit
of
tweed
it
seemed
that
he
was
not
going
with
it
then
the
front
door
opened
and
morris
appeared
as
usual
in
a
violent
hurry
one
of
the
strangers
was
on
the
pavement
close
to
the
house
door
looking
with
interest
at
the
car
but
his
interest
in
the
car
ceased
when
the
boy
appeared
and
from
the
railings
of
the
square
garden
opposite
another
stranger
crossed
the
road
and
from
the
left
behind
the
car
came
a
third
morris
assheton
said
the
first
well
what
then
asked
morris
the
two
others
moved
a
little
nearer
i
arrest
you
in
the
king
name
said
the
first
morris
was
putting
on
a
light
coat
as
he
came
across
the
pavement
one
arm
was
in
the
other
out
he
stopped
dead
and
the
bright
colour
of
his
face
slowly
faded
leaving
a
sort
of
ashen
gray
behind
his
mouth
suddenly
went
dry
and
it
was
only
at
the
third
attempt
to
speak
that
words
came
what
for
he
said
for
the
murder
of
godfrey
mills
said
the
man
here
is
the
warrant
i
warn
you
that
all
you
say
morris
whose
lithe
athletic
frame
had
gone
slack
for
the
moment
stiffened
himself
up
again
i
am
not
going
to
say
anything
he
said
martin
drive
to
taynton
at
once
and
tell
him
that
i
am
arrested
the
other
two
now
had
closed
round
him
oh
i
not
going
to
bolt
he
said
please
tell
me
where
you
are
going
to
take
me
police
court
in
branksome
street
said
the
first
tell
taynton
i
am
there
said
morris
to
his
man
there
was
a
cab
at
the
corner
of
the
square
and
in
answer
to
an
almost
imperceptible
nod
from
one
of
the
men
it
moved
up
to
the
house
the
square
was
otherwise
nearly
empty
and
morris
looked
round
as
the
cab
drew
nearer
upstairs
in
the
house
he
had
just
left
was
his
mother
who
was
coming
out
to
falmer
this
evening
to
dine
above
illimitable
blue
stretched
from
horizon
to
horizon
behind
was
the
free
fresh
sea
birds
chirped
in
the
bushes
and
lilac
was
in
flower
everything
had
its
liberty
then
a
new
instinct
seized
him
and
though
a
moment
before
he
had
given
his
word
that
he
was
not
meditating
escape
liberty
called
to
him
everything
else
was
free
he
rushed
forward
striking
right
and
left
with
his
arms
then
tripped
on
the
edge
of
the
paving
stones
and
fell
he
was
instantly
seized
and
next
moment
was
in
the
cab
and
fetters
of
steel
though
he
could
not
remember
their
having
been
placed
there
were
on
his
wrists
chapter
x
it
was
a
fortnight
later
a
hot
july
morning
and
an
unusual
animation
reigned
in
the
staid
and
leisurely
streets
of
lewes
for
the
assizes
opened
that
day
and
it
was
known
that
the
first
case
to
be
tried
was
the
murder
of
which
all
brighton
and
a
large
part
of
england
had
been
talking
so
much
since
morris
assheton
had
been
committed
for
trial
at
the
hearing
in
the
there
was
not
very
much
evidence
brought
forward
but
there
had
been
sufficient
to
make
it
necessary
that
he
should
stand
his
trial
it
was
known
for
instance
that
he
had
some
very
serious
reason
for
anger
and
resentment
against
his
victim
those
who
had
seen
him
that
day
remembered
him
as
being
utterly
unlike
himself
he
was
known
to
have
been
at
falmer
park
that
afternoon
about
six
and
to
have
driven
home
along
the
falmer
road
in
his
car
an
hour
or
so
later
and
in
a
copse
close
by
to
where
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
was
found
had
been
discovered
a
thick
bludgeon
of
a
stick
broken
it
would
seem
by
some
violent
act
into
two
halves
on
the
top
half
was
rudely
cut
with
a
asshe
what
was
puzzling
however
was
the
apparent
motive
of
robbery
about
the
crime
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
victim
watch
was
missing
and
that
no
money
was
found
on
him
but
since
morris
had
been
brought
up
for
committal
at
the
it
was
believed
that
a
quantity
more
evidence
of
a
peculiarly
incriminating
kind
had
turned
up
yet
in
spite
of
this
so
it
was
rumoured
the
prisoner
apparently
did
more
than
bear
up
it
was
said
that
he
was
quite
cheerful
quite
confident
that
his
innocence
would
be
established
others
said
that
he
was
merely
callous
and
utterly
without
any
moral
sense
much
sympathy
of
course
was
felt
for
his
mother
and
even
more
for
the
family
of
the
templetons
and
the
daughter
to
whom
it
was
said
that
morris
was
actually
engaged
and
as
much
as
anyone
it
was
taynton
who
was
the
recipient
of
the
respectful
pity
of
the
british
public
though
no
relation
he
had
all
his
life
been
a
father
to
morris
and
while
miss
madge
templeton
was
young
and
had
the
spring
and
elasticity
of
youth
so
that
though
all
this
was
indeed
terrible
enough
she
might
be
expected
to
get
over
it
taynton
was
advanced
in
years
and
it
seemed
that
he
was
utterly
broken
by
the
shock
he
had
not
been
in
brighton
on
the
day
on
which
morris
was
brought
before
the
magistrates
and
the
news
had
reached
him
in
london
after
his
young
friend
had
been
committed
it
was
said
he
had
fainted
straight
off
and
there
had
been
much
difficulty
in
bringing
him
round
but
since
then
he
had
worked
day
and
night
on
behalf
of
the
accused
but
certain
fresh
evidence
which
had
turned
up
a
day
or
two
before
the
assizes
seemed
to
have
taken
the
heart
out
of
him
he
had
felt
confident
that
the
watch
would
have
been
found
and
the
thief
traced
but
something
new
that
had
turned
up
had
utterly
staggered
him
he
could
only
cling
to
one
hope
and
that
was
that
he
knew
the
evidence
about
the
stick
must
break
down
for
it
was
he
who
had
thrown
the
fragments
into
the
bushes
a
fact
which
would
come
to
light
in
his
own
evidence
but
at
the
most
all
he
could
hope
for
was
that
though
it
seemed
as
if
the
poor
lad
must
be
condemned
the
jury
on
account
of
his
youth
and
the
provocation
he
had
received
of
which
taynton
would
certainly
make
the
most
when
called
upon
to
bear
witness
on
this
point
or
owing
to
some
weakness
in
the
terrible
chain
of
evidence
that
had
been
woven
would
recommend
him
to
mercy
the
awful
formalities
at
the
opening
of
the
case
were
gone
through
the
judge
took
his
seat
and
laid
on
the
bench
in
front
of
him
a
small
parcel
wrapped
up
in
tissue
paper
the
jury
was
sworn
in
and
the
prisoner
asked
if
he
objected
to
the
inclusion
of
any
of
those
among
the
men
who
were
going
to
decide
whether
he
was
worthy
of
life
or
guilty
of
death
and
the
packed
court
composed
about
equally
of
men
and
women
most
of
whom
would
have
shuddered
to
see
a
dog
beaten
or
a
tired
hare
made
to
go
an
extra
mile
settled
themselves
in
their
places
with
a
rustle
of
satisfaction
at
the
thought
of
seeing
a
man
brought
before
them
in
the
shame
of
suspected
murder
and
promised
themselves
an
interesting
and
thrilling
couple
of
days
in
observing
the
gallows
march
nearer
him
and
in
watching
his
mental
agony
they
who
would
and
perhaps
did
subscribe
to
benevolent
institutions
for
the
relief
of
suffering
among
the
lower
animals
would
willingly
have
paid
a
far
higher
rate
to
observe
the
suffering
of
a
man
he
was
so
interesting
he
was
so
young
and
what
a
depraved
monster
he
must
be
and
that
little
package
in
tissue
paper
which
the
judge
brought
in
and
laid
on
the
bench
the
black
cap
was
it
not
that
showed
what
the
judge
thought
about
it
all
how
thrilling
counsel
for
the
crown
opened
the
case
and
in
a
speech
grimly
devoid
of
all
emotional
appeal
laid
before
the
court
the
facts
he
was
prepared
to
prove
on
which
they
would
base
their
verdict
the
prisoner
a
young
man
of
birth
and
breeding
had
strong
grounds
for
revenge
on
the
murdered
man
the
prosecution
however
was
not
concerned
in
defending
what
the
murdered
man
had
done
but
in
establishing
the
guilt
of
the
man
who
had
murdered
him
godfrey
mills
had
as
could
be
proved
by
witnesses
slandered
the
prisoner
in
an
abominable
manner
and
the
prosecution
were
not
intending
for
a
moment
to
attempt
to
establish
the
truth
of
his
slander
but
this
slander
they
put
forward
as
a
motive
that
gave
rise
to
a
murderous
impulse
on
the
part
of
the
prisoner
the
jury
would
hear
from
one
of
the
witnesses
an
old
friend
of
the
prisoner
and
a
man
who
had
been
a
sort
of
father
to
him
that
a
few
hours
only
before
the
murder
was
committed
the
prisoner
had
uttered
certain
words
which
admitted
only
of
one
interpretation
namely
that
murder
was
in
his
mind
that
the
provocation
was
great
was
not
denied
it
was
certain
however
that
the
provocation
was
sufficient
counsel
then
sketched
the
actual
circumstances
of
the
crime
as
far
as
they
could
be
constructed
from
what
evidence
there
was
this
evidence
was
purely
circumstantial
but
of
a
sort
which
left
no
reasonable
doubt
that
the
murder
had
been
committed
by
the
prisoner
in
the
manner
suggested
godfrey
mills
had
gone
to
london
on
the
tuesday
of
the
fatal
week
intending
to
return
on
the
thursday
on
the
wednesday
the
prisoner
became
cognisant
of
the
fact
that
godfrey
mills
had
he
would
not
argue
over
it
wantonly
slandered
him
to
sir
richard
templeton
a
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
whom
was
projected
in
the
prisoner
mind
which
there
was
reason
to
suppose
might
have
taken
place
should
the
jury
not
be
satisfied
on
that
point
witnesses
would
be
called
including
the
young
lady
herself
but
unless
the
counsel
for
the
defence
challenged
their
statement
namely
that
this
slander
had
been
spoken
which
contributed
so
it
was
argued
a
motive
for
the
crime
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
intrude
on
the
poignant
and
private
grief
of
persons
so
situated
and
to
insist
on
a
scene
which
must
prove
to
be
so
painful
there
was
a
slight
movement
of
demur
in
the
humane
and
crowded
court
at
this
it
was
just
these
painful
things
which
were
so
thrilling
it
was
most
important
continued
counsel
for
the
prosecution
that
the
jury
should
fix
these
dates
accurately
in
their
minds
tuesday
was
june
it
was
on
that
day
the
murdered
man
had
gone
to
london
designing
to
return
on
june
thursday
the
prisoner
had
learned
on
wednesday
june
that
aspersions
had
been
made
false
aspersions
on
his
character
and
it
was
on
thursday
that
he
learned
for
certain
from
the
lips
of
the
man
to
whom
they
had
been
made
who
was
the
author
of
them
the
author
was
godfrey
mills
he
had
thereupon
motored
back
from
falmer
park
and
informed
taynton
of
this
and
had
left
again
for
falmer
an
hour
later
to
make
an
appointment
for
taynton
to
see
sir
richard
he
knew
too
this
would
be
proved
that
godfrey
mills
proposed
to
return
from
london
that
afternoon
to
get
out
at
falmer
station
and
walk
back
to
brighton
it
was
certain
from
the
finding
of
the
body
that
mills
had
travelled
from
london
as
he
intended
and
that
he
had
got
out
at
this
station
it
was
certain
also
that
at
that
hour
the
prisoner
burning
for
vengeance
and
knowing
the
movements
of
mills
was
in
the
vicinity
of
falmer
to
proceed
it
was
certain
also
that
the
prisoner
in
a
very
strange
wild
state
had
arrived
at
taynton
house
about
nine
that
evening
knowing
that
mills
was
expected
there
at
about
granted
that
he
had
committed
the
murder
this
proceeding
was
dictated
by
the
most
elementary
instinct
of
it
was
also
in
accordance
with
that
that
he
had
gone
round
in
the
pelting
rain
late
that
night
to
see
if
the
missing
man
had
returned
to
his
flat
and
that
he
had
gone
to
london
next
morning
to
seek
him
there
he
had
not
of
course
found
him
and
he
returned
to
brighton
that
afternoon
in
connection
with
this
return
another
painful
passage
lay
before
them
for
it
would
be
shown
by
one
of
the
witnesses
that
again
on
the
friday
afternoon
the
prisoner
had
visited
the
scene
of
the
crime
taynton
in
fact
still
unsuspicious
of
anything
being
wrong
had
walked
over
the
downs
that
afternoon
from
brighton
to
falmer
and
had
sat
down
in
view
of
the
station
where
he
proposed
to
catch
a
train
back
to
brighton
and
had
seen
the
prisoner
stop
his
close
to
the
corner
where
the
body
had
been
found
and
behave
in
a
manner
inexplicable
except
on
the
theory
that
he
knew
where
the
body
lay
subsequently
to
the
finding
of
the
body
which
had
occurred
on
saturday
evening
there
had
been
discovered
in
a
coppice
adjoining
a
heavy
stick
broken
in
two
the
top
of
it
which
would
be
produced
bore
the
inscription
asshe
taynton
was
present
in
court
and
was
sitting
on
the
bench
to
the
right
of
the
judge
who
had
long
been
a
personal
friend
of
his
hitherto
his
face
had
been
hidden
in
his
hands
as
this
terribly
logical
tale
went
on
but
here
he
raised
it
and
smiled
a
wan
smile
enough
at
morris
the
latter
did
not
seem
to
notice
the
action
counsel
for
the
prosecution
continued
all
this
he
said
had
been
brought
forward
at
the
trial
before
the
magistrates
and
he
thought
the
jury
would
agree
that
it
was
more
than
sufficient
to
commit
the
prisoner
to
trial
at
that
trial
too
they
had
heard
the
whole
world
had
heard
of
the
mystery
of
the
missing
watch
and
the
missing
money
no
money
at
least
had
been
found
on
the
body
it
was
reasonable
to
refer
to
it
as
missing
but
here
again
the
motive
of
came
in
the
whole
thing
had
been
carefully
planned
the
prisoner
counsel
suggested
had
just
as
he
had
gone
up
to
town
to
find
mills
the
day
after
the
murder
was
committed
striven
to
put
justice
off
the
scent
in
making
it
appear
that
the
motive
for
the
crime
had
been
robbery
with
cunning
he
had
taken
the
watch
and
what
coins
there
were
from
the
pockets
of
his
victim
that
at
any
rate
was
the
theory
suggested
by
the
prosecution
the
speech
was
admirably
delivered
and
its
virtue
was
its
extreme
impassiveness
it
seemed
quite
impersonal
the
mere
automatic
action
of
justice
not
revengeful
not
seeking
for
death
but
merely
stating
the
case
as
it
might
be
stated
by
some
planet
or
remote
fixed
star
then
there
was
a
short
pause
while
the
prosecutor
for
the
crown
laid
down
his
notes
and
the
same
slow
clear
impassive
voice
went
on
but
since
the
committal
of
the
prisoner
to
stand
his
trial
at
these
assizes
he
said
more
evidence
of
an
utterly
unexpected
but
to
us
convincing
kind
has
been
discovered
here
it
is
and
he
held
up
a
sheet
of
blotting
paper
and
a
crumpled
envelope
a
letter
has
been
blotted
on
this
sheet
he
said
and
by
holding
it
up
to
the
light
and
looking
through
it
one
can
of
course
read
what
was
written
but
before
i
read
it
i
will
tell
you
from
where
this
sheet
was
taken
it
was
taken
from
a
blotting
book
in
the
of
assheton
house
in
sussex
square
an
expert
in
handwriting
will
soon
tell
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
in
whose
hand
he
without
doubt
considers
it
to
be
written
after
the
committal
of
the
prisoner
to
trial
search
was
of
course
made
in
this
house
for
further
evidence
this
evidence
was
almost
immediately
discovered
after
that
no
further
search
was
made
the
judge
looked
up
from
his
notes
by
whom
was
this
discovery
made
he
asked
by
superintendent
figgis
and
sergeant
wilkinson
my
lord
they
will
give
their
evidence
he
waited
till
the
judge
had
entered
this
i
will
read
the
letter
he
said
from
the
negative
so
to
speak
of
the
blotting
paper
june
to
godfrey
mills
esq
you
damned
brute
i
will
settle
you
i
hear
you
are
coming
back
to
brighton
and
are
getting
out
at
falmer
all
right
i
shall
be
there
and
we
shall
have
a
talk
morris
assheton
a
sort
of
purr
went
round
the
court
the
kind
humane
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
had
fought
for
seats
found
this
to
their
taste
the
noose
tightened
i
have
here
also
an
envelope
said
the
prosecutor
which
was
found
by
figgis
and
wilkinson
in
the
basket
in
the
of
the
deceased
according
to
the
expert
in
handwriting
whose
evidence
you
will
hear
it
is
undoubtedly
addressed
by
the
same
hand
that
wrote
the
letter
i
have
just
read
you
and
in
his
opinion
the
handwriting
is
that
of
the
prisoner
no
letter
was
found
in
the
deceased
man
room
corresponding
to
this
envelope
but
the
jury
will
observe
that
what
i
have
called
the
negative
of
the
letter
on
the
was
dated
june
the
day
that
the
prisoner
suspected
the
slander
that
had
been
levelled
at
him
the
suggestion
is
that
the
deceased
opened
this
before
leaving
for
london
and
took
the
letter
with
him
and
the
hand
that
for
the
purposes
of
misleading
justice
robbed
him
of
his
watch
and
his
money
also
destroyed
the
letter
which
was
then
on
his
person
and
which
was
an
incriminating
document
but
this
sheet
of
blotting
paper
is
as
valuable
as
the
letter
itself
it
proves
the
letter
to
have
been
written
morris
had
been
given
a
seat
in
the
dock
and
on
each
side
of
him
there
stood
a
but
in
the
awed
hush
that
followed
for
the
vultures
and
carrion
crows
who
crowded
the
court
were
finding
themselves
quite
beautifully
thrilled
he
wrote
a
few
words
on
a
slip
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
a
warder
to
give
to
his
counsel
and
his
counsel
nodded
to
him
the
opening
speech
for
the
crown
had
lasted
something
over
two
hours
and
a
couple
of
witnesses
only
were
called
before
the
interval
for
lunch
but
most
of
the
human
ghouls
had
brought
sandwiches
with
them
and
the
court
was
packed
with
the
same
people
when
morris
was
brought
up
again
after
the
interval
and
the
judge
breathing
sherry
took
his
seat
the
court
had
become
terribly
hot
but
the
public
were
too
humane
to
mind
that
a
criminal
was
being
chased
toward
the
gallows
and
they
followed
his
progress
there
with
breathless
interest
step
by
step
all
that
was
laid
down
in
the
opening
speech
for
the
prosecution
was
inexorably
proved
all
that
is
to
say
except
the
affair
of
the
stick
but
from
what
a
certain
witness
taynton
swore
to
it
was
clear
that
this
piece
of
circumstantial
evidence
which
indeed
was
of
the
greatest
importance
since
the
crown
case
was
that
the
murder
had
been
committed
with
that
bludgeon
of
a
stick
completely
broke
down
whoever
had
done
the
murder
he
had
not
done
it
with
that
stick
since
taynton
deposed
to
having
been
at
assheton
house
on
the
friday
the
day
after
the
murder
had
been
committed
and
to
having
taken
the
stick
away
by
mistake
believing
it
to
be
his
and
the
counsel
for
the
defence
only
asked
one
question
on
this
point
which
question
closed
the
proceedings
for
the
day
it
was
you
have
a
similar
stick
then
and
taynton
replied
in
the
affirmative
the
court
then
rose
on
the
whole
the
day
had
been
most
satisfactory
to
the
ghouls
and
vultures
and
it
seemed
probable
that
they
would
have
equally
exciting
and
plentiful
fare
next
day
but
in
the
opinion
of
many
morris
counsel
was
disappointing
he
did
not
witnesses
at
all
sensationally
and
drag
out
dreadful
secrets
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
about
their
private
lives
in
order
to
show
that
they
seldom
if
ever
spoke
the
truth
indeed
witness
after
witness
was
allowed
to
escape
without
any
at
all
there
was
no
attempt
made
to
prove
that
the
carpenter
who
had
found
the
body
had
been
himself
tried
for
murder
or
that
his
children
were
illegitimate
yet
gradually
as
the
afternoon
went
on
a
sort
of
impression
began
to
make
its
way
that
there
was
something
coming
which
no
one
suspected
the
next
morning
those
impressions
were
realised
when
the
adjourned
of
taynton
was
resumed
the
counsel
for
the
defence
made
an
immediate
attack
on
the
theories
of
the
prosecution
and
it
told
for
the
prosecution
had
suggested
that
morris
presence
at
the
scene
of
the
murder
the
day
after
was
suspicious
as
if
he
had
come
back
uneasily
and
of
an
unquiet
conscience
if
that
was
so
taynton
presence
there
who
had
been
the
witness
who
proved
the
presence
of
the
other
was
suspicious
also
what
had
he
come
there
for
in
order
to
throw
the
broken
pieces
of
morris
stick
into
the
bushes
these
inferences
were
of
course
but
suggested
in
the
questions
counsel
asked
taynton
in
the
further
of
this
morning
and
perhaps
no
one
in
court
saw
what
the
suggestion
was
for
a
moment
or
two
so
subtly
and
covertly
was
it
conveyed
then
it
appeared
to
strike
all
minds
together
and
a
subdued
rustle
went
round
the
court
followed
the
moment
after
by
an
even
intenser
silence
then
followed
a
series
of
interrogations
which
at
first
seemed
wholly
irrelevant
for
they
appeared
to
bear
only
on
the
business
relations
between
the
prisoner
and
the
witness
then
suddenly
like
the
dim
light
at
the
end
of
a
tunnel
where
shines
the
pervading
illuminating
sunlight
a
little
ray
dawned
you
have
had
control
of
the
prisoner
private
fortune
since
yes
in
the
year
he
had
or
thereabouts
in
london
and
debentures
in
consols
in
government
bonds
of
south
australia
i
have
no
doubt
those
figures
are
correct
a
fortnight
ago
you
bought
of
london
and
debentures
in
consols
in
government
bonds
of
south
australia
taynton
opened
his
lips
to
speak
but
no
sound
came
from
them
please
answer
the
question
if
there
had
been
a
dead
hush
before
succeeding
the
rustle
that
had
followed
the
suggestions
about
the
stick
a
silence
far
more
palpable
now
descended
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
what
the
suggestion
was
now
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
broke
in
i
submit
that
these
questions
are
irrelevant
my
lord
he
said
i
shall
subsequently
show
my
lord
that
they
are
not
the
witness
must
answer
the
question
said
the
judge
i
see
that
there
is
a
possible
relevancy
the
question
was
answered
thank
you
that
is
all
said
the
counsel
for
the
defence
and
taynton
left
the
witness
box
it
was
then
for
the
first
time
since
the
trial
began
that
morris
looked
at
this
witness
all
through
he
had
been
perfectly
calm
and
collected
a
circumstance
which
the
spectators
put
down
to
the
callousness
with
which
they
kindly
credited
him
and
now
for
the
first
time
as
taynton
eyes
and
his
met
an
emotion
crossed
the
prisoner
face
he
looked
sorry
chapter
xi
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
the
examination
of
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
went
on
for
there
were
a
very
large
number
of
them
but
when
the
court
rose
for
lunch
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
intimated
that
this
was
his
last
but
again
hardly
any
but
those
engaged
officially
the
judge
the
counsel
the
prisoner
the
warder
left
the
court
taynton
however
went
home
for
he
had
his
seat
on
the
bench
and
he
could
escape
for
an
hour
from
this
very
hot
and
oppressive
atmosphere
but
he
did
not
go
to
his
lewes
office
or
to
any
hotel
to
get
his
lunch
he
went
to
the
station
where
after
waiting
some
quarter
of
an
hour
he
took
the
train
to
brighton
the
train
ran
through
falmer
and
from
his
window
he
could
see
where
the
park
palings
made
an
angle
close
to
the
road
it
was
from
there
that
the
path
over
the
downs
where
he
had
so
often
walked
passed
to
brighton
again
the
judge
took
his
seat
still
carrying
the
little
parcel
wrapped
up
in
tissue
paper
there
was
no
need
for
the
usher
to
call
silence
for
the
silence
was
granted
without
being
asked
for
the
counsel
for
the
defence
called
the
first
witness
he
also
unwrapped
a
flat
parcel
which
he
had
brought
into
court
with
him
and
handed
it
to
the
witness
that
was
supplied
by
your
firm
yes
sir
who
ordered
it
mr
assheton
morris
assheton
that
is
did
he
order
it
from
you
you
yourself
yes
sir
did
he
give
any
specific
instructions
about
it
yes
sir
what
were
they
that
the
blotting
book
which
assheton
had
already
ordered
was
to
be
countermanded
and
that
this
was
to
be
sent
in
its
stead
on
june
you
mean
not
after
june
no
sir
the
instructions
were
that
it
was
not
to
be
sent
before
june
why
was
that
i
could
not
say
sir
those
were
the
instructions
and
it
was
sent
on
june
yes
sir
it
was
entered
in
our
book
the
book
in
question
was
produced
and
handed
to
the
jury
and
the
judge
that
is
all
mrs
assheton
she
stepped
into
the
box
and
smiled
at
morris
there
was
no
murmur
of
sympathy
no
rustling
the
whole
thing
was
too
tense
you
returned
home
on
june
last
from
a
visit
to
town
yes
at
what
time
i
could
not
say
to
the
minute
but
about
eleven
in
the
morning
you
found
letters
waiting
for
you
yes
anything
else
a
parcel
what
did
it
contain
a
it
was
a
present
from
my
son
on
my
birthday
is
this
the
yes
what
did
you
do
with
it
i
opened
it
and
placed
it
on
my
writing
table
in
the
thank
you
that
is
all
there
was
no
of
this
witness
and
after
the
pause
the
counsel
for
the
defence
spoke
again
superintendent
figgis
you
searched
the
house
of
assheton
in
sussex
square
yes
sir
what
did
you
take
from
it
a
leaf
from
a
sir
was
it
that
leaf
which
has
been
already
produced
in
court
bearing
the
impress
of
a
letter
dated
june
yes
sir
where
was
the
on
the
in
the
sir
you
did
not
examine
the
in
any
way
no
sir
counsel
opened
the
book
and
fitted
the
torn
out
leaf
into
its
place
we
have
here
the
impress
of
a
letter
dated
june
written
in
a
new
that
did
not
arrive
at
assheton
house
from
the
shop
till
june
it
threatens
threatens
a
man
who
was
murdered
supposedly
by
the
prisoner
on
june
yet
this
threatening
letter
was
not
written
till
june
after
he
had
killed
him
quiet
and
unemotional
as
had
been
the
address
for
the
crown
these
few
remarks
were
even
quieter
then
the
examination
continued
you
searched
also
the
flat
occupied
by
the
deceased
and
you
found
there
this
envelope
supposedly
in
the
handwriting
of
the
prisoner
which
has
been
produced
by
the
prosecution
yes
sir
this
is
it
yes
sir
thank
you
that
is
all
again
there
was
no
and
the
superintendent
left
the
witness
box
then
the
counsel
for
the
defence
took
up
two
blank
envelopes
in
addition
to
the
one
already
produced
and
supposedly
addressed
in
the
handwriting
of
the
prisoner
this
blue
envelope
he
said
is
from
the
stationery
in
assheton
house
this
other
envelope
white
is
from
the
flat
of
the
deceased
it
corresponds
in
every
way
with
the
envelope
which
was
supposed
to
be
addressed
in
the
prisoner
hand
found
at
the
flat
in
question
the
inference
is
that
the
prisoner
blotted
the
letter
dated
june
on
a
blotting
pad
which
did
not
arrive
in
assheton
house
till
june
went
to
the
deceased
flat
and
put
it
an
envelope
there
these
were
handed
to
the
jury
for
examination
ernest
smedley
said
counsel
mills
servant
stepped
into
the
box
and
was
sworn
between
let
us
say
june
and
june
did
the
prisoner
call
at
mills
flat
yes
sir
twice
when
once
on
the
evening
of
june
and
once
very
early
next
morning
did
he
go
in
yes
sir
he
came
in
on
both
occasions
what
for
to
satisfy
himself
that
mills
had
not
come
back
did
he
write
anything
no
sir
how
do
you
know
that
i
went
with
him
from
room
to
room
and
should
have
seen
if
he
had
done
so
did
anybody
else
enter
the
flat
during
those
days
yes
sir
who
mr
taynton
the
whole
court
seemed
to
give
a
great
sigh
then
it
was
quiet
again
the
judge
put
down
the
pen
with
which
he
had
been
taking
notes
and
like
the
rest
of
the
persons
present
he
only
listened
when
did
taynton
come
into
the
flat
about
or
a
little
later
on
friday
june
yes
sir
please
tell
the
jury
what
he
did
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
stood
up
i
object
to
that
question
he
said
the
judge
nodded
at
him
then
looked
at
the
witness
again
the
examination
went
on
you
need
not
answer
that
question
i
put
it
to
save
time
merely
did
taynton
go
into
the
deceased
yes
sir
did
he
write
anything
there
yes
sir
was
he
alone
there
yes
sir
thank
you
again
the
examining
counsel
paused
and
again
no
question
was
asked
by
the
prosecution
charles
martin
said
the
counsel
for
defence
you
are
a
servant
of
the
prisoner
yes
sir
you
were
in
his
service
during
this
week
of
june
of
which
friday
was
june
yes
sir
describe
the
events
no
did
the
prisoner
go
up
to
town
or
elsewhere
on
that
day
driving
his
motorcar
but
leaving
you
in
brighton
yes
sir
assheton
came
back
that
morning
yes
sir
did
anyone
call
that
morning
if
so
who
taynton
called
did
he
go
to
the
yes
sir
did
he
write
anything
there
yes
sir
he
wrote
a
note
to
assheton
which
he
gave
me
when
he
went
out
you
were
not
in
the
when
he
wrote
it
no
sir
did
he
say
anything
to
you
when
he
left
the
house
yes
sir
what
did
he
say
the
question
was
not
challenged
now
he
told
me
to
say
that
he
had
left
the
note
at
the
door
but
he
had
not
done
so
no
sir
he
wrote
it
in
the
thank
you
that
is
all
but
this
witness
was
not
allowed
to
pass
as
the
others
had
done
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
got
up
you
told
assheton
that
it
had
been
left
at
the
door
yes
sir
you
knew
that
was
untrue
yes
sir
for
what
reason
did
you
say
it
then
martin
hesitated
he
looked
down
then
he
looked
up
again
and
was
still
silent
answer
the
question
his
eyes
met
those
of
the
prisoner
morris
smiled
at
him
and
nodded
taynton
told
me
to
say
that
he
said
i
had
once
been
in
taynton
service
he
dismissed
me
i
the
judge
interposed
looking
at
the
counsel
do
you
press
your
question
he
asked
i
do
not
forbid
you
to
ask
it
but
i
ask
you
whether
the
case
for
the
prosecution
of
the
the
prisoner
is
furthered
by
your
insisting
on
this
question
we
have
all
heard
the
jury
and
i
alike
what
the
last
three
or
four
witnesses
have
said
and
you
have
allowed
that
quite
properly
in
my
opinion
to
go
unchallenged
i
do
not
myself
see
that
there
is
anything
to
be
gained
by
the
prosecution
by
pressing
the
question
i
ask
you
to
consider
this
point
if
you
think
conscientiously
that
the
evidence
the
trend
of
which
we
all
know
now
is
to
be
shaken
you
are
right
to
do
your
best
to
try
to
shake
it
if
not
i
wish
you
to
consider
whether
you
should
press
the
question
what
the
result
of
your
pressing
it
will
be
i
have
no
idea
but
it
is
certainly
clear
to
us
all
now
that
there
was
a
threat
implied
in
taynton
words
personally
i
do
not
wish
to
know
what
that
threat
was
nor
do
i
see
how
the
knowledge
of
it
would
affect
your
case
in
my
eyes
or
in
the
eyes
of
the
jury
there
was
a
moment
pause
no
my
lord
i
do
not
press
it
then
a
clear
young
voice
broke
the
silence
thanks
martin
it
said
it
came
from
the
dock
the
judge
looked
across
to
the
dock
for
a
moment
with
a
sudden
irresistible
impulse
of
kindliness
for
the
prisoner
whom
he
was
judging
charles
martin
he
said
you
have
given
your
evidence
and
speaking
for
myself
i
believe
it
to
be
entirely
trustworthy
i
wish
to
say
that
your
character
is
perfectly
clear
no
aspersion
whatever
has
been
made
on
it
except
that
you
said
a
note
had
been
delivered
at
the
door
though
you
knew
it
to
have
been
not
so
delivered
you
made
that
statement
through
fear
of
a
certain
individual
you
were
frightened
into
telling
a
lie
no
one
inquires
into
the
sources
of
your
fear
but
in
the
general
stillness
there
was
one
part
of
the
court
that
was
not
still
but
the
judge
made
no
command
of
silence
there
for
in
the
there
was
whispering
and
consultation
it
went
on
for
some
three
minutes
then
the
foreman
of
the
jury
stood
up
the
jury
have
heard
sufficient
of
this
case
my
lord
he
said
and
they
are
agreed
on
their
verdict
for
a
moment
the
buzzing
whispers
went
about
the
court
again
shrilling
high
but
instantaneously
they
died
down
and
the
same
tense
silence
prevailed
but
from
the
back
of
the
court
there
was
a
stir
and
the
judge
seeing
what
it
was
that
caused
it
waited
while
assheton
moved
from
her
place
and
made
her
way
to
the
front
of
the
dock
in
which
morris
sat
she
had
been
in
the
that
day
and
everyone
knew
her
and
all
made
way
for
her
moving
as
the
blades
of
corn
move
when
the
wind
stirs
them
for
her
right
was
recognised
and
unquestioned
but
the
dock
was
high
above
her
and
a
barrister
who
sat
below
instantly
vacated
his
seat
she
got
up
and
stood
on
it
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
and
none
saw
that
at
this
moment
a
telegram
was
handed
to
the
judge
which
he
opened
and
read
then
he
turned
to
the
foreman
of
the
jury
what
verdict
do
you
find
he
asked
not
guilty
assheton
had
already
grasped
morris
hands
in
hers
and
just
as
the
words
were
spoken
she
kissed
him
then
a
shout
arose
which
bade
fair
to
lift
the
roof
off
and
neither
judge
nor
ushers
of
the
court
made
any
attempt
to
quiet
it
and
if
it
was
only
for
the
sensation
of
seeing
the
gallows
march
nearer
the
prisoner
that
these
folk
had
come
together
yet
there
was
no
mistaking
the
genuineness
of
their
congratulations
now
morris
whole
behaviour
too
had
been
so
gallant
and
brave
innocent
though
he
knew
himself
to
be
yet
it
required
a
very
high
courage
to
listen
to
the
damning
accumulation
of
evidence
against
him
and
if
there
is
one
thing
that
the
ordinary
man
appreciates
more
than
sensation
it
is
pluck
then
but
not
for
a
long
time
the
uproar
subsided
and
the
silence
descended
again
then
the
judge
spoke
assheton
he
said
for
i
no
longer
can
call
you
prisoner
the
jury
have
of
course
found
you
not
guilty
of
the
terrible
crime
of
which
you
were
accused
and
i
need
not
say
that
i
entirely
agree
with
their
verdict
throughout
the
trial
you
have
had
my
sympathy
and
my
admiration
for
your
gallant
bearing
then
at
a
sign
from
the
judge
his
mother
and
he
were
let
out
by
the
private
door
below
the
bench
after
they
had
gone
silence
was
restored
everyone
knew
that
there
must
be
more
to
come
the
prisoner
was
found
not
guilty
the
murder
was
still
unavenged
then
once
more
the
judge
spoke
i
wish
to
make
public
recognition
he
said
of
the
fairness
and
ability
with
which
the
case
was
conducted
on
both
sides
the
prosecution
as
it
was
their
duty
to
do
forged
the
chain
of
evidence
against
assheton
as
strongly
as
they
were
able
and
pieced
together
incriminating
circumstances
against
him
with
a
skill
that
at
first
seemed
conclusive
of
his
guilt
the
first
thing
that
occurred
to
make
a
weak
link
in
their
chain
was
the
acknowledgment
of
a
certain
witness
that
the
stick
with
which
the
murder
was
supposed
to
have
been
committed
was
not
left
on
the
spot
by
the
accused
but
by
himself
why
he
admitted
that
we
can
only
conjecture
but
my
conjecture
is
that
it
was
an
act
of
repentance
and
contrition
on
his
part
when
it
came
to
that
point
he
could
not
let
the
evidence
which
he
had
himself
supplied
tell
against
him
on
whom
it
was
clearly
his
object
to
father
the
crime
you
will
remember
also
that
certain
circumstances
pointed
to
robbery
being
the
motive
of
the
crime
that
i
think
was
the
first
idea
so
to
speak
of
the
real
criminal
then
we
must
suppose
he
saw
himself
safer
if
he
forged
against
another
certain
evidence
which
we
have
heard
the
judge
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
went
on
with
evident
emotion
this
case
will
never
be
reopened
again
he
said
for
a
reason
that
i
will
subsequently
tell
the
court
we
have
seen
the
last
of
this
tragedy
and
retribution
and
punishment
are
in
the
hands
of
a
higher
and
supreme
tribunal
this
witness
edward
taynton
has
been
for
years
a
friend
of
mine
and
the
sympathy
which
i
felt
for
him
at
the
opening
of
the
case
when
a
young
man
to
whom
i
still
believe
him
to
have
been
attached
was
on
his
trial
is
changed
to
a
deeper
pity
during
the
afternoon
you
have
heard
certain
evidence
from
which
you
no
doubt
as
well
as
i
infer
that
the
fact
of
this
murder
having
been
committed
was
known
to
the
man
who
wrote
a
letter
and
blotted
it
on
the
sheet
which
has
been
before
the
court
that
man
also
as
it
was
clear
to
us
an
hour
ago
directed
a
certain
envelope
which
you
have
also
seen
i
may
add
that
taynton
had
as
i
knew
an
extraordinary
knack
of
imitating
handwritings
i
have
seen
him
write
a
signature
that
i
could
have
sworn
was
mine
but
he
has
used
that
gift
for
tragic
purposes
i
have
just
received
a
telegram
he
left
this
court
before
the
luncheon
interval
and
went
to
his
house
in
brighton
arrived
there
as
i
have
just
learned
he
poisoned
himself
and
may
god
have
mercy
on
his
soul
again
he
paused
the
case
therefore
is
closed
he
said
and
the
court
will
rise
for
the
day
you
will
please
go
out
in
silence
