this

is
cordially
dedicated
by
one
of
their
number
preface
of
the
eleventh
edition
when
the
earlier
editions
of
this
book
were
published
i
was
aware
of
the
existence
of
a
collection
of
documents
relating
to
la
salle
and
containing
important
material
to
which
i
had
not
succeeded
in
gaining
access
this
collection
was
in
possession
of
pierre
margry
director
of
the
archives
of
the
marine
and
colonies
at
paris
and
was
the
result
of
more
than
thirty
years
of
research
with
rare
assiduity
and
zeal
margry
had
explored
not
only
the
vast
depository
with
which
he
has
been
officially
connected
from
youth
and
of
which
he
is
now
the
chief
but
also
the
other
public
archives
of
france
and
many
private
collections
in
paris
and
the
provinces
the
object
of
his
search
was
to
throw
light
on
the
career
and
achievements
of
french
explorers
and
above
all
of
la
salle
a
collection
of
extraordinary
richness
grew
gradually
upon
his
hands
in
the
course
of
my
own
inquiries
i
owed
much
to
his
friendly
aid
but
his
collections
as
a
whole
remained
inaccessible
since
he
naturally
wished
to
be
the
first
to
make
known
the
results
of
his
labors
an
attempt
to
induce
congress
to
furnish
him
with
the
means
of
printing
documents
so
interesting
to
american
history
was
made
in
and
by
henry
harrisse
aided
by
the
american
minister
at
paris
but
it
unfortunately
failed
in
the
summer
and
autumn
of
i
had
numerous
interviews
with
margry
and
at
his
desire
undertook
to
try
to
induce
some
american
bookseller
to
publish
the
collection
on
returning
to
the
united
states
i
accordingly
made
an
arrangement
with
little
brown
of
boston
by
which
they
agreed
to
print
the
papers
if
a
certain
number
of
subscriptions
should
first
be
obtained
the
condition
proved
very
difficult
and
it
became
clear
that
the
best
hope
of
success
lay
in
another
appeal
to
congress
this
was
made
in
the
following
winter
in
conjunction
with
hon
washburne
colonel
charles
whittlesey
of
cleveland
marshall
of
buffalo
and
other
gentlemen
interested
in
early
american
history
the
attempt
succeeded
congress
made
an
appropriation
for
the
purchase
of
five
hundred
copies
of
the
work
to
be
printed
at
paris
under
direction
of
margry
and
the
three
volumes
devoted
to
la
salle
are
at
length
before
the
public
of
the
papers
contained
in
them
which
i
had
not
before
examined
the
most
interesting
are
the
letters
of
la
salle
found
in
the
original
by
margry
among
the
immense
accumulations
of
the
archives
of
the
marine
and
colonies
and
the
bibliothèque
nationale
the
narrative
of
la
salle
companion
joutel
far
more
copious
than
the
abstract
printed
in
under
the
title
of

also
deserves
special
mention
these
with
other
fresh
material
in
these
three
volumes
while
they
add
new
facts
and
throw
new
light
on
the
character
of
la
salle
confirm
nearly
every
statement
made
in
the
first
edition
of
the
discovery
of
the
great
west
the
only
exception
of
consequence
relates
to
the
causes
of
la
salle
failure
to
find
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
in
and
to
the
conduct
on
that
occasion
of
the
naval
commander
beaujeu
this
edition
is
revised
throughout
and
in
part
rewritten
with
large
additions

country
traversed
by

explorers

name
of
la

is
placed
on

seems
to
be
demanded

prominence

besides
the
three
volumes
relating
to

there
will
be

relating
to

explorers
in
accordance
with
the
agreement
with

an
independent
edition
will
appear
in

with
an
introduction
setting
forth
the
circumstances
of
the
publication
preface
of
the
first
edition
the
discovery
of
the
great
west
or
the
valleys
of
the
mississippi
and
the
lakes
is
a
portion
of
our
history
hitherto
very
obscure
those
magnificent
regions
were
revealed
to
the
world
through
a
series
of
daring
enterprises
of
which
the
motives
and
even
the
incidents
have
been
but
partially
and
superficially
known
the
chief
actor
in
them
wrote
much
but
printed
nothing
and
the
published
writings
of
his
associates
stand
wofully
in
need
of
interpretation
from
the
unpublished
documents
which
exist
but
which
have
not
heretofore
been
used
as
material
for
history
this
volume
attempts
to
supply
the
defect
of
the
large
amount
of
wholly
new
material
employed
in
it
by
far
the
greater
part
is
drawn
from
the
various
public
archives
of
france
and
the
rest
from
private
sources
the
discovery
of
many
of
these
documents
is
due
to
the
indefatigable
research
of
pierre
margry
assistant
director
of
the
archives
of
the
marine
and
colonies
at
paris
whose
labors
as
an
investigator
of
the
maritime
and
colonial
history
of
france
can
be
appreciated
only
by
those
who
have
seen
their
results
in
the
department
of
american
colonial
history
these
results
have
been
invaluable
for
besides
several
private
collections
made
by
him
he
rendered
important
service
in
the
collection
of
the
french
portion
of
the
brodhead
documents
selected
and
arranged
the
two
great
series
of
colonial
papers
ordered
by
the
canadian
government
and
prepared
with
vast
labor
analytical
indexes
of
these
and
of
supplementary
documents
in
the
french
archives
as
well
as
a
copious
index
of
the
mass
of
papers
relating
to
louisiana
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
valuable
publications
on
the
maritime
history
of
france
which
have
appeared
from
his
pen
are
an
earnest
of
more
extended
contributions
in
future
the
late
president
sparks
some
time
after
the
publication
of
his
life
of
la
salle
caused
a
collection
to
be
made
of
documents
relating
to
that
explorer
with
the
intention
of
incorporating
them
in
a
future
edition
this
intention
was
never
carried
into
effect
and
the
documents
were
never
used
with
the
liberality
which
always
distinguished
him
he
placed
them
at
my
disposal
and
this
privilege
has
been
kindly
continued
by
sparks
abbé
faillon
the
learned
author
of

has
sent

copies
of

the

is

passed

journeyings
in

reached

this
was
jean
nicollet
interpreter
at

rivers
on
the
lawrence
he
had
been
some
twenty
years
in

had
lived
among
the
savage
algonquins
of
allumette
island
and
spent
eight
or
nine
years
among
the
nipissings
on
the
lake
which
bears
their
name
here
he
became
an
indian
in
all
his
habits
but
remained
nevertheless
a
zealous
catholic
and
returned
to
civilization
at
last
because
he
could
not
live
without
the
sacraments
strange
stories
were
current
among
the
nipissings
of
a
people
without
hair
or
beard
who
came
from
the
west
to
trade
with
a
tribe
beyond
the
great
lakes
who
could
doubt
that
these
strangers
were
chinese
or
japanese
such
tales
may
well
have
excited
curiosity
and
when
in
or
possibly
in
he
was
sent
as
an
ambassador
to
the
tribe
in
question
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
if
on
arriving
he
had
found
a
party
of
mandarins
among
them
perhaps
it
was
with
a
view
to
such
a
contingency
that
he
provided
himself
as
a
dress
of
ceremony
with
a
robe
of
chinese
damask
embroidered
with
birds
and
flowers
the
tribe
to
which
he
was
sent
was
that
of
the
winnebagoes
living
near
the
head
of
the
green
bay
of
lake
michigan
they
had
come
to
blows
with
the
hurons
allies
of
the
french
and
nicollet
was
charged
to
negotiate
a
peace
when
he
approached
the
winnebago
town
he
sent
one
of
his
indian
attendants
to
announce

coming
put
on
his
robe
of
damask
and
advanced
to
meet
the
expectant
crowd
with
a
pistol
in
each
hand
the
squaws
and
children
fled
screaming
that
it
was
a
manito
or
spirit
armed
with
thunder
and
lightning
but
the
chiefs
and
warriors
regaled
him
with
so
bountiful
a
hospitality
that
a
hundred
and
twenty
beavers
were
devoured
at

from
the

he
passed
westward
ascended
fox

crossed
to
the
wisconsin
and
descended
it
so
far
that
as
he
reported
on
his
return
in
three
days
more
he
would
have
reached
the
sea
the
truth
seems
to
be
that
he
mistook
the
meaning
of
his
indian
guides
and
that
the
great
water
to
which
he
was
so
near
was
not
the
sea
but
the
mississippi
it
has
been
affirmed
that
one
colonel
wood
of
virginia
reached
a
branch
of
the
mississippi
as
early
as
the
year
and
that
about
a
certain
captain
bolton
penetrated
to
the
river
itself
neither
statement
is
sustained
by
sufficient
evidence
it
is
further
affirmed
that
in
a
party
from
new
england
crossed
the
mississippi
reached
new
mexico
and
returning
reported
their
discoveries
to
the
authorities
of
boston

as

it

the

better
known
by
the

of

his
father
jean
and
his
uncle
henri
were
wealthy
merchants
living
more
like
nobles
than
like
burghers
and
the
boy
received
an
education
answering
to
the
marked
traits
of
intellect
and
character
which
he
soon
began
to
display
he
showed
an
inclination
for
the
exact
sciences
and
especially
for
the
mathematics
in
which
he
made
great
proficiency
at
an
early
age
it
is
said
he
became
connected
with
the
jesuits
and
though
doubt
has
been
expressed
of
the
statement
it
is
probably
true
sidenote

and
the
jesuits
la

was
always
an
earnest
catholic
and
yet
judging
by
the
qualities
which
his
evinced
he
was
not
very
liable
to
religious
enthusiasm
it
is
nevertheless
clear
that
the
society
of
jesus
may
have
had
a
powerful
attraction
for
his
youthful
imagination
this
great
organization
so
complicated
yet
so
harmonious
a
mighty
machine
moved
from
the
centre
by
a
single
hand
was
an
image
of
regulated
power
full
of
fascination
for
a
mind
like
his
but
if
it
was
likely
that
he
would
be
drawn
into
it
it
was
no
less
likely
that
he
would
soon
wish
to
escape
to
find
himself
not
at
the
centre
of
power
but
at
the
circumference

will
taught
to
walk
in
prescribed
paths
to
renounce
his
individuality
and
become
a
component
atom
of
a
vast
whole
would
have
been
intolerable
to
him
nature
had
shaped
him
for
other
uses
than
to
teach
a
class
of
boys
on
the
benches
of
a
jesuit
school
nor
on
his
part
was
he
likely
to
please
his
directors
for
and
as
he
was
he
was
far
too
intractable
a

to
serve

hid
an
inexhaustible

of

nursed

and
the
manifestation
of
conscience
could
hardly
drag
to
the
light
whose
strong
personality
would
not
yield
to
the
shaping
hand
and
who
by
a
necessity
of
his
nature
could
obey
no

it
is
said
on
good

with
a
reputation
of
excellent
acquirements
and
unimpeachable
morals
this
last
is
very
credible
the
cravings
of
a
deep
ambition
the
hunger
of
an
insatiable
intellect
the
intense
longing
for
action
and
achievement
subdued
in
him
all
other
passions
and
in
his
faults
the
love
of
pleasure
had
no
part
he
had
an
elder
brother
in
canada
the
abbé
jean
cavelier
a
priest
of
sulpice
apparently
it
was
this
that
shaped
his
destinies
his
connection
with
the
jesuits
had
deprived
him
under
the
french
law
of
the
inheritance
of
his
father
who
had
died
not
long
before
an
allowance
was
made
to
him
of
three
or
as
is
elsewhere
stated
four
hundred
livres
a
year
the
capital
of
which
was
paid
over
to
him
and
with
this
pittance
he
sailed
for
canada
to
seek
his
fortune
in
the
spring
of
sidenote
la
salle
at
montreal
next
we
find
him
at
montreal
in
another
volume
we
have
seen
how
an
association
of
enthusiastic
devotees
had
made
a
settlement
at
this
place
having
in
some
measure
accomplished
its
work
it
was
now
dissolved
and
the
corporation
of
priests
styled
the
seminary
of
sulpice
which
had
taken
a
prominent
part
in
the
enterprise
and
indeed
had
been
created
with
a
view
to
it
was
now
the
proprietor
and
the
feudal
lord
of
montreal
it
was
destined
to
retain
its
seignorial
rights
until
the
abolition
of
the
feudal
tenures
of
canada
in
our
own
day
and
it
still
holds
vast
possessions
in
the
city
and
island
these
worthy
ecclesiastics
models
of
a
discreet
and
sober
conservatism
were
holding
a
post
with
which
a
band
of
veteran
soldiers
or
warlike
frontiersmen
would
have
been
better
matched
montreal
was
perhaps
the
most
dangerous
place
in
canada
in
time
of
war
which
might
have
been
called
the
normal
condition
of
the
colony
it
was
exposed
by
its
position
to
incessant
inroads
of
the
iroquois
or
five
nations
of
new
york
and
no
man
could
venture
into
the
forests
or
the
fields
without
bearing
his
life
in
his
hand
the
savage
confederates
had
just
received
a
sharp
chastisement
at
the
hands
of
courcelle
the
governor
and
the
result
was
a
treaty
of
peace
which
might
at
any
moment
be
broken
but
which
was
an
inexpressible
relief
while
it
lasted
the
priests
of
sulpice
were
granting
out
their
lands
on
very
easy
terms
to
settlers
they
wished
to
extend
a
thin
line
of
settlements
along
the
front
of
their
island
to
form
a
sort
of
outpost
from
which
an
alarm
could
be
given
on
any
descent
of
the
iroquois
la
salle
was
the
man
for
such
a
purpose
had
the
priests
understood
him
which
they
evidently
did
not
for
some
of
them
suspected
him
of
levity
the
last
foible
with
which
he
could
be
charged
had
they
understood
him
they
would
have
seen
in
him
a
young
man
in
whom
the
fire
of
youth
glowed
not
the
less
ardently
for
the
veil
of
reserve
that
covered
it
who
would
shrink
from
no
danger
but
would
not
court
it
in
bravado
and
who
would
cling
with
an
invincible
tenacity
of
gripe
to
any
purpose
which
he
might
espouse
there
is
good
reason
to
think
that
he
had
come
to
canada
with
purposes
already
conceived
and
that
he
was
ready
to
avail
himself
of
any
which
might
help
to
realize
them
queylus
superior
of
the
seminary
made
him
a
generous
offer
and
he
accepted
it
this
was
the
gratuitous
grant
of
a
large
tract
of
land
at
the
place
now
called
la
chine
above
the
great
rapids
of
the
same
name
and
eight
or
nine
miles
from
montreal
on
one
hand
the
place
was
greatly
exposed
to
attack
and
on
the
other
it
was
favorably
situated
for
the
la
salle
and
his
successors
became
its
feudal
proprietors
on
the
sole
condition
of
delivering
to
the
seminary
on
every
change
of
ownership
a
medal
of
fine
silver
weighing
one
mark
he
entered
on
the
improvement
of
his
new
domain
with
what
means
he
could
command
and
began
to
grant
out
his
land
to
such
settlers
as
would
join
him
approaching
the
shore
where
the
city
of
montreal
now
stands
one
would
have
seen
a
row
of
small
compact
dwellings
extending
along
a
narrow
street
parallel
to
the
river
and
then
as
now
called
paul
street
on
a
hill
at
the
right
stood
the
windmill
of
the
seigniors
built
of
stone
and
pierced
with
loopholes
to
serve
in
time
of
need
as
a
place
of
defence
on
the
left
in
an
angle
formed
by
the
junction
of
a
rivulet
with
the
lawrence
was
a
square
bastioned
fort
of
stone
here
lived
the
military
governor
appointed
by
the
seminary
and
commanding
a
few
soldiers
of
the
regiment
of
carignan
in
front
on
the
line
of
the
street
were
the
enclosure
and
buildings
of
the
seminary
and
nearly
adjoining
them
those
of
the
or
hospital
both
provided
for
defence
in
case
of
an
indian
attack
in
the
hospital
enclosure
was
a
small
church
opening
on
the
street
and
in
the
absence
of
any
other
serving
for
the
whole
settlement
landing
passing
the
fort
and
walking
southward
along
the
shore
one
would
soon
have
left
the
rough
clearings
and
entered
the
primeval
forest
here
mile
after
mile
he
would
have
journeyed
on
in
solitude
when
the
hoarse
roar
of
the
rapids
foaming
in
fury
on
his
left
would
have
reached
his
listening
ear
and
at
length
after
a
walk
of
some
three
hours
he
would
have
found
the
rude
beginnings
of
a
settlement
it
was
where
the
lawrence
widens
into
the
broad
expanse
called
the
lake
of
louis
here
la
salle
had
traced
out
the
circuit
of
a
palisaded
village
and
assigned
to
each
settler
half
an
arpent
or
about
the
third
of
an
acre
within
the
enclosure
for
which
he
was
to
render
to
the
young
seignior
a
yearly
acknowledgment
of
three
capons
besides
six
deniers
that
is
half
a
sou
in
money
to
each
was
assigned
moreover
sixty
arpents
of
land
beyond
the
limits
of
the
village
with
the
perpetual
rent
of
half
a
sou
for
each
arpent
he
also
set
apart
a
common
two
hundred
arpents
in
extent
for
the
use
of
the
settlers
on
condition
of
the
payment
by
each
of
five
sous
a
year
he
reserved
four
hundred
and
twenty
arpents
for
his
own
personal
domain
and
on
this
he
began
to
clear
the
ground
and
erect
buildings
similar
to
this
were
the
beginnings
of
all
the
canadian
seigniories
formed
at
this
troubled
period
sidenote
la
chine
that
la
salle
came
to
canada
with
objects
distinctly
in
view
is
probable
from
the
fact
that
he
at
once
began
to
study
the
indian
languages
and
with
such
success
that
he
is
said
within
two
or
three
years
to
have
mastered
the
iroquois
and
seven
or
eight
other
languages
and
dialects
from
the
shore
of
his
seigniory
he
could
gaze
westward
over
the
broad
breast
of
the
lake
of
louis
bounded
by
the
dim
forests
of
chateauguay
and
beauharnois
but
his
thoughts
flew
far
beyond
across
the
wild
and
lonely
world
that
stretched
towards
the
sunset
like
champlain
and
all
the
early
explorers
he
dreamed
of
a
passage
to
the
south
sea
and
a
new
road
for
commerce
to
the
riches
of
china
and
japan
indians
often
came
to
his
secluded
settlement
and
on
one
occasion
he
was
visited
by
a
band
of
the
seneca
iroquois
not
long
before
the
scourge
of
the
colony
but
now
in
virtue
of
the
treaty
wearing
the
semblance
of
friendship
the
visitors
spent
the
winter
with
him
and
told
him
of
a
river
called
the
ohio
rising
in
their
country
and
flowing
into
the
sea
but
at
such
a
distance
that
its
mouth
could
only
be
reached
after
a
journey
of
eight
or
nine
months
evidently
the
ohio
and
the
mississippi
are
here
merged
into
one
in
accordance
with
geographical
views
then
prevalent
he
conceived
that
this
great
river
must
needs
flow
into
the
vermilion
sea
that
is
the
gulf
of
california
if
so
it
would
give
him
what
he
sought
a
western
passage
to
china
while
in
any
case
the
populous
indian
tribes
said
to
inhabit
its
banks
might
be
made
a
source
of
great
commercial
profit
sidenote
schemes
of
discovery
la
salle
imagination
took
fire
his
resolution
was
soon
formed
and
he
descended
the
lawrence
to
quebec
to
gain
the
countenance
of
the
governor
for
his
intended
exploration
few
men
were
more
skilled
than
he
in
the
art
of
clear
and
plausible
statement
both
the
governor
courcelle
and
the
intendant
talon
were
readily
won
over
to
his
plan
for
which
however
they
seem
to
have
given
him
no
more
substantial
aid
than
that
of
the
governor
letters
patent
authorizing
the
enterprise
the
cost
was
to
be
his
own
and
he
had
no
money
having
spent
it
all
on
his
seigniory
he
therefore
proposed
that
the
seminary
which
had
given
it
to
him
should
buy
it
back
again
with
such
improvements
as
he
had
made
queylus
the
superior
being
favorably
disposed
towards
him
consented
and
bought
of
him
the
greater
part
while
la
salle
sold
the
remainder
including
the
clearings
to
one
jean
milot
an
for
hundred
livres
with
this
he
bought
four
canoes
with
the
necessary
supplies
and
hired
fourteen
men
meanwhile
the
seminary
itself
was
preparing
a
similar
enterprise
the
jesuits
at
this
time
not
only
held
an
ascendency
over
the
other
ecclesiastics
in
canada
but
exercised
an
inordinate
influence
on
the
civil
government
the
seminary
priests
of
montreal
were
jealous
of
these
powerful
rivals
and
eager
to
emulate
their
zeal
in
the
saving
of
souls
and
the
conquering
of
new
domains
for
the
faith
under
this
impulse
they
had
three
years
before
established
a
mission
at
quinté
on
the
north
shore
of

ontario
in
charge
of
two
of
their

one
of
whom

spent
the

in

of
the

where
an
indian
prisoner
captured
in
the
northwest
told
him
of
populous
tribes
of
that
quarter
living
in
heathenish
darkness
on
this
the
seminary
priests
resolved
to
essay
their
conversion
and
an
expedition
to
be
directed
by

was
fitted
out
to
this
end

was
not
ill
suited

he
had
been
a

in

and

as
an

under

was

by

three

completed

the

unpropitious

chief
had
lately
been
murdered
by
three
scoundrel
soldiers
of
the
fort
of

and
while
they
were
undergoing
their
trial
it
became
known
that
three

frenchmen
had
treacherously
put
to
death
several
iroquois
of
the

tribe
in

to
get
possession

the
whole

happily
the
event
proved
otherwise
the
authors
of
the
last
murder
escaped
but
the
three
soldiers
were
shot
at
montreal
in
presence
of
a
considerable
number
of
the
iroquois
who
declared
themselves
satisfied
with
the
atonement
and

to
the

conclusion
we
shall
find

allusions
hereafter
to
la

having
in
his
youth
taught
in
a
school
which
in
his
position
could
only
have
been
in

with
some

the
doubts
alluded

have
proceeded
from
the

of

to
find
the
name
of
la

on
the

if

with
the

it

appears
however
that
he
had
brought
himself
under

operation
of

debarred

this
sort
of
life
seemed
so
strange
to
us
that
we
all
felt
the
effects
of
it
and
before
we
were
a
hundred
leagues
from
montreal
not
one
of
us
was
free
from
some
malady
or
other
at
last
after
all
our
misery
on
the
second
of
august
we
discovered
lake
ontario
like
a
great
sea
with
no
land
beyond
it
sidenote
the
seneca
villages
days
after
leaving
la
chine
they
reached
irondequoit
bay
on
the
south
side
of
the
lake
here
they
were
met
by
a
number
of
seneca
indians
who
professed
friendship
and
invited
them
to
their
villages
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
distant
as
this
was
on
their
way
to
the
upper
waters
of
the
ohio
and
as
they
hoped
to
find
guides
at
the
villages
to
conduct
them
they
accepted
the
invitation
dollier
with
most
of
the
men
remained
to
guard
the
canoes
while
la
salle
with
galinée
and
eight
other
frenchmen
accompanied
by
a
troop
of
indians
set
out
on
the
morning
of
the
twelfth
and
reached
the
principal
village
before
evening
it
stood
on
a
hill
in
the
midst
of
a
clearing
nearly
two
leagues
in
compass
a
rude
stockade
surrounded
it
and
as
the
visitors
drew
near
they
saw
a
band
of
old
men
seated
on
the
grass
waiting
to
receive
them
one
of
these
veterans
so
feeble
with
age
that
he
could
hardly
stand
made
them
an
harangue
in
which
he
declared
that
the
senecas
were
their
brothers
and
invited
them
to
enter
the
village
they
did
so
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
savages
and
presently
found
themselves
in
the
midst
of
a
disorderly
cluster
of
large
but
filthy
abodes
of
bark
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
in
number
the
most
capacious
of
which
was
assigned
to
their
use
here
they
made
their
quarters
and
were
soon
overwhelmed
by
seneca
hospitality
children
brought
them
pumpkins
and
berries
from
the
woods
and
boy
messengers
came
to
summon
them
to
endless
feasts
where
they
were
regaled
with
the
flesh
of
dogs
and
with
boiled
maize
seasoned
with
oil
pressed
from
nuts
and
the
seed
of
sunflowers
la
salle
had
flattered
himself
that
he
knew
enough
iroquois
to
hold
communication
with
the
senecas
but
he
failed
completely
in
the
attempt
the
priests
had
a
dutch
interpreter
who
spoke
iroquois
fluently
but
knew
so
little
french
and
was
withal
so
obstinate
that
he
proved
useless
so
that
it
was
necessary
to
employ
a
man
in
the
service
of
the
jesuit
fremin
whose
mission
was
at
this
village
what
the
party
needed
was
a
guide
to
conduct
them
to
the
ohio
and
soon
after
their
arrival
a
party
of
warriors
appeared
with
a
young
prisoner
belonging
to
one
of
the
tribes
of
that
region
galinée
wanted
to
beg
or
buy
him
from
his
captors
but
the
senecas
had
other
intentions
i
saw
writes
the
priest
the
most
miserable
spectacle
i
ever
beheld
in
my
life
it
was
the
prisoner
tied
to
a
stake
and
tortured
for
six
hours
with
diabolical
ingenuity
while
the
crowd
danced
and
yelled
with
delight
and
the
chiefs
and
elders
sat
in
a
row
smoking
their
pipes
and
watching
the
contortions
of
the
victim
with
an
air
of
serene
enjoyment
the
body
was
at
last
cut
up
and
eaten
and
in
the
evening
the
whole
population
occupied
themselves
in
scaring
away
the
angry
ghost
by
beating
with
sticks
against
the
bark
sides
of
the
lodges
la
salle
and
his
companions
began
to
fear
for
their
own
safety
some
of
their
hosts
wished
to
kill
them
in
revenge
for
the
chief
murdered
near
montreal
and
as
these
and
others
were
at
times
in
a
frenzy
of
drunkenness
the
position
of
the
french
became
critical
they
suspected
that
means
had
been
used
to
prejudice
the
senecas
against
them
not
only
could
they
get
no
guides
but
they
were
told
that
if
they
went
to
the
ohio
the
tribes
of
those
parts
would
infallibly
kill
them
their
dutch
interpreter
became
disheartened
and
unmanageable
and
after
staying
a
month
at
the
village
the
hope
of
getting
farther
on
their
way
seemed
less
than
ever
their
plan
it
was
clear
must
be
changed
and
an
indian
from
otinawatawa
a
kind
of
iroquois
colony
at
the
head
of
lake
ontario
offered
to
guide
them
to
his
village
and
show
them
a
better
way
to
the
ohio
they
left
the
senecas
coasted
the
south
shore
of
the
lake
passed
the
mouth
of
the
niagara
where
they
heard
the
distant
roar
of
the
cataract
and
on
the
of
september
reached
otinawatawa
which
was
a
few
miles
north
of
the
present
town
of
hamilton
the
inhabitants
proved
friendly
and
la
salle
received
the
welcome
present
of
a
shawanoe
prisoner
who
told
them
that
the
ohio
could
be
reached
in
six
weeks
and
that
he
would
guide
them
to
it
delighted
at
this
good
fortune
they
were
about
to
set
out
when
they
heard
to
their
astonishment
of
the
arrival
of
two
other
frenchmen
at
a
neighboring
village
sidenote
louis
joliet
one
of
the
strangers
was
destined
to
hold
a
conspicuous
place
in
the
history
of
western
discovery
this
was
louis
joliet
a
young
man
of
about
the
age
of
la
salle
like
him
he
had
studied
for
the
priesthood
but
the
world
and
the
wilderness
had
conquered
his
early
inclinations
and
changed
him
to
an
active
and
adventurous
talon
had
sent
him
to
discover
and
explore
the
of
lake
superior
he
had
failed
in
the
attempt
and
was
now
returning
his
indian
guide
afraid
of
passing
the
niagara
portage
lest
he
should
meet
enemies
had
led
him
from
lake
erie
by
way
of
grand
river
towards
the
head
of
lake
ontario
and
thus
it
was
that
he
met
la
salle
and
the
sulpitians
this
meeting
caused
a
change
of
plan
joliet
showed
the
priests
a
map
which
he
had
made
of
such
parts
of
the
upper
lakes
as
he
had
visited
and
gave
them
a
copy
of
it
telling
them
at
the
same
time
of
the
pottawattamies
and
other
tribes
of
that
region
in
grievous
need
of
spiritual
succor
the
result
was
a
determination
on
their
part
to
follow
the
route
which
he
suggested
notwithstanding
the
remonstrances
of
la
salle
who
in
vain
reminded
them
that
the
jesuits
had
preoccupied
the
field
and
would
regard
them
as
intruders
they
resolved
that
the
pottawattamies
should
no
longer
sit
in
darkness
while
as
for
the
mississippi
it
could
be
reached
as
they
conceived
with
less
risk
by
this
northern
route
than
by
that
of
the
south
la
salle
was
of
a
different
mind
his
goal
was
the
ohio
and
not
the
northern
lakes
a
few
days
before
while
hunting
he
had
been
attacked
by
a
fever
sarcastically
ascribed
by
galinée
to
his
having
seen
three
large
crawling
up
a
rock
he
now
told
his
two
colleagues
that
he
was
in
no
condition
to
go
forward
and
should
be
forced
to
part
with
them
the
staple
of
la
salle
character
as
his
life
will
attest
was
an
invincible
determination
of
purpose
which
set
at
naught
all
risks
and
all
sufferings
he
had
cast
himself
with
all
his
resources
into
this
enterprise
and
while
his
faculties
remained
he
was
not
a
man
to
recoil
from
it
on
the
other
hand
the
masculine
fibre
of
which
he
was
made
did
not
always
withhold
him
from
the
practice
of
the
arts
of
address
and
the
use
of
what
dollier
de
casson
styles
he
respected
the
priesthood
with
the
exception
it
seems
of
the
jesuits
and
he
was
under
obligations
to
the
sulpitians
of
montreal
hence
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
used
his
illness
as
a
pretext
for
escaping
from
their
company
without
ungraciousness
and
following
his
own
path
in
his
own
way
sidenote
separation
on
the
last
day
of
september
the
priests
made
an
altar
supported
by
the
paddles
of
the
canoes
laid
on
forked
sticks
dollier
said
mass
la
salle
and
his
followers
received
the
sacrament
as
did
also
those
of
his
late
colleagues
and
thus
they
parted
the
sulpitians
and
their
party
descending
the
grand
river
towards
lake
erie
while
la
salle
as
they
supposed
began
his
return
to
montreal
what
course
he
actually
took
we
shall
soon
inquire
and
meanwhile
for
a
few
moments
we
will
follow
the
priests
when
they
reached
lake
erie
they
saw
it
tossing
like
an
angry
ocean
they
had
no
mind
to
tempt
the
dangerous
and
unknown
navigation
and
encamped
for
the
winter
in
the
forest
near
the
peninsula
called
the
long
point
here
they
gathered
a
good
store
of
chestnuts
plums
and
grapes
and
built
themselves
a
log
cabin
with
a
recess
at
the
end
for
an
altar
they
passed
the
winter
unmolested
shooting
game
in
abundance
and
saying
mass
three
times
a
week
early
in
spring
they
planted
a
large
cross
attached
to
it
the
arms
of
france
and
took
formal
possession
of
the
country
in
the
name
of
louis
xiv
this
done
they
resumed
their
voyage
and
after
many
troubles
landed
one
evening
in
a
state
of
exhaustion
on
or
near
point
pelée
towards
the
western
extremity
of
lake
erie
a
storm
rose
as
they
lay
asleep
and
swept
off
a
great
part
of
their
baggage
which
in
their
fatigue
they
had
left
at
the
edge
of
the
water
their
was
lost
with
the
rest
a
misfortune
which
they
ascribed
to
the
jealousy
and
malice
of
the
devil
debarred
henceforth
from
saying
mass
they
resolved
to
return
to
montreal
and
leave
the
pottawattamies
uninstructed
they
presently
entered
the
strait
by
which
lake
huron
joins
lake
erie
and
landing
near
where
detroit
now
stands
found
a
large
stone
somewhat
suggestive
of
the
human
figure
which
the
indians
had
bedaubed
with
paint
and
which
they
worshipped
as
a
manito
in
view
of
their
late
misfortune
this
device
of
the
excited
their
utmost
resentment
after
the
loss
of
our
writes
galinée
and
the
hunger
we
had
suffered
there
was
not
a
man
of
us
who
was
not
filled
with
hatred
against
this
false
deity
i
devoted
one
of
my
axes
to
breaking
him
in
pieces
and
then
having
fastened
our
canoes
side
by
side
we
carried
the
largest
piece
to
the
middle
of
the
river
and
threw
it
with
all
the
rest
into
the
water
that
he
might
never
be
heard
of
again
god
rewarded
us
immediately
for
this
good
action
for
we
killed
a
deer
and
a
bear
that
same
day
sidenote
at
ste
marie
du
saut
this
is
the
first
recorded
passage
of
white
men
through
the
strait
of
detroit
though
joliet
had
no
doubt
passed
this
way
on
his
return
from
the
upper
lakes
the
two
missionaries
took
this
course
with
the
intention
of
proceeding
to
the
saut
ste
marie
and
there
joining
the
ottawas
and
other
tribes
of
that
region
in
their
yearly
descent
to
montreal
they
issued
upon
lake
huron
followed
its
eastern
shores
till
they
reached
the
georgian
bay
near
the
head
of
which
the
jesuits
had
established
their
great
mission
of
the
hurons
destroyed
twenty
years
before
by
the
iroquois
and
ignoring
or
slighting
the
labors
of
the
rival
missionaries
held
their
way
northward
along
the
rocky
archipelago
that
edged
those
lonely
coasts
they
passed
the
manitoulins
and
ascending
the
strait
by
which
lake
superior
discharges
its
waters
arrived
on
the
of
may
at
ste
marie
du
saut
here
they
found
the
two
jesuits
dablon
and
marquette
in
a
square
fort
of
cedar
pickets
built
by
their
men
within
the
past
year
and
enclosing
a
chapel
and
a
house
near
by
they
had
cleared
a
large
tract
of
land
and
sown
it
with
wheat
indian
corn
peas
and
other
crops
the
were
graciously
received
and
invited
to
vespers
in
the
chapel
but
they
very
soon
found
la
salle
prediction
made
good
and
saw
that
the
jesuit
fathers
wanted
no
help
from
sulpice
galinée
on
his
part
takes
occasion
to
remark
that
though
the
jesuits
had
baptized
a
few
indians
at
the
saut
not
one
of
them
was
a
good
enough
christian
to
receive
the
eucharist
and
he
intimates
that
the
case
by
their
own
showing
was
still
worse
at
their
mission
of
esprit
the
two
sulpitians
did
not
care
to
prolong
their
stay
and
three
days
after
their
arrival
they
left
the
saut
not
as
they
expected
with
the
indians
but
with
a
french
guide
furnished
by
the
jesuits
ascending
french
river
to
lake
nipissing
they
crossed
to
the
waters
of
the
ottawa
and
descended
to
montreal
which
they
reached
on
the
eighteenth
of
june
they
had
made
no
discoveries
and
no
converts
but
galinée
after
his
arrival
made
the
earliest
map
of
the
upper
lakes
known
to
exist
sidenote
la
salle
discoveries
we
return
now
to
la
salle
only
to
find
ourselves
involved
in
mist
and
obscurity
what
did
he
do
after
he
left
the
two
priests
unfortunately
a
definite
answer
is
not
possible
and
the
next
two
years
of
his
life
remain
in
some
measure
an
enigma
that
he
was
busied
in
active
exploration
and
that
he
made
important
discoveries
is
certain
but
the
extent
and
character
of
these
discoveries
remain
wrapped
in
doubt
he
is
known
to
have
kept
journals
and
made
maps
and
these
were
in
existence
and
in
possession
of
his
niece
madeleine
cavelier
then
in
advanced
age
as
late
as
the
year
beyond
which
time
the
most
diligent
inquiry
has
failed
to
trace
them
abbé
faillon
affirms
that
some
of
la
salle
men
refusing
to
follow
him
returned
to
la
chine
and
that
the
place
then
received
its
name
in
derision
of
the
young
dream
of
a
westward
passage
to
china
as
for
himself
the
only
distinct
record
of
his
movements
is
that
contained
in
a
paper
entitled
histoire
de
monsieur
de
la
salle
it
is
an
account
of
his
explorations
and
of
the
state
of
parties
in
canada
previous
to
the
year
taken
from
the
lips
of
la
salle
himself
by
a
person
whose
name
does
not
appear
but
who
declares
that
he
had
ten
or
twelve
conversations
with
him
at
paris
whither
he
had
come
with
a
petition
to
the
court
the
writer
himself
had
never
been
in
america
and
was
ignorant
of
its
geography
hence
blunders
on
his
part
might
reasonably
be
expected
his
statements
however
are
in
some
measure
intelligible
and
the
following
is
the
substance
of
them
after
leaving
the
priests
la
salle
went
to
onondaga
where
we
are
left
to
infer
that
he
succeeded
better
in
getting
a
guide
than
he
had
before
done
among
the
senecas
thence
he
made
his
way
to
a
point
six
or
seven
leagues
distant
from
lake
erie
where
he
reached
a
branch
of
the
ohio
and
descending
it
followed
the
river
as
far
as
the
rapids
at
louisville
or
as
has
been
maintained
beyond
its
confluence
with
the
mississippi
his
men
now
refused
to
go
farther
and
abandoned
him
escaping
to
the
english
and
the
dutch
whereupon
he
retraced
his
steps
alone
this
must
have
been
in
the
winter
of
or
in
the
following
spring
unless
there
is
an
error
of
date
in
the
statement
of
nicolas
perrot
the
famous
who
says
that
he
met
him
in
the
summer
of
hunting
on
the
ottawa
with
a
party
of
iroquois
sidenote
the
river
illinois
but
how
was
la
salle
employed
in
the
following
year
the
same
memoir
has
its
solution
to
the
problem
by
this
it
appears
that
the
indefatigable
explorer
embarked
on
lake
erie
ascended
the
detroit
to
lake
huron
coasted
the
unknown
shores
of
michigan
passed
the
straits
of
michilimackinac
and
leaving
green
bay
behind
him
entered
what
is
described
as
an
incomparably
larger
bay
but
which
was
evidently
the
southern
portion
of
lake
michigan
thence
he
crossed
to
a
river
flowing
westward
evidently
the
illinois
and
followed
it
until
it
was
joined
by
another
river
flowing
from
the
northwest
to
the
southeast
by
this
the
mississippi
only
can
be
meant
and
he
is
reported
to
have
said
that
he
descended
it
to
the
degree
of
latitude
where
he
stopped
assured
that
it
discharged
itself
not
into
the
gulf
of
california
but
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
resolved
to
follow
it
thither
at
a
future
day
when
better
provided
with
men
and
supplies
sidenote
the
mississippi
the
first
of
these
statements
that
relating
to
the
ohio
confused
vague
and
in
great
part
incorrect
as
it
certainly
is
is
nevertheless
well
sustained
as
regards
one
essential
point
la
salle
himself
in
a
memorial
addressed
to
count
frontenac
in
affirms
that
he
discovered
the
ohio
and
descended
it
as
far
as
to
a
fall
which
obstructed
it
again
his
rival
louis
joliet
whose
testimony
on
this
point
can
not
be
suspected
made
two
maps
of
the
region
of
the
mississippi
and
the
great
lakes
the
ohio
is
laid
down
on
both
of
them
with
an
inscription
to
the
effect
that
it
had
been
explored
by
la
salle
that
he
discovered
the
ohio
may
then
be
regarded
as
established
that
he
descended
it
to
the
mississippi
he
himself
does
not
pretend
nor
is
there
reason
to
believe
that
he
did
so
with
regard
to
his
alleged
voyage
down
the
illinois
the
case
is
different
here
he
is
reported
to
have
made
a
statement
which
admits
but
one
interpretation
that
of
the
discovery
by
him
of
the
mississippi
prior
to
its
discovery
by
joliet
and
marquette
this
statement
is
attributed
to
a
man
not
prone
to
vaunt
his
own
exploits
who
never
proclaimed
them
in
print
and
whose
testimony
even
in
his
own
case
must
therefore
have
weight
but
it
comes
to
us
through
the
medium
of
a
person
strongly
biassed
in
favor
of
la
salle
and
against
marquette
and
the
jesuits
sidenote
la
salle
discoveries
seven
years
had
passed
since
the
alleged
discovery
and
la
salle
had
not
before
laid
claim
to
it
although
it
was
matter
of
notoriety
that
during
five
years
it
had
been
claimed
by
joliet
and
that
his
claim
was
generally
admitted
the
correspondence
of
the
governor
and
the
intendant
is
silent
as
to
la
salle
having
penetrated
to
the
mississippi
though
the
attempt
was
made
under
the
auspices
of
the
latter
as
his
own
letters
declare
while
both
had
the
discovery
of
the
great
river
earnestly
at
heart
the
governor
frontenac
la
salle
ardent
supporter
and
ally
believed
in
as
his
letters
show
that
the
mississippi
flowed
into
the
gulf
of
california
and
two
years
later
he
announces
to
the
minister
colbert
its
discovery
by
joliet
after
la
death
his
brother
his
nephew
and
his
niece
addressed
a
memorial
to
the
king
petitioning
for
certain
grants
in
consideration
of
the
discoveries
of
their
relative
which
they
specify
at
some
length
but
they
do
not
pretend
that
he
reached
the
mississippi
before
his
expeditions
of
to
this
silence
is
the
more
significant
as
it
is
this
very
niece
who
had
possession
of
the
papers
in
which
la
salle
recounts
the
journeys
of
which
the
issues
are
in
question
had
they
led
him
to
the
mississippi
it
is
reasonably
certain
that
she
would
have
made
it
known
in
her
memorial
la
salle
discovered
the
ohio
and
in
all
probability
the
illinois
also
but
that
he
discovered
the
mississippi
has
not
been
proved
nor
in
the
light
of
the
evidence
we
have
is
it
likely

to
have

the

may
have

the

by
an
easy

he
might
have
reached
the

in

that

the

will
be

incorrect

obscure

her

lived
with
the
of
saints
and
died
with
the
devotion
of

and
the
result
of
all
had
been
a
disastrous
failure
from
no
on
their
part
but
from
the
force
of
events
beyond
the
sphere
of
their
influence
a
very
demon
of
havoc
had
crushed
their
incipient
churches
slaughtered
their
converts
uprooted
the
populous
communities
on
which
their
hopes
had
rested
and
scattered
them
in
bands
of
wretched
fugitives
far
and
wide
through
the
wilderness
they
had
devoted
themselves
in
the
fulness
of
faith
to
the
building
up
of
a
christian
and
jesuit
empire
on
the
conversion
of
the
great
stationary
tribes
of
the
lakes
and
of
these
none
remained
but
the
iroquois
the
destroyers
of
the
rest
among
whom
indeed
was
a
field
which
might
stimulate
their
zeal
by
an
abundant
promise
of
sufferings
and
martyrdoms
but
which
from
its
geographical
position
was
too
much
exposed
to
dutch
and
english
influence
to
promise
great
and
decisive
results
their
best
hopes
were
now
in
the
north
and
the
west
and
thither
in
great
part
they
had
turned
their
energies

in

spirit
not
quite

the

we
find

and
the
secrets
whereof
with
the
help
of
the
virgin
we
will
soon
reveal
to
the
world
the
jesuit
was
as
often
a
fanatic
for
his
order
as
for
his
faith
and
oftener
yet
the
two
fanaticisms
mingled
in
him
inextricably
ardently
as
he
burned
for
the
saving
of
souls
he
would
have
none
saved
on
the
upper
lakes
except
by
his
brethren
and
himself
he
claimed
a
monopoly
of
conversion
with
its
attendant
monopoly
of
toil
hardship
and
martyrdom
often
disinterested
for
himself
he
was
inordinately
ambitious
for
the
great
corporate
power
in
which
he
had
merged
his
own
personality

were

were
in
a

sense
the
parents
of

one
of
these
was
ste

the

visited
by
dollier
and
galinée
at
the
outlet
of

superior
this
was
a
noted
for
the
rapids
were
full
of
and
indians
came
thither
in
crowds
the
permanent
residents
were
an
ojibwa
band
whom
the
french
called
sauteurs
and
whose
bark
lodges
were
clustered
at
the
foot
of
the
rapids
near
the
fort
of
the
jesuits
besides
these
a
host
of
algonquins
of
various
tribes
resorted
thither
in
the
spring

living
in
abundance
on
the
fishery
and
dispersing
in
winter
to
wander
and
starve

other
chief
mission
was
that

here
were
the

fugitives
twenty
years
before
from
the
slaughter
of

lately
arrived
from

his
savage

disheartened
him
by
its
backslidings
and
the
best
that
he
could
report
of
the
hurons
after
all
the
toil
and
all
the
blood
lavished
in
their
conversion
was
that
they
still
retain
a
little
christianity
while
the
ottawas
are
far
removed
from
the
kingdom
of
god
and
addicted
beyond
all
other
tribes
to
foulness
incantations
and
sacrifices
to
evil
spirits
sidenote

marquette
heard
from
the
illinois
yearly
visitors
at
la

of
the
great
river
which
they
had
crossed
on
their
way
and
which
as
he
conjectured
flowed
into
the
gulf
of
california
he
heard
marvels
of
it
also
from
the
sioux
who
lived
on
its
banks
and
a
strong
desire
possessed
him
to
explore
the
mystery
of
its
course
a
sudden
calamity
dashed
his
hopes
the
sioux
the
iroquois
of
the
west
as
the
jesuits
call
them
had
hitherto
kept
the
peace
with
the
expatriated
tribes
of
la
pointe
but
now
from
some
cause
not
worth
inquiry
they
broke
into
open
war
and
so
terrified
the
hurons
and
ottawas
that
they
abandoned
their
settlements
and
fled
marquette
followed
his
flock
who
passing
the
saut

stopped
at

utter
solitude

denizens
by
the
terror
of

but
now
that
these

had
felt
the
power
of
the
french
and
learned
for
a
time
to
leave
their
indian
allies
in

the
fugitive
hordes
were
returning
to
their
ancient
abodes
andré
experience
among
them
was
of
the
roughest
the
staple
of

diet
was
acorns

being
boiled
resolved
itself
into
a
black

his
portion
when

and
unabated
zeal
sidenote
the
green

mission
besides
the
saut
ste

and
michilimackinac
both
noted
there
was
another
spot
no
less
famous
for
game
and
fish
and
therefore
a
favorite
resort
of
indians
this
was
the
head
of
the
green
bay
of
lake
michigan
here
and
in
adjacent
districts
several
distinct
tribes
had
made
their
abode
the
menomonies
were
on
the
river
which
bears
their
name
the

were
near
the
borders
of
the
bay
the
sacs
on
fox
river
the
mascoutins

on
the

above

winnebago
and
the
outagamies
or
foxes
on
a
tributary
of
it
flowing
from
the
north
green
bay
was
manifestly
suited
for
a
mission
and
as
early
as
the
autumn
of
father
claude
allouez
was
sent
thither
to
found
one
after
nearly
perishing
by
the
way
he
set
out
to
explore
the
destined
field
of
his
labors

went
as
far
as
the
town
of

mascoutins

in
the
autumn
of
having
been
joined
by
dablon
superior
of
the
missions
on
the
upper
lakes
he
made
another
journey
but
not
until
the
two
fathers
had
held
a
council
with
the
congregated
tribes
at
françois
xavier
for
so
they
named
their
mission
of
green
bay
here
as
they
harangued
their
naked
audience
their
gravity
was
put
to
the
proof
for
a
band
of
warriors
anxious
to
do
them
honor
walked
incessantly
up
and
down
aping
the
movements
of
the
soldiers
on
guard
before
the
tent
at
montreal
we
could
hardly
keep
from
laughing
writes
dablon
though
we
were
discoursing
on
very
important
subjects
namely
the
mysteries
of
our
religion
and
the
things
necessary
to
escaping
from
eternal
fire
the
fathers
were
delighted
with
the
country
which
dablon
calls
an
earthly
paradise
but
he
adds
that
the
way
to
it
is
as
hard
as
the
path
to
heaven
he
alludes
especially
to
the
rapids
of
fox
river
which
gave
the
two
travellers
great
trouble
having
safely
passed
them
they
saw
an
indian
idol
on
the
bank
similar
to
that
which
dollier
and
galinée
found
at
detroit
being
merely
a
rock
bearing
some
resemblance
to
a
man
and
hideously
painted
with
the
help
of
their
attendants
they
threw
it
into
the
river
dablon
expatiates
on
the
buffalo
which
he
describes
apparently
on
the
report
of
others
as
his
description
is
not
very
accurate
crossing

the
two
priests
followed
the
river
leading
to
the
town
of
the
mascoutins
and
miamis
which
they
reached
on
the
fifteenth
of
september
these
two
tribes
lived
together
within
the
compass
of
the
same
enclosure
of
palisades
to
the
number
it
is
said
of
more
than
three
thousand
souls
the
missionaries
who
had
brought
a
highly
colored
picture
of
the
last
judgment
called
the
indians
to
council
and
displayed
it
before
them
while
allouez
who
spoke
algonquin
harangued
them
on
hell
demons
and
eternal
flames
they
listened
with
open
ears
beset
him
night
and
day
with
questions
and
invited
him
and
his
companion
to
unceasing
feasts
they
were
welcomed
in
every
lodge
and
followed
everywhere
with
eyes
of
curiosity
wonder
and
awe
dablon
overflows
with
praises
of
the
miami
chief
who
was
honored
by
his
subjects
like
a
king
and
whose
demeanor
towards
his
guests
had
no
savor
of
the
savage
their
hosts
told
them
of
the
great
river
mississippi
rising
far
in
the
north
and
flowing
southward
they
knew
not
whither
and
of
many
tribes
that
dwelt
along
its
banks
when
at
length
they
took
their
departure
they
left
behind
them
a
reputation
as
of
transcendent
power
sidenote
the
cross
among
the
foxes
in
the
winter
following
allouez
visited
the
foxes
whom
he
found
in
extreme
they
were
incensed
against
the
french
by
the
which
some
of
their
tribe
had
lately
met
when
on
a
trading
visit
to
montreal
and
they
received
the
faith
with
shouts
of
derision
the
priest
was
at
what
he
saw
their
lodges
each
containing
from
five
to
ten
families
seemed
in
his
eyes
like
seraglios
for
some
of
the
chiefs
had
eight
wives
he
armed
himself
with
patience
and
at
length
gained
a
hearing
nay
he
succeeded
so
well
that
when
he
showed
them
his
crucifix
they
would
throw
tobacco
on
it
as
an
offering
and
on
another
visit
which
he
made
them
soon
after
he
taught
the
whole
village
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross

going
out
against
their
enemies
and
he
bethought
him
of
telling
them
the
story
of
the
cross
and
the
emperor
constantine
this
so
wrought
upon
them
that
they
all
daubed
the
figure
of
a
cross
on
their
shields
of
set
out
for
the
war
and
came
back
victorious
extolling
the
sacred
symbol
as
a
great
thus
it
is
writes
dablon
who
chronicles
the
incident
that
our
holy
faith
is
established
among
these
people
and
we
have
good
hope
that
we
shall
soon
carry
it
to
the
famous
river
called
the
mississippi
and
perhaps
even
to
the
south
sea
most
things
human
have
their
phases
of
the
ludicrous
and
the
heroism
of
these
untiring
priests
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
sidenote
trading
with
indians
the
various
missionary
stations
were
much
alike
they
consisted
of
a
chapel
commonly
of
logs
and
one
or
more
houses
with
perhaps
a
and
a
workshop
the
whole
fenced
with
palisades
and
forming
in
fact
a
stockade
fort
surrounded
with
clearings
and
cultivated
fields
it
is
evident
that
the
priests
had
need
of
other
hands
than
their
own
and
those
of
the
few

so

admitted

he
complains
that
the
indians
were
very
averse
to
giving
information
on
the
subject
so
that
the
jesuits
had
not
as
yet
discovered
the
metal
though
they
hoped
soon
to
do
so
the
indians
told
him
that
the
copper
had
first
been
found
by
four
hunters
who
had
landed
on
a
certain
island
near
the
north
shore
of

wishing
to
boil
their
food
in

vessel
of

they
gathered
stones
on

shore
heated
them

hot
and
threw
them
in

presently
discovered
them
to
be
pure
copper
their

over
they
hastened
to
being
afraid
of
the
lynxes
and
the
hares
which
on
this
island
were
as
large
as

and
which
would
have
devoured
their
provisions
and
perhaps
their
canoe
they
took
with
them
some
of
the
wonderful
stones
but
scarcely
had
they
left

when
a
deep
voice
like
thunder
sounded
in

thieves
who
steal

it

retreated

three
of

soon
died

long

to
reach

from
attempting
so
long
a

lest
the
fatigue
incident
to

nothing

sidenote
allouez
harangue
when
the
uproar
was
over
father
allouez
addressed
the
indians
in
a
solemn
harangue
and
these
were
his
words
it
is
a
good
work
my
brothers
an
important
work
a
great
work
that
brings
us
together
in
council
look
up
at
the
cross
which
rises
so
high
above
your
heads
it
was
there
that
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
after
making
himself
a
man
for
the
love
of
men
was
nailed
and
died
to
satisfy
his
eternal
father
for
our
sins
he
is
the
master
of
our
lives
the
ruler
of
heaven
earth
and
hell
it
is
he
of
whom
i
am
continually
speaking
to
you
and
whose
name
and
word
i
have
borne
through
all
your
country
but
look
at
this
post
to
which
are
fixed
the
arms
of
the
great
chief
of
france
whom
we
call
king
he
lives
across
the
sea
he
is
the
chief
of
the
greatest
chiefs
and
has
no
equal
on
earth
all
the
chiefs
whom
you
have
ever
seen
are
but
children
beside
him
he
is
like
a
great
tree
and
they
are
but
the
little
herbs
that
one
walks
over
and
tramples
under
foot
you
know
onontio
that
famous
chief
at
quebec
you
know
and
you
have
seen
that
he
is
the
terror
of
the
iroquois
and
that
his
very
name
makes
them
tremble
since
he
has
laid
their
country
waste
and
burned
their
towns
with
fire
across
the
sea
there
are
ten
thousand
onontios
like
him
who
are
but
the
warriors
of
our
great
king
of
whom
i
have
told
you
when
he
says
am
going
to
war
everybody
obeys
his
orders
and
each
of
these
ten
thousand
chiefs
raises
a
troop
of
a
hundred
warriors
some
on
sea
and
some
on
land
some
embark
in
great
ships
such
as
you
have
seen
at
quebec
your
canoes
carry
only
four
or
five
men
or
at
the
most
ten
or
twelve
but
our
ships
carry
four
or
five
hundred
and
sometimes
a
thousand
others
go
to
war
by
land
and
in
such
numbers
that
if
they
stood
in
a
double
file
they
would
reach
from
here
to
mississaquenk
which
is
more
than
twenty
leagues
off
when
our
king
attacks
his
enemies
he
is
more
terrible
than
the
thunder
the
earth
trembles
the
air
and
the
sea
are
all
on
fire
with
the
blaze
of
his
cannon
he
is
seen
in
the
midst
of
his
warriors
covered
over
with
the
blood
of
his
enemies
whom
he
kills
in
such
numbers
that
he
does
not
reckon
them
by
the
scalps
but
by
the
streams
of
blood
which
he
causes
to
flow
he
takes
so
many
prisoners
that
he
holds
them
in
no
account
but
lets
them
go
where
they
will
to
show
that
he
is
not
afraid
of
them
but
now
nobody
dares
make
war
on
him
all
the
nations
beyond
the
sea
have
submitted
to
him
and
begged
humbly
for
peace
men
come
from
every
quarter
of
the
earth
to
listen
to
him
and
admire
him
all
that
is
done
in
the
world
is
decided
by
him
alone
but
what
shall
i
say
of
his
riches
you
think
yourselves
rich
when
you
have
ten
or
twelve
sacks
of
corn
a
few
hatchets
beads
kettles
and
other
things
of
that
sort
he
has
cities
of
his
own
more
than
there
are
of
men
in
all
this
country
for
five
hundred
leagues
around
in
each
city
there
are
where
there
are
hatchets
enough
to
cut
down
all
your
forests
kettles
enough
to
cook
all
your
moose
and
beads
enough
to
fill
all
your
lodges
his
house
is
longer
than
from
here
to
the
top
of
the
saut
that
is
to
say
more
than
half
a
league
and
higher
than
your
tallest
trees
and
it
holds
more
families
than
the
largest
of
your
towns
the
father
added
more
in
a
similar
strain
but
the
peroration
of
his
harangue
is
not
on
record
whatever
impression
this
curious
effort
of
jesuit
rhetoric
may
have
produced
upon
the
hearers
it
did
not
prevent
them
from
stripping
the
royal
arms
from
the
post
to
which
they
were
nailed
as
soon
as
and
his
men
had
left
the
saut
probably
not
because
they
understood
the
import
of
the
symbol
but
because
they
feared
it
as
a
charm
proceeded
to
lake
superior
where
however
he
accomplished
nothing
except
perhaps
a
traffic
with
the
indians
on
his
own
account
and
he
soon
after
returned
to
quebec
talon
was
resolved
to
find
the
mississippi
the
most
interesting
object
of
search
and
seemingly
the
most
attainable
in
the
wild
and
vague
domain
which
he
had
just
claimed
for
the
king
the
indians
had
described
it
the
jesuits
were
eager
to
discover
it
and
la
salle
if
he
had
not
reached
it
had
explored
two
several
avenues
by
which
it
might
be
approached
talon
looked
about
him
for
a
fit
agent
of
the
enterprise
and
made
choice
of
louis
joliet
who
had
returned
from
lake
superior
but
the
intendant
was
not
to
see
the
fulfilment
of
his
design
his
busy
and
useful
career
in
canada
was
drawing
to
an
end
a
misunderstanding
had
arisen
between
him
and
the
governor
courcelle
both
were
faithful
servants
of
the
king
but
the
relations
between
the
two
chiefs
of
the
colony
were
of
a
nature
necessarily
so
critical
that
a
conflict
of
authority
was
scarcely
to
be
avoided

young

there
is
nothing
that
reveals
any
salient
or
distinctive
trait
of
character
any
especial
breadth
of

or
boldness
of

he
appears
to
have
been
simply
a
merchant
intelligent
well
educated
courageous
hardy
and
enterprising
though
he
had
renounced
the
priesthood
he
retained
his
partiality
for
the
jesuits
and
it
is
more
than
probable
that
their
influence
had
aided
not
a
little
to
determine

choice
one
of

number
jacques
marquette
was
chosen
to
accompany
him
sidenote
marquette
he
passed
up
the
lakes
to
michilimackinac
and
found
his
destined
companion
at
point
ignace
on
the
north
side
of
the
strait
where
in
his
palisaded
and
chapel
he
had
labored
for
two
years
past
to
instruct
the
huron
refugees
from
esprit
and
a
band
of
ottawas
who
had
joined
them
marquette
was
born
in
of
an
old
and
honorable
family
at
laon
in
the
north
of
france
and
was
now
years
of
age
when
about
seventeen
he
had
joined
the
jesuits
evidently
from
motives
purely
religious
and
in
he
was
sent
to
the
missions
of
canada
at
first
he
was
destined
to
the
station
of
tadoussac
and
to
prepare
himself
for
it
he
studied
the
montagnais
language
under
gabriel
druilletes
but
his
destination
was
changed
and
he
was
sent
to
the
upper
lakes
in
where
he
had
since
remained
his
talents
as
a
linguist
must
have
been
great
for
within
a
few
years
he
learned
to
speak
with
ease
six
indian
languages
the
traits
of
his
character
are
unmistakable
he
was
of
the
brotherhood
of
the
early
canadian
missionaries
and
the
true
counterpart
of
garnier
or
jogues
he
was
a
devout
votary
of
the
virgin
mary
who
imaged
to
his
mind
in
shapes
of
the
most
transcendent
loveliness
with
which
the
pencil
of
human
genius
has
ever
informed
the
canvas
was
to
him
the
object
of
an
adoration
not
unmingled
with
a
sentiment
of
chivalrous
devotion
the
longings
of
a
sensitive
heart
divorced
from
earth
sought
solace
in
the
skies
a
subtile
element
of
romance
was
blended
with
the
fervor
of
his
worship
and
hung
like
an
illumined
cloud
over
the
harsh
and
hard
realities
of
his
daily
lot
kindled
by
the
smile
of
his
celestial
mistress
his
gentle
and
noble
nature
knew
no
fear
for
her
he
burned
to
dare
and
to
suffer
discover
new
lands
and
conquer
new
realms
to
her
sway
he
begins
the
journal
of
his
voyage
thus
the
day
of
the
immaculate
conception
of
the
holy
virgin
whom
i
had
continually
invoked
since
i
came
to
this
country
of
the
ottawas
to
obtain
from
god
the
favor
of
being
enabled
to
visit
the
nations
on
the
river
mississippi
this
very
day
was
precisely
that
on
which
joliet
arrived
with
orders
from
count
frontenac
our
governor
and
from
talon
our
intendant
to
go
with
me
on
this
discovery
i
was
all
the
more
delighted
at
this
good
news
because
i
saw
my
plans
about
to
be
accomplished
and
found
myself
in
the
happy
necessity
of
exposing
my
life
for
the
salvation
of
all
these
tribes
and
especially
of
the
illinois
who
when
i
was
at
point
esprit
had
begged
me
very
earnestly
to
bring
the
word
of
god
among
them
sidenote
departure
the
outfit
of
the
travellers
was
very
simple
they
provided
themselves
with
two
birch
canoes
and
a
supply
of
smoked
meat
and
indian
corn
embarked
with
five
men
and
began
their
voyage
on
the
seventeenth
of
may
they
had
obtained
all
possible
information
from
the
indians
and
had
made
by
means
of
it
a
species
of
map
of
their
intended
route
above
all
writes
marquette
i
placed
our
voyage
under
the
protection
of
the
holy
virgin
immaculate
promising
that
if
she
granted
us
the
favor
of
discovering
the
great
river
i
would
give
it
the
name
of
the
conception
their
course
was
westward
and
plying
their
paddles
they
passed
the
straits
of
michilimackinac
and
coasted
the
northern
shores
of
lake
michigan
landing
at
evening
to
build
their
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
draw
up
their
canoes
on
the
strand
they
soon
reached
the
river
menomonie
and
ascended
it
to
the
village
of
the
menomonies
or
indians
when
they
told
them
the
object
of
their
voyage
they
were
filled
with
astonishment
and
used
their
best
ingenuity
to
dissuade
them
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
they
said
were
inhabited
by
ferocious
tribes
who
put
every
stranger
to
death
tomahawking
all
without
cause
or
provocation
they
added
that
there
was
a
demon
in
a
certain
part
of
the
river
whose
roar
could
be
heard
at
a
great
distance
and
who
would
engulf
them
in
the
abyss
where
he
dwelt
that
its
waters
were
full
of
frightful
monsters
who
would
devour
them
and
their
canoe
and
finally
that
the
heat
was
so
great
that
they
would
perish
inevitably
marquette
set
their
counsel
at
naught
gave
them
a
few
words
of
instruction
in
the
mysteries
of
the
faith
taught
them
a
prayer
and
bade
them
farewell
the
travellers
next
reached
the
mission
at
the
head
of
green
bay
entered
fox
river
with
difficulty
and
labor
dragged
their
canoes
up
the
long
and
tumultuous
rapids
crossed
lake
winnebago
and
followed
the
quiet
windings
of
the
river
beyond
where
they
glided
through
an
endless
growth
of
wild
rice
and
scared
the
innumerable
birds
that
fed
upon
it
on
either
hand
rolled
the
prairie
dotted
with
groves
and
trees
browsing
elk
and
deer
on
the
seventh
of
june
they
reached
the
mascoutins
and
miamis
who
since
the
visit
of
dablon
and
allouez
had
been
joined
by
the
kickapoos
marquette
who
had
an
eye
for
natural
beauty
was
delighted
with
the
situation
of
the
town
which
he
describes
as
standing
on
the
crown
of
a
hill
while
all
around
the
prairie
stretched
beyond
the
sight
interspersed
with
groves
and
belts
of
tall
forest
but
he
was
still
more
delighted
when
he
saw
a
cross
planted
in
the
midst
of
the
place
the
indians
had
decorated
it
with
a
number
of
dressed
red
girdles
and
bows
and
arrows
which
they
had
hung
upon
it
as
an
offering
to
the
great
manitou
of
the
french
a
sight
by
which
marquette
says
he
was
extremely
consoled
sidenote
the
wisconsin
river
the
travellers
had
no
sooner
reached
the
town
than
they
called
the
chiefs
and
elders
to
a
council
joliet
told
them
that
the
governor
of
canada
had
sent
him
to
discover
new
countries
and
that
god
had
sent
his
companion
to
teach
the
true
faith
to
the
inhabitants
and
he
prayed
for
guides
to
show
them
the
way
to
the
waters
of
the
wisconsin
the
council
readily
consented
and
on
the
tenth
of
june
the
frenchmen
embarked
again
with
two
indians
to
conduct
them
all
the
town
came
down
to
the
shore
to
see
their
departure
here
were
the
miamis
with
long
locks
of
hair
dangling
over
each
ear
after
a
fashion
which
marquette
thought
very
becoming
and
here
too
the
mascoutins
and
the
kickapoos
whom
he
describes
as
mere
boors
in
comparison
with
their
miami
townsmen
all
stared
alike
at
the
seven
adventurers
marvelling
that
men
could
be
found
to
risk
an
enterprise
so
hazardous
the
river
twisted
among
lakes
and
marshes
choked
with
wild
rice
and
but
for
their
guides
they
could
scarcely
have
followed
the
perplexed
and
narrow
channel
it
brought
them
at
last
to
the
portage
where
after
carrying
their
canoes
a
mile
and
a
half
over
the
prairie
and
through
the
marsh
they
launched
them
on
the
wisconsin
bade
farewell
to
the
waters
that
flowed
to
the
lawrence
and
committed
themselves
to
the
current
that
was
to
bear
them
they
knew
not
whither
perhaps
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
perhaps
to
the
south
sea
or
the
gulf
of
california
they
glided
calmly
down
the
tranquil
stream
by
islands
choked
with
trees
and
matted
with
entangling
by
forests
groves
and
prairies
the
parks
and
of
a
prodigal
nature
by
thickets
and
marshes
and
broad
bare
under
the
shadowing
trees
between
whose
tops
looked
down
from
afar
the
bold
brow
of
some
woody
bluff
at
night
the
bivouac
the
canoes
inverted
on
the
bank
the
flickering
fire
the
meal
of
or
venison
the
evening
pipes
and
slumber
beneath
the
stars
and
when
in
the
morning
they
embarked
again
the
mist
hung
on
the
river
like
a
bridal
veil
then
melted
before
the
sun
till
the
glassy
water
and
the
languid
woods
basked
breathless
in
the
sultry
glare
sidenote
the
mississippi
on
the
seventeenth
of
june
they
saw
on
their
right
the
broad
meadows
bounded
in
the
distance
by
rugged
hills
where
now
stand
the
town
and
fort
of
prairie
du
chien
before
them
a
wide
and
rapid
current
coursed
athwart
their
way
by
the
foot
of
lofty
heights
wrapped
thick
in
forests
they
had
found
what
they
sought
and
with
a
joy
writes
marquette
which
i
can
not
express
they
steered
forth
their
canoes
on
the
eddies
of
the
mississippi
turning
southward
they
paddled
down
the
stream
through
a
solitude
unrelieved
by
the
faintest
trace
of
man
a
large
fish
apparently
one
of
the
huge
of
the
mississippi
blundered
against
canoe
with
a
force
which
seems
to
have
startled
him
and
once
as
they
drew
in
their
net
they
caught
a
whose
eccentric
appearance
greatly
astonished
them
at
length
the
buffalo
began
to
appear
grazing
in
herds
on
the
great
prairies
which
then
bordered
the
river
and
marquette
describes
the
fierce
and
stupid
look
of
the
old
bulls
as
they
stared
at
the
intruders
through
the
tangled
mane
which
nearly
blinded
them
sidenote
the
illinois
indians
they
advanced
with
extreme
caution
landed
at
night
and
made
a
fire
to
cook
their
evening
meal
then
extinguished
it
embarked
again
paddled
some
way
farther
and
anchored
in
the
stream
keeping
a
man
on
the
watch
till
morning
they
had
journeyed
more
than
a
fortnight
without
meeting
a
human
being
when
on
the
they
discovered
footprints
of
men
in
the
mud
of
the
western
bank
and
a
path
that
led
to
the
adjacent
prairie
joliet
and
marquette
resolved
to
follow
it
and
leaving
the
canoes
in
charge
of
their
men
they
set
out
on
their
hazardous
adventure
the
day
was
fair
and
they
walked
two
leagues
in
silence
following
the
path
through
the
forest
and
across
the
sunny
prairie
till
they
discovered
an
indian
village
on
the
banks
of
a
river
and
two
others
on
a
hill
half
a
league
distant
now
with
beating
hearts
they
invoked
the
aid
of
heaven
and
again
advancing
came
so
near
without
being
seen
that
they
could
hear
the
voices
of
the
indians
among
the
wigwams
then
they
stood
forth
in
full
view
and
shouted
to
attract
attention
there
was
great
commotion
in
the
village
the
inmates
swarmed
out
of
their
huts
and
four
of
their
chief
men
presently
came
forward
to
meet
the
strangers
advancing
very
deliberately
and
holding
up
toward
the
sun
two
calumets
or
decorated
with
feathers
they
stopped
abruptly
before
the
two
frenchmen
and
stood
gazing
at
them
without
speaking
a
word
marquette
was
much
relieved
on
seeing
that
they
wore
french
cloth
whence
he
judged
that
they
must
be
friends
and
allies
he
broke
the
silence
and
asked
them
who
they
were
whereupon
they
answered
that
they
were
illinois
and
offered
the
pipe
which
having
been
duly
smoked
they
all
went
together
to
the
village
here
the
chief
received
the
travellers
after
a
singular
fashion
meant
to
do
them
honor
he
stood
stark
naked
at
the
door
of
a
large
wigwam
holding
up
both
hands
as
if
to
shield
his
eyes
frenchmen
how
bright
the
sun
shines
when
you
come
to
visit
us
all
our
village
awaits
you
and
you
shall
enter
our
wigwams
in
peace
so
saying
he
led
them
into
his
own
which
was
crowded
to
suffocation
with
savages
staring
at
their
guests
in
silence
having
smoked
with
the
chiefs
and
old
men
they
were
invited
to
visit
the
great
chief
of
all
the
illinois
at
one
of
the
villages
they
had
seen
in
the
distance
and
thither
they
proceeded
followed
by
a
throng
of
warriors
squaws
and
children
on
arriving
they
were
forced
to
smoke
again
and
listen
to
a
speech
of
welcome
from
the
great
chief
who
delivered
it
standing
between
two
old
men
naked
like
himself
his
lodge
was
crowded
with
the
dignitaries
of
the
tribe
whom
marquette
addressed
in
algonquin
announcing
himself
as
a
messenger
sent
by
the
god
who
had
made
them
and
whom
it
behooves
them
to
recognize
and
obey
he
added
a
few
words
touching
the
power
and
glory
of
count
frontenac
and
concluded
by
asking
information
concerning
the
mississippi
and
the
tribes
along
its
banks
whom
he
was
on
his
way
to
visit
the
chief
replied
with
a
speech
of
compliment
assuring
his
guests
that
their
presence
added
flavor
to
his
tobacco
made
the
river
more
calm
the
sky
more
serene
and
the
earth
more
beautiful
in
conclusion
he
gave
them
a
young
slave
and
a
calumet
begging
them
at
the
same
time
to
abandon
their
purpose
of
descending
the
mississippi
a
feast
of
four
courses
now
followed
first
a
wooden
bowl
full
of
a
porridge
of
indian
meal
boiled
with
grease
was
set
before
the
guests
and
the
master
of
ceremonies
fed
them
in
turn
like
infants
with
a
large
spoon
then
appeared
a
platter
of
fish
and
the
same
functionary
carefully
removing
the
bones
with
his
fingers
and
blowing
on
the
morsels
to
cool
them
placed
them
in
the
mouths
of
the
two
frenchmen
a
large
dog
killed
and
cooked
for
the
occasion
was
next
placed
before
them
but
failing
to
tempt
their
fastidious
appetites
was
supplanted
by
a
dish
of
fat
which
concluded
the
entertainment
the
crowd
having
dispersed
were
spread
on
the
ground
and
marquette
and
joliet
spent
the
night
on
the
scene
of
the
late
festivity
in
the
morning
the
chief
with
some
six
hundred
of
his
tribesmen
escorted
them
to
their
canoes
and
bade
them
after
their
stolid
fashion
a
friendly
farewell
sidenote
a
real
danger
again
they
were
on
their
way
slowly
drifting
down
the
great
river
they
passed
the
mouth
of
the
illinois
and
glided
beneath
that
line
of
rocks
on
the
eastern
side
cut
into
fantastic
forms
by
the
elements
and
marked
as
the
ruined
castles
on
some
of
the
early
french
maps
presently
they
beheld
a
sight
which
reminded
them
that
the
devil
was
still
lord
paramount
of
this
wilderness
on
the
flat
face
of
a
high
rock
were
painted
in
red
black
and
green
a
pair
of
monsters
each
as
large
as
a
calf
with
horns
like
a
deer
red
eyes
a
beard
like
a
tiger
and
a
frightful
expression
of
countenance
the
face
is
something
like
that
of
a
man
the
body
covered
with
scales
and
the
tail
so
long
that
it
passes
entirely
round
the
body
over
the
head
and
between
the
legs
ending
like
that
of
a
fish
such
is
the
account
which
the
worthy
jesuit
gives
of
these
manitous
or
indian
gods
he
confesses
that
at
first
they
frightened
him
and
his
imagination
and
that
of
his
credulous
companions
was
so
wrought
upon
by
these
unhallowed
efforts
of
indian
art
that
they
continued
for
a
long
time
to
talk
of
them
as
they
plied
their
paddles
they
were
thus
engaged
when
they
were
suddenly
aroused
by
a
real
danger
a
torrent
of
yellow
mud
rushed
furiously
athwart
the
calm
blue
current
of
the
mississippi
boiling
and
surging
and
sweeping
in
its
course
logs
branches
and
uprooted
trees
they
had
reached
the
mouth
of
the
missouri
where
that
savage
river
descending
from
its
mad
career
through
a
vast
unknown
of
barbarism
poured
its
turbid
floods
into
the
bosom
of
its
gentler
sister
their
light
canoes
whirled
on
the
miry
vortex
like
dry
leaves
on
an
angry
brook
i
never
writes
marquette
saw
anything
more
terrific
but
they
escaped
with
their
fright
and
held
their
way
down
the
turbulent
and
swollen
current
of
the
now
united
rivers
they
passed
the
lonely
forest
that
covered
the
site
of
the
destined
city
of
louis
and
a
few
days
later
saw
on
their
left
the
mouth
of
the
stream
to
which
the
iroquois
had
given
the
name
of
ohio
or
the
beautiful
river
soon
they
began
to
see
the
marshy
shores
buried
in
a
dense
growth
of
the
cane
with
its
tall
straight
stems
and
feathery
foliage
the
sun
glowed
through
the
hazy
air
with
a
languid
stifling
heat
and
by
day
and
night
mosquitoes
in
myriads
left
them
no
peace
they
floated
slowly
down
the
current
crouched
in
the
shade
of
the
sails
which
they
had
spread
as
awnings
when
suddenly
they
saw
indians
on
the
east
bank
the
surprise
was
mutual
and
each
party
was
as
much
frightened
as
the
other
marquette
hastened
to
display
the
calumet
which
the
illinois
had
given
him
by
way
of
passport
and
the
indians
recognizing
the
pacific
symbol
replied
with
an
invitation
to
land
evidently
they
were
in
communication
with
europeans
for
they
were
armed
with
guns
knives
and
hatchets
wore
garments
of
cloth
and
carried
their
gunpowder
in
small
bottles
of
thick
glass
they
feasted
the
frenchmen
with
bear
oil
and
white
plums
and
gave
them
a
variety
of
doubtful
information
including
the
agreeable
but
delusive
assurance
that
they
would
reach
the
mouth
of
the
river
in
ten
days
it
was
in
fact
more
than
a
thousand
miles
distant
sidenote
the
lower
mississippi
they
resumed
their
course
and
again
floated
down
the
interminable
monotony
of
river
marsh
and
forest
day
after
day
passed
on
in
solitude
and
they
had
paddled
some
three
hundred
miles
since
their
meeting
with
the
indians
when
as
they
neared
the
mouth
of
the
arkansas
they
saw
a
cluster
of
wigwams
on
the
west
bank
their
inmates
were
all
astir
yelling
the
snatching
their
weapons
and
running
to
the
shore
to
meet
the
strangers
who
on
their
part
called
for
succor
to
the
virgin
in
truth
they
had
need
of
her
aid
for
several
large
wooden
canoes
filled
with
savages
were
putting
out
from
the
shore
above
and
below
them
to
cut
off
their
retreat
while
a
swarm
of
headlong
young
warriors
waded
into
the
water
to
attack
them
the
current
proved
too
strong
and
failing
to
reach
the
canoes
of
the
frenchmen
one
of
them
threw
his
which
flew
over
the
heads
of
the
startled
travellers
meanwhile
marquette
had
not
ceased
to
hold
up
his
calumet
to
which
the
excited
crowd
gave
no
heed
but
strung
their
bows
and
notched
their
arrows
for
immediate
action
when
at
length
the
elders
of
the
village
arrived
saw
the
restrained
the
ardor
of
the
youth
and
urged
the
frenchmen
to
come
ashore
marquette
and
his
companions
complied
trembling
and
found
a
better
reception
than
they
had
reason
to
expect
one
of
the
indians
spoke
a
little
illinois
and
served
as
interpreter
a
friendly
conference
was
followed
by
a
feast
of
sagamite
and
fish
and
the
travellers
not
without
sore
misgivings
spent
the
night
in
the
lodges
of
their
entertainers
sidenote
the
arkansas
early
in
the
morning
they
embarked
again
and
proceeded
to
a
village
of
the
arkansas
tribe
about
eight
leagues
below
notice
of
their
coming
was
sent
before
them
by
their
late
hosts
and
as
they
drew
near
they
were
met
by
a
canoe
in
the
prow
of
which
stood
a
naked
personage
holding
a
calumet
singing
and
making
gestures
of
friendship
on
reaching
the
village
which
was
on
the
east
side
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
river
arkansas
they
were
conducted
to
a
sort
of
scaffold
before
the
lodge
of
the
the
space
beneath
had
been
prepared
for
their
reception
the
ground
being
neatly
covered
with
rush
mats
on
these
they
were
seated
the
warriors
sat
around
them
in
a
then
the
elders
of
the
tribe
and
then
the
promiscuous
crowd
of
villagers
standing
and
staring
over
the
heads
of
the
more
dignified
members
of
the
assembly
all
the
men
were
naked
but
to
compensate
for
the
lack
of
clothing
they
wore
strings
of
beads
in
their
noses
and
ears
the
women
were
clothed
in
shabby
skins
and
wore
their
hair
clumped
in
a
mass
behind
each
ear
by
good
luck
there
was
a
young
indian
in
the
village
who
had
an
excellent
knowledge
of
illinois
and
through
him
marquette
endeavored
to
explain
the
mysteries
of
christianity
and
to
gain
information
concerning
the
river
below
to
this
end
he
gave
his
auditors
the
presents
indispensable
on
such
occasions
but
received
very
little
in
return
they
told
him
that
the
mississippi
was
infested
by
hostile
indians
armed
with
guns
procured
from
white
men
and
that
they
the
arkansas
stood
in
such
fear
of
them
that
they
dared
not
hunt
the
buffalo
but
were
forced
to
live
on
indian
corn
of
which
they
raised
three
crops
a
year
during
the
speeches
on
either
side
food
was
brought
in
without
ceasing
sometimes
a
platter
of
sagamite
or
mush
sometimes
of
corn
boiled
whole
sometimes
a
roasted
dog
the
villagers
had
large
earthen
pots
and
platters
made
by
themselves
with
tolerable
skill
as
well
as
hatchets
knives
and
beads
gained
by
traffic
with
the
illinois
and
other
tribes
in
contact
with
the
french
or
spaniards
all
day
there
was
feasting
without
respite
after
the
merciless
practice
of
indian
hospitality
but
at
night
some
of
their
entertainers
proposed
to
kill
and
plunder
them
a
scheme
which
was
defeated
by
the
vigilance
of
the
chief
who
visited
their
quarters
and
danced
the
calumet
dance
to
reassure
his
guests
the
travellers
now
held
counsel
as
to
what
course
they
should
take
they
had
gone
far
enough
as
they
thought
to
establish
one
important
point
that
the
mississippi
discharged
its
waters
not
into
the
atlantic
or
sea
of
virginia
nor
into
the
gulf
of
california
or
vermilion
sea
but
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
they
thought
themselves
nearer
to
its
mouth
than
they
actually
were
the
distance
being
still
about
seven
hundred
miles
and
they
feared
that
if
they
went
farther
they
might
be
killed
by
indians
or
captured
by
spaniards
whereby
the
results
of
their
discovery
would
be
lost
therefore
they
resolved
to
return
to
canada
and
report
what
they
had
seen
they
left
the
arkansas
village
and
began
their
homeward
voyage
on
the
seventeenth
of
july
it
was
no
easy
task
to
urge
their
way
upward
in
the
heat
of
midsummer
against
the
current
of
the
dark
and
gloomy
stream
toiling
all
day
under
the
parching
sun
and
sleeping
at
night
in
the
exhalations
of
the
unwholesome
shore
or
in
the
narrow
confines
of
their
birchen
vessels
anchored
on
the
river
marquette
was
attacked
with
dysentery
languid
and
spent
he
invoked
his
celestial
mistress
as
day
after
day
and
week
after
week
they
won
their
slow
way
northward
at
length
they
reached
the
illinois
and
entering
its
mouth
followed
its
course
charmed
as
they
went
with
its
placid
waters
its
shady
forests
and
its
rich
plains
grazed
by
the
bison
and
the
deer
they
stopped
at
a
spot
soon
to
be
made
famous
in
the
annals
of
western
discovery
this
was
a
village
of
the
illinois
then
called
kaskaskia
a
name
afterwards
transferred
to
another
locality
a
chief
with
a
band
of
young
warriors
offered
to
guide
them
to
the
lake
of
the
illinois
that
is
to
say
lake
michigan
thither
they
repaired
and
coasting
its
shores
reached
green
bay
at
the
end
of
september
after
an
absence
of
about
four
months
during
which
they
had
paddled

canoes

the
report
of
his

count
frontenac
fortune
had
wonderfully
favored
him
on
his
long
and
perilous
journey
but
now
she
abandoned
him
on
the
very
threshold
of
home
at
the
foot
of
the
rapids
of
la
chine
and
immediately
above
montreal
his
canoe
was
overset
two
of
his
men
and
an
indian
boy
were
drowned
all
his

were
lost
and
he
himself
narrowly
escaped

speaks
of
the
accident
as
follows
i
had
escaped
every
peril
from
the
indians
i
had
passed
rapids
and
was
on
the
point
of
disembarking
full
of
joy
at
the
success
of
so
long
and
difficult
an
enterprise
when
my

capsized
after
all
the
danger
seemed
over
i
lost
two
men
and
my
box
of
papers
within
sight
of
the
first
french
settlements
which
i
had
left
almost
two
years
before
nothing
remains
to
me

ardent
desire
to
employ
it
on
any
service

you
may
please

spent
the
winter
and
the
following
summer
at
the
mission
of
green
bay
still
suffering
from
his
malady
in
the
autumn
however
it
abated
and
he
was
permitted
by
his
superior
to
attempt
the
execution
of
a
plan
to
which
he
was
devotedly
attached
the
founding
at
the

they
were
more
than
a

they
reached

entered
it
and
ascended
about
two

disease
had
lately
returned
and

ensued
he
told
his
two
companions
that
this
journey
would
be
his
last
in
the
condition
in
which
he
was
it
was
impossible
to
go

the
two
men
built
a
log
hut
by
the
river
and
here
they
prepared
to
spend
the

eighteen

adventurous
french

by
a
burning
desire
to
lay
before
he
died
the
foundation
of
his
new
mission
of
the
immaculate
conception
marquette
begged
his
two
followers
to
join
him
in
a
or
nine
days
devotion
to
the
virgin
in
consequence
of
this
as
he
believed
his
disease
relented
he
began
to
regain
strength
and
in
march
was
able
to
resume
the
journey
on
the
thirtieth
of
the
month
they
left
their
hut
which
had
been
inundated
by
a
sudden
rise
of
the
river
and
carried
their
canoe
through
mud
and
water
over
the
portage
which
led
to
the
des

marquette
knew
the
way
for
he
had
passed
by
this
route
on
his
return
from
the
mississippi
amid
the
rains
of
opening
spring
they
floated
down
the
swollen
current
of
the
des
plaines
by
naked
woods
and
spongy
saturated
prairies
till
they
reached
its
junction
with
the
main
stream
of
the
illinois
which
they
descended
to
their
destination
the
indian
town
which
marquette
calls
kaskaskia
here
as
we
are
told
he
was
received
like
an
angel
from
heaven
he
passed
from
wigwam
to
wigwam
telling
the
listening
crowds
of
god
and
the
virgin
paradise
and
hell
angels
and
demons
and
when
he
thought
their
minds
prepared
he
summoned
them
all
to

grand
council
it
took
place
near
the
town
on
the
great
meadow
which
lies
between
the
river

the
modern
village
of
utica
here
five
hundred
chiefs

men
were
seated
in

stood
fifteen
hundred
youths

temper
of
his
auditory
met
his
utmost
wishes
they
begged
him
to
stay
among
them
and
continue
his
instructions
but
his
life
was
fast
ebbing
away
and
it
behooved
him
to
depart
sidenote
burial
of
marquette
a
few
days
after
easter
he
left
the
village
escorted
by
a
crowd
of
indians
who
followed
him
as
far
as
lake
michigan
here
he
embarked
with
his
two
companions
their
destination
was
michilimackinac
and
their
course
lay
along
the
eastern
borders
of
the
lake
as
in
the
freshness
of
advancing
spring
pierre
and
jacques
urged
their
canoe
along
that
lonely
and
savage
shore
the
priest
lay
with
dimmed
sight
and
prostrated
strength
communing
with
the
virgin
and
the
angels
on
the
nineteenth
of
may
he
felt
that
his
hour
was
near
and
as
they
passed
the
mouth
of
a
small
river
he
requested
his
companions
to
land
they
complied
built
a
shed
of
bark
on
a
rising
ground
near
the
bank
and
carried
thither
the
dying
jesuit
with
perfect
cheerfulness
and
composure
he
gave
directions
for
his
burial
asked
their
forgiveness
for
the
trouble
he
had
caused
them
administered
to
them
the
sacrament
of
penitence
and
thanked
god
that
he
was
permitted
to
die
in
the
wilderness
a
missionary
of
the
faith
and
a
member
of
the
jesuit
brotherhood
at
night
seeing
that
they
were
fatigued
he
told
them
to
take
rest
saying
that
he
would
call
them
when
he
felt
his
time
approaching
two
or
three
hours
after
they
heard
a
feeble
voice
and
hastening
to
his
side
found
him
at
the
point
of
death
he
expired
calmly
murmuring
the
names
of
jesus
and
mary
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
crucifix
which
one
of
his
followers
held
before
him
they
dug
a
grave
beside
the
hut
and
here
they
buried
him
according
to
the
directions
which
he
had
given
them
then
they
made
their
way
to
michilimackinac
to
bear
the
tidings
to
the
priests
at
the
mission
of
st
ignace
in
the
winter
of
a
party
of
kiskakon
ottawas
were
hunting
on
lake
michigan
and
when
in
the
following
spring
they
prepared
to
return
home
they
bethought
them
in
accordance
with
an
indian
custom
of
taking
with
them
the
bones
of
marquette
who
had
been
their
instructor
at
the
mission
of
esprit
they
repaired
to
the
spot
found
the
grave
opened
it
washed
and
dried
the
bones
and
placed
them
carefully
in
a
box
of
then
in
a
procession
of
thirty
canoes
they
bore
it
singing
their
funeral
songs
to
ignace
of
michilimackinac
as
they
approached
priests
indians
and
traders
all
thronged
to
the
shore
the
relics
of
marquette
were
received
with
solemn
ceremony
and
buried
beneath
the
floor
of
the

of

joliet
married
claire
bissot
daughter
of
a
wealthy
canadian
merchant
engaged
in
trade
with
the
northern
indians
this
drew
joliet
attention
to
hudson
bay
and
he
made
a
journey
thither
in
by
way
of
the
saguenay
he
found
three
english
forts
on
the
bay
occupied
by
about
sixty
men
who
had
also
an
armed
vessel
of
twelve
guns
and
several
small
the
english
held
out
great
inducements
to
joliet
to
join
them
but
he
declined
and
returned
to
quebec
where
he
reported
that
unless
these
formidable
rivals
were
dispossessed
the
trade
of
canada
would
be
ruined
in
consequence
of
this
report
some
of
the
principal
merchants
of
the
colony
formed
a
company
to
compete
with
the
english
in
the
trade
of
hudson
bay
in
the
year
of
this
journey
joliet
received
a
grant
of
the
islands
of
mignan
and
in
the
following
year
he
received
another
grant
of
the
great
island
of
anticosti
in
the
lower
lawrence
in
he
was
established
here
with
his
wife
and
six
servants
he
was
engaged
in
fisheries
and
being
a
skilful
navigator
and
surveyor
he
made
about
this
time
a
chart
of
the
lawrence
in
sir
william

his
way
with
an
english
fleet
to
attack

auspices

company
formed
for

on
his
return
frontenac
made
him
royal

for

at
about
the

time
he
received
the
appointment
of
hydrographer
at
quebec
he
died
apparently
poor
in
or
and
was
buried
on
one
of
the
islands

the
discovery
of
the

facts
is
due
in

part
to
the
researches
of

was
afterwards
bitterly
complained
of
by
the
intendant
duchesneau
for
acting
as
the
agent
in
illicit
trade
with
the
indians
the
contemporary
tells
us
that
a
miracle
took
place
at
the
burial
of
marquette
one
of
the
two
frenchmen
overcome
with
grief
and
colic
bethought
him
of
applying
a
little
earth
from
the
grave
to
the
seat
of
pain
this
at
once
restored
him
to
health
and
cheerfulness

charlevoix
account
of
marquette
death
is
derived
from
tradition
and
is
not
supported
by
the
contemporary
narrative
in
human
bones
with
fragments

found
buried
on
the
supposed
site
of

jesuit
chapel
at
point
ignace
in
the
missionary
of
the
algonquins
at
the
lake
of
two
mountains
above
montreal
wrote
down
a
tradition
of
the
death
of
marquette
from
the
lips
of
an
old
indian
woman
born
in
at
michilimackinac
her
ancestress
had
been
baptized
by
the
subject
of
the
story
the
tradition
has
a
resemblance
to
that
related
as
fact
by
charlevoix
the
old
squaw
said
that
the
jesuit
was
returning
very
ill
to
michilimackinac
when
a
storm
forced
him
and
his
two
men
to
land
near
a
little
river
here
he
told
them
that
he
should
die
and
directed
them
to
ring
a
bell
over
his
grave
and
plant
a
cross
they
all
remained
four
days
at
the
spot
and
though
without
food
the
men
felt
no
hunger
on
the
night
of
the
fourth
day
he
died
and
the
men
buried
him
as
he
had
directed
on
waking
in
the
morning
they
saw
a
sack
of
indian
corn
a
quantity
of
bacon
and
some
biscuit
miraculously
sent
to
them
in
accordance
with
the
promise
of
marquette
who
had
told
them
that
they
should
have
food
enough
for
their
journey
to
michilimackinac
at
the
same
instant
the
stream
began
to
rise
and
in
a
few
moments
encircled
the
grave
of
the
jesuit
which
formed
thenceforth
an
islet
in
the
waters
the
tradition
adds
that
an
indian
battle
afterwards
took
place
on
the
banks
of
this
stream
between
christians
and
infidels
and
that
the
former
gained
the
victory
in
consequence
of
invoking
the
name
of
marquette
this
story
bears
the
attestation
of
the
priest
of
the
two
mountains
that
it
is
a
literal
translation
of
the
tradition
as
recounted
by
the
old
woman
it
has
been
asserted
that
the
illinois
country
was
visited
by
two
priests
some
time
before
the
visit
of
marquette
this
assertion
was
first
made
by
noiseux
late
grand
vicar
of
quebec
who
gives
no
authority
for
it
not
the
slightest
indication
of
any
such
visit
appears
in
any
contemporary
document
or
map
thus
far
discovered
the
contemporary
writers
down
to
the
time
of
marquette
and
la
salle
all
speak
of
the
illinois
as
an
unknown
country
the
entire
groundlessness
of
noiseux
assertion
is
shown
by
shea
in
a

his
enemies
we
turn
from
the
humble
marquette
thanking
god
with
his
last
breath
that
he
died
for
his
order
and
his
faith
and
by
our
side
stands
the
masculine
form
of
cavelier
de
la
salle
prodigious
was
the
contrast
between
the
two
discoverers
the
one
with
clasped
hands
and
upturned
eyes
seems
a
figure
evoked
from
some
dim
legend
of
mediæval
saintship
the
other
with
feet
firm
planted
on
the
hard
earth
breathes
the
energies
of
modern
practical
enterprise
nevertheless
la
salle
enemies
called
him
a
visionary
his
projects
perplexed
and
startled
them
at
first
they
ridiculed
him
and
then
as
step
by
step
he
advanced
towards
his
purpose
they
denounced
and
maligned
him
what
was
this
purpose
it
was
not
of
sudden
growth
but
developed
as
years
went
on
la
salle
at
la
chine
dreamed
of
a
western
passage
to
china
and
nursed
vague
schemes
of
western
discovery
then
when
his
earlier
journeyings
revealed
to
him
the
valley
of
the
ohio
and
the
fertile
plains
of
illinois
his
imagination
took
wing
over
the
boundless
prairies
and
forests
drained
by
the
great
river
of
the
west
his
ambition
had
found
its
field
he
would
leave
barren
and
frozen
canada
behind
and
lead
france
and
civilization
into
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
neither
the
english
nor
the
jesuits
should
conquer
that
rich
domain
the
one
must
rest
content
with
the
country
east
of
the
alleghanies
and
the
other
with
the
forests
savages
and
of
the
northern
lakes
it
was
for
him
to
call
into
light
the
latent
riches
of
the
great
west
but
the
way
to
his
land
of
promise
was
rough
and
long
it
lay
through
canada
filled
with
hostile
traders
and
hostile
priests
and
barred
by
ice
for
half
the
year
the
difficulty
was
soon
solved
la
salle
became
convinced
that
the
mississippi
flowed
not
into
the
pacific
or
the
gulf
of
california
but
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
by
a
fortified
post
at
its
mouth
he
could
guard
it
against
both
english
and
spaniards
and
secure
for
the
trade
of
the
interior
an
access
and
an
outlet
under
his
own
control
and
open
at
every
season
of
this
trade
the
hides
of
the
buffalo
would
at
first
form
the
staple
and
along
with
furs
would
reward
the
enterprise
till
other
resources
should
be
developed
such
were
the
vast
projects
that
unfolded
themselves
in
the
mind
of
la
salle
canada
must
needs
be
at
the
outset
his
base
of
action
and
without
the
support
of
its
authorities
he
could
do
nothing
this
support
he
found
from
the
moment
when
count
frontenac
assumed
the
government
of
the
colony
he
seems
to
have
looked
with
favor
on
the
young
discoverer
there
were
points
of
likeness
between
the
two
men
both
were
ardent
bold
and
enterprising
the
irascible
and
fiery
pride
of
the
noble
found
its
match
in
the
reserved
and
seemingly
cold
pride
of
the
ambitious
burgher
each
could
comprehend
the
other
and
they
had
moreover
strong
prejudices
and
dislikes
in
common
an
understanding
not
to
say
an
alliance
soon
grew
up
between
them
sidenote
projects
of
frontenac
frontenac
had
come
to
canada
a
ruined
man
he
was
ostentatious
lavish
and
in
no
way
disposed
to
let
slip
an
opportunity
of
mending
his
fortune
he
presently
thought
that
he
had
found
a
plan
by
which
he
could
serve
both
the
colony
and
himself
his
predecessor
courcelle
had
urged
upon
the
king
the
expediency
of
building
a
fort
on
lake
ontario
in
order
to
hold
the
iroquois
in
check
and
intercept
the
trade
which
the
tribes
of
the
upper
lakes
had
begun
to
carry
on
with
the
dutch
and
english
of
new
york
thus
a
stream
of
wealth
would
be
turned
into
canada
which
would
otherwise
enrich
her
enemies
here
to
all
appearance
was
a
great
public
good
and
from
the
military
point
of
view
it
was
so
in
fact
but
it
was
clear
that
the
trade
thus
secured
might
be
made
to
profit
not
the
colony
at
large
but
those
alone
who
had
control
of
the
fort
which
would
then
become
the
instrument
of
a
monopoly
this
the
governor
understood
and
without
doubt
he
meant
that
the
projected
establishment
should
pay
him
tribute
how
far
he
and
la
salle
were
acting
in
concurrence
at
this
time
it
is
not
easy
to
say
but
frontenac
often
took
counsel
of
the
explorer
who
on
his
part
saw
in
the
design
a
possible
first
step
towards
the
accomplishment
of
his
own
schemes
sidenote
expedition
of
frontenac
such
of
the
canadian
merchants
as
were
not
in
the
governor
confidence
looked
on
his
plan
with
extreme
distrust
frontenac
therefore
thought
it
expedient
to
make
use
as
he
expresses
it
of
address
he
gave
out
merely
that
he
intended
to
make
a
tour
through
the
upper
parts
of
the
colony
with
an
armed
force
in
order
to
inspire
the
indians
with
respect
and
secure
a
solid
peace
he
had
neither
troops
money
munitions
nor
means
of
transportation
yet
there
was
no
time
to
lose
for
should
he
delay
the
execution
of
his
plan
it
might
be
countermanded
by
the
king
his
only
resource
therefore
was
in
a
prompt
and
hardy
exertion
of
the
royal
authority
and
he
issued
an
order
requiring
the
inhabitants
of
quebec
montreal
three
rivers
and
other
settlements
to
furnish
him
at
their
own
cost
as
soon
as
the
spring
sowing
should
be
over
with
a
certain
number
of
armed
men
besides
the
requisite
canoes
at
the
same
time
he
invited
the
officers
settled
in
the
country
to
join
the
expedition
an
invitation
which
anxious
as
they
were
to
gain
his
good
graces
few
of
them
cared
to
decline
regardless
of
murmurs
and
discontent
he
pushed
his
preparation
vigorously
and
on
the
third
of
june
left
quebec
with
his
guard
his
staff
a
part
of
the
garrison
of
the
castle
of
louis
and
a
number
of
volunteers
he
had
already
sent
to
la
salle
who
was
then
at
montreal
directing
him
to
repair
to
onondaga
the
political
centre
of
the
iroquois
and
invite
their
sachems
to
meet
the
governor
in
council
at
the
bay
of
quinté
on
the
north
of
lake
ontario
la
salle
had
set
out
on
his
mission
but
first
sent
frontenac
a
map
which
convinced
him
that
the
best
site
for
his
proposed
fort
was
the
mouth
of
the
cataraqui
where
kingston
now
stands
another
messenger
was
accordingly
despatched
to
change
the
rendezvous
to
this
point
meanwhile
the
governor
proceeded
at
his
leisure
towards
montreal
stopping
by
the
way
to
visit
the
officers
settled
along
the
bank
who
eager
to
pay
their
homage
to
the
newly
risen
sun
received
him
with
a
hospitality
which
under
the
roof
of
a
log
hut
was
sometimes
graced
by
the
polished
courtesies
of
the
salon
and
the
boudoir
reaching
montreal
which
he
had
never
before
seen
he
gazed
we
may
suppose
with
some
interest
at
the
long
row
of
humble
dwellings
which
lined
the
bank
the
massive
buildings
of
the
seminary
and
the
spire
of
the
church
predominant
over
all
it
was
a
rude
scene
but
the
greeting
that
awaited
him
savored
nothing
of
the
rough
simplicity
of
the
wilderness
perrot
the
local
governor
was
on
the
shore
with
his
soldiers
and
the
inhabitants
drawn
up
under
arms
and
firing
a
salute
to
welcome
the
representative
of
the
king
frontenac
was
compelled
to
listen
to
a
long
harangue
from
the
judge
of
the
place
followed
by
another
from
the
syndic
then
there
was
a
solemn
procession
to
the
church
where
he
was
forced
to
undergo
a
third
effort
of
oratory
from
one
of
the
priests
followed
in
thanks
for
his
arrival
and
then
he
took
refuge
in
the
fort
here
he
remained
thirteen
days
busied
with
his
preparations
organizing
the
militia
soothing
their
mutual
jealousies
and
settling
knotty
questions
of
rank
and
precedence
during
this
time
every
means
as
he
declares
was
used
to
prevent
him
from
proceeding
and
among
other
devices
a
rumor
was
set
on
foot
that
a
dutch
fleet
having
just
captured
boston
was
on
its
way
to
attack
quebec
sidenote

journey
having
sent
men
canoes
and
baggage
by
land
to
la
salle
old
settlement
of
la
chine
frontenac
himself
followed
on
the
of
june
including
indians
from
the
missions
he
now
had
with
him
about
four
hundred
men
and
a
hundred
and
twenty
canoes
besides
two
large
which
he
caused
to
be
painted
in
red
and
blue
with
strange
devices
intended
to
dazzle
the
iroquois
by
a
display
of
unwonted
splendor
now
their
hard
task
began
shouldering
canoes
through
the
forest
dragging
the
along
the
shore
working
like
beavers
sometimes
in
water
to
the
knees
sometimes
to
the
armpits
their
feet
cut
by
the
sharp
stones
and
they
themselves
swept
down
by
the
furious
current
they
fought
their
way
upward
against
the
chain
of
mighty
rapids
that
break
the
navigation
of
the
lawrence
the
indians
were
of
the
greatest
service
frontenac
like
la
salle
showed
from
the
first
a
special
faculty
of
managing
them
for
his
keen
incisive
spirit
was
exactly
to
their
liking
and
they
worked
for
him
as
they
would
have
worked
for
no
man
else
as
they
approached
the
long
saut
rain
fell
in
torrents
and
the
governor
without
his
cloak
and
drenched
to
the
skin
directed
in
person
the
amphibious
toil
of
his
followers
once
it
is
said
he
lay
awake
all
night
in
his
anxiety
lest
the
biscuit
should
be
wet
which
would
have
ruined
the
expedition
no
such
mischance
took
place
and
at
length
the
last
rapid
was
passed
and
smooth
water
awaited
them
to
their
journey
end
soon
they
reached
the
thousand
islands
and
their
light
flotilla
glided
in
long
file
among
those
watery
labyrinths
by
rocky
islets
where
some
lonely
pine
towered
like
a
mast
against
the
sky
by
crags
where
the
brown
lichens
crisped
in
the
parching
glare
by
deep
dells
shady
and
cool
rich
in
rank
ferns
and
spongy
mosses
by
still
coves
where
the
lay
like
on
their
broad
flat
leaves
till
at
length
they
neared
their
goal
and
the
glistening
bosom
of
lake
ontario
opened
on
their
sight
frontenac
to
impose
respect
on
the
iroquois
now
set
his
canoes
in
order
of
battle
four
divisions
formed
the
first
line
then
came
the
two
he
himself
with
his
guards
his
staff
and
the
gentlemen
volunteers
followed
with
the
canoes
of
three
rivers
on
his
right
and
those
of
the
indians
on
his
left
while
two
remaining
divisions
formed
a
rear
line
thus
with
measured
paddles
they
advanced
over
the
still
lake
till
they
saw
a
canoe
approaching
to
meet
them
it
bore
several
iroquois
chiefs
who
told
them
that
the
dignitaries
of
their
nation
awaited
them
at
cataraqui
and
offered
to
guide
them
to
the
spot
they
entered
the
wide
mouth
of
the
river
and
passed
along
the
shore
now
covered
by
the
quiet
little
city
of
kingston
till
they
reached
the
point
at
present
occupied
by
the
barracks
at
the
western
end
of
cataraqui
bridge
here
they
stranded
their
canoes
and
disembarked
baggage
was
landed
fires
lighted
tents
pitched
and
guards
set
close
at
hand
under
the
lee
of
the
forest
were
the
camping
sheds
of
the
iroquois
who
had
come
to
the
rendezvous
in
considerable
numbers
sidenote
frontenac
at
cataraqui
at
daybreak
of
the
next
morning
the
thirteenth
of
july
the
drums
beat
and
the
whole
party
were
drawn
up
under
arms
a
double
line
of
men
extended
from
the
front
of
frontenac
tent
to
the
indian
camp
and
through
the
lane
thus
formed
the
savage
deputies
sixty
in
number
advanced
to
the
place
of
council
they
could
not
hide
their
admiration
at
the
martial
array
of
the
french
many
of
whom
were
old
soldiers
of
the
regiment
of
carignan
and
when
they
reached
the
tent
they
ejaculated
their
astonishment
at
the
uniforms
of
the
governor
guard
who
surrounded
it
here
the
ground
had
been
carpeted
with
the
sails
of
the
on
which
the
deputies
squatted
themselves
in
a
ring
and
smoked
their
pipes
for
a
time
with
their
usual
air
of
deliberate
gravity
while
frontenac
who
sat
surrounded
by
his
officers
had
full
leisure
to
contemplate
the
formidable
adversaries
whose
mettle
was
hereafter
to
put
his
own
to
so
severe
a
test
a
chief
named
garakontié
a
noted
friend
of
the
french
at
length
opened
the
council
in
behalf
of
all
the
five
iroquois
nations
with
expressions
of
great
respect
and
deference
towards
onontio
that
is
to
say
the
governor
of
canada
whereupon
frontenac
whose
native
arrogance
where
indians
were
concerned
always
took
a
form
which
imposed
respect
without
exciting
anger
replied
in
the
following
strain
children
mohawks
oneidas
onondagas
cayugas
and
senecas
i
am
glad
to
see
you
here
where
i
have
had
a
fire
lighted
for
you
to
smoke
by
and
for
me
to
talk
to
you
you
have
done
well
my
children
to
obey
the
command
of
your
father
take
courage
you
will
hear
his
word
which
is
full
of
peace
and
tenderness
for
do
not
think
that
i
have
come
for
war
my
mind
is
full
of
peace
and
she
walks
by
my
side
courage
then
children
and
take
rest
with
that
he
gave
them
six
fathoms
of
tobacco
reiterated
his
assurances
of
friendship
promised
that
he
would
be
a
kind
father
so
long
as
they
should
be
obedient
children
regretted
that
he
was
forced
to
speak
through
an
interpreter
and
ended
with
a
gift
of
guns
to
the
men
and
prunes
and
raisins
to
their
wives
and
children
here
closed
this
preliminary
meeting
the
great
council
being
postponed
to
another
day
during
the
meeting
raudin
frontenac
engineer
was
tracing
out
the
lines
of
a
fort
after
a
predetermined
plan
and
the
whole
party
under
the
direction
of
their
officers
now
set
themselves
to
construct
it
some
cut
down
trees
some
dug
the
trenches
some
hewed
the
palisades
and
with
such
order
and
alacrity
was
the
work
urged
on
that
the
indians
were
lost
in
astonishment
meanwhile
frontenac
spared
no
pains
to
make
friends
of
the
chiefs
some
of
whom
he
had
constantly
at
his
table
he
fondled
the
iroquois
children
and
gave
them
bread
and
sweetmeats
and
in
the
evening
feasted
the
squaws
to
make
them
dance
the
indians
were
delighted
with
these
attentions
and
conceived
a
high
opinion
of
the
new
onontio
sidenote
frontenac
and
the
indians
on
the
seventeenth
when
the
construction
of
the
fort
was
well
advanced
frontenac
called
the
chiefs
to
a
grand
council
which
was
held
with
all
possible
state
and
ceremony
his
dealing
with
the
indians
on
this
and
other
occasions
was
truly
admirable
unacquainted
as
he
was
with
them
he
seems
to
have
had
an
instinctive
perception
of
the
treatment
they
required
his
predecessors
had
never
ventured
to
address
the
iroquois
as
children
but
had
always
styled
them
brothers
and
yet
the
assumption
of
paternal
authority
on
the
part
of
frontenac
was
not
only
taken
in
good
part
but
was
received
with
apparent
gratitude
the
martial
nature
of
the
man
his
clear
decisive
speech
and
his
frank
and
downright
manner
backed
as
they
were
by
a
display
of
force
which
in
their
eyes
was
formidable
struck
them
with
admiration
and
gave
tenfold
effect
to
his
words
of
kindness
they
thanked
him
for
that
which
from
another
they
would
not
have
endured
frontenac
began
by
again
expressing
his
satisfaction
that
they
had
obeyed
the
commands
of
their
father
and
come
to
cataraqui
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
then
he
exhorted
them
to
embrace
christianity
and
on
this
theme
he
dwelt
at
length
in
words
excellently
adapted
to
produce
the
desired
effect
words
which
it
would
be
most
superfluous
to
tax
as
insincere
though
doubtless
they
lost
nothing
in
emphasis
because
in
this
instance
conscience
and
policy
aimed
alike
then
changing
his
tone
he
pointed
to
his
officers
his
guard
the
long
files
of
the
militia
and
the
two
mounted
with
cannon
which
lay
in
the
river
near
by
if
he
said
your
father
can
come
so
far
with
so
great
a
force
through
such
dangerous
rapids
merely
to
make
you
a
visit
of
pleasure
and
friendship
what
would
he
do
if
you
should
awaken
his
anger
and
make
it
necessary
for
him
to
punish
his
disobedient
children
he
is
the
arbiter
of
peace
and
war
beware
how
you
offend
him
and
he
warned
them
not
to
molest
the
indian
allies
of
the
french
telling
them
sharply
that
he
would
chastise
them
for
the
least
infraction
of
the
peace
from
threats
he
passed
to
blandishments
and
urged
them
to
confide
in
his
paternal
kindness
saying
that
in
proof
of
his
affection
he
was
building
a
at
cataraqui
where
they
could
be
supplied
with
all
the
goods
they
needed
without
the
necessity
of
a
long
and
dangerous
journey
he
warned
them
against
listening
to
bad
men
who
might
seek
to
delude
them
by
misrepresentations
and
falsehoods
and
he
urged
them
to
give
heed
to
none
but
men
of
character
like
the
sieur
de
la
salle
he
expressed
a
hope
that
they
would
suffer
their
children
to
learn
french
from
the
missionaries
in
order
that
they
and
his
nephews
meaning
the
french
colonists
might
become
one
people
and
he
concluded
by
requesting
them
to
give
him
a
number
of
their
children
to
be
educated
in
the
french
manner
at
quebec
sidenote
treaty
with
the
indians
this
speech
every
clause
of
which
was
reinforced
by
abundant
presents
was
extremely
well
received
though
one
speaker
reminded
him
that
he
had
forgotten
one
important
point
inasmuch
as
he
had
not
told
them
at
what
prices
they
could
obtain
goods
at
cataraqui
frontenac
evaded
a
precise
answer
but
promised
them
that
the
goods
should
be
as
cheap
as
possible
in
view
of
the
great
difficulty
of
transportation
as
to
the
request
concerning
their
children
they
said
that
they
could
not
accede
to
it
till
they
had
talked
the
matter
over
in
their
villages
but
it
is
a
striking
proof
of
the
influence
which
frontenac
had
gained
over
them
that
in
the
following
year
they
actually
sent
several
of
their
children
to
quebec
to
be
educated
the
girls
among
the
ursulines
and
the
boys
in
the
household
of
the
governor
three
days
after
the
council
the
iroquois
set
out
on
their
return
and
as
the
palisades
of
the
fort
were
now
finished
and
the
barracks
nearly
so
frontenac
began
to
send
his
party
homeward
by
detachments
he
himself
was
detained
for
a
time
by
the
arrival
of
another
band
of
iroquois
from
the
villages
on
the
north
side
of
lake
ontario
he
repeated
to
them
the
speech
he
had
made
to
the
others
and
this
final
meeting
over
he
embarked
with
his
guard
leaving
a
sufficient
number
to
hold
the
fort
which
was
to
be
provisioned
for
a
year
by
means
of
a
convoy
then
on
its
way
up
the
river
passing
the
rapids
safely
he
reached
montreal
on
the
first
of
august
his
enterprise
had
been
a
complete
success
he
had
gained
every
point
and
in
spite
of
the
dangerous
navigation
had
not
lost
a
single
canoe
thanks
to
the
enforced
and
gratuitous
assistance
of
the
inhabitants
the
whole
had
cost
the
king
only
about
ten
thousand
francs
which
frontenac
had
advanced
on
his
own
credit
though
in
a
commercial
point
of
view
the
new
establishment
was
of
very
questionable
benefit
to
the
colony
at
large
the
governor
had
nevertheless
conferred
an
inestimable
blessing
on
all
canada
by
the
assurance
he
had
gained
of
a
long
respite
from
the
fearful
scourge
of
iroquois
hostility
assuredly
he
writes
i
may
boast
of
having
impressed
them
at
once
with
respect
fear
and
he
adds
that
the
fort
at
cataraqui
with
the
aid
of
a
vessel
now
building
will
command
lake
ontario
keep
the
peace
with
the
iroquois
and
cut
off
the
trade
with
the
english
and
he
proceeds
to
say
that
by
another
fort
at
the
mouth
of
the
niagara
and
another
vessel
on
lake
erie
we
the
french
can
command
all
the
upper
lakes
this
plan
was
an
essential
link
in
the
schemes
of
la
salle
and
we
shall
soon
find
him
employed
in
executing
it
a
curious
incident
occurred
soon
after
the
building
of
the
fort
on
lake
ontario
frontenac
on
his
way
back
quarrelled
with
perrot
the
governor
of
montreal
whom
in
view
of
his
speculations
in
the
he
seems
to
have
regarded
as
a
rival
in
business
but
who
by
his
folly
and
arrogance
would
have
justified
any
reasonable
measure
of
severity
frontenac
however
was
not
reasonable
he
arrested
perrot
threw
him
into
prison
and
set
up
a
man
of
his
own
as
governor
in
his
place
and
as
the
judge
of
montreal
was
not
in
his
interest
he
removed
him
and
substituted
another
on
whom
he
could
rely
thus
for
a
time
he
had
montreal
well
in
hand
the
priests
of
the
seminary
seigniors
of
the
island
regarded
these
arbitrary
proceedings
with
extreme
uneasiness
they
claimed
the
right
of
nominating
their
own
governor
and
perrot
though
he
held
a
commission
from
the
king
owed
his
place
to
their
appointment
true
he
had
set
them
at
nought
and
proved
a
veritable
king
stork
yet
nevertheless
they
regarded
his
removal
as
an
infringement
of
their
rights
during
the
quarrel
with
perrot
la
salle
chanced
to
be
at
montreal
lodged
in
the
house
of
jacques
le
ber
who
though
one
of
the
principal
merchants
and
most
influential
inhabitants
of
the
settlement
was
accustomed
to
sell
goods
across
his
counter
in
person
to
white
men
and
indians
his
wife
taking
his
place
when
he
was
absent
such
were
the
primitive
manners
of
the
secluded
little
colony
le
ber
at
this
time
was
in
the
interest
of
frontenac
and
la
salle
though
he
afterwards
became
one
of
their
most
determined
opponents
amid
the
excitement
and
discussion
occasioned
by
perrot
arrest
la
salle
declared
himself
an
adherent
of
the
governor
and
warned
all
persons
against
speaking
ill
of
him
in
his
hearing
sidenote
abbé
fénelon
the
abbé
fénelon
already
mentioned
as
to
the
famous
archbishop
had
attempted
to
mediate
between
frontenac
and
perrot
and
to
this
end
had
made
a
journey
to
quebec
on
the
ice
in
midwinter
being
of
an
ardent
temperament
and
more
courageous
than
prudent
he
had
spoken
somewhat
indiscreetly
and
had
been
very
roughly
treated
by
the
stormy
and
imperious
count
he
returned
to
montreal
greatly
excited
and
not
without
cause
it
fell
to
his
lot
to
preach
the
easter
sermon
the
service
was
held
in
the
little
church
of
the
which
was
crowded
to
the
porch
all
the
chief
persons
of
the
settlement
being
present
the
curé
of
the
parish
whose
name
also
was
perrot
said
high
mass
assisted
by
la
salle
brother
cavelier
and
two
other
priests
then
fénelon
mounted
the
pulpit
certain
passages
of
his
sermon
were
obviously
levelled
against
frontenac
speaking
of
the
duties
of
those
clothed
with
temporal
authority
he
said
that
the
magistrate
inspired
with
the
spirit
of
christ
was
as
ready
to
pardon
offences
against
himself
as
to
punish
those
against
his
prince
that
he
was
full
of
respect
for
the
ministers
of
the
altar
and
never
maltreated
them
when
they
attempted
to
reconcile
enemies
and
restore
peace
that
he
never
made
favorites
of
those
who
flattered
him
nor
under
specious
pretexts
oppressed
other
persons
in
authority
who
opposed
his
enterprises
that
he
used
his
power
to
serve
his
king
and
not
to
his
own
advantage
that
he
remained
content
with
his
salary
without
disturbing
the
commerce
of
the
country
or
abusing
those
who
refused
him
a
share
in
their
profits
and
that
he
never
troubled
the
people
by
inordinate
and
unjust
levies
of
men
and
material
using
the
name
of
his
prince
as
a
cover
to
his
own
designs
sidenote
la
salle
and
fénelon
la
salle
sat
near
the
door
but
as
the
preacher
proceeded
he
suddenly
rose
to
his
feet
in
such
a
manner
as
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
congregation
as
they
turned
their
heads
he
signed
to
the
principal
persons
among
them
and
by
his
angry
looks
and
gesticulation
called
their
attention
to
the
words
of
fénelon
then
meeting
the
eye
of
the
curé
who
sat
beside
the
altar
he
made
the
same
signs
to
him
to
which
the
curé
replied
by
a
deprecating
shrug
of
the
shoulders
fénelon
changed
color
but
continued
his
sermon
this
indecent
proceeding
of
la
salle
and
the
zeal
with
which
throughout
the
quarrel
he
took
the
part
of
the
governor
did
not
go
unrewarded
henceforth
frontenac
was
more
than
ever
his
friend
and
this
plainly
appeared
in
the
disposition
made
through
his
influence
of
the
new
fort
on
lake
ontario
attempts
had
been
made
to
induce
the
king
to
have
it
demolished
but
it
was
resolved
at
last
that
being
built
it
should
be
allowed
to
stand
and
after
long
delay
a
final
arrangement
was
made
for
its
maintenance
in
the
manner
following
in
the
autumn
of
la
salle
went
to
france
with
letters
of
strong
recommendation
from
frontenac
he
was
well
received
at
court
and
he
made
two
petitions
to
the
king
the
one
for
a
patent
of
nobility
in
consideration
of
his
services
as
an
explorer
and
the
other
for
a
grant
in
seigniory
of
fort
frontenac
for
so
he
called
the
new
post
in
honor
of
his
patron
on
his
part
he
offered
to
pay
back
the
ten
thousand
francs
which
the
fort
had
cost
the
king
to
maintain
it
at
his
own
charge
with
a
garrison
equal
to
that
of
montreal
besides
fifteen
or
twenty
laborers
to
form
a
french
colony
around
it
to
build
a
church
whenever
the
number
of
inhabitants
should
reach
one
hundred
and
meanwhile
to
support
one
or
more
récollet
friars
and
finally
to
form
a
settlement
of
domesticated
indians
in
the
neighborhood
his
offers
were
accepted
he
was
raised
to
the
rank
of
the
untitled

a
grant
of
the
fort

lands
adjacent
to

friends
and
his
family
rejoicing
in
his
good
fortune
and
not
unwilling
to

him
large
advances

to

the
better
part
of

but
he
was
not

and
no
commercial

could
content
his
ambition
those
may
believe
who
will
that

did
not
expect
a

in
the
profits
of
the

that
he

deposition

taken
at
the
instance
of
his
enemy

in
which
three
witnesses
attest
that
the

once
his

not
satisfied
with

monopoly
of

la

aimed
at
the
control
of

the
usufruct

continent
the
ire
of

opponents
redoubled
and
canada
became
for
him
a
nest
of
hornets
buzzing
in
wrath
and
watching
the
moment
to
sting
but
there
was
another
element
of
opposition
less
noisy
but
not
less
formidable
and
this
arose
from
the
jesuits
frontenac
hated
them
and
they
under
befitting
forms
of
duty
and
courtesy
paid
him
back
in
the
same
coin
having
no
love
for
the
governor
they
would
naturally
have
little
for
his
partisan
and
but
their
opposition
had
another
and
a
deeper
root
for
the
plans
of
the
daring
young
schemer
jarred
with
their
own
sidenote
purposes
of
the
jesuits
we
have
seen
the
canadian
jesuits
in
the
early
apostolic
days
of
their
mission
when
the
flame
of
their
zeal
fed
by
an
ardent
hope
burned
bright
and
high
this
hope
was
doomed
to
disappointment
their
avowed
purpose
of
building
another
paraguay
on
the
borders
of
the
great
lakes
was
never
accomplished
and
their
missions
and
their
converts
were
swept
away
in
an
avalanche
of
ruin
still
they
would
not
despair
from
the
lakes
they
turned
their
eyes
to
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
in
the
hope
to
see
it
one
day
the
seat
of
their
new
empire
of
the
faith
but
what
did
this
new
paraguay
mean
it
meant
a
little
nation
of
converted
and
domesticated
savages
docile
as
children
under
the
paternal
and
absolute
rule
of
jesuit
fathers
and
trained
by
them
in
industrial
pursuits
the
results
of
which
were
to
inure
not
to
the
profit
of
the
producers
but
to
the
building
of
churches
the
founding
of
colleges
the
establishment
of
warehouses
and
magazines
and
the
construction
of
works
of
defence
all
controlled
by
jesuits
and
forming
a
part
of
the
vast
possessions
of
the
order
such
was
the
old
paraguay
and
such
we
may
suppose
would
have
been
the
new
had
the
plans
of
those
who
designed
it
been
realized
i
have
said
that
since
the
middle
of
the
century
the
religious
exaltation
of
the
early
missions
had
sensibly
declined
in
the
nature
of
things
that
grand
enthusiasm
was
too
intense
and
fervent
to
be
long
sustained
but
the
vital
force
of
jesuitism
had
suffered
no
diminution
that
marvellous
de
that
extinction
of
self
and
absorption
of
the
individual
in
the
order
which
has
marked
the
jesuits
from
their
first
existence
as
a
body
was
no
whit
changed
or
lessened
a
principle
which
though
different
was
no
less
strong
than
the
patriotism
of
sparta
or
the
early
roman
republic
the
jesuits
were
no
longer
supreme
in
canada
or
in
other
words
canada
was
no
longer
simply
a
mission
it
had
become
a
colony
temporal
interests
and
the
civil
power
were
constantly
gaining
ground
and
the
disciples
of
loyola
felt
that
relatively
if
not
absolutely
they
were
losing
it
they
struggled
vigorously
to
maintain
the
ascendency
of
their
order
or
as
they
would
have
expressed
it
the
ascendency
of
religion
but
in
the
older
and
more
settled
parts
of
the
colony
it
was
clear
that
the
day
of
their
undivided
rule
was
past
therefore
they
looked
with
redoubled
solicitude
to
their
missions
in
the
west
they
had
been
among
its
first
explorers
and
they
hoped
that
here
the
catholic
faith
as
represented
by
jesuits
might
reign
with
undisputed
sway
in
paraguay
it
was
their
constant
aim
to
exclude
white
men
from
their
missions
it
was
the
same
in
north
america
they
dreaded
partly
because
they
interfered
with
their
teachings
and
perverted
their
converts
and
partly
for
other
reasons
but

path

was

soon
see
he
had
returned
to
france
in
prosecution
of
his
plans
the
writer
knew
the
sulpitian
galinée
who
as
he
says
had
a
very
high
opinion
of
la
salle
and
he
was
also
in
close
relations
with
the
discoverer
patron
the
prince
de
conti
he
says
that
he
had
ten
or
twelve
interviews
with
la
salle
and
becoming
interested
in
him
and
in
that
which
he
communicated
he
wrote
down
the
substance
of
his
conversation
the
paper
is
divided
into
two
parts
the
first
called
mémoire
sur
de
la
salle
is
devoted
to
the
state
of
affairs
in
canada
and
chiefly
to
the
jesuits
the
second
entitled
histoire
de
de
la
salle
is
an
account
of
the
discoverer
life
or
as
much
of
it
as
the
writer
had
learned
from
him
both
parts
bear
throughout
the
internal
evidence
of
being
what
they
profess
to
be
but
they
embody
the
statements
of
a
man
of
intense
partisan
feeling
transmitted
through
the
mind
of
another
person
in
sympathy
with
him
and
evidently
sharing
his
prepossessions
in
one
respect
however
the
paper
is
of
unquestionable
historical
value
for
it
gives
us
a
vivid
and
not
an
exaggerated
picture
of
the
bitter
strife
of
parties
which
then
raged
in
canada
and
which
was
destined
to
tax
to
the
utmost
the
vast
energy
and
fortitude
of
la
salle
at
times
the
memoir
is
fully
sustained
by
contemporary
evidence
but
often
again
it
rests
on
its
own
unsupported
authority
i
give
an
abstract
of
its
statements
as
i
find
them
the
following
is
the
writer
account
of
la
salle
all
those
among
my
friends
who
have
seen
him
find
him
a
man
of
great
intelligence
and
sense
he
rarely
speaks
of
any
subject
except
when
questioned
about
it
and
his
words
are
very
few
and
very
precise
he
distinguishes
perfectly
between
that
which
he
knows
with
certainly
and
that
which
he
knows
with
some
mingling
of
doubt
when
he
does
not
know
he
does
not
hesitate
to
avow
it
and
though
i
have
heard
him
say
the
same
thing
more
than
five
or
six
times
when
persons
were
present
who
had
not
heard
it
before
he
always
said
it
in
the
same
manner
in
short
i
never
heard
anybody
speak
whose
words
carried
with
them
more
marks
of
truth

after
mentioning
that
he
is
or
years
old
and
that
he
has
been
twelve
years
in

the
memoir
declares
that
he
made
the
following
statements
that
the
jesuits
are
masters
at
quebec
that
the
bishop
is
their
creature
and
does
nothing

in

with

towards

refused

and
that
he

had
himself
detected
them
in
it
that
the
bishop
laughs
at
the
orders
of
the

when
they
do
not
agree
with
the
wishes
of
the
jesuits
that
the
jesuits
dismissed
one
of
their
servants
named
robert
because
he
told
of
their
trade
in
brandy
that
albanel
in
particular
carried
on

and
that
the
jesuits
have
built
their
college
in
part
from
the
profits
of
this
kind
of

they
admitted
that
they

on

at

and
that

in

at

that
he
had
prayed
and
been

long
as

would
stay
and
teach
him

since
no

were
gone

themselves
in

call
them

accused
of
harshness
and
intolerance
as
well
as
of
growing
rich
by
tithes
and
even
by

it
is
affirmed

is
added
that

are
kept
while
no

discretion
is
observed
with

here
follow
a
series
of
statements
which
it
is
needless
to
repeat
as
they
do
not
concern
la

they
relate
to
abuse
of
the
confessional
hostility
to

hostility
to
civil
authorities
and

in

to
which

to
have
made

comparison
unfavorable
to
the
jesuits
between
them
and
the
récollets
and
sulpitians
sidenote
plots
against
la

we
now
come
to
the
second
part
of
the
memoir
entitled
history
of
monsieur
de
la
salle
after
stating
that
he
left
france
at
the
age
of
or
with
the
purpose
of
attempting
some
new
discovery
it
makes
the
statements
repeated
in
a
former
chapter
concerning
his
discovery
of
the
ohio
the
illinois
and
possibly
the
mississippi
it
then
mentions
the
building
of
fort
frontenac
and
says
that
one
object
of
it
was
to
prevent
the
jesuits
from
becoming
undisputed
masters
of
the
three
years
ago
it
pursues
la
salle
came
to
france
and
obtained
a
grant
of
the
fort
and
it
proceeds
to
give
examples
of
the
means
used
by
the
party
opposed
to
him
to
injure
his
good
name
and
bring
him
within
reach
of
the
law
once
when
he
was
at
quebec
the
farmer
of
the
king
revenue
one
of
the
richest
men
in
the
place
was
extremely
urgent
in
his
proffers
of
hospitality
and
at
length
though
he
knew
la
salle
but
slightly
persuaded
him
to
lodge
in
his
house
he
had
been
here
but
a
few
days
when
his
host
wife
began
to
enact
the
part
of
the
wife
of
potiphar
and
this
with
so
much
vivacity
that
on
one
occasion
la
salle
was
forced
to
take
an
abrupt
leave
in
order
to
avoid
an
infringement
of
the
laws
of
hospitality
as
he
opened
the
door
he
found
the
husband
on
the
watch
and
saw
that
it
was
a
plot
to
entrap
him
another
attack
of
a
different
character
though
in
the
same
direction
was
soon
after
made
the
remittances
which
la
salle
received
from
the
various
members
and
connections
of
his
family
were
sent
through
the
hands
of
his
brother
abbé
cavelier
from
whom
his
enemies
were
therefore
very
eager
to
alienate
him
to
this
end
a
report
was
made
to
reach
the
priest
ears
that
la
salle
had
seduced
a
young
woman
with
whom
he
was
living
in
an
open
and
scandalous
manner
at
fort
frontenac
the
effect
of
this
device
exceeded
the
wishes
of
its
contrivers
for
the
priest
aghast
at
what
he
had
heard
set
out
for
the
fort
to
administer
his
fraternal
rebuke
but
on
arriving
in
place
of
the
expected
abomination
found
his
brother
assisted
by
two
récollet
friars
ruling
with
edifying
propriety
over
a
most
exemplary
household
thus
far
the
memoir
from
passages
in
some
of
la
salle
letters
it
may
be
gathered
that
abbé
cavelier
gave
him
at
times
no
little
annoyance
in
his
double
character
of
priest
and
elder
brother
he
seems
to
have
constituted
himself
the
counsellor
monitor
and
guide
of
a
man
who
though
many
years
his
junior
was
in
all
respects
incomparably
superior
to
him
as
the
sequel
will
show
this
must
have
been
almost
insufferable
to
a
nature
like
that
of
la
salle
who
nevertheless
was
forced
to
arm
himself
with
patience
since
his
brother
held
the
on
one
occasion
his
forbearance
was
put
to
a
severe
proof
when
wishing
to
marry
a
damsel
of
good
connections
in
the
colony
abbé
cavelier
saw
fit
for
some
reason
to
interfere
and
prevented
the
alliance
sidenote
intrigues
of
the
jesuits
to
resume
the
memoir
it
declares
that
the
jesuits
procured
an
ordinance
from
the
supreme
council
prohibiting
traders
from
going
into
the
indian
country
in
order
that
they
the
jesuits
being
already
established
there
in
their
missions
might
carry
on
trade
without
competition
but
la
salle
induced
a
good
number
of
the
iroquois
to
settle
around
his
fort
thus
bringing
the
trade
to
his
own
door
without
breaking
the
ordinance
these
iroquois
he
is
further
reported
to
have
said
were
very
fond
of
him
and
aided
him
in
rebuilding
the
fort
with
cut
stone
the
jesuits
told
the
iroquois
on
the
south
side
of
the
lake
where
they
were
established
as
missionaries
that
la
salle
was
strengthening
his
defences
with
the
view
of
making
war
on
them
they
and
the
intendant
who
was
their
creature
endeavored
to
embroil
the
iroquois
with
the
french
in
order
to
ruin
la
salle
writing
to
him
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
the
bulwark
of
the
country
and
that
he
ought
to
be
always
on
his
guard
they
also
tried
to
persuade
frontenac
that
it
was
necessary
to
raise
men
and
prepare
for
war
la
salle
suspected
them
and
seeing
that
the
iroquois
in
consequence
of
their
intrigues
were
in
an
excited
state
he
induced
the
governor
to
come
to
fort
frontenac
to
pacify
them
he
accordingly
did
so
and
a
council
was
held
which
ended
in
a
complete
restoration
of
confidence
on
the
part
of
the
iroquois
at
this
council
they
accused
the
two
jesuits
bruyas
and
pierron
of
spreading
reports
that
the
french
were
preparing
to
attack
them
la
salle
thought
that
the
object
of
the
intrigue
was
to
make
the
iroquois
jealous
of
him
and
engage
frontenac
in
expenses
which
would
offend
the
king
after
la
salle
and
the
governor
had
lost
credit
by
the
rupture
the
jesuits
would
come
forward
as
pacificators
in
the
full
assurance
that
they
could
restore
quiet
and
appear
in
the
attitude
of
saviors
of
the
colony
la
salle
pursues
his
reporter
went
on
to
say
that
about
this
time
a
quantity
of
hemlock
and
verdigris
was
given
him
in
a
salad
and
that
the
guilty
person
was
a
man
in
his
employ
named
nicolas
perrot
otherwise
called
jolycoeur
who
confessed
the
crime
the
memoir
adds
that
la
salle
who
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
poison
wholly
exculpates
the
jesuits
this
attempt
which
was
not
as
we
shall
see
the
only
one
of
the
kind
made
against
la
salle
is
alluded
to
by
him
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
at
paris
written
in
canada
when
he
was
on
the
point
of
departure
on
his
great
expedition
to
descend
the
mississippi
the
following
is
an
extract
from
it
sidenote
la
salle
exculpates
the
jesuits
i
hope
to
give
myself
the
honor
of
sending
you
a
more
particular
account
of
this
enterprise
when
it
shall
have
had
the
success
which
i
hope
for
it
but
i
have
need
of
a
strong
protection
for
its
support
it
traverses
the
commercial
operations
of
certain
persons
who
will
find
it
hard
to
endure
it
they
intended
to
make
a
new
paraguay
in
these
parts
and
the
route
which
i
close
against
them
gave
them
facilities
for
an
advantageous
correspondence
with
mexico
this
check
will
infallibly
be
a
mortification
to
them
and
you
know
how
they
deal
with
whatever
opposes
them
i
am
bound
to
render
them
the
justice
to
say
that
the
poison
which
was
given
me
was
not
at
all
of
their
the
person
who
was
conscious
of
the
guilt
believing
that
i
was
their
enemy
because
he
saw
that
our
sentiments
were
opposed
thought
to
exculpate
himself
by
accusing
them
and
i
confess
that
at
the
time
i
was
not
sorry
to
have
this
indication
of
their
but
having
afterwards
carefully
examined
the
affair
i
clearly
discovered
the
falsity
of
the
accusation
which
this
rascal
had
made
against
them
i
nevertheless
pardoned
him
in
order
not
to
give
notoriety
to
the
affair
as
the
mere
suspicion
might
sully
their
reputation
to
which
i
should
scrupulously
avoid
doing
the
slightest
injury
unless
i
thought
it
necessary
to
the
good
of
the
public
and
unless
the
fact
were
fully
proved
therefore
monsieur
if
anybody
shared
the
suspicion
which
i
felt
oblige
me
by
undeceiving
him
this
letter
so
honorable
to
la
salle
explains
the
statement
made
in
the
memoir
that
notwithstanding
his
grounds
of
complaint
against
the
jesuits
he
continued
to
live
on
terms
of
courtesy
with
them
entertained
them
at
his
fort
and
occasionally
corresponded
with
them
the
writer
asserts
however
that
they
intrigued
with
his
men
to
induce
them
to
desert
employing
for
this
purpose
a
young
man
named
deslauriers
whom
they
sent
to
him
with
letters
of
recommendation
la
salle
took
him
into
his
service
but
he
soon
after
escaped
with
several
other
men
and
took
refuge
in
the
jesuit
missions
the
object
of
the
intrigue
is
said
to
have
been
the
reduction
of
la
salle
garrison
to
a
number
less
than
that
which
he
was
bound
to
maintain
thus
exposing
him
to
a
forfeiture
of
his
title
of
possession
sidenote
renewed
intrigues
he
is
also
stated
to
have
declared
that
louis
joliet
was
an
impostor
and
a
of
the
jesuits
that
is
a
man
who
worked
for
them
without
pay
and
further
that
when
he
la
salle
came
to
court
to
ask
for
privileges
enabling
him
to
pursue
his
discoveries
the
jesuits
represented
in
advance
to
the
minister
colbert
that
his
head
was
turned
and
that
he
was
fit
for
nothing
but
a
it
was
only
by
the
aid
of
influential
friends
that
he
was
at
length
enabled
to
gain
an
audience
here
ends
this
remarkable
memoir

may

la

memorial
it
was
not
solely
or
chiefly
for
commercial
gain
that
la
salle
had
established
fort
frontenac
he
regarded
it
as
a
first
step
towards
greater
things
and
now
at
length
his
plans
were
ripe
and
his
time
was
come
in
the
autumn
of
he
left
the
fort
in
charge
of
his
lieutenant
descended
the
lawrence
to
quebec
and
sailed
for
france
he
had
the
patronage
of
frontenac
and
the
help
of
strong
friends
in
paris
it
is
said
as
we
have
seen
already
that
his
enemies
denounced
him
in
advance
as
a
madman
but
a
memorial
of
his
which
his
friends
laid
before
the
minister
colbert
found
a
favorable
hearing
in
it
he
set
forth
his
plans
or
a
portion
of
them
he
first
recounted
briefly
the
discoveries
he
had
made
and
then
described
the
country
he
had
seen
south
and
west
of
the
great
lakes
it
is
nearly
all
so
beautiful
and
so
fertile
so
free
from
forests
and
so
full
of
meadows
brooks
and
rivers
so
abounding
in
fish
game
and
venison
that
one
can
find
there
in
plenty
and
with
little
trouble
all
that
is
needful
for
the
support
of
flourishing
colonies
the
soil
will
produce
everything
that
is
raised
in
france
flocks
and
herds
can
be
left
out
at
pasture
all
winter
and
there
are
even
native
wild
cattle
which
instead
of
hair
have
a
fine
wool
that
may
answer
for
making
cloth
and
hats
their
hides
are
better
than
those
of
france
as
appears
by
the
sample
which
the
sieur
de
la
salle
has
brought
with
him
hemp
and
cotton
grow
here
naturally
and
may
be
manufactured
with
good
results
so
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
colonies
planted
here
would
become
very
prosperous
they
would
be
increased
by
a
great
number
of
western
indians
who
are
in
the
main
of
a
tractable
and
social
disposition
and
as
they
have
the
use
neither
of
our
weapons
nor
of
our
goods
and
are
not
in
intercourse
with
other
europeans
they
will
readily
adapt
themselves
to
us
and
imitate
our
way
of
life
as
soon
as
they
taste
the
advantages
of
our
friendship
and
of
the
commodities
we
bring
them
insomuch
that
these
countries
will
infallibly
furnish
within
a
few
years
a
great
many
new
subjects
to
the
church
and
the
king
it
was
the
knowledge
of
these
things
joined
to
the
poverty
of
canada
its
dense
forests
its
barren
soil
its
harsh
climate
and
the
snow
that
covers
the
ground
for
half
the
year
that
led
the
sieur
de
la
salle
to
undertake
the
planting
of
colonies
in
these
beautiful
countries
of
the
west
then
he
recounts
the
difficulties
of
the
attempt
the
vast
distances
the
rapids
and
cataracts
that
obstruct
the
way
the
cost
of
men
provisions
and
munitions
the
danger
from
the
iroquois
and
the
rivalry
of
the
english
who
covet
the
western
country
and
would
gladly
seize
it
for
themselves
but
this
last
reason
says
the
memorial
only
animates
the
sieur
de
la
salle
the
more
and
impels
him
to
anticipate
them
by
the
promptness
of
his
action
he
declares
that
it
was
for
this
that
he
had
asked
for
the
grant
of
fort
frontenac
and
he
describes
what
he
had
done
at
that
post
in
order
to
make
it
a
secure
basis
for
his
enterprise
he
says
that
he
has
now
overcome
the
chief
difficulties
in
his
way
and
that
he
is
ready
to
plant
a
new
colony
at
the
outlet
of
lake
erie
of
which
the
english
if
not
prevented
might
easily
take
possession
towards
the
accomplishment
of
his
plans
he
asks
the
confirmation
of
his
title
to
fort
frontenac
and
the
permission
to
establish
at
his
own
cost
two
other
posts
with
seigniorial
rights
over
all
lands
which
he
may
discover
and
colonize
within
twenty
years
and
the
government
of
all
the
country
in
question
on
his
part
he
proposes
to
renounce
all
share
in
the
trade
carried
on
between
the
tribes
of
the
upper
lakes
and
the
people
of
canada
la
salle
seems
to
have
had
an
interview
with
the
minister
in
which
the
proposals
of
his
memorial
were
somewhat
modified
he
soon
received
in
reply
the
following
patent
from
the

we
have
received

the
very

petition
made
us
in
your

to
permit
you
to
labor
at
the
discovery
of
the
western
parts
of
new
france
and
we
have
the
more
willingly
entertained
this
proposal
since
we
have
nothing
more
at
heart
than
the
exploration
of
this
country
through
which
to
all
appearance
a
way
may
be
found
to
mexico
for
this
and
other
causes
thereunto
moving
us
we
permit
you
by
these
presents
signed
with
our
hand
to
labor
at
the
discovery
of
the
western
parts
of
our
aforesaid
country
of
new
france
and
for
the
execution
of
this
enterprise
to
build
forts
at
such
places
as
you
may
think
necessary
and
enjoy
possession
thereof
under
the
same
clauses
and
conditions
as
of
fort
frontenac
conformably
to
our
letters
patent
of
may
thirteenth
which
so
far
as
needful
we
confirm
by
these
presents
and
it
is
our
will
that
they
be
executed
according
to
their
form
and
tenor
on
condition
nevertheless
that
you
finish
this
enterprise
within
five
years
failing
which
these
presents
shall
be
void
and
of
no
effect
that
you
carry
on
no
trade
with
the
savages
called
ottawas
or
with
other
tribes
who
bring
their
peltries
to
montreal
and
that
you
do
the
whole
at
your
own
cost
and
that
of
your
associates
to
whom
we
have
granted
the
sole
right
of

to

to
the
execution
of
these
presents
for
such
is
our
pleasure
given
at
germain

this
day
of
may
and
of
our
reign
the
year
this
patent
grants
both
more
and
less
than
the
memorial
had
asked
it
authorizes
la

to
build
and
own
not
two
forts
only
but
as
many
as
he
may
see
fit
provided
that
he
do
so
within
five
years
and
it
gives
him
besides
the
monopoly
of
for
which
at
first
he
had
not

in

partly
as
tending
to
deplete

and
partly
as
removing
his
subjects
too
far
from
his
paternal
control
it
was
but
the
year
before
that
he
refused
to
louis
joliet
the
permission
to
plant
a
trading
station
in
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
la
salle
however
still
held
to
his
plan
of
a
commercial
and
industrial
colony
and
in
connection
with
it
to
another
purpose
of
which
his
memorial
had
made
no
mention
this
was
the
building
of
a
vessel
on
some
branch
of
the
mississippi
in
order
to
sail
down
that
river
to
its
mouth
and
open
a
route
to
commerce
through
the
gulf
of
mexico
it
is
evident
that
this
design
was
already
formed
for
he
had
no
sooner
received
his
patent
than
he
engaged
and
procured
iron
cordage
and
anchors
not
for
one
vessel
but
for
two
sidenote
money
and
means
what
he
now
most
needed
was
money
and
having
none
of
his
own
he
set
himself
to
raising
it
from
others
a
notary
named
simonnet
lent
him
four
thousand
livres
an
advocate
named
raoul
thousand
and
one
dumont
six
thousand
his
cousin
françois
plet
a
merchant
of
rue
martin
lent
him
about
eleven
thousand
at
the
interest
of
forty
per
cent
and
when
he
returned
to
canada
frontenac
found
means
to
procure
him
another
loan
of
about
fourteen
thousand
secured
by
the
mortgage
of
fort
frontenac
but
his
chief
helpers
were
his
family
who
became
sharers
in
his
undertaking
his
brothers
and
relations
says
a
memorial
afterwards
addressed
by
them
to
the
king
spared
nothing
to
enable
him
to
respond
worthily
to
the
royal
goodness
and
the
document
adds
that
before
his
allotted
five
years
were
ended
his
discoveries
had
cost
them
more
than
five
hundred
thousand
livres
francs
la
salle
himself
believed
and
made
others
believe
that
there
was
more
profit
than
risk
in
his
schemes
lodged
rather
obscurely
in
rue
de
la
truanderie
and
of
a
nature
reserved
and
shy
he
nevertheless
found
countenance
and
support
from
personages
no
less
exalted
than
colbert
seignelay
and
the
prince
de
conti
others
too
in
stations
less
conspicuous
warmly
espoused
his
cause
and
none
more
so
than
the
learned
abbé
renaudot
who
helped
him
with
tongue
and
pen
and
seems
to
have
been
instrumental
in
introducing
to
him
a
man
who
afterwards
proved
invaluable
this
was
henri
de
tonty
an
italian
officer
a
of
the
prince
de
conti
who
sent
him
to
la
salle
as
a
person
suited
to
his
purposes
tonty
had
but
one
hand
the
other
having
been
blown
off
by
a
grenade
in
the
sicilian
wars
his
father
who
had
been
governor
of
gaeta
but
who
had
come
to
france
in
consequence
of
political
disturbances
in
naples
had
earned
no
small
reputation
as
a
financier
and
had
invented
the
form
of
life
insurance
still
called
the
tontine
la
salle
learned
to
know
his
new
lieutenant
on
the
voyage
across
the
atlantic
and
soon
after
reaching
canada
he
wrote
of
him
to
his
patron
in
the
following
terms
his
honorable
character
and
his
amiable
disposition
were
well
known
to
you
but
perhaps
you
would
not
have
thought
him
capable
of
doing
things
for
which
a
strong
constitution
an
acquaintance
with
the
country
and
the
use
of
both
hands
seemed
absolutely
necessary
nevertheless
his
energy
and
address
make
him
equal
to
anything
and
now
at
a
season
when
everybody
is
in
fear
of
the
ice
he
is
setting
out
to
begin
a
new
fort
two
hundred
leagues
from
this
place
and
to
which
i
have
taken
the
liberty
to
give
the
name
of

it
is
situated
near

than

delays
occurred
bellinzani
director
of

who
had
formerly
taken

in
rascality
in

abused
his
official
position
to
throw
obstacles
in

in

to

money
from
him
and
he
extorted
in

a
considerable

his

afterwards
reclaimed
it
was
not
till
the
fourteenth
of

that

two
months
more

to

seems
to
have

to

satisfaction
la

gave
him
a
letter
from
his
provincial
father
le

containing
the

permission
whereupon
to
prepare
himself
he
went
into
retreat
at
the

where
he
remained
for
a
time
in
such
prayer
and
meditation
as

nature
the
reverse

would
permit

always
partial
to

then
invited
him
to

and

he

set
forth
on

journey
he
carried
with
him
the
furniture
of
a
portable
altar
which
in
time
of
need
he
could
strap
on
his
back
like
a
knapsack
he
slowly
made
his
way
up
the
lawrence
stopping
here
and
there
where
a
clearing
and
a
few
log
houses
marked
the
feeble
beginning
of
a
parish
and
a
seigniory
the
settlers
though
good
catholics
were
too
few
and
too
poor
to
support
a
priest
and
hailed
the
arrival
of
the

with
delight
he
said
mass
exhorted
a
little
as
was
his
custom
and
on

occasion
baptized
a

at

he
reached

the

enticed
away

he
succeeded
in
finding

others
with
whom
he
continued
his
voyage
passed
the
rapids
of

and
reached

at

at

in

this
bold
hardy
and
adventurous
friar
the
historian
of
the
expedition
and
a
conspicuous
actor
in
it
has
unwittingly
painted
his
own
portrait
with
tolerable
distinctness
i
always
he
says
felt
a
strong
inclination
to
fly
from
the
world
and
live
according
to
the
rules
of
a
pure
and
severe
virtue
and
it
was
with
this
view
that
i
entered
the
order
of
st
francis
he
then
speaks
of
his
zeal
for
the
saving
of
souls
but
admits
that
a
passion
for
travel
and
a
burning
desire
to
visit
strange
lands
had
no
small
part
in
his
inclination
for
the
missions
being
in
a
convent
in
artois
his
superior
sent
him
to
calais
at
the
season
of
the
to
beg
alms
after
the
practice
of
the
franciscans
here
and
at
dunkirk
he
made
friends
of
the
sailors
and
was
never
tired
of
their
stories
so
insatiable
indeed
was
his
appetite
for
them
that
often
he
says
i
hid
myself
behind
tavern
doors
while
the
sailors
were
telling
of
their
voyages
the
tobacco
smoke
made
me
very
sick
at
the
stomach
but
notwithstanding
i
listened
attentively
to
all
they
said
about
their
adventures
at
sea
and
their
travels
in
distant
countries
i
could
have
passed
whole
days
and
nights
in
this
way
without
eating
he
presently
set
out
on
a
roving
mission
through
holland
and
he
recounts
various
mishaps
which
befell
him
in
consequence
of
my
zeal
in
laboring
for
the
saving
of
souls
i
was
at
the
bloody
fight
of
seneff
he
pursues
where
so
many
perished
by
fire
and
sword
and
where
i
had
abundance
of
work
in
comforting
and
consoling
the
poor
wounded
soldiers
after
undergoing
great
fatigues
and
running
extreme
danger
in
the
sieges
of
towns
in
the
trenches
and
in
battles
where
i
exposed
myself
freely
for
the
salvation
of
others
while
the
soldiers
were
breathing
nothing
but
blood
and
carnage
i
found
myself
at
last
in
a
way
of
satisfying
my
old
inclination
for
travel
he
got
leave
from
his
superiors
to
go
to
canada
the
most
adventurous
of
all
the
missions
and
accordingly
sailed
in
in
the
ship
which
carried
la
salle
who
had
just
obtained
the
grant
of
fort
frontenac
in
the
course
of
the
voyage
he
took
it
upon
him
to
reprove
a
party
of
girls
who
were
amusing
themselves
and
a
circle
of
officers
and
other
passengers
by
dancing
on
deck
la
salle
who
was
among
the
spectators
was
annoyed
at
hennepin
interference
and
told
him
that
he
was
behaving
like
a
pedagogue
the
friar
retorted
by
alluding
unconsciously
as
he
says
to
the
circumstance
that
la
salle
was
once
a
pedagogue
himself
having
according
to
hennepin
been
for
ten
or
twelve
years
teacher
of
a
class
in
a
jesuit
school
la
salle
he
adds
turned
pale
with
rage
and
never
forgave
him
to
his
dying
day
but
always
maligned
and
persecuted
him
on
arriving
in
canada
he
was
sent
up
to
fort
frontenac
as
a
missionary
that
wild
and
remote
post
was
greatly
to
his
liking
he
planted
a
gigantic
cross
superintended
the
building
of
a
chapel
for
himself
and
his
colleague
buisset
and
instructed
the
iroquois
colonists
of
the
place
he
visited
too
the
neighboring
indian
settlements
paddling
his
canoe
in
summer
when
the
lake
was
open
and
journeying
in
winter
on
with
a
blanket
slung
at
his
back
his
most
noteworthy
journey
was
one
which
he
made
in
the
winter
apparently
of
with
a
soldier
of
the
fort
they
crossed
the
eastern
extremity
of
lake
ontario
on
and
pushed
southward
through
the
forests
towards
onondaga
stopping
at
evening
to
dig
away
the
snow
which
was
several
feet
deep
and
collect
wood
for
their
fire
which
they
were
forced
to
replenish
repeatedly
during
the
night
to
keep
themselves
from
freezing
at
length
they
reached
the
great
onondaga
town
where
the
indians
were
much
amazed
at
their
hardihood
thence
they
proceeded
eastward
to
the
oneidas
and
afterwards
to
the
mohawks
who
regaled
them
with
small
frogs
pounded
up
with
a
porridge
of
indian
corn
here
hennepin
found
the
jesuit
bruyas
who
permitted
him
to
copy
a
dictionary
of
the
mohawk
language
which
he
had
compiled
and
here
he
presently
met
three
dutchmen
who
urged
him
to
visit
the
neighboring
settlement
of
orange
or
albany
an
invitation
which
he
seems
to
have
declined
they
were
pleased
with
him
he
says
because
he
spoke
dutch
bidding
them
farewell
he
tied
on
his
again
and
returned
with
his
companion
to
fort
frontenac
thus
he
inured
himself
to
the
hardships
of
the
woods
and
prepared
for
the
execution
of
the
grand
plan
of
discovery
which
he
calls
his
own
an
enterprise
to
borrow
his
own
words
capable
of
terrifying
anybody
but
me
when
the
later
editions
of
his
book
appeared
doubts
had
been
expressed
of
his
veracity
i
here
protest
to
you
before
god
he
writes
addressing
the
reader
that
my
narrative
is
faithful
and
sincere
and
that
you
may
believe
everything
related
in
it
and
yet
as
we
shall
see
this
reverend
father
was
the
most
impudent
of
liars
and
the
narrative
of
which
he
speaks
is
a
rare
monument
of
brazen
mendacity
hennepin
however
had
seen
and
dared
much
for
among
his
many
failings
fear
had
no
part
and
where
his
vanity
or
his
spite
was
not
involved
he
often
told
the
truth
his
books
have
their
value
with
all
their
enormous
fabrications
la
motte
and
hennepin
with
sixteen
men
went
on
board
the
little
vessel
of
ten
tons
which
lay
at
fort
frontenac
the
friar
two
brethren
buisset
and
ribourde
threw
their
arms
about
his
neck
as
they
bade
him
farewell
while
his
indian
proselytes
learning
whither
he
was
bound
stood
with
their
hands
pressed
upon
their
mouths
in
amazement
at
the
perils
which
awaited
their
ghostly
instructor
la
salle
with
the
rest
of
the
party
was
to
follow
as
soon
as
he
could
finish
his
preparations
it
was
a
boisterous
and
gusty
day
the
eighteenth
of
november
the
sails
were
spread
the
shore
receded
the
stone
walls
of
the
fort
the
huge
cross
that
the
friar
had
reared
the
wigwams
the
settlers
cabins
the
group
of
staring
indians
on
the
strand
the
lake
was
rough
and
the
men
crowded
in
so
small
a
craft
grew
nervous
and
uneasy
they
hugged
the
northern
shore
to
escape
the
fury
of
the
wind
which
blew
savagely
from
the
northeast
while
the
long
gray
sweep
of
naked
forests
on
their
right
betokened
that
winter
was
fast
closing
in
on
the
they
reached
the
neighborhood
of
the
indian
town
of
taiaiagon
not
far
from
toronto
and
ran
their
vessel
for
safety
into
the
mouth
of
a
river
probably
the
humber
where
the
ice
closed
about
her
and
they
were
forced

called
on

was
busied
in

a

accordingly
set

was
greatly
annoyed
at
seeing

and
when
the

assembled
to
hear
what

had
to

he
insisted
that
the
two

should
leave

scarlet

used
all
his

to

that
the
building
of
a
fort
on
the
banks
of
the
niagara
and
a
vessel
on

were
measures
vital
to
their
interest
they
gladly
took
the

but
answered
the

with
evasive
generalities
and
having
been
entertained
with
the
burning
of
an

the
discomfited

returned

he
appears
to
have
arrived
just
after
the
departure
of

hennepin
he
too
called
them
to
a
council
and
tried
to
soothe
the
extreme
jealousy
with
which
they
regarded
his
proceedings

told

says

gave
the
best
pretexts
i
could

gone
up

to
find
a

for
a
when
he
learned
that
the

in

of
the

he
had
left
had
disobeyed
his
orders
and
ended
by
wrecking
it

little
was
saved
except
the
anchors
and
cables
destined
for
the
new

to
be
built
above

this
loss
threw
him
into
extreme
perplexity
and
as
hennepin
says
would
have
made
anybody
but
him
give
up

the
whole

on

with
amazement
five
small
cannon
looked
out
from

portholes
and
on
her
prow
was
carved
a
portentous
monster
the
griffin
whose
name
she
bore
in
honor
of
the
armorial
bearings
of
frontenac
la

had
often
been
heard
to
say
that
he
would
make
the
griffin
fly
above
the
crows
or
in
other
words
make
frontenac
triumph
over
the
jesuits
they
now
took
her
up
the
river
and
made
her
fast
below
the
swift
current
at
black
rock
here
they
finished
her
equipment
and
waited
for
la

return
but
the
absent
commander
did
not
appear
the
spring
and
more
than
half
of
the
summer
had
passed
before
they
saw
him
again
at
length
early
in
august
he
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
the
niagara
bringing
three
more
friars
for
though
no
friend
of
the
jesuits
he
was
zealous
for
the
faith
and
was
rarely
without
a
missionary
in
his
journeyings
like
hennepin
the
three
friars
were
all
flemings
one
of
them
melithon
watteau
was
to
remain
at

the
others
zenobe

and
gabriel
ribourde
were
to
preach
the
faith
among
the
tribes
of

ribourde

a

and
cheerful
old

of

went
four
times
up
and
down
the
lewiston
heights
while
the
men
were
climbing
the
steep
pathway
with
their
loads
it
required
four
of
them
well
stimulated
with
brandy
to
carry
up
the
principal
anchor
destined
for
the
griffin
la
salle
brought
a
tale
of
disaster
his
enemies
bent
on
ruining
the
enterprise
had
given
out
that
he
was
embarked
on
a
harebrained
venture
from
which
he
would
never
return
his
creditors
excited
by
rumors
set
afloat
to
that
end
had
seized
on
all
his
property
in
the
settled
parts
of
canada
though
his
seigniory
of
fort
frontenac
alone
would
have
more
than
sufficed
to
pay
all
his
debts
there
was
no
remedy
to
defer
the
enterprise
would
have
been
to
give
his
adversaries
the
triumph
that
they
sought
and
he
hardened
himself
against
the
blow
with
his
usual
stoicism
footnotes
it
has
been
a
matter
of
debate
on
which
side
of
the
niagara
the
first
vessel
on
the
upper
lakes
was
built
a
close
study
of
hennepin
and
a
careful
examination
of
the
localities
have
convinced
me
that
the
spot
was
that
indicated
above
hennepin
repeatedly
alludes
to
a
large
detached
rock
rising
out
of
the
water
at
the
foot
of
the
rapids
above
lewiston
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
this
rock
may
still
be
seen
immediately
under
the
western
end
of
the
lewiston
persons
living
in
the
neighborhood
remember
that
a
used
to
pass
between
it
and
the
cliffs
of
the
western
shore
but
it
has
since
been
undermined
by
the
current
and
has
inclined
in
that
direction
so
that
a
considerable
part
of
it
is
submerged
while
the
gravel
and
earth
thrown
down
from
the
cliff
during
the
building
of
the
bridge
has
filled
the
intervening
channel
opposite
to
this
rock
and
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
says
hennepin
are
three
mountains
about
two
leagues
below
the
cataract
to
these
three
mountains
as
well
as
to
the
rock
he
frequently
alludes
they
are
also
spoken
of
by
la
hontan
who
clearly
indicates
their
position
they
consist
in
the
three
successive
grades
of
the
acclivity
first
that
which
rises
from
the
level
of
the
water
forming
the
steep
and
lofty
next
an
intermediate
ascent
crowned
by
a
sort
of
terrace
where
the
tired
men
could
find
a
second
and
lay
down
their
burdens
whence
a
third
effort
carried
them
with
difficulty
to
the
level
top
of
the
plateau
that
this
was
the
actual
portage
or
carrying
place
of
the
travellers
is
shown
by
hennepin
who
describes
the
carrying
of
anchors
and
other
heavy
articles
up
these
heights
in
august
la
hontan
also
passed
the
falls
by
way
of
the
three
mountains
eight
years
later
la
hontan
it
is
clear
then
that
the
portage
was
on
the
east
side
whence
it
would
be
safe
to
conclude
that
the
vessel
was
built
on
the
same
side
hennepin
says
that
she
was
built
at
the
mouth
of
a
stream
entering
the
niagara
two
leagues
above
the
falls
excepting
one
or
two
small
brooks
there
is
no
stream
on
the
west
side
but
chippewa
creek
which
hennepin
had
visited
and
correctly
placed
at
about
a
league
from
the
cataract
his
distances
on
the
niagara
are
usually
correct
on
the
east
side
there
is
a
stream
which
perfectly
answers
the
conditions
this
is
cayuga
creek
two
leagues
above
the
falls
immediately
in
front
of
it
is
an
island
about
a
mile
long
separated
from
the
shore
by
a
narrow
and
deep
arm
of
the
niagara
into
which
cayuga
creek
discharges
itself
the
place
is
so
obviously
suited
to
building
and
launching
a
vessel
that
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
the
government
of
the
united
states
chose
it
for
the
construction
of
a
schooner
to
carry
supplies
to
the
garrisons
of
the
upper
lakes
the
neighboring
village
now
bears
the
name
of
la

in
examining
this
and
other
localities
on
the
niagara
i
have
been
greatly
aided
by
my
friend

of
buffalo
who
is
unrivalled
in
his
knowledge
of
the
history
and
traditions
of
the
niagara
frontier
hennepin

drawn
up
at
the
instance
of
the
intendant
duchesneau
the
names
of
the
greater
number

are
preserved
these
agree
with
those
given
by

thus
the
whom

calls
maître

appears
as
moïse

and
the
blacksmith
whom
he
calls

is
mentioned
as

kindness
of

he
declared
himself
ready
to

found
several

a
rash
resolution

trusting

already
proved
either
incompetent

fired
a

on

on
pumpkins
and
indian
corn
the
gift
of
their
pottawattamie
friends
and
on
a
canada
porcupine
brought
in
by
la
salle
mohegan
hunter
the
gale
raged
meanwhile
with
relentless
fury
they
trembled
when
they
thought
of
the
griffin
when
at
length
the
tempest
lulled
they
and
steered
southward
along
the
shore
of
wisconsin
but
again
the
storm
fell
upon
them
and
drove
them
for
safety
to
a
bare
rocky
islet
here
they
made
a
fire
of
crouched
around
it
drew
their
blankets
over
their
heads
and
in
this
miserable
plight
pelted
with
sleet
and
rain
remained
for
two
days
at
length
they
were
afloat
again
but
their
prosperity
was
brief
on
the
a
fierce
squall
drove
them
to
a
point
of
rocks
covered
with
bushes
where
they
consumed
the
little
that
remained
of
their
provisions
on
the
first
of
october
they
paddled
about
thirty
miles
without
food
when
they
came
to
a
village
of
pottawattamies
who
ran
down
to
the
shore
to
help
them
to
land
but
la
salle
fearing
that
some
of
his
men
would
steal
the
merchandise
and
desert
to
the
indians
insisted
on
going
three
leagues
farther
to
the
great
indignation
of
his
followers
the
lake
swept
by
an
easterly
gale
was
rolling
its
waves
against
the
beach
like
the
ocean
in
a
storm
in
the
attempt
to
land
la
salle
canoe
was
nearly
swamped
he
and
his
three
leaped
into
the
water
and
in
spite
of
the
surf
which
nearly
drowned
them
dragged
their
vessel
ashore
with
all
its
load
he
then
went
to
the
rescue
of
hennepin
who
with
his
awkward
companion
was
in
woful
need
of
succor
father
gabriel
with
his
years
was
no
match
for
the
surf
and
the
violent
undertow
hennepin
finding
himself
safe
waded
to
his
relief
and
carried
him
ashore
on
his
sturdy
shoulders
while
the
old
friar
though
drenched
to
the
skin
laughed
gayly
under
his
cowl
as
his
brother
missionary
staggered
with
him
up
the
beach
when
all
were
safe
ashore
la
salle
who
distrusted
the
indians
they
had
passed
took
post
on
a
hill
and
ordered
his
followers
to
prepare
their
guns
for
action
nevertheless
as
they
were
starving
an
effort
must
be
risked
to
gain
a
supply
of
food
and
he
sent
three
men
back
to
the
village
to
purchase
it
well
armed
but
faint
with
toil
and
famine
they
made
their
way
through
the
stormy
forest
bearing
a
pipe
of
peace
but
on
arriving
saw
that
the
scared
inhabitants
had
fled
they
found
however
a
stock
of
corn
of
which
they
took
a
portion
leaving
goods
in
exchange
and
then
set
out
on
their
return
meanwhile
about
twenty
of
the
warriors
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
approached
the
camp
of
the
french
to
reconnoitre
la
salle
went
to
meet
them
with
some
of
his
men
opened
a
parley
with
them
and
kept
them
seated
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
till
his
three
messengers
returned
when
on
seeing
the
the
warriors
set
up
a
cry
of
joy
in
the
morning
they
brought
more
corn
to
the
camp
with
a
supply
of
fresh
venison
not
a
little
cheering
to
the
exhausted
frenchmen
who
in
dread
of
treachery
had
stood
under
arms
all
night
sidenote
hardships
this
was
no
journey
of
pleasure
the
lake
was
ruffled
with
almost
ceaseless
storms
clouds
big
with
rain
above
a
turmoil
of
gray
and
gloomy
waves
beneath
every
night
the
canoes
must
be
shouldered
through
the
breakers
and
dragged
up
the
steep
banks
which
as
they
neared
the
site
of
milwaukee
became
almost
insurmountable
the
men
paddled
all
day
with
no
other
food
than
a
handful
of
indian
corn
they
were
spent
with
toil
sick
with
the
haws
and
wild
berries
which
they
ravenously
devoured
and
dejected
at
the
prospect
before
them
father
good
spirits
began
to
fail
he
fainted
several
times
from
famine
and
fatigue
but
was
revived
by
a
certain
confection
of
hyacinth
administered
by
hennepin
who
had
a
small
box
of
this
precious
specific
at
length
they
descried
at
a
distance
on
the
stormy
shore
two
or
three
eagles
among
a
busy
congregation
of
crows
or
turkey
buzzards
they
paddled
in
all
haste
to
the
spot
the
feasters
took
flight
and
the
starved
travellers
found
the
mangled
body
of
a
deer
lately
killed
by
the
wolves
this
good
luck
proved
the
inauguration
of
plenty
as
they
approached
the
head
of
the
lake
game
grew
abundant
and
with
the
aid
of
the
mohegan
there
was
no
lack
of
bear
meat
and
venison
they
found
wild
grapes
too
in
the
woods
and
gathered
them
by
cutting
down
the
trees
to
which
the
vines
clung
sidenote
encounter
with
indians
while
thus
employed
they
were
startled
by
a
sight
often
so
fearful
in
the
waste
and
the
wilderness
the
print
of
a
human
foot
it
was
clear
that
indians
were
not
far
off
a
strict
watch
was
kept
not
as
it
proved
without
cause
for
that
night
while
the
sentry
thought
of
little
but
screening
himself
and
his
gun
from
the
floods
of
rain
a
party
of
outagamies
crept
under
the
bank
where
they
lurked
for
some
time
before
he
discovered
them
being
challenged
they
came
forward
professing
great
friendship
and
pretending
to
have
mistaken
the
french
for
iroquois
in
the
morning
however
there
was
an
outcry
from
la
salle
servant
who
declared
that
the
visitors
had
stolen
his
coat
from
under
the
inverted
canoe
where
he
had
placed
it
while
some
of
the
carpenters
also
complained
of
being
robbed
la
salle
well
knew
that
if
the
theft
were
left
unpunished
worse
would
come
of
it
first
he
posted
his
men
at
the
woody
point
of
a
peninsula
whose
sandy
neck
was
interposed
between
them
and
the
main
forest
then
he
went
forth
pistol
in
hand
met
a
young
outagami
seized
him
and
led
him
prisoner
to
his
camp
this
done
he
again
set
out
and
soon
found
an
outagami
chief
for
the
wigwams
were
not
far
distant
to
whom
he
told
what
he
had
done
adding
that
unless
the
stolen
goods
were
restored
the
prisoner
should
be
killed
the
indians
were
in
perplexity
for
they
had
cut
the
coat
to
pieces
and
divided
it
in
this
dilemma
they
resolved
being
strong
in
numbers
to
rescue
their
comrade
by
force
accordingly
they
came
down
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
or
posted
themselves
behind
fallen
trees
on
the
banks
while
la
salle
men
in
their
stronghold
braced
their
nerves
for
the
fight
here
three
flemish
friars
with
their
rosaries
and
eleven
frenchmen
with
their
guns
confronted
a
hundred
and
twenty
screeching
outagamies
hennepin
who
had
seen
service
and
who
had
always
an
exhortation
at
his
tongue
end
busied
himself
to
inspire
the
rest
with
a
courage
equal
to
his
own
neither
party
however
had
an
appetite
for
the
fray
a
parley
ensued
full
compensation
was
made
for
the
stolen
goods
and
the
aggrieved
frenchmen
were
farther
propitiated
with
a
gift
of
their
late
enemies
now
become
friends
spent
the
next
day
in
dances
feasts
and
speeches
they
entreated
la
salle
not
to
advance
farther
since
the
illinois
through
whose
country
he
must
pass
would
be
sure
to
kill
him
for
added
these
friendly
counsellors
they
hated
the
french
because
they
had
been
instigating
the
iroquois
to
invade
their
country
here
was
another
subject
of
anxiety
la
salle
was
confirmed
in
his
belief
that
his
busy
and
unscrupulous
enemies
were
intriguing
for
his
destruction
he
pushed
on
however
circling
around
the
southern
shore
of
lake
michigan
till
he
reached
the
mouth
of
the
joseph
called
by
him
the
miamis
here
tonty
was
to
have
rejoined
him
with
twenty
men
making
his
way
from
michilimackinac
along
the
eastern
shore
of
the
lake
but
the
rendezvous
was
a
solitude
tonty
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
it
was
the
first
of
november
winter
was
at
hand
and
the
streams
would
soon
be
frozen
the
men
clamored
to
go
forward
urging
that
they
should
starve
if
they
could
not
reach
the
villages
of
the
illinois
before
the
tribe
scattered
for
the
winter
hunt
la
salle
was
inexorable
if
they
should
all
desert
he
said
he
with
his
mohegan
hunter
and
the
three
friars
would
still
remain
and
wait
for
tonty
the
men
grumbled
but
obeyed
and
to
divert
their
thoughts
he
set
them
at
building
a
fort
of
timber
on
a
rising
ground
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
they
had
spent
twenty
days
at
this
task
and
their
work
was
well
advanced
when
at
length
tonty
appeared
he
brought
with
him
only
half
of
his
men
provisions
had
failed
and
the
rest
of
his
party
had
been
left
thirty
leagues
behind
to
sustain
themselves
by
hunting
la
salle
told
him
to
return
and
hasten
them
forward
he
set
out
with
two
men
a
violent
north
wind
arose
he
tried
to
run
his
canoe
ashore
through
the
breakers
the
two
men
could
not
manage
their
vessel
and
he
with
his
one
hand
could
not
help
them
she
swamped
rolling
over
in
the
surf
guns
baggage
and
provisions
were
lost
and
the
three
voyagers
returned
to
the
miamis
subsisting
on
acorns
by
the
way
happily
the
men
left
behind
excepting
two
deserters
succeeded
a
few
days
after
in
rejoining
the
party
sidenote
forebodings
thus
was
one
heavy
load
lifted
from
the
heart
of
la

but
where
was
the
griffin
time
enough
and
more
than
enough
had
passed
for
her
voyage
to
niagara
and
back
again
he
scanned
the
dreary
horizon
with
an
anxious
eye
no
returning
sail
gladdened
the
watery
solitude
and
a
dark
foreboding
gathered
on
his
heart
yet
further
delay
was
impossible
he
sent
back
two
men
to
michilimackinac
to
meet
her
if
she
still
existed
and
pilot
her
to
his
new
fort
of
the

and
then
prepared
to
ascend
the

weedy
edges
were
already
glassed
with
thin
flakes

with

when
they
approached

they
looked
anxiously
along

on

right
to

in

powdered
by

they
sat
ruefully
speculating
as
to
what
had
befallen
him
nor
was
it
till
four
of
the
next
afternoon
that
they
saw
him
approaching
along
the
margin
of
the
river
his
face
and
hands
were
besmirched
with
charcoal
and
he
was
further
decorated
with
two
opossums
which
hung
from
his
belt
and
which
he
had
killed
with
a
stick
as
they
were
swinging
head
downwards
from
the
bough
of
a
tree
after
the
fashion
of
that
singular
beast
he
had
missed
his
way
in
the
forest
and
had
been
forced
to
make
a
wide
circuit
around
the
edge
of
a
swamp
while
the
snow
of
which
the
air
was
full
added
to
his
perplexities
thus
he
pushed
on
through
the
rest
of
the
day
and
the
greater
part
of
the
night
till
about
two
in
the
morning
he
reached
the
river
again
and
fired
his
gun
as
a
signal
to
his
party
hearing
no
answering
shot
he
pursued
his
way
along
the
bank
when
he
presently
saw
the
gleam
of
a
fire
among
the
dense
thickets
close
at
hand
not
doubting
that
he
had
found
the
bivouac
of
his
party
he
hastened
to
the
spot
to
his
surprise
no
human
being
was
to
be
seen
under
a
tree
beside
the
fire
was
a
heap
of
dry
grass
impressed
with
the
form
of
a
man
who
must
have
fled
but
a
moment
before
for
his
couch
was
still
warm
it
was
no
doubt
an
indian
ambushed
on
the
bank
watching
to
kill
some
passing
enemy
la
salle
called
out
in
several
indian
languages
but
there
was
dead
silence
all
around
he
then
with
admirable
coolness
took
possession
of
the
quarters
he
had
found
shouting
to
their
invisible
proprietor
that
he
was
about
to
sleep
in
his
bed
piled
a
barricade
of
bushes
around
the
spot
rekindled
the
dying
fire
warmed
his
benumbed
hands
stretched
himself
on
the
dried
grass
and
slept
undisturbed
till
morning
the
mohegan
had
rejoined
the
party
before
la

return
and
with
his
aid
the
portage
was
soon
found
here
the
party
encamped
la
salle
who
was
excessively
fatigued
occupied
together
with
hennepin
a
wigwam
covered
in
the
indian
manner
with
mats
of
reeds
the
cold
forced
them
to
kindle
a
fire
which
before
daybreak
set
the
mats
in
a
blaze
and
the
two
sleepers
narrowly
escaped
being
burned
along
with
their
hut
sidenote
the
kankakee
in
the
morning
the
party
shouldered
their
canoes
and
baggage
and
began
their
march
for
the
sources
of
the
river
illinois
some
five
miles
distant
around
them
stretched
a
desolate
plain
with
snow
and
strewn
with
the
skulls
and
bones
of
buffalo
while
on
its
farthest
verge
they
could
see
the
lodges
of
the
miami
indians
who
had
made
this
place
their
abode
as
they
filed
on
their
way
a
man
named
duplessis
bearing
a
grudge
against
la
salle
who
walked
just
before
him
raised
his
gun
to
shoot
him
through
the
back
but
was
prevented
by
one
of
his
comrades
they
soon
reached
a
spot
where
the
oozy
saturated
soil
quaked
beneath
their
tread
all
around
were
clumps
of
tufts
of
rank
grass
and
pools
of
glistening
water
in
the
midst
a
dark
and
lazy
current
which
a
tall
man
might
bestride
crept
twisting
like
a
snake
among
the
weeds
and
rushes
here
were
the
sources
of
the
kankakee
one
of
the
heads
of
the
illinois
they
set
their
canoes
on
this
thread
of
water
embarked
their
baggage
and
themselves
and
pushed
down
the
sluggish
streamlet
looking
at
a
little
distance
like
men
who
sailed
on
land
fed
by
an
unceasing
tribute
of
the
spongy
soil
it
quickly
widened
to
a
river
and
they
floated
on
their
way
through
a

in

always
left

for

hunting
and
that
the
time
of

he
was
not

have

of

found

hid

from

might

ashore

how
to

made

that
it
might
be
construed
as
a
token
of
fear

little
knot
of
frenchmen
stood

in

passive
yet
prepared
for

the
indians
on
their
part
rallying
a
little
from
their
fright
made
all
haste
to
proffer
peace
two
of
their
chiefs
came
forward
holding
out
the
calumet
while
another
began
a
loud
harangue
to
check
the
young
warriors
who
were
aiming
their
arrows
from
the
farther
bank

responding
to
these
friendly
overtures

while

caught
several
scared
children
and
soothed
them
with
winning
blandishments
the
uproar
was
quelled
and
the
strangers
were
presently
seated
in
the
midst
of
the
camp
beset
by
a
throng
of
wild
and
swarthy
figures
sidenote

hospitality
food
was
placed
before

and
as
the
illinois
code
of
courtesy
enjoined
their
entertainers
conveyed
the
morsels
with
their
own
hands
to
the
lips
of
these
unenviable
victims
of
their
hospitality
while
others
rubbed
their
feet
with
bear
grease
la

on
his
part
made
them
a
gift
of
tobacco
and
hatchets
and
when
he
had
escaped
from
their
caresses
rose
and
harangued
them
he
told
them
that
he
had
been
forced
to
take
corn
from
their
granaries
lest
his
men
should
die
of
hunger
but
he
prayed
them
not
to
be
offended
promising
full
restitution
or
ample
payment
he
had
come
he
said
to
protect
them
against
their
enemies
and
teach
them
to
pray
to
the
true
god
as
for
the
iroquois
they
were
subjects
of
the
great
king
and
therefore
brethren
of
the
french
yet
nevertheless
should
they
begin
a
war
and
invade
the
country
of
the
illinois
he
would
stand
by
them
give
them
guns
and
fight
in
their
defence
if
they
would
permit
him
to
build
a
fort
among
them
for
the
security
of
his
men
it
was
also
he
added
his
purpose
to
build
a
great
wooden
canoe
in
which
to
descend
the
mississippi
to
the
sea
and
then
return
bringing
them
the
goods
of
which
they
stood
in
need
but
if
they
would
not
consent
to
his
plans
and
sell
provisions
to
his
men
he
would
pass
on
to
the
osages
who
would
then
reap
all
the
benefits
of
intercourse
with
the
french
while
they
were
left
destitute
at
the
mercy
of
the
iroquois
this
threat
had
its
effect
for
it

their
jealousy
of

osages

were
lavish
of

and
feasts
and
dances

soon
learned
that
the
intrigues

still
pursuing

evening

stranger
appeared
in

illinois

mascoutin

named
monso

by
five
or
six
miamis
and
bringing
a
gift
of
knives
hatchets
and
kettles
to
the
illinois
the
chiefs
assembled
in
a
secret
nocturnal
session
where
smoking
their
pipes
they
listened
with
open
ears
to
the
harangue
of
the
envoys
monso
told
them
that
he
had
come
in
behalf
of
certain
frenchmen
whom
he
named
to
warn
his
hearers
against
the
designs
of
la
salle
whom
he
denounced
as
a
partisan
and
spy
of
the
iroquois
affirming
that
he
was
now
on
his
way
to
stir
up
the
tribes
beyond
the
mississippi
to
join
in
a
war
against
the
illinois
who
thus
assailed
from
the
east
and
from
the
west
would
be
utterly
destroyed

was
no
hope
for
them

added

in
checking
the
farther
progress
of

or
at

retarding
it
thus
causing
his

to
desert

thrown
his
monso

had
won

in
it
a
device
of

this
belief
was
confirmed
when
in

afternoon

sent
to
invite
the
frenchmen
to

repaired

arose
and
began

long

he
told
the
frenchmen
that
he
had
invited
them
to
his
lodge
less
to
refresh
their
bodies
with
good
cheer
than
to
cure
their
minds

descending

after

around
on

read
an
augury

waited
patiently
however
till

with

he
thanked
him

a
name

as

was

corrupted
by

probably
its

in

the

was
given
to

why

it
is
not

to

an

in

the

one
day
near

met
a
young
illinois
on

way
home
from

questioned
him
with
apparent
carelessness
as
to
the
countries

had
visited
and
especially
as
to
the
mississippi
on
which
the
young
warrior
seeing
no
reason

disguise
the
truth
gave
him
all
the
information

required

made
him
the
present
of
a
hatchet
to
engage
him
to

nothing

and
leaving
him
in
excellent
humor
repaired
with
some
of
his
followers
to
the
illinois
camp
here
he
found
the
chiefs
seated
at
a
feast
of
meat
and
he
took
his
place
among
them
on
a
mat
of
rushes
after
a
pause

charged
them
with
having
deceived
him
in

adding
that
he
knew
the
river
perfectly
having
been
instructed
concerning
it
by
the
master
of

then
described
it
to

so
much
accuracy
that
his
astonished
hearers
conceiving
that
he
owed
his
knowledge
to
medicine
or
sorcery
clapped
their
hands
to
their
mouths
in
sign
of
wonder
and
confessed
that
all

warriors
from
the
mississippi
came
to
the

on
a
friendly

assured
the

not

that

one
chief
purpose
of
his

journey
was
to
procure
the
anchors

of
the

which
he
meant
to

work
went
on
with
such
vigor
that
within
six
weeks
the
hull
of
the
vessel
was
half
finished

was
of
forty
tons
burden
and
was
built
with

for
myself
what
had
become

bring
back
the
things
we
needed
the
winter
had
been
a
severe
one
and
when
an
hour
after
leaving
the
fort
he
and
his
companions
reached
the
still
water
of
peoria

they
found
it
sheeted
with
ice
from
shore
to

they
carried
their
canoes
up
the
bank
made
two
rude
sledges
placed
the
light
vessels
upon
them
and
dragged
them
to
the
upper
end
of
the
lake
where
they
encamped
in
the
morning
they
found
the
river
still
covered
with
ice
too
weak
to
bear
them
and
too
strong
to
permit
them
to
break
a
way
for
the
canoes
they
spent
the
whole
day
in
carrying
them
through
the
woods
toiling
in
saturated

fell
in

and
they
took
shelter
at
night
in
a
deserted
indian
hut
in
the
morning
the
third
of
march
they
dragged
their
canoes
half
a
league
farther
then
launched
them
and
breaking
the
ice
with
clubs
and
hatchets
forced
their
way
slowly
up
the
stream
again
their
progress
was
barred
and
again
they
took
to
the
woods
toiling
onward
till
a
tempest
of
moist
snow
forced
them
to
bivouac
for
the
night
a
sharp
frost
followed
and
in
the
morning
the
white
waste
around
them
was
glazed
with
a
dazzling
crust
now
for
the
first
time
they
could
use
their
bending
to
their
work
dragging
their
canoes
which
glided
smoothly
over
the
polished
surface
they
journeyed
on
hour
after
hour
and
league
after
league
till
they
reached
at
length
the
great
town

the
illinois

void
of
its
inhabitants

the
deserted

it
was
a
desolate
and
lonely

dark
and
cold

its
banks

the
empty
lodges
covered
with
crusted
snow
the
vast
white

the
distant
cliffs
bearded
with
shining
icicles
and
the
hills
wrapped
in
forests
which
glittered
from
afar
with
the
icy
incrustations
that
cased
each
frozen
twig
yet
there
was
life
in
the
savage
landscape
the
men
saw
buffalo
wading
in
the
snow
and
they
killed
one
of
them
more
than
this
they
discovered
the
tracks
of
moccasins
they
cut
rushes
by
the
edge
of
the
river
piled
them
on
the
bank
and
set
them
on
fire
that
the
smoke
might
attract
the
eyes
of
savages
roaming
near
on
the
following
day

the
hunters
were
smoking

gave

a

blanket
a
kettle
and
some
knives
and

made
friends
with

promised
to
restrain
the
iroquois
from
attacking
them
told
them
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
settlements
to
bring
arms
and
ammunition
to
defend
them
against
their
enemies
and
as
the
result
of
these
advances
gained
from
the
chief
a
promise
that
he
would
send
provisions
to
tonty
party
at
fort
crèvecoeur
after
several
days
spent
at
the
deserted
town
la

prepared
to
resume
his
journey
before
his
departure
his
attention
was
attracted
to
the
remarkable
cliff
of
yellow
sandstone
now
called
starved
rock
a
mile
or
more
above
the
village
a
natural
fortress
which
a
score
of
resolute
white
men
might
make
good
against
a
host
of
savages

he
soon
afterwards
sent
tonty
an
order
to
examine
it
and
make
it
his
stronghold
in
case
of
need
on
the
fifteenth
the
party
set
out
again
carried
their
canoes
along
the
bank
of
the
river
as
far
as
the
rapids
above
ottawa
then
launched
them
and
pushed
their
way
upward
battling
with
the
floating
ice
which
loosened
by
a
warm
rain
drove
down
the
swollen
current
in
sheets
on
the
eighteenth
they
reached
a
point
some
miles
below
the
site
of
joliet
and
here
found
the
river
once
more
completely
closed
despairing
of
farther
progress
by
water
they
hid
their
canoes
on
an
island
and
struck
across
the
country
for
lake

journey
it
was
the
worst
of
all
seasons
for
such
a
journey
the
nights
were
cold
but
the
sun
was
warm
at
noon
and
the
prairie
was
one
vast
tract
of
mud
water
and
discolored
snow
on
the
they
crossed
marshes
and
inundated
meadows
wading
to
the
knee
till
at
noon
they
were
stopped
by
a
river
perhaps
the
calumet
they
made
a
raft
of
timber
for
there
was
no
other
and
shoved
themselves
across
on
the
next
day
they
could
see
lake
michigan
dimly
glimmering
beyond
the
waste
of
woods
and
after
crossing
three
swollen
streams
they
reached
it
at
evening
on
the
they
followed
its
shore
till
at
nightfall
they
arrived
at
the
fort
which
they
had
built
in
the
autumn
at
the
mouth
of
the
joseph

reported
that
they
had
made
the
circuit
of
the
lake
and
had
neither
seen

nor
heard
tidings
of
her
assured
of
her
fate
he
ordered
them
to
rejoin
tonty
at

while
he
pushed
onward
with
his
party
through
the
unknown

of

michigan
the
rain

which
lasted
all
day
and
the
raft
we
were
obliged
to
make
to
cross
the
river
stopped
us
till
noon
of
the
when
we
continued
our
march
through
the
woods
which
was
so
interlaced
with
thorns
and
brambles
that
in
two
days
and
a
half
our
clothes
were
all
torn
and
our
faces
so
covered
with
blood
that
we
hardly
knew
each
other
on
the
we
found
the
woods
more
open
and
began
to
fare
better
meeting
a
good
deal
of
game
which
after
this
rarely
failed
us
so
that
we
no
longer
carried
provisions
with
us
but
made
a
meal
of
roast
meat
wherever
we
happened
to
kill
a
deer
bear
or
turkey
these
are
the
choicest
feasts
on
a
journey
like
this
and
till
now
we
had
generally
gone
without
them
so
that
we
had
often
walked
all
day
without
breakfast
sidenote
indian
alarms
the
indians
do
not
hunt
in
this
region
which
is
debatable
ground
between
five
or
six
nations
who
are
at
war
and
being
afraid
of
each
other
do
not
venture
into
these
parts
except
to
surprise
each
other
and
always
with
the
greatest
precaution
and
all
possible
secrecy
the
reports
of
our
guns
and
the
carcasses
of
the
animals
we
killed
soon
led
some
of
them
to
find
our
trail
in
fact
on
the
evening
of
the
having
made
our
fire
by
the
edge
of
a
prairie
we
were
surrounded
by
them
but
as
the
man
on
guard
waked
us
and
we
posted
ourselves
behind
trees
with
our
guns
these
savages
who
are
called
wapoos
took
us
for
iroquois
and
thinking
that
there
must
be
a
great
many
of
us
because
we
did
not
travel
secretly
as
they
do
when
in
small
bands
they
ran
off
without
shooting
their
arrows
and
gave
the
alarm
to
their
comrades
so
that
we
were
two
days
without
meeting
anybody
la
salle
guessed
the
cause
of
their
fright
and
in
order
to
confirm
their
delusion
he
drew
with
charcoal
on
the
trunks
of
trees
from
which
he
had
stripped
the
bark
the
usual
marks
of
an
iroquois
with
signs
for
prisoners
and
for
scalps
after
the
custom
of
those
dreaded
warriors
this
ingenious
artifice
as
will
soon
appear
was
near
proving
the
destruction
of
the
whole
party
he
also
set
fire
to
the
dry
grass
of
the
prairies
over
which
he
and
his
men
had
just
passed
thus
destroying
the
traces
of
their
passage
we
practised
this
device
every
night
and
it
answered
very
well
so
long
as
we
were
passing
over
an
open
country
but
on
the
thirtieth
we
got
into
great
marshes
flooded
by
the
thaws
and
were
obliged
to
cross
them
in
mud
or
water
up
to
the
waist
so
that
our
tracks
betrayed
us
to
a
band
of
mascoutins
who
were
out
after
iroquois
they
followed
us
through
these
marshes
during
the
three
days
we
were
crossing
them
but
we
made
no
fire
at
night
contenting
ourselves
with
taking
off
our
wet
clothes
and
wrapping
ourselves
in
our
blankets
on
some
dry
knoll
where
we
slept
till
morning
at
last
on
the
night
of
the
second
of
april
there
came
a
hard
frost
and
our
clothes
which
were
drenched
when
we
took
them
off
froze
stiff
as
sticks
so
that
we
could
not
put
them
on
in
the
morning
without
making
a
fire
to
thaw
them
the
fire
betrayed
us
to
the
indians
who
were
encamped
across
the
marsh
and
they
ran
towards
us
with
loud
cries
till
they
were
stopped
halfway
by
a
stream
so
deep
that
they
could
not
get
over
the
ice
which
had
formed
in
the
night
not
being
strong
enough
to
bear
them
we
went
to
meet
them
within
and
whether
our
frightened
them
or
whether
they
thought
us
more
numerous
than
we
were
or
whether
they
really
meant
us
no
harm
they
called
out
in
the
illinois
language
that
they
had
taken
us
for
iroquois
but
now
saw
that
we
were
friends
and
brothers
whereupon
they
went
off
as
they
came
and
we
kept
on
our
way
till
the
fourth
when
two
of
my
men
fell
ill
and
could
not
walk
in
this
emergency
la
salle
went
in
search
of
some
watercourse
by
which
they
might
reach
lake
erie
and
soon
came
upon
a
small
river
which
was
probably
the
huron
here
while
the
sick
men
rested
their
companions
made
a
canoe
there
were
no
and
they
were
forced
to
use
which
at
that
early
season
would
not
slip
freely
from
the
wood
until
they
loosened
it
with
hot
water
their
canoe
being
made
they
embarked
in
it
and
for
a
time
floated
prosperously
down
the
stream
when
at
length
the
way
was
barred
by
a
matted
barricade
of
trees
fallen
across
the
water
the
sick
men
could
now
walk
again
and
pushing
eastward
through

forest

to

thence
descended

coasted
the

and
at

reached

was

had

difficulty
in
inducing
the
indians
who
had
been
excited
against
him
to
sell
him
provisions
anxious
to
reach
his
destination
he
pushed
forward
with
twelve
men
leaving

to
bring
on
the
rest
on
the
fourth
of
november
he
reached
the
ruined

at
the
mouth
of

and
left
five
of
his
party
with
the
heavy
stores
to
wait
till
la

should
come
up
while
he
himself
hastened
forward
with
six
frenchmen
and

a
deep
anxiety
possessed
him
the
rumor
current
for
months
past
that
the
iroquois
bent
on
destroying
the
illinois
were
on
the
point
of
invading
their
country
had
constantly
gained

here
was
a
new
disaster
which
if
realized
might
involve
him
and
his
enterprise
in
irretrievable
wreck
he
ascended
the

crossed
the
portage
to
the
kankakee
and
followed
its
course
downward
till
it
joined
the
northern
branch
of

he
had
heard
nothing
of
tonty
on
the
way
and
neither
here
nor
elsewhere
could
he
discover
the
smallest
sign
of
the
passage
of
white
men
his
friend
therefore
if
alive
was
probably
still
at
his
post
and
he
pursued
his
course
with
a
mind
lightened
in

small

he
had

all
was

but
now
the
scene
was
changed
the
boundless

was
thronged
with
life
he
beheld
that
wondrous
spectacle
still
to
be
seen
at
times
on
the
plains
of
the
remotest
west
and
the
memory
of
which
can
quicken

stir
the

after
the
lapse

like

dotting

trampling

in
ponderous
columns

in

and

at

wading
plunging
and
snorting
in

water
climbing
the
muddy
shores
and
staring
with
wild
eyes
at
the
passing
canoes
it
was
an
opportunity
not
to
be
lost
the
party
landed
and
encamped
for
a
hunt
sometimes
they
hid
under
the
shelving
bank
and
shot
them
as
they
came
to
drink
sometimes
flat
on
their
faces
they
dragged
themselves
through
the
long
dead
grass
till
the
savage
bulls
guardians
of
the
herd
ceased
their
grazing
raised
their
huge
heads
and
glared
through
tangled
hair
at
the
dangerous
intruders
the
hunt
was
successful
in
three
days
the
hunters
killed
twelve
buffalo
besides
deer

and
swans
they
cut
the
meat
into
thin
flakes
and
dried
it
in
the
sun
or
in
the
smoke
of
their
fires
the
men
were
in
high
spirits
delighting
in
the
sport
and
rejoicing
in
the
prospect
of
relieving
tonty
and
his
hungry
followers
with
a
plentiful
supply
they
embarked
again
and
soon
approached
the
great
town
of
the
illinois
the
buffalo
were
far
behind
and
once
more
the
canoes
glided
on
their
way
through
a
voiceless
solitude
no
hunters
were
seen
no
saluting
whoop
greeted
their
ears
they
passed
the
cliff
afterwards
called
the
rock
of
louis
where
la
salle
had
ordered
tonty
to
build
his
stronghold
but
as
he
scanned
its
lofty
top
he
saw
no
palisades
no
cabins
no
sign
of
human
hand
and
still
its
primeval
crest
of
forests
overhung
the
gliding
river
now
the
meadow
opened
before
them
where
the
great
town
had
stood
they
gazed
astonished
and
confounded
all
was
desolation
the
town
had
vanished
and
the
meadow
was
black
with
fire
they
plied
their
paddles
hastened
to
the
spot
landed
and
as
they
looked
around
their
cheeks
grew
white
and
the
blood
was
frozen
in
their
veins
sidenote
a
night
of
horror
before
them
lay
a
plain
once
swarming
with
wild
human
life
and
covered
with
indian
dwellings
now
a
waste
of
devastation
and
death
strewn
with
heaps
of
ashes
and
bristling
with
the
charred
poles
and
stakes
which
had
formed
the
framework
of
the
lodges
at
the
points
of
most
of
them

entered
its
revolting
precincts

in
multitudes
fled
at
their
approach
while
clouds
of
crows
or
buzzards
rising
from
the
hideous
repast
wheeled
above
their
heads
or
settled
on
the
naked
branches
of
the
neighboring

every
grave
had
been
rifled
and
the
bodies
flung
down
from
the
scaffolds
where
after
the
illinois
custom
many
of
them
had
been
placed
the
field
was
strewn
with
broken
bones
and
torn
and

a

had
been
waged

the
handiwork
of
the

the
threatened
blow
had
fallen
and
the
wolfish
hordes
of
the
five
cantons
had
fleshed
their
rabid
fangs
in
a
new
victim
not
far
distant
the
conquerors
had
made
a
rude
fort
of
trunks
boughs
and
roots
of
trees
laid
together
to
form
a
circular
enclosure
and
this
too
was
garnished
with
skulls
stuck
on
the
broken
branches
and
protruding
sticks
the
or
subterranean
of
the

had
been
broken

and
the

scattered
the

were
laid
waste
and
much
of
the
corn
thrown
into
heaps
and
half
burned
as
la

surveyed
this
scene
of
havoc
one
thought
engrossed
him
where
were
tonty
and
his
men
he
searched
the
iroquois
fort
there
were
abundant
traces
of
its
savage
occupants
and
among
them
a
few
fragments
of
french
clothing
he
examined
the
skulls
but
the
hair
portions
of
which
clung
to
nearly
all
of
them
was
in
every
case
that
of
an
indian
evening
came
on
before
he
had
finished
the
search
the
sun
set
and
the
wilderness
sank
to
its
savage
rest
night
and
silence
brooded
over
the
waste
where
far
as
the
raven
could
wing
his
flight
stretched
the
dark
domain
of
solitude
and
horror
yet
there
was
no
silence
at
the
spot
where
la
salle
and
his
companions
made
their
bivouac
the
howling
of
the
wolves
filled
the
air
with
fierce
and
dreary
dissonance
more
dangerous
foes
were
not
far
off
for
before
nightfall
they
had
seen
fresh
indian
tracks
but
as
it
was
very
cold
says
la

this
did
not
prevent

from
making
a
fire
and
lying
down
by
it

keeping

i
spent
the

in
a
distress
which
you
can

the
position
of
those
i
was
looking
after
and
my
uncertainty
as
to
what
would
become
of
the
men
who
were
to
follow
me
with
la
forest
if
they
arrived
at
the
ruined
village
and
did
not
find
me
there
made
me
apprehend
every
sort
of
trouble
and
disaster
at
last
i
decided
to
keep
on
my
way
down
the
river
leaving
some
of
my
men
behind
in
charge
of
the
goods
which
it
was
not
only
useless
but
dangerous
to
carry
with
me
because
we
should
be
forced
to
abandon
them
when
the
winter
fairly
set
in
which
would
be
very
soon
sidenote
fears
for
tonty
this
resolution
was
due
to
a
discovery
he
had
made
the
evening
before
which
offered
as
he
thought
a
possible
clew
to
the
fate
of
tonty
and
the
men
with
him
he
thus
describes
it
near
the
garden
of
the
indians
which
was
on
the
meadows
a
league
from
the
village
and
not
far
from
the
river
i
found
six
pointed
stakes
set
in
the
ground
and
painted
red
on
each
of
them
was
the
figure
of
a
man
with
bandaged
eyes
drawn
in
black
as
the
savages
often
set
stakes
of
this
sort
where
they
have
killed
people
i
thought
by
their
number
and
position
that
when
the
iroquois
came
the
illinois
finding
our
men
alone
in
the
hut
near
their
garden
had
either
killed
them
or
made
them
prisoners
and
i
was
confirmed
in
this
because
seeing
no
signs
of
a
battle
i
supposed
that
on
hearing
of
the
approach
of
the
iroquois
the
old
men
and
other
had
fled
and
that
the
young
warriors
had
remained
behind
to
cover
their
flight
and
afterwards
followed
taking
the
french
with
them
while
the
iroquois
finding
nobody
to
kill
had
vented
their
fury
on
the
corpses
in
the
graveyard
uncertain
as
was
the
basis
of
this
conjecture
and
feeble
as
was
the
hope
it
afforded
it
determined
him
to
push
forward
in
order
to
learn
more
when
daylight
returned
he
told
his
purpose
to
his
followers
and
directed
three
of
them
to
await
his
return
near
the
ruined
village
they
were
to
hide
themselves
on
an
island
conceal
their
fire
at
night
make
no
smoke
by
day
fire
no
guns
and
keep
a
close
watch
should
the
rest
of
the
party
arrive
they
too
were
to
wait
with
similar
precautions
the
baggage
was
placed
in
a
hollow
of
the
rocks
at
a
place
difficult
of
access
and
these
arrangements
made
la

set
out
on
his
perilous
journey
with
the
four
remaining

and

each
was
armed
with
two
guns
a
pistol
and
a
sword
and
a
number
of
hatchets
and
other
goods
were
placed
in
the
canoe
as
presents
for
indians
whom
they
might
meet
several
leagues
below
the
village
they
found
on
their
right
hand
close
to
the
river
a
sort
of
island
made
inaccessible
by
the
marshes
and
water
which
surrounded
it
here
the
flying
illinois
had
sought
refuge
with
their
women
and
children
and
the
place
was
full
of
their
deserted
huts
on
the
left
bank
exactly
opposite
was
an
abandoned
camp
of
the
iroquois
on
the
level

stood
a
hundred
and
thirteen
huts
and
on
the
forest

which
covered
the
hills
behind
were
carved
the
totems

insignia
of
the
chiefs
together
with
marks
to
show
the
number
of
followers
which
each
had
led
to

five
hundred

he
found
marks
too
for
the

killed
or
captured
but
none
to
indicate
that
any
of
the
frenchmen
had

their

was
a

the

the
silence
of
death
now
reigned
along
the
deserted
river
whose
lonely
borders
wrapped
deep
in
forests
seemed
lifeless
as
the
grave
as
they
drew
near
the
mouth
of
the
stream
they
saw
a
meadow
on
their
right
and
on
its
farthest
verge
several
human
figures
erect
yet
motionless
they
landed
and
cautiously
examined
the
place
the
long
grass
was
trampled
down
and
all
around
were
strewn
the
relics
of
the
hideous
orgies
which
formed
the
ordinary
sequel
of
an
iroquois
victory
the
figures
they
had
seen
were
the
bodies
of

still
bound
to
the
stakes
where
they
had
been
tortured
other
sights
there
were
too
revolting
for

were

long
and
anxiously
without
finding
the

that
could

descending

they
soon
reached
its
mouth
before
them
a
broad
eddying
current
rolled
swiftly
on
its
way
and
la

beheld
the
mississippi
the
object
of
his
the
destined
avenue
of
his
ambition
and
his
hopes
it
was
no
time
for
reflections
the
moment
was
too
engrossing
too
heavily
charged
with
anxieties
and
cares
from
a
rock
on
the
shore
he
saw
a
tree
stretched
forward
above
the
stream
and
stripping
off
its
bark
to
make
it
more
conspicuous
he
hung
upon
it
a
board
on
which
he
had
drawn
the
figures
of
himself
and
his
men
seated
in
their
canoe
and
bearing
a
pipe
of
peace
to
this
he
tied
a
letter
for
tonty
informing
him
that
he
had
returned
up
the
river
to
the
ruined
village
his
four
men
had
behaved
admirably
throughout
and
they
now
offered
to
continue
the
journey
if
he
saw
fit
and
follow
him
to
the
sea
but
he
thought
it
useless
to
go
farther
and
was
unwilling
to
abandon
the
three
men
whom
he
had
ordered
to
await
his
return
accordingly
they
retraced
their
course
and
paddling
at
times
both
day
and
night
urged
their
canoe
so
swiftly
that
they
reached
the
village

the
incredibly
short
space
of
four
days
sidenote
the
comet
the
sky
was
clear
and
as
night
came
on
the
travellers
saw
a
prodigious
comet
blazing
above
this
scene
of
desolation
on
that
night
it
was
chilling
with
a
superstitious
awe
the
hamlets
of
new
england
and
the
gilded
chambers
of
versailles
but
it
is
characteristic
of
la
salle
that
beset
as
he
was
with
perils
and
surrounded
with
ghastly
images
of
death
he
coolly
notes
down
the
phenomenon
not
as
a
portentous
messenger
of
war
and
woe
but
rather
as
an
object
of
scientific
curiosity
he
found
his
three
men
safely
ensconced
upon
their
island
where
they
were
anxiously
looking
for
his
return
after
collecting
a
store
of
corn
from
the
ravaged
granaries
of
the
illinois
the
whole
party
began
to
ascend
the
river
and
on
the
sixth
of
january
reached
the
junction
of
the
kankakee
with
the
northern
branch
on
their
way
downward
they
had
descended
the
former
stream
they
now
chose
the
latter
and
soon
discovered
by
the
margin
of
the
water
a
rude
cabin
of
bark
la
salle
landed
and
examined
the
spot
when
an
object
met
his
eye
which
cheered
him
with
a
bright
gleam
of
hope
it
was
but
a
piece
of
wood
but
the
wood
had
been
cut
with
a
saw
tonty
and
his
party
then
had
passed
this
way
escaping
from
the
carnage
behind
them
unhappily
they
had
left
no
token
of
their
passage
at
the
fork
of
the
two
streams
and
thus
la
salle
on
his
voyage
downward
had
believed
them
to
be
still
on
the
river
below
with
rekindled
hope
the
travellers
pursued
their
journey
leaving
their
canoes
and
making
their
way
overland

extraordinary
quantities
all

with

so
severe
that
i
never
knew
so
hard
a
winter
even
in

we
were
obliged
to
cross
forty
leagues
of
open
country
where
we
could
hardly
find
wood
to
warm
ourselves
at
evening
and
could
get
no
bark
whatever
to
make
a

so
that
we
had
to
spend
the
night
exposed
to
the
furious
winds

blow
over
these

i
never

much

with

too
was
for
the
most

a

impenetrable
and
cold

rarely
answered

he
could
always
however
inspire
respect
if
not

now
the
restraint
of
his

was
removed
he
had
not
been
long
absent
when
a
was
thrown
into
the
midst
of
the
discontented
and
restless
crew
it
may
be

that

had
met
two
of

at
his

on

ordered

to
rejoin

told

was
lost

was
seized
by
the
creditors
of

that

that

the

would
never
receive
their

their
wages
were
in

for
more
than
two
years
and
indeed
it
would
have
been
folly
to
pay
them
before
their
return
to
the

as
to
do
so
would
have
been
a
temptation
to
desert
now
however
the
effect
on

was
still

of

did
that
they
would

by

different
routes
to
inform

besides

just
named

now
remained
with

only
one

was
left
among

as
a

resolved
apparently
to
disarm
their
jealousy
by
a
show
of
confidence

took
up

the

had
made
the

desolation

now
tired
of

they
were
seeking
to
borrow
their
own
savage
metaphor

nations
to
devour
yet
it
was
not
alone
their
homicidal
fury
that
now
impelled
them
to
another

strange
as
it
may
seem
this
war
was
in
no
small
measure
one
of
commercial
advantage
they
had
long
traded
with
the
dutch
and
english
of
new
york
who
gave
them
in
exchange
for
their
furs
the
guns
ammunition
knives
hatchets
kettles
beads
and
brandy
which
had
become
indispensable
to
them

was
scarce
in
their
country
they
must
seek
their
beaver
and
other
skins
in
the
vacant
territories
of
the
tribes
they
had
destroyed
but
this
did
not
content
them
the

were
seeking
to
secure

of

furs
of
the
north
and
west
and
of

the
enterprises
of
la
salle
on
the
tributaries
of
the
mississippi
had
especially
roused
the
jealousy
of
the
iroquois
fomented
moreover
by
dutch
and
english
traders
these
crafty
savages
would
fain
reduce
all
these
regions
to
subjection
and
draw
thence
an
exhaustless
supply
of
furs
to
be
bartered
for
english
goods

well
as

most
accessible

among

were
some
in
whom
jealousy
of
a
hated
rival
could
so
far
override
all
the
best
interests
of
the
colony
that
they
did
not
scruple
to
urge
on
the

an
invasion

they

would

these

machiavels
had
intrigued
so
well
among
the
miamis
working
craftily
on
their
jealousy
that
they
induced
them
to
join
in
the

there

or
something
like
it
one
may
safely
affirm
was
the
aspect
of
the
illinois
village
at
noon
of
the

of

were
not
in
the
village
but
at
a
hut
a
league
distant
whither
they
had
gone
to
make
a
retreat
for
prayer
and
meditation
their
missionary
labors
had
not
been
fruitful
they
had
made
no
converts
and
were
in
despair
at
the
intractable
character
of
the
objects
of
their
zeal
as
for
the
other
frenchmen

doubtless
hung
heavy
on
their

monotony

nor

nor

nor

nor
gambling

beguile
the
lagging
hours
sidenote
the
alarm
suddenly
the
village
was
wakened
from
its
lethargy
as
by
the
crash
of
a
thunderbolt
a
shawanoe
lately
here
on
a
visit
had
left
his
illinois
friends
to
return
home
he
now
reappeared
crossing
the
river
in
hot
haste
with
the
announcement
that
he
had
met
on
his
way
an
army
of
iroquois
approaching
to
attack
them
all
was
panic
and
confusion
the

disgorged

frightened
inmates
women
and

startled
warriors
snatched
their
weapons
there
were
less
than
five
hundred

them
for
the
greater

of
the
young
men
had
gone
to

crowd
of
excited
savages
thronged
about
tonty
and
his
frenchmen
already

of
their
suspicion

them
with
furious
gesticulation
with
having
stirred
up
their
enemies
to
invade
them
tonty
defended
himself
in
broken
illinois
but
the
naked
mob
were
but
half
convinced
they
seized
the
forge
and
tools
and
flung
them
into
the
river
with
all
the
goods
that
had
been
saved
from
the
deserters
then
distrusting
their
power
to
defend
themselves
they
manned
the
wooden
canoes
which
lay
in
multitudes
by
the
bank
embarked
their
women
and
children
and
paddled
down
the
stream
to
that
island
of
dry
land
in
the
midst
of
marshes

la

afterwards
found
filled
with
their
deserted
huts

warriors

here
to

them

excited
warriors

their
bodies

their
heads

their
hatchets

up
their
courage

crisis
the
morning
came
and
with
it
came
the
iroquois
young
warriors
had
gone
out
as
scouts
and
now
they
returned
they
had
seen
the
enemy
in
the
line
of
forest
that
bordered
the
river
aramoni
or
vermilion
and
had
stealthily
reconnoitred
them
they
were
very
numerous
and
armed
for
the
most
part
with
guns
pistols
and
swords
some
had
bucklers
of
wood
or
and
some
wore
those
corselets
of
tough
twigs
interwoven
with
cordage
which
their
fathers
had
used
when
were
unknown
the
scouts
added
more
for
they
declared
that
they
had
seen
a
jesuit
among
the
iroquois
nay
that
la

himself
was
there
whence
it
must
follow
that
tonty
and
his
men
were
enemies
and
traitors
the
supposed
jesuit
was
but
an
iroquois
chief
arrayed
in
a
black
hat
doublet
and
stockings
while
another
equipped
after
a
somewhat
similar
fashion
passed
in
the

were

hung
by

him
mad
with
rage
and
terror
he
had
come
lately
from
europe
and
knew
little
of
indians
but
as
the
friar
membré
says
of
him
he
was
full
of
intelligence
and
courage
and
when
they
heard
him
declare
that
he
and
his
frenchmen
would
go
with
them
to
fight
the
iroquois
their
threats
grew
less
clamorous
and
their
eyes
glittered
with
a
less
deadly
lustre

and

from

iroquois
were

professed
to
be
at

with
the

and
taking
counsel
of
his
courage
he
resolved
on
an
attempt
to
mediate
which
may
well
be
called
a
desperate
one
he
laid
aside
his
gun
took
in
his
hand
a
wampum
belt
as
a
flag
of
truce
and
walked
forward
to
meet
the
savage
multitude
attended
by

frenchman
and
a
young
illinois
who
had
the
hardihood
to
accompany
him
the
guns
of
the
iroquois
still
flashed
thick
and
fast
some
of

were
aimed
at

alone

out
the
wampum
belt

dodge

shot

small
keen
eyes

shone
like
an
angry
snake

at

a
chief
called
out

were
not
pierced

of

tried
to
stop
the

and
led
him
to
the

where
an
angry
parley
ensued

still
resounded
in
the

tonty
breathless
and
bleeding
at
the

thereupon
thinking
he
was

renewed
the

and
the
firing
in

clattered
more
angrily
than
before
a
warrior
ran
in
crying
out
that
the

were
giving

that
there
were

lifting
my

carried
his
point

having
failed
to

their
enemies
as
they
had
hoped
now
saw
an
opportunity
to
delude
them
by
a
truce
they
sent
back
tonty
with
a
belt
of
peace
he
held
it
aloft
in

warriors
ran
to

like

waked
from

nightmare
dizzy
almost
fainting
with

staggered
across

in

a

from

had
but
lately
heard
of
what
was
passing
and
who
now
with
benedictions
and
thanksgiving
ran
to
embrace
him
as

man
escaped
from
the
jaws
of

now
withdrew
in

canoes

crossing
again
to

scarcely
had
they
reached
them
when
their
enemies
appeared
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
on
the
opposite
bank
many
found
means
to
cross
and
under
the
pretext
of
seeking
for
provisions
began
to
hover
in

about
the
skirts

to
remain

ensconced
themselves

havoc
at
their
leisure

and
his

occupied

who
had
felt
their
courage
and
who
had
been
told
by
tonty
that
they
were
twice
as
numerous
as
themselves
showed
symptoms
of
no
little
uneasiness
they
proposed
that
he
should
act
as
mediator
to
which
he
gladly
assented
and
crossed
the
meadow
towards
the
illinois
accompanied
by
membré
and
by
an
iroquois
who
was
sent
as
a
hostage
the
illinois
hailed
the
overtures
with
delight
gave
the
ambassadors
some
refreshment
which
they
sorely
needed
and
sent
back
with
them
a
young
man
of
their
nation
as
a
hostage
on
their
part
this
indiscreet
youth
nearly
proved
the
ruin
of
the
negotiation
for
he
was
no
sooner
among
the
iroquois
than
he
showed
such
an
eagerness
to
close
the
treaty
made
such
promises
professed
such
gratitude
and
betrayed
so
rashly
the
numerical
weakness
of
the
illinois
that
he
revived
all
the
insolence
of
the
invaders
they
turned
furiously
upon
tonty
and
charged
him
with
having
robbed
them
of
the
glory
and
the
spoils
of
victory
where
are
all
your
illinois
warriors
and
where
are
the
sixty
frenchmen
that
you
said
were
among
them
it
needed
all
tonty
tact
and
coolness
to
extricate
himself
from
this
new
danger
sidenote
iroquois
treachery
the
treaty
was
at
length
concluded
but
scarcely
was
it
made
when
the
iroquois
prepared
to
break
it
and
set
about
constructing
canoes
of
in
which
to
attack
the
illinois
women
and
children
in
their
island
sanctuary
tonty
warned
his
allies
that
the
pretended
peace
was
but
a
snare
for
their
destruction
the
iroquois
on
their
part
grew
hourly
more
jealous
of
him
and
would
certainly
have
killed
him
had
it
not
been
their
policy
to
keep
the
peace
with
frontenac
and
the
french
several
days
after
they
summoned
him
and
membré
to
a
council
six
packs
of
were
brought
in
and
the
savage
orator
presented
them
to
tonty
in
turn
explaining
their
meaning
as
he
did
so
the
first
two
were
to
declare
that
the
children
of
count
frontenac
that
is
the
illinois
should
not
be
eaten
the
next
was
a
plaster
to
heal
wound
the
next
was
oil
wherewith
to
anoint
him
and
membré
that
they
might
not
be
fatigued
in
travelling
the
next
proclaimed
that
the
sun
was
bright
and
the
sixth
and
last
required
them
to
decamp
and
go
home
tonty
thanked
them
for
their
gifts
but
demanded
when
they
themselves
meant
to
go
and
leave
the
illinois
in
peace
at
this
the
conclave
grew
angry
and
despite
their
late
pledge
some
of
them
said
that
before
they
went
they
would
eat
illinois
flesh
tonty
instantly
kicked
away
the
packs
of
the
indian
symbol
of
the
scornful
rejection
of
a
proposal
telling
them
that
since
they
meant
to
eat
the
governor
children
he
would
have
none
of
their
presents
the
chiefs
in
a
rage
rose
and
drove
him
from
the
lodge
the
french
withdrew
to
their
hut
where
they
stood
all
night
on
the
watch
expecting
an
attack
and
resolved
to
sell
their
lives
dearly
at
daybreak
the
chiefs
ordered
them
to
begone
sidenote
murder
of
ribourde
tonty
with
admirable
fidelity
and
courage
had
done
all
in
the
power
of
man
to
protect
the
allies
of
canada
against
their
ferocious
assailants
and
he
thought
it
unwise
to
persist
further
in
a
course
which
could
lead
to
no
good
and
which
would
probably
end
in
the
destruction
of
the
whole
party
he
embarked
in
a
leaky
canoe
with
membré
ribourde
boisrondet
and
the
remaining
two
men
and
began
to
ascend
the
river
after
paddling
about
five
leagues
they
landed
to
dry
their
baggage
and
repair
their
crazy
vessel
when
father
ribourde
breviary
in
hand
strolled
across
the
sunny
meadows
for
an
hour
of
meditation
among
the
neighboring
groves
evening
approached
and
he
did
not
return
tonty
with
one
of
the
men
went
to
look
for
him
and
following
his
tracks
presently
discovered
those
of
a
band
of
indians
who
had
apparently
seized
or
murdered
him
still
they
did
not
despair
they
fired
their
guns
to
guide
him
should
he
still
be
alive
built
a
huge
fire
by
the
bank
and
then
crossing
the
river
lay
watching
it
from
the
other
side
at
midnight
they
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
hovering
around
the
blaze
then
many
more
appeared
but
ribourde
was
not
among
them
in
truth
a
band
of
kickapoos
enemies
of
the
iroquois
about
whose
camp
they
had
been
prowling
in
quest
of
scalps
had
met
and
wantonly
murdered
the
inoffensive
old
man
they
carried
his
scalp
to
their
village
and
danced
round
it
in
triumph
pretending
to
have
taken
it
from
an
enemy
thus
in
his
year
the
only
heir
of
a
wealthy
burgundian
house
perished
under
the
of
the
savages
for
whose
salvation
he
had
renounced
station
ease
and
affluence
sidenote
attack
of
the
iroquois
meanwhile
a
hideous
scene
was
enacted
at
the
ruined
village
of
the
illinois
their
savage
foes
balked
of
a
living
prey
wreaked
their
fury
on
the
dead
they
dug
up
the
graves
they
threw
down
the
scaffolds
some
of
the
bodies
they
burned
some
they
threw
to
the
dogs
some
it
is
affirmed
they
ate
placing
the
skulls
on
stakes
as
trophies
they
turned
to
pursue
the
illinois
who
when
the
french
withdrew
had
abandoned
their
asylum
and
retreated
down
the
river
the
iroquois
still
it
seems
in
awe
of
them
followed
them
along
the
opposite
bank
each
night
encamping
face
to
face
with
them
and
thus
the
adverse
bands
moved
slowly
southward
till
they
were
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
hitherto
the
compact
array
of
the
illinois
had
held
their
enemies
in
check
but
now
suffering
from
hunger
and
lulled
into
security
by
the
assurances
of
the
iroquois
that
their
object
was
not
to
destroy
them
but
only
to
drive
them
from
the
country
they
rashly
separated
into
their
several
tribes
some
descended
the
mississippi
some
more
prudent
crossed
to
the
western
side
one
of
their
principal
tribes
the
tamaroas
more
credulous
than
the
rest
had
the
fatuity
to
remain
near
the
mouth
of
the
illinois
where
they
were
speedily
assailed
by
all
the
force
of
the
iroquois
the
men
fled
and
very
few
of
them
were
killed
but
the
women
and
children
were
captured
to
the
number
it
is
said
of
seven
hundred
then
followed
that
scene
of
torture
of
which
some
two
weeks
later
la
salle
saw
the
revolting
traces
sated
at
length
with
horrors
the
conquerors
withdrew
leading
with
them
a
host
of
captives
and
exulting
in
their
triumphs
over
women
children
and
the
dead
after
the
death
of
father
ribourde
tonty
and
his
companions
remained
searching
for
him
till
noon
of
the
next
day
and
then
in
despair
of
again
seeing
him
resumed
their
journey
they
ascended
the
river
leaving
no
token
of
their
passage
at
the
junction
of
its
northern
and
southern
branches
for
food
they
gathered
acorns
and
dug
roots
in
the
meadows
their
canoe
proved
utterly
worthless
and
feeble
as
they
were
they
set
out
on
foot
for
lake
michigan
boisrondet
wandered
off
and
was
lost
he
had
dropped
the
flint
of
his
gun
and
he
had
no
bullets
but
he
cut
a
pewter
porringer
into
slugs
with
which
he
shot
wild
turkeys
by
discharging
his
piece
with
a
and
after
several
days
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
rejoin
the
party
their
object
was
to
reach
the
pottawattamies
of
green
bay
had
they
aimed
at
michilimackinac
they
would
have
found
an
asylum
with
la
forest
at
the
fort
on
the
joseph
but
unhappily
they
passed
westward
of
that
post
and
by
way
of
chicago
followed
the
borders
of
lake
michigan
northward
the
cold
was
intense
and
it
was
no
easy
task
to
grub
up
wild
onions
from
the
frozen
ground
to
save
themselves
from
starving
tonty
fell
ill
of
a
fever
and
a
swelling
of
the
limbs
which
disabled
him
from
travelling
and
hence
ensued
a
long
delay
at
length
they
neared
green
bay
where
they
would
have
starved
had
they
not
gleaned
a
few
ears
of
corn
and
frozen
squashes
in
the
fields
of
an
empty
indian
town
sidenote
friends
in
need
this
enabled
them
to
reach
the
bay
and
having
patched
an
old
canoe
which
they
had
the
good
luck
to
find
they
embarked
in
it
whereupon
says
tonty
there
rose
a
northwest
wind
which
lasted
five
days
with
driving
snow
we
consumed
all
our
food
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
next
we
resolved
to
go
back
to
the
deserted
town
and
die
by
a
warm
fire
in
one
of
the
wigwams
on
our
way
we
saw
a
smoke
but
our
joy
was
short
for
when
we
reached
the
fire
we
found
nobody
there
we
spent
the
night
by
it
and
before
morning
the
bay
froze
we
tried
to
break
a
way
for
our
canoe
through
the
ice
but
could
not
and
therefore
we
determined
to
stay
there
another
night
and
make
moccasins
in
order
to
reach
the
town
we
made
some
out
of
father
gabriel
cloak
i
was
angry
with
étienne
renault
for
not
finishing
his
but
he
excused
himself
on
account
of
illness
because
he
had
a
great
oppression
of
the
stomach
caused
by
eating
a
piece
of
an
indian
shield
of
which
he
could
not
digest
his
delay
proved
our
salvation
for
the
next
day
december
fourth
as
i
was
urging
him
to
finish
the
moccasins
and
he
was
still
excusing
himself
on
the
score
of
his
malady
a
party
of
kiskakon
ottawas
who
were
on
their
way
to
the
pottawattamies
saw
the
smoke
of
our
fire
and
came
to
us
we
gave
them
such
a
welcome
as
was
never
seen
before
they
took
us
into
their
canoes
and
carried
us
to
an
indian
village
only
two
leagues
off
there
we
found
five
frenchmen
who
received
us
kindly
and
all
the
indians
seemed
to
take
pleasure
in
sending
us
food
so
that
after
days
of
starvation
we
found
our
famine
turned
to
abundance
this
hospitable
village
belonged
to
the
pottawattamies
and
was
under
the
sway
of
the
chief
who
had
befriended
la
salle
the
year
before
and
who
was
wont
to
say
that
he
knew
but
three
great
captains
in
the
world
frontenac
la
salle
and
himself
the
illinois
town
the
site
of
the
great
illinois
this
has
not
till
now
been
determined
though
there
have
been
various
conjectures
concerning
it
from
a
study
of
the
contemporary
documents
and
maps
i
became
satisfied
first
that
the
branch
of
the
river
illinois
called
the
big
vermilion
was
the
of
the
french
explorers
and
secondly
that
the
cliff
called
starved
rock
was
that
known
to
the
french
as
or
the
rock
of
louis
if
i
was
right
in
this
conclusion
then
the
position
of
the
great
village
was
established
for
there
is
abundant
proof
that
it
was
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
above
the
aramoni
and
below
le
rocher
i
accordingly
went
to
the
village
of
utica
which
as
i
judged
by
the
map
was
very
near
the
point
in
question
and
mounted
to
the
top
of
one
of
the
hills
immediately
behind
it
whence
i
could
see
the
valley
of
the
illinois
for
miles
bounded
on
the
farther
side
by
a
range
of
hills
in
some
parts
rocky
and
precipitous
and
in
others
covered
with
forests
far
on
the
right
was
a
gap
in
these
hills
through
which
the
big
vermilion
flowed
to
join
the
illinois
and
somewhat
towards
the
left
at
the
distance
of
a
mile
and
a
half
was
a
huge
cliff
rising
perpendicularly
from
the
opposite
margin
of
the
river
this
i
assumed
to
be
of
the
french
though
from
where
i
stood
i
was
unable
to
discern
the
distinctive
features
which
i
was
prepared
to
find
in
it
in
every
other
respect
the
scene
before
me
was
precisely
what
i
had
expected
to
see
there
was
a
meadow
on
the
hither
side
of
the
river
on
which
stood
a
farmhouse
and
this
as
it
seemed
to
me
by
its
relations
with
surrounding
objects
might
be
supposed
to
stand
in
the
midst
of
the
space
once
occupied
by
the
illinois
town
on
the
way
down
from
the
hill
i
met
james
clark
the
principal
inhabitant
of
utica
and
one
of
the
earliest
settlers
of
this
region
i
accosted
him
told
him
my
objects
and
requested
a
half
conversation
with
him
at
his
leisure
he
seemed
interested
in
the
inquiry
and
said
he
would
visit
me
early
in
the
evening
at
the
inn
where
accordingly
he
soon
appeared
the
conversation
took
place
in
the
porch
where
a
number
of
farmers
and
others
were
gathered
i
asked
clark
if
any
indian
remains
were
found
in
the
neighborhood
yes
he
replied
plenty
of
them
i
then
inquired
if
there
was
any
one
spot
where
they
were
more
numerous
than
elsewhere
yes
he
answered
again
pointing
towards
the
farmhouse
on
the
meadow
on
my
farm
down
yonder
by
the
river
my
tenant
ploughs
up
teeth
and
bones
by
the
peck
every
spring
besides
beads
stone
hatchets
and
other
things
of
that
sort
i
replied
that
this
was
precisely
what
i
had
expected
as
i
had
been
led
to
believe
that
the
principal
town
of
the
illinois
indians
once
covered
that
very
spot
if
i
added
i
am
right
in
this
belief
the
great
rock
beyond
the
river
is
the
one
which
the
first
explorers
occupied
as
a
fort
and
i
can
describe
it
to
you
from
their
accounts
of
it
though
i
have
never
seen
it
except
from
the
top
of
the
hill
where
the
trees
on
and
around
it
prevented
me
from
seeing
any
part
but
the
front
the
men
present
now
gathered
around
to
listen
the
rock
i
continued
is
nearly
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
high
and
rises
directly
from
the
water
the
front
and
two
sides
are
perpendicular
and
inaccessible
but
there
is
one
place
where
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
climb
up
though
with
difficulty
the
top
is
large
enough
and
level
enough
for
houses
and
fortifications
here
several
of
the
men
exclaimed
that
just
it
you
hit
it
exactly
i
then
asked
if
there
was
any
other
rock
on
that
side
of
the
river
which
could
answer
to
the
description
they
all
agreed
that
there
was
no
such
rock
on
either
side
along
the
whole
length
of
the
river
i
then
said
if
the
indian
town
was
in
the
place
where
i
suppose
it
to
have
been
i
can
tell
you
the
nature
of
the
country
which
lies
behind
the
hills
on
the
farther
side
of
the
river
though
i
know
nothing
about
it
except
what
i
have
learned
from
writings
nearly
two
centuries
old
from
the
top
of
the
hills
you
look
out
upon
a
great
prairie
reaching
as
far
as
you
can
see
except
that
it
is
crossed
by
a
belt
of
woods
following
the
course
of
a
stream
which
enters
the
main
river
a
few
miles
below
see
you
are
exactly
right
again
replied
clark
we
call
that
belt
of
timber
the
woods
and
the
stream
is
the
big
vermilion
then
i
said
the
big
vermilion
is
the
river
which
the
french
called
the
aramoni
rock
is
the
same
on
which
they
built
a
fort
called
louis
in
the
year
and
your
farm
is
on
the
site
of
the
great
town
of
the
illinois
i
spent
the
next
day
in
examining
these
localities
and
was
fully
confirmed
in
my
conclusions
clark
tenant
showed
me
the
spot
where
the
human
bones
were
ploughed
up
it
was
no
doubt
the
graveyard
violated
by
the
iroquois
the
illinois
returned
to
the
village
after
their
defeat
and
long
continued
to
occupy
it
the
scattered
bones
were
probably
collected
and
restored
to
their
place
of
burial

had
intrigued
successfully
among

as

the
tamaroas
the
moingona
and
others
their
general
character
and
habits
were
those
of
other
indian
tribes
but
they
were
reputed
somewhat
cowardly
and
slothful
in
their
manners
they
were
more
licentious
than
many
of
their
neighbors
and
addicted
to
practices
which
are
sometimes
supposed
to
be
the
result
of
a
perverted
civilization
young
men
enacting
the
part
of
women
were
frequently
to
be
seen
among
them
these
were
held
in
great
contempt
some
of
the
early
travellers
both
among
the
illinois
and
among
other
tribes
where
the
same
practice
prevailed
mistook
them
for
hermaphrodites
according
to
charlevoix
this
abuse
was
due
in
part
to
a
superstition
the
miamis
and
piankishaws
were
in
close
affinities
of
language
and
habits
with
the
illinois
all
these
tribes
belonged
to
the
great
algonquin
family
the
first
impressions
which
the
french
received
of
them
as
recorded
in

singularly
favorable
but
a
closer
acquaintance
did
not
confirm
them
the
illinois
traded
with
the

to
whom
they
carried
slaves
taken
in

receiving
in

guns
hatchets

on

he
gives
in
detail
the
circumstances
on
which
this
suspicion
rests
but
which
are
not
convincing
he
says
further
that
the
jesuits
gave
out
that

was

in

to
discourage
the

the
adventures
of
hennepin
hennepin
an
impostor
his
pretended
discovery
his
actual
discovery
captured
by
the
the
upper
mississippi
it
was
on
the
last
day
of
the
winter
that
preceded
the
invasion
of
the
iroquois
that
father
hennepin
with
his
two
companions
accau
and
du
gay
had
set
out
from
fort
crèvecoeur
to
explore
the
illinois
to
its
mouth
it
appears
from
his
own
later
statements
as
well
as
from
those
of
tonty
that
more
than
this
was
expected
of
him
and
that
la
salle
had
instructed
him
to
explore
not
alone
the
illinois
but
also
the
upper
mississippi
that
he
actually
did
so
there
is
no
reasonable
doubt
and
could
he
have
contented
himself
with
telling
the
truth
his
name
would
have
stood
high
as
a
bold
and
vigorous
discoverer
but
his
vicious
attempts
to
malign
his
commander
and
plunder
him
of
his
laurels
have
wrapped
his
genuine
merit
in
a
cloud
hennepin
first
book
was
published
soon
after
his
return
from
his
travels
and
while
la
salle
was
still
alive
in
it
he
relates
the
accomplishment
of
the
instructions
given
him
without
the
smallest
intimation
that
he
did
more
fourteen
years
after
when
la
salle
was
dead
he
published
another
edition
of
his
travels
in
which
he
advanced
a
new
and
surprising
pretension
reasons
connected
with
his
personal
safety
he
declares
before
compelled
him
to
remain
silent
but
a
time
at
length
had
come
when
the
truth
must
be
revealed
and
he
proceeds
to
affirm
that
before
ascending
the
mississippi
he
with
his
two
men
explored
its
whole
course
from
the
illinois
to
the
sea
thus
anticipating
the
discovery
which
forms
the
crowning
laurel
of
la
salle
sidenote
hennepin
resolution
i
am
resolved
he
says
to
make
known
here
to
the
whole
world
the
mystery
of
this
discovery
which
i
have
hitherto
concealed
that
i
might
not
offend
the
sieur
de
la
salle
who
wished
to
keep
all
the
glory
and
all
the
knowledge
of
it
to
himself
it
is
for
this
that
he
sacrificed
many
persons
whose
lives
he
exposed
to
prevent
them
from
making
known
what
they
had
seen
and
thereby
crossing
his
secret
plans
i
was
certain
that
if
i
went
down
the
mississippi
he
would
not
fail
to
traduce
me
to
my
superiors
for
not
taking
the
northern
route
which
i
was
to
have
followed
in
accordance
with
his
desire
and
the
plan
we
had
made
together
but
i
saw
myself
on
the
point
of
dying
of
hunger
and
knew
not
what
to
do
because
the
two
men
who
were
with
me
threatened
openly
to
leave
me
in
the
night
and
carry
off
the
canoe
and
everything
in
it
if
i
prevented
them
from
going
down
the
river
to
the
nations
below
finding
myself
in
this
dilemma
i
thought
that
i
ought
not
to
hesitate
and
that
i
ought
to
prefer
my
own
safety
to
the
violent
passion
which
possessed
the
sieur
de
la
salle
of
enjoying
alone
the
glory
of
this
discovery
the
two
men
seeing
that
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
follow
them
promised
me
entire
fidelity
so
after
we
had
shaken
hands
together
as
a
mutual
pledge
we
set
out
on
our
voyage
he
then
proceeds
to
recount
at
length
the
particulars
of
his
alleged
exploration
the
story
was
distrusted
from
the
first
why
had
he
not
told
it
before
an
excess
of
modesty
a
lack
of
or
a
too
sensitive
reluctance
to
wound
the
susceptibilities
of
others
had
never
been
found
among
his
foibles
yet
some
perhaps
might
have
believed
him
had
he
not
in
the
first
edition
of
his
book
gratuitously
and
distinctly
declared
that
he
did
not
make
the
voyage
in
question
we
had
some
designs
he
says
of
going
down
the
river
colbert
mississippi
as
far
as
its
mouth
but
the
tribes
that
took
us
prisoners
gave
us
no
time
to
navigate
this
river
both
up
and
down
sidenote
hennepin
an
impostor
in
declaring
to
the
world
the
achievement
which
he
had
so
long
concealed
and
so
explicitly
denied
the
worthy
missionary
found
himself
in
serious
embarrassment
in
his
first
book
he
had
stated
that
on
the
twelfth
of
march
he
left
the
mouth
of
the
illinois
on
his
way
northward
and
that
on
the
eleventh
of
april
he
was
captured
by
the
sioux
near
the
mouth
of
the
wisconsin
five
hundred
miles
above
this
would
give
him
only
a
month
to
make
his
alleged
from
the
illinois
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
again
upward
to
the
place
of
his
capture
a
distance
of
three
thousand
two
hundred
and
sixty
miles
with
his
means
of
transportation
three
months
would
have
been
insufficient
he
saw
the
difficulty
but
on
the
other
hand
he
saw
that
he
could
not
greatly
change
either
date
without
confusing
the
parts
of
his
narrative
which
preceded
and
which
followed
in
this
perplexity
he
chose
a
middle
course
which
only
involved
him
in
additional
contradictions
having
as
he
affirms
gone
down
to
the
gulf
and
returned
to
the
mouth
of
the
illinois
he
set
out
thence
to
explore
the
river
above
and
he
assigns
the
of
april
as
the
date
of
this
departure
this
gives
him
days
for
his
voyage
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
back
looking
further
we
find
that
having
left
the
illinois
on
the
he
paddled
his
canoe
two
hundred
leagues
northward
and
was
then
captured
by
the
sioux
on
the
twelfth
of
the
same
month
in
short
he
ensnares
himself
in
a
hopeless
confusion
of
dates
here
one
would
think
is
sufficient
reason
for
rejecting
his
story
and
yet
the
general
truth
of
the
descriptions
and
a
certain
verisimilitude
which
marks
it
might
easily
deceive
a
careless
reader
and
perplex
a
critical
one
these
however
are
easily
explained
six
years
before
hennepin
published
his
pretended
discovery
his
brother
friar
father
chrétien
le
clerc
published
an
account
of
the
récollet
missions
among
the
indians
under
the
title
of
établissement
de
la
foi
this
book
offensive
to
the
jesuits
is
said
to
have
been
suppressed
by
order
of
government
but
a
few
copies
fortunately
survive
one
of
these
is
now
before
me
it
contains
the
journal
of
father
zenobe
membré
on
his
descent
of
the
mississippi
in
in
company
with
la
salle
the
slightest
comparison
of
his
narrative
with
that
of
hennepin
is
sufficient
to
show
that
the
latter
framed
his
own
story
out
of
incidents
and
descriptions
furnished
by
his
brother
missionary
often
using
his
very
words
and
sometimes
copying
entire
pages
with
no
other
alterations
than
such
as
were
necessary
to
make
himself
instead
of
la
salle
and
his
companions
the
hero
of
the
exploit
the
records
of
literary
piracy
may
be
searched
in
vain
for
an
act
of
depredation
more
recklessly
impudent
such
being
the
case
what
faith
can
we
put
in
the
rest
of
story
fortunately
there
are
tests
by
which
the
earlier
parts
of
his
book
can
be
tried
and
on
the
whole
they
square
exceedingly
well
with
contemporary
records
of
undoubted
authenticity
bating
his
exaggerations
respecting
the
falls
of
niagara
his
local
descriptions
and
even
his
estimates
of
distance
are
generally
accurate
he
constantly
it
is
true
magnifies
his
own
acts
and
thrusts
himself
forward
as
one
of
the
chiefs
of
an
enterprise
to
the
costs
of
which
he
had
contributed
nothing
and
to
which
he
was
merely
an
appendage
and
yet
till
he
reaches
the
mississippi
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
in
the
main
he
tells
the
truth
as
for
his
ascent
of
that
river
to
the
country
of
the
sioux
the
general
statement
is
fully
confirmed
by
la
salle
tonty
and
other
contemporary
writers
for
the
details
of
the
journey
we
must
rest
on
hennepin
alone
whose
account
of
the
country
and
of
the
peculiar
traits
of
its
indian
occupants
afford
as
far
as
they
go
good
evidence
of
truth
indeed
this
part
of
his
narrative
could
only
have
been
written
by
one
well
versed
in
the
savage
life
of
this
northwestern
region
trusting
then
to
his
own
guidance
in
the
absence
of
better
let
us
follow
in
the
wake
of
his
adventurous
canoe
sidenote
his
voyage
northward
it
was
laden
deeply
with
goods
belonging
to
la
salle
and
meant
by
him
as
presents
to
indians
on
the
way
though
the
travellers
it
appears
proposed
to
use
them
in
trading
on
their
own
account
the
friar
was
still
wrapped
in
his
gray
capote
and
hood
shod
with
sandals
and
decorated
with
the
cord
of
francis
as
for
his
two
companions
accau
and
du
gay
it
is
tolerably
clear
that
the
former
was
the
real
leader
of
the
party
though
hennepin
after
his
custom
thrusts
himself
into
the
foremost
place
both
were
somewhat
above
the
station
of
ordinary
hired
hands
and
du
gay
had
an
uncle
who
was
an
ecclesiastic
of
good
credit
at
amiens
his
native
place
in
the
forests
that
overhung
the
river
the
buds
were
feebly
swelling
with
advancing
spring
there
was
game
enough
they
killed
buffalo
deer
beavers
wild
turkeys
and
now
and
then
a
bear
swimming
in
the
river
with
these
and
the
fish
which
they
caught
in
abundance
they
fared
sumptuously
though
it
was
the
season
of
lent
they
were
exemplary
however
at
their
devotions
hennepin
said
prayers
at
morning
and
night
and
the
at
noon
adding
a
petition
to
saint
anthony
of
padua
that
he
would
save
them
from
the
peril
that
beset
their
way
in
truth
there
was
a
lion
in
the
path
the
ferocious
character
of
the
sioux
or
dacotah
who
occupied
the
region
of
the
upper
mississippi
was
already
known
to
the
french
and
hennepin
with
excellent
reason
prayed
that
it
might
be
his
fortune
to
meet
them
not
by
night
but
by
day
sidenote
captured
by
the
sioux
on
the
eleventh
or
twelfth
of
april
they
stopped
in
the
afternoon
to
repair
their
canoe
and
hennepin
busied
himself
in
daubing
it
with
pitch
while
the
others
cooked
a
turkey
suddenly
a
fleet
of
sioux
canoes
swept
into
sight
bearing
a
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
naked
savages
who
on
seeing
the
travellers
raised
a
hideous
clamor
and
some
leaping
ashore
and
others
into
the
water
they
surrounded
the
astonished
frenchmen
in
an
instant
hennepin
held
out
the
but
one
of
them
snatched
it
from
him
next
he
hastened
to
proffer
a
gift
of
martinique
tobacco
which
was
better
received
some
of
the
old
warriors
repeated
the
name
giving
him
to
understand
that
they
were
a
on
the
way
to
attack
the
miamis
on
which
hennepin
with
the
help
of
signs
and
of
marks
which
he
drew
on
the
sand
with
a
stick
explained
that
the
miamis
had
gone
across
the
mississippi
beyond
their
reach
hereupon
he
says
that
three
or
four
old
men
placed
their
hands
on
his
head
and
began
a
dismal
wailing
while
he
with
his
handkerchief
wiped
away
their
tears
in
order
to
evince
sympathy
with
their
affliction
from
whatever
cause
arising
notwithstanding
this
demonstration
of
tenderness
they
refused
to
smoke
with
him
in
his
and
forced
him
and
his
companions
to
embark
and
paddle
across
the
river
while
they
all
followed
behind
uttering
yells
and
howlings
which
froze
the
missionary
blood
on
reaching
the
farther
side
they
made
their
and
allowed
their
prisoners
to
do
the
same
accau
and
du
gay
slung
their
kettle
while
hennepin
to
propitiate
the
sioux
carried
to
them
two
turkeys
of
which
there
were
several
in
the
canoe
the
warriors
had
seated
themselves
in
a
ring
to
debate
on
the
fate
of
the
frenchmen
and
two
chiefs
presently
explained
to
the
friar
by
significant
signs
that
it
had
been
resolved
that
his
head
should
be
split
with
a
this
produced
the
effect
which
was
no
doubt
intended
hennepin
ran
to
the
canoe
and
quickly
returned
with
one
of
the
men
both
loaded
with
presents
which
he
threw
into
the
midst
of
the
assembly
and
then
bowing
his
head
offered
them
at
the
same
time
a
hatchet
with
which
to
kill
him
if
they
wished
to
do
so
his
gifts
and
his
submission
seemed
to
appease
them
they
gave
him
and
his
companions
a
dish
of
flesh
but
to
his
great
concern
they
returned
his
an
act
which
he
interpreted
as
a
sign
of
danger
that
night
the
frenchmen
slept
little
expecting
to
be
murdered
before
morning
there
was
in
fact
a
great
division
of
opinion
among
the
sioux
some
were
for
killing
them
and
taking
their
goods
while
others
eager
above
all
things
that
french
traders
should
come
among
them
with
the
knives
hatchets
and
guns
of
which
they
had
heard
the
value
contended
that
it
would
be
impolitic
to
discourage
the
trade
by
putting
to
death
its
pioneers
scarcely
had
morning
dawned
on
the
anxious
captives
when
a
young
chief
naked
and
painted
from
head
to
foot
appeared
before
them
and
asked
for
the
pipe
which
the
friar
gladly
gave
him
he
filled
it
smoked
it
made
the
warriors
do
the
same
and
having
given
this
hopeful
pledge
of
amity
told
the
frenchmen
that
since
the
miamis
were
out
of
reach
the
would
return
home
and
that
they
must
accompany
them
to
this
hennepin
gladly
agreed
having
as
he
declares
his
great
work
of
exploration
so
much
at
heart
that
he
rejoiced
in
the
prospect
of
achieving
it
even
in
their
company
sidenote
suspected
of
sorcery
he
soon
however
had
a
foretaste
of
the
affliction
in
store
for
him
for
when
he
opened
his
breviary
and
began
to
mutter
his
morning
devotion
his
new
companions
gathered
about
him
with
faces
that
betrayed
their
superstitious
terror
and
gave
him
to
understand
that
his
book
was
a
bad
spirit
with
which
he
must
hold
no
more
converse
they
thought
indeed
that
he
was
muttering
a
charm
for
their
destruction
accau
and
du
gay
conscious
of
the
danger
begged
the
friar
to
dispense
with
his
devotions
lest
he
and
they
alike
should
be
tomahawked
but
hennepin
says
that
his
sense
of
duty
rose
superior
to
his
fears
and
that
he
was
resolved
to
repeat
his
office
at
all
hazards
though
not
until
he
had
asked
pardon
of
his
two
friends
for
thus
imperilling
their
lives
fortunately
he
presently
discovered
a
device
by
which
his
devotion
and
his
prudence
were
completely
reconciled
he
ceased
the
muttering
which
had
alarmed
the
indians
and
with
the
breviary
open
on
his
knees
sang
the
service
in
loud
and
cheerful
tones
as
this
had
no
savor
of
sorcery
and
as
they
now
imagined
that
the
book
was
teaching
its
owner
to
sing
for
their
amusement
they
conceived
a
favorable
opinion
of
both
alike
these
sioux
it
may
be
observed
were
the
ancestors
of
those
who
committed
the
horrible
but
not
unprovoked
massacres
of
in
the
valley
of
the
peter
hennepin
complains
bitterly
of
their
treatment
of
him
which
however
seems
to
have
been
tolerably
good
afraid
that
he
would
lag
behind
as
his
canoe
was
heavy
and
slow
they
placed
several
warriors
in
it
to
aid
him
and
his
men
in
paddling
they
kept
on
their
way
from
morning
till
night
building
huts
for
their
bivouac
when
it
rained
and
sleeping
on
the
open
ground
when
the
weather
was
fair
which
says
hennepin
gave
us
a
good
opportunity
to
contemplate
the
moon
and
stars
the
three
frenchmen
took
the
precaution
of
sleeping
at
the
side
of
the
young
chief
who
had
been
the
first
to
smoke
the
and
who
seemed
inclined
to
befriend
them
but
there
was
another
chief
one
aquipaguetin
a
crafty
old
savage
who
having
lost
a
son
in
war
with
the
miamis
was
angry
that
the
party
had
abandoned
their
expedition
and
thus
deprived
him
of
his
revenge
he
therefore
kept
up
a
dismal
lament
through
half
the
night
while
other
old
men
crouching
over
hennepin
as
he
lay
trying
to
sleep
stroked
him
with
their
hands
and
uttered
wailings
so
lugubrious
that
he
was
forced
to
the
belief
that
he
had
been
doomed
to
death
and
that
they
were
charitably
bemoaning
his
fate
sidenote
the
captive
friar
one
night
the
captives
were
for
some
reason
unable
to
bivouac
near
their
protector
and
were
forced
to
make
their
fire
at
the
end
of
the
camp
here
they
were
soon
beset
by
a
crowd
of
indians
who
told
them
that
aquipaguetin
had
at
length
resolved
to
tomahawk
them
the
malcontents
were
gathered
in
a
knot
at
a
little
distance
and
hennepin
hastened
to
appease
them
by
another
gift
of
knives
and
tobacco
this
was
but
one
of
the
devices
of
the
old
chief
to
deprive
them
of
their
goods
without
robbing
them
outright
he
had
with
him
the
bones
of
a
deceased
relative
which
he
was
carrying
home
wrapped
in
skins
prepared
with
smoke
after
the
indian
fashion
and
gayly
decorated
with
bands
of
dyed
porcupine
quills
he
would
summon
his
warriors
and
placing
these
relics
in
the
midst
of
the
assembly
call
on
all
present
to
smoke
in
their
honor
after
which
hennepin
was
required
to
offer
a
more
substantial
tribute
in
the
shape
of
cloth
beads
hatchets
tobacco
and
the
like
to
be
laid
upon
the
bundle
of
bones
the
gifts
thus
acquired
were
then
in
the
name
of
the
deceased
distributed
among
the
persons
present
on
one
occasion
aquipaguetin
killed
a
bear
and
invited
the
chiefs
and
warriors
to
feast
upon
it
they
accordingly
assembled
on
a
prairie
west
of
the
river
where
after
the
banquet
they
danced
a
they
were
all
painted
from
head
to
foot
with
their
hair
oiled
garnished
with
red
and
white
feathers
and
powdered
with
the
down
of
birds
in
this
guise
they
set
their
arms
akimbo
and
fell
to
stamping
with
such
fury
that
the
hard
prairie
was
dented
with
the
prints
of
their
moccasins
while
the
chief
son
crying
at
the
top
of
his
throat
gave
to
each
in
turn
the
pipe
of
war
meanwhile
the
chief
himself
singing
in
a
loud
and
rueful
voice
placed
his
hands
on
the
heads
of
the
three
frenchmen
and
from
time
to
time
interrupted
his
music
to
utter
a
vehement
harangue
hennepin
could
not
understand
the
words
but
his
heart
sank
as
the
conviction
grew
strong
within
him
that
these
ceremonies
tended
to
his
destruction
it
seems
however
that
after
all
the
chief
efforts
his
party
was
in
the
minority
the
greater
part
being
adverse
to
either
killing
or
robbing
the
three
strangers
every
morning
at
daybreak
an
old
warrior
shouted
the
signal
of
departure
and
the
recumbent
savages
leaped
up
manned
their
birchen
fleet
and
plied
their
paddles
against
the
current
often
without
waiting
to
break
their
fast
sometimes
they
stopped
for
a
on
the
neighboring
prairies
and
there
was
no
lack
of
provisions
they
passed
lake
pepin
which
hennepin
called
the
lake
of
tears
by
reason
of
the
howlings
and
lamentations
here
uttered
over
him
by
aquipaguetin
and
nineteen
days
after
his
capture
landed
near
the

in

the
indians
broke
his
canoe
to
pieces
having
first
hidden
their
own
among
the
as
they
belonged
to
different
bands
and
different
villages
their
mutual
jealousy
now
overcame
all
their
prudence
and
each
proceeded
to
claim
his
share
of
the
captives
and
the
booty
happily
they
made
an
amicable
distribution
or
it
would
have
fared
ill
with
the
three
frenchmen
and
each
taking
his
share
not
forgetting
the
priestly
vestments
of
hennepin
the
splendor
of
which
they
could
not
sufficiently
admire
they
set
out
across
the
country
for
their
villages
which
lay
towards
the
north
in
the
neighborhood

called

hennepin
exceedingly
tall

active

walked
at
a
prodigious
speed
insomuch
that
no
european
could
long
keep
pace
with
them
though
the
month
of
may
had
begun
there
were
frosts
at
night
and
the
marshes
and
ponds
were
glazed
with
ice
which
cut
the
legs
as
he
waded
through
they
swam
the
larger
streams
and
hennepin
nearly
perished
with
cold
as
he
emerged
from
the
icy
current
his
two
companions
who
were
smaller
than
he
and
who
could
not
swim
were
carried
over
on
the
backs
of
the
indians
they
showed
however
no
little
endurance
and
he
declares
that
he
should
have
dropped
by
the
way
but
for
their
support
seeing
him
disposed
to
lag
the
indians
to
spur
him
on

to
the
dry
grass
behind
him
and
then
taking
him
by
the
hands
ran
forward
with
him
to
escape
the
flames
to
add
to
his
misery
he
was
nearly
famished
as
they
gave
him
only
a
small
piece
of
smoked
meat
once
a
day
though
it
does
not
appear
that
they
themselves
fared
better

the
fifth

excellent
critical
examination
of
hennepin
works
his
plagiarisms
from
le
clerc
are
not
confined
to
the
passages
cited
above
for
in
his
later
editions
he
stole
largely
from
other
parts
of
the
suppressed
de
la
it
is
certain
that
persons
having
the
best
means
of
information
believed
at
the
time
in
hennepin
story
of
his
journeys
on
the
upper
mississippi
the
compiler
of
the
des
who
was
in
close
relations
with
la
salle
and
those
who
acted
with
him
does
not
intimate
a
doubt
of
the
truth
of
the
report
which
hennepin
on
his
return
gave
to
the
provincial
commissary
of
his
order
and
which
is
in
substance
the
same
which
he
published
two
years
later
the
it
is
to
be
observed
was
written
only
a
few
months
after
the
return
of
hennepin
and
embodies
the
pith
of
his
narrative
of
the
upper
mississippi
no
part
of
which
had
then
been
published
in
this
connection
it
is
well
to
examine
the
various
sioux
words
which
hennepin
uses
incidentally
and
which
he
must
have
acquired
by
personal
intercourse
with
the
tribe
as
no
frenchman
then
understood
the
language
these
words
as
far
as
my
information
reaches
are
in
every
instance
correct
thus
he
says
that
the
sioux
called
his
breviary
a
bad
spirit
or
would
express
the
same
meaning
in
modern
english
spelling
he
says
elsewhere
that
they
called
the
guns
of
his
companions
which
he
translates
iron
possessed
with
a
bad
spirit
the
western
sioux
to
this
day
call
a
gun
metal
possessed
with
a
spirit
shonka
a
dog
wahsee
a
shinnan
a
robe
or
garment
and
other
words
are
given
correctly
with
their
interpretations
the
word
affirmed
by
hennepin
to
mean
the
sun
seems
at
first
sight
a
wilful
inaccuracy
as
this
is
not
the
word
used
in
general
by
the
sioux
the
yankton
band
of
this
people
however
call
the
sun
which
it
is
evident
represents
the
french
pronunciation
of
omitting
the
initial
letter
this
hennepin
would
be
apt
enough
to
supply
thereby
conferring
a
compliment
alike
on
himself
louis
hennepin
and
on
the
king
louis
who
to
the
indignation
of
his
brother
monarchs
had
chosen
the
sun
as
his
emblem
various
trivial
incidents
touched
upon
by
hennepin
while
recounting
his
life
among
the
sioux
seem
to
me
to
afford
a
strong
presumption
of
an
actual
experience
i
speak
on
this
point
with
the
more
confidence
as
the
indians
in
whose
lodges
i
was
once
domesticated
for
several
weeks
belonged
to
a
western
band
of
the
same
people
called
ako
by
hennepin
in
contemporary
documents
it
is
written
accau
acau
dacau
dacan
and
the
edition
of
says
that
there
were
canoes
that
of
raises
the
number
to
fifty
the
number
of
indians
is
the
same
in
both
the
later
narrative
is
more
in
detail
than
the
former
and
yet
it
had
by
his
account
made
a
distance
of
thirteen
hundred
and
eighty
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
upward
in
days
this
weeping
and
wailing
over
hennepin
once
seemed
to
me
an
anomaly
in
his
account
of
sioux
manners
as
i
am
not
aware
that
such
practices
are
to
be
found
among
them
at
present
they
are
mentioned
however
by
other
early
writers
le
sueur
who
was
among
them
in
was
wept
over
no
less
than
hennepin
see
the
abstract
of
his
journal
in
la
harpe
chapter
xviii
hennepin
among
the
sioux
signs
of
hennepin
and
his
indian
the
hunting
the
sioux
falls
of
st
a
vagabond
friar
his
adventures
on
the
greysolon
du
return
to
civilization
as
hennepin
entered
the
village
he
beheld
a
sight
which
caused
him
to
invoke
saint
anthony
of
padua
in
front
of
the
lodges
were
certain
stakes
to
which
were
attached
bundles
of
straw
intended
as
he
supposed
for
burning
him
and
his
friends
alive
his
concern
was
redoubled
when
he
saw
the
condition
of
the
picard
du
gay
whose
hair
and
face
had
been
painted
with
divers
colors
and
whose
head
was
decorated
with
a
tuft
of
white
feathers
in
this
guise
he
was
entering
the
village
followed
by
a
crowd
of
sioux
who
compelled
him
to
sing
and
keep
time
to
his
own
music
by
rattling
a
dried
gourd
containing
a
number
of
pebbles
the
omens
indeed
were
exceedingly
threatening
for
treatment
like
this
was
usually
followed
by
the
speedy
immolation
of
the
captive
hennepin
ascribes
it
to
the
effect
of
his
invocations
that
being
led
into
one
of
the
lodges
among
a
throng
of
staring
squaws
and
children
he
and
his
companions
were
seated
on
the
ground
and
presented
with
large
dishes
of
containing
a
mess
of
wild
rice
boiled
with
dried
whortleberries
a
repast
which
he
declares
to
have
been
the
best
that
had
fallen
to
his
lot
since
the
day
of
his
captivity
sidenote
the
sioux
this
soothed
his
fears
but
as
he
allayed
his
famished
appetite
he
listened
with
anxious
interest
to
the
vehement
jargon
of
the
chiefs
and
warriors
who
were
disputing
among
themselves
to
whom
the
three
captives
should
respectively
belong
for
it
seems
that
as
far
as
related
to
them
the
question
of
distribution
had
not
yet
been
definitely
settled
the
debate
ended
in
the
assigning
of
hennepin
to
his
old
enemy
aquipaguetin
who
however
far
from
persisting
in
his
evil
designs
adopted
him
on
the
spot
as
his
son
the
three
companions
must
now
part
company
du
gay
not
yet
quite
reassured
of
his
safety
hastened
to
confess
himself
to
hennepin
but
accau
proved
refractory
and
refused
the
offices
of
religion
which
did
not
prevent
the
friar
from
embracing
them
both
as
he
says
with
an
extreme
tenderness
tired
as
he
was
he
was
forced
to
set
out
with
his
father
to
his
village
which
was
fortunately
not
far
off
an
unpleasant
walk
of
a
few
miles
through
woods
and
marshes
brought
them
to
the
borders
of
a
sheet
of
water
apparently
lake
buade
where
five
of
aquipaguetin
wives
received
the
party
in
three
canoes
and
ferried
them
to
an
island
on
which
the
village
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
chief
lodge
hennepin
was
met
by
a
decrepit
old
indian
withered
with
age
who
offered
him
the
and
placed
him
on
a
which
was
spread
by
the
fire
here
to
relieve
his
fatigue
for
he
was
spent
a
small
boy
anointed
his
limbs
with
the
fat
of
a
supposed
to
be
sovereign
in
these
cases
by
reason
of
the
great
agility
of
that
animal
his
new
father
gave
him
a
of
fish
covered
him
with
a
and
showed
him
six
or
seven
of
his
wives
who
were
thenceforth
he
was
told
to
regard
him
as
a
son
the
chief
household
was
numerous
and
his
allies
and
relatives
formed
a
considerable
clan
of
which
the
missionary
found
himself
an
involuntary
member
he
was
scandalized
when
he
saw
one
of
his
adopted
brothers
carrying
on
his
back
the
bones
of
a
deceased
friend
wrapped
in
the
chasuble
of
brocade
which
they
had
taken
with
other
vestments
from
his
box
sidenote
hennepin
as
a
missionary
seeing
their
new
relative
so
enfeebled
that
he
could
scarcely
stand
the
indians
made
for
him
one
of
their
sweating
baths
where
they
immersed
him
in
steam
three
times
a
week
a
process
from
which
he
thinks
he
derived
great
benefit
his
strength
gradually
returned
in
spite
of
his
meagre
fare
for
there
was
a
dearth
of
food
and
the
squaws
were
less
attentive
to
his
wants
than
to
those
of
their
children
they
respected
him
however
as
a
person
endowed
with
occult
powers
and
stood
in
no
little
awe
of
a
pocket
compass
which
he
had
with
him
as
well
as
of
a
small
metal
pot
with
feet
moulded
after
the
face
of
a
lion
this
last
seemed
in
their
eyes
a
medicine
of
the
most
formidable
nature
and
they
would
not
touch
it
without
first
wrapping
it
in
a
for
the
rest
hennepin
made
himself
useful
in
various
ways
he
shaved
the
heads
of
the
children
as
was
the
custom
of
the
tribe
bled
certain
asthmatic
persons
and
dosed
others
with
orvietan
the
famous
panacea
of
his
time
of
which
he
had
brought
with
him
a
good
supply
with
respect
to
his
missionary
functions
he
seems
to
have
given
himself
little
trouble
unless
his
attempt
to
make
a
sioux
vocabulary
is
to
be
regarded
as
preparatory
to
a
future
apostleship
i
could
gain
nothing
over
them
he
says
in
the
way
of
their
salvation
by
reason
of
their
natural
stupidity
nevertheless
on
one
occasion
he
baptized
a
sick
child
naming
it
antoinette
in
honor
of
saint
anthony
of
padua
it
seemed
to
revive
after
the
rite
but
soon
relapsed
and
presently
died
which
he
writes
gave
me
great
joy
and
satisfaction
in
this
he
was
like
the
jesuits
who
could
find
nothing
but
consolation
in
the
death
of
a
newly
baptized
infant
since
it
was
thus
assured
of
a
paradise
which
had
it
lived
it
would
probably
have
forfeited
by
sharing
in
the
superstitions
of
its
parents
with
respect
to
hennepin
and
his
indian
father
there
seems
to
have
been
little
love
on
either
side
but
ouasicoudé
the
principal
chief
of
the
sioux
of
this
region
was
the
fast
friend
of
the
three
white
men
he
was
angry
that
they
had
been
robbed
which
he
had
been
unable
to
prevent
as
the
sioux
had
no
laws
and
their
chiefs
little
power
but
he
spoke
his
mind
freely
and
told
aquipaguetin
and
the
rest
in
full
council
that
they
were
like
a
dog
who
steals
a
piece
of
meat
from
a
dish
and
runs
away
with
it
when
hennepin
complained
of
hunger
the
indians
had
always
promised
him
that
early
in
the
summer
he
should
go
with
them
on
a
buffalo
hunt
and
have
food
in
abundance
the
time
at
length
came
and
the
inhabitants
of
all
the
neighboring
villages
prepared
for
departure
to
each
band
was
assigned
its
special
and
he
was
expected
to
accompany
his
indian
father
to
this
he
demurred
for
he
feared
lest
aquipaguetin
angry
at
the
words
of
the
great
chief
might
take
this
opportunity
to
revenge
the
insult
put
upon
him
he
therefore
gave
out
that
he
expected
a
party
of
spirits
that
is
to
say
frenchmen
to
meet
him
at
the
mouth
of
the
wisconsin
bringing
a
supply
of
goods
for
the
indians
and
he
declares
that
la
salle
had
in
fact
promised
to
send
traders
to
that
place
be
this
as
it
may
the
indians
believed
him
and
true
or
false
the
assertion
as
will
be
seen
answered
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
made
sidenote
camp
of
savages
the
indians
set
out
in
a
body
to
the
number
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
warriors
with
their
women
and
children
the
three
frenchmen
who
though
in
different
villages
had
occasionally
met
during
the
two
months
of
their
captivity
were
all
of
the
party
they
descended
rum
river
which
forms
the
outlet
of
mille
lac
and
which
is
called
the
francis
by
hennepin
none
of
the
indians
had
offered
to
give
him
passage
and
fearing
lest
he
should
be
abandoned
he
stood
on
the
bank
hailing
the
passing
canoes
and
begging
to
be
taken
in
accau
and
du
gay
presently
appeared
paddling
a
small
canoe
which
the
indians
had
given
them
but
they
would
not
listen
to
the
missionary
call
and
accau
who
had
no
love
for
him
cried
out
that
he
had
paddled
him
long
enough
already
two
indians
however
took
pity
on
him
and
brought
him
to
the
place
of
encampment
where
du
gay
tried
to
excuse
himself
for
his
conduct
but
accau
was
sullen
and
kept
aloof
after
reaching
the
mississippi
the
whole
party
encamped
together
opposite
to
the
mouth
of
rum
river
pitching
their
tents
of
skin
or
building
their
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
by
the
side
of
the
water
it
was
a
wild
scene
this
camp
of
savages
among
whom
as
yet
no
traders
had
come
and
no
handiwork
of
civilization
had
found
its
way
the
tall
warriors
some
nearly
naked
some
wrapped
in
and
some
in
shirts
of
dressed
fringed
with
hair
and
embroidered
with
dyed
porcupine
quills
of
stone
in
their
hands
and
quivers
at
their
backs
filled
with
arrows
the
squaws
cutting
meat
with
knives
of
flint
and
boiling
it
in
rude
earthen
pots
of
their
own
making
driving
away
meanwhile
with
shrill
cries
the
troops
of
lean
dogs
which
disputed
the
meal
with
a
crew
of
hungry
children
the
whole
camp
indeed
was
threatened
with
starvation
the
three
white
men
could
get
no
food
but
unripe
berries
from
the
effects
of
which
hennepin
thinks
they
might
all
have
died
but
for
timely
doses
of
his
orvietan
sidenote
falls
of
st
anthony
being
tired
of
the
indians
he
became
anxious
to
set
out
for
the
wisconsin
to
find
the
party
of
frenchmen
real
or
imaginary
who
were
to
meet
him
at
that
place
that
he
was
permitted
to
do
so
was
due
to
the
influence
of
the
great
chief
ouasicoudé
who
always
befriended
him
and
who
had
soundly
berated
his
two
companions
for
refusing
him
a
seat
in
their
canoe
du
gay
wished
to
go
with
him
but
accau
who
liked
the
indian
life
as
much
as
he
disliked
hennepin
preferred
to
remain
with
the
hunters
a
small
was
given
to
the
two
adventurers
together
with
an
earthen
pot
and
they
had
also
between
them
a
gun
a
knife
and
a
robe
of
thus
equipped
they
began
their
journey
and
soon
approached
the
falls
of
anthony
so
named
by
hennepin
in
honor
of
the
inevitable
saint
anthony
of
padua
as
they
were
carrying
their
canoe
by
the
cataract
they
saw
five
or
six
indians
who
had
gone
before
and
one
of
whom
had
climbed
into
an
beside
the
principal
fall
whence
in
a
loud
and
lamentable
voice
he
was
haranguing
the
spirit
of
the
waters
as
a
sacrifice
to
whom
he
had
just
hung
a
robe
of
among
the
branches
their
attention
was
soon
engrossed
by
another
object
looking
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
which
overhung
the
river
below
the
falls
hennepin
saw
a
snake
which
as
he
avers
was
six
feet
long
writhing
upward
towards
the
holes
of
the
swallows
in
the
face
of
the
precipice
in
order
to
devour
their
young
he
pointed
him
out
to
du
gay
and
they
pelted
him
with
stones
till
he
fell
into
the
river
but
not
before
his
contortions
and
the
darting
of
his
forked
tongue
had
so
affected
the
picard
imagination
that
he
was
haunted
that
night
with
a
terrific
incubus
sidenote
adventures
they
paddled
sixty
leagues
down
the
river
in
the
heats
of
july
and
killed
no
large
game
but
a
single
deer
the
meat
of
which
soon
spoiled
their
main
resource
was
the
turtles
whose
shyness
and
watchfulness
caused
them
frequent
disappointments
and
many
involuntary
fasts
they
once
captured
one
of
more
than
common
size
and
as
they
were
endeavoring
to
cut
off
his
head
he
was
near
avenging
himself
by
snapping
off
hennepin
finger
there
was
a
herd
of
buffalo
in
sight
on
the
neighboring
prairie
and
du
gay
went
with
his
gun
in
pursuit
of
them
leaving
the
turtle
in
hennepin
custody
scarcely
was
he
gone
when
the
friar
raising
his
eyes
saw
that
their
canoe
which
they
had
left
at
the
edge
of
the
water
had
floated
out
into
the
current
hastily
turning
the
turtle
on
his
back
he
covered
him
with
his
habit
of
francis
on
which
for
greater
security
he
laid
a
number
of
stones
and
then
being
a
good
swimmer
struck
out
in
pursuit
of
the
canoe
which
he
at
length
overtook
finding
that
it
would
overset
if
he
tried
to
climb
into
it
he
pushed
it
before
him
to
the
shore
and
then
paddled
towards
the
place
at
some
distance
above
where
he
had
left
the
turtle
he
had
no
sooner
reached
it
than
he
heard
a
strange
sound
and
beheld
a
long

no

became
his
apostolic
vocation
he
shouted
to
du
gay
who
presently
appeared
running
in
all
haste
and
they
both
paddled
in
pursuit
of
the
game
du
gay
aimed
at
a
young
cow
and
shot
her
in
the
head
she
fell
in
shallow
water
near
an
island
where
some
of
the
herd
had
landed
and
being
unable
to
drag
her
out
they
waded
into
the
water
and
butchered
her
where
she
lay
it
was
hours
since
they
had
tasted
food
hennepin
made
a
fire
while
du
gay
cut
up
the
meat
they
feasted
so
bountifully
that
they
both
fell
ill
and
were
forced
to
remain
two
days
on
the
island
taking
doses
of
orvietan
before
they
were
able
to
resume
their
journey
apparently
they
were
not
sufficiently
versed
in
woodcraft
to
smoke
the
meat
of
the
cow
and
the
hot
sun
soon
robbed
them
of
it
they
had
a
few
fishhooks
but
were
not
always
successful
in
the
use
of
them
on
one
occasion
being
nearly
famished
they
set
their
line
and
lay
watching
it
uttering
prayers
in
turn
suddenly
there
was
a
great
turmoil
in
the
water
du
gay
ran
to
the
line
and
with
the
help
of
hennepin
drew
in
two
large
the
eagles
or
now
and
then
dropped
a
newly
caught
fish
of
which
they
gladly
took
possession
and
once
they
found
a
purveyor
in
an
otter
which
they
saw
by
the
bank
devouring
some
object
of
an
appearance
so
wonderful
that
du
gay
cried
out
that
he
had
a
devil
between
his
paws
they
scared
him
from
his
prey
which
proved
to
be
a
or
as
hennepin
correctly
describes
it
a
species
of
sturgeon
with
a
bony
projection
from
his
snout
in
the
shape
of
a
paddle
they
broke
their
fast
upon
him
undeterred
by
this
eccentric
appendage
sidenote

upper

if
hennepin
had
had
an
eye
for
scenery
he
would
have
found
in
these
his
vagabond
rovings
wherewith
to
console
himself
in
some
measure
for
his
frequent
fasts
the
young
mississippi
fresh
from
its
northern
springs
unstained
as
yet
by
unhallowed
union
with
the
riotous
missouri
flowed
calmly
on
its
way
amid
strange
and
unique
beauties
a
wilderness
clothed
with
velvet
grass
valleys
lofty
heights
whose
smooth
slopes
seemed
levelled
with
the
scythe

and
pinnacles
ramparts
and
ruined
towers

no
human
hand

the
voyagers

on

tranquil
current

in
the
shade
of

crags

with
honeysuckles

dells

with
the
flowers
of

and

matted

passed

great
cliff
whence
the
indian
maiden
threw
herself
in
her
despair
and
lake

lay
before
them
slumbering
in
the
july
sun
the
sheets
of
sparkling
water
the
woody
slopes
the
crags
the
grassy
heights
basking
in
sunlight
or
shadowed
by
the
passing
cloud
all
the
fair
outline
of
its
graceful
scenery
the
finished
and
polished
of
nature
and
when
at
evening
they
made
their
bivouac

and
drew
up
their
canoe
while
dim
sultry
clouds
veiled
the
west
and
the
flashes
of
the
silent
gleamed
on
the
leaden
water
they
could
listen
as
they
smoked
their
pipes
to
the
mournful
cry
of
the
whippoorwills
and
the
quavering
scream
of
the
owls
other
thoughts
than
the
study
of
the
picturesque
occupied
the
mind
of
hennepin
when
one
day
he
saw
his
indian
father
aquipaguetin
whom
he
had
supposed
five
hundred
miles
distant
descending
the
river
with
ten
warriors
in
canoes
he
was
eager
to
be
the
first
to
meet
the
traders
who
as
hennepin
had
given
out
were
to
come
with
their
goods
to
the
mouth
of
the
wisconsin
the
two
travellers
trembled
for
the
consequences
of
this
encounter
but
the
chief
after
a
short
colloquy
passed
on
his
way
in
three
days
he
returned
in
having
found
no
traders
at
the
appointed
spot
the
picard
was
absent
at
the
time
looking
for
game
and
hennepin
was
sitting
under
the
shade
of
his
blanket
which
he
had
stretched
on
forked
sticks
to
protect
him
from
the
sun
when
he
saw
his
adopted
father
approaching
with
a
threatening
look
and
a
in
his
hand
he
attempted
no
violence
however
but
suffered
his
wrath
to
exhale
in
a
severe
scolding
after
which
he
resumed
his
course
up
the
river
with
his
warriors
if
hennepin
as
he
avers
really
expected
a
party
of
traders
at
the
wisconsin
the
course
he
now
took
is
sufficiently
explicable
if
he
did
not
expect
them
his
obvious
course
was
to
rejoin
tonty
on
the
illinois
for
which
he
seems
to
have
had
no
inclination
or
to
return
to
canada
by
way
of
the
wisconsin
an
attempt
which
involved
the
risk
of
starvation
as
the
two
travellers
had
but
ten
charges
of
powder
left
assuming
then
his
hope
of
the
traders
to
have
been
real
he
and
du
gay
resolved
in
the
mean
time
to
join
a
large
body
of
sioux
hunters
who
as
aquipaguetin
had
told
them
were
on
a
stream
which
he
calls
bull
river
now
the
chippeway
entering
the
mississippi
near
lake
pepin
by
so
doing
they
would
gain
a
supply
of
food
and
save
themselves
from
the
danger
of
encountering
parties
of
roving
warriors
sidenote
he
rejoins
the
indians
they
found
this
band
among
whom
was
their
companion
accau
and
followed
them
on
a
grand
hunt
along
the
borders
of
the
mississippi
du
gay
was
separated
for
a
time
from
hennepin
who
was
placed
in
a
canoe
with
a
withered
squaw
more
than
eighty
years
old
in
spite
of
her
age
she
handled
her
paddle
with
great
address
and
used
it
vigorously
as
occasion
required
to
repress
the
gambols
of
three
children
who
to
hennepin
annoyance
occupied
the
middle
of
the
canoe
the
hunt
was
successful
the
sioux
warriors
active
as
deer
chased
the
buffalo
on
foot
with
their
arrows
on
the
plains
behind
the
heights
that
bordered
the
river
while
the
old
men
stood
sentinels
at
the
top
watching
for
the
approach
of
enemies
one
day
an
alarm
was
given
the
warriors
rushed
towards
the
supposed
point
of
danger
but
found
nothing
more
formidable
than
two
squaws
of
their
own
nation
who
brought
strange
news
a
of
sioux
they
said
had
gone
towards
lake
superior
and
had
met
by
the
way
five
spirits
that
is
to
say
five
europeans
hennepin
was
full
of
curiosity
to
learn
who
the
strangers
might
be
and
they
on
their
part
were
said
to
have
shown
great
anxiety
to
know
the
nationality
of
the
three
white
men
who
as
they
were
told
were
on
the
river
the
hunt
was
over
and
the
hunters
with
hennepin
and
his
companion
were
on
their
way
northward
to
their
towns
when
they
met
the
five
spirits
at
some
distance
below
the
falls
of
anthony
they
proved
to
be
daniel

this
bold
and
enterprising
man
stigmatized
by
the
intendant
duchesneau
as
a
leader
of
de
was
a
cousin
of
tonty
born
at
lyons
he
belonged
to
that
caste
of
the
lesser
nobles
whose
name
was
legion
and
whose
admirable
military
qualities
shone
forth
so
conspicuously
in
the
wars
of
louis
xiv
though
his
enterprises
were
independent
of
those
of
la
salle
they
were
at
this
time
carried
on
in
connection
with
count
frontenac
and
certain
merchants
in
his
interest
of
whom
du
uncle
patron
was
one
while
louvigny
his
was
in
alliance
with
the
governor
and
was
an
officer
of
his
guard

then
was
a
kind
of
family
league
countenanced
by
frontenac
and
acting
conjointly
with
him
in
order
if
the
angry
letters
of
the
intendant
are
to
be
believed
to
reap
a
clandestine
profit
under
the
shadow
of
the
governor
authority
and
in
violation
of
the
royal
ordinances
the
rudest
part
of
the
work
fell
to
the
share
of
du
lhut
who
with
a
persistent
hardihood
not
surpassed
perhaps
even
by
la
salle
was
continually
in
the
forest
in
the
indian
towns
or
in
remote
wilderness
outposts
planted
by
himself
exploring
trading
fighting
ruling
lawless
savages
and
whites
scarcely
less
ungovernable
and
on
one
or
more
occasions
varying
his
life
by
crossing
the
ocean
to
gain
interviews
with
the
colonial
minister
seignelay
amid
the
splendid
vanities
of
versailles
strange
to
say
this
man
of
hardy
enterprise
was
a
martyr
to
the
gout
which
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
grievously
tormented
him
though
for
a
time
he
thought
himself
cured
by
the
intercession
of
the
iroquois
saint
catharine
tegahkouita
to
whom
he
had
made
a
vow
to
that
end
he
was
without
doubt
an
habitual
breaker
of
the
royal
ordinances
regulating
the
yet
his
services
were
great
to
the
colony
and
to
the
crown
and
his
name
deserves
a
place
of
honor
among
the
pioneers
of
american
civilization
when
hennepin
met
him
he
had
been
about
two
years
in
the
wilderness
in
september
he
left
quebec
for
the
purpose
of
exploring
the
region
of
the
upper
mississippi
and
establishing
relations
of
friendship
with
the
sioux
and
their
kindred
the
assiniboins
in
the
summer
of
he
visited
three
large
towns
of
the
eastern
division
of
the
sioux
including
those
visited
by
hennepin
in
the
following
year
and
planted
the
king
arms
in
all
of
them
early
in
the
autumn
he
was
at
the
head
of
lake
superior
holding
a
council
with
the
assiniboins
and
the
lake
tribes
and
inducing
them
to
live
at
peace
with
the
sioux
in
all
this
he
acted
in
a
public
capacity
under
the
authority
of
the
governor
but
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
he
forgot
his
own
interests
or
those
of
his
associates
the
intendant
angrily
complains
that
he
aided
and
abetted
the
de
in
their
lawless
courses
and
sent
down
in
their
canoes
great
quantities
of
consigned
to
the
merchants
in
league
with
him
under
cover
of
whose
names
the
governor
reaped
his
share
of
the
profits
in
june
while
hennepin
was
in
the
sioux
villages
du
lhut
set
out
from
the
head
of
lake
superior
with
two
canoes
four
frenchmen
and
an
indian
to
continue
his
explorations
he
ascended
a
river
apparently
the
burnt
wood
and
reached
from
thence
a
branch
of
the
mississippi
which
seems
to
have
been
the
croix
it
was
now
that
to
his
surprise
he
learned
that
there
were
three
europeans
on
the
main
river
below
and
fearing
that
they
might
be
englishmen
or
spaniards
encroaching
on
the
territories
of
the
king
he
eagerly
pressed
forward
to
solve
his
doubts
when
he
saw
hennepin
his
mind
was
set
at
rest
and
the
travellers
met
with
mutual
cordiality
they
followed
the
indians
to
their
villages
of
mille
lac
where
hennepin
had
now
no
reason
to
complain
of
their
treatment
of
him
the
sioux
gave
him
and
du
lhut
a
grand
feast
of
honor
at
which
were
seated
a
hundred
and
twenty
naked
guests
and
the
great
chief
ouasicoudé
with
his
own
hands
placed
before
hennepin
a
bark
dish
containing
a
mess
of
smoked
meat
and
wild
rice
autumn
had
come
and
the
travellers
bethought
them
of
going
home
the
sioux
consoled
by
their
promises
to
return
with
goods
for
trade
did
not
oppose
their
departure
and
they
set
out
together
eight
white
men
in
all
as
they
passed
anthony
falls
two
of
the
men
stole
two
which
were
hung
on
trees
as
offerings
to
the
spirit
of
the
cataract
when
du
lhut
heard
of
it
he
was
very
angry
telling
the
men
that
they
had
endangered
the
lives
of
the
whole
party
hennepin
admitted
that
in
the
view
of
human
prudence
he
was
right
but
urged
that
the
act
was
good
and
praiseworthy
inasmuch
as
the
offerings
were
made
to
a
false
god
while
the
men
on
their
part
proved
mutinous
declaring
that
they
wanted
the
robes
and
meant
to
keep
them
the
travellers
continued
their
journey
in
great
but
were
presently
soothed
by
the
excellent
hunting
which
they
found
on
the
way
as
they
approached
the
wisconsin
they
stopped
to
dry
the
meat
of
the
buffalo
they
had
killed
when
to
their
amazement
they
saw
a
of
sioux
approaching
in
a
fleet
of
canoes
hennepin
represents
himself
as
showing
on
this
occasion
an
extraordinary
courage
going
to
meet
the
indians
with
a
and
instructing
du
lhut
who
knew
more
of
these
matters
than
he
how
he
ought
to
behave
the
sioux
proved
not
unfriendly
and
said
nothing
of
the
theft
of
the
they
soon
went
on
their
way
to
attack
the
illinois
and
missouris
leaving
the
frenchmen
to
ascend
the
wisconsin
unmolested
sidenote
the
return
after
various
adventures
they
reached
the
station
of
the
jesuits
at
green
bay
but
its
existence
is
wholly
ignored
by
hennepin
whose
zeal
for
his
own
order
will
not
permit
him
to
allude
to
this
establishment
of
the
rival
missionaries
he
is
equally
reticent
with
regard
to
the
jesuit
mission
at
michilimackinac
where
the
party
soon
after
arrived
and
where
they
spent
the
winter
the
only
intimation
which
he
gives
of
its
existence
consists
in
the
mention
of
the
jesuit
pierson
who
was
a
fleming
like
himself
and
who
often
skated
with
him
on
the
frozen
lake
or
kept
him
company
in
fishing
through
a
hole
in
the
ice
when
the
spring
opened
hennepin
descended
lake
huron
followed
the
detroit
to
lake
erie
and
proceeded
thence
to
niagara
here
he
spent
some
time
in
making
a
fresh
examination
of
the
cataract
and
then
resumed
his
voyage
on
lake
ontario
he
stopped
however
at
the
great
town
of
the
senecas
near
the
genesee
where
with
his
usual
spirit
of
meddling
he
took
upon
him
the
functions
of
the
civil
and
military
authorities
convoked
the
chiefs
to
a
council
and
urged
them
to
set
at
liberty
certain
ottawa
prisoners
whom
they
had
captured
in
violation
of
treaties
having
settled
this
affair
to
his
satisfaction
he
went
to
fort
frontenac
where
his
brother
missionary
buisset
received
him
with
a
welcome
rendered
the
warmer
by
a
story
which
had
reached
him
that
the
indians
had
hanged
hennepin
with
his
own
cord
of
francis
from
fort
frontenac
he
went
to
montreal
and
leaving
his
two
men
on
a
neighboring
island
that
they
might
escape
the
payment
of
duties
on
a
quantity
of
furs
which
they
had
with
them
he
paddled
alone
towards
the
town
count
frontenac
chanced
to
be
here
and
looking
from
the
window
of
a
house
near
the
river
he
saw
approaching
in
a
canoe
a
récollet
father
whose
appearance
indicated
the
extremity
of
hard
service
for
his
face
was
worn
and
sunburnt
and
his
tattered
habit
of
francis
was
abundantly
patched
with
scraps
of
when
at
length
he
recognized
the
hennepin
he
received
him
as
the
father
writes
with
all
the
tenderness
which
a
missionary
could
expect
from
a
person
of
his
rank
and
quality
he
kept
him
for
twelve
days
in
his
own
house
and
listened
with
interest
to
such
of
his
adventures
as
the
friar
saw
fit
to
divulge

farewell
to

my
life
that

might
make
known
my
great
discoveries
to
the
world
he
soon
after
went
to
europe
where
the
story
of
his
travels
found
a
host
of
readers
but
where
he
died
at
last
in
a
deserved
obscurity

call
themselves

great
divisions

subdivided
into
bands

as

the

puts
him
in

in

surrounded

his

the

he
recounts
the
capture

execution
of
the
murderers

his
conduct
on

part

already

made

orders
the

him
should
he

and

this
seems
to
have
been
in
consequence
of
his
renouncing
the
service
of
the
french
crown
and
dedicating
his
edition
of

becomes
grand
la
meeting
with
departure
in
tracing
the
adventures
of
tonty
and
the
rovings
of
hennepin
we
have
lost
sight
of
la
salle
the
pivot
of
the
enterprise
returning
from
the
desolation
and
horror
in
the
valley
of
the
illinois
he
had
spent
the
winter
at
fort
miami
on
the
joseph
by
the
borders
of
lake
michigan
here
he
might
have
brooded
on
the
redoubled
ruin
that
had
befallen
him
the
desponding
friends
the
exulting
foes
the
wasted
energies
the
crushing
load
of
debt
the
stormy
past
the
black
and
lowering
future
but
his
mind
was
of
a
different
temper
he
had
no
thought
but
to
grapple
with
adversity
and
out
of
the
fragments
of
his
ruin
to
build
up
the
fabric
of
success
he
would
not
recoil
but
he
modified
his
plans
to
meet
the
new
contingency
his
white
enemies
had
found
or
rather
perhaps
had
made
a
savage
ally
in
the
iroquois
their
incursions
must
be
stopped
or
his
enterprise
would
come
to
nought
and
he
thought
he
saw
the
means
by
which
this
new
danger
could
be
converted
into
a
source
of
strength
the
tribes
of
the
west
threatened
by
the
common
enemy
might
be
taught
to
forget
their
mutual
animosities
and
join
in
a
defensive
league
with
la
salle
at
its
head
they
might
be
colonized
around
his
fort
in
the
valley
of
the
illinois
where
in
the
shadow
of
the
french
flag
and
with
the
aid
of
french
allies
they
could
hold
the
iroquois
in
check
and
acquire
in
some
measure
the
arts
of
a
settled
life
the
franciscan
friars
could
teach
them
the
faith
and
la
salle
and
his
associates
could
supply
them
with
goods
in
exchange
for
the
vast
harvest
of
furs
which
their
hunters
could
gather
in
these
boundless
wilds
meanwhile
he
would
seek
out
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
and
the
furs
gathered
at
his
colony
in
the
illinois
would
then
find
a
ready
passage
to
the
markets
of
the
world
thus
might
this
ancient
of
warring
savages
be
redeemed
to
civilization
and
christianity
and
a
stable
settlement
grow
up
in
the
heart
of
the
western
wilderness
this
plan
was
but
a
part
of
the
original
scheme
of
his
enterprise
adapted
to
new
and
unexpected
circumstances
and
he
now
set
himself
to
its
execution
with
his
usual
vigor
joined
to
an
address
which
when
dealing
with
indians
never
failed
him
sidenote

there
were

close
at
hand
near

were
the
huts
of
or
thirty
savages
exiles
from
their
homes
and
strangers
in
this
western
world
several
of
the
english
colonies
from
virginia
to
maine
had
of
late
years
been
harassed
by
indian
wars
and
the
puritans
of
new
england
above
all
had
been
scourged
by
the
deadly
outbreak
of
king
philip
war
those
engaged
in
it
had
paid
a
bitter
price
for
their
brief
triumphs
a
band
of
refugees
chiefly
abenakis
and
mohegans
driven
from
their
native
seats
had
roamed
into
these
distant
wilds
and
were
wintering
in
the
friendly
neighborhood
of
the
french
la
salle
soon
won
them
over
to
his
interests
one
of
their
number
was
the
mohegan
hunter
who
for
two
years
had
faithfully
followed
his
fortunes
and
who
had
been
four
years
in
the
west
he
is
described
as
a
prudent
and
discreet
young
man
in
whom
la
salle
had
great
confidence
and
who
could
make
himself
understood
in
several
western
languages
belonging
like
his
own
to
the
great
algonquin
tongue
this
devoted
henchman
proved
an
efficient
mediator
with
his
countrymen
the
indians
with
one
voice
promised
to
follow
la
salle
asking
no
recompense
but
to
call
him
their
chief
and
yield
to
him
the
love
and
admiration
which
he
rarely
failed
to
command
from
this
race
new
allies
soon
appeared
a
shawanoe
chief
from
the
valley
of
the
ohio
whose
following
embraced
a
hundred
and
fifty
warriors
came
to
ask
the
protection
of
the
french
against
the
iroquois
the
shawanoes
are
too
distant
was
la
salle
reply
but
let
them
come
to
me
at
the
illinois
and
they
shall
be
safe
the
chief
promised
to
join
him
in
the
autumn
at
fort
miami
with
all
his
band
but
more
important
than
all
the
consent
and
of
the
illinois
must
be
gained
and
the
miamis
their
neighbors
and
of
late
their
enemies
must
be
taught
the
folly
of
their
league
with
the
iroquois
and
the
necessity
of
joining
in
the
new
confederation
of
late
they
had
been
made
to
see
the
perfidy
of
their
dangerous
allies
a
band
of
the
iroquois
returning
from
the
slaughter
of
the
tamaroa
illinois
had
met
and
murdered
a
band
of
miamis
on
the
ohio
and
had
not
only
refused
satisfaction
but
had
intrenched
themselves
in
three
rude
forts
of
trees
and
brushwood
in
the
heart
of
the
miami
country
the
moment
was
favorable
for
negotiating
but
first
la
salle
wished
to
open
a
communication
with
the
illinois
some
of
whom
had
begun
to
return
to
the
country
they
had
abandoned
with
this
view
and
also
it
seems
to
procure
provisions
he
set
out
on
the
first
of

with
his
lieutenant
la
forest
and
fifteen
men
the
country
was
sheeted
in
snow
and
the
party
journeyed
on
but
when
they
reached
the
open
prairies
the
white
expanse
glared
in
the
sun
with
so
dazzling
a
brightness
that
la
salle
and
several
of
the
men
became
they
stopped
and
encamped
under
the
edge
of
a
forest
and
here
la
salle
remained
in
darkness
for
three
days
suffering
extreme
pain
meanwhile
he
sent
forward
la
forest
and
most
of
the
men
keeping
with
him
his
old
attendant
hunaut
going
out
in
quest
of
a
decoction
of
which
was
supposed
to
be
useful
in
cases
of
this
man
discovered
the
fresh
tracks
of
indians
followed
them
and
found
a
camp
of
outagamies
or
foxes
from
the
neighborhood
of
green
bay
from
them
he
heard
welcome
news
they
told
him
that
tonty
was
safe
among
the
pottawattamies
and
that
hennepin
had
passed
through
their
country
on
his
return
from
among
the
sioux
sidenote
illinois
allies
a
thaw
took
place
the
snow
melted
rapidly
the
rivers
were
opened
the
blind
men
began
to
recover
and
launching
the
canoes
which
they
had
dragged
after
them
the
party
pursued
their
way
by
water
they
soon
met
a
band
of
illinois
la
salle
gave
them
presents
condoled
with
them
on
their
losses
and
urged
them
to
make
peace
and
alliance
with
the
miamis
thus
he
said
they
could
set
the
iroquois
at
defiance
for
he
himself
with
his
frenchmen
and
his
indian
friends
would
make
his
abode
among
them
supply
them
with
goods
and
aid
them
to
defend
themselves
they
listened
well
pleased
promised
to
carry
his
message
to
their
countrymen
and
furnished
him
with
a
large
supply
of
corn
meanwhile
he
had
rejoined
la
forest
whom
he
now
sent
to
michilimackinac
to
await
tonty
and
tell
him
to
remain
there
till
he
la
salle
should
arrive
having
thus
accomplished
the
objects
of
his
journey
he
returned
to
fort
miami
whence
he
soon
after
ascended
the
joseph
to
the
village
of
the
miami
indians
on
the
portage
at
the
head
of
the
kankakee
here
he
found
unwelcome
guests
these
were
three
iroquois
warriors
who
had
been
for
some
time
in
the
place
and
who
as
he
was
told
had
demeaned
themselves
with
the
insolence
of
conquerors
and
spoken
of
the
french
with
the
utmost
contempt
he
hastened
to
confront
them
rebuked
and
menaced
them
and
told
them
that
now
when
he
was
present
they
dared
not
repeat
the
calumnies
which
they
had
uttered
in
his
absence
they
stood
abashed
and
confounded
and
during
the
following
night
secretly
left
the
town
and
fled
the
effect
was
prodigious
on
the
minds
of
the
miamis
when
they
saw
that
la
salle
backed
by
ten
frenchmen
could
command
from
their
arrogant
visitors
a
respect
which
they
with
their
hundreds
of
warriors
had
wholly
failed
to
inspire
here
at
the
outset
was
an
augury
full
of
promise
for
the
approaching
negotiations
there
were
other
strangers
in
the
town
a
band
of
eastern
indians
more
numerous
than
those
who
had
wintered
at
the
fort
the
greater
number
were
from
rhode
island
including
probably
some
of
king
warriors
others
were
from
new
york
and
others
again
from
virginia
la
salle
called
them
to
a
council
promised
them
a
new
home
in
the
west
under
the
protection
of
the
great
king
with
rich
lands
an
abundance
of
game
and
french
traders
to
supply
them
with
the
goods
which
they
had
once
received
from
the
english
let
them
but
help
him
to
make
peace
between
the
miamis
and
the
illinois
and
he
would
insure
for
them
a
future
of
prosperity
and
safety
they
listened
with
open
ears
and
promised
their
aid
in
the
work
of
peace
sidenote
grand
council
on
the
next
morning
the
miamis
were
called
to
a
grand
council
it
was
held
in
the
lodge
of
their
chief
from
which
the
mats
were
removed
that
the
crowd
without
might
hear
what
was
said
la
salle
rose
and
harangued
the
concourse
few
men
were
so
skilled
in
the
arts
of
forest
rhetoric
and
diplomacy
after
the
indian
mode
he
was
to
follow
his
chroniclers
the
greatest
orator
in
north
america
he
began
with
a
gift
of
tobacco
to
clear
the
brains
of
his
auditory
next
for
he
had
brought
a
of
presents
to
support
his
eloquence
he
gave
them
cloth
to
cover
their
dead
coats
to
dress
them
hatchets
to
build
a
grand
scaffold
in
their
honor
and
beads
bells
and
trinkets
of
all
sorts
to
decorate
their
relatives
at
a
grand
funeral
feast
all
this
was
mere
metaphor
the
living
while
appropriating
the
gifts
to
their
own
use
were
pleased
at
the
compliment
offered
to
their
dead
and
their
delight
redoubled
as
the
orator
proceeded
one
of
their
great
chiefs
had
lately
been
killed
and
la
salle
after
a
eulogy
of
the
departed
declared
that
he
would
now
raise
him
to
life
again
that
is
that
he
would
assume
his
name
and
give
support
to
his
squaws
and
children
this
flattering
announcement
drew
forth
an
outburst
of
applause
and
when
to
confirm
his
words
his
attendants
placed
before
them
a
huge
pile
of
coats
shirts
and
the
whole
assembly
exploded
in
yelps
of
admiration
now
came
the
climax
of
the
harangue
introduced
by
a
further
present
of
six
guns
he
who
is
my
master
and
the
master
of
all
this
country
is
a
mighty
chief
feared
by
the
whole
world
but
he
loves
peace
and
the
words
of
his
lips
are
for
good
alone
he
is
called
the
king
of
france
and
he
is
the
mightiest
among
the
chiefs
beyond
the
great
water
his
goodness
reaches
even
to
your
dead
and
his
subjects
come
among
you
to
raise
them
up
to
life
but
it
is
his
will
to
preserve
the
life
he
has
given
it
is
his
will
that
you
should
obey
his
laws
and
make
no
war
without
the
leave
of
onontio
who
commands
in
his
name
at
quebec
and
who
loves
all
the
nations
alike
because
such
is
the
will
of
the
great
king
you
ought
then
to
live
at
peace
with
your
neighbors
and
above
all
with
the
illinois
you
have
had
causes
of
quarrel
with
them
but
their
defeat
has
avenged
you
though
they
are
still
strong
they
wish
to
make
peace
with
you
be
content
with
the
glory
of
having
obliged
them
to
ask
for
it
you
have
an
interest
in
preserving
them
since
if
the
iroquois
destroy
them
they
will
next
destroy
you
let
us
all
obey
the
great
king
and
live
together
in
peace
under
his
protection
be
of
my
mind
and
use
these
guns
that
i
have
given
you
not
to
make
war
but
only
to
hunt
and
to
defend
yourselves
sidenote
the
chiefs
reply
so
saying
he
gave
two
belts
of
wampum
to
confirm
his
words
and
the
assembly
dissolved
on
the
following
day
the
chiefs
again
convoked
it
and
made
their
reply
in
form
it
was
all
that
la
salle
could
have
wished
the
illinois
is
our
brother
because
he
is
the
son
of
our
father
the
great
king
we
make
you
the
master
of
our
beaver
and
our
lands
of
our
minds
and
our
bodies
we
can
not
wonder
that
our
brothers
from
the
east
wish
to
live
with
you
we
should
have
wished
so
too
if
we
had
known
what
a
blessing
it
is
to
be
the
children
of
the
great
king
the
rest
of
this
auspicious
day
was
passed
in
feasts
and
dances
in
which
la
salle
and
his
frenchmen
all
bore
part
his
new
scheme
was
hopefully
begun
it
remained
to
achieve
the
enterprise
twice
defeated
of
the
discovery
of
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
that
vital
condition
of
his
triumph
without
which
all
other
success
was
meaningless
and
vain
to
this
end
he
must
return
to
canada
appease
his
creditors
and
collect
his
scattered
resources
towards
the
end
of
may
he
set
out
in
canoes
from
fort
miami
and
reached
michilimackinac
after
a
prosperous
voyage
here
to
his
great
joy
he
found
tonty
and
zenobe
membré
who
had
lately
arrived
from
green
bay
the
meeting
was
one
at
which
even
his
stoic
nature
must
have
melted
each
had
for
the
other
a
tale
of
disaster
but
when
la
salle
recounted
the
long
succession
of
his
reverses
it
was
with
the
tranquil
tone
and
cheerful
look
of
one
who
relates
the
incidents
of
an
ordinary
journey
membré
looked
on
him
with
admiration
any
one
else
he
says
would
have
thrown
up
his
hand
and
abandoned
the
enterprise
but
far
from
this
with
a
firmness
and
constancy
that
never
had
its
equal
i
saw
him
more
resolved
than
ever
to
continue
his
work
and
push
forward
his
discovery
without
loss
of
time
they
embarked
together
for
fort
frontenac
paddled
their
canoes
a
thousand
miles
and
safely
reached
their
destination
here
in
this
third
beginning
of
his
enterprise
la
salle
found
himself
beset
with
embarrassments
not
only
was
he
burdened
with
the
fruitless
costs
of
his
two
former
efforts
but
the
heavy
debts
which
he
had
incurred
in
building
and
maintaining
fort
frontenac
had
not
been
wholly
paid
the
fort
and
the
seigniory
were
already
deeply
mortgaged
yet
through
the
influence
of
count
frontenac
the
assistance
of
his
secretary
barrois
a
consummate
man
of
business
and
the
support
of
a
wealthy
relative
he
found
means
to
appease
his
creditors
and
even
to
gain
fresh
advances
to
this
end
however
he
was
forced
to
part
with
a
portion
of
his
monopolies
having
first
made
his
will
at
montreal
in
favor
of
a
cousin
who
had
befriended
him
he
mustered
his
men
and
once
more
set
forth
resolved
to
trust
no
more
to
agents
but
to
lead
on
his
followers
in
a
united
body
under
his
own
personal
command
sidenote
the
toronto
portage
at
the
beginning
of
autumn
he
was
at
toronto
where
the
long
and
difficult
portage
to
lake
simcoe
detained
him
a
fortnight
he
spent
a
part
of
it
in
writing
an
account
of
what
had
lately
occurred
to
a
correspondent
in
france
and
he
closes
his
letter
thus
this
is
all
i
can
tell
you
this
year
i
have
a
hundred
things
to
write
but
you
could
not
believe
how
hard
it
is
to
do
it
among
indians
the
canoes
and
their
lading
must
be
got
over
the
portage
and
i
must
speak
to
them
continually
and
bear
all
their
importunity
or
else
they
will
do
nothing
i
want
i
hope
to
write
more
at
leisure
next
year
and
tell
you
the

i

will
turn
out
well

they
reached

bitter
experience
had
taught
him
the
difficulty
of
the
attempt
and
he
resolved
to
trust
to
his
canoes
alone
they
embarked
again
floating
prosperously
down
between
the
leafless
forests
that
flanked
the
tranquil
river

sixth
of

they
issued
upon

lagged
behind

within
a

all
had
arrived
the
navigation
was

they
resumed
their
course
towards
evening
they
saw
on

right
the
mouth
of
a
great
river

invaded

in
pursuit

the

left
him
with
a

others
in
charge

it
again
they
embarked
and
with
every
stage
of
their
adventurous
progress
the
mystery
of
this
vast
new
world
was
more
and
more
unveiled
more
and
more
they
entered
the
realms

the
hazy
sunlight
the
warm
and
drowsy
air
the
tender
foliage
the
opening
flowers
betokened
the
reviving
life
of
nature
for
several
days
more
they
followed
the
writhings
of
the
great
river
on
its
tortuous
course
through
wastes
of
swamp
and
till
on
the
thirteenth
of
march
they
found
themselves
wrapped
in
a
thick
fog
neither
shore
was
visible
but
they
heard
on
the
right
the
booming
of
an
indian
drum
and
the
shrill
outcries
of
the
la
salle
at
once
crossed
to
the
opposite
side
where
in
less
than
an
hour
his
men
threw
up
a
rude
fort
of
felled
trees
meanwhile
the
fog
cleared
and
from
the
farther
bank
the
astonished
indians
saw
the
strange
visitors
at
their
work
some
of
the
french
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
water
and
beckoned
them
to
come
over
several
of
them
approached
in
a
wooden
canoe
to
within
the
distance
of
a

the

sent
a
frenchman
to
meet
them
he
was
well
received
and
the
friendly
mood
of
the
indians
being
now
apparent
the
whole
party
crossed
the
river
sidenote
the
arkansas
on
landing
they
found
themselves
at
a
town
of
the
kappa
band
of
the
arkansas
a
people
dwelling
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
which
bears
their
name

whole
village

his
superior
came
down
to
the
shore
to
meet
us
except
the
women
who
had
run
off
i
can
not
tell
you
the
civility
and
kindness
we
received
from
these
barbarians
who
brought
us
poles
to
make
huts
supplied
us
with
firewood
during
the
three
days
we
were
among
them
and
took
turns
in
feasting
us
but
my
reverend
father
this
gives
no
idea
of
the
good
qualities
of
these
savages
who
are
gay
civil
and
the
young
men
though
the
most
alert
and
spirited
we
had
seen
are
nevertheless
so
modest
that
not
one
of
them
would
take
the
liberty
to
enter
our
hut
but
all
stood
quietly
at
the
door
they
are
so
well
formed
that
we
were
in
admiration
at
their
beauty
we
did
not
lose
the
value
of
a
pin
while
we
were
among
them
various
were
the
dances
and
ceremonies
with
which
they
entertained
the
strangers
who
on
their
part
responded
with
a
solemnity
which
their
hosts
would
have
liked
less
if
they
had
understood
it
better
la
salle
and
tonty
at
the
head
of
their
followers
marched
to
the
open
area
in
the
midst
of
the
village
here
to
the
admiration
of
the
gazing
crowd
of
warriors
women
and
children
a
cross
was
raised
bearing
the
arms
of

not
he
flatters
himself
without
success
labored
to
expound
by
signs
the
mysteries
of
the
faith
while
la
salle
by
methods
equally
satisfactory
drew
from
the
chief
an
acknowledgement
of
fealty
to
louis
xiv
sidenote
the
taensas
after
touching
at
several
other
towns
of
this
people
the
voyagers
resumed
their
course
guided
by
two
of
the
arkansas
passed
the
sites
since
become
historic
of
vicksburg
and
grand
gulf
and
about
three
hundred
miles
below
the
arkansas
stopped
by
the
edge
of
a
swamp
on
the
western
side
of
the
river
here
as
their
two
guides
told
them
was
the
path
to
the
great
town
of
the
taensas
tonty
and
membré
were
sent
to
visit
it
they
and
their
men
shouldered
their
birch
canoe
through
the
swamp
and
launched
it
on
a
lake
which
had
once
formed
a
portion
of
the
channel
of
the
river
in
two
hours
they
reached
the
town
and
tonty
gazed
at
it
with
astonishment
he
had
seen
nothing
like
it
in
america
large
square
dwellings
built
of
mud
mixed
with
straw
arched
over
with
a
roof
of
canes
and
placed
in
regular
order
around
an
open
area
two
of
them
were
larger
and
better
than
the
rest
one
was
the
lodge
of
the
chief
the
other
was
the
temple
or
house
of
the
sun
they
entered
the
former
and
found
a
single
room
forty
feet
square
where
in
the
dim
light
for
there
was
no
opening
but
the
door
the
chief
sat
awaiting
them
on
a
sort
of
bedstead
three
of
his
wives
at
his
side
while
sixty
old
men
wrapped
in
white
cloaks
woven
of
formed
his
divan
when
he
spoke
his
wives
howled
to
do
him
honor
and
the
assembled
councillors
listened
with
the
reverence
due
to
a
potentate
for
whom
at
his
death
a
hundred
victims
were
to
be
sacrificed
he
received
the
visitors
graciously
and
joyfully
accepted
the
gifts
which
tonty
laid
before
him
this
interview
over
the
frenchmen
repaired
to
the
temple
wherein
were
kept
the
bones
of
the
departed
chiefs
in
construction
it
was
much
like
the
royal
dwelling
over
it
were
rude
wooden
figures
representing
three
eagles
turned
towards
the
east
a
strong
mud
wall
surrounded
it
planted
with
stakes
on
which
were
stuck
the
skulls
of
enemies
sacrificed
to
the
sun
while
before
the
door
was
a
block
of
wood
on
which
lay
a
large
shell
surrounded
with
the
braided
hair
of
the
victims
the
interior
was
rude
as
a
barn
dimly
lighted
from
the
doorway
and
full
of
smoke
there
was
a
structure
in
the
middle
which
membré
thinks
was
a
kind
of
altar
and
before
it
burned
a
perpetual
fire
fed
with
three
logs
laid
end
to
end
and
watched
by
two
old
men
devoted
to
this
sacred
office
there
was
a
mysterious
recess
too
which
the
strangers
were
forbidden
to
explore
but
which
as
tonty
was
told
contained
the
riches
of
the
nation
consisting
of
pearls
from
the
gulf
and
trinkets
obtained
probably
through
other
tribes
from
the
spaniards
and
other
europeans
the
chief
condescended
to
visit
la
salle
at
his
camp
a
favor
which
he
would
by
no
means
have
granted
had
the
visitors
been
indians
a
master
of
ceremonies
and
six
attendants
preceded
him
to
clear
the
path
and
prepare
the
place
of
meeting
when
all
was
ready
he
was
seen
advancing
clothed
in
a
white
robe
and
preceded
by
two
men
bearing
white
fans
while
a
third
displayed
a
disk
of
burnished
copper
doubtless
to
represent
the
sun
his
ancestor
or
as
others
will
have
it
his
elder
brother
his
aspect
was
marvellously
grave
and
he
and
la
salle
met
with
gestures
of
ceremonious
courtesy
the
interview
was
very
friendly
and
the
chief
returned
well
pleased
with
the
gifts
which
his
entertainer
bestowed
on
him
and
which
indeed
had
been
the
principal
motive
of
his
visit
sidenote
the
natchez
on
the
next
morning
as
they
descended
the
river
they
saw
a
wooden
canoe
full
of
indians
and
tonty
gave
chase
he
had
nearly
overtaken
it
when
more
than
a
hundred
men
appeared
suddenly
on
the
shore
with
bows
bent
to
defend
their
countrymen
la
salle
called
out
to
tonty
to
withdraw
he
obeyed
and
the
whole
party
encamped
on
the
opposite
bank
tonty
offered
to
cross
the
river
with
a
and
set
out
accordingly
with
a
small
party
of
men
when
he
landed
the
indians
made
signs
of
friendship
by
joining
their
hands
a
proceeding
by
which
tonty
having
but
one
hand
was
somewhat
embarrassed
but
he
directed
his
men
to
respond
in
his
stead
la
salle
and
membré
now
joined
him
and
went
with
the
indians
to
their
village
three
leagues
distant
here
they
spent
the
night
the
sieur
de
la
salle
writes
membré
whose
very
air
engaging
manners
tact
and
address
attract
love
and
respect
alike
produced
such
an
effect
on
the
hearts
of
these
people
that
they
did
not
know
how
to
treat
us
well
enough
the
indians
of
this
village
were
the
natchez
and
their
chief
was
brother
of
the
great
chief
or
sun
of
the
whole
nation
his
town
was
several
leagues
distant
near
the
site
of
the
city
of
natchez
and
thither
the
french
repaired
to
visit
him
they
saw
what
they
had
already
seen
among
the
taensas
a
religious
and
political
despotism
a
privileged
caste
descended
from
the
sun
a
temple
and
a
sacred
fire
la
salle
planted
a
large
cross
with
the
arms
of
france
attached
in
the
midst
of
the
town
while
the
inhabitants
looked
on
with
a
satisfaction
which
they
would
hardly
have
displayed
had
they
understood
the
meaning
of
the
act
sidenote
hostility
the
french
next
visited
the
coroas
at
their
village
two
leagues
below
and
here
they
found
a
reception
no
less
auspicious
on
the
of
march
as
they
approached
red
river
they
passed
in
the
fog
a
town
of
the
oumas
and
three
days
later
discovered
a
party
of
fishermen
in
wooden
canoes
among
the
canes
along
the
margin
of
the
water
they
fled
at
sight
of
the
frenchmen
la
salle
sent
men
to
reconnoitre
who
as
they
struggled
through
the
marsh
were
greeted
with
a
shower
of
arrows
while
from
the
neighboring
village
of
the
quinipissas
invisible
behind
the
they
heard
the
sound
of
an
indian
drum
and
the
whoops
of
the
mustering
warriors
la
salle
anxious
to
keep
the
peace
with
all
the
tribes
along
the
river
recalled
his
men
and
pursued
his
voyage
a
few
leagues
below
they
saw
a
cluster
of
indian
lodges
on
the
left
bank
apparently
void
of
inhabitants
they
landed
and
found
three
of
them
filled
with
corpses
it
was
a
village
of
the
tangibao
sacked
by
their
enemies
only
a
few
days
before
and
now
they
neared
their
journey

on
the
sixth
of

the
river
divided
itself
into
three
broad
channels
la

followed
that
of
the
west
and
dautray
that
of
the
east
while
tonty
took
the
middle
passage
as
he
drifted
down
the
turbid
current
between
the
low
and
marshy
shores
the
brackish
water
changed
to
brine
and
the
breeze
grew
fresh
with
the
salt
breath
of
the
sea
then
the
broad
bosom
of
the
great
gulf
opened
on
his
sight
tossing
its
restless
billows
limitless
voiceless
lonely
as
when
born
of

without
a

without
a

of

la

in
a

coasted
the
marshy
borders
of

and
then
the
reunited
parties
assembled
on
a
spot
of
dry
ground
a
short
distance
above
the
mouth
of
the

here
a
column
was
made
ready

inscribed
with
the
words

the

were
mustered
under

while
the

indians
and
their
squaws
looked
on
in
wondering
silence
they
chanted

the

existed
in

force
among

combined
with

ideas
and
developed
into
forms
of
which
no

equally
distinct
is
to
be

for

clanship
see
the

in

the

a

of

in

for
the
sake
of

the

declares
that

of

la
salle
had
written
his
name
in
history
but
his
success
was
but
the
prelude
of
a
harder
task
herculean
labors
lay
before
him
if
he
would
realize
the
schemes
with
which
his
brain
was
pregnant
bent
on
accomplishing
them
he
retraced
his
course
and
urged
his
canoes
upward
against
the
muddy
current
the
party
were
famished
they
had
little
to
subsist
on
but
the
flesh
of
alligators
when
they
reached
the
quinipissas
who
had
proved
hostile
on
their
way
down
they
resolved
to
risk
an
interview
with
them
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
food
the
treacherous
savages
dissembled
brought
them
corn
and
on
the
following
night
made
an
attack
upon
them
but
met
with
a
bloody
repulse
the
party
next
revisited
the
coroas
and
found
an
unfavorable
change
in
their
disposition
towards
them
they
feasted
them
indeed
but
during
the
repast
surrounded
them
with
an
overwhelming
force
of
warriors
the
french
however
kept
so
well
on
their
guard
that
their
entertainers
dared
not
make
an
attack
and
suffered
them
to
depart
unmolested
sidenote
illness
of
la
salle
and
now
in
a
career
of
unwonted
success
and
anticipated
triumph
la
salle
was
arrested
by
a
foe
against
which
the
boldest
heart
avails
nothing
as
he
ascended
the
mississippi
he
was
seized
by
a
dangerous
illness
unable
to
proceed
he
sent
forward
tonty
to
michilimackinac
whence
after
despatching
news
of
their
discovery
to

he
was
to
return
to
the

la

himself
lay
helpless
at

which
his
men
had
built
at
the
chickasaw
bluffs
on
their
way
down
father
zenobe
membré
attended
him
and
at
the
end
of
july
he
was
once
more
in
a
condition
to
advance
by
slow
movements
towards
fort
miami
which
he
reached
in
about
a
month
in
september
he
rejoined
tonty
at
michilimackinac
and
in
the
following
month
wrote
to
a
friend
in
france
though
my
discovery
is
made
and
i
have
descended
the
mississippi
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
i
can
not
send
you
this
year
either
an
account
of
my
journey
or
a
map
on
the
way
back
i
was
attacked
by
a
deadly
disease
which
kept
me
in
danger
of
my
life
for
forty
days
and
left
me
so
weak
that
i
could
think
of
nothing
for
four
months
after
i
have
hardly
strength
enough
now
to
write
my
letters
and
the
season
is
so
far
advanced
that
i
can
not
detain
a
single
day
this
canoe
which
i
send
expressly
to
carry
them
if
i
had
not
feared
being
forced
to
winter
on
the
way
i
should
have
tried
to
get
to
quebec
to
meet
the
new
governor
if
it
is
true
that
we
are
to
have
one
but
in
my
present
condition
this
would
be
an
act
of
suicide
on
account
of
the
bad
nourishment
i
should
have
all
winter
in
case
the
snow
and
ice
stopped
me
on
the
way
besides
my
presence
is
absolutely
necessary
in
the
place
to
which
i
am
going
i
pray
you
my
dear
sir
to
give
me
once
more
all
the
help
you
can
i
have
great
enemies
who
have
succeeded
in
all
they
have
undertaken
i
do
not
pretend
to
resist
them
but
only
to
justify
myself
so
that
i
can
pursue
by
sea
the
plans
i
have
begun
here
by
land
this
was
what
he
had
proposed
to
himself
from
the
first
that
is
to
abandon
the
difficult
access
through
canada
beset
with
enemies
and
open
a
way
to
his
western
domain
through
the
gulf
and
the
mississippi
this
was
the
aim
of
all
his
toilsome
explorations
could
he
have
accomplished
his
first
intention
of
building
a
vessel
on
the
illinois
and
descending
in
her
to
the
gulf
he
would
have
been
able
to
defray
in
good
measure
the
costs
of
the
enterprise
by
means
of
the
furs
and
collected
on
the
way
and
carried
in
her
to
france
with
a
fleet
of
canoes
this
was
impossible
and
there
was
nothing
to
offset
the
enormous
outlay
which
he
and
his
associates
had
made
he
meant
as
we
have
seen
to
found
on
the
banks
of
the
illinois
a
colony
of
french
and
indians
to
answer
the
double
purpose
of
a
bulwark
against
the
iroquois
and
a
place
of
storage
for
the
furs
of
all
the
western
tribes
and
he
hoped
in
the
following
year
to
secure
an
outlet
for
this
colony
and
for
all
the
trade
of
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
by
occupying
the
mouth
of
that
river
with
a
fort
and
another
colony
this
too
was
an
essential
part
of
his
original
design
but
for
his
illness
he
would
have
gone
to
france
to
provide
for
its
execution
meanwhile
he
ordered
tonty
to
collect
as
many
men
as
possible
and
begin
the
projected
colony
on
the
banks
of
the
illinois
a
report
soon
after
reached
him
that
those
pests
of
the
wilderness
the
iroquois
were
about
to
renew
their
attacks
on
the
western
tribes
this
would
be
fatal
to
his
plans
and
following
tonty
to
the
illinois
he
rejoined
him
near
the
site
of
the
great
town
sidenote
starved
rock
the
cliff
called
starved
rock
now
pointed
out
to
travellers
as
the
chief
natural
curiosity
of
the
region
rises
steep
on
three
sides
as
a
castle
wall
to
the
height
of
a
hundred
and
feet
above
the
river
in
front
it
overhangs
the
water
that
washes
its
base
its
western
brow
looks
down
on
the
tops
of
the
forest
trees
below
and
on
the
east
lies
a
wide
gorge
or
ravine
choked
with
the
mingled
foliage
of
oaks
walnuts
and
elms
while
in
its
rocky
depths
a
little
brook
creeps
down
to
mingle
with
the
river
from
the
trunk
of
the
stunted
cedar
that
leans
forward
from
the
brink
you
may
drop
a
plummet
into
the
river
below
where
the
and
the
turtles
may
plainly
be
seen
gliding
over
the
wrinkled
sands
of
the
clear
and
shallow
current
the
cliff
is
accessible
only
from
behind
where
a
man
may
climb
up
not
without
difficulty
by
a
steep
and
narrow
passage
the
top
is
about
an
acre
in
extent
here
in
the
month
of
december
la
salle
and
tonty
began
to
intrench
themselves
they
cut
away
the
forest
that
crowned
the
rock
built
and
dwellings
of
its
remains
dragged
timber
up
the
rugged
pathway
and
encircled
the
summit
with
a

thus
the
winter
passed
and
meanwhile
the
work
of
negotiation
went
prosperously
on
the
minds
of
the
indians
had
been
already
prepared
in
la

they
saw
their
champion
against
the
iroquois
the
standing
terror
of
all
this
region
they
gathered
round
his
stronghold
like
the
timorous
peasantry
of
the
middle
ages
around
the
castle
of
their
feudal
lord
from
the
wooden
ramparts
of
louis
for
so
he
named
his
fort
high
and
inaccessible
as
an
eagle
nest
a
strange
scene
lay
before
his
eye
the
broad
flat
valley
of
the
illinois
was
spread
beneath
him
like
a
map
bounded
in
the
distance
by
its
low
wall
of
woody
hills
the
river
wound
at
his
feet
in
devious
channels
among
islands
bordered
with
lofty
trees
then
far
on
the
left
flowed
calmly
westward
through
the
vast
meadows
till
its
glimmering
blue
ribbon
was
lost
in
hazy
distance
there
had
been
a
time
and
that
not
remote
when
these
fair
meadows
were
a
waste
of
death
and
desolation
scathed
with
fire
and
strewn
with
the
ghastly
relics
of
an
iroquois
victory
now
all
was
changed
la
salle
looked
down
from
his
rock
on
a
concourse
of
wild
human
life
lodges
of
bark
and
rushes
or
cabins
of
logs
were
clustered
on
the
open
plain
or
along
the
edges
of
the
bordering
forests
squaws
labored
warriors
lounged
in
the
sun
naked
children
whooped
and
gambolled
on
the
grass
beyond
the
river
a
mile
and
a
half
on
the
left
the
banks
were
studded
once
more
with
the
lodges
of
the
illinois
who
to
the
number
of
six
thousand
had
returned
since
their
defeat
to
this
their
favorite
scattered
along
the
valley
among
the
adjacent
hills
or
over
the
neighboring
prairie
were
the
cantonments
of
a
of
other
tribes
and
fragments
of
tribes
gathered
under
the
protecting
ægis
of
the
french
shawanoes
from
the
ohio
abenakis
from
maine
miamis
from
the
sources
of
the
kankakee
with
others
whose
barbarous
names
are
hardly
worth
the
record
nor
were
these
la

only
dependants
by
the
terms
of
his
patent
he
held
seigniorial
rights
over
this
wild
domain
and
he
now
began
to
grant
it
out
in
parcels
to
his
followers
these
however
were
as
yet
but
a
score
a
lawless
band
trained
in
forest
license
and
marrying
as
their
detractors
affirm
a
new
squaw
every
day
in
the
week
this
was
after
their
lord
departure
for
his

imposed
a
check
on
these
eccentricities

reports
the
total

of
the

around
fort
louis
at
about
four
thousand
warriors
or
twenty
thousand
souls
his
diplomacy
had
been
crowned
with
a
marvellous
success
for
which
his
thanks
were
due
first
to
the
iroquois
and
the
universal
terror
they
inspired
next
to
his
own
address
and
unwearied
energy
his
colony
had
sprung
up
as
it
were
in
a
night
but
might
not
a
night
suffice
to
disperse
it
the
conditions
of
maintaining
it
were
twofold
first
he
must
give
efficient
aid
to
his
savage
colonists
against
the
iroquois
secondly
he
must
supply
them
with
french
goods
in
exchange
for
their
furs
the
men
arms
and
ammunition
for
their
defence
and
the
goods
for
trading
with
them
must
be
brought
from
canada
until
a
better
and
surer
avenue
of
supply
could
be
provided
through
the
entrepôt
which
he
meant
to
establish
at
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
canada
was
full
of
his
enemies
but
as
long
as
count
frontenac
was
in
power
he
was
sure
of
support
count
frontenac
was
in
power
no
longer
he
had
been
recalled
to

through
the
intrigues
of
the
party
adverse
to

and
le

reigned
in

la
barre
was
an
old
naval
officer
of
rank
advanced
to
a
post
for
which
he
proved
himself
notably
unfit
if
he
was
without
the
arbitrary
passions
which
had
been
the
chief
occasion
of
the
recall
of
his
predecessor
he
was
no
less
without
his
energies
and
his
talents
he
showed
a
weakness
and
an
avarice
for
which
his
age
may
have
been
in
some
measure
answerable
he
was
no
whit
less
unscrupulous
than
his
predecessor
in
his
secret
violation
of
the
royal
ordinances
regulating
the
which
it
was
his
duty
to
enforce
like
frontenac
he
took
advantage
of
his
position
to
carry
on
an
illicit
traffic
with
the
indians
but
it
was
with
different
associates
the
late
friends
were
the
new
governor
enemies
and
la

armed
with
his
monopolies
was
the
object
of
his
especial
jealousy
meanwhile
la

buried
in
the
western
wilderness
remained
for
the
time
ignorant
of
la

disposition
towards
him
and
made
an
effort
to
secure
his
and
countenance
he
wrote
to
him
from
his
rock
of
louis
early
in
the
spring
of
expressing
the
hope
that
he
should
have
from
him
the
same
support
as
from
count
frontenac
although
he
says
my
enemies
will
try
to
influence
you
against
me
his
attachment
to
frontenac
he
pursues
has
been
the
cause
of
all
the
late
governor
enemies
turning
against
him
he
then
recounts
his
voyage
down
the
mississippi
says
that
with
frenchmen
he
caused
all
the
tribes
along
the
river
to
ask
for
peace
and
speaks
of
his
right
under
the

patent
to
build

anywhere
along

around
them

losses
in
my
enterprises
he
continues
have
exceeded
forty
thousand
crowns
i
am
now
going
four
hundred
leagues
of
this
place
to
induce
the
chickasaws
to
follow
the
shawanoes
and
other
tribes
and
settle
like
them
at
louis
it
remained
only
to
settle
french
colonists
here
and
this
i
have
already
done
i
hope
you
will
not
detain
them
as
de
when
they
come
down
to
montreal
to
make
necessary
purchases
i
am
aware
that
i
have
no
right
to
trade
with
the
tribes
who
descend
to
montreal
and
i
shall
not
permit
such
trade
to
my
men
nor
have
i
ever
issued
licenses
to
that
effect
as
my
enemies
say
that
i
have
done
again
on
the
fourth
of
june
following
he
writes
to
la
barre
from
the
chicago
portage
complaining
that
some
of
his
colonists
going
to
montreal
for
necessary
supplies
have
been
detained
by
his
enemies
and
begging
that
they
may
be
allowed
to
return
that
his
enterprise
may
not
be
ruined
the
iroquois
he
pursues
are
again
invading
the
country
last
year
the
miamis
were
so
alarmed
by
them
that
they
abandoned
their
town
and
fled
but
at
my
return
they
came
back
and
have
been
induced
to
settle
with
the
illinois
at
my
fort
of
louis
the
iroquois
have
lately
murdered
some
families
of
their
nation
and
they
are
all
in
terror
again
i
am
afraid
they
will
take
flight
and
so
prevent
the
missouris
and
neighboring
tribes
from
coming
to
settle
at
louis
as
they
are
about
to
do
some
of
the
hurons
and
french
tell
the
miamis
that
i
am
keeping
them
here
for
the
iroquois
to
destroy
i
pray
that
you
will
let
me
hear
from
you
that
i
may
give
these
people
some
assurances
of
protection
before
they
are
destroyed
in
my
sight
do
not
suffer
my
men
who
have
come
down
to
the
settlements
to
be
longer
prevented
from
returning
there
is
great
need
here
of
reinforcements
the
iroquois
as
i
have
said
have
lately
entered
the
country
and
a
great
terror
prevails
i
have
postponed
going
to
michilimackinac
because
if
the
iroquois
strike
any
blow
in
my
absence
the
miamis
will
think
that
i
am
in
league
with
them
whereas
if
i
and
the
french
stay
among
them
they
will
regard
us
as
protectors
but
monsieur
it
is
in
vain
that
we
risk
our
lives
here
and
that
i
exhaust
my
means
in
order
to
fulfil
the
intentions
of
his
majesty
if
all
my
measures
are
crossed
in
the
settlements
below
and
if
those
who
go
down
to
bring
munitions
without
which
we
can
not
defend
ourselves
are
detained
under
pretexts
trumped
up
for
the
occasion
if
i
am
prevented
from
bringing
up
men
and
supplies
as
i
am
allowed
to
do
by
the
permit
of
count
frontenac
then
my
patent
from
the
king
is
useless
it
would
be
very
hard
for
us
after
having
done
what
was
required
even
before
the
time
prescribed
and
after
suffering
severe
losses
to
have
our
efforts
frustrated
by
obstacles
got
up
designedly
i
trust
that
as
it
lies
with
you
alone
to
prevent
or
to
permit
the
return
of
the
men
whom
i
have
sent
down
you
will
not
so
act
as
to
thwart
my
plans
a
part
of
the
goods
which
i
have
sent
by
them
belong
not
to
me
but
to
the
sieur
de
tonty
and
are
a
part
of
his
pay
others
are
to
buy
munitions
indispensable
for
our
defence
do
not
let
my
creditors
seize
them
it
is
for
their
advantage
that
my
fort
full
as
it
is
of
goods
should
be
held
against
the
enemy
i
have
only
twenty
men
with
scarcely
a
hundred
pounds
of
powder
and
i
can
not
long
hold
the
country
without
more
the
illinois
are
very
capricious
and
uncertain
if
i
had
men
enough
to
send
out
to
reconnoitre
the
enemy
i
would
have
done
so
before
this
but
i
have
not
enough
i
trust
you
will
put
it
in
my
power
to
obtain
more
that
this
important
colony
may
be
saved
while
la
salle
was
thus
writing
to
la
barre
la
barre
was
writing
to
seignelay
the
marine
and
colonial
minister
decrying
his
correspondent
discoveries
and
pretending
to
doubt
their
reality
the
iroquois
he
adds
have
sworn
his
la
salle
death
the
imprudence
of
this
man
is
about
to
involve
the
colony
in
war
and
again
he
writes
in
the
following
spring
to
say
that
la
salle
was
with
a
score
of
vagabonds
at
green
bay
where
he
set
himself
up
as
a
king
pillaged
his
countrymen
and
put
them
to
ransom
exposed
the
tribes
of
the
west
to
the
incursions
of
the
iroquois
and
all
under
pretence
of
a
patent
from
his
majesty
the
provisions
of
which
he
grossly
abused
but
as
his
privileges
would
expire
on
the
twelfth
of
may
ensuing
he
would
then
be
forced
to
come
to
quebec
where
his
creditors
to
whom
he
owed
more
than
thirty
thousand
crowns
were
anxiously
awaiting
him
finally
when
la
barre
received
the
two
letters
from
la
salle
of
which
the
substance
is
given
above
he
sent
copies
of
them
to
the
minister
seignelay
with
the
following
comment
by
the
copies
of
the
sieur
de
la
salle
letters
you
will
perceive
that
his
head
is
turned
and
that
he
has
been
bold
enough
to
give
you
intelligence
of
a
false
discovery
and
that
instead
of
returning
to
the
colony
to
learn
what
the
king
wishes
him
to
do
he
does
not
come
near
me
but
keeps
in
the
backwoods
five
hundred
leagues
off
with
the
idea
of
attracting
the
inhabitants
to
him
and
building
up
an
imaginary
kingdom
for
himself
by
debauching
all
the
bankrupts
and
idlers
of
this
country
if
you
will
look
at
the
two
letters
i
had
from
him
you
can
judge
the
character
of
this
personage
better
than
i
can
affairs
with
the
iroquois
are
in
such
a
state
that
i
can
not
allow
him
to
muster
all
their
enemies
together
and
put
himself
at
their
head
all
the
men
who
brought
me
news
from
him
have
abandoned
him
and
say
not
a
word
about
returning
sell
the
furs
they
have
brought
as
if
they
were
their
so
that
he
can
not
hold
his
ground
much
longer
such
calumnies
had
their
effect
the
enemies
of
la
salle
had
already
gained
the
ear
of
the
king
and
he
had
written
in
august
from
fontainebleau
to
his
new
governor
of
canada
i
am
convinced
like
you
that
the
discovery
of
the
sieur
de
la
salle
is
very
useless
and
that
such
enterprises
ought
to
be
prevented
in
future
as
they
tend
only
to
debauch
the
inhabitants
by
the
hope
of
gain
and
to
diminish
the
revenue
from
in
order
to
understand
the
posture
of
affairs
at
this
time
it
must
be
remembered
that
dutch
and
english
traders
of
new
york
were
urging
on
the
iroquois
to
attack
the
western
tribes
with
the
object
of
gaining
through
their
conquest
the
control
of
the
of
the
interior
and
diverting
it
from
montreal
to
albany
the
scheme
was
full
of
danger
to
canada
which
the
loss
of
the
trade
would
have
ruined
la
barre
and
his
associates
were
greatly
alarmed
at
it
its
complete
success
would
have
been
fatal
to
their
hopes
of
profit
but
they
nevertheless
wished
it
such
a
measure
of
success
as
would
ruin
their
rival
la
salle
hence
no
little
satisfaction
mingled
with
their
anxiety
when
they
heard
that
the
iroquois
were
again
threatening
to
invade
the
miamis
and
the
illinois
and
thus
la
barre
whose
duty
it
was
strenuously
to
oppose
the
intrigue
of
the
english
and
use
every
effort
to
quiet
the
ferocious
bands
whom
they
were
hounding
against
the
indian
allies
of
the
french
was
in
fact
but
in
the
work
he
cut
off
la
salle
from
all
supplies
detained
the
men
whom
he
sent
for
succor
and
at
a
conference
with
the
iroquois
told
them
that
they
were
welcome
to
plunder
and
kill
him
sidenote
a
new
alarm
the
old
governor
and
the
unscrupulous
ring
with
which
he
was
associated
now
took
a
step
to
which
he
was
doubtless
emboldened
by
the
tone
of
the
king
letter
in
condemnation
of
la
salle
enterprise
he
resolved
to
seize
fort
frontenac
the
property
of
la
salle
under
the
pretext
that
the
latter
had
not
fulfilled
the
conditions
of
the
grant
and
had
not
maintained
a
sufficient
garrison
two
of
his
associates
la
chesnaye
and
le
ber
armed
with
an
order
from
him
went
up
and
took
possession
despite
the
remonstrances
of
la
creditors
and
mortgagees
lived
on
la
salle
stores
sold
for
their
own
profit
and
it
is
said
that
of
la
barre
the
provisions
sent
by
the
king
and
turned
in
the
cattle
to
pasture
on
the
growing
crops
la
forest
la
salle
lieutenant
was
told
that
he
might
retain
the
command
of
the
fort
if
he
would
join
the
associates
but
he
refused
and
sailed
in
the
autumn
for
france
meanwhile
la
salle
remained
at
the
illinois
in
extreme
embarrassment
cut
off
from
supplies
robbed
of
his
men
who
had
gone
to
seek
them
and
disabled
from
fulfilling
the
pledges
he
had
given
to
the
surrounding
indians
such
was
his
position
when
reports
came
to
fort
louis
that
the
iroquois
were
at
hand
the
indian
hamlets
were
wild
with
terror
beseeching
him
for
succor
which
he
had
no
power
to
give
happily
the
report
proved
false
no
iroquois
appeared
the
threatened
attack
was
postponed
and
the
summer
passed
away
in
peace
but
la
salle
position
with
the
governor
his
declared
enemy
was
intolerable
and
untenable
and
there
was
no
resource
but
in
the
protection
of
the
court
early
in
the
autumn
he
left
tonty
in
command
of
the
rock
bade
farewell
to
his
savage
retainers
and
descended
to
quebec
intending
to
sail
for
france
on
his
way
he
met
the
chevalier
de
baugis
an
officer
of
the
dragoons
commissioned
by
la
barre
to
take
possession
of
fort
louis
and
bearing
letters
from
the
governor
ordering
la
salle
to
come
to
quebec
a
superfluous
command
as
he
was
then
on
his
way
thither
he
smothered
his
wrath
and
wrote
to
tonty
to
receive
de
baugis
well
the
chevalier
and
his
party
proceeded
to
the
illinois
and
took
possession
of
the
fort
de
baugis
commanding
for
the
governor
while
tonty
remained
as
representative
of
la
salle
the
two
officers
could
not
live
in
harmony
but
with
the
return
of
spring
each
found
himself
in
sore
need
of
aid
from
the
other
towards
the
end
of
march
the
iroquois
attacked
their
citadel
and
besieged
it
for
six
days
but
at
length
withdrew
discomfited
carrying
with
them
a
number
of
indian
prisoners
most
of
whom
escaped
from
their
clutches

answers
in

respect
to
the
indications
of
the
contemporary
maps
and
documents
concerning

the
site
of

fort

it
is
laid
down
on
several
contemporary
maps
besides
the
great
map
of

made
in
they
all
place
it
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
whereas
buffalo
rock
three
miles
above
which
has
been
supposed
to
be
the
site
of
the
fort
is
on
the
north
the
latter
is
crowned
by
a
plateau
of
great
extent
is
but
sixty
feet
high
is
accessible
at
many
points
and
would
require
a
large
force
to
defend
it
whereas
la
salle
chose
le
rocher
because
a
few
men
could
hold
it
against
a
multitude
charlevoix
in
describes
both
rocks
and
says
that
the
top
of
buffalo
rock
had
been
occupied
by
the
miami
village
so
that
it
was
known
as
fort
des
this
is
confirmed
by
joutel
who
found
the
miamis
here
in
charlevoix
then
speaks
of
le
rocher
calling
it
by
that
name
says
that
it
is
about
a
league
below
on
the
left
or
south
side
forming
a
sheer
cliff
very
high
and
looking
like
a
fortress
on
the
border
of
the
river
he
saw
remains
of
palisades
at
the
top
which
he
thinks
were
made
by
the
illinois
historique
xxvii
though
his
countrymen
had
occupied
it
only
three
years
before
the
french
reside
on
the
rock
le
rocher
which
is
very
lofty
and
impregnable
on
western
ix
cosme
passing
this
way
in
mentions
it
as
le
vieux
fort
and
says
that
it
is
a
rock
about
a
hundred
feet
high
at
the
edge
of
the
river
where
de
la
salle
built
a
fort
since
abandoned
de
joutel
who
was
here
in
says
fort
louis
is
on
a
steep
rock
about
two
hundred
feet
high
with
the
river
running
at
its
base
he
adds
that
its
only
defences
were
palisades
the
true
height
as
stated
above
is
about
a
hundred
and
feet
a
traditional
interest
also
attaches
to
this
rock
it
is
said
that
in
the
indian
wars
that
followed
the
assassination
of
pontiac
a
few
years
after
the
cession
of
canada
a
party
of
illinois
assailed
by
the
pottawattamies
here
took
refuge
defying
attack
at
length
they
were
all
destroyed
by
starvation
and
hence
the
name
of
starved
rock
for
other
proofs
concerning
this
locality
see
this
singular
extemporized
colony
of

laid
down
in
detail
on
the

by

in

can
be
no
doubt
that
this
part
of
the

is
composed
from
authentic
data
la

himself
besides
others
of
his

came
down
from

in

undoubtedly
supplied

as
already

yearly
ploughed
up
the

village
is
placed
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
behind
the
fort
the
country
is
here
hilly
broken
and
now
as
in
la
salle
time
covered
with
wood
which
however
soon
ends
in
the
open
prairie
a
short
time
since
the
remains
of
a
low
irregular
earthwork
of
considerable
extent
were
discovered
at
the
intersection
of
two
ravines
about
hundred
feet
behind
or
south
of
starved
rock
the
earthwork
follows
the
line
of
the
ravines
on
two
sides
on
the
east
there
is
an
opening
or
gateway
leading
to
the
adjacent
prairie
the
work
is
very
irregular
in
form
and
shows
no
trace
of
the
civilized
engineer

the
stump
of

neighboring

must
also
express
my
obligations
to
bowman
photographer
at
ottawa
for
views
of
starved
rock
and
other
features
of
the
neighboring
scenery
an
interesting
relic
of
the
early
explorers
of
this
region
was
found
a
few
years
ago
at
ottawa
six
miles
above
starved
rock
in
the
shape
of
a
small
iron
gun
buried
several
feet
deep
in
the
drift
of
the
river
it
consists
of
a
welded
tube
of
iron
about
an
inch
and
a
half
in
calibre
strengthened
by
a
series
of
thick
iron
rings
cooled
on
after
the
most
ancient
as
well
as
the
most
recent
method
of
making
cannon
it
is
about
fourteen
inches
long
the
part
near
the
muzzle
having
been
burst
off
the
construction
is
very
rude
small
on
a
similar
principle
were
used
in
the
fourteenth
century
several
of
them
may
be
seen
at
the
musée
at
paris
in
the
time
of
louis
the
art
of
casting
cannon
was
carried
to
a
high
degree
of
perfection
the
gun
in
question
may
have
been
made
by
a
french
blacksmith
on
the
spot
a
far
less
probable
supposition
is
that
it
is
a
relic
of
some
unrecorded
visit
of
the
spaniards
but
the
pattern
of
the
piece
would
have
been
antiquated
even
in
the
time
of
de
soto
the
royal
instructions
to
la
barre
on
his
assuming
the
government
dated
at
versailles
may
require
him
to
give
no
further
permission
to
make
journeys
of
discovery
towards
the
sioux
and
the
mississippi
as
his
majesty
thinks
his
subjects
better
employed
in
cultivating

the

adds
however
that
la

is
to
be
allowed
to
continue
his
discoveries
if
they
appear
to
be

by

strength
and

contrasts
of
his
character
we
have
seen
la

in
his
acts
while
he
crosses
the
sea
let
us
look
at
him
in
himself
few
men
knew
him
even
of
those
who
saw
him
most
reserved
and
as
he
was
with
little
vivacity
or
gayety
or
love
of
pleasure
he
was
a
sealed
book
to
those
about
him
his
daring
energy
and
endurance
were
patent
to
all
but
the
motive
forces
that
urged
him
and
the
influences
that
wrought
beneath
the
surface
of
his
character
were
hidden
where
few
eyes
could
pierce
his
enemies
were
free
to
make
their
own
interpretations
and
they
did
not
fail
to
use
the
opportunity
the
interests
arrayed
against
him
were
incessantly
at
work
his
men
were
persuaded
to
desert
and
rob
him
the
iroquois
were
told
that
he
was
arming
the
western
tribes
against
them
the
western
tribes
were
told
that
he
was
betraying
them
to
the
iroquois
his
proceedings
were
denounced
to
the
court
and
continual
efforts
were
made
to
alienate
his
associates
they
on
their
part
sore
as
they
were
from
disappointment
and
loss
were
in
a
mood
to
listen
to
the
aspersions
cast
upon
him
and
they
pestered
him
with
letters
asking
questions
demanding
explanations
and
dunning
him
for
money
it
is
through
his
answers
that
we
are
best
able
to
judge
him
and
at
times
by
those
touches
of
nature
which
make
the
whole
world
kin
they
teach
us
to
know
him
and
to
feel
for
him
sidenote
charges
against
la
salle
the
main
charges
against
him
were
that
he
was
a
schemer
that
he
was
harsh
to
his
men
that
he
traded
where
he
had
no
right
to
trade
and
that
his
discoveries
were
nothing
but
a
pretence
for
making
money
no
accusations
appear
that
touch
his
integrity
or
his
honor
it
was
hard
to
convince
those
who
were
always
losing
by
him
a
remittance
of
good
dividends
would
have
been
his
best
answer
and
would
have
made
any
other
answer
needless
but
instead
of
bills
of
exchange
he
had
nothing
to
give
but
excuses
and
explanations
in
the
autumn
of
he
wrote
to
an
associate
who
had
demanded
the
profits
i
have
had
many
misfortunes
in
the
last
two
years
in
the
autumn
of
i
lost
a
vessel
by
the
fault
of
the
pilot
in
the
next
summer

told
you
about

me
of
eight
or
ten
thousand
livres
worth
of
goods
in
the
autumn
of
i
lost
a
vessel
worth
more
than
ten
thousand
crowns
in
the
next
spring
five
or
six
rascals
stole
the
value
of
five
or
six
thousand
livres
in
goods
and
at
the
illinois
when
i
was
absent
two
other
men
of
mine
carrying
furs
worth
four
or
five
thousand
livres
were
killed
or
drowned
in
the
lawrence
and
the
furs
were
lost
another
robbed
me
of
three
thousand
livres
in
stored
at
michilimackinac
this
last
spring
i
lost
about
seventeen
hundred
livres
worth
of
goods
by
the
upsetting
of
a
canoe
last
winter
the
fort
and
buildings
at
niagara
were
burned
by
the
fault
of
the
commander
and
in
the
spring
the
deserters
who
passed
that
way
seized
a
part
of
the
property
that
remained
and
escaped
to
new
york
all
this
does
not
discourage
me
in
the
least
and
will
only
defer
for
a
year
or
two
the
returns
of
profit
which
you
ask
for
this
year
these
losses
are
no
more
my
fault
than
the
loss
of
the
ship
joseph

yours
i
can
not
be
everywhere
and
can
not
help
making

of
the
people
of
the
country
he
begs
his
correspondent
to
send
out
an
agent
of
his
own
he
need
not
be
very
but
he
must
be
faithful
patient
of
labor
and
fond
neither
of
gambling
women
nor
good
cheer
for
he
will
find
none
of
these
with
me
trusting
in
what
he
will
write
you
you
may
close
your
ears
to
what
priests
and
jesuits
tell
you
sidenote
vexations
of
his
position
after
having
put
matters
in
good
trim
for
trade
i
mean
to
withdraw
though
i
think
it
will
be
very
profitable
for
i
am
disgusted
to
find
that
i
must
always
be
making
excuses
which
is
a
part
i
can
not
play
successfully
i
am
utterly
tired
of
this
business
for
i
see
that
it
is
not
enough
to
put
property
and
life
in
constant
peril
but
that
it
requires
more
pains
to
answer
envy
and
detraction
than
to
overcome
the
difficulties
inseparable
from
my
undertaking
and
he
makes
a
variety
of
proposals
by
which
he
hopes
to
get
rid
of
a
part
of
his
responsibility
to
his
correspondent
he
begs
him
again
to
send
out
a
confidential
agent
saying
that
for
his
part
he
does
not
want
to
have
any
account
to
render
except
that
which
he
owes
to
the
court
of
his
discoveries
he
adds
strangely
enough
for
a
man
burdened
with
such
liabilities
i
have
neither
the
habit
nor
the
inclination
to
keep
books
nor
have
i
anybody
with
me
who
knows
how
he
says
to
another
correspondent
i
think
like
you
that
partnerships
in
business
are
dangerous
on
account
of
the
little
practice
i
have
in
these
matters
it
is
not
surprising
that
he
wanted
to
leave
his
associates
to
manage
business
for
themselves
you
know
that
this
trade
is
good
and
with
a
trusty
agent
to
conduct
it
for
you
you
run
no
risk
as
for
me
i
will
keep
the
charge
of
the
forts
the
command
of
posts
and
of
men
the
management
of
indians
and
frenchmen
and
the
establishment
of
the
colony
which
will
remain
my
property
leaving
your
agent
and
mine
to
look
after
our
interests
and
drawing
my
half
without
having
any
hand
in
what
belongs
to
you
la
salle
was
a
very
indifferent
trader
and
his
heart
was
not
in
the
commercial
part
of
his
enterprise
he
aimed
at
achievement
and
thirsted
after
greatness
his
ambition
was
to
found
another
france
in
the
west
and
if
he
meant
to
govern
it
also
as
without
doubt
he
did
it
is
not
a
matter
of
wonder
or
of
blame
his
misfortune
was
that
in
the
pursuit
of
a
great
design
he
was
drawn
into
complications
of
business
with
which
he
was
ill
fitted
to
grapple
he
had
not
the
instinct
of
the
successful
merchant
he
dared
too
much
and
often
dared
unwisely
attempted
more
than
he
could
grasp
and
forgot
in
his
sanguine
anticipations
to
reckon
with
enormous
and
incalculable
risks
except
in
the
narrative
parts
his
letters
are
rambling
and
unconnected
which
is
natural
enough
written
as
they
were
at
odd
moments
by
and
among
indians
the
style
is
crude
and
being
well
aware
of
this
he
disliked
writing
especially
as
the
risk
was
extreme
that
his
letters
would
miss
their
destination
there
is
too
little
good
faith
in
this
country
and
too
many
people
on
the
watch
for
me
to
trust
anybody
with
what
i
wish
to
send
you
even
sealed
letters
are
not
too
safe
not
only
are
they
liable
to
be
lost
or
stopped
by
the
way
but
even
such
as
escape
the
curiosity
of
spies
lie
at
montreal
waiting
a
long
time
to
be
forwarded
sidenote
his
letters
intercepted
again
he
writes
i
can
not
pardon
myself
for
the
stoppage
of
my
letters
though
i
made
every
effort
to
make
them
reach
you
i
wrote
to
you
in
in
august
and
sent
my
letters
to
de
la
forest
who
gave
them
in
good
faith
to
my
brother
i
do
know
what
he
has
done
with
them
i
wrote
you
another
by
the
vessel
that
was
lost
last
year
i
sent
two
canoes
by
two
different
routes
but
the
wind
and
the
rain
were
so
furious
that
they
wintered
on
the
way
and
i
found
my
letters
at
the
fort
on
my
return
i
now
send
you
one
of
them
which
i
wrote
last
year
to
thouret
in
which
you
will
find
a
full
account
of
what
passed
from
the
time
when
we
left
the
outlet
of
lake
erie
down
to
the
sixteenth
of
august
what
preceded
was
told
at
full
length
in
the
letters
my
brother
has
seen
fit
to
intercept
this
brother
was
the
sulpitian
priest
jean
cavelier
who
had
been
persuaded
that
la
salle
enterprise
would
be
ruinous
and
therefore
set
himself
sometimes
to
stop
it
altogether
and
sometimes
to
manage
it
in
his
own
way
his
conduct
towards
me
says
la
salle
has
always
been
so
strange
through
the
small
love
he
bears
me
that
it
was
clear
gain
for
me
when
he
went
away
since
while
he
stayed
he
did
nothing
but
cross
all
my
plans
which
i
was
forced
to
change
every
moment
to
suit
his
caprice
there
was
one
point
on
which
the
interference
of
his
brother
and
of
his
correspondents
was
peculiarly
annoying
they
thought
it
for
their
interest
that
he
should
remain
a
single
man
whereas
it
seems
that
his
devotion
to
his
purpose
was
not
so
engrossing
as
to
exclude
more
tender
subjects
he
writes
i
am
told
that
you
have
been
uneasy
about
my
pretended
marriage
i
had
not
thought
about
it
at
that
time
and
i
shall
not
make
any
engagement
of
the
sort
till
i
have
given
you
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
me
it
is
a
little
extraordinary
that
i
must
render
account
of
a
matter
which
is
free
to
all
the
world
in
fine
monsieur
it
is
only
as
an
earnest
of
something
more
substantial
that
i
write
to
you
so
much
at
length
i
do
not
doubt
that
you
will
hereafter
change
the
ideas
about
me
which
some
persons
wish
to
give
you
and
that
you
will
be
relieved
of
the
anxiety
which
all
that
has
happened
reasonably
causes
you
i
have
written
this
letter
at
more
than
twenty
different
times
and
i
am
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
leagues
from
where
i
began
it
i
have
still
two
hundred
more
to
get
over
before
reaching
the
illinois
i
am
taking
with
me
men
to
the
relief
of
the
six
or
seven
who
remain
with
the
sieur
de
tonty
this
was
the
journey
which
ended
in
that
scene
of
horror
at
the
ruined
town
of
the
illinois
sidenote
charged
with
ostentation
to
the
same
correspondent
pressing
him
for
dividends
he
says
you
repeat
continually
that
you
will
not
be
satisfied
unless
i
make
you
large
returns
of
profit
though
i
have
reason
to
thank
you
for
what
you
have
done
for
this
enterprise
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
done
still
more
since
i
have
put
everything
at
stake
and
it
would
be
hard
to
reproach
me
either
with
foolish
outlays
or
with
the
ostentation
which
is
falsely
imputed
to
me
let
my
accusers
explain
what
they
mean
since
i
have
been
in
this
country
i
have
had
neither
servants
nor
clothes
nor
fare
which
did
not
savor
more
of
meanness
than
of
ostentation
and
the
moment
i
see
that
there
is
anything
with
which
either
you
or
the
court
find
fault
i
assure
you
that
i
will
give
it
up
for
the
life
i
am
leading
has
no
other
attraction
for
me
than
that
of
honor
and
the
more
danger
and
difficulty
there
is
in
undertakings
of
this
sort
the
more
worthy
of
honor
i
think
they
are
his
career
attests
the
sincerity
of
these
words
they
are
a
momentary
betrayal
of
the
deep
enthusiasm
of
character
which
may
be
read
in
his
life
but
to
which
he
rarely
allowed
the
faintest
expression
above
all
he
continues
if
you
want
me
to
keep
on
do
not
compel
me
to
reply
to
all
the
questions
and
fancies
of
priests
and
jesuits
they
have
more
leisure
than
i
and
i
am
not
subtle
enough
to
anticipate
all
their
empty
stories
i
could
easily
give
you
the
information
you
ask
but
i
have
a
right
to
expect
that
you
will
not
believe
all
you
hear
nor
require
me
to
prove
to
you
that
i
am
not
a
madman
that
is
the
first
point
to
which
you
should
have
attended
before
having
business
with
me
and
in
our
long
acquaintance
either
you
must
have
found
me
out
or
else
i
must
have
had
long
intervals
of
sanity
to
another
correspondent
he
defends
himself
against
the
charge
of
harshness
to
his
men
the
facility
i
am
said
to
want
is
out
of
place
with
this
sort
of
people
who
are
libertines
for
the
most
part
and
to
indulge
them
means
to
tolerate
blasphemy
drunkenness
lewdness
and
a
license
incompatible
with
any
kind
of
order
it
will
not
be
found
that
i
have
in
any
case
whatever
treated
any
man
harshly
except
for
blasphemies
and
other
such
crimes
openly
committed
these
i
can
not
tolerate
first
because
such
compliance
would
give
grounds
for
another
accusation
much
more
just
secondly
because
if
i
allowed
such
disorders
to
become
habitual
it
would
be
hard
to
keep
the
men
in
subordination
and
obedience
as
regards
executing
the
work
i
am
commissioned
to
do
thirdly
because
the
debaucheries
too
common
with
this
rabble
are
the
source
of
endless
delays
and
frequent
thieving
and
finally
because
i
am
a
christian
and
do
not
want
to
bear
the
burden
of
their
crimes
sidenote
intrigues
against
him
what
is
said
about
my
servants
has
not
even
a
show
of
truth
for
i
use
no
servants
here
and
all
my
men
are
on
the
same
footing
i
grant
that
as
those
who
have
lived
with
me
are
steadier
and
give
me
no
reason
to
complain
of
their
behavior
i
treat
them
as
gently
as
i
should
treat
the
others
if
they
resembled
them
and
as
those
who
were
formerly
my
servants
are
the
only
ones
i
can
trust
i
speak
more
openly
to
them
than
to
the
rest
who
are
generally
spies
of
my
enemies
the
men
who
deserted
and
robbed
me
are
not
to
be
believed
on
their
word
deserters
and
thieves
as
they
are
they
are
ready
enough
to
find
some
pretext
for
their
crime
and
it
needs
as
unjust
a
judge
as
the
intendant
to
prompt
such
rascals
to
enter
complaints
against
a
person
to
whom
he
had
given
a
warrant
to
arrest
them
but
to
show
the
falsity
of
these
charges
martin
chartier
who
was
one
of
those
who
excited
the
rest
to
do
as
they
did
was
never
with
me
at
all
and
the
rest
had
made
their
plot
before
seeing
me
and
he
proceeds
to
relate
in
great
detail
a
variety
of
circumstances
to
prove
that
his
men
had
been
instigated
first
to
desert
and
then
to
slander
him
adding
those
who
remain
with
me
are
the
first
i
had
and
they
have
not
left
me
for
six
years
i
have
a
hundred
other
proofs
of
the
bad
counsel
given
to
these
deserters
and
will
produce
them
when
wanted
but
as
they
themselves
are
the
only
witnesses
of
the
severity
they
complain
of
while
the
witnesses
of
their
crimes
are
unimpeachable
why
am
i
refused
the
justice
i
demand
and
why
is
their
secret
escape
connived
at
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
having
popular
manners
there
is
nothing
special
in
my
food
clothing
or
lodging
which
are
all
the
same
for
me
as
for
my
men
how
can
it
be
that
i
do
not
talk
with
them
i
have
no
other
company
de
tonty
has
often
found
fault
with
me
because
i
stopped
too
often
to
talk
with
them
you
do
not
know
the
men
one
must
employ
here
when
you
exhort
me
to
make
merry
with
them
they
are
incapable
of
that
for
they
are
never
pleased
unless
one
gives
free
rein
to
their
drunkenness
and
other
vices
if
that
is
what
you
call
having
popular
manners
neither
honor
nor
inclination
would
let
me
stoop
to
gain
their
favor
in
a
way
so
disreputable
and
besides
the
consequences
would
be
dangerous
and
they
would
have
the
same
contempt
for
me
that
they
have
for
all
who
treat
them
in
this
fashion
you
write
me
that
even
my
friends
say
that
i
am
not
a
man
of
popular
manners
i
do
not
know
what
friends
they
are
i
know
of
none
in
this
country
to
all
appearance
they
are
enemies
more
subtle
and
secret
than
the
rest
i
make
no
exceptions
for
i
know
that
those
who
seem
to
give
me
support
do
not
do
it
out
of
love
for
me
but
because
they
are
in
some
sort
bound
in
honor
and
that
in
their
hearts
they
think
i
have
dealt
ill
with
them
plet
will
tell
you
what
he
has
heard
about
it
himself
and
the
reasons
they
have
to
give
i
have
seen
it
for
a
long
time
and
these
secret
stabs
they
give
me
show
it
very
plainly
after
that
it
is
not
surprising
that
i
open
my
mind
to
nobody
and
distrust
everybody
i
have
reasons
that
i
can
not
write
for
the
rest
monsieur
pray
be
well
assured
that
the
information
you
are
so
good
as
to
give
me
is
received
with
a
gratitude
equal
to
the
genuine
friendship
from
which
it
proceeds
and
however
unjust
are
the
charges
made
against
me
i
should
be
much
more
unjust
myself
if
i
did
not
feel
that
i
have
as
much
reason
to
thank
you
for
telling
me
of
them
as
i
have
to
complain
of
others
for
inventing
them
sidenote
his
manners
as
for
what
you
say
about
my
look
and
manner
i
myself
confess
that
you
are
not
far
from
right
but
and
if
i
am
wanting
in
expansiveness
and
show
of
feeling
towards
those
with
whom
i
associate
is
only
through
a
timidity
which
is
natural
to
me
and
which
has
made
me
leave
various
employments
where
without
it
i
could
have
but
as
i
judged
myself
for
them
on
account
of
this
defect
i
have
chosen
a
life
more
suited
to
my
solitary
disposition
which
nevertheless
does
not
make
me
harsh
to
my
people
though
joined
to
a
life
among
savages
it
makes
me
perhaps
less
polished
and
complaisant
than
the
atmosphere
of
paris
requires
i
well
believe
that
there
is
in
this
and
that
knowing
how
little
i
am
accustomed
to
a
more
polite
life
the
fear
of
making
mistakes
makes
me
more
reserved
than
i
like
to
be
so
i
rarely
expose
myself
to
conversation
with
those
in
whose
company
i
am
afraid
of
making
blunders
and
can
hardly
help
making
them
abbé
renaudot
knows
with
what
repugnance
i
had
the
honor
to
appear
before
monseigneur
de
conti
and
sometimes
it
took
me
a
week
to
make
up
my
mind
to
go
to
the
audience
that
is
when
i
had
time
to
think
about
myself
and
was
not
driven
by
pressing
business
it
is
much
the
same
with
letters
which
i
never
write
except
when
pushed
to
it
and
for
the
same
reason
it
is
a
defect
of
which
i
shall
never
rid
myself
as
long
as
i
live
often
as
it
spites
me
against
myself
and
often
as
i
quarrel
with
myself
about
it
sidenote
his
strength
and
weakness
here
is
a
strange
confession
for
a
man
like
la
salle
without
doubt
the
timidity
of
which
he
accuses
himself
had
some
of
its
roots
in
pride
but
not
the
less
was
his
pride
vexed
and
humbled
by
it
it
is
surprising
that
being
what
he
was
he
could
have
brought
himself
to
such
an
avowal
under
any
circumstances
or
any
pressure
of
distress
shyness
a
morbid
fear
of
committing
himself
and
incapacity
to
express
and
much
more
to
simulate
feeling
a
trait
sometimes
seen
in
those
with
whom
feeling
is
most
deep
are
strange
ingredients
in
the
character
of
a
man
who
had
grappled
so
dauntlessly
with
life
on
its
harshest
and
rudest
side
they
were
deplorable
defects
for
one
in
his
position
he
lacked
that
sympathetic
power
the
inestimable
gift
of
the
true
leader
of
men
in
which
lies
the
difference
between
a
willing
and
a
constrained
obedience
this
solitary
being
hiding
his
shyness
under
a
cold
reserve
could
rouse
no
enthusiasm
in
his
followers
he
lived
in
the
purpose
which
he
had
made
a
part
of
himself
nursed
his
plans
in
secret
and
seldom
asked
or
accepted
advice
he
trusted
himself
and
learned
more
and
more
to
trust
no
others
one
may
fairly
infer
that
distrust
was
natural
to
him
but
the
inference
may
possibly
be
wrong
bitter
experience
had
schooled
him
to
it
for
he
lived
among
snares
pitfalls
and
intriguing
enemies
he
began
to
doubt
even
the
associates
who
under
representations
he
had
made
them
in
perfect
good
faith
had
staked
their
money
on
his
enterprise
and
lost
it
or
were
likely
to
lose
it
they
pursued
him
with
advice
and
complaint
and
half
believed
that
he
was
what
his
maligners
called
him
a
visionary
or
a
madman
it
galled
him
that
they
had
suffered
for
their
trust
in
him
and
that
they
had
repented
their
trust
his
lonely
and
shadowed
nature
needed
the
mellowing
sunshine
of
success
and
his
whole
life
was
a
fight
with
adversity
all
that
appears
to
the
eye
is
his
intrepid
conflict
with
obstacles
without
but
this
perhaps
was
no
more
arduous
than
the
invisible
and
silent
strife
of
a
nature
at
war
with
itself
the
pride
aspiration
and
bold
energy
that
lay
at
the
base
of
his
character
battling
against
the
superficial
weakness
that
mortified
and
angered
him
in
such
a
man
the
effect
of
such
an
infirmity
is
to
concentrate
and
intensify
the
force
within
in
one
form
or
another
discordant
natures
are
common
enough
but
very
rarely
is
the
antagonism
so
irreconcilable
as
it
was
in
him
and
the
greater
the
antagonism
the
greater
the
pain
there
are
those
in
whom
the
sort
of
timidity
from
which
he
suffered
is
matched
with
no
quality
that
strongly
revolts
against
it
these
gentle
natures
may
at
least
have
peace
but
for
him
there
was
no
peace

is

thought
for
an

of
the
adventures
and
vicissitudes
he
had
passed
since
he
occupied
them
before
another
ordeal
awaited
him
he
must
confront
not
painted

with

and

but
what
he
shrank
from
more
the
courtly
throngs
that
still
live
and
move
in
the
pages
of
sévigné
and
the
news
of
his
discovery
and
the
rumor
of
his
schemes
were
the
talk
of
a
moment
among
the
courtiers
and
then
were
forgotten
it
was
not
so
with

friends
and
patrons
did
not
fail
him
a
student
and
a
recluse
in
his
youth
and
a
backwoodsman
in
his
manhood
he
had
what
was
to
him
the
formidable
honor
of
an
interview
with
royalty
itself
and
stood
with
such
philosophy
as
he
could
command
before
the
gilded
where
majestic
and
awful
the
power
of
france
sat
embodied
the
king
listened
to
all
he
said
but
the
results
of
the
interview
were
kept
so
secret
that
it
was
rumored
in
the
that
his
proposals
had
been
rejected
on
the
contrary
they
had
met
with
more
than
favor
the
moment
was
opportune
for
la
salle
the
king
had
long
been
irritated
against
the
spaniards
because
they
not
only
excluded
his
subjects
from
their
american
ports
but
forbade
them
to
enter
the
gulf
of
mexico
certain
frenchmen
who
had
sailed
on
this
forbidden
sea
had
been
seized
and
imprisoned
and
more
recently
a
small
vessel
of
the
royal
navy
had
been
captured
for
the
same
offence
this
had
drawn
from
the
king
a
declaration
that
every
sea
should
be
free
to
all
his
subjects
and
count
was
sent
with
a
squadron
to
the
gulf
to
exact
satisfaction
of
the
spaniards
or
fight
them
if
they
refused
it
this
was
in
time
of
peace
war
had
since
arisen
between
the
two
crowns
and
brought
with
it
the
opportunity
of
settling
the
question
forever
in
order
to
do
so
the
minister
seignelay
like
his
father
colbert
proposed
to
establish
a
french
port
on
the
gulf
as
a
permanent
menace
to
the
spaniards
and
a
basis
of
future
conquest
it
was
in
view
of
this
plan
that
la
past
enterprises
had
been
favored
and
the
proposals
he
now
made
were
in
perfect
accord
with
it
sidenote
la
salle
proposals
these
proposals
were
set
forth
in
two
memorials
the
first
of
them
states
that
the
late
monseigneur
colbert
deemed
it
important
for
the
service
of
his
majesty
to
discover
a
port
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
that
to
this
end
the
memorialist
la
salle
made
five
journeys
of
upwards
of
five
thousand
leagues
in
great
part
on
foot
and
traversed
more
than
six
hundred
leagues
of
unknown
country
among
savages
and
cannibals
at
the
cost
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
he
now
proposes
to
return
by
way
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
to
the
countries
he
has
discovered
whence
great
benefits
may
be
expected
first
the
cause
of
god
may
be
advanced
by
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
to
many
indian
tribes
and
secondly
great
conquests
may
be
effected
for
the
glory
of
the
king
by
the
seizure
of
provinces
rich
in
silver
mines
and
defended
only
by
a
few
indolent
and
effeminate
spaniards
the
sieur
de
la
salle
pursues
the
memorial
binds
himself
to
be
ready
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
enterprise
within
one
year
after
his
arrival
on
the
spot
and
he
asks
for
this
purpose
only
one
vessel
and
two
hundred
men
with
their
arms
munitions
pay
and
maintenance
when
monseigneur
shall
direct
him
he
will
give
the
details
of
what
he
proposes
the
memorial
then
describes
the
boundless
extent
the
fertility
and
resources
of
the
country
watered
by
the
river
colbert
or
mississippi
the
necessity
of
guarding
it
against
foreigners
who
will
be
eager
to
seize
it
now
that
la
salle
discovery
has
made
it
known
and
the
ease
with
which
it
may
be
defended
by
one
or
two
forts
at
a
proper
distance
above
its
mouth
which
would
form
the
key
to
an
interior
region
eight
hundred
leagues
in
extent
should
foreigners
anticipate
us
he
adds
they
will
complete
the
ruin
of

which
they
already
hem
in
by
their
establishments
of
virginia

england
and
hudson
bay
the
second
memorial
is
more
explicit
the
place
it
says
which
the
sieur
de
la
salle
proposes
to
fortify
is
on
the
river
colbert
or
mississippi
sixty
leagues
above
its
mouth
where
the
soil
is
very
fertile
the
climate
very
mild
and
whence
we
the
french
may
control
the
continent
since
the
river
being
narrow
we
could
defend
ourselves
by
means
of
against
a
hostile
fleet
while
the
position
is
excellent
both
for
attacking
an
enemy
or
retreating
in
case
of
need
the
neighboring
indians
detest
the
spaniards
but
love
the
french
having
been
won
over
by
the
kindness
of
the
sieur
de
la
salle
we
could
form
of
them
an
army
of
more
than
fifteen
thousand
savages
who
supported
by
the
french
and
abenakis
followers
of
the
sieur
de
la
salle
could
easily
subdue
the
province
of
new
biscay
the
most
northern
province
of
mexico
where
there
are
but
four
hundred
spaniards
more
fit
to
work
the
mines
than
to
fight
on
the
north
of
new
biscay
lie
vast
forests
extending
to
the
river
seignelay
red
river
which
is
but
forty
or
fifty
leagues
from
the
spanish
province
this
river
affords
the
means
of
attacking
it
to
great
advantage
in
view
of
these
facts
pursues
the
memorial
the
sieur
de
la
salle
offers
if
the
war
with
spain
continues
to
undertake
this
conquest
with
two
hundred
men
from
france
he
will
take
on
his
way
fifty
buccaneers
at
domingo
and
direct
the
four
thousand
indian
warriors
at
fort
louis
of
the
illinois
to
descend
the
river
and
join
him
he
will
separate
his
force
into
three
divisions
and
attack
at
the
same
time
the
centre
and
the
two
extremities
of
the
province
to
accomplish
this
great
design
he
asks
only
for
a
vessel
of
thirty
guns
a
few
cannon
for
the
forts
and
power
to
raise
in
france
two
hundred
such
men
as
he
shall
think
fit
to
be
armed
paid
and
maintained
six
months
at
the
charge
and
the
sieur
de
la
salle
binds
himself
if
the
execution
of
this
plan
is
prevented
for
more
than
three
years
by
peace
with
spain
to
refund
to
his
majesty
all
the
costs
of
the
enterprise
on
pain
of
forfeiting
the
government
of
the
ports
he
will
have
established
sidenote
la
salles
plans
such
in
brief
was
the
substance
of
this
singular
proposition
and
first
it
is
to
be
observed
that
it
is
based
on
a
geographical
blunder
the
nature
of
which
is
explained
by
the
map
of
la
salle
discoveries
made
in
this
very
year
here
the
river
seignelay
or
red
river
is
represented
as
running
parallel
to
the
northern
border
of
mexico
and
at
no
great
distance
from
it
the
region
now
called
texas
being
almost
entirely
suppressed
according
to
the
map
new
biscay
might
be
reached
from
this
river
in
a
few
days
and
after
crossing
the
intervening
forests
the
coveted
mines
of
ste
barbe
or
santa
barbara
would
be
within
striking
distance
that
la
salle
believed
in
the
possibility
of
invading
the
spanish
province
of
new
biscay
from
red
river
there
can
be
no
doubt
neither
can
it
reasonably
be
doubted
that
he
hoped
at
some
future
day
to
make
the
attempt
and
yet
it
is
incredible
that
a
man
in
his
sober
senses
could
have
proposed
this
scheme
with
the
intention
of
attempting
to
execute
it
at
the
time
and
in
the
manner
which
he
indicates
this
memorial
bears
some
indications
of
being
drawn
up
in
order
to
produce
a
certain
effect
on
the
minds
of
the
king
and
his
minister
la
salle
immediate
necessity
was
to
obtain
from
them
the
means
for
establishing
a
fort
and
a
colony
within
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
this
was
essential
to
his
own
plans
nor
did
he
in
the
least
exaggerate
the
value
of
such
an
establishment
to
the
french
nation
and
the
importance
of
anticipating
other
powers
in
the
possession
of
it
but
he
thought
that
he
needed
a
more
glittering
lure
to
attract
the
eyes
of
louis
and
seignelay
and
thus
it
may
be
he
held
before
them
in
a
definite
and
tangible
form
the
project
of
spanish
conquest
which
had
haunted
his
imagination
from
youth
trusting
that
the
speedy
conclusion
of
peace
which
actually
took
place
would
absolve
him
from
the
immediate
execution
of
the
scheme
and
give
him
time
with
the
means
placed
at
his
disposal
to
mature
his
plans
and
prepare
for
eventual
action
such
a
procedure
may
be
charged
with
indirectness
but
there
is
a
different
explanation
which
we
shall
suggest
hereafter
and
which
implies
no
such
reproach
even
with
this
madcap
enterprise
lopped
off

and
colonization
perfectly
sound

itself

too
vast
for
an
individual
above
all
for
one
crippled
and
crushed
with
debt
while
he
grasped
one
link
of
the
great
chain
another
no
less
essential
escaped
from
his
hand
while
he
built
up
a
colony
on
the
mississippi
it
was
reasonably
certain
that
evil
would
befall
his
distant
colony
of
the
illinois

the
glittering
project
which
he
now
unfolded

favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
king
and
his
minister

both
were
in
the
flush
of
an
unparalleled
success
and
looked
in
the
future
as
in
the
past
for
nothing
but
triumphs
they
granted
more
than
the
petitioner

as
indeed
they
well
might
if
they
expected

the

himself
wrote
to

in
a
strain
that
must
have
sent
a
cold
thrill
through
the
veins
of
that
official
i
hear
he
says
that
you
have
taken

of

away

to

and
even
told
the
iroquois
that
they
might
seize
him
as
an
enemy
of

he
adds
that
if
this
is
true
la

must
make
reparation
for
the
wrong
and
place
all

as
well
as

to
me
that

been

later

wrote
to
the

the
effect
that
the
bearer

is
to
suffer
no
impediment

that

to

not

were
enrolled
besides

and
thirty

including

and

joined
the

and
as
the
plan
was
one
no
less
of

than
of

several

embarked
for

gave

to

a
captain
of
the
royal

whose
authority
was
restricted
to
their
management
at

while

was
to
prescribe
the

they
were
to
take
and
have
entire
control
of
the

and

this
arrangement
displeased
both
parties
beaujeu
an
old
and
experienced
officer
was
galled
that
a
civilian
should
be
set
over
him
and
he
too
a
burgher
lately
ennobled
nor
was
la
salle
the
man
to
soothe
his
ruffled
spirit
detesting
a
divided
command
cold
reserved
and
impenetrable
he
would
have
tried
the
patience
of
a
less
excitable
colleague
beaujeu
on
his
part
though
set
to
a
task
which
he
disliked
seems
to
have
meant
to
do
his
duty
and
to
have
been
willing
at
the
outset
to
make
the
relations
between
himself
and
his
unwelcome
associate
as
agreeable
as
possible
unluckily
la
salle
discovered
that
the
wife
of
beaujeu
was
devoted
to
the
jesuits
we
have
seen
the
extreme
distrust
with
which
he
regarded
these
guides
of
his
youth
and
he
seems
now
to
have
fancied
that
beaujeu
was
their
secret
ally
possibly
he
suspected
that
information
of
his
movements
would
be
given
to
the
spaniards
more
probably
he
had
undefined
fears
of
adverse
machinations
granting
that
such
existed
it
was
not
his
interest
to
stimulate
them
by
needlessly
exasperating
the
naval
commander
his
deportment
however
was
not
conciliating
and
beaujeu
prepared
to
dislike
him
presently
lost
temper
while
the
vessels
still
lay
at
rochelle
while
all
was
bustle
and
preparation
while
stores
arms
and
munitions
were
embarking
while
boys
and
vagabonds
were
enlisting
as
soldiers
for
the
expedition
beaujeu
was
venting
his
disgust
in
long
letters
to
the
minister
sidenote
beaujeu
and
la
salle
you
have
ordered
me
monseigneur
to
give
all
possible
aid
to
this
undertaking
and
i
shall
do
so
to
the
best
of
my
power
but
permit
me
to
take
great
credit
to
myself
for
i
find
it
very
hard
to
submit
to
the
orders
of
the
sieur
de
la
salle
whom
i
believe
to
be
a
man
of
merit
but
who
has
no
experience
of
war
except
with
savages
and
who
has
no
rank
while
i
have
been
captain
of
a
ship
thirteen
years
and
have
served
thirty
by
sea
and
land
besides
monseigneur
he
has
told
me
that
in
case
of
his
death
you
have
directed
that
the
sieur
de
tonty
shall
succeed
him
this
indeed
is
very
hard
for
though
i
am
not
acquainted
with
that
country
i
should
be
very
dull
if
being
on
the
spot
i
did
not
know
at
the
end
of
a
month
as
much
of
it
as
they
do
i
beg
monseigneur
that
i
may
at
least
share
the
command
with
them
and
that
as
regards
war
nothing
may
be
done
without
my
knowledge
and
concurrence
for
as
to
their
commerce
i
neither
intend
nor
desire
to
know
anything
about
it
seignelay
answered
by
a
rebuff
and
told
him
to
make
no
trouble
about
the
command
this
increased
his
irritation
and
he
wrote
in
my
last
letter
monseigneur
i
represented
to
you
the
hardship
of
compelling
me
to
obey
de
la
salle
who
has
no
rank
and
commanded
anybody
but
and
i
begged
you
at
least
to
divide
the
command
between
us
i
now
monseigneur
take
the
liberty
to
say
that
i
will
obey
without
repugnance
if
you
order
me
to
do
so
having
reflected
that
there
can
be
no
competition
between
the
said
sieur
de
la
salle
and
me
thus
far
he
has
not
told
me
his
plan
and
he
changes
his
mind
every
moment
he
is
a
man
so
suspicious
and
so
afraid
that
one
will
penetrate
his
secrets
that
i
dare
not
ask
him
anything
he
says
that
de
parassy
commissary
clerk
with
whom
he
has
often
quarrelled
is
paid
by
his
enemies
to
defeat
his
undertaking
and
many
other
things
with
which
i
will
not
trouble
you
he
pretends
that
i
am
only
to
command
the
sailors
and
have
no
authority
over
the
volunteer
officers
and
the
hundred
soldiers
who
are
to
take
passage
in
the
and
that
they
are
not
to
recognize
or
obey
me
in
any
way
during
the
voyage
he
has
covered
the
decks
with
boxes
and
chests
of
such
prodigious
size
that
neither
the
cannon
nor
the
capstan
can
be
worked
la
salle
drew
up
a
long
list
of
articles
defining
the
respective
rights
and
functions
of
himself
and
beaujeu
to
whom
he
presented
it
for
signature
beaujeu
demurred
at
certain
military
honors
demanded
by
la
salle
saying
that
if
a
marshal
of
france
should
come
on
board
his
ship
he
would
have
none
left
to
offer
him
the
point
was
referred
to
the
naval
intendant
and
the
articles
of
the
treaty
having
been
slightly
modified
beaujeu
set
his
name
to
it
by
this
he
says
you
can
judge
better
of
the
character
of
de
la
salle
than
by
all
i
can
say
he
is
a
man
who
wants
smoke
form
and
ceremony
i
will
give
him
his
fill
of
it
and
perhaps
more
than
he
likes
i
am
bound
to
an
unknown
country
to
seek
what
is
about
as
hard
to
find
as
the
philosopher
stone
it
vexes
me
monseigneur
that
you
should
have
been
involved
in
a
business
the
success
of
which
is
very
uncertain
de
la
salle
begins
to
doubt
it
himself
while
beaujeu
wrote
thus
to
the
minister
he
was
also
writing
to
cabart
de
villermont
one
of
his
friends
at
paris
with
whom
la
salle
was
also
on
friendly
terms
these
letters
are
lively
and
entertaining
and
by
no
means
suggestive
of
any
secret
conspiracy
he
might
it
is
true
have
been
more
reserved
in
his
communications
but
he
betrays
no
confidence
for
none
was
placed
in
him
it
is
the
familiar
correspondence
of
an
irritable
but
not
veteran
who
is
placed
in
an
annoying
position
and
thinks
he
is
making
the
best
of
it
la
salle
thought
that
the
minister
had
been
too
free
in
communicating
the
secrets
of
the
expedition
to
the
naval
intendant
at
rochefort
and
through
him
to
beaujeu
it
is
hard
to
see
how
beaujeu
was
to
blame
for
this
but
la
salle
nevertheless
fell
into
a
dispute
with
him
he
could
hardly
keep
his
temper
and
used
expressions
which
obliged
me
to
tell
him
that
i
cared
very
little
about
his
affairs
and
that
the
king
himself
would
not
speak
as
he
did
he
retracted
made
excuses
and
we
parted
good
friends
i
do
not
like
his
suspiciousness
i
think
him
a
good
honest
norman
but
normans
are
out
of
fashion
it
is
one
thing
another
it
seems
to
me
that
he
is
not
so
sure
about
his
undertaking
as
he
was
at
paris
this
morning
he
came
to
see
me
and
told
me
he
had
changed
his
mind
and
meant
to
give
a
new
turn
to
the
business
and
go
to
another
coast
he
gave
very
poor
reasons
to
which
i
assented
to
avoid
a
quarrel
i
thought
by
what
he
said
that
he
wanted
to
find
a
scapegoat
to
bear
the
blame
in
case
his
plan
does
not
succeed
as
he
hopes
for
the
rest
i
think
him
a
brave
man
and
a
true
and
i
am
persuaded
that
if
this
business
fails
it
will
be
because
he
does
not
know
enough
and
will
not
trust
us
of
the
profession
as
for
me
i
shall
do
my
best
to
help
him
as
i
have
told
you
before
and
i
am
delighted
to
have
him
keep
his
secret
so
that
i
shall
not
have
to
answer
for
the
result
pray
do
not
show
my
letters
for
fear
of
committing
me
with
him
he
is
too
suspicious
already
and
never
was
norman
so
norman
as
he
which
is
a
great
hinderance
to
business
beaujeu
came
from
the
same
province
and
calls
himself
jocularly
bon
gros
his
however
rapidly
gave
way
as
time
went
on
yesterday
he
writes
this
monsieur
told
me
that
he
meant
to
go
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
a
little
while
ago
as
i
said
before
he
talked
about
going
to
canada
i
see
nothing
certain
in
it
it
is
not
that
i
do
not
believe
that
all
he
says
is
true
but
not
being
of
the
profession
and
not
liking
to
betray
his
ignorance
he
is
puzzled
what
to
do
i
shall
go
straight
forward
without
regarding
a
thousand
whims
and
his
continual
suspicion
would
drive
anybody
mad
except
a
norman
like
me
but
i
shall
humor
him
as
i
have
always
done
even
to
sailing
my
ship
on
dry
land
if
he
likes
sidenote
an
open
quarrel
a
few
days
later
there
was
an
open
quarrel
de
la
salle
came
to
me
and
said
rather
haughtily
and
in
a
tone
of
command
that
i
must
put
provisions
for
three
months
more
on
board
my
vessel
i
told
him
it
was
impossible
as
she
had
more
lading
already
than
anybody
ever
dared
to
put
in
her
before
he
would
not
hear
reason
but
got
angry
and
abused
me
in
good
french
and
found
fault
with
me
because
the
vessel
would
not
hold
his
three
months
provisions
he
said
i
ought
to
have
told
him
of
it
before
how
would
you
have
me
tell
you
said
i
you
never
tell
me
what
you
mean
to
do
we
had
still
another
quarrel
he
asked
me
where
his
officers
should
take
their
meals
i
told
him
that
they
might
take
them
where
he
pleased
for
i
gave
myself
no
trouble
in
the
matter
having
no
orders
he
answered
that
they
should
not
mess
on
bacon
while
the
rest
ate
fowls
and
mutton
i
said
that
if
he
would
send
fowls
and
mutton
on
board
his
people
should
eat
them
but
as
for
bacon
i
had
often
ate
it
myself
at
this
he
went
off
and
complained
to
dugué
that
i
refused
to
embark
his
provisions
and
told
him
that
he
must
live
on
bacon
i
excused
him
as
not
knowing
how
to
behave
himself
having
spent
his
life
among
brats
and
savages
nevertheless
i
offered
to
him
his
brother
and
two
of
his
friends
seats
at
my
table
and
the
same
fare
as
myself
he
answered
my
civility
by
an
impertinence
saying
that
he
distrusted
people
who
offered
so
much
and
seemed
so
obliging
i
could
not
help
telling
him
that
i
saw
he
was
brought
up
in
the
provinces
this
was
touching
la
salle
on
a
sensitive
point
beaujeu
continues
in
fact
you
knew
him
better
than
i
for
i
always
took
him
for
a
gentleman
i
see
now
that
he
is
anything
but
that
pray
set
abbé
renaudot
and
morel
right
about
this
man
and
tell
them
he
is
not
what
they
take
him
for
adieu
it
has
struck
twelve
the
postman
is
just
going
bad
as
was
the
state
of
things
it
soon
grew
worse
renaudot
wrote
to
la
salle
that
beaujeu
was
writing
to
villermont
everything
that
happened
and
that
villermont
showed
the
letters
to
all
his
acquaintance
villermont
was
a
relative
of
the
jesuit
beschefer
and
this
was
sufficient
to
suggest
some
secret
machination
to
the
mind
of
la
salle
villermont
fault
however
seems
to
have
been
simple
indiscretion
for
which
beaujeu
took
him
sharply
to
task
i
asked
you
to
burn
my
letters
and
i
can
not
help
saying
that
i
am
angry
with
you
not
because
you
make
known
my
secrets
but
because
you
show
letters
scrawled
in
haste
and
sent
off
without
being
even
read
over
de
la
salle
not
having
told
me
his
secret
though
de
seignelay
ordered
him
to
tell
me
i
am
not
obliged
to
keep
it
and
have
as
good
a
right
as
anybody
to
make
my
conjectures
on
what
i
read
about
it
in
the
de
let
abbé
renaudot
glorify
de
la
salle
as
much
as
he
likes
and
make
him
a
cortez
a
pizarro
or
an
almagro
that
is
nothing
to
me
but
do
not
let
him
speak
of
me
as
an
obstacle
in
his
hero
way
let
him
understand
that
i
know
how
to
execute
the
orders
of
the
court
as
well
as
he
sidenote
la
salle
indiscretion
you
ask
how
i
get
on
with
de
la
salle
do
you
know
that
this
man
is
impenetrable
and
that
there
is
no
knowing
what
he
thinks
of
one
he
told
a
person
of
note
whom
i
will
not
name
that
he
had
suspicions
about
our
correspondence
as
well
as
about
madame
de
beaujeu
devotion
to
the
jesuits
his
distrust
is
incredible
if
he
sees
one
of
his
people
speak
to
the
rest
he
suspects
something
and
is
gruff
with
them
he
told
me
himself
that
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
de
tonty
who
is
in
america
la
salle
claim
to
exclusive
command
of
the
soldiers
on
board
the
joly
was
a
source
of
endless
trouble
beaujeu
declared
that
he
would
not
set
sail
till
officers
soldiers
and
volunteers
had
all
sworn
to
obey
him
when
at
sea
at
which
la
salle
had
the
indiscretion
to
say
if
i
am
not
master
of
my
soldiers
how
can
i
make
him
beaujeu
do
his
duty
in
case
he
does
not
want
to
do
it
beaujeu
says
that
this
affair
made
a
great
noise
among
the
officers
at
rochefort
and
adds
are
very
few
people
who
do
not
think
that
his
brain
is
i
have
spoken
to
some
who
have
known
him
twenty
years
they
all
say
that
he
was
always
rather
visionary
it
is
difficult
not
to
suspect
that
the
current
belief
at
rochefort
had
some
foundation
and
that
the
deadly
strain
of
extreme
hardship
prolonged
anxiety
and
alternation
of
disaster
and
success
joined
to
the
fever
which
nearly
killed
him
had
unsettled
his
judgment
and
given
a
morbid
development
to
his
natural
defects
his
universal
suspicion
which
included
even
the
stanch
and
faithful
henri
de
tonty
his
needless
provocation
of
persons
whose
was
necessary
to
him
his
doubts
whether
he
should
sail
for
the
gulf
or
for
canada
when
to
sail
to
canada
would
have
been
to
renounce
or
expose
to
almost
certain
defeat
an
enterprise
long
cherished
and
definitely
planned
all
point
to
one
conclusion
it
may
be
thought
that
his
doubts
were
feigned
in
order
to
hide
his
destination
to
the
last
moment
but
if
so
he
attempted
to
blind
not
only
his
ill
wishers
but
his
mother
whom
he
also
left
in
uncertainty
as
to
his
route
sidenote
an
overwrought
brain
unless
we
assume
that
his
scheme
of
invading
mexico
was
thrown
out
as
a
bait
to
the
king
it
is
hard
to
reconcile
it
with
the
supposition
of
mental
soundness
to
base
so
critical
an
attempt
on
a
geographical
conjecture
which
rested
on
the
slightest
possible
information
and
was
in
fact
a
total
error
to
postpone
the
perfectly
sound
plan
of
securing
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
to
a
wild
project
of
leading
fifteen
thousand
savages
for
an
unknown
distance
through
an
unknown
country
to
attack
an
unknown
enemy
was
something
more
than
quixotic
daring
the
king
and
the
minister
saw
nothing
impracticable
in
it
for
they
did
not
know
the
country
or
its
inhabitants
they
saw
no
insuperable
difficulty
in
mustering
and
keeping
together
fifteen
thousand
of
the
most
wayward
and
unstable
savages
on
earth
split
into
a
score
and
more
of
tribes
some
hostile
to
each
other
and
some
to
the
french
nor
in
the
problem
of
feeding
such
a
mob
on
a
march
of
hundreds
of
miles
nor
in
the
plan
of
drawing
four
thousand
of
them
from
the
illinois
nearly
two
thousand
miles
distant
though
some
of
these
intended
allies
had
no
canoes
or
other
means
of
transportation
and
though
travelling
in
such
numbers
they
would
infallibly
starve
on
the
way
to
the
rendezvous
it
is
difficult
not
to
see
in
all
this
the
chimera
of
an
overwrought
brain
no
longer
able
to
distinguish
between
the
possible
and
the
impossible
preparation
dragged
slowly
on

season

indeed

placed

beyond

while
the
plan
as
proposed
in

was
clearly
impracticable
the
subsequent
experience
of

tended
to
prove
that
the

could
be
used
with
advantage
in
attacking
the

that

might

another

with

aims
but
much
more
practicable
was
at
this
very
time
before
the
court
count
peñalossa
a
spanish
creole
born
in
peru
had
been
governor
of
new
mexico
where
he
fell
into
a
dispute
with
the
inquisition
which
involved
him
in
the
loss
of
property
and
for
a
time
of
liberty
failing
to
obtain
redress
in
spain
he
renounced
his
allegiance
in
disgust
and
sought
refuge
in
france
where
in
he
first
proposed
to
the
king
the
establishment
of
a
colony
of
french
buccaneers
at
the
mouth
of
rio
bravo
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
in
january
after
the
war
had
broken
out
he
proposed
to
attack
the
spanish
town
of
panuco
with
twelve
hundred
buccaneers
from
domingo
then
march
into
the
interior
seize
the
mines
conquer
durango
and
occupy
new
mexico
it
was
proposed
to
combine
his
plan
with
that
of
la
salle
but
the
latter
who
had
an
interview
with
him
expressed
distrust
and
showed
characteristic
reluctance
to
accept
a
colleague
it
is
extremely
probable
however
that
his
knowledge
of
peñalossa
original
proposal
had
some
influence
in
stimulating
him
to
lay
before
the
court
proposals
of
his
own
equally
attractive
peace
was
concluded
before
the
plans
of
the
spanish
adventurer
could
be

there
is
before
me
a

note
of

to

of
livres
dated
at

july
this
seems
to
be
pay
due
to
la
forest
who
had
served
as
la

officer
for
nine
years
a
memorandum
is
attached
signed
by
la

to
the
effect
that
it
is
his
wish
that
la
forest
reimburse
himself
out
of
any
property
of
his
la

in
france
or
canada
the
attitude
of
la
salle
in
this
matter
is
incomprehensible
in
july
la
forest
was
at
rochefort
complaining
because
la
salle
had
ordered
him
to
stay
in
garrison
at
fort
frontenac

july
this
means
an
abandonment
of
the
scheme
of
leading
the
warriors
at
the
rock
of
louis
down
the
mississippi
but
in
the
next
month
la
salle
writes
to
seignelay
that
he
is
afraid
la

will
use
the
iroquois
war
as
a
pretext
to
prevent
la
forest
from
making
his
journey
to
the
illinois
and
that
in
this
case
he
will
himself
try
to
go
up
the
mississippi
and
meet
the
illinois
warriors
so
that
in
five
or
six
months
from
the
date
of
the
letter
the
minister
will
hear
of
his
departure
to
attack
the
spaniards

either
this
is
sheer
folly
or
else

light
a
number
of
letters
from
a
brother
officer
of
beaujeu
written
at
rochefort
just
after
the
departure
of
the
expedition
from
rochelle
and
giving
some
idea
of
the
views
there
entertained
concerning
it
he
says
ne
peut
pas
faire

que

toutes
ses
prétentions

the

disputes
with
st
la

attacked
with
fever
his
desperate
the
gulf
of
a
vain
search
and
a
fatal
error
the
four
ships
sailed
from
rochelle
on
the
of
july
four
days
after
the
joly
broke
her
bowsprit
by
design
as
la
salle
fancied
they
all
put
back
to
rochefort
where
the
mischief
was
quickly
repaired
and
they
put
to
sea
again
la
salle
and
the
chief
persons
of
the
expedition
with
a
crowd
of
soldiers
artisans
and
women
the
destined
mothers
of
louisiana
were
all
on
board
the
joly
beaujeu
wished
to
touch
at
madeira
to
replenish
his
la
salle
refused
lest
by
doing
so
the
secret
of
the
enterprise
might
reach
the
spaniards
one
paget
a
huguenot
took
up
the
word
in
support
of
beaujeu
la
salle
told
him
that
the
affair
was
none
of
his
and
as
paget
persisted
with
increased
warmth
and
freedom
he
demanded
of
beaujeu
if
it
was
with
his
consent
that
a
man
of
no
rank
spoke
to
him
in
that
manner
beaujeu
sustained
the
huguenot
that
is
enough
returned
la
salle
and
withdrew
into
his
cabin
this
was
not
the
first
misunderstanding
nor
was
it
the
last
there
was
incessant
chafing
between
the
two
commanders
and
the
sailors
of
the
joly
were
soon
of
one
mind
with
their
captain
when
the
ship
crossed
the
tropic
they
made
ready
a
tub
on
deck
to
baptize
the
passengers
after
the
villanous
practice
of
the
time
but
la
salle
refused
to
permit
it
at
which
they
were
highly
exasperated
having
promised
themselves
a
bountiful
ransom
in
money
or
liquor
from
their
victims
assuredly
says
joutel
they
would
gladly
have
killed
us
all
sidenote
st
domingo
when
after
a
wretched
voyage
of
two
months
the
ships
reached
domingo
a
fresh
dispute
occurred
it
had
been
resolved
at
a
council
of
officers
to
stop
at
port
de
paix
but
beaujeu
on
pretext
of
a
fair
wind
ran
by
that
place
in
the
night
and
cast
anchor
at
petit
goave
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
la
salle
was
extremely
vexed
for
he
expected
to
meet
at
port
de
paix
the
marquis
de
of
the
islands
bégon
the
intendant
and
de
cussy
governor
of
la
tortue
who
had
orders
to
supply
him
with
provisions
and
give
him
all
possible
aid
the
joly
was
alone
the
other
vessels
had
lagged
behind
she
had
more
than
fifty
sick
men
on
board
and
la
salle
was
of
the
number
he
sent
a
messenger
to
bégon
and
cussy
begging
them
to
come
to
him
ordered
joutel
to
get
the
sick
ashore
suffocating
as
they
were
in
the
hot
and
crowded
ship
and
caused
the
soldiers
to
be
landed
on
a
small
island
in
the
harbor
scarcely
had
the
voyagers
sung
for
their
safe
arrival
when
two
of
the
lagging
vessels
appeared
bringing
tidings
that
the
third
the
ketch
françois
had
been
taken
by
spanish
buccaneers
she
was
laden
with
provisions
tools
and
other
necessaries
for
the
colony
and
the
loss
was
irreparable
beaujeu
was
answerable
for
it
for
had
he
anchored
at
port
de
paix
it
would
not
have
occurred
the
with
bégon
and
cussy
who
presently
arrived
plainly
spoke
their
minds
to
him
sidenote
illness
of
la
salle
la
salle
illness
increased
i
was
walking
with
him
one
day
writes
joutel
when
he
was
seized
of
a
sudden
with
such
a
weakness
that
he
could
not
stand
and
was
obliged
to
lie
down
on
the
ground
when
he
was
a
little
better
i
led
him
to
a
chamber
of
a
house
that
the
brothers
duhaut
had
hired
here
we
put
him
to
bed
and
in
the
morning
he
was
attacked
by
a
violent
fever
it
was
so
violent
that
says
another
of
his
shipmates
his
imagination
pictured
to
him
things
equally
terrible
and
amazing
he
lay
delirious
in
the
wretched
garret
attended
by
his
brother
and
one
or
two
others
who
stood
faithful
to
him
a
goldsmith
of
the
neighborhood
moved
at
his
deplorable
condition
offered
the
use
of
his
house
and
abbé
cavelier
had
him
removed
thither
but
there
was
a
tavern
hard
by
and
the
patient
was
tormented
with
daily
and
nightly
riot
at
the
height
of
the
fever
a
party
of
beaujeu
sailors
spent
a
night
in
singing
and
dancing
before
the
house
and
says
cavelier
the
more
we
begged
them
to
be
quiet
the
more
noise
they
made
la
salle
lost
reason
and
life
but
at
length
his
mind
resumed
its
balance
and
the
violence
of
the
disease
abated
a
friendly
capucin
friar
offered
him
the
shelter
of
his
roof
and
two
of
his
men
supported
him
thither
on
foot
giddy
with
exhaustion
and
hot
with
fever
here
he
found
repose
and
was
slowly
recovering
when
some
of
his
attendants
rashly
told
him
the
loss
of
the
ketch
françois
and
the
consequence
was
a
critical
return
of
the
disease
there
was
no
one
to
fill
his
place
beaujeu
would
not
cavelier
could
not
joutel
the
gardener
son
was
apparently
the
most
trusty
man
of
the
company
but
the
expedition
was
virtually
without
a
head
the
men
roamed
on
shore
and
plunged
into
every
excess
of
debauchery
contracting
diseases
which
eventually
killed
them
sidenote
complaints
of
beaujeu
beaujeu
in
the
extremity
of
resumed
his
correspondence
with
seignelay
but
for
the
illness
of
the
sieur
de
la
salle
he
writes
i
could
not
venture
to
report
to
you
the
progress
of
our
voyage
as
i
am
charged
only
with
the
navigation
and
he
with
the
secrets
but
as
his
malady
has
deprived
him
of
the
use
of
his
faculties
both
of
body
and
mind
i
have
thought
myself
obliged
to
acquaint
you
with
what
is
passing
and
of
the
condition
in
which
we
are
he
then
declares
that
the
ships
freighted
by
la
salle
were
so
slow
that
the
joly
had
continually
been
forced
to
wait
for
them
thus
doubling
the
length
of
the
voyage
that
he
had
not
had
water
enough
for
the
passengers
as
la
salle
had
not
told
him
that
there
were
to
be
any
such
till
the
day
they
came
on
board
that
great
numbers
were
sick
and
that
he
had
told
la
salle
there
would
be
trouble
if
he
filled
all
the
space
between
decks
with
his
goods
and
forced
the
soldiers
and
sailors
to
sleep
on
deck
that
he
had
told
him
he
would
get
no
provisions
at
domingo
but
that
he
insisted
on
stopping
that
it
had
always
been
so
that
whatever
he
proposed
la
salle
would
refuse
alleging
orders
from
the
king
and
now
pursues
the
ruffled
commander
everybody
is
ill
and
he
himself
has
a
violent
fever
as
dangerous
the
surgeon
tells
me
to
the
mind
as
to
the
body
the
rest
of
the
letter
is
in
the
same
strain
he
says
that
a
day
or
two
after
la
salle
illness
began
his
brother
cavelier
came
to
ask
him
to
take
charge
of
his
affairs
but
that
he
did
not
wish
to
meddle
with
them
especially
as
nobody
knows
anything
about
them
and
as
la
salle
has
sold
some
of
the
ammunition
and
provisions
that
cavelier
tells
him
that
he
thinks
his
brother
keeps
no
accounts
wishing
to
hide
his
affairs
from
everybody
that
he
learns
from
buccaneers
that
the
entrance
of
the
mississippi
is
very
shallow
and
difficult
and
that
this
is
the
worst
season
for
navigating
the
gulf
that
the
spaniards
have
in
these
seas
six
vessels
of
from
thirty
to
sixty
guns
each
besides
but
that
he
is
not
afraid
and
will
perish
or
bring
back
an
account
of
the
mississippi
nevertheless
he
adds
if
the
sieur
de
la
salle
dies
i
shall
pursue
a
course
different
from
that
which
he
has
marked
out
for
i
do
not
approve
his
plans
if
he
continues
you
permit
me
to
speak
my
mind
de
la
salle
ought
to
have
been
satisfied
with
discovering
his
river
without
undertaking
to
conduct
three
vessels
with
troops
two
thousand
leagues
through
so
many
different
climates
and
across
seas
entirely
unknown
to
him
i
grant
that
he
is
a
man
of
knowledge
that
he
has
reading
and
even
some
tincture
of
navigation
but
there
is
so
much
difference
between
theory
and
practice
that
a
man
who
has
only
the
former
will
always
be
at
fault
there
is
also
a
great
difference
between
conducting
canoes
on
lakes
and
along
a
river
and
navigating
ships
with
troops
on
distant
oceans
while
beaujeu
was
complaining
of
la
salle
his
followers
were
deserting
him
it
was
necessary
to
send
them
on
board
ship
and
keep
them
there
for
there
were
french
buccaneers
at
petit
goave
who
painted
the
promised
land
in
such
dismal
colors
that
many
of
the
adventurers
completely
lost
heart
some
too
were
dying
the
air
of
this
place
is
bad
says
joutel
so
are
the
fruits
and
there
are
plenty
of
women
worse
than
either
it
was
near
the
end
of
november
before
la
salle
could
resume
the
voyage
he
was
told
that
beaujeu
had
said
that
he
would
not
wait
longer
for
the
aimable
and
that
she
might
follow
as
she
could
moreover
la
salle
was
on
ill
terms
with
aigron
her
captain
who
had
declared
that
he
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
fearing
therefore
that
some
mishap
might
befall
her
he
resolved
to
embark
in
her
himself
with
his
brother
cavelier
membré
douay
and
others
the
trustiest
of
his
followers
on
the
they
set
sail
the
joly
and
the
little
frigate
belle
following
they
coasted
the
shore
of
cuba
and
landed
at
the
isle
of
pines
where
la
salle
shot
an
alligator
which
the
soldiers
ate
and
the
hunter
brought
in
a
wild
pig
half
of
which
he
sent
to
beaujeu
then
they
advanced
to
cape
antoine
where
bad
weather
and
contrary
winds
long
detained
them
a
load
of
cares
oppressed
the
mind
of
la
salle
pale
and
haggard
with
recent
illness
wrapped
within
his
own
thoughts
and
seeking
sympathy
from
none
sidenote
a
vain
search
at
length
they
entered
the
gulf
of
mexico
that
forbidden
sea
whence
by
a
spanish
decree
dating
from
the
reign
of
philip
all
foreigners
were
excluded
on
pain
of
extermination
not
a
man
on
board
knew
the
secrets
of
its
perilous
navigation
cautiously
feeling
their
way
they
held
a
course
till
on
the
of
december
a
sailor
at
the
of
the
aimable
saw
land
la
salle
and
all
the
pilots
had
been
led
to
form
an
exaggerated
idea
of
the
force
of
the
easterly
currents
and
they
therefore
supposed
themselves
near
the
bay
of
appalache
when
in
fact
they
were
much
farther
westward
on
new
year
day
they
anchored
three
leagues
from
the
shore
la
salle
with
the
engineer
minet
went
to
explore
it
and
found
nothing
but
a
vast
marshy
plain
studded
with
clumps
of
rushes
two
days
after
there
was
a
thick
fog
and
when
at
length
it
cleared
the
joly
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
la
salle
in
the
aimable
followed
closely
by
the
little
frigate
belle
stood
westward
along
the
coast
when
at
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
in
he
had
taken
its
latitude
but
unhappily
could
not
determine
its
longitude
and
now
every
eye
on
board
was
strained
to
detect
in
the
monotonous
lines
of
the
low
shore
some
tokens
of
the
great
river
in
fact
they
had
already
passed
it
on
the
sixth
of
january
a
wide
opening
was
descried
between
two
low
points
of
land
and
the
adjacent
sea
was
discolored
with
mud
la
salle
writes
his
brother
cavelier
has
always
thought
that
this
was
the
mississippi
to
all
appearance
it
was
the
entrance
of
galveston
bay
but
why
did
he
not
examine
it
joutel
says
that
his
attempts
to
do
so
were
frustrated
by
the
objections
of
the
pilot
of
the
aimable
to
which
with
a
facility
very
unusual
with
him
he
suffered
himself
to
yield
cavelier
declares
on
the
other
hand
that
he
would
not
enter
the
opening
because
he
was
afraid
of
missing
the
joly
but
he
might
have
entered
with
one
of
his
two
vessels
while
the
other
watched
outside
for
the
absent
ship
from
whatever
cause
he
lay
here
five
or
six
days
waiting
in
vain
for
beaujeu
till
at
last
thinking
that
he
must
have
passed
westward
he
resolved
to
follow
the
aimable
and
the
belle
again
spread
their
sails
and
coasted
the
shores
of
texas
joutel
with
a
boat
crew
tried
to
land
but
the
and
breakers
repelled
him
a
party
of
indians
swam
out
through
the
surf
and
were
taken
on
board
but
la
salle
could
learn
nothing
from
them
as
their
language
was
unknown
to
him
again
joutel
tried
to
land
and
again
the
breakers
repelled
him
he
approached
as
near
as
he
dared
and
saw
vast
plains
and
a
dim
expanse
of
forest
buffalo
running
with
their
heavy
gallop
along
the
shore
and
deer
grazing
on
the
marshy
meadows
sidenote
the
shores
of
texas
soon
after
he
succeeded
in
landing
at
a
point
somewhere
between
matagorda
island
and
corpus
christi
bay
the
aspect
of
the
country
was
not
cheering
with
its
barren
plains
its
reedy
marshes
its
interminable
and
broad
flats
of
mud
bare
at
low
tide
joutel
and
his
men
sought
in
vain
for
fresh
water
and
after
shooting
some
geese
and
ducks
returned
to
the
aimable
nothing
had
been
seen
of
beaujeu
and
the
joly
the
coast
was
trending
southward
and
la
salle
convinced
that
he
must
have
passed
the
missing
ship
turned
to
retrace
his
course
he
had
sailed
but
a
few
miles
when
the
wind
failed
a
fog
covered
the
sea
and
he
was
forced
to
anchor
opposite
one
of
the
openings
into
the
lagoons
north
of
mustang
island
at
length
on
the
nineteenth
there
came
a
faint
breeze
the
mists
rolled
away
before
it
and
to
his
great
joy
he
saw
the
joly
approaching
his
joy
says
joutel
was
short
beaujeu
lieutenant
aire
came
on
board
to
charge
him
with
having
caused
the
separation
and
la
salle
retorted
by
throwing
the
blame
on
beaujeu
then
came
a
debate
as
to
their
position
the
priest
esmanville
was
present
and
reports
that
la
salle
seemed
greatly
perplexed
he
had
more
cause
for
perplexity
than
he
knew
for
in
his
ignorance
of
the
longitude
of
the
mississippi
he
had
sailed
more
than
four
hundred
miles
beyond
it
of
this
he
had
not
the
faintest
suspicion
in
full
sight
from
his
ship
lay
a
reach
of
those
vast
lagoons
which
separated
from
the
sea
by
narrow
strips
of
land
line
this
coast
with
little
interruption
from
galveston
bay
to
the
rio
grande
the
idea
took
possession
of
him
that
the
mississippi
discharged
itself
into
these
lagoons
and
thence
made
its
way
to
the
sea
through
the
various
openings
he
had
seen
along
the
coast
chief
among
which
was
that
he
had
discovered
on
the
sixth
about
fifty
leagues
from
the
place
where
he
now
was
sidenote
perplexity
of
la
salle
yet
he
was
full
of
doubt
as
to
what
he
should
do
four
days
after
rejoining
beaujeu
he
wrote
him
the
strange
request
to
land
the
troops
that
he
might
fulfil
his
commission
that
is
that
he
might
set
out
against
the
spaniards
more
than
a
week
passed
a
gale
had
set
in
and
nothing
was
done
then
la
salle
wrote
again
intimating
some
doubt
as
to
whether
he
was
really
at
one
of
the
mouths
of
the
mississippi
and
saying
that
being
sure
that
he
had
passed
the
principal
mouth
he
was
determined
to
go
back
to
look
for
it
meanwhile
beaujeu
was
in
a
state
of
great
irritation
the
weather
was
stormy
and
the
coast
was
dangerous
supplies
were
scanty
and
la
salle
soldiers
still
crowded
in
the
joly
were
consuming
the
provisions
of
the
ship
beaujeu
gave
vent
to
his
annoyance
and
la
salle
retorted
in
the
same
strain
according
to
joutel
he
urged
the
naval
commander
to
sail
back
in
search
of
the
river
and
beaujeu
refused
unless
la
salle
should
give
the
soldiers
provisions
la
salle
he
adds
offered
to
supply
them
with
rations
for
fifteen
days
and
beaujeu
declared
this
insufficient
there
is
reason
however
to
believe
that
the
request
was
neither
made
by
the
one
nor
refused
by
the
other
so
positively
as
here
appears

this
taken

with

this

was
or
thirty
leagues
northeast
from

shows
that
it
can
have
been
no
other
than
the
entrance
of
galveston
bay
mistaken
by
him
for
the
chief
outlet
of
the

it
is
evident
that
he
imagined
galveston
bay
to
form
a
part
of
the
chain
of

from
which
it
is

advances
of
beaujeu
his
a
fatal
discovery
impatience
to
rid
himself
of
his
colleague
and
to
command
alone
no
doubt
had
its
influence
on
the
judgment
of
la
salle
he
presently
declared
that
he
would
land
the
soldiers
and
send
them
along
shore
till
they
came
to
the
principal
outlet
of
the
river
on
this
the
engineer
minet
took
up
the
word
expressed
his
doubts
as
to
whether
the
mississippi
discharged
itself
into
the
lagoons
at
all
represented
that
even
if
it
did
the
soldiers
would
be
exposed
to
great
risks
and
gave
as
his
opinion
that
all
should
reimbark
and
continue
the
search
in
company
the
advice
was
good
but
la
salle
resented
it
as
coming
from
one
in
whom
he
recognized
no
right
to
give
it
he
treated
me
complains
the
engineer
as
if
i
were
the
meanest
of
mankind
he
persisted
in
his
purpose
and
sent
joutel
and
moranget
with
a
party
of
soldiers
to
explore
the
coast
they
made
their
way
northeastward
along
the
shore
of
matagorda
island
till
they
were
stopped
on
the
third
day
by
what
joutel
calls
a
river
but
which
was
in
fact
the
entrance
of
matagorda
bay
here
they
encamped
and
tried
to
make
a
raft
of
the
difficulty
was
says
joutel
our
great
number
of
men
and
the
few
of
them
who
were
fit
for
anything
except
eating
as
i
said
before
they
had
all
been
caught
by
force
or
surprise
so
that
our
company
was
like
noah
ark
which
contained
animals
of
all
sorts
before
their
raft
was
finished
they
descried
to
their
great
joy
the
ships
which
had
followed
them
along
the
coast

la

and
announced
that
here
was
the
western
mouth
of
the
mississippi
and
the
place
to
which
the
king
had
sent
him
he
said
further
that
he
would
land
all
his
men
and
bring
the
aimable
and
the
belle
to
the
safe
harborage
within
beaujeu
remonstrated
alleging
the
shallowness
of
the
water
and
the
force
of
the
currents
but
his
remonstrance
was
vain
the
bay
of
louis
now
matagorda

forms
a
broad
and

harbor
accessible
from
the
sea
by
a
narrow
passage
obstructed
by
and
by
the
small
island
now
called
pelican

boats
were
sent
to
sound
and
buoy
out
the
channel
and
this
was
successfully
accomplished
on
the
sixteenth
of
february
the

was
ordered
to
enter
and
on
the
twentieth
she
weighed
anchor
la
salle
was
on
shore
watching
her
a
party
of
men
at
a
little
distance
were
cutting
down
a
tree
to
make
a
canoe
suddenly
some
of
them
ran
towards
him
with
terrified
faces
crying
out
that
they
had
been
set
upon
by
a
troop
of
indians
who
had
seized
their
companions
and
carried
them
off
la
salle
ordered
those
about
him
to
take
their
arms
and
at
once
set
out
in
pursuit
he
overtook
the
indians
and
opened
a
parley
with
them
but
when
he
wished
to
reclaim
his
men
he
discovered
that
they
had
been
led
away
during
the
conference
to
the
indian
camp
a
league
and
a
half
distant
among
them
was
one
of
his
lieutenants
the
young
marquis
de
la
sablonnière
he
was
deeply
vexed
for
the
moment
was
critical
but
the
men
must
be
recovered
and
he
led
his
followers
in
haste
towards
the
camp
yet
he
could
not
refrain
from
turning
a
moment
to
watch
the
aimable
as
she
neared
the
shoals
and
he
remarked
with
deep
anxiety
to
joutel
who
was
with
him
that
if
she
held
that
course
she
would
soon
be
aground
sidenote
wreck
of
the
aimable
they
hurried
on
till
they
saw
the
indian
huts
about
fifty
of
them
and
covered
with
mats
and
hides
were
clustered
on
a
rising
ground
with
their
inmates
gathered
among
and
around
them
as
the
french
entered
the
camp
there
was
the
report
of
a
cannon
from
the
seaward
the
startled
savages
dropped
flat
with
terror
a
different
fear
seized
la
salle
for
he
knew
that
the
shot
was
a
signal
of
disaster
looking
back
he
saw
the
aimable
furling
her
sails
and
his
heart
sank
with
the
conviction
that
she
had
struck
upon
the
reef
smothering
his
distress
she
was
laden
with
all
the
stores
of
the
colony
he
pressed
forward
among
the
filthy
wigwams
whose
astonished
inmates
swarmed
about
the
band
of
armed
strangers
staring
between
curiosity
and
fear
la
salle
knew
those
with
whom
he
was
dealing
and
without
ceremony
entered
the
chief
lodge
with
his
followers
the
crowd
closed
around
them
naked
men
and
women
described
by
joutel
as
of
singular
ugliness
they
gave
buffalo
meat
and
dried
porpoise
to
the
unexpected
guests
but
la
salle
racked
with
anxiety
hastened
to
close
the
interview
and
having
without
difficulty
recovered
the
kidnapped
men
he
returned
to
the
beach
leaving
with
the
indians
as
usual
an
impression
of
and
respect
when
he
reached
the
shore
he
saw
his
worst
fears
realized
the
aimable
lay
careened
over
on
the
reef
hopelessly
aground
little
remained
but
to
endure
the
calamity
with
firmness
and
to
save
as
far
as
might
be
the
vessel
cargo
this
was
no
easy
task
the
boat
which
hung
at
her
stern
had
been
stove
in
it
is
said
by
design
beaujeu
sent
a
boat
from
the
joly
and
one
or
more
indian
pirogues
were
procured
la
salle
urged
on
his
men
with
stern
and
patient
energy
and
a
quantity
of
gunpowder
and
flour
was
safely
landed
but
now
the
wind
blew
fresh
from
the
sea
the
waves
began
to
rise
a
storm
came
on
the
vessel
rocking
to
and
fro
on
the
opened
along
her
side
and
the
ravenous
waves
were
strewn
with
her
treasures
when
the
confusion
was
at
its
height
a
troop
of
indians
came
down
to
the
shore
greedy
for
plunder
the
drum
was
beat
the
men
were
called
to
arms
la
salle
set
his
trustiest
followers
to
guard
the
gunpowder
in
fear
not
of
the
indians
alone
but
of
his
own
countrymen
on
that
lamentable
night
the
sentinels
walked
their
rounds
through
the
dreary
bivouac
among
the
casks
bales
and
boxes
which
the
sea
had
yielded
up
and
here
too
their
chief
held
his
drearier
vigil
encompassed
with
treachery
darkness
and
the
storm
not
only
la
salle
but
joutel
and
others
of
his
party
believed
that
the
wreck
of
the
aimable
was
intentional
aigron
who
commanded
her
had
disobeyed
orders
and
disregarded
signals
though
he
had
been
directed
to
tow
the
vessel
through
the
channel
he
went
in
under
sail
and
though
little
else
was
saved
from
the
wreck
his
personal
property
including
even
some
preserved
fruits
was
all
landed
safely
he
had
long
been
on
ill
terms
with
la
salle
all
la
salle
company
were
now
encamped
on
the
sands
at
the
left
side
of
the
inlet
where
the
aimable
was
wrecked
they
were
all
says
the
engineer
minet
sick
with
nausea
and
dysentery
five
or
six
died
every
day
in
consequence
of
brackish
water
and
bad
food
there
was
no
grass
but
plenty
of
rushes
and
plenty
of
oysters
there
was
nothing
to
make
ovens
so
that
they
had
to
eat
flour
saved
from
the
wreck
boiled
into
messes
of
porridge
with
this
brackish
water
along
the
shore
were
quantities
of
uprooted
trees
and
rotten
logs
thrown
up
by
the
sea
and
the
lagoon
of
these
and
fragments
of
the
wreck
they
made
a
sort
of
rampart
to
protect
their
camp
and
here
among
tents
and
hovels
bales
boxes
casks
spars
dismounted
cannon
and
pens
for
fowls
and
swine
were
gathered
the
dejected
men
and
homesick
women
who
were
to
seize
new
biscay
and
hold
for
france
a
region
large
as
half
europe
the
spaniards
whom
they
were
to
conquer
were
they
knew
not
where
they
knew
not
where
they
were
themselves
and
for
the
fifteen
thousand
indian
allies
who
were
to
have
joined
them
they
found
two
hundred
squalid
savages
more
like
enemies
than
friends
in
fact
it
was
soon
made
plain
that
these
their
neighbors
wished
them
no
good
a
few
days
after
the
wreck
the
prairie
was
seen
on
fire
as
the
smoke
and
flame
rolled
towards
them
before
the
wind
la
salle
caused
all
the
grass
about
the
camp
to
be
cut
and
carried
away
and
especially
around
the
spot
where
the
powder
was
placed
the
danger
was
averted
but
it
soon
became
known
that
the
indians
had
stolen
a
number
of
blankets
and
other
articles
and
carried
them
to
their
wigwams
unwilling
to
leave
his
camp
la
salle
sent
his
nephew
moranget
and
several
other
volunteers
with
a
party
of
men
to
reclaim
them
they
went
up
the
bay
in
a
boat
landed
at
the
indian
camp
and
with
more
mettle
than
discretion
marched
into
it
sword
in
hand
the
indians
ran
off
and
the
rash
adventurers
seized
upon
several
canoes
as
an
equivalent
for
the
stolen
goods
not
knowing
how
to
manage
them
they
made
slow
progress
on
their
way
back
and
were
overtaken
by
night
before
reaching
the
french
camp
they
landed
made
a
fire
placed
a
sentinel
and
lay
down
on
the
dry
grass
to
sleep
the
sentinel
followed
their
example
when
suddenly
they
were
awakened
by
the
and
a
shower
of
arrows
two
volunteers
oris
and
desloges
were
killed
on
the
spot
a
third
named
gayen
was
severely
wounded
and
young
moranget
received
an
arrow
through
the
arm
he
leaped
up
and
fired
his
gun
at
the
vociferous
but
invisible
foe
others
of
the
party
did
the
same
and
the
indians
fled
sidenote
beaujeu
and
la
salle
it
was
about
this
time
that
beaujeu
prepared
to
return
to
france
he
had
accomplished
his
mission
and
landed
his
passengers
at
what
la
salle
assured
him
to
be
one
of
the
mouths
of
the
mississippi
his
ship
was
in
danger
on
this
exposed
and
perilous
coast
and
he
was
anxious
to
find
shelter
for
some
time
past
his
relations
with
la
salle
had
been
amicable
and
it
was
agreed
between
them
that
beaujeu
should
stop
at
galveston
bay
the
supposed
chief
mouth
of
the
mississippi
or
failing
to
find
harborage
here
that
he
should
proceed
to
mobile
bay
and
wait
there
till
april
to
hear
from
his
colleague
two
days
before
the
wreck
of
the
aimable
he
wrote
to
la
salle
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
you
would
have
more
confidence
in
me
for
my
part
i
will
always
make
the
first
advances
and
i
will
follow
your
counsel
whenever
i
can
do
so
without
risking
my
ship
i
will
come
back
to
this
place
if
you
want
to
know
the
results
of
the
voyage
i
am
going
to
make
if
you
wish
i
will
go
to
martinique
for
provisions
and
reinforcements
in
fine
there
is
nothing
i
am
not
ready
to
do
you
have
only
to
speak
la
salle
had
begged
him
to
send
ashore
a
number
of
cannon
and
a
quantity
of
iron
stowed
in
the
joly
for
the
use
of
the
colony
and
beaujeu
replies
i
wish
very
much
that
i
could
give
you
your
iron
but
it
is
impossible
except
in
a
harbor
for
it
is
on
my
ballast
and
under
your
cannon
my
spare
anchors
and
all
my
stowage
it
would
take
three
days
to
get
it
out
which
can
not
be
done
in
this
place
where
the
sea
runs
like
mountains
when
the
slightest
wind
blows
outside
i
would
rather
come
back
to
give
it
to
you
in
case
you
do
not
send
the
to
baye
du
esprit
mobile
bay
to
get
it
i
beg
you
once
more
to
consider
the
offer
i
make
you
to
go
to
martinique
to
get
provisions
for
your
people
i
will
ask
the
intendant
for
them
in
your
name
and
if
they
are
refused
i
will
take
them
on
my
own
account
to
this
la
salle
immediately
replied
i
received
with
singular
pleasure
the
letter
you
took
the
trouble
to
write
me
for
i
found
in
it
extraordinary
proofs
of
kindness
in
the
interest
you
take
in
the
success
of
an
affair
which
i
have
the
more
at
heart
as
it
involves
the
glory
of
the
king
and
the
honor
of
monseigneur
de
seignelay
i
have
done
my
part
towards
a
perfect
understanding
between
us
and
have
never
been
wanting
in
confidence
but
even
if
i
could
be
so
the
offers
you
make
are
so
obliging
that
they
would
inspire
complete
trust
he
nevertheless
declines
them
assuring
beaujeu
at
the
same
time
that
he
has
reached
the
place
he
sought
and
is
in
a
fair
way
of
success
if
he
can
but
have
the
cannon
cannonballs
and
iron
stowed
on
board
the
joly
directly
after
he
writes
again
i
can
not
help
conjuring
you
once
more
to
try
to
give
us
the
iron
beaujeu
replies
to
show
you
how
ardently
i
wish
to
contribute
to
the
success
of
your
undertaking
i
have
ordered
your
iron
to
be
got
out
in
spite
of
my
officers
and
sailors
who
tell
me
that
i
endanger
my
ship
by
moving
everything
in
the
depth
of
the
hold
on
a
coast
like
this
where
the
seas
are
like
mountains
i
hesitated
to
disturb
my
stowage
not
so
much
to
save
trouble
as
because
no
ballast
is
to
be
got
hereabout
and
i
have
therefore
had
six
cannon
from
my
lower
deck
battery
let
down
into
the
hold
to
take
the
place
of
the
iron
and
he
again
urges
la

to
accept
his
offer
to
bring
provisions
to
the
colonists
from
martinique
sidenote
departure
of
beaujeu
on
the
next
day
the
aimable
was
wrecked
beaujeu
remained
a
fortnight
longer
on
the
coast
and
then
told
la
salle
that
being
out
of
wood
water
and
other
necessaries
he
must
go
to
mobile
bay
to
get
them
nevertheless
he
lingered
a
week
more
repeated
his
offer
to
bring
supplies
from
martinique
which
la
salle
again
refused
and
at
last
set
sail
on
the
twelfth
of
march
after
a
which
was
courteous
on
both
sides
la
salle
and
his
colonists
were
left
alone
several
of
them
had
lost
heart
and
embarked
for
home
with
beaujeu
among
these
was
minet
the
engineer
who
had
fallen
out
with
la
salle
and
who
when
he
reached
france
was
imprisoned
for
deserting
him
even
his
brother
the
priest
jean
cavelier
had
a
mind
to
abandon
the
enterprise
but
was
persuaded
at
last
to
remain
along
with
his
nephew
the
moranget
and
the
younger
cavelier
a
mere
the
two
récollet
friars
zenobe

the
trusty

a
man
of
sense
and
observation
and
the
marquis
de

a
debauched
noble
whose
patrimony
was
his
sword
were
now
the
chief
persons
of
the
forlorn
company
the
rest
were
soldiers
raw
and
undisciplined
and
artisans
most
of
whom
knew
nothing
of
their
vocation
add
to
these
the
miserable
families
and
the
infatuated
young
women
who
had
come
to
tempt
fortune
in
the
swamps
and
of
the
mississippi
la
salle
set
out
to
explore
the
neighborhood
joutel
remained
in
command
of
the
fort
he
was
beset
with
wily
enemies
and
often
at
night
the
indians
would
crawl
in
the
grass
around
his
feeble
stockade
howling
like
wolves
but
a
few
shots
would
put
them
to
flight
a
strict
guard
was
kept
and
a
wooden
horse
was
set
in
the
enclosure
to
punish
the
sentinel
who
should
sleep
at
his
post
they
stood
in
daily
fear
of
a
more
formidable
foe
and
once
they
saw
a
sail
which
they
doubted
not
was
spanish
but
she
happily
passed
without
discovering
them
they
hunted
on
the
prairies
and
speared
fish
in
the
neighboring
pools
on
easter
day
the
sieur
le
gros
one
of
the
chief
men
of
the
company
went
out
after
the
service
to
shoot
snipes
but
as
he
walked
barefoot
through
the
marsh
a
snake
bit
him
and
he
soon
after
died
two
men
deserted
to
starve
on
the
prairie
or
to
become
savages
among
savages
others
tried
to
escape
but
were
caught
and
one
of
them
was
hung
a
knot
of
desperadoes
conspired
to
kill
joutel
but
one
of
them
betrayed
the
secret
and
the
plot
was
crushed
la
salle
returned
from
his
exploration
but
his
return
brought
no
cheer
he
had
been
forced
to
renounce
the
illusion
to
which
he
had
clung
so
long
and
was
convinced
at
last
that
he
was
not
at
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
the
wreck
of
the
aimable
itself
was
not
pregnant
with
consequences
so
disastrous
sidenote
conduct
of
beaujeu
the
conduct
of
beaujeu
hitherto
judged
chiefly
by
the
printed
narrative
of
joutel
is
set
in
a
new
and
more
favorable
light
by
his
correspondence
with
la
salle
whatever
may
have
been
their
mutual
irritation
it
is
clear
that
the
naval
commander
was
anxious
to
discharge
his
duty
in
a
manner
to
satisfy
seignelay
and
that
he
may
be
wholly
acquitted
of
any
sinister
design
when
he
left
la
salle
on
the
twelfth
of
march
he
meant
to
sail
in
search
of
the
bay
of
mobile
baye
du
esprit
partly
because
he
hoped
to
find
it
a
safe
harbor
where
he
could
get
la
salle
cannon
out
of
the
hold
and
find
ballast
to
take
their
place
and
partly
to
get
a
supply
of
wood
and
water
of
which
he
was
in
extreme
need
he
told
la
salle
that
he
would
wait
there
till
the
middle
of
april
in
order
that
he
la
salle
might
send
the
belle
to
receive
the
cannon
but
on
this
point
there
was
no
definite
agreement
between
them
beaujeu
was
ignorant
of
the
position
of
the
bay
which
he
thought
much
nearer
than
it
actually
was
after
trying
two
days
to
reach
it
the
strong
and
the
discontent
of
his
crew
induced
him
to
bear
away
for
cuba
and
after
an
encounter
with
pirates
and
various
adventures
he
reached
france
about
the
first
of
july
he
was
coldly
received
by
seignelay
who
wrote
to
the
intendant
at
rochelle
his
majesty
has
seen
what
you
wrote
about
the
idea
of
the
sieur
de
beaujeu
that
the
sieur
de
la
salle
is
not
at
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
he
seems
to
found
this
belief
on
such
weak
conjectures
that
no
great
attention
need
be
given
to
his
account
especially
as
has
been
prejudiced
from
the
first
against
la

the

at
the
same
time
warns
beaujeu
to
say
nothing
in
disparagement
of
the

of

displeasure

narrative
of
the

sufficiently
explains
a

on

the

farewell
of
what
avail
to
plant
a
colony
by
the
mouth
of
a
petty
texan
river
the
mississippi
was
the
life
of
the
enterprise
the
condition
of
its
growth
and
of
its
existence
without
it
all
was
futile
and
meaningless
a
folly
and
a
ruin
cost
what
it
might
the
mississippi
must
be
found
but
the
demands
of
the
hour
were
imperative
the
hapless
colony
cast
ashore
like
a
wreck
on
the
sands
of
matagorda
bay
must
gather
up
its
shattered
resources
and
recruit
its
exhausted
strength
before
it
essayed
anew
its
pilgrimage
to
the
fatal
river
la
salle
during
his
explorations
had
found
a
spot
which
he
thought
well
fitted
for
a
temporary
establishment
it
was
on
the
river
which
he
named
the
la
vache
now
the
lavaca
which
enters
the
head
of
matagorda
bay
and
thither
he
ordered
all
the
women
and
children
and
most
of
the
men
to
remove
while
the
rest
thirty
in
number
remained
with
joutel
at
the
fort
near
the
mouth
of
the
bay
here
they
spent
their
time
in
hunting
fishing
and
squaring
the
logs
of
which
the
sea
washed
up
in
abundance
and
which
la
salle
proposed
to
use
in
building
his
new
station
on
the
lavaca
thus
the
time
passed
till
midsummer
when
joutel
received
orders
to
abandon
his
post
and
rejoin
the
main
body
of
the
colonists
to
this
end
the
little
frigate
belle
was
sent
down
the
bay
she
was
a
gift
from
the
king
to
la
salle
who
had
brought
her
safely
over
the
bar
and
regarded
her
as
a
of
his
hopes
she
now
took
on
board
the
stores
and
some
of
the
men
while
joutel
with
the
rest
followed
along
shore
to
the
post
on
the
lavaca
here
he
found
a
state
of
things
that
was
far
from
cheering
crops
had
been
sown
but
the
drought
and
the
cattle
had
nearly
destroyed
them
the
colonists
were
lodged
under
tents
and
hovels
and
the
only
solid
structure
was
a
small
square
enclosure
of
pickets
in
which
the
gunpowder
and
the
brandy
were
stored
the
site
was
good
a
rising
ground
by
the
river
but
there
was
no
wood
within
the
distance
of
a
league
and
no
horses
or
oxen
to
drag
it
their
work
must
be
done
by
men
some
felled
and
squared
the
timber
and
others
dragged
it
by
main
force
over
the
matted
grass
of
the
prairie
under
the
scorching
texan
sun
the
served
to
make
the
task
somewhat
easier
yet
the
strongest
men
soon
gave
out
under
it
joutel
went
down
to
the
first
fort
made
a
raft
and
brought
up
the
timber
collected
there
which
proved
a
most
seasonable
and
useful
supply
palisades
and
buildings
began
to
rise
the
men
labored
without
spirit
yet
strenuously
for
they
labored
under
the
eye
of
la
salle
the
carpenters
brought
from
rochelle
proved
worthless
and
he
himself
made
the
plans
of
the
work
marked
out
the
tenons
and
mortises
and
directed
the
whole
sidenote
misery
and
dejection
death
meanwhile
made
withering
havoc
among
his
followers
and
under
the
sheds
and
hovels
that
shielded
them
from
the
sun
lay
a
score
of
wretches
slowly
wasting
away
with
the
diseases
contracted
at
domingo
of
the
soldiers
enlisted
for
the
expedition
by
la
agents
many
are
affirmed
to
have
spent
their
lives
in
begging
at
the
church
doors
of
rochefort
and
were
consequently
incapable
of
discipline
it
was
impossible
to
prevent
either
them
or
the
sailors
from
devouring
persimmons
and
other
wild
fruits
to
a
destructive
excess
nearly
all
fell
ill
and
before
the
summer
had
passed
the
graveyard
had
more
than
thirty
tenants
the
bearing
of
la
salle
did
not
aid
to
raise
the
drooping
spirits
of
his
followers
the
results
of
the
enterprise
had
been
far
different
from
his
hopes
and
after
a
season
of
flattering
promise
he
had
entered
again
on
those
dark
and
obstructed
paths
which
seemed
his
destined
way
of
life
the
present
was
beset
with
trouble
the
future
thick
with
storms
the
consciousness
quickened
his
energies
but
it
made
him
stern
harsh
and
often
unjust
to
those
beneath
him
joutel
was
returning
to
camp
one
afternoon
with
the
when
they
saw
game
and
the
carpenter
went
after
it
he
was
never
seen
again
perhaps
he
was
lost
on
the
prairie
perhaps
killed
by

knew
little
of
his

nevertheless

as

repeatedly
calls
it
before

he
made
some
preliminary
explorations
in
the
course
of
which
according
to
the
report
of
his

the

he
found
evidence
that

about
fifteen

from

with
fifty

some
of

wore

pursued
their
course
eastward
on

along
the
margin
of
the

while
joutel
remained
in
command
of
the
fort
it
was
two
leagues
above
the
mouth
of
the

and
in
it
were
persons
including
three

a

as

does
not

to
inform

passed
their
time
in
wallowing
in
the
ditch
of
the
palisade
a
cock
and
hen
with
a
young
family
and
a
pair
of

which
in
a
temporary
dearth
of
fresh
meat
were
sacrificed
to

no

the

were
built
for
the

for

a
small
chapel
was
afterwards
added
and
the

was
fenced
with
a
palisade
at
the
four
corners
of

were
mounted
eight
pieces
of
cannon
which
in
the
absence
of

were
loaded
with
bags
of
bullets
between
the
palisades
and
the
stream
lay
a
narrow
strip
of
marsh
the
haunt
of
countless
birds
and
at
a
little
distance
it
deepened
into

full
of

swarmed
with

their
log
canoes
into
the
water
wading
shoeless
through
the
deep
tenacious
mud
the
sharp
shells
would
cut
their
feet
like
knives
and
what
was
worse
says
joutel
the
salt
water
came
into
the
gashes
and
made
them
smart
atrociously
he
sometimes
amused
himself
with
shooting
alligators
i
never
spared
them
when
i
met
them
near
the
house
one
day
i
killed
an
extremely
large
one
which
was
nearly
four
feet
and
a
half
in
girth
and
about
twenty
feet
long
he
describes
with
accuracy
that
curious
native
of
the
southwestern
plains
the
horned
frog
which
deceived
by
its
uninviting
appearance
he
erroneously
supposed
to
be
venomous
we
had
some
of
our
animals
bitten
by
snakes
among
the
others
a
bitch
that
had
belonged
to
the
deceased
sieur
le
gros
she
was
bitten
in
the
jaw
when
she
was
with
me
as
i
was
fishing
by
the
shore
of
the
bay
i
gave
her
a
little
theriac
an
antidote
then
in
vogue
which
cured
her
as
it
did
one
of
our
sows
which
came
home
one
day
with
her
head
so
swelled
that
she
could
hardly
hold
it
up
thinking
it
must
be
some
snake
that
had
bitten
her
i
gave
her
a
dose
of
the
theriac
mixed
with
meal
and
water
the
patient
began
to
mend
at
once
i
killed
a
good
many
by
means
of
the
aforesaid
bitch
for
when
she
saw
one
she
would
bark
around
him
sometimes
for
a
half
hour
together
till
i
took
my
gun
and
shot
him
i
often
found
them
in
the
bushes
making
a
noise
with
their
tails
when
i
had
killed
them
our
hogs
ate
them
he
devotes
many
pages
to
the
plants
and
animals
of
the
neighborhood
most
of
which
may
easily
be
recognized
from
his
description
sidenote
the
buffalo
with
the
buffalo
which
he
calls
our
daily
bread
his
experiences
were
many
and
strange
being
like
the
rest
of
the
party
a
novice
in
the
art
of
shooting
them
he
met
with
many
disappointments
once
having
mounted
to
the
roof
of
the
large
house
in
the
fort
he
saw
a
dark
moving
object
on
a
swell
of
the
prairie
three
miles
off
and
rightly
thinking
that
it
was
a
herd
of
buffalo
he
set
out
with
six
or
seven
men
to
try
to
kill
some
of
them
after
a
while
he
discovered
two
bulls
lying
in
a
hollow
and
signing
to
the
rest
of
his
party
to
keep
quiet
he
made
his
approach
gun
in
hand
the
bulls
presently
jumped
up
and
stared
through
their
manes
at
the
intruder
joutel
fired
it
was
a
close
shot
but
the
bulls
merely
shook
their
shaggy
heads
wheeled
about
and
galloped
heavily
away
the
same
luck
attended
him
the
next
day
we
saw
plenty
of
buffalo
i
approached
several
bands
of
them
and
fired
again
and
again
but
could
not
make
one
of
them
fall
he
had
not
yet
learned
that
a
buffalo
rarely
falls
at
once
unless
hit
in
the
spine
he
continues
i
was
not
discouraged
and
after
approaching
several
more
bands
which
was
hard
work
because
i
had
to
crawl
on
the
ground
so
as
not
to
be
seen
i
found
myself
in
a
herd
of
five
or
six
thousand
but
to
my
great
vexation
i
could
not
bring
one
of
them
down
they
all
ran
off
to
the
right
and
left
it
was
near
night
and
i
had
killed
nothing
though
i
was
very
tired
i
tried
again
approached
another
band
and
fired
a
number
of
shots
but
not
a
buffalo
would
fall
the
skin
was
off
my
knees
with
crawling
at
last
as
i
was
going
back
to
rejoin
our
men
i
saw
a
buffalo
lying
on
the
ground
i
went
towards
it
and
saw
that
it
was
dead
i
examined
it
and
found
that
the
bullet
had
gone
in
near
the
shoulder
then
i
found
others
dead
like
the
first
i
beckoned
the
men
to
come
on
and
we
set
to
work
to
cut
up
the
meat
a
task
which
was
new
to
us
all
it
would
be
impossible
to
write
a
more
true
and
characteristic
sketch
of
the
experience
of
a
novice
in
shooting
buffalo
on
foot
a
few
days
after
he
went
out
again
with
father
anastase
douay
approached
a
bull
fired
and
broke
his
shoulder
the
bull
hobbled
off
on
three
legs
douay
ran
in
his
cassock
to
head
him
back
while
joutel
reloaded
his
gun
upon
which
the
enraged
beast
butted
at
the
missionary
and
knocked
him
down
he
very
narrowly
escaped
with
his
life
there
was
another
missionary
pursues
joutel
named
father
maxime
le
clerc
who
was
very
well
fitted
for
such
an
undertaking
as
ours
because
he
was
equal
to
anything
even
to
butchering
a
buffalo
and
as
i
said
before
that
every
one
of
us
must
lend
a
hand
because
we
were
too
few
for
anybody
to
be
waited
upon
i
made
the
women
girls
and
children
do
their
part
as
well
as
him
for
as
they
all
wanted
to
eat
it
was
fair
that
they
all
should
work
he
had
a
scaffolding
built
near
the
fort
and
set
them
to
smoking
buffalo
meat
against
a
day
of
scarcity
sidenote
return
of
duhaut
thus
the
time
passed
till
the
middle
of
january
when
late
one
evening
as
all
were
gathered
in
the
principal
building
conversing
perhaps
or
smoking
or
playing
at
cards
or
dozing
by
the
fire
in
homesick
dreams
of
france
a
man
on
guard
came
in
to
report
that
he
had
heard
a
voice
from
the
river
they
all
went
down
to
the
bank
and
descried
a
man
in
a
canoe
who
called
out
dominic
this
was
the
name
of
the
younger
of
the
two
brothers
duhaut
who
was
one
of
joutel
followers
as
the
canoe
approached
they
recognized
the
elder
who
had
gone
with
la
salle
on
his
journey
of
discovery
and
who
was
perhaps
the
greatest
villain
of
the
company
joutel
was
much
perplexed
la
salle
had
ordered
him
to
admit
nobody
into
the
fort
without
a
pass
and
a
watchword
duhaut
when
questioned
said
that
he
had
none
but
told
at
the
same
time
so
plausible
a
story
that
joutel
no
longer
hesitated
to
receive
him
as
la
salle
and
his
men
were
pursuing
their
march
along
the
prairie
duhaut
who
was
in
the
rear
had
stopped
to
mend
his
moccasins
and
when
he
tried
to
overtake
the
party
had
lost
his
way
mistaking
a
for
the
trail
of
his
companions
at
night
he
fired
his
gun
as
a
signal
but
there
was
no
answering
shot
seeing
no
hope
of
rejoining
them
he
turned
back
for
the
fort
found
one
of
the
canoes
which
la
salle
had
hidden
at
the
shore
paddled
by
night
and
lay
close
by
day
shot
turkeys
deer
and
buffalo
for
food
and
having
no
knife
cut
the
meat
with
a
sharp
flint
till
after
a
month
of
excessive
hardship
he
reached
his
destination
as
the
inmates
of
fort
louis
gathered
about
the
wanderer
he
told
them
dreary
tidings
the
pilot
of
the
belle
such
was
his
story
had
gone
with
five
men
to
sound
along
the
shore
by
order
of
la
salle
who
was
then
encamped
in
the
neighborhood
with
his
party
of
explorers
the
boat
crew
being
overtaken
by
the
night
had
rashly
bivouacked
on
the
beach
without
setting
a
guard
and
as
they
slept
a
band
of
indians
had
rushed
in
upon
them
and
butchered
them
all
la
salle
alarmed
by
their
long
absence
had
searched
along
the
shore
and
at
length
found
their
bodies
scattered
about
the
sands
and
by
wolves
well
would
it
have
been
if
duhaut
had
shared
their
fate
weeks
and
months
dragged
on
when
at
the
end
of
march
joutel
chancing
to
mount
on
the
roof
of
one
of
the
buildings
saw
seven
or
eight
men
approaching
over
the
prairie
he
went
out
to
meet
them
with
an
equal
number
well
armed
and
as
he
drew
near
recognized
with
mixed
joy
and
anxiety
la
salle
and
some
of
those
who
had
gone
with
him
his
brother
cavelier
was
at
his
side
with
his
cassock
so
tattered
that
says
joutel
there
was
hardly
a
piece
left
large
enough
to
wrap
a
worth
of
salt
he
had
an
old
cap
on
his
head
having
lost
his
hat
by
the
way
the
rest
were
in
no
better
plight
for
their
shirts
were
all
in
rags
some
of
them
carried
loads
of
meat
because
de
la
salle
was
afraid
that
we
might
not
have
killed
any
buffalo
we
met
with
great
joy
and
many
embraces
after
our
greetings
were
over
de
la
salle
seeing
duhaut
asked
me
in
an
angry
tone
how
it
was
that
i
had
received
this
man
who
had
abandoned
him
i
told
him
how
it
had
happened
and
repeated
duhaut
story
duhaut
defended
himself
and
de
la
salle
anger
was
soon
over
we
went
into
the
house
and
refreshed
ourselves
with
some
bread
and
brandy
as
there
was
no
wine
left
sidenote
la
salle
adventures
la
salle
and
his
companions
told
their
story
they
had
wandered
on
through
various
savage
tribes
with
whom
they
had
more
than
one
encounter
scattering
them
like
chaff
by
the
terror
of
their
at
length
they
found
a
more
friendly
band
and
learned
much
touching
the
spaniards
who
they
were
told
were
universally
hated
by
the
tribes
of
that
country
it
would
be
easy
said
their
informants
to
gather
a
host
of
warriors
and
lead
them
over
the
rio
grande
but
la
salle
was
in
no
condition
for
attempting
conquests
and
the
tribes
in
whose
alliance
he
had
trusted
had
a
few
days
before
been
at
blows
with
him
the
invasion
of
new
biscay
must
be
postponed
to
a
more
propitious
day
still
advancing
he
came
to
a
large
river
which
he
at
first
mistook
for
the
mississippi
and
building
a
fort
of
palisades
he
left
here
several
of
his
men
the
fate
of
these
unfortunates
does
not
appear
he
now
retraced
his
steps
towards
fort
louis
and
as
he
approached
it
detached
some
of
his
men
to
look
for
his
vessel
the
belle
for
whose
safety
since
the
loss
of
her
pilot
he
had
become
very
anxious
on
the
next
day
these
men
appeared
at
the
fort
with
downcast
looks
they
had
not
found
the
belle
at
the
place
where
she
had
been
ordered
to
remain
nor
were
any
tidings
to
be
heard
of
her
from
that
hour
the
conviction
that
she
was
lost
possessed
the
mind
of
la
salle
surrounded
as
he
was
and
had
always
been
with
traitors
the
belief
now
possessed
him
that
her
crew
had
abandoned
the
colony
and
made
sail
for
the
west
indies
or
for
france
the
loss
was
incalculable
he
had
relied
on
this
vessel
to
transport
the
colonists
to
the
mississippi
as
soon
as
its
exact
position
could
be
ascertained
and
thinking
her
a
safer
place
of
deposit
than
the
fort
he
had
put
on
board
of
her
all
his
papers
and
personal
baggage
besides
a
great
quantity
of
stores
ammunition
and
tools
in
truth
she
was
of
the
last
necessity
to
the
unhappy
exiles
and
their
only
resource
for
escape
from
a
position
which
was
fast
becoming
desperate
la

as
his
brother
tells
us
now
fell
dangerously
ill
the
fatigues
of
his
journey
joined
to
the
effects
upon
his
mind
of
this
last
disaster
having
overcome
his
strength
though
not
his
fortitude
in
truth
writes
the
priest
after
the
loss
of
the
vessel
which
deprived
us
of
our
only
means
of
returning
to
france
we
had
no
resource
but
in
the
firm
guidance
of
my
brother
whose
death
each
of
us
would
have
regarded
as
his
own
sidenote
departure
for
canada
la
salle
no
sooner
recovered
than
he
embraced
a
resolution
which
could
be
the
offspring
only
of
a
desperate
necessity
he
determined
to
make
his
way
by
the
mississippi
and
the
illinois
to
canada
whence
he
might
bring
succor
to
the
colonists
and
send
a
report
of
their
condition
to
france
the
attempt
was
beset
with
uncertainties
and
dangers
the
mississippi
was
first
to
be
found
then
followed
through
all
the
perilous
monotony
of
its
interminable
windings
to
a
goal
which
was
to
be
but
the
of
a
new
and
not
less
arduous
journey
cavelier
his
brother
moranget
his
nephew
the
friar
anastase

and
others
to
the
number
of
twenty
were
chosen
to
accompany
him
every
corner
of
the

was
ransacked
for
an
outfit
joutel
generously
gave
up
the
better
part
of
his
wardrobe
to

and
his
two
relatives

who
had
saved

of

his
weapons
some
with

slung
at
their
backs
some
with

some
with

for

in
this
guise
they
held
their
way
in
silence
across
the
prairie
while
anxious
eyes
followed
them
from
the
palisades
of
louis
whose
inmates
not
excepting
joutel
himself
seem
to
have
been
ignorant
of
the
extent

difficulty
of

sidenote
wreck
of
the
belle
on
may
day
he
writes
at
about
two
in
the
afternoon
as
i
was
walking
near
the
house
i
heard
a
voice
from
the
river
below
crying
out
several
times
vive
knowing
that
the
sieur
barbier
had
gone
that
way
with
two
canoes
to
hunt
buffalo
i
thought
that
it
might
be
one
of
these
canoes
coming
back
with
meat
and
did
not
think
much
of
the
matter
till
i
heard
the
same
voice
again
i
answered
which
was
the
password
i
had
given
the
sieur
barbier
in
case
he
should
come
back
in
the
night
but
as
i
was
going
towards
the
bank
i
heard
other
voices
which
i
had
not
heard
for
a
long
time
i
recognized
among
the
rest
that
of
chefdeville
which
made
me
fear
that
some
disaster
had
happened
i
ran
down
to
the
bank
and
my
first
greeting
was
to
ask
what
had
become
of
the
they
answered
that
she
was
wrecked
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
and
that
all
on
board
were
drowned
except
the
six
who
were
in
the
canoe
namely
the
sieur
chefdeville
the
marquis
de
la
sablonnière
the
man
named
teissier
a
soldier
a
girl
and
a
little
boy
from
the
young
priest
chefdeville
joutel
learned
the
particulars
of
the
disaster
water
had
failed
on
board
the
belle
a
boat
crew
of
five
men
had
gone
in
quest
of
it
the
wind
rose
their
boat
was
swamped
and
they
were
all
drowned
those
who
remained
had
now
no
means
of
going
ashore
but
if
they
had
no
water
they
had
wine
and
brandy
in
abundance
and
teissier
the
master
of
the
vessel
was
drunk
every
day
after
a
while
they
left
their
moorings
and
tried
to
reach
the
fort
but
they
were
few
weak
and
unskilful
a
violent
north
wind
drove
them
on
a
some
of
them
were
drowned
in
trying
to
reach
land
on
a
raft
others
were
more
successful
and
after
a
long
delay
they
found
a
stranded
canoe
in
which
they
made
their
way
to
louis
bringing
with
them
some
of
la
salle
papers
and
baggage
saved
from
the
wreck
these
multiplied
disasters
bore
hard
on
the
spirits
of
the
colonists
and
joutel
like
a
good
commander
as
he
was
spared
no
pains
to
cheer
them
we
did
what
we
could
to
amuse
ourselves
and
drive

i
encouraged
our
people
to
dance
and
sing
in
the
evenings
for
when

was
among
us
pleasure
was
often
banished
now
there
is
no
use
in
being
melancholy
on
such
occasions
it
is
true

had
no
great
cause
for
after
all
his
losses
and
disappointments
but
his
troubles
made
others
suffer
also
though
he
had
ordered
me
to
allow
to
each
person
only
a
certain
quantity
of
meat
at
every
meal
i
observed
this
rule
only
when
meat
was
rare
the
air
here
is
very
keen
and
one
has
a
great
appetite
one
must
eat
and
act
if
he
wants
good
health
and
spirits
i
speak
from
experience
for
once
when
i
had
ague
chills
and
was
obliged
to
keep
the
house
with
nothing
to
do
i
was
dreary
and
on
the
contrary
if
i
was
busy
with
hunting
or
anything
else
i
was
not
so
dull
by
half
so
i
tried
to
keep
the
people
as
busy
as
possible
i
set
them
to
making
a
small
cellar
to
keep
meat
fresh
in
hot
weather
but
when
de
la
salle
came
back
he
said
it
was
too
small
as
he
always
wanted
to
do
everything
on
a
grand
scale
he
prepared
to
make
a
large
one
and
marked
out
the
plan
this
plan
of
the
large
cellar
like
more
important
undertakings
of
its
unhappy
projector
proved
too
extensive
for
execution
the
colonists
being
engrossed
by
the
daily
care
of
keeping
themselves
alive
sidenote
matrimony
a
gleam
of
hilarity
shot
for
an
instant
out
of
the
clouds
the
young
canadian
barbier
usually
conducted
the
and
some
of
the
women
and
girls
often
went
out
with
them
to
aid
in
cutting
up
the
meat
barbier
became
enamoured
of
one
of
the
girls
and
as
his
devotion
to
her
was
the
subject
of
comment
he
asked
joutel
for
leave
to
marry
her
the
commandant
after
due
counsel
with
the
priests
and
friars
vouchsafed
his
consent
and
the
rite
was
duly
solemnized
whereupon
fired
by
the
example
the
marquis
de
la
sablonnière
begged
leave
to
marry
another
of
the
girls
joutel
the
gardener
son
concerned
that
a
marquis
should
so
abase
himself
and
anxious
at
the
same
time
for
the
morals
of
the
fort
which
la
salle
had
especially
commended
to
his
care
not
only
flatly
refused
but
in
the
plenitude
of
his
authority
forbade
the
lovers
all
further
intercourse
father
zenobe
membré
superior
of
the
mission
gave
unwilling
occasion
for
further
merriment
these
worthy
friars
were
singularly
unhappy
in
their
dealings
with
the
buffalo
one
of
which
it
may
be
remembered
had
already
knocked
down
father
anastase
undeterred
by
his
example
father
zenobe
one
day
went
out
with
the
hunters
carrying
a
gun
like
the
rest
joutel
shot
a
buffalo
which
was
making
off
badly
wounded
when
a
second
shot
stopped
it
and
it
presently
lay
down
the
father
superior
thought
it
was
dead
and
without
heeding
the
warning
shout
of
joutel
he
approached
and
pushed
it
with
the
butt
of
his
gun
the
bull
sprang
up
with
an
effort
of
expiring
fury
and
in
the
words
of
joutel
trampled
on
the
father
took
the
skin
off
his
face
in
several
places
and
broke
his
gun
so
that
he
could
hardly
manage
to
get
away
and
remained
in
an
almost
helpless
state
for
more
than
three
months
bad
as
the
accident
was
he
was
laughed
at
nevertheless
for
his
rashness
the
mishaps
of
the
friars
did
not
end
here
father
maxime
le
clerc
was
set
upon
by
a
boar
belonging
to
the
colony
i
do
not
know
says
joutel
what
spite
the
beast
had
against
him
whether
for
a
beating
or
some
other
offence
but
however
this
may
be
i
saw
the
father
running
and
crying
for
help
and
the
boar
running
after
him
i
went
to
the
rescue
but
could
not
come
up
in
time
the
father
stooped
as
he
ran
to
gather
up
his
cassock
from
about
his
legs
and
the
boar
which
ran
faster
than
he
struck
him
in
the
arm
with
his
tusks
so
that
some
of
the
nerves
were
torn
thus
all
three
of
our
good
récollet
fathers
were
near
being
the
victims
of
animals
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
encourage
them
the
followers
of
joutel
were
fast
losing
heart
father
maxime
le
clerc
kept
a
journal
in
which
he
set
down
various
charges
against
la
salle
joutel
got
possession
of
the
paper
and
burned
it
on
the
urgent
entreaty
of
the
friars
who
dreaded
what
might
ensue
should
the
absent
commander
become
aware
of
the
aspersions
cast
upon
him
the
elder
duhaut
fomented
the
rising
discontent
of
the
colonists
played
the
demagogue
told
them
that
la
salle
would
never
return
and
tried
to
make
himself
their
leader
joutel
detected
the
mischief
and
with
a
lenity
which
he
afterwards
deeply
regretted
contented
himself
with
a
rebuke
to
the
offender
and
words
of
reproof
and
encouragement
to
the
dejected
band
sidenote
adventures
of
the
travellers
he
had
caused
the
grass
to
be
cut
near
the
fort
so
as
to
form
a
sort
of
playground
and
here
one
evening
he
and
some
of
the
party
were
trying
to
amuse
themselves
when
they
heard
shouts
from
beyond
the
river
and
joutel
recognized
the
voice
of
la
salle
hastening
to
meet
him
in
a
wooden
canoe
he
brought
him
and
his
party
to
the
fort
twenty
men
had
gone
out
with
him
and
eight
had
returned
of
the
rest
four
had
deserted
one
had
been
lost
one
had
been
devoured
by
an
alligator
and
the
others
giving
out
on
the
march
had
probably
perished
in
attempting
to
regain
the
fort
the
travellers
told
of
a
rich
country
a
wild
and
beautiful
landscape
woods
rivers
groves
and
prairies
but
all
availed
nothing
and
the
acquisition
of
five
horses
was
but
an
indifferent
return
for
the
loss
of
twelve
men
after
leaving
the
fort
they
had
journeyed
towards
the
northeast
over
plains
green
as
an
emerald
with
the
young
verdure
of
april
till
at
length
they
saw
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
boundless
prairie
alive
with
herds
of
buffalo
the
animals
were
in
one
of
their
tame
or
stupid
moods
and
they
killed
nine
or
ten
of
them
without
the
least
difficulty
drying
the
best
parts
of
the
meat
they
crossed
the
colorado
on
a
raft
and
reached
the
banks
of
another
river
where
one
of
the
party
named
hiens
a
german
of
würtemberg
and
an
old
buccaneer
was
mired
and
nearly
suffocated
in
a
unfortunately
as
will
soon
appear
he
managed
to
crawl
out
and
to
console
him
the
river
was
christened
with
his
name
the
party
made
a
bridge
of
felled
trees
on
which
they
crossed
in
safety
la
salle
now
changed
their
course
and
journeyed
eastward
when
the
travellers
soon
found
themselves
in
the
midst
of
a
numerous
indian
population
where
they
were
feasted
and
caressed
without
measure
at
another
village
they
were
less
fortunate
the
inhabitants
were
friendly
by
day
and
hostile
by
night
they
came
to
attack
the
french
in
their
camp
but
withdrew
daunted
by
the
menacing
voice
of
la
salle
who
had
heard
them
approaching
through
the
la
salle
favorite
shawanoe
hunter
nika
who
had
followed
him
from
canada
to
france
and
from
france
to
texas
was
bitten
by
a
rattlesnake
and
though
he
recovered
the
accident
detained
the
party
for
several
days
at
length
they
resumed
their
journey
but
were
stopped
by
a
river
called
by
douay
la
rivière
des
malheurs
la
salle
and
cavelier
with
a
few
others
tried
to
cross
on
a
raft
which
as
it
reached
the
channel
was
caught
by
a
current
of
marvellous
swiftness
douay
and

watching
the
transit
from
the
edge
of
the
beheld
their
commander
swept
down
the
stream
and
vanishing
as
it
were
in
an
instant
all
that
day
they
remained
with
their
companions
on
the
bank
lamenting
in
despair
for
the
loss
of
their
guardian
angel
for
so
douay
calls
la
salle
it
was
fast
growing
dark
when
to
their
unspeakable
relief
they
saw
him
advancing
with
his
party
along
the
opposite
bank
having
succeeded
after
great
exertion
in
guiding
the
raft
to
land
how
to
rejoin
him
was
now
the
question
douay
and
his
companions
who
had
tasted
no
food
that
day
broke
their
fast
on
two
young
eagles
which
they
knocked
out
of
their
nest
and
then
spent
the
night
in
rueful
consultation
as
to
the
means
of
crossing
the
river
in
the
morning
they
waded
into
the
marsh
the
friar
with
his
breviary
in
his
hood
to
keep
it
dry
and
hacked
among
the
canes
till
they
had
gathered
enough
to
make
another
raft
on
which
profiting
by
la
experience
they
safely
crossed
and
rejoined
him
next
they
became
entangled
in
a
where
la
salle
as
usual
with
him
in
such
cases
took
the
lead
a
hatchet
in
each
hand
and
hewed
out
a
path
for
his
followers
they
soon
reached
the
villages
of
the
cenis
indians
on
and
near
the
river
trinity
a
tribe
then
powerful
but
long
since
extinct
nothing
could
surpass
the
friendliness
of
their
welcome
the
chiefs
came
to
meet
them
bearing
the
calumet
and
followed
by
warriors
in
shirts
of
embroidered
then
the
whole
village
swarmed
out
like
bees
gathering
around
the
visitors
with
offerings
of
food
and
all
that
was
precious
in
their
eyes
la
salle
was
lodged
with
the
great
chief
but
he
compelled
his
men
to
encamp
at
a
distance
lest
the
ardor
of
their
gallantry
might
give
occasion
of
offence
the
lodges
of
the
cenis
forty
or
fifty
feet
high
and
covered
with
a
thatch
of
looked
like
huge
each
held
several
families
whose
fire
was
in
the
middle
and
their
beds
around
the
circumference
the
spoil
of
the
spaniards
was
to
be
seen
on
all
sides
silver
lamps
and
spoons
swords
old
muskets
money
clothing
and
a
bull
of
the
pope
dispensing
the
spanish
colonists
of
new
mexico
from
fasting
during
summer
these
treasures
as
well
as
their
numerous
horses
were
obtained
by
the
cenis
from
their
neighbors
and
allies
the
camanches
that
fierce
prairie
banditti
who
then
as
now
scourged
the
mexican
border
with
their
bloody
forays
a
party
of
these
wild
horsemen
was
in
the
village
douay
was
edified
at
seeing
them
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
in
imitation
of
the
neophytes
of
one
of
the
spanish
missions
they
enacted
too
the
ceremony
of
the
mass
and
one
of
them
in
his
rude
way
drew
a
sketch
of
a
picture
he
had
seen
in
some
church
which
he
had
pillaged
wherein
the
friar
plainly
recognized
the
virgin
weeping
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
they
invited
the
french
to
join
them
on
a
raid
into
new
mexico
and
they
spoke
with
contempt
as
their
tribesmen
will
speak
to
this
day
of
the
spanish
creoles
saying
that
it
would
be
easy
to
conquer
a
nation
of
cowards
who
make
people
walk
before
them
with
fans
to
cool
them
in
hot
weather
soon
after
leaving
the
cenis
villages
both
la
salle
and
his
nephew
moranget
were
attacked
by
fever
this
caused
a
delay
of
more
than
two
months
during
which
the
party
seem
to
have
remained
encamped
on
the
neches
or
possibly
the
sabine
when
at
length
the
invalids
had
recovered
sufficient
strength
to
travel
the
stock
of
ammunition
was
nearly
spent
some
of
the
men
had
deserted
and
the
condition
of
the
travellers
was
such
that
there
seemed
no
alternative
but
to
return
to

this

accordingly
did

from

the

gave
place
to
a
dejection

on

to
us
an

of

and
a
perpetual
prison
flattering
themselves
with
the
delusion

with

found
the

engraved
on
a
plate
of

with
the

gave
us
a

and
showed
us
some

two
small
pieces
of

cannon
a
small

some
some

and
some

distant
where
they
showed
us
a

also
with
the
arms
of

and
a

this

of

little
river
they
led
with
them
their
five
horses
laden
with
their
scanty
baggage
and
with
what
was
of
no
less
importance
their
stock
of

for

some
wore
the
remains
of
the
clothing
they
had
worn

might
perhaps
have
lived

but
the

is
a
rude
touchstone
which
often
reveals
traits
that
would
have
lain

shawanoe
hunter
who
as
well
as
another
indian
had
twice
crossed
the
ocean
with
him
and
still
followed
his
fortunes
with
an
admiring
though
undemonstrative
fidelity
they
passed
the
prairie
and
neared
the
forest
here
they
saw
buffalo
and
the
hunters
approached
and
killed
several
of
them
then
they
traversed
the
woods
found
and
forded
the
shallow
and
rushy
stream
and
pushed
through
the
forest
beyond
till
they
again
reached
the
open
prairie
heavy
clouds
gathered
over
them
and
it
rained
all
night
but
they
sheltered
themselves
under
the
fresh
hides
of
the
buffalo
they
had
killed
sidenote
prairie
travelling
it
is
impossible
as
it
would
be
needless
to
follow
the
detail
of
their
daily
march
it
was
such
an
one
though
with
unwonted
hardship
as
is
familiar
to
the
memory
of
many
a
prairie
traveller
of
our
own
time
they
suffered
greatly
from
the
want
of
shoes
and
found
for
a
while
no
better
substitute
than
a
casing
of
raw
which
they
were
forced
to
keep
always
wet
as
when
dry
it
hardened
about
the
foot
like
iron
at
length
they
bought
dressed
from
the
indians
of
which
they
made
tolerable
moccasins
the
rivers
streams
and
gullies
filled
with
water
were
without
number
and
to
cross
them
they
made
a
boat
of
like
the
bull
boat
still
used
on
the
upper
missouri
this
did
good
service
as
with
the
help
of
their
horses
they
could
carry
it
with
them
two
or
three
men
could
cross
in
it
at
once
and
the
horses
swam
after
them
like
dogs
sometimes
they
traversed
the
sunny
prairie
sometimes
dived
into
the
dark
recesses
of
the
forest
where
the
buffalo
descending
daily
from
their
pastures
in
long
files
to
drink
at
the
river
often
made
a
broad
and
easy
path
for
the
travellers
when
foul
weather
arrested
them
they
built
huts
of
bark
and
long
and
safely
sheltered
lounged
away
the
day
while
their
horses
picketed
near
by
stood
steaming
in
the
rain
at
night
they
usually
set
a
rude
stockade
about
their
camp
and
here
by
the
grassy
border
of
a
brook
or
at
the
edge
of
a
grove
where
a
spring
bubbled
up
through
the
sands
they
lay
asleep
around
the
embers
of
their
fire
while
the
man
on
guard
listened
to
the
deep
breathing
of
the
slumbering
horses
and
the
howling
of
the
wolves
that
saluted
the
rising
moon
as
it
flooded
the
waste
of
prairie
with
pale
mystic
radiance
they
met
indians
almost
daily
sometimes
a
band
of
hunters
mounted
or
on
foot
chasing
buffalo
on
the
plains
sometimes
a
party
of
fishermen
sometimes
a
winter
camp
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
or
under
the
sheltering
border
of
a
forest
they
held
intercourse
with
them
in
the
distance
by
signs
often
they
disarmed
their
distrust
and
attracted
them
into
their
camp
and
often
they
visited
them
in
their
lodges
where
seated
on
they
smoked
with
their
entertainers
passing
the
pipe
from
hand
to
hand
after
the
custom
still
in
use
among
the
prairie
tribes
cavelier
says
that
they
once
saw
a
band
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
mounted
indians
attacking
a
herd
of
buffalo
with
lances
pointed
with
sharpened
bone
the
old
priest
was
delighted
with
the
sport
which
he
pronounces
the
most
diverting
thing
in
the
world
on
another
occasion
when
the
party
were
encamped
near
the
village
of
a
tribe
which
cavelier
calls
sassory
he
saw
them
catch
an
alligator
about
twelve
feet
long
which
they
proceeded
to
torture
as
if
he
were
a
human
enemy
first
putting
out
his
eyes
and
then
leading
him
to
the
neighboring
prairie
where
having
confined
him
by
a
number
of
stakes
they
spent
the
entire
day
in
tormenting
him
holding
a
northerly
course
the
travellers
crossed
the
brazos
and
reached
the
waters
of
the
trinity
the
weather
was
unfavorable
and
on
one
occasion
they
encamped
in
the
rain
during
four
or
five
days
together
it
was
not
an
harmonious
company
la
salle
cold
and
haughty
reserve
had
returned
at
least
for
those
of
his
followers
to
whom
he
was
not
partial
duhaut
and
the
surgeon
liotot
both
of
whom
were
men
of
some
property
had
a
large
pecuniary
stake
in
the
enterprise
and
were
disappointed
and
incensed
at
its
ruinous
result
they
had
a
quarrel
with
young
moranget
whose
hot
and
hasty
temper
was
as
little
fitted
to
conciliate
as
was
the
harsh
reserve
of
his
uncle
already
at
fort
louis
duhaut
had
intrigued
among
the
men
and
the
mild
admonition
of
joutel
had
not
it
seems
sufficed
to
divert
him
from
his
sinister
purposes
liotot
it
is
said
had
secretly
sworn
vengeance
against
la
salle
whom
he
charged
with
having
caused
the
death
of
his
brother
or
as
some
will
have
it
his
nephew
on
one
of
the
former
journeys
this
young
man
strength
had
failed
and
la
salle
having
ordered
him
to
return
to
the
fort
he
had
been
killed
by
indians
on
the
way
sidenote
murder
of
moranget
the
party
moved
again
as
the
weather
improved
and
on
the
fifteenth
of
march
encamped
within
a
few
miles
of
a
spot
which
la
salle
had
passed
on
his
preceding
journey
and
where
he
had
left
a
quantity
of
indian
corn
and
beans
in
that
is
to
say
hidden
in
the
ground
or
in
a
hollow
tree
as
provisions
were
falling
short
he
sent
a
party
from
the
camp
to
find
it
these
men
were
duhaut
liotot
hiens
the
buccaneer
teissier
nika
the
hunter
and
la
servant
saget
they
opened
the
and
found
the
contents
spoiled
but
as
they
returned
from
their
bootless
errand
they
saw
buffalo
and
nika
shot
two
of
them
they
now
encamped
on
the
spot
and
sent
the
servant
to
inform
la
salle
in
order
that
he
might
send
horses
to
bring
in
the
meat
accordingly
on
the
next
day
he
directed
moranget
and
de
marle
with
the
necessary
horses
to
go
with
saget
to
the
hunters
camp
when
they
arrived
they
found
that
duhaut
and
his
companions
had
already
cut
up
the
meat
and
laid
it
upon
scaffolds
for
smoking
though
it
was
not
yet
so
dry
as
it
seems
this
process
required
duhaut
and
the
others
had
also
put
by
for
themselves
the
and
certain
portions
of
the
meat
to
which
by
woodland
custom
they
had
a
perfect
right
moranget
whose
rashness
and
violence
had
once
before
caused
a
fatal
catastrophe
fell
into
a
most
unreasonable
fit
of
rage
berated
and
menaced
duhaut
and
his
party
and
ended
by
seizing
upon
the
whole
of
the
meat
including
the
reserved
portions
this
added
fuel
to
the
fire
of
duhaut
old
grudge
against
moranget
and
his
uncle
there
is
reason
to
think
that
he
had
harbored
deadly
designs
the
execution
of
which
was
only
hastened
by
the
present
outbreak
the
surgeon
also
bore
hatred
against
moranget
whom
he
had
nursed
with
constant
attention
when
wounded
by
an
indian
arrow
and
who
had
since
repaid
him
with
abuse
these
two
now
took
counsel
apart
with
hiens
teissier
and
and
it
was
resolved
to
kill
moranget
that
night
nika
la
devoted
follower
and
saget
his
faithful
servant
must
die
with
him
all
of
the
five
were
of
one
mind
except
the
pilot
teissier
who
neither
aided
nor
opposed
the
plot
night
came
the
woods
grew
dark
the
evening
meal
was
finished
and
the
evening
pipes
were
smoked
the
order
of
the
guard
was
arranged
and
doubtless
by
design
the
first
hour
of
the
night
was
assigned
to
moranget
the
second
to
saget
and
the
third
to
nika
gun
in
hand
each
stood
watch
in
turn
over
the
silent
but
not
sleeping
forms
around
him
till
his
time
expiring
he
called
the
man
who
was
to
relieve
him
wrapped
himself
in
his
blanket
and
was
soon
buried
in
a
slumber
that
was
to
be
his
last
now
the
assassins
rose
duhaut
and
hiens
stood
with
their
guns
cocked
ready
to
shoot
down
any
one
of
the
destined
victims
who
should
resist
or
fly
the
surgeon
with
an
axe
stole
towards
the
three
sleepers
and
struck
a
rapid
blow
at
each
in
turn
saget
and
nika
died
with
little
movement
but
moranget
started
spasmodically
into
a
sitting
posture
gasping
and
unable
to
speak
and
the
murderers
compelled
de
marle
who
was
not
in
their
plot
to
compromise
himself
by
despatching
him
the
floodgates
of
murder
were
open
and
the
torrent
must
have
its
way
vengeance
and
safety
alike
demanded
the
death
of
la
salle
hiens
or
english
jem
alone
seems
to
have
hesitated
for
he
was
one
of
those
to
whom
that
stern
commander
had
always
been
partial
meanwhile
the
intended
victim
was
still
at
his
camp
about
six
miles
distant
it
is
easy
to
picture
with
sufficient
accuracy
the
features
of
the
scene
the
sheds
of
bark
and
branches
beneath
which
among
blankets
and
rude
harness
guns
and
the
men
lounged

blackened

hung
from

about

of
march
moranget
and
his
companions
had
been
expected
to
return
the
night
before
but
the
whole
day
passed
and
they
did
not
appear
la
salle
became
very
anxious
he
resolved
to
go
and
look
for
them
but
not
well
knowing
the
way
he
told
the
indians
who
were
about
the
camp
that
he
would
give
them
a
hatchet
if
they
would
guide
him
one
of
them
accepted
the
offer
and
la
salle
prepared
to
set
out
in
the
morning
at
the
same
time
directing
joutel
to
be
ready
to
go
with
him
joutel
says
that
evening
while
we
were
talking
about
what
could
have
happened
to
the
absent
men
he
seemed
to
have
a
presentiment
of
what
was
to
take
place
he
asked
me
if
i
had
heard
of
any
machinations
against
them
or
if
i
had
noticed
any
bad
design
on
the
part
of
duhaut
and
the
rest
i
answered
that
i
had
heard
nothing
except
that
they
sometimes
complained
of
being
found
fault
with
so
often
and
that
this
was
all
i
knew
besides
which
as
they
were
persuaded
that
i
was
in
his
interest
they
would
not
have
told
me
of
any
bad
design
they
might
have
we
were
very
uneasy
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
sidenote
the
fatal
shot
in
the
morning
la
salle
set
out
with
his
indian
guide
he
had
changed
his
mind
with
regard
to
joutel
whom
he
now
directed
to
remain
in
charge
of
the
camp
and
to
keep
a
careful
watch
he
told
the
friar
anastase
douay
to
come
with
him
instead
of
joutel
whose
gun
which
was
the
best
in
the
party
he
borrowed
for
the
occasion
as
well
as
his
pistol
the
three
proceeded
on
their
way
la
salle
the
friar
and
the
indian
all
the
way
writes
the
friar
he
spoke
to
me
of
nothing
but
matters
of
piety
grace
and
predestination
enlarging
on
the
debt
he
owed
to
god
who
had
saved
him
from
so
many
perils
during
more
than
twenty
years
of
travel
in
america
suddenly
i
saw
him
overwhelmed
with
a
profound
sadness
for
which
he
himself
could
not
account
he
was
so
much
moved
that
i
scarcely
knew
him
he
soon
recovered
his
usual
calmness
and
they
walked
on
till
they
approached
the
camp
of
duhaut
which
was
on
the
farther
side
of
a
small
river
looking
about
him
with
the
eye
of
a
woodsman
la
salle
saw
two
eagles
circling
in
the
air
nearly
over
him
as
if
attracted
by
carcasses
of
beasts
or
men
he
fired
his
gun
and
his
pistol
as
a
summons
to
any
of
his
followers
who
might
be
within
hearing
the
shots
reached
the
ears
of
the
conspirators
rightly
conjecturing
by
whom
they
were
fired
several
of
them
led
by
duhaut
crossed
the
river
at
a
little
distance
above
where
trees
or
other
intervening
objects
hid
them
from
sight
duhaut
and
the
surgeon
crouched
like
indians
in
the
long
dry
grass
of
the
last
growth
while
stood
in
sight
near
the
bank
la
salle
continuing
to
advance
soon
saw
him
and
calling
to
him
demanded
where
was
moranget
the
man
without
lifting
his
hat
or
any
show
of
respect
replied
in
an
agitated
and
broken
voice
but
with
a
tone
of
studied
insolence
that
moranget
was
strolling
about
somewhere
la
salle
rebuked
and
menaced
him
he
rejoined
with
increased
insolence
drawing
back
as
he
spoke
towards
the
ambuscade
while
the
incensed
commander
advanced
to
chastise
him
at
that
moment
a
shot
was
fired
from
the
grass
instantly
followed
by
another
and
pierced
through
the
brain
la
salle
dropped
dead
the
friar
at
his
side
stood
unable
to
advance
or
to
fly
when
duhaut
rising
from
the
ambuscade
called
out
to
him
to
take
courage
for
he
had
nothing
to
fear
the
murderers
now
came
forward
and
with
wild
looks
gathered
about
their
victim
there
thou
liest
great
bashaw
there
thou
liest
exclaimed
the
surgeon
liotot
in
base
exultation
over
the
unconscious
corpse
with
mockery
and
insult
they
stripped
it
naked
dragged
it
into
the
bushes
and
left
it
there
a
prey
to
the
buzzards
and
the
wolves
thus
in
the
vigor
of
his
manhood
at
the
age
of
died
robert
cavelier
de
la
salle
one
of
the
greatest
men
writes
tonty
of
this
age
without
question
one
of
the
most
remarkable
explorers
whose
names
live
in
history
his
faithful
officer
joutel
thus
sketches
his
portrait
his
firmness
his
courage
his
great
knowledge
of
the
arts
and
sciences
which
made
him
equal
to
every
undertaking
and
his
untiring
energy
which
enabled
him
to
surmount
every
obstacle
would
have
won
at
last
a
glorious
success
for
his
grand
enterprise
had
not
all
his
fine
qualities
been
counterbalanced
by
a
haughtiness
of
manner
which
often
made
him
insupportable
and
by
a
harshness
towards
those
under
his
command
which
drew
upon
him
an
implacable
hatred
and
was
at
last
the
cause
of
his
death
sidenote
his
character
the
enthusiasm
of
the
disinterested
and
chivalrous
champlain
was
not
the
enthusiasm
of
la
salle
nor
had
he
any
part
in
the
zeal
of
the
early
jesuit
explorers
he
belonged
not
to
the
age
of
the
and
the
saint
but
to
the
modern
world
of
practical
study
and
practical
action
he
was
the
hero
not
of
a
principle
nor
of
a
faith
but
simply
of
a
fixed
idea
and
a
determined
purpose
as
often
happens
with
concentred
and
energetic
natures
his
purpose
was
to
him
a
passion
and
an
inspiration
and
he
clung
to
it
with
a
certain
fanaticism
of
devotion
it
was
the
offspring
of
an
ambition
vast
and
comprehensive
yet
acting
in
the
interest
both
of
france
and
of
civilization
serious
in
all
things
incapable
of
the
lighter
pleasures
incapable
of
repose
finding
no
joy
but
in
the
pursuit
of
great
designs
too
shy
for
society
and
too
reserved
for
popularity
often
unsympathetic
and
always
seeming
so
smothering
emotions
which
he
could
not
utter
schooled
to
universal
distrust
stern
to
his
followers
and
pitiless
to
himself
bearing
the
brunt
of
every
hardship
and
every
danger
demanding
of
others
an
equal
constancy
joined
to
an
implicit
deference
heeding
no
counsel
but
his
own
attempting
the
impossible
and
grasping
at
what
was
too
vast
to
hold
he
contained
in
his
own
complex
and
painful
nature
the
chief
springs
of
his
triumphs
his
failures
and
his
death
it
is
easy
to
reckon
up
his
defects
but
it
is
not
easy
to
hide
from
sight
the
roman
virtues
that
redeemed
them
beset
by
a
throng
of
enemies
he
stands
like
the
king
of
israel
head
and
shoulders
above
them
all
he
was
a
tower
of
adamant
against
whose
impregnable
front
hardship
and
danger
the
rage
of
man
and
of
the
elements
the
southern
sun
the
northern
blast
fatigue
famine
disease
delay
disappointment
and
deferred
hope
emptied
their
quivers
in
vain
that
very
pride
which
declared
itself
most
sternly
in
the
thickest
press
of
foes
has
in
it
something
to
challenge
admiration
never
under
the
impenetrable
mail
of
paladin
or
crusader
beat
a
heart
of
more
intrepid
mettle
than
within
the
stoic
panoply
that
armed
the
breast
of
la
salle
to
estimate
aright
the
marvels
of
his
patient
fortitude
one
must
follow
on
his
track
through
the
vast
scene
of
his
interminable
journeyings
those
thousands
of
weary
miles
of
forest
marsh
and
river
where
again
and
again
in
the
bitterness
of
baffled
striving
the
untiring
pilgrim
pushed
onward
towards
the
goal
which
he
was
never
to
attain
america
owes
him
an
enduring
memory
for
in
this
masculine
figure

sees
the
pioneer
who
guided
her
to
the
possession
of
her
richest

sidenote
documentary

tonty
also
speaks
of
him
as
un
flibustier
anglois
in
another
document
he
is
called
james
of
the
three
narratives
of
this
journey
those
of
joutel
cavelier
and
anastase
douay
the
first
is
by
far
the
best
that
of
cavelier
seems
the
work
of
a
man
of
confused
brain
and
indifferent
memory
some
of
his
statements
are
irreconcilable
with
those
of
joutel
and
douay
and
known
facts
of
his
history
justify
the
suspicion
of
a
wilful
inaccuracy
joutel

is
of
a
very
different
character
and
seems
to
be
the
work
of
an
honest
and
intelligent
man
account

brief
but
it
agrees
with
that
of

essential
points
cavelier
called

by

on
the
assassination
of

the
evidence
is
fourfold
the
narrative
of
douay
who
was
with
him
at
the
time
that
of
joutel
who
learned
the
facts
immediately
after
they
took
place
from
douay
and
others
and
who
parted
from
la

an
hour
or
more
before

of
which
a
copy
from

is
before

and
which
has
recently
been
printed
by

the
narrative
of

unfortunately
fails
us
several
weeks
before
the
death
of
his
brother
the
remainder
being
lost
on
a
study
of
these
various
documents
it
is
impossible
to
resist
the
conclusion
that
neither
cavelier
nor
douay
always
wrote
honestly
joutel
on
the
contrary
gives
the
impression
of
sense
intelligence
and
candor
throughout
charlevoix
who
knew
him
long
after
says
that
he
was
un
fort
honnête
homme
et
le
seul
de
la
troupe
de
de
la
salle
sur
qui
ce
célèbre
voyageur
pût

tonty
derived
his
information
from
the
survivors
of
la

party
couture
whose
statements
are
embodied
in
the
de
la

de
de

was
one
of
tonty
men
who
as
will
be
seen
hereafter
were
left
by
him
at
the
mouth
of
the
arkansas
and
to
whom
cavelier
told
the
story
of
his
brother
death
couture
also
repeats
the
statements
of
one
of
la
salle
followers
undoubtedly
a
parisian
boy
named
barthelemy
who
was
violently
prejudiced
against
his
chief
whom
he
slanders
to
the
utmost
of
his
skill
saying
that
he
was
so
enraged
at
his
failures
that
he
did
not
approach
the
sacraments
for
two
years
that
he
nearly
starved
his
brother
cavelier
allowing
him
only
a
handful
of
meal
a
day
that
he
killed
with
his
own
hand
quantité
de
personnes
who
did
not
work
to
his
liking
and
that
he
killed
the
sick
in
their
beds
without
mercy
under
the
pretence
that
they
were
counterfeiting
sickness
in
order
to
escape
work
these
assertions
certainly
have
no
other
foundation
than
the
undeniable
rigor
of
la
salle
command
douay
says
that
he
confessed
and
made
his
devotions
on
the
morning
of
his
death
while
cavelier
always
speaks
of
him
as
the
hope
and
the
staff
of
the
colony
douay
declares
that
la
salle
lived
an
hour
after
the
fatal
shot
that
he
gave
him
absolution
buried
his
body
and
planted
a
cross
on
his
grave
at
the
time
he
told
joutel
a
different
story
and
the
latter
with
the
best
means
of
learning
the
facts
explicitly
denies
the
friar
printed
statement
couture
on
the
authority
of
cavelier
himself
also
says
that
neither
he
nor
douay
was
permitted
to
take
any
step
for
burying
the
body
tonty
says
that
cavelier
begged
leave
to
do
so
but
was
refused
douay
unwilling
to
place
upon
record
facts
from
which
the
inference
might
easily
be
drawn
that
he
had
been
terrified
from
discharging
his
duty
no
doubt
invented
the
story
of
the
burial
as
well
as
that
of
the
edifying
behavior
of
moranget
after
he
had
been
struck
in
the
head
with
an
axe
the
locality
of
la
salle
assassination
is
sufficiently
clear
from
a
comparison
of
the
several
narratives
and
it
is
also
indicated
on
a
contemporary
manuscript
map
made
on
the
return
of
the
survivors
of
the
party
to
france
the
scene
of
the
catastrophe
is
here
placed

to

this
can
not
be
meant
to

all

which
raise
the

much
higher

joutel
for
the
moment
was
absent
and
who
had
a
kindness
for
him
went
quietly
to
seek
him
he
found
him
on
a
hillock
making
a
fire
of
dried
grass
in
order
that
the
smoke
might
guide
la
salle
on
his
return
and
watching
the
horses
grazing
in
the
meadow
below
i
was
very
much
surprised
writes
joutel
when
i
saw
him
approaching
when
he
came
up
to
me
he
seemed
all
in
confusion
or
rather
out
of
his
wits
he
began
with
saying
that
there
was
very
bad
news
i
asked
what
it
was
he
answered
that
the
sieur
de
la
salle
was
dead
and
also
his
nephew
the
sieur
de
moranget
his
indian
hunter
and
his
servant
i
was
petrified
and
did
not
know
what
to
say
for
i
saw
that
they
had
been
murdered
the
man
added
that
at
first
the
murderers
had
sworn
to
kill
me
too
i
easily
believed
it
for
i
had
always
been
in
the
interest
of
de
la
salle
and
had
commanded
in
his
place
and
it
is
hard
to
please
everybody
or
prevent
some
from
being
dissatisfied
i
was
greatly
perplexed
as
to
what
i
ought
to
do
and
whether
i
had
not
better
escape
to
the
woods
whithersoever
god
should
guide
me
but
by
bad
or
good
luck
i
had
no
gun
and
only
one
pistol
without
balls
or
powder
except
what
was
in
my
to
whatever
side
i
turned
my
life
was
in
great
peril
it
is
true
that
assured
me
that
they
had
changed
their
minds
and
had
agreed
to
murder
nobody
else
unless
they
met
with
resistance
so
being
in
no
condition
as
i
just
said
to
go
far
having
neither
arms
nor
powder
i
abandoned
myself
to
providence
and
went
back
to
the
camp
where
i
found
that
these
wretched
murderers
had
seized
everything
belonging
to
de
la
salle
and
even
my
personal
effects
they
had
also
taken
possession
of
all
the
arms
the
first
words
that
duhaut
said
to
me
were
that
each
should
command
in
turn
to
which
i
made
no
answer
i
saw
cavelier
praying
in
a
corner
and
father
anastase
in
another
he
did
not
dare
to
speak
to
me
nor
did
i
dare
to
go
towards
him
till
i
had
seen
the
designs
of
the
assassins
they
were
in
furious
excitement
but
nevertheless
very
uneasy
and
embarrassed
i
was
some
time
without
speaking
and
as
it
were
without
moving
for
fear
of
giving
umbrage
to
our
enemies
they
had
cooked
some
meat
and
when
it
was
they
distributed
it
as
they
saw
fit
saying
that
formerly
their
share
had
been
served
out
to
them
but
that
it
was
they
who
would
serve
it
out
in
future
they
no
doubt
wanted
me
to
say
something
that
would
give
them
a
chance
to
make
a
noise
but
i
managed
always
to
keep
my
mouth
closed
when
night
came
and
it
was
time
to
stand
guard
they
were
in
perplexity
as
they
could
not
do
it
alone
therefore
they
said
to
cavelier
father
anastase
me
and
the
others
who
were
not
in
the
plot
with
them
that
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
stand
guard
as
usual
that
there
was
no
use
in
thinking
about
what
had
happened
that
what
was
done
was
done
that
they
had
been
driven
to
it
by
despair
and
that
they
were
sorry
for
it
and
meant
no
more
harm
to
anybody
cavelier
took
up
the
word
and
told
them
that
when
they
killed
de
la
salle
they
killed
themselves
for
there
was
nobody
but
him
who
could
get
us
out
of
this
country
at
last
after
a
good
deal
of
talk
on
both
sides
they
gave
us
our
arms
so
we
stood
guard
during
which
cavelier
told
me
how
they
had
come
to
the
camp
entered
his
hut
like
so
many
madmen
and
seized
everything
in
it
joutel
douay
and
the
two
caveliers
spent
a
sleepless
night
consulting
as
to
what
they
should
do
they
mutually
pledged
themselves
to
stand
by
each
other
to
the
last
and
to
escape
as
soon
as
they
could
from
the
company
of
the
assassins
in
the
morning
duhaut
and
his
accomplices
after
much
discussion
resolved
to
go
to
the
cenis
villages
and
accordingly
the
whole
party
broke
up
their
camp
packed
their
horses
and
began
their
march
they
went
five
leagues
and
encamped
at
the
edge
of
a
grove
on
the
following
day
they
advanced
again
till
noon
when
heavy
rains
began
and
they
were
forced
to
stop
by
the
banks
of
a
river
we
passed
the
night
and
the
next
day
there
says
joutel
and
during
that
time
my
mind
was
possessed
with
dark
thoughts
it
was
hard
to
prevent
ourselves
from
being
in
constant
fear
among
such
men
and
we
could
not
look
at
them
without
horror
when
i
thought
of
the
cruel
deeds
they
had
committed
and
the
danger
we
were
in
from
them
i
longed
to
revenge
the
evil
they
had
done
us
this
would
have
been
easy
while
they
were
asleep
but
cavelier
dissuaded
us
saying
that
we
ought
to
leave
vengeance
to
god
and
that
he
himself
had
more
to
revenge
than
we
having
lost
his
brother
and
his
nephew
sidenote
journey
to
the
cenis
the
comic
alternated
with
the
tragic
on
the
they
reached
the
bank
of
a
river
too
deep
to
ford
those
who
knew
how
to
swim
crossed
without
difficulty
but
joutel
cavelier
and
douay
were
not
of
the
number
accordingly
they
launched
a
log
of
light
dry
wood
embraced
it
with
one
arm
and
struck
out
for
the
other
bank
with
their
legs
and
the
arm
that
was
left
free
but
the
friar
became
frightened
he
only
clung
fast
to
the
aforesaid
log
says
joutel
and
did
nothing
to
help
us
forward
while
i
was
trying
to
swim
my
body
being
stretched
at
full
length
i
hit
him
in
the
belly
with
my
feet
on
which
he
thought
it
was
all
over
with
him
and
i
can
answer
for
it
he
invoked
saint
francis
with
might
and
main
i
could
not
help
laughing
though
i
was
myself
in
danger
of
drowning
some
indians
who
had
joined
the
party
swam
to
the
rescue
and
pushed
the
log
across
the
path
to
the
cenis
villages
was
exceedingly
faint
and
but
for
the
indians
they
would
have
lost
the
way
they
crossed
the
main
stream
of
the
trinity
in
a
boat
of
raw
hides
and
then
being
short
of
provisions
held
a
council
to
determine
what
they
should
do
it
was
resolved
that
joutel
with
hiens
liotot
and
teissier
should
go
in
advance
to
the
villages
and
buy
a
supply
of
corn
thus
joutel
found
himself
doomed
to
the
company
of
three
villains
who
he
strongly
suspected
were
contriving
an
opportunity
to
kill
him
but
as
he
had
no
choice
he
dissembled
his
doubts
and
set
out
with
his
sinister
companions
duhaut
having
first
supplied
him
with
goods
for
the
intended
barter
sidenote
joutel
and
the
cenis
they
rode
over
hills
and
plains
till
night
encamped
supped
on
a
wild
turkey
and
continued
their
journey
till
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
when
they
saw
three
men
approaching
on
horseback
one
of
whom
to
joutel
alarm
was
dressed
like
a
spaniard
he
proved
however
to
be
a
cenis
indian
like
the
others
the
three
turned
their
horses
heads
and
accompanied
the
frenchmen
on
their
way
at
length
they
neared
the
indian
town
which
with
its
large
thatched
lodges
looked
like
a
cluster
of
gigantic
haystacks
their
approach
had
been
made
known
and
they
were
received
in
solemn
state
twelve
of
the
elders
came
to
meet
them
in
their
dress
of
ceremony
each
with
his
face
daubed
red
or
black
and
his
head
adorned
with
painted
plumes
from
their
shoulders
hung
wrought
with
gay
colors
some
carried
some
bows
and
arrows
some
the
blades
of
spanish
rapiers
attached
to
wooden
handles
decorated
with
hawk
bells
and
bunches
of
feathers
they
stopped
before
the
honored
guests
and
raising
their
hands
aloft
uttered
howls
so
extraordinary
that
joutel
could
hardly
preserve
the
gravity
which
the
occasion
demanded
having
next
embraced
the
frenchmen
the
elders
conducted
them
into
the
village
attended
by
a
crowd
of
warriors
and
young
men
ushered
them
into
their
a
large
lodge
devoted
to
councils
feasts
dances
and
other
public
assemblies
seated
them
on
mats
and
squatted
in
a
ring
around
them
here
they
were
regaled
with
sagamite
or
indian
porridge
beans
bread
made
of
the
meal
of
parched
corn
and
another
kind
of
bread
made
of
the
kernels
of
nuts
and
the
seed
of
sunflowers
then
the
pipe
was
lighted
and
all
smoked
together
the
four
frenchmen
proposed
to
open
a
traffic
for
provisions
and
their
entertainers
grunted
assent
joutel
found
a
frenchman
in
the
village
he
was
a
young
man
from
provence
who
had
deserted
from
la
salle
on
his
last
journey
and
was
now
to
all
appearance
a
savage
like
his
adopted
countrymen
being
naked
like
them
and
affecting
to
have
forgotten
his
native
language
he
was
very
friendly
however
and
invited
the
visitors
to
a
neighboring
village
where
he
lived
and
where
as
he
told
them
they
would
find
a
better
supply
of
corn
they
accordingly
set
out
with
him
escorted
by
a
crowd
of
indians
they
saw
lodges
and
clusters
of
lodges
scattered
along
their
path
at
intervals
each
with
its
field
of
corn
beans
and
pumpkins
rudely
cultivated
with
a
wooden
hoe
reaching
their
destination
which
was
four
or
five
leagues
distant
they
were
greeted
with
the
same
honors
as
at
the
first
village
and
the
ceremonial
of
welcome
over
were
lodged
in
the
abode
of
the
savage
frenchman
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
however
that
he
and
his
squaws
of
whom
he
had
a
considerable
number
dwelt
here
alone
for
these
lodges
of
the
cenis
often
contained
eight
or
ten
families
they
were
made
by
firmly
planting
in
a
circle
tall
straight
young
trees
such
as
grew
in
the
swamps
the
tops
were
then
bent
inward
and
lashed
together
great
numbers
of
were
bound
on
and
the
frame
thus
constructed
was
thickly
covered
with
thatch
a
hole
being
left
at
the
top
for
the
escape
of
the
smoke
the
inmates
were
ranged
around
the
circumference
of
the
structure
each
family
in
a
kind
of
stall
open
in
front
but
separated
from
those
adjoining
it
by
partitions
of
mats
here
they
placed
their
beds
of
cane
their
painted
robes
of
buffalo
and
their
cooking
utensils
of
pottery
and
other
household
goods
and
here
too
the
head
of
the
family
hung
his
bow
quiver
lance
and
shield
there
was
nothing
in
common
but
the
fire
which
burned
in
the
middle
of
the
lodge
and
was
never
suffered
to
go
out
these
dwellings
were
of
great
size
and
joutel
declares
that
he
has
seen
some
of
them
sixty
feet
in
diameter
it
was
in
one
of
the
largest
that
the
four
travellers
were
now
lodged
a
place
was
assigned
them
where
to
bestow
their
baggage
and
they
took
possession
of
their
quarters
amid
the
silent
stares
of
the
whole
community
they
asked
their
renegade
countryman
the
provençal
if
they
were
safe
he
replied
that
they
were
but
this
did
not
wholly
reassure
them
and
they
spent
a
somewhat
wakeful
night
in
the
morning
they
opened
their
budgets
and
began
a
brisk
trade
in
knives
awls
beads
and
other
trinkets
which
they
exchanged
for
corn
and
beans
before
evening
they
had
acquired
a
considerable
stock
and
joutel
three
companions
declared
their
intention
of
returning
with
it
to
the
camp
leaving
him
to
continue
the
trade
they
went
accordingly
in
the
morning
and
joutel
was
left
alone
on
the
one
hand
he
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
them
on
the
other
he
found
his
position
among
the
cenis
very
irksome
and
as
he
thought
insecure
besides
the
provençal
who
had
gone
with
liotot
and
his
companions
there
were
two
other
french
deserters
among
this
tribe
and
joutel
was
very
desirous
to
see
them
hoping
that
they
could
tell
him
the
way
to
the
mississippi
for
he
was
resolved
to
escape
at
the
first
opportunity
from
the
company
of
duhaut
and
his
accomplices
he
therefore
made
the
present
of
a
knife
to
a
young
indian
whom
he
sent
to
find
the
two
frenchmen
and
invite
them
to
come
to
the
village
meanwhile
he
continued
his
barter
but
under
many
difficulties
for
he
could
only
explain
himself
by
signs
and
his
customers
though
friendly
by
day
pilfered
his
goods
by
night
this
joined
to
the
fears
and
troubles
which
burdened
his
mind
almost
deprived
him
of
sleep
and
as
he
confesses
greatly
depressed
his
spirits
indeed
he
had
little
cause
for
cheerfulness
as
to
the
past
present
or
future
an
old
indian
one
of
the
patriarchs
of
the
tribe
observing
his
dejection
and
anxious
to
relieve
it
one
evening
brought
him
a
young
wife
saying
that
he
made
him
a
present
of
her
she
seated
herself
at
his
side
but
says
joutel
as
my
head
was
full
of
other
cares
and
anxieties
i
said
nothing
to
the
poor
girl
she
waited
for
a
little
time
and
then
finding
that
i
did
not
speak
a
word
she
went
away
sidenote
white
savages
late
one
night
he
lay
between
sleeping
and
waking
on
the
that
covered
his
bed
of
canes
all
around
the
great
lodge
its
inmates
were
buried
in
sleep
and
the
fire
that
still
burned
in
the
midst
cast
ghostly
gleams
on
the
trophies
of
savage
chivalry
the
treasured
the
spear
and
and
shield
of
whitened
that
hung
by
each
warrior
such
was
the
weird
scene
that
lingered
on
the
dreamy
eyes
of
joutel
as
he
closed
them
at
last
in
a
troubled
sleep
the
sound
of
a
footstep
soon
wakened
him
and
turning
he
saw
at
his
side
the
figure
of
a
naked
savage
armed
with
a
bow
and
arrows
joutel
spoke
but
received
no
answer
not
knowing
what
to
think
he
reached
out
his
hand
for
his
pistols
on
which
the
intruder
withdrew
and
seated
himself
by
the
fire
thither
joutel
followed
and
as
the
light
fell
on
his
features
he
looked
at
him
closely
his
face
was
tattooed
after
the
cenis
fashion
in
lines
drawn
from
the
top
of
the
forehead
and
converging
to
the
chin
and
his
body
was
decorated
with
similar
embellishments
suddenly
this
supposed
indian
rose
and
threw
his
arms
around
joutel
neck
making
himself
known
at
the
same
time
as
one
of
the
frenchmen
who
had
deserted
from
la
salle
and
taken
refuge
among
the
cenis
he
was
a
breton
sailor
named
ruter
his
companion
named
grollet
also
a
sailor
had
been
afraid
to
come
to
the
village
lest
he
should
meet
la
salle
ruter
expressed
surprise
and
regret
when
he
heard
of
the
death
of
his
late
commander
he
had
deserted
him
but
a
few
months
before
that
brief
interval
had
sufficed
to
transform
him
into
a
savage
and
both
he
and
his
companion
found
their
present
reckless
and
ungoverned
way
of
life
greatly
to
their
liking
he
could
tell
nothing
of
the
mississippi
and
on
the
next
day
he
went
home
carrying
with
him
a
present
of
beads
for
his
wives
of
which
last
he
had
made
a
large
collection
in
a
few
days
he
reappeared
bringing
grollet
with
him
each
wore
a
bunch
of
dangling
from
his
head
and
each
had
wrapped
his
naked
body
in
a
blanket
three
men
soon
after
arrived
from
camp
commissioned
to
receive
the
corn
which
joutel
had
purchased
they
told
him
that
duhaut
and
liotot
the
tyrants
of
the
party
had
resolved
to
return
to
fort
louis
and
build
a
vessel
to
escape
to
the
west
indies
a
visionary
scheme
writes
joutel
for
our
carpenters
were
all
dead
and
even
if
they
had
been
alive
they
were
so
ignorant
that
they
would
not
have
known
how
to
go
about
the
work
besides
we
had
no
tools
for
it
nevertheless
i
was
obliged
to
obey
and
set
out
for
the
camp
with
the
provisions
on
arriving
he
found
a
wretched
state
of
affairs
douay
and
the
two
caveliers
who
had
been
treated
by
duhaut
with
great
harshness
and
contempt
had
been
told
to
make
their
mess
apart
and
joutel
now
joined
them
this
separation
restored
them
their
freedom
of
speech
of
which
they
had
hitherto
been
deprived
but
it
subjected
them
to
incessant
hunger
as
they
were
allowed
only
food
enough
to
keep
them
from
famishing
douay
says
that
quarrels
were
rife
among
the
assassins
themselves
the
malcontents
being
headed
by
hiens
who
was
enraged
that
duhaut
and
liotot
should
have
engrossed
all
the
plunder
joutel
was
helpless
for
he
had
none
to
back
him
but
two
priests
and
a
boy
sidenote
schemes
of
escape
he
and
his
companions
talked
of
nothing
around
their
solitary
but
the
means
of
escaping
from
the
villanous
company
into
which
they
were
thrown
they
saw
no
resource
but
to
find
the
mississippi
and
thus
make
their
way
to
canada
a
prodigious
undertaking
in
their
forlorn
condition
nor
was
there
any
probability
that
the
assassins
would
permit
them
to
go
these
on
their
part
were
beset
with
difficulties
they
could
not
return
to
civilization
without
manifest
peril
of
a
halter
and
their
only
safety
was
to
turn
buccaneers
or
savages
duhaut
however
still
held
to
his
plan
of
going
back
to
fort
louis
and
joutel
and
his
companions
who
with
good
reason
stood
in
daily
fear
of
him
devised
among
themselves
a
simple
artifice
to
escape
from
his
company
the
elder
cavelier
was
to
tell
him
that
they
were
too
fatigued
for
the
journey
and
wished
to
stay
among
the
cenis
and
to
beg
him
to
allow
them
a
portion
of
the
goods
for
which
cavelier
was
to
give
his
note
of
hand
the
old
priest
whom
a
sacrifice
of
truth
even
on
less
important
occasions
cost
no
great
effort
accordingly
opened
the
negotiation
and
to
his
own
astonishment
and
that
of
his
companions
gained
the
assent
of
duhaut
their
joy
however
was
short
for
ruter
the
french
savage
to
whom
joutel
had
betrayed
his
intention
when
inquiring
the
way
to
the
mississippi
told
it
to
duhaut
who
on
this
changed
front
and
made
the
ominous
declaration
that
he
and
his
men
would
also
go
to
canada
joutel
and
his
companions
were
now
filled
with
alarm
for
there
was
no
likelihood
that
the
assassins
would
permit
them
the
witnesses
of
their
crime
to
reach
the
settlements
alive
in
the
midst
of
their
trouble
the
sky
was
cleared
as
by
the
crash
of
a
thunderbolt
sidenote
the
crisis
hiens
and
several
others
had
gone
some
time
before
to
the
cenis
villages
to
purchase
horses
and
here
they
had
been
detained
by
the
charms
of
the
indian
women
during
their
stay
hiens
heard
of
new
plan
of
going
to
canada
by
the
mississippi
and
he
declared
to
those
with
him
that
he
would
not
consent
on
a
morning
early
in
may
he
appeared
at
duhaut
camp
with
ruter
and
grollet
the
french
savages
and
about
twenty
indians
duhaut
and
liotot
it
is
said
were
passing
the
time
by
practising
with
bows
and
arrows
in
front
of
their
hut
one
of
them
called
to
hiens
but
the
buccaneer
returned
a
sullen
answer
he
then
accosted
duhaut
telling
him
that
he
had
no
mind
to
go
up
the
mississippi
with
him
and
demanding
a
share
of
the
goods
duhaut
replied
that
the
goods
were
his
own
since
la
salle
had
owed
him
money
so
you
will
not
give
them
to
me
returned
hiens
no
was
the
answer
you
are
a
wretch
exclaimed
hiens
you
killed
my
master
and
drawing
a
pistol
from
his
belt
he
fired
at
duhaut
who
staggered
three
or
four
paces
and
fell
dead
almost
at
the
same
instant
ruter
fired
his
gun
at
liotot
shot
three
balls
into
his
body
and
stretched
him
on
the
ground
mortally
wounded
douay
and
the
two
caveliers
stood
in
extreme
terror
thinking
that
their
turn
was
to
come
next
joutel
no
less
alarmed
snatched
his
gun
to
defend
himself
but
hiens
called
to
him
to
fear
nothing
declaring
that
what
he
had
done
was
only
to
avenge
the
death
of
la
salle
to
which
nevertheless
he
had
been
privy
though
not
an
active
sharer
in
the
crime
liotot
lived
long
enough
to
make
his
confession
after
which
ruter
killed
him
by
exploding
a
pistol
loaded
with
a
blank
charge
of
powder
against
his
head
duhaut
myrmidon
was
absent
hunting
and
hiens
was
for
killing
him
on
his
return
but
the
two
priests
and
joutel
succeeded
in
dissuading
him
the
indian
spectators
beheld
these
murders
with
undisguised
amazement
and
almost
with
horror
what
manner
of
men
were
these
who
had
pierced
the
secret
places
of
the
wilderness
to
riot
in
mutual
slaughter
their
fiercest
warriors
might
learn
a
lesson
in
ferocity
from
these
heralds
of
civilization
joutel
and
his
companions
who
could
not
dispense
with
the
aid
of
the
cenis
were
obliged
to
explain
away
as
they
best
might
the
atrocity
of
what
they
had
witnessed
hiens
and
others
of
the
french
had
before
promised
to
join
the
cenis
on
an
expedition
against
a
neighboring
tribe
with
whom
they
were
at
war
and
the
whole
party
having
removed
to
the
indian
village
the
warriors
and
their
allies
prepared
to
depart
six
frenchmen
went
with
hiens
and
the
rest
including
joutel
douay
and
the
caveliers
remained
behind
in
the
lodge
where
joutel
had
been
domesticated
and
where
none
were
now
left
but
women
children
and
old
men
here
they
remained
a
week
or
more
watched
closely
by
the
cenis
who
would
not
let
them
leave
the
village
when
news
at
length
arrived
of
a
great
victory
and
the
warriors
soon
after
returned
with
scalps
it
was
the
french
guns
that
won
the
battle
but
not
the
less
did
they
glory
in
their
prowess
and
several
days
were
spent
in
ceremonies
and
feasts
of
triumph
when
all
this
hubbub
of
rejoicing
had
subsided
joutel
and
his
companions
broke
to
hiens
their
plan
of
attempting
to
reach
home
by
way
of
the
mississippi
as
they
had
expected
he
opposed
it
vehemently
declaring
that
for
his
own
part
he
would
not
run
such
a
risk
of
losing
his
head
but
at
length
he
consented
to
their
departure
on
condition
that
the
elder
cavelier
should
give
him
a
certificate
of
his
entire
innocence
of
the
murder
of
la
salle
which
the
priest
did
not
hesitate
to
do
for
the
rest
hiens
treated
his
departing
with
the
generosity
of
a
successful
for
he
gave
them
a
good
share
of
the
plunder
he
had
won
by
his
late
crime
supplying
them
with
hatchets
knives
beads
and
other
articles
of
trade
besides
several
horses
meanwhile
adds
joutel
we
had
the
mortification
and
chagrin
of
seeing
this
scoundrel
walking
about
the
camp
in
a
scarlet
coat
laced
with
gold
which
had
belonged
to
the
late
monsieur
de
la
salle
and
which
he
had
seized
upon
as
also
upon
all
the
rest
of
his
property
a
shot
would
have
avenged
the
wrong
but
joutel
was
clearly
a
mild
and
moderate
person
and
the
elder
cavelier
had
constantly
opposed
all
plans
of
violence
therefore
they
stifled
their
emotions
and
armed
themselves
with
patience
sidenote
joutel
and
his
party
joutel
party
consisted
besides
himself
of
the
caveliers
uncle
and
nephew
anastase
douay
de
marle
teissier
and
a
young
parisian
named
barthelemy
teissier
an
accomplice
in
the
murders
of
moranget
and
la
salle
had
obtained
a
pardon
in
form
from
the
elder
cavelier
they
had
six
horses
and
three
cenis
guides
hiens
embraced
them
at
parting
as
did
the
ruffians
who
remained
with
him
their
course
was
northeast
toward
the
mouth
of
the
arkansas
a
distant
goal
the
way
to
which
was
beset
with
so
many
dangers
that
their
chance
of
reaching
it
seemed
small
it
was
early
in
june
and
the
forests
and
prairies
were
green
with
the
verdure
of
opening
summer
they
soon
reached
the
assonis
a
tribe
near
the
sabine
who
received
them
well
and
gave
them
guides
to
the
nations
dwelling
towards
red
river
on
the
they
approached
a
village
the
inhabitants
of
which
regarding
them
as
curiosities
of
the
first
order
came
out
in
a
body
to
see
them
and
eager
to
do
them
honor
they
required
them
to
mount
on
their
backs
and
thus
make
their
entrance
in
procession
joutel
being
large
and
heavy
weighed
down
his
bearer
insomuch
that
two
of
his
countrymen
were
forced
to
sustain
him
one
on
each
side
on
arriving
an
old
chief
washed
their
faces
with
warm
water
from
an
earthen
pan
and
then
invited
them
to
mount
on
a
scaffold
of
canes
where
they
sat
in
the
hot
sun
listening
to
four
successive
speeches
of
welcome
of
which
they
understood
not
a
word
at
the
village
of
another
tribe
farther
on
their
way
they
met
with
a
welcome
still
more
oppressive
cavelier
the
unworthy
successor
of
his
brother
being
represented
as
the
chief
of
the
party
became
the
principal
victim
of
their
attentions
they
danced
the
calumet
before
him
while
an
indian
taking
him
with
an
air
of
great
respect
by
the
shoulders
as
he
sat
shook
him
in
cadence
with
the
thumping
of
the
drum
they
then
placed
two
girls
close
beside
him
as
his
wives
while
at
the
same
time
an
old
chief
tied
a
painted
feather
in
his
hair
these
proceedings
so
scandalized
him
that
pretending
to
be
ill
he
broke
off
the
ceremony
but
they
continued
to
sing
all
night
with
so
much
zeal
that
several
of
them
were
reduced
to
a
state
of
complete
exhaustion
sidenote
arrival
at
the
arkansas
at
length
after
a
journey
of
about
two
months
during
which
they
lost
one
of
their
number
de
marle
accidentally
drowned
while
bathing
the
travellers
approached
the
river
arkansas
at
a
point
not
far
above
its
junction
with
the
mississippi
led
by
their
indian
guides
they
traversed
a
rich
district
of
plains
and
woods
and
stood
at
length
on
the
borders
of
the
stream
nestled
beneath
the
forests
of
the
farther
shore
they
saw
the
lodges
of
a
large
indian
town
and
here
as
they
gazed
across
the
broad
current
they
presently
descried
an
object
which
nerved
their
spent
limbs
and
thrilled
their
homesick
hearts
with
joy
it
was
a
tall
wooden
cross
and
near
it
was
a
small
house
built
evidently
by
christian
hands
with
one
accord
they
fell
on
their
knees
and
raised
their
hands
to
heaven
in
thanksgiving
two
men
in
european
dress
issued
from
the
door
of
the
house
and
fired
their
guns
to
salute
the
excited
travellers
who
on
their
part
replied
with
a
volley
canoes
put
out
from
the
farther
shore
and
ferried
them
to
the
town
where
they
were
welcomed
by
couture
and
de
launay
two
followers
of
henri
de
tonty
that
brave
loyal
and
generous
man
always
vigilant
and
always
active
beloved
and
feared
alike
by
white
men
and
by
red
had
been
ejected
as
we
have
seen
by
the
agent
of
the
governor
la
barre
from
the
command
of
fort
louis
of
the
illinois
an
order
from
the
king
had
reinstated
him
and
he
no
sooner
heard
the
news
of
la
landing
on
the
shores
of
the
gulf
and
of
the
disastrous
beginnings
of
his
colony
than
he
prepared
on
his
own
responsibility
and
at
his
own
cost
to
go
to
his
assistance
he
collected
frenchmen
and
eleven
indians
and
set
out
from
his
fortified
rock
on
the
thirteenth
of
february
descended
the
mississippi
and
reached
its
mouth
in
holy
week
all
was
solitude
a
voiceless
desolation
of
river
marsh
and
sea
he
despatched
canoes
to
the
east
and
to
the
west
searching
the
coast
for
some
thirty
leagues
on
either
side
finding
no
trace
of
his
friend
who
at
that
moment
was
ranging
the
prairies
of
texas
in
no
less
fruitless
search
of
his
fatal
river
tonty
wrote
for
him
a
letter
which
he
left
in
the
charge
of
an
indian
chief
who
preserved
it
with
reverential
care
and
gave
it
fourteen
years
after
to
iberville
the
founder
of
louisiana
deeply
disappointed
at
his
failure
tonty
retraced
his
course
and
ascended
the
mississippi
to
the
villages
of
the
arkansas
where
some
of
his
men
volunteered
to
remain
he
left
six
of
them
and
of
this
number
were
couture
and
de
launay
sidenote
a
hospitable
reception
cavelier
and
his
companions
followed
by
a
crowd
of
indians
some
carrying
their
baggage
some
struggling
for
a
view
of
the
white
strangers
entered
the
log
cabin
of
their
two
hosts
rude
as
it
was
they
found
in
it
an
earnest
of
peace
and
safety
and
a
foretaste
of
home
couture
and
de
launay
were
moved
even
to
tears
by
the
story
of
their
disasters
and
of
the
catastrophe
that
crowned
them
la
death
was
carefully
concealed
from
the
indians
many
of
whom
had
seen
him
on
his
descent
of
the
mississippi
and
who
regarded
him
with
prodigious
respect
they
lavished
all
their
hospitality
on
his
followers
feasted
them
on
dried
buffalo
meat
and
watermelons
and
danced
the
calumet
before
them
the
most
august
of
all
their
ceremonies
on
this
occasion
cavelier
patience
failed
him
again
and
pretending
as
before
to
be
ill
he
called
on
his
nephew
to
take
his
place
there
were
solemn
dances
too
in
which
the
warriors
some
bedaubed
with
white
clay
some
with
red
and
some
with
both
some
wearing
feathers
and
some
the
horns
of
buffalo
some
naked
and
some
in
painted
shirts
of
fringed
with
insomuch
says
joutel
that
they
looked
like
a
troop
of
devils
leaped
stamped
and
howled
from
sunset
till
dawn
all
this
was
partly
to
do
the
travellers
honor
and
partly
to
extort
presents
they
made
objections
however
when
asked
to
furnish
guides
and
it
was
only
by
dint
of
great
offers
that
four
were
at
length
procured
sidenote
the
mississippi
with
these
the
travellers
resumed
their
journey
in
a
wooden
canoe
about
the
first
of
august
descended
the
arkansas
and
soon
reached
the
dark
and
inexorable
river
so
long
the
object
of
their
search
rolling
like
a
destiny
through
its
realms
of
solitude
and
shade
they
launched
their
canoe
on
its
turbid
bosom
plied
their
oars
against
the
current
and
slowly
won
their
way
upward
following
the
writhings
of
this
watery
monster
through
swamp
and
fen
it
was
a
hard
and
toilsome
journey
under
the
sweltering
sun
of
august
now
on
the
water
now
in
mud
dragging
their
canoe
through
the
unwholesome
jungle
on
the
nineteenth
they
passed
the
mouth
of
the
ohio
and
their
indian
guides
made
it
an
offering
of
buffalo
meat
on
the
first
of
september
they
passed
the
missouri
and
soon
after
saw
marquette
pictured
rock
and
the
line
of
craggy
heights
on
the
east
shore
marked
on
old
french
maps
as
the
ruined
castles
then
with
a
sense
of
relief
they
turned
from
the
great
river
into
the
peaceful
current
of
the
illinois
they
were
eleven
days
in
ascending
it
in
their
large
and
heavy
wooden
canoe
when
at
length
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fourteenth
of
september
they
saw
towering
above
the
forest
and
the
river
the
cliff
crowned
with
the
palisades
of
fort
louis
of
the
illinois
as
they
drew
near
a
troop
of
indians
headed
by
a
frenchman
descended
from
the
rock
and
fired
their
guns
to
salute
them
they
landed
and
followed
the
forest
path
that
led
towards
the
fort
when
they
were
met
by
boisrondet
tonty
comrade
in
the
iroquois
war
and
two
other
frenchmen
who
no
sooner
saw
them
than
they
called
out
demanding
where
was
la
salle
cavelier
fearing
lest
he
and
his
party
would
lose
the
advantage
they
might
derive
from
his
character
of
representative
of
his
brother
was
determined
to
conceal
his
death
and
joutel
as
he
himself
confesses
took
part
in
the
deceit
substituting
equivocation
for
falsehood
they
replied
that
la
salle
had
been
with
them
nearly
as
far
as
the
cenis
villages
and
that
when
they
parted
he
was
in
good
health
this
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
was
literally
speaking
true
but
douay
and
teissier
the
one
a
witness
and
the
other
a
sharer
in
his
death
could
not
have
said
so
much
without
a
square
falsehood
and
therefore
evaded
the
inquiry
threading
the
forest
path
and
circling
to
the
rear
of
the
rock
they
climbed
the
rugged
height
and
reached
the
top
here
they
saw
an
area
encircled
by
the
palisades
that
fenced
the
brink
of
the
cliff
and
by
several
dwellings
a
and
a
chapel
there
were
indian
lodges
too
for
some
of
the
red
allies
of
the
french
made
their
abode
with
them
tonty
was
absent
fighting
the
iroquois
but
his
lieutenant
bellefontaine
received
the
travellers
and
his
little
garrison
of
greeted
them
with
a
salute
of
musketry
mingled
with
the
whooping
of
the
indians
a
followed
at
the
chapel
and
with
all
our
hearts
says
joutel
we
gave
thanks
to
god
who
had
preserved
and
guided
us
at
length
the
tired
travellers
were
among
countrymen
and
friends
bellefontaine
found
a
room
for
the
two
priests
while
joutel
teissier
and
young
cavelier
were
lodged
in
the
sidenote
the
jesuit
allouez
the
jesuit
allouez
was
lying
ill
at
the
fort
and
joutel
cavelier
and
douay
went
to
visit
him
he
showed
great
anxiety
when
told
that
la
salle
was
alive
and
on
his
way
to
the
illinois
asked
many
questions
and
could
not
hide
his
agitation
when
some
time
after
he
had
partially
recovered
he
left
louis
as
if
to
shun
a
meeting
with
the
object
of
his
alarm
once
before
in
allouez
had
fled
from
the
illinois
on
hearing
of
the
approach
of
la
salle
the
season
was
late
and
they
were
eager
to
hasten
forward
that
they
might
reach
quebec
in
time
to
return
to
france
in
the
autumn
ships
there
was
not
a
day
to
lose
they
bade
farewell
to
bellefontaine
from
whom
as
from
all
others
they
had
concealed
the
death
of
la
salle
and
made
their
way
across
the
country
to
chicago
here
they
were
detained
a
week
by
a
storm
and
when
at
length
they
embarked
in
a
canoe
furnished
by
bellefontaine
the
tempest
soon
forced
them
to
put
back
on
this
they
abandoned
their
design
and
returned
to
fort
louis
to
the
astonishment
of
its
inmates
sidenote
conduct
of
cavelier
it
was
october
when
they
arrived
and
meanwhile
tonty
had
returned
from
the
iroquois
war
where
he
had
borne
a
conspicuous
part
in
the
famous
attack
on
the
senecas
by
the
marquis
de
denonville
he
listened
with
deep
interest
to
the
mournful
story
of
his
guests
cavelier
knew
him
well
he
knew
so
far
as
he
was
capable
of
knowing
his
generous
and
disinterested
character
his
long
and
faithful
attachment
to
la
salle
and
the
invaluable
services
he
had
rendered
him
tonty
had
every
claim
on
his
confidence
and
affection
yet
he
did
not
hesitate
to
practise
on
him
the
same
deceit
which
he
had
practised
on
bellefontaine
he
told
him
that
he
had
left
his
brother
in
good
health
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
drew
upon
him
in
la
salle
name
for
an
amount
stated
by
joutel
at
about
four
thousand
livres
in
furs
besides
a
canoe
and
a
quantity
of
other
goods
all
of
which
were
delivered
to
him
by
the
unsuspecting
victim
this
was
at
the
end
of
the
winter
when
the
old
priest
and
his
companions
had
been
living
for
months
on
tonty
hospitality
they
set
out
for
canada
on
the
of
march
reached
chicago
on
the
and
thence
proceeded
to
michilimackinac
here
cavelier
sold
some
of
tonty
furs
to
a
merchant
who
gave
him
in
payment
a
draft
on
montreal
thus
putting
him
in
funds
for
his
voyage
home
the
party
continued
their
journey
in
canoes
by
way
of
french
river
and
the
ottawa
and
safely
reached
montreal
on
the
seventeenth
of
july
here
they
procured
the
clothing
of
which
they
were
wofully
in
need
and
then
descended
the
river
to
quebec
where
they
took
lodging
some
with
the
récollet
friars
and
some
with
the
priests
of
the
seminary
in
order
to
escape
the
questions
of
the
curious
at
the
end
of
august
they
embarked
for
france
and
early
in
october
arrived
safely
at
rochelle
none
of
the
party
were
men
of
especial
energy
or
force
of
character
and
yet
under
the
spur
of
a
dire
necessity
they
had
achieved
one
of
the
most
adventurous
journeys
on
record
sidenote
the
colonists
abandoned
now
at
length
they
disburdened
themselves
of
their
gloomy
secret
but
the
sole
result
seems
to
have
been
an
order
from
the
king
for
the
arrest
of
the
murderers
should
they
appear
in
canada
joutel
was
disappointed
it
had
been
his
hope
throughout
that
the
king
would
send
a
ship
to
the
relief
of
the
wretched
band
at
fort
louis
of
texas
but
louis
xiv
hardened
his
heart
and
left
them
to
their
fate

the
lodges
of
the
florida
indians
were
somewhat
similar
the
winter
lodges
of
the
now
nearly
extinct
mandans
though
not
so
high
in
proportion
to
their
width
and
built
of
more
solid
materials
as
the
rigor
of
a
northern
climate
requires
bear
a
general
resemblance
to
those

the

tattooed
their
faces
and
some
parts
of
their
bodies
by
pricking
powdered
charcoal
into
the
skin
the
women
tattooed
the
breasts
and
this
practice
was
general
among
them
notwithstanding
the
pain
of
the
operation
as
it
was
thought
very
ornamental
their
dress
consisted
of
a

of

each
left
an
account
of
this
murder
they
agree
in
essential
points
though
douay
says
that
when
it
took
place
duhaut
had
moved
his

beyond
the

is
contrary
to

are
described
by

all
the

observers
of

of

these

were
a

from

there
learned

of
the

just
arrived
from

of
the
landing
of
la

and
the
loss
of

recounted
by

on

he
immediately
went
back
on

to

prepared

singularly
enough
the

as
printed
by
him
is
erroneous
being

instead
of

is
no
doubt
whatever
from
its
relations
with
concurrent

that

that

who
afterwards
uttered
the
ridiculous
defamation

in

the
account
of
the
death
of

taken
from

his
companions
during
their
stay
at
the
arkansas
couture
was
by
trade
a
carpenter
and
was
a
native
of
rouen
the
condition
of
fort
louis
at
this
time
may
be
gathered
from
several
passages
of
joutel
the
houses
he
says
were
built
at
the
brink
of
the
cliff
forming
with
the
palisades
the

him
at

years

speaks
of

with
emphatic
praise
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
his
connivance
in
the
deception
practised
by
cavelier
on
tonty
leaves
a
shade
on
his
character
as
well
as
on
that
of
douay
in
other
respects
everything
that
appears
concerning
him
is
highly
favorable
which
is
not
the
case
with

on
one

two
occasions
makes
wilful
misstatements
douay
says
that
the
elder
cavelier
made
a
report
of

to
the

seignelay
this
report
remained
unknown

i
obtained
it
by

in
both
the
buyer

seller
being
at

ignorant

it

on

to
be
a

as
by

couture
had
confirmed
what
cavelier
and
his
party
had
already
told
him
that
the
tribes
south
of
the
arkansas
were
eager
to
join
the
french
in
an

soon

letter
informing
him
that
war
had
again
been
declared
against

bold

an
effort

their
necessities

the

to
cross

to

it
was
the
revival
on
a
small
scale
of
la

scheme
of
mexican
invasion
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
with
a
score
of
french
musketeers
he
could
have
gathered
a
formidable
party
of
savage
allies
from
the
tribes
of
red
river
the
sabine
and
the
trinity
this
daring
adventure
and
the
rescue
of
his
suffering
countrymen
divided
his
thoughts
and
he
prepared
at
once
to
execute
the
double
purpose
sidenote
tonty
misrepresented
he
left
fort
louis
of
the
illinois
early
in
december
in
a
pirogue
or
wooden
canoe
with
five
frenchmen
a
shawanoe
warrior
and
two
indian
slaves
and
after
a
long
and
painful
journey
he
reached
the
villages
of
the
caddoes
on
red
river
on
the
of
march
here
he
was
told
that
hiens
and
his
companions
were
at
a
village
eighty
leagues
distant
and
thither
he
was
preparing
to
go
in
search
of
them
when
all
his
men
excepting
the
shawanoe
and
one
frenchman
declared
themselves
disgusted
with
the
journey
and
refused
to
follow
him
persuasion
was
useless
and
there
was
no
means
of
enforcing
obedience
he
found
himself
abandoned
but
he
still
pushed
on
with
the
two
who
remained
faithful
a
few
days
after
they
lost
nearly
all
their
ammunition
in
crossing
a
river
undeterred
by
this
accident
tonty
made
his
way
to
the
village
where
hiens
and
those
who
had
remained
with
him
were
said
to
be
but
no
trace
of
them
appeared
and
the
demeanor
of
the
indians
when
he
inquired
for
them
convinced
him
that
they
had
been
put
to
death
he

them
with
having
killed
the

whereupon
the
women
of
the
village
raised
a
wail
of
lamentation
and
i
saw
he
says
that
what
i
had
said
to
them
was
true
they
refused
to
give
him
guides
and
this
with
the
loss
of
his
ammunition
compelled
him
to
forego
his
purpose
of
making
his
way
to
the
colonists
on
the
bay
of
louis
with
bitter
disappointment
he
and
his
two
companions
retraced
their
course
and
at
length
approached
red
river
here
they
found
the
whole
country
flooded
sometimes
they
waded
to
the
knees
sometimes
to
the
neck
sometimes
pushed
their
slow
way
on
rafts
night
and
day
it
rained
without
ceasing
they
slept
on
logs
placed
side
by
side
to
raise
them
above
the
mud
and
water
and
fought
their
way
with
hatchets
through
the
inundated
they
found
no
game
but
a
bear
which
had
taken
refuge
on
an
island
in
the
flood
and
they
were
forced
to
eat
their
dogs
i
never
in
my
life
writes
tonty
suffered
so
much
in
judging
these
intrepid
exertions
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
he
was
not
at
least
in
appearance
of
a
robust
constitution
and
that
he
had
but
one
hand
they
reached
the
mississippi
on
the
eleventh
of
july
and
the
arkansas
villages
on
the
here
tonty
was
detained
by
an
attack
of
fever
he
resumed
his
journey
when
it
began
to
abate
and
reached
his
fort
of
the
illinois
in
september
sidenote
a
scene
of
havoc
while
the
king
of
france
abandoned
the
exiles
of
texas
to
their
fate
a
power
dark
ruthless
and
terrible
was
hovering
around
the
feeble
colony
on
the
bay
of
louis
searching
with
pitiless
eye
to
discover
and
tear
out
that
dying
germ
of
civilization
from
the
bosom
of
the
wilderness
in
whose
savage
immensity
it
lay
hidden
spain
claimed
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
all
its
coasts
as
her
own
of
unanswerable
right
and
the
viceroys
of
mexico
were
strenuous
to
enforce
her
claim
the
capture
of
one
of
la
salle
four
vessels
at
domingo
had
made
known
his
designs
and
in
the
course
of
the
three
succeeding
years
no
less
than
four
expeditions
were
sent
out
from
vera
cruz
to
find
and
destroy
him
they
scoured
the
whole
extent
of
the
coast
and
found
the
wrecks
of
the
aimable
and
the
belle
but
the
colony
of
louis
inland
and
secluded
escaped
their
search
for
a
time
the
jealousy
of
the
spaniards
was
lulled
to
sleep
they
rested
in
the
assurance
that
the
intruders
had
perished
when
fresh
advices
from
the
frontier
province
of
new
leon
caused
the
viceroy
galve
to
order
a
strong
force
under
alonzo
de
leon
to
march
from
coahuila
and
cross
the
rio
grande
guided
by
a
french
prisoner
probably
one
of
the
deserters
from
la
salle
they
pushed
their
way
across
wild
and
arid
plains
rivers
prairies
and
forests
till
at
length
they
approached
the
bay
of
louis
and
descried
far
off
the
of
the
french
as
they
drew
near
no
banner
was
displayed
no
sentry
challenged
and
the
silence
of
death
reigned
over
the
shattered
palisades
and
neglected
dwellings
the
spaniards
spurred
their
reluctant
horses
through
the
gateway
and
a
scene
of
desolation
met
their
sight
no
living
thing
was
stirring
doors
were
torn
from
their
hinges
broken
boxes
staved
barrels
and
rusty
kettles
mingled
with
a
great
number
of
stocks
of
arquebuses
and
muskets
were
scattered
about
in
confusion
here
too
trampled
in
mud
and
soaked
with
rain
they
saw
more
than
two
hundred
books
many
of
which
still
retained
the
traces
of
costly
bindings
on
the
adjacent
prairie
lay
three
dead
bodies
one
of
which
from
fragments
of
dress
still
clinging
to
the
wasted
remains
they
saw
to
be
that
of
a
woman
it
was
in
vain
to
question
the
imperturbable
savages
who
wrapped
to
the
throat
in
their
stood
gazing
on
the
scene
with
looks
of
wooden
immobility
two
strangers
however
at
length
arrived
their
faces
were
smeared
with
paint
and
they
were
wrapped
in
like
the
rest
yet
these
seeming
indians
were
the
tool
of
la
salle
murderer
duhaut
and
grollet
the
companion
of
the
white
savage
ruter
the
spanish
commander
learning
that
these
two
men
were
in
the
district
of
the
tribe
called
texas
had
sent
to
invite
them
to
his
camp
under
a
pledge
of
good
treatment
and
they
had
resolved
to
trust
spanish
clemency
rather
than
endure
longer
a
life
that
had
become
intolerable
from
them
the
spaniards
learned
nearly
all
that
is
known
of
the
fate
of
barbier
zenobe
membré
and
their
companions
three
months
before
a
large
band
of
indians
had
approached
the
fort
the
inmates
of
which
had
suffered
severely
from
the
ravages
of
the
from
fear
of
treachery
they
refused
to
admit
their
visitors
but
received
them
at
a
cabin
without
the
palisades
here
the
french
began
a
trade
with
them
when
suddenly
a
band
of
warriors
yelling
the
rushed
from
an
ambuscade
under
the
bank
of
the
river
and
butchered
the
greater
number
the
children
of
one
talon
together
with
an
italian
and
a
young
man
from
paris
named
breman
were
saved
by
the
indian
women
who
carried
them
off
on
their
backs
and
grollet
who
with
others
of
their
stamp
were
domesticated
in
the
indian
villages
came
to
the
scene
of
slaughter
and
as
they
affirmed
buried
fourteen
dead
bodies
sidenote
the
survivors
and
grollet
were
sent
to
spain
where
in
spite
of
the
pledge
given
them
they
were
thrown
into
prison
with
the
intention
of
sending
them
back
to
labor
in
the
mines
the
indians
some
time
after
de
leon
expedition
gave
up
their
captives
to
the
spaniards
the
italian
was
imprisoned
at

breman
fate
is
unknown
pierre
and
jean
baptiste

who
were
now
old
enough
to
bear
arms
were
enrolled
in
the
spanish
navy
and
being
captured
in
by
a
french
ship
of
war
regained
their
liberty
while
their
younger
brothers
and
their
sister
were
carried
to
spain
by
the
viceroy
with
respect
to
the
ruffian
companions
of
hiens
the
conviction
of
tonty
that
they
had
been
put
to
death
by
the
indians
may
have
been
well
founded
but
the
buccaneer
himself
is
said
to
have
been
killed
in
a
quarrel
with
his
accomplice
ruter
the
white
savage
and
thus
in
ignominy
and
darkness
died
the
last
embers
of
the
doomed
colony
of
la

sidenote
fruit
of
explorations
here
ends
the
wild
and
mournful
story
of
the
explorers
of
the
mississippi
of
all
their
toil
and
sacrifice
no
fruit
remained
but
a
great
geographical
discovery
and
a
grand
type
of
incarnate
energy
and
will
where
la

had
ploughed
others
were
to
sow
the
seed
and
on
the
path
which
the
undespairing
norman
had
hewn

to
win
for

a
vast
though
a
transient
dominion
footnotes
tonty
two
causes
have
contributed
to
detract
most
unjustly
from
tonty
reputation
the
publication
under
his
name
but
without
his
authority
of
a
perverted
account
of
the
enterprises
in
which
he
took
part
and
the
confounding
him
with
his
brother
alphonse
de
tonty
who
long
commanded
at
detroit
where
charges
of
peculation
were
brought
against
him
there
are
very
few
names
in
history
mentioned
with
such
unanimity
of
praise
as
that
of
henri
de
tonty
hennepin
finds
some
fault
with
him
but
his
censure
is
commendation
the
despatches
of
the
governor
denonville
speak
in
strong
terms
of
his
services
in
the
iroquois
war
praise
his
character
and
declare
that
he
is
fit
for
any
bold
enterprise
adding
that
he
deserves
reward
from
the
king
the
missionary
cosme
who
travelled
under
his
escort
in
says
of
him
he
is
beloved
by
all
the
it
was
with
deep
regret
that
we
parted
from
him
he
is
the
man
who
best
knows
the
country
he
is
loved
and
feared
everywhere
your
grace
will
i
doubt
not
take
pleasure
in
acknowledging
the
obligations
we
owe
him
tonty
held
the
commission
of
captain
but
by
a
memoir
which
he
addressed
to
ponchartrain
in
it
appears
that
he
had
never
received
any
pay
count
frontenac
certifies
the
truth
of
the
statement
and
adds
a
recommendation
of
the
writer
in
consequence
probably
of
this
the
proprietorship
of
fort
louis
of
the
illinois
was
granted
in
the
same
year
to
tonty
jointly
with
la
forest
formerly
la
salle
lieutenant
here
they
carried
on
a
trade
in
furs
in
a
royal
declaration
was
launched
against
the
de
but
an
express
provision
was
added
in
favor
of
tonty
and
la
forest
who
were
empowered
to
send
up
the
country
yearly
two
canoes
with
twelve
men
for
the
maintenance
of
this
fort
with
such
a
limitation
this
fort
and
the
trade
carried
on
at
it
must
have
been
very
small
in
we
find
a
royal
order
to
the
effect
that
la
forest
is
henceforth
to
reside
in
canada
and
tonty
on
the
mississippi
and
that
the
establishment
at
the
illinois
is
to
be
discontinued
in
the
same
year
tonty
joined
in
lower
louisiana

was
sent
by
that
officer
from

to
secure
the
chickasaws
in
the
french
interest
his
subsequent
career
and
the
time
of
his
death
do
not
appear
he
seems
never
to
have
received
the
reward
which
his
great
merit
deserved
those
intimate
with
the
late
lamented

remember
his
wish

justice
should
be
done

this

was
evidently
made
after

he
discovered
the

or
at

the

laid
down
with
the
inscription
river

called

of
its
beauty
which
the
sieur

descended
we
now
come
to
the
map
of
marquette
which
is
a
rude
sketch
of
a
portion
of

michigan
and
of
the
route
pursued
by
him
and

up
the
fox

of

down
the
wisconsin
and
thence
down
the
mississippi
as
far
as
the
arkansas
the
river
illinois
is
also
laid
down
as
it
was
by
this
course
that
he
returned
to
lake
michigan
after
his
memorable
voyage
he
gives
no
name
to
the
wisconsin
the
mississippi
is
called

conception
the
missouri
the
pekitanoui
and
the
ohio
the
ouabouskiaou
though
la
salle
its
discoverer
had
previously
given
it
its
present
name
borrowed
from
the
iroquois
the
illinois
is
nameless
like
the
wisconsin
at
the
mouth
of
a
river
perhaps
the
des

marquette
places
the
three
villages
of
the
peoria
indians
visited
by
him
these
with
the
kaskaskias
maroas
and
others
on
the
map
were
merely
of
the
aggregation
of
savages
known
as
the
illinois
on

near
the
missouri
he
places
the

the

the

the

and
the

the
names
of
many
other
tribes
esloignées

are
also
given
along
the
course
of
the
arkansas
a
river
which
is
nameless
on
the
map
most
of
these
tribes
are
now
indistinguishable
this
map
has
recently
been
engraved
and
published
not
long
after
marquette
return
from
the
mississippi
another
map
was
made
by
the
jesuits
with
the
following
title

this
title
is
very
elaborately
decorated
with
figures
drawn
with
a
pen
and
representing
jesuits
instructing
indians
the
map
is
the
same
published
by
thevenot
not
without
considerable
variations
in
it
represents
the
mississippi
from
a
little
above
the
wisconsin
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
the
part
below
the
arkansas
being
drawn
from
conjecture
the
river
is
named
mitchisipi
ou
grande

the
wisconsin
the
illinois
the
ohio
the
des
moines
the
missouri
and
the
arkansas
are
all
represented
but
in
a
very
rude
manner
route
in
going
and
returning
is
marked
by
lines
but
the
return
route
is
incorrect
the
whole
map
is
so
crude
and
careless
and
based
on
information
so
inexact
that
it
is
of
little
interest
the
jesuits
made
also
another
map
without
title
of
the
four
upper
lakes
and
the
mississippi
to
a
little
below
the
arkansas
the
mississippi
is
called
riuiere
colbert
the
map
is
remarkable
as
including
the
earliest
representation
of
the
upper
mississippi
based
perhaps
on
the
reports
of
indians
the
falls
of
anthony
are
indicated
by
the
word
saut
it
is
possible
that
the
map
may
be
of
later
date
than
at
first
appears
and
that
it
may
have
been
drawn
in
the
interval
between
the
return
of
hennepin
from
the
upper
mississippi
and
that
of
la
salle
from
his
discovery
of
the
mouth
of
the
river
the
various
temporary
and
permanent
stations
of
the
jesuits
are
marked
by
crosses
of
far
greater
interest
is
the
small
map
of
louis
joliet
made
and
presented
to
count
frontenac
after
the
discoverer
return
from
the
mississippi
it

a
part
of

based
on

the
legends
being
here
for
the
most
part
identical
though
the
shape
of
the

is
better
given
by

the

it
ends
in

over
it
states
that

descended

see
joliet
at
about
the
same
time
made
another
map
larger
than
that
just
mentioned
but
not
essentially
different
the

this
map
which
is
inscribed
with
a
dedication
by
the
intendant
duchesneau
to
the
minister
colbert
was
made
some
time
after
the
voyage
of
joliet
and
marquette
it
is
an
elaborate
piece
of
work
but
very
inaccurate
it
represents
the
continent
from
hudson
strait
to
mexico
and
california
with
the
whole
of
the
atlantic
and
a
part
of
the

laid
down
with
tolerable
correctness

most
of
which
can
not
now
be
recognized
though
several
are
clearly
of

the
ohio
is
called
ouaboustikou
the
whole
map
is
decorated
with
numerous
figures
of
animals
natives
of
the
country
or
supposed
to
be
so
among
them
are
camels
ostriches
and
a
giraffe
which
are
placed
on
the
plains
west
of
the
mississippi
but
the
most
curious
figure
is
that
which
represents
one
of
the
monsters
seen
by
joliet
and
marquette
painted
on
a
rock
by
the
indians
it
corresponds
with
description
this
map
which
is
an
early
effort
of
the
engineer
franquelin
does
more
credit
to
his
skill
as
a
designer
than
to
his
geographical
knowledge
which
appears
in
some
respects
behind
his
time
de

some
of
the

the

this

known
to
the
maker
who
seems
to
have
been
franquelin
the
lower
mississippi

omitted
but
its
upper
portions
are
elaborately
laid

side
the
falls
of

are
shown
and
above
them
is
written

this
refers
to
the
de
prise
de
of
du
lhut
in
july
of
that
year
and
this
part
of
the
map
seems
made
from
data
supplied
by
him
we
now
come
to
the
great
map
of
franquelin
the
most
remarkable
of
all
the
early
maps
of
the
interior
of
north
america
though
hitherto
completely
ignored
by
both
american
and
canadian
writers
it
is
entitled

louis
franquelin
franquelin
was
a
young
engineer
who
held
the
post
of
hydrographer
to
the
king
at
quebec
in
which
joliet
succeeded
him
several
of
his
maps
are
preserved
including
one
made
in
in
which
he
lays
down
the
course
of
the
mississippi
the
lower
part
from
conjecture
making
it
discharge
itself
into
mobile
bay
it
appears
from
a
letter
of
the
governor
la
barre
that
franquelin
was
at
quebec
in
engaged
on
a
map
which
was
probably
that
of
which
the
title
is
given
above
though
had
la
barre
known
that
it
was
to
be
called
a
map
of
the
journeys
of
his
victim
la

he
would
have
been
more
sparing
of
his
praises
he
franquelin
writes
the
governor
is
as
skilful
as
any
in
france
but
extremely
poor
and
in
need
of
a
little
aid
from
his
majesty
as
an
engineer
he
is
at
work
on
a
very
correct
map
of
the
country

i
shall
send
you
next
year
in
his
name
meanwhile
i
shall
support
him

some
little
assistance

the
map
is
very
elaborately
executed
and
is
six
feet
long
and
four
and
a
half
wide
it
exhibits
the
political
divisions
of
the
continent
as
the
french
then
understood
them
that
is
to
say
all
the
regions
drained
by
streams
flowing
into
the

and
the
mississippi
are
claimed
as
belonging
to
france
and
this
vast
domain
is
separated
into
two
grand
divisions
la

and
la
louisiane
the
boundary
line
of
the
former
new
france
is
drawn
from
the
penobscot
to
the
southern
extremity
of
lake
champlain
and
thence
to
the
mohawk
which
it
crosses
a
little
above
schenectady
in
order
to
make
french
subjects
of
the
mohawk
indians
thence
it
passes
by
the
sources
of
the
susquehanna
and
the
alleghany
along
the
southern
shore
of

michigan
and

whence
it
sweeps
northwestward
to

been

many
smaller

are
designated
by
names
which
have
been
entirely
forgotten
the
nomenclature
differs
materially
from
that
of
coronelli
map
published
four
years
later
here
the
whole
of
the
french
territory
is
laid
down
as
canada
ou
la

of
which
la
louisiane
forms
an
integral
part
the
map
of
homannus
like
that
of
franquelin
makes
two
distinct
provinces
of
which
one
is
styled
canada
and
the
other
la
louisiane
the
latter
including
michigan
and
the
greater
part
of
new
york
franquelin
gives
the
shape
of
hudson
bay
and
of
all
the
great
lakes
with
remarkable
accuracy
he
makes
the
mississippi
bend
much
too
far
to
the
west
the
peculiar
sinuosities
of
its
course
are
indicated
and
some
of
its
bends
as
for
example
that
at
new
orleans
are
easily
recognized
its
mouths
are
represented
with
great
minuteness
and
it
may
be
inferred
from
the
map
that
since
la
time
they
have
advanced
considerably
into
the
sea
perhaps
the
most
interesting
feature
in
franquelin
map
is
his
sketch
of
la
salle
evanescent
colony
on
the
illinois
engraved
for
this
volume
he
reproduced
the
map
in
for
presentation
to
the
king
with
the
title
de
septentrionale
depuis
le
degré
de
latitude
et
environ
et
degrés
de
longitude
in
this
map
franquelin
corrects
various
errors
in
that
which
preceded
one
of
these
corrections
consists
in
the
removal
of
a
branch
of
the
river
illinois
which
he
had
marked
on
his
first
map
as
will
be
seen
by
referring
to
the
portion
of
it
in
this
book
but
which
does
not
in
fact
exist
on
this
second
map
la
salle
colony
appears
in
much
diminished
proportions
his
indian
settlements
having
in
good
measure
dispersed
two
later
maps
of
new
france
and
louisiana
both
bearing
name
are
preserved
in
the
dépôt
des
cartes
de
la
marine
as
well
as
a
number
of
smaller
maps
and
sketches
also
by
him
they
all
have
more
or
less
of
the
features
of
the
great
map
of
which
surpasses
them
all
in
interest
and
completeness
the
remarkable
manuscript
map
of
the
upper
mississippi
by
le
sueur
belongs
to
a
period
later
than
the
close
of
this
narrative
these
various
maps
joined
to
contemporary
documents
show
that
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
received
at
an
early
date
the
several
names
of
manitoumie
frontenacie
colbertie
and
la
louisiane
this
last
name
which
it
long
retained
is
due
to
la
salle
the
first
use
of
it
which
i
have
observed
is
in
a
conveyance
of
the
island
of
belleisle
made
by
him
to
his
lieutenant
la
forest
in
ii
the
eldorado
of
mathieu
sâgean
father
hennepin
had
among
his
contemporaries
two
rivals
in
the
fabrication
of
new
discoveries
the
first
was
the
noted
la
hontan
whose
book
like
his
own
had
a
wide
circulation
and
proved
a
great
success
la
hontan
had
seen
much
and
portions
of
his
story
have
a
substantial
value
but
his
account
of
his
pretended
voyage
up
the
long
river
is
a
sheer
fabrication
his
long
river
corresponds
in
position
with
the
peter
but
it
corresponds
in
nothing
else
and
the
populous
nations
whom
he
found
on
it
the
eokoros
the
esanapes
and
the
gnacsitares
no
less
than
their
neighbors
the
mozeemlek
and
the
tahuglauk
are
as
real
as
the
nations
visited
by
captain
gulliver
but
la
hontan
did
not
like
hennepin
add
slander
and
plagiarism
to
mendacity
or
seek
to
appropriate
to
himself
the
credit
of
genuine
discoveries
made
by
others
mathieu
sâgean
is
a
personage
less
known
than
hennepin
or
la
hontan
for
though
he
surpassed
them
both
in
fertility
of
invention
he
was
illiterate
and
never
made
a
book
in
being
then
a
soldier
in
a
company
of
marines
at
brest
he
revealed
a
secret
which
he
declared
that
he
had
locked
within
his
breast
for
twenty
years
having
been
unwilling
to
impart
it
to
the
dutch
and
english
in
whose
service
he
had
been
during
the
whole
period
his
story
was
written
down
from
his
dictation
and
sent
to
the
minister
ponchartrain
it
is
preserved
in
the
bibliothèque
nationale
and
in
it
was
printed
by
shea
he
was
born
he
declares
at
la
chine
in
canada
and
engaged
in
the
service
of
la
salle
about
twenty
years
before
the
revelation
of
his
secret
that
is
in
hence
he
would
have
been
at
the
utmost
only
fourteen
years
old
as
la
chine
did
not
exist
before
he
was
with
la
salle
at
the
building
of
fort
louis
of
the
illinois
and
was
left
here
as
one
of
a
hundred
men
under
command
of
tonty
tonty
it
is
to
be
observed
had
but
a
small
fraction
of
this
number
and
sâgean
describes
the
fort
in
a
manner
which
shows
that
he
never
saw
it
being
desirous
of
making
some
new
discovery
he
obtained
leave
from
tonty
and
set
out
with
eleven
other
frenchmen
and
two
mohegan
indians
they
ascended
the
mississippi
a
hundred
and
fifty
leagues
carried
their
canoes
by
a
cataract
went
forty
leagues
farther
and
stopped
a
month
to
hunt
while
thus
employed
they
found
another
river
fourteen
leagues
distant
flowing
they
carried
their
canoes
thither
meeting
on
the
way
many
lions
leopards
and
tigers
which
did
them
no
harm
then
they
embarked
paddled
a
hundred
and
fifty
leagues
farther
and
found
themselves
in
the
midst
of
the
great
nation
of
the
acanibas
dwelling
in
many
fortified
towns
and
governed
by
king
hagaren
who
claimed
descent
from
montezuma
the
king
like
his
subjects
was
clothed
with
the
skins
of
men
nevertheless
he
and
they
were
civilized
and
polished
in
their
manners
they
worshipped
certain
frightful
idols
of
gold
in
the
royal
palace
one
of
them
represented
the
ancestor
of
their
monarch
armed
with
lance
bow
and
quiver
and
in
the
act
of
mounting
his
horse
while
in
his
mouth
he
held
a
jewel
as
large
as
a
goose
egg
which
shone
like
fire
and
which
in
the
opinion
of
sâgean
was
a
carbuncle
another
of
these
images
was
that
of
a
woman
mounted
on
a
golden
unicorn
with
a
horn
more
than
a
fathom
long
after
passing
pursues
the
story
between
these
idols
which
stand
on
platforms
of
gold
each
thirty
feet
square
one
enters
a
magnificent
vestibule
conducting
to
the
apartment
of
the
king
at
the
four
corners
of
this
vestibule
are
stationed
bands
of
music
which
to
the
taste
of
sâgean
was
of
very
poor
quality
the
palace
is
of
vast
extent
and
the
private
apartment
of
the
king
is
or
thirty
feet
square
the
walls
to
the
height
of
eighteen
feet
being
of
bricks
of
solid
gold
and
the
pavement
of
the
same
here
the
king
dwells
alone
served
only
by
his
wives
of
whom
he
takes
a
new
one
every
day
the
frenchmen
alone
had
the
privilege
of
entering
and
were
graciously
received
these
people
carry
on
a
great
trade
in
gold
with
a
nation
believed
by
sâgean
to
be
the
japanese
as
the
journey
to
them
lasts
six
months
he
saw
the
departure
of
one
of
the
caravans
which
consisted
of
more
than
three
thousand
oxen
laden
with
gold
and
an
equal
number
of
horsemen
armed
with
lances
bows
and
daggers
they
receive
iron
and
steel
in
exchange
for
their
gold
the
king
has
an
army
of
a
hundred
thousand
men
of
whom
three
fourths
are
cavalry
they
have
golden
trumpets
with
which
they
make
very
indifferent
music
and
also
golden
drums
which
as
well
as
the
drummer
are
carried
on
the
backs
of
oxen
the
troops
are
practised
once
a
week
in
shooting
at
a
target
with
arrows
and
the
king
rewards
the
victor
with
one
of
his
wives
or
with
some
honorable
employment
these
people
are
of
a
dark
complexion
and
hideous
to
look
upon
because
their
faces
are
made
long
and
narrow
by
pressing
their
heads
between
two
boards
in
infancy
the
women
however
are
as
fair
as
in
europe
though
in
common
with
the
men
their
ears
are
enormously
large
all
persons
of
distinction
among
the
acanibas
wear
their
fingernails
very
long
they
are
polygamists
and
each
man
takes
as
many
wives
as
he
wants
they
are
of
a
joyous
disposition
moderate
drinkers
but
great
smokers
they
entertained
sâgean
and
his
followers
during
five
months
with
the
fat
of
the
land
and
any
woman
who
refused
a
frenchman
was
ordered
to
be
killed
six
girls
were
put
to
death
with
daggers
for
this
breach
of
hospitality
the
king
being
anxious
to
retain
his
visitors
in
his
service
offered
sâgean
one
of
his
daughters
aged
fourteen
years
in
marriage
and
when
he
saw
him
resolved
to
depart
promised
to
keep
her
for
him
till
he
should
return
the
climate
is
delightful
and
summer
reigns
throughout
the
year
the
plains
are
full
of
birds
and
animals
of
all
kinds
among
which
are
many
parrots
and
monkeys
besides
the
wild
cattle
with
humps
like
camels
which
these
people
use
as
beasts
of
burden
king
hagaren
would
not
let
the
frenchmen
go
till
they
had
sworn
by
the
sky
which
is
the
customary
oath
of
the
acanibas
that
they
would
return
in
moons
and
bring
him
a
supply
of
beads
and
other
trinkets
from
canada
as
gold
was
to
be
had
for
the
asking
each
of
the
eleven
frenchmen
took
away
with
him
sixty
small
bars
weighing
about
four
pounds
each
the
king
ordered
two
hundred
horsemen
to
escort
them
and
carry
the
gold
to
their
canoes
which
they
did
and
then
bade
them
farewell
with
terrific
howlings
meant
doubtless
to
do
them
honor
after
many
adventures
wherein
nearly
all
his
companions
came
to
a
bloody
end
sâgean
and
the
few
others
who
survived
had
the
ill
luck
to
be
captured
by
english
pirates
at
the
mouth
of
the
lawrence
he
spent
many
years
among
them
in
the
east
and
west
indies
but
would
not
reveal
the
secret
of
his
eldorado
to
these
heretical
foreigners
such
was
the
story
which
so
far
imposed
on
the
credulity
of
the
minister
ponchartrain
as
to
persuade
him
that
the
matter
was
worth
serious
examination
accordingly
sâgean
was
sent
to
louisiana
then
in
its
earliest
infancy
as
a
french
colony
here
he
met
various
persons
who
had
known
him
in
canada
who
denied
that
he
had
ever
been
on
the
mississippi
and
contradicted
his
account
of
his
parentage
nevertheless
he
held
fast
to
his
story
and
declared
that
the
gold
mines
of
the
acanibas
could
be
reached
without
difficulty
by
the
river
missouri
but
sauvolle
and
bienville
chiefs
of
the
colony
were
obstinate
in
their
unbelief
and
sâgean
and
his
king
hagaren
lapsed
alike

oblivion

parkman
from

taken
in
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
quote
here
from
the
innumerable
tributes
to
so
famous
an
american
author
as
francis
parkman
among
writers
who
have
bestowed
the
highest
praise
upon
his
writings
are
such
names
as
james
russell
lowell
john
fisk
president
charles
eliot
of
harvard
university
george
william
curtis
edward
eggleston
howells
james
schouler
and
conan
doyle
as
well
as
many
prominent
critics
in
the
united
states
in
canada
and
in
england
in
two
respects
francis
parkman
was
exceptionally
fortunate
he
chose
a
theme
of
the
closest
interest
to
his
countrymen
the
colonization
of
the
american
continent
and
the
wars
for
its
possession
and
he
lived
through
fifty
years
of
toil
to
complete
his
great
historical
series
the
text
of
the
new
library
edition
is
that
of
the
latest
issue
of
each
work
prepared
for
the
press
by
the
distinguished
author
he
carefully
revised
and
added
to
several
of
his
works
not
through
change
of
views
but
in
the
light
of
new
documentary
evidence
which
his
patient
research
and
untiring
zeal
extracted
from
the
hidden
archives
of
the
past
thus
he
rewrote
and
enlarged
the
conspiracy
of
pontiac
the
new
edition
of
la
salle
and
the
discovery
of
the
great
west
and
the
edition
of
pioneers
of
france
included
very
important
additions
and
a
short
time
before
his
death
he
added
to
the
old
régime
fifty
pages
under
the
title
of
the
feudal
chiefs
of
acadia
the
new
library
edition
therefore
includes
each
work
in
its
final
state
as
perfected
by
the
historian
the
indexes
have
been
entirely
remade
