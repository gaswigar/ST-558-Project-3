chapter
i
well
all
i
got
to
say
then
is
you
a
very
foolish
woman
ellen
robinson
buttoned
her
long
cloak
forcefully
and
arose
with
a
haughty
air
from
the
where
she
had
pointed
her
remarks
for
the
last
by
swaying
noisily
back
and
forth
and
touching
the
toes
of
her
new
shoes
with
a
click
each
time
to
the
floor
julia
cloud
said
nothing
she
stood
at
the
front
window
looking
out
across
the
sodden
lawn
to
the
road
and
the
gray
sky
in
the
distance
she
did
not
turn
around
to
face
her
arrogant
sister
what
i
like
to
know
is
what
you
do
propose
to
do
then
if
you
do
accept
our
offer
and
come
to
live
with
us
were
you
expecting
to
keep
on
living
in
this
great
barn
of
a
house
ellen
robinson
voice
was
loud
and
strident
with
a
crude
kind
of
pain
she
could
not
understand
her
sister
in
fact
never
had
she
had
thought
her
proposition
that
julia
come
to
live
in
her
home
and
earn
her
board
by
looking
after
the
four
children
and
being
useful
about
the
house
was
most
generous
she
had
admired
the
of
herbert
her
husband
for
suggesting
it
some
husbands
would
have
wanted
a
poor
relative
about
of
course
julia
always
had
been
a
hard
worker
and
it
would
relieve
ellen
and
make
it
possible
for
her
to
go
around
with
her
husband
more
it
would
save
the
wages
of
a
servant
too
for
julia
had
always
been
a
wonder
at
economy
it
certainly
was
vexing
to
have
julia
act
in
this
way
calmly
putting
aside
the
proposition
as
if
it
were
nothing
and
saying
she
had
decided
what
she
was
going
to
do
yet
for
all
the
world
as
if
she
were
a
millionaire
i
do
know
ellen
i
have
had
time
to
think
there
have
been
so
many
things
to
think
about
since
the
funeral
i
have
got
used
yet
to
the
idea
that
mother
really
gone
julia
voice
was
quiet
and
controlled
in
sharp
contrast
with
ellen
nervous
tones
that
it
snapped
ellen
when
you
do
you
go
all
to
pieces
staying
here
alone
in
this
great
barn
that
why
i
want
you
to
decide
now
i
think
you
ought
to
lock
up
and
come
home
with
me
spent
just
as
much
time
away
from
home
as
i
can
spare
the
last
three
weeks
and
i
got
to
get
back
to
my
house
i
ca
stay
with
you
any
more
of
course
not
ellen
i
quite
understand
that
said
julia
turning
around
pleasantly
i
had
expected
you
to
stay
it
is
in
the
least
necessary
you
know
i
not
at
all
afraid
but
it
is
decent
to
leave
you
here
alone
when
you
got
folks
that
can
take
care
of
you
what
will
people
think
it
places
us
in
an
awfully
awkward
position
they
will
simply
think
that
i
have
chosen
to
remain
in
my
own
house
ellen
i
do
see
anything
strange
or
indecent
about
that
julia
cloud
had
turned
about
and
was
facing
her
sister
calmly
now
her
quiet
voice
seemed
to
irritate
ellen
what
nonsense
she
said
sharply
how
exceedingly
childish
letting
yourself
be
ruled
by
whims
when
common
sense
must
show
you
that
you
are
wrong
i
wonder
if
you
are
ever
going
to
be
a
ellen
said
this
word
woman
as
if
her
sister
had
already
passed
into
the
antique
class
and
ought
to
realize
it
it
was
one
of
the
things
that
hurt
julia
cloud
to
realize
that
she
was
growing
old
apparently
without
the
dignity
that
belonged
to
her
years
for
they
all
talked
to
her
yet
as
if
she
were
a
little
child
and
needed
to
be
managed
she
opened
her
lips
to
speak
but
thought
better
of
it
and
shut
them
again
turning
back
to
the
window
and
the
gray
sodden
landscape
well
as
i
said
before
you
a
very
foolish
woman
and
you
soon
find
it
out
i
shall
have
to
go
and
leave
you
to
the
consequences
of
your
folly
i
sure
i
do
know
what
herbert
will
say
when
he
finds
out
how
you
scorned
his
kindness
it
is
every
would
offer
yes
julia
for
i
never
even
suggested
it
to
take
on
extra
expense
in
his
family
but
you
wo
see
your
ingratitude
if
i
stand
here
and
talk
till
doomsday
so
i
going
back
to
my
children
if
you
come
to
your
senses
you
can
ride
out
with
boyce
bains
afternoon
and
i
sure
i
hope
you
wo
regret
this
all
your
life
julia
walked
to
the
door
with
her
sister
and
stood
watching
her
sadly
while
she
climbed
into
her
smart
little
ford
and
skillfully
steered
it
out
of
the
yard
and
down
the
road
the
very
set
of
her
shoulders
as
she
sailed
away
toward
home
was
disapproving
with
a
sigh
of
relief
julia
cloud
shut
the
door
and
went
back
to
her
window
and
the
dreary
landscape
it
was
time
for
a
sunset
but
the
sky
was
leaden
there
would
be
nothing
but
grayness
to
look
at
grayness
in
front
of
her
grayness
behind
in
the
dim
silent
room
it
was
like
her
life
her
long
gray
life
behind
and
ahead
all
her
life
she
had
had
to
serve
and
see
others
happy
first
as
a
child
the
oldest
child
there
had
been
the
other
children
three
brothers
and
ellen
she
had
brought
them
all
up
as
it
were
for
the
mother
had
always
been
delicate
and
ailing
she
had
washed
their
faces
kissed
their
bruises
and
taken
them
to
school
she
had
watched
their
and
sent
them
out
into
the
world
one
by
one
two
of
the
brothers
had
come
home
to
die
and
she
had
nursed
them
through
long
months
the
third
brother
married
a
wealthy
girl
in
california
and
never
came
home
again
except
on
flying
visits
he
was
dead
now
too
killed
in
action
in
france
during
the
first
year
of
the
great
war
then
her
father
had
been
thrown
from
his
horse
and
killed
and
she
had
borne
the
burden
for
her
mother
settled
up
the
estate
and
made
both
ends
meet
somehow
taking
upon
herself
the
burden
of
the
mother
now
a
chronic
invalid
from
time
to
time
her
young
nieces
and
nephews
had
been
thrust
upon
her
to
care
for
in
some
home
stress
and
always
she
had
done
her
duty
by
them
all
through
long
days
of
mischief
and
long
nights
of
illness
she
had
done
it
cheerfully
and
patiently
and
had
never
complained
even
to
herself
always
there
had
been
so
much
to
be
done
that
there
had
been
no
time
to
think
how
the
years
were
going
by
her
youth
passing
from
her
forever
without
even
a
glimpse
of
the
that
she
supposed
was
meant
to
come
into
every
life
for
at
least
a
little
while
she
had
realized
it
fully
she
had
been
so
busy
but
now
with
the
last
service
over
an
empty
house
about
her
an
empty
heart
within
her
she
was
looking
with
startled
eyes
into
the
future
and
facing
facts
it
was
ellen
attempt
to
saddle
her
with
a
new
responsibility
and
fit
her
out
to
drudge
on
to
the
end
of
her
days
that
had
suddenly
brought
the
whole
thing
out
in
its
true
light
she
was
tired
too
tired
to
begin
all
over
again
and
raise
those
children
for
ellen
they
were
nice
healthy
children
and
well
behaved
but
they
were
children
and
always
would
be
if
she
went
out
to
live
with
the
robinsons
she
would
be
ellen
handmaid
at
her
beck
and
call
always
feeling
that
she
must
do
whatever
she
was
asked
whether
she
was
able
or
not
because
she
was
a
dependent
never
anything
for
love
oh
ellen
loved
her
in
a
way
of
course
and
she
loved
ellen
but
they
had
never
understood
each
other
and
ellen
children
had
been
brought
up
to
laugh
and
joke
at
her
expense
as
if
she
were
somehow
mentally
lacking
o
aunt
they
would
say
in
a
tone
of
pity
and
scorn
as
if
she
were
too
ignorant
to
understand
even
their
sneers
perhaps
it
was
pride
but
julia
cloud
felt
she
would
rather
die
than
face
a
future
like
that
it
was
respectable
of
course
and
entirely
reliable
she
would
be
fed
and
clothed
and
nursed
when
she
was
she
would
be
buried
respectably
when
she
died
and
the
neighbors
would
say
the
robinsons
had
been
kind
and
done
the
right
thing
by
her
but
julia
cloud
shuddered
as
she
looked
down
the
long
dull
vista
of
that
future
which
was
offered
her
and
drew
back
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
not
that
she
had
anything
better
in
view
only
that
she
shrank
from
taking
the
step
that
would
bring
inevitable
and
irrevocable
grayness
to
the
end
of
her
days
she
was
not
above
cooking
and
nursing
and
toiling
forever
if
there
were
independence
to
be
had
she
would
have
given
her
life
if
love
beckoned
her
she
would
have
gone
to
france
as
a
nurse
in
a
moment
if
she
had
not
been
needed
at
her
mother
bedside
little
children
drew
her
powerfully
but
to
be
a
drudge
for
children
who
did
not
love
her
in
a
home
where
love
was
the
only
condition
that
would
make
dependence
possible
looked
intolerable
julia
cloud
had
loved
everybody
that
would
let
her
and
had
received
very
little
love
in
return
back
in
the
years
when
she
was
twelve
and
went
to
school
a
boy
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
had
been
her
comrade
and
companion
they
had
played
together
whenever
julia
had
time
to
play
and
had
roamed
the
woods
and
waded
the
creeks
in
company
then
his
people
moved
away
and
he
had
kissed
her
and
told
her
that
some
day
he
was
coming
back
to
get
her
it
was
a
childish
affection
but
it
was
the
only
kiss
of
that
kind
she
had
to
remember
the
boy
had
written
to
her
for
a
whole
year
when
one
day
there
came
a
letter
from
his
grandmother
telling
how
he
was
drowned
in
saving
the
life
of
a
little
child
and
julia
cloud
had
put
the
memory
of
that
kiss
away
as
the
only
bright
thing
in
her
life
that
belonged
wholly
to
herself
and
plodded
patiently
on
the
tears
that
she
shed
in
secret
were
never
allowed
to
trouble
her
family
and
gradually
the
pain
had
grown
into
a
great
calm
no
one
ever
came
her
way
to
touch
her
heart
again
only
little
children
brought
the
wistful
look
to
her
eyes
and
a
wonder
whether
people
had
it
made
up
to
them
in
heaven
when
they
had
failed
of
the
natural
things
of
this
life
julia
cloud
was
not
one
to
pity
herself
she
was
sane
healthy
and
not
naturally
morbid
but
for
some
reason
the
gray
sky
and
the
gray
sodden
earth
and
the
gray
road
of
the
future
had
got
her
in
their
clutches
and
she
could
not
get
away
from
them
with
straining
eyes
she
searched
the
little
bit
of
west
between
the
orchard
tree
that
always
showed
a
sunset
if
there
was
one
but
no
streak
of
orange
rose
or
gold
broke
the
sullen
clouds
well
what
was
she
going
to
do
anyway
ellen
question
seemed
to
ring
on
stridently
in
her
ears
she
tried
to
face
it
looking
down
the
gray
road
into
the
gray
sky
she
had
the
house
but
there
were
taxes
to
pay
and
there
would
be
repairs
every
little
while
to
eat
up
the
infinitesimal
income
which
was
left
her
when
all
the
expenses
of
her
mother
long
illness
and
death
were
paid
they
had
been
spending
their
principal
it
could
not
have
been
helped
in
all
she
knew
she
had
something
like
two
hundred
dollars
a
year
remaining
not
enough
to
board
her
if
she
tried
to
board
anywhere
to
say
nothing
of
clothing
all
this
had
been
fully
and
exhaustively
commented
upon
by
ellen
robinson
during
the
afternoon
the
house
might
be
rented
of
course
though
it
was
too
antiquated
and
to
bring
much
if
julia
was
not
so
ridiculously
sentimental
about
it
julia
had
really
very
little
sentiment
connected
with
the
house
but
ellen
had
chosen
to
think
she
had
so
it
amounted
to
the
same
thing
as
far
as
the
argument
went
julia
knew
in
her
own
heart
that
the
only
thing
that
held
her
to
the
dreary
old
house
with
its
sad
memories
and
its
haunting
emptiness
was
the
fact
that
it
was
hers
and
that
here
she
could
be
independent
and
do
as
she
pleased
if
she
pleased
to
starve
no
one
else
need
know
it
the
big
ache
that
was
in
her
heart
was
the
fact
that
there
was
nobody
really
to
care
if
she
did
starve
even
ellen
solicitations
were
largely
from
duty
and
a
fear
of
what
the
neighbors
would
say
if
she
did
not
look
after
her
sister
julia
was
lonely
and
idle
for
the
first
time
in
her
busy
dull
life
and
her
heart
had
just
discovered
its
and
was
crying
out
in
desolation
she
wanted
something
to
love
and
be
loved
by
she
missed
even
the
peevish
childish
invalid
whose
last
five
years
had
been
little
else
than
a
living
death
with
a
mind
so
vague
and
hazy
as
seldom
to
know
the
faithful
daughter
who
cared
for
her
night
and
day
she
missed
the
heart
and
soul
out
of
life
the
bit
of
color
that
would
glorify
all
living
and
make
it
beautiful
well
to
come
back
to
sordid
things
what
was
there
that
she
could
do
to
eke
out
her
pitiful
little
living
for
live
she
must
since
she
was
here
in
this
bleak
world
and
it
seemed
to
be
expected
of
her
keep
boarders
yes
if
there
were
any
to
keep
but
in
this
town
there
were
few
who
boarded
there
was
nothing
to
draw
strangers
and
the
old
inhabitants
mostly
owned
their
own
houses
she
could
sew
but
there
were
already
more
sewing
women
in
the
community
than
could
be
supported
by
the
work
there
was
to
be
done
for
most
of
the
women
in
sterling
did
their
own
sewing
there
were
two
things
which
she
knew
she
could
do
well
which
everybody
knew
she
could
do
and
for
which
she
knew
ellen
was
anxious
to
have
her
services
she
was
the
best
nurse
in
town
and
a
fine
cook
but
again
the
women
of
sterling
most
of
them
did
their
own
cooking
and
there
was
comparatively
little
nursing
where
a
trained
nurse
would
not
be
hired
in
short
the
few
things
she
could
do
were
not
in
demand
in
this
neighborhood
nevertheless
she
knew
in
her
heart
that
she
intended
trying
to
live
by
her
own
meagre
efforts
going
out
for
a
few
days
nursing
or
to
care
for
some
children
while
their
mothers
went
out
to
dinner
or
to
the
city
to
the
theatre
or
shopping
there
would
be
but
little
of
that
but
perhaps
by
and
by
she
could
manage
to
make
it
the
fashion
as
she
looked
into
the
future
she
saw
herself
trudging
gloomily
down
the
sunset
way
into
a
leaden
sky
caring
for
the
brown
twins
all
day
while
their
mother
was
shopping
while
they
slept
mending
stockings
out
of
the
big
round
basket
that
brown
always
kept
by
her
coming
home
at
night
to
a
cheerless
house
and
a
solitary
meal
for
which
she
had
no
appetite
getting
up
in
the
night
to
go
to
grandma
fergus
taken
down
suddenly
with
one
of
her
attacks
helping
smith
out
with
her
sewing
and
spring
cleaning
menial
monotonous
tasks
many
of
them
not
that
she
minded
that
if
they
only
got
somewhere
and
gave
her
something
from
life
besides
the
mere
fighting
for
existence
she
looked
clear
down
to
the
end
of
her
loveless
life
and
saw
the
neighbors
coming
virtuously
to
perform
the
last
rites
and
wondered
why
it
all
had
to
be
she
was
unaware
of
all
her
years
of
sacrifice
glorious
patience
loving
toil
her
life
seemed
to
have
been
so
without
point
so
useless
heretofore
and
all
that
could
yet
be
how
useless
and
dreary
it
looked
her
spirit
was
at
its
lowest
ebb
her
soul
was
weary
unto
death
she
looked
vainly
for
a
break
in
that
solid
wall
of
cloud
at
the
end
of
the
road
and
looked
so
hard
that
the
tears
came
and
fell
plashing
on
the
and
on
her
thin
tired
hands
it
was
because
of
the
tears
that
she
did
not
see
the
boy
on
a
bicycle
coming
down
the
road
until
he
vaulted
off
at
the
front
gate
left
his
wheel
by
the
curb
and
came
whistling
up
the
path
pulling
a
little
book
and
pencil
out
of
his
pocket
in
a
way
with
a
start
she
brushed
the
tears
away
pushed
back
the
gray
hair
from
her
forehead
and
made
ready
to
go
to
the
door
it
was
johnny
knox
the
little
boy
from
the
telegraph
office
he
had
made
a
mistake
of
course
there
would
be
no
telegram
for
her
it
would
likely
be
for
the
cramers
next
door
johnny
knox
had
not
been
long
in
the
village
and
did
not
know
but
johnny
did
know
telegram
for
miss
julia
cloud
he
announced
smartly
flourishing
the
yellow
envelope
at
her
and
putting
the
pencil
in
her
hand
sign
indicating
a
line
in
the
book
julia
cloud
looked
hard
at
the
envelope
yes
there
was
her
name
though
it
was
against
all
reason
she
could
not
think
of
a
disaster
in
life
of
which
it
might
possibly
be
the
forerunner
telegrams
of
course
meant
death
or
trouble
they
had
never
brought
anything
else
to
her
she
signed
her
name
with
a
vague
wonder
that
there
was
nothing
to
pay
there
had
been
so
many
things
to
pay
during
the
last
two
painful
weeks
and
her
little
funds
were
almost
gone
she
stood
with
the
telegram
in
her
hand
watching
the
boy
go
whistling
back
to
his
wheel
and
riding
off
with
a
careless
whirl
out
into
the
evening
his
whistle
lingered
far
behind
and
her
ears
strained
to
hear
it
now
if
a
whistle
like
that
were
coming
home
to
her
some
one
who
would
be
glad
to
see
her
and
want
something
she
could
do
for
him
why
even
little
impudent
johnny
knox
would
be
a
comfort
if
he
were
all
her
own
her
arms
suddenly
felt
empty
and
her
hands
idle
because
there
was
nothing
left
for
her
to
do
involuntarily
she
stretched
them
out
to
the
gray
dusk
with
a
wistful
motion
then
she
turned
and
went
back
to
the
window
to
read
her
telegram
dear
cloudy
jewel
leslie
and
i
are
on
our
way
east
for
a
visit
and
will
stop
over
wednesday
night
to
see
you
please
make
us
some
caraway
cookies
if
not
too
much
trouble
your
loving
nephew
allison
cloud
a
glad
smile
crept
into
julia
cloud
lonely
eyes
leslie
and
allison
were
her
california
brother
children
who
had
spent
three
happy
months
with
her
when
they
were
five
and
seven
while
their
father
and
mother
went
abroad
cloudy
jewel
was
the
pet
name
they
had
made
up
for
her
that
was
twelve
long
years
ago
and
they
had
not
forgotten
they
were
coming
to
see
her
and
wanted
some
caraway
cookies
a
glad
light
leaped
into
her
face
and
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
the
gray
distance
lo
the
leaden
clouds
had
broken
and
a
streak
of
pale
was
glowing
through
the
bars
of
gray
chapter
ii
leslie
and
allison
julia
cloud
stood
gazing
out
into
the
west
while
the
whole
sky
lightened
and
sank
away
into
dusk
with
a
burning
ruby
on
its
breast
the
gloom
of
her
spirit
glowed
into
brightness
and
joy
flooded
her
soul
leslie
and
allison
what
round
little
warm
bodies
they
had
and
what
delicate
refined
faces
they
had
not
seemed
like
ellen
blowsy
obstreperous
youngsters
practical
and
grasping
to
the
last
extreme
after
the
model
of
their
father
they
had
starry
eyes
and
hair
like
tangled
sunbeams
their
laughter
rippled
like
brooks
in
summer
and
their
hands
were
like
bands
that
bound
the
heart
cookies
and
stories
and
long
walks
and
picnics
those
had
made
up
the
beautiful
days
that
they
spent
with
her
roaming
the
woods
and
meadows
picking
dandelions
and
violets
and
playing
fairy
stories
it
had
been
like
a
brief
return
of
her
old
childish
days
with
her
boy
comrade
she
remembered
the
heartache
and
the
empty
days
after
they
had
gone
back
to
their
western
home
and
the
little
printed
childish
letters
that
came
for
a
few
months
till
she
was
forgotten
but
not
really
forgotten
after
all
for
some
link
of
tenderness
must
still
remain
that
they
should
think
of
her
now
after
all
these
years
of
separation
and
want
to
visit
her
they
remembered
the
cookies
she
smiled
reminiscently
what
a
batch
of
delectable
cookies
she
would
make
in
the
morning
why
would
be
wednesday
they
would
be
here
night
and
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
done
she
turned
from
the
belated
sunset
unregretting
and
hastened
to
begin
her
preparations
there
were
the
two
front
rooms
to
be
prepared
she
would
open
the
windows
at
once
and
let
the
air
sweep
through
all
night
they
had
been
shut
up
a
long
time
for
she
had
brought
the
invalid
to
the
little
the
last
few
months
to
save
steps
and
be
always
within
hearing
the
second
story
had
been
practically
unused
except
when
ellen
or
the
children
were
over
for
a
day
or
two
she
hurried
and
lit
the
gas
in
the
two
rooms
throwing
wide
the
windows
hunting
out
fresh
sheets
and
counterpanes
she
could
dust
and
run
the
over
the
rooms
right
away
and
have
them
in
order
and
that
would
save
time
for
oh
it
was
good
to
have
something
cheerful
to
do
once
more
just
supposing
she
had
yielded
as
once
that
afternoon
she
almost
had
to
ellen
persistent
urgings
and
had
gone
home
with
her
why
the
telegram
might
not
have
reached
her
till
after
the
children
had
come
and
found
the
house
empty
and
gone
again
julia
bustled
around
happily
putting
the
rooms
into
charming
order
hunting
up
a
little
picture
of
the
child
samuel
kneeling
in
the
temple
that
allison
used
to
like
going
to
the
bottom
of
an
old
hair
trunk
for
the
rag
doll
she
had
made
for
leslie
to
cuddle
when
she
went
to
sleep
at
night
ambrose
perkins
across
the
way
looked
uneasily
out
of
her
bedroom
window
at
nine
and
said
to
her
husband
seems
like
julia
cloud
is
staying
up
awful
late
she
got
a
light
in
both
front
rooms
too
there
ca
be
company
i
ellen
and
some
of
her
children
have
stayed
down
after
all
poor
ellen
she
told
me
she
simply
could
spare
the
time
away
from
home
any
longer
but
julia
was
set
on
staying
there
i
never
thought
julia
was
selfish
but
i
she
does
realize
how
hard
it
is
for
ellen
living
that
way
between
two
houses
julia
go
to
live
with
ellen
now
of
course
it
real
good
of
herbert
robinson
to
ask
her
julia
ought
to
appreciate
having
relatives
like
that
relatives
nothing
said
ambrose
pulling
off
his
coat
and
hanging
it
over
a
chair
she
be
a
fool
if
she
goes
she
slaved
all
her
life
and
she
deserves
a
little
rest
now
if
she
goes
out
to
herbert
robinson
she
wo
be
allowed
to
call
her
eyelashes
her
own
you
mark
my
words
well
what
else
can
she
do
said
his
wife
she
has
any
husband
or
children
and
i
think
she
be
mighty
well
off
to
get
a
good
home
men
are
awful
hard
on
each
other
ambrose
i
always
knew
that
julia
cloud
meanwhile
with
a
last
look
at
the
neat
rooms
put
out
her
lights
and
went
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
she
was
so
excited
that
the
darkness
seemed
luminous
about
her
she
was
trying
to
think
how
those
two
children
would
look
grown
up
allison
was
nineteen
and
leslie
nearly
seventeen
now
their
mother
had
been
dead
five
years
and
they
had
been
in
their
guardian
was
an
old
gentleman
a
friend
of
their
mother
that
was
about
all
she
knew
concerning
them
would
they
seem
like
strangers
she
wondered
or
would
there
be
enough
resemblance
to
recall
the
dear
girl
and
boy
of
the
years
that
were
gone
how
she
clung
to
those
cookies
with
hope
there
was
some
remembrance
left
or
they
would
not
have
put
cookies
in
a
telegram
how
impetuous
and
just
like
allison
the
boy
that
telegram
had
sounded
it
was
scarcely
daylight
when
julia
cloud
arose
and
went
down
to
the
kitchen
to
bake
the
cookies
and
the
preparations
she
made
for
baking
pies
and
doughnuts
and
other
toothsome
dainties
would
lead
one
to
suppose
that
she
was
expecting
to
feed
a
regiment
for
a
week
at
least
she
filled
the
day
with
hard
work
as
she
had
been
wont
to
do
and
never
once
thought
of
gray
sunsets
or
dreary
futures
not
even
the
thought
of
her
sister
ellen
came
to
trouble
her
as
she
put
the
house
in
order
filled
her
pantry
with
good
things
to
eat
and
set
the
table
for
three
with
all
the
best
things
the
house
afforded
at
evening
she
stood
once
more
beside
the
front
window
looking
out
sunsetward
there
was
nothing
gray
about
either
sky
or
road
or
landscape
now
there
had
been
brilliant
sunshine
all
day
long
and
the
sky
lay
mellow
and
yellow
behind
the
orchard
with
a
clear
transparent
above
and
a
hint
of
rosy
light
in
the
long
rays
that
reached
their
fingers
along
the
ground
between
the
in
a
few
minutes
the
evening
train
would
be
in
and
there
would
be
rose
in
the
sunset
she
knew
the
signs
and
the
sky
would
be
glorious
they
would
see
it
as
they
came
from
the
train
in
fifteen
minutes
it
would
be
time
for
her
to
put
on
her
hat
and
go
down
to
meet
them
how
her
heart
throbbed
with
anticipation
forebodings
came
to
shadow
her
brightness
suppose
they
should
not
come
suppose
they
were
delayed
or
had
changed
their
minds
and
should
send
another
telegram
saying
so
she
drew
a
deep
breath
and
tried
to
brace
herself
for
the
shock
of
the
thought
she
looked
fearfully
down
the
road
for
a
possible
johnny
knox
speeding
along
with
another
telegram
and
was
relieved
to
see
only
ambrose
perkins
ambling
home
for
supper
followed
by
his
tall
smiling
airedale
there
was
a
shadow
too
that
stood
behind
her
though
she
ignored
it
utterly
it
was
the
thought
of
the
afterwards
when
the
two
bright
young
things
had
been
and
gone
and
she
would
have
to
face
the
gray
in
her
life
again
without
the
rose
but
that
would
be
afterwards
and
this
was
now
ten
minutes
more
and
she
would
go
to
the
station
at
that
minute
a
great
blue
automobile
shot
up
to
the
front
gate
and
stopped
a
big
lump
flew
into
julia
cloud
throat
and
her
hand
went
to
her
heart
had
it
then
come
that
telegram
saying
they
had
changed
their
minds
she
stood
trembling
by
the
window
unable
to
move
but
out
from
the
front
seat
and
the
back
as
if
ejected
from
a
catapult
shot
two
figures
and
flew
together
up
the
front
walk
a
tall
boy
and
a
little
girl
just
as
the
sun
dropped
low
and
swung
a
deep
red
light
into
the
sky
flooding
the
front
yard
with
glory
and
staining
the
heavens
far
up
into
the
blue
they
had
come
they
had
come
before
it
was
yet
julia
cloud
got
herself
to
her
front
door
in
a
tremor
of
delight
and
instantly
four
strong
young
arms
encircled
her
and
nearly
smothered
the
life
out
of
her
o
you
dear
cloudy
jewel
you
look
just
the
same
i
knew
you
would
only
your
hair
is
white
and
pretty
leslie
gurgled
sure
she
is
just
the
same
what
did
i
tell
you
cried
allison
lifting
them
both
and
carrying
them
inside
now
who
on
earth
can
that
be
said
ambrose
perkins
flying
to
her
parlor
window
at
the
first
sound
of
the
automobile
it
is
any
of
them
folks
from
the
city
that
were
out
to
the
funeral
for
there
was
a
car
like
that
there
i
certain
i
mean
to
run
over
and
borrow
a
spoonful
of
soda
pretty
soon
just
to
find
out
it
be
any
of
tom
folks
from
out
west
for
they
could
come
all
that
way
in
a
car
it
must
be
some
of
her
father
relations
from
over
in
maryland
though
i
never
heard
they
were
that
well
off
a
chauffeur
in
livery
the
idea
of
all
that
style
coming
to
see
julia
cloud
no
we
did
come
on
the
train
explained
leslie
eagerly
we
came
in
allison
new
car
luddington
that
our
guardian
was
coming
east
and
he
said
we
might
come
with
him
we
been
dying
to
come
for
ages
and
he
been
promising
allison
he
might
get
this
new
car
so
we
stopped
in
the
city
and
bought
it
and
allison
drove
it
down
of
course
luddington
made
his
man
come
along
he
would
let
us
come
alone
he
gone
up
to
boston
for
three
days
and
when
he
comes
back
he
coming
down
here
to
see
you
leslie
was
talking
as
fast
as
an
express
train
and
julia
cloud
stood
and
admired
her
in
wonder
she
was
slim
and
delicately
pretty
as
ever
with
the
same
mop
of
curls
done
up
in
a
knot
now
and
making
her
look
quaintly
like
the
little
on
a
hot
day
with
her
curls
twisted
on
the
top
of
her
head
for
comfort
she
wore
a
simple
little
straight
frock
of
some
dark
silk
stuff
with
beaded
pockets
and
marvellous
pleats
and
belts
and
straps
in
unexpected
places
such
as
one
sees
in
but
not
on
young
girls
in
the
town
of
sterling
and
her
hat
was
a
queer
little
cap
with
a
knob
of
bright
beads
wonderfully
becoming
but
quite
different
from
anything
that
julia
cloud
had
ever
seen
before
her
movements
were
darting
and
quick
like
a
and
she
wore
long
soft
suède
gloves
and
tiny
high
suède
boots
the
older
woman
watched
her
fascinated
and
you
sure
we
not
being
an
inconvenience
dropping
down
upon
you
in
this
unexpected
way
asked
allison
in
a
quite
voice
and
looking
so
tall
and
handsome
and
responsible
that
julia
cloud
wanted
to
take
him
in
her
arms
and
hug
him
to
make
sure
he
was
the
same
little
boy
she
used
to
tuck
into
bed
at
night
so
soon
after
grandma
death
too
put
in
allison
we
did
know
of
course
till
we
got
about
a
mile
from
sterling
and
stopped
to
ask
the
way
to
the
house
and
a
man
told
us
about
the
funeral
being
monday
we
were
sure
then
but
it
would
be
an
intrusion
you
see
we
left
california
about
two
weeks
ago
and
none
of
our
mail
has
reached
us
yet
so
we
had
heard
you
sure
we
wo
bother
you
a
bit
you
dear
their
aunt
assured
them
rapturously
that
their
coming
was
the
most
blessed
thing
that
could
have
been
just
at
this
time
oh
then
i
relieved
said
leslie
throwing
off
her
hat
and
dropping
into
the
nearest
chair
allison
tell
that
man
to
put
the
car
somewhere
in
a
garage
and
get
back
to
the
city
they
said
there
was
a
train
back
about
this
time
the
man
who
directed
us
told
us
so
no
dear
he
does
need
any
dinner
he
not
used
to
it
till
seven
and
he
be
in
the
city
by
that
time
he
in
a
hurry
to
get
back
cookies
well
yes
you
might
give
him
a
cooky
or
two
if
you
sure
there
be
enough
left
for
us
i
just
dreamed
of
those
cookies
all
these
years
i
so
anxious
to
see
if
they
taste
as
they
did
when
i
was
a
child
may
i
come
with
you
and
see
if
i
remember
where
the
is
oh
joy
allison
just
look
a
whole
crock
and
a
platter
full
is
this
peachy
allison
do
hustle
up
and
get
that
man
off
so
we
can
begin
our
visit
it
was
like
having
a
couple
of
dolls
suddenly
come
alive
and
begin
to
talk
they
talked
so
fast
and
they
took
everything
so
delightfully
for
granted
that
julia
cloud
was
in
a
tremble
of
joy
it
seemed
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
world
that
these
two
strong
handsome
vivid
young
things
should
have
dropped
into
her
life
and
taken
her
into
their
hearts
in
this
way
as
if
she
really
belonged
as
if
they
loved
her
she
was
too
excited
to
talk
she
hardly
knew
what
to
do
first
but
they
did
not
wait
for
her
initiative
allison
was
off
with
his
car
and
his
man
munching
cookies
as
he
went
and
promising
to
return
in
fifteen
minutes
hungry
as
a
bear
now
let
go
you
dear
cloudy
jewel
and
i
smooth
my
hair
for
dinner
i
crazy
to
see
if
i
remember
things
there
was
a
little
red
chair
that
i
used
to
sit
in
it
here
in
your
room
dear
and
the
old
rag
doll
betsey
do
you
remember
her
well
i
should
say
i
did
is
betsey
alive
yet
dear
old
betsey
how
ducky
of
you
to
have
kept
her
for
me
all
these
years
oh
is
it
perfectly
peachy
that
we
could
come
that
we
really
here
at
last
and
you
want
us
you
do
do
you
cloudy
dear
you
sure
you
do
lesley
tone
was
anxious
and
her
bright
brown
eyes
studied
the
older
woman
face
eagerly
but
what
she
saw
there
was
fully
satisfactory
for
she
smiled
and
rattled
joyfully
on
in
the
old
voice
that
reminded
one
so
of
years
ago
i
not
to
tell
you
what
we
really
come
for
till
allison
comes
because
i
promised
and
anyway
he
the
man
and
he
wants
to
tell
you
himself
but
it
the
dandiest
reason
perfectly
peachy
really
a
plan
and
say
cloudy
dear
wo
you
promise
me
right
here
and
now
that
you
will
say
to
what
he
asks
you
if
you
possibly
can
julia
cloud
promised
in
a
maze
of
delight
she
stood
in
hovering
wonder
and
watched
the
mass
of
curls
come
down
and
go
up
again
with
the
swift
manipulation
of
the
slim
white
fingers
remembering
how
she
used
to
comb
those
tangled
curls
with
the
plump
little
body
leaning
sturdily
against
her
knee
it
seemed
to
be
the
first
time
since
she
was
a
child
that
youth
and
beauty
had
come
to
linger
before
her
all
her
experience
had
been
of
sickness
and
suffering
and
death
not
life
and
happiness
there
was
stewed
chicken
and
little
biscuits
with
gravy
for
supper
it
was
a
dish
the
children
used
to
love
it
was
all
dished
up
and
everything
ready
when
allison
came
back
he
reported
that
the
car
was
housed
but
a
block
away
and
the
man
had
gone
to
his
train
tickled
to
death
with
his
cookies
allison
was
so
glad
to
be
back
that
he
had
to
take
his
aunt
in
his
arms
again
and
give
her
a
regular
till
she
pleaded
for
mercy
but
there
was
a
happy
light
in
her
eyes
and
a
bright
color
in
her
cheeks
when
he
released
her
that
made
her
a
very
aunt
indeed
to
sit
down
at
the
table
with
two
such
handsome
children
just
at
that
moment
ellen
robinson
in
her
own
home
was
pouring
her
husband
second
cup
of
coffee
do
you
think
i
better
take
the
car
and
run
down
for
julia
before
dark
she
said
i
think
she
be
about
ready
to
come
back
with
me
by
this
time
and
i
need
her
early
in
the
morning
if
i
going
to
begin
cleaning
house
better
wait
one
more
night
said
herbert
stolidly
let
her
get
her
fill
of
staying
alone
nights
it
do
her
good
we
do
want
her
to
be
high
and
mighty
when
she
gets
here
i
boss
here
and
she
got
to
understand
that
she
so
mighty
independent
you
know
it
important
she
should
find
that
out
right
at
the
start
i
not
going
to
have
her
get
bossy
with
these
children
either
they
are
her
children
four
pairs
of
keen
little
robinson
eyes
took
in
this
saying
with
quick
intelligence
and
four
stolid
sets
of
shoulders
straightened
up
importantly
with
four
uplifted
saucy
chins
they
would
store
these
remarks
away
for
future
reference
when
the
aunt
in
question
arrived
on
the
scene
they
would
come
in
well
they
knew
for
they
had
had
experience
with
her
in
times
past
aunt
jule
ai
goin
to
boss
me
swaggered
the
youngest
ner
me
neither
ner
me
i
guess
she
would
try
it
on
boasted
the
eldest
chapter
iii
you
have
asked
us
what
we
came
for
opened
up
allison
as
soon
as
everybody
was
served
with
chicken
mashed
potato
succotash
stewed
tomatoes
biscuits
pickles
and
i
thought
you
came
for
cookies
said
julia
cloud
with
a
mischievous
twinkle
in
her
gray
eyes
hung
one
on
me
did
you
said
allison
laughing
but
that
all
guess
again
perhaps
you
came
to
see
me
she
suggested
shyly
right
you
are
but
that
not
all
either
that
would
last
much
longer
than
the
cookies
guess
again
oh
i
could
said
julia
cloud
growing
suddenly
stricken
with
the
thought
of
their
going
i
give
it
up
well
then
i
tell
you
you
see
we
come
east
to
college
both
of
us
of
course
i
had
my
freshman
year
but
the
kid
just
entering
we
have
decided
which
college
it
to
be
yet
but
it
to
be
we
know
that
much
because
we
tired
of
being
separated
when
one
has
but
two
in
the
family
and
has
been
apart
for
five
years
one
appreciates
a
home
i
tell
you
that
and
so
we
decided
we
want
a
home
we
not
just
going
to
college
to
live
there
in
the
usual
way
we
going
to
take
a
house
live
like
real
folks
and
go
to
school
every
day
we
want
a
fireplace
and
a
of
our
own
a
place
to
bring
our
friends
and
have
good
times
but
most
of
all
we
want
a
mother
and
we
come
all
this
way
to
coax
you
to
come
and
live
with
us
play
house
you
know
as
you
used
to
do
down
on
the
mossy
rocks
with
broken
bits
of
china
for
dishes
and
acorns
for
cups
and
saucers
play
house
and
you
be
mother
will
you
do
it
cloudy
jewel
it
means
a
whole
lot
to
us
and
we
try
to
play
fair
and
make
you
have
a
good
time
julia
cloud
put
her
hand
on
her
heart
and
lifted
her
bewildered
eyes
to
the
boy
eager
face
me
she
said
wonderingly
you
want
we
sure
do
said
allison
indeed
we
do
cloudy
dear
that
just
what
we
do
want
cried
leslie
jumping
up
and
running
around
to
her
aunt
chair
to
embrace
her
excitedly
and
you
promised
you
know
that
you
would
do
what
we
wanted
if
you
possibly
could
you
see
we
put
it
up
to
our
guardian
about
the
house
went
on
allison
and
he
said
the
difficulty
would
be
to
get
the
right
kind
of
a
housekeeper
that
he
could
trust
us
with
of
course
he
way
off
in
california
and
he
has
to
be
fussy
he
built
that
way
but
we
told
him
we
did
want
any
housekeeper
at
all
we
wanted
a
mother
he
said
you
could
pick
mothers
off
trees
but
we
told
him
we
knew
where
there
was
one
if
we
could
only
get
her
so
he
let
us
come
and
ask
and
if
you
say
you
do
it
he
coming
down
to
see
you
and
fix
it
up
about
the
money
part
he
said
you
have
to
have
a
regular
salary
or
he
would
consider
it
because
there
were
things
he
have
to
insist
upon
that
he
had
promised
mother
and
if
there
was
a
business
arrangement
about
it
he
would
know
what
to
do
besides
he
said
it
was
worth
a
lot
to
run
a
couple
of
like
les
and
me
and
he
make
the
salary
all
right
so
you
could
afford
to
leave
whatever
you
were
doing
and
just
give
your
time
to
mothering
us
now
it
up
to
you
cloudy
jewel
to
help
us
out
with
our
proposition
or
spoil
everything
because
we
simply
wo
have
a
housekeeper
and
we
do
know
another
real
mother
in
the
whole
world
that
has
a
family
of
her
own
they
both
left
their
delicious
dinner
and
got
around
her
coaxing
and
wheedling
exactly
as
if
she
had
already
declined
when
the
truth
was
she
was
too
dazed
with
joy
to
open
her
lips
even
if
they
had
given
her
opportunity
to
speak
it
was
some
time
before
the
excitement
quieted
down
and
they
gave
her
a
chance
to
say
she
would
go
even
then
she
spoke
the
words
with
fear
and
trembling
as
one
might
step
off
a
commonplace
threshold
into
a
fairy
palace
not
sure
but
it
might
be
stepping
into
space
outside
the
sky
was
still
flooded
with
glory
but
there
was
so
much
glory
in
the
hearts
of
the
three
inside
the
that
they
never
noticed
it
at
all
it
might
have
been
raining
or
hailing
and
they
would
not
have
known
they
were
so
happy
both
the
guests
donned
long
gingham
aprons
and
wiped
the
dishes
when
the
meal
was
over
both
talking
with
all
their
might
recalling
the
days
of
their
childhood
when
they
had
had
towels
pinned
around
them
and
been
allowed
to
dry
the
cups
and
pans
then
suddenly
jumping
ahead
and
planning
what
they
would
do
in
the
dear
new
home
of
the
future
they
were
all
three
as
excited
about
it
as
if
they
had
been
a
bridal
couple
planning
for
their
honeymoon
we
shall
want
five
bedrooms
said
leslie
decidedly
i
thought
that
all
out
one
for
each
of
us
and
two
so
we
can
have
a
boy
and
a
girl
home
for
overnight
with
us
as
often
as
we
want
to
and
there
simply
must
be
a
fireplace
or
we
wo
take
the
house
if
there
is
the
right
kind
of
a
house
in
town
we
choose
some
other
college
there
are
plenty
of
colleges
but
you
can
have
only
one
home
and
it
must
be
the
right
kind
then
of
course
we
want
a
big
kitchen
where
we
can
make
fudge
as
often
as
we
choose
in
the
evenings
and
a
with
a
with
seats
and
flowers
and
a
canary
cloudy
jewel
you
do
mind
cats
do
you
i
want
two
at
least
been
crazy
for
a
kitten
all
the
time
i
was
in
school
and
al
wants
a
big
collie
you
wo
mind
will
you
suddenly
julia
cloud
discovered
that
latent
in
her
heart
all
these
years
there
had
also
lain
a
desire
for
a
cat
and
a
dog
and
she
lifted
guilty
eyes
and
confessed
it
she
felt
a
pang
of
remembrance
as
she
recalled
how
her
mother
used
so
often
to
tell
her
she
was
nothing
but
an
old
child
perhaps
your
guardian
will
not
think
me
a
proper
person
to
chaperon
you
she
suggested
in
sudden
alarm
well
he
just
better
not
declared
allison
bristling
up
like
to
know
where
he
could
find
a
better
i
never
been
in
society
said
julia
cloud
thoughtfully
i
know
social
ways
much
and
i
never
been
considered
to
have
any
dignity
or
good
judgment
that
just
why
we
like
you
chorused
the
children
you
never
grown
up
and
got
dull
and
stiff
and
poky
like
most
grown
folks
we
were
so
afraid
began
leslie
putting
a
loving
arm
about
her
aunt
waist
that
you
would
have
changed
since
we
were
children
we
talked
it
all
over
on
the
way
here
we
had
a
kind
of
eyebrow
code
by
which
we
could
let
each
other
know
what
we
thought
about
it
without
your
seeing
us
we
were
to
lift
one
eyebrow
the
right
one
if
we
were
favorably
impressed
and
draw
down
the
left
if
we
were
disappointed
but
in
case
we
were
sure
both
eyebrows
were
to
go
up
and
of
course
we
were
sure
you
were
just
the
same
dear
the
minute
we
laid
eyes
on
you
and
all
four
of
our
eyebrows
went
high
as
they
go
the
first
instant
did
you
notice
allison
his
eyebrows
were
almost
up
to
his
hair
and
they
pulled
his
eyes
so
wide
open
they
were
perfectly
round
like
saucers
as
for
me
i
think
mine
went
way
up
under
my
hair
i
not
sure
if
they
got
back
to
their
natural
place
even
yet
and
leslie
laid
a
rosy
finger
over
her
brow
and
felt
anxiously
along
the
delicate
velvety
line
i
shall
go
out
and
telegraph
luddington
that
you
are
willing
announced
allison
as
he
hung
up
the
he
get
it
in
the
morning
when
he
reaches
boston
and
then
he
need
fuss
and
fume
any
longer
about
what
he
going
to
do
with
us
besides
i
like
to
have
the
bargain
clinched
somehow
and
a
telegram
will
do
it
allison
slammed
out
of
the
house
noisily
to
the
extreme
confusion
of
ambrose
perkins
who
had
been
able
to
eat
her
supper
properly
for
watching
the
house
to
see
what
would
happen
next
who
could
that
young
man
be
she
simply
could
get
a
clew
for
when
she
went
over
for
the
soda
though
she
knocked
several
times
and
heard
voices
and
altogether
unseemly
laughter
for
a
house
where
there
had
just
been
a
funeral
not
a
soul
came
to
the
door
could
it
be
that
julia
cloud
heard
her
and
stayed
on
purpose
she
felt
that
as
the
nearest
neighbor
and
a
great
friend
of
ellen
it
would
be
rather
expected
of
her
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
she
resolutely
refrained
from
lighting
the
parlor
lamp
and
took
up
her
station
at
the
dark
window
to
watch
but
although
she
sat
there
until
after
ten
she
was
utterly
unable
to
find
out
anything
except
that
the
household
across
the
way
stayed
up
very
late
and
there
were
lights
in
both
front
rooms
again
she
felt
that
if
nothing
developed
by
morning
she
would
just
have
to
get
ambrose
to
hitch
up
and
drive
out
to
ellen
ellen
ought
to
know
but
julia
cloud
was
serenely
unconscious
of
this
espionage
she
had
entered
an
eden
of
bliss
and
was
too
happy
to
care
about
anything
else
seated
on
the
big
old
couch
in
the
parlor
with
a
child
on
either
side
of
her
a
hand
in
each
of
hers
often
a
head
on
each
shoulder
nestling
down
they
talked
planned
and
talked
now
the
brother
would
break
in
with
some
tale
of
his
now
the
sister
would
add
a
bit
of
reminiscence
just
as
if
they
had
been
storing
it
all
up
to
tell
her
the
joyous
happiness
of
them
all
seemed
like
heaven
dropped
down
to
earth
it
was
as
she
had
sometimes
dreamed
mothers
might
talk
with
their
own
children
and
god
had
granted
this
unspeakable
gift
to
her
was
it
real
would
it
last
or
was
she
only
dreaming
once
it
vaguely
passed
through
her
mind
that
she
would
not
be
sure
of
the
reality
of
the
whole
thing
until
she
had
seen
ellen
if
she
could
talk
with
ellen
about
it
tell
her
what
she
was
going
to
do
show
her
the
children
and
then
come
back
and
find
it
all
the
same
it
would
last
but
somehow
she
shrank
unspeakably
from
seeing
ellen
she
could
not
get
away
from
the
feeling
that
ellen
would
dispel
it
all
that
someway
somehow
she
would
succeed
in
breaking
up
all
the
bright
plans
and
scattering
them
like
in
the
wind
nevertheless
it
was
a
very
beautiful
illusion
if
illusion
it
was
and
one
to
be
prolonged
as
late
as
possible
she
was
horrified
when
at
last
she
heard
the
rebuking
strokes
of
the
town
clock
ten
eleven
she
started
to
her
feet
ashamed
and
even
then
they
would
not
let
her
go
to
bed
at
once
she
must
turn
out
the
lights
and
sit
in
the
hall
between
their
rooms
as
she
did
long
ago
and
tell
the
story
of
the
little
rid
hin
just
as
she
had
told
it
night
after
night
when
they
were
children
it
was
characteristic
of
the
unfailing
youth
of
the
woman
that
she
entered
into
the
play
with
zest
attired
in
a
long
kimono
with
her
beautiful
white
hair
in
two
long
silver
braids
down
over
her
shoulders
she
sat
in
the
dark
and
told
the
story
with
the
same
vivid
language
and
then
she
stole
on
tiptoe
first
to
the
sister
bedside
to
tuck
her
in
and
kiss
her
softly
and
then
to
the
brother
and
at
each
bedside
a
young
strong
arm
reached
out
and
drew
her
face
down
whispering
with
a
kiss
and
i
love
you
cloudy
jewel
in
tender
thrilling
tones
the
two
big
children
were
asleep
at
last
and
julia
cloud
stole
to
her
own
bed
to
lie
in
a
tumult
of
wonder
and
joy
and
finally
sink
into
a
light
slumber
wherein
she
dreamed
that
she
had
fallen
heir
to
a
and
all
the
roses
were
alive
and
could
talk
until
ellen
came
driving
up
in
her
ford
and
ran
right
over
them
crushing
them
down
and
cutting
their
heads
off
with
a
long
sharp
whip
she
carried
that
somehow
turned
out
to
be
made
of
words
strung
together
with
biting
sarcasm
she
awoke
in
the
broad
morning
sunlight
to
find
both
children
done
up
in
and
slippers
sitting
one
each
side
of
her
on
the
bed
laughing
at
her
and
tickling
her
chin
with
a
feather
from
the
seam
of
the
pillow
now
cloudy
jewel
you
just
got
to
begin
to
make
plans
announced
leslie
curling
up
in
a
ball
at
her
feet
and
looking
very
with
her
fluffy
curls
around
her
face
like
a
golden
fleece
there
is
much
time
and
guardy
lud
will
be
down
upon
us
by
or
the
next
day
at
least
guardy
lud
exclaimed
julia
cloud
bewildered
who
is
that
that
our
pet
name
for
luddington
explained
leslie
wrinkling
up
her
nose
in
a
grin
of
merriment
is
it
cute
wait
till
you
see
him
and
you
see
how
it
fits
he
round
and
bald
with
a
shiny
red
nose
and
spectacles
and
he
does
mind
our
kidding
at
all
have
made
a
lovely
father
if
he
was
married
but
he
has
a
horrid
wife
we
do
like
her
at
all
she
like
a
frilly
piece
of
french
china
with
too
much
decoration
and
she
always
sick
and
nervous
and
she
jumps
and
says
mercy
every
time
we
do
the
least
little
thing
she
does
like
us
any
better
than
we
like
her
her
name
is
alida
and
allison
says
we
always
trying
to
her
the
only
good
thing
she
ever
did
was
to
advise
guardy
lud
to
let
us
come
east
to
college
she
wanted
to
get
us
as
far
away
from
her
as
possible
and
it
certainly
was
mutual
there
now
leslie
you
chattering
again
broke
in
allison
looking
very
tall
and
efficient
in
his
blue
you
said
you
would
talk
business
and
not
bleat
well
so
i
am
pouted
leslie
i
guess
cloudy
has
got
to
understand
about
our
family
well
now
let
get
down
to
business
said
her
brother
cloudy
what
have
you
got
to
do
before
you
leave
you
know
it
is
very
long
before
the
colleges
open
and
we
got
to
start
out
and
hunt
a
home
right
away
do
you
have
to
pack
up
here
or
anything
oh
i
do
know
gasped
julia
cloud
looking
around
half
frightened
i
suppose
i
ought
to
ask
ellen
she
will
be
very
much
opposed
to
anything
i
do
but
i
suppose
she
ought
to
be
told
first
allison
frowned
gee
whiz
i
do
see
why
aunt
ellen
has
to
butt
into
our
affairs
she
got
her
own
home
and
family
and
she
never
did
like
us
very
much
i
remember
hearing
her
tell
grandma
that
we
were
a
regular
nuisance
and
she
would
be
glad
when
we
were
gone
back
to
california
that
was
because
you
hid
behind
the
sofa
when
uncle
herbert
was
courting
her
and
kidded
them
giggled
leslie
a
stray
little
twinkle
of
a
dimple
peeped
out
by
the
corner
of
julia
cloud
mouth
it
had
been
out
for
a
number
of
years
and
she
knew
she
ought
not
to
laugh
at
such
pranks
now
but
it
was
so
funny
to
think
of
herbert
robinson
being
kidded
in
the
midst
of
his
courting
the
dimple
started
the
lights
dancing
in
leslie
eyes
there
now
you
dear
old
jewel
you
know
you
do
want
to
talk
to
aunt
ellen
about
us
she
just
mess
things
all
up
let
just
things
and
get
all
fixed
up
and
then
tell
her
when
it
too
late
for
her
to
make
a
fuss
gurgled
leslie
down
close
to
julia
ear
finishing
up
with
a
delicious
i
suppose
she
be
mortally
offended
murmured
julia
cloud
in
troubled
hesitancy
well
suppose
she
is
she
get
over
it
wo
she
growled
allison
and
anyhow
you
old
enough
to
manage
your
own
affairs
cloudy
jewel
i
guess
you
older
than
she
is
are
you
i
guess
you
got
a
right
to
do
as
you
please
have
you
and
you
want
to
go
with
us
do
you
his
voice
was
anxious
i
certainly
do
dear
boy
said
julia
cloud
eagerly
but
you
know
your
guardian
may
not
approve
at
all
when
he
sees
what
a
foolish
aunt
i
am
allowing
you
to
sit
up
late
and
talk
fairy
stories
all
the
time
they
smothered
her
in
kisses
compliments
and
assurances
and
it
was
some
time
before
the
conversation
swung
around
again
to
the
important
subject
of
the
morning
you
do
have
to
do
anything
to
the
house
but
just
shut
it
up
do
you
asked
allison
looking
anxiously
about
in
a
helpless
mannish
way
because
if
you
do
we
ought
to
be
getting
to
work
there
a
man
over
at
harmony
village
that
wanted
to
rent
a
house
here
said
julia
cloud
thoughtfully
i
might
write
a
letter
to
him
i
do
know
whether
he
found
anything
or
not
he
the
new
superintendent
of
the
high
school
but
it
time
we
got
dressed
and
had
breakfast
write
to
him
nothing
said
allison
eagerly
i
get
the
car
and
we
drive
over
to
harmony
in
no
time
and
get
the
thing
fixed
up
hustle
there
leslie
and
get
yourself
togged
up
we
do
need
to
wait
for
breakfast
we
can
eat
cookies
hurry
everybody
and
he
slammed
over
to
his
own
room
and
began
to
stir
about
noisily
julia
cloud
arose
and
made
a
hasty
toilet
with
a
bright
spot
of
excitement
on
each
cheek
but
she
had
no
time
to
think
what
ellen
would
say
for
she
meant
that
these
children
should
have
a
real
breakfast
before
they
began
the
day
and
now
that
she
was
up
her
little
round
black
clock
on
the
bureau
told
her
that
it
was
high
time
the
day
had
begun
she
looked
fearfully
out
of
the
window
half
expecting
to
see
ellen
ford
bobbing
down
the
hill
already
and
then
hurried
down
to
the
kitchen
allison
soon
came
down
calling
out
to
her
to
be
ready
when
he
came
back
with
the
car
but
the
delicious
odors
that
had
already
begun
to
float
out
from
the
old
kitchen
made
him
lenient
toward
the
idea
of
breakfast
and
when
he
came
back
with
the
full
roaring
the
announcement
of
his
arrival
to
the
perkinses
he
was
quite
ready
to
wait
a
few
minutes
and
eat
some
of
julia
cloud
flapjacks
and
sausages
with
and
julia
cloud
herself
ate
little
she
was
in
a
tremor
of
delightful
uncertainty
and
dread
ought
she
to
go
ahead
this
way
and
manage
her
own
affairs
leaving
her
own
sister
out
of
the
question
but
then
if
she
consulted
with
ellen
that
meant
consulting
with
herbert
for
herbert
ran
his
wife
most
thoroughly
and
herbert
could
make
things
very
unpleasant
when
he
took
the
trouble
so
when
the
children
unable
at
last
to
eat
any
more
pleaded
with
her
to
leave
the
dishes
and
go
to
see
the
man
about
the
house
at
once
she
gave
one
swift
apprehensive
glance
about
and
assented
if
ellen
should
come
to
the
house
while
they
were
away
and
should
look
in
at
the
window
and
see
the
breakfast
dishes
standing
it
would
be
appalling
but
as
the
children
said
why
worry
somehow
she
felt
like
a
little
schoolgirl
playing
hookey
as
she
carefully
drew
down
the
and
kitchen
that
looked
on
the
back
porch
and
locked
the
front
door
behind
her
well
perhaps
she
had
earned
the
right
to
take
this
bit
of
a
holiday
and
wash
her
dishes
when
she
liked
anyhow
had
god
sent
these
blessed
children
to
her
in
answer
to
her
earnest
prayer
that
he
would
show
her
what
to
do
and
save
her
if
possible
from
having
to
spend
the
remainder
of
her
days
under
herbert
robinson
roof
well
then
she
would
just
accept
it
that
way
and
be
grateful
at
least
until
he
showed
her
otherwise
so
she
drew
a
long
breath
of
delight
and
climbed
into
the
luxurious
back
seat
of
the
great
blue
car
utterly
oblivious
of
the
prying
eyes
behind
the
parlor
shade
across
the
way
chapter
iv
down
the
little
village
street
past
the
station
and
across
the
railroad
toward
harmony
swept
the
great
blue
car
with
the
villagers
turning
to
stare
at
miss
cloud
taking
a
ride
so
early
in
the
morning
in
so
gaudy
a
car
so
soon
after
the
funeral
and
even
without
a
veil
a
few
minutes
later
ellen
in
her
ford
rattled
up
to
the
door
and
got
out
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
come
to
do
things
she
walked
confidently
up
to
the
front
door
and
tried
it
rattled
it
knocked
and
then
went
angrily
around
to
the
back
trying
all
the
doors
and
windows
perkins
from
her
parlor
window
watched
a
minute
and
when
she
saw
ellen
come
around
to
the
front
again
and
look
up
at
the
second
story
she
threw
a
shawl
around
her
shoulders
and
ran
across
the
street
to
impart
faithfully
her
story
for
the
land
sake
said
ellen
indignantly
what
can
julia
be
about
mother
always
said
she
never
would
grow
up
and
i
believe
it
i
was
afraid
when
i
went
away
she
had
some
scheme
in
her
mind
always
getting
up
fool
ideas
i
remember
that
time
when
marsh
died
she
wanted
to
adopt
the
twins
and
bring
them
up
the
idea
when
there
was
a
county
poorhouse
and
no
reason
why
they
should
go
to
it
but
she
have
to
come
down
off
her
independence
and
be
sensible
herbert
says
we
ca
have
any
of
her
foolishness
it
us
that
would
have
to
suffer
if
she
got
into
trouble
and
lost
what
little
got
and
i
suppose
i
got
to
have
it
out
with
her
once
and
for
all
and
get
this
thing
settled
it
getting
on
all
our
nerves
and
got
the
fall
and
jelly
to
do
and
i
ca
fool
around
any
longer
well
i
suppose
i
better
try
to
get
into
this
house
have
you
got
any
keys
that
might
fit
perkins
hurried
over
for
all
her
keys
including
and
soon
they
had
tried
every
door
and
every
key
with
no
effect
and
had
to
call
in
the
youngest
perkins
and
boost
him
up
to
the
window
under
the
guise
of
looking
after
julia
cloud
the
two
good
ladies
invaded
her
home
and
proceeded
to
investigate
the
parlor
and
the
hall
gave
forth
no
secrets
except
for
a
couple
of
handsome
raincoats
slung
carelessly
upon
chairs
but
the
oh
the
if
julia
cloud
could
have
seen
their
faces
as
they
swung
open
that
carefully
closed
door
and
stood
upon
the
threshold
aghast
looking
at
the
wreck
of
the
breakfast
she
would
have
cringed
and
shivered
even
on
her
way
to
harmony
but
julia
cloud
could
not
see
she
was
safely
over
the
bridge
and
out
on
the
highway
where
she
would
not
be
likely
to
be
followed
and
the
wine
of
the
morning
was
rising
in
her
veins
such
wonderful
air
such
clear
blue
sky
and
flying
clouds
she
felt
like
a
flying
cloud
herself
as
she
sped
along
in
the
great
blue
car
with
the
chatter
of
the
children
in
her
ears
and
the
silvery
laughter
of
leslie
by
her
side
how
could
she
help
smiling
and
letting
her
cheeks
grow
pink
and
her
eyes
grow
bright
too
soon
after
a
funeral
the
thought
did
come
to
her
but
she
knew
by
the
thrill
of
her
heart
that
her
mother
in
heaven
was
gladder
now
than
she
had
been
for
years
of
her
bedridden
life
on
earth
and
if
she
could
look
down
to
see
would
no
doubt
be
happy
that
some
joy
was
coming
to
her
daughter
at
last
julia
would
just
enjoy
this
day
and
this
delight
to
the
full
while
it
lasted
if
it
was
not
meant
to
last
longer
than
the
day
at
least
she
would
have
this
wonderful
ride
to
remember
always
this
motion
as
if
she
were
floating
through
a
panorama
not
a
thought
of
ellen
poking
through
her
house
finding
unswept
hearth
and
unmade
beds
and
unwashed
dishes
came
to
trouble
her
joy
it
was
as
if
the
childhood
of
her
life
long
held
in
abeyance
had
come
back
to
her
and
would
not
be
denied
ellen
and
perkins
in
their
inspection
of
the
house
came
at
last
to
the
upper
story
and
the
guests
room
strewn
with
brushes
bearing
silver
monograms
and
elaborate
appointments
of
travel
that
kept
them
guessing
their
use
and
exclaiming
in
wonder
and
horror
that
any
one
would
spend
so
much
on
little
details
leslie
charming
silk
negligée
and
her
frilly
little
nightgown
with
its
lace
and
floating
ribbons
came
in
for
a
large
amount
of
contempt
and
it
was
some
time
before
the
good
ladies
arrived
at
julia
cloud
room
and
found
the
open
telegram
on
her
bureau
that
gave
the
key
to
the
mystery
of
the
two
visitors
h
said
ellen
so
that
it
well
i
thought
she
had
some
bee
in
her
bonnet
she
must
have
written
to
them
or
they
never
would
have
come
now
i
suppose
she
means
to
keep
them
all
winter
perhaps
and
feed
them
and
baby
them
up
and
when
she
has
spent
all
she
has
she
come
back
on
us
well
she
find
out
she
much
mistaken
and
when
she
gets
back
i
just
tell
her
plainly
that
she
can
bundle
up
her
company
and
send
them
home
and
come
out
to
us
now
or
or
the
offer
is
withdrawn
and
she
need
think
she
can
fall
back
on
herbert
either
when
she
spent
everything
herbert
is
not
a
man
to
be
put
upon
i
should
say
not
said
perkins
sympathetically
looking
over
her
friend
shoulder
at
the
telegram
so
those
were
your
two
children
he
must
been
pretty
well
off
for
them
to
have
a
car
like
that
i
must
say
i
think
it
a
harm
to
children
to
be
brought
up
wealthy
their
mother
was
rich
said
ellen
sourly
it
had
always
been
a
thorn
in
her
flesh
she
was
a
snob
too
and
her
children
likely
be
the
limit
by
this
time
but
julia
is
such
a
fool
they
sat
in
julia
cloud
parlor
one
at
each
window
discussing
the
probabilities
until
eleven
then
ellen
said
she
must
go
she
positively
could
wait
another
minute
but
she
would
return
in
the
afternoon
and
perkins
must
tell
her
sister
that
she
was
coming
and
wanted
her
to
remain
at
home
that
it
was
very
important
i
settle
her
she
said
with
her
thin
lips
set
in
a
hard
line
then
she
stooped
to
crank
her
ford
perkins
watched
her
away
then
hurried
to
her
own
neglected
work
and
ten
minutes
later
the
big
blue
car
sailed
noiselessly
up
to
the
place
it
was
not
until
the
perkins
children
discovered
it
and
told
their
mother
that
she
knew
it
had
arrived
this
was
very
annoying
she
had
wanted
to
catch
them
quite
casually
on
their
arrival
and
now
she
would
have
to
make
a
special
errand
over
and
as
likely
as
not
have
them
not
come
to
the
door
again
besides
she
was
getting
dinner
and
things
were
likely
to
burn
nevertheless
she
dared
not
wait
with
that
big
blue
car
standing
so
capably
at
the
door
ready
to
spirit
them
away
again
at
any
moment
she
wiped
her
hands
on
her
apron
grabbed
a
teacup
for
an
excuse
and
ran
over
to
borrow
that
soda
once
more
peals
of
laughter
were
echoing
through
the
old
house
when
she
knocked
at
the
door
and
a
regular
rush
and
scramble
was
going
on
so
unseemly
just
after
a
funeral
the
door
was
on
the
latch
too
as
if
they
did
not
care
who
heard
and
to
save
her
life
she
could
help
pushing
it
a
little
with
her
foot
just
enough
to
see
in
and
there
was
julia
cloud
her
white
hair
awry
and
her
face
rosy
with
mirth
an
ear
of
corn
in
one
hand
and
a
knife
in
the
other
being
carried
yes
actually
across
the
in
the
arms
of
a
tall
young
man
and
deposited
firmly
on
the
big
old
couch
there
cloudy
jewel
you
lie
right
there
and
rest
while
leslie
and
i
get
lunch
you
all
tired
out
i
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
and
we
ca
afford
to
let
you
stay
so
no
we
do
need
any
succotash
for
lunch
or
dinner
either
i
know
it
good
but
we
have
time
now
and
we
are
going
to
let
you
work
announced
the
young
man
joyously
as
he
towered
above
her
lying
quiescent
and
weak
with
laughter
no
nor
you
are
going
to
wash
the
dishes
either
gurgled
the
young
girl
who
danced
behind
the
young
man
allison
and
i
will
wash
them
all
while
you
take
a
nap
and
then
we
going
to
ride
again
julia
cloud
her
eyes
bright
with
the
joy
of
all
this
loving
playfulness
tried
to
protest
but
suddenly
into
the
midst
of
this
tumult
came
perkins
raucous
assertion
the
two
young
people
whirled
around
alertly
and
julia
cloud
sat
up
with
a
wild
attempt
to
bring
her
hair
into
subjection
as
she
recognized
her
neighbor
the
color
flooded
into
her
sweet
face
but
she
rose
with
gentle
dignity
o
perkins
we
must
have
been
making
such
a
noise
that
we
hear
your
knock
she
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
perkins
had
knocked
she
had
been
led
on
by
curiosity
until
she
stood
in
the
open
door
rank
disapproval
written
on
her
face
it
did
seem
a
good
bit
of
noise
for
a
house
of
mourning
said
perkins
dryly
julia
cloud
sweet
eyes
suddenly
lost
their
smile
and
she
drew
herself
up
ever
so
little
there
was
just
a
ripple
of
a
quiver
of
her
gentle
lips
and
she
said
quite
quietly
and
with
a
dignity
that
could
not
help
impressing
her
caller
this
is
not
a
house
of
mourning
perkins
i
do
think
my
dear
mother
would
want
us
to
mourn
because
she
was
released
from
a
bed
of
pain
where
she
had
lain
for
nine
long
years
and
gone
to
heaven
where
she
could
be
young
and
free
and
happy
i
glad
for
her
just
as
glad
as
i
can
be
and
i
know
she
would
want
me
to
be
but
wo
you
sit
down
perkins
this
is
my
niece
and
nephew
leslie
and
allison
cloud
from
california
i
guess
you
remember
them
when
they
were
little
children
or
no
you
had
moved
here
yet
when
they
were
here
perkins
with
pursed
lips
acknowledged
the
introduction
distantly
one
might
almost
say
insolently
and
turned
her
back
on
them
as
if
they
had
been
little
children
your
sister
been
here
all
morning
waiting
for
you
she
said
accusingly
she
gave
a
significant
glance
at
the
unwashed
breakfast
dishes
only
part
of
which
had
been
removed
to
the
kitchen
she
could
imagine
where
you
gone
at
that
hour
an
left
your
beds
and
your
dishes
a
wave
of
indignation
swept
over
julia
cloud
sweet
face
so
you
have
been
in
my
house
during
my
absence
she
said
quietly
that
seems
strange
since
ellen
has
no
key
there
was
nothing
in
her
voice
to
indicate
rebuke
but
perkins
got
very
red
i
your
own
sister
has
a
right
to
get
into
the
house
where
she
was
born
she
snapped
oh
of
course
said
julia
cloud
pleasantly
and
ellen
used
to
be
a
good
climber
before
she
got
so
fat
i
suppose
she
climbed
in
the
window
although
i
had
realized
she
could
however
it
does
matter
i
suppose
you
have
had
to
leave
your
dishes
and
beds
once
in
a
while
when
you
were
called
away
on
business
you
have
a
cup
there
did
you
want
to
borrow
something
perkins
was
one
of
those
people
who
are
never
quite
aware
of
it
when
they
are
in
a
corner
but
she
felt
most
uncomfortable
especially
as
she
caught
a
stifled
giggle
from
allison
who
bolted
into
the
parlor
hastily
and
began
noisily
to
turn
over
the
pages
of
a
book
on
the
table
but
she
managed
to
ask
for
her
soda
and
get
herself
out
of
the
house
thank
you
for
bringing
my
sister
message
called
julia
cloud
after
her
she
never
could
quite
bear
to
be
unpleasant
even
to
a
prying
neighbor
and
perkins
through
the
years
had
managed
to
make
herself
unpleasant
many
times
the
old
cat
said
leslie
in
a
clear
carrying
voice
why
did
you
thank
her
auntie
jewel
she
did
deserve
it
hush
leslie
dear
she
will
hear
you
said
julia
cloud
hastily
closing
the
door
on
the
last
words
i
hope
she
did
said
leslie
comfortably
i
she
should
but
deary
that
is
right
it
is
christian
said
her
aunt
in
distress
then
i
no
christian
chanted
leslie
mischievously
why
is
it
right
i
like
to
know
is
she
an
old
cat
but
you
hurt
her
feelings
dear
i
afraid
i
was
to
blame
too
i
did
answer
her
any
too
sweetly
myself
well
did
she
hurt
yours
first
why
you
were
honey
itself
cloudy
dear
thanking
her
for
her
old
prying
i
hope
it
the
kind
of
honey
that
gets
bitter
after
you
swallow
it
growled
allison
coming
out
of
the
parlor
if
she
said
much
more
i
just
have
put
her
out
of
the
house
talking
to
you
like
that
as
if
you
were
a
little
child
cloudy
why
children
that
did
really
hurt
me
any
it
just
stirred
up
my
temper
a
little
but
i
ashamed
that
i
let
it
and
i
do
want
you
to
talk
like
that
it
is
a
bit
right
it
distresses
me
to
have
you
think
it
right
to
answer
back
that
way
and
take
vengeance
on
people
well
there
cloudy
let
lay
that
subject
on
the
table
for
some
of
our
night
talks
and
you
can
scold
us
all
you
like
we
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
now
and
let
forget
the
old
pry
now
you
lie
down
on
that
couch
where
i
put
you
and
leslie
and
i
wash
these
dishes
julia
cloud
lay
obediently
on
the
couch
but
her
mind
was
not
at
rest
she
was
in
a
tumult
of
indignation
at
her
prying
neighbor
and
an
uncertainty
of
anxiety
about
ellen
and
what
she
might
do
next
but
beneath
it
all
was
a
vague
fear
about
these
her
dear
children
who
were
about
to
become
her
responsibility
could
she
do
it
dared
she
do
it
how
differently
they
had
been
brought
up
from
all
the
traditions
which
had
controlled
her
life
take
for
instance
that
matter
of
christianity
how
would
they
feel
about
it
would
they
be
in
sympathy
with
her
ideas
and
ideals
of
right
and
wrong
they
were
no
longer
little
children
to
obey
her
they
would
have
ideas
of
their
own
yes
and
ideals
would
there
be
constant
clashing
would
she
be
haunted
with
a
feeling
that
she
was
not
doing
her
duty
by
them
there
were
so
many
such
questions
amusements
and
sabbath
and
churchgoing
and
how
to
treat
other
people
and
doubtless
she
was
and
they
would
chafe
under
her
rule
take
the
little
matter
of
leslie
calling
perkins
a
cat
she
a
cat
but
leslie
ought
not
to
have
told
her
so
it
polite
and
it
was
christian
and
yet
how
could
she
plain
julia
cloud
who
had
never
been
anywhere
much
outside
of
her
home
town
who
had
had
no
opportunity
for
study
or
wide
reading
and
who
had
only
worked
quietly
all
her
life
and
thought
her
plain
little
thoughts
of
love
to
god
and
to
her
neighbors
be
able
to
explain
all
those
things
to
this
pair
of
lovable
uncontrolled
children
who
had
always
had
their
own
way
and
whose
ideals
were
the
ideals
of
the
great
wide
unchristian
world
a
little
pucker
grew
between
her
brows
and
a
tired
troubled
tear
stole
softly
between
her
lashes
when
the
children
tiptoeing
about
and
whispering
came
to
peek
in
at
the
door
and
see
whether
she
was
asleep
they
discovered
her
expression
at
once
and
drawing
near
sighted
the
tear
then
they
went
down
upon
their
knees
beside
her
couch
and
noisily
demanded
the
cause
thereof
little
by
little
they
drew
her
fears
from
her
why
cloudy
dear
we
do
what
you
want
we
let
all
the
old
cats
in
the
community
walk
over
you
if
that
will
make
you
happy
declared
leslie
patting
her
face
no
we
wo
put
in
allison
we
keep
away
from
her
but
we
wo
let
know
how
we
despise
wo
that
do
cloudy
and
as
for
all
those
other
things
you
are
afraid
about
why
could
you
just
wait
till
we
come
to
them
we
anything
but
angels
i
admit
but
we
going
to
try
to
do
what
you
want
us
to
if
it
busts
the
out
of
us
because
we
want
you
and
you
always
have
been
such
a
good
scout
as
for
the
church
dope
and
all
that
why
it
like
that
guy
in
the
bible
you
used
to
tell
us
about
when
we
were
children
or
was
she
a
lady
it
a
case
of
people
shall
be
my
people
and
thy
god
my
god
or
words
to
that
effect
if
we
do
agree
on
our
own
account
we
do
it
because
you
want
it
is
that
about
the
idea
that
fill
the
bill
you
dear
children
said
julia
cloud
her
eyes
full
of
smiles
and
tears
now
as
she
gathered
them
both
into
a
loving
embrace
i
know
how
anybody
could
promise
more
than
that
i
was
afraid
of
you
it
was
myself
you
know
i
not
at
all
wise
and
it
pretty
late
in
life
for
me
to
begin
to
bring
up
children
well
you
all
right
anyhow
cloudy
and
you
the
only
person
in
the
world
we
let
bring
us
up
so
it
up
to
you
to
do
it
the
best
you
can
or
it
wo
get
done
come
on
now
we
got
lunch
ready
there
cold
chicken
and
bread
and
milk
and
pie
and
cake
and
got
the
teakettle
boiling
like
a
house
afire
so
if
you
want
any
tea
or
anything
you
can
have
it
so
they
had
a
merry
meal
and
julia
cloud
ate
and
laughed
with
them
and
thought
she
never
had
been
so
happy
since
she
was
a
little
girl
then
mindful
of
her
prying
neighbor
and
her
imminent
sister
she
insisted
on
putting
the
house
in
order
to
the
last
bed
and
dish
before
she
was
ready
for
the
afternoon
and
now
we
going
to
call
on
aunt
ellen
announced
allison
as
julia
cloud
hung
up
the
clean
steaming
from
their
scalding
bath
and
washed
her
hands
at
the
sink
why
she
coming
here
said
his
aunt
whirling
around
with
a
troubled
look
and
as
she
left
word
she
was
coming
i
suppose
we
have
to
wait
for
her
it
too
bad
for
she
wo
be
here
till
three
and
it
only
a
quarter
of
two
i
sorry
because
you
wanted
to
go
out
in
the
car
did
you
we
going
said
allison
again
with
a
commanding
twinkle
in
his
eye
we
ca
waste
all
that
time
and
besides
do
you
see
if
she
comes
here
she
likely
stay
all
the
afternoon
and
argue
if
we
go
there
we
can
come
away
when
we
like
and
she
feel
we
more
polite
to
come
to
her
anyhow
wo
she
cloudy
julia
cloud
looked
into
the
boy
convincing
eyes
and
her
trouble
cleared
away
perhaps
he
was
right
anyhow
why
should
they
spoil
a
whole
day
to
conciliate
ellen
ellen
would
be
disagreeable
about
it
however
they
did
and
they
might
as
well
rise
above
it
and
just
be
pleasant
and
let
it
go
at
that
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
long
life
of
that
julia
cloud
had
been
able
to
rise
above
her
anxiety
about
her
tantrums
and
go
calmly
on
her
way
it
is
scarcely
likely
that
she
would
have
managed
it
now
if
it
had
been
that
she
felt
that
allison
and
leslie
ought
not
to
be
sacrificed
she
never
did
anything
just
for
herself
it
was
not
in
her
all
right
she
said
briskly
glancing
at
the
clock
then
we
must
go
at
once
or
we
shall
miss
her
i
be
ready
in
five
minutes
how
about
you
leslie
oh
i
ready
now
said
the
girl
patting
her
curly
hair
into
shape
before
the
old
mirror
in
the
hall
in
five
minutes
more
they
were
stowed
away
in
the
big
blue
car
again
speeding
down
the
road
with
perkins
indignantly
and
openly
watching
them
from
her
front
porch
we
put
one
over
on
pry
did
we
cloudy
said
allison
turning
around
to
wink
a
naughty
eye
back
toward
the
perkins
house
she
thinks
you
dared
to
run
away
after
she
gave
you
orders
to
stay
at
home
julia
cloud
could
not
suppress
a
smile
of
enjoyment
and
wondered
whether
she
was
getting
childish
that
she
should
be
so
happy
with
these
children
chapter
v
the
air
was
fine
the
sky
was
clear
without
a
cloud
and
the
spice
of
autumn
flavored
everything
along
the
roadside
blackberry
vines
were
turning
scarlet
and
here
and
there
in
the
distance
a
flaming
branch
proclaimed
the
approach
of
a
frosty
wooing
one
could
not
ask
anything
better
on
such
a
day
than
to
be
speeding
along
this
white
velvet
road
in
the
great
blue
car
with
two
beloved
children
but
all
too
soon
herbert
robinson
ornate
house
loomed
up
stark
and
green
with
very
white
trimmings
and
regular
each
side
of
the
gravel
walk
it
was
the
home
of
a
prosperous
man
and
as
such
asserted
itself
there
had
never
been
anything
attractive
about
it
to
julia
cloud
she
preferred
the
ugly
old
house
in
which
she
had
always
lived
with
its
scaling
gray
paint
and
no
pretensions
to
fineness
at
least
it
was
softened
by
age
and
had
a
look
of
experience
which
saved
its
ugliness
from
being
crude
and
gave
it
the
dignity
of
time
and
now
julia
cloud
heart
began
to
beat
rapidly
all
at
once
she
felt
that
she
had
done
a
most
foolish
thing
in
allowing
the
children
to
overrule
her
and
bring
her
here
ellen
would
not
be
dressed
up
nor
have
the
children
ready
for
inspection
and
she
would
be
angry
at
her
sister
for
not
having
given
warning
of
their
coming
she
leaned
forward
breathlessly
to
suggest
turning
back
but
allison
perhaps
anticipating
her
feeling
said
now
do
you
get
cold
feet
cloudy
jewel
if
aunt
ellen
is
sore
just
you
talk
up
to
her
and
smile
a
lot
and
we
back
you
up
remember
everything
going
fine
and
the
whole
thing
settled
too
late
to
change
it
now
is
this
the
place
we
turn
right
in
shall
we
and
with
the
words
he
swept
up
under
the
elaborate
wooden
and
swinging
down
flung
the
door
open
for
julia
cloud
to
alight
leslie
gave
a
quick
disdainful
glance
about
fluttered
out
beside
her
aunt
and
catching
the
look
of
apprehension
on
her
face
tripped
up
the
steps
and
rang
the
bell
poising
on
the
threshold
and
calling
in
a
sweet
voice
aunt
ellen
o
aunt
ellen
where
are
you
do
you
know
you
got
company
all
the
way
from
california
it
was
just
like
taking
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
julia
cloud
paused
on
the
upper
step
in
wonder
how
winning
a
child
she
was
and
how
she
had
known
by
intuition
just
how
to
mollify
her
unpleasant
relative
what
would
ellen
say
how
would
she
take
it
ellen
robinson
bustled
frowning
into
the
hall
whetting
her
sharp
tongue
for
an
encounter
she
had
seen
the
big
blue
car
turn
in
at
the
gate
and
knew
from
perkins
description
who
it
must
be
julia
cloud
had
well
judged
her
state
of
mind
for
her
four
children
could
not
have
been
caught
in
a
worse
plight
so
far
as
untidiness
was
concerned
and
there
had
barely
been
time
to
marshal
them
all
up
the
back
stairs
with
orders
to
scrub
and
dress
or
not
to
come
down
till
the
visitors
were
gone
they
were
even
now
creeping
shufflingly
about
overhead
on
their
bare
feet
hunting
for
their
respective
best
shoes
and
stockings
and
other
garments
and
scrapping
in
loud
whispers
but
leslie
little
diplomat
that
she
was
wasted
no
time
in
taking
stock
of
her
aunt
she
flung
her
arms
joyously
around
that
astonished
woman
and
fairly
took
her
by
storm
talking
volubly
and
continuously
until
they
were
all
in
the
house
and
seated
in
ellen
best
satin
brocatelle
parlor
chairs
surrounded
by
crayon
portraits
of
herbert
robinson
ancestors
and
descendants
allison
too
caught
on
to
his
sister
game
and
talked
a
good
deal
about
how
nice
it
was
to
get
east
again
after
all
the
years
and
how
glad
they
were
to
have
some
relatives
of
their
own
julia
cloud
sat
quietly
and
proudly
listening
and
ellen
forgot
her
anger
and
ceased
to
frown
after
all
it
was
something
to
have
such
relatives
for
the
first
few
minutes
the
speech
wherewith
she
had
intended
to
dress
down
poor
julia
lay
idle
on
her
lips
and
a
few
sentences
of
grudging
welcome
even
managed
to
slip
by
then
suddenly
she
turned
to
her
sister
and
the
sight
of
the
adoration
for
the
visitors
in
transparent
face
kindled
her
anger
never
had
such
a
look
as
this
glowed
in
julia
cloud
face
for
any
little
robinson
save
perhaps
in
the
first
few
days
of
their
tiny
lives
before
the
robinson
had
begun
to
crop
out
in
them
where
were
you
this
morning
jule
it
certainly
seems
queer
for
you
to
be
gadding
around
having
a
good
time
so
soon
after
poor
death
and
the
dishes
not
washed
either
upon
my
word
you
have
lost
your
head
you
were
brought
up
that
way
i
stood
and
looked
around
on
those
unmade
beds
and
thought
what
poor
mother
would
have
said
if
she
could
see
them
such
i
certainly
was
ashamed
to
have
perkins
see
it
two
rosy
spots
bloomed
out
on
julia
cloud
cheeks
and
a
tremble
came
in
her
lips
though
one
could
see
she
was
making
a
great
effort
to
control
herself
and
the
two
long
breaths
that
leslie
and
allison
drew
simultaneously
were
heavily
threatening
much
like
the
distant
rumble
of
thunder
i
sure
i
do
see
what
occasion
perkins
had
to
see
it
she
answered
steadily
well
she
was
there
said
her
sister
dryly
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
presence
of
the
two
young
people
who
if
they
had
been
in
the
foreground
might
have
been
noticed
doing
things
with
their
eyebrows
to
their
mutual
understanding
and
agreement
yes
so
she
told
me
said
julia
cloud
significantly
but
that
was
not
what
i
came
over
to
talk
about
ellen
i
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
i
rented
the
house
and
the
tenant
wants
possession
next
week
i
thought
you
might
like
to
pick
out
some
of
mother
things
to
bring
over
here
before
i
pack
up
you
spoke
about
wishing
you
had
another
couch
for
the
and
you
might
just
as
well
have
the
one
as
not
then
i
thought
perhaps
you
could
use
bedroom
suit
you
rented
the
house
screamed
ellen
as
soon
as
she
got
breath
from
her
astonishment
to
interrupt
you
rented
the
house
without
consulting
me
who
to
i
like
to
know
i
had
a
tenant
already
for
that
house
i
told
you
why
i
had
no
time
to
consult
you
ellen
and
besides
why
should
i
the
house
is
mine
and
i
knew
you
did
want
it
you
have
your
own
home
well
you
certainly
are
blossoming
out
and
getting
independent
i
should
think
mere
decency
would
have
made
you
consult
us
before
you
did
anything
what
do
you
know
about
business
herbert
will
be
mad
as
anything
when
i
tell
him
and
like
as
not
you
get
into
no
end
of
trouble
with
a
strange
tenant
and
we
have
to
help
you
out
herbert
always
says
women
make
all
the
trouble
they
can
for
him
before
they
call
on
him
for
assistance
julia
smiled
i
shall
not
be
obliged
to
call
on
herbert
for
assistance
ellen
everything
is
arranged
the
contract
was
signed
this
morning
and
i
have
promised
to
vacate
as
soon
as
possible
the
tenant
is
the
new
school
superintendent
and
he
wants
to
come
at
once
i
just
heard
last
evening
that
he
had
been
disappointed
in
getting
the
harvey
house
it
sold
to
the
foreman
of
the
mill
so
i
went
over
to
harmony
to
see
him
at
once
the
news
was
so
overwhelming
and
so
unquestionably
satisfactory
from
a
business
point
of
view
that
ellen
was
speechless
with
astonishment
allison
gave
leslie
a
grave
wink
and
turned
to
look
out
of
the
window
to
prevent
an
outburst
of
giggles
from
his
sister
well
i
think
you
might
have
let
me
know
ellen
resumed
with
almost
her
usual
poise
it
rather
mortifying
not
to
know
what
going
on
in
your
own
family
when
the
neighbors
ask
here
was
i
without
any
knowledge
of
the
arrival
of
my
own
niece
and
nephew
had
to
be
told
by
mrs
perkins
then
allison
and
leslie
did
laugh
but
they
veiled
their
mirth
by
talking
about
the
two
white
chickens
out
in
the
yard
which
were
contending
for
a
worm
suddenly
leslie
exclaimed
o
allison
i
hear
the
children
coming
and
i
forgot
their
presents
run
out
to
the
car
and
bring
me
that
box
allison
was
off
at
once
and
the
entrance
of
the
soapy
and
embarrassed
children
created
a
further
diversion
for
a
few
minutes
even
ellen
robinson
was
absorbed
in
the
presents
there
was
a
camera
for
junior
a
gold
chain
and
locket
for
elaine
a
beautiful
doll
for
dorothy
and
a
small
train
of
cars
that
would
wind
up
and
run
on
a
miniature
track
for
bertie
so
of
course
everything
had
to
be
looked
at
and
tried
elaine
put
on
her
chain
and
preened
herself
before
the
glass
junior
had
to
understand
at
once
just
how
to
take
a
picture
everybody
had
to
watch
the
doll
open
and
shut
its
eyes
and
to
try
to
unbutton
and
button
its
coat
and
dress
and
then
the
railroad
track
had
to
be
set
up
and
the
train
started
off
on
its
rounds
ellen
robinson
really
looked
almost
motherly
while
she
watched
her
happy
children
and
julia
cloud
relaxed
and
let
the
smile
come
around
her
lips
once
more
but
all
things
come
to
an
end
and
ellen
robinson
was
not
one
to
forget
her
own
affairs
for
long
at
a
time
she
sat
back
from
starting
the
engine
on
its
third
round
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
her
sister
with
that
air
of
that
was
so
intolerable
well
then
i
suppose
you
wo
be
over
here
till
next
week
she
frowned
thoughtfully
i
needed
you
to
help
with
the
crabapple
jelly
that
makes
it
inconvenient
but
perhaps
i
can
hold
off
the
fruit
a
little
longer
i
see
you
ought
to
be
able
to
get
all
your
packing
done
this
week
i
should
think
when
do
they
go
she
nodded
toward
the
niece
and
nephew
quite
indifferently
as
though
they
were
deaf
julia
cloud
sensitive
face
flushed
with
annoyance
but
the
two
pairs
of
bright
eyes
that
lifted
and
fixed
themselves
upon
their
aunt
held
nothing
but
enjoyment
of
the
situation
why
we
not
going
until
aunt
jewel
is
ready
to
go
with
us
aunt
ellen
announced
leslie
looking
up
from
the
doll
she
was
reclothing
you
know
we
all
going
to
college
together
auntie
too
ellen
robinson
lifted
an
indignant
chin
she
had
no
sense
of
humor
and
did
not
enjoy
jokes
especially
those
practised
upon
herself
going
to
college
at
her
age
she
snorted
well
i
always
knew
she
was
childish
but
i
never
expected
her
to
want
to
go
back
to
kindergarten
leslie
rose
up
straight
as
a
rush
her
strong
young
arms
down
at
her
sides
her
fingers
in
their
soft
suède
gloves
working
restively
as
if
she
wanted
to
rush
at
her
aunt
and
administer
corporal
punishment
her
pretty
red
lips
were
pursed
angrily
and
her
blue
eyes
fairly
blazed
righteous
wrath
julia
cloud
caught
her
breath
and
wondered
how
she
was
to
control
this
young
fury
but
before
she
could
say
a
word
allison
stepped
in
front
of
her
and
spoke
coolly
that
the
reason
she
such
a
good
scout
aunt
ellen
that
why
we
want
her
to
come
and
take
care
of
us
because
she
knows
how
to
stay
young
he
suddenly
seemed
to
have
grown
very
tall
and
quite
mature
as
he
spoke
and
there
was
something
about
his
manly
bearing
that
held
ellen
robinson
tongue
in
check
as
he
looked
at
his
watch
with
a
polite
excuse
me
and
then
turned
to
julia
cloud
aunt
jewel
if
we
are
to
meet
my
guardian
on
that
train
i
think
we
shall
have
to
hurry
quite
a
run
into
the
city
you
know
julia
cloud
arose
with
a
breath
of
relief
the
city
gasped
ellen
you
not
going
into
the
city
this
late
in
the
afternoon
i
hope
do
you
know
how
long
it
takes
allison
glanced
out
to
his
machine
confidently
we
made
it
in
an
hour
and
a
half
coming
over
i
guess
we
shall
have
plenty
of
time
to
meet
the
train
if
we
go
at
once
got
a
peach
of
a
car
aunt
ellen
i
have
to
come
round
and
take
you
and
the
kids
a
ride
or
the
next
day
if
aunt
jewel
can
spare
me
thank
you
i
have
a
car
of
my
own
snapped
his
aunt
disagreeably
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
well
aunt
jewel
we
really
must
go
if
we
are
to
meet
luddington
aunt
ellen
cousins
see
you
again
before
we
leave
town
of
course
come
on
aunt
jewel
and
he
took
julia
cloud
lightly
protectingly
by
the
elbow
and
steered
her
out
of
the
room
down
the
steps
and
into
the
car
while
leslie
danced
gayly
after
chattering
away
about
how
nice
it
was
to
get
back
east
and
meet
real
relatives
but
ellen
robinson
was
not
listening
to
leslie
she
hurried
after
her
departing
guests
regardless
of
a
noisy
struggle
that
was
going
on
between
her
two
youngest
over
the
railway
train
and
stood
on
her
front
steps
fairly
snorting
with
indignation
julia
cloud
what
does
all
this
mean
you
sha
go
away
until
you
explain
have
you
taken
leave
of
your
senses
what
is
this
nonsense
about
going
to
college
allison
with
his
hand
on
the
starter
gave
his
aunt
a
swift
reassuring
smile
and
julia
cloud
from
the
safe
vantage
of
the
back
seat
leaned
forward
smiling
why
it
the
children
that
are
going
to
college
ellen
not
only
going
along
to
keep
house
and
play
mother
for
them
is
it
lovely
i
tell
you
all
about
it
when
you
come
down
to
pick
out
your
things
be
sure
to
come
early
because
i
want
to
get
started
packing
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
luddington
the
children
guardian
is
coming
to
complete
the
arrangements
and
we
expect
to
get
away
just
as
soon
as
i
can
get
packed
up
so
come
early
the
engine
purred
softly
for
a
rhythmical
second
and
the
car
slid
quickly
away
from
the
door
but
the
very
idea
snorted
aunt
ellen
julia
cloud
she
fairly
shouted
stop
you
had
no
right
in
the
world
to
go
ahead
and
make
plans
without
consulting
me
but
the
car
was
beyond
now
and
leslie
was
waving
a
pretty
tantalizing
hand
from
the
back
seat
the
very
idea
ellen
robinson
gasped
to
the
autumn
landscape
as
she
stood
alone
and
watched
the
car
a
mere
speck
down
the
road
on
its
way
to
town
the
idea
and
then
as
if
for
poor
mother
what
would
she
think
if
she
could
know
well
i
wash
my
hands
of
her
but
ellen
robinson
did
not
wash
her
hands
of
her
sister
instead
she
found
that
it
was
going
to
be
very
hard
indeed
to
wash
her
hands
of
her
own
affairs
without
her
sister
help
she
had
in
fact
been
counting
on
that
help
for
the
last
several
years
after
her
mother
became
an
invalid
and
she
knew
that
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
before
julia
hands
would
be
set
free
for
other
labor
it
was
quite
too
disconcerting
now
after
having
got
along
all
these
years
on
the
strength
of
the
help
that
was
to
come
to
find
her
capable
sister
snatched
away
from
her
by
two
young
things
in
this
ridiculous
way
they
talked
it
over
at
supper
and
herbert
was
almost
savage
about
it
as
if
in
some
way
his
wife
had
misrepresented
the
possibilities
and
led
him
to
expect
the
assistance
that
would
come
from
her
sister
and
save
him
from
paying
wages
to
a
servant
well
she
be
good
and
sick
of
it
inside
of
three
months
mark
my
words
and
then
she
come
whining
back
and
want
us
to
take
her
in
be
glad
enough
to
get
a
home
so
do
you
worry
but
what
i
want
understood
is
this
not
going
to
find
it
so
easy
to
get
see
you
make
her
thoroughly
understand
that
you
better
go
down
and
pick
out
everything
you
want
take
plenty
you
ca
tell
but
something
may
happen
to
the
house
and
the
furniture
burn
up
we
might
as
well
have
it
as
anybody
and
you
make
it
good
and
sure
that
she
understands
right
here
and
now
that
if
she
goes
she
does
come
back
of
course
i
not
saying
she
ca
come
back
if
she
comes
to
her
senses
and
is
real
humble
but
you
need
let
her
know
that
just
give
her
to
understand
it
is
her
last
chance
that
i
ca
be
monkeyed
with
this
way
i
offered
her
a
very
generous
thing
and
she
knows
it
and
she
a
fool
that
what
she
is
a
i
say
he
brought
his
big
fist
down
heavily
on
the
table
and
jarred
the
dishes
and
the
children
looked
up
in
premature
comprehension
storing
up
the
epithet
for
future
use
she
no
end
of
a
fool
going
off
with
those
crazy
kids
some
one
ought
to
warn
their
guardian
about
her
why
she
has
no
more
idea
of
how
to
take
care
of
two
high
and
mighty
like
that
than
an
infant
in
arms
meantime
the
subject
of
their
discussion
was
seated
serenely
at
a
table
in
one
of
the
best
hotels
of
the
great
city
having
the
time
of
her
life
in
the
years
that
were
to
come
there
might
be
many
more
delightful
suppers
even
more
elegantly
served
perhaps
but
none
would
ever
rival
this
first
time
in
her
existence
when
she
had
sat
among
the
wealthy
and
great
of
the
land
and
been
treated
like
one
of
them
luddington
was
a
typical
business
man
elderly
and
kind
with
wise
eyes
and
a
great
smile
he
turned
his
eyes
keenly
on
julia
cloud
for
an
instant
at
their
first
meeting
then
let
his
full
smile
envelop
her
and
she
was
somehow
made
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
had
set
his
seal
of
approval
to
the
contract
already
made
by
his
two
enthusiastic
wards
all
the
forebodings
she
had
entertained
in
the
little
intervals
when
leslie
and
allison
allowed
her
to
think
at
all
were
swept
aside
by
his
kind
look
and
big
serious
tone
when
he
first
took
her
hand
and
scanned
her
true
face
i
glad
they
picked
such
a
woman
he
said
you
have
your
hands
full
for
they
a
pair
but
it
worth
it
and
when
they
all
rode
home
through
the
moonlight
julia
cloud
nestled
under
the
soft
thick
robes
of
the
car
and
listened
to
the
pleasant
talk
between
the
young
people
and
their
guardian
with
a
sense
of
peace
if
this
strong
wise
business
man
thought
the
arrangement
was
all
right
why
then
she
need
not
fear
any
longer
it
was
real
and
not
a
dream
and
she
might
rely
upon
the
wisdom
of
her
decision
and
with
that
sense
of
being
upheld
by
something
wiser
than
her
own
wish
she
fell
asleep
that
night
haunted
by
no
dreams
of
her
domineering
sister
chapter
vi
the
pleasant
aromas
of
coffee
and
sausages
were
mingling
in
the
air
when
guardy
lud
woke
up
and
looked
about
the
room
with
a
sense
of
satisfaction
the
very
pictures
on
the
walls
rested
him
they
reminded
him
so
much
of
the
rooms
in
his
boyhood
home
he
had
a
feeling
that
things
were
best
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
owned
a
house
most
different
from
this
one
himself
and
knew
that
his
wife
would
not
for
a
minute
have
tolerated
any
things
about
unless
they
were
so
that
they
had
become
the
latest
rage
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
a
woman
brought
up
amid
such
simple
surroundings
would
be
the
very
best
kind
to
mother
these
orphan
children
who
had
been
left
on
his
helpless
hands
he
would
have
loved
to
take
them
to
his
heart
and
his
home
but
his
wife
was
not
so
minded
and
that
ended
it
but
it
rolled
a
great
burden
from
his
shoulders
to
feel
that
he
might
leave
them
in
such
capable
hands
they
had
a
rollicking
time
at
breakfast
for
guardy
lud
was
delighted
with
the
crisp
brown
sausages
fried
potatoes
and
buckwheats
with
real
and
he
laughed
and
ate
and
told
stories
with
the
children
and
kept
the
old
walls
ringing
with
joy
as
they
had
not
resounded
within
the
memory
of
julia
cloud
then
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
there
stood
ellen
robinson
disapproval
and
hauteur
written
in
every
line
of
her
unpleasant
face
one
could
hardly
imagine
how
those
two
julia
and
ellen
could
possibly
be
sisters
dismay
filled
julia
cloud
heart
for
an
instant
and
brought
a
pallor
to
her
cheek
how
had
she
forgotten
ellen
what
a
fool
she
had
been
to
tell
ellen
to
come
early
in
the
morning
but
she
had
not
realized
that
luddington
would
be
willing
to
come
out
to
her
humble
home
and
stay
all
night
she
had
supposed
that
the
arrangements
would
be
made
in
the
city
however
it
could
not
be
helped
now
and
a
glance
at
the
kind
strong
face
of
the
man
gave
her
courage
ellen
could
not
really
spoil
their
plans
with
him
there
he
felt
that
the
arrangement
was
good
and
with
him
to
back
her
she
felt
she
could
stand
out
against
any
arguments
her
sister
might
bring
forth
so
she
rose
with
a
natural
ease
and
introduced
her
my
sister
robinson
luddington
and
ellen
stiffly
and
still
disapprovingly
acknowledged
the
introduction
i
wo
interrupt
she
said
disagreeably
i
just
going
up
to
look
over
some
of
my
mother
things
and
she
turned
to
the
back
stairway
and
went
up
closing
the
door
behind
her
luddington
gazed
after
her
a
second
and
then
taking
his
glasses
off
and
wiping
them
energetically
he
remarked
well
well
bless
my
soul
it
must
be
getting
late
we
had
such
a
good
time
i
did
realize
those
certainly
were
good
buckwheats
miss
cloud
i
sha
forget
them
very
soon
and
now
i
suppose
we
better
get
down
to
business
could
we
just
go
into
the
other
room
there
and
close
the
door
for
a
few
minutes
not
to
be
interrupted
and
he
cast
an
anxious
glance
toward
the
again
julia
cloud
smiled
understandingly
and
ushered
them
into
the
little
parlor
ablaze
with
fall
sunshine
its
windows
wreathed
about
with
crimsoning
woodbine
and
as
she
caught
the
glow
and
glint
from
the
window
she
remembered
the
gray
evening
when
she
had
looked
out
across
into
her
future
as
she
supposed
it
would
be
how
beautiful
and
wonderful
that
the
gray
had
changed
to
glow
as
she
sat
down
to
enter
into
the
contract
that
was
to
bind
her
to
a
new
and
wonderful
life
with
great
responsibilities
and
large
possibilities
her
heart
accustomed
to
look
upward
sent
a
whisper
of
thanksgiving
heavenward
the
details
did
not
take
long
after
all
for
luddington
was
a
keen
business
man
and
he
had
gone
over
the
whole
proposition
and
had
the
plan
in
writing
for
her
to
sign
telling
just
what
were
her
duties
and
responsibilities
with
regard
to
his
wards
just
how
much
money
she
would
have
for
housekeeping
and
servants
and
other
expenses
and
the
salary
she
would
receive
herself
for
accepting
this
care
you
practically
in
a
position
of
mother
to
them
you
know
he
said
beaming
at
her
genially
and
i
declare
i
never
laid
eyes
on
a
woman
that
i
thought
could
fill
the
part
better
julia
cloud
was
quite
overwhelmed
but
the
matter
of
the
salary
troubled
her
i
think
it
should
not
be
a
matter
of
money
she
demurred
i
would
rather
do
it
for
love
you
know
love
all
right
said
the
old
man
smiling
but
this
thing
has
got
to
be
on
a
business
basis
or
the
terms
of
the
will
will
not
allow
me
to
agree
to
it
you
see
what
you
are
going
to
undertake
means
work
and
it
means
sticking
to
it
and
you
deserve
pay
for
it
and
we
not
going
to
accept
several
of
the
best
years
out
of
your
life
for
nothing
besides
you
got
to
feel
free
to
give
up
the
job
if
it
proves
too
burdensome
for
you
and
you
to
dismiss
me
if
i
do
not
prove
capable
for
the
position
suggested
julia
cloud
lifting
meek
and
honest
eyes
to
meet
his
gaze
well
well
well
i
can
see
there
wo
be
any
need
of
that
sputtered
the
old
gentleman
pleasantly
but
however
that
is
this
is
the
contract
i
made
out
and
i
quite
satisfied
so
are
the
children
are
you
willing
to
sign
it
of
course
there
a
clause
in
there
about
reasonable
notice
if
there
is
dissatisfaction
on
either
side
that
lets
you
out
at
any
time
you
get
tired
of
it
only
give
me
a
chance
to
look
after
these
youngsters
properly
julia
cloud
took
the
pen
eagerly
tremblingly
a
sense
of
wonder
in
her
pounding
heart
and
signed
her
name
just
as
ellen
heavy
footsteps
could
be
heard
pounding
down
the
back
stairs
leslie
seized
julia
and
gave
her
a
great
hug
as
the
last
letter
was
finished
and
then
threw
open
the
parlor
door
in
the
nick
of
time
to
save
her
aunt
ellen
from
seeming
to
be
deserted
ellen
robinson
appeared
on
the
scene
just
in
time
to
witness
the
hearty
that
guardy
lud
gave
julia
cloud
as
he
picked
up
the
papers
and
went
for
his
suitcase
while
allison
went
after
the
car
to
take
him
to
the
train
is
that
man
married
because
if
he
is
i
do
think
respectable
for
you
to
go
and
live
near
him
declared
ellen
in
a
penetrating
voice
to
the
intense
distress
of
julia
cloud
who
was
happily
hurrying
the
dishes
from
the
breakfast
table
but
leslie
came
to
the
rescue
oh
indeed
aunt
ellen
he
very
much
married
altogether
too
much
married
for
comfort
he
would
be
a
dear
if
it
was
for
his
silly
little
old
bossy
wife
but
he
does
intend
to
live
anywhere
near
us
his
home
is
off
in
california
and
he
going
back
next
week
only
waiting
to
see
us
settled
somewhere
before
he
goes
back
so
you
need
worry
about
aunt
jewel
morals
we
take
good
care
of
her
but
is
he
a
dear
he
was
my
grandfather
leslie
best
friend
leslie
chattered
on
gayly
till
the
visitor
footsteps
could
be
heard
coming
again
and
ellen
robinson
could
only
shut
her
lips
tight
and
go
into
the
kitchen
from
which
her
sister
beat
immediately
a
hasty
retreat
lest
more
unpleasant
remarks
should
be
forthcoming
julia
cloud
bade
luddington
standing
on
her
own
front
steps
and
then
waited
a
moment
looking
off
toward
the
hills
which
had
shut
in
her
vision
all
her
life
the
two
young
people
had
rushed
down
to
the
car
and
were
pulling
their
guardian
joyously
inside
they
seemed
to
do
everything
joyously
like
two
young
creatures
let
out
of
prison
into
the
sunshine
julia
cloud
smiled
at
the
thought
of
them
but
her
soul
was
not
watching
them
just
then
she
was
looking
off
to
the
hills
that
had
been
her
strength
all
the
years
through
so
many
trials
and
gathering
strength
now
to
go
in
and
meet
her
sister
in
final
combat
she
knew
that
there
would
be
a
scene
that
was
inevitable
that
she
might
maintain
her
calmness
and
say
nothing
unkind
or
regrettable
she
was
praying
earnestly
now
as
her
eyes
sought
the
hills
across
the
road
behind
her
parlor
curtains
perkins
was
keeping
lookout
and
remarking
to
a
neighbor
who
had
run
in
yes
i
thought
as
much
there
always
a
man
in
the
case
when
a
woman
acts
queer
now
does
that
beat
all
do
you
suppose
he
a
lover
or
something
come
back
now
he
knows
she
free
seems
to
me
i
did
hear
there
was
somebody
died
or
something
before
we
came
here
to
live
but
she
must
have
been
awful
young
the
car
moved
noisily
away
and
the
old
gentleman
leaned
out
with
a
courteous
lift
of
his
hat
toward
julia
cloud
she
acknowledged
it
with
a
bow
and
a
smile
which
perkins
pounced
on
and
analyzed
audibly
well
there
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
as
the
saying
is
just
watch
her
smirk
i
mighty
glad
ellen
robinson
there
to
relieve
me
of
the
responsibility
she
be
over
after
a
while
and
then
we
know
who
he
is
there
goes
julia
in
she
watched
him
out
o
sight
well
i
wonder
what
her
mother
would
think
julia
cloud
went
slowly
back
to
the
where
ellen
was
seated
on
the
couch
waiting
like
a
visitor
julia
smile
was
utterly
lost
on
her
glum
countenance
which
resembled
an
embattled
tower
under
siege
well
she
said
as
julia
began
to
gather
up
more
dishes
from
the
breakfast
table
i
suppose
you
think
you
done
something
smart
now
do
you
getting
that
old
snob
here
and
fixing
things
all
up
without
consulting
any
of
your
relatives
really
ellen
this
has
all
been
so
sudden
that
i
had
no
opportunity
said
julia
gently
but
it
did
not
seem
likely
that
you
would
object
for
you
suggested
yourself
that
i
rent
the
house
and
you
said
you
did
not
want
me
to
stay
here
alone
this
seemed
quite
providential
providential
sniffed
ellen
providential
to
take
you
away
from
your
own
home
and
your
own
people
and
send
you
out
into
a
world
where
nobody
really
cares
for
you
and
where
all
they
want
of
you
is
to
make
a
drudge
of
you
you
call
that
providential
do
you
well
i
and
when
i
object
and
try
to
save
you
from
yourself
and
offer
you
a
good
home
where
you
will
be
cared
for
all
the
rest
of
your
days
right
among
your
own
where
mother
would
have
wanted
to
see
you
you
will
probably
get
and
say
i
am
interfering
with
your
rights
but
i
ca
help
it
i
got
to
speak
i
ca
see
you
put
the
halter
around
your
neck
to
hang
yourself
without
doing
everything
i
can
to
stop
it
my
own
sister
why
ellen
dear
said
julia
cloud
eagerly
sitting
down
beside
her
sister
you
do
understand
it
is
in
the
least
that
way
sorry
i
had
to
spring
it
on
you
so
suddenly
and
give
you
such
a
wrong
impression
you
know
i
could
think
of
coming
to
live
on
you
and
herbert
it
was
kind
of
you
to
suggest
it
and
i
am
grateful
and
all
that
but
i
know
how
it
would
be
to
have
some
one
else
even
a
sister
come
into
the
home
and
i
could
think
of
it
i
have
always
resolved
that
i
would
never
be
dependent
on
my
relatives
while
i
had
my
health
ellen
sat
up
bristling
and
yet
you
are
willing
to
go
away
to
some
strange
place
where
nobody
knows
you
and
slave
for
a
couple
of
little
snobs
o
ellen
said
julia
pleadingly
you
do
understand
i
am
not
going
to
slave
i
just
going
to
be
a
sort
of
mother
to
them
and
you
ought
to
call
them
snobs
they
are
your
own
brother
children
own
brother
children
nothing
sneered
ellen
he
been
away
so
many
years
he
was
just
like
a
stranger
when
he
came
back
the
last
time
and
as
for
the
children
they
are
just
like
his
wife
and
her
family
yet
you
leave
the
children
that
were
born
and
raised
close
beside
you
and
go
and
slave
for
them
mother
fiddlesticks
you
slave
all
right
i
know
you
in
six
weeks
you
be
a
drudge
for
them
the
way
you
been
all
your
life
i
know
how
it
is
and
you
may
not
believe
it
but
i
have
feelings
for
my
sister
and
i
like
to
see
her
put
upon
ellen
fumbled
for
her
handkerchief
and
managed
a
comely
tear
or
two
that
quite
touched
julia
heart
affection
between
them
even
when
ellen
was
a
child
had
been
quite
for
ellen
had
always
been
a
selfish
spoiled
little
thing
and
julia
had
looked
in
vain
for
any
signs
of
tenderness
now
her
heart
warmed
toward
her
younger
sister
in
this
thoughtfulness
and
her
tone
grew
gentler
that
dear
of
you
ellen
and
i
appreciate
it
but
i
have
been
able
to
make
you
understand
yet
i
see
i
not
to
be
a
worker
nor
even
a
housekeeper
i
to
be
just
a
sort
of
mother
or
aunt
if
you
please
to
see
that
the
house
runs
all
right
to
be
with
the
children
and
have
a
happy
time
with
them
and
their
young
friends
and
to
see
that
they
are
cared
for
in
every
way
necessary
just
a
housemother
you
understand
i
am
to
have
servants
to
do
the
work
although
sure
one
servant
will
be
all
that
i
shall
want
in
a
little
household
like
that
but
luddington
quite
insisted
there
should
be
servants
and
that
no
work
of
any
sort
should
fall
upon
me
he
said
that
as
their
nearest
relative
i
was
to
be
in
the
position
of
mother
and
guardian
to
them
and
to
preside
over
their
home
that
ridiculous
put
in
ellen
why
do
they
go
to
college
and
board
like
any
other
reasonable
young
folks
if
they
must
go
to
college
at
all
i
think
it
all
nonsense
for
to
go
what
do
they
do
it
for
they
got
money
and
do
have
to
teach
or
anything
what
do
they
need
of
learning
they
got
enough
now
to
get
along
that
girl
thinks
she
too
smart
to
live
i
call
her
impudent
for
my
part
they
want
a
home
said
julia
waiving
the
subject
of
higher
education
and
they
have
chosen
me
and
i
mean
to
do
my
best
there
was
a
quiet
finality
in
her
tone
that
impressed
her
sister
she
looked
at
her
angrily
well
if
you
will
you
will
i
suppose
nobody
can
stop
you
but
i
see
just
what
will
come
of
it
you
fool
away
a
little
while
there
and
find
out
how
mistaken
you
were
and
then
you
come
back
to
herbert
to
be
taken
care
of
and
you
do
realize
how
offended
herbert
is
going
to
be
by
your
actions
and
how
he
feel
about
letting
you
come
back
after
you
have
gone
away
in
such
high
feather
you
have
anything
to
speak
of
to
support
yourself
of
course
and
how
on
earth
do
you
expect
to
live
anyway
after
these
children
get
through
their
college
and
get
married
or
something
they
wo
want
you
then
julia
arose
and
went
to
the
window
to
get
calmed
she
was
more
angry
than
she
had
been
for
years
the
thought
of
herbert
having
to
take
care
of
her
ever
was
intolerable
but
she
was
able
to
hold
her
tongue
until
she
could
get
her
eyes
on
those
hills
out
of
the
window
i
will
lift
up
mine
eyes
unto
the
hills
from
whence
cometh
my
help
that
had
been
the
verse
which
she
had
read
from
her
little
bible
before
leaving
her
room
in
the
early
morning
and
she
was
grappling
it
close
to
her
heart
for
she
had
known
it
would
be
a
hard
day
ellen
was
watching
her
silently
almost
she
thought
she
had
made
an
impression
perhaps
this
was
the
time
to
repeat
herbert
threat
herbert
feels
she
began
that
if
you
refuse
his
offer
now
he
promise
to
keep
it
open
he
ca
be
responsible
for
you
if
you
take
this
step
he
said
he
wanted
you
to
understand
thoroughly
julia
cloud
turned
and
walked
with
swift
step
to
the
little
parlor
where
lay
the
paper
she
and
luddington
had
just
signed
and
a
copy
of
which
he
had
taken
with
him
she
returned
to
her
astonished
sister
with
the
paper
in
her
hand
perhaps
it
would
be
just
as
well
for
you
to
read
this
she
said
with
dignity
and
put
the
paper
into
ellen
hands
going
back
to
her
clearing
of
the
table
there
was
silence
in
the
while
ellen
read
julia
moving
on
quiet
feet
about
the
table
putting
things
to
rights
she
had
finished
her
part
of
the
argument
she
was
resolutely
putting
out
of
her
mind
the
things
her
sister
had
just
said
and
refusing
altogether
to
think
of
herbert
she
knew
in
her
heart
just
how
herbert
had
looked
when
he
had
said
those
things
even
to
the
snarl
at
the
corner
of
his
nose
she
knew
too
that
ellen
had
probably
not
reported
the
message
even
so
disagreeably
as
the
original
and
she
knew
that
it
would
be
better
to
forget
well
said
ellen
rising
after
a
long
perusal
laying
the
paper
on
the
table
that
sounds
all
very
well
in
writing
the
thing
is
to
see
how
it
comes
out
the
proof
of
the
pudding
is
in
the
eating
and
you
need
tell
me
that
any
man
in
his
senses
will
pay
all
that
salary
merely
for
a
as
he
calls
it
if
he
does
he
a
fool
that
all
i
got
to
say
but
i
suppose
nothing
short
of
getting
caught
in
a
trap
will
make
you
see
it
so
i
better
save
my
breath
sure
i
hope
you
wo
go
to
the
poorhouse
through
your
stubbornness
i
done
all
i
could
to
keep
you
from
it
and
it
pretty
hard
to
have
my
only
sister
leave
me
so
after
mother
death
well
ellen
said
julia
cloud
looking
at
her
speculatively
sure
i
never
dreamed
you
cared
about
having
me
away
from
here
never
shown
much
interest
in
being
with
me
but
i
sorry
if
you
feel
it
that
way
and
i
sure
i
write
to
you
and
try
to
do
little
things
for
the
children
often
now
that
i
shall
have
something
to
do
with
but
her
kindly
feeling
was
cut
short
by
ellen
interrupting
her
oh
you
need
trouble
yourself
we
can
look
after
the
children
ourselves
you
better
save
what
you
get
to
look
after
yourself
when
those
two
get
over
this
whim
and
then
to
her
great
relief
julia
cloud
heard
the
car
returning
from
the
station
and
the
two
young
people
rushing
into
the
hall
chapter
vii
i
going
to
put
on
that
calico
wrapper
you
loaned
me
aunt
jewel
shouted
leslie
putting
a
rosy
face
into
the
for
an
instant
and
then
vanishing
i
bought
a
pair
of
overalls
at
the
store
as
you
suggested
cloudy
put
in
allison
waving
a
pair
of
blue
jeans
at
her
and
vanishing
also
ellen
robinson
stood
mopping
her
eyes
and
staring
out
from
the
window
not
at
the
hills
and
sniffing
i
should
think
you
stop
them
calling
you
that
ridiculous
name
she
snorted
it
is
respectful
it
sounds
like
making
fun
of
the
family
poor
ellen
robinson
she
had
her
good
points
but
a
sense
of
humor
was
one
of
them
also
it
went
against
the
grain
to
give
up
her
own
way
and
she
could
remember
when
she
had
planned
for
the
freedom
she
would
have
when
julia
came
to
live
with
her
having
an
entirely
different
temperament
from
julia
and
no
spiritual
outlook
whatever
on
life
she
was
unable
to
understand
what
thraldom
she
had
been
preparing
and
planning
for
her
patient
elder
sister
a
little
of
this
perhaps
penetrated
to
julia
cloud
disturbed
consciousness
as
she
watched
her
sister
irate
back
for
when
she
spoke
again
it
was
in
a
gentle
soothing
tone
there
now
ellen
let
forget
it
all
and
just
put
it
away
i
shall
be
coming
back
to
see
you
now
and
then
perhaps
and
you
can
come
and
see
me
that
be
something
new
to
look
forward
to
suppose
now
we
just
get
to
work
and
see
what
to
be
done
have
you
decided
what
you
want
to
have
taken
over
to
the
house
it
is
doubtful
whether
ellen
would
have
succumbed
so
easily
had
not
the
two
young
people
returned
just
then
and
demanded
that
they
have
something
to
do
as
quietly
as
if
she
were
used
to
packing
and
moving
every
year
of
her
life
julia
cloud
gave
them
each
a
pile
of
newspapers
and
set
them
to
wrapping
and
packing
dishes
in
a
big
barrel
and
ellen
was
forced
to
join
in
and
say
what
she
wanted
to
have
of
her
mother
things
without
a
word
julia
set
aside
anything
ellen
asked
for
even
when
it
was
something
she
would
have
liked
to
keep
herself
and
ellen
her
lips
pursed
and
her
eyes
bright
with
defeat
went
from
room
to
room
picking
and
choosing
as
if
she
were
at
an
auction
allison
still
in
overalls
rushed
out
in
the
car
and
got
a
man
with
a
and
before
twelve
ellen
robinson
saw
a
goodly
load
of
household
furniture
start
for
her
own
home
and
being
somewhat
anxious
as
to
how
it
would
be
disposed
on
its
arrival
she
took
the
car
and
sped
away
to
placate
herbert
she
really
felt
quite
triumphant
at
the
ease
with
which
she
had
secured
several
valuable
pieces
of
mahogany
which
she
knew
had
always
been
favorites
with
julia
gee
said
allison
as
the
car
vanished
out
of
sight
is
aunt
ellen
some
depressor
was
she
always
so
awfully
grown
up
i
say
cloudy
you
wo
get
that
way
will
you
when
we
get
you
off
in
our
house
if
you
do
take
poison
or
get
married
or
something
say
cloudy
jewel
you
twenty
years
younger
than
she
is
do
you
know
it
now
what
i
do
next
that
closet
is
all
empty
shall
i
begin
on
this
one
you
want
this
barrel
up
in
the
attic
you
say
all
right
here
goes
no
i
wo
hurt
my
back
i
strong
as
a
horse
i
know
how
to
lift
things
without
hurting
myself
open
that
door
leslie
and
move
that
chair
out
of
my
way
which
corner
shall
i
stow
it
cloudy
southwest
all
right
and
he
vanished
up
the
stairs
with
his
barrel
at
twelve
a
man
and
a
woman
arrived
whom
julia
cloud
had
hired
to
help
and
the
house
was
like
a
busy
hive
not
a
drone
among
them
it
really
was
wonderful
how
short
a
time
it
took
to
dismantle
a
home
that
had
been
running
for
years
but
the
hands
were
wonderfully
eager
that
took
hold
of
the
work
and
they
went
at
things
with
a
will
moreover
julia
cloud
domain
was
always
in
perfect
order
which
made
a
big
difference
they
ate
their
lunch
from
the
pantry
shelf
because
ellen
had
taken
the
table
but
it
was
a
good
lunch
bread
and
butter
apple
butter
cookies
half
a
custard
pie
and
glasses
of
rich
foamy
milk
then
they
went
to
work
again
the
children
were
smudged
with
dust
and
tumbled
and
happy
they
were
doing
real
things
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
and
they
liked
it
moreover
they
were
bringing
to
pass
a
beloved
plan
that
had
seemed
at
first
impossible
and
they
wanted
to
hustle
it
through
before
anything
spoiled
or
delayed
it
there
was
aunt
ellen
there
was
no
telling
what
she
might
not
do
to
hinder
and
julia
cloud
was
easily
troubled
by
her
sister
they
could
see
that
wise
children
that
they
were
so
they
worked
with
all
their
might
and
main
two
more
men
were
requisitioned
and
the
furniture
began
a
steady
march
up
to
the
attic
where
it
was
to
be
stored
leslie
developed
a
talent
for
finding
the
place
where
she
was
most
needed
and
getting
to
work
she
put
the
sideboard
drawers
in
order
and
then
went
to
packing
away
garments
from
the
closets
in
drawers
and
trunks
and
chests
until
by
four
a
great
many
little
nooks
and
corners
in
the
house
were
absolutely
clear
and
empty
ready
for
the
cleaning
before
the
new
tenants
arrived
although
to
tell
the
truth
there
was
scarcely
a
spot
in
julia
cloud
house
that
needed
much
cleaning
because
it
had
always
been
kept
immaculate
when
ellen
robinson
in
her
car
arrived
in
sight
of
the
house
at
four
she
identified
the
parlor
and
carpets
hanging
on
a
line
strung
across
the
back
yard
and
two
bedroom
carpets
being
beaten
in
the
side
yard
perkins
from
her
patient
had
also
identified
them
and
hurried
out
to
greet
her
friend
and
get
more
accurate
information
but
ellen
was
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
get
inside
and
secure
several
other
articles
which
she
had
thought
of
and
desired
to
have
to
spend
much
time
in
gossip
besides
if
julia
was
really
going
it
was
just
as
well
to
make
as
much
of
it
as
possible
so
she
greeted
perkins
as
one
too
busy
with
important
affairs
to
tell
details
and
hurried
into
the
house
standing
within
the
old
hallway
she
gazed
about
startled
how
on
earth
had
julia
managed
to
tear
up
things
in
such
a
hurry
the
pictures
had
all
vanished
from
the
walls
the
books
were
gone
from
the
old
the
furniture
itself
was
being
carried
away
the
table
being
the
last
piece
left
the
woman
was
washing
the
parlor
floor
slopping
on
the
soapy
water
with
that
air
of
finality
that
made
ellen
robinson
realize
that
the
old
home
was
broken
up
at
last
grimly
she
walked
into
the
and
saw
immaculate
empty
closets
and
cleanly
shining
as
far
as
the
work
had
progressed
it
had
been
done
thoroughly
a
cheery
chatter
came
from
the
rooms
and
ellen
robinson
experienced
a
pang
of
real
jealousy
of
these
two
young
things
who
had
swept
in
and
carried
her
neglected
sister
by
storm
somehow
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
had
taken
something
that
belonged
to
her
and
she
began
to
feel
bereft
julia
ought
to
love
her
better
than
these
two
young
strangers
why
did
she
why
did
those
two
children
make
such
a
fuss
over
her
as
they
did
over
julia
it
certainly
was
strange
perhaps
some
gleam
of
perception
that
it
might
all
be
her
own
fault
began
to
filter
to
ellen
robinson
consciousness
as
she
stood
there
on
the
stairs
and
listened
to
the
pleasant
chatter
o
cloudy
dear
is
this
really
daddy
picture
when
he
was
a
little
boy
what
a
funny
collar
and
necktie
but
was
he
a
darling
i
love
the
way
his
hair
curls
around
his
face
i
can
remember
daddy
quite
well
mother
used
to
say
he
was
a
wonderful
man
i
think
he
must
have
been
a
good
deal
like
you
our
old
nurse
used
to
say
that
families
went
in
streaks
i
guess
you
and
daddy
were
off
the
same
streak
were
you
i
hope
allison
and
i
will
be
too
say
cloudy
ca
i
have
this
picture
of
daddy
to
hang
in
my
room
in
our
new
house
i
love
it
ellen
robinson
wondered
whether
they
had
classified
her
as
another
streak
and
somehow
the
thought
was
unpleasant
it
was
like
one
of
those
little
rare
mirrors
that
flash
us
a
look
now
and
then
in
which
we
see
oursel
as
ithers
see
us
and
are
warned
to
take
account
of
stock
as
she
climbed
the
old
stairs
ellen
robinson
took
account
of
herself
as
it
were
and
resolved
to
show
a
better
side
to
these
children
than
she
had
shown
heretofore
and
so
when
she
appeared
among
them
she
put
aside
her
grim
aspect
for
a
while
and
spoke
in
quite
an
affable
tone
well
you
certainly
can
work
the
contrast
was
so
great
that
both
the
young
people
blinked
at
her
in
wonder
and
a
smile
broke
out
on
leslie
lovely
face
somehow
it
warmed
aunt
ellen
heart
and
she
went
on
but
you
all
must
be
tired
you
better
come
up
to
our
house
for
supper
you
wo
have
any
chance
to
get
it
here
oh
we
do
mind
picnicking
said
leslie
hastily
then
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
aunt
face
and
her
natural
kindliness
came
to
the
front
but
of
course
that
would
be
lovely
if
it
wo
be
too
much
trouble
for
you
she
added
pleasantly
with
one
of
her
brilliant
smiles
although
she
could
see
allison
making
violent
motions
and
shaking
his
head
at
her
from
the
other
room
where
he
was
out
of
his
aunt
ellen
sight
leslie
really
had
a
lovely
nature
and
was
always
quick
to
discern
it
when
she
had
hurt
any
one
ellen
robinson
looked
at
her
suspiciously
alert
for
the
insult
always
but
yielded
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
to
the
girl
loveliness
was
it
something
in
leslie
eyes
that
reminded
ellen
of
her
big
brother
who
used
to
come
home
now
and
then
and
tease
her
and
bring
her
lovely
gifts
she
watched
leslie
a
moment
wistfully
and
then
with
a
sigh
turned
away
she
wished
one
of
her
little
girls
could
look
like
that
well
i
better
go
right
home
and
get
supper
ready
she
said
alertly
and
there
was
a
note
of
almost
pleased
eagerness
in
her
voice
that
she
was
included
in
this
function
of
packing
and
moving
that
seemed
somehow
to
have
turned
into
a
delightful
game
in
which
weariness
and
care
were
forgotten
i
have
supper
ready
to
dish
up
by
seven
she
admonished
her
astonished
sister
as
she
swept
past
the
bedroom
where
she
was
at
work
putting
away
blankets
and
pillows
in
camphor
you
wo
be
ready
much
before
that
but
do
you
be
a
minute
later
or
the
supper
will
be
spoiled
by
which
admonition
julia
cloud
became
aware
that
ellen
was
going
to
favor
them
with
some
of
her
famous
chicken
potpie
she
stood
still
for
a
whole
minute
with
a
light
in
her
eyes
and
a
smile
on
her
face
listening
to
ellen
retreating
footsteps
down
the
stairs
then
as
the
ford
set
up
its
churning
clatter
she
turned
back
to
her
task
and
murmured
softly
poor
ellen
the
supper
passed
off
very
well
herbert
was
a
trifle
gruff
and
silent
but
it
was
plain
that
allison
stories
amused
him
for
now
and
then
a
crept
into
his
stolid
countenance
julia
cloud
was
so
glad
that
she
could
have
cried
she
hated
scenes
and
she
dreaded
being
at
outs
with
her
relatives
so
she
ate
her
chicken
potpie
and
fresh
thankfully
and
forgot
how
weary
she
was
after
supper
leslie
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
rattled
off
and
she
and
allison
sang
song
after
song
while
the
children
stood
about
admiringly
and
even
herbert
sat
by
as
at
a
social
function
and
listened
the
atmosphere
was
really
quite
clear
when
at
last
they
prepared
to
leave
and
julia
cloud
had
an
inkling
that
the
big
blue
car
had
something
to
do
with
it
that
some
car
you
got
said
herbert
patronizingly
as
he
held
a
lantern
for
them
to
get
down
the
steps
get
it
this
year
what
do
you
have
to
pay
for
that
make
now
i
thinking
of
getting
a
new
one
myself
pretty
soon
down
upon
their
knees
in
the
went
the
two
men
of
the
party
examining
this
and
that
point
of
interest
their
noses
turned
to
the
mysterious
inner
workings
of
the
wonderful
mechanism
while
julia
cloud
sat
and
marveled
that
here
at
last
was
something
which
herbert
robinson
respected
and
ellen
stood
upon
the
steps
really
smiling
and
saying
how
nice
it
had
been
to
have
them
for
all
the
world
as
if
they
were
company
all
the
hard
lines
of
her
rapidly
maturing
face
softened
by
kindliness
it
seemed
like
a
miracle
julia
cloud
settled
back
into
the
deep
cushions
and
lifted
her
eyes
to
the
dark
line
of
the
hills
against
the
sky
from
whence
cometh
my
help
trailed
the
words
through
her
tired
brain
and
her
heart
murmured
god
i
thank
thee
chapter
viii
they
all
slept
very
late
the
next
morning
being
utterly
worn
out
from
the
unaccustomed
work
and
when
they
finally
got
they
took
a
sort
of
a
off
the
pantry
shelves
again
it
was
strange
how
good
even
biscuit
and
milk
can
taste
when
one
has
been
working
hard
and
has
a
young
appetite
although
leslie
and
allison
had
been
known
to
scorn
all
cereals
still
there
were
cookies
and
wonderful
apples
from
the
big
tree
in
the
back
yard
for
dessert
when
are
those
men
coming
back
to
finish
up
suddenly
demanded
leslie
poising
a
glass
of
milk
and
a
cooky
in
one
hand
and
taking
a
great
bite
from
her
apple
not
till
said
julia
cloud
looking
around
the
empty
kitchen
speculatively
and
wondering
how
in
the
world
she
was
going
to
cook
with
all
the
packed
in
the
attic
we
ought
to
have
left
the
kitchen
till
last
she
added
with
a
troubled
look
you
crazy
children
did
you
know
we
had
to
eat
i
told
that
man
not
to
take
any
of
those
things
on
the
that
they
were
to
stay
down
until
the
very
last
thing
and
now
he
has
taken
the
table
even
i
went
to
see
if
i
could
get
at
things
and
i
find
he
has
put
them
away
at
the
back
and
piled
all
the
chairs
and
some
in
front
of
them
i
afraid
we
shall
have
to
get
some
things
out
again
i
do
see
how
we
can
get
along
not
a
bit
of
it
cloudy
said
leslie
giving
a
spring
and
perching
herself
on
the
of
the
sink
where
she
sat
swinging
her
dainty
little
pumps
as
nonchalantly
as
if
she
were
sitting
on
a
velvet
sofa
see
here
my
plan
i
woke
up
early
and
thought
it
all
out
let
see
consulting
her
wee
it
nine
that
is
bad
now
we
work
till
twelve
that
long
enough
for
because
you
got
too
tired
yesterday
and
besides
we
got
some
other
things
to
attend
to
then
we
hustle
into
the
car
and
get
to
town
and
do
some
shopping
ready
for
our
trip
that
will
rest
you
we
get
lunch
at
a
and
shop
all
the
afternoon
we
go
to
a
hotel
for
dinner
and
stay
all
night
then
in
the
morning
we
can
get
up
early
have
our
breakfast
and
drive
back
here
in
time
before
the
men
come
now
is
that
perfectly
for
a
plan
leslie
but
dear
that
would
cost
a
lot
and
besides
it
is
in
the
least
necessary
cost
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
look
and
leslie
flourished
a
handful
of
bills
see
what
guardy
lud
gave
me
and
allison
has
another
just
like
it
he
said
particularly
that
we
were
not
to
let
you
get
all
worked
out
and
get
sick
so
you
could
go
with
us
and
he
particularly
told
us
about
a
lot
of
things
he
wanted
us
to
buy
to
make
things
easy
on
the
way
after
he
leaves
us
and
goes
back
to
california
we
in
your
charge
i
know
but
just
now
you
in
ours
you
dear
unselfish
darling
and
we
going
to
run
you
oh
we
going
to
run
you
to
beat
the
band
laughed
leslie
and
jumped
down
from
her
perch
to
hug
and
squeeze
the
breath
out
of
julia
cloud
but
child
dear
said
that
good
woman
when
she
could
get
her
breath
to
speak
you
must
begin
in
that
extravagant
way
but
they
put
their
hands
over
her
lips
and
laughed
away
her
protests
until
she
had
to
give
up
for
laughing
with
them
well
then
she
said
at
last
when
they
had
subsided
from
a
regular
frolic
for
all
the
world
as
if
they
were
children
have
to
get
to
work
in
good
earnest
only
it
does
seem
right
to
let
you
work
so
hard
when
you
are
visiting
me
visiting
nothing
declared
allison
we
having
the
time
of
our
lives
i
have
been
in
a
place
where
i
could
do
as
i
pleased
since
i
was
eight
years
old
this
is
real
work
and
i
like
it
come
now
let
waste
any
time
what
can
i
do
first
would
you
like
to
have
me
take
down
all
the
pictures
on
the
second
floor
stack
them
in
the
attic
and
sweep
down
the
walls
the
way
we
did
down
here
yesterday
yes
said
their
aunt
with
an
affectionate
homage
in
her
eyes
for
this
dear
capable
boy
who
was
so
eager
over
everything
as
if
it
were
his
own
and
those
big
bookcases
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
books
do
you
want
any
of
them
to
go
with
you
or
are
they
to
be
packed
away
no
i
wo
take
any
of
those
books
they
need
to
be
dusted
and
put
in
boxes
there
are
a
lot
of
boxes
in
the
cellar
and
there
a
pile
of
papers
to
use
for
lining
the
boxes
but
you
have
your
hands
full
with
the
pictures
i
think
let
the
books
go
till
allison
went
whistling
and
began
taking
down
the
pictures
but
anybody
could
see
by
the
set
of
his
shoulders
that
he
meant
to
get
the
books
out
of
the
way
too
before
noon
now
what
can
i
do
said
leslie
whirling
around
from
wiping
the
last
cup
and
plate
they
had
used
there
one
more
bureau
besides
yours
does
it
need
emptying
out
no
dear
that
has
your
grandmother
things
in
it
and
is
in
perfect
order
she
had
me
fix
up
the
things
several
months
ago
everything
is
tied
up
and
labelled
i
do
think
we
need
to
disturb
it
the
men
can
move
it
up
as
it
is
but
we
need
to
get
the
rest
of
the
out
on
the
line
for
an
airing
before
i
pack
them
away
in
the
chest
you
might
do
that
so
leslie
went
back
and
forth
carrying
blankets
and
quilts
and
hanging
them
on
the
line
till
perkins
had
to
come
over
to
see
what
was
going
on
she
came
with
a
cup
in
her
hand
to
ask
for
some
and
julia
cloud
gave
her
the
whole
box
no
you
need
return
it
she
said
smiling
i
shall
not
need
it
i
rented
the
house
and
am
going
away
for
a
while
perkins
was
so
astonished
that
she
actually
went
home
without
finding
out
where
julia
cloud
was
going
and
had
to
come
back
to
see
whether
there
was
anything
she
could
do
to
help
in
order
to
get
a
chance
to
ask
it
was
really
quite
astonishing
what
a
lot
could
be
done
in
three
hours
when
twelve
came
the
two
children
descended
upon
their
aunt
with
insistence
that
she
wash
her
hands
and
put
on
her
hat
the
rooms
had
assumed
that
ready
look
that
rests
the
tired
worker
just
to
look
around
and
see
what
has
been
accomplished
with
a
conviction
that
she
was
being
quite
a
child
to
run
away
this
way
when
there
was
still
a
lot
to
be
done
but
with
an
overwhelming
desire
to
yield
to
the
pressure
julia
cloud
surrendered
when
she
came
five
minutes
later
in
her
neat
black
suit
and
small
black
hat
with
the
mourning
veil
about
it
that
ellen
had
insisted
upon
for
the
funeral
the
car
was
already
at
the
door
and
she
felt
almost
guilty
as
she
locked
the
door
and
went
down
the
path
but
the
beauty
of
the
day
intoxicated
her
at
once
and
she
forgot
immediately
everything
but
the
joy
of
riding
out
into
the
world
leslie
was
a
bit
quiet
as
they
glided
down
the
road
out
of
town
and
kept
eyeing
her
aunt
silently
at
last
as
julia
cloud
was
calling
attention
to
a
wonderful
red
woodbine
that
had
twined
itself
about
an
old
dead
tree
and
was
setting
the
roadside
ablaze
with
splendor
leslie
caught
her
eye
what
is
it
dear
does
something
trouble
you
is
anything
wrong
with
me
asked
julia
cloud
putting
up
a
prospecting
hand
to
her
hair
and
hat
leslie
cheeks
went
rosy
red
o
cloudy
dear
said
leslie
i
was
just
wondering
but
i
afraid
to
say
it
maybe
it
will
make
you
feel
bad
not
a
bit
deary
what
is
it
well
then
cloudy
do
you
think
grandmother
would
care
very
much
if
you
did
wear
black
do
you
like
it
yourself
or
feel
it
would
be
right
not
to
wear
it
i
do
mean
any
disrespect
to
grandmother
but
oh
you
would
look
so
sweet
in
gray
gray
and
lavender
and
soft
pink
or
just
gray
now
for
a
while
are
you
very
mad
at
me
for
saying
it
julia
cloud
reached
over
and
patted
the
young
hand
that
lay
near
her
on
the
seat
why
no
dear
i
not
mad
and
i
do
care
for
black
myself
i
do
believe
in
wearing
black
for
the
people
who
have
left
us
and
gone
to
heaven
it
seems
to
me
white
would
be
a
great
deal
better
but
i
put
on
these
things
to
please
ellen
she
thought
it
would
be
showing
great
disrespect
to
mother
if
i
did
and
rather
than
argue
about
it
i
did
as
she
wanted
me
to
but
i
do
intend
to
darken
the
place
around
me
by
dressing
in
mourning
child
and
i
glad
you
do
want
me
to
i
like
bright
happy
things
and
besides
leslie
dear
your
grandmother
was
a
bright
happy
woman
herself
once
when
she
was
young
before
she
was
sick
and
had
trouble
and
i
like
to
remember
her
that
way
because
i
sure
that
is
the
way
she
looks
now
in
heaven
oh
i
so
glad
sighed
leslie
that
makes
the
day
just
perfect
i
think
i
wait
until
i
get
away
to
change
however
said
julia
cloud
thoughtfully
it
would
just
annoy
ellen
to
do
it
now
and
might
make
such
people
as
perkins
say
disagreeable
things
that
would
make
it
unpleasant
for
your
aunt
of
course
said
leslie
nestling
closer
her
eyes
dancing
with
some
secret
plans
of
her
own
that
all
right
cloudy
how
dear
and
sort
of
you
are
just
like
a
real
mother
and
somehow
julia
cloud
felt
as
if
she
was
entering
into
a
new
world
allison
seemed
to
know
by
intuition
just
where
to
find
the
right
kind
of
he
ushered
them
into
the
place
and
found
a
table
in
a
secluded
nook
with
a
fountain
playing
nearby
over
ferns
and
ivy
climbing
over
a
mimic
pergola
there
were
not
many
people
eating
for
it
was
past
one
there
were
little
round
tables
with
chairs
that
seemed
to
shut
them
off
in
a
corner
by
themselves
this
is
nice
he
sighed
we
a
real
family
now
are
we
and
he
looked
over
at
julia
cloud
with
that
fine
homage
that
now
and
then
a
boy
just
entering
manhood
renders
to
an
older
woman
creamed
chicken
on
toast
toasted
muffins
and
with
hot
chocolate
sauce
ordered
allison
after
studying
the
for
a
moment
you
like
all
those
do
you
cloudy
oh
but
my
dear
you
must
order
all
that
a
sandwich
is
all
i
need
just
a
tongue
sandwich
you
must
not
begin
by
being
extravagant
this
is
my
party
cloudy
this
goes
under
the
head
of
expenses
if
you
ca
find
enough
you
like
among
what
i
order
why
i
get
you
a
tongue
sandwich
too
but
you
been
feeding
us
out
of
the
and
i
guess
i
get
the
finest
i
can
find
to
pay
you
back
i
told
you
this
was
my
time
when
we
get
settled
you
can
order
things
but
now
i
going
to
see
that
you
get
enough
to
eat
while
you
working
so
hard
leslie
eyes
danced
with
her
dimples
as
julia
cloud
appealed
to
her
to
stop
this
extravagance
that
all
right
cloudy
i
heard
guardy
lud
tell
al
not
to
spare
any
expense
to
make
things
comfortable
for
you
while
you
were
moving
so
julia
cloud
settled
down
to
the
pleasure
of
a
new
and
delicious
combination
of
foods
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
all
now
said
leslie
as
the
meal
drew
to
a
close
we
must
get
to
work
it
two
and
the
stores
close
at
five
i
a
lot
of
shopping
to
do
how
about
you
cloudy
i
must
buy
a
trunk
said
julia
cloud
thoughtfully
and
a
and
some
gloves
i
ought
to
get
a
new
warm
coat
but
that
will
do
later
leslie
eyed
her
thoughtfully
and
raised
one
brow
intensively
at
her
brother
as
she
rose
from
the
table
allison
landed
them
at
a
big
department
store
and
guided
his
aunt
to
the
trunk
department
with
instructions
to
stay
there
until
he
and
leslie
came
back
then
they
went
off
with
great
glee
and
many
whisperings
it
is
a
curious
thing
how
easily
and
quickly
young
people
can
shop
provided
they
have
plenty
of
money
and
no
older
person
by
to
hamper
them
allison
and
leslie
were
back
within
the
time
they
had
set
looking
very
meek
and
satisfied
leslie
carried
a
small
package
which
she
laid
in
julia
cloud
lap
you
said
you
needed
a
she
said
and
i
came
on
a
place
where
they
were
having
a
sale
i
thought
this
was
a
peach
so
i
bought
it
if
you
do
like
it
we
can
give
it
to
aunt
ellen
or
some
one
julia
cloud
cheeks
grew
pink
with
pleasure
and
she
felt
like
a
very
young
happy
child
as
she
opened
the
parcel
to
find
a
lovely
gray
suède
with
silver
clasp
and
fittings
containing
quite
a
little
outfit
of
toilet
articles
and
brushes
in
neat
compact
form
she
caught
her
breath
with
delight
as
she
touched
the
soft
white
leather
lining
and
noticed
the
perfection
and
finish
of
the
whole
it
seemed
fit
for
a
queen
yet
was
plain
and
quiet
enough
on
the
outside
for
a
dove
to
carry
she
looked
up
to
see
the
two
pairs
of
eager
eyes
upon
her
and
could
hardly
refrain
from
throwing
her
arms
about
the
children
right
there
in
the
store
but
she
stopped
in
time
and
let
her
eyes
do
the
caressing
as
she
said
with
a
tremble
in
her
low
sweet
voice
o
you
dear
children
how
you
are
going
to
spoil
me
i
see
i
must
get
settled
quickly
so
that
i
shall
have
the
power
to
restrain
you
they
rollicked
forth
then
and
bought
several
things
a
big
steamer
rug
for
the
car
a
pair
of
long
gray
mocha
gloves
to
match
the
a
silk
umbrella
and
for
aunt
ellen
a
shiny
black
with
a
number
of
conveniences
in
it
and
a
pair
of
new
black
gloves
with
long
warm
wrists
tucked
inside
of
it
then
allison
thoughtfully
suggested
a
handsome
leather
wallet
for
uncle
herbert
and
julia
cloud
lingered
by
the
and
selected
half
a
dozen
new
fine
handkerchiefs
it
all
seemed
just
like
a
play
to
her
it
was
so
very
long
since
she
had
been
shopping
herself
ellen
had
bought
everything
for
her
for
years
because
she
was
always
too
busy
or
too
burdened
to
get
away
when
they
were
out
in
the
street
again
it
was
still
too
early
to
think
of
going
to
the
hotel
for
dinner
how
about
a
movie
cloudy
asked
allison
shyly
there
a
pippin
down
the
street
a
ways
i
saw
it
as
we
came
by
or
do
you
like
movies
perhaps
you
rather
go
to
the
hotel
and
lie
down
i
suppose
you
are
maybe
worn
out
i
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
not
a
bit
of
it
said
the
game
little
woman
i
should
love
to
go
maybe
you
wo
believe
it
but
i
never
went
to
a
movie
in
my
life
and
i
been
wanting
to
know
what
they
were
like
for
a
long
time
never
went
to
a
movie
in
your
life
why
cloudy
you
poor
dear
said
allison
who
had
been
fairly
fed
on
movies
why
how
did
it
happen
do
they
have
moving
pictures
in
your
town
yes
they
have
them
now
though
only
a
year
or
so
ago
but
you
know
i
never
been
able
to
get
away
even
if
they
had
been
all
about
me
besides
i
suppose
i
should
have
been
considered
crazy
if
i
had
gone
me
an
oldish
woman
if
there
had
been
children
to
take
it
would
have
been
different
i
suppose
it
is
a
childish
desire
but
i
always
loved
pictures
well
we
going
said
allison
get
in
quick
and
i
have
you
there
before
you
say
jack
robinson
and
so
in
the
restful
cool
of
a
atmosphere
in
one
of
the
finest
places
in
the
city
julia
cloud
sat
with
her
two
children
and
saw
her
first
moving
picture
holding
her
breath
in
wonder
and
delight
as
the
people
on
the
screen
lived
and
moved
before
her
i
afraid
i
having
too
good
a
time
she
said
quietly
as
she
settled
back
in
the
car
again
and
was
whirled
away
to
the
hotel
i
feel
as
if
i
were
a
child
again
if
this
keeps
on
i
wo
have
dignity
enough
left
to
chaperon
you
properly
oh
but
cloudy
dear
that
just
why
we
want
you
because
you
know
how
to
be
young
and
play
with
us
clamored
both
of
them
together
then
after
a
good
dinner
they
went
up
to
their
rooms
and
there
was
julia
cloud
shining
new
trunk
that
had
to
be
looked
over
and
there
on
the
floor
beside
it
stood
two
packages
big
boxes
both
of
them
this
must
be
a
mistake
said
julia
cloud
looking
at
them
curiously
allison
you
better
call
the
boy
and
have
him
take
them
away
to
the
right
room
allison
picked
up
the
top
package
a
big
square
box
why
this
is
your
name
cloudy
jewel
he
exclaimed
it
must
be
yours
open
it
but
how
could
it
be
said
julia
cloud
perplexedly
open
it
cloudy
i
want
to
see
what
in
it
julia
cloud
was
bending
over
the
long
pasteboard
box
on
the
floor
and
finding
her
name
on
that
too
it
very
strange
she
said
her
cheeks
beginning
to
grow
pink
like
those
of
a
child
on
her
first
christmas
morning
i
suppose
it
some
more
of
your
extravagant
capers
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
with
you
but
her
eager
fingers
untied
the
string
while
leslie
and
allison
executed
little
silent
dances
around
the
room
and
tried
to
stifle
their
mirth
the
cover
fell
off
at
last
and
the
blew
up
in
a
great
fluff
and
out
of
it
rolled
a
beautiful
long
soft
thick
gray
cloak
of
finest
texture
and
silken
lining
with
a
great
puffy
collar
and
cuffs
of
deep
soft
fox
was
all
julia
cloud
could
say
as
the
wonderful
garment
slipped
out
and
spread
about
over
the
box
and
floor
and
then
the
two
children
caught
it
up
and
enveloped
her
in
it
buttoning
it
down
the
front
and
turning
the
collar
around
her
ears
it
yours
cloudy
to
keep
you
warm
on
the
journey
cried
leslie
dancing
around
and
clapping
her
hands
does
she
look
lovely
in
it
allison
oh
is
she
dear
and
leslie
caught
her
and
whirled
her
around
the
room
then
allison
brought
the
big
square
box
and
demanded
that
it
be
opened
and
out
of
it
came
a
small
gray
hat
in
soft
silky
beaver
with
a
close
gray
feather
curled
quietly
about
it
that
settled
down
on
julia
cloud
lovely
white
hair
as
if
it
had
been
made
for
her
you
do
mind
do
you
cloudy
dear
you
do
think
i
officious
or
impertinent
begged
leslie
anxiously
it
was
allison
idea
to
get
the
hat
to
match
the
coat
and
it
was
such
a
dear
we
could
help
taking
it
but
if
there
is
anything
about
them
you
do
like
we
got
special
permission
for
you
to
exchange
them
morning
like
them
julia
cloud
settled
down
in
a
chair
and
looked
at
herself
in
helpless
joy
and
admiration
like
them
but
o
children
you
ought
to
have
got
such
wonderful
expensive
things
for
me
i
just
a
plain
simple
woman
you
know
and
it
not
fitting
then
there
arose
a
great
clamor
about
her
why
was
it
not
fitting
she
who
had
given
her
life
for
others
why
should
she
not
have
some
of
the
beautiful
comfortable
things
of
earth
it
was
sensible
for
her
to
talk
that
way
that
was
being
too
humble
and
besides
were
these
things
quite
sensible
and
practical
were
they
warm
and
they
be
convenient
and
comfortable
and
neat
well
then
finished
allison
and
so
at
last
they
said
and
went
to
their
beds
but
long
after
the
children
were
asleep
julia
cloud
lay
awake
and
thought
it
out
god
had
been
good
to
her
and
was
leading
her
into
green
pastures
beside
quiet
waters
but
there
were
things
he
was
expecting
of
her
and
was
she
going
to
be
able
to
fulfil
them
these
two
young
souls
were
hers
to
guide
would
she
have
the
grace
to
guide
them
into
the
knowledge
of
god
in
christ
and
then
she
lay
praying
for
strength
for
this
great
work
until
the
peace
of
god
sleep
dropped
down
upon
her
chapter
ix
the
next
two
days
were
busy
ones
there
were
a
great
many
last
little
things
to
be
done
and
julia
cloud
would
have
worked
herself
out
had
not
the
children
interfered
and
carried
her
off
for
a
ride
every
little
while
the
intervening
sabbath
was
spent
at
ellen
robinson
the
handsome
and
wallet
served
to
keep
ellen
from
being
very
disagreeable
in
fact
at
the
last
when
she
began
to
realize
that
julia
was
really
going
away
and
would
not
be
down
at
the
old
house
any
more
for
her
to
burden
and
torment
she
really
revealed
a
gleam
of
affection
for
her
and
quite
worried
poor
julia
with
thinking
that
perhaps
after
all
she
ought
not
to
go
away
so
far
from
her
only
sister
when
ellen
sat
down
on
the
bare
stairs
in
the
old
hall
monday
morning
and
gave
vent
to
a
real
sob
at
parting
julia
had
a
swift
vision
of
her
little
sister
years
ago
sitting
on
that
same
stair
weeping
from
a
fall
and
herself
comforting
her
and
she
put
her
arms
around
ellen
and
kissed
her
for
the
first
time
in
many
reticent
years
but
at
last
they
were
off
having
handed
over
the
keys
to
the
new
tenant
and
julia
cloud
leaned
back
on
the
luxurious
cushions
and
laughed
not
from
mirth
for
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
and
not
from
nervousness
for
she
was
never
subject
to
hysteria
but
just
from
sheer
excitement
and
joy
to
think
that
she
was
really
going
out
in
the
world
at
last
to
see
things
and
live
a
life
of
her
own
the
two
young
people
felt
it
and
laughed
with
her
until
the
blackbirds
swirling
in
a
rustling
chorus
overhead
on
their
way
south
seemed
to
be
joining
in
and
a
little
squirrel
whisked
across
the
road
and
sat
up
inquiringly
on
a
log
framed
in
scarlet
leaves
they
went
straight
to
the
city
for
luddington
had
promised
to
meet
them
there
and
confer
with
them
further
about
their
plans
but
when
they
reached
the
hotel
they
found
only
a
telegram
from
him
saying
that
business
had
held
him
longer
than
he
expected
and
that
he
should
have
to
arrange
to
meet
them
farther
along
in
their
journey
he
suggested
three
colleges
either
one
of
which
he
should
favor
and
outlined
their
journey
to
take
in
a
stop
at
each
he
promised
to
communicate
with
them
later
and
gave
his
own
address
in
case
they
decided
to
remain
at
either
the
first
or
the
second
place
visited
now
said
julia
cloud
after
the
telegram
was
disposed
of
i
want
to
get
a
new
dress
and
a
few
things
before
we
go
any
farther
i
know
you
children
do
like
these
old
black
things
and
we
might
as
well
start
out
right
it
wo
take
me
long
and
i
shall
be
ready
to
go
on
my
way
right
after
lunch
leslie
was
delighted
and
the
two
spent
two
hours
of
happiness
in
shopping
while
allison
drove
to
a
garage
to
have
his
car
looked
over
thoroughly
and
laid
in
a
supply
of
good
things
for
the
journey
he
also
spent
a
profitable
studying
a
and
asking
questions
concerning
the
journey
they
tried
to
make
julia
cloud
take
a
nap
before
they
started
but
she
declared
she
would
rather
rest
in
the
car
and
so
they
started
off
feeling
like
three
children
going
to
find
the
end
of
the
rainbow
it
was
a
wonderful
afternoon
the
air
was
like
wine
and
the
autumn
foliage
was
in
all
its
glory
as
they
flew
along
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
leaving
all
care
behind
a
soft
pink
color
grew
in
julia
cheeks
and
she
sat
with
her
hands
folded
and
her
eyes
bright
with
the
beauty
of
the
day
oh
but
you
a
beauty
cloudy
dear
exclaimed
leslie
suddenly
see
her
allison
just
look
at
her
is
she
great
she
was
all
right
in
those
black
things
of
course
but
she
wonderful
in
the
gray
things
for
julia
cloud
had
laid
aside
in
the
very
bottom
of
her
new
trunk
the
prim
black
serge
that
ellen
had
bought
and
the
black
funeral
gloves
and
coat
and
hat
and
she
was
wearing
a
lovely
soft
gray
wool
jersey
dress
with
white
collar
and
cuffs
the
big
gray
coat
was
nestled
by
her
side
ready
for
use
when
the
wind
grew
colder
and
she
was
wearing
the
new
gray
hat
and
gloves
and
looked
a
lady
every
inch
allison
turned
slowly
and
gave
her
a
look
that
made
her
blush
like
a
girl
i
should
say
she
great
she
a
peach
he
agreed
that
hat
is
a
cracker
jack
it
looks
like
a
pigeon
wing
i
like
it
do
you
cloudy
but
say
leslie
she
something
more
than
a
beauty
she
a
good
scout
that
what
she
is
do
you
realize
she
has
opened
her
lips
about
the
car
once
the
time
i
took
luddington
down
to
the
office
for
guardy
how
she
squeaked
every
time
another
car
went
by
and
cautioned
me
to
be
careful
and
go
slow
and
asked
me
how
many
times
i
had
ever
driven
before
and
if
i
was
exceeding
the
and
no
end
of
things
but
cloudy
has
batted
an
eye
she
just
sits
there
as
if
she
was
riding
a
cloud
and
enjoyed
it
well
i
do
said
julia
cloud
laughing
and
i
never
thought
of
being
afraid
i
did
know
enough
to
ought
i
to
because
i
having
such
a
good
time
that
i
afraid
i
forget
to
be
frightened
that
what
i
said
you
a
good
sport
i
believe
you
like
to
go
fast
julia
cloud
admitted
shamedly
that
she
did
he
a
splendid
driver
and
so
am
i
leslie
explained
earnestly
guardy
had
us
taught
ages
ago
and
we
driven
a
lot
only
of
course
we
did
have
our
own
car
we
just
had
the
regular
car
that
belongs
to
the
house
but
we
made
that
work
some
and
allison
took
a
full
course
in
cars
he
knows
how
to
repair
them
and
put
them
together
and
everything
shall
i
let
her
go
cloudy
asked
allison
eagerly
will
you
be
afraid
i
should
love
it
said
julia
cloud
eagerly
and
then
with
a
sober
look
at
the
boy
do
do
anything
crazy
dear
do
do
anything
that
you
ought
to
do
of
course
not
said
allison
gravely
sitting
up
with
a
manly
look
in
his
handsome
young
face
and
by
the
look
he
gave
her
she
knew
that
she
had
put
him
upon
his
honor
and
she
knew
that
he
would
take
no
risks
now
that
she
had
trusted
him
if
she
had
been
a
squealing
hectoring
kind
of
woman
he
might
have
been
challenged
into
taking
risks
but
not
here
when
she
trusted
him
and
the
responsibility
was
all
his
julia
cloud
as
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
prepared
to
enjoy
the
flight
down
the
white
ribbon
of
road
up
a
hill
and
down
another
registered
the
thought
that
here
was
a
clew
to
this
boy
character
trust
him
and
he
would
be
faithful
distrust
him
and
you
would
be
anywhere
it
did
not
come
to
her
in
words
that
way
but
rather
as
a
subconscious
fact
that
was
incorporated
into
her
soul
and
gave
her
a
solid
and
sure
feeling
about
her
boy
she
had
seen
all
that
in
his
eyes
he
turned
around
presently
and
told
her
how
fast
they
had
been
going
and
her
eyes
were
shining
as
brightly
as
leslie
you
a
pretty
good
pard
cloudy
he
said
we
make
you
a
member
of
the
gang
and
take
you
everywhere
see
you
being
initiated
now
and
you
making
good
right
along
i
knew
we
did
a
good
thing
when
we
came
after
you
did
we
les
and
leslie
turned
and
flung
herself
into
julia
cloud
arms
with
one
of
her
enthusiastic
hugs
it
was
just
evening
when
they
entered
the
little
town
about
twenty
miles
from
a
larger
city
where
was
located
a
seat
of
learning
which
had
been
highly
recommended
to
luddington
and
which
seemed
to
him
to
have
a
great
many
good
points
in
its
favor
the
warned
them
of
their
approach
and
the
three
sat
silently
watching
judging
the
place
from
the
outskirts
big
square
houses
and
lawns
multiplied
as
they
progressed
some
streets
had
fences
substantial
churches
rose
here
and
there
and
the
college
grounds
became
visible
as
they
neared
the
centre
of
the
town
the
buildings
were
spacious
and
attractive
with
tall
old
elms
and
maples
shading
the
broad
walks
there
was
an
ideal
chapel
of
stone
with
arches
and
a
wonderful
belfry
and
one
could
easily
imagine
young
men
and
maidens
flitting
here
and
there
the
two
young
people
studied
the
scene
as
the
car
drove
slowly
by
and
said
nothing
allison
went
on
to
the
other
end
of
town
till
the
houses
grew
farther
apart
and
nothing
had
been
said
then
leslie
drew
a
big
sigh
turn
around
brother
and
let
go
back
past
there
again
allison
turned
around
and
drove
slowly
by
the
college
grounds
again
there
are
at
the
back
said
leslie
and
that
looks
like
a
gym
over
there
do
you
suppose
that
the
athletic
field
over
at
the
back
they
drove
slowly
around
the
block
and
julia
cloud
sat
silently
trying
to
think
of
herself
in
this
strange
environment
and
feeling
suddenly
chilly
and
alone
there
would
be
a
lot
of
strange
people
to
meet
and
the
children
would
be
off
at
college
all
day
she
thought
of
that
try
some
of
the
side
streets
ordered
leslie
i
have
seen
our
house
yet
they
came
to
the
business
part
of
the
town
and
found
the
suggested
in
luddington
directions
we
ca
tell
much
about
it
said
allison
gravely
i
guess
we
better
get
some
supper
and
let
cloudy
jewel
get
rested
for
a
while
then
we
can
look
around
they
were
wise
words
and
julia
cloud
assented
at
once
but
it
was
quite
plain
that
neither
he
nor
leslie
was
much
elated
at
the
place
allison
slipped
out
for
a
walk
through
the
college
grounds
after
the
others
had
gone
to
their
rooms
and
came
back
whistling
gravely
he
does
like
it
cloudy
whispered
leslie
as
the
sound
floated
in
through
the
transom
he
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
it
you
see
what
makes
you
think
so
dear
he
whistling
that
sounds
as
if
he
liked
it
yes
but
look
what
he
whistling
he
always
begins
on
long
long
trail
if
he
is
pleased
or
has
to
wait
when
he
in
a
hurry
to
get
anywhere
now
if
he
had
been
pleased
you
would
have
heard
grasshopper
hopped
right
over
th
other
grasshopper
back
i
can
always
tell
well
i
do
care
do
you
cloudy
there
plenty
of
other
colleges
and
i
did
see
our
house
in
any
of
the
streets
we
went
through
did
you
julia
cloud
had
to
confess
that
she
had
not
been
in
love
with
anything
she
had
seen
yet
well
then
what
the
use
of
going
over
the
old
college
i
say
beat
it
in
the
morning
but
julia
cloud
would
not
hear
to
that
she
said
they
must
be
fair
even
to
a
college
and
luddington
would
want
them
to
look
the
place
over
thoroughly
while
they
were
there
so
after
breakfast
the
two
reluctant
young
people
went
with
julia
cloud
to
make
investigation
they
went
through
the
classrooms
and
the
chapel
and
the
library
and
gymnasiums
they
visited
the
science
halls
and
workshops
they
even
climbed
up
to
the
observatory
and
took
a
squint
at
the
big
telescope
and
then
they
came
down
and
went
with
a
dealer
to
see
some
houses
but
at
twelve
they
came
back
to
their
with
a
sigh
of
relief
ate
a
good
dinner
and
climbing
into
their
car
shook
the
dust
of
the
town
as
it
were
from
their
feet
it
may
be
a
very
nice
town
but
it
not
the
town
for
me
chanted
leslie
nestling
back
among
the
cushions
here
too
said
allison
letting
the
car
ride
out
under
full
power
over
the
smooth
country
road
but
though
julia
cloud
questioned
several
times
she
could
get
no
explanation
except
allison
terse
too
provincial
whatever
he
meant
by
that
she
doubted
whether
he
knew
himself
she
wondered
whether
it
were
that
they
each
felt
the
same
homesick
feeling
that
she
had
experienced
they
stayed
that
night
at
a
little
country
inn
and
started
on
their
way
again
at
early
morning
for
they
had
a
long
journey
before
them
to
reach
the
second
place
that
luddington
had
suggested
late
that
afternoon
they
stopped
in
a
small
city
and
decided
to
rest
until
morning
for
the
children
wanted
to
stretch
their
limbs
and
they
felt
that
their
aunt
was
very
weary
though
she
declared
she
was
only
sleepy
the
sun
had
quite
gone
down
the
next
evening
and
the
twilight
was
beginning
to
settle
over
everything
as
they
drove
at
last
into
the
second
college
town
of
their
tour
and
the
church
bells
were
pealing
for
prayer
meeting
church
bells
the
thought
of
them
sent
a
thrill
through
julia
cloud
heart
there
was
somehow
a
familiar
sound
to
them
that
made
her
think
of
the
prayer
meetings
that
had
cheered
her
heart
through
many
lonely
days
it
had
really
been
for
many
years
her
one
outing
to
go
to
prayer
meeting
even
after
her
mother
had
become
bedridden
she
had
always
insisted
on
julia
going
off
to
prayer
meeting
and
a
neighbor
who
was
lame
and
sometimes
stayed
with
her
would
come
hobbling
in
and
send
her
off
the
old
cracked
church
bell
at
home
had
always
sounded
sweet
to
her
ears
because
it
meant
that
this
hour
was
her
own
quiet
time
to
go
away
alone
and
rest
and
it
had
been
real
always
even
though
sometimes
the
meetings
themselves
had
been
wofully
prosy
there
had
always
been
the
pleasant
little
chat
and
the
warm
afterwards
and
then
the
going
home
again
beneath
the
stars
with
a
bit
of
the
last
hymn
in
one
soul
to
sing
one
to
sleep
with
nearer
my
god
to
thee
nearer
to
thee
though
it
be
a
cross
that
raiseth
me
and
the
burden
had
grown
less
and
her
heart
had
grown
light
with
the
promise
of
her
father
those
meetings
had
been
to
julia
cloud
very
real
meetings
with
her
christ
and
now
as
the
evening
bells
pealed
out
her
heart
leaped
to
meet
and
answer
the
call
oh
i
like
to
go
to
prayer
meeting
she
said
impulsively
as
they
passed
the
lighted
church
and
saw
a
few
faithful
going
in
at
the
door
do
you
mean
it
asked
allison
bringing
the
car
to
a
stop
do
you
it
cloudy
then
let
go
we
can
size
the
people
up
and
see
if
we
like
their
looks
i
guess
we
can
stand
a
prayer
meeting
unless
you
are
too
tired
with
the
eagerness
of
a
child
julia
cloud
got
out
of
the
car
and
went
into
the
house
of
the
lord
it
was
like
a
bit
of
heaven
to
her
she
did
realize
what
a
bore
it
might
be
to
her
two
companions
it
was
a
good
little
meeting
as
such
meetings
go
very
little
enthusiasm
very
few
present
mostly
elders
and
their
wives
with
an
old
saint
or
two
almost
at
the
journey
end
and
a
dignified
minister
who
said
some
good
things
in
a
drony
sleepy
tone
the
piano
was
played
by
a
homely
young
woman
who
wore
unfashionable
clothes
and
made
frightful
mistakes
in
the
bass
occasionally
but
that
did
not
seem
to
trouble
the
singers
who
sang
with
the
heart
rather
than
with
their
voices
allison
sat
solemnly
and
refrained
from
looking
at
his
sister
but
both
stole
occasional
glances
at
their
aunt
and
admired
her
new
clothes
and
the
beautiful
light
on
her
face
for
julia
cloud
felt
as
if
she
were
glimpsing
into
heaven
and
seeing
her
lord
in
this
bit
of
communion
with
some
of
his
saints
and
when
she
bowed
her
head
in
the
closing
prayer
she
was
thanking
him
for
all
his
mercies
in
bringing
this
wonderful
change
into
her
gray
life
and
giving
her
these
two
dear
children
to
love
her
and
be
loved
by
her
as
she
rose
to
come
out
her
face
was
glorified
by
that
vision
on
the
mount
the
minister
came
and
spoke
to
them
and
welcomed
them
to
the
church
although
allison
told
him
quite
curtly
that
they
were
only
passing
through
the
town
but
julia
cloud
trod
the
neat
brown
ingrain
carpet
of
the
aisle
as
if
it
were
golden
pavement
of
all
the
stupid
places
said
allison
as
they
got
into
the
car
what
do
they
have
prayer
meetings
for
anyway
did
you
manage
to
keep
awake
cloudy
and
suddenly
like
a
pall
there
fell
upon
julia
cloud
bright
soul
the
realization
that
these
children
did
not
would
not
feel
as
she
did
about
such
things
they
had
probably
never
been
taught
to
love
the
house
of
god
and
how
was
she
ever
to
make
them
see
perhaps
it
had
been
prosy
and
dull
to
one
who
did
not
hear
the
lord
voice
behind
the
bible
words
perhaps
the
old
minister
had
been
long
and
tiresome
and
the
children
were
weary
with
the
journey
and
sleepy
she
ought
not
to
have
let
them
stop
now
and
she
began
to
say
how
sorry
she
was
but
when
they
saw
from
her
words
that
she
had
really
enjoyed
that
dull
little
meeting
they
were
silent
well
cloudy
i
hand
it
to
you
said
allison
at
last
if
you
could
stand
that
meeting
and
enjoy
it
you
some
christian
but
glad
for
one
that
we
went
if
you
liked
it
and
i
guess
if
you
can
go
a
football
game
now
and
then
i
ought
to
be
able
to
stand
a
prayer
meeting
so
now
here
goes
for
seeing
the
town
it
only
nine
and
i
believe
that
the
college
up
there
on
the
hill
where
all
those
lights
are
shall
we
drive
up
there
the
car
slipped
through
the
pleasant
evening
streets
turning
a
corner
slowing
up
at
a
crossing
to
take
a
view
of
the
town
and
keeping
all
the
time
in
view
the
clusters
of
lights
on
the
hill
which
allison
conceived
to
be
the
college
suddenly
leslie
leaned
forward
and
cried
o
allison
stop
stop
there
it
is
just
there
on
the
right
and
for
sale
too
oh
let
get
right
out
and
get
the
name
of
the
agent
so
we
wo
lose
it
again
allison
stopped
the
car
suddenly
and
turned
to
look
there
in
the
full
blaze
of
an
electric
nestled
among
shrubbery
and
tall
trees
with
a
smooth
terrace
in
front
was
a
beautiful
little
cottage
of
white
stone
with
a
pink
roof
and
windows
everywhere
why
that
not
the
college
les
what
the
matter
with
you
said
allison
putting
his
hand
on
the
starter
again
better
wake
up
you
know
a
college
when
you
do
see
one
college
nothing
said
his
sister
that
our
house
that
our
allison
the
very
house
i
dreamed
of
it
looks
a
little
like
the
houses
in
california
and
it
is
the
very
thing
now
no
use
you
got
to
get
out
and
get
that
agent
name
or
i
jump
out
myself
and
get
lost
and
walk
the
rest
of
the
way
it
is
lovely
said
julia
cloud
leaning
over
to
look
but
it
looks
expensive
and
you
would
want
to
a
house
you
know
dear
for
you
might
not
stay
oh
yes
we
would
if
we
liked
it
and
besides
houses
can
be
sold
again
when
you
get
done
with
them
though
i
never
want
to
sell
that
it
a
perfect
little
duck
allison
will
you
get
out
or
shall
i
oh
i
game
said
allison
getting
out
and
jumping
the
hedge
into
the
pretty
yard
he
took
out
his
pencil
and
wrote
down
the
address
in
his
stepped
up
the
terrace
and
glanced
about
then
went
close
to
the
street
sign
and
found
out
what
corner
it
was
near
it
is
a
pippin
sure
thing
he
said
as
he
sprang
into
the
car
again
but
leslie
for
the
love
of
mike
do
find
any
more
houses
i
hungry
as
a
bear
that
prayer
meeting
was
one
too
many
for
me
i
going
to
make
for
the
nearest
restaurant
and
then
if
you
want
to
go
after
that
all
right
but
i
going
to
find
the
eats
first
they
asked
a
group
of
boys
where
the
restaurant
was
and
one
pointed
to
an
open
door
from
which
light
was
streaming
forth
there
the
they
said
and
the
party
descended
hungry
and
happy
with
the
delicious
uncertainty
of
having
found
a
dream
of
a
house
in
the
dark
and
wondering
what
it
would
turn
out
to
be
in
the
daytime
they
inquired
the
way
to
the
inn
and
decided
to
stop
further
investigations
until
morning
chapter
x
they
were
all
very
weary
and
slept
well
that
night
but
strange
to
say
allison
who
was
the
awoke
first
and
was
out
looking
the
town
over
before
the
others
had
thought
of
awaking
he
came
back
to
breakfast
eager
and
impatient
we
do
need
to
go
any
farther
he
declared
it
a
peach
of
a
place
there
a
creek
that
reaches
up
in
the
woods
for
miles
and
they
have
canoes
and
skating
and
a
and
there
are
everywhere
and
it
only
eleven
miles
from
the
city
i
say
we
just
camp
here
and
not
bother
about
going
on
to
the
other
place
i
satisfied
if
that
house
is
big
enough
it
just
the
thing
but
have
you
been
to
the
college
no
but
i
asked
about
it
they
have
intercollegiate
games
and
frats
and
i
guess
it
all
right
it
has
a
peach
of
a
campus
too
and
a
carnegie
library
with
chimes
well
but
dear
you
are
going
to
college
just
for
those
things
oh
the
college
be
all
right
guardy
would
have
suggested
it
if
it
was
but
we
go
up
there
this
morning
and
look
around
now
children
do
get
your
heart
set
on
it
before
you
know
all
about
it
you
know
that
house
may
be
quite
impossible
now
cloudy
put
in
leslie
you
know
allison
told
you
you
were
a
good
sport
you
must
begin
by
preaching
before
you
find
out
if
it
is
all
right
why
of
course
we
do
want
it
so
let
have
the
fun
of
thinking
it
is
till
we
prove
it
is
or
it
is
julia
cloud
looked
into
the
laughing
happy
eyes
and
yielded
with
a
smile
of
course
she
said
that
reasonable
i
agreed
to
that
but
there
one
thing
you
know
we
bound
to
go
on
to
the
other
college
because
luddington
expects
us
and
we
can
come
back
here
again
if
we
like
this
better
oh
we
can
wire
him
to
come
here
said
leslie
now
let
go
first
to
that
house
please
because
i
so
afraid
somebody
will
buy
it
before
we
get
the
option
on
it
i
heard
that
houses
are
very
scarce
in
the
east
just
now
and
people
are
snapping
them
up
i
read
that
on
the
back
of
that
old
man
paper
at
the
next
table
to
ours
this
morning
all
three
of
them
having
the
hearts
of
children
they
went
at
once
to
hunt
up
the
agent
before
ever
they
got
even
a
glimpse
of
the
halls
of
learning
standing
brave
and
fair
on
the
hillside
in
the
morning
sunshine
because
there
are
plenty
more
colleges
said
leslie
but
there
is
only
one
home
for
us
and
i
believe
we
found
it
if
it
looks
half
as
pretty
in
the
daylight
as
it
did
at
night
it
took
only
a
few
minutes
to
find
the
agent
and
get
the
key
of
the
house
and
presently
they
were
standing
on
the
terrace
gazing
with
delight
at
the
house
it
was
indeed
a
lovely
little
dwelling
it
was
built
of
stone
and
then
painted
white
but
the
roof
and
gables
were
tiled
with
great
pink
tiles
giving
an
odd
little
foreign
look
to
it
something
like
anne
hathaway
cottage
in
general
contour
leslie
declared
the
top
of
the
terrace
was
too
and
all
the
porches
were
paved
with
tiles
the
house
itself
seemed
filled
with
windows
all
around
allison
unlocked
the
door
and
they
exclaimed
with
pleasure
as
he
threw
it
wide
open
and
they
stepped
in
the
sunshine
was
flooding
the
great
from
every
direction
it
seemed
to
begin
with
the
room
was
very
large
and
gave
the
effect
of
being
a
because
of
its
white
panelled
walls
and
its
many
windows
straight
across
from
the
front
door
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
opened
a
small
hallway
or
passage
with
stairs
leading
up
to
a
platform
where
more
windows
shed
a
beautiful
light
down
the
stairs
on
walls
papered
with
strange
tropical
birds
in
delicate
tracery
to
the
right
through
a
wide
white
arch
from
the
was
a
charming
white
with
little
high
windows
over
the
spot
for
the
sideboard
and
long
windows
in
front
to
the
left
was
an
enormous
stone
fireplace
with
high
of
stone
and
the
chimney
above
the
was
wide
enough
for
an
old
yule
log
and
on
either
side
of
it
were
double
glass
doors
opening
into
a
long
porch
room
which
also
had
a
fireplace
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
chimney
and
was
completely
shut
in
by
long
casement
windows
there
were
four
large
bedrooms
and
a
little
hall
room
that
could
be
used
for
a
or
den
or
an
extra
bedroom
besides
a
neat
little
maid
room
in
a
notch
on
the
landing
and
two
bathrooms
and
delightful
tucked
away
in
between
things
then
leslie
opened
a
glass
door
in
the
very
prettiest
room
of
all
which
she
and
allison
immediately
decided
must
belong
to
their
aunt
and
exclaimed
in
delight
for
here
nestled
between
the
gables
with
a
tiled
wall
all
about
it
was
a
delightful
housetop
or
uncovered
porch
so
situated
among
the
trees
that
it
was
entirely
shut
in
from
the
world
it
was
perfect
they
stood
and
looked
at
one
another
in
delight
and
for
the
time
the
college
was
forgotten
then
allison
dashed
away
and
came
back
eagerly
almost
immediately
there
a
garage
he
said
just
behind
the
kitchen
a
regular
robin
nest
of
a
one
white
with
pink
tiles
just
like
the
house
and
a
pebbled
drive
say
it
must
be
some
fool
of
a
guy
that
would
sell
this
is
it
just
a
crackerjack
my
dear
put
in
julia
cloud
it
ca
help
being
very
expensive
now
cloudy
remember
said
leslie
holding
up
her
finger
in
mock
rebuke
just
wait
and
see
and
anyhow
you
do
know
guardy
lud
if
he
could
see
us
located
in
a
peach
of
a
home
like
this
he
go
back
to
his
growley
old
dear
of
a
wife
with
happy
tears
rolling
down
his
nice
old
cheeks
allison
you
go
talk
to
that
agent
and
you
give
him
a
hundred
dollars
if
you
got
it
left
here
i
guess
i
got
some
too
just
to
bind
the
bargain
till
guardy
gets
here
and
say
you
go
see
if
you
ca
get
guardy
on
the
i
do
want
to
go
a
step
farther
could
you
be
happy
here
cloudy
with
that
fireplace
and
that
prayer
meeting
to
go
to
i
would
mind
going
with
you
sometimes
when
i
did
have
to
study
julia
cloud
stooped
and
kissed
the
eager
face
and
whispered
very
happy
darling
and
then
they
went
to
the
agent
again
and
the
telephone
guardy
lud
proved
himself
quite
equal
to
the
occasion
by
agreeing
to
come
on
at
once
and
approve
their
choice
and
promised
to
be
there
before
evening
i
knew
he
would
said
leslie
happily
as
they
seated
themselves
in
the
car
again
for
the
pleasant
run
to
the
college
they
found
the
dean
in
his
office
and
allison
was
taken
with
him
at
once
he
is
much
like
that
musty
little
guy
in
the
other
college
he
looked
like
a
wet
hen
growled
allison
in
a
low
tone
to
his
sister
and
aunt
while
the
dean
was
out
in
the
hall
talking
to
a
student
i
like
him
do
you
and
julia
cloud
sat
wondering
what
the
boy
standards
could
be
that
he
could
judge
so
suddenly
and
enthusiastically
yet
she
had
to
admit
herself
that
she
liked
this
man
tall
and
grave
with
a
pleasant
twinkle
hidden
away
in
his
eyes
and
around
the
corners
of
his
firm
mouth
she
felt
satisfied
that
here
was
a
man
who
would
be
both
wise
and
just
they
made
the
rounds
of
the
college
buildings
and
campus
with
growing
enthusiasm
and
then
drove
back
to
the
inn
to
lunch
with
hearty
appetites
let
go
down
to
the
house
and
measure
things
and
look
around
once
more
proposed
leslie
then
we
can
come
back
and
wait
here
for
guardy
we
must
be
away
when
he
arrives
for
he
want
to
get
everything
fixed
up
and
get
away
i
know
him
allison
did
you
get
a
allison
produced
one
from
his
and
they
studied
the
trains
and
decided
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
the
arrival
of
their
guardian
until
three
and
probably
not
until
five
that
all
right
said
leslie
cloudy
and
i
stay
here
from
three
to
five
and
you
can
meet
the
trains
but
first
i
want
the
dimensions
of
those
rooms
so
cloudy
and
i
can
plan
we
got
a
whole
lot
to
do
before
college
opens
and
we
ca
spare
a
minute
o
cloudy
i
so
happy
is
that
house
just
a
duck
they
went
to
the
village
store
bought
a
a
yardstick
and
a
and
repaired
to
the
house
allison
took
the
by
masculine
right
julia
cloud
said
she
felt
more
at
home
with
the
and
leslie
preferred
the
yardstick
with
pencil
and
paper
they
went
to
work
making
a
diagram
of
each
room
with
spaces
between
windows
and
doors
for
furniture
taking
it
room
by
room
we
got
to
know
about
length
of
curtains
and
whether
furniture
will
fit
in
declared
leslie
wisely
i
thought
it
all
out
nights
in
the
sleeper
on
the
way
over
here
just
think
is
it
going
to
be
fun
furnishing
the
whole
house
you
know
cloudy
i
did
have
hardly
anything
sent
because
it
really
was
worth
while
we
sort
of
wanted
to
leave
the
house
at
home
just
as
it
was
when
mamma
was
living
to
come
back
to
sometimes
and
so
we
let
it
to
an
old
gentleman
a
friend
of
grandfather
and
guardy
who
has
only
himself
and
his
wife
and
servants
and
will
take
beautiful
care
of
it
but
i
went
around
and
picked
out
anything
i
wanted
rugs
and
pictures
and
some
and
a
few
bits
of
old
mahogany
that
i
love
just
small
things
that
would
pack
easily
guardy
said
we
might
buy
our
own
things
he
set
a
limit
on
our
spending
of
course
but
he
said
it
would
be
good
experience
for
us
to
learn
how
to
buy
wisely
inside
a
certain
sum
julia
cloud
went
around
like
one
in
a
dream
with
her
new
setting
down
careful
figures
and
feeling
like
a
child
playing
dolls
again
it
was
almost
three
when
they
finally
finished
their
measurements
and
allison
hurried
them
back
to
the
inn
and
repaired
to
the
station
to
meet
trains
leslie
made
her
aunt
lie
down
on
the
bed
supposedly
for
a
nap
but
no
one
could
have
taken
a
nap
even
if
he
had
wanted
to
which
julia
cloud
did
not
with
an
eager
excited
girl
sitting
beside
the
bed
just
fluttering
with
ideas
about
couches
and
pillows
and
furniture
and
curtains
we
have
a
great
deep
couch
with
on
the
seat
and
back
and
put
it
in
the
middle
of
the
facing
the
fireplace
wo
we
cloudy
and
what
color
do
you
think
would
be
pretty
for
the
cushions
i
guess
blue
deep
brocaded
velvet
or
something
soft
that
will
tone
well
with
the
mahogany
woodwork
i
love
mahogany
in
a
white
room
do
you
cloudy
and
i
had
a
great
big
blue
chinese
rug
sent
over
that
i
think
will
do
nicely
for
there
you
like
blue
do
you
cloudy
she
finished
anxiously
because
i
want
to
have
you
like
it
more
even
than
we
do
oh
i
love
it
gasped
julia
cloud
trying
to
set
her
mind
to
revel
in
extravagant
desires
without
compunction
she
was
not
used
to
considering
life
in
terms
of
chinese
rugs
or
mahogany
and
brocade
velvet
i
like
the
curtains
next
the
windows
to
be
all
alike
all
over
the
house
would
you
just
sheer
soft
creamy
white
and
then
inner
curtains
of
chinese
silk
or
something
like
that
we
want
blue
in
the
of
course
if
we
had
the
blue
rugs
and
couch
and
oh
old
rose
i
guess
in
the
or
perhaps
mahogany
color
or
tan
green
for
that
room
that
it
and
lots
of
willow
chairs
and
tables
and
rush
mats
on
the
tiled
floor
oh
are
we
having
fun
cloudy
dear
now
i
write
out
a
list
of
things
we
have
to
buy
while
you
take
a
nap
and
so
it
went
on
the
whole
afternoon
until
the
sound
of
a
distant
whistle
warned
them
that
the
train
was
coming
in
and
they
must
be
prepared
to
meet
luddington
according
to
programme
they
hurried
into
their
wraps
and
went
down
to
the
piazza
to
wait
for
the
car
none
too
soon
for
allison
was
already
driving
around
the
curve
in
front
of
the
door
and
luddington
sat
beside
him
radiating
satisfaction
anything
that
pleased
his
adorable
wards
pleased
him
but
this
especially
so
for
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
respond
to
the
many
telegrams
summoning
him
home
to
california
and
the
quicker
this
little
household
was
settled
the
sooner
he
might
leave
them
they
drove
at
once
of
course
to
the
house
allison
and
leslie
talking
fast
and
eagerly
every
minute
of
the
way
their
eyes
bright
and
their
faces
beautiful
with
enthusiasm
and
luddington
could
only
sit
and
listen
and
smile
over
their
heads
at
julia
cloud
who
was
smiling
also
and
who
in
her
new
silvery
garments
looked
to
him
all
the
more
a
lady
and
fit
to
play
mother
to
his
wards
well
now
now
now
said
guardy
lud
after
they
had
gone
carefully
over
every
room
and
were
coming
again
this
is
great
this
certainly
is
great
i
could
have
had
it
better
if
i
made
it
to
order
could
i
and
i
certainly
wish
you
were
settled
here
and
i
could
stay
long
enough
to
take
breakfast
with
you
and
enjoy
some
more
of
your
excellent
buckwheat
cakes
miss
cloud
he
turned
with
a
gallant
bow
to
julia
i
hope
you
teach
my
little
girl
here
to
bake
them
just
like
that
so
she
can
make
me
some
when
she
comes
back
to
california
to
visit
us
again
they
rode
him
around
the
town
through
the
college
grounds
and
then
back
to
the
inn
for
dinner
that
evening
they
spent
in
discussion
and
business
plans
for
the
winter
the
next
morning
they
took
luddington
up
to
the
college
where
he
made
final
arrangements
for
the
young
people
to
be
entered
as
students
and
afterwards
drove
to
the
city
luddington
had
one
or
two
friends
there
to
whom
he
wished
to
introduce
them
that
they
might
have
some
one
near
at
hand
to
call
upon
in
a
time
of
need
he
also
took
them
all
to
a
bank
and
arranged
their
bank
accounts
so
that
they
might
draw
what
they
needed
at
any
time
after
lunch
he
went
with
them
to
several
of
the
largest
stores
and
opened
a
charge
account
for
them
then
with
a
warm
for
julia
cloud
and
an
emotional
for
the
young
people
he
left
them
to
rush
for
his
train
we
might
stay
in
town
and
be
ready
to
shop
early
in
the
morning
proposed
leslie
no
said
allison
decidedly
cloudy
looks
worn
to
a
frazzle
and
sick
to
death
of
the
city
let
beat
it
back
to
where
they
have
good
air
we
can
go
right
to
bed
after
dinner
and
get
up
good
and
early
and
be
here
as
soon
as
the
stores
are
open
they
do
open
till
nine
i
saw
the
signs
on
the
doors
everywhere
so
back
they
went
for
a
good
night
rest
and
were
up
and
at
it
early
in
the
morning
scarcely
noticing
the
way
they
rode
so
interested
were
they
in
deciding
how
many
chairs
and
beds
and
tables
they
needed
to
buy
let
get
the
curtains
first
and
then
we
can
have
the
windows
washed
and
put
them
right
up
said
leslie
and
nobody
can
see
in
i
crazy
to
be
shut
into
our
own
house
and
feel
that
it
belongs
to
us
we
can
select
them
while
allison
gone
to
see
what
the
matter
with
his
engine
but
when
julia
cloud
heard
the
stupendous
price
that
was
asked
for
curtains
or
curtains
made
to
order
with
fixtures
and
installation
she
exclaimed
in
horror
leslie
this
is
foolish
we
can
easily
make
them
ourselves
and
put
them
up
for
less
than
half
the
price
if
i
had
only
brought
my
but
it
was
all
out
of
repair
could
we
really
make
them
ourselves
cloudy
would
that
be
fun
we
get
a
of
course
we
need
it
for
other
things
too
sometimes
wo
we
of
course
we
get
one
we
buy
that
next
now
how
many
yards
of
each
of
these
do
we
need
in
a
few
minutes
the
salesman
had
figured
out
how
much
was
needed
counted
the
number
of
fixtures
for
doorways
and
windows
and
arranged
to
send
the
package
down
to
the
car
at
a
certain
time
later
in
the
morning
then
they
went
at
once
and
bought
a
one
that
julia
cloud
knew
all
about
and
said
was
the
best
and
lightest
on
the
market
leslie
was
as
pleased
with
the
idea
of
learning
to
run
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
new
toy
and
she
a
child
we
have
it
sent
right
to
the
little
new
house
and
then
we
can
go
there
evenings
after
we
are
through
shopping
and
sew
you
can
cut
and
i
can
put
in
the
hems
if
you
think
i
can
do
them
well
enough
we
must
get
scissors
and
thread
a
lot
of
it
and
silk
to
match
the
colored
curtains
too
they
took
the
rooms
one
at
a
time
and
furnished
them
allison
joining
them
and
taking
as
much
interest
in
the
design
of
the
furniture
as
if
he
had
been
a
young
bridegroom
just
setting
up
housekeeping
for
himself
they
had
set
aside
a
certain
sum
for
each
room
so
that
they
would
not
overstep
their
guardian
limit
and
with
julia
cloud
to
put
on
the
brakes
and
suggest
simplicity
and
decide
what
was
in
good
taste
for
such
a
small
village
house
they
easily
came
within
the
generous
limit
allowed
them
it
was
a
great
game
for
julia
cloud
to
come
out
of
her
simple
country
life
and
plunge
into
this
wholesale
beautiful
buying
untroubled
by
a
continual
feeling
that
she
must
select
the
very
cheapest
without
regard
to
taste
or
desire
it
was
wonderful
but
it
was
wearying
in
spite
of
the
delight
and
so
the
little
house
was
not
all
furnished
in
a
day
well
the
done
anyway
and
the
willow
set
for
the
porch
room
sighed
leslie
leaning
back
with
a
fling
of
weariness
now
we
do
the
sunday
les
the
stores
are
open
use
your
bean
a
little
child
sunday
leslie
beautiful
face
drew
itself
into
a
snarl
of
impatience
the
first
really
that
julia
cloud
had
seen
oh
darn
said
leslie
pretty
lips
is
that
too
horrid
i
forgot
all
about
it
i
wonder
what
they
have
to
have
sunday
for
anyway
it
just
a
dull
old
bore
o
leslie
darling
said
julia
cloud
aghast
something
in
her
heart
growing
suddenly
heavy
and
sinking
her
down
down
so
that
she
felt
as
if
she
could
hardly
hold
her
head
up
another
minute
well
cloudy
dear
do
you
think
it
a
bore
yourself
truly
come
now
own
up
and
i
sure
i
do
see
what
the
use
of
it
do
you
one
ca
do
a
thing
that
nice
but
i
tell
you
what
we
can
do
her
eyes
growing
bright
with
eagerness
again
we
measure
and
cut
all
the
curtains
and
turn
the
hems
up
and
allison
you
can
put
up
the
fixtures
if
only
the
machine
could
have
been
sent
up
we
could
have
had
the
curtains
all
done
could
we
cloudy
but
julia
cloud
lips
were
white
and
trembling
and
her
sweet
eyes
had
suddenly
gone
dark
with
trouble
and
apprehension
o
leslie
darling
child
she
gasped
again
you
do
mean
you
would
work
on
the
sabbath
day
why
why
not
cloudy
dear
is
there
anything
wrong
about
that
chapter
xi
julia
cloud
had
a
sudden
feeling
that
everything
was
whirling
beneath
her
the
very
foundations
of
the
earth
she
drew
a
deep
breath
and
tried
to
steady
herself
thinking
in
her
heart
that
she
must
be
very
calm
and
not
make
any
mistakes
in
this
great
crisis
that
had
arisen
it
flashed
across
her
consciousness
that
she
was
a
simple
woman
accustomed
to
ideas
living
all
her
life
in
a
little
town
where
the
line
between
the
church
and
the
world
was
strongly
marked
where
the
traditions
of
christianity
were
still
held
sacred
in
the
hearts
of
many
and
where
the
customs
of
worldliness
had
not
yet
noticeably
invaded
all
the
articles
she
had
read
in
the
religious
press
about
the
worldliness
of
the
modern
sabbath
the
terrible
desecration
of
the
day
that
had
been
dear
and
sacred
to
her
all
her
life
as
being
the
time
when
she
came
closest
to
her
lord
all
the
struggle
between
the
church
and
the
world
to
keep
the
old
laws
rigidly
and
all
the
sneers
she
had
seen
in
the
secular
press
against
the
fanatics
who
were
trying
to
force
the
world
back
to
puritanism
came
shivering
to
her
mind
in
one
great
thrill
of
agony
as
she
recognized
that
she
was
face
to
face
with
one
of
the
biggest
religious
problems
of
the
day
and
must
fight
it
out
alone
the
beautiful
life
that
had
seemed
to
be
opening
out
before
her
was
not
then
to
be
all
beauty
behind
the
flowers
of
this
new
eden
there
hid
a
serpent
of
temptation
and
she
julia
cloud
disciple
of
the
lord
christ
was
to
be
tried
out
to
see
what
faith
there
was
in
her
for
a
moment
she
faltered
and
closed
her
eyes
shuddering
how
could
she
face
it
she
who
knew
so
little
what
to
say
and
how
to
tell
her
quiet
why
had
she
been
placed
in
such
a
position
why
was
there
not
some
one
wiser
than
she
to
guide
the
feet
of
these
children
into
the
straight
and
narrow
way
but
only
a
moment
she
shrank
thus
the
voice
of
her
master
seemed
to
speak
in
her
heart
as
the
wind
whirled
by
the
car
and
stirred
the
loose
hair
on
her
forehead
the
voice
that
had
been
her
guide
through
life
was
requiring
her
now
to
witness
to
these
two
whom
she
loved
as
no
other
could
do
it
be
they
ever
so
wise
just
because
she
loved
them
and
loved
him
and
was
not
pretending
to
be
wise
only
following
then
she
drew
a
deep
breath
reminded
herself
once
more
that
she
must
be
careful
not
to
antagonize
and
sat
up
gravely
dear
it
is
god
day
and
i
have
always
felt
that
he
wanted
us
to
make
it
holy
for
him
keep
worldly
things
out
of
it
you
know
i
would
feel
that
i
could
work
on
that
day
of
course
i
have
no
right
to
say
you
shall
not
i
only
your
adviser
and
friend
you
know
but
i
rather
you
would
because
i
know
god
would
rather
you
would
leslie
pouted
uneasily
how
in
the
world
could
you
know
that
she
said
almost
crossly
she
did
love
to
carry
out
her
projects
and
hitherto
julia
cloud
had
put
no
hindrance
in
her
way
why
he
said
so
in
his
book
he
said
shalt
not
do
any
work
thou
nor
thy
son
nor
thy
daughter
oh
those
are
the
old
commandments
cloudy
dear
and
i
heard
people
even
ministers
say
that
they
are
out
of
date
now
they
have
anything
to
do
with
us
nowadays
julia
cloud
looked
still
graver
god
does
change
leslie
he
is
the
same
yesterday
and
and
forever
and
he
said
that
whoever
took
away
from
the
meaning
of
the
words
of
his
book
would
have
some
terrible
punishment
so
that
it
were
better
that
a
millstone
were
hanged
about
his
neck
and
that
he
were
drowned
well
i
think
he
be
a
perfectly
horrid
god
to
do
that
said
leslie
i
ca
see
how
you
can
believe
any
such
old
thing
it
like
you
cloudy
dear
it
just
some
old
thing
you
were
taught
you
do
like
to
be
and
unhappy
one
day
in
the
week
you
know
you
do
unhappy
why
dear
child
god
does
want
the
sabbath
to
be
that
he
wants
it
to
be
the
happiest
day
of
all
the
week
i
never
unhappy
on
sunday
i
like
it
best
of
all
suddenly
allison
turned
around
and
looked
at
julia
cloud
saw
the
white
strained
look
around
her
lips
the
yearning
light
in
her
eyes
and
had
some
swift
man
intuition
about
the
true
woman
soul
of
her
for
men
especially
young
men
do
have
these
intuitions
sometimes
as
well
as
women
leslie
he
said
gently
as
if
he
had
suddenly
grown
much
older
than
his
sister
ca
you
see
you
hurting
cloudy
cut
it
out
if
cloudy
likes
sunday
she
shall
have
it
the
way
she
wants
it
leslie
turned
with
sudden
compunction
o
cloudy
dear
i
did
mean
to
hurt
you
indeed
i
did
i
never
thought
you
care
it
all
right
dear
said
julia
cloud
with
her
gentle
voice
and
just
the
least
mite
of
a
gasp
you
see
i
sunday
has
been
always
very
dear
to
me
i
had
realized
you
would
feel
the
same
she
seemed
to
shrink
into
herself
and
though
the
smile
still
trembled
on
her
lips
there
was
a
hovering
of
distress
over
her
fine
brows
we
feel
the
same
declared
allison
if
you
feel
that
way
so
much
we
manage
somehow
to
be
loyal
to
what
you
think
you
always
do
it
for
us
and
if
we
ca
be
as
big
as
you
are
we
have
got
the
gang
spirit
it
teamwork
leslie
cloudy
goes
to
football
games
and
makes
fudge
for
our
friends
and
we
go
to
church
and
help
her
keep
sunday
her
way
see
why
of
course
sure
said
leslie
half
bewildered
i
did
mean
not
to
of
course
if
cloudy
likes
such
things
only
she
have
to
teach
me
how
for
i
never
did
like
those
things
well
i
say
let
get
cloudy
to
spend
the
first
sunday
telling
us
how
she
thinks
sunday
ought
to
be
kept
and
why
is
that
a
bargain
cloudy
but
i
afraid
i
would
be
wise
enough
to
explain
faltered
julia
cloud
distress
in
her
voice
i
could
maybe
find
something
to
read
to
you
about
it
oh
preserve
us
cloudy
we
do
want
any
old
dissertations
out
of
a
book
if
we
ca
have
your
own
thoughts
that
make
you
live
it
the
way
you
do
we
have
any
use
for
any
of
it
see
julia
cloud
forced
a
trembling
little
smile
and
said
she
saw
and
would
do
her
best
but
her
heart
sank
at
the
prospect
what
a
responsibility
to
be
put
upon
her
ignorant
shoulders
the
sabbath
in
her
bungling
hands
to
make
or
to
mar
for
these
two
young
souls
she
must
pray
oh
she
must
pray
continually
that
she
might
be
led
and
then
there
came
swiftly
to
her
mind
one
of
the
verses
that
had
become
dear
and
familiar
to
her
through
the
years
as
she
read
and
reread
her
bible
and
when
they
bring
you
unto
the
synagogues
and
unto
magistrates
and
powers
take
ye
no
thought
how
or
what
thing
ye
shall
answer
or
what
ye
shall
say
for
the
holy
ghost
shall
teach
you
in
the
same
hour
what
ye
ought
to
say
this
was
not
exactly
being
brought
before
magistrates
but
it
was
being
challenged
for
a
reason
for
the
hope
that
was
in
her
and
perhaps
she
could
claim
the
promise
surely
if
the
lord
wanted
her
to
defend
his
sabbath
before
these
two
he
would
give
her
wise
words
in
which
to
speak
anyhow
she
would
just
have
to
trust
him
for
she
had
none
of
her
own
now
see
what
you
done
leslie
said
her
brother
sharply
cloudy
has
looked
that
way
once
before
next
thing
you
know
she
be
washing
her
hands
of
us
and
running
off
back
to
sterling
again
o
cloudy
said
the
penitent
leslie
flinging
herself
into
her
arms
and
nestling
there
beseechingly
you
would
do
that
would
you
cloudy
dear
no
matter
how
naughty
i
got
because
you
would
know
i
would
mean
it
ever
even
if
i
was
real
bad
no
dear
said
julia
cloud
kissing
her
fair
forehead
but
this
is
just
one
of
those
things
that
i
meant
when
i
was
afraid
to
undertake
it
you
see
there
may
be
a
great
many
things
you
will
want
to
do
on
sunday
that
i
would
not
feel
it
right
for
me
to
do
and
i
may
be
a
hindrance
to
you
in
lots
of
ways
i
should
like
to
get
to
be
a
sort
of
burden
to
you
and
it
is
as
if
they
were
things
that
i
could
give
up
you
know
this
is
a
matter
of
conscience
that
all
right
cloudy
put
in
allison
you
have
your
say
in
things
like
that
we
are
so
selfish
as
all
that
and
besides
if
it
wrong
for
you
who
knows
but
it
wrong
for
us
too
we
look
into
it
julia
cloud
went
smiling
through
the
rest
of
the
evening
but
underneath
was
a
tugging
of
strange
dread
and
fear
at
her
heart
it
was
all
so
new
this
having
responsibility
with
souls
she
had
always
so
quietly
trusted
her
bible
and
tried
to
follow
her
lord
she
had
never
had
to
guide
others
there
had
not
been
time
for
her
even
to
take
a
class
in
sunday
school
and
she
knew
her
religion
only
as
it
applied
to
her
one
little
narrow
life
she
thought
not
realizing
that
when
one
has
applied
a
great
faith
to
the
circumstances
of
even
a
narrow
life
and
applied
it
thoroughly
through
a
lifetime
one
has
learned
more
theology
than
one
could
get
in
years
of
a
theological
seminary
theories
after
all
are
worth
little
unless
they
have
been
worked
out
in
experience
and
when
one
has
patiently
even
happily
given
up
much
of
the
joy
of
living
to
serve
has
learned
to
keep
self
under
and
love
even
the
unlovable
has
put
to
the
test
the
promises
of
the
bible
and
found
them
hold
true
in
time
of
need
and
has
found
the
sabbath
day
an
oasis
in
the
desert
of
an
otherwise
dreary
life
even
an
old
theologian
would
have
much
more
to
go
on
in
beginning
a
discussion
on
quite
early
the
next
morning
before
leslie
had
awakened
julia
cloud
had
slipped
softly
to
her
knees
by
the
bedside
and
was
communing
with
her
heavenly
father
concerning
her
need
of
guidance
when
leslie
awoke
her
aunt
was
sitting
by
the
window
with
her
bible
on
her
knee
and
a
sweet
look
of
peace
on
her
face
the
morning
sunlight
resting
on
the
silvery
whiteness
of
her
hair
like
a
benediction
it
was
perhaps
the
soft
turning
of
a
leaf
that
brought
the
girl
to
wakefulness
and
she
lay
for
some
time
quietly
watching
her
aunt
and
thinking
the
deep
thoughts
of
youth
perhaps
nothing
could
have
so
well
prepared
her
for
the
afternoon
talk
as
that
few
minutes
of
watching
julia
cloud
face
as
she
read
her
bible
glancing
now
and
then
from
the
window
thoughtfully
as
if
considering
something
she
had
read
julia
cloud
was
reading
over
everything
that
her
bible
said
about
the
sabbath
and
with
the
help
of
her
concordance
she
was
being
led
through
a
very
logical
train
of
thought
although
she
did
not
know
it
if
you
had
asked
her
she
would
have
said
that
she
had
not
been
thinking
about
what
she
would
say
to
the
children
she
had
been
deep
in
the
meaning
that
god
sent
to
her
own
soul
but
when
leslie
finally
stirred
and
greeted
her
julia
cloud
looked
up
with
a
smile
of
peace
and
there
was
no
longer
a
little
line
of
worry
between
her
straight
brows
the
peace
lasted
all
through
the
morning
and
went
with
her
down
to
breakfast
and
something
of
her
enjoyment
of
the
day
seemed
to
pervade
the
atmosphere
about
her
and
extend
to
the
two
young
people
they
hovered
about
her
anxious
to
please
and
a
trifle
ill
at
ease
at
first
lest
they
should
make
some
mistake
about
this
day
that
seemed
so
holy
to
their
aunt
and
had
always
been
to
them
nothing
but
a
bore
to
get
through
with
in
the
jolliest
way
possible
there
was
no
question
about
going
to
church
they
just
went
leslie
and
allison
had
never
made
a
practice
of
doing
so
since
they
had
been
left
to
themselves
it
had
not
been
necessary
in
the
circle
in
which
they
moved
when
they
went
to
school
and
had
to
go
to
church
they
evaded
the
rule
as
often
as
possible
but
somehow
they
felt
without
being
told
that
if
they
tried
to
remain
away
now
it
would
hurt
their
aunt
more
than
anything
else
they
could
do
and
while
they
were
usually
outspoken
and
frank
they
both
felt
that
here
was
a
time
to
be
silent
about
their
habits
we
going
to
church
said
allison
in
a
low
tone
as
he
drew
his
sister
chair
away
from
the
his
tone
had
the
quality
of
command
of
course
responded
leslie
quietly
it
was
so
that
julia
cloud
was
spared
the
knowledge
that
her
two
dear
young
people
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
attend
church
every
sabbath
and
her
peace
was
not
disturbed
the
sermon
in
the
little
stucco
church
where
they
had
gone
to
prayer
meeting
that
first
night
was
not
exceedingly
enlivening
nor
uplifting
the
minister
was
prosy
with
dignity
soaring
into
occasional
flights
of
eloquence
that
reminded
one
of
a
generation
ago
there
was
nothing
about
it
to
bring
to
mind
the
sweetness
of
a
sabbath
communion
with
christ
nothing
to
remind
a
young
soul
that
christ
was
ready
to
be
friend
and
saviour
it
was
rather
a
dissertation
on
one
of
the
epistles
with
a
smack
of
modern
higher
criticism
the
young
people
watched
the
preacher
a
while
listlessly
and
wished
for
the
end
but
a
glance
at
the
quiet
worshipful
face
of
their
aunt
kept
them
thoughtful
julia
cloud
evidently
had
something
that
most
other
people
did
not
have
they
said
to
themselves
some
inner
light
that
shone
through
her
face
some
finer
sight
and
keener
ear
that
made
her
see
and
hear
what
was
not
given
to
common
mortals
to
comprehend
and
because
she
sat
thus
with
the
light
of
communion
on
her
face
they
too
sat
with
respectful
hearts
and
tried
to
join
lustily
in
the
hymns
with
their
fresh
voices
the
minister
came
down
and
shook
hands
with
them
welcoming
them
kindly
he
seemed
more
human
out
of
the
pulpit
and
asked
quite
interestedly
where
they
were
to
live
and
whether
he
might
call
he
mentioned
sunday
school
and
christian
endeavor
and
said
he
hoped
they
would
cast
in
their
lot
among
them
and
the
young
people
gave
him
cold
little
smiles
and
withdrew
into
themselves
while
their
aunt
did
the
talking
they
were
willing
she
should
have
her
sabbath
and
they
would
do
all
in
their
power
to
make
it
what
she
wanted
but
they
were
hostile
toward
this
church
and
this
minister
and
all
that
it
had
to
do
with
it
simply
did
not
interest
them
julia
cloud
saw
this
in
their
eyes
as
she
turned
to
go
away
and
sighed
softly
to
herself
how
much
there
was
to
teach
them
could
she
ever
hope
to
make
them
feel
differently
in
two
short
weeks
the
college
would
open
and
they
would
be
swept
away
on
a
whirl
of
work
and
play
and
new
friends
and
functions
was
she
strong
enough
to
stem
the
tide
of
worldliness
that
would
ingulf
them
no
not
of
herself
but
she
had
read
that
very
morning
the
promises
of
her
lord
surely
i
will
be
with
thee
i
will
help
thee
and
she
meant
to
lay
hold
on
them
closely
she
could
do
nothing
of
herself
but
she
with
her
lord
helping
could
do
anything
he
wanted
done
that
was
enough
leslie
turned
longing
eyes
toward
the
winding
creek
and
an
alluring
canoe
that
lolled
idly
at
the
bank
down
below
the
inn
as
she
stood
on
the
piazza
after
dinner
waiting
for
her
aunt
but
allison
saw
her
glance
and
shook
his
head
better
not
suggest
it
he
said
there
are
a
lot
of
picnickers
down
there
carrying
on
high
she
would
not
like
it
i
sure
if
it
were
all
quiet
and
no
one
about
it
would
be
different
well
there
are
a
lot
of
people
around
here
on
the
piazzas
said
leslie
disconsolately
i
do
see
the
difference
but
when
julia
cloud
came
with
her
bible
slipped
unobtrusively
under
her
arm
she
suggested
a
quiet
spot
in
the
woods
and
so
they
wandered
off
through
the
trees
with
a
big
blanket
from
the
car
to
sit
on
and
found
a
wonderful
place
high
above
the
water
where
a
great
rift
of
rocks
jutted
out
among
drooping
hemlocks
and
was
carpeted
with
it
would
please
me
very
much
said
julia
cloud
as
she
sat
down
on
the
blanket
and
opened
her
bible
looking
up
wistfully
at
the
two
if
you
two
would
go
to
that
christian
endeavor
meeting
i
hate
to
ask
you
to
do
anything
like
that
right
away
but
that
minister
begged
me
to
get
you
to
come
he
said
they
were
having
such
a
struggle
to
make
it
live
and
that
they
needed
some
fresh
young
workers
he
asked
me
if
you
did
sing
and
he
said
singers
were
very
much
needed
there
was
a
heavy
silence
for
a
moment
while
the
two
young
things
looked
at
each
other
aghast
across
her
and
julia
cloud
kept
her
eyes
on
the
floating
clouds
above
the
hemlocks
she
still
had
that
softened
look
of
being
within
a
safe
shelter
where
storms
and
troubles
could
not
really
trouble
her
yet
there
was
a
dear
eager
look
in
her
eyes
both
children
saw
it
and
with
wonderful
intuition
interpreted
it
and
because
their
hearts
were
young
and
tender
they
yielded
to
its
influence
leslie
swooped
down
upon
her
aunt
with
an
overwhelming
kiss
and
allison
dropped
down
beside
her
with
a
sure
we
go
cloudy
if
that
will
do
you
any
good
i
ca
say
i
keen
about
pleasing
that
stiff
old
parson
guy
but
anything
want
is
different
i
know
just
what
you
letting
us
in
for
but
i
guess
we
can
stand
most
anything
once
julia
cloud
put
out
a
hand
to
grasp
a
hand
of
each
and
looking
up
they
saw
that
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
are
those
happy
tears
cloudy
or
the
other
kind
tell
us
quick
or
we
jump
in
the
creek
and
drown
ourselves
laughed
leslie
and
then
two
white
handkerchiefs
one
big
and
one
little
came
swiftly
out
and
dabbed
at
her
cheeks
until
there
was
a
sign
of
a
tear
to
be
seen
i
think
i
almost
too
happy
to
talk
said
julia
cloud
resting
back
against
the
tree
and
looking
up
into
its
lacy
green
branches
it
seems
as
if
i
was
just
beginning
my
life
over
and
being
a
child
again
for
a
few
minutes
they
sat
so
looking
up
into
the
changing
autumn
sky
listening
to
the
soft
tinkle
of
the
water
running
below
the
dip
of
an
oar
the
swirl
of
a
blue
heron
wing
as
it
clove
the
air
the
distant
voices
of
the
picnickers
farther
down
the
creek
the
rustle
of
the
yellow
as
they
whispered
of
the
time
to
go
and
how
they
would
drift
down
like
little
brown
boats
to
the
stream
and
glide
away
to
the
end
now
and
then
a
nut
would
fall
with
a
tiny
crisp
thud
and
a
squirrel
would
whisk
from
a
limb
overhead
they
were
very
quiet
and
let
the
beauty
of
the
spot
sink
deep
into
their
souls
then
at
last
julia
cloud
took
up
her
bible
and
began
to
talk
chapter
xii
there
were
tiny
slips
of
paper
in
julia
cloud
bible
and
she
turned
to
the
first
one
shyly
it
was
such
new
work
to
her
to
be
talking
about
these
things
to
any
but
her
own
worshipful
soul
the
two
young
people
settled
back
in
comfortable
attitudes
on
the
blanket
and
put
their
gaze
upon
the
far
sky
overhead
they
were
embarrassed
also
but
they
meant
to
carry
this
thing
through
thus
the
heavens
and
the
earth
were
finished
and
all
the
host
of
them
read
julia
cloud
and
straightway
the
shining
blue
above
them
took
on
a
personality
and
became
a
witness
in
the
day
proceedings
it
was
as
if
some
one
whom
they
had
known
all
their
lives
quite
familiar
in
their
daily
life
should
suddenly
have
stood
up
and
declared
himself
to
have
been
an
to
most
marvellous
proceedings
the
hazy
blue
with
its
floating
clouds
was
no
longer
a
diversion
from
the
subject
in
hand
their
eyes
were
riveted
with
mysterious
thoughts
as
they
lay
and
listened
astonished
fascinated
it
was
the
first
time
it
had
ever
really
entered
into
their
consciousness
that
there
had
been
a
time
when
there
was
no
blue
no
firm
earth
no
anything
whether
it
were
true
or
not
had
not
as
yet
become
a
question
with
them
they
were
near
enough
to
their
days
to
accept
a
tale
while
it
was
being
read
and
revel
in
it
the
quiet
voice
went
on
and
on
the
seventh
day
god
ended
his
work
which
he
had
made
and
he
rested
on
the
seventh
day
from
all
his
work
which
he
had
made
and
god
blessed
the
seventh
day
and
sanctified
it
because
that
in
it
he
had
rested
from
all
his
work
which
god
created
and
made
what
did
he
have
to
rest
for
a
god
would
get
tired
would
he
burst
forth
leslie
turning
big
inquiring
eyes
on
julia
cloud
i
do
know
unless
he
did
it
for
our
sakes
to
set
us
an
example
she
answered
slowly
although
that
might
mean
he
rested
in
the
sense
of
stopped
doing
it
you
know
and
that
would
imply
that
he
had
some
reason
for
doing
so
i
not
very
wise
you
know
and
because
i
may
not
be
able
to
answer
your
questions
does
mean
they
ca
be
answered
by
some
one
who
has
studied
it
all
out
i
often
wished
i
could
have
gone
to
college
and
studied
greek
and
hebrew
so
i
could
have
read
the
bible
in
the
original
h
said
allison
thoughtfully
that
would
be
interesting
it
i
always
wondered
why
they
did
it
but
i
do
know
but
i
study
them
myself
i
think
i
enjoy
it
if
there
was
a
real
reason
besides
just
the
discipline
of
it
they
are
always
talking
about
when
you
kick
about
mathematics
and
languages
well
said
leslie
sitting
up
interestedly
is
that
all
there
is
to
it
did
some
one
just
up
and
say
we
had
to
keep
sunday
because
god
did
i
think
that
is
a
kind
of
superstition
i
do
see
that
god
would
want
to
make
us
do
everything
he
did
we
could
i
unless
said
to
anyhow
o
les
you
way
off
laughed
her
brother
god
did
he
said
the
sabbath
day
to
keep
it
holy
six
days
shalt
thou
labor
and
do
all
thy
work
but
the
seventh
day
is
the
sabbath
of
the
lord
thy
god
in
it
thou
shalt
not
do
any
work
thou
nor
thy
son
nor
thy
daughter
thy
man
servant
nor
thy
maid
servant
do
you
remember
the
ten
commandments
no
i
guess
you
were
too
little
to
learn
them
but
i
got
a
testament
for
learning
them
once
say
cloudy
when
did
he
give
that
command
right
away
after
he
made
adam
and
eve
i
not
sure
said
julia
cloud
fluttering
the
leaves
of
her
bible
over
to
the
second
slip
of
paper
i
do
find
any
reference
to
it
in
my
concordance
till
way
over
here
in
exodus
after
the
children
of
israel
had
been
in
egypt
so
many
years
and
moses
led
them
out
through
the
wilderness
and
they
got
fretful
because
they
had
any
bread
such
as
they
used
to
have
in
egypt
so
god
sent
them
manna
that
fell
every
morning
but
he
told
them
not
to
leave
any
over
for
the
next
day
because
it
would
gather
worms
and
smell
bad
except
on
saturday
when
they
were
to
gather
enough
for
the
sabbath
listen
they
gathered
it
every
morning
every
man
according
to
his
eating
and
when
the
sun
waxed
hot
it
melted
and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
sixth
day
they
gathered
twice
as
much
bread
two
omers
for
one
man
and
all
the
rulers
of
the
congregation
came
and
told
moses
and
he
said
unto
them
this
is
that
which
the
lord
hath
said
is
the
rest
of
the
holy
sabbath
unto
the
lord
bake
that
which
ye
will
bake
and
seethe
that
ye
will
seethe
and
that
which
remaineth
over
lay
up
for
you
to
be
kept
until
the
morning
and
they
laid
it
up
till
the
morning
as
moses
bade
and
it
did
not
stink
neither
was
there
any
worm
therein
and
moses
said
eat
that
for
is
a
sabbath
unto
the
lord
ye
shall
not
find
it
in
the
field
six
days
ye
shall
gather
it
but
on
the
seventh
day
which
is
the
sabbath
in
it
there
shall
be
none
and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
went
out
some
of
the
people
on
the
seventh
day
for
to
gather
and
they
found
none
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
how
long
refuse
ye
to
keep
my
commandments
and
my
laws
see
for
that
the
lord
hath
given
you
the
sabbath
therefore
he
giveth
you
on
the
sixth
day
the
bread
of
two
days
abide
ye
every
man
in
his
place
let
no
man
go
out
of
his
place
on
the
seventh
day
so
the
people
rested
on
the
seventh
day
it
looks
as
though
the
people
had
been
used
to
the
sabbath
already
for
the
commandments
given
on
the
mount
come
three
whole
chapters
later
it
looks
to
me
as
if
god
established
the
sabbath
right
at
the
beginning
when
he
rested
from
his
own
work
and
that
what
it
means
when
it
says
he
sanctified
it
what
do
you
suppose
he
said
have
given
a
sabbath
for
it
looks
as
if
it
were
meant
for
a
benefit
for
the
people
and
not
for
god
does
it
said
allison
sitting
up
and
looking
over
his
shoulder
why
i
always
supposed
god
wanted
the
sabbath
for
his
own
sake
so
people
would
see
how
great
he
was
julia
cloud
cheeks
grew
red
with
a
flash
of
distress
as
if
he
had
said
something
against
some
one
she
loved
very
much
oh
no
she
said
earnestly
god
is
like
that
why
he
loves
us
he
would
have
given
a
sabbath
at
all
if
it
had
been
quite
necessary
for
our
good
besides
in
the
new
testament
jesus
said
sabbath
was
made
for
man
and
not
man
for
the
sabbath
oh
he
made
it
for
us
to
be
happy
in
i
sure
and
perhaps
he
rested
himself
so
that
we
might
understand
he
had
set
apart
that
time
of
leisure
in
order
to
be
everything
to
us
on
the
day
when
we
had
most
time
for
him
i
have
read
somewhere
that
god
had
to
teach
those
early
people
little
by
little
just
as
we
teach
babies
a
few
things
each
year
and
over
in
the
new
testament
it
says
that
all
these
things
that
happened
in
the
old
testament
to
those
children
of
israel
happened
and
were
written
down
for
an
example
to
us
who
should
live
in
the
later
part
of
the
world
so
little
by
little
by
pictures
and
stories
he
taught
those
people
what
he
wanted
all
of
us
to
know
as
a
sort
of
inheritance
and
he
took
the
things
first
that
were
of
the
most
importance
it
would
seem
as
if
he
considered
this
matter
of
the
sabbath
very
important
and
as
if
he
had
it
in
mind
right
away
at
the
first
when
he
made
the
world
and
intended
to
set
apart
this
day
out
of
every
seven
because
he
stopped
right
off
the
very
first
week
himself
to
establish
a
precedent
and
then
he
it
which
must
mean
he
set
it
apart
in
such
a
way
that
all
the
world
should
understand
what
is
a
precedent
asked
leslie
sharply
oh
you
know
les
it
something
you
have
to
do
just
like
because
you
always
have
done
it
that
way
said
allison
waving
her
aside
but
cloudy
what
i
ca
get
at
at
all
is
why
he
wanted
it
in
the
first
place
if
he
did
want
it
just
entirely
for
his
own
glorification
why
dear
i
am
not
sure
but
i
think
it
was
just
so
that
he
and
we
might
have
a
sort
of
a
when
we
could
be
sure
of
having
nothing
to
interfere
between
us
and
he
meant
it
too
to
be
the
sign
between
himself
and
those
who
really
loved
him
and
were
his
children
a
sign
that
should
show
to
the
world
who
were
his
he
said
so
in
several
places
listen
to
this
she
turned
the
leaves
quickly
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
speak
thou
also
unto
the
children
of
israel
saying
verily
my
sabbaths
ye
shall
keep
for
it
is
a
sign
between
me
and
you
throughout
your
generations
that
ye
may
know
that
i
am
the
lord
that
doth
sanctify
you
ye
shall
keep
the
sabbath
therefore
for
it
is
holy
unto
you
every
one
that
defileth
it
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
for
whosoever
doeth
any
work
therein
that
soul
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
his
people
six
days
may
work
be
done
but
in
the
seventh
is
the
sabbath
of
rest
holy
to
the
lord
whosoever
doeth
any
work
in
the
sabbath
day
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
wherefore
the
children
of
israel
shall
keep
the
sabbath
to
observe
the
sabbath
throughout
their
generations
for
a
perpetual
covenant
it
is
a
sign
between
me
and
the
children
of
israel
forever
for
in
six
days
the
lord
made
heaven
and
earth
and
on
the
seventh
day
he
rested
and
was
refreshed
there
now
said
leslie
sitting
up
that
just
what
i
thought
that
was
only
for
the
children
of
israel
it
has
the
leastest
bit
to
do
with
us
those
were
jews
and
they
keep
it
yet
on
saturday
wait
dear
julia
cloud
turned
the
leaves
of
her
bible
rapidly
to
corinthians
listen
brethren
i
would
not
that
ye
should
be
ignorant
how
that
all
our
fathers
were
under
the
cloud
and
all
passed
through
the
sea
and
were
all
baptized
unto
moses
in
the
cloud
and
in
the
sea
and
did
all
eat
the
same
spiritual
meat
and
did
all
drink
the
same
spiritual
drink
for
they
drank
of
that
spiritual
rock
that
followed
them
and
that
rock
was
christ
but
with
many
of
them
god
was
not
well
pleased
for
they
were
overthrown
in
the
wilderness
now
these
things
were
our
examples
to
the
intent
we
should
not
lust
after
evil
things
as
they
also
lusted
neither
be
ye
idolators
as
were
some
of
them
as
it
is
written
the
people
sat
down
to
eat
and
drink
and
rose
up
to
play
neither
let
us
tempt
christ
as
some
of
them
also
tempted
and
were
destroyed
of
serpents
neither
murmur
ye
as
some
of
them
also
murmured
and
were
destroyed
of
the
destroyer
now
all
these
things
happened
unto
them
for
ensamples
and
they
are
written
for
our
admonition
upon
whom
the
ends
of
the
world
are
come
wherefore
let
him
that
thinketh
he
standeth
take
heed
lest
he
fall
does
that
look
as
though
god
meant
the
sabbath
for
us
too
leslie
leslie
dropped
back
on
her
pillow
of
moss
with
a
sigh
i
it
does
she
answered
somewhat
disconsolately
but
i
never
did
like
sundays
anyhow
and
she
drew
a
deep
breath
of
unrest
but
dear
julia
cloud
hand
rested
on
the
bright
head
lovingly
there
a
closer
sense
than
that
in
which
this
belongs
to
us
if
we
belong
to
christ
we
are
israel
ourselves
i
was
reading
about
it
just
this
morning
how
all
those
who
want
to
be
chosen
people
and
are
willing
to
accept
him
as
their
saviour
are
israel
just
as
much
as
a
born
jew
i
think
i
can
find
it
again
yes
here
it
is
in
romans
they
are
not
all
israel
which
are
israel
neither
because
they
are
the
seed
of
abraham
are
they
all
children
but
in
isaac
shall
thy
seed
be
called
that
is
they
which
are
children
of
the
flesh
these
are
not
the
children
of
god
but
the
children
of
the
promise
are
counted
for
the
seed
that
means
the
promise
that
was
given
to
abraham
that
there
should
be
a
messiah
sometime
in
his
family
who
would
be
the
saviour
of
the
world
and
the
idea
is
that
all
who
believe
in
that
messiah
are
the
real
chosen
people
it
was
to
the
chosen
people
god
gave
these
careful
directions
commands
if
you
like
to
call
them
to
help
them
be
what
a
chosen
people
ought
to
be
and
the
sabbath
rest
and
communion
seems
to
be
the
basis
of
the
whole
idea
of
a
people
who
were
guided
by
god
it
is
the
coming
home
to
god
after
the
toil
of
the
week
they
had
to
have
a
time
when
other
things
did
not
call
them
away
from
spending
a
whole
day
with
him
and
getting
acquainted
from
getting
to
know
what
he
wanted
and
how
to
shape
their
lives
or
they
would
just
as
surely
get
interested
in
the
world
and
forget
god
well
i
do
see
why
we
have
to
go
to
church
anyway
declared
leslie
discontentedly
this
is
a
great
deal
better
out
here
under
the
trees
reading
the
bible
yes
said
allison
cloudy
that
minister
dull
i
know
i
get
anything
out
of
hearing
him
chew
the
rag
o
allison
dear
do
speak
of
god
minister
that
way
why
not
cloudy
maybe
he
is
god
minister
how
did
he
get
there
anyway
just
decided
to
be
a
minister
and
studied
and
got
himself
called
to
that
church
did
he
oh
no
dear
i
trust
not
that
is
terrible
where
ever
did
you
get
such
an
idea
there
may
be
some
unworthy
men
in
the
ministry
of
course
there
must
be
for
the
bible
said
there
would
be
false
leaders
and
wolves
in
sheep
clothing
but
surely
you
know
that
the
most
of
the
men
in
the
pulpit
are
there
because
they
believe
that
god
has
called
them
to
give
up
everything
else
and
spend
their
lives
bringing
the
message
of
the
gospel
to
the
souls
of
men
the
office
is
a
holy
office
and
must
be
reverenced
even
if
we
do
not
fancy
the
man
who
occupies
it
he
may
have
a
message
if
you
listen
for
it
even
though
he
may
seem
dull
to
you
if
you
knew
him
better
could
look
into
his
life
and
see
the
sacrifices
he
has
made
to
be
a
minister
see
the
burdens
of
the
people
he
has
to
bear
o
cloudy
come
now
most
of
the
ministers
i
ever
saw
have
automobiles
and
fine
houses
and
about
as
good
a
time
as
anybody
they
get
big
salaries
and
do
bother
themselves
much
about
anything
but
church
services
and
getting
people
to
give
money
honestly
now
cloudy
jewel
i
think
they
putting
it
over
on
you
i
bet
not
half
of
them
are
sincere
in
that
sacrifice
stuff
they
put
over
it
may
have
been
so
long
ago
but
ministers
have
a
pretty
soft
snap
nowadays
in
cities
anyhow
allison
did
you
ever
see
any
true
sincere
ministers
child
there
are
so
many
many
of
them
to
tell
you
the
truth
cloudy
i
never
saw
but
one
that
did
have
shifty
eyes
he
was
a
little
missionary
chap
that
worked
in
a
slum
settlement
and
would
have
taken
his
out
for
anybody
oh
i
do
mean
that
old
guy
looked
shifty
i
should
say
he
was
just
dull
and
uninteresting
he
may
have
thought
he
had
a
call
long
ago
but
he
been
asleep
so
long
he
forgotten
about
it
o
allison
this
is
dreadful
julia
cloud
closed
her
bible
and
looked
down
in
horror
at
the
frank
young
face
of
the
boy
who
minced
no
words
in
saying
what
he
thought
about
these
holy
things
that
had
always
been
so
precious
and
sacred
to
her
she
felt
like
putting
her
hands
over
her
ears
and
running
away
screaming
her
very
soul
was
in
agony
over
the
desecration
the
children
looked
into
her
face
saw
the
white
scared
look
and
took
warning
there
now
cloudy
do
worry
said
allison
leaning
over
and
patting
her
hand
awkwardly
i
did
mean
to
hurt
you
honest
i
did
perhaps
i
wrong
of
course
i
am
if
you
say
so
i
really
know
any
ministers
anyhow
i
was
just
saying
what
is
the
general
impression
among
the
fellows
i
did
realize
you
would
do
the
young
men
all
think
that
julia
cloud
lips
were
white
and
an
agonized
expression
for
the
church
of
god
had
grown
in
her
eyes
she
searched
the
boy
face
with
a
look
he
did
not
soon
forget
it
made
an
impression
that
stayed
with
him
always
at
least
there
was
something
in
religion
if
it
could
make
her
look
like
that
to
hear
it
lightly
spoken
of
at
least
this
one
woman
was
a
sincere
follower
of
christ
there
now
cloudy
i
tell
you
i
sorry
i
said
that
and
just
to
prove
it
i
go
to
that
old
christian
endeavor
and
try
to
find
something
interesting
i
will
truly
and
les
will
go
too
of
course
said
leslie
nestling
close
forget
what
he
said
and
tell
us
why
we
have
to
go
to
church
cloudy
dear
julia
cloud
tried
to
recall
her
troubled
thoughts
to
the
subject
in
hand
well
god
had
them
build
the
tabernacle
for
worship
you
know
dear
told
them
how
to
make
everything
even
to
the
minutest
details
and
established
worship
that
was
to
be
part
of
the
sabbath
day
a
place
to
worship
and
a
promise
that
he
would
be
there
to
meet
any
one
who
came
that
promise
holds
good
you
need
ever
think
about
the
minister
just
fancy
you
see
christ
in
the
pulpit
he
is
there
come
to
meet
his
own
you
know
he
be
in
that
christian
endeavor
he
was
in
the
tabernacle
of
old
there
was
a
brightness
in
the
cloud
of
his
presence
to
show
the
people
that
god
had
come
down
to
meet
them
they
were
children
and
had
to
be
helped
by
a
visible
manifestation
yes
that
would
be
something
like
said
allison
if
we
could
see
something
to
help
us
believe
those
who
truly
believe
with
the
heart
will
have
the
assurance
said
julia
cloud
earnestly
i
there
was
something
in
her
tone
and
the
look
of
her
eye
that
added
for
i
have
experienced
it
the
young
people
looked
at
her
and
were
silent
there
was
a
long
quiet
pause
in
which
the
sounds
of
the
falling
nuts
and
the
whispering
of
the
hemlocks
closed
in
about
them
and
made
the
day
and
hour
a
sacred
time
at
last
leslie
broke
the
silence
well
cloudy
suppose
we
go
to
church
and
christian
endeavor
what
can
we
do
the
rest
of
the
day
we
do
have
to
go
to
church
every
minute
do
we
i
do
really
see
how
it
going
to
do
me
any
good
i
do
indeed
julia
cloud
smiled
at
her
wistfully
it
was
so
wonderfully
sweet
to
have
this
bright
beautiful
young
thing
asking
her
these
vital
questions
why
deary
it
just
a
day
to
spend
with
god
and
get
to
enjoy
his
company
she
said
let
me
read
you
this
verse
in
isaiah
that
means
the
happiness
of
i
read
it
so
the
happiness
of
the
man
that
doeth
this
and
the
son
of
man
that
layeth
hold
on
it
that
keepeth
the
sabbath
from
polluting
it
and
keepeth
his
hand
from
doing
any
evil
neither
let
the
son
of
the
stranger
that
hath
joined
himself
to
the
lord
there
leslie
that
means
us
or
any
gentiles
that
want
to
be
christ
saying
the
lord
hath
utterly
separated
us
from
his
people
for
thus
saith
the
lord
to
them
keep
my
sabbaths
and
choose
the
things
that
please
me
and
take
hold
of
my
covenant
even
unto
them
will
i
give
in
mine
house
and
within
my
walls
a
place
and
a
name
better
than
of
sons
and
of
daughters
i
will
give
them
an
everlasting
name
that
shall
not
be
cut
off
also
the
sons
of
the
stranger
that
join
themselves
to
the
lord
to
serve
him
and
to
love
the
name
of
the
lord
to
be
his
servants
every
one
that
keepeth
the
sabbath
from
polluting
it
and
taketh
hold
of
my
covenant
even
them
will
i
bring
to
my
holy
mountain
and
make
them
joyful
in
my
house
of
prayer
you
see
allison
there
a
promise
that
will
secure
you
from
feeling
the
service
dull
and
dry
if
you
are
willing
to
comply
with
its
conditions
burnt
offerings
and
their
sacrifices
shall
be
accepted
upon
mine
altar
for
mine
house
shall
be
called
an
house
of
prayer
for
all
people
she
turned
the
leaves
quickly
again
and
now
i
want
to
read
you
the
verse
that
seems
to
me
to
tell
how
god
likes
us
to
keep
the
sabbath
thou
turn
away
thy
foot
from
the
sabbath
from
doing
thy
pleasure
on
my
holy
day
and
call
the
sabbath
a
delight
you
see
leslie
he
does
want
it
to
be
a
dull
poky
day
he
wants
us
to
call
it
a
delight
and
yet
we
are
to
find
our
pleasure
in
him
and
not
in
the
things
that
belong
just
to
ourselves
listen
delight
the
holy
of
the
lord
honorable
and
shalt
honor
him
not
doing
thine
own
ways
nor
finding
thine
own
pleasure
nor
speaking
thine
own
words
then
shalt
thou
delight
thyself
in
the
lord
and
i
will
cause
thee
to
ride
upon
the
high
places
of
the
earth
and
feed
thee
with
the
heritage
of
jacob
thy
father
for
the
mouth
of
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
leslie
suddenly
threw
her
head
in
julia
cloud
lap
right
over
the
bible
and
looked
up
into
her
face
with
an
exquisite
earnestness
all
her
own
cloudy
jewel
it
sounds
all
different
from
anything
i
ever
heard
of
and
i
do
know
how
to
do
it
but
something
inside
says
it
ought
to
be
true
and
i
going
to
try
it
she
said
anyhow
we
had
a
grand
time
this
afternoon
and
it
has
been
a
bit
dull
do
you
suppose
maybe
we
been
in
him
this
afternoon
but
there
goes
the
supper
bell
and
i
hungry
as
a
bear
how
about
that
cloudy
is
it
right
to
cook
on
sunday
that
place
you
read
about
the
man
who
picked
up
sticks
to
make
a
fire
in
camp
does
sound
like
it
well
dear
you
know
in
the
old
times
we
always
got
the
sunday
cooking
and
baking
done
on
saturday
just
as
the
lord
told
the
israelites
to
do
i
have
any
business
to
judge
other
people
and
every
one
must
decide
for
himself
what
is
necessary
and
what
is
not
i
suppose
but
as
for
me
i
like
to
do
as
mother
always
did
i
always
have
the
and
full
of
nice
fresh
things
and
make
a
pie
perhaps
and
cook
a
piece
of
meat
or
have
some
salad
in
the
and
then
it
is
the
work
of
but
a
few
minutes
to
get
the
nicest
kind
of
a
meal
on
sunday
it
is
easy
to
have
a
beefsteak
to
broil
or
cold
meat
or
something
to
warm
up
in
a
minute
if
one
cares
enough
to
get
it
ready
and
it
really
makes
a
lovely
restful
time
on
sunday
to
know
all
that
work
is
done
besides
it
is
any
harder
i
like
it
allison
gathered
up
the
rug
and
books
and
they
walked
slowly
toward
the
inn
watching
the
wonderful
colorings
of
the
foliage
they
passed
and
drinking
in
all
the
woodsy
odors
and
gentle
sounds
of
dying
leaves
and
dropping
nuts
say
cloudy
said
allison
suddenly
out
of
the
midst
of
his
thoughtfulness
why
do
the
ministers
preach
about
all
this
i
had
to
go
to
church
a
lot
when
i
was
in
prep
school
and
i
never
yet
heard
a
sermon
on
it
or
if
i
did
it
was
so
dull
i
did
get
the
hang
of
it
but
i
should
think
if
they
preached
about
it
just
as
you
done
made
it
plain
so
people
could
understand
that
most
folks
that
is
the
ones
who
wanted
to
do
half
right
would
see
to
it
that
sunday
was
so
rotten
well
allison
said
julia
cloud
a
soft
smile
playing
dreamfully
about
her
lips
perhaps
they
do
realize
the
need
perhaps
it
to
you
as
you
say
to
somehow
wake
them
up
and
set
them
at
it
allison
drew
a
long
whistle
and
grinned
as
they
went
into
the
house
chapter
xiii
a
few
minutes
later
julia
cloud
watched
them
go
off
into
the
dusk
to
the
christian
endeavor
meeting
she
was
to
follow
them
in
a
little
while
and
meet
them
for
the
evening
service
she
wondered
as
she
saw
them
disappear
into
the
shadows
of
the
long
avenue
whether
perhaps
she
was
not
overdoing
the
matter
a
little
in
the
way
of
meetings
and
was
almost
sorry
she
had
not
suggested
staying
home
from
the
evening
service
it
would
not
do
to
make
them
weary
of
it
all
on
this
first
sunday
as
they
walked
along
together
the
brother
and
sister
were
thinking
deeply
say
allison
is
this
the
very
funniest
thing
we
ever
did
going
off
like
this
to
a
prayer
meeting
alone
what
did
we
do
it
for
asked
the
sister
well
i
guess
just
because
cloudy
wanted
it
replied
the
brother
she
given
up
her
home
and
everything
for
us
we
ought
to
but
say
les
there
a
whole
lot
in
what
cloudy
was
reading
this
afternoon
if
it
all
true
it
a
wonder
more
people
do
try
it
i
often
wondered
why
we
were
alive
anyway
have
you
there
does
seem
much
sense
to
it
unless
there
something
like
this
oh
i
know
allison
it
nice
to
be
alive
but
of
course
we
never
will
feel
quite
as
if
this
is
the
only
place
since
mother
and
dad
are
here
any
more
are
things
queer
anyway
i
wish
there
was
some
way
to
be
sure
well
i
the
bible
claims
to
be
sure
perhaps
we
could
find
out
a
lot
if
we
read
it
we
likely
to
read
it
quite
a
good
deal
do
you
think
asked
the
sister
archly
but
really
now
it
was
interesting
and
cloudy
a
dear
if
christians
were
all
like
that
i
believe
in
them
perhaps
they
are
real
christians
perhaps
the
ones
we
mean
anything
but
shams
well
there
a
good
many
shams
then
the
big
noisy
bell
began
to
bang
out
a
tardy
summons
now
but
the
two
young
people
did
not
feel
the
same
antipathy
toward
it
that
they
had
felt
the
night
they
heard
it
first
it
seemed
somehow
to
have
a
homely
friendly
sound
as
they
neared
the
open
door
they
grew
suddenly
shy
however
and
drew
back
lingering
on
the
corner
watching
the
few
stragglers
who
walked
into
the
pathway
of
light
that
streamed
from
the
doorway
some
bunch
growled
allison
i
should
say
they
did
need
waking
up
but
i
do
hanker
for
the
job
they
slipped
in
and
followed
the
sound
of
voices
through
a
hall
smelling
of
moldy
ingrain
carpet
into
a
wide
rather
pleasant
chapel
room
there
were
branches
of
autumn
leaves
about
the
walls
reminiscent
of
some
recent
festivity
and
a
bunch
of
in
a
vase
on
the
little
table
by
the
leader
chair
two
girls
were
turning
over
the
picking
out
hymns
for
the
evening
and
a
tall
shy
girlish
young
fellow
was
making
fancy
letters
on
a
blackboard
up
in
front
three
more
girls
with
their
arms
about
one
another
had
surrounded
him
and
were
giggling
and
gurgling
at
him
after
the
manner
of
that
kind
of
girl
another
young
woman
sat
up
at
one
side
her
hands
folded
and
a
look
of
quiet
waiting
on
her
face
that
was
all
that
were
in
the
room
allison
and
leslie
found
a
seat
up
on
the
other
side
from
the
girl
and
sat
down
no
one
noticed
them
save
for
furtive
glances
and
no
one
came
near
them
the
three
giggling
girls
began
to
talk
a
little
louder
one
with
her
hair
bobbed
and
a
long
view
of
vertebrae
above
her
blue
began
to
prattle
of
a
dance

little
pumps

old
topic

use

topics
they
do
mean
anything
i
never
can
find
a
verse
with
the
words
in
i
just
always
ask
for
a
hymn
and
half
the
time
i
give
out
any
old
number
without
knowing
what
it
is
just
to
see
what
it
turn
out
oh
say
did
you
hear
chauncey
cramer
singing
last
sunday
night
broke
out
the
third
girl
with
a
side
glance
at
the
strangers
he
was
perfectly
killing
he
was
twisting
the
words
all
around
in
every
hymn
he
had
girls
names
and
fellers
all
mixed
up
and
made
it
rhyme
in
the
neatest
way
i
thought
i
choke
laughing
and
tarrant
was
just
coming
in
and
looked
at
me
as
if
he
eat
me
oh
my
goodness
there
he
comes
now
we
better
beat
it
hattie
come
on
mabel
sit
back
in
the
last
row
the
three
girls
toppled
down
the
aisle
on
their
pumps
and
rustled
into
the
back
row
just
as
the
pastor
entered
and
looked
about
the
room
his
eyes
brightened
when
he
saw
the
brother
and
sister
and
with
a
pleasant
to
the
three
whispering
misses
in
the
back
seat
he
came
over
to
shake
hands
with
allison
and
leslie
but
when
he
expressed
a
most
cordial
hope
that
the
two
would
come
in
and
help
in
the
young
people
work
allison
was
wary
he
said
they
would
have
to
see
how
much
time
they
had
to
spare
after
college
opened
it
was
altogether
likely
that
they
would
be
exceedingly
busy
with
their
college
work
the
minister
watching
their
bright
faces
wistfully
and
knowing
their
kind
sighed
and
thought
how
little
likelihood
there
was
that
his
christian
endeavor
society
would
see
much
of
them
a
few
more
people
straggled
in
and
one
of
the
girls
who
had
been
picking
out
hymns
went
and
sat
down
at
the
piano
the
other
girl
sat
near
her
the
young
man
at
the
blackboard
took
his
place
at
the
little
table
in
front
of
the
desk
and
the
elaborate
colored
letters
which
he
had
just
made
were
visible
as
a
whole
for
the
first
time
the
great
companion
how
to
live
with
him
there
was
something
startling
and
solemn
in
the
words
as
they
stood
out
in
blue
and
gold
and
crimson
and
white
on
the
little
blackboard
allison
and
leslie
looked
and
turned
wonderingly
toward
the
young
leader
he
had
hair
light
ineffective
blue
eyes
and
a
noticeably
weak
chin
he
did
not
look
like
a
person
who
would
be
putting
forth
a
topic
of
that
sort
and
attempting
to
do
anything
about
it
his
face
grew
pink
and
his
eyelashes
seemed
whiter
in
contrast
as
he
stood
up
to
give
out
the
first
hymn
it
was
plain
that
he
was
painfully
embarrassed
he
glanced
now
and
then
deprecatingly
toward
the
visitors
with
an
anxious
gasp
as
he
announced
that
they
would
open
the
meeting
by
singing
number
the
two
young
strangers
opened
their
and
found
the
place
marvelling
how
such
a
youth
had
ever
been
persuaded
to
get
himself
into
such
a
trying
situation
allison
found
himself
thinking
that
there
must
be
some
power
greater
than
the
ordinary
influences
of
life
that
made
him
do
it
he
seemed
so
much
out
of
his
element
and
so
painfully
shy
all
to
jesus
i
surrender
chirped
the
little
gathering
gayly
they
had
good
voices
and
the
harmony
was
simple
and
pleasing
allison
and
leslie
joined
their
beautiful
voices
in
with
the
rest
and
liked
it
felt
almost
as
if
they
were
on
the
verge
of
doing
something
toward
helping
on
the
kingdom
of
heaven
they
sang
another
hymn
and
more
young
people
came
in
until
there
were
in
the
room
then
the
leader
called
upon
tom
forbes
to
read
the
scripture
and
a
boy
about
fourteen
years
old
read
in
a
clear
voice
the
story
of
the
walk
to
emmaus
to
the
brother
and
sister
whose
bible
knowledge
was
limited
to
the
days
of
their
very
young
childhood
it
was
most
interesting
they
listened
intently
but
were
surprised
to
notice
a
tendency
to
whisper
on
the
part
of
some
especially
the
girls
in
the
back
seat
who
had
been
joined
by
three
young
fellows
of
about
their
own
age
and
caliber
leslie
glancing
over
her
shoulder
at
the
whisperers
saw
they
had
no
thrill
over
the
story
no
interest
save
in
their
own
voluble
conversation
the
story
went
on
to
the
point
where
jesus
at
the
table
blessed
the
bread
and
the
two
men
knew
him
and
he
vanished
out
of
their
sight
without
an
interruption
in
the
whispering
the
great
companion
had
come
into
the
room
and
gone
and
they
had
not
even
known
it
the
leader
rose
and
cleared
his
voice
with
courage
and
then
in
a
tone
of
diffidence
he
recited
the
few
words
he
had
learned
for
the
occasion
our
topic
is
great
companion
how
to
live
with
him
it
seems
hard
to
realize
that
christ
is
still
on
the
earth
that
he
is
with
us
all
the
time
we
ought
to
realize
this
we
ought
to
try
to
realize
it
it
would
make
our
lives
different
if
we
could
realize
that
christ
is
always
with
us
i
expect
some
of
us
would
always
feel
comfortable
if
we
should
find
him
walking
along
with
us
listening
to
our
talk
we
ought
to
try
to
live
so
we
would
feel
all
right
if
we
should
find
christ
walking
with
us
some
day
and
i
heard
a
story
once
about
a
boy
who
had
been
a
cripple
and
he
had
been
a
great
christian
and
when
he
came
to
die
they
asked
him
if
he
was
afraid
and
he
said
no
he
was
afraid
that
it
was
only
going
into
another
room
with
jesus
and
i
think
we
ought
to
all
live
that
way
we
will
now
listen
to
a
solo
by
mame
beecher
after
which
the
meeting
will
be
open
and
i
hope
that
all
will
take
part
it
was
a
crude
little
speech
haltingly
spoken
and
the
speaker
was
evidently
relieved
when
it
was
over
yet
there
had
been
amazing
truth
in
what
he
had
said
and
it
came
to
the
two
visitors
with
the
force
of
newness
as
he
mopped
his
perspiring
brow
with
a
large
handkerchief
and
sat
down
adjusting
his
collar
and
necktie
nervously
they
watched
him
and
marvelled
again
that
he
had
been
willing
to
be
put
in
so
trying
a
position
there
had
been
a
genuineness
about
him
that
brought
conviction
this
young
man
really
believed
in
christ
and
that
he
walked
with
men
allison
always
ready
to
curl
his
lips
over
anything
sissified
sat
watching
him
gravely
here
was
a
new
specimen
he
did
know
where
to
place
him
did
he
to
lead
a
meeting
was
he
a
minister
son
or
something
or
did
he
just
do
it
because
he
wanted
to
because
it
seemed
his
duty
to
do
it
allison
could
not
decide
he
knew
that
he
himself
could
have
made
a
much
better
speech
on
the
subject
but
he
would
not
want
to
he
would
hate
it
talking
about
sacred
things
like
that
out
to
the
world
yet
he
was
frank
enough
to
see
that
a
better
speech
might
not
have
been
so
acceptable
to
god
as
this
halting
one
full
of
repetition
and
crudities
the
girl
up
by
the
piano
was
singing
the
solo
why
did
she
let
herself
be
called
mame
in
that
common
way
she
was
a
rather
girl
with
loud
colors
in
her
garments
and
plenty
of
powder
in
evidence
on
her
otherwise
pretty
face
but
she
had
a
good
voice
and
sang
the
words
distinctly
in
the
secret
of
his
presence
how
my
soul
delights
to
hide
oh
how
precious
are
the
lessons
which
i
learn
at
jesus
side
the
words
were
wonderful
they
somehow
held
you
through
to
the
end
the
girl
named
mame
had
that
quality
of
holding
attention
with
her
voice
and
carrying
a
message
to
a
heart
there
were
two
lines
that
seemed
particularly
impressive
and
you
leave
the
silence
of
that
happy
you
must
mind
and
bear
the
image
of
the
master
in
your
face
leslie
found
herself
looking
around
the
room
to
see
whether
any
one
present
bore
that
image
and
her
eyes
lingered
longest
on
the
quiet
girl
in
the
plain
garments
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
she
had
a
face
that
was
almost
beautiful
in
its
repose
if
it
had
not
worn
that
air
of
utter
reticence
there
was
a
long
pause
after
the
soloist
was
done
and
much
whispering
from
the
back
row
which
at
last
terminated
in
a
flutter
of
bible
leaves
and
the
reading
of
three
bible
verses
containing
the
word
companion
without
much
reference
to
the
topic
from
the
three
girls
on
the
back
seat
passing
the
bible
in
turn
with
much
ado
to
find
their
respective
places
another
hymn
followed
and
a
prayer
from
a
boy
in
spectacles
it
was
a
good
prayer
but
the
young
man
wore
also
that
air
of
reticence
that
characterized
the
girl
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
as
if
he
were
not
a
part
of
these
young
people
had
nothing
in
common
with
them
allison
decided
that
they
were
all
dead
and
surely
did
need
some
one
to
wake
them
up
but
the
task
was
not
to
his
liking
what
had
he
in
common
with
a
bunch
like
that
in
fact
what
had
any
of
them
in
common
that
they
should
presume
to
form
themselves
into
a
society
it
was
rank
nonsense
you
could
bring
people
together
that
had
nothing
in
common
and
make
them
have
a
good
time
these
were
his
thoughts
during
another
painful
pause
during
which
the
pastor
in
the
back
seat
half
rose
then
sat
down
and
looked
questioningly
toward
the
two
visitors
the
young
leader
seemed
to
understand
the
signal
for
he
grew
very
red
looked
at
allison
and
leslie
several
times
cleared
his
throat
turned
over
his
and
finally
said
with
painful
embarrassment
we
should
be
glad
to
hear
from
our
visitors
we
like
to
know
how
you
conduct
things
in
your
society
he
lifted
agonized
eyes
to
allison
and
broke
down
in
a
choking
cough
allison
chilled
with
amazement
filled
with
a
sudden
strange
pity
looked
around
with
growing
horror
to
see
whether
it
was
really
true
that
he
had
been
called
upon
to
speak
in
meeting
then
with
the
old
nonchalance
that
nothing
ever
quite
daunted
he
rose
to
his
feet
why
i
he
began
looking
around
with
a
frank
smile
i
never
was
in
a
christian
endeavor
meeting
before
in
my
life
and
i
do
know
the
first
thing
about
it
my
sister
and
i
only
came
because
somebody
wanted
us
to
so
i
ca
very
well
tell
about
any
other
society
but
i
belong
to
a
college
frat
and
i
suppose
it
a
good
deal
the
same
thing
in
the
long
run
i
been
reading
that
pledge
up
there
on
the
wall
i
suppose
that
your
line
you
got
good
dope
all
right
if
you
live
up
to
that
you
going
some
i
remember
when
i
first
went
to
college
the
fellows
began
to
rush
me
i
had
bids
from
two
or
three
different
frats
and
they
had
me
going
so
hard
i
got
bewildered
i
did
know
which
i
wanted
to
join
then
one
day
one
of
the
older
fellows
got
hold
of
me
and
he
saw
how
it
was
with
me
and
he
said
want
to
look
around
and
analyze
things
just
you
look
the
fellows
over
and
see
how
they
size
up
in
the
different
frats
then
you
see
what
they
stand
for
and
how
they
live
up
to
it
and
lastly
you
look
up
their
alumni
so
i
began
to
size
things
up
and
i
found
that
one
frat
was
all
for
the
social
doings
dances
and
dinners
and
always
having
a
good
time
and
another
was
pretty
wild
had
the
name
of
always
getting
in
bad
with
the
faculty
and
had
the
lowest
marks
in
college
three
fellows
had
been
expelled
the
year
before
for
drunkenness
and
disorderliness
then
another
one
was
known
as
ranking
highest
in
scholarship
and
having
the
most
athletes
in
it
i
looked
over
their
alumni
too
for
they
used
to
come
around
a
good
bit
and
get
in
with
us
boys
and
you
could
see
just
which
were
making
good
out
in
the
world
and
which
were
just
in
life
for
what
they
could
get
out
of
it
and
i
made
my
decision
one
day
just
because
of
one
big
man
who
had
been
out
of
college
for
ten
years
but
he
had
made
good
in
the
world
and
was
known
all
over
as
being
a
successful
man
and
a
wonderful
man
and
he
used
to
come
back
to
every
game
and
everything
that
went
on
at
the
college
and
sit
around
and
talk
with
the
fellows
and
encourage
them
and
if
anybody
was
falling
down
on
his
job
he
would
show
him
where
he
was
wrong
and
how
to
get
into
line
again
and
even
help
him
financially
if
he
got
in
a
tight
place
and
so
i
thought
with
men
like
that
back
of
it
that
frat
was
a
pretty
good
thing
to
tie
up
to
and
i
joined
it
and
found
it
was
even
better
than
i
expected
and
i
was
thinking
as
i
looked
at
the
blackboard
and
heard
you
talking
about
the
great
companion
it
was
something
like
that
man
if
all
that
true
that
you
been
reading
and
saying
why
you
got
pretty
good
things
back
of
you
with
an
alumnus
like
that
nodding
toward
the
blackboard
and
a
line
of
talk
like
that
pledge
you
sure
ought
to
have
a
drag
with
the
world
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
make
everybody
believe
that
it
is
really
so
and
have
this
room
full
for
believe
me
that
the
kind
of
dope
everybody
wants
especially
young
people
whether
they
own
it
or
not
allison
sat
down
abruptly
suddenly
realizing
that
he
had
just
made
a
religious
speech
and
had
the
interest
of
the
meeting
in
his
hands
his
speech
seemed
to
set
loose
something
in
the
heart
of
the
young
leader
for
he
rose
eagerly
alertly
his
embarrassment
departed
and
began
to
speak
i
glad
our
friend
has
spoken
that
way
i
guess
it
all
true
what
he
has
just
said
we
got
the
right
dope
only
we
are
using
it
i
guess
it
looks
mighty
like
to
the
world
as
if
we
did
really
believe
it
all
the
way
we
live
but
believe
me
i
going
to
try
to
make
things
different
in
my
life
this
week
and
see
if
i
ca
make
at
least
one
person
believe
we
have
something
here
they
want
before
next
sunday
he
seemed
about
to
give
out
another
hymn
but
the
plain
girl
spoke
up
and
interrupted
him
she
was
sitting
forward
in
her
chair
an
almost
radiant
look
upon
her
face
that
quite
changed
it
and
she
spoke
rapidly
breathlessly
like
a
shy
person
who
had
a
great
message
to
convey
she
was
looking
straight
at
allison
as
if
she
had
forgotten
everyone
else
in
the
room
i
got
to
speak
she
said
earnestly
it
is
right
to
keep
still
when
i
had
such
a
wonderful
experience
and
you
spoke
as
if
it
might
not
all
be
true
about
christ
being
our
companion
every
day
in
spite
of
himself
allison
met
her
eyes
as
though
they
were
talking
alone
together
and
waited
for
what
she
should
tell
i
always
been
just
a
quiet
christian
she
went
on
and
i
often
speak
here
except
to
recite
a
bible
verse
i
sort
of
a
stranger
myself
but
you
all
ought
to
know
what
christ
has
done
for
me
when
my
people
died
and
everything
in
my
life
was
changed
and
troubles
came
very
thick
and
fast
there
was
anybody
in
the
world
i
could
turn
to
for
help
and
companionship
but
jesus
and
one
day
it
came
to
me
how
my
mother
used
to
feel
about
him
and
i
just
went
to
him
and
asked
him
to
be
my
companion
as
he
used
to
be
hers
i
did
half
believe
he
would
when
i
asked
him
but
i
was
so
hurt
and
alone
i
had
to
do
something
and
i
found
out
it
was
all
true
he
helped
me
in
so
many
little
ways
you
would
believe
it
perhaps
unless
you
could
have
lived
it
out
yourself
i
guess
you
really
have
to
live
it
out
to
know
it
after
all
but
i
found
that
i
could
go
to
him
just
as
if
i
could
see
him
and
i
was
so
surprised
the
first
day
when
he
answered
a
prayer
in
a
perfectly
wonderful
way
it
all
came
over
me
he
loves
me
and
at
first
i
thought
it
was
just
happening
but
i
tried
it
again
and
again
and
every
day
wonderful
things
began
to
come
into
my
life
and
it
got
to
be
that
i
could
talk
with
him
and
feel
his
answer
in
my
heart
if
it
were
not
for
him
i
could
stand
life
sometimes
and
i
sure
he
talk
with
any
one
that
way
who
wants
him
enough
to
try
and
find
him
she
finished
and
then
suddenly
conscious
of
herself
she
sat
back
white
and
shy
again
with
trembling
lips
the
meeting
closed
then
but
while
they
were
singing
the
last
hymn
allison
and
leslie
were
watching
the
face
of
the
quiet
girl
with
the
holy
uplifted
light
on
it
i
think
she
is
lovely
do
you
whispered
leslie
after
the
benediction
as
they
turned
to
go
out
i
like
to
know
her
h
assented
allison
cloudy
would
like
her
i
guess
i
mean
to
find
out
who
she
is
declared
leslie
the
minister
came
up
just
then
with
cordial
greeting
and
urgent
appeal
that
the
young
people
would
at
once
join
their
christian
endeavor
that
was
a
great
talk
you
gave
us
he
said
with
his
hand
resting
admiringly
on
allison
shoulder
we
need
young
blood
you
are
the
very
one
to
stir
up
this
society
but
i
not
a
christian
said
allison
half
laughing
i
belong
here
oh
well
answered
the
smiling
minister
if
you
take
hold
of
the
endeavor
perhaps
you
find
you
more
of
a
christian
than
you
think
come
i
want
you
to
meet
some
of
our
young
people
the
young
people
were
all
gathered
in
groups
looking
toward
the
strangers
and
came
quite
willingly
to
have
a
nearer
glimpse
of
them
last
of
all
and
by
herself
came
the
girl
and
the
minister
introduced
her
as
jane
bristol
he
did
not
speak
to
her
more
than
that
and
it
occurred
to
allison
that
she
seemed
as
if
she
came
more
at
the
instigation
of
some
higher
power
than
at
the
call
of
her
pastor
for
she
passed
quietly
on
again
in
a
pleasant
dignity
and
did
not
stop
to
talk
and
joke
with
her
pastor
as
some
of
the
other
young
people
had
done
who
is
she
asked
allison
hardly
aware
that
he
was
asking
why
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
forger
who
died
in
prison
her
mother
i
believe
died
of
a
broken
heart
sad
experience
for
so
young
a
girl
she
seems
to
be
a
good
little
thing
she
is
working
at
housework
in
town
i
believe
i
understand
she
has
an
idea
of
entering
college
in
the
fall
you
are
entering
college
here
that
will
be
delightful
my
wife
and
i
will
take
pleasure
in
calling
on
you
as
soon
as
you
are
ready
to
receive
visitors
leslie
eyes
were
on
jane
bristol
as
she
moved
slowly
toward
the
door
lingering
a
moment
in
the
hall
none
of
the
other
girls
seemed
to
have
anything
to
do
with
her
with
her
usual
impulsiveness
leslie
left
allison
and
went
swiftly
down
the
aisle
till
she
stood
by
jane
bristol
side
we
are
going
to
meet
my
aunt
and
stay
to
church
would
you
come
and
sit
with
us
she
asked
eagerly
i
like
to
get
acquainted
with
you
jane
bristol
shook
her
head
with
a
wistful
smile
i
sorry
she
said
i
wish
i
could
but
i
take
care
of
a
little
girl
evenings
and
i
only
get
off
long
enough
for
christian
endeavor
it
dear
of
you
to
ask
me
well
you
come
and
see
me
when
i
get
settled
in
my
new
home
you
jane
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
and
then
gave
her
a
beautiful
smile
in
answer
to
leslie
brilliant
one
yes
if
you
find
you
want
me
when
you
get
settled
i
come
she
answered
and
giving
leslie
little
gloved
hand
an
impulsive
squeeze
she
said
and
went
away
leslie
looked
after
her
a
minute
half
understanding
and
then
turned
to
find
her
brother
beside
her
she
thinks
i
wo
want
her
because
she
works
she
said
but
i
do
i
shall
sure
you
will
kid
said
her
brother
just
tell
cloudy
about
her
she
fix
things
that
old
party
i
mean
the
reverend
gentleman
look
out
allison
that
is
any
better
and
there
comes
cloudy
do
make
her
feel
bad
again
well
parson
then
does
seem
to
have
much
use
for
a
person
had
the
misfortune
to
have
her
father
commit
forgery
and
her
mother
die
of
a
broken
heart
or
is
it
because
she
has
to
work
her
way
through
college
he
may
be
all
right
sister
but
i
bank
on
that
girl
religion
over
against
his
any
day
in
the
week
sundays
included
then
julia
cloud
came
up
the
steps
and
they
went
in
to
a
rather
dreary
evening
service
with
a
sparse
congregation
and
a
choir
who
passed
notes
and
giggled
during
the
sermon
allison
and
leslie
sat
and
wondered
what
kind
of
a
shock
it
would
be
to
them
all
if
the
great
companion
should
suddenly
become
visible
in
the
room
if
all
that
about
his
being
always
present
was
true
it
certainly
was
a
startling
thing
chapter
xiv
the
next
morning
dawned
with
a
dull
dreary
drizzle
coming
noisily
down
on
the
red
and
yellow
leaves
of
the
maple
by
the
window
but
the
three
rose
joyously
and
their
ardor
was
not
damped
six
days
shalt
thou
labor
and
do
all
thy
work
quoted
allison
at
the
cloudy
we
got
to
hustle
do
you
mind
if
it
does
rain
we
got
our
car
but
julia
cloud
smiled
unconcernedly
i
should
worry
she
said
with
a
gay
imitation
of
leslie
inimitable
toss
of
the
head
and
the
two
young
people
laughed
so
hilariously
that
the
other
staid
couples
already
in
the
turned
in
amaze
to
see
who
was
taking
life
so
happily
on
a
day
like
this
they
piled
into
the
car
and
hied
themselves
to
town
at
once
chattering
joyfully
over
their
list
as
to
which
things
they
would
buy
first
let
begin
with
the
kitchen
said
leslie
i
crazy
to
learn
how
to
make
cookies
cloudy
you
teach
me
how
so
i
can
make
some
all
myself
wo
you
and
waffles
said
allison
from
the
front
seat
i
remember
cloudy
waffles
and
buckwheat
cakes
we
going
to
have
everything
for
the
kitchen
to
make
things
easy
so
that
when
we
ca
get
a
maid
cloudy
wo
be
always
overdoing
said
leslie
guardy
told
me
especially
about
that
he
said
we
were
to
get
every
convenience
to
make
things
easy
so
the
cook
leave
for
he
rather
pay
any
amount
than
have
cloudy
work
herself
to
death
and
have
to
break
down
and
leave
us
so
it
was
the
department
of
the
great
store
to
which
they
first
repaired
and
there
they
hovered
for
two
hours
among
tins
and
aluminum
and
wooden
ware
discussing
the
relative
charms
of
refrigerators
and
vacuum
cleaners
and
the
new
ideas
against
the
old
julia
cloud
was
for
careful
buying
and
getting
along
with
few
things
the
children
were
infatuated
with
the
idea
of
a
kitchen
of
their
own
and
wanted
everything
in
sight
they
went
wild
over
a
new
kind
of
refrigerator
that
would
freeze
its
own
ice
making
in
the
bargain
and
run
by
an
electric
motor
but
here
julia
cloud
held
firm
no
such
expensive
experiment
was
needed
in
their
tiny
kitchen
a
small
white
kind
was
good
enough
for
them
so
the
children
immediately
threw
their
enthusiasm
into
selecting
the
best
kind
of
freezer
when
they
finally
went
to
the
for
lunch
everything
on
julia
cloud
list
was
carefully
checked
off
by
allison
with
its
respective
price
and
while
they
were
waiting
to
be
served
he
added
the
column
twice
to
make
sure
he
was
right
we
shy
five
dollars
yet
of
what
we
planned
to
spend
on
our
kitchen
cloudy
he
announced
radiantly
what
did
i
tell
you
but
where
would
you
have
been
if
i
had
let
you
get
that
refrigerator
she
retorted
well
there
were
a
lot
of
things
we
did
really
need
he
answered
such
as
what
oh
and
well
all
those
pans
did
you
need
so
many
he
answered
helplessly
they
laughed
his
masculine
judgment
out
of
countenance
and
chatted
away
about
what
they
should
do
next
until
their
order
arrived
they
were
like
three
children
as
they
ate
their
lunch
recalling
now
and
then
some
purchase
which
gave
them
particular
pleasure
suddenly
julia
cloud
lifted
her
hands
in
mock
distress
i
know
what
we
forgotten
she
said
why
sure
we
have
to
have
a
lot
so
we
can
all
wipe
dishes
when
the
cook
goes
out
will
five
dollars
buy
them
cloudy
asked
leslie
distressingly
well
i
certainly
should
hope
so
said
julia
cloud
laughing
the
idea
five
dollars
worth
of
well
we
go
and
get
them
at
once
said
leslie
and
after
that
we
do
the
bedrooms
five
found
them
wending
their
way
homeward
once
more
tired
but
happy
now
said
julia
cloud
leaning
back
on
the
soft
cushions
i
think
we
had
better
stay
at
home
and
receive
the
things
the
house
must
be
cleaned
at
once
and
then
we
can
put
things
right
where
they
are
going
to
belong
allison
you
ought
to
be
able
to
get
a
man
to
wash
windows
i
ask
the
chambermaid
about
a
woman
to
help
clean
and
leslie
and
i
will
make
curtains
while
you
put
up
the
rods
they
were
so
interesting
a
trio
at
their
table
in
the
inn
that
night
that
people
around
began
to
ask
who
were
those
two
charming
young
people
and
their
beautiful
mother
little
ripples
of
query
went
around
the
room
as
they
entered
for
they
were
indeed
noticeable
anywhere
the
young
people
were
bubbling
over
with
life
and
spirits
and
kindliness
and
julia
cloud
in
her
silvery
robes
and
her
white
hair
made
a
pleasant
picture
but
they
were
so
wholly
wrapped
up
in
their
own
housekeeping
plans
that
they
were
utterly
unaware
of
the
interest
they
excited
in
their
just
at
present
they
had
no
time
to
spare
on
other
people
they
were
playing
a
game
just
as
they
used
to
play
house
when
they
were
little
with
their
aunt
and
they
wanted
no
interruption
until
they
should
have
completed
the
home
and
were
ready
to
move
in
and
begin
to
live
after
that
other
people
might
come
in
for
their
attention
the
next
morning
bright
and
early
allison
was
up
and
out
hunting
his
man
and
announced
triumphantly
at
the
that
he
was
found
and
would
be
down
at
the
house
and
ready
for
work
in
half
an
hour
breakfast
became
a
brief
ceremony
after
that
for
julia
cloud
also
had
not
been
idle
and
had
procured
the
address
of
a
good
woman
to
clean
the
house
allison
rushed
off
after
the
car
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
on
their
way
first
to
leave
julia
cloud
and
leslie
at
the
house
to
superintend
the
man
and
then
to
hunt
the
woman
he
presently
returned
with
a
large
colored
woman
sitting
imposingly
in
the
back
seat
her
capable
hands
folded
in
her
lap
a
look
of
intense
satisfaction
on
her
ample
countenance
julia
cloud
had
thoughtfully
brought
from
home
a
large
bundle
of
and
a
little
heater
presently
supplied
hot
water
leslie
made
a
voyage
of
discovery
and
purchased
soap
and
and
soon
the
whole
little
house
was
a
hive
of
workers
now
said
julia
cloud
opening
the
bundle
of
curtain
material
where
shall
we
begin
right
here
said
leslie
looking
around
the
big
white
with
satisfaction
i
just
longing
to
see
this
look
like
a
home
and
you
must
admit
cloudy
that
this
room
is
the
real
heart
of
the
house
we
eat
and
sleep
and
work
and
study
in
the
other
rooms
but
here
we
really
live
right
around
that
dear
fireplace
i
just
crazy
to
see
it
made
up
and
burning
oh
wo
it
be
great
busy
hands
and
shining
scissors
went
to
work
measuring
cutting
turning
hems
and
presently
a
neat
pile
of
white
curtains
the
hems
all
turned
ready
for
stitching
lay
in
the
wide
back
then
they
went
at
the
other
rooms
the
room
and
the
but
before
that
was
quite
finished
a
large
arrived
and
behold
the
had
come
leslie
was
so
eager
to
get
at
it
that
she
could
hardly
wait
until
the
rest
of
the
load
was
properly
disposed
she
was
not
an
experienced
sewer
but
she
brought
to
her
work
an
enthusiasm
that
stood
loyally
beside
her
aunt
experience
and
soon
some
of
the
curtains
were
up
they
could
not
bear
to
stop
and
go
back
to
the
inn
for
lunch
so
allison
ran
down
to
the
with
the
car
and
brought
back
buns
cut
into
halves
and
buttered
with
great
slices
of
ham
in
them
a
pail
of
hot
sweetened
coffee
a
big
cocoanut
pie
a
bag
of
cakes
and
a
basket
of
grapes
and
they
made
a
picnic
of
it
our
first
meal
in
our
own
house
is
it
great
cried
leslie
dancing
around
with
a
roll
sandwich
in
one
hand
and
a
wedge
of
pie
in
the
other
by
night
every
clean
little
window
in
that
house
was
curtained
with
white
drapery
and
in
some
rooms
also
with
inner
curtains
of
soft
silk
the
house
began
to
look
cozy
in
spite
of
its
emptiness
and
they
could
hardly
bear
to
leave
it
when
sunset
warned
them
that
it
was
getting
near
and
they
must
return
to
the
inn
to
freshen
up
for
the
evening
another
day
at
the
little
house
completed
the
cleaning
and
curtaining
and
by
this
time
all
the
furniture
so
far
purchased
had
arrived
and
they
had
no
need
to
be
there
to
watch
for
anything
else
so
another
day
of
shopping
was
agreed
upon
and
i
move
we
pick
out
the
piano
first
of
all
said
leslie
just
crazy
to
get
my
fingers
on
the
keys
again
and
you
do
know
how
well
allison
can
sing
cloudy
you
just
ought
to
hear
him
oh
boy
julia
cloud
smiled
adoringly
at
the
two
and
agreed
that
the
piano
was
as
good
a
place
as
any
to
begin
that
day
was
the
best
of
all
the
wonderful
shopping
to
julia
cloud
to
be
actually
picking
out
wonderful
mahogany
furniture
such
as
she
had
seen
occasionally
in
houses
of
the
rich
such
as
she
had
admired
in
pictures
and
read
of
in
magazine
articles
seemed
too
wonderful
to
be
true
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
to
live
among
beautiful
things
and
she
felt
as
if
she
had
stepped
into
at
least
the
anteroom
of
heaven
it
troubled
her
a
little
to
be
allowing
the
children
to
spend
so
much
even
though
their
guardian
had
made
it
plain
that
they
had
plenty
to
spend
for
it
did
not
seem
quite
right
to
use
so
much
on
one
self
when
so
many
were
in
need
but
gradually
her
viewpoint
began
to
change
it
was
true
that
these
things
were
only
relative
and
what
seemed
much
to
her
was
little
to
another
perhaps
coming
directly
from
her
exceedingly
limited
sphere
she
was
no
fit
judge
of
what
was
right
and
necessary
and
of
course
there
was
always
the
fact
that
good
things
lasted
and
were
continually
beautiful
if
well
chosen
also
much
good
might
be
done
to
a
large
circle
of
outsiders
by
a
beautiful
home
so
julia
cloud
because
the
matter
of
expenditure
was
not
after
all
in
her
hands
decided
just
to
have
a
good
time
and
enjoy
picking
out
these
wonderful
things
interfering
only
where
she
thought
the
article
the
children
selected
was
not
worth
buying
or
was
foolish
and
useless
but
on
the
whole
they
got
along
beautifully
and
agreed
most
marvellously
about
what
fitted
the
little
stone
villa
as
leslie
had
named
it
villa
that
what
call
it
she
cried
one
day
in
sudden
inspiration
and
so
it
was
called
thereafter
in
loving
jest
two
days
more
of
hard
work
and
their
list
was
nearly
finished
by
this
time
they
were
almost
weary
of
continually
trying
to
decide
which
thing
to
get
a
bewildering
jumble
of
french
gray
bedsteads
and
mahogany
tables
and
chairs
swung
around
in
their
minds
when
they
went
to
sleep
at
night
and
smilingly
met
their
waking
thoughts
they
were
beginning
to
long
for
the
time
when
they
could
sit
down
in
the
chairs
and
get
acquainted
with
their
beds
and
tables
and
feel
at
home
i
wish
we
could
get
in
by
sunday
grumbled
allison
it
fierce
hanging
around
this
hotel
with
nothing
to
do
well
why
not
assented
julia
cloud
as
she
buttered
her
breakfast
muffin
the
bedding
was
promised
to
come
out
this
morning
and
i
do
see
why
we
could
make
up
the
beds
and
sleep
there
although
i
do
know
whether
we
can
get
the
connected
in
time
to
do
much
cooking
oh
we
can
come
back
here
for
our
meals
till
next
week
declared
leslie
then
we
have
time
to
get
the
dishes
unpacked
and
washed
and
put
in
that
lovely
perhaps
we
be
able
to
get
at
that
the
curtains
are
every
blessed
one
up
inside
and
out
now
and
if
we
succeed
in
getting
that
maid
that
you
heard
of
why
we
be
all
fixed
for
next
week
i
do
wish
those
california
things
would
arrive
and
we
could
get
the
rugs
down
it
does
look
homey
without
rugs
and
pictures
and
sure
enough
they
had
not
been
at
work
ten
minutes
before
the
telephone
bell
rang
and
the
freight
agent
announced
that
their
goods
were
at
the
station
and
asked
whether
they
wanted
them
sent
up
for
he
wanted
to
get
the
car
out
of
his
way
in
two
hours
more
the
goods
arrived
and
right
in
the
midst
of
their
unloading
the
from
the
city
brought
a
lot
more
articles
and
so
the
little
house
was
a
scene
of
lively
action
for
some
time
when
the
last
truck
had
started
away
from
the
house
allison
drove
the
car
up
now
cloudy
you
jump
in
quick
and
we
going
back
to
the
inn
for
lunch
then
you
lie
down
and
rest
a
whole
hour
and
sleep
or
i
let
you
come
back
he
announced
i
saw
a
tired
look
around
your
eyes
and
it
wo
do
we
are
not
going
to
have
you
worked
out
not
if
we
stay
in
that
old
inn
for
another
month
so
there
he
packed
them
in
and
whirled
them
away
to
the
inn
in
spite
of
julia
cloud
protest
that
she
was
not
tired
and
wanted
to
work
but
when
they
came
back
at
two
they
all
felt
rested
and
fit
for
work
again
now
i
the
man
and
i
going
to
boss
for
a
while
said
allison
you
two
ladies

and
make
beds
here
which
are
the
blankets
and
sheets
i
take
the
bundles
right
up
there
and
you
wo
have
any

up
and

to
do
these
all
of
them
all
right
now
come
on
up
and
i
be
undoing
the
rugs
and
boxes
from
california
when
you
come
down
they
be
all
ready
for
you
to
say
where
they
shall
go
leslie
and
her
aunt
laughingly
complied
and
had
a
beautiful
time
unfolding
and
spreading
the
fine
white
sheets
plumping
the
new
pillows
into
their
cases
laying
the
soft
blankets
and
pretty
white
spreads
till
each
bed
was
fair
and
fit
for
a
good
night
sleep
and
then
at
the
foot
of
each
was
plumped
in
a
puff
of
beauty
the
bright
satin
eiderdowns
that
leslie
had
insisted
upon
for
julia
cloud
blue
for
leslie
and
orange
and
brown
for
allison
who
had
insisted
upon
mahogany
and
quiet
colors
for
his
room
leslie
furniture
was
and
julia
cloud
room
was
furnished
in
french
gray
enamel
with
insets
of
fine
she
stood
a
moment
in
the
open
doorway
and
looked
about
the
place
soft
gray
walls
with
a
trellis
of
roses
at
the
top
filmy
white
draperies
with
a
touch
of
rose
a
gray
couch
luxuriously
upholstered
with
many
pillows
some
rose
some
gray
a
thick
gray
rug
under
her
feet
and
her
own
little
gray
desk
drawn
out
conveniently
when
she
wanted
to
write
over
all
a
flood
of
autumn
sunshine
and
on
the
wall
a
great
of
a
marvellous
sunset
that
leslie
had
insisted
belonged
in
that
room
and
must
be
bought
or
the
furnishing
would
not
be
complete
it
filled
julia
cloud
eyes
with
tears
of
wonder
and
gratitude
to
think
that
such
a
princess
abode
should
have
come
to
be
her
after
her
long
years
of
barren
living
in
dreary
surroundings
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
the
sunset
picture
on
the
wall
and
it
reminded
her
of
the
evening
when
she
had
stood
at
her
own
home
window
in
her
distress
and
sorrow
looking
into
the
gray
future
and
had
watched
it
break
into
before
her
eyes
for
just
an
instant
after
leslie
had
run
she
closed
her
door
and
dropped
upon
her
knees
beside
the
lovely
bed
to
thank
her
lord
for
this
green
and
pleasant
pasture
where
he
had
led
her
tired
feet
allison
had
all
the
rugs
spread
out
on
the
porch
and
lawn
and
he
and
leslie
were
hard
at
work
giving
them
a
good
sweeping
they
were
wonderful
rugs
just
such
as
one
would
expect
to
come
from
a
home
of
wealth
where
money
had
never
been
a
consideration
julia
cloud
looked
at
them
almost
with
awe
recognizing
by
instinct
the
priceless
worth
of
them
and
almost
afraid
at
the
idea
of
living
a
common
daily
life
on
them
for
julia
cloud
had
read
about
rugs
she
knew
that
in
far
lands
poor
peasant
people
whole
families
sometimes
wove
their
history
into
them
for
a
mere
pittance
and
they
had
come
to
mean
something
almost
sacred
in
her
thoughts
but
allison
and
leslie
had
no
such
reverence
for
them
and
they
swept
away
gayly
and
slammed
them
about
familiarly
in
a
happy
hurry
to
get
them
in
place
so
presently
the
big
blue
chinese
rug
covered
the
almost
literally
for
it
was
an
immense
one
and
left
very
little
margin
around
it
a
handsome
kermanshah
in
old
rose
and
old
gold
with
pencillings
of
black
was
spread
forth
under
the
mahogany
and
a
rich
and
black
bokhara
runner
fitted
the
as
if
it
had
been
bought
for
it
the
smaller
rugs
were
quickly
disposed
here
and
there
a
lovely
little
silk
prayer
rug
being
forced
upon
julia
cloud
for
her
bedroom
as
just
the
finishing
touch
it
needed
and
leslie
took
possession
of
two
or
three
smaller
blue
rugs
for
her
room
then
they
turned
their
attention
to
pictures
bits
of
jade
and
bronze
a
few
rare
pieces
of
furniture
a
wonderful
old
bronze
lamp
with
a
great
dragon
on
a
sea
of
wonderful
blue
enamel
with
a
shade
that
cast
an
amber
light
brass
andirons
and
fender
and
a
lot
of
other
little
things
that
go
to
make
a
lovely
home
now
said
allison
when
we
get
our
books
unpacked
and
some
magazines
thrown
around
it
will
look
like
living
cloudy
can
we
sleep
here
why
surely
said
julia
cloud
with
a
delight
in
her
eyes
what
to
hinder
i
feel
as
if
i
was
in
a
dream
and
if
i
did
go
right
on
playing
it
was
true
i
would
wake
up
and
find
it
all
gone
so
they
rode
back
to
the
inn
for
their
supper
hurried
their
belongings
into
the
trunk
and
moved
bag
and
baggage
into
the
new
house
at
nine
on
saturday
night
while
leslie
and
her
aunt
were
putting
away
their
clothes
from
the
trunk
into
the
new
closets
and
allison
brought
in
a
few
kindlings
and
made
a
bit
of
a
fire
on
the
hearth
and
now
he
called
them
down
we
got
to
have
a
housewarming
the
first
night
cloudy
he
called
come
down
and
see
how
it
all
looks
in
the
firelight
so
the
two
came
and
all
three
sat
together
on
the
velvet
settee
in
front
of
the
fireplace
julia
cloud
in
the
middle
and
a
child
on
either
side
they
were
all
very
tired
and
did
not
say
much
just
sat
together
happily
watching
the
wood
blaze
up
and
flicker
and
fall
into
embers
presently
both
children
nestled
closer
to
her
and
put
down
a
head
on
each
of
her
shoulders
so
they
sat
for
a
long
time
quietly
now
said
julia
cloud
as
the
fire
died
down
and
the
room
grew
dusky
with
shadows
it
is
time
we
went
to
bed
but
there
is
something
i
wish
we
could
do
this
first
night
in
our
new
home
do
you
think
we
ought
to
dedicate
it
to
god
or
at
least
thank
god
for
giving
it
to
us
would
you
be
willing
to
kneel
down
with
me
and
we
might
just
all
pray
silently
if
you
do
feel
like
praying
out
loud
would
you
be
willing
to
do
that
there
was
a
tender
silence
for
a
moment
while
the
children
thought
sure
growled
allison
huskily
you
pray
out
cloudy
we
like
it
yes
whispered
leslie
nestling
her
hand
in
her
aunt
and
so
trembling
half
fearful
her
heart
in
her
throat
but
bravely
julia
cloud
knelt
with
a
child
on
either
side
hiding
wondering
embarrassed
but
loyal
faces
there
was
a
tense
silence
while
julia
cloud
struggled
for
words
to
break
through
her
unwilling
lips
and
then
quite
softly
she
breathed
o
dear
christ
come
and
dwell
in
this
home
and
bless
it
help
us
to
live
to
please
thee
help
me
to
be
a
wise
guide
to
these
dear
children
she
paused
her
voice
suddenly
giving
way
with
a
nervous
choke
in
her
throat
and
two
young
hands
instantly
squeezed
her
hands
in
sympathy
then
a
gruff
young
voice
burst
out
on
one
side
help
me
to
be
good
and
not
hurt
her
or
make
it
hard
for
her
and
leslie
gasped
out
and
me
too
dear
god
then
a
moment
more
and
they
all
rose
tears
on
their
faces
in
the
dying
firelight
they
kissed
julia
cloud
fervently
and
said
chapter
xv
leslie
and
allison
did
not
go
to
the
christian
endeavor
meeting
that
second
sunday
they
were
tired
out
and
wanted
to
stay
at
home
all
the
evening
and
julia
cloud
felt
that
it
would
be
unwise
to
urge
them
so
they
sat
around
the
fire
and
talked
leslie
sat
down
at
the
new
piano
and
played
softly
old
hymns
that
julia
cloud
hummed
and
they
all
went
to
bed
early
having
had
a
happy
sabbath
in
their
new
home
but
monday
evening
quite
early
just
after
they
had
come
back
from
supper
and
were
talking
about
reading
a
story
aloud
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
their
first
caller
and
behold
there
stood
the
young
man
who
had
led
the
christian
endeavor
meeting
the
boy
with
the
goggles
who
had
prayed
and
the
two
girls
who
had
sat
by
the
piano
we
a
committee
announced
the
young
man
quite
embarrassed
my
name
herricote
joe
herricote
i
president
of
our
christian
endeavor
society
and
this
is
roy
bryan
he
the
secretary
this
is
mame
beecher
i
guess
you
remember
her
singing
she
chairman
of
our
social
committee

lila
cary
our
pianist
and
chairman
of
the
music
committee
we
come
to
see
if
you
wo
help
us
come
in
said
allison
cordially
but
with
a
growing
disappointment
now
here
were
these
dull
people
coming
to
interrupt
their
pleasant
evening
and
there
would
be
many
of
them
for
college
would
soon
begin
and
they
would
be
too
busy
then
to
read
stories
and
just
enjoy
themselves
leslie
too
frowned
but
came
forward
politely
to
be
introduced
she
knew
at
a
glance
that
these
were
not
people
of
the
kind
she
cared
to
have
for
friends
we
a
committee
repeated
young
herricote
sitting
down
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
and
looking
around
most
uncomfortably
at
the
luxurious
apartment
he
had
not
realized
it
would
be
like
this
he
was
beginning
to
feel
like
a
fish
out
of
water
as
for
the
rest
of
the
committee
they
were
overawed
and
dumb
all
except
the
little
fellow
with
the
glasses
he
was
not
looking
at
anything
but
allison
and
was
intent
on
his
mission
when
he
saw
that
his
superior
had
been
struck
dumb
he
took
up
the
story
they
appointed
us
to
come
and
interview
you
and
see
if
you
give
us
some
new
ideas
how
to
run
our
society
so
it
would
be
a
success
he
put
in
they
all
liked
your
speech
so
much
the
other
night
they
felt
you
could
help
us
out
of
the
rut
we
got
into
me
asked
allison
laughing
incredulously
why
i
told
you
i
know
the
first
thing
about
christian
endeavor
but
we
got
ta
have
your
help
said
the
young
secretary
earnestly
this
thing
got
ta
go
it
needed
in
our
church
and
it
the
only
thing
in
the
town
to
help
some
of
the
young
people
it
just
go
well
if
you
feel
that
way
you
make
it
go
i
sure
encouraged
allison
you
just
the
kind
of
a
fellow
to
make
it
go
you
know
all
about
it
not
i
never
heard
of
the
thing
till
last
week
except
just
in
a
casual
way
do
know
much
about
it
yet
well
it
was
one
of
your
frats
and
it
was
succeeding
what
would
you
do
you
saw
what
kind
of
a
meeting
we
had
only
a
few
there
and
nobody
taking
much
interest
how
would
you
pull
up
a
frat
that
was
that
way
well
said
allison
speaking
at
random
i
look
around
and
find
some
of
the
right
kind
of
fellows
and
rush
get
in
some
new
blood
that
all
right
said
bryan
doggedly
i
rushin
you
how
do
you
do
it
i
never
went
to
college
yet
so
i
do
know
allison
laughed
now
he
rather
liked
this
queer
boy
he
a
nut
he
said
to
himself
and
entered
into
the
talk
in
earnest
why
you
have
parties
and
rides
and
good
times
generally
and
invite
a
fellow
and
make
him
feel
at
home
and
make
him
want
to
belong
see
i
see
said
bryan
with
a
twinkling
glance
at
the
rest
of
his
committee
we
have
a
party
down
at
my
house
friday
night
will
you
come
allison
saw
that
the
joke
was
on
him
and
his
reserve
broke
down
entirely
well
i
guess
it
up
to
me
to
come
he
said
yes
i
game
come
bryan
turned
his
big
goggles
on
leslie
will
you
come
why
yes
if
allison
does
i
will
agreed
leslie
dimpling
that
all
right
said
bryan
turning
back
to
allison
now
what
do
you
do
when
you
rush
you
have
to
teach
us
how
well
said
allison
thoughtfully
we
generally
pick
out
our
best
rushers
the
ones
that
can
talk
best
and
put
them
wise
we
never
let
the
fellow
that
rushed
know
what
we
doing
oh
if
he
has
brains
he
always
knows
of
course
but
you
do
say
you
rushing
him
in
so
many
words
at
college
we
meet
a
fellow
at
the
train
and
show
him
around
the
place
and
put
him
onto
all
the
little
things
that
will
make
it
easy
for
him
and
we
invite
him
to
eat
with
us
and
help
him
out
in
every
way
we
can
we
appoint
some
one
to
look
after
him
specially
and
a
certain
group
have
him
in
their
charge
so
the
other
frats
wo
have
a
chance
to
rush
him
i
see
the
other
frats
being
represented
by
the
devil
i
suppose
said
the
boy
keenly
without
a
smile
allison
stared
at
him
and
then
broke
into
a
laugh
again
exactly
he
cried
you
got
onto
the
idea
it
your
society
over
against
the
other
things
that
can
draw
them
away
from
what
you
stand
for
see
and
then
there
another
thing
you
want
to
have
something
ready
to
show
them
when
you
get
them
there
that
where
our
alumni
come
in
they
often
run
down
to
college
for
a
few
days
and
help
us
out
with
money
and
influence
and
experience
if
you
got
good
working
alumni
you
right
in
it
you
see
we
generally
appoint
a
committee
to
talk
things
over
with
the
alumni
you
mean
said
bryan
drawing
his
brows
together
in
a
comical
way
behind
his
goggles
you
mean
pray
i
suppose
why
said
allison
flushing
i
suppose
that
would
be
a
good
idea
i
had
thought
of
it
just
in
that
way
you
called
christ
our
alumnus
the
other
night
reminded
the
literal
youth
solemnly
so
i
did
acknowledged
allison
embarrassedly
well
i
guess
right
but
i
do
know
much
about
that
kind
of
line
i
afraid
there
do
many
of
us
put
in
the
bashful
president
i
would
hardly
know
who
to
appoint
on
such
a
committee
there
only
two
or
three
like
to
pray
in
our
meetings
there
bryan
we
always
ask
him
because
he
does
mind
and
i
well
i
do
sometimes
when
there
no
one
else
but
it
comes
hard
and
there
old
miss
ferby
but
she
always
prays
so
long
and
gets
in
the
president
and
all
the
missionary
stations
i
should
think
you
ask
that
jane
bristol
spoke
up
leslie
earnestly
i
know
she
must
be
able
to
she
talked
that
way
i
suppose
she
would
responded
the
president
hesitatingly
looking
toward
the
two
ladies
of
the
committee
with
a
half
apology
what
do
you
girls
think
about
it
oh
i
suppose
she
could
said
the
girl
called
mame
with
a
shrug
she
does
you
know
often
in
meeting
then
with
a
giggle
toward
leslie
she
added
as
if
in
explanation
she
works
you
know
it
must
be
very
hard
for
her
said
leslie
purposely
ignoring
the
inference
well
you
know
she
is
in
our
set
nobody
has
much
to
do
with
her
why
not
i
think
she
is
very
unusual
said
leslie
with
just
the
least
bit
of
hauteur
well
it
would
be
wise
to
get
her
into
things
it
might
keep
some
others
out
if
we
made
her
prominent
put
in
lila
cary
with
some
asperity
we
must
have
some
social
distinction
you
know
in
our
frat
one
fellow
is
as
good
as
another
if
he
has
the
right
kind
of
character
remarked
allison
dryly
that
girl
sounded
to
me
as
if
she
had
some
drag
with
your
alumni
but
of
course
you
know
her
better
than
i
she
is
a
good
girl
all
right
and
real
religious
hastened
lila
to
amend
i
suppose
she
be
real
good
on
a
prayer
committee
and
would
help
to
fill
up
there
as
you
have
many
well
i
tell
you
one
thing
said
allison
if
you
really
want
to
succeed
you
got
to
pull
together
every
member
of
you
or
you
wo
get
anywhere
and
i
should
think
that
you
have
to
be
careful
now
at
first
whom
you
get
in
of
course
after
you
pretty
strong
you
can
take
in
a
few
just
to
help
them
but
if
you
get
in
too
many
of
that
lame
kind
your
society
go
bad
the
weak
kind
will
rule
and
the
mischief
will
be
to
pay
i
should
think
it
would
help
you
any
just
now
to
get
in
any
folks
that
would
feel
that
way
about
a
good
girl
just
because
she
earns
her
living
mame
beecher
and
lila
cary
looked
at
each
other
in
alarm
and
hastened
to
affirm
that
they
never
felt
that
way
about
jane
bristol
thought
she
was
a
real
good
sort
and
had
always
meant
to
get
acquainted
with
her
only
she
always
slipped
out
as
soon
as
meeting
was
over
back
in
the
behind
the
hangings
julia
cloud
lingered
and
smiled
over
the
way
her
two
children
were
developing
opinions
and
character
how
splendid
of
them
to
take
this
stand
and
who
was
jane
bristol
assuredly
she
must
be
looked
up
and
helped
if
that
was
the
way
the
town
felt
about
her
poor
child
well
said
bryan
in
a
tone
i
secretary
joe
you
call
that
prayer
committee
together
thursday
night
at
your
house
at
seven
and
i
send
a
notice
to
each
one
you
make
jane
bristol
chairman
and
i
be
on
the
committee
and
i
go
after
her
and
take
her
home
now
who
else
are
you
going
to
have
on
it
the
president
assented
readily
he
was
one
not
used
to
taking
the
initiative
but
he
eagerly
did
as
he
was
told
when
a
good
idea
presented
itself
we
want
you
on
it
he
said
nodding
to
allison
and
then
looking
shyly
at
leslie
added
and
you
oh
said
leslie
flushing
in
fright
what
would
we
have
to
do
i
never
prayed
before
anybody
in
my
life
i
not
sure
i
even
know
how
to
pray
only
just
to
say
you
to
god
sometimes
i
think
you
could
find
somebody
better
we
got
to
have
you
this
time
said
the
president
shaking
his
head
you
need
pray
if
you
do
want
to
but
you
must
come
and
help
us
through
but
i
could
go
and
be
a
a
sort
of
slacker
said
leslie
her
cheeks
quite
beautifully
red
that
all
right
you
come
said
bryan
looking
solemnly
at
her
when
the
visitors
finally
took
themselves
away
allison
polite
to
the
last
closed
the
door
with
a
courteous
and
then
stood
frowning
at
the
fire
julia
cloud
came
softly
into
the
room
and
went
and
stood
beside
him
with
loving
question
in
her
eyes
he
met
her
gaze
with
a
new
kind
of
hardness
now
you
see
what
you
let
me
in
for
cloudy
when
you
made
me
go
to
that
little
old
dull
christian
endeavor
but
i
wo
do
it
that
all
there
is
to
it
you
need
think
i
going
to
the
idea
why
what
did
we
come
here
to
college
for
to
run
an
asylum
for
sick
sunday
schools
i
like
to
know
as
if
i
had
time
to
monkey
with
their
little
old
society
it
rank
nonsense
anyhow
what
good
do
they
think
they
can
do
a
couple
of
sissies
and
two
or
three
kid
vamps
setting
up
to
lisp
religion
it
ridiculous
he
was
working
himself
up
into
a
fine
frenzy
julia
cloud
stood
and
watched
him
an
amused
smile
growing
on
her
sweet
lips
he
caught
the
amusement
and
fired
up
at
it
what
are
you
looking
like
that
at
me
for
cloudy
you
know
it
is
you
know
it
all
foolishness
and
you
know
i
could
help
them
anyhow
come
now
do
you
are
you
looking
like
that
for
cloudy
i
believe
you
laughing
at
me
you
think
i
go
and
get
into
this
thing
but
i
show
you
i
and
that
an
end
of
it
cloudy
i
insist
on
knowing
what
you
find
to
laugh
at
in
this
situation
why
i
was
just
thinking
how
much
you
reminded
me
of
moses
said
julia
cloud
sweetly
of
screamed
allison
half
angrily
why
he
was
a
meek
man
and
i
not
meek
i
mad
out
and
out
cloudy
what
do
you
mean
oh
no
he
was
always
meek
said
his
aunt
thoughtfully
and
he
talked
just
as
you
are
doing
when
god
called
on
him
first
to
lead
the
children
of
israel
out
of
egypt
he
said
he
could
and
he
and
he
should
and
made
every
excuse
in
the
calendar
and
finally
god
had
to
send
along
aaron
to
help
him
although
god
had
said
would
be
with
him
and
make
him
perfectly
able
alone
to
do
what
he
wanted
done
i
suppose
i
aaron
sighed
leslie
settling
into
a
big
chair
by
the
fire
but
i
do
like
those
girls
one
bit
and
i
do
care
if
they
stay
in
seven
egypts
now
look
here
cloudy
jewel
pleaded
allison
you
not
going
to
get
me
into
any
such
corner
as
that
the
idea
that
god
would
call
me
to
do
any
of
his
work
when
i
never
had
anything
at
all
to
do
with
the
church
in
my
life
and
i
do
want
to
how
should
i
know
what
to
do
why
should
he
ever
call
me
i
like
to
know
when
i
do
know
the
first
thing
about
churches
you
all
off
cloudy
think
again
why
i
not
even
what
you
call
a
christian
he
surely
would
call
people
that
have
well
what
you
call
enlisted
with
him
would
he
he
might
answered
julia
cloud
reflectively
she
was
sitting
on
the
end
of
the
big
blue
couch
and
the
firelight
played
over
her
white
hair
with
silvery
lights
and
cast
a
lovely
rose
tint
over
her
sweet
face
there
were
several
instances
where
he
called
people
who
had
never
known
him
at
all
who
in
fact
were
worshipping
idols
and
strange
gods
and
told
them
to
go
and
do
something
for
him
there
was
paul
he
was
actually
against
him
and
there
was
abraham
he
lived
among
regular
and
god
called
him
to
go
into
a
strange
land
and
founded
a
new
family
for
him
the
beginning
of
the
peculiar
people
through
whose
line
was
to
come
jesus
the
saviour
of
the
world
and
abraham
went
oh
nonsense
cloudy
that
was
in
those
times
of
course
there
was
anybody
else
i
suppose
and
he
had
to
take
some
one
but
now
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
go
to
church
all
the
time
and
like
that
sort
of
thing
how
do
you
know
allison
perhaps
you
are
the
only
one
in
this
town
and
god
has
sent
you
here
just
to
do
this
special
work
well
i
wo
and
that
flat
cloudy
so
you
can
put
the
idea
right
out
of
your
head
i
wo
not
even
for
you
anything
that
has
to
do
with
your
personal
comfort
i
would
say
that
about
of
course
but
this
belongs
entirely
to
that
little
old
ratty
church
and
i
anything
at
all
to
do
with
it
and
i
want
you
to
forget
it
cloudy
for
not
going
to
do
why
allison
you
mistaken
about
me
it
is
my
affair
and
i
do
intend
to
make
it
so
i
did
get
this
up
it
between
you
and
god
if
god
really
called
you
you
have
to
say
no
to
him
not
to
me
i
do
intend
to
make
excuses
to
god
for
you
child
you
think
it
and
besides
there
another
thing
you
very
much
mistaken
about
and
that
is
that
you
have
anything
to
do
with
the
church
when
you
were
a
little
baby
six
months
old
your
father
and
mother
brought
you
home
to
our
house
and
the
first
sunday
they
were
there
they
took
you
to
the
old
church
where
all
the
children
and
grandchildren
had
been
christened
for
years
and
they
stood
up
and
assented
to
the
vows
that
gave
you
to
god
and
they
promised
for
themselves
that
they
would
do
their
best
to
bring
you
up
in
the
nurture
and
admonition
of
the
lord
until
you
came
to
years
and
could
finish
the
bond
by
giving
yourself
to
the
lord
i
shall
never
forget
the
sweet
serious
look
on
the
face
of
your
lovely
when
she
bowed
her
head
in
answer
to
the
minister
question
you
thus
promise
allison
had
stopped
in
his
angry
walk
up
and
down
the
room
and
was
looking
at
her
interestedly
is
that
right
cloudy
was
i
baptized
in
the
old
sterling
church
i
never
knew
that
tell
me
about
it
and
he
seated
himself
on
the
other
end
of
the
couch
while
leslie
switched
off
the
light
and
nestled
down
between
them
scenting
a
story
was
i
too
cloudy
she
asked
hungrily
no
dear
i
think
you
were
baptized
in
california
in
your
church
and
i
sorry
to
say
i
was
there
to
see
so
i
ca
tell
you
about
it
but
i
remember
very
distinctly
all
about
christening
for
we
were
all
so
happy
to
have
it
happen
in
the
east
and
he
was
the
first
grandchild
and
we
had
seen
your
father
for
over
two
years
nor
ever
seen
his
young
wife
before
so
it
was
a
great
event
it
was
a
beautiful
bright
october
day
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
making
the
dress
you
wore
allison
every
stitch
by
hand
hemstitching
and
embroidery
and
all
and
right
in
the
midst
of
the
ceremony
you
looked
over
your
father
shoulder
and
saw
me
sitting
in
the
front
seat
and
smiled
the
sweetest
smile
then
you
jumped
up
and
down
in
your
father
arms
and
spatted
your
little
pink
hands
together
and
called
out
that
what
you
used
to
call
me
then
and
everybody
all
over
the
church
smiled
how
could
they
help
it
gee
i
must
been
some
kid
said
allison
slipping
down
into
a
comfortable
position
among
the
pillows
say
cloudy
i
knew
a
good
thing
when
i
saw
it
even
then
did
i
you
know
allison
that
ceremony
was
just
all
on
your
father
and
mother
part
it
entailed
some
responsibility
upon
you
it
was
part
of
your
heritage
and
you
no
right
to
waste
it
any
more
than
if
it
were
gold
or
bank
stock
or
houses
and
lands
it
was
your
title
to
a
heavenly
sonship
and
it
gave
god
the
right
to
call
upon
you
to
do
whatever
he
wants
you
to
do
it
between
you
and
god
now
and
have
to
settle
it
yourself
it
not
anything
i
could
settle
for
you
either
way
much
as
i
might
want
it
because
it
is
you
who
must
answer
god
and
you
must
answer
him
from
the
heart
either
way
so
nobody
else
has
anything
to
do
with
it
oh
cloudy
you
certainly
can
put
things
in
an
awkward
way
oh
hang
it
now
this
whole
evening
spoiled
i
wish
i
gone
to
the
front
door
at
all
i
wish
i
turned
out
the
lights
and
let
knock
and
there
was
that
story
you
were
going
to
read
and
now
it
too
late
why
no
it
not
too
late
at
all
said
julia
cloud
consulting
her
little
watch
in
the
firelight
it
only
quarter
to
nine
and
sure
we
can
indulge
ourselves
a
little
and
finish
the
story
before
we
go
to
bed
turn
the
light
on
and
get
the
magazine
with
an
air
of
finality
julia
cloud
put
aside
the
debated
question
and
settled
herself
in
the
big
willow
chair
by
the
lamp
with
her
book
leslie
went
back
to
her
chair
by
the
fire
and
allison
flung
himself
down
on
the
couch
with
a
pillow
half
over
his
eyes
but
anybody
watching
closely
would
have
seen
that
his
eyes
were
wide
open
and
he
was
studying
the
calm
quiet
profile
of
his
aunt
sweet
face
as
she
read
in
a
gentle
even
tone
paragraph
after
paragraph
without
a
flicker
of
disturbance
on
her
brow
allison
was
not
more
than
half
listening
to
the
story
he
was
thinking
hard
those
things
julia
cloud
had
said
about
obligations
and
moses
and
abraham
and
paul
stuck
hard
in
his
mind
and
he
could
get
away
from
them
chapter
xvi
julia
cloud
said
nothing
more
to
her
boy
about
that
christian
endeavor
society
but
she
said
much
to
her
lord
praying
continually
that
he
might
be
led
to
see
his
duty
and
want
to
do
it
and
that
through
it
he
might
be
led
to
know
christ
in
the
meantime
she
went
sunnily
about
setting
the
new
home
to
rights
and
getting
the
right
maid
to
fit
into
their
household
régime
julia
cloud
had
never
had
a
maid
in
her
life
but
she
had
always
had
ideas
about
one
and
she
put
as
much
thought
and
almost
as
much
care
into
preparing
the
little
chamber
the
maid
was
to
occupy
as
she
had
put
upon
the
other
rooms
to
begin
with
the
room
itself
was
admirably
adapted
to
making
the
right
maid
feel
at
home
and
comfortable
it
had
three
windows
looking
into
gardens
on
the
next
block
and
a
blaze
of
salvia
and
cosmos
and
geraniums
would
greet
her
eyes
the
first
time
she
looked
out
from
her
new
room
then
it
had
a
speck
of
a
bathroom
all
its
own
which
julia
cloud
felt
would
go
a
long
way
toward
making
any
maid
the
right
maid
for
there
would
be
no
excuse
for
her
not
being
clean
and
no
excuse
for
her
keeping
her
down
on
the
edge
of
the
kitchen
sink
or
taking
a
bath
in
the
laundry
tubs
as
she
had
heard
that
some
of
her
neighbors
maids
had
done
at
various
times
the
windows
were
shrouded
with
white
curtains
of
the
same
kind
as
those
all
over
the
house
and
within
were
draperies
with
bright
flower
borders
the
bureau
was
daintily
fitted
out
and
the
bed
was
spotless
and
a
cushioned
stood
beside
a
small
table
with
a
dainty
on
the
shelf
below
and
against
the
wall
were
some
shelves
with
a
few
interesting
books
and
magazines
a
droplight
with
a
pretty
shade
gave
a
air
and
the
room
was
as
attractive
as
any
other
in
the
house
any
maid
might
think
her
lines
had
fallen
in
pleasant
places
who
was
fortunate
enough
to
occupy
that
room
as
a
last
touch
julia
cloud
laid
a
neat
testament
on
the
table
and
then
knelt
beside
the
and
asked
god
to
make
the
unknown
comer
a
blessing
to
their
house
and
help
them
all
to
be
a
blessing
to
her
then
she
went
down
to
the
car
and
let
allison
take
her
out
to
the
addresses
that
had
been
given
her
as
a
result
by
wednesday
the
little
gay
chamber
up
the
stairs
was
occupied
by
a
sturdy
colored
girl
about
eighteen
years
old
who
rejoiced
in
the
name
of
cherry
and
was
at
once
adopted
as
part
of
the
new
household
with
the
same
spirit
with
which
everything
else
had
been
done
perhaps
if
every
household
would
go
about
it
in
the
same
way
it
would
go
far
toward
settling
the
servant
question
when
cherry
was
introduced
into
her
bedchamber
the
look
on
her
face
was
worth
seeing
it
was
in
the
early
evening
when
she
arrived
riding
on
the
front
seat
of
the
wagon
that
brought
her
trunk
and
when
she
was
ushered
in
by
julia
cloud
with
leslie
in
the
offing
to
see
what
the
newcomer
would
say
to
it
the
girl
stepped
in
gave
a
wild
glance
around
then
backed
off
and
rolled
her
eyes
at
her
new
mistress
this
ai
ai
puttin
me
inta
dis
year
fine
bedroom
she
exclaimed
in
a
kind
of
horror
yes
this
is
your
room
said
julia
cloud
kindly
stepping
in
and
moving
a
chair
a
little
farther
from
the
bed
that
there
might
be
room
for
the
girl
trunk
you
can
put
your
trunk
right
here
i
should
think
and
here
is
your
closet
swinging
open
the
closet
door
and
showing
a
plenitude
of
hooks
and
hangers
and
that
is
your
bathroom
she
pushed
back
the
crash
curtain
that
shut
off
the
tiny
bathroom
and
stood
back
smiling
but
the
girl
was
not
looking
at
her
she
had
cast
one
wild
look
around
and
then
her
eyes
had
been
riveted
on
the
little
vase
on
her
bureau
containing
a
single
late
rose
that
leslie
had
found
blooming
in
the
small
garden
at
the
rear
and
put
there
for
good
luck
she
said
could
it
be
that
any
one
had
cared
to
pick
a
flower
for
a
servant
room
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
dropped
her
bundles
on
the
floor
and
came
over
to
where
her
new
mistress
stood
oh
she
said
in
a
choked
voice
if
is
goin
to
treat
me
like
jest
goin
to
wuk
my
fingahs
to
de
bone
for
youse
after
the
advent
of
cherry
things
began
to
settle
down
into
something
like
routine
the
inn
was
abandoned
entirely
and
each
meal
was
a
festive
occasion
cherry
took
kindly
to
the
that
julia
cloud
knew
well
how
to
give
light
wonderful
white
bread
came
forth
from
the
oven
sweet
rich
nutty
loaves
of
brown
bread
even
more
delectable
waffles
and
muffins
and
pancakes
vied
with
one
another
to
make
one
meal
better
than
another
apple
dumpling
cherry
pie
and
blackberry
varied
with
chocolate
steamed
pudding
lemon
custard
and
velvet
whip
made
the
desserts
an
eagerly
awaited
surprise
leslie
hovered
over
everything
new
that
was
made
and
wanted
to
have
a
hand
in
it
each
day
she
learned
some
new
and
wholesome
fact
about
housekeeping
and
seemed
to
take
to
the
knowledge
readily
her
first
attempt
at
real
cooking
was
learning
to
make
bread
and
when
she
succeeded
so
well
that
allison
thought
it
was
his
aunt
baking
she
declared
her
intention
of
making
it
once
a
week
just
to
keep
her
hand
in
allison
had
said
no
more
about
christian
endeavor
and
when
thursday
afternoon
came
he
asked
his
aunt
to
ride
to
the
city
after
a
few
little
articles
that
were
still
needed
to
make
the
house
complete
they
had
a
pleasant
trip
and
julia
cloud
entirely
forgot
that
the
young
people
had
been
asked
to
attend
the
committee
meeting
that
evening
perhaps
allison
was
waiting
for
her
to
speak
about
it
for
he
looked
at
his
watch
uneasily
several
times
and
glanced
back
at
his
aunt
suspiciously
but
she
sat
serenely
enjoying
the
ride
and
said
nothing
at
last
just
as
they
were
nearing
home
he
burst
forth
with
cloudy
do
you
really
think
we
ought
to
go
to
that
thing
julia
cloud
lifted
quiet
eyes
and
smiled
i
did
say
you
ought
to
go
did
i
dear
well
yes
you
sorta
did
cloudy
julia
cloud
shook
her
head
i
do
think
i
did
i
said
it
was
a
matter
for
me
to
meddle
with
well
do
you
no
allison
not
unless
you
feel
that
god
has
called
you
and
you
are
willing
to
do
what
he
wants
you
to
if
you
just
went
because
you
thought
i
wanted
you
to
go
i
do
believe
it
would
be
worth
while
because
you
would
be
working
with
the
right
spirit
but
as
i
said
before
that
is
something
you
have
got
to
account
for
to
god
not
to
me
allison
drew
his
brows
in
a
frown
and
said
no
more
but
he
was
almost
silent
at
supper
and
ate
with
an
abstracted
air
at
quarter
to
eight
he
flung
down
the
magazine
he
had
been
reading
and
got
up
well
i
i
got
to
go
to
that
bloomin
thing
he
said
half
angrily
come
on
kid
you
going
leslie
hurried
into
her
hat
and
cape
and
they
went
off
together
allison
grumbling
in
a
low
voice
all
the
time
julia
cloud
sat
apparently
reading
watching
the
little
byplay
and
praying
that
god
would
strengthen
the
young
heart
dear
moses
she
murmured
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
as
the
front
door
banged
behind
the
children
and
she
was
left
reading
alone
two
hours
later
the
two
returned
full
of
enthusiasm
leslie
was
brimming
over
o
cloudy
we
going
to
give
this
sleepy
old
town
the
surprise
of
a
lifetime
we
going
to
have
a
grand
time
night
just
getting
all
the
members
together
and
doping
it
out
what
to
do
and
you
ought
to
hear
allison
talk
he
just
like
a
man
he
made
a
wonderful
speech
telling
them
how
they
ought
to
get
together
and
everybody
do
teamwork
and
all
that
like
they
do
in
football
and
they
asked
him
to
make
it
over
again
night
and
he
going
to
leslie
eyes
were
shining
with
pride
and
she
looked
at
her
brother
lovingly
he
flushed
embarrassedly
well
what
could
you
do
cloudy
there
they
were
sitting
like
a
lot
of
boobs
and
nobody
knowing
what
to
do
except
that
jane
bristol
she
the
only
sensible
one
of
the
bunch
and
they
do
listen
to
her
they
made
me
mad
ignoring
her
suggestions
the
way
they
did
so
i
had
to
speak
up
and
say
she
was
right
and
i
guess
i
talked
a
lot
more
when
i
got
started
because
she
really
had
the
right
dope
all
right
and
they
ought
to
have
had
sense
enough
to
know
it
she
been
in
this
work
before
and
been
to
big
state
conventions
and
things
say
cloudy
that
christian
endeavor
stuff
must
be
a
pretty
big
thing
it
seems
to
have
members
all
over
the
world
and
it
really
a
kind
of
international
fraternity
i
rather
like
their
line
it
stiff
all
right
but
that
the
only
way
if
you
going
into
a
thing
like
that
and
how
did
the
praying
go
asked
julia
cloud
watching
her
handsome
eager
face
as
he
talked
all
right
he
evaded
reticently
prayed
cloudy
announced
leslie
proudly
it
was
well
what
could
a
fellow
do
said
allison
apologetically
as
if
he
had
done
something
he
was
half
ashamed
of
that
poor
girl
prayed
something
wonderful
and
then
they
all
sat
and
sat
like
a
parcel
of
boobs
until
you
could
feel
her
cheeks
getting
red
and
nobody
opening
their
mouths
so
i
started
in
i
did
know
what
to
say
but
i
thought
somebody
ought
to
say
something
i
did
the
best
i
knew
how
it
was
regular
cloudy
repeated
leslie
with
shining
eyes
well
it
got
started
anyhow
said
allison
that
was
all
that
mattered
julia
cloud
with
lips
trembling
joyously
into
a
smile
of
thanksgiving
listened
and
felt
her
heart
glad
somehow
she
knew
that
her
boy
had
yielded
himself
to
the
call
of
his
god
to
lead
this
band
of
young
people
out
of
an
egypt
into
a
promised
land
and
she
saw
as
by
faith
how
he
himself
would
be
led
to
talk
with
god
on
the
mount
before
the
great
work
was
completed
it
really
was
regular
cloudy
reiterated
leslie
i
did
know
my
brother
could
pray
like
that
or
talk
either
after
he
prayed
everybody
prayed
just
a
sentence
or
two
even
that
little
baby
doll
lila
that
was
here
the
other
night
they
did
say
much
but
you
could
see
they
wanted
to
do
the
right
thing
and
be
right
in
it
but
everybody
was
in
earnest
they
really
were
cloudy
that
jane
bristol
is
wonderful
the
president
had
told
her
she
was
chairman
and
all
about
the
meeting
and
she
read
some
verses
out
of
the
bible
about
christ
being
always
in
a
meeting
where
there
were
just
two
or
three
and
about
two
or
three
agreeing
to
ask
for
something
and
always
getting
it
i
never
knew
there
were
such
verses
in
the
bible
did
you
well
and
after
that
it
seemed
awfully
solemn
just
as
if
we
had
all
come
into
god
and
were
waiting
to
ask
him
as
a
big
favor
to
help
this
little
christian
endeavor
society
to
be
worth
something
in
his
kingdom
those
are
my
words
cloudy
you
look
surprised
that
the
way
jane
bristol
put
it
and
it
made
me
feel
queer
all
down
my
back
when
she
said
it
as
it
did
the
first
time
i
went
to
hear
some
great
music
and
why
after
that
you
help
praying
just
a
little
so
the
promise
would
hold
good
it
square
not
to
help
them
out
you
see
and
we
not
going
to
have
anybody
night
but
the
regular
members
until
we
get
them
all
to
understand
and
be
ready
to
help
went
on
allison
yes
they
asked
allison
to
take
charge
and
help
plan
it
all
out
and
allison
is
going
to
hunt
up
some
of
the
big
christian
endeavor
people
in
the
city
and
get
them
to
come
out
one
or
two
at
a
time
to
our
meetings
julia
cloud
noted
the
pronoun
our
with
satisfaction
and
stir
things
up
on
sundays
and
we
drive
in
and
get
them
and
bring
them
to
our
house
to
supper
maybe
and
put
them
wise
to
things
so
they
know
best
how
to
help
and
then
drive
them
home
after
church
that
night
see
and
allison
suggested
that
we
have
pretty
soon
a
series
of
parties
or
receptions
just
for
the
young
people
to
get
together
and
bring
new
ones
in
one
at
a
time
just
as
the
boys
in
college
have
you
know
have
a
reception
real
formal
with
regular
eats
from
a
caterer
and
flowers
and
invitations
and
everything
for
the
first
one
and
a
party
for
the
october
meeting
and
a
banquet
for
the
november
meeting
just
about
thanksgiving
time
you
know
oh
going
to
be
lots
of
fun
and
cloudy
i
told
them
we
make
a
hundred
sandwiches
for
night
you
do
mind
do
you
we
can
buy
the
bread
and
it
wo
take
long
to
make
them
i
know
how
to
cut
them
in
pretty
shapes
and
i
thought
i
tie
them
with
ribbons
to
match
the
lemonade
julia
cloud
with
radiant
face
entered
into
the
plans
eagerly
and
to
have
heard
them
talk
one
would
never
have
imagined
that
hours
before
these
two
young
people
had
been
exceedingly
averse
to
having
anything
to
do
with
that
little
dying
christian
endeavor
young
people
society
and
cloudy
that
jane
bristol
is
real
pretty
she
had
on
a
charming
collar
and
her
hair
fixed
all
soft
around
her
face
she
has
beautiful
hair
i
think
they
were
all
surprised
at
the
easy
way
she
talked
i
do
believe
she
is
a
day
older
than
i
am
either
and
she
going
to
college
i
awfully
glad
for
i
want
to
get
to
know
her
we
invite
her
down
here
sometimes
wo
we
i
want
you
to
know
her
cloudy
you
like
her
i
sure
so
julia
cloud
went
to
her
pretty
gray
bed
that
night
and
lay
marvelling
at
the
goodness
of
god
to
answer
her
prayers
as
for
the
children
they
could
hardly
settle
down
to
sleep
so
full
of
plans
were
they
for
the
revivifying
of
that
christian
endeavor
society
they
kept
calling
back
and
forth
from
room
to
room
and
after
everything
had
been
quiet
for
a
long
time
and
julia
cloud
was
just
dropping
off
to
sleep
leslie
woke
them
all
up
calling
to
know
if
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
have
the
party
there
at
the
house
and
have
everybody
come
in
costume
then
they
had
to
begin
all
over
again
and
decide
what
they
would
wear
and
who
they
would
be
allison
declared
he
was
going
to
be
a
firecracker
he
had
a
dandy
costume
for
it
in
california
and
he
would
write
morning
to
the
housekeeper
to
look
it
up
leslie
wanted
to
have
a
with
apples
and
nuts
and
raisins
for
refreshments
julia
cloud
began
to
wonder
whether
it
was
just
as
acceptable
to
god
to
have
play
mixed
up
with
the
religion
as
these
children
were
doing
it
you
must
look
out
that
your
festivities
do
get
ahead
of
your
righteousness
she
warned
half
laughingly
but
allison
took
her
in
earnest
you
right
there
cloudy
that
one
of
the
things
we
have
to
look
out
for
in
frats
we
have
to
see
we
do
have
too
many
social
things
if
we
do
the
marks
suffer
and
right
away
we
lose
ground
we
have
to
keep
those
sunday
meetings
up
to
the
mark
see
kid
or
the
other
things
will
only
bring
in
a
lot
of
that
wo
count
they
must
come
to
the
sunday
meetings
or
they
do
get
invited
to
the
parties
that
the
way
we
fix
there
no
use
saying
said
leslie
wisely
if
you
do
have
your
meetings
interesting
they
wo
come
anyhow
you
fix
it
that
a
girl
for
you
scorned
allison
no
loyalty
in
the
whole
bunch
they
got
to
everything
now
the
real
spirit
is
to
come
and
the
meetings
good
just
because
they
meetings
see
kid
yes
i
see
snapped
leslie
but
i
wo
come
to
your
old
meetings
at
all
if
you
are
going
to
talk
that
way
about
girls
i
guess
always
been
loyal
to
everything
especially
you
and
i
wo
stand
for
that
oh
i
did
mean
you
kid
i
was
talking
about
girls
in
general
soothed
the
brother
you
all
right
of
course
but
those
little
that
sat
in
the
back
seat
now
you
have
to
teach
them
what
loyalty
means
see
finally
the
household
settled
to
sleep
the
next
day
the
little
house
saw
little
else
done
save
the
making
of
marvellous
dainty
sandwiches
in
various
forms
and
shapes
even
cherry
entered
into
the
work
with
zest
and
julia
cloud
proved
herself
rich
in
suggestion
for
different
fillings
till
great
platters
of
the
finished
product
reposed
in
the
big
white
refrigerator
neatly
tucked
about
with
damp
napkins
to
keep
them
from
drying
all
that
day
allison
flew
hither
and
yon
in
his
car
carrying
some
member
of
the
committee
on
errands
connected
with
the
evening
social
never
had
such
a
stir
been
made
about
a
mere
church
social
in
all
the
annals
of
the
society
every
remotest
member
was
hunted
out
and
persuaded
to
be
present
and
allison
agreed
to
go
around
in
the
evening
and
pick
up
at
least
a
dozen
who
had
professed
their
inability
to
get
there
alone
so
the
big
blue
car
was
enlisted
in
christian
endeavor
service
and
the
young
people
were
as
busy
and
as
happy
as
ever
they
had
been
in
getting
their
little
new
home
settled
they
drove
away
about
seven
after
a
hasty
supper
with
their
platters
of
sandwiches
safely
guarded
on
the
back
seat
and
julia
cloud
watched
them
and
smiled
and
was
glad
she
wondered
whether
this
work
would
get
such
a
hold
upon
them
that
it
would
last
after
they
started
their
college
work
and
fervently
hoped
that
it
might
so
that
there
would
be
another
link
to
bind
them
to
god
house
and
his
work
she
sighed
to
think
how
many
things
there
would
likely
be
to
draw
them
away
about
ten
leslie
telephoned
she
wanted
to
bring
jane
bristol
home
for
the
night
as
the
people
where
jane
was
living
were
away
and
she
would
otherwise
have
to
stay
alone
in
a
big
house
julia
cloud
readily
assented
and
she
and
cherry
had
a
pleasant
putting
one
of
the
in
order
it
was
while
she
was
doing
this
that
she
began
to
wonder
seriously
what
jane
bristol
would
be
like
who
was
brought
intimately
into
their
new
home
might
mean
so
much
to
her
two
children
and
in
this
room
too
after
cherry
had
gone
to
bed
she
knelt
and
breathed
a
consecrating
prayer
then
she
went
to
wait
for
the
coming
of
her
children
building
up
the
fire
and
lighting
the
porch
light
so
that
all
would
be
cheery
and
attractive
for
them
and
their
guest
only
a
little
lonesome
child
who
did
housework
for
her
living
but
it
was
good
to
be
able
to
give
her
a
pleasant
welcome
in
a
few
minutes
the
car
arrived
and
the
two
girls
came
chattering
in
while
allison
put
the
car
away
at
least
leslie
was
chattering
i
think
you
look
so
lovely
in
that
soft
blue
dress
she
was
saying
it
is
so
graceful
and
the
color
just
fits
your
eyes
it
only
some
old
chiffon
i
had
answered
the
guest
half
ashamed
i
had
to
wash
it
and
dye
it
and
make
it
myself
and
i
was
sure
the
pleats
would
iron
out
or
that
it
would
do
at
all
you
know
i
do
have
much
use
for
evening
dresses
and
i
really
could
afford
to
get
one
that
the
reason
i
hesitated
at
your
suggestion
about
having
receptions
and
parties
but
i
guess
you
have
to
have
them
you
do
mean
to
say
you
made
it
all
yourself
why
you
a
wonder
is
she
cloudy
just
take
her
in
and
look
for
yourself
she
made
that
dress
all
herself
out
of
old
things
that
she
washed
and
dyed
why
it
looks
like
an
imported
frock
does
it
look
like
one
cloudy
and
that
girdle
is
darling
all
shirred
that
way
that
was
julia
cloud
introduction
to
the
guest
as
she
stood
in
the
open
door
and
watched
the
two
trip
along
the
brick
terrace
to
the
entrance
leslie
snatched
away
the
long
dark
cloak
that
covered
jane
dress
and
she
stood
forth
embarrassed
in
the
firelight
clad
in
soft
chiffon
in
simple
straight
lines
blending
into
the
white
throat
in
a
little
round
neck
and
draping
the
white
girlish
arms
the
firelight
and
lamplight
glimmered
and
flickered
over
the
softly
waved
brown
hair
the
sweet
serious
brow
the
delicate
refined
face
and
jane
bristol
lifted
two
earnest
eyes
and
looked
at
julia
cloud
then
between
them
flashed
a
look
of
understanding
and
sympathy
and
each
knew
at
once
that
she
liked
the
other
is
she
a
dear
cloudy
jewel
demanded
leslie
she
is
responded
julia
cloud
and
put
her
arms
softly
around
the
slender
shoulders
then
she
looked
up
to
see
the
eyes
of
allison
resting
upon
them
with
satisfaction
they
turned
down
the
light
and
sat
before
the
fire
for
a
little
while
telling
about
the
success
of
the
evening
and
talking
of
this
and
that
just
getting
acquainted
and
when
they
finally
took
jane
bristol
up
to
the
pretty
it
was
with
a
sense
that
a
new
and
lasting
friendship
had
been
well
begun
julia
cloud
as
she
lay
down
to
sleep
found
herself
wondering
whether
her
children
would
always
show
so
much
good
sense
in
picking
out
their
friends
as
they
had
done
this
time
chapter
xvii
the
day
when
college
opened
was
a
great
day
the
children
could
hardly
eat
any
breakfast
and
allison
gave
leslie
a
great
many
edifying
instructions
about
registering
now
kid
if
you
get
stuck
for
anything
just
you
hunt
me
up
see
that
you
get
straightened
out
if
you
and
jane
bristol
could
only
get
together
you
could
help
each
other
a
lot
i
get
some
dope
from
some
of
the
fellows
that
the
advantage
i
get
from
finding
a
chapter
of
my
frat
here
they
put
me
wise
as
to
the
best
and
you
stick
around
near
the
entrance
till
i
give
you
the
right
dope
it
does
pay
to
get
started
wrong
in
college
leslie
meekly
accepted
all
these
admonitions
and
they
started
off
together
in
the
car
with
an
abstracted
wave
of
to
julia
cloud
who
somehow
felt
suddenly
left
out
of
the
universe
to
have
her
two
children
suddenly
withdrawn
by
the
power
of
a
great
educational
institution
and
swept
beyond
her
horizon
was
disconcerting
she
had
not
imagined
she
would
feel
this
way
she
stood
in
the
window
watching
them
and
wiped
away
a
furtive
tear
and
then
laughed
to
herself
old
fool
she
said
softly
to
the
the
trouble
with
you
is
you
like
to
be
going
to
college
yourself
and
you
know
it
now
put
this
out
of
your
mind
and
go
to
work
planning
how
to
make
home
doubly
attractive
when
they
get
back
so
that
they
will
want
to
spend
every
minute
possible
here
instead
of
being
drawn
away
from
it
they
love
it
now
keep
them
loving
it
that
your
job
when
the
two
came
back
at
noon
they
were
radiant
and
enthusiastic
as
usual
albeit
they
had
many
a
growl
to
express
one
would
have
thought
to
hear
allison
that
he
had
been
running
colleges
for
some
fifty
years
the
way
he
criticized
the
policy
and
told
how
things
ought
to
be
run
at
first
julia
cloud
was
greatly
distressed
by
it
all
thinking
that
they
surely
had
made
a
mistake
in
their
selection
of
a
college
but
it
gradually
dawned
upon
her
that
this
was
a
sort
of
superior
attitude
maintained
by
men
toward
all
institutions
of
learning
particularly
those
in
which
they
happened
to
be
studying
that
it
was
really
only
an
indication
of
growing
developing
minds
keen
to
see
mistakes
and
trying
to
think
out
remedies
and
as
yet
inexperienced
enough
to
think
they
could
remedy
the
whole
sick
world
the
opening
days
of
college
were
turbulent
days
for
julia
cloud
her
children
were
so
excited
they
could
neither
eat
nor
sleep
they
were
liable
to
turn
up
unexpectedly
at
almost
any
hour
of
the
morning
or
afternoon
hungry
as
bears
and
always
in
a
hurry
they
had
so
many
new
things
to
tell
her
about
and
no
time
in
which
to
talk
they
mixed
things
terribly
and
gave
her
impressions
that
took
months
to
right
and
they
could
not
understand
why
she
looked
distressed
at
their
flightiness
they
were
both
taken
up
eagerly
by
the
students
and
invited
hither
and
yon
by
the
various
groups
and
societies
which
frequently
caused
them
to
be
absent
from
meals
while
they
were
being
dined
and
lunched
and
breakfasted
of
course
julia
cloud
reflected
two
such
young
people
with
a
home
in
the
town
where
they
could
invite
people
a
car
in
which
to
take
friends
out
and
a
free
hand
with
money
would
be
popular
anywhere
her
anxiety
grew
as
the
first
week
waxed
toward
its
end
and
finished
up
saturday
night
with
invitations
to
two
dances
and
one
party
at
a
country
house
ten
miles
away
leslie
rushed
in
breathless
about
six
saturday
evening
and
declared
she
was
too
much
in
a
hurry
to
eat
anything
she
must
get
dressed
at
once
and
put
some
things
in
her
bag
she
rattled
on
about
the
different
social
functions
she
was
expected
to
attend
that
evening
until
julia
cloud
was
in
hopeless
confusion
and
could
only
stand
and
listen
and
try
to
find
the
things
that
leslie
in
her
hurry
had
overlooked
then
allison
arrived
and
wanted
some
supper
he
talked
with
his
mouth
full
about
where
he
was
going
and
what
he
was
going
to
do
and
at
the
end
of
an
hour
and
a
half
julia
cloud
had
a
very
indefinite
idea
of
anything
she
had
a
swift
mental
vision
of
church
and
sabbath
and
christian
endeavor
all
slipping
slowly
out
of
their
calculation
and
the
world
in
large
letters
taking
the
forefront
of
their
vision
you
are
going
to
a
dance
she
said
in
a
white
stricken
way
she
had
when
an
anxiety
first
bewildered
her
to
dances
o
my
dear
leslie
you
then
i
had
thought
of
that
sure
i
dance
said
leslie
gayly
drawing
up
the
delicate
silk
stocking
over
her
slim
ankles
and
slipping
on
a
silver
slipper
you
ought
to
see
me
and
allison
can
dance
too
we
show
you
sometime
do
you
like
dancing
cloudy
why
cloudy
you
could
mean
you
do
approve
of
dancing
not
but
where
would
we
be
dances
why
there
would
be
anything
else
to
do
when
young
people
went
out
oh
do
you
suppose
cherry
would
press
out
this
skirt
a
little
bit
it
got
horribly
mussed
in
that
drawer
julia
cloud
had
dropped
into
a
chair
with
an
feeling
and
a
lightness
in
the
top
of
her
head
she
felt
as
if
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
had
suddenly
dropped
down
upon
the
house
and
were
carrying
off
her
children
bodily
and
she
was
powerless
to
prevent
it
she
could
not
keep
the
pain
of
it
out
of
her
eyes
yet
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
in
this
emergency
none
of
the
things
that
had
always
seemed
entirely
convincing
in
forming
her
own
opinions
seemed
adequate
to
the
occasion
leslie
turned
suddenly
and
saw
her
stricken
face
what
the
matter
cloudy
is
something
wrong
are
you
well
you
like
me
to
go
to
a
dance
why
cloudy
do
you
really
i
have
no
right
to
object
i
suppose
dear
she
said
trying
to
speak
calmly
but
leslie
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
you
dancing
not
nice
it
too
too
intimate
my
little
flower
of
a
girl
oh
but
we
have
to
dance
cloudy
that
ridiculous
and
you
used
to
dances
or
you
would
say
so
ca
you
trust
me
to
be
perfectly
nice
julia
cloud
shuddered
and
went
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
to
answer
a
question
allison
was
calling
up
to
her
and
when
she
came
back
she
said
no
more
about
it
the
pain
was
too
great
and
she
felt
too
bewildered
for
argument
leslie
was
enveloped
in
tulle
with
touches
of
silver
and
looked
like
a
young
goddess
with
straps
of
silver
over
her
slim
shoulders
and
a
thread
of
pearls
about
her
throat
the
white
neck
and
back
that
the
wisp
of
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
were
very
beautiful
and
quite
childish
but
they
shocked
the
sweet
soul
of
julia
cloud
inexpressibly
she
stood
aghast
when
leslie
whirled
upon
her
and
demanded
to
know
how
she
liked
the
gown
o
my
dear
gasped
her
aunt
you
not
going
out
before
people
all
undressed
like
that
leslie
gave
her
one
glance
of
hurt
dismay
whirled
back
to
her
glass
and
examined
herself
critically
why
cloudy
her
voice
was
almost
trembling
and
her
cheeks
were
rosier
than
the
tulle
with
disappointment
why
cloudy
i
thought
it
was
lovely
it
just
like
everybody
else
i
thought
you
would
think
i
looked
the
child
drooped
and
julia
cloud
went
up
to
her
gently
it
is
beautiful
darling
and
you
are
exquisite
but
dear
it
seems
terrible
for
my
little
girl
to
go
among
young
men
so
sort
of
nakedly
i
sure
if
you
understood
life
better
you
would
do
it
you
are
tempting
men
to
wrong
thoughts
undressed
that
way
and
you
are
putting
on
common
view
the
intimate
loveliness
of
the
body
god
gave
you
to
keep
holy
and
pure
it
is
the
way
cheap
women
have
of
making
many
men
love
them
in
a
careless
physical
way
i
do
know
how
to
tell
you
but
it
seems
terrible
to
me
if
you
were
my
own
little
girl
i
never
would
be
willing
to
have
you
go
out
that
way
you
said
enough
almost
screamed
leslie
with
a
sudden
frenzy
of
rage
shame
and
disappointment
i
feel
as
if
i
never
could
look
anybody
in
the
face
again
and
with
a
cry
she
flung
herself
into
the
jumble
of
bright
garments
on
her
bed
and
wept
as
if
her
heart
would
break
julia
cloud
stood
over
her
in
consternation
and
tried
to
soothe
her
but
nothing
did
any
good
the
young
storm
had
to
have
its
way
and
the
slim
pink
shoulders
shook
in
convulsive
sobs
while
the
dismayed
elder
sat
down
beside
the
bed
with
troubled
eyes
upon
her
and
waited
praying
quietly
in
the
midst
of
it
all
allison
appeared
at
the
door
what
in
thunder
is
the
matter
i
yelled
my
head
off
and
nobody
answers
what
is
the
matter
with
you
kid
it
time
we
started
and
you
doing
the
baby
act
i
never
thought
you
get
hystericky
leslie
lifted
a
wet
and
smeary
face
out
of
her
pillow
and
addressed
her
brother
defiantly
i
good
reason
to
cry
she
said
cloudy
thinks
i
not
decent
to
go
out
in
this
dress
and
she
wo
believe
everybody
dresses
this
way
and
i
i
going
again
and
down
went
her
head
in
the
pillow
again
with
another
long
convulsive
sob
her
brother
strode
over
to
her
and
lifted
her
up
firmly
but
gently
there
kid
quit
your
crying
and
be
sensible
stand
up
and
let
look
at
you
he
stood
her
upon
her
feet
and
she
swayed
there
quivering
half
ashamed
her
hands
to
her
face
her
pink
shoulders
heaving
and
her
soft
pink
chest
quivering
with
sobs
while
he
surveyed
her
well
kid
i
must
say
i
agree
with
cloudy
he
said
half
reluctantly
at
last
the
dress
is
a
peach
of
course
and
you
look
like
an
angel
in
it
but
if
you
could
hear
the
rotten
things
the
fellows
say
about
the
way
the
girls
dress
you
would
want
to
go
that
way
and
i
do
want
them
to
talk
that
way
about
my
sister
could
you
stick
in
a
towel
or
an
apron
or
something
and
make
a
little
more
waist
to
the
thing
i
sure
you
look
just
as
pretty
and
the
fellows
would
think
you
a
whole
lot
nicer
girl
i
do
want
you
to
get
the
nickname
of
the
freshman
vamp
i
could
stand
for
that
poor
leslie
sank
into
a
chair
and
covered
her
face
for
another
cry
declaring
it
was
no
use
it
would
utterly
spoil
the
dress
to
do
anything
to
it
and
she
could
go
and
would
go
and
wear
it
but
at
last
julia
cloud
came
to
the
rescue
with
needle
and
thread
and
soft
rose
drapery
made
from
a
scarf
of
leslie
that
exactly
matched
the
dress
and
presently
she
stood
meek
and
sweet
and
quite
modest
blooming
prettily
out
of
her
pink
misty
garments
like
an
opening
in
spite
of
her
recent
tears
but
when
are
you
coming
back
asked
julia
cloud
in
sudden
dismay
her
troubles
returning
in
full
force
as
she
watched
them
going
out
the
door
to
the
car
allison
carrying
two
bags
and
telling
leslie
to
hurry
for
all
she
was
worth
the
two
children
turned
then
and
faced
their
aunt
with
a
swift
comprehending
vision
of
what
this
expedition
of
theirs
meant
to
her
it
had
not
occurred
to
them
before
that
they
were
deliberately
planning
to
spend
most
of
the
night
saturday
night
in
mirth
and
stay
over
sunday
at
a
where
the
sabbath
would
be
as
a
thing
unknown
nobody
had
ever
talked
to
them
about
these
things
before
they
had
accepted
it
as
a
part
of
the
world
of
society
into
which
they
had
been
born
and
they
had
never
questioned
it
they
were
impatient
now
that
their
tried
and
true
friend
and
comrade
did
not
comprehend
that
this
occasion
was
different
from
most
and
that
it
must
be
an
exception
they
were
willing
to
keep
the
sabbath
in
general
but
in
this
particular
they
felt
they
must
not
be
hampered
the
whole
idea
shone
plainly
in
their
faces
and
the
pain
and
disappointment
and
chagrin
shone
clearly
emphatically
in
julia
cloud
eyes
as
she
faced
them
and
read
the
truth
why
we
do
know
just
for
sure
cloudy
allison
tried
to
temporize
you
see
they
usually
dance
to
all
hours
it
saturday
night
and
no
classes
and
this
is
an
unusual
occasion
a
party
you
know
then
you
wo
be
back
you
are
not
going
to
church
you
will
spend
the
sabbath
at
a
party
she
said
these
things
as
if
she
were
telling
them
to
herself
so
that
she
could
better
take
in
the
facts
and
not
cry
out
with
the
disappointment
of
it
there
was
no
quality
of
in
her
tone
but
the
pain
of
her
voice
cut
to
the
heart
the
two
young
culprits
therefore
according
to
the
code
of
loving
human
nature
they
got
angry
why
of
course
chirped
leslie
did
you
expect
that
that
what
parties
are
oh
cut
this
out
leslie
cried
allison
we
got
ta
beat
it
way
late
now
cloudy
you
can
expect
us
when
we
get
here
do
bother
about
anything
there
no
need
to
we
telephone
you
later
when
we
expect
to
come
back
nightie
nightie
cloudy
you
go
rest
yourself
you
look
tired
he
gave
her
a
hurried
deprecatory
kiss
and
swept
his
sister
out
into
the
night
julia
cloud
heard
the
purring
of
the
engine
saw
the
lights
of
the
car
glide
away
from
the
door
down
the
street
and
out
of
sight
they
were
gone
she
felt
as
though
a
piece
of
herself
had
been
torn
away
from
her
and
flung
out
for
the
world
to
trample
upon
for
a
long
time
she
stood
staring
from
the
window
into
the
darkness
unshed
tears
burning
behind
her
eyes
and
throat
trying
to
steady
the
beating
of
her
heart
and
get
used
to
the
gnawing
trouble
that
somehow
made
her
feel
faint
and
weak
it
came
over
her
that
she
had
been
a
fool
to
attempt
to
fill
the
place
of
mother
to
these
two
modern
young
things
their
own
ideas
were
fully
made
up
about
all
questions
that
seemed
vital
to
her
she
had
been
a
fossil
in
a
place
all
her
life
and
of
course
they
felt
she
did
not
know
well
of
course
she
did
not
know
much
about
modern
society
and
its
ways
save
to
dread
it
and
to
doubt
it
and
to
wish
to
keep
them
away
from
it
she
was
prejudiced
perhaps
yes
she
had
been
reared
that
way
and
the
world
would
call
her
narrow
would
christ
the
lord
feel
that
way
about
it
did
he
like
to
have
his
children
dressing
like
abandoned
women
and
making
free
with
one
another
under
the
guise
of
polite
social
customs
did
he
want
his
children
to
spend
their
sabbaths
in
play
however
innocent
the
play
might
be
she
turned
with
a
sigh
away
from
the
window
no
she
could
not
see
it
any
other
way
it
was
the
way
of
the
world
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
leslie
had
made
it
plain
when
she
said
they
had
to
do
it
or
be
left
out
and
was
that
just
what
it
meant
to
be
a
peculiar
people
unto
the
lord
to
be
willing
to
give
up
doubtful
things
that
harmed
people
for
the
sake
of
keeping
pure
and
unspotted
from
the
world
if
ye
were
of
the
world
the
world
would
love
its
own
but
because
i
have
chosen
you
out
of
the
world
therefore
the
world
hateth
you
came
the
familiar
old
words
well
and
what
should
she
do
now
it
would
do
to
rave
and
fuss
about
things
that
never
did
any
good
she
could
say
she
would
stay
if
they
danced
and
went
away
over
the
sabbath
those
were
things
in
which
she
might
advise
but
had
no
authority
they
were
old
enough
to
decide
such
matters
for
themselves
she
could
only
use
her
influence
and
trust
the
rest
with
the
lord
yes
there
was
one
thing
she
could
do
she
could
pray
so
julia
cloud
gave
her
quiet
orders
to
cherry
and
went
up
to
her
room
to
kneel
by
the
bed
and
pray
agonizing
for
her
beloved
children
through
the
long
hours
of
that
long
long
evening
it
was
a
quiet
face
that
she
lifted
at
last
from
her
vigil
for
it
bore
the
brightness
of
a
communion
with
her
lord
and
she
rose
and
went
about
her
preparations
for
the
night
then
just
as
she
had
taken
down
her
hair
and
was
brushing
it
in
a
silver
cloud
about
her
shoulders
she
heard
a
car
drive
up
a
moment
more
a
key
turned
in
the
latch
and
some
one
came
in
julia
cloud
stood
with
the
poised
down
a
strand
of
hair
and
listened
yes
the
car
had
gone
on
to
the
garage
what
could
have
happened
chapter
xviii
it
was
all
still
below
stairs
then
a
soft
stealthy
silken
movement
cautiously
coming
up
the
stairs
julia
cloud
went
quickly
to
the
hall
door
and
switched
on
the
light
on
the
landing
stood
leslie
lovely
and
flushed
with
her
hair
slightly
ruffled
and
her
velvet
evening
cloak
thrown
back
showing
the
rosy
mist
of
her
dress
she
stood
with
one
silver
slipper
poised
on
the
stairs
a
sweet
guilty
look
on
her
face
o
cloudy
i
thought
you
were
asleep
and
i
did
want
to
waken
you
she
said
penitently
but
you
have
gone
to
bed
yet
have
you
glad
we
wanted
you
to
know
we
were
home
is
anything
the
matter
julia
cloud
asked
with
a
stricture
of
emotion
in
her
throat
no
only
we
got
tired
and
we
did
want
to
stay
to
their
old
party
anyway
and
we
rather
be
home
leslie
sprang
up
the
stairs
and
caught
her
aunt
in
her
arms
with
one
of
her
sweet
violent
kisses
o
my
dear
was
all
julia
cloud
could
say
and
then
they
heard
allison
closing
the
door
softly
below
and
creaking
across
the
floor
and
up
the
stairs
oh
you
waked
her
up
he
said
reproachfully
as
he
caught
sight
of
his
sister
in
julia
cloud
arms
no
you
wrong
she
had
even
gone
to
bed
yet
i
knew
she
would
said
leslie
nestling
closer
say
cloudy
we
not
going
to
trouble
you
that
way
again
it
is
worth
it
we
do
like
their
old
dancing
anyway
i
could
forget
the
way
you
looked
so
hurt
and
the
things
you
said
wo
you
please
come
down
to
the
fire
awhile
we
want
to
tell
you
about
it
down
on
the
couch
with
allison
stirring
up
the
dying
embers
and
leslie
nestled
close
to
her
julia
cloud
heard
bits
about
the
evening
it
was
bad
cloudy
it
was
they
dance
a
lot
nicer
in
colleges
than
they
do
other
places
i
know
for
i
been
to
lots
of
dances
and
i
never
let
men
get
too
familiar
allison
taught
me
that
when
i
was
little
that
why
what
you
said
made
me
so
mad
always
been
a
lot
carefuller
than
you
think
and
i
never
dance
with
anybody
the
second
time
if
i
do
like
the
way
he
does
it
the
first
time
and
everybody
was
real
nice
and
dignified
cloudy
the
boys
are
all
shy
and
bashful
anyway
only
i
could
forget
what
you
had
said
about
not
liking
to
have
me
do
it
and
it
made
everything
seem
so
so
well
not
nice
and
i
just
felt
uncomfortable
and
one
dance
i
sent
the
boy
for
a
glass
of
water
for
me
and
i
just
sat
it
out
and
when
allison
saw
me
he
came
over
and
said
beat
it
and
so
i
slipped
up
to
the
and
got
my
cloak
and
we
just
ran
away
without
telling
anybody
was
that
perfectly
dreadful
but
i
call
the
girl
up
after
a
while
and
tell
her
we
had
to
come
home
and
we
did
want
to
spoil
their
fun
telling
them
so
they
sat
for
an
hour
talking
before
the
fire
the
young
people
telling
her
all
about
their
experiences
of
the
last
few
days
and
letting
her
into
their
lives
again
with
the
old
sweet
relation
then
they
drifted
back
again
to
the
subject
of
dancing
i
do
give
a
whoop
whether
i
dance
or
not
cloudy
said
allison
i
never
did
care
much
about
it
and
i
do
see
having
my
sister
dance
with
some
fellows
either
only
it
does
cut
you
out
of
lots
of
fun
and
you
get
in
bad
with
everybody
if
you
do
do
it
i
expected
we
have
to
have
dances
here
at
the
house
too
sometimes
but
if
you
do
like
it
we
wo
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
well
dear
that
beautiful
of
you
of
course
i
could
allow
you
to
let
me
upset
your
life
and
spoil
all
your
pleasure
but
wondering
if
we
could
try
an
experiment
it
seems
to
me
there
ought
to
be
things
that
people
would
enjoy
as
much
as
dancing
and
why
could
we
find
enough
of
them
to
fill
up
the
evenings
and
make
them
forget
about
the
dancing
there
be
some
that
wo
come
of
course
said
leslie
but
we
should
worry
they
wo
be
the
kind
we
like
anyway
jane
bristol
does
dance
she
told
me
so
yesterday
she
said
her
mother
never
did
and
brought
her
up
to
feel
that
she
did
want
to
either
she
some
girl
said
allison
irrelevantly
she
entered
the
sophomore
class
with
credits
she
got
for
studying
in
the
summer
school
and
some
did
you
know
that
kid
i
was
in
the
office
when
she
came
in
for
her
card
and
i
heard
the
profs
talking
about
her
and
saying
she
had
some
bean
those
chumps
in
the
village
will
find
out
some
day
that
the
girl
they
despised
is
worth
more
than
the
whole
lot
of
them
put
together
julia
cloud
leaned
forward
and
touched
lightly
and
affectionately
the
hair
that
waved
back
from
the
boy
forehead
and
spoke
tenderly
dear
boy
i
not
forget
your
leaving
your
friends
and
coming
back
to
me
and
to
the
sabbath
and
church
and
all
that
it
means
a
lot
to
me
to
have
my
children
observe
those
things
i
hope
some
day
you
do
it
because
you
feel
you
want
to
please
god
instead
of
me
sure
said
allison
trying
not
to
look
embarrassed
i
guess
maybe
i
care
about
that
too
a
little
bit
to
tell
the
truth
cloudy
i
could
see
staying
away
from
that
christian
endeavor
meeting
after
i
worked
hard
all
the
week
to
get
people
to
come
to
it
it
seem
square
the
moment
was
tense
with
deep
feeling
and
julia
cloud
could
not
bring
herself
to
break
it
by
words
she
brought
the
boy
hand
up
to
her
lips
and
pressed
it
close
and
then
just
as
she
was
about
to
speak
the
telephone
rang
sharply
again
and
again
allison
sprang
up
and
went
to
answer
hello
yes
oh
miss
bristol
what
are
you
sure
i
be
there
at
once
lock
yourself
in
your
room
till
i
get
there
he
hung
up
the
receiver
excitedly
call
up
the
fire
department
quick
leslie
tell
them
to
hurry
there
some
one
breaking
into
the
johnson
house
and
jane
bristol
is
there
alone
with
the
children
it
park
avenue
you
know
hustle
he
was
out
the
door
before
they
could
exclaim
and
leslie
hastened
to
the
telephone
he
went
without
his
overcoat
said
julia
cloud
hurrying
to
the
closet
for
it
it
will
be
very
cold
riding
he
ought
to
have
it
leslie
hung
up
the
receiver
and
flung
her
velvet
cloak
about
her
hurriedly
grabbing
the
overcoat
give
it
to
me
cloudy
i
going
with
him
she
cried
and
dashed
out
the
door
as
the
car
slid
out
of
the
garage
o
leslie
child
you
to
go
she
cried
rushing
to
the
door
but
leslie
was
already
climbing
into
the
car
moving
as
it
was
it
all
right
cloudy
she
called
there
a
revolver
in
the
car
you
know
and
the
car
whirled
away
down
the
street
julia
cloud
stood
gasping
after
them
the
horrible
thought
of
a
revolver
in
the
car
did
not
cheer
her
as
leslie
had
evidently
hoped
it
would
what
children
they
were
after
all
plunging
her
from
one
trouble
into
another
yet
what
dear
loving
children
she
went
in
and
found
a
heavy
cloak
and
went
out
again
to
listen
then
it
came
to
her
that
perhaps
leslie
had
not
made
the
operator
understand
so
she
went
back
to
the
telephone
to
try
to
find
out
whether
any
one
had
been
sent
suppose
those
children
should
try
to
face
a
burglar
alone
there
might
be
more
than
one
for
aught
they
knew
oh
leslie
have
gone
a
terrible
anxiety
took
possession
of
her
and
she
tried
to
pray
as
she
worked
the
telephone
hook
up
and
down
and
waited
for
the
operator
then
into
the
quiet
of
the
night
there
came
the
loud
clang
of
the
and
a
moment
later
hurried
calls
and
voices
in
the
distance
sounding
through
the
front
door
that
julia
cloud
had
left
open
for
an
instant
she
was
relieved
and
then
she
reflected
that
this
might
be
a
fire
somewhere
else
and
not
the
call
for
the
johnson
house
at
all
so
she
kept
on
trying
to
call
the
operator
at
last
a
snappy
voice
snarled
into
her
ear
we
do
tell
where
the
fire
is
we
not
allowed
any
more
and
snap
the
operator
was
gone
again
but
i
do
want
to
know
where
the
fire
is
called
julia
cloud
in
dismay
i
want
to
ask
a
question
no
answer
came
and
the
dim
buzz
of
the
wire
sounded
emptily
back
to
her
anxious
ear
at
last
she
gave
it
up
and
went
out
to
the
street
to
look
up
and
down
if
she
only
knew
which
way
was
park
avenue
she
could
hear
the
engine
now
clattering
along
with
the
hook
and
ladder
behind
and
dark
hurrying
forms
crossed
the
street
just
beyond
the
next
corner
but
no
one
came
by
she
hurried
out
to
the
corner
and
called
to
a
boy
who
was
passing
and
he
yelled
out
do
know
lady
up
park
avenue
somewhere
then
the
street
grew
very
quiet
again
and
all
the
noise
centred
away
in
the
distance
a
shot
rang
out
and
voices
shouted
and
her
heart
beat
so
loud
she
could
hear
it
she
hurried
back
to
the
house
again
and
tried
to
get
the
telephone
operator
but
nothing
came
of
it
and
for
the
next
twenty
minutes
she
vibrated
between
the
street
and
the
telephone
and
wondered
whether
she
ought
not
to
wake
up
cherry
and
do
something
else
it
seemed
perfectly
terrible
to
think
of
those
two
children
handling
a
burglar
alone
and
yet
what
could
she
do
pretty
soon
however
she
heard
the
returning
with
the
crowd
and
she
hurried
down
to
the
corner
to
find
out
it
was
no
fire
at
all
lady
answered
a
boy
whom
she
questioned
it
was
just
two
men
breakin
into
a
house
but
they
ketched
both
an
are
takin
down
to
the
lockup
no
lady
there
was
nobody
killed
there
was
some
shootin
sure
a
girl
done
it
some
college
girl
in
a
car
she
see
the
guy
comin
to
make
a
in
her
car
see
and
she
let
go
at
him
and
picked
him
off
the
first
call
got
him
through
the
knee
an
by
that
time
the
fire
got
there
and
cinched
both
she
some
girl
she
is
julia
cloud
felt
her
head
whirling
and
hurried
back
to
the
house
to
sit
down
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
was
it
leslie
who
had
shot
the
burglar
leslie
her
little
butterfly
who
seemed
so
much
like
a
baby
yet
in
many
ways
oh
what
a
horrible
danger
she
had
escaped
if
she
had
escaped
perhaps
the
boy
did
not
know
oh
if
they
would
but
come
it
seemed
hours
since
they
had
left
the
midnight
train
was
just
pulling
into
the
station
how
exasperating
that
the
telephone
did
not
respond
something
must
be
out
of
order
with
it
hark
was
that
the
car
it
surely
was
chapter
xix
how
welcome
a
sound
was
the
churn
of
the
engine
as
it
came
flying
up
the
road
and
turned
into
the
driveway
julia
cloud
was
at
the
door
waiting
to
receive
them
straining
her
eyes
into
the
darkness
to
be
sure
they
were
both
there
leslie
sprang
out
and
dashed
into
her
arms
o
cloudy
you
waited
up
did
you
we
thought
you
must
be
asleep
and
did
hear
the
telephone
we
tried
to
call
you
up
and
explain
you
see
jane
was
there
alone
and
of
course
she
did
much
enjoy
staying
after
what
had
happened
so
we
waited
till
the
johnsons
got
back
from
the
city
they
had
been
to
the
theatre
and
they
just
came
on
that
midnight
train
if
i
lived
in
a
lonely
place
like
that
i
would
leave
three
babies
with
a
young
girl
all
alone
in
the
house
it
seems
the
servants
were
all
away
or
left
or
something
i
guess
they
were
pretty
scared
when
they
got
back
i
wanted
to
bring
the
children
up
here
to
stay
all
night
with
us
and
let
them
scared
when
they
got
home
but
she
would
of
course
so
we
stayed
with
her
leslie
tossed
aside
her
velvet
cloak
as
she
talked
it
was
awfully
exciting
cloudy
i
glad
i
went
there
no
telling
what
might
have
happened
to
allison
if
somebody
had
been
there
you
see
he
shut
down
the
motor
as
we
came
up
to
the
house
we
been
going
like
a
streak
of
lightning
all
the
way
and
we
tried
to
sneak
up
so
they
would
hear
us
and
get
away
but
there
was
one
man
outside
on
the
watch
and
he
gave
the
word
and
just
as
allison
got
out
of
the
car
he
disappeared
into
the
shadows
the
other
one
came
piling
out
of
a
window
and
streaked
it
across
the
porch
and
down
the
lawn
allison
made
for
him
but
he
changed
his
course
and
came
straight
toward
the
car
i
guess
they
thought
it
was
empty
and
then
the
other
one
came
flying
out
from
behind
the
bushes
and
made
for
allison
so
i
just
leaned
out
of
the
car
and
shot
i
do
know
how
i
ever
had
the
nerve
for
i
was
terribly
frightened
but
he
would
have
got
allison
in
another
minute
and
allison
did
see
him
coming
he
had
a
big
club
in
his
hand
i
saw
it
as
he
went
across
in
front
of
the
window
and
i
knew
i
must
do
something
so
i
aimed
right
in
front
of
him
and
i
saw
him
go
down
on
his
knees
and
throw
up
his
hands
and
then
i
felt
sick
and
began
to
think
what
if
i
had
killed
him
i
did
cloudy
they
say
i
only
hit
his
knee
but
would
it
have
been
awful
all
my
life
to
have
to
think
i
had
killed
a
man
i
could
have
stood
it
cloudy
and
with
sudden
breaking
of
the
tension
the
child
flung
herself
down
in
a
little
brilliant
heap
at
julia
cloud
knees
buried
her
bright
face
in
her
aunt
lap
and
burst
into
tears
you
brave
little
darling
julia
cloud
caressed
her
and
folded
her
arms
about
her
she
all
of
that
cloudy
she
saved
my
life
it
was
allison
who
spoke
standing
tall
and
proud
above
his
sister
and
looking
down
at
her
tenderly
come
now
kiddie
do
give
way
when
you
been
such
a
trump
i
knew
you
could
shoot
but
i
did
think
you
could
keep
your
head
like
that
cloudy
she
was
a
little
winner
the
cool
way
she
aimed
at
that
man
with
the
other
one
coming
right
toward
her
and
meaning
plainly
to
get
in
the
car
and
run
away
in
it
he
have
taken
her
too
of
course
and
stopped
at
nothing
to
get
away
but
when
he
saw
the
good
shot
she
was
and
heard
his
pal
groaning
he
threw
up
his
hands
and
turned
sharp
about
for
me
he
knew
it
was
his
only
chance
and
that
whoever
was
shooting
would
shoot
at
him
while
he
was
all
tangled
up
with
me
so
he
made
a
spring
at
me
before
i
knew
what
he
was
doing
and
threw
me
off
my
feet
and
got
a
half
nelson
on
me
you
know
yes
cloudy
he
was
fiendish
and
i
could
do
a
thing
for
fear
of
hitting
allison
and
just
then
i
heard
a
chugging
by
the
car
i
had
heard
it
before
there
was
so
much
going
on
and
a
big
strong
fellow
with
his
hair
all
standing
up
in
the
wind
jumped
off
and
ran
toward
them
where
they
were
rolling
on
the
ground
then
i
thought
of
the
and
turned
it
on
them
and
that
man
saw
just
how
things
were
and
he
jumped
in
and
grabbed
the
burglar
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
yard
was
full
of
men
and
boys
and
a
terrible
noise
and
clanging
and
the
and
hook
and
ladder
came
rushing
up
cloudy
you
did
tell
them
there
was
a
fire
did
you
i
did
i
told
that
telephone
girl
there
was
a
burglar
and
to
send
a
policeman
but
somehow
she
got
it
that
the
house
was
on
fire
and
jane
bristol
was
in
the
house
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
and
the
other
little
children
asleep
in
their
cribs
and
she
did
know
what
was
happening
because
she
did
dare
to
open
the
window
into
the
midst
of
the
excitement
and
explanations
there
came
a
loud
knock
on
the
door
and
allison
sprang
up
and
went
to
see
who
was
there
a
young
man
with
dishevelled
garments
hair
standing
on
end
and
face
much
streaked
with
mud
and
dust
stood
there
a
leaned
against
the
end
of
the
porch
pardon
me
he
said
half
shyly
i
saw
the
light
and
thought
some
one
was
up
yet
did
the
lady
drop
this
i
found
it
in
the
grass
when
i
went
back
to
hunt
for
my
it
was
right
where
she
stood
he
held
forth
his
hand
and
there
dropped
from
his
fingers
a
slender
white
gleaming
thing
allison
flashed
on
the
and
looked
at
it
leslie
is
this
yours
the
man
looked
up
and
there
stood
the
princess
her
rosy
garments
like
the
mist
of
dawn
glowing
in
the
light
of
fire
and
lamp
her
tumbled
golden
curls
her
eyes
bright
with
recent
tears
her
cheeks
pink
with
excitement
he
had
seen
her
dimly
a
little
while
before
in
a
long
velvet
cloak
and
a
little
concealing
standing
in
a
shooting
with
a
steady
hand
and
again
coming
with
swift
feet
to
her
brother
side
in
the
grass
after
he
was
released
from
the
burglar
hold
but
he
had
not
caught
the
look
of
her
face
now
he
stood
speechless
and
stared
at
the
lovely
apparition
was
it
possible
that
this
lovely
child
had
been
the
cool
brave
girl
in
the
car
leslie
had
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
with
a
quick
cry
and
found
it
bare
my
string
of
pearls
she
said
how
careless
of
me
not
to
have
noticed
they
were
gone
i
so
glad
you
found
them
they
are
the
ones
that
mamma
used
to
have
then
looking
up
for
the
first
time
she
said
oh

are
the
young
man
who
saved
my
brother
life
wo

i
think

the
young
man
but
allison

out
a
firm
arm
and
pulled
him
in
shutting
the
door
behind
him
cloudy
he
said
turning
to
his
aunt

man
came
in
the
nick
of
time
and
saved
me
just
as
i
was
getting
woosey
that
fellow
sure
had
a
grip
on
my
throat
and
something
had
hit
my
head
and
taken
away
all
the
sense
i
had
so
i
could
seem
to
get
him
off
that
all
right
i
noticed
you
were
holding
your
own
put
in
the
stranger
it
is
every
man
would
have
tackled
two
unknown
burglars
alone
he
spoke
in
a
voice
of
deep
admiration
well
i
noticed
you
were
the
only
man
on
the
spot
till

this
winter

may
get
back
to
college
next
fall
i
was
a
junior
last
year
but
i
could
quite
make
the
financial
part
so
i
had
to
go
to
work
again
there
was
a
defiance
in
his
tone
as
he
told
it
as
if
he
had
said
now
perhaps
you
wo
want
to
know
me
and
he
had
not
taken
the
offered
chair
but
was
standing
as
if
he
would
not
take
their
friendship
under
false
pretences
but
trust
allison
to
say
the
graceful
thing
i
somehow
felt
you
were
my
superior
he
said
with
his
eyes
full
of
real
friendship
sit
down
just
a
minute
so
we
can
be
sure
you
really
mean
to
come
again
yes

sit
down
said
julia
cloud
i
was
just
going
to
get
these
children
a
bite
to
eat
and
i
sure
they
like
to
have
you
share
it
with
them
it
a
long
time
since
supper
and
you
have
been
through
a
good
deal
are
you
hungry
the
wo
be
open
this
time
of
night
she
smiled
that
welcoming
home
smile
that
no
young
person
could
resist
and
the
young
man
sat
down
with
a
swift
furtive
glance
at
leslie
she
seemed
too
bright
and
wonderful
to
be
true
he
let
his
eyes
wander
about
the
charming
room
the
fire
the
couch
the
lamplight
on
the
books
the
little
home
touches
everywhere
and
then
he
sank
into
the
big
cushions
of
the
chair
gratefully
say
this
is
wonderful
he
said
i
have
known
what
home
was
like
for
seven
years
well
it
almost
that
long
since
we
had
a
real
home
too
said
leslie
gravely
and
we
love
this
one
yes
said
allison
we
just
got
this
home
and
we
sure
do
appreciate
it
i
hope
if
you
like
it
you
often
share
it
with
us
well
i
call
that
generous
to
an
utter
stranger
then
julia
cloud
entered
with
a
tray
and
allison
and
leslie
both
jumped
up
to
help
her
leslie
brought
a
plate
with
wonderful
frosted
cakes
and
little
sandwiches
which
somehow
julia
cloud
always
managed
to
have
just
ready
to
serve
allison
passed
the
cups
of
hot
chocolate
with
billows
of
whipped
cream
on
the
top
and
they
all
sat
down
before
the
fire
to
eat
in
the
coziest
way
suddenly
right
in
the
midst
of
their
talk
the
big
grandfather
clock
in
the
corner
chimed
softly
out
a
single
clear
reminding
stroke
why
cloudy
it
one
sunday
morning
and
here
we
are
having
a
party
after
all
right
at
home
laughed
leslie
teasingly
the
stranger
stood
up
with
apology
oh
please
do
go
for
a
minute
said
leslie
i
want
you
to
do
one
more
thing
for
me
now
allison
i
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
that
you
mean
to
get
ahead
of
me
but
i
have
first
chance
he
my
find
letchworth
you
do
happen
to
belong
to
a
christian
endeavor
society
anywhere
do
you
the
startled
young
man
shook
his
head
a
look
of
being
on
his
guard
suddenly
coming
into
his
eyes
do
i
look
like
it
he
asked
half
comically
suddenly
glancing
down
at
his
muddy
greasy
garments
and
old
torn
sweater
well
then
i
want
you
to
come
to
the
meeting
night
no
at
seven
down
at
that
little
brick
church
on
the
next
street
everybody
had
to
promise
to
bring
some
one
who
has
never
come
before
and
i
did
have
anybody
to
ask
because
all
the
college
people
i
know
are
off
at
a
and
i
ran
away
from
it
and
came
home
so
i
could
very
well
ask
them
will
you
go
the
young
man
looked
at
the
lovely
girl
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
that
might
easily
have
grown
into
a
sneer
and
a
curt
refusal
but
somehow
the
clear
true
look
in
her
eyes
made
refusal
impossible
against
all
his
prejudices
he
hesitated
and
then
suddenly
said
yes
i
go
if
you
want
me
to
i
not
in
the
habit
of
going
to
such
places
but
if
you
want
me
i
go
she
put
her
slim
cool
hand
into
his
and
thanked
him
sweetly
and
he
went
out
into
the
starlight
feeling
as
if
a
princess
had
knighted
him
there
sighed
leslie
as
the
sound
of
his
died
away
in
the
distance
i
think
he
a
real
man
it
queer
but
he
and
jane
bristol
are
the
nicest
people
we
met
in
this
town
yet
and
they
both
work
for
their
living
i
was
just
thinking
that
too
said
allison
vigorously
poking
the
fire
into
a
shower
of
ruby
sparks
do
you
like
him
cloudy
yes
said
julia
cloud
emphatically
he
looks
as
if
he
took
life
in
earnest
but
come
do
you
think
we
better
go
to
bed
so
they
all
lay
down
to
sleep
at
last
julia
cloud
too
profoundly
thankful
for
words
in
the
prayer
her
heart
fervently
breathed
chapter
xx
the
routine
of
college
classes
became
settled
at
last
and
gradually
the
young
people
found
bits
of
leisure
for
the
family
life
which
they
craved
and
loved
allison
came
in
one
day
and
announced
that
he
had
bought
a
canoe
it
a
peach
cloudy
and
i
got
it
cheap
from
a
fellow
that
has
to
leave
college
his
father
has
got
a
job
out
in
california
and
they
are
going
to
move
and
want
to
transfer
him
to
a
western
college
so
he
wo
be
so
far
away
from
them
i
got
it
for
fifteen
dollars
with
all
the
outfit
and
it
only
been
used
one
season
but
he
could
take
it
with
him
there
are
three
paddles
and
two
cushions
and
some
rugs
belonging
to
it
and
i
arranged
to
keep
it
down
behind
the
inn
so
it
wo
be
far
for
us
to
go
to
it
now
i
want
you
to
be
ready
to
take
a
trial
trip
this
afternoon
at
three
when
leslie
and
i
get
through
our
classes
with
much
inward
questioning
but
entire
loyalty
julia
cloud
yielded
herself
to
the
uncertainties
of
canoeing
but
it
needed
but
that
first
trip
to
make
her
an
ardent
admirer
of
that
form
of
recreation
it
really
seemed
to
her
to
be
as
she
sank
among
the
pillows
in
the
comfortable
nest
the
children
had
prepared
for
her
and
felt
herself
glide
out
upon
the
smooth
bosom
of
the
creek
into
the
glow
of
the
autumn
afternoon
for
in
the
shelter
of
the
winding
ravine
where
the
creek
wandered
the
frost
had
not
yet
completed
its
work
and
the
trees
were
still
in
glowing
colors
blending
brilliantly
with
the
dark
green
of
the
hemlock
a
few
stark
trunks
were
bare
and
bleak
against
the
sky
in
unsheltered
places
but
for
the
most
part
the
banks
of
the
creek
still
set
forth
a
most
pleasing
display
to
the
who
chose
to
come
and
see
winding
dark
and
soft
and
still
with
braided
ripples
here
and
there
and
little
floating
brown
leaves
that
slithered
against
the
boat
as
they
passed
the
creek
meandered
between
the
hills
now
turning
almost
upon
itself
around
a
mossy
grassy
stretch
of
skirting
a
or
slipping
beneath
great
rocks
that
cropped
out
on
the
hillside
where
moss
had
crept
in
a
lovely
carpet
and
graceful
hemlocks
found
a
foothold
and
leaned
over
to
dip
in
the
water
and
brush
the
faces
of
those
who
passed
up
up
and
up
through
the
frantic
little
rapids
that
bubbled
and
fought
and
were
conquered
into
the
stiller
waters
above
between
banks
all
dark
and
green
and
quiet
most
brilliantly
and
cunningly
embroidered
with
exquisite
squawberry
vines
and
scarlet
berries
it
was
most
entrancing
and
julia
cloud
was
reluctant
to
come
home
no
need
ever
to
coax
her
any
more
she
was
ready
always
to
go
in
that
canoe
jealous
of
anything
that
prevented
a
chance
to
go
often
she
and
cherry
instead
of
getting
a
hot
lunch
at
home
would
put
up
the
most
delectable
lunch
in
paper
boxes
and
when
the
children
came
home
she
would
be
ready
to
go
right
down
to
the
canoe
and
spend
two
delightful
hours
floating
up
and
down
the
creek
and
eating
an
unconscionable
number
of
sandwiches
and
cakes
this
happened
most
often
on
wednesdays
when
the
children
had
no
classes
from
eleven
until
three
and
there
was
time
to
take
the
noon
hour
in
a
leisurely
way
not
even
cool
weather
coming
on
could
daunt
them
and
warm
sweaters
and
gloves
were
requisitioned
and
the
lunches
went
on
just
the
same
one
day
they
took
a
pot
of
hot
soup
and
three
small
bowls
and
spoons
they
landed
at
the
great
rocks
and
climbing
up
built
a
fire
and
gave
their
soup
another
little
touch
of
heat
before
they
ate
it
such
experiences
welded
their
hearts
more
and
more
together
and
julia
cloud
came
to
be
more
and
more
a
part
of
the
lives
of
these
two
young
people
who
had
taken
her
for
their
it
was
on
these
outings
that
they
talked
over
serious
problems
whether
leslie
should
join
one
of
the
girls
sororities
what
they
should
do
about
the
next
christian
endeavor
meeting
why
it
was
that
howard
letchworth
and
jane
bristol
were
so
much
more
interesting
than
any
of
their
other
friends
why
cloudy
did
not
like
to
have
myrtle
villers
come
to
the
house
and
what
allison
was
going
to
do
in
life
when
he
got
through
with
college
they
were
absolutely
one
in
all
their
thoughts
and
wishes
just
at
this
time
and
there
was
not
anything
that
any
one
of
them
would
not
willingly
talk
over
with
the
others
it
was
a
beautiful
relation
and
one
that
julia
cloud
daily
tremblingly
prayed
might
last
might
find
nothing
to
break
it
up
by
this
time
the
young
people
had
begun
to
bring
their
college
mates
to
the
house
and
everybody
up
there
was
crazy
for
an
invitation
to
the
little
lunches
and
dinners
and
pleasant
evening
gatherings
that
had
begun
to
be
so
popular
there
were
not
wanting
the
usual
girls
who
went
eagerly
trailing
allison
literally
begging
him
for
rides
and
attention
and
making
up
to
julia
cloud
and
leslie
in
the
most
sickening
of
silly
girl
fashions
and
of
these
myrtle
villers
was
at
once
the
most
subtle
and
least
attractive
julia
cloud
had
an
intuitive
shrinking
from
her
at
the
start
although
she
tried
in
her
sweet
christian
way
to
overcome
it
and
do
as
much
for
this
girl
as
she
was
trying
to
do
for
all
the
others
who
came
into
their
home
but
myrtle
villers
was
quick
to
understand
and
played
her
part
so
well
that
it
was
impossible
to
shake
her
off
as
some
might
have
been
shaken
she
studied
leslie
like
an
artist
and
learned
how
to
play
upon
her
frank
emotional
impulsive
nature
she
confided
in
her
telling
the
sorrows
of
an
unloved
life
and
her
longings
for
great
and
better
things
and
fell
to
attending
christian
endeavor
most
strenuously
she
was
always
coming
home
with
leslie
for
overnight
and
being
around
in
the
way
allison
did
not
like
her
in
the
least
and
julia
cloud
barely
tolerated
her
but
as
the
weeks
went
by
leslie
began
to
champion
her
to
tell
the
others
they
were
unfair
to
the
girl
and
that
she
really
had
a
sincere
heart
and
a
lovely
nature
which
had
been
crushed
by
loneliness
and
sorrow
allison
always
snorted
angrily
when
leslie
got
off
anything
like
that
and
habitually
absented
himself
whenever
he
knew
the
vamp
as
he
called
her
was
to
be
there
it
was
one
day
quite
late
in
the
fall
almost
their
last
balmy
picnic
before
the
cold
weather
set
in
that
they
were
sitting
up
on
the
rocks
around
a
pleasant
resinous
fire
they
had
made
discussing
this
allison
was
maintaining
that
it
was
not
good
for
leslie
to
go
with
a
girl
like
that
that
all
the
fellows
despised
and
leslie
was
pouting
and
saying
she
did
see
why
he
had
to
be
so
prejudiced
and
unfair
and
julia
cloud
was
looking
troubled
and
wondering
whether
her
heart
and
her
head
were
both
on
the
wrong
side
or
what
she
ought
to
do
about
it
when
a
step
behind
them
made
them
all
turn
around
startled
it
was
the
first
time
they
had
been
interrupted
by
an
intruder
in
this
retreat
and
it
had
come
to
seem
all
their
own
moreover
the
cocoa
on
the
fire
was
boiling
and
the
lunch
was
about
to
be
served
on
the
little
paper
plates
there
stood
a
tall
man
with
a
keen
face
a
scholarly
air
and
an
unmistakably
wistful
look
in
his
eyes
why
is
this
where
you
spend
your
nooning
cloud
it
certainly
looks
inviting
he
said
with
a
comprehensive
glance
at
the
sandwiches
and
the
little
heap
of
cakes
and
fruit
allison
arose
with
belated
recognition
o
dr
bowman
he
said
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
aunt
miss
cloud
and
my
sister
leslie
the
scholarly
gentleman
bowed
low
in
acknowledgment
of
the
introduction
and
fairly
seemed
to
melt
under
the
situation
well
now
this
certainly
is
delightful
he
said
still
eying
the
generously
spread
rock
table
quite
an
idea
quite
an
idea
is
this
some
special
occasion
some
celebration
or
something
he
glanced
genially
round
on
the
group
oh
no
we
often
bring
our
lunch
out
here
said
julia
cloud
in
a
tone
it
keeps
us
and
makes
a
pleasant
change
there
was
finality
in
her
tone
and
a
professor
would
have
moved
on
at
once
for
the
cocoa
was
boiling
over
and
had
to
be
rescued
and
he
might
have
seen
they
did
not
want
him
but
he
lingered
affably
well
that
certainly
is
an
original
idea
quite
so
it
really
makes
one
quite
hungry
to
think
of
it
that
certainly
looks
like
an
attractive
repast
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
invite
him
to
partake
which
allison
did
as
curtly
as
he
dared
considering
that
the
intruder
was
one
of
his
major
professors
and
hoping
sincerely
that
he
would
refuse
but
professor
bowman
did
not
refuse
no
such
good
chance
and
quite
to
julia
cloud
annoyance
for
she
wanted
to
have
the
talk
out
with
her
children
he
sat
himself
down
on
the
rock
as
if
he
were
quite
acclimated
to
picnics
in
november
and
accepted
so
many
sandwiches
that
leslie
seated
slightly
behind
and
out
of
his
sight
made
mock
signs
of
horror
lest
there
should
not
be
enough
to
go
around
it
appeared
that
he
had
started
out
to
search
for
his
which
his
young
son
had
borrowed
and
lost
somewhere
in
that
region
as
nearly
as
he
could
remember
and
thus
had
come
upon
the
picnickers
old
pill
growled
allison
gruffly
when
at
last
the
unwelcome
guest
had
departed
hastily
to
a
class
with
many
praises
for
his
dinner
and
a
promise
to
call
to
see
them
in
the
near
future
old
pill
now
never
dare
to
come
here
again
as
long
as
he
around
bother
him
i
wish
i
told
him
to
go
to
thunder
we
do
want
him
he
lives
right
up
here
over
that
bluff
his
wife
dead
and
his
sister
or
aunt
or
something
keeps
house
for
him
she
looks
like
a
bottle
of
pickles
say
cloudy
we
just
be
out
evenings
for
a
while
till
he
forgets
it
but
dr
bowman
did
not
forget
it
as
allison
had
hoped
he
came
the
very
next
week
on
a
stormy
night
when
no
one
in
his
senses
would
go
out
if
he
could
help
it
and
there
were
the
gay
little
household
with
the
addition
of
jane
bristol
and
howard
letchworth
down
on
their
knees
before
the
fire
roasting
chestnuts
toasting
marshmallows
and
telling
stories
his
grim
angular
presence
descended
upon
the
joyous
gathering
like
a
wet
blanket
and
the
young
people
subsided
into
silence
until
leslie
rising
to
the
occasion
went
to
the
piano
and
started
them
all
singing
a
wicked
little
spirit
seemed
to
possess
her
and
she
picked
out
the
most
jazzy
she
could
find
hoping
to
freeze
out
the
unwelcome
guest
but
he
sat
with
patient
set
smile
and
endured
it
making
what
he
seemed
to
think
were
little
pleasantries
to
julia
cloud
who
sat
by
busy
with
some
embroidery
she
poor
lady
was
divided
between
a
wicked
delight
at
the
daring
of
the
children
and
a
horror
of
reproach
that
they
should
be
treating
a
college
professor
in
this
rude
manner
she
certainly
gave
him
no
encouragement
and
when
he
at
last
rose
to
go
saying
he
had
spent
a
very
pleasant
and
profitable
evening
getting
acquainted
with
his
students
and
he
thought
he
should
soon
repeat
it
she
did
not
ask
him
to
return
but
he
was
a
man
of
the
kind
who
needs
no
encouragement
and
he
did
return
many
times
and
often
until
he
became
a
fixed
institution
which
taxed
all
their
faculties
inventing
ways
of
escape
from
him
the
winter
went
and
dr
bowman
became
the
one
fly
in
the
pleasant
ointment
of
cloud
villa
we
just
have
to
send
cloudy
away
awhile
or
put
her
to
bed
and
pretend
she
is
sick
every
time
he
comes
or
something
said
leslie
one
night
after
his
departure
had
made
them
free
to
express
their
feelings
we
tried
everything
else
he
just
wo
take
a
hint
what
do
you
say
cloudy
will
you
play
sick
my
dear
said
julia
cloud
aghast
he
does
come
to
see
me
what
on
earth
put
that
in
your
head
her
face
was
flaming
scarlet
and
distress
showed
in
every
feature
the
children
fairly
shouted
you
dear
old
blind
cloudy
of
course
he
does
who
on
earth
else
would
he
come
to
see
but
said
julia
cloud
tears
coming
into
her
eyes
he
must
i
do
want
to
see
him
mercy
that
all
right
cloudy
you
should
worry
i
go
tell
him
so
if
you
want
me
to
allison
you
would
said
julia
cloud
aghast
no
of
course
not
cloudy
but
we
find
a
way
to
get
rid
of
the
old
pill
if
we
have
to
move
away
for
a
while
nevertheless
the
old
pill
continued
to
come
early
and
often
and
there
seemed
no
escape
for
he
was
continually
stealing
in
on
their
privacy
at
the
most
unexpected
times
and
acting
as
if
he
were
sure
of
a
welcome
the
children
froze
him
and
were
rude
and
julia
cloud
withdrew
farther
and
farther
but
nothing
seemed
to
faze
him
it
too
bad
to
have
so
much
sweetness
wasted
mocked
leslie
one
night
at
the
when
their
unwelcome
visitor
had
been
a
subject
of
discussion
miss
detliff
is
eating
her
heart
out
for
him
she
always
noseying
round
in
the
hall
when
his
class
is
out
and
it
about
time
for
hers
to
begin
just
to
get
a
word
with
him
she
kept
us
waiting
for
our
papers
ten
whole
minutes
the
other
day
while
she
discussed
better
classroom
ventilation
with
him
doctah
you
think
we
might
do
something
about
this
mattah
of
ventilation
she
mimicked
convulsing
allison
with
her
likeness
to
her
english
teacher
that
an
idea
said
allison
suddenly
no
do
ask
me
what
it
is
it
would
spoil
things
cloudy
may
i
bring
a
guest
to
dinner
night
certainly
anybody
you
please
replied
julia
cloud
innocently
and
the
incorrigible
allison
appeared
the
next
afternoon
with
miss
detliff
smiling
and
pleased
sitting
up
in
the
back
seat
of
the
car
julia
cloud
received
her
graciously
and
never
so
much
as
suspected
anything
special
was
going
on
until
later
in
the
evening
when
dr
bowman
arrived
and
was
ushered
in
to
find
his
colaborer
there
before
him
he
did
not
look
especially
pleased
and
julia
cloud
caught
a
glance
of
intelligence
passing
between
leslie
and
allison
with
a
sudden
revelation
of
a
plot
behind
it
all
during
the
entire
evening
she
sat
quietly
saying
little
but
her
eyes
dancing
with
the
fun
of
it
what
children
they
were
and
how
she
loved
them
yes
and
what
a
child
she
was
herself
for
she
could
help
loving
their
pranks
as
well
as
they
did
however
though
dr
bowman
had
to
take
miss
detliff
home
and
got
very
little
satisfaction
out
of
his
call
that
evening
it
did
not
discourage
him
in
the
least
and
julia
cloud
decided
that
extreme
measures
were
necessary
to
rid
them
of
his
presence
we
might
go
away
during
thanksgiving
week
only
there
the
christian
endeavor
banquet
said
leslie
we
could
be
away
from
that
and
then
i
wanted
to
have
jane
to
dinner
she
gone
up
to
college
this
week
to
live
she
doing
office
work
there
and
she
be
alone
on
thanksgiving
day
yes
and
there
howard
i
thought
we
have
him
here
put
in
allison
dubiously
of
course
said
julia
cloud
determinedly
and
we
do
want
to
go
away
anyway
you
children
run
up
to
your
rooms
this
evening
and
study
stay
there
i
mean
no
matter
who
comes
do
you
understand
with
a
curious
look
at
her
they
both
obeyed
and
a
little
later
when
the
knocker
sounded
through
the
house
they
sat
silently
above
not
daring
to
move
and
heard
their
aunt
open
the
door
heard
dr
slow
scholarly
voice
and
julia
cloud
even
tones
back
and
forth
for
a
little
while
and
then
heard
the
front
door
open
and
shut
again
and
slow
steps
go
down
the
brick
terrace
and
out
to
the
sidewalk
what
passed
in
that
interview
no
one
ever
knew
julia
cloud
came
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
called
them
down
and
her
eyes
were
shining
and
confident
as
she
sat
by
the
lamp
and
sewed
while
they
studied
and
joked
in
front
of
the
fire
but
the
unwelcome
guest
came
no
more
and
whenever
they
met
him
in
the
street
or
at
receptions
or
passing
at
a
college
game
he
gave
them
a
distant
pleasant
bow
that
was
all
julia
cloud
had
done
the
work
well
however
she
had
done
it
the
little
bowmans
need
not
look
to
her
to
fill
their
mother
place
for
she
was
not
so
minded
meantime
the
winter
had
been
going
on
and
the
little
house
was
becoming
popular
among
the
students
at
college
as
well
as
among
the
members
of
the
christian
endeavor
society
of
the
little
brick
church
many
an
evening
specially
picked
groups
of
girls
or
boys
or
both
spent
before
that
fire
playing
games
and
talking
and
singing
sometimes
the
college
came
down
and
had
dinner
again
it
was
the
football
team
that
was
feasted
another
time
allison
frat
came
for
his
birthday
aided
and
abetted
by
his
sister
and
aunt
jane
bristol
became
a
frequent
visitor
though
not
so
frequent
as
they
would
have
liked
to
have
her
for
her
time
was
very
much
taken
up
with
her
work
and
her
studies
julia
cloud
often
wished
she
might
lift
the
financial
burden
from
the
young
shoulders
and
make
things
easier
for
her
both
for
her
own
sake
and
leslie
who
would
have
liked
to
make
her
her
constant
companion
but
jane
bristol
was
too
independent
to
let
anybody
help
her
and
there
seemed
no
way
to
do
anything
about
it
meantime
myrtle
villers
improved
each
idle
hour
and
kept
leslie
busy
inventing
excuses
to
get
away
from
her
and
julia
cloud
busy
worrying
leslie
was
so
dear
but
she
was
also
and
she
would
go
off
with
that
wild
girl
in
the
car
for
long
rides
not
that
julia
cloud
worried
about
the
driving
for
leslie
was
most
careful
and
handled
a
car
as
if
she
had
been
born
with
the
knowledge
as
indeed
she
did
all
things
athletic
but
her
aunt
distrusted
the
other
girl
and
then
one
clear
cold
afternoon
in
december
leslie
went
off
for
a
ride
in
the
car
with
myrtle
of
course
julia
cloud
did
not
know
that
the
girl
had
pestered
the
life
out
of
leslie
for
the
ride
and
had
finally
promised
that
if
she
would
go
she
would
stop
going
with
a
certain
wild
boy
in
the
village
of
whom
leslie
disapproved
neither
did
she
know
that
leslie
had
resolved
never
to
go
again
without
her
aunt
along
so
she
sat
at
the
window
through
the
short
winter
afternoon
and
watched
and
waited
in
vain
for
the
car
to
return
and
allison
came
back
at
six
after
practice
and
still
leslie
had
not
appeared
chapter
xxi
there
had
been
a
little
friction
between
allison
and
leslie
about
the
use
of
the
car
allison
had
always
been
most
generous
with
it
until
his
sister
took
up
this
absurd
intimacy
with
myrtle
villers
it
has
been
rather
understood
between
them
that
leslie
should
use
the
car
afternoons
when
she
wanted
it
as
allison
was
busy
with
and
other
things
but
several
times
allison
had
objected
to
his
sister
taking
her
new
friend
out
and
leslie
told
him
he
was
unfair
after
a
heated
discussion
they
had
left
the
question
still
unsettled
in
fact
it
did
not
seem
that
it
could
be
settled
for
leslie
was
of
such
a
nature
that
great
opposition
only
made
her
more
firm
and
julia
cloud
advised
her
nephew
to
say
nothing
more
for
a
time
let
leslie
find
out
for
herself
the
character
of
the
girl
she
had
made
her
friend
it
was
really
the
only
way
she
would
learn
not
to
be
carried
away
by
flattery
and
words
allison
grumbling
a
little
assented
but
in
his
heart
he
still
boiled
with
rage
at
the
idea
of
that
girl
winding
his
sister
around
her
little
finger
just
for
the
sake
of
using
the
car
when
she
wanted
it
it
was
not
perhaps
all
happening
that
for
two
or
three
days
allison
had
left
the
where
his
sister
could
not
find
it
and
a
hot
war
of
words
ended
in
leslie
quietly
ordering
a
new
so
that
such
a
happening
would
be
impossible
in
future
she
would
have
one
of
her
own
a
card
had
come
that
very
morning
from
the
express
office
notifying
leslie
that
there
was
a
package
there
waiting
for
her
so
when
she
started
out
with
myrtle
she
stopped
and
got
it
she
tossed
it
carelessly
into
the
car
with
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
that
now
allison
could
not
hamper
her
movements
any
longer
by
his
carelessness
which
way
shall
we
go
she
asked
as
she
always
did
when
taking
her
friends
out
and
myrtle
named
a
favorite
pike
where
they
often
drove
out
upon
the
smooth
white
road
they
sped
rejoicing
in
the
clear
beauty
of
the
day
and
in
the
freedom
with
which
they
flew
through
space
myrtle
had
chosen
to
sit
in
the
back
seat
and
lolled
happily
among
rugs
and
wraps
keeping
a
keen
eye
out
on
the
road
ahead
and
chattering
away
like
a
magpie
to
leslie
telling
her
what
a
darling
she
was
she
pronounced
it
dolling
and
how
this
ride
was
just
the
one
thing
she
needed
to
recuperate
from
her
violent
study
of
the
night
before
incident
to
an
examination
that
morning
myrtle
professed
to
be
utterly
overcome
and
exhausted
by
the
physical
effort
of
writing
for
three
whole
hours
without
a
if
leslie
could
have
seen
her
meagre
paper
through
which
a
professor
was
at
that
moment
wearily
plodding
she
would
have
been
astonished
leslie
herself
was
keen
and
thorough
in
her
class
work
and
had
no
slightest
conception
of
what
a
lazy
student
could
avoid
when
she
set
herself
to
do
so
five
miles
from
home
two
masculine
figures
came
in
sight
ahead
strolling
leisurely
down
the
road
any
one
watching
might
have
seen
myrtle
suddenly
straighten
up
and
cast
a
hasty
glance
at
leslie
but
leslie
with
bright
cheeks
and
shining
eyes
was
forging
ahead
regardless
of
stray
strollers
at
exactly
the
right
moment
myrtle
leaned
forward
and
clutched
leslie
shoulder
excitedly
o
leslie
that
my
cousin
fred
hicks
and
that
must
be
his
friend
bartram
laws
they
out
for
a
hike
how
lucky
stop
a
minute
please
i
want
to
speak
to
my
cousin
at
the
same
moment
the
two
young
men
turned
with
a
lifting
of
surprised
hats
in
response
to
myrtle
violent
waving
and
shouting
leslie
of
course
slowed
down
she
could
not
carry
a
girl
past
her
own
cousin
when
she
asked
to
stop
to
speak
to
him
besides
it
never
occurred
to
her
not
to
do
so
myrtle
went
through
the
introductions
glibly
laws
meet
my
friend
miss
cloud
my
cousin
fred
hicks
leslie
pile
in
boys
is
this
great
that
we
should
meet
out
for
a
hike
we
give
you
a
lift
which
way
are
you
going
fred
you
can
sit
in
front
with
leslie
i
want
bart
back
here
with
me
leslie
caught
her
breath
in
a
troubled
hesitancy
this
was
the
kind
of
thing
she
had
bargained
for
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
her
aunt
and
brother
would
object
to
most
strenuously
yet
how
could
she
object
when
her
guest
had
asked
them
of
course
myrtle
did
realize
that
it
was
not
quite
the
thing
for
them
to
be
off
here
in
the
country
unchaperoned
with
two
strange
young
men
though
of
course
they
were
strangers
really
both
of
them
friends
of
myrtle
and
one
her
cousin
myrtle
could
not
be
expected
to
think
how
it
would
seem
to
her
but
the
young
men
were
not
waiting
for
leslie
invitation
they
seemed
to
feel
that
their
company
would
be
ample
compensation
for
any
objections
that
might
be
had
they
scrambled
in
with
alacrity
the
color
flew
into
leslie
cheeks
in
her
heart
she
said
they
were
altogether
too
fresh
why
i
suppose
we
can
give
you
a
lift
for
a
little
way
said
leslie
trying
to
sound
patronizing
how
far
are
you
going
we
turn
off
here
pretty
soon
oh
that
all
right
said
cousin
fred
easily
any
old
road
suits
us
so
it
going
in
this
direction
want
me
to
take
the
wheel
no
thank
you
said
leslie
coldly
i
always
drive
myself
my
brother
does
care
for
me
to
let
other
people
use
the
car
that
all
right
i
thought
you
might
be
tired
and
i
a
great
driver
people
trust
me
that
wo
trust
any
one
else
that
right
leslie
chimed
in
myrtle
fred
can
drive
like
a
breeze
you
ought
to
see
him
leslie
said
nothing
but
dropped
in
the
clutch
and
drove
on
she
was
not
prepossessed
in
fred
hicks
favor
she
let
him
make
all
the
remarks
and
sat
like
a
slim
straight
little
offended
goddess
but
fred
hicks
was
not
disturbed
in
the
least
he
started
in
telling
a
story
about
a
trip
he
took
from
washington
up
to
harrisburg
in
an
incredibly
brief
space
of
time
and
he
laughed
uproariously
at
all
his
own
jokes
leslie
was
a
girl
of
violent
likes
and
dislikes
and
she
took
one
of
them
now
she
fairly
froze
cousin
fred
though
he
showed
no
outward
sign
of
being
aware
of
it
here
a
nice
road
off
to
the
right
he
indicated
reaching
out
a
commanding
hand
to
the
wheel
suddenly
turn
here
leslie
with
set
lips
bore
on
past
the
suggested
road
at
high
speed
please
do
touch
my
wheel
was
all
she
said
in
a
haughty
little
voice
she
was
very
angry
indeed
they
were
nearing
an
old
mansion
closed
now
for
the
winter
with
a
small
artificial
lake
between
the
grounds
and
the
highway
leslie
felt
a
passing
wish
that
she
might
dump
her
undesired
cargo
in
that
lake
and
fly
away
from
them
i
think
you
will
have
to
get
out
at
the
next
crossroads
she
said
with
more
dignity
i
have
to
go
home
now
why
leslie
cloud
you
do
any
such
thing
broke
in
myrtle
you
told
me
you
could
be
out
till
quarter
of
six
it
only
four
i
thought
you
were
a
good
sport
i
changed
my
mind
said
leslie
coldly
bringing
the
car
to
a
standstill
i
going
back
right
now
do
you
and
your
friend
want
to
get
out
here
mr
hicks
fred
hicks
lolled
back
in
the
car
and
leered
at
leslie
why
no
i
ca
say
i
particularly
anxious
to
get
out
but
i
think
i
like
to
change
around
a
little
if
you
just
step
over
here
i
run
the
car
for
you
my
dear
i
do
think
myrtle
is
ready
to
go
back
yet
how
it
myrt
he
turned
and
deliberately
winked
at
myrtle
who
leaned
over
with
a
light
laugh
and
patted
leslie
on
the
shoulder
there
there
leslie
do
get
up
in
the
air
she
soothed
explain
all
about
it
if
you
just
turn
around
and
go
up
that
road
back
there
it
wo
take
you
much
longer
and
we
be
back
in
plenty
of
time
the
fact
is
i
had
a
little
plan
in
the
back
of
my
head
when
i
came
out
this
afternoon
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
out
now
be
a
good
girl
and
let
fred
run
the
car
a
little
while
he
wo
do
it
any
harm
and
your
brother
will
never
know
a
thing
about
it
leslie
eyes
were
flashing
and
her
head
was
held
haughtily
but
she
kept
her
hands
firmly
on
the
wheel
your
friends
will
have
to
get
out
myrtle
she
said
coldly
i
help
you
out
in
any
scheme
i
do
understand
you
have
to
go
to
some
one
else
for
that
kind
of
help
myrtle
pouted
i
must
say
i
do
think

nice
leslie

that
way

this
time

i

guardians

until

college

understand
why

much

price
but
he
was
just
a
for
bart
and
me
now
do
you
understand
why
i
wanted
you
to
go
this
afternoon
myrtle
voice
was
very
soft
and
insinuating
she
had
tears
always
near
the
surface
for
ready
use
you
never
have
been
in
love
leslie
you
do
know
what
it

anything
in
the
world
for
you
if
you
only
help
me
out
now
and
if
i
wo
asked
leslie
calmly
deliberately
as
if
she
were
really
weighing

leslie
mouth
shut
in
a
pretty
little
tight
line
and
her
eyes
got
like
two
blue
sparks
but
her
voice
was
cool
and
steady
well
i
she
said
tensely
and
with
a
sudden
motion
she
grabbed
the
and
springing
to
her
feet
flung
it
far
out
across
the
road
across
a
little
scuttled
canoe
that
lay
at
the
bank
and
plunk
into
the
water
before
the
other
occupants
of
the
car
could
realize
what
she
was
doing
fred
hicks
saw
just
an
instant
too
late
and
sprang
for
her
arm
to
stop
it
then
arose
in
his
seat
with
curses
on
his
lips
watching
the
exact
location
of
the
splash
and
calling
to
his
mate
to
go
out
and
fish
for
it
leslie
sank
back
in
her
seat
tense
and
white
and
both
young
men
sprang
out
and
rushed
to
the
shore
of
the
little
lake
leaving
a
stream
of
unspeakable
language
behind
them
myrtle
began
to
berate
her
friend

little
she
said

were
smart
but
you
nothing
but
an
ignorant
little
kid
but
the
ignorant
little
kid
was
not
listening
with
trembling
fingers
she
was
pulling
off
the
wrappings
from
a
small
package
and
suddenly
a
warning
whir
cut
short
myrtle
harangue
she
lurched
forward
and
tried
to
pull
leslie
hands
away
from
the
wheel
bart
come
quick
she
got
another
hurry
boys
chapter
xxii
the
two
young
men
had
shoved
the
old
canoe
up
on
the
bank
turned
it
over
emptied
it
and
put
it
back
in
the
water
fred
hicks
was
holding
it
at
arm
length
now
in
the
water
and
the
bridegroom
had
crawled
out
to
the
extreme
end
and
with
sleeves
was
pawing
about
in
the
water
which
did
not
appear
to
be
very
deep
at
the
cry
they
turned
and
fred
hicks
forgetting
the
other
man
plight
let
go
the
boat
and
dashed
back
to
the
road
young
laws
arising
too
hastily
rolled
into
the
water
completely
and
came
splashing
up
the
bank
in
a
frothy
state
of
mind
but
suddenly
as
they
came
while
myrtle
best
efforts
were
put
forth
to
hinder
leslie
movements
something
cold
and
gleaming
flashed
in
her
face
that
sent
her
crouching
back
in
the
corner
of
her
seat
and
screaming
leslie
had
slipped
her
hand
into
the
little
secret
pocket
of
the
car
door
and
brought
out
her
revolver
hoping
fervently
that
it
was
still
loaded
and
that
allison
had
not
chosen
to
shoot
at
a
mark
or
anything
with
it
the
last
time
he
was
out
you
better
sit
down
and
keep
quiet
she
said
coolly
i
a
good
shot
then
she
put
her
foot
on
the
clutch
and
the
car
started
just
as
fred
hicks
lit
on
the
leslie
little
revolver
came
promptly
around
to
meet
him
and
he
dropped
away
with
a
gasp
of
surprise
as
suddenly
as
he
had
lit
suddenly
leslie
became
aware
of
the
other
young
man
dripping
and
breathless
but
with
a
dangerous
look
in
his
eye
bearing
down
upon
her
from
the
lake
side
of
the
road
and
she
flashed
around
and
sent
a
shot
ringing
out
into
the
road
the
bullet
ploughing
into
the
dust
at
his
very
feet
the
car
leaped
forward
to
obey
her
touch
and
in
a
second
more
they
had
left
the
two
young
men
safely
behind
them
myrtle
was
crouched
in
the
back
seat
weeping
and
leslie
cool
and
brave
in
the
front
seat
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
this
was
a
new
road
to
her
at
least
she
had
never
been
more
than
two
or
three
miles
on
it
and
she
did
not
know
where
she
would
bring
up
she
began
to
wonder
how
long
her
gasoline
would
hold
out
for
she
had
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
away
with
myrtle
before
allison
should
come
home
that
she
had
forgotten
to
look
to
see
if
everything
was
all
right
and
she
now
remembered
that
allison
had
had
the
car
out
late
the
night
before
everything
seemed
to
be
falling
in
chaos
about
her
the
earth
rose
and
fell
in
front
of
her
excited
gaze
the
sun
was
going
down
and
the
road
ahead
seemed
endless
without
a
turning
as
far
as
she
could
see
a
great
stretched
for
what
seemed
like
miles
along
one
side
of
the
road
the
polished
marble
gleamed
red
and
bleak
in
the
setting
sun
the
sky
had
suddenly
gone
and
there
was
a
chill
in
the
air
leslie
longed
for
nothing
so
much
as
to
hide
her
head
in
julia
cloud
lap
and
weep
yet
she
must
go
on
and
on
and
on
till
this
awful
road
came
to
an
end
would
it
come
to
an
end
oh
it
somewhere
a
great
tower
of
bricks
loomed
ahead
with
a
wide
paved
driveway
leading
to
it
through
an
arched
gateway
and
over
the
arch
some
words
leslie
got
only
one
of
them
crematory
she
shuddered
and
put
on
speed
it
seemed
that
she
had
come
to
the
place
of
death
and
desolation
it
was
lonely
everywhere
and
not
a
soul
in
sight
what
horror
if
her
gasoline
should
give
out
in
a
place
like
this
and
they
have
to
spend
the
night
here
she
and
that
poor
weak
creature
sobbing
behind
what
contempt
she
felt
for
her
former
friend
what
contempt
she
felt
for
herself
oh
she
was
well
punished
for
her
wilfulness
to
think
she
should
have
presumed
to
hope
she
could
help
her
to
better
ways
she
a
little
innocent
who
never
dreamed
of
such
depths
of
duplicity
as
had
been
shown
her
that
afternoon
oh
to
think
of
that
loathsome
hicks
person
daring
to
touch
her
to
try
to
take
her
car
away
from
her
and
to
at
her
in
that
disgusting
way
on
and
on
went
the
car
and
the
road
wound
away
into
the
dusk
up
a
high
hill
and
down
again
up
another
past
an
old
farmhouse
with
one
dim
light
in
the
back
window
and
a
great
dog
howling
like
one
in
some
old
classic
tale
she
had
read
on
and
on
till
at
last
a
came
and
she
knew
not
which
way
to
take
to
right
or
to
left
there
was
a
but
it
was
too
dark
to
read
and
she
dared
not
get
out
and
leave
myrtle
there
was
no
telling
but
she
might
try
to
run
off
with
the
car
it
was
at
the
crematory
that
she
began
to
pray
and
when
she
reached
the
crossing
her
heart
put
up
a
second
plea
for
guidance
o
god
if
you
will
just
help
me
home
i
will
try
try
to
be
what
you
want
me
to
be
please
please
it
was
the
old
vow
of
a
heart
bowed
down
and
brought
to
the
limit
it
was
the
first
time
leslie
had
ever
realized
that
there
could
be
a
situation
in
which
leslie
cloud
would
not
find
some
way
out
it
was
the
first
time
too
perhaps
when
she
realized
herself
as
being
a
sinner
in
the
sense
of
having
a
will
against
god
and
having
exercised
it
for
her
own
pleasure
rather
than
for
his
glory
down
the
road
to
the
left
the
car
sped
and
after
a
mile
and
a
half
of
growing
darkness
with
woods
and
scattered
farmhouses
the
lights
of
a
village
began
to
appear
but
it
was
no
village
that
leslie
knew
and
nothing
anywhere
gave
her
a
clew
a
trolley
line
appeared
however
and
after
a
little
a
car
came
along
with
a
name
that
showed
it
was
going
cityward
leslie
decided
to
follow
the
trolley
track
in
the
meantime
the
girl
in
the
back
seat
roused
up
and
began
to
look
about
her
evidently
recognizing
something
familiar
in
the
streets
or
town
you
can
put
me
out
here
leslie
i
done
with
you
she
said
haughtily
i
do
care
to
go
any
farther
with
you
i
go
back
on
the
train
no
said
leslie
sharply
you
go
home
with
me
i
took
you
away
without
knowing
what
you
intended
but
i
mean
to
put
you
back
where
you
were
before
i
done
then
my
responsibility
for
you
will
be
over
i
was
a
fool
to
let
you
deceive
me
that
way
but
i
not
a
fool
any
longer
well
i
go
home
with
you
so
and
that
flat
leslie
cloud
you
need
think
you
can
frighten
me
into
going
either
we
in
a
village
now
and
my
aunt
lives
here
if
you
get
out
that
revolver
again
i
scream
and
have
you
arrested
and
tell
them
you
trying
to
murder
me
so
there
for
answer
leslie
turned
sharply
into
a
that
led
away
from
the
settled
portion
of
the
town
and
put
on
all
speed
tearing
away
into
the
dusk
like
a
wild
creature
myrtle
screamed
and
stormed
behind
her
all
to
no
purpose
leslie
cloud
had
her
mettle
up
and
meant
to
take
her
prisoner
home
out
of
the
town
she
turned
into
another
road
that
ran
parallel
to
the
trolley
track
from
which
she
could
see
the
lights
of
the
trolleys
passing
now
and
again
as
it
grew
darker
and
by
and
by
when
they
came
to
another
leslie
got
back
to
the
trolley
track
and
followed
it
but
whenever
they
came
into
a
town
she
kept
to
its
outskirts
leslie
had
a
pretty
good
general
sense
of
direction
and
she
knew
just
where
the
sun
went
down
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
river
and
some
hills
that
turned
up
and
bewildered
her
she
would
have
made
a
pretty
direct
course
home
but
as
it
was
she
went
far
out
of
her
way
and
was
long
delayed
and
much
distressed
besides
being
continually
harassed
by
the
angry
girl
in
the
back
seat
the
gasoline
was
holding
out
it
was
evident
that
allison
had
looked
after
it
blessed
allison
who
always
did
everything
when
he
ought
to
do
it
and
never
put
off
things
until
the
next
day
how
cross
she
had
been
with
him
for
the
last
six
weeks
and
how
good
and
kind
he
always
was
to
her
how
she
had
deceived
dear
cloudy
and
troubled
her
by
going
off
this
afternoon
oh
what
would
they
think
would
they
ever
forgive
her
and
take
her
back
into
their
hearts
and
trust
her
again
the
tears
were
blurring
her
eyes
now
as
she
stared
ahead
at
the
road
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
been
tearing
on
through
the
night
for
hours
like
this
her
arms
ached
with
the
nervous
strain
her
back
ached
her
head
ached
perhaps
they
were
going
around
the
world
and
would
only
stop
when
the
gasoline
gave
out
they
swept
around
a
curve
could
it
be
that
those
were
the
lights
of
the
college
ahead
on
the
hill
oh
joy
at
last
they
were
up
this
hill
over
across
two
blocks
and
the
little
house
would
be
nestled
among
the
hemlocks
and
rest
and
home
at
last
but
there
was
something
to
be
done
first
she
turned
toward
the
back
seat
where
sat
her
victim
silent
and
angry
well
you
can
let
me
out
now
leslie
cloud
said
myrtle
scornfully
i
suppose
you
wo
dare
lord
it
over
me
any
longer
and
i
take
good
care
that
the
rest
of
the
town
understands
what
a
dangerous
little
spitfire
are
you
ought
to
be
arrested
for
this
work
that
all
got
to
say
well
i
have
one
more
thing
to
say
said
leslie
slowly
as
she
swerved
into
her
own
street
and
her
eyes
hungrily
sought
for
the
lights
of
cloudy
villa
you
coming
into
the
house
with
me
first
before
you
go
anywhere
else
and
you
going
to
tell
this
whole
story
to
my
aunt
jewel
after
that
should
well
i
rather
guess
i
am
not
going
into
your
old
house
and
tell
your
old
aunt
anything
i
going
to
get
right
out
here
this
minute
and
you
good
and
going
to
me
out
too
or
i
scream
bloody
murder
and
tell
it
all
over
this
town
how
you
went
out
there
to
meet
those
boys
you
have
got
any
witnesses
and
remember
said
myrtle
suddenly
feeling
courageous
now
that
she
was
back
among
familiar
streets
but
leslie
turned
sharply
into
the
little
drive
and
brought
up
the
car
in
a
flood
of
light
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
now
get
out
she
ordered
swinging
the
door
open
and
flashing
her
little
revolver
about
again
at
the
angry
girl
o
leslie
pleaded
the
victim
quickly
quelled
by
the
sight
of
the
cold
steel
and
thrilled
with
the
memory
of
that
shot
whistling
by
her
into
the
road
a
few
hours
before
get
out
said
leslie
coolly
as
the
front
door
was
flung
open
and
julia
cloud
peered
through
the
brightness
of
the
porch
light
into
the
darkness
get
out
leslie
held
the
cold
steel
nearer
to
myrtle
face
and
the
girl
shuddered
and
got
out
now
go
into
the
house
she
ordered
and
shuddering
shivering
with
a
frightened
glance
behind
her
and
a
fearful
glance
ahead
she
walked
straight
into
the
wondering
shocked
presence
of
julia
cloud
who
threw
the
door
open
wide
and
stepped
aside
to
let
them
in
leslie
with
the
revolver
still
raised
and
pointed
toward
the
other
girl
came
close
behind
myrtle
who
sidled
hastily
around
to
get
behind
miss
cloud
why
leslie
what
is
the
matter
gasped
julia
cloud
tell
her
ordered
leslie
the
revolver
still
pointed
straight
at
myrtle
what
shall
i
tell
gasped
the
other
girl
turning
a
white
miserable
face
toward
miss
cloud
as
if
to
appeal
to
her
leniency
but
there
was
a
severity
in
julia
cloud
face
now
after
her
long
hours
of
anxiety
that
boded
no
good
for
the
cause
of
all
her
alarm
tell
her
the
whole
story
ordered
the
fierce
young
voice
of
leslie
why
we
went
out
to
take
a
ride
began
myrtle
looking
up
with
her
old
braggadocio
there
had
seldom
been
a
time
when
myrtle
had
not
been
able
to
get
out
of
a
situation
by
use
of
her
wily
tongue
tell
it
all
said
leslie
looking
across
the
barrel
of
her
weapon
tell
who
wanted
to
go
on
that
ride
why
yes
i
asked
leslie
to
take
me
i
we
well
that
is
i
wanted
to
meet
a
friend
tell
it
straight
ordered
leslie
why
of
course
i
did
tell
leslie
i
expected
to
meet
them
him
i
was
just
sure
he
could
make
the
arrangements
i
meant
to
tell
her
when
we
got
out
and
when
we
met
him
and
my
cousin
it
was
my
cousin
i
was
to
meet
you
see
i
we
he
myrtle
was
getting
all
tangled
up
with
her
glib
tongue
under
the
clear
gaze
of
julia
cloud
eyes
she
looked
up
and
down
and
twisted
the
fringe
on
her
sash
and
turned
red
and
white
by
turns
and
seemed
for
the
first
time
a
very
young
very
silly
child
but
leslie
had
suffered
and
just
now
leslie
had
no
mercy
this
girl
had
been
a
kind
of
idol
to
whom
she
had
sacrificed
much
and
now
that
her
idol
had
fallen
she
wanted
to
make
the
idol
pay
or
no
was
that
it
leslie
afterwards
searched
her
heart
and
felt
that
she
could
truly
say
that
her
strongest
motive
in
compelling
this
confession
had
been
to
get
the
burden
of
the
knowledge
of
it
off
her
own
shrinking
soul
tell
the
rest
came
the
relentless
voice
of
leslie
and
myrtle
struggled
on
well
i
engaged
to
bartram
laws
and
my
guardian
wo
let
us
get
married
till
i
through
college
and
we
fixed
it
up
to
get
married
quietly
i
knew
it
would
be
all
right
after
he
found
out
he
could
help
himself
and
so
tell
how
you
asked
the
boys
to
get
in
the
car
ordered
the
fierce
voice
again
and
myrtle
recalled
from
another
attempt
to
pass
it
all
off
pleasantly
went
step
by
step
through
the
whole
shameful
story
until
it
was
complete
then
leslie
with
a
sudden
motion
of
finality
flung
the
little
weapon
down
upon
the
mahogany
table
and
dashed
into
julia
cloud
arms
in
a
storm
of
tears
o
cloudy
i
never
never
do
any
such
thing
again
and
i
hate
her
i
her
i
never
forgive
her
can
you
ever
forgive
no
one
had
heard
a
sudden
startled
exclamation
from
the
porch
room
as
leslie
and
myrtle
came
into
the
house
but
now
myrtle
suddenly
looked
up
thinking
the
time
had
come
for
her
to
steal
away
unseen
and
there
in
the
two
doorways
that
opened
on
either
side
of
the
fireplace
stood
on
one
side
allison
cloud
and
the
dean
of
the
college
and
on
the
other
side
two
members
of
the
student
executive
body
all
looking
straight
at
her
moreover
she
read
it
in
their
eyes
that
they
had
heard
every
word
of
her
confession
without
a
word
she
dropped
white
and
stricken
into
a
chair
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
for
once
her
brazen
wiles
were
gone
chapter
xxiii
it
happened
that
miss
myrtle
villers
had
not
confined
her
affections
to
bartram
laws
she
had
been
seen
wandering
about
the
campus
with
other
youths
at
odd
hours
of
the
evening
when
students
were
supposed
to
be
safely
within
college
halls
or
properly
chaperoned
at
some
public
gathering
the
student
exec
had
had
her
in
tow
for
several
weeks
and
she
had
already
received
a
number
of
reproofs
and
warnings
a
daring
escapade
the
evening
before
had
brought
matters
to
a
head
and
it
was
very
possibly
because
of
some
suspicion
that
they
might
have
found
her
out
that
myrtle
had
made
her
plans
to
be
absent
on
that
afternoon
however
that
was
when
the
executive
body
in
consultation
with
the
dean
sent
for
her
they
traced
her
to
the
clouds
house
at
least
they
came
there
about
seven
to
inquire
and
hoping
to
take
her
unaware
they
had
found
allison
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
telephoning
hither
and
yon
to
try
to
get
some
clew
to
his
sister
whereabouts
they
had
remained
to
advise
and
suggest
greatly
worried
at
the
whole
situation
the
more
so
because
it
involved
leslie
cloud
whose
bright
presence
had
taken
great
hold
upon
everybody
and
now
without
knowing
it
leslie
cloud
had
taken
the
one
way
to
put
the
whole
matter
into
the
right
hands
and
to
exonerate
herself
if
she
had
known
that
any
member
of
the
faculty
was
in
that
room
listening
if
she
had
dreamed
that
even
her
brother
was
there
she
would
not
have
thought
it
right
or
honorable
to
put
even
an
enemy
in
such
a
position
either
for
her
own
sake
or
for
the
girl
she
had
only
wanted
some
wise
true
adviser
to
know
the
truth
so
that
the
girl
might
learn
what
was
right
and
have
the
responsibility
taken
from
her
own
shoulders
she
thought
too
that
she
had
a
right
to
be
exonerated
before
her
aunt
so
now
while
she
wept
out
her
contrition
in
julia
cloud
arms
retribution
was
coming
swiftly
to
myrtle
villers
and
her
career
in
that
college
was
sealed
with
finality
it
was
only
too
plain
that
such
a
girl
was
a
menace
to
the
other
students
and
needed
to
be
removed
presently
leslie
feeling
something
strange
in
the
atmosphere
lifted
frightened
eyes
and
saw
the
grave
faces
of
the
dean
and
his
companions
she
held
her
breath
with
suspense
how
terrible
how
public
and
unseemly
she
had
brought
all
this
upon
herself
and
her
family
by
her
persistent
friendship
with
this
silly
girl
and
she
fell
to
trembling
and
shuddering
all
her
fine
sweet
nerve
gone
now
that
the
strain
was
over
julia
cloud
drew
her
down
upon
the
couch
and
soothed
her
covering
her
with
an
afghan
and
trying
to
comfort
her
then
the
dean
stepped
over
to
the
couch
and
spoke
to
leslie
miss
cloud
you
must
not
feel
so
bad
he
said
gently
as
if
she
had
been
his
own
child
you
have
acted
nobly
and
no
one
will
blame
you
you
have
perhaps
saved
miss
villers
from
great
shame
and
sorrow
and
you
certainly
have
been
brave
and
true
do
worry
child
and
he
patted
leslie
heaving
shoulder
kindly
presently
the
dean
and
his
committee
were
gone
taking
the
cowering
myrtle
with
them
and
leslie
lay
snuggled
up
on
the
couch
with
allison
building
up
the
fire
and
cherry
bringing
a
tray
with
a
nice
supper
julia
cloud
fixed
a
bag
to
warm
the
chilled
hands
and
feet
it
was
so
good
to
be
at
home
the
tears
rushed
into
her
eyes
again
and
her
throat
filled
with
sobs
o
cloudy
she
caught
her
aunt
hands
i
never
never
do
anything
again
you
do
want
me
to
she
sobbed
out
and
then
burst
into
another
paroxysm
of
tears
there
now
kid
do
cry
any
more
pleaded
allison
springing
to
her
side
and
kneeling
by
her
smoothing
her
hair
roughly
you
were
a
little
winner
you
had
every
bit
of
your
nerve
with
you
why
you
did
a
great
thing
kid
outwitting
those
two
brutes
and
bringing
that
girl
back
in
spite
of
herself
but
the
greatest
thing
of
all
was
your
making
her
confess
now
they
got
something
to
go
on
if
you
done
that
it
would
have
been
her
word
against
yours
and
i
imagine
she
always
managed
to
keep
things
where
she
could
get
around
people
with
her
wiles
now
she
got
to
face
facts
and
believe
me
kid
it
be
better
for
her
in
the
end
she
was
headed
straight
for
a
bad
end
and
no
mistake
all
the
fellows
knew
it
and
the
faculty
suspected
it
and
it
was
making
no
end
of
trouble
but
now
the
girl
may
be
saved
for
that
dean
never
lets
a
student
go
to
destruction
they
say
if
he
can
help
it
oh
of
course
he
fire
her
she
fit
to
be
around
here
but
he
keep
an
eye
on
her
and
he
fire
her
in
such
a
way
that
she
have
another
chance
to
make
good
if
she
willing
to
take
it
do
you
worry
about
spoiling
her
life
she
set
out
to
spoil
it
in
the
first
place
and
the
best
thing
that
could
possibly
happen
to
her
was
to
get
stopped
before
she
went
too
far
from
all
you
say
i
should
think
a
marriage
with
that
fellow
would
have
been
any
advantage
to
her
oh
he
was
allison
shuddered
leslie
he
smelled
of
liquor
and
he
had
great
coarse
lips
and
eyes
and
he
put
his
arms
around
her
and
kissed
her
right
there
before
us
all
and
they
acted
perfectly
disgusting
i
almost
sure
from
things
i
heard
them
say
that
she
had
been
engaged
to
him
at
all
she
had
even
known
him
till
last
week
she
met
him
in
town
just
picked
him
up
on
the
street
and
that
fred
hicks
i
do
now
he
was
her
cousin
at
all
probably
not
but
leave
that
all
to
the
dean
he
ferret
it
out
he
went
in
there
to
the
telephone
before
he
left
and
from
what
i
heard
i
imagine
he
got
detectives
out
after
those
two
guys
and
they
may
sleep
in
the
lockup
they
certainly
deserve
to
and
i
shall
have
a
hand
in
settling
with
them
too
i
ca
have
my
sister
treated
that
way
and
let
it
go
easily
they
got
to
answer
to
me
there
kid
he
stooped
down
and
kissed
her
gently
on
her
hot
wet
forehead
and
leslie
caught
his
hand
and
nestled
her
own
in
it
o
allison
it
so
good
to
be
home
she
murmured
squeezing
his
hand
appreciatively
i
never
never
go
with
a
girl
again
that
you
do
like
i
just
going
to
stick
to
jane
she
the
only
one
up
there
i
really
love
anyway
allison
seemed
quite
satisfied
with
these
sentiments
and
they
had
a
beautiful
time
eating
their
supper
before
the
fire
for
no
one
had
had
any
appetite
before
and
cherry
was
as
pleased
to
have
the
anxiety
over
and
wait
upon
them
all
as
if
leslie
had
been
her
own
sister
into
the
midst
of
their
little
family
group
broke
a
hurried
excited
knock
on
the
door
and
there
stood
howard
letchworth
with
anxious
face
i
heard
that
your
sister
and
one
of
the
college
girls
had
gone
off
in
a
car
and
got
lost
is
it
true
i
came
right
around
to
see
if
i
could
help
leslie
sat
up
with
her
teary
eyes
bright
and
eager
and
her
cheeks
rosy
with
pleasure
all
her
pretty
hair
in
a
tumble
about
her
face
and
the
firelight
playing
over
her
features
in
a
most
charming
way
oh
it
awfully
good
of
you
she
called
eagerly
but
i
perfectly
all
right
and
safe
he
came
over
to
the
couch
and
took
her
offered
hand
most
eagerly
expressing
his
delight
and
saying
he
had
been
almost
sure
it
was
some
town
gossip
but
he
could
not
rest
satisfied
until
he
was
positive
but
allison
would
not
let
it
go
at
that
i
going
to
tell
him
leslie
he
said
he
wo
let
any
one
be
the
wiser
and
if
people
are
saying
anything
like
that
he
can
help
stop
their
mouths
so
allison
told
the
whole
story
when
it
came
to
the
part
about
fred
hicks
and
bartram
laws
howard
face
grew
dark
and
he
flashed
a
look
that
boded
no
good
to
the
two
young
ruffians
i
know
who
that
laws
fellow
is
he
said
gravely
he
rotten
and
i
should
wonder
if
i
could
locate
his
friend
i
get
around
quite
a
bit
on
my
may
i
use
your
a
minute
i
have
a
friend
who
is
a
detective
they
ought
to
be
rounded
up
miss
leslie
would
you
tell
me
carefully
just
what
roads
you
took
as
nearly
as
you
know
so
leslie
told
in
detail
of
the
wild
ride
once
more
julia
cloud
watched
the
young
man
face
as
he
listened
and
knew
that
leslie
had
a
faithful
friend
and
champion
knew
also
that
here
was
one
whose
friendship
was
well
worth
cultivating
a
clean
fine
strong
young
soul
and
was
glad
for
her
little
girl
something
stirred
in
her
memory
as
she
watched
his
look
and
she
went
back
to
her
childish
days
and
the
boy
friend
who
had
kissed
her
when
he
went
away
never
to
return
there
was
the
same
look
in
howard
letchworth
eyes
when
he
looked
at
leslie
the
beauty
of
a
man
clean
devotion
to
a
sweet
pure
woman
soul
of
course
leslie
was
a
mere
child
yet
and
was
not
thinking
of
such
things
but
there
need
be
no
fear
that
that
fine
strong
young
man
would
be
unwise
enough
to
let
the
child
in
her
be
frightened
away
prematurely
they
were
friends
now
beautiful
friends
and
that
would
be
enough
for
them
both
for
a
long
time
she
was
content
she
watched
them
all
the
evening
and
listened
to
their
talk
about
the
christian
endeavor
society
how
beautiful
it
was
that
leslie
had
been
able
to
bring
the
boy
to
a
degree
of
interest
in
that
of
course
it
was
for
her
sake
but
he
was
man
enough
to
be
interested
on
his
own
account
now
and
from
their
talk
she
could
see
that
he
had
gone
heart
and
soul
with
allison
into
the
plans
for
the
winter
work
he
had
a
fine
voice
and
was
to
sing
a
solo
at
the
next
meeting
presently
leslie
so
far
recovered
her
nerves
as
to
smooth
out
her
hair
and
go
to
the
piano
to
practise
with
him
o
jesus
thou
art
standing
outside
the
door
rang
out
the
rich
sweet
notes
and
the
tender
sympathetic
voice
brought
out
each
word
with
an
appeal
the
boy
could
not
sing
like
that
and
not
feel
it
himself
sometime
julia
cloud
found
herself
praying
praying
as
if
she
whispered
to
a
dear
companion
sitting
close
beside
her
at
the
hearthside
dear
christ
show
this
boy
teach
him
what
thou
art
make
him
thy
true
disciple
suddenly
the
young
fellow
turned
to
allison
with
a
smile
i
like
the
way
you
take
your
religion
with
you
into
college
cloud
it
makes
it
seem
real
i
have
met
many
fellows
that
had
any
before
or
perhaps
i
should
have
been
such
a
heathen
as
i
am
but
i
say
why
do
you
try
to
get
some
of
your
frat
brothers
to
come
down
to
the
meeting
they
ought
to
be
willing
to
do
that
for
you
and
it
would
be
great
to
have
them
sing
you
got
a
lot
of
the
glee
club
in
your
crowd
that
so
said
allison
i
do
know
but
i
try
it
i
like
to
have
them
come
the
night
you
sing
guess
i
have
to
hunt
around
and
get
a
speaker
no
i
wo
either
just
the
meeting
itself
is
good
enough
now
for
anybody
they
a
pretty
good
little
bunch
down
there
they
been
working
like
beavers
jane
bristol
gets
the
girls
together
and
coaches
them
for
every
meeting
she
some
girl
do
you
know
it
howard
letchworth
agreed
that
she
was
but
he
cast
a
side
glance
down
at
the
bright
head
of
the
girl
who
was
playing
his
accompaniment
as
if
he
felt
there
were
others
julia
cloud
was
watching
her
darling
girl
wondering
hoping
praying
that
she
might
always
stay
so
sweet
and
unspoiled
but
when
the
young
man
was
gone
home
and
leslie
came
back
to
the
couch
again
she
suddenly
drooped
cloudy
jewel
she
said
wearily
it
is
right
i
do
deserve
people
to
be
so
nice
to
me
the
dean
and
you
all
and
howard
and
everybody
it
was
a
lot
my
fault
that
all
this
happened
i
thought
i
could
make
that
girl
over
if
i
just
stuck
to
her
she
had
promised
me
she
would
come
to
christian
endeavor
and
join
and
i
wanted
to
show
you
all
what
a
power
i
had
over
her
i
was
just
conceited
that
was
all
there
was
about
it
now
i
see
that
she
was
only
fooling
me
i
could
have
done
anything
at
all
alone
i
needed
god
i
did
ask
him
to
help
you
talked
a
lot
about
that
in
our
sunday
meetings
but
it
never
went
down
into
my
heart
until
i
was
driving
past
that
old
crematory
and
i
felt
as
if
i
was
all
alone
and
death
all
in
black
trailing
robes
was
going
along
fast
beside
me
then
i
knew
god
was
the
only
one
who
could
help
and
i
began
to
pray
i
hope
maybe
learned
my
lesson
and
i
not
be
so
next
time
but
you
ought
to
forgive
me
cloudy
not
so
easy
cloudy
you
just
like
god
it
was
several
days
before
leslie
recovered
fully
from
the
nervous
strain
she
had
been
under
she
slept
long
the
next
day
and
julia
cloud
would
not
waken
her
for
a
week
there
were
dark
circles
under
the
bright
eyes
and
the
rose
of
her
cheek
was
pale
she
went
about
meekly
with
downcast
eyes
and
the
bright
fervor
of
her
spirit
seemed
dimmed
it
was
not
until
one
afternoon
when
allison
suggested
that
they
get
jane
bristol
and
howard
letchworth
and
go
for
vines
and
to
decorate
for
the
christian
endeavor
social
that
her
spirits
seemed
to
return
and
the
unwholesome
experience
was
put
away
in
the
past
at
last
howard
letchworth
had
been
most
thoughtful
about
the
matter
in
the
village
and
had
managed
so
that
the
tragic
had
been
taken
out
of
the
story
that
had
started
to
roll
about
and
leslie
could
go
around
and
not
feel
that
all
eyes
were
upon
her
wondering
about
her
escapade
gradually
the
remembrance
of
it
died
out
of
her
thoughts
although
the
wholesome
lesson
she
had
learned
never
faded
more
and
more
popular
in
the
college
grew
the
gatherings
down
at
cloudy
villa
sometimes
leslie
brought
home
three
or
four
girls
for
friday
and
saturday
not
often
any
on
sunday
unless
it
was
jane
for
sundays
were
their
very
own
day
for
the
little
family
and
they
dreaded
any
who
might
seem
like
intruders
it
is
our
time
when
we
catch
up
in
our
loving
for
all
the
week
leslie
explained
with
a
quaint
smile
to
one
girl
who
broadly
hinted
that
she
would
not
mind
being
asked
for
over
sunday
and
besides
you
might
like
the
way
we
keep
sunday
everybody
who
comes
has
to
go
to
church
and
christian
endeavor
with
us
and
enjoy
our
singing
hour
around
the
fire
and
i
did
think
you
would
well
i
like
your
nerve
answered
the
girl
but
she
sat
studying
leslie
afterwards
with
a
thoughtful
gaze
and
began
to
wonder
whether
after
all
a
sunday
spent
in
that
way
might
not
be
really
interesting
she
a
kind
of
a
nut
is
she
she
remarked
to
another
friend
of
leslie
she
a
pretty
nice
kind
of
a
nut
then
esther
was
the
response
if
that
a
nut
we
better
grow
a
whole
tree
of
them
i
going
down
there
all
i
can
i
like
julia
cloud
seemed
to
have
a
fertile
brain
for
all
kinds
of
lovely
ways
to
while
away
a
holiday
as
the
cold
weather
came
on
winter
picnics
became
the
glory
of
the
hour
long
walks
with
heavy
shoes
and
warm
sweaters
and
mittens
were
inaugurated
a
kettle
of
hot
soup
straight
from
the
fire
wrapped
in
a
blanket
and
carried
in
a
big
basket
was
a
feature
of
the
lunch
when
the
party
reached
a
a
fire
would
be
built
and
the
hung
over
an
improvised
crane
to
put
on
its
finishing
touches
while
the
rest
of
the
eatables
were
set
forth
in
paper
plates
each
portion
neatly
wrapped
in
waxed
paper
ready
for
easy
handling
sometimes
big
mince
pies
came
along
and
were
stood
on
edge
near
the
fire
to
get
thawed
out
bean
soup
sandwiches
and
hot
mince
pie
made
a
hearty
meal
for
people
who
had
tramped
ten
or
fifteen
miles
since
breakfast
oh
how
those
boys
and
girls
enjoyed
these
picnics
with
julia
cloud
as
a
kind
of
hovering
angel
to
minister
with
word
or
smile
or
in
some
more
practical
way
wherever
there
was
need
they
all
called
her
cloudy
jewel
now
whenever
they
dared
and
envied
those
who
got
closest
to
her
and
told
her
their
troubles
many
a
lad
or
lassie
brought
her
his
or
her
perplexities
and
often
as
they
sat
around
the
winter
camp
perhaps
on
a
rock
brushed
free
from
snow
she
gave
them
sage
advice
wrapped
up
in
pleasant
stories
that
were
brought
in
ever
so
incidentally
there
was
nothing
ever
like
preaching
about
julia
cloud
she
did
not
feel
that
she
knew
enough
to
preach
and
sometimes
as
they
walked
homeward
through
the
twilight
of
a
long
happy
afternoon
and
the
streaks
of
crimson
were
beginning
to
glow
in
the
gray
of
the
horizon
some
one
or
two
would
lag
behind
and
ask
her
deep
sweet
questions
about
life
and
its
meaning
and
its
hereafter
often
they
showed
her
their
hearts
as
they
had
never
shown
them
even
to
their
own
people
and
often
a
word
with
her
sent
some
student
back
to
work
harder
and
fight
stronger
against
some
subtle
temptation
she
became
a
wholesome
antidote
to
the
spirit
of
doubt
and
atheism
that
had
crept
stealthily
into
the
college
and
was
attacking
so
many
and
undermining
what
little
faith
in
religion
they
had
when
they
came
there
it
came
to
be
a
great
delight
to
many
of
the
young
college
people
to
spend
an
evening
around
the
hearth
at
cloudy
villa
there
never
had
been
any
trouble
about
that
question
of
dancing
because
they
just
did
not
do
it
and
there
was
always
something
else
going
on
some
lively
games
sometimes
almost
a
as
the
boys
called
it
but
never
anything
really
unpleasant
julia
cloud
was
a
good
sport
the
boys
said
and
the
girls
delighted
in
her
the
evenings
were
filled
with
impromptu
programmes
thought
out
carefully
by
julia
cloud
but
proposed
and
exploited
in
the
most
casual
manner
allison
why
would
it
be
a
good
idea
for
you
to
act
out
that
story
we
were
reading
the
other
day
the
next
time
you
have
some
of
the
young
people
down
you
and
leslie
and
jane
with
the
help
of
one
or
two
others
could
do
it
and
there
would
be
much
to
learn
if
you
all
read
it
over
once
or
twice
more
you
have
it
so
you
could
easily
extemporize
do
you
know
i
think
there
a
hidden
lesson
in
that
story
that
would
do
some
of
those
boys
and
girls
good
if
they
could
see
it
lived
out
and
perhaps
set
them
to
reading
the
book
again
they
would
be
asked
suddenly
soon
after
their
arrival
each
one
to
represent
his
favorite
character
in
shakespeare
or
to
reproduce
some
great
public
man
so
that
they
all
could
recognize
him
and
they
would
be
sent
to
select
from
a
great
pile
of
shawls
wraps
and
all
sorts
of
garments
any
which
they
needed
for
an
improvised
costume
another
evening
there
would
be
brought
forth
a
new
game
which
nobody
had
seen
and
which
absorbed
them
all
for
perhaps
two
hours
until
some
delicious
and
unique
refreshments
would
be
produced
to
conclude
the
festivities
at
another
time
the
round
would
be
stretched
to
take
in
all
its
leaves
and
the
entire
company
would
gather
around
it
with
uplifted
thumbs
and
eager
faces
unroariously
playing
up
jenkins
for
an
hour
or
two
any
little
old
game
went
well
under
that
roof
though
julia
cloud
kept
a
controlling
mind
on
things
and
always
managed
to
change
the
game
before
anybody
was
weary
of
it
also
there
was
much
music
in
the
little
house
allison
played
the
violin
well
two
or
three
others
who
played
a
little
at
stringed
and
wind
instruments
were
discovered
and
often
the
whole
company
would
break
loose
into
song
until
people
on
the
street
halted
and
walked
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
house
to
listen
to
the
wild
sweet
harmonies
of
the
fresh
young
voices
at
the
close
of
such
an
evening
it
was
not
an
uncommon
happening
for
a
crowd
of
the
frat
boys
to
gather
in
a
knot
in
front
of
the
house
and
give
the
college
yell
with
a
tiger
at
the
end
and
then
cloud
cloud
cloud
the
people
living
on
that
street
got
used
to
it
and
opened
their
windows
to
listen
with
eyes
tender
and
thoughtful
as
they
pondered
on
how
easily
this
little
family
had
caught
the
hearts
of
those
college
people
and
were
helping
them
to
have
a
good
time
perhaps
it
entered
into
their
minds
that
other
people
might
do
the
same
thing
if
they
would
only
half
try
in
return
for
all
her
kindness
a
number
of
the
young
people
would
often
respond
to
julia
cloud
wistful
invitation
to
go
to
church
and
more
and
more
they
were
being
drawn
by
twos
and
threes
to
come
to
the
christian
endeavor
meetings
in
the
village
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
but
just
discovered
that
there
was
such
a
thing
to
the
equal
amazement
of
themselves
and
the
original
members
of
the
christian
endeavor
society
who
had
always
responded
to
any
such
suggestions
on
the
part
of
their
pastor
or
elders
with
a
hopeless
oh
you
ca
get
those
college
guys
to
do
anything
they
think
they
it
the
feeling
was
gradually
melting
away
and
a
new
brotherhood
and
sisterhood
was
springing
up
between
them
it
was
not
infrequent
now
for
a
college
maiden
to
greet
some
village
girl
with
a
frank
pleasant
smile
and
accept
invitations
to
lunch
and
dinner
and
college
boys
were
friendly
and
chummy
with
the
village
boys
who
were
not
and
often
took
them
up
to
their
frat
rooms
to
visit
so
the
two
elements
of
the
locality
were
coming
nearer
to
each
other
and
their
bond
was
the
village
christian
endeavor
society
so
passed
the
first
winter
and
spring
in
the
little
house
and
with
the
first
week
of
vacation
there
came
visitors
chapter
xxiv
guardy
lud
was
the
first
visitor
just
for
a
night
and
a
day
he
had
come
east
for
a
flying
business
trip
and
could
not
pass
by
his
beloved
wards
without
at
least
a
glimpse
he
dropped
down
into
their
midst
quite
unexpectedly
the
night
before
college
closed
and
found
them
with
a
bevy
of
young
people
at
the
who
opened
their
ranks
right
heartily
and
took
him
in
he
sat
on
the
terrace
in
the
moonlight
with
them
afterwards
joking
telling
them
stories
and
eating
chocolates
with
the
rest
when
they
gathered
about
the
piano
for
a
sing
he
joined
in
with
a
good
old
tenor
surprising
them
all
by
knowing
a
lot
of
the
songs
they
sang
after
the
young
people
were
gone
he
lingered
wiping
his
eyes
and
saying
bless
my
soul
thoughtfully
he
told
julia
cloud
over
and
over
again
how
more
than
pleased
he
was
with
what
she
had
done
for
his
children
and
insisted
that
her
salary
should
be
twice
as
large
he
told
her
she
was
a
big
success
and
should
have
more
money
at
her
command
to
do
with
as
she
pleased
and
that
he
wanted
the
children
to
have
a
larger
allowance
during
the
coming
year
allison
had
spoken
of
his
work
among
the
young
people
of
the
church
and
he
felt
that
it
would
have
been
the
wish
of
their
father
and
mother
both
that
the
young
people
should
give
liberally
toward
he
would
see
that
a
sum
was
set
aside
in
the
bank
for
their
use
in
any
such
plans
as
they
might
have
for
their
christian
endeavor
work
they
talked
far
into
the
night
for
he
had
to
hear
all
the
stories
of
all
their
doings
and
every
minute
or
two
one
or
the
other
of
the
children
would
break
in
to
tell
something
about
the
other
or
to
praise
their
dear
cloudy
jewel
for
her
part
in
everything
the
next
day
they
took
him
everywhere
and
showed
him
everything
about
the
college
and
the
place
introduced
him
to
their
favorite
professors
at
least
those
who
were
not
already
gone
on
their
vacations
and
took
him
for
a
long
drive
past
their
favorite
haunts
then
he
had
to
meet
jane
bristol
and
howard
letchworth
julia
cloud
was
greatly
relieved
and
delighted
when
he
set
his
approval
upon
both
these
young
people
as
suitable
friends
for
the
children
they
are
both
poor
and
earning
their
own
living
said
julia
cloud
feeling
that
in
view
of
the
future
and
what
it
might
contain
she
wanted
to
be
entirely
honest
that
the
weight
of
responsibility
should
not
rest
too
heavily
upon
her
all
the
better
for
that
no
doubt
said
guardy
lud
thoughtfully
watching
jane
bristol
sweet
smile
as
she
talked
over
some
committee
plans
with
allison
i
should
say
they
were
about
as
wholesome
a
couple
of
young
people
as
could
be
found
to
match
your
two
just
keep
to
that
kind
for
a
year
or
two
more
and
they
choose
that
kind
for
life
i
entirely
satisfied
with
the
work
you
doing
miss
cloud
i
could
have
found
a
better
mother
for
if
i
searched
heaven
i
sure
and
so
julia
cloud
was
well
content
to
go
on
with
her
beloved
work
as
but
the
day
after
guardy
lud
left
just
as
the
three
were
sitting
together
over
a
great
state
map
of
roads
perfecting
their
plans
for
a
wonderful
vacation
which
was
to
include
a
brief
visit
to
ellen
robinson
at
sterling
a
noisy
ford
drew
up
at
the
door
and
there
was
ellen
robinson
herself
with
the
entire
family
done
up
in
linen
and
peering
curiously
half
contemptuously
at
the
strange
architecture
of
the
villa
allison
arose
and
went
down
the
terrace
to
do
the
honors
showing
his
uncle
where
to
drive
in
and
put
his
car
in
the
little
garage
helping
his
aunt
and
the
little
cousins
to
alight
for
mercy
sake
julia
what
a
queer
house
you
got
said
ellen
the
minute
she
arrived
gazing
disapprovingly
at
the
many
windows
and
the
brick
terrace
i
should
think
take
all
your
time
to
keep
clean
what
the
idea
in
making
a
sidewalk
of
your
front
porch
looks
as
if
some
crazy
person
had
built
it
could
you
find
anything
better
than
this
in
the
town
i
saw
some
real
pretty
frame
houses
with
gardens
as
we
came
through
we
like
this
very
well
said
julia
cloud
with
her
old
patient
smile
and
the
hurt
flush
that
always
accompanied
her
answers
to
her
contempt
cherry
does
seem
to
mind
washing
windows
she
likes
to
keep
them
bright
we
find
it
very
comfortable
and
light
and
airy
come
inside
and
see
how
pretty
it
is
once
inside
ellen
robinson
was
somewhat
awed
with
the
strangeness
of
the
rooms
and
the
beauty
of
the
furnishings
but
all
she
said
after
a
prolonged
survey
was
um
no
paper
on
the
wall
that
queer
it
and
the
chimney
right
in
the
room
it
looks
as
though
they
have
plaster
enough
to
go
around
leslie
took
the
children
to
wash
their
faces
and
freshen
up
and
julia
cloud
led
her
sister
to
the
lovely
that
was
always
in
perfect
order
well
you
certainly
have
things
well
fixed
said
ellen
grudgingly
what
easy
little
stairs
it
like
child
play
going
up
i
suppose
that
one
consolation
for
having
such
a
little
playhouse
affair
to
live
in
you
do
have
to
climb
up
far
well
we
come
to
stay
two
days
if
you
want
us
herbert
said
he
could
spare
that
much
time
off
and
we
going
to
stop
in
thayerville
on
the
way
back
and
see
his
folks
a
couple
of
days
and
that
be
a
week
now
if
you
do
want
us
say
so
and
we
go
on
it
is
as
if
we
could
go
when
we
like
you
know
but
julia
cloud
was
genuinely
glad
to
see
her
sister
and
said
so
heartily
enough
to
satisfy
even
so
jealous
a
nature
as
ellen
and
so
presently
they
were
walking
about
the
pretty
rooms
together
and
ellen
was
taking
in
all
the
beauties
of
the
home
and
this
is
your
bedroom
she
paused
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
looked
about
her
taking
in
every
little
detail
with
an
eye
that
would
put
it
away
for
remembrance
long
afterwards
well
they
certainly
have
feathered
your
nest
well
she
declared
as
her
eyes
rested
on
the
luxury
everywhere
though
i
like
that
painted
furniture
much
myself
she
said
as
she
glanced
at
the
french
gray
enamel
of
the
bed
but
i
suppose
it
all
right
if
that
the
kind
of
thing
you
like
was
it
some
of
their
old
furniture
from
california
oh
no
said
julia
cloud
quickly
the
pretty
flush
coming
in
her
cheeks
everything
was
bought
new
except
a
few
little
bits
of
mahogany
we
had
such
fun
choosing
it
too
do
you
like
my
furniture
i
love
it
i
hovered
around
it
again
and
again
but
i
did
dream
of
having
it
in
my
room
it
was
so
expensive
it
real
french
enamel
you
know
and
happens
to
be
a
craze
of
fashion
at
present
i
thought
it
was
ridiculous
to
buy
it
but
leslie
insisted
that
it
was
the
only
thing
for
my
room
and
those
crazy
extravagant
children
went
and
bought
it
when
i
had
my
head
turned
you
do
say
said
ellen
robinson
putting
a
hard
investigating
finger
on
the
well
it
does
seem
sort
of
smooth
but
i
never
thought
my
chairs
were
much
guess
i
have
to
get
out
and
varnish
what
that
out
there
a
porch
julia
cloud
led
her
out
to
the
upper
porch
with
its
rush
rugs
willow
chairs
and
table
and
its
stone
wall
crowned
with
blooming
plants
and
trailing
vines
she
showed
her
the
bird
nest
in
the
tree
overhead
well
said
ellen
half
sourly
i
suppose
there
no
chance
of
your
getting
sick
of
it
all
and
coming
back
and
i
must
say
i
do
blame
you
it
certainly
is
a
contrast
from
the
way
you
lived
up
to
now
but
these
children
will
grow
up
and
get
married
and
then
where
will
you
be
i
suppose
you
have
chances
here
of
getting
married
you
the
color
flamed
into
julia
cloud
cheeks
in
good
earnest
now
i
not
looking
for
such
chances
ellen
she
said
decidedly
i
do
intend
ever
to
marry
i
happier
as
i
am
yes
but
after
these
children
are
married
what
you
do
support
you
do
let
that
worry
you
ellen
there
are
other
children
and
i
love
to
mother
them
but
as
far
as
support
is
concerned
i
putting
away
money
in
the
bank
constantly
more
than
i
ever
expected
to
have
all
together
in
life
and
i
shall
not
trouble
anybody
for
support
however
i
hope
to
be
able
to
work
for
a
good
many
years
yet
and
what
i
doing
now
i
love
shall
we
go
have
allison
and
leslie
got
any
sweethearts
yet
she
asked
pryingly
as
she
followed
her
sister
down
the
stairs
i
suppose
they
have
by
this
time
they
have
a
great
many
young
friends
and
we
have
beautiful
times
together
but
you
wo
see
many
of
them
now
college
closed
last
week
for
two
long
days
allison
and
leslie
devoted
themselves
religiously
to
their
relatives
taking
them
here
and
there
in
the
car
showing
them
over
the
college
and
the
town
and
trying
in
all
the
ways
they
knew
to
make
them
have
a
good
time
but
when
at
last
the
two
days
and
two
nights
were
over
and
the
robinsons
had
piled
into
their
car
and
started
away
with
grudging
thanks
for
the
efforts
in
their
behalf
leslie
sat
on
the
terrace
musingly
and
at
last
quite
shyly
she
said
cloudy
dear
what
makes
such
a
difference
in
people
why
are
some
so
much
harder
to
make
have
a
good
time
than
others
why
i
feel
as
if
i
lived
years
since
day
before
yesterday
and
i
do
feel
as
if
they
half
enjoyed
anything
i
really
wanted
to
make
them
happy
for
i
felt
as
if
we
taken
so
much
from
them
when
we
took
you
but
i
just
seemed
to
fail
everything
i
did
julia
cloud
smiled
i
do
know
what
it
is
dear
unless
it
is
that
some
people
have
different
ideals
and
standards
from
other
people
and
they
ca
find
their
pleasure
the
same
way
your
aunt
ellen
always
wanted
to
have
a
lot
of
people
around
and
liked
to
go
to
and
dress
a
great
deal
and
she
never
cared
for
reading
or
study
or
music
but
i
think
you
mistaken
about
their
not
having
had
a
good
time
they
appreciated
your
trying
to
do
things
for
them
i
know
for
aunt
ellen
said
to
me
that
you
were
a
very
thoughtful
girl
and
the
children
enjoyed
the
victrola
especially
the
funny
records
herbert
liked
it
that
allison
let
him
drive
his
car
when
they
went
out
they
enjoyed
the
eating
too
i
know
even
though
ellen
did
say
she
should
care
to
have
her
meals
cooked
by
a
servant
she
should
want
to
be
they
were
clean
did
she
truly
say
that
cloudy
twinkled
leslie
is
she
funny
they
both
broke
down
and
laughed
but
i
glad
they
came
cloudy
i
truly
am
it
was
nice
to
play
with
the
children
and
nice
to
have
a
home
to
show
our
relatives
and
nicest
of
all
to
have
them
see
you
how
beautiful
you
are
at
the
head
of
the
house
dear
flattering
child
said
julia
cloud
lovingly
it
is
so
good
to
know
you
feel
that
way
but
now
here
comes
allison
and
we
must
finish
up
our
plans
for
the
trip
and
get
ready
to
close
the
house
for
the
summer
they
had
a
wonderful
trip
to
mountains
and
lakes
and
seaside
staying
as
long
as
they
pleased
wherever
they
liked
and
everywhere
making
friends
and
having
good
times
but
toward
the
end
of
their
trip
the
children
began
to
get
restless
for
the
little
cottage
and
home
we
really
ought
to
get
back
and
see
how
the
christian
endeavor
society
is
getting
along
said
allison
one
day
as
they
glided
through
a
little
village
that
reminded
them
of
home
i
do
see
any
place
as
nice
as
our
town
do
you
cloudy
and
i
do
feel
quite
right
anywhere
but
home
on
sunday
do
you
for
really
all
the
christian
endeavor
societies
i
been
to
this
summer
acted
as
if
their
members
were
all
away
on
vacations
and
they
did
care
whether
school
kept
or
not
and
so
they
went
home
to
begin
another
happy
winter
but
the
very
first
day
there
came
a
rift
in
their
happiness
in
the
shape
of
the
new
professor
of
chemistry
a
man
about
julia
cloud
age
whom
ellen
robinson
had
met
on
her
visit
to
thayerville
and
told
about
her
sister
ellen
had
suggested
that
maybe
he
could
get
her
sister
to
take
him
to
board
to
this
day
julia
cloud
has
never
decided
whether
ellen
really
thought
julia
would
take
a
professor
from
the
college
to
board
or
whether
she
just
sent
him
there
as
a
joke
there
was
a
third
solution
which
julia
cloud
kept
in
the
back
of
her
mind
and
only
took
out
occasionally
with
an
angry
troubled
look
when
she
was
very
much
annoyed
it
was
that
ellen
was
still
anxious
to
have
her
sister
get
married
and
she
had
taken
this
way
to
get
her
acquainted
with
a
man
whom
she
thought
a
good
match
if
julia
had
been
sure
that
this
idea
had
entered
into
her
sister
thoughts
she
might
have
slammed
the
door
in
professor
armitage
face
that
night
when
he
had
the
audacity
to
come
and
ask
to
be
taken
into
cloudy
villa
as
a
boarder
why
the
very
idea
said
leslie
with
snapping
eyes
as
if
we
wanted
a
always
around
no
indeed
would
that
be
but
professor
armitage
like
everybody
else
who
came
once
to
cloudy
villa
liked
it
and
begged
a
thousand
pardons
for
presuming
but
came
again
and
again
until
even
the
children
began
to
like
him
in
a
way
and
did
not
in
the
least
mind
having
him
around
but
the
day
came
at
last
about
the
middle
of
the
winter
or
nearer
to
the
spring
when
leslie
and
allison
began
to
realize
that
professor
armitage
came
to
see
their
cloudy
jewel
and
they
met
in
solemn
conclave
to
talk
it
over
chapter
xxv
it
was
out
on
a
lonely
road
in
the
car
that
they
had
chosen
to
go
for
their
conference
where
there
was
no
chance
of
their
being
interrupted
and
they
whirled
away
through
the
town
and
out
to
the
long
stretch
of
whiteness
in
glum
silence
the
tears
welling
to
overflow
in
leslie
eyes
at
last
they
were
past
the
bounds
where
they
were
likely
to
meet
acquaintances
and
leslie
broke
forth
do
you
really
think
it
true
that
we
got
to
give
her
up
are
you
sure
it
has
come
to
that
allison
it
seems
perfectly
preposterous
well
you
know
if
she
cares
for
him
said
allison
gravely
we
no
right
to
hold
on
to
her
and
spoil
her
life
you
know
it
was
different
when
it
was
old
pill
bowman
this
is
a
real
man
care
for
him
how
she
possibly
care
for
him
snapped
leslie
why
he
has
a
wart
on
his
nose
and
he
snuffs
i
never
thought
of
it
before
till
last
night
but
he
does
he
snuffs
every
little
while
ugh
why
i
thought
you
liked
him
leslie
so
i
did
until
i
thought
he
wanted
cloudy
but
i
ca
see
that
i
hate
him
i
always
thought
he
was
about
the
nicest
man
in
the
faculty
except
the
dean
and
he
married
but
since
i
got
onto
the
idea
that
he
wants
cloudy
i
ca
bear
the
sight
of
him
i
went
way
round
the
block
to
keep
from
meeting
him
he
is
nice
enough
for
cloudy
allison
what
the
matter
with
him
warts
and
snuffing
do
count
if
you
love
a
person
i
like
him
i
like
him
ever
so
much
and
i
think
lonesome
he
appreciate
a
home
like
ours
you
know
what
a
wonderful
wife
cloudy
would
make
leslie
fairly
screamed
o
allison
to
think
you
have
come
to
it
that
you
to
give
up
our
lovely
home
and
have
cloudy
go
off
and
we
go
the
dear
knows
where
and
have
to
board
at
the
college
or
something
some
day
we
be
getting
married
too
i
suppose
said
allison
speculatively
his
sister
flashed
a
wise
curious
look
up
at
him
and
studied
his
face
a
minute
then
a
shade
came
over
her
own
once
more
yes
i
will
pretty
soon
you
almost
done
college
but
poor
me
i
have
to
board
for
two
whole
years
more
and
i
not
sure
i
ever
get
married
the
man
i
like
might
not
like
me
and
you
may
be
very
sure
i
not
going
to
live
on
any
no
matter
how
much
i
love
her
so
there
allison
smiled
and
put
his
arm
protectingly
around
his
sister
there
kid
you
need
get
excited
yet
awhile
it
me
and
thee
always
no
matter
how
many
wives
i
have
and
you
wo
ever
have
to
board
but
kid
i
not
willing
to
give
up
our
house
and
cloudy
and
all
i
just
thinking
that
maybe
we
to
you
know
i
guess
we
not
pigs
are
we
cloudy
has
had
a
mighty
hard
life
and
missed
a
lot
of
things
out
of
it
well
is
she
having
now
i
like
to
know
i
think
cloudy
likes
us
and
wants
to
stay
with
us
i
think
she
just
loved
the
house
and
everything
about
it
yes
i
think
so
too
but
this
is
something
bigger
than
anything
else
in
the
world
if
she
really
cares
do
you
think
we
ought
to
give
her
the
chance
i
so
if
she
really
wants
it
but
how
can
we
find
out
that
it
just
give
her
the
chance
when
armitage
comes
in
just
sneak
out
and
stay
away
and
let
her
have
a
little
time
alone
with
him
it
is
right
us
kids
always
sticking
around
we
ought
to
go
out
or
or
something
leslie
was
still
for
a
long
time
and
then
she
heaved
a
big
sigh
and
said
all
right
in
a
very
small
voice
as
they
sped
on
their
way
toward
home
there
was
hardly
a
word
more
between
them
it
was
after
supper
that
very
night
that
leslie
having
almost
frightened
julia
cloud
out
of
her
happy
calm
by
refusing
to
eat
much
supper
went
off
to
bed
with
a
headache
as
soon
as
the
professor
came
in
allison
too
said
he
had
to
go
up
to
the
college
for
a
book
he
had
forgotten
and
for
the
first
time
since
his
advent
the
professor
had
a
clear
evening
ahead
of
him
with
julia
cloud
without
anybody
else
by
but
julia
cloud
was
distraught
and
gave
him
little
attention
at
first
with
an
attitude
of
listening
directed
toward
the
floor
above
finally
she
gently
excused
herself
for
a
moment
and
hurried
up
to
leslie
room
where
she
found
a
very
damp
and
tearful
leslie
attempting
to
appear
wonderfully
calm
what
is
it
dear
child
has
something
happened
she
begged
i
know
you
must
be
sick
or
you
would
have
gone
to
bed
so
early
please
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
i
shall
send
for
the
doctor
at
once
if
you
do
then
leslie
knowing
that
her
brother
would
blame
her
if
she
spoiled
the
test
sat
up
bravely
and
tried
to
laugh
assuring
her
aunt
that
she
was
only
tired
from
studying
and
a
little
stiff
from
playing
hockey
too
long
and
she
thought
it
would
be
better
to
rest
so
she
could
be
all
right
in
the
morning
julia
cloud
only
half
reassured
by
this
unprecedented
carefulness
for
her
health
on
the
part
of
the
usually
careless
leslie
went
down
abstractedly
to
her
professor
and
wished
he
would
go
home
he
was
well
into
the
midst
of
a
most
heartfelt
and
touching
proposal
of
marriage
before
she
realized
what
was
coming
his
voice
was
low
and
pleading
and
leslie
lying
breathless
above
not
deigning
to
try
to
listen
yet
painfully
aware
of
the
change
of
tones
was
in
tortures
then
julia
cloud
pained
gentle
tones
firmly
replying
and
more
entreaty
with
brief
simple
answers
most
unexpectedly
before
an
hour
passed
leslie
heard
the
front
door
open
and
the
professor
go
out
and
pass
slowly
down
the
walk
her
heart
was
in
her
throat
beating
painfully
what
had
happened
a
quick
intuition
presented
a
possible
solution
cloudy
would
not
leave
them
while
they
were
in
college
and
had
bid
him
wait
or
perhaps
turned
him
down
altogether
how
dear
of
her
and
yet
with
quick
revulsion
of
spirit
she
began
to
pity
the
poor
lonely
man
who
could
not
have
cloudy
when
he
loved
her
a
moment
later
julia
cloud
came
softly
up
the
stairs
and
tiptoed
into
her
own
room
and
horror
of
horrors
leslie
could
hear
her
catch
her
breath
like
soft
sobbing
did
cloudy
care
then
and
had
she
turned
down
a
man
she
loved
in
order
to
stick
to
them
and
keep
her
promise
to
their
guardian
quick
as
a
flash
she
was
out
of
bed
and
pattering
barefoot
into
julia
cloud
room
cloudy
cloudy
you
are
crying
what
is
the
matter
quick
tell
me
please
julia
cloud
drew
the
girl
down
beside
her
on
the
bed
and
nestled
her
lovingly
and
close
it
nothing
dear
it
only
that
i
had
to
hurt
a
good
man
it
always
makes
me
sorry
to
have
to
hurt
any
one
leslie
nestled
closer
smoothed
her
aunt
hair
and
tried
to
think
what
to
say
but
nothing
came
she
felt
shy
about
it
finally
she
put
her
lips
up
and
touched
her
aunt
cheek
and
whispered
do
cry
cloudy
dear
and
just
then
she
heard
allison
key
in
the
lock
she
sprang
up
drew
her
about
her
and
ran
down
to
whisper
to
him
on
the
stairs
what
had
happened
well
it
plain
she
cares
whispered
allison
sadly
gravely
turning
his
face
away
from
the
light
i
say
les
we
ought
to
do
something
we
ought
to
tell
her
it
all
right
for
her
to
go
ahead
i
ca
allison
i
break
down
and
cry
i
know
i
would
i
tried
up
there
just
now
but
the
words
would
come
well
then
let
write
her
a
letter
and
we
both
sign
it
all
right
you
write
it
choked
leslie
i
sign
it
they
slipped
over
to
the
desk
in
the
porch
room
and
leslie
cuddled
into
a
big
willow
cushioned
chair
and
shivered
and
sniffed
while
allison
scratched
away
at
a
sheet
of
paper
for
a
few
minutes
then
he
handed
it
to
her
to
read
and
sign
this
was
what
he
had
written
dear
cloudy
we
see
just
how
it
is
and
we
want
you
to
know
that
we
are
willing
of
course
it
be
awfully
hard
to
lose
you
but
right
and
we
would
be
happy
not
to
have
you
be
happy
and
we
want
you
to
go
ahead
and
not
think
of
us
we
manage
all
right
somehow
and
we
love
you
and
want
to
see
you
happy
leslie
dropped
a
great
tear
on
the
page
when
she
signed
it
but
she
took
the
soft
embroidered
sleeve
of
her
nightgown
and
dabbled
it
dry
so
that
it
did
blur
the
writing
and
then
together
they
slipped
leslie
went
into
her
aunt
room
in
the
dark
and
in
a
queer
little
voice
said
cloudy
dear
here
a
note
for
you
laying
it
in
her
hand
leslie
hurried
into
her
own
room
shut
her
door
softly
and
hid
in
the
closet
so
that
julia
cloud
would
not
hear
her
sob
a
moment
later
julia
cloud
came
into
the
hall
with
a
dear
glad
ring
in
her
voice
and
called
children
where
are
you
come
here
quick
you
darlings
and
they
flocked
into
her
arms
like
lost
ducklings
you
blessed
darlings
she
said
laughing
and
crying
at
the
same
time
did
you
think
i
wanted
to
get
married
and
go
away
from
you
forever
well
you
all
wrong
i
never
do
that
you
may
get
married
and
go
away
from
me
but
i
never
go
away
from
you
till
you
send
me
and
i
wo
ever
get
married
to
any
one
on
this
earth
at
any
time
do
you
understand
i
do
want
to
get
married
they
all
went
into
julia
cloud
room
then
and
sat
down
with
her
on
her
couch
one
on
either
side
of
her
do
you
really
mean
it
cloudy
jewel
asked
leslie
happily
you
to
get
married
not
even
to
that
nice
professor
armitage
look
here
leslie
you
said
he
had
a
wart
put
in
her
brother
now
keep
still
allison
he
was
nice
all
the
time
only
i
did
like
him
to
want
our
cloudy
he
did
seem
to
be
quite
nice
enough
for
her
he
did
quite
fit
her
but
if
she
wanted
him
but
i
do
leslie
cried
julia
cloud
in
distress
i
did
are
you
really
true
cloudy
dear
you
such
a
dear
unselfish
cloudy
how
shall
we
ever
quite
be
sure
she
is
giving
him
up
just
for
us
allison
children
listen
said
julia
cloud
suddenly
putting
a
quieting
hand
on
each
young
hand
in
her
lap
i
tell
you
something
i
never
told
to
a
living
soul
there
was
that
in
her
voice
that
thrilled
them
into
silence
it
was
as
if
she
suddenly
opened
the
door
of
her
soul
and
let
them
look
in
on
her
real
self
as
only
god
saw
her
their
fingers
tightened
in
sympathy
as
she
went
on
a
long
time
ago
a
great
many
years
ago
perhaps
you
would
laugh
and
think
me
foolish
if
you
knew
how
many
oh
no
cloudy
never
said
leslie
softly
and
allison
growled
a
dissenting
note
well
there
was
some
one
whom
i
loved
who
died
that
is
all
only
i
never
could
love
anybody
that
way
again
marriage
without
a
love
like
that
is
a
desecration
o
cloudy
we
never
knew
murmured
leslie
no
one
ever
knew
dear
he
was
very
young
we
were
both
scarcely
more
than
children
i
was
only
fourteen
o
cloudy
how
beautiful
and
you
have
kept
it
all
these
years
you
tell
us
just
a
little
about
it
i
think
it
is
wonderful
you
allison
yes
wonderful
said
allison
in
that
deep
full
tone
of
his
that
revealed
a
man
soul
growing
in
the
boy
heart
there
is
very
little
to
tell
dear
he
was
a
neighbor
son
we
went
to
school
together
and
sometimes
took
walks
on
saturdays
he
rode
me
on
his
sled
and
helped
me
fasten
on
my
skates
and
carried
my
books
and
we
played
together
when
we
had
time
to
play
then
his
people
moved
away
out
west
and
he
kissed
me
and
told
me
he
was
coming
back
for
me
some
day
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
except
a
few
little
letters
then
they
stopped
and
one
day
his
grandmother
wrote
that
he
had
been
drowned
saving
the
life
of
a
little
child
can
you
understand
why
i
want
to
wait
and
be
ready
for
him
over
there
where
he
is
gone
i
keep
feeling
god
will
let
him
come
for
me
when
my
life
down
here
is
over
there
was
a
long
silence
during
which
the
young
hands
gripped
hers
closely
and
the
young
thoughts
grew
strangely
wise
with
insight
into
human
life
and
all
its
joys
and
sorrows
they
were
thinking
out
in
detail
just
what
their
aunt
had
missed
the
sweet
things
that
every
woman
hopes
for
and
thinks
about
alone
with
god
of
love
strong
care
little
children
and
a
home
she
had
missed
it
all
and
yet
she
had
its
image
in
her
heart
and
had
been
true
to
her
first
thought
of
it
all
the
years
now
when
it
was
offered
her
again
she
would
not
give
up
the
old
love
for
a
new
would
not
take
what
was
left
of
life
she
would
wait
till
the
morning
broke
and
her
boy
met
her
on
the
other
shore
suddenly
as
they
thought
strong
young
arms
encircled
her
and
held
her
close
in
a
dear
embrace
then
you
ours
cloudy
all
ours
for
the
rest
of
down
here
you
half
whispered
leslie
yes
dear
as
long
as
you
need
me
me
she
finished
we
shall
want
you
always
cloudy
said
allison
in
a
clear
voice
of
decision
put
that
down
forever
cloudy
jewel
you
are
our
mother
from
now
on
and
we
want
you
always
that
is
dear
said
julia
cloud
but
a
resignation
in
her
voice
some
day
you
will
marry
and
then
you
will
not
need
me
any
more
and
i
shall
find
something
to
do
somewhere
two
fierce
young
things
rose
up
in
arms
at
once
put
that
right
out
of
your
head
cloudy
jewel
cried
leslie
you
sha
say
it
again
if
i
thought
any
man
could
be
mean
enough
not
to
feel
as
i
do
about
you
i
would
never
marry
him
so
there
i
would
never
marry
anybody
my
wife
will
love
you
as
much
as
i
do
said
allison
with
conviction
i
shall
never
love
anybody
that
does
you
see
and
so
with
loving
arms
about
her
and
tender
words
of
fierce
assertion
they
convinced
her
at
last
and
the
bond
that
held
them
was
only
strengthened
by
the
little
tension
it
had
sustained
professor
armitage
came
no
more
to
the
little
house
but
julia
cloud
was
happy
with
her
children
and
they
were
content
together
the
happy
days
moved
on
i
do
see
how
you
get
time
for
that
christian
endeavor
society
of
yours
cloud
said
one
of
the
professors
to
allison
i
hear
the
moving
spirit
in
it
yet
you
never
fall
down
on
your
class
work
how
do
you
manage
it
i
like
to
put
some
of
my
other
students
onto
your
ways
of
planning
well
there
all
of
sunday
you
know
professor
answered
allison
promptly
i
do
give
so
very
much
more
time
except
a
here
and
there
to
a
committee
meeting
or
now
and
then
a
social
on
friday
night
when
i
otherwise
be
fooling
anyway
my
sister
and
i
cut
out
the
dances
and
put
these
social
parties
in
their
place
but
do
you
have
to
study
on
sundays
do
was
the
quick
reply
made
it
a
rule
when
i
started
in
here
at
this
college
and
have
broken
it
once
not
even
for
examinations
i
find
i
fresher
for
my
work
monday
morning
when
i
make
the
sabbath
the
professor
eyed
him
curiously
well
that
certainly
is
interesting
he
said
i
have
to
try
it
though
i
do
see
how
i
quite
manage
it
i
usually
have
to
spend
the
whole
sunday
correcting
papers
save
up
till
early
monday
morning
and
come
over
to
our
christian
endeavor
meeting
see
if
it
is
worth
while
and
then
see
how
much
more
you
can
do
monday
morning
at
five
when
you
really
rested
than
you
could
all
day
sunday
hacking
at
the
same
old
job
you
had
all
the
week
i
look
for
you
next
sunday
night
and
with
a
courteous
wave
he
was
off
with
a
lacrosse
stick
gliding
down
the
campus
like
a
wild
thing
the
professor
stood
and
watched
him
a
moment
and
then
turned
thoughtfully
up
the
asphalt
path
pondering
they
are
a
power
in
the
college
and
in
the
community
that
sister
and
brother
he
said
i
wonder
why
down
at
the
church
they
wondered
also
as
they
came
in
crowds
to
the
live
christian
endeavor
meetings
and
listened
to
the
clear
ringing
words
of
the
young
man
who
had
been
president
before
him
as
they
praises
sounded
by
his
admiring
friends
especially
the
young
man
who
had
been
president
before
him
as
they
saw
the
earnest
spirit
that
went
out
to
save
and
had
no
social
distinctions
or
classes
to
hinder
the
fraternal
interest
the
pastor
wondered
most
of
all
and
thanked
god
and
told
his
wife
that
that
endeavor
society
was
making
his
church
all
over
he
did
know
but
it
had
converted
him
again
too
the
session
wondered
as
it
listened
to
the
earnest
simple
gospel
sermons
that
the
pastor
now
preached
and
saw
his
zeal
for
bringing
men
to
the
service
of
christ
oh
they
pointed
out
the
four
young
people
the
clouds
jane
bristol
and
howard
letchworth
as
the
moving
spirits
in
the
work
and
they
admitted
some
of
them
that
prayer
had
made
the
transformation
for
there
were
not
many
of
the
original
bunch
of
young
people
who
by
this
time
had
not
been
fully
trained
to
understand
that
if
you
wanted
anything
in
the
spiritual
world
you
must
take
time
and
give
energy
to
getting
acquainted
with
god
but
if
they
could
have
gone
with
some
spirit
guide
to
find
out
the
true
secret
of
all
the
wonderful
spiritual
growth
and
power
of
that
young
people
society
they
must
have
looked
in
about
julia
cloud
fireplace
on
sabbath
afternoon
and
seen
the
four
earnest
young
people
with
their
bibles
and
julia
cloud
in
the
midst
spending
the
long
beautiful
hours
in
actual
spiritual
study
of
god
word
and
then
kneeling
and
communing
with
god
for
a
little
while
all
of
them
on
intimate
terms
with
god
they
were
actually
learning
to
delight
themselves
in
the
lord
it
was
no
wonder
that
other
people
even
outside
the
church
and
the
christian
endeavor
society
were
beginning
to
notice
the
difference
in
the
four
just
as
they
noticed
the
shining
of
moses
face
when
he
came
down
from
the
mountain
after
communing
with
god
julia
cloud
stood
at
the
window
of
her
room
one
sabbath
evening
after
such
an
afternoon
watching
the
four
children
walk
out
into
the
sunset
to
their
christian
endeavor
meeting
and
smiled
with
a
tender
light
in
her
eyes
she
had
come
to
call
them
her
children
in
her
heart
now
for
they
all
seemed
to
love
and
need
her
alike
and
for
many
a
month
though
they
seemed
not
yet
openly
aware
of
it
they
had
been
growing
more
and
more
all
in
all
to
one
another
and
she
was
glad
she
watched
them
as
they
walked
allison
ahead
with
jane
earnestly
discussing
something
jane
sweet
serious
eyes
looking
up
so
trustfully
to
allison
and
he
so
tall
and
fine
beside
her
leslie
tripping
along
like
a
bird
behind
with
howard
and
pointing
out
the
colors
in
the
sunset
which
he
watched
only
as
they
were
reflected
in
her
eyes
chapter
xxvi
howard
letchworth
settled
himself
comfortably
by
an
open
window
in
the
express
and
spread
out
the
evening
paper
turning
like
any
true
college
man
first
to
the
sporting
page
he
was
anxious
to
know
how
his
team
had
come
out
in
the
season
greatest
contest
with
another
larger
college
he
had
hoped
to
be
there
to
witness
the
game
himself
and
in
fact
the
clouds
had
invited
him
to
go
with
them
in
their
car
but
unfortunately
at
the
last
minute
a
telegram
came
from
a
firm
with
whom
he
expected
to
be
located
during
the
summer
saying
that
their
representative
would
be
in
the
city
that
afternoon
and
would
like
to
see
him
howard
had
been
obliged
to
give
up
the
day
pleasure
and
see
his
friends
start
off
without
him
now
his
business
over
he
was
returning
to
college
and
having
his
first
minute
of
leisure
to
see
how
the
game
came
out
the
train
was
crowded
for
it
was
just
at
closing
time
and
every
one
was
in
a
rush
to
get
home
engrossed
in
his
paper
he
noticed
none
of
them
until
someone
dropped
or
rather
sprawled
in
the
seat
beside
him
taking
far
more
room
than
was
really
necessary
and
making
a
lot
of
fuss
pulling
up
his
trousers
and
getting
his
patent
leather
feet
adjusted
to
suit
him
around
a
very
handsome
suitcase
which
he
crowded
unceremoniously
over
to
howard
side
of
the
floor
the
intruder
next
addressed
himself
to
the
arrangement
of
a
rich
and
striking
necktie
and
seemed
to
have
no
compunctions
about
annoying
his
neighbor
during
the
process
howard
glanced
up
in
surprise
as
a
more
strenuous
knock
than
before
jarred
his
paper
out
of
focus
he
saw
a
young
fellow
of
about
his
own
age
with
a
face
that
would
have
been
strikingly
handsome
if
it
had
not
also
been
bold
and
conceited
he
had
large
dark
eyes
set
off
by
long
curling
black
lashes
black
hair
that
crinkled
close
to
his
head
in
satiny
sleek
sheen
features
all
save
a
insolent
lip
that
gave
the
impression
of
great
and
selfishness
he
was
dressed
with
a
careful
regard
to
the
fashion
and
with
evidently
no
regard
whatever
for
cost
he
bore
the
mark
at
once
of
wealth
and
snobbishness
howard
in
spite
of
his
desire
to
look
upon
all
men
as
brothers
found
himself
disliking
him
with
a
vehemence
that
was
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
occasion
do
they
have
any
pahlah
cars
on
this
road
the
question
was
addressed
to
him
in
a
calm
insolent
tone
as
if
he
were
a
paid
servitor
of
the
road
he
looked
up
amusedly
and
eyed
the
stranger
pitingly
not
so
as
you
notice
it
he
remarked
crushingly
as
he
turned
back
to
his
paper
people
on
this
road
too
busy
to
use
but
the
stranger
did
not
crush
easily
live
far
out
he
asked
turning
his
big
bold
eyes
on
his
seatmate
and
calmly
examining
him
from
the
toe
of
a
shoe
to
the
crown
of
a
dusty
old
hat
that
howard
was
trying
to
make
last
till
the
end
of
the
season
when
he
had
finished
the
survey
his
eyes
travelled
complacently
back
to
his
own
immaculate
attire
and
his
shoes
fresh
from
the
hands
of
the
city
station
bootblack
with
a
thumb
and
finger
he
flecked
an
imaginary
bit
of
dust
from
the
knee
of
his
trousers
howard
named
the
college
town
brusquely
ah
indeed
another
survey
brief
and
significant
this
time
i
suppose
you
know
any
people
at
the
college
it
was
scarcely
a
question
more
like
a
statement
of
a
deplorable
fact
howard
was
suddenly
amused
oh
a
few
he
said
briefly
he
was
just
finishing
his
senior
year
rather
brilliantly
and
his
professors
were
more
than
proud
of
him
another
glance
seemed
to
say
in
what
capacity
but
the
elegant
youth
finally
decided
to
voice
another
question
do
happen
to
know
a
fellah
by
the
name
of
cloud
i
suppose
al
cloud
i
met
him
said
howard
with
his
eyes
still
on
his
paper
he
from
my
state
announced
the
youth
with
a
puff
of
importance
we
live
next
door
in
california
he
a
regular
guy
he
is
got
all
kinds
of
money
coming
to
him
he
be
of
age
in
a
month
or
two
now
and
then
you
see
him
start
something
he
some
spender
is
howard
made
no
comment
but
something
in
him
revolted
at
the
idea
of
talking
over
his
friend
in
such
company
i
got
to
hunt
him
up
went
on
the
young
man
not
noticing
that
his
auditor
appeared
uninterested
i
to
stay
with
him
i
was
to
send
a
telegram
but
did
think
of
it
till
it
was
almost
train
time
guess
it
wo
make
much
difference
the
clouds
always
used
to
keep
open
house
i
suppose
they
have
a
swell
place
out
here
oh
it
quite
comfortable
i
believe
howard
turned
over
a
page
of
the
paper
and
fell
to
reading
an
article
on
the
high
price
of
sugar
and
the
prospect
of
a
fall
you
ought
to
see
their
dump
out
in
cally
it
some
mansion
believe
me
there
was
anything
else
in
that
part
of
the
state
to
compare
with
it
for
miles
around
and
cahs
they
had
cahs
to
burn
the
old
man
was
just
lousy
with
gold
you
know
struck
a
rich
mine
years
ago
his
wife
had
a
pile
too
her
father
was
all
kinds
of
a
millionaire
and
left
every
bit
to
her
and
al
and
his
sister
get
everything
seen
anything
of
she
ought
to
be
a
winner
pretty
soon
she
was
a
peach
when
she
was
little
she
some
speedy
kid
we
used
to
play
together
you
know
and
our
folks
sorta
fixed
it
up
we
were
just
made
for
each
other
and
all
that
sorta
thing
you
know
but
i
know
i
not
going
to
be
bound
by
any
such
nonsense
of
course
unless
i
like
one
does
want
one
wife
to
be
such
an
awfully
good
shot
fer
instance
you
know
a
great
anger
surged
up
in
howard
soul
and
his
jaw
set
with
a
fierce
line
that
those
who
knew
him
well
had
learned
to
understand
meant
under
deep
provocation
he
would
have
liked
nothing
better
than
to
surprise
the
insolent
young
snob
with
a
blow
in
his
pretty
face
that
would
have
sent
him
sprawling
in
the
aisle
his
hands
fairly
twitched
to
give
him
the
lesson
that
he
needed
but
he
only
replied
with
a
slight
inscrutable
smile
in
one
corner
of
his
mouth
it
be
inconvenient
for
there
an
aloofness
in
his
tone
that
did
not
encourage
further
remarks
but
the
young
stranger
was
evidently
not
or
else
he
loved
to
hear
himself
babbling
i
coming
on
heah
you
know
to
look
this
college
ovah
he
drawled
if
it
suits
me
i
may
come
heah
next
yeah
got
fired
from
three
institutions
out
west
for
larking
and
father
thought
i
better
go
east
awhile
any
fun
doing
out
this
way
i
suppose
those
that
go
to
college
looking
for
it
can
find
it
answered
howard
noncommittally
well
that
what
i
looking
for
that
about
all
anybody
goes
to
college
for
anyway
that
and
making
a
lot
of
friends
believe
me
it
would
be
a
beastly
bore
if
it
was
for
that
al
cloud
used
to
be
a
lively
one
i
wager
he
into
everything
see
much
of
the
college
people
down
in
town
do
you
he
eyed
his
companion
patronizingly
you
get
in
on
some
of
the
spoahts
now
and
then
oh
occasionally
said
howard
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
he
was
captain
of
the
football
team
and
forward
in
but
it
seem
to
be
necessary
to
mention
it
any
fellows
with
any
pep
in
them
out
here
i
suppose
there
must
be
or
al
would
stay
unless
he
changed
he
used
to
keep
things
pretty
lively
that
one
reason
why
i
told
dad
i
come
out
here
i
like
a
place
with
plenty
of
ginger
it
gets
my
goat
to
be
among
a
lot
of
grinds
and
sissies
this
is
a
college
is
it
that
suits
me
all
right
if
the
girls
have
any
pep
and
are
too
straitlaced
any
place
around
here
where
you
can
go
off
and
take
a
girl
for
a
good
dinner
and
a
dash
of
life
i
could
stand
for
any
stuff
know
any
place
around
here
where
you
can
get
a
drink
of
the
real
thing
now
and
then
some
place
near
enough
to
go
to
you
know
i
shall
bring
my
cah
of
course
one
can
get
away
with
a
lot
more
stuff
if
they
have
their
own
cah
you
know
especially
where
there
girls
you
ca
pull
off
any
devilment
if
you
have
to
depend
on
hired
cahs
you
might
get
caught
i
suppose
they
have
some
pretty
spicy
times
down
at
the
frat
rooms
do
they
i
understood
the
frats
were
mostly
located
down
in
the
town
howard
suddenly
folded
his
paper
looking
squarely
in
the
limpid
eyes
of
his
seatmate
for
the
first
time
with
a
cold
searching
subduing
gaze
i
really
could
say
he
answered
coldly
oh
i
you
not
interested
in
that
sort
of
thing
not
being
in
college
said
the
other
insolently
but
al
cloud
put
me
wise
he
no
grind
i
wager
he
always
in
for
a
good
time
and
such
a
good
bluff
he
never
gets
found
out
now
i
somehow
always
get
caught
even
when
i
not
the
guilty
one
the
boy
laughed
unroariously
as
if
it
were
a
good
joke
and
his
weak
chin
seemed
to
grow
weaker
in
the
process
howard
was
growing
angry
and
haughty
but
it
was
his
way
to
be
calm
when
excited
he
did
not
laugh
with
the
stranger
instead
he
waited
until
the
joke
had
lost
its
amusement
and
then
he
turned
soberly
to
the
youth
with
as
patronizing
an
air
as
ever
the
other
had
worn
son
you
got
another
guess
coming
to
you
about
allison
cloud
you
have
the
surprise
of
your
young
life
when
you
see
him
i
imagine
why
he
been
an
a
student
ever
since
he
came
to
this
college
and
he
has
the
highest
average
this
last
semester
of
any
man
in
his
class
as
for
bluff
he
as
clear
as
crystal
and
a
prince
of
a
fellow
and
if
you
looking
for
a
spot
where
you
can
bluff
your
way
through
college
you
better
seek
elsewhere
bluff
does
go
down
in
college
we
have
student
government
and
i
happen
to
be
chairman
of
the
student
exec
just
now
you
better
change
your
tactics
if
you
expect
to
remain
here
excuse
me
i
see
a
friend
up
at
the
front
of
the
car
with
which
remarks
howard
letchworth
strode
across
the
sprawling
legs
of
his
and
departed
up
the
aisle
leaving
the
elegant
stranger
to
enjoy
the
whole
seat
and
his
own
company
thus
did
clive
terrence
introduce
himself
to
howard
letchworth
and
bring
dismay
into
the
little
clique
of
four
young
people
who
had
been
enjoying
a
most
unusually
perfect
friendship
howard
letchworth
as
he
stood
the
rest
of
the
ride
on
the
front
platform
of
the
car
conversing
with
apparent
interest
with
a
fraternity
brother
was
nevertheless
filled
with
a
growing
dismay
now
and
then
he
glanced
back
and
glared
down
the
aisle
at
the
elegant
sprawling
youth
and
wondered
how
it
was
that
a
being
as
insignificant
as
that
could
so
upset
his
equilibrium
but
the
assured
drawl
of
the
stranger
as
he
spoke
of
leslie
and
called
her
a
speedy
kid
had
made
him
boil
with
rage
he
carried
the
mood
back
to
college
with
him
and
sat
gloomily
at
the
table
thinking
the
whole
incident
over
while
the
banter
and
chaffing
went
on
about
him
unnoticed
underneath
it
all
there
was
a
deep
uneasiness
that
would
not
be
set
aside
the
young
man
had
said
that
the
clouds
were
very
wealthy
that
leslie
was
especially
so
that
when
she
was
of
age
she
would
have
a
vast
inheritance
there
had
been
no
sign
of
great
wealth
or
ostentation
in
their
living
but
if
that
were
so
then
there
was
an
insuperable
wall
between
him
and
her
it
was
strange
that
the
question
of
wealth
had
never
come
up
between
them
howard
had
known
that
they
were
comfortably
off
of
course
they
had
a
beautiful
car
and
wore
good
clothes
and
were
always
free
with
their
entertaining
but
they
lived
in
a
modest
house
and
never
made
any
pretences
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
they
were
any
better
off
than
he
might
be
some
day
if
he
worked
hard
they
never
talked
about
their
circumstances
of
course
now
he
came
to
think
about
it
there
were
fine
mahogany
pieces
of
furniture
in
the
little
house
and
wonderful
rugs
and
things
but
they
all
fitted
in
so
harmoniously
with
their
surroundings
that
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
they
might
have
cost
a
mint
of
money
they
never
cried
out
their
price
to
those
who
saw
them
they
were
simply
the
fitting
thing
in
the
fitting
place
doing
their
service
as
all
things
both
animate
and
inanimate
in
this
world
should
do
it
was
the
first
serpent
in
the
eden
of
this
wonderful
friendship
at
cloudy
villa
and
it
stung
the
young
man
to
the
soul
alone
in
his
room
that
night
he
finally
gave
up
all
pretence
at
study
and
faced
the
truth
he
had
been
drifting
in
a
delightful
dream
during
the
last
two
years
with
only
a
vague
and
alluring
idea
of
the
future
before
him
a
future
in
which
there
was
no
question
but
that
allison
cloud
and
his
sister
leslie
should
figure
intimately
now
he
was
suddenly
and
roughly
awakened
to
ask
himself
whether
he
had
any
right
to
count
on
all
this
if
these
young
people
belonged
to
the
favored
few
of
the
world
who
were
rolling
in
wealth
was
it
altogether
likely
that
when
they
finished
college
they
would
pass
out
of
this
comradely
atmosphere
into
a
world
of
their
own
with
a
new
set
of
laws
whereby
to
judge
and
choose
their
friends
and
life
companions
he
could
not
quite
imagine
allison
and
leslie
as
anything
but
the
frank
friendly
enthusiastic
comrades
they
had
been
since
he
had
known
them
and
yet
he
knew
the
world
knew
what
the
love
of
money
could
do
to
a
human
soul
for
he
had
seen
it
many
times
before
in
people
he
had
come
to
love
and
trust
who
had
grown
selfish
and
forgetful
as
soon
as
money
and
power
were
put
into
their
hands
he
had
to
confess
that
it
was
possible
also
his
own
pride
forbade
him
to
wish
to
force
himself
into
a
crowd
where
he
could
not
hold
his
own
and
pay
his
part
they
would
simply
not
be
in
his
class
at
least
not
for
many
years
to
come
and
his
heart
sank
with
desolation
it
was
then
and
not
till
then
that
the
heart
of
the
trouble
came
out
and
looked
him
in
the
face
it
was
not
that
he
could
not
be
in
their
class
that
he
could
not
keep
pace
with
allison
cloud
and
come
and
go
in
his
company
as
freely
as
he
had
done
it
was
that
he
loved
the
leslie
the
eager
earnest
wonderful
girl
she
held
his
future
happiness
in
her
little
rosy
hand
and
if
she
really
were
a
rich
girl
he
could
of
course
tell
her
now
that
he
loved
her
because
he
was
a
poor
man
he
did
expect
to
stay
poor
always
of
course
but
it
would
be
a
great
many
years
before
he
could
ever
hope
to
compete
with
anything
like
wealth
and
during
those
years
who
might
not
take
her
from
him
was
it
conceivable
that
such
a
cad
as
that
youth
who
had
boasted
himself
a
playmate
of
her
childhood
could
possibly
win
her
howard
went
out
and
sat
on
the
campus
under
a
great
shadowing
tree
he
watched
a
silver
thread
of
a
moon
slip
down
between
the
branches
and
dip
behind
the
hill
and
while
he
sat
there
he
went
through
all
the
desolation
of
a
lonely
life
the
bitterness
of
having
leslie
taken
from
him
by
one
who
was
unworthy
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
loved
her
enough
to
be
willing
to
step
aside
and
give
her
up
to
a
man
who
was
better
than
himself
but
this
little
whiffet
ugh
the
chimes
on
the
library
pealed
out
nine
reminding
him
of
his
work
half
done
yet
the
shadow
of
engulfing
sorrow
and
loss
hung
over
him
with
a
jerk
he
drew
himself
up
and
tried
to
grasp
at
common
sense
how
ridiculous
of
him
to
get
up
all
this
nightmare
out
of
a
few
minutes
talk
with
a
fellow
who
used
to
be
the
clouds
old
neighbor
he
might
not
have
been
telling
the
truth
and
anyhow
it
was
a
libel
on
friendship
to
distrust
them
all
this
way
as
though
riches
were
some
kind
of
a
disease
like
leprosy
that
set
people
apart
it
was
his
night
to
go
down
to
the
village
but
just
to
dispel
this
nonsense
and
bring
back
his
normal
state
of
mind
he
would
go
and
drop
in
on
the
clouds
for
a
few
minutes
a
sight
of
them
all
would
reassure
him
and
clear
his
brain
for
the
work
he
must
do
before
midnight
leslie
cloud
was
very
young
yet
and
much
can
happen
in
a
year
or
two
he
might
even
be
in
a
fair
way
to
make
a
fortune
himself
somewhere
who
knew
and
as
for
that
little
cad
it
was
nonsense
to
suppose
he
was
anything
to
fear
besides
it
was
time
yet
to
think
about
being
married
when
he
was
even
out
of
college
he
would
forget
it
and
work
the
harder
of
course
he
could
never
quite
go
back
and
forget
that
he
had
admitted
to
himself
that
he
was
in
love
with
leslie
but
he
would
keep
it
like
a
precious
jewel
hid
far
in
his
heart
so
carefully
locked
that
not
even
for
his
own
delight
would
he
take
it
out
to
look
at
now
at
this
time
having
thus
resolved
a
weight
seemed
to
have
rolled
from
his
shoulders
and
he
sprang
up
and
walked
with
a
quick
tread
down
to
the
village
there
was
a
cheerful
clang
of
victrolas
and
twanging
guitars
as
he
passed
the
fraternity
rooms
and
he
went
whistling
on
his
way
toward
cloudy
villa
but
as
he
neared
the
tall
arched
hedge
and
looked
eagerly
for
the
welcome
light
he
saw
that
the
big
windows
were
only
lit
by
a
soft
play
of
firelight
did
that
mean
they
were
all
sitting
in
the
firelight
around
the
hearth
a
fearful
thought
of
the
stranger
intruded
just
here
upon
his
fine
resolves
and
to
dispel
it
he
knocked
noisily
on
the
little
brass
knocker
it
was
very
still
inside
but
a
quick
electric
light
responded
to
his
knock
and
in
a
moment
he
could
hear
someone
coming
to
the
door
his
heart
leaped
could
it
be
leslie
ah
he
must
not
yet
how
wonderful
it
was
going
to
be
to
look
at
her
this
first
time
after
really
knowing
his
own
heart
in
plain
language
could
he
keep
the
joy
of
her
out
of
his
eyes
and
the
wonder
of
her
from
his
voice
then
the
door
opened
and
there
stood
cherry
in
negligée
of
flaring
rosy
cotton
crêpe
embroidered
with
gorgeous
peacocks
and
her
pigtails
in
eclipse
behind
an
arrangement
of
cheap
lace
and
pink
ribbons
no
sir
mister
howard
dey
ai
none
ob
heah
dey
got
cumpney
some
young
fellah
fum
back
to
californy
way
dey
done
tuk
him
out
to
see
de
town
howard
heart
sank
and
he
turned
his
heavy
footsteps
back
to
college
the
worst
fear
had
come
to
pass
of
course
reason
asserted
itself
and
he
told
himself
that
he
was
a
fool
a
perfect
fool
of
course
they
had
to
be
polite
to
an
old
neighbor
whether
they
liked
him
or
not
and
what
was
he
to
presume
to
judge
a
stranger
from
a
conversation
and
turn
him
down
so
completely
that
he
was
willing
to
have
his
old
friends
even
like
him
well
he
was
worse
than
he
had
thought
himself
and
something
would
have
to
be
done
about
it
what
he
did
about
it
was
to
stay
away
from
cloudy
villa
for
almost
a
week
and
when
leslie
at
last
after
repeated
efforts
to
get
hold
of
him
by
telephone
called
him
up
to
say
there
was
an
important
committee
meeting
at
the
church
which
he
ought
to
attend
he
excused
his
long
absence
by
telling
how
busy
he
had
been
of
course
he
had
been
busy
but
leslie
knew
that
he
had
always
been
busy
and
yet
had
found
time
to
come
in
often
she
was
inclined
to
be
hurt
and
just
the
least
bit
of
course
if
he
did
to
come
he
need
and
she
took
clive
terrence
driving
in
the
car
and
showed
him
all
the
wonders
of
the
surrounding
neighborhood
with
much
more
cordiality
than
she
really
felt
it
was
her
way
of
bearing
her
hurt
at
last
she
got
allison
by
himself
and
asked
him
quite
casually
why
howard
had
been
down
but
allison
in
haste
to
keep
an
appointment
with
jane
and
knowing
that
howard
enjoyed
being
down
as
much
as
they
wanted
him
had
even
noticed
the
absence
yet
oh
he
up
to
his
eyes
in
work
responded
allison
he
likely
busy
as
a
with
fleas
he
a
senior
you
know
wait
till
next
year
and
you
see
me
in
the
same
boat
and
he
hurried
away
whistling
chapter
xxvii
clive
terrence
hung
around
he
calmly
took
it
for
granted
that
the
clouds
wanted
him
as
long
as
he
condescended
to
stay
in
fact
it
would
have
troubled
him
whether
they
wanted
him
or
not
if
he
wanted
to
stay
he
had
discovered
that
leslie
was
the
very
same
kind
of
a
peach
which
her
younger
days
had
promised
her
to
be
and
there
was
plenty
of
good
fun
so
he
stayed
he
said
he
wanted
to
see
what
the
college
was
like
before
he
made
his
decision
and
day
after
day
went
by
with
apparently
no
plans
whatever
for
leaving
in
the
near
future
julia
cloud
did
like
him
she
admitted
that
much
to
herself
the
very
first
evening
and
for
that
reason
she
was
twice
as
cordial
to
him
as
she
might
have
been
if
she
had
liked
him
better
she
reasoned
that
it
was
unfair
to
take
a
sudden
dislike
that
way
and
perhaps
it
was
only
a
sign
he
needed
a
bit
of
their
home
all
the
more
so
she
made
him
welcome
and
treated
him
as
she
did
any
other
boys
who
came
but
more
and
more
as
the
days
slipped
by
she
did
not
like
him
at
first
she
was
a
bit
worried
about
his
influence
on
allison
till
she
saw
that
he
merely
annoyed
allison
then
she
began
to
be
annoyed
by
his
constant
attendance
on
leslie
and
finally
she
grew
exceedingly
restless
and
anxious
as
day
succeeded
day
and
howard
came
no
more
finally
one
evening
just
before
dinner
she
went
to
the
and
called
up
the
college
it
happened
that
she
caught
howard
just
as
he
was
going
down
to
dinner
she
told
him
they
were
homesick
for
him
and
there
was
roast
lamb
and
green
peas
and
strawberry
shortcake
for
dinner
would
he
come
he
came
who
could
refuse
julia
cloud
but
the
face
of
clive
terrence
was
a
study
when
unannounced
howard
entered
the
julia
cloud
had
seen
him
coming
and
quietly
opened
the
door
such
a
storm
of
delighted
welcome
as
met
him
warmed
his
heart
and
dispelled
the
evil
spirits
that
had
haunted
him
during
the
week
in
the
chatter
of
talk
while
they
were
being
seated
at
the
dinner
table
the
visitor
was
almost
forgotten
and
he
sat
watching
them
glumly
while
allison
and
leslie
eagerly
discussed
plans
for
some
society
in
which
they
seemed
to
be
interested
at
last
he
grew
weary
of
being
ignored
and
in
the
first
pause
he
languidly
drawled
leslie
i
think
you
and
i
take
the
cah
and
go
in
town
to
a
show
this
evening
i
bored
to
death
leslie
looked
at
him
with
flashing
eyes
and
then
extinguished
him
with
her
cool
tone
do
you
well
think
again
i
having
a
lovely
time
and
went
on
talking
to
howard
about
the
senior
play
that
was
to
come
off
the
next
week
it
did
not
suit
clive
in
the
least
to
be
ignored
so
he
started
in
to
tell
about
other
senior
plays
in
other
colleges
where
he
had
been
and
quite
made
himself
the
centre
of
the
stage
laughing
at
his
own
jokes
and
addressing
all
his
remarks
to
leslie
until
her
cheeks
grew
hot
with
annoyance
she
wanted
so
to
hear
what
howard
and
allison
were
talking
about
in
low
grave
tones
she
watched
the
strong
fine
face
of
howard
letchworth
and
it
suddenly
came
over
her
that
he
seemed
very
far
away
from
her
like
a
friend
who
used
to
be
but
had
moved
away
something
in
her
throat
hurt
and
a
sinking
feeling
came
in
her
heart
like
a
flash
it
came
to
her
that
howard
letchworth
would
be
graduated
in
three
more
weeks
and
perhaps
would
go
away
then
and
they
would
see
him
no
more
she
caught
a
word
or
two
now
and
then
as
he
talked
to
allison
that
indicated
that
he
was
seriously
contemplating
such
a
possibility
yet
he
had
not
said
a
word
to
her
about
it
and
they
had
been
such
good
friends
a
grieved
look
began
to
grow
around
her
expressive
little
cupid
bow
of
a
mouth
and
her
big
eyes
grew
sorrowful
as
she
watched
the
two
she
was
not
listening
to
clive
who
drawled
on
unaware
of
her
inattention
suddenly
leslie
became
aware
that
clive
had
risen
and
was
standing
over
her
with
something
in
his
hand
which
he
had
taken
from
his
vest
something
small
and
shining
and
he
was
saying
want
to
wear
it
les
here
i
put
it
on
you
then
everybody
will
think
we
are
engaged
it
was
his
fraternity
pin
he
was
holding
out
with
smiling
assurance
and
the
significance
of
his
words
came
over
her
as
a
sentence
read
without
comprehension
will
suddenly
recall
itself
and
pierce
into
the
realization
with
a
stifled
cry
she
sprang
away
from
him
mercy
no
clive
i
did
know
you
were
so
silly
i
never
wear
fraternity
pins
i
think
such
things
are
too
sacred
to
be
trifled
with
this
was
what
she
said
but
she
was
miserably
aware
that
howard
had
turned
away
and
picked
up
his
hat
just
as
clive
had
leaned
over
her
with
the
pin
and
almost
immediately
he
left
he
had
been
so
engrossed
with
his
talk
with
allison
that
he
had
not
seemed
to
see
her
repulsion
of
clive
and
his
manner
toward
her
as
he
bade
her
was
cool
and
distant
all
the
pleasant
intimacy
of
all
the
months
together
seemed
suddenly
wiped
out
and
howard
a
stranger
she
felt
herself
a
miserably
unhappy
little
girl
julia
cloud
from
the
advantage
of
the
where
she
was
doing
little
things
for
the
next
day
watched
the
drama
with
a
heavy
heart
what
had
come
between
her
children
and
what
could
she
do
about
it
the
only
comforting
thing
about
it
seemed
to
be
that
each
was
as
unhappy
as
the
other
could
it
be
that
howard
letchworth
was
jealous
of
this
spoiled
son
of
fortune
who
was
visiting
them
surely
not
yet
what
made
him
act
in
this
ridiculous
fashion
she
felt
like
shaking
him
even
while
she
pitied
him
she
calling
him
back
and
trying
to
find
out
what
was
the
matter
but
gave
it
up
after
all
what
could
she
do
leslie
as
the
door
closed
behind
howard
turned
with
one
dagger
look
at
clive
and
dashed
to
her
room
where
she
locked
herself
in
and
cried
till
her
eyes
were
too
swollen
for
study
but
she
only
told
julia
cloud
when
she
came
up
gently
to
inquire
that
she
had
a
bad
headache
and
wanted
to
go
to
bed
julia
cloud
kneeling
beside
her
gray
couch
a
little
later
laying
all
her
troubles
on
the
one
who
was
her
strength
found
it
hard
not
to
emphasize
her
dislike
even
in
prayer
toward
the
useless
little
excuse
for
a
young
man
who
was
lolling
reading
a
novel
and
smoking
innumerable
cigarettes
in
spite
of
her
expressed
wish
to
the
contrary
the
first
sunday
after
young
terrence
arrival
it
rained
and
was
very
dismal
and
cold
for
spring
howard
had
been
asked
to
go
to
a
nearby
reform
school
for
the
afternoon
and
speak
to
the
boys
and
jane
was
caring
for
a
little
child
whose
mother
was
ill
in
the
hospital
leslie
was
unhappy
and
restless
wandering
from
window
to
window
looking
out
their
guest
had
chosen
to
remain
in
bed
that
morning
so
relieving
them
from
the
necessity
of
trying
to
get
him
to
go
to
church
but
he
was
on
hand
for
lunch
in
immaculate
attire
apparently
ready
for
a
holiday
there
was
a
cozy
fire
on
the
hearth
and
he
lolled
luxuriously
in
an
seemingly
well
pleased
with
himself
and
all
the
world
julia
cloud
wondered
just
what
she
would
better
do
about
the
afternoon
hour
with
this
uncongenial
guest
on
hand
but
leslie
and
allison
after
a
hasty
whispered
consultation
in
the
with
numerous
dubious
glances
toward
the
guest
ending
in
wry
faces
came
and
settled
down
with
their
bibles
as
usual
there
was
a
loyalty
in
the
quiet
act
that
almost
brought
the
tears
to
julia
cloud
eyes
and
she
rewarded
them
with
a
loving
understanding
smile
but
when
the
guest
was
asked
to
join
the
little
circle
he
only
stared
in
amazement
he
had
no
idea
of
trying
to
conform
to
their
habits
thanks
no
i
hate
reading
aloud
books
always
bore
me
anyway
the
oh
no
count
me
out
and
he
swung
one
leg
over
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
picked
up
the
sunday
illustrated
supplement
which
he
had
gone
out
and
purchased
and
which
was
now
strewn
all
about
the
floor
he
continued
for
sometime
to
rattle
the
paper
and
whistle
in
a
low
tone
rudely
while
the
reading
went
on
then
he
threw
down
his
paper
and
lighted
a
cigarette
but
that
did
not
seem
to
soothe
his
nerves
sufficiently
so
he
strolled
over
to
the
piano
and
began
to
drum
bits
of
popular
airs
and
sing
in
a
high
nasal
tone
that
he
was
pleased
to
call
whiskey
tenor
julia
cloud
with
a
despairing
glance
at
him
finally
closed
her
book
and
suggested
that
they
had
read
enough
for
that
day
and
the
little
audience
drifted
away
unhappily
to
their
rooms
leslie
did
not
come
down
again
all
the
afternoon
until
just
time
for
christian
endeavor
young
terrence
by
this
time
was
reduced
to
almost
affability
and
looked
up
hopefully
he
was
about
to
propose
a
game
of
cards
but
when
he
saw
leslie
attired
in
raincoat
and
hat
he
stared
great
scott
you
do
have
to
go
up
to
college
do
you
it
raining
cats
and
dogs
allison
and
i
are
going
to
christian
endeavor
answered
leslie
quietly
would
you
like
to
go
she
had
been
trying
to
school
herself
to
give
this
invitation
because
she
thought
she
ought
to
but
she
hoped
sincerely
it
would
not
be
accepted
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
not
bear
to
have
the
whole
day
spoiled
for
answer
young
terrence
laughed
extravagantly
christian
endeavor
what
the
little
old
idea
better
come
and
find
out
said
allison
coming
just
then
ready
leslie
we
have
to
hustle
it
getting
late
in
alarm
at
the
idea
of
spending
any
more
time
alone
the
young
man
arose
most
unexpectedly
oh
sure
i
go
anything
for
a
little
fun
and
he
joined
them
in
a
moment
more
clad
in
rubber
coat
and
storm
hat
leslie
could
scarcely
keep
back
the
tears
as
she
walked
beside
him
through
the
dark
street
not
listening
to
his
boasting
about
riding
the
waves
in
hawaii
suppose
howard
was
at
meeting
he
would
think
what
would
he
think
and
of
course
howard
was
at
the
meeting
that
night
for
he
happened
to
be
the
leader
leslie
cheeks
burned
as
she
sat
down
and
saw
that
clive
had
manoeuvred
to
sit
beside
her
she
tried
to
catch
eyes
and
fling
a
greeting
to
him
but
he
seemed
not
to
see
his
old
friends
and
to
be
utterly
absorbed
in
hunting
up
hymns
the
first
song
had
scarcely
died
away
before
clive
began
a
conversation
with
a
low
growl
making
remarks
of
what
he
apparently
considered
a
comic
nature
about
everything
and
everybody
in
the
room
with
a
distinctness
that
made
them
entirely
audible
to
those
seated
around
them
leslie
cheeks
flamed
and
her
eyes
flashed
angrily
but
he
only
seemed
to
enjoy
it
the
more
and
kept
on
with
his
running
commentary
for
pity
sake
clive
keep
still
ca
you
whispered
leslie
anxiously
they
will
think
you
never
had
any
bringing
up
i
should
worry
shrugged
the
amiable
clive
comically
with
a
motion
of
his
handsome
shoulders
that
sent
two
susceptible
young
things
near
him
into
a
series
of
poorly
suppressed
giggles
clive
looked
up
and
gravely
winked
at
them
and
the
two
bent
down
their
heads
in
sudden
hopeless
mirth
clive
was
delighted
he
was
having
a
grand
time
he
could
see
that
the
leader
was
annoyed
and
disgusted
this
was
balm
to
his
bored
soul
he
made
more
remarks
under
cover
of
a
bowed
head
during
the
prayer
and
stole
glances
at
the
two
giggling
neighbors
then
he
nudged
leslie
and
endeavored
to
get
her
to
join
in
the
mirth
poor
leslie
with
her
burning
cheeks
her
brimming
eyes
and
her
angry
heart
her
last
vision
of
the
leader
as
she
bowed
her
head
had
been
a
haughty
annoyed
glance
in
their
direction
as
he
said
let
us
pray
she
felt
that
she
could
not
stand
another
minute
of
this
torture
almost
she
felt
she
must
get
up
and
go
out
and
she
made
a
hasty
little
movement
to
carry
out
the
impulse
and
then
suddenly
it
came
to
her
that
if
she
went
clive
would
follow
her
and
it
would
look
to
howard
as
if
she
had
created
the
disturbance
and
they
had
gone
off
together
to
have
a
good
time
so
she
settled
down
to
endure
the
rest
of
the
meeting
lifting
miserable
eyes
of
appeal
to
allison
as
soon
as
the
prayer
was
ended
if
only
there
had
been
a
seat
vacant
up
front
somewhere
a
single
seat
with
no
other
near
it
where
her
tormentor
could
not
follow
she
would
have
gone
to
it
swiftly
but
the
seats
were
all
filled
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
sit
still
and
frown
her
disapproval
perhaps
allison
might
have
done
something
to
quiet
the
guest
if
he
had
noticed
but
allison
was
at
the
moment
of
leslie
appeal
deeply
wrapped
in
setting
down
a
few
items
which
must
be
announced
and
he
almost
immediately
arose
and
went
forward
with
his
slip
of
paper
and
held
a
whispered
converse
with
howard
letchworth
during
the
hymn
that
followed
afterwards
taking
a
chair
down
from
the
platform
and
placing
it
beside
the
chairman
of
an
important
committee
that
he
might
consult
with
him
about
something
during
this
sudden
move
on
the
part
of
allison
clive
terrence
did
have
his
attention
turned
aside
somewhat
from
his
for
he
was
watching
allison
with
an
amazed
expression
not
anything
that
he
had
seen
since
coming
to
the
town
had
so
astonished
him
as
to
see
this
young
man
of
wealth
and
position
and
undoubted
strength
of
will
and
purpose
get
up
in
a
church
and
go
forward
as
if
he
had
some
business
in
the
affair
he
sat
up
with
his
loose
handsome
under
lip
in
surprise
and
watched
allison
with
a
curious
startled
expression
and
when
a
moment
later
the
leader
said
quietly
our
president
has
a
message
for
us
and
allison
arose
and
faced
the
crowded
room
with
an
eager
spirited
interested
look
on
his
face
and
began
to
talk
earnestly
outlining
a
plan
for
a
deeper
spiritual
life
among
the
members
his
expression
was
one
of
utter
bewilderment
as
if
he
suddenly
saw
trees
walking
about
the
streets
or
inanimate
objects
beginning
to
show
signs
of
intellect
he
was
thinking
that
allison
cloud
certainly
had
changed
and
was
wondering
what
on
earth
had
brought
it
about
it
could
be
any
line
that
his
guardian
had
on
him
for
he
was
a
thousand
miles
away
was
it
that
little
quiet
insipid
mouse
of
an
aunt
that
had
done
it
she
must
be
rich
or
something
the
way
the
brother
and
sister
seemed
to
be
tied
to
her
where
did
al
cloud
get
that
line
of
talk
he
was
handing
out
anyway
why
he
talked
about
god
as
if
he
were
an
intimate
friend
of
his
and
spoke
of
prayer
and
bible
reading
in
the
way
common
ordinary
people
talked
of
going
to
breakfast
or
eating
candy
as
if
they
were
necessary
and
pleasurable
acts
why
it
was
inconceivable
what
was
he
doing
it
for
there
must
be
a
reason
for
fully
five
minutes
he
sat
quiet
in
puzzled
thought
watching
this
strange
gathering
gradually
taking
it
in
that
they
were
all
taking
part
in
the
proceedings
and
that
they
seemed
interested
and
eager
why
even
those
two
giggling
girls
who
had
fallen
so
readily
for
his
nonsense
had
sobered
down
and
one
read
a
verse
from
the
bible
while
the
other
repeated
a
verse
of
poetry
he
turned
and
blinked
at
them
in
wonder
what
had
so
influenced
them
that
they
all
fell
in
line
and
performed
their
part
as
if
it
were
being
rehearsed
for
his
benefit
what
was
the
motive
power
the
query
interested
him
to
the
point
of
good
behavior
all
through
the
remainder
of
the
meeting
and
while
he
was
standing
waiting
for
allison
and
leslie
at
the
close
it
seemed
that
somehow
there
was
a
real
interest
for
they
lingered
as
if
there
were
vital
matters
to
discuss
and
leslie
was
the
centre
of
a
group
of
quite
girls
it
must
be
some
sort
of
social
settlement
work
or
other
connected
with
the
church
and
someone
had
induced
these
two
who
were
to
his
thinking
of
a
higher
order
of
being
by
right
of
wealth
and
social
position
to
take
an
interest
and
run
this
society
or
whatever
it
was
he
could
not
make
it
out
at
all
he
was
much
disgusted
that
the
young
people
insisted
on
staying
to
church
and
had
a
bad
hour
living
through
it
although
he
was
surprised
to
find
it
as
interesting
as
it
was
the
minister
seemed
quite
human
and
they
had
a
great
deal
of
singing
still
it
was
all
a
bore
of
course
he
found
a
great
many
things
in
life
to
bore
him
as
soon
as
he
and
allison
were
out
on
the
street
he
broached
the
subject
what
the
little
old
idea
old
man
are
you
a
sort
of
grand
mogul
or
high
priest
or
something
to
this
mob
and
what
do
you
get
out
of
it
allison
turned
and
looked
solemnly
at
him
through
the
dark
and
answered
with
a
kind
of
glow
in
his
voice
that
seemed
to
lighten
his
face
and
puzzled
the
questioner
more
than
all
that
had
gone
before
i
just
one
of
them
son
and
it
happens
to
be
my
turn
just
now
to
be
presiding
officer
but
i
get
out
of
it
more
than
i
ever
got
out
of
anything
in
life
before
oh
said
clive
inanely
quite
at
a
loss
to
know
what
he
meant
i
never
knew
before
that
people
could
know
god
personally
be
his
pal
sort
of
you
know
and
work
with
him
and
it
been
great
added
allison
oh
said
clive
once
more
quite
weakly
not
knowing
what
else
to
say
and
they
walked
on
for
almost
a
block
without
speaking
another
word
clive
was
thinking
that
certainly
allison
had
changed
as
that
unmannerly
chump
on
the
train
had
said
changed
most
perplexingly
and
peculiarly
but
allison
had
forgotten
almost
that
clive
was
there
he
was
thinking
over
some
good
news
he
had
to
tell
jane
about
a
protégé
of
hers
who
had
taken
a
shy
part
in
the
meeting
and
wondering
if
he
could
get
away
for
a
few
minutes
to
run
up
and
tell
her
or
if
it
would
be
better
to
call
her
up
on
the
howard
letchworth
had
not
come
home
with
them
he
had
whispered
a
hurried
excuse
to
allison
about
someone
he
had
to
see
up
at
college
before
they
left
for
the
city
and
hurried
away
at
the
close
of
the
meeting
and
leslie
with
a
choking
feeling
in
her
throat
and
burning
tears
held
back
from
her
eyes
by
mighty
effort
announced
to
allison
that
she
was
coming
home
just
now
she
was
going
to
stay
for
a
little
after
prayer
meeting
the
lookout
committee
were
having
she
would
walk
home
with
the
martins
who
went
right
by
their
door
for
leslie
was
done
with
clive
terrence
and
she
wanted
him
to
understand
it
so
clive
was
landed
at
home
with
julia
cloud
for
companion
who
had
not
gone
to
church
on
account
of
staying
to
nurse
cherry
who
had
taken
a
bad
cold
and
needed
medicine
allison
hurried
away
to
give
jane
her
message
and
there
was
nothing
for
clive
to
do
but
to
go
to
bed
and
resolve
never
to
spend
another
sunday
in
such
boredom
for
he
could
see
hobnobbing
with
an
old
woman
as
he
called
julia
cloud
the
way
the
others
seemed
entirely
willing
to
do
what
was
she
anyway
but
some
poor
relation
likely
who
was
acting
as
housekeeper
but
at
least
for
once
in
his
life
clive
terrence
realized
that
there
was
such
a
thing
in
the
world
as
a
live
religion
and
a
few
people
who
held
to
it
and
loved
it
and
it
he
could
understand
it
but
he
had
to
admit
it
although
he
was
convinced
that
behind
it
all
there
must
be
some
ulterior
motive
or
those
people
would
never
bother
themselves
to
that
extent
but
leslie
came
home
from
the
church
with
a
heavy
heart
and
crept
up
to
her
room
with
bravely
cheerful
smiles
to
deceive
julia
cloud
and
then
cried
herself
to
sleep
while
julia
cloud
kept
her
own
counsel
and
carried
her
perplexities
to
the
throne
of
god
chapter
xxviii
during
the
next
three
days
there
were
stirring
times
and
leslie
even
with
a
heavy
heart
was
kept
busy
clive
terrence
was
ignored
as
utterly
as
if
he
had
been
a
fly
on
the
ceiling
and
leslie
managed
to
keep
every
minute
full
moreover
her
mind
was
so
much
occupied
with
other
things
that
she
had
not
time
to
realize
how
fully
she
was
cutting
their
guest
out
of
sight
of
her
nor
how
utterly
amazed
it
made
him
he
was
not
accustomed
to
being
ignored
by
young
ladies
even
though
they
were
both
beautiful
and
rich
he
felt
that
he
was
quite
ornamental
himself
and
had
plenty
of
money
too
and
he
could
not
brook
any
such
treatment
so
he
set
himself
to
procure
revenge
by
going
after
the
freshman
vamp
who
to
tell
the
truth
was
much
more
in
his
style
than
leslie
and
quite
willing
though
leslie
dear
child
was
too
absorbed
to
know
it
she
came
home
at
lunchtime
a
bit
late
and
called
allison
from
the
table
to
give
him
an
excited
account
in
a
low
tone
of
something
that
had
happened
that
morning
julia
cloud
from
her
vantage
point
at
the
head
of
the
table
could
see
the
flash
in
her
eye
and
the
brilliant
flush
of
the
soft
cheeks
as
she
talked
and
wondered
what
new
trouble
had
come
to
the
dear
child
then
she
noted
the
sudden
stern
set
of
allison
jaw
and
the
squaring
of
shoulder
as
he
listened
and
questioned
meanwhile
she
passed
clive
terrence
the
muffins
and
jam
and
urged
more
and
a
hot
stuffed
potato
and
kept
up
a
pleasant
hum
of
talk
so
that
the
excited
words
should
not
be
heard
in
the
jane
had
a
perfectly
terrible
time
had
been
leslie
opening
sentence
and
we
got
to
do
something
about
it
those
little
in
the
aou
have
done
the
meanest
thing
you
can
think
of
jane
looked
just
they
hauled
up
that
old
stuff
about
her
father
being
a
forger
and
urged
it
as
a
reason
that
she
should
be
made
treasurer
in
place
of
anne
dallas
who
is
leaving
on
account
of
the
death
of
her
father
and
she
has
to
go
home
and
take
care
of
her
little
sisters
and
jane
heard
them
a
low
growl
of
indignation
reached
julia
cloud
ears
from
allison
who
squared
his
shoulders
into
position
for
immediate
action
they
said
went
on
leslie
in
excited
whisper
they
said
that
since
we
had
such
a
large
sum
to
look
out
for
now
that
the
subscriptions
for
the
sorority
house
were
coming
in
we
should
put
in
a
treasurer
of
tried
and
true
integrity
yes
they
used
just
those
words
and
true
think
of
it
and
our
jane
the
idea
the
catty
little
snobs
the
jealous
little
no
it
was
eugenia
frazer
who
it
it
was
eunice
brice
but
i
certain
she
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
for
she
sat
with
her
nice
smug
little
painted
face
as
sweet
and
complacent
as
an
angel
all
the
time
it
was
going
on
and
she
the
just
like
that
with
a
smile
too
she
said
she
fully
agreed
with
what
miss
brice
had
said
h
as
if
every
one
did
know
she
had
started
it
and
got
it
all
fixed
up
with
enough
girls
to
carry
the
motion
before
the
rest
of
us
got
down
from
an
exam
yes
they
had
it
thought
out
as
carefully
as
that
they
knew
all
the
sophomore
girls
would
be
up
in
that
exam
till
almost
twelve
for
it
always
as
long
as
the
moral
law
anything
with
professor
crabbs
and
they
counted
up
and
had
just
enough
to
a
name
to
carry
their
motion
they
even
got
marian
hobbs
to
cut
a
class
to
get
there
they
had
counted
on
my
getting
in
in
time
to
hear
i
guess
or
else
they
did
care
perhaps
they
wanted
me
to
hear
it
all
i
sure
i
do
know
i
suppose
that
must
have
been
it
they
thought
perhaps
i
tell
and
that
would
stop
you
from
going
with
jane
you
know
eugenia
and
eunice
are
both
crazy
about
you
especially
eugenia
an
impatient
exclamation
from
allison
reached
the
thunderously
where
was
jane
julia
cloud
caught
that
anxious
question
and
then
clive
who
had
evidently
heard
also
roused
himself
to
ask
a
question
who
is
this
person
they
talk
so
much
about
i
do
seem
to
have
seen
her
where
is
she
she
is
miss
bristol
said
julia
cloud
stiffening
just
a
little
at
the
young
fellow
tone
of
insolence
she
is
in
college
and
very
busy
but
has
been
unusually
busy
since
you
have
been
here
because
she
is
caring
for
a
little
child
whose
mother
has
been
very
oh
you
mean
she
a
sort
of
sehvant
he
drawled
the
question
most
offensively
and
julia
cloud
had
a
sudden
ridiculous
impulse
to
seize
his
sleek
shoulder
and
shake
him
instead
she
only
smiled
and
quoted
a
bible
verse
i
have
seen
servants
upon
horses
and
princes
walking
as
servants
upon
the
earth
clive
eyed
her
with
a
puzzled
expression
i
do
getcha
he
answered
finally
but
julia
cloud
made
no
further
comment
than
to
pass
him
a
second
cup
of
coffee
she
could
hear
the
soft
excited
whispers
still
going
on
in
the
and
she
longed
to
fly
in
there
and
leave
this
guest
to
his
own
devices
for
she
knew
something
must
have
happened
to
trouble
her
children
and
that
if
this
intruder
were
not
present
she
would
be
at
once
taken
into
their
confidence
still
she
had
to
sit
and
smile
and
keep
him
from
hearing
them
leslie
was
talking
more
softly
now
with
cautious
looks
toward
the
jane
had
finished
her
exam
and
hurried
down
because
she
thought
there
would
be
a
lot
of
business
and
she
wanted
emily
reeder
to
be
put
in
treasurer
and
was
trying
to
work
it
and
had
an
idea
alice
and
i
were
working
it
to
put
in
we
did
think
she
would
get
there
and
meant
to
have
it
all
finished
before
she
came
but
someone
turned
around
and
gave
a
queer
little
cough
just
as
eunice
finished
her
nasty
speech
and
we
all
turned
quickly
and
there
in
the
open
door
stood
jane
as
white
as
a
sheet
with
her
great
big
blue
eyes
looking
black
as
coals
and
such
suffering
i
never
saw
in
a
human
face
and
she
just
stood
and
looked
at
them
all
a
hurt
loving
searching
look
as
if
she
was
reading
their
souls
and
no
one
spoke
nor
moved
only
eunice
who
got
very
red
and
eugenia
who
straightened
up
and
got
haughty
and
hateful
looking
as
if
she
was
glad
jane
heard
it
all
she
had
a
kind
of
glitter
in
her
eyes
like
triumph
and
it
was
very
still
for
a
whole
minute
and
then
jane
put
out
her
hands
in
a
little
quick
pleading
motion
and
turned
away
quickly
and
was
gone
and
what
did
you
do
allison
tone
had
hope
threat
condemnation
and
praise
all
held
in
abeyance
on
her
answer
leslie
drew
herself
up
eagerly
her
eyes
shining
i
oh
i
wanted
to
run
after
her
and
comfort
her
but
i
had
something
else
to
do
i
jumped
up
and
offered
my
resignation
to
the
aou
and
said
i
wished
to
withdraw
my
subscription
to
the
sorority
house
that
i
could
have
anything
to
do
with
a
bunch
of
girls
that
would
stand
for
a
thing
as
contemptible
and
mean
as
that
of
course
said
allison
with
a
proud
look
at
his
sister
and
phoebe
kemp
jumped
up
and
withdrew
hers
until
they
all
apologized
to
jane
and
then
alice
lowe
said
she
have
to
withdraw
hers
too
she
given
the
highest
amount
subscribed
you
know
she
has
slews
of
money
all
in
her
own
right
because
she
of
age
you
know
and
then
the
girls
began
to
get
scared
and
elsie
dare
got
right
up
and
said
she
thought
there
had
been
some
kind
of
a
mistake
a
blunder
they
must
get
excited
they
must
begin
all
over
and
somebody
must
go
after
jane
and
bring
her
back
and
explain
as
if
there
was
any
way
to
explain
a
bold
bare
insult
like
that
and
they
sent
a
committee
after
her
they
wanted
me
to
go
but
i
declined
to
go
in
their
name
i
said
i
had
handed
in
my
resignation
and
i
was
one
of
them
any
more
and
they
might
send
somebody
who
would
better
represent
them
and
they
said
they
had
accepted
my
resignation
and
a
lot
of
stuff
but
they
sent
off
a
committee
to
find
jane
and
they
tried
to
think
up
something
quickly
to
say
to
her
and
they
got
eunice
brice
to
crying
and
made
eugenia
real
mad
so
the
powder
came
off
her
nose
from
rubbing
it
so
much
and
i
came
away
i
been
hunting
for
jane
for
half
an
hour
but
i
ca
find
her
in
any
of
the
places
she
always
is
and
i
thought
i
better
come
and
tell
you
that
right
i
find
her
allison
made
one
step
to
the
and
took
his
hat
then
raising
his
voice
cloudy
i
been
called
away
on
business
suddenly
do
bother
keeping
anything
for
me
i
had
all
i
want
and
he
was
gone
julia
cloud
gave
a
glance
at
allison
plate
and
saw
that
he
had
scarcely
touched
his
lunch
and
she
sighed
as
she
heard
leslie
run
quickly
up
the
stairs
and
shut
the
door
of
her
own
room
was
leslie
going
to
spend
the
afternoon
in
weeping
but
leslie
was
down
again
in
a
moment
and
standing
in
the
doorway
her
curls
tumbled
her
eyes
bright
and
anxious
an
indignant
little
set
of
lips
and
chin
giving
her
a
worried
expression
jewel
dear
i
got
to
go
there
something
important
on
tell
you
about
it
all
when
i
get
back
no
please
i
could
eat
now
you
get
cherry
to
save
me
some
strawberry
shortcake
and
she
was
off
like
a
breeze
and
out
of
sight
wait
a
minute
leslie
i
go
up
with
you
called
clive
with
his
mouth
full
of
shortcake
and
cream
but
leslie
was
already
whirling
down
the
street
like
the
wind
allison
had
taken
the
car
so
there
was
nothing
left
for
clive
to
do
but
finish
his
shortcake
and
think
up
some
form
of
amusement
with
the
freshman
vamp
for
the
afternoon
allison
meantime
had
made
a
straight
dash
for
the
college
and
sent
a
message
up
to
jane
that
he
must
see
her
at
once
on
very
important
business
after
what
seemed
to
him
an
endless
wait
word
came
down
that
jane
was
not
in
her
room
and
her
roommate
knew
nothing
of
her
whereabouts
allison
made
a
wild
dive
for
his
car
and
drove
to
every
one
of
the
places
where
jane
sometimes
went
to
help
out
with
the
children
when
their
mothers
were
particularly
busy
but
no
jane
materialized
he
drove
madly
back
to
the
college
forgetting
his
usual
cool
philosophy
of
life
and
fancying
all
sorts
of
terrible
things
that
might
have
happened
to
jane
he
swept
past
eugenia
frazer
without
even
seeing
her
and
brought
up
in
front
of
the
office
once
more
intending
to
send
up
and
see
if
jane
had
yet
returned
but
on
the
steps
stood
leslie
waiting
for
him
she
gone
to
the
woods
up
above
the
old
quarry
she
said
anxiously
i
just
found
out
benny
the
kitchen
boy
told
me
he
says
he
saw
her
go
out
between
chemistry
hall
and
the
boys
gym
about
an
hour
ago
she
must
have
gone
right
after
she
left
the
meeting
nobody
seems
to
have
seen
her
since
nobody
but
benny
knows
anything
about
her
going
to
the
woods
and
i
gave
him
some
money
and
told
him
not
to
say
anything
about
it
if
anyone
asked
i
was
just
going
to
hunt
her
that
all
right
kid
you
take
the
car
and
follow
up
the
road
go
through
the
woods
and
look
for
her
said
allison
springing
out
you
will
be
careful
wo
you
you
know
that
quarry
is
terribly
deep
i
said
allison
his
tone
showing
his
own
anxiety
and
jane
has
scrambled
around
here
as
much
as
we
have
she
has
had
the
time
and
there
is
so
much
undergrowth
close
up
to
the
edge
one
could
come
on
it
unaware
especially
if
one
was
excited
and
not
paying
attention
i
better
beat
it
jump
in
and
drive
me
around
college
and
i
get
off
at
the
gym
leslie
sprang
in
and
allison
stood
on
the
his
sister
cast
a
wistful
glance
at
him
as
she
started
the
car
allison
i
think
maybe
you
need
worry
she
said
softly
you
know
jane
is
real
she
is
weak
like
some
people
she
wo
go
all
to
pieces
like
well
like
i
would
god
means
something
to
her
you
know
i
know
said
allison
gravely
gently
thank
you
kid
well
i
get
off
here
meet
me
at
the
top
of
the
second
hill
in
half
an
hour
and
hang
around
there
for
a
bit
i
may
whistle
see
so
long
he
dashed
off
between
the
buildings
and
disappeared
between
the
trees
in
the
edge
of
the
woods
leslie
whirled
off
down
the
drive
to
the
street
as
she
passed
the
big
stone
gateway
ivy
garlanded
and
sweet
with
climbing
roses
three
seniors
turned
into
the
drive
and
the
foremost
of
the
three
was
howard
letchworth
her
heart
leaped
up
with
joy
that
here
was
someone
who
would
understand
and
sympathize
and
she
put
her
foot
to
the
brake
to
slow
down
with
a
light
of
welcome
in
her
eyes
but
before
she
could
stop
he
had
lifted
his
hat
and
passed
on
with
the
others
as
if
he
were
just
anyone
of
course
he
had
not
seen
her
intention
did
not
realize
that
she
wanted
to
speak
with
him
yet
it
hurt
her
a
week
or
two
before
she
would
have
called
after
him
or
even
backed
the
car
to
catch
him
but
now
something
froze
within
her
and
with
her
heart
beating
wildly
and
tears
scorching
her
eyes
she
put
on
speed
and
whirled
away
up
the
hill
it
seemed
to
her
that
all
her
lovely
world
was
breaking
into
pieces
under
her
feet
if
it
had
not
been
that
she
was
worried
about
jane
she
would
have
been
tempted
to
abandon
everything
and
rush
off
in
some
wild
way
by
herself
anywhere
to
be
alone
and
face
the
ache
in
her
heart
it
was
such
a
torrent
of
feelings
hurt
pride
and
anger
humiliation
and
pain
all
these
words
rushed
through
her
mind
but
there
was
something
else
besides
something
that
ought
to
have
been
beautiful
and
wonderful
and
was
only
shame
and
pain
and
she
had
not
yet
come
to
the
point
where
she
was
willing
to
call
that
something
by
name
she
knew
that
soon
she
must
face
the
truth
and
have
it
out
with
herself
and
so
her
cheeks
flamed
and
paled
and
the
tears
scorched
and
hurt
in
her
eyes
and
throat
and
she
tried
to
put
it
all
away
and
think
about
jane
poor
hurt
jane
jane
gone
into
the
woods
to
have
it
but
with
herself
but
jane
was
strong
and
jane
trusted
in
god
her
god
was
strong
too
jane
would
come
through
only
the
sweeter
but
what
would
become
of
her
little
fiery
tempestuous
leslie
who
always
did
the
wrong
thing
first
and
was
sorry
afterwards
and
who
forgot
god
when
she
needed
him
most
these
thoughts
flitted
like
visions
through
her
brain
while
she
put
on
all
speed
and
tore
away
up
the
hill
at
a
much
faster
rate
than
she
had
any
business
to
do
but
the
road
was
clear
ahead
of
her
and
there
was
some
relief
in
flying
along
through
space
this
way
it
seemed
to
clear
the
mists
from
her
brain
and
cool
down
her
throbbing
pulses
yet
just
when
she
would
think
she
had
control
of
her
thoughts
that
stern
distant
expression
on
howard
face
would
come
between
her
and
the
afternoon
brightness
and
back
would
roll
the
trouble
with
renewed
vigor
what
a
world
this
was
anyway
and
why
did
people
have
to
live
just
trouble
trouble
trouble
everywhere
and
who
would
have
thought
there
would
come
trouble
between
her
and
howard
such
good
friends
as
they
had
been
now
almost
two
years
two
wonderful
years
and
again
her
weary
brain
would
beat
over
the
question
what
had
been
the
matter
what
made
howard
act
that
way
surely
nothing
she
could
have
done
chapter
xxix
meantime
allison
was
dashing
over
fallen
trees
climbing
rocks
and
pushing
his
way
between
tangled
vines
and
laurel
up
and
up
through
the
college
woods
and
across
country
in
the
direction
of
the
quarry
a
still
wonderful
place
like
a
cathedral
with
a
deep
dark
pool
at
the
bottom
of
the
massive
stone
walls
there
were
pines
hemlocks
and
oaks
for
vaulted
roof
with
the
fresco
of
sky
and
flying
cloud
between
it
was
a
wonderful
place
once
when
they
had
climbed
there
together
and
stood
for
a
long
time
in
silence
watching
the
shadows
on
the
deep
pool
below
looking
up
to
the
arching
green
and
listening
to
the
praisings
of
a
song
sparrow
up
above
in
some
hidden
choir
jane
had
said
that
this
was
a
place
to
come
and
worship
or
to
come
when
one
was
in
trouble
a
place
where
one
might
meet
god
he
had
looked
down
at
her
sweet
face
upturned
searching
for
the
little
thrilling
singer
and
had
thought
how
sweet
and
wonderful
she
was
and
how
he
wanted
to
tell
her
so
and
would
some
day
but
must
not
just
yet
he
had
thought
much
about
what
she
was
saying
but
now
it
came
back
and
he
knew
that
she
must
have
gone
here
with
her
trouble
he
need
not
have
worried
about
the
quarry
and
the
deep
dark
pool
he
kept
telling
himself
all
the
way
up
that
he
need
not
but
when
he
reached
the
top
and
came
in
sight
of
her
he
knew
it
knew
also
that
he
had
been
of
it
all
along
she
was
sitting
on
a
great
fallen
log
quietly
calmly
with
her
back
against
an
old
gnarled
branch
that
rose
in
a
convenient
way
and
her
head
was
thrown
back
and
up
as
if
she
were
seeing
wonderful
visions
somewhere
among
the
green
and
the
blue
and
white
above
it
was
as
if
she
had
reached
a
higher
plane
where
earthly
annoyances
do
not
come
and
felt
it
good
to
be
there
there
was
almost
a
smile
on
her
beautiful
lips
a
strong
sweet
wistful
smile
she
had
not
been
looking
down
at
the
deep
treacherous
pool
at
all
she
had
been
looking
and
her
strength
had
come
upon
her
so
for
one
long
instant
the
young
man
paused
and
lifted
his
hat
watching
her
in
a
kind
of
awe
her
face
almost
seemed
to
shine
as
if
she
had
been
talking
with
god
he
remembered
dimly
the
story
of
moses
on
the
mount
talking
with
god
he
hesitated
almost
to
intrude
upon
a
solitude
so
fine
and
wonderful
then
in
relief
and
eagerness
he
spoke
her
name
jane
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
and
her
face
lit
up
with
joy
oh
it
is
you
why
how
did
you
happen
i
came
to
find
you
jane
leslie
told
me
everything
and
i
have
hunted
everywhere
but
when
you
were
not
at
college
i
somehow
knew
you
would
be
here
i
wanted
to
find
you
and
enfold
you
jane
wrap
you
around
somehow
with
my
love
and
care
if
you
will
let
me
so
that
nothing
like
that
can
ever
hurt
you
again
i
love
you
jane
i
suppose
i
a
little
previous
and
all
that
being
only
a
kid
as
it
were
and
neither
of
us
out
of
college
yet
but
i
sha
change
and
i
be
hanged
if
i
see
why
it
is
all
right
for
me
to
have
the
right
to
protect
you
against
such
annoyances
as
this
he
was
beside
her
on
the
log
now
his
face
burning
eagerly
with
deep
feeling
one
arm
protectingly
behind
her
the
other
hand
laid
strongly
possessively
over
the
small
folded
hands
in
her
lap
perhaps
i
taking
a
whole
lot
for
granted
he
said
humbly
perhaps
you
do
love
me
ca
even
like
me
the
way
i
hoped
you
do
oh
jane
speak
quick
and
tell
me
darling
can
you
ever
love
me
enough
you
have
drawn
your
hands
away
look
up
and
let
me
read
your
eyes
please
no
she
had
not
drawn
her
hands
away
and
she
did
not
shrink
from
his
supporting
arm
and
she
was
the
kind
of
girl
who
would
not
have
allowed
such
familiarities
she
had
lifted
her
eyes
and
there
was
something
blindingly
beautiful
in
them
and
tears
great
wonderful
tears
so
sweet
and
misty
that
they
made
him
glad
with
a
thrill
of
beautiful
pain
her
lips
were
trembling
he
longed
to
kiss
her
yet
knew
he
must
wait
until
he
had
her
permission
allison
listen
you
are
dear
but
you
do
know
a
thing
about
me
i
know
all
i
want
to
know
and
that
is
a
great
deal
you
darling
you
and
now
he
did
kiss
her
and
drew
her
close
into
his
arms
and
would
not
let
her
go
even
when
she
struggled
gently
allison
listen
please
i
must
tell
you
she
put
her
hands
against
his
breast
and
pushed
herself
back
away
from
him
where
she
could
look
in
his
face
please
you
let
me
go
and
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
i
let
you
go
when
you
tell
me
yes
or
no
jane
do
you
can
you
love
me
i
must
know
that
first
then
you
shall
have
your
way
jane
eyes
did
not
falter
she
looked
at
him
you
promised
you
know
yes
allison
i
love
you
but
you
must
kiss
me
again
you
must
let
me
go
and
listen
you
promised
you
know
allison
arms
dropped
away
from
her
but
his
eyes
held
her
in
a
long
look
of
joy
all
right
darling
go
to
it
he
said
with
a
joyous
sound
in
his
voice
i
can
stand
anything
now
i
know
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
and
it
enough
for
me
but
hurry
a
fellow
ca
wait
forever
no
allison
you
must
sit
back
and
be
serious
it
is
really
you
know
what
i
have
to
tell
you
allison
became
grave
at
once
all
right
jane
only
i
ca
imagine
anything
terrible
enough
to
stop
this
happiness
of
mine
unless
you
already
married
and
have
been
concealing
it
from
us
all
this
time
in
spite
of
herself
jane
laughed
at
that
and
allison
breathed
more
freely
now
the
tenseness
was
gone
out
of
her
voice
his
hands
went
out
and
grasped
hers
at
least
i
can
do
this
he
pleaded
and
jane
lifted
her
eyes
now
serious
again
and
smiled
tenderly
letting
her
hands
stay
in
his
passively
listen
allison
my
father
i
know
jane
dear
i
heard
it
long
ago
your
father
was
a
forger
what
do
you
suppose
i
care
he
probably
had
some
overpowering
temptation
and
yielded
never
dreaming
but
he
would
be
able
to
make
it
right
you
ca
make
me
believe
that
any
parent
of
was
actually
bad
and
besides
if
he
was
it
would
be
allison
listen
broke
in
jane
gravely
stopping
the
torrent
of
words
with
which
he
was
attempting
to
silence
her
it
is
what
you
think
at
all
my
father
a
forger
he
was
a
good
man
he
was
exclaimed
allison
joyously
then
what
in
thunder
why
did
you
tell
so
jane
he
tried
to
draw
her
to
him
but
she
still
resisted
that
just
it
allison
i
ca
i
can
well
then
will
you
sha
have
a
thing
like
that
hanging
over
you
but
that
is
just
what
you
not
and
you
do
it
either
if
i
do
tell
you
about
it
for
you
would
have
a
thing
to
say
nor
any
way
to
prove
it
and
i
wo
tell
you
allison
ever
unless
you
will
promise
allison
was
sobered
in
an
instant
jane
do
you
know
me
well
enough
to
be
sure
i
would
not
betray
any
confidence
you
put
in
me
i
thought
so
said
jane
smiling
through
her
tears
dear
said
allison
in
a
tone
that
was
a
caress
full
of
longing
and
sympathy
jane
sat
up
bravely
and
began
her
story
when
i
was
twelve
years
old
my
mother
died
that
left
father
and
me
alone
and
we
became
very
close
comrades
indeed
he
was
a
wonderful
father
allison
fingers
answered
with
a
warm
pressure
of
sympathy
and
interest
he
was
father
and
mother
both
to
me
and
more
and
more
we
grew
to
confide
in
one
another
i
was
interested
in
all
his
business
and
used
to
amuse
myself
asking
him
about
things
at
the
office
when
he
came
home
the
way
mother
used
to
do
when
she
was
with
us
he
used
to
talk
over
all
my
school
friends
and
interests
and
we
had
beautiful
times
together
my
father
had
a
friend
a
man
who
had
grown
up
with
him
lived
next
door
and
went
to
school
with
him
when
he
was
a
boy
he
was
younger
than
father
and
well
not
so
serious
father
did
always
approve
of
what
he
did
and
used
to
urge
him
to
do
differently
he
lived
in
the
same
suburb
with
us
and
his
wife
had
been
a
friend
of
mother
she
was
a
sweet
little
woman
very
pretty
and
an
invalid
they
had
one
daughter
a
girl
about
my
age
and
when
we
were
children
we
used
to
play
together
but
as
we
grew
older
mother
care
for
us
to
be
together
much
she
thought
it
was
better
for
us
not
to
and
as
the
years
went
by
we
did
have
much
to
do
with
one
another
her
father
was
the
only
one
who
kept
up
the
acquaintance
and
sometimes
i
used
to
think
he
worried
my
father
every
time
he
came
to
the
house
one
day
when
i
was
about
fourteen
he
came
in
the
afternoon
just
after
i
got
home
from
school
and
said
he
wanted
to
see
father
as
soon
as
he
came
home
could
i
telephone
father
and
ask
him
to
come
home
at
once
that
there
was
someone
there
wanting
to
see
him
on
important
business
he
finally
called
him
up
himself
and
when
father
got
there
they
went
into
a
room
by
themselves
and
talked
until
late
into
the
night
when
at
last
that
is
the
went
away
father
did
not
go
to
bed
but
walked
up
and
down
the
floor
in
his
study
all
night
long
toward
morning
i
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
i
knew
my
father
was
in
trouble
so
i
went
down
to
him
and
when
i
saw
him
i
was
terribly
frightened
his
face
was
white
and
drawn
and
his
eyes
burned
like
coals
of
fire
he
looked
at
me
with
a
look
that
i
never
shall
forget
he
took
me
in
his
arms
and
lifted
up
my
face
a
way
he
often
had
when
he
was
in
earnest
and
he
seemed
to
be
looking
down
into
my
very
soul
girl
he
said
in
deep
trouble
i
do
know
whether
i
done
right
or
not
there
was
something
in
his
voice
that
made
me
tremble
all
over
and
he
saw
i
was
frightened
and
tried
to
be
calm
himself
he
said
he
always
called
me
janie
when
he
was
deeply
moved
it
may
hit
hardest
on
you
and
oh
i
meant
your
life
to
be
so
safe
and
happy
i
tried
to
tell
him
it
did
matter
about
me
and
for
him
not
to
be
troubled
but
he
went
on
telling
about
it
it
seems
the
father
of
this
man
had
once
done
a
great
deal
for
my
father
when
he
was
in
a
very
trying
situation
and
father
always
felt
an
obligation
to
look
after
the
son
indeed
he
had
promised
when
the
old
man
was
dying
that
he
would
be
a
brother
to
him
no
matter
what
happened
and
now
the
son
had
been
speculating
and
got
deep
into
debt
he
had
formed
some
kind
of
stock
company
something
to
do
with
western
land
and
mines
i
never
fully
understood
it
all
but
there
had
been
a
lot
of
fraudulent
dealing
although
father
only
suspected
that
at
the
time
but
anyway
everything
was
going
to
fall
through
and
the
man
was
going
to
be
brought
up
in
disgrace
before
the
world
if
somebody
did
help
him
out
and
father
felt
obliged
to
stand
by
him
of
course
he
did
not
know
how
bad
it
was
because
the
man
had
not
told
him
all
the
truth
but
father
had
taken
over
the
obligations
of
the
whole
thing
he
thought
he
might
be
able
to
pull
the
thing
out
of
trouble
by
putting
a
good
deal
of
his
own
money
into
it
and
make
it
a
fair
and
square
proposition
for
all
the
stockholders
without
their
ever
finding
out
that
everything
had
been
on
the
verge
of
going
to
pieces
you
see
the
man
had
put
it
up
to
father
very
eloquently
that
his
wife
was
very
ill
in
the
hospital
and
if
anything
should
happen
to
him
and
he
were
arrested
it
could
not
be
kept
from
her
and
she
would
die
it
true
she
was
very
critically
ill
had
just
been
through
a
severe
operation
and
was
very
frail
indeed
father
felt
it
was
up
to
him
to
shoulder
the
whole
responsibility
although
of
course
he
felt
that
the
man
richly
deserved
the
law
to
the
full
nevertheless
because
of
his
promise
he
stood
by
him
that
night
the
man
was
killed
in
an
automobile
accident
soon
after
leaving
our
house
and
when
it
developed
that
the
business
was
built
on
a
rotten
foundation
and
that
father
was
in
partnership
you
see
the
man
had
been
very
wily
and
had
his
papers
all
fixed
up
so
that
it
looked
as
if
father
had
been
a
silent
partner
from
the
beginning
everything
came
back
on
father
and
he
found
there
were
overwhelming
debts
that
he
had
not
been
told
about
although
he
supposed
he
had
sifted
the
business
to
the
foundation
and
understood
it
all
before
he
made
the
agreement
to
help
him
perhaps
if
the
man
had
lived
he
would
have
been
able
to
carry
his
crooked
dealings
through
and
save
the
whole
thing
with
what
help
father
had
given
him
and
neither
father
nor
the
world
would
ever
have
found
out
i
do
but
anyway
his
dying
just
then
made
the
whole
thing
fall
in
ruins
and
right
on
top
of
father
but
even
that
we
could
have
stood
we
did
care
so
much
about
money
father
was
well
off
and
he
found
that
if
he
put
in
everything
he
could
satisfy
the
creditors
and
pay
off
everything
and
he
had
courage
enough
to
be
planning
to
start
all
over
again
but
suddenly
it
turned
out
that
there
had
been
a
check
forged
for
a
large
amount
and
it
all
looked
as
if
father
had
done
it
i
ca
go
into
the
details
now
but
we
were
suddenly
face
to
face
with
the
fact
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
prove
that
he
had
not
been
a
hypocrite
all
these
years
except
his
own
life
we
thought
for
a
few
days
that
of
course
that
would
put
him
beyond
suspicion
but
do
you
know
the
world
is
very
hard
one
of
father
best
friends
one
he
thought
was
a
friend
came
to
him
and
offered
to
go
bail
for
him
for
my
sake
if
he
would
just
tell
him
the
whole
truth
and
own
up
there
was
only
one
way
and
that
was
to
go
to
the
man
wife
and
try
to
get
certain
papers
which
father
knew
were
in
existence
because
he
had
seen
them
and
which
he
had
supposed
were
left
in
his
own
safe
the
night
the
man
talked
with
him
but
which
could
not
be
found
as
the
wife
had
just
been
brought
back
from
the
hospital
and
was
still
in
a
very
critical
condition
father
would
not
do
more
than
ask
if
he
might
go
through
the
house
and
search
and
that
woman
sent
back
a
very
indignant
refusal
charging
father
with
having
been
at
the
bottom
of
her
failure
and
even
the
cause
of
his
death
and
telling
him
he
had
pauperized
her
and
her
little
helpless
daughter
and
the
daughter
began
treating
me
as
a
stranger
whenever
we
chanced
to
meet
allison
face
darkened
and
his
eyes
looked
stern
and
hard
he
said
something
under
his
breath
angrily
jane
could
catch
the
words
but
he
drew
her
close
in
his
arms
and
held
her
tenderly
and
were
those
papers
never
found
dear
he
asked
after
a
moment
yes
said
jane
wearily
resting
her
head
back
against
his
shoulder
i
found
them
after
father
died
you
found
them
yes
i
found
them
slipped
down
behind
the
chest
in
the
hall
it
was
a
heavy
oak
chest
a
great
carved
affair
that
had
belonged
in
the
family
a
long
time
and
it
was
seldom
moved
it
stood
below
the
in
the
alcove
in
the
hall
and
i
figured
it
out
that
the
man
must
have
meant
to
keep
those
papers
himself
so
there
would
be
no
incriminating
evidence
in
father
hands
and
that
he
must
have
picked
them
up
without
father
noticing
and
started
to
carry
them
home
but
that
when
he
was
going
away
putting
on
his
overcoat
he
had
somehow
dropped
some
of
them
behind
that
chest
without
knowing
it
because
they
were
not
all
there
two
of
them
were
missing
father
had
described
them
to
me
and
three
the
most
important
ones
with
the
empty
envelope
were
found
the
other
two
were
probably
larger
and
looked
like
the
whole
bundle
which
explains
how
he
came
to
think
he
had
them
all
but
the
two
he
had
and
must
have
had
about
him
when
he
was
killed
would
not
in
themselves
have
been
any
evidence
against
him
so
my
father
was
arrested
the
tears
choked
jane
voice
and
suddenly
rained
into
her
sweet
eyes
as
she
struggled
to
recall
the
whole
sorrowful
experience
oh
my
darling
cried
allison
tenderly
holding
her
close
father
was
very
brave
he
said
it
was
sure
to
come
out
all
right
but
he
would
accept
bail
though
it
was
offered
him
by
several
loyal
friends
he
saw
that
they
suspected
him
and
the
papers
all
came
out
with
big
headlines
elder
arrested
allison
voice
was
deep
with
loving
sympathy
as
his
lips
swept
her
forehead
softly
and
he
murmured
my
poor
little
girl
but
jane
went
bravely
on
that
was
a
hard
time
she
said
with
trembling
lips
but
god
was
good
he
did
let
it
last
long
there
came
an
old
friend
back
from
abroad
who
had
known
father
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
and
who
happened
to
have
been
associated
with
him
in
business
long
enough
to
give
certain
proofs
that
cleared
the
whole
thing
up
in
a
week
the
case
was
dismissed
so
far
as
father
was
concerned
and
he
was
back
at
home
again
and
restored
to
the
full
confidence
of
his
business
associates
that
is
those
who
knew
intimately
about
the
matter
if
father
had
lived
i
have
no
doubt
everything
would
have
been
all
right
and
he
would
have
been
able
to
live
down
the
whole
thing
but
the
trouble
had
struck
him
hard
he
was
so
terribly
worried
for
my
sake
you
know
then
he
took
a
little
cold
which
we
did
think
anything
about
and
suddenly
before
we
realized
it
he
was
down
with
double
pneumonia
from
which
he
never
rallied
his
vitality
seemed
to
be
gone
after
he
died
the
papers
said
beautiful
things
about
his
bravery
and
courage
and
christianity
and
people
tried
to
be
nice
but
when
it
was
all
over
there
were
still
people
who
looked
at
me
curiously
when
i
passed
and
whispered
noticeably
together
and
that
man
wife
and
daughter
openly
called
me
a
forger
daughter
and
said
that
my
father
had
stolen
their
income
when
all
the
time
they
were
living
on
what
he
had
given
up
to
save
them
from
disgrace
the
daughter
made
it
so
unpleasant
for
me
that
i
decided
to
go
away
where
i
was
not
known
although
i
had
several
dear
beautiful
homes
opened
to
me
if
i
had
chosen
to
stay
where
i
might
have
been
a
daughter
and
treated
as
one
of
the
other
children
but
i
thought
it
was
better
to
go
away
and
make
my
own
life
but
you
had
evidence
did
you
never
go
and
tell
those
two
how
wrong
they
were
and
how
it
was
their
father
not
yours
who
was
the
forger
no
not
exactly
said
jane
lifting
clear
untroubled
eyes
to
his
face
you
see
that
was
part
of
father
obligation
it
was
a
point
of
honor
not
to
give
that
man
shame
away
to
his
wife
he
had
promised
and
then
the
man
was
dead
he
could
not
be
brought
to
justice
what
good
would
it
do
it
would
have
done
the
good
that
those
two
women
would
have
gone
around
snubbing
you
and
telling
lies
about
you
oh
well
after
all
that
did
really
hurt
me
and
that
brazen
girl
would
have
dared
come
here
to
the
same
college
and
make
it
hot
for
you
allison
how
did
you
jane
sat
up
and
looked
into
his
eyes
startled
i
knew
from
the
first
mention
that
it
must
have
been
eugenia
frazer
no
girl
in
her
senses
would
have
taken
the
trouble
to
do
what
she
did
without
some
grievance
oh
that
girl
she
is
beyond
words
think
of
anybody
ever
falling
in
love
with
her
i
like
the
pleasure
of
informing
her
what
her
father
was
of
course
though
it
was
her
fault
she
could
help
her
father
being
what
he
was
but
she
could
help
what
she
is
herself
i
should
certainly
like
to
see
her
get
what
coming
to
her
do
allison
please
it
is
the
right
spirit
for
us
to
have
perhaps
i
be
just
like
her
if
i
were
in
her
place
i
see
you
being
like
her
you
angel
and
allison
leaned
over
again
to
look
into
the
eyes
of
his
beloved
well
dear
we
get
the
right
spirit
about
it
somehow
and
forget
her
but
i
mean
she
shall
understand
right
where
she
gets
off
before
this
thing
goes
any
farther
no
you
need
protest
i
not
going
to
give
away
your
confidence
but
i
going
to
settle
that
girl
where
she
wo
dare
to
make
any
more
trouble
for
you
ever
again
and
the
first
thing
we
going
to
do
is
to
announce
our
engagement
i
feel
like
going
up
to
the
college
bulletin
board
right
this
minute
and
writing
it
out
in
great
big
letters
allison
jane
sat
up
with
shining
eyes
and
her
cheeks
very
red
then
they
both
broke
down
and
laughed
jane
merriment
ending
in
a
serious
look
allison
you
really
now
you
know
what
people
may
think
about
my
father
jane
i
known
all
that
since
i
first
saw
you
our
beloved
pastor
kindly
informed
me
of
it
the
night
he
introduced
us
so
you
see
how
little
weight
it
had
with
any
of
us
i
had
no
knowledge
but
that
it
was
all
true
although
i
could
for
the
life
of
me
see
how
a
man
who
was
unworthy
of
you
could
have
possibly
been
your
father
but
it
was
you
and
not
your
father
i
fell
in
love
with
the
first
night
i
saw
you
i
mighty
glad
for
your
sake
that
he
was
that
kind
of
man
because
i
know
how
you
would
feel
about
it
but
as
for
what
other
people
think
about
it
should
and
jane
make
up
your
mind
right
here
and
now
that
we
going
to
be
married
the
day
we
both
graduate
see
i
wo
wait
a
day
longer
to
have
the
right
to
protect
you
the
tall
trees
whispered
above
their
heads
and
the
birds
looked
down
and
dropped
wonderful
melodies
about
them
and
leslie
stormily
drove
her
car
back
and
forth
on
the
pike
and
sounded
her
klaxon
loud
and
long
but
it
was
almost
an
hour
later
that
it
suddenly
occurred
to
allison
that
leslie
was
waiting
for
them
and
still
later
before
the
two
with
blissful
lingering
finally
wended
their
way
out
to
the
road
and
were
taken
up
by
the
subdued
and
weary
leslie
who
greeted
them
with
relief
and
fell
upon
her
new
sister
with
eager
enthusiasm
and
genuine
delight
an
hour
later
allison
after
committing
his
future
bride
to
the
tender
ministries
of
julia
cloud
who
had
received
her
as
a
daughter
took
his
way
collegeward
he
sent
up
his
card
to
miss
frazer
and
miss
brice
and
requested
that
he
might
see
them
both
as
soon
as
possible
and
in
a
flutter
of
expectancy
the
two
presently
entered
the
they
were
hoping
he
had
come
to
take
them
out
in
his
car
although
each
was
disappointed
to
find
that
she
was
not
the
only
one
summoned
allison
in
that
few
minutes
of
waiting
for
them
seemed
to
have
lost
his
boyish
air
and
have
grown
to
man
estate
he
greeted
the
two
young
women
with
utmost
courtesy
and
gravity
and
proceeded
at
once
to
business
i
have
come
to
inform
you
he
said
with
a
bow
that
might
almost
be
called
stately
so
much
had
the
tall
slender
figure
lost
its
boyishness
that
miss
bristol
is
my
fiancée
and
as
such
it
is
my
business
to
protect
her
i
must
ask
you
both
to
publicly
apologize
before
your
sorority
for
what
happened
this
morning
eunice
brice
grew
white
and
frightened
but
eugenia
frazer
face
flamed
angrily
indeed
allison
cloud
i
do
nothing
of
the
kind
what
in
the
world
did
you
suppose
i
had
to
do
with
what
happened
this
morning
you
had
all
to
do
with
it
miss
frazer
i
happen
to
know
all
about
the
matter
well
you
certainly
do
flamed
eugenia
or
you
would
be
engaged
to
that
little
bristol
hypocrite
her
father
was
a
common
allison
took
a
step
toward
her
his
face
stern
but
controlled
her
father
was
a
miss
frazer
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
you
know
that
the
report
you
are
spreading
about
college
is
not
true
but
however
that
may
be
miss
frazer
if
i
should
say
that
your
father
was
a
forger
would
that
change
any
i
have
asked
miss
bristol
to
marry
me
because
of
what
is
and
not
because
of
what
her
father
was
but
there
is
ample
evidence
that
her
father
was
a
noble
and
an
upright
man
and
so
recognized
by
the
law
and
by
his
and
i
demand
that
you
take
back
your
words
publicly
both
of
you
and
that
you
miss
frazer
take
upon
yourself
publicly
the
responsibility
for
starting
this
whole
trouble
i
fancy
it
may
be
rather
unpleasant
for
you
to
remain
in
this
college
longer
unless
this
matter
is
adjusted
satisfactorily
well
i
certainly
do
not
intend
to
be
bullied
into
any
such
thing
said
eugenia
angrily
i
leave
college
first
eunice
brice
began
to
cry
she
was
the
protégée
of
a
rich
woman
and
could
not
afford
to
be
disgraced
i
shall
tell
them
all
that
you
asked
me
to
make
that
motion
for
you
and
promised
to
give
me
your
pink
evening
dress
if
i
did
reproached
eunice
tearfully
tell
what
you
like
returned
eugenia
grandly
it
will
only
prove
you
what
you
are
a
little
fool
i
going
up
to
pack
you
think
you
can
hush
me
up
allison
cloud
if
you
rich
money
wo
cover
up
the
truth
no
said
allison
looking
at
her
steadily
controlledly
with
a
memory
of
his
promise
to
jane
no
but
will
sometimes
oh
yes
everybody
knows
you
a
fanatic
sneered
eugenia
and
swept
herself
out
of
the
room
with
high
head
knowing
that
the
wisest
thing
she
could
do
was
to
depart
while
the
going
was
good
when
allison
reached
home
a
few
minutes
later
julia
cloud
put
into
his
hand
a
letter
which
his
guardian
had
written
her
soon
after
his
first
visit
in
which
he
stated
that
he
had
made
it
a
point
to
look
up
both
the
young
people
with
whom
his
wards
were
intimate
and
he
found
their
records
and
their
family
irreproachable
he
especially
went
into
details
concerning
jane
father
and
the
noble
way
in
which
he
had
acted
and
the
completeness
with
which
his
name
had
been
cleared
he
uncovered
one
or
two
facts
which
jane
apparently
did
not
know
and
which
proved
that
time
had
revealed
the
true
criminal
to
those
most
concerned
and
that
only
pity
for
his
family
and
the
expressed
wish
of
the
man
who
had
borne
for
a
time
his
shame
had
caused
the
matter
to
be
hushed
up
allison
after
he
had
read
it
went
to
find
jane
and
drew
her
into
the
little
to
read
it
with
him
and
together
they
rejoiced
quietly
jane
lifted
a
shining
face
to
allison
after
the
reading
then
i
glad
we
never
said
anything
to
eugenia
poor
eugenia
she
is
greatly
to
be
pitied
allison
a
little
shamefacedly
agreed
and
then
owned
up
that
he
had
fired
eugenia
as
he
expressed
it
from
the
college
o
allison
said
jane
half
troubled
though
laughing
in
spite
of
herself
at
the
vision
of
eugenia
trying
to
be
lofty
in
the
face
of
the
facts
you
ought
not
to
have
done
it
dear
i
have
stood
it
so
long
it
did
matter
only
for
your
sake
and
leslie
for
our
sakes
nothing
said
allison
that
girl
needed
somebody
to
tell
her
where
to
get
off
and
only
a
man
could
do
it
she
be
more
polite
to
people
hereafter
i
thinking
it
wo
do
her
any
harm
now
jane
darling
forget
it
and
let
be
happy
be
careful
allison
some
one
is
coming
i
think
it
that
mr
terrence
his
fool
hide
muttered
allison
i
wish
he
take
himself
home
i
certainly
would
like
to
tell
where
to
get
off
as
sick
of
him
as
i
am
and
as
for
cloudy
she
about
reached
the
limit
why
allison
is
leslie
interested
in
him
he
told
howard
that
they
were
as
good
as
engaged
leslie
interested
in
that
little
cad
i
should
say
not
if
she
was
i
disown
her
you
say
he
told
howard
they
were
engaged
what
a
lie
so
that
what
the
matter
with
the
old
boy
is
it
i
thought
something
must
be
the
matter
that
he
got
so
busy
all
of
a
sudden
well
i
soon
fix
that
come
on
up
to
cloudy
porch
quick
while
he
in
his
room
cloudy
wo
mind
we
be
by
ourselves
there
till
dinner
is
ready
chapter
xxx
but
matters
came
to
a
climax
with
howard
letchworth
before
allison
had
any
opportunity
to
do
any
fixing
the
next
afternoon
was
class
day
and
there
were
big
doings
at
the
college
howard
kept
out
of
the
way
for
it
was
a
day
on
which
he
had
counted
much
and
during
the
winter
once
or
twice
he
and
leslie
had
talked
of
it
as
a
matter
of
course
that
they
would
be
around
together
his
class
day
had
seemed
then
to
be
of
so
much
importance
to
her
and
now
now
she
was
going
to
attend
it
in
clive
terrence
company
terrence
had
told
him
so
and
there
seemed
no
reason
to
doubt
his
word
she
went
everywhere
with
him
and
he
was
their
guest
why
should
she
so
howard
went
glumly
about
his
duties
keeping
as
much
as
possible
out
of
everyone
way
if
he
had
not
been
a
part
of
the
order
of
exercises
and
a
moving
spirit
of
the
day
as
it
were
he
would
certainly
have
made
up
an
excuse
to
absent
himself
as
it
was
he
meditated
trying
to
get
some
one
else
to
take
his
place
and
was
on
his
way
to
arrange
it
just
before
the
hour
for
the
afternoon
exercises
to
begin
when
suddenly
he
saw
coming
up
the
wide
asphalt
walk
of
the
campus
young
terrence
and
the
girl
who
had
come
to
be
known
among
them
as
the
freshman
vamp
his
eyes
hastily
scanned
the
groups
about
and
searched
the
walk
as
far
as
he
could
see
it
but
nowhere
could
he
discover
leslie
with
a
sudden
impulse
he
dashed
over
to
julia
cloud
and
forgetful
of
his
late
estrangement
spoke
with
much
of
his
old
eagerness
albeit
trying
his
best
to
appear
careless
and
is
leslie
hereabouts
somewhere
miss
cloud
i
believe
i
promised
to
show
her
the
ivy
that
our
class
is
to
plant
it
was
the
first
excuse
he
could
think
of
but
julia
cloud
was
full
of
sympathy
and
understanding
and
only
too
glad
to
hear
the
old
ring
of
friendliness
in
his
voice
she
lowered
her
tone
and
spoke
confidentially
she
would
come
howard
i
do
just
know
what
has
taken
her
she
said
she
would
rather
stay
at
home
is
she
down
there
now
julia
cloud
nodded
perhaps
you
i
he
said
and
was
off
like
a
flash
on
his
way
down
the
campus
he
thrust
some
papers
into
a
classmate
hands
if
i
do
get
back
in
time
give
those
to
halsted
and
tell
him
to
look
out
for
things
i
called
away
never
in
all
his
running
days
had
he
run
as
he
did
that
day
he
made
the
station
in
four
minutes
where
it
usually
took
him
six
and
was
at
the
cloud
villa
in
two
more
all
out
of
breath
but
radiant
something
jubilant
had
been
let
loose
in
his
heart
by
the
smile
in
julia
eyes
utterly
unreasonable
of
course
but
still
it
had
come
and
he
was
entertaining
it
royally
it
was
rather
disheartening
to
find
the
front
door
locked
and
only
cherry
to
respond
to
his
knock
is
miss
leslie
here
he
asked
a
blank
look
coming
into
his
eyes
as
cherry
appeared
miss
leslie
done
jes
skittered
acrost
de
back
yahd
wid
a
paddle
in
her
han
i
reckum
she
gone
to

ef

finds
out

like
miss
leslie

down
to
them
canoes
all
by
her
lonesome
that
all
right
cherry
said
howard
cheering
up
i
go
down
and
find
her
got
an
extra
paddle
anywhere
or
did
she
take
them
both
no
sir
she
only
took
de
one
here
i
reckum
she
be
right
glad
to
see
yeh
howard
hes
missed
you
mighty
powerful
lot
that
there
little
wot
is
visitin
us
ai
no
kind
of
substoote
fer
you
howard
beamed
on
her
silently
and
was
off
like
a
shot
forgetful
of
the
chimes
on
the
clock
of
the
college
which
were
now
striking
the
hour
at
which
he
was
to
have
led
the
procession
down
the
ivy
walk
to
the
scene
of
festivities
over
two
fences
across
lots
down
a
steep
rocky
hill
and
he
was
at
the
little
landing
where
the
cloud
canoe
usually
anchored
but
leslie
and
her
boat
were
gone
no
glimpse
of
bright
hair
either
up
or
down
stream
gave
hint
of
which
she
had
taken
no
ripple
in
the
water
even
to
show
where
she
had
passed
but
he
knew
pretty
well
her
favorite
haunts
where
the
hemlocks
bowed
and
bent
to
the
water
and
made
dark
shadows
under
which
to
slip
the
silence
and
the
beauty
called
her
as
they
had
always
called
him
he
was
sure
he
would
find
her
there
rather
than
where
the
crowds
of
inn
people
played
around
and
the
tennis
courts
overflowed
into
canoes
and
dawdled
about
with
ukeleles
and
cameras
he
looked
about
for
a
means
of
transport
there
was
only
one
canoe
to
its
rest
he
examined
the
padlock
for
a
moment
then
put
forth
his
strong
young
arm
and
jerked
up
the
rest
from
its
firm
setting
in
the
earth
it
was
the
work
of
a
second
to
shoot
the
boat
into
the
water
fling
the
chains
and
all
into
the
bow
and
spring
after
long
strong
steady
strokes
and
he
shot
out
into
the
stream
and
away
up
beyond
the
willows
around
the
turn
where
the
chestnut
grove
bloomed
in
good
promise
for
the
autumn
beyond
the
railroad
bridge
and
the
rocks
past
the
first
dipping
hemlocks
around
the
curve
below
the
old
camp
where
they
had
had
so
many
delightful
picnics
and
watched
the
sunset
from
the
rocks
and
on
up
above
the
rapids
the
current
was
swift
he
wondered
if
leslie
had
been
able
to
pass
them
all
alone
yet
somehow
he
felt
she
had
and
he
would
find
her
up
in
the
quiet
haven
where
few
ever
came
and
where
she
would
be
undisturbed
paddling
indian
he
came
around
the
curve
silently
and
was
almost
upon
her
but
was
unprepared
for
the
little
huddled
figure
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
one
hand
grasping
the
paddle
which
was
wedged
between
some
stones
in
the
shallow
stream
bed
to
anchor
the
frail
bark
the
other
arm
curved
about
as
a
pillow
for
the
face
which
was
hidden
with
only
the
bright
hair
gleaming
in
the
stray
rays
of
sunshine
that
crept
through
the
young
leaves
overhead
leslie
little
girl
my
darling
what
is
the
matter
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
was
saying
so
anxiously
he
watched
her
was
she
hurt
or
in
trouble
and
if
so
what
was
the
trouble
did
the
vapid
little
guest
and
the
freshman
vamp
have
anything
to
do
with
it
somehow
he
forgot
all
about
himself
now
and
his
own
grievance
he
only
wanted
to
comfort
her
whom
he
loved
and
it
never
entered
his
head
that
just
at
that
moment
the
anxious
halsted
was
inquiring
of
everyone
have
you
seen
letchworth
class
day
be
a
mess
without
him
something
must
have
happened
to
him
leslie
lifted
a
face
in
startled
amaze
his
voice
those
precious
words
leslie
heard
them
even
if
took
no
cognizance
of
them
himself
i
you
well
you
ought
to
know
burst
forth
leslie
and
then
down
went
the
bright
head
once
more
and
the
slender
shoulders
shook
with
sobs
it
certainly
was
a
good
thing
that
the
creek
was
shallow
at
that
point
and
the
canoes
quite
used
to
all
sorts
of
conditions
howard
letchworth
waited
for
no
invitation
he
arose
and
stepped
into
leslie
boat
pinioned
his
own
with
a
dextrous
paddle
and
gave
attention
to
comforting
the
princess
it
somehow
needed
no
words
for
awhile
until
at
last
leslie
lifted
a
woebegone
face
that
already
looked
and
inquired
sobbily
what
made
you
act
so
perfectly
horrid
all
this
time
why
i
began
howard
lamely
wondering
now
just
why
he
why
you
see
leslie
you
had
company
and
company
now
howard
you
were
jealous
of
that
little
excuse
for
a
man
were
you
howard
colored
guiltily
why
you
see
leslie
you
are
so
far
above
me
oh
i
was
was
i
well
if
i
was
above
where
did
you
think
that
other
ridiculous
little
simp
belonged
i
should
like
to
know
with
i
hope
but
you
see
leslie
somehow
the
great
question
that
had
loomed
between
them
these
weeks
dwarfed
and
shrivelled
when
he
tried
to
explain
it
to
leslie
well
well
i
just
found
out
you
are
very
rich
well
well
poor
but
i
thought
you
just
said
you
me
flashed
leslie
indignantly
if
you
do
i
do
see
what
rich
and
poor
matter
all
belong
to
us
both
wo
it
i
should
not
said
the
young
man
drawing
himself
up
as
much
as
was
consistent
with
life
in
a
canoe
i
would
let
my
wife
support
me
well
perhaps
you
might
be
able
to
make
enough
to
twinkled
leslie
with
mischief
in
a
dimple
near
her
mouth
leslie
now
you
making
fun
i
mean
this
well
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
about
it
give
away
my
money
of
course
not
i
was
a
cad
and
all
that
but
somehow
it
seemed
as
though
i
had
any
business
to
be
coming
around
you
when
you
were
so
young
and
with
plenty
of
chances
of
men
worth
more
than
i
more
what
more
money
leslie
this
is
a
serious
matter
with
me
well
it
is
with
me
too
said
leslie
suddenly
grave
you
certainly
have
made
me
most
unhappy
for
about
three
weeks
but
beginning
to
think
you
do
love
me
after
all
what
is
money
between
people
who
love
each
other
only
something
that
they
can
have
a
good
time
spending
for
others
is
it
and
suppose
should
say
i
would
let
support
i
guess
after
all
if
you
think
so
much
of
money
you
do
really
care
leslie
their
eyes
met
and
his
suddenly
fell
before
her
steady
beautiful
gaze
well
then
howard
letchworth
if
you
are
so
awfully
proud
that
you
have
to
be
the
richest
i
throw
away
or
give
away
all
my
money
and
be
a
pauper
then
will
you
be
satisfied
what
money
without
the
one
you
love
anyway
i
see
leslie
i
was
a
fool
you
darling
wonderful
princess
no
keep
your
money
and
i
try
to
make
some
more
and
we
have
a
wonderful
time
helping
others
with
it
i
suppose
i
knew
i
was
a
fool
all
the
time
only
i
wanted
to
be
told
so
because
you
see
that
fellow
told
me
you
and
he
had
been
set
apart
for
each
other
by
your
parents
a
sudden
lurch
of
the
canoe
roused
him
to
look
at
leslie
face
oh
that
little
liar
yes
he
is
he
is
the
meanest
conceitedest
most
disagreeable
little
snob
there
there
we
spare
him
laughed
howard
i
see
i
was
wrong
again
only
leslie
little
princess
there
one
thing
you
must
own
is
true
you
very
young
yet
and
you
may
change
now
like
cried
leslie
you
do
even
think
i
have
the
stability
to
be
true
to
you
well
if
i
as
as
that
you
better
go
and
find
someone
else
but
he
stopped
her
words
with
his
face
against
her
lips
and
his
arms
about
her
and
at
last
she
nestled
against
his
shoulder
and
was
at
peace
chiming
out
above
the
notes
of
the
and
the
thrush
there
came
the
faint
and
distant
notes
of
the
quarter
hour
striking
on
the
college
library
it
was
leslie
who
heard
it
howard
was
still
too
far
upon
the
heights
to
think
of
earthly
duties
yet
awhile
howard
is
this
your
class
day
and
have
you
a
part
in
the
exercises
why
are
you
there
he
turned
with
startled
eyes
and
rising
color
i
could
stay
leslie
i
was
too
miserable
i
had
to
come
after
you
you
promised
to
be
with
me
you
know
but
your
class
poem
howard
quick
it
must
be
almost
time
to
read
it
he
took
out
his
watch
great
scott
i
did
know
the
time
had
gone
like
that
leslie
fingers
were
already
at
work
with
the
other
canoe
tying
its
chain
to
the
seat
of
her
own
now
she
turned
and
picked
up
her
paddle
swiftly
handing
howard
the
other
one
go
for
all
your
worth
you
must
fail
on
this
day
anyway
beat
it
with
all
your
might
it
too
late
said
the
man
reluctantly
taking
the
paddle
and
moving
to
his
right
position
it
not
too
late
it
be
too
late
i
say
one
and
two
and
and
they
settled
to
a
rhythmic
stroke
it
was
so
wonderful
back
there
leslie
said
howard
wistfully
we
ought
to
let
anything
interfere
with
this
first
hour
together
this
is
interfering
said
leslie
practically
it
just
duty
and
that
never
interferes
here
we
land
over
there
and
you
beat
it
up
the
hill
i
padlock
the
boats
by
that
old
tree
and
follow
but
you
wait
for
me
i
be
there
to
hear
the
first
word
and
they
have
waited
for
you
i
know
a
little
to
the
right
there
step
out
and
he
obeyed
her
and
presently
came
panting
to
the
audience
room
with
a
fine
color
and
a
great
light
in
his
eyes
just
as
halsted
was
slipping
down
to
inquire
of
allison
where
in
thunder
is
letchworth
seen
him
anywhere
heavens
man
has
he
showed
up
yet
cried
allison
startled
where
could
he
be
julia
cloud
beside
him
leaned
over
and
quietly
drew
their
attention
to
the
figure
hastening
up
the
aisle
halsted
hurried
back
to
the
platform
and
allison
relieved
settled
once
more
in
his
seat
but
julia
cloud
rested
not
in
satisfaction
until
another
figure
breathlessly
slipped
in
with
eyes
for
none
but
the
speaker
then
into
the
eyes
of
julia
cloud
there
came
a
vision
as
comes
to
one
who
watching
the
glorious
setting
of
the
sun
sees
not
the
regretful
close
of
the
day
that
is
past
but
the
golden
promise
of
the
day
that
is
to
come
