preface
but
for
a
fantasy
of
nathaniel
hawthorne
this
play
of
course
would
never
have
been
written
in
mosses
from
an
old
manse
the
feathertop
relates
in
some
twenty
pages
of
its
author
s
inimitable
style
how
mother
rigby
a
reputed
witch
of
old
new
england
days
converted
a
scarecrow
into
the
semblance
of
a
fine
gentleman
of
the
period
how
she
despatched
this
semblance
to
play
its
part
in
the
great
world
where
not
one
man
in
a
hundred
she
affirmed
was
gifted
with
more
real
substance
than
itself
how
there
the
scarecrow
while
paying
court
to
pretty
polly
gookin
the
rosy
simpering
daughter
of
justice
gookin
discovered
its
own
image
in
a
returned
to
mother
rigby
s
cottage
and
dissolved
into
its
original
elements
my
indebtedness
therefore
to
this
source
in
undertaking
the
present
play
goes
without
saying
yet
it
would
not
be
true
either
to
hawthorne
s
work
or
my
own
to
classify
the
scarecrow
as
a
dramatization
of
were
it
intended
to
be
such
the
many
radical
departures
from
the
conception
and
the
treatment
of
hawthorne
which
are
evident
in
the
present
work
would
have
to
be
regarded
as
so
many
unwarrantable
liberties
taken
with
its
original
material
the
function
of
the
play
itself
would
in
such
case
become
purely
formal
of
a
narrative
to
its
appropriate
dramatic
form
as
such
however
interesting
and
commendable
an
effort
would
have
lost
all
d
for
the
writer
but
such
i
may
say
has
not
been
my
intention
my
aim
has
been
quite
otherwise
starting
with
the
same
basic
theme
i
have
sought
to
elaborate
it
by
my
own
treatment
to
a
different
and
more
inclusive
issue
without
particularizing
here
the
full
substance
of
hawthorne
s
consummate
sketch
which
is
available
to
every
reader
the
divergence
i
refer
to
may
be
summed
up
briefly
the
scarecrow
feathertop
of
hawthorne
is
the
imaginative
epitome
or
symbol
of
human
charlatanism
with
special
emphasis
upon
the
coxcombry
of
fashionable
society
in
his
essential
superficiality
he
is
characterized
as
a
fop
strangely
with
nobby
little
nose
thrust
into
the
and
many
a
fine
gentleman
says
mother
rigby
has
a
as
well
as
my
his
hollow
semblance
is
the
shallowness
of
a
conventionalism
which
had
incorporated
itself
thoroughly
with
his
substance
and
transformed
him
into
a
work
of
but
the
clothes
in
this
case
were
to
be
the
making
of
the
man
and
so
mother
rigby
after
fitting
him
out
in
a
suit
of
embroidered
finery
endows
him
as
a
finishing
touch
with
a
great
deal
of
brass
which
she
applied
to
his
forehead
thus
making
it
yellower
than
before
with
that
brass
alone
quoth
she
thou
canst
pay
thy
way
all
over
the
similarly
the
other
characters
are
sketched
by
hawthorne
in
accord
with
this
general
conception
pretty
polly
gookin
tossing
her
head
and
managing
her
fan
before
the
mirror
views
therein
an
unsubstantial
little
maid
that
reflected
every
gesture
and
did
all
the
foolish
things
that
polly
did
but
without
making
her
ashamed
of
them
in
short
it
was
the
fault
of
pretty
polly
s
ability
rather
than
her
will
if
she
failed
to
be
as
complete
an
artifice
as
the
illustrious
feathertop
thus
the
reveals
itself
as
a
satire
upon
a
restricted
artificial
phase
of
society
as
such
it
runs
its
brief
course
with
all
the
poetic
charm
and
fanciful
suggestiveness
of
our
great
new
englander
s
prose
style
to
its
appropriate
disintegration
of
its
hero
my
poor
dear
pretty
feathertop
quoth
mother
rigby
with
a
rueful
glance
at
the
relics
of
her
contrivance
there
are
thousands
upon
thousands
of
coxcombs
and
charlatans
in
the
world
made
up
of
just
such
a
jumble
of
forgotten
and
trash
as
he
was
yet
they
live
in
fair
repute
and
never
see
themselves
for
what
they
are
and
why
should
my
poor
puppet
be
the
only
one
to
know
himself
and
perish
for
it
coxcombry
and
charlatanism
then
are
the
butt
of
hawthorne
s
satire
in
his
the
nature
of
his
theme
however
is
susceptible
of
an
application
far
less
restricted
a
development
far
more
universal
than
such
satire
this
wider
issue
once
or
twice
in
his
sketch
he
seems
to
have
touched
upon
only
immediately
to
ignore
again
thus
in
the
very
last
paragraph
mother
rigby
exclaims
poor
feathertop
i
could
easily
give
him
another
chance
and
send
him
forth
again
but
no
feelings
are
too
sensibilities
too
in
these
words
spoken
in
irony
hawthorne
ends
his
narrative
with
an
undeveloped
aspect
of
his
theme
which
constitutes
the
of
the
conception
of
my
play
the
aspect
namely
of
the
essential
of
the
an
aspect
which
in
its
development
inevitably
predicates
for
my
play
a
divergent
treatment
and
a
different
conclusion
the
element
of
human
sympathy
is
here
substituted
for
that
of
irony
as
criterion
of
the
common
absurdity
of
mankind
the
scarecrow
feathertop
is
ridiculous
as
the
emblem
of
a
superficial
fop
the
scarecrow
ravensbane
is
pitiful
as
the
emblem
of
human
bathos
compared
with
our
own
ideas
of
human
perfection
what
human
rubbish
we
are
of
what
incongruous
elements
are
we
constructed
by
time
and
inheritance
wherewith
to
realize
the
reasonableness
the
power
the
altruism
of
our
dreams
what
absurdity
is
our
highest
consummation
yet
the
sense
of
our
common
deficiency
is
after
all
our
salvation
is
one
reality
which
is
a
basic
hope
for
the
realization
of
those
dreams
this
sense
is
human
sympathy
which
is
it
would
seem
a
more
searching
critic
of
human
frailty
than
satire
it
is
the
growth
of
this
sense
which
dowers
with
dignity
and
reality
the
hollowest
and
most
ludicrous
of
mankind
and
becomes
in
such
a
fundamental
grace
of
character
in
a
recent
critical
interpretation
of
cervantes
great
work
professor
woodberry
writes
a
madman
has
no
character
but
it
is
the
character
of
don
quixote
that
at
last
draws
the
knight
out
of
all
his
degradations
and
makes
him
triumph
in
the
heart
of
the
and
he
continues
modern
dismay
begins
in
the
thought
that
here
is
not
the
abnormality
of
an
individual
but
the
madness
of
the
soul
in
its
own
if
for
madness
in
this
quotation
i
may
be
permitted
to
substitute
or
a
more
felicitous
expression
of
my
meaning
as
applied
to
ravensbane
in
this
play
would
be
difficult
to
devise
from
what
has
been
said
it
will
i
trust
be
the
more
clearly
apparent
why
the
scarecrow
can
not
with
any
appropriateness
be
deemed
a
dramatization
of
feathertop
and
why
its
manifold
divergencies
from
the
latter
in
treatment
and
motive
can
not
with
any
just
significance
be
considered
as
liberties
taken
with
an
original
source
dickon
for
example
whose
name
in
the
is
but
a
momentary
invocation
in
the
mouth
of
mother
rigby
becomes
in
my
play
not
merely
the
characterized
visible
associate
of
goody
rickby
blacksmith
bess
but
the
necessary
foil
of
sceptical
irony
to
the
human
growth
of
the
scarecrow
so
too
for
reasons
of
the
play
s
different
intent
goody
rickby
herself
is
differentiated
from
mother
rigby
and
rachel
merton
has
no

of

or
artistic
design

polly
gookin
my
indebtedness
to
the
new

gratefully
acknowledged
but
it
is

i
think
to
distinguish
clearly

aim
and
the

of
feathertop
and
that
of
the
play
in

as
much
in

her
dickon

this
young

deportment

dear
rachel
i
am
really
at
a
loss
your
lordship
s
hand

so
very
peculiar
ravensbane
ah
peculiar
rachel
this
now
is
the
line
of
life
ravensbane
of
life
yes
rachel
but
it
begins
so
abruptly
and
see
it
breaks
off
and
ends
nowhere
and
just
so
here
with
this
line
love
ravensbane
of
love
so
it
breaks
rachel
yes
ravensbane
ah
then
that
must
be
the
line
rachel
i
am
afraid
your
lordship
is
very
fickle
mistress
merton
i
tell
you
gilead
they
are
justice
merton
tush
tush
mistress
merton
tush
to
tush
who
has
been
stifling
his
feelings
at
rachel
s
rebuff
and
has
stood
fidgeting
at
a
civil
distance
from
her
now
walks
up
to
justice
richard
intolerable
do
you
approve
of
sir
are
lord
ravensbane
s
credentials
satisfactory
justice
merton
eminently
eminently
richard
ah
so
her
ladyship
s
letter
justice
merton
charming
charming
richard
to
be
sure
old
friends
when
they
are
lords
it
makes
such
a
difference
dickon
true
friends
new
friends
est
ce
your
worship
justice
merton
indeed
master
dickonson

richard
as
dickon
goes
toward
ravensbane
and

happiness
to
encounter
the
manners
of
the
nobility
richard
if
you
approve
them
sir
it
is
sufficient
this
is
your
house
turns
justice
merton
your
lordship
will
i
trust
make
my
house
your
home
ravensbane
my
home
sir
rachel
dickon
who
has
spoken
to
really
justice
why
uncle
what
is
this
master
dickonson
tells
us
justice
merton
what
what
he
has
rachel
yes
indeed
why
did
you
never
tell
us
justice
merton
rachel
rachel
mistress
merton
you
are
moved
brother
rachel
to
my
uncle
is
doubtless
astonished
to
find
you
so
grown
ravensbane
to
justice
i
am
doubtless
astonished
sir
to
be
so
grown
justice
merton
you
dickon
remarked
sir
that
your
worship
had
often
dandled
his
an
infant
justice
merton
quite
an
infant
merely
rachel
how
interesting
then
you
must
have
seen
his
lordship
s
home
in
england
justice
merton
as
you
say
rachel
do
describe
it
to
us
we
are
so
isolated
here
from
the
grand
world
do
you
know
i
always
imagine
england
to
be
an
enchanted
isle
like
one
of
the
old
hesperides
teeming
with
fruits
of
solid
gold
ravensbane
ah
yes
my
mother
raises
them
rachel
fruits
of
gold
ravensbane
round
like
the
rising
sun
she
calls
punkins
mistress
merton
punkins
justice
merton
grinding
his
scoundrel
scoundrel
rachel
your
lordship
pokes
fun
at
us
dickon
his
lordship
is
an
artist
in
words
mistress
i
have
noticed
that
in
whatever
country
he
is
travelling
he
tinges
his
vocabulary
with
the
local
idiom
his
lordship
means
of
course
not
pumpkins
but
pomegranates
rachel
we
forgive
him
but
your
lordship
please
be
serious
and
describe
to
us
your
hall
ravensbane
quite
serious
the
hall
yes
yes
in
the
middle
burns
a
great
a
altar
dickon
a
druidical
heirloom
his
lordship
s
mother
collects
antiques
rachel
how
fascinating
ravensbane
quite
fascinating
on
the
walls
hang
pieces
of
iron
dickon
trophies
of
saxon
warfare
ravensbane
and
rusty
horseshoes
general
murmurs
horseshoes
dickon
presents
from
the
german
emperor
they
were
worn
by
the
steeds
of
charlemagne
ravensbane
quite
so
and
broken
dickon
reliques
of
british
chariots
rachel
how
mediæval
it
must
be
justice
and
to
think
you
never
described
it
to
us
mistress
merton
true
brother
you
have
been
singularly
reticent
justice
merton
permit
me
it
is
impossible
to
report
all
one
sees
on
one
s
travels
mistress
merton
evidently
rachel
but
surely
your
lordship
s
mother
has
other
diversions
besides
collecting
antiques
i
have
heard
that
in
england
ladies
followed
the
hounds
and
at
her
aunt
and
lowering
her
they
even
dance
ravensbane
yes
my
lady
mother
dances
about
altar
she
swings
high
a
hammer
dickon
your
lordship
your
lordship
pray
sir
check
this
vein
of
poetry
lord
ravensbane
symbolizes
as
a
hammer
and
altar
a
and
scottish
game
which
her
ladyship
plays
on
her
highland
estates
richard
mistress
what
do
you
think
of
this
mistress
merton
a
scandalized
look
toward
her
he
said
to
me
richard
justice
merton
indicating
who
is
this
magpie
justice
merton
in
satan
richard
i
beg
pardon
justice
merton
satan
you
jealous
richard
good
morning
up
to
lord
ravensbane
i
have
a
rustic
colonial
question
to
ask
is
it
the
latest
fashion
to
smoke
incessantly
in
ladies
parlours
or
is
dickon
his
lordship
s
health
sir
richard
i
addressed
his
lordship
ravensbane
in
the
matter
of
fashions
his
pipe
to
be
my
pipe
dickon
dickon
holds
his
longer
than
with
his
mouth
open
as
if
about
to
speak
relapses
into
a
vacant
dickon
he
lights
the
pipe
for
ravensbane
speaks
suavely
and
low
as
if
not
to
be
overheard
by
pardon
me
the
fact
is
my
young
pupil
is
sensitive
the
wound
from
his
latest
duel
is
not
quite
healed
you
observe
a
slight
lameness
an
occasional
absence
of
mind
rachel
a
a
real
duel
richard
necessitates
his
smoking
a
valid
reason
dickon
you
mistress
know
the
lordship
s
heart
rachel
believe
me
richard
ravensbane
who
is
still
staring
vacantly
into
well
well
your
lordship
pays
no
you
were
returns
the
in
the
matter
of
fashions
ravensbane
slowly
a
look
of
intelligence
draws
himself
up
with
affronted
permit
me
several
wreaths
of
smoke
into
the
i
the
fashions
richard
insufferable
pauses
at
the
mistress
merton

charles
himself
mistress
merton
brother
brother
is
there
nothing
wrong
here
justice
merton

of
the
manners
of

great
mistress

merton
where
are
you
going
mistress
merton
to
my

that
again
and

merton
withdraw
to
a
corner
of
the
rachel
to
the
smoke
why
i
think
it
is
charming
richard
has
returned
from
the
door

in
a
low
constrained
rachel
rachel

a

of

full
in
richard

act
iii
same
day
late
afternoon
the
same
scene
as
act
ravensbane
dickon
at
table
on
which
are
lying
two
flails
ravensbane
is
dressed
in
a
costume
which
composed
of
silk
and
jewels
subtly
approximates
in
design
to
that
of
his
original
grosser
composition
so
artfully
however
is
this
contrived
that
to
one
ignorant
of
his
origin
his
dress
would
appear
to
be
merely
an
odd
personal
whimsy
whereas
to
one
initiated
it
would
stamp
him
grotesquely
as
the
apotheosis
of
is
sitting
in
a
pedagogical
attitude
ravensbane
stands
near
him
making
a
profound
bow
in
the
opposite
ravensbane
believe
me
ladies
with
the
true
sincerity
of
the
heart
dickon
inflection
a
little
more
lachrymose
please
the
sincerity
of
the
ravensbane
believe
me
ladies
with
the
sincerity
of
the
dickon
prettily
prettily
next
ravensbane
his
mien
as
if
addressing
another
verily
sir
as
that
prince
of
poets
the
immortal
virgil
has
remarked
adeo
in
teneris
consuescere
multum
dickon
hm
act
up
to
the
sentiment
ravensbane
verily
sir
as
that
dickon

will
inform

impress
all
of
the
guests
this
afternoon

exquisite
flower
of
love
how
thy
natal
composites

thee
to
a
golden
collarette
thy
mop
of

but
continue
cobby
dear
the
retort
now
to
the
challenge
ravensbane
a
superb
the
second
i
believe
dickon
quite
so
my
lord
ravensbane
sir
the
local
person
whom
you
represent
has
done
himself
the
honour
of
submitting
to
me
a
challenge
to
mortal
combat
sir
since
the
remotest
times
of
my
feudal
ancestors
in
such
affairs
of
honour
choice
of
weapons
has
ever
been
the
prerogative
of
the
challenged
sir
this
right
of
etiquette
must
be
observed
nevertheless
believe
me
i
have
no
selfish
desire
that
my
superior
attainments
in
this
art
should
assume
advantage
over
my
challenger
s
ignorance
i
have
therefore
chosen
those
combative
utensils
most
appropriate
both
to
his
own
humble
origin
and
to
local
tradition
permit
me
sir
to
reveal
my
choice
grandly
to
the
there
are

not
a
more
punctual
manikin
than

all
my
soul
rachel
so
do
is
innocent
witchcraft
not
to
harm
anybody
you
know
but
just
to
feel
all
the
dark
mystery
and
the
trembling
way
you
feel
when
you
blow
out
your
candle
all
alone
in
your
bedroom
and
watch
the
little
smoke
fade
away
in
the
moonshine
ravensbane
fade
away
in
the
moonshine
rachel

but
we
mustn
t
speak
of
it
in

considered
damnable

lordship
understands
and
approves

philosophical
considerations

man
lord
ravensbane
i
would

england

ninny
rachel

speech

fancy
i
have
insulted

his
challenge
one
insult
may
perhaps
be
remedied

another

the
immortal
virgil
has
remarked
adeo
in
teneris
consuescere
multum
dickon
just
a
word
your
worship
justice
merton
with
intolerable
rev
master
todd
his
lordship
is
evidently
a
university
man
rev
master
rand
evidently
most
accomplished
justice
merton
to
a
song
why
it
is
beyond
all
bounds
of
custom
and
decorum
dickon
believe
me
there
is
no
such
flatterer
to
win
the
maiden
heart
as
music
justice
merton
and
here
in
this
presence
never
dickon
nevertheless
it
will
amuse
me
vastly
and
you
will
announce
it
ravensbane
minister
my
opinion
is
simple
in
such
matters
of
church
government
i
am
inclined
toward
the
leniency
of
that
excellent
master
the
rev
john
wise
rather
than
the
righteous
obduracy
of
the
rev
cotton
mather
minister
dodge
why
there
sir
i
agree
with
you
to
his
how
extremely
well
informed
mistress
dodge
and
so
young
too
justice
merton
hesitant
embarrassment
which
he
seeks
to
your
excellency
and
friends
i
have
great
pleasure
in
announcing
his
lordship
s
condescension
in
consenting
to
regale
our
present
a
song
several
voices
various
degrees
of
amazement
and
a
song
mistress
merton
gilead
what
is
this
justice
merton
the
selection
is
a
german
particular
favourite
at
the
court
of
prussia
where
his
lordship
last
rendered
it
his
tutor
has
made
a
translation
which
is
entitled
the
prognostication
of
the
crows
and
i
am
requested
to
remind
you
that
in
the
ancient
heathen
mythology
of
germany
the
crow
or
raven
was
the
fateful
bird
of
the
god
woden
captain
bugby
how
prodigiously
novel
minister
dodge
unparalleled
sir
charles
a
ballad
come
now
that
sounds
like
old
england
again
let
s
have
it
will
his
lordship
sing
without
music
justice
merton
master
dickonson
hem
has
accompany
his

on
the
virginals
amelia
how
delightful
rev
master

remain

todd
we
must
ravensbane
my

dear

you
do
not
wear

rachel
my
heart
still
wavers
my
lord
but
whilst
you
sing
i
will
decide
ravensbane
whilst
i
sing
my
fate
then
is
waiting
at
the
end
of
a
song
rachel
at
the
end
of
a
song
dickon
ravensbane
s
your
lordship
ravensbane
turns
to
the
permit
me
sits
facing
left
at
the
virginals
at
first
his
fingers
in
playing
give
sound
only
to
the
soft
tinkling
notes
of
that
ancient
instrument
but
gradually
strange
notes
and
harmonies
of
an
aërial
orchestra
mingle
with
and
at
length
drown
the
virginals
the
final
chorus
is
produced
solely
by
fantastic
symphonic
cawings
as
of
countless
crows
in
harsh
but
musical
accord
during
the
song
richard
enters
dickon
s
music
however
does
not
cease
but
fills
the
intervals
between
the
verses
to
his
accompaniment
amid
the
whispered
and
gradually
increasing
wonder
resentment
and
dismay
of
the
assembled
guests
ravensbane
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
rachel

ravensbane
getting
to
his

out
into

ravensbane
what

high
up
through

place
your
viewless
hand
upon
my
brow
and
say
be
comforted

changed
the
world

ludicrous
but
you
have
converted
it
to
loveliness
that
even
this
shadow
of
a
mockery

cast
by
your
light
gives
me
the
dear
assurance

has
blessed
me
a
million
trees
of
stones
of
stars
of
men
of

swum
like

before
my

work
is
the
most
notable
addition
that
has
been
made
for
many
years
to
american
dramatic
literature
it
is
true
poetic
tragedy
charged
with
happy
inspiration
dignified
eloquent
passionate
imaginative
and
thoroughly
human
in
its
emotions
and
whether
considered
in
the
light
of
literature
or
drama
need
not
fear
comparison
with
anything
that
has
been
written
by
stephen
phillips
or
john
davidson
masterfully
written
with
deep
pathos
and
unmistakable
poetic
york
evening
the
critic
of
the
says
mr
mackaye
has
planned
his
scheme
with
both
the
exactitude
of
the
stage
director
and
the
imagination
of
the
poet
we
remember
no
drama
by
any
modern
writer
that
at
once
seems
so
readable
and
so
actable
and
no
play
that
is
so
excellent
in
stage
technique
so
clear
in
characterization
and
so
completely
filled
with
the
atmosphere
of
romance
and
the
force
and
vigor
and
beautiful
imagery
of
mackaye
s
happy
experiment
in
classic
form
are
evident
it
is
finer
and
stronger
better
knit
than
his
jeanne
d
arc
which
sothern
and
marlowe
have
found
an
acceptable
addition
to
their
repertory
this
play
is
mark
in
american
dramatic
mr
mackaye
s
verse
is
varied
virile
and
essentially
dramatic
with
here
and
there
bits
which
stand
out
with
rare
york
dramatic
it
has
beauty
of
spirit
grace
and
distinction
of
style
and
power
enough
to
commend
it
to
a
friendly
reading
by
lovers
of
dramatic
many
are
awakening
to
the
somewhat
incredulous
but
curiously
persistent
feeling
that
in
sappho
and
phaon
mackaye
has
achieved
a
de
which
will
be
read
with
admiration
for
some
time
to
world
interesting
for
the
dramatic
beauty
of
some
of
its
passages
for
the
originality
of
its
conception
and
as
a
curiosity
of
playwriting
the
tragic
conception
the
shipwreck
of
the
ideal
in
its
passionate

a
series
of
scenes
animated
at
times
by
a
sure
direct
and
simple
poetry
again
by
the
militant

and
finally
by
the
bitter
pathos
of
the
most
moving
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
and
certainly
the
most
inexplicable
story
in

a
singularly
fresh
buoyant
treatment
of
an
old
subject
mackaye
s
jeanne
d
arc
contains
less
pageantry
and
more
spirituality
than
any
of
the
plays
about
the
maid
since
chicago
fenris
the

a
drama
that
shows
triple
greatness
there
is
the
supreme
beauty
of
poetry
the
perfect
sense
of
dramatic
proportion
and
nobility
of

it
is
a
work

in
the
higher
and
better
meaning
of
the
term
it
is
an
original
conception
worked
out
with
a
rare
degree
of
freshness
and
buoyancy
and
it
may
honestly
be
called
a
play
of
unusual
interest
and
unusual
literary
merit
the
drama
might
well
be
called
a
character
portrait
of
chaucer
for
it
shows
him
forth
with
keen
discernment

captivating

is
a
moving
vigorous
play
in

go
rapidly
and
happily

there
are

mr
stephen

is
one
of
not
more
than
three
or
four
living
poets
of
whom
the

finds
himself
compelled
in

his

to

the

are

done

that
for
which
one
is
most
grateful
to
noyes
in
his
strong
and
brilliant
treatment
of
all
his
rich
material
is
the
gift
by
which
in
my
opinion
he
stands

besides
some

have
been

only
in

unknown

the

bears
out
the
verdict
of
the
it
has
seemed
to
us
from
the
first
that
noyes
has
been
one
of
the
most
figures
in
