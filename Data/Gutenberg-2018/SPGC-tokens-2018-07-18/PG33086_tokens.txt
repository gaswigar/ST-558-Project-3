they
are

by
the
portrait
i
felix
brun
perched
like
a
little
bird
on
the
steps
of
the
rede
art
gallery
gazed
up
and
down
bond
street
with
his
sharp
eyes
for
someone
to
whom
he
might
show
yale
ross
portrait
of
the
duchess
of
wrexe
the
afternoon
was
warm
the
date
may
of
the
year
and
the
occasion
was
the
young
portrait
painters
first
show
with
ross
duchess
as
its
principal
attraction
brun
was
thrilled
with
excitement
with
emotion
and
he
must
have
his
audience
there
must
be
somebody
to
whom
he
might
talk
to
whom
he
might
explain
exactly
why
this
occasion
was
of
so
stirring
an
importance
his
eyes
lighted
with
satisfaction
coming
towards
him
was
a
tall
gaunt
man
with
a
bronzed
face
loose
clothes
a
stride
that
had
little
of
the
town
about
it
this
was
arkwright
the
explorer
a
man
who
had
been
lost
in
african
jungles
during
the
last
five
years
the
very
creature
for
brun
purposes
here
was
someone
who
knowing
nothing
about
art
would
listen
all
the
more
readily
to
brun
pronouncement
upon
it
a
homely
simple
soul
fitted
for
the
killing
of
lions
and
tigers
but
pliable
as
wax
in
the
hands
of
a
master
of
civilization
like
brun
at
the
same
time
arkwright
was
no
fool
a
psychologist
in
his
way
he
had
written
two
books
about
the
east
that
had
aroused
considerable
interest
no
fool
arkwright
he
would
be
able
to
appreciate
brun
subtleties
and
perhaps
add
some
of
his
own
he
had
however
been
away
from
england
for
so
long
a
time
that
anything
that
brun
had
to
tell
him
about
the
london
world
would
be
pleasantly
fresh
and
stimulating
brun
round
and
neat
and
a
citizen
of
the
world
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
top
of
his
shining
toes
tapped
arkwright
on
his
shoulder
hallo
brun
how
are
you
it
good
to
see
you
have
seen
a
soul
i
know
for
the
last
ever
so
long
good
good
excellent
come
along
in
here
in
there
pictures
what
the
use
of
me
looking
at
pictures
we
can
talk
in
here
i
tell
you
all
the
news
besides
something
that
even
you
will
appreciate
well
arkwright
laughed
and
moved
towards
the
door
what
is
it
the
duchess
brun
answered
him
yale
ross
portrait
of
the
duchess
of
wrexe
at
last
he
triumphantly
cried
at
last
we
got
her
ii
the
duchess
had
a
small
corner
wall
for
her
own
individual
possession
the
thin
glowing
may
sunlight
fell
about
her
and
the
dull
gold
of
her
frame
received
it
and
gave
it
back
with
a
rich
solemnity
as
though
it
had
said
you
have
been
gay
and
unrestrained
enough
with
all
those
crowds
but
here
let
me
tell
you
is
something
that
requires
a
very
different
attitude
the
duchess
received
the
colour
and
the
sunlight
but
made
no
response
she
sat
leaning
forward
a
little
bending
with
one
of
her
dry
wrinkled
hands
over
a
black
ebony
cane
a
high
carved
chair
supporting
and
surrounding
her
she
seemed
herself
to
be
carved
there
stone
marble
anything
lifeless
save
for
her
eyes
the
tense
clutch
of
her
fingers
about
the
cane
and
the
dull
but
brooding
gleam
that
a
large
jade
pendant
the
only
colour
against
the
black
of
her
dress
flung
at
the
observer
her
mouth
was
a
thin
hard
line
her
nose
small
but
sharp
her
colour
so
white
that
it
seemed
to
cut
into
the
paper
and
the
skin
drawn
so
tightly
over
her
bones
that
a
breath
a
sigh
might
snap
it
her
little
body
was
one
might
suppose
shrivelled
with
age
with
the
business
and
pleasure
of
the
world
with
the
pursuit
of
some
great
ambition
or
prize
with
the
battle
unceasing
and
unyielding
over
some
weakness
or
softness
indomitable
remorseless
unhumorous
proud
the
pose
of
the
body
was
absolutely
one
felt
the
justest
possible
on
either
side
of
the
chair
were
two
white
and
green
chinese
dragons
grotesque
with
open
mouths
and
large
flat
feet
a
hanging
tapestry
of
dull
gold
filled
in
the
background
out
upon
these
dull
colours
the
little
body
with
the
white
face
the
shining
eyes
the
clenched
hand
was
flung
poised
sustained
by
its
very
force
and
will
nothing
in
the
world
could
be
so
fierce
as
that
determined
absence
of
ferocity
nothing
so
energetic
as
that
negation
of
all
energy
nothing
so
proud
as
that
contemptuous
rejection
of
all
that
had
to
do
with
pride
it
was
as
though
she
had
said
they
shall
see
nothing
of
me
these
people
i
will
give
them
nothing
and
then
the
green
jade
on
her
bosom
had
betrayed
her
maliciously
the
dragons
grinned
behind
her
back
iii
arkwright
as
he
watched
was
conscious
suddenly
of
an
overwhelming
curiosity
he
had
in
earlier
days
seen
her
portrait
and
always
it
had
been
interesting
suggestive
provocative
but
now
as
he
stood
there
he
was
aware
that
something
quite
definite
something
uncomfortably
disconcerting
had
occurred
life
absurdly
seemed
to
warn
him
that
he
must
prepare
for
some
new
development
the
duchess
had
he
was
aware
taken
notice
of
him
for
the
first
time
little
felix
brun
watched
arkwright
with
interest
they
were
at
that
moment
the
only
persons
in
the
room
and
it
was
as
though
they
had
begged
for
a
private
interview
and
had
been
granted
it
the
other
portraits
of
the
exhibition
had
vanished
into
the
mild
may
afternoon
she
does
like
us
brun
said
laughing
she
turn
the
dragons
on
to
us
if
she
could
it
wonderful
arkwright
moved
back
a
little
young
ross
has
done
it
this
time
no
other
portrait
has
ever
given
one
the
least
idea
of
her
she
be
that
brun
stood
regarding
her
there
never
be
anything
like
her
again
as
far
as
your
england
is
concerned
she
the
very
very
last
and
when
she
goes
a
heap
of
things
will
go
with
her
there
be
other
principalities
and
powers
but
never
power
she
asked
us
to
come
said
arkwright
or
at
any
rate
asked
i
wonder
what
she
wants
she
only
asked
you
said
brun
to
tell
you
how
she
hates
you
and
does
she
my
word
there
were
voices
behind
him
brun
turned
and
arkwright
heard
him
exclaim
beneath
his
breath
then
in
a
moment
the
little
man
was
received
with
why
brun
how
fortunate
we
come
to
see
my
portrait
arkwright
caught
these
words
and
knew
that
the
lady
standing
there
must
be
lady
adela
beaminster
the
duchess
only
daughter
he
had
never
seen
lady
adela
before
but
it
amused
him
now
that
she
should
resemble
so
exactly
the
figure
that
he
had
imagined
it
showed
after
all
that
one
could
take
the
world
verdict
about
these
things
the
world
verdict
about
lady
adela
was
that
she
was
dull
but
important
bearing
her
tall
dried
body
as
a
kind
of
flag
for
the
right
people
to
range
themselves
behind
her
and
range
themselves
they
did
standing
now
with
felix
brun
in
front
of
her
demanding
a
display
of
graciousness
she
extended
her
patronage
thin
with
her
sharp
nose
and
tight
mouth
she
was
like
an
exclamation
mark
that
had
left
off
exclaiming
and
it
was
only
her
ability
to
be
gracious
and
the
sense
that
she
conveyed
of
having
any
number
of
rights
and
possessions
to
stand
for
that
gave
her
claim
to
attention
her
black
hat
was
harsh
her
hair
her
eyes
cold
with
lack
of
intelligence
arkwright
thought
her
unpleasant
standing
a
little
behind
her
was
a
tall
thin
girl
who
was
obviously
determined
to
be
as
ungracious
as
a
protest
against
her
amiability
should
require
the
girl
thinness
was
accentuated
by
her
rather
tightly
clinging
white
dress
and
beneath
her
long
black
gloves
her
hands
moved
a
little
awkwardly
as
though
she
were
not
quite
sure
what
she
should
do
with
them
a
large
black
hat
overshadowed
her
face
but
arkwright
could
see
that
her
eyes
large
and
dark
were
more
beautiful
than
anything
else
about
her
her
nose
was
too
thin
her
mouth
too
large
her
face
too
white
and
pinched
her
body
as
she
stood
there
was
graceful
but
not
yet
disciplined
so
that
she
made
movements
and
then
checked
them
giving
the
impression
that
she
wished
to
do
a
number
of
things
but
was
uncertain
of
the
correctness
of
any
of
them
she
was
of
foreign
blood
arkwright
decided
much
too
black
and
white
for
england
but
it
was
her
expression
that
demanded
his
attention
as
she
watched
felix
brun
talking
to
lady
adela
she
seemed
to
be
longing
to
express
the
contempt
that
she
felt
for
both
of
them
and
yet
to
have
behind
that
desire
a
pathetic
hesitation
as
to
whether
she
had
a
right
to
be
contemptuous
of
anyone
it
was
the
pathos
arkwright
decided
that
one
ultimately
felt
concerning
her
she
looked
lonely
she
looked
frightened
and
she
looked
in
the
devil
of
a
temper
her
black
eyes
would
be
beautiful
whether
they
were
filled
with
tears
or
with
anger
and
it
seemed
that
they
must
very
often
be
filled
with
both
i
would
like
to
have
the
handling
of
her
thought
arkwright
and
then
instantly
after
i
like
to
take
away
some
of
that
loneliness
she
have
a
fine
old
time
he
thought
if
she
is
too
sensitive
lady
adela
had
now
moved
forward
with
brun
to
look
at
the
picture
but
the
girl
did
not
move
with
them
she
did
not
look
at
the
portrait
nor
did
she
appear
to
take
any
interest
in
the
other
pictures
she
stood
there
making
every
now
and
again
little
nervous
movements
with
her
black
gloves
arkwright
moved
about
the
gallery
by
himself
a
little
and
he
was
conscious
that
the
girl
large
black
eyes
followed
him
he
fancied
as
for
an
instant
he
glanced
back
that
the
duchess
from
her
high
wall
leaned
forward
on
her
cane
just
a
little
further
so
that
she
might
force
the
girl
to
give
her
attention
that
girl
got
plenty
of
spirit
thought
arkwright
i
like
to
see
a
battle
between
her
and
the
old
lady
it
would
be
tooth
and
nail
then
once
again
the
door
opened
there
was
again
an
addition
to
the
company
arkwright
was
at
that
moment
facing
the
girl
and
as
he
heard
the
sharp
closing
of
the
door
he
saw
in
her
eyes
the
welcome
that
the
had
received
she
was
transformed
the
pallor
of
her
face
was
now
flooded
with
colour
and
she
seemed
almost
beautiful
as
the
hostility
left
her
and
her
mouth
curved
in
a
smile
of
so
immense
a
relief
that
it
emphasized
indeed
her
earlier
burden
her
whole
body
expressed
the
intensity
of
her
pleasure
her
awkwardness
had
departed
she
was
suddenly
in
possession
of
herself
arkwright
gaze
went
past
her
to
the
door
the
man
who
stood
there
was
greeting
the
girl
with
a
smile
that
had
in
it
both
surprise
and
intimacy
as
though
they
were
the
two
oldest
friends
in
the
world
and
yet
he
was
astonished
to
see
her
there
the
man
was
large
roughly
built
with
big
limbs
and
a
face
that
without
being
beamed
kindness
and
his
eyes
and
mouth
were
sensitive
and
less
ragged
than
the
rest
of
him
his
nose
the
plainest
thing
about
him
was
square
and
too
large
for
his
mouth
his
hair
was
white
although
he
looked
between
forty
and
fifty
years
of
age
his
dress
was
correct
but
he
obviously
did
not
give
his
clothes
more
consideration
than
the
feelings
of
his
friends
required
of
him
ruddy
of
face
with
his
white
hair
and
large
limbs
and
smiling
he
was
pleasant
to
look
upon
and
arkwright
did
not
wonder
at
the
girl
welcome
he
would
be
precisely
the
kind
of
friend
that
she
would
need
benevolent
understanding
strong
they
greeted
one
another
and
then
they
moved
forward
and
spoke
to
lady
adela
and
brun
arkwright
watched
them
there
they
all
were
gathered
together
under
the
sharp
eyes
of
the
duchess
and
she
seemed
so
arkwright
fancied
to
hold
them
with
her
gaze
little
brun
was
neater
than
ever
and
lady
adela
drier
than
ever
by
the
side
of
the
stranger
they
talked
they
were
discussing
the
picture
their
eyes
travelled
up
to
it
and
for
an
instant
there
was
silence
as
though
they
were
all
charging
it
with
their
challenge
or
surrender
as
the
case
might
be
the
girl
eyes
moved
up
to
it
with
a
sudden
sharpened
thinning
of
the
face
that
brought
back
the
gleam
of
hostility
that
it
had
worn
before
then
her
eyes
fell
and
with
a
smile
they
sought
her
friend
arkwright
did
not
know
any
reason
for
his
interest
but
he
watched
them
breathlessly
and
the
sense
that
he
had
had
on
first
entering
the
room
of
being
on
the
verge
of
some
new
experience
deepened
with
him
brun
was
apparently
suddenly
conscious
that
he
had
left
his
friend
alone
long
enough
for
he
detached
himself
from
the
group
shook
hands
with
lady
adela
and
the
girl
bowed
stiffly
to
the
man
and
joined
arkwright
seen
enough
he
said
yes
said
arkwright
they
went
out
together
iv
felix
brun
and
arkwright
were
not
intimate
friends
no
one
was
intimate
with
brun
and
the
little
man
came
and
disappeared
was
there
and
was
not
there
was
absent
for
a
year
and
then
back
again
as
though
he
had
been
away
a
week
was
indeed
simply
a
succession
of
explanatory
footnotes
to
the
social
history
of
europe
it
was
for
the
social
history
of
europe
that
he
lived
for
the
eager
penetrating
gaze
into
this
capital
and
that
something
suddenly
noted
some
case
examined
and
dismissed
life
is
discovered
most
accurately
by
those
who
learn
to
watch
for
its
accidents
rather
than
its
intentions
and
it
was
always
the
things
that
occurred
by
change
that
gave
brun
his
discoveries
he
was
a
cosmopolitan
of
a
multitude
of
acquaintances
no
friends
no
occupation
an
enthusiasm
only
for
cynical
and
pessimistic
observation
invaluable
as
a
commentator
useless
as
a
human
being
when
as
was
now
the
case
some
chance
meeting
had
assisted
his
theories
his
neat
little
body
shone
like
a
celluloid
ball
if
having
made
his
discovery
he
might
also
have
his
audience
to
whom
he
might
declare
it
then
his
very
fingers
quivered
with
the
excitement
of
it
his
hands
white
and
thin
and
tapering
waved
now
his
eyes
were
on
fire
as
they
walked
up
bond
street
one
might
have
imagined
at
his
armpits
mercury
wings
at
his
heels
the
quiet
evening
air
was
charged
with
him
well
said
arkwright
smiling
and
looking
down
at
his
companion
who
are
they
all
lady
adela
beaminster
rachel
beaminster
christopher
christopher
christopher
the
harley
street
man
he
the
duchess
doctor
has
been
for
years
the
girl
was
the
duchess
granddaughter
lady
niece
well
the
girl
coming
out
in
three
days
time
they
giving
a
ball
in
portland
place
for
her
nobody
knows
much
about
her
she
been
educated
abroad
and
always
kept
very
close
when
she
here
i
should
think
the
old
duchess
loves
her
much
she
loved
the
girl
father
but
he
married
a
russian
actress
bolted
to
russia
with
her
and
the
old
lady
never
forgave
him
he
and
the
actress
were
both
killed
in
a
petersburg
fire
and
the
child
was
sent
home
only
tiny
then
ah
that
explains
the
foreign
air
she
had
she
did
look
as
though
she
loved
her
aunt
very
much
either
no
do
suppose
she
does
but
that
not
it
that
not
it
they
had
arrived
now
at
the
top
of
bond
street
and
they
paused
for
a
moment
to
allow
the
oxford
street
traffic
to
sweep
past
them
it
was
an
hour
of
stir
and
clatter
hansoms
carts
lumbering
omnibuses
bicycles
all
were
hurled
along
as
though
by
some
impatient
hand
and
the
evening
light
crept
higher
and
higher
along
the
walls
of
the
street
leaving
shadows
beneath
it
they
crossed
over
and
were
instantly
in
a
dim
golden
voiceless
square
it
was
as
though
a
door
had
been
closed
brun
still
held
arkwright
arm
now
we
can
talk
no
noise
francis
breton
has
come
back
to
arkwright
this
name
unfortunately
conveyed
nothing
you
do
know
brun
was
disappointed
never
heard
of
him
fancy
that
world
of
wonders
what
have
you
been
doing
with
your
time
he
is
the
duchess
grandson
son
of
the
beautiful
the
wonderful
iris
beaminster
who
eloped
with
kit
breton
thirty
years
ago
i
believe
the
old
duchess
pursued
her
relentlessly
until
the
end
they
were
married
only
a
few
years
and
then
iris
breton
committed
suicide
kit
breton
beat
her
and
was
always
drunk
an
absolute
rascal
there
was
one
boy
and
he
wandered
about
europe
with
his
father
until
he
was
twenty
or
so
then
kit
breton
died
and
the
boy
came
home
revenge
on
his
grandmother
was
his
one
idea
he
was
taken
up
by
her
enemies
of
whom
she
always
had
a
goodly
store
and
they
might
have
made
something
out
of
him
if
he
had
developed
his
father
habits
and
finally
been
mixed
up
in
some
gambling
scandal
and
forced
to
leave
the
country
you
can
imagine
what
all
this
was
to
the
beaminsters
the
great
immaculate
beaminsters
you
can
picture
the
duchess
he
went
and
saw
her
once
but
that
another
story
well
abroad
he
went
and
abroad
he
stayed
just
now
coming
out
of
the
gallery
i
saw
him
you
are
sure
positive
there
could
be
no
mistake
he
just
the
same
a
trifle
tireder
a
trifle
lower
down
but
the
same
oh
yes
it
was
when
brun
was
most
excited
that
he
was
unmistakably
the
foreigner
now
little
exclamations
that
escaped
him
revealed
him
as
a
rule
in
england
he
was
more
english
than
the
english
they
had
left
the
square
and
were
passing
up
harley
street
the
houses
wore
their
accustomed
air
of
profitable
secrecy
the
doors
the
windows
the
brass
knockers
the
white
and
chastened
steps
were
so
discreet
that
sunday
morning
was
the
only
time
in
the
week
when
they
were
really
comfortable
and
at
home
in
every
muffled
hall
there
was
lying
in
wait
a
muffled
beyond
every
muffled
there
was
a
muffled
with
muffled
illustrated
papers
only
the
tinkling
at
long
intervals
of
some
sharp
little
bell
from
some
inner
secrecy
would
pierce
that
horrible
discretion
upon
both
men
that
shining
succession
of
little
brass
plates
produced
its
solemnity
arkwright
was
nevertheless
interested
by
brun
discoveries
he
was
accompanied
as
they
talked
by
that
picture
of
the
thin
dark
girl
moving
restlessly
her
long
gloved
hands
he
could
see
now
that
look
that
she
had
flung
at
the
picture
oh
she
was
interesting
but
tell
me
brun
he
said
you
go
on
so
fast
as
i
understand
you
there
are
these
two
breton
and
the
girl
both
of
them
the
result
of
tragedies
do
they
know
one
another
do
you
suppose
no
the
girl
was
only
a
small
child
when
breton
was
in
england
and
you
can
be
sure
that
she
was
carefully
kept
out
of
his
way
but
now
that
he
back
now
that
he
back
it
the
girl
that
interests
me
said
arkwright
oh
the
girl
brun
was
almost
contemptuous
there
you
go
english
sentiment
missing
all
the
time
the
great
thing
the
splendid
thing
explain
arkwright
said
laughing
i
know
you
wo
be
happy
until
you
have
why
it
the
duchess
the
duchess
the
duchess
all
the
time
she
the
centre
of
the
picture
she
the
picture
the
subject
arkwright
said
nothing
brun
tossed
his
hands
in
the
air
oh
you
english
no
wonder
you
centuries
behind
everything
you
miss
the
very
things
under
your
nose
there
the
duchess
sitting
there
a
great
figure
as
she
has
been
these
sixty
years
but
a
figure
hidden
veiled
there
she
has
been
for
the
last
thirty
years
shut
up
in
that
great
house
wrapped
about
and
concealed
nobody
knows
what
the
matter
was
i
do
know
i
should
think
christopher
the
only
man
who
can
tell
at
any
rate
thirty
years
ago
she
retired
altogether
from
the
world
and
sees
only
the
fewest
of
people
but
all
the
ceremony
goes
on
dressing
up
receiving
and
the
influence
she
has
she
was
powerful
enough
before
she
disappeared
but
since
why
there
no
pie
she
her
finger
in
politics
society
revolution
life
death
nothing
goes
on
without
her
knowledge
her
approval
her
disapproval
her
family
poor
dears
oh
they
love
it
at
any
rate
the
ones
who
are
left
do
the
rebels
are
the
younger
generation
society
in
england
my
dear
arkwright
is
dissolved
into
three
divisions
the
autocrats
the
aristocrats
and
the
democrats
i
take
my
hat
off
to
the
aristocrats
the
chichesters
the
medleys
the
darrants
the
weddons
all
those
quiet
decorous
people
poor
as
mice
many
of
them
standing
aside
altogether
from
any
movements
or
of
the
day
living
in
their
quiet
little
houses
or
their
empty
big
ones
clever
some
of
them
charitable
all
of
them
but
never
asserting
their
position
or
estimating
it
they
never
look
about
them
and
see
where
they
are
they
no
need
to
they
just
there
the
democrats
are
quite
a
new
development
not
much
of
them
at
present
the
ruddards
the
denisons
the
oaks
but
we
shall
hear
a
lot
of
them
in
the
future
i
sure
they
sacrifice
anything
for
cleverness
they
must
be
amused
life
must
be
entertaining
they
embrace
everybody
actors
americans
writers
they
quite
clever
mind
you
and
it
all
perfectly
genuine
they
not
snobs
they
say
are
our
lands
and
our
titles
you
common
and
vulgar
but
you
got
brains
you
amusing
and
we
well
born
let
make
an
exchange
life
must
be
fun
for
us
so
we
have
anyone
with
money
or
talent
then
last
of
all
the
autocrats
the
beaminsters
the
gutterils
the
ministers
i
using
autocrat
in
its
broadest
sense
but
that
just
what
they
are
you
have
your
quarterings
and
you
must
look
down
on
those
who
have
but
more
than
that
everything
must
be
preserved
and
continual
ceremonies
dignities
chastities
restraints
pomps
and
circumstances
above
all
no
one
must
be
admitted
within
the
company
who
is
not
of
the
noblest
the
stupidest
the
narrowest
the
beaminsters
are
the
bodyguard
of
this
little
army
and
the
duchess
is
their
general
there
behind
her
shut
doors
she
keeps
it
all
going
an
american
like
bronson
a
democrat
like
george
lent
she
spoils
their
games
here
there
everywhere
so
far
all
has
been
well
but
at
last
there
are
enemies
within
her
gates
that
girl
breton
now
at
last
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
must
look
out
he
paused
they
had
reached
portland
place
to
right
and
left
of
them
the
broad
road
was
golden
in
the
sun
dark
trees
guarded
one
end
of
it
bronzed
roofs
the
other
two
carriages
stood
like
sentinels
at
the
upper
end
brun
raised
his
hand
as
though
he
would
invoke
the
spirit
of
it
there
arkwright
there
your
subject
the
duchess
tiny
indomitable
brooding
over
this
place
this
square
of
london
round
the
circus
your
prostituted
street
this
splendour
harley
street
morris
square
with
its
respectability
ferris
street
with
its
over
them
all
the
duchess
is
ruling
there
not
one
of
them
i
dare
fancy
that
is
not
conscious
of
her
existence
not
one
of
them
that
will
not
see
life
differently
when
she
is
gone
meanwhile
she
fight
for
her
autocrats
to
the
last
breath
and
she
got
a
battle
in
front
of
her
that
will
take
her
all
her
time
and
when
she
goes
the
autocrats
will
go
with
her
the
beaminsters
as
beaminsters
will
be
done
for
life
here
round
the
circus
will
never
be
the
same
again
there
a
new
city
rising
arkwright
and
the
new
citizens
may
forget
the
aristocrats
may
compromise
with
the
democrats
but
they
turn
out
the
autocrats
a
lot
of
good
things
will
go
with
them
good
old
things
but
a
lot
of
fine
new
things
will
come
in
as
they
passed
out
of
portland
place
the
touched
his
hat
to
them
will
come
in
said
arkwright
laughing
perhaps
said
brun
gravely
arkwright
shook
his
head
you
can
talk
brun
you
can
say
a
lot
but
it
artificial
the
whole
of
it
your
subject
as
you
call
it
is
in
the
air
we
realists
nowadays
you
know
brun
flat
stared
at
them
with
its
hideous
red
brick
and
ugly
shapelessness
no
romance
for
dent
street
the
glittering
expanse
of
portland
place
was
gone
you
ca
be
a
realist
only
if
you
to
do
the
duchess
properly
said
brun
there
more
than
that
wanted
chapter
ii
rachel
my
dear
thing
it
all
comes
back
as
everything
always
does
simply
to
personal
pluck
it
only
a
question
no
matter
when
or
where
of
having
enough
henry
james
i
no
portland
place
was
the
house
where
the
duchess
of
wrexe
had
lived
now
for
sixty
years
on
the
left
as
you
go
towards
the
park
it
had
an
air
that
no
other
house
in
the
place
had
ever
been
able
to
catch
there
were
certain
buildings
nos
for
instance
that
were
obviously
doing
their
little
best
to
present
a
successful
imitation
but
they
were
left
a
long
a
very
long
way
behind
the
interesting
thing
would
be
to
know
whether
no
had
had
that
wonderful
note
sixty
years
ago
when
the
duchess
came
to
it
probably
not
it
was
beyond
question
her
presence
that
had
thus
given
it
its
distinction
its
grim
facade
without
her
would
not
so
strangely
have
hinted
at
beauties
and
wonders
and
glories
within
nor
would
the
windows
have
gleamed
so
finely
nor
the
great
have
symbolized
such
rich
dark
depths
here
the
temple
of
the
beaminsters
here
therefore
the
shrine
of
all
that
is
best
and
finest
in
english
aristocracy
it
was
indeed
the
largest
house
in
portland
place
and
most
of
the
houses
there
were
large
but
across
that
blank
austere
front
more
was
written
than
mere
size
it
was
age
at
its
most
scornful
but
observant
age
an
age
that
could
compare
one
period
with
another
an
age
that
had
not
forgotten
the
things
that
belonged
to
its
youth
there
was
very
little
up
and
down
portland
place
at
morning
at
midday
at
night
that
the
house
did
not
perceive
those
high
broad
shining
windows
were
not
as
other
windows
there
was
assertion
in
their
very
bland
stupidity
within
the
house
was
dark
and
cold
with
high
square
rooms
wide
stone
staircase
and
a
curious
capacity
for
clutching
any
boisterous
or
seedy
humanity
on
the
very
threshold
and
strangling
it
from
the
hall
the
great
stone
staircase
was
the
feature
it
struck
a
chill
at
once
into
the
heart
of
the
visitor
so
vast
was
it
so
cold
and
white
so
uncompromising
so
scornful
of
other
less
solid
staircases
very
ancient
too
went
back
a
long
long
way
and
would
last
just
like
that
for
ever
what
people
it
must
have
known
what
scenes
what
catastrophes
encountered
about
it
on
either
side
the
hall
vanished
into
blackness
here
a
gleaming
portrait
there
some
antlers
here
again
an
gentleman
with
a
full
wig
and
the
beaminster
nose
and
comfortable
contempt
in
his
eyes
and
around
and
about
it
all
silence
no
sound
from
any
part
of
the
house
penetrated
here
up
the
stone
staircase
passages
doors
more
family
portraits
more
staircase
more
passages
more
doors
and
somewhere
in
some
hidden
solemnity
the
ticking
of
a
clock
so
lonely
in
all
that
silence
that
every
now
and
again
it
would
catch
its
breath
with
a
little
whir
as
though
it
wondered
whether
it
really
could
go
on
in
the
teeth
of
so
contemptuous
an
indifference
rachel
beaminster
overlooked
portland
place
and
caught
the
sun
on
lucky
days
for
quite
a
time
it
was
small
square
of
shape
like
a
box
with
a
high
window
a
tiny
fireplace
an
and
a
squat
table
with
a
bright
blue
cloth
always
during
the
two
years
that
had
been
devoted
to
finishing
in
munich
she
had
had
that
little
room
cosy
compact
before
her
now
did
it
seem
a
little
shabby
the
carpet
and
tablecloth
and
curtains
a
little
faded
it
yet
had
its
cosiness
there
in
the
heart
of
the
great
waste
and
desert
that
the
house
presented
to
her
the
little
silver
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
had
struck
five
she
had
come
back
with
aunt
adela
from
the
picture
gallery
and
hearing
voices
in
the
long
the
voices
said
my
dear
adela
we
just
came
adela
dear
how
well
she
slipped
up
the
stairs
and
secured
her
own
refuge
and
rang
for
tea
to
be
brought
to
her
there
she
wanted
to
think
she
wanted
to
lie
in
the
there
with
the
window
a
little
open
and
the
evening
air
coming
from
the
park
across
portland
place
curiously
scented
like
the
sea
as
she
lay
back
in
her
chair
her
body
seemed
fragile
and
almost
in
its
abandonment
exhausted
under
the
black
eyes
her
cheeks
and
neck
were
very
white
and
her
black
hair
gave
it
all
the
intensest
setting
she
tired
horribly
tired
and
she
wondered
vaguely
as
she
lay
there
how
she
was
ever
to
manage
this
life
that
in
three
days
time
she
must
take
up
and
carry
a
life
that
offered
perhaps
a
little
freedom
a
little
release
but
so
many
so
many
terrors
as
her
gaze
took
in
the
little
room
its
grey
paper
a
photograph
of
uncle
john
a
with
poets
some
miscellaneous
and
novels
and
a
number
of
little
red
carlyles
a
china
cockatoo
with
an
impertinent
stare
a
copy
of
furze
ride
and
a
of
red
munich
roofs
signed
mary
a
tiny
with
one
old
yellow
photograph
of
a
sad
dark
woman
in
a
silver
frame
these
things
were
it
seemed
the
only
friendly
things
she
knew
outside
this
room
there
was
her
grandmother
the
house
london
the
world
more
and
more
horrible
as
the
circles
grew
wider
and
wider
at
the
mere
thought
of
the
things
that
she
must
in
three
days
time
face
her
heart
began
to
beat
so
that
she
could
scarcely
breathe
and
with
that
beating
came
the
iron
determination
that
no
one
should
ever
know
she
could
not
remember
a
time
when
these
two
emotions
had
not
come
together
she
saw
as
though
it
had
happened
only
an
hour
ago
a
tiny
child
in
a
black
frock
stumbling
across
endless
deserts
of
carpet
towards
someone
who
looked
older
and
more
curious
than
anything
one
could
have
conceived
possible
someone
sitting
in
a
high
carved
chair
someone
leaning
on
a
stick
with
two
terrifying
great
dragons
behind
her
the
child
was
seized
with
such
a
panic
that
her
breath
came
in
little
pumping
gasps
her
legs
quivered
and
trembled
her
mouth
was
open
her
eyes
like
saucers
and
then
suddenly
after
what
had
seemed
a
century
of
time
there
came
the
thin
trembling
voice
why
the
child
an
idiot
since
that
awful
day
rachel
had
determined
that
no
one
should
ever
know
there
had
come
to
her
at
that
moment
the
knowledge
that
round
every
corner
there
might
lurk
dragons
and
a
witch
sometimes
they
were
there
sometimes
they
were
not
but
always
there
was
the
terror
before
the
corner
was
turned
life
for
rachel
during
those
early
years
was
one
long
determination
to
meet
bravely
that
from
six
to
every
evening
at
five
minutes
before
six
down
the
long
passages
she
would
be
led
then
would
come
the
short
pause
before
the
dark
door
a
pause
when
the
beating
of
the
child
heart
seemed
the
only
sound
in
the
vast
house
then
the
knock
someone
voice
come
in
then
the
slow
opening
of
the
door
the
revelation
of
the
strange
dim
room
with
the
old
mirrors
the
purple
carpet
the
china
dragons
and
grandmother
in
the
high
carved
chair
there
was
always
in
the
hottest
weather
a
fire
burning
always
dorchester
a
large
ugly
woman
behind
the
chair
always
the
cockatoo
on
a
golden
perch
and
crying
out
every
now
and
again
with
shrill
hostile
cries
and
then
in
the
centre
of
this
grandmother
with
her
terrible
hands
her
terrible
nose
her
terrible
eyes
and
most
terrible
of
all
her
voice
rachel
would
sit
upright
on
her
chair
and
very
often
nothing
would
be
said
throughout
the
sometimes
dorchester
would
ask
questions
such
as
and
what
has
miss
rachel
been
doing
did
miss
rachel
enjoy
her
walk
in
the
park
this
afternoon
has
miss
rachel
enjoyed
her
lessons
sometimes
and
these
were
the
terrible
occasions
her
grandmother
would
speak
well
have
you
been
a
good
little
girl
or
tell
me
what
you
have
been
doing
child
at
the
sound
of
that
voice
the
room
would
flood
with
terror
the
child
would
still
by
an
effort
of
will
her
body
she
could
feel
now
from
all
that
distance
of
years
the
discipline
that
it
had
needed
to
steady
her
little
black
legs
that
dangled
from
her
chair
she
learnt
in
time
to
control
herself
so
that
she
could
give
long
answers
in
a
grave
reserved
tone
the
old
lady
never
moved
as
she
spoke
only
bent
forward
and
stared
at
her
as
though
she
would
see
whether
it
were
the
truth
that
she
were
speaking
as
the
days
passed
and
rachel
grew
older
it
was
around
this
that
the
house
ranged
itself
the
things
in
it
the
rooms
the
passages
the
stairs
the
high
cold
schoolroom
with
its
shining
maps
and
large
frigid
table
the
tapestry
room
long
and
dark
and
mysterious
with
strange
beasts
and
horsemen
waving
in
the
dusk
the
white
so
delicate
and
fragile
that
the
furniture
seemed
to
be
all
holding
its
breath
as
though
a
little
motion
in
the
air
would
dissipate
it
the
vast
with
the
great
hanging
candelabra
and
the
family
portraits
and
the
stone
fireplace
all
these
things
existed
only
that
that
terrible
might
fling
its
shadow
about
the
day
the
child
was
much
alone
she
had
governesses
a
music
master
a
drawing
master
but
from
these
persons
however
friendly
they
might
be
she
held
aloof
she
told
them
nothing
of
her
thoughts
she
had
behind
her
her
very
early
years
that
were
now
to
her
like
a
dream
she
did
not
know
that
it
had
ever
really
existed
that
picture
of
snow
and
some
dark
kind
figure
that
was
always
beside
her
protecting
her
and
in
the
air
always
a
noise
of
bells
as
she
grew
older
that
picture
was
not
dimmed
in
the
vision
of
it
but
only
she
doubted
its
authenticity
nevertheless
the
memory
provided
a
standard
and
before
that
standard
these
governesses
were
compelled
to
yield
there
were
of
course
her
uncles
and
her
aunt
aunt
adela
was
more
immediately
concerned
in
the
duty
of
her
niece
progress
than
any
other
but
as
a
duty
she
always
from
the
first
represented
it
from
that
first
morning
when
she
had
given
her
cold
dry
cheek
to
the
little
girl
to
kiss
until
now
three
days
before
rachel
freedom
she
had
made
no
suggestion
nor
provocation
of
affection
it
is
a
business
my
dear
niece
she
seemed
to
say
that
for
the
sake
of
our
family
we
must
go
through
let
us
be
honest
and
deny
all
foolish
sentiment
to
this
rachel
was
only
too
ready
to
agree
she
did
not
like
her
aunt
adela
aunt
adela
resembled
a
dry
wintry
tree
a
tree
whose
branches
cracked
and
snapped
a
tree
that
gave
no
hope
of
any
spring
rachel
always
saw
aunt
adela
as
an
ugly
necessity
she
was
not
a
thing
of
terror
but
merely
something
unpleasant
something
frigid
and
of
a
lukewarm
hostility
then
there
were
the
uncles
uncle
vincent
uncle
john
and
uncle
richard
uncle
vincent
the
duke
was
over
sixty
now
and
very
like
his
mother
withered
and
sharp
and
shrivelled
but
he
was
without
her
terror
being
merely
dapper
and
insignificant
and
his
sleek
hair
there
was
only
a
little
of
it
very
carefully
spread
out
and
his
white
spats
were
the
most
prominent
things
about
him
he
was
fond
rachel
gathered
of
his
racing
and
his
club
and
his
meals
and
he
was
unmarried
uncle
richard
had
been
twice
prime
minister
and
was
a
widower
he
lived
in
a
beautiful
house
in
grosvenor
street
and
collected
wine
and
fans
and
first
editions
he
was
always
very
kind
to
rachel
and
she
liked
his
tall
thin
figure
bent
a
little
with
his
high
white
forehead
on
the
beaminster
nose
and
beautiful
long
white
hands
she
went
to
have
tea
with
him
sometimes
and
this
was
an
hour
of
freedom
and
delight
because
he
talked
to
her
about
the
elizabethans
and
homer
and
when
she
was
older
nietzsche
and
kant
she
liked
the
warm
rooms
with
their
thick
curtains
and
soft
carpets
and
rows
and
rows
of
gleaming
glittering
books
and
he
always
had
tea
in
such
beautiful
china
and
the
silver
teapot
shone
like
a
mirror
but
she
never
felt
that
she
was
of
the
same
value
to
him
as
a
first
edition
would
be
and
he
talked
to
her
of
the
elizabethans
for
their
sake
and
not
for
hers
lastly
there
was
uncle
john
and
her
heart
was
divided
between
uncle
john
and
christopher
uncle
john
was
a
dear
he
was
round
and
fat
with
hair
that
had
waves
in
it
and
his
face
resembled
that
of
a
very
very
pig
his
nose
was
not
in
the
least
a
beaminster
nose
being
round
and
snub
and
his
eyes
beamed
kindliness
rachel
although
she
had
always
loved
him
had
long
learnt
to
place
no
reliance
upon
him
his
aim
in
life
was
to
make
it
as
comfortable
as
free
from
all
vulgar
squabble
and
dispute
as
pleasant
for
everyone
everywhere
as
it
could
possibly
be
he
was
a
beaminster
in
so
far
as
he
thought
the
beaminsters
were
a
splendid
and
ancient
family
and
that
there
was
no
other
family
to
which
a
man
might
count
himself
so
fortunate
to
belong
but
he
was
kind
and
pleasant
about
the
rest
of
the
world
he
would
like
everyone
to
have
a
good
time
and
it
was
vaguely
a
puzzle
to
him
that
it
should
be
so
arranged
that
life
should
have
any
difficulties
it
would
be
so
much
easier
if
everything
were
pleasant
when
however
difficulties
did
arise
they
must
at
all
costs
be
dismissed
there
had
been
no
time
in
his
life
when
he
had
not
been
in
love
with
some
woman
or
other
but
the
hazards
and
difficulties
of
marriage
had
always
frightened
him
too
much
he
was
not
entirely
selfish
for
he
thought
a
great
deal
about
the
wishes
and
comforts
of
other
people
but
unpleasantness
frightened
him
like
a
rabbit
into
his
hole
he
lived
the
life
of
the
compleat
bachelor
at
portland
place
having
a
multitude
of
friends
of
both
sexes
spending
hours
in
his
clubs
with
some
of
them
in
country
houses
with
others
of
them
and
months
in
delightful
places
abroad
with
one
or
two
of
them
he
was
very
popular
always
smiling
and
and
cared
more
for
rachel
than
for
anyone
else
in
the
world
but
even
for
rachel
he
would
not
risk
discomfort
there
they
all
were
then
gradually
they
had
emerged
for
her
out
of
the
mists
and
shadows
arranging
themselves
about
her
as
possible
protections
against
that
horrible
of
hers
she
soon
found
that
in
that
at
any
rate
they
would
none
of
them
be
of
use
to
her
except
uncle
john
uncle
vincent
did
not
count
at
all
uncle
richard
only
counted
as
china
or
pictures
counted
uncle
john
could
not
count
as
a
very
strong
defence
it
was
true
but
he
was
fond
of
her
he
showed
it
in
a
thousand
ways
and
although
he
might
never
actually
stand
up
for
her
yet
he
would
always
be
there
to
comfort
her
not
that
she
wanted
comfort
from
a
very
early
age
indeed
she
resolutely
flung
from
her
all
props
and
sympathies
and
sentiments
she
hated
the
house
she
hated
the
loneliness
most
of
all
she
hated
grandmother
but
she
would
go
through
with
it
and
no
one
should
know
that
she
suffered
ii
then
when
she
was
seventeen
came
munich
on
the
day
that
she
first
heard
that
she
was
to
go
to
germany
to
be
finished
the
flashing
thought
that
came
to
her
was
that
for
a
time
at
any
rate
the
would
be
suspended
standing
there
thinking
of
the
days
passing
without
the
shadow
of
that
interview
about
them
was
like
emerging
from
some
black
and
screaming
banging
shouting
tunnel
into
the
clear
serenity
of
a
shining
landscape
two
years
might
count
for
her
escape
and
perhaps
on
her
return
she
would
be
old
enough
for
her
grandmother
to
have
lost
her
terrors
perhaps
meanwhile
that
germany
with
its
music
and
forests
and
toys
and
fairies
danced
before
her
her
two
years
in
it
gave
her
all
that
she
had
expected
it
gave
her
wagner
and
mozart
and
beethoven
it
gave
her
goethe
and
heine
jean
paul
and
heyse
hauptmann
and
mörike
it
gave
her
a
perception
of
life
that
admitted
physical
and
spiritual
emotions
on
precisely
the
same
level
so
that
a
sausage
and
the
gave
you
the
same
ecstatic
crawl
down
your
spine
and
did
not
for
an
instant
object
to
sharing
that
honour
munich
also
gave
her
the
experience
and
revelations
of
may
eversley
there
were
some
twenty
or
thirty
girls
who
were
with
rachel
under
the
finishing
care
of
frau
bebel
but
rachel
held
herself
apart
from
them
all
she
could
not
herself
have
explained
why
she
did
so
it
was
partly
because
she
felt
that
she
had
nothing
whether
experience
or
discovery
to
give
to
them
partly
because
they
seemed
already
so
happy
and
comfortable
amongst
themselves
that
they
had
surely
no
need
of
her
and
partly
because
she
feared
that
from
some
person
or
some
place
suddenly
round
the
corner
there
would
spring
the
terror
again
she
could
even
fancy
that
her
grandmother
watching
her
had
placed
horrors
behind
curtains
closed
doors
grimed
and
shuttered
if
you
think
my
dear
she
might
perhaps
be
saying
that
you
escaped
by
this
year
or
two
in
germany
you
mightily
back
to
me
you
coming
but
may
eversley
was
different
from
the
other
girls
she
was
different
because
she
saw
things
without
a
muddle
knew
what
she
wanted
knew
what
she
disliked
knew
what
was
delightful
knew
what
was
intolerable
to
rachel
this
decision
was
more
enviable
than
any
other
quality
that
one
could
have
at
this
stage
of
her
experience
it
was
the
assent
so
it
seemed
to
her
that
could
give
life
its
intensest
value
sit
down
and
see
without
any
exaggeration
or
false
colouring
what
you
got
take
away
ruthlessly
anything
that
you
imagine
that
got
but
have
see
what
you
want
take
away
ruthlessly
everything
that
you
imagine
that
you
would
like
to
have
but
are
not
confident
of
securing
see
what
happened
to
you
in
the
past
take
away
ruthlessly
any
sentimental
repentances
or
sloppy
regrets
but
learn
quite
resolutely
from
your
ugly
mistakes
rachel
world
had
hitherto
been
limited
very
largely
to
the
schoolroom
in
portland
place
the
park
and
beaminster
house
the
country
three
others
one
in
leicestershire
one
in
northumberland
one
in
norfolk
but
even
within
this
limited
country
the
terrific
importance
of
those
rules
was
driven
in
upon
her
she
felt
that
her
grandmother
was
but
no
none
of
the
others
not
aunt
adela
nor
the
uncles
nor
any
of
the
governesses
she
was
allowed
to
meet
one
or
two
little
boys
and
girls
of
her
own
age
she
walked
with
them
in
the
park
played
with
them
at
beaminster
house
had
tea
with
them
occasionally
but
they
were
none
of
them
she
was
not
priggish
about
this
discovery
of
hers
she
did
not
despise
other
people
because
their
definite
rules
did
not
seem
to
them
of
importance
she
did
not
talk
about
these
things
to
see
facts
very
steadily
without
blinking
was
impelled
upon
her
by
the
necessity
for
courage
it
was
the
only
weapon
wherewith
to
fight
her
grandmother
now
she
might
say
to
herself
this
of
yours
is
it
so
bad
what
definitely
do
you
fear
about
it
is
it
the
knock
at
the
door
is
it
the
crossing
the
room
is
it
answering
questions
so
challenged
her
terror
did
fall
a
little
away
from
her
ashamed
at
its
inadequate
cause
so
she
went
to
face
every
peril
is
the
danger
really
so
bad
what
exactly
is
it
may
eversley
was
thin
and
spare
small
with
sharp
features
hair
brushed
sternly
back
and
every
inch
of
her
body
trained
to
the
purpose
that
it
was
meant
to
fulfil
she
rang
her
sentences
on
the
air
like
coin
on
a
plate
meanwhile
as
she
explained
to
rachel
she
had
been
fighting
since
she
was
five
her
mother
lady
eversley
was
the
widow
of
tom
eversley
now
happily
deceased
once
the
most
dissolute
scamp
in
europe
he
had
died
leaving
nothing
but
debts
behind
him
since
then
his
widow
and
his
daughter
had
lived
in
three
little
rooms
above
a
public
house
off
shepherd
market
and
the
widow
had
battled
to
keep
up
the
gayest
of
appearances
may
had
been
at
a
very
early
age
introduced
to
the
struggle
my
silver
mug
and
rattle
were
pawned
to
get
a
dress
for
mother
to
go
to
a
in
i
should
be
here
now
if
it
were
for
an
uncle
and
it
the
last
thing
he
do
for
us
so
back
i
go
in
two
year
time
to
do
my
damnedest
of
course
she
was
she
had
to
be
there
are
only
two
sorts
of
people
she
said
to
rachel
like
soup
thick
and
clear
the
clear
ones
get
on
and
the
thick
do
may
obviously
liked
rachel
but
was
amused
by
her
nobody
it
seemed
to
may
showed
so
nakedly
her
emotions
as
rachel
and
yet
also
nobody
could
produce
more
suddenly
the
closest
of
reserves
may
to
whom
the
world
had
been
since
she
was
six
a
measured
plain
of
contest
marvelled
at
the
poignancy
of
rachel
contact
with
it
if
she
going
to
be
hurt
as
easily
as
this
by
everything
how
on
earth
is
she
going
to
get
through
then
as
the
munich
days
passed
may
found
to
her
own
delight
keen
sense
of
humour
munich
afforded
enough
food
for
it
and
finally
one
discovered
that
rachel
smiled
more
readily
than
she
trembled
but
she
hid
her
smile
because
as
yet
she
was
not
sure
of
it
all
she
wants
may
eversley
concluded
is
to
be
told
things
nobody
in
the
world
could
be
better
adapted
to
give
out
these
revelations
london
to
may
eversley
was
an
open
book
moreover
the
most
stormy
of
on
which
the
combatants
fought
were
wounded
were
slain
were
gloriously
victorious
she
told
rachel
a
great
deal
a
great
deal
about
people
a
great
deal
about
sets
and
parties
a
great
deal
about
likes
and
dislikes
she
had
on
her
side
one
burning
curiosity
to
know
about
rachel
duchess
is
she
as
terrible
so
tremendous
as
people
say
has
she
such
a
brain
even
now
old
lady
grandon
who
was
a
great
friend
when
they
were
both
girls
says
that
she
was
clever
then
a
bit
rather
stupid
and
shy
but
you
never
know
jealousy
on
old
grandon
part
i
expect
they
say
wonderful
still
questions
of
taste
never
worried
may
eversley
and
it
did
not
worry
her
now
that
rachel
might
dislike
so
penetrating
an
inquisition
but
at
least
may
got
nothing
for
her
trouble
rachel
told
her
nothing
may
final
word
was
you
care
too
much
about
it
all
care
whether
going
to
hurt
whether
it
going
to
be
frightening
or
not
my
advice
to
you
is
just
dash
in
snatch
what
you
can
and
dash
out
again
it
does
matter
a
what
anyone
says
everyone
says
everything
in
london
and
nobody
minds
they
all
got
the
shortest
memories
rachel
sitting
now
in
her
little
room
and
thinking
of
munich
wondered
how
completely
her
own
discovery
of
london
would
coincide
with
may
may
idea
of
it
was
certainly
not
aunt
adela
aunt
adela
rachel
thought
was
far
too
dried
and
brittle
to
risk
any
sharp
contact
with
anything
none
of
her
uncles
she
further
reflected
liked
sharp
contacts
and
yet
how
continually
grandmother
provided
them
how
comfortable
all
of
them
aunt
adela
and
the
uncles
would
be
without
their
mother
and
yet
how
proud
they
were
of
having
her
for
herself
rachel
faced
her
approaching
deliverance
with
a
tightening
of
all
the
muscles
of
her
body
i
wo
care
it
shall
be
as
may
says
and
there
are
sure
to
be
some
comfortable
people
about
some
people
who
want
to
make
it
pleasant
for
one
then
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
uncle
john
came
in
uncle
john
often
came
in
about
five
it
was
a
convenient
time
for
him
to
come
but
also
perhaps
he
recognized
that
that
approaching
that
rachel
was
to
have
with
his
mother
demanded
beforehand
some
kind
of
easy
amiable
prologue
however
there
was
more
in
his
comfortable
smiling
countenance
than
merely
paying
a
visit
warranted
he
stood
for
a
moment
at
the
door
looking
over
at
her
rather
fat
but
not
very
his
white
hair
his
pearl
pin
his
white
spats
all
gleaming
a
rosiness
and
a
cleanliness
always
about
him
so
that
he
seemed
at
any
moment
of
the
day
to
have
come
straight
from
his
tub
having
jumped
in
his
eagerness
to
see
you
into
his
beautiful
clothes
and
hurried
all
in
a
glow
to
get
to
you
they
all
chattering
downstairs
chattering
like
anything
roddy
seddon
old
lady
carloes
and
crewner
and
some
young
ass
brought
with
him
and
your
uncle
dick
looking
bored
and
your
aunt
adela
looking
nothing
at
all
and
so
out
of
it
i
came
he
came
over
and
sat
on
the
broad
fat
arm
of
her
chair
and
looked
out
in
his
contented
amiable
way
over
the
light
and
pale
that
now
had
persuaded
portland
place
into
silence
his
eyes
seemed
to
say
now
this
is
how
i
like
things
all
pink
and
quiet
and
comfortable
rachel
leant
a
little
against
his
shoulder
and
put
her
hand
on
his
knee
you
had
tea
down
there
yes
thank
you
all
i
wanted
what
have
you
been
doing
all
the
afternoon
he
put
his
own
hand
down
upon
hers
oh
aunt
adela
and
i
went
to
look
at
grandmother
portrait
well
it
as
clever
as
it
can
be
to
anyone
who
does
know
her
it
the
most
wonderful
likeness
it
what
grandmother
would
like
herself
he
caught
the
note
in
her
voice
that
threatened
the
pink
security
of
portland
place
he
held
her
hand
a
little
tighter
in
what
way
oh
it
got
the
dragons
and
the
tapestry
and
the
purple
carpet
all
the
coloured
things
that
grandmother
like
so
much
and
that
help
her
so
why
imagine
her
for
a
second
in
an
ordinary
room
in
an
old
with
a
carpet
and
everlastings
on
the
mantelpiece
what
she
do
the
young
man
whoever
he
is
has
helped
her
all
he
can
rachel
felt
his
grasp
of
her
hand
slacken
a
little
yes
i
know
it
wrong
of
me
to
talk
like
that
but
it
all
so
sham
it
like
someone
in
one
of
those
absurd
fantastic
novels
that
people
write
nowadays
when
half
the
characters
are
out
of
dickens
only
put
into
a
real
background
i
frightened
of
grandmother
you
know
i
always
have
been
but
sometimes
i
wonder
whether
she
paused
whether
there
anything
really
to
be
frightened
of
and
yet
the
relief
when
i
can
get
off
this
every
evening
the
relief
even
now
when
i
even
grown
up
oh
it
absurd
well
my
dear
you
coming
out
you
going
to
break
away
from
all
of
us
you
have
your
own
life
now
to
make
what
you
like
of
yes
that
all
very
well
but
i
been
brought
up
all
wrong
most
girls
begin
to
come
out
when
they
about
ten
and
go
on
more
and
more
until
when
the
time
actually
comes
well
there
simply
nothing
in
it
i
never
known
anyone
intimately
except
may
and
now
at
the
thought
of
crowds
and
crowds
of
people
at
one
moment
i
like
to
fly
into
a
convent
somewhere
and
at
the
next
i
want
to
go
and
be
rude
to
the
lot
of
them
to
get
in
quickly
you
know
lest
they
should
be
rude
to
me
first
now
that
she
had
begun
it
came
out
in
a
flood
oh
i
shall
make
such
a
mess
of
it
all
what
on
earth
am
i
to
talk
about
to
these
people
what
do
they
want
with
me
or
i
with
them
what
have
i
ever
to
say
to
anybody
except
you
and
chris
and
even
with
you
i
as
cross
as
possible
most
of
the
time
grandmother
always
thought
me
a
complete
fool
and
so
i
suppose
i
am
if
people
are
kind
i
ca
say
a
word
and
if
they
are
i
say
far
too
much
and
blush
afterwards
for
all
the
nonsense
poured
out
it
does
matter
with
you
and
chris
because
you
know
me
but
the
others
and
always
behind
me
there
be
grandmother
she
knows
i
going
to
be
a
failure
and
she
wants
me
to
be
but
just
to
prove
to
her
just
to
prove
she
jumped
up
and
standing
in
front
of
the
window
met
furiously
a
hostile
world
her
hands
were
clenched
her
face
white
her
eyes
just
to
prove
i
be
a
success
i
marry
the
most
magnificent
husband
i
be
the
most
magnificent
person
i
bring
it
off
suddenly
her
agitation
was
gone
she
was
laughing
looking
down
on
her
uncle
half
humorously
half
tenderly
just
because
i
love
you
and
chris
i
do
my
best
not
to
shame
you
i
be
the
most
decorous
and
amiable
of
no
one
shall
have
a
word
to
say
she
bent
down
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
then
she
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
with
her
hands
clasped
over
his
knee
uncle
john
would
not
have
loved
her
so
dearly
had
he
not
been
on
so
many
occasions
frightened
of
her
she
was
often
hostile
in
the
most
curious
way
so
militant
that
he
could
only
console
himself
by
thinking
that
her
mother
had
been
russian
and
from
russia
one
might
expect
anything
and
then
in
a
moment
the
hostility
would
break
into
a
tenderness
an
affection
that
touched
him
to
the
heart
and
made
the
tears
come
into
his
eyes
but
for
one
who
loved
comfort
above
everything
rachel
was
an
agitating
person
now
as
he
felt
the
pressure
of
her
hands
on
his
knees
he
knew
that
he
would
do
anything
anything
for
her
that
all
right
rachel
dear
was
all
that
he
could
say
you
hold
on
to
me
and
christopher
we
see
you
through
the
little
silver
clock
struck
six
she
got
up
from
the
chair
and
smiled
down
at
him
if
i
had
got
you
and
chris
well
i
just
know
what
would
happen
to
me
meanwhile
uncle
john
had
remembered
what
it
was
that
he
had
come
to
say
his
expression
was
now
one
of
puzzled
distress
as
though
he
wondered
how
people
could
be
so
provoking
and
inconsiderate
he
looked
up
at
her
by
the
way
he
said
it
doubtful
whether
mother
will
see
you
this
evening
you
better
go
and
ask
but
i
expect
what
happened
i
may
as
well
tell
you
you
bound
to
hear
sooner
or
later
your
cousin
francis
is
back
in
london
he
written
a
most
insulting
letter
to
your
grandmother
it
upset
her
very
much
cousin
frank
yes
he
living
apparently
quite
near
here
in
some
cheap
rooms
may
eversley
had
long
before
supplied
rachel
with
all
details
as
to
that
family
scandal
rachel
now
only
said
well
i
go
and
see
whether
she
would
like
me
to
come
for
a
moment
she
hesitated
then
turned
back
and
flung
her
arms
again
about
her
uncle
neck
whatever
happens
uncle
john
whatever
happens
we
stick
together
whatever
happens
he
repeated
we
stick
together
his
eyes
as
they
followed
her
were
full
of
tenderness
but
behind
the
tenderness
there
lurked
a
shadow
of
alarm
chapter
iii
lady
adela
at
first
it
seemed
a
little
speck
and
then
it
seemed
a
mist
it
moved
and
moved
and
took
at
last
a
certain
shape
i
wist
ancient
i
lady
adela
had
returned
from
that
visit
to
her
mother
portrait
with
a
confused
mind
she
was
not
used
to
confused
minds
and
resented
them
whenever
so
great
an
infliction
came
upon
her
she
solved
the
confusion
by
dismissing
it
by
leaving
her
mind
a
blank
until
it
should
take
upon
itself
to
be
clear
again
to
obtain
that
blank
an
interval
of
reflection
was
necessary
and
now
that
had
been
impossible
on
returning
she
had
been
instantly
confronted
by
a
number
of
people
who
required
to
be
given
tea
and
conversation
and
no
time
had
been
allowed
her
in
which
she
might
resolve
that
her
mind
should
be
cleared
her
confusion
was
that
the
portrait
of
her
mother
was
precisely
like
a
most
brilliant
affair
and
yet
was
like
in
the
least
further
than
that
in
some
completely
muddled
way
it
was
in
the
back
of
her
mind
that
her
mother
suddenly
this
afternoon
presented
herself
to
her
as
not
entirely
living
up
to
the
portrait
as
being
less
sharp
less
terrible
less
magnificent
horror
lest
she
should
in
any
way
be
doubting
her
mother
terror
and
magnificence
both
proved
every
day
of
the
week
lay
like
a
dark
cloud
at
the
back
of
her
confusion
she
could
not
however
extract
anything
definite
from
the
little
cluster
of
discomforts
old
lady
carloes
and
lord
crewner
a
young
thing
that
lord
crewner
had
brought
with
him
and
her
brother
richard
were
all
waiting
for
tea
and
floods
of
conversation
instantly
covered
lady
adela
poor
mind
and
drowned
it
the
long
where
they
now
were
was
long
and
narrow
with
two
large
open
fireplaces
a
great
deal
of
old
furniture
rather
faded
and
very
handsome
silver
that
gleamed
against
the
dark
one
big
portrait
of
the
duchess
painted
by
sargent
twenty
years
ago
and
high
windows
shut
off
now
by
heavy
dark
green
curtains
the
duchess
it
was
understood
did
not
approve
of
electric
light
and
the
house
therefore
disdained
it
parts
of
the
room
were
lighted
by
candles
placed
in
heavy
old
silver
candlesticks
round
the
fireplace
at
the
farther
end
of
the
light
shone
and
glittered
there
the
stood
and
round
about
them
the
company
was
gathered
the
rest
of
the
room
hung
in
dark
shadow
stretched
into
black
depths
lit
only
now
and
again
by
the
gleam
of
silver
or
glass
as
the
light
of
the
more
distant
fire
flashed
and
fell
the
voices
the
clatter
of
the
these
sounds
seemed
to
be
echoed
by
the
darker
depths
of
the
farther
stretches
of
the
room
lady
carlos
was
eighty
extremely
vigorous
and
believed
in
bright
colours
she
was
dressed
now
in
purple
and
wore
a
hat
with
a
large
white
feather
her
figure
was
bunched
into
a
kind
of
bundle
so
that
her
waist
was
too
near
her
bosom
and
her
bosom
too
near
her
chin
and
her
chin
too
near
her
forehead
it
was
as
though
some
spiteful
person
had
pressed
all
of
her
too
closely
together
but
this
very
shapelessness
added
to
her
undoubted
amiability
her
face
was
fat
and
smiling
her
hair
white
and
untidy
and
she
maintained
her
dignity
in
spite
of
her
figure
nobody
knew
anything
with
certainty
as
to
her
income
but
she
was
charitable
and
ran
a
little
house
in
charles
street
with
a
great
deal
of
ceremony
and
hospitality
her
husband
had
long
been
dead
and
her
two
daughters
had
long
been
married
so
that
she
was
happy
and
independent
many
people
considered
her
tiresome
because
her
curiosity
was
insatiable
and
her
discretion
open
to
question
yet
she
was
a
staunch
beaminster
adherent
an
old
friend
of
the
duchess
and
saw
both
this
world
and
the
next
in
the
proper
beaminster
light
lady
adela
depended
on
her
a
good
deal
at
certain
times
she
had
forseen
that
the
old
lady
would
come
she
had
heard
of
course
of
frank
breton
arrival
in
town
she
would
demand
every
detail
lady
adela
knew
that
the
account
that
she
gave
to
lady
carloes
would
be
the
account
that
the
town
would
receive
by
the
fire
lord
richard
lord
crewner
and
the
nondescript
young
man
were
talking
together
lady
adela
caught
fragments
but
of
course
dilchester
is
incautious
when
was
he
anything
else
what
these
fellows
need
that
was
her
brother
and
then
lord
crewner
who
believed
that
the
windows
of
white
and
brook
were
the
only
courts
of
ultimate
judgment
that
all
very
well
beaminster
but
i
assure
you
they
were
saying
last
night
at
the
club
as
far
as
all
that
was
concerned
lady
adela
flung
it
aside
she
must
attend
to
lady
carloes
she
must
give
to
her
the
version
of
frank
breton
arrival
that
her
mother
would
wish
her
to
give
but
what
that
version
and
her
mother
really
to
be
depended
upon
at
so
terrible
a
flash
of
disloyalty
lady
adela
why
were
things
so
difficult
this
afternoon
and
why
had
she
ever
gone
to
that
lady
carloes
had
however
not
yet
arrived
at
frank
breton
she
never
paid
a
visit
anywhere
without
tabulating
carefully
in
her
mind
the
things
that
she
must
know
before
leaving
the
house
her
theory
was
that
she
was
really
very
old
indeed
and
could
possibly
live
much
longer
and
that
no
moment
therefore
must
be
wasted
the
more
news
that
she
could
give
and
receive
before
her
ultimate
departure
the
more
value
would
her
life
have
in
retrospect
she
never
went
definitely
into
the
exact
worth
that
all
the
gossip
that
she
collected
might
have
for
anybody
or
anything
as
with
any
other
collection
it
was
pursuit
rather
than
acquisition
that
fired
the
blood
at
the
back
of
her
old
mind
was
a
perfect
of
muddle
and
confusion
dusty
gossip
cobwebs
of
scandal
windows
thick
with
grime
and
tightly
closed
there
was
no
time
left
now
to
do
anything
to
that
meanwhile
every
day
something
was
purchased
or
exchanged
muddle
there
might
be
but
thank
god
nobody
knew
it
you
must
be
very
busy
about
the
ball
my
dear
yes
it
means
a
great
deal
of
work
it
so
long
since
we
had
anything
here
but
norris
is
invaluable
you
do
find
servants
like
that
nowadays
no
my
dear
you
do
but
of
course
it
will
go
off
splendidly
we
all
so
anxious
that
rachel
shall
have
a
good
time
it
the
least
we
can
do
for
your
mother
at
the
mention
of
rachel
lady
adela
thoughts
straightened
for
a
second
was
where
the
confusion
lay
it
had
been
attitude
to
the
portrait
that
had
caused
lady
adela
own
momentary
disloyalty
of
course
rachel
hated
her
grandmother
lady
adela
made
a
little
sound
with
her
fingers
a
sound
like
the
clicking
of
needles
as
far
as
rachel
is
concerned
nobody
can
tell
possibly
how
she
going
to
take
it
all
i
do
pretend
to
understand
her
lady
carloes
found
this
interesting
she
bent
forward
a
little
all
greatly
excited
about
her
you
kept
her
away
from
all
of
us
and
one
hears
such
different
accounts
of
her
and
of
course
her
success
is
most
important
as
things
are
just
now
lady
adela
answered
i
can
tell
you
nothing
she
is
in
the
least
like
any
of
us
and
i
do
suppose
for
a
moment
that
she
listen
to
anybody
she
made
a
friend
of
may
eversley
in
munich
and
i
do
think
that
was
the
best
thing
for
her
but
you
know
i
talked
about
this
to
you
before
not
only
had
lady
adela
talked
all
of
them
had
done
so
in
the
beaminster
camp
this
appearance
that
rachel
was
about
to
make
was
of
the
last
importance
there
were
enemies
redoubtable
enemies
in
the
field
rachel
beaminster
bow
to
the
world
was
for
the
very
reason
that
all
the
world
was
watching
a
responsibility
for
them
all
but
there
were
many
rumours
rachel
was
not
to
be
relied
upon
she
hated
her
grandmother
she
was
strange
and
foreign
and
morose
lady
carloes
was
not
happy
about
it
and
lady
adela
attitude
now
was
anything
but
reassuring
john
beaminster
came
in
lady
carloes
liked
him
because
he
was
and
injudicious
he
told
her
a
number
of
things
that
nobody
else
ever
told
her
and
he
had
so
simple
a
mind
that
extracting
news
from
it
was
as
easy
as
taking
plums
from
a
pudding
he
did
not
come
over
to
them
at
once
but
stood
laughing
with
lord
crewner
and
his
brother
he
would
come
however
in
a
moment
so
lady
carloes
made
a
last
hurried
plunge
at
her
friend
what
this
i
hear
my
dear
about
frank
breton
yes
it
perfectly
true
he
come
back
and
has
taken
rooms
quite
near
here
he
wrote
to
mother
lady
carloes
took
this
in
with
a
gulp
of
delight
my
dear
adela
what
did
he
say
oh
a
very
rude
letter
he
told
mother
that
he
knew
that
she
would
like
him
to
be
near
at
hand
and
that
they
ought
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
that
he
was
sure
that
she
would
be
glad
to
hear
that
he
was
a
reformed
character
of
course
he
hates
all
of
us
what
will
you
all
do
oh
nothing
of
course
we
gave
him
up
long
ago
by
a
tiresome
coincidence
he
taken
rooms
in
the
same
house
as
my
secretary
miss
rand
i
would
send
her
away
if
she
were
simply
invaluable
but
it
gives
him
a
kind
of
a
link
with
us
monty
carfax
saw
him
yesterday
he
lost
his
left
arm
monty
says
and
looks
more
of
an
adventurer
than
ever
so
tiresome
for
your
mother
my
dear
then
as
lord
john
began
to
break
away
from
the
group
at
the
fireplace
and
move
towards
them
roddy
seddon
told
me
he
might
look
in
this
afternoon
your
so
devoted
to
him
he
seems
to
understand
her
so
well
the
two
ladies
faced
one
another
their
eyes
crossed
lady
carloes
murmured
such
a
splendid
fellow
then
as
lord
john
cheerful
laugh
broke
upon
them
is
rachel
coming
down
she
asked
ii
lady
adela
left
her
brother
and
lady
carloes
together
and
crossed
over
to
the
group
at
the
fireplace
of
all
her
brothers
she
liked
richard
best
he
seemed
to
her
to
be
precisely
all
that
a
beaminster
should
be
she
liked
his
appearance
his
fine
domed
forehead
his
grey
hair
his
long
rather
melancholy
face
his
austere
and
orderly
figure
he
had
to
perfection
that
reserve
that
kind
benignancy
that
a
beaminster
ought
to
have
whenever
lady
adela
questioned
the
foundations
upon
which
the
stability
of
her
life
depended
he
reassured
her
without
saying
anything
at
all
he
gravely
comforted
her
that
is
what
a
beaminster
ought
to
do
she
knew
as
she
saw
him
standing
there
by
the
fire
that
would
never
doubt
his
mother
to
him
she
would
always
be
splendid
and
magnificent
and
with
what
determination
would
he
expel
from
him
any
base
attacks
on
that
loyalty
lady
adela
thought
that
power
to
expel
resolutely
and
firmly
everything
that
attacked
the
settled
assurance
of
one
mind
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
lord
crewner
was
a
thin
handsome
man
of
any
age
at
all
over
forty
and
under
sixty
he
was
polished
and
brushed
and
scrubbed
to
such
an
extent
that
he
looked
like
an
advertisement
of
some
fine
old
english
firm
that
produced
at
great
cost
and
with
wonderful
completeness
fine
old
english
gentlemen
he
believed
in
not
thinking
about
things
very
much
because
thinking
let
in
radicals
and
diseases
and
the
poor
and
made
one
uncomfortable
he
loved
the
london
that
he
knew
a
london
bounded
by
sloane
square
the
marble
arch
trafalgar
square
and
westminster
he
was
a
bachelor
but
might
have
married
lady
adela
had
the
duchess
not
refused
to
hear
of
lady
adela
leaving
her
he
adored
the
duchess
although
he
was
scarcely
ever
allowed
to
see
her
because
he
bored
her
he
always
lowered
his
voice
a
little
when
talking
to
women
and
heightened
it
a
little
when
talking
to
men
to
his
valet
he
spoke
in
the
voice
that
nature
had
given
him
lady
adela
was
reassured
as
she
came
towards
them
although
she
did
not
especially
desire
to
marry
lord
crewner
the
thought
that
he
might
had
affairs
been
differently
arranged
have
asked
her
placed
him
in
her
eyes
apart
from
other
men
at
any
rate
these
two
were
comfortable
to
her
and
for
a
moment
she
was
able
to
dismiss
rachel
and
frank
breton
from
her
mind
they
talked
easily
beside
the
fireplace
the
voices
of
lady
carloes
and
lord
john
the
pleasant
murmur
of
the
fire
the
ticking
clocks
all
helped
that
lazy
swaying
of
time
and
space
about
one
that
happy
reassurance
that
as
the
world
had
been
so
would
it
continue
ever
to
be
and
that
the
old
emotions
and
the
old
experiences
and
the
old
opinions
would
always
hold
their
own
against
all
invasion
and
decay
lord
richard
talked
of
chippendale
and
some
wonderful
lowestoft
lord
crewner
talked
of
madeira
and
lady
masters
new
house
lady
adela
listened
and
was
soothed
upon
them
all
broke
a
voice
sir
roderick
seddon
my
lady
there
stood
in
the
doorway
the
freshest
the
most
beaming
of
young
men
he
was
tall
and
broad
his
face
was
of
a
colour
and
his
dark
london
clothes
although
they
were
well
cut
and
handsome
enough
were
obviously
only
worn
to
please
a
necessary
convention
his
hair
was
light
brown
and
cut
close
to
his
head
and
his
body
had
the
healthy
sturdiness
of
someone
whose
every
muscle
was
in
proper
training
he
came
forward
to
the
group
at
the
fireplace
with
the
walk
of
a
man
accustomed
to
space
and
air
and
freedom
his
smiling
face
was
so
genial
and
that
the
whole
room
seemed
to
break
away
a
little
from
its
decorous
and
shining
propriety
they
were
all
pleased
to
see
him
lady
carloes
and
lord
john
came
over
and
joined
the
group
and
they
stood
all
about
him
talking
and
laughing
roddy
seddon
was
the
only
young
man
whom
the
duchess
permitted
and
people
said
that
that
was
because
he
was
the
only
young
man
who
had
never
shown
any
fear
of
her
the
knowledge
of
this
fact
gave
him
in
lady
adela
eyes
a
curious
interest
she
beheld
him
always
rather
as
she
would
have
beheld
anyone
who
had
learnt
an
abstruse
language
that
no
one
else
had
ever
mastered
or
some
traveller
who
was
reputed
to
have
said
or
done
the
most
extraordinary
things
in
some
savage
country
how
he
what
talisman
had
he
discovered
that
protected
him
and
then
swiftly
on
that
came
the
curious
thought
that
she
herself
was
glad
that
she
had
her
terror
that
she
was
proud
in
some
strange
inverted
way
that
any
beaminster
could
have
the
effect
upon
anyone
that
her
mother
had
upon
her
but
roddy
seddon
had
another
especial
interest
for
her
for
it
was
roddy
all
the
beaminsters
had
decided
who
was
to
marry
rachel
roddy
was
in
every
way
the
right
person
not
very
wealthy
perhaps
but
he
had
one
nice
place
in
sussex
and
rachel
would
not
herself
be
a
pauper
roddy
would
never
let
the
beaminsters
down
he
hated
all
these
new
invaders
as
strongly
as
any
beaminster
could
he
hated
this
mixing
of
the
classes
this
perpetual
urging
of
the
working
man
to
think
lots
of
our
fellows
lady
adela
had
heard
him
say
get
along
without
thinkin
why
not
the
other
fellers
she
felt
now
that
a
conversation
with
roddy
would
complete
the
soothing
process
that
lord
crewner
and
her
brother
had
begun
he
would
finally
reassure
her
she
had
no
difficulty
in
securing
him
lady
carloes
sat
by
the
fire
and
talked
to
lord
crewner
and
the
nondescript
and
the
two
brothers
departed
when
roddy
had
drunk
his
tea
she
led
him
away
to
the
farther
part
of
the
long
dim
room
and
there
by
that
more
distant
fireplace
the
two
of
them
sat
shadowy
against
the
leaping
light
their
faces
and
their
hands
white
and
sharp
and
definite
who
else
is
dinin
on
thursday
she
gave
him
names
the
prince
and
princess
are
coming
you
know
but
they
are
alarming
they
been
often
to
see
mother
when
they
been
over
here
before
they
getting
old
enough
now
to
be
comfortable
he
dances
like
anything
still
i
always
like
dinin
in
the
place
you
dancin
at
you
do
get
that
shivery
feeling
comin
up
the
stairs
and
puttin
your
gloves
on
one
up
on
the
others
if
you
been
dinin
lady
adela
looked
at
him
and
sighed
a
little
impatiently
he
was
incredibly
young
and
might
after
all
let
them
down
he
was
thirty
now
but
he
looked
not
a
day
more
than
nineteen
and
he
always
talked
and
behaved
as
though
he
were
still
in
his
last
year
at
eton
she
opposed
him
in
her
mind
eye
to
that
figure
of
frank
breton
that
had
been
before
her
all
day
how
could
a
mere
boy
stand
up
against
a
scoundrel
like
that
moreover
she
had
heard
stories
about
roddy
women
had
terrible
power
over
him
she
had
been
told
and
then
with
a
glance
at
him
sighed
again
at
the
thought
that
her
own
time
had
gone
by
for
having
power
over
anybody
even
lord
crewner
well
after
all
her
mother
knew
the
boy
better
than
anyone
did
and
her
mother
loved
him
better
than
everyone
else
put
together
her
mother
loved
him
how
rachel
takin
it
how
does
rachel
take
anything
she
never
says
anything
and
one
never
knows
she
seems
to
have
no
curiosity
or
eagerness
i
was
talkin
to
may
eversley
about
her
the
other
night
may
says
she
be
splendid
i
do
like
may
eversley
lady
adela
nervously
moved
her
hands
on
her
lap
i
wish
rachel
had
made
such
friends
with
her
in
munich
oh
may
all
right
roddy
blue
eyes
were
smiling
took
her
down
to
hurlingham
yesterday
and
we
had
no
end
of
a
time
it
was
a
pity
lady
adela
reflected
that
roddy
was
so
absolutely
on
his
own
his
mother
had
died
at
his
birth
and
his
father
had
been
dead
for
five
years
now
and
here
it
seemed
to
lady
adela
a
curious
coincidence
that
both
rachel
and
roddy
were
orphans
and
both
so
young
she
leant
forward
towards
him
you
can
do
a
lot
for
rachel
roddy
you
can
help
her
to
understand
her
grandmother
you
can
reconcile
her
to
all
of
us
oh
i
say
roddy
laughed
perhaps
she
wo
have
anythin
to
say
to
me
you
know
my
seein
your
mother
so
often
is
quite
enough
no
she
likes
cheerful
people
christopher
and
john
you
in
the
same
line
of
country
roddy
she
does
like
me
and
i
have
got
the
things
in
me
to
draw
affection
out
of
her
i
not
that
kind
of
woman
as
a
rule
lady
adela
betrayed
no
emotion
of
any
kind
but
now
this
afternoon
both
to
lady
carloes
and
roddy
she
had
made
some
vague
indefinite
appeal
perhaps
the
news
of
breton
arrival
had
alarmed
her
perhaps
her
visit
to
the
gallery
with
rachel
had
really
disturbed
her
she
seemed
to
beg
for
assistance
roddy
analysed
neither
his
own
emotions
nor
those
of
his
friends
but
this
afternoon
lady
adela
did
appear
to
him
a
little
more
human
than
before
he
was
suddenly
sorry
for
her
rachel
be
all
right
he
assured
her
wait
a
bit
by
the
way
i
met
that
little
feller
brun
yesterday
said
he
was
comin
on
thursday
wild
about
your
mother
picture
yes
we
saw
him
at
the
gallery
this
afternoon
rachel
and
i
were
there
rachel
what
did
she
think
of
it
seemed
to
take
no
interest
in
it
at
all
we
were
there
only
a
few
minutes
silence
fell
between
them
a
silence
filled
with
meaning
lady
adela
had
intended
to
speak
about
breton
now
suddenly
she
could
say
nothing
the
mention
of
the
had
brought
back
all
her
earlier
discomfort
she
saw
the
picture
the
eyes
the
nose
the
mouth
the
white
pinched
cheeks
then
she
saw
the
great
bedroom
upstairs
the
high
white
bed
the
little
shrivelled
figure
had
rachel
pointed
this
contrast
had
breton
was
it
something
that
roddy
had
discovered
already
something
that
had
made
his
courage
so
easy
for
him
what
what
was
going
to
be
done
with
her
if
she
were
no
longer
afraid
why
on
that
terror
on
that
trembling
service
were
built
the
foundations
of
all
her
life
how
could
she
face
that
picture
that
the
world
had
of
a
splendid
historic
dominating
figure
if
she
herself
saw
only
a
sick
miserable
old
woman
tumbling
to
pieces
passing
to
decay
the
minutes
had
passed
and
she
had
said
nothing
roddy
must
be
wondering
at
her
silence
to
her
relief
lady
carloes
came
towards
her
to
say
roddy
eyes
were
puzzled
for
what
had
she
carried
him
off
if
she
had
nothing
to
say
to
him
iii
when
they
were
all
gone
she
went
up
to
her
mother
before
the
door
she
paused
the
house
was
very
still
and
her
heart
was
furiously
beating
she
opened
the
door
and
at
the
sight
of
the
room
was
instantly
reassured
dorchester
met
her
her
grace
went
to
bed
early
but
she
will
see
you
my
lady
lady
adela
stepped
softly
to
the
farther
door
all
was
well
about
her
around
her
within
her
was
that
same
splendid
terror
that
same
knowledge
that
she
was
approaching
some
great
presence
that
had
been
with
her
all
her
life
as
she
opened
the
bedroom
door
and
saw
the
high
white
bed
she
knew
that
her
mother
was
more
magnificent
more
wonderful
than
any
painted
picture
could
possibly
make
her
chapter
iv
the
pool
i
on
that
same
afternoon
in
another
part
of
the
house
miss
rand
lady
adela
secretary
finished
her
work
for
the
day
and
prepared
to
go
home
it
was
about
a
six
and
the
may
evening
was
sending
through
the
windows
its
pale
glow
suggesting
soft
blue
skies
and
fading
lights
miss
rand
room
told
you
at
once
everything
about
miss
rand
for
efficiency
and
neatness
for
discipline
and
restraint
it
could
not
be
beaten
miss
rand
herself
was
all
these
things
efficient
and
neat
disciplined
and
restrained
her
room
had
against
one
white
and
shining
wall
a
black
and
shining
typewriter
against
another
wall
was
a
table
and
on
this
table
were
so
many
contrivances
for
keeping
letters
and
papers
decent
and
docketed
that
it
made
every
other
table
the
observer
could
remember
seem
untidy
and
littered
there
was
nothing
in
the
room
superfluous
or
unnecessary
and
even
some
carnations
in
a
green
bowl
near
the
window
looked
as
though
they
were
numbered
and
ticketed
miss
rand
was
a
little
woman
who
appeared
when
she
was
busy
and
when
someone
was
pleasant
to
her
when
she
was
at
work
the
broad
dark
belt
that
she
wore
at
her
waist
was
her
most
characteristic
feature
then
in
keeping
with
this
was
her
dark
hair
beautiful
hair
perhaps
if
it
had
been
allowed
some
freedom
but
now
ordered
and
sternly
disciplined
she
wore
no
ornaments
and
about
her
there
was
nothing
out
of
place
nor
extravagant
her
face
was
full
of
light
and
colour
and
her
eyes
were
beautiful
but
no
one
considered
them
it
was
impossible
to
look
beyond
that
stern
shining
belt
one
felt
that
miss
rand
herself
would
resent
appreciation
from
ten
in
the
morning
until
five
in
the
evening
the
huge
portland
place
house
absorbed
her
energies
she
saw
it
sometimes
in
her
dreams
as
a
great
unwieldy
machine
kept
in
place
by
her
hand
but
leaping
did
she
leave
it
for
an
instant
trembling
soaring
carrying
destruction
with
it
into
the
heart
of
the
city
meanwhile
her
hand
was
upon
it
from
norris
the
butler
from
dorchester
the
guardian
of
the
duchess
apartments
down
to
the
smallest
most
insignificant
miss
rand
knew
them
all
there
was
of
course
newton
the
most
splendid
and
elevating
of
housekeepers
but
when
matters
below
stairs
went
beyond
her
control
miss
rand
could
always
arrange
them
there
was
nothing
absolutely
nothing
that
in
the
way
of
managing
her
miss
rand
could
not
do
but
it
was
because
miss
rand
never
occurred
to
any
single
creature
in
the
portland
place
house
as
a
sentient
breathing
human
being
that
she
succeeded
as
she
did
she
had
no
prejudices
no
angers
no
rebellions
no
rejoicings
she
was
the
little
engine
at
the
heart
of
the
house
that
sent
everything
into
motion
one
ca
imagine
her
eating
her
meals
newton
norris
once
said
and
as
to
her
sleeping
like
you
or
me
to
see
her
now
as
she
put
the
final
touches
to
her
room
before
leaving
it
arranging
a
paper
here
and
a
paper
there
going
to
the
bookshelf
and
pushing
back
a
book
that
jutted
in
front
of
the
others
setting
a
chair
against
the
wall
placing
the
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
table
finally
taking
her
hat
and
coat
and
putting
them
on
with
the
same
careful
and
almost
automatic
distinction
this
sufficiently
revealed
her
she
seemed
as
she
looked
for
the
last
time
about
the
room
with
her
bright
eyes
like
some
sharp
little
bird
perched
on
a
looking
beyond
closed
windows
for
new
adventure
it
was
one
of
the
striking
points
in
her
that
her
eyes
always
seemed
to
be
searching
for
some
disorder
in
some
place
outside
her
immediate
vision
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
as
she
stepped
into
the
passage
someone
was
coming
down
the
staircase
to
her
right
and
looking
up
she
saw
that
it
was
rachel
beaminster
rachel
was
on
her
way
from
her
room
and
before
she
saw
miss
rand
standing
there
waiting
to
let
her
pass
her
face
was
grave
and
in
that
strangely
white
then
as
she
saw
miss
rand
she
smiled
good
evening
miss
rand
good
evening
miss
beaminster
i
afraid
that
this
ball
is
giving
you
a
lot
of
trouble
i
think
that
everything
is
arranged
now
miss
beaminster
i
hope
that
it
will
be
a
great
success
rachel
sighed
and
then
laughed
do
i
wish
the
whole
stupid
thing
was
over
and
i
expect
you
do
too
miss
rand
smiled
a
very
little
it
good
for
the
servants
she
said
they
always
happy
when
they
really
busy
for
a
moment
they
stood
there
smiling
it
occurred
to
rachel
that
miss
rand
must
be
rather
nice
she
had
never
thought
of
her
before
as
anything
but
aunt
adela
secretary
good
night
miss
rand
good
night
miss
beaminster
ii
in
portland
place
miss
rand
drew
a
little
breath
and
paused
so
many
times
during
the
last
five
years
had
she
walked
from
portland
place
to
saxton
square
and
from
saxton
square
to
portland
place
that
the
streets
and
houses
encountered
by
her
had
become
individual
alive
always
offering
to
her
some
fresh
adventure
or
romance
portland
place
itself
was
no
bad
beginning
with
its
high
white
colour
its
air
and
its
dark
mysterious
park
hovering
at
the
edge
of
it
if
one
had
not
known
miss
rand
thought
one
might
have
supposed
that
just
beyond
it
lay
the
sea
so
fresh
and
full
of
breezes
was
the
air
the
light
was
yellow
now
and
the
houses
black
and
sharp
against
the
faint
sky
in
another
the
lamps
would
be
lit
it
was
pleasant
and
fitting
that
the
end
of
portland
place
should
be
guarded
by
the
round
church
and
the
queen
hall
leave
that
calm
and
chaste
society
behind
you
those
places
said
but
before
you
plunge
into
the
wicked
careless
world
that
is
oxford
circus
choose
from
us
here
you
have
religion
or
music
both
if
you
will
but
here
at
any
rate
we
are
the
very
best
of
our
kind
the
queen
hall
looked
shabby
in
the
evening
light
but
miss
rand
liked
that
it
heightened
her
sense
of
the
splendour
within
beethoven
and
wagner
and
brahms
needed
no
illumination
it
was
your
musical
comedy
demanded
that
miss
rand
liked
good
music
then
there
was
the
polytechnic
with
wonderful
offers
in
the
windows
enticing
you
to
see
rome
for
eleven
guineas
and
paris
for
three
and
there
was
a
hat
shop
with
three
glorious
hats
wickedly
dangling
on
poles
and
there
was
a
a
tobacconist
and
a
theatre
agency
all
this
variety
paving
the
way
between
music
and
religion
and
the
whirling
tossing
heaving
melodrama
of
oxford
circus
miss
rand
loved
oxford
circus
it
was
like
the
sea
in
that
it
was
never
from
one
moment
to
another
the
same
miss
rand
knew
the
way
that
it
had
of
piling
the
melodrama
up
and
up
faster
and
faster
wilder
and
wilder
bursting
into
a
frantio
climax
and
then
sinking
back
for
hours
perhaps
into
comparative
silence
she
knew
all
its
moods
from
its
broom
and
milkman
mood
in
the
early
morning
to
its
soiled
and
slinking
mood
somewhere
between
midnight
and
one
just
now
it
was
getting
ready
for
the
evening
up
regent
street
the
cabs
and
buses
were
straining
the
flower
women
with
their
baskets
were
bunched
in
splashes
of
colour
against
the
distant
outline
of
the
round
church
out
of
every
door
people
were
pouring
and
in
the
middle
of
the
circus
three
of
the
four
lines
of
traffic
were
turned
suddenly
into
something
sleepy
and
indifferent
by
the
hand
of
a
policeman
for
an
instant
the
restless
movement
seemed
to
be
crystallized
the
hansoms
the
bicycles
the
omnibuses
the
carts
were
all
held
then
at
a
sign
the
flow
and
interflow
had
begun
once
more
life
was
hurled
in
and
hurled
out
again
stirred
and
tossed
and
turned
as
though
some
giant
cook
were
up
in
the
heavens
busy
over
a
giant
pudding
and
the
light
faded
and
the
lamps
came
out
and
miss
rand
walking
through
two
streets
that
were
as
dark
and
secret
as
though
they
were
spying
on
the
circus
and
were
going
to
give
all
its
secrets
away
very
shortly
passed
into
saxton
square
miss
rand
had
more
to
think
about
than
oxford
circus
she
was
tired
after
all
the
work
that
there
had
been
during
the
last
few
days
and
she
always
noticed
that
it
was
when
she
was
tired
that
she
was
ready
to
imagine
things
she
had
been
imagining
things
all
day
and
had
found
it
really
difficult
to
keep
steadily
to
her
proper
work
but
out
and
beyond
her
imaginations
there
was
before
her
this
definite
tremendous
fact
namely
that
she
would
find
this
evening
on
entering
her
little
that
francis
breton
was
being
entertained
at
tea
by
her
sister
and
mother
it
was
a
quarter
to
seven
now
so
perhaps
he
had
gone
but
at
any
rate
there
would
be
a
great
deal
that
her
mother
and
sister
would
wish
to
tell
her
about
him
a
week
ago
francis
breton
had
come
to
live
on
the
second
floor
in
saxton
square
had
put
there
his
own
furniture
had
brought
with
him
his
own
a
most
man
these
matters
might
have
remained
although
of
course
miss
lizzie
rand
connection
with
the
beaminster
family
made
his
arrival
of
the
most
dramatic
interest
had
not
miss
daisy
rand
miss
lizzie
prettier
and
younger
sister
happened
one
evening
to
run
into
breton
in
the
dark
hall
she
screamed
aloud
because
she
thought
him
a
burglar
became
very
shaky
about
the
knees
and
needed
assistance
as
far
as
the
rand
here
of
course
there
followed
conversation
finally
breton
was
asked
to
tea
and
accepted
the
invitation
on
this
very
afternoon
must
this
have
taken
place
lizzie
rand
knew
her
mother
and
sister
very
well
and
she
had
long
ago
learnt
that
their
motto
was
let
everything
go
for
the
sake
of
adventure
that
was
well
enough
but
when
your
income
was
very
small
indeed
and
you
wished
to
do
no
work
at
all
and
yet
to
have
your
home
pleasant
and
your
life
adventurous
certainly
someone
must
suffer
everything
had
always
fallen
upon
lizzie
rand
husband
had
been
a
colonel
and
they
had
lived
at
eastbourne
on
his
death
it
was
discovered
that
he
had
debts
and
obligations
to
a
lady
in
the
chorus
of
a
light
opera
then
popular
in
london
the
debts
and
the
lady
rand
had
covered
with
romance
because
she
considered
that
they
were
due
to
the
colonel
insatiable
appetite
for
adventure
but
romance
or
no
there
was
now
very
little
to
live
upon
they
moved
to
london
daisy
was
obviously
so
pretty
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
expect
her
to
work
and
she
would
be
married
in
a
minute
so
lizzie
had
during
the
last
five
years
kept
the
family
it
would
be
impossible
to
give
any
clear
idea
of
the
effect
on
rand
that
lizzie
connection
with
the
beaminster
family
had
rand
loved
anything
that
was
great
and
solemn
and
ceremonious
she
loved
royalties
bands
and
soldiers
gave
her
a
choke
in
her
throat
the
society
news
in
the
was
like
a
fine
picture
or
a
splendid
play
she
was
no
snob
it
was
simply
that
she
saw
life
as
a
background
to
slow
stately
figures
gorgeously
attired
in
all
england
there
was
no
one
like
the
duchess
of
wrexe
in
all
england
there
was
no
family
like
the
beaminster
family
even
royalty
had
not
quite
their
glow
and
glitter
royalty
you
might
see
any
day
driving
bowing
smiling
the
queen
had
a
smile
for
everyone
and
was
at
home
in
the
merest
cottage
but
the
duchess
the
duchess
no
one
not
even
lizzie
on
whose
shoulders
the
whole
fortunes
of
the
beaministers
rested
ever
saw
there
was
nothing
about
the
beaminsters
that
rand
did
not
know
and
so
of
course
she
knew
all
about
the
unhappy
past
history
of
francis
breton
that
any
beaminster
should
have
behaved
rather
as
her
own
dead
colonel
had
once
behaved
gave
one
a
link
at
once
rand
mind
was
at
the
best
of
times
a
confused
one
and
in
the
dead
of
night
she
could
imagine
a
scene
in
which
the
wonderful
duchess
would
send
for
her
give
her
tea
press
her
hands
and
say
ah
dear
rand
our
your
husband
and
my
grandson
what
trouble
they
give
us
but
we
love
them
nevertheless
so
romantic
was
rand
mind
that
she
saw
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
coincidence
of
breton
arrival
at
their
very
doors
of
course
he
would
arrive
there
where
else
could
he
arrive
and
of
course
he
would
fall
in
love
with
daisy
would
reform
for
her
sake
there
would
be
a
splendid
marriage
the
duchess
would
thank
rand
for
having
saved
her
grandson
yes
rand
had
an
incurably
romantic
mind
lizzie
knew
all
about
her
mother
mind
and
daisy
mind
she
dealt
with
them
very
much
as
she
dealt
with
lady
adela
mind
or
lord
mind
they
were
all
muddled
people
together
and
the
people
had
the
advantage
over
them
so
with
regard
to
her
mother
and
sister
lizzie
had
developed
a
protective
feeling
she
wished
to
save
them
from
the
inroads
of
the
people
who
might
so
rob
and
devour
them
she
saw
also
that
her
connection
with
the
beaminster
family
was
a
very
bad
thing
for
her
mother
and
sister
because
it
encouraged
them
to
be
romantic
and
muddled
and
idle
but
at
present
at
any
rate
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
as
she
turned
into
the
grey
silence
of
little
saxton
square
she
did
hope
that
her
mother
and
sister
would
not
behave
too
outrageously
about
breton
she
was
interested
she
would
like
to
see
him
his
whole
possible
relation
to
the
duchess
to
lady
adela
to
miss
beaminster
set
her
own
imagination
working
she
did
hope
that
her
mother
and
sister
would
not
behave
so
disgracefully
that
they
would
frighten
breton
away
so
that
he
would
never
come
near
them
again
and
then
as
she
reached
the
door
of
no
she
thought
for
a
moment
of
rachel
beaminster
i
like
her
she
thought
i
like
to
know
her
she
never
spoken
to
me
like
that
before
iii
no
had
three
floors
the
ground
floor
was
occupied
by
the
rands
the
first
floor
by
breton
and
the
second
floor
by
an
old
decrepit
invalid
called
cæsar
and
his
son
who
was
a
bank
clerk
down
in
the
basement
lived
and
tweed
owners
of
the
whole
house
he
had
been
a
butler
and
she
a
housekeeper
and
exceedingly
respectable
they
were
every
floor
had
its
own
kitchen
and
every
lodger
found
his
own
servants
but
the
hall
was
common
for
all
the
three
floors
and
if
young
cæsar
came
in
at
two
in
the
morning
and
banged
the
front
door
everybody
knew
about
it
it
must
have
been
a
fine
old
house
in
its
day
no
and
there
were
still
fine
carvings
good
fireplaces
and
ceilings
high
broad
windows
and
thick
solid
walls
rand
liked
to
think
that
her
had
once
seen
fine
ladies
reflected
in
its
mirrors
heard
the
tapping
of
shoes
on
its
polished
floors
the
thought
of
those
glorious
days
gave
her
own
rather
faded
furniture
a
colour
and
a
touch
of
poetry
sometimes
lizzie
thought
with
a
sigh
if
her
mother
had
inhabited
a
plain
house
living
within
a
small
income
would
have
been
easier
for
her
lizzie
entering
the
knew
at
once
that
breton
was
still
there
she
saw
that
he
was
tall
and
spare
that
he
had
no
left
arm
that
he
had
a
rather
small
pointed
brown
beard
and
eyes
that
struck
her
as
fierce
and
protesting
she
did
not
know
whether
it
were
the
beard
or
the
eyes
or
the
absence
of
the
arm
but
at
her
first
vision
of
him
she
said
to
herself
he
too
dramatic
it
not
quite
real
and
her
second
thought
was
he
just
what
mother
will
like
him
to
be
he
was
standing
against
the
window
and
he
wore
a
black
suit
a
little
faded
the
blinds
had
not
been
drawn
and
the
square
beyond
the
window
was
elephant
grey
with
the
lamps
at
each
corner
a
dim
yellow
there
was
a
thin
rather
ragged
garden
in
the
middle
of
the
square
and
in
the
garden
was
a
statue
of
a
nymph
old
and
deserted
and
some
trees
now
faintly
green
over
it
all
was
a
sky
so
pale
that
it
was
more
nearly
white
than
blue
although
the
curtains
had
not
been
drawn
a
lamp
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
lit
and
the
fire
burnt
merrily
the
furniture
had
once
been
good
and
was
now
respectable
there
were
several
photographs
a
copy
of
the
fighting
téméraire
and
a
sketch
of
lodore
falls
there
was
a
with
the
works
of
tennyson
longfellow
and
miss
braddon
and
on
one
of
the
tables
two
french
novels
one
by
gyp
and
one
by
zola
rand
would
have
been
handsome
had
her
grey
hair
been
less
untidy
and
her
clothes
more
uniform
in
design
and
colour
her
blouse
was
cut
too
low
and
she
wore
too
many
rings
her
eyes
always
wore
a
expression
as
though
she
might
be
called
on
to
be
excited
at
any
moment
and
did
wish
to
miss
the
opportunity
daisy
rand
was
pretty
and
pink
with
light
fluffy
hair
all
her
clothes
looked
as
though
their
chief
purpose
were
to
reveal
other
clothes
the
impression
that
she
left
on
a
casual
observer
was
that
she
must
be
cold
in
such
thin
things
lizzie
looking
at
frank
breton
could
not
tell
what
impression
her
sister
and
mother
had
made
upon
him
at
any
rate
she
thought
stayed
a
long
time
that
looks
as
though
he
had
been
entertained
she
was
introduced
to
him
and
liked
the
cool
firm
grasp
of
his
hand
she
saw
that
her
mother
and
daisy
were
quiet
and
subdued
that
was
a
good
thing
she
caught
before
she
sat
down
his
instinctive
look
of
surprise
she
knew
that
he
had
not
expected
her
to
be
like
that
we
been
telling
breton
lizzie
said
rand
all
about
the
theatres
he
been
away
so
long
that
he
quite
out
of
touch
with
things
lizzie
always
knew
when
her
mother
was
finding
conversation
difficult
by
the
amount
of
enthusiasm
and
surprise
that
she
put
into
her
sentences
so
terrible
it
must
be
to
have
missed
so
many
splendid
things
i
assure
you
rand
said
breton
that
i
been
seeing
other
splendid
things
in
other
countries
now
i
ready
for
this
one
again
rand
was
silent
and
at
a
loss
lizzie
knew
the
explanation
of
this
her
mother
had
been
trying
to
venture
on
to
the
subject
of
family
and
had
found
unexpected
difficulty
perhaps
there
had
been
something
in
breton
attitude
that
had
warned
her
they
talked
for
a
little
while
but
disjointedly
then
suddenly
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
young
cæsar
a
bony
youth
with
a
high
collar
and
an
unsuccessful
moustache
came
in
he
had
not
very
much
to
say
but
the
result
of
his
coming
was
that
lizzie
found
herself
standing
at
the
window
with
breton
they
looked
at
the
square
now
sinking
into
dusk
he
spoke
his
voice
was
lowered
i
understand
that
you
are
secretary
to
my
aunt
miss
rand
yes
she
said
they
have
heard
of
my
return
with
any
great
delight
i
afraid
she
noticed
that
he
was
trying
to
steady
his
voice
but
that
it
shook
a
little
in
spite
of
his
efforts
i
do
know
she
said
looking
up
and
smiling
i
far
too
busy
to
think
of
things
that
are
not
my
concern
they
are
giving
a
ball
night
for
my
cousin
yes
do
you
see
much
of
her
no
nothing
at
all
she
been
abroad
you
know
yes
so
i
heard
but
i
saw
her
driving
yesterday
she
looks
different
from
the
rest
of
them
all
this
time
as
he
spoke
to
her
she
was
conscious
of
his
eyes
if
only
she
could
have
been
sure
that
the
protest
in
them
was
genuine
she
would
have
been
moved
by
them
she
did
not
help
him
in
any
way
and
perhaps
her
silence
made
him
feel
that
he
had
done
wrong
to
speak
to
her
about
his
affairs
they
looked
at
the
square
for
a
little
time
in
silence
at
last
speaking
without
any
implied
fierceness
he
said
you
know
miss
rand
i
a
wanderer
by
nature
and
sometimes
i
find
cities
very
hard
to
bear
do
you
know
what
i
do
no
she
said
turn
them
into
other
things
now
here
in
london
do
you
never
think
of
streets
as
waterways
portland
place
for
instance
is
like
ever
so
many
rivers
i
seen
broad
and
shining
and
some
of
those
high
thin
streets
beside
it
are
like
canals
oxford
circus
is
a
whirlpool
and
so
on
he
laughed
i
get
no
end
of
relief
from
thinking
of
things
like
that
you
hate
cities
she
asked
him
no
not
really
but
it
depends
how
they
receive
you
if
hostile
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
this
square
she
said
what
this
square
a
pool
all
the
houses
hang
over
it
as
though
they
were
hiding
it
restful
like
a
pool
there
no
noise
the
statue
of
the
nymph
had
disappeared
the
trees
were
a
black
splash
against
the
walls
lights
were
in
the
windows
he
seemed
suddenly
conscious
that
it
was
late
when
he
had
gone
lizzie
stood
for
some
time
looking
into
the
square
and
thinking
how
right
he
had
been
all
that
evening
daisy
was
out
of
temper
chapter
v
she
comes
out
i
downstairs
the
was
at
its
height
newton
the
housekeeper
went
softly
down
the
passages
to
give
one
last
glimpse
at
the
ballroom
there
it
lay
like
a
great
golden
shell
empty
expectant
the
walls
were
white
the
ceilings
gold
on
the
white
walls
hung
the
lelys
the
van
dycks
and
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
portrait
of
her
grace
brought
up
for
this
especial
occasion
from
the
long
there
was
the
gleaming
shining
floor
there
the
golden
chairs
with
their
backs
against
the
wall
and
there
before
each
picture
a
little
globe
of
golden
flame
ministering
to
its
beauties
throwing
the
proud
pale
faces
of
the
old
beaminsters
into
scornful
relief
and
none
of
them
so
scornful
as
that
duchess
in
the
far
distance
frowning
from
her
golden
frame
newton
was
plump
and
important
she
worshipped
the
beaminster
family
and
it
yielded
her
now
intense
satisfaction
to
see
these
rooms
that
were
used
so
seldom
given
to
their
proper
glory
and
ceremony
for
a
moment
as
she
stood
there
and
felt
the
fine
reflection
of
all
that
light
upon
the
shining
floor
absorbed
the
silence
and
the
space
and
the
colour
she
was
uplifted
with
pride
and
thanked
her
god
that
she
was
not
as
other
women
were
but
had
been
permitted
by
him
to
assist
in
no
small
measure
in
the
glories
and
splendours
of
this
great
family
then
with
a
little
sigh
of
satisfied
approval
she
softly
walked
away
again
ii
two
hours
later
rachel
beaminster
standing
a
little
behind
her
aunt
saw
the
people
pressing
up
the
stairs
to
those
who
watched
her
she
seemed
perfectly
composed
her
flushed
cheeks
her
white
dress
her
dark
hair
and
eyes
gave
her
distinction
against
the
colour
and
movement
of
the
room
her
eyes
were
a
little
stern
and
her
body
was
held
proudly
but
her
hands
moved
with
sharp
spasmodic
movements
against
her
dress
as
she
stood
there
men
were
brought
up
to
her
in
constant
succession
and
introduced
they
wrote
their
names
on
her
programme
bowed
and
went
away
she
smiled
at
each
one
of
them
before
dinner
she
had
been
introduced
to
the
prince
german
fat
and
cheerful
and
the
second
dance
of
the
evening
was
to
be
with
him
some
of
the
men
who
had
been
dining
in
the
house
she
already
knew
lord
crewner
roddy
seddon
lord
massiter
and
others
and
once
or
twice
now
the
faces
that
were
led
up
to
her
were
familiar
to
her
the
great
ballroom
seemed
to
be
already
filled
with
people
and
still
they
came
pressing
up
the
stairs
rachel
was
miserably
unhappy
for
one
moment
before
she
had
left
her
room
where
her
maid
had
stood
admiringly
beside
her
when
she
herself
had
seen
the
reflection
of
the
white
dress
and
the
dark
hair
and
the
flushed
cheeks
in
the
long
mirror
for
one
great
moment
she
had
been
filled
with
exaltation
this
ball
this
agitation
this
excitement
was
all
for
her
the
world
was
at
her
feet
the
locked
doors
were
at
last
rolling
open
before
her
and
all
life
was
to
be
revealed
pearls
that
uncle
john
had
given
her
were
her
only
ornament
they
laughed
at
her
from
the
mirror
laughed
and
promised
her
success
conquest
glory
life
at
that
instant
was
very
precious
but
alas
the
dinner
had
been
a
terrible
failure
she
had
sat
between
lord
crewner
and
lord
massiter
and
had
no
word
to
say
to
either
of
them
lord
massiter
was
and
hearty
and
kind
and
he
had
done
his
best
for
her
but
she
had
been
paralysed
they
had
talked
to
her
about
the
opera
the
theatres
hunting
books
munich
she
had
had
a
great
deal
to
say
about
all
these
things
and
she
had
said
nothing
always
within
her
there
seemed
to
be
rivalry
between
the
beaminster
way
of
saying
things
and
the
other
way
when
lord
crewner
said
to
her
what
i
like
in
music
is
a
real
cheerful
little
piece
that
one
can
go
to
after
dinner
you
know
there
were
a
whole
number
of
beaminster
observations
to
make
but
as
soon
as
they
rose
to
her
mouth
something
within
her
whispered
you
know
that
you
do
mean
that
that
at
second
hand
give
him
your
opinion
and
then
that
seemed
presumption
so
she
said
nothing
it
was
all
wretched
and
quite
endless
uncle
john
sent
her
encouraging
smiles
every
now
and
again
but
she
felt
that
he
must
be
disappointed
at
her
failure
the
food
choked
her
the
tears
filled
her
eyes
and
it
was
her
pride
only
that
saved
her
through
it
all
she
felt
that
her
grandmother
upstairs
in
her
bedroom
was
planning
this
afterwards
the
princess
seeing
perhaps
that
she
was
unhappy
was
kind
and
motherly
to
her
and
told
her
funny
stories
about
her
childhood
in
berlin
but
all
the
time
rachel
was
saying
to
herself
you
a
fool
you
a
fool
you
got
no
at
all
she
had
been
dreading
the
introductions
to
so
many
young
men
but
she
found
that
that
was
easy
enough
they
were
not
young
men
they
were
simply
numbers
on
her
programme
and
they
vanished
as
soon
as
they
came
then
the
band
in
the
distance
began
to
play
an
extra
whilst
the
young
men
wandered
about
and
discovered
their
friends
and
the
sound
of
the
music
cheered
her
it
amused
her
now
to
watch
the
people
as
they
mounted
the
stairs
she
noticed
that
all
the
faces
were
grave
and
preoccupied
until
a
moment
before
the
arrival
at
aunt
adela
and
then
a
smile
was
tightly
fastened
on
held
for
a
moment
and
then
dropped
to
give
way
to
the
preoccupation
again
the
room
was
so
full
now
that
it
seemed
that
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
any
dancing
to
take
place
uncle
john
was
working
very
hard
at
introducing
people
to
one
another
and
as
she
saw
his
face
and
his
white
hair
her
heart
went
out
to
him
if
everyone
were
as
kind
as
uncle
john
how
nice
the
world
would
be
meanwhile
her
eyes
anxiously
watched
the
stairs
and
as
every
woman
turned
the
corner
at
the
bottom
the
question
was
was
this
may
eversley
there
had
been
a
battle
about
may
aunt
adela
did
not
like
her
disapproved
of
her
would
not
hear
of
inviting
her
very
well
then
rachel
would
not
come
to
the
ball
at
all
they
could
give
the
ball
for
somebody
else
if
may
were
not
asked
rachel
would
not
come
so
lady
eversley
and
may
had
both
been
asked
and
of
course
they
had
accepted
rachel
waited
and
gazed
and
was
continually
disappointed
the
extra
was
over
and
soon
the
first
dance
would
begin
with
the
second
dance
would
arrive
the
prince
and
rachel
would
have
no
talk
with
may
at
all
it
was
too
bad
of
may
to
be
late
she
had
promised
so
faithfully
ah
there
she
was
with
her
air
of
one
confidently
conducting
a
most
difficult
campaign
she
mounted
the
stairs
like
a
general
gave
lady
adela
the
tiniest
of
smiles
and
was
at
rachel
side
that
clasp
of
may
hand
filled
rachel
body
with
confident
happiness
may
hardy
her
discipline
derived
from
some
stern
old
puritans
dim
centuries
away
was
all
waiting
there
at
rachel
service
how
late
you
are
mother
was
such
a
time
and
then
we
could
get
a
cab
how
are
you
rachel
dinner
was
terrible
all
wrong
i
had
a
word
to
say
to
anyone
better
now
that
you
come
is
the
prince
here
yes
i
dancing
the
next
dance
with
him
the
princess
was
very
kind
after
dinner
oh
may
dinner
was
a
disaster
an
absolute
disaster
not
nearly
so
bad
as
you
thought
you
may
be
sure
things
always
seem
so
much
worse
and
now
may
had
been
discovered
gentlemen
young
and
old
dangled
their
programmes
in
front
of
her
were
received
were
dismissed
may
had
the
air
of
a
general
sitting
fiercely
in
his
tent
and
receiving
reports
from
his
officers
as
to
the
progress
in
the
field
confident
young
men
were
instantly
timid
before
her
the
first
dance
was
over
against
the
white
splendour
vivid
colours
were
flung
and
withdrawn
threads
and
patterns
crossed
and
recrossed
and
then
presently
the
glittering
floor
was
waste
and
deserted
on
its
surface
was
reflected
dark
gold
from
the
shining
walls
the
second
dance
came
and
with
it
the
prince
rachel
had
now
lost
all
sense
of
the
ball
having
been
given
in
any
way
for
herself
the
dancing
it
comforted
her
to
see
was
not
of
the
very
best
and
at
once
she
found
that
she
had
herself
nothing
to
fear
the
prince
danced
well
and
soon
she
was
lost
to
all
sense
of
everything
save
the
immediate
joy
of
rhythm
and
balance
and
the
perfect
spontaneity
of
the
music
and
her
acknowledgment
of
it
when
it
came
to
an
end
and
they
were
sitting
in
a
corner
somewhere
he
was
a
fat
man
again
and
she
rachel
beaminster
but
she
knew
now
for
what
life
was
intended
after
that
for
a
long
period
her
dancers
did
not
concern
her
they
were
there
simply
to
supply
her
with
that
ecstasy
of
rhythm
and
movement
sometimes
they
could
not
supply
her
because
they
were
bad
dancers
and
one
of
her
partners
was
indeed
so
bad
that
she
ruthlessly
suggested
after
one
turn
round
the
room
that
they
should
sit
out
then
she
sat
in
a
room
near
at
hand
irritated
by
the
sound
of
that
glorious
music
and
paying
very
scant
attention
to
the
young
man
stammered
apologies
his
information
about
his
experiences
of
paris
and
the
way
that
he
shot
birds
in
scotland
she
was
to
go
down
to
supper
with
roddy
seddon
and
she
was
waiting
that
experience
with
some
curiosity
if
her
grandmother
were
so
fond
of
him
then
he
must
be
a
disagreeable
young
man
and
yet
his
appearance
was
not
disagreeable
he
looked
as
though
like
uncle
john
and
chris
he
were
one
of
the
comfortable
people
chris
by
the
way
had
not
arrived
he
had
told
her
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
escape
until
late
hours
and
so
as
the
evening
advanced
her
happiness
grew
impossible
now
to
understand
that
speechlessness
at
dinner
impossible
to
find
reasons
for
that
earlier
misery
she
danced
now
both
with
lord
massiter
and
with
lord
crewner
and
said
exactly
what
she
thought
to
both
of
them
impossible
now
to
imagine
anything
but
that
the
world
was
an
enchanting
thrilling
place
especially
invented
for
the
happiness
of
miss
rachel
beaminster
iii
uncle
john
had
been
promised
a
dance
his
moment
arrived
he
had
watched
her
during
the
early
part
of
the
evening
and
had
been
afraid
that
she
was
not
at
all
happy
she
was
so
unlike
other
girls
and
that
first
miserable
hour
seemed
to
him
the
most
tragic
omen
of
her
future
career
how
is
she
to
get
on
if
she
takes
things
as
badly
as
this
i
wish
i
could
help
her
i
know
so
exactly
how
she
must
be
feeling
but
imagine
him
now
confronted
with
a
figure
that
shone
with
happiness
with
success
with
splendour
she
caught
his
arm
come
uncle
john
we
wo
dance
we
talk
up
here
there
no
one
in
this
room
she
ran
ahead
of
him
found
a
corner
for
them
both
and
then
pushing
him
on
to
a
sofa
twisted
round
in
front
of
him
turning
on
her
toes
flashing
laughter
at
him
sitting
down
at
last
beside
him
and
then
kissing
him
oh
my
dear
i
so
glad
he
said
i
thought
you
were
miserable
so
i
was
at
first
perfectly
wretched
now
it
all
splendid
glorious
this
was
to
him
an
entirely
new
rachel
in
her
movement
her
excitement
her
immediate
glad
acceptance
of
the
life
that
an
hour
ago
she
had
feared
with
such
alarm
he
perceived
an
element
that
was
indeed
foreign
to
all
things
beaminster
and
this
new
attitude
reminded
him
with
renewed
sharpness
that
he
could
not
now
hope
to
hold
the
old
rachel
with
the
intimate
affection
that
had
been
his
before
she
was
slipping
from
him
slipping
even
as
he
watched
her
she
was
going
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
uncle
john
i
a
success
i
am
really
i
can
dance
dance
beautifully
i
can
put
these
young
men
in
their
places
they
frightened
really
frightened
of
course
you
lovely
the
biggest
success
there
ever
been
but
what
was
the
matter
with
you
at
dinner
yes
was
that
dreadful
everything
went
wrong
and
the
only
thing
i
could
think
of
was
how
glad
grandmamma
would
be
i
had
a
kind
of
paralysis
uncle
john
nodded
his
head
i
know
exactly
what
it
like
well
i
shall
never
let
myself
be
so
stupid
again
never
i
swear
it
they
sat
in
silence
for
some
time
she
restless
straining
towards
the
music
he
a
little
overcome
by
her
happiness
there
was
a
pause
between
the
dances
and
then
the
band
began
once
more
have
you
danced
with
roddy
seddon
yet
no
what
he
like
oh
he
nice
you
like
him
i
do
expect
to
he
a
friend
of
grandmamma
hark
there
the
band
again
come
along
back
we
go
smiling
radiant
she
hung
upon
his
arm
afterwards
standing
in
a
doorway
he
watched
her
he
sighed
what
a
selfish
old
pig
i
am
but
she
never
be
mine
again
iv
uncle
john
held
only
for
a
moment
rachel
attention
no
single
person
now
but
rather
a
gorgeous
pattern
that
the
whole
evening
was
weaving
about
her
she
saw
the
lights
she
heard
the
music
she
felt
the
movement
of
her
body
she
gathered
through
a
haze
of
happiness
the
faces
of
her
uncles
and
aunt
adela
and
others
whom
she
knew
but
now
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
knew
what
happiness
happiness
without
thought
or
doubt
or
foreboding
could
be
thus
it
was
that
she
came
to
roddy
seddon
who
was
certainly
enjoying
himself
this
however
was
not
the
first
ball
of
his
life
nor
even
if
all
the
truth
were
known
his
best
he
had
expected
it
to
be
solemn
and
sedate
you
could
not
hope
to
find
here
the
jolly
kind
of
dance
that
they
had
had
at
the
menets
for
instance
last
week
that
would
not
be
possible
in
a
beaminster
household
it
was
all
to
be
honest
a
little
things
were
moving
a
bit
faster
nowadays
waltzes
and
lancers
were
all
very
well
but
one
might
have
had
a
cotillon
something
unexpected
however
may
eversley
and
one
or
two
other
girls
had
had
the
right
kind
of
go
about
them
he
smiled
a
little
and
tugged
at
his
short
bristling
yellow
moustache
and
then
discovered
that
it
was
time
to
take
rachel
beaminster
down
to
supper
this
event
was
of
more
than
ordinary
interest
to
him
he
was
perfectly
aware
that
most
of
his
friends
and
relatives
thought
that
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
for
him
to
marry
rachel
beaminster
he
was
himself
not
scornful
of
this
idea
he
was
and
it
was
time
that
seddon
court
in
sussex
had
a
mistress
his
life
had
been
varied
and
exciting
and
it
was
right
now
that
he
should
make
some
ties
there
were
a
number
of
other
reasons
in
favour
of
his
marrying
as
to
rachel
beaminster
she
was
not
pretty
but
she
was
interesting
she
was
unusual
moreover
she
was
a
beaminster
and
an
alliance
with
that
ancient
family
would
be
past
dispute
a
magnificent
alliance
but
the
element
in
it
all
that
intrigued
him
most
was
the
fact
that
nobody
could
tell
him
anything
about
rachel
even
may
eversley
who
knew
her
so
well
was
not
sure
about
her
you
go
on
being
surprised
she
had
said
surprise
indeed
was
waiting
for
him
this
evening
on
the
few
occasions
that
he
had
seen
rachel
he
had
seen
her
grave
shy
a
little
awkward
most
reserved
now
she
met
him
as
though
she
had
known
him
for
years
glowing
almost
pretty
so
burning
were
her
eyes
at
supper
she
laughed
called
across
the
room
to
may
agreed
with
everything
that
everybody
said
and
with
it
all
was
younger
than
any
girl
that
he
had
ever
known
the
girls
who
were
roddy
friends
talked
about
life
at
times
more
boldly
than
he
would
have
talked
with
his
men
friends
and
were
at
all
events
for
ever
hinting
at
the
things
that
they
knew
rachel
hinted
at
nothing
she
kept
nothing
back
she
allowed
him
no
disguises
oh
do
i
wish
she
cried
that
this
night
could
go
on
for
ever
just
like
this
and
he
taking
the
compliment
to
himself
agreed
with
her
he
had
expected
to
find
someone
haughty
and
cold
a
young
aunt
adela
with
a
dash
of
foreign
temper
he
found
someone
entirely
delightful
afterwards
when
they
sat
out
on
a
balcony
overlooking
portland
place
he
was
encouraged
to
talk
about
himself
i
like
all
this
you
know
he
said
waving
his
hand
at
the
grey
mysterious
street
that
the
pale
lamps
so
mournfully
guarded
i
like
this
air
comin
along
from
the
park
i
all
for
the
open
miss
beaminster
horses
and
dogs
and
rushin
along
with
the
wind
at
your
back
it
a
rippin
little
place
i
got
down
in
sussex
i
hope
see
it
one
day
old
as
anything
with
jolly
roman
roads
and
such
around
and
the
most
spiffin
lot
of
gees
look
the
sun
will
be
above
the
houses
soon
i
seen
some
sunrises
in
my
day
you
ought
to
be
on
the
downs
at
night
miss
beaminster
roddy
was
surprised
at
himself
at
the
way
that
he
was
talking
but
she
really
looked
quite
beautiful
there
in
the
window
with
her
dark
hair
and
her
eyes
and
white
dress
i
ca
tell
you
she
said
when
it
was
time
for
them
to
part
how
much
all
you
say
interests
me
i
love
horses
too
and
i
adore
dogs
i
got
a
dog
i
like
you
to
have
he
began
it
a
oh
no
she
answered
aunt
adela
would
never
let
me
keep
one
here
thank
you
all
the
same
but
you
let
me
come
down
to
seddon
court
one
day
wo
you
let
you
roddy
could
find
no
words
she
flung
one
glance
at
the
square
where
the
dawn
was
beginning
and
then
was
back
in
the
ballroom
again
dancing
dancing
dancing
the
sky
was
all
pink
above
the
roofs
and
the
birds
were
making
a
whirl
of
chattering
when
her
bedroom
received
her
again
her
maid
was
sleepy
but
proud
they
all
say
it
been
a
great
success
miss
rachel
success
she
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
her
arms
extended
oh
it
been
glorious
glorious
i
never
she
paused
her
arms
fell
to
her
sides
oh
chris
chris
he
never
came
he
said
that
he
might
be
able
it
was
the
only
thing
that
was
wrong
then
more
slowly
as
she
moved
to
her
and
all
the
last
part
i
never
missed
him
well
i
dare
say
said
lucy
standing
behind
rachel
chair
and
staring
at
the
white
face
in
the
mirror
that
with
his
patients
and
the
rest
he
could
get
away
oh
but
i
ought
to
have
missed
him
said
rachel
and
afterwards
lying
in
bed
sleepless
with
excitement
it
was
christopher
face
that
she
saw

i
on
the
afternoon
that
followed
the
ball
lady
adela
took
rachel
to
tea
with
lord
richard
it
was
a
superb
may
afternoon
white
clouds
were
piled
in
the
heavens
and
made
so
rounded
were
they
the
blue
sky
seem
an
infinite
distance
away
it
was
a
day
of
sparkling
dazzling
gaiety
the
air
seemed
electric
with
the
happiness
of
the
world
and
as
they
drove
down
to
grosvenor
street
rachel
felt
that
the
little
breeze
that
just
touched
the
hats
and
coats
of
the
people
on
the
omnibuses
was
created
simply
by
the
joy
of
the
beautiful
weather
as
they
moved
slowly
down
bond
street
rachel
looked
at
the
world
and
thought
of
last
night
she
looked
at
the
men
with
their
shining
hats
and
shining
boots
at
the
messenger
boys
and
the
young
women
with
parcels
and
the
young
women
without
at
the
old
men
who
thought
themselves
young
and
the
young
men
who
thought
themselves
old
at
the
fish
shops
and
the
picture
galleries
at
the
jewellers
and
the
book
shops
at
the
place
where
they
taught
you
swedish
exercises
and
the
place
where
there
was
a
palmist
with
a
japanese
name
and
it
was
all
splendid
and
magnificent
and
simply
carried
on
the
glories
of
the
night
before
before
the
turning
into
grosvenor
street
there
was
a
great
crush
of
carriages
and
a
long
pause
in
the
carriage
next
to
rachel
there
was
a
very
stout
very
richly
coloured
lady
with
a
strong
scent
and
a
pug
dog
a
little
farther
away
there
were
two
young
gentlemen
in
a
smart
little
carriage
and
their
hats
were
so
large
and
their
expression
so
haughty
and
the
top
of
their
canes
so
golden
that
it
seemed
absurd
that
they
should
have
to
wait
for
anybody
and
near
them
was
a
small
boy
on
a
little
cart
and
near
him
an
omnibus
with
a
driver
and
any
number
of
interested
ladies
and
all
these
incongruities
seemed
only
to
add
to
the
haphazard
happiness
of
this
shining
afternoon
rachel
had
many
things
to
consider
as
she
sat
there
aunt
adela
did
not
interfere
with
her
thoughts
because
she
never
talked
when
she
was
in
a
carriage
but
always
sat
up
and
looked
wearily
at
the
people
about
her
she
had
never
very
much
to
say
but
the
open
air
made
her
feel
stupid
rachel
was
aware
that
last
night
had
altered
her
point
of
view
for
all
time
she
was
aware
as
she
sat
there
in
sunshine
of
a
new
world
by
one
glance
at
aunt
adela
was
this
new
world
made
apparent
aunt
adela
had
hitherto
been
important
aunt
adela
was
now
unimportant
had
this
afternoon
been
wet
and
gloomy
then
rachel
might
have
doubted
that
passionate
discovery
of
the
world
that
she
now
felt
was
hers
but
here
with
this
blazing
sun
and
sky
the
note
was
sustained
surely
never
again
would
rachel
be
afraid
of
her
grandmother
surely
never
again
would
she
be
afraid
of
anyone
holding
herself
very
proudly
in
a
dress
that
was
a
soft
primrose
colour
and
in
a
hat
that
was
dark
and
shady
rachel
looked
round
about
her
on
the
world
there
lady
massiter
lady
adela
smiled
lightly
and
bowed
a
very
little
monty
carfax
is
with
her
rachel
thought
of
lord
massiter
and
wondered
again
at
last
dinner
how
could
i
have
been
like
that
how
i
there
passed
them
a
very
handsome
carriage
with
a
little
dark
handsome
lady
who
looked
happily
round
about
her
all
alone
in
her
magnificence
rachel
did
not
know
whether
her
aunt
had
seen
or
no
here
was
the
beaminster
bronson
a
young
american
widow
incredibly
rich
incredibly
fascinating
incredibly
bold
bronson
had
been
in
london
only
a
year
had
snapped
her
jewelled
fingers
at
the
beaminsters
and
everything
that
they
stood
for
had
laughed
at
snubs
and
threats
was
intending
so
it
was
said
to
have
london
at
her
feet
in
a
season
or
two
rachel
considered
her
she
was
like
some
jewelled
bird
of
paradise
she
was
one
must
admit
it
better
suited
to
this
glorious
day
than
was
aunt
adela
why
need
aunt
adela
refuse
to
be
glad
because
the
sun
was
shining
why
could
not
aunt
adela
have
said
something
pleasant
about
last
dance
why
must
this
absurd
outward
dignity
be
so
carefully
maintained
why
when
one
was
looking
attractive
in
a
primrose
dress
could
one
aunt
not
say
so
that
reminded
her
of
roddy
seddon
she
liked
him
he
might
be
a
real
friend
like
christopher
the
thought
of
him
made
her
as
she
sat
there
in
the
sun
feel
doubly
certain
that
the
world
was
a
comfortable
reassuring
place
and
that
that
vision
of
cold
spaces
and
dark
forests
that
had
been
so
often
with
her
was
now
to
be
banished
like
an
evil
dream
never
to
return
at
the
end
of
grosvenor
street
the
trees
were
so
green
that
they
might
have
been
painted
and
here
they
were
at
uncle
richard
house
ii
but
with
the
closing
of
uncle
richard
doors
the
sun
was
taken
from
the
world
uncle
richard
house
was
always
soft
and
dim
like
one
of
those
little
jewel
cases
all
wadding
and
dark
wood
uncle
carpets
were
so
thick
and
soft
that
everyone
seemed
to
walk
on
and
the
wonderful
old
prints
in
the
hall
and
the
beautiful
dark
carving
on
the
staircase
and
the
sudden
swiftness
of
the
doors
as
they
closed
behind
you
only
helped
to
increase
the
impression
that
everything
here
yourself
included
was
in
for
a
beautiful
exhibition
and
that
light
might
hurt
the
exhibits
uncle
richard
study
where
they
always
had
tea
was
lined
from
roof
to
ceiling
with
and
behind
the
shining
glass
there
gleamed
the
backs
of
the
haughtiest
and
proudest
books
in
the
world
for
were
they
old
and
dingy
then
they
were
first
editions
of
transcendent
value
and
were
they
new
and
shining
then
were
they
editions
de
luxe
or
some
of
uncle
richard
favourites
bound
in
the
most
intricate
and
precious
of
bindings
some
china
on
the
mantelpiece
was
so
valuable
that
housemaids
must
surely
have
a
sleepless
time
because
of
it
and
all
the
furniture
was
so
conscious
of
its
rich
and
ancient
glories
that
to
sit
down
on
the
chairs
or
to
lean
on
the
tables
was
to
offer
them
terrible
insults
two
conders
and
a
corot
shone
from
the
grey
walls
in
the
midst
of
this
was
uncle
richard
elaborately
ironically
indifferent
to
all
emotions
i
have
governed
the
country
yes
but
really
my
friends
scarcely
a
job
for
a
fine
spirit
nowadays
i
have
collected
these
few
things
yes
but
after
all
what
does
it
come
to
do
many
do
the
same
rachel
as
she
stood
in
the
room
felt
that
her
newly
found
independence
was
slipping
away
from
her
with
the
departure
of
the
sun
had
fled
also
that
consciousness
of
last
night
splendours
about
her
again
was
creeping
that
atmosphere
that
was
always
with
her
in
this
room
something
that
made
her
feel
that
she
was
a
wretched
ignorant
beaminster
and
that
even
if
she
did
learn
the
value
of
all
these
precious
things
why
then
that
knowledge
was
of
little
enough
use
to
her
uncle
richard
with
his
high
white
forehead
his
long
dark
trousers
his
grey
spats
and
his
great
collar
that
bent
back
in
humble
deference
before
the
nobility
of
his
neck
and
chin
uncle
richard
required
a
great
deal
of
courage
well
dear
i
hope
you
enjoyed
your
dance
yes
uncle
richard
thank
you
i
left
early
but
everything
seemed
to
be
going
very
well
yes
i
think
it
was
all
right
how
different
this
from
the
fashion
in
which
she
had
intended
to
fling
her
enthusiasm
upon
him
what
she
wondered
would
have
been
the
effect
had
she
done
so
how
would
he
have
taken
it
could
she
have
pierced
that
melancholy
ironical
armour
that
always
kept
the
real
man
from
her
meanwhile
she
was
now
back
again
in
the
old
old
world
tea
was
brought
the
footman
and
butler
moved
softly
about
the
room
aunt
adela
said
a
little
uncle
richard
said
a
little
the
lid
was
down
upon
the
world
meanwhile
impossible
to
imagine
that
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
there
had
been
that
gay
confusion
in
bond
street
impossible
to
believe
bronson
in
her
carriage
anything
but
common
and
vulgar
impossible
to
prefer
that
dazzling
sun
to
this
cloistered
quiet
a
wonderful
lacquered
clock
ticked
the
minutes
away
i
in
a
cage
in
a
cage
and
i
want
to
get
out
someone
in
rachel
beaminster
was
crying
and
someone
else
replied
thank
god
that
you
are
allowed
to
be
in
such
a
cage
at
all
there
no
other
cage
so
splendid
her
primrose
gown
was
forgotten
when
uncle
richard
asked
her
questions
she
answered
yes
or
no
her
old
terrors
had
returned
upon
the
three
of
them
sitting
thus
roddy
seddon
was
announced
roddy
had
assaulted
and
conquered
lord
richard
in
as
masterly
a
fashion
as
he
had
subdued
the
duchess
and
lady
adela
he
had
done
it
simply
by
presenting
so
boisterous
and
honest
an
allegiance
to
the
beaminster
standard
lord
richard
irony
had
been
useless
against
ingenuous
appeal
moreover
there
was
the
duchess
advocacy
young
seddon
was
the
hope
of
the
party
roddy
brought
to
view
no
evidence
of
last
night
energies
he
was
as
fresh
as
highly
coloured
as
browned
and
bronzed
and
clear
as
any
pastoral
shepherd
his
skin
was
so
finely
coloured
that
clothes
always
seemed
with
him
a
pity
lord
richard
melancholy
cynicism
had
poor
chance
against
such
vigour
his
eyes
as
they
fastened
upon
rachel
brightened
she
gave
that
dim
room
such
fresh
pleasure
sitting
there
in
her
primrose
frock
with
her
serious
eyes
and
long
hands
no
she
was
not
beautiful
he
knew
that
his
last
night
impression
had
been
the
true
one
but
she
was
unusual
she
would
make
he
was
sure
a
most
unusual
companion
you
would
think
it
may
eversley
had
said
but
there
any
amount
of
fun
in
rachel
you
find
it
when
you
know
her
he
was
not
sure
but
that
he
saw
it
now
lurking
in
her
eyes
her
mouth
as
she
sat
there
so
gravely
opposite
to
her
uncle
and
aunt
how
d
do
lady
adela
how
d
do
miss
beaminster
how
are
you
sir
thanks
i
will
have
some
tea
pretty
gorgeous
day
ai
it
rippin
dance
of
yours
last
night
lady
adela
meanwhile
rachel
knew
that
she
had
nothing
to
say
to
him
out
there
in
the
sunlight
she
might
perhaps
have
maintained
that
relationship
that
had
been
begun
between
them
the
night
before
but
in
here
with
aunt
adela
and
uncle
richard
so
consciously
an
audience
with
the
air
so
dim
and
the
walls
so
grey
roddy
seddon
seemed
the
most
strident
of
strangers
she
sat
silently
whilst
he
talked
to
aunt
adela
i
never
had
so
toppin
a
dance
as
last
night
my
soul
no
young
milhaven
whom
i
tumbled
on
at
brook
at
luncheon
said
the
same
band
and
floor
spiffin
i
glad
you
liked
it
roddy
said
lady
adela
with
a
dry
little
smile
i
must
confess
to
being
glad
that
it
over
roddy
glanced
a
little
shyly
at
rachel
i
suppose
you
goin
hard
at
it
now
miss
beaminster
she
looked
across
the
at
him
there
lady
grode
and
lady
massiter
and
lady
carloes
is
giving
one
for
her
niece
the
massiter
thing
ought
to
be
a
good
one
always
do
it
well
said
roddy
my
word
on
a
day
like
this
makes
one
hot
to
think
of
dancing
he
was
perplexed
he
had
instantly
perceived
that
he
had
here
a
rachel
beaminster
very
different
from
last
night
heroine
she
was
now
beyond
all
contemplated
intimacy
he
had
heard
others
speak
of
that
aloofness
that
came
like
a
cloud
about
her
he
now
saw
it
for
himself
after
a
time
he
came
across
to
her
whilst
lady
adela
and
her
brother
talked
as
though
the
world
consisted
of
one
beaminster
railed
round
by
high
palings
over
which
a
host
of
foolish
people
were
trying
to
climb
he
stood
beside
her
smiling
in
that
slightly
embarrassed
manner
of
his
a
manner
that
caused
those
who
did
not
know
him
to
say
that
they
liked
roddy
seddon
because
he
was
so
modest
such
a
day
it
seems
a
shame
to
be
in
town
yes
is
it
lovely
the
opera
pretty
hot
in
the
evenin
just
now
have
you
been
yet
i
been
in
munich
often
i
never
been
here
my
word
have
you
really
wish
i
could
say
the
same
i
always
bein
dragged
why
do
you
go
if
you
do
care
about
it
ca
think
always
askin
myself
why
do
half
the
johnnies
go
and
yet
in
a
way
i
like
some
sorts
o
music
kind
of
music
sittin
in
the
dark
in
a
room
with
someone
just
strokin
the
piano
up
and
down
just
strokin
it
not
hammerin
it
i
do
care
what
the
old
tune
is
rachel
laughed
a
little
but
said
nothing
of
course
she
thought
him
the
most
thundering
kind
of
fool
and
this
made
him
eager
to
display
to
her
his
wisdom
and
common
sense
but
he
could
say
nothing
there
followed
the
most
awkward
silence
she
did
not
try
to
help
him
but
sat
there
quietly
looking
in
front
of
her
suddenly
she
said
uncle
richard
i
want
to
see
your
fans
again
i
have
seen
them
for
a
long
time
i
know
you
added
some
lately
sir
roderick
have
you
ever
seen
my
uncle
fans
no
he
said
i
be
delighted
lord
richard
eyes
lifted
the
lines
of
his
mouth
grew
softer
rachel
watched
him
now
he
pretend
she
said
that
he
care
he
pretend
that
they
nothing
to
him
at
all
he
went
in
his
solemn
guarded
manner
to
a
place
in
the
room
where
a
large
cabinet
was
let
into
the
wall
he
drew
this
cabinet
forward
and
then
out
of
it
moving
his
hands
almost
pontifically
he
pulled
trays
and
on
these
trays
lay
the
fans
the
others
had
gathered
around
him
there
were
nearly
five
hundred
fans
fans
dutch
and
italian
and
french
and
chinese
and
japanese
fans
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
of
the
eighteenth
and
of
the
empire
modern
japanese
heavy
with
iron
spokes
others
light
as
gossamer
with
spokes
of
ivory
or
tortoise
shell
there
were
french
fans
painted
only
on
one
side
with
pictures
of
fantastic
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
there
were
chinese
fans
with
bridges
and
mandarins
and
towers
empire
fans
perforated
with
tinsel
and
such
lovely
shades
of
colour
that
they
seemed
to
change
as
one
gazed
there
they
all
lay
in
that
rich
solemn
room
quietly
proudly
conscious
of
their
beauty
needing
no
word
of
praise
catching
all
the
colour
and
the
daintiness
and
fragrance
that
had
ever
been
in
the
world
rachel
drank
in
their
splendour
and
then
looked
about
her
uncle
richard
eyes
were
flaming
and
his
hands
trembling
against
the
case
then
she
looked
at
roddy
seddon
his
head
was
flung
back
with
eyes
and
mouth
with
every
vein
and
fibre
of
his
body
he
was
drinking
in
their
glory
his
eyes
were
suddenly
caught
away
he
was
staring
at
her
before
she
looked
away
her
eyes
said
to
him
why
do
you
care
like
do
those
things
mean
to
you
she
smiled
across
at
him
they
were
in
communion
again
as
they
had
been
last
night
he
was
surprised
that
he
should
be
so
glad

i
the
duchess
could
but
dimly
guess
at
the
splendour
of
that
fine
may
afternoon
it
had
been
her
complaint
lately
that
she
was
always
cold
and
now
the
blinds
and
curtains
were
closely
drawn
and
a
huge
fire
was
blazing
her
chair
was
close
to
the
flame
she
sat
there
looking
in
the
fierce
light
small
and
shrivelled
she
was
reading
intently
and
made
no
movement
except
now
and
again
when
she
turned
a
page
dorchester
was
the
only
other
person
there
and
she
sat
a
little
in
the
shadow
busily
sewing
from
where
she
sat
she
could
see
her
mistress
face
and
behind
her
carved
chair
there
were
the
blue
china
dragons
and
the
deep
heavy
red
curtains
and
a
black
oak
table
covered
with
little
golden
trays
and
glass
jars
and
silver
boxes
neither
heat
nor
cold
nor
youth
nor
age
had
any
effect
upon
dorchester
no
one
knew
how
old
she
was
nor
how
long
she
had
been
with
her
mistress
nor
her
opinions
or
sentiments
concerning
anything
in
the
world
she
was
tall
and
gaunt
and
snapped
her
words
as
she
might
snap
a
piece
of
thread
from
newton
and
norris
downwards
the
servants
were
afraid
of
her
she
made
a
confidant
of
no
one
was
supposed
to
have
no
emotions
of
any
kind
absurd
and
fantastic
stories
were
told
of
her
she
was
certainly
not
popular
in
the
servants
hall
and
yet
at
a
word
from
her
anything
that
she
requested
was
done
with
miss
rand
only
was
it
understood
that
she
had
a
certain
friendly
relationship
it
was
said
that
she
liked
miss
rand
dorchester
had
witnessed
the
whole
of
the
duchess
career
as
she
sat
now
in
the
shadow
every
now
and
again
she
looked
up
and
glanced
at
that
sharp
white
face
and
those
thin
hands
what
a
little
body
it
was
to
have
done
so
much
to
have
battled
its
way
through
such
a
career
to
have
fought
and
to
have
won
so
many
conflicts
it
seemed
to
dorchester
only
yesterday
that
splendid
time
when
the
duchess
had
been
queen
of
london
dorchester
also
had
been
young
then
and
had
had
an
energy
as
enduring
a
will
as
finely
tempered
as
had
her
mistress
what
a
character
it
had
been
then
with
its
furies
and
its
disciplines
its
indulgences
and
its
amazing
restrictions
its
sympathies
and
cold
clodded
cruelties
its
tremendous
sense
of
the
dramatic
moment
so
that
again
and
again
a
position
that
had
been
nearly
surrendered
was
held
and
saved
she
had
never
been
beautiful
always
little
and
sharp
and
sometimes
even
wizened
but
she
gained
her
effects
one
way
or
another
and
beat
beautiful
and
wise
and
wonderful
women
off
the
field
and
then
sweeping
down
upon
her
had
come
disease
at
first
it
had
been
fought
and
magnificently
fought
but
it
was
the
horror
of
its
unexpected
ravages
that
had
been
so
difficult
to
combat
she
had
never
known
when
the
pain
would
be
upon
her
it
might
seize
her
at
any
public
moment
and
her
retreat
be
compelled
before
the
whole
world
there
had
been
doctors
and
doctors
and
doctors
and
then
operation
after
operation
but
no
one
had
done
any
good
until
christopher
had
come
to
her
and
now
for
years
he
had
been
keeping
her
alive
out
of
that
very
necessity
of
disease
however
had
she
dragged
her
drama
she
had
retired
from
the
world
not
as
an
old
woman
beaten
by
pain
but
as
a
priestess
might
withdraw
within
her
sanctuary
or
some
great
queen
demand
her
privacy
and
it
had
its
effect
very
very
carefully
were
chosen
to
see
her
only
those
who
might
convey
to
the
world
the
right
impression
the
world
was
given
to
understand
that
the
duchess
was
now
more
wonderful
than
she
had
ever
been
and
it
was
so
long
since
the
world
at
large
had
seen
her
that
every
sort
of
story
was
abroad
certain
old
ladies
like
lady
carloes
who
played
bridge
with
her
gained
most
of
their
public
importance
from
their
intimacy
with
her
it
was
rumoured
that
at
any
moment
she
might
return
and
take
her
place
again
in
the
world
old
though
she
was
all
this
was
known
to
dorchester
and
she
smiled
grimly
as
she
thought
of
it
the
real
duchess
perhaps
she
and
christopher
alone
in
all
the
world
knew
the
intricacies
the
inconsistencies
of
that
amazing
figure
from
the
moment
that
illness
had
come
every
peculiarity
had
grown
her
her
temper
her
pride
her
egotism
now
knew
in
private
no
restraint
and
yet
when
her
friends
were
there
or
anyone
at
all
from
the
outside
world
she
displayed
the
old
dignity
the
old
grand
air
the
old
imperious
quiet
that
belonged
to
no
one
else
alive
but
what
during
these
last
years
lady
adela
had
suffered
dorchester
herself
had
had
many
moments
when
it
had
seemed
that
she
had
more
to
control
than
her
strength
could
maintain
but
long
custom
an
entire
absence
of
the
nervous
system
and
a
comforting
sense
that
she
was
after
all
paid
well
for
her
trouble
sustained
her
endurance
but
lady
adela
had
nothing
the
duchess
had
always
hated
her
children
but
had
used
them
magnificently
for
her
purposes
they
had
all
been
fools
but
they
were
just
the
kind
of
fools
that
the
beaminster
tradition
demanded
lady
adela
had
from
the
first
been
more
of
a
fool
than
the
others
she
had
never
had
the
gift
of
words
and
before
her
mother
was
as
a
rule
speechless
and
it
had
been
only
by
her
changing
colour
that
an
onlooker
could
have
told
that
her
mother
furies
moved
her
often
dorchester
had
attempted
interference
but
had
found
at
last
that
it
was
better
to
allow
the
fury
to
spend
its
force
then
also
dorchester
had
noticed
a
curious
thing
the
duke
lord
richard
lord
john
lady
adela
were
proud
of
these
prides
and
tempers
they
were
proud
of
everything
that
their
mother
did
they
might
suffer
their
backs
might
wince
under
the
blows
but
it
was
part
of
the
tradition
that
their
mother
should
thus
behave
dorchester
fancied
that
sometimes
there
was
flashed
upon
them
a
sudden
suspicion
that
their
mother
was
in
these
days
only
an
old
ailing
broken
woman
no
great
figure
now
no
magnificent
tyrant
no
mysterious
queen
of
society
and
then
dorchester
fancied
that
she
had
noticed
that
when
such
a
suspicion
had
come
upon
them
they
had
put
it
hastily
aside
and
locked
it
up
and
abused
themselves
for
such
baseness
curious
people
these
beaminsters
well
it
was
no
business
of
hers
and
perhaps
after
all
she
had
herself
some
touch
of
that
feeling
some
fierce
impatient
pride
in
those
very
tempests
and
rebellion
after
all
was
there
anyone
in
the
world
like
this
mistress
of
hers
was
there
another
woman
who
would
bear
so
bravely
the
pain
that
she
bore
and
was
not
that
fierce
clutch
on
life
that
energy
with
which
she
tried
still
to
play
her
part
in
the
great
game
grand
in
its
own
fashion
would
not
dorchester
also
fight
when
her
time
came
she
looked
across
the
firelight
at
her
mistress
when
would
arrive
the
inevitable
moment
of
surrender
how
imminent
that
moment
when
in
the
eyes
of
all
those
about
her
the
old
woman
would
see
that
all
that
was
now
hers
was
a
quiet
abandonment
to
death
well
there
would
be
some
fine
savage
struggling
when
that
crisis
struck
into
their
midst
dorchester
smiled
grimly
and
then
in
spite
of
herself
sighed
a
little
they
were
all
growing
old
together
ii
at
five
came
christopher
and
dorchester
moved
into
the
other
room
and
left
the
two
together
with
his
large
limbs
and
cheerful
smile
he
made
the
duchess
seem
slighter
and
more
fragile
than
ever
and
she
herself
felt
always
with
his
coming
some
addition
of
warmth
and
strength
each
visit
so
she
might
have
expressed
it
gave
her
life
for
at
least
another
tiny
span
that
he
knowing
so
much
of
the
follies
and
catastrophes
of
life
should
yet
be
an
optimist
would
have
proved
him
in
her
opinion
a
fool
had
she
not
known
by
constant
proof
that
he
was
anything
but
that
well
one
day
he
will
discover
his
mistake
she
would
say
and
yet
perversely
would
cling
to
him
for
the
sake
of
this
very
illusion
he
helped
her
courage
he
helped
her
battle
with
her
pain
he
gave
her
sometimes
some
shadowy
sense
of
shame
for
her
passions
and
rebellions
but
more
than
all
this
he
yielded
her
a
reassurance
that
life
precious
adorable
wonderful
life
was
yet
for
a
little
time
to
be
hers
he
knew
well
enough
the
influence
that
he
possessed
and
when
as
on
this
afternoon
he
felt
it
his
duty
to
avail
himself
of
it
he
could
not
pretend
that
he
faced
his
task
with
any
exultation
that
he
should
rouse
her
fury
as
he
had
one
or
twice
already
roused
it
meant
humiliation
for
him
as
well
as
for
herself
and
afterwards
embarrassment
for
them
both
as
they
saw
those
scenes
in
retrospect
she
glanced
up
at
him
carefully
as
he
came
in
and
knew
him
well
enough
to
realize
that
there
was
something
that
he
must
say
to
her
there
had
been
other
such
occasions
she
remembered
them
all
sometimes
she
herself
had
been
the
subject
of
them
something
that
was
injuring
her
health
some
indulgence
that
he
could
not
allow
her
sometimes
the
battle
had
been
about
others
she
had
fought
him
and
on
occasions
it
had
seemed
that
their
relationship
was
broken
once
and
for
all
that
nothing
could
cover
the
words
that
had
been
spoken
but
always
through
everything
she
had
admired
his
courage
the
way
had
always
been
to
stand
up
to
her
for
a
little
time
they
talked
about
her
health
and
then
there
fell
a
pause
she
leaning
back
in
her
chair
with
her
thin
sharp
hands
on
her
lap
watched
him
grimly
as
he
sat
on
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
leaning
forward
a
little
looking
into
the
fire
well
she
said
at
last
what
is
it
her
voice
was
deep
but
every
word
was
resonant
there
something
two
things
he
answered
her
slowly
you
can
dismiss
me
for
an
interfering
old
fool
you
know
you
often
have
been
tempted
to
do
it
before
i
dare
say
i
have
she
said
go
on
but
as
she
spoke
she
drew
her
hands
a
little
more
closely
together
she
was
not
quite
so
ready
for
these
battles
as
she
had
once
been
she
was
afraid
a
little
now
a
new
sensation
for
her
she
hated
that
restricting
awkwardness
that
would
remain
between
them
for
days
afterwards
she
looked
at
his
red
cheerful
face
and
wondered
impatiently
why
he
must
always
be
meddling
in
other
people
affairs
she
hated
quixotes
your
grace
he
began
again
has
only
got
to
stop
me
and
i
say
no
more
oh
yes
you
will
she
said
impatiently
i
know
you
say
what
you
please
i
want
to
speak
about
francis
breton
he
paused
but
she
said
nothing
only
for
an
instant
her
whole
face
flashed
into
stone
the
firelight
seemed
for
an
instant
to
hold
it
there
then
as
the
flame
fell
she
was
once
again
indifferent
christopher
had
grasped
his
courage
now
he
went
on
gravely
i
must
speak
about
him
i
know
how
unpleasant
the
whole
subject
is
to
you
we
had
our
discussions
before
and
i
fought
his
battles
with
all
the
world
more
times
than
i
can
count
you
must
remember
that
known
frank
all
his
life
i
knew
his
unhappy
father
i
known
them
both
long
enough
to
realize
that
the
boy
been
heavily
handicapped
from
the
beginning
must
you
she
said
looking
him
now
full
in
the
face
must
it
be
this
have
we
not
thrashed
it
out
thoroughly
enough
already
i
change
you
know
he
understood
that
she
was
appealing
to
his
regard
for
their
own
especial
relationship
but
there
was
a
note
of
control
in
her
voice
he
knew
that
now
she
would
listen
i
cared
for
frank
during
a
number
of
years
i
know
he
weak
impulsive
incredibly
foolish
he
always
been
his
own
worst
enemy
i
know
that
the
other
day
he
wrote
a
most
foolish
letter
it
was
a
letter
beyond
forgiveness
she
said
her
voice
trembling
yes
i
would
give
anything
to
have
prevented
it
i
know
that
when
he
was
in
england
before
i
pleaded
for
him
as
i
am
doing
now
and
that
by
a
thousand
foolhardy
actions
he
negatived
anything
that
i
could
say
for
him
i
urging
no
defence
for
the
things
that
he
did
the
shady
disreputable
things
but
he
has
come
back
now
i
do
verily
believe
ready
even
eager
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
i
she
interrupted
him
smiling
yes
that
letter
oh
i
know
but
is
it
a
very
proof
of
what
i
say
would
anyone
but
a
foolhardy
boy
have
done
such
a
thing
sheer
bravado
hoping
behind
it
all
to
be
taken
back
to
the
fold
eager
at
any
rate
not
to
show
a
poor
spirit
cowardice
over
thirty
now
old
for
a
boy
in
years
yes
but
younger
oh
ages
younger
than
that
in
spirit
in
knowledge
of
the
world
in
everything
that
matters
i
know
he
went
on
more
slowly
smiling
a
little
that
you
called
me
sentimentalist
times
without
number
but
really
here
i
not
urging
you
to
anything
from
sentimental
reasons
i
not
asking
you
to
take
him
back
and
kill
the
fatted
calf
for
him
i
asking
nothing
absurd
only
that
you
his
relations
all
that
he
has
of
kith
and
kin
should
not
be
his
enemies
should
not
drive
him
to
desperation
and
worse
if
you
imagine
she
said
steadily
that
his
fate
is
of
the
smallest
concern
to
me
you
know
me
very
little
i
care
nothing
of
what
becomes
of
him
he
and
i
have
been
enemies
for
many
years
now
and
a
few
words
from
you
can
not
change
that
i
only
asking
you
he
replied
to
give
him
a
chance
see
what
you
can
make
of
him
instead
of
sending
him
into
the
other
camp
use
him
even
if
you
can
not
care
for
him
there
fine
stuff
there
in
spite
of
his
follies
the
day
might
come
even
now
when
you
will
own
yourself
proud
of
him
but
she
had
caught
him
up
leaning
forward
a
little
her
voice
now
of
a
sharper
turn
the
other
camp
what
other
camp
he
caught
the
note
of
danger
i
only
mean
he
said
choosing
now
his
words
with
the
greatest
care
that
if
you
turn
frank
definitely
once
and
for
all
from
your
doors
there
may
be
others
ready
to
receive
him
his
men
and
his
women
she
broke
in
scornfully
do
i
know
them
i
not
lived
these
years
without
knowing
the
raffish
lot
that
failures
like
frank
breton
affect
no
there
are
others
christopher
said
firmly
bronson
for
instance
at
that
name
she
broke
in
yes
exactly
bronson
oh
i
know
the
kind
of
crowd
that
bronson
and
her
like
can
gather
they
are
welcome
to
francis
and
he
to
them
she
paused
he
saw
that
she
was
controlling
herself
with
a
great
effort
for
a
little
while
there
was
silence
and
then
she
went
on
more
quietly
there
now
you
have
it
that
is
why
there
can
never
be
any
truce
between
francis
and
myself
it
is
more
than
francis
it
is
all
the
things
that
he
stands
for
all
the
things
that
will
soon
make
england
a
rubbish
heap
for
every
dirty
foreigner
to
dump
his
filth
on
to
hate
him
why
i
fight
him
and
all
that
he
stands
for
so
long
as
breath
in
my
body
but
frank
is
with
you
christopher
urged
eagerly
if
you
let
him
be
he
only
in
need
of
your
hand
and
back
he
come
he
waiting
there
now
longing
in
spite
of
his
defiance
for
a
word
give
him
it
and
in
the
end
i
know
as
surely
as
i
sit
here
that
he
be
worth
your
while
what
can
he
do
for
me
ah
he
show
you
after
all
he
is
one
of
the
family
he
miserable
there
in
his
exile
he
got
your
own
spirit
he
die
rather
than
own
to
defeat
but
he
repay
you
if
you
have
him
he
saw
then
as
she
turned
towards
him
that
he
had
done
no
good
listen
she
said
i
heard
you
fairly
let
us
leave
this
now
once
and
for
all
i
tell
you
finally
no
word
that
god
almighty
could
speak
on
this
business
could
change
me
one
atom
francis
breton
and
i
are
foes
for
all
time
i
hate
not
only
himself
and
the
miserable
mess
that
made
of
his
life
i
hate
all
this
new
generation
that
he
stands
for
i
hate
these
new
opinions
i
hate
this
indulgence
now
towards
everything
that
any
fool
in
the
country
may
choose
to
think
or
say
in
my
day
we
knew
how
to
use
the
fools
took
advantage
of
their
muddle
ran
the
world
on
it
i
loathe
this
tendency
to
make
everyone
as
intelligent
as
they
can
be
why
in
god
name
give
me
two
intelligent
men
and
a
dozen
fools
and
you
get
something
done
take
a
wastrel
like
frank
and
turn
him
out
take
muddlers
like
my
family
and
keep
muddled
richard
ran
the
country
well
enough
for
a
time
or
two
and
he
been
a
muddler
from
his
childhood
all
this
cry
to
educate
the
people
to
be
kind
to
thieves
and
murderers
to
help
the
fools
my
god
if
i
still
had
my
say
whilst
there
breath
in
me
i
fight
the
lot
of
them
she
leant
back
in
her
chair
waited
for
breath
and
then
went
on
more
mildly
you
may
like
all
this
noise
and
clamour
doctor
you
may
like
your
bronson
and
the
rest
common
vulgar
brainless
ruling
the
world
every
decent
law
that
held
society
together
is
being
broken
and
nobody
cares
frank
breton
may
find
his
place
in
this
new
world
he
has
no
place
in
mine
then
she
added
so
much
for
that
what
the
other
thing
but
he
hesitated
her
voice
was
tired
even
tremulous
and
he
was
aware
as
he
looked
across
at
her
that
her
emotions
now
treated
her
more
severely
than
they
had
once
done
at
the
same
time
he
was
aware
that
giving
free
play
to
her
temper
always
did
her
good
well
perhaps
another
day
no
now
i
may
as
well
take
my
scoldings
together
it
saves
time
he
stood
up
and
leaning
on
the
mantelpiece
with
one
arm
looked
down
upon
her
here
he
said
i
afraid
i
may
seem
doubly
impertinent
but
it
a
matter
that
is
closer
to
me
than
anything
in
the
world
you
know
that
i
a
lonely
old
bachelor
and
that
all
those
sentiments
that
you
accuse
me
of
must
find
some
vent
somewhere
i
fonder
of
rachel
i
think
than
i
am
of
anyone
in
the
world
and
it
only
that
affection
and
the
feeling
that
in
some
ways
i
know
her
better
than
any
of
you
do
that
give
me
courage
to
speak
he
could
see
that
now
she
was
reaching
the
limits
of
her
patience
well
what
of
rachel
i
understand
i
know
that
you
that
all
of
you
intend
that
she
shall
marry
young
seddon
well
i
know
that
it
is
impertinent
of
me
but
as
i
have
said
i
think
i
know
rachel
differently
from
anyone
else
in
the
world
she
is
strange
curiously
ignorant
of
life
in
many
ways
curiously
wise
in
others
her
simplicity
the
things
that
she
takes
on
trust
there
is
no
end
to
it
the
things
too
that
she
can
not
forgive
she
does
know
how
often
later
on
she
will
have
to
forgive
them
but
the
first
man
who
breaks
her
trust
thank
you
for
this
interesting
light
on
rachel
character
what
does
it
mean
it
means
he
said
abruptly
that
she
must
be
hurt
your
grace
may
turn
me
out
of
the
house
here
and
now
if
you
will
but
seddon
is
the
wrong
man
for
her
to
marry
what
are
his
crimes
her
voice
was
rising
and
her
hand
tapped
impatiently
on
her
dress
i
know
him
only
slightly
but
common
repute
anyone
who
is
in
the
london
world
at
all
will
tell
you
his
reputation
is
bad
i
nothing
against
him
myself
but
his
affairs
with
women
have
been
many
he
is
no
worse
i
dare
say
than
a
thousand
others
at
least
he
young
and
i
myself
god
knows
am
no
moralist
but
to
marry
him
to
rachel
will
be
a
crime
he
knew
as
he
heard
his
own
voice
drop
that
the
scene
that
he
dreaded
was
upon
him
the
air
was
charged
with
it
in
the
strangest
way
everything
in
the
room
seemed
to
be
changed
because
of
it
the
furniture
the
dragons
the
tables
the
very
trifles
of
gold
and
silver
seemed
to
withdraw
leaving
the
air
weighted
with
passion
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
her
voice
was
very
low
you
gone
too
far
what
business
is
this
of
yours
how
dare
you
come
to
me
with
these
tales
how
dare
you
you
taken
too
much
on
your
shoulders
see
to
your
own
house
doctor
he
stepped
back
from
the
fireplace
please
no
here
and
now
her
words
flashed
at
him
you
begun
to
think
yourself
indispensable
because
i
shown
you
that
i
rely
upon
you
because
at
times
i
seemed
to
need
your
aid
therefore
interfered
in
matters
that
are
no
concern
of
yours
they
are
concerns
of
mine
he
answered
firmly
in
so
far
as
this
affair
is
connected
with
my
friend
your
friend
and
my
granddaughter
she
retorted
but
it
is
not
only
that
i
will
return
you
your
own
words
you
say
that
your
friend
is
in
danger
what
of
mine
you
have
dared
to
attack
someone
who
is
more
to
me
than
you
and
all
the
rest
of
the
world
put
together
someone
whom
i
care
for
as
i
have
never
cared
for
my
own
sons
it
was
bold
of
you
christopher
and
i
shall
not
forget
it
he
took
it
without
flinching
very
well
he
said
but
my
word
to
the
end
is
the
same
if
you
marry
seddon
to
your
granddaughter
you
do
your
own
sense
of
justice
wrong
at
that
the
last
vestige
of
restraint
left
her
leaning
forward
in
her
chair
she
poured
her
words
upon
him
in
a
torrent
of
anger
her
voice
was
not
raised
but
her
words
cut
the
air
and
now
and
again
she
raised
her
hands
in
a
movement
of
furious
protest
she
spared
him
nothing
dragged
forward
old
incidents
old
passages
between
them
that
he
had
thought
long
ago
forgotten
reminded
him
of
occasions
when
he
had
been
mistaken
or
accused
him
of
crimes
that
would
have
caused
him
to
leave
the
country
had
there
been
a
vestige
of
truth
in
her
words
at
last
beaten
for
breath
gasped
out
sir
roderick
seddon
shall
know
of
what
you
accuse
him
he
shall
deal
with
you
i
have
nothing
christopher
answered
gravely
against
seddon
nothing
except
that
he
should
not
marry
rachel
you
have
attacked
him
she
gasped
out
he
shall
answer
but
her
rage
had
exhausted
her
she
lay
back
against
her
chair
heaving
clutching
at
the
arms
for
support
he
summoned
dorchester
but
when
he
approached
the
duchess
feebly
motioned
him
away
i
done
with
you
never
again
she
murmured
she
seemed
then
most
desperately
old
her
dress
was
in
disorder
her
face
wizened
with
deep
lines
beneath
her
eyes
and
hollows
in
her
cheeks
christopher
waited
while
dorchester
helped
her
mistress
into
the
farther
room
for
some
time
there
was
silence
the
room
was
stifling
and
impatiently
he
pulled
back
the
heavy
red
curtains
he
sat
waiting
eyeing
the
stupid
dragons
every
now
and
again
glancing
at
his
watch
even
now
the
room
seemed
to
vibrate
with
her
voice
and
he
could
imagine
that
the
french
novel
fallen
from
her
lap
on
to
the
carpet
winked
at
him
as
much
as
to
say
oh
we
up
to
her
tempers
are
we
we
know
what
they
worth
do
care
at
last
dorchester
appeared
her
grace
is
in
bed
and
will
see
you
sir
she
said
her
face
was
grave
and
without
expression
after
another
glance
at
his
watch
he
passed
into
the
bedroom
chapter
viii
the
tiger
for
every
manne
there
lurketh
hys
wilde
beast
sardus
aquinas
i
brun
meeting
christopher
one
day
had
asked
him
to
tea
in
his
flat
and
then
remembering
his
interest
in
the
beaminster
history
invited
him
to
bring
breton
with
him
i
have
seen
him
for
years
i
like
to
see
him
again
christopher
had
accepted
this
invitation
and
now
on
a
sultry
afternoon
in
june
found
himself
sitting
in
brun
rooms
brun
had
a
glazed
and
mathematical
appearance
as
though
from
cushions
to
ceiling
it
had
been
purchased
at
a
handsome
price
from
a
handsome
warehouse
it
was
not
comfortable
it
was
very
hot
the
narrow
street
squeezed
between
portland
square
and
great
portland
street
lay
on
its
back
the
little
windows
of
its
mean
houses
gasping
like
mouths
for
air
the
hard
sun
pouring
pitilessly
down
no
weather
nor
atmosphere
ever
affected
brun
his
clothes
as
well
as
his
body
had
that
definite
appearance
of
something
outside
change
or
disorder
he
might
have
been
one
would
allow
something
else
at
earlier
stages
before
this
final
result
had
been
achieved
as
a
painting
is
presented
to
the
observer
before
its
completion
but
surely
now
nothing
would
ever
be
done
to
him
again
surveying
him
he
appeared
less
a
man
with
a
history
origins
destinies
about
him
than
an
opinion
or
a
criticism
he
was
designed
exactly
by
nature
for
cynical
observation
and
was
intended
to
play
no
other
part
in
life
well
christopher
said
brun
hot
is
it
my
word
yes
breton
coming
along
presently
good
i
asked
arkwright
the
explorer
nice
fellow
they
sat
in
silence
for
a
little
then
brun
said
interested
in
writers
christopher
not
very
much
why
just
been
lunching
with
a
young
novelist
westcott
what
he
said
interested
me
of
course
he
very
young
got
no
humour
takes
himself
dreadfully
seriously
but
he
asked
my
advice
and
it
is
as
a
sign
of
the
times
over
here
that
i
mention
it
go
ahead
he
tells
me
that
a
number
of
young
novelists
are
going
to
band
themselves
into
a
kind
of
artists
young
liberty
movement
artists
poets
novelists
some
thirty
altogether
going
to
have
a
magazine
do
all
kinds
of
things
some
of
the
older
men
will
scoff
at
the
same
time
well
said
christopher
they
asked
him
to
join
he
wanted
my
opinion
what
did
you
say
he
interested
me
he
was
a
kind
of
test
case
it
would
mean
that
commercially
from
the
popular
point
of
view
it
would
put
him
back
for
years
those
young
men
will
all
be
put
down
as
conceited
cranks
they
will
tilt
at
the
successful
popular
men
like
lawson
and
the
others
will
worship
at
the
feet
of
the
unsuccessful
men
like
lester
and
cotton
the
papers
will
hate
the
public
will
be
indifferent
the
result
will
be
that
in
the
end
they
may
do
a
big
thing
at
any
rate
they
have
done
a
fine
thing
but
they
all
die
on
the
way
i
expect
brun
spoke
with
enthusiasm
unusual
for
him
how
was
this
a
test
of
westcott
asked
christopher
well
would
he
go
or
no
he
at
the
kind
of
parting
of
the
ways
i
believe
success
is
coming
to
him
if
he
wants
it
but
he
have
to
build
another
wall
in
front
of
his
tiger
either
before
the
success
or
after
if
he
joins
this
crowd
of
men
there
be
no
walls
for
him
ever
again
christopher
knew
that
when
brun
had
some
idea
that
he
was
pleasantly
pursuing
and
had
secured
an
audience
nothing
would
stay
or
hinder
him
he
pushed
a
chair
towards
him
what
do
you
mean
by
your
tiger
he
asked
my
tiger
is
what
every
man
has
within
him
i
do
mean
you
know
a
nasty
habit
or
a
degrading
passion
or
anything
of
necessity
vicious
only
my
theory
is
that
every
man
is
given
at
the
outset
of
life
a
beast
in
the
finest
noblest
sense
with
whom
through
life
he
has
got
to
settle
it
may
be
an
ambition
or
a
passion
or
a
temptation
or
a
virtue
what
you
will
but
with
that
beast
he
got
to
live
now
according
to
his
dealings
with
the
beast
that
the
man
great
or
no
if
he
faces
the
beast
and
the
beast
is
generally
something
that
a
man
knows
about
himself
that
nobody
else
knows
the
beast
can
be
used
magnificently
used
if
he
afraid
pretends
the
tiger
is
there
builds
up
walls
hides
in
cities
does
what
you
will
then
he
must
be
prepared
for
a
life
of
incessant
alarm
and
he
may
be
sure
that
at
some
moment
or
another
the
tiger
will
make
his
spring
then
there
be
a
crisis
over
here
in
england
you
hiding
your
tigers
all
the
time
that
why
you
muddled
about
art
literature
government
everything
that
matters
and
an
old
woman
like
the
duchess
of
wrexe
sharp
enough
herself
mind
you
uses
all
of
you
no
beaminster
has
ever
faced
his
or
her
tiger
yet
and
they
down
like
knives
on
everyone
who
does
and
everything
that
shows
the
bright
eyes
but
i
see
oh
lord
i
see
a
time
coming
yes
here
in
england
when
the
individual
the
great
man
is
coming
through
when
the
duchess
will
be
dead
and
the
beaminster
driven
from
power
and
every
man
with
his
tiger
there
in
front
of
him
faced
and
trained
will
have
his
chance
more
brain
more
courage
no
muddle
god
help
the
day
you
see
things
moving
everywhere
everywhere
these
fellows
randall
and
the
rest
are
bringing
their
tigers
with
they
going
to
put
them
there
for
all
the
world
to
see
it
only
another
party
out
against
the
duchess
wants
all
the
tigers
hidden
only
herself
to
know
about
them
then
she
can
do
her
work
she
hate
these
fellows
until
they
made
their
stand
and
then
she
try
to
adopt
them
in
order
to
muzzle
them
the
better
in
the
end
if
westcott
hides
his
tiger
forgets
he
there
his
way
plain
enough
he
make
money
the
duchess
will
ask
him
to
tea
let
him
join
these
fellows
and
his
tiger
may
tear
all
his
present
self
to
pieces
what
about
yourself
brun
oh
i
nothing
i
the
one
great
exception
no
tiger
thinks
me
worth
while
i
merely
observe
i
do
feel
and
you
have
to
feel
to
keep
your
tiger
alive
brun
little
lecture
was
over
he
suddenly
drew
his
body
together
clapped
his
mental
hands
to
dismiss
the
whole
thing
and
was
drawing
westcott
to
the
door
but
i
talk
how
i
talk
you
bear
with
me
christopher
because
i
must
go
on
you
know
it
means
nothing
absolutely
nothing
but
they
will
have
arrived
now
so
down
we
go
i
go
on
in
my
sleep
exactly
the
same
and
now
tea
and
i
will
talk
less
because
breton
talks
a
great
deal
and
so
does
arkwright
and
so
do
you
ii
arkwright
came
and
after
a
little
breton
but
the
meeting
was
not
a
success
arkwright
had
heard
a
good
deal
about
breton
reputation
and
although
on
the
whole
he
was
tolerant
of
any
backsliding
in
women
he
made
what
he
called
his
liking
for
clean
men
an
excuse
for
much
it
is
quite
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
living
in
solitude
and
danger
makes
a
human
being
tolerant
it
has
the
precisely
opposite
effect
arkwright
was
more
frightened
of
a
man
who
was
not
quite
right
with
society
than
of
any
number
of
enraged
natives
with
natives
one
knew
where
one
was
whereas
with
a
man
like
this
breton
anxious
to
please
made
the
mistake
of
showing
his
anxiety
seeing
an
enemy
round
every
corner
he
was
a
little
theatrical
too
demonstrative
too
foreign
arkwright
disliked
his
beard
and
the
movement
of
his
hands
he
would
have
come
had
he
known
breton
had
of
course
at
once
perceived
this
man
hostility
returning
to
england
had
involved
as
he
had
known
that
it
must
a
life
of
battles
skirmishes
retreats
wounds
and
every
kind
of
hostility
people
did
not
forget
and
even
had
they
desired
to
do
so
his
relationship
family
history
prevented
breton
oblivion
he
was
ready
for
discourtesy
however
eager
he
may
have
been
for
friendship
but
what
the
devil
he
thought
is
this
fellow
doing
here
at
all
if
brun
brought
him
in
he
must
have
told
him
just
whom
he
was
to
meet
and
if
he
came
with
that
knowledge
about
him
why
then
should
he
not
behave
like
a
gentleman
breton
half
timid
advance
towards
friendliness
now
yielded
to
curt
hostility
brun
maintained
his
silence
and
only
watched
the
two
men
with
an
amusement
just
concealed
conversation
at
last
ceased
and
the
heat
beat
in
waves
through
the
open
windows
and
the
air
seemed
now
to
be
stiffened
into
bronze
beyond
the
room
all
the
city
lay
waiting
for
the
cool
of
the
evening
christopher
liked
arkwright
and
arkwright
liked
christopher
christopher
had
read
one
of
arkwright
books
and
spoke
of
it
with
praise
and
also
intelligence
and
nothing
goes
to
an
author
heart
like
intelligent
appreciation
from
an
unbiassed
critic
but
breton
was
not
to
be
won
over
he
sat
deep
in
his
chair
and
replied
in
sulky
monosyllables
whenever
he
was
addressed
christopher
soon
gave
him
up
and
the
three
men
talked
amongst
themselves
the
heat
of
the
afternoon
passed
and
a
little
breeze
danced
into
the
room
and
the
hard
brightness
of
the
sky
changed
to
a
pale
primrose
that
had
still
some
echo
of
the
blue
in
its
faint
colour
the
city
had
uttered
no
sound
through
the
heat
of
the
day
but
now
voices
came
up
to
the
windows
the
distant
crying
of
papers
the
call
of
some
man
with
flowers
then
the
bells
of
the
round
church
began
to
ring
for
evensong
breton
sat
there
wrapped
in
sulky
discontent
in
his
heart
he
was
wretched
christopher
had
deserted
him
these
men
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
as
was
his
nature
everything
about
him
was
exaggerated
he
had
come
to
brun
rooms
that
afternoon
feeling
that
men
had
taken
him
back
to
their
citizenship
again
now
he
was
more
urgently
assured
of
his
ostracism
than
before
who
were
these
men
to
give
themselves
these
airs
because
he
had
made
one
slip
were
they
to
constitute
themselves
his
judges
these
beaminster
virtues
again
the
trail
of
his
family
at
every
step
that
same
damnable
hypocrisy
that
same
priggish
assumption
of
the
right
to
judge
better
to
die
in
the
society
of
those
friends
of
his
who
had
suffered
as
he
had
done
from
the
judgment
of
the
world
no
scorn
of
sinners
there
no
failure
in
all
sense
of
true
proportion
christopher
got
up
to
go
he
gave
arkwright
his
card
come
in
and
dine
one
night
and
tell
me
all
you
doing
of
course
i
come
arkwright
said
only
you
much
too
busy
indeed
no
said
christopher
one
day
next
week
you
hear
from
me
breton
got
up
i
come
with
you
he
said
to
christopher
the
two
men
went
away
together
when
they
were
gone
arkwright
said
to
brun
now
that
the
kind
of
man
i
like
yes
said
brun
laughing
better
than
the
other
fellow
eh
arkwright
smiled
more
my
sort
i
must
confess
iii
christopher
and
breton
did
not
speak
until
they
reached
oxford
circus
here
everything
omnibuses
grey
buildings
grimy
men
and
women
was
drowned
in
purple
shadow
it
might
be
only
a
moment
beauty
but
now
beneath
the
evening
star
frosted
silver
and
alone
in
a
blue
heaven
sound
advanced
and
receded
with
the
quiet
rhythm
of
water
over
sand
for
an
instant
a
black
figure
of
an
omnibus
stood
against
the
blue
and
held
all
the
swell
the
glow
the
stir
at
a
fixed
point
then
life
was
once
more
distributed
here
as
they
turned
down
oxford
street
christopher
broke
silence
he
put
his
arm
through
breton
well
frank
sulks
not
over
yet
breton
broke
away
it
all
very
well
but
i
suppose
i
to
pretend
that
i
like
being
insulted
by
any
kind
of
fool
who
happens
to
turn
up
good
god
chris
you
think
i
was
a
child
by
the
way
you
talk
to
me
and
so
you
are
a
child
said
christopher
impatiently
and
a
thankless
child
too
sometimes
i
wonder
why
i
keep
on
bothering
with
you
christopher
was
like
other
scotchmen
a
curious
mixture
of
amiability
and
irascibility
his
temper
came
from
his
pride
and
breton
had
learnt
many
years
ago
to
fear
it
in
fact
of
all
the
things
in
life
that
he
disliked
doing
quarrelling
with
christopher
was
the
most
agreeable
then
there
were
stubbornness
and
tenacity
that
were
hard
indeed
to
deal
with
but
he
was
reckless
the
heat
of
the
afternoon
and
now
the
beauty
of
the
evening
had
both
in
their
different
ways
contributed
to
his
he
knew
even
now
that
afterwards
he
would
regret
every
word
that
he
uttered
but
he
let
his
temper
go
i
wonder
that
you
do
bother
he
said
let
me
alone
and
let
me
find
my
own
way
do
be
a
fool
christopher
answered
there
nothing
in
the
world
for
us
to
quarrel
about
only
i
ca
bear
to
see
you
giving
such
a
wrong
impression
of
yourself
to
strangers
sulking
there
as
though
you
were
five
years
old
all
very
well
retorted
breton
you
did
hear
the
way
that
fellow
insulted
me
i
wring
his
neck
if
i
meet
him
again
i
now
enough
of
that
christopher
voice
was
stern
you
know
quite
well
frank
that
you
hardly
in
a
position
to
wring
anyone
neck
you
remember
the
account
i
gave
you
of
my
little
dispute
with
your
grandmother
thank
you
said
breton
fiercely
you
remind
me
rather
frequently
of
the
kind
things
you
do
for
me
and
all
the
time
something
in
him
was
whispering
to
him
a
fool
you
are
to
talk
like
this
christopher
voice
now
was
cold
that
hardly
fair
of
you
turning
up
here
they
paused
breton
looked
away
from
him
up
into
the
quiet
blue
recesses
of
the
side
street
christopher
went
on
i
only
mean
that
if
i
were
you
i
should
drop
hanging
on
to
the
skirts
of
a
family
who
do
want
you
i
should
set
about
and
get
some
work
to
do
cut
all
those
rotten
people
you
go
about
with
and
behave
decently
to
strangers
when
you
meet
them
that
all
good
night
and
christopher
was
gone
breton
stood
there
for
a
moment
with
the
tide
of
his
misery
full
upon
him
then
he
turned
down
oxford
street
and
drove
his
way
through
the
crowds
of
people
who
were
coming
up
towards
the
circus
he
was
alone
utterly
alone
in
all
the
world
everyone
else
had
a
home
to
go
to
he
alone
had
nowhere
only
a
few
weeks
ago
he
had
come
back
to
england
with
money
enough
to
keep
him
alive
and
a
fine
burning
passion
of
revenge
that
family
of
his
should
lament
the
day
of
his
birth
that
old
woman
should
be
down
on
her
knees
begging
his
mercy
now
how
cold
and
wasted
was
that
revenge
what
a
fool
was
he
wincing
at
the
of
a
stranger
quarrelling
with
the
best
friend
man
ever
had
how
evilly
could
life
desert
a
man
and
kill
him
with
loneliness
and
then
his
mood
changed
if
christopher
and
the
rest
intended
to
cast
him
off
let
them
there
were
his
old
friends
men
and
women
who
had
been
ostracized
by
the
world
as
he
had
been
they
would
know
how
to
treat
him
he
turned
into
the
silence
and
peace
of
saxton
square
and
there
met
miss
rand
who
was
also
walking
home
the
statue
was
wrapped
in
blue
mist
the
trees
were
fading
into
grey
and
the
evening
star
seemed
to
have
taken
saxton
square
under
its
special
protection
good
evening
miss
rand
good
evening
mr
breton
is
it
a
lovely
evening
yes
but
it
been
hot
miss
rand
did
not
look
as
though
she
could
ever
under
any
possible
circumstances
be
hot
so
neat
and
cool
was
she
but
she
said
yes
it
had
been
is
it
odd
the
way
that
as
soon
as
it
fine
people
begin
to
complain
just
as
they
do
when
it
wet
it
gives
them
something
to
talk
about
just
as
it
giving
us
something
now
said
miss
rand
laughing
breton
looked
at
her
and
liked
her
she
seemed
so
strong
and
wise
and
safe
she
would
surely
always
give
one
the
kind
of
sensible
encouragement
that
one
needed
she
would
be
a
good
person
in
whom
to
confide
they
were
on
the
top
doorstep
now
no
i
got
a
key
he
let
her
pass
him
they
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
hall
together
he
spoke
as
he
always
did
on
the
instant
inspiration
miss
rand
yes
i
alone
such
a
lot
in
my
evenings
i
mean
i
wonder
might
i
come
down
sometimes
and
just
talk
a
little
you
do
know
how
bad
thinking
too
much
is
for
me
and
if
i
might
why
of
course
breton
whenever
you
like
seeing
her
now
he
thought
just
now
with
her
sudden
colour
she
looked
quite
pretty
i
expect
you
could
advise
me
help
me
in
lots
of
ways
if
there
anything
mother
or
i
can
do
breton
you
only
got
to
ask
good
night
the
door
closed
behind
her
he
went
up
to
his
room
a
less
miserable
man
chapter
ix
the
golden
cage
she
gives
away
because
she
overflows
she
has
her
own
feelings
her
own
standards
she
does
keep
remembering
that
she
must
be
proud
lesson
of
the
i
those
weeks
were
to
rachel
a
golden
time
she
did
not
pretend
to
deny
or
examine
their
golden
quality
they
were
far
far
better
than
she
had
imagined
anything
could
ever
be
and
that
was
enough
she
had
never
very
definitely
imagined
to
herself
this
coming
out
but
it
had
been
at
any
rate
behind
its
possible
glories
a
period
of
terror
all
those
people
was
the
way
that
with
frightened
eyes
she
had
contemplated
it
and
now
the
kindness
that
there
had
been
all
the
london
world
had
surely
nothing
to
do
but
to
pay
her
compliments
to
surround
her
with
courtesies
to
flatter
her
every
wish
even
aunt
adela
had
under
the
general
enthusiasm
blossomed
a
little
into
even
uncle
richard
had
remembered
to
wish
her
well
even
the
duke
had
cracked
applause
and
as
for
uncle
john
he
was
like
an
amiable
conjurer
whose
best
and
also
most
difficult
trick
had
achieved
an
absolute
triumph
and
behind
all
this
there
was
more
may
june
and
the
early
part
of
july
showered
such
weather
upon
london
as
had
surely
never
been
showered
before
and
these
brilliant
days
dressed
for
rachel
her
brilliant
success
in
cloth
of
gold
and
emblazoned
robes
she
felt
the
presence
of
london
for
the
first
time
as
the
hot
weather
came
beating
up
the
streets
and
the
brilliant
whites
and
blues
and
greens
and
reds
flung
back
to
the
burning
blue
their
contrast
and
splendour
she
felt
for
the
first
time
her
own
especial
london
and
now
the
grey
cool
cluster
of
buildings
at
one
end
of
blazing
portland
place
and
the
dark
green
of
the
hovering
park
at
the
other
end
had
a
new
meaning
for
her
as
though
she
had
only
just
come
to
live
here
and
was
seeing
it
all
for
the
first
time
in
the
streets
that
hung
about
portland
place
she
noticed
little
shops
little
bakers
and
little
shoemakers
and
little
tailors
and
little
sweetshops
and
they
were
all
furtive
and
dark
and
shabby
and
these
little
shops
led
to
the
growth
in
her
mind
of
an
especial
picture
of
her
square
of
london
life
portland
place
white
and
shining
in
the
middle
with
the
circus
like
a
fair
at
one
end
of
it
the
park
like
a
mystery
at
the
other
end
of
it
and
on
either
side
little
secret
shops
and
little
dim
squares
hanging
about
it
and
harley
street
sinister
and
ominous
by
its
side
every
element
of
life
and
death
was
there
the
whole
history
of
journey
through
this
world
to
the
next
behind
all
the
joy
and
overflowing
happiness
of
these
weeks
this
sudden
setting
of
london
about
her
was
consciously
present
ii
since
that
meeting
with
miss
rand
on
the
day
before
the
ball
rachel
had
often
spoken
to
her
they
met
at
first
by
accident
and
then
rachel
had
gone
to
lizzie
neat
little
to
ask
for
something
and
after
that
had
looked
in
for
five
minutes
or
so
and
they
had
talked
very
pleasantly
about
the
hot
weather
and
the
theatres
and
the
ways
of
the
world
behind
all
the
splendour
there
was
for
rachel
the
dark
shadow
of
suspense
was
it
going
to
last
what
was
to
follow
it
when
would
those
awkward
uncertainties
that
had
once
kept
her
company
return
to
her
now
whatever
else
might
be
doubtful
about
miss
rand
one
thing
was
certain
that
she
last
would
remain
to
the
end
the
same
clean
reliable
honest
person
that
she
was
now
imagine
lizzie
rand
unreliable
and
she
vanishes
altogether
rachel
welcomed
this
and
she
also
admired
the
wonderful
manner
in
which
miss
rand
accomplished
her
gigantic
task
to
run
a
house
like
this
one
and
at
the
end
of
it
all
to
remain
as
composed
and
safe
as
though
nothing
had
been
done
rachel
herself
might
carry
off
a
difficult
situation
by
riding
desperately
at
it
stringing
her
resources
to
their
highest
pitch
but
afterwards
reaction
would
claim
its
penalty
the
penalties
were
never
claimed
from
miss
rand
so
gradually
without
any
definite
words
or
events
almost
without
active
consciousness
they
became
friends
rachel
suddenly
on
one
afternoon
early
in
july
determined
to
go
and
pay
lizzie
rand
a
visit
in
her
house
that
house
in
saxton
square
had
acquired
a
new
romantic
interest
since
rachel
had
learnt
that
the
abandoned
abominable
cousin
who
defied
grandmamma
and
whose
name
one
was
never
to
mention
lived
there
rachel
had
considered
this
cousin
more
than
once
during
these
last
months
she
had
resented
from
the
first
the
fact
that
he
was
to
be
given
by
the
family
no
chance
of
redemption
however
bad
he
had
been
and
he
had
apparently
been
very
bad
indeed
his
opportunity
should
have
been
offered
to
him
his
life
she
knew
had
been
hard
he
was
like
herself
an
orphan
and
he
hated
as
she
did
her
grandmother
of
course
then
he
interested
her
she
did
not
now
say
to
herself
that
if
this
romantic
cousin
had
not
been
staying
in
that
house
she
would
not
have
contemplated
a
visit
to
lizzie
the
beaminster
in
her
had
just
now
the
upper
hand
and
the
beaminster
simply
said
that
saxton
square
would
be
a
nice
place
in
which
uncle
john
who
was
this
afternoon
taking
her
out
for
a
drive
might
leave
her
whilst
he
went
to
the
club
later
he
could
pick
her
up
and
take
her
home
the
beaminster
part
of
her
did
not
acknowledge
the
cousin
quite
casually
she
said
to
uncle
john
i
want
you
to
leave
me
at
miss
rand
for
half
an
hour
this
afternoon
she
is
helping
me
about
some
clothes
now
uncle
john
had
during
these
last
weeks
continually
congratulated
himself
on
the
disappearance
of
rachel
irritable
unsettled
self
always
lately
one
had
been
presented
with
her
delightful
young
eager
self
and
always
she
had
been
anxious
to
agree
with
uncle
proposals
the
world
had
been
going
smoothly
for
him
in
other
ways
of
late
and
no
one
had
been
disagreeable
how
pleasant
to
keep
the
world
in
this
amiable
condition
and
how
dangerous
to
risk
displeasure
he
had
moreover
almost
not
quite
forgotten
that
his
rascal
of
a
nephew
was
living
in
the
same
house
as
miss
rand
and
even
if
he
did
remember
it
well
it
was
quite
another
part
of
the
house
and
in
all
probability
miss
rand
had
never
spoken
to
frank
breton
nor
so
much
as
said
good
day
to
him
finally
it
was
so
sumptuous
a
day
and
rachel
was
clothed
in
so
radiant
a
happiness
and
so
fluttering
and
billowing
and
chuckling
a
dress
of
white
and
blue
and
he
himself
was
looking
so
handsome
in
the
most
shining
of
the
broadest
of
black
bow
ties
the
most
elegant
of
trousers
and
the
whitest
of
white
spats
that
complaining
or
arguing
or
disputing
was
utterly
out
of
the
question
miss
rand
my
dear
what
the
address
right
you
are
so
off
they
went
she
arrived
to
find
miss
rand
a
round
chubby
lady
in
bright
pink
and
a
stranger
having
tea
together
the
chubby
lady
was
rand
and
the
stranger
was
francis
breton
she
had
not
expected
that
her
arrival
would
cause
such
a
disturbance
nor
that
she
herself
would
discover
the
right
and
easy
words
so
difficult
to
say
the
little
room
seemed
to
be
crowded
with
furniture
and
and
she
quite
deliberately
put
off
any
consideration
of
her
cousin
until
the
atmosphere
had
been
allowed
a
little
to
settle
around
them
miss
rand
looked
at
her
almost
sternly
and
was
plainly
at
a
loss
rand
was
excited
and
so
nervous
that
her
rattled
in
her
saucer
and
she
stayed
for
quite
a
long
time
with
her
finger
in
the
tea
under
the
delusion
that
she
was
using
a
teaspoon
rand
absence
of
mind
was
generally
due
to
the
fact
that
she
read
one
novel
a
day
all
the
year
round
and
that
her
thoughts
her
hopes
her
despairs
were
always
centred
in
the
book
of
the
day
although
when
came
she
could
not
tell
you
the
author
nor
the
title
nor
any
of
the
incidents
had
she
been
to
a
play
then
for
hours
following
it
was
the
drama
that
held
the
field
she
spent
her
life
in
an
amiable
desire
to
remember
for
the
sake
of
her
friends
the
plays
and
books
of
the
past
but
she
was
never
successful
as
she
said
the
attempt
to
keep
up
with
the
literature
and
drama
of
the
day
although
demands
all
one
time
and
energy
the
beaminster
family
alone
of
all
other
interests
in
the
wide
world
might
be
calculated
to
draw
her
out
of
the
realms
of
the
imagination
and
rachel
entrance
scattered
all
plots
to
the
four
winds
rachel
sat
down
and
for
a
little
while
rand
held
the
field
she
told
them
all
that
this
visit
of
miss
beaminster
was
the
most
wonderful
and
unexpected
thing
that
it
was
like
a
novel
and
that
she
would
never
forget
it
but
i
always
do
say
miss
beaminster
that
it
the
unexpected
that
happens
life
stranger
than
fiction
is
my
opinion
and
i
do
care
who
contradicts
me
i
shall
still
hold
it
at
length
rachel
had
leisure
to
consider
her
cousin
and
then
was
instantly
convinced
that
she
had
met
him
before
she
also
knew
that
she
could
not
have
met
him
before
in
the
strangest
way
he
was
connected
with
those
early
dream
years
which
now
she
struggled
so
sternly
to
forget
the
snow
the
bleak
sky
the
silence
the
some
strange
voice
speaking
high
in
air
as
though
from
a
distant
summit
and
all
this
coming
to
her
with
a
poignancy
that
even
now
brought
the
tears
to
her
heart
and
filled
it
to
overflowing
as
she
saw
his
thin
body
his
eyes
his
head
and
the
attitude
of
the
boy
in
all
his
movements
and
gestures
she
knew
that
for
her
he
belonged
to
that
earlier
world
she
knew
it
so
certainly
that
although
he
had
not
yet
spoken
she
could
be
sure
of
the
exact
quality
that
his
voice
would
have
and
confused
with
this
recognition
of
him
was
the
alarm
that
she
always
felt
when
her
early
life
returned
to
her
also
she
was
young
enough
to
be
pleased
at
the
agitation
into
which
her
coming
had
thrown
him
it
meant
plainly
so
much
to
him
although
he
was
silent
he
leant
forward
in
his
chair
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
waiting
for
his
opportunity
miss
rand
watching
him
saw
how
tremendously
this
meeting
with
one
of
the
family
excited
him
and
seeing
him
her
heart
filled
with
pity
he
so
young
it
is
hard
he
does
want
someone
to
look
after
him
rachel
happiness
had
now
returned
to
her
she
liked
them
all
so
much
it
was
all
so
cosy
it
was
so
good
of
them
to
wish
to
see
her
she
talked
with
rand
about
the
theatre
and
the
opera
we
going
to
the
opera
the
i
heard
it
in
munich
twice
but
never
with
van
rooy
who
singing
i
believe
that
an
experience
one
never
forgets
rand
did
not
really
care
about
opera
everything
in
opera
happened
so
slowly
except
in
and
even
that
was
better
simply
as
a
play
she
liked
musical
comedy
because
there
you
could
laugh
or
plays
like
for
instance
she
was
vague
as
to
the
and
she
had
never
heard
of
van
rooy
but
she
said
i
agree
with
you
miss
beaminster
there
nobody
like
him
at
that
breton
struck
in
with
something
about
music
that
he
had
heard
in
strange
places
abroad
and
then
rachel
looking
in
his
face
for
the
first
time
asked
him
about
his
travels
as
their
eyes
and
voices
met
she
was
again
overwhelmed
with
the
vivid
consciousness
of
their
earlier
meeting
she
thought
if
i
were
to
ask
him
whether
he
remembered
that
same
snow
and
silence
he
would
say
yes
i
know
he
would
say
yes
miss
rand
with
eyes
that
were
kind
but
very
very
sharp
watched
them
she
noticed
the
eagerness
of
breton
and
wished
that
he
did
not
seem
quite
so
anxious
to
please
but
that
because
he
young
she
thought
again
and
now
that
he
had
begun
the
words
poured
from
him
with
gesticulation
that
was
faintly
foreign
ever
so
little
dramatic
he
unpacked
his
adventures
he
spoke
as
though
this
were
beyond
all
time
moment
when
he
must
make
his
effect
he
did
it
well
a
born
teller
of
tales
and
yet
miss
rand
wished
that
he
had
not
had
to
do
it
at
all
that
there
had
been
more
reserve
less
drama
less
volubility
rand
an
older
desdemona
listened
spellbound
this
was
as
good
as
getting
a
circulating
library
without
paying
a
subscription
as
she
said
to
her
daughter
afterwards
he
really
was
as
good
as
those
novels
by
what
his
name
you
know
who
i
mean
those
delightful
stories
about
those
foreign
places
and
the
sea
he
spoke
of
the
first
time
that
he
had
actually
been
conscious
of
the
jungle
of
course
i
been
into
it
dozens
of
times
often
and
often
but
there
was
a
day
i
remember
as
though
it
were
yesterday
when
we
went
up
in
a
boat
some
river
or
another
that
river
was
the
most
secret
and
sleepy
green
and
the
place
all
closed
about
it
as
though
we
gone
into
a
box
and
they
closed
the
lid
nothing
but
the
green
river
and
all
the
forest
getting
closer
and
closer
and
darker
and
darker
all
blacker
than
you
can
imagine
and
worse
still
when
it
was
lighter
a
kind
of
twilight
and
you
could
see
enough
to
make
you
shiver
no
sound
but
the
animals
and
the
branches
and
the
great
plants
and
brilliant
flowers
all
creeping
and
crawling
suddenly
all
in
a
flash
i
wanted
a
and
a
public
house
a
wet
night
shining
on
streets
the
rattle
of
a
hansom
i
was
suddenly
ghastly
frightened
and
we
got
deeper
and
deeper
into
it
and
human
beings
further
and
further
behind
and
only
the
beastly
monkeys
and
the
alligators
and
the
hideous
flowers
i
can
feel
it
still
rachel
was
enthralled
he
called
up
on
every
side
about
her
that
stern
life
of
hers
he
knew
and
she
knew
they
alone
out
of
all
the
world
all
her
gaiety
her
happiness
her
interest
of
the
last
weeks
went
now
for
nothing
beside
this
experience
he
was
not
now
related
to
the
beaminsters
to
grandmother
to
aunt
adela
to
uncle
john
but
to
and
to
that
part
of
her
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
beaminsters
at
all
the
room
the
commonplace
furniture
the
pictures
of
lodore
falls
and
the
fighting
téméraire
the
little
glimpses
of
the
square
beyond
the
window
these
things
shared
in
the
mystery
miss
rand
had
seen
her
caught
and
held
very
young
too
she
said
to
herself
a
little
grimly
and
a
little
tenderly
also
all
too
sensational
to
be
true
she
thought
there
a
little
bit
of
unreality
in
him
all
the
way
through
rand
said
what
do
you
think
of
alligators
miss
beaminster
you
agree
with
me
that
they
must
be
most
unpleasant
to
meet
i
always
dislike
their
sluggish
ways
when
i
see
them
in
the
zoological
gardens
then
upon
them
all
broke
the
little
maid
with
a
husky
miss
carriage
please
mem
rachel
as
she
said
was
aware
of
him
again
as
her
scandalous
cousin
he
too
was
now
awkward
and
embarrassed
they
said
hurriedly
and
there
was
between
them
both
a
consciousness
that
no
word
of
the
family
or
their
relationship
had
been
mentioned
well
said
rand
when
the
door
was
closed
no
one
in
the
world
could
have
been
pleasanter
iii
they
did
not
arrive
at
the
opera
that
night
until
the
beginning
of
the
second
act
it
was
lady
carloes
box
and
she
and
uncle
john
and
roddy
seddon
were
rachel
companions
all
the
way
home
in
the
carriage
rachel
had
been
silent
and
lord
john
perceiving
uneasily
that
some
of
the
old
rachel
was
back
again
had
said
very
little
her
mind
was
confused
at
one
moment
she
felt
that
she
did
not
want
to
see
him
again
that
he
disturbed
her
peace
and
worried
her
with
memories
that
were
better
forgotten
at
another
moment
she
could
have
returned
then
and
there
to
ask
him
questions
to
know
whether
he
felt
this
or
that
had
he
ever
pictured
such
a
place
had
he
and
then
sharply
she
dismissed
such
thoughts
she
would
think
of
him
no
more
and
yet
he
did
not
look
a
villain
how
delightful
to
persuade
the
family
to
take
him
back
why
should
she
not
help
towards
a
reconciliation
she
was
herself
so
happy
now
that
she
could
not
bear
that
anyone
should
feel
outcast
or
lonely
they
were
all
very
hard
upon
him
it
was
not
until
she
heard
the
voices
of
the
apprentices
that
thought
of
her
cousin
left
her
as
she
groped
her
way
in
the
dark
box
and
heard
lady
carloes
stuffy
whisper
she
had
the
voice
of
a
cracknel
biscuit
you
sit
there
my
dear
lord
john
here
that
right
i
knew
you
be
late
because
she
was
gloriously
aware
that
quite
close
to
her
the
music
that
she
loved
best
in
all
the
world
was
transforming
existence
she
touched
roddy
hand
and
then
surrendered
herself
she
had
been
to
covent
garden
now
on
four
or
five
occasions
and
from
the
first
the
shabby
building
with
its
old
red
and
gold
its
air
of
belonging
to
any
period
earlier
than
the
one
it
was
just
then
amusing
its
attitude
above
all
of
indifference
to
its
aspect
all
this
had
attracted
her
and
won
her
affection
london
she
discovered
was
always
best
when
it
was
shabbiest
and
one
could
not
praise
it
more
highly
than
by
declaring
with
perfect
truth
that
it
was
the
shabbiest
city
in
the
world
now
feeling
instinctively
that
english
apprentices
she
had
had
already
some
taste
of
the
covent
garden
chorus
would
act
too
much
or
too
little
she
closed
her
eyes
now
as
the
music
reached
her
the
old
red
and
gold
seemed
a
cage
swinging
swinging
higher
and
ever
higher
with
old
lady
carloes
and
roddy
seddon
and
all
the
brilliant
people
in
the
stalls
and
all
the
enthusiastic
people
in
the
gallery
swinging
swinging
inside
it
she
could
feel
the
lift
of
it
the
rise
and
fall
and
almost
the
clearer
air
about
her
as
it
rose
into
the
stars
then
there
came
to
her
the
voice
for
which
she
had
surely
all
her
days
been
waiting
it
enwrapped
her
round
and
comforted
her
consoled
her
for
all
her
sorrows
reassured
her
for
all
her
fears
it
filled
the
cage
and
the
air
beyond
the
cage
it
was
of
earth
and
of
heaven
and
of
all
things
good
and
beautiful
in
this
world
and
the
next
for
the
second
time
her
early
years
came
back
to
her
the
voice
had
in
it
all
those
hours
when
someone
tenderness
had
made
life
worth
living
life
is
immortal
it
cried
and
i
am
immortal
for
i
am
love
and
charity
and
whatever
the
wise
ones
may
tell
you
i
can
not
die
she
felt
again
the
space
and
the
silence
and
the
snow
but
now
with
no
alarm
only
utter
reassurance
and
the
cage
swung
up
and
up
and
there
were
now
only
the
stars
and
the
wind
around
and
about
them
then
in
an
instant
of
time
the
cage
with
a
crash
was
upon
the
ground
across
her
world
had
cut
lady
carloes
voice
oh
yes
and
there
lord
crewner
no
not
in
that
row
the
one
behind
next
that
woman
with
the
silver
thing
in
her
hair
four
from
the
end
and
roddy
seddon
voice
yes
i
see
him
who
he
got
with
him
lady
carloes
again
i
ca
quite
see
miss
mendle
as
likely
as
not
you
know
old
aggie
mendle
daughter
rachel
felt
in
that
moment
that
murder
was
assuredly
no
crime
her
hands
shook
on
her
lap
and
one
of
those
passions
that
she
had
not
known
for
many
months
caught
her
so
that
she
could
have
torn
lardy
carloes
hair
from
her
head
had
the
chairs
been
happily
arranged
fortunately
the
interruption
had
been
accompanied
by
entrance
that
other
voice
was
for
the
moment
still
then
as
sachs
caught
up
beckmesser
serenade
there
came
again
well
of
course
if
you
ca
go
that
i
dare
say
she
give
you
another
only
i
know
she
settling
her
dates
now
yes
but
it
a
bore
havin
to
fix
up
such
a
long
way
ahead
and
you
do
know
what
old
stumers
you
may
be
boxed
up
with
oh
it
was
abominable
she
had
been
seeing
a
great
deal
of
roddy
during
these
last
weeks
and
ever
since
that
visit
to
uncle
richard
she
had
been
conscious
of
an
intimacy
that
she
had
certainly
not
resented
but
any
favour
that
he
may
have
had
with
her
was
certainly
now
forfeited
his
voice
was
again
superior
to
beckmesser
and
so
of
course
i
said
that
if
they
go
to
such
shockin
rot
i
was
goin
to
waste
my
evenin
she
pushed
her
chair
back
against
his
knees
beg
pardon
miss
beaminster
afraid
i
jolted
you
oh
keep
quiet
keep
quiet
her
whisper
was
so
urgent
so
packed
with
irritation
that
instantly
there
was
in
the
box
the
deepest
of
silences
she
sat
forward
again
anger
choking
her
she
could
not
recover
any
illusion
she
hated
him
him
the
crowd
came
on
with
a
whirl
then
there
was
that
last
moment
when
the
old
watchman
cries
to
the
genial
moon
and
the
silvered
roofs
then
the
curtain
fell
without
a
word
her
face
white
her
hands
still
trembling
she
rose
to
leave
the
box
she
passed
out
into
the
passage
and
found
that
roddy
was
by
her
side
i
say
miss
beaminster
i
am
most
awfully
sorry
most
awfully
i
any
idea
really
that
i
was
kickin
up
that
row
i
could
have
hit
myself
she
walked
down
the
passage
and
he
followed
her
she
was
superb
she
was
indeed
with
her
head
up
that
neck
those
hands
those
flashing
eyes
he
had
never
seen
anyone
so
fine
she
ought
always
to
be
enraged
that
instant
decided
him
she
was
the
woman
for
a
man
to
have
for
his
own
someone
who
could
look
like
someone
at
the
head
of
your
table
someone
with
the
right
blood
in
her
veins
someone
i
could
myself
he
said
again
how
dared
you
she
broke
out
at
last
they
were
by
good
luck
alone
in
the
passage
how
could
you
what
do
you
come
for
if
you
care
nothing
for
music
at
all
if
you
can
hear
a
voice
like
that
and
then
talk
about
your
own
silly
little
affairs
and
the
selfishness
of
it
of
course
you
think
of
nobody
but
yourself
upon
my
word
miss
beaminster
no
i
no
patience
with
you
go
to
your
musical
comedy
if
you
like
but
leave
music
like
this
for
people
who
can
appreciate
it
oh
she
was
superb
entirely
superb
she
ought
to
be
like
this
every
day
of
her
life
to
think
that
he
should
have
the
chance
of
winning
such
a
prize
nevertheless
she
would
not
speak
to
him
again
and
they
went
back
to
the
box
she
would
not
speak
to
lady
carloes
nor
to
her
uncle
then
as
the
loveliest
music
in
all
opera
flooded
the
building
her
anger
began
to
melt
he
had
looked
so
charmingly
repentant
and
after
all
the
was
long
for
anyone
who
did
not
really
care
for
music
and
then
they
all
did
talk
it
was
only
in
the
gallery
that
one
found
the
proper
reverence
her
anger
cooled
and
then
descended
upon
her
the
quintet
and
she
was
once
again
swept
in
her
cage
to
the
stars
now
she
and
all
live
things
seemed
to
be
opening
their
hearts
together
to
god
no
shame
now
to
speak
of
one
deepest
and
most
sacred
thoughts
no
fear
now
of
god
nor
the
archangels
nor
all
the
long
spaces
of
immortality
the
cage
had
ascended
to
the
highest
of
all
the
heavens
and
there
for
a
moment
one
might
stand
worshipping
with
bowed
head
the
quintet
ceased
and
rachel
felt
that
she
could
never
be
angry
with
anyone
again
she
wished
to
tell
him
so
at
last
the
revels
were
over
the
prieslied
had
won
its
praises
sachs
had
been
acclaimed
by
his
world
and
they
were
all
in
the
lobby
waiting
for
carriages
talking
laughing
hurrying
to
the
restaurants
her
face
was
lighted
now
with
happiness
she
touched
his
arm
i
did
mean
to
be
angry
like
that
it
was
silly
and
rude
of
me
forgive
me
please
he
turned
stuttering
forgive
you
he
took
her
hand
i
ought
to
have
been
shot
yes
i
never
forgive
myself
you
you
and
then
he
could
say
no
more
but
suddenly
raising
his
hat
bolted
away
as
the
door
swung
behind
him
lady
carloes
turned
a
perplexed
face
why
he
said
good
night
and
now
i
shall
never
find
but
lord
john
appeared
just
then
and
all
was
well
going
back
in
the
dark
brougham
rachel
put
her
head
on
her
shoulder
and
exhausted
with
excitement
and
happiness
and
something
more
than
either
of
them
cried
her
eyes
away

i
to
the
ordinary
observer
lizzie
rand
was
during
that
hot
july
as
she
had
ever
been
the
servants
in
portland
place
could
detect
no
change
but
then
they
did
not
search
for
one
having
long
regarded
miss
rand
as
a
piece
of
machinery
symbolized
by
that
broad
shining
belt
of
hers
happily
calculated
to
fit
precisely
the
duties
for
which
it
was
required
but
miss
rand
herself
knew
that
there
was
a
sharp
accurate
shrewd
piece
of
machinery
named
miss
rand
and
a
breathing
emotional
uncertain
human
being
called
lizzie
there
had
always
been
those
two
but
since
the
inadequacy
of
her
mother
and
sister
had
been
confronted
with
the
stern
necessity
of
making
two
ends
meet
miss
rand
had
been
in
constant
demand
and
lizzie
had
only
by
her
occasional
obtrusion
made
life
complicated
and
disturbing
miss
rand
had
told
herself
that
lizzie
was
now
almost
an
anachronism
that
the
emotions
in
life
that
aroused
her
were
bad
cheap
emotions
and
that
this
was
an
age
that
demanded
increasingly
of
women
a
hard
practical
efficiency
without
sentiments
or
enthusiasms
these
forcible
arguments
had
for
a
time
kept
lizzie
in
a
darkened
background
it
was
some
years
since
miss
rand
had
been
disturbed
but
now
in
the
warm
weather
of
lizzie
had
not
only
reappeared
but
had
leapt
an
insistent
shining
presence
into
urgent
life
miss
rand
faced
her
what
had
created
her
a
little
the
weather
the
beauty
of
those
brazen
days
a
little
rachel
coming
out
into
the
world
an
adventure
that
had
stirred
the
whole
house
into
a
new
and
sympathetic
excitement
a
little
these
things
but
chiefly
and
no
pretence
nor
shame
could
conceal
the
fact
did
this
new
lizzie
owe
her
creation
to
the
appearance
of
francis
breton
lizzie
rand
had
had
from
her
birth
a
romantic
heart
she
had
had
also
a
prosaic
practical
exterior
and
a
mind
as
hard
and
clear
if
necessary
as
her
own
most
lucent
typewriter
the
romantic
heart
had
throughout
these
years
been
there
and
now
this
romantic
scandalous
youthful
engaging
unfortunate
had
called
it
out
she
was
never
so
warmly
attracted
as
by
someone
lacking
most
obviously
in
those
qualities
with
which
she
herself
abounded
that
people
should
be
foolish
impetuous
careless
haphazard
commended
them
straight
to
her
keeping
poor
dears
had
their
instant
claim
upon
her
her
mother
and
sister
were
poor
dears
and
she
had
suffered
from
them
now
during
many
years
francis
breton
was
most
assuredly
a
poor
dear
here
the
duchess
a
little
flung
her
shadow
and
confused
the
mind
although
lizzie
had
never
seen
that
splendid
figure
she
was
nevertheless
acutely
conscious
of
her
she
was
conscious
of
her
through
her
own
imagination
through
her
mother
finally
through
lady
adela
her
imagination
painted
the
old
lady
the
room
the
furniture
fantastic
strangely
coloured
always
with
dramatic
effect
her
picture
was
never
precisely
defined
but
in
its
very
vagueness
lay
its
terrors
and
its
omens
miss
rand
the
most
practical
and
collected
of
young
women
could
never
pass
the
duchess
door
without
a
creep
through
her
mother
the
duchess
came
to
her
as
the
head
of
society
society
had
never
troubled
lizzie
visions
of
life
she
had
in
her
years
with
the
beaminsters
seen
it
pass
before
her
with
all
its
comedy
and
pathos
and
the
figures
that
had
been
concerned
in
that
procession
had
seemed
to
her
exactly
like
the
figures
in
any
other
procession
except
that
they
were
dressed
for
their
especial
subject
but
oddly
enough
when
through
her
own
observation
this
life
seen
accurately
at
first
hand
amounted
only
to
any
other
life
seen
through
the
eyes
of
her
mother
it
achieved
another
size
she
knew
that
her
mother
was
a
foolish
woman
that
her
mother
opinions
on
life
were
absurd
and
untrue
and
yet
that
dim
great
figure
that
the
duchess
assumed
in
her
mother
eyes
in
some
odd
way
impressed
her
lastly
and
most
strikingly
of
all
came
lady
adela
conception
to
her
lady
adela
was
in
terror
of
her
mother
everyone
knew
it
friends
relations
servants
lizzie
herself
saw
it
in
a
thousand
different
ways
saw
it
when
lady
adela
spoke
of
her
saw
it
in
the
way
that
lady
adela
addressed
dorchester
when
that
grim
woman
was
interviewed
by
her
saw
it
when
lady
adela
was
suddenly
summoned
to
that
room
upstairs
lizzie
during
the
hours
when
she
was
writing
from
lady
dictation
or
working
with
her
found
her
dry
stupid
sometimes
kind
never
emotional
it
was
to
her
therefore
the
most
convincing
proof
of
the
duchess
power
this
emotion
this
alarm
drawn
from
so
dry
a
heart
now
the
influence
that
the
duchess
had
upon
lizzie
was
always
a
confused
one
persuasion
from
this
source
followed
lines
of
reasoning
that
were
false
and
led
to
some
conclusions
that
were
muddled
and
untrue
through
such
minds
as
her
mother
and
lady
adela
no
clear
truth
could
come
and
yet
it
was
through
such
minds
as
these
that
the
influence
descended
upon
lizzie
it
descended
now
with
regard
to
francis
breton
it
told
lizzie
that
breton
had
been
proved
by
society
to
be
a
scoundrel
that
he
should
be
no
worthy
man
friend
that
he
belonged
to
that
world
the
world
of
shadows
and
past
misadventures
that
no
proper
soul
might
with
honesty
investigate
this
was
what
the
duchess
told
to
lizzie
and
perhaps
by
so
doing
increased
her
sympathy
with
the
sinner
ii
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
rand
had
not
at
first
been
unsettled
by
scruples
the
fact
that
breton
was
in
the
eyes
of
the
beaminster
family
a
who
had
brought
disgrace
upon
the
family
name
had
for
a
time
distressed
her
but
the
romantic
hope
of
being
herself
the
agent
of
his
restoration
to
his
grandmother
and
the
delightful
manners
of
the
scoundrel
when
he
appeared
killed
her
alarm
rand
mind
was
a
dark
misty
place
except
when
the
candles
of
romance
were
lit
when
flamed
blown
by
the
wind
though
they
might
be
there
was
around
the
candlesticks
at
any
rate
a
real
and
even
splendid
blaze
one
afternoon
towards
the
end
of
july
rand
meeting
breton
on
their
doorstep
was
moved
to
ask
him
whether
he
would
come
in
and
spend
the
evening
with
them
if
he
had
nothing
better
to
do
they
had
only
a
simple
little
meal
and
would
he
please
not
bother
to
dress
breton
said
that
he
would
be
delighted
rand
had
been
that
afternoon
to
a
romantic
comedy
in
which
ladies
and
gentlemen
with
french
accents
had
made
love
and
escaped
together
and
been
caught
together
and
been
married
together
rand
had
gone
quite
alone
into
the
pit
and
had
returned
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
affection
for
all
the
world
so
she
had
asked
breton
to
dinner
after
a
while
however
she
was
a
little
uncertain
daisy
was
away
in
the
country
with
friends
how
would
lizzie
then
like
this
unexpected
visitor
rand
was
quite
frankly
frightened
of
lizzie
and
complained
of
her
a
good
many
times
a
week
to
daisy
lizzie
was
for
ever
interfering
with
innocent
pleasures
lizzie
was
mean
and
unromantic
and
unimaginative
lizzie
was
thoroughly
tiresome
the
fact
that
lizzie
worked
incessantly
for
her
mother
and
her
sister
never
occurred
to
rand
at
all
lizzie
objected
to
all
innocent
amusement
and
she
would
in
all
likelihood
object
now
however
when
rand
with
a
fearful
mind
said
oh
lizzie
dear
had
such
a
delightful
afternoon
i
went
to
and
the
and
it
was
too
charming
you
ought
to
go
really
and
breton
coming
to
dinner
lizzie
only
smiled
a
little
and
asked
whether
there
was
food
enough
lizzie
was
strange
alone
in
her
bedroom
lizzie
wondered
at
her
excitement
she
looked
at
her
trim
neat
figure
in
the
glass
with
the
hair
so
gravely
brushed
with
her
collar
and
her
cuffs
with
her
compact
businesslike
air
what
had
she
to
do
with
excitement
because
a
young
man
was
coming
to
dinner
it
must
be
because
i
tired
this
heat
she
said
to
the
mirror
and
the
mirror
replied
you
know
that
you
are
glad
because
your
sister
daisy
is
away
and
to
that
she
had
no
answer
when
he
arrived
he
was
grave
and
seemed
sad
and
tired
she
thought
dinner
was
a
serious
affair
and
rand
who
disliked
people
when
they
refused
to
respond
to
her
moods
wished
at
first
that
she
had
not
asked
him
and
felt
sure
that
there
was
much
truth
in
what
people
said
about
his
wickedness
then
when
dinner
was
nearly
over
he
brightened
up
and
told
stories
and
was
entertaining
rand
noticed
that
he
drank
much
claret
but
this
was
after
all
a
compliment
to
her
housekeeping
by
the
end
of
dinner
rand
almost
loved
him
and
wished
that
daisy
had
been
here
to
entertain
him
of
course
it
must
be
dull
for
a
man
with
only
a
plain
girl
like
lizzie
for
company
lizzie
meanwhile
knew
that
he
was
waiting
for
an
opportunity
of
speech
she
had
read
an
appeal
in
his
eyes
when
he
had
first
entered
the
room
and
now
she
sat
there
curiously
ironically
amused
at
her
own
agitation
lizzie
rand
she
said
to
herself
you
only
after
all
the
kind
of
fool
that
you
despise
other
people
for
being
what
are
you
after
in
this
nevertheless
even
now
in
retrospect
how
arid
and
sterile
seemed
all
those
other
active
useful
days
one
moment
little
grain
of
sentiment
and
a
life
hard
work
goes
for
nothing
in
comparison
after
dinner
when
the
lamp
burnt
brightly
and
the
furniture
seemed
to
be
less
anxious
to
fill
every
possible
space
and
the
windows
were
opened
into
the
square
with
its
stars
and
grey
shadows
the
room
seemed
of
a
sudden
comfortable
and
rand
sitting
in
an
with
a
novel
on
her
lap
and
spectacles
on
her
nose
was
almost
cosy
she
had
left
before
going
to
her
matinee
a
at
one
of
its
most
thrilling
crises
and
lizzie
knew
that
the
talk
with
breton
depended
for
its
very
existence
on
the
relative
strength
of
the
play
and
the
novel
if
and
the
were
the
more
powerful
then
would
rand
make
a
discursive
third
but
no
for
a
moment
there
was
a
pause
then
indecisively
rand
took
up
her
book
for
a
while
she
talked
to
breton
over
its
pages
then
the
light
of
excitement
stole
into
her
eyes
her
soul
was
netted
by
the
snarer
breton
was
forgotten
as
though
he
had
never
been
their
chairs
were
by
the
open
window
and
a
very
little
breeze
came
and
played
around
them
in
the
square
there
was
that
sense
of
some
imminent
occurrence
a
breathless
suggestion
of
suspense
that
a
hot
evening
sometimes
carries
with
it
the
stars
blazed
in
a
purple
sky
and
a
moon
was
full
rounded
a
plate
of
gold
beneath
such
splendour
the
square
was
cool
and
dim
you
must
think
mother
rude
lizzie
said
with
a
little
smile
if
she
once
gets
deep
into
a
book
nothing
can
tear
her
from
it
he
said
something
but
she
could
see
that
he
was
not
thinking
of
rand
it
was
always
in
the
evening
she
thought
when
uncertain
colours
and
shadows
filled
the
air
that
he
looked
his
best
he
touched
now
as
he
had
touched
on
that
day
of
their
first
meeting
a
note
of
something
fine
and
strange
someone
very
young
and
perhaps
very
foolish
and
impetuous
but
someone
armoured
in
courage
and
set
apart
for
some
great
purpose
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
flinging
every
now
and
again
little
restless
glances
beyond
the
window
pulling
sometimes
at
his
beard
answering
her
then
suddenly
he
began
fiercely
looking
away
from
her
miss
rand
i
got
an
apology
to
make
to
you
his
voice
was
so
low
that
she
could
only
catch
the
words
by
leaning
forward
to
me
yes
i
been
wanting
to
speak
all
these
weeks
it
seemed
right
enough
before
but
since
i
known
you
i
felt
ashamed
of
it
as
though
done
something
wrong
what
is
it
mr
breton
her
clear
grave
eyes
encouraged
him
why
i
came
to
this
house
took
my
rooms
simply
because
i
knew
that
you
were
here
that
i
was
here
yes
i
was
looking
about
in
this
part
of
the
world
for
rooms
i
wanted
to
be
near
portland
place
you
know
i
came
here
and
old
tweed
talked
a
lot
and
then
after
a
time
i
said
something
about
my
grandmother
and
then
she
told
me
that
someone
who
lived
here
did
secretarial
work
for
my
aunt
he
stopped
abruptly
well
said
lizzie
laughing
all
this
is
not
very
terrible
then
you
see
i
determined
to
stay
i
was
full
of
absurd
ideas
just
at
the
time
thought
that
i
was
going
to
take
some
great
revenge
i
was
quite
melodramatic
and
so
i
thought
that
i
use
you
get
to
know
you
and
then
through
you
do
something
or
another
lizzie
eyed
him
with
merriment
upon
my
word
what
were
you
going
to
make
me
do
carry
bombs
into
your
aunt
bedroom
or
set
fire
to
the
portland
place
house
tell
me
i
should
like
to
know
ah
he
said
it
all
very
well
for
you
to
laugh
it
very
kind
of
you
to
take
it
that
way
but
lots
of
women
would
have
liked
it
they
have
thought
it
another
of
the
things
i
always
accused
of
doing
i
suppose
said
lizzie
gravely
it
was
all
perfectly
natural
i
understand
i
should
have
done
just
the
same
kind
of
thing
i
expect
if
i
been
in
your
place
the
fierceness
of
his
voice
showed
her
that
he
had
been
brooding
for
weeks
and
that
life
was
just
now
harder
than
he
could
endure
you
can
trust
me
a
great
deal
farther
than
that
breton
she
said
the
other
night
he
began
you
said
that
i
might
talk
to
you
been
pretty
lonely
lately
and
it
would
help
me
if
anything
you
like
she
assured
him
besides
there
more
than
that
he
went
on
you
heard
of
course
you
must
have
heard
all
kinds
of
things
against
me
you
in
the
enemy
camp
and
i
do
suppose
they
measure
their
words
i
do
know
why
you
been
so
decent
to
me
as
you
have
after
what
you
must
have
heard
do
worry
your
head
about
that
she
said
we
all
have
our
enemies
no
but
now
that
we
friends
i
like
you
to
know
my
side
of
it
all
i
do
want
to
make
myself
out
a
hero
or
blacken
all
the
other
people
but
there
something
to
be
said
for
me
there
there
he
muttered
these
last
words
with
the
deepest
intensity
he
seemed
to
fling
them
through
the
window
into
the
square
as
though
he
were
standing
out
there
on
his
defence
before
all
those
listening
lighted
windows
i
been
a
fool
a
thousand
times
i
done
silly
things
often
and
once
or
twice
bad
rotten
things
but
all
these
others
these
virtuous
people
who
are
so
ready
to
judge
me
have
they
been
any
better
my
father
was
a
scoundrel
although
i
loved
him
and
would
love
him
now
if
he
came
back
but
he
was
just
as
bad
as
they
make
and
there
no
use
in
denying
it
he
tell
you
so
himself
if
he
were
here
he
broke
my
poor
mother
heart
and
killed
her
i
do
remember
her
i
was
no
age
at
all
when
she
died
but
i
got
an
old
picture
of
her
kept
it
always
with
me
she
must
have
been
rather
like
my
cousin
rachel
who
was
here
the
other
day
watched
his
face
there
had
left
him
now
all
that
hint
of
insincerity
of
exaggeration
that
she
had
noticed
when
he
had
talked
before
she
knew
that
he
was
telling
her
now
absolutely
the
truth
as
he
saw
it
she
died
and
after
that
i
was
taken
about
europe
with
my
father
we
lived
in
almost
every
capital
in
europe
berlin
paris
rome
vienna
everywhere
sometimes
we
were
rich
sometimes
poor
sometimes
we
knew
the
very
best
people
sometimes
the
very
worst
sometimes
i
go
to
school
for
a
little
then
i
suddenly
be
taken
away
my
father
was
splendid
to
me
then
the
man
you
ever
saw
tall
broad
carried
himself
magnificently
the
finest
man
in
europe
i
only
knew
bit
by
bit
the
things
that
he
used
to
do
it
was
cards
most
of
the
time
and
he
taught
me
to
play
of
course
as
he
taught
me
to
do
everything
else
when
i
was
eighteen
my
eyes
were
opened
i
tried
to
leave
him
but
i
loved
him
and
i
verily
believe
that
i
was
the
only
human
being
in
the
world
that
he
cared
for
anyway
he
died
of
fever
and
general
dissipation
when
i
had
just
come
of
age
and
i
came
home
to
england
with
a
little
money
and
great
hopes
of
putting
myself
right
with
the
world
as
he
had
talked
to
her
he
had
gathered
confidence
her
silence
was
in
some
way
to
him
reassuring
and
comforting
some
people
have
the
gift
of
listening
without
words
so
warmly
with
such
eloquence
that
they
reassure
and
console
as
no
speech
could
ever
do
this
was
lizzie
gift
and
breton
depending
more
than
most
human
beings
upon
the
protection
of
his
fellows
gathered
courage
my
father
had
always
taught
me
to
hate
my
grandmother
he
painted
her
to
me
as
i
have
since
found
her
remorseless
eaten
up
with
pride
cruel
i
came
home
to
england
meaning
to
lead
a
new
life
to
be
decent
as
i
always
wanted
to
be
well
they
would
have
me
not
one
of
them
they
pretended
to
at
first
and
my
uncle
john
at
least
was
sincere
i
think
and
was
kind
for
a
time
but
was
afraid
of
my
grandmother
as
they
all
were
christopher
you
know
him
of
course
was
a
real
friend
to
me
he
stood
up
for
my
father
before
and
he
stood
up
for
me
now
but
what
was
the
use
i
was
wild
when
i
saw
that
my
grandmother
was
against
me
and
was
going
to
do
her
best
to
ruin
me
i
just
did
care
then
what
was
the
good
of
it
all
other
people
encouraged
me
the
set
in
london
that
hated
my
people
would
have
done
something
with
me
but
i
would
be
held
by
anyone
i
not
excusing
myself
he
said
quietly
looking
away
from
the
window
and
suddenly
taking
his
judgment
from
her
eyes
i
know
you
not
she
said
smiling
back
to
him
cards
finished
me
i
always
loved
gambling
i
love
it
still
my
father
had
given
me
a
good
education
in
it
there
were
plenty
of
fellows
in
town
to
take
one
on
and
oh
it
all
such
an
old
story
now
not
worth
digging
up
but
there
was
a
house
and
a
table
and
a
young
fool
who
lost
all
he
possessed
and
well
did
for
himself
it
had
all
been
square
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
but
somebody
had
to
be
a
scapegoat
and
two
or
three
of
us
were
named
it
was
hushed
up
for
the
sake
of
the
young
fellow
people
but
everyone
knew
of
course
they
all
said
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
father
like
son
and
i
think
i
minded
that
more
than
anything
oh
i
sorry
i
sorry
lizzie
said
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
that
it
had
all
been
straight
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
gambling
just
as
anyone
might
that
what
made
me
so
mad
to
think
of
the
rest
of
them
all
so
virtuous
and
good
and
then
going
off
to
monte
carlo
and
losing
or
winning
their
little
bit
just
as
i
done
i
tried
to
brazen
it
out
for
a
bit
but
it
was
no
good
christopher
still
stuck
by
me
otherwise
it
was
well
the
under
ten
you
know
the
under
ten
yes
all
the
men
and
women
who
done
something
once
done
one
of
the
things
that
you
must
do
it
may
have
been
very
bad
not
half
so
bad
as
the
things
the
cruel
mean
things
that
most
people
do
every
day
of
their
lives
but
once
it
there
you
down
you
under
a
regular
colony
of
them
here
in
london
their
life
amusing
there
they
are
hanging
on
here
keeping
up
some
pretence
of
gaiety
some
kind
of
decency
waiting
hoping
that
the
day
will
come
when
they
be
taken
back
again
when
everything
will
be
forgotten
they
pretend
bravely
enough
not
to
mind
their
snubs
not
to
notice
the
kind
people
once
their
friends
who
cut
them
now
every
now
and
again
they
make
a
spring
like
fish
to
the
top
of
the
water
see
the
sun
hope
that
the
light
and
air
are
to
be
theirs
again
after
all
and
then
back
they
are
pushed
down
into
the
dark
their
element
now
they
are
told
oh
there
comedy
there
miss
rand
if
you
care
to
look
for
it
she
said
nothing
the
fierce
bitterness
in
his
voice
had
made
him
seem
older
suddenly
as
though
in
this
portion
of
his
journey
be
had
spent
many
many
years
i
must
cut
it
short
you
have
had
enough
of
this
i
could
stand
it
i
left
london
and
went
abroad
after
that
what
did
i
do
i
was
everywhere
i
did
everything
sometimes
i
was
straight
sometimes
i
was
i
was
always
bitter
wild
with
fury
when
i
thought
of
that
old
woman
of
her
complacency
sitting
there
and
striking
down
all
the
poor
devils
that
had
been
less
fortunate
than
she
all
those
years
abroad
i
nourished
that
anger
and
at
last
when
i
thought
that
i
been
abroad
long
enough
that
people
would
have
forgotten
perhaps
and
forgiven
i
came
back
i
came
back
to
be
revenged
on
my
grandmother
and
to
myself
i
got
some
money
enough
for
a
little
annuity
and
i
was
careful
now
i
was
going
to
make
any
mistakes
this
time
he
laughed
bitterly
one
does
learn
much
with
age
what
a
fool
i
was
i
got
the
reputation
i
had
before
whether
i
good
or
bad
it
would
all
be
hopeless
utterly
hopeless
if
it
were
for
one
thing
she
looked
up
and
as
she
glanced
at
him
could
feel
the
furious
beating
of
her
heart
i
go
back
at
once
i
almost
gone
back
already
not
abroad
that
never
again
for
long
but
back
to
my
friends
the
unfortunates
he
laughed
they
anxious
to
have
me
they
welcome
me
i
can
have
my
cards
and
the
rest
then
with
no
one
to
object
or
to
lecture
and
be
done
for
quite
nicely
completely
done
for
then
he
pulled
himself
together
squared
his
shoulders
but
one
thing
keeps
me
he
said
something
happened
in
the
last
few
weeks
met
somebody
yes
she
said
almost
in
a
whisper
somebody
who
made
it
worth
while
for
me
to
fight
on
a
bit
she
could
feel
his
agitation
his
voice
although
he
tried
very
hard
to
control
it
was
shaking
then
he
laughed
raised
his
voice
and
caught
and
held
her
eyes
with
his
but
there
miss
rand
i
talked
a
fearful
lot
only
i
wanted
to
tell
you
i
had
to
tell
you
and
now
if
you
feel
that
you
rather
not
know
me
you
only
got
to
say
so
she
laughed
a
little
unsteadily
thank
you
for
taking
me
into
your
confidence
you
shall
never
regret
it
i
glad
you
going
to
hold
on
and
after
all
we
all
doing
that
more
or
less
it
done
me
a
world
of
good
talking
like
this
it
what
i
been
wanting
for
months
she
quieted
her
emotion
looking
out
into
the
stars
she
knew
that
she
believed
every
word
that
he
had
said
she
thought
that
she
valued
truth
above
every
other
quality
the
directness
that
there
was
in
truth
its
honesty
and
clarity
he
might
not
always
be
honest
with
her
but
she
would
never
forget
that
he
had
on
this
night
at
least
spoken
no
falsehood
life
her
work
her
surroundings
portland
place
her
home
this
was
full
of
falsehood
and
deceit
and
muddle
here
this
evening
at
last
was
honesty
they
said
no
more
but
sat
there
silently
and
listened
to
the
echo
of
dance
music
from
some
house
rand
whom
their
conversation
had
lured
into
oblivion
of
them
was
roused
now
by
their
silence
she
looked
up
it
quite
splendid
she
said
you
must
read
it
lizzie
the
part
about
the
riviera
is
lovely
then
slowly
remembering
really
breton
i
afraid
you
must
consider
me
very
rude
he
came
towards
her
assuring
her
that
his
evening
had
been
delightful
lizzie
was
happy
happier
than
she
could
ever
remember
to
have
been
before
she
felt
her
cheeks
burn
she
leant
out
of
the
window
to
cool
them
she
flung
back
over
her
shoulder
by
the
way
breton
a
piece
of
gossip
your
cousin
is
to
marry
sir
roderick
seddon
she
could
not
see
him
he
said
nothing
rand
said
really
lizzie
how
interesting
how
long
that
been
announced
oh
it
is
announced
i
do
believe
that
he
even
asked
her
but
all
the
house
knows
it
it
settled
i
believe
she
likes
him
immensely
and
of
course
the
duchess
is
devoted
to
him
anything
would
do
to
talk
about
what
did
it
matter
only
that
she
should
keep
on
talking
so
that
they
should
not
see
how
happy
she
was
how
happy
he
said
good
night
rather
sharply
his
voice
was
constrained
as
though
he
too
were
keeping
in
his
emotion
after
he
had
gone
rand
said
i
do
like
him
my
dear
i
help
it
you
may
laugh
at
me
but
my
impressions
are
always
right
he
hardly
spoke
to
me
all
the
evening
why
mother
you
were
reading
how
could
he
that
all
very
well
but
i
do
like
him
and
i
believe
he
in
love
with
his
cousin
he
went
quite
white
when
you
spoke
about
the
engagement
mother
how
absurd
you
are
he
only
seen
her
once
well
my
dear
that
a
book
you
ought
to
read
really
i
enjoyed
anything
so
much
for
weeks
i
simply
up
in
her
bedroom
lizzie
flung
wide
her
window
and
laughed
at
the
golden
moon
then
she
lay
for
hours
staring
at
the
pale
light
that
it
flung
upon
her
ceiling
oh
what
a
fool
she
was
but
she
was
happy
happy
happy
and
he
needed
someone
to
look
after
him
he
did
indeed
chapter
xi
her
grace
day
i
the
duchess
had
suffered
during
the
last
five
or
six
years
from
sleeplessness
and
throughout
these
hot
days
and
nights
of
june
and
july
sleep
almost
deserted
her
grimly
she
gave
it
no
quarter
allowing
to
no
one
that
she
was
sleeping
badly
pretending
even
to
christopher
that
all
was
well
nevertheless
those
long
dark
hours
began
to
tell
upon
her
she
had
known
many
nights
sleepless
through
pain
certain
nights
sleepless
through
anxiety
but
they
terrible
though
they
had
been
had
not
worn
so
stern
a
look
as
these
long
black
spaces
of
time
when
all
rest
and
comfort
seemed
to
be
drawn
from
her
by
some
mysterious
hand
to
herself
now
she
admitted
that
she
dreaded
that
moment
when
dorchester
left
her
she
began
to
do
what
she
had
never
in
her
life
done
before
to
fall
asleep
during
the
daytime
small
mercy
to
anyone
who
might
attract
any
attention
to
those
little
naps
she
fell
asleep
often
towards
six
or
seven
and
therefore
without
any
comment
dorchester
seeing
her
fatigue
left
her
to
sleep
until
late
in
the
morning
she
had
not
for
many
years
left
her
room
before
midday
but
she
had
been
awake
with
her
correspondence
and
the
papers
by
seven
at
the
latest
now
it
was
often
eleven
before
she
awoke
she
found
that
she
did
not
awake
with
the
energy
and
freshness
that
she
had
always
known
before
about
her
there
always
hovered
a
great
cloud
of
fatigue
something
not
quite
present
but
threatening
at
any
moment
to
descend
on
a
certain
morning
late
in
july
she
awoke
after
two
or
three
restless
sleep
as
she
woke
she
was
conscious
that
those
hours
had
not
removed
from
her
that
threatening
cloud
she
heard
a
clock
strike
eleven
dorchester
was
drawing
back
the
curtains
and
from
behind
the
blinds
there
leapt
upon
her
a
blazing
torrid
day
her
bedroom
carried
on
the
touch
of
fantasy
that
her
other
room
had
shown
she
was
lying
in
a
red
lacquer
japanese
bed
that
mounted
up
behind
her
like
a
throne
her
was
an
embossed
dull
gold
and
the
chairs
were
carved
indian
of
black
ebony
lying
in
bed
she
appeared
very
old
and
ugly
the
sharp
nose
was
exceedingly
prominent
and
her
white
hair
scattered
about
the
pillow
gave
her
face
the
colour
of
dried
parchment
dorchester
brought
her
her
chocolate
and
her
letters
and
and
the
another
terribly
hot
day
your
grace
yes
i
suppose
so
as
she
took
her
letters
she
felt
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
it
would
perhaps
be
better
to
lie
in
bed
for
the
rest
of
her
life
and
conduct
the
world
from
there
she
put
the
letters
down
and
stared
at
the
day
draw
the
curtains
again
dorchester
and
kindly
ask
lady
adela
if
she
will
be
so
good
as
to
come
and
see
me
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
time
when
dorchester
had
gone
she
lay
back
and
closed
her
eyes
and
dozed
again
whilst
the
chocolate
grew
cold
and
the
births
and
deaths
and
marriages
grew
aged
and
stale
she
did
not
care
she
did
not
want
to
see
her
daughter
she
did
not
want
to
see
anyone
nor
was
there
anything
now
in
the
world
worth
her
energy
or
trouble
her
body
being
now
at
ease
was
called
back
to
days
brighter
days
days
filled
with
thrilling
events
and
thrilling
people
days
when
the
world
was
a
world
and
not
a
cinder
those
were
men
those
were
women
and
then
suddenly
she
was
conscious
first
that
her
daughter
was
speaking
and
then
that
her
daughter
was
a
tiresome
fool
she
sat
up
a
little
and
her
nightdress
fell
back
showing
a
neck
bony
crinkled
and
yellow
i
said
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
snapped
it
is
a
quarter
of
an
hour
mother
said
lady
adela
lady
adela
hated
and
dreaded
these
morning
interviews
in
the
first
place
she
disliked
the
decorations
of
her
mother
bedroom
thought
them
almost
indecent
and
could
never
be
comfortable
in
such
surroundings
she
was
also
aware
by
long
experience
that
her
mother
was
always
at
her
worst
at
this
hour
in
the
morning
and
many
were
the
storms
of
temper
that
that
absurd
bed
and
those
unpleasant
black
chairs
had
witnessed
thirdly
she
knew
that
she
herself
looked
her
worst
and
was
her
weakest
amongst
these
eccentricities
and
shadowed
by
this
dim
light
she
waited
now
whilst
her
mother
fumbled
her
letters
there
your
chocolate
mother
she
said
at
last
it
be
cold
the
duchess
was
looking
at
her
letters
but
was
absorbing
only
a
little
of
their
contents
she
was
summoning
all
her
will
to
her
aid
she
wanted
to
order
the
blind
to
be
pulled
down
to
command
her
daughter
to
avoid
her
presence
for
at
least
a
week
to
scatter
her
correspondence
to
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
and
to
see
none
of
it
again
at
the
same
time
she
was
driving
into
her
brain
the
fact
that
before
adela
of
all
people
in
the
world
she
must
be
alert
and
wise
and
wonderful
adela
the
ugliest
and
most
foolish
of
living
women
must
see
no
weakness
shall
i
read
your
letters
to
you
mother
she
did
not
answer
slowly
steadily
at
last
her
will
was
flooding
her
brain
she
could
feel
the
warmth
and
the
colour
and
the
strength
of
it
pervading
again
her
body
the
day
did
not
now
appear
of
so
appalling
a
heat
and
the
weight
of
the
things
to
be
done
was
less
heavy
upon
her
lady
adela
meanwhile
watching
her
mother
was
struck
once
again
by
that
chill
dismay
that
had
alarmed
her
first
on
that
may
evening
after
the
visit
to
the
picture
gallery
in
that
her
mother
did
seem
very
very
old
and
very
very
feeble
lady
adela
had
a
dreadful
temptation
to
say
in
a
brusque
sharp
voice
what
do
you
let
your
chocolate
get
cold
like
that
for
why
do
you
get
someone
to
read
your
letters
sensibly
to
you
instead
of
groping
through
them
like
that
and
at
the
mere
horror
of
such
a
thought
a
shudder
shook
her
and
her
heart
began
wildly
to
beat
let
once
such
words
as
those
cross
her
lips
and
an
edifice
a
wonderful
towering
temple
raised
by
submissions
and
subduals
and
would
tumble
to
the
ground
for
some
moments
the
struggle
in
lady
adela
breast
was
sharp
then
by
a
tense
dominion
of
her
will
she
produced
once
again
for
herself
the
ceremonial
the
terror
the
agitated
humble
submission
julia
massiter
the
duchess
said
has
asked
rachel
for
the
last
in
july
she
go
of
course
yes
said
lady
adela
roddy
seddon
is
going
yes
roddy
is
going
to
marry
rachel
he
coming
to
see
me
this
afternoon
lady
adela
was
silent
a
very
suitable
business
i
intended
it
for
a
long
time
then
after
a
pause
you
may
tell
dorchester
i
will
dress
now
lady
adela
conscious
as
she
left
the
room
of
the
relief
of
her
dismissal
joyfully
yielded
that
relief
as
witness
the
terror
was
still
there
and
she
was
glad
ii
very
different
however
at
three
in
the
afternoon
now
she
sat
in
her
high
black
chair
waiting
for
roddy
seddon
very
difficult
now
to
imagine
that
early
discourage
of
the
morning
magnificent
now
with
her
black
dress
and
flashing
eyes
and
white
hair
waiting
for
roddy
seddon
this
that
she
had
long
planned
was
at
length
to
come
to
pass
roddy
seddon
was
to
be
united
to
the
beaminster
family
never
again
to
be
separated
from
it
of
rachel
she
thought
not
at
all
she
had
never
liked
rachel
indeed
it
was
a
more
positive
feeling
than
that
alone
of
all
the
family
was
rachel
still
in
rebellion
even
the
duke
although
he
was
so
often
abroad
or
in
the
country
he
hated
london
was
submissive
enough
when
he
was
with
them
but
rachel
the
old
woman
knew
that
she
had
not
touched
frightened
yes
the
girl
hated
that
evening
and
would
give
a
great
deal
to
avoid
it
but
the
terror
that
she
showed
did
not
bring
her
any
closer
to
her
grandmother
power
she
stood
outside
and
away
the
duchess
had
attempted
to
influence
the
girl
brain
to
catch
some
trait
some
preference
some
dislike
that
she
could
hold
and
use
still
rachel
soul
was
beyond
her
grasp
beyond
even
her
guessing
at
but
she
knew
roddy
seddon
she
knew
roddy
seddon
as
no
one
knew
him
and
roddy
seddon
knew
her
even
when
he
was
a
boy
he
had
known
her
as
no
one
else
knew
her
he
had
seen
through
all
her
embroideries
and
disguises
had
known
where
she
was
theatrical
and
why
she
was
so
had
discovered
her
plots
and
prides
her
defeats
and
victories
and
together
they
two
pagan
to
the
very
bone
of
them
had
laughed
at
a
credulous
superstitious
world
the
london
that
knew
roddy
seddon
thought
him
a
country
bumpkin
with
dissipated
tastes
and
an
amiable
heart
but
she
knew
him
better
than
that
he
was
not
clever
no
he
was
amazingly
innocent
of
books
he
had
no
intellectual
attainments
whatever
yet
had
he
received
any
kind
of
education
she
knew
that
he
might
have
had
one
of
the
finest
brains
in
the
country
he
had
preferred
dogs
and
horses
and
the
simple
enjoyments
of
his
sensations
bowing
to
the
outward
rules
and
laws
of
the
modern
world
he
was
less
modern
than
anyone
she
had
ever
known
pagan
root
and
branch
pagan
in
his
simplicities
in
his
complexities
in
his
moralities
and
immoralities
in
his
kindnesses
and
cruelties
pagan
when
they
were
together
it
was
astonishing
the
number
of
trappings
that
they
were
able
to
discard
they
were
pagan
together
but
rachel
rachel
well
rachel
did
not
matter
it
would
be
a
rather
good
sight
to
see
rachel
suffer
to
watch
her
proud
spirit
up
against
something
that
she
could
not
understand
and
meanwhile
the
beaminster
family
was
strengthened
by
a
great
addition
and
the
campaign
against
this
new
generation
that
refused
to
be
led
that
wished
to
lead
that
thought
itself
so
very
very
brilliant
should
go
victoriously
forward
sir
roderick
seddon
your
grace
as
she
looked
at
the
healthy
and
roddy
sitting
opposite
to
her
for
an
instant
some
sharp
warning
some
foreordained
consciousness
of
trouble
to
come
bade
her
pause
she
knew
that
a
word
from
her
now
would
be
enough
to
prevent
the
match
he
would
not
prosecute
it
were
she
against
it
after
all
ought
roddy
to
marry
anybody
could
a
girl
as
ignorant
of
the
world
as
rachel
put
up
any
fight
against
roddy
simple
complexities
what
after
all
did
roddy
think
of
the
girl
did
he
imagine
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
did
he
know
her
understand
her
then
looking
at
him
the
affection
that
she
had
for
him
the
only
affection
that
she
had
for
anyone
in
the
world
swept
over
her
this
marriage
would
bind
him
to
her
would
give
her
another
ally
before
the
world
yes
it
should
go
on
she
smiled
at
him
well
roddy
have
you
no
news
for
me
now
he
had
been
silent
gazing
before
him
his
brows
puckered
now
he
smiled

then

i
she
paused
and
watched
his
anxiety
between
both
of
them
there
hung
now
the
recollection
of
so
many
things
conversations
and
deeds
and
thoughts
known
to
both
of
them
so
many
many
things

paused
and
then
in
a
voice
that
had
in
spite
of
her
real
emotion
you
have
my
consent
you
got
blessing
he
rose
and

clumsily
towards
her
you

but
i
dam
grateful
rippin
of

for
a
second

and
in
this
hot
weather
too
you
ask
her
at
julia
massiter
next
week

so
i
say

then
he
sat
down
again
the
room
was
relieved
of
an
immense
burden
once
more
they
were
at
ease
together
the
other
night
he
said
bending
forward
and
chuckling
ever
so
little
iii
lady
carloes
agnes
lady
farnet
and
old
brunning
were
coming
to
play
bridge
with
her
the
ceremonial
was
ever
the
same
they
arrived
at
nine
and
at
eleven
supper
for
four
was
served
in
the
duchess
little
green
room
behind
her
bedroom
a
little
room
like
a
box
with
a
green
a
and
silver
candlesticks
they
played
sometimes
until
three
or
four
in
the
morning
the
duchess
played
an
exceedingly
good
game
and
brunning
a
bony
little
woman
like
a
plucked
chicken
was
the
best
bridge
player
in
london
the
other
two
were
moderate
but
made
mistakes
which
allowed
the
duchess
the
free
use
of
her
most
caustic
wit
and
satire
lord
john
came
just
before
dinner
as
he
always
did
for
a
few
minutes
every
evening
he
stood
there
fat
and
smiling
and
amiable
and
as
always
a
little
nervous
well
john
she
liked
john
the
best
of
her
children
although
he
was
of
course
the
most
fearful
fool
but
she
liked
his
big
broad
face
and
he
was
always
clean
and
healthy
moreover
she
could
use
him
more
easily
than
any
of
them
bridge
mother
is
it
yes
not
so
hot
this
evening
just
give
me
that
book
turn
the
lamp
up
a
little
no
not
that
one
the
de
goncourt
book
yes
thank
you
anything
i
can
get
for
you
mother
anyone
i
can
send
to
you
he
was
thinking
as
he
smiled
down
at
her
she
old
old
and
tired
this
hot
weather
she
looked
up
at
him
before
she
settled
herself
roddy
seddon
came
this
afternoon
yes
i
know
suddenly
his
heart
began
to
beat
he
had
known
during
all
these
last
weeks
of
what
the
common
talk
had
been
he
knew
too
what
his
conscience
had
told
him
and
he
knew
too
how
perpetually
he
had
silenced
that
same
conscience
he
asked
me
whether
he
had
my
permission
to
propose
to
rachel
yes
of
course
i
gave
it
him
i
thought
it
most
suitable
in
every
way
now
was
lord
john
moment
he
knew
even
as
it
descended
upon
him
what
was
the
right
to
do
he
must
protest
roddy
seddon
was
not
the
right
man
to
marry
rachel
rachel
who
was
to
him
more
than
anyone
in
the
world
he
must
protest
and
then
with
that
impulse
went
the
old
warning
that
because
his
mother
seemed
to
him
older
and
feebler
than
he
had
ever
known
her
therefore
if
he
spoke
now
it
would
involve
far
more
than
the
immediate
dispute
there
was
a
sudden
impulse
in
him
to
risk
discomfort
to
risk
a
scene
to
break
perhaps
in
the
new
assertion
of
his
authority
all
the
old
domination
to
smash
a
tradition
to
pieces
he
glanced
at
his
mother
she
met
his
eyes
he
knew
that
she
was
daring
him
to
speak
after
all
would
be
a
better
time
she
was
tired
now
he
would
speak
then
his
eyes
fell
and
after
a
pause
and
a
word
about
some
indifferent
matter
he
said
good
night
and
went
iv
once
in
some
early
hour
of
the
morning
when
the
candles
were
burning
low
the
thought
of
rachel
came
to
her
even
as
she
noticed
that
her
hand
shone
magnificently
with
hearts
she
was
conscious
that
the
girl
stood
opposite
to
her
there
against
the
green
wall
straight
and
fierce
all
black
and
white
looking
at
her
christopher
john
for
a
second
her
brain
was
clouded
might
she
not
have
attempted
some
relationship
with
the
girl
given
her
some
counsel
and
a
little
kindness
she
must
have
been
lonely
there
in
that
great
house
without
a
friend
she
was
going
now
into
a
very
perilous
business
she
pushed
the
weakness
from
her
her
eyes
were
again
upon
the
cards
hearts
she
said
the
odd
trick
this
game
and
it
was
her
rubber
the
dying
flame
rose
in
the
silver
sconces
and
the
four
old
heads
bobbed
wildly
fantastically
upon
the
wall

rachel
sat
in
the
train
with
aunt
adela
and
uncle
john
they
were
on
their
way
to
trunton
perth
lord
massiter
country
house
it
was
a
july
day
softened
with
cool
airs
and
watered
colours
trees
and
fields
were
mingled
with
sky
and
cloud
through
the
counties
there
was
the
echo
of
running
streams
only
against
an
earth
fading
into
sky
and
a
sky
bending
and
embracing
earth
sharp
with
hard
edges
the
walls
and
towers
that
man
had
piled
together
showed
their
outlines
cut
as
with
a
sword
over
all
the
country
in
the
pale
blue
of
the
afternoon
sky
a
great
moon
was
burning
and
the
corn
ran
in
fine
abundance
to
the
summit
of
the
hills
rachel
as
the
train
plunged
with
her
into
the
heart
of
sussex
was
gazing
happily
through
the
window
dreaming
almost
dozing
feeling
in
every
part
of
her
a
warm
and
grateful
content
opposite
to
her
aunt
adela
gaunt
and
with
the
expression
that
she
always
wore
in
trains
as
of
one
whose
person
and
property
were
in
danger
at
any
instant
of
total
destruction
read
a
life
of
a
recently
deceased
general
whose
widow
she
knew
uncle
john
with
three
illustrated
papers
was
interested
in
photographs
of
people
with
one
leg
in
the
air
and
their
mouths
wide
open
every
now
and
again
he
would
say
to
nobody
in
particular
there
old
reggie
cutler
with
that
foreign
woman
know
or
fancy
shorty
monmouth
being
at
cowes
after
all
this
year
you
know
we
heard
rachel
had
been
having
a
wonderful
time
that
was
the
great
fact
that
ran
up
and
down
through
her
dozing
thoughts
yes
a
wonderful
time
it
was
surely
now
a
century
ago
that
strange
period
when
she
had
dreaded
so
terribly
her
plunge
that
day
after
her
visit
to
the
bond
street
gallery
when
it
had
all
seemed
simply
more
than
she
could
possibly
encounter
those
talks
with
may
eversley
who
by
the
way
had
just
announced
herself
as
engaged
to
a
baronet
when
the
world
had
frowned
down
from
a
vast
incredible
height
upon
a
miserably
terrified
midget
why
the
absurdity
of
it
it
had
all
been
as
easy
simply
as
easy
as
though
she
had
been
plunged
in
the
very
heart
of
it
all
her
life
followed
there
swiftly
upon
that
the
knowledge
that
roddy
seddon
was
to
be
for
this
same
at
lady
massiter
rachel
did
not
pretend
that
ever
since
that
night
at
the
opera
she
had
not
known
of
his
attentions
to
her
impossible
to
avoid
them
had
she
wished
impossible
to
pretend
ignorance
of
the
meaning
that
his
inarticulate
sentences
had
of
late
conveyed
impossible
to
mistake
the
laughing
hints
and
suggestions
of
may
and
the
others
she
did
not
know
what
answer
she
would
give
did
he
ask
her
to
marry
him
at
that
concrete
suggestion
her
doze
left
her
and
sitting
up
staring
out
at
the
wonderful
day
into
whose
heart
muffled
lights
were
now
creeping
she
asked
herself
what
indeed
was
her
real
thought
of
him
he
was
to
her
as
were
uncle
john
and
christopher
safe
kind
simple
he
appealed
to
everything
in
her
that
longed
for
life
to
be
clear
comfortable
without
danger
she
loved
his
happiness
in
all
things
horses
and
dogs
and
fields
and
his
little
place
in
sussex
ever
since
that
visit
to
uncle
richard
fans
she
had
suspected
him
of
other
appreciations
and
enthusiasms
perhaps
she
might
in
time
encourage
those
hidden
things
in
him
above
all
did
she
find
him
true
straight
honest
lies
little
mannerisms
disguises
these
were
not
in
him
he
was
as
clear
to
her
as
a
mirror
she
would
trust
him
beyond
anyone
she
knew
he
did
not
touch
in
any
part
of
him
that
other
secret
wild
unreal
life
of
hers
and
indeed
that
was
in
him
the
most
reassuring
thing
of
all
the
rachel
who
was
in
rebellion
to
whom
everything
of
her
london
life
everything
beaminster
was
hateful
whose
sudden
memories
and
instincts
whose
swift
alarms
and
were
so
shattering
to
every
clinging
security
that
life
might
offer
this
rachel
knew
nothing
of
roddy
seddon
he
was
there
to
take
her
away
from
that
to
drive
it
all
into
darkness
to
reassure
her
against
its
return
and
marriage
with
him
would
mean
release
security
best
of
all
freedom
from
her
grandmother
who
knew
so
well
that
life
in
her
and
loved
to
play
with
that
knowledge
her
colour
rose
and
her
eyes
shone
as
she
thought
of
what
this
so
early
escape
from
the
portland
place
house
would
mean
to
her
already
in
her
first
season
to
be
free
of
it
all
to
be
free
of
humbug
and
deception
oh
for
that
would
she
not
surrender
everything
in
the
world
roddy
as
she
pictured
him
with
his
clean
life
his
love
of
nature
his
kindliness
seemed
just
then
the
safest
refuge
that
would
ever
be
offered
to
her
and
at
that
without
reason
she
saw
before
her
her
cousin
francis
breton
several
times
she
had
met
him
since
that
first
occasion
at
lizzie
rand
once
again
at
lizzie
and
twice
in
regent
park
when
she
had
been
walking
with
may
yes
that
was
all
thinking
of
it
now
the
meetings
appeared
to
her
almost
infinite
between
each
actual
encounter
intimacy
seemed
to
leap
in
its
progress
and
although
on
at
least
two
of
them
he
had
only
walked
with
her
for
the
shortest
period
yet
always
with
them
she
was
conscious
of
the
number
of
things
that
between
them
did
not
need
to
be
said
knowledge
that
they
shared
in
all
this
there
was
with
her
a
confusion
of
motives
and
sensations
that
at
present
refused
to
be
disentangled
for
one
thing
there
was
in
all
of
this
a
furtiveness
a
secrecy
that
she
loathed
against
that
was
the
persuasion
that
it
would
be
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
for
her
to
bring
him
back
into
the
beaminster
fold
not
of
course
that
he
should
remain
there
he
was
far
too
strong
and
adventurous
for
that
but
that
accepted
there
he
could
use
it
as
a
board
for
success
and
fortune
let
her
once
as
the
situation
now
was
say
a
word
to
uncle
john
or
the
others
and
that
of
course
was
the
end
she
knew
quite
definitely
that
now
she
wished
that
she
had
never
met
him
he
had
been
during
these
weeks
the
only
influence
that
had
drawn
that
other
rachel
to
the
light
it
was
always
that
other
rachel
that
met
him
someone
alarming
rebellious
conscious
of
unhappiness
and
apprehensive
above
everything
that
in
some
hidden
manner
she
was
being
untrue
to
her
real
self
at
such
moments
it
was
as
though
she
had
blinded
some
force
within
her
muffled
it
stifled
it
because
her
way
through
the
world
was
easier
with
it
so
muffled
so
stifled
at
some
future
time
what
if
there
should
leap
out
upon
her
that
muffled
figure
bursting
its
bonds
refusing
any
longer
to
be
silenced
proclaiming
the
world
no
easy
comfortable
place
but
a
battle
a
fierce
unresting
war
when
she
thought
of
breton
it
was
as
though
she
knew
herself
for
a
coward
as
though
he
had
threatened
to
expose
her
for
one
and
as
though
and
this
was
the
worst
of
all
something
in
her
was
eager
that
he
should
against
this
there
was
the
peace
the
security
that
roddy
could
offer
her
beaminster
security
perhaps
nevertheless
they
were
at
trunton
perth
the
little
station
glittered
in
the
evening
air
it
was
all
suddenly
thrilling
who
would
be
there
what
might
not
happen
before
monday
ii
in
the
high
beautiful
hall
where
they
all
stood
about
and
had
tea
she
could
see
who
they
were
there
was
a
girl
whom
she
had
met
on
several
occasions
this
season
nita
raseley
there
was
a
large
florid
cheerful
person
who
was
she
discovered
maurice
garden
the
and
popular
novelist
there
was
his
wife
there
was
a
thin
intellectual
cousin
of
lady
massiter
miss
rawson
old
and
plain
enough
for
her
cleverness
to
have
turned
to
acidity
roddy
seddon
and
of
course
lord
and
lady
massiter
lord
massiter
was
large
and
florid
like
the
novelist
and
when
they
stood
together
by
the
fireplace
foreign
customs
and
languages
were
suddenly
absurd
so
english
was
the
atmosphere
lady
massiter
was
also
large
but
she
had
the
kind
and
warm
placidity
that
makes
some
women
the
type
of
all
maternity
she
would
be
rachel
felt
a
sure
resource
in
all
time
of
trouble
and
she
would
also
be
entirely
unsatisfactory
as
an
intimate
personal
friend
she
would
like
philanthropists
and
clergymen
love
people
by
the
mass
never
by
the
individual
nita
raseley
was
pink
and
white
with
large
blue
eyes
that
confided
in
everyone
they
looked
at
her
laugh
was
a
little
shrill
her
clothes
very
beautiful
and
men
liked
her
so
there
they
all
were
she
had
said
good
day
to
roddy
and
then
had
moved
away
from
him
governed
by
some
and
the
conviction
that
nita
raseley
blue
eyes
were
upon
her
it
was
all
very
cheerful
and
very
english
as
they
stood
talking
there
and
the
doors
beyond
the
hall
showed
through
their
dark
frames
green
lawns
and
terraces
soaked
in
evening
light
it
was
all
very
very
comfortable
as
she
dressed
for
dinner
rachel
had
her
windows
open
so
hot
was
the
night
and
she
could
watch
the
evening
star
that
shone
with
a
wonderful
brilliance
above
a
dark
little
wood
that
crowned
a
rise
beyond
the
gardens
she
had
a
maid
who
was
very
young
indeed
this
was
her
first
place
but
she
had
during
the
three
months
learnt
with
great
quickness
and
had
attached
herself
to
her
mistress
with
the
most
burning
devotion
she
was
a
silent
unusual
girl
and
kept
herself
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
servants
rachel
as
she
sat
before
her
could
see
in
that
mirror
the
dark
reflection
of
the
twilit
garden
it
a
lovely
place
lucy
yes
miss
rachel
are
you
glad
to
get
away
from
london
it
has
been
hot
there
these
last
weeks
rachel
met
in
the
glass
the
girl
black
eyes
they
were
searching
rachel
face
lucy
would
you
rather
live
in
london
or
in
the
country
i
do
mind
miss
rachel
then
after
a
little
pause
i
hope
give
satisfaction
these
last
weeks
why
yes
of
course
then
i
hope
miss
that
you
allow
me
to
stay
with
you
whether
in
london
or
the
country
the
colour
mounted
to
rachel
cheeks
i
hope
there
be
no
need
for
any
change
she
said
she
found
when
she
came
down
to
the
that
monty
carfax
had
arrived
monty
carfax
was
the
chief
of
the
young
men
who
were
just
at
that
time
entertaining
london
about
half
a
dozen
of
god
creatures
under
thirty
and
perfectly
dressed
with
faces
like
tombstones
and
the
laugh
of
the
peacock
went
from
house
to
house
in
london
and
mocked
at
the
world
they
belonged
as
the
mediæval
jesters
belonged
each
to
his
own
court
and
monty
carfax
certainly
the
cleverest
of
them
was
attached
to
the
beaminster
court
and
served
the
duchess
by
faith
if
not
by
sight
rachel
hated
him
and
always
when
she
found
herself
next
to
him
wrapped
herself
in
her
old
farouche
manner
and
behaved
like
an
awkward
schoolgirl
she
was
terribly
disappointed
at
discovering
that
he
was
going
to
take
her
into
dinner
he
knew
that
she
disliked
him
and
felt
it
a
compliment
that
a
raw
creature
fresh
from
the
schoolroom
should
fail
to
appreciate
him
on
this
occasion
he
devoted
himself
to
the
elderly
massiter
cousin
on
his
other
side
throughout
dinner
they
happily
undressed
the
world
and
found
it
sawdust
rachel
meanwhile
found
maurice
garden
her
other
companion
he
genially
enjoyed
his
dinner
and
talked
in
a
loud
voice
and
prepared
the
answers
that
he
always
gave
to
ladies
who
asked
him
when
he
wrote
whether
he
thought
of
his
plots
or
his
characters
first
and
she
did
hope
he
would
mind
her
saying
that
of
all
his
books
the
one
he
frankly
liked
these
questions
and
was
taken
by
surprise
when
rachel
said
i
never
read
any
of
your
novels
garden
so
i
wo
pretend
he
asked
her
what
she
did
read
have
you
ever
read
anything
by
an
author
called
peter
westcott
westcott
westcott
let
me
see
westcott
well
now
one
of
the
young
men
is
he
yes
he
wrote
a
book
called
ah
yes
i
remember
about
had
quite
a
little
success
as
a
first
book
he
one
of
your
young
men
all
for
art
and
the
rest
of
it
we
all
begin
like
that
miss
beaminster
i
was
like
that
myself
once
she
looked
at
him
coolly
why
did
you
give
it
up
simply
did
pay
you
know
not
a
penny
in
it
and
why
should
there
be
people
do
want
to
know
what
a
young
ass
thinks
about
life
if
he
ca
tell
a
story
all
young
men
think
the
same
green
leaves
moons
and
stars
and
lots
of
symbols
you
know
all
good
enough
if
they
expect
people
to
pay
for
it
i
think
a
fine
book
she
said
and
so
are
some
of
the
others
after
all
everyone
does
want
only
a
plot
in
a
book
he
looked
at
her
with
patronizing
kindness
well
you
see
if
your
westcott
does
change
every
writer
wants
an
audience
whatever
he
may
pretend
and
the
best
way
to
get
a
audience
is
to
give
the
audience
what
it
wants
it
needs
unusual
courage
to
sit
on
a
year
after
year
and
shave
in
a
broken
she
looked
round
the
table
everyone
was
happy
the
butler
was
fat
and
had
the
face
of
a
roman
emperor
the
food
was
very
very
good
nita
raseley
and
roddy
laughed
and
laughed
and
laughed
suddenly
rachel
heart
jumped
in
her
body
oh
she
was
glad
glad
that
roddy
cared
for
her
and
would
look
after
her
because
otherwise
she
did
know
what
violence
she
might
suddenly
commit
what
desperations
she
might
not
engage
upon
what
rebels
and
outlaws
she
would
not
support
what
outlaws
and
then
looking
beyond
the
thickly
curtained
windows
she
could
fancy
that
she
could
see
one
gravely
standing
out
there
on
the
lawn
standing
with
his
one
arm
and
his
pointed
beard
and
his
eyes
appealing
to
be
let
in
then
there
was
an
ice
that
was
so
good
that
peter
westcott
and
francis
breton
seemed
more
outcast
than
ever
iii
after
dinner
when
the
men
had
come
into
the
they
all
went
out
into
the
gardens
it
was
such
a
night
of
stars
as
rachel
had
never
seen
so
dense
an
army
that
all
earth
was
conscious
of
them
the
sky
was
sheeted
silver
here
fading
into
their
clouded
tracery
there
at
fairy
points
drawing
the
dark
woods
and
fields
up
to
its
splendour
with
lines
of
fire
the
world
throbbed
with
stars
was
restless
under
the
glory
of
them
god
walked
in
all
gardens
that
night
at
first
nita
raseley
monty
carfax
rachel
and
roddy
went
together
then
turning
up
a
little
path
into
the
little
wood
that
rose
above
the
garden
rachel
and
roddy
were
alone
they
found
the
trunk
of
a
tree
and
sat
down
behind
them
the
trees
were
thin
enough
to
show
the
stars
below
them
in
a
dusk
lit
by
that
glimmering
lustre
that
starlight
flings
a
glow
that
would
be
flame
were
it
not
dimmed
by
distance
immeasurable
they
could
see
the
lawns
and
hedges
of
the
garden
and
across
the
dark
now
and
again
some
white
figure
showed
for
an
instant
and
was
gone
the
house
behind
the
shadows
rose
sharp
and
black
roddy
looked
big
and
solid
sitting
there
rachel
sat
even
now
uncertain
that
she
did
not
see
francis
breton
in
front
of
her
looking
down
as
she
did
into
the
shadowy
garden
i
hope
she
said
abruptly
that
you
do
like
monty
carfax
i
never
thought
about
him
he
said
he
certainly
no
pal
of
mine
why
because
i
hate
him
she
said
fiercely
what
right
has
he
got
to
on
a
night
like
this
he
always
supposed
to
be
a
very
clever
feller
roddy
said
slowly
but
i
think
him
a
silly
sort
of
ass
knows
nothin
about
dogs
or
horses
ca
play
any
game
only
talks
clever
to
women
i
ca
bear
that
sort
of
man
and
i
do
like
garden
either
so
fat
and
he
loves
his
food
so
do
i
said
roddy
quite
simply
i
love
it
too
it
was
a
jolly
good
dinner
she
said
nothing
and
then
when
he
had
waited
a
little
he
said
anxiously
i
say
miss
beaminster
we
been
such
jolly
good
friends
all
these
weeks
and
yet
sometimes
i
afraid
you
think
me
the
most
awful
fool
she
laughed
i
think
you
are
about
some
things
but
then
so
am
i
about
a
good
many
things
most
of
your
things
look
here
miss
beaminster
i
wish
you
help
me
about
things
i
an
ass
in
you
can
you
know
i
be
most
awfully
glad
what
she
said
turning
round
and
facing
him
are
the
things
you
really
care
about
the
things
care
about
yes
really
well
oh
animals
and
bein
out
in
the
open
and
shootin
and
ridin
and
fishin
any
old
exercise
and
comin
up
to
town
for
a
buck
every
now
and
again
and
then
goin
back
and
seein
no
one
and
my
old
place
and
oh
i
do
know
he
ended
you
would
tell
anyone
a
lie
would
you
about
things
you
liked
and
did
like
it
would
be
much
use
if
i
did
he
said
laughing
they
find
me
out
in
a
minute
no
but
would
you
if
you
were
with
a
number
of
people
who
thought
art
the
thing
to
care
about
and
knew
nothing
about
dogs
and
horses
would
you
say
you
cared
about
art
more
than
anything
no
he
said
slowly
no
but
sometimes
you
see
pictures
and
music
and
such
do
please
me
like
anything
i
ca
put
into
words
but
i
might
suddenly
be
in
any
old
mood
for
pictures
or
your
uncle
fans
or
dogs
or
the
empire
or
these
jolly
old
stars
why
there
you
see
i
just
let
it
go
on
the
mood
i
mean
till
it
over
then
he
added
with
a
great
sigh
but
i
am
a
dash
fool
at
explainin
but
i
know
you
would
be
like
garden
or
carfax
just
pretending
not
to
like
the
thing
because
it
the
thing
not
to
or
like
aunt
adela
who
picks
up
a
phrase
about
a
book
or
picture
from
some
clever
man
and
then
uses
it
everywhere
i
should
never
remember
it
a
phrase
or
anythin
i
never
can
remember
what
a
feller
says
oh
i
know
you
always
be
honest
about
these
things
i
feel
you
would
about
everything
it
all
these
lies
that
are
so
impossible
i
think
i
come
to
feel
now
after
this
first
season
that
the
only
thing
that
matters
is
being
straight
it
is
the
only
thing
if
a
person
just
gives
you
what
they
got
what
got
not
what
someone
else
is
supposed
to
have
may
eversley
used
to
say
that
people
minds
are
like
soup
thick
or
clear
but
they
only
thick
because
they
let
them
get
thick
with
other
people
opinions
you
do
mind
all
this
she
said
suddenly
pausing
afraid
lest
he
should
be
bored
it
most
awfully
interestin
he
said
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
there
are
some
men
and
women
i
met
one
or
two
who
just
made
up
of
truth
you
know
it
the
minute
you
with
them
and
they
have
pluck
too
of
course
courage
goes
with
it
our
family
she
ended
are
of
course
the
most
terrible
liars
that
have
ever
been
ever
oh
i
say
he
began
protesting
oh
but
yes
they
run
everything
on
it
my
uncle
richard
ran
through
parliament
beautifully
because
he
never
said
what
he
meant
and
aunt
adela
uncle
john
although
he
a
dear
but
then
my
grandmother
brought
them
up
to
it
my
grandmother
would
have
about
three
clever
people
and
then
muddle
all
the
rest
so
that
the
three
clever
ones
can
have
everything
in
their
hands
look
here
he
broke
in
i
most
awfully
fond
of
your
grandmother
we
tremendous
pals
you
may
be
i
hate
her
oh
i
do
hate
her
with
melodrama
i
want
to
strangle
her
or
beat
her
face
or
burn
her
but
i
frightened
of
her
and
she
always
making
me
do
things
i
ashamed
of
that
the
best
reason
for
hating
anyone
there
is
but
she
such
a
sportsman
one
of
the
old
kind
one
oh
i
know
all
that
you
can
say
i
heard
it
so
many
times
but
she
all
wrong
there
is
any
good
in
her
she
just
remorseless
and
selfish
and
stubborn
she
thinks
she
ran
the
world
once
and
she
wants
to
do
it
still
that
all
rather
fine
think
said
roddy
i
agree
with
her
a
bit
i
think
most
people
have
to
be
run
they
just
ca
run
themselves
so
you
have
to
put
things
into
them
well
that
just
where
we
differ
she
said
sharply
it
is
so
that
where
all
the
muddle
comes
in
if
everyone
were
just
himself
without
anything
oh
the
brave
world
it
be
then
she
laughed
but
i
all
wrong
myself
you
know
i
as
muddled
as
anyone
i
got
all
the
true
real
me
there
but
all
the
beaminster
part
has
slurred
it
over
but
i
got
a
horrid
fear
that
truth
gets
tired
of
waiting
too
long
one
day
when
you
not
expecting
it
it
comes
up
and
says
you
choose
your
only
chance
you
going
to
use
me
or
not
if
not
i
going
how
awful
if
one
did
realize
the
moment
was
there
and
missed
it
she
was
laughing
but
in
her
heart
that
other
woman
in
her
was
stirring
for
a
startled
trembling
second
the
wood
seemed
to
flame
the
gardens
to
blaze
with
the
challenge
are
you
for
the
sake
of
the
comfort
and
safety
of
life
playing
false
which
way
are
you
going
she
burst
into
laughter
she
caught
roddy
by
the
arm
oh
i
talked
such
nonsense
it
getting
cold
we
got
to
go
in
do
think
i
talk
like
that
generally
sir
roderick
because
i
do
i
she
was
nervous
frightened
the
stars
were
so
many
and
it
was
so
dark
and
roddy
no
longer
seemed
a
protection
i
know
it
late
look
here

going

she
tore
for
her
very
life
out
of
the
little
wood
felt
him
pounding
behind
her
seized
with
a
gasp
of
relief
the
lights
and
the
voices
she
knew
with
joy
that
roddy
was
closing
the
door
behind
her
and
that
the
garden
and
the
stars
and
the
wood
were
shut
into
silence
for
a
little
while
in
the
she
talked
excitedly
laughed
a
great
deal
even
at
monty
carfax
jokes
she
knew
that
they
were
all
thinking
that
she
was
pleased
because
she
had
been
with
roddy
she
did
not
care
what
their
thoughts
were
at
last
in
her
room
she
cried
to
lucy
pull
the
curtains
tight
tighter
tighter
those
stars
they
get
through
anything
when
at
last
lucy
was
gone
she
lit
her
candle
and
lay
there
hearing
the
clocks
strike
the
hours
wondering
when
the
day
would
come

roddy
dozing
after
a
night
of
glorious
sleep
lay
on
his
back
and
swung
happily
to
and
fro
the
footman
who
was
valeting
him
had
pulled
up
the
blind
and
drawn
aside
the
curtains
and
the
garden
came
to
him
not
as
on
last
evening
weighed
with
its
canopy
of
stars
but
now
asserting
its
own
happiness
and
colour
and
freshness

what

sir
roddy
stared
at
him
and
smiled
after
a
little
time
the
man
enquired
again
which
suit
will
you
wear
this
morning
sir
dark

roddy
still
happily
floating
somewhere
near
the
ceiling
floating
with
delicious
lightness
dark

dark
blue
dark
blue
for
a
little
while
the
man
a
strange
vague
shape
pulled
out
drawers
and
closed
them
and
walked
about
the
floor
like
agag
delicately
roddy
from
the
ceiling
watched
him
and
resented
the
fact
that
every
sharp
click
of
a
drawer
pulled
him
nearer
to
the
carpet
the
man
final
shutting
of
the
bedroom
door
plumped
roddy
into
his
bed
wide
awake
damn
him
what
a
wonderful
day
he
lay
back
and
watched
how
waves
of
light
danced
on
the
walls
a
fountain
splashed
in
the
gardens
and
the
long
mirror
on
the
right
of
the
bed
had
in
it
the
corner
of
the
green
lawn
and
the
cool
grey
stones
of
an
old
wall
roddy
lay
on
his
back
and
allowed
his
sensations
to
run
up
and
down
his
body
it
was
for
moments
such
as
this
that
his
life
was
intended
he
lived
deliberately
and
without
any
selfishness
in
the
matter
for
the
emotions
that
the
good
old
god
pan
might
choose
to
provide
for
him
he
did
not
know
pan
by
name
except
as
a
silly
fancy
dress
that
monty
carfax
had
once
worn
at
a
dance
and
as
someone
alluded
to
every
now
and
again
vaguely
in
the
papers
but
even
though
he
did
not
call
him
by
name
he
nevertheless
paid
without
question
his
daily
homage
when
as
on
this
beautiful
morning
one
had
only
to
lie
down
and
be
instantly
conscious
of
a
thousand
things
sheep
moving
slowly
across
hills
cattle
browing
in
deep
pools
those
downs
that
he
loved
rising
slowly
like
aged
men
to
greet
a
new
day
then
one
questioned
nothing
one
argued
nothing
one
needed
no
words
one
was
happy
from
the
crown
of
one
head
to
the
toes
of
one
feet
on
this
especial
morning
these
delights
were
connected
with
the
fact
that
during
the
day
he
intended
to
propose
marriage
to
rachel
beaminster
he
thought
of
her
now
as
she
had
looked
last
night
sitting
in
that
wood
in
a
pale
blue
dress
with
the
stars
behind
her
staring
so
seriously
down
into
the
garden
she
had
been
very
beautiful
last
night
and
it
had
been
a
splendid
moment
not
more
splendid
than
other
moments
that
he
had
had
but
splendid
enough
to
remember
he
was
always
prepared
for
the
necessity
of
the
short
duration
of
his
sensations
he
had
discovered
when
he
was
very
young
that
nothing
lasted
and
that
the
things
that
lasted
the
shortest
time
were
generally
the
best
things
and
therefore
he
had
quite
unconsciously
trained
himself
to
store
his
memory
with
splendid
moments
now
although
he
had
no
memory
at
all
for
any
sort
of
facts
or
books
or
histories
he
could
recall
precisely
in
all
their
forms
and
colours
scenes
persons
adventures
that
had
at
any
time
thrilled
him
he
could
remember
days
once
when
as
a
little
boy
he
had
been
overtaken
by
night
on
the
downs
and
had
sheltered
in
a
deserted
house
black
and
evil
that
had
he
afterwards
discovered
been
in
the
eighteenth
century
a
private
once
when
the
sea
had
been
green
and
purple
the
sky
black
and
he
had
discovered
a
for
the
first
time
very
young
on
that
occasion
once
when
his
horse
had
run
away
with
him
and
the
danger
had
been
exceeded
by
the
glorious
speed
through
the
air
many
many
others
all
to
be
counted
by
him
to
their
very
least
detail
and
now
of
some
of
them
rachel
beaminster
was
the
central
figure
he
had
had
relations
of
many
kinds
with
many
different
women
and
never
until
now
had
he
supposed
for
an
instant
that
these
relations
would
be
permanent
even
now
although
he
was
intending
to
marry
rachel
beaminster
he
was
not
so
foolish
as
to
imagine
that
the
freshness
and
novelty
of
the
feeling
that
he
now
had
for
her
would
last
more
than
a
very
short
time
quite
deliberately
he
treasured
up
in
his
mind
a
thousand
pictures
of
her
as
he
had
seen
her
during
the
last
two
months
so
that
when
the
time
came
for
seeing
her
no
longer
in
that
way
he
would
have
his
memories
there
was
the
time
of
her
first
ball
all
excitement
and
happiness
the
day
at
her
uncle
when
she
had
looked
at
him
over
the
top
of
the
fans
the
night
at
the
opera
when
she
had
been
so
angry
with
him
last
night
she
had
through
all
this
time
remained
elusive
he
did
not
know
her
could
not
reconcile
one
inconsistency
with
another
but
he
thought
that
she
cared
about
him
and
would
marry
him
he
had
always
known
that
he
must
one
day
marry
that
necessity
was
in
no
way
connected
with
the
emotional
side
of
him
it
rather
had
its
relationship
with
the
common
sense
of
him
the
part
that
believed
in
the
beaminsters
and
all
their
glory
he
must
marry
because
seddon
court
must
have
a
mistress
because
he
himself
must
have
children
because
he
would
like
to
have
someone
there
to
be
kind
to
that
need
in
him
for
bestowing
kindness
upon
someone
was
always
most
urgent
and
all
sorts
of
animals
and
all
sorts
of
persons
had
shared
it
now
one
person
would
have
it
all
he
could
not
bear
to
hurt
anyone
or
anything
and
the
crises
of
his
life
were
provided
by
those
occasions
when
in
the
delight
of
one
of
his
emotional
moments
hurting
somebody
was
involved
there
was
always
then
a
conflict
he
knew
that
it
was
just
here
that
the
duchess
failed
to
understand
him
she
liked
hurting
people
and
expected
him
to
be
amused
when
she
told
him
little
stories
about
her
having
done
so
he
had
now
a
kind
of
dim
feeling
that
it
was
because
the
duchess
hoped
that
he
was
going
to
hurt
rachel
that
she
had
prosecuted
so
strenuously
his
marriage
he
trusted
with
all
his
heart
that
he
would
never
hurt
rachel
he
intended
always
to
be
very
very
kind
to
her
it
was
indeed
a
thousand
pities
that
the
present
quality
of
his
attitude
to
her
must
like
all
attitudes
eventually
change
but
he
was
always
he
was
sure
of
this
going
to
be
good
to
her
and
give
her
everything
that
the
mistress
of
seddon
court
should
have
at
the
same
time
vaguely
he
wished
that
the
old
duchess
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
sometimes
he
wondered
whether
the
side
in
him
that
found
pleasure
in
her
was
really
natural
to
him
whenever
he
thought
of
her
she
in
some
way
confused
his
judgment
and
made
life
difficult
she
was
doing
that
now
ii
when
he
came
down
to
breakfast
he
found
that
he
was
the
last
he
sat
next
to
nita
raseley
and
was
conscious
after
a
little
time
that
she
was
behaving
with
a
certain
reserve
he
had
known
her
in
the
kind
of
way
that
he
knew
many
people
in
his
own
set
in
london
pleasantly
indifferently
without
curiosity
she
had
however
attracted
him
sometimes
by
the
impression
that
she
gave
him
that
she
was
too
young
to
know
many
men
but
however
long
she
lived
would
never
find
anyone
as
splendid
as
he
she
had
certainly
never
been
reserved
before
finally
he
realized
that
she
expected
to
hear
of
his
engagement
to
rachel
beaminster
at
any
moment
well
so
she
will
he
thought
smiling
to
himself
meanwhile
he
avoided
rachel
quite
deliberately
he
was
now
about
her
and
did
not
wish
to
be
with
her
until
he
could
ask
her
to
marry
him
no
more
uncertainty
was
possible
he
felt
not
frightened
but
excited
just
as
he
would
feel
were
he
about
to
ride
a
dangerous
horse
for
the
first
time
he
seized
with
relief
upon
the
proposal
of
church
he
wanted
the
morning
to
pass
his
prayer
was
that
she
would
not
walk
to
church
with
him
because
he
had
now
nothing
to
say
to
her
except
the
one
thing
when
he
heard
that
she
was
staying
behind
and
walking
with
nita
raseley
he
was
surprised
at
his
own
sense
of
release
lady
adela
was
kind
to
him
this
morning
in
a
sort
of
motherly
way
and
apparently
seized
on
his
going
to
church
as
an
omen
of
his
future
married
happiness
they
all
waiting
to
hear
he
said
to
himself
they
were
to
walk
across
the
park
to
the
little
village
church
and
when
they
set
out
he
was
conscious
that
lord
john
like
a
large
and
amiable
bird
was
hovering
about
him
finally
lord
john
nervous
apparently
most
certainly
embarrassed
settled
upon
him
going
to
church
are
you
roddy
yes
beaminster
well
let
strike
off
together
shall
we
roddy
liked
lord
john
best
of
the
beaminster
brothers
the
duke
he
could
not
endure
and
lord
richard
was
so
superior
but
johnny
beaminster
was
as
amiable
as
an
easter
egg
and
fond
of
race
meetings
and
pretty
women
and
not
too
dam
clever
in
fact
really
not
clever
at
all
but
johnny
beaminster
embarrassed
was
another
matter
and
roddy
found
soon
that
this
embarrassment
led
to
his
own
confusion
lord
john
flung
out
little
remarks
and
little
whistles
because
of
the
heat
and
little
comments
upon
the
crops
he
obviously
had
something
that
he
very
much
wanted
to
say
of
course
thought
roddy
this
is
something
to
do
with
rachel
he
very
fond
of
rachel
although
johnny
beaminster
had
not
in
strict
accuracy
himself
the
reputation
of
the
whitest
of
puritans
yet
roddy
wondered
whether
perhaps
he
were
not
now
worrying
over
some
of
roddy
past
history
as
rumoured
in
london
society
does
want
his
girl
to
be
handed
over
to
a
black
sheep
should
wonder
thought
roddy
and
this
led
him
to
rather
indignant
consideration
of
the
confusion
of
the
beaminster
mind
and
its
muddled
moralities
the
walk
to
the
church
was
not
very
long
but
it
became
towards
the
close
of
it
quite
awful
in
its
agitation
dam
hot
said
lord
john
very
said
roddy
would
wonder
if
this
weather
broke
soon
quite
likely
makes
you
hot
walking
to
church
this
hour
of
the
morning
yes
do
it
farmers
will
be
wantin
rain
pretty
badly
down
at
my
little
place
they
tell
me
it
dried
up
like
anythin
turkish
bath
well
the
church
ought
to
be
cool
you
never
know
with
these
churches
roddy
thought
he
afraid
of
his
old
mother
does
want
me
to
marry
rachel
but
he
afraid
of
his
old
mother
massiter
getting
fat
this
was
lord
john
contribution
yes
so
that
novelist
feller
oh
garden
yes
ever
read
anything
of
his
never
a
line
never
read
novels
not
bad
good
tales
you
know
he
probably
roddy
thought
had
a
row
with
the
old
lady
about
me
then
strangely
enough
the
notion
hit
him
wish
it
was
he
wanted
me
to
marry
rachel
and
the
duchess
did
wish
she
did
by
gad
as
they
entered
the
church
roddy
might
have
seen
had
he
been
gifted
in
psychology
that
there
was
in
lord
john
face
the
look
of
a
man
who
had
fought
a
battle
with
his
dark
angel
and
been
alas
defeated
iii
after
luncheon
roddy
said
miss
beaminster
come
for
a
walk
a
little
way
she
said
looking
at
him
with
her
eyes
in
that
straight
direct
way
that
she
had
she
must
know
said
roddy
to
himself
that
i
going
to
do
it
now
they
all
know
it
awful
some
of
the
others
had
gathered
together
under
a
great
oak
that
shaded
the
central
lawn
and
now
as
he
climbed
the
hill
with
his
capture
he
felt
that
from
beneath
that
tree
many
eyes
watched
them
they
did
not
go
very
far
at
the
top
of
the
hill
above
the
little
wood
and
the
gardens
and
the
house
there
was
a
grassy
hollow
and
under
this
grassy
hollow
a
great
field
of
wheat
a
sheet
of
with
sudden
waves
and
ripples
in
it
as
though
some
hand
were
shaking
it
ran
down
to
the
valley
let
stop
here
rachel
said
i
was
out
all
this
morning
with
nita
raseley
and
it
too
hot
for
any
exertion
whatever
a
tree
shaded
them
and
they
sat
down
and
watched
corn
what
sort
of
a
girl
do
you
think
she
is
nita
raseley
i
mean
asked
rachel
oh
i
do
know
the
ordinary
kind
of
girl
why
she
seems
to
want
to
know
me
says
that
she
has
many
friends
is
that
true
i
thought
she
had
heaps
you
never
can
tell
with
girls
you
all
so
uncertain
about
one
another
devoted
one
moment
and
enemies
the
next
are
we
said
rachel
slowly
i
do
think
i
like
that
oh
how
hot
it
is
she
lay
back
against
the
grass
with
her
arms
behind
her
head
do
you
like
me
roddy
said
suddenly
i
you
she
slowly
sat
up
and
he
saw
at
once
that
she
knew
now
what
he
was
going
to
say
at
that
moment
sitting
there
staring
at
him
with
her
breasts
moving
a
little
beneath
her
white
dress
and
her
hands
pressing
flatly
against
the
grass
in
her
agitation
and
the
look
in
her
eyes
of
some
suddenly
evoked
personality
that
he
did
not
know
at
all
she
was
more
elusive
to
him
than
she
had
ever
been
she
was
frightened
and
also
glad
but
the
change
in
her
from
the
girl
he
had
known
all
the
summer
was
so
startling
that
he
felt
that
he
was
about
to
propose
to
someone
he
had
never
seen
before
do
i
like
you
she
repeated
slowly
and
her
lips
parted
in
a
smile
yes
he
said
looking
at
her
hands
that
seemed
to
belong
to
the
earth
into
which
they
were
pressing
because
i
want
you
to
marry
me
the
moment
of
her
surprise
had
come
before
now
she
only
said
very
quietly
why
what
do
you
know
about
me
i
know
enough
to
ask
you
he
said
stumbling
over
his
words
he
was
now
afraid
that
after
all
she
intended
to
refuse
him
and
the
terror
of
this
made
his
heart
stop
no
words
would
come
he
stared
at
her
with
all
the
fright
in
his
eyes
roddy
she
had
never
called
him
that
before
do
you
care
then
she
stopped
she
began
again
i
do
want
to
talk
nonsense
i
want
to
say
exactly
what
i
feel
i
suppose
most
girls
would
want
to
be
free
a
little
longer
would
want
to
have
a
good
time
another
two
or
three
seasons
but
i
do
i
hate
being
free
i
want
somebody
to
keep
me
to
prevent
my
doing
silly
things
to
look
after
me
and
i
rather
you
did
it
than
anybody
else
then
she
went
on
quickly
but
it
is
more
than
that
i
do
like
you
most
awfully
only
i
suppose
i
not
the
kind
of
girl
to
be
frantically
excited
to
be
wild
about
it
all
i
not
that
i
do
like
you
better
than
any
other
man
i
know
is
that
enough
i
think
we
can
be
most
awfully
good
pals
always
he
said
oh
she
cried
suddenly
putting
her
hand
on
his
and
looking
straight
into
his
face
that
what
i
want
that
that
if
that
it
and
you
think
we
can
why
then
i
rather
marry
you
roddy
dear
than
anyone
in
the
world
then
it
settled
he
said
but
he
did
not
take
her
hand
or
touch
her
they
sat
for
quite
a
long
time
looking
at
the
rippling
corn
and
the
house
that
was
like
a
white
boat
sailing
on
the
green
far
below
them
they
said
no
word
then
without
speaking
they
got
up
from
the
grass
and
walked
down
the
path
to
the
little
wood
but
when
they
came
to
the
place
where
they
had
been
the
night
before
he
caught
her
to
him
so
furiously
that
his
own
body
was
bent
back
and
he
kissed
her
again
and
again
and
again

broken
robert
bridges
i
in
the
early
days
of
the
december
of
that
year
the
first
snow
fell
francis
breton
standing
at
his
window
high
up
in
the
saxton
square
house
watched
the
first
flakes
as
they
came
lingering
from
the
heavy
brooding
sky
as
he
watched
a
great
tide
of
unhappiness
and
restlessness
and
discontent
swept
over
him
his
was
a
temperament
that
could
be
raised
to
heaven
and
dashed
to
hell
in
a
second
of
time
life
never
showed
him
its
true
colours
and
his
sensitive
suspicion
to
the
signs
and
omens
of
the
gods
gave
him
radiant
confidence
and
utter
despair
when
only
a
patient
quiescence
had
been
intended
during
the
last
three
months
he
had
risen
and
fallen
and
risen
again
as
the
impulse
to
do
something
magnificent
somewhere
interchanged
with
the
impulse
to
do
something
desperate
meanwhile
nothing
was
done
and
standing
now
staring
at
the
snow
he
realized
it
he
had
never
in
all
his
days
known
how
to
moderate
if
he
might
not
be
the
hero
of
society
then
must
he
be
the
famous
outcast
in
one
fashion
or
another
london
must
ring
with
his
name
and
yet
now
here
had
he
been
in
london
since
the
end
of
april
and
nothing
had
occurred
no
steps
beyond
that
first
letter
to
his
grandmother
had
he
taken
he
had
not
even
responded
to
the
advances
made
to
him
by
his
old
associates
he
had
seen
no
one
save
christopher
brun
once
or
twice
the
rands
and
his
cousin
rachel
throughout
this
time
he
had
done
what
he
had
never
done
before
he
had
waited
for
what
a
little
perhaps
he
had
expected
that
the
family
would
take
some
step
looking
back
now
he
knew
that
the
shadow
of
his
grandmother
had
been
over
it
all
he
had
always
seen
her
when
he
had
contemplated
any
action
seen
her
and
deny
it
as
he
might
feared
her
she
confused
his
mind
he
had
never
been
very
readily
clear
as
to
reasons
and
instincts
he
had
never
paused
for
a
period
long
enough
to
allow
clear
thinking
but
now
through
all
these
weeks
he
had
been
conscious
that
that
same
clear
thinking
would
have
come
to
him
had
not
his
grandmother
clouded
his
mind
he
felt
her
as
one
feels
in
a
dream
some
power
that
prevents
our
movement
holds
us
fascinated
so
now
he
was
held
the
other
great
force
persuading
him
to
inaction
was
rachel
beaminster
now
rachel
seddon
long
before
his
return
to
england
the
thought
of
this
cousin
of
his
had
often
come
to
him
he
would
speculate
about
her
she
like
himself
was
by
birth
half
a
rebel
she
be
she
be
he
had
sometimes
thought
that
he
would
write
to
her
and
then
he
had
felt
that
that
would
not
be
fair
behind
all
his
dreams
and
romances
he
always
saw
some
destiny
whose
colours
were
woven
simply
for
him
francis
breton
and
this
confidence
in
an
especial
personally
constructed
god
had
been
responsible
for
his
wildest
and
most
foolish
mistakes
often
had
he
seen
this
especial
god
bringing
his
cousin
and
himself
together
always
he
had
known
that
in
some
way
they
two
were
to
be
chosen
to
work
out
together
vengeance
and
destruction
against
all
the
beaminsters
when
therefore
that
meeting
in
the
rands
had
taken
place
he
had
accepted
it
all
she
was
even
more
wonderful
than
he
had
expected
but
he
had
known
instantly
that
she
was
his
companion
his
chosen
his
between
them
he
had
realized
a
claim
implied
on
some
common
knowledge
or
experience
at
the
first
moment
of
their
meeting
from
the
age
of
ten
when
he
had
been
petted
by
one
of
his
mistresses
his
life
had
been
entangled
with
women
some
he
had
loved
others
he
had
been
in
love
with
others
again
had
he
did
not
know
now
whether
he
were
in
love
with
rachel
or
no
he
only
knew
that
the
whole
current
of
his
life
was
changed
from
the
moment
that
he
met
her
and
that
until
the
end
of
it
she
now
would
be
intermingled
with
all
his
history
at
first
so
sure
had
he
been
of
the
workings
of
fate
in
this
matter
that
he
had
been
content
for
the
first
time
in
all
his
days
to
wait
with
his
hands
folded
during
this
period
all
thought
of
action
against
the
beaminsters
on
the
one
hand
or
a
relapse
into
the
company
of
the
friends
of
his
earlier
london
days
on
the
other
had
been
out
of
the
question
this
certainty
of
rachel
future
alliance
with
himself
had
made
such
things
impossibly
absurd
then
had
come
the
announcement
of
her
engagement
to
seddon
for
a
moment
the
shock
had
been
terrific
he
had
suddenly
seen
the
face
of
his
especial
god
and
it
was
blind
and
stupid
and
dead
then
swiftly
upon
that
had
come
thought
of
his
grandmother
this
was
of
course
her
doing
rachel
was
too
young
to
know
she
would
discover
her
mistake
the
engagement
would
be
broken
off
during
this
time
he
had
met
rachel
on
several
occasions
and
although
the
meetings
had
been
very
brief
yet
always
he
had
felt
that
same
unacknowledged
secret
intimacy
after
every
meeting
his
confidence
had
risen
once
again
to
the
skies
then
had
come
the
news
of
her
marriage
from
that
moment
he
had
known
no
peace
at
first
he
had
wildly
fancied
that
this
had
happened
because
he
had
not
come
to
her
and
more
plainly
declared
himself
his
picture
of
her
idea
of
him
was
confused
with
all
the
dramatic
untruth
of
idea
of
her
then
interchanging
with
that
had
come
moods
when
he
had
seen
things
more
plainly
as
they
were
and
had
told
himself
that
all
relations
between
herself
and
him
had
been
invented
by
himself
that
any
kindness
that
she
had
shown
him
had
been
kindness
sprung
from
pity
during
the
early
months
of
the
autumn
rachel
and
her
husband
were
abroad
and
during
this
time
breton
told
himself
that
he
was
waiting
for
her
return
before
taking
any
action
then
a
certain
pont
a
lady
whose
beauty
had
been
increased
but
her
reputation
lessened
by
several
scandals
and
a
tiresomely
querulous
pont
had
suggested
to
francis
breton
a
continuation
of
certain
earlier
relationships
he
knew
himself
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
one
evening
in
company
would
put
an
end
to
his
struggles
so
weak
was
he
in
his
own
knowledge
that
the
only
possible
evading
of
a
conflict
was
by
the
denial
of
the
enemy
very
existence
he
denied
pont
and
throughout
those
dark
gloomy
autumn
weeks
clinging
to
christopher
and
lizzie
rand
waited
to
hear
of
return
although
he
would
confess
it
to
no
man
alive
he
longed
now
with
an
aching
heart
for
some
sort
of
reconciliation
with
the
family
he
would
have
astonished
them
with
his
humility
had
they
given
him
any
sign
or
signal
he
fancied
that
lord
john
or
even
the
duke
might
come
once
admitted
to
his
proper
rank
again
and
what
a
citizen
he
would
be
vanish
for
ever
pont
and
her
tribe
and
all
that
dark
underworld
that
waited
like
some
sluggish
but
confident
monster
for
his
inevitable
descent
wild
phantasmic
plans
crossed
his
brain
every
hour
of
every
day
nothing
came
of
it
all
only
when
at
last
it
was
announced
that
sir
roderick
and
lady
seddon
had
returned
to
england
he
discovered
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
nothing
to
say
no
step
to
take
that
return
had
been
at
the
end
of
october
from
then
until
the
end
of
november
he
waited
expecting
that
she
would
write
to
him
still
by
this
anticipation
were
pont
and
pont
world
kept
at
bay
no
word
came
driven
now
to
take
some
step
that
would
shatter
this
silence
he
wrote
to
her
a
long
letter
about
nothing
very
much
only
something
that
would
bring
him
a
line
from
her
for
ten
days
now
he
had
waited
and
there
had
come
no
word
as
these
first
flakes
of
snow
softly
relentlessly
fell
past
his
window
the
nebulous
cloud
of
all
the
uncertainties
disappointments
rebellions
of
this
pointless
wasted
thing
that
men
called
life
crystallized
into
form
i
no
good
life
like
this
it
impossible
i
no
good
against
it
i
better
climb
down
and
here
the
irony
of
it
was
that
he
never
climbed
the
awful
moments
in
life
are
those
that
threaten
us
by
their
suspension
of
all
action
just
feel
what
piling
up
for
you
out
of
all
this
silence
they
seem
to
say
breton
trouble
now
was
that
he
did
not
know
in
what
direction
to
move
his
relation
to
rachel
was
so
nebulous
that
it
could
scarcely
be
called
a
relation
at
all
he
only
knew
that
she
alone
was
the
person
for
whom
now
life
was
worth
combating
he
had
told
her
in
his
letter
that
she
could
help
him
and
the
absence
of
an
answer
spoke
now
in
this
threatening
silence
with
mighty
reverberating
voice
she
does
care
well
then
who
else
is
there
almost
he
could
have
fancied
that
his
grandmother
there
in
the
portland
place
house
was
withdrawing
from
him
all
the
supports
in
which
he
trusted
now
the
snow
falling
ever
more
swiftly
ever
more
stealthily
seemed
to
be
with
him
in
the
room
stifling
choking
blinding
he
felt
that
if
he
could
not
find
company
of
some
kind
he
would
go
mad
and
so
leaving
the
storm
and
the
silence
behind
him
in
his
room
he
went
to
find
lizzie
rand
ii
lizzie
rand
did
not
conceal
from
herself
now
that
she
loved
him
so
long
had
her
emotional
life
been
waiting
there
undesired
that
now
it
could
be
kept
by
her
utterly
apart
from
her
daily
habit
but
it
became
a
flame
a
fire
that
lighted
with
its
splendid
warmth
and
colour
the
whole
of
her
accustomed
world
she
indulged
it
now
without
restraint
through
the
long
dark
autumn
she
had
it
treasured
there
she
did
not
as
things
then
were
ask
for
more
than
this
splendid
knowledge
that
there
was
now
someone
upon
whom
she
loved
to
spend
her
care
she
had
not
loved
to
spend
it
upon
her
mother
and
sister
but
that
had
been
a
duty
defined
and
necessary
now
everything
that
she
could
do
for
breton
was
more
fuel
to
fling
to
her
flame
that
further
question
as
to
whether
he
might
care
for
her
she
kept
just
in
sight
but
nevertheless
not
definite
enough
to
risk
the
absolute
challenge
at
least
now
as
the
weeks
passed
he
sought
her
company
more
and
more
she
helped
him
she
cheered
and
comforted
him
enough
for
her
present
need
even
beyond
it
all
could
she
survey
herself
humorously
this
the
first
love
affair
of
her
life
made
her
smile
at
her
capture
and
defeat
well
i
just
like
the
rest
and
oh
i
glad
i
glad
that
i
am
finally
she
knew
that
there
was
still
a
step
that
might
be
taken
between
them
at
any
moment
he
had
she
knew
something
to
tell
her
again
and
again
lately
he
had
been
about
to
speak
and
then
had
caught
the
impulse
back
this
too
she
would
not
examine
too
closely
but
from
the
moment
that
he
should
demand
from
her
definite
concrete
assistance
from
that
moment
she
would
be
to
him
what
she
knew
no
one
now
living
could
claim
to
be
breton
was
glad
when
the
little
maid
told
him
that
rand
was
out
but
that
miss
lizzie
was
at
home
he
saw
her
in
the
warm
cosy
room
sitting
before
the
fire
with
her
toes
on
the
fender
and
her
skirts
pulled
up
drying
her
shoes
she
looked
up
and
smiled
at
him
and
told
him
to
sit
down
but
did
not
move
from
her
position
mother
out
at
a
matinee
with
daisy
i
got
away
early
this
afternoon
do
you
hate
snow
mr
breton
i
hate
it
i
got
the
dumps
i
had
to
find
someone
to
talk
to
or
i
have
gone
screaming
into
the
street
could
find
anyone
better
so
took
me
thank
you
for
the
compliment
but
i
like
the
snow
your
pool
more
like
a
pool
now
than
ever
mr
breton
he
went
across
to
the
window
and
stood
there
looking
at
the
little
square
now
white
with
the
gaunt
trees
rising
black
from
the
heart
of
it
and
the
grey
houses
that
hemmed
it
in
over
it
the
snow
yellow
and
grey
and
then
delicately
white
swirled
and
tossed
he
came
back
and
sat
down
beside
her
and
wondered
at
her
neat
comfort
and
air
of
calm
control
of
all
her
emotions
and
desires
she
looking
at
him
saw
that
he
was
ill
dark
lines
beneath
his
eyes
his
cheeks
pale
and
an
air
of
picturesque
melancholy
that
made
her
want
first
to
laugh
at
him
and
then
mother
him
i
know
what
the
matter
with
you
she
said
nodding
her
head
what
something
to
do
that
what
you
want
she
turned
towards
him
looking
at
him
with
a
little
smile
and
yet
with
grave
seriousness
in
her
eyes
oh
breton
why
do
you
what
is
the
use
of
sitting
here
month
after
month
doing
nothing
just
waiting
for
something
to
happen
something
that
ca
happen
unless
you
make
it
things
fall
into
people
mouths
just
because
they
sit
with
them
open
he
coloured
everybody
always
scolding
me
he
said
christopher
you
everybody
nobody
understands
how
difficult
he
broke
off
so
intangible
were
his
difficulties
that
no
words
would
define
them
and
yet
god
knew
they
were
real
enough
i
know
she
said
nodding
her
head
it
the
thought
of
them
all
at
portland
place
that
holding
you
back
you
began
by
fancying
that
you
wanted
to
cut
their
throats
and
you
still
would
mind
slaughtering
them
if
only
they
in
their
turn
would
do
something
definite
it
their
doing
that
just
holds
you
up
but
really
as
long
as
your
grandmother
alive
i
afraid
that
it
no
good
thinking
of
them
when
she
dead
and
she
live
for
ever
anything
may
happen
meanwhile
why
not
show
them
what
you
do
but
what
i
do
he
answered
her
fiercely
i
never
been
brought
up
to
do
anything
except
what
i
ought
there
my
arm
and
one
thing
and
another
besides
there
more
than
that
in
it
miss
rand
it
the
fact
that
well
that
there
nobody
that
cares
that
so
freezing
if
only
somebody
minded
as
he
spoke
rachel
rose
beautifully
wonderfully
before
him
there
as
she
had
been
on
that
first
day
when
she
had
had
tea
there
bending
forward
listening
her
dark
wondering
eyes
on
his
face
lizzie
at
the
sound
of
the
appeal
in
his
voice
had
felt
her
heart
expand
beat
so
that
her
body
seemed
to
hold
suddenly
some
great
possession
that
hurt
her
by
its
force
and
urgency
but
she
answered
almost
sharply
nonsense
breton
excuse
me
but
i
no
patience
with
that
kind
of
thing
people
are
meant
to
stand
alone
not
to
go
leaning
about
for
other
people
support
you
cursed
with
too
much
imagination
breton
and
you
remember
too
clearly
everything
that
happened
before
begin
now
as
though
you
were
born
yesterday
and
startle
the
family
by
your
energy
now
you
laughing
at
me
he
said
hotly
i
dare
say
i
deserve
it
but
i
do
feel
as
though
i
could
stand
very
much
of
it
from
anyone
then
he
was
astonished
by
the
sudden
softness
of
her
voice
no
no
please
she
said
i
understand
so
well
but
indeed
you
have
got
friends
who
believe
in
you
christopher
myself
if
you
count
me
and
lots
more
you
win
everyone
in
time
if
you
not
impatient
and
do
despair
do
think
of
your
grandmother
too
much
the
mere
fact
of
your
not
seeing
her
makes
you
imagine
her
as
something
portentous
and
dreadful
and
she
weighs
you
down
but
she
is
really
anything
at
all
she
ca
stop
one
energies
if
one
determined
to
let
them
go
please
please
do
think
i
laughing
i
only
want
to
help
i
know
you
do
he
answered
warmly
i
owe
you
more
than
i
can
say
all
these
last
weeks
you
and
christopher
have
been
the
two
people
held
the
world
together
for
me
but
there
more
than
you
know
miss
rand
there
he
bent
towards
her
she
knew
that
the
confidence
was
at
last
to
be
hers
it
needed
her
strongest
control
to
prevent
the
trembling
of
her
hands
his
eyes
were
alight
his
whole
body
eloquent
at
the
thought
of
what
he
might
be
about
to
tell
her
the
room
turned
before
her
voices
in
the
little
hall
then
the
door
opened
and
in
came
rand
and
daisy
they
had
been
to
the
play
nonsense
one
of
these
new
serious
plays
with
long
long
conversations
rand
wanted
tea
daisy
wanted
admiration
between
lizzie
and
breton
the
precious
cup
had
fallen
smashed
to
the
tiniest
atoms
meanwhile
aimless
conversation
was
more
than
he
in
his
present
mood
could
endure
he
made
some
excuse
and
scarcely
knowing
what
he
did
found
his
hat
and
coat
and
went
out
into
the
square
iii
there
had
come
to
him
one
of
those
agonies
of
loneliness
that
no
argument
no
reasoning
can
destroy
the
absence
of
any
letter
from
rachel
seemed
to
show
that
she
had
abandoned
him
in
all
this
vast
thickly
peopled
world
there
was
now
no
one
to
whom
his
presence
or
absence
his
fortunes
or
disasters
mattered
the
snowstorm
gathered
him
into
its
folds
the
snow
fell
against
his
mouth
his
eyes
and
before
him
behind
him
around
him
there
was
a
world
deserted
of
man
houses
blind
and
without
life
the
snow
might
fall
now
to
the
end
of
time
it
would
creep
up
and
up
falling
from
the
heavens
rising
from
the
earth
swallowing
all
creation
the
end
of
the
world
he
pressed
into
the
park
and
there
under
the
trees
stretching
like
gallows
against
the
throttling
sky
temptation
to
give
it
all
up
to
go
under
and
have
done
with
it
all
leapt
hot
and
fierce
upon
him
pont
and
the
others
were
waiting
for
him
they
would
be
good
to
him
the
upper
world
would
not
hear
nor
see
nor
think
of
his
disasters
and
slowly
with
the
others
life
would
recede
he
would
crumble
and
decay
and
cease
to
care
and
death
would
come
soon
enough
then
the
wind
smote
his
face
and
tore
at
his
coat
the
snow
died
away
beyond
the
black
bare
trees
a
very
faint
yellow
bar
threaded
the
thick
grey
promise
that
the
storm
was
at
an
end
suddenly
with
the
cessation
of
the
storm
the
long
field
of
white
seemed
good
and
restful
and
beyond
the
park
the
houses
showed
light
in
their
windows
the
yellow
spread
through
the
sky
and
stars
very
slowly
came
and
the
wind
died
away
courage
filled
him
rachel
might
never
come
or
write
or
care
but
he
would
make
the
thought
of
her
the
one
true
thing
in
his
heart
and
with
that
he
would
do
battle
so
long
as
he
could
christopher
and
miss
rand
he
thought
of
them
as
he
trudged
his
way
home
and
when
he
saw
the
white
silence
of
saxton
square
and
the
golden
sky
breaking
above
its
peace
and
quiet
he
thought
that
for
a
time
longer
he
would
keep
his
place
and
hold
his
own
chapter
ii
a
little
house
each
in
the
crypt
would
cry
one
freezes
here
and
why
a
heart
as
chill
my
own
would
thrill
back
to
life
and
its
fires
shall
we
live
or
die
the
rest
settle
robert
browning
i
rachel
at
seddon
court
watched
from
her
window
that
first
fallen
snow
seddon
court
is
about
three
miles
from
the
town
of
lewes
and
lies
tucked
and
cornered
under
the
very
brow
of
the
downs
it
is
a
grey
little
house
old
and
stalwart
with
a
courtyard
and
two
towers
the
towers
are
norman
the
rest
of
the
house
is
tudor
beyond
the
actual
building
there
are
gardens
that
run
to
the
very
foot
of
the
downs
with
only
a
patch
and
an
old
stone
wall
intervening
above
the
house
day
and
night
year
after
year
the
downs
are
bending
everything
beneath
their
steady
solemn
gaze
is
small
and
restless
as
the
colours
are
flung
by
the
sun
across
their
green
sprawling
limbs
the
house
at
their
feet
catches
their
reflected
smile
and
when
the
sun
is
gone
and
the
winds
blow
cowers
beneath
their
frown
everything
in
that
house
is
conscious
of
their
presence
rachel
had
been
at
seddon
court
for
a
month
and
now
at
the
window
of
her
looking
across
the
garden
up
into
their
dark
shadows
she
wondered
at
their
indifference
and
monotony
anyone
who
had
known
her
before
her
marriage
would
be
struck
instantly
on
seeing
her
now
by
a
change
in
her
her
whole
attitude
to
the
world
during
her
first
season
in
london
had
been
an
attitude
of
wonder
of
expectation
of
the
uncertainty
that
comes
from
expectation
with
that
expectation
were
also
alarm
distrust
and
it
was
only
when
some
sudden
incident
or
person
called
happiness
into
her
face
that
that
distrust
vanished
now
she
was
older
that
hesitation
and
awkwardness
were
gone
but
with
their
departure
had
vanished
too
much
of
her
honesty
her
dark
eyes
were
as
sincere
as
they
had
ever
been
but
to
anyone
who
had
known
her
before
her
attitude
now
was
assumed
nothing
might
catch
her
unprepared
but
what
experiences
were
they
that
had
taught
her
the
need
for
armour
sitting
in
her
room
looking
on
to
a
lawn
that
would
soon
be
white
and
to
downs
obscured
already
by
the
thick
tumbling
snow
she
knew
that
she
was
unhappy
disappointed
even
alarmed
suddenly
the
uneasiness
that
had
been
gathering
before
her
throughout
the
last
weeks
assumed
on
this
afternoon
the
definite
tangibility
of
a
challenge
what
the
matter
with
me
with
everything
what
happened
her
room
dark
green
and
white
had
no
pictures
but
a
long
low
with
grave
handsome
books
an
edition
of
someone
in
red
with
white
paper
labels
and
another
edition
of
someone
else
in
dark
blue
and
another
in
gold
and
brown
an
old
french
gilt
mirror
square
with
a
reflection
of
the
garden
and
the
foot
of
the
downs
in
it
an
old
queen
anne
rosewood
some
queen
anne
chairs
a
table
a
very
cool
quiet
room
at
her
feet
with
his
head
resting
on
her
shoe
there
lay
a
dog
this
dog
about
a
fortnight
ago
she
had
found
in
a
field
near
the
house
with
a
kettle
tied
on
to
his
tail
and
his
body
a
confused
catastrophe
of
mud
and
blood
she
had
carried
him
home
it
had
needed
some
courage
to
introduce
him
into
the
household
for
roddy
possessed
many
dogs
all
of
the
finest
breeds
and
this
was
a
mongrel
who
defied
description
he
was
very
short
and
shaggy
and
stumpy
he
was
much
too
large
for
a
yorkshire
terrier
and
yet
that
was
undoubtedly
his
derivation
there
was
something
of
a
in
him
and
something
of
a
skye
his
hair
fell
all
over
his
face
and
when
you
could
see
them
his
eyes
were
brown
his
nose
was
like
a
wet
blackberry
and
his
ears
were
long
and
full
of
emotion
when
he
ran
his
short
tail
on
which
the
hairs
were
arranged
like
branches
on
a
christmas
tree
stuck
up
into
the
air
and
he
resembled
a
rabbit
in
the
confusion
of
the
moment
rachel
had
called
him
jacob
because
she
thought
that
jacob
was
in
the
bible
the
hairy
one
after
all
you
not
call
a
dog
esau
yes
to
retain
him
had
needed
courage
thinking
of
roddy
attitude
to
the
dog
brought
so
many
other
attendant
thoughts
in
its
train
roddy
in
his
devotion
to
animals
and
oh
he
devoted
had
no
room
for
those
that
were
not
of
the
aristocracy
concerning
dogs
who
were
mongrels
he
was
kind
but
thought
them
much
better
dead
unkind
he
would
never
be
but
the
way
in
which
he
ignored
jacob
was
worse
than
any
unkindness
jacob
sensitive
perhaps
from
early
suffering
knew
this
and
avoided
roddy
ran
out
of
the
room
when
he
came
into
it
showed
in
every
way
that
he
must
not
expect
to
rank
with
the
other
dogs
very
characteristic
this
attitude
of
roddy
but
very
characteristic
too
the
affection
that
jacob
was
now
receiving
from
his
mistress
there
was
something
that
jacob
drew
from
rachel
that
none
of
the
fine
noble
dogs
of
the
house
was
able
to
secure
why
what
again
was
the
matter
why
was
rachel
unhappy
rachel
was
unhappy
and
the
answer
came
quite
clearly
to
her
as
the
room
was
darkened
by
the
great
storm
of
snow
now
falling
over
the
downs
and
the
garden
because
marriage
with
roddy
had
not
lessened
in
any
way
that
uneasy
disquiet
that
had
stirred
without
pause
beneath
her
life
before
her
marriage
that
uneasiness
had
indeed
during
the
last
three
months
increased
was
this
her
fault
or
roddy
attacked
now
by
a
scrutiny
that
refused
dismissal
she
delivered
herself
up
to
the
investigation
of
these
months
of
her
married
life
she
knew
that
she
had
only
once
been
happy
since
her
marriage
that
was
on
the
first
evening
when
the
noise
and
clamour
of
the
london
wedding
having
died
away
she
had
walked
with
roddy
in
the
peace
of
the
massiter
garden
lady
massiter
had
lent
her
house
for
the
first
weeks
of
the
honeymoon
had
felt
his
arm
about
her
had
believed
that
there
had
really
come
to
her
that
comfort
and
safety
for
which
she
longed
after
that
there
had
followed
a
fortnight
of
great
unreality
the
strangest
excitement
the
most
adventurous
wonders
but
a
wonder
and
excitement
that
were
from
herself
the
real
rachel
beaminster
most
absolutely
removed
it
was
as
though
she
had
watched
closely
but
detached
the
experiences
of
some
other
girl
roddy
had
during
those
times
been
a
most
ardent
and
passionate
lover
she
had
tried
to
respond
and
had
hidden
as
best
she
could
her
failure
then
suddenly
with
the
time
of
their
going
abroad
passion
had
left
him
it
had
left
him
as
swiftly
as
the
passing
of
wind
over
a
hill
it
was
there
it
was
gone
but
he
remained
the
perfect
husband
his
kindness
his
charm
his
simplicity
his
affection
for
her
an
affection
that
could
never
for
an
instant
be
doubted
these
things
had
delighted
her
he
was
now
the
friend
the
strong
reliant
companion
that
she
had
wanted
him
to
be
during
those
first
weeks
in
italy
and
greece
happiness
might
have
come
to
her
had
she
not
been
stirred
by
her
remembrance
of
the
earlier
weeks
the
passion
that
had
been
in
him
although
it
had
not
touched
her
now
in
retrospect
lit
fires
for
her
imagination
instantly
back
to
her
had
come
the
whole
disquiet
and
unrest
the
things
that
roddy
called
from
her
now
she
suddenly
discovered
with
a
great
shrinking
alarm
were
all
the
beaminster
things
all
the
true
emotions
qualities
traditions
that
made
up
her
secret
life
were
roused
in
her
by
their
own
inherent
vitality
never
by
his
evocation
of
them
was
beaminster
roddy
was
beaminster
with
his
kindness
and
courtesy
his
eyes
saw
the
world
with
the
eyes
of
his
ancestors
his
tongue
spoke
the
language
that
had
in
it
no
sincerity
his
heart
wished
for
all
the
ceremonies
and
lies
that
the
beaminster
had
believed
in
since
the
beginning
of
time
but
her
discovery
did
not
lead
her
much
further
she
had
in
her
heart
of
hearts
always
known
that
roddy
was
a
beaminster
why
then
had
she
married
him
she
had
married
him
because
she
had
been
untrue
to
herself
because
she
had
herself
encouraged
the
beaminster
blood
in
her
to
blind
her
eyes
because
she
had
desired
deceit
rather
than
truth
because
she
had
wanted
the
comfort
that
the
man
could
give
her
rather
than
the
man
himself
because
she
had
muffled
and
stifled
and
silenced
that
power
in
her
the
power
that
made
her
restless
and
unquiet
the
power
that
was
as
hostile
to
the
beaminster
faith
as
heaven
is
to
hell
and
yet
this
vehemence
of
explanation
did
not
altogether
explain
roddy
roddy
was
not
a
beaminster
like
uncle
john
or
uncle
richard
or
aunt
adela
there
was
an
elemental
direct
emotion
in
roddy
that
was
exactly
opposed
to
beaminster
conventionality
these
two
elements
in
him
puzzled
and
even
frightened
her
his
attitude
during
that
first
fortnight
of
their
marriage
she
saw
again
and
again
in
lesser
degrees
during
their
time
abroad
she
had
seen
him
so
primitive
in
his
joy
and
excitement
over
places
and
people
and
moments
colour
food
storms
towns
anything
that
she
had
been
astounded
by
the
force
of
it
emotions
swept
over
him
and
were
gone
but
whilst
they
were
there
she
knew
that
she
counted
to
him
for
nothing
strangest
of
ironies
that
when
he
was
least
a
beaminster
then
was
she
farthest
from
him
strangest
of
ironies
that
her
link
with
him
should
be
the
beaminster
in
him
she
was
frightened
of
his
primitive
passions
she
had
in
her
the
instinct
that
one
day
they
would
touch
his
relationship
to
her
and
that
that
contact
would
rouse
in
her
the
full
tide
of
the
unhappiness
of
which
she
was
now
so
conscious
and
that
then
what
might
not
happen
and
yet
behind
it
all
she
felt
a
strange
almost
pathetic
satisfaction
because
he
after
all
had
in
him
just
as
she
had
his
two
natures
at
war
there
at
least
they
found
some
common
link
her
eagerness
to
find
some
link
was
evidence
enough
of
the
affection
she
had
for
him
after
their
return
to
england
the
wilder
nature
in
him
had
extended
and
broadened
everything
to
do
with
seddon
court
drew
it
out
of
him
his
passion
for
the
place
was
wonderful
to
witness
every
stone
of
the
little
grey
building
was
a
jewel
in
his
eyes
the
servants
the
cattle
the
horses
the
dogs
the
flowers
the
villagers
even
the
townspeople
of
lewes
drew
sentiment
from
him
my
old
place
he
would
say
cuddling
it
to
himself
he
was
never
sloppy
about
it
but
direct
and
simple
and
straightforward
it
was
obviously
great
emotion
above
all
other
emotions
he
was
most
anxious
that
rachel
should
share
this
with
him
and
during
her
first
weeks
there
she
thought
that
she
would
do
so
then
the
disquiet
in
her
spread
to
the
place
the
house
spread
itself
out
before
her
now
as
the
lure
that
had
from
the
beginning
tempted
her
it
was
for
this
place
and
quiet
that
you
were
false
to
yourself
roddy
felt
that
she
did
not
share
his
enthusiasm
and
their
difficulty
over
this
was
exactly
their
difficulty
over
everything
else
simply
that
roddy
was
the
least
eloquent
person
in
the
world
he
could
explain
nothing
whatever
of
the
vague
unhappiness
or
dissatisfaction
at
his
heart
rachel
have
explained
a
great
many
things
but
roddy
she
felt
would
only
look
at
her
in
his
kind
puzzled
way
and
wonder
why
she
could
take
things
as
they
were
perhaps
during
these
last
weeks
he
had
himself
felt
that
all
was
not
well
rachel
thought
that
sometimes
now
through
all
his
kindness
she
detected
a
floating
wistful
speculation
on
his
part
as
to
whether
she
were
happy
he
her
to
be
happy
most
tremendously
he
wanted
it
and
did
she
explain
to
him
that
she
was
not
happy
because
she
was
now
for
ever
attended
by
a
sense
of
her
own
disloyalty
to
all
that
was
best
in
her
he
would
have
suggested
a
doctor
or
have
made
her
a
present
had
she
been
some
stranger
and
had
the
case
been
presented
to
him
he
would
have
probably
dismissed
it
by
saying
that
having
made
her
bed
she
must
lie
on
it
after
all
she
married
the
feller
well
then
so
perhaps
if
this
had
been
simply
her
trouble
she
would
have
done
her
bravest
best
to
endeavour
but
there
was
more
behind
it
all
far
far
more
she
saw
her
marriage
to
roddy
her
struggling
for
her
present
morbid
introspection
as
a
stage
in
what
was
now
developing
into
a
duel
between
herself
and
her
grandmother
her
grandmother
had
planned
this
marriage
her
grandmother
was
determined
to
destroy
the
honesty
and
truth
in
her
and
had
chosen
a
beaminster
for
her
agent
and
now
waited
happy
for
the
death
of
soul
but
rachel
soul
should
not
so
readily
die
during
all
these
weeks
the
thought
of
her
grandmother
had
been
continually
with
her
how
she
hated
her
and
with
what
fervour
did
rachel
return
that
hatred
there
was
no
melodrama
in
this
hatred
when
she
had
been
a
very
little
girl
rachel
had
somehow
believed
that
her
grandmother
had
been
very
cruel
to
her
mother
and
father
she
had
hated
her
for
that
then
she
had
seen
that
her
grandmother
disliked
her
and
wished
to
tease
her
so
she
had
hated
her
for
that
also
her
older
amplification
of
this
into
principles
and
instincts
had
not
altered
the
original
vehemence
of
the
passion
it
had
only
given
it
reasons
for
its
existence
and
so
thinking
of
her
grandmother
she
thought
also
of
francis
breton
some
weeks
ago
she
had
received
a
letter
from
him
and
that
letter
was
now
lying
in
the
desk
of
her
she
had
thought
that
her
marriage
would
have
snapped
her
interest
in
her
cousin
because
it
would
have
broken
that
hostility
with
her
grandmother
upon
which
her
relationship
with
her
cousin
so
largely
depended
but
now
when
she
saw
that
marriage
had
only
intensified
her
hostility
to
the
duchess
so
therefore
it
had
intensified
her
perception
of
breton
his
letter
had
aroused
in
her
just
as
contact
with
him
aroused
in
her
everything
in
her
that
now
for
her
own
peace
of
mind
she
should
keep
at
bay
his
letter
had
amounted
to
this
you
are
a
rebel
as
i
am
a
rebel
we
have
said
very
little
but
you
have
recognized
in
me
the
things
that
i
have
recognized
in
you
you
have
escaped
through
marriage
but
for
me
there
is
no
escape
and
if
you
would
for
the
sake
of
those
things
that
we
have
in
common
keep
me
from
going
utterly
under
then
you
must
help
me
as
only
you
can
he
did
not
say
this
nor
anything
at
all
like
this
he
only
very
quietly
congratulated
her
on
her
marriage
hoped
that
she
would
be
very
happy
said
that
london
was
a
little
desolate
and
difficult
hoped
that
she
would
not
think
more
harshly
of
him
than
she
could
help
and
at
the
very
end
told
her
that
meeting
her
made
him
feel
that
he
was
not
entirely
abandoned
by
everybody
it
was
the
letter
of
a
weak
man
and
she
knew
it
but
it
was
the
letter
of
a
man
who
was
weak
exactly
in
the
places
where
she
also
failed
and
this
more
than
anything
else
moved
her
they
two
alone
it
seemed
were
struggling
to
keep
their
feet
in
a
world
that
did
not
need
them
it
had
been
through
these
months
sharpest
unhappiness
the
consciousness
that
roddy
and
indeed
everything
at
seddon
court
could
get
on
so
very
well
without
her
nobody
in
london
needed
her
nobody
here
needed
her
if
you
accepted
the
beaminster
doctrine
then
no
wife
would
demand
more
from
a
husband
than
roddy
gave
rachel
but
was
this
not
simply
another
proof
that
rachel
had
made
a
beaminster
marriage
rachel
had
been
flung
straight
from
the
schoolroom
into
marriage
and
the
sensitive
agonizing
cry
of
a
child
to
be
loved
by
somebody
the
cry
that
had
always
been
so
urgent
in
her
was
urgent
still
it
was
exactly
this
comfortable
sense
of
being
a
help
that
roddy
had
not
given
her
now
this
letter
gave
it
to
her
but
if
this
letter
was
an
appeal
just
as
the
mongrel
jacob
now
at
her
feet
was
an
appeal
on
the
part
of
someone
wounded
and
outcast
to
her
pity
so
also
was
it
an
invitation
to
rebellion
it
was
also
a
temptation
to
deceit
and
did
she
answer
the
letter
she
encouraged
breton
to
write
again
she
opened
up
not
only
a
new
relationship
to
him
but
also
a
new
relationship
to
all
the
forces
that
were
most
hostile
to
roddy
and
her
married
happiness
may
eversley
had
once
said
to
her
sit
down
and
see
without
any
exaggeration
or
false
colouring
what
you
got
take
away
ruthlessly
anything
that
you
imagine
that
you
got
but
have
take
away
ruthlessly
everything
that
you
imagine
that
you
would
like
to
have
but
are
not
confident
of
securing
see
what
happened
to
you
in
the
past
take
away
ruthlessly
any
sentimental
repentances
or
sloppy
regrets
but
learn
quite
resolutely
from
your
ugly
mistakes
long
ago
she
had
written
this
down
now
was
the
first
necessity
for
applying
it
the
doctrine
of
truth
truth
to
oneself
the
one
thing
that
mattered
she
knew
that
the
pursuit
of
truth
was
to
her
and
to
every
rebel
against
the
beaminsters
the
restive
tiger
in
marrying
roddy
she
had
been
untrue
to
herself
in
writing
to
breton
she
would
be
true
to
herself
but
untrue
to
roddy
she
was
fond
of
roddy
although
she
did
not
love
him
nor
did
he
really
love
her
the
anxiety
on
both
their
parts
to
avoid
hurting
one
another
was
proof
enough
of
that
she
thought
there
then
was
the
whole
situation
as
she
felt
jacob
warm
head
against
her
foot
a
great
agitation
of
loneliness
and
dismay
and
helplessness
swept
over
her
tears
were
in
her
throat
and
eyes
then
with
a
strong
disdain
she
pushed
it
all
from
her
she
was
growing
morbid
losing
her
sense
of
humour
and
proportion
here
in
the
house
there
was
nita
raseley
staying
in
the
country
there
were
people
to
be
called
upon
to
be
invited
to
be
interested
in
there
was
roddy
a
perfect
husband
she
strangled
that
other
rachel
there
in
her
room
now
you
dead
she
felt
and
seemed
to
fling
a
lifeless
crumpled
figure
out
into
the
snow
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
you
not
rachel
beaminster
now
you
rachel
seddon
act
accordingly
and
do
whine
she
washed
her
face
and
brushed
her
hair
and
combed
jacob
hair
out
of
his
eyes
and
then
determined
to
be
sensible
and
cheerful
and
civilized
went
down
to
tea
ii
the
room
called
the
library
was
the
pleasantest
room
in
the
house
an
old
long
room
with
windows
that
stretched
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
a
large
stone
open
fireplace
and
running
from
end
to
end
and
old
sporting
prints
above
them
before
the
great
fireplace
the
tea
was
waiting
and
there
also
was
nita
raseley
very
charming
and
fresh
and
pink
in
the
face
and
golden
in
the
hair
it
was
strange
that
nita
raseley
should
have
been
their
first
guest
since
their
marriage
because
rachel
most
certainly
did
not
like
her
but
after
that
meeting
at
the
massiters
the
girl
had
flung
a
passionate
and
incoherent
correspondence
upon
rachel
and
had
ended
by
practically
inviting
herself
roddy
liked
her
rachel
knew
that
so
perhaps
after
all
it
had
been
a
good
thing
to
have
her
there
rachel
dislike
of
her
was
founded
on
a
complete
distrust
she
all
wrong
and
insincere
and
beastly
never
have
her
here
again
and
yet
really
miss
raseley
had
behaved
herself
had
been
most
quiet
and
decorous
and
affectionate
the
electric
light
was
delicately
shaded
the
curtains
were
drawn
outside
was
the
storm
here
cosiness
and
shining
comfort
oh
rachel
i
so
glad
you
come
i
do
so
want
tea
where
roddy
just
come
in
he
be
here
in
a
minute
rachel
came
over
to
the
fire
and
was
busy
over
the
well
nita
what
have
you
been
at
all
the
afternoon
oh
that
silly
old
book
rachel
how
you
tell
me

my
dear
rachel
why

go
on
for
pages

and
nothing
happens
and
i
sure
it
most
unwholesome

so
unhappy
and
always
hating
one
another
i
like
books

be
cheerful
and

people
one

good
thing

the
same
things

it
sugar
yes
dear
you
know
lots
darling
have
you
got
a
headache
you
look
rotten
you
really
rachel
knew
that
she
must
keep
an
especial
guard
she
was
irritable
out
of
sorts
she
would
have
liked
immensely
to
send
nita
to
have
her
tea
in
the
nursery
were
there
one
no
i
all
right
but
i
wanted
to
get
out
and
this
storm
stopped
me
you
do
look
dicky
oh
what
do
you
think
roddy
taking
us
over
to
hawes
to
lunch
if
the
weather

a
wire
but
ca
he
knows
i
got
miss
crale
coming
here
only
old
miss

put
her
off
i
ca
possibly
i
put
her
off
once
before
she
wants
to
talk
about
her
soldiers
institute
place
then
rachel
added
more
slowly
but
roddy
knew
oh
he
said
you
got
some
silly
old
engagement
but
he
put
it
off
he
knows
i
ca
he
was
talking
about
it
this
morning
he
knew
how
then
she
stopped
she
was
not
going
to
show
nita
raseley
that
she
minded
anything
but
roddy
had
always
said
that
they
would
go
over
together
to
hawes
one
of
the
loveliest
old
places
in
the
world
he
had
always
promised
she
knew
perfectly
well
what
had
occurred
nita
had
caught
roddy
and
clung
on
to
him
and
persuaded
him
roddy
was
such
a
boy
but
she
was
hurt
and
she
despised
herself
for
it
oh
she
said
laughing
that
all
right
you
two
must
just
go
over
together
that
all
i
go
another
time
well
you
see
roddy
send
a
wire
and
the
rockingtons
would
being
put
off
at
the
last
moment
oh
you
beastly
dog
he
been
licking
my
shoe
rachel
really
he
ought
to
ought
he
so
funny
of
you
rachel
when
he
a
mongrel
and
roddy
got
such
lovely
darlings
of
course
jacob
a
dear
but
he
rather
absurd
to
look
at
jacob
glanced
at
her
shook
his
ears
and
then
hearing
a
step
that
he
knew
retired
instantly
under
a
sofa
in
a
far
corner
of
the
room
roddy
came
in
and
stood
for
a
moment
laughing
across
at
them
he
was
in
an
old
tweed
suit
with
a
soft
collar
and
his
face
was
looking
at
him
as
he
stood
there
the
absolute
type
of
health
and
strength
and
cleanly
vigour
rachel
wondered
why
she
felt
irritable
she
certainly
was
out
of
sorts
hullo
you
two
roddy
said
you
do
look
cosy
talkin
secrets
or
will
you
put
up
with
a
man
oh
said
nita
raseley
why
of
rachel
only
just
come
down
has
been
any
time
for
secrets
come
and
get
warm
room
was
made
for
him
rachel
smiled
at
him
as
she
gave
him
his
tea
well
roddy
what
have
been
doing
i
been
trying
to
write
letters
and
nita
been
abusing
a
novel
i
lent
her
i
hope
you
been
better
employed
i
been
botherin
around
with
nugent
over
those
two
horses
he
bought
last
week
and
oh
i
say
rachel
you
come
over
to
hawes
wo
you
you
know
i
ca
i
got
miss
crale
coming
to
luncheon
oh
i
say
put
her
off
ca
i
put
her
off
before
and
she
does
deserve
to
be
badly
treated
oh
dash
it
but
i
gone
and
wired
the
rockingtons
wo
like
my
changin
well
do
change
you
and
nita
go
over
no
but
you
know
we
always
arranged
to
go
over
together
you
see
i
felt
sure
you
put
old
miss
crale
on
to
another
day
mind
no
roddy
thank
you
that
not
fair
on
her
it
ca
be
helped
you
go
over
with
nita
then
there
occurred
between
them
one
of
those
little
situations
that
were
now
so
frequent
rachel
was
hurt
but
was
determined
to
show
nothing
roddy
knew
that
she
was
hurt
but
was
quite
unable
to
improve
relations
partly
because
he
had
no
words
partly
because
a
feller
looks
such
a
fool
tryin
to
explain
partly
because
there
was
in
him
a
quality
of
sullen
obstinacy
that
was
mingled
most
strangely
with
his
kindness
and
sentiment
he
was
absolutely
ready
to
fling
nita
and
the
rockingtons
into
limbo
but
he
was
quite
unable
to
set
about
such
a
business
moreover
now
there
was
nita
raseley
it
was
at
this
moment
that
jacob
having
fought
in
the
dark
recesses
of
the
sofa
between
his
dislike
of
roddy
and
his
love
of
tea
declared
for
his
stomach
and
walked
slowly
and
with
the
dignity
required
by
the
presence
of
an
enemy
across
the
room
hullo
there
the
mongrel
roddy
endeavoured
to
cover
earlier
awkwardness
by
easy
laughter
but
the
laughter
was
not
easy
and
his
attempt
to
pat
jacob
was
frustrated
by
a
sidling
movement
on
the
part
then
nita
raseley
laughed
roddy
now
thought
that
women
were
damnable
that
his
wife
had
no
right
to
drag
a
mongrel
like
that
about
with
her
that
he
show
them
if
they
laughed
at
him
and
that
if
rachel
could
come
why
then
she
must
just
lump
it
the
last
thought
of
all
was
that
rachel
was
always
finding
a
grievance
in
something
he
waited
a
little
while
talked
in
a
stiff
and
unnatural
fashion
and
then
went
this
weather
very
trying
dear
is
it
said
nita
if
i
were
you
i
really
would
go
and
lie
down
you
do
look
seedy
i
think
i
will
said
rachel
as
she
went
slowly
upstairs
to
her
room
she
knew
that
she
would
answer
francis
breton
letter
chapter
iii
first
sequel

he
began
to
love
her
so
soon
as
he
perceived
that
she
was
passing
out
of
his
control
jane
austen
i
next
morning
rachel
wrote
the
following
letter
to
francis
breton
dear
breton
it
was
good
of
you
to
write
to
me
and
i
must
apologize
for
allowing
your
letter
to
remain
so
long
unanswered
but
on
my
return
from
abroad
there
were
naturally
a
great
many
things
to
do
and
a
great
many
people
to
see
my
husband
and
i
enjoyed
our
time
abroad
immensely
it
was
my
first
visit
to
greece
and
italy
and
i
loved
every
bit
of
it
athens
is
to
me
more
wonderful
than
now
here
so
snugly
in
england
seems
possible
florence
and
rome
very
beautiful
of
course
but
spoilt
do
you
think
by
tourists
and
the
modern
italian
who
has
learnt
american
habits
how
is
london
i
not
yet
had
a
good
look
at
it
since
i
came
back
but
we
shall
be
coming
up
soon
i
expect
and
have
taken
a
flat
in
elliston
square
between
portland
place
and
byranston
square
your
letter
sounds
a
little
dismal
it
is
kind
of
you
to
say
that
i
can
help
you
but
indeed
if
writing
to
me
helps
do
so
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
at
present
my
husband
shares
the
family
point
of
view
and
so
long
as
that
is
so
i
can
not
ask
you
to
come
and
see
me
but
i
hope
that
soon
he
will
see
the
whole
affair
more
sensibly
yours
very
sincerely
rachel
seddon
she
was
not
proud
of
this
letter
when
she
read
it
she
whose
impulse
was
for
truth
seemed
to
be
flung
at
every
turn
into
direct
dishonesty
no
she
would
not
seize
on
the
excuse
of
some
vague
tyrannical
fate
she
was
herself
her
own
agent
in
this
affair
and
she
bitterly
from
her
heart
condemned
herself
and
yet
strangely
this
letter
to
breton
seemed
in
obedience
to
some
inward
impulse
her
most
honest
action
since
her
marriage
yet
why
did
she
not
go
to
roddy
now
and
say
to
him
that
she
had
written
to
breton
and
was
determined
to
act
as
his
friend
roddy
would
forbid
any
further
relationship
she
knew
that
and
then
no
she
could
not
see
beyond
she
banished
the
letter
from
her
mind
saw
the
two
of
them
off
to
hawes
and
entertained
miss
crale
to
luncheon
miss
crale
was
a
broad
and
shapeless
old
maid
with
huge
boots
a
bass
voice
and
a
moustache
she
was
behind
most
of
the
charitable
affairs
in
the
county
was
popular
everywhere
and
the
most
energetic
character
rachel
had
ever
met
rachel
liked
her
and
she
liked
rachel
and
after
she
had
departed
breathless
and
on
some
further
visit
concerned
with
some
further
charity
rachel
felt
braced
and
invigorated
and
happier
than
she
had
been
for
many
weeks
it
was
a
day
of
frosted
blue
and
the
sun
flashed
fire
on
to
the
great
field
of
snow
that
stretched
from
sky
to
sky
the
downs
lay
humped
against
the
blue
and
the
whole
world
was
frozen
into
silence
the
only
sounds
were
the
soft
stir
the
snow
falling
from
branches
or
walls
made
and
the
sharp
cries
of
some
children
playing
in
a
field
near
at
hand
when
miss
crale
had
gone
rachel
went
off
for
a
walk
jacob
was
with
her
she
struck
up
the
winding
path
on
to
the
downs
the
snow
was
hard
and
yielded
a
pleasant
friendly
crunch
beneath
her
feet
shadows
that
were
dark
and
yet
were
filled
with
colour
lay
across
the
snow
beneath
her
a
white
valley
against
which
trees
and
buildings
seemed
little
wooden
toys
and
in
the
far
distance
hills
rising
cut
with
their
iridescent
glow
the
blue
sky
no
clouds
no
movement
no
sound
and
soon
the
sun
would
be
golden
and
then
hard
and
red
and
then
across
all
the
snow
pink
shadows
would
creep
and
the
evening
stars
would
burn
in
the
heart
of
the
snow
a
valley
between
the
shoulders
of
the
downs
a
black
clump
of
trees
clustered
she
could
see
now
seddon
court
like
a
grey
box
at
her
feet
very
tiny
and
breathing
rest
and
peace
some
of
her
trouble
slipped
from
her
under
this
clear
sky
and
in
this
sharp
air
from
these
quiet
hills
she
saw
all
her
introspection
as
an
evil
thing
morbid
cowardly
from
here
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
trouble
with
roddy
had
been
because
he
did
not
know
what
introspection
meant
and
could
not
understand
the
appeals
that
she
made
to
him
but
was
it
not
unfair
that
men
should
have
so
many
things
that
could
take
the
place
of
love
for
roddy
there
were
a
thousand
emotions
to
give
meaning
to
life
for
rachel
all
experience
seemed
to
come
to
her
only
through
people
and
her
relations
with
people
soon
the
valley
and
the
little
toy
houses
were
behind
her
and
she
had
only
the
white
rise
and
fall
of
the
hill
on
every
side
dropped
into
a
hollow
was
a
little
dark
deserted
house
with
bare
trees
about
it
otherwise
there
was
no
to
be
seen
this
absence
of
human
life
suddenly
drew
up
before
her
as
sharply
and
with
as
living
an
actuality
as
though
some
mirage
had
cast
it
there
london
three
months
in
the
country
had
flung
the
london
that
she
knew
into
a
vivid
perspective
that
was
quite
novel
to
her
by
the
london
that
she
knew
she
did
not
mean
the
london
of
parties
and
theatre
the
london
of
nita
and
her
kind
but
rather
the
actual
london
of
the
streets
and
squares
and
fountain
and
parks
and
dusty
plane
trees
and
tinkling
she
felt
now
quite
a
thrill
of
excitement
to
think
that
in
another
week
or
two
she
would
be
back
in
it
all
and
would
see
all
the
lamps
coming
out
and
the
jingling
cabs
and
the
heavy
lumbering
omnibuses
and
that
she
would
hear
again
the
sharp
crying
of
the
newspaper
boys
and
the
ringing
of
church
bells
and
the
thud
of
the
horses
down
the
row
and
the
hum
of
voices
above
the
orchestra
during
the
intervals
of
some
play
she
thought
of
portland
place
and
the
park
and
the
round
church
and
the
little
shops
and
oxford
circus
and
the
buses
tumbling
down
regent
street
into
piccadilly
and
then
tumbling
down
again
into
pall
mall
from
portland
place
she
seemed
to
look
down
over
the
whole
of
london
and
to
see
it
like
a
jewel
with
its
glow
dazzling
the
night
sky
she
knew
now
that
although
she
hated
her
grandmother
she
did
not
hate
the
portland
place
house
and
she
was
glad
that
roddy
had
taken
a
flat
near
there
no
other
part
of
london
would
ever
be
quite
the
same
to
her
as
that
was
it
would
always
be
home
to
her
more
than
any
other
place
in
the
world
with
its
space
and
air
and
sense
of
life
crowding
around
it
and
as
she
walked
she
was
fired
with
the
desire
to
have
some
real
active
share
in
the
london
life
not
in
the
sham
life
of
pleasure
and
entertainment
but
to
be
working
as
all
kinds
of
men
must
be
working
with
london
behind
them
influencing
them
sometimes
depressing
them
sometimes
exalting
them
always
moving
within
them
that
was
a
fine
ambition
to
work
towards
a
greater
london
a
greater
finer
truer
world
and
whether
you
were
politician
or
artist
or
journalist
or
merchant
or
novelist
or
clerk
or
philanthropist
still
by
your
working
honestly
you
would
deserve
your
place
in
that
company
if
she
could
have
some
share
in
such
things
then
her
miserable
doubts
and
forebodings
would
vanish
in
a
vision
too
bright
and
glorious
to
contain
them
as
she
walked
her
face
glowed
and
her
body
moved
as
though
it
could
continue
thus
swinging
through
the
clear
air
for
all
time
she
determined
that
on
this
very
evening
she
would
tell
roddy
about
breton
whatever
might
be
the
result
life
in
the
future
should
be
clear
of
beaminster
confusions
she
would
even
ask
roddy
to
help
her
about
breton
to
influence
perhaps
her
grandmother
with
regard
to
him
then
in
a
few
days
nita
raseley
would
be
gone
and
afterwards
she
would
discipline
all
her
wit
and
energy
towards
establishing
a
fine
relationship
with
roddy
something
had
throughout
all
these
months
been
wrong
she
would
discover
where
that
wrong
lay
she
would
curb
her
own
impatience
would
fling
herself
into
his
interests
would
learn
the
things
that
roddy
wanted
from
her
and
give
them
to
him
then
as
the
sun
sank
lower
and
the
yellow
shadows
crept
up
the
sky
she
felt
desolate
and
lonely
vigour
left
her
she
had
descended
now
into
the
valley
and
had
come
to
the
deserted
house
with
the
stark
frowning
trees
this
place
she
had
heard
had
in
the
eighteenth
century
been
a
private
and
now
behind
its
darkened
windows
she
could
have
fancied
shapes
and
down
the
wind
the
echo
of
voices
she
fought
with
all
her
might
against
a
great
tide
of
loneliness
that
was
now
sweeping
up
about
her
there
had
always
been
so
many
people
around
her
and
yet
she
had
always
been
lonely
even
may
and
christopher
had
not
helped
her
there
she
had
a
sense
now
of
all
the
people
in
all
the
world
who
were
waiting
for
the
other
people
who
could
understand
them
they
were
always
missing
one
another
so
near
sometimes
sometimes
touching
and
then
after
all
going
through
life
alone
those
were
the
people
with
feelings
and
emotions
and
as
for
the
people
without
them
of
what
use
was
life
to
either
way
except
for
the
fortunate
way
life
was
a
futile
business
then
climbing
up
from
that
sinister
little
valley
and
seeing
that
the
sky
had
turned
to
violet
and
that
the
evening
star
was
there
burning
as
she
had
known
that
it
would
she
laughed
at
her
morbidity
she
shook
herself
free
from
it
thought
once
more
of
the
things
that
she
would
do
with
roddy
thought
of
london
and
the
fun
that
she
would
have
there
thought
of
christopher
and
uncle
john
and
even
aunt
adela
then
as
she
turned
down
the
little
crooked
path
towards
the
house
she
thought
again
of
her
cousin
she
would
work
without
ceasing
to
bring
him
back
into
the
family
that
at
any
rate
was
work
upon
which
she
might
commence
on
her
return
to
london
and
as
she
clicked
the
little
a
to
the
garden
behind
her
she
was
almost
happy
again
the
dusk
was
deepening
into
darkness
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
above
the
hill
she
had
entered
the
garden
on
the
further
side
of
the
house
and
passed
through
a
long
laurel
path
her
feet
silenced
by
the
snow
jacob
had
stayed
some
way
behind
she
could
see
the
white
lawn
and
beyond
it
the
lighted
house
she
was
about
to
step
out
of
the
dark
shadow
of
the
laurels
when
she
found
just
in
front
of
her
almost
touching
her
hidden
by
the
black
depth
of
the
trees
two
figures
she
was
upon
them
with
a
startled
cry
a
man
had
his
arms
about
a
woman
bending
back
a
little
he
had
pulled
her
forward
against
him
and
was
kissing
her
so
fiercely
that
her
hands
were
buried
deep
in
his
coat
to
steady
herself
rachel
knew
them
instantly
they
were
her
husband
and
nita
raseley
she
stepped
past
them
on
to
the
lawn
and
at
that
instant
they
were
conscious
of
her
then
she
walked
swiftly
into
the
house
ii
she
went
up
to
her
bedroom
no
thought
came
to
her
her
mind
was
blank
but
she
noticed
little
things
put
some
of
the
silver
things
on
her
in
order
pulled
her
blind
a
little
lower
moved
to
the
fire
and
pushed
the
logs
into
a
blaze
she
sat
there
for
a
long
long
time
when
the
echoed
through
the
rooms
she
was
still
sitting
there
thinking
nothing
her
maid
came
to
her
she
told
her
the
dress
that
she
would
wear
and
after
a
while
sat
staring
into
her
mirror
whilst
her
hair
was
brushed
lucy
said
the
snow
begun
again
my
lady
coming
down
fast
then
some
absence
of
light
in
her
mistress
eyes
frightened
her
and
she
said
no
more
someone
knocked
on
the
door
a
note
for
her
ladyship
rachel
read
it
it
was
all
a
horrible
mistake
darling
rachel
you
it
was
only
fun
just
nothing
at
all
shall
i
come
and
explain
if
you
rather
not
see
me
just
now
say
so
and
i
shall
understand
i
been
so
upset
that
i
think
i
come
down
to
dinner
if
it
is
much
bother
having
just
a
little
sent
up
to
me
it
was
all
a
silly
mistake
as
you
see
when
we
explained
your
loving
nita
when
she
came
to
we
rachel
coloured
a
little
then
she
said
lucy
bring
me
the
local
in
my
lucy
brought
it
to
her
then
she
wrote
dear
nita
no
explanations
necessary
there
is
a
good
train
up
to
town
from
hawes
at
morning
yours
rachel
seddon
i
want
this
taken
to
miss
raseley
lucy
now
she
not
very
well
so
ask
haddon
to
see
that
dinner
is
sent
up
to
her
room
please
then
she
finished
dressing
and
went
down
to
roddy
iii
he
had
perhaps
expected
that
she
would
not
come
down
but
there
was
no
opportunity
given
them
for
speech
because
the
butler
announcing
dinner
followed
her
into
the
library
they
went
in
he
sat
opposite
her
looking
ashamed
with
his
eyes
lowered
and
the
red
coming
and
going
in
his
sunburned
cheeks
they
talked
for
the
sake
of
the
servants
and
she
asked
him
whether
hawes
had
been
as
lovely
as
ever
and
whether
lady
rockington
nerves
were
better
and
how
their
youngest
boy
delicate
from
his
birth
was
now
whilst
she
spoke
her
brain
was
turning
turning
like
a
wheel
could
she
only
for
five
minutes
think
clearly
then
might
much
after
disaster
be
avoided
she
knew
that
in
the
conversation
that
was
to
come
roddy
would
follow
her
lead
and
that
it
would
be
she
who
would
be
responsible
for
all
consequences
she
knew
that
and
yet
she
could
not
force
her
brain
to
be
clear
nor
foresee
what
the
end
of
it
all
was
to
be
the
dessert
and
the
wine
came
at
last
and
she
went
i
be
in
the
library
roddy
she
said
he
gave
her
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
in
that
pause
with
the
house
quite
silent
all
about
her
and
the
fire
crackling
and
the
lights
softly
shining
she
strove
to
discipline
her
mind
she
had
known
as
soon
as
she
had
seen
them
there
that
the
most
awful
element
in
it
was
that
this
had
in
no
way
altered
the
earlier
case
it
merely
precipitated
a
crisis
and
demanded
a
definition
nothing
could
have
proved
to
her
that
she
had
never
loved
roddy
so
much
as
her
own
feeling
at
this
crisis
towards
him
therein
lay
her
own
sin
it
was
simply
now
of
the
future
that
she
must
think
the
awful
chasm
that
might
divide
them
after
this
night
were
not
their
words
most
carefully
ordered
shook
her
with
fear
peril
to
herself
for
she
could
stand
aside
and
see
herself
quite
clearly
and
she
knew
that
if
she
and
he
were
to
say
things
that
they
could
neither
of
them
afterwards
forget
then
for
herself
and
from
her
deep
need
of
love
and
affection
there
was
temptation
awaiting
her
that
no
disguise
could
cover
then
as
more
clearly
she
figured
the
scene
in
the
garden
patience
seemed
difficult
to
command
she
hated
nita
raseley
that
was
no
matter
but
she
despised
roddy
and
were
he
once
to
see
that
contempt
she
knew
that
his
after
remembrance
of
it
would
divide
them
more
completely
than
anything
else
could
do
when
he
came
in
she
had
still
no
clearer
idea
of
what
she
intended
to
say
or
how
she
wished
things
to
go
she
was
sitting
in
an
by
the
fire
with
her
hands
shielding
her
face
and
he
sat
down
opposite
her
and
stared
at
her
and
cleared
his
throat
and
wished
that
she
would
take
her
hands
down
and
then
finally
plunged
rachel
i
do
know
i
ca
hang
it
all
what
i
say
i
been
a
beastly
cad
and
i
cut
my
right
hand
off
to
have
prevented
it
happening
she
took
her
hand
down
and
turned
towards
him
let
cut
all
the
recrimination
part
roddy
she
said
it
was
very
unfortunate
that
was
all
it
was
rather
beastly
of
you
and
as
for
nita
here
he
broke
in
no
i
say
you
must
say
anythin
about
her
she
was
a
little
bit
to
blame
it
just
well
we
leave
nita
she
is
of
any
importance
anyway
the
point
is
that
things
have
been
wrong
for
months
between
us
and
as
we
been
married
very
long
that
a
pity
this
has
just
brought
things
to
a
head
that
all
no
said
roddy
firmly
no
rachel
that
ai
fair
to
nita
i
know
it
is
nice
but
i
must
put
that
out
fair
and
square
fair
and
square
to
nita
we
had
a
jolly
old
drive
to
hawes
rippin
day
cold
as
anythin
with
the
horse
just
spankin
along
and
then
the
rockingtons
were
jolly
and
the
lunch
was
jolly
and
back
we
came
we
looked
about
the
house
for
you
and
heard
you
were
still
out
walkin
so
we
just
strolled
about
the
garden
a
bit
and
then
well
anyway
nita
simply
had
nothin
to
do
with
it
it
was
so
rippin
and
jolly
after
the
drive
and
all
that
i
just
kissed
her
all
in
a
second
i
just
felt
i
had
to
beastly
weak
of
me
he
finally
added
in
a
contemplative
tone
well
that
disposes
of
nita
said
rachel
do
let
mention
her
again
meanwhile
what
sort
of
life
am
i
going
to
have
if
are
going
to
sweep
over
you
like
this
continually
besides
it
rather
early
days
is
it
we
have
been
married
half
a
year
yet
no
said
roddy
slowly
no
we
have
and
it
simply
beastly
i
a
perfect
swine
when
i
married
you
the
one
thing
i
meant
to
do
was
to
be
just
as
kind
to
you
as
i
jolly
well
could
be
and
give
you
a
perfectly
rippin
time
and
here
i
am
hurtin
you
like
anything
she
moved
impatiently
never
mind
that
roddy
you
been
very
kind
and
i
sure
you
have
given
anything
for
me
not
to
have
come
into
the
garden
just
when
i
did
so
as
to
have
avoided
hurting
me
but
what
i
do
know
is
that
you
not
straight
with
me
you
know
i
told
you
before
we
were
married
that
the
one
thing
that
mattered
was
truth
truth
to
oneself
and
truth
to
everyone
else
well
we
have
been
straight
with
one
another
for
a
single
instant
you
done
any
number
of
things
that
would
be
wrong
to
you
if
i
knew
about
them
but
would
be
in
the
least
wrong
if
i
did
of
course
said
roddy
no
feller
tells
his
wife
everything
that
would
be
absurd
i
think
things
are
worse
if
people
know
about
whom
it
hurts
to
know
worse
she
was
suddenly
confronted
now
with
a
roddy
whose
assurance
and
confidence
in
his
own
personality
startled
her
because
he
had
never
been
gifted
with
words
and
liked
to
be
in
the
company
of
dogs
and
horses
she
had
fancied
that
he
had
no
ideas
about
anything
rachel
was
a
great
deal
younger
than
she
knew
and
a
great
deal
more
contemptuous
of
the
other
half
world
than
her
experience
of
it
justified
strangely
enough
this
confidence
on
roddy
part
angered
her
more
than
anything
else
could
have
done
the
fact
is
that
since
our
marriage
we
never
got
to
know
each
other
in
the
least
we
talk
and
go
to
places
together
and
you
give
me
things
and
i
give
you
things
and
that
all
i
do
know
you
and
now
after
i
ca
trust
you
he
coloured
a
little
at
that
but
said
nothing
she
went
on
rather
fast
and
her
breath
coming
between
her
words
but
i
not
going
to
be
so
silly
as
to
make
a
scene
because
i
saw
you
kissing
nita
raseley
she
simply
not
worth
thinking
about
but
you
ought
to
be
straighter
to
me
all
the
way
round
if
you
wanted
to
be
kind
to
me
as
you
say
then
you
might
have
taken
me
more
into
your
life
well
said
roddy
slowly
if
you
managed
to
love
me
a
bit
rachel
things
might
be
different
this
answer
was
so
utterly
unexpected
that
it
took
her
like
a
blow
that
roddy
should
attack
when
he
had
only
a
few
hours
before
been
discovered
so
abominably
what
do
you
mean
roddy
she
stammered
angrily
love
you
but
yes
he
persisted
doggedly
i
know
when
you
accepted
me
you
said
you
did
and
i
know
that
i
had
any
right
to
expect
it
but
i
believe
if
you
had
thought
me
such
a
silly
ass
and
had
looked
all
the
time
as
though
you
were
just
indulgin
my
silly
fancies
until
somethin
more
sensible
had
come
along
things
might
have
been
different
i
the
sort
of
feller
roddy
said
choosing
his
words
carefully
that
you
could
have
made
anythin
out
of
rachel
i
weak
in
some
ways
most
men
are
and
when
a
thing
comes
dancin
along
lookin
ever
so
temptin
why
then
i
generally
have
to
go
after
it
but
you
could
have
kept
me
rachel
more
than
anyone
i
ever
known
she
was
not
touched
nor
moved
only
angered
that
he
so
obviously
in
the
wrong
should
attempt
justification
yes
she
said
hotly
and
i
suppose
in
another
moment
you
be
telling
me
that
it
silly
of
me
to
be
angry
at
what
i
saw
this
afternoon
he
thought
it
out
a
moment
then
answered
no
it
was
perfectly
natural
of
course
only
i
do
think
you
ought
to
mind
much
if
you
really
cared
you
would
it
do
matter
so
much
what
i
do
if
i
still
like
you
best
moments
do
count
it
what
goes
on
all
the
time
that
matters
why
i
might
kiss
a
hundred
women
and
still
you
be
the
only
woman
who
mattered
to
me
i
never
cared
for
one
so
long
before
he
added
simply
then
as
she
said
nothing
he
went
on
i
never
been
sort
of
educated
never
cared
enough
for
anyone
to
give
things
up
i
would
have
given
things
up
for
you
if
you
wanted
me
to
but
you
really
are
we
a
little
off
the
point
roddy
she
flung
back
the
point
is
how
are
we
going
to
get
along
all
the
years
and
years
we
got
in
front
of
us
what
are
we
going
to
do
everybody
just
the
same
said
roddy
quietly
it
takes
a
lot
of
years
before
married
people
settle
down
we
ca
expect
to
be
any
different
but
although
he
spoke
so
quietly
he
watched
her
hoping
for
some
yielding
on
her
part
in
an
instant
had
she
come
to
him
she
would
have
seen
a
roddy
whom
she
had
never
seen
before
and
from
that
moment
onwards
would
have
had
a
power
over
him
that
nothing
could
have
shaken
so
delicately
hung
the
balance
between
them
but
she
was
filled
with
a
sense
of
her
own
wrongs
her
loneliness
the
injustice
of
it
all
at
that
moment
all
affection
for
roddy
had
left
her
she
would
only
have
been
glad
if
she
had
known
that
she
was
never
to
see
him
again
his
slow
voice
his
way
of
thinking
out
his
sentences
his
thick
clumsy
hands
and
his
red
face
everything
came
to
her
now
as
a
continuation
of
the
chains
that
she
had
worn
all
her
days
she
got
up
and
confronted
him
yes
she
said
fiercely
that
exactly
it
life
is
to
be
like
everyone
else
we
to
say
the
things
do
the
things
that
our
neighbours
say
and
do
because
your
friends
at
brooks
kiss
their
wives
friends
therefore
you
are
to
do
so
because
the
men
you
know
never
say
what
they
mean
and
lie
about
everything
they
do
therefore
you
do
the
same
oh
i
know
have
i
heard
it
all
my
life
have
my
precious
family
lived
on
lies
you
caught
it
all
from
my
delightful
grandmother
i
congratulate
you
what
if
i
have
he
said
she
a
friend
of
mine
rachel
she
been
dashed
good
to
me
you
not
to
say
a
word
against
her
i
hate
her
rachel
cried
passionately
all
my
life
she
been
over
me
for
years
she
been
my
enemy
if
she
stands
for
everything
that
you
believe
then
it
is
any
wonder
that
we
have
nothing
in
common
that
you
should
be
proud
of
this
afternoon
that
that
she
was
biting
her
lips
to
keep
back
the
tears
over
his
face
had
crept
a
sulky
obstinate
look
that
might
have
told
her
had
she
seen
it
that
she
was
driving
him
very
far
she
fine
he
said
she
made
england
what
it
is
you
all
for
ideas
rachel
and
for
truth
and
lots
of
things
but
you
difficult
to
live
with
very
well
roddy
thank
you
now
we
know
how
we
stand
i
at
least
owe
nita
a
debt
for
having
cleared
up
the
situation
if
you
find
it
difficult
with
me
i
can
at
least
return
the
compliment
and
i
have
at
any
rate
this
added
advantage
that
i
speak
the
truth
as
he
looked
at
her
across
the
room
he
saw
in
her
that
same
figure
that
he
seen
once
just
before
proposing
to
her
someone
foreign
unknown
he
felt
as
though
he
were
quarrelling
with
a
stranger
she
turned
and
went
for
a
long
while
he
stood
gazing
into
the
fire
his
hands
in
his
pockets
how
had
it
all
happened
why
had
they
let
it
come
to
that
kind
of
quarrel
when
they
might
so
easily
have
prevented
it
and
she
crying
bitterly
in
her
room
asked
herself
the
same
question
chapter
iv
rachel
and
christopher
and
roddy
i
christopher
had
snatched
his
first
holiday
for
two
years
and
was
abroad
during
the
january
of
when
the
seddons
were
in
town
february
march
and
april
they
spent
at
seddon
court
and
it
was
not
therefore
until
early
in
may
that
christopher
saw
rachel
she
had
dreaded
with
an
almost
fantastic
alarm
this
meeting
no
other
human
being
knew
her
so
honestly
and
accurately
as
did
christopher
and
the
change
in
her
that
he
would
at
once
discern
would
when
she
caught
the
reflection
of
it
in
his
eyes
mark
definitely
the
sinister
country
into
which
these
last
months
had
carried
her
it
had
seemed
as
though
some
malign
spirit
had
been
determined
to
make
the
most
of
that
quarrel
that
nita
raseley
had
provoked
both
roddy
and
rachel
hated
scenes
upon
that
at
least
they
were
agreed
and
from
their
determination
never
to
have
another
arose
a
deliberate
avoidance
of
any
plain
speaking
rachel
longing
for
honesty
found
herself
caught
in
a
thousand
deceits
roddy
avoiding
any
kind
of
analysis
found
that
everything
that
he
provided
in
conversation
seemed
to
lead
to
danger
he
was
now
always
ill
at
ease
in
rachel
company
he
had
stood
on
that
fatal
evening
more
strongly
for
the
beaminster
interest
than
he
had
intended
but
from
his
very
determination
to
maintain
his
new
independence
he
produced
the
duchess
for
rachel
benefit
at
every
turn
of
the
road
roddy
knew
that
the
duchess
feared
that
rachel
would
lead
him
from
her
side
and
that
she
received
with
rejoicing
every
sign
on
his
part
of
irritation
against
rachel
she
had
wanted
him
to
marry
her
granddaughter
because
that
bound
him
more
closely
to
her
but
she
had
not
perhaps
been
prepared
for
the
probable
effect
of
rachel
character
upon
him
the
duchess
therefore
made
throughout
these
months
a
third
member
of
their
company
roddy
finding
rachel
society
a
growing
embarrassment
spent
more
and
more
of
his
time
with
his
animals
and
his
tenants
and
labourers
but
all
this
time
he
was
conscious
in
a
dumb
way
of
unhappiness
and
a
puzzled
dismay
so
that
his
very
affection
for
rachel
produced
in
him
a
growing
irritation
that
it
should
be
so
needlessly
thwarted
things
were
all
wrong
and
his
resentment
of
his
own
failure
to
right
them
reacted
without
his
will
upon
the
very
person
whom
he
wished
to
propitiate
for
rachel
these
months
were
baffling
in
their
hideous
discomfort
her
affection
for
roddy
was
there
but
it
was
swallowed
by
her
desperate
efforts
to
analyse
a
situation
that
was
in
definite
outline
no
situation
at
all
as
roddy
withdrew
her
loneliness
wrapped
her
round
and
in
every
day
that
added
to
her
distance
from
roddy
she
saw
the
active
and
malignant
agency
of
her
grandmother
she
was
intelligent
enough
to
be
aware
that
in
this
constant
vision
of
the
duchess
she
was
outstepping
the
probabilities
but
her
early
years
and
the
precipitation
with
which
she
had
been
shot
out
of
them
into
an
atmosphere
that
unexpectedly
resembled
their
own
earlier
surroundings
seemed
to
point
to
some
diabolical
agency
oh
when
i
get
free
of
this
had
been
her
earlier
cry
and
now
the
foreboding
that
she
was
never
to
be
free
of
it
until
she
died
terrified
her
with
its
possibility
imagine
her
brought
up
in
a
stuffy
house
with
windows
tightly
closed
in
full
vision
of
a
high
road
imagine
her
promised
the
freedom
of
the
road
at
a
future
time
imagine
her
liberated
at
last
rushing
into
the
new
life
and
finding
that
after
all
the
walls
of
the
house
were
still
about
her
and
about
her
now
for
ever
her
one
reserve
during
the
early
months
of
the
year
at
seddon
had
been
her
letters
to
francis
breton
his
letters
to
her
had
been
a
series
of
he
had
restrained
himself
in
so
far
as
appealing
to
her
simply
on
the
score
of
their
relationship
and
his
enmity
to
the
head
of
the
house
she
had
replied
revealing
her
sympathy
hinting
at
rebellion
on
her
own
side
and
feeling
after
the
writing
of
every
letter
a
hatred
of
her
own
deceit
a
curiously
heightened
sense
of
affection
for
roddy
above
all
a
conviction
that
impulses
were
of
their
own
agency
working
to
some
climax
that
she
could
not
or
would
not
control
the
foreign
blood
in
her
the
english
blood
in
him
baffled
their
advances
toward
one
another
everything
that
rachel
did
now
seemed
to
roddy
so
close
to
melodrama
that
it
was
best
to
use
silence
for
his
weapon
all
roddy
actions
were
to
rachel
further
illustrations
of
beaminster
muddle
and
personality
had
roddy
called
out
of
rachel
the
great
depth
of
passion
and
reality
that
she
inherited
from
her
mother
her
own
love
of
him
would
have
solved
everything
but
that
he
could
not
call
from
her
nor
ever
would
for
rachel
she
saw
in
him
now
a
possibility
of
perpetual
infidelity
and
at
every
suspicion
of
it
her
disgust
both
at
herself
and
him
grew
because
that
possibility
did
not
move
her
more
they
came
up
to
london
at
the
beginning
of
may
and
hid
very
successfully
from
the
world
the
widening
breach
to
rachel
it
was
sheer
terror
to
discover
the
thrill
that
the
adjacence
of
elliston
square
to
saxton
square
gave
her
in
this
one
there
was
enough
to
present
her
with
night
after
night
of
sleepless
misery
she
visited
the
duchess
and
found
that
her
presence
was
continually
demanded
every
visit
was
a
battle
show
me
how
you
are
treating
him
whether
he
cares
for
you
have
you
found
him
out
tell
me
everything
i
will
tell
you
nothing
i
will
come
here
day
after
day
and
you
shall
gather
nothing
from
me
i
have
escaped
you
indeed
you
have
not
escaped
me
my
power
over
you
is
only
now
beginning
no
word
between
them
but
the
most
civil
there
was
no
trace
in
the
old
woman
now
of
her
earlier
irony
no
sign
in
rachel
of
irritation
or
rebellion
but
the
girl
knew
that
war
was
declared
that
her
only
ally
was
one
in
whose
alliance
lay
for
her
the
very
heart
of
danger
all
these
things
she
might
hide
from
the
world
from
christopher
she
knew
that
she
could
hide
nothing
ii
it
was
on
an
early
afternoon
in
may
that
christopher
had
tea
with
rachel
he
had
waited
for
his
visit
with
very
real
anxiety
the
letters
that
he
had
had
from
her
had
been
unsatisfactory
not
because
they
were
actively
expressive
of
unhappiness
but
because
there
was
an
effort
in
every
word
of
them
rachel
had
never
found
it
difficult
to
write
to
him
before
he
was
also
uneasy
because
he
had
been
against
this
marriage
from
the
beginning
he
did
as
he
said
to
the
duchess
know
rachel
better
than
anyone
else
knew
her
he
knew
her
from
his
love
for
her
and
also
from
that
scientific
study
that
he
applied
in
his
profession
and
he
had
found
too
in
her
as
he
had
found
in
breton
some
strain
of
fierce
helplessness
as
of
an
animal
caught
in
a
trap
that
especially
moved
his
interest
and
affection
was
rachel
marriage
a
disaster
if
so
she
had
certainly
managed
to
conceal
it
for
even
the
duchess
did
not
know
of
that
he
was
sure
if
rachel
were
indeed
unhappy
would
she
come
to
him
as
she
used
to
come
to
him
what
change
had
marriage
wrought
in
her
it
was
one
of
those
may
days
when
the
weather
is
hot
before
london
is
ready
it
was
a
day
of
tension
buildings
streets
quivered
beneath
a
sun
in
whose
gaze
there
was
no
kindliness
nor
comfort
christopher
drove
from
eaton
square
where
for
some
hours
he
had
been
engaged
in
preventing
an
old
man
from
dying
when
both
the
old
man
himself
and
all
his
friends
and
relations
were
convinced
that
death
was
the
best
thing
for
him
sloane
street
ran
like
white
steel
before
his
eyes
not
dimly
veiled
as
he
had
so
often
seen
it
park
lane
offered
houses
that
stared
with
haughty
faces
upon
a
world
that
would
they
knew
do
anything
for
money
elliston
square
itself
was
white
and
sterile
the
town
was
on
this
afternoon
irritated
sinister
feet
ached
upon
its
pavements
and
hearts
were
suddenly
clutched
with
foreboding
as
he
ascended
in
the
lift
to
her
flat
he
knew
that
did
he
find
that
this
marriage
was
truly
a
misadventure
for
rachel
then
until
his
death
he
would
reproach
himself
for
some
weak
inaction
some
hesitation
when
first
he
had
heard
that
it
was
to
be
he
protested
but
now
he
felt
that
he
should
have
done
more
soon
he
had
his
answer
to
all
his
questions
he
saw
at
once
that
rachel
was
no
longer
the
impulsive
nervous
girl
whom
he
had
always
known
she
was
a
girl
no
longer
her
eyes
greeted
him
now
steadily
she
seemed
taller
and
her
body
was
in
perfect
control
very
tall
and
slim
and
dark
her
cheeks
pale
but
shadowed
a
little
with
the
shadow
deepening
beneath
her
eyes
her
mouth
that
had
always
been
too
large
had
had
before
a
delightful
quality
of
uncertainty
so
that
smiles
and
frowns
and
alarms
distress
and
happiness
all
hovered
near
it
was
now
grave
and
composed
her
limbs
had
always
moved
unsteadily
and
with
the
awkward
lack
of
control
of
a
child
now
there
was
no
kind
of
impulse
every
movement
was
considered
and
that
was
the
first
thing
that
christopher
saw
that
nothing
that
rachel
now
did
or
said
was
spontaneous
there
was
less
in
her
now
to
remind
him
of
her
foreign
blood
the
flat
was
comfortable
but
more
commonplace
than
it
would
have
been
had
it
been
rachel
only
he
kissed
her
as
he
had
always
done
and
he
fancied
that
she
clung
for
a
moment
to
him
as
her
hands
went
up
to
his
coat
he
settled
his
big
loose
body
and
looked
across
at
her
christopher
was
no
subtle
analyser
of
other
people
emotions
his
own
feelings
were
never
complicated
and
he
expected
life
to
run
on
plain
and
simple
lines
of
likes
and
dislikes
sorrow
anger
love
and
hatred
if
someone
of
whom
he
was
fond
made
a
direct
appeal
to
him
his
simple
remedies
were
often
wonderfully
useful
he
was
no
fool
and
he
had
been
brought
during
a
great
number
of
years
into
the
most
direct
relations
with
men
and
women
but
if
that
direct
appeal
was
not
made
then
he
was
frightened
and
baffled
he
was
frightened
of
rachel
now
he
knew
instantly
that
instead
of
appealing
she
would
defend
herself
from
him
some
mysterious
conviction
seemed
to
forebode
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
help
her
he
was
essentially
of
those
who
believing
in
goodness
and
virtue
and
the
glorious
millennium
are
contented
quite
simply
with
that
belief
and
might
if
they
stated
those
simplicities
irritate
the
scoffers
but
he
was
saved
because
he
made
statements
on
the
rarest
occasions
and
lived
his
life
instead
here
however
was
a
crisis
in
his
relations
with
rachel
that
no
platitudes
could
satisfy
did
he
not
touch
her
now
he
might
never
touch
her
again
in
a
situation
that
was
beyond
him
he
was
always
hopelessly
his
love
for
rachel
was
so
tremendous
a
thing
in
him
that
a
statement
of
it
should
surely
have
been
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
but
he
saw
in
her
eyes
that
to
challenge
her
with
my
dear
you
know
how
i
love
you
tell
me
what
the
matter
would
frighten
her
to
absolute
silence
i
going
to
tell
you
nothing
she
seemed
to
say
to
him
unless
you
move
me
in
spite
of
myself
but
if
i
do
tell
you
now
i
shall
never
tell
you
well
my
dear
he
said
smiling
at
her
how
are
you
after
all
this
time
i
all
right
she
answered
smiling
back
at
him
it
is
good
to
see
you
again
tell
me
all
about
your
holiday
tell
me
about
yours
first
oh
there
is
very
much
to
tell
i
enjoyed
it
all
enormously
of
course
what
did
you
enjoy
most
oh
some
of
the
smaller
towns
rapallo
for
oh
yes
and
bologna
was
fascinating
not
rome
and
florence
in
a
way
but
there
were
too
many
tourists
rome
one
got
to
stay
in
i
sure
that
first
view
was
disappointing
and
how
did
roddy
if
i
may
call
him
roddy
enjoy
it
immensely
i
think
he
liked
the
country
better
than
the
towns
though
you
saw
lots
of
pictures
heaps
roddy
enjoyed
them
enormously
i
no
idea
he
knew
so
much
about
them
oh
it
was
all
lovely
and
such
colours
such
light
london
seems
like
a
cellar
even
in
june
there
followed
then
a
pause
that
swelled
and
swelled
between
them
until
it
resembled
some
dreadful
monster
horribly
stationed
there
to
separate
them
christopher
looked
at
rachel
but
she
refused
to
meet
his
eyes
i
lost
her
i
shall
never
see
her
again
he
thought
with
despair
two
years
ago
he
would
have
gone
to
her
put
his
arms
around
her
kissed
her
and
drawn
from
her
at
once
her
trouble
he
could
not
do
that
now
your
turn
chris
dear
tell
me
about
your
holidays
oh
mine
do
count
i
went
to
brittany
first
then
up
to
andrews
with
another
man
to
play
golf
you
looking
splendidly
well
and
you
thinner
what
was
brittany
like
delightful
have
you
ever
been
there
never
i
must
get
roddy
to
take
me
just
suit
him
i
should
think
to
christopher
intense
relief
tea
was
brought
he
came
to
the
table
and
then
for
an
instant
he
did
catch
her
eyes
saw
tears
in
them
and
behind
the
tears
some
appeal
to
him
to
help
her
her
hand
was
shaking
how
silly
of
me
to
spill
your
tea
i
so
sorry
let
me
pour
it
back
rachel
he
began
but
a
servant
entered
with
something
and
he
waited
when
they
were
alone
again
standing
over
her
as
though
he
were
afraid
that
she
would
escape
him
he
plunged
rachel
dear
we
talking
as
though
we
never
met
before
never
been
shy
with
me
like
this
if
marriage
is
going
to
make
a
stranger
of
you
i
shall
break
young
seddon
neck
no
she
said
in
a
voice
that
was
between
laughter
and
tears
of
course
chris
things
are
just
the
same
between
us
only
only
well
i
married
and
one
thing
and
another
you
know
he
caught
both
her
hands
you
perfectly
happy
she
met
his
eyes
perfectly
happier
than
you
ever
been
in
your
life
she
dropped
her
eyes
happier
than
i
ever
been
in
my
life
and
you
come
to
me
just
the
same
if
there
any
kind
of
trouble
of
course
you
promise
i
promise
they
talked
then
for
a
little
time
of
other
things
but
he
was
not
satisfied
rachel
soul
caught
away
in
alarm
was
still
beyond
his
grasp
at
last
feeling
that
the
moments
were
precious
and
that
roddy
might
at
any
instant
appear
he
sat
down
on
the
sofa
beside
her
rachel
dear
something
worrying
you
you
wo
tell
me
nothing
worrying
ah
but
i
know
well
if
you
wo
you
wo
but
if
you
knew
how
much
i
loved
you
you
feel
that
you
were
cruel
not
to
let
me
help
you
chris
but
there
is
but
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
look
here
he
said
perhaps
you
feel
later
on
you
can
talk
to
me
just
come
straight
away
if
you
do
feel
that
he
went
on
do
be
frightened
my
dear
if
there
are
a
whole
heap
of
new
emotions
new
instincts
stirred
in
you
by
marriage
just
take
them
all
as
they
come
it
all
progress
you
know
do
be
frightened
of
anything
just
take
the
animal
by
the
head
and
look
at
it
that
led
him
to
speak
about
brun
tiger
he
explained
it
the
force
in
people
the
way
they
either
grappled
with
the
creature
and
at
last
trained
it
to
help
them
with
their
work
in
the
world
or
ignored
it
silenced
it
allowed
it
at
last
to
die
and
so
cosy
and
lazily
comfortable
passed
to
their
day
end
but
had
nevertheless
missed
the
whole
purpose
of
life
he
enlarged
on
that
and
showed
the
connection
of
the
individual
tiger
with
the
welfare
of
the
world
so
that
everyone
who
denied
his
tiger
added
to
his
world
muddle
and
confusion
and
at
last
there
would
come
an
inevitable
crisis
when
war
would
spring
up
between
those
who
had
grappled
with
their
tiger
and
those
who
had
not
one
knows
one
own
tiger
absolutely
of
oneself
one
knows
it
and
has
of
oneself
the
choice
whether
to
grapple
or
not
at
least
that
what
i
gathered
he
meant
i
know
it
struck
me
at
the
time
oh
she
said
with
a
sigh
that
quivered
through
her
whole
body
so
to
talk
but
it
true
what
he
says
i
know
it
at
last
christopher
got
up
to
go
he
did
not
know
whether
he
had
done
any
good
he
felt
that
he
was
a
miserable
failure
and
he
had
a
foreboding
that
one
day
he
would
be
ashamed
indeed
that
he
had
not
helped
her
do
something
a
voice
seemed
to
tell
him
you
regret
all
your
life
you
regret
he
turned
and
held
again
her
hands
in
his
rachel
dear
tell
me
her
hands
were
chill
and
lifeless
her
voice
caught
oh
dr
chris
then
she
suddenly
stepped
back
from
him
all
right
i
all
right
come
again
soon
chris
dear
come
soon
he
left
her
and
found
his
way
into
the
hot
breathless
street
after
he
had
gone
rachel
sat
staring
beyond
the
room
out
on
to
the
white
walls
of
the
houses
and
the
green
branches
of
the
trees
in
the
square
roddy
came
in
all
the
afternoon
he
had
been
thinking
about
her
at
one
moment
he
was
furious
with
the
discomfort
that
life
was
now
becoming
to
him
at
another
moment
he
was
imagining
little
plans
that
would
sweep
all
the
discomfort
away
all
this
spring
they
had
been
miserable
together
now
was
beginning
a
time
that
was
always
jolly
in
london
and
yet
he
could
not
enjoy
a
moment
of
it
did
she
dislike
him
instead
of
liking
him
or
did
he
like
her
instead
of
loving
her
it
would
all
be
so
easy
just
the
same
as
any
other
couple
ever
since
that
silly
nita
incident
there
had
been
this
restraint
and
yet
how
could
that
be
the
cause
rachel
had
made
nothing
of
it
it
was
because
it
had
meant
so
little
to
her
that
he
had
chafed
so
at
the
remembrance
of
it
she
was
fond
of
him
he
knew
that
she
was
miserably
unhappy
he
loved
her
and
he
was
miserably
unhappy
damn
this
weather
he
looked
at
her
wondered
what
would
happen
did
he
cross
over
and
suddenly
kiss
her
knew
that
he
would
see
her
struggle
to
be
kind
to
give
him
what
he
wanted
knew
that
that
would
hurt
most
damnably
and
that
he
would
be
in
a
bad
temper
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
and
would
wonder
why
so
with
a
muttered
word
he
went
out
and
up
to
his
had
a
bath
and
then
lay
reading
with
serious
brows
winning
until
his
man
told
him
that
it
was
time
to
dress
slowly
and
with
the
absorbed
care
that
he
always
gave
to
these
preparations
he
made
himself
ready
for
the
beaminster
dinner
chapter
v
lizzie
journey
i
so
thy
great
gift
upon
misprision
growing
comes
home
again
on
better
judgment
making
thus
have
i
had
thee
as
a
dream
doth
flatter
in
sleep
a
king
but
waking
no
such
matter
william
shakespeare
i
during
this
year
lizzie
rand
was
glad
that
she
had
so
much
to
do
as
she
had
never
until
now
given
the
romance
in
her
an
opportunity
for
freedom
so
had
she
never
before
realized
the
amazing
invasion
upon
life
that
that
same
romance
might
threaten
indeed
by
the
early
summer
months
of
threaten
was
no
longer
an
honest
definition
for
now
this
same
romance
had
invaded
had
conquered
had
confronted
the
very
citadels
of
lizzie
heart
citadels
never
surveyed
nor
challenged
at
any
time
before
nevertheless
even
now
portland
place
noticed
no
change
in
miss
rand
norris
newton
dorchester
would
still
had
they
been
challenged
have
protested
that
miss
rand
had
no
conception
of
the
softer
more
sentimental
side
of
life
she
was
there
for
discipline
and
order
norris
had
been
known
to
be
led
a
fearful
dance
by
young
women
time
and
again
newton
had
passionately
adored
the
late
newton
until
a
sudden
chill
had
carried
him
to
agnes
bare
street
cemetery
whither
newton
every
sunday
did
still
make
her
stately
pilgrimage
even
dorchester
had
once
it
was
said
paid
grim
attentions
to
a
soldier
who
had
unhappily
found
in
some
fluffy
young
woman
a
more
hopeful
comfort
here
above
and
below
stairs
passion
had
marked
its
victims
miss
rand
only
could
have
felt
no
touch
of
it
she
sometimes
wondered
at
herself
that
she
could
so
calmly
and
dispassionately
separate
the
one
life
from
the
other
never
within
that
neat
stern
room
at
portland
place
was
there
a
shudder
or
sudden
invading
thrill
at
some
flashing
recollection
or
imagination
to
her
work
every
nerve
every
energy
was
given
now
indeed
more
than
ever
before
in
her
experience
of
it
did
portland
place
demand
her
presence
increasingly
throughout
these
months
of
was
the
solemn
heavy
air
unsettled
lizzie
to
whom
all
impression
came
with
sharpening
acuteness
had
seen
in
the
appearance
success
and
marriage
of
rachel
beaminster
the
disturbing
elements
at
work
things
will
never
be
the
same
here
again
she
had
said
to
herself
it
was
of
course
through
lady
adela
that
lizzie
studied
the
house
the
duchess
she
never
saw
but
it
was
lady
adela
attitude
before
and
after
those
interviews
with
her
mother
that
told
their
story
lady
adela
had
never
until
now
appeared
an
interesting
figure
to
lizzie
but
now
forth
from
the
dry
sterile
husk
of
her
a
life
pathetic
struggling
against
heritages
of
dumb
years
tried
to
come
lady
adela
was
unhappy
the
very
foundations
of
her
existence
threatened
to
dismay
her
at
any
moment
by
their
insecurity
within
her
the
beaminster
tradition
urged
before
lizzie
rand
at
any
rate
the
maintenance
of
dignity
and
indifference
but
the
novelty
to
her
of
all
this
disturbance
brought
with
it
a
hapless
inability
to
deal
with
it
and
again
and
again
little
exclamations
little
surprised
wonders
at
what
the
world
could
be
coming
to
little
confused
clutchings
at
anything
that
offered
stability
showed
lizzie
that
trouble
was
on
every
side
of
her
then
through
the
house
rumour
began
to
twist
its
way
her
grace
was
not
so
well
the
old
lady
was
breaking
up
this
in
the
close
security
of
shuttered
rooms
below
stairs
no
one
could
say
whence
these
whispers
gathered
dorchester
would
admit
nothing
her
own
position
in
the
servants
hall
was
that
of
a
lofty
uncompromising
female
jove
and
she
knew
well
enough
that
her
supremacy
over
norris
and
newton
depended
on
her
mistress
supremacy
over
the
world
in
general
not
for
her
then
to
admit
ill
health
indeed
no
her
grace
has
been
better
of
late
than
for
years
past
but
norris
and
newton
were
not
to
be
taken
in
they
were
truly
proud
now
of
their
alliance
with
the
beaminster
family
royal
but
supposing
her
grace
were
to
leave
this
world
to
rule
in
a
better
one
here
gone
or
low
as
norris
remarked
why
then
le
roi
est
mort
vive
le
roi
and
the
crown
might
in
the
meanwhile
have
passed
elsewhere
you
mark
my
words
newton
said
to
norris
grace
will
go
old
victorier
will
go
and
where
the
beaminster
crowd
be
then
i
ask
you
times
are
movin
too
quick
i
would
give
a
toss
for
your
birth
and
debrett
and
all
in
another
twenty
years
to
lizzie
also
there
came
other
signs
of
the
times
she
noticed
that
now
the
relations
and
friends
of
the
family
gathered
more
frequently
together
than
ever
before
within
her
memory
the
duke
lord
richard
were
continually
in
the
house
and
the
adherents
lady
carloes
lord
crewner
the
massiters
and
all
the
others
called
dined
came
to
tea
throughout
it
all
there
was
no
expression
of
any
change
in
the
family
policy
to
lizzie
lady
adela
admitted
nothing
only
there
were
occasions
when
almost
against
her
will
she
asked
for
advice
was
uncertain
a
little
vague
a
little
even
appealing
a
little
here
lizzie
was
exactly
right
assisted
and
yet
admitted
no
need
for
assistance
her
tact
was
perfect
lizzie
had
also
lady
seddon
to
besiege
her
attention
to
her
considerable
surprise
rachel
had
written
to
her
three
times
during
this
year
on
each
occasion
there
had
been
some
definite
reason
for
writing
but
behind
the
reason
there
had
been
some
implied
friendliness
and
lizzie
had
in
her
turn
sent
answers
that
were
more
than
businesslike
replies
lizzie
had
seen
rachel
several
times
in
january
and
at
each
meeting
her
impression
of
rachel
unhappiness
had
grown
there
been
three
of
you
lizzie
said
to
herself
there
was
the
girl
in
the
schoolroom
and
a
fierce
awkward
difficult
creature
she
was
there
was
the
girl
in
her
first
season
and
a
delightful
joyful
radiant
creature
she
was
and
now
well
there
a
girl
married
fierce
again
suffering
again
above
all
afraid
of
herself
in
may
rachel
asked
lizzie
to
go
and
see
her
and
lizzie
went
that
meeting
was
in
no
way
personal
rachel
seemed
less
friendly
than
she
had
been
on
that
day
a
year
ago
when
she
had
been
to
lizzie
but
behind
all
that
outward
stiffness
the
appeal
was
there
she
wants
me
to
help
her
thought
lizzie
she
too
proud
now
to
ask
me
the
time
will
come
though
all
this
was
connected
she
knew
with
the
fortunes
of
the
house
through
lord
john
lord
richard
the
duke
lady
adela
dorchester
norris
newton
the
spirit
of
uneasiness
was
abroad
the
duchess
during
these
months
more
than
ever
before
was
present
in
every
room
and
passage
of
the
house
the
shadow
of
some
coming
event
hovered
ii
over
lizzie
other
life
also
the
duchess
hovered
were
any
disaster
to
snatch
her
grace
from
the
domination
of
this
world
into
a
comparatively
humble
position
in
the
next
lizzie
did
not
doubt
that
the
beaminsters
would
once
more
take
francis
breton
into
their
ranks
it
was
the
duchess
who
held
the
gate
against
him
the
romantic
side
of
her
did
not
hold
complete
dominion
she
knew
that
were
francis
breton
once
more
accepted
by
the
family
his
distance
from
her
would
be
greatly
increased
were
he
on
the
other
hand
to
marry
her
whilst
he
was
yet
an
exile
then
had
she
no
fear
of
after
consequences
she
could
hold
her
own
with
anyone
she
had
now
very
little
doubt
that
he
loved
her
she
had
seen
during
the
last
year
the
flame
of
some
passion
burning
in
his
eyes
increasingly
he
depended
upon
her
and
found
opportunities
for
being
with
her
there
was
no
other
woman
whom
he
saw
of
that
she
was
convinced
often
he
had
been
about
to
tell
her
some
secret
and
then
had
refrained
she
thought
that
he
was
waiting
until
he
could
be
quite
assured
that
she
loved
him
and
she
had
fancied
that
since
that
day
in
last
december
when
the
first
snow
had
fallen
and
they
had
had
that
little
talk
together
he
had
been
much
happier
as
though
he
were
now
convinced
of
her
love
for
him
the
spring
passed
and
still
his
confession
did
not
come
with
the
early
summer
he
seemed
to
be
once
more
unhappy
and
unsettled
and
throughout
may
she
scarcely
saw
him
then
in
july
he
asked
her
whether
she
would
dine
with
him
and
go
to
the
theatre
he
had
two
dress
circle
tickets
for
lemiter
something
told
her
that
on
this
evening
he
would
speak
to
her
as
she
dressed
her
fingers
trembled
so
that
buttons
and
hooks
and
laces
were
of
terrible
difficulty
in
the
glass
she
saw
her
cheeks
flaming
she
wished
she
were
taller
not
so
sturdy
the
lines
of
her
face
she
thought
were
all
so
set
as
though
they
knew
well
for
what
purpose
they
were
there
business
here
for
they
seemed
to
say
for
once
she
envied
her
sister
fair
rounded
fluffiness
her
black
evening
dress
was
fashionable
almost
smart
but
just
a
little
stern
she
fastened
some
dark
red
carnations
into
her
waist
and
hung
around
her
throat
a
chain
of
tiny
pearls
her
only
piece
of
jewellery
her
hair
was
restrained
and
disciplined
she
could
not
extract
from
it
any
waves
or
soft
indulgencies
at
the
end
staring
at
her
reflection
she
let
herself
go
he
seen
me
all
this
time
as
i
am
how
silly
to
try
to
alter
things
her
face
glowed
the
pearls
and
carnations
seemed
to
smile
encouragement
to
her
what
possibilities
had
this
new
this
wonderful
lizzie
rand
what
a
life
might
be
hers
what
a
happy
fortunate
woman
she
was
god
how
grateful
she
was
rand
saw
them
off
in
a
with
an
air
of
reluctance
it
always
hurt
her
that
anyone
should
go
to
the
theatre
without
her
of
course
lizzie
was
old
enough
by
now
to
look
after
herself
but
at
the
same
time
this
breton
was
no
safe
character
and
it
would
have
been
altogether
nicer
if
lizzie
had
suggested
her
company
lizzie
had
not
suggested
it
with
a
shiver
rand
resigned
herself
to
an
evening
made
hideous
by
a
vision
of
a
world
crowded
with
theatres
through
whose
portals
gay
audiences
were
pouring
of
course
it
selfish
of
her
she
said
again
and
again
to
daisy
selfish
is
the
only
word
meanwhile
the
cab
was
for
lizzie
a
chariot
of
happiness
he
looked
splendid
more
romantic
than
he
had
ever
been
with
his
pointed
beard
his
armless
sleeve
buttoned
across
on
to
his
coat
his
shining
his
clothes
fitting
so
perfectly
poor
though
he
was
he
always
stood
up
as
smart
as
anyone
the
duke
or
lord
john
were
no
smarter
did
he
realize
she
wondered
that
the
edge
of
his
hand
touched
the
silk
of
her
dress
did
he
notice
the
absurd
way
that
the
pearls
jumped
up
and
down
on
her
throat
did
he
feel
the
little
shiver
of
happiness
that
ran
through
her
body
and
out
at
her
toes
and
fingers
the
chariot
was
dark
but
beyond
it
there
were
piled
lighted
buildings
before
these
ran
streets
that
flung
dark
figures
here
one
by
one
now
in
throngs
against
the
glittering
colour
she
could
not
believe
that
anyone
there
by
the
lumbering
cab
could
show
happiness
that
could
equal
hers
had
she
been
coldly
surveying
from
the
careful
distance
of
an
outside
observer
these
emotions
in
some
other
woman
she
would
have
demanded
her
reasons
for
such
expectation
of
happiness
but
it
was
her
very
inexperience
of
any
other
such
affair
in
her
life
that
allowed
her
now
to
rest
assured
as
he
touched
her
hand
to
help
her
into
the
restaurant
she
was
sure
by
the
beating
of
her
heart
that
she
could
not
be
deceived
the
restaurant
was
in
pall
mall
and
as
she
went
in
she
noticed
the
string
of
faithful
people
waiting
round
the
corner
of
her
theatre
she
was
glad
that
there
were
so
many
others
enjoying
themselves
they
sat
at
a
little
round
table
on
a
balcony
and
below
them
other
happy
people
were
laughing
and
talking
flowers
lights
women
not
so
beautiful
that
they
disheartened
one
and
from
the
open
windows
a
whir
a
rattle
a
shout
a
cry
a
bell
a
a
laugh
oh
the
world
was
turning
there
was
a
beautiful
dinner
but
she
was
far
too
happy
to
eat
much
he
seemed
to
understand
they
both
talked
a
little
but
it
was
it
appeared
implied
between
them
that
their
real
conversation
should
be
postponed
she
was
to
herself
an
utterly
new
lizzie
rand
inarticulate
uncertain
confused
what
this
the
papers
say
about
south
africa
yes
it
looks
as
though
there
were
going
to
be
trouble
there
but
you
can
trust
milner
a
strong
man
yes
i
suppose
so
but
it
seems
a
pity
that
this
conference
that
they
hoped
so
much
from
has
all
fallen
through
does
it
they
do
seem
obstinate
people
well
they
are
i
was
out
in
pretoria
in
obstinate
as
mules
but
there
wo
be
much
trouble
a
troop
or
two
of
our
fellows
have
only
got
to
show
their
faces
yes
of
course
is
that
a
pretty
woman
down
there
there
to
the
right
with
the
black
hair
and
the
diamonds
tall
but
tall
women
with
black
hair
and
boers
in
south
africa
were
merely
points
to
catch
hold
and
for
an
instant
the
thrill
of
the
contact
and
the
anticipation
and
the
glorious
vision
of
the
wonderful
future
him
all
this
time
she
closely
observed
he
was
not
entirely
at
his
ease
when
she
had
been
in
public
with
him
before
she
had
noticed
it
his
glance
at
every
his
conscious
summoning
of
control
lest
it
should
be
someone
whom
he
had
once
known
someone
who
might
now
perhaps
not
know
him
it
made
him
in
her
eyes
all
the
younger
all
the
more
happily
demanding
her
protection
how
terribly
she
loved
him
she
had
never
she
thought
realized
until
this
moment
the
haymarket
theatre
where
lemiter
had
been
given
to
a
grateful
world
for
nearly
two
hundred
nights
was
next
door
in
a
moment
they
were
there
and
the
band
was
playing
and
the
lights
were
up
and
then
the
band
was
not
playing
and
the
lights
were
down
and
she
was
instantly
conscious
of
the
places
where
his
body
touched
hers
and
of
his
hand
lying
white
upon
his
knee
she
lizzie
rand
most
perfect
of
private
secretaries
most
sedate
and
composed
of
women
found
it
all
that
her
could
secure
that
she
should
not
then
and
there
have
touched
that
hand
with
her
own
it
was
not
really
a
good
play
there
was
a
lady
lemiter
who
had
once
done
what
she
should
not
have
done
there
were
a
number
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
placed
round
her
by
the
author
in
order
that
she
should
for
the
benefit
of
as
many
audiences
as
possible
confess
what
she
done
during
the
first
and
second
acts
lemiter
made
little
dashes
towards
escape
and
the
author
naturally
omniscient
always
placed
someone
in
front
of
her
just
in
time
and
there
were
cries
of
not
this
way
my
good
woman
at
the
end
of
the
third
act
lemiter
thoroughly
bored
and
exasperated
turned
on
them
all
and
for
a
good
twenty
minutes
told
them
what
she
thought
of
them
during
the
fourth
act
they
all
assured
her
that
they
liked
her
very
much
and
that
as
it
was
now
eleven
and
she
lost
her
temper
so
successfully
that
the
house
would
certainly
be
filled
for
many
months
to
come
they
all
better
have
tea
or
dinner
whilst
a
young
couple
who
had
throughout
the
play
loved
one
another
and
quarrelled
made
it
up
again
when
the
play
was
at
an
end
lizzie
did
not
know
what
it
had
been
about
she
took
his
hand
and
when
he
was
about
to
hail
a
cab
stopped
him
let
walk
she
said
it
such
a
lovely
night
he
eagerly
agreed
and
they
started
iii
she
knew
that
her
moment
had
come
he
knew
too
she
could
tell
that
because
all
the
way
up
the
haymarket
he
said
nothing
piccadilly
circus
was
a
screaming
confusion
a
invited
you
to
come
and
hear
harry
and
clare
entertainers
lights
red
and
green
and
gold
flashed
and
advised
drinks
and
and
tobacco
ladies
highly
coloured
and
a
little
dishevelled
stared
haughtily
but
inquisitively
about
them
boys
shouted
newspapers
and
dived
under
horses
and
appeared
miraculously
delivered
from
the
wheels
of
omnibuses
it
was
a
rushing
whirling
confusion
and
through
it
his
arm
led
her
happier
in
his
secure
guard
than
in
anything
else
under
heaven
regent
street
was
quiet
and
softly
coloured
above
the
maelstrom
into
which
it
flowed
he
suddenly
began
i
got
something
i
want
to
tell
you
something
i
wanted
to
tell
you
for
a
long
time
you
must
have
seen
her
voice
coming
to
her
as
though
it
were
a
stranger
said
yes
at
the
same
time
looking
about
her
almost
unconsciously
she
registered
her
memory
of
the
place
and
the
hour
the
shelving
street
rising
with
its
lamps
reflected
before
them
a
bank
of
dark
cloud
that
had
suddenly
appeared
and
hung
sinister
against
the
night
sky
behind
the
white
houses
a
slip
of
a
silver
moon
surveying
this
same
cloud
with
anxiety
because
it
knew
that
soon
its
darkness
would
engulf
it
i
wanted
to
tell
you
he
began
again
this
long
time
it
needed
courage
and
things
during
this
last
year
have
rather
taken
my
courage
away
from
me
you
need
be
afraid
she
said
with
a
little
laugh
you
ought
to
know
by
this
time
that
you
can
tell
me
anything
mr
breton
yes
i
do
know
he
said
earnestly
of
course
i
know
what
you
been
to
me
all
this
last
year
i
simply
ca
think
how
i
have
kept
up
if
it
had
been
for
you
oh
please
she
said
no
but
it
true
even
with
you
it
been
a
bit
of
a
fight
he
paused
she
saw
that
the
black
cloud
had
already
swallowed
up
the
moon
and
that
a
few
raindrops
were
beginning
to
fall
he
went
on
you
must
have
seen
that
all
this
time
something
been
helping
me
i
never
spoken
to
you
but
you
known
the
moment
had
come
her
heart
had
surely
stopped
its
beat
and
she
was
glad
in
her
happiness
of
the
rain
that
was
now
falling
more
swiftly
i
do
know
he
stammered
a
little
it
so
difficult
it
come
to
this
that
i
must
speak
to
somebody
and
you
the
only
person
the
only
person
but
even
with
one
best
friends
one
knows
them
so
slightly
after
all
perhaps
you
think
it
very
wrong
at
that
word
it
was
as
though
a
great
hammer
had
of
a
sudden
hit
her
heart
and
slain
it
the
street
shining
with
the
rain
rose
ever
so
little
and
bent
towards
her
wrong
she
said
looking
up
at
him
yes
i
do
know
about
your
standards
you
been
always
so
kind
to
me
and
put
up
with
my
faults
and
so
i
been
encouraged
her
relief
should
have
awaked
the
gods
of
olympus
with
its
triumph
i
meant
everything
i
ever
said
yes
i
sure
you
have
and
that
why
i
think
you
understand
as
i
say
i
got
to
tell
someone
or
i
burst
it
just
this
it
my
cousin
rachel
lady
seddon
ever
since
we
first
met
in
your
room
been
my
whole
world
nothing
else
has
mattered
it
she
that
kept
me
all
these
months
from
going
under
she
my
life
my
whole
existence
now
and
in
the
world
to
come
if
there
is
one
oh
thank
god
he
cried
i
told
someone
at
last
if
you
do
approve
i
ca
help
it
i
know
you
keep
my
secret
and
after
all
it
nothing
very
terrible
content
to
go
on
like
this
just
seeing
her
sometimes
writing
to
her
sometimes
now
you
know
miss
rand
what
been
my
secret
all
this
time
i
felt
it
been
between
us
and
that
why
i
had
to
tell
you
be
twice
the
friends
that
we
were
now
that
i
told
you
and
i
must
i
have
someone
to
talk
to
about
her
sometimes
it
been
killing
me
getting
along
without
it
now
that
he
had
begun
words
poured
from
him
he
did
not
know
that
it
was
raining
he
saw
only
rachel
with
her
white
face
and
dark
hair
lizzie
pulled
her
wrap
about
her
she
was
very
cold
and
the
rain
was
coming
fast
he
was
suddenly
conscious
of
this
i
say
what
a
brute
i
am
it
pouring
he
called
a
passing
hansom
and
they
climbed
into
it
he
was
aware
that
she
had
said
nothing
there
he
said
you
wish
i
had
told
you
i
know
you
do
shocked
no
she
said
struggling
to
prevent
her
teeth
from
chattering
he
felt
her
shiver
why
you
shaking
with
cold
we
ought
to
have
walked
but
i
did
so
want
to
speak
to
you
about
this
we
must
talk
about
it
another
time
but
i
say
you
are
really
horrified
about
it
are
you
no
she
said
again
another
time
though
there
must
be
thunder
this
storm
makes
my
head
ache
she
could
say
no
more
the
rest
of
the
drive
was
in
silence
in
the
hall
she
thanked
him
for
her
delightful
evening
she
looked
through
the
door
and
wished
her
mother
and
sister
good
night
but
did
not
stay
to
discuss
incidents
well
said
rand
who
had
a
fine
list
of
questions
ready
about
the
play
there
selfishness
lizzie
locked
her
door
undressed
and
lay
down
like
a
sword
jagging
through
and
through
her
brain
and
piercing
from
there
down
to
her
heart
stabbed
the
refrain
oh
i
hate
her
i
hate
her
i
hate
her
so
she
lay
throughout
the
night
chapter
vi
all
the
beaminsters
we
must
expect
change
returned
chick
of
weather
asked
miss
tox
in
her
simplicity
of
everything
returned
chick
of
course
we
must
a
world
of
change
anyone
would
surprise
me
very
much
lucretia
and
would
greatly
alter
my
opinion
of
their
understanding
if
they
attempted
to
contradict
or
evade
what
is
so
perfectly
evident
change
exclaimed
chick
with
severe
philosophy
why
my
gracious
me
what
is
there
that
does
change
even
the
silkworm
who
i
am
sure
might
be
supposed
not
to
trouble
itself
about
such
subjects
changes
into
all
sorts
of
unexpected
things
continually
and
i
at
four
on
the
afternoon
of
wednesday
october
in
this
year
war
between
england
and
south
africa
was
declared
at
that
same
hour
on
that
same
afternoon
an
afternoon
party
was
given
by
lady
adela
beaminster
at
portland
place
and
all
the
more
important
believers
in
the
beaminster
religion
were
present
the
long
had
the
happy
property
of
extending
to
accommodate
its
company
and
now
shadowy
as
its
corners
always
were
it
yielded
the
impression
still
of
size
and
space
its
mirrors
reflecting
its
dark
green
walls
that
receded
from
the
figures
that
thronged
it
the
duchess
now
ross
portrait
of
her
hung
above
the
adams
fireplace
and
a
little
globe
of
light
shone
on
this
dark
october
day
up
into
that
sharp
and
wizened
face
and
lit
those
bending
fingers
and
flung
forward
the
dull
green
jade
and
the
dark
black
dress
many
people
were
present
the
duke
lord
john
lord
richard
of

also
of
course
lady
carloes
the
massiters
lord
crewner
monty
carfax
brun
maurice

the
novelist
and
his
wife
also
a
fine
collection
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
important
in
politics
in
the
graver
camps
of
society
also
a
certain
number
who
belonged
by
party
to
those
whom
brun
had
once
called
the
aristocrats
the
chichesters
the
medleys
the
darrants
old
lady
darrant
was
there
looking
like
a
cook
and
fred
chichester
and
his
kind
and
freckled
features
and
medley
who
had
married
judge
medley
only
son
of
the
democrats
of
the
ruddards
the
denisons
the
oaks
not
one
to
be
seen
the
men
and
women
who
stood
about
in
the
room
seemed
strangely
oddly
of
one
family
no
human
being
present
was
without
his
or
her
but
it
was
a
that
had
about
it
nothing
vulgar
or
strident
no
voice
in
that
room
was
raised
the
very
laughter
implied
here
we
are
in
the
very
court
of
our
temple
we
may
then
relax
a
little
for
a
time
at
any
rate
we
know
who
we
all
are
this
security
was
implied
on
every
hand
it
was
young
rorke
going
out
he
the
son
of
alice
branches
he
married
old
truddits
daughter
or
no
i
do
know
him
personally
but
dick
barnett
has
seen
him
once
or
twice
and
says
he
a
very
decent
feller
or
well
i
should
go
carefully
if
i
were
you
neither
the
massiters
nor
the
crawfords
know
her
and
in
fact
i
ca
find
anyone
who
does
had
a
stranger
penetrated
into
the
fastnesses
of
the
chichesters
or
the
medleys
he
would
have
been
overwhelmed
with
courtesy
and
politeness
and
unless
he
had
full
credentials
would
have
been
utterly
excluded
at
the
end
of
it
had
he
boldly
invaded
the
denisons
he
would
unless
he
could
prove
his
contribution
to
the
entertainment
of
the
day
have
been
told
frankly
that
he
was
not
wanted
had
he
passed
the
doors
of
no
and
had
no
proof
of
his
beaminster
faith
upon
him
norris
would
have
exchanged
with
him
a
quiet
word
or
two
and
he
would
have
found
himself
in
the
bright
spaces
of
portland
place
rachel
and
roddy
had
come
to
the
party
rachel
sat
on
a
high
chair
and
looked
stiff
and
pale
lady
darrant
bunched
up
in
an
was
beside
her
lady
darrant
emotions
were
divided
between
the
welfare
of
the
church
in
her
parish
in
wiltshire
and
the
welfare
of
her
only
son
a
boy
aged
twenty
who
supposed
to
be
studying
for
the
diplomatic
service
was
really
interested
in
race
meetings
and
polo
lady
darrant
had
like
most
of
the
aristocrats
a
tranquil
mind
sorrow
tragedies
perplexities
might
come
and
go
the
plain
surface
stability
was
in
no
way
disturbed
she
would
have
liked
to
possess
more
money
that
she
might
bestow
it
upon
the
church
and
she
would
have
preferred
that
her
son
should
place
foreign
languages
above
horses
but
since
these
things
were
not
so
god
knew
best
and
the
world
might
have
been
much
worse
none
of
her
friends
were
ever
agitated
outwardly
at
any
rate
life
was
calm
sure
proceeding
from
a
definite
commencement
to
a
definite
conclusion
and
god
knew
best
rumours
came
to
her
of
atheists
and
chorus
girls
and
american
millionaires
but
she
was
neither
alarmed
nor
dismayed
at
a
beaminster
entertainment
she
felt
that
she
was
among
strangers
her
account
of
such
an
affair
given
afterwards
to
friends
implied
that
this
world
into
which
she
had
glanced
was
not
her
world
lady
adela
frightened
her
and
the
mere
suggestion
of
the
duchess
whom
she
had
never
seen
threatened
more
fiercely
her
tranquillity
than
any
other
event
or
person
now
every
minute
or
so
she
flung
little
agitated
glances
at
the
portrait
at
the
back
of
her
mind
this
afternoon
was
the
reflection
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
war
and
that
quite
certainly
her
boy
tony
would
insist
on
helping
his
country
she
was
proud
that
he
should
insist
but
had
she
not
been
quite
so
confident
of
god
care
for
her
would
have
been
very
near
to
most
real
agitation
she
looked
at
rachel
timidly
and
wondered
whether
that
strange
fierce
pale
girl
would
be
sympathetic
she
had
heard
of
rachel
and
her
marriage
and
she
knew
that
that
rather
stout
young
man
standing
and
talking
to
lord
john
beaminster
was
the
husband
he
looked
kinder
than
she
did
lady
darrant
thought
it
terrible
about
this
horrid
war
is
it
she
said
at
last
rachel
watching
the
room
was
absorbed
by
her
own
thoughts
she
scarcely
noticed
the
little
woman
beside
her
she
saw
uncle
john
his
white
hair
and
happy
smile
and
large
rather
shapeless
body
his
way
of
laughing
with
his
head
flung
back
the
look
of
him
when
he
was
thinking
his
face
precisely
that
of
a
puzzled
pig
simply
to
see
him
there
across
the
room
brought
back
to
her
a
flood
of
memories
she
knew
that
she
had
avoided
him
lately
and
she
knew
too
that
he
was
unhappy
about
her
he
was
unhappy
poor
uncle
john
about
a
number
of
things
always
behind
his
laughter
and
cheerful
greetings
there
was
the
little
restless
distress
as
though
life
were
offering
him
just
now
more
than
he
could
control
rachel
looked
and
then
turned
her
eyes
away
yes
she
said
to
lady
darrant
i
hope
it
wo
be
very
much
they
say
that
a
week
or
two
will
see
the
end
of
it
truly
for
herself
this
afternoon
was
almost
too
difficult
for
her
she
had
received
that
morning
a
letter
from
francis
breton
asking
her
to
go
to
tea
with
him
in
his
rooms
one
day
within
the
following
week
she
had
never
been
to
his
room
she
had
not
met
him
once
during
the
whole
year
she
had
known
during
all
these
last
twelve
months
that
meeting
him
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
especial
claim
that
they
had
upon
one
another
that
claim
had
existed
since
that
day
of
their
first
coming
face
to
face
and
nothing
now
could
ever
alter
it
but
the
next
time
that
they
met
must
be
for
both
of
them
a
definite
landmark
she
might
either
decide
now
once
and
for
all
never
to
see
him
again
or
grasp
quite
definitely
the
possible
result
of
her
going
to
him
the
writing
of
this
letter
brought
at
last
upon
her
the
climax
that
she
had
been
avoiding
during
the
last
year
sitting
there
in
the
beaminster
camp
it
was
difficult
to
act
without
prejudice
with
the
exception
of
uncle
john
and
roddy
she
hated
them
all
after
all
if
she
were
to
refuse
to
see
francis
breton
did
it
solve
the
question
did
it
help
her
and
that
was
the
great
need
of
her
present
life
to
love
roddy
any
better
and
if
she
went
to
his
rooms
and
saw
him
would
not
the
truth
emerge
from
that
meeting
and
the
miserable
doubts
and
temptations
that
had
shadowed
her
since
her
marriage
be
cleared
away
for
ever
she
liked
roddy
and
did
not
love
him
nothing
could
alter
that
breton
and
she
belonged
to
a
world
that
was
hostile
to
this
world
that
she
was
now
in
nothing
could
alter
that
yes
she
would
go
and
see
breton
she
got
up
smiled
at
lady
darrant
and
went
across
the
room
to
talk
to
uncle
john
on
this
afternoon
she
had
a
great
overpowering
longing
for
someone
to
love
her
to
care
for
her
to
pity
her
to
take
her
into
their
arms
and
whisper
comfort
to
her
it
was
so
long
oh
so
long
since
chris
and
uncle
john
had
done
that
and
yet
the
irony
of
it
there
was
roddy
eager
to
do
it
all
and
from
him
the
fates
had
decreed
that
it
should
mean
nothing
to
her
why
ca
he
touch
me
why
ca
he
give
me
what
i
want
is
it
my
fault
whose
fault
is
it
and
when
she
came
to
uncle
john
she
was
almost
afraid
to
look
at
him
lest
he
should
see
the
unhappiness
in
her
eyes
but
in
spite
of
her
unhappiness
she
could
be
satirically
observant
her
grandmother
up
there
on
the
wall
controlled
like
the
moon
this
tide
of
human
beings
they
flowed
forward
they
retreated
about
them
around
them
behind
and
in
front
of
them
hovered
this
war
rachel
knew
that
it
was
the
beaminster
doctrine
that
anything
that
occurred
to
the
nation
was
to
be
attributed
in
the
main
to
beaminster
principles
she
could
tell
at
once
that
they
had
seized
upon
this
war
as
an
example
of
beaminster
government
had
diplomacy
prevented
it
behold
the
triumph
of
beaminster
diplomacy
now
as
it
had
not
been
prevented
a
swift
and
total
triumph
would
assert
the
genius
of
beaminster
militancy
a
week
out
there
ought
to
be
enough
it
tiresome
of
course
but
they
soon
have
had
enough
of
it
even
rachel
looking
up
at
the
portrait
might
not
too
fantastically
imagine
that
this
war
presented
the
last
great
manifestation
of
power
on
the
part
of
that
old
woman
everyone
in
the
room
perhaps
felt
the
same
ii
many
eyes
were
upon
her
as
she
moved
across
to
lord
john
this
girl
with
the
foreign
colour
and
bearing
having
apparently
so
little
of
the
beaminster
about
her
and
making
so
quickly
so
conventional
a
marriage
one
had
expected
her
to
care
about
a
man
like
seddon
stirred
their
curiosity
monty
carfax
licensed
transmitter
of
public
opinion
reported
her
unpopular
met
her
one
at
the
massiters
that
very
time
when
seddon
proposed
did
like
her
and
really
ca
find
anyone
who
does
conceited
farouche
it
my
opinion
roddy
seddon
finds
her
difficult
yes
but
she
interesting
someone
would
reply
unusual
not
at
all
happy
i
should
say
lady
adela
stiff
awkward
but
important
in
an
ugly
grey
dress
found
lord
crewner
the
only
helpful
person
in
the
room
he
seemed
to
understand
the
way
that
worries
accumulated
about
one
and
yet
refused
to
be
defined
he
stayed
near
her
throughout
the
afternoon
she
saw
rachel
moving
across
to
her
brother
and
the
sight
of
her
stirred
all
her
discomfort
why
need
she
look
as
though
she
hated
everyone
she
thought
rachel
came
at
length
to
uncle
john
and
found
him
talking
to
maurice
garden
that
large
and
prosperous
gentleman
hastily
proclaimed
his
delight
in
meeting
rachel
again
but
she
had
very
little
to
say
to
him
he
left
them
secretly
determined
that
he
would
never
speak
to
the
girl
again
if
he
could
help
it
uncle
john
regarded
her
with
an
air
of
supplicating
nervousness
come
along
my
dear
he
said
we
have
had
a
talk
for
weeks
find
a
corner
somewhere
they
found
a
corner
and
then
were
both
of
them
uncomfortable
the
girl
whom
uncle
john
had
known
and
loved
had
had
her
tempers
and
intolerances
but
she
had
also
had
her
wonderful
spontaneous
affections
and
tendernesses
now
she
sat
there
looking
straight
before
her
and
replying
only
in
monosyllables
to
his
questions
she
was
saying
to
herself
shall
i
go
shall
i
go
at
last
he
said
timidly
you
see
mother
before
you
leave
yes
rachel
said
i
afraid
she
not
very
well
not
very
well
rachel
looked
up
at
him
sharply
lord
john
stared
away
from
her
no
one
had
ever
said
that
publicly
before
lord
john
himself
wondered
at
his
words
when
he
had
spoken
them
of
course
she
does
admit
it
he
said
hurriedly
no
one
anything
about
it
even
christopher
i
ought
perhaps
to
have
said
anything
myself
but
i
thought
he
broke
off
rachel
knew
that
he
meant
that
she
should
be
kind
and
considerate
on
this
visit
before
she
could
say
anything
the
duke
came
up
and
joined
them
it
always
amused
rachel
to
see
her
two
uncles
together
the
duke
was
a
little
wasp
of
a
man
absolutely
selfish
with
a
satirical
tongue
and
a
that
nothing
could
pierce
he
wore
high
white
collars
over
which
his
brown
sharp
face
searched
for
compliments
he
walked
on
his
toes
his
hands
were
most
wonderfully
manicured
and
his
trousers
were
so
stiff
and
rigid
over
his
thin
little
legs
that
they
looked
like
iron
the
one
soft
spot
in
him
was
a
strangely
tender
affection
for
his
sister
adela
which
was
in
no
way
returned
for
her
and
for
her
alone
he
would
forget
his
selfishness
richard
and
john
he
despised
well
john
he
said
well
rachel
well
uncle
vincent
she
said
the
duke
was
afraid
of
rachel
because
her
tongue
was
as
sharp
as
his
but
he
respected
her
for
that
going
up
to
see
mother
yes
said
rachel
should
she
go
should
she
go
suddenly
arising
as
it
seemed
out
of
that
crowd
of
moving
figures
and
coming
and
standing
there
in
front
of
her
was
her
answer
yes
she
would
go
all
these
months
of
indetermination
should
be
ended
she
should
know
once
and
for
all
what
this
francis
breton
meant
to
her
what
that
other
life
of
hers
meant
to
her
and
so
in
opposition
what
roddy
meant
to
her
she
would
as
christopher
would
have
put
it
grapple
with
her
tiger
instantly
the
relief
the
glad
happy
relief
showed
her
how
wretched
life
had
been
what
about
this
war
uncle
vincent
she
said
well
hem
well
no
need
to
worry
assure
you
no
need
to
worry
it
seems
a
pity
said
lord
john
still
looking
furtively
at
rachel
and
wishing
that
he
could
carry
her
off
into
some
other
corner
and
just
ask
her
whether
she
were
really
happy
or
no
why
john
said
the
duke
cackling
you
have
to
go
out
my
word
you
will
fight
by
jove
ha
ha
you
make
a
fine
soldier
old
boy
rachel
got
up
hating
uncle
vincent
very
much
she
put
her
hand
on
uncle
john
fat
arm
you
may
go
uncle
vincent
she
said
we
all
give
you
leave
uncle
john
we
love
too
much
if
it
a
question
of
bravery
he
be
quite
certainly
the
first
of
this
family
she
gave
his
arm
a
squeeze
uncle
vincent
looked
at
her
smiling
well
he
said
none
of
us
would
dream
of
going
we
all
much
too
comfortable
i
see
you
before
i
go
uncle
dear
she
whispered
to
lord
john
then
she
moved
away
slowly
making
her
path
through
the
room
she
left
it
and
climbed
the
great
stone
staircase
iii
outside
her
grandmother
door
she
paused
so
she
had
always
paused
and
now
as
she
waited
there
all
the
procession
of
other
days
when
she
had
stood
there
came
before
her
conditions
might
be
changed
but
her
agitation
was
the
same
never
until
she
died
would
she
open
that
door
without
wondering
in
spite
of
common
sense
whether
she
might
not
be
caught
by
some
disaster
before
she
closed
it
again
she
went
in
and
found
her
grandmother
sitting
back
in
her
stiff
chair
and
looking
at
some
patterns
of
bright
silks
that
lay
on
a
little
table
beside
her
a
great
fire
was
burning
and
the
room
seemed
to
rachel
intolerably
hot
she
noticed
at
once
that
what
uncle
john
had
said
was
true
before
she
had
heard
rachel
entrance
the
duchess
looked
an
old
tired
woman
her
head
was
drooping
a
little
over
the
blue
and
purple
silks
she
seemed
half
asleep
but
at
the
sound
of
the
door
she
was
alert
when
she
saw
that
it
was
her
granddaughter
who
stood
there
tall
and
stately
her
large
black
hat
shadowing
her
face
she
seemed
in
a
moment
to
be
transformed
with
energy
and
life
her
head
went
up
her
eyes
flashed
her
hands
stiffened
on
her
lap
may
i
come
in
for
a
moment
grandmother
rachel
said
by
the
door
she
had
wondered
how
could
she
be
afraid
of
this
old
sick
woman
now
as
she
crossed
over
to
the
fire
her
sternest
was
summoned
to
control
her
alarm
she
was
frightened
by
nothing
but
this
here
it
was
indeed
as
though
there
were
some
spell
that
seized
her
certainly
my
dear
come
in
the
duchess
gave
a
last
look
at
the
silks
and
then
turned
to
her
granddaughter
i
afraid
you
find
it
very
hot
i
must
have
a
fire
you
know
she
had
a
trick
of
drawing
in
her
lower
lip
as
she
spoke
so
that
her
words
hissed
a
little
over
her
teeth
she
did
not
do
this
with
everybody
and
rachel
believed
that
it
was
only
because
she
had
noticed
that
rachel
as
a
little
girl
had
been
frightened
of
it
that
she
did
it
now
rachel
sat
down
opposite
her
and
the
heat
of
the
fire
and
a
scent
of
something
that
had
violets
and
mignonette
in
it
a
scent
that
was
always
in
the
room
stifled
her
so
that
her
head
began
to
swim
and
the
rings
on
the
duchess
hand
to
hypnotize
her
there
a
great
party
going
on
downstairs
she
said
yes
i
know
john
came
up
for
a
moment
and
told
me
about
it
and
how
are
you
very
well
thank
you
grandmamma
roddy
and
i
have
been
ever
so
sociable
lately
given
several
and
one
musical
thing
you
not
looking
very
well
roddy
here
yes
hope
he
come
and
see
me
before
he
goes
has
been
to
see
me
much
lately
their
eyes
met
rachel
held
her
ground
and
then
beaten
as
though
by
a
physical
blow
lowered
her
gaze
oh
has
he
he
been
here
a
lot
i
thought
he
been
very
busy
over
some
horses
that
he
had
to
go
up
and
down
to
seddon
about
h
well
i
dare
say
he
remember
me
again
one
day
so
we
in
for
a
war
yes
they
do
seem
to
think
it
very
serious
though
uncle
richard
says
your
uncle
richard
knows
nothing
about
it
nothing
however
i
think
anyone
need
be
alarmed
there
was
in
this
last
sentence
a
ring
in
the
duchess
voice
that
flung
her
words
out
for
the
nation
to
grasp
at
no
need
my
good
people
for
you
to
worry
have
this
in
hand
well
i
very
glad
said
rachel
it
such
a
long
while
since
anything
has
happened
that
it
seems
quite
odd
for
everyone
to
have
something
to
talk
about
except
and
scandal
the
old
woman
looked
across
at
her
and
then
very
slowly
a
smile
rose
stiffened
between
her
old
dried
lips
and
stayed
there
what
would
you
say
my
dear
if
roddy
thought
it
his
duty
to
go
and
defend
his
country
there
was
suddenly
the
sharp
ring
in
her
voice
that
rachel
knew
so
well
i
know
rachel
said
quietly
that
roddy
would
do
his
duty
and
of
course
i
would
want
him
to
do
that
the
duchess
with
her
eyes
still
upon
her
granddaughter
face
said
i
heard
a
good
deal
about
a
young
friend
of
yours
lately
who
is
that
grandmamma
rachel
said
and
in
spite
of
herself
her
hand
trembled
a
little
against
her
dress
nita
raseley
rachel
caught
her
breath
i
gather
that
you
and
she
have
seen
so
much
of
one
another
lately
oh
i
think
we
have
we
never
were
great
friends
you
know
did
she
enjoy
her
time
at
seddon
a
clever
little
thing
i
drop
her
rachel
if
i
were
you
she
seemed
to
enjoy
seddon
grandmamma
i
must
be
going
i
afraid
with
the
patient
roddy
waiting
for
me
shall
i
tell
him
to
come
up
the
old
hand
struck
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
the
rings
flashed
no
thank
you
my
dear
if
he
ca
come
of
his
own
accord
i
prefer
that
he
had
no
prompting
there
was
a
time
when
it
was
otherwise
rachel
got
up
their
eyes
met
again
and
their
hatred
for
one
another
was
so
settled
so
historic
so
traditional
an
affair
that
their
glance
now
was
almost
friendly
then
rachel
bent
down
very
slowly
and
kissed
her
grandmother
cheek
how
much
she
wondered
did
she
know
of
the
nita
affair
nita
spite
would
assuredly
have
found
a
happy
ground
in
which
to
plant
its
seed
oh
how
she
loathed
this
thick
clouded
atmosphere
this
deceit
this
deceit
it
seemed
that
at
every
turn
since
her
marriage
she
had
been
dragged
into
an
atmosphere
of
disguise
and
subterfuge
and
well
she
was
soon
to
be
done
with
it
at
the
thought
of
what
her
grandmother
would
say
did
she
know
of
her
friendship
with
breton
her
heart
beat
triumphantly
there
at
any
rate
was
a
weapon
well
my
dear
come
and
see
me
again
soon
yes
grandmamma
iv
in
the
carriage
with
roddy
she
suddenly
laughed
all
those
people
moving
so
solemnly
with
such
about
that
room
the
duke
lord
richard
aunt
adela
norris
the
footman
over
them
all
that
fierce
commanding
portrait
and
upstairs
that
old
sick
woman
and
beyond
away
from
that
house
a
war
that
that
old
woman
and
those
people
saw
only
as
a
means
of
increasing
their
own
it
was
all
as
a
box
of
tin
soldiers
and
a
parcel
of
stiff
dolls
what
were
they
all
about
what
did
they
think
they
were
all
doing
what
after
all
was
she
rachel
had
they
no
conception
of
the
sawdust
that
they
all
were
beside
this
real
swiftly
moving
war
that
was
suddenly
amongst
them
what
is
it
said
roddy
grandmother
grandmother
my
dear
delightful
wonderful
grandmother
to
think
of
her
sitting
all
alone
up
there
in
her
bedroom
and
all
those
people
moving
about
downstairs
all
so
conscious
of
her
and
yet
she
does
nothing
rachel
in
her
excitement
struck
her
knee
with
her
hand
she
is
even
clever
really
she
never
in
all
her
life
been
known
to
say
a
witty
thing
never
she
does
really
know
much
about
politics
she
just
sits
there
and
acts
that
what
always
been
acting
the
whole
time
if
it
effective
to
be
old
and
feeble
she
old
and
feeble
if
it
effective
to
be
fantastic
she
fantastic
she
just
sits
still
and
takes
people
in
why
if
wanted
she
could
have
been
going
out
all
these
thirty
years
i
believe
you
always
unfair
to
her
rachel
said
roddy
you
know
she
has
ghastly
pain
often
and
often
yes
i
give
her
that
said
rachel
she
brave
brave
as
anything
and
after
all
she
added
she
could
affect
me
more
if
she
were
the
wittiest
woman
in
the
world
roddy
yawned
dam
dull
party
he
said
chapter
vii
rachel
and
breton
we
are
the
pilgrims
master
we
shall
go
always
a
little
farther
it
may
be
beyond
that
last
blue
mountain
barred
with
snow
across
that
angry
or
that
glimmering
sea
but
surely
we
are
brave
who
make
the
golden
journey
to
samarcand
golden
journey
to
james
alroy
flecker
i
rachel
now
awaited
her
meeting
with
breton
with
restless
impatience
it
should
afford
her
beyond
everything
a
solution
she
was
young
enough
and
inexperienced
enough
to
make
many
demands
upon
life
that
it
should
be
romantic
that
it
should
in
the
issues
that
it
presented
be
honest
and
open
and
clear
that
it
should
allow
her
to
settle
her
own
place
in
it
without
any
hurt
to
anyone
else
that
it
should
in
fact
arrange
any
number
of
compromises
to
suit
herself
and
that
it
should
nevertheless
be
so
honest
that
it
would
admit
of
no
compromises
at
all
she
approached
life
with
all
the
reckless
boldness
of
one
who
has
never
come
into
direct
contact
with
it
neither
her
relations
with
her
grandmother
nor
with
roddy
had
as
yet
taken
from
her
any
of
her
youngest
nor
simplest
illusions
were
life
drab
and
uninteresting
why
then
one
turned
simply
to
the
place
where
it
promised
colour
and
adventure
she
had
not
yet
discovered
that
when
we
go
deliberately
to
grasp
at
happiness
we
are
eternally
eluded
but
in
spite
of
her
desire
for
honesty
she
refused
to
face
the
actual
meeting
with
breton
she
knew
him
so
slightly
as
francis
breton
and
so
intimately
as
an
idea
what
she
felt
in
her
heart
was
that
her
grandmother
had
hoped
to
catch
her
by
marrying
her
to
roddy
and
that
nothing
could
prove
so
eloquently
that
she
had
not
been
caught
as
her
friendship
with
breton
i
will
show
her
and
i
will
show
roddy
that
i
am
my
own
mistress
free
whatever
they
may
say
or
do
breton
seen
dimly
as
a
rebel
against
a
harsh
dominating
world
was
the
figure
of
all
romance
and
freedom
roddy
does
care
what
happens
to
me
he
do
anything
grandmother
tells
him
to
she
was
now
out
to
attack
the
beaminster
fortress
she
did
not
as
yet
know
that
half
of
her
was
urgent
for
its
defence
ii
when
the
afternoon
arrived
she
took
a
cab
and
was
driven
to
saxton
square
she
mounted
the
stairs
knocked
on
the
door
and
was
admitted
by
his
ugly
is
breton
at
home
she
asked
yes
my
lady
he
answered
and
smiled
she
disliked
his
smile
and
before
she
passed
into
the
room
had
a
moment
of
wild
unreasoning
panic
when
she
wished
that
she
were
not
there
when
roddy
face
came
to
her
kind
and
loving
and
homely
she
stepped
forward
into
the
room
heard
the
door
close
behind
her
and
felt
rather
than
saw
him
as
he
came
forward
to
greet
her
then
she
heard
him
say
oh
i
so
glad
you
come
i
was
so
afraid
lest
something
should
stop
you
his
windows
although
only
on
the
first
floor
had
a
wide
sweeping
view
a
world
of
chimneys
and
towers
glittering
now
beneath
the
sinking
sun
his
room
was
simple
and
had
the
effect
of
cleanly
emptiness
a
table
arranged
for
tea
two
rather
faded
a
dark
green
carpet
a
two
large
framed
photographs
on
the
walls
one
of
some
street
in
bombay
the
other
of
the
niagara
falls
the
sunshine
lit
the
bare
room
and
their
faces
and
she
was
suddenly
comfortable
and
at
ease
he
drew
one
of
the
easy
chairs
forward
to
the
window
sit
down
in
the
sun
marks
will
bring
the
tea
in
a
moment
she
sat
back
in
the
chair
and
looked
out
on
to
the
shining
roofs
and
towers
not
glancing
towards
him
but
acutely
aware
of
him
of
all
his
movements
he
sat
down
upon
the
broad
near
her
and
looked
at
her
she
knew
that
she
had
never
been
conscious
physically
of
anyone
before
roddy
clumsy
hands
and
rather
awkward
body
had
always
simply
belonged
to
roddy
and
stayed
at
that
now
she
felt
as
if
francis
breton
hand
close
as
she
knew
to
hers
was
joined
to
her
by
a
running
current
of
attraction
although
he
was
not
touching
her
it
was
as
though
she
were
chained
to
him
if
he
moved
she
felt
that
she
must
move
with
him
and
every
motion
that
he
made
seemed
to
rouse
some
response
in
her
she
was
aware
of
course
as
she
was
always
aware
with
him
of
the
way
that
intimacy
between
them
had
moved
since
their
last
meeting
all
her
romantic
evocation
of
life
as
she
wanted
it
to
be
helped
her
to
this
it
was
as
though
she
said
to
herself
here
at
least
is
my
true
self
free
and
dominant
i
must
make
the
most
of
it
and
yet
with
that
something
seemed
to
warn
her
that
freedom
too
easily
obtained
carried
at
its
heart
disappointment
the
ugly
brought
in
tea
and
then
disappeared
breton
moved
about
waited
upon
her
then
sat
down
closer
to
her
leaning
forward
and
looking
into
her
eyes
it
was
part
of
his
temperament
that
he
should
take
her
coming
to
him
as
an
instant
acknowledgment
of
the
complete
fulfilment
of
his
wishes
he
always
saw
life
as
the
very
rosiest
of
his
dreams
until
it
woke
him
to
reality
he
was
ruled
completely
by
the
mood
of
the
moment
and
his
one
emotion
now
was
that
rachel
was
divinely
intended
for
him
alone
of
all
human
beings
but
he
could
not
wait
he
knew
by
this
time
that
reflection
was
always
a
period
of
disappointment
he
was
unhappily
made
in
that
he
yielded
to
his
impulses
of
regret
as
eagerly
as
to
his
impulses
of
anticipation
one
mood
followed
so
swiftly
upon
another
that
collision
might
seem
inevitable
they
were
both
of
them
young
enough
to
see
life
as
something
that
would
inevitably
in
a
short
time
condemn
them
both
to
years
of
sterile
monotony
rachel
indeed
felt
that
she
was
already
caught
they
must
both
of
them
therefore
make
the
best
of
their
time
i
so
afraid
he
repeated
again
lest
something
should
have
stopped
you
i
would
have
asked
you
to
come
to
us
only
i
afraid
that
my
husband
still
oh
i
quite
understand
it
natural
roddy
like
that
if
he
wants
to
do
a
thing
he
care
for
anybody
and
just
does
it
but
if
nothing
makes
him
especially
want
to
do
it
then
he
just
takes
other
people
opinions
now
he
might
ask
you
suddenly
to
come
and
see
us
simply
because
he
took
it
into
his
head
then
nobody
could
stop
him
he
very
obstinate
she
was
rather
surprised
at
herself
for
talking
about
roddy
she
had
a
curious
feeling
about
him
as
though
she
were
going
on
a
journey
and
had
just
said
to
him
and
had
a
rather
desolate
choke
in
her
throat
because
she
would
see
him
again
for
so
long
oh
but
i
glad
you
come
if
you
knew
the
times
and
times
when
imagined
this
meeting
thought
about
it
pictured
she
saw
that
his
hand
was
trembling
on
the
i
ought
to
have
come
perhaps
but
i
do
know
i
felt
so
indignant
at
the
way
that
grandmother
is
treating
you
i
wanted
to
you
that
i
was
indignant
you
do
know
he
said
what
a
help
you
been
to
me
already
you
showed
me
the
very
first
time
that
we
met
that
you
sympathize
his
voice
was
tender
partly
because
her
presence
moved
him
so
deeply
and
partly
because
the
sympathy
of
anyone
about
his
own
affairs
made
him
instantly
full
of
sorrow
for
himself
when
anyone
said
that
they
thought
that
he
had
been
badly
treated
he
always
felt
with
an
air
of
surprised
discovery
by
jove
i
been
having
a
bad
time
yes
was
it
strange
that
first
meeting
in
miss
rand
room
we
seem
to
have
known
one
another
all
our
lives
she
looked
at
him
that
you
should
hate
grandmamma
so
she
said
was
a
great
thing
to
me
i
been
all
alone
fighting
her
for
so
long
rachel
felt
in
the
glow
of
the
occasion
that
all
her
days
there
had
been
active
constant
in
the
portland
place
house
she
been
the
curse
of
my
life
he
said
bitterly
always
keeping
me
down
making
me
unable
to
do
myself
justice
why
should
she
hate
me
so
she
hates
us
cried
rachel
because
we
both
determined
to
be
free
we
would
have
our
lives
ruled
for
us
she
wants
everyone
to
be
under
her
in
they
glowed
together
very
close
to
one
another
now
in
a
glorious
assertion
of
rebellious
independence
he
put
his
hand
upon
the
back
of
her
chair
now
he
said
his
voice
trembling
now
that
we
got
to
know
one
another
you
wo
go
back
on
it
will
you
if
i
could
feel
that
you
were
behind
me
after
being
so
encouraged
it
would
be
terrible
for
me
worse
than
anything
ever
been
for
me
you
need
be
afraid
she
said
not
looking
at
him
but
tremendously
conscious
of
his
hand
that
now
touched
her
dress
then
there
was
a
long
and
very
difficult
silence
during
which
events
seemed
to
move
with
terrific
impetus
she
was
overwhelmed
by
a
multitude
of
emotions
she
was
past
analysis
of
regret
or
anticipation
somewhere
very
far
away
there
was
roddy
and
somewhere
also
very
far
away
there
was
her
grandmother
but
for
herself
she
could
only
feel
that
she
was
very
lonely
that
nobody
cared
about
her
except
breton
and
that
nobody
cared
about
him
except
herself
and
that
she
wanted
urgently
to
be
comforted
and
that
he
himself
needed
comfort
from
her
she
knew
that
if
she
were
not
very
and
resolute
she
would
cry
she
could
feel
the
tears
burning
her
eyes
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
come
oh
it
all
so
difficult
with
grandmother
and
everything
i
thought
i
could
could
manage
things
but
i
ca
we
ought
i
wanted
to
do
what
was
best
i
i
know
you
then
the
tears
came
she
tried
desperately
to
stop
them
then
they
came
rushing
she
buried
her
head
in
her
hands
and
abandoned
herself
to
weeping
that
was
partly
sorrow
for
herself
and
partly
sorrow
for
breton
and
partly
in
the
strangest
way
sorrow
for
roddy
he
was
on
his
knees
by
her
chair
had
his
arm
about
her
was
crying
oh
rachel
rachel
rachel
i
love
you
i
love
you
cry
do
rachel
he
kissed
her
again
and
again
and
she
clung
to
him
like
a
frightened
child
iii
after
a
time
her
crying
ceased
she
got
up
from
the
chair
moving
gently
out
of
his
embrace
and
then
went
to
the
above
the
fireplace
and
stood
there
wiping
her
eyes
then
smiling
she
looked
back
at
him
he
was
standing
in
front
of
the
window
and
behind
him
the
reflection
from
the
departed
sun
flooded
the
town
with
gold
he
seemed
a
man
transformed
gazing
upon
her
with
an
ecstasy
of
triumph
exaltation
happiness
my
dear
my
dear
oh
how
glorious
you
are
but
she
did
not
move
he
stirred
impatiently
and
then
looking
at
her
with
adoring
eyes
he
whispered
oh
my
dear
but
i
love
you
i
must
go
she
said
her
eyes
large
and
frightened
appealingly
upon
him
he
smiled
at
her
his
eyes
laughing
yes
francis
let
me
let
me
now
while
i
can
still
see
what
i
ought
to
do
there
only
one
thing
that
you
ought
to
do
you
belong
to
me
now
she
plucked
nervously
with
her
hands
one
against
the
other
francis
let
me
go
please
please
he
saw
then
that
she
was
unhappy
and
the
laughter
died
from
his
eyes
his
voice
fallen
from
its
happiness
was
almost
harsh
as
he
replied
you
know
we
love
one
another
have
loved
one
another
ever
since
that
day
when
we
met
in
miss
rand
rooms
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
you
knew
it
when
you
came
to
these
rooms
i
ought
to
have
come
her
voice
had
gathered
strength
it
only
because
i
realize
now
what
you
are
to
me
that
i
want
to
go
i
thought
i
was
so
strong
that
i
could
be
fair
to
roddy
and
to
you
too
i
know
then
stay
stay
he
whispered
urgently
it
a
thing
that
you
got
to
face
anyhow
we
ca
stay
apart
you
and
i
now
we
can
try
but
you
know
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
we
ca
do
it
we
must
that
what
i
meant
before
that
why
i
must
go
now
because
soon
i
sha
be
strong
enough
but
we
got
to
part
we
got
to
oh
this
is
absurd
he
cried
we
human
beings
not
figures
to
hang
a
theory
on
now
just
as
we
realize
what
we
are
to
one
another
yes
because
of
that
she
broke
in
swiftly
urgently
you
know
that
i
love
you
i
know
that
you
love
me
we
got
that
knowledge
that
nothing
can
take
away
from
us
and
we
got
the
love
nothing
can
touch
it
but
my
duty
is
with
roddy
you
knew
that
he
said
when
you
came
here
her
face
flamed
that
not
fair
of
you
francis
no
i
beg
your
pardon
it
is
he
suddenly
came
to
her
caught
her
and
kissed
her
holding
her
with
his
arm
close
to
him
murmuring
in
her
ear
at
first
she
had
struggled
then
she
lay
absolutely
still
against
him
making
no
response
he
felt
her
passive
against
his
beating
heart
he
released
her
and
watched
her
as
she
went
across
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
darkening
city
i
do
care
he
said
roughly
i
love
you
there
no
talk
about
it
or
anything
else
you
belong
to
i
belong
to
roddy
she
answered
quietly
it
all
quite
clear
my
duty
is
to
him
until
unless
life
with
him
becomes
impossible
got
absolutely
to
do
my
best
and
while
i
doing
that
you
got
to
help
me
what
do
you
mean
he
said
his
eyes
upon
her
help
me
by
our
not
meeting
by
our
not
writing
by
our
doing
nothing
nothing
no
no
he
answered
her
his
eyes
set
upon
her
you
do
get
me
any
other
way
francis
do
you
see
that
we
not
the
sort
of
people
either
of
us
to
put
up
with
the
deceits
the
trickeries
the
lies
that
the
other
thing
means
some
people
might
lots
of
people
do
i
suppose
but
we
not
built
that
way
idealists
we
are
made
to
stand
quietly
and
see
all
the
quality
of
the
thing
vanish
before
our
eyes
just
to
take
the
husk
when
we
known
what
the
kernel
was
like
besides
it
is
as
though
i
hated
roddy
if
i
did
i
go
off
with
you
now
in
a
minute
if
you
wanted
me
although
even
then
it
would
be
a
hopeless
thing
for
to
do
but
i
very
fond
of
roddy
i
not
in
love
with
him
i
never
have
been
i
told
him
from
the
first
but
going
to
do
my
best
by
him
why
did
you
come
here
i
came
here
because
i
was
driven
towards
you
i
wanted
to
hear
you
say
that
you
loved
me
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
loved
you
we
both
of
us
said
it
we
know
it
now
and
we
got
to
keep
it
the
most
precious
thing
in
the
world
but
we
should
soon
hate
one
another
if
we
destroyed
one
ideals
for
many
people
it
would
matter
for
us
weak
as
we
are
it
matters
everything
all
this
talk
he
said
i
a
man
i
here
to
love
you
not
to
talk
about
it
i
got
you
and
i
going
to
keep
you
you
have
got
me
she
cried
you
got
a
bit
of
me
there
be
times
when
i
away
from
you
when
i
shall
think
that
you
got
all
of
me
but
you
have
no
one
got
all
of
me
and
i
have
got
you
either
you
think
now
for
the
moment
that
it
is
so
but
i
know
what
it
would
be
if
we
were
hiding
about
on
the
continent
or
secretly
meeting
here
in
london
that
not
for
us
francis
i
got
you
he
repeated
i
not
going
to
wait
any
longer
it
the
only
way
you
ever
have
me
she
answered
by
letting
me
do
my
duty
to
roddy
i
promise
you
that
if
ever
life
is
impossible
if
it
ever
better
for
both
of
us
that
i
should
go
i
come
to
you
but
i
shall
tell
him
first
tell
him
but
he
wo
let
you
go
he
wo
stop
me
if
it
comes
to
that
he
pleaded
with
her
then
telling
her
about
his
life
its
loneliness
his
unhappiness
how
impossible
it
would
be
now
without
her
but
she
shook
her
head
do
you
think
she
cried
that
grandmother
would
be
delighted
if
we
went
off
both
of
us
done
for
you
never
able
to
return
again
ah
no
for
all
of
us
for
every
reason
it
not
to
be
i
wo
let
you
go
i
got
you
i
keep
you
you
ca
francis
i
can
and
i
will
then
looking
up
catching
a
vision
of
her
framed
in
the
window
with
the
lighted
city
behind
her
he
saw
in
her
eyes
how
unattainable
she
might
be
he
had
he
had
always
had
his
ideals
there
was
a
long
silence
between
them
then
he
bowed
his
head
you
shall
do
as
you
will
anything
with
me
that
you
will
oh
my
dear
she
whispered
i
love
you
for
that
then
hurriedly
moving
as
though
she
feared
her
own
weakness
she
went
to
put
on
her
wraps
he
came
to
her
let
me
write
let
me
no
better
not
just
a
line
nothing
that
any
ordinary
person
no
we
must
francis
he
put
her
furs
about
her
neck
then
his
hand
rested
on
her
shoulder
her
head
fell
back
once
more
she
said
he
kissed
her
throat
then
her
eyes
then
their
lips
met
stay
he
whispered
stay
very
slowly
she
drew
away
from
him
smiled
at
him
once
and
was
gone

to

that

henry

i
the
war
had
the
city
in
its
grip
there
was
now
during
these
early
weeks
of
november
no
other
thought
no
other
anxiety
no
other
interest
the
shock
of
its
reality
came
most
severely
upon
those
whose
lives
had
been
most
unreal
here
in
the
midst
of
their
dining
and
their
dancing
was
the
sure
fact
that
many
whom
they
knew
and
with
whom
they
had
been
in
the
habit
of
playing
might
now
at
any
moment
find
death
here
was
a
reality
against
which
there
was
no
argument
and
against
the
harshness
of
it
music
screamed
and
food
was
uninteresting
during
that
first
month
of
that
war
so
new
a
thing
was
the
horrid
grimness
of
it
that
hysteria
was
abroad
life
was
twopence
coloured
for
everyone
now
it
was
the
question
what
might
they
do
something
to
help
something
to
ease
that
biting
truth
your
life
has
been
the
most
utterly
useless
business
no
purpose
no
strength
no
unselfishness
from
first
to
last
what
now
christopher
life
had
not
been
useless
and
he
knew
it
the
reality
of
it
had
never
been
in
doubt
and
death
the
haphazard
surprise
of
it
and
the
pathos
and
melodrama
and
sometimes
drab
monotony
of
it
had
been
his
companion
for
many
years
christopher
although
he
had
been
a
hard
worker
from
his
childhood
had
always
taken
life
lightly
he
loved
the
gifts
of
this
world
food
and
amusement
and
exercise
and
pleasant
company
he
loved
also
certain
people
whose
lives
were
of
immense
concern
to
him
he
also
believed
in
a
quite
traditional
god
about
whom
he
had
never
argued
but
whose
definite
particular
existence
was
as
certain
to
him
as
his
own
he
had
faults
that
he
tried
to
cure
his
temper
his
pleasure
in
food
and
wine
he
had
three
great
motives
in
his
life
his
love
of
god
his
love
of
his
friends
and
his
love
of
his
work
he
hated
hypocrites
mean
persons
cruel
persons
anyone
who
showed
cowardice
or
deceit
or
arrogance
he
was
dogmatic
and
therefore
disliked
anyone
else
to
be
so
he
was
humble
about
his
work
but
not
humble
about
his
position
in
the
world
which
he
thought
quite
frankly
a
very
good
one
his
interest
in
his
especial
friends
was
compounded
of
his
love
for
them
and
also
of
his
curiosity
about
them
and
he
always
loved
someone
the
more
if
he
or
she
gave
him
the
opportunity
to
practise
his
inquisitiveness
upon
them

he
cared
more
perhaps
for
francis
breton
than
anyone
in
the
world
he
had
also
of
late
been
interested
in
roddy
who
was
a
far
better
fellow
than
he
had
expected
one
puzzle
meanwhile
obstinately
and
continually
beset
him
what
had
happened
to
breton
during
this
last
year
something
or
in
surer
probability
someone
had
been
behind
him
christopher
might
have
flattered
himself
that
he
had
been
the
influence
but
he
knew
that
if
that
had
been
so
breton
attitude
to
him
would
have
implied
it
breton
was
fond
of
him
but
did
not
owe
that
to
him
who
then
was
it
on
one
of
these
november
days
he
invited
a
friend
and
breton
to
luncheon
together
christopher
geniality
and
the
supreme
importance
of
the
war
over
everything
else
helped
amiability
christopher
little
house
in
harley
street
showed
beyond
its
a
cheerful
philistine
appreciation
of
comfort
and
love
there
was
old
silver
there
were
old
prints
sofas
soft
carpets
whose
glass
coverings
were
more
important
than
their
contents
also
a
luncheon
that
was
the
most
artistic
thing
that
the
house
contained
save
only
the
wine
at
the
side
of
the
round
gleaming
table
christopher
sat
smiling
and
soon
breton
told
the
friend
about
india
and
the
friend
told
breton
about
africa
meanwhile
christopher
watched
breton
he
knew
breton
very
well
and
in
the
old
days
he
would
have
said
that
that
nervous
excitement
that
the
man
sometimes
betrayed
meant
that
he
was
on
the
edge
of
some
most
foolish
action
he
knew
that
light
in
the
eyes
that
excited
voice
that
restlessness
these
things
had
meant
that
breton
was
about
to
break
there
were
all
these
signs
and
christopher
knew
that
after
luncheon
breton
would
escape
him
breton
did
escape
him
went
off
somewhere
in
a
hurry
no
christopher
could
not
drive
him
he
was
going
in
the
opposite
direction
whilst
christopher
drove
first
down
to
eaton
square
then
back
to
portland
place
he
was
wondering
about
breton
ii
it
seemed
that
on
this
afternoon
he
was
unduly
sensitive
to
impression
the
house
struck
him
with
a
chill
deserted
air
there
seemed
to
be
no
one
about
as
norris
led
him
up
to
the
duchess
rooms
the
old
portraits
grinned
at
him
as
though
they
would
have
him
to
know
that
very
soon
the
house
would
be
once
more
in
their
possession
and
beaminsters
dead
and
gone
be
of
more
importance
than
beaminsters
alive
at
any
rate
it
was
a
cold
november
day
and
always
now
the
streets
seemed
to
echo
with
newsboys
crying
out
editions
even
through
these
stone
walls
those
cries
could
penetrate
he
could
hear
one
as
he
climbed
the
stairs
the
duchess
looking
peaked
and
shrivelled
received
him
with
an
eagerness
that
showed
that
she
was
longing
for
company
the
room
was
close
but
in
spite
of
that
now
and
again
she
shivered
a
little
as
he
sat
opposite
her
the
glance
that
she
flung
him
was
almost
pathetic
struggling
to
maintain
her
pride
but
showing
too
that
she
might
now
in
his
company
a
little
relax
that
great
effort
i
not
so
well
she
said
i
slept
badly
i
sorry
for
that
he
said
what
the
trouble
it
this
war
she
said
taking
her
eyes
away
from
his
face
this
war
i
do
think
i
ever
felt
anything
before
but
this
oh
old
old
at
last
she
said
almost
savagely
everybody
feeling
it
just
now
christopher
answered
her
quietly
i
suppose
i
as
as
most
people
but
even
i
have
been
imagining
things
nerves
simply
nerves
nonsense
she
answered
him
do
tell
christopher
what
have
i
ever
had
to
do
with
nerves
wait
a
little
all
we
want
is
to
get
used
to
war
it
a
new
experience
for
all
of
us
she
laughed
sharply
it
ludicrous
but
really
you
think
if
you
studied
my
family
that
i
was
responsible
for
the
whole
thing
it
positively
as
though
i
made
some
huge
blunder
which
they
would
do
their
best
to
excuse
adela
john
i
now
to
them
an
old
sick
woman
who
got
to
be
kept
quiet
and
away
from
worry
they
would
have
let
me
see
that
six
months
ago
her
voice
was
trembling
she
went
on
again
more
quietly
every
hour
now
one
hears
some
horrible
thing
this
morning
that
young
dick
staveling
dead
shot
in
some
skirmish
or
another
fine
boy
he
was
they
all
going
out
one
after
the
other
not
useless
idiots
who
are
wanted
here
like
john
or
vincent
but
boys
boys
like
like
roddy
again
her
voice
trembled
for
the
first
time
in
his
knowledge
of
her
some
pity
for
her
stirred
in
him
for
the
first
time
in
her
knowledge
of
him
she
definitely
looked
to
him
with
some
appeal
roddy
came
to
see
me
yesterday
she
said
yes
said
christopher
he
had
not
been
so
often
as
he
used
i
told
him
so
he
made
some
feeble
apology
but
i
can
see
that
he
will
not
come
again
so
often
he
would
have
interrupted
her
but
she
went
on
he
not
happy
but
he
loves
her
madly
madly
he
did
not
tell
me
so
but
i
could
see
that
that
was
something
i
had
never
reckoned
on
you
prefer
christopher
said
sharply
to
imagine
that
he
is
not
happy
i
know
unfortunately
what
your
feeling
is
about
rachel
fond
of
him
though
you
are
you
prefer
that
he
was
unhappy
with
her
i
know
that
he
is
unhappy
he
would
not
care
for
her
so
much
if
she
returned
it
i
know
roddy
but
she
clever
enough
she
broke
off
if
roddy
were
to
go
out
to
south
africa
she
said
i
think
i
would
kill
rachel
then
die
happy
forgive
me
christopher
said
but
this
is
sheer
melodrama
rachel
is
devoted
to
roddy
and
roddy
to
rachel
i
the
best
means
for
knowing
even
as
he
spoke
he
saw
her
mouth
curve
with
that
smile
that
was
always
the
wickedest
thing
about
her
he
had
seen
it
on
many
occasions
and
it
always
meant
that
then
in
her
heart
there
was
something
cruel
or
remorseless
it
gave
her
now
an
elfin
look
so
that
amongst
the
absurd
furniture
of
the
room
she
took
her
place
as
some
old
witch
might
take
hers
amongst
the
paraphernalia
of
her
incantations
her
cauldron
her
bones
her
noxious
herbs
that
shows
christopher
my
friend
that
you
know
very
little
i
a
piece
of
news
that
will
surprise
you
he
said
nothing
but
in
his
heart
made
ready
for
some
blow
what
would
you
say
if
our
rachel
your
rachel
and
my
rachel
had
found
a
new
friend
in
my
worthy
most
admirable
nephew
francis
rachel
rachel
and
breton
the
duchess
watched
him
with
amusement
exactly
i
have
the
surest
information
what
does
your
information
say
he
hated
her
at
that
moment
as
he
had
never
hated
her
before
it
says
and
i
know
that
it
is
true
that
for
more
than
a
year
now
they
have
been
meeting
and
corresponding
the
other
day
rachel
went
to
tea
with
him
alone
was
with
him
alone
for
some
time
i
sure
that
roddy
knows
nothing
of
this
it
impossible
impossible
rachel
is
the
soul
of
honour
i
know
that
you
have
always
thought
so
but
what
more
likely
their
feeling
about
myself
would
alone
be
enough
but
he
would
not
let
her
see
how
hardly
he
was
taking
it
he
deprived
her
of
her
triumph
did
not
even
question
her
as
to
what
she
would
do
with
it
turned
the
conversation
into
other
channels
and
left
her
at
last
seeming
there
amongst
her
candles
with
her
nose
and
thin
hands
like
some
old
bird
of
most
evil
omen
iii
but
for
him
there
was
to
be
no
more
peace
it
was
now
about
four
and
already
the
dusk
was
closing
in
about
the
town
he
decided
that
he
would
go
and
see
whether
rachel
were
in
he
was
determined
that
he
would
ask
rachel
nothing
if
she
wished
to
speak
to
him
he
would
help
her
but
it
must
be
of
her
own
free
will
that
was
the
only
way
at
present
for
how
much
was
the
duchess
malignity
responsible
what
exactly
did
she
know
what
did
she
intend
to
do
oddly
enough
for
a
long
time
past
some
subconscious
part
of
him
had
linked
rachel
and
breton
together
perhaps
because
they
were
the
two
persons
in
all
the
world
for
whom
he
most
cared
perhaps
because
he
had
always
known
in
both
of
them
that
rebellious
discontent
so
unlike
that
beaminster
acquiescence
as
he
drove
through
the
evening
streets
he
felt
that
never
until
now
had
he
known
how
dearly
he
loved
rachel
in
his
mind
there
was
no
judgment
of
her
only
a
sense
of
her
peril
if
she
would
speak
to
him
when
he
asked
at
the
door
of
the
flat
for
lady
seddon
he
was
told
that
she
was
out
sir
roderick
is
at
home
sir
he
would
see
roddy
roddy
was
sitting
in
the
little
room
known
as
the
poring
over
a
war
map
about
the
map
little
flags
were
dotted
he
had
two
in
his
hand
and
with
one
hand
lifted
was
hesitating
as
to
their
position
that
was
a
damned
bad
mess
christopher
heard
him
say
as
he
came
in
at
the
sound
of
the
door
roddy
looked
up
straightened
himself
and
then
came
forward
hallo
christopher
he
said
delighted
splendid
rachel
out
but
she
said
she
be
back
to
tea
he
was
not
looking
well
fat
his
cheeks
pale
and
puffy
lines
beneath
his
eyes
i
jolly
glad
you
come
he
said
he
drew
two
to
the
fire
and
they
sat
down
roddy
then
talked
a
great
deal
he
was
always
a
little
nervous
with
christopher
because
he
was
well
aware
that
the
doctor
had
disapproved
of
his
marriage
christopher
had
lately
shown
him
that
he
liked
him
but
still
roddy
was
not
at
his
ease
he
talked
of
the
war
then
of
golf
then
polo
then
horses
seddon
court
abruptly
he
stopped
and
sat
there
gazing
moodily
into
the
fire
you
not
looking
well
seddon
christopher
said
quietly
i
not
very
nobody
at
their
liveliest
just
now
with
fellers
one
knows
droppin
out
any
minute
one
feels
a
bit
of
a
worm
keepin
out
of
it
all
skunkin
rather
moodily
he
sat
there
his
head
hanging
dejected
as
christopher
had
never
seen
him
before
suddenly
he
said
that
ai
quite
the
truth
doctor
i
a
bit
worried
my
dear
boy
christopher
said
putting
his
hand
on
the
knee
if
there
anything
in
the
world
i
can
do
for
you
tell
me
thank
you
you
a
brick
i
damned
unhappy
christopher
and
the
truth
rachel
said
christopher
yes
rachel
i
got
to
talk
to
somebody
i
been
goin
along
on
my
own
now
for
months
and
i
know
you
fond
of
her
i
am
said
christopher
more
than
of
anyone
in
the
world
i
know
that
how
i
can
talk
to
you
i
would
have
you
think
complainin
of
her
i
gettin
nothin
but
what
i
asked
for
you
know
but
it
just
this
when
she
took
me
she
never
said
she
loved
me
in
fact
she
said
she
did
but
i
thought
that
it
would
matter
all
you
wanted
in
marriage
was
just
to
be
pals
and
show
up
about
the
town
together
and
treat
one
another
honourably
well
said
roddy
taking
now
a
melancholy
interest
in
his
discoveries
concerning
himself
damn
it
all
if
i
have
rotted
the
bargain
by
fallin
in
love
with
her
jove
why
i
had
a
ghost
guess
at
what
love
meant
before
rachel
came
along
of
course
it
is
her
fault
you
could
expect
her
to
love
an
ordinary
sort
of
chap
like
me
just
like
a
million
other
fellers
knockin
about
but
she
so
unusual
there
ai
another
woman
in
the
world
so
surprisin
as
rachel
she
fond
of
me
he
went
on
i
know
that
but
what
i
want
she
just
ca
give
me
and
that
the
long
and
short
of
it
lately
it
been
terrible
hard
she
not
happy
and
that
makes
me
wild
and
every
day
that
passes
i
seem
to
want
her
more
nothin
else
no
one
else
matters
now
i
been
playin
golf
ridin
sittin
down
to
this
bridge
they
all
getting
mad
about
doin
every
blessed
thing
it
is
any
use
do
you
know
christopher
he
said
slowly
i
give
my
soul
to
make
her
happy
and
i
just
ca
i
know
said
christopher
but
it
worse
than
that
roddy
went
on
taking
up
the
poker
and
knocking
on
the
fire
lately
she
been
having
a
room
of
her
own
started
it
a
while
ago
as
a
temporary
thing
and
now
she
sticks
to
it
up
here
in
this
damned
town
we
hardly
see
one
another
always
a
crowd
either
here
or
outside
i
know
rachel
do
like
it
and
i
do
like
it
but
there
it
is
next
week
we
going
down
to
seddon
and
things
may
get
better
there
but
i
ca
stand
it
much
more
not
like
this
wait
a
bit
it
come
all
right
christopher
spoke
confidently
know
rachel
since
she
was
a
small
child
she
half
russian
you
know
you
must
always
remember
that
and
russian
and
beaminster
make
a
strange
mixture
wait
that
so
easy
to
say
roddy
answered
shaking
his
head
it
so
easy
to
say
but
i
do
see
just
what
goin
to
make
things
different
from
what
they
are
no
one
never
sees
said
christopher
and
then
destiny
comes
along
and
does
something
that
we
call
coincidence
and
just
settles
it
all
your
trouble
will
be
settled
roddy
if
you
patient
perhaps
roddy
said
slowly
you
could
see
her
a
bit
find
out
he
stopped
anything
in
the
world
i
can
do
i
will
we
find
a
way
meanwhile
seddon
there
is
a
bit
of
advice
i
can
give
you
what
that
asked
roddy
go
and
see
the
duchess
more
than
you
been
doing
see
her
a
lot
more
than
you
did
ever
oh
the
duchess
roddy
sighed
i
do
know
but
it
all
seems
different
with
her
now
i
changed
i
suppose
all
her
ideas
are
and
wrong
i
used
to
think
her
rather
splendid
yes
but
she
ill
and
old
and
you
the
only
person
in
the
world
she
cares
about
yes
i
go
said
roddy
slowly
i
known
i
ought
to
go
voices
broke
in
upon
them
the
door
opened
and
rachel
followed
by
her
friend
may
cremlin
once
may
eversley
came
in
oh
chris
you
dear
she
cried
and
came
forward
and
flung
her
arms
about
him
and
kissed
him
her
cheeks
were
flushed
from
her
black
furs
her
eyes
shone
at
him
some
thought
caught
him
he
knew
where
he
had
seen
that
excited
glitter
already
breton
at
luncheon
they
all
talked
then
christopher
said
that
he
must
go
rachel
came
with
him
to
the
door
in
the
hall
she
looked
at
him
defiantly
that
flash
he
knew
so
well
you
never
come
now
chris
you
given
me
up
i
do
care
for
you
in
a
crowd
very
much
there
always
a
crowd
now
ask
me
alone
and
i
come
she
said
but
still
her
eyes
were
defiant
no
he
said
gravely
i
do
no
asking
rachel
when
you
want
me
there
for
you
at
any
time
at
time
for
answer
she
flung
her
arms
again
about
him
and
hugged
him
her
heart
was
beating
furiously
then
without
another
word
she
left
him
iv
he
could
not
go
back
to
harley
street
yet
the
sense
of
apprehension
that
had
been
growing
with
him
all
day
would
give
him
a
melancholy
evening
were
he
to
spend
it
alone
he
thought
of
brun
someone
had
told
him
that
the
little
man
was
in
london
he
found
him
in
his
rooms
reading
with
a
cynical
expression
on
his
face
a
french
review
i
came
to
see
said
christopher
whether
you
happened
to
be
free
and
would
dine
with
me
i
a
pessimist
for
once
this
evening
and
it
does
suit
me
brun
was
very
very
sorry
but
he
was
dining
with
a
russian
princess
it
was
most
tiresome
that
he
should
have
to
waste
his
time
with
a
russian
princess
when
he
come
over
to
london
on
this
occasion
expressly
to
study
the
english
people
at
this
interesting
crisis
of
their
affairs
but
there
it
was
he
no
idea
how
he
let
himself
in
for
it
and
how
much
rather
would
he
spend
the
evening
with
his
friend
christopher
christopher
said
that
he
would
smoke
one
cigarette
and
that
then
he
must
go
and
so
you
feel
pessimistic
said
brun
looking
at
christopher
curiously
it
the
war
crois
how
alike
you
all
are
no
said
christopher
i
do
think
the
war
much
to
do
with
it
i
dare
say
the
war
a
very
good
thing
for
all
of
us
did
i
tell
you
said
brun
greatly
excited
then
pulled
himself
up
no
it
was
you
it
was
arkwright
more
than
a
year
ago
we
were
in
a
picture
gallery
looking
at
your
duchess
picture
and
coming
home
we
talked
i
said
then
that
something
would
come
that
something
come
and
that
then
everything
would
crumple
up
and
behold
cried
brun
his
eyes
flashing
see
it
crumples
that
a
little
previous
of
you
said
christopher
nothing
crumpled
yet
we
disturbed
of
course
it
is
most
lucky
brun
said
most
lucky
here
we
are
you
and
i
ordinary
people
enough
with
the
end
of
a
period
with
its
death
and
the
way
it
takes
it
all
for
us
to
watch
lucky
end
of
victorian
age
and
with
a
little
dramatic
gesture
he
waved
his
hand
as
though
he
were
flinging
the
age
and
its
lumber
away
out
of
the
window
you
know
christopher
he
went
on
i
seen
things
coming
over
here
for
so
long
all
you
people
you
could
have
gone
on
very
much
longer
so
remote
from
life
and
now
this
it
will
finish
your
duchess
your
beaminsters
your
queen
in
her
bonnet
your
sundays
and
your
religion
and
your
whigs
and
tories
and
all
your
hypocrisies
no
names
any
more
taken
just
because
they
always
been
taken
but
new
names
made
by
men
who
doing
things
nothing
taken
for
granted
any
more
your
beaminsters
will
vanish
and
then
you
have
your
denisons
and
oaks
and
ruddards
on
top
then
you
see
a
time
you
all
be
spinning
like
a
top
dancing
dancing
like
dervishes
then
while
you
busy
dancing
up
the
other
people
will
quietly
come
all
the
real
people
the
individualists
women
will
have
their
justice
no
man
will
skunk
behind
his
garden
hedge
because
he
does
want
to
be
bothered
no
more
superstition
no
more
inefficiency
you
a
wonderful
fellow
brun
said
christopher
getting
up
and
flinging
away
the
end
of
his
cigarette
you
always
got
any
amount
to
say
but
do
you
never
think
of
people
as
people
not
as
theories
or
movements
or
developments
no
thank
god
i
do
that
for
the
sentimentalists
like
you
christopher
people
are
all
the
same
fools
or
knaves
well
i
glad
i
do
think
so
said
christopher
tell
me
brun
put
his
little
hand
on
the
other
elbow
your
beaminsters
now
how
are
they
they
all
right
the
duchess
i
hear
she
not
so
well
oh
nonsense
well
as
she
been
any
time
these
last
thirty
years
yes
so
i
glad
but
the
other
beaminsters
ah
i
must
go
quickly
and
call
to
see
them
burst
asunder
that
will
be
most
amusing
christopher
laughed
you
wo
see
the
duke
or
richard
beaminster
burst
he
said
they
like
you
no
personal
feeling
and
the
girl
lady
seddon
yes
she
stir
things
up
she
not
a
beaminster
or
only
enough
of
one
to
make
her
hate
the
family
and
she
does
hate
them
oh
my
dear
brun
you
got
an
absurdly
exaggerated
view
about
everything
you
twist
the
beaminsters
into
anything
to
make
them
fit
your
theory
oh
they
fit
it
right
enough
but
i
must
be
in
at
the
death
meet
there
together
christopher
things
will
occur
before
we
much
older
my
sentimentalist
christopher
shook
his
head
there
something
sinister
about
your
appearances
in
the
city
brun
the
carcases
are
there
will
brun
nodded
it
true
enough
this
time
he
said
chapter
ix
the
darkest
hour
so
god
help
us
and
god
knows
what
disorders
we
may
fall
into
home
and
to
bed
with
a
heavy
heart
of
samuel
i
during
that
terrible
december
week
in
england
suffered
more
defeats
to
her
arms
than
during
any
other
week
of
the
century
magersfontein
stormberg
colenso
their
names
leapt
one
after
another
on
to
the
screen
london
was
dismayed
london
was
impatient
easy
enough
to
declare
that
the
most
criminal
blunders
had
been
perpetrated
easy
enough
to
explain
how
one
would
oneself
have
conducted
this
or
that
manoeuvred
hither
or
thither
some
pawn
in
the
game
dismay
remained
a
wide
active
alarm
at
the
things
that
life
so
suddenly
real
and
dominating
and
destructive
might
in
the
future
be
preparing
to
lord
john
this
terrible
week
was
simply
the
climax
to
a
succession
of
disturbing
revelations
of
reality
all
his
days
had
he
been
denying
life
wrapping
it
up
in
one
covering
after
another
calling
it
finally
a
box
of
chocolates
or
a
racing
card
a
good
cigar
or
a
pretty
woman
knowing
at
his
heart
that
somewhere
in
the
dark
forest
the
wild
beast
was
waiting
for
him
hoping
that
he
might
survive
to
the
end
without
facing
it
now
it
was
before
him
and
its
glittering
eyes
were
upon
him
he
had
gone
on
the
friday
of
this
week
to
pay
a
visit
at
a
country
house
near
newmarket
many
jolly
happy
he
had
spent
at
this
same
house
on
other
occasions
now
from
first
to
last
it
was
nightmare
on
the
monday
morning
at
breakfast
a
sudden
conviction
of
the
impossible
horror
of
this
world
struck
at
his
heart
it
came
as
a
revelation
life
was
for
him
never
to
be
the
same
again
his
hostess
a
lady
planted
at
the
end
of
the
table
like
an
enormous
artificial
toy
in
the
middle
of
whose
back
some
key
must
be
turned
if
the
affair
is
to
amuse
the
crowd
suddenly
horrified
him
the
women
of
the
party
their
noses
a
little
blue
their
cheeks
a
touch
too
white
their
voices
hard
and
sharp
the
men
red
and
brown
boisterously
hearty
about
the
animals
they
hoped
to
kill
before
the
day
was
done
the
cold
food
in
a
glazed
and
greedy
row
the
hot
food
kidneys
fish
bacon
sausages
sizzling
and
scenting
the
air
the
table
itself
with
its
racks
of
toast
and
marmalade
and
silver
and
fruit
the
conversation
that
sounded
as
though
the
speakers
were
afraid
that
the
food
would
all
disappear
were
they
spontaneous
or
natural
all
these
things
suddenly
appeared
to
lord
john
in
a
very
horrible
light
so
that
in
an
instant
racing
and
women
and
clothes
and
food
were
banished
from
a
naked
biting
world
in
which
he
was
a
naked
solitary
figure
he
caught
a
train
as
one
flies
from
some
horrible
plague
he
arrived
in
london
breathless
confused
miserable
the
foundations
of
life
broken
from
beneath
him
here
he
found
lady
adela
in
a
like
condition
he
had
never
cared
very
greatly
for
his
sister
he
had
not
found
her
sympathetic
or
amusing
she
had
never
appealed
to
him
for
assistance
nor
challenged
his
violent
opposition
he
had
never
enquired
very
deeply
into
her
interests
she
had
much
correspondence
and
many
acquaintances
she
ran
he
supposed
the
house
or
at
least
directed
miss
rand
to
run
it
for
her
he
thought
her
a
rather
stupid
woman
but
then
all
the
beaminsters
thought
one
another
stupid
because
they
believed
so
intensely
in
the
duchess
and
she
had
always
made
a
point
of
seeing
that
individually
they
despised
one
another
although
collectively
they
faced
the
world
finally
adela
had
always
seemed
to
him
unsympathetic
towards
rachel
and
that
he
found
it
very
hard
to
forgive
but
then
he
often
reflected
they
were
all
with
the
exception
of
himself
a
most
unsentimental
family
he
wondered
sometimes
why
he
was
so
different
on
the
afternoon
of
his
return
from
newmarket
however
he
began
to
wonder
whether
after
all
adela
had
not
more
in
common
with
him
than
he
had
ever
expected
he
had
lunched
at
the
club
had
plunged
down
into
the
city
to
enquire
about
some
investments
it
had
begun
to
rain
and
he
had
returned
with
the
weight
of
that
gloomy
day
full
heavily
upon
him
he
did
not
as
a
rule
have
tea
but
he
needed
company
and
he
found
adela
in
the
little
next
to
the
library
a
little
room
with
faded
faded
pictures
groups
some
of
them
of
himself
and
vincent
and
richard
at
eton
and
oxford
faded
and
faded
chintzes
a
nice
cosy
friendly
room
full
of
old
associations
and
old
hopes
and
despairs
this
room
did
not
often
see
either
lady
adela
or
john
but
norris
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
had
put
tea
there
and
to
both
of
them
as
they
sat
over
the
fire
with
the
great
house
so
still
and
quiet
about
them
the
shabby
intimacy
of
the
little
place
was
grateful
john
disturbed
himself
out
of
his
normal
easy
geniality
noticed
that
adela
also
was
disturbed
that
dry
and
rather
gritty
assurance
that
had
all
her
life
protected
her
from
both
the
praise
and
abuse
of
her
and
women
was
absent
she
seemed
really
grateful
to
john
for
coming
to
have
tea
with
her
he
wondered
whether
she
felt
as
he
did
that
this
war
with
all
its
horrors
foreboded
in
some
manner
special
disasters
upon
the
beaminster
family
as
though
it
were
a
portent
to
be
read
of
all
men
of
the
destruction
and
ruin
of
that
family
poor
adela
he
thought
she
very
plain
if
she
asks
me
to
help
her
i
will
she
got
something
on
her
mind
rachel
here
lady
adela
said
looking
at
her
brother
nervously
now
yes
she
with
mother
she
came
to
say
to
her
she
and
roddy
are
going
down
to
seddon
yes
i
know
said
john
she
very
queer
very
odd
i
do
pretend
to
understand
her
we
all
queer
just
now
said
john
down
at
the
club
it
was
too
awful
no
other
subject
fellows
killed
fellows
going
out
to
be
killed
blunder
blame
disgrace
all
the
time
but
what
rachel
been
doing
odd
you
understand
her
better
than
i
do
said
his
sister
she
always
liked
you
better
i
did
my
best
with
her
but
she
never
cared
about
me
but
now
i
understand
her
less
than
ever
she
so
excited
and
hard
and
unnatural
something
happened
to
her
that
we
do
know
about
sure
john
said
nothing
he
was
unhappy
enough
about
rachel
but
he
did
not
intend
to
talk
to
adela
about
it
he
would
rather
not
talk
to
anyone
about
it
because
talking
only
brought
it
more
actually
in
front
of
him
besides
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
he
knew
that
he
had
been
cowardly
about
rachel
he
had
tried
to
pretend
to
himself
that
she
was
happy
when
he
had
known
that
she
was
not
and
so
for
the
sake
of
his
comfort
he
had
stifled
the
most
genuine
emotion
in
his
life
that
indeed
was
the
beaminster
habit
she
not
happy
continued
adela
i
sure
i
do
know
why
very
good
to
her
very
good
she
so
queer
she
wants
to
have
miss
rand
down
with
her
at
seddon
for
christmas
miss
rand
yes
she
asked
me
whether
i
let
her
go
she
got
to
give
a
dance
and
a
or
two
and
asked
me
whether
she
might
have
her
help
of
course
i
said
miss
rand
has
been
looking
at
all
well
for
some
time
now
a
change
will
do
her
good
what
did
miss
rand
say
when
you
told
her
oh
she
was
odd
she
has
been
odd
lately
at
first
she
thought
she
would
go
then
she
said
she
would
i
told
her
it
would
do
her
good
how
mother
been
the
last
two
days
oh
the
same
she
wo
say
anything
she
confides
in
nobody
john
looked
at
his
sister
and
wondered
why
it
was
that
he
had
never
during
all
these
years
considered
her
as
a
personality
or
as
anything
actively
happy
or
miserable
she
had
had
he
suddenly
supposed
a
life
of
her
own
that
was
in
a
way
as
acute
and
sensitive
as
his
and
yet
he
had
never
realized
this
he
had
always
taken
his
mother
word
for
it
that
adela
was
a
stick
who
resented
interference
now
he
was
sure
that
that
judgment
was
and
then
upon
this
came
criticism
of
his
mother
therefore
to
banish
such
disloyalty
he
said
hurriedly
i
did
enjoy
the
massiters
a
bit
longed
to
get
away
sunday
was
miserable
adela
said
i
never
could
bear
them
john
she
stopped
yes
he
said
looking
across
at
her
his
large
eyes
met
hers
and
then
the
colour
mounted
very
slowly
into
her
cheeks
he
had
never
seen
her
agitated
before
john
she
began
again
i
must
do
something
i
ca
sit
here
just
quietly
going
on
as
though
nothing
were
happening
i
know
all
life
one
stood
aside
rather
i
never
wanted
to
interfere
with
anyone
but
now
this
war
has
made
one
feel
differently
i
think
well
said
her
brother
well
an
organization
is
being
formed
women
you
know
to
help
in
some
way
they
going
to
do
everything
make
clothes
have
sales
and
concerts
and
get
money
together
it
to
be
a
big
thing
nelly
ponsonby
clara
raddleton
lots
of
others
they
asked
me
to
be
on
the
committee
well
said
john
why
not
she
looked
at
him
appealingly
bronson
on
it
too
one
of
the
originators
of
it
oh
john
was
silent
here
was
indeed
a
question
bronson
the
beaminster
bronson
who
had
snapped
her
bejewelled
american
fingers
at
the
duchess
bronson
who
called
the
beaminsters
the
most
insulting
names
why
a
fortnight
ago
any
alliance
with
such
a
woman
was
unthinkable
incredible
i
believe
went
on
lady
adela
that
she
herself
proposed
that
i
should
be
asked
a
fortnight
ago
and
now
john
knew
that
he
was
glad
that
adela
wished
to
join
the
committee
he
knew
that
he
was
closer
to
adela
now
than
he
had
ever
been
at
any
moment
during
their
lives
together
he
looked
across
at
her
and
their
eyes
met
and
in
that
glance
exchanged
between
them
barriers
were
broken
down
curtains
turned
aside
they
would
never
be
strangers
again
mother
is
well
adela
said
quite
firmly
has
been
well
for
a
long
time
we
all
known
it
she
has
felt
this
war
and
and
other
things
very
much
she
will
feel
my
going
on
to
the
same
committee
as
bronson
she
will
certainly
feel
it
but
i
think
it
my
duty
to
do
so
after
all
on
an
occasion
like
this
family
feeling
must
give
way
before
national
ones
why
did
not
the
walls
and
foundations
of
no
portland
place
rock
and
quiver
before
the
horrid
sacrilege
of
such
words
john
himself
almost
expected
them
to
do
so
and
yet
he
was
of
his
sister
opinion
i
think
you
are
perfectly
right
adela
he
said
oh
i
so
glad
that
you
do
i
do
want
to
worry
mother
just
now
i
frankly
rather
nervous
about
telling
her
but
it
must
be
done
it
odd
adela
said
john
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
crossing
his
fat
legs
but
something
real
like
this
war
a
ghastly
day
with
boys
shouting
horrors
at
you
followed
by
another
ghastly
day
with
more
boys
shouting
more
horrors
it
does
shake
one
life
up
i
been
very
cowardly
adela
about
a
number
of
things
i
see
that
now
i
never
really
wanted
to
see
it
before
it
makes
one
uncomfortable
i
do
think
one
ought
to
give
way
said
adela
with
a
slight
return
to
her
gritty
manner
to
one
feelings
too
much
but
certainly
one
is
beginning
to
see
things
differently
which
is
a
dangerous
thing
for
people
of
our
age
john
yes
said
john
i
suppose
it
is
he
paused
and
then
brought
out
there
francis
adela
we
all
been
very
wrong
about
francis
i
felt
it
for
a
long
time
but
had
the
courage
he
been
behaving
very
well
all
this
time
one
ought
to
hold
aloof
altogether
mother
refuses
to
have
his
name
mentioned
we
must
take
into
account
john
said
very
slowly
and
now
without
meeting
his
sister
eye
that
mother
is
not
so
well
scarcely
so
sure
in
her
judgment
he
broke
off
there
was
a
long
pause
and
they
looked
away
from
one
another
as
though
they
had
been
guilty
conspirators
norris
came
in
to
take
the
tea
away
has
lady
seddon
gone
yes
my
lady
she
was
with
her
grace
a
very
short
time
adela
turned
impatiently
to
john
so
like
rachel
she
might
at
least
have
come
to
say
to
us
when
norris
had
gone
john
got
up
and
walked
a
little
about
the
room
he
stopped
beside
his
sister
and
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
if
there
anything
i
can
ever
do
to
help
you
adela
tell
me
he
said
thank
you
john
she
answered
ii
rachel
had
never
understood
why
it
was
that
she
was
driven
so
constantly
into
her
grandmother
presence
the
impulse
that
drove
her
had
in
it
perhaps
something
of
defiance
and
something
of
challenge
as
though
she
cried
to
some
weakness
in
her
that
it
should
not
master
her
and
that
she
would
just
show
it
how
little
those
visits
mattered
to
her
it
had
all
begun
from
some
reason
of
that
kind
and
lately
when
she
grew
older
she
discovered
that
her
grandmother
was
more
terrible
through
imagination
than
she
was
through
actual
vision
there
was
never
absent
from
rachel
a
lurking
presentiment
of
what
her
grandmother
might
one
day
do
and
she
went
to
see
her
now
to
discover
what
she
might
be
at
to
prove
to
her
that
whatever
she
be
doing
rachel
was
up
to
her
on
this
particular
occasion
the
visit
was
a
very
brief
one
but
there
was
one
moment
in
it
that
after
events
always
produced
for
rachel
as
a
most
definite
and
on
the
part
of
the
duchess
omniscient
omen
rachel
had
said
that
she
had
come
in
only
for
a
moment
to
say
she
had
talked
a
little
and
then
rising
stood
by
the
fire
as
she
stood
there
her
grandmother
suddenly
looked
at
her
a
glance
that
rachel
had
not
been
intended
to
catch
there
was
there
a
malicious
humour
a
consciousness
of
some
power
of
some
disaster
that
could
be
delivered
triumphantly
at
an
instant
notice
very
swiftly
rachel
gathered
her
control
but
she
had
felt
what
that
look
conveyed
francis
she
knows
what
is
she
going
to
do
she
strung
her
slim
tall
figure
to
its
finest
restraint
and
without
a
quiver
in
her
voice
her
heart
was
beating
wildly
grandmamma
i
promised
roddy
to
be
back
but
the
old
lady
looked
at
her
how
you
do
hate
me
my
dear
she
said
almost
complacently
rachel
compelled
the
other
eyes
would
i
come
to
see
you
so
often
if
i
did
she
said
yes
my
dear
you
would
you
got
a
sense
of
humour
hidden
somewhere
although
god
knows
we
seen
little
enough
of
it
lately
oh
yes
you
come
all
right
if
it
were
only
to
see
me
growing
older
and
older
rachel
turned
flaming
there
at
any
rate
you
unjust
it
you
that
have
always
hated
me
from
the
beginning
since
i
was
small
hated
me
been
unjust
to
me
her
body
trembled
with
agitation
she
was
not
far
from
one
of
her
old
tempests
of
passion
but
the
duchess
smiled
you
exaggerate
rachel
your
old
fault
at
any
rate
i
be
gone
soon
i
suppose
it
will
seem
trivial
enough
one
day
then
as
rachel
turning
to
the
door
left
her
but
hurt
a
hair
of
roddy
head
my
dear
and
well
you
hate
me
more
than
ever
iii
when
rachel
had
gone
the
duchess
felt
very
ill
indeed
she
had
only
to
touch
a
bell
and
dorchester
would
be
with
her
but
she
did
not
intend
to
summon
dorchester
before
she
need
she
felt
now
at
this
minute
that
her
spirit
of
resistance
had
almost
snapped
again
and
again
throughout
the
last
months
the
temptation
to
lie
down
and
surrender
had
swept
up
beaten
about
her
walls
and
then
sunk
defeated
back
again
but
this
last
week
of
disaster
had
tried
her
severely
her
pride
in
life
had
been
largely
her
pride
in
the
arrangement
of
it
and
now
all
that
arrangement
was
tumbling
to
pieces
and
she
powerless
to
prevent
it
for
the
first
time
in
all
her
days
she
felt
that
she
would
like
to
have
someone
with
her
who
would
reassure
her
someone
less
acid
than
dorchester
why
had
she
never
had
a
companion
a
woman
like
miss
rand
who
would
understand
without
being
sentimental
there
was
pain
in
every
muscle
and
nerve
of
her
body
it
swept
up
and
down
her
old
limbs
in
hot
waves
she
clutched
the
arms
of
her
chair
even
her
brain
that
had
always
been
so
sharp
and
clear
was
now
confused
a
little
and
passed
strange
unusual
pictures
before
her
eyes
that
girl
yes
dorchester
had
been
very
clever
about
that
dorchester
had
been
in
communication
with
breton
for
a
long
time
past
to
go
to
tea
there
to
be
alone
with
him
roddy
and
at
that
dearly
loved
name
all
was
sharp
and
accurate
night
and
day
she
was
terrified
lest
she
should
suddenly
hear
that
he
was
off
to
south
africa
she
believed
that
that
would
really
kill
her
roddy
her
roddy
to
go
and
make
another
of
those
ghastly
tragedies
with
which
the
newspapers
were
now
full
but
let
rachel
disdain
him
and
he
would
go
merely
to
show
her
how
fine
a
fellow
he
was
what
idiots
men
were
or
let
this
other
thing
become
a
scandal
then
surely
he
would
go
she
shook
there
in
her
chair
and
then
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
prayed
to
whatever
gods
or
devils
were
hers
that
he
might
not
go
anything
anything
so
that
he
might
not
go
break
him
up
hurt
him
only
only
he
must
not
go
she
prayed
thrusting
her
whole
soul
and
spirit
into
her
urgency
then
even
as
she
sat
there
her
darkest
hour
was
suddenly
upon
her
it
leapt
upon
her
as
it
were
a
beast
out
of
some
sudden
darknesses
leapt
upon
her
seized
her
tore
her
crushed
her
little
dried
withered
soul
in
its
claws
and
tossed
it
to
the
fire
she
was
held
by
the
sudden
absolute
realization
of
death
she
had
never
seen
it
or
known
it
before
others
had
died
and
she
had
not
cared
many
were
dying
now
and
it
did
not
concern
her
but
this
beast
crouching
in
front
of
her
with
its
burning
eyes
on
her
face
said
to
her
all
your
life
i
been
beside
you
waiting
for
this
moment
i
knew
that
it
would
come
i
have
waited
a
long
time
you
have
played
and
thought
yourself
important
and
have
cared
for
meddling
in
the
affairs
of
the
world
but
reality
has
never
touched
you
you
have
gathered
things
about
you
to
pretend
that
i
was
not
there
you
have
mocked
at
others
when
they
have
seen
me
you
have
enjoyed
their
terror
now
your
own
terror
has
come
death
she
had
never
until
this
instant
given
it
a
thought
everything
was
gone
before
its
presence
in
a
week
or
two
a
month
or
two
silence
rachel
she
saw
her
standing
there
by
the
fire
full
of
life
and
energy
so
young
so
strong
she
the
duchess
of
wrexe
the
great
figure
courted
by
kings
princes
artists
all
the
men
and
women
of
her
time
now
must
crumble
into
the
veriest
dust
be
forgotten
be
followed
by
others
banished
by
this
new
world
she
and
her
times
were
slipping
slipping
into
disuse
who
cared
now
for
those
other
glories
what
minds
now
were
fit
to
tackle
those
minds
that
she
had
known
what
beauty
now
could
stand
beside
that
beauty
that
had
shone
when
she
was
young
the
beast
crouched
nearer
the
room
darkened
she
could
feel
the
hot
breath
could
be
dazed
by
the
shining
of
those
eyes
behind
her
around
her
the
trumpery
toys
that
she
had
gathered
faded
darkness
rose
a
great
space
and
desolation
was
about
her
she
tried
to
summon
all
her
energy
she
cried
out
and
dorchester
coming
in
found
that
her
mistress
had
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
fainted
bending
an
old
broken
woman
forward
in
her
chair
chapter
x
lizzie
journey
ii
i
the
world
during
all
these
months
had
seemed
to
lizzie
rand
a
very
silent
place
before
that
july
night
it
had
been
loud
with
incident
coloured
with
possibilities
strange
and
varied
and
thrilling
now
she
was
only
conscious
of
the
duties
that
must
be
fulfilled
between
daybreak
and
darkness
she
was
unconscious
of
all
life
and
movement
only
she
was
aware
of
the
demands
on
her
deliberate
activity
these
demands
she
obeyed
slowly
as
the
dreary
autumn
dragged
its
days
past
her
she
accustomed
herself
to
forestall
the
horrid
moments
that
would
leap
from
some
hidden
darkness
upon
her
there
was
the
moment
when
a
something
said
fancy
caring
for
someone
who
had
never
asked
nor
shown
any
sign
another
moment
when
something
said
remember
how
here
you
stood
with
your
heart
beating
waiting
for
him
to
come
there
you
caught
some
light
in
his
eyes
and
fancied
it
a
sign
burning
shame
was
in
those
moments
did
she
indulge
them
a
realization
too
of
the
bare
grey
desolation
of
a
world
without
movement
or
vision
she
could
not
see
the
people
about
her
her
mother
her
sister
lady
adela
christopher
always
kind
to
her
other
friends
they
were
not
there
for
her
at
all
only
two
things
were
there
that
she
must
cling
at
all
possible
costs
to
her
pride
and
that
she
hated
rachel
her
pride
had
been
called
to
her
defence
before
but
to
hate
anyone
was
new
to
her
she
had
never
hated
any
human
being
and
now
the
restlessness
that
this
new
emotion
brought
confused
her
night
after
night
stretched
ironically
before
her
banishing
sleep
all
her
life
she
had
slept
from
the
moment
that
her
head
was
upon
the
pillow
now
at
that
instant
her
brain
sprang
to
fire
thought
after
thought
memory
after
memory
passed
in
dancing
procession
before
her
she
saw
him
as
little
as
possible
she
supposed
that
in
time
she
would
not
care
would
be
indifferent
to
him
she
hoped
so
meanwhile
she
went
out
when
he
came
in
saw
his
kind
distress
because
he
thought
that
she
was
not
well
and
shuddered
at
it
then
lady
adela
told
her
that
rachel
had
asked
whether
she
were
free
for
christmas
she
received
a
letter
dear
miss
rand
i
wonder
whether
by
any
chance
you
would
care
to
come
to
us
here
for
three
weeks
at
christmas
time
i
should
be
so
grateful
if
you
would
come
and
help
me
a
little
with
some
tiresome
social
things
here
may
i
add
that
i
have
for
a
long
time
wanted
to
know
you
better
than
the
london
rush
ever
gives
time
for
my
aunt
says
that
you
have
been
overworking
lately
she
thinks
if
you
come
here
you
shall
have
all
the
rest
and
quiet
possible
yours
sincerely
rachel
seddon
a
funny
little
letter
stiff
and
then
suddenly
impulsive
and
friendly
of
course
she
would
go
she
had
never
doubted
that
here
at
last
was
some
food
for
the
burning
restlessness
that
was
always
at
her
breast
through
these
months
she
had
longed
for
some
step
that
would
help
to
kill
the
pain
now
she
would
watch
rachel
and
discover
her
heart
and
perhaps
find
from
that
discovery
some
way
for
her
own
release
for
her
shame
night
and
day
was
that
she
still
cared
cared
yes
as
deeply
as
she
had
ever
done
that
caring
must
die
perhaps
the
sight
and
knowledge
of
this
other
woman
would
kill
it
at
least
here
at
last
was
action
after
the
terrible
silence
and
remoteness
of
those
many
months
she
would
go
to
seddon
and
she
would
not
leave
it
without
finding
some
way
by
which
she
might
still
make
some
use
of
life
ii
she
had
really
stayed
at
very
few
houses
before
the
anticipation
at
any
other
time
would
have
excited
her
now
nothing
mattered
except
that
she
would
meet
rachel
her
mother
and
sister
had
watched
her
during
these
past
months
with
a
dismay
stirred
by
the
sudden
absence
of
her
genial
friendliness
they
had
taken
so
much
of
her
kindliness
for
granted
and
now
when
she
refused
them
the
sympathy
that
they
had
always
demanded
for
a
thousand
unimportant
incidents
they
clamorously
missed
it
at
first
it
was
easy
to
say
that
lizzie
was
callous
and
selfish
afterwards
that
she
was
ill
and
overworked
finally
they
hailed
with
relief
the
promise
of
a
holiday
she
come
back
said
rand
as
fresh
as
paint
and
taken
out
of
herself
meanwhile
no
solution
of
lizzie
trouble
occurred
to
them
that
she
should
ever
feel
the
tyranny
of
love
like
more
sentimental
mortals
was
at
this
time
of
day
impossible
we
know
lizzie
thank
you
said
rand
they
watched
her
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
december
depart
in
a
cab
for
seddon
court
she
was
grave
and
pale
and
beautifully
neat
i
do
admire
lizzie
you
know
said
daisy
returning
with
her
mother
into
the
house
i
ca
get
that
kind
of
tidiness
her
things
go
on
for
years
looking
as
good
as
new
men
like
a
bit
of
disorder
said
rand
it
seems
more
agitated
all
the
same
i
like
to
know
what
is
worrying
lizzie
it
was
a
wet
and
gusty
day
and
the
wind
blew
the
rain
with
hard
impatient
spurts
against
the
windows
of
the
cab
few
people
were
about
hyde
park
corner
was
grey
and
deserted
umbrellas
like
black
mushrooms
started
here
and
there
from
the
shining
ground
victoria
station
also
had
on
this
afternoon
nothing
beautiful
to
offer
she
found
her
way
to
her
train
chose
an
empty
carriage
sat
in
her
corner
with
her
hands
upon
her
lap
waited
for
the
train
to
move
people
grey
people
with
white
faces
hurried
past
her
carriage
she
wondered
whether
they
too
had
something
in
their
hearts
that
made
every
thought
every
movement
a
danger
because
the
train
would
not
move
and
because
for
the
first
time
in
all
these
months
she
found
herself
without
any
occupation
she
could
not
hold
thought
at
bay
she
resisted
she
tried
to
sweep
her
brain
empty
she
surrendered
she
lizzie
rand
always
so
fond
of
her
and
restraint
found
control
now
slipping
from
her
before
she
had
met
breton
her
duties
the
skilful
manipulation
and
arrangement
of
detail
her
work
and
her
place
as
a
worker
these
had
supplied
her
needs
now
all
those
things
were
dust
and
ashes
high
and
lofty
above
them
shone
that
bright
fire
whose
warmth
and
colour
she
had
for
an
instant
felt
and
seen
what
was
life
going
to
be
through
all
the
years
to
come
if
she
were
never
to
recapture
her
tranquillity
the
train
moved
off
and
she
sat
there
her
eyes
bright
and
shining
her
little
body
stiff
and
resolute
somewhere
a
long
way
away
like
a
rounded
coloured
cloud
hovered
emotion
emotion
that
would
break
her
heart
would
tear
her
to
pieces
and
then
perhaps
build
up
for
her
a
new
life
but
her
eyes
now
were
dry
and
her
heart
was
cold
the
train
went
and
the
telegraph
wires
flew
up
hung
hesitated
were
coming
down
flew
higher
then
with
a
rush
were
buried
below
the
window
and
with
the
noise
and
movement
there
danced
before
her
eyes
the
questions
does
she
love
him
does
she
love
him
has
she
told
him
that
she
loves
him
what
will
her
husband
do
does
she
love
her
husband
and
then
beyond
that
why
did
she
come
and
take
from
me
all
that
i
had
she
who
had
already
so
much
and
then
most
bitter
of
all
ah
but
you
never
had
him
she
took
nothing
from
you
he
never
thought
of
you
except
as
someone
to
whom
he
could
talk
she
had
no
doubt
that
these
weeks
were
intended
for
a
crisis
something
was
going
to
happen
at
seddon
something
in
which
she
was
to
have
her
share
she
felt
as
though
she
had
known
that
she
would
be
sent
to
meet
rachel
it
had
to
be
then
her
thoughts
left
for
a
time
her
own
miserable
little
history
she
wondered
how
lady
adela
would
manage
without
her
lady
adela
had
never
been
alone
before
and
now
that
the
duchess
had
had
a
fortnight
ago
that
fainting
fit
they
were
all
unsettled
and
alarmed
what
would
happen
if
the
duchess
died
then
all
the
dignity
and
splendour
of
portland
place
would
pass
away
other
people
might
inhabit
it
but
the
soul
of
that
house
would
be
dead
everything
on
every
side
of
her
seemed
to
be
hastening
to
a
climax
and
lizzie
could
see
that
old
woman
fighting
behind
her
closed
doors
for
life
beaten
at
last
dead
swept
away
others
laughing
in
her
place
a
new
world
to
whom
she
was
only
a
portrait
cleverly
painted
by
some
young
artist
yes
there
were
other
histories
developing
now
besides
lizzie
and
she
felt
as
though
she
had
been
whirled
during
the
last
months
into
a
wild
tossing
medley
of
contacts
and
revelations
all
this
after
a
life
so
grey
and
quiet
and
steadily
busy
as
the
train
plunged
into
sussex
the
rain
stayed
for
a
little
and
the
shining
earth
steamed
upwards
to
a
grey
sky
broken
here
and
there
to
saffron
little
towns
quietly
rested
under
the
hills
and
many
streams
ran
through
the
woods
and
the
roads
drove
white
like
steel
through
the
crust
of
the
soil
white
lights
spread
in
the
upper
air
and
the
heaving
grey
was
pushed
as
though
by
some
hand
back
into
the
distant
horizon
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
the
sun
was
bursting
through
trees
were
suddenly
green
where
they
had
been
black
and
fields
red
where
they
had
been
sombre
dark
light
was
on
all
the
hills
but
the
hand
was
stayed
back
the
grey
rolled
again
heavily
like
chariots
the
clouds
wheeled
round
and
drove
down
upon
the
earth
the
rain
fell
the
carriage
was
very
cold
lizzie
hand
and
feet
were
so
chill
that
they
seemed
not
to
belong
to
her
at
all
pictures
of
houses
at
brighton
and
the
of
some
train
and
two
at
the
bottom
of
a
hill
stared
at
her
the
sense
of
some
coming
disaster
grew
with
her
it
was
as
though
someone
were
telling
her
that
she
must
prepare
to
be
very
brave
and
controlled
and
wise
because
very
soon
all
her
restraint
and
wisdom
would
be
needed
she
summoned
now
as
she
had
learnt
to
do
a
stern
armoured
resolution
that
sat
always
a
little
oddly
upon
her
any
observer
who
had
seen
her
sitting
there
would
have
noticed
the
mild
softness
of
her
eyes
the
tenderness
of
some
curve
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
and
would
have
smiled
at
the
lines
of
resolution
as
though
he
had
known
that
the
sternness
was
all
assumed
but
she
was
saying
that
nothing
should
touch
or
move
her
down
here
at
seddon
her
heart
should
be
closed
she
must
grow
into
a
woman
who
had
no
need
of
emotion
and
even
as
she
determined
that
some
vision
swept
her
by
revealing
to
her
the
happy
dear
uses
that
she
could
have
made
of
love
and
sympathy
had
life
been
set
that
way
for
her
how
she
could
have
cared
a
dry
little
sob
was
at
her
throat
and
burning
pain
behind
her
tearless
eyes
god
the
things
that
other
people
had
and
did
not
value
the
train
stopped
at
a
deserted
station
and
a
man
and
woman
with
a
little
child
the
three
of
them
tired
wet
bedraggled
entered
the
carriage
the
man
was
gaunt
with
a
beard
and
large
helpless
eyes
the
woman
shapeless
little
eyes
sunk
in
her
cheeks
an
old
black
straw
hat
tilted
back
on
her
head
these
two
did
not
glance
at
lizzie
nor
was
there
any
curiosity
of
interest
in
their
eyes
but
the
small
child
yellow
wisps
of
hair
falling
about
her
dirty
face
detached
herself
from
them
crept
into
the
furthest
corner
of
the
carriage
and
from
there
stared
at
lizzie
the
train
droned
on
through
a
country
now
shrinking
beneath
a
deluge
of
rain
the
child
moved
a
little
looked
at
the
woman
looked
again
at
lizzie
crept
to
lizzie
side
of
the
carriage
at
last
still
without
a
word
came
close
and
finally
stole
fingers
towards
lizzie
dress
lizzie
turned
and
smiled
at
the
child
who
stared
back
at
her
now
with
wide
terrified
eyes
lizzie
looked
away
out
of
the
window
and
after
a
long
time
felt
the
grimy
hand
upon
her
knee
once
the
woman
said
come
away
cissie
you
worrying
the
lady
no
please
said
lizzie
she
took
the
hand
in
her
own
and
smiled
again
at
the
wide
baby
face
the
child
was
very
very
young
and
very
very
dirty
no
child
had
ever
come
near
her
before
she
wondered
why
it
had
come
now
iii
at
lewes
a
carriage
was
waiting
for
her
and
in
a
moment
it
seemed
that
she
was
driving
through
a
dark
village
street
and
in
front
of
her
like
a
great
wall
topping
the
skies
the
downs
rose
when
the
carriage
entered
the
courtyard
and
stopped
before
the
broad
stone
door
lizzie
was
seized
with
terror
she
wished
oh
she
wished
that
she
had
not
come
the
sense
of
descending
trouble
was
so
strong
with
her
that
she
felt
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
she
was
going
to
prove
unequal
to
her
task
her
life
was
over
and
done
with
why
had
she
allowed
herself
to
be
pushed
back
again
into
all
these
affairs
of
other
people
she
was
ushered
into
a
square
lighted
hall
where
they
were
all
having
tea
round
a
wide
open
fireplace
she
was
conscious
of
rachel
rising
slim
and
tall
to
greet
her
of
the
square
man
who
gripped
her
hand
jolly
hard
and
was
of
course
sir
roderick
of
a
handsome
girl
in
a
of
a
man
or
two
and
an
elderly
smartly
dressed
woman
they
were
all
immensely
cheerful
and
friendly
and
to
lizzie
white
and
tired
noisy
and
horribly
robust
she
would
have
liked
to
have
slipped
up
to
her
room
and
stayed
there
alone
until
dinner
but
rachel
said
oh
you
must
be
perished
after
that
wet
journey
tea
just
at
its
hottest
and
its
freshest
quick
roddy
the
toast
never
mind
the
rest
of
us
miss
rand
just
drink
that
tea
and
get
warm
they
allowed
her
to
sink
back
into
an
easy
chair
somewhere
in
the
shadow
and
the
tea
was
very
comforting
and
the
stern
hall
with
its
crackling
fire
and
its
cosy
solid
shape
most
friendly
she
listened
to
them
all
noisily
discussing
people
and
dances
and
horses
and
dinners
she
watched
rachel
seddon
sitting
a
little
gravely
straight
in
her
chair
throwing
in
a
word
now
and
again
this
was
the
woman
this
was
the
woman
she
felt
a
warm
tongue
that
licked
her
hand
she
looked
down
and
saw
at
her
side
the
oddest
dog
a
dog
like
a
mat
shapeless
with
two
brown
eyes
behind
its
hair
and
a
black
wet
nose
there
was
something
about
the
eyes
and
the
way
that
the
warm
body
was
pressed
against
her
dress
that
won
her
instant
affection
what
an
adorable
animal
she
said
to
roddy
who
was
sitting
next
to
her
oh
jacob
he
said
laughing
he
really
ought
to
be
in
here
at
all
servants
hall
his
proper
place
if
you
care
for
dogs
miss
rand
i
show
you
some
as
he
spoke
she
caught
the
dog
eyes
and
saw
in
the
depths
of
them
shame
he
had
been
sitting
very
square
and
upright
with
his
eyes
gravely
fixed
with
great
interest
upon
the
company
then
at
the
sound
of
roddy
voice
his
head
had
dropped
instantly
he
became
furtive
his
eyes
searching
for
some
place
of
escape
her
hand
caught
his
rough
coat
and
she
drew
him
to
her
side
and
stroked
his
ears
i
think
he
perfectly
delightful
she
said
i
afraid
i
prefer
mongrels
to
better
dogs
do
you
really
said
roddy
looking
kindly
at
her
my
word
miss
rand
i
must
show
you
my
little
lot
i
do
think
you
have
much
use
for
that
animal
there
afterwards
at
last
the
girl
in
the
and
the
other
woman
and
the
young
man
noisily
departed
rachel
took
lizzie
upstairs
are
you
sure
she
said
you
like
to
come
down
to
dinner
would
you
rather
go
early
to
bed
and
have
it
there
no
thank
you
lady
seddon
lizzie
looked
about
the
room
this
is
all
splendid
thank
you
i
not
a
bit
tired
i
so
glad
you
come
said
rachel
searching
for
lizzie
eyes
but
lizzie
had
turned
away
at
last
she
was
alone
her
room
was
splendid
so
wide
and
high
and
such
a
fire
she
flung
up
her
window
there
the
downs
were
black
huge
before
her
the
rain
came
down
hissing
from
the
sky
and
a
smell
of
wet
earth
and
grass
stole
up
to
her
that
the
woman
she
said
again
to
herself
what
shall
we
say
to
one
another
then
as
she
stared
into
the
fire
she
thought
she
wants
me
to
help
her
afterwards
she
heard
a
scratching
at
the
door
a
maid
had
been
sent
to
her
but
she
had
dismissed
her
saying
that
she
would
manage
for
herself
she
went
to
the
door
and
found
outside
it
the
shaggy
square
dog
he
walked
into
her
room
sniffed
for
a
time
at
the
bed
pricked
up
his
ears
at
the
noise
that
the
fire
made
listened
to
the
sound
of
the
rain
at
last
sat
down
in
a
distant
corner
with
one
leg
stretched
at
right
angles
to
his
body
and
watched
her
she
was
indignant
with
herself
for
the
softness
in
her
heart
that
his
company
brought
to
her
chapter
xi
roddy
is
master
i
and
my
mistress
side
by
side
shall
be
together
breathe
and
ride
so
one
day
more
am
i
deified
who
knows
but
the
world
may
end
robert
browning
i
introspection
had
been
always
to
roddy
a
thing
unknown
he
had
never
regarded
himself
as
in
any
way
different
from
the
other
men
whom
he
met
and
he
would
have
been
greatly
distressed
had
he
thought
that
he
what
you
writin
fellers
he
had
once
said
to
garden
can
find
amusin
in
inventin
people
for
i
ca
think
you
got
to
make
odd
for
people
to
be
interested
in
and
then
they
are
like
anyone
now
however
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
would
have
been
glad
of
help
from
someone
who
knew
a
little
about
the
motive
of
human
beings
he
was
worried
distressed
perplexed
slowly
his
temper
was
rising
a
temper
roused
by
his
irritation
at
not
being
able
to
deal
with
the
situation
it
was
not
his
way
to
ask
for
help
from
anyone
and
he
always
had
all
the
inarticulate
of
the
healthy
englishman
but
now
as
the
days
crept
towards
christmas
he
was
increasingly
aware
that
something
must
soon
happen
to
prevent
his
patience
giving
away
he
might
as
well
not
be
married
to
rachel
at
all
and
that
was
an
intolerable
position
for
him
as
husband
as
lover
as
master
of
his
house
beyond
doubt
he
knew
rachel
less
now
than
he
had
known
her
when
he
married
her
her
very
kindness
to
him
her
strange
alternations
of
silence
and
affection
perplexed
him
for
a
long
time
he
had
told
himself
that
he
knew
that
she
did
not
love
him
and
that
he
must
make
companionship
do
but
ever
since
that
quarrel
about
nita
raseley
the
division
between
them
had
grown
wider
and
wider
because
he
loved
her
he
had
been
very
patient
with
her
very
patient
for
roddy
who
had
always
had
what
he
wanted
and
shown
temper
if
he
were
refused
but
roddy
character
was
of
a
very
real
simplicity
the
men
and
women
and
animals
whom
he
had
known
had
also
been
for
the
most
part
of
a
simple
character
and
in
all
his
life
there
had
only
been
one
horse
and
two
women
who
had
been
too
much
for
him
and
even
these
at
the
last
he
had
beaten
by
temper
and
dogged
determination
rachel
was
utterly
beyond
him
the
strange
way
that
she
had
of
suddenly
becoming
quite
another
woman
baffled
him
had
he
only
not
loved
her
he
was
sure
that
it
would
have
been
easier
much
easier
but
now
as
the
days
passed
at
seddon
his
irritation
thrived
women
were
all
the
same
they
obstinate
enough
but
there
was
nothing
like
brute
force
to
bring
them
to
heel
he
was
growing
surly
cross
with
the
servants
and
the
animals
he
did
sleep
his
discontent
made
him
silent
so
that
when
they
were
alone
instead
of
talking
to
her
and
interesting
her
and
winning
her
perhaps
in
that
way
he
would
sit
and
look
at
her
and
answer
her
in
monosyllables
and
afterwards
would
be
furious
with
himself
for
behaving
so
absurdly
this
trouble
sent
him
out
of
doors
and
away
over
the
downs
on
his
horse
fiercely
he
hurled
himself
into
his
fields
and
lanes
and
farms
getting
up
sometimes
very
early
and
riding
out
to
some
distant
place
thinking
always
as
he
rode
of
rachel
and
what
he
was
to
do
his
devotion
for
the
country
round
seddon
a
devotion
that
had
stirred
his
heart
since
his
first
conscious
sight
of
the
outside
world
nobly
now
rewarded
him
the
land
seemed
to
understand
that
he
was
suffering
and
drew
closer
to
him
and
watched
him
with
gentle
and
loving
eyes
and
soothed
his
soul
before
christmas
there
came
some
sharp
frosty
mornings
he
would
go
out
very
early
and
would
see
first
the
garden
the
lawn
crisp
and
white
the
grey
jagged
wall
that
divided
his
land
from
the
sweeping
downs
the
grey
house
behind
him
so
square
and
solid
and
comfortable
at
the
end
of
the
garden
away
from
the
road
there
was
an
old
iron
gate
with
stone
pillars
and
upon
these
pillars
sat
old
stone
gryphons
these
gryphons
had
been
there
since
long
ago
and
he
liked
the
friendliness
of
their
faces
the
strength
of
their
crouching
bodies
and
the
way
that
they
would
look
out
so
patiently
over
a
great
expanse
of
fields
and
hedges
until
their
gaze
rested
on
the
white
chalk
hollows
in
the
rising
hills
away
behind
lewes
roddy
standing
with
the
downs
so
immediately
behind
him
and
this
green
spread
of
land
in
front
of
him
was
always
conscious
of
happiness
here
he
was
at
home
he
knew
those
fields
the
streams
that
ran
through
them
the
farmers
the
labourers
the
horses
and
dogs
that
lived
upon
them
no
fear
here
that
one
of
those
clever
fellers
would
wonder
at
his
stupidity
no
sudden
letting
you
down
or
showing
you
up
behind
him
was
his
house
before
him
the
land
that
he
had
always
known
here
he
was
safe
he
had
too
beyond
this
some
unformulated
recognition
of
a
service
and
a
worship
that
here
he
was
called
on
to
pay
he
had
always
declared
that
he
could
understand
those
johnnies
who
worshipped
the
sun
and
the
earth
damn
it
all
there
something
to
catch
on
to
there
he
did
not
in
his
heart
believe
in
all
this
civilization
this
preserving
of
the
sick
and
tending
of
the
maimed
and
halt
you
got
to
clear
out
if
broken
up
was
his
opinion
if
you
ca
do
your
bit
ca
see
or
smell
or
anything
you
just
in
the
way
what
he
meant
was
that
the
halt
and
maimed
were
simply
insults
to
the
vigour
and
vitality
of
his
fields
and
sky
but
indeed
what
he
have
done
during
these
days
had
he
not
had
his
riding
farms
to
visit
shepherds
and
farmers
for
company
at
first
rachel
had
ridden
with
him
and
they
had
been
closer
together
during
those
rides
than
at
any
other
time
but
lately
she
had
refused
on
one
excuse
or
another
to
come
with
him
he
went
a
good
deal
now
to
other
houses
but
it
was
awkward
because
rachel
would
not
come
with
him
she
asked
people
to
seddon
and
was
charming
when
they
came
but
she
would
not
often
go
out
with
him
when
the
country
people
invited
them
since
the
nita
raseley
episode
he
had
thought
that
she
might
show
jealousy
did
he
ride
and
drive
with
some
girl
in
the
country
he
hoped
that
she
would
be
jealous
that
would
have
filled
him
with
tingling
happiness
but
no
she
seemed
to
be
glad
that
he
should
find
someone
who
could
take
her
place
over
all
these
things
he
brooded
and
brooded
he
would
look
at
his
old
friendly
gryphons
and
feel
in
some
dumb
confused
way
that
they
were
being
poor
old
beggars
i
bet
she
does
know
there
and
through
all
of
this
he
loved
her
more
and
more
and
was
daily
more
wretched
and
unhappy
ii
the
coming
of
miss
rand
puzzled
him
he
had
of
course
known
of
her
for
a
long
time
adela
beaminster
secretary
most
capable
woman
simply
runs
the
whole
place
as
a
human
being
she
simply
did
not
occur
to
him
now
she
seemed
to
be
the
one
person
whom
rachel
wished
to
know
another
instance
of
rachel
unexpectedness
when
lizzie
came
he
was
still
more
astonished
this
tidy
trim
little
woman
looked
as
though
she
ought
always
to
have
a
typewriter
by
her
side
her
sharp
eyes
were
always
restlessly
discovering
things
that
were
out
of
order
roddy
found
himself
fingering
his
tie
and
patting
his
hair
when
she
was
with
him
not
he
would
have
supposed
the
sort
of
woman
for
whom
rachel
would
have
cared
then
after
a
while
he
discovered
another
astonishing
thing
miss
rand
did
not
like
his
wife
did
not
like
her
at
all
he
watched
and
fancied
that
rachel
soon
discovered
this
and
was
doing
her
utmost
to
force
miss
rand
to
like
her
miss
rand
was
always
pleasant
and
polite
she
was
an
immense
help
about
dinners
and
this
dance
that
was
to
be
given
early
in
the
new
year
but
she
yielded
to
none
of
rachel
advances
was
always
reserved
unresponsive
roddy
was
afraid
of
her
but
believed
in
her
she
liked
animals
and
loved
the
house
and
the
downs
and
the
she
all
clean
and
bright
and
hard
he
thought
no
emotion
about
her
no
sentiment
a
man
have
a
stiff
time
with
her
but
it
gradually
appeared
that
whatever
her
feelings
might
be
towards
rachel
she
was
ready
to
like
roddy
she
walked
with
him
asked
him
sensible
questions
listened
attentively
to
his
rather
lumbering
explanations
after
a
time
he
almost
forgot
that
she
was
a
woman
at
all
damn
sensible
and
yet
she
never
makes
you
feel
a
fool
he
liked
her
very
much
though
she
obviously
preferred
jacob
the
mongrel
to
all
other
dogs
in
the
place
he
wondered
as
the
days
passed
whether
she
might
not
help
him
with
rachel
he
would
not
speak
to
anyone
living
about
his
own
feelings
for
rachel
and
his
unhappiness
but
he
thought
that
perhaps
in
a
roundabout
way
he
might
obtain
from
miss
rand
some
general
wisdom
that
he
could
apply
to
his
especial
case
the
afternoon
of
christmas
eve
was
cold
and
foggy
and
roddy
and
lizzie
sat
over
the
fire
in
the
hall
waiting
for
rachel
who
had
gone
out
for
a
solitary
walk
roddy
looking
at
his
companion
approved
of
the
sharp
delicate
little
face
with
the
firelight
touching
it
to
colour
and
shadow
her
dress
was
grey
with
a
tiny
brooch
of
old
gold
at
her
throat
and
she
wore
one
ring
of
small
pearls
the
look
of
her
gave
him
pleasure
i
wonder
miss
rand
said
that
you
do
go
where
you
get
better
hunting
you
do
hunt
round
here
at
all
do
you
a
bit
roddy
looked
gravely
at
the
fire
i
go
very
little
though
you
see
miss
rand
it
a
case
of
bein
born
down
here
and
likin
the
place
do
you
know
i
love
to
have
been
born
in
a
huntin
country
but
bein
here
i
got
fond
of
it
you
see
and
would
leave
it
for
any
huntin
anywhere
she
looked
at
him
sharply
you
do
love
the
place
very
much
i
envy
you
that
even
as
she
spoke
her
consciousness
of
the
place
faced
her
she
had
always
known
that
she
was
more
acutely
aware
of
the
personality
of
her
surroundings
than
were
most
of
her
friends
but
her
experience
here
was
different
from
anything
that
she
had
ever
known
before
she
remembered
that
in
the
train
she
had
been
warned
of
some
coming
event
and
now
sitting
opposite
to
roddy
beside
the
blazing
fire
she
was
sharply
and
definitely
frightened
rachel
had
already
appealed
to
her
roddy
was
appealing
to
her
now
but
stronger
than
either
of
these
demands
was
some
force
in
herself
warning
her
and
raising
in
her
the
most
conflicting
disturbing
emotions
the
very
silence
of
the
house
about
them
the
long
green
stretches
of
the
level
fields
came
almost
personally
and
presented
themselves
to
her
and
in
her
heart
growing
with
every
moment
of
passing
time
was
her
hatred
of
rachel
and
from
that
tenderness
for
roddy
who
could
thus
be
left
so
pathetically
unhappy
so
eloquently
without
words
that
might
express
his
unhappiness
something
she
knew
was
soon
to
occur
that
would
involve
all
three
of
them
in
a
common
crisis
it
was
almost
as
though
she
must
leap
to
her
feet
and
cry
to
the
startled
and
innocent
roddy
look
out
her
finger
pointing
at
the
closed
door
behind
him
meanwhile
roddy
had
been
considering
her
she
said
that
she
envied
him
the
place
that
was
pleasant
of
her
and
he
warmed
to
the
urgency
with
which
she
had
said
it
if
she
felt
in
that
way
about
such
things
why
then
all
the
more
he
thought
he
could
speak
to
her
about
his
trouble
with
rachel
perhaps
too
although
this
he
would
not
admit
to
himself
his
conviction
that
lizzie
disliked
rachel
gave
him
more
courage
everyone
thought
rachel
so
wonderful
wonderful
of
course
she
was
but
a
complete
sense
of
that
wonder
must
blind
the
to
roddy
point
of
view
places
he
said
moodily
ai
everythin
course
love
this
old
bit
o
ground
but
when
you
love
anything
a
lot
you
disappointed
because
every
feller
do
see
it
exactly
as
you
do
lizzie
looked
at
him
i
should
have
thought
though
sir
roderick
that
you
were
a
very
very
happy
person
roddy
considered
then
slowly
shook
his
head
no
miss
rand
not
exactly
no
you
know
i
should
say
that
exactly
but
then
i
suppose
no
man
on
this
earth
is
absolutely
happy
well
said
lizzie
a
great
many
people
would
envy
you
your
health
your
home
your
wife
you
got
a
good
deal
sir
roderick
as
she
spoke
her
anxiety
to
help
him
seized
and
held
her
he
wanted
advice
so
badly
advice
that
she
could
give
him
and
this
english
strain
in
him
prevented
him
from
speaking
had
she
gone
more
deeply
into
her
motives
she
would
have
known
that
her
anger
with
rachel
even
more
actively
prompted
it
seemed
by
the
stones
and
the
fields
and
the
hills
around
her
was
urging
her
interference
people
envy
me
said
roddy
but
then
miss
rand
people
do
know
it
all
my
own
fault
mind
you
that
i
not
perfectly
happy
it
all
because
i
such
a
fool
not
able
to
see
what
people
are
gettin
at
always
blunderin
in
at
the
wrong
moment
and
blunderin
out
again
when
i
ought
to
be
stayin
in
and
that
sort
o
thing
i
used
to
think
he
concluded
that
all
the
talk
about
people
feelin
studying
them
and
so
on
was
rot
but
now
i
not
so
sure
i
give
anythin
he
stopped
abruptly
it
all
rot
lizzie
said
sharply
i
can
only
speak
as
a
woman
of
course
but
i
know
that
what
every
woman
ever
born
into
this
world
has
wanted
is
just
to
be
taken
by
someone
stronger
than
herself
and
be
beaten
or
kissed
loved
or
strangled
as
the
case
may
be
believe
me
it
is
so
roddy
looked
at
her
some
new
thought
perhaps
a
prologue
to
some
new
determination
shining
from
his
eyes
by
jove
he
said
i
believe
you
right
miss
rand
i
do
indeed
woman
would
you
say
every
woman
said
lizzie
firmly
their
eyes
met
the
sure
steadiness
of
her
gaze
the
way
that
she
sat
there
her
little
body
so
sure
and
resolute
her
very
neat
composure
an
argument
against
lightheaded
reasoning
encouraged
him
beyond
any
help
that
he
had
yet
found
their
gaze
seemed
long
and
intimate
the
colour
rose
and
flushed
his
brown
cheeks
and
into
his
eyes
there
crept
that
consciousness
of
a
victory
about
to
be
won
although
the
odds
were
hard
against
him
the
door
opened
behind
him
and
he
turned
at
the
sound
and
saw
that
rachel
had
come
in
her
entry
gave
him
now
as
it
always
did
a
conviction
that
during
her
absence
he
had
had
the
least
idea
as
to
how
splendid
she
really
was
she
brought
into
that
little
stone
hall
a
wild
colour
a
strong
fine
challenge
to
anything
small
or
shackled
or
conventional
her
walk
had
given
her
cheeks
a
flame
the
black
furs
round
her
throat
the
black
coat
falling
below
her
knees
a
red
feather
in
her
round
black
fur
cap
all
these
things
set
off
and
accentuated
the
brilliant
fire
and
energy
of
her
eyes
as
she
came
towards
them
then
so
splendid
was
she
that
lizzie
was
herself
for
an
instant
lost
in
admiration
she
lit
the
hall
she
lit
the
house
she
lit
the
country
and
the
evening
sky
to
roddy
as
he
looked
at
her
there
stole
the
spirit
of
some
pagan
ancestor
telling
him
that
here
was
his
capture
that
this
fine
creature
was
his
to
bind
to
burden
to
chastise
as
his
lordly
pleasure
might
be
rachel
meanwhile
had
come
in
from
her
walk
unappeased
unsated
the
exertion
had
only
succeeded
in
stirring
in
her
a
deeper
more
urgent
uneasiness
during
these
last
weeks
she
had
known
no
moment
of
peace
she
had
come
down
to
seddon
determined
to
do
her
duty
to
roddy
she
had
found
that
at
every
turn
her
duty
to
roddy
involved
more
than
any
determination
could
force
her
to
give
she
had
not
known
what
that
last
interview
with
breton
would
do
to
every
situation
that
followed
it
it
seemed
to
her
then
that
those
last
words
with
him
would
make
her
duty
plain
they
had
only
made
her
duty
harder
she
could
not
now
act
think
sleep
move
but
that
last
kiss
those
last
words
of
his
that
last
vision
of
him
standing
struggling
so
finely
for
control
these
things
pursued
her
caught
her
eyes
and
held
them
all
her
duty
to
roddy
could
not
hide
from
her
now
that
she
had
at
one
flaming
instant
known
what
life
at
its
most
intense
could
be
she
had
felt
the
fire
how
cold
to
her
now
these
antechambers
these
passages
so
chill
so
far
from
that
inner
room
lizzie
had
then
occurred
to
her
as
the
strongest
person
she
knew
she
sent
for
lizzie
found
instantly
that
lizzie
disliked
her
suspected
then
that
lizzie
knew
about
breton
she
knew
lizzie
for
her
enemy
during
the
last
week
also
she
had
detected
a
new
attitude
in
roddy
she
had
felt
in
him
some
active
growing
impatience
that
quite
definitely
threatened
her
safety
that
wild
lawlessness
in
roddy
that
she
had
always
known
that
had
produced
the
nita
episode
and
others
was
now
turning
towards
herself
but
most
of
all
did
she
fear
her
thoughts
of
breton
she
drove
him
again
and
again
and
again
from
her
mind
she
called
all
her
strength
mental
moral
and
physical
to
her
aid
always
with
a
smile
with
one
glance
from
his
eyes
he
defeated
her
day
and
night
he
was
with
her
and
yet
at
her
heart
she
did
not
even
now
know
whether
it
were
francis
breton
whom
she
loved
or
the
life
with
roddy
the
whole
beaminster
scheme
of
things
that
she
hated
every
day
it
seemed
to
her
that
lizzie
was
more
watchful
roddy
more
impatient
breton
more
insistent
but
afraid
of
them
all
as
she
was
fear
of
herself
gave
her
the
sharpest
terror
she
rang
for
tea
reproached
them
because
they
had
waited
for
her
then
they
were
all
three
of
them
silent
one
of
the
footmen
brought
in
the
five
post
with
the
tea
and
laid
rachel
letters
on
the
table
at
her
side
lizzie
had
leant
across
the
table
for
something
and
saw
as
though
flashed
to
her
by
some
special
designing
providence
that
the
letter
on
the
top
of
the
pile
was
in
francis
breton
handwriting
rachel
busied
with
tea
had
not
looked
down
now
she
did
so
the
handwriting
rose
as
though
she
had
at
that
instant
heard
his
step
beyond
the
room
and
filled
first
her
eyes
then
her
cheeks
then
her
heart
her
eyes
met
lizzie
and
for
the
barest
moment
of
time
their
challenges
met
rachel
seemed
to
hesitate
then
gathering
up
her
letters
looked
round
at
roddy
and
said
i
think
i
just
go
up
and
take
my
things
off
this
fire
hotter
than
i
expected
i
be
back
in
a
moment
she
walked
slowly
across
the
room
and
up
the
broad
staircase
iii
she
did
not
switch
on
the
light
the
evening
dusk
left
the
room
cool
and
dim
but
by
the
window
standing
so
that
green
shadows
met
the
grey
and
through
them
both
a
pale
light
trembled
before
it
vanished
she
took
the
letter
in
her
hand
allowing
the
others
to
drop
and
be
scattered
white
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
she
held
the
envelope
he
had
written
and
he
had
sworn
to
her
that
he
would
not
do
so
she
should
have
been
furious
at
his
broken
word
scornful
of
him
for
his
weakness
indignant
at
his
treating
her
so
lightly
but
she
could
not
think
of
that
now
she
could
only
think
of
the
letter
the
envelope
was
so
precious
to
her
that
it
seemed
to
return
the
caress
that
his
fingers
gave
it
and
to
have
of
itself
some
especial
individuality
she
traced
his
hand
on
the
address
treasured
every
line
and
mark
and
then
at
last
tore
it
open
it
was
not
a
very
long
letter
he
had
written
to
her
you
will
despise
me
for
breaking
my
word
perhaps
you
read
this
but
i
help
it
i
help
it
and
even
if
i
could
i
do
think
that
i
would
i
know
that
my
writing
to
you
is
just
another
of
the
rash
foolish
silly
weak
things
that
i
gone
on
doing
all
my
life
but
let
it
be
so
i
pretend
to
be
fine
or
brave
and
i
have
tried
all
these
weeks
tried
harder
than
you
can
know
i
written
to
you
every
day
letter
after
letter
and
torn
them
up
torn
them
all
up
fancied
that
perhaps
you
forgotten
by
now
and
then
known
that
you
not
and
then
i
known
that
it
were
better
if
you
did
i
love
you
so
madly
that
here
he
had
scratched
some
words
out
i
must
tell
you
that
i
love
you
so
that
can
hear
me
and
not
only
my
walls
and
furniture
and
my
own
self
i
trying
not
to
be
selfish
i
know
that
i
doing
something
now
that
is
hard
on
you
but
my
silence
is
eating
me
thrusting
killing
i
shall
be
better
soon
i
will
be
sensible
soon
i
will
be
but
now
oh
my
darling
for
a
moment
at
least
i
have
caught
you
and
held
you
throbbing
against
me
and
put
my
hands
in
your
hair
and
stroked
your
cheeks
and
kissed
your
eyes
do
write
to
me
if
you
must
not
do
be
angry
with
me
for
this
i
will
try
not
to
break
my
word
again
as
the
letter
ended
so
silence
came
back
into
the
room
that
had
been
beating
and
throbbing
with
sound
the
pale
light
had
gone
only
the
downs
were
dim
grey
shapes
against
a
darker
sky
the
ripple
of
some
water
slipping
and
falling
came
from
the
garden
the
letter
fell
from
her
hands
and
lay
white
with
the
others
on
the
floor
she
tumbled
on
to
her
knees
by
the
window
and
her
heart
was
the
strangest
confusion
of
triumph
and
fear
exultation
and
shame
for
a
little
time
she
lay
there
and
felt
that
she
was
in
his
arms
and
that
his
lips
were
on
her
mouth
and
that
her
hand
pressed
his
cheek
she
got
up
turned
on
the
lights
took
off
her
walking
things
brushed
her
hair
and
washed
her
hands
picked
up
the
other
letters
but
put
his
in
the
inside
of
her
dress
then
went
down
to
the
others
iv
she
found
lizzie
sitting
alone
where
roddy
lizzie
looked
up
at
her
he
had
to
go
and
see
about
a
horse
or
something
rachel
came
down
to
the
table
and
poured
out
some
tea
and
then
sat
smiling
at
lizzie
lizzie
smiled
back
i
hope
you
liked
your
walk
yes
there
a
storm
coming
up
you
no
idea
how
deeply
one
gets
to
care
for
these
downs
their
quiet
and
their
size
they
were
silent
for
a
little
and
then
rachel
said
miss
rand
i
do
hope
that
this
really
has
been
something
of
a
holiday
for
you
being
here
away
from
all
your
london
work
lizzie
eyes
were
sharp
yes
it
delightful
for
me
the
first
holiday
i
had
for
years
do
think
it
impulsive
of
me
but
i
asked
you
here
hoping
that
we
get
to
know
one
another
better
i
wanted
to
know
you
to
have
you
for
a
friend
for
a
long
time
i
always
admired
so
immensely
the
way
that
you
helped
aunt
adela
done
things
that
i
could
never
possibly
have
done
she
stopped
but
lizzie
said
nothing
then
she
went
on
more
uncertainly
you
see
i
hoped
that
perhaps
you
teach
me
a
little
order
and
method
i
married
so
young
i
hoped
then
almost
desperately
but
you
know
miss
rand
i
do
feel
as
though
your
coming
here
has
helped
us
to
know
one
another
any
better
the
storm
had
come
up
and
the
sky
beyond
the
house
was
black
face
lighted
by
the
fire
was
white
sharp
and
set
there
was
no
kindness
in
her
eyes
perhaps
lady
rachel
she
said
slowly
i
not
a
very
emotional
kind
of
woman
if
one
worked
as
i
have
since
one
was
small
had
to
earn
one
living
and
fight
for
one
place
it
makes
one
perhaps
rather
and
independent
of
other
people
our
lives
have
been
so
different
i
afraid
she
added
with
a
little
laugh
that
i
a
unsatisfactory
kind
of
person
i
know
that
my
mother
and
sister
have
always
found
me
so
yes
rachel
said
our
lives
been
different
perhaps
if
mine
had
been
a
little
more
like
yours
perhaps
if
had
had
to
work
for
my
living
i
she
broke
off
a
little
catch
was
in
her
voice
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
went
to
the
window
and
stood
there
with
her
back
to
lizzie
gazing
into
the
darkening
garden
she
knew
that
lizzie
had
repulsed
her
she
was
hardly
aware
why
she
had
made
her
appeal
but
she
was
now
frightened
of
lizzie
and
to
her
overstrung
brain
it
seemed
that
she
could
now
see
lizzie
and
roddy
in
league
against
her
she
heard
a
step
and
turning
round
found
peters
the
butler
large
square
of
an
immense
impassivity
please
my
lady
might
i
speak
to
you
a
moment
she
went
out
lizzie
left
in
the
darkening
room
could
think
now
only
of
the
letter
the
sight
of
that
handwriting
had
stirred
in
her
passions
that
she
had
never
before
imagined
as
hers
that
first
pathetic
appeal
of
roddy
and
then
the
sight
of
that
letter
her
brain
working
feverishly
showed
her
the
words
that
that
letter
would
contain
the
passion
the
passion
there
in
the
very
face
of
her
husband
rachel
was
receiving
letters
from
her
lover
letters
that
she
could
not
wait
a
moment
to
read
but
must
go
instantly
and
open
this
hour
brought
to
a
crisis
lizzie
agony
had
such
a
letter
been
written
to
her
she
tortured
herself
now
with
the
picture
of
him
as
he
sat
there
in
his
room
in
saxton
square
writing
it
it
appeared
to
her
now
as
though
they
two
there
in
the
very
throne
of
their
triumphant
love
had
plotted
this
insult
this
snap
of
the
fingers
to
show
her
lizzie
rand
how
desolate
how
lonely
how
neglected
and
unwanted
she
was
that
then
after
this
rachel
should
appeal
to
her
for
friendship
the
cruel
insult
of
it
she
felt
as
she
heard
the
fast
drops
of
rain
lash
the
that
no
revenge
that
she
could
secure
would
satisfy
her
thirst
for
it
v
roddy
meanwhile
had
gone
out
to
the
stables
that
little
talk
with
lizzie
had
determined
a
resolution
that
had
been
growing
now
within
him
for
many
weeks
that
little
woman
with
her
assured
air
and
neat
little
ways
knew
what
she
was
about
knew
moreover
what
others
were
about
she
had
watched
and
had
given
him
the
tip
he
would
take
it
roddy
mind
was
of
far
too
simple
an
order
to
admit
of
more
than
one
point
of
view
at
a
time
he
saw
rachel
now
as
a
dog
or
horse
of
whom
he
was
very
fond
who
needed
nevertheless
stern
discipline
he
wondered
now
how
it
was
that
he
had
allowed
himself
for
so
long
to
remain
indecisive
london
muddles
a
feller
he
concluded
the
country
the
place
for
clear
thinkin
he
looked
at
his
horses
with
great
satisfaction
they
were
in
splendid
condition
he
had
never
known
them
better
he
also
was
in
splendid
condition
never
been
better
as
he
walked
away
from
the
stables
and
turned
towards
the
end
of
the
garden
bounded
by
the
gryphons
and
the
stone
gate
he
felt
his
body
at
its
most
supreme
perfection
he
thought
on
that
afternoon
that
he
was
strong
enough
for
anything
and
perhaps
never
before
in
his
life
had
he
been
so
conscious
of
the
glories
of
physical
things
of
all
that
it
meant
to
have
fine
muscles
and
a
strong
heart
and
lungs
of
the
best
and
thews
and
sinews
as
good
as
any
feller
i
strong
enough
for
anythin
he
turned
back
his
arm
and
felt
his
muscle
he
cocked
his
head
with
a
little
conceited
gesture
of
satisfaction
i
was
gettin
a
bit
fat
in
london
got
rid
of
all
that
to
walk
to
ride
to
fight
to
swim
to
eat
and
sleep
to
love
women
and
drink
strong
drink
god
what
a
world
and
then
beyond
it
all
rachel
rachel
rachel
he
had
her
now
she
should
be
under
his
hand
she
should
be
his
as
she
had
never
been
since
the
first
week
of
their
marriage
no
more
nonsense
by
god
he
said
triumphantly
to
himself
no
more
nonsense
he
leaned
on
the
stone
gate
and
looked
out
over
the
fields
the
gryphons
regarded
him
benevolently
he
was
conscious
as
he
stood
there
of
the
duchess
what
was
the
old
lady
doing
he
like
to
see
her
he
felt
more
in
sympathy
with
her
than
he
had
been
for
a
long
time
past
she
right
after
all
you
got
to
stand
up
and
run
people
no
use
just
lettin
them
handle
you
there
was
a
storm
coming
up
the
white
lights
of
the
higher
sky
were
being
closed
down
by
black
blocks
of
cloud
that
spread
from
one
to
another
merging
far
on
the
horizon
above
the
hills
into
driving
lines
of
rain
the
white
chalk
hollows
above
lewes
stood
out
sharp
and
clear
the
dark
green
of
the
fields
was
now
a
dull
grey
the
hedges
were
dark
and
a
thin
stream
that
cut
the
flat
surface
of
the
plain
was
black
like
ink
roddy
welcomed
the
storm
had
he
been
superstitious
the
physical
energy
that
now
pervaded
him
might
have
frightened
him
he
felt
as
though
with
one
raising
of
his
arm
he
could
hold
up
those
black
clouds
and
keep
them
off
the
rain
and
the
wind
had
not
more
force
than
he
life
was
a
vast
pæan
of
strength
the
weak
must
go
he
was
at
this
hour
lord
of
creation
as
he
went
back
to
the
house
the
rain
met
him
and
whipped
his
cheek
by
gad
i
like
to
find
the
old
lady
sittin
in
the
house
waitin
for
a
chat
he
thought
when
he
came
down
to
dinner
he
came
as
one
who
rules
the
world
that
simple
clear
light
was
in
his
eyes
that
was
always
there
when
he
had
found
the
solution
to
something
that
perplexed
him
his
expression
too
was
one
that
belonged
to
rachel
earlier
experience
of
him
one
that
she
had
not
seen
on
his
face
for
a
long
time
past
his
strong
but
rather
stupid
mouth
had
somewhere
in
its
corners
the
suspicion
of
a
smile
his
chin
stuck
out
rather
obstinately
the
light
in
the
eyes
the
smile
the
set
lips
these
things
revealed
the
old
roddy
after
dinner
lizzie
went
off
to
her
room
for
a
while
roddy
and
rachel
sat
there
she
read
some
book
her
eyes
often
leaving
the
page
and
staring
into
the
fire
then
she
got
up
and
said
good
night
she
came
over
and
bent
down
and
kissed
him
he
caught
her
arm
and
held
her
i
say
old
girl
it
time
we
had
the
same
room
again
much
more
convenient
he
heard
her
catch
her
breath
and
felt
her
tremble
she
tried
to
draw
her
arm
away
but
he
held
her
oh
but
soon
roddy
yes
but
not
just
now
i
yes
now
i
see
about
it
she
stepped
back
from
him
dragging
herself
away
and
then
put
her
hand
to
her
forehead
with
a
desperate
gesture
no
no
not
he
got
up
and
smiling
swaying
a
little
faced
her
yes
i
made
up
my
mind
all
this
business
has
got
to
come
to
an
end
been
goin
long
enough
what
business
seein
nothing
of
you
nothing
from
mornin
till
night
you
know
old
girl
it
is
fair
if
we
did
care
about
one
another
yes
i
know
but
do
let
discuss
it
i
tired
headachy
this
storm
he
said
nothing
she
looked
at
him
and
at
the
steady
stare
in
his
eyes
and
the
smile
at
his
mouth
turned
away
she
moved
towards
the
door
he
said
nothing
but
his
eyes
followed
her
good
night
she
said
turning
round
to
him
but
he
still
said
nothing
only
stood
there
very
square
and
set
for
a
long
time
he
sat
looking
into
the
fire
then
he
went
up
to
his
room
and
very
slowly
undressed
afterwards
he
came
out
carefully
closing
the
door
behind
him
then
in
and
pyjamas
went
down
the
passage
to
rachel
door
the
house
was
very
still
but
the
storm
was
raging
and
the
boughs
of
some
tree
hit
with
fierce
protesting
taps
a
window
at
the
he
knocked
at
her
door
waited
then
heard
her
ask
who
was
there
it
i
roddy
he
said
there
was
a
pause
then
the
door
was
opened
he
came
in
and
stood
in
the
doorway
rachel
was
sitting
up
in
bed
her
face
very
white
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
i
sleepin
here
rachel
he
said
her
voice
was
a
whisper
no
roddy
no
not
not
yes
he
said
firmly
no
not
yes
now
he
walked
carefully
across
the
room
took
off
his
and
hung
it
over
a
chair
he
looked
about
the
room
too
much
light
he
said
and
going
to
the
door
switched
off
all
the
lights
save
the
one
above
the
bed

rupert
brooke
i
that
night
lizzie
had
a
dream
and
waking
in
the
early
hours
of
the
grey
dim
morning
saw
before
her
every
detail
of
it
she
had
dreamt
that
she
was
lost
in
the
house
no
human
being
was
there
every
room
was
closed
and
she
knew
that
every
room
was
empty
it
was
full
day
but
only
a
dull
yellow
light
lit
the
she
could
not
find
her
way
to
the
central
staircase
a
passage
would
be
familiar
to
her
and
then
suddenly
would
be
dark
and
vague
and
menacing
she
opened
doors
and
found
wide
dusty
empty
rooms
with
windows
thick
in
cobwebs
and
beyond
them
a
garden
green
tangled
deserted
she
knew
that
if
she
did
not
escape
soon
some
disaster
would
overtake
her
some
disaster
in
which
both
roddy
and
rachel
would
be
involved
she
knew
also
that
in
some
way
rachel
safety
absolutely
depended
upon
her
she
felt
within
herself
a
struggle
as
to
whether
she
should
save
rachel
she
did
not
wish
to
save
rachel
but
some
impulse
drove
her
she
ran
down
the
passage
stumbling
in
the
strange
indistinct
yellow
light
she
knew
that
could
she
only
reach
the
garden
rachel
would
be
saved
she
reached
a
window
looked
down
and
saw
below
her
like
a
green
pond
the
lawn
overgrown
now
with
weeds
and
bristling
with
strange
twisted
plants
she
flung
open
the
window
and
tried
to
jump
but
a
cold
blast
of
some
storm
met
her
and
drove
her
back
the
storm
screamed
about
her
the
dust
rose
in
the
room
the
plants
in
the
garden
waved
their
heads
the
wind
rushed
through
the
house
and
she
heard
doors
banging
and
windows
creaking
she
knew
suddenly
that
she
was
too
late
rachel
was
dead
she
stood
there
thinking
i
thought
that
i
hated
her
i
know
now
that
i
loved
her
all
the
time
the
storm
died
down
died
away
a
voice
quite
close
to
her
said
you
made
a
mistake
miss
rand
people
have
souls
you
know
having
a
soul
of
your
own
is
more
important
than
criticizing
other
people
people
have
souls
you
know
she
woke
and
heard
a
clock
strike
seven
as
she
lay
there
a
sense
of
uneasiness
was
with
her
so
strongly
that
she
repeated
to
herself
half
sleeping
half
waking
i
wish
were
over
quite
over
quite
over
i
want
to
be
over
she
was
completely
wakened
by
a
sound
she
lay
there
for
a
little
time
wondering
what
it
was
then
she
realized
that
something
was
scratching
on
the
door
she
got
out
of
bed
opened
the
door
and
found
the
dog
jacob
sitting
in
the
long
dark
passage
looking
through
his
tangled
hair
into
space
as
though
the
very
last
thing
that
he
had
been
doing
had
been
trying
to
attract
her
attention
jacob
was
nearer
to
a
human
being
than
any
animal
that
she
had
ever
known
he
had
attached
himself
to
miss
rand
and
she
had
decided
after
watching
him
that
he
knew
more
about
the
situation
in
the
house
than
anyone
else
to
catch
him
as
he
watched
with
his
grave
brown
eyes
roddy
or
rachel
as
they
spoke
or
moved
was
to
have
no
kind
of
doubt
as
to
his
wisdom
his
deep
philosophy
his
penetration
into
motives
he
liked
miss
rand
but
she
knew
well
that
his
feeling
for
her
had
nothing
of
the
passionate
urgency
with
which
he
regarded
roddy
or
rachel
all
tragedy
the
depths
and
the
heights
of
it
she
had
seen
in
that
dog
eyes
fixed
with
the
deepest
devotion
upon
he
knows
she
had
often
thought
during
the
last
week
exactly
what
the
matter
with
all
of
us
he
always
slept
she
knew
in
a
basket
in
rachel
room
and
she
wondered
why
he
had
been
ejected
he
sat
now
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
seemed
deeply
unhappy
he
sat
square
with
his
legs
spread
out
his
hair
hanging
in
melancholy
locks
over
his
eyes
his
small
beard
giving
a
last
wistful
touch
to
his
expression
he
did
not
look
at
lizzie
or
show
any
interest
in
her
he
only
stared
before
him
at
the
pattern
on
the
wall
lizzie
did
not
attempt
to
pat
him
she
went
back
to
bed
and
lying
there
saw
the
light
gather
about
the
room
once
jacob
sighed
otherwise
he
made
no
movement
until
the
maid
came
in
with
lizzie
tea
then
he
crawled
under
the
bed
ii
when
she
came
down
to
breakfast
she
felt
that
she
could
not
endure
another
day
of
this
place
she
wished
now
for
no
revenge
upon
rachel
she
had
no
longer
any
curiosity
as
to
the
particular
feelings
of
any
one
of
these
people
for
any
other
she
felt
detached
from
them
all
and
utterly
absolutely
weary
she
was
weighed
down
with
a
sense
of
disaster
and
she
felt
that
she
must
instantly
escape
from
it
all
fling
herself
again
into
her
london
work
deal
with
the
tiresome
commonplaces
of
her
mother
and
sister
she
must
escape
roddy
was
sitting
alone
at
breakfast
and
she
saw
at
once
that
he
was
uneasy
he
seemed
to
avoid
her
eyes
and
he
coloured
as
she
came
towards
him
mornin
miss
rand
he
said
rachel
not
comin
down
bit
of
headache
rotten
night
i
did
have
a
very
good
night
either
that
storm
made
me
sleep
badly
yes
was
it
a
corker
it
all
right
though
she
looked
through
the
wide
high
windows
and
saw
out
over
a
country
painted
as
in
a
delicate
the
softest
green
and
dark
brown
lay
beneath
a
pale
blue
sky
very
still
very
gentle
tiny
white
puffs
of
cloud
were
blown
like
soap
bubbles
across
the
sun
so
that
bright
gleams
floated
and
passed
and
flashed
again
she
drew
a
deep
breath
nothing
terrifying
in
such
a
day
as
this
yes
it
beautiful
beautiful
i
off
for
the
day
roddy
said
ridin
she
helped
herself
to
some
breakfast
and
sat
down
roddy
said
well
no
one
would
ever
believe
had
a
bad
night
miss
rand
you
fresh
as
a
pin
thank
you
she
said
laughing
but
all
the
same
i
sleep
badly
i
not
feeling
princely
myself
he
confessed
that
why
i
off
for
a
ride
nothin
like
a
ride
to
take
you
out
of
yourself
you
ever
feel
miss
rand
that
you
want
to
get
right
away
from
yourself
and
be
someone
else
she
looked
at
him
roddy
was
in
real
trouble
his
very
physical
strength
showed
the
more
clearly
that
he
was
unhappy
his
fingers
moved
restlessly
his
eyes
were
never
still
she
looked
at
her
letters
there
was
one
from
lady
adela
oh
i
sorry
i
afraid
i
shall
have
to
go
back
almost
immediately
the
duchess
is
much
less
well
they
worried
about
her
the
duchess
roddy
started
up
and
then
sat
down
again
i
sorry
i
was
thinking
about
her
only
yesterday
what
the
matter
lady
adela
does
say
but
she
asks
about
you
the
duchess
i
mean
got
it
into
her
head
lady
adela
says
that
you
not
well
or
something
i
write
to
her
roddy
spoke
slowly
as
though
to
himself
i
not
treated
her
very
well
lately
and
she
always
been
such
a
brick
to
me
he
left
his
breakfast
walked
backwards
and
forwards
once
or
twice
always
been
such
a
brick
to
me
the
old
lady
has
he
repeated
lady
adela
really
did
want
lizzie
to
return
this
horrid
war
was
getting
on
her
nerves
the
house
was
all
in
disorder
and
nobody
seemed
either
well
or
happy
somebody
really
does
want
me
thought
lizzie
with
a
certain
grim
satisfaction
but
she
was
terribly
restless
that
morning
she
could
settle
down
to
nothing
and
ended
by
walking
up
and
down
the
garden
paths
watching
the
pale
winter
light
cross
the
downs
in
sweeping
shadow
seeing
the
bare
branches
all
black
and
sharp
against
the
blue
distance
how
she
loved
life
and
how
at
every
turn
life
was
thrust
from
her
for
that
other
woman
there
inside
the
house
two
men
were
ready
eager
to
die
for
herself
in
all
the
world
no
one
cared
there
came
up
to
her
again
borne
as
it
were
on
the
sharp
winter
air
a
determination
to
drive
down
rachel
defences
the
very
sense
that
now
after
lady
adela
letter
she
must
shortly
return
to
london
hardened
her
resolution
before
breakfast
she
had
felt
that
she
did
not
care
now
quite
suddenly
she
was
determined
that
she
would
confront
rachel
and
drag
the
truth
from
her
how
much
did
rachel
care
was
rachel
already
involved
in
a
liaison
with
breton
and
at
that
thought
a
pain
so
fierce
clutched
her
heart
that
for
a
moment
she
could
not
see
and
the
garden
and
the
sky
mingled
like
coloured
smoke
before
her
eyes
suddenly
coming
to
the
end
of
the
garden
by
the
stone
gate
she
saw
that
a
strange
thing
had
happened
one
of
the
gryphons
perched
there
for
many
centuries
had
tumbled
to
the
ground
and
lay
in
the
path
beyond
the
garden
broken
into
two
pieces
the
storm
of
last
night
must
have
driven
it
down
but
what
had
broken
it
she
was
sorry
she
knew
how
deeply
attached
roddy
was
to
those
gryphons
she
remembered
his
pride
when
he
had
pointed
them
out
to
her
the
other
gryphon
looked
very
lonely
he
be
distressed
the
dead
leaves
on
the
path
were
trembling
over
the
broken
pieces
of
stone
and
whistling
in
little
excited
groups
above
it
just
as
though
they
are
glad
she
thought
she
and
rachel
had
a
very
amiable
conversation
at
luncheon
rachel
confessed
to
a
bad
night
lizzie
told
her
about
jacob
how
tiresome
of
him
to
come
and
bother
you
yes
i
could
sleep
and
he
was
very
restless
too
so
i
put
him
into
the
passage
it
was
after
six
i
meant
him
to
go
down
to
the
servants
hall
i
so
sorry
miss
rand
oh
he
did
worry
me
at
all
i
awake
that
appeal
was
in
rachel
eyes
more
than
ever
lizzie
saw
it
and
steeled
her
heart
i
must
know
she
thought
i
know
i
afraid
she
said
that
i
have
to
go
back
to
london
i
heard
from
lady
adela
this
morning
the
duchess
is
not
so
well
oh
rachel
caught
her
breath
oh
miss
rand
no
no
oh
i
hope
not
you
stay
i
her
colour
came
and
went
there
the
dance
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
without
you
and
she
went
on
more
desperately
catching
lizzie
eyes
and
evading
them
we
are
just
beginning
to
be
so
happy
here
my
husband
likes
you
so
much
i
do
hope
she
stopped
and
the
colour
left
her
again
her
hands
were
trembling
on
the
white
tablecloth
the
strangest
impulse
flooded
lizzie
breast
an
impulse
to
go
to
her
and
put
her
arms
about
her
and
kiss
her
and
let
her
there
and
then
unburden
her
heart
lizzie
drove
the
impulse
down
buried
it
her
eyes
were
cold
and
her
voice
hard
as
she
answered
i
so
sorry
but
i
think
i
go
i
ca
leave
lady
adela
if
things
are
really
difficult
i
come
this
afternoon
shall
i
and
we
might
go
over
the
dance
rachel
had
been
thinking
she
looked
up
sharply
and
stared
at
lizzie
staring
as
though
she
had
been
some
stranger
whom
she
saw
for
the
first
time
yes
come
to
the
chinese
room
at
four
will
you
we
have
tea
up
there
yes
said
lizzie
at
four
they
were
both
of
them
aware
that
something
now
quite
irrevocable
had
been
settled
by
these
words
there
was
a
little
old
library
up
in
one
of
the
towers
and
there
lizzie
went
she
had
a
desperate
need
of
some
place
where
during
the
next
hour
she
might
think
and
decide
upon
some
plan
the
room
had
little
windows
that
looked
down
on
one
side
over
the
courtyard
and
on
the
other
over
the
garden
and
the
downs
the
shelves
went
from
ceiling
to
floor
and
were
filled
with
books
that
dimly
shone
with
their
old
gold
and
were
dusky
in
their
rich
faded
bindings
it
was
very
seldom
that
anyone
came
here
lizzie
was
quite
alone
as
perched
up
in
one
of
the
windows
she
looked
down
at
the
garden
saw
the
stone
gate
with
the
solitary
gryphon
watched
the
swiftly
fading
afternoon
light
fill
the
green
lawn
as
a
pot
is
filled
with
water
even
now
early
though
it
was
the
little
room
was
growing
dark
she
strove
now
resolutely
to
discipline
her
mind
although
the
very
thought
of
francis
breton
now
shamed
her
it
was
for
him
that
she
must
care
poor
dear
he
was
even
now
in
her
heart
foolish
indiscreet
must
plunge
from
one
mess
into
another
needs
someone
oh
so
dreadfully
to
help
him
out
her
hostility
to
rachel
did
not
prevent
her
from
feeling
that
here
was
someone
very
young
terribly
inexperienced
most
unhappily
impulsive
the
very
last
in
the
world
to
prevent
breton
from
having
another
catastrophe
as
bad
as
the
early
ones
she
must
know
absolutely
what
it
was
that
he
and
rachel
were
doing
and
only
rachel
could
tell
her
that
and
here
her
feeling
about
rachel
was
compounded
of
the
strangest
mixture
of
anger
and
suspicion
of
tenderness
and
compassion
of
sympathy
and
hard
callous
indifference
oh
lizzie
thought
why
has
all
this
come
to
me
why
was
i
allowed
just
to
go
on
with
my
life
as
it
was
my
life
that
was
so
safe
and
sure
and
dull
she
was
conscious
as
she
sat
there
that
she
was
listening
for
something
she
felt
in
an
odd
way
that
the
day
had
been
a
direct
continuance
of
the
dream
that
she
had
had
in
the
night
all
the
morning
she
had
been
aware
that
her
ears
in
spite
of
herself
had
been
waiting
for
some
sound
a
message
or
an
arrival
she
sat
now
in
the
swiftly
darkening
room
as
though
she
had
been
told
that
someone
was
coming
at
such
and
such
an
hour
and
she
had
heard
the
clock
strike
and
was
listening
for
the
grating
of
the
wheels
on
the
cobbles
of
the
courtyard
the
calm
winter
day
passed
now
into
a
purple
twilight
lights
were
coming
in
the
windows
she
thought
she
heard
a
step
in
the
passage
and
was
startled
as
though
someone
had
been
suddenly
unexpectedly
within
the
room
she
opened
the
window
and
listened
someone
several
people
will
come
down
that
garden
path
in
a
minute
i
know
they
will
but
the
air
was
very
cold
and
she
closed
the
window
even
as
she
did
so
a
clock
struck
four
she
got
up
and
went
to
rachel
iii
the
chinese
room
was
so
called
because
its
walls
were
covered
with
a
stiff
golden
chinese
paper
it
had
wide
windows
looking
on
to
the
garden
rachel
used
it
a
great
deal
lizzie
fixed
upon
her
mind
very
deliberately
all
the
details
of
her
surroundings
rachel
was
dressed
in
black
with
red
round
her
throat
and
her
waist
and
this
brilliant
colour
made
her
face
seem
white
and
there
were
deep
heavy
black
marks
under
her
eyes
she
looked
up
when
lizzie
came
in
seemed
with
a
violent
effort
to
compel
control
they
sat
there
for
some
time
and
discussed
the
dance
the
dusk
filled
the
room
then
tea
was
brought
there
was
a
light
in
their
corner
slowly
the
rest
of
the
room
grew
dark
they
finished
tea
it
was
taken
away
and
lizzie
sitting
quite
close
to
rachel
on
a
little
sofa
that
had
a
window
just
behind
it
was
aware
that
again
in
spite
of
herself
her
ears
were
straining
for
some
sound
the
house
and
all
the
world
were
profoundly
still
when
the
servant
had
at
last
left
them
alone
rachel
said
miss
rand
you
must
go
away
aunt
adela
can
manage
for
another
week
after
all
she
did
promise
that
you
should
stay
for
me
over
the
ball
why
did
you
ask
me
here
lady
rachel
lizzie
said
her
speech
was
a
direct
challenge
and
instantly
when
she
had
spoken
she
knew
that
they
had
entered
upon
those
personal
relations
that
they
had
during
all
these
weeks
feared
i
asked
you
because
i
wanted
you
for
a
friend
i
no
friend
no
woman
friend
whom
i
can
trust
i
knew
that
i
could
trust
you
i
hoped
that
you
could
help
me
i
been
here
for
some
time
now
and
you
have
told
me
nothing
no
because
you
have
held
me
off
have
shown
me
so
plainly
that
you
disliked
and
distrusted
me
you
did
always
dislike
me
what
have
i
done
that
only
my
way
as
i
told
you
this
morning
lady
seddon
i
not
an
emotional
person
but
i
feel
more
than
i
show
i
would
like
to
help
you
if
you
will
let
me
rachel
leaned
forward
and
caught
first
lizzie
arm
then
her
hand
then
she
spoke
her
voice
quivering
as
though
she
were
forcing
upon
herself
the
most
intense
control
oh
you
so
strange
so
odd
i
do
know
what
you
feel
whether
you
care
but
these
last
months
have
been
so
hard
for
me
that
even
though
you
hate
me
despise
me
it
does
matter
nothing
matters
if
only
i
can
get
away
from
myself
you
so
different
so
dry
so
hard
but
you
are
you
are
just
as
hard
she
stopped
lizzie
drew
her
hand
away
please
do
tell
me
things
if
you
feel
about
me
like
that
it
been
my
fault
has
it
that
we
do
get
on
did
ask
to
come
here
to
know
you
let
me
go
let
me
go
back
do
bother
about
me
leave
me
alone
she
at
last
brought
out
but
rachel
said
more
urgently
no
do
go
now
even
though
you
care
even
though
you
hate
me
help
me
i
no
one
else
if
only
you
knew
the
things
i
suffered
these
past
weeks
how
i
hated
myself
for
my
indecision
for
my
weakness
and
shame
i
do
know
why
i
feel
as
though
you
were
the
only
person
to
whom
i
could
talk
i
being
driven
i
suppose
by
this
long
silence
and
then
you
so
absolutely
to
be
trusted
even
though
you
dislike
me
you
straight
all
through
always
known
that
at
lizzie
heart
again
now
that
strange
confusion
of
sensation
and
with
it
a
sure
conviction
that
fate
had
this
scene
between
them
in
hand
and
that
events
now
whatever
the
hours
might
bring
forth
were
beyond
her
control
yes
you
may
trust
me
she
said
drily
i
useful
at
any
rate
for
that
lizzie
watched
her
as
in
the
little
pause
that
followed
rachel
struggled
for
concentration
and
for
the
point
of
view
that
would
make
the
strongest
appeal
lizzie
grimly
knew
was
the
thing
for
which
the
girl
was
struggling
and
it
yielded
her
the
pleasanter
irony
because
she
was
herself
so
surely
aware
of
that
one
fact
that
all
rachel
confessions
contained
for
herself
she
had
only
confidently
to
sit
and
wait
then
rachel
plunged
i
unhappy
she
said
in
my
married
life
miserably
unhappy
and
entirely
utterly
by
my
own
fault
i
tried
or
fancied
that
tried
i
done
what
i
thought
was
my
best
things
have
happened
now
at
last
that
have
made
it
impossible
i
ca
go
on
any
longer
she
spoke
as
though
she
were
very
urgently
endeavouring
to
deliver
a
fair
honest
statement
there
was
in
her
voice
a
note
that
showed
that
life
had
truly
of
late
been
very
hard
for
her
i
married
in
the
beginning
for
a
wrong
reason
i
knew
then
that
i
did
love
my
husband
i
married
because
i
wanted
to
escape
i
had
always
hated
my
grandmother
and
she
had
always
hated
me
you
knew
that
miss
rand
everyone
who
had
anything
to
do
with
us
knew
it
she
had
done
more
than
hate
me
she
had
made
me
frightened
frightened
of
life
and
people
someone
came
along
who
was
kind
and
easy
and
comfortable
and
everyone
said
it
would
be
a
good
thing
and
so
i
not
because
i
loved
him
but
because
i
wanted
to
escape
from
my
grandmother
married
him
because
i
had
to
silence
everything
that
was
honest
in
me
i
paying
now
it
was
all
quite
natural
lizzie
said
most
women
would
have
done
the
same
it
was
horrible
from
the
beginning
i
found
that
i
had
not
escaped
from
my
grandmother
at
all
she
had
arranged
the
marriage
and
now
was
always
and
in
some
curious
way
influencing
it
i
soon
saw
what
i
had
done
that
i
had
been
false
to
myself
and
therefore
false
to
everything
else
my
husband
was
in
love
with
me
he
was
very
patient
and
good
to
me
but
i
found
that
everything
that
i
did
or
thought
or
said
in
connection
with
my
husband
was
false
what
made
it
so
hard
was
that
i
was
and
i
am
very
fond
of
him
my
training
the
training
of
all
our
family
had
always
been
to
learn
how
to
be
sham
so
that
one
real
self
never
appeared
all
one
life
it
ought
to
have
been
easy
enough
but
i
never
been
like
one
of
my
family
i
always
been
different
i
had
determined
that
this
year
i
would
do
my
duty
to
roddy
but
harder
than
any
determination
can
govern
it
bad
for
roddy
deadly
for
me
at
last
things
have
happened
that
have
made
it
impossible
for
me
i
made
up
my
mind
this
morning
i
must
leave
roddy
let
him
divorce
me
give
him
a
better
chance
with
someone
else
she
spoke
with
the
desperate
immediate
determination
of
youth
staring
in
front
of
her
her
hands
clenched
like
flame
at
lizzie
heart
leapt
this
knowledge
she
and
breton
are
going
only
you
can
stop
them
she
and
breton
do
you
think
said
lizzie
a
little
of
your
husband
i
thinking
of
him
all
the
time
it
for
his
sake
that
he
should
have
a
better
chance
with
someone
who
cared
no
that
is
true
said
lizzie
it
because
you
love
someone
else
rachel
with
her
head
down
whispered
yes
it
because
someone
else
francis
breton
yes
francis
breton
that
whisper
of
his
name
had
in
it
confidence
worship
defiance
all
these
things
were
torture
to
lizzie
sitting
there
very
composed
very
stern
very
quiet
should
have
been
able
to
say
that
name
with
just
that
precious
intimacy
and
she
saw
in
rachel
eyes
beyond
her
trouble
the
glad
pride
that
the
pronouncing
of
the
name
had
given
her
you
know
rachel
asked
at
length
yes
you
known
a
long
time
yes
a
long
time
oh
if
you
only
spoken
to
me
all
this
time
i
been
wanting
you
to
you
have
known
yes
i
knew
then
lizzie
brought
out
slowly
letting
her
grave
eyes
wander
over
rachel
face
you
yourself
insisted
on
telling
me
you
have
brought
it
upon
yourself
if
i
say
what
i
must
rachel
caught
the
hostility
yes
she
said
sharply
i
older
than
you
older
in
every
way
you
know
so
little
yet
the
harm
that
you
can
do
you
must
leave
francis
breton
alone
lady
seddon
rachel
laughed
of
course
i
knew
that
you
that
it
was
the
kind
of
way
that
you
must
look
at
it
but
do
you
see
we
got
past
all
that
first
stage
it
is
in
the
very
least
any
good
looking
at
it
from
any
general
point
of
view
it
simply
the
individual
happiness
of
the
three
of
us
my
husband
francis
breton
myself
it
better
for
all
of
us
that
i
should
go
no
not
better
for
francis
breton
rachel
moved
impatiently
he
he
and
i
can
judge
that
miss
rand
no
you
ca
you
too
young
you
do
know
i
have
a
right
to
speak
here
i
know
him
i
have
known
him
all
this
time
lizzie
broke
off
rachel
suddenly
looking
up
gazed
at
her
lizzie
fiercely
also
proudly
as
though
she
were
guarding
something
very
precious
that
they
were
trying
to
take
from
her
returned
her
gaze
all
this
time
rachel
said
slowly
you
known
him
of
course
at
saxton
square
then
as
though
the
revelation
had
suddenly
broken
upon
her
why
you
you
yes
said
lizzie
now
fiercely
indeed
hurling
back
at
the
girl
the
of
her
surprise
yes
it
odd
is
it
i
not
the
kind
of
woman
am
i
ever
to
care
for
a
man
or
to
have
a
man
care
for
me
to
have
any
feeling
or
desire
or
affection
but
it
is
not
so
strange
as
it
may
seem
i
love
him
every
bit
as
well
as
you
do
i
cared
more
patiently
perhaps
more
unselfishly
even
but
there
it
is
it
gives
me
the
right
nothing
more
surprising
than
that
on
this
special
circumstance
rachel
had
never
reckoned
feeling
it
now
blazing
there
before
her
the
way
that
she
was
to
deal
with
it
was
beyond
her
experience
in
an
instant
lizzie
rand
was
to
her
a
new
creature
always
she
had
seen
lizzie
patiently
with
method
with
discipline
putting
things
in
order
that
was
her
world
and
dominion
lizzie
had
appeared
to
rachel
to
stand
for
all
the
things
that
she
herself
was
not
rachel
had
often
envied
that
absence
of
emotion
that
security
from
impulse
and
passion
and
it
was
upon
that
very
security
that
rachel
had
wished
to
depend
it
was
that
that
had
driven
her
to
seek
lizzie
friendship
she
herself
so
unsure
so
caught
and
destroyed
by
powers
too
potent
for
her
resistance
had
looked
with
wonder
and
desire
upon
lizzie
safety
now
lizzie
rand
was
no
longer
lizzie
rand
she
was
of
rachel
number
she
might
as
easily
as
rachel
be
swept
whirled
away
after
death
and
destruction
but
there
was
more
than
that
there
was
the
realization
that
lizzie
must
hate
her
that
lizzie
was
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
whom
she
should
have
given
her
confidence
that
lizzie
would
fight
now
to
the
last
breath
in
her
body
to
keep
francis
breton
from
her
during
a
long
silence
they
sat
facing
one
another
the
little
room
was
now
nearly
dark
and
it
was
only
by
the
faint
pale
shadow
from
the
sky
beyond
the
window
that
they
could
catch
each
from
each
their
consciousness
of
their
new
relationship
it
was
during
that
silence
that
lizzie
was
again
aware
that
her
ears
were
straining
to
catch
some
sound
i
did
know
rachel
said
at
last
very
softly
it
must
seem
brutal
to
you
now
that
i
should
have
told
you
all
this
i
would
of
course
have
spoken
ah
you
need
mind
lizzie
said
grimly
he
never
seen
anything
of
it
you
must
never
give
him
any
reason
to
suspect
i
trust
you
for
that
no
one
in
this
world
knows
but
you
and
you
should
never
have
known
if
it
had
not
been
that
i
to
prove
my
right
to
interfere
perhaps
even
now
you
do
see
that
i
a
right
but
whether
i
have
one
or
no
you
got
to
reckon
with
me
now
and
got
to
reckon
rachel
answered
with
some
of
lizzie
own
fierceness
with
a
power
that
beyond
your
power
or
mine
or
anyone
do
you
imagine
that
we
all
of
us
have
tried
hard
enough
why
all
these
last
two
years
we
done
nothing
but
try
now
it
simply
stronger
than
we
are
if
roddy
she
went
on
speaking
now
more
slowly
had
forced
it
if
he
not
been
impatient
but
now
after
just
happened
it
right
it
is
fair
to
him
to
myself
to
any
of
us
that
things
should
go
on
as
they
are
i
thinking
lizzie
answered
quietly
simply
of
francis
breton
well
is
it
fairer
too
for
him
he
been
living
as
we
have
all
this
time
a
life
that
denying
all
his
own
self
better
than
being
false
to
that
life
may
be
hard
for
us
if
we
go
away
together
but
at
any
rate
it
will
be
honest
ah
that
just
shows
how
young
you
are
do
i
know
that
pursuit
of
truth
and
honesty
as
well
as
you
do
i
know
that
when
beginning
for
us
the
one
thing
that
seems
to
matter
is
exposing
ourselves
showing
ourselves
to
the
world
just
as
we
are
at
first
it
seems
such
an
easy
thing
just
round
that
corner
the
moment
coming
when
the
real
person
in
us
is
going
to
stand
up
and
proclaim
itself
just
as
it
is
fine
and
splendid
but
always
something
just
comes
in
the
way
and
stops
it
the
years
go
on
and
we
further
off
from
truth
than
ever
you
think
that
if
you
go
off
with
francis
breton
now
you
both
of
you
be
leading
suddenly
honest
brave
lives
before
the
world
i
tell
you
it
is
so
things
will
be
just
as
crooked
just
as
shadowed
issues
just
as
confused
it
will
be
worse
than
it
was
but
you
do
know
i
know
francis
breton
do
you
know
too
the
kind
of
man
that
he
is
do
you
know
that
he
as
weak
as
a
man
can
be
weaker
than
any
woman
ever
be
he
the
kind
of
man
who
must
have
society
to
bolster
him
up
if
the
men
of
his
world
are
supporting
him
then
he
as
good
as
gold
as
fine
as
you
like
let
them
leave
him
and
down
he
goes
all
his
life
the
world
been
down
on
him
and
that
why
he
been
down
lately
he
been
quiet
he
been
winning
his
place
back
soon
if
patient
they
all
come
round
him
again
but
let
him
go
off
with
you
and
he
done
finished
absolutely
utterly
everyone
will
say
what
we
expected
that
what
we
always
knew
would
happen
do
you
know
what
kind
of
effect
will
have
upon
him
do
you
know
of
course
you
do
it
will
break
him
up
his
old
life
abroad
creeping
from
place
to
place
will
begin
again
only
now
he
have
the
additional
knowledge
that
he
done
for
you
as
well
as
for
himself
it
will
be
the
end
utterly
the
end
of
him
and
i
who
love
him
will
not
let
it
be
lizzie
speech
had
roused
in
rachel
one
of
those
old
storms
of
anger
she
was
exerting
now
her
utmost
but
her
heart
seemed
bound
tight
with
some
cord
so
slender
that
one
movement
one
impulse
would
snap
it
then
she
saw
in
lizzie
now
only
moved
by
a
sense
of
jealous
injury
she
sits
there
knowing
that
i
taken
him
from
her
that
it
that
what
she
feeling
she
lost
him
she
forgive
me
for
that
but
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
quiet
and
controlled
that
is
so
rachel
said
it
wo
i
think
be
like
that
so
much
more
between
us
than
you
can
understand
there
all
our
early
life
not
that
we
were
together
but
we
seem
to
have
it
all
in
common
to
have
known
it
all
together
we
unlike
our
family
all
the
beaminsters
we
together
in
that
we
are
together
in
everything
but
lizzie
voice
went
on
so
coldly
with
such
assurance
that
with
every
word
the
flame
of
rachel
anger
climbed
a
little
higher
grew
stronger
and
steadier
there
another
thing
too
i
watched
you
more
than
you
know
no
no
man
no
man
in
the
world
will
ever
keep
you
altogether
something
i
ca
tell
you
what
it
is
there
something
in
you
that
demands
more
than
just
a
personal
relationship
like
that
perhaps
maternity
it
is
with
many
women
perhaps
it
a
great
cause
a
movement
of
a
country
but
i
know
with
certainty
that
you
will
never
love
breton
as
you
should
love
a
man
realization
will
never
be
the
thing
to
you
that
anticipation
and
retrospection
are
i
believe
if
you
were
to
lose
your
husband
now
you
find
that
you
loved
him
all
thoughts
of
francis
breton
would
go
at
that
because
at
the
very
heart
of
her
determination
burnt
the
knowledge
that
lizzie
words
were
true
rachel
control
was
abandoned
her
anger
leapt
you
think
you
know
you
think
why
why
you
do
know
me
at
all
you
ca
know
me
we
strangers
miss
rand
now
always
nothing
can
ever
make
us
friends
again
i
never
forgive
you
for
what
you
said
the
poor
creature
that
you
take
me
for
no
doubt
you
have
done
better
had
the
chance
been
yours
but
you
go
too
far
that
was
unfair
of
you
lizzie
said
very
low
you
may
say
to
me
what
you
please
that
of
no
importance
to
anybody
but
francis
happiness
his
success
that
is
more
to
me
than
anything
or
you
not
break
his
life
into
pieces
for
your
own
pleasure
there
are
more
important
things
than
your
personal
happiness
lady
seddon
they
were
both
standing
but
they
could
not
see
one
another
save
very
faintly
their
hands
and
faces
it
too
late
miss
rand
rachel
laughed
i
shall
write
to
him
i
myself
shall
tell
my
husband
there
is
nothing
that
you
can
do
they
stood
there
conscious
that
a
word
a
movement
on
either
side
might
produce
an
absurd
a
tragic
scene
lizzie
had
never
known
such
anger
as
the
passion
that
now
held
her
rachel
was
taunting
her
with
the
thing
that
she
had
missed
she
stood
there
before
the
world
as
the
woman
for
whom
no
man
cared
she
stood
there
with
the
one
human
being
who
mattered
to
her
on
the
edge
of
complete
disaster
nothing
that
she
could
do
could
prevent
it
and
the
woman
at
her
side
was
the
cause
a
sudden
sweeping
consciousness
of
the
things
that
it
would
mean
if
rachel
were
dead
flowed
over
her
her
heart
stopped
that
way
at
least
francis
breton
might
be
saved
the
room
dark
as
pitch
before
her
was
filled
now
with
a
red
glow
her
hands
clenched
were
ice
in
a
world
that
was
all
of
an
overpowering
heat
lizzie
never
afterwards
could
remember
what
then
exactly
happened
she
was
worked
to
a
pitch
of
anger
she
was
thinking
to
herself
what
would
be
a
way
anything
to
save
him
she
should
have
taunted
me
with
that
when
suddenly
exactly
as
though
someone
had
taken
her
brain
and
emptied
it
she
had
forgotten
rachel
had
forgotten
her
own
personal
injury
forgotten
her
anger
was
only
aware
that
with
every
nerve
in
her
body
on
edge
she
was
waiting
for
some
sound
like
an
answer
to
an
invocation
the
sound
through
the
closed
window
came
iv
she
must
have
made
some
startled
noise
because
she
heard
rachel
say
what
is
it
she
fled
to
the
window
and
opened
it
she
could
see
nothing
but
she
could
hear
as
she
had
known
all
day
that
she
would
hear
steps
stumbling
falling
heavily
upon
the
heavy
gravel
path
she
felt
rachel
hand
upon
her
sleeve
what
is
it
rachel
said
again
lizzie
what
is
it
both
women
were
seized
and
held
by
fear
their
feelings
for
one
another
were
lost
sunk
in
the
cold
shattering
sense
of
disaster
that
had
come
through
the
open
window
into
the
room
they
could
see
lights
now
and
figures
there
were
murmuring
voices
oh
lizzie
what
is
it
rachel
said
for
the
third
time
and
then
after
a
moment
roddy
lizzie
said
wait
there
it
may
be
nothing
i
see
do
you
come
for
a
moment
she
crossed
the
dark
room
and
opening
the
door
saw
peters
hurrying
down
the
passage
towards
her
his
face
was
in
complete
disorder
the
face
of
someone
who
throughout
his
life
has
had
only
one
kind
of
face
that
has
served
most
admirably
for
every
kind
of
occasion
suddenly
a
situation
has
arisen
for
which
that
face
will
serve
his
body
was
shaking
oh
miss
rand
the
master
lizzie
felt
rachel
follow
her
brush
past
both
of
them
down
the
passage
and
out
of
sight
an
accident
flung
from
his
horse
and
dragged
along
been
hours
on
the
hill
a
shepherd
found
him
is
he
dead
no
miss
not
dead
not
yet
thank
god
the
doctor
crane
from
lewes
we
caught
him
miss
most
fortunately
on
the
way
from
another
patient
he
downstairs
now
quick
peters
things
will
be
wanted
lizzie
passed
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
peters
behind
her
said
they
taken
sir
roderick
into
the
green
miss
so
as
not
to
have
to
go
upstairs
she
came
down
the
stairs
and
then
stood
waiting
in
the
hall
that
was
for
the
moment
deserted
but
the
house
wore
an
air
of
dismay
surprised
alarm
so
that
every
sound
was
of
momentous
import
somewhere
a
long
way
away
someone
perhaps
a
frightened
was
sobbing
the
hall
door
was
still
open
and
little
gusts
of
cold
wind
came
in
and
stirred
and
rustled
the
pages
of
some
illustrated
papers
on
one
of
the
tables
lizzie
went
to
the
door
and
closed
it
what
should
she
do
to
go
into
the
room
and
ask
whether
she
could
be
of
use
her
quarrel
with
rachel
had
made
any
movement
now
on
her
part
difficult
rachel
might
resent
her
presence
someone
came
into
the
hall
she
saw
that
it
was
the
doctor
he
stood
looking
about
him
as
though
he
were
searching
for
someone
and
lizzie
went
up
to
him
doctor
please
tell
me
i
staying
in
the
house
is
there
anything
anything
at
all
that
i
can
do
the
doctor
was
tall
thin
black
like
an
elongated
crow
ah
yes
no
i
think
there
is
nothing
for
the
moment
there
are
two
of
us
here
we
instantly
wired
to
london
and
the
london
men
should
be
here
if
they
catch
the
seven
in
an
hour
and
a
half
lady
seddon
is
with
her
husband
there
hope
oh
yes
i
think
sir
roderick
will
live
it
the
spine
that
damaged
he
seemed
to
realize
miss
rand
efficiency
this
was
no
ordinary
visitor
he
went
to
the
hall
door
and
opened
it
waiting
for
the
things
from
lewes
i
just
came
on
with
what
i
got
yes
the
spine
afraid
will
never
be
able
to
get
about
again
such
a
strong
fellow
too
there
nothing
i
can
do
nothing
anyone
can
do
for
the
moment
lady
seddon
taking
it
wonderfully
but
she
want
you
later
i
advise
you
to
get
some
quiet
in
the
next
hour
it
afterwards
that
they
need
your
help
lizzie
went
up
to
her
room
and
lay
down
on
her
bed
she
did
not
light
the
candles
but
lay
there
in
the
darkness
striving
to
compel
some
order
out
of
the
turmoil
that
rioted
in
her
brain
her
first
thought
was
of
roddy
roddy
had
always
been
to
her
the
supreme
type
of
animal
spirits
and
vigour
had
been
above
everything
else
what
he
stood
for
that
should
have
been
struck
down
like
this
the
cruelty
the
irony
of
it
much
better
that
he
should
die
than
be
compelled
to
lie
on
his
back
for
the
rest
of
his
life
anything
better
for
him
than
that
if
he
died
rachel
would
be
free
lizzie
faced
that
thought
quite
calmly
her
quarrel
with
rachel
seemed
to
be
now
very
very
long
ago
something
distant
and
remote
something
whose
very
conditions
had
been
torn
asunder
and
flung
aside
as
she
lay
there
tenderness
for
rachel
came
sweeping
about
her
she
must
want
someone
now
she
so
young
and
so
ignorant
never
had
any
crisis
like
this
to
deal
with
hard
for
this
to
happen
to
him
just
after
she
thought
those
things
that
must
be
terrible
for
her
oh
she
need
someone
now
something
reminded
lizzie
of
other
things
of
francis
breton
of
rachel
words
of
lizzie
anger
then
ah
but
that
all
so
long
ago
it
does
seem
to
count
there
are
things
more
important
than
all
of
that
what
will
she
do
now
perhaps
she
still
hates
me
wo
let
me
come
near
her
it
my
own
fault
after
all
i
kept
away
for
so
long
would
let
come
near
oh
but
she
must
have
someone
to
help
her
after
a
while
lizzie
thought
she
wo
be
practical
she
wo
know
the
things
that
ought
to
be
done
i
wait
a
little
and
then
i
go
then
she
slept
she
awoke
with
a
clear
active
brain
she
felt
as
though
she
could
be
awake
now
for
weeks
a
tremendous
energy
filled
her
she
left
her
room
and
at
the
turn
of
the
passage
met
a
man
whom
she
knew
for
cramp
one
of
the
most
famous
of
the
london
doctors
a
man
whom
she
had
sometimes
seen
with
christopher
at
the
portland
place
house
she
stopped
him
i
miss
rand
doctor
lady
adela
secretary
met
in
london
i
want
you
to
tell
me
how
i
can
help
he
shook
hands
with
her
eyeing
her
with
approval
why
yes
of
course
how
do
you
do
miss
rand
yes
you
just
the
sort
we
want
for
the
moment
lady
seddon
my
chief
anxiety
she
borne
up
splendidly
so
far
but
now
i
am
a
little
afraid
i
got
her
to
go
and
lie
down
would
you
go
to
her
miss
rand
just
be
with
her
a
little
and
let
me
know
if
anything
happens
sir
roderick
pretty
bad
i
afraid
he
live
i
think
afraid
will
never
run
about
though
again
lizzie
made
her
way
to
rachel
bedroom
she
paused
outside
the
door
this
was
the
very
hardest
thing
that
she
had
ever
in
all
her
life
had
to
do
if
rachel
were
to
repulse
her
now
it
would
surely
be
the
final
absolute
proof
that
she
was
of
no
use
no
use
to
anyone
in
this
whole
wide
world
she
knocked
on
the
door
and
went
in
who
that
it
i
lizzie
the
room
was
dark
but
she
saw
that
rachel
was
lying
on
the
bed
she
went
up
to
her
rachel
did
not
move
i
came
lizzie
said
to
see
whether
i
could
help
if
i
could
do
anything
rachel
said
nothing
if
you
rather
if
you
do
want
to
see
me
of
course
just
say
rachel
turned
over
and
lizzie
heard
her
say
i
did
it
i
wanted
him
it
was
my
fault
it
was
my
fault
lizzie
knelt
down
beside
the
bed
rachel
dear
you
must
think
that
it
was
nothing
to
do
with
anyone
but
you
can
help
him
now
rachel
he
want
you
he
need
you
now
as
he
never
wanted
anyone
rachel
gave
a
bitter
cry
her
hand
touched
lizzie
then
she
flung
up
her
arm
caught
lizzie
neck
drew
her
towards
her
put
both
her
arms
around
her
and
held
her
held
her
as
though
she
would
never
let
her
go

mrs

i
francis
breton
had
known
during
the
weeks
that
preceded
his
letter
to
rachel
torture
that
became
to
him
at
last
so
personal
that
he
felt
deliberate
malignant
agency
behind
its
ingenious
devices
at
first
it
had
seemed
that
that
wonderful
hour
with
rachel
would
satisfy
his
needs
for
a
long
time
to
come
he
had
only
when
life
was
hard
dull
colourless
monotonous
to
recall
it
to
see
again
her
movements
to
hear
her
voice
to
remember
to
the
last
and
tiniest
detail
the
things
that
she
had
said
to
feel
that
clutch
of
her
hand
upon
his
coat
and
instantly
he
was
inflamed
exultant
so
for
a
time
it
was
into
every
moment
of
his
daily
life
he
worked
this
scene
rachel
was
always
with
him
never
for
a
single
instant
did
he
doubt
that
in
some
fashion
or
another
she
was
coming
to
him
he
had
purchased
an
interest
in
some
little
business
that
had
to
do
for
the
most
part
with
candles
and
down
to
the
city
now
every
morning
he
went
the
candles
prospered
in
a
small
but
steady
fashion
and
he
found
them
of
a
more
thrilling
and
romantic
interest
than
he
would
once
have
believed
possible
he
had
always
known
that
he
had
a
business
head
and
now
that
his
life
was
equable
and
regular
he
was
astonished
at
the
useful
man
that
he
was
becoming
he
liked
the
men
with
whom
he
worked
he
found
that
some
of
his
friends
of
the
old
days
sought
him
out
he
was
assured
that
he
had
only
to
wait
for
the
death
of
his
grandmother
for
his
restoration
to
the
beaminster
bosom
he
was
during
these
first
weeks
tranquil
almost
happy
feeling
that
pont
and
the
rest
were
with
every
hour
passing
more
surely
from
his
world
nourishing
always
like
hoarded
treasure
his
consciousness
of
rachel
then
a
faint
a
very
faint
restlessness
crept
upon
him
the
repetition
of
those
precious
moments
was
growing
dry
from
the
very
frequency
of
their
recounting
came
impatience
his
assurance
that
she
would
ultimately
come
to
him
grew
chill
he
needed
now
something
more
tangible
and
gradually
there
grew
with
him
the
conviction
that
she
would
write
she
had
said
very
clearly
and
distinctly
that
she
would
not
but
if
she
cared
as
he
knew
that
she
did
then
this
silence
must
be
as
impossible
for
her
as
for
himself
his
state
of
mind
now
was
that
he
expected
a
letter
when
he
came
back
from
the
city
at
six
or
seven
he
expected
to
find
lying
there
on
the
green
tablecloth
the
letter
in
the
morning
his
man
appeared
with
a
jug
of
hot
water
in
one
hand
and
the
letters
in
the
other
there
one
of
those
tantalizing
mysterious
envelopes
must
be
the
letter
at
first
disappointment
was
reassured
with
oh
it
will
be
there
but
as
the
days
passed
and
the
silence
grew
the
torture
developed
now
after
that
first
search
in
the
morning
after
that
swift
sharp
glance
to
the
green
tablecloth
came
physical
pain
sickened
heavy
drooping
of
the
spirits
when
the
world
looked
one
vast
deserted
plain
of
monotonous
dullness
when
the
hours
and
hours
and
days
and
days
that
yet
remained
to
life
seemed
intolerable
in
their
dreary
multitude
he
would
go
to
bed
early
in
order
that
the
morning
letters
might
come
the
sooner
he
fled
home
from
the
city
his
heart
beating
like
a
drum
as
he
mounted
his
stairs
only
one
line
one
line
would
have
been
sufficient
it
needed
only
the
reassurance
that
she
thought
of
him
that
she
still
cared
a
short
letter
would
have
given
him
all
the
comfort
he
needed
the
need
for
some
sign
came
as
much
from
his
impatience
with
the
whole
situation
as
from
his
love
for
rachel
but
this
because
he
always
saw
himself
as
a
fine
coloured
centre
of
some
passionate
crisis
he
naturally
did
not
perceive
his
whole
idea
of
rachel
was
as
the
days
passed
increasingly
a
picture
that
was
far
enough
from
reality
on
the
one
side
rachel
on
the
other
side
his
restoration
to
his
family
now
as
he
waited
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
in
danger
of
losing
both
the
one
thing
and
the
other
there
was
nothing
that
so
speedily
drove
breton
to
frenzy
as
enforced
inaction
after
all
they
had
been
together
so
little
breton
was
cursed
with
his
imagination
all
his
instability
of
character
came
from
his
imagination
he
looked
ahead
and
saw
such
wonderful
events
he
knew
why
people
did
this
or
that
he
could
see
so
clearly
what
would
happen
did
he
act
in
such
and
such
a
way
he
traced
future
action
through
many
hazardous
windings
into
a
safe
fair
haven
and
for
the
sake
of
the
haven
embarked
on
the
preliminary
dangers
discovered
of
course
too
late
that
the
haven
was
a
dream
he
saw
rachel
now
sitting
alone
thinking
of
him
loving
him
forcing
herself
to
be
fair
to
her
blockhead
of
a
husband
feeling
at
last
that
she
could
endure
it
no
longer
and
so
writing
or
he
saw
her
falling
in
love
with
that
same
blockhead
forgetting
everyone
and
everything
else
in
all
of
this
his
grandmother
played
her
part
he
was
aware
that
behind
all
the
attraction
that
he
had
had
for
rachel
was
the
consciousness
that
he
was
a
rebel
against
the
duchess
they
were
rebels
together
that
he
knew
was
the
way
that
she
thought
of
it
he
was
aware
however
that
he
was
a
rebel
only
because
he
was
forced
to
be
one
let
his
grandmother
hold
out
her
old
arms
to
him
and
into
them
he
would
run
he
would
be
restored
to
the
family
horribly
he
wanted
it
the
spirit
with
which
he
had
returned
to
england
was
one
of
hot
vengeance
that
would
indeed
have
suited
the
finest
of
rachel
moods
but
that
spirit
had
he
knew
subtly
changed
here
then
with
regard
to
rachel
he
felt
a
traitor
would
she
come
to
him
why
then
he
would
do
anything
for
her
even
to
pulling
the
duchess
nose
but
if
she
would
not
come
to
him
why
then
he
would
rather
that
the
beaminsters
should
take
him
to
themselves
and
make
him
one
of
them
but
he
felt
although
he
had
no
tangible
arguments
to
support
his
feeling
that
the
old
lady
was
round
the
corner
she
knows
you
bet
all
about
things
what
i
give
for
just
one
talk
with
her
i
believe
we
be
friends
his
weakness
of
character
came
as
he
himself
knew
from
his
inability
to
allow
life
to
stay
at
a
good
safe
dull
level
dull
something
happen
before
evening
i
must
it
happen
and
then
he
would
go
and
do
something
foolish
london
excited
him
the
lighted
shops
the
smell
of
food
and
flowers
and
women
and
leather
and
tobacco
the
sky
signs
flashing
from
space
to
space
the
carts
and
omnibuses
the
shouts
and
cries
and
sudden
silences
the
confused
life
of
the
place
so
that
you
could
never
say
is
london
but
could
only
in
retrospect
say
ah
must
have
been
london
and
still
know
that
you
had
failed
to
grasp
its
secret
the
dirt
and
shabbiness
and
lack
of
plan
and
good
humour
and
crime
and
indecency
and
priggishness
its
life
many
things
out
of
all
this
glory
called
him
racing
women
drink
the
gutter
one
minute
the
stars
the
next
from
them
all
he
held
himself
aloof
because
of
rachel
and
rachel
meanwhile
perhaps
did
not
care
as
christmas
approached
he
became
utterly
obsessed
by
this
one
thought
that
he
must
have
a
letter
his
obsession
had
been
able
during
these
weeks
to
clutch
the
tighter
in
that
he
had
seen
nothing
of
lizzie
rand
throughout
the
autumn
he
had
encountered
her
very
seldom
ever
since
that
night
in
the
summer
when
he
had
taken
her
to
the
theatre
she
had
avoided
him
and
he
decided
that
she
had
been
shocked
at
his
confession
about
rachel
you
never
know
about
women
i
should
have
thought
that
would
have
shocked
her
but
there
it
is
you
never
can
tell
lizzie
had
been
very
good
for
him
he
missed
her
now
he
would
tackle
her
he
said
one
day
then
not
only
with
every
day
but
with
every
hour
the
torture
grew
he
avoided
christopher
because
christopher
might
see
things
his
work
faded
like
mist
from
before
him
he
could
not
sleep
but
lay
on
his
back
thinking
of
what
she
would
say
if
she
write
whether
she
were
thinking
of
him
how
she
found
his
own
silence
and
what
she
felt
about
it
then
he
heard
the
astonishing
news
that
lizzie
rand
had
gone
down
to
seddon
to
stay
at
first
he
thought
that
he
would
write
to
her
and
beg
her
to
find
out
for
him
all
that
she
could
as
to
rachel
mind
but
lizzie
avoidance
of
him
checked
him
there
if
she
had
been
shocked
at
his
just
telling
her
why
then
she
would
not
be
likely
to
help
him
now
no
that
would
not
be
fair
to
rachel
it
occurred
to
him
then
that
rachel
had
asked
lizzie
in
order
that
she
might
speak
of
him
have
with
her
someone
who
could
tell
her
about
his
daily
life
and
so
without
breaking
her
word
yet
be
in
some
kind
of
communication
with
him
soon
this
became
with
him
a
certainty
it
assured
him
that
her
patience
was
exhausted
and
that
she
would
forgive
and
more
than
forgive
a
letter
from
him
he
wrote
then
in
an
agony
would
have
snatched
it
back
again
and
yet
was
glad
that
the
post
had
taken
it
from
him
he
had
broken
his
word
and
shown
himself
for
the
miserable
poor
creature
that
he
was
she
would
never
trust
him
again
but
surely
now
she
would
write
were
it
only
to
dismiss
him
for
ever
he
waited
and
the
agony
once
again
grew
phantasmal
in
its
terrors
then
swiftly
came
word
first
that
roddy
seddon
had
been
flung
from
his
horse
and
was
hovering
between
life
and
death
then
that
he
would
not
die
but
paralysis
of
the
spine
always
have
to
lie
on
his
back
afraid
this
from
christopher
then
finally
this
note
seddon
court
near
lewes
sussex
dear
breton
i
have
to
come
up
to
london
next
tuesday
for
the
day
i
shall
return
here
that
same
evening
i
have
a
message
for
you
could
we
have
tea
together
that
afternoon
or
what
do
you
say
to
a
walk
in
regent
park
perhaps
we
could
talk
there
more
easily
i
meet
you
at
the
entrance
to
the
botanical
gardens
about
unless
i
hear
from
you
yours
sincerely
e
rand
ii
the
effect
upon
him
of
roddy
accident
was
indescribable
he
was
sorry
terribly
sorry
dreadful
for
a
man
whose
whole
interests
are
in
physical
things
to
be
laid
on
his
back
like
this
for
ever
surely
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
die
and
then
at
that
sober
thought
would
forsake
him
he
did
not
wish
seddon
to
die
but
around
the
possibility
of
it
always
turning
wheeling
his
mind
fluttered
he
did
not
know
what
lizzie
would
have
to
say
to
him
but
at
his
heart
he
expected
triumph
with
so
little
encouragement
he
would
wait
so
faithfully
it
was
a
cold
windy
afternoon
of
early
spring
and
up
to
the
gates
of
the
botanical
gardens
little
eddies
came
sweeping
twigs
and
dust
and
pieces
of
paper
tossing
under
a
grey
sky
beneath
branches
that
creaked
and
strained
breton
stood
there
impatiently
he
was
ten
minutes
before
his
time
this
biting
windy
world
took
from
him
his
confidence
a
dirty
little
brown
dog
walked
round
and
round
wagging
now
and
again
a
pessimistic
tail
there
at
last
she
was
coming
as
orderly
and
neat
as
ever
up
the
road
her
grey
dress
her
little
shining
shoes
her
hair
that
no
breeze
could
disturb
her
expression
as
though
she
were
ready
for
anything
and
would
be
surprised
at
nothing
these
all
irritated
him
good
heavens
was
she
so
surely
tied
to
her
typewriter
that
she
could
understand
nothing
of
the
emotions
that
an
ordinary
human
being
might
be
feeling
had
she
no
imagination
because
she
had
never
herself
known
sentiment
about
anyone
alive
was
it
beyond
her
to
consider
what
others
might
encounter
breton
would
have
preferred
any
other
ambassador
in
this
affair
than
the
neat
efficient
miss
rand
forgetting
that
there
had
been
a
time
when
he
had
chosen
her
as
his
one
and
only
confidante
how
do
you
do
mr
breton
she
said
giving
him
her
little
gloved
hand
it
just
struck
i
was
a
little
early
he
answered
feeling
confused
and
hating
himself
for
his
confusion
let
go
round
to
the
left
here
and
turn
over
the
bridge
and
then
out
past
the
zoo
and
back
that
makes
quite
a
good
round
yes
he
said
i
chose
the
park
because
i
thought
that
we
could
talk
better
we
might
have
been
interrupted
at
home
he
caught
then
a
little
tremor
in
her
voice
and
was
grateful
for
it
she
feel
a
little
that
this
was
important
for
him
she
sympathized
perhaps
more
than
he
should
have
expected
let
come
straight
to
the
point
miss
rand
he
said
you
have
a
message
for
me
she
nodded
felt
in
the
pocket
of
her
dress
and
produced
an
envelope
which
she
gave
him
she
thought
it
better
that
i
should
give
it
you
like
this
because
then
i
could
say
something
as
well
something
she
had
asked
me
to
say
his
hand
trembled
as
he
saw
the
writing
on
the
envelope
francis
breton
saxton
square
during
what
months
and
months
he
had
longed
for
that
handwriting
and
how
often
had
he
imagined
that
letter
lying
just
as
it
lay
now
in
his
hand
he
read
it
lizzie
walking
gravely
at
his
side
this
letter
is
not
easy
to
write
and
you
must
realize
that
and
forgive
me
if
i
have
not
put
things
properly
these
last
weeks
have
all
made
such
a
demand
on
me
that
i
tired
out
i
said
once
francis
dear
that
i
would
not
write
to
you
until
i
meant
to
come
to
you
now
i
have
broken
my
word
this
is
to
tell
you
that
everything
anything
that
we
have
felt
for
one
another
must
be
ended
now
and
for
ever
do
think
that
i
am
angry
with
you
for
writing
to
me
perhaps
i
should
have
been
but
i
understood
only
now
all
my
life
must
be
always
entirely
devoted
to
my
husband
that
is
now
all
that
i
live
for
i
feel
as
though
in
some
way
i
had
been
responsible
for
the
disaster
at
any
rate
his
bravery
and
pluck
are
wonderful
and
it
is
a
small
thing
that
i
can
do
to
make
his
life
as
easy
as
i
can
but
it
will
take
the
whole
of
me
perhaps
after
a
time
we
shall
meet
one
day
be
friends
i
look
ahead
or
look
back
i
only
know
that
i
am
now
absolutely
entirely
my
husband
do
hate
me
for
this
it
was
taken
out
of
our
hands
asked
lizzie
rand
to
give
you
this
she
knows
everything
and
it
would
make
me
happy
to
think
that
you
two
had
become
great
friends
they
had
crossed
the
little
bridge
left
behind
them
the
strange
birds
that
chattered
beneath
it
and
had
passed
into
the
wide
green
spaces
often
given
up
to
cricket
or
football
now
empty
of
any
human
being
the
zoological
gardens
a
deserted
bandstand
a
fringe
of
trees
on
which
the
first
tiny
leaves
were
showing
above
them
the
grey
sky
had
broken
into
blue
and
white
the
cloud
shaped
with
ribs
and
fleecy
softness
like
a
huge
wing
stretching
above
them
from
horizon
to
horizon
over
the
two
of
them
so
tiny
on
that
broad
expanse
this
wing
brooded
tenderly
gravely
breton
had
crushed
the
letter
in
his
hand
and
stood
looking
in
front
of
him
but
seeing
nothing
his
one
thought
was
that
he
had
been
brutally
treated
she
had
simply
without
a
thought
without
a
care
flung
him
aside
he
had
of
course
known
that
this
accident
to
her
husband
must
for
a
time
hold
her
but
now
in
this
fashion
she
had
passed
on
without
hesitation
leaving
him
anywhere
anyhow
was
it
so
long
ago
that
she
had
said
to
him
that
whether
she
came
to
him
or
no
she
would
always
love
him
had
she
already
forgotten
that
kiss
that
moment
when
she
had
clung
to
him
held
to
him
he
stood
there
filled
with
this
restraint
this
all
done
for
her
and
now
all
useless
it
was
not
wanted
was
not
wanted
had
she
only
preserved
some
relationship
told
him
to
wait
assured
him
that
he
meant
something
to
her
anything
but
this
but
there
was
greater
pain
at
breton
heart
than
thought
of
rachel
brought
him
to
every
man
comes
in
due
time
the
instant
of
revelation
it
had
flashed
before
breton
now
he
saw
that
his
relationship
with
rachel
was
at
an
end
utterly
however
he
might
delude
himself
that
in
his
soul
he
knew
there
had
been
a
moment
when
they
had
met
and
the
moment
had
passed
but
he
saw
more
than
this
he
saw
that
he
was
a
man
to
whom
life
had
always
been
a
succession
of
moments
moments
flashing
stinging
flying
gone
he
always
helpless
to
grasp
and
hold
had
he
on
that
day
been
strong
held
rachel
conquered
her
made
her
his
he
was
weak
through
the
fine
things
in
him
as
surely
as
through
the
base
his
ideals
forced
his
purpose
to
tremble
as
often
as
his
regrets
standing
there
he
faced
himself
and
saw
that
whether
for
good
or
evil
life
for
him
had
always
been
evasive
fluid
a
thing
grasped
at
but
never
caught
rachel
was
not
for
such
as
he
lizzie
had
watched
him
and
her
face
had
grown
very
tender
i
know
i
a
nuisance
just
now
she
said
it
has
naturally
been
a
very
pleasant
thing
for
me
to
have
to
do
but
i
thought
that
i
could
tell
you
a
little
about
her
i
seen
her
through
all
of
this
he
strode
along
fiercely
his
eyes
staring
in
front
of
him
he
looked
she
thought
like
a
boy
who
had
been
forbidden
some
pleasure
she
found
it
difficult
to
keep
pace
with
him
she
so
very
very
young
lizzie
went
on
i
expect
you
forget
that
she
filled
above
everything
else
with
a
determination
to
express
her
own
individuality
a
protest
you
know
against
its
having
been
squashed
by
her
family
anything
that
helps
her
to
express
it
she
seizes
on
you
helped
her
she
seized
on
you
now
all
her
heart
is
stirred
by
this
disaster
to
her
husband
the
most
active
person
she
ever
known
absolutely
helpless
so
now
that
has
seized
her
she
ca
have
two
things
in
her
mind
at
once
that
where
her
troubles
come
from
she
cares
for
you
you
always
be
something
to
her
that
no
one
else
can
ever
be
and
oh
it
so
much
better
so
much
much
better
than
if
you
gone
off
made
a
mess
of
it
all
spoilt
all
your
beautiful
ideas
of
one
another
the
thrill
in
her
voice
made
him
even
though
he
was
intensely
concerned
with
his
own
wrongs
and
losses
consider
her
what
lizzie
rand
was
this
it
flung
him
back
almost
against
his
will
as
though
he
hated
to
throw
over
all
the
ideas
he
had
formed
of
her
to
that
first
meeting
when
they
had
stood
at
the
window
and
looked
out
on
the
grey
square
and
he
had
called
it
the
pool
then
he
had
suspected
her
of
emotion
and
sentiment
it
was
afterwards
when
he
had
made
her
his
wise
counsellor
and
adviser
that
he
had
thought
of
her
as
unemotional
he
felt
now
that
he
had
been
treating
her
rather
badly
he
stopped
abruptly
and
looked
down
at
her
there
was
something
in
her
earnest
gaze
at
him
something
rather
nervous
and
hesitating
that
did
not
belong
at
all
to
the
efficient
miss
rand
it
good
of
you
miss
rand
to
have
come
and
given
me
this
note
i
finding
it
all
rather
difficult
at
the
moment
as
i
sure
understand
i
better
go
off
somewhere
by
myself
a
bit
i
think
but
it
was
good
of
you
he
broke
off
and
stared
desolately
about
him
he
was
not
very
far
from
tears
she
thought
she
too
remembered
their
first
meeting
she
had
found
him
melodramatic
then
a
little
insincere
now
she
knew
that
she
had
been
wrong
he
was
sincere
as
a
child
is
sincere
the
world
was
utterly
black
was
transcendently
bright
as
it
was
for
a
child
she
understood
him
so
well
so
much
better
than
rachel
she
knew
that
neither
he
nor
rachel
would
ever
have
had
the
wisdom
to
endure
that
romantic
impatience
that
was
in
both
of
them
they
would
have
been
fighting
in
a
week
but
i
should
know
how
to
deal
with
him
the
green
park
and
the
brooding
sky
seemed
to
join
in
her
tenderness
she
had
never
loved
him
so
surely
so
unselfishly
as
she
loved
him
now
tell
me
he
said
gruffly
i
wrote
to
her
did
she
tell
you
anything
about
that
yes
lizzie
answered
i
do
know
what
might
have
happened
if
he
had
had
the
accident
but
as
it
is
i
know
she
glad
you
wrote
she
likes
to
look
back
on
it
but
it
on
something
that
died
gone
altogether
and
it
much
much
better
so
to
you
he
said
it
may
be
so
only
because
through
these
weeks
i
got
to
know
her
so
well
strange
unlike
any
other
woman
i
known
her
great
charm
is
that
she
so
unattainable
men
will
always
love
her
for
that
and
sometimes
she
may
think
she
loves
them
in
return
but
no
man
will
ever
call
the
woman
out
of
her
if
she
were
to
have
a
child
perhaps
that
would
but
we
all
of
us
you
i
christopher
her
husband
all
of
us
who
love
her
will
always
love
her
without
quite
knowing
why
and
without
in
the
end
her
belonging
to
any
one
of
us
i
grown
to
love
her
during
these
last
weeks
and
i
thought
it
was
because
i
was
sorry
for
her
and
admired
her
pluck
but
it
is
that
really
it
simply
because
well
because
there
something
wonderful
in
her
that
is
for
any
of
us
well
you
been
very
kind
miss
rand
i
sha
forget
it
you
said
just
the
thing
to
put
it
all
straight
and
clear
i
would
do
anything
now
to
disturb
her
or
hurt
her
husband
poor
devil
it
must
be
hell
for
him
and
it
do
anyway
matter
much
what
happens
to
me
it
never
has
done
you
been
a
brick
if
you
really
care
to
bother
about
a
rotten
waster
like
myself
i
be
proud
and
thank
you
he
took
her
hand
and
shook
it
and
then
was
gone
striding
off
furiously
towards
the
trees
she
walked
slowly
back
to

place
that
winter
the
duchess
was
not
so
well
no
evasions
whether
above
or
below
stairs
could
conceal
the
harsh
truth
the
duchess
was
not
so
well
to
the
bewildered
mind
of
lady
adela
the
horrid
succession
of
disasters
that
the
winter
had
provided
no
other
years
could
equal
it
had
all
begun
she
often
fancied
from
the
day
of
rachel
coming
out
from
the
ball
or
even
although
for
this
she
could
not
find
a
real
excuse
from
that
visit
to
the
bond
street
picture
gallery
it
was
on
that
afternoon
lady
adela
well
remembered
that
there
had
first
come
to
her
those
strange
treacherous
thoughts
about
her
mother
that
had
afterwards
as
they
had
grown
stronger
and
more
formidable
changed
life
for
her
yes
it
had
seemed
that
with
rachel
appearance
before
the
world
disaster
to
the
beamister
house
had
appeared
also
her
mother
illness
the
war
perpetual
rumours
of
rachel
unsatisfactory
marriage
the
uncomfortable
presence
of
frank
breton
the
horrible
disaster
to
poor
roddy
how
they
trooped
before
lady
adela
eyes
finally
more
terrible
than
all
of
them
was
the
complete
destruction
of
the
old
fiction
the
old
terror
the
old
submission
lady
adela
did
not
now
dare
to
look
into
her
mind
because
of
the
horrible
things
that
she
found
there
roddy
accident
had
had
the
most
terrible
effect
upon
the
duchess
only
christopher
could
really
tell
how
her
grace
had
taken
it
but
throughout
the
house
it
was
understood
that
the
effect
of
it
had
been
serious
would
give
her
long
now
said
norris
what
with
this
war
and
what
not
she
was
goin
as
it
was
and
now
sir
roderick
as
was
always
as
you
might
say
her
pet
having
this
awful
disaster
no
give
her
long
adela
of
course
saw
nothing
of
her
mother
feelings
she
never
had
been
allowed
to
see
anything
of
them
and
she
was
not
allowed
now
the
old
lady
was
outwardly
as
she
had
ever
been
although
she
spoke
less
and
if
you
watched
her
you
could
see
sometimes
that
her
hands
were
shaking
she
used
paint
for
her
cheeks
and
she
rouged
her
lips
her
love
of
fantastic
things
had
grown
very
much
and
on
the
little
table
behind
her
chair
there
was
a
row
of
strange
china
animals
and
some
indian
dolls
with
wooden
limbs
that
jangled
when
you
touched
them
but
adela
was
no
longer
afraid
of
her
mother
stimulate
it
as
she
would
force
upon
herself
her
sensations
of
the
days
when
she
had
been
afraid
as
she
did
still
the
terror
would
not
now
confront
her
there
had
been
a
dreadful
scene
when
the
duchess
had
been
told
that
her
daughter
was
acting
on
the
same
committee
as
bronson
the
dazzling
american
a
terrible
scene
but
adela
had
come
through
it
without
a
tremor
it
had
not
affected
her
at
all
it
is
that
i
changed
much
either
i
just
as
nervous
of
other
things
i
just
the
same
coward
perhaps
it
was
a
little
that
the
war
had
altered
one
values
so
many
beaminster
necessities
were
not
quite
so
necessary
certainly
john
felt
the
same
and
the
one
consolation
to
adela
through
all
this
horrible
time
was
that
she
had
grown
nearer
to
john
than
she
had
ever
been
to
anyone
john
and
she
had
been
attacked
by
the
real
world
both
of
them
at
the
same
moment
and
they
did
find
comfort
at
this
terrifying
crisis
in
being
together
but
all
adela
energy
was
directed
towards
concealing
from
her
mother
that
there
was
any
change
at
all
she
must
think
that
things
are
just
the
same
exactly
the
same
she
must
ever
know
that
well
that
she
could
not
put
it
into
words
her
grace
illness
was
never
alluded
to
by
any
member
of
the
household
there
came
word
at
the
beginning
of
march
that
roddy
had
been
moved
up
to
london
that
rachel
had
taken
a
little
house
in
york
terrace
overlooking
regent
park
that
roddy
was
wonderfully
cheerful
suffered
pain
at
times
but
was
on
the
whole
marvellous
two
or
three
days
after
this
news
when
christopher
arrived
at
on
his
usual
morning
visit
lord
john
met
him
in
the
hall
i
say
come
in
here
a
minute
he
said
leading
the
way
into
his
own
little
lord
john
was
fatter
scarcely
now
as
rubicund
as
shining
as
he
had
been
as
neat
and
clean
as
ever
but
there
were
lines
on
his
forehead
and
in
his
eye
that
glance
of
surprise
that
had
always
been
there
had
advanced
into
one
of
alarm
what
the
devil
is
life
going
to
do
what
horrible
trick
is
it
up
to
next
he
seemed
to
say
look
here
christopher
he
brought
out
when
the
door
was
closed
there
the
devil
and
all
to
pay
my
mother
declares
this
morning
that
she
going
to
pay
a
visit
to
roddy
well
christopher
seemed
amused
but
good
heavens
john
was
aghast
she
has
stirred
out
of
her
room
for
thirty
years
she
she
it
kill
her
oh
no
it
wo
christopher
answered
not
if
she
really
means
to
do
it
of
course
she
ca
walk
much
she
wo
have
to
we
can
get
her
downstairs
and
roddy
room
in
york
terrace
is
on
the
ground
floor
we
have
to
see
she
does
catch
cold
she
have
to
choose
a
warm
day
she
says
she
going
this
afternoon
said
lord
john
still
overwhelmed
by
this
amazing
development
well
wo
do
any
harm
are
you
sure
quite
sure
the
danger
with
your
mother
has
always
been
to
stop
her
inclinations
indulge
all
the
time
if
you
can
let
her
say
what
she
wishes
do
what
she
wishes
if
you
were
to
carry
her
out
of
doors
against
her
will
why
it
would
do
a
great
deal
of
harm
indeed
but
if
she
wants
to
go
she
see
that
she
up
to
it
it
may
be
the
best
thing
for
her
she
could
have
gone
out
heaps
of
times
in
the
last
thirty
years
if
she
wished
to
lord
john
rubbed
his
forehead
it
a
great
relief
to
hear
you
say
that
christopher
i
did
know
how
we
were
going
to
get
out
of
it
she
was
so
determined
this
morning
he
broke
off
you
it
wo
do
any
harm
he
said
again
i
sure
said
christopher
there
something
lord
john
went
on
again
dreadfully
on
my
mind
she
seems
to
feel
that
in
some
way
or
other
she
was
responsible
for
his
accident
i
ca
get
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
and
of
course
she
wo
tell
me
she
never
tells
me
things
perhaps
you
can
get
at
it
i
saw
rachel
yesterday
yes
she
very
fair
about
it
all
must
be
having
a
very
hard
time
she
was
glad
to
see
me
i
think
but
he
added
a
little
wistfully
i
never
been
anything
to
her
since
her
marriage
she
just
seemed
not
to
want
me
after
that
and
i
been
a
good
deal
to
her
before
when
one
getting
old
christopher
we
old
bachelors
we
begin
to
notice
that
nobody
wants
us
very
much
christopher
looked
at
him
yes
john
beaminster
had
changed
in
the
last
year
had
he
himself
he
wondered
also
changed
yes
he
said
smiling
but
i
been
an
old
bachelor
beaminster
for
years
and
years
and
i
see
no
likelihood
of
your
ever
being
one
you
get
younger
with
every
year
i
believe
this
accident
to
roddy
john
said
slowly
as
though
he
were
thinking
it
all
out
has
upset
us
all
it
seems
so
terrible
happening
to
him
much
worse
for
him
and
then
rachel
but
look
here
i
know
you
got
to
go
up
to
my
mother
i
wo
keep
you
a
minute
but
a
thing
i
got
to
talk
to
you
about
it
been
on
my
conscience
now
for
ages
i
not
known
what
to
do
at
last
i
made
up
my
mind
john
beaminster
had
made
up
his
mind
to
do
something
that
he
hated
to
christopher
perhaps
more
than
to
anyone
else
in
the
world
this
was
a
revelation
of
the
most
vital
the
most
moving
interest
he
had
known
john
for
so
long
seen
him
struggling
behind
screens
and
curtains
hugging
to
himself
the
happy
knowledge
that
to
the
very
end
he
would
be
able
to
keep
life
from
getting
at
him
and
now
behold
life
got
at
him
wag
clutching
him
by
the
throat
it
about
frank
at
last
he
desperately
brought
out
i
made
up
my
mind
i
must
go
and
see
him
now
perhaps
whilst
mother
is
is
still
suffering
from
the
effects
of
roddy
accident
it
would
be
wise
perhaps
to
have
him
here
actually
in
the
house
but
something
must
be
done
adela
agrees
adela
agrees
well
if
the
old
woman
upstairs
christopher
was
moved
as
he
had
lately
been
often
moved
by
a
swift
stirring
of
pathos
you
see
this
war
has
upset
us
all
so
has
made
one
feel
differently
and
then
he
really
does
seem
to
have
changed
been
as
quiet
as
anything
all
this
time
and
i
hear
that
he
working
at
something
sensible
down
in
the
city
i
must
go
and
see
him
then
they
had
heard
christopher
knew
of
any
rumours
about
rachel
and
francis
perhaps
there
no
rumours
perhaps
only
in
the
mind
of
the
old
lady
but
then
let
john
say
a
word
to
her
about
this
visit
to
breton
and
out
she
would
come
with
it
all
yes
beaminster
christopher
said
of
course
i
delighted
it
just
what
i
hoped
would
happen
but
perhaps
as
your
mother
has
been
rather
upset
lately
it
would
be
just
as
well
to
say
nothing
to
her
quite
so
john
looked
away
out
of
the
window
poor
john
christopher
held
out
his
hand
and
john
took
it
and
for
a
moment
they
stood
there
then
christopher
went
upstairs
ii
dorchester
no
longer
asserted
that
her
mistress
was
better
than
she
had
ever
been
since
that
terrible
morning
when
christopher
had
broken
the
news
of
sir
roderick
accident
dorchester
had
made
no
pretence
about
anything
this
was
the
time
that
must
she
had
always
known
one
day
arrive
but
what
she
had
not
known
was
that
it
would
be
quite
like
this
she
was
a
woman
of
some
imagination
moreover
were
there
one
person
in
the
world
who
touched
her
heart
then
was
it
her
mistress
she
had
penetrated
she
thought
some
of
the
strange
secrets
and
fantasies
of
that
old
woman
soul
and
it
seemed
that
now
in
these
later
days
she
was
at
last
in
touch
with
every
motive
and
grim
artifice
that
her
mistress
adopted
but
no
since
that
terrible
day
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
dorchester
had
lost
touch
was
left
bewildered
at
a
loss
as
though
she
were
suddenly
in
the
service
of
some
stranger
she
had
known
that
nothing
more
terrible
could
happen
to
her
mistress
than
this
when
she
heard
it
she
said
to
herself
this
will
kill
her
bound
to
she
had
known
too
that
her
mistress
would
not
flinch
outwardly
and
that
to
the
ordinary
observer
there
would
be
no
sign
but
the
thing
for
which
she
had
not
been
prepared
was
this
silence
a
silence
so
profound
and
yet
so
eloquent
that
one
could
obtain
from
it
no
clue
could
discern
no
visible
wound
but
daily
almost
hourly
as
she
sat
there
change
was
at
work
she
was
dying
before
their
eyes
what
dorchester
did
not
know
was
that
the
duchess
had
been
aware
for
a
long
time
that
this
was
to
occur
if
not
exactly
this
why
then
something
like
it
all
through
that
autumn
she
had
sat
there
waiting
the
war
the
rebellion
of
her
children
it
only
needed
that
disaster
should
overtake
roddy
and
the
circle
was
complete
she
did
not
doubt
that
it
was
because
he
had
married
rachel
that
this
had
happened
to
him
and
she
might
have
prevented
his
marriage
to
rachel
had
she
wished
the
girl
had
now
for
her
sitting
there
in
her
room
the
fatal
inevitability
of
some
hostile
spirit
she
saw
all
her
past
years
as
a
duel
with
this
girl
the
one
soul
in
rebellion
against
hers
rachel
had
taken
everything
from
her
she
had
first
stirred
adela
and
john
into
rebellion
she
had
encouraged
francis
breton
she
had
destroyed
roddy
she
rose
before
the
old
woman
eyes
black
titanic
sweeping
with
great
dark
wings
across
the
horizon
the
duchess
did
not
in
so
many
words
state
that
rachel
had
flung
her
husband
from
his
horse
and
then
watched
whilst
his
body
was
dragged
along
the
stones
but
in
some
way
the
girl
had
plotted
it
the
old
woman
had
indeed
during
these
last
months
suffered
from
visions
there
were
days
when
her
brain
was
as
clear
as
it
had
ever
been
and
on
these
days
she
thought
more
of
roddy
than
of
rachel
ached
to
be
with
him
longed
to
comfort
him
and
make
life
bearable
for
him
cursed
whatever
fate
it
was
that
had
ordained
that
upon
him
of
all
people
such
a
burden
should
have
fallen
then
there
were
other
days
when
the
old
china
dragons
seemed
more
real
than
dorchester
when
shapes
and
sizes
altered
in
an
instant
when
the
cushion
at
her
feet
was
swollen
like
a
mountain
when
she
seemed
floating
through
space
looking
down
upon
houses
cities
mountains
when
only
like
a
jangling
chain
upon
which
everything
hung
ran
her
hatred
of
her
granddaughter
on
such
a
day
if
rachel
had
come
to
her
and
she
had
been
alone
with
her
she
would
have
wished
the
dragons
to
devour
her
would
have
urged
the
silver
indian
snake
on
the
little
black
table
to
have
strangled
her
on
such
a
day
she
would
sit
hour
after
hour
and
wonder
what
she
could
do
to
her
granddaughter
it
was
upon
one
of
her
clear
days
that
it
flashed
upon
her
that
she
would
go
and
see
roddy
beyond
the
actual
excitement
of
visiting
roddy
there
was
the
determination
to
show
the
world
what
she
still
could
do
doubtless
they
were
saying
out
there
that
she
was
bedridden
now
ill
helpless
dying
even
well
she
would
show
them
for
thirty
years
she
had
not
been
outside
her
door
now
because
she
wished
it
she
would
go
she
said
nothing
to
adela
about
this
she
saw
adela
now
as
seldom
as
possible
she
told
john
on
the
morning
of
the
day
itself
on
that
same
morning
she
told
christopher
she
told
him
sitting
in
her
chair
with
her
cheeks
painted
and
her
white
fingers
covered
with
rings
i
going
to
pay
a
visit
this
afternoon
christopher
she
had
expected
opposition
she
was
a
little
disappointed
when
he
said
yes
so
i
already
heard
this
morning
i
think
it
an
excellent
thing
the
day
warm
you
have
to
be
carried
downstairs
you
know
you
and
norris
can
do
that
i
wo
have
anyone
else
very
well
i
shall
have
to
come
with
you
yes
you
can
talk
to
my
granddaughter
it
thirty
years
yes
the
last
time
was
old
judy
bonnings
reception
they
all
dead
all
of
remember
dorchester
yes
your
grace
very
well
dorchester
expressed
no
surprise
anything
was
better
than
that
silence
of
the
last
months
moreover
she
had
trusted
christopher
she
had
often
been
amazed
at
the
knowledge
that
he
showed
of
her
temperament
would
allow
her
temper
her
imperious
indulgence
one
day
and
on
another
would
control
them
absolutely
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
the
picture
that
she
presented
however
when
helped
downstairs
by
the
pontifical
norris
and
christopher
the
house
with
the
decorous
watchfulness
of
some
large
solemn
and
immensely
authoritative
policeman
surveying
her
descent
her
own
little
face
showing
nothing
but
a
fine
assumption
of
her
splendid
appearance
before
the
public
after
thirty
years
she
thus
once
again
was
saluted
by
portland
place
black
furs
of
lady
adela
surrounded
enfolded
her
and
from
out
of
them
her
eyes
haughtily
but
triumphantly
surveyed
a
two
small
children
with
their
nurse
a
messenger
boy
and
roller
the
coachman
to
roller
this
must
have
been
dramatic
moment
of
a
somewhat
undramatic
career
but
stout
and
imperial
upon
his
box
his
body
was
held
rigid
motionless
and
his
large
stupid
eyes
gazed
in
front
of
him
at
the
trees
and
the
light
march
sky
and
moved
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
she
was
placed
in
the
carriage
christopher
got
in
beside
her
and
they
moved
off
he
was
interested
to
see
the
effect
that
this
breaking
into
the
world
would
have
upon
her
he
felt
himself
a
little
in
the
position
of
showman
and
was
glad
that
he
had
a
spring
afternoon
of
gleaming
sunshine
and
a
suggestion
of
budding
trees
and
shrubs
in
the
portland
crescent
garden
to
provide
for
her
they
were
held
up
by
traffic
as
they
crossed
the
marylebone
road
drays
hansoms
bicycles
passed
there
was
a
stir
of
voices
and
wheels
somewhere
in
the
park
a
band
was
playing
he
looked
at
her
and
saw
that
she
paid
no
heed
but
sat
back
in
the
dim
shadow
her
eyes
he
thought
closed
she
was
at
that
instant
more
remote
from
him
and
all
that
he
represented
than
she
had
ever
been
curiously
he
was
moved
just
then
by
a
consciousness
of
her
personality
that
exceeded
anything
that
he
had
ever
felt
in
her
before
yes
she
must
have
been
tremendous
he
thought
and
then
he
wondered
of
what
she
was
thinking
so
quiet
and
yet
from
her
very
silence
sinister
and
then
how
could
he
have
not
considered
this
before
what
was
she
going
to
say
to
roddy
at
this
the
dark
carriage
was
suddenly
for
him
as
flashing
with
life
and
circumstance
as
though
it
had
been
the
florid
circle
of
some
popular
would
she
say
to
roddy
he
knew
her
for
the
most
selfish
of
all
possible
old
women
unselfish
only
perhaps
if
roddy
were
concerned
but
there
also
if
some
question
of
her
power
moved
her
ruthless
he
had
traced
the
windings
of
her
queer
intertwisted
brain
with
some
accuracy
he
knew
also
that
the
coloured
unreal
state
that
her
closed
fantastic
life
resembling
you
might
say
life
inside
a
chinese
puzzle
had
brought
upon
her
led
her
now
to
see
rachel
as
in
every
step
and
movement
of
her
day
she
would
not
wish
to
make
roddy
unhappy
she
might
persuade
herself
that
to
hint
to
him
of
rachel
infidelity
would
be
to
put
him
on
his
guard
she
might
say
that
it
was
not
fair
that
rachel
should
not
be
pulled
up
christopher
himself
could
not
tell
how
far
this
affair
with
breton
had
gone
during
that
short
time
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
crisis
that
had
been
building
up
around
him
here
there
for
months
for
years
perhaps
had
leapt
upon
him
and
that
in
some
way
he
must
deal
with
it
even
whilst
he
struggled
with
the
thoughts
that
were
sweeping
upon
him
now
from
every
side
they
were
at
the
house
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
carriage
he
felt
that
he
was
before
a
locked
door
that
the
safety
of
many
persons
depended
upon
his
opening
it
that
he
could
not
find
the
key
lady
seddon
was
out
sir
roderick
was
alone
the
duchess
was
half
assisted
half
carried
into
the
house
iii
the
duchess
feelings
were
indeed
confused
as
she
was
helped
into
roddy
room
placed
in
a
large
easy
chair
opposite
to
him
and
at
last
left
alone
with
him
enough
of
itself
to
disturb
her
was
the
fact
that
now
for
the
first
time
for
thirty
years
she
was
able
to
examine
some
room
different
from
her
own
a
large
high
room
with
wide
windows
that
displayed
the
park
sporting
prints
on
the
walls
antlers
over
the
fireplace
a
piano
in
one
corner
a
large
bowl
of
primroses
on
the
piano
some
and
two
old
swords
over
the
door
a
wooden
case
with
thin
rosewood
drawers
and
birds
eggs
in
gold
letters
upon
it
a
round
table
near
the
sofa
upon
which
roddy
was
lying
and
on
the
table
a
photograph
of
rachel
all
these
things
her
sharp
old
eyes
noticed
before
she
allowed
them
to
settle
upon
roddy
his
quiet
almost
humorous
well
duchess
set
quite
concisely
the
note
for
this
conversation
not
for
either
of
them
was
it
to
betray
any
consciousness
that
this
meeting
of
theirs
was
in
any
way
out
of
the
ordinary
formerly
it
had
been
the
ebullient
vigorous
roddy
who
had
brought
his
vigour
to
renew
her
fierce
old
age
now
that
old
age
must
be
brought
to
him
the
beaminsters
did
not
show
surprise
at
anything
at
all
had
she
come
from
her
grave
to
visit
him
he
would
have
greeted
her
with
his
quiet
well
duchess
his
life
was
broken
in
pieces
but
she
was
not
to
offer
any
comment
on
that
either
she
was
exhausted
even
by
that
little
drive
and
that
little
passage
from
door
to
door
so
she
just
lay
back
in
her
chair
for
a
little
while
and
looked
at
him
his
body
was
covered
with
a
rug
his
hands
still
brown
and
large
and
clumsy
were
folded
on
his
lap
he
was
wonderfully
tidy
brushed
and
cleaned
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
he
were
always
expecting
a
doctor
or
a
visitor
or
were
performed
upon
by
some
valet
or
other
simply
poor
dear
that
the
time
might
be
filled
his
cheeks
were
paler
of
course
and
his
face
thinner
but
it
was
in
his
eyes
his
large
simple
singularly
eyes
she
had
always
considered
them
that
the
great
change
lay
they
smiled
across
at
her
with
the
same
genial
good
temper
that
they
had
always
presented
to
her
but
indeed
she
could
never
call
them
again
roddy
seddon
had
grown
up
indeed
since
she
had
seen
him
last
she
knew
now
as
she
faced
the
experience
and
above
all
the
strength
that
those
eyes
now
presented
for
her
that
she
had
a
new
spirit
to
encounter
yes
he
had
had
a
horrible
time
but
she
was
wise
enough
at
that
instant
to
realise
that
the
horrible
time
had
drawn
character
out
of
him
that
she
at
least
had
never
for
an
instant
suspected
the
old
woman
was
moved
so
that
she
would
have
liked
to
have
tottered
to
his
sofa
to
have
caught
his
hands
in
her
old
dry
ones
to
have
kissed
him
to
have
smoothed
his
hair
but
she
sat
quietly
in
her
chair
recovered
her
breath
and
grimly
almost
saturninely
smiled
at
him
well
roddy
she
said
how
are
you
i
quite
splendid
play
patience
like
a
professor
can
knit
five
mufflers
in
a
week
and
am
learning
two
foreign
languages
but
indeed
how
rippin
to
see
you
here
i
spent
a
lot
o
time
on
this
old
sofa
wonderin
how
you
and
i
were
goin
to
see
one
another
have
you
she
was
pleased
at
that
well
you
see
i
managed
it
and
quite
easily
too
not
so
bad
after
thirty
years
my
roddy
you
of
all
people
to
tumble
off
a
horse
what
you
about
oh
it
was
simple
enough
roddy
eyes
worked
swiftly
to
the
park
and
then
back
again
i
was
worried
you
see
my
thoughts
were
wandering
and
the
old
mare
just
tripped
into
a
hole
pitched
and
flung
me
i
fell
on
a
heap
o
stones
knocked
the
sense
out
of
me
the
horse
was
frightened
and
went
dashin
along
with
me
tangled
up
in
her
all
came
of
my
thoughts
wanderin
but
you
know
duchess
i
had
heaps
of
accidents
heaps
and
heaps
every
kind
of
thing
has
happened
to
me
but
it
never
been
serious
always
the
most
wonderful
luck
well
for
once
it
left
me
poor
old
roddy
yes
it
old
roddy
i
can
tell
you
for
the
first
six
weeks
thought
i
simply
stand
it
had
serious
thoughts
of
kickin
out
altogether
seemed
to
me
everythin
had
gone
wonderful
though
the
way
you
pick
up
and
then
everyone
been
so
tremendous
and
as
for
rachel
he
heaved
a
great
sigh
her
eyes
half
closed
then
she
looked
very
carefully
at
the
photograph
on
the
little
round
table
that
a
good
photograph
of
her
you
got
yes
it
my
favourite
but
you
duchess
tell
me
about
yourself
you
must
be
in
magnificent
form
to
have
planned
this
great
adventure
she
told
him
about
herself
only
a
little
all
very
carefully
chosen
she
was
fancying
as
she
sat
there
that
she
was
again
playing
the
great
diplomatist
before
the
world
this
expedition
had
greatly
excited
her
it
had
fired
her
blood
and
just
now
she
felt
that
she
was
equal
to
taking
up
her
old
life
of
thirty
years
ago
playing
once
more
a
tremendous
part
beating
bronson
and
others
of
her
kind
straight
off
the
field
she
had
a
great
plan
now
of
coming
often
to
see
roddy
and
of
gaining
a
very
great
influence
over
him
she
did
not
say
to
herself
in
so
many
words
that
she
could
not
bear
to
think
of
him
lying
there
helpless
and
therefore
completely
in
rachel
power
but
that
is
what
in
reality
stirred
her
roddy
helplessness
the
sight
and
sound
of
it
drove
higher
that
flame
that
had
burnt
now
for
so
long
before
the
altar
at
which
rachel
was
one
day
to
be
sacrificed
she
may
come
and
go
as
she
pleases
he
lies
here
he
can
do
nothing
he
can
know
nothing
of
her
movements
he
in
her
hands
after
what
i
know
what
did
she
know
the
acquaintanceship
of
breton
and
dorchester
had
produced
the
fact
of
rachel
visit
of
letters
but
was
that
all
amongst
the
strange
mingled
visions
that
now
crossed
and
recrossed
her
brain
it
were
hard
to
say
what
were
real
and
what
phantasmal
but
granted
that
the
two
of
them
had
come
together
at
all
why
then
it
was
plain
enough
to
anyone
who
knew
them
that
only
one
result
was
possible
poor
roddy
poor
roddy
but
she
did
not
know
even
now
that
she
intended
to
tell
him
anything
her
sense
of
the
pain
that
that
revelation
would
give
to
him
held
her
but
as
the
minutes
passed
her
delight
at
being
back
once
more
in
this
gay
bustling
world
yes
she
liked
its
new
invigorating
noises
the
sense
of
power
that
she
had
and
youth
and
strength
spun
her
brain
to
finest
cobwebs
of
entanglements
she
was
glad
to
be
with
her
roddy
again
it
was
only
fair
that
helpless
as
he
was
there
should
still
be
someone
to
guard
and
protect
him
to
protect
him
yes
her
eyes
flashed
at
the
photograph
but
for
a
long
time
they
talked
in
precisely
their
old
fashion
the
war
friends
and
enemies
victories
and
defeats
marriages
and
deaths
roddy
seemed
for
a
time
the
old
roddy
and
then
gradually
through
it
all
there
pushed
towards
her
the
consciousness
that
he
was
doing
it
now
to
please
her
more
than
that
again
and
again
she
was
aware
that
some
bitter
jest
some
sharp
distraction
some
fierce
criticism
had
been
turned
by
him
deftly
aside
simply
rejected
with
a
deftness
and
a
strength
that
the
old
roddy
could
never
have
summoned
here
again
then
and
it
stabbed
her
there
in
the
midst
of
her
new
pride
and
confidence
was
a
reminder
that
her
power
her
sovereignty
had
vanished
was
roddy
also
to
be
beyond
her
influence
roddy
whom
she
had
had
at
her
feet
since
he
was
a
boy
of
sixteen
the
photograph
smiled
across
at
her
she
bent
forward
her
hand
raised
a
little
as
though
to
lend
emphasis
to
her
words
and
then
you
know
roddy
i
still
troubled
with
my
abominable
relation
what
breton
why
how
he
been
behaving
roddy
voice
was
scornful
oh
he
not
anything
that
i
know
of
but
he
always
there
so
tiresome
to
have
him
so
close
and
john
and
adela
have
grown
so
peculiar
lately
that
there
no
knowing
they
may
ask
him
in
to
tea
one
day
oh
no
they
wo
said
roddy
he
must
be
the
most
awful
outsider
i
wanted
to
speak
about
him
to
you
because
i
thought
you
might
give
a
word
of
warning
to
rachel
to
rachel
roddy
voice
was
amazed
yes
she
become
such
a
friend
of
his
surely
you
know
that
what
makes
it
so
difficult
for
me
when
one
own
granddaughter
rachel
a
friend
of
breton
but
i
did
know
she
ever
spoken
to
him
look
here
duchess
you
must
explain
i
thought
you
must
have
known
i
often
wished
to
speak
to
you
about
it
only
rachel
is
so
difficult
and
i
did
want
to
worry
you
and
it
seems
especially
hard
just
now
but
it
does
worry
me
not
a
bit
only
tell
me
how
do
you
mean
that
she
a
friend
of
his
only
that
she
goes
to
see
him
writes
to
him
goes
to
him
oh
yes
is
in
complete
sympathy
are
you
sure
absolutely
you
must
ask
her
i
will
of
course
he
lay
back
on
his
sofa
for
a
little
time
there
was
silence
between
them
she
was
filled
now
with
wild
regrets
she
wished
that
she
had
said
nothing
his
face
was
hard
and
old
she
wished
she
scarcely
knew
what
she
wished
she
only
knew
that
suddenly
she
was
tired
and
would
like
to
go
home
a
bell
was
rung
and
christopher
was
sent
for
she
would
like
to
have
kissed
roddy
but
only
wagged
her
bony
finger
at
him
now
be
a
good
patient
boy
and
i
soon
come
again
iv
meanwhile
five
minutes
before
this
rachel
had
come
in
she
was
told
of
the
visits
and
going
swiftly
to
the
little
upstairs
had
found
christopher
she
flung
her
arms
around
him
and
kissed
him
oh
dear
dr
chris
but
he
stopped
her
quick
rachel
i
may
only
have
a
minute
i
got
to
speak
to
you
instantly
she
drew
back
her
grave
eyes
watching
him
and
her
hands
as
of
old
nervously
moving
against
her
dress
what
is
it
it
just
this
the
duchess
may
ring
at
any
moment
she
been
with
him
a
long
while
look
here
rachel
she
knows
about
breton
that
been
to
see
him
that
you
written
to
him
she
told
you
yes
long
ago
but
never
mind
that
now
although
i
have
spoken
to
you
of
it
before
if
you
let
me
but
the
only
thing
that
matters
is
that
i
believe
i
ca
of
course
be
sure
but
i
believe
that
she
come
now
to
tell
roddy
rachel
drew
a
long
breath
oh
she
said
and
stiffly
standing
there
showed
in
her
eyes
the
pitch
of
feeling
to
which
now
her
grandmother
had
brought
her
christopher
went
on
urgently
i
been
praying
for
you
to
come
in
i
hoped
you
have
come
half
an
hour
ago
there
no
time
now
but
simply
this
rachel
dear
tell
roddy
everything
she
broke
in
passionately
you
know
it
all
right
chris
trusted
me
absolutely
he
said
gravely
but
it
simply
is
that
roddy
must
be
there
imagining
things
waiting
wondering
perhaps
he
wo
ask
you
perhaps
he
will
but
anyway
tell
him
tell
him
at
once
everything
the
bell
rang
he
went
across
to
her
kissed
her
and
then
went
downstairs
she
stood
there
waiting
without
moving
except
to
strip
off
very
slowly
her
black
gloves
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
door
she
heard
the
door
downstairs
open
the
stumbling
steps
once
she
caught
the
duchess
voice
and
at
that
she
drew
in
her
breath
then
the
hall
door
closed
but
for
a
long
time
afterwards
she
stood
there
without
moving
chapter
iii
roddy
moves
but
the
red
dwarf
although
as
malevolent
as
possible
found
that
his
had
no
effect
against
true
love
which
always
won
in
the
end
even
with
quite
stupid
people
fairy
i
it
would
have
been
quite
impossible
for
roddy
to
have
given
any
clear
description
of
his
experiences
since
the
event
of
his
accident
there
surely
like
a
gleaming
sword
that
cut
his
life
into
two
pieces
the
fact
itself
was
visible
enough
and
there
floated
before
him
again
and
again
the
casual
canter
the
especial
view
that
was
before
him
just
then
a
view
of
undulating
downs
somewhere
to
his
left
white
chalk
hollows
in
grey
hills
and
to
his
right
a
blue
strip
of
sea
the
wonder
that
was
in
his
mind
about
rachel
his
thoughts
chasing
back
over
all
the
incidents
of
their
life
together
then
suddenly
the
jerk
his
consciousness
of
falling
with
the
ground
rising
in
a
high
wall
to
oppose
him
and
then
darkness
after
that
there
was
nightmare
in
which
pain
and
rachel
rachel
and
pain
mingled
and
parted
were
confused
and
then
separate
and
with
them
danced
shapes
and
figures
sometimes
in
a
turmoil
that
was
horrible
sometimes
in
silence
that
was
the
most
terrible
of
all
clear
after
that
first
period
of
misty
confusion
was
the
day
when
he
was
told
his
fate
he
had
come
out
from
the
heart
of
the
more
terrible
pain
no
longer
had
he
to
lie
knowing
that
soon
after
another
minute
peace
agony
would
rise
before
him
like
a
creature
with
a
wet
pale
malignant
face
and
then
after
looking
upon
him
for
a
moment
would
bend
down
and
with
its
horrible
damp
fingers
would
twist
and
turn
his
bones
one
against
another
until
the
supreme
moment
came
when
nothing
mattered
and
no
agony
however
bad
could
touch
his
indifferent
soul
he
was
now
simply
weak
weak
weak
nothing
mattered
in
his
dream
he
fancied
that
someone
had
said
that
he
would
never
rise
from
his
back
again
for
days
after
that
it
lingered
far
away
from
his
actual
consciousness
really
it
had
not
mattered
something
this
dream
that
concerned
him
but
what
could
concern
him
except
that
people
should
keep
quiet
and
not
fuss
for
instance
he
loved
to
have
rachel
with
him
he
was
miserable
were
she
not
there
but
at
the
same
time
he
was
conscious
that
she
fuss
was
not
quite
like
miss
rand
but
of
this
thing
that
he
had
heard
he
thought
nothing
that
i
ought
to
think
about
i
do
know
it
is
one
day
when
i
stronger
i
look
into
it
there
came
a
day
when
he
stronger
a
day
late
in
january
of
a
pale
wintry
sun
and
watery
gleams
they
had
placed
his
bed
so
that
he
could
see
his
beloved
downs
and
the
little
road
that
ran
from
their
foot
out
into
the
village
on
this
morning
he
was
wonderfully
better
he
had
slept
well
breezes
and
pleasant
scents
came
through
the
open
window
geese
were
cackling
a
donkey
braying
made
him
laugh
silly
old
donkey
he
said
aloud
to
no
one
in
particular
then
he
was
aware
of
jacob
sitting
bunched
into
a
heap
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
his
brown
eyes
peering
anxiously
through
his
hair
at
every
sound
his
ears
would
rise
for
a
moment
but
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
roddy
the
dog
had
been
in
roddy
room
a
good
deal
during
these
last
weeks
had
been
wrenched
away
from
it
roddy
found
that
he
was
touched
by
this
devotion
jacob
apparently
cared
more
for
him
than
did
the
other
dogs
not
a
bad
old
thing
often
these
mongrels
are
more
human
but
lord
he
a
sight
the
nurse
was
sitting
sewing
by
the
window
roddy
lay
happily
thinking
that
now
at
last
that
jolly
bad
pain
really
seem
to
have
been
left
behind
he
was
immensely
wonderfully
better
it
would
not
be
long
surely
before
he
was
quite
fit
again
before
he
then
down
it
swung
swung
like
an
iron
door
shutting
all
the
world
away
from
him
inexorable
always
on
your
back
never
get
up
again
his
hand
gripped
the
nurse
yes
tell
me
am
i
dreaming
or
did
someone
say
something
the
other
day
about
about
my
never
being
able
well
to
toddle
again
you
know
i
afraid
thanks
he
closed
his
eyes
and
then
summoned
all
the
grit
and
determination
that
there
was
in
him
to
face
this
fact
he
could
not
face
it
it
was
as
though
he
were
struggling
up
the
side
of
a
high
slippery
rock
up
he
would
struggle
up
and
up
now
he
was
at
the
top
down
he
would
slip
again
it
could
not
oh
it
could
not
be
true
it
true
as
the
days
passed
grimly
in
silence
he
accepted
it
it
had
always
been
his
creed
that
in
this
world
there
was
no
place
for
the
maimed
and
the
halt
he
was
sorry
for
them
of
course
but
it
was
better
that
they
should
go
they
only
occupied
room
that
was
intended
for
lustier
creatures
well
now
he
was
himself
of
the
halt
and
maimed
that
was
ironical
was
it
indeed
he
would
much
rather
that
he
had
pegged
out
altogether
better
for
everybody
but
as
things
were
he
would
square
things
out
and
see
what
he
could
make
of
it
all
then
he
saw
as
every
day
he
grew
stronger
that
he
had
no
resources
everything
in
his
other
life
as
he
now
had
come
to
think
of
it
had
depended
upon
his
physical
strength
every
pleasure
every
desire
every
ambition
had
had
to
do
with
his
body
everything
except
rachel
in
his
other
life
half
his
happiness
arose
simply
from
the
sense
of
his
physical
movement
his
consciousness
that
as
the
rivers
flowed
and
the
winds
blew
and
the
sun
blazed
so
did
he
also
live
and
have
his
being
and
with
all
this
most
intimately
was
his
house
mingled
that
grey
building
and
he
grew
and
moved
and
developed
together
life
could
never
be
very
terrible
for
him
so
long
as
he
had
his
place
to
come
back
to
his
place
to
care
for
his
fields
and
his
gardens
his
horses
and
his
dogs
to
look
after
now
he
could
do
nothing
more
for
it
perhaps
one
day
he
would
be
wheeled
about
its
courts
and
paths
but
oh
with
what
pitying
eyes
would
it
look
down
upon
him
how
sorrowfully
his
gryphons
would
greet
him
with
what
memories
they
would
confront
him
he
could
not
bear
now
to
look
out
upon
the
downs
on
the
little
village
path
his
bed
was
moved
a
day
arrived
when
he
felt
that
it
was
all
really
more
than
he
could
endure
he
was
in
wild
furious
rebellion
surly
sometimes
in
raging
tempers
sometimes
sulking
from
day
to
day
he
cursed
all
the
world
even
christopher
could
do
nothing
with
him
then
upon
this
there
followed
a
period
of
silence
he
lay
there
and
beyond
yes
and
no
would
answer
no
one
his
eyes
stared
at
the
wall
christopher
feared
at
this
time
for
his
sanity
suddenly
the
silence
was
broken
he
must
go
to
london
because
he
could
not
endure
the
memories
that
this
place
thronged
upon
him
at
the
beginning
of
march
he
was
moved
to
the
house
in
york
terrace
ii
the
little
house
by
the
park
helped
him
to
construct
his
new
life
the
normality
that
there
was
in
roddy
the
same
balance
of
common
sense
fostered
his
recovery
he
was
not
going
to
die
life
would
be
an
infernal
trouble
were
he
always
to
be
in
rebellion
against
it
he
must
simply
make
the
best
of
the
conditions
and
then
after
all
he
had
rachel
rachel
had
been
a
heroine
during
this
time
and
to
his
love
for
her
he
now
clung
passionately
tenaciously
the
one
thing
left
to
him
out
of
his
great
catastrophe
she
seemed
during
these
months
to
have
thought
for
nothing
else
in
all
the
world
she
was
not
so
useful
in
a
sick
room
as
miss
rand
miss
rand
was
wonderful
but
there
were
certain
moments
when
she
would
bend
down
and
kiss
him
or
would
look
at
him
or
would
take
his
hand
when
he
wondered
whether
love
for
him
had
not
crept
into
her
heart
after
all
funny
when
he
had
gone
out
for
his
ride
on
that
eventful
morning
expecting
that
he
had
offended
her
for
ever
well
if
his
accident
had
won
rachel
for
him
it
had
been
worth
while
but
there
were
other
days
when
he
knew
for
a
certainty
that
it
was
not
so
knew
that
it
was
pity
that
moved
her
affection
too
perhaps
but
nothing
more
than
affection
nevertheless
he
hoped
that
this
might
be
the
beginning
of
something
else
he
would
lie
for
hours
looking
out
at
the
park
and
creating
visions
he
made
now
something
tolerable
of
his
life
people
showed
a
wonderful
kindness
and
there
was
always
someone
to
entertain
him
some
new
present
that
someone
had
sent
him
people
could
not
be
kind
enough
he
was
grateful
for
all
of
this
but
he
spent
many
many
hours
in
thinking
he
found
that
he
had
never
thought
before
he
found
that
he
would
have
gone
to
his
grave
without
thinking
had
not
the
great
catastrophe
occurred
he
thought
of
a
great
many
things
but
especially
of
what
other
lives
were
like
there
were
he
supposed
a
great
number
of
people
who
had
had
misfortunes
as
overwhelming
at
his
how
had
they
behaved
and
what
after
all
were
all
the
other
people
in
all
their
different
circumstances
doing
before
this
it
had
only
occurred
to
him
to
be
interested
in
the
people
who
were
leading
lives
like
his
now
he
wondered
about
everybody
little
things
became
of
the
greatest
importance
every
day
he
read
the
paper
with
absorbed
care
from
the
first
line
to
the
last
the
arrangement
of
the
room
interested
him
and
he
would
give
its
details
minutely
his
consideration
he
was
greatly
interested
in
gossip
and
he
would
chatter
happily
all
the
afternoon
did
someone
come
and
visit
him
to
everyone
it
was
an
amazing
thing
that
he
should
take
it
all
so
easily
no
one
had
ever
given
roddy
credit
for
the
strength
of
character
that
was
in
him
and
they
did
not
perhaps
recognize
that
his
earlier
impatient
condemnation
of
other
people
why
the
devil
do
the
feller
stand
up
to
it
like
a
man
made
him
now
conscious
that
he
was
himself
at
last
faced
with
a
similar
test
to
which
he
himself
must
stand
up
but
beyond
question
he
could
not
have
held
the
position
as
he
did
had
it
not
been
for
rachel
he
seemed
to
see
that
here
was
a
chance
of
seizing
her
and
making
her
really
his
own
a
chance
that
would
never
be
his
again
he
was
making
an
appeal
to
her
she
was
closer
to
him
he
thought
with
every
day
so
his
natural
humour
and
spirits
returned
at
present
life
was
tolerable
he
suffered
very
little
pain
and
he
was
aware
that
a
number
of
people
to
whom
he
had
never
meant
anything
whatever
now
cared
for
him
very
much
indeed
he
was
ashamed
when
he
heard
of
the
men
who
were
dying
and
suffering
for
their
country
he
would
have
had
to
have
gone
to
africa
he
told
himself
if
he
not
had
his
accident
then
enteric
or
a
bullet
and
to
rachel
altogether
iii
he
had
often
during
those
long
hours
thought
of
the
duchess
he
had
always
in
his
heart
considered
her
affection
for
him
strange
he
knew
that
it
was
difficult
for
her
to
be
patient
with
fools
and
he
knew
that
his
own
intellectual
gifts
were
on
no
very
high
level
he
based
her
friendship
for
him
on
the
naive
transparency
with
which
he
displayed
his
frankly
pagan
indulgences
his
love
for
rachel
and
this
accident
had
changed
all
that
he
was
still
pagan
enough
at
heart
but
there
were
other
things
in
his
world
principally
it
occurred
to
him
now
that
one
could
judge
about
the
way
things
looked
to
other
people
and
the
duchess
of
course
always
judge
if
they
did
look
her
way
why
then
wipe
them
out
he
had
in
fact
much
less
now
to
say
to
the
duchess
he
was
afraid
that
he
would
no
longer
agree
with
her
about
things
of
course
she
knows
the
world
and
is
a
damn
clever
woman
but
she
jolly
well
too
hard
on
people
who
are
quite
her
style
she
put
my
back
up
i
believe
if
she
talked
he
had
indeed
always
been
uncomfortable
at
the
old
approaches
to
sentiment
she
was
never
sentimental
with
other
people
he
sentiment
in
anyone
except
of
course
rachel
and
she
never
sentimental
he
looked
out
now
upon
the
road
that
ran
through
the
park
beyond
his
window
watched
the
nursemaids
and
the
children
the
old
gentlemen
the
girls
the
smart
women
and
the
pale
young
men
with
books
and
the
smart
young
men
with
shiny
hats
and
he
wondered
about
them
all
sometimes
when
the
grass
was
very
green
when
high
white
clouds
piled
one
upon
another
hung
above
the
pond
whose
corner
he
could
just
see
thoughts
of
his
little
grey
house
his
gardens
the
downs
his
horses
and
dogs
would
come
to
him
come
out
come
out
a
sparrow
would
dance
on
his
window
ledge
damn
you
i
ca
he
would
cry
and
then
his
eyes
would
fly
to
rachel
photograph
if
i
get
her
it
will
be
worth
it
wo
it
jacob
my
son
he
talked
continually
to
jacob
and
found
great
comfort
in
the
stolid
assurance
with
which
the
dog
would
wag
his
stump
of
a
tail
he
more
than
human
that
dog
he
would
tell
rachel
funny
how
i
never
used
to
see
anything
in
him
of
course
there
were
many
days
when
life
was
utterly
impossible
then
he
would
snap
at
everyone
lie
scowling
at
the
park
curse
his
impotence
his
miserable
degraded
infirmities
curse
it
to
die
in
a
ditch
like
this
to
be
broken
up
to
be
smashed
his
majestic
butler
now
the
tenderest
and
most
devoted
of
attendants
stood
these
evil
days
with
great
equanimity
bless
you
of
course
he
bound
to
be
wild
now
and
again
wonder
is
it
do
happen
more
often
it
does
him
good
to
curse
a
bit
so
things
were
with
him
until
the
day
of
the
duchess
visit
his
surprise
at
seeing
her
was
confused
with
an
assurance
that
she
had
come
for
something
after
her
departure
what
she
had
come
for
was
plain
enough
to
see
he
had
not
taken
her
words
about
breton
at
first
with
any
credulity
his
principal
emotion
at
the
time
had
been
anger
with
the
old
woman
a
great
desire
that
she
should
go
before
he
should
forget
himself
and
be
disgraced
by
showing
temper
to
anyone
so
old
and
feeble
but
when
she
had
gone
he
found
that
peace
had
left
him
now
once
and
for
all
he
knew
that
the
duchess
hated
rachel
and
he
was
ready
to
allow
for
the
bias
and
exaggeration
that
spite
would
lend
but
when
that
was
taken
away
much
remained
rachel
knew
breton
that
was
certain
she
had
never
told
him
name
had
occurred
sometimes
in
conversation
and
she
had
always
spoken
of
him
as
though
he
were
a
complete
stranger
rachel
knew
breton
and
she
had
never
told
him
he
might
tell
himself
that
she
had
not
told
him
because
she
knew
that
he
would
instantly
stop
the
acquaintance
it
was
of
course
simply
a
friendship
that
had
sprung
up
because
rachel
was
sorry
for
his
ostracism
roddy
thought
that
that
was
just
like
rachel
part
of
her
interest
in
anyone
who
seemed
to
be
unfairly
treated
yet
she
had
never
told
him
then
lying
there
all
alone
with
no
one
in
whom
he
could
confide
there
sprang
before
him
suspicions
if
she
had
known
this
scoundrel
of
a
cousin
of
hers
if
she
had
been
so
careful
to
keep
from
her
husband
all
cognizance
of
her
friendship
did
not
that
very
silence
and
deceit
imply
more
than
friendship
was
breton
the
kind
of
man
to
abstain
from
snatching
every
advantage
that
was
open
to
him
did
not
this
explain
rachel
avoidance
of
roddy
during
the
last
year
her
moods
of
restraint
repentance
her
sudden
silences
then
upon
this
came
the
thought
how
much
of
all
this
did
the
world
know
perhaps
it
was
true
once
again
that
the
husband
was
the
last
to
be
informed
perhaps
during
the
last
year
all
london
society
had
mocked
at
roddy
blindness
the
duchess
he
might
be
sure
had
not
spared
her
tongue
the
duchess
he
cursed
her
as
he
lay
there
and
then
wondered
whether
he
should
not
rather
thank
her
for
opening
his
eyes
then
cursed
himself
for
daring
to
allow
such
suspicions
of
rachel
to
gain
their
hold
upon
him
in
roddy
there
was
strong
beyond
almost
any
other
principle
a
sturdy
hereditary
pride
he
was
proud
of
his
stock
proud
of
his
ancestors
and
all
their
doings
worthy
and
unworthy
proud
of
his
own
pluck
and
standing
different
from
all
these
fellers
with
only
their
own
grandmothers
to
go
back
to
it
had
been
this
arrogance
with
other
things
somewhat
closely
allied
that
had
endeared
him
to
the
duchess
now
it
was
that
same
pride
that
suffered
most
terribly
here
was
some
disaster
hanging
over
his
head
that
threatened
most
nearly
the
honour
of
his
family
let
breton
touch
that
he
was
alone
on
that
evening
after
the
duchess
visit
rachel
had
gone
out
to
a
party
she
went
he
had
noticed
reluctantly
protested
again
and
again
that
she
wished
she
could
stay
with
him
seemed
to
hang
about
him
as
though
she
would
speak
to
him
looked
oh
too
adorably
too
adorably
beautiful
whilst
she
was
with
him
he
saw
behind
her
the
dark
shadow
of
breton
that
fellow
kicked
out
of
the
country
for
cheating
at
cards
or
something
as
bad
disowned
by
his
family
and
she
she
rachel
so
proudly
apart
could
have
gone
to
him
he
was
glad
when
at
last
she
had
left
him
then
lying
there
he
endured
three
of
the
most
awful
hours
of
agony
that
he
was
ever
in
all
his
life
to
know
nothing
that
had
come
to
him
through
his
accident
was
so
bad
as
this
at
one
moment
it
was
fury
wild
raging
unreasoning
fury
that
wished
that
rachel
and
breton
and
the
duchess
all
of
them
together
might
suffer
the
torments
of
hell
and
then
swiftly
following
it
came
his
love
of
rachel
nearer
now
to
burning
heights
so
that
he
swore
that
whatever
she
had
done
he
did
not
care
he
would
forgive
her
everything
but
all
that
mattered
was
that
she
should
be
spared
that
her
honour
should
be
vindicated
then
more
quietly
he
reflected
that
he
was
uncertain
of
everything
as
yet
he
had
only
that
malicious
old
woman
word
and
until
he
had
something
more
solid
than
that
he
must
trust
rachel
oh
if
only
she
would
of
her
own
accord
speak
if
she
would
only
sit
there
by
his
sofa
and
with
her
hand
in
his
tell
him
quite
simply
in
what
exactly
her
friendship
with
breton
consisted
ah
then
how
he
would
forgive
her
how
together
they
would
be
revenged
upon
the
duchess
if
she
did
not
speak
he
did
not
know
what
he
would
do
that
old
mouth
must
be
stopped
he
must
find
out
exactly
how
far
the
danger
had
spread
he
must
deal
with
breton
now
indeed
he
cursed
so
that
he
should
be
tied
to
this
sofa
there
had
swept
down
upon
him
the
hardest
trial
of
his
life
rachel
returned
from
her
party
she
sat
by
his
sofa
and
he
lay
there
looking
at
her
had
it
been
a
nice
party
not
very
one
of
those
war
parties
that
everyone
had
now
that
silly
lady
meikleham
recited
the
beggar
and
they
had
that
french
tenor
from
covent
garden
to
sing
patriotic
songs
and
of
course
they
got
money
out
of
everybody
there
been
nothing
for
supper
she
seen
nobody
amusing
she
broke
out
roddy
dear
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
you
look
as
white
and
tired
as
anything
has
that
pain
in
your
back
no

thank
you
i
i
had
gone
and
the
dinner
at
lady

was
so
stupid
monty

and
lord

so
dull
and
stupid
says
he
coming
to
see
you
afternoon
well

at
anybody

she
got
up
stood
over
him
for
a
moment
looking
so
tall
and
slender
so
dark
with
diamonds
in
her
black
hair
so
lovely
she
looked
down
upon
him
then
suddenly
bent
and
kissed
him
roddy
what
is
it
dear
he
caught
her
hand
so
fiercely
that
she
cried
roddy
dear
i
yes
oh
nothing
only

look
so
tired
i
wish
could
take
some
of
the
pain
there
is

i
wonderfully
lucky
peters
came
in
to
take
him
to
bed
she
kissed
him
again
and
left
him
looking
done
up

christopher
knowledge
of
rachel
long
and
intimate
though
it
had
been
had
never
made
him
sure
of
her
in
his
relations
with
his
he
proceeded
on
the
broad
lines
that
best
suited
he
felt
any
investigation
of
his
own
character
broad
lines
however
did
not
catch
that
subtle
spirit
that
was
rachel
he
had
been
baffled
again
and
again
by
some
fierceness
or
sudden
wildness
in
her
and
had
often
been
held
from
approaching
her
lest
by
something
too
impetuous
or
he
should
drive
her
from
him
altogether
he
had
been
aware
that
since
her
marriage
she
had
been
gradually
slipping
from
him
and
this
had
made
him
during
the
last
year
the
more
careful
how
he
approached
her
he
loved
her
the
more
in
that
something
that
was
part
of
her
was
strange
and
mysterious
to
him
the
idealist
and
the
poet
concealed
in
him
behind
his
frank
worldliness
cherished
her
aloofness
she
was
precious
to
him
because
nothing
else
in
this
life
had
quite
her
unexpected
beauty
since
that
afternoon
when
the
duchess
had
paid
her
visit
to
roddy
he
wished
many
times
that
he
were
a
cleverer
man
he
felt
that
something
must
instantly
be
done
but
he
felt
too
that
one
false
step
on
his
part
would
plunge
them
all
into
the
most
tragical
catastrophe
he
was
baffled
by
his
own
ignorance
as
to
the
real
truth
neither
breton
nor
rachel
had
taken
him
into
their
confidence
he
could
not
say
how
any
of
them
could
be
expected
to
act
and
yet
he
knew
that
something
must
be
done
at
once
he
saw
rachel
through
it
all
like
a
strange
dark
flower
mysterious
shining
with
her
colour
beyond
his
grasp
but
so
beautiful
so
poignant
she
had
never
appealed
to
him
as
now
in
the
heart
of
some
danger
that
he
could
not
define
she
eluded
him
and
yet
demanded
his
help
after
much
puzzled
thinking
he
decided
that
it
must
be
breton
whom
he
had
best
approach
and
so
he
wrote
and
asked
him
to
come
and
dine
quietly
with
him
in
harley
street
on
the
evening
of
march
breton
accepted
if
he
might
be
released
at
as
he
had
then
another
appointment
ca
stand
a
whole
evening
thought
christopher
thinks
i
want
to
bully
him
well
perhaps
i
do
he
was
detained
to
a
late
hour
on
that
afternoon
by
a
patient
in
halkin
street
and
it
was
after
seven
when
he
started
home
driving
through
piccadilly
and
bond
street
it
had
been
an
afternoon
of
intense
closeness
and
now
as
evening
came
down
upon
the
town
the
thick
curtain
of
grey
that
had
been
hanging
all
day
overhead
seemed
with
a
clanking
and
jolting
one
might
imagine
so
heavy
and
brazen
was
its
aspect
to
fall
lower
above
the
dim
grey
streets
the
lights
were
out
swinging
pale
and
distended
down
the
length
of
piccadilly
and
already
the
carriages
were
pressing
in
a
long
row
towards
the
restaurants
boys
were
crying
the
latest
editions
with
the
war
news
and
upon
all
those
ears
their
cries
now
fell
drearily
monotonously
for
so
long
had
the
town
been
filled
with
details
of
escape
folly
death
ignominy
that
it
was
tired
and
weary
of
any
voice
or
cry
that
concerned
itself
with
war
christopher
waiting
impatiently
for
his
carriage
to
move
on
thought
of
brun
this
oppressive
stifling
evening
seemed
to
call
in
some
manner
too
subtle
for
christopher
powers
of
expression
the
houses
the
streets
the
lamps
the
very
railings
into
some
life
of
their
own
under
the
iron
sky
that
surely
with
every
minute
dropped
lower
upon
the
oppressed
town
the
clubs
opposite
the
green
park
raised
their
hooded
eyes
and
stirred
ever
so
little
above
the
people
and
the
twisted
chimneys
watched
and
whispered
as
the
trail
of
carriages
wound
drearily
into
the
misty
distance
christopher
was
not
an
imaginative
man
but
he
thought
that
he
had
never
known
london
so
evilly
perceptive
it
grew
hotter
and
hotter
but
with
a
heat
that
made
the
body
perspire
and
yet
left
it
cold
a
dim
yellow
colour
that
seemed
to
herald
a
fog
that
had
not
made
up
its
mind
whether
it
would
appear
or
no
hung
at
street
corners
figures
seemed
furtive
in
the
and
instinctively
voices
were
lowered
as
though
some
sudden
sound
would
explode
the
air
like
a
match
in
a
room
a
bell
began
to
ring
and
startled
everyone
there
be
an
awful
thunderstorm
soon
thought
christopher
never
known
things
so
heavy
everyone
nerves
will
be
on
the
stretch
why
one
might
fancy
anything
his
own
brain
would
not
work
he
had
just
left
a
case
that
had
needed
all
his
sharpest
attention
but
he
had
found
that
it
was
only
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
he
could
keep
his
mind
alert
and
now
when
he
wanted
to
think
about
breton
he
was
continually
arrested
by
some
sense
of
apprehension
so
that
he
had
to
stop
himself
from
crying
out
to
his
driver
look
out
take
care
there
someone
there
when
he
got
to
his
house
he
found
that
his
forehead
was
covered
with
perspiration
and
that
he
could
scarcely
breathe
meanwhile
he
had
decided
nothing
as
to
the
course
he
would
pursue
with
breton
when
he
had
dressed
and
come
down
he
found
that
breton
was
waiting
for
him
how
ill
he
looks
was
christopher
first
thought
perhaps
breton
also
was
oppressed
by
the
weather
and
indeed
in
the
house
although
the
windows
were
open
it
was
stifling
enough
no
the
man
in
pieces
christopher
look
was
sharp
he
had
never
seen
breton
who
was
naturally
neat
and
a
little
vain
about
his
appearance
so
dishevelled
his
beard
was
untrimmed
his
eyes
bloodshot
his
hair
unbrushed
his
face
white
and
drawn
and
his
mouth
seemed
in
that
light
to
be
trembling
good
heavens
man
said
christopher
what
you
been
doing
to
yourself
breton
smiled
feebly
oh
nothing
do
badger
me
i
ca
stand
it
badger
you
who
going
to
badger
you
only
christopher
broke
off
looked
at
him
a
moment
then
put
his
hand
on
the
other
shoulder
look
here
old
man
why
have
you
left
me
alone
all
these
weeks
have
felt
like
seeing
anybody
well
you
might
have
felt
like
seeing
me
i
missed
you
i
got
so
many
friends
that
i
can
spare
so
easily
my
best
one
oh
rot
chris
breton
said
almost
angrily
you
know
it
only
the
kind
of
interest
you
got
in
all
lame
dogs
that
ties
you
to
me
at
all
you
an
ungrateful
sort
of
fellow
frank
but
no
matter
i
fond
of
you
in
spite
of
your
ingratitude
come
in
to
dinner
and
see
whether
you
can
eat
anything
on
this
stifling
night
it
stifling
but
oppressive
with
something
more
than
the
mere
physical
discomfort
of
it
it
was
a
night
that
worked
havoc
with
the
nerves
so
that
christopher
who
had
naturally
a
vast
deal
of
common
sense
found
himself
glancing
round
his
shoulder
irritated
at
the
least
noise
that
his
servant
made
expecting
always
to
hear
a
knock
on
the
door
breton
contributed
very
little
to
the
conversation
during
dinner
he
ate
almost
nothing
drank
only
water
looked
about
him
restlessly
muttered
something
about
its
being
strangely
close
for
march
crumbled
up
his
bread
into
little
heaps
when
they
were
back
in
christopher
breton
collapsed
into
a
deep
chair
lay
there
staring
desperately
about
him
then
with
a
jerk
pulled
himself
up
and
began
to
stride
the
room
swinging
his
arm
then
pulling
at
his
beard
crying
out
at
last
my
god
it
stifling
christopher
i
must
go
out
i
ca
stand
this
it
beyond
my
bearing
christopher
made
him
sit
down
again
and
then
feeling
that
he
could
not
more
surely
hold
the
man
than
by
plunging
at
once
into
what
was
in
all
probability
the
heart
of
his
trouble
said
look
here
frank
i
said
i
would
badger
you
and
i
wo
but
something
about
which
i
must
speak
to
you
you
must
tell
me
the
truth
there
more
involved
than
just
ourselves
breton
seemed
instantly
aware
of
christopher
meaning
he
sat
up
i
knew
he
said
that
i
was
in
for
a
lecture
well
it
ca
make
any
difference
no
christopher
answered
brusquely
whether
it
makes
any
difference
to
you
or
no
you
to
listen
frank
it
simply
this
i
happened
to
hear
a
good
time
ago
that
you
had
met
rachel
i
knew
that
she
had
been
to
your
rooms
i
knew
that
you
had
corresponded
i
should
dismiss
that
of
yours
frank
breton
muttered
something
you
might
have
told
me
yourself
frank
you
might
both
of
you
have
told
me
but
never
mind
it
all
too
late
for
that
now
the
point
is
that
it
was
your
grandmother
that
told
me
my
god
breton
cried
she
knows
she
knew
but
there
was
nothing
know
there
was
nothing
anyone
might
have
known
if
anyone
dares
to
breathe
a
syllable
against
one
of
the
purest
noblest
yes
yes
i
know
all
that
christopher
answered
but
the
thing
is
simply
this
i
do
know
she
does
know
exactly
what
the
truth
is
between
you
and
rachel
all
that
she
does
know
is
that
rachel
went
to
see
you
and
wrote
to
you
now
roddy
seddon
is
or
was
aware
that
his
wife
had
ever
met
you
he
holds
the
more
or
less
traditional
family
point
of
view
about
you
i
believe
that
two
or
three
days
ago
the
duchess
told
him
about
rachel
visits
i
am
not
sure
of
this
i
hope
that
by
now
rachel
herself
has
told
her
husband
but
of
that
also
not
sure
all
i
know
is
that
it
our
duty
your
duty
and
my
duty
to
save
rachel
all
the
unhappiness
we
can
and
still
more
to
save
roddy
remember
the
position
he
in
breton
sprang
to
his
feet
look
here
chris
i
should
have
told
you
of
all
this
long
ago
i
did
know
that
you
had
heard
i
wish
to
god
i
had
spoken
to
you
but
as
heaven
is
my
witness
rachel
is
a
saint
i
a
miserable
cur
a
misery
to
myself
and
a
misery
to
everyone
else
but
she
you
been
fools
the
couple
of
you
he
answered
sternly
it
no
use
cursing
now
i
wo
go
and
urge
rachel
to
tell
roddy
she
must
do
that
of
her
own
free
will
all
our
hands
are
tied
it
depends
upon
the
steps
that
roddy
takes
and
after
all
the
old
lady
may
never
have
told
him
but
i
warned
you
frank
it
up
to
you
to
do
the
right
thing
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
asked
breton
i
do
know
what
you
can
do
you
must
see
for
yourself
only
frank
here
christopher
voice
became
softer
by
all
our
old
friendship
and
by
any
affection
that
you
may
have
left
for
me
i
do
conjure
you
to
play
fair
by
rachel
and
her
husband
rachel
is
very
very
young
roddy
is
helpless
that
enough
breton
cried
my
god
christopher
of
you
could
realize
the
weeks
i
been
having
you
would
think
perhaps
so
badly
of
me
it
been
more
i
swear
than
any
mortal
flesh
can
endure
driven
driven
i
at
the
end
but
she
safe
from
me
safe
now
and
safe
forever
and
that
now
that
old
woman
should
step
in
now
christopher
came
and
again
put
his
arm
on
breton
shoulder
and
held
him
up
it
might
seem
with
more
than
physical
strength
his
affection
for
breton
was
an
affection
sprung
from
his
very
knowledge
of
the
man
weaknesses
he
had
in
him
that
british
quality
of
ruthless
condemnation
for
the
sinner
whom
he
did
not
know
and
sentimental
weakness
for
the
sinner
whom
he
did
he
had
seen
francis
breton
through
a
thousand
scrapes
he
would
see
him
doubtless
through
a
thousand
more
we
say
no
more
now
old
boy
you
look
done
up
i
wo
worry
you
but
if
you
want
me
here
i
am
and
i
promise
not
to
lecture
only
you
owe
me
some
confidence
you
do
indeed
breton
got
up
and
stood
there
with
his
hand
pressed
to
his
forehead
what
you
told
me
he
said
i
must
do
something
something
it
all
been
my
fault
if
they
should
touch
her
then
turning
to
christopher
he
said
you
the
only
friend
got
and
i
know
it
i
do
value
it
only
lately
i
been
going
to
bits
again
if
it
were
for
you
and
little
miss
rand
i
swear
i
have
gone
altogether
you
a
brick
christopher
another
day
i
come
to
you
and
tell
you
everything
i
simply
past
talking
a
servant
came
in
and
gave
christopher
a
note
it
was
from
lord
john
saying
that
he
was
anxious
about
his
mother
and
asking
the
doctor
whether
he
could
possibly
come
round
and
see
her
breton
then
said
that
he
must
go
he
went
promising
that
he
would
soon
come
again
when
he
had
left
the
house
christopher
stood
perplexed
wondering
whether
he
should
have
left
him
alone
then
he
put
on
his
hat
and
coat
and
set
off
for
portland
place
ii
breton
had
indeed
no
destination
he
had
been
frightened
of
a
whole
evening
with
christopher
he
was
frightened
of
everything
of
everybody
above
all
of
himself
he
found
himself
with
a
sense
of
surprise
as
though
he
were
the
helpless
actor
in
some
bad
dream
standing
in
oxford
circus
surely
it
a
dream
the
sky
grey
and
lowering
was
yet
tinged
with
a
smoky
red
he
had
an
overpowering
sense
of
the
minuteness
of
humanity
so
that
the
crowds
crossing
and
recrossing
the
circus
seemed
like
tiny
animals
crawling
over
the
surface
of
a
pond
from
which
the
water
had
been
drained
his
old
fancy
of
the
waterways
came
back
to
him
and
now
he
thought
that
oxford
circus
often
a
maelstrom
of
tossing
whirling
humanity
had
run
dry
and
lay
stagnant
filled
with
dying
life
beneath
the
sky
ever
lower
and
lower
that
sky
seemed
to
fall
theatres
restaurants
on
that
evening
were
almost
deserted
people
stood
about
in
groups
saying
that
soon
the
thunder
would
be
upon
them
wondering
at
this
weather
in
march
watching
with
curious
eyes
the
sky
breton
was
near
madness
that
evening
he
was
near
madness
to
this
extent
that
he
was
not
certain
of
reality
were
those
real
what
was
the
meaning
of
those
strange
high
buildings
in
whose
heart
there
burnt
so
sinister
a
light
he
watched
them
expecting
that
at
any
moment
these
would
burst
into
flame
and
with
a
screaming
rattling
flare
go
tossing
to
the
sky
near
him
a
girl
said
all
right
of
course
it
ai
of
no
moment
what
i
might
happen
to
oh
no
a
mild
young
man
answered
her
well
if
yer
want
ter
go
to
the
oxford
why
not
say
so
what
i
say
why
not
say
so
of
about
oh
about
say
that
again
and
off
i
go
about
i
like
to
know
i
did
say
anythink
about
your
about
yer
catch
a
feller
up
so
quickly
bertha
what
i
mean
to
say
oh
yer
and
yer
meanin
do
know
what
yer
mean
if
the
truth
were
known
a
pleasant
way
of
spendin
an
evenin
breton
regarded
them
with
curiosity
were
they
real
did
they
feel
the
strange
oppression
of
this
lowering
sky
as
strongly
as
he
did
were
they
uncertain
as
to
whether
these
buildings
were
alive
or
no
perhaps
they
could
tell
him
whether
those
omnibuses
that
came
lumbering
so
heavily
up
regent
street
were
safe
and
secure
oddly
enough
although
he
tried
he
could
not
remember
exactly
what
it
was
that
christopher
had
told
him
something
of
course
to
do
with
his
grandmother
everything
was
to
do
with
her
she
was
the
one
who
was
driving
him
to
destruction
always
she
was
stepping
forward
sending
him
down
when
he
was
climbing
up
at
last
to
safety
always
it
was
she
who
stood
behind
him
on
the
watch
lest
some
happiness
or
success
should
come
his
way
he
felt
as
though
he
would
like
to
go
and
force
his
way
into
portland
place
and
face
the
woman
and
tell
her
what
she
had
done
to
him
yes
that
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
see
all
those
beaminster
relations
gathering
round
protesting
frightened
and
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
really
did
not
know
the
way
to
portland
place
things
were
so
strange
he
knew
that
it
was
close
at
hand
but
he
was
afraid
that
he
would
never
find
it
he
was
really
afraid
that
he
would
never
find
it
some
man
jostled
into
him
apologized
and
moved
away
the
contact
cleared
his
brain
asserted
the
reality
of
the
buildings
the
crowds
the
cabs
and
carriages
he
pulled
himself
together
and
began
slowly
to
walk
down
oxford
street
in
the
direction
of
tottenham
court
road
he
remembered
very
clearly
and
distinctly
what
it
was
that
christopher
had
told
him
rachel
was
in
danger
because
her
husband
had
heard
of
her
friendship
with
him
breton
it
would
not
have
been
francis
breton
if
he
had
not
taken
this
piece
of
news
and
looked
at
it
in
its
most
sensational
colours
he
had
through
all
these
last
weeks
been
striving
to
accustom
himself
to
the
agony
of
enduring
life
without
her
he
dimly
perceived
that
it
was
the
emptiness
of
life
rather
than
any
actual
loss
of
any
particular
person
that
was
so
terrible
to
him
he
had
still
very
fine
and
beautiful
his
memory
of
the
day
when
she
had
come
to
him
in
his
rooms
and
had
that
day
been
followed
by
a
secret
relationship
between
them
and
many
hours
spent
together
then
his
passion
would
have
been
very
genuine
and
moving
but
after
all
she
had
flashed
into
his
life
and
then
flashed
out
of
it
again
and
so
swiftly
with
him
did
moods
follow
one
upon
another
and
ideals
and
ambitions
and
despairs
and
glories
jostle
together
in
his
brain
that
she
might
have
remained
very
happily
raised
to
a
fine
altar
in
his
temple
very
distantly
recognized
as
a
beautiful
episode
now
closed
and
contemplated
only
from
a
worshipping
distance
had
any
other
figure
or
incident
definitely
occupied
his
attention
but
no
figure
no
incident
had
arrived
he
had
had
during
all
these
weeks
no
drama
into
which
he
might
fling
his
fine
feelings
his
great
ambitions
his
glorious
sacrifices
of
genuine
sincerity
were
these
moods
of
his
he
had
never
stood
sufficiently
beyond
himself
to
arrive
at
any
definite
insincerity
about
any
of
his
movements
or
impulses
but
of
all
things
in
the
world
he
could
not
endure
that
his
life
should
be
empty
and
empty
now
it
had
been
for
as
it
seemed
to
his
swift
impatience
a
long
long
time
christopher
news
did
touch
him
very
deeply
he
would
instantly
have
sacrificed
his
life
his
honour
anything
at
all
for
rachel
and
the
fact
that
he
would
enjoy
the
drama
of
that
sacrifice
did
not
rob
it
of
any
atom
of
its
sincerity
but
the
pity
of
it
was
that
he
really
did
not
see
what
he
could
do
had
he
been
able
here
and
now
to
rush
into
the
portland
place
house
and
seize
his
grandmother
by
the
throat
and
shake
her
or
had
it
been
possible
to
appear
before
roddy
seddon
to
declare
himself
the
only
culprit
to
proclaim
that
he
was
ready
for
any
condemnation
any
punishment
then
in
spite
of
all
his
unhappiness
he
would
be
now
a
happy
man
but
alas
the
only
possible
action
was
to
pause
to
see
what
happened
to
wait
and
waiting
it
was
that
sent
him
mad
one
action
indeed
possible
and
that
was
that
he
should
put
a
close
to
his
wretched
existence
on
this
close
and
sterile
night
such
an
action
did
not
appear
at
all
absurd
it
had
fine
elements
about
it
it
would
deal
a
sure
blow
at
his
grandmother
and
all
that
family
who
had
treated
him
so
basely
what
a
headline
for
the
papers
suicide
of
member
of
one
of
england
noblest
families
rachel
should
be
no
longer
annoyed
with
his
unfortunate
presence
he
would
make
it
of
course
quite
obvious
that
she
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
sad
end
he
looked
about
him
with
an
air
of
fine
melancholy
at
the
little
they
knew
of
the
terrible
tragedy
that
was
even
now
preparing
in
their
midst
he
felt
almost
happy
again
as
he
turned
this
solution
over
and
over
again
some
people
would
be
sorry
christopher
lizzie
rand
and
rachel
above
all
it
must
be
heavy
upon
the
consciences
of
the
duchess
and
her
wretched
children
they
had
driven
him
to
his
death
and
must
bear
the
blame
to
the
grave
and
beyond
very
faintly
the
rolling
of
thunder
could
be
heard
as
the
storm
approached
the
town
he
was
standing
outside
the
oxford
music
hall
and
he
thought
that
he
would
go
inside
for
a
little
time
that
he
might
avoid
the
rain
and
then
upon
that
followed
the
reflection
that
it
did
not
matter
whether
he
was
wet
or
no
he
would
soon
be
dead
faintly
behind
these
gloomy
resolves
some
voice
seemed
to
tell
him
that
if
he
could
only
pass
safely
through
this
night
fortune
would
again
be
kind
to
him
wait
something
told
him
be
patient
for
once
in
your
life
but
no
to
wait
any
more
was
impossible
some
fine
action
some
splendid
defiance
or
heroic
defence
here
and
now
otherwise
he
would
show
the
world
that
he
had
courage
at
least
to
die
most
of
his
impetuous
follies
had
their
origin
in
his
conviction
that
the
eyes
of
the
world
were
always
upon
him
he
paid
his
money
and
walked
into
the
circle
promenade
behind
him
was
a
bar
at
which
several
stout
gentlemen
and
ladies
were
happily
conversational
in
front
of
him
a
crowd
of
men
and
women
leaned
forward
over
the
back
of
the
circle
and
listened
to
the
entertainment
on
the
stage
in
a
circle
of
brilliant
light
a
thin
man
with
a
melancholy
face
a
top
hat
and
trousers
was
singing
straike
me
pink
and
straike
me
blue
straike
me
purple
and
crimson
too
i
be
there
lottie
dear
down
by
the
old
canteen
now
said
the
gentleman
once
more
let
it
all
together
there
was
a
moment
pause
then
the
orchestra
began
very
softly
and
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
the
crowd
sang
straike
me
pink
and
straike
me
blue
straike
me
purple
and
crimson
too
etc
breton
sat
down
on
a
little
velvet
seat
near
the
bar
and
gloomily
looked
about
him
did
they
only
realize
these
people
the
tragedy
that
was
so
close
to
them
then
would
they
very
swiftly
cease
their
silly
singing
the
place
was
hot
infernally
hot
it
glowed
with
light
it
crackled
with
noise
it
was
possessed
with
a
glaring
unreality
it
occurred
to
him
that
to
make
a
leap
upon
the
railing
at
the
back
of
the
circle
to
stand
for
one
instant
balanced
there
before
the
frightened
people
then
to
plunge
down
down
into
the
stalls
that
would
be
a
striking
finish
how
they
would
all
scream
and
run
and
scatter
yes
against
the
clinking
and
chatter
of
the
bar
he
would
hear
the
voice
of
the
funny
man
and
so
i
says
to
if
you
tryin
to
prove
to
me
that
it
two
in
the
mornin
then
i
says
what
i
want
to
know
is
oo
been
yer
to
stay
awake
all
this
time
that
what
it
was
then
that
in
spite
of
himself
he
was
drawn
from
his
moody
thoughts
by
the
eyes
of
the
girl
standing
near
the
bar
against
the
wall
she
was
a
small
timid
rather
pale
girl
in
a
huge
black
hat
she
wore
a
long
trailing
purple
dress
and
soiled
white
gloves
and
was
looking
just
now
unhappy
and
frightened
he
had
noticed
her
because
of
the
contrast
that
her
white
face
and
small
body
made
with
her
grand
untidy
clothes
but
looking
at
her
more
closely
he
saw
something
about
her
that
stirred
all
his
sympathy
and
protection
like
most
englishmen
he
was
at
heart
an
eager
sentimentalist
and
he
was
just
now
in
a
mood
that
responded
instantly
to
anyone
in
distress
he
forgot
for
the
moment
his
desperate
plans
of
a
fat
man
came
from
the
bar
towards
her
with
two
drinks
he
was
himself
very
unsteady
and
uncertain
in
his
movements
and
his
smile
was
both
vacuous
and
full
of
purpose
he
lurched
towards
her
put
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
to
steady
himself
then
as
one
of
the
glasses
spilled
cursed
she
refused
the
drink
but
he
continued
to
press
it
upon
her
his
fat
hand
wandered
about
her
neck
stroked
her
chin
and
he
was
leaning
now
so
that
his
face
almost
touched
hers
breton
heard
him
say
well
if
you
wo
drink
damme
come
along
my
dear
let
be
goin
she
shook
her
head
her
eyes
growing
larger
and
larger
nonshensh
he
said
darn
nonshensh
she
glanced
about
her
desperately
but
no
one
save
breton
was
watching
them
she
caught
his
eyes
pitifully
eagerly
the
man
put
his
arm
about
her
and
tried
to
draw
her
from
the
wall
come
he
said
we
go
home
she
drew
away
he
pulled
at
her
hand
damn
the
o
place
wash
the
matter
you
got
to
come
then
he
seized
her
by
the
arm
and
still
lurching
from
side
to
side
began
to
move
away
no
no
she
whispered
obviously
terrified
of
a
scene
but
using
all
her
strength
to
resist
her
eyes
again
met
breton
that
lady
he
said
advancing
to
the
stout
gentleman
is
a
friend
of
mine
the
man
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
astonished
simply
and
rather
puzzled
wash
wash
he
said
you
be
so
good
as
to
leave
that
lady
alone
well
i
b
well
damned
oh
gosh
the
stout
gentleman
contemplated
him
with
furious
amazement
the
b
i
like
to
know
get
out
or
i
kick
yer
out
the
quarrel
had
by
now
gathered
its
crowd
the
stout
gentleman
lurching
forward
aimed
a
blow
at
breton
which
missed
him
let
her
alone
do
you
hear
cried
breton
the
stout
gentleman
amazed
apparently
at
a
world
that
defied
all
the
probabilities
turned
caught
the
girl
by
the
body
and
dragging
her
with
him
pushed
past
his
opponent
breton
seized
him
by
the
waist
turned
him
round
so
that
with
a
little
puzzled
gasp
he
half
fell
half
sat
upon
the
cushioned
seat
against
the
wall
then
breton
offered
the
girl
his
arm
and
walked
away
with
her
conscious
that
an
attendant
had
arrived
rather
late
upon
the
scene
and
was
now
abusing
the
stout
gentleman
whilst
a
sympathetic
little
crowd
listened
and
advised
he
walked
down
the
stairs
with
the
girl
that
decent
of
you
she
said
most
awfully
beyond
the
doors
the
world
was
a
hissing
spurting
deluge
of
rain
a
cab
was
called
and
she
climbed
into
it
what
about
coming
back
she
said
he
shook
his
head
not
you
have
a
good
rest
that
what
you
want
well
i
done
meet
night
i
hope
so
he
said
politely
he
raised
his
hat
and
the
cab
splashed
away
another
cab
sir
said
the
commissionaire
no
thanks
said
breton
and
plunged
out
into
the
rain
the
air
was
fresh
and
cool
streams
of
water
danced
and
spurted
on
the
gleaming
pavements
breton
walked
along
the
little
adventure
had
swept
completely
from
his
mind
his
earlier
desperate
decisions
there
were
still
things
for
him
to
do
poor
little
girl
he
was
glad
that
he
had
been
there
what
a
fool
he
had
been
all
these
weeks
sitting
there
letting
himself
go
to
pieces
because
the
world
had
gone
badly
what
sort
of
a
creature
was
he
well
he
was
some
good
yet
just
one
twist
of
the
hand
and
that
man
had
gone
down
yes
she
was
grateful
her
eyes
had
shone
and
what
of
the
candles
his
business
why
had
he
allowed
that
to
drop
when
he
had
made
already
so
good
a
start
he
would
be
in
the
city
early
business
was
humming
just
now
and
rachel
rachel
let
him
be
content
to
have
her
as
his
ideal
his
fine
beacon
to
light
him
on
to
hold
him
to
his
work
and
do
the
best
that
was
in
him
after
all
things
were
for
the
best
they
would
always
have
their
fine
memories
one
of
the
other
nothing
to
spoil
that
idyll
he
arrived
soaked
to
the
very
skin
at
his
door
funny
he
thought
how
that
thunder
depresses
one
i
been
moody
for
weeks
air
ever
so
much
clearer
now
god
did
that
old
beast
tumble
poor
little
girl
she
grateful
though
then
as
he
opened
the
door
he
remembered
what
christopher
had
that
evening
told
him
he
said
to
himself
in
a
fine
glow
of
hope
and
confidence
i
get
to
work
and
soon
stop
that
wicked
old
woman
mouth
rachel
god
bless
her
i
show
her
what
i
like
he
climbed
the
dark
stairs
as
though
he
were
storming
a
town
chapter
v
march
rachel
heart
when
god
smote
his
hands
together
and
struck
out
the
soul
at
a
spark
into
the
organized
glory
of
things
from
drops
of
the
dark
say
didst
thou
shine
didst
thou
burn
didst
thou
honour
the
power
in
the
form
as
the
star
does
at
night
or
the
or
even
the
little
have
sinned
she
said
elizabeth
barrett
browning
i
meanwhile
rachel
had
not
spoken
to
roddy
bad
though
the
months
had
been
since
that
terrible
afternoon
at
seddon
these
days
that
followed
the
duchess
visit
were
the
worst
that
she
had
ever
known
during
the
weeks
that
immediately
followed
roddy
accident
she
was
allowed
no
line
for
thought
she
discovered
and
she
never
forgot
the
sharpness
of
the
discovery
that
she
was
the
poorest
of
nurses
everything
that
she
did
was
clumsily
and
slowly
done
she
watched
lizzie
rand
with
admiration
and
wonder
dimly
through
the
absorption
that
held
her
thoughts
of
francis
breton
pierced
but
always
to
be
instantly
dismissed
before
her
was
simply
the
amazing
incredible
fact
that
roddy
the
most
active
the
most
vigorous
of
human
beings
would
never
stand
upon
his
feet
again
she
could
see
nothing
but
roddy
and
no
service
no
sacrifice
was
too
stern
or
too
difficult
meanwhile
subtly
almost
unconsciously
she
was
influenced
by
lizzie
rand
it
was
not
strange
to
her
that
lizzie
should
have
changed
so
swiftly
from
hatred
to
friendship
and
affection
rachel
was
passionate
enough
herself
to
understand
that
a
woman
will
go
instantly
to
the
person
who
needs
her
most
even
though
she
has
hated
that
same
person
five
minutes
before
no
the
thing
that
was
wonderful
to
her
was
that
lizzie
rand
should
combine
such
feeling
with
such
discipline
to
watch
her
as
she
moved
about
roddy
rooms
was
to
deny
to
her
the
possibility
of
emotion
of
anything
that
could
disturb
that
efficiency
and
yet
rachel
knew
she
had
seen
depths
of
feeling
in
lizzie
that
made
her
own
desires
and
regrets
small
and
puny
things
but
it
did
not
need
lizzie
power
to
abase
rachel
before
roddy
it
would
have
been
enough
for
her
to
have
remembered
what
her
thoughts
and
intentions
had
been
on
that
day
to
have
brought
her
on
her
knees
to
beg
his
pardon
but
when
she
saw
the
fashion
in
which
he
bore
his
sentence
his
endurance
his
stubborn
will
beating
down
any
temptation
to
despair
she
recognized
that
it
was
very
little
of
roddy
that
she
had
known
before
this
crisis
then
as
the
weeks
passed
and
the
world
settled
into
this
new
shape
and
form
thoughts
of
francis
breton
returned
to
her
she
had
written
to
him
soon
after
the
accident
but
that
was
for
herself
that
she
might
clear
her
mind
of
anything
except
her
husband
rather
than
for
breton
she
had
considered
him
whilst
she
wrote
that
letter
had
seen
him
as
someone
in
her
old
old
life
someone
who
had
stirred
her
then
but
possessed
now
no
power
to
move
her
she
wanted
him
to
be
happy
but
wished
never
to
see
him
again
once
long
ago
there
had
been
a
scene
in
a
room
and
she
had
been
carried
up
to
strange
and
dangerous
heights
and
the
world
had
tossed
and
stormed
about
her
but
oh
how
long
ago
that
was
how
younger
she
had
been
then
but
as
the
weeks
passed
that
scene
drew
closer
to
her
and
life
crept
back
into
its
heart
sometimes
when
roddy
was
sleeping
and
she
was
sitting
there
beside
him
and
about
her
the
house
slumbered
and
the
very
birds
were
still
her
heart
would
beat
beat
thickly
her
cheeks
would
flush
and
she
would
remember
that
had
it
not
been
for
a
horse
that
stumbled
she
might
be
now
far
away
leading
a
life
that
might
be
tragedy
but
that
was
at
any
rate
life
she
would
beat
the
thought
down
she
would
tell
herself
what
now
from
this
distance
she
knew
to
be
true
that
she
would
not
have
been
happy
had
she
gone
with
breton
she
remembered
that
even
at
that
supreme
moment
in
breton
rooms
when
he
had
kissed
her
for
the
first
time
her
swift
thought
had
been
poor
roddy
she
knew
with
an
older
wisdom
than
she
had
possessed
two
months
ago
that
breton
on
his
side
would
not
have
held
her
any
more
than
roddy
in
his
so
different
fashion
could
hold
her
now
was
she
to
be
always
thus
wanting
something
that
was
not
hers
during
the
weeks
that
had
immediately
followed
the
accident
she
had
thought
that
at
last
love
for
roddy
had
really
come
to
her
then
as
the
days
threaded
their
way
she
knew
that
it
was
not
so
he
was
more
to
her
much
more
to
her
helpless
and
courageous
than
he
could
ever
have
been
under
the
old
conditions
but
it
was
not
passion
it
was
care
affection
even
love
she
loved
him
yes
but
she
was
not
in
love
with
him
he
held
all
of
her
save
that
one
part
that
breton
alone
of
all
human
beings
had
called
out
of
her
but
she
had
learnt
discipline
during
these
weeks
down
down
she
drove
rebellion
memory
she
was
roddy
she
had
dedicated
her
life
to
his
happiness
then
they
came
to
london
lizzie
returned
to
her
mother
and
to
lady
adela
and
rachel
was
alone
life
was
again
very
difficult
for
her
roddy
was
wonderfully
cheerful
but
rachel
found
that
she
could
not
do
very
much
for
him
he
liked
to
have
her
there
but
she
knew
that
many
of
his
friends
who
could
tell
him
the
town
gossip
the
latest
from
clubs
the
hunting
and
racing
chatter
entertained
him
more
than
she
did
she
had
not
since
her
marriage
made
many
friends
and
she
knew
that
almost
everyone
who
came
to
their
little
house
came
for
roddy
sake
rather
than
for
hers
she
did
not
mind
that
she
was
glad
that
he
was
happy
but
she
wished
that
he
needed
her
a
little
more
roddy
urged
her
to
drive
to
see
people
to
dine
and
go
to
the
theatre
she
went
because
she
saw
that
it
disturbed
him
if
he
felt
that
she
stayed
indoors
for
his
sake
but
she
did
not
enjoy
her
gaiety
when
she
was
out
she
wished
to
hurry
back
to
him
and
then
when
she
was
with
him
again
she
often
wondered
whether
her
presence
made
him
any
happier
through
all
his
intercourse
with
her
she
discerned
a
wistful
restraint
as
though
he
would
like
to
ask
her
for
something
that
he
had
not
got
and
yet
was
afraid
when
she
felt
this
in
him
she
redoubled
her
affection
towards
him
but
she
thought
that
he
noticed
this
and
knew
her
effort
her
thoughts
went
often
now
to
francis
breton
not
as
to
anyone
whom
she
would
ever
see
again
but
she
hoped
that
he
was
happy
wondered
whether
there
was
anyone
to
look
after
him
wished
that
he
had
some
friend
so
that
she
might
know
that
he
was
safe
her
pride
did
not
allow
her
to
speak
to
lizzie
rand
about
him
they
had
had
one
talk
when
lizzie
had
taken
her
letter
but
that
was
all
then
as
february
drew
to
a
close
she
was
unwell
that
was
so
unusual
for
her
that
she
might
have
been
disturbed
had
it
been
anything
more
material
than
headaches
strange
fits
of
indifference
to
everything
and
a
general
failure
of
energy
she
thought
that
she
was
indoors
too
much
and
was
now
in
the
air
as
often
as
her
duties
to
roddy
allowed
her
but
the
indifference
persisted
her
feelings
for
roddy
were
an
odd
confusion
there
were
times
when
she
was
away
from
him
and
the
thought
of
him
made
her
heart
beat
this
is
love
at
last
there
were
times
again
when
as
she
sat
beside
him
she
could
have
beaten
her
hands
against
the
walls
for
very
boredom
and
for
his
impenetrable
taciturnity
as
he
read
from
the
births
and
marriages
on
the
front
page
to
the
advertisements
on
the
last
and
flung
her
details
london
scottish
won
their
game
at
richmond
that
fettes
man
got
over
three
times
or
i
would
give
a
button
for
that
horse
of
old
tranty
stummits
they
all
so
gone
on
you
mark
my
words
i
like
to
see
that
new
piece
of
edwardes
they
got
a
girl
in
it
who
dances
on
her
nose
jolly
pretty
she
is
too
so
massiter
says
he
been
five
times
and
there
a
song
about
moonlight
or
some
old
rot
that
they
say
is
spiffin
how
to
adjust
this
horrible
stupidity
with
the
courage
the
humour
the
affection
even
the
poetry
that
she
found
in
him
at
other
times
there
were
days
when
she
cared
for
him
with
a
new
thrilling
emotion
something
that
had
in
it
a
quality
of
curiosity
as
though
he
were
coming
before
her
as
someone
unknown
and
unexpected
there
were
other
days
when
she
wondered
how
he
could
have
remained
through
all
the
crisis
so
precisely
the
same
roddy
meanwhile
between
all
these
uncertainties
she
lost
touch
with
herself
it
was
as
though
her
soul
flew
like
some
bird
in
a
strange
country
from
point
to
point
restless
unsatisfied
ii
then
those
few
hurried
words
with
christopher
on
the
afternoon
of
the
duchess
visit
flung
at
an
instant
her
whole
life
into
crisis
even
as
the
words
left
him
she
knew
that
it
was
up
to
this
that
all
her
days
had
been
leading
that
at
last
she
was
in
very
truth
face
to
face
with
her
grandmother
that
the
battle
between
the
two
of
them
had
commenced
she
knew
in
those
few
minutes
whilst
she
stood
there
motionless
in
that
room
other
things
she
knew
and
this
was
the
first
sharp
conviction
that
struck
her
heart
that
at
all
costs
whatever
else
might
come
to
her
she
must
not
now
lose
roddy
love
strangely
as
she
stood
there
facing
her
danger
some
warm
glow
heightened
her
colour
as
she
felt
from
this
what
roddy
really
meant
to
her
she
thought
then
of
francis
breton
of
his
danger
if
her
family
understood
how
implicated
he
was
with
her
it
was
true
that
she
had
not
very
long
ago
contemplated
running
away
with
him
and
surely
nothing
could
have
implicated
him
more
than
that
but
now
that
he
should
suffer
and
yet
not
have
her
secured
as
his
reward
for
his
suffering
that
at
all
pain
to
herself
she
must
prevent
her
first
impulse
after
christopher
had
left
her
was
to
go
down
instantly
to
roddy
and
confess
everything
then
she
paused
perhaps
after
all
her
grandmother
had
not
spoken
in
that
case
how
cruel
to
make
roddy
miserable
with
something
that
was
dead
and
already
remote
in
her
heart
too
was
terror
lest
she
should
precipitate
breton
into
some
peril
on
every
side
it
seemed
to
her
better
that
she
should
wait
and
discover
perhaps
through
christopher
perhaps
by
her
own
intelligence
what
exactly
had
occurred
four
days
afterwards
on
the
afternoon
of
that
day
that
brought
breton
to
dine
with
christopher
she
had
not
yet
spoken
she
had
taken
no
steps
at
all
despising
herself
afraid
for
breton
feeling
at
one
instant
that
roddy
knew
everything
at
another
that
he
knew
nothing
ill
with
this
same
lassitude
that
had
hung
about
her
now
for
so
many
weeks
determining
at
one
moment
that
she
would
confront
her
grandmother
at
another
that
she
would
go
instantly
and
confess
to
roddy
yet
rachel
hesitated
and
did
nothing
on
this
close
and
heavy
afternoon
rachel
sat
up
in
her
little
wondering
whether
she
would
wait
there
for
possible
callers
or
go
down
to
roddy
who
was
being
entertained
at
the
moment
by
lord
massiter
or
complete
confession
of
surrender
to
nerves
and
general
catastrophe
go
up
to
her
bedroom
pull
down
the
blinds
and
lie
there
hunting
sleep
the
day
was
intolerably
heavy
the
windows
of
the
little
room
had
all
been
flung
open
and
through
the
park
figures
wearily
dragged
themselves
and
the
waters
of
the
lake
lay
as
though
they
had
fallen
because
of
this
leaden
heaviness
from
the
grey
sky
she
sat
there
listening
for
every
sound
starting
at
every
opening
or
closing
of
a
door
thinking
that
were
lord
massiter
not
there
she
would
go
down
now
and
tell
everything
to
roddy
yet
knowing
in
her
heart
that
if
peters
were
to
come
now
and
tell
her
that
his
master
was
alone
she
would
not
move
peters
come
but
it
was
to
tell
her
that
lord
john
would
like
to
see
her
uncle
john
she
scarcely
knew
whether
she
hailed
him
as
a
relief
or
no
oh
ask
him
to
come
up
peters
at
once
bring
tea
here
lord
massiter
will
have
his
downstairs
i
expect
had
her
grandmother
told
uncle
john
anything
was
his
visit
in
connection
with
anything
that
he
had
heard
of
all
the
changes
that
her
marriage
had
brought
her
that
she
should
have
slipped
away
from
uncle
john
was
one
of
the
saddest
she
loved
him
as
dearly
as
ever
but
restraint
had
been
there
between
them
struggle
against
it
though
they
might
he
was
like
roddy
so
ineloquent
that
anything
like
a
situation
was
real
agony
to
him
he
could
never
explain
his
feelings
about
anything
and
he
would
eagerly
agree
with
you
that
it
was
a
great
pity
that
he
had
any
what
had
made
this
trouble
between
them
rachel
only
knew
that
now
there
were
so
many
things
in
her
life
which
uncle
john
could
not
understand
at
her
heart
her
love
for
him
was
as
clear
and
simple
as
it
had
ever
been
but
oh
uncle
john
was
glad
to
see
her
his
picture
of
her
as
she
sat
there
her
cheeks
flushed
in
a
dress
with
the
room
as
soft
and
delicate
as
a
shell
around
her
filled
him
with
delight
changes
had
come
to
him
even
since
their
last
meeting
the
lines
in
his
forehead
seemed
to
her
a
little
deeper
his
eyes
were
anxious
and
his
smile
less
sure
and
genial
he
wore
a
beautiful
white
waistcoat
and
sat
there
with
his
chest
out
his
white
hair
rising
into
a
crest
looking
exactly
like
a
pouter
pigeon
dear
uncle
john
i
glad
well
my
dear
i
was
just
passing
been
to
some
woman
who
got
a
party
in
harley
house
war
party
of
course
there
were
characters
of
the
names
of
different
generals
and
if
you
won
you
paid
a
guinea
to
the
war
fund
quite
a
reversal
of
the
ordinary
proceedings
i
sure
my
dear
i
do
know
why
i
went
well
it
was
so
close
that
i
felt
i
could
walk
back
even
to
without
a
cup
of
tea
from
you
roddy
all
right
lord
massiter
been
down
there
chatting
to
him
ever
since
three
would
you
like
us
to
go
down
and
have
our
tea
with
or
shall
we
stay
cosily
up
here
by
ourselves

up
here

course
you

very
well
my
dear

the
thing

this
business
with
roddy
he
took
her
hand
and
held
it
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
you
went
away
for
a
week
or
two
and
had
a
change
no
uncle
john
dear
thank
you
i
tired
and
i
go
away
later
on
but
just
now
it
would
only
make
me
anxious
and
i
should
worry
about
roddy
tea
was
brought
she
looked
at
uncle
john
and
thought
that
he
had
heard
nothing
his
guileless
eyes
smiled
back
at
her
all
that
she
could
discern
in
him
was
apprehension
lest
he
should
say
something
to
displease
her
to
make
her
angry
bless
his
heart
he
need
not
be
afraid
of
that
now
as
she
gave
him
his
sugar
she
felt
that
some
of
the
old
intimate
relationship
between
them
was
creeping
back
of
course
you
heard
of
grandmother
wonderful
visit
to
us
the
other
day
rachel
said
was
it
amazing
and
christopher
says
that
she
was
none
the
worse
rather
the
better
amazing
said
uncle
john
very
solemnly
perfectly
astonishing
your
grandmother
rachel
is
an
astounding
woman
just
when
we
were
all
of
us
thinking
that
she
was
really
not
quite
so
well
quite
so
fit
as
she
used
to
be
she
comes
along
and
does
something
that
she
has
done
for
thirty
years
i
confess
i
was
nervous
when
i
first
heard
of
it
but
christopher
reassured
me
said
it
would
do
her
no
harm
and
it
has
it
shows
what
her
affection
for
roddy
is
rachel
said
slowly
and
for
you
dear
uncle
john
said
timidly
i
know
that
you
have
well
have
that
is
were
always
very
friendly
but
i
hope
that
now
you
come
to
understand
her
a
little
more
she
a
difficult
woman
she
would
be
so
splendid
if
she
were
so
difficult
he
saw
those
hard
lines
that
he
knew
of
old
strike
into
rachel
face
he
shrank
back
himself
afraid
that
he
had
by
one
ruthless
sentence
lost
all
the
happy
intimacy
that
had
returned
to
them
she
had
risen
and
walked
to
the
window
dear
uncle
john
she
said
i
know
you
like
us
to
be
friends
bless
you
but
you
may
as
well
give
that
idea
up
once
and
for
ever
grandmother
and
i
the
old
and
the
new
generation
you
know
there
never
been
anything
but
war
and
never
will
be
besides
she
never
forgiven
me
for
marrying
roddy
although
she
arranged
it
all
oh
my
dear
said
uncle
john
no
it
is
so
i
should
be
astonished
she
continued
bitterly
if
i
were
to
hear
that
she
thinks
that
i
flung
roddy
from
his
horse
and
trampled
on
him
it
would
be
quite
likely
then
suddenly
she
came
back
from
the
window
to
the
sofa
where
uncle
john
looking
greatly
distressed
was
sitting
she
leaned
down
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
her
cheek
next
to
his
uncle
john
dear
do
you
worry
about
grandmother
and
me
that
an
old
old
story
and
it
ca
alter
the
case
of
us
two
you
and
me
is
much
more
important
i
been
a
beast
for
a
long
time
uncle
john
we
got
away
from
one
another
somehow
and
it
all
been
my
fault
been
a
prig
and
all
sorts
of
horrid
things
and
i
let
things
come
between
us
nothing
shall
ever
come
between
us
again
never
he
kissed
her
and
his
fat
body
thrilled
with
happiness
amongst
all
the
distressing
things
that
this
last
year
had
brought
him
nothing
had
been
more
distressing
than
his
separation
from
rachel
now
the
old
rachel
had
come
back
to
him
again
they
sat
on
the
sofa
there
and
he
talked
of
a
number
of
things
in
his
old
happy
disconnected
way
some
of
her
apprehension
lifted
from
rachel
she
forgot
the
closeness
of
the
day
and
sat
there
happier
than
she
had
been
for
many
weeks
six
struck
and
he
got
up
to
go
taking
your
aunt
out
to
dinner
you
going
anywhere
my
dear
yes
it
such
a
nuisance
but
roddy
insists
on
my
going
i
so
much
rather
stay
with
him
it
only
a
silly
little
dinner
at
lady
carloes
she
asked
a
harpist
in
afterwards
fancy
harpist
but
uncle
john
liked
lady
carloes
she
was
an
old
friend
of
his
laugh
at
lady
carloes
dear
she
a
kind
creature
and
been
a
friend
of
the
family
for
ever
so
long
a
devoted
friend
he
stopped
suddenly
by
the
way
something
i
meant
to
have
told
you
he
dropped
his
voice
you
need
say
anything
about
it
and
i
want
to
worry
your
grandmother
i
afraid
she
would
like
it
but
the
black
sheep
is
to
be
restored
to
the
fold
the
black
sheep
said
rachel
wondering
yes
said
uncle
john
your
cousin
frank
breton
my
dear
your
uncle
vincent
and
your
aunt
and
i
thought
that
he
behaved
so
well
been
so
quiet
and
steady
all
this
time
that
really
something
ought
to
be
done
about
him
it
been
on
my
conscience
i
can
assure
you
for
a
long
time
past
well
i
written
to
him
i
going
to
see
him
of
course
better
to
be
quiet
about
it
whilst
your
grandmother
feels
as
she
does
but
in
time
rachel
voice
was
sharp
and
rather
harsh
as
she
said
dear
uncle
john
that
kind
of
you
i
so
glad
poor
cousin
frank
i
always
felt
it
unfair
john
looked
at
her
with
one
of
his
supplicating
glances
rachel
really
strange
she
seemed
to
dislike
the
idea
of
redemption
he
had
thought
that
she
would
have
been
delighted
she
kissed
him
nothing
ever
to
come
between
us
again
she
whispered
he
pressed
her
hand
i
must
just
look
in
upon
roddy
he
said
and
they
went
down
together
iii
the
thought
that
instantly
occurred
to
her
was
that
she
must
not
allow
uncle
john
to
talk
to
roddy
about
breton
she
saw
some
innocent
word
falling
like
a
match
into
a
haystack
and
starting
immediately
the
most
horrible
blaze
there
were
other
thoughts
behind
that
thought
of
her
actions
when
she
heard
of
this
thoughts
of
roddy
probable
decision
about
it
thoughts
that
she
rachel
might
prove
to
be
the
one
person
in
the
world
who
had
helped
to
drive
breton
out
thoughts
intolerable
were
they
for
a
moment
indulged
but
now
as
she
walked
laughing
downstairs
with
uncle
john
her
one
urgent
resolve
was
to
prevent
an
immediate
scene
she
need
not
have
feared
massiter
stout
hearty
and
stupid
held
the
stage
he
had
been
holding
it
since
three
and
white
face
showed
fatigue
his
eyes
were
half
closed
and
although
he
smiled
his
mind
distressed
and
exhausted
was
far
away
rachel
glance
at
him
told
her
that
his
visitor
had
been
too
much
for
him
when
she
saw
roddy
like
this
she
longed
to
have
him
alone
away
from
all
the
world
to
love
him
and
care
for
him
although
in
hard
fact
when
he
was
worn
out
peters
was
of
more
value
than
she
she
looked
at
him
now
loved
him
and
was
also
afraid
she
hated
lord
massiter
at
this
moment
and
hoped
that
he
would
go
he
talked
in
his
cheerful
voice
as
though
he
were
addressing
an
assembly
in
the
open
air
he
spoke
of
the
hunting
pretty
rotten
of
the
musical
comedies
absolutely
rotten
of
our
tactics
in
south
africa
rotten
of
course
beyond
all
words
and
of
farming
on
his
land
in
the
country
unspeakably
rotten
and
was
cheerful
about
all
these
things
he
knew
that
he
had
been
and
had
spent
a
whole
afternoon
in
cheering
up
that
poor
devil
seddon
got
to
lie
on
his
back
all
his
life
poor
chap
active
beggar
he
was
too
he
overwhelmed
lord
john
whom
he
liked
but
scorned
never
takes
any
decent
exercise
john
beaminster
always
about
with
a
parcel
of
women
finally
he
departed
carrying
with
him
a
faint
scent
of
soap
and
tobacco
swearing
that
it
was
the
closest
night
he
ever
known
and
wiping
his
red
forehead
with
the
air
of
one
who
rules
this
country
and
is
going
very
shortly
to
enjoy
an
excellent
meal
soon
uncle
john
also
departed
roddy
alone
with
rachel
faintly
smiled
and
then
closed
his
eyes
again
better
go
and
dress
dear
it
gone
six
what
on
earth
did
he
stay
all
that
time
for
roaring
like
a
bull
she
cried
indignantly
tired
you
out
roddy
dear
i
do
think
i
go
out
to
dinner
i
send
a
wire
to
lady
carloes
no
you
must
he
said
firmly
it
too
late
to
disappoint
her
it
such
an
appalling
night
i
not
feeling
awfully
well
i
think
i
could
stand
one
of
her
dinners
there
be
old
lord
crewner
old
brunning
and
young
somebody
or
other
for
me
and
i
believe
uncle
richard
i
simply
could
stand
it
are
you
well
he
looked
up
at
her
sharply
not
very
their
eyes
met
she
turned
hers
away
she
was
desperately
near
to
tears
near
to
flinging
herself
down
at
his
side
and
hiding
her
head
and
telling
him
all
wait
wait
perhaps
he
knows
nothing
still
looking
away
from
him
she
said
oh
yes
i
must
go
of
course
it
only
this
thunder
that
one
feels
she
bent
down
hurriedly
and
kissed
him
they
said
good
night
to
one
another
and
she
left
the
room
later
in
the
carriage
she
saw
his
white
face
and
was
miserable
she
thought
of
breton
and
that
made
her
miserable
too
to
everyone
she
seemed
to
bring
unhappiness
the
stifling
evening
held
a
hand
at
her
throat
the
carriage
moved
languidly
along
on
every
side
of
her
she
saw
people
listlessly
moving
as
though
controlled
by
an
enchantment
she
really
was
if
i
do
look
out
she
thought
i
shall
be
hysterical
i
shall
just
have
to
hold
on
and
keep
quiet
never
felt
like
this
before
fancy
being
hysterical
before
uncle
richard
surprised
he
be
and
how
he
disapprove
in
lady
carloes
small
and
stuffy
bony
brunning
and
lord
crewner
were
being
polite
to
one
another
one
would
suppose
that
it
had
been
lady
carloes
intention
to
gather
together
into
a
confined
space
as
many
of
her
grandmother
possessions
as
possible
her
grandmother
had
known
sir
walter
scott
and
had
lord
wellington
to
tea
and
spent
several
days
in
the
country
with
joanna
baillie
the
little
room
had
an
old
faded
covered
thickly
with
prints
miniatures
and
fading
on
the
many
little
tables
were
scattered
old
keepsakes
bijouterie
of
every
kind
dragon
china
coloured
stones
and
even
an
ebony
box
with
there
were
cabinets
and
glass
cases
several
chattering
clocks
nodding
mandarins
and
shepherdesses
on
the
mantelpiece
a
faded
illustrated
edition
of
sir
walter
poems
and
finally
three
cats
with
large
blue
bows
and
tinkling
bells
all
these
things
added
immensely
to
rachel
distress
on
such
an
evening
this
jumble
of
small
objects
rose
like
the
sound
of
the
sea
and
threatened
to
throttle
her
a
fire
was
burning
and
only
the
upper
part
of
one
window
was
open
rachel
felt
that
she
was
in
real
peril
of
fainting
that
she
had
never
done
but
she
had
the
sensation
that
at
any
moment
the
floor
with
its
old
faded
carpet
would
rise
slanting
before
her
and
pitch
her
into
the
street
lady
carloes
more
hunched
together
than
usual
her
voice
thick
and
husky
and
her
dress
of
blue
satin
hurried
in
uncle
richard
untouched
by
the
closeness
of
the
evening
clean
and
starched
and
dignified
made
his
majestic
entry
a
young
man
from
the
embassy
so
beautifully
dressed
that
he
appeared
to
have
spent
his
days
in
the
effort
to
make
his
personality
of
less
importance
than
his
studs
and
his
waistcoat
buttons
apologized
from
behind
his
shining
collar
for
being
the
last
of
the
party
they
all
went
down
to
dinner
rachel
felt
as
the
young
man
led
her
downstairs
that
at
last
she
knew
what
panic
was
panic
was
the
state
of
standing
surrounded
by
ordinary
everyday
things
and
people
waiting
for
the
bolt
to
fall
the
enemy
to
advance
danger
to
spring
but
seeing
in
actual
vision
nothing
to
justify
terror
she
had
reached
the
climax
of
months
of
alarm
and
during
these
past
days
unbroken
suspense
she
was
at
the
end
of
endurance
how
was
she
ever
to
compass
this
horrible
meal
the
young
man
was
finding
her
difficult
she
was
aware
that
uncle
richard
watched
her
and
was
expecting
her
to
sustain
the
family
ease
and
dignity
they
were
at
a
little
round
table
so
that
he
was
able
to
hear
all
the
conversation
yes
she
said
desperately
i
quite
agree
with
you
the
lack
of
enterprise
at
covent
garden
is
shameful
we
want
more
competition
so
i
said
to
her
good
woman
if
you
really
imagine
that
i
taken
in
by
your
pretending
that
that
dresden
herr
becknet
is
coming
in
afterwards
old
lady
carloes
said
like
him
my
dear
he
plays
the
harp
too
wonderfully
i
asked
a
few
friends
to
come
in
of
course
the
is
very
large
but
i
hope
the
room
was
swimming
before
rachel
a
stuffed
bird
in
a
glass
case
sailed
across
the
table
towards
her
and
the
fireplace
tottered
and
staggered
she
was
just
able
to
gasp
lady
carloes
please
it
this
heat
or
something
there
were
cries
of
agitation
the
young
man
gave
her
his
arm
into
the
passage
she
was
surrounded
by
anxious
servants
someone
fanned
her
she
drank
water
and
was
conscious
of
lady
carloes
blue
satin
and
uncle
richard
she
knew
now
what
she
wanted
she
pulled
herself
together
and
absolutely
refused
uncle
richard
escort
no
i
shall
be
all
right
really
no
uncle
richard
i
hear
of
it
it
was
silly
of
me
to
come
out
really
i
been
feeling
this
thundery
weather
all
day
no
lady
carloes
thank
you
i
just
go
straight
back
and
go
to
bed
i
wo
hear
of
anyone
coming
with
me
thanks
no
i
so
sorry
lady
carloes
i
shall
be
all
right
in
the
morning
yes
if
you
call
a
cab
please
no
uncle
richard
rather
not
she
was
better
she
knew
what
she
wanted
at
last
the
cab
was
there
but
it
was
not
york
terrace
that
she
had
commanded
but
saxton
square
it
was
lizzie
whom
she
needed
iv
it
was
a
long
drive
to
saxton
square
she
was
better
now
but
still
strangely
unwell
and
to
open
both
the
windows
was
of
no
use
not
a
breath
stirred
the
trees
dark
and
sombre
were
of
iron
the
lamps
gave
no
radiance
and
the
sky
was
black
she
was
terribly
frightened
frightened
because
here
in
the
dark
of
her
carriage
thoughts
of
breton
attacked
her
as
they
had
never
done
before
she
hid
her
face
in
her
burning
hands
her
body
was
shivering
breton
was
before
her
as
he
had
been
in
his
room
she
felt
his
hands
about
her
his
breath
on
her
cheek
his
mouth
was
pressed
against
hers
her
fingers
knew
again
the
stuff
of
his
coat
and
the
back
of
her
hand
had
touched
his
neck
and
yet
it
was
at
this
moment
with
those
very
memories
crowding
about
her
that
she
knew
definitely
and
with
absolute
assurance
that
it
was
roddy
and
roddy
only
in
all
the
world
whom
she
now
loved
her
passion
for
breton
had
been
a
passion
of
rebellion
of
discontent
a
moment
perhaps
in
her
education
that
carried
her
from
one
stage
to
another
she
loved
roddy
she
could
not
trace
the
steps
by
which
her
love
had
grown
but
affection
had
first
been
changed
into
something
stronger
on
that
day
when
he
had
been
carried
back
into
his
house
from
whose
gates
he
had
passed
that
morning
so
strong
and
sure
pity
had
been
the
beginning
of
it
admiration
of
his
courage
had
continued
it
this
moment
of
this
stormy
night
had
struck
it
into
flame
and
now
perhaps
in
another
day
or
so
she
would
learn
that
he
had
done
with
her
for
ever
she
sat
there
huddled
trembling
her
eyes
burning
her
throat
dry
oh
why
would
the
carriage
go
faster
if
only
this
storm
would
come
and
that
terrible
sky
would
break
she
knew
that
rand
and
daisy
were
away
in
the
country
and
lizzie
went
out
very
seldom
she
would
find
her
she
find
her
she
shuddered
to
think
what
she
might
do
were
lizzie
not
at
home
they
were
there
yes
miss
rand
was
at
home
rachel
went
in
lizzie
was
sitting
quietly
by
the
open
window
reading
she
looked
up
and
saw
rachel
in
a
dress
of
black
and
gold
her
face
very
pale
as
she
stood
there
in
the
doorway
lizzie
dear
lizzie
rachel
flung
off
her
cloak
stood
for
a
moment
motionless
then
without
another
word
huddled
up
on
to
the
sofa
and
her
face
buried
in
her
arm
began
to
cry
lizzie
came
across
to
her
took
her
hand
and
sat
there
without
speaking
after
a
long
time
she
said
rachel
dear
what
is
it
rachel
clung
to
her
holding
her
fiercely
at
last
looking
up
but
away
from
lizzie
she
said
oh
if
you
had
been
here
i
do
know
i
simply
do
know
what
i
think
it
this
night
this
awful
night
so
close
and
the
storm
is
so
long
coming
has
anything
particular
happened
yes
the
duchess
has
told
roddy
about
about
francis
or
i
think
she
has
roddy
said
nothing
to
me
but
i
ought
to
speak
to
him
to
tell
him
i
put
it
off
lizzie
said
softly
you
must
tell
him
rachel
you
know
that
you
must
it
the
only
thing
i
thought
it
would
come
to
that
sooner
or
later
but
it
more
than
that
i
not
well
i
do
know
what
it
is
but
i
never
felt
like
it
before
and
it
makes
me
more
frightened
than
i
ever
been
i
been
more
frightened
but
lizzie
was
thinking
has
your
grandmother
told
many
people
i
do
know
i
know
nothing
that
what
makes
it
so
hard
it
all
had
a
climax
there
was
an
awful
dinner
at
old
lady
and
it
was
so
hot
and
stuffy
that
i
nearly
fainted
i
had
to
leave
and
then
coming
here
rachel
began
to
tremble
again
and
creeping
close
to
lizzie
she
held
her
tighter
lizzie
in
the
cab
coming
here
francis
i
had
such
thoughts
i
could
have
believed
lizzie
eyes
gazed
out
into
the
square
far
away
not
like
a
pool
breton
all
hard
and
cruel
and
even
the
nymph
has
no
softness
she
kissed
rachel
it
the
night
dear
when
the
weather
like
this
it
affects
one
london
awful
there
be
such
a
storm
soon
but
it
worse
lizzie
i
seem
to
have
seen
myself
as
i
am
more
clearly
than
before
my
priggishness
talking
so
much
about
truth
and
then
the
things
i
do
roddy
francis
all
the
same
treated
them
all
badly
i
been
true
to
no
one
i
no
good
promise
me
dear
that
you
tell
him
your
husband
everything
promise
me
but
lizzie
perhaps
no
no
no
everything
he
hate
me
he
no
matter
you
must
rachel
was
silent
then
she
looked
into
lizzie
face
yes
she
said
i
will
then
with
a
little
sigh
she
fainted
v
when
she
rose
to
a
realization
of
life
again
she
was
lying
upon
bed
and
the
storm
had
broken
over
the
house
lizzie
was
holding
her
hand
the
thunder
roared
coming
with
stealthy
steps
closer
and
closer
sometimes
to
creep
stealthily
away
again
sometimes
to
break
with
crashing
splendour
upon
their
very
heads
the
lightning
flung
lizzie
bedroom
into
pale
brilliance
and
was
gone
life
leapt
into
vision
then
surrendered
to
the
candle
flare
then
leapt
again
rachel
smiled
faintly
she
felt
around
her
and
about
her
a
great
peace
she
knew
that
all
her
terror
had
departed
her
one
thought
now
was
to
return
to
roddy
and
tell
him
everything
she
sat
up
how
silly
of
me
to
faint
it
a
thing
i
never
done
in
my
life
how
you
get
me
here
the
maid
and
i
carried
you
in
it
better
for
you
in
here
i
think
i
go
now
lizzie
dear
wait
a
little
while
they
stayed
in
silence
then
they
heard
the
rain
that
lashed
the
windows
is
the
rain
terrific
oh
lizzie
it
all
gone
all
the
terror
all
that
awful
fright
she
added
solemnly
i
do
believe
i
ever
feel
like
that
again
it
never
come
back
i
sure
of
it
rachel
sat
silently
for
a
moment
then
turned
and
buried
her
head
in
lizzie
dress
lizzie
dear
i
been
so
frightened
of
something
else
of
what
i
going
to
have
a
child
i
known
it
for
some
time
at
first
i
was
sure
then
i
knew
i
was
frightened
and
miserable
then
as
with
every
day
i
seemed
to
grow
fonder
and
fonder
of
roddy
i
became
glad
about
it
then
very
happy
oh
rachel
dear
i
glad
yes
but
now
with
this
about
roddy
it
all
dreadful
again
if
he
should
turn
on
me
now
just
when
i
begun
to
care
she
sat
up
in
bed
her
eyes
staring
her
hands
clutching
the
clothes
lizzie
if
it
come
right
if
it
just
think
what
a
child
would
mean
for
him
he
so
brave
lying
there
all
day
making
himself
amused
and
interested
i
watch
him
often
and
wonder
where
all
that
courage
comes
from
could
have
done
it
but
now
if
the
child
a
boy
he
be
able
to
put
all
his
old
strength
and
keenness
into
and
the
place
think
what
it
will
mean
to
him
to
have
that
and
for
you
asked
lizzie
i
believe
it
what
i
wanted
oh
if
only
things
are
all
right
with
roddy
then
i
can
start
again
and
have
some
decent
pride
about
it
all
i
made
a
mess
of
things
so
far
they
talked
for
a
little
then
rachel
got
up
and
dressed
i
all
right
now
everything
seems
to
have
cleared
i
tell
roddy
everything
lizzie
dear
come
and
see
me
as
soon
as
ever
you
can
wo
you
i
will
rachel
said
good
night
she
held
lizzie
shoulders
lizzie
you
wonderful
do
think
i
do
know
how
wonderful
you
are
i
never
forget
what
you
been
and
if
it
all
right
oh
i
going
to
be
happy
that
all
right
said
lizzie
do
go
and
get
frightened
again
i
never
be
so
frightened
as
i
was
never
i
afraid
you
got
dreadfully
wet
she
said
to
the
cabman
it
do
matter
mum
but
it
come
down
lizzie
stood
in
the
doorway
and
waved
her
hand
the
rain
slashed
the
panes
and
whipped
the
shining
deserted
streets
very
far
away
the
faint
whisper
of
thunder
bade
the
town
farewell

i
that
afternoon
had
been
a
difficult
one
for
roddy
he
felt
lying
so
eternally
on
his
back
the
vagaries
of
the
english
weather
there
were
days
when
the
wind
was
in
the
park
when
sunshine
flashed
and
flung
shadows
when
the
water
of
the
pond
glittered
and
every
duck
and
baby
thrilled
with
life
then
it
was
very
hard
to
lie
still
and
memories
of
days
riding
days
and
swimming
days
and
hunting
days
would
persecute
him
but
there
were
dark
wet
hours
when
his
room
seemed
warm
and
cosy
then
he
was
happy
on
a
day
of
thunder
like
this
afternoon
his
one
desire
was
to
get
out
never
had
he
felt
the
bars
of
his
cage
so
sharply
with
so
intense
an
irritation
as
on
massiter
broke
the
chain
of
his
thoughts
and
he
was
glad
four
days
now
and
rachel
had
said
nothing
many
times
he
had
thought
that
she
was
going
to
speak
but
the
moments
had
passed
he
had
not
slept
for
two
nights
over
and
over
he
turned
the
question
as
to
what
he
was
to
do
had
he
been
up
and
about
some
solution
would
have
naturally
come
he
thought
but
lying
here
thinking
so
interminably
with
one
body
tied
to
one
like
a
stone
nothing
seemed
clear
or
easy
this
was
the
worst
day
in
the
world
to
make
thinking
simple
the
leaden
sky
pressed
one
down
and
held
one
brain
i
goin
to
have
a
jolly
bad
evenin
said
roddy
i
know
i
am
massiter
was
a
relief
there
was
no
need
to
talk
whilst
massiter
was
there
and
his
fat
cheerful
body
restored
one
balance
the
same
sensible
world
that
had
once
been
roddy
own
and
had
of
late
slipped
away
from
him
was
restored
when
massiter
was
there
nevertheless
one
hour
of
massiter
was
enough
roddy
could
detect
in
massiter
attitude
that
pity
moved
him
to
additional
cheerfulness
and
this
was
irritating
then
massiter
clumsy
efforts
to
avoid
topics
that
might
be
especially
tactless
that
also
was
tiresome
roddy
was
glad
when
rachel
and
john
beaminster
came
down
and
relieved
him
and
then
the
moment
arrived
when
he
thought
again
that
rachel
was
going
to
speak
and
perhaps
if
he
had
made
a
movement
of
affection
he
would
have
caught
her
but
always
when
some
expression
of
feeling
was
especially
demanded
of
him
did
he
feel
the
least
able
to
produce
it
the
whole
relationship
between
them
depended
on
such
slender
incidents
one
word
from
anybody
and
there
would
be
no
more
confusion
or
doubt
the
situation
had
the
maddening
indecision
of
a
dream
i
going
to
have
a
bad
time
he
thought
it
no
use
giving
in
to
the
thing
he
faced
it
deliberately
if
only
he
could
think
clearly
but
the
damned
weather
well
he
and
jacob
must
face
the
night
as
best
they
could
the
dog
lay
flat
near
the
window
moving
restlessly
under
the
close
air
but
pricking
his
ears
at
every
movement
that
roddy
made
ready
to
come
to
him
at
any
instant
that
old
dog
cares
for
me
more
than
anyone
else
does
and
i
only
appreciated
him
after
i
was
laid
up
rummy
thing
roddy
was
conscious
that
high
above
him
somewhere
near
the
ceiling
hovered
a
creature
born
of
this
damnable
evening
and
that
did
he
allow
himself
to
relax
for
a
moment
down
that
hovering
creature
would
come
very
faintly
as
it
were
from
a
great
distance
he
could
catch
its
whisper
in
his
ear
what
the
good
of
this
what
the
good
of
this
what
did
you
always
say
what
would
you
have
said
about
anyone
placed
as
you
are
now
better
for
him
to
get
out
damn
you
shut
up
he
was
in
great
physical
pain
the
pain
that
always
came
to
him
when
he
was
tired
out
but
that
was
nothing
to
the
mental
torture
twisted
figures
rachel
breton
himself
the
duchess
passed
before
him
mingling
separating
sometimes
coming
to
him
as
though
they
were
there
with
him
in
the
room
he
had
not
even
on
the
day
that
had
told
him
that
he
would
never
get
up
again
felt
so
near
to
utter
defeat
as
he
was
now
he
had
been
proud
of
himself
proud
of
his
resistance
to
what
with
another
man
might
have
appeared
utter
catastrophe
proud
of
his
dogged
determination
to
have
the
devil
beat
this
same
devil
was
going
to
be
too
much
for
him
did
he
not
fight
his
very
hardest
and
the
cruelty
of
it
was
that
this
weather
took
all
one
vitality
out
of
one
drained
one
dry
left
one
a
rag
curse
you
get
out
he
muttered
clenching
his
teeth
then
whistled
and
brought
jacob
instantly
to
his
side
the
dog
jumped
on
to
the
long
sofa
taking
care
not
to
touch
his
master
legs
then
he
moved
up
into
the
hollow
of
roddy
arm
and
lay
there
warm
against
roddy
side
what
the
use
the
creature
was
close
to
him
his
breath
warm
and
damp
like
the
night
air
she
does
care
for
you
you
can
see
that
she
does
she
been
in
love
with
her
cousin
for
ever
so
long
only
you
did
know
would
she
have
told
you
that
she
was
a
friend
of
his
if
there
had
been
nothing
more
than
that
in
it
what
a
fool
you
are
lying
here
all
broken
up
simply
in
the
way
of
her
happiness
no
good
to
yourself
or
anyone
else
i
wish
the
thunder
would
come
and
smash
you
up
then
more
desperately
what
if
that
right
if
i
were
to
clear
out
after
all
said
the
creature
you
never
before
seen
yourself
as
you
really
are
you
thought
that
you
were
all
right
because
you
could
use
your
legs
and
arms
now
you
know
what
you
are
you
nothing
only
something
that
many
people
must
trouble
to
keep
alive
useless
useless
why
not
yes
roddy
did
see
himself
sternly
as
in
the
old
days
he
might
have
looked
upon
someone
and
judged
him
unfit
so
now
he
would
confront
himself
it
quite
true
you
got
nothing
nothing
to
show
you
no
intellect
you
selfish
you
despise
all
kinds
of
people
for
all
kinds
of
reasons
you
stood
a
little
pain
so
can
any
man
better
get
out
no
one
will
know
yes
said
the
creature
very
close
to
him
now
you
can
do
it
so
easily
that
morphia
that
you
had
once
or
twice
an
overdose
no
one
would
suppose
she
would
never
know
and
you
be
rid
for
ever
of
all
this
wrong
and
you
free
so
many
people
from
so
much
trouble
jacob
my
son
he
whispered
do
you
hear
what
they
saying
he
went
right
down
down
to
the
depths
of
a
pit
that
closed
about
his
head
filled
his
eyes
with
darkness
was
suffocating
yes
he
beaten
he
heard
them
say
we
succeeded
at
last
succeeded
but
they
had
not
with
an
effort
of
will
that
was
beyond
any
power
that
he
had
believed
himself
to
possess
he
pulled
himself
up
there
one
thing
you
forgotten
he
gasped
as
he
came
struggling
up
he
took
the
creature
in
his
hands
wrung
its
neck
and
flung
it
out
of
the
window
there
one
thing
you
forgotten
there
my
love
for
her
strong
enough
for
anything
that
reason
enough
for
living
even
though
she
does
want
it
i
beat
you
all
with
that
go
back
to
hell
the
lot
of
you
ii
i
must
never
let
it
happen
like
that
again
what
a
state
this
weather
can
get
one
into
but
he
had
come
back
to
his
senses
his
brain
was
clear
he
could
think
now
the
great
point
was
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
think
of
himself
in
this
affair
rachel
rachel
the
only
thing
that
matters
then
upon
that
came
the
decision
that
old
woman
got
to
pay
for
it
she
been
wantin
to
give
rachel
a
bad
time
she
tried
to
her
mouth
got
to
be
stopped
old
and
ill
she
is
he
was
fiercely
furiously
indignant
with
her
vanished
it
appeared
all
his
affection
the
sentiment
of
years
i
got
to
defend
rachel
from
her
no
knowin
she
been
tellin
roddy
still
found
it
impossible
to
admit
more
than
one
idea
at
a
time
and
the
idea
now
was
that
he
must
stop
the
old
lady
dead
his
brain
came
round
now
to
breton
and
halted
there
what
kind
of
fellow
after
all
was
he
what
after
all
did
roddy
know
about
him
that
he
could
so
easily
condemn
him
fresh
from
the
battle
with
the
creature
roddy
view
of
the
world
was
painted
with
new
colours
the
man
had
been
condemned
for
things
that
his
father
had
done
and
one
recognized
here
in
london
how
difficult
it
was
for
a
fellow
to
climb
up
once
he
had
been
pushed
down
was
the
man
in
love
with
rachel
well
roddy
did
not
know
that
he
could
blame
him
for
that
difficult
enough
surely
for
anyone
not
to
be
but
he
what
after
all
was
he
like
then
swiftly
the
answer
came
to
him
see
the
man
talk
to
him
know
him
he
stared
at
the
idea
felt
already
new
energy
in
his
bones
and
a
surging
victory
over
the
lethargy
of
this
awful
evening
at
the
suggestion
of
some
definite
action
but
see
him
yes
and
see
him
here
and
see
him
soon
his
impatience
leapt
now
hotly
upon
him
he
pulled
jacob
ears
that
the
ticket
old
boy
ai
it
see
what
kind
of
a
ruffian
this
is
my
word
but
would
the
old
lady
hate
it
if
she
knew
but
and
at
this
the
room
flared
with
the
thrill
of
it
why
not
have
her
here
to
meet
him
confront
her
with
him
he
was
cool
now
here
was
matter
that
needed
careful
handling
still
as
vigorous
now
as
in
his
most
active
days
was
his
impatience
was
something
in
the
way
cobwebs
barriers
obstacles
of
any
sort
brush
them
aside
beat
them
down
here
was
a
plan
here
too
most
happily
at
hand
was
the
punishment
all
these
years
had
the
old
lady
been
refusing
to
set
eyes
upon
her
grandson
therefore
how
dramatic
would
it
be
were
she
confronted
with
him
unexpectedly
out
of
the
heart
of
that
meeting
would
come
most
assuredly
the
truth
about
rachel
there
in
a
flash
solid
substantial
beautifully
compact
magnificently
splendid
his
plan
lay
before
him
he
would
have
them
there
rachel
the
duchess
this
breton
all
of
them
there
before
him
they
should
come
ignorant
unprepared
breton
first
then
rachel
then
the
duchess
having
them
there
he
would
quite
simply
say
that
someone
had
been
pouring
into
his
ears
a
story
of
friendship
to
which
he
might
take
objection
he
would
then
very
quietly
but
here
he
paused
oh
he
knew
what
he
would
do
he
smiled
at
the
thought
of
the
success
of
his
plan
when
he
had
made
his
little
speech
to
them
all
there
would
never
again
be
any
danger
of
scandal
the
old
lady
would
never
again
have
any
single
word
to
say
the
thought
that
rachel
might
be
angry
at
his
deceptive
plot
did
not
disturb
him
when
she
had
heard
his
little
speech
she
would
not
say
that
and
here
suddenly
he
knew
how
deeply
in
his
heart
he
trusted
her
but
what
if
after
all
it
should
be
a
lie
on
the
old
lady
part
was
he
not
doing
wrong
to
take
things
so
far
without
a
question
to
anyone
else
christopher
or
lizzie
rand
but
this
was
roddy
here
both
his
pride
and
his
impatience
were
concerned
he
did
not
wish
that
the
business
should
pass
beyond
its
present
bounds
he
could
not
go
from
person
to
person
asking
them
whether
they
trusted
his
wife
and
then
he
could
not
wait
here
was
a
plan
that
killed
the
danger
at
one
blow
something
direct
open
with
sharply
defined
issues
oh
rachel
should
see
how
he
loved
her
all
these
days
he
said
to
jacob
i
been
worryin
about
her
but
i
knew
yes
i
knew
that
she
was
comin
to
me
all
right
he
thought
of
a
day
long
before
and
of
miss
nita
raseley
and
of
a
meeting
in
the
garden
i
show
her
that
i
can
forgive
too
if
it
necessary
not
because
i
care
so
little
but
by
god
because
i
care
so
much
no
he
thought
shaking
his
head
over
it
she
does
love
me
not
yet
but
beginnin
to
belong
to
me
she
coming
there
was
also
the
thought
that
the
duchess
was
an
old
sick
woman
and
that
the
scene
might
be
too
much
for
her
strength
not
she
he
grimly
decided
that
the
kind
of
thing
she
lives
on
anyway
i
owe
her
one
did
do
her
any
harm
comin
to
me
the
other
day
wo
do
her
any
harm
now
know
her
his
scheme
must
be
carried
out
at
once
he
felt
that
he
could
not
wait
a
moment
he
would
have
liked
to
have
had
them
all
there
before
him
why
by
this
time
old
boy
it
will
all
be
straight
thank
god
my
brain
cleared
in
spite
of
this
damn
weather
he
rang
the
bell
and
peters
large
solemn
but
bending
a
loving
eye
upon
his
master
appeared
writing
things
peters
he
wrote
swiftly
two
notes
very
close
sir
yes
peters
very
you
looking
better
sir
less
tired
your
dinner
will
be
up
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour

omelette

little
bird
nice
fruit

sardines
on
toast
thank
you
peters
i
hungry
as
as

very
glad

want

two
notes
sent
by
hand
instantly
do
you
see
yes
sir
at
once
yes
sir
roddy
lay
back
and
surveyed
the
black
sky
nasty
storm
comin
up
look
here
peters
give
me
that
bird
book
over
there
that
big
one
thanks
peters
retired
iii
meanwhile
her
grace
had
found
this
close
evening
very
trying
that
visit
to
roddy
had
not
harmed
her
physically
but
had
made
her
restless
the
very
fact
that
it
had
not
hurt
her
urged
her
to
have
more
of
such
evenings
having
shown
them
once
what
she
could
do
she
would
like
to
show
them
all
again
and
yet
with
this
new
energy
was
also
lethargy
so
that
she
sat
thinking
about
her
adventures
but
felt
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
move
then
this
thundery
afternoon
really
did
drag
the
strength
from
her
she
allowed
her
fire
to
fall
into
a
few
golden
coals
she
allowed
dorchester
to
move
her
from
her
chair
on
to
a
sofa
that
was
near
the
wide
window
now
flung
open
she
could
see
roofs
chimneys
towers
of
churches
all
dingy
grey
beneath
the
leaden
sky
she
lay
there
a
book
on
her
lap
but
not
reading
she
was
thinking
of
roddy
for
perhaps
the
very
first
time
in
all
her
life
she
regretted
something
that
she
had
done
nobody
but
roddy
could
have
called
this
regret
out
of
her
and
now
she
would
confess
it
to
no
living
soul
but
she
lay
there
thinking
about
it
remembering
every
movement
and
gesture
of
his
seeing
always
that
at
the
end
he
had
wanted
her
to
go
had
as
her
sharp
old
eyes
had
seen
hurried
her
away
there
had
been
so
splendid
a
chance
she
had
shown
her
love
for
him
so
magnificently
that
he
could
not
but
have
been
touched
and
moved
had
she
only
left
rachel
alone
ah
that
girl
again
again
the
duchess
looked
at
the
plain
roofs
that
lay
dry
and
sterile
beneath
the
torrid
sky
and
wished
not
by
any
means
for
the
first
time
that
she
had
left
that
marriage
with
roddy
alone
roddy
would
have
married
some
other
girl
nita
raseley
or
such
and
he
would
have
been
mine
mine
hard
and
utterly
selfish
in
all
her
ordinary
dealings
with
a
world
that
she
professed
to
despise
but
really
adored
her
love
for
roddy
was
a
little
golden
link
to
a
thousand
softnesses
and
as
she
termed
them
weak
indulgences
why
had
she
loved
him
so
she
was
like
the
grim
pirate
of
some
conventional
fiction
see
him
on
his
dark
vessel
surveying
with
cold
and
cruel
eye
the
beautiful
captives
provided
by
the
stricken
ship
on
every
side
of
him
see
him
select
for
the
very
flavour
that
the
contrast
gave
him
some
ordinary
slave
from
the
crowd
to
whom
he
shows
weak
indulgence
so
much
blacker
he
feels
does
this
kindness
make
his
infamies
but
the
duchess
career
as
the
dark
pirate
of
her
period
was
swiftly
vanishing
the
black
hulk
of
her
vessel
remained
but
upon
its
boards
only
the
little
slave
was
to
be
seen
and
even
he
with
furtive
eye
sought
his
way
of
escape
yes
on
this
torrid
evening
every
soul
in
that
vast
city
surely
felt
that
he
was
alone
abandoned
in
a
desert
of
a
world
but
the
fear
that
she
was
losing
even
roddy
brought
the
duchess
very
close
to
panic
she
had
not
grasped
before
how
resolutely
she
had
been
using
him
to
bolster
up
life
for
her
how
important
his
friendly
existence
was
for
her
since
his
marriage
that
friendliness
had
grown
with
every
hour
weaker
something
she
must
do
now
to
repair
her
error
of
the
other
day
she
was
even
ready
to
pretend
affection
for
her
granddaughter
if
that
would
bring
roddy
back
to
her
she
watched
the
sky
and
longed
for
the
threatened
storm
to
break
her
bones
were
indeed
old
and
feeble
to
move
at
all
was
an
effort
and
with
it
all
there
was
a
sense
of
apprehension
as
though
she
were
some
terrified
bird
conscious
of
the
hawk
approach
she
who
had
until
now
been
herself
the
hawk
she
remembered
the
day
when
she
had
realized
more
poignantly
than
ever
before
that
the
hour
must
come
and
indeed
was
not
far
away
when
she
would
inevitably
meet
death
she
had
loathed
that
realization
attempted
to
defy
it
been
defeated
by
it
now
on
this
evening
she
suspected
again
the
invasion
of
that
same
power
but
there
was
no
resistance
in
her
she
lay
there
whitely
submitting
to
the
tyranny
of
any
enemy
she
could
scarcely
breathe
london
like
a
scaly
dragon
flung
its
hot
breath
upon
her
and
withered
her
defiance
she
would
have
moved
away
from
the
window
had
not
those
grey
roofs
held
her
by
their
ugly
indifference
with
a
terrible
fascination
i
going
i
going
and
they
do
care
just
like
that
just
like
that
long
after
i
gone
the
evening
slipped
away
and
dorchester
coming
to
her
thought
that
she
was
sleeping
she
did
not
disturb
her
but
ordered
her
evening
meal
to
be
kept
until
she
should
wake
the
duchess
did
sleep
she
awoke
to
find
in
the
sky
above
the
now
vanishing
roofs
a
golden
glow
and
in
the
room
behind
her
the
shaded
lamps
the
fire
burning
and
her
table
spread
but
she
had
had
a
horrible
dream
she
struggled
to
recall
it
and
even
as
she
struggled
trembling
seized
her
body
as
the
vague
horror
that
it
had
left
behind
it
still
thrilled
and
troubled
her
she
could
recollect
nothing
of
her
dream
except
this
that
she
had
died
and
that
being
dead
she
was
immediately
aware
that
god
awaited
her
she
could
remember
her
frantic
effort
to
reassert
all
those
earthly
convictions
that
had
been
based
on
the
definite
creed
that
the
duchess
existed
but
god
she
had
still
with
her
the
sensation
of
hurry
and
dismay
the
dismal
knowledge
that
she
had
only
a
moment
with
which
to
break
down
the
discoveries
of
a
lifetime
and
place
new
ones
in
her
stead
she
had
above
all
the
horrible
knowledge
that
her
punishment
was
settled
that
at
last
she
was
in
the
hands
of
a
power
stronger
than
herself
and
that
nothing
nothing
nothing
could
help
her
she
was
frightened
but
she
knew
not
by
what
or
by
whom
she
tried
to
tell
herself
that
she
had
been
dreaming
that
this
breathless
evening
was
responsible
that
she
would
be
all
right
very
soon
but
she
was
seized
by
that
terrible
vague
uncertainty
that
had
been
with
her
so
much
lately
uncertainty
as
to
what
was
real
and
what
was
not
she
looked
at
the
french
novel
lying
upon
her
lap
that
was
real
she
supposed
and
yet
as
she
touched
its
pages
her
fingers
seemed
to
seize
upon
nothing
only
air
between
them
the
fits
of
trembling
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
and
yet
she
could
scarcely
breathe
so
close
and
heavy
was
the
night
that
was
only
a
dream
only
a
dream
suppose
it
should
be
true
though
what
if
i
to
die
dorchester
came
to
her
and
was
alarmed
dinner
is
ready
your
grace
her
mistress
did
not
answer
but
lay
there
looking
through
the
open
window
and
shivering
your
grace
will
catch
cold
by
that
open
window
i
had
better
close
it
it
stifling
stifling
will
you
have
dinner
now
no
no
why
do
you
worry
me
i
can
eat
nothing
dorchester
was
seriously
alarmed
an
evening
like
this
might
very
easily
she
determined
to
send
word
round
to
christopher
she
went
away
gave
directions
about
the
dinner
saw
that
her
bedroom
was
warm
and
comfortable
she
came
back
the
duchess
was
sitting
up
colour
in
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
sparkling
on
her
lap
lay
a
note
i
had
a
dream
dorchester
a
horrid
dream
i
was
disturbed
for
a
moment
i
think
i
will
eat
something
after
all
the
way
she
goes
up
and
down
thought
dorchester
must
say
i
like
the
look
of
her
not
knowing
her
own
mind
so
unlike
her
who
the
letter
from
i
wonder
it
was
the
letter
plainly
that
had
done
it
sitting
up
and
enjoying
her
soup
forgetting
that
black
sky
and
the
dragon
scaly
menace
the
duchess
knew
that
that
dream
that
dream
about
god
had
been
as
silly
as
futile
as
dreams
always
are
the
note
brought
to
her
by
norris
and
lying
now
beside
her
plate
had
told
her
so
the
note
of
course
had
been
from
roddy
it
said
dear
duchess
i
do
want
to
ask
anything
impossible
of
you
but
encouraged
by
your
coming
to
me
the
other
day
and
hearing
that
you
took
no
harm
from
your
expedition
i
am
wondering
whether
afternoon
about
five
you
could
come
again
and
have
tea
with
me
there
is
something
about
which
you
can
help
me
only
you
in
all
the
world
if
i
do
hear
from
you
i
will
conclude
that
you
can
come
five
your
affectionate
friend
roddy
that
letter
showed
the
perfection
of
his
tactful
understanding
no
absurd
talk
about
her
age
her
feebleness
the
weather
but
simply
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
of
course
she
would
be
there
well
of
course
she
be
there
nothing
should
stop
her
she
was
aware
that
christopher
hearing
that
she
had
not
been
so
well
would
certainly
forbid
her
to
move
he
should
therefore
know
nothing
about
it
nothing
at
all
his
visit
would
be
paid
in
the
morning
she
would
have
the
afternoon
to
herself
norris
and
dorchester
should
help
her
to
the
carriage
christopher
expected
on
his
arrival
to
find
her
in
a
very
bad
way
exhausted
by
the
closeness
of
the
evening
it
was
possible
that
he
might
have
to
remain
all
night
he
found
her
in
bed
a
lace
cap
on
her
head
a
crimson
about
her
shoulders
and
all
her
rings
glittering
upon
her
fingers
an
massive
silver
candlestick
with
six
branches
illuminated
the
lacquer
bed
the
black
indian
chairs
the
fantastic
the
windows
were
closed
and
the
dry
heat
of
the
room
was
appalling
she
was
in
her
mildest
most
amiable
mood
had
enjoyed
an
excellent
dinner
laughed
her
cracked
discordant
laugh
was
delighted
to
see
him
sit
down
there
close
to
me
have
some
coffee
no
thank
you
dorchester
can
bring
it
in
a
minute
no
really
thank
you
who
sent
for
you
lord
john
yes
i
thought
so
pretty
state
of
things
with
them
all
hanging
round
like
this
waiting
for
me
to
die
never
felt
better
in
my
life
so
i
see
delighted
i
go
not
a
bit
of
it
stay
and
talk
i
feel
like
telling
someone
what
i
think
of
things
although
you
heard
it
all
often
enough
before
but
the
truth
is
christopher
i
have
a
nasty
dream
a
very
nasty
dream
and
the
nastiest
part
of
it
was
that
i
could
remember
it
when
i
woke
up
but
it
the
weather
i
was
frightened
for
a
minute
although
i
have
anyone
else
know
but
you
had
a
good
dinner
splendid
dinner
thank
you
she
lay
back
in
bed
and
looked
at
him
delightful
to
think
that
she
would
play
a
little
game
with
him
he
would
in
all
probability
be
angry
when
he
knew
that
would
be
very
amusing
delightful
too
to
think
that
just
when
she
was
afraid
that
she
had
seriously
alienated
roddy
away
from
her
he
should
write
and
say
that
he
needed
her
she
would
go
and
would
be
exceedingly
pleasant
to
him
and
would
reassure
him
about
rachel
yes
she
had
seldom
felt
so
genial
she
told
christopher
stories
of
men
and
women
whom
she
had
known
wicked
stories
gay
stories
cruel
stories
and
her
eyes
twinkled
and
her
fingers
sparkled
and
her
old
withered
face
poked
out
above
the
with
the
white
hair
fine
and
proud
beneath
the
lace
cap
once
she
said
to
him
you
think
all
this
queer
do
you
waving
her
hand
at
the
bed
the
chairs
the
paper
this
colour
and
the
odds
and
ends
and
the
rest
it
part
of
you
he
said
i
should
know
you
without
them
i
love
them
she
breathed
i
them
oh
if
i
had
my
way
have
been
born
when
one
could
have
up
and
splashed
it
about
and
had
it
everywhere
jewels
clothes
processions
ah
that
why
i
hate
this
generation
that
coming
the
generation
that
you
believe
in
so
devoutly
it
so
ugly
it
wears
ugly
things
it
likes
ugly
people
it
believes
in
talking
about
ugly
morals
and
making
ugly
laws
then
she
laughed
it
funny
is
it
i
had
to
use
the
age
i
was
born
into
i
cut
my
cloth
to
it
but
what
a
figure
i
have
made
in
any
century
before
the
nineteenth
all
the
old
times
were
best
you
could
command
and
see
that
you
were
obeyed
none
of
your
individualism
then
christopher
she
was
silent
for
a
time
and
he
said
nothing
he
was
thinking
about
breton
wondering
where
he
was
feeling
that
he
should
not
have
let
him
go
she
said
suddenly
christopher
do
you
think
there
a
god
i
know
there
is
well
i
know
there
is
so
there
we
are
one
of
us
will
find
that
we
made
a
mistake
in
a
few
years
time
he
said
nothing
at
last
she
began
again
you
sure
of
it
quite
sure
so
like
you
and
you
get
a
deal
of
comfort
from
it
no
doubt
but
what
kind
of
a
god
christopher
a
just
god
a
loving
god
how
any
doctor
can
say
that
truthfully
the
pain
the
crime
you
must
have
seen
exactly
i
known
i
suppose
of
as
much
misery
as
much
agony
much
wickedness
as
most
men
in
a
lifetime
i
never
had
a
case
under
my
notice
that
has
shown
the
necessity
for
pain
the
necessity
for
struggle
for
defeat
for
disaster
if
this
life
were
all
still
i
should
have
had
proof
enough
that
a
loving
god
was
moving
in
the
world
she
lay
back
smiling
at
him
you
a
sentimentalist
of
course
i
heard
you
talk
before
wrong
christopher
badly
wrong
i
shall
prove
it
before
you
will
well
he
said
smiling
back
at
her
we
see
oh
yes
you
a
sentimentalist
of
the
very
worst
i
do
know
that
i
like
you
the
less
for
it
i
an
old
pagan
and
it
served
me
all
my
life
ah
there
the
thunder
she
sat
up
in
bed
her
cap
pushed
back
her
skinny
arms
stretched
out
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
there
that
it
that
the
kind
of
thing
i
like
there
your
god
for
you
christopher
a
flash
of
lightning
flung
the
room
into
unreality
i
hoped
for
one
more
good
storm
before
i
went
i
been
waiting
all
day
for
this
he
never
forgot
the
strange
figure
that
she
made
she
displayed
the
excitement
of
a
child
presented
with
a
sudden
unexpected
gift
he
himself
had
known
many
storms
but
perhaps
because
she
now
made
so
strange
a
central
figure
of
this
one
this
always
remained
with
him
as
the
worst
of
his
life
he
had
never
heard
such
thunder
and
as
each
crash
fell
upon
them
he
felt
that
she
rose
to
it
and
exulted
in
it
as
though
she
were
a
swimmer
meeting
great
ocean
rollers
there
was
at
last
a
peal
that
broke
upon
them
as
though
it
had
tumbled
the
whole
house
about
their
ears
deafened
by
it
he
looked
about
him
as
though
he
had
expected
to
find
everything
in
the
room
shattered
was
the
best
she
cried
to
him
at
last
she
lay
back
tired
and
he
bade
her
good
night
she
held
his
hand
for
a
moment
i
regret
nothing
she
said
nothing
at
all
i
had
a
good
time
but
after
he
had
left
her
the
sound
of
the
rain
had
some
personal
fury
about
it
that
made
her
uneasy
she
called
to
dorchester
i
think
i
like
you
to
sleep
here
dorchester
i
may
need
you
very
well
your
grace
after
all
she
thought
as
the
candles
blown
out
she
lay
and
listened
to
the
rain
that
dream
may
come
back
chapter

i
the
storm
savagely
retreating
left
blue
skies
spring
and
the
greenest
grass
the
parks
had
ever
displayed
behind
it
roddy
lying
before
his
window
watched
the
pond
gleaming
like
blue
grass
but
crisped
by
the
breeze
into
a
thousand
ripples
two
babies
ran
tumbled
screamed
and
shouted
and
all
the
ducks
the
ducks
with
red
bills
the
ducks
with
draggled
feathers
the
ducks
in
grey
and
brown
chattered
beneath
the
sun
by
midday
a
note
had
arrived
from
breton
saying
that
he
would
be
with
roddy
at
four
there
was
no
word
from
the
duchess
he
knew
therefore
that
his
plan
had
prospered
but
with
those
morning
reflections
that
freeze
so
remorselessly
the
hot
decisions
of
the
night
before
he
was
afraid
of
what
he
had
done
he
was
afraid
of
rachel
he
was
afraid
of
rachel
because
he
recognized
now
that
he
was
on
the
brink
of
this
plunge
how
much
deeper
and
more
dangerous
it
might
be
for
him
than
he
had
thought
during
these
last
months
he
had
been
slowly
capturing
rachel
that
capture
was
the
one
ambition
and
desire
of
his
life
but
in
the
very
intensity
and
ardour
of
his
desire
he
had
learnt
more
surely
than
ever
the
strange
contradictions
that
made
her
character
his
accident
had
increased
his
own
age
and
so
emphasized
her
youth
she
was
ever
so
young
ever
so
impulsive
her
seriousness
was
the
seriousness
of
some
very
youthful
spirit
who
guessing
at
the
terrific
difficulty
of
life
feels
that
the
only
way
to
surmount
it
is
to
close
eyes
blindly
and
leap
over
the
whole
of
it
at
once
this
was
what
he
knew
in
his
heart
although
he
would
never
have
put
it
into
words
as
her
adorable
priggishness
she
had
found
her
solution
and
everything
must
fit
into
it
but
since
she
had
finally
resolved
it
nothing
would
fit
into
it
at
all
and
there
was
the
whole
of
rachel
young
history
to
roddy
one
thing
manifest
was
that
a
very
tiny
blunder
might
shatter
the
bond
that
was
forming
between
them
and
it
was
eloquent
of
a
great
deal
that
whereas
before
in
the
nita
raseley
episode
it
had
been
rachel
who
feared
the
one
false
step
it
was
now
roddy
what
it
came
to
was
that
in
spite
of
everything
he
was
still
unable
to
prophesy
about
her
she
was
still
unrealized
almost
untouched
by
him
that
was
partly
why
he
loved
her
so
roddy
brain
had
been
alive
last
night
and
ready
to
grapple
with
anything
he
felt
stupid
and
confused
we
in
for
a
jolly
good
row
he
thought
far
as
i
can
see
there
no
avoidin
it
anyway
some
clearin
up
will
come
out
of
all
of
it
so
intent
was
he
upon
rachel
that
he
scarcely
considered
the
duchess
he
had
not
very
much
imagination
about
people
and
made
the
english
mistake
of
believing
that
everyone
else
saw
life
as
he
did
he
had
for
that
very
reason
never
believed
very
seriously
in
the
duchess
passion
for
himself
he
liked
her
indeed
for
her
hardness
and
resented
any
appearance
of
the
gentler
motions
she
like
tellin
us
all
what
she
thinks
of
it
placed
in
the
afternoon
battle
he
might
have
taken
it
all
had
he
chosen
as
the
most
curious
circumstance
that
he
should
be
arranging
things
eloquent
of
the
changed
order
of
his
life
and
of
the
new
man
that
he
was
becoming
he
lay
there
all
the
morning
nervous
and
restless
rachel
had
looked
in
for
a
moment
and
had
told
him
that
she
was
going
to
see
christopher
that
she
might
not
return
to
luncheon
he
had
fancied
that
in
those
few
moments
he
had
divined
in
her
some
especial
thrill
we
all
going
to
be
tuned
up
this
afternoon
if
he
found
and
this
was
the
question
that
he
asked
himself
most
urgently
that
rachel
really
had
in
the
competent
interpretation
of
the
term
deserted
him
for
breton
what
would
be
his
sensations
being
an
englishman
he
would
of
course
horsewhip
the
fellow
divorce
rachel
and
lead
a
misanthropic
but
sensual
existence
for
the
rest
of
his
days
but
here
the
wild
strain
in
roddy
counted
that
is
exactly
what
roddy
would
not
do
what
was
law
for
the
man
must
be
law
also
for
the
woman
he
had
on
an
earlier
day
told
her
that
were
he
to
present
her
with
a
thousand
infidelities
yet
he
would
love
her
best
and
most
truly
and
therefore
she
must
forgive
him
well
that
should
be
true
too
for
her
any
episode
with
breton
seemed
only
an
incident
in
the
pursuit
of
her
that
roddy
had
commenced
on
that
day
that
he
had
married
her
and
yet
was
not
this
readiness
on
his
part
to
forgive
her
sprung
from
his
conviction
that
she
would
have
told
him
had
she
had
so
much
to
confess
to
him
let
her
relations
with
breton
remain
uncertain
and
shifting
then
she
might
have
found
justification
for
her
silence
let
them
once
have
found
so
definite
a
climax
and
she
must
have
spoken
roddy
had
indeed
advanced
in
his
knowledge
both
of
her
and
himself
since
two
years
ago
by
the
early
afternoon
he
was
in
a
pitiable
state
should
he
send
notes
to
the
duchess
and
breton
telling
them
both
that
he
was
too
unwell
too
cross
too
sleepy
too
anything
to
see
them
should
he
retire
to
bed
and
leave
peters
to
make
his
excuses
should
he
disappear
and
tell
rachel
to
deal
with
them
a
scene
there
be
between
the
three
of
them
his
illness
had
made
a
difference
to
his
nerve
lying
there
on
back
took
the
grit
away
gave
one
too
much
time
to
think
showed
one
such
momentous
issues
on
the
events
of
this
afternoon
might
hang
all
his
life
and
all
rachel
his
capture
of
her
was
indeed
now
to
be
put
to
the
test
ii
rachel
came
into
his
room
at
four
she
carried
a
great
bunch
of
violets
and
a
paper
parcel
she
smiled
across
the
room
at
him
a
cap
of
white
fur
on
her
head
and
the
hand
with
the
violets
held
also
a
large
white
muff
roddy
i
coming
to
have
tea
with
you
alone
you
be
out
to
everyone
wo
you
but
first
see
what
i
brought
you
she
was
dreadfully
excited
he
thought
as
though
she
knew
already
the
kind
of
thing
that
awaited
her
her
smile
was
nervous
and
that
trembling
of
her
upper
lip
as
though
she
would
perhaps
cry
and
perhaps
would
laugh
but
really
was
not
sure
always
told
him
when
she
was
afraid
see
what
i
brought
you
she
put
the
violets
down
upon
the
table
beside
him
now
look
she
undid
the
paper
and
held
up
to
his
gaze
a
deep
gleaming
silver
lustre
bowl
a
beautiful
bowl
because
of
its
instant
friendliness
and
richness
and
completeness
i
found
it
she
said
staring
at
me
out
of
a
shop
window
demanding
to
be
bought
i
thought
you
like
it
she
put
it
on
his
table
found
water
and
filled
it
then
arranged
the
violets
in
it
oh
my
dear
it
beautiful
he
said
and
then
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
face
watched
her
arrange
the
flowers
but
he
brought
out
at
last
i
afraid
i
ca
promise
to
be
alone
for
tea
oh
she
stepped
back
from
the
flowers
and
looked
at
him
they
faced
one
another
the
silver
bowl
between
them
she
stood
as
she
always
did
when
she
had
something
difficult
to
face
her
long
hands
straight
at
her
side
her
hands
slowly
closing
and
unclosing
her
eyes
fixed
upon
some
far
distance
roddy
please
she
said
i
do
want
to
be
alone
with
you
this
afternoon
i
have
a
special
very
special
reason
i
want
to
talk
you
see
he
said
no
she
cried
impatiently
we
have
this
afternoon
to
ourselves
tell
peters
that
you
too
ill
too
tired
anything
sure
after
all
that
storm
last
night
it
would
be
perfectly
natural
if
you
were
now
please
roddy
i
awfully
sorry
rachel
dear
if
i
only
known
if
you
only
told
me
last
night
i
did
know
myself
last
night
how
could
i
but
now
it
most
awfully
important
roddy
i
i
something
to
tell
you
his
heart
beat
thickly
his
eyes
shone
well
they
wo
stay
long
i
dare
say
who
are
they
oh
nobody
special
friends
then
if
they
put
them
off
roddy
dear
i
beg
you
no
rachel
i
ca
well
you
might
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
she
would
be
angry
then
suddenly
she
smiled
shrugged
her
shoulders
at
last
moved
across
and
touched
the
violets
then
with
a
little
gesture
bent
down
and
kissed
him
well
my
dear
of
course
you
will
have
your
way
but
am
i
to
be
allowed
to
come
or
are
these
mysterious
friends
of
yours
too
private
too
secret
not
a
bit
of
it
i
want
you
to
come
i
go
and
take
my
things
off
i
hope
they
come
soon
i
dying
for
tea
i
had
such
a
tiring
day
and
last
night
how
was
last
night
you
have
had
time
to
tell
me
she
was
by
the
door
but
she
turned
and
faced
him
oh
i
was
so
silly
the
weather
upset
me
and
i
went
and
fainted
at
lady
carloes
fainted
his
voice
was
instantly
sharp
with
anxiety
yes
in
the
middle
of
dinner
a
scene
and
uncle
richard
thought
i
let
down
the
family
dreadfully
i
hope
you
went
straight
to
bed
ah
that
was
why
you
saw
christopher
this
morning
yes
that
was
why
no
i
did
come
straight
back
last
night
i
went
round
to
lizzie
i
was
frightened
and
felt
that
i
could
come
back
all
alone
they
were
both
of
them
instantly
aware
that
someone
else
lived
at
saxton
square
beside
miss
rand
there
was
a
sharp
little
pause
during
which
they
both
of
them
heard
their
hearts
say
oh
i
hope
you
going
to
let
little
thing
matter
then
roddy
said
well
dear
i
jolly
glad
you
go
to
lizzie
i
hate
your
fainting
like
that
what
did
christopher
say
this
morning
oh
nothing
i
tell
you
later
she
was
gone
when
she
returned
peters
was
bringing
in
the
tea
and
they
could
exchange
no
word
the
spring
was
beginning
already
the
evenings
were
longer
and
a
pale
glow
lingered
in
the
sky
and
lit
the
green
of
the
park
with
dim
radiance
within
the
room
the
fire
crackled
the
silver
shone
the
lustre
bowl
was
glowing
rachel
went
across
to
the
table
then
staring
out
at
the
evening
light
said
roddy
who
your
visitors
peters
answered
her
question
by
opening
the
door
and
announcing
breton
my
lady
iii
she
took
it
with
a
composure
that
was
simply
panic
frozen
into
stillness
she
saw
him
come
straight
from
the
square
immobility
of
peters
out
to
meet
her
noticed
that
he
looked
most
horribly
ill
and
that
his
eyes
cowered
as
it
were
behind
their
lashes
as
though
they
feared
a
blow
she
saw
him
catch
the
picture
of
her
hold
her
for
an
instant
whilst
his
cheeks
flooded
with
colour
then
all
expression
left
him
he
walked
towards
her
as
though
the
real
francis
breton
after
that
first
glance
had
turned
and
left
the
room
and
only
the
lifeless
husk
of
him
remained
for
herself
after
the
word
from
peters
her
mind
had
flown
to
roddy
he
knew
everything
there
could
no
longer
be
doubt
of
that
but
oh
how
she
turned
furiously
now
upon
the
indecision
that
had
allowed
to
surrender
her
courage
and
her
with
that
she
wondered
what
it
was
that
her
grandmother
had
told
him
perhaps
he
believed
worse
than
the
truth
perhaps
he
thought
that
nothing
too
bad
and
what
after
all
did
he
intend
to
do
this
meeting
had
sprung
from
some
arranged
plan
and
he
had
doubtless
now
some
end
in
view
had
he
meditated
some
vengeance
upon
breton
at
all
costs
he
must
be
protected
meanwhile
breton
had
apparently
taken
it
for
granted
that
she
had
known
about
his
coming
how
do
you
do
lady
seddon
he
said
shaking
her
hand
you
do
know
my
husband
she
said
quietly
roddy
this
is
mr
breton
breton
went
over
to
the
sofa
and
the
two
men
shook
hands
how
do
you
do
roddy
said
smiling
my
word
the
feller
look
ill
was
roddy
thought
he
did
not
know
what
type
of
man
he
had
expected
to
see
but
it
was
not
most
certainly
this
nervous
rather
pathetic
figure
with
the
pointed
beard
the
white
cheeks
the
blue
eyes
the
armless
sleeve
that
uncertain
movement
that
invited
your
consideration
and
seemed
to
say
i
had
a
bad
time
not
altogether
my
fault
i
trying
now
to
do
my
best
do
help
me
just
the
sort
of
feller
women
would
be
sorry
for
roddy
thought
but
he
was
rather
happily
conscious
that
although
he
was
lying
there
helpless
on
his
back
he
was
on
the
whole
in
better
trim
than
his
visitor
breton
before
he
sat
down
turning
to
roddy
said
i
was
very
nearly
wiring
to
you
my
excuses
sir
roderick
i
been
most
awfully
unwell
lately
and
all
that
thunder
yesterday
laid
me
up
i
got
sunstroke
once
in
africa
and
i
always
had
to
be
careful
since
jolly
good
of
you
to
come
said
roddy
sorry
it
was
such
short
notice
but
i
can
never
tell
you
know
quite
how
i
be
from
day
to
day
breton
sat
down
and
the
two
men
looked
at
one
another
to
breton
whose
imagination
led
him
to
live
in
an
alternation
of
consternation
and
anticipation
the
whole
affair
was
utterly
bewildering
he
had
reached
his
rooms
on
the
night
before
soaked
to
the
skin
and
had
found
roddy
note
waiting
for
him
it
had
seemed
to
him
then
as
though
it
were
in
all
probability
some
trick
of
the
devil
but
he
had
of
course
accepted
it
as
he
accepted
all
challenges
he
had
supposed
that
he
would
be
confronted
by
a
raging
tempestuous
husband
he
would
welcome
anything
that
would
bring
him
again
into
contact
with
rachel
and
he
always
enjoyed
a
scene
but
he
had
never
for
an
instant
imagined
that
rachel
would
be
present
the
sight
of
her
took
all
calmer
deliberation
away
from
him
because
he
wished
so
eagerly
to
speak
to
her
and
to
hear
her
voice
they
were
sitting
with
the
table
between
them
and
they
were
both
of
them
conscious
first
of
roddy
lying
so
still
and
watching
them
from
his
sofa
and
then
of
the
last
time
that
they
had
met
and
of
that
last
kiss
they
had
taken
but
rachel
with
strange
relief
and
also
with
yet
stranger
disappointment
was
realizing
that
breton
presence
gave
her
no
spark
no
tiniest
flame
of
passion
she
was
sorry
for
him
she
wished
most
urgently
that
no
harm
should
come
to
him
she
would
here
at
this
moment
protect
him
with
her
life
with
her
honour
with
anything
that
he
might
demand
of
her
but
her
emotion
every
vital
burning
part
of
it
was
given
to
her
retention
of
roddy
she
might
have
felt
anger
because
she
had
as
it
were
been
entrapped
she
might
have
felt
terror
of
the
possible
results
to
herself
she
felt
nothing
except
that
she
must
not
lose
roddy
i
know
now
she
said
perhaps
to
herself
i
know
at
last
what
it
is
that
i
have
wanted
and
knowing
this
if
just
grasping
it
i
should
lose
it
tea
breton
sugar
milk
would
you
take
my
husband
cup
to
him
thank
you
so
much
yes
he
has
sugar
i
was
so
sorry
breton
said
to
hear
of
your
accident
you
must
have
had
a
bad
time
yes
said
roddy
laughing
it
was
rotten
but
what
one
loses
one
way
one
gains
in
another
i
find
people
are
much
pleasanter
than
they
used
to
be
roddy
as
he
looked
at
them
both
had
something
of
the
feeling
that
a
schoolboy
might
be
expected
to
have
did
he
suddenly
find
that
some
trick
that
he
had
planned
was
having
a
really
great
success
he
was
strangely
relieved
at
breton
appearance
he
was
more
sure
than
ever
of
his
retention
of
rachel
he
had
most
delightfully
up
his
sleeve
the
imminent
appearance
of
the
duchess
as
he
looked
at
his
wife
he
could
see
that
she
was
appealing
to
him
not
to
make
it
too
hard
for
both
of
them
he
could
now
that
he
had
seen
breton
flatter
himself
with
something
of
the
same
superiority
that
rachel
had
once
shown
on
beholding
nita
raseley
breton
as
the
moments
passed
felt
firmer
ground
beneath
his
feet
rachel
wondering
how
she
could
contrive
their
meeting
had
chosen
this
the
boldest
way
had
begged
her
husband
to
invite
him
planned
to
make
him
a
friend
of
the
house
and
yet
with
all
this
new
confidence
he
felt
too
that
there
was
something
that
he
missed
in
rachel
some
response
to
his
thrill
he
could
see
that
she
was
ill
at
ease
and
was
relying
on
him
perhaps
to
carry
it
off
so
he
carried
it
off
talked
and
laughed
about
his
experiences
the
countries
that
he
had
seen
things
that
he
had
done
and
as
always
when
he
was
striving
to
make
the
best
impression
made
the
worst
letting
that
note
of
exaggeration
of
something
theatrical
that
was
dangerously
near
to
a
pose
creep
into
his
voice
and
his
attitude
rachel
and
roddy
said
very
little
he
stopped
felt
that
he
had
been
speaking
too
much
and
sensitive
always
to
an
atmosphere
that
was
not
kindly
to
him
cursed
himself
for
a
fool
and
wished
that
he
had
never
spoken
at
all
there
was
a
little
pause
then
roddy
said
that
very
interesting
i
never
been
to
south
america
but
i
hear
it
going
to
be
place
soon
everyone
as
rich
as
croesus
out
there
i
believe
another
cup
rachel
dear
please
oh
thank
you
mr
breton
breton
brought
the
cup
to
rachel
and
then
stood
there
with
his
back
to
roddy
his
eyes
upon
rachel
face
trying
to
tell
her
what
he
was
feeling
quietly
roddy
voice
came
to
them
both
there
one
little
thing
one
reason
why
i
wanted
you
to
come
this
afternoon
mr
breton
rachel
got
up
her
eyes
fixed
intently
upon
roddy
face
no
rachel
do
go
it
concerns
us
all
three
roddy
laughed
i
do
want
any
of
us
to
take
it
very
seriously
it
is
entirely
between
ourselves
i
do
hope
he
went
on
more
gravely
that
i
have
been
takin
any
liberty
in
arrangin
things
like
this
but
it
seemed
to
me
the
only
way
just
to
stop
you
know
the
thing
once
and
for
all
breton
had
left
the
table
and
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
thousand
wild
thoughts
had
come
to
him
this
was
a
trap
a
trap
that
rachel
the
room
whirled
about
him
he
put
his
hand
on
to
the
back
of
a
chair
to
steady
himself
then
turned
to
rachel
seeking
her
with
his
eyes
he
saw
instantly
in
her
white
face
and
eyes
that
never
left
for
an
instant
her
husband
that
there
was
nothing
here
of
which
she
had
had
any
foreknowledge
it
only
said
roddy
that
somebody
came
to
me
a
few
days
ago
and
told
me
that
you
breton
and
my
wife
were
on
friendlier
terms
than
i
well
than
i
would
if
i
had
known
have
cared
for
breton
started
forward
i
he
began
no
please
said
roddy
it
is
anythin
that
i
myself
have
taken
do
you
know
for
a
second
seriously
i
have
only
arranged
that
we
three
should
come
like
this
because
for
all
our
sakes
if
people
are
sayin
those
things
it
ought
to
be
stopped
it
hard
for
me
you
see
bein
like
this
to
know
quite
to
stop
it
so
i
thought
we
just
meet
and
talk
it
over
roddy
drew
a
deep
breath
he
hated
explaining
things
he
disliked
intensely
having
to
say
much
about
anything
he
looked
round
at
rachel
with
a
reassuring
smile
to
tell
her
that
she
need
not
really
be
alarmed
she
had
left
the
table
and
stood
facing
both
the
men
full
at
her
heart
was
a
deep
glad
relief
that
at
last
at
last
the
moment
had
come
when
she
could
tell
everything
when
she
might
face
roddy
with
all
concealment
cleared
when
she
might
above
all
meet
her
definite
challenge
and
withstand
it
but
indeed
she
was
to
meet
it
more
immediately
and
more
dramatically
than
she
had
expected
even
as
she
prepared
to
speak
she
caught
beyond
the
door
strange
shuffling
sounds
the
door
rather
clumsily
as
though
handled
with
muffled
fingers
slowly
opened
framed
in
it
leaning
partly
upon
peters
and
partly
upon
a
footman
staring
at
the
room
and
its
occupants
from
beneath
the
sinister
covering
of
a
black
bonnet
was
the
duchess
the
old
lady
caught
for
a
second
the
vision
of
her
grandchildren
beat
down
from
her
face
the
effect
that
their
presence
had
upon
her
then
moved
slowly
between
her
supporters
towards
the
nearest
chair
chapter
viii
a
quartette
her
dignity
consisted
i
do
believe
in
her
recognition
always
sure
and
prompt
of
the
dramatic
moment
henry
galleon
i
rachel
came
forward
roddy
from
his
sofa
said
something
she
was
it
seemed
unconscious
of
them
all
fixing
her
eyes
upon
a
large
settling
slowly
down
into
it
dismissing
peters
and
the
footman
with
thank
you
that
is
very
kind
then
at
last
leaning
her
hands
upon
her
ebony
cane
raised
her
eyes
and
smiled
grimly
almost
triumphantly
at
roddy
he
had
been
aware
at
that
first
glimpse
of
her
in
the
doorway
that
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
he
should
not
have
done
it
she
was
older
feebler
more
of
a
victim
than
he
had
ever
conceived
her
possibly
to
be
and
in
some
way
the
situation
that
awaited
her
changed
her
entirely
from
the
old
tyrant
who
had
sat
there
talking
to
him
only
a
week
ago
into
someone
who
demanded
of
one
chivalry
of
one
courtesy
protection
roddy
had
also
caught
the
light
of
fierce
recognition
that
had
leapt
up
into
breton
face
as
he
had
realized
who
it
was
that
stood
before
him
breton
must
have
many
old
scores
to
pay
roddy
was
suddenly
frightened
of
the
emotions
the
fierce
resentments
the
angry
rebellions
that
he
had
brought
so
lightly
into
collision
but
the
smile
that
the
duchess
flung
to
him
had
in
it
no
fear
it
said
to
him
oh
young
man
is
your
little
plot
is
it
oh
roddy
my
friend
young
you
are
and
little
you
know
me
if
you
think
that
i
am
in
the
least
embarrassed
by
this
little
gathering
i
glad
that
you
given
me
a
chance
of
showing
what
i
can
do
she
dominated
the
room
she
was
from
the
minute
of
her
appearance
mistress
of
the
situation
they
realized
her
power
as
they
had
never
realized
it
before
sitting
there
leaning
forward
upon
her
cane
she
remarkably
resembled
yale
ross
portrait
she
was
even
wearing
the
green
jade
pendant
and
her
black
dress
her
bonnet
her
fine
white
wrists
a
gold
chain
with
its
jangling
cluster
of
things
a
gold
pencil
a
card
case
a
netted
purse
these
flung
into
fine
relief
the
sharp
white
face
lit
now
with
an
amused
an
ironic
vitality
she
was
old
she
was
ill
she
was
being
trodden
down
by
generations
hungrier
than
any
that
she
had
ever
known
but
she
was
as
indomitable
as
she
had
ever
been
she
looked
about
the
room
her
glance
passed
without
any
flash
of
recognition
without
sign
or
signal
that
she
had
realized
his
presence
over
the
fierce
figure
of
her
grandson
well
my
dear
she
said
to
rachel
i
sure
this
is
all
very
pleasant
and
most
unexpected
let
have
some
tea
i
afraid
said
rachel
that
it
been
standing
some
time
let
me
ring
for
some
fresh
no
i
like
it
strong
it
used
always
to
be
strong
when
i
was
younger
this
new
generation
likes
things
weak
i
believe
rachel
looking
at
her
grandmother
felt
nothing
of
roddy
compunction
she
did
not
even
now
grasp
entirely
roddy
intention
she
had
no
sure
conviction
of
the
climax
that
he
intended
but
she
know
that
here
at
last
was
her
chance
she
should
lift
once
and
for
all
out
from
all
the
lies
and
confusion
that
had
shrouded
them
her
attempts
at
courage
and
honesty
attempts
that
had
wretchedly
most
forlornly
failed
breton
should
know
roddy
should
know
the
duchess
should
know
and
she
herself
should
never
again
go
back
breton
did
not
move
from
the
corner
where
he
was
sitting
he
waited
there
his
hand
pressing
hard
upon
his
knee
roddy
said
most
awfully
good
of
you
duchess
to
come
out
again
i
would
have
dared
to
ask
you
to
come
if
christopher
had
said
that
last
time
did
you
no
harm
only
for
you
roddy
she
answered
him
almost
gaily
and
rachel
of
course
a
nice
day
all
that
thunder
has
cleared
the
air
what
her
voice
must
have
seemed
to
francis
breton
coming
back
to
him
again
after
so
vast
a
distance
bringing
to
him
a
thousand
memories
scenes
and
faces
that
had
been
buried
a
whole
world
of
regrets
and
disappointments
rachel
gave
her
her
tea
brought
a
little
table
to
her
side
thank
you
my
dear
how
you
rachel
you
not
looking
very
well
richard
who
came
in
to
see
me
this
morning
told
me
that
you
were
ill
at
dinner
last
night
he
seemed
quite
anxious
it
was
nothing
thank
you
grandmamma
that
thunder
always
upsets
me
i
was
sorry
to
interfere
with
lady
carloes
not
much
of
a
party
from
what
richard
told
me
and
she
had
in
a
harpist
afterwards
why
a
harpist
poor
aggie
carloes
always
done
the
wrong
thing
ever
since
she
was
a
child
yes
her
little
so
stuffy
they
tell
me
must
have
been
intolerable
last
night
it
was
for
all
three
of
them
a
quite
unbearable
situation
roddy
had
never
even
when
he
was
a
boy
of
sixteen
been
afraid
of
her
now
at
last
he
understood
what
the
power
was
that
had
kept
her
family
at
her
feet
for
so
many
years
indeed
he
seemed
now
to
perceive
in
all
of
them
in
breton
in
rachel
as
well
as
in
the
duchess
a
strain
of
some
almost
hysterical
passion
that
held
in
check
though
it
was
for
the
moment
promised
to
flare
into
the
frankest
melodrama
at
the
slightest
pretext
anything
better
than
this
pause
he
plunged
you
wo
forgive
me
duchess
he
said
abruptly
i
believe
i
done
a
pretty
rotten
thing
i
did
intend
it
that
way
i
only
meant
just
to
clear
everything
up
and
make
it
all
straight
for
everybody
but
if
been
unpardonable
just
say
so
and
give
it
me
hot
he
paused
and
cleared
his
throat
i
wonder
if
you
mind
rachel
said
the
duchess
passing
me
that
little
stool
that
i
see
over
there
that
little
brown
stool
just
put
it
under
my
feet
will
you
thank
you
roddy
desperately
proceeded
it
only
this
you
said
the
last
time
you
came
that
you
had
heard
that
you
knew
that
you
were
afraid
that
rachel
and
your
grandson
breton
were
had
been
seein
too
much
of
one
another
you
just
put
it
to
me
you
know
well
he
went
on
trying
to
make
his
voice
cheerful
and
ordinary
and
failing
completely
lyin
on
one
back
one
gets
thinkin
and
broodin
specially
a
feller
who
has
been
used
to
it
like
me
i
got
worried
not
because
i
did
trust
rachel
and
breton
of
course
all
the
way
because
i
do
but
simply
that
you
know
it
rotten
for
a
feller
to
be
lyin
helpless
on
his
back
thinkin
that
people
are
talkin
about
his
wife
you
know
how
malicious
people
are
duchess
and
i
thought
it
jolly
well
must
be
stopped
you
know
and
i
wanted
it
stopped
quick
and
straight
and
clean
and
i
did
see
how
it
was
goin
to
be
stopped
unless
i
got
us
all
friendly
together
here
and
just
squashed
it
all
of
us
and
so
well
to
speak
well
here
we
are
and
he
concluded
trying
to
smile
upon
everyone
present
i
do
hope
it
all
right
it
did
seem
then
a
poor
sort
of
thing
to
do
but
somehow
gettin
you
all
here
as
a
surprise
he
broke
off
made
noises
in
his
throat
and
felt
that
the
room
was
of
a
burning
heat
he
remembered
vaguely
that
he
had
designed
this
meeting
as
a
punishment
to
the
old
lady
he
had
only
succeeded
however
in
revealing
his
own
cowardice
the
first
glimpse
of
her
had
made
a
poor
creature
of
him
oh
how
he
wished
himself
now
well
out
of
it
and
yet
behind
that
thought
was
the
knowledge
of
the
little
speech
that
he
was
soon
to
make
and
the
way
that
with
it
he
would
win
rachel
and
hold
her
for
ever
after
all
it
came
to
that
absolutely
rachel
was
the
only
thing
in
all
the
world
that
mattered
the
duchess
flung
upon
him
a
kindly
satiric
glance
then
turning
from
him
bent
her
sharp
little
eyes
upon
rachel
leaning
forward
upon
her
cane
so
that
it
appeared
that
it
was
now
only
with
rachel
that
she
had
any
concern
had
i
known
that
my
few
careless
words
she
broke
off
with
a
little
impatient
gesture
ah
rachel
my
dear
i
truly
sorry
my
stupidity
but
rachel
her
eyes
upon
roddy
had
got
up
had
moved
across
to
sofa
and
stood
there
above
him
her
eyes
moved
then
slowly
to
her
grandmother
there
was
no
need
she
said
her
voice
low
and
trembling
for
this
if
i
done
as
i
should
it
could
have
happened
i
responsible
for
all
of
it
and
only
roddy
got
you
here
on
false
pretences
grandmamma
if
you
rather
go
now
thank
you
the
duchess
said
i
much
rather
stay
it
amuses
me
to
see
you
all
together
here
then
said
rachel
i
say
what
i
ought
to
have
said
before
roddy
turning
passionately
round
to
him
you
shall
have
everything
everything
from
the
very
beginning
breton
francis
will
agree
that
that
what
we
should
have
done
long
ago
breton
made
a
movement
as
though
he
would
rise
then
stayed
are
we
my
dear
rachel
said
the
duchess
making
a
great
deal
of
a
very
small
affair
but
rachel
speaking
only
to
roddy
sinking
her
voice
and
bending
a
little
down
to
him
began
roddy
one
thing
you
got
to
know
been
from
the
beginning
only
myself
that
was
to
blame
francis
she
paused
for
an
instant
over
the
name
francis
please
as
he
moved
again
from
his
corner
let
tell
roddy
she
went
on
then
more
firmly
turning
a
little
round
to
her
grandmother
again
roddy
i
do
want
to
defend
myself
it
the
very
last
thing
i
can
try
to
do
i
only
want
to
tell
you
all
three
of
you
exactly
the
truth
you
know
roddy
that
when
i
said
i
marry
you
it
was
a
question
of
love
between
us
at
all
we
had
that
out
quite
straight
from
the
beginning
i
was
awfully
young
i
wanted
safety
and
protection
and
so
i
took
you
you
rather
wanted
me
and
grandmother
wanted
you
to
marry
me
and
so
there
you
were
too
then
i
met
my
cousin
i
heard
about
him
since
i
been
a
baby
and
he
heard
about
me
we
had
a
lot
in
common
tastes
and
dislikes
all
kinds
of
things
we
met
and
he
stirred
in
me
all
those
things
that
you
roddy
had
never
touched
i
had
found
marriage
was
the
freedom
i
had
thought
that
it
would
be
i
was
fond
of
you
you
were
fond
of
me
but
there
was
something
always
there
jogging
both
of
us
just
putting
us
out
of
patience
with
one
another
things
got
worse
you
never
could
explain
what
you
felt
i
tried
but
the
whole
trouble
would
go
into
words
somehow
francis
and
i
wrote
to
one
another
a
little
and
then
one
day
as
grandmamma
has
so
kindly
told
you
here
her
voice
was
sharp
for
a
moment
i
went
to
his
rooms
rachel
stopped
she
was
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
her
hands
clenched
she
seemed
to
dive
deep
for
courage
to
remain
for
an
instant
struggling
then
to
rise
with
it
in
her
hands
her
voice
was
strong
and
unfaltering
we
found
that
we
loved
one
another
we
told
each
other
it
seemed
to
francis
then
that
the
only
thing
was
for
us
to
go
away
together
but
i
refused
odd
though
it
may
seem
roddy
i
cared
for
you
then
more
than
i
ever
cared
for
you
before
and
i
think
it
gone
on
since
then
getting
stronger
always
i
would
go
and
i
would
see
francis
again
and
we
were
to
write
again
unless
i
found
that
our
living
together
roddy
you
and
i
was
hopeless
then
i
said
i
go
to
him
her
voice
sank
and
faltered
there
did
come
a
day
when
i
thought
that
we
could
get
on
any
longer
you
know
what
finally
lizzie
rand
found
out
she
knew
that
i
intended
to
go
away
with
francis
she
fought
to
prevent
it
she
was
splendid
about
it
splendid
we
quarrelled
and
in
the
middle
of
it
came
your
accident
i
wrote
afterwards
to
francis
and
told
him
that
it
was
all
over
absolutely
for
ever
since
then
only
once
she
broke
off
recovered
since
then
there
been
nothing
no
letter
no
meeting
nothing
my
whole
life
now
is
wrapped
up
in
you
roddy
and
francis
knows
that
i
told
you
the
whole
truth
she
turned
from
him
fiercely
round
to
her
grandmother
i
do
know
what
told
roddy
what
you
made
him
believe
wanted
always
to
harm
me
with
roddy
if
you
could
at
least
now
you
ca
tell
him
more
than
i
done
the
duchess
stared
first
at
rachel
then
at
roddy
she
had
behaved
from
the
beginning
as
though
breton
did
not
exist
some
of
her
amiability
had
left
her
her
lips
were
tightly
drawn
together
as
she
listened
and
her
rings
tapped
one
against
the
other
this
is
all
rather
tiresome
she
said
sharply
very
like
you
rachel
to
do
these
things
in
public
you
get
that
from
your
mother
but
strangely
lacking
in
humour
it
all
comes
from
my
own
very
unfortunate
remark
the
other
day
not
like
you
roddy
dear
to
arrange
this
kind
of
thing
stupid
distinctly
i
sure
now
however
that
satisfied
rachel
certainly
been
very
frank
and
now
perhaps
we
might
leave
it
it
was
then
that
francis
breton
came
forward
into
the
middle
of
the
room
his
face
grey
with
anger
something
suddenly
unrestrained
and
savage
in
his
eyes
so
that
the
room
was
filled
with
a
wind
of
angry
agitation
he
stood
in
front
of
his
grandmother
but
turned
his
head
sharply
now
and
again
round
to
roddy
so
agitated
was
he
that
his
words
came
in
little
gasps
flung
out
in
little
bundles
together
and
strangely
accented
as
though
he
were
speaking
in
a
language
that
was
strange
to
him
the
sarcastic
smile
came
back
into
the
old
lady
eyes
and
she
leaned
forward
on
her
stick
again
looking
up
into
his
eyes
i
did
know
i
did
know
that
we
were
going
to
meet
like
this
you
did
know
either
or
you
would
have
come
but
i
been
waiting
for
years
for
this
it
been
nice
for
me
has
it
to
sit
by
whilst
you
done
everything
to
make
things
wretched
for
me
to
ruin
me
to
push
me
back
to
where
roddy
voice
interrupted
breton
i
think
you
forget
instantly
breton
stopped
he
forced
control
upon
his
voice
he
stammered
i
ashamed
i
ought
to
have
but
sitting
there
not
being
allowed
to
speak
you
must
excuse
me
he
turned
round
to
roddy
you
must
think
me
the
most
complete
blackguard
it
only
a
climax
to
everything
that
happened
since
i
came
back
i
do
want
to
defend
myself
but
it
is
it
is
all
so
simple
as
just
talking
about
it
makes
it
look
you
the
kind
of
man
to
whom
everything
just
black
or
white
you
do
it
or
you
do
but
i
i
never
found
that
i
been
in
things
without
knowing
i
been
in
them
i
done
things
that
would
have
turned
out
straight
for
any
other
fellow
but
they
always
been
crooked
for
me
something
always
blinds
me
just
when
i
need
to
see
straightest
that
no
excuse
but
it
an
awful
handicap
i
wo
hide
or
pretend
about
it
why
should
i
i
loved
rachel
only
met
so
little
really
only
that
once
in
my
rooms
that
you
grudge
us
that
we
had
things
heaps
of
things
in
common
long
before
we
knew
one
another
it
was
like
any
ordinary
two
people
meeting
and
i
knew
so
well
that
she
could
make
all
the
difference
to
my
life
that
i
took
the
chance
of
knowing
her
even
though
she
was
ever
going
to
belong
to
me
i
do
think
i
ever
really
believed
that
i
be
the
man
i
know
now
that
she
yours
altogether
and
you
ought
to
have
her
now
that
i
seen
you
i
know
that
and
last
night
when
i
faced
the
fact
that
i
have
to
go
all
my
life
without
her
i
realized
what
she
told
me
long
ago
that
it
was
much
better
just
to
have
my
idea
of
her
and
not
to
have
had
my
regret
about
having
spoiled
anything
for
her
i
no
confidence
in
myself
you
see
if
i
thought
i
were
the
kind
of
man
just
to
carry
her
off
and
make
her
happy
for
ever
and
ever
then
i
suppose
i
have
been
bolder
about
her
long
ago
but
i
know
even
if
she
belong
to
you
at
all
that
i
should
be
afraid
that
i
spoil
her
life
just
as
i
always
spoiled
my
own
i
expect
this
is
all
very
confused
it
all
so
difficult
and
you
want
long
explanations
but
i
only
trying
to
say
that
you
need
ever
have
any
fear
again
that
i
going
to
step
in
or
try
to
have
any
part
in
her
we
got
our
things
together
that
nobody
can
take
from
us
seen
each
other
so
little
that
most
people
would
say
it
was
much
to
give
up
but
things
do
happen
only
when
you
together
he
stopped
suddenly
seemed
to
stand
there
confused
turned
and
flung
a
fierce
defiant
look
at
his
grandmother
exactly
the
glance
that
an
angry
small
boy
flings
at
someone
in
authority
who
has
seen
fit
to
punish
him
then
went
back
to
his
corner
and
stood
there
in
the
shadow
watching
them
all
even
as
he
finished
speaking
he
had
realized
finally
that
his
relationship
with
rachel
was
over
closed
done
for
he
had
known
it
on
that
afternoon
in
the
park
he
had
realized
it
perhaps
again
in
the
heart
of
the
storm
last
night
but
now
when
he
had
seen
the
soul
pierce
through
rachel
eyes
to
her
husband
he
knew
that
roddy
one
way
or
another
had
at
last
won
her
moreover
to
anyone
as
impressionable
as
breton
roddy
helplessness
his
humour
his
bravery
had
on
the
score
of
roddy
alone
settled
the
matter
breton
had
his
fierce
moments
his
high
inspirations
his
noble
resolves
now
as
he
looked
this
last
time
upon
rachel
his
was
no
mean
spirit
rachel
drew
a
sharp
breath
and
looked
at
roddy
with
wide
eyes
flooded
with
fear
he
had
heard
now
everything
that
they
had
to
say
although
she
had
watched
him
so
closely
she
could
not
say
what
he
would
do
as
she
saw
the
two
men
there
before
her
she
felt
that
she
knew
francis
breton
exactly
that
she
could
tell
what
he
would
say
how
he
would
see
things
what
would
anger
him
or
surprise
him
but
about
roddy
she
was
always
uncertain
she
was
only
now
very
slowly
beginning
to
know
him
but
she
was
sure
that
if
roddy
were
to
beat
her
she
would
care
for
him
the
more
but
if
francis
breton
were
to
beat
her
she
would
leave
him
for
ever
a
flush
meanwhile
was
rising
over
roddy
neck
up
into
his
face
to
the
very
roots
of
his
hair
it
rather
beastly
he
said
speaking
very
slowly
and
trying
to
choose
his
words
all
this
talkin
i
might
have
known
if
i
been
able
to
think
about
it
what
it
would
be
like
but
there
i
never
did
i
had
a
kind
of
idea
that
we
all
get
it
over
sort
of
in
five
minutes
and
then
have
tea
do
you
know
and
all
go
away
comfortably
i
do
feel
now
that
you
rightly
got
all
that
everybody
thinks
about
it
it
was
very
decent
of
you
breton
to
say
exactly
so
plainly
you
know
how
you
felt
but
i
do
want
to
talk
a
lot
i
ca
you
know
anyhow
it
only
this
i
wanted
the
duchess
to
hear
me
say
amongst
ourselves
that
i
know
about
it
that
we
know
all
about
it
and
that
there
is
anything
for
anyone
to
talk
about
because
there
anything
in
it
and
if
i
hear
of
anyone
sayin
a
word
they
just
got
to
reckon
with
me
rachel
and
i
know
one
another
and
breton
i
hope
you
go
on
bein
a
friend
of
ours
and
come
and
see
us
often
of
course
you
and
rachel
have
a
lot
in
common
and
it
only
natural
you
should
have
now
duchess
you
can
just
tell
anyone
who
talkin
that
breton
is
welcome
here
just
as
often
as
he
pleases
and
he
a
friend
of
mine
and
my
wife
and
they
can
jolly
well
shut
their
mouths
thank
god
all
over
ii
but
he
was
very
swiftly
to
realize
that
it
was
all
over
sharply
quivering
through
the
air
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
came
the
words
good
god
roddy
are
you
completely
insane
she
was
twisted
distorted
with
anger
she
seemed
to
take
her
rage
and
fling
it
about
her
so
that
the
chairs
the
tables
roddy
innocent
little
sporting
sketches
and
even
the
case
of
birds
eggs
were
saturated
with
it
the
gleaming
park
the
peaceful
evening
sky
the
sharp
curve
of
an
moon
these
things
were
blotted
out
and
the
noises
of
the
town
deadened
by
this
indignant
fury
rachel
had
known
it
in
other
days
to
breton
it
evoked
nursery
hours
to
roddy
it
was
something
utterly
new
and
unsuspected
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
caught
a
shadow
of
the
terror
that
had
darkened
rachel
young
days
to
the
duchess
it
was
simply
that
she
now
clearly
discovered
that
she
was
the
victim
of
an
elaborate
plot
the
three
of
them
oh
she
saw
it
all
and
roddy
roddy
who
had
been
the
one
living
soul
to
whom
her
hard
independence
had
made
concession
this
came
the
definite
climax
to
the
year
accumulations
the
final
decision
flung
at
her
before
she
died
by
those
two
rachel
and
breton
from
whom
of
all
living
souls
she
could
endure
it
least
with
her
rage
rose
her
fighting
spirit
she
would
show
them
these
young
fools
the
kind
of
woman
that
an
earlier
and
a
finer
generation
than
theirs
could
produce
they
had
more
there
before
them
than
one
old
woman
sick
and
ailing
and
they
should
see
it
her
voice
shook
a
little
but
she
gave
no
other
sign
after
that
first
challenge
her
little
eyes
flamed
from
the
mask
of
her
face
like
candles
behind
holes
in
a
screen
this
is
your
sense
of
fun
roddy
i
suppose
she
said
you
always
lacking
in
that
i
told
you
so
before
as
you
asked
me
here
i
suppose
you
ready
for
my
opinion
you
shall
have
it
i
only
ask
you
to
cast
your
eye
over
any
friend
of
ours
see
what
you
would
say
if
this
this
idiotic
folly
committed
by
someone
else
had
come
to
your
ears
i
suppose
you
arranged
this
the
three
of
you
well
you
shall
know
what
i
think
your
tenderness
to
rachel
is
magnificent
she
has
obviously
reckoned
on
it
knew
that
her
frankness
would
serve
her
well
enough
you
already
been
more
patient
with
her
than
men
would
have
been
in
my
day
i
only
hope
that
your
patience
may
not
be
too
severely
tried
as
for
my
grandson
to
whom
you
have
so
tenderly
entrusted
rachel
your
acquaintance
with
him
is
quite
recent
is
it
not
i
am
sure
that
if
you
were
to
enquire
of
any
man
at
one
of
your
clubs
he
would
give
you
quite
excellent
reasons
for
my
grandson
long
unhappy
absence
from
his
relations
and
his
country
at
any
rate
you
do
know
him
as
well
as
i
do
i
could
tell
you
if
you
asked
me
that
it
is
a
long
time
now
since
any
decent
man
or
woman
has
sought
his
society
do
you
suppose
that
his
family
have
not
the
best
of
reasons
for
trying
to
forget
his
existence
an
attempt
that
he
makes
unpleasantly
difficult
have
you
heard
roddy
do
you
really
want
a
man
who
has
been
kicked
out
of
society
for
the
most
excellent
reasons
who
has
disgraced
his
name
as
no
member
of
his
family
has
ever
disgraced
it
before
him
for
your
wife
lover
if
she
must
have
one
rachel
trembling
had
come
forward
roddy
had
cried
out
but
quietly
stronger
than
either
of
them
breton
had
faced
her
she
had
not
throughout
the
afternoon
looked
at
him
nor
spoken
one
word
to
him
now
her
anger
carrying
her
beyond
all
physical
control
she
was
compelled
to
meet
his
gaze
he
stood
very
quietly
beside
her
chair
looking
at
the
three
of
them
my
grandmother
is
wrong
he
said
i
am
not
quite
as
deserted
as
she
thinks
just
before
i
came
here
this
afternoon
uncle
john
called
upon
me
i
had
half
an
hour
very
pleasant
talk
with
him
he
told
me
that
although
his
mother
had
not
altered
her
opinion
of
me
uncle
vincent
and
aunt
adela
and
himself
considered
that
i
had
earned
he
smiled
a
little
forgiveness
he
hoped
that
i
would
understand
that
while
my
grandmother
was
alive
i
could
not
be
invited
to
portland
place
but
that
he
thought
that
i
would
like
to
know
that
they
had
realized
my
well
improvement
and
that
he
hoped
that
we
would
be
friends
i
said
that
i
should
be
delighted
the
duchess
spoke
to
him
then
her
voice
shaking
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
catch
her
words
john
came
said
that
to
yes
it
was
a
curious
coincidence
that
her
eyes
had
dropped
she
murmured
to
herself
john
john
adela
behind
my
back
adela
vincent
they
were
all
silent
she
sat
there
her
head
down
leaning
on
her
hands
brooding
her
anger
seemed
to
have
departed
her
fire
her
fury
had
fled
she
was
a
very
old
woman
and
the
room
was
suddenly
chilly
before
her
were
rachel
and
breton
they
faced
the
ancient
enemy
but
as
rachel
stood
there
realizing
that
there
had
flashed
between
them
the
climax
of
all
their
lives
together
yes
and
a
climax
of
forces
greater
and
more
powerful
than
anything
that
their
own
small
histories
could
contain
she
had
no
sense
of
drama
nor
of
revenge
nor
of
any
triumphant
victory
a
little
while
before
she
had
been
almost
insane
with
anger
now
something
had
occurred
rachel
only
knew
that
the
three
of
them
roddy
francis
and
herself
were
young
and
immensely
vigorous
with
all
life
before
them
but
that
one
day
they
would
be
old
as
this
old
woman
and
would
be
deserted
and
sick
and
past
anyone
need
of
them
oh
i
wish
we
had
i
wish
we
had
she
thought
in
that
moment
silence
they
all
might
have
heard
the
sound
of
the
soft
sharp
click
the
click
that
marked
the
supreme
moment
of
their
relationship
to
the
situation
that
had
for
all
of
them
been
so
long
developing
breton
surrendered
rachel
roddy
received
her
and
beyond
them
all
the
duchess
definitely
abandoned
her
world
for
them
all
grouped
there
so
closely
together
the
heart
of
their
relations
the
one
to
the
other
had
been
revealed
to
them
other
dramas
other
comedies
other
tragedies
this
had
claimed
its
moment
and
had
passed
after
the
silence
the
duchess
said
my
family
i
no
longer
she
stopped
collected
with
all
her
will
her
words
then
in
a
low
voice
said
looking
at
breton
i
owe
you
i
suppose
an
apology
i
owe
that
perhaps
to
you
all
my
children
are
wiser
in
their
own
generation
i
no
longer
understand
the
way
things
go
all
too
confused
for
my
poor
intelligence
she
pulled
herself
together
as
an
old
ship
rights
itself
after
a
roller
stinging
blow
this
has
lasted
long
enough
all
talked
my
family
are
wiser
it
seems
but
she
could
not
go
on
please
roddy
she
said
at
length
i
think
it
time
if
you
ring
i
sorry
he
said
and
then
stopped
soon
peters
and
a
footman
appeared
she
leaned
heavily
upon
them
and
staring
before
her
at
the
door
slowly
went
out
chapter
ix
rachel
and
roddy
tell
me
praise
and
tell
me
love
what
you
both
are
thinking
of
o
we
think
said
love
said
praise
now
of
children
and
their
ways
william
brighty
rand
i
breton
had
gone
the
room
was
empty
rachel
came
and
kneeling
on
the
floor
hid
her
face
in
roddy
coat
he
put
his
hands
about
hers
his
only
desire
now
was
that
there
should
be
peaceful
silence
his
hatred
for
scenes
had
always
been
with
him
an
instinct
natural
alert
untiring
so
that
he
would
undertake
many
labours
forgo
many
pleasant
prizes
if
only
emotional
crises
might
be
avoided
this
afternoon
had
showered
upon
him
a
relentless
succession
of
reverberating
displays
he
had
perceived
one
human
being
after
another
reveal
quite
nakedly
their
tumultuous
feelings
it
was
for
him
precisely
as
though
the
duchess
rachel
breton
had
stripped
there
before
him
and
expected
him
to
display
no
astonishment
at
their
so
doing
that
he
should
have
been
the
author
of
the
business
made
it
no
better
he
reflected
that
he
had
even
looked
forward
with
excitement
to
the
affair
if
i
had
only
known
how
beastly
he
was
ashamed
ashamed
of
his
own
action
in
provoking
these
things
ashamed
of
his
own
lack
of
understanding
ashamed
to
have
watched
the
sharpened
tempers
of
his
friends
he
would
never
heaven
help
him
take
part
in
any
such
scene
again
but
out
of
it
all
one
good
thing
had
come
he
had
got
rachel
as
she
had
looked
across
the
room
meeting
his
eyes
he
had
known
that
at
last
his
long
pursuit
of
her
was
at
an
end
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
most
husbands
after
such
a
declaration
as
rachel
had
just
made
would
have
stormed
reproached
ridden
for
a
long
time
to
come
the
high
horse
of
conscious
superior
virtue
it
did
not
seem
odd
to
him
that
at
the
very
moment
of
confession
he
should
feel
more
sure
of
her
than
he
had
ever
been
before
at
last
the
nita
raseley
debt
was
paid
off
at
last
he
knew
beyond
question
that
rachel
loved
him
best
of
all
perhaps
he
had
seen
breton
and
felt
his
own
superiority
that
being
so
he
wanted
no
words
about
the
matter
he
would
like
to
lie
there
on
his
sofa
with
her
hands
enclosed
in
his
and
nothing
said
between
either
of
them
very
pleasant
and
quiet
there
in
the
dusk
he
hoped
that
he
would
never
again
have
to
explain
anything
or
speak
to
anyone
about
his
feelings
no
not
even
to
rachel
then
he
discovered
that
she
was
sobbing
as
she
knelt
there
and
his
face
crimsoned
with
confusion
and
alarm
rachel
the
proudest
woman
he
had
ever
known
kneeling
to
him
crying
he
tried
to
lift
her
pressing
her
hands
rachel
dear
rachel
her
words
came
between
her
sobs
i
should
have
told
you
long
ago
i
tried
to
i
did
indeed
but
it
was
because
i
was
frightened
because
i
oh
roddy
you
never
trust
me
again
he
was
burning
hot
with
the
confusion
of
it
he
was
almost
angry
both
with
himself
and
her
please
rachel
please
do
it
all
over
dear
nothing
the
matter
it
fine
of
you
to
take
it
like
that
but
you
never
forgive
me
really
you
ca
it
is
possible
this
very
afternoon
i
was
going
to
tell
you
if
all
this
had
happened
you
be
different
now
you
must
be
just
when
i
want
you
so
much
he
glanced
in
despair
about
the
room
he
looked
at
the
sporting
prints
and
the
case
of
birds
eggs
and
at
last
at
rachel
photograph
how
proud
and
splendid
she
was
there
this
dreadful
abasement
he
stroked
her
hair
see
here
old
girl
we
had
a
rotten
afternoon
have
we
awfully
rotten
never
remember
to
have
spent
a
worse
all
my
fault
too
poor
old
duchess
but
look
here
it
all
right
now
i
understand
everythin
and
and
dash
it
all
do
stop
cryin
rachel
old
girl
it
been
bad
enough
she
said
her
voice
steadier
now
the
way
i
been
to
you
all
this
time
but
i
thought
at
least
i
was
honest
i
tried
i
made
a
miserable
failure
but
roddy
you
need
never
never
be
afraid
of
anything
again
i
yours
altogether
roddy
to
do
anything
with
all
about
francis
i
was
mad
somehow
it
was
grandmamma
feeling
she
had
driven
me
into
marrying
you
and
then
nita
and
then
i
know
you
a
bit
all
there
was
in
you
but
now
and
she
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
and
strength
he
bent
down
his
head
and
rather
clumsily
kissed
her
you
know
rachel
i
was
a
bit
frightened
myself
this
afternoon
thought
you
might
be
angry
because
i
took
you
by
surprise
you
bet
if
i
known
what
it
was
going
to
be
like
well
thank
the
lord
it
done
and
we
never
have
another
like
it
i
see
to
that
scenes
are
rotten
things
are
they
i
always
loathed
even
when
i
was
tiny
so
did
the
governor
if
he
had
me
up
for
lickin
all
he
ever
said
was
with
your
bags
that
was
all
there
was
about
it
she
leant
her
cheek
against
his
you
forgiven
me
all
everything
absolutely
she
asked
there
is
any
forgiveness
in
it
he
answered
it
all
the
other
way
if
it
anythin
you
see
i
been
thinkin
a
lot
while
i
was
lyin
here
when
there
was
that
business
over
nita
i
said
you
should
always
be
free
just
as
i
told
you
i
ought
to
be
well
since
since
i
got
that
old
tumble
i
have
any
right
to
hold
you
at
all
i
just
an
old
log
here
no
good
anyway
and
only
a
nuisance
and
if
i
thought
i
was
keepin
you
tied
i
be
miserable
you
see
i
know
you
fond
of
me
now
i
got
that
do
let
talk
any
more
about
it
you
got
me
and
i
got
you
and
we
are
afraid
of
any
old
woman
in
the
world
he
held
her
closely
to
him
his
arms
strong
about
her
there
something
else
to
tell
you
something
else
yes
we
going
to
have
a
child
you
and
i
roddy
and
now
that
forgiven
me
it
all
right
but
that
partly
what
made
me
afraid
all
these
last
weeks
as
it
is
you
got
me
got
me
got
me
safe
for
ever
and
ever
well
i
damned
said
roddy
she
could
feel
his
hand
trembling
upon
hers
oh
she
whispered
i
was
frightened
this
afternoon
terrified
i
thought
you
never
see
me
again
roddy
was
turning
things
over
in
his
mind
a
kid
my
word
just
the
thing
a
boy
it
be
jolly
for
the
place
and
i
can
teach
him
a
lot
it
be
somethin
to
go
back
to
the
house
for
gosh
there
news
his
eyes
wandered
round
the
room
good
thing
i
kept
all
those
eggs
nearly
broke
up
too
they
a
jolly
fine
collection
i
have
prized
like
anything
if
they
come
to
me
when
i
was
small
he
caught
her
hand
so
fiercely
that
she
gave
a
little
cry
what
a
day
we
have
to
see
about
the
shootin
down
at
seddon
again
old
girl
lord
what
an
afternoon
chapter
x
lizzie
becomes
miss
rand
again
so
she
put
the
handkerchief
and
the
pin
and
the
lock
of
hair
back
into
the
box
turned
the
key
and
went
resolutely
about
her
everyday
duties
mrs
ewing
i
lizzie
was
waiting
for
lady
adela
she
had
finished
her
work
for
the
day
had
come
from
her
own
room
to
lady
adela
and
now
stood
at
one
of
the
high
windows
looking
down
upon
the
april
sunshine
that
coloured
the
dignities
of
portland
place
the
room
was
spacious
and
lofty
but
curiously
uncomfortable
and
lifeless
high
with
glass
shutters
revealed
rows
of
cornhill
and
blackwood
volumes
a
long
rather
low
table
covered
with
a
green
cloth
held
a
silver
inkstand
a
pens
and
a
calendar
there
were
stiff
mahogany
chairs
ranged
against
the
wall
and
old
prints
of
beaminster
house
spacious
with
sloping
lawns
and
eton
college
chapel
faced
the
windows
this
was
where
lady
adela
spent
several
hours
of
every
morning
and
she
had
never
attempted
to
do
anything
with
it
a
large
marble
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
ticked
out
its
sublime
indifference
to
time
and
change
we
the
same
thank
god
it
said
as
we
always
been
lady
adela
had
told
lizzie
that
she
would
come
in
from
a
drive
at
quarter
to
four
and
she
would
like
then
to
speak
to
her
lizzie
eyes
were
fixed
upon
portland
place
deserted
for
the
moment
and
catching
in
its
shining
surface
some
hint
of
the
blue
sky
above
it
there
was
a
great
deal
just
then
to
occupy
her
thoughts
ten
days
ago
in
the
middle
of
a
little
that
lady
adela
was
giving
upstairs
the
duchess
had
had
a
stroke
lizzie
had
of
course
not
been
there
but
coming
next
morning
she
had
been
told
of
it
her
grace
was
soon
well
again
no
unhappy
effects
could
be
discovered
she
had
not
herself
been
apparently
disturbed
by
it
but
it
had
rung
like
a
warning
bell
through
the
house
the
beginning
of
the
end
been
watching
we
been
waiting
soon
these
walls
will
be
ours
again
said
the
portraits
of
those
stiff
and
superior
beaminsters
news
ran
through
the
beaminster
camp
the
duchess
has
had
a
stroke
the
duchess
has
had
a
stroke
but
for
many
weeks
now
lizzie
had
been
aware
that
some
crisis
had
found
its
hour
rachel
and
her
husband
lady
adela
and
lord
john
even
the
duke
and
lord
richard
had
been
involved
it
was
not
her
business
to
ask
questions
but
every
morning
that
saw
her
sitting
down
to
her
work
saw
her
also
wondering
whether
it
would
be
her
last
in
that
house
lady
adela
however
sharply
she
may
have
changed
in
herself
had
never
permitted
her
relationship
to
lizzie
to
be
drawn
any
closer
when
lizzie
had
returned
from
that
terrible
christmas
at
seddon
lady
adela
had
asked
her
no
questions
had
shown
no
sign
of
human
anxiety
or
tenderness
she
had
never
during
all
the
years
that
lizzie
had
been
with
her
expressed
gratitude
or
satisfaction
she
had
on
the
other
hand
never
bullied
nor
lost
her
temper
with
her
she
had
separated
herself
from
all
expression
or
human
emotion
and
yet
lizzie
liked
her
she
would
miss
her
when
their
association
ended
yes
she
would
miss
her
and
the
house
and
the
whole
beaminster
interest
when
the
end
came
she
wondered
as
she
stood
at
the
window
whether
that
old
woman
upstairs
were
suffering
what
her
struggle
against
extinction
was
costing
her
how
urgently
she
was
protesting
against
the
passing
of
time
and
the
death
of
her
generation
flying
galleons
of
silver
clouds
caught
the
sun
and
portland
place
passed
into
shadow
the
bell
of
the
round
church
began
to
ring
poor
old
thing
thought
lizzie
she
would
not
have
considered
her
thus
a
year
ago
lady
adela
came
in
she
reminded
lizzie
of
noah
in
her
stiff
wooden
hat
her
stiff
wooden
clothes
her
anxiety
to
prevent
any
mobility
that
might
give
her
away
she
looked
as
she
always
did
carefully
about
the
room
at
the
cornhills
and
blackwoods
at
the
marble
clock
at
the
prints
of
beaminster
house
and
eton
college
chapel
a
little
as
though
she
would
ascertain
that
no
enemy
no
robber
no
brigand
no
outlaw
was
concealed
about
the
premises
a
little
as
though
she
would
say
well
these
things
are
all
right
anyway
nothing
wrong
here
i
sorry
miss
rand
she
said
i
hope
that
i
have
kept
you
no
thank
you
lady
adela
i
have
only
just
finished
lady
adela
sat
down
they
discussed
correspondence
trivial
things
that
were
lizzie
knew
placed
as
a
barrier
against
something
that
frightened
her
at
length
it
came
miss
rand
i
wonder
whether
the
fact
is
my
mother
has
just
decided
that
she
wishes
to
be
moved
to
beaminster
house
i
must
of
course
go
with
her
i
hope
that
this
will
not
inconvenience
you
you
can
if
you
prefer
not
to
leave
your
mother
come
down
every
day
by
train
it
only
takes
an
hour
just
as
you
please
lizzie
heart
was
strangely
poignantly
stirred
the
moment
had
come
then
the
house
was
to
be
deserted
this
could
only
mean
the
end
she
herself
would
never
return
here
her
little
room
the
large
solemn
house
that
walk
from
saxton
square
the
round
church
the
queen
hall
regent
park
but
she
gave
no
sign
gravely
she
replied
i
think
i
better
come
down
with
you
lady
adela
if
you
do
mind
my
mother
has
my
sister
perhaps
i
might
come
up
for
the
yes
that
would
be
quite
easy
the
other
places
you
know
are
let
but
beaminster
has
always
been
kept
the
duke
has
been
there
a
good
deal
it
reminds
me
i
was
there
for
some
years
as
a
girl
lizzie
realized
that
lady
adela
was
very
near
to
tears
she
had
never
before
seen
her
in
any
way
moved
she
was
distressed
and
uncomfortable
it
was
as
though
lady
adela
were
suddenly
after
all
these
years
about
to
be
driven
from
a
position
that
had
seemed
in
its
day
impregnable
oh
do
please
do
now
was
lizzie
silent
cry
it
will
spoil
it
all
all
these
years
lady
adela
did
her
voice
became
dry
and
hard
her
eyes
without
expression
we
shall
go
down
i
expect
on
monday
if
christopher
thinks
that
a
good
day
i
hope
that
the
duchess
my
mother
very
well
quite
her
old
self
i
have
just
been
up
with
her
it
is
odd
but
for
thirty
years
she
has
never
expressed
any
interest
in
beaminster
now
she
is
impatient
to
be
there
one
often
i
think
has
a
sudden
longing
for
places
yes
i
shall
be
glad
myself
to
be
there
again
this
house
oh
we
shall
shut
it
up
for
the
time
lord
john
will
come
down
to
beaminster
with
us
i
have
spoken
to
norris
but
morning
if
you
do
mind
we
will
go
through
things
certainly
the
house
has
not
been
shut
for
a
great
number
of
years
a
very
great
number
during
the
last
thirty
years
through
the
hottest
weather
my
mother
was
here
it
will
seem
strange
her
voice
trembled
is
there
anything
more
this
afternoon
lizzie
turned
to
the
door
no
i
think
not
except
perhaps
lady
adela
was
in
great
agitation
her
eyes
sought
lizzie
beseeching
her
help
miss
rand
i
think
it
only
right
to
say
i
afraid
one
can
not
in
the
nature
of
things
it
impossible
i
fear
to
expect
my
mother
to
live
very
much
longer
her
voice
caught
in
a
dry
strangled
cough
christopher
has
warned
us
after
my
mother
death
my
life
of
course
will
be
very
different
i
shall
live
very
quietly
a
good
deal
in
the
country
and
abroad
i
expect
i
shall
not
of
course
have
a
secretary
i
quite
understand
said
lizzie
quietly
i
want
you
to
know
miss
rand
lady
adela
continued
that
although
during
all
these
years
i
have
seemed
very
unappreciative
it
is
not
my
way
i
find
it
difficult
to
express
but
i
have
nevertheless
been
very
conscious
we
have
all
been
of
the
things
that
you
have
done
for
me
indeed
for
the
whole
house
you
have
been
admirable
quite
admirable
i
have
been
very
happy
here
said
lizzie
i
am
very
glad
of
that
i
must
have
seemed
often
very
blind
to
all
that
you
were
doing
but
i
should
like
you
to
know
that
it
is
more
it
is
more
than
simply
your
duty
to
the
house
it
is
the
many
things
that
you
have
done
personally
for
me
you
have
not
yourself
been
i
dare
say
aware
of
the
effect
that
your
company
has
had
upon
me
it
has
been
very
great
lizzie
smiled
i
loved
the
house
and
the
work
it
has
meant
a
very
important
part
of
my
life
i
shall
never
forget
it
their
embarrassment
was
terrible
after
a
moment
of
struggle
lady
adela
voice
was
hard
and
unconcerned
again
you
know
miss
rand
that
when
the
time
comes
for
this
change
anything
that
i
or
any
of
us
can
do
i
do
not
know
what
your
own
plans
may
be
but
you
need
have
no
fear
i
think
thank
you
very
much
lady
adela
that
is
very
kind
there
was
a
little
pause
then
they
said
good
night
as
lizzie
went
down
the
great
staircase
on
every
side
of
her
the
stones
of
the
house
were
whispering
you
all
going
you
all
going
you
all
going
her
heart
was
very
sad
ii
as
she
passed
the
regent
street
post
office
francis
breton
came
out
of
it
they
had
not
met
often
lately
but
she
was
conscious
that
ever
since
that
interview
in
regent
park
they
had
been
very
good
friends
her
absorption
with
rachel
and
affairs
in
the
portland
place
house
had
assisted
her
own
resolution
and
she
had
thought
that
she
could
meet
him
now
without
a
tremor
nevertheless
the
tremor
came
as
she
caught
sight
of
him
there
and
for
a
moment
the
traffic
and
the
shouting
died
away
and
there
was
a
great
stillness
he
was
very
glad
to
see
her
he
stood
on
the
post
office
steps
looking
richer
and
smarter
than
she
had
ever
known
him
he
wore
a
dark
blue
suit
and
a
black
tie
and
a
bowler
hat
all
ordinary
garments
enough
but
they
surrounded
him
with
an
air
of
prosperity
that
had
not
been
his
before
he
seemed
to
her
to
gleam
and
glitter
and
shine
with
confidence
and
assurance
one
hurried
glimpse
she
had
had
of
him
some
weeks
before
miserable
unkempt
almost
furtive
she
was
glad
for
his
sake
that
all
was
well
with
him
but
he
needed
her
more
when
he
was
unhappy
but
he
was
delighted
miss
rand
that
splendid
are
you
going
back
to
saxton
square
now
the
very
thing
i
been
wanting
badly
to
see
you
it
was
always
she
thought
in
little
hurried
and
occasional
walks
that
they
exchanged
their
confidences
there
was
not
much
to
show
for
all
the
elaborate
palace
that
she
had
once
been
building
snatches
of
conversation
clutches
at
words
and
movements
even
eloquent
interpretation
of
silences
well
she
was
wiser
than
all
that
now
but
when
they
started
off
together
she
found
that
she
was
caught
up
instantly
into
that
fine
assumption
of
intimacy
that
was
one
of
his
most
alluring
qualities
radiant
though
he
was
he
still
needed
her
he
was
more
eager
to
talk
to
than
to
anyone
else
even
though
he
had
forgotten
her
very
existence
until
he
saw
her
standing
there
i
am
glad
to
see
you
i
should
have
come
down
and
tried
to
find
you
anyway
in
a
day
or
two
i
been
through
a
rotten
time
really
rotten
and
one
does
want
to
see
anyone
even
one
best
friends
in
that
sort
of
condition
does
one
that
just
the
time
your
friends
if
they
worth
anything
want
to
see
you
if
they
can
be
of
any
use
but
you
been
such
a
tremendous
help
to
me
i
was
ashamed
to
come
to
you
any
more
besides
you
showed
me
in
a
way
that
i
ought
to
get
through
on
my
own
without
asking
help
from
anyone
you
taught
me
that
i
did
try
she
saw
that
he
was
shining
with
the
glory
of
one
who
had
come
rather
mightily
unaided
through
times
of
stress
a
pleasant
pathos
stirred
behind
his
words
it
a
bad
time
but
it
all
right
now
and
i
expect
it
was
good
for
me
was
really
what
he
said
i
do
want
to
tell
you
he
went
on
eagerly
about
rachel
it
all
been
so
strange
wonderful
in
a
way
after
that
talk
i
had
with
you
in
the
park
i
was
absolutely
broken
up
oh
but
done
for
i
simply
went
under
i
tried
to
go
back
to
some
of
that
old
set
i
told
you
about
before
but
the
awful
thing
was
that
rachel
would
let
me
thinking
of
her
wanting
her
when
all
those
other
women
were
about
it
simply
possible
it
got
worse
and
worse
i
thought
i
go
off
my
head
then
do
you
remember
that
awful
thunderstorm
we
had
yes
said
lizzie
i
remember
it
very
well
that
night
was
a
kind
of
climax
i
dined
with
christopher
then
got
wandering
about
it
was
horribly
close
and
heavy
got
into
some
music
hall
i
suppose
i
been
drinking
anyway
i
had
suddenly
a
kind
of
vision
there
in
the
music
hall
i
thought
rachel
was
dead
that
lost
her
altogether
and
then
it
all
so
hard
to
explain
but
when
i
came
to
myself
i
seemed
to
understand
that
the
only
way
i
could
keep
her
was
by
giving
her
up
i
got
it
all
muddled
but
that
was
what
it
came
to
you
were
quite
right
said
lizzie
well
then
what
do
you
think
happened
the
very
next
day
my
uncle
john
beaminster
came
to
see
me
yes
came
himself
talked
and
was
most
pleasant
and
wanted
to
be
friends
at
the
same
time
now
just
listen
to
this
came
a
note
from
seddon
asking
me
to
go
and
see
him
i
went
found
rachel
there
apparently
my
delightful
grandmother
had
been
telling
him
stories
about
rachel
and
me
and
he
wanted
to
put
things
straight
as
though
this
were
enough
right
upon
us
without
a
word
of
warning
dropped
my
grandmother
herself
he
stopped
that
he
might
convey
fully
to
lizzie
the
drama
of
the
occasion
there
was
in
his
words
just
that
touch
of
absurdity
and
exaggeration
that
she
had
noticed
at
her
very
first
meeting
with
him
he
was
always
too
passionately
anxious
to
thrill
his
audience
there
a
scene
you
can
imagine
it
we
all
tried
to
behave
at
first
although
of
course
it
was
immensely
difficult
i
do
think
seddon
had
in
the
least
realized
the
kind
of
thing
it
would
be
then
she
the
old
tyrant
could
contain
herself
no
longer
and
burst
out
concerning
me
the
blackguard
i
was
and
the
rest
of
it
she
was
furious
you
see
at
seddon
taking
my
friendship
with
rachel
so
quietly
he
was
about
it
well
when
she
burst
out
about
all
the
family
cutting
me
and
everybody
casting
me
out
the
opportunity
was
too
good
i
help
it
i
had
to
tell
her
that
uncle
john
had
been
round
that
very
afternoon
to
see
me
and
that
the
family
was
holding
out
its
arms
what
happened
said
lizzie
as
he
paused
she
collapsed
altogether
completely
she
never
said
another
word
she
just
went
you
should
have
done
it
lizzie
cried
turning
almost
furiously
upon
him
oh
it
was
cruel
she
was
so
old
and
all
of
you
so
young
and
strong
yes
he
answered
her
but
think
of
the
years
that
i
waited
the
times
she
given
me
the
suffering
no
interrupted
lizzie
quiet
again
now
if
you
weak
enough
to
be
pushed
down
by
anybody
like
that
then
you
weak
enough
to
sink
by
your
own
fault
whether
there
anyone
there
or
no
she
been
hard
in
her
time
i
dare
say
but
everything
left
her
now
and
she
ill
and
lonely
it
was
wrong
of
all
of
you
i
should
have
thought
sir
roderick
he
only
wanted
things
to
be
straightened
out
breton
said
eagerly
he
did
to
have
a
scene
but
i
expect
you
right
miss
rand
as
you
always
are
i
been
a
brute
the
most
howling
cad
but
one
thing
i
do
think
it
hurt
my
grandmother
she
likes
those
scenes
and
she
been
none
the
worse
since
she
been
much
worse
said
lizzie
gravely
she
dying
she
going
down
to
beaminster
on
monday
he
stopped
oh
but
i
sorry
that
dreadful
i
no
idea
always
responsible
he
had
sunk
to
such
depths
that
she
was
compelled
to
raise
him
i
do
think
you
need
be
disturbed
breton
something
of
the
sort
would
have
been
certain
to
happen
very
soon
she
would
have
found
out
in
any
case
and
there
were
other
things
i
know
rachel
ah
he
broke
in
eager
again
and
almost
cheerful
that
was
the
wonderful
thing
when
i
saw
her
there
first
with
seddon
i
never
met
him
before
you
know
i
felt
angry
and
impatient
i
wanted
to
carry
her
off
away
from
everybody
and
then
when
seddon
began
to
speak
i
lost
all
sense
of
rachel
belonging
to
me
she
seemed
older
ever
so
far
away
from
him
and
he
was
so
fine
so
splendid
about
it
all
that
i
felt
i
felt
well
that
i
do
anything
in
the
world
for
both
of
them
but
never
anything
that
could
separate
them
or
make
him
unhappy
you
ca
separate
them
now
said
lizzie
nobody
can
no
it
was
just
finished
our
episode
together
that
was
really
an
episode
at
all
if
you
consider
the
little
that
we
saw
one
another
besides
i
never
got
near
rachel
and
i
felt
in
some
way
that
the
nearer
i
got
to
her
the
farther
away
she
was
why
the
only
time
that
i
kissed
her
she
was
the
farthest
away
of
all
they
were
walking
up
the
grey
peaceful
square
you
do
mind
my
telling
you
all
this
do
you
miss
rand
you
seen
it
all
from
the
beginning
but
i
odd
in
a
way
uncle
john
coming
to
me
seddon
being
friendly
to
me
the
family
taking
me
back
that
seems
to
have
made
all
the
difference
to
me
although
i
never
confess
it
even
to
myself
i
know
that
if
rachel
and
i
had
gone
off
together
i
never
have
been
happy
you
see
we
both
alike
that
way
we
restless
one
half
of
us
but
oh
we
beaminster
the
other
and
even
rachel
who
been
fighting
the
family
all
her
days
has
one
part
of
her
that
happy
to
be
married
to
seddon
and
to
be
quiet
and
proper
and
english
that
why
neither
i
nor
seddon
ever
could
hold
her
because
to
be
with
me
she
have
had
to
give
up
the
other
if
she
had
a
child
that
might
she
going
to
have
a
child
said
lizzie
he
stopped
and
stared
at
her
miss
rand
is
that
certain
quite
ah
well
seddon
got
her
all
right
they
be
happy
as
anything
he
sighed
you
know
miss
rand
rachel
and
i
have
been
fighting
the
old
lady
and
we
seem
to
have
won
but
i
not
sure
whether
after
all
she
has
on
the
step
he
paused
i
sticking
to
candles
i
got
work
i
recognized
again
i
got
that
little
bit
of
rachel
that
she
gave
me
and
that
nobody
else
can
have
and
i
got
you
for
a
friend
not
so
bad
after
all
he
laughed
opened
the
door
for
her
and
then
as
they
stood
in
the
dark
little
hall
he
said
all
along
you
been
a
friend
for
me
i
want
someone
like
you
someone
strong
and
sensible
without
my
rotten
sentiment
and
impulses
we
always
be
friends
wo
we
he
held
her
hand
always
she
said
smiling
at
him
but
perhaps
to
both
of
them
there
came
just
then
sighing
through
the
dark
still
hall
a
breath
a
whisper
of
that
hour
when
life
had
been
at
its
intensest
that
hour
when
breton
had
held
rachel
in
his
arms
that
hour
when
lizzie
had
dressed
with
trembling
hands
for
the
theatre
for
breton
his
place
once
again
in
the
world
for
lizzie
work
and
peace
of
heart
but
once
on
a
day
life
had
flamed
before
both
of
them
and
they
would
never
forget
well
good
night
mr
breton
good
night
miss
rand
when
he
had
gone
she
stood
in
the
hall
a
moment
their
little
dialogue
had
closed
with
the
sound
of
a
closing
door
a
stage
in
her
life
she
would
never
be
the
same
as
she
had
been
before
that
episode
it
had
shown
her
that
she
was
as
romantic
as
the
rest
of
the
world
it
had
made
her
kinder
tenderer
wiser
and
now
once
again
she
was
independent
once
again
her
soul
was
her
own
she
could
be
once
more
his
friend
seeing
him
with
all
his
faults
his
impetuosities
his
weak
impulses
her
place
was
there
for
her
to
fill
it
was
not
the
place
that
she
would
once
have
chosen
but
she
had
regained
her
soul
had
once
more
control
of
her
spirit
she
was
free
there
stretched
before
her
a
world
of
work
of
thrilling
and
interest
there
were
rachel
and
rachel
baby
you
seem
in
very
good
spirits
lizzie
said
rand
as
she
came
in
i
sure
i
very
glad
because
it
too
tiresome
here
daisy
gone
off
iii
afterwards
she
said
to
her
mother
i
going
down
to
beaminster
on
monday
i
afraid
i
shall
be
away
some
time
oh
lizzie
said
rand
reproachfully
well
now
that
a
pity
why
must
you
the
duchess
is
going
and
lady
adela
must
go
with
her
and
i
must
go
with
lady
adela
dear
dear
whatever
shall
we
do
daisy
and
i
daisy
gets
idler
every
day
it
always
clothes
with
her
now
i
suppose
we
shall
manage
i
shall
come
up
for
what
a
way
you
speak
of
it
of
course
you
do
care
if
you
went
away
for
years
you
would
miss
us
i
dare
say
i
ca
think
why
it
is
lizzie
that
you
always
so
hard
daisy
and
i
have
got
plenty
of
feeling
and
emotion
and
your
father
poor
man
had
more
than
he
could
manage
but
i
sure
more
better
than
none
at
all
where
feelings
are
concerned
i
suppose
said
lizzie
speaking
to
more
than
her
mother
that
if
everyone
had
so
much
feeling
there
be
nobody
to
give
the
advice
feelings
do
suit
everybody
you
a
strange
girl
said
rand
and
you
like
no
one
in
our
family
all
your
aunts
and
uncles
are
kind
and
friendly
i
do
suggest
that
you
do
do
your
best
lizzie
you
do
i
sure
and
nobody
could
deny
that
you
got
a
head
for
figures
and
running
a
house
but
a
little
heart
i
come
to
the
conclusion
i
better
without
any
lizzie
laughed
i
expect
i
more
like
you
and
daisy
mother
than
you
know
well
you
a
strange
girl
said
rand
again
and
i
never
understand
half
you
say
lizzie
came
to
her
and
kissed
her
you
always
miss
me
you
know
mother
when
i
away
in
spite
of
my
hard
heart
well
that
true
said
rand
looking
at
her
daughter
with
wide
and
rather
tearful
eyes
but
i
sure
i
do
know
why
i
do
chapter
xi
the
last
view
from
high
windows
not
without
fortitude
i
wait
i
in
this
house
so
rifted
marr
so
ill
to
live
in
hard
to
leave
i
so
that
have
no
joy
in
this
your
day
i
rachel
on
the
morning
of
april
received
this
letter
from
lady
adela
beaminster
house
my
dear
rachel
mother
suddenly
last
night
expressed
an
urgent
wish
to
see
you
she
has
not
been
at
all
well
during
the
last
few
days
and
christopher
who
has
been
here
since
last
saturday
says
that
if
you
can
come
down
and
see
her
he
thinks
that
it
would
be
a
comfort
to
her
she
is
sleeping
very
badly
but
is
wonderfully
tranquil
and
seems
to
like
to
be
here
again
if
you
can
come
down
afternoon
i
will
send
to
meet
the
at
ryston
that
is
quicker
than
going
round
to
munckston
if
i
do
hear
i
conclude
that
you
are
coming
by
that
train
my
love
to
roddy
your
affectionate
aunt
adela
beaminster
rachel
showed
the
letter
to
roddy
i
so
glad
she
said
i
been
hoping
that
she
send
for
me
felt
ever
since
that
day
that
i
should
never
be
easy
again
if
i
had
the
chance
to
tell
her
that
i
see
now
that
i
that
we
were
wrong
she
never
answered
my
letter
said
roddy
perhaps
she
was
well
enough
to
write
yes
i
glad
you
going
rachel
she
was
moved
by
many
emotions
the
old
lady
dying
the
house
in
whose
shadow
she
had
spent
so
many
of
her
timid
angry
adventurous
young
years
the
thrill
that
the
thought
of
her
child
gave
her
now
at
every
vision
of
the
world
the
knowledge
that
in
roddy
she
at
last
had
someone
in
her
life
to
whom
after
every
absence
however
short
she
was
eager
to
return
these
things
shone
with
new
wonderful
lights
around
her
journey
the
april
evenings
were
lengthening
and
the
dusks
were
warm
and
scented
the
little
station
lay
peacefully
in
the
heart
of
green
fields
across
the
sky
washed
clean
of
every
colour
a
dark
train
of
birds
slowly
lazily
took
their
flight
trees
were
dim
with
edges
sharp
against
the
a
dog
barking
in
the
distance
gave
rhythm
to
the
stillness
rachel
driving
through
the
falling
dark
felt
as
she
had
felt
it
when
she
was
a
small
child
the
august
colour
and
space
and
dignity
of
the
first
vision
of
the
great
house
white
as
a
ghost
now
under
the
first
stars
speaking
to
her
with
the
old
voice
fountains
that
splashed
in
gardens
the
river
that
ran
at
the
end
of
the
sloping
lawns
the
chiming
clock
that
rang
out
the
hour
as
she
drove
up
to
the
door
aunt
adela
uncle
john
chris
lizzie
they
were
all
there
and
their
presences
made
less
chill
the
dominating
reason
for
their
assembly
over
all
the
house
the
shadow
fell
the
wide
high
rooms
the
long
picture
gallery
the
comfortless
grandeur
of
a
house
that
had
not
found
for
some
years
many
human
creatures
to
lighten
it
these
echoed
and
flung
forwards
and
backwards
the
note
of
suspense
of
pause
of
impending
crisis
but
rachel
spent
one
of
the
happiest
evenings
of
her
life
with
uncle
john
and
christopher
she
knew
that
uncle
john
had
had
a
short
but
terrible
interview
with
her
grandmother
that
he
had
been
charged
with
treachery
and
dishonour
and
every
traitorous
wickedness
a
week
ago
when
he
had
told
her
this
he
had
been
the
picture
of
despair
and
shame
i
had
meant
her
to
know
she
was
to
come
into
it
at
all
and
then
that
she
should
meet
him
at
roddy
on
that
very
afternoon
there
nothing
bad
enough
for
me
but
he
had
added
with
a
strange
note
of
defiance
so
unlike
the
old
uncle
john
i
had
felt
it
my
duty
rachel
to
speak
to
francis
i
had
felt
it
the
right
thing
to
do
i
had
felt
it
very
strongly
then
he
had
been
overwhelmed
now
he
was
once
more
at
peace
and
tranquil
it
all
right
he
told
rachel
i
been
forgiven
i
think
forgiven
all
of
us
she
would
listen
when
i
wanted
to
tell
her
how
sorry
i
was
she
seems
now
not
to
care
she
never
forgiven
anyone
anything
before
said
rachel
hush
my
dear
i
do
think
you
ought
to
say
that
we
never
understood
her
any
of
us
she
always
been
beyond
us
you
realize
rachel
how
wonderful
how
she
is
but
he
was
very
happy
he
had
his
old
rachel
back
the
old
rachel
whom
he
had
expected
never
to
see
again
she
sat
between
him
and
christopher
at
dinner
no
longer
fierce
and
ironical
with
sudden
silences
and
swift
angers
but
affectionate
sympathetic
happy
mother
will
see
you
adela
told
her
she
glad
that
come
the
morning
rather
a
bad
time
for
her
could
you
stay
for
the
whole
day
of
course
rachel
said
at
the
end
of
the
evening
she
went
up
to
lizzie
room
when
midnight
rang
from
the
tower
they
parted
but
first
rachel
said
lizzie
i
wonder
whether
you
realize
what
you
been
to
all
of
us
to
me
of
course
but
to
the
others
to
the
whole
family
oh
nonsense
roddy
was
speaking
about
it
yesterday
he
said
that
you
were
the
most
wonderful
person
in
all
the
world
for
making
all
the
difference
without
saying
or
doing
anything
by
just
being
there
oh
roddy
thinks
everybody
but
this
is
what
i
coming
to
you
ca
yourself
know
how
much
difference
you
make
to
everyone
but
there
just
this
roddy
feels
and
i
feel
that
when
he
comes
of
course
it
be
a
boy
we
rather
have
you
for
his
friend
than
anyone
in
the
whole
world
you
will
you
will
be
wo
you
my
dear
i
should
so
i
whack
him
and
bath
him
and
snub
him
and
teach
him
his
letters
anything
you
like
then
she
added
rather
gravely
there
one
thing
rachel
i
wanted
to
say
for
some
time
i
want
you
to
know
definitely
that
all
wounds
are
closed
now
healed
about
breton
i
mean
i
was
afraid
that
you
might
think
i
still
cared
that
all
ended
closed
up
that
little
episode
you
need
be
afraid
rachel
i
happier
i
freer
than
i
ever
been
in
my
life
good
night
my
dear
your
friendship
is
more
to
me
than
any
number
of
i
was
always
meant
to
be
independent
you
know
ii
it
was
very
strange
to
rachel
who
had
been
on
so
many
many
evenings
to
that
other
room
to
pause
now
outside
this
new
door
to
knock
with
the
house
solemn
and
still
around
her
to
hear
dorchester
voice
then
with
the
old
hesitation
and
yes
with
some
of
the
old
fear
to
enter
she
had
considered
what
she
would
say
coming
down
in
the
train
she
had
turned
it
over
and
over
her
apology
her
submission
her
cry
see
different
utterly
different
from
the
rachel
whom
you
knew
i
was
a
prig
of
the
very
worst
i
deserved
everything
you
thought
of
me
just
say
you
forgive
me
even
though
you
ca
like
me
this
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
in
the
train
had
seemed
possible
enough
now
with
the
opening
of
the
door
and
that
sharp
recurrence
of
the
old
thrill
she
was
not
at
all
sure
that
she
wanted
to
be
submissive
and
affectionate
i
do
feel
fond
of
her
nothing
could
make
me
there
are
too
many
things
space
and
silence
saluted
rachel
two
great
mirrors
ran
from
floor
to
ceiling
high
windows
flooded
the
room
with
light
and
everything
seemed
to
be
intended
only
for
such
a
situation
as
this
the
very
house
the
grounds
the
colour
of
the
day
had
arranged
themselves
in
their
purity
and
air
and
silence
about
the
central
figure
the
duchess
lay
in
a
long
low
chair
before
the
window
she
was
wrapped
in
white
shawls
and
thick
rugs
covered
her
body
dorchester
the
same
stern
unbending
dorchester
said
gravely
to
rachel
good
afternoon
my
lady
i
hope
that
you
are
well
then
moved
into
another
room
the
duchess
had
not
stirred
at
the
sound
of
the
closing
doors
nor
at
dorchester
voice
nor
at
rachel
approach
she
was
gazing
out
beyond
the
windows
to
the
expanse
of
sunlit
country
fields
that
sloped
towards
the
river
an
orchard
white
with
blossom
running
down
the
hill
its
colour
dazzling
almost
visibly
trembling
against
the
sky
rachel
had
only
seen
her
in
the
portland
place
rooms
with
the
china
dragons
the
gold
ornaments
the
red
lacquer
bed
the
blazing
it
had
seemed
then
that
she
must
have
those
things
around
her
that
she
needed
the
colour
and
extravagance
to
support
her
flaming
passion
for
life
so
curbed
and
shackled
by
disease
their
absence
made
her
older
feebler
more
human
but
also
grander
and
more
impressive
rachel
had
always
feared
her
but
despised
herself
for
her
fear
now
she
was
in
the
presence
of
something
that
made
her
proud
to
be
afraid
she
thought
that
she
might
be
asleep
so
she
moved
very
quietly
a
chair
forward
near
the
window
and
sitting
down
waited
the
only
sound
in
all
the
world
was
the
steady
splash
splash
splash
of
the
fountain
below
the
only
movement
the
stealthy
creeping
of
the
long
shadows
flung
by
white
boulder
clouds
across
the
shining
fields
suddenly
without
turning
her
head
the
duchess
spoke
very
good
of
you
rachel
i
hoped
that
you
would
come
her
voice
was
weak
her
words
indistinct
as
though
she
were
speaking
through
muffled
shawls
but
nevertheless
behind
them
the
presence
of
the
old
dominating
will
was
to
be
discerned
but
now
it
was
a
will
quiescent
struggling
no
longer
for
power
i
would
have
come
before
if
you
had
sent
for
me
i
so
glad
that
you
did
i
ca
talk
for
very
long
my
dear
and
i
do
suppose
that
you
want
to
spend
hours
in
my
company
any
more
than
you
ever
done
no
you
need
protest
we
neither
of
us
here
for
compliments
but
there
something
that
i
must
say
to
you
christopher
allows
me
half
an
hour
i
hope
you
better
that
being
here
has
done
you
good
better
nonsense
i
do
want
to
be
better
that
all
over
and
done
with
i
had
another
stroke
three
days
ago
and
the
next
one
will
finish
me
so
do
pretend
you
used
to
be
honest
enough
i
asked
you
to
come
because
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
roddy
he
wrote
rachel
said
yes
i
got
his
letter
i
could
reply
i
ca
write
myself
and
i
wo
have
anyone
else
do
it
for
me
besides
there
was
nothing
to
write
about
he
said
he
was
sorry
about
that
little
conversation
we
all
had
together
the
other
day
and
i
rachel
began
eagerly
i
was
so
sorry
i
been
longing
to
tell
you
it
was
all
wrong
but
roddy
has
no
imagination
he
realize
in
the
least
ah
my
dear
i
expect
i
know
roddy
a
great
deal
better
than
you
do
he
do
the
same
sort
of
thing
to
you
one
day
he
got
the
devil
in
him
and
will
always
have
it
however
much
you
coddle
him
or
let
him
lie
there
thinking
over
his
sins
do
you
suppose
i
have
been
so
fond
of
roddy
all
these
years
if
i
had
known
him
capable
of
such
little
revenges
i
liked
it
there
was
no
need
to
write
to
me
and
he
knew
it
but
i
afraid
you
influence
him
a
good
deal
rachel
coloured
i
hope
oh
yes
you
do
and
that
exactly
why
i
wanted
to
see
you
she
turned
then
and
very
carefully
very
slowly
her
eyes
searched
rachel
face
i
let
him
marry
you
you
know
i
thought
it
would
be
good
for
you
if
i
guessed
the
effect
that
you
have
had
upon
him
i
have
prevented
it
rachel
anger
was
rising
what
effect
he
begun
to
worry
about
other
people
a
fatal
thing
with
a
man
like
roddy
who
was
meant
to
do
things
not
think
about
them
but
anyway
that
all
too
late
now
waste
of
time
discussing
it
what
i
wanted
you
for
is
this
her
eyes
left
rachel
face
and
returned
to
the
window
you
the
one
person
now
that
influences
him
and
you
will
always
be
so
i
can
see
ahead
well
enough
poor
roddy
and
he
might
have
been
a
fine
man
all
the
same
i
admire
him
for
it
there
are
things
about
you
i
could
have
liked
if
i
wanted
to
find
them
but
we
been
fighting
from
the
beginning
until
now
when
it
the
end
she
caught
her
breath
stayed
for
an
instant
struggling
for
words
then
went
on
we
can
call
a
truce
now
we
do
like
one
another
but
just
at
the
moment
you
moved
a
little
because
i
feeble
and
shall
be
dead
in
a
fortnight
that
disturbs
you
it
need
some
months
ago
a
moment
did
come
when
i
realized
that
i
should
die
soon
i
hated
it
i
fought
and
struggled
with
all
my
might
but
now
that
it
has
come
it
matter
nothing
matters
i
regret
nothing
i
had
my
time
i
hate
the
new
generation
the
manly
woman
and
the
soft
man
with
all
this
sentimental
nonsense
about
caring
for
other
people
think
of
yourself
fight
for
yourself
keep
up
your
pride
that
the
only
way
the
ever
been
run
you
a
sentimentalist
and
you
making
one
of
roddy
nonsense
it
all
is
but
all
this
is
what
i
really
wanted
to
say
she
turned
back
and
her
eyes
as
again
they
held
rachel
were
softer
roddy
been
my
only
weakness
i
loved
that
boy
and
he
far
too
good
and
fine
for
a
wobbler
like
yourself
that
why
i
hated
it
the
other
day
i
could
bear
that
he
should
see
me
beaten
by
the
pair
of
you
both
of
you
thinking
yourself
so
noble
with
your
fine
confessions
not
that
i
believe
a
word
that
you
said
but
it
was
clever
of
you
you
clever
and
know
how
to
manage
men
yes
that
hurt
me
but
afterwards
i
loved
him
all
the
better
i
believe
i
rather
he
had
written
me
that
soppy
letter
but
that
was
your
doing
of
course
but
listen
after
i
gone
i
want
roddy
to
think
of
me
kindly
he
going
to
think
very
much
what
you
make
him
it
in
your
hands
you
when
you
got
past
this
sentimental
moment
will
hate
the
memory
of
me
it
natural
that
you
should
and
i
sure
i
do
mind
but
i
want
you
to
leave
roddy
alone
if
he
likes
to
think
of
me
kindly
let
him
do
blacken
his
mind
to
me
i
wish
to
feel
my
only
weakness
i
do
believe
that
roddy
will
be
fond
of
my
memory
that
rests
with
you
she
stopped
with
a
little
final
movement
of
her
head
as
though
having
said
what
had
been
in
her
mind
for
a
long
while
she
was
finished
absolutely
with
it
all
and
wanted
no
word
more
with
any
human
being
rachel
answered
quietly
you
said
some
rather
hard
things
you
must
feel
that
i
ever
try
to
make
roddy
think
badly
of
you
not
fair
i
not
very
proud
of
myself
but
you
do
understand
me
you
always
been
determined
not
to
and
perhaps
in
the
same
way
not
understood
you
we
different
generations
that
what
it
really
is
but
over
roddy
we
meet
i
did
love
him
when
i
married
him
but
i
do
now
and
we
going
to
have
a
child
that
will
make
us
both
very
happy
i
expect
you
love
roddy
and
i
love
him
you
need
be
afraid
that
i
harm
his
memory
of
you
her
voice
was
trembling
and
she
was
very
near
to
tears
she
would
have
liked
to
have
said
something
that
would
have
offered
some
terms
of
peace
between
them
something
upon
which
afterwards
she
might
look
back
with
comfort
for
her
that
hostility
seemed
in
the
face
of
death
so
small
and
poor
a
thing
but
no
words
would
come
her
grandmother
in
a
voice
that
was
very
weak
said
thank
you
rachel
that
a
great
relief
to
me
that
good
of
you
and
now
my
dear
i
think
christopher
would
say
that
i
talked
enough
good
night
rachel
knew
that
this
was
their
last
meeting
that
here
was
the
absolute
conclusion
of
all
the
years
of
warfare
that
there
had
been
between
them
there
was
nothing
to
say
she
bent
down
and
kissed
the
dry
cheek
waited
for
an
instant
but
there
was
no
movement
good
night
grandmamma
she
said
i
hope
that
you
be
better
then
softly
stole
away
iii
the
duchess
lay
very
still
watching
the
shadows
as
they
crept
across
the
fields
they
were
evening
shadows
now
for
the
sky
pink
like
the
inside
of
a
shell
had
no
clouds
upon
its
surface
she
would
not
get
up
again
this
evening
should
be
the
last
to
see
her
gaze
upon
the
world
it
was
too
fatiguing
and
all
energy
had
flowed
from
her
leaving
her
without
desire
without
passion
without
regret
without
fear
very
dreamily
and
at
a
great
distance
figures
and
scenes
from
her
past
life
hovered
halted
and
passed
but
she
was
not
interested
she
had
forgotten
their
purpose
and
meaning
she
did
not
want
to
think
any
more
the
splashing
of
the
fountain
was
phantasmal
and
very
far
away
the
long
black
shadow
crept
up
the
field
she
watched
it
at
the
top
of
the
red
ridge
of
field
against
the
very
sharp
and
clear
was
a
gate
golden
now
in
the
sun
when
the
shadow
caught
it
she
would
go
to
bed
and
she
would
never
get
up
again
she
waited
lazily
indifferently
the
gate
was
caught
the
last
gleams
of
the
sun
had
left
the
orchard
and
the
evening
star
glittered
in
a
sky
very
faintly
green
she
touched
a
bell
at
her
side
and
dorchester
appeared
i
go
to
bed
dorchester
very
well
your
grace
i
sha
get
up
again
too
much
trouble
she
turned
away
from
the
window
and
closed
her
eyes
chapter
xii
rachel
roddy
lord
john
christopher
came
in
to
dinner
in
the
best
of
spirits
everything
was
discussed
i
the
duchess
of
wrexe
died
on
the
morning
of
may
at
a
three
the
evening
papers
of
that
day
and
the
morning
papers
of
the
next
had
long
columns
concerning
her
and
these
were
picturesque
and
almost
romantic
she
appealed
as
a
figure
veiled
but
significant
hidden
but
the
landmark
of
a
period
nothing
was
more
remarkable
than
the
influence
that
she
exercised
over
english
society
during
the
thirty
years
that
she
was
completely
hidden
from
it
or
again
although
disease
compelled
her
for
thirty
years
to
retire
from
the
world
her
influence
during
that
period
increased
rather
than
diminished
it
must
be
confessed
however
that
london
society
was
not
moved
to
its
foundations
by
the
news
of
her
death
people
said
oh
that
old
woman
gone
at
last
i
see
she
been
dying
for
years
has
she
quite
a
power
in
her
day
or
oh
the
duchess
of
wrexe
is
dead
i
see
i
must
write
to
addie
beaminster
do
expect
the
family
will
miss
her
much
awful
old
tyrant
i
believe
or
i
say
see
johnnie
beaminster
old
lady
gone
she
kept
the
of
in
his
time
damned
glad
he
be
i
bet
two
years
earlier
and
it
would
not
have
been
thus
but
now
there
was
the
war
daily
the
relief
of
mafeking
was
frantically
anticipated
and
fine
regal
majesty
sitting
dignified
in
a
solemn
room
irritated
the
world
by
its
quiescence
what
we
needing
now
is
for
everyone
to
get
a
move
on
no
use
sitting
around
a
few
carefully
selected
american
phrases
can
very
swiftly
kill
a
great
deal
of
dignity
and
tradition
in
the
beaminster
camp
itself
there
was
an
unexpressed
disappointment
they
had
grown
accustomed
to
thinking
of
her
as
a
fine
figure
sitting
there
where
rather
fortunately
they
were
not
compelled
to
visit
her
but
where
nevertheless
she
had
a
grand
effect
they
had
known
for
a
long
time
now
that
she
was
not
so
well
but
they
had
expected
in
a
vague
way
that
she
would
go
on
living
for
ever
they
had
been
making
during
the
last
two
years
a
succession
of
enforced
compromises
and
now
the
crisis
of
her
death
showed
them
how
far
they
had
gone
without
knowing
it
things
will
never
be
the
same
as
they
were
and
in
their
hearts
they
said
we
getting
old
we
are
wanted
as
we
once
were
meanwhile
there
was
a
fine
funeral
down
at
beaminster
the
queen
was
represented
the
prime
minister
the
leader
of
the
opposition
all
the
heads
of
all
the
old
families
in
england
artists
and
one
or
two
very
distinguished
who
looked
far
more
sumptuous
than
anyone
else
present
everyone
was
there
christopher
detected
bronson
and
wondered
what
the
duchess
would
think
of
it
if
she
knew
brun
also
although
christopher
did
not
see
him
flashed
upon
them
from
the
continent
was
present
neat
and
solemn
and
immensely
observant
it
was
all
admirable
and
worthy
of
the
best
english
traditions
she
was
a
fine
figure
said
the
prime
minister
who
had
known
her
and
disliked
her
intensely
we
shall
never
see
her
like
again
but
his
sigh
was
nearer
relief
than
regret
ii
christopher
three
days
after
the
funeral
went
to
have
tea
with
roddy
and
rachel
he
was
a
man
of
great
physical
strength
and
had
never
had
nerves
in
his
life
but
he
was
feeling
just
now
tired
out
he
had
not
realized
in
the
least
during
all
these
years
the
part
that
that
old
woman
played
in
his
life
and
he
found
that
his
whole
scheme
of
things
was
now
disorganized
and
without
vitality
it
was
vitality
that
she
had
given
him
a
tiresome
troublesome
irritating
vitality
perhaps
but
nevertheless
a
fire
an
energy
a
driving
curiosity
he
would
capture
it
again
his
eagerness
to
investigate
to
assist
to
prophesy
but
it
would
never
any
more
be
quite
the
same
energy
everyone
with
whom
she
had
had
anything
to
do
would
find
life
now
a
little
different
some
weeks
before
her
death
roddy
had
sent
for
him
i
awfully
upset
christopher
he
said
and
then
he
had
told
him
about
the
scene
in
his
rooms
and
had
begged
to
know
the
truth
i
hear
she
much
worse
had
a
stroke
i
wrote
to
her
and
she
has
answered
me
christopher
tell
me
truthfully
was
it
her
comin
to
me
that
day
and
all
the
and
everythin
that
made
her
so
much
worse
christopher
had
reassured
him
quite
honestly
if
she
asked
my
leave
to
let
her
go
out
that
afternoon
i
not
have
granted
it
but
as
it
turned
out
she
was
a
bit
the
worse
i
saw
her
directly
afterwards
she
told
me
all
about
it
she
was
rather
grimly
pleased
mind
you
it
marked
i
think
a
kind
of
crisis
as
she
put
it
to
me
she
saw
that
afternoon
that
the
whole
scheme
of
things
had
gone
out
of
her
hands
and
that
the
new
generation
did
want
her
but
i
think
she
was
glad
to
have
it
settled
for
her
she
was
tired
of
it
all
her
struggle
to
keep
it
had
been
much
earlier
she
just
was
going
to
bother
any
more
and
she
might
have
gone
on
in
that
sort
of
way
for
years
but
although
he
had
thus
reassured
roddy
he
was
not
in
his
heart
so
certain
he
seemed
to
see
a
long
chain
of
events
he
dated
his
own
observation
of
them
from
the
time
of
rachel
coming
out
that
had
led
both
rachel
and
the
duchess
to
the
climax
of
their
actual
challenge
one
to
another
it
was
not
that
that
meeting
in
roddy
house
had
been
of
itself
so
important
it
was
rather
that
the
fates
had
selected
it
as
a
definite
culmination
of
the
struggle
that
meeting
stood
for
a
sharp
visualization
of
much
more
than
the
personal
conflict
she
had
been
glad
to
go
he
did
not
in
any
way
see
her
death
as
a
tragedy
but
her
departure
had
marked
the
opening
of
a
new
period
a
new
personal
history
for
the
remaining
characters
ultimately
perhaps
a
new
social
epoch
for
everybody
meanwhile
he
was
happy
about
roddy
and
rachel
for
the
first
time
since
their
marriage
and
as
he
was
a
man
who
lived
in
the
lives
of
his
friends
their
happiness
meant
his
own
he
found
lord
john
with
roddy
rachel
was
with
aunt
adela
but
would
be
back
for
tea
lord
john
rather
solemn
and
awkward
in
black
clothes
was
demanding
comfort
and
assistance
from
his
friends
his
trouble
was
that
he
did
not
miss
his
mother
as
fundamentally
as
he
desired
and
that
at
the
same
time
life
was
now
most
terribly
different
his
brothers
vincent
and
richard
had
instantly
after
the
funeral
adapted
themselves
with
gravity
and
assurance
to
the
new
conditions
lord
john
had
never
adapted
himself
to
anything
but
had
fitted
his
stout
body
into
the
soft
places
that
life
had
offered
to
him
and
had
been
placidly
grateful
for
their
softness
only
once
had
he
shown
energy
of
his
own
initiative
and
that
had
been
in
the
matter
of
his
nephew
francis
and
of
that
now
he
did
not
dare
to
think
he
could
never
so
long
as
he
lived
forget
the
slightest
detail
of
that
horrible
quarter
of
an
hour
with
his
mother
when
she
discovered
his
iniquity
and
yet
even
now
he
felt
obscurely
but
obstinately
that
he
had
done
right
nevertheless
he
would
never
again
take
life
into
his
own
hands
upon
that
he
was
absolutely
resolved
what
he
needed
now
was
reassurance
from
his
friends
he
had
always
before
found
that
life
arranged
itself
about
him
in
a
comfortable
way
and
he
confidently
expected
that
it
would
do
so
now
but
meanwhile
he
must
have
kind
looks
and
words
from
somebody
he
was
a
man
who
hailed
with
joy
the
opportunity
of
bestowing
affection
upon
a
friend
who
was
not
likely
at
a
later
time
to
rebuff
him
he
had
never
been
quite
sure
of
rachel
she
was
so
strange
and
uncertain
but
upon
roddy
helpless
and
a
man
of
his
own
world
he
felt
that
he
could
rely
he
spent
therefore
many
hours
at
roddy
side
rather
silent
smiling
a
great
deal
playing
chess
with
him
sticking
little
flags
on
the
war
map
at
times
as
he
sat
there
he
would
think
of
his
mother
of
the
portland
place
house
shortly
to
be
sold
of
a
world
altered
and
alarming
and
then
he
would
wonder
how
long
the
time
would
be
before
he
might
again
take
up
his
old
habits
his
old
houses
his
old
comforts
and
then
his
fat
cheerful
face
would
gather
wrinkles
upon
its
surface
it
after
a
thing
like
this
that
a
feller
gets
old
richard
and
adela
and
i
have
to
make
up
our
minds
to
it
christopher
found
them
busied
with
the
map
discussing
the
probable
hour
of
mafeking
relief
lord
john
looked
at
christopher
a
little
anxiously
perhaps
was
going
to
be
down
upon
but
christopher
was
a
very
quiet
and
genial
christopher
he
sank
down
into
a
chair
with
a
sigh
of
comfort
waved
his
hand
to
them
do
you
mind
me
i
tired
to
death
was
up
all
last
night
with
a
case
you
see
said
roddy
there
ramathlabama
well
plumer
lost
a
lot
men
there
and
they
say
his
crowd
have
had
fever
too
and
there
ai
much
to
hope
for
there
now
roberts
but
lord
john
attention
was
distracted
he
wished
to
be
quite
sure
that
christopher
did
not
regard
him
with
severity
you
look
fagged
out
christopher
i
am
said
christopher
smiling
i
feeling
a
bit
done
up
too
think
i
take
adela
abroad
somewhere
for
a
little
i
should
said
christopher
excellent
thing
for
both
of
you
now
where
do
you
suggest
oh
anywhere
different
from
london
go
on
a
cruise
adela
a
bad
sailor
wretched
i
not
very
good
myself
they
discussed
places
christopher
was
more
than
friendly
there
had
been
occasions
when
he
had
been
the
stern
family
physician
and
had
treated
lord
john
with
some
severity
now
there
was
implied
a
new
comradeship
as
though
they
had
passed
through
perils
together
and
would
have
always
between
them
in
the
future
a
strong
bond
of
friendship
john
felt
that
the
atmosphere
at
this
moment
was
so
friendly
and
comforting
that
he
would
not
risk
the
disturbance
of
it
he
got
up
think
i
be
going
on
roddy
do
like
leaving
adela
alone
rachel
will
be
on
her
way
here
now
so
i
be
getting
back
he
was
staying
with
adela
at
a
quiet
little
hotel
in
dover
street
well
for
the
moment
christopher
adela
be
very
glad
if
you
come
in
and
see
her
come
and
have
lunch
with
us
thanks
i
will
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
out
upon
the
park
warm
and
comfortable
under
the
sun
he
thought
of
rachel
he
had
regained
the
old
rachel
the
other
night
at
beaminster
dear
rachel
rachel
roddy
christopher
how
nice
they
all
were
there
was
he
felt
a
new
feeling
of
security
amongst
them
all
yes
he
really
believe
that
life
now
was
going
to
be
very
comfortable
and
safe
and
easy
so
long
roddy
he
beamed
happily
upon
them
and
went
jacob
the
dog
came
in
from
his
afternoon
walk
very
grave
paying
no
attention
to
christopher
but
going
at
once
and
lying
full
length
near
roddy
sofa
his
head
between
his
paws
his
eyes
fixed
upon
his
master
what
happened
to
all
your
other
dogs
asked
christopher
they
must
be
missing
you
very
badly
oh
they
down
at
seddon
got
a
jolly
good
man
there
whom
i
can
trust
do
think
they
miss
me
beggar
would
though
funny
thing
christopher
when
i
was
goin
about
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
thought
nothin
of
this
dog
could
see
why
rachel
made
such
a
fuss
of
it
now
why
i
do
know
how
i
ever
get
on
without
it
so
understandin
and
quiet
with
it
all
too
nothin
like
a
trouble
of
some
sort
for
showin
who
worth
what
whether
they
dogs
or
people
i
hope
the
funeral
did
rachel
no
harm
christopher
said
not
a
bit
of
it
she
had
a
last
interview
with
the
old
lady
and
knew
after
that
she
never
see
her
again
in
a
way
she
has
felt
it
but
in
a
way
too
i
believe
she
like
to
have
all
the
old
time
over
again
and
see
whether
she
could
manage
it
better
she
said
to
me
never
understood
the
old
woman
until
that
last
talk
with
her
not
that
there
was
much
love
lost
between
even
then
was
breton
there
no
he
scarcely
could
go
in
the
circumstances
funny
feller
breton
what
puzzles
me
is
what
did
he
go
and
give
up
rachel
so
easily
for
i
could
tell
you
why
but
that
day
he
came
here
i
was
as
sure
as
i
was
lyin
here
that
whatever
there
was
between
them
was
finished
i
would
have
said
what
i
did
seemed
to
take
it
so
quietly
if
i
had
seen
in
a
minute
it
was
all
over
ah
you
do
know
francis
said
christopher
it
all
romantic
impulses
that
set
him
going
rachel
romantic
impulse
on
one
side
getting
back
to
the
family
romantic
impulse
on
the
other
he
knew
if
he
went
off
with
her
that
getting
back
to
the
family
would
be
over
for
ever
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
knew
that
he
never
cease
to
regret
it
john
beaminster
coming
to
him
gave
him
what
he
been
waiting
for
longing
for
he
seized
it
yes
but
it
was
more
than
that
said
roddy
slowly
it
all
lies
with
rachel
he
never
got
close
to
her
any
more
than
i
done
i
know
now
that
she
fond
of
me
but
it
by
the
child
i
hold
her
and
by
my
helplessness
nothin
else
and
she
have
her
wild
moments
when
myself
and
everythin
about
me
will
seem
simply
impossible
just
as
if
gone
off
with
breton
she
have
had
her
comfortable
domestic
sort
of
longin
and
hated
and
everythin
about
i
believe
breton
knew
just
as
i
knew
that
never
tryin
to
hold
her
was
the
way
to
keep
her
and
he
have
to
have
her
if
he
gone
off
with
her
anyway
rachel
would
be
so
adorable
if
there
was
a
lot
of
her
that
no
one
man
could
master
but
i
been
given
all
the
tricks
in
the
game
by
bein
laid
up
like
this
just
when
i
thought
i
lost
all
worth
havin
in
life
and
never
a
chance
of
a
kid
again
funny
thing
life
but
she
mine
christopher
and
no
one
can
take
her
breton
got
his
idea
of
her
there
a
bit
of
her
that
he
stirred
that
i
never
could
touch
but
it
do
matter
she
the
most
wonderful
creature
on
this
earth
and
i
the
luckiest
beggar
she
be
quieter
said
christopher
now
that
the
duchess
is
gone
they
were
always
conscious
of
one
another
and
now
there
be
the
kid
instead
if
he
a
boy
i
swear
he
shall
be
the
best
rider
the
best
sportsman
in
this
bloomin
old
world
not
that
i
mind
a
girl
either
i
like
to
have
a
girl
just
the
time
for
a
woman
nowadays
whichever
way
it
is
i
be
contented
not
you
know
he
added
hastily
that
i
going
to
be
a
sort
o
blessed
angel
with
domestic
bliss
and
never
wantin
to
get
off
this
old
sofa
and
the
rest
not
a
of
it
it
damned
tryin
and
i
curse
hours
together
often
enough
peters
has
the
benefit
of
it
i
was
born
an
angel
and
i
sha
die
one
nobody
wants
you
to
said
christopher
well
you
need
worry
but
it
funny
how
i
get
nowadays
never
used
to
say
a
word
now
i
gas
away
well
cheers
for
the
new
generation
cheers
for
young
roddy
secundus
long
life
to
him
there
one
thing
said
christopher
looking
at
him
whatever
inspired
you
that
day
you
had
the
scene
here
to
behave
to
frank
breton
as
you
did
to
give
them
both
carte
blanche
it
would
be
the
way
of
most
husbands
confronted
with
such
a
question
it
was
the
way
for
rachel
but
how
did
you
know
her
well
enough
you
forgive
my
saying
so
your
method
as
a
rule
is
to
drive
straight
in
let
fly
all
round
and
then
count
the
bits
if
you
love
anybody
said
roddy
with
confusion
and
hesitation
as
much
as
i
love
rachel
you
become
wonderfully
understandin
look
here
he
broke
off
do
let
talk
any
more
rot
just
drop
all
jaw
about
feelin
and
such
there
been
an
awful
lot
of
it
lately
he
would
say
no
more
they
got
the
war
map
and
very
happily
for
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
moved
flags
up
and
down
its
surface
then
came
rachel
and
after
her
tea
they
were
a
quiet
but
very
happy
company
during
the
next
how
aunt
adela
asked
roddy
very
well
considering
said
rachel
of
course
she
confused
and
lost
her
bearings
rather
she
misses
the
portland
place
house
more
than
anything
i
think
she
was
there
so
long
but
uncle
vincent
was
right
it
would
have
been
very
bad
for
her
if
she
stayed
in
it
quiet
and
depending
a
lot
upon
lizzie
when
tea
was
ended
rachel
said
chris
i
got
something
to
say
to
you
i
going
to
tear
you
away
from
roddy
for
five
minutes
if
come
upstairs
well
that
a
nice
sort
of
thing
protested
roddy
i
wo
keep
him
she
took
him
up
to
the
little
and
as
they
sat
there
by
the
window
together
he
thought
of
that
day
when
he
had
told
her
the
duchess
was
downstairs
with
roddy
they
had
all
travelled
a
long
way
since
then
there
a
favour
i
want
you
to
grant
me
anything
in
the
world
it
about
francis
she
gave
him
the
name
with
a
little
hesitation
and
with
an
air
of
restraint
as
though
about
the
very
whisper
penalties
could
linger
you
the
best
friend
that
he
got
the
best
friend
any
man
could
have
and
i
want
you
to
care
for
him
to
look
after
him
to
watch
over
him
i
know
she
went
on
hurriedly
that
you
always
have
done
that
but
i
want
you
to
feel
now
that
you
doing
it
a
little
for
my
sake
as
well
as
your
own
i
want
you
to
be
the
one
link
that
i
still
got
with
him
but
roddy
asked
him
began
christopher
oh
yes
i
know
roddy
was
splendid
but
of
course
that
ca
be
we
ca
meet
at
any
rate
for
years
besides
that
time
is
so
utterly
done
with
there
only
roddy
now
for
me
in
all
the
world
but
i
know
better
i
expect
than
you
think
how
weak
francis
is
how
much
he
depends
upon
what
the
people
whom
he
cares
for
say
to
him
and
so
i
want
you
but
of
course
christopher
said
he
knows
that
he
can
count
on
me
whatever
happens
he
always
known
that
he
stopped
and
waited
for
her
to
continue
he
saw
that
she
had
more
to
say
it
so
strange
she
said
staring
her
eyes
deep
and
black
seeing
into
sacred
places
that
were
known
only
to
her
how
death
has
cleared
amazingly
the
air
the
motive
for
almost
everything
has
gone
i
did
see
i
had
the
least
idea
how
all
my
thoughts
and
actions
and
wishes
and
impulses
came
from
my
sense
of
opposition
to
her
francis
saw
that
knowing
that
we
both
hated
her
and
that
was
why
i
was
so
difficult
with
roddy
because
i
thought
that
grandmother
had
arranged
the
marriage
and
had
him
under
her
thumb
i
had
no
idea
of
the
kind
of
person
roddy
was
nor
had
i
nor
had
anyone
said
christopher
that
whole
affair
with
francis
was
in
idea
always
more
than
in
fact
i
knew
and
i
believe
that
he
knew
that
it
was
simply
a
piece
of
wild
rebellion
on
my
part
and
on
his
well
he
like
that
romantic
rebellious
responding
in
a
minute
to
everything
but
wanting
really
all
the
time
to
be
safe
and
proper
that
day
we
met
in
his
rooms
we
both
knew
at
heart
that
something
was
missing
something
one
had
to
have
if
one
was
going
to
break
away
altogether
he
was
always
a
rebel
by
force
of
circumstances
never
by
real
inclination
she
put
her
hand
on
christopher
knee
and
drew
very
close
to
him
chris
dear
i
terrified
now
when
i
think
of
how
near
i
was
to
absolute
complete
disaster
if
it
had
been
for
roddy
accident
and
for
lizzie
lizzie
been
to
all
of
us
everything
in
the
world
do
you
remember
once
telling
me
about
brun
tiger
i
often
thought
of
it
since
and
it
seems
to
me
now
that
to
all
of
us
for
roddy
and
francis
and
lizzie
and
me
the
moment
of
our
consciousness
came
ever
since
that
day
when
they
carried
roddy
back
to
seddon
each
one
of
us
has
had
to
wait
just
holding
ourselves
in
but
you
know
chris
that
the
secret
of
the
whole
matter
it
was
i
or
breton
or
even
lizzie
or
roddy
that
defeated
grandmother
it
was
simply
real
life
first
the
war
then
roddy
accident
roddy
accident
most
of
all
we
had
all
five
of
us
been
leading
sham
lives
then
suddenly
god
fate
providence
what
you
will
steps
in
jerks
us
all
back
takes
away
from
all
of
us
what
we
thought
we
wanted
most
puts
us
in
line
with
the
real
thing
our
tiger
if
you
like
grandmother
simply
could
stand
it
lizzie
and
roddy
are
real
half
of
breton
and
me
and
most
of
grandmother
unreal
well
lizzie
and
roddy
have
just
put
things
straight
quietly
grandmother
generation
saw
things
a
glass
darkly
they
gone
it
all
going
to
be
to
face
now
christopher
looked
at
her
smiling
she
was
so
young
so
adorably
young
with
her
seriousness
she
broke
in
what
rot
i
talking
it
only
comes
to
this
that
i
wish
now
like
anything
that
i
been
nicer
to
grandmamma
one
sees
things
always
too
late
i
like
to
have
another
try
to
begin
with
grandmamma
again
to
be
more
tolerant
to
hate
her
less
but
i
expect
in
the
end
it
would
be
the
same
she
have
had
me
tied
up
without
a
will
of
my
own
without
a
word
to
say
that
was
her
idea
of
controlling
us
all
it
over
it
done
with
no
one
i
expect
will
have
her
kind
of
power
again
but
she
was
fine
i
only
see
now
how
fine
she
was
no
one
i
expect
will
have
her
kind
of
power
again
now
she
stood
away
from
christopher
looking
at
him
and
also
beyond
him
as
though
she
were
finally
once
and
for
all
surveying
cataloguing
that
same
power
she
was
terrible
she
was
fine
she
was
really
anything
except
a
kind
of
peg
for
all
sorts
of
traditions
to
hang
on
to
in
herself
she
was
just
a
plucky
theatrical
obstinate
old
woman
it
was
simply
the
idea
of
her
that
frightened
us
all
i
remember
the
first
time
that
i
saw
yale
ross
picture
of
her
he
caught
all
the
ceremony
and
the
terror
it
was
then
that
i
had
the
first
faint
suspicion
that
she
did
in
herself
live
up
to
the
picture
in
the
least
i
suppose
she
went
on
coming
up
closer
to
him
that
that
why
no
one
will
ever
be
like
her
again
because
no
one
will
ever
be
taken
in
so
completely
by
shams
again
never
by
the
empty
shell
of
anything
but
that
just
how
she
influenced
us
all
of
us
myself
you
lizzie
roddy
francis
we
were
all
mixed
up
in
it
and
then
the
first
moment
that
we
really
came
into
contact
with
her
she
was
anything
was
simply
there
do
you
know
chris
seeing
her
now
just
an
old
sick
woman
conscious
that
everyone
was
escaping
her
i
almost
love
her
i
do
indeed
she
sprang
up
and
stood
before
him
and
laughed
crying
i
grown
up
chris
i
grown
up
it
taken
a
time
but
happened
at
last
meanwhile
i
shall
be
the
most
perfect
wife
the
most
perfect
mother
and
when
the
tiger
is
restive
there
be
the
youngest
seddon
to
put
it
all
into
oh
what
a
child
that
child
will
be
roddy
and
his
impatience
me
and
my
tempers
she
laughed
and
for
an
instant
her
old
fierce
defiance
was
there
then
as
though
some
spirit
had
flashed
before
his
eyes
through
the
window
into
space
and
freedom
it
was
gone
she
herself
proclaimed
its
dismissal
it
gone
it
all
gone
chris
i
the
happiest
woman
in
england
but
even
as
she
spoke
her
eyes
were
wistful
eloquent
with
a
colour
a
flame
that
was
too
fierce
for
her
present
world
hung
before
her
the
memory
of
a
moment
when
in
a
darkened
room
she
had
caught
a
letter
to
her
lips
had
sunk
upon
her
knees
before
a
passion
whose
face
she
had
scarcely
seen
but
whose
voice
she
had
heard
and
still
now
in
her
new
life
remembered
she
had
had
her
moment
the
last
strains
of
its
dying
music
were
still
in
her
ears
she
caught
her
breath
then
turning
dismissed
it
and
standing
back
from
christopher
gave
him
her
last
word
but
look
after
francis
be
with
him
as
much
as
you
can
he
needs
all
that
you
can
spare
he
got
to
be
he
simply
to
be
the
success
of
the
family
chapter
xiii
epilogue
prologue
third
apparition
a
child
crowned
i
late
on
the
evening
of
may
christopher
heard
of
the
relief
of
mafeking
it
was
too
advanced
an
hour
he
understood
for
the
town
to
display
its
triumph
that
evening
let
christopher
wait
the
following
night
brun
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
many
months
appeared
the
clocks
had
struck
nine
and
christopher
was
finishing
his
dinner
when
the
little
man
shining
and
dapper
pleased
and
impersonal
was
shown
in
hullo
cried
christopher
thought
you
were
abroad
somewhere
i
saw
you
at
the
duchess
funeral
of
course
i
was
there
what
do
you
suppose
meanwhile
come
out
now
and
see
your
fine
people
make
manifestations
is
there
a
noise
a
noise
dieu
but
come
and
look
they
went
out
together
harley
street
was
silent
and
deserted
and
above
it
a
night
sky
scattered
with
stars
was
serenely
still
but
beyond
the
further
roofs
and
chimneys
golden
light
hovered
and
a
confused
murmur
like
the
buzzing
of
bees
hummed
upon
space
through
oxford
street
a
great
crowd
of
people
was
passing
but
it
was
a
crowd
hurrying
to
find
some
other
crowd
oxford
street
was
plainly
not
the
there
was
a
good
deal
of
shouting
and
singing
young
men
five
abreast
passed
girls
with
ticklers
and
whistles
screamed
and
laughed
and
sang
merry
bells
were
ringing
lights
flared
in
the
windows
and
now
and
again
a
rocket
with
a
whiz
and
a
shriek
flashed
into
the
sky
and
broke
with
a
little
angry
splutter
into
coloured
stars
they
crossed
into
bond
street
down
which
other
people
were
hurrying
sometimes
a
roaring
echo
of
a
multitude
of
discordant
voices
would
be
carried
to
them
and
then
would
be
hidden
again
as
though
some
huge
door
in
front
of
them
were
swinging
to
and
fro
at
the
end
of
bond
street
suddenly
as
they
might
turn
the
corner
of
some
sea
road
and
instantly
be
confronted
with
the
crash
of
a
plunging
surf
they
met
the
crowd
look
out
cried
brun
clutching
hold
of
christopher
arm
we
want
to
get
drawn
into
this
although
they
had
apparently
been
walking
quietly
down
bond
street
with
no
crowd
about
them
they
now
were
pursued
upon
all
sides
by
people
they
raised
themselves
on
to
a
doorstep
hanging
there
bending
their
feet
forward
and
feeling
that
if
the
crowd
in
front
of
them
were
for
a
moment
to
give
way
down
they
would
go
meanwhile
along
piccadilly
towards
the
clubs
and
hyde
park
corner
a
thick
mass
of
human
beings
was
pressing
this
gathering
seemed
of
itself
to
lack
all
human
quality
a
face
a
voice
a
hand
a
cry
these
things
might
now
and
again
as
fish
flash
in
a
stream
detach
themselves
sometimes
a
light
from
a
flaring
window
or
an
illumination
would
fling
into
pale
unreal
relief
a
bundle
of
faces
that
represented
at
that
instant
a
piece
of
human
history
but
sank
instantly
back
again
into
chaos
one
might
fancy
that
this
was
no
crowd
of
human
beings
but
some
new
unknown
creature
dragging
its
coils
from
the
sluggish
bed
of
some
hidden
river
stamping
to
destruction
as
it
went
then
as
though
one
were
watching
a
show
with
a
click
the
human
element
was
back
again
there
two
girls
their
hats
pushed
aside
their
hair
half
uncoiled
their
cheeks
flushed
their
eyes
partly
bold
and
partly
frightened
were
screaming
oo
yer
do
again
then
good
old
england
gawd
save
it
was
not
on
the
whole
a
crowd
stirred
only
by
national
joy
and
pride
it
may
in
its
units
when
it
first
left
its
many
homes
have
announced
its
intention
of
giving
a
jolly
for
our
splendid
country
and
our
beloved
queen
but
once
in
a
position
from
which
there
was
no
returning
once
in
the
hands
of
a
force
that
was
stronger
than
any
felt
before
it
had
forgotten
the
country
and
its
defeats
and
successes
only
two
courses
open
either
admit
fear
feel
that
the
breath
of
you
is
slowly
but
quite
surely
in
process
of
being
crushed
out
of
you
feel
that
your
arms
and
legs
are
being
torn
from
you
that
your
ribs
are
being
smashed
into
powder
and
that
your
heart
is
being
pressed
as
flat
as
a
pancake
let
then
panic
overwhelm
you
fight
and
scream
to
get
out
and
away
from
it
see
yourself
finally
falling
trampled
kicked
your
face
squashed
to
pulp
your
eyes
torn
out
your
breath
strangled
in
your
body
so
much
for
fear
or
on
the
other
hand
arouse
frenzy
be
above
and
beyond
your
body
scream
and
shout
rattle
rattles
and
blow
whistles
trample
upon
everything
that
is
near
you
smack
faces
with
your
hand
pull
off
clothing
and
scatter
hats
and
bonnets
scream
aloud
no
matter
what
it
is
that
you
are
screaming
let
your
voice
exclaim
that
at
length
at
length
you
a
miserable
clerk
on
nothing
a
week
in
the
city
are
for
the
first
time
in
your
existence
the
captain
of
your
soul
the
ruthless
master
of
a
wretched
tyrannous
world
so
much
for
frenzy
either
way
be
it
frenzy
or
fear
the
country
has
not
much
to
say
to
it
at
all
with
every
moment
it
seems
that
from
the
circus
more
bodies
more
arms
and
legs
are
being
pressed
and
crushed
and
packed
with
every
moment
the
clanging
of
the
bells
is
louder
the
fire
in
the
sky
higher
and
wilder
the
singing
the
screaming
the
oaths
and
the
curses
are
nearer
the
defiance
that
loss
of
individuality
gives
let
get
back
said
brun
he
turned
but
at
that
moment
someone
from
behind
him
cried
oo
are
yer
shoving
there
he
was
pushed
with
christopher
half
falling
half
clutching
at
arms
and
shoulders
forward
into
the
street
they
righted
themselves
brun
fastened
upon
christopher
arm
shouting
into
his
ear
we
better
go
along
with
the
crowd
for
a
bit
we
get
a
chance
of
cutting
up
half
moon
street
ca
do
anything
else
they
were
pressed
forward
now
received
into
the
bosom
of
the
crowd
they
were
conscious
both
of
the
human
element
and
of
the
stronger
composite
spirit
that
was
mightier
than
anything
human
a
creation
of
the
city
against
whose
walls
they
were
now
so
riotously
shouting
next
to
christopher
was
a
young
man
in
evening
dress
his
hat
had
disappeared
his
collar
was
torn
sweat
was
pouring
down
his
forehead
and
at
the
top
of
his
voice
he
screamed
again
and
again
good
old
england
good
old
england
good
old
bobs
good
old
bobs
squeezed
up
against
christopher
arm
was
a
stout
body
that
looked
as
though
it
had
once
belonged
to
some
elderly
gentleman
who
liked
white
waistcoats
and
brass
buttons
from
somewhere
in
obvious
connection
with
these
buttons
came
a
weak
breathless
voice
you
excuse
me
hanging
on
so
sir
it
familiar
not
my
way
but
this
crowd
a
girl
with
crimson
face
leant
against
christopher
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
tickled
his
face
with
a
feather
she
screamed
with
laughter
look
out
you
swine
somebody
shouted
and
shouted
out
did
bobs
come
along
you
stinking
nobs
we
will
show
you
around
them
above
them
below
them
there
tossed
a
whirlpool
of
noise
something
outside
and
beyond
the
immediate
sounds
that
they
were
making
bells
voices
shouts
that
seemed
to
have
no
human
origin
the
very
walls
and
stones
of
the
city
crying
aloud
then
opposite
the
entrance
to
half
moon
street
another
crowd
seemed
to
meet
them
there
was
pause
get
out
of
it
go
the
other
way
damn
yer
eyes
step
off
it
go
back
car
yer
it
was
then
that
for
the
briefest
moment
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
christopher
was
afraid
someone
was
pressing
into
his
back
until
surely
it
would
break
some
other
was
leaning
and
driving
his
chest
in
driving
it
so
that
the
breath
flooded
his
face
his
eyes
his
nose
colours
rose
and
fell
someone
evil
breath
burnt
upon
his
cheeks
light
flashed
before
him
in
broad
steady
flares
brun
brun
he
cried
all
right
a
voice
from
many
miles
away
answered
him
he
was
seized
with
the
determination
to
survive
they
thought
that
they
could
down
him
but
they
should
see
that
they
were
mistaken
his
rage
rising
he
was
no
longer
christopher
of
harley
street
but
something
savage
lawless
beyond
even
his
own
control
he
drove
with
his
arms
curses
met
him
and
someone
drove
back
into
him
and
a
ridiculous
face
with
staring
eyes
that
stupidly
pleaded
and
a
nose
that
was
white
and
trembling
and
a
mouth
that
dribbled
at
the
corners
came
up
against
his
keep
back
ca
you
someone
shouted
brun
brun
he
called
again
and
then
was
conscious
that
bodies
were
giving
way
before
him
his
hand
met
a
stomach
covered
with
cloth
and
little
hard
buttons
and
then
coming
against
a
woman
arm
soft
and
warm
christopher
had
instantly
gained
possession
of
his
soul
once
more
hope
i
did
hurt
you
he
heard
himself
saying
then
some
barrier
of
legs
and
bodies
yielding
found
that
he
was
flung
out
away
stumbling
in
spite
of
himself
on
to
his
knee
he
caught
someone
by
the
arm
and
it
was
brun
good
lord
said
christopher
it
all
right
answered
brun
we
in
half
moon
street
we
out
of
it
ii
somewhere
in
the
peaceful
retirement
behind
the
clubs
they
surveyed
one
another
and
then
laughed
brun
the
dapper
perfect
brun
had
a
bleeding
cheek
a
torn
waistcoat
and
a
large
and
very
unbecoming
tear
in
his
trousers
he
was
half
angry
and
half
amused
finally
a
survey
of
christopher
with
mud
on
his
nose
and
his
collar
hanging
from
one
button
and
revealing
a
fat
red
neck
restored
his
good
temper
you
better
come
back
with
me
said
christopher
and
be
cleaned
up
they
went
back
to
harley
street
and
half
an
hour
later
were
sitting
quietly
in
easy
chairs
with
the
house
as
though
it
were
made
of
so
silent
and
hidden
was
it
about
them
both
men
were
excited
christopher
had
been
changed
by
the
events
of
the
last
few
weeks
and
brun
if
he
had
not
been
so
personally
involved
had
seen
enough
to
excite
his
most
eager
curiosity
and
speculation
brun
sharp
little
eyes
flashing
across
the
tip
of
his
cigar
sought
christopher
large
comfortable
face
fell
from
there
over
his
large
comfortable
body
down
at
last
to
his
large
comfortable
boots
well
first
time
i
seen
a
continental
crowd
in
england
continental
always
your
englishman
however
excited
and
of
whatever
rank
knows
there
are
things
a
gentleman
does
do
those
people
had
not
that
knowledge
very
interesting
he
added
christopher
peacefully
smoked
his
body
well
spread
out
in
the
chair
his
broad
rather
fingers
clutching
devotedly
at
his
pipe
so
you
were
at
the
funeral
the
other
day
i
was
i
expect
i
mourned
her
more
sincerely
than
any
of
you
i
never
seen
her
but
she
meant
a
lot
to
me
as
a
symbol
and
i
like
symbols
better
than
human
beings
he
pulled
his
body
together
with
a
little
jerk
and
leaned
forward
christopher
do
you
remember
a
long
while
ago
going
into
a
gallery
in
bond
street
and
meeting
lady
adela
beaminster
there
and
lady
seddon
it
was
just
after
ross
portrait
was
first
shown
i
remember
said
christopher
nodding
his
head
you
were
there
i
was
i
was
there
with
arkwright
the
african
explorer
man
i
only
mention
the
day
because
arkwright
was
interested
in
lady
seddon
wanted
to
know
all
about
her
and
i
talked
a
bit
i
remember
my
point
to
him
was
that
there
was
a
situation
between
that
girl
and
her
grandmother
that
would
be
worth
anybody
watching
i
followed
it
myself
for
a
while
and
then
i
lost
it
but
you
a
friend
of
the
family
tell
me
christopher
what
happened
between
those
two
nothing
christopher
said
laughing
oh
nonsense
brun
answered
they
were
all
in
it
something
went
on
then
seddon
had
that
accident
breton
was
in
it
but
christopher
only
smiled
well
if
you
wo
i
have
my
own
idea
of
it
all
that
girl
was
a
fine
girl
and
the
old
woman
was
fine
too
but
how
they
must
have
hated
one
another
he
chuckled
then
sitting
back
in
his
chair
his
little
eyes
on
the
ceiling
he
said
almost
to
himself
once
years
ago
when
i
was
very
very
young
and
romantic
almost
just
for
a
year
or
two
i
loved
your
shelley
he
was
everything
i
could
quote
him
by
the
page
he
gone
from
me
now
or
most
of
him
has
but
there
was
one
line
that
seemed
to
me
then
the
most
romantic
thing
i
had
ever
read
and
has
remained
with
me
always
it
went
we
have
fires
out
of
the
grand
wood
it
in
the
letter
to
maria
gisborne
i
think
i
quite
forgotten
what
the
context
is
now
it
all
pretty
trivial
and
unimportant
but
those
were
the
days
when
i
made
pictures
i
saw
it
lord
christopher
how
it
comes
back
the
wood
very
thick
very
large
very
black
no
sun
very
still
and
the
great
house
behind
it
huge
and
white
with
long
gardens
and
green
lawns
and
peacocks
and
the
grand
duke
with
his
powdered
wig
and
shoes
his
gorgeous
suit
his
jewelled
sword
his
snuff
and
his
wine
his
silly
little
yellow
face
then
the
rabble
dirty
smelling
fellows
breaking
through
the
silence
tearing
up
the
wood
knocking
down
the
palace
hanging
the
grand
duke
from
a
tree
last
of
all
setting
the
whole
thing
into
the
most
splendid
blaze
oh
of
course
that
was
context
was
all
about
boiling
a
kettle
or
something
but
the
way
i
saw
it
just
like
that
nothing
stirred
brun
like
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
and
now
he
was
getting
very
excited
indeed
and
was
waving
his
hands
yes
said
christopher
placidly
very
dramatic
what
does
it
all
mean
well
this
it
seems
to
me
that
that
just
what
been
happening
over
here
your
duchess
is
dead
and
instead
there
is
crowd
the
grand
duke
is
gone
and
all
that
was
his
now
for
the
fires
christopher
filling
his
pipe
paused
and
then
his
voice
grave
and
serious
romantics
aside
brun
for
a
minute
do
you
remember
your
tiger
idea
you
delivered
to
me
once
i
often
thought
of
it
since
you
said
then
that
the
reason
why
the
duchess
and
her
times
the
grand
duke
and
his
wood
had
got
to
go
was
because
their
policy
had
been
to
give
the
tigers
of
the
world
no
liberty
to
pretend
indeed
that
they
there
and
that
now
the
time
had
come
when
every
man
should
declare
his
tiger
should
give
it
liberty
and
whether
he
restrained
it
or
no
acknowledge
its
existence
well
now
what
i
want
to
know
is
this
what
to
your
thinking
is
going
to
come
of
it
all
i
i
like
the
old
settled
laws
and
customs
and
the
rest
of
it
and
yet
not
afraid
of
this
new
individualism
but
what
i
expect
and
what
you
expect
to
come
of
it
all
are
sure
to
be
mightily
different
things
they
are
said
brun
laughing
you
see
christopher
as
i
often
said
to
you
before
you
a
sentimentalist
people
matter
to
you
you
concerned
in
their
individual
good
or
bad
luck
now
none
of
that
is
worth
anything
to
me
i
observe
from
the
outside
always
what
i
want
to
see
is
less
muddle
more
brain
less
waste
of
time
more
progress
i
believe
the
loosing
of
the
tiger
is
going
to
bring
that
about
why
i
welcome
it
i
do
care
one
little
damn
about
your
individual
let
him
be
sacrificed
every
time
for
the
general
wisdom
your
duchess
she
was
good
for
her
age
now
she
is
against
progress
she
vanishes
that
crowd
of
has
swept
her
away
there
be
a
chaos
here
for
a
time
people
like
the
ruddards
will
mix
things
up
a
woman
like
strode
will
destroy
as
many
good
people
as
she
can
but
the
time
will
come
out
of
that
crowd
that
we
got
into
a
world
ruled
by
brain
by
common
sense
by
understanding
not
by
sentiment
and
confusion
will
arise
may
i
not
be
with
the
good
god
and
confusion
said
christopher
smiling
that
me
i
suppose
well
you
sentimental
said
brun
you
stuffed
with
it
do
you
yourself
asked
christopher
is
there
no
one
no
one
in
the
world
who
matters
to
you
nobody
said
brun
no
one
in
the
world
i
think
i
like
you
better
than
anybody
you
the
honestest
man
i
know
and
yet
one
of
the
most
yes
i
like
you
very
much
but
it
would
not
be
true
to
say
that
it
would
leave
any
great
blank
in
my
life
if
you
were
to
die
women
yes
there
have
been
women
but
thank
the
good
god
for
the
moment
only
the
heart
no
the
brain
yes
well
then
said
christopher
that
all
clear
enough
it
is
very
wonderful
that
we
differ
people
are
to
me
everything
love
the
only
power
in
the
world
to
make
change
to
work
miracles
i
do
mean
only
sensual
love
or
even
sexual
love
but
simply
the
love
of
one
human
being
for
another
the
love
that
leads
to
thinking
more
of
your
neighbour
than
yourself
the
only
curb
for
your
tiger
brun
i
been
watching
it
in
a
piece
of
private
history
all
this
last
year
and
a
half
there
might
have
been
the
most
horrible
mess
saved
it
all
the
time
you
say
that
all
this
is
so
vague
and
loose
that
it
worth
nothing
not
at
all
said
brun
politely
go
ahead
well
then
the
reason
why
i
and
philistine
as
i
am
hail
the
passing
of
the
grand
duke
with
joy
and
i
cared
for
the
old
woman
mind
you
is
just
this
i
see
some
chance
at
last
for
the
plain
man
not
the
clever
man
or
the
especially
spiritual
man
or
the
wealthy
man
but
simply
the
ordinary
man
when
i
say
brotherhood
i
do
mean
anything
to
do
with
associations
or
meetings
or
rules
simply
that
i
believe
in
an
age
when
a
man
neighbour
will
matter
to
a
man
more
than
himself
when
it
wo
be
priggish
or
weak
to
help
someone
in
worse
plight
than
yourself
when
it
will
simply
be
the
obvious
thing
when
above
all
there
be
no
jealousy
no
getting
in
a
man
way
because
he
does
better
than
you
no
knocking
a
man
down
because
he
sees
the
world
this
world
and
the
next
differently
that
my
individualism
my
rising
city
and
if
you
had
watched
the
lives
of
a
few
friends
of
mine
during
the
last
year
or
two
as
i
watched
them
you
know
that
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
is
the
fire
that
going
to
burn
all
the
woods
in
the
world
in
time
brun
laughed
you
be
taken
in
horribly
one
of
these
days
christopher
you
speak
as
though
i
were
a
chicken
christopher
broke
out
indignantly
man
alive
have
i
lived
all
these
years
have
i
seen
the
poorest
and
rottenest
and
feeblest
side
of
human
nature
time
and
time
again
but
this
i
know
that
it
losing
the
thing
you
prize
most
that
pays
it
the
pursuit
the
the
forgetting
of
self
that
scores
in
the
material
practical
world
as
well
as
the
spiritual
heavenly
one
that
where
the
millennium
coming
from
brains
as
well
perhaps
but
souls
first
we
see
said
brun
a
bit
of
both
i
dare
say
anyhow
it
the
next
generation
that
going
to
be
interesting
all
kinds
of
people
free
who
never
been
free
before
all
sorts
of
creeds
and
doctrines
smashed
that
seemed
like
eternity
the
old
woods
flaming
already
la
duchesse
but
as
for
your
love
your
brotherhood
christopher
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
human
nature
will
change
very
little
unselfishness
very
fine
to
talk
about
but
who
going
to
practise
it
every
man
for
his
own
hand
now
as
ever
we
see
answered
christopher
i
not
clever
at
putting
things
into
words
if
i
were
to
go
along
to
the
man
in
the
street
and
say
here
i
made
a
discovery
i
got
something
that
going
to
make
everything
straight
in
the
world
and
he
were
to
say
that
and
then
i
were
to
answer
unselfishness
love
of
your
neighbour
he
would
of
course
instantly
remind
me
that
someone
greater
than
myself
had
made
the
same
remark
a
few
thousand
years
ago
he
be
right
there
nothing
new
in
it
but
it
coming
new
to
the
world
just
because
the
laws
and
conventions
that
covered
it
are
breaking
the
tiger
in
every
man
and
to
curb
it
my
prophecy
brun
brun
gave
himself
a
no
idea
you
were
such
a
talker
christopher
but
i
right
all
the
same
he
held
up
his
glass
here
to
the
tiger
in
the
next
generation
he
drank
then
held
it
up
again
and
here
he
cried
to
the
memory
of
the
last
great
lady
in
england
iii
when
brim
had
gone
it
seemed
that
he
had
left
that
last
toast
of
his
in
the
air
behind
him
christopher
was
haunted
by
the
thought
of
the
duchess
he
felt
her
with
him
in
the
room
she
stirred
him
to
restlessness
so
that
at
last
desperately
he
took
his
hat
and
went
out
his
steps
took
him
round
the
corner
to
portland
place
here
all
was
very
quiet
a
few
cabs
in
the
middle
of
the
street
a
few
lights
in
the
windows
the
silver
field
of
stars
in
the
distance
the
sky
golden
fired
now
and
again
into
life
as
a
rocket
rose
shielding
beneath
its
glow
all
that
stirring
multitude
sounds
rose
a
cry
a
shout
singing
then
died
down
again
he
was
outside
no
he
thought
that
he
would
ring
and
see
whether
newton
were
in
perhaps
she
had
gone
to
bed
it
was
after
eleven
but
if
she
were
there
he
would
take
one
last
look
at
the
portrait
before
it
was
packed
up
and
sent
down
to
beaminster
newton
unbolted
the
door
and
smiled
when
she
saw
him
i
was
just
going
to
bed
there
only
myself
and
louisa
here
and
the
watchman
i
wo
keep
you
newton
he
said
the
fancy
just
took
me
to
look
at
some
of
the
pictures
once
more
before
they
packed
up
lady
seddon
told
me
that
a
good
many
of
them
were
to
be
packed
up
they
wo
look
quite
the
same
at
beaminster
no
that
they
wo
sir
said
newton
i
shall
miss
the
old
house
just
to
think
of
the
years
and
now
all
of
us
scattered
she
lit
a
lamp
for
him
and
he
went
up
the
stone
staircase
found
the
long
and
there
on
the
farther
wall
the
portrait
the
furniture
shrouded
in
brown
holland
waited
like
ghostly
watchers
on
every
side
of
him
the
huge
house
always
a
place
of
strange
silences
and
vast
disturbances
multiplied
now
in
its
long
mirrors
and
its
air
of
cold
suspense
as
though
it
were
waiting
for
something
to
happen
showed
its
recognition
of
death
and
death
consequences
but
the
portrait
was
alive
as
he
held
the
lamp
up
to
it
the
face
leapt
into
agitation
the
eyes
were
bent
once
again
sharply
upon
him
the
mouth
curved
to
speak
the
black
silk
rustled
against
the
chair
a
host
of
memories
crowded
the
room
he
was
filled
with
a
regret
more
poignant
than
anything
that
he
had
felt
since
her
death
she
fine
i
miss
her
more
than
i
had
any
notion
that
i
would
she
stirred
one
up
she
made
one
alive
he
put
the
lamp
upon
the
floor
and
sat
down
for
a
minute
amongst
the
shrouded
furniture
his
mind
passed
from
brun
generalizations
to
the
little
bundle
of
people
whom
he
knew
rachel
francis
roddy
lizzie
rand
to
all
of
them
the
tiger
moment
had
come
and
out
of
it
all
out
of
the
stress
and
suffering
and
struggle
rachel
child
was
to
be
born
instead
of
the
duchess
the
new
generation
instead
of
this
old
house
the
hooded
furniture
the
anger
at
all
freedom
of
thought
the
jealousy
of
all
enterprise
the
slander
and
the
malice
an
age
of
a
universal
brotherhood
of
unselfishness
restraint
charity
tolerance
perhaps
after
all
he
an
old
sentimental
fool
there
had
always
been
those
at
every
birth
and
every
death
who
had
had
their
dreams
of
new
human
nature
new
worlds
new
virtues
and
moralities
he
looked
his
last
at
the
portrait
i
nearly
as
old
as
you
i
shall
go
soon
but
i
miss
you
you
be
yourself
surprised
if
you
knew
how
much
he
took
up
the
lamp
and
left
her
he
said
good
night
to
newton
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
house
he
looked
about
him
portland
place
was
like
a
broad
river
running
silently
into
the
dark
trees
at
the
end
of
it
there
was
a
great
rest
and
quiet
here
southwards
the
sky
flamed
the
noise
of
a
great
multitude
of
people
came
muffled
across
space
with
the
rhythm
in
it
of
a
beating
song
rockets
slashed
the
sky
broke
into
golden
stars
the
bells
from
all
the
churches
in
the
town
clashed
and
from
some
great
distance
guns
solemnly
booming
rolled
through
the
air
christopher
standing
there
smiled
as
he
thought
of
brun
little
picture
brun
springing
up
of
course
at
the
right
moment
to
point
his
moral
brun
who
appeared
like
some
in
city
after
city
with
his
conclusion
his
prophecy
neat
and
prepared
and
we
have
fires
out
of
the
grand
duke
wood
there
was
the
wood
there
the
mob
there
the
grand
duke
dead
and
buried
christopher
shrugged
his
shoulders
whatever
brun
might
say
human
beings
were
more
than
summaries
prophecies
conclusions
as
he
looked
towards
the
trees
and
felt
a
little
breeze
caress
his
face
with
he
could
swear
some
salt
of
the
sea
he
thought
of
the
human
beings
who
were
his
friends
rachel
roddy
lizzie
francis
and
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
out
of
the
trees
down
the
shining
surface
of
portland
place
a
figure
came
towards
him
the
figure
of
rachel
child
novels
by
hugh
walpole
in
the
wooden
horse
maradick
at
forty
the
gods
and
perrin
the
prelude
to
adventure
fortitude
rising
the
duchess
of
wrexe
the
green
mirror
