illustration
the
little
milliner
it
was
too
true
that
the
city
was
growing
rapidly
as
yet
its
arms
were
not
long
enough
to
embrace
the
little
village
of
viger
but
before
long
they
would
be
and
it
was
not
a
time
that
the
inhabitants
looked
forward
to
with
any
pleasure
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
few
places
were
more
pleasant
to
live
in
the
houses
amid
the
trees
clustered
around
the
slim
steeple
of
joseph
s
which
flashed
like
a
naked
poniard
in
the
sun
they
were
old
and
the
village
was
sleepy
almost
dozing
since
the
mill
behind
the
rise
of
land
on
the
blanche
had
shut
down
the
miller
had
died
and
who
would
trouble
to
grind
what
little
grist
came
to
the
mill
when
flour
was
so
cheap
but
while
the
lasted
and
the
blanche
continued
to
run
it
seemed
impossible
that
any
change
could
come
the
change
was
coming
however
rapidly
enough
even
now
on
still
nights
above
the
noise
of
the
frogs
in
the
pools
you
could
hear
the
rumble
of
the
and
the
faint
tinkle
of
their
bells
and
when
the
air
was
moist
the
whole
southern
sky
was
luminous
with
the
reflection
of
thousands
of
but
when
the
time
came
for
viger
to
be
mentioned
in
the
city
papers
as
one
of
the
outlying
wards
what
a
change
there
would
be
there
would
be
no
unfenced
fields
full
of
little
inequalities
and
covered
with
short
grass
there
would
be
no
deep
pools
where
the
quarries
had
been
and
where
the
boys
pelted
the
frogs
there
would
be
no
more
where
the
children
could
gather
nuts
and
the
dread
pool
which
had
filled
the
shaft
where
old
daigneau
years
ago
mined
for
gold
would
cease
to
exist
but
in
the
meantime
the
boys
of
viger
roamed
over
the
unclosed
fields
and
pelted
the
frogs
and
the
boldest
ventured
to
roll
huge
stones
into
daigneau
s
pit
and
only
waited
to
see
the
green
slime
come
working
up
to
the
surface
before
scampering
away
their
flesh
creeping
with
the
idea
that
it
was
old
daigneau
himself
who
was
stirring
up
the
water
in
a
rage
new
houses
had
already
commenced
to
spring
up
in
all
directions
and
there
was
a
large
influx
of
the
laboring
population
which
overflows
from
large
cities
even
on
the
main
street
of
viger
on
a
lot
which
had
been
vacant
ever
since
it
was
a
lot
the
workmen
had
built
a
foundation
after
a
while
it
was
finished
when
men
from
the
city
came
and
put
up
the
oddest
wooden
house
that
one
could
imagine
it
was
perfectly
square
there
was
a
window
and
a
door
in
front
a
window
at
the
side
and
a
window
upstairs
there
were
many
surmises
as
to
the
probable
occupant
of
such
a
diminutive
habitation
and
the
widow
laroque
who
made
dresses
and
trimmed
hats
and
whose
shop
was
directly
opposite
and
next
door
to
the
post
office
suffered
greatly
from
unsatisfied
curiosity
no
one
who
looked
like
the
proprietor
was
ever
seen
near
the
place
the
foreman
of
the
laborers
who
were
working
at
the
house
seemed
to
know
nothing
all
that
he
said
in
answer
to
questions
was
i
have
my
at
last
the
house
was
ready
it
was
painted
within
and
without
and
madame
laroque
could
scarcely
believe
her
eyes
when
one
morning
a
man
came
from
the
city
with
a
small
sign
under
his
arm
and
nailed
it
above
the
door
it
bore
these
words
mademoiselle
viau
ah
said
madame
laroque
the
bread
is
to
be
taken
out
of
my
the
next
day
came
a
load
of
furniture
a
very
large
load
as
there
was
only
a
small
stove
two
tables
a
bedstead
three
chairs
a
sort
of
lounge
and
two
large
boxes
the
man
who
brought
the
things
put
them
in
the
house
and
locked
the
door
on
them
when
he
went
away
then
nothing
happened
for
two
weeks
but
madame
laroque
watched
such
a
queer
little
house
it
was
as
it
stood
there
so
new
in
its
coat
of
paint
it
looked
just
like
a
square
bandbox
which
some
titan
had
made
for
his
wife
and
there
seemed
no
doubt
that
if
you
took
hold
of
the
chimney
and
lifted
the
roof
off
you
would
see
the
gigantic
bonnet
with
its
strings
and
ribbons
which
the
titaness
could
wear
to
church
on
sundays
madame
laroque
wondered
how
mademoiselle
viau
would
come
whether
in
a
cab
with
her
trunks
and
boxes
piled
around
her
or
on
foot
and
have
her
belongings
on
a
cart
she
watched
every
approaching
vehicle
for
two
weeks
in
vain
but
one
morning
she
saw
that
a
curtain
had
been
put
up
on
the
window
opposite
that
it
was
partly
raised
and
that
a
geranium
was
standing
on
the
sill
for
one
hour
she
never
took
her
eyes
off
the
door
and
at
last
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
it
open
a
trim
little
person
not
very
young
dressed
in
gray
stepped
out
on
the
platform
with
her
apron
full
of
crumbs
and
cast
them
down
for
the
birds
then
without
looking
around
she
went
in
and
closed
the
door
it
was
mademoiselle
viau
the
bird
is
in
its
nest
thought
the
old
postmaster
who
lived
alone
with
his
mother
all
that
madame
laroque
said
was
ah
mademoiselle
viau
did
not
stir
out
that
day
but
on
the
next
she
went
to
the
baker
s
and
the
butcher
s
and
came
over
the
road
to
monsieur
cuerrier
the
postmaster
who
also
kept
a
grocery
that
evening
according
to
her
custom
madame
laroque
called
on
madame
cuerrier
we
have
a
neighbor
she
said
she
was
making
purchases
she
will
expect
people
to
make
without
it
is
very
tormenting
this
to
have
these
irresponsible
girls
that
no
one
knows
anything
about
setting
up
shops
under
our
very
noses
why
does
she
live
alone
i
did
not
ask
her
answered
cuerrier
to
whom
the
question
was
addressed
you
are
very
cool
monsieur
cuerrier
but
if
it
was
a
young
man
and
a
postmaster
instead
of
a
young
woman
and
a
milliner
you
would
not
relish
there
can
be
only
one
postmaster
said
cuerrier
in
paris
where
i
practised
my
art
said
monsieur
villeblanc
who
was
a
retired
hairdresser
there
were
whole
rows
of
tonsorial
parlors
and
every
one
had
enough
to
madame
laroque
sniffed
as
she
always
did
in
his
presence
did
you
see
her
hat
she
asked
i
did
and
it
was
very
nice
with
the
flowers
all
on
one
side
i
wouldn
t
go
to
thérèse
with
it
thérèse
was
the
postmaster
s
native
place
the
girl
has
no
taste
she
continued
well
if
she
hasn
t
you
needn
t
be
afraid
of
there
will
be
no
choice
between
you
said
the
retired
hairdresser
maliciously
but
there
was
a
choice
between
them
and
all
the
young
girls
of
viger
chose
mademoiselle
viau
it
was
said
she
had
such
an
eye
she
would
take
a
hat
and
pin
a
bow
on
here
and
loop
a
ribbon
there
and
cast
a
flower
on
somewhere
else
all
the
time
surveying
her
work
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
her
mouth
bristling
with
pins
there
how
do
you
like
that
it
it
is
not
and
in
a
trice
the
desired
change
was
made
she
had
no
lack
of
work
from
the
first
soon
she
had
too
much
to
do
at
all
hours
of
the
day
she
could
be
seen
sitting
at
her
window
working
and
she
must
be
making
money
fast
argued
madame
laroque
for
she
spends
in
truth
she
spent
very
lived
so
plainly
three
times
a
week
she
took
a
fresh
twist
from
the
baker
once
a
day
the
milkman
left
a
pint
of
milk
and
once
every
week
mademoiselle
herself
stepped
out
to
the
butcher
s
and
bought
a
pound
of
steak
occasionally
she
mailed
a
letter
which
she
always
gave
into
the
hands
of
the
postmaster
if
he
was
not
there
she
asked
for
a
pound
of
tea
or
something
else
that
she
needed
she
was
fast
friends
with
cuerrier
but
with
no
one
else
as
she
never
received
visitors
once
only
did
a
young
man
call
on
her
it
was
young
jourdain
the
clerk
in
the
store
he
had
knocked
at
the
door
and
was
admitted
ah
said
madame
laroque
it
is
the
young
men
who
can
but
the
next
moment
monsieur
jourdain
came
out
and
strangely
enough
was
so
bewildered
as
to
forget
to
put
on
his
hat
it
was
not
this
young
man
who
could
conquer
there
is
something
mysterious
about
that
young
person
said
madame
laroque
between
her
teeth
yes
replied
cuerrier
very
minds
her
own
bah
said
the
widow
who
can
tell
what
her
business
is
she
who
comes
from
no
one
knows
where
but
i
ll
find
out
what
all
this
secrecy
means
trust
me
so
the
widow
watched
the
little
house
and
its
occupant
very
closely
and
these
are
some
of
the
things
she
saw
every
morning
an
open
door
and
crumbs
for
the
birds
the
watering
of
the
geranium
which
was
just
going
to
flower
a
small
figure
going
in
and
out
dressed
in
gray
and
oftener
than
anything
else
the
same
figure
sitting
at
the
window
working
this
continued
for
a
year
with
little
variation
but
still
the
widow
watched
every
one
else
had
accepted
the
presence
of
the
new
resident
as
a
benefaction
they
had
got
accustomed
to
her
they
called
her
the
little
old
cuerrier
called
her
the
little
one
in
but
she
was
not
yet
adjusted
in
the
widow
s
system
of
things
she
laid
a
plot
with
her
second
cousin
which
was
that
the
cousin
should
get
a
hat
made
by
mademoiselle
viau
and
that
she
should
ask
her
some
questions
mademoiselle
viau
were
you
born
in
the
city
i
do
not
think
mademoiselle
that
green
will
become
no
perhaps
not
where
did
you
live
before
you
came
here
mademoiselle
this
gray
shape
is
very
and
so
on
that
plan
would
not
work
but
before
long
something
very
suspicious
happened
one
evening
just
about
dusk
as
madame
laroque
was
walking
up
and
down
in
front
of
her
door
a
man
of
a
youthful
appearance
came
quickly
up
the
street
stepped
upon
mademoiselle
viau
s
platform
opened
the
door
without
knocking
and
walked
in
mademoiselle
was
working
in
the
last
vestige
of
daylight
and
the
widow
watched
her
like
a
lynx
she
worked
on
unconcernedly
and
when
it
became
so
dark
that
she
could
not
see
she
lit
her
lamp
and
pulled
down
the
curtain
that
night
madame
laroque
did
not
go
into
cuerrier
s
it
commenced
to
rain
but
she
put
on
a
large
frieze
coat
of
the
deceased
laroque
and
crouched
in
the
dark
she
was
very
much
interested
in
this
case
but
her
interest
brought
no
additional
knowledge
she
had
seen
the
man
go
in
he
was
rather
young
and
about
the
medium
height
and
had
a
black
mustache
she
could
remember
him
distinctly
but
she
did
not
see
him
come
out
the
next
morning
mademoiselle
viau
s
curtain
went
up
as
usual
and
as
it
was
her
day
to
go
to
the
butcher
s
she
went
out
while
she
was
away
madame
laroque
took
a
long
look
in
at
the
side
window
but
there
was
nothing
to
see
except
the
lounge
and
the
table
while
madame
laroque
had
been
watching
in
the
rain
cuerrier
was
reading
to
villeblanc
from
hello
said
he
and
then
went
on
reading
to
himself
have
you
lost
your
voice
asked
villeblanc
getting
nettled
no
no
listen
to
daring
jewel
robbery
a
thief
in
the
these
were
the
headings
of
the
column
and
then
followed
the
particulars
in
the
morning
the
widow
borrowed
the
paper
as
she
had
been
too
busy
the
night
before
to
come
and
hear
it
read
she
looked
over
the
front
page
when
her
eye
caught
the
heading
daring
jewel
robbery
and
she
read
the
whole
story
as
she
neared
the
end
her
eyebrows
commenced
to
travel
up
her
forehead
as
if
they
were
going
to
hide
in
her
hair
and
with
an
expression
of
surprise
she
tossed
the
paper
to
her
second
cousin
look
here
she
said
read
this
out
to
the
second
cousin
commenced
to
read
at
the
top
no
no
right
the
man
durocher
who
is
suspected
of
the
crime
is
not
tall
wears
a
heavy
mustache
has
gray
eyes
and
wears
an
in
his
left
ear
he
has
not
been
seen
since
i
told
you
so
exclaimed
the
widow
you
told
me
nothing
of
the
kind
said
the
second
cousin
he
had
no
in
his
ear
said
the
it
was
the
ear
that
i
saw
hand
me
my
shawl
where
are
you
going
i
have
business
never
mind
she
took
the
paper
with
her
and
went
straight
to
the
constable
but
said
he
i
can
not
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
you
must
come
but
he
will
be
desperate
he
will
face
me
like
a
never
mind
you
will
have
the
well
wait
and
the
constable
went
upstairs
to
get
his
pistol
he
came
down
with
his
blue
coat
on
he
was
a
very
fat
man
and
was
out
of
breath
when
he
came
to
the
little
milliner
s
but
who
shall
i
ask
for
he
inquired
of
madame
laroque
just
search
the
house
and
i
will
see
that
he
does
not
escape
by
the
back
she
had
forgotten
that
there
was
no
back
door
do
you
want
a
bonnet
asked
mademoiselle
viau
she
was
on
excellent
terms
with
the
constable
no
said
he
sternly
you
have
a
man
in
this
house
and
i
have
come
to
find
indeed
said
mademoiselle
very
stiffly
will
you
be
pleased
to
proceed
yes
said
he
taking
out
his
pistol
and
cocking
it
i
will
first
look
he
did
so
and
only
frightened
a
cat
from
under
the
stove
no
one
knew
that
mademoiselle
viau
had
a
cat
lead
the
way
upstairs
commanded
the
constable
i
am
afraid
of
your
pistol

not
go
first
he
went
first
and
entered
at
once
the
only
room
for
there
was
no
hall
in
the
mean
time
madame
laroque
had
found
out
that
there
was
no
back
door
and
had
come
into
the
lower
flat
and
reinspected
it
looking
under
everything
open
that
closet
said
the
constable
as
he
levelled
his
pistol
at
the
door
mademoiselle
threw
open
the
door
and
sprang
away
with
her
hands
over
her
ears
there
was
no
one
there
neither

there
any
one
under
the
bed
open
that
trunk
eying
the
little
box
monsieur

she
stooped
over
the
trunk
and
threw
back

lid

the
top

a
dainty
white
skirt
embroidered
beautifully
the
little
milliner
was
blushing
violently
that

said
the
constable
there
is
no
one

out
of
the
road
he
cried
to
the
knot
of
people
who
had
collected
at
the
door
i
have
been
for
my
wife
s
bonnet
it
is
not
but
the
people
looked
at
his
pistol
which
he
had
forgotten
to
put
away
he
went
across
to
the
widow
s
look
here
he
said

pistol

monsieur
cuerrier
inquired
madame
laroque
that
night

it
that
mademoiselle
viau
writes
to
i
am
an
official
of
the
government
i
do

secrets

those
letters
which
the
state
would
like
to
that
is
not
my
business
i
only
send
the
letters
where
they
are
posted
and
refuse
to
tell
amiable
widows
where
they
the
hairdresser
forgetting
his
constant
fear
of
disarranging
his
attire
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
wildly
trust
a
barber
to
laugh
said
the
widow
villeblanc
sobered
up
and
look
sadly
at
cuerrier
he
could
not
bear
to
be
called
a
barber
and
you
uphold
her
in
person
who
comes
from
no
one
knows
where
and
writes
to
no
one
knows
i
know
who
she
writes
the
widow
got
furious
yes
who
she
writes
of
course
you
person
who
comes
out
of
her
house
without
ever
having
gone
into
it
and
who
is
visited
by
men
who
go
in
and
never
come
how
do
you
know
he
went
in
i
saw
how
do
you
know
he
never
came
out
i
didn
t
see
ah
then
you
were
watching
well
what
if
i
was
the
devil

a
hand
in
i
have
no
doubt
said
cuerrier
insinuatingly
enough
fool
exclaimed
the
but
wait
i
have
not
done
yet
you
had
better
rest
or
you
will
have
the
law
on
the
widow
was
afraid
of
the
law
about
six
months
after
this
when
the
snow
was
coming
on
a
messenger
came
from
the
city
with
a
telegram
for
monsieur
least
it
was
in
his
care
he
very
seldom
went
out
but
he
got
his
boots
and
went
across
to
mademoiselle
viau
s
the
telegram
was
for
her
when
she
had
read
it
she
crushed
it
in
her
hand
and
leaned
against
the
wall
but
she
recovered
herself
monsieur
cuerrier
you
have
always
been
a
good
friend
to
me
i
must
go
will
watch
my
little
place
when
i
am
gone
the
postmaster
was
struck
with
pity
and
he
assisted
her
she
left
that
night
the
widow
hissed
in
his
ear
the
first
chance
she
got
about
three
weeks
after
this
when
madame
laroque
asked
for
cuerrier
refused
to
give
it
to
her
where
is
it
it
has
been
said
the
widow
derisively
well
i
will
find
in
an
hour
she
came
back
with
the
paper
there
said
she
thrusting
it
under
the
postmaster
s
nose
so
that
he
could
not
get
his
pipe
back
to
his
mouth
cuerrier
looked
consciously
at
the
paragraph
which
she
had
pointed
out
he
had
seen
it
before
our
readers
will
remember
that
the
police
while
attempting
to
arrest
one
ellwell
for
the
which
occurred
in
the
city
some
time
ago
were
compelled
to
fire
on
the
man
in
he
died
last
night
in
the
arms
of
a
female
relative
who
had
been
sent
for
at
his
request
he
was
known
by
various
gillet
the
police
have
had
much
trouble
with
there
said
the
widow
well
what
of
that
he
died
in
the
arms
of
a
female
well
were
you
the
relative
indeed
my
fine
fellow
be
careful
do
you
think
i
would
be
the
female
relative
of
a
convict
do
you
not
know
any
of
these
names
the
postmaster
felt
guilty
he
did
know
one
of
the
names
they
are
common
enough
he
replied
the
name
of
my
aunt
s
second
husband
was
it
will
not
do
said
the
widow
somebody
builds
a
house
no
one
knows
who
people
come
and
go
no
one
knows
how
and
you
a
stupid
postmaster
shut
your
eyes
and
help
things
three
days
after
this
mademoiselle
viau
came
home
she
was
no
longer
the
little
one
in
gray
she
was
the
little
one
in
black
she
came
straight
to
monsieur
cuerrier
to
get
her
cat
then
she
went
home
the
widow
watched
her
go
in
now
she
said
we
will
not
see
her
come
out
mademoiselle
viau
refused
to
take
any
more
work
she
was
sick
she
said
she
wanted
to
rest
she
rested
for
two
weeks
and
monsieur
cuerrier
brought
her
food
ready
cooked
then
he
stopped
she
was
better
one
evening
madame
laroque
peeped
in
at
the
side
window
she
saw
the
little
milliner
quite
distinctly
she
was
on
her
knees
her
face
was
hidden
in
her
arms
the
fire
was
very
bright
and
the
lamp
was
lighted
two
days
after
that
the
widow
said
to
cuerrier
it
is
very
strange
there
is
no
smoke
has
mademoiselle
viau
gone
away
yes
she
has
did
you
see
her
go
it
is
as
i
one
has
seen
her
go
but
wait
she
will
come
back
and
no
one
will
see
her
that
was
three
years
ago
and
she
has
not
come
back
all
the
white
curtains
are
pulled
down
between
the
one
that
covers
the
front
window
and
the
sash
stands
the
pot
in
which
grew
the
geranium
it
only
had
one
blossom
all
the
time
it
was
alive
and
it
is
dead
now
and
looks
like
a
dry
stick
no
one
knows
what
will
become
of
the
house
madame
laroque
thinks
that
monsieur
cuerrier
knows
she
expects
some
morning
to
look
across
and
see
the
little
milliner
cast
down
crumbs
for
the
birds
in
the
meantime
in
every
corner
of
the
house
the
spiders
are
weaving
webs
and
an
enterprising
caterpillar
has
blocked
up
the
with
his
cocoon
the
desjardins
just
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
where
the
bridge
crossed
the
blanche
stood
one
of
the
oldest
houses
in
viger
it
was
built
of
massive
timbers
the
roof
curved
and
projected
beyond
the
eaves
forming
the
top
of
a
narrow
veranda
the
whole
house
was
painted
a
dazzling
white
except
the
which
were
green
there
was
a
low
stone
fence
between
the
road
and
the
garden
where
a
few
simple
flowers
grew
beyond
the
fence
was
a
row
of
lombardy
poplars
some
of
which
had
commenced
to
die
out
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
was
a
marshy
field
where
by
day
the
marsh
marigolds
shone
and
by
night
the
there
were
places
in
this
field
where
you
could
thrust
down
a
long
pole
and
not
touch
bottom
in
the
fall
a
few
built
a
house
there
in
remembrance
of
the
time
when
it
was
a
favorite
in
the
spring
the
blanche
came
up
and
flowed
over
it
beyond
that
again
the
hill
curved
round
with
a
scarped
yellowish
slope
in
this
house
lived
adèle
desjardin
with
her
two
brothers
charles
and
philippe
their
father
was
dead
and
when
he
died
there
was
hardly
a
person
in
the
whole
parish
who
was
sorry
they
could
remember
him
as
a
tall
dark
man
with
long
arms
out
of
all
proportion
to
his
body
he
had
inherited
his
fine
farm
from
his
father
and
had
added
to
and
improved
it
he
had
always
been
prosperous
and
was
considered
the
wealthiest
man
in
the
parish
he
was
inhospitable
and
became
more
taciturn
and
morose
after
his
wife
died
his
pride
was
excessive
and
kept
him
from
associating
with
his
neighbors
although
he
was
in
no
way
above
them
very
little
was
known
about
his
manner
of
life
and
there
was
a
mystery
about
his
father
s
death
for
some
time
the
old
man
had
not
been
seen
about
the
place
when
one
day
he
came
from
the
city
dead
and
in
his
coffin
which
was
thought
strange
this
gave
rise
to
all
sorts
of
rumor
and
gossip
but
the
generally
accredited
story
was
that
there
was
insanity
in
the
family
and
that
he
had
died
crazy
however
cold
isidore
desjardin
was
to
his
neighbors
no
one
could
have
charged
him
with
being
unkind
or
harsh
with
his
children
and
as
they
grew
up
he
gave
them
all
the
advantages
which
it
was
possible
for
them
to
have
adèle
went
for
a
year
to
the
convent
of
the
sacre
cœur
in
the
city
and
could
play
tunes
on
the
piano
when
she
came
back
so
that
she
had
to
have
a
piano
of
her
own
which
was
the
first
one
ever
heard
in
viger
she
was
a
slight
angular
girl
with
a
dark
thin
face
and
black
hair
and
eyes
she
looked
like
her
father
and
took
after
him
in
many
ways
charles
the
elder
son
was
like
his
grandfather
tall
and
muscular
with
a
fine
head
and
a
handsome
face
he
was
studious
and
read
a
great
deal
and
was
always
talking
to
the
curé
about
studying
the
law
philippe
did
not
care
about
books
his
father
could
never
keep
him
at
school
he
was
short
and
and
had
merry
eyes
set
deep
in
his
head
some
one
must
learn
to
look
after
things
he
said
and
when
his
father
died
he
took
sole
charge
of
everything
if
the
desjardins
were
unsociable
with
others
they
were
happy
among
themselves
almost
every
evening
during
the
winter
when
the
work
was
done
they
would
light
up
the
front
room
with
candles
and
adèle
would
play
on
the
piano
and
sing
charles
would
pace
to
and
fro
behind
her
and
philippe
would
thrust
his
feet
far
under
the
stove
that
projected
from
the
next
room
through
the
partition
and
fall
fast
asleep
her
songs
were
mostly
old
french
songs
and
she
could
sing
partant
pour
la
syrie
and
la
this
last
was
a
favorite
with
charles
he
could
not
sing
himself
but
he
accompanied
the
music
by
making
wild
movements
with
his
arms
tramping
heavily
up
and
down
before
the
piano
and
shouting
out
so
loudly
as
to
wake
philippe
aux
armes
citoyens
on
fine
summer
evenings
philippe
and
adèle
would
walk
up
and
down
the
road
watching
the
marsh
and
pausing
on
the
bridge
to
hear
the
fish
jump
in
the
pool
and
the
deep
vibrant
croak
of
the
distant
frogs
it
was
not
always
philippe
who
walked
there
with
adèle
he
sometimes
sat
on
the
veranda
and
watched
her
walk
with
some
one
else
he
would
have
waking
dreams
as
he
smoked
that
the
two
figures
moving
before
him
were
himself
and
some
one
into
whose
eyes
he
was
looking
at
last
it
came
to
be
reality
for
him
and
then
he
could
not
sit
quietly
and
watch
the
lovers
he
would
let
his
pipe
go
out
and
stride
impatiently
up
and
down
the
veranda
and
on
sunday
afternoons
he
would
harness
his
horse
dress
himself
carefully
and
drive
off
with
short
laughs
and
twinklings
of
the
eyes
and
wavings
of
the
hands
they
were
evidently
planning
the
future
and
it
seemed
a
distance
of
vague
happiness
charles
kept
on
his
wonted
way
if
they
talked
in
the
parlor
they
could
hear
him
stirring
upstairs
if
they
strolled
in
the
road
they
could
see
his
light
in
the
window
philippe
humored
his
studious
habits
he
only
worked
in
the
mornings
in
the
afternoons
he
read
history
principally
his
favorite
study
was
the
life
of
napoleon
buonaparte
which
seemed
to
absorb
him
completely
he
was
growing
more
retired
and
preoccupied
every
day
in
deep
reveries
swallowed
of
ambitious
dreams
it
had
been
a
somewhat
longer
day
than
usual
in
the
and
it
was
late
when
the
last
meal
was
ready
philippe
as
he
called
charles
from
the
foot
of
the
stair
could
hear
him
walking
up
and
down
seemingly
reading
out
loud
and
when
he
received
no
response
to
his
demand
he
went
up
the
stairs
pushing
open
the
door
he
saw
his
brother
striding
up
and
down
the
room
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
and
his
head
bent
muttering
to
himself
charles
he
seemed
to
collect
himself
and
looked
up
come
down
to
supper
they
went
downstairs
together
adèle
and
philippe
kept
up
a
conversation
throughout
the
meal
but
charles
hardly
spoke
suddenly
he
pushed
his
plate
away
and
stood
upright
to
his
full
height
a
look
of
calm
severe
dignity
came
over
his
face
i
said
he
i
am
the
great
napoleon
charles
cried
adèle
what
is
the
matter
the
prosperity
of
the
nation
depends
upon
the
execution
of
my
plans
go
said
he
dismissing
some
imaginary
person
with
an
imperious
gesture
they
sat
as
if
stunned
and
between
them
stood
this
majestic
figure
with
outstretched
hand
then
charles
turned
away
and
commenced
to
pace
the
room
it
has
come
sobbed
adèle
as
she
sank
on
her
knees
beside
the
table
there
is
only
one
thing
to
do
said
philippe
after
some
hours
of
silence
it
is
hard
but
there
is
only
one
thing
to
the
room
was
perfectly
dark
he
stood
in
the
window
where
he
had
seen
the
light
die
out
of
the
sky
and
now
in
the
marshy
field
he
saw
the
fireflies
gleam
he
knew
that
adèle
was
in
the
dark
somewhere
beside
him
for
he
could
hear
her
breathe
we
must
cut
ourselves
off
we
must
be
the
last
of
our
in
those
words
which
in
after
years
were
often
on
his
lips
he
seemed
to
find
some
comfort
and
he
continued
to
repeat
them
to
himself
charles
lay
in
bed
in
a
sort
of
stupor
for
three
days
on
sunday
morning
he
rose
the
church
bells
were
ringing
he
met
philippe
in
the
hall
is
this
sunday
he
asked
come
here
they
went
into
the
front
room
this
is
sunday
you
say
the
last
thing
i
remember
was
you
telling
me
to
go
was
wednesday
what
has
happened
philippe
dropped
his
head
in
his
hands
tell
me
philippe
what
has
happened
i
can
not
i
must
know
philippe
where
have
i
been
on
wednesday
night
said
he
as
if
the
words
were
choking
him
you
said
i
am
the
great
napoleon
then
you
said
something
about
the
nation
and
you
have
not
spoken
charles
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
the
table
against
which
philippe
was
leaning
he
hid
his
face
in
his
arms
philippe
reaching
across
thrust
his
fingers
into
his
brother
s
brown
hair
the
warm
grasp
came
as
an
answer
to
all
charles
s
unasked
questions
he
knew
that
whatever
might
happen
his
brother
would
guard
him
for
a
month
or
two
he
lay
wavering
between
two
worlds
but
when
he
saw
the
first
snow
and
lost
sight
of
the
brown
earth
he
at
once
commenced
to
order
supplies
to
write
despatches
and
to
make
preparations
for
the
gigantic
expedition
which
was
to
end
in
the
overthrow
of
the
emperor
of
all
the
russias
and
the
snow
continues
to
bring
him
this
activity
during
the
summer
he
is
engaged
with
no
very
definite
operations
in
the
field
but
when
winter
comes
he
always
prepares
for
the
invasion
of
russia
with
the
exception
of
certain
days
of
dejection
and
trouble
which
adèle
calls
the
waterloo
days
in
the
summer
he
is
triumphant
with
perpetual
victory
on
a
little
bare
hill
about
a
mile
from
the
house
from
which
you
can
get
an
extensive
view
of
the
sloping
country
he
watches
the
movements
of
the
enemy
the
blasts
at
the
distant
quarries
sound
in
his
ears
like
the
roar
of
guns
beside
him
the
old
gray
horse
that
philippe
has
set
apart
for
his
service
crops
the
grass
or
stands
for
hours
patiently
down
in
the
shallow
valley
the
blanche
runs
glistening
the
mowers
sway
and
bend
on
the
horizon
shafts
of
smoke
rise
little
clouds
break
away
from
the
masses
and
drop
their
quiet
shadows
on
the
fields
and
through
his
glass
charles
watches
the
moving
shadows
the
shafts
of
smoke
and
the
swaying
mowers
watches
the
distant
hills
fringed
with
he
despatches
his
with
important
orders
or
rides
down
the
slope
to
oversee
the
fording
of
the
blanche
village
boys
hide
in
the
long
grass
to
hear
him
go
muttering
by
in
the
autumn
he
comes
sadly
up
out
of
the
valley
leading
his
horse
the
rein
through
his
arm
and
his
hands
in
his
the
sleet
dashes
against
him
and
the
wind
rushes
and
screams
around
him
as
he
ascends
the
little
knoll
but
whatever
the
weather
philippe
waits
in
the
road
for
him
and
helps
him
dismount
there
is
something
heroic
in
his
short
figure
sire
my
brother
he
says
sire
let
us
go
in
is
the
king
of
rome
better
and
the
empress
she
is
only
once
has
a
gleam
of
light
pierced
these
mists
it
was
in
the
year
when
as
adèle
said
he
had
had
two
waterloos
and
had
taken
to
his
bed
in
consequence
one
evening
adèle
brought
him
a
bowl
of
gruel
he
stared
like
a
child
awakened
from
sleep
when
she
carried
in
the
lamp
she
approached
the
bed
and
he
started
up
adèle
he
said
hoarsely
and
pulling
her
face
down
kissed
her
lips
for
a
moment
she
had
hope
but
with
the
next
week
came
winter
and
he
commenced
his
annual
preparations
for
the
invasion
of
russia
the
wooing
of
monsieur
cuerrier
it
had
been
one
of
those
days
that
go
astray
in
the
year
and
carry
the
genius
of
their
own
month
into
the
alien
ground
of
another
this
one
had
mistaken
the
last
month
of
spring
for
the
last
month
of
summer
and
had
lighted
a
may
day
with
an
august
sun
the
tender
foliage
of
the
trees
threw
almost
transparent
shadows
and
the
leaves
seemed
to
burn
with
a
green
liquid
fire
in
the
windless
air
toward
noon
the
damp
fields
commenced
to
exhale
a
moist
haze
that
spread
across
the
woods
growing
things
seemed
to
shrink
from
this
heavy
burden
of
sun
and
if
one
could
have
forgotten
that
there
were
yet
trilliums
in
the
woods
he
might
have
expected
summer
sounds
on
the
summer
air
after
the
sun
had
set
the
atmosphere
hung
dense
falling
into
darkness
without
a
movement
and
when
night
had
come
the
sultry
air
was
broken
by
flashes
of
pale
light
that
played
fitfully
and
without
direction
people
sat
on
their
for
air
or
paced
the
walks
languidly
it
was
not
a
usual
thing
for
monsieur
cuerrier
to
go
out
after
nightfall
his
shop
was
a
general
rendezvous
and
the
news
and
the
gossip
of
the
neighborhood
came
to
him
without
his
search
but
something
had
been
troubling
him
all
day
and
at
last
when
his
evening
mail
was
closed
he
put
on
his
boots
and
went
out
he
sauntered
down
the
street
in
his
shirt
sleeves
with
his
fingers
in
his
vest
pockets
his
face
did
not
lose
its
gravity
until
he
had
seated
himself
opposite
his
friend
alexis
girouard
and
put
a
pipe
between
his
teeth
then
he
looked
over
the
candle
which
stood
between
them
and
something
gleamed
in
his
eye
he
nursed
his
elbow
and
surveyed
his
friend
alexis
girouard
was
a
small
man
with
brown
his
face
was
so
round
and
the
movements
of
his
person
so
rapid
that
he
looked
like
a
squirrel
whose
cheeks
are
distended
with
nuts
by
occupation
he
was
a
buyer
of
butter
and
eggs
and
went
about
the
country
in
a
calash
driving
his
bargains
this
shrewd
fellow
whom
no
one
could
get
the
better
of
at
trade
was
ruled
by
his
maiden
sister
with
a
rod
of
iron
he
even
enjoyed
the
friendship
of
cuerrier
by
sufferance
their
interviews
were
carried
on
almost
clandestinely
with
the
figure
of
the
terrible
diana
always
imminent
when
a
sufficient
cloud
of
smoke
was
spread
around
the
room
cuerrier
asked
where
is
she
alexis
darted
a
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
village
removing
his
pipe
and
pointing
to
the
same
quarter
then
he
heaved
a
relieved
sigh
and
commenced
smoking
again
so
you
are
sure
she
s
out
said
cuerrier
alexis
looked
uneasy
no
he
answered
i
can
t
be
sure
she
s
cuerrier
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
alexis
stepped
to
the
door
and
listened
when
he
came
back
and
sat
down
cuerrier
said
without
looking
at
him
look
here
alexis
i
m
going
to
get
his
companion
started
so
that
he
knocked
some
of
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
then
with
a
nervous
jump
he
snatched
the
candle
and
went
into
the
kitchen
cuerrier
left
in
the
dark
shook
with
silent
laughter
alexis
came
back
after
making
sure
that
diana
was
not
there
and
before
seating
himself
he
held
the
candle
close
to
his
friend
s
face
and
surveyed
him
shrewdly
so
are
you
not
mad
no
i
m
not
alexis
sat
down
very
much
troubled
in
mind
you
see
i
m
not
young
and
the
mother
is
getting
now
last
week
she
fell
down
into
the
well
your
getting
married
won
t
prevent
her
falling
into
the
it
is
not
that
so
much
alexis
my
good
friend
but
if
you
had
no
one
to
look
after
here
alexis
you
would
perhaps
think
of
it
but
you
are
old
cuerrier
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
traced
in
the
air
what
to
alexis
s
eyes
looked
like
the
figure
fifty
cuerrier
offered
him
the
candle
there
is
not
a
gray
hair
in
my
girouard
took
the
light
and
glanced
down
on
his
friend
s
shock
of
brown
hair
so
finely
disordered
he
sat
down
satisfied
to
whom
me
what
charming
girl
is
to
be
the
postmistress
of
viger
is
it
the
madame
laroque
cuerrier
broke
again
into
one
of
his
valiant
laughs
guess
again
he
cried
you
are
near
it
you
ll
burn
yourself
next
not
the
second
césarine
angers
cuerrier
grown
more
sober
had
made
various
signs
of
acquiescence
and
what
will
your
friend
the
widow
say
see
here
alexis
she
he
was
going
to
say
something
she
s
one
of
the
bah
who
s
afraid
of
her
if
you
had
diana
to
deal
with
well
alexis
my
good
friend
that
is
it
could
you
not
drop
a
little
hint
to
the
widow
some
time
something
like
he
was
silent
something
like
a
dumb
man
eh
paufh
i
have
no
way
with
the
women
you
will
make
a
little
hint
to
the
just
then
there
was
a
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
walk
alexis
promptly
blew
out
the
candle
grasped
his
friend
by
the
arm
and
hurried
him
through
the
dark
to
the
door
there
he
thrust
his
hat
into
his
hand
and
saying
in
his
ear
luck
bolted
the
door
after
him
the
night
had
changed
its
mood
a
gentle
breeze
laden
with
soft
moisture
blew
from
the
dark
woods
the
mist
was
piled
in
a
gray
mass
along
the
horizon
and
in
spaces
of
sky
as
delicately
blue
as
blanched
violets
small
stars
flashed
clearly
cuerrier
pursed
up
his
lips
and
whistled
the
only
tune
he
knew
one
from
la
fille
de
madame
he
was
uneasy
too
uneasy
to
follow
the
intricacies
of
his
tune
and
he
stopped
whistling
he
had
told
his
friend
that
he
was
going
to
marry
and
had
mentioned
the
lady
s
name
but
what
right
had
he
to
do
that
old
fool
he
said
to
himself
he
remembered
his
feuds
with
his
love
s
guardian
some
of
them
of
years
standing
he
thought
of
his
age
he
ran
through
the
years
he
might
expect
to
live
and
ended
by
calculating
how
much
he
was
worth
valuing
his
three
farms
in
an
instant
he
felt
proud
after
that
and
césarine
angers
did
not
seem
quite
so
far
off
he
resolved
just
before
sleep
caught
him
to
open
the
campaign
at
once
with
the
help
of
alexis
girouard
but
in
the
dream
that
followed
he
found
himself
successfully
wooing
the
widow
wooing
her
with
sneers
and
gibes
and
rehearsals
of
the
old
quarrels
that
seemed
to
draw
her
smilingly
toward
him
as
if
there
was
some
malign
influence
at
work
translating
his
words
into
irresistible
phrases
of
endearment
monsieur
cuerrier
commenced
to
wear
a
gallant
blue
waistcoat
all
dotted
with
white
spots
and
a
silk
necktie
with
fringed
ends
you
see
i
am
in
the
fashion
now
he
explained
to
his
friends
villeblanc
the
superannuated
hairdresser
eyed
him
critically
and
commenced
to
suspect
him
he
blew
a
whistle
of
gratification
when
one
evening
in
he
saw
the
shy
cuerrier
drop
a
rose
full
blown
at
the
feet
of
césarine
angers
his
gratification
was
not
unmixed
when
he
saw
césarine
pick
it
up
and
carry
it
away
blushing
delicately
cuerrier
tried
to
whistle
la
fille
de
madame
angot
but
his
heart
leaped
into
his
throat
and
his
lips
curled
into
a
nervous
smile
said
villeblanc
i
think
i
ll
curl
my
gentleman
s
wig
for
he
was
not
unheedful
of
the
beauty
of
césarine
he
spoke
a
word
of
enigmatical
warning
to
the
widow
you
had
better
put
off
your
weeds
are
we
not
going
to
have
a
wedding
this
seed
fell
upon
ready
ground
and
bore
an
unexpected
shoot
from
that
day
the
widow
wore
her
best
cap
on
week
days
then
along
came
the
good
friend
alexis
girouard
with
his
little
hint
my
friend
cuerrier
wants
to
get
married
he
s
as
shy
as
a
bird
but
don
t
be
hard
on
the
plant
blossomed
at
once
the
widow
shook
her
finger
at
her
image
in
the
glass
took
on
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
and
dusted
off
a
guitar
of
her
youth
cuerrier
came
in
the
evenings
and
sat
awhile
with
the
widow
and
that
discreet
second
cousin
hiding
her
withered
rose
sometimes
also
with
a
stunted
farmer
from
near
viger
who
wore
and
smelt
of
native
tobacco
and
oiled
leather
this
farmer
was
designed
by
the
widow
for
that
rebel
césarine
who
still
resisted
behind
her
barricade
now
strengthened
by
secret
supplies
of
roses
from
an
official
of
the
government
itself
but
it
is
high
time
to
speak
thought
cuerrier
and
one
night
when
there
was
not
a
hint
of
native
tobacco
in
the
air
he
said
madame
laroque
i
am
thinking
now
of
what
i
would
like
to
happen
to
me
before
i
grow
an
old
man
and
i
think
to
be
married
would
be
a
good
thing
if
you
make
no
objection
i
would
marry
the
beautiful
césarine
the
widow
gathered
her
bitter
fruit
old
beast
she
cried
stamping
on
the
guitar
old
enough
to
be
her
she
drove
the
bewildered
postmaster
out
of
the
house
and
locked
césarine
into
her
room
she
let
her
come
down
to
work
but
watched
her
like
a
cat
forty
times
a
day
she
cried
out
the
old
scoundrel
and
sometimes
she
would
break
a
silence
with
a
laugh
of
high
mockery
that
ended
with
the
phrase
the
idea
that
was
like
the
knot
to
a
she
even
derided
cuerrier
from
her
chamber
window
if
he
dared
to
walk
the
street
the
postmaster
bore
it
he
pursed
up
his
lips
to
whistle
and
said
he
also
went
to
see
his
friend
alexis
i
have
a
plan
alexis
he
said
if
diana
were
only
out
of
the
but
diana
was
in
the
road
she
was
in
league
with
the
widow
fancy
she
cried
fiercely
what
is
to
become
of
us
when
old
men
behave
so
why
the
next
thing
i
know
will
want
to
get
whatever
cuerrier
s
plan
was
he
got
no
chance
to
impart
it
diana
was
always
in
the
road
and
reported
everything
to
the
widow
she
in
turn
watched
césarine
but
one
night
when
alexis
was
supposed
to
be
away
he
appeared
suddenly
in
cuerrier
s
presence
he
had
come
back
unexpectedly
and
had
not
gone
home
first
the
plan
was
imparted
to
him
but
to
bring
the
calash
out
of
the
yard
at
twelve
at
night
without
diana
hearing
has
ears
like
a
but
he
pledged
himself
to
try
the
widow
saw
him
depart
and
she
and
diana
expected
a
d
madame
laroque
turned
the
key
on
césarine
and
fed
her
on
bread
and
water
diana
locked
her
brother
s
door
every
night
when
she
knew
he
was
in
bed
much
to
alexis
s
perplexity
the
lane
that
separated
the
widow
s
house
from
cuerrier
s
was
just
nine
feet
wide
the
postmaster
had
reason
to
know
that
madame
laroque
had
fought
him
for
years
saying
that
he
had
built
on
her
land
at
last
they
had
got
a
surveyor
from
the
city
who
measured
it
with
his
chain
the
widow
flew
at
him
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
almighty
made
this
nine
feet
he
said
you
can
not
turn
the
world
upside
nine
feet
said
cuerrier
to
himself
nine
feet
and
two
are
with
that
length
in
his
head
he
walked
over
to
the
carpenter
s
that
evening
he
contemplated
a
plank
eleven
feet
long
in
his
kitchen
the
same
evening
alexis
was
deep
in
dissimulation
he
was
holding
up
an
image
of
garrulous
innocence
to
diana
who
glared
at
it
suspiciously
the
postmaster
bored
a
small
hole
through
the
plank
about
two
inches
from
one
end
through
this
he
ran
the
end
of
a
long
rope
and
knotted
it
firmly
then
he
carried
the
plank
upstairs
into
a
small
room
over
the
store
opposite
the
window
of
this
room
there
was
a
window
in
madame
laroque
s
house
sweet
dreams
cried
alexis
to
diana
as
cold
with
excitement
he
staggered
upstairs
he
made
all
the
movements
of
undressing
but
he
did
not
undress
then
he
gradually
quieted
down
and
sat
shivering
near
the
window
in
a
short
time
diana
crept
up
and
locked
his
door
it
took
him
an
hour
to
gain
courage
enough
to
throw
his
boots
out
of
the
window
he
followed
them
slipping
down
the
post
of
the
veranda
he
crept
cautiously
into
the
stable
his
horse
was
ready
harnessed
and
he
led
her
out
quaking
lest
she
should
whinny
the
calash
was
farther
back
in
the
yard
than
usual
to
drive
out
he
would
have
to
pass
diana
s
window
just
as
he
took
the
reins
in
his
hand
the
horse
gave
a
loud
fretful
neigh
he
struck
her
with
the
whip
but
she
would
not
stir
he
struck
her
again
and
as
she
bounded
past
the
window
it
was
raised
and
something
white
appeared
alexis
glancing
over
his
shoulder
gave
a
hoarse
shout
to
relieve
his
excitement
he
had
seen
the
head
of
the
chaste
diana
cuerrier
let
down
the
top
about
two
inches
then
he
raised
the
lower
sash
almost
to
its
full
height
and
passed
the
end
of
the
rope
from
the
outside
through
the
upper
aperture
into
the
room
and
tied
it
to
a
nail
then
he
pushed
the
plank
out
of
the
window
and
let
it
drop
until
it
swung
by
the
rope
then
he
lifted
it
up
hand
over
hand
till
the
end
rested
on
the
sill
adjusting
it
so
as
to
leave
a
good
four
inches
to
rest
on
the
opposite
ledge
he
lowered
away
his
rope
until
the
end
of
the
plank
reached
the
opposite
side
and
there
was
a
strong
bridge
from
madame
laroque
s
house
to
his
own
he
took
a
stout
pole
and
tapped
gently
on
the
window
césarine
was
stretched
on
her
bed
sleeping
lightly
the
tapping
woke
her
she
rose
on
her
elbow
the
sound
came
again
she
went
to
the
window
and
raised
a
corner
of
the
curtain
cuerrier
flashed
his
lantern
across
the
glass
césarine
put
up
the
window
quietly
she
heard
cuerrier
calling
her
assuringly
she
crept
out
on
the
plank
and
put
the
window
down
then
she
stood
up
and
aided
by
the
stout
pole
which
the
postmaster
held
firmly
she
was
soon
across
the
abyss
the
plank
was
pulled
in
the
window
shut
down
and
all
trace
of
the
exploit
had
vanished
at
sunrise
pausing
after
the
ascent
of
a
hill
they
looked
back
and
césarine
thought
she
saw
like
a
little
silver
point
in
the
rosy
light
the
steeple
of
the
far
joseph
s
and
below
them
from
a
hollow
filled
with
mist
concealing
the
houses
rose
the
tower
and
dome
of
the
parish
church
of
valérie
a
week
after
when
the
farmer
from
near
viger
came
into
the
for
his
mail
bearing
the
familiar
odor
of
native
tobacco
the
new
postmistress
of
viger
setting
the
tips
of
her
fingers
on
the
counter
and
leaning
on
her
pretty
wrists
until
four
dimples
appeared
on
the
back
of
each
of
her
hands
said
i
have
nothing
for
the
rage
of
madame
laroque
was
less
than
her
curiosity
to
know
how
césarine
had
effected
her
escape
she
made
friends
with
her
and
wore
a
cheerful
face
but
césarine
was
silent
tell
her
birds
fly
said
cuerrier
exasperated
at
last
the
widow
commenced
a
petty
revenge
she
cooked
a
favorite
dinner
of
cuerrier
s
and
left
her
kitchen
windows
open
to
fill
his
house
with
the
odor
but
early
that
morning
the
postmaster
had
gone
off
to
valérie
to
draw
up
a
lease
and
had
taken
his
wife
with
him
about
noon
he
had
stopped
to
water
his
horse
and
had
climbed
out
of
his
calash
to
pluck
some
asters
césarine
decked
her
hat
with
them
and
sang
a
light
had
learned
the
air
from
la
fille
de
madame
sedan
one
of
the
pleasantest
streets
in
viger
was
that
which
led
from
the
thoroughfare
of
the
village
to
the
common
it
was
a
little
street
with
little
houses
but
it
looked
as
if
only
happy
people
lived
there
the
enormous
old
willows
which
shaded
it
through
its
whole
length
made
a
perpetual
shimmer
of
shadow
and
sun
and
towered
so
above
the
low
cottages
that
they
seemed
to
have
crept
under
the
guardian
trees
to
rest
and
doze
a
while
there
was
something
idyllic
about
this
contented
spot
it
seemed
to
be
removed
from
the
rest
of
the
village
to
be
on
the
boundaries
of
arcadia
the
first
inlet
to
its
pleasant
dreamy
fields
in
the
spring
the
boys
made
a
veritable
arcadia
of
it
coming
there
in
bands
cutting
the
willows
for
whistles
and
entering
into
a
blithe
contest
for
supremacy
in
making
them
accompanying
their
labors
by
a
perpetual
sounding
of
their
pleasant
pipes
as
if
a
colony
of
uncommon
birds
had
taken
up
their
homes
in
the
trees
even
in
the
winter
there
was
something
pleasant
about
it
the
immense
boles
of
the
willows
presiding
over
the
collection
of
houses
seemed
to
protect
them
and
the
sunshine
had
always
a
suggestion
of
warmth
as
it
dwelt
in
the
long
branches
it
was
on
this
street
just
a
little
distance
from
the
corner
that
paul
arbique
kept
his
inn
which
was
famous
in
its
way
he
called
it
the
turenne
after
the
renowned
commander
of
that
name
for
they
had
the
same
birthplace
and
arbique
himself
had
been
a
soldier
as
his
medals
would
testify
the
location
was
favorable
for
such
a
house
as
arbique
was
prepared
to
keep
and
in
choosing
it
he
appealed
to
a
crotchet
in
man
which
makes
it
pleasanter
for
him
to
go
around
the
corner
for
anything
he
may
require
a
pleasant
place
it
was
particularly
in
summer
the
very
exterior
had
an
air
about
it
the
green
blinds
and
the
green
slatted
door
and
the
shadows
from
the
playing
over
the
legend
fresh
buttermilk
a
sign
dear
to
the
lover
of
simple
pleasures
from
all
the
appearances
one
would
have
supposed
that
the
turenne
was
a
complete
success
and
every
one
thought
arbique
was
romancing
when
he
said
he
was
just
getting
along
and
that
was
all
but
so
far
as
he
knew
he
spoke
the
truth
for
his
wife
managed
everything
including
himself
there
was
only
one
thing
she
could
not
do
she
could
not
make
him
stop
drinking
brandy
the
arbiques
considered
themselves
very
much
superior
to
the
village
people
because
they
had
come
from
old
france
i
am
a
frenchman
paul
would
say
when
he
had
had
too
much
brandy
but
no
one
would
take
offence
at
him
he
was
too
good
a
fellow
when
he
had
had
a
modicum
of
his
favorite
liquor
he
talked
of
his
birthplace
sedan
the
dearest
spot
on
earth
to
him
and
his
crimean
experiences
and
when
he
had
reached
a
stage
beyond
that
he
talked
of
his
wife
it
was
a
pathetic
sight
to
see
him
at
such
times
as
he
leaned
close
to
his
auditor
and
explained
to
him
how
superior
a
woman
felice
was
and
what
a
cruel
inexplicable
mistake
she
had
made
in
marrying
him
and
how
all
his
efforts
to
make
her
happy
had
failed
not
through
any
fault
of
her
own
but
because
it
was
impossible
that
he
could
ever
make
her
happy
thus
taking
all
the
blame
of
their
domestic
infelicity
upon
his
own
shoulders
with
the
simple
idea
that
it
must
be
his
own
fault
when
no
fault
of
any
kind
could
possibly
rest
with
felice
he
was
a
tall
fellow
with
a
military
air
and
despite
his
fifty
years
and
the
extent
of
his
potations
there
was
yet
a
brave
flourish
in
his
manner
he
was
seen
at
his
best
on
sunday
when
clothed
in
a
complete
suit
of
black
with
a
single
carnation
in
his
buttonhole
and
with
an
irreproachable
silk
hat
he
promenaded
with
madame
arbique
on
his
arm
madame
on
such
occasions
was
as
fine
as
her
lord
and
held
her
silk
gown
far
above
the
defilement
of
the
street
in
order
to
show
her
embroidered
petticoat
and
a
pair
of
pretty
feet
but
no
matter
how
finely
she
was
dressed
she
always
wore
an
expression
of
discontent
she
had
the
instincts
of
a
miser
but
she
also
had
enough
good
sense
not
to
let
them
interfere
with
the
sources
of
profit
and
so
although
she
was
as
keen
to
save
a
cent
as
any
one
could
have
been
the
turenne
showed
no
sign
of
it
the
provision
for
the
entertainment
of
guests
was
ample
and
sufficient
felice
had
always
had
her
own
way
and
owing
to
paul
s
incapacity
which
had
overtaken
him
gradually
the
affairs
of
the
house
had
been
left
in
her
hands
they
had
only
had
one
child
who
had
died
when
she
was
a
baby
and
this
want
of
children
was
a
great
trial
to
paul
they
had
attempted
to
fill
her
place
by
adopting
a
little
girl
but
the
experiment
had
not
been
a
success
and
she
grew
to
be
something
between
a
servant
and
a
poor
relation
working
for
her
board
this
was
owing
to
no
fault
of
paul
s
who
would
have
prevented
it
if
he
could
but
his
wife
had
taken
a
dislike
to
the
child
and
she
simply
neglected
her
latulipe
for
in
the
family
she
was
called
by
no
other
name
was
a
strange
girl
she
had
been
frightened
and
subdued
by
madame
arbique
and
at
times
she
would
scarcely
speak
a
word
and
then
again
she
would
talk
boldly
and
defiantly
as
if
she
were
protesting
no
matter
how
insignificant
her
remarks
might
be
her
personal
appearance
was
as
odd
as
her
manner
she
had
an
abundance
of
hair
of
a
light
pleasant
shade
of
red
her
complexion
was
a
clear
white
her
lips
were
intensely
crimson
her
dark
eyes
were
small
but
quick
and
very
clear
her
manner
was
shy
and
rather
awkward
her
one
claim
to
distinction
was
that
she
had
some
influence
over
arbique
whom
she
could
now
and
then
prevent
drinking
he
was
sorry
for
her
and
ashamed
of
the
position
she
occupied
in
the
house
which
was
so
different
from
what
he
had
intended
when
the
war
broke
out
and
for
months
before
the
turenne
was
the
rendezvous
for
those
of
the
villagers
who
had
any
desire
to
discuss
the
situation
arbique
was
the
oracle
of
this
group
and
night
after
night
he
held
forth
on
the
political
situation
on
the
art
of
war
and
his
personal
experiences
in
the
army
there
was
only
one
habitué
of
the
turenne
who
was
silent
on
these
occasions
that
was
hans
blumenthal
the
german
watchmaker
he
had
had
his
corner
in
the
ever
since
he
had
come
to
viger
and
was
one
of
arbique
s
best
customers
but
when
the
war
excitement
broke
out
arbique
expected
to
see
no
more
of
him
the
warmth
of
the
discussions
and
the
violence
of
the
treatment
his
nation
received
nightly
would
have
been
expected
to
drive
him
away
but
instead
he
returned
again
and
again
to
his
place
at
the
little
table
by
the
window
peering
through
his
glasses
with
his
imperturbable
expression
not
seeming
to
heed
the
wordy
storms
that
beset
his
ears
arbique
when
hostilities
had
actually
broken
out
pasted
a
map
of
the
seat
of
war
upon
the
wall
above
this
he
placed
a
colored
picture
of
a
french
chasseur
and
scrawled
below
it
the
words
berlin
even
this
did
not
disturb
the
german
he
took
advantage
of
the
map
and
as
arbique
had
set
pins
to
which
were
attached
red
and
blue
pieces
of
wool
to
show
the
positions
of
the
armies
he
even
studied
the
locations
and
movements
with
interest
he
read
his
paper
gave
his
orders
paid
his
score
came
and
went
as
he
had
always
done
this
made
paul
very
angry
and
he
would
have
turned
him
out
of
the
house
if
he
had
not
remembered
that
he
was
his
guest
and
his
sense
of
honor
would
not
permit
it
he
was
drinking
very
heavily
and
wanted
to
fight
some
one
but
every
one
agreed
with
him
except
the
german
and
he
kept
silence
he
had
serious
thoughts
of
challenging
him
to
a
duel
if
the
opportunity
offered
latulipe
was
the
only
one
who
stood
up
for
hans
she
had
been
accustomed
to
wait
on
the
guests
sometimes
when
arbique
was
incapacitated
and
his
gentle
manner
had
won
her
regard
one
day
she
turned
on
paul
who
was
abusing
hans
behind
his
back
and
gave
him
a
piece
of
her
mind
she
was
so
sudden
and
sharp
with
it
that
she
sobered
him
a
little
and
in
thinking
it
over
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
if
he
could
help
it
she
would
see
the
german
no
more
hans
noticed
her
absence
and
said
to
paul
one
night
when
he
was
ordering
his
beer
where
is
mademoiselle
latulipe
by
the
way
he
said
it
in
his
odd
french
any
one
could
have
told
what
he
thought
of
latulipe
mademoiselle
latulipe
said
arbique
with
a
dramatic
flourish
is
my
so
hans
saw
her
no
more
in
the
evening
he
had
other
trials
besides
this
once
in
a
while
the
lads
in
the
street
hooted
after
him
and
this
sort
of
attention
became
more
frequent
one
evening
after
the
news
of
woerth
had
been
received
some
one
threw
a
stone
through
the
window
of
his
shop
that
very
night
he
stood
before
the
map
with
his
hands
behind
him
peering
into
it
as
he
altered
the
pins
which
arbique
had
now
lost
all
interest
in
he
heard
some
one
mutter
he
thought
it
must
be
intended
for
him
but
he
drank
his
beer
quietly
and
went
home
rather
early
after
he
had
gone
some
of
his
enemies
becoming
valiant
with
liquor
made
a
compact
to
go
out
when
it
was
late
enough
break
into
his
house
and
give
him
a
sound
beating
but
latulipe
overheard
their
plan
from
the
stairway
and
as
soon
as
she
could
get
away
without
being
noticed
she
ran
over
to
the
watchmaker
s
shop
it
was
quite
late
and
there
was
not
a
soul
on
the
street
she
was
wondering
how
she
could
warn
him
but
when
she
reached
the
door
she
noticed
a
ladder
which
led
to
a
scaffold
running
along
below
the
windows
of
the
second
story
where
some
workmen
had
been
making
repairs
there
was
a
light
burning
in
one
of
the
second
story
windows
and
without
waiting
to
reflect
latulipe
ran
up
the
ladder
and
tapped
at
the
window
hans
opened
it
and
said
something
in
german
when
he
saw
who
it
was
latulipe
did
not
wait
for
salutations
but
told
him
exactly
what
he
might
expect
when
that
was
over
she
tried
to
escape
as
she
had
come
but
the
darkness
below
frightened
her
and
she
could
not
go
down
the
ladder
hans
tried
to
coax
her
to
come
in
at
the
window
and
go
out
by
the
street
door
but
she
would
not
hear
to
that
she
leaned
against
the
house
shrinking
away
from
the
edge
so
hans
got
out
upon
the
scaffolding
mademoiselle
latulipe
he
said
in
his
rough
french
you
need
not
be
alarmed
at
me
i
have
only
a
good
heart
toward
he
held
out
his
hand
but
latulipe
knew
by
the
sound
of
his
voice
that
he
was
going
to
make
love
to
her
and
before
he
could
say
another
word
she
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
when
the
bravos
came
to
give
hans
his
beating
he
confronted
them
with
a
lamp
in
one
hand
and
a
pistol
in
the
other
and
they
fell
over
one
another
in
their
haste
to
retreat
during
the
whole
of
the
month
of
august
arbique
had
been
wild
with
excitement
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
war
and
would
talk
of
nothing
else
at
first
he
would
not
believe
in
any
reverse
to
the
french
arms
it
was
lies
everything
was
lies
his
cry
was
berlin
but
although
he
could
manage
to
deceive
himself
by
this
false
enthusiasm
sometimes
the
truth
would
stab
straight
to
his
heart
like
a
knife
and
he
would
tremble
as
if
he
had
the
ague
for
the
honor
of
his
country
was
the
thing
dearest
to
him
in
all
the
world
if
he
could
only
have
died
for
her
but
there
day
after
day
he
saw
the
pins
on
the
map
moved
by
that
cold
german
close
around
metz
he
could
no
longer
cry
the
french
army
was
facing
paris
with
berlin
at
its
back
he
drank
fiercely
now
and
even
latulipe
could
do
nothing
with
him
madame
arbique
knew
that
he
would
drink
himself
to
death
as
his
father
had
done
he
would
sit
and
mutter
by
the
hour
thinking
all
the
time
of
what
revenge
he
could
have
on
blumenthal
who
had
become
to
his
eyes
the
incarnation
of
hated
prussia
but
so
long
as
hans
came
to
the
house
quietly
to
sit
at
his
table
and
drink
his
beer
arbique
would
not
say
an
uncivil
word
to
him
on
the
evening
of
the
of
august
there
was
an
unusual
crowd
at
the
turenne
and
a
group
had
surrounded
the
map
gesticulating
and
discussing
hans
had
finished
reading
his
paper
and
went
toward
them
they
parted
when
they
saw
him
coming
and
he
stood
peering
down
at
the
map
through
his
glasses
arbique
had
not
been
seen
all
evening
but
he
appeared
suddenly
looking
haggard
and
shattered
and
caught
sight
of
his
friends
grouped
round
the
german
he
went
slowly
toward
them
and
as
he
approached
he
heard
hans
say
there
there
they
must
fight
and
saw
him
put
his
finger
on
the
map
between
mézières
and
carignan
almost
over
sedan
paul
had
been
in
bed
all
day
and
had
not
had
anything
to
drink
and
when
he
saw
the
german
with
his
finger
on
sedan
he
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
he
broke
out
no
not
his
voice
trembling
with
rage
here
they
will
for
your
abominable
prussia
i
for
my
beautiful
he
fell
into
a
dramatic
attitude
drawing
two
pistols
from
his
pocket
he
presented
one
to
his
nearest
friend
to
hand
to
blumenthal
the
man
held
the
pistol
for
a
moment
but
hans
never
moved
madame
arbique
seeing
the
commotion
and
catching
sight
of
the
weapons
screamed
as
loud
as
she
could
and
latulipe
running
in
threw
herself
upon
arbique
he
turned
deadly
pale
and
had
to
use
the
girl
s
strength
to
keep
from
falling
hans
went
away
quietly
and
sat
down
near
the
window
arbique
was
fluttering
like
a
leaf
in
the
wind
and
latulipe
and
felice
half
carried
him
upstairs
the
men
left
in
the
room
shook
their
heads
the
next
evening
hans
was
walking
in
the
starlight
under
the
willows
with
his
dim
vision
he
saw
some
one
leaning
against
one
of
the
trees
but
when
he
passed
again
he
knew
it
was
latulipe
he
stopped
and
spoke
to
her
when
she
spoke
she
did
not
answer
his
question
oh
she
said
he
will
never
get
better
yes
said
hans
he
will
be
no
said
latulipe
i
know
by
the
way
he
looks
and
he
says
now
that
france
is
beaten
and
crushed
he
does
not
want
to
brave
soul
said
hans
and
when
he
goes
said
latulipe
what
is
to
become
of
me
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
arm
and
when
she
did
not
resist
he
took
her
hand
in
both
his
own
she
was
giving
herself
to
the
enemy
a
cloud
above
had
taken
the
starlight
and
in
the
willows
a
little
rain
fell
with
a
timorous
sound
latulipe
was
crying
softly
on
hans
s
shoulder
it
was
september
and
around
viger
the
harvest
was
nearly
finished
the
days
were
clear
as
glass
already
the
maples
were
stroked
with
fire
with
the
lustre
of
wine
and
gold
early
risers
felt
the
keener
air
the
sunsets
reddened
the
mists
which
lay
light
as
lawn
on
the
low
fields
but
paul
arbique
thought
and
spoke
of
sedan
alone
the
place
where
he
was
born
of
the
meuse
the
bridges
of
his
father
s
farm
just
without
the
walls
of
the
city
and
of
his
boyhood
and
the
friends
of
his
youth
his
thoughts
were
hardly
of
the
war
or
of
the
terror
of
the
downfall
which
had
a
little
while
before
so
haunted
him
it
was
the
evening
of
the
day
upon
which
the
news
of
the
battle
had
come
they
had
resolved
not
to
tell
him
but
there
was
something
in
latulipe
s
manner
which
disturbed
him
waking
from
a
light
doze
he
said
that
prussian
spy
what
did
he
say
must
fight
mézières
and
carignan
i
have
been
at
he
had
his
hound
s
paw
on
he
was
quiet
for
a
while
then
he
said
dreamily
latulipe
who
was
watching
with
him
wept
in
the
night
his
lips
moved
again
france
he
murmured
france
will
it
was
toward
the
morning
of
the
next
day
when
his
true
heart
failed
latulipe
had
just
opened
the
blinds
a
pale
light
came
through
the
willows
when
she
bent
over
him
she
caught
his
last
word
he
sighed
no
rue
alfred
de
musset
it
was
an
evening
early
in
may
the
maples
were
covered
with
their
little
like
the
crescents
of
the
moslem
hosts
they
hung
redly
in
the
evening
air
the
new
of
the
poplars
shone
out
like
silver
blooms
the
stood
with
their
virginal
branches
outlined
against
the
filmy
rose
and
gray
of
the
evening
sky
their
slender
leaves
half
open
everything
swam
in
the
hazy
light
the
air
was
full
of
gold
motes
in
the
sky
lay
a
few
strands
of
cloud
touched
with
almost
imperceptible
rose
at
the
upper
window
of
a
house
in
de
musset
street
maurice
ruelle
looked
down
upon
the
trees
covered
with
the
misty
light
his
window
was
high
above
everything
and
the
house
itself
stood
alone
on
the
brow
of
a
little
cliff
that
commanded
miles
of
broken
country
maurice
was
propped
up
at
the
window
and
had
a
shawl
thrown
about
his
shoulders
the
room
was
close
a
little
was
dying
away
in
the
open
stove
maurice
maurice
i
m
sick
of
life
i
will
be
an
maurice
turned
his
head
to
look
at
the
speaker
she
was
seated
on
the
floor
leaning
on
her
slanted
arm
which
was
thrown
behind
her
to
support
her
weight
well
my
dear
sister
you
are
don
t
be
bitter
i
m
not
bitter
i

you
are
ambitious
i

proud
of
you

see
why

cruel
to

but
i

only

had
money
enough
to
send
you
away
for
these
terrible
winters
or
give
you
a
room
in
some
fine
maurice
watched
the
birds
dropping
through
the
glow
a
little
maid
brought
in
candles
eloise
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
restlessly
ah
well
we
haven
t
the
money
maurice
sighed
s
not
altogether
a
matter
of
money
to
me
it
s
a
matter
of
well
to
me
it
s
hardly
a
matter
of
money
or
of
maurice
you
must
not
think
of
that
i
forbid
it
i
must
do
something
i
feel
that
i
can
succeed
look
at
me
me
she
stood
with
her
head
thrown
back
and
poised
lightly
and
with
a
little
frown
on
her
face
superb
said
her
brother
i
know
i
ll
do
something
desperate
she
said
i
must
live
i
was
made
yes
my
dear
that
is
the
difference
between
maurice
how
dare
you
i
forbid
it
i
have
decided
you
will
go
south
and
i
will
begin
to
live
i
am
going
to
stop
well
i
have
long
ago
ceased
to
wish
wishing
was
the
only
passion
i
ever
had
i
have
given
it
up
but
i
have
not
wished
for
money
sometimes
i
have
wished
for
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
he
only
thought
of
what
he
had
longed
for
more
than
anything
else
the
love
of
his
beautiful
impulsive
sister
eloise
was
dusting
her
geranium
leaves
maurice
looked
from
his
window
into
the
tree
on
which
the
leaves
were
not
yet
thick
enough
to
hide
the
old
nests
a
short
time
after
this
a
rather
curious
advertisement
appeared
in
one
of
the
city
papers
it
read
very
handsome
old
oak
furniture
secretaire
with
small
drawers
a
dower
chest
and
a
little
table
each
article
richly
carved
for
particulars
call
at
no
rue
alfred
de
musset
eloise
read
this
advertisement
to
her
brother
what
does
this
mean
he
asked
we
have
no
such
furniture
but
it
is
our
number
true
enough
is
this
the
commencement
yes
my
dear
that
is
what
it
the
next
day
callers
in
response
to
this
advertisement
began
to
arrive
eloise
answered
the
bell
herself
the
first
was
a
rather
shabby
old
man
who
wore
a
tall
hat
and
green
glasses
he
produced
a
crumpled
clipping
from
the
paper
and
smoothing
it
out
handed
it
to
eloise
i
have
come
to
buy
this
furniture
he
explained
holding
his
hat
by
the
brim
eloise
looked
at
the
advertisement
as
if
she
had
never
seen
it
before
there
must
be
some
mistake
she
said
i
have
no
such
i
have
not
mistaken
the
rue
alfred
de
yes
but
the
printer
must
have
made
a
mistake
this
is
not
the
many
times
that
day
she
had
to
give
unpromising
looking
people
the
same
answer
every
one
of
them
accepted
the
situation
cheerfully
certainly
it
must
have
been
a
mistake
three
letters
came
also
with
inquiries
about
the
furniture
one
of
these
eloise
was
tempted
to
answer
but
she
resolved
to
wait
a
day
or
two
the
next
day
no
one
came
at
all
but
on
the
next
about
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
a
young
man
drove
up
in
a
he
left
his
horse
and
walked
rapidly
through
the
little
garden
to
the
house
he
was
a
handsome
youth
he
rang
somewhat
violently
and
eloise
answered
the
summons
she
opened
the
door
a
foot
and
the
caller
could
only
see
a
bit
of
her
white
dress
i
have
called
to
see
the
furniture
you
have
advertised
he
said
the
door
opened
slowly
and
taking
this
as
an
invitation
to
enter
he
stepped
into
the
hall
he
could
not
tell
why
but
he
expected
to
see
an
old
woman
behind
the
door
instead
he
saw
a
very
graceful
girl
holding
the
between
her
fingers
without
a
word
she
preceded
him
with
an
air
of
shyness
and
led
the
way
into
the
front
room
he
glanced
about
for
the
furniture
it
was
evidently
not
there
she
asked
him
to
be
seated
my
father
wanted
me
to
come
out
and
look
at
the
things
you
advertised
he
said
you
are
very
good
not
at
all
my
father
picks
up
these
things
for
the
house
when
they
are
really
these
are
very
she
still
wore
an
air
of
shyness
and
looked
abstractedly
from
the
window
into
a
she
seemed
nervous
and
apprehensive
could
you
let
me
see
them
there
was
a
noise
upstairs
eloise
half
started
from
her
chair
i
beg
of
you
not
to
speak
so
he
relapsed
into
a
whisper
i
beg
pardon
i
was
not
conscious
of
speaking
too
it
is
not
that
can
not
she
ended
abruptly
you
see
she
said
hesitatingly
i
wish
you
had
come
have
you
promised
them
to
some
one
else
no
not
at
all
but
yesterday
it
might
have
been
possible
it
is
impossible
to
show
it
to
when
can
i
see
it
i
am
can
not
say
when
it
is
my
brother
it
must
be
an
expression
of
slight
distress
crossed
her
face
does
he
not
want
it
sold
monsieur
i
beg
of
you
not
to
question
me
i
am
in
great
she
continued
after
a
moment
s
pause
you
have
rarely
seen
things
so
exquisite
the
secretaire
has
a
secret
cabinet
the
chest
is
carved
with
a
scene
of
nymphs
in
a
wood
the
table
is
a
beautiful
little
she
figured
these
articles
in
the
air
with
an
imaginative
wave
of
her
hand
the
young
man
began
to
regard
her
with
some
interest
he
remarked
to
himself
that
she
was
a
lovely
girl
i
m
sorry
my
call
is
inopportune
i
will
come
he
left
his
card
on
the
table
perhaps
when
you
come
again
it
will
be
more
convenient
she
said
following
him
at
some
distance
to
the
door
he
opened
it
himself
and
went
down
the
steps
as
he
looked
back
it
was
slowly
shutting
and
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
delicate
white
dress
as
it
closed
eloise
took
up
the
card
the
name
was
pierre
pechito
she
knew
the
name
it
was
borne
by
one
of
the
richest
of
the
city
merchants
she
took
the
card
up
to
maurice
he
held
it
in
his
emaciated
fingers
is
this
the
end
of
chapter
one
he
asked
well
he
may
never
come
back
and
what
will
you
do
with
him
if
he
does
come
back
oh
he
will
come
as
for
the
rest
we
must
succeed
but
there
is
one
thing
maurice
you
must
be
the
invisible
ogre
you
must
rage
about
here
as
wildly
as
you
can
while
i
am
working
out
our
destiny
my
destiny
he
asked
with
a
falling
touch
of
sadness
in
his
accent
a
few
days
after
this
pierre
returned
may
i
come
in
he
asked
as
eloise
held
the
door
open
hesitatingly
if
you
wish
they
sat
a
moment
silently
in
the
parlor
monsieur
said
eloise
commencing
hurriedly
but
determinedly
in
this
life
everything
is
uncertain
so
much
depends
upon
mere
circumstances
which
are
too
obscure
for
us
to
control
i
am
willing
to
show
you
the
furniture
but
how
much
depends
upon
that
she
rose
with
the
air
of
a
heroine
and
led
the
way
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
pierre
followed
she
had
ascended
three
steps
and
he
had
his
hand
on
the
newel
post
when
there
was
a
crash
in
the
room
above
eloise
turned
suddenly
and
leaned
against
the
banister
glancing
up
the
stairs
and
extending
her
hand
to
keep
pierre
back
monsieur
for
the
love
of
heaven
do
not
come
on
go
back
into
the
room
i
beg
of
i
am
leaving
you
in
danger
i
am
accustomed
to
it
i
beg
of
she
accompanied
these
words
with
an
imploring
gesture
pierre
went
into
the
room
where
he
paced
up
and
down
the
noise
increased
in
violence
and
then
ceased
altogether
eloise
returned
to
the
room
she
leaned
from
the
window
breathing
convulsively
she
plucked
one
of
the
lilac
leaves
and
bit
it
through
and
through
yet
the
furniture
must
be
sold
she
said
aloud
pierre
took
a
step
toward
her
mademoiselle
you
are
in
distress
may
i
not
help
you
i
am
able
to
you
can
command
alas
monsieur
you
mean
i
can
command
your
pierre
was
profoundly
moved
at
the
sorrow
in
her
girlish
voice
i
mean
i
would
help
you
i
want
to
do
what
i
can
for
let
us
go
no
farther
she
said
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
i
must
not
come
into
your
happy
there
was
a
trace
of
bitterness
in
her
tone
i
have
undertaken
to
buy
the
furniture
he
said
with
a
smile
i
will
not
give
up
so
maurice
maurice
you
are
a
splendid
ogre
said
eloise
throwing
open
the
door
it
is
terribly
exhausting
he
said
with
a
faint
smile
when
pierre
next
came
it
was
raining
quietly
through
a
silver
haze
the
little
maid
opened
the
door
a
moment
later
eloise
came
into
the
room
when
she
spoke
her
voice
sounded
restrained
and
to
pierre
she
seemed
completely
different
i
have
deceived
you
she
commenced
without
prelude
there
is
no
furniture
to
to
all
his
questions
or
remonstrances
she
gave
him
this
answer
as
if
she
were
afraid
to
trust
herself
to
other
words
standing
with
her
eyes
cast
to
the
floor
and
an
expressionless
face
but
when
she
seemed
the
most
distant
as
if
she
could
not
recede
further
she
burst
into
tears
pierre
hurried
toward
mademoiselle
i
can
not
address
you
by
name
you
can
not
deceive
me
you
are
in
great
distress
i
beg
you
not
to
think
of
the
furniture
it
is
not
necessary
that
these
things
of
wood
should
trouble
you
further
i
did
not
come
to
see
it
i
came
to
see
oh
monsieur
she
sobbed
you
must
never
come
here
again
make
no
mistake
i
will
come
at
least
until
i
can
help
you
until
i
know
your
he
gained
her
hand
monsieur
i
can
not
accept
your
assistance
but
your
kindness
demands
my
she
told
it
she
was
a
lovely
girl
caught
in
a
net
of
circumstances
she
was
an
orphan
her
parents
had
left
her
and
her
brother
a
little
little
to
live
existed
her
brother
was
a
often
had
she
wished
she
was
was
wicked
she
hinted
at
unkindness
at
tyranny
it
was
necessary
to
sell
these
here
pierre
pressed
her
hand
you
could
not
deceive
me
he
said
but
he
would
not
hear
of
it
her
life
was
she
must
live
it
to
the
the
end
if
i
could
have
deceived
you
monsieur
i
would
have
done
a
smile
shimmered
through
her
tears
pierre
pressed
her
hand
she
softly
drew
it
away
suddenly
there
was
a
crash
in
the
room
above
a
light
shower
of
dry
was
thrown
down
around
them
the
sound
of
an
inhuman
voice
came
feebly
down
the
stairs
i
must
go
do
not
detain
me
she
cried
as
pierre
tried
to
intercept
her
he
endeavored
to
hold
her
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
do
not
go
i
beg
of
she
turned
sweetly
toward
him
i
must
go
it
is
my
duty
you
do
the
tears
were
not
yet
dry
on
her
eyelids
pierre
watched
her
flutter
upstairs
like
a
dove
flying
into
a
hawk
s
nest
his
pulses
were
pounding
at
his
wrists
i
wish
i
knew
what
my
duty
was
he
said
to
himself
as
he
left
the
house
he
glanced
up
at
the
window
a
handkerchief
dropped
down
he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
and
thrust
it
into
his
bosom
when
he
was
out
of
sight
he
examined
it
it
was
a
dainty
thing
of
the
most
delicate
fabric
in
one
corner
were
the
words
eloise
eloise
found
maurice
almost
fainting
with
his
exertion
when
he
recovered
he
is
the
game
worth
the
candle
well
we
will
eloise
you
have
been
i
cry
easily
i
do
everything
maurice
turned
away
and
gazed
from
the
window
the
rain
was
so
fine
it
seemed
to
be
a
rising
mist
the
trees
were
hidden
like
plants
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea
somewhere
the
sun
was
shining
for
there
was
a
silver
bar
in
the
mist
pierre
was
not
slow
in
coming
again
but
instead
of
seeing
eloise
he
had
a
note
thrust
into
his
hand
by
the
little
it
ran
i
can
not
see
you
forbids
it
who
could
have
told
that
our
last
word
was
if
i
could
have
spoken
again
i
would
have
thanked
you
how
can
i
ever
do
so
now
reading
this
on
the
step
he
scrawled
hurriedly
on
a
leaf
of
his
i
would
not
have
you
thank
me
but
i
must
see
you
again
your
risk
is
great
but
i
will
be
here
night
we
will
have
the
darkness
and
all
i
ask
is
ten
minutes
is
it
too
much
he
gave
the
note
to
the
maid
who
shut
the
door
the
house
looked
absolutely
as
he
walked
away
from
it
the
next
night
was
moist
with
a
touch
of
frost
a
little
smoke
from
burning
leaves
hung
in
the
air
with
a
pungent
odor
the
scent
of
the
lilacs
fell
with
the
wind
when
it
moved
eloise
was
muffled
picturesquely
in
a
cloak
pierre
was
holding
her
hand
which
she
had
not
reclaimed
i
have
dared
everything
to
come
she
said
softly
you
are
brave
braver
than
i
was
to
ask
you
know
my
story
you
are
the
only
that
binds
how
can
i
thank
you
you
must
not
try
i
have
done
just
then
a
burning
brand
was
hurled
from
the
window
it
fell
into
the
where
it
devoured
a
cone
of
blossom
and
withered
the
leaves
around
it
it
threw
up
a
little
springing
flame
which
danced
a
light
on
eloise
who
had
cowered
into
a
corner
by
the
steps
with
her
hand
over
her
eyes
pierre
went
to
her
tell
me
he
said
what
does
this
mean
oh
she
moaned
he
suspects
we
are
here
he
always
has
a
fire
on
the
hottest
nights
and
he
is
throwing
the
sticks
this
led
pierre
to
expect
another
one
he
caught
her
by
the
arm
you
must
come
out
of
danger
he
said
one
might
fall
on
your
the
brand
was
glowing
in
spots
he
tore
it
out
of
the
bush
and
trampled
on
it
they
went
to
the
other
side
of
the
steps
it
was
the
season
of
quick
growth
in
one
day
thousands
of
violets
had
lit
their
little
tips
of
yellow
fire
in
the
tangle
of
the
underwood
in
one
day
the
tulips
were
moulded
into
fragile
cups
of
flame
burning
steady
in
the
sunlight
in
one
day
the
lilacs
had
burst
their
little
blooms
and
were
crowding
in
the
leaves
pierre
was
saying
excitedly
listen
to
me
this
thing
can
not
go
further
i
love
you
i
am
yours
i
must
protect
you
you
can
not
deny
eloise
tried
to
stop
him
with
an
imploring
gesture
no
he
cried
you
must
hear
me
you
must
be
mine
i
will
take
you
away
from
oh
do
not
tempt
me
cried
eloise
i
must
stay
here
i
can
not
leave
you
must
leave
him
what
hold
has
he
upon
you
i
will
never
let
you
go
back
to
this
torment
eloise
he
continued
seriously
sometimes
we
have
to
decide
in
a
moment
the
things
of
a
this
is
such
a
moment
before
i
pluck
this
blossom
he
said
leaning
down
to
a
dwarf
bearing
one
bloom
i
want
you
to
promise
to
be
my
a
moment
later
he
had
plucked
the
flower
but
had
dropped
it
and
had
caught
eloise
in
his
arms
she
stifled
a
cry
and
gave
herself
to
him
maurice
maurice
cried
eloise
look
at
me
i
am
triumphant
he
hardly
looked
at
her
he
was
cowering
over
the
fire
which
had
smouldered
away
and
in
which
the
ashes
were
fluttering
about
like
moths
i
have
done
what
you
asked
that
is
all
he
said
with
an
effort
but
it
is
everything
to
me
i
will
never
forget
you
maurice
no
matter
how
powerful
i
may
alas
you
need
not
remember
me
for
long
perhaps
i
will
have
what
i
wanted
here
in
some
other
a
few
evenings
later
eloise
drew
the
door
after
her
hush
she
said
the
least
noise
will
disturb
she
hesitated
and
left
the
door
ajar
do
you
regret
whispered
pierre
no
but
i
am
leaving
yes
even
the
old
furniture
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
i
would
never
have
known
you
he
said
murmured
eloise
she
listened
for
a
moment
and
then
shut
the
door
softly
on
the
empty
house
maurice
had
gone
to
the
hospital
that
afternoon
the
little
maid
had
been
discharged
but
she
said
holding
pierre
s
arm
and
leaning
away
from
him
with
her
sweet
smile
i
have
also
gained
the
next
moment
they
had
gone
cautiously
away
this
was
the
beginning
of
her
career
the
bobolink
it
was
the
sunniest
corner
in
viger
where
old
garnaud
had
built
his
cabin
cabin
for
it
could
not
be
called
a
house
it
was
only
of
one
story
with
a
kitchen
behind
and
a
workshop
in
front
where
etienne
garnaud
mended
the
shoes
of
viger
he
had
lived
there
by
himself
ever
since
he
came
from
valérie
every
one
knew
his
story
every
one
liked
him
a
merry
heart
had
the
old
shoemaker
it
made
a
merry
heart
to
see
him
bending
his
white
head
with
its
beautiful
features
above
his
homely
work
and
to
hear
his
voice
in
a
high
cadence
of
song
the
broad
window
of
his
cabin
was
covered
with
a
shutter
hinged
at
the
top
which
was
propped
up
by
a
stick
slanted
from
the
in
the
summer
the
sash
was
removed
and
through
the
opening
came
the
even
sound
of
the
blanche
against
the
bridge
piers
or
the
from
some
hidden
meadow
from
it
there
was
a
view
of
a
little
pool
of
the
stream
where
the
perch
jumped
clear
into
the
sun
and
where
a
birch
growing
on
the
bank
threw
a
silver
from
side
to
side
farther
up
too
were
the
willows
that
wore
the
yellow
tassels
in
the
spring
and
the
hollow
where
were
in
august
on
the
hill
slope
stood
a
delicate
maple
that
reddened
the
moment
summer
had
gone
which
old
etienne
watched
with
a
sigh
and
a
shake
of
the
head
if
the
old
man
was
a
favorite
with
the
elder
people
of
viger
he
was
a
yet
greater
favorite
with
the
children
no
small
portion
of
his
earnings
went
toward
the
purchase
of
sugar
candy
for
their
consumption
on
summer
afternoons
he
would
lay
out
a
row
of
sweet
lumps
on
his
and
pretend
to
be
absorbed
by
his
work
as
the
children
with
much
suppressed
laughter
darted
around
the
corner
of
his
cabin
bearing
away
the
spoils
he
would
pause
every
now
and
then
to
call
where
are
all
my
sweeties
those
mice
and
rats
must
have
been
after
them
again
and
would
chuckle
to
himself
to
hear
the
children
trying
to
keep
back
the
laughter
out
of
sight
around
the
corner
in
the
winter
when
the
boys
and
girls
would
come
in
to
see
him
work
he
always
managed
to
drop
some
candy
into
their
pockets
which
they
would
find
afterward
with
less
surprise
than
the
old
man
imagined
but
his
great
friend
was
the
little
blind
daughter
of
his
neighbor
moreau
here
comes
my
little
fairy
he
would
call
out
as
he
saw
her
feeling
her
way
down
the
road
with
her
little
cedar
wand
here
comes
my
little
fairy
and
he
would
go
out
to
guide
her
across
the
one
plank
thrown
over
the
ditch
in
front
of
his
cabin
then
they
would
sit
and
chat
together
this
beautiful
old
man
and
the
beautiful
little
girl
she
raised
her
soft
brown
sightless
eyes
to
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
he
told
her
long
romances
described
the
things
that
lay
around
them
or
strove
to
answer
her
questions
this
was
his
hardest
task
and
he
often
failed
in
it
her
questions
ran
beyond
his
power
and
left
him
mystified
one
spring
he
bought
a
bobolink
from
some
boys
who
had
trapped
it
and
he
hung
its
cage
in
the
sun
outside
his
cabin
there
it
would
sing
or
be
silent
for
days
at
a
time
little
blanche
would
sit
outside
under
the
shade
of
the
shutter
leaning
half
into
the
room
to
hear
the
old
man
talk
but
keeping
half
in
the
air
to
hear
the
bird
sing
they
called
him
jack
by
mutual
consent
and
he
absorbed
a
great
deal
of
their
attention
blanche
had
to
be
present
at
every
cage
cleaning
one
day
she
said
uncle
garnaud
what
is
he
like
why
dearie
he
s
a
beauty
he
s
black
all
over
except
his
wings
and
tail
and
they
have
white
on
and
what
are
his
wings
like
well
now
that
finishes
me
i
am
an
old
fool
or
i
could
tell
uncle
garnaud
i
never
even
felt
a
bird
could
i
feel
jack
well
i
could
catch
him
but
you
mustn
t
squeeze
jack
was
caught
with
a
sudden
dart
of
the
old
man
s
hand
the
little
blind
girl
felt
him
softly
traced
the
shape
of
his
outstretched
wing
and
put
him
back
into
the
cage
with
a
sigh
tell
me
uncle
garnaud
she
asked
how
did
they
catch
him
well
you
see
they
put
a
little
cage
on
a
stump
in
the
and
the
bird
flew
over
and
went
well
didn
t
he
know
they
would
not
let
him
out
if
he
once
went
in
well
you
know
he
hadn
t
any
old
uncle
to
tell
him
well
but
birds
must
have
uncles
if
they
have
fathers
just
like
we
old
etienne
puckered
up
his
eyes
and
put
his
awl
through
his
hair
the
bird
ran
down
a
whole
cadence
as
if
he
was
on
the
wind
over
a
then
he
stopped
there
uncle
garnaud
i
know
he
must
mean
something
by
that
what
did
he
do
all
day
before
he
was
caught
i
don
t
think
he
did
any
work
he
just
flew
about
and
sang
all
day
and
picked
up
seeds
and
sang
and
tried
to
balance
himself
on
the
he
sang
all
day
well
he
doesn
t
do
that
the
bird
seemed
to
recall
a
sunny
for
his
interlude
was
as
light
as
thistledown
and
after
a
pause
he
made
two
little
sounds
like
the
ringing
of
bells
at
titania
s
girdle
perhaps
he
doesn
t
like
to
be
shut
up
and
have
nobody
but
us
she
said
after
a
moment
well
said
the
old
man
hesitatingly
we
might
let
him
yes
faltered
the
child
we
might
let
him
the
next
time
little
blanche
was
there
she
said
and
he
didn
t
do
anything
but
that
just
sing
and
fly
no
i
think
well
then
he
could
fly
miles
and
miles
and
never
come
back
if
he
didn
t
want
to
why
yes
he
went
away
every
winter
so
that
the
frost
wouldn
t
bite
oh
uncle
garnaud
he
didn
t
did
he
yes
true
he
the
little
girl
was
silent
for
a
while
when
the
old
man
looked
at
her
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
why
my
pretty
what
s
the
matter
oh
i
was
just
thinking
that
why
he
didn
t
sing
was
because
he
only
saw
you
and
me
and
the
road
and
our
trees
when
he
used
to
have
well
said
the
old
man
stopping
his
work
he
might
have
everything
again
you
might
he
she
asked
doubtfully
why
we
might
let
him
fly
the
bird
dropped
a
clear
note
or
two
oh
uncle
garnaud
do
let
him
go
why
beauty
just
as
you
the
old
man
put
off
his
apron
and
took
the
cage
down
here
little
girl
you
hold
the
cage
and
we
ll
go
where
he
can
fly
blanche
carried
the
cage
and
he
took
her
hand
they
walked
down
to
the
bridge
and
set
the
cage
on
the
rail
now
dearie
open
the
door
said
the
old
man
the
little
child
felt
for
the
slide
and
pushed
it
back
in
a
moment
the
bird
rushed
out
and
flew
madly
off
he
s
gone
she
said
jack
s
gone
where
did
he
go
uncle
he
flew
right
through
that
and
now
he
s
over
the
fields
and
now
he
s
out
of
and
didn
t
he
even
once
look
back
no
never
they
stood
there
together
for
a
moment
the
old
man
gazing
after
the
departed
bird
the
little
girl
setting
her
brown
sightless
eyes
on
the
invisible
distance
then
taking
the
empty
cage
they
went
back
to
the
cabin
from
that
day
their
friendship
was
not
untinged
by
regret
some
delicate
mist
of
sorrow
seemed
to
have
blurred
the
glass
of
memory
though
he
could
not
tell
why
old
etienne
that
evening
felt
anew
his
loneliness
as
he
watched
a
long
sunset
of
red
and
gold
that
lingered
after
the
footsteps
of
the
august
day
and
cast
a
great
color
into
his
silent
cabin
above
the
blanche
the
tragedy
of
the
seigniory
there
was
a
house
on
the
outskirts
of
viger
called
by
courtesy
the
seigniory
passing
down
one
of
the
you
caught
sight
of
it
set
upon
a
rise
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
street
or
seemingly
with
any
part
of
the
town
built
into
the
bank
as
it
was
the
front
had
three
stories
while
the
back
had
but
two
the
lower
flat
half
cellar
half
kitchen
was
lighted
from
a
broad
door
and
two
windows
facing
the
southeast
entrance
to
the
second
floor
was
had
by
a
flight
of
steps
to
a
wide
gallery
running
completely
across
the
front
of
the
house
then
above
this
second
story
there
was
a
roof
with
the
walls
of
the
kitchen
story
were
rough
stone
while
the
upper
part
had
been
plastered
and
overlaid
with
a
wash
but
time
had
cracked
off
the
plaster
in
many
places
and
showed
the
solid
stones
with
all
the
ravages
of
time
upon
it
and
with
all
its
old
surroundings
gone
it
yet
had
an
air
of
some
distinction
with
its
shoulder
to
the
street
and
its
independent
solidity
it
made
men
remember
days
gone
by
when
it
was
only
a
on
the
estate
of
the
rioux
family
yet
of
that
estate
this
old
house
with
its
surrounding
three
acres
of
land
was
all
that
remained
and
of
the
retainers
that
once
held
allegiance
to
this
proud
name
louis
bois
was
the
last
living
alone
in
the
old
house
growing
old
with
it
guarding
some
secret
and
keeping
at
a
proper
distance
the
inquisitive
and
loquacious
villagers
had
given
louis
also
some
distinction
he
was
reported
an
old
soldier
and
bore
about
the
witness
of
it
in
a
wooden
leg
he
swore
when
angry
in
a
cavalier
fashion
using
the
heavier
english
oaths
with
some
freedom
his
bravery
having
never
been
put
to
proof
rested
securely
upon
these
foundations
but
he
had
a
more
definite
charm
for
the
villagers
he
was
supposed
to
have
money
of
his
own
and
afforded
the
charming
spectacle
of
a
human
being
vegetating
like
a
plant
without
effort
and
without
trouble
louis
bois
had
grown
large
in
his
indolence
and
towards
the
end
of
his
career
he
moved
with
less
frequency
and
greater
difficulty
his
face
was
round
and
fat
the
hair
had
never
grown
on
it
and
the
skin
was
fine
and
smooth
as
an
orange
without
wrinkles
but
marked
with
very
decided
pores
the
expression
of
amiability
that
his
mouth
promised
was
destroyed
by
an
eye
of
suspicious
restlessness
about
fifteen
years
before
the
time
of
his
release
louis
had
been
sworn
to
his
post
by
the
last
of
the
rioux
armand
theophile
this
young
man
of
high
spirit
and
passionate
courage
found
himself
at
the
age
of
after
two
years
of
intermittent
study
at
a
jesuit
college
fatherless
and
without
a
sou
to
call
his
own
of
the
family
estate
the
round
which
viger
had
closed
was
all
that
remained
and
from
its
windows
this
fiery
youth
might
look
across
the
ten
acres
that
were
his
over
miles
of
hill
and
wood
to
which
his
grandfather
had
been
born
this
vista
tortured
him
for
three
days
when
he
sold
seven
of
his
acres
keeping
the
rest
from
pride
then
he
shook
off
the
dust
of
viger
but
not
before
swearing
louis
bois
who
was
old
enough
to
be
his
father
and
loved
him
as
such
to
stay
and
watch
the
forlorn
hope
of
the
rioux
estate
until
he
the
last
of
the
line
should
return
and
redeem
his
ancient
heritage
he
would
be
gone
ten
years
he
said
and
louis
reflected
with
pride
that
his
own
money
would
keep
him
that
long
and
longer
at
first
he
kept
the
whole
house
open
and
entertained
some
of
his
friends
but
he
soon
discovered
that
he
lost
money
by
that
and
gradually
he
boarded
up
the
windows
and
lived
in
the
kitchen
and
one
room
of
the
upper
flat
he
was
a
sensitive
being
this
and
his
master
s
idea
had
taken
hold
upon
him
his
burly
frame
contained
a
faint
heart
he
had
no
physical
courage
and
he
was
as
suspicious
as
a
savage
moreover
he
was
superstitious
as
superstitious
as
an
old
wife
and
odd
occurrences
made
him
uneasy
if
he
could
have
been
allowed
to
doze
on
his
gallery
in
the
sun
all
his
days
and
sleep
secure
of
dreams
and
visitations
all
his
nights
his
life
might
have
been
bearable
the
first
three
years
of
his
stewardship
were
comparatively
uneventful
he
traced
his
liege
s
progress
through
the
civilized
world
by
the
on
his
letters
which
sometimes
contained
a
bill
of
exchange
of
which
the
great
and
safe
bank
of
bardé
brothers
took
charge
as
yet
his
master
had
not
captured
a
treasure
ship
but
seven
years
remained
at
the
beginning
of
his
fourth
year
something
happened
which
disturbed
louis
existence
to
its
centre
an
emissary
of
the
devil
in
the
guise
of
a
surveyor
planted
his
theodolite
and
ran
a
roadway
which
took
off
a
corner
of
his
three
acres
and
for
this
he
received
only
an
arbitrator
s
allowance
in
vain
he
stumped
up
and
down
his
gallery
and
in
vain
his
english
roadway
went
through
to
add
to
his
trouble
the
letters
from
the
wanderer
ceased
was
he
dead
had
he
forgotten
no
more
money
was
coming
in
and
louis
had
the
perpetual
sight
of
the
alienated
lands
before
his
eyes
one
day
when
he
was
coming
home
from
the
bank
his
eye
caught
a
poster
that
made
him
think
it
was
an
announcement
of
a
famous
lottery
do
what
he
would
he
could
not
get
it
out
of
his
head
and
that
evening
when
he
was
cooking
his
supper
he
resolved
to
make
money
after
a
fashion
of
his
own
he
saw
himself
a
suddenly
rich
man
the
winner
of
the
prize
he
felt
his
knee
burn
under
him
and
felt
also
what
a
dead
thing
his
wooden
leg
was
he
began
to
venture
small
sums
in
the
lottery
hoarding
half
his
monthly
allowance
until
he
should
have
sufficient
funds
to
purchase
a
ticket
waiting
for
the
moment
when
he
could
buy
and
then
waiting
for
the
moment
when
he
could
receive
news
of
the
drawing
lent
a
feverish
interest
to
his
life
but
he
failed
to
win
with
his
failure
grew
a
sort
of
would
win
he
said
if
he
spent
every
cent
he
owned
he
had
moments
when
he
suspected
that
he
was
being
duped
but
he
was
always
reassured
upon
spelling
out
the
lottery
circular
where
the
drawing
by
the
two
orphan
children
was
so
touchingly
described
at
last
after
repeated
failures
he
drew
every
cent
of
his
own
that
he
could
muster
and
bought
a
whole
ticket
he
never
rested
a
moment
until
the
returns
came
he
had
days
of
high
spirits
when
he
touched
his
gains
and
saw
them
heaped
before
him
and
other
days
of
depression
when
he
cursed
his
ill
luck
and
saw
blanks
written
everywhere
when
he
learned
the
result
his
last
disappointment
was
his
greatest
he
had
drawn
a
blank
he
was
in
a
perfect
fury
of
rage
and
went
off
to
bed
cursing
like
a
when
he
took
off
his
wooden
leg
he
took
it
by
the
foot
and
beat
the
floor
with
the
until
he
got
some
relief
could
he
have
captured
he
would
have
murdered
the
innocent
orphan
children
he
swore
never
to
be
tempted
again
but
the
morning
when
he
took
that
oath
april
was
bleak
on
the
hills
and
a
tardy
spring
circled
in
cold
sunshine
leaving
the
buds
suspended
when
may
came
his
hope
again
blossomed
slowly
and
certainly
his
mind
approached
that
money
he
had
in
trust
for
his
master
until
one
sultry
day
in
june
he
saw
his
way
to
success
and
felt
his
conscience
lulled
that
afternoon
he
dozed
on
the
gallery
and
dreamed
he
felt
he
was
in
heaven
and
the
heaven
of
his
dreams
was
a
large
cathedral
whose
nave
he
had
walked
somewhere
in
his
journeyings
he
saw
the
solemn
passages
the
penetrating
shafts
of
light
the
obscure
altar
rising
dimly
in
the
alcove
and
from
the
glamour
round
the
altar
floated
down
a
magnificent
angel
and
with
a
look
of
perfect
knowledge
in
his
eyes
shamed
him
for
his
base
resolve
slowly
as
louis
quailed
before
him
he
dwindled
shimmering
in
the
glory
shaken
from
his
vesture
until
he
grew
very
faint
and
indistinct
and
dissolved
slowly
into
light
then
his
vision
swayed
aside
and
he
saw
his
own
gallery
and
a
little
dog
that
sat
with
his
back
towards
him
eying
him
over
his
shoulder
superstitious
louis
shuddered
when
he
saw
this
dog
he
thought
there
was
something
uncanny
about
him
but
to
a
casual
observer
he
was
an
ordinary
dog
of
mixed
blood
he
had
a
sharp
nose
and
ears
piercing
eyes
straight
hair
rather
white
upon
the
breast
and
a
tail
curled
down
upon
his
back
he
was
a
small
dog
an
intense
nervousness
animated
his
every
movement
louis
was
afraid
to
drive
him
away
and
so
long
as
he
saw
him
he
could
not
forget
his
dream
and
the
reproof
he
had
had
from
heaven
gradually
he
came
to
believe
the
animal
was
a
spirit
in
canine
form
his
reasons
for
this
were
that
the
dog
never
slept
or
at
least
never
seemed
to
sleep
all
day
long
he
followed
louis
about
if
he
dozed
in
his
chair
the
dog
laid
his
nose
between
his
paws
and
watched
him
if
he
woke
at
night
his
eyes
burned
in
the
darkness
again
he
never
seemed
to
eat
anything
and
he
was
never
heard
to
utter
a
sound
louis
of
him
gave
him
a
name
he
called
him
fidele
he
also
tried
to
coax
him
but
to
no
purpose
the
dog
never
approached
him
except
when
he
went
to
sleep
then
he
would
move
nearer
to
him
at
last
he
got
greater
confidence
and
louis
awoke
from
a
doze
one
day
to
find
him
gnawing
his
wooden
leg
he
tried
to
frighten
him
off
but
fidele
had
acquired
the
habit
and
stuck
to
it
whenever
louis
would
fall
asleep
fidele
would
approach
him
softly
and
chew
his
leg
perhaps
it
was
the
soft
tremor
that
was
imparted
to
his
fleshy
leg
from
the
gnawing
of
the
wooden
one
but
louis
never
slept
more
soundly
than
when
this
was
progressing
he
saw
however
with
dismay
his
hickory
support
vanishing
and
to
avoid
wasting
his
money
on
wooden
legs
he
covered
the
one
he
had
with
tacks
in
the
end
the
dog
came
to
be
a
sort
of
conscience
for
him
he
could
never
look
at
his
piercing
eyes
without
thinking
of
the
way
he
had
been
warned
to
pay
for
his
recklessness
louis
had
to
live
on
a
pittance
for
years
just
enough
to
keep
himself
alive
he
might
have
lost
his
taste
for
gambling
through
this
rigor
and
his
temptation
to
use
his
master
s
money
might
never
have
returned
but
in
his
lottery
business
he
had
made
a
confidant
of
one
of
the
messengers
of
the
bardé
bank
the
fellow
s
name
was
jacques
potvin
he
was
full
of
dissimulation
he
loved
a
lie
for
its
own
sake
he
devoured
the
simple
character
of
louis
bois
whenever
they
met
louis
was
treated
to
a
flushed
account
of
all
sorts
of
escapades
made
in
a
of
thousands
by
a
at
last
as
a
crowning
success
jacques
potvin
himself
had
won
a
thousand
dollars
in
a
drawing
that
louis
could
not
participate
in
this
was
galling
to
have
that
money
lying
idle
never
to
hear
from
his
master
rioux
who
was
probably
dead
and
to
see
chance
after
chance
slip
by
him
he
gave
his
trouble
to
potvin
potvin
took
the
weight
lightly
and
threw
it
over
his
shoulder
bah
he
said
if
i
had
that
money
under
my
fingers
i
would
be
a
rich
man
before
the
year
was
the
fever
was
in
louis
blood
again
he
tossed
a
sleepless
night
and
then
resolved
desperately
he
shut
fidele
up
in
the
attic
and
went
off
and
bought
a
ticket
with
his
master
s
money
when
he
came
back
from
the
bank
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
fidele
seated
in
one
of
the
watching
him
it
would
be
six
months
before
he
could
get
any
news
of
his
venture
six
months
of
fidele
and
an
accusing
conscience
half
the
time
was
scarcely
over
when
to
his
horror
and
joy
came
a
letter
from
his
master
it
was
dated
at
rio
he
was
on
his
way
home
he
would
arrive
in
about
six
months
the
probable
failure
of
his
scheme
gave
louis
agony
now
he
would
have
to
face
his
master
who
would
arrive
at
christmas
if
his
plans
were
discharged
with
a
rifled
bank
account
on
the
other
hand
if
he
should
be
successful
that
gold
how
it
haunted
him
one
night
on
the
eve
of
his
expectation
louis
fell
asleep
as
he
was
cooking
his
supper
he
slept
long
and
when
he
awoke
his
stove
was
he
started
up
staring
at
something
figured
on
the
red
stove
door
it
was
only
the
number
of
the
stove
but
it
was
also
the
number
of
his
ticket
he
waited
after
that
in
perfect
serenity
and
when
his
notice
came
he
opened
it
with
calmness
he
had
won
the
prize
he
went
off
hot
foot
to
potvin
of
course
he
said
i
ll
have
them
send
it
to
the
bardé
just
keep
cool
said
potvin
of
course
you
ll
do
nothing
of
the
but
why
why
wait
and
see
the
imperial
bank
is
safe
enough
for
louis
had
the
money
sent
to
the
imperial
bank
a
short
time
after
this
when
louis
passed
the
bardé
bank
a
crowd
of
people
were
besieging
the
doors
and
reading
the
placards
the
bank
had
suspended
payment
the
shrewdness
of
potvin
had
saved
his
thousand
when
he
next
met
jacques
he
hugged
him
to
his
heart
jacques
laid
his
finger
on
his
nose
deeper
still
he
said
i
know
i
that
the
imperial
itself
is
totterish
this
affair
of
the
bardés
has
made
things
shaky
see
everything
is
on
three
legs
if
i
were
you
now
if
were
you
i
d
just
draw
that
thousand
dollars
and
lay
it
away
in
a
till
this
blows
but
said
louis
in
a
panic
i
have
no
but
have
said
jacques
louis
laid
his
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
could
have
wept
christmas
passed
but
no
sign
of
hugo
armand
theophile
but
the
second
week
in
january
brought
a
letter
two
days
old
from
new
york
rioux
would
be
in
viger
in
a
week
at
the
latest
louis
was
in
great
spirits
he
planned
a
surprise
for
his
master
he
went
off
to
find
jacques
potvin
but
jacques
was
not
to
be
found
louis
arranged
that
jacques
was
to
meet
him
at
a
tavern
called
the
blue
bells
the
next
day
but
said
jacques
when
they
met
this
is
absurd
what
do
you
want
the
money
for
never
mind
i
want
it
that
s
but
think
thousand
dollars
i
want
it
for
a
few
days
just
the
it
not
mine
some
one
in
the
next
compartment
rose
and
put
his
ear
to
the
partition
the
voices
were
low
but
he
could
hear
them
well
listening
intently
his
eyes
seemed
to
sink
into
his
head
and
burn
there
darkly
well
so
it
is
concluded
jacques
i
will
get
it
for
you
but
we
ll
have
to
do
the
thing
quietly
very
quietly
i
ll
drive
out
to
viger
night
say
i
ll
meet
you
at
that
vacant
field
next
the
church
at
eleven
and
the
money
will
be
the
listener
in
the
next
compartment
withdrew
hastily
and
mingled
with
the
crowd
at
the
bar
that
night
he
wandered
out
to
viger
he
observed
the
church
and
the
vacant
lot
and
saw
that
there
were
here
and
there
hollows
under
the
sidewalk
where
a
man
might
crouch
he
afterward
wandered
about
for
a
while
and
found
himself
in
front
of
the
old
a
side
window
of
the
second
story
was
filled
with
the
flicker
of
a
fire
a
ladder
leaned
against
the
wall
and
ran
up
past
the
window
he
hesitated
whether
to
ascend
the
or
the
ladder
he
chose
the
ladder
with
his
foot
on
the
lowest
rung
he
said
if
i
hadn
t
this
little
scheme
on
hand
i
would
go
in
he
went
up
the
ladder
and
looked
in
at
the
window
louis
bois
was
asleep
before
the
fire
fidele
lay
by
his
side
the
man
caught
the
dog
s
eye
louis
woke
nervously
and
saw
a
figure
at
the
window
the
only
thing
he
discerned
distinctly
was
a
white
sort
of
cap
in
his
sudden
fear
seeking
something
to
throw
he
touched
fidele
and
without
thinking
he
hurled
him
full
at
the
man
the
dog
s
body
broke
the
old
sash
and
crashed
through
the
glass
the
fellow
vanished
when
louis
had
regained
his
courage
he
let
fidele
in
there
was
not
a
scratch
on
him
he
lay
down
about
ten
yards
from
louis
and
looked
at
him
fixedly
the
old
soldier
had
no
sleep
that
night
and
no
peace
the
next
day
the
next
night
was
wild
louis
looked
from
his
window
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
on
the
icy
fields
that
glared
with
as
white
a
radiance
over
the
polished
surface
drifted
loose
masses
of
snow
and
clouds
rushed
across
the
moon
he
took
his
cloak
his
stick
and
a
and
locking
fidele
in
started
forth
a
few
moments
after
he
reached
the
rendezvous
jacques
drove
up
in
a
berlin
here
it
is
jacques
said
pressing
a
box
into
his
hands
the
key
that
hangs
there
will
open
it
i
must
be
off
be
careful
jacques
whirled
away
in
the
wind
there
was
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
louis
clutched
his
knife
and
turned
toward
home
he
had
not
left
the
church
very
far
behind
when
he
thought
he
heard
something
moving
a
cloud
obscured
the
moon
a
figure
leaned
out
from
under
the
sidewalk
and
observed
him
a
moment
later
it
sprang
upon
the
pathway
and
leaped
forward
louis
was
sure
some
one
was
there
half
looking
round
he
made
a
swipe
in
the
air
with
his
knife
it
encountered
something
looking
round
fairly
he
saw
a
man
with
a
whitish
cap
stagger
off
the
sidewalk
and
fall
in
the
snow
hurrying
on
he
looked
back
a
moment
later
and
saw
the
figure
of
the
man
receding
making
with
incredible
swiftness
across
the
vacant
space
louis
once
out
of
sight
the
man
doubled
with
the
rapidity
of
a
wounded
beast
and
after
plunging
through
was
again
in
front
of
the
he
ascended
the
ladder
with
some
difficulty
and
entered
the
room
by
the
window
where
he
expected
to
find
his
faithful
steward
there
was
only
a
white
dog
that
neither
moved
nor
barked
and
that
watched
him
fixedly
as
he
fell
huddled
and
fainting
on
the
bunk
a
few
minutes
later
louis
reached
home
the
sickness
of
fear
possessed
him
he
staggered
into
the
room
and
sat
before
the
fire
trying
to
control
himself
when
he
was
calmer
he
found
himself
clutching
the
box
he
threw
off
his
cloak
and
took
the
key
to
fit
it
into
the
lock
the
key
was
too
large
in
vain
he
fussed
and
would
not
go
in
he
shook
the
box
nothing
rattled
or
moved
a
horrid
suspicion
crossed
his
mind
what
if
jacques
had
stolen
the
money
what
if
there
was
nothing
in
the
box
he
seized
the
poker
in
a
frenzy
and
beat
the
box
open
it
was
his
hand
went
round
in
it
mechanically
while
he
gazed
wild
with
conjecture
then
with
an
oath
he
flung
the
box
on
the
fire
and
turned
away
the
disturbed
brands
shot
a
glow
into
every
part
of
the
room
and
louis
saw
by
one
flash
a
gray
cap
which
he
recognized
lying
on
the
floor
by
the
next
he
saw
the
head
from
which
it
had
rolled
pillowed
on
his
bunk
he
tried
to
utter
a
cry
but
sank
into
his
chair
stricken
dumb
for
death
had
not
yet
softened
the
lines
of
desperate
cunning
on
the
face
which
in
spite
of
the
scars
of
a
wild
life
he
recognized
as
that
of
hugo
armand
theophile
rioux
the
look
of
that
cap
as
he
had
seen
it
through
the
window
the
glimpse
he
had
of
it
a
few
minutes
ago
when
he
swept
his
knife
back
through
the
air
the
face
of
his
the
thought
of
himself
duped
and
robbed
fixed
him
in
his
chair
where
he
hung
everything
reeled
before
him
but
in
a
dull
glare
he
saw
fidele
his
nose
between
his
extended
paws
and
his
eyes
fixed
keenly
upon
him
they
seemed
to
pierce
him
to
the
soul
until
their
gleam
which
had
followed
him
for
so
many
years
faded
out
with
all
the
familiar
lines
and
corners
of
his
room
engulfed
in
one
intense
palpitating
light
the
people
who
broke
open
the
house
saw
the
unexplained
tragedy
of
the
seigniory
but
they
did
not
find
fidele
nor
was
he
ever
seen
again
josephine
labrosse
josephine
said
madame
labrosse
quietly
through
her
josephine
we
must
set
up
a
little
said
josephine
with
a
movement
of
despair
every
one
sets
up
a
little
true
and
what
every
one
does
we
must
but
not
every
one
succeeds
and
ours
would
be
a
very
little
there
are
some
other
things
we
could
mamma
said
josephine
do
not
dare
let
us
set
up
a
little
and
accordingly
the
front
room
was
cleared
out
and
transformed
what
care
they
took
how
clean
it
all
was
when
they
were
at
last
ready
for
customers
even
to
a
diminutive
sign
my
daughter
who
will
wait
asked
madame
labrosse
i
will
wait
answered
josephine
and
she
hung
her
bird
in
the
window
put
the
door
ajar
and
waited
that
was
in
the
early
summer
before
the
blanche
had
forgotten
its
spring
song
mother
said
josephine
we
belong
to
the
people
who
do
not
true
replied
madame
labrosse
disconsolately
but
we
must
live
and
there
is
the
mother
and
she
cast
her
eyes
to
the
corner
where
her
own
mother
sat
drawing
at
her
pipe
so
dark
and
withered
as
to
look
like
a
piece
of
punk
that
had
caught
fire
and
was
going
off
in
smoke
but
there
are
some
things
we
can
mamma
do
not
but
this
time
madame
labrosse
dared
and
she
put
on
her
cloak
and
went
into
the
city
when
she
came
back
her
face
was
radiant
but
josephine
cried
herself
to
sleep
that
night
all
this
was
in
the
early
march
before
the
blanche
had
learned
its
spring
song
in
truth
if
the
shopkeeping
had
been
a
failure
was
it
the
fault
of
josephine
or
madame
labrosse
their
window
was
brighter
than
other
and
one
would
have
thought
that
people
would
have
come
in
if
only
to
look
at
the
sweet
eyes
of
josephine
and
hear
her
bird
sing
but
no
in
vain
for
months
had
the
candy
hearts
and
the
hung
in
the
window
it
was
the
crumble
and
crash
of
one
of
these
same
that
had
startled
josephine
into
the
confession
that
the
shop
was
not
a
success
in
vain
had
madame
labrosse
placed
steaming
plates
of
pork
and
beans
in
the
window
their
savor
only
went
up
and
rested
in
beads
on
the
pane
making
a
veil
behind
which
they
could
stiffen
and
grow
cold
in
protest
against
an
unappreciative
public
in
vain
had
she
made
crisp
and
delicate
it
only
grew
mealy
and
unresisting
and
josephine
was
in
danger
of
utterly
spoiling
her
complexion
by
eating
it
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
the
window
said
madame
labrosse
well
i
will
walk
out
and
see
said
josephine
and
she
came
sauntering
past
with
as
little
concern
as
possible
mother
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
wait
i
will
try
said
madame
labrosse
and
she
in
turn
came
sauntering
by
but
josephine
had
stood
in
the
door
and
her
mother
chancing
first
to
catch
sight
of
her
lost
her
view
of
the
window
in
her
surprise
at
the
anxious
beauty
of
her
daughter
s
face
well
josephine
why
did
you
stand
in
the
door
asked
her
mother
kissing
her
on
either
cheek
but
the
window
persisted
josephine
let
the
fiend
fly
away
with
the
window
said
her
mother
and
josephine
s
bird
catching
the
defiance
of
the
accent
burst
into
a
snatch
of
reckless
song
now
that
madame
labrosse
had
dared
so
much
josephine
was
not
to
be
outdone
and
she
commenced
to
sew
her
mother
always
went
away
early
in
the
morning
and
came
back
before
noon
and
one
day
she
caught
josephine
sewing
she
snatched
the
work
josephine
do
not
dare
when
she
next
found
her
at
work
she
said
nothing
but
instead
of
kissing
her
cheek
kissed
her
fingers
but
why
was
it
that
trouble
seemed
never
very
far
away
josephine
sewed
so
hard
that
she
commenced
to
take
stitches
in
her
side
and
of
a
sudden
madame
labrosse
fell
sick
that
she
could
not
do
her
work
and
josephine
had
to
go
to
the
city
with
a
message
her
heart
beat
as
she
passed
the
covered
with
strange
names
her
heart
stopped
beating
when
she
came
to
the
right
one
she
tapped
timidly
some
one
called
out
come
in
and
josephine
pushed
open
the
door
there
was
a
sudden
stir
in
the
room
the
lawyers
clerks
looked
up
and
then
tried
to
go
on
with
their
work
a
supercilious
young
man
minced
forward
and
josephine
gave
her
message
the
clerks
pretended
to
write
but
the
only
one
who
was
working
wrote
josephine
s
words
into
a
lease
that
he
was
the
said
party
of
the
second
part
when
she
went
away
he
leaned
over
the
supercilious
young
man
and
asked
where
did
she
say
she
lived
at
renard
said
the
young
man
at
which
every
one
laughed
except
his
inquirer
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
peering
through
his
glasses
at
the
place
where
josephine
had
stood
renard
was
there
ever
such
a
saint
in
the
calendar
was
there
ever
such
a
suburb
to
the
city
when
he
left
the
office
he
walked
as
straight
home
as
he
could
go
he
kept
repeating
josephine
s
words
to
himself
my
mother
madame
labrosse
being
sick
can
not
come
she
lives
at
renard
no
no
not
renard
when
he
had
arrived
at
the
house
where
he
had
boarded
for
ten
years
he
went
up
to
his
room
and
did
not
come
down
until
the
next
morning
when
he
had
shut
himself
in
he
commenced
to
rummage
in
his
trunk
and
at
last
after
tossing
everything
about
he
gave
a
cry
of
joy
and
pulled
out
a
flat
thin
book
he
spread
this
out
on
the
table
and
turned
the
leaves
on
the
first
page
were
some
verses
copied
by
himself
the
rest
of
the
book
was
full
of
silhouettes
cut
from
black
paper
and
pasted
on
the
white
he
found
a
fragment
of
this
paper
and
taking
his
scissors
he
commenced
to
cut
it
it
took
the
form
of
a
face
but
alas
not
the
face
that
was
in
his
mind
and
he
let
it
drop
in
despair
then
he
tried
to
sleep
but
he
could
not
sleep
through
his
head
kept
running
josephine
s
message
and
he
would
hesitate
at
renard
trying
to
remember
what
she
had
said
at
last
he
slept
and
had
a
dream
he
dreamed
that
he
was
sailing
down
a
stream
which
grew
narrower
and
narrower
at
last
his
boat
stopped
amid
a
tangle
of
weeds
and
all
around
him
on
the
broad
leaves
was
seated
a
chorus
of
frogs
singing
out
something
at
the
top
of
their
voices
he
listened
then
little
by
little
whatever
the
word
was
it
grew
more
distinct
until
one
huge
fellow
opened
his
mouth
and
roared
out
viger
which
brought
him
wide
awake
he
repeated
the
word
aloud
and
it
echoed
in
his
ears
growing
softer
and
softer
until
it
grew
beautiful
enough
to
fill
a
place
in
his
recollections
and
complete
the
my
mother
madame
labrosse
being
sick
can
not
come
she
lives
at
the
next
sunday
victor
dressed
himself
with
care
he
put
on
a
new
coat
which
had
just
come
home
from
the
tailor
s
and
started
for
viger
what
he
said
when
he
found
madame
labrosse
s
he
could
never
distinctly
remember
the
first
impression
he
received
after
a
return
of
consciousness
was
of
a
bird
singing
very
loudly
that
it
seemed
as
if
its
cage
was
his
head
and
that
in
addition
to
singing
it
was
beating
against
the
bars
he
was
less
nervous
the
next
time
he
came
and
the
oftener
he
came
the
more
he
wondered
at
the
sweetness
of
josephine
s
face
at
last
he
grew
dumb
with
admiration
he
is
very
quiet
this
victor
of
mamma
said
josephine
consciously
does
he
never
say
a
why
now
what
does
he
say
mamma
how
can
i
remember
well
try
he
said
that
now
the
leaves
were
on
the
trees
he
could
not
see
so
far
as
he
used
to
that
before
he
could
see
our
house
from
the
côte
rouge
but
not
well
and
what
else
mamma
how
can
i
remember
he
said
that
the
birds
had
their
nests
all
built
now
he
said
that
he
wondered
if
any
birds
boarded
out
that
he
had
boarded
out
for
ten
years
mamma
what
are
you
laughing
at
how
cruel
my
little
josé
the
dear
timid
one
is
in
mamma
with
whom
how
can
i
tell
i
think
he
will
tell
you
some
but
the
some
day
seemed
to
recede
and
all
the
days
of
may
had
gone
and
june
had
begun
and
still
josephine
did
not
know
victor
grew
more
timid
than
ever
josephine
thought
a
great
deal
about
his
silence
and
once
her
mother
caught
her
blushing
when
he
chanced
to
stir
in
his
chair
she
intended
to
ask
her
about
it
but
her
memory
was
completely
unhinged
by
a
letter
she
received
it
was
evidently
written
with
great
labor
and
it
caused
the
greatest
excitement
in
the
house
mon
dieu
madame
labrosse
exclaimed
françois
xavier
comes
to
dine
and
preparations
were
at
once
commenced
for
the
reception
of
this
françois
xavier
who
was
madame
labrosse
s
favorite
cousin
his
full
name
was
françois
xavier
beaugrand
de
champagne
he
had
just
come
down
from
his
winter
s
work
up
the
river
and
on
the
morning
of
the
day
he
was
to
dine
with
his
cousin
he
stood
leaning
against
the
brick
wall
of
a
small
hotel
in
the
suburbs
the
sunlight
was
streaming
down
on
him
reflected
up
from
the
pavement
and
back
from
the
house
and
he
basked
in
the
heat
with
his
eyes
half
shut
his
face
was
burned
to
a
fiery
brown
but
as
he
had
just
lost
his
full
beard
his
chin
was
a
sort
of
he
was
evidently
dressed
with
great
care
in
a
completely
new
outfit
he
appeared
as
if
forced
into
a
suit
of
cloth
on
his
feet
he
wore
a
tight
pair
of
low
shoes
with
high
heels
and
red
socks
his
arms
protruded
from
his
showing
a
glimpse
of
white
cuffs
and
a
flash
of
red
his
necktie
was
a
remarkable
arrangement
of
red
and
blue
silks
mixed
with
brass
rings
on
his
head
he
wore
a
large
soft
felt
hat
he
had
little
gold
in
his
ears
and
a
large
ring
on
his
finger
as
he
leaned
against
the
wall
he
had
thrust
his
fingers
into
his
pockets
and
the
sun
had
eased
him
into
a
sort
of
gloomy
doze
for
he
knew
he
had
to
go
to
madame
labrosse
s
for
dinner
and
he
was
not
entirely
willing
to
leave
his
pleasures
in
the
first
flush
of
their
novelty
he
had
made
arrangements
to
break
away
from
the
restraint
early
in
the
evening
which
softened
his
displeasure
somewhat
but
when
his
friends
came
for
him
he
was
loath
to
go
how
beautiful
josephine
had
grown
how
kind
that
cousin
was
and
how
quickly
the
time
went
dinner
now
tea
and
who
is
this
that
comes
in
after
tea
this
is
victor
lucier
and
who
is
this
that
sits
so
cheerfully
filling
half
the
room
with
his
hugeness
this
is
françois
xavier
beaugrand
de
champagne
he
has
just
returned
just
returned
just
returned
from
where
what
right
has
he
to
return
who
is
this
françois
xavier
who
returns
suddenly
and
fills
the
whole
room
can
it
be
so
a
vague
feeling
of
jealousy
springs
up
in
victor
can
this
be
the
one
of
josephine
s
choosing
yes
true
it
is
he
calls
her
josé
just
like
madame
labrosse
but
he
is
going
now
and
he
is
very
loath
to
go
but
he
will
be
back
some
day
soon
and
off
he
goes
and
by
and
by
away
goes
madame
labrosse
just
for
a
moment
she
says
they
are
alone
now
as
they
have
never
been
before
josephine
sits
with
the
blood
coming
into
her
face
wondering
what
victor
will
say
victor
also
wonders
what
he
will
say
josephine
s
bird
gives
a
faint
sleepy
twitter
they
both
look
up
then
he
hops
down
from
his
perch
and
pecks
at
his
suddenly
he
gives
a
few
sharp
cries
as
if
to
try
his
voice
they
both
start
to
their
feet
now
he
commences
to
sing
what
a
burst
of
rapture
in
a
moment
josephine
is
in
victor
s
arms
her
cheek
is
against
the
velvet
coat
is
it
her
own
heart
she
hears
or
is
it
victor
s
no
need
of
words
now
how
the
bird
sings
high
and
clear
he
shakes
out
his
song
in
a
passionate
burst
as
if
all
his
life
were
for
love
and
they
seem
to
talk
together
in
sweet
unsaid
words
until
he
ceases
now
they
are
seated
on
the
sofa
and
madame
labrosse
comes
in
josephine
mamma
how
can
i
help
it
and
the
tears
of
joy
creep
out
on
her
eyelashes
suddenly
the
grandmother
catching
sight
through
her
eyes
of
victor
and
josephine
on
the
sofa
cries
out
and
menaces
him
with
her
shrivelled
fist
when
they
all
rush
upon
her
with
kisses
and
pacify
her
with
her
pipe
and
now
what
is
this
noise
that
breaks
the
quiet
it
is
a
wild
song
from
the
street
echoing
in
the
room
there
is
a
shout
and
a
cab
draws
up
at
the
door
it
is
françois
xavier
returned
for
the
second
time
he
stands
swaying
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
there
is
a
vinous
lustre
in
his
eyes
his
coat
is
thrown
back
from
his
shoulder
some
one
has
been
dancing
on
his
hat
for
it
is
all
crushed
and
dusty
he
mutters
the
words
of
the
song
which
the
chorus
is
roaring
c
est
dans
la
vill
de
madame
labrosse
implores
him
with
words
to
come
some
other
time
josephine
implores
him
with
her
eyes
clinging
to
victor
who
has
his
arm
around
her
but
françois
xavier
stands
unimpressed
suddenly
he
makes
an
advance
on
josephine
who
retreats
behind
victor
scoundrel
base
one
calls
out
victor
leave
the
house
or
i
myself
will
put
you
out
françois
xavier
gazes
for
a
moment
on
the
little
figure
peering
at
him
so
fiercely
through
his
spectacles
then
as
the
chorus
lulls
for
a
moment
a
smile
of
childish
tenderness
mantles
all
his
face
and
with
the
gesture
of
a
father
reclaiming
his
son
he
stretches
his
arms
toward
victor
he
folds
him
to
his
breast
and
lifting
him
from
the
floor
despite
his
struggles
he
carries
him
out
into
the
night
where
the
chorus
bursts
out
c
est
dans
la
vill
de
it
is
late
when
victor
at
last
escapes
and
hears
them
go
roaring
away
as
he
flees
hatless
through
the
fields
to
his
home
it
is
still
later
when
he
falls
asleep
overcome
by
excitement
and
the
stimulants
which
have
been
administered
to
him
and
through
his
feverish
dreams
runs
the
sound
of
singing
of
josephine
s
voice
inexpressibly
sweet
and
tender
like
the
voice
of
a
happy
angel
but
the
song
that
she
sings
c
est
dans
la
vill
de
the
pedler
he
used
to
come
in
the
early
when
in
sunny
hollows
banks
of
coarse
snow
lie
thawing
shrinking
with
almost
inaudible
tinklings
when
the
upper
are
covered
thickly
with
the
film
left
by
the
melted
snow
when
the
old
leaves
about
the
gray
trees
are
wet
and
sodden
when
the
pools
lie
bare
and
clear
without
grasses
very
limpid
with
when
the
swollen
streams
rush
insolently
by
when
the
grosbeaks
try
the
cedar
buds
shyly
and
a
colony
of
little
birds
take
a
sunny
tree
slope
and
sing
songs
there
he
used
to
come
with
the
awakening
of
life
in
the
woods
with
the
strange
cohosh
and
the
violet
piercing
the
damp
leaf
which
it
would
wear
as
a
ruff
about
its
neck
in
blossom
time
he
used
to
come
up
the
road
from
valérie
trudging
heavily
bearing
his
packs
to
most
of
the
viger
people
he
seemed
to
appear
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
street
clothed
with
power
and
surrounded
by
an
attentive
crowd
of
boys
and
a
whirling
fringe
of
dogs
barking
and
throwing
up
dust
i
speak
of
what
has
become
tradition
for
the
pedler
walks
no
more
up
the
valérie
road
bearing
those
magical
baskets
of
his
there
was
something
powerful
compelling
about
him
his
short
heavy
figure
his
expressionless
face
the
quick
hands
in
which
he
seemed
to
weigh
everything
that
he
touched
his
voluminous
indescribable
clothes
the
great
umbrella
he
carried
strapped
to
his
back
the
green
spectacles
that
hid
his
eyes
all
these
commanded
attention
but
his
powers
seemed
to
lie
in
those
inscrutable
guards
to
his
eyes
they
were
such
goggles
as
are
commonly
used
by
threshers
and
were
bound
firmly
about
his
face
by
a
leather
lace
with
their
setting
of
iron
they
completely
covered
his
not
permitting
a
glimpse
of
those
eyes
that
seemed
to
glare
out
of
their
depths
they
seemed
never
to
have
been
removed
but
to
have
grown
there
rooted
by
time
in
his
he
carried
a
large
covered
with
oiled
cloth
slung
to
his
shoulder
by
a
strap
in
one
hand
he
carried
a
light
stick
in
the
other
a
large
oval
bandbox
of
black
shiny
cloth
from
the
initials
j
which
appeared
in
faded
white
letters
on
the
bandbox
the
village
people
had
christened
him
coming
into
the
village
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
road
set
his
bandbox
between
his
feet
and
took
the
oiled
cloth
from
the
basket
he
never
went
from
house
to
house
his
customers
came
to
him
he
stood
there
and
sold
almost
without
a
word
as
calm
as
a
sphinx
and
as
powerful
there
was
something
compelling
about
him
the
people
bought
things
they
did
not
want
but
they
had
to
buy
the
goods
lay
before
them
the
handkerchiefs
the
laces
the
jewelry
the
little
sacred
pictures
matches
in
colored
boxes
little
cased
combs
pins
and
and
over
all
this
figure
with
the
inscrutable
eyes
as
he
took
in
the
money
and
made
change
he
uttered
the
word
good
continually
good
there
was
something
exciting
in
the
way
he
pronounced
that
word
something
that
goaded
the
hearers
into
extravagance
it
happened
one
day
in
april
when
the
weather
was
doubtful
and
moody
and
storms
flew
low
scattering
cold
rain
and
after
that
day
the
pedler
was
a
shape
in
memory
a
fact
no
longer
he
was
blown
into
the
village
unwetted
by
a
shower
that
left
the
streets
untouched
and
that
went
through
the
northern
fields
sharply
and
lost
itself
in
the
far
woods
he
stopped
in
front
of
the
the
widow
laroque
slammed
her
door
and
went
upstairs
to
peep
through
the
curtain
these
pedlers
spoiled
trade
she
said
and
hated
them
in
consequence
soon
a
crowd
collected
and
great
talk
arose
with
laughter
and
some
jostling
every
one
tried
to
see
into
the
basket
those
behind
stood
on
tiptoe
and
asked
questions
those
in
front
held
the
crowd
back
and
tried
to
look
at
the
goods
the
air
was
full
of
the
staccato
of
surprise
and
admiration
the
late
comers
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
commenced
to
jostle
and
somebody
tossed
a
handful
of
dust
into
the
air
over
the
group
what
a
wretched
wind
cried
some
one
it
blows
all
the
dust
seemed
to
irritate
the
pedler
besides
no
one
had
bought
anything
he
called
out
sharply
he
sold
two
papers
of
a
little
brass
shrine
of
la
bonne
anne
a
colored
handkerchief
a
horn
comb
and
a
while
these
purchases
were
going
on
henri
lamoureux
was
eying
the
little
red
purses
and
fingering
a
coin
in
his
pocket
the
coin
was
a
doubtful
one
and
he
was
weighing
carefully
the
chances
of
passing
it
at
last
he
said
carelessly
how
much
touching
the
purses
the
pedler
s
answer
called
out
the
coin
from
his
pocket
it
lay
in
the
man
s
hand
henri
took
the
purse
and
moved
hurriedly
back
at
once
the
pedler
grasped
after
him
reaching
as
well
as
his
basket
would
allow
he
caught
him
by
the
coat
but
henri
s
dog
darted
in
nipped
the
pedler
s
leg
and
got
away
showing
his
teeth
lamoureux
struggled
the
pedler
swore
in
a
moment
every
one
was
jostling
to
get
out
of
the
way
wondering
what
was
the
matter
as
henri
swung
his
arm
around
he
swept
his
hand
across
the
pedler
s
eyes
the
gave
way
and
the
green
goggles
fell
into
the
basket
then
a
curious
change
came
over
the
man
he
let
his
enemy
go
and
stood
dazed
for
a
moment
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
and
in
that
interval
of
quiet
the
people
saw
where
they
expected
to
see
flash
the
two
rapacious
eyes
of
their
imaginings
only
the
seared
fleshy
seams
where
those
eyes
should
have
been
that
was
the
vision
of
a
moment
for
the
pedler
like
a
fiend
in
fury
threw
up
his
long
arms
and
cursed
in
a
voice
so
powerful
and
sudden
that
the
dismayed
crowd
shrunk
away
clinging
to
one
another
and
looking
over
their
shoulders
at
the
violent
figure
god
have
mercy
anne
protect
us
curses
his
baptism
screamed
the
women
in
a
second
he
was
alone
the
dog
that
had
assailed
him
was
snarling
from
under
the
sidewalk
and
the
women
were
in
the
nearest
houses
henri
lamoureux
in
the
nearest
lane
stood
pale
with
a
stone
in
his
hand
it
was
only
for
one
moment
in
the
second
the
pedler
had
gathered
his
things
blind
as
he
was
had
turned
his
back
and
was
striding
up
the
street
in
the
third
one
of
the
sudden
storms
had
gathered
the
dust
at
the
end
of
the
village
and
came
down
with
it
driving
every
one
indoors
it
shrouded
the
retreating
figure
and
a
crack
of
unexpected
thunder
came
like
a
pistol
shot
and
then
the
pelting
rain
some
venturesome
souls
who
looked
out
when
the
storm
was
nearly
over
declared
they
saw
large
on
the
hills
the
figure
of
the
pedler
walking
enraged
in
the
fringes
of
the
storm
one
of
these
was
henri
lamoureux
who
to
this
day
has
never
found
the
little
red
purse
i
would
have
sworn
i
had
it
in
this
hand
when
he
caught
me
but
i
felt
it
fly
away
like
a
but
what
made
the
man
curse
every
one
so
when
you
just
bought
that
little
that
well
i
know
not
do
you
anyway
he
has
my
quarter
and
he
was
as
a
stone
blind
not
he
cried
the
widow
laroque
he
was
the
old
boy
himself
i
told
is
always
as
i
say
you
see
was
the
old
devil
however
that
might
be
there
are
yet
people
in
viger
who
when
the
dust
blows
and
a
sharp
storm
comes
up
from
the
southeast
see
the
figure
of
the
enraged
pedler
large
upon
the
hills
striding
violently
along
the
fringes
of
the
storm
paul
farlotte
near
the
outskirts
of
viger
to
the
west
far
away
from
the
blanche
but
having
a
country
outlook
of
their
own
and
a
glimpse
of
a
shadowy
range
of
hills
stood
two
houses
which
would
have
attracted
attention
by
their
contrast
if
for
no
other
reason
one
was
a
low
cottage
surrounded
by
a
garden
and
covered
with
roses
which
formed
jalousies
for
the
encircling
veranda
the
garden
was
laid
out
with
the
care
and
completeness
that
told
of
a
master
hand
the
cottage
itself
had
the
air
of
having
been
secured
from
the
inroads
of
time
as
thoroughly
as
paint
and
a
nail
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
could
effect
that
end
the
other
was
a
large
house
narrow
and
high
with
many
windows
some
of
which
were
boarded
up
as
if
there
was
no
further
use
for
the
chambers
into
which
they
had
once
admitted
light
standing
on
a
rough
piece
of
ground
it
seemed
given
over
to
the
rudeness
of
decay
it
appeared
to
have
been
the
intention
of
its
builder
to
veneer
it
with
brick
but
it
stood
there
a
wooden
shell
discolored
by
the
weather
disjointed
by
the
frost
and
with
the
wind
fluttering
the
rags
of
which
had
been
intended
as
a
protection
against
the
cold
but
which
now
hung
in
patches
and
ribbons
but
despite
this
dilapidation
it
had
a
sort
of
martial
air
about
it
and
seemed
to
watch
over
its
embowered
companion
warding
off
tempests
and
gradually
falling
to
pieces
on
guard
like
a
faithful
soldier
who
suffers
at
his
post
in
the
road
just
between
the
two
stood
a
beautiful
lombardy
poplar
its
shadow
fell
upon
the
little
cottage
in
the
morning
and
travelled
across
the
garden
and
in
the
evening
touched
the
corner
of
the
tall
house
and
faded
out
with
the
sun
only
to
float
there
again
in
the
moonlight
or
to
commence
the
journey
next
morning
with
the
dawn
this
shadow
seemed
with
its
constant
movement
to
figure
the
connection
that
existed
between
the
two
houses
the
garden
of
the
cottage
was
a
marvel
there
the
finest
roses
in
the
parish
grew
roses
which
people
came
miles
to
see
and
parterres
of
flowers
the
seed
of
which
came
from
france
and
which
in
consequence
seemed
to
blow
with
a
rarer
color
and
more
delicate
perfume
this
garden
was
a
striking
contrast
to
the
stony
ground
about
the
neighboring
house
where
only
the
commonest
weeds
grew
unregarded
but
its
master
had
been
born
a
gardener
just
as
another
man
is
born
a
musician
or
a
poet
there
was
a
superstition
in
the
village
that
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
put
anything
even
a
dry
stick
into
the
ground
and
it
would
grow
he
was
the
village
schoolmaster
and
madame
laroque
would
remark
spitefully
enough
that
if
monsieur
paul
farlotte
had
been
as
successful
in
planting
knowledge
in
the
heads
of
his
scholars
as
he
was
in
planting
roses
in
his
garden
viger
would
have
been
celebrated
the
world
over
but
he
was
born
a
gardener
not
a
teacher
and
he
made
the
best
of
the
fate
which
compelled
him
to
depend
for
his
living
on
something
he
disliked
he
looked
almost
as
dry
as
one
of
his
own
hyacinth
bulbs
but
like
it
he
had
life
at
his
heart
he
was
a
very
small
man
and
frail
and
looked
older
than
he
was
it
was
strange
but
you
rarely
seemed
to
see
his
face
for
he
was
bent
with
weeding
and
digging
and
it
seemed
an
effort
for
him
to
raise
his
head
and
look
at
you
with
the
full
glance
of
his
eye
but
when
he
did
you
saw
the
eye
was
honest
and
full
of
light
he
was
not
careful
of
his
personal
appearance
clinging
to
his
old
garments
with
a
fondness
which
often
laid
him
open
to
ridicule
which
he
was
willing
to
bear
for
the
sake
of
the
comfort
of
an
old
pair
of
shoes
or
a
hat
which
had
accommodated
itself
to
the
irregularities
of
his
head
on
the
street
he
wore
a
curious
that
seemed
to
be
made
of
some
indestructible
material
for
he
had
worn
it
for
years
and
might
be
buried
in
it
it
received
an
extra
brush
for
sundays
and
holidays
and
always
looked
as
good
as
new
he
made
a
quaint
picture
as
he
came
down
the
road
from
the
school
he
had
a
hesitating
walk
and
constantly
stopped
and
looked
behind
him
for
he
always
fancied
he
heard
a
voice
calling
him
by
his
name
he
would
be
working
in
his
when
he
would
hear
it
over
his
shoulder
paul
or
when
he
went
to
draw
water
from
his
well
paul
or
when
he
was
reading
by
his
fire
some
one
calling
him
softly
paul
paul
or
in
the
dead
of
night
when
nothing
moved
in
his
cottage
he
would
hear
it
out
of
the
dark
so
it
came
to
be
a
sort
of
companionship
for
him
this
haunting
voice
and
sometimes
one
could
have
seen
him
in
his
garden
stretch
out
his
hand
and
smile
as
if
he
were
welcoming
an
invisible
guest
sometimes
the
guest
was
not
invisible
but
took
body
and
shape
and
was
a
real
presence
and
often
paul
was
greeted
with
visions
of
things
that
had
been
or
that
would
be
and
saw
figures
where
for
other
eyes
hung
only
the
impalpable
air
he
had
one
other
passion
besides
his
garden
and
that
was
montaigne
he
delved
in
one
in
the
summer
in
the
other
in
the
winter
with
his
feet
on
his
stove
he
would
become
so
absorbed
with
his
author
that
he
would
burn
his
slippers
and
come
to
himself
disturbed
by
the
smell
of
the
singed
leather
he
had
only
one
great
ambition
that
was
to
return
to
france
to
see
his
mother
before
she
died
and
he
had
for
years
been
trying
to
save
enough
money
to
take
the
journey
people
who
did
not
know
him
called
him
stingy
and
said
the
saving
for
his
journey
was
only
a
pretext
to
cover
his
miserly
habits
it
was
strange
he
had
been
saving
for
years
and
yet
he
had
not
saved
enough
whenever
anyone
would
ask
him
well
monsieur
farlotte
when
do
you
go
to
france
he
would
answer
next
so
when
he
announced
one
spring
that
he
was
actually
going
and
when
people
saw
that
he
was
not
making
his
garden
with
his
accustomed
care
it
became
the
talk
of
the
village
monsieur
farlotte
is
going
to
france
monsieur
farlotte
has
saved
enough
money
true
true
he
is
going
to
his
proposed
visit
gave
no
one
so
much
pleasure
as
it
gave
his
neighbors
in
the
gaunt
unkempt
house
which
seemed
to
watch
over
his
own
and
no
one
would
have
imagined
what
a
joy
it
was
to
marie
denis
the
tall
girl
who
was
mother
to
her
orphan
brothers
and
sisters
to
hear
monsieur
farlotte
say
when
i
am
in
france
for
she
knew
what
none
of
the
villagers
knew
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
and
her
troubles
monsieur
farlotte
would
have
seen
france
many
years
before
how
often
she
would
recall
the
time
when
her
father
who
was
in
the
employ
of
the
great
match
factory
near
viger
used
to
drive
about
collecting
the
little
paper
which
were
made
by
hundreds
of
women
in
the
village
and
the
country
around
how
he
had
conceived
the
idea
of
making
a
machine
in
which
a
strip
of
paper
would
go
in
at
one
end
and
the
completed
would
fall
out
at
the
other
how
he
had
given
up
his
situation
and
devoted
his
whole
time
and
energy
to
the
invention
of
this
machine
how
he
had
failed
time
and
again
but
continued
with
a
perseverance
which
at
last
became
a
frantic
passion
and
how
to
keep
the
family
together
her
mother
herself
and
the
children
joined
that
army
of
workers
which
was
making
the
by
hand
she
would
think
of
what
would
have
happened
to
them
then
if
monsieur
farlotte
had
not
been
there
with
his
help
or
what
would
have
happened
when
her
mother
died
worn
out
and
her
father
overcome
with
disappointment
gave
up
his
life
and
his
task
together
in
despair
but
whenever
she
would
try
to
speak
of
these
things
monsieur
farlotte
would
prevent
her
with
a
gesture
well
but
what
would
you
have
me
do
i
will
go
some
day
who
knows
next
year
so
here
was
the
next
year
which
she
had
so
longed
to
see
and
monsieur
farlotte
was
giving
her
a
daily
lecture
on
how
to
treat
the
tulips
after
they
had
done
flowering
preluding
everything
he
had
to
say
with
when
i
am
in
france
for
his
heart
was
already
there
he
had
two
places
to
visit
one
was
his
old
home
the
other
was
the
birthplace
of
his
beloved
montaigne
he
had
often
described
to
marie
the
little
cottage
where
he
was
born
with
the
vine
arbors
and
the
long
garden
walks
the
with
their
cool
leaves
the
white
eaves
where
the
swallows
nested
and
the
poplar
sentinel
over
all
you
see
he
would
say
i
have
tried
to
make
this
little
place
like
it
and
my
memory
may
have
played
me
a
trick
but
i
often
fancy
myself
at
home
that
poplar
and
this
long
walk
and
the
vines
on
the
arbor
when
i
see
the
tulips
by
the
border
i
fancy
it
is
all
in
marie
was
going
over
his
scant
wardrobe
mending
with
her
skilful
fingers
putting
a
stitch
in
the
trusty
old
coat
and
securing
its
buttons
she
was
anxious
that
monsieur
farlotte
should
get
a
new
suit
before
he
went
on
his
journey
but
he
would
not
hear
to
it
not
a
bit
of
it
he
would
say
if
i
made
my
appearance
in
a
new
suit
they
would
think
i
had
been
making
money
and
when
they
would
find
out
that
i
had
not
enough
to
buy
cabbage
for
the
soup
there
would
be
a
she
could
not
get
him
to
write
that
he
was
coming
no
no
he
would
say
if
i
do
that
they
will
expect
well
and
why
not
not
well
they
would
think
about
it
ten
days
paul
comes
home
then
in
five
days
paul
comes
home
and
then
when
i
came
they
would
set
the
dogs
on
me
no
i
will
just
walk
in
when
they
are
staring
at
my
old
coat
i
will
just
sit
down
in
a
corner
and
my
old
mother
will
commence
to
cry
oh
i
have
it
all
so
marie
let
him
have
his
own
way
but
she
was
fixed
on
having
her
way
in
some
things
to
save
monsieur
farlotte
the
heavier
work
and
allow
him
to
keep
his
strength
for
the
journey
she
would
make
her
brother
guy
do
the
spading
in
the
garden
much
to
his
disgust
and
that
of
monsieur
farlotte
who
would
stand
by
and
interfere
taking
the
spade
into
his
own
hands
with
infinite
satisfaction
see
he
would
say
go
deeper
and
turn
it
over
and
when
guy
would
dig
in
his
own
clumsy
way
he
would
go
off
in
despair
with
the
words
god
help
us
nothing
will
grow
when
monsieur
farlotte
insisted
on
taking
his
clothes
in
an
old
box
covered
with
rawhide
with
his
initials
in
brass
tacks
on
the
cover
marie
would
not
consent
to
it
and
made
guy
carry
off
the
box
without
his
knowledge
and
hide
it
she
had
a
good
tin
trunk
which
had
belonged
to
her
mother
which
she
knew
where
to
find
in
the
attic
and
which
would
contain
everything
monsieur
farlotte
had
to
carry
poor
marie
never
went
into
this
attic
without
a
shudder
for
occupying
most
of
the
space
was
her
father
s
work
bench
and
that
complicated
wheel
the
model
of
his
invention
which
he
had
tried
so
hard
to
perfect
and
which
stood
there
like
a
monument
of
his
failure
she
had
made
guy
promise
never
to
move
it
fearing
lest
he
might
be
tempted
to
finish
what
his
father
had
begun
fear
that
was
almost
an
apprehension
so
like
him
was
he
growing
he
was
tall
and
with
a
dark
restless
eye
set
under
an
overhanging
forehead
he
had
long
arms
out
of
proportion
to
his
height
and
he
hung
his
head
when
he
walked
his
likeness
to
his
father
made
him
seem
a
man
before
his
time
he
felt
himself
a
man
for
he
had
a
good
position
in
the
match
factory
and
was
like
a
father
to
his
little
brothers
and
sisters
although
the
model
had
always
had
a
strange
fascination
for
him
the
lad
had
kept
his
promise
to
his
sister
and
had
never
touched
the
mechanism
which
had
literally
taken
his
father
s
life
often
when
he
went
into
the
attic
he
would
stand
and
gaze
at
the
model
and
wonder
why
it
had
not
succeeded
and
recall
his
father
bending
over
his
work
with
his
compass
and
pencil
but
he
had
a
dread
of
it
too
and
sometimes
would
hurry
away
afraid
lest
its
fascination
would
conquer
him
monsieur
farlotte
was
to
leave
as
soon
as
his
school
closed
but
weeks
before
that
he
had
everything
ready
and
could
enjoy
his
roses
in
peace
after
school
hours
he
would
walk
in
his
garden
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
meditating
and
once
in
a
while
he
would
pause
and
smile
or
look
over
his
shoulder
when
the
haunting
voice
would
call
his
name
his
scholars
had
commenced
to
view
him
with
additional
interest
now
that
he
was
going
to
take
such
a
prodigious
journey
and
two
or
three
of
them
could
always
be
seen
peering
through
the
palings
watching
him
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
path
and
marie
would
watch
him
too
and
wonder
what
he
would
say
when
he
found
that
his
trunk
had
disappeared
he
missed
it
fully
a
month
before
he
could
expect
to
start
but
he
had
resolved
to
pack
that
very
evening
but
there
is
plenty
of
time
remonstrated
marie
that
s
always
the
way
he
answered
would
you
expect
me
to
leave
everything
until
the
last
moment
but
monsieur
farlotte
in
ten
minutes
everything
goes
into
the
so
and
in
the
same
ten
minutes
something
is
left
out
of
the
trunk
and
i
am
in
france
and
my
shoes
are
in
viger
that
will
be
the
end
of
so
to
pacify
him
she
had
to
ask
guy
to
bring
down
the
trunk
from
the
attic
it
was
not
yet
dark
there
the
sunset
threw
a
great
color
into
the
room
touching
all
the
familiar
objects
with
transfiguring
light
and
giving
the
shadows
a
rich
depth
guy
saw
the
model
glowing
like
some
magic
golden
wheel
the
metal
points
upon
it
gleaming
like
jewels
in
the
light
as
he
passed
he
touched
it
and
with
a
musical
click
something
dropped
from
it
he
picked
it
up
it
was
one
of
the
little
paper
but
the
defect
that
he
remembered
to
have
heard
talked
of
was
there
he
held
it
in
his
hand
and
examined
it
then
he
pulled
it
apart
and
spread
it
out
ah
he
said
to
himself
the
fault
was
in
the
then
he
turned
the
wheel
and
one
by
one
the
imperfect
boxes
dropped
out
until
the
strip
of
paper
was
exhausted
but
why
question
rose
in
his
mind
why
could
not
that
little
difficulty
be
overcome
he
took
the
trunk
down
to
marie
who
at
last
persuaded
monsieur
farlotte
to
let
her
pack
his
clothes
in
it
he
did
so
with
a
protestation
well
i
know
how
it
will
be
with
a
fine
box
like
that
some
fellow
will
whip
it
off
when
i
am
looking
the
other
way
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
as
soon
as
he
could
do
so
without
attracting
marie
s
attention
guy
returned
to
the
attic
with
a
lamp
when
marie
had
finished
packing
monsieur
farlotte
s
wardrobe
she
went
home
to
put
her
children
to
bed
but
when
she
saw
that
light
in
the
attic
window
she
nearly
fainted
from
apprehension
when
she
pushed
open
the
door
of
that
room
which
she
had
entered
so
often
with
the
scant
meals
she
used
to
bring
her
father
she
saw
guy
bending
over
the
model
examining
every
part
of
it
guy
she
said
trying
to
command
her
voice
you
have
broken
your
he
looked
up
quickly
marie
i
am
going
to
find
it
can
understand
is
just
one
thing
if
i
can
get
that
we
will
make
a
fortune
out
of
guy
don
t
delude
yourself
those
were
father
s
words
and
day
after
day
i
brought
him
his
meals
here
when
he
was
too
busy
even
to
come
downstairs
but
nothing
came
of
it
and
while
he
was
trying
to
make
a
machine
for
the
boxes
we
were
making
them
with
our
fingers
o
guy
she
cried
with
her
voice
rising
into
a
sob
remember
those
days
remember
what
monsieur
farlotte
did
for
us
and
what
he
would
have
to
do
again
if
you
lost
your
place
that
s
all
nonsense
marie
two
weeks
will
do
it
and
after
that
i
could
send
monsieur
farlotte
home
with
a
pocket
full
of
guy
you
are
making
a
terrible
mistake
that
wheel
was
our
curse
and
it
will
follow
us
if
you
don
t
leave
it
alone
and
think
of
monsieur
farlotte
if
he
finds
out
what
you
are
working
at
he
will
not
go
to
know
him
he
will
believe
it
his
duty
to
stay
here
and
help
us
as
he
did
when
father
was
alive
guy
guy
listen
to
me
but
guy
was
bending
over
the
model
absorbed
in
its
labyrinths
in
vain
did
marie
argue
with
him
try
to
persuade
him
and
threaten
him
she
attempted
to
lock
the
attic
door
and
keep
him
out
but
he
twisted
the
lock
off
and
after
that
the
door
was
always
open
then
she
resolved
to
break
the
wheel
into
a
thousand
pieces
but
when
she
went
upstairs
when
guy
was
away
she
could
not
strike
it
with
the
axe
she
held
it
seemed
like
a
human
thing
that
cried
out
with
a
hundred
tongues
against
the
murder
she
would
do
and
she
could
only
sink
down
sobbing
and
pray
then
failing
everything
else
she
simulated
an
interest
in
the
thing
and
tried
to
lead
guy
to
work
at
it
moderately
and
not
to
give
up
his
whole
time
to
it
but
he
seemed
to
take
up
his
father
s
passion
where
he
had
laid
it
down
marie
could
do
nothing
with
him
and
the
younger
children
at
first
hanging
around
the
attic
door
as
if
he
were
their
father
come
back
again
gradually
ventured
into
the
room
and
whispered
together
as
they
watched
their
rapt
and
unobservant
brother
working
at
his
task
marie
s
one
thought
was
to
devise
a
means
of
keeping
the
fact
from
monsieur
farlotte
and
she
told
him
blankly
that
guy
had
been
sent
away
on
business
and
would
not
be
back
for
six
weeks
she
hoped
that
by
that
time
monsieur
farlotte
would
be
safely
started
on
his
journey
but
night
after
night
he
saw
a
light
in
the
attic
window
in
the
past
years
it
had
been
constant
there
and
he
could
only
connect
it
with
one
cause
but
he
could
get
no
answer
from
marie
when
he
asked
her
the
reason
and
the
next
night
the
distracted
girl
draped
the
window
so
that
no
ray
of
light
could
find
its
way
out
into
the
night
but
monsieur
farlotte
was
not
satisfied
and
a
few
evenings
afterwards
as
it
was
growing
dusk
he
went
quietly
into
the
house
and
upstairs
into
the
attic
there
he
saw
guy
stretched
along
the
work
bench
his
head
in
his
hands
using
the
last
light
to
ponder
over
a
sketch
he
was
making
and
beside
him
figured
very
clearly
in
the
thick
gold
air
of
the
sunset
the
form
of
his
father
bending
over
him
with
the
old
eager
haggard
look
in
his
eyes
monsieur
farlotte
watched
the
two
figures
for
a
moment
as
they
glowed
in
their
rich
atmosphere
then
the
apparition
turned
his
head
slowly
and
warned
him
away
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
all
night
long
monsieur
farlotte
walked
in
his
garden
patient
and
undisturbed
fixing
his
duty
so
that
nothing
could
root
it
out
he
found
the
comfort
that
comes
to
those
who
give
up
some
exceeding
deep
desire
of
the
heart
and
when
next
morning
the
from
valérie
driving
by
as
the
matin
bell
was
clanging
from
joseph
s
and
seeing
the
old
teacher
as
if
he
were
taking
an
early
look
at
his
growing
roses
asked
him
well
monsieur
farlotte
when
do
you
go
to
france
he
was
able
to
answer
cheerfully
next
marie
could
not
unfix
his
determination
no
he
said
they
do
not
expect
me
no
one
will
be
disappointed
i
am
too
old
to
travel
i
might
be
lost
in
the
sea
until
guy
makes
his
invention
we
must
not
be
at
first
the
villagers
thought
that
he
was
only
joking
and
that
they
would
some
morning
wake
up
and
find
him
gone
but
when
the
holidays
came
and
when
enough
time
had
elapsed
for
him
to
make
his
journey
twice
over
they
began
to
think
he
was
in
earnest
when
they
knew
that
guy
denis
was
chained
to
his
father
s
invention
and
when
they
saw
that
marie
and
the
children
had
commenced
to
make
again
they
shook
their
heads
some
of
them
at
least
seemed
to
understand
why
monsieur
farlotte
had
not
gone
to
france
but
he
never
repined
he
took
up
his
garden
again
was
as
contented
as
ever
and
comforted
himself
with
the
wisdom
of
montaigne
the
people
dropped
the
old

more
often

figures
in
the
air
that
no
one
else
could
see
early
one
morning
as
he
was
working
in
his
garden
around
a
growing
he
fell
into
a
sort
of
stupor
and
sinking
down
quietly
on
his
knees
he
leaned
against
the
slender
stem
for
support
he
saw
a
garden
much
like
his
own
flooded
with
the
clear
sunlight
in
the
shade
of
an
arbor
an
old
woman
in
a
white
cap
was
leaning
back
in
a
wheeled
chair
her
eyes
were
closed
she
seemed
asleep
a
young
woman
was
seated
beside
her
holding
her
hand
suddenly
the
old
woman
smiled
a
childish
smile
as
if
she
were
well
pleased

the
young
woman
fell
on
her
knees
and
wept
hiding
her
face

the
aged
face
was
inexpressibly
calm
in
the
shadow
with
the
smile
lingering
upon
it
fixed
by
the
deeper
sleep
into
which
she
had
fallen
gradually

faded
away
