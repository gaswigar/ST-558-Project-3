conan

his

the
stillness
of
the
forest
trail
was
so
primeval
that
the
tread
of
a
foot
was
a
startling
disturbance
at
least
it
seemed
so
to
the
ears
of
the
wayfarer
though
he
was
moving
along
the
path
with
the
caution
that
must
be
practised
by
any
man
who
ventures
beyond
thunder
river
he
was
a
young
man
of
medium
height
with
an
open
countenance
and
a
mop
of
tousled
tawny
hair
unconfined
by
cap
or
helmet
his
garb
was
common
enough
for
that
country
a
coarse
tunic
belted
at
the
waist
short
leather
breeches
beneath
and
soft
buckskin
boots
that
came
short
of
the
knee
a
jutted
from
one
the
broad
leather
belt
supported
a
short
heavy
sword
and
a
buckskin
pouch
there
was
no
perturbation
in
the
wide
eyes
that
scanned
the
green
walls
which
fringed
the
trail
though
not
tall
he
was
well
built
and
the
arms
that
the
short
wide
sleeves
of
the
tunic
left
bare
were
thick
with
corded
muscle
he
tramped
imperturbably
along
although
the
last
settler
cabin
lay
miles
behind
him
and
each
step
was
carrying
him
nearer
the
grim
peril
that
hung
like
a
brooding
shadow
over
the
ancient
forest
he
was
not
making
as
much
noise
as
it
seemed
to
him
though
he
well
knew
that
the
faint
tread
of
his
booted
feet
would
be
like
a
tocsin
of
alarm
to
the
fierce
ears
that
might
be
lurking
in
the
treacherous
green
fastness
his
careless
attitude
was
not
genuine
his
eyes
and
ears
were
keenly
alert
especially
his
ears
for
no
gaze
could
penetrate
the
leafy
tangle
for
more
than
a
few
feet
in
either
direction
but
it
was
instinct
more
than
any
warning
by
the
external
senses
which
brought
him
up
suddenly
his
hand
on
his
hilt
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
trail
unconsciously
holding
his
breath
wondering
what
he
had
heard
and
wondering
if
indeed
he
had
heard
anything
the
silence
seemed
absolute
not
a
squirrel
chattered
or
bird
chirped
then
his
gaze
fixed
itself
on
a
mass
of
bushes
beside
the
trail
a
few
yards
ahead
of
him
there
was
no
breeze
yet
he
had
seen
a
branch
quiver
the
short
hairs
on
his
scalp
prickled
and
he
stood
for
an
instant
undecided
certain
that
a
move
in
either
direction
would
bring
death
streaking
at
him
from
the
bushes
a
heavy
chopping
crunch
sounded
behind
the
leaves
the
bushes
were
shaken
violently
and
simultaneously
with
the
sound
an
arrow
arched
erratically
from
among
them
and
vanished
among
the
trees
along
the
trail
the
wayfarer
glimpsed
its
flight
as
he
sprang
frantically
to
cover
crouching
behind
a
thick
stem
his
sword
quivering
in
his
fingers
he
saw
the
bushes
part
and
a
tall
figure
stepped
leisurely
into
the
trail
the
traveler
stared
in
surprise
the
stranger
was
clad
like
himself
in
regard
to
boots
and
breeks
though
the
latter
were
of
silk
instead
of
leather
but
he
wore
a
sleeveless
hauberk
of
dark
in
place
of
a
tunic
and
a
helmet
perched
on
his
black
mane
that
helmet
held
the
other
gaze
it
was
without
a
crest
but
adorned
by
short
bull
horns
no
civilized
hand
ever
forged
that
nor
was
the
face
below
it
that
of
a
civilized
man
dark
scarred
with
smoldering
blue
eyes
it
was
a
face
untamed
as
the
primordial
forest
which
formed
its
background
the
man
held
a
broadsword
in
his
right
hand
and
the
edge
was
smeared
with
crimson
on
out
he
called
in
an
accent
unfamiliar
to
the
wayfarer
safe
now
there
was
only
one
of
the
dogs
come
on
out
the
other
emerged
dubiously
and
stared
at
the
stranger
he
felt
curiously
helpless
and
futile
as
he
gazed
on
the
proportions
of
the
forest
man
the
massive
breast
and
the
arm
that
bore
the
reddened
sword
burned
dark
by
the
sun
and
ridged
and
corded
with
muscles
he
moved
with
the
dangerous
ease
of
a
panther
he
was
too
fiercely
supple
to
be
a
product
of
civilization
even
of
that
fringe
of
civilization
which
composed
the
outer
frontiers
turning
he
stepped
back
to
the
bushes
and
pulled
them
apart
still
not
certain
just
what
had
happened
the
wayfarer
from
the
east
advanced
and
stared
down
into
the
bushes
a
man
lay
there
a
short
dark
man
naked
except
for
a
a
necklace
of
human
teeth
and
a
brass
armlet
a
short
sword
was
thrust
into
the
girdle
of
the
and
one
hand
still
gripped
a
heavy
black
bow
the
man
had
long
black
hair
that
was
about
all
the
wayfarer
could
tell
about
his
head
for
his
features
were
a
mask
of
blood
and
brains
his
skull
had
been
split
to
the
teeth
pict
by
the
gods
exclaimed
the
wayfarer
the
burning
blue
eyes
turned
upon
him
you
surprised
they
told
me
at
velitrium
and
again
at
the
settlers
cabins
along
the
road
that
these
devils
sometimes
sneaked
across
the
border
but
i
did
expect
to
meet
one
this
far
in
the
interior
only
four
miles
east
of
black
river
the
stranger
informed
him
been
shot
within
a
mile
of
velitrium
no
settler
between
thunder
river
and
fort
tuscelan
is
really
safe
i
picked
up
this
trail
three
miles
south
of
the
fort
this
morning
and
i
been
following
him
ever
since
i
came
up
behind
him
just
as
he
was
drawing
an
arrow
on
you
another
instant
and
there
have
been
a
stranger
in
hell
but
i
spoiled
his
aim
for
him
the
wayfarer
was
staring
at
the
larger
man
dumfounded
by
the
realization
that
the
man
had
actually
tracked
down
one
of
the
and
slain
him
unsuspected
that
implied
woodsmanship
of
a
quality
undreamed
even
for
conajohara
are
one
of
the
fort
garrison
he
asked
no
soldier
i
draw
the
pay
and
rations
of
an
officer
of
the
line
but
i
do
my
work
in
the
woods
valannus
knows
i
of
more
use
ranging
along
the
river
than
cooped
up
in
the
fort
casually
the
slayer
shoved
the
body
deeper
into
the
thickets
with
his
foot
pulled
the
bushes
together
and
turned
away
down
the
trail
the
other
followed
him
name
is
balthus
he
offered
was
at
velitrium
last
night
i
have
decided
whether
i
take
up
a
hide
of
land
or
enter
best
land
near
thunder
river
is
already
taken
grunted
the
slayer
of
good
land
between
scalp
creek
you
crossed
it
a
few
miles
back
and
the
fort
but
that
getting
too
devilish
close
to
the
river
the
picts
steal
over
to
burn
and
murder
as
that
one
did
they
always
come
singly
some
day
they
try
to
sweep
the
settlers
out
of
conajohara
and
they
may
succeed
probably
will
succeed
this
colonization
business
is
mad
anyway
there
plenty
of
good
land
east
of
the
bossonian
marches
if
the
aquilonians
would
cut
up
some
of
the
big
estates
of
their
barons
and
plant
wheat
where
now
only
deer
are
hunted
they
would
have
to
cross
the
border
and
take
the
land
of
the
picts
away
from
them
queer
talk
from
a
man
in
the
service
of
the
governor
of
conajohara
objected
balthus
nothing
to
me
the
other
retorted
a
mercenary
i
sell
my
sword
to
the
highest
bidder
i
never
planted
wheat
and
never
will
so
long
as
there
are
other
harvests
to
be
reaped
with
the
sword
but
you
hyborians
have
expanded
as
far
as
you
be
allowed
to
expand
crossed
the
marches
burned
a
few
villages
exterminated
a
few
clans
and
pushed
back
the
frontier
to
black
river
but
i
doubt
if
you
even
be
able
to
hold
what
you
conquered
and
you
never
push
the
frontier
any
further
westward
your
idiotic
king
does
understand
conditions
here
he
wo
send
you
enough
reinforcements
and
there
are
not
enough
settlers
to
withstand
the
shock
of
a
concerted
attack
from
across
the
river
the
picts
are
divided
into
small
clans
persisted
balthus
never
unite
we
can
whip
any
single
clan
any
three
or
four
clans
admitted
the
slayer
some
day
a
man
will
rise
and
unite
thirty
or
forty
clans
just
as
was
done
among
the
cimmerians
when
the
gundermen
tried
to
push
the
border
northward
years
ago
they
tried
to
colonize
the
southern
marches
of
cimmeria
destroyed
a
few
small
clans
built
a
venarium
you
heard
the
tale
i
have
indeed
replied
balthus
wincing
the
memory
of
that
red
disaster
was
a
black
blot
in
the
chronicles
of
a
proud
and
people
uncle
was
at
venarium
when
the
cimmerians
swarmed
over
the
walls
he
was
one
of
the
few
who
escaped
that
slaughter
i
heard
him
tell
the
tale
many
a
time
the
barbarians
swept
out
of
the
hills
in
a
ravening
horde
without
warning
and
stormed
venarium
with
such
fury
none
could
stand
before
them
men
women
and
children
were
butchered
venarium
was
reduced
to
a
mass
of
charred
ruins
as
it
is
to
this
day
the
aquilonians
were
driven
back
across
the
marches
and
have
never
since
tried
to
colonize
the
cimmerian
country
but
you
speak
of
venarium
familiarly
perhaps
you
were
there
was
grunted
the
other
was
one
of
the
horde
that
swarmed
over
the
hills
i
had
yet
seen
fifteen
snows
but
already
my
name
was
repeated
about
the
council
fires
balthus
involuntarily
recoiled
staring
it
seemed
incredible
that
the
man
walking
tranquilly
at
his
side
should
have
been
one
of
those
screeching
devils
that
had
poured
over
the
walls
of
venarium
on
that
day
to
make
her
streets
run
crimson
you
too
are
a
barbarian
he
exclaimed
involuntarily
the
other
nodded
without
taking
offence
am
conan
a
cimmerian
heard
of
you
fresh
interest
quickened
balthus
gaze
no
wonder
the
pict
had
fallen
victim
to
his
own
sort
of
subtlety
the
cimmerians
were
barbarians
as
ferocious
as
the
picts
and
much
more
intelligent
evidently
conan
had
spent
much
time
among
civilized
men
though
that
contact
had
obviously
not
softened
him
nor
weakened
any
of
his
primitive
instincts
balthus
apprehension
turned
to
admiration
as
he
marked
the
easy
stride
the
effortless
silence
with
which
the
cimmerian
moved
along
the
trail
the
oiled
links
of
his
armor
did
not
clink
and
balthus
knew
conan
could
glide
through
the
deepest
thicket
or
most
tangled
copse
as
noiselessly
as
any
naked
pict
that
ever
lived
not
a
gunderman
it
was
more
assertion
than
question
balthus
shook
his
head
from
the
tauran
seen
good
woodsmen
from
the
tauran
but
the
bossonians
have
sheltered
you
aquilonians
from
the
outer
wildernesses
for
too
many
centuries
you
need
hardening
that
was
true
the
bossonian
marches
with
their
fortified
villages
filled
with
determined
bowmen
had
long
served
aquilonia
as
a
buffer
against
the
outlying
barbarians
now
among
the
settlers
beyond
thunder
river
there
was
growing
up
a
breed
of
capable
of
meeting
the
barbarians
at
their
own
game
but
their
numbers
were
still
scanty
most
of
the
frontiersmen
were
like
balthus
more
of
the
settler
than
the
woodsman
type
the
sun
had
not
set
but
it
was
no
longer
in
sight
hidden
as
it
was
behind
the
dense
forest
wall
the
shadows
were
lengthening
deepening
back
in
the
woods
as
the
companions
strode
on
down
the
trail
will
be
dark
before
we
reach
the
fort
commented
conan
casually
then
he
stopped
short
half
crouching
sword
ready
transformed
into
a
savage
figure
of
suspicion
and
menace
poised
to
spring
and
rend
balthus
had
heard
it
too
a
wild
scream
that
broke
at
its
highest
note
it
was
the
cry
of
a
man
in
dire
fear
or
agony
conan
was
off
in
an
instant
racing
down
the
trail
each
stride
widening
the
distance
between
him
and
his
straining
companion
balthus
puffed
a
curse
among
the
settlements
of
the
tauran
he
was
accounted
a
good
runner
but
conan
was
leaving
him
behind
with
maddening
ease
then
balthus
forgot
his
exasperation
as
his
ears
were
outraged
by
the
most
frightful
cry
he
had
ever
heard
it
was
not
human
this
one
it
was
a
demoniacal
caterwauling
of
hideous
triumph
that
seemed
to
exult
over
fallen
humanity
and
find
echo
in
black
gulfs
beyond
human
ken
balthus
faltered
in
his
stride
and
clammy
sweat
beaded
his
flesh
but
conan
did
not
hesitate
he
darted
around
a
bend
in
the
trail
and
disappeared
and
balthus
panicky
at
finding
himself
alone
with
that
awful
scream
still
shuddering
through
the
forest
in
grisly
echoes
put
on
an
extra
burst
of
speed
and
plunged
after
him
the
aquilonian
slid
to
a
stumbling
halt
almost
colliding
with
the
cimmerian
who
stood
in
the
trail
over
a
crumpled
body
but
conan
was
not
looking
at
the
corpse
which
lay
there
in
the
dust
he
was
glaring
into
the
deep
woods
on
either
side
of
the
trail
balthus
muttered
a
horrified
oath
it
was
the
body
of
a
man
which
lay
there
in
the
trail
a
short
fat
man
clad
in
the
boots
and
despite
the
heat
the
tunic
of
a
wealthy
merchant
his
fat
pale
face
was
set
in
a
stare
of
frozen
horror
his
thick
throat
had
been
slashed
from
ear
to
ear
as
if
by
a
blade
the
short
sword
still
in
its
scabbard
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
had
been
struck
down
without
a
chance
to
fight
for
his
life
pict
balthus
whispered
as
he
turned
to
peer
into
the
deepening
shadows
of
the
forest
conan
shook
his
head
and
straightened
to
scowl
down
at
the
dead
man
forest
devil
this
is
the
fifth
by
crom
do
you
mean
you
ever
hear
of
a
pictish
wizard
called
zogar
sag
balthus
shook
his
head
uneasily
dwells
in
gwawela
the
nearest
village
across
the
river
three
months
ago
he
hid
beside
this
road
and
stole
a
string
of
from
a
bound
for
the
fort
drugged
their
drivers
somehow
the
mules
belonged
to
this
man
conan
casually
indicated
the
corpse
with
his
foot
a
merchant
of
velitrium
they
were
loaded
with
and
old
zogar
stopped
to
guzzle
before
he
got
across
the
river
a
woodsman
named
soractus
trailed
him
and
led
valannus
and
three
soldiers
to
where
he
lay
dead
drunk
in
a
thicket
at
the
importunities
of
tiberias
valannus
threw
zogar
sag
into
a
cell
which
is
the
worst
insult
you
can
give
a
pict
he
managed
to
kill
his
guard
and
escape
and
sent
back
word
that
he
meant
to
kill
tiberias
and
the
five
men
who
captured
him
in
a
way
that
would
make
aquilonians
shudder
for
centuries
to
come
soractus
and
the
soldiers
are
dead
soractus
was
killed
on
the
river
the
soldiers
in
the
very
shadow
of
the
fort
and
now
tiberias
is
dead
no
pict
killed
any
of
them
each
victim
except
tiberias
as
you
see
lacked
his
head
which
no
doubt
is
now
ornamenting
the
altar
of
zogar
sag
particular
god
do
you
know
they
were
killed
by
the
picts
demanded
balthus
conan
pointed
to
the
corpse
of
the
merchant
think
that
was
done
with
a
knife
or
a
sword
look
closer
and
see
that
only
a
talon
could
have
made
a
gash
like
that
the
flesh
is
ripped
not
cut
a
panther
began
balthus
without
conviction
conan
shook
his
head
impatiently
man
from
the
tauran
could
mistake
the
mark
of
a
panther
claws
no
it
a
forest
devil
summoned
by
zogar
sag
to
carry
out
his
revenge
tiberias
was
a
fool
to
start
for
velitrium
alone
and
so
close
to
dusk
but
each
one
of
the
victims
seemed
to
be
smitten
with
madness
just
before
doom
overtook
him
look
here
the
signs
are
plain
enough
tiberias
came
riding
along
the
trail
on
his
mule
maybe
with
a
bundle
of
choice
otter
pelts
behind
his
saddle
to
sell
in
velitrium
and
the
sprang
on
him
from
behind
that
bush
see
where
the
branches
are
crushed
down
gave
one
scream
and
then
his
throat
was
torn
open
and
he
was
selling
his
otter
skins
in
hell
the
mule
ran
away
into
the
woods
listen
even
now
you
can
hear
him
thrashing
about
under
the
trees
the
demon
did
have
time
to
take
tiberias
head
it
took
fright
as
we
came
up
came
up
amended
balthus
must
not
be
a
very
terrible
creature
if
it
flees
from
one
armed
man
but
how
do
you
know
it
was
not
a
pict
with
some
kind
of
a
hook
that
rips
instead
of
slicing
did
you
see
it
was
an
armed
man
grunted
conan
zogar
sag
can
bring
demons
to
aid
him
he
can
tell
them
which
men
to
kill
and
which
to
let
alone
no
i
did
see
it
i
only
saw
the
bushes
shake
as
it
left
the
trail
but
if
you
want
further
proof
look
here
the
slayer
had
stepped
into
the
pool
of
blood
in
which
the
dead
man
sprawled
under
the
bushes
at
the
edge
of
the
path
there
was
a
footprint
made
in
blood
on
the
hard
loam
a
man
make
that
demanded
conan
balthus
felt
his
scalp
prickle
neither
man
nor
any
beast
that
he
had
ever
seen
could
have
left
that
strange
monstrous
print
that
was
curiously
combined
of
the
bird
and
the
reptile
yet
a
true
type
of
neither
he
spread
his
fingers
above
the
print
careful
not
to
touch
it
and
grunted
explosively
he
could
not
span
the
mark
is
it
he
whispered
never
saw
a
beast
that
left
a
spoor
like
that
any
other
sane
man
answered
conan
grimly
a
swamp
demon
they
thick
as
bats
in
the
swamps
beyond
black
river
you
can
hear
them
howling
like
damned
souls
when
the
wind
blows
strong
from
the
south
on
hot
nights
shall
we
do
asked
the
aquilonian
peering
uneasily
into
the
deep
blue
shadows
the
frozen
fear
on
the
dead
countenance
haunted
him
he
wondered
what
hideous
head
the
wretch
had
seen
thrust
grinning
from
among
the
leaves
to
chill
his
blood
with
terror
use
to
try
to
follow
a
demon
grunted
conan
drawing
a
short
woodsman
ax
from
his
girdle
tried
tracking
him
after
he
killed
soractus
i
lost
his
trail
within
a
dozen
steps
he
might
have
grown
himself
wings
and
flown
away
or
sunk
down
through
the
earth
to
hell
i
do
know
i
not
going
after
the
mule
either
it
either
wander
back
to
the
fort
or
to
some
settler
cabin
as
he
spoke
conan
was
busy
at
the
edge
of
the
trail
with
his
ax
with
a
few
strokes
he
cut
a
pair
of
saplings
nine
or
ten
feet
long
and
denuded
them
of
their
branches
then
he
cut
a
length
from
a
vine
that
crawled
among
the
bushes
near
by
and
making
one
end
fast
to
one
of
the
poles
a
couple
of
feet
from
the
end
whipped
the
vine
over
the
other
sapling
and
interlaced
it
back
and
forth
in
a
few
moments
he
had
a
crude
but
strong
litter
demon
is
going
to
get
tiberias
head
if
i
can
help
it
he
growled
carry
the
body
into
the
fort
it
is
more
than
three
miles
i
never
liked
the
fat
fool
but
we
ca
have
pictish
devils
making
so
cursed
free
with
white
men
heads
the
picts
were
a
white
race
though
swarthy
but
the
border
men
never
spoke
of
them
as
such
balthus
took
the
rear
end
of
the
litter
onto
which
conan
unceremoniously
dumped
the
unfortunate
merchant
and
they
moved
on
down
the
trail
as
swiftly
as
possible
conan
made
no
more
noise
laden
with
their
grim
burden
than
he
had
made
when
unencumbered
he
had
made
a
loop
with
the
merchant
belt
at
the
end
of
the
poles
and
was
carrying
his
share
of
the
load
with
one
hand
while
the
other
gripped
his
naked
broadsword
and
his
restless
gaze
roved
the
sinister
walls
about
them
the
shadows
were
thickening
a
darkening
blue
mist
blurred
the
outlines
of
the
foliage
the
forest
deepened
in
the
twilight
became
a
blue
haunt
of
mystery
sheltering
unguessed
things
they
had
covered
more
than
a
mile
and
the
muscles
in
balthus
sturdy
arms
were
beginning
to
ache
a
little
when
a
cry
rang
shuddering
from
the
woods
whose
blue
shadows
were
deepening
into
purple
conan
started
convulsively
and
balthus
almost
let
go
the
poles
woman
cried
the
younger
man
mitra
a
woman
cried
out
then
settler
wife
straying
in
the
woods
snarled
conan
setting
down
his
end
of
the
litter
for
a
cow
probably
and
stay
here
he
dived
like
a
hunting
wolf
into
the
leafy
wall
balthus
hair
bristled
here
alone
with
this
corpse
and
a
devil
hiding
in
the
woods
he
yelped
coming
with
you
and
suiting
action
to
words
he
plunged
after
the
cimmerian
conan
glanced
back
at
him
but
made
no
objection
though
he
did
not
moderate
his
pace
to
accommodate
the
shorter
legs
of
his
companion
balthus
wasted
his
wind
in
swearing
as
the
cimmerian
drew
away
from
him
again
like
a
phantom
between
the
trees
and
then
conan
burst
into
a
dim
glade
and
halted
crouching
lips
snarling
sword
lifted
are
we
stopping
for
panted
balthus
dashing
the
sweat
out
of
his
eyes
and
gripping

short
sword
scream
came
from
this
glade
or
near
by
answered
conan
mistake
the
location
of
sounds
even
in
the
woods
but
where
abruptly
the
sound
rang
out
again
in
the
direction
of
the
trail
they
had
just
quitted
it
rose
piercingly
and
pitifully
the
cry
of
a
woman
in
frantic
terror
and
then
shockingly
it
changed
to
a
yell
of
mocking
laughter
that
might
have
burst
from
the
lips
of
a
fiend
of
lower
hell
in
mitra
name
balthus
face
was
a
pale
blur
in
the
gloom
with
a
scorching
oath
conan
wheeled
and
dashed
back
the
way
he
had
come
and
the
aquilonian
stumbled
bewilderedly
after
him
he
blundered
into
the
cimmerian
as
the
latter
stopped
dead
and
rebounded
from
his
brawny
shoulders
as
though
from
an
iron
statue
gasping
from
the
impact
he
heard
conan
breath
hiss
through
his
teeth
the
cimmerian
seemed
frozen
in
his
tracks
looking
over
his
shoulder
balthus
felt
his
hair
stand
up
stiffly
something
was
moving
through
the
deep
bushes
that
fringed
the
trail
something
that
neither
walked
nor
flew
but
seemed
to
glide
like
a
serpent
but
it
was
not
a
serpent
its
outlines
were
indistinct
but
it
was
taller
than
a
man
and
not
very
bulky
it
gave
off
a
glimmer
of
weird
light
like
a
faint
blue
flame
indeed
the
eery
fire
was
the
only
tangible
thing
about
it
it
might
have
been
an
embodied
flame
moving
with
reason
and
purpose
through
the
blackening
woods
conan
snarled
a
savage
curse
and
hurled
his
ax
with
ferocious
will
but
the
thing
glided
on
without
altering
its
course
indeed
it
was
only
a
few
instants
fleeting
glimpse
they
had
of
it
a
tall
shadowy
thing
of
misty
flame
floating
through
the
thickets
then
it
was
gone
and
the
forest
crouched
in
breathless
stillness
with
a
snarl
conan
plunged
through
the
intervening
foliage
and
into
the
trail
his
profanity
as
balthus
floundered
after
him
was
lurid
and
impassioned
the
cimmerian
was
standing
over
the
litter
on
which
lay
the
body
of
tiberias
and
that
body
no
longer
possessed
a
head
us
with
its
damnable
caterwauling
raved
conan
swinging
his
great
sword
about
his
head
in
his
wrath
might
have
known
i
might
have
guessed
a
trick
now
there
be
five
heads
to
decorate
altar
what
thing
is
it
that
can
cry
like
a
woman
and
laugh
like
a
devil
and
shines
like
as
it
glides
through
the
trees
gasped
balthus
mopping
the
sweat
from
his
pale
face
swamp
devil
responded
conan
morosely
those
poles
we
take
in
the
body
anyway
at
least
our
load
a
bit
lighter
with
which
grim
philosophy
he
gripped
the
leathery
loop
and
stalked
down
the
trail
the
wizard
of
gwawela
fort
tuscelan
stood
on
the
eastern
bank
of
black
river
the
tides
of
which
washed
the
foot
of
the
stockade
the
latter
was
of
logs
as
were
all
the
buildings
within
including
the
donjon
to
dignify
it
by
that
appellation
in
which
were
the
governor
quarters
overlooking
the
stockade
and
the
sullen
river
beyond
that
river
lay
a
huge
forest
which
approached
density
along
the
spongy
shores
men
paced
the
runways
along
the
log
parapet
day
and
night
watching
that
dense
green
wall
seldom
a
menacing
figure
appeared
but
the
sentries
knew
that
they
too
were
watched
fiercely
hungrily
with
the
mercilessness
of
ancient
hate
the
forest
beyond
the
river
might
seem
desolate
and
vacant
of
life
to
the
ignorant
eye
but
life
teemed
there
not
alone
of
bird
and
beast
and
reptile
but
also
of
men
the
fiercest
of
all
the
hunting
beasts
there
at
the
fort
civilization
ended
fort
tuscelan
was
the
last
outpost
of
a
civilized
world
it
represented
the
westernmost
thrust
of
the
dominant
hyborian
races
beyond
the
river
the
primitive
still
reigned
in
shadowy
forests
huts
where
hung
the
grinning
skulls
of
men
and
enclosures
where
fires
flickered
and
drums
rumbled
and
spears
were
whetted
in
the
hands
of
dark
silent
men
with
tangled
black
hair
and
the
eyes
of
serpents
those
eyes
often
glared
through
the
bushes
at
the
fort
across
the
river
once
men
had
built
their
huts
where
that
fort
stood
yes
and
their
huts
had
risen
where
now
stood
the
fields
and
log
cabins
of
settlers
back
beyond
velitrium
that
raw
turbulent
frontier
town
on
the
banks
of
thunder
river
to
the
shores
of
that
other
river
that
bounds
the
bossonian
marches
traders
had
come
and
priests
of
mitra
who
walked
with
bare
feet
and
empty
hands
and
died
horribly
most
of
them
but
soldiers
had
followed
and
men
with
axes
in
their
hands
and
women
and
children
in
wains
back
to
thunder
river
and
still
back
beyond
black
river
the
aborigines
had
been
pushed
with
slaughter
and
massacre
but
the
people
did
not
forget
that
once
conajohara
had
been
theirs
the
guard
inside
the
eastern
gate
bawled
a
challenge
through
a
barred
aperture
torchlight
flickered
glinting
on
a
steel
and
suspicious
eyes
beneath
it
the
gate
snorted
conan
see
it
i
do
you
military
discipline
put
his
teeth
on
edge
the
gate
swung
inward
and
conan
and
his
companion
passed
through
balthus
noted
that
the
gate
was
flanked
by
a
tower
on
each
side
the
summits
of
which
rose
above
the
stockade
he
saw
loopholes
for
arrows
the
guardsmen
grunted
as
they
saw
the
burden
borne
between
the
men
their
pikes
jangled
against
each
other
as
they
thrust
shut
the
gate
chin
on
shoulder
and
conan
asked
testily
you
never
seen
a
headless
body
before
the
face
of
the
soldiers
were
pallid
in
the
torchlight
tiberias
blurted
one
recognize
that
tunic
valerius
here
owes
me
five
lunas
i
told
him
tiberias
had
heard
the
loon
call
when
he
rode
through
the
gate
on
his
mule
with
his
glassy
stare
i
wagered
he
come
back
without
his
head
conan
grunted
enigmatically
motioned
balthus
to
ease
the
litter
to
the
ground
and
then
strode
off
toward
the
governor
quarters
with
the
aquilonian
at
his
heels
the
youth
stared
about
him
eagerly
and
curiously
noting
the
rows
of
barracks
along
the
walls
the
stables
the
tiny
merchants
stalls
the
towering
blockhouse
and
the
other
buildings
with
the
open
square
in
the
middle
where
the
soldiers
drilled
and
where
now
fires
danced
and
men
off
duty
lounged
these
were
now
hurrying
to
join
the
morbid
crowd
gathered
about
the
litter
at
the
gate
the
rangy
figures
of
aquilonian
pikemen
and
forest
runners
mingled
with
the
shorter
stockier
forms
of
bossonian
archers
he
was
not
greatly
surprised
that
the
governor
received
them
himself
autocratic
society
with
its
rigid
caste
laws
lay
east
of
the
marches
valannus
was
still
a
young
man
well
knit
with
a
finely
chiseled
countenance
already
carved
into
sober
cast
by
toil
and
responsibility
left
the
fort
before
daybreak
i
was
told
he
said
to
conan
had
begun
to
fear
that
the
picts
had
caught
you
at
last
they
smoke
my
head
the
whole
river
will
know
it
grunted
conan
hear
pictish
women
wailing
their
dead
as
far
as
velitrium
i
was
on
a
lone
scout
i
could
sleep
i
kept
hearing
drums
talking
across
the
river
talk
each
night
reminded
the
governor
his
fine
eyes
shadowed
as
he
stared
closely
at
conan
he
had
learned
the
unwisdom
of
discounting
wild
men
instincts
was
a
difference
last
night
growled
conan
has
been
ever
since
zogar
sag
got
back
across
the
river
should
either
have
given
him
presents
and
sent
him
home
or
else
hanged
him
sighed
the
governor
advised
that
but
it
hard
for
you
hyborians
to
learn
the
ways
of
the
outlands
said
conan
it
ca
be
helped
now
but
there
be
no
peace
on
the
border
so
long
as
zogar
lives
and
remembers
the
cell
he
sweated
in
i
was
following
a
warrior
who
slipped
over
to
put
a
few
white
notches
on
his
bow
after
i
split
his
head
i
fell
in
with
this
lad
whose
name
is
balthus
and
who
come
from
the
tauran
to
help
hold
the
frontier
valannus
approvingly
eyed
the
young
man
frank
countenance
and
frame
am
glad
to
welcome
you
young
sir
i
wish
more
of
your
people
would
come
we
need
men
used
to
forest
life
many
of
our
soldiers
and
some
of
our
settlers
are
from
the
eastern
provinces
and
know
nothing
of
woodcraft
or
even
of
agricultural
life
many
of
that
breed
this
side
of
velitrium
grunted
conan
town
full
of
them
though
but
listen
valannus
we
found
tiberias
dead
on
the
trail
and
in
a
few
words
he
related
the
grisly
affair
valannus
paled
did
not
know
he
had
left
the
fort
he
must
have
been
mad
was
answered
conan
the
other
four
each
one
when
his
time
came
went
mad
and
rushed
into
the
woods
to
meet
his
death
like
a
hare
running
down
the
throat
of
a
python
called
to
them
from
the
deeps
of
the
forest
something
the
men
call
a
loon
for
lack
of
a
better
name
but
only
the
doomed
ones
could
hear
it
zogar
sag
has
made
a
magic
that
aquilonian
civilization
ca
overcome
to
this
thrust
valannus
made
no
reply
he
wiped
his
brow
with
a
shaky
hand
the
soldiers
know
of
this
left
the
body
by
the
eastern
gate
should
have
concealed
the
fact
hidden
the
corpse
somewhere
in
the
woods
the
soldiers
are
nervous
enough
already
have
found
it
out
some
way
if
i
hidden
the
body
it
would
have
been
returned
to
the
fort
as
the
corpse
of
soractus
was
tied
up
outside
the
gate
for
the
men
to
find
in
the
morning
valannus
shuddered
turning
he
walked
to
a
casement
and
stared
silently
out
over
the
river
black
and
shiny
under
the
glint
of
the
stars
beyond
the
river
the
jungle
rose
like
an
ebony
wall
the
distant
screech
of
a
panther
broke
the
stillness
the
night
pressed
in
blurring
the
sounds
of
the
soldiers
outside
the
blockhouse
dimming
the
fires
a
wind
whispered
through
the
black
branches
rippling
the
dusky
water
on
its
wings
came
a
low
rhythmic
pulsing
sinister
as
the
pad
of
a
foot
all
said
valannus
as
if
speaking
his
thoughts
aloud
do
we
know
what
does
anyone
know
of
the
things
that
jungle
may
hide
we
have
dim
rumors
of
great
swamps
and
rivers
and
a
forest
that
stretches
on
and
on
over
everlasting
plains
and
hills
to
end
at
last
on
the
shores
of
the
western
ocean
but
what
things
lie
between
this
river
and
that
ocean
we
dare
not
even
guess
no
white
man
has
ever
plunged
deep
into
that
fastness
and
returned
alive
to
tell
us
what
he
found
we
are
wise
in
our
civilized
knowledge
but
our
knowledge
extends
just
so
far
to
the
western
bank
of
that
ancient
river
who
knows
what
shapes
earthly
and
unearthly
may
lurk
beyond
the
dim
circle
of
light
our
knowledge
has
cast
knows
what
gods
are
worshipped
under
the
shadows
of
that
heathen
forest
or
what
devils
crawl
out
of
the
black
ooze
of
the
swamps

can
be
sure
that
all
the
inhabitants
of
that
black
country

zogar
sag
a
sage
of
the
eastern
cities
would
sneer
at
his
primitive
as
the
mummery
of
a
fakir
yet
he
has
driven
mad
and
killed
five
men
in
a
manner
no
man
can
explain
i
wonder
if
he
himself
is
wholly
human
i
can
get
within
distance
of
him
i
settle
that
question
growled
conan
helping
himself
to
the
governor
wine
and
pushing
a
glass
toward
balthus
who
took
it
hesitatingly
and
with
an
uncertain
glance
toward
valannus
the
governor
turned
toward
conan
and
stared
at
him
thoughtfully
soldiers
who
do
not
believe
in
ghosts
or
devils
he
said
almost
in
a
panic
of
fear
you
who
believe
in
ghosts
ghouls
goblins
and
all
manner
of
uncanny
things
do
not
seem
to
fear
any
of
the
things
in
which
you
believe
nothing
in
the
universe
cold
steel
wo
cut
answered
conan
threw
my
ax
at
the
demon
and
he
took
no
hurt
but
i
might
have
missed
in
the
dusk
or
a
branch
deflected
its
flight
i
not
going
out
of
my
way
looking
for
devils
but
i
would
step
out
of
my
path
to
let

go
by

lifted
his
head
and
met

gaze
squarely
more
depends
on
you
than
you
realize
you
know
the
weakness
of
this
province
a
slender
wedge
thrust
into
the
untamed
wilderness
you
know
that
the
lives
of
all
the
people
west
of
the
marches
depend
on
this
fort
were
it
to
fall
red
axes
would
be
splintering
the
gates
of
velitrium
before
a
horseman
could
cross
the
marches
his
majesty
or
his
majesty
advisers
have
ignored
my
plea
that
more
troops
be
sent
to
hold
the
frontier
they
know
nothing
of
border
conditions
and
are
averse
to
expending
any
more
money
in
this
direction
the
fate
of
the
frontier
depends
upon
the
men
who
now
hold
it
know
that
most
of
the
army
which
conquered
conajohara
has
been
withdrawn
you
know
the
force
left
me
is
inadequate
especially
since
that
devil
zogar
sag
managed
to
poison
our
water
supply
and
forty
men
died
in
one
day
many
of
the
others
are
sick
or
have
been
bitten
by
serpents
or
mauled
by
wild
beasts
which
seem
to
swarm
in
increasing
numbers
in
the
vicinity
of
the
fort
the
soldiers

zogar
boast
that
he
could
summon
the
forest
beasts
to
slay
his
enemies
have
three
hundred
pikemen
four
hundred
bossonian
archers
and
perhaps
fifty
men
who
like
yourself
are
skilled
in
woodcraft
they
are
worth
ten
times
their
number
of
soldiers
but
there
are
so
few
of
them
frankly
conan
my
situation
is
becoming
precarious
the
soldiers
whisper
of
desertion
they
are
believing
zogar
sag
has
loosed
devils
on
us
they
fear
the
black
plague
with
which
he
threatened
us
the
terrible
black
death
of
the
swamplands
when
i
see
a
sick
soldier
i
sweat
with
fear
of
seeing
him
turn
black
and
shrivel
and
die
before
my
eyes
if
the
plague
is
loosed
upon
us
the
soldiers
will
desert
in
a
body
the
border
will
be
left
unguarded
and
nothing
will
check
the
sweep
of
the
hordes
to
the
very
gates
of
velitrium
maybe
beyond
if
we
can
not
hold
the
fort
how
can
they
hold
the
town
zogar
sag
must
die
if
we
are
to
hold
conajohara
you
have
penetrated
the
unknown
deeper
than
any
other
man
in
the
fort
you
know
where
gwawela
stands
and
something
of
the
forest
trails
across
the
river
will
you
take
a
band
of
men
tonight
and
endeavour
to
kill
or
capture
him
oh
i
know
it
mad
there
is
more
than
one
chance
in
a
thousand
that
any
of
you
will
come
back
alive
but
if
we
do
get
him
it
death
for
us
all
you
can
take
as
many
men
as
you
wish
dozen
men
are
better
for
a
job
like
that
than
a
regiment
answered
conan
hundred
men
could
fight
their
way
to
gwawela
and
back
but
a
dozen
might
slip
in
and
out
again
let
me
pick
my
men
i
want
any
soldiers
me
go
eagerly
exclaimed
balthus
hunted

all
my
life
on
the
tauran
right
valannus
we
eat
at
the
stall
where
the
foresters
gather
and
i
pick
my
men
we
start
within
an
hour
drop
down
the
river
in
a
boat
to
a
point
below
the
village
and
then
steal
upon
it
through
the
woods
if
we
live
we
should
be
back
by
daybreak
the
crawlers
in
the
dark
the
river
was
a
vague
trace
between
walls
of
ebony
the
paddles
that
propelled
the
long
boat
creeping
along
in
the
dense
shadow
of
the
eastern
bank
dipped
softly
into
the
water
making
no
more
noise
than
the
beak
of
a
heron
the
broad
shoulders
of
the
man
in
front
of
balthus
were
a
blur
in
the
dense
gloom
he
knew
that
not
even
the
keen
eyes
of
the
man
who
knelt
in
the
prow
would
discern
anything
more
than
a
few
feet
ahead
of
them
conan
was
feeling
his
way
by
instinct
and
an
intensive
familiarity
with
the
river
no
one
spoke
balthus
had
had
a
good
look
at
his
companions
in
the
fort
before
they
slipped
out
of
the
stockade
and
down
the
bank
into
the
waiting
canoe
they
were
of
a
new
breed
growing
up
in
the
world
on
the
raw
edge
of
the
frontier
men
whom
grim
necessity
had
taught
woodcraft
aquilonians
of
the
western
provinces
to
a
man
they
had
many
points
in
common
they
dressed
alike
in
buckskin
boots
leathern
breeks
and
deerskin
shirts
with
broad
girdles
that
held
axes
and
short
swords
and
they
were
all
gaunt
and
scarred
and
sinewy
and
taciturn
they
were
wild
men
of
a
sort
yet
there
was
still
a
wide
gulf
between
them
and
the
cimmerian
they
were
sons
of
civilization
reverted
to
a
he
was
a
barbarian
of
a
thousand
generations
of
barbarians
they
had
acquired
stealth
and
craft
but
he
had
been
born
to
these
things
he
excelled
them
even
in
lithe
economy
of
motion
they
were
wolves
but
he
was
a
tiger
balthus
admired
them
and
their
leader
and
felt
a
pulse
of
pride
that
he
was
admitted
into
their
company
he
was
proud
that
his
paddle
made
no
more
noise
than
did
theirs
in
that
respect
at
least
he
was
their
equal
though
woodcraft
learned
in
hunts
on
the
tauran
could
never
equal
that
ground
into
the
souls
of
men
on
the
savage
border
below
the
fort
the
river
made
a
wide
bend
the
lights
of
the
outpost
were
quickly
lost
but
the
canoe
held
on
its
way
for
nearly
a
mile
avoiding
snags
and
floating
logs
with
almost
uncanny
precision
then
a
low
grunt
from
their
leader
and
they
swung
its
head
about
and
glided
toward
the
opposite
shore
emerging
from
the
black
shadows
of
the
brush
that
fringed
the
bank
and
coming
into
the
open
of
the
midstream
created
a
peculiar
illusion
of
rash
exposure
but
the
stars
gave
little
light
and
balthus
knew
that
unless
one
were
watching
for
it
it
would
be
all
but
impossible
for
the
keenest
eye
to
make
out
the
shadowy
shape
of
the
canoe
crossing
the
river
they
swung
in
under
the
overhanging
bushes
of
the
western
shore
and
balthus
groped
for
and
found
a
projecting
root
which
he
grasped
no
word
was
spoken
all
instructions
had
been
given
before
the
left
the
fort
as
silently
as
a
great
panther
conan
slid
over
the
side
and
vanished
in
the
bushes
equally
noiseless
nine
men
followed
him
to
balthus
grasping
the
root
with
his
paddle
across
his
knee
it
seemed
incredible
that
ten
men
should
thus
fade
into
the
tangled
forest
without
a
sound
he
settled
himself
to
wait
no
word
passed
between
him
and
the
other
man
who
had
been
left
with
him
somewhere
a
mile
or
so
to
the
northwest
zogar
sag
village
stood
girdled
with
thick
woods
balthus
understood
his
orders
he
and
his
companion
were
to
wait
for
the
return
of
the
if
conan
and
his
men
had
not
returned
by
the
first
tinge
of
dawn
they
were
to
race
back
up
the
river
to
the
fort
and
report
that
the
forest
had
again
taken
its
immemorial
toll
of
the
invading
race
the
silence
was
oppressive
no
sound
came
from
the
black
woods
invisible
beyond
the
ebony
masses
that
were
the
overhanging
bushes
balthus
no
longer
heard
the
drums
they
had
been
silent
for
hours
he
kept
blinking
unconsciously
trying
to
see
through
the
deep
gloom
the
dank
of
the
river
and
the
damp
forest
oppressed
him
somewhere
near
by
there
was
a
sound
as
if
a
big
fish
had
flopped
and
splashed
the
water
balthus
thought
it
must
have
leaped
so
close
to
the
canoe
that
it
had
struck
the
side
for
a
slight
quiver
vibrated
the
craft
the
stern
began
to
swing
slightly
away
from
the
shore
the
man
behind
him
must
have
let
go
of
the
projection
he
was
gripping
balthus
twisted
his
head
to
hiss
a
warning
and
could
just
make
out
the
figure
of
his
companion
a
slightly
blacker
bulk
in
the
blackness
the
man
did
not
reply
wondering
if
he
had
fallen
asleep
balthus
reached
out
and
grasped
his
shoulder
to
his
amazement
the
man
crumpled
under
his
touch
and
slumped
down
in
the
canoe
twisting
his
body
half
about
balthus
groped
for
him
his
heart
shooting
into
his
throat
his
fumbling
fingers
slid
over
the
man
throat
only
the
youth
convulsive
clenching
of
his
jaws
choked
back
the
cry
that
rose
to
his
lips
his
fingers
encountered
a
gaping
oozing
wound
his
companion
throat
had
been
cut
from
ear
to
ear
in
that
instant
of
horror
and
panic
balthus
started
up
and
then
a
muscular
arm
out
of
the
darkness
locked
fiercely
about
his
throat
strangling
his
yell
the
canoe
rocked
wildly
balthus
knife
was
in
his
hand
though
he
did
not
remember
jerking
it
out
of
his
boot
and
he
stabbed
fiercely
and
blindly
he
felt
the
blade
sink
deep
and
a
fiendish
yell
rang
in
his
ear
a
yell
that
was
horribly
answered
the
darkness
seemed
to
come
to
life
about
him
a
bestial
clamor
rose
on
all
sides
and
other
arms
grappled
him
borne
under
a
mass
of
hurtling
bodies
the
canoe
rolled
sidewise
but
before
he
went
under
with
it
something
cracked
against
balthus
head
and
the
night
was
briefly
illuminated
by
a
blinding
burst
of
fire
before
it
gave
way
to
a
blackness
where
not
even
stars
shone
the
beasts
of
zogar
sag
fires
dazzled
balthus
again
as
he
slowly
recovered
his
senses
he
blinked
shook
his
head
their
glare
hurt
his
eyes
a
confused
medley
of
sound
rose
about
him
growing
more
distinct
as
his
senses
cleared
he
lifted
his
head
and
stared
stupidly
about
him
black
figures
hemmed
him
in
etched
against
crimson
tongues
of
flame
memory
and
understanding
came
in
a
rush
he
was
bound
upright
to
a
post
in
an
open
space
ringed
by
fierce
and
terrible
figures
beyond
that
ring
fires
burned
tended
by
naked
women
beyond
the
fires
he
saw
huts
of
mud
and
wattle
thatched
with
brush
beyond
the
huts
there
was
a
stockade
with
a
broad
gate
but
he
saw
these
things
only
incidentally
even
the
cryptic
dark
women
with
their
curious
coiffures
were
noted
by
him
only
absently
his
full
attention
was
fixed
in
awful
fascination
on
the
men
who
stood
glaring
at
him
short
men
they
were
naked
except
for
scanty
the
firelight
brought
out
the
play
of
their
swelling
muscles
in
bold
relief
their
dark
faces
were
immobile
but
their
narrow
eyes
glittered
with
the
fire
that
burns
in
the
eyes
of
a
stalking
tiger
their
tangled
manes
were
bound
back
with
bands
of
copper
swords
and
axes
were
in
their
hands
crude
bandages
banded
the
limbs
of
some
and
smears
of
blood
were
dried
on
their
dark
skins
there
had
been
fighting
recent
and
deadly
his
eyes
wavered
away
from
the
steady
glare
of
his
captors
and
he
repressed
a
cry
of
horror
a
few
feet
away
there
rose
a
low
hideous
pyramid
it
was
built
of
gory
human
heads
dead
eyes
glared
glassily
up
at
the
black
sky
numbly
he
recognized
the
countenances
which
were
turned
toward
him
they
were
the
heads
of
the
men
who
had
followed
conan
into
the
forest
he
could
not
tell
if
the
cimmerian
head
were
among
them
only
a
few
faces
were
visible
to
him
it
looked
to
him
as
if
there
must
be
ten
or
eleven
heads
at
least
a
deadly
sickness
assailed
him
he
fought
a
desire
to
retch
beyond
the
heads
lay
the
bodies
of
half
a
dozen
picts
and
he
was
aware
of
a
fierce
exultation
at
the
sight
the
forest
runners
had
taken
toll
at
least
twisting
his
head
away
from
the
ghastly
spectacle
he
became
aware
that
another
post
stood
near
him
a
stake
painted
black
as
was
the
one
to
which
he
was
bound
a
man
sagged
in
his
bonds
there
naked
except
for
his
leathern
breeks
whom
balthus
recognized
as
one
of
conan
woodsmen
blood
trickled
from
his
mouth
oozed
sluggishly
from
a
gash
in
his
side
lifting
his
head
as
he
licked
his
livid
lips
he
muttered
making
himself
heard
with
difficulty
above
the
fiendish
clamor
of
the
picts
they
got
you
too
up
in
the
water
and
cut
the
other
fellow
throat
groaned
balthus
never
heard
them
till
they
were
on
us
mitra
how
can
anything
move
so
silently
devils
mumbled
the
frontiersman
must
have
been
watching
us
from
the
time
we
left
midstream
we
walked
into
a
trap
arrows
from
all
sides
were
ripping
into
us
before
we
knew
it
most
of
us
dropped
at
the
first
fire
three
or
four
broke
through
the
bushes
and
came
to
but
there
were
too
many
conan
might
have
gotten
away
i
have
seen
his
head
been
better
for
you
and
me
if
killed
us
outright
i
ca
blame
conan
ordinarily
we
have
gotten
to
the
village
without
being
discovered
they
do
keep
spies
on
the
river
bank
as
far
down
as
we
landed
we
must
have
stumbled
into
a
big
party
coming
up
the
river
from
the
south
some
devilment
is
up
too
many
picts
here
these
are
all
gwaweli
men
from
the
western
tribes
here
and
from
up
and
down
the
river
balthus
stared
at
the
ferocious
shapes
little
as
he
knew
of
pictish
ways
he
was
aware
that
the
number
of
men
clustered
about
them
was
out
of
proportion
to
the
size
of
the
village
there
were
not
enough
huts
to
have
accommodated
them
all
then
he
noticed
that
there
was
a
difference
in
the
barbaric
tribal
designs
painted
on
their
faces
and
breasts
kind
of
devilment
muttered
the
forest
runner
might
have
gathered
here
to
watch
zogar
he
make
some
rare
magic
with
our
carcasses
well
a
does
expect
to
die
in
bed
but
i
wish
we
gone
out
along
with
the
rest
the
wolfish
howling
of
the
picts
rose
in
volume
and
exultation
and
from
a
movement
in
their
ranks
an
eager
surging
and
crowding
balthus
deduced
that
someone
of
importance
was
coming
twisting
his
head
about
he
saw
that
the
stakes
were
set
before
a
long
building
larger
than
the
other
huts
decorated
by
human
skulls
dangling
from
the
eaves
through
the
door
of
that
structure
now
danced
a
fantastic
figure
muttered
the
woodsman
his
bloody
countenance
set
in
wolfish
lines
as
he
unconsciously
strained
at
his
cords
balthus
saw
a
lean
figure
of
middle
height
almost
hidden
in
ostrich
plumes
set
on
a
harness
of
leather
and
copper
from
amidst
the
plumes
peered
a
hideous
and
malevolent
face
the
plumes
puzzled
balthus
he
knew
their
source
lay
half
the
width
of
a
world
to
the
south
they
fluttered
and
rustled
evilly
as
the
shaman
leaped
and
cavorted
with
fantastic
bounds
and
prancings
he
entered
the
ring
and
whirled
before
his
bound
and
silent
captives
with
another
man
it
would
have
seemed
ridiculous
a
foolish
savage
prancing
meaninglessly
in
a
whirl
of
feathers
but
that
ferocious
face
glaring
out
from
the
billowing
mass
gave
the
scene
a
grim
significance
no
man
with
a
face
like
that
could
seem
ridiculous
or
like
anything
except
the
devil
he
was
suddenly
he
froze
to
statuesque
stillness
the
plumes
rippled
once
and
sank
about
him
the
howling
warriors
fell
silent
zogar
sag
stood
erect
and
motionless
and
he
seemed
to
increase
in
height
to
grow
and
expand
balthus
experienced
the
illusion
that
the
pict
was
towering
above
him
staring
contemptuously
down
from
a
great
height
though
he
knew
the
shaman
was
not
as
tall
as
himself
he
shook
off
the
illusion
with
difficulty
the
shaman
was
talking
now
a
harsh
guttural
intonation
that
yet
carried
the
hiss
of
a
cobra
he
thrust
his
head
on
his
long
neck
toward
the
wounded
man
on
the
stake
his
eyes
shone
red
as
blood
in
the
firelight
the
frontiersman
spat
full
in
his
face
with
a
fiendish
howl
zogar
bounded
convulsively
into
the
air
and
the
warriors
gave
tongue
to
a
yell
that
shuddered
up
to
the
stars
they
rushed
toward
the
man
on
the
stake
but
the
shaman
beat
them
back
a
snarled
command
sent
men
running
to
the
gate
they
hurled
it
open
turned
and
raced
back
to
the
circle
the
ring
of
men
split
divided
with
desperate
haste
to
right
and
left
balthus
saw
the
women
and
naked
children
scurrying
to
the
huts
they
peeked
out
of
doors
and
windows
a
broad
lane
was
left
to
the
open
gate
beyond
which
loomed
the
black
forest
crowding
sullenly
in
upon
the
clearing
unlighted
by
the
fires
a
tense
silence
reigned
as
zogar
sag
turned
toward
the
forest
raised
on
his
tiptoes
and
sent
a
weird
inhuman
call
shuddering
out
into
the
night
somewhere
far
out
in
the
black
forest
a
deeper
cry
answered
him
balthus
shuddered
from
the
timbre
of
that
cry
he
knew
it
never
came
from
a
human
throat
he
remembered
what
valannus
had
said
that
zogar
boasted
that
he
could
summon
wild
beasts
to
do
his
bidding
the
woodsman
was
livid
beneath
his
mask
of
blood
he
licked
his
lips
spasmodically
the
village
held
its
breath
zogar
sag
stood
still
as
a
statue
his
plumes
trembling
faintly
about
him
but
suddenly
the
gate
was
no
longer
empty
a
shuddering
gasp
swept
over
the
village
and
men
crowded
hastily
back
jamming
one
another
between
the
huts
balthus
felt
the
short
hair
stir
on
his
scalp
the
creature
that
stood
in
the
gate
was
like
the
embodiment
of
nightmare
legend
its
color
was
of
a
curious
pale
quality
which
made
it
seem
ghostly
and
unreal
in
the
dim
light
but
there
was
nothing
unreal
about
the
savage
head
and
the
great
curved
fangs
that
glistened
in
the
firelight
on
noiseless
padded
feet
it
approached
like
a
phantom
out
of
the
past
it
was
a
survival
of
an
older
grimmer
age
the
ogre
of
many
an
ancient
legend
a
tiger
no
hyborian
hunter
had
looked
upon
one
of
those
primordial
brutes
for
centuries
immemorial
myths
lent
the
creatures
a
supernatural
quality
induced
by
their
ghostly
color
and
their
fiendish
ferocity
the
beast
that
glided
toward
the
men
on
the
stakes
was
longer
and
heavier
than
a
common
striped
tiger
almost
as
bulky
as
a
bear
its
shoulders
and
forelegs
were
so
massive
and
mightily
muscled
as
to
give
it
a
curiously
look
though
its
were
more
powerful
than
that
of
a
lion
its
jaws
were
massive
but
its
head
was
brutishly
shaped
its
brain
capacity
was
small
it
had
room
for
no
instincts
except
those
of
destruction
it
was
a
freak
of
carnivorous
development
evolution
run
amuck
in
a
horror
of
fangs
and
talons
this
was
the
monstrosity
zogar
sag
had
summoned
out
of
the
forest
balthus
no
longer
doubted
the
actuality
of
the
shaman
magic
only
the
black
arts
could
establish
a
domination
over
that
monster
like
a
whisper
at
the
back
of
his
consciousness
rose
the
vague
memory
of
the
name
of
an
ancient
god
of
darkness
and
primordial
fear
to
whom
once
both
men
and
beasts
bowed
and
whose
children
men
whispered
still
lurked
in
dark
corners
of
the
world
new
horror
tinged
the
glare
he
fixed
on
zogar
sag
the
monster
moved
past
the
heap
of
bodies
and
the
pile
of
gory
heads
without
appearing
to
notice
them
he
was
no
scavenger
he
hunted
only
the
living
in
a
life
dedicated
solely
to
slaughter
an
awful
hunger
burned
greenly
in
the
wide
unwinking
eyes
the
hunger
not
alone
of
but
the
lust
of
his
gaping
jaws
slavered
the
shaman
stepped
back
his
hand
waved
toward
the
woodsman
the
great
cat
sank
into
a
crouch
and
balthus
numbly
remembered
tales
of
its
appalling
ferocity
of
how
it
would
spring
upon
an
elephant
and
drive
its
fangs
so
deeply
into
the
titan
skull
that
they
could
never
be
withdrawn
but
would
keep
it
nailed
to
its
victim
to
die
by
starvation
the
shaman
cried
out
shrilly
and
with
an
roar
the
monster
sprang
balthus
had
never
dreamed
of
such
a
spring
such
a
hurtling
of
incarnated
destruction
embodied
in
that
giant
bulk
of
iron
thews
and
ripping
talons
full
on
the
woodsman
breast
it
struck
and
the
stake
splintered
and
snapped
at
the
base
crashing
to
the
earth
under
the
impact
then
the
was
gliding
toward
the
gate
half
dragging
half
carrying
a
hideous
crimson
hulk
that
only
faintly
resembled
a
man
balthus
glared
almost
paralysed
his
brain
refusing
to
credit
what
his
eyes
had
seen
in
that
leap
the
great
beast
had
not
only
broken
off
the
stake
it
had
ripped
the
mangled
body
of
its
victim
from
the
post
to
which
it
was
bound
the
huge
talons
in
that
instant
of
contact
had
disemboweled
and
partially
dismembered
the
man
and
the
giant
fangs
had
torn
away
the
whole
top
of
his
head
shearing
through
the
skull
as
easily
as
through
flesh
stout
rawhide
thongs
had
given
way
like
paper
where
the
thongs
had
held
flesh
and
bones
had
not
balthus
retched
suddenly
he
had
hunted
bears
and
panthers
but
he
had
never
dreamed
the
beast
lived
which
could
make
such
a
red
ruin
of
a
human
frame
in
the
flicker
of
an
instant
the
vanished
through
the
gate
and
a
few
moments
later
a
deep
roar
sounded
through
the
forest
receding
in
the
distance
but
the
picts
still
shrank
back
against
the
huts
and
the
shaman
still
stood
facing
the
gate
that
was
like
a
black
opening
to
let
in
the
night
cold
sweat
burst
suddenly
out
on
balthus
skin
what
new
horror
would
come
through
that
gate
to
make
of
his
body
sick
panic
assailed
him
and
he
strained
futilely
at
his
thongs
the
night
pressed
in
very
black
and
horrible
outside
the
firelight
the
fires
themselves
glowed
lurid
as
the
fires
of
hell
he
felt
the
eyes
of
the
picts
upon
him
hundreds
of
hungry
cruel
eyes
that
reflected
the
lust
of
souls
utterly
without
humanity
as
he
knew
it
they
no
longer
seemed
men
they
were
devils
of
this
black
jungle
as
inhuman
as
the
creatures
to
which
the
fiend
in
the
nodding
plumes
screamed
through
the
darkness
zogar
sent
another
call
shuddering
through
the
night
and
it
was
utterly
unlike
the
first
cry
there
was
a
hideous
sibilance
in
it
balthus
turned
cold
at
the
implication
if
a
serpent
could
hiss
that
loud
it
would
make
just
such
a
sound
this
time
there
was
no
answer
only
a
period
of
breathless
silence
in
which
the
pound
of
balthus
heart
strangled
him
and
then
there
sounded
a
swishing
outside
the
gate
a
dry
rustling
that
sent
chills
down
balthus
spine
again
the
firelit
gate
held
a
hideous
occupant
again
balthus
recognized
the
monster
from
ancient
legends
he
saw
and
knew
the
ancient
and
evil
serpent
which
swayed
there
its
head
huge
as
that
of
a
horse
as
high
as
a
tall
man
head
and
its
palely
gleaming
barrel
rippling
out
behind
it
a
forked
tongue
darted
in
and
out
and
the
firelight
glittered
on
bared
fangs
balthus
became
incapable
of
emotion
the
horror
of
his
fate
paralysed
him
that
was
the
reptile
that
the
ancients
called
ghost
snake
the
pale
abominable
terror
that
of
old
glided
into
huts
by
night
to
devour
whole
families
like
the
python
it
crushed
its
victim
but
unlike
other
constrictors
its
fangs
bore
venom
that
carried
madness
and
death
it
too
had
long
been
considered
extinct
but
valannus
had
spoken
truly
no
white
man
knew
what
shapes
haunted
the
great
forests
beyond
black
river
it
came
on
silently
rippling
over
the
ground
its
hideous
head
on
the
same
level
its
neck
curving
back
slightly
for
the
stroke
balthus
gazed
with
glazed
hypnotized
stare
into
that
loathesome
gullet
down
which
he
would
soon
be
engulfed
and
he
was
aware
of
no
sensation
except
a
vague
nausea
and
then
something
that
glinted
in
the
firelight
streaked
from
the
shadows
of
the
huts
and
the
great
reptile
whipped
about
and
went
into
instant
convulsions
as
in
a
dream
balthus
saw
a
short
transfixing
the
mighty
neck
just
below
the
gaping
jaws
the
shaft
protruded
from
one
side
the
steel
head
from
the
other
knotting
and
looping
hideously
the
maddened
reptile
rolled
into
the
circle
of
men
who
strove
back
from
him
the
spear
had
not
severed
its
spine
but
merely
transfixed
its
great
neck
muscles
its
furiously
lashing
tail
mowed
down
a
dozen
men
and
its
jaws
snapped
convulsively
splashing
others
with
venom
that
burned
like
liquid
fire
howling
cursing
screaming
frantic
they
scattered
before
it
knocking
each
other
down
in
their
flight
trampling
the
fallen
bursting
through
the
huts
the
giant
snake
rolled
into
a
fire
scattering
sparks
and
brands
and
the
pain
lashed
it
to
more
frenzied
efforts
a
hut
wall
buckled
under
the
impact
of
its
flailing
tail
disgorging
howling
people
men
stampeded
through
the
fires
knocking
the
logs
right
and
left
the
flames
sprang
up
then
sank
a
reddish
dim
glow
was
all
that
lighted
that
nightmare
scene
where
the
giant
reptile
whipped
and
rolled
and
men
clawed
and
shrieked
in
frantic
flight
balthus
felt
something
jerk
at
his
wrists
and
then
miraculously
he
was
free
and
a
strong
hand
dragged
him
behind
the
post
dazedly
he
saw
conan
felt
the
forest
man
iron
grip
on
his
arm
there
was
blood
on
the
cimmerian
mail
dried
blood
on
the
sword
in
his
right
hand
he
loomed
dim
and
gigantic
in
the
shadowy
light
on
before
they
get
over
their
panic
balthus
felt
the
haft
of
an
ax
shoved
into
his
hand
zogar
sag
had
disappeared
conan
dragged
balthus
after
him
until
the
youth
numb
brain
awoke
and
his
legs
began
to
move
of
their
own
accord
then
conan
released
him
and
ran
into
the
building
where
the
skulls
hung
balthus
followed
him
he
got
a
glimpse
of
a
grim
stone
altar
faintly
lighted
by
the
glow
outside
five
human
heads
grinned
on
that
altar
and
there
was
a
grisly
familiarity
about
the
features
of
the
freshest
it
was
the
head
of
the
merchant
tiberias
behind
the
altar
was
an
idol
dim
indistinct
bestial
yet
vaguely
in
outline
then
fresh
horror
choked
balthus
as
the
shape
heaved
up
suddenly
with
a
rattle
of
chains
lifting
long
misshapen
arms
in
the
gloom
conan
sword
flailed
down
crunching
through
flesh
and
bone
and
then
the
cimmerian
was
dragging
balthus
around
the
altar
past
a
huddled
shaggy
bulk
on
the
floor
to
a
door
at
the
back
of
the
long
hut
through
this
they
burst
out
into
the
enclosure
again
but
a
few
yards
beyond
them
loomed
the
stockade
it
was
dark
behind
the
the
mad
stampede
of
the
picts
had
not
carried
them
in
that
direction
at
the
wall
conan
halted
gripped
balthus
and
heaved
him
at
arm
length
into
the
air
as
he
might
have
lifted
a
child
balthus
grasped
the
points
of
the
upright
logs
set
in
the
mud
and
scrambled
up
on
them
ignoring
the
havoc
done
his
skin
he
lowered
a
hand
to
the
cimmerian
when
around
a
corner
of
the
sprang
a
fleeing
pict
he
halted
short
glimpsing
the
man
on
the
wall
in
the
faint
glow
of
the
fires
conan
hurled
his
ax
with
deadly
aim
but
the
warrior
mouth
was
already
open
for
a
yell
of
warning
and
it
rang
loud
above
the
din
cut
short
as
he
dropped
with
a
shattered
skull
blinding
terror
had
not
submerged
all
ingrained
instincts
as
that
wild
yell
rose
above
the
clamor
there
was
an
instant
lull
and
then
a
hundred
throats
bayed
ferocious
answer
and
warriors
came
leaping
to
repel
the
attack
presaged
by
the
warning
conan
leaped
high
caught
not
balthus
hand
but
his
arm
near
the
shoulder
and
swung
himself
up
balthus
set
his
teeth
against
the
strain
and
then
the
cimmerian
was
on
the
wall
beside
him
and
the
fugitives
dropped
down
on
the
other
side
the
children
of
jhebbal
sag
way
is
the
river
balthus
was
confused
do
dare
try
for
the
river
now
grunted
conan
woods
between
the
village
and
the
river
are
swarming
with
warriors
come
on
head
in
the
last
direction
they
expect
us
to
go
west
looking
back
as
they
entered
the
thick
growth
balthus
beheld
the
wall
dotted
with
black
heads
as
the
savages
peered
over
the
picts
were
bewildered
they
had
not
gained
the
wall
in
time
to
see
the
fugitives
take
cover
they
had
rushed
to
the
wall
expecting
to
repel
an
attack
in
force
they
had
seen
the
body
of
the
dead
warrior
but
no
enemy
was
in
sight
balthus
realized
that
they
did
not
yet
know
their
prisoner
had
escaped
from
other
sounds
he
believed
that
the
warriors
directed
by
the
shrill
voice
of
zogar
sag
were
destroying
the
wounded
serpent
with
arrows
the
monster
was
out
of
the
shaman
control
a
moment
later
the
quality
of
the
yells
was
altered
screeches
of
rage
rose
in
the
night
conan
laughed
grimly
he
was
leading
balthus
along
a
narrow
trail
that
ran
west
under
the
black
branches
stepping
as
swiftly
and
surely
as
if
he
trod
a
thoroughfare
balthus
stumbled
after
him
guiding
himself
by
feeling
the
dense
wall
on
either
hand
be
after
us
now
zogar
discovered
you
gone
and
he
knows
my
head
was
in
the
pile
before
the
the
dog
if
i
had
another
spear
i
have
thrown
it
through
him
before
i
struck
the
snake
keep
to
the
trail
they
ca
track
us
by
torchlight
and
there
are
a
score
of
paths
leading
from
the
village
they
follow
those
leading
to
the
river
first
throw
a
cordon
of
warriors
for
miles
along
the
bank
expecting
us
to
try
to
break
through
we
wo
take
to
the
woods
until
we
have
to
we
can
make
better
time
on
this
trail
now
buckle
down
to
it
and
run
as
you
never
ran
before
got
over
their
panic
cursed
quick
panted
balthus
complying
with
a
fresh
burst
of
speed
not
afraid
of
anything
very
long
grunted
conan
for
a
space
nothing
was
said
between
them
the
fugitives
devoted
all
their
attention
to
covering
distance
they
were
plunging
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
wilderness
and
getting
farther
away
from
civilization
at
every
step
but
balthus
did
not
question
conan
wisdom
the
cimmerian
presently
took
time
to
grunt
we
far
enough
away
from
the
village
we
swing
back
to
the
river
in
a
big
circle
no
other
village
within
miles
of
gwawela
all
the
picts
are
gathered
in
that
vicinity
we
circle
wide
around
them
they
ca
track
us
until
daylight
they
pick
up
our
path
then
but
before
dawn
we
leave
the
trail
and
take
to
the
woods
they
plunged
on
the
yells
died
out
behind
them
balthus
breath
was
whistling
through
his
teeth
he
felt
a
pain
in
his
side
and
running
became
torture
he
blundered
against
the
bushes
on
each
side
of
the
trail
conan
pulled
up
suddenly
turned
and
stared
back
down
the
dim
path
somewhere
the
moon
was
rising
a
dim
white
glow
amidst
a
tangle
of
branches
we
take
to
the
woods
panted
balthus
me
your
ax
murmured
conan
softly
is
close
behind
us
we
better
leave
the
trail
exclaimed
balthus
conan
shook
his
head
and
drew
his
companion
into
a
dense
thicket
the
moon
rose
higher
making
a
dim
light
in
the
path
ca
fight
the
whole
tribe
whispered
balthus
human
being
could
have
found
our
trail
so
quickly
or
followed
us
so
swiftly
muttered
conan
silent
there
followed
a
tense
silence
in
which
balthus
felt
that
his
heart
could
be
heard
pounding
for
miles
away
then
abruptly
without
a
sound
to
announce
its
coming
a
savage
head
appeared
in
the
dim
path
heart
jumped
into
his
throat
at
first
glance
he
feared
to
look
upon
the
awful
head
of
the
but
this
head
was
smaller
more
narrow
it
was
a
leopard
which
stood
there
snarling
silently
and
glaring
down
the
trail
what
wind
there
was
was
blowing
toward
the
hiding
men
concealing
their
scent
the
beast
lowered
his
head
and
snuffed
the
trail
then
moved
forward
uncertainly
a
chill
played
down
spine
the
brute
was
undoubtedly
trailing
them
and
it
was
suspicious
it
lifted
its
head
its
eyes
glowing
like
balls
of
fire
and
growled
low
in
its
throat
and
at
that
instant
conan
hurled
the
ax
all
the
weight
of
arm
and
shoulder
was
behind
the
throw
and
the
ax
was
a
streak
of
silver
in
the
dim
moon
almost
before
he
realized
what
had
happened
balthus
saw
the
leopard
rolling
on
the
ground
in
its
the
handle
of
the
ax
standing
up
from
its
head
the
head
of
the
weapon
had
split
its
narrow
skull
conan
bounded
from
the
bushes
wrenched
his
ax
free
and
dragged
the
limp
body
in
among
the
trees
concealing
it
from
the
casual
glance
let
go
and
go
fast
he
grunted
leading
the
way
southward
away
from
the
trail
be
warriors
coming
after
that
cat
as
soon
as
he
got
his
wits
back
zogar
sent
him
after
us
the
picts
would
follow
him
but
he
leave
them
far
behind
he
circle
the
village
until
he
hit
our
trail
and
then
come
after
us
like
a
streak
they
could
keep
up
with
him
but
they
have
an
idea
as
to
our
general
direction
they
follow
listening
for
his
cry
well
they
wo
hear
that
but
they
find
the
blood
on
the
trail
and
look
around
and
find
the
body
in
the
brush
they
pick
up
our
spoor
there
if
they
can
walk
with
care
he
avoided
clinging
briars
and
branches
effortlessly
gliding
between
trees
without
touching
the
stems
and
always
planting
his
feet
in
the
places
calculated
to
show
least
evidence
of
his
passing
but
with
balthus
it
was
slower
more
laborious
work
no
sound
came
from
behind
them
they
had
covered
more
than
a
mile
when
balthus
said
zogar
sag
catch
and
train
them
for
bloodhounds
conan
shook
his
head
was
a
leopard
he
called
out
of
the
woods
balthus
persisted
he
can
order
the
beasts
to
do
his
bidding
why
does
he
rouse
them
all
and
have
them
after
us
the
forest
is
full
of
leopards
why
send
only
one
after
us
conan
did
not
reply
for
a
space
and
when
he
did
it
was
with
a
curious
reticence
ca
command
all
the
animals
only
such
as
remember
jhebbal
sag
sag
balthus
repeated
the
ancient
name
hesitantly
he
had
never
heard
it
spoken
more
than
three
or
four
times
in
his
whole
life
all
living
things
worshipped
him
that
was
long
ago
when
beasts
and
men
spoke
one
language
men
have
forgotten
him
even
the
beasts
forget
only
a
few
remember
the
men
who
remember
jhebbal
sag
and
the
beasts
who
remember
are
brothers
and
speak
the
same
tongue
balthus
did
not
reply
he
had
strained
at
a
pictish
stake
and
seen
the
nighted
jungle
give
up
its
fanged
horrors
at
a
shaman
call
men
laugh
said
conan
not
one
can
tell
me
how
zogar
sag
can
call
pythons
and
tigers
and
leopards
out
of
the
wilderness
and
make
them
do
his
bidding
they
would
say
it
is
a
lie
if
they
dared
that
the
way
with
civilized
men
when
they
ca
explain
something
by
their
science
they
refuse
to
believe
it
the
people
on
the
tauran
were
closer
to
the
primitive
than
most
aquilonians
superstitions
persisted
whose
sources
were
lost
in
antiquity
and
balthus
had
seen
that
which
still
prickled
his
flesh
he
could
not
refute
the
monstrous
thing
which
conan
words
implied
heard
that
there
an
ancient
grove
sacred
to
jhebbal
sag
somewhere
in
this
forest
said
conan
do
know
i
never
seen
it
but
more
beasts
in
this
country
than
any
i
ever
seen
others
will
be
on
our
trail
are
now
was
conan
disquieting
answer
would
never
leave
our
tracking
to
one
beast
alone
are
we
to
do
then
asked
balthus
uneasily
grasping
his
ax
as
he
stared
at
the
gloomy
arches
above
him
his
flesh
crawled
with
the
momentary
expectation
of
ripping
talons
and
fangs
leaping
from
the
shadows
conan
turned
squatted
and
with
his
knife
began
scratching
a
curious
symbol
in
the
mold
stooping
to
look
at
it
over
his
shoulder
balthus
felt
a
crawling
of
the
flesh
along
his
spine
he
knew
not
why
he
felt
no
wind
against
his
face
but
there
was
a
rustling
of
leaves
above
them
and
a
weird
moaning
swept
ghostily
through
the
branches
conan
glanced
up
inscrutably
then
rose
and
stood
staring
somberly
down
at
the
symbol
he
had
drawn
is
it
whispered
balthus
it
looked
archaic
and
meaningless
to
him
he
supposed
that
it
was
his
ignorance
of
artistry
which
prevented
his
identifying
it
as
one
of
the
conventional
designs
of
some
prevailing
culture
but
had
he
been
the
most
erudite
artist
in
the
world
he
would
have
been
no
nearer
the
solution
saw
it
carved
in
the
rock
of
a
cave
no
human
had
visited
for
a
million
years
muttered
conan
the
uninhabited
mountains
beyond
the
sea
of
vilayet
half
a
world
away
from
this
spot
later
i
saw
a
black
of
kush
scratch
it
in
the
sand
of
a
nameless
river
he
told
me
part
of
its
meaning
it
sacred
to
jhebbal
sag
and
the
creatures
which
worship
him
watch
they
drew
back
among
the
dense
foliage
some
yards
away
and
waited
in
tense
silence
to
the
east
drums
muttered
and
somewhere
to
north
and
west
other
drums
answered
balthus
shivered
though
he
knew
long
miles
of
black
forest
separated
him
from
the
grim
beaters
of
those
drums
whose
dull
pulsing
was
a
sinister
overture
that
set
the
dark
stage
for
bloody
drama
balthus
found
himself
holding
his
breath
then
with
a
slight
shaking
of
the
leaves
the
bushes
parted
and
a
magnificent
panther
came
into
view
the
moonlight
dappling
through
the
leaves
shone
on
its
glossy
coat
rippling
with
the
play
of
the
great
muscles
beneath
it
with
its
head
held
low
it
glided
toward
them
it
was
smelling
out
their
trail
then
it
halted
as
if
frozen
its
muzzle
almost
touching
the
symbol
cut
in
the
mold
for
a
long
space
it
crouched
motionless
it
flattened
its
long
body
and
laid
its
head
on
the
ground
before
the
mark
and
balthus
felt
the
short
hairs
stir
on
his
scalp
for
the
attitude
of
the
great
carnivore
was
one
of
awe
and
adoration
then
the
panther
rose
and
backed
away
carefully
belly
almost
to
the
ground
with
his
among
the
bushes
he
wheeled
as
if
in
sudden
panic
and
was
gone
like
a
flash
of
dappled
light
balthus
mopped
his
brow
with
a
trembling
hand
and
glanced
at
conan
the
barbarian
eyes
were
smoldering
with
fires
that
never
lit
the
eyes
of
men
bred
to
the
ideas
of
civilization
in
that
instant
he
was
all
wild
and
had
forgotten
the
man
at
his
side
in
his
burning
gaze
balthus
glimpsed
and
vaguely
recognized
pristine
images
and
memories
shadows
from
life
dawn
forgotten
and
repudiated
by
sophisticated
races
ancient
primeval
fantasms
unnamed
and
nameless
then
the
deeper
fires
were
masked
and
conan
was
silently
leading
the
way
deeper
into
the
forest
no
more
to
fear
from
the
beasts
he
said
after
a
while
we
left
a
sign
for
men
to
read
they
wo
follow
our
trail
very
easily
and
until
they
find
that
symbol
they
wo
know
for
sure
turned
south
even
then
it
wo
be
easy
to
smell
us
out
without
the
beasts
to
aid
them
but
the
woods
south
of
the
trail
will
be
full
of
warriors
looking
for
us
if
we
keep
moving
after
daylight
we
be
sure
to
run
into
some
of
them
as
soon
as
we
find
a
good
place
we
hide
and
wait
until
another
night
to
swing
back
and
make
the
river
we
got
to
warn
valannus
but
it
wo
help
him
any
if
we
get
ourselves
killed
valannus
the
woods
along
the
river
are
swarming
with
picts
that
why
they
got
us
zogar
brewing
no
mere
raid
this
time
done
something
no
pict
has
done
in
my
memory
united
as
many
as
fifteen
or
sixteen
clans
his
magic
did
it
they
follow
a
wizard
farther
than
they
will
a
you
saw
the
mob
in
the
village
and
there
were
hundreds
hiding
along
the
river
bank
that
you
did
see
more
coming
from
the
farther
villages
he
have
at
least
three
thousand
i
lay
in
the
bushes
and
heard
their
talk
as
they
went
past
they
mean
to
attack
the
fort
when
i
do
know
but
zogar
does
dare
delay
long
he
gathered
them
and
whipped
them
into
a
frenzy
if
he
does
lead
them
into
battle
quickly
they
fall
to
quarreling
with
one
another
they
like
tigers
do
know
whether
they
can
take
the
fort
or
not
anyway
we
got
to
get
back
across
the
river
and
give
the
warning
the
settlers
on
the
velitrium
road
must
either
get
into
the
fort
or
back
to
velitrium
while
the
picts
are
besieging
the
fort
will
range
the
road
far
to
the
east
might
even
cross
thunder
river
and
raid
the
thickly
settled
country
behind
velitrium
as
he
talked
he
was
leading
the
way
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
ancient
wilderness
presently
he
grunted
with
satisfaction
they
had
reached
a
spot
where
the
underbrush
was
more
scattered
and
an
outcropping
of
stone
was
visible
wandering
off
southward
balthus
felt
more
secure
as
they
followed
it
not
even
a
pict
could
trail
them
over
naked
rock
did
you
get
away
he
asked
presently
conan
tapped
his
and
helmet
more
borderers
would
wear
harness
there
be
fewer
skulls
hanging
on
the
but
most
men
make
noise
if
they
wear
armor
they
were
waiting
on
each
side
of
the
path
without
moving
and
when
a
pict
stands
motionless
the
very
beasts
of
the
forest
pass
him
without
seeing
him
they
seen
us
crossing
the
river
and
got
in
their
places
if
gone
into
ambush
after
we
left
the
bank
i
have
had
some
hint
of
it
but
they
were
waiting
and
not
even
a
leaf
trembled
the
devil
himself
could
have
suspected
anything
the
first
suspicion
i
had
was
when
i
heard
a
shaft
rasp
against
a
bow
as
it
was
pulled
back
i
dropped
and
yelled
for
the
men
behind
me
to
drop
but
they
were
too
slow
taken
by
surprise
like
that
of
them
fell
at
the
first
volley
that
raked
us
from
both
sides
some
of
the
arrows
crossed
the
trail
and
struck
picts
on
the
other
side
i
heard
them
howl
he
grinned
with
vicious
satisfaction
of
us
as
were
left
plunged
into
the
woods
and
closed
with
them
when
i
saw
the
others
were
all
down
or
taken
i
broke
through
and
outfooted
the
painted
devils
through
the
darkness
they
were
all
around
me
i
ran
and
crawled
and
sneaked
and
sometimes
i
lay
on
my
belly
under
the
bushes
while
they
passed
me
on
all
sides
tried
for
the
shore
and
found
it
lined
with
them
waiting
for
just
such
a
move
but
i
have
cut
my
way
through
and
taken
a
chance
on
swimming
only
i
heard
the
drums
pounding
in
the
village
and
knew
taken
somebody
alive
were
all
so
engrossed
in
zogar
magic
that
i
was
able
to
climb
the
wall
behind
the
there
was
a
warrior
supposed
to
be
watching
at
that
point
but
he
was
squatting
behind
the
hut
and
peering
around
the
corner
at
the
ceremony
i
came
up
behind
him
and
broke
his
neck
with
my
hands
before
he
knew
what
was
happening
it
was
his
spear
i
threw
into
the
snake
and
that
his
ax
you
carrying
what
was
that
that
thing
you
killed
in
the
asked
balthus
with
a
shiver
at
the
memory
of
the
horror
of
zogar
gods
one
of
jhebbal
children
that
did
remember
and
had
to
be
kept
chained
to
the
altar
a
bull
ape
the
picts
think
sacred
to
the
hairy
one
who
lives
on
the
moon
the
of
gullah
getting
light
here
a
good
place
to
hide
until
we
see
how
close
they
on
our
trail
probably
have
to
wait
until
night
to
break
back
to
the
river
a
low
hill
pitched
upward
girdled
and
covered
with
thick
trees
and
bushes
near
the
crest
conan
slid
into
a
tangle
of
jutting
rocks
crowned
by
dense
bushes
lying
among
them
they
could
see
the
jungle
below
without
being
seen
it
was
a
good
place
to
hide
or
defend
balthus
did
not
believe
that
even
a
pict
could
have
trailed
them
over
the
rocky
ground
for
the
past
four
or
five
miles
but
he
was
afraid
of
the
beasts
that
obeyed
zogar
sag
his
faith
in
the
curious
symbol
wavered
a
little
now
but
conan
had
dismissed
the
possibility
of
beasts
tracking
them
a
ghostly
whiteness
spread
through
the
dense
branches
the
patches
of
sky
visible
altered
in
hue
grew
from
pink
to
blue
balthus
felt
the
gnawing
of
hunger
though
he
had
slaked
his
thirst
at
a
stream
they
had
skirted
there
was
complete
silence
except
for
an
occasional
chirp
of
a
bird
the
drums
were
no
longer
to
be
heard
balthus
thoughts
reverted
to
the
grim
scene
before
the
were
ostrich
plumes
zogar
sag
wore
he
said
seen
them
on
the
helmets
of
knights
who
rode
from
the
east
to
visit
the
barons
of
the
marches
there
are
no
ostriches
in
this
forest
are
there
came
from
kush
answered
conan
of
here
many
marches
lies
the
seashore
ships
from
zingara
occasionally
come
and
trade
weapons
and
ornaments
and
wine
to
the
coastal
tribes
for
skins
and
copper
ore
and
gold
dust
sometimes
they
trade
ostrich
plumes
they
got
from
the
stygians
who
in
turn
got
them
from
the
black
tribes
of
kush
which
lies
south
of
stygia
the
pictish
shamans
place
great
store
by
them
but
there
much
risk
in
such
trade
the
picts
are
too
likely
to
try
to
seize
the
ship
and
the
coast
is
dangerous
to
ships
i
sailed
along
it
when
i
was
with
the
pirates
of
the
barachan
isles
which
lie
southwest
of
zingara
balthus
looked
at
his
companion
with
admiration
knew
you
had
spent
your
life
on
this
frontier
you
mentioned
several
far
places
you
traveled
widely
roamed
far
farther
than
any
other
man
of
my
race
ever
wandered
i
seen
all
the
great
cities
of
the
hyborians
the
shemites
the
stygians
and
the
hyrkanians
i
roamed
in
the
unknown
countries
south
of
the
black
kingdoms
of
kush
and
east
of
the
sea
of
vilayet
i
been
a
mercenary
captain
a
corsair
a
a
penniless
vagabond
a
general
hell
i
been
everything
except
a
king
and
i
may
be
that
before
i
die
the
fancy
pleased
him
and
he
grinned
hardly
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
stretched
his
mighty
figure
on
the
rocks
is
as
good
life
as
any
i
do
know
how
long
i
stay
on
the
frontier
a
week
a
month
a
year
i
have
a
roving
foot
but
it
as
well
on
the
border
as
anywhere
balthus
set
himself
to
watch
the
forest
below
them
momentarily
he
expected
to
see
fierce
painted
faces
thrust
through
the
leaves
but
as
the
hours
passed
no
stealthy
footfall
disturbed
the
brooding
quiet
balthus
believed
the
picts
had
missed
their
trail
and
given
up
the
chase
conan
grew
restless
should
have
sighted
parties
scouring
the
woods
for
us
if
quit
the
chase
it
because
they
after
bigger
game
they
may
be
gathering
to
cross
the
river
and
storm
the
fort
they
come
this
far
south
if
they
lost
the
trail
lost
the
trail
all
right
otherwise
they
have
been
on
our
necks
before
now
under
ordinary
circumstances
they
scour
the
woods
for
miles
in
every
direction
some
of
them
should
have
passed
within
sight
of
this
hill
they
must
be
preparing
to
cross
the
river
we
got
to
take
a
chance
and
make
for
the
river
creeping
down
the
rocks
balthus
felt
his
flesh
crawl
between
his
shoulders
as
he
momentarily
expected
a
withering
blast
of
arrows
from
the
green
masses
about
them
he
feared
that
the
picts
had
discovered
them
and
were
lying
about
in
ambush
but
conan
was
convinced
no
enemies
were
near
and
the
cimmerian
was
right
miles
to
the
south
of
the
village
grunted
conan
hit
straight
through
for
the
river
i
do
know
how
far
down
the
river
they
spread
we
hope
to
hit
it
below
them
with
haste
that
seemed
reckless
to
balthus
they
hurried
eastward
the
woods
seemed
empty
of
life
conan
believed
that
all
the
picts
were
gathered
in
the
vicinity
of
gwawela
if
indeed
they
had
not
already
crossed
the
river
he
did
not
believe
they
would
cross
in
the
daytime
however
woodsman
would
be
sure
to
see
them
and
give
the
alarm
cross
above
and
below
the
fort
out
of
sight
of
the
sentries
then
others
will
get
in
canoes
and
make
straight
across
for
the
river
wall
as
soon
as
they
attack
those
hidden
in
the
woods
on
the
east
shore
will
assail
the
fort
from
the
other
sides
they
tried
that
before
and
got
the
guts
shot
and
hacked
out
of
them
but
this
time
they
got
enough
men
to
make
a
real
onslaught
of
it
they
pushed
on
without
pausing
though
balthus
gazed
longingly
at
the
squirrels
flitting
among
the
branches
which
he
could
have
brought
down
with
a
cast
of
his
ax
with
a
sigh
he
drew
up
his
broad
belt
the
everlasting
silence
and
gloom
of
the
primitive
forest
was
beginning
to
depress
him
he
found
himself
thinking
of
the
open
groves
and
meadows
of
the
tauran
of
the
bluff
cheer
of
his
house
of
the
fat
cows
browsing
through
the
deep
lush
grass
and
the
hearty
fellowship
of
the
brawny
plowmen
and
herdsmen
he
felt
lonely
in
spite
of
his
companion
conan
was
as
much
a
part
of
this
wilderness
as
balthus
was
alien
to
it
the
cimmerian
might
have
spent
years
among
the
great
cities
of
the
world
he
might
have
walked
with
the
rulers
of
civilization
he
might
even
achieve
his
wild
whim
some
day
and
rule
as
king
of
a
civilized
nation
stranger
things
had
happened
but
he
was
no
less
a
barbarian
he
was
concerned
only
with
the
naked
fundamentals
of
life
the
warm
intimacies
of
small
kindly
things
the
sentiments
and
delicious
trivialities
that
make
up
so
much
of
civilized
men
lives
were
meaningless
to
him
a
wolf
was
no
less
a
wolf
because
a
whim
of
chance
caused
him
to
run
with
the
watchdogs
bloodshed
and
violence
and
savagery
were
the
natural
elements
of
the
life
conan
knew
he
could
not
and
would
never
understand
the
little
things
that
are
so
dear
to
civilized
men
and
women
the
shadows
were
lengthening
when
they
reached
the
river
and
peered
through
the
masking
bushes
they
could
see
up
and
down
the
river
for
about
a
mile
each
way
the
sullen
stream
lay
bare
and
empty
conan
scowled
across
at
the
other
shore
got
to
take
another
chance
here
we
got
to
swim
the
river
we
do
know
whether
they
crossed
or
not
the
woods
over
there
may
be
alive
with
them
we
got
to
risk
it
we
about
six
miles
south
of
gwawela
he
wheeled
and
ducked
as
a
twanged
something
like
a
white
flash
of
light
streaked
through
the
bushes
balthus
knew
it
was
an
arrow
then
with
a
tigerish
bound
conan
was
through
the
bushes
balthus
caught
the
gleam
of
steel
as
he
whirled
his
sword
and
heard
a
death
scream
the
next
instant
he
had
broken
through
the
bushes
after
the
cimmerian
a
pict
with
a
shattered
skull
lay
on
the
ground
his
fingers
spasmodically
clawing
at
the
grass
half
a
dozen
others
were
swarming
about
conan
swords
and
axes
lifted
they
had
cast
away
their
bows
useless
at
such
deadly
close
quarters
their
lower
jaws
were
painted
white
contrasting
vividly
with
their
dark
faces
and
the
designs
on
their
muscular
breasts
differed
from
any
balthus
had
ever
seen
one
of
them
hurled
his
ax
at
balthus
and
rushed
after
it
with
lifted
knife
balthus
ducked
and
then
caught
the
wrist
that
drove
the
knife
licking
at
his
throat
they
went
to
the
ground
together
rolling
over
and
over
the
pict
was
like
a
wild
beast
his
muscles
hard
as
steel
strings
balthus
was
striving
to
maintain
his
hold
on
the
wild
man
wrist
and
bring
his
own
ax
into
play
but
so
fast
and
furious
was
the
struggle
that
each
attempt
to
strike
was
blocked
the
pict
was
wrenching
furiously
to
free
his
knife
hand
was
clutching
at
balthus
ax
and
driving
his
knees
at
the
youth
groin
suddenly
he
attempted
to
shift
his
knife
to
his
free
hand
and
in
that
instant
balthus
struggling
up
on
one
knee
split
the
painted
head
with
a
desperate
blow
of
his
ax
he
sprang
up
and
glared
wildly
about
for
his
companion
expecting
to
see
him
overwhelmed
by
numbers
then
he
realized
the
full
strength
and
ferocity
of
the
cimmerian
conan
bestrode
two
of
his
attackers
shorn
half
asunder
by
that
terrible
broadsword
as
balthus
looked
he
saw
the
cimmerian
beat
down
a
thrusting
shortsword
avoid
the
stroke
of
an
ax
with
a
sidewise
spring
which
brought
him
within
arm
length
of
a
squat
savage
stooping
for
a
bow
before
the
pict
could
straighten
the
red
sword
flailed
down
and
clove
him
from
shoulder
to
where
the
blade
stuck
the
remaining
warriors
rushed
in
one
from
either
side
balthus
hurled
his
ax
with
an
accuracy
that
reduced
the
attackers
to
one
and
conan
abandoning
his
efforts
to
free
his
sword
wheeled
and
met
the
remaining
pict
with
his
bare
hands
the
stocky
warrior
a
head
shorter
than
his
tall
enemy
leaped
in
striking
with
his
ax
at
the
same
time
stabbing
murderously
with
his
knife
the
knife
broke
on
the
cimmerian
mail
and
the
ax
checked
in
midair
as
conan
fingers
locked
like
iron
on
the
descending
arm
a
bone
snapped
loudly
and
balthus
saw
the
pict
wince
and
falter
the
next
instant
he
was
swept
off
his
feet
lifted
high
above
the
cimmerian
head
he
writhed
in
midair
for
an
instant
kicking
and
thrashing
and
then
was
dashed
headlong
to
the
earth
with
such
force
that
he
rebounded
and
then
lay
still
his
limp
posture
telling
of
splintered
limbs
and
a
broken
spine
on
conan
wrenched
his
sword
free
and
snatched
up
an
ax
a
bow
and
a
handful
of
arrows
and
hurry
we
got
to
trust
to
our
heels
again
that
yell
was
heard
they
be
here
in
no
time
if
we
tried
to
swim
now
they
feather
us
with
arrows
before
we
reached
midstream
red
axes
of
the
border
conan
did
not
plunge
deeply
into
the
forest
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
river
he
altered
his
slanting
course
and
ran
parallel
with
it
balthus
recognized
a
grim
determination
not
to
be
hunted
away
from
the
river
which
they
must
cross
if
they
were
to
warn
the
men
in
the
fort
behind
them
rose
more
loudly
the
yells
of
the
forest
men
balthus
believed
the
picts
had
reached
the
glade
where
the
bodies
of
the
slain
men
lay
then
further
yells
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
savages
were
streaming
into
the
woods
in
pursuit
they
had
left
a
trail
any
pict
could
follow
conan
increased
his
speed
and
balthus
grimly
set
his
teeth
and
kept
on
his
heels
though
he
felt
he
might
collapse
any
time
it
seemed
centuries
since
he
had
eaten
last
he
kept
going
more
by
an
effort
of
will
than
anything
else
his
blood
was
pounding
so
furiously
in
his
eardrums
that
he
was
not
aware
when
the
yells
died
out
behind
them
conan
halted
suddenly
balthus
leaned
against
a
tree
and
panted
quit
grunted
the
cimmerian
scowling
up
on
us
gasped
balthus
conan
shook
his
head
short
chase
like
this
they
yell
every
step
of
the
way
no
gone
back
i
thought
i
heard
somebody
yelling
behind
them
a
few
seconds
before
the
noise
began
to
get
dimmer
they
been
recalled
and
good
for
us
but
damned
bad
for
the
men
in
the
fort
it
means
the
warriors
are
being
summoned
out
of
the
woods
for
the
attack
these
men
we
ran
into
were
warriors
from
a
tribe
down
the
river
they
were
undoubtedly
headed
for
gwawela
to
join
in
the
assault
on
the
fort
damn
it
we
farther
away
than
ever
now
we
got
to
get
across
the
river
turning
east
he
hurried
through
the
thickets
with
no
attempt
at
concealment
balthus
followed
him
for
the
first
time
feeling
the
sting
of
lacerations
on
his
breast
and
shoulder
where
the
pict
savage
teeth
had
scored
him
he
was
pushing
through
the
thick
bushes
that
fringed
the
bank
when
conan
pulled
him
back
then
he
heard
a
rhythmic
splashing
and
peering
through
the
leaves
saw
a
dugout
canoe
coming
up
the
river
its
single
occupant
paddling
hard
against
the
current
he
was
a
strongly
built
pict
with
a
white
heron
feather
thrust
in
a
copper
band
that
confined
his
mane
a
gwawela
man
muttered
conan
from
zogar
white
plume
shows
that
he
carried
a
peace
talk
to
the
tribes
down
the
river
and
now
he
trying
to
get
back
and
take
a
hand
in
the
slaughter
the
lone
ambassador
was
now
almost
even
with
their
and
suddenly
balthus
almost
jumped
out
of
his
skin
at
his
very
ear
had
sounded
the
harsh
gutturals
of
a
pict
then
he
realized
that
conan
had
called
to
the
paddler
in
his
own
tongue
the
man
started
scanned
the
bushes
and
called
back
something
then
cast
a
startled
glance
across
the
river
bent
low
and
sent
the
canoe
shooting
in
toward
the
western
bank
not
understanding
balthus
saw
conan
take
from
his
hand
the
bow
he
had
picked
up
in
the
glade
and
notch
an
arrow
the
pict
had
run
his
canoe
in
close
to
the
shore
and
staring
up
into
the
bushes
called
out
something
his
answer
came
in
the
twang
of
the
the
streaking
flight
of
the
arrow
that
sank
to
the
feathers
in
his
broad
breast
with
a
choking
gasp
he
slumped
sidewise
and
rolled
into
the
shallow
water
in
an
instant
conan
was
down
the
bank
and
wading
into
the
water
to
grasp
the
drifting
canoe
balthus
stumbled
after
him
and
somewhat
dazedly
crawled
into
the
canoe
conan
scrambled
in
seized
the
paddle
and
sent
the
craft
shooting
toward
the
eastern
shore
balthus
noted
with
envious
admiration
the
play
of
the
great
muscles
beneath
the
skin
the
cimmerian
seemed
an
iron
man
who
never
knew
fatigue
did
you
say
to
the
pict
asked
balthus
him
to
pull
into
shore
said
there
was
a
white
forest
runner
on
the
bank
who
was
trying
to
get
a
shot
at
him
does
seem
fair
balthus
objected
thought
a
friend
was
speaking
to
him
you
mimicked
a
pict
perfectly
needed
his
boat
grunted
conan
not
pausing
in
his
exertions
way
to
lure
him
to
the
bank
which
is
worse
to
betray
a
pict
enjoy
skinning
us
both
alive
or
betray
the
men
across
the
river
whose
lives
depend
on
our
getting
over
balthus
mulled
over
this
delicate
ethical
question
for
a
moment
then
shrugged
his
shoulder
and
asked
far
are
we
from
the
fort
conan
pointed
to
a
creek
which
flowed
into
black
river
from
the
east
a
few
hundred
yards
below
them
south
creek
it
ten
miles
from
its
mouth
to
the
fort
it
the
southern
boundary
of
conajohara
marshes
miles
wide
south
of
it
no
danger
of
a
raid
from
across
them
nine
miles
above
the
fort
north
creek
forms
the
other
boundary
marshes
beyond
that
too
that
why
an
attack
must
come
from
the
west
across
black
river
conajohara
just
like
a
spear
with
a
point
nineteen
miles
wide
thrust
into
the
pictish
wilderness
do
we
keep
to
the
canoe
and
make
the
trip
by
water
considering
the
current
we
got
to
brace
and
the
bends
in
the
river
we
can
go
faster
afoot
besides
remember
gwawela
is
south
of
the
fort
if
the
picts
are
crossing
the
river
we
run
right
into
them
dusk
was
gathering
as
they
stepped
upon
the
eastern
bank
without
pause
conan
pushed
on
northward
at
a
pace
that
made
balthus
sturdy
legs
ache
wanted
a
fort
built
at
the
mouths
of
north
and
south
creeks
grunted
the
cimmerian
the
river
could
be
patrolled
constantly
but
the
government
would
do
it
fools
sitting
on
velvet
cushions
with
naked
girls
offering
them
iced
wine
on
their
knees
i
know
the
breed
they
ca
see
any
farther
than
their
palace
wall
diplomacy
hell
they
fight
picts
with
theories
of
territorial
expansion
valannus
and
men
like
him
have
to
obey
the
orders
of
a
set
of
damned
fools
they
never
grab
any
more
pictish
land
any
more
than
they
ever
rebuild
venarium
the
time
may
come
when
they
see
the
barbarians
swarming
over
the
walls
of
the
eastern
cities
a
week
before
balthus
would
have
laughed
at
any
such
preposterous
suggestion
now
he
made
no
reply
he
had
seen
the
unconquerable
ferocity
of
the
men
who
dwelt
beyond
the
frontiers
he
shivered
casting
glances
at
the
sullen
river
just
visible
through
the
bushes
at
the
arches
of
the
trees
which
crowded
close
to
its
banks
he
kept
remembering
that
the
picts
might
have
crossed
the
river
and
be
lying
in
ambush
between
them
and
the
fort
it
was
fast
growing
dark
a
slight
sound
ahead
of
them
jumped
his
heart
into
his
throat
and
conan
sword
gleamed
in
the
air
he
lowered
it
when
a
dog
a
great
gaunt
scarred
beast
slunk
out
of
the
bushes
and
stood
staring
at
them
dog
belonged
to
a
settler
who
tried
to
build
his
cabin
on
the
bank
of
the
river
a
few
miles
south
of
the
fort
grunted
conan
picts
slipped
over
and
killed
him
of
course
and
burned
his
cabin
we
found
him
dead
among
the
embers
and
the
dog
lying
senseless
among
three
picts
he
killed
he
was
almost
cut
to
pieces
we
took
him
to
the
fort
and
dressed
his
wounds
but
after
he
recovered
he
took
to
the
woods
and
turned
wild
what
now
slasher
are
you
hunting
the
men
who
killed
your
master
the
massive
head
swung
from
side
to
side
and
the
eyes
glowed
greenly
he
did
not
growl
or
bark
silently
as
a
phantom
he
slid
in
behind
them
him
come
muttered
conan
can
smell
the
devils
before
we
can
see
them
balthus
smiled
and
laid
his
hand
caressingly
on
the
dog
head
the
lips
involuntarily
writhed
back
to
display
the
gleaming
fangs
then
the
great
beast
bent
his
head
sheepishly
and
his
tail
moved
with
jerky
uncertainty
as
if
the
owner
had
almost
forgotten
the
emotions
of
friendliness
balthus
mentally
compared
the
great
gaunt
hard
body
with
the
fat
sleek
hounds
tumbling
vociferously
over
one
another
in
his
father
kennel
yard
he
sighed
the
frontier
was
no
less
hard
for
beasts
than
for
men
this
dog
had
almost
forgotten
the
meaning
of
kindness
and
friendliness
slasher
glided
ahead
and
conan
let
him
take
the
lead
the
last
tinge
of
dusk
faded
into
stark
darkness
the
miles
fell
away
under
their
steady
feet
slasher
seemed
voiceless
suddenly
he
halted
tense
ears
lifted
an
instant
later
the
men
heard
it
a
demoniac
yelling
up
the
river
ahead
of
them
faint
as
a
whisper
conan
swore
like
a
madman
attacked
the
fort
we
too
late
come
on
he
increased
his
pace
trusting
to
the
dog
to
smell
out
ambushes
ahead
in
a
flood
of
tense
excitement
balthus
forgot
his
hunger
and
weariness
the
yells
grew
louder
as
they
advanced
and
above
the
devilish
screaming
they
could
hear
the
deep
shouts
of
the
soldiers
just
as
balthus
began
to
fear
they
would
run
into
the
savages
who
seemed
to
be
howling
just
ahead
of
them
conan
swung
away
from
the
river
in
a
wide
semicircle
that
carried
them
to
a
low
rise
from
which
they
could
look
over
the
forest
they
saw
the
fort
lighted
with
torches
thrust
over
the
parapets
on
long
poles
these
cast
a
flickering
uncertain
light
over
the
clearing
and
in
that
light
they
saw
throngs
of
naked
painted
figures
along
the
fringe
of
the
clearing
the
river
swarmed
with
canoes
the
picts
had
the
fort
completely
surrounded
an
incessant
hail
of
arrows
rained
against
the
stockade
from
the
woods
and
the
river
the
deep
twanging
of
the
rose
above
the
howling
yelling
like
wolves
several
hundred
naked
warriors
with
axes
in
their
hands
ran
from
under
the
trees
and
raced
toward
the
eastern
gate
they
were
within
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
of
their
objective
when
a
withering
blast
of
arrows
from
the
wall
littered
the
ground
with
corpses
and
sent
the
survivors
fleeing
back
to
the
trees
the
men
in
the
canoes
rushed
their
boats
toward
the
and
were
met
by
another
shower
of
clothyard
shafts
and
a
volley
from
the
small
ballistas
mounted
on
towers
on
that
side
of
the
stockade
stones
and
logs
whirled
through
the
air
and
splintered
and
sank
half
a
dozen
canoes
killing
their
occupants
and
the
other
boats
drew
back
out
of
range
a
deep
roar
of
triumph
rose
from
the
walls
of
the
fort
answered
by
bestial
howling
from
all
quarters
we
try
to
break
through
asked
balthus
trembling
with
eagerness
conan
shook
his
head
he
stood
with
his
arms
folded
his
head
slightly
bent
a
somber
and
brooding
figure
fort
doomed
the
picts
are
and
wo
stop
until
they
all
killed
and
there
are
too
many
of
them
for
the
men
in
the
fort
to
kill
we
could
break
through
and
if
we
did
we
could
do
nothing
but
die
with
valannus
nothing
we
can
do
but
save
our
own
hides
then
we
got
to
warn
the
settlers
do
you
know
why
the
picts
are
not
trying
to
burn
the
fort
with
because
they
do
want
a
flame
that
might
warn
the
people
to
the
east
they
plan
to
stamp
out
the
fort
and
then
sweep
east
before
anyone
knows
of
its
fall
they
may
cross
thunder
river
and
take
velitrium
before
the
people
know
happened
at
least
they
destroy
every
living
thing
between
the
fort
and
thunder
river
failed
to
warn
the
fort
and
i
see
now
it
would
have
done
no
good
if
we
had
succeeded
the
fort
too
poorly
manned
a
few
more
charges
and
the
picts
will
be
over
the
walls
and
breaking
down
the
gates
but
we
can
start
the
settlers
toward
velitrium
come
on
we
outside
the
circle
the
picts
have
thrown
around
the
fort
we
keep
clear
of
it
they
swung
out
in
a
wide
arc
hearing
the
rising
and
falling
of
the
volume
of
the
yells
marking
each
charge
and
repulse
the
men
in
the
fort
were
holding
their
own
but
the
shrieks
of
the
picts
did
not
diminish
in
savagery
they
vibrated
with
a
timbre
that
held
assurance
of
ultimate
victory
before
balthus
realized
they
were
close
to
it
they
broke
into
the
road
leading
east
run
grunted
conan
balthus
set
his
teeth
it
was
nineteen
miles
to
velitrium
a
good
five
to
scalp
creek
beyond
which
began
the
settlements
it
seemed
to
the
aquilonian
that
they
had
been
fighting
and
running
for
centuries
but
the
nervous
excitement
that
rioted
through
his
blood
stimulated
him
to
herculean
efforts
slasher
ran
ahead
of
them
his
head
to
the
ground
snarling
low
the
first
sound
they
had
heard
from
him
ahead
of
us
snarled
conan
dropping
to
one
knee
and
scanning
the
ground
in
the
starlight
he
shook
his
head
baffled
ca
tell
how
many
probably
only
a
small
party
some
that
could
wait
to
take
the
fort
they
gone
ahead
to
butcher
the
settlers
in
their
beds
come
on
ahead
of
them
presently
they
saw
a
small
blaze
through
the
trees
and
heard
a
wild
and
ferocious
chanting
the
trail
bent
there
and
leaving
it
they
cut
across
the
bend
through
the
thickets
a
few
moments
later
they
were
looking
on
a
hideous
sight
an
stood
in
the
road
piled
with
meager
household
furnishings
it
was
burning
the
oxen
lay
near
with
their
throats
cut
a
man
and
a
woman
lay
in
the
road
stripped
and
mutilated
five
picts
were
dancing
about
them
with
fantastic
leaps
and
bounds
waving
bloody
axes
one
of
them
brandished
the
gown
at
the
sight
a
red
haze
swam
before
balthus
lifting
his
bow
he
lined
the
prancing
figure
black
against
the
fire
and
loosed
the
slayer
leaped
convulsively
and
fell
dead
with
the
arrow
through
his
heart
then
the
two
white
men
and
the
dog
were
upon
the
startled
survivors
conan
was
animated
merely
by
his
fighting
spirit
and
an
old
old
racial
hate
but
balthus
was
afire
with
wrath
he
met
the
first
pict
to
oppose
him
with
a
ferocious
swipe
that
split
the
painted
skull
and
sprang
over
his
falling
body
to
grapple
with
the
others
but
conan
had
already
killed
one
of
the
two
he
had
chosen
and
the
leap
of
the
aquilonian
was
a
second
late
the
warrior
was
down
with
the
long
sword
through
him
even
as
balthus
ax
was
lifted
turning
toward
the
remaining
pict
balthus
saw
slasher
rise
from
his
victim
his
great
jaws
dripping
blood
balthus
said
nothing
as
he
looked
down
at
the
pitiful
forms
in
the
road
beside
the
burning
wain
both
were
young
the
woman
little
more
than
a
girl
by
some
whim
of
chance
the
picts
had
left
her
face
unmarred
and
even
in
the
agonies
of
an
awful
death
it
was
beautiful
but
her
soft
young
body
had
been
hideously
slashed
with
many
knives
a
mist
clouded
balthus
eyes
and
he
swallowed
chokingly
the
tragedy
momentarily
overcame
him
he
felt
like
falling
upon
the
ground
and
weeping
and
biting
the
earth
young
couple
just
hitting
out
on
their
own
conan
was
saying
as
he
wiped
his
sword
unemotionally
their
way
to
the
fort
when
the
picts
met
them
maybe
the
boy
was
going
to
enter
the
service
maybe
take
up
land
on
the
river
well
that
what
will
happen
to
every
man
woman
and
child
this
side
of
thunder
river
if
we
do
get
them
into
velitrium
in
a
hurry
balthus
knees
trembled
as
he
followed
conan
but
there
was
no
hint
of
weakness
in
the
long
easy
stride
of
the
cimmerian
there
was
a
kinship
between
him
and
the
great
gaunt
brute
that
glided
beside
him
slasher
no
longer
growled
with
his
head
to
the
trail
the
way
was
clear
before
them
the
yelling
on
the
river
came
faintly
to
them
but
balthus
believed
the
fort
was
still
holding
conan
halted
suddenly
with
an
oath
he
showed
balthus
a
trail
that
led
north
from
the
road
it
was
an
old
trail
partly
grown
with
new
young
growth
and
this
growth
had
recently
been
broken
down
balthus
realized
this
fact
more
by
feel
than
sight
though
conan
seemed
to
see
like
a
cat
in
the
dark
the
cimmerian
showed
him
where
broad
wagon
tracks
turned
off
the
main
trail
deeply
indented
in
the
forest
mold
going
to
the
licks
after
salt
he
grunted
at
the
edges
of
the
marsh
about
nine
miles
from
here
blast
it
they
be
cut
off
and
butchered
to
a
man
listen
one
man
can
warn
the
people
on
the
road
go
ahead
and
wake
them
up
and
herd
them
into
velitrium
i
go
and
get
the
men
gathering
the
salt
they
be
camped
by
the
licks
we
wo
come
back
to
the
road
we
head
straight
through
the
woods
with
no
further
comment
conan
turned
off
the
trail
and
hurried
down
the
dim
path
and
balthus
after
staring
after
him
for
a
few
moments
set
out
along
the
road
the
dog
had
remained
with
him
and
glided
softly
at
his
heels
when
balthus
had
gone
a
few
rods
he
heard
the
animal
growl
whirling
he
glared
back
the
way
he
had
come
and
was
startled
to
see
a
vague
ghostly
glow
vanishing
into
the
forest
in
the
direction
conan
had
taken
slasher
rumbled
deep
in
his
throat
his
hackles
stiff
and
his
eyes
balls
of
green
fire
balthus
remembered
the
grim
apparition
that
had
taken
the
head
of
the
merchant
tiberias
not
far
from
that
spot
and
he
hesitated
the
thing
must
be
following
conan
but
the
giant
cimmerian
had
repeatedly
demonstrated
his
ability
to
take
care
of
himself
and
balthus
felt
his
duty
lay
toward
the
helpless
settlers
who
slumbered
in
the
path
of
the
red
hurricane
the
horror
of
the
fiery
phantom
was
overshadowed
by
the
horror
of
those
limp
violated
bodies
beside
the
burning
he
hurried
down
the
road
crossed
scalp
creek
and
came
in
sight
of
the
first
settler
cabin
a
long
low
structure
of
logs
in
an
instant
he
was
pounding
on
the
door
a
sleepy
voice
inquired
his
pleasure
up
the
picts
are
over
the
river
that
brought
instant
response
a
low
cry
echoed
his
words
and
then
the
door
was
thrown
open
by
a
woman
in
a
scanty
shift
her
hair
hung
over
her
bare
shoulders
in
disorder
she
held
a
candle
in
one
hand
and
an
ax
in
the
other
her
face
was
colorless
her
eyes
wide
with
terror
in
she
begged
hold
the
cabin
we
must
make
for
velitrium
the
fort
ca
hold
them
back
it
may
have
fallen
already
do
stop
to
dress
get
your
children
and
come
on
my
man
gone
with
the
others
after
salt
she
wailed
wringing
her
hands
behind
her
peered
three
tousled
youngsters
blinking
and
bewildered
gone
after
them
he
fetch
them
through
safe
we
must
hurry
up
the
road
to
warn
the
other
cabins
relief
flooded
her
countenance
be
thanked
she
cried
the
cimmerian
gone
after
them
they
safe
if
mortal
man
can
save
them
in
a
whirlwind
of
activity
she
snatched
up
the
smallest
child
and
herded
the
others
through
the
door
ahead
of
her
balthus
took
the
candle
and
ground
it
out
under
his
heel
he
listened
an
instant
no
sound
came
up
the
dark
road
you
got
a
horse
the
stable
she
groaned
hurry
he
pushed
her
aside
as
she
fumbled
with
shaking
hands
at
the
bars
he
led
the
horse
out
and
lifted
the
children
on
its
back
telling
them
to
hold
to
its
mane
and
to
one
another
they
stared
at
him
seriously
making
no
outcry
the
woman
took
the
horse
halter
and
set
out
up
the
road
she
still
gripped
her
ax
and
balthus
knew
that
if
cornered
she
would
fight
with
the
desperate
courage
of
a
he
held
behind
listening
he
was
oppressed
by
the
belief
that
the
fort
had
been
stormed
and
taken
that
the
hordes
were
already
streaming
up
the
road
toward
velitrium
drunken
on
slaughter
and
mad
for
blood
they
would
come
with
the
speed
of
starving
wolves
presently
they
saw
another
cabin
looming
ahead
the
woman
started
to
shriek
a
warning
but
balthus
stopped
her
he
hurried
to
the
door
and
knocked
a
woman
voice
answered
him
he
repeated
his
warning
and
soon
the
cabin
disgorged
its
occupants
an
old
woman
two
young
women
and
four
children
like
the
other
woman
husband
their
men
had
gone
to
the
salt
licks
the
day
before
unsuspecting
of
any
danger
one
of
the
young
women
seemed
dazed
the
other
prone
to
hysteria
but
the
old
woman
a
stern
old
veteran
of
the
frontier
quieted
them
harshly
she
helped
balthus
get
out
the
two
horses
that
were
stabled
in
a
pen
behind
the
cabin
and
put
the
children
on
them
balthus
urged
that
she
herself
mount
with
them
but
she
shook
her
head
and
made
one
of
the
younger
women
ride
with
child
grunted
the
old
woman
can
walk
and
fight
too
if
it
comes
to
that
as
they
set
out
one
of
the
women
said
young
couple
passed
along
the
road
about
dusk
we
advised
them
to
spend
the
night
at
our
cabin
but
they
were
anxious
to
make
the
fort
tonight
did
did
met
the
picts
answered
balthus
briefly
and
the
woman
sobbed
in
horror
they
were
scarcely
out
of
sight
of
the
cabin
when
some
distance
behind
them
quavered
a
long
yell
wolf
exclaimed
one
of
the
women
painted
wolf
with
an
ax
in
his
hand
muttered
balthus
rouse
the
other
settlers
along
the
road
and
take
them
with
you
i
scout
along
behind
without
a
word
the
old
woman
herded
her
charges
ahead
of
her
as
they
faded
into
the
darkness
balthus
could
see
the
pale
ovals
that
were
the
faces
of
the
children
twisted
back
over
their
shoulders
to
stare
toward
him
he
remembered
his
own
people
on
the
tauran
and
a
moment
giddy
sickness
swam
over
him
with
momentary
weakness
he
groaned
and
sank
down
in
the
road
his
muscular
arm
fell
over
slasher
massive
neck
and
he
felt
the
dog
warm
moist
tongue
touch
his
face
he
lifted
his
head
and
grinned
with
a
painful
effort
on
boy
he
mumbled
rising
got
work
to
do
a
red
glow
suddenly
became
evident
through
the
trees
the
picts
had
fired
the
last
hut
he
grinned
how
zogar
sag
would
froth
if
he
knew
his
warriors
had
let
their
destructive
natures
get
the
better
of
them
the
fire
would
warn
the
people
farther
up
the
road
they
would
be
awake
and
alert
when
the
fugitives
reached
them
but
his
face
grew
grim
the
women
were
traveling
slowly
on
foot
and
on
the
overloaded
horses
the
picts
would
run
them
down
within
a
mile
unless
he
took
his
position
behind
a
tangle
of
fallen
logs
beside
the
trail
the
road
west
of
him
was
lighted
by
the
burning
cabin
and
when
the
picts
came
he
saw
them
first
black
furtive
figures
etched
against
the
distant
glare
drawing
a
shaft
to
the
head
he
loosed
and
one
of
the
figures
crumpled
the
rest
melted
into
the
woods
on
either
side
of
the
road
slasher
whimpered
with
the
killing
lust
beside
him
suddenly
a
figure
appeared
on
the
fringe
of
the
trail
under
the
trees
and
began
gliding
toward
the
fallen
timbers
balthus
twanged
and
the
pict
yelped
staggered
and
fell
into
the
shadows
with
the
arrow
through
his
thigh
slasher
cleared
the
timbers
with
a
bound
and
leaped
into
the
bushes
they
were
violently
shaken
and
then
the
dog
slunk
back
to
balthus
side
his
jaws
crimson
no
more
appeared
in
the
trail
balthus
began
to
fear
they
were
stealing
past
his
position
through
the
woods
and
when
he
heard
a
faint
sound
to
his
left
he
loosed
blindly
he
cursed
as
he
heard
the
shaft
splinter
against
a
tree
but
slasher
glided
away
as
silently
as
a
phantom
and
presently
balthus
heard
a
thrashing
and
a
gurgling
then
slasher
came
like
a
ghost
through
the
bushes
snuggling
his
great
head
against
balthus
arm
blood
oozed
from
a
gash
in
his
shoulder
but
the
sounds
in
the
wood
had
ceased
for
ever
the
men
lurking
on
the
edges
of
the
road
evidently
sensed
the
fate
of
their
companion
and
decided
that
an
open
charge
was
preferable
to
being
dragged
down
in
the
dark
by
a
they
could
neither
see
nor
hear
perhaps
they
realized
that
only
one
man
lay
behind
the
logs
they
came
with
a
sudden
rush
breaking
cover
from
both
sides
of
the
trail
three
dropped
with
arrows
through
them
and
the
remaining
pair
hesitated
one
turned
and
ran
back
down
the
road
but
the
other
lunged
over
the
breastwork
his
eyes
and
teeth
gleaming
in
the
dim
light
his
ax
lifted
balthus
foot
slipped
as
he
sprang
up
but
the
slip
saved
his
life
the
descending
ax
shaved
a
lock
of
hair
from
his
head
and
the
pict
rolled
down
the
logs
from
the
force
of
his
wasted
blow
before
he
could
regain
his
feet
slasher
tore
his
throat
out
then
followed
a
tense
period
of
waiting
in
which
time
balthus
wondered
if
the
man
who
had
fled
had
been
the
only
survivor
of
the
party
obviously
it
had
been
a
small
band
that
had
either
left
the
fighting
at
the
fort
or
was
scouting
ahead
of
the
main
body
each
moment
that
passed
increased
the
chances
for
safety
of
the
women
and
children
hurrying
toward
velitrium
then
without
warning
a
shower
of
arrows
whistled
over
his
retreat
a
wild
howling
rose
from
the
woods
along
the
trail
either
the
survivor
had
gone
after
aid
or
another
party
had
joined
the
first
the
burning
cabin
still
smoldered
lending
a
little
light
then
they
were
after
him
gliding
through
the
trees
beside
the
trail
he
shot
three
arrows
and
threw
the
bow
away
as
if
sensing
his
plight
they
came
on
not
yelling
now
but
in
deadly
silence
except
for
a
swift
pad
of
many
feet
he
fiercely
hugged
the
head
of
the
great
dog
growling
at
his
side
muttered
right
boy
give
hell
and
sprang
to
his
feet
drawing
his
ax
then
the
dark
figures
flooded
over
the
breastworks
and
closed
in
a
storm
of
flailing
axes
stabbing
knives
and
ripping
fangs
the
devil
in
the
fire
when
conan
turned
from
the
velitrium
road
he
expected
a
run
of
some
nine
miles
and
set
himself
to
the
task
but
he
had
not
gone
four
when
he
heard
the
sounds
of
a
party
of
men
ahead
of
him
from
the
noise
they
were
making
in
their
progress
he
knew
they
were
not
picts
he
hailed
them
there
challenged
a
harsh
voice
where
you
are
until
we
know
you
or
you
get
an
arrow
through
you
could
hit
an
elephant
in
this
darkness
answered
conan
impatiently
on
fool
it
i
conan
the
picts
are
over
the
river
suspected
as
much
answered
the
leader
of
the
men
as
they
strode
forward
tall
rangy
men
with
bows
in
their
hands
of
our
party
wounded
an
antelope
and
tracked
it
nearly
to
black
river
he
heard
them
yelling
down
the
river
and
ran
back
to
our
camp
we
left
the
salt
and
the
wagons
turned
the
oxen
loose
and
came
as
swiftly
as
we
could
if
the
picts
are
besieging
the
fort
will
be
ranging
up
the
road
toward
our
cabins
families
are
safe
grunted
conan
companion
went
ahead
to
take
them
to
velitrium
if
we
go
back
to
the
main
road
we
may
run
into
the
whole
horde
we
strike
southeast
through
the
timber
go
ahead
i
scout
behind
a
few
moments
later
the
whole
band
was
hurrying
southeastward
conan
followed
more
slowly
keeping
just
within
he
cursed
the
noise
they
were
making
that
many
picts
or
cimmerians
would
have
moved
through
the
woods
with
no
more
noise
than
the
wind
makes
as
it
blows
through
the
black
branches
he
had
just
crossed
a
small
glade
when
he
wheeled
answering
the
conviction
of
his
primitive
instincts
that
he
was
being
followed
standing
motionless
among
the
bushes
he
heard
the
sounds
of
the
retreating
settlers
fade
away
then
a
voice
called
faintly
back
along
the
way
he
had
come
conan
wait
for
me
conan
he
swore
bewilderedly
cautiously
he
called
i
am
for
me
conan
the
voice
came
more
distinctly
conan
moved
out
of
the
shadows
scowling
the
devil
are
you
doing
here
crom
he
half
crouched
the
flesh
prickling
along
his
spine
it
was
not
balthus
who
was
emerging
from
the
other
side
of
the
glade
a
weird
glow
burned
through
the
trees
it
moved
toward
him
shimmering
weirdly
a
green
that
moved
with
purpose
and
intent
it
halted
some
feet
away
and
conan
glared
at
it
trying
to
distinguish
its
outlines
the
quivering
flame
had
a
solid
core
the
flame
was
but
a
green
garment
that
masked
some
animate
and
evil
entity
but
the
cimmerian
was
unable
to
make
out
its
shape
or
likeness
then
shockingly
a
voice
spoke
to
him
from
amidst
the
fiery
column
do
you
stand
like
a
sheep
waiting
for
the
butcher
conan
the
voice
was
human
but
carried
strange
vibrations
that
were
not
human
conan
wrath
got
the
best
of
his
momentary
awe
you
think
i
afraid
of
a
damned
pictish
swamp
devil
a
friend
called
me
called
in
his
voice
answered
the
other
men
you
follow
belong
to
my
brother
i
would
not
rob
his
knife
of
their
blood
but
you
are
mine
oh
fool
you
have
come
from
the
far
gray
hills
of
cimmeria
to
meet
your
doom
in
the
forests
of
conajohara
had
your
chance
at
me
before
now
snorted
conan
you
kill
me
then
if
you
could
brother
had
not
painted
a
skull
black
for
you
and
hurled
it
into
the
fire
that
burns
for
ever
on
gullah
black
altar
he
had
not
whispered
your
name
to
the
black
ghosts
that
haunt
the
uplands
of
the
dark
land
but
a
bat
has
flown
over
the
mountains
of
the
dead
and
drawn
your
image
in
blood
on
the
white
tiger
hide
that
hangs
before
the
long
hut
where
sleep
the
four
brothers
of
the
night
the
great
serpents
coil
about
their
feet
and
the
stars
burn
like
in
their
hair
have
the
gods
of
darkness
doomed
me
to
death
growled
conan
something
a
hand
foot
or
talon
he
could
not
tell
which
thrust
out
from
the
fire
and
marked
swiftly
on
the
mold
a
symbol
blazed
there
marked
with
fire
and
faded
but
not
before
he
recognized
it
dared
make
the
sign
which
only
a
priest
of
jhebbal
sag
dare
make
thunder
rumbled
through
the
black
mountain
of
the
dead
and
the
of
gullah
was
thrown
down
by
a
wind
from
the
gulf
of
ghosts
the
loon
which
is
messenger
to
the
four
brothers
of
the
night
flew
swiftly
and
whispered
your
name
in
my
ear
your
head
will
hang
in
the
of
my
brother
your
body
will
be
eaten
by
the
children
of
jhil
the
devil
is
your
brother
demanded
conan
his
sword
was
naked
in
his
hand
and
he
was
subtly
loosening
the
ax
in
his
belt
sag
a
child
of
jhebbal
sag
who
still
visits
his
sacred
groves
at
times
a
woman
of
gwawela
slept
in
a
grove
holy
to
jhebbal
sag
her
babe
was
zogar
sag
i
too
am
a
son
of
jhebbal
sag
out
of
a
from
a
far
realm
zogar
sag
summoned
me
out
of
the
misty
lands
with
incantations
and
sorcery
and
his
own
blood
he
materialized
me
in
the
flesh
of
his
own
planet
we
are
one
tied
together
by
invisible
threads
his
thoughts
are
my
thoughts
if
he
is
struck
i
am
bruised
if
i
am
cut
he
bleeds
but
i
have
talked
enough
soon
your
ghost
will
talk
with
the
ghosts
of
the
dark
land
and
they
will
tell
you
of
the
old
gods
which
are
not
dead
but
sleep
in
the
outer
abysses
and
from
time
to
time
awake
like
to
see
what
you
look
like
muttered
conan
working
his
ax
free
who
leave
a
track
like
a
bird
who
burn
like
a
flame
and
yet
speak
with
a
human
voice
shall
see
answered
the
voice
from
the
flame
and
carry
the
knowledge
with
you
into
the
dark
land
the
flames
leaped
and
sank
dwindling
and
dimming
a
face
began
to
take
shadowy
form
at
first
conan
thought
it
was
zogar
sag
himself
who
stood
wrapped
in
green
fire
but
the
face
was
higher
than
his
own
and
there
was
a
demoniac
aspect
about
it
conan
had
noted
various
abnormalities
about
zogar
sag
features
an
obliqueness
of
the
eyes
a
sharpness
of
the
ears
a
wolfish
thinness
of
the
lips
these
peculiarities
were
exaggerated
in
the
apparition
which
swayed
before
him
the
eyes
were
red
as
coals
of
living
fire
more
details
came
into
view
a
slender
torso
covered
with
snaky
scales
which
was
yet
in
shape
with
arms
from
the
waist
upward
below
long
legs
ended
in
splay
feet
like
those
of
some
huge
bird
along
the
monstrous
limbs
the
blue
fire
fluttered
and
ran
he
saw
it
as
through
a
glistening
mist
then
suddenly
it
was
towering
over
him
though
he
had
not
seen
it
move
toward
him
a
long
arm
which
for
the
first
time
he
noticed
was
armed
with
curving
talons
swung
high
and
swept
down
at
his
neck
with
a
fierce
cry
he
broke
the
spell
and
bounded
aside
hurling
his
ax
the
demon
avoided
the
cast
with
an
unbelievably
quick
movement
of
its
narrow
head
and
was
on
him
again
with
a
hissing
rush
of
leaping
flames
but
fear
had
fought
for
it
when
it
slew
its
other
victims
and
conan
was
not
afraid
he
knew
that
any
being
clothed
in
material
flesh
can
be
slain
by
material
weapons
however
grisly
its
form
may
be
one
flailing
limb
knocked
his
helmet
from
his
head
a
little
lower
and
it
would
have
decapitated
him
but
fierce
joy
surged
through
him
as
his
savagely
driven
sword
sank
deep
in
the
monster
groin
he
bounded
backward
from
a
flailing
stroke
tearing
his
sword
free
as
he
leaped
the
talons
raked
his
breast
ripping
through
as
if
they
had
been
cloth
but
his
return
spring
was
like
that
of
a
starving
wolf
he
was
inside
the
lashing
arms
and
driving
his
sword
deep
in
the
monster
belly
felt
the
arms
lock
about
him
and
the
talons
ripping
the
mail
from
his
back
as
they
sought
his
vitals
he
was
lapped
and
dazzled
by
blue
flame
that
was
chill
as
ice
then
he
had
torn
fiercely
away
from
the
weakening
arms
and
his
sword
cut
the
air
in
a
tremendous
swipe
the
demon
staggered
and
fell
sprawling
sidewise
its
head
hanging
only
by
a
shred
of
flesh
the
fires
that
veiled
it
leaped
fiercely
upward
now
red
as
gushing
blood
hiding
the
figure
from
view
a
scent
of
burning
flesh
filled
conan
nostrils
shaking
the
blood
and
sweat
from
his
eyes
he
wheeled
and
ran
staggering
through
the
woods
blood
trickled
down
his
limbs
somewhere
miles
to
the
south
he
saw
the
faint
glow
of
flames
that
might
mark
a
burning
cabin
behind
him
toward
the
road
rose
a
distant
howling
that
spurred
him
to
greater
efforts
conajohara
no
more
there
had
been
fighting
on
thunder
river
fierce
fighting
before
the
walls
of
velitrium
ax
and
torch
had
been
piled
up
and
down
the
bank
and
many
a
settler
cabin
lay
in
ashes
before
the
painted
horde
was
rolled
back
a
strange
quiet
followed
the
storm
in
which
people
gathered
and
talked
in
hushed
voices
and
men
with
bandages
drank
their
ale
silently
in
the
taverns
along
the
river
bank
there
to
conan
the
cimmerian
moodily
quaffing
from
a
great
came
a
gaunt
forester
with
a
bandage
about
his
head
and
his
arm
in
a
sling
he
was
the
one
survivor
of
fort
tuscelan
went
with
the
soldiers
to
the
ruins
of
the
fort
conan
nodded
was
able
murmured
the
other
was
no
fighting
picts
had
fallen
back
across
the
black
river
something
must
have
broken
their
nerve
though
only
the
devil
who
made
them
knows
what
the
woodsman
glanced
at
his
bandaged
arm
and
sighed
say
there
were
no
bodies
worth
disposing
of
conan
shook
his
head
the
picts
had
piled
them
in
the
fort
and
set
fire
to
the
fort
before
they
crossed
the
river
their
own
dead
and
the
men
of
valannus
was
killed
among
the
last
in
the
fighting
when
they
broke
the
barriers
they
tried
to
take
him
alive
but
he
made
them
kill
him
they
took
ten
of
the
rest
of
us
prisoners
when
we
were
so
weak
from
fighting
we
could
fight
no
more
they
butchered
nine
of
us
then
and
there
it
was
when
zogar
sag
died
that
i
got
my
chance
to
break
free
and
run
for
it
sag
dead
ejaculated
conan
i
saw
him
die
that
why
the
picts
did
press
the
fight
against
velitrium
as
fiercely
as
they
did
against
the
fort
it
was
strange
he
took
no
wounds
in
battle
he
was
dancing
among
the
slain
waving
an
ax
with
which
he
just
brained
the
last
of
my
comrades
he
came
at
me
howling
like
a
wolf
and
then
he
staggered
and
dropped
the
ax
and
began
to
reel
in
a
circle
screaming
as
i
never
heard
a
man
or
beast
scream
before
he
fell
between
me
and
the
fire
they
built
to
roast
me
gagging
and
frothing
at
the
mouth
and
all
at
once
he
went
rigid
and
the
picts
shouted
that
he
was
dead
it
was
during
the
confusion
that
i
slipped
my
cords
and
ran
for
the
woods
saw
him
lying
in
the
firelight
no
weapon
had
touched
him
yet
there
were
red
marks
like
the
wounds
of
a
sword
in
the
groin
belly
and
neck
the
last
as
if
his
head
had
been
almost
severed
from
his
body
what
do
you
make
of
that
conan
made
no
reply
and
the
forester
aware
of
the
reticence
of
barbarians
on
certain
matters
continued
lived
by
magic
and
somehow
he
died
by
magic
it
was
the
mystery
of
his
death
that
took
the
heart
out
of
the
picts
not
a
man
who
saw
it
was
in
the
fighting
before
velitrium
they
hurried
back
across
black
river
those
that
struck
thunder
river
were
warriors
who
had
come
on
before
zogar
sag
died
they
were
not
enough
to
take
the
city
by
themselves
came
along
the
road
behind
their
main
force
and
i
know
none
followed
me
from
the
fort
i
sneaked
through
their
lines
and
got
into
the
town
you
brought
the
settlers
through
all
right
but
their
women
and
children
got
into
velitrium
just
ahead
of
those
painted
devils
if
the
youth
balthus
and
old
slasher
had
held
them
up
awhile
have
butchered
every
woman
and
child
in
conajohara
i
passed
the
place
where
balthus
and
the
dog
made
their
last
stand
they
were
lying
amid
a
heap
of
dead
picts
i
counted
seven
brained
by
his
ax
or
disemboweled
by
the
dog
fangs
and
there
were
others
in
the
road
with
arrows
sticking
in
them
gods
what
a
fight
that
must
have
been
was
a
man
said
conan
drink
to
his
shade
and
to
the
shade
of
the
dog
who
knew
no
fear
he
quaffed
part
of
the
wine
then
emptied
the
rest
upon
the
floor
with
a
curious
heathen
gesture
and
smashed
the
goblet
heads
of
ten
picts
shall
pay
for
his
and
seven
heads
for
the
dog
who
was
a
better
warrior
than
many
a
man
and
the
forester
staring
into
the
moody
smoldering
blue
eyes
knew
the
barbaric
oath
would
be
kept
not
rebuild
the
fort
conajohara
is
lost
to
aquilonia
the
frontier
has
been
pushed
back
thunder
river
will
be
the
new
border
the
woodsman
sighed
and
stared
at
his
calloused
hand
worn
from
contact
with
and
conan
reached
his
long
arm
for
the
the
forester
stared
at
him
comparing
him
with
the
men
about
them
the
men
who
had
died
along
the
lost
river
comparing
him
with
those
other
wild
men
over
that
river
conan
did
not
seem
aware
of
his
gaze
is
the
natural
state
of
mankind
the
borderer
said
still
staring
somberly
at
the
cimmerian
is
unnatural
it
is
a
whim
of
circumstance
and
barbarism
must
always
ultimately
triumph
