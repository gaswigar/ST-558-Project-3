yesterday
i
wrote
formally
rising
to
the
occasion
like
the
conventional
happy
father
rather
than
the
man
who
believes
in
the
miracle
and
lives
for
it
yesterday
i
stinted
myself
i
took
you
in
my
arms
glad
of
what
is
and
stately
with
respect
for
the
fulness
of
your
manhood
it
is
that
i
let
myself
leap
into
yours
in
a
passion
of
joy
i
dwell
on
what
has
come
to
pass
and
inflate
myself
with
pride
in
your
fulfilment
more
as
a
mother
would
i
think
and
she
your
mother
but
why
did
you
not
write
before
after
all
the
great
event
was
not
when
you
found
your
offer
of
marriage
accepted
but
when
you
found
you
had
fallen
in
love
then
was
your
hour
then
was
the
time
for
congratulation
when
the
call
was
first
sounded
and
the
reveille
of
time
and
about
fell
upon
your
soul
and
the
march
to
another
destiny
was
begun
it
is
always
more
important
to
love
than
to
be
loved
i
wish
it
had
been
vouchsafed
me
to
be
by
when
your
spirit
of
a
sudden
grew
willing
to
bestow
itself
without
question
or
let
or
hope
of
return
when
the
self
broke
up
and
you
grew
fain
to
beat
out
your
strength
in
praise
and
service
for
the
woman
who
was
soaring
high
in
the
blue
wastes
you
have
known
her
long
and
you
must
have
been
hers
long
yet
no
word
of
her
and
of
your
love
reached
me
it
was
not
kind
to
be
silent
barbara
spoke
yesterday
of
your
fastidiousness
and
we
told
each
other
that
you
had
gained
a
triumph
of
happiness
in
your
love
for
you
are
not
of
those
who
cheat
themselves
you
choose
rigorously
straining
for
the
heart
of
the
end
as
do
all
rigorists
who
are
also
hedonists
because
we
are
in
possession
of
this
bit
of
data
as
to
your
temperamental
cosmos
we
can
congratulate
you
with
the
more
abandon
oh
herbert
do
you
know
that
this
is
a
rampant
spring
and
that
on
leaving
barbara
i
tramped
out
of
the
confines
into
the
green
happier
it
almost
seems
than
i
have
ever
been
do
you
know
that
because
you
love
a
woman
and
she
loves
you
and
that
because
you
are
swept
along
by
certain
forces
that
i
am
happy
and
feel
myself
in
sight
of
my
portion
of
immortality
on
earth
far
more
than
because
of
my
books
dear
lad
far
more
i
wish
i
could
fly
england
and
get
to
you
should
i
have
a
shade
less
of
you
than
formerly
if
we
were
together
now
from
your
too
much
green
of
wealth
a
barrenness
of
friendship
it
does
not
matter
what
is
her
gain
can
not
be
my
loss
one
power
is
mine
without
hindrance
in
freedom
and
in
right
to
say
to
ellen
son
godspeed
to
place
hester
hand
in
his
and
bid
them
forth

september
here
i
am
back
in
the
old
quarters
once
more
with
the
old
afternoon
climb
across
the
campus
and
up
into
the
sky
up
to
the
old
rooms
the
old
books
and
the
old
view
you
poor
dane
kempton
could
you
but
have
lounged
with
me
on
the
window
couch
an
hour
past
and
watched
the
light
pass
out
of
the
day
through
the
golden
gate
and
the
night
creep
over
the
berkeley
hills
and
down
out
of
the
east
why
should
you
linger
on
there
in
london
town
we
grow
away
from
each
other
it
seems
you
with
your
i
with
my
joyful
science
poesy
and
economics
alack
alack
how
did
i
escape
you
dane
when
mind
and
mood
you
mastered
me
the
auguries
were
fair
i
too
should
have
been
a
singer
and
lo
i
strive
for
science
all
my
boyhood
was
singing
what
of
you
and
my
father
was
a
singer
too
in
his
own
fine
way
dear
to
me
is
your
likening
of
him
to
what
become
of
waring
he
waring
i
can
think
of
him
only
as
one
who
went
away
chose
land
travel
or
seafaring
gwynne
says
i
am
sometimes
almost
a
poet
gwynne
you
know
arthur
gwynne
who
has
come
to
live
with
me
at
the
ridge
if
it
were
not
for
your
dismal
science
he
is
sure
to
add
and
to
fire
him
i
lay
it
to
the
defects
of
early
training
i
know
he
thinks
that
i
never
half
appreciated
you
and
that
i
do
not
appreciate
you
now
if
you
will
recollect
you
praised
his
verses
once
he
cherishes
that
praise
amongst
his
sweetest
treasures
poor
dear
good
old
gwynne
tender
sensitive
shrinking
with
the
face
of
a
seraph
and
the
heart
of
a
maid
never
were
two
men
more
incongruously
companioned
i
love
him
for
himself
he
tolerates
me
i
do
secretly
believe
because
of
you
he
longs
to
meet
you
he
knew
you
well
through
my
father
and
we
often
talk
you
over
be
sure
at
every
opportunity
i
tear
off
your
halo
and
trundle
it
about
trust
me
you
receive
scant
courtesy
how
i
wander
on
my
pen
is
unruly
after
the
long
vacation
my
thought
yet
wayward
what
of
the
fever
of
successful
wooing
and
besides
how
shall
i
say
such
was
the
gracious
warmth
of
your
letter
of
both
your
letters
that
i
am
at
a
loss
i
feel
weak
inadequate
it
almost
seems
as
though
you
had
made
a
demand
upon
something
that
is
not
in
me
ah
you
poets
it
would
seem
your
delight
in
my
marriage
were
greater
than
mine
in
my
present
mood
it
is
you
who
are
young
you
who
love
i
who
have
lived
and
am
old
yes
i
am
going
to
be
married
at
this
present
moment
i
doubt
not
a
million
men
and
women
are
saying
the
same
thing
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
princes
and
potentates
maidens
and
hussies
all
saying
i
am
going
to
be
married
and
all
looking
forward
to
it
as
a
crisis
in
their
lives
no
after
all
marriage
is
the
way
of
the
world
considered
biologically
it
is
an
institution
necessary
for
the
perpetuation
of
the
species
why
should
it
be
a
crisis
these
million
men
and
women
will
marry
and
the
work
of
the
world
go
on
just
as
it
did
before
shuffle
them
about
and
the
work
of
the
world
would
yet
go
on
true
a
month
ago
it
did
seem
a
crisis
i
wrote
you
as
much
it
did
seem
a
disturbing
element
in
my
one
can
not
view
with
equanimity
that
which
appears
to
be
totally
disruptive
of
one
dear
little
system
of
living
but
it
only
appeared
so
i
lacked
perspective
that
was
all
as
i
look
upon
it
now
everything
fits
well
and
all
will
run
smoothly
i
am
sure
you
know
i
had
two
years
yet
to
work
for
my
doctorate
i
still
have
them
as
you
see
i
am
back
to
the
old
quarters
settled
down
in
the
old
groove
hammering
away
at
the
old
grind
nothing
is
changed
and
besides
my
own
studies
i
have
taken
up
an
assistant
instructorship
in
the
department
of
economics
it
is
an
ambitious
course
and
an
important
one
i
do
know
how
they
ever
came
to
confide
it
to
me
or
how
i
found
the
temerity
to
attempt
it
which
is
neither
here
nor
there
it
is
all
agreed
hester
is
a
sensible
girl
the
engagement
is
to
be
long
i
shall
continue
my
career
as
charted
two
years
from
now
when
i
shall
have
become
a
doctor
of
social
sciences
and
candidate
for
numerous
other
things
i
shall
also
become
a
benedict
my
marriage
and
the
presumably
necessary
honeymoon
chime
in
with
the
summer
vacation
there
is
no
disturbing
element
even
there
oh
we
are
very
practical
hester
and
i
and
we
are
both
strong
enough
to
lead
each
our
own
lives
which
reminds
me
that
you
have
not
asked
about
her
first
let
me
shock
you
she
too
is
a
scientist
it
was
in
my
undergraduate
days
that
we
met
and
ere
the
struck
we
were
quarrelling
felicitously
over
weismann
and
the
i
was
at
berkeley
at
the
time
a
cocksure
junior
and
she
far
maturer
as
a
freshman
was
at
stanford
carrying
more
culture
with
her
into
her
university
than
is
given
the
average
student
to
carry
out
next
and
here
your
arms
open
to
her
she
is
a
poet
she
is
a
poet
this
must
be
always
understood
she
is
the
greater
poet
i
take
it
in
this
dawning
twentieth
century
because
she
is
a
scientist
not
in
spite
of
being
a
scientist
as
some
would
hold
how
shall
i
describe
her
perhaps
as
a
george
eliot
fused
with
an
elizabeth
barrett
with
a
hint
of
huxley
and
a
trace
of
keats
i
may
say
she
is
something
like
all
this
but
i
must
say
she
is
something
other
and
different
there
is
about
her
a
certain
lightsomeness
a
glow
or
flash
almost
latin
or
oriental
or
perhaps
celtic
yes
that
must
be
it
celtic
but
the
norman
is
there
and
the
stubborn
saxon
her
quickness
and
fine
audacity
are
checked
and
poised
as
it
were
by
that
certain
conservatism
which
gives
stability
to
purpose
and
power
to
achievement
she
is
unafraid
and
and
but
she
is
not
the
saxon
grapples
with
the
celt
and
the
norman
forces
the
twain
to
do
what
the
one
would
not
dream
of
doing
and
what
the
other
would
dream
beyond
and
never
do
do
you
catch
me
her
most
salient
charm
is
i
think
her
perfect
poise
her
exquisite
adjustment
altogether
she
is
a
most
wonderful
woman
take
my
word
for
it
and
after
all
she
is
described
vicariously
though
she
has
published
nothing
and
is
exceeding
shy
i
shall
send
you
some
of
her
work
there
will
you
find
and
know
her
she
is
waiting
for
stronger
voice
and
sings
softly
as
yet
but
hers
will
be
no
minor
note
no
middle
flight
she
is
well
she
is
hester
in
two
years
we
shall
be
married
two
years
dane
surely
you
will
be
with
us
one
thing
more
in
your
letter
a
certain
undertone
which
i
could
not
fail
to
detect
a
shade
less
of
me
than
formerly
i
turn
and
look
into
your
face
waring
handiwork
you
remember
his
painter
fancy
of
you
in
those
golden
days
when
i
stood
on
the
brink
of
the
world
and
you
showed
me
the
delights
of
the
world
and
the
way
of
my
feet
therein
so
i
turn
and
look
and
look
and
wonder
shade
of
me
of
you
poesy
and
economics
where
lies
the
blame
herbert
iii
from
dane
kempton
to
herbert
wace
london
september
it
is
because
you
know
not
what
you
do
that
i
can
not
forgive
you
could
you
know
that
your
letter
with
its
catalogue
of
advantages
and
arrangements
must
offend
me
as
much
as
it
belies
let
us
hope
you
and
the
woman
of
your
love
i
would
pardon
the
affront
of
it
upon
us
all
and
ascribe
the
unseemly
want
of
warmth
to
reserve
or
to
the
sadness
which
grips
the
heart
when
joy
is
too
palpitant
but
something
warns
me
that
you
are
unaware
of
the
chill
your
words
breathe
and
that
is
a
lapse
which
it
is
impossible
to
meet
with
indulgence
he
does
not
love
her
was
barbara
quick
decision
and
she
laid
the
open
letter
down
with
a
definiteness
which
said
that
you
too
are
laid
out
and
laid
low
your
sister
very
wrists
can
be
articulate
however
i
laughed
at
her
and
she
soon
joined
me
we
do
not
mean
to
be
extravagant
with
our
fears
who
shall
prescribe
the
letters
of
lovers
to
their
sisters
and
yet
there
are
some
things
their
letters
should
be
incapable
of
saying
and
amongst
them
that
love
is
not
a
crisis
and
a
rebirth
but
that
it
is
common
as
the
commonplace
a
hit
or
miss
affair
which
shuffling
could
not
affect
barbara
showed
me
your
note
to
her
had
i
written
like
this
of
myself
and
earl
you
could
not
i
objected
then
herbert
should
have
been
as
little
able
to
do
it
she
deduced
with
emphasis
here
i
might
have
told
her
that
men
and
women
are
races
apart
but
no
one
talks
cant
to
barbara
so
i
did
not
console
her
and
it
stands
against
you
in
our
minds
that
on
this
critical
occasion
you
have
baffled
us
with
coldness
an
absence
of
six
years
broken
into
twice
by
a
brief
few
months
must
work
changes
when
barbara
called
your
letter
unnatural
she
forgot
how
little
she
knows
what
is
natural
to
you
she
and
i
have
been
wont
to
predetermine
you
your
character
foothold
and
outlook
by
say
by
the
fact
that
you
knew
your
wordsworth
and
that
you
knew
him
without
being
able
to
take
for
yourself
his
austere
peace
youth
which
lives
by
hope
is
riven
by
unrest
i
made
no
vows
vows
were
made
for
me
bond
unknown
to
me
was
given
that
i
should
be
else
sinning
gently
a
dedicated
spirit
that
pale
sunrise
seen
from
mt
tamalpais
and
your
voice
vibrant
to
fierceness
on
the
else
sinning
gently
to
me
the
splendour
of
rose
on
ridges
of
mist
spoke
all
for
you
so
dear
have
you
always
been
it
rested
on
the
possible
wonder
of
your
life
it
threw
you
into
the
scintillant
dawn
with
an
abandon
meet
to
a
son
of
waring
tell
me
do
you
still
read
your
wordsworth
on
your
knees
i
am
bent
with
regret
for
the
time
when
your
mind
had
no
surprises
for
me
when
the
days
were
flushed
halcyon
with
my
hope
in
you
i
resent
your
development
if
it
is
because
of
it
that
you
speak
prosaically
of
a
prosaic
marriage
and
of
a
honeymoon
simultaneous
with
the
degree
i
think
you
are
too
well
pleased
with
the
simultaneousness
yet
the
fact
of
the
letter
is
fair
it
can
not
be
that
the
soul
of
it
is
not
hester
stebbins
is
a
poet
i
lean
forward
and
think
it
out
as
i
did
some
days
ago
when
the
news
came
i
conjure
up
the
look
of
love
if
the
woman
is
content
how
much
more
than
content
the
feeling
she
bounds
with
in
knowing
you
hers
as
she
is
yours
what
better
test
that
all
is
well
i
conjure
up
the
look
of
love
it
is
thus
at
meeting
and
thus
at
parting
even
here
when
all
is
chill
and
hard
to
understand
i
catch
the
flash
and
the
warmth
and
what
i
see
restores
you
to
me
but
how
deep
the
plummet
of
my
mind
needed
to
sound
before
it
reached
you
it
is
because
you
permitted
yourself
to
speak
when
silence
had
expressed
you
better
show
me
the
ideally
real
hester
stebbins
the
spark
of
fire
which
is
she
the
storms
have
not
broken
over
her
head
she
will
laugh
and
make
poetry
of
her
laughter
if
before
she
met
you
she
wept
that
too
will
help
the
smiling
there
is
laughter
which
is
the
echo
of
a
miserere
sobbed
by
the
ages
men
chuckle
in
the
irony
of
pain
and
they
smile
cold
lessoned
smiles
in
resignation
they
laugh
in
forgetfulness
and
they
laugh
lest
they
die
of
sadness
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
a
widening
of
the
lips
a
heaving
forth
of
sound
and
the
life
is
saved
the
remedy
is
as
drastic
as
are
the
drugs
used
for
epilepsy
which
in
quelling
the
spasm
bring
idiocy
to
the
patient
if
we
are
made
idiots
by
our
laughter
we
are
paying
dearly
for
the
privilege
of
continuing
in
life
hester
shall
laugh
because
she
is
glad
and
must
tell
her
joy
and
she
will
not
lose
it
in
the
telling
greet
her
for
me
and
hasten
to
prove
yourself
for
the
poet
gentle
creature
that
he
is
hath
like
the
lover
his
unruly
times
his
fits
when
he
is
neither
sick
nor
well
though
no
distress
be
near
him
but
his
own
unmanageable
thoughts
you
will
judge
by
this
letter
that
i
am
neither
sick
nor
well
and
that
i
reach
for
a
distress
which
is
not
near
if
i
were
merchant
rather
than
poet
it
would
be
otherwise
with
me
dane
iv
from
herbert
wace
to
dane
kempton
the
ridge
berkeley
california
october
do
i
still
read
my
wordsworth
on
my
knees
well
we
may
as
well
have
it
out
i
have
foreseen
this
day
so
long
and
shunned
it
that
now
i
meet
it
almost
with
extended
hands
no
i
do
not
read
my
wordsworth
on
my
knees
my
mind
is
filled
with
other
things
i
have
not
the
time
i
am
not
the
herbert
wace
of
six
years
gone
it
is
fair
that
you
should
know
this
fair
also
that
you
should
know
the
herbert
wace
of
six
years
gone
was
not
quite
the
lad
you
deemed
him
there
is
no
more
pathetic
and
terrible
thing
than
the
prejudice
of
love
both
you
and
i
have
suffered
from
it
six
years
ago
ay
and
before
that
i
felt
and
resented
the
growing
difference
between
us
when
under
your
spell
it
seemed
that
i
was
born
to
lisp
in
numbers
and
devote
myself
to
singing
that
the
world
was
good
and
all
of
it
fit
for
singing
but
away
from
you
even
then
doubts
faced
me
and
i
knew
in
vague
fashion
that
we
lived
in
different
worlds
at
first
in
vague
fashion
i
say
and
when
with
you
again
your
spell
dominated
me
and
i
could
not
question
you
were
true
you
were
good
i
argued
all
that
was
wonderful
and
glorious
therefore
you
were
also
right
you
mastered
me
with
your
charm
as
you
were
wont
to
master
those
who
loved
you
but
there
came
times
when
your
sympathy
failed
me
and
i
stood
alone
on
outlooks
i
had
achieved
alone
there
was
no
response
from
you
i
could
not
hear
your
voice
i
looked
down
upon
a
real
world
you
were
caught
up
in
a
beautiful
cloudland
and
shut
away
from
me
possibly
it
was
because
life
of
itself
appealed
to
you
while
to
me
appealed
the
mechanics
of
life
but
be
it
as
it
may
yours
was
a
world
of
ideas
and
fancies
mine
a
world
of
things
and
facts
enters
here
the
prejudice
of
love
it
was
the
lad
that
discovered
our
difference
and
concealed
it
was
the
man
who
was
blind
and
could
not
discover
there
we
erred
man
and
boy
and
here
both
men
now
we
make
all
well
again
let
me
be
explicit
do
you
remember
the
passion
with
which
i
read
the
intellectual
development
of
europe
i
understood
not
the
tithe
of
it
but
i
was
thrilled
my
common
sense
was
thrilled
i
suppose
but
it
was
all
very
joyous
gripping
hold
of
the
tangible
world
for
the
first
time
and
when
i
came
to
you
warm
with
the
glow
of
adventure
you
looked
blankly
then
smiled
indulgently
and
did
not
answer
you
regarded
my
ardour
complacently
a
passing
humour
of
adolescence
you
thought
and
i
thought
dane
does
not
read
his
draper
on
his
knees
wordsworth
was
great
to
me
draper
was
great
also
you
had
no
patience
with
him
and
i
know
now
as
i
felt
then
your
consistent
revolt
against
his
materialistic
philosophy
only
the
other
day
you
complained
of
a
letter
of
mine
calling
it
cold
and
analytical
that
i
should
be
cold
and
analytical
despite
all
the
prodding
and
pressing
and
moulding
i
have
received
at
your
hands
and
the
hands
of
waring
marks
only
more
clearly
our
temperamental
difference
but
it
does
not
mark
that
one
or
the
other
of
us
is
less
a
dedicated
spirit
if
i
have
wandered
away
from
the
warmth
of
poesy
and
become
practical
have
you
not
remained
and
become
confirmed
in
all
that
is
beautifully
impractical
if
i
have
adventured
in
a
new
world
of
common
things
have
you
not
lingered
in
the
old
world
of
great
and
impossible
things
if
i
have
shivered
in
the
gray
dawn
of
a
new
day
have
you
not
crouched
over
the
dying
embers
of
the
fire
of
yesterday
ah
dane
you
can
not
rekindle
that
fire
the
whirl
of
the
world
scatters
its
ashes
wide
and
far
like
volcanic
dust
to
make
beautiful
crimson
sunsets
for
a
time
and
then
to
vanish
none
the
less
are
you
a
dedicated
spirit
priest
that
you
are
of
a
dying
faith
your
prayers
are
futile
your
altars
crumbling
and
the
light
flickers
and
drops
down
into
night
poetry
is
empty
these
days
empty
and
worthless
and
dead
all
the
epic
and
will
not
put
this
very
miserable
earth
of
ours
to
rights
so
long
as
the
singers
sing
of
the
things
of
yesterday
glorifying
the
things
of
yesterday
and
lamenting
their
departure
so
long
will
poetry
be
a
vain
thing
and
without
avail
the
old
world
is
dead
dead
and
buried
along
with
its
heroes
and
helens
and
knights
and
ladies
and
tournaments
and
pageants
you
can
not
sing
of
the
truth
and
wonder
of
in
terms
of
yesterday
and
no
one
will
listen
to
your
singing
till
you
sing
of
in
terms
of
this
is
the
day
of
the
common
man
do
you
glorify
the
common
man
this
is
the
day
of
the
machine
when
have
you
sung
of
the
machine
the
crusades
are
here
again
not
the
crusades
of
christ
but
the
crusades
of
the
machine
have
you
found
motive
in
them
for
your
song
we
are
crusading
not
for
the
remission
of
sins
but
for
the
abolition
of
sinning
of
economic
and
industrial
sinning
the
crusade
to
sepulchre
was
paltry
compared
with
the
splendour
and
might
of
our
crusade
toward
manhood
there
are
millions
of
us
afoot
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
have
you
never
listened
to
the
trampling
of
our
feet
and
been
caught
up
by
the
glory
and
the
romance
of
it
oh
dane
dane
our
captains
sit
in
council
our
heroes
take
the
field
our
fighting
men
are
buckling
on
their
harness
our
martyrs
have
already
died
and
you
are
blind
to
it
blind
to
it
all
we
have
no
poets
these
days
and
perforce
we
are
singing
with
our
hands
the
walking
delegate
is
a
greater
singer
and
a
finer
singer
than
you
dane
kempton
the
cold
analytical
economist
delving
in
the
dynamics
of
society
is
more
the
prophet
than
you
the
carpenter
at
his
bench
the
blacksmith
by
his
forge
the
clanging
and
clattering
are
all
warbling
more
sweetly
than
you
the
pours
out
more
strength
and
certitude
and
joy
in
every
blow
than
do
you
in
your
whole
sheaf
of
songs
why
the
very
socialist
agitator
hustled
by
the
police
on
a
street
corner
amid
the
jeers
of
the
mob
has
caught
the
romance
of
as
you
have
not
caught
it
and
where
you
have
missed
it
he
knows
life
and
is
living
are
you
living
dane
kempton
forgive
me
i
had
begun
to
explain
and
reconcile
our
difference
i
find
i
am
lecturing
and
censuring
you
in
defending
myself
i
offend
but
this
i
wish
to
say
we
are
so
made
you
and
i
that
your
function
in
life
is
to
dream
mine
to
work
that
you
failed
to
make
a
dreamer
of
me
is
no
cause
for
heartache
and
chagrin
what
of
my
practical
nature
and
analytical
mind
i
have
generalised
in
my
own
way
upon
the
data
of
life
and
achieved
a
different
code
from
yours
yet
i
seek
truth
as
passionately
as
you
i
still
believe
myself
to
be
a
dedicated
spirit
and
what
boots
it
all
of
it
when
the
last
word
is
said
we
are
two
men
by
a
thousand
ties
very
dear
to
each
other
there
is
room
in
our
hearts
for
each
other
as
there
is
room
in
the
world
for
both
of
us
though
we
have
many
things
not
in
common
yet
you
are
my
dearest
friend
on
earth
you
who
have
been
a
second
father
to
me
as
well
you
have
long
merited
this
explanation
and
it
was
cowardly
of
me
not
to
have
made
it
before
my
hope
is
that
i
have
been
sufficiently
clear
for
you
to
understand
herbert
v
from
dane
kempton
to
herbert
wace
london
a
queen
road
chelsea
november
you
sigh
poesy
and
economics
supplying
the
cause
and
thereby
admitting
the
fact
i
wish
you
had
shown
some
reluctance
to
see
my
meaning
that
you
had
preferred
to
waive
the
matter
on
the
ground
of
insufficient
data
that
you
had
been
less
eager
to
ferret
out
the
science
of
the
thing
do
you
remember
how
your
boy
respect
rose
for
little
barbara
whenever
she
cried
when
too
readily
forgiven
she
dreads
a
double
standard
you
explained
to
me
with
generous
heat
you
sympathised
with
her
fear
lest
i
demand
less
of
her
than
of
you
honouring
her
insistence
on
an
equality
of
duty
as
well
as
of
privilege
is
the
man
herbert
less
proud
than
the
child
barbara
that
you
speak
of
a
temperamental
difference
and
ask
for
a
special
dispensation
you
are
not
in
love
this
you
say
in
not
gainsaying
my
attack
on
you
and
so
far
i
understand
because
you
are
a
student
of
economics
at
the
last
i
stop
what
is
this
about
economics
and
poesy
about
your
emancipation
from
my
riotously
lyric
sway
the
hand
of
the
forces
by
which
you
have
been
moulded
can
not
detain
you
from
going
out
upon
the
the
fact
of
your
preference
for
draper
can
not
forestall
your
spirit
need
of
love
there
are
many
codes
but
there
is
one
law
binding
alike
on
the
economist
and
poet
it
springs
out
of
the
common
and
unappeasable
hunger
commanding
that
love
seek
love
through
night
to
day
and
through
day
to
night
yet
it
is
possible
to
put
oneself
outside
the
pale
of
the
law
to
refuse
the
gift
of
life
and
snap
the
tie
between
time
and
space
and
creature
it
is
possible
to
be
too
emaciated
for
interest
or
feeling
the
men
and
women
of
the
people
know
neither
love
nor
art
because
they
are
too
weary
they
lie
in
sleep
prostrate
from
great
fatigue
their
bodies
are
too
much
tried
with
the
hungers
of
the
body
and
their
spirits
too
dimly
illumined
with
the
hope
of
fair
chances
it
is
also
possible
to
fill
oneself
so
full
with
an
interest
that
all
else
is
crowded
out
you
have
done
this
like
the
cobbler
who
is
a
cobbler
typically
the
teacher
who
is
a
pedagogue
the
physician
and
the
lawyer
who
are
pathologists
merely
you
are
a
fanatic
of
a
text
you
are
in
the
toils
of
an
idea
the
idea
of
selection
as
i
well
know
and
you
exploit
it
like
a
drudge
when
a
man
finds
that
he
can
not
deal
in
petroleum
without
smelling
of
it
it
is
time
that
he
turn
to
something
else
every
man
is
engaged
in
the
cause
of
keeping
himself
whole
in
watching
himself
lest
his
man
turn
machine
in
watching
lest
the
outside
world
assail
the
inner
nature
spares
the
type
but
the
individual
must
spare
himself
he
is
strong
who
is
sensitive
and
who
responds
subtly
to
everything
in
his
environment
but
his
response
must
be
characteristic
he
must
sustain
his
personality
and
become
more
himself
through
the
years
he
alone
is
vital
in
the
social
scheme
who
lets
nothing
in
him
atrophy
and
who
persists
in
being
varied
from
all
others
in
the
scale
of
character
to
the
degree
of
variability
that
was
his
at
the
beginning
i
read
in
your
letter
nothing
but
a
decision
to
stop
short
and
give
over
as
if
you
had
strength
for
no
more
than
your
book
and
your
theory
you
have
become
slave
to
a
small
point
of
inquiry
and
you
call
it
the
advance
to
a
new
time
the
crusade
is
on
you
say
coronation
rites
for
the
commoners
and
destruction
to
superstition
i
put
my
hand
out
to
you
in
joy
the
joy
is
in
unholy
worship
of
a
fetish
the
pain
that
there
is
no
joy
also
deference
to
a
fetish
your
creed
thunders
thou
shalt
not
love
is
a
thing
of
yesterday
no
room
for
anything
that
intimately
concerns
the
self
but
what
are
the
apostles
of
the
young
thought
preaching
if
it
is
not
the
right
of
men
to
their
own
and
what
would
it
avail
them
to
come
into
their
own
if
life
be
stripped
of
romance
i
am
dissatisfied
because
you
are
willing
to
live
as
others
must
live
you
should
stay
aristocrat
ferdinand
lassalle
dressed
with
elegance
for
his
audiences
with
the
hope
he
said
of
reminding
them
that
there
was
something
better
than
their
shabbiness
you
are
of
the
favoured
herbert
it
devolves
upon
you
to
endear
your
life
to
yourself
you
do
not
agree
with
me
you
do
not
believe
that
love
is
the
law
which
controls
freedom
and
life
slave
to
your
theory
and
rebel
to
the
law
you
lose
your
soul
and
imperil
another
gently
gently
i
say
to
myself
old
sorrows
and
wrongs
oppress
me
and
i
grow
harsh
my
heat
only
helps
to
convince
you
that
my
position
is
not
based
on
the
you
hold
so
essential
and
that
therefore
it
is
unlivable
i
will
state
calmly
then
that
it
is
wrong
to
marry
without
love
for
the
perpetuation
of
the
species
that
is
noble
of
you
so
you
strip
yourself
of
the
thousand
years
of
civilisation
that
have
fostered
you
you
abandon
your
prerogative
as
a
creature
high
in
the
scale
of
existence
to
obey
an
instinct
and
fulfil
a
function
you
say
these
men
and
women
will
marry
and
the
work
of
the
world
go
on
just
as
it
did
before
shuffle
them
about
and
the
work
of
the
world
would
yet
go
on
and
you
are
content
you
feel
no
need
of
anything
different
from
this
condition
believe
me
herbert
these
million
men
and
women
will
not
let
you
shuffle
them
about
there
are
forces
stronger
than
force
shadows
more
real
than
reality
we
know
that
the
need
of
the
unhungered
for
the
one
friend
one
comrade
one
mate
is
good
we
honour
the
love
that
persists
in
loving
more
beautiful
than
starlight
is
the
face
of
the
lover
when
the
voice
and
the
vision
enfold
him
the
race
is
consecrated
to
the
worship
of
idea
and
the
lover
who
lays
his
all
on
the
altar
of
romance
which
is
idea
is
at
one
with
the
race
the
arms
of
the
unloved
girl
close
about
the
formless
air
and
more
real
than
her
loneliness
and
her
sorrow
is
the
imagined
embrace
the
awaited
warm
close
pressure
of
the
hands
the
fancied
gaze
what
does
it
mean
what
secret
was
there
for

what
for
him
in

motion
of
waters
you
can
not
explain
the
bloom
the
charm
the
smile
of
life
that
which
rains
sunshine
into
our
hearts
which
tells
us
we
are
wise
to
hope
and
to
have
faith
which
buckles
on
us
an
armour
of
activity
which
lights
the
fires
of
the
spirit
which
gives
us
godhead
and
renders
us
indomitable
comparative
anatomy
can
not
reason
it
down
it
is
sensibility
romance
idea
it
is
a
fact
of
life
toward
which
all
other
facts
make
for
the
flush
of
in
the

the
touch
of
a
hand
the
colour
and
shape
of
fruit
the
tears
that
come
for
unnamed

the

of
old
men
are
more
significant
than
all
the
building
and
inventing
done
since
the
first
social
compact
forgive
my
tediousness
i
have
flaunted
these
truisms
before
you
in
order
to
exorcise
that
modern
slang
of
yours
which
is
more
false
than
the
overstrained
forms
of
a
feudal
france
to
shut
out
glory
is
not
to
be
practical
you
are
not
adjusting
your
life
artistically
there
is
too
much
strain
too
little
warmth
too
much
i
see
that
you
are
really
younger
than
i
thought
the
world
never
censures
the
crimes
of
the
spirit
you
are
safe
from
the
world
tongue
lashings
and
in
that
safety
is
the
danger
against
which
my
friendship
warns
you
i
have
been
reading
hester
poems
and
i
know
that
she
is
like
them
nervous
vibrant
throbbing
sensitive
i
have
been
reading
your
letters
and
i
think
her
soul
will
escape
yours
if
you
have
not
love
like
hers
you
have
nothing
with
which
to
keep
her
this
i
have
undertaken
to
say
to
you
it
is
a
strange
role
yet
conventional
i
am
the
father
whose
matrimonial
whims
are
not
met
by
the
son
the
stock
measure
is
to
disinherit
but
the
cause
of
our
quarrel
is
somewhat
unusual
and
i
can
be
neither
so
practical
nor
so
vulgar
as
to
set
about
making
codicils
love
is
of
no
value
to
financiers
there
is
no
bank
for
it
nor
may
it
be
made
over
in
a
will
rather
is
it
carried
on
in
the
blood
even
as
barbara
carried
it
on
into
the
life
of
her
your
sister
keeps
me
strong
with
the
faith
of
love
may
god
be
good
to
her
it
was
five
years
ago
that
she
came
to
me
and
whispered
earl
when
she
saw
i
could
not
turn
to
her
in
joy
she
leaned
her
little
head
back
against
the
roses
of
the
porch
and
wept
more
than
was
right
i
fear
for
a
girl
just
betrothed
earl
was
a
cripple
and
poor
and
helpless
but
barbara
knew
better
than
we
for
she
knew
how
to
give
herself
poor
little
one
whom
nobody
congratulated
she
sends
you
and
hester
her
love
unfolding
you
both
in
her
eager
tenderness
dane
vi
from
the
same
to
the
same
london
november
metaphysics
is
contagious
i
caught
it
from
barbara
and
i
can
not
resist
the
impulse
to
pass
it
on
and
to
you
of
all
others
the
mood
leapt
upon
barbara
out
of
the
pages
of
katia
a
story
by
tolstoy
to
my
mind
it
is
a
painful
tale
of
lovers
who
outlive
their
love
killing
it
with
their
own
hands
but
the
author
means
it
to
be
a
happily
ending
novel
tolstoy
attempts
to
show
that
men
and
women
can
find
happiness
only
when
they
grow
content
to
give
over
seeking
love
from
one
another
they
may
keep
the
memory
but
must
banish
the
hope
hereafter
think
of
me
only
as
the
father
of
your
children
and
the
woman
who
had
pined
for
that
which
had
been
theirs
in
the
beginning
of
their
union
weeps
softly
and
agrees
tolstoy
calls
this
peace
but
for
barbara
and
me
this
gain
is
loss
this
end
an
end
indeed
replete
with
all
the
tragedy
of
ending
i
found
barbara
on
the
last
page
of
katia
and
much
disturbed
dear
i
saw
a
spirit
break
she
said
i
waited
before
asking
whose
and
when
i
did
she
answered
that
of
of
the
world
the
ghost
of
a
dream
walked
when
after
the
spirit
broke
i
saw
it
and
myself
and
my
earl
vanished
in
shadow
we
and
our
love
thinned
away
before
the
your
dreaming
barbara
can
scarce
be
better
than
your
living
we
looked
long
at
each
other
she
knew
herself
a
happy
woman
yet
the
ghost
had
walked
in
the
light
and
her
eyes
were
not
held
and
she
saw
even
her
life
was
not
sufficient
even
her
plans
were
paltry
even
her
heart
love
was
cramped
such
times
of
seeing
come
to
happy
men
and
to
happy
women
barbara
was
reading
the
opinions
of
the
world
and
the
acceptances
of
the
world
and
in
disliking
them
she
came
to
doubt
herself
perhaps
she
too
should
be
less
at
peace
she
too
may
be
amongst
pharisees
a
pharisee
in
the
midst
of
the
breaking
of
spirit
how
can
i
know
she
demanded
love
is
sure
i
prompted
my
hand
on
her
forehead
earl
and
i
are
sure
dear
she
laughed
low
and
a
drift
of
sobbing
swept
through
the
music
it
is
not
that
we
are
in
doubt
about
ourselves
but
sometimes
like
you
understand
one
finds
oneself
bitten
by
the
sharp
tooth
of
the
world
and
a
despair
courses
through
the
veins
and
blinds
the
eyes
and
then
in
the
midst
of
the
bitterest
throe
comes
a
great
visioning
i
heard
her
and
understood
and
my
heart
leapt
as
it
had
not
done
for
long
think
of
it
herbert
and
still
young
when
was
it
that
i
last
fluttered
with
joy
ah
yes
that
time
the
summer
and
the
woods
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
and
a
few
words
spoken
by
a
boy
i
think
barbara
majesty
of
attainment
through
vicarious
breaking
of
spirit
a
greater
cause
for
rejoicing
then
in
the
midst
of
the
bitterest
throe
came
a
great
when
pain
is
good
and
to
be
thanked
for
how
good
life
is
by
this
alone
may
you
know
the
proportion
and
the
value
of
the
good
of
being
of
the
world
are
broken
spirited
but
from
out
the
wreckage
a
and
it
is
well
the
vision
fastens
upon
us
and
what
was
full
seems
shrunken
what
whole
and
of
all
time
a
passing
bit
an
untraceable
flash
and
that
is
well
for
the
dream
recalls
the
hope
and
the
heart
grows
hardy
with
hoping
and
dreaming
so
barbara
and
you
you
do
not
repine
because
of
these
things
let
the
grand
mujik
mutter
a
thousand
heresies
let
of
the
world
accept
and
live
them
you
would
not
think
the
unaspiring
you
would
hail
them
right
practical
and
if
you
held
a
thought
as
firmly
as
your
sister
holds
the
thought
of
love
and
you
found
yourself
alone
in
your
esteem
of
it
you
would
part
from
it
and
go
over
to
the
others
you
would
not
be
the
fanatic
your
sister
is
to
stay
so
much
the
closer
by
it
that
of
necessity
she
must
doubt
her
own
allegiance
fearing
in
her
devotion
that
without
knowing
it
she
too
is
cold
and
but
half
alive
you
would
not
see
visions
that
would
put
your
best
to
shame
the
of
the
more
you
could
be
were
you
and
the
whole
world
finer
and
greater
would
not
walk
before
you
you
would
rest
content
and
assured
and
i
regret
your
assurance
always
yours

no
i
am
not
in
love
i
am
very
thankful
that
i
am
not
i
pride
myself
on
the
fact
as
you
say
i
may
not
be
adjusting
my
life
artistically
to
its
environment
there
is
room
for
discussion
there
but
i
do
know
that
i
am
adjusting
it
scientifically
i
am
arranging
my
life
so
that
i
may
get
the
most
out
of
it
while
the
one
thing
to
disorder
it
worse
than
flood
and
fire
and
the
public
enemy
is
love
i
have
told
you
from
time
to
time
of
my
book
i
have
decided
to
call
it
the
economic
man
i
am
going
over
the
proofs
now
and
my
brain
is
in
perfect
working
order
on
the
other
hand
there
is
professor
bidwell
who
is
likewise
correcting
proofs
poor
devil
he
is
in
despair
he
can
do
nothing
with
them
i
positively
can
not
think
he
complains
to
me
his
hair
rumpled
and
face
flushed
he
did
not
answer
my
knock
the
other
day
and
i
came
upon
him
with
the
neglected
proofs
under
his
elbows
and
his
absent
gaze
directed
through
window
and
out
of
doors
to
some
rosy
cloudland
beyond
my
ken
it
will
be
a
failure
i
know
it
will
he
growled
to
me
my
brain
is
dull
it
refuses
to
act
i
can
not
imagine
what
has
come
over
me
but
i
could
imagine
very
easily
he
is
in
love
madly
in
love
with
what
i
take
to
be
a
very
ordinary
sort
of
girl
and
expects
shortly
to
be
married
postpone
the
book
for
a
time
i
suggested
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
then
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
general
disarray
with
a
thumping
i
will
and
take
my
word
for
it
dane
a
year
hence
when
the
very
ordinary
girl
greets
him
with
the
matronly
kiss
and
his
fever
and
folly
have
left
him
he
will
take
up
the
book
and
make
a
success
of
it
of
course
i
am
not
in
love
i
have
just
come
back
from
hester
i
ran
down
saturday
to
stanford
and
stopped
over
sunday
time
did
not
pass
tediously
on
the
train
i
did
not
look
at
my
watch
every
other
minute
i
read
the
morning
papers
with
interest
and
without
impatience
the
scenery
was
charming
and
i
was
unaware
of
the
slightest
hurry
to
reach
my
destination
i
remember
noting
when
i
came
up
the
gravel
walk
between
the
that
my
heart
was
not
in
my
mouth
as
it
should
have
been
according
to
convention
in
fact
the
sun
was
uncomfortable
and
i
mopped
my
brow
and
decided
that
the
roses
stood
in
need
of
trimming
and
really
you
know
i
had
seen
brighter
days
and
fairer
views
and
the
world
in
more
beautiful
moods
and
when
hester
stood
on
the
veranda
and
held
out
her
hands
my
heart
did
not
leap
as
though
it
were
going
to
part
company
with
me
nor
was
i
dizzy
with
rapture
i
believe
nor
did
all
the
world
vanish
and
everything
blot
out
and
leave
only
hester
standing
there
lips
curved
and
arms
outstretched
in
welcome
oh
i
saw
the
curved
lips
and
outstretched
arms
and
all
the
splendid
young
womanhood
swaying
there
and
i
was
pleased
and
all
that
but
i
did
not
think
it
too
wonderful
and
impossible
and
miraculous
and
the
rest
of
the
fond
rubbish
i
am
sure
poor
bidwell
thinks
when
his
eyes
are
gladdened
by
his
ordinary
sort
of
girl
when
he
calls
upon
her
what
a
comely
young
woman
is
what
i
thought
as
i
pressed
hands
and
none
of
the
ordinary
sort
either
she
has
health
and
strength
and
beauty
and
youth
and
she
will
certainly
make
a
most
charming
wife
and
excellent
mother
thus
i
thought
and
then
we
chatted
had
lunch
and
passed
a
delightful
afternoon
together
an
afternoon
such
as
i
might
pass
with
you
or
any
good
comrade
or
with
my
wife
all
of
which
rational
rightness
is
i
know
distasteful
to
you
dane
and
i
confess
i
depict
it
with
brutal
frankness
failing
to
give
credit
to
the
gentler
tenderer
side
of
me
believe
me
i
am
very
fond
of
hester
i
respect
and
admire
her
i
am
proud
of
her
too
and
proud
of
myself
that
so
fine
a
creature
should
find
enough
in
me
to
be
willing
to
mate
with
me
it
will
be
a
happy
marriage
there
is
nothing
cramped
or
narrow
or
incompatible
about
it
we
know
each
other
well
a
wisdom
that
is
acquired
by
lovers
only
after
marriage
and
even
then
with
the
likelihood
of
it
being
a
painful
wisdom
we
on
the
other
hand
are
not
blinded
by
love
madness
and
we
see
clearly
and
sanely
and
are
confident
of
our
ability
to
live
out
the
years
together

i
have
been
thinking
about
your
romance
and
my
rational
rightness
and
so
this
letter
loves
because
he
loves
this
explanation
is
as
yet
the
most
serious
and
most
decisive
that
has
been
found
for
the
solution
of
this
i
do
not
know
who
has
said
this
but
it
might
well
have
been
you
and
you
might
well

with

i
know
not
what
which
comes
i

not
when
which

i

which
enchants
i

not
by
what
and
which
ends
i
know
not
when
or
you
explain
love
by
asserting
that
it
is
not
to
be
explained
and
therein
lies
our
difference
you
accept
results
i
search
for
causes
you
stop
at
the
gate
of
the
mystery
worshipful
and
content
i
go
on
and
through
flinging
the
gate
wide
and
formulating
the
law
of
the
mystery
which
is
a
mystery
no
longer
it
is
our
way
you
worship
the
idea
i
believe
in
the
fact
if
the
stone
fall
the
wind
blow
the
grass
and
green
things
sprout
if
the
inorganic
be
vitalised
and
take
on
sensibility
and
perform
functions
and
die
if
there
be
passions
and
pains
dreams
and
ambitions
flickerings
of
infinity
and
glimmerings
of
godhead
it
is
for
you
to
be
smitten
with
the
wonder
of
it
and
to
memorialise
it
in
pretty
song
while
for
me
remains
to
classify
it
as
so
much
related
phenomena
so
much
play
and
interplay
of
force
and
matter
in
obedience
to
ascertainable
law
there
are
two
kinds
of
men
the
wonderers
and
the
doers
the
feelers
and
the
thinkers
the
emotionals
and
the
intellectuals
you
take
an
emotional
delight
in
living
i
an
intellectual
delight
you
feel
a
thing
to
be
beautiful
and
joyful
i
seek
to
know
why
it
is
beautiful
and
joyful
you
are
content
that
it
is
no
matter
how
it
came
to
be
i
when
i
have
learned
why
strive
that
we
may
have
more
beautiful
and
joyful
things
the
bloom
the
charm
the
smile
of
life
is
all
too
wonderful
for
you
to
know
to
me
it
is
chiefly
wonderful
because
i
may
know
oh
well
it
is
an
ancient
quarrel
which
neither
you
nor
i
shall
outlive
i
am
rational
you
are
romantic
that
is
all
there
is
to
it
you
are
more
beautiful
i
am
more
useful
and
though
you
will
not
see
it
and
will
never
be
able
to
see
it
you
and
your
beauty
rest
on
me
i
came
into
the
world
before
you
and
i
made
the
way
for
you
i
was
a
hunter
of
beasts
and
a
fighter
of
men
i
discovered
fire
and
covered
my
nakedness
with
the
skins
of
animals
i
builded
cunning
traps
and
wove
branches
and
long
grasses
and
rushes
and
reeds
into
the
thatch
and
i
fashioned
arrows
and
spears
of
bone
and
flint
i
drew
iron
from
the
earth
and
broke
the
first
ground
and
planted
the
first
seed
i
gave
law
and
order
to
the
tribe
and
taught
it
to
fight
with
craft
and
wisdom
i
enabled
the
young
men
to
grow
strong
and
lusty
and
the
women
to
find
favour
with
them
and
i
gave
safety
to
the
women
when
their
progeny
came
forth
and
safety
to
the
progeny
while
it
gathered
strength
and
years
i
did
many
things
out
of
my
blood
and
sweat
and
toil
i
made
it
possible
that
all
men
need
not
all
the
time
hunt
and
fish
and
fight
the
muscle
and
brain
of
every
man
were
no
longer
called
to
satisfy
the
belly
need
and
then
when
of
my
blood
and
sweat
and
toil
i
had
made
room
you
came
high
priest
of
mystery
and
things
unknowable
singer
of
songs
and
seer
of
visions
and
i
did
you
honour
and
gave
you
place
by
feast
and
fire
and
of
the
meat
i
gave
you
the
tenderest
and
of
the
furs
the
softest
need
i
say
that
of
women
you
took
the
fairest
and
you
sang
of
the
souls
of
dead
men
and
of
immortality
of
the
hidden
things
and
of
the
wonder
you
sang
of
voices
whispering
down
the
wind
of
the
secrets
of
light
and
darkness
and
the
ripple
of
running
fountains
you
told
of
the
powers
that
pulsed
the
tides
swept
the
sun
across
the
firmaments
and
held
the
stars
in
their
courses
ay
and
you
scaled
the
sky
and
created
for
me
the
hierarchy
of
heaven
these
things
you
did
dane
but
it
was
i
who
made
you
and
fed
you
and
protected
you
while
you
dreamed
and
sang
i
laboured
sore
and
when
danger
came
and
there
was
a
cry
in
the
night
and
women
and
children
huddling
in
fear
and
strong
men
broken
and
blare
of
trumpets
and
cry
of
battle
at
the
outer
gate
you
fled
to
your
altars
and
called
vainly
on
your
phantoms
of
earth
and
sea
and
sky
and
i
i
girded
my
loins
and
strapped
my
harness
on
and
smote
in
the
fighting
line
and
died
perchance
that
you
and
the
women
and
children
might
live
and
in
times
of
peace
you
throve
and
waxed
fat
but
only
by
our
brain
and
blood
did
we
men
of
the
fighting
line
make
possible
those
times
of
peace
and
when
you
throve
you
looked
about
you
and
saw
the
beauty
of
the
world
and
fancied
yet
greater
beauty
and
because
of
me
your
fancy
became
fact
and
marvels
arose
in
stone
and
bronze
and
costly
wood
and
while
your
brows
were
bright
and
you
visioned
things
of
the
spirit
and
rose
above
time
and
space
to
probe
eternity
i
concerned
myself
with
the
work
of
head
and
hand
i
employed
myself
with
the
mastery
of
matter
i
studied
the
times
and
seasons
and
the
crops
and
made
the
earth
fruitful
i
builded
roads
and
bridges
and
moles
and
won
the
secrets
of
metals
and
virtues
of
the
elements
bit
by
bit
and
with
great
travail
i
have
conquered
and
enslaved
the
blind
forces
i
builded
ships
and
ventured
the
sea
and
beyond
the
baths
of
sunset
found
new
lands
i
conquered
peoples
and
organised
nations
and
knit
empires
and
gave
periods
of
peace
to
vast
territories
and
the
arts
of
peace
flourished
and
you
multiplied
yourself
in
divers
ways
you
were
priest
and
singer
and
dancer
and
musician
you
expressed
your
fancies
in
colours
and
metals
and
marbles
you
wrote
epics
and
lyrics
ay
as
you
write
lyrics
dane
kempton
and
i
multiplied
myself
i
kept
hunger
afar
off
and
fire
and
sword
from
your
habitation
and
the
bondsmen
in
obedience
under
you
i
solved
methods
of
government
and
invented
systems
of
jurisprudence
out
of
my
toil
sprang
forms
and
institutions
you
sang
of
them
and
were
the
slave
of
them
but
i
was
the
maker
of
them
and
the
changer
of
them
you
worshipped
at
the
shrine
of
the
idea
i
sought
the
fact
and
the
law
behind
the
fact
i
was
the
worker
and
maker
and
liberator
you
were
conventional
tradition
bound
you
you
were
full
bellied
and
content
and
you
sang
of
the
things
that
were
you
were
mastered
by
dogma
did
the
mediæval
church
say
the
earth
was
flat
you
sang
of
an
earth
that
was
flat
and
danced
and
made
your
little
shows
on
an
earth
that
was
flat
and
you
helped
to
bind
me
with
chains
and
burn
me
with
fire
when
my
facts
and
the
laws
behind
my
facts
shook
your
dogmas
dante
highest
audacity
could
not
transcend
a
material
inferno
milton
could
not
shake
off
lucifer
and
hell
you
were
more
beautiful
but
not
only
was
i
more
useful
but
i
made
the
way
for
you
that
there
might
be
greater
beauty
you
did
not
reck
of
that
to
you
the
heart
was
the
seat
of
the
emotions
i
formulated
the
circulation
of
the
blood
you
gave
charms
and
indulgences
to
the
world
i
gave
it
medicine
and
surgery
to
you
famine
and
pestilence
were
acts
of
providence
and
punishment
of
sin
i
made
the
world
a
granary
and
drained
its
cities
to
you
the
mass
of
the
people
were
poor
lost
wretches
who
would
be
rewarded
in
paradise
or
baked
in
hell
you
could
offer
them
no
earthly
happiness
of
decency
forsooth
beggars
as
well
as
kings
were
of
divine
right
but
i
shattered
the
royal
prerogatives
and
overturned
the
thrones
of
the
one
and
lifted
the
other
somewhat
out
of
the
dirt
nor
is
my
work
done
with
my
inventions
and
discoveries
and
rational
enterprise
i
draw
the
world
together
and
make
it
kin
the
uplift
is
but
begun
and
in
the
great
world
i
am
making
i
shall
be
as
of
old
to
you
dane
i
who
have
made
you
and
freed
you
shall
give
you
space
and
greater
freedom
and
as
of
old
we
shall
quarrel
as
when
first
you
came
to
me
and
found
me
at
my
rude
you
shall
be
the
scorner
of
matter
and
i
the
master
of
matter
you
may
laugh
at
me
and
my
work
but
you
shall
not
be
absent
from
the
feast
nor
shall
your
voice
be
silent
for
when
i
have
conquered
the
globe
and
enthralled
the
elements
and
harnessed
the
stars
you
shall
sing
the
epic
of
man
and
as
of
old
it
shall
be
of
the
deeds
i
have
done

the
curtain
is
rung
down
on
an
illusion
but
it
rises
again
on
another
this
time
as
before
with
the
look
of
the
absolute
good
and
true
upon
it
it
is
because
we
are
at
once
actor
and
spectator
that
we
find
no
fault
with
blinking
sight
and
slothful
thought
we
are
finite
branded
and
content
except
during
the
shrill
undermining
moments
when
the
orchestra
is
tuning
up
thus
we
struggle
i
follow
your
letter
and
wonder
whether
your
illusions
have
qualities
of
beauty
which
escape
me
i
give
you
the
benefit
of
every
doubt
which
it
is
possible
for
me
to
harbour
with
regard
to
my
own
system
of
illusions
you
glorify
the
crowd
practical
you
attach
yourself
to
the
ranks
that
carried
thought
into
action
you
inspire
yourself
with
rugged
strength
by
dwelling
on
the
achievements
of
ruggedness
forgetting
that
the
progress
of
the
world
is
not
marshalled
by
those
who
work
with
line
and
rule
it
was
not
his
crew
but
columbus
who
discovered
america
the
crew
stood
between
the
old
and
the
new
as
indeed
the
crew
always
does
between
the
idealist
and
his
hope
were
hosts
of
practical
enemies
whom
he
had
to
subdue
before
he
reached
land
but
i
must
not
fall
into
your
mistake
of
dividing
men
into
categories
men
are
not
either
intellectual
or
emotional
they
are
both
it
is
a
rounded
not
an
angular
development
which
we
follow
feeling
and
thinking
are
not
mutually
exclusive
and
the
great
personality
feels
deeply
because
he
thinks
highly
feels
keenly
because
he
sees
widely
common
sense
is
not
incompatible
with
uncommon
sense
evil
does
not
of
necessity
attend
beauty
nor
weakness
the
strength
of
genius
i
shall
sing
of
the
deeds
you
have
done
if
your
deeds
are
worthy
of
song
i
shall
sing
a
song
of
the
sword
too
should
the
sword
thrust
through
the
fatuous
thrust
through
the
fungous
brood
whatever
helps
the
races
to
better
life
sings
itself
into
racial
lore
and
i
alone
shall
not
refuse
the
tribute
when
you
come
to
see
that
the
iliad
is
as
great
a
gift
to
the
race
as
the
doings
of
achilles
that
the
iliads
are
more
significant
than
the
doings
they
celebrate
you
will
cease
to
classify
men
into
doers
and
singers
you
will
cease
to
dishonour
yourself
in
the
eyes
of
the
singers
with
the
hope
that
in
so
doing
you
gain
somewhat

it
interferes
with

you
have
the
advantage
of
him
there
no
doubt
however
you
lose
more
than
you
gain
you
have
shattered
the
dream
and
have
awakened
to
what
what
is
this
reality
in
which
your

is

the

solved
the

pierced
the

and

of

but

not
include

so
the
motif
of
your

grows
all
confused
your

omits

you
sing

his
ordinary

of

a
lyric
love
half
angel
and
half

and
all
a
wonder
and
a
wild
desire
bidwell
exaggerates
perhaps
but
unless
he
feels
this
for
his
wife
he
has
no
wife
barbara
obeyed
the
voice
of
her
heart
that
sounds
sentimental
but
it
is
none
the
less
a
courageous
thing
to
do
i
was
inconsistent
enough
to
be
sorry
because
she
loved
a
crippled
man
bidwell
and
barbara
are
wiser
and
happier
than
you

than
you
from
whose
hand
the

of
parnassus
hill
has
been
filched
is
there
one
state
of
consciousness
better
than
another
i
think
yes
better
to
have
long
youthful
thoughts
and
to
thrill
to
vibrant
emotions
than
to
grovel
sluggishly
better
to
hope
and
dream
and
aspire
and
sway
to
great
harmonies
than
to
be
blind
and
deaf
and
dumb
better
for
the
type
better
for
the
immortality
of
the
world
soul
this
to
me
is
a
vital
thought
therefore
life
or
death
is
in
the
issue
for
the
rest
i
know
not
by
the
glimmer
of
light
lent
me
i
can
but
guess
greatness
and
descry
vagueness
you
go
further
and
would
touch
the
phantasmagorial
veil
right
i
say
and
i
pray
godspeed
but
there
must
be
intensity
are
you
thrilled
do
you
stretch
out
your
arms
and
dream
the
beauty
it
is
only
when
you
gaze
into
a
reality
empty
of
the
voices
of
life
that
i
would
wake
you
to
bid
you
dream
better
well
herbert
i
have
quarrelled
with
you
and
shall
to
the
end
i
promise
i
wish
i
could
take
you
away
hide
you
from
your
sight
and
pour
my
poetic
spleen
out
on
you
oh
i
shall
torment
you
into
reason
and
passion
whatever
you
may
choose
to
be
you
are
my
son
i
must
take
you
and
keep
you
as
you
are
of
course
but
i
choose
to
tell
the
truth
to
you
though
i
do
love
you
and
hold
you
mine
disagreeable
of
me
but
how
else

from

london
sunday
january
behold
i
have
lived
i
press
your
face
to
the
breathing
stinging
roses
of
my
days
and
bid
you
drink
in
the
sweet
and
throb
with
the
pain
what
is
my
philosophy
but
a
translation
of
the
facts
which
have
stamped
me
perhaps
if
i
let
you
read
these
facts
you
will
the
sooner
come
to
share
my
consecration
and
my
faith
i
must
teach
you
to
know
that
you
are
the
fact
of
my
whole
tangled
web
of
facts
and
that
all
that
i
have
and
am
and
all
that
might
have
been
i
and
mine
stretches
itself
out
in
the
unmarked
path
which
is
before
you
i
take
you
back
with
me
to
the
road
white
with
dust
upon
which
like
a
viking
and
like
a
feeble
girl
i
have
travelled
it
is
not
long
but
how
many
paths
what
byways
and
what
turns
what
sudden
glimpses
of
sea
and
sky
what
inaccessibleness
hark
from
the
wood
on
either
side
murmurings
of
hope
and
hard
sobbing
of
despair
young
laughter
of
joy
and
aged
renunciations
see
from
amongst
the
pines
the
farewell
gleam
of
a
white
hand
all
of
it
dear
dearly
bought
and
precious
and
miraculous
the
heartache
even
as
the
gladness
life
is
worth
living
through
every
grain
of
it
from
the
foundations
to
the
last
edge
of
the
cornerstone
death
ay
through
every
grain
of
it
even
that
morning
in
the
wood
thirty
years
ago
when
your
mother
put
her
hand
in
mine
and
looked
a
great
pity
into
my
eyes
indeed
she
loved
me
well
but
romance
shone
on
the
brow
of
john
wace
for
her
his
face
was
sunlit
and
she
needs
must
take
it
between
her
hands
and
hold
it
forever
he
was
her
siegfried
her
master
thus
the
gods
decreed
and
we
three
obeyed
what
else
was
there
to
do
we
must
be
honest
before
all
and
ellen
did
not
love
me
any
more
and
i
must
know
it
and
wipe
out
a
past
of
deepest
mutuality
and
strengthen
and
console
and
restore
the
woman
whose
hand
held
mine
while
her
eyes
were
turned
elsewhere
before
that
bright
black
summer
morning
which
saw
me
i
knew
i
should
have
to
renounce
her
their
souls
rushed
together
in
their
first
meeting
john
had
been
away
knocking
about
museums
and
colleges
and
carrying
on
tempestuous
radical
work
he
was
splendidly
picturesque
i
was
a
youth
of
almost
ten
years
his
junior
a
boy
full
of
aims
and
groping
powers
reaching
toward
what
he
had
firm
in
his
grasp
ellen
talked
of
his
coming
and
she
planned
that
she
should
meet
this
my
one
friend
in
the
environment
she
loved
best
in
my
rooms
whose
atmosphere
she
declared
belonged
to
an
earlier
time
and
place
she
found
in
me
nolly
goldsmith
and
all
of
grub
street
so
they
met
at
the
in
my
study
and
a
great
warmth
stole
over
your
father
he
spoke
without
looking
at
either
of
us
while
ellen
looked
as
if
her
destiny
had
just
begun
without
it
rained
i
strode
to
the
window
and
in
a
dazed
way
stared
at
the
which
was
sticking
out
its
flaming
little
tongue
to
the
night
why
was
i
mocked
there
was
no
mocking
and
there
should
have
been
no
bitterness
of
that
there
was
none
either
after
a
while
ellen
put
her
hand
on
my
hair
and
a
strong
primal
emotion
rose
in
me
in
that
moment
civilisation
was
as
if
it
had
not
been
i
reverted
to
the
primitive
the
blood
of
forgotten
ancestors
and
reasoned
me
my
ethics
i
turned
to
her
met
her
flushed
cheeks
and
moved
being
and
the
glory
of
dawning
in
her
eyes
i
measured
my
strength
with
hers
and
your
father
herbert
easily
great
strength
was
mine
in
my
passion
easily
i
could
carry
her
off
you
too
have
had
moments
of
upheaval
when
you
heard
the
growling
of
the
tiger
and
the
bear
when
the
brute
crowded
out
the
man
then
your
soul
writhed
in
derision
you
scoffed
at
that
which
you
had
held
to
be
the
nobility
of
the
soul
and
you
minced
words
satirically
over
the
exquisiteness
of
the
type
which
we
have
evolved
then
the
experiment
of
life
turned
farce
the
heavens
fell
about
your
ears
and
fool
was
upon
your
lips
oh
the
hurricane
that
sweeps
over
the
soul
when
it
is
cheated
of
its
joy
in
the
first
instant
of
ellen
indifference
when
i
felt
myself
pushed
out
of
her
life
i
forgot
everything
but
my
desire
i
could
not
renounce
her
i
was
in
the
throes
of
the
passion
for
ownership
gentle
girl
between
whom
and
myself
there
had
been
naught
but
sweetness
and
fellowship
how
often
had
we
talked
large
we
were
very
young
of
our
sublimities
and
potentialities
how
often
had
we
pictured
tragedies
of
surrender
and
greatened
in
the
speaking
ah
it
should
come
true
for
her
and
for
me
there
must
be
miracles
and
there
were
so
was
the
strength
of
the
spirit
proven
so
was
it
shown
to
be
pure
waft
of
the
will
so
was
i
confirmed
in
the
creed
which
believes
that
to
keep
we
must
lose
and
to
live
we
must
die
so
was
i
assured
that
there
may
be
but
one
way
and
that
the
way
of
service
i
did
not
grip
her
passionately
in
my
arms
i
withdrew
i
did
much
to
make
her
task
of
leaving
me
an
easy
one
were
it
not
for
my
efforts
it
would
have
been
harder
for
her
to
obey
a
mandate
which
made
for
my
pain
she
could
not
quite
drown
an
old
puritan
voice
speaking
with
the
authority
of
tradition
which
bade
her
hold
to
her
vows
yes
i
made
it
easy
for
her
harrow
my
soul
with
theories
of
selection
and
survival
if
you
dare
in
those
days
the
spires
of
the
temple
were
golden
the
shrine
white
the
door
was
seen
from
every
point
in
the
world
we
who
worshipped
knew
not
of
doubt
stirred
by
the
rumbling
organ
tones
of
causes
and
ideas
we
immolated
our
lives
gladly
high
priests
of
thought
we
swung
the
censers
and
rose
on
the
breast
of
the
incense
ellen
and
john
and
myself
glorified
god
and
enjoyed
him
forever
god
the
type
the
final
humanity
the
giant
body
soul
of
man
in
our
hearts
dwelt
a
religion
which
compelled
us
to
serve
the
ideal
we
strove
to
become
what
organically
we
felt
the
human
with
his
drippings
of
warm
tears
may
become
we
were
the
of
the
advancing
margin
of
the
world
we
were
the
mark
toward
which
all
the
tides
forever
make
we
were
soldiers
and
priests
and
so
when
ellen
loved
and
lacked
courage
for
her
love
i
helped
her
a
past
of
kindness
and
ardour
riveted
her
to
my
side
she
knew
that
we
were
in
feeling
and
fact
divorced
from
each
other
by
virtue
of
her
stronger
love
for
john
yet
did
she
do
battle
with
the
rich
young
love
for
two
years
we
had
been
close
she
had
been
so
much
my
friend
she
could
not
in
maiden
charity
seal
for
me
a
so
unwelcome
fate
i
had
awakened
her
slumbering
soul
with
my
first
look
into
the
sphinx
wonder
of
her
eyes
for
me
she
had
become
fire
and
dew
flame
of
the
sun
and
flower
of
the
hill
without
me
to
help
her
do
it
she
could
not
leave
me
to
the
master
of
matter
this
coping
with
spiritual
abstractions
must
appear
like
juggling
with
intellectual
phantasmagoria
yet
i
protest
that
life
is
finally
for
intangible
triumphs
unnamed
fragrances
steal
upon
the
senses
and
the
soul
revels
and
greatens
unseen
hands
draw
us
to
worlds
afar
and
we
are
gathered
up
in
the
dignity
of
the
human
spirit
unknown
ideas
attract
and
hold
us
and
we
take
our
place
in
the
universe
as
intellectual
factors
in
giving
up
ellen
i
helped
her
and
sacredly
better
still
i
sent
on
into
a
world
of
vague
thinking
and
weak
acting
the
impulse
of
devotion
to
revealed
truth
she
had
a
sweet
way
of
sitting
low
and
resting
her
head
on
my
knee
she
sat
through
one
whole
day
with
me
thus
and
for
hours
i
could
have
thought
her
asleep
were
it
not
for
the
waves
of
feeling
which
surged
in
her
upturned
face
toward
the
end
she
raised
her
head
ecstasy
in
her
eyes
and
on
her
cheek
and
lip
dane
i
love
you
dane
dane
the
whole
of
me
was
caught
up
in
the
accents
of
that
tremulousness
she
had
know
john
three
months
but
her
love
for
him
was
young
it
had
come
unexpectedly
it
was
still
unexpressed
and
ineffable
her
yearning
for
him
led
to
softness
toward
me
and
though
she
rose
out
of
her
mood
as
one
does
from
a
dream
the
hours
when
we
were
like
the
angels
all
love
and
all
speech
were
mine
so
much
was
vouchsafed
me
memories
and
echoes
gusts
of
sweet
breath
from
the
violets
on
your
mother
grave
the
prophet
of
matter
will
have
none
of
them
and
i
fear
will
pity
me
that
i
am
so
much
theirs
i
am
yours
also
dear
lad
and
i
wish
to
serve
you
dane
kempton
xi
from
herbert
wace
to
dane
kempton
the
ridge
berkeley
california
january
i
do
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
weep
i
have
just
finished
reading
your
letter
and
i
can
hardly
think
words
seem
to
have
lost
their
meaning
and
words
used
as
you
use
them
are
without
significance
you
appear
to
speak
a
tongue
strangely
familiar
yet
one
i
can
not
understand
you
are
unintelligible
as
i
dare
say
i
am
to
you
and
small
wonder
that
we
are
unintelligible
our
difference
presents
itself
quite
clearly
to
the
scientific
mind
and
somewhat
in
this
fashion
man
acquires
knowledge
of
the
outer
world
through
his
sensations
and
perceptions
sensation
ends
in
sentiment
and
perception
ends
in
reason
these
are
the
two
sides
of
man
nature
and
the
individual
is
determined
and
ruled
by
whichever
side
in
him
happens
to
be
temperamentally
dominant
i
have
already
classed
you
as
a
feeler
myself
as
a
thinker
this
is
i
true
you
i
am
confident
it
to
be
true
i
reason
why
it
is
true
you
accept
it
on
faith
as
true
lose
sight
of
the
argument
forthwith
and
proceed
to
express
it
in
emotional
terms
which
is
to
say
that
you
take
it
to
heart
and
feel
badly
because
it
happens
to
be
so
you
feign
to
know
this
modern
scientific
slang
and
you
are
contemptuous
of
it
because
you
do
not
know
it
the
terms
i
use
freight
no
ideas
to
you
they
are
sounds
rhythmic
and
musical
but
they
are
not
definite
symbols
of
thought
their
facts
you
do
not
grasp
for
instance
the
prehensile
organs
of
insects
the
great
toothed
mandibles
of
the
black
the
amorous
din
of
the
male
cicada
and
the
muteness
of
his
mate
these
are
facts
which
you
can
not
relate
one
with
the
other
nor
can
you
generalise
upon
them
let
me
add
to
these
related
characters
and
you
can
not
discern
the
law
which
is
alike
to
all
what
to
you
the
fluttering
moth
decked
in
gold
and
crimson
brilliant
iridescent
splendid
the
beauty
of
it
bids
you
bend
to
deity
otherwise
it
has
no
worth
it
is
a
stimulus
to
religion
and
that
is
all
so
with
the
glowing
incandescence
of
the
stickleback
and
its
polished
scales
of
silver
what
make
you
of
the
hoarse
voice
of
the
gorilla
is
not
the
dewlap
of
the
ox
inscrutable
the
mane
of
the
lion
the
tusks
of
the
boar
the
of
the
deer
in
the
amethyst
and
sapphire
of
the
peacock
wing
you
find
no
rationality
to
you
it
is
a
manifestation
of
the
wonder
which
is
taboo
and
so
with
the
cock
bird
displaying
his
feathered
ruffs
and
furbelows
dancing
strange
antics
and
spilling
out
his
heart
in
song
i
on
the
other
hand
dare
to
gather
all
these
phenomena
together
and
find
out
the
common
truth
the
common
fact
the
common
law
which
is
generalisation
which
is
science
i
learn
that
there
are
two
functions
which
all
life
must
perform
nutrition
and
reproduction
and
i
learn
that
in
all
life
the
performance
according
to
time
and
space
and
degree
is
very
like
the
slug
must
take
to
itself
food
else
it
will
perish
and
so
i
the
slug
must
procreate
its
kind
or
its
kind
will
perish
and
so
i
the
need
being
the
same
the
only
difference
is
in
the
expression
in
all
life
come
times
and
seasons
when
the
individuals
are
aware
of
dim
yearnings
and
blind
compulsions
and
masterful
desires
the
senses
are
quickened
and
alert
to
the
call
of
kind
and
just
as
the
fish
and
the
reptile
glimmeringly
adumbrate
man
so
do
these
yearnings
and
desires
adumbrate
what
man
in
himself
calls
love
spelled
all
out
in
capitals
i
repeat
the
need
is
the
same
from
the
amoeba
up
the
ladder
of
life
to
you
and
me
comes
this
passion
of
perpetuation
and
in
yourself
refine
and
sublimate
as
you
will
it
is
none
the
less
blind
unreasoning
and
compelling
and
now
we
come
to
the
point
in
the
development
of
life
from
low
to
high
there
came
a
dividing
of
the
ways
instinct
as
a
factor
of
development
had
its
limitations
it
culminated
in
that
remarkable
mechanism
the
it
could
go
no
farther
in
that
direction
life
was
thwarted
but
life
splendid
and
invincible
not
to
be
thwarted
changed
the
direction
of
its
advance
and
reason
became
the
developmental
factor
reason
dawned
far
down
in
the
scale
of
life
but
it
culminates
in
man
and
the
end
is
not
yet
the
lever
in
his
arm
he
duplicates
in
wood
and
steel
the
lenses
in
his
eyes
in
glass
the
visual
impressions
of
his
brain
on
chemically
sensitised
he
is
able
reasoning
from
events
and
knowing
the
law
to
control
the
blind
forces
and
direct
their
operation
having
ascertained
the
laws
of
development
he
is
able
to
take
hold
of
life
and
mould
and
knead
it
into
more
beautiful
and
useful
forms
domestic
selection
it
is
called
does
he
wish
horses
which
are
fast
he
selects
the
fastest
he
studies
the
physics
of
velocity
in
relation
to
equine
locomotion
and
with
an
eye
to
withers
loins
hocks
and
haunches
he
segregates
his
brood
mares
and
his
stallions
and
behold
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
he
has
a
thoroughbred
stock
swifter
of
foot
than
any
ever
in
the
world
before
since
he
takes
sexual
selection
into
his
own
hands
and
scientifically
breeds
the
fish
and
the
fowl
the
beast
and
the
vegetable
why
may
he
not
scientifically
breed
his
own
kind
the
fish
and
the
fowl
and
the
beast
and
the
vegetable
obey
dim
yearnings
and
vague
desires
and
reproduce
themselves
poor
the
reproduction
says
man
to
mother
nature
allow
me
and
mother
nature
is
thrust
aside
and
exceeded
by
this
new
creator
this
these
yearnings
and
desires
of
the
beast
and
the
vegetable
are
the
best
tools
nature
has
succeeded
in
devising
having
devised
them
she
leaves
their
operation
to
the
blindness
of
chance
steps
in
man
and
controls
and
directs
them
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
life
conscious
intelligence
forms
and
transforms
life
these
yearnings
and
desires
promptings
of
the
abysmal
fecundity
have
in
man
evolved
into
what
is
called
love
they
arise
in
instinct
and
sensation
and
culminate
in
sentiment
and
emotion
they
master
man
and
the
intellect
of
man
as
they
master
the
beast
and
all
the
acts
of
the
beast
and
they
operate
in
the
development
of
man
with
the
same
blindness
of
chance
that
they
operate
in
the
development
of
the
beast
now
this
is
the
law
as
a
means
for
the
perpetuation
and
development
of
the
human
type
is
very
crude
and
open
to
improvement
what
the
intellect
of
man
has
done
with
the
beast
the
intellect
of
man
may
do
with
it
is
a
truism
to
say
that
my
intellect
is
wiser
than
my
emotions
so
knowing
the
precise
value
and
use
of
this
erotic
phenomenon
this
sexual
madness
this
love
i
for
one
elect
to
choose
my
mate
with
my
intellect
thus
i
choose
hester
and
i
do
truly
love
her
but
in
the
intellectual
sense
and
not
the
sense
you
fanatically
demand
i
am
not
seized
with
a
loutish
vertigo
when
i
look
upon
her
and
touch
her
hand
nor
do
i
feel
impelled
to
leave
her
presence
if
i
would
live
as
did
dante
the
presence
of
beatrice
nor
the
painful
confusion
of
rousseau
when
in
the
same
room
with
madame
goton
he
seemed
impelled
to
leap
into
the
flaming
fireplace
but
i
do
feel
for
hester
what
happily
mated
men
and
women
after
they
have
lived
down
the
passion
feel
in
the
afternoon
of
life
it
is
the
affection
of
man
for
woman
which
is
sanity
it
is
the
sanity
of
intercourse
which
replaces
love
madness
the
sanity
which
comes
upon
sparrows
after
the
ardour
of
mating
when
they
leave
off
wrangling
and
chattering
and
set
soberly
to
work
to
build
their
nest
for
the
coming
brood
love
is
the
madness
of
and
affection
is
the
sanity
of
complete
understanding
it
is
based
upon
reason
and
service
and
healthy
sacrifice
the
first
is
a
blind
mating
of
the
blind
the
second
a
clear
and
union
of
male
and
female
who
find
enough
in
common
to
warrant
that
union
in
a
word
and
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
it
is
sex
comradeship
love
can
not
survive
marriage
any
considerable
time
it
is
doomed
inexorably
to
flicker
out
and
when
it
has
flickered
out
it
must
be
replaced
by
affection
or
else
the
parties
to
it
must
separate
we
well
know
that
many
men
and
women
unable
to
build
up
affection
on
the
ruins
of
love
do
separate
or
if
they
do
not
continue
to
live
together
in
cold
tolerance
or
bitter
hatred
now
hester
is
my
mate
we
have
much
in
common
there
is
intellectual
spiritual
and
physical
affinity
the
caress
of
her
voice
and
the
feel
of
her
mind
are
pleasurable
to
me
likewise
the
touch
of
her
hand
and
you
know
that
in
the
union
of
man
and
woman
the
higher
affinities
are
not
possible
unless
there
first
be
physiological
affinity
we
shall
go
through
life
as
comrades
go
hand
in
hand
hester
and
i
and
great
happiness
will
be
ours
and
because
of
all
this
i
say
you
have
no
right
to
challenge
my
happiness
and
vex
my
days
and
feel
for
me
as
one
dead
my
dear
bewildered
dane
come
down
out
of
the
clouds
if
i
am
wrong
i
have
gone
over
the
ground
then
do
you
go
over
that
ground
with
me
and
show
where
i
am
wrong
but
do
not
pour
out
on
me
your
romantic
and
poetic
spleen
confine
yourself
to
the
fact
man
to
the
irrefragable
fact
herbert
ah
your
later
letter
has
just
arrived
i
can
only
say
that
i
understand
but
withal
i
am
pained
that
i
am
not
nearer
to
you
these
intellectual
phantasmagoria
rise
up
like
huge
amorphous
ghosts
and
hold
me
from
you
i
can
not
get
through
the
mists
and
glooms
to
press
your
hand
and
tell
you
how
dear
i
hold
you
do
dane
do
let
us
cease
from
this
let
us
discuss
no
further
let
me
care
for
hester
in
my
own
way
so
long
as
i
do
no
sin
and
harm
no
one
and
be
you
father
to
us
and
bless
us
who
else
must
go
unblessed
for
hester
also
is
fatherless
and
motherless
and
you
must
be
to
her
as
you
are
to
me
herbert
xii
from
dane
kempton
to
herbert
wace
london
queen
road
chelsea
february
so
we
have
got
into
an
argument
i
have
been
poring
over
your
last
two
or
three
letters
and
they
read
like
a
set
of
briefs
for
a
debate
doubtless
mine
have
the
same
forensic
quality
our
letters
have
become
rebuttals
pure
and
simple
this
discovery
gave
my
pen
pause
for
a
week
it
occurred
to
me
that
walt
whitman
must
have
meant
didactic
letters
too
when
he
said
of
the
fretters
of
our
little
world
they
make
me
sick
talking
of
their
duty
to
god
yet
friend
should
speak
to
friend
should
utter
the
word
than
which
nothing
is
more
sacred
let
there
be
light
and
there
was
light
a
ripple
of
light
and
a
flash
then
the
darkness
broke
and
dispersed
from
the
face
of
the
waters
it
was
a
of
words
bringing
drama
into
a
nebulous
creation
let
the
word
break
up
our
night
and
let
us
not
only
grant
but
avow
the
conviction
it
brings
us
no
matter
what
the
consequence
let
us
worship
the
irrefragable
fact
you
hold
that
marriage
is
an
institution
having
for
its
purpose
the
perpetuation
of
the
species
and
that
respect
and
affection
are
sufficient
to
bring
two
people
into
this
most
intimate
possible
relation
you
also
hold
that
the
business
of
the
world
pressing
hard
upon
men
makes
love
from
their
lives
a
thing
apart
and
that
this
is
as
it
should
be
your
letters
are
an
exposition
and
a
defence
of
what
i
may
loosely
call
the
practical
theory
you
show
that
the
world
is
for
work
and
workers
and
that
life
is
for
results
as
seen
in
institutions
and
visible
achievements
i
on
the
other
hand
maintain
that
it
takes
a
greater
dowry
to
marry
upon
than
affection
and
that
men
love
as
intensely
and
with
as
much
abandon
as
women
people
love
in
proportion
to
the
depth
of
their
natures
and
the
finest
man
in
the
world
has
an
infinite
capacity
for
giving
and
receiving
love
store
the
spell
is
strongest
upon
the
finest
this
briefly
is
what
we
have
been
saying
to
each
other
you
attack
my
idealism
call
me
dreamer
and
accuse
me
of
being
out
of
joint
with
the
time
which
itself
is
rigorously
in
joint
with
the
laws
of
growth
and
i
class
you
with
the
philistine
because
of
your
exaggeration
of
practical
values
i
hold
that
it
is
gross
to
respect
the
fact
tangible
at
the
expense
of
the
feeling
ineffable
in
your
last
letter
you
exploit
the
theory
of
nutrition
and
reproduction
with
a
charm
and
warmth
which
helps
me
see
you
as
i
have
so
long
known
you
and
which
tells
me
again
that
you
are
worth
fighting
for
and
saving
but
to
trace
love
to
its
biologic
beginning
is
not
to
deny
its
existence
love
has
a
history
as
significant
as
that
of
life
when
eons
ago
the
primitive
man
looked
at
his
neighbour
and
recognised
him
as
a
fellow
to
himself
consciousness
of
kind
awoke
and
a
cell
was
exploded
which
functioned
love
when
through
the
ages
economic
forces
taught
men
the
need
of
mutual
aid
when
everywhere
in
life
the
law
of
development
charged
men
with
leanings
and
desires
and
outreachings
then
the
sway
of
love
began
in
life
what
was
subconscious
became
conscious
what
back
in
the
past
was
a
mere
adumbration
gloried
out
in
aurora
splendours
the
love
of
a
juliet
is
the
outgrowth
of
natural
processes
manifesting
themselves
everywhere
down
the
scale
but
it
is
also
the
gift
of
the
last
evolution
and
it
speaks
to
us
from
the
topmost
notch
in
the
scale
the
charm
of
morning
rests
on
a
juliet
love
because
its
hour
is
young
and
yet
old
striking
the
time
of
the
past
and
the
future
it
is
thus
that
the
hunger
of
the
race
and
the
passion
of
the
race
become
in
the
individual
the
need
for
happiness
the
need
of
the
race
and
the
need
of
the
individual
are
at
once
the
same
and
different
what
was
the
point
of
your
letter
that
sexual
selection
obtains
i
grant
it
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
us
as
intelligent
men
and
women
to
call
to
the
aid
of
instinct
our
social
wisdom
i
grant
and
avow
it
but
our
social
wisdom
insists
that
we
obey
the
choices
of
instinct
our
social
wisdom
is
only
another
phase
of
our
refinement
which
in
impelling
us
to
a
love
of
the
beautiful
does
not
the
less
impel
us
to
love
our
social
wisdom
educates
our
taste
without
lessening
our
taste
for
the
thing
love
a
beautiful
person
nobly
but
be
sure
you
love
her
says
our
social
wisdom
with
interesting
tautology
besides
you
are
a
heretic
to
your
own
breed
herbert
it
is
you
who
would
forsake
our
present
social
wisdom
ruling
modern
men
by
laws
which
obtained
in
primitive
life
it
is
you
who
steadily
hark
back
to
the
past
and
to
states
of
consciousness
which
were
but
can
never
be
again
the
early
facts
of
biology
can
not
include
that
which
transcends
them
to
borrow
from
ernest
seton
thompson
man
is
evolved
with
the
lower
orders
in
the
same
way
that
water
is
changed
into
steam
and
the
nature
of
the
change
when
it
is
effected
is
as
radical
add
a
number
of
degrees
of
heat
to
water
and
it
is
still
water
let
one
degree
be
wanting
to
the
necessary
number
and
the
substance
is
still
intact
add
the
last
degree
and
water
is
no
longer
water
from
water
to
steam
is
a
radical
change
and
a
transformation
you
agree
to
improve
upon
the
beasts
of
the
fields
and
upon
our
own
race
in
the
past
and
in
this
you
go
farther
than
you
have
need
if
marriage
is
for
nothing
else
than
to
serve
the
instinct
for
perpetuation
you
shew
some
respect
for
what
is
natural
and
instinctive
yet
you
say
that
all
would
be
as
well
if
individual
choice
had
not
prevailed
and
men
and
women
were
shuffled
about
you
draw
up
a
cold
programme
for
action
in
affairs
of
the
spirit
and
formulate
a
code
of
procedure
in
matters
of
the
heart
i
have
a
programme
too
mine
does
not
break
with
nature
on
the
contrary
it
obeys
every
instinct
and
listens
to
every
call
on
the
senses
my
love
begins
in
my
biologic
self
grows
with
my
growth
takes
its
hues
from
visioned
sunsets
in
skies
its
grace
from
swaying
rivers
of
grain
seen
in
dreams
it
is
for
me
what
it
is
for
fish
and
fowl
beast
and
vegetable
it
is
my
passion
for
perpetuation
but
it
is
also
something
as
different
from
this
as
i
am
different
from
beast
and
vegetable
my
love
is
blind
unreasoning
and
compelling
and
for
that
i
trust
it
i
do
not
conceive
myself
therefore
i
do
not
say
to
nature
allow
me
i
can
not
be
sure
that
when
i
say
it
in
the
case
of
the
horse
who
obeys
like
me
dim
yearning
and
vague
desires
i
do
not
sacrifice
him
to
a
lust
of
my
own
the
lust
for
owning
and
spoiling
is
hard
to
cope
with
perhaps
a
purer
time
is
near
when
upborne
by
a
sense
of
the
dignity
of
romance
and
the
sacredness
of
life
man
will
refrain
from
laying
rough
hands
on
his
mute
brothers
the
romance
which
is
my
proof
of
the
good
of
being
does
not
rest
on
passion
the
unclean
fires
that
consume
the
loutish
and
degenerate
are
not
of
love
you
quote
instances
of
the
hyperphysical
and
hysterical
the
feeling
that
i
would
have
you
obey
for
your
soul
sake
and
without
which
you
are
but
half
alive
is
not
the
blind
passion
of
an
oversexed
sentimentalism
rousseau
was
never
in
love
in
his
life
though
to
say
it
were
to
accuse
him
of
perjury
one
word
more
do
you
wish
to
know
why
i
care
i
care
because
i
know
you
to
be
of
those
who
are
capable
of
love
probably
it
was
one
little
twist
in
your
development
that
has
turned
you
into
alien
ways
of
thinking
and
living
yes
and
more
than
for
this
i
care
because
you
are
the
fulfilment
of
a
sacred
past
you
are
the
son
of
my
sacrifice
and
your
mother
love
i
care
very
much
indeed
i
do
not
wish
you
to
awake
some
terrible
night
to
find
that
you
had
ended
your
romance
before
you
had
begun
it
i
vex
your
days
and
call
you
dead
it
is
because
i
know
the
life
that
is
by
the
grace
of
god
yours
and
because
i
can
not
bear
to
let
you
coffin
it
herbert
there
is
misery
when
the
blood
pales
and
the
tears
dry
up
and
the
flame
of
the
heart
sinks
and
all
that
is
left
is
a
memory
of
a
thought
a
memory
of
very
long
ago
when
one
was
young
and
might
have
chosen
to
live
i
am
sorry
we
darken
the
days
for
each
other

february
barbara
and
earl
celebrated
their
anniversary
yesterday
invitations
were
sent
out
the
guests
consisting
of
melville
and
myself
anniversary
of
what
we
asked
for
answer
we
received
inscrutable
smiles
birthdays
are
accidents
of
fate
you
may
regret
the
accident
or
you
may
be
thick
enough
in
illusion
to
rejoice
over
it
but
you
can
not
in
decency
celebrate
an
occurrence
wholly
independent
of
personal
control
and
yet
concerning
itself
with
you
leave
the
merrymaking
for
appreciative
friends
so
rules
barbara
not
a
birthday
then
nor
the
date
of
their
marriage
the
occasion
was
in
some
flash
struck
from
being
the
memory
of
which
enriches
them
in
a
mood
that
for
an
hour
held
them
in
strong
grasp
in
the
utterance
of
a
word
charged
with
destiny
in
the
avowal
of
their
love
if
their
love
awaited
avowal
whatever
the
cause
they
honoured
it
with
a
will
barbara
eyes
flashed
her
cheeks
were
sweetly
suffused
and
her
voice
was
vibrant
earl
too
was
at
his
best
my
heart
loved
this
man
who
had
lain
all
his
life
with
death
his
health
is
at
its
bad
worst
this
winter
which
fact
made
of
the
celebration
a
rather
affair
he
has
been
obliged
to
abandon
the
but
we
hope
he
can
stay
with
the
school
meanwhile
his
chronic
invalidism
of
body
and
purse
does
not
too
much
affect
him
he
keeps
his
charm
of
tenderness
and
strength
he
rivets
his
pupils
to
him
almost
as
he
riveted
his
barbara
i
have
discovered
my
proof
of
this
couple
happiness
it
is
that
i
have
always
taken
it
for
granted
simple
is
it
not
and
absolute
often
in
their
presence
i
catch
myself
imagining
their
mutual
lives
and
seeing
vaguely
the
graces
that
each
brings
to
each
how
she
must
delight
him
i
say
how
his
eyes
speak
to
her
they
can
never
come
to
the
end
of
each
other
and
so
on
the
ordinary
married
couple
so
often
brings
a
sense
of
distressed
surprise
how
can
these
two
foot
it
together
how
did
it
happen
how
can
it
go
on
last
night
counted
to
me
your
father
and
i
have
had
such
evenings
but
i
did
not
think
i
could
do
it
all
over
again
we
spoke
with
the
fire
and
conceit
of
young
students
exciting
ourselves
with
expired
theories
hoping
old
hopes
smarting
under
blows
that
perhaps
had
long
ceased
to
fall
what
then
what
if
we
were
in
the
facts
we
could
not
have
been
wrong
in
the
feeling
for
the
old
hope
that
has
been
proven
vain
a
new
for
the
ancient
hurt
a
modern
wrong
as
great
and
as
crying
it
was
good
to
feel
that
we
had
not
grown
too
wise
to
harbour
thoughts
of
change
and
redress
or
too
much
ironed
out
with
doctrine
to
be
resigned
i
confess
it
is
long
since
i
have
eaten
my
heart
in
fury
in
impatience
in
wildness
but
last
night
we
awoke
the
radical
in
one
another
we
condemned
the
system
we
placed
ourselves
outside
the
régime
refusing
aught
at
its
hands
registering
our
protest
hating
the
inordinate
scheme
of
things
only
as
hotly
as
we
loved
the
juster
hand
of
a
future
time
it
is
curious
that
we
offsprings
of
parvenue
success
should
be
capable
of
such
repudiation
barbara
accepts
the
management
without
the
trouble
of
a
question
what
do
you
know
what
do
you
know
the
girl
demands
a
radiant
little
angel
in
white
and
a
conservative
you
must
know
yourselves
in
the
wrong
else
would
you
smite
your
way
through
the
world
ah
barbara
has
yet
to
learn
that
it
is
hard
to
live
it
is
not
so
hard
to
fight
and
it
is
easy
to
rest
neutral
but
to
be
fighter
and
bearer
both
to
stand
staunch
holding
ever
to
the
issue
and
yet
without
tameness
to
take
rebuff
and
wait
there
the
true
course
and
the
heroic
it
is
difficult
when
one
has
been
conquered
to
know
it
it
is
difficult
to
honour
an
outgrown
ideal
which
cost
us
nevertheless
comfort
and
prestige
prizes
which
youth
scorns
and
which
oncoming
age
pathetically
enough
holds
dear
it
is
difficult
to
pull
up
when
driving
too
fast
and
too
far
when
galloping
towards
fanaticism
and
it
is
impossible
to
whip
oneself
into
passion
and
martyrdom
it
is
difficult
to
live
little
barbara
for
me
it
is
also
difficult
to
report
a
social
function
at
this
one
browning
presided
for
melville
took
up
caponsacchi
and
read
it
to
us
that
voice
of
his
is
in
itself
an
interpretation
but
browning
needs
interpreting
less
than
any
other
man
who
wrote
great
poems
because
he
wrote
the
greatest
it
was
four
in
the
morning
when
the
o
great
just
good
god
miserable
me
of
the
fell
upon
our
ears
how
we
had
listened
earl
steadily
paced
the
floor
barbara
leaned
her
cheek
upon
my
hand
her
soul
was
doing
battle
and
so
was
mine
we
were
all
fighting
the
gallant
fight
read
pompilia
and
you
are
filled
with
reverence
read
caponsacchi
and
you
are
caught
up
by
the
spirit
of
action
you
must
rise
and
forth
to
burn
your
way
like
he
though
you
may
have
been
too
weary
in
spirit
before
to
answer
to
your
name
when
opportunity
called
roll
it
was
earl
who
broke
the
silence
caused
by
the
inner
tumult
in
a
dreamy
voice
his
eyes
very
eager
and
intent
he
told
us
how
at
one
time
he
had
gone
up
a
hill
that
faced
the
house
in
which
he
lived
a
hard
rain
was
driving
he
fell
at
every
step
up
the
slippery
steepness
but
at
every
step
the
beauty
of
it
became
more
and
more
wondrous
hardly
bearable
the
little
village
sank
lower
and
lower
and
about
him
were
soft
hills
graceful
and
verdant
a
stretch
of
water
lying
dark
under
the
clouded
sky
and
the
mountain
gray
and
watchful
in
the
distance
it
was
then
in
the
chill
of
a
january
rain
on
an
hill
of
a
western
spot
that
he
recognised
the
dear
features
of
the
mother
knew
her
his
as
hers
he
was
and
loved
her
with
passion
the
sea
is
vast
and
wondrous
but
it
is
alien
it
holds
you
apart
it
is
not
of
you
but
the
gentle
earth
with
her
undulating
form
and
the
growing
life
in
her
lap
soothes
with
wordless
harmonies
it
was
then
that
he
forgave
the
fate
which
deformed
him
a
twisted
oak
that
is
all
no
less
a
tree
and
no
less
beautiful
in
the
landscape
and
it
was
sufficient
to
live
in
the
bosom
of
so
much
beauty
sufficient
also
to
die
as
he
stood
thinking
it
out
feeling
the
wonder
and
the
glory
at
times
sorry
for
those
who
can
see
no
longer
the
slanting
sheets
of
rain
and
the
grass
at
the
feet
at
times
feeling
that
since
this
is
good
in
some
impalpable
way
oblivion
to
all
this
may
be
also
good
as
he
stood
there
flushed
with
the
climbing
and
sad
with
great
joy
the
thought
came
with
whom
it
can
not
be
lived
alone
with
whom
he
turned
at
the
touch
of
an
arm
at
his
shoulder
to
meet
the

love
is
a
something
that
begins
in
sensation
and
ends
in
sentiment
thanks
to
beautiful
and
permissible
hyperbole
you
have
begun
with
sensation
in
your
description
of
love
and
have
ended
with
sentiment
you
have
told
me
about
love
in
terms
of
love
which
is
a
vain
performance
and
unscientific
now
let
me
make
you
a
definition
is
a
disorder
of
mind
and
body
and
is
produced
by
passion
under
the
stimulus
of
love
is
a
phase
of
the
operation
of
the
function
of
reproduction
and
it
occurs
solely
in
man
love
adhering
to
the
common
understanding
of
the
term
is
an
emotional
excitement
which
does
not
obtain
among
the
lower
animals
the
lower
animals
lack
the
stimulus
of
imagination
and
with
them
the
passion
for
perpetuation
remains
a
mere
passion
but
man
has
developed
imagination
the
pure
sexual
passion
is
glossed
over
and
obscured
by
a
cloud
of
fancies
mistaken
yearnings
and
distorted
dreams
and
so
well
is
the
real
intent
of
the
function
obscured
that
it
is
actually
lost
to
him
especially
during
the
period
of
love
madness
so
that
there
seems
an
apparent
divorce
between
the
parts
which
go
to
make
up
love
between
passion
and
imagination
the
romantic
lover
of
expressing
sensation
in
terms
of
sentiment
and
fondly
imagining
that
he
is
reasoning
can
not
reconcile
his
with
bodily
grossness
can
not
conceive
that
soul
can
turn
body
and
in
the
embrace
of
body
tell
out
all
the
wonder
of
soul
to
all
sensitive
and
spiritual
men
and
women
come
times
of
anguish
and
tears
and
when
they
are
confounded
and
by
the
physical
aspect
of
love
poor
men
and
women
they
suffer
keenly
and
sincerely
through
lack
of
something
more
than
a
sentimental
concept
of
love
to
them
body
and
soul
appear
things
apart
to
be
kept
apart
lest
the
one
contaminate
the
other
and
in
the
end
loving
well
and
truly
they
prove
their
love
by
enduring
though
unable
ever
quite
to
shake
off
the
sense
of
sin
and
shame
and
personal
degradation
they
do
not
understand
life
that
is
the
trouble
the
beast
lacking
imagination
needs
no
rational
rightness
for
the
various
acts
of
living
such
as
they
need
and
which
they
do
not
possess
because
of
their
unchecked
and
unbalanced
imagination
they
mistake
the
half
of
life
for
the
whole
and
when
forced
to
face
the
whole
are
affrighted
and
shocked
they
do
not
reason
that
the
need
for
perpetuation
is
the
cause
of
passion
and
that
human
passion
working
through
imagination
and
worked
upon
by
imagination
becomes
love
and
while
i
am
in
this
vein
i
may
as
well
deny
that
a
greater
spiritual
dowry
than
affection
is
required
for
marriage
for
that
matter
i
fail
to
see
anything
so
spiritual
in
erotic
phenomena
if
a
man
may
achieve
affection
for
a
woman
without
undergoing
madness
if
a
man
may
take
the
short
cut
as
it
were
then
i
see
no
reason
why
he
should
not
marry
that
woman
he
is
certainly
justified
since
affection
is
what
romantic
love
must
evolve
into
after
marriage
but
do
not
mistake
me
dane
i
do
not
intend
this
sweepingly
it
will
not
do
for
the
whole
human
herd
for
at
once
enters
that
abhorrent
thing
you
rightly
fear
the
marriage
for
convenience
alas
it
too
often
masquerades
under
the
guise
of
romantic
love
certainly
every
man
is
not
capable
of
taking
this
short
cut
and
at
the
same
time
of
avoiding
a
violation
of
true
sexual
selection
having
little
brain
the
average
man
can
only
act
in
line
with
sexual
selection
by
undergoing
the
romantic
love
malady
but
for
some
few
of
us
and
i
dare
to
include
myself
the
short
cut
is
permissible
this
short
cut
i
shall
take
and
far
be
it
from
any
worldly
sense
of
stocks
and
bonds
and
comfortable
housekeeping
marriage
means
less
to
man
than
to
woman
yes
by
all
means
at
least
to
the
normal
man
or
woman
as
surely
as
reproduction
is
woman
peculiar
function
and
nutrition
man
just
so
surely
does
marriage
sum
up
more
to
woman
than
to
man
it
becomes
the
whole
life
of
the
woman
while
to
the
man
it
is
rather
an
episode
rather
a
mere
side
to
his
life
natural
selection
has
made
it
so
the
countless
men
of
the
past
even
from
before
the
time
they
swung
down
out
of
the
trees
who
devoted
more
time
and
energy
to
their
than
to
the
winning
of
food
and
shelter
died
from
innutrition
in
various
ways
only
the
men
normal
men
with
a
proper
respect
for
the
mechanism
of
life
survived
and
perpetuated
their
kind
the
chance
was
large
that
the
abnormal
lover
did
not
win
a
wife
at
all
at
least
it
is
so
the
abnormal
lover
is
not
a
successful
bidder
for
women
and
is
usually
passed
by
but
while
we
are
on
this
topic
do
not
let
us
forget
dante
alighieri
your
prince
of
lovers
has
a
suitable
explanation
ever
occurred
to
you
concerning
how
he
came
to
marry
gemma
daughter
of
manetto
donati
who
bore
him
seven
children
and
was
never
once
mentioned
in
the
divina
commedia
you
remember
what
he
said
of
his
first
meeting
with
beatrice
at
that
moment
i
saw
most
truly
that
the
spirit
of
life
which
hath
its
dwelling
in
the
secretest
chambers
of
the
heart
began
to
tremble
so
violently
that
the
least
pulses
of
my
body
shook
therewith
and
he
later
had
seven
children
by
gemma
daughter
of
manetto
donati
and
whom
as
the
historian
has
recorded
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
other
than
a
good
wife
as
for
the
primitive
i
hark
back
to
it
because
we
are
still
very
primitive
how
many
thousands
years
of
culture
think
you
have
rubbed
and
polished
at
our
raw
edges
one
probably
at
the
best
not
more
than
two
and
that
takes
us
back
to
screaming
savagery
when
gross
of
body
and
deed
we
drank
blood
from
the
skulls
of
our
enemies
and
hailed
as
highest
paradise
the
orgies
and
carnage
of
valhalla
and
before
that
time
think
you
how
many
thousands
of
years
of
savagery
did
we
endure
and
how
many
myriads
of
thousands
in
the
long
procession
of
life
up
from
the
first
vitalised
inorganic
two
thousand
years
are
an
extremely
thin
veneer
with
which
to
cover
the
many
millions
and
further
our
two
thousand
years
of
culture
is
a
thing
of
the
mind
an
acquired
character
we
are
not
born
with
it
each
must
gather
it
for
himself
after
he
is
born
from
the
spoken
and
written
words
of
his
fellow
and
forerunners
isolate
a
babe
from
all
of
its
kind
and
it
will
never
learn
to
speak
and
without
speech
words
it
can
never
think
save
in
the
concretest
possible
way
yet
it
will
possess
all
the
brute
instincts
and
passions
the
raw
edges
which
do
constantly
shove
through
the
culture
varnish
of
the
civilised
man
our
culture
is
the
last
to
come
the
first
to
go
i
have
seen
it
go
from
a
man
in
an
hour
nay
on
the
instant
our
culture
is
nothing
more
than
the
accumulated
wisdom
of
the
race
it
is
not
part
of
us
not
a
thing
or
attribute
handed
down
from
father
to
son
it
is
a
something
acquired
in
varying
degree
by
each
individual
for
himself
yes
i
do
well
to
hark
back
to
the
primitive
it
tells
me
where
i
am
and
describes
to
me
the
world
i
am
living
in
you
dane
are
or
refined
beyond
the
times
you
are
like
the
idealistic
and
advanced
zealots
who
when
such
action
would
mean
destruction
advise
these
united
states
to
disarm
in
the
face
of
the
world
but
no
more
of
this
jerky
letter
soon
i
shall
proceed
to
make
my
contention
good
i
shall
show
the
higher
part
intellect
plays
in
conjugal
love
the
control
restraint
forbearance
sacrifice
and
i
shall
show
that
conjugal
love
is
higher
and
finer
than
romantic
love

london
queen
road
chelsea
march
clyde
stebbins
was
here
an
hour
after
your
theories
and
definitions
reached
me
the
fact
that
i
had
been
reading
treason
against
his
sister
made
me
pick
my
subjects
a
little
too
carefully
for
smooth
conversation
your
letter
partly
open
was
on
the
table
before
us
and
my
eyes
fell
upon
it
often
as
i
wondered
what
it
would
mean
to
hester
brother
if
he
could
read
it
i
no
longer
think
only
of
you
i
reject
your
definition
of
love
it
is
not
a
disorder
of
the
mind
and
body
nor
is
it
solely
the
instrument
of
reproduction
i
reject
and
resent
your
distinction
between
the
and
states
of
feelings
further
i
hold
that
marriage
may
not
be
based
on
affection
alone
and
i
disagree
with
you
that
population
is
better
than
principle
children
need
not
be
brought
into
the
world
at
any
cost
love
is
not
a
disorder
but
a
growth
there
is
spiritual
as
well
as
physical
growth
some
men
and
women
never
grow
up
strong
enough
to
love
their
development
is
arrested
or
they
are
from
the
beginning
poor
creatures
born
of
starvelings
and
perhaps
fated
to
give
birth
to
pale
sapless
beings
like
themselves
others
there
are
who
love
and
this
is
no
ill
chance
no
disease
of
the
mind
and
body
calling
for
psychiater
and
physician
it
is
a
strength
a
becoming
a
fulfilment
let
us
reason
from
the
effect
to
the
cause
how
does
this
madness
manifest
itself
not
in
weakness
you
never
saw
a
man
or
woman
in
love
who
was
the
worse
for
it
the
lover
carries
all
things
before
him
and
not
for
himself
alone
but
for
a
larger
world
than
ever
had
been
his
he
who
loves
one
must
perforce
love
all
the
world
and
all
the
unborn
worlds
this
is
the
way
life
goes
which
is
another
way
of
saying
it
is
a
scientific
fact
that
which
makes
men
capable
of
consecration
is
not
a
disorder
of
the
mind
and
body
it
is
the
greatest
of
all
forces
and
it
turns
the
wrangling
and
grabbing
human
creature
into
an
inspired
poet
and
the
cause
the
passion
for
perpetuation
and
the
imagination
we
agree
but
there
are
other
and
more
immediate
needs
than
the
need
of
perpetuation
that
call
out
love
needs
that
are
peculiarly
of
the
present
being
bound
up
with
the
steady
outreaching
for
help
for
fellowship
in
the
jerky
journey
through
the
universe
if
love
were
no
more
than
an
instrument
of
reproduction
you
would
be
right
in
maintaining
that
the
fastidiousness
i
insist
on
is
unnecessary
and
unnatural
if
love
were
that
and
that
alone
there
would
be
no
love
which
is
a
paradox
indeed
because
of
our
souls
yearning
that
we
meet
and
mix
in
soul
through
flesh
which
yours
and
mine
wear
and
impress
and
make
their
visible
selves
all
which
means
for
the
love
of
you
and
me
let
us
become
one
flesh
being
one
soul
i
dare
a
formula
in
the
beginning
love
arose
in
the
passion
for
perpetuation
the
passion
for
perpetuation
arises
in
love
just
as
we
put
ourselves
in
the
way
of
natural
selection
pitting
the
microcosm
against
the
macrocosm
in
a
passion
of
ethical
feeling
just
so
do
we
reverse
for
ourselves
processes
that
seem
indeed
to
have
all
the
force
of
law
this
reversal
is
civilisation
the
lover
is
impelled
to
perpetuate
himself
in
the
here
and
the
now
the
law
of
life
exacts
from
him
the
tribute
of
love
imagination
gives
the
lover
the
key
to
the
object
of
his
love
he
enters
and
he
beholds
only
the
ideal
which
is
hers
for
him
her
clay
self
and
the
mere
facts
of
her
do
not
exist
the
conditions
of
love
are
inherent
in
civilisation
when
purpose
is
high
and
feeling
rich
when
the
everlasting
possession
of
the
good
is
desired
then
is
heard
the
i
am
of
love
now
to
my
definition
negatively
love
is
not
a
disorder
of
the
mind
and
body
not
a
madness
since
it
arises
in
the
eternally
most
valuable
since
it
is
the
culmination
of
high
processes
and
since
it
makes
for
sanity
of
vision
and
strength
and
happiness
positively
love
is
the
awakening
of
the
personality
to
the
beauty
and
worth
of
some
one
being
caused
by
the
passion
for
perpetuation
and
by
imagination
it
is
a
desire
to
hold
to
the
good
everlastingly
and
to
merge
with
it
aristotle
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
time
that
women
have
fewer
teeth
than
men
aristotle
was
a
great
man
and
besides
being
a
philosopher
was
the
foremost
scientist
of
his
day
i
can
not
help
thinking
of
this
prodigious
blunder
perhaps
who
knows
the
same
famous
fate
which
a
sexual
classification
of
teeth
enjoys
awaits
a
definition
calling
love
a
disorder
i
will
continue
a
note
has
just
been
given
me
calling
me
to
earl
who
is
ill
but
not
seriously
barbara
has
prescribed
for
him
a
game
of
chess
the
desire
to
see
you
again
has
got
into
my
blood
i
think
i
shall
be
in
the
new
west
and
with
you
before
long
your
friend
always
dane
kempton
xvi
from
the
same
to
the
same
london
sunday
morning
i
must
proceed
with
the
three
other
points
of
my
letter
so
i
shall
stay
here
and
write
though
there
is
a
sharp
breeze
this
morning
and
a
coquettishly
escaping
sunlight
and
something
tugs
at
me
to
go
out
upon
the
city
streets
it
is
not
restlessness
but
the
love
of
the
open
i
am
fain
to
leave
a
walled
house
and
better
still
to
get
outside
of
the
walls
within
and
join
the
city
in
friendship
and
let
the
city
join
me
i
never
feel
greater
fellowship
than
when
i
walk
except
when
i
write
to
you
then
do
i
greaten
with
the
pride
of
life
my
sympathies
quicken
and
i
grow
young
again
i
constitute
myself
advocate
of
the
world
and
enthusiasm
does
not
fail
me
in
this
high
calling
it
is
but
natural
that
in
the
face
of
scepticism
which
i
can
not
share
i
should
feel
greater
faith
that
in
the
face
of
revilement
a
sense
of
the
glory
of
the
thing
belittled
should
settle
upon
me
i
turn
zealot
and
spend
myself
in
praising
i
lay
myself
under
a
spell
of
harmony
because
i
am
serving
and
defending
and
approving
what
i
hold
to
be
good
so
when
you
insist
that
romantic
love
is
and
that
it
dies
at
marriage
as
others
suppose
it
to
die
at
the
approach
of
poverty
i
grow
glad
with
the
knowledge
that
this
is
not
true
i
scrutinize
facts
which
i
hitherto
took
for
granted
and
become
doubly
sure
you
dogmatise
when
you
say
that
the
lover
and
the
husband
are
mutually
exclusive
if
there
was
love
in
the
beginning
it
will
be
at
the
end
love
doubles
upon
itself
propinquity
tightens
bonds
and
there
is
a
steady
blossoming
of
the
character
in
a
radiant
atmosphere
the
marriages
that
fail
are
the
unions
which
are
based
on
liking
in
these
weariness
must
set
in
for
marriage
demands
that
men
and
women
be
all
in
all
to
each
other
and
unless
it
be
so
with
them
the
lives
of
the
contracting
parties
are
by
the
laws
of
logic
and
by
the
force
of
the
laws
of
delicacy
in
the
art
of
living
forever
spoilt
yes
and
people
who
truly
love
come
to
regret
their
married
love
these
too
but
these
have
at
least
begun
well
their
lives
are
infinitely
richer
for
this
fact
their
failure
itself
is
made
by
it
more
bearable
than
the
failure
of
those
others
who
act
the
vulgarian
and
demand
so
little
of
life
that
even
that
little
escapes
them
no
on
these
who
are
at
least
lovers
they
stand
mistaken
but
irreproachable
it
was
neither
their
fault
nor
love
and
life
more
abundant
comes
to
them
even
with
the
mistake
you
are
consistent
just
as
you
maintain
that
love
is
passion
so
do
you
think
that
it
is
no
more
than
a
preliminary
thrill
you
note
a
change
the
flutter
and
the
excitement
felt
in
the
presence
of
the
unknown
go
and
you
do
not
know
that
they
give
place
to
the
steadier
joys
of
the
unknown
that
after
the
promise
comes
the
fulfilment
that
the
hope
is
not
more
beautiful
than
the
realisation
that
there
is
divinity
in
both
and
that
love
does
not
disappoint
tell
me
are
the
placid
marriages
of
affection
you
are
preparing
to
describe
so
very
placid
do
these
jog
along
so
well
is
the
control
restraint
forbearance
sacrifice
of
which
you
speak
as
readily
practised
for
the
person
who
is
that
to
you
which
twenty
others
may
quite
as
easily
be
as
it
is
for
the
one
beyond
all
whom
you
love
and
deify
whom
the
laws
of
your
being
command
that
you
serve
living
and
dying
god
knows
the
average
marriage
does
not
exhibit
a
striking
picture
of
the
practice
of
these
virtues
rather
are
such
phrases
ideals
on
stilts
on
which
suffering
marital
partners
attempt
to
hobble
across
their
extremity
on
the
other
hand
to
some
extent
everybody
practises
restraint
and
sacrifice
since
everybody
is
to
some
extent
moral
but
it
goes
very
hard
with
your
average
man
and
woman
in
your
average
marriage
and
there
is
a
decided
setting
of
the
mouth
and
narrowing
of
the
eyes
with
the
effort
whatever
placidity
there
is
is
attained
by
means
of
vampirism
diderot
the
husband
of
a
stupid
seamstress
had
no
right
to
the
love
of
a
mlle
voland
it
was
vampirism
and
sin
to
take
all
from
this
woman
and
to
return
her
favour
with
so
much
less
than
all
as
surely
as
cowardice
and
selfishness
are
sin
but
the
illicit
relation
will
exist
because
custom
can
not
rid
men
and
women
of
subtle
sympathies
and
dear
yearnings
because
men
and
women
will
love
though
the
world
consider
it
cheap
and
mad
individually
we
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
our
happiness
but
we
are
made
advance
toward
it
through
the
twisted
byways
of
an
unfrank
world
no
straight
road
keep
turning
has
been
the
scream
of
convention
since
convention
began
so
for
every
commonplace
marriage
there
is
a
canonised
love
and
the
story
is
told
in
the
old
greek
civilisation
by
the
hetairæ
you
remember
how
it
reads
in
the
history
the
low
position
generally
assigned
the
wife
in
the
home
had
a
most
disastrous
effect
upon
greek
morals
she
could
exert
no
such
elevating
or
refining
influence
as
she
casts
over
the
modern
home
the
men
were
led
to
seek
social
and
intellectual
sympathy
and
companionship
outside
the
family
circle
among
a
class
of
women
known
as
hetairæ
who
were
esteemed
chiefly
for
their
brilliancy
of
intellect
as
the
most
noted
representative
of
this
class
stands
aspasia
the
friend
of
pericles
the
influence
of
the
hetairæ
was
most
harmful
to
social
morality
and
the
practice
persisted
through
many
a
renaissance
where
lauras
and
beatrices
were
besung
down
to
the
brilliant
encyclopædists
of
the
eighteenth
century
with
their
avowed
loves
down
to
our
goethe
and
john
stuart
mill
all
of
these
loves
rose
in
very
different
motives
and
environments
yet
were
they
the
same
fundamentally
strong
sweet
love
between
man
and
woman
very
much
spoiled
by
the
fact
that
custom
permitted
the
loveless
marriage
at
the
same
time
but
yet
love
which
was
good
since
it
was
the
best
that
could
be
had
and
when
the
historian
permits
himself
to
say
the
influence
of
the
hetairæ
was
most
harmful
to
social
morality
it
is
evident
that
he
also
thinks
that
a
marriage
which
compels
husband
or
wife
to
seek
help
elsewhere
than
in
their
union
is
bad
and
wrong
there
is
a
change
in
attitude
woman
is
in
strength
and
dignity
and
the
highest
chivalry
the
world
has
ever
known
is
in
blossom
she
is
an
equal
a
comrade
a
right
regal
person
she
is
no
longer
a
means
but
an
end
in
herself
not
alone
fit
to
mother
men
but
fit
to
live
in
equality
with
men
i
repeat
she
is
not
a
means
but
an
individual
with
a
soul
of
her
own
to
rear
because
of
the
greater
and
more
general
emancipation
of
woman
the
subtlety
of
modern
love
has
become
possible
now
for
the
last
point
the
question
of
perpetuation
just
as
function
precedes
organ
so
the
love
of
life
is
inherent
in
the
living
for
the
maintenance
of
life
but
even
the
primitive
man
in
whom
instinct
is
strongest
proves
himself
capable
of
death
some
men
have
always
been
able
to
give
up
their
lives
for
some
cause
indeed
there
is
thought
to
be
suicide
amongst
animals
and
we
certainly
no
longer
say
a
man
must
live
quite
as
often
must
he
die
men
have
found
it
wise
to
die
at
the
stake
or
on
the
gallows
if
this
be
true
of
our
relation
to
the
life
which
courses
through
us
how
much
more
true
is
it
of
our
instinct
to
perpetuate
ourselves
which
pertains
to
the
love
of
life
biologically
only
which
is
often
in
the
social
manifestation
of
that
instinct
a
cold
intellectual
concept
and
never
a
dominating
thought
we
are
not
driven
to
procreate
in
fact
every
child
born
into
the
world
competes
hard
for
its
morsel
under
our
unimaginable
economic
régime
all
increase
in
population
is
a
menace
i
call
bringing
children
into
the
world
a
codfish
act
which
causes
an
overflux
of
vulgar
little
earthlings
if
the
process
be
not
humanised
and
spiritualised
if
the
child
is
conceived
not
in
lust
but
in
love
it
is
rightly
born
if
it
is
the
child
of
your
ideal
the
offspring
of
that
which
is
your
truest
life
then
is
your
progeny
your
immortality
and
then
and
then
only
have
you
reason
for
pride
and
joy
in
that
which
you
have
caused
to
be
my
dear
dear
herbert
my
love
has
not
failed
this
you
must
come
to
understand
love
never
fails
the
children
that
might
have
been
mine
are
better
unborn
since
i
could
not
give
them
a
mother
whom
i
loved
you
remind
me
that
dante
married
gemma
daughter
of
manetto
donati
and
she
bore
him
seven
children
yet
herbert
was
this
wife
not
mentioned
in
the
commedia
nor
in
la
vita
nuova
nor
anywhere
else
in
his
writings
dante
was
a
conformist
he
was
not
in
all
respects
above
his
time
witness
his
theology
convention
permitted
the
dispassionate
marriage
side
by
side
with
love
he
was
conventional
and
the
infinite
moment
of
meeting
in
paradise
with
his
lady
was
embittered
by
her
cold
lessoned
smiles
ah
from
what
agonies
of
heart
and
brain
what
exultations
trampling
on
despair
what
tenderness
what
tears
what
hate
of
wrong
what
passionate
outcry
of
a
soul
in
pain
uprose
this
poem
of
the
earth
and
air
this
mediaeval
miracle
of
song
it
was
for
beatrice
that
this
man
vexed
his
spirit
with
immortal
effort
and
raised
a
titan
voice
which
yet
is
heard
in
charmed
echoes
it
was
for
beatrice
that
he
descended
into
the
dead
regions
and
climbed
the
hills
of
purgatory
and
soared
towards
the
rose
of
paradise
and
where
is
she
instantly
i
cried
dante
our
prince
of
lovers
might
have
lived
better
but
he
loved
well
this
in
answer
to
your
letter
to
meet
your
argument
i
have
found
it
best
to
employ
something
of
your
own
method
but
i
can
not
rid
myself
of
the
feeling
that
i
have
vulgarised
the
subject
by
saying
so
much
about
it
i
fear
my
letter
would
provoke
a
smile
from
those
who
know
love
and
the
wonder
of
its
simplicity
through
all
the
subtlety
we
in
loving
have
no
cause
to
speak
so
much
would
be
their
unanswerable
criticism
it
is
easier
to
live
than
to
argue
about
life
the
thought
has
suddenly
assailed
me
that
what
i
have
said
may
sound
derogatory
to
hester
know
then
that
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
woman
in
the
world
who
is
not
capable
of
inspiring
true
and
abiding
love
in
the
heart
of
some
man
besides
hester
to
me
looms
up
as
a
heroine
not
a
hair
breadth
of
what
i
know
of
her
that
is
not
beautiful
my
regret
is
that
she
who
could
be
a
vision
eterne
should
be
doomed
to
receive
episodically
your
considerate
affection
she
does
not
know
your
programme
she
is
a
girl
who
takes
your
love
for
granted
in
the
same
way
as
she
gives
hers
without
niggardliness
it
is
the
woman
who
can
not
be
content
with
less
than
all
that
is
slowly
starved
to
death
on
a
diet
and
who
does
not
find
it
out
until
the
end
until
the
carnival
time
when
you
and
hester
come
to
love
each
other
if
that
time
is
to
be
you
two
must
be
as
separate
in
deed
as
you
are
in
fact
forgive
me
and
write
soon
yours
ever
dane
xvii
from
herbert
wace
to
dane
kempton
the
ridge
berkeley
california
april
so
you
have
met
hester
brother
well
i
have
had
an
outing
with
hester
she
loves
me
well
i
know
and
i
can
not
but
confess
a
thrill
at
the
thought
on
the
other
hand
well
do
i
know
the
significance
of
that
love
the
significance
and
the
cause
notwithstanding
that
wonderful
soul
of
hers
she
is
in
no
wise
constituted
differently
from
her
millions
of
sisters
on
the
planet
she
loves
she
knows
not
why
she
knows
only
that
she
loves
in
other
words
she
does
not
reason
her
emotions
but
let
us
reason
we
men
after
the
manner
of
men
and
be
thou
patient
dane
and
follow
me
down
and
under
the
phenomena
of
love
to
things
sexless
and
loveless
and
from
there
as
the
proper
point
of
departure
let
us
return
and
chart
love
its
phases
and
occurrences
from
its
first
beginnings
to
its
last
manifestations
things
sexless
and
loveless
yes
and
as
such
may
be
classed
the
drops
of
life
known
as
unicellular
organisms
such
a
creature
is
a
tiny
cell
capable
of
performing
in
itself
all
the
functions
of
life
that
one
pulsating
morsel
of
matter
is
invested
with
an
irritability
which
as
herbert
spencer
says
enables
it
to
adjust
the
inner
relations
with
outer
relations
to
correspond
to
its
environment
in
short
to
live
that
single
cell
contracts
and
recoils
from
the
things
in
its
environment
uncongenial
to
its
constitution
and
the
things
congenial
it
draws
to
itself
and
absorbs
it
has
no
mouth
no
stomach
no
alimentary
canal
it
is
all
mouth
all
stomach
all
alimentary
canal
but
at
that
low
plane
the
functions
of
life
are
few
and
simple
this
bit
of
vitalised
inorganic
has
no
sex
and
because
of
that
it
can
not
love
reproduction
is
growth
when
it
grows
it
splits
in
half
and
where
was
one
cell
there
are
two
nor
can
the
parent
cell
be
called
or
and
for
that
matter
the
parent
cell
can
not
be
determined
the
original
cell
split
into
two
cells
one
has
as
much
claim
to
parenthood
as
the
other
it
lives
dimly
to
be
sure
this
mote
of
life
and
light
but
before
it
is
a
vast
evolution
dane
on
the
pinnacle
of
which
are
to
be
found
men
and
women
hester
stebbins
my
mother
you
a
step
higher
we
find
the
cell
cluster
and
with
it
begins
that
differentiation
which
has
continued
to
this
day
and
which
still
continues
simplicity
has
yielded
to
complexity
and
a
new
epoch
of
life
been
inaugurated
the
outer
cells
of
the
cluster
are
more
exposed
to
environmental
forces
than
are
the
inner
cells
they
cohere
more
tenaciously
and
a
rudimentary
skin
is
formed
through
the
pores
of
this
skin
food
is
absorbed
and
in
these
pores
is
foreshadowed
the
mouth
division
of
labour
has
set
in
and
groups
of
cells
specialise
in
the
performance
of
functions
thus
a
cell
group
forms
the
skinny
covering
of
the
cluster
another
cell
group
the
mouth
and
likewise
internally
the
stomach
a
sac
for
the
reception
and
digestion
of
food
takes
shape
and
the
juices
of
the
body
begin
to
circulate
with
greater
definiteness
breaking
channels
in
their
passage
and
keeping
those
channels
open
and
as
the
generations
pass
still
more
groups
of
cells
segregate
themselves
from
the
mass
and
the
heart
the
lungs
the
liver
and
other
internal
organs
are
formed
the
organism
develops
a
bony
structure
muscles
by
which
to
move
itself
and
a
nervous
system
be
not
bored
dane
and
be
not
offended
these
are
our
ancestors
and
their
history
is
our
history
remember
that
as
surely
as
we
one
day
swung
down
out
of
the
trees
and
walked
upright
just
so
surely
on
a
far
earlier
day
did
we
crawl
up
out
of
the
sea
and
achieve
our
first
adventure
on
land
but
to
be
brief
in
the
course
of
specialisation
of
function
as
i
have
outlined
just
as
other
organs
arose
so
arose
previous
to
that
time
there
was
no
sex
a
single
organism
realised
all
potentialities
fulfilled
all
functions
male
and
female
the
creative
factors
were
incoherently
commingled
such
an
individual
was
both
male
and
female
it
was
complete
in
itself
mark
this
dane
for
here
individual
completeness
ends
the
labour
of
reproduction
was
divided
and
male
and
female
as
separate
entities
came
into
the
world
they
shared
the
work
of
reproduction
between
them
neither
was
complete
alone
each
was
the
complement
of
the
other
in
times
and
seasons
each
felt
a
vital
need
for
the
other
and
in
the
satisfying
of
this
vital
need
of
this
yearning
for
completeness
we
have
the
first
manifestation
of
love
male
and
female
loved
they
one
another
but
dimly
dane
we
would
not
call
it
love
yet
it
foreshadowed
love
as
the
pore
foreshadowed
the
mouth
as
long
and
tedious
as
has
been
the
development
of
this
rudimentary
love
to
the
highly
evolved
love
of
just
so
long
and
tedious
would
be
my
sketch
of
that
development
however
the
factors
may
be
hinted
the
increasing
correspondence
of
life
with
its
environment
brought
about
wider
and
wider
generalisations
upon
that
environment
and
the
relations
of
the
individual
to
it
there
is
no
missing
link
to
the
chain
that
connects
the
first
and
lowest
life
to
the
last
and
the
highest
there
is
no
gap
between
the
physical
and
psychical
from
reflex
on
and
up
through
reflex
and
the
passage
is
made
without
break
to
and
hand
in
hand
with
these
all
acting
and
reacting
upon
one
another
comes
the
development
of
the
imagination
and
of
the
higher
passions
feelings
and
emotions
but
all
of
this
is
in
the
books
and
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
go
over
the
ground
so
let
me
sum
up
with
an
analysis
of
that
most
exquisite
of
themes
a
maiden
in
love
in
the
first
place
this
maiden
must
come
of
an
ancestry
mastered
by
the
passion
for
perpetuation
it
is
only
through
those
so
mastered
that
the
line
comes
down
the
individual
perishes
you
know
for
it
is
the
race
that
lives
in
this
maiden
is
incorporated
all
the
experience
of
the
race
this
race
experience
is
her
heritage
her
function
is
to
pass
it
on
to
posterity
if
she
is
disobedient
she
is
unfruitful
her
line
ceases
with
her
and
she
is
without
avail
among
the
generations
to
come
and
be
it
not
forgotten
there
are
many
obedient
whose
lines
pass
down
but
this
maiden
is
obedient
by
her
acts
she
will
link
the
past
to
the
future
bind
together
the
two
eternities
but
she
is
incomplete
this
maiden
and
being
immature
she
is
unaware
of
her
incompleteness
nevertheless
she
is
the
creature
of
the
law
of
the
race
and
from
her
infancy
she
prepares
herself
for
the
task
she
is
to
perform
hers
is
a
certain
definite
organism
somewhat
different
from
all
other
female
organisms
consequently
there
is
one
male
in
all
the
world
whose
organism
is
most
nearly
the
complement
of
hers
one
male
for
whom
she
will
feel
the
greatest
intensest
and
most
vital
need
one
male
who
of
all
males
is
the
fittest
organically
to
be
the
father
of
her
children
and
so
in
pinafores
and
pigtails
she
plays
with
little
boys
and
likes
and
dislikes
according
to
her
organic
need
she
comes
in
contact
with
all
manner
of
boys
from
the
butcher
boy
to
the
son
of
her
friend
and
likewise
with
men
from
the
gardener
to
her
associates
and
she
is
more
or
less
attracted
by
those
who
in
greater
or
less
degree
answer
to
her
organic
demand
or
as
it
were
organic
ideal
and
upon
creatures
male
she
early
proceeds
to
generalise
this
kind
of
man
she
likes
that
she
does
not
like
and
this
kind
she
likes
more
than
that
kind
she
does
not
know
why
she
does
this
nor
with
the
highest
probability
does
she
know
she
is
doing
it
she
simply
has
her
likes
and
dislikes
that
is
all
she
is
the
slave
of
the
law
unwittingly
generalising
upon
against
the
day
when
she
must
identify
the
male
who
most
nearly
completes
her
she
drifts
across
the
magic
borderland
to
womanhood
where
dreams
and
fancies
rise
and
intermingle
and
the
realities
of
life
are
lost
a
dissatisfaction
and
a
restlessness
come
upon
her
there
seems
no
sanity
in
things
and
life
is
she
is
filled
with
vague
troubled
yearnings
and
the
woman
in
her
quickens
and
cries
out
for
unity
it
is
an
organic
cry
old
as
the
race
and
she
can
not
shut
out
the
sound
of
it
or
still
the
clamour
in
her
blood
but
there
is
one
male
in
all
the
world
who
is
most
nearly
her
complement
and
he
may
be
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
where
she
may
not
find
him
so
propinquity
determines
her
fate
of
the
males
she
is
in
contact
with
the
one
who
can
more
nearly
give
her
the
completeness
she
craves
will
be
the
one
she
loves
all
of
which
is
well
and
good
in
its
way
but
let
us
analyze
further
what
is
all
this
but
the
symptoms
of
an
extreme
and
nervous
disorder
the
equilibrium
of
the
organism
has
been
overthrown
and
there
is
a
wild
scrambling
for
the
restoration
of
that
equilibrium
the
choice
made
may
be
good
or
ill
as
chance
and
time
may
dictate
but
the
impelling
excitement
forces
a
choice
what
if
it
be
ill
what
if
a
male
who
is
a
far
better
complement
should
appear
the
time
is
now
nature
is
not
neglectful
and
well
she
knows
the
disaster
of
delay
she
is
prodigal
of
the
individual
and
is
satisfied
with
one
match
out
of
many
mismatches
just
as
she
is
satisfied
that
of
a
million
cod
eggs
one
only
should
develop
into
a
cod
and
so
this
love
of
the
human
in
no
wise
differs
from
that
of
the
sparrow
which
forgets
preservation
in
procreation
thus
nature
tricks
her
creatures
and
the
race
lives
on
for
the
lesser
creatures
the
trick
serves
the
purpose
well
there
is
need
for
a
compelling
madness
else
would
overcome
procreation
and
there
be
no
lesser
creatures
and
man
is
content
to
rest
coequal
with
the
beast
in
the
matter
of
mating
notwithstanding
his
intelligence
which
has
made
him
the
master
of
matter
and
enabled
him
to
enslave
the
great
blind
forces
he
is
unable
to
perpetuate
his
species
without
the
aid
of
the
impelling
madness
nay
men
will
not
have
it
otherwise
and
when
an
individual
urges
that
his
reason
has
placed
him
above
the
beast
and
that
without
the
impelling
madness
he
can
mate
with
greater
wisdom
and
potency
then
the
poets
and
singers
rise
up
and
fling
potsherds
at
him
to
improve
upon
nature
by
draining
a
malarial
swamp
is
permitted
him
to
improve
upon
nature
methods
and
breed
swifter
and
finer
horses
than
she
has
ever
bred
is
also
permitted
but
to
improve
upon
nature
in
the
breeding
of
the
human
that
is
a
sacrilege
which
can
not
be
condoned
down
with
him
he
is
a
brute
to
question
our
divine
love
and
glorious
ah
dane
remember
the
first
dim
yearning
of
divided
life
and
the
soils
and
smirches
and
frenzies
put
upon
it
by
the
spawn
of
multitudinous
generations
there
is
your
love
the
whole
history
of
it
there
is
no
intrinsic
shame
in
the
thing
itself
but
the
shame
lies
in
that
we
are
not
greater
than
it
herbert

from
the

to

same
the
ridge
berkeley
california

there
were
several
things
in
your
letter
which
i
forgot
to
answer
much
of
beauty
and
wonder
is
there
in
what
you
have
said
and
unrelated
facts
without
end
many
of
those
facts
i
endorse
heartily
but
it
seems
to
me
you
fail
to
embody
them
in
a
coherent
argument
i
have
stated
in
so
many
words
that
there
are
two
functions
common
to
all
life
nutrition
and
reproduction
of
this
you
have
missed
the
significance
in
your
rejection
of
my
definition
of
love
so
i
must
explain
further
unless
these
two
functions
be
carried
on
life
must
perish
from
the
planet
therefore
they
are
the
most
essential
concerns
of
life
the
individual
must
preserve
its
own
life
and
the
life
of
its
kind
it
is
more
prone
to
preserve
its
own
life
than
the
life
of
its
kind
less
prone
to
sacrifice
itself
for
its
species
so
natural
selection
has
developed
a
passion
of
madness
which
forces
the
individual
to
make
the
sacrifice
in
all
forms
of
life
below
man
the
struggle
for
existence
is
keen
and
merciless
the
least
weakness
in
an
individual
is
the
signal
for
its
destruction
therefore
it
is
counter
to
the
welfare
of
the
individual
to
do
aught
that
will
tend
to
weaken
it
on
the
other
hand
the
law
is
that
the
individual
must
procreate
but
procreation
means
a
weakening
and
a
temporary
state
of
helplessness
problem
how
may
the
individual
be
brought
to
procreate
to
do
that
which
is
inimical
to
its
welfare
answer
it
must
be
forced
by
something
deeper
than
reason
and
that
something
is
unreasoning
passion
did
the
individual
reason
on
the
matter
it
would
certainly
abstain
it
is
because
the
passion
is
not
rational
that
life
has
persisted
to
this
day
man
coming
up
from
the
walks
of
lower
life
brought
with
him
this
most
necessary
passion
developing
imagination
he
commingled
the
two
love
was
the
product
now
because
of
our
imagination
do
not
let
us
confuse
the
issue
the
great
task
demanded
of
man
is
reproduction
he
is
urged
by
passion
to
perform
this
task
passion
working
through
the
imagination
produces
love
passion
is
the
impelling
factor
imagination
the
disturbing
factor
and
the
disturbance
of
passion
by
imagination
produces
love
stripped
of
all
its
superfluities
what
function
does
love
serve
in
the
scheme
of
life
that
of
reproduction
nay
now
do
not
object
dane
for
you
state
the
same
thing
though
less
clearly
in
your
own
definition
of
love
you
say
love
is
the
awakening
of
the
personality
to
the
beauty
and
worth
of
some
one
being
and
is
a
desire
to
merge
the
life
with
that
of
the
beloved
being
in
other
words
your
definition
tells
that
the
passion
for
perpetuation
is
the
cause
of
love
and
perpetuation
the
end
to
be
accomplished
thus
nature
tricks
her
creatures
and
the
race
lives
on
then
you
say
negatively
love
is
not
a
disorder
of
mind
and
body
not
a
madness
since
it
arises
in
the
eternally
most
valuable
since
it
is
the
culmination
of
high
processes
and
since
it
makes
for
strength
and
sanity
of
vision
and
happiness
i
have
shown
the
value
of
passion
and
the
processes
of
which
love
is
the
culmination
and
i
have
shown
that
both
are
unreasoning
and
why
they
are
unreasoning
do
you
demonstrate
where
i
am
wrong
then
again
you
dare
a
formula
in
the
beginning
love
arose
in
the
passion
for
perpetuation
the
passion
for
perpetuation
arises
in
love
it
is
clever
but
is
it
true
yes
as
true
as
this
formula
i
dare
to
pattern
after
yours
in
the
beginning
man
ate
because
he
was
hungry
he
is
hungry
because
he
eats
there
are
many
things
more
i
should
like
to
answer
but
i
am

nature

that

so
marvellous
nature
tricks

and
the

and
i
am
prayerfully
grateful
the
difference
between
us
is
that
you
are
not
you
are
suffering
from
what
has
been
well
called
the
sadness
of
science
you
accept
the
thesis
of
a
common
origin
only
to
regret
it
you
discover
that
romance
has
a
history
and
lo
romance
has
vanished
you
are
a
werther
of
science
sad
to
the
heart
with
a
melancholy
all
your
own
and
dropping
inert
tears
on
the
shrine
of
your
accumulated
facts
in
this
you
are
with
your
generation
just
as
every
age
has
its
prevailing
disease
of
the
body
so
has
it
its
characteristic
spiritual
ailment
we
are
in
the
throes
of
travail
in
our
arms
is
the
child
of
our
intellect
but
another
deliverance
is
about
to
be
and
the
suffering
is
great
after
science
comes
the
philosophy
of
science
our
eyes
are
bathed
in
revelation
but
upon
our
ears
the
music
of
the
word
has
not
yet
fallen
until
that
time
when
the
meaning
of
it
all
shall
flash
out
upon
the
world
the
race
will
be
hidebound
in
callousness
and
in
melancholy
as
yet
we
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
all
which
we
know
and
we
are
afflicted
with
the
pessimism
of
inertia
and
the
pessimism
of
dyspepsia
intellectually
we
have
been
living
too
high
the
last
hundred
years
or
so
in
this
is
the
secret
of
our
difference
you
insist
upon
cheapening
life
for
yourself
because
it
has
become
evident
to
you
that
the
phenomenon
is
common
and
i
on
the
other
hand
shout
its
glory
because
it
is
universal
to
myself
i
am
breathless
with
wonder
but
to
you
and
in
my
work
i
needs
must
shout
it
here
let
me
be
clear
i
take
it
that
you
are
under
the
sway
of
a
contemporary
mood
that
your
position
is
an
accidental
phase
of
materialism
broadly
our
quarrel
is
that
of
pessimism
and
optimism
only
your
pessimism
is
unconscious
which
makes
it
the
more
dangerous
to
yourself
you
are
too
sad
to
know
that
you
are
not
happy
or
to
care
does
my
diagnosis
surprise
you
analyze
the
argument
of
your
last
letter
you
trace
the
growth
of
the
emotion
of
love
from
protoplasm
to
man
you
follow
the
progress
of
the
force
which
is
stronger
than
hunger
and
cold
and
swifter
and
more
final
than
death
from
its
potential
state
in
the
unicellular
stage
where
life
goes
on
by
division
up
through
the
multifarious
forms
of
instinctive
animal
mating
till
you
reach
the
love
of
the
sexes
in
the
human
world
and
the
exploring
leads
you
to
the
belief
that
nothing
has
been
reserved
for
the
human
worth
his
cherishing
to
the
conviction
that
the
plan
of
life
is
simple
and
unvaried
and
therefore
unacceptable
you
raise
the
wail
of
ecclesiastes
all
is
vanity
and
a
striving
after
wind
and
there
is
no
profit
under
the
sun
the
preacher
and
omar
and
swinburne
are
pathetically
human
and
we
who
are
also
human
respond
to
their
finality
to
their
quizzical
indifference
and
their
stinging
resentment
we
also
say
vanity
of
vanities
and
bow
our
heads
murmuring
ilicet
and
stretch
out
our
hands
to
turn
down
an
empty
glass
but
all
this
in
twilight
moods
when
a
dimness
as
of
dying
rests
upon
the
soul
there
are
a
few
with
whom
it
is
always
morning
and
others
who
remember
something
of
the
radiance
of
the
young
day
even
in
the
heart
of
midnight
these
disprove
the
postulates
of
sameness
and
satiety
these
are
not
smitten
by
the
seen
fact
as
are
you
of
the
microscopic
retina
these
see
life
steadily
and
see
it
whole
we
need
not
fear
the
label
of
an
idea
when
i
say
that
your
position
is
that
of
the
pessimist
it
is
not
more
of
an
accusation
than
if
i
said
it
was
that
of
the
optimist
the
thing
to
concern
oneself
with
is
the
question
which
of
these
makes
the
nearer
approach
to
the
truth
you
have
been
asking
me
what
is
love
worth
and
you
have
answered
your
question
often
enough
and
to
your
satisfaction
in
itself
it
is
worth
nothing
being
but
the
catspaw
to
scheming
forces
with
your
denial
of
any
intrinsic
beauty
in
the
emotion
with
your
acceptance
of
it
as
an
unfortunate
incident
in
human
affairs
comes
a
vague
hope
that
the
race
will
outgrow
this
force
here
is
your
rift
in
the
cloud
you
picture
a
scientific
utopia
where
there
are
no
lovers
and
no
to
the
primitive
passion
and
you
appoint
yourself
pioneer
to
the
promised
land
of
the
children
of
biology
ah
i
speak
as
if
i
were
vexed
instead
of
simply
being
sure
i
am
in
the
right
i
wish
to
help
you
to
see
that
there
is
another
reading
to
your
facts
if
love
is
essentially
the
same
from
protoplasm
to
man
it
does
not
for
this
reason
become
worthless
by
virtue
of
being
universal
it
is
enhanced
and
most
divinely
humanly
binding
you
tell
me
that
love
is
involuntary
compelled
by
external
forces
as
old
as
time
and
as
binding
as
instinct
and
i
say
that
because
of
this
life
is
finally
for
love
what
the
cavemen
and
the
birds
too
and
the
fish
and
the
plants
forsooth
what
the
inorganic
perhaps
as
well
as
the
organic
swayed
by
this
force
which
is
wholly
physical
and
yet
wholly
psychical
and
does
it
not
fire
you
you
are
not
caught
up
and
held
by
this
giant
fact
you
find
that
love
is
not
sporadic
not
individual
that
it
does
not
begin
with
you
or
end
with
you
that
it
does
not
dissociate
you
and
you
do
not
warm
to
the
kinship
you
do
not
hear
the
overword
of
the
poets
and
philosophers
of
all
times
you
do
not
see
the
visions
that
gladdened
the
nights
of
saints
the
same
surprise
sweeps
over
the
mind
in
reading
ecclesiastes
is
it
a
sorry
scheme
of
things
that
one
generation
goes
and
another
comes
and
the
world
abides
forever
if
the
same
generation
peopled
the
earth
for
a
million
years
the
dignity
of
life
would
not
be
increased
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
the
assurance
of
eternal
life
as
the
dole
for
having
come
to
be
in
order
to
live
under
the
aspect
of
eternity
it
is
larger
to
be
to
be
but
a
wave
of
the
sea
rolling
for
one
sunful
day
and
starry
night
towards
a
great
inclusiveness
it
is
a
higher
majesty
to
be
inalien
and
a
part
a
ringed
ripple
in
the
vastness
than
to
lie
broad
and
smiling
in
meaningless
endlessness
so
it
is
a
strange
thing
that
men
who
are
schooled
by
evolution
to
relate
themselves
to
all
that
exists
and
to
seek
for
new
kinships
should
lament
that
there
is
no
new
thing
under
the
sun
and
whose
eye
would
be
satisfied
with
seeing
and
whose
ear
with
hearing
who
would
rather
have
the
truth
than
the
power
to
seek
it
there
is
a
way
of
reading
ecclesiastes
and
schopenhauer
with
a
triumphant
lilt
in
the
voice
after
all
it
is
the
modulation
that
carries
the
message
of
the
text
when
you
write
the
history
of
love
i
find
it
fair
reading
when
you
tell
me
love
is
primal
and
engrossing
i
hold
it
the
more
a
sin
to
crouch
away
from
its
fires
love
is
the
assertion
of
the
will
to
live
as
a
definitely
determined
individual
this
is
schopenhauer
thesis
and
unnecessarily
enough
he
apologises
for
it
as
if
it
belittled
love
to
say
that
it
affects
man
in
his
the
genius
of
the
race
takes
the
lover
conscript
and
makes
him
a
soldier
in
life
battalions
the
genius
of
the
race
a
metaphysical
term
but
meaning
what
you
do
when
you
speak
of
the
function
of
love
schopenhauer
is
a
pessimist
consciously
you
unconsciously
and
you
have
both
missed
the
living
value
of
your
facts
love
is
ruled
by
race
welfare
says
schopenhauer
it
the
race
welfare
alone
corresponds
to
the
profoundness
with
which
it
is
felt
to
the
seriousness
with
which
it
appears
to
the
importance
which
it
attributes
even
to
the
trifling
details
of
its
sphere
and
occasion
love
concerns
itself
with
the
composition
of
the
next
generation
therefore
you
find
it
common
as
the
commonplace
therefore
schopenhauer
regards
it
as
a
force
treacherous
to
happiness
since
to
live
is
to
be
miserable
these
lovers
are
the
traitors
who
seek
to
perpetuate
the
whole
want
and
drudgery
which
would
otherwise
speedily
reach
an
end
this
they
wish
to
frustrate
as
others
like
them
have
frustrated
it
before
because
love
frustrates
the
death
of
the
race
it
is
the
joy
of
my
senses
and
the
goal
of
my
striving
says
schopenhauer
through
love
man
shows
that
the
species
lies
closer
to
him
than
the
individual
and
he
lives
more
immediately
in
the
former
than
in
the
latter
why
does
the
lover
hang
with
complete
abandon
on
the
eyes
of
his
chosen
one
and
is
ready
to
make
every
sacrifice
for
her
it
is
his
immortal
part
that
longs
after
her
while
it
is
merely
his
mortal
part
that
desires
everything
because
this
is
so
love
is
the
god
of
my
faith
you
see
where
our
subject
takes
us
and
all
the
while
i
care
nothing
for
the
points
of
argument
except
where
they
prick
you
from
your
position
one
must
scale
the
skies
and
swim
the
seas
in
order
to
reach
you
well
have
i
approached
within
your
hearing
i
was
sitting
amongst
the
fennel
in
barbara
garden
when
your
letter
was
brought
and
i
read
it
twice
to
make
sure
i
understood
when
the
sun
lies
warm
on
waving
fennel
and
a
city
is
before
you
mysterious
in
a
veil
of
mist
it
is
easier
to
feel
love
than
to
think
about
it
for
a
while
it
was
difficult
to
see
the
bearing
of
the
data
which
you
marshalled
so
well
in
defence
of
your
denial
you
went
far
in
order
to
answer
why
you
are
content
to
marry
a
woman
you
do
not
love
your
methods
are
not
the
methods
of
the
practical
mind
i
am
glad
for
that
you
idealise
your
attitude
you
go
far
back
in
time
you
enmesh
yourself
in
theories
and
generalisations
you
ride
your
imagination
proudly
in
order
to
reconcile
yourself
to
something
which
suggests
itself
as
more
ideal
than
that
for
which
the
unreasoning
heart
hungers
you
are
sad
but
you
are
not
practical
and
you
are
not
blasé
of
barbara
of
myself
and
of
london
doings
this
is
no
time
to
write
tell
hester
your
friend
thinks
of
her
yours
with
great
memories
and
greater
hopes

from

to
dane
kempton
the
ridge
berkeley
california
may
i
stand
aloof
and
laugh
at
myself
and
you
oh
believe
me
i
see
it
very
clearly
myself
in
the
heyday
and
cocksureness
of
youth
flinging
at
you
with
much
energy
and
little
skill
my
immature
generalisations
from
science
and
you
with
an
elderly
beneficence
and
tolerance
smiling
shrewdly
and
affectionately
upon
me
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
sooner
or
later
i
am
sure
to
get
through
with
it
all
and
join
you
in
your
broad
and
placid
philosophy
it
is
the
penalty
age
exacts
from
youth
well
i
accept
it
so
i
am
suffering
from
the
sadness
of
science
i
had
been
prone
to
ascribe
my
feelings
to
the
passion
of
science
but
it
does
not
matter
in
the
least
only
somehow
i
would
rather
you
did
not
misunderstand
me
so
dreadfully
i
do
not
raise
the
wail
of
ecclesiastes
i
am
not
sad
but
glad
i
discover
romance
has
a
history
and
in
history
i
am
quicker
to
read
the
romance
i
accept
the
thesis
of
a
common
origin
not
to
regret
it
but
to
make
the
best
of
it
that
is
the
key
to
my
life
to
make
the
best
of
it
but
not
drearily
with
the
passiveness
of
a
slave
but
passionately
and
with
desire
invention
is
an
artifice
man
employs
to
overcome
the
roundabout
it
is
the
short
cut
to
satisfaction
it
makes
man
potent
so
that
he
can
do
more
things
in
a
span
i
am
a
worker
and
doer
the
common
origin
is
not
a
despair
to
me
it
has
a
value
and
it
strengthens
my
arm
in
the
work
to
be
done
the
play
and
interplay
of
force
and
matter
we
call
evolution
the
more
man
understands
force
and
matter
and
the
play
and
interplay
the
more
is
he
enabled
to
direct
the
trend
of
evolution
at
least
in
human
affairs
here
is
a
great
and
weltering
mass
of
individuals
which
we
call
society
the
problem
is
how
may
it
be
directed
so
that
the
sum
of
its
happiness
greatens
this
is
my
work
i
would
invent
overcome
the
roundabout
seek
the
short
cut
and
i
consider
all
matter
all
force
all
factors
so
that
i
may
invent
wisely
and
justly
and
considering
all
factors
i
consider
romance
and
i
consider
you
i
weigh
your
value
in
the
scheme
of
things
and
your
necessity
and
i
find
that
you
are
both
valuable
and
necessary
but
the
history
of
progress
is
the
history
of
the
elimination
of
waste
one
boy
running
machines
turns
out
a
thousand
pairs
of
socks
a
day
his
granny
toiled
a
thousand
days
to
do
the
same
waste
has
been
eliminated
the
roundabout
overcome
and
so
with
romance
i
strive
not
to
be
blinded
by
its
beauty
but
to
give
it
exact
appraisal
oftentimes
it
is
the
roundabout
the
wasteful
and
must
needs
be
eliminated
thus
chivalry
and
its
romance
vanished
before
the
chemist
and
the
engineer
before
the
man
who
mixed
gunpowder
and
the
man
who
dug
ditches
i
melancholy
sir
i
have
not
the
time
so
may
i
model
my
answer
after
the
great
agassiz
i
am
not
a
werther
of
science
but
rather
you
are
a
john
ruskin
of
these
latter
days
he
wept
at
the
profanation
of
the
world
at
the
violating
the
sanctity
of
the
venetian
canals
and
the
electric
cars
running
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
pyramids
and
you
weep
at
the
violation
of
like
sanctities
in
the
spiritual
world
a
gondola
is
more
beautiful
but
the
takes
one
places
and
an
electric
car
is
more
comfortable
than
the
hump
of
a
camel
it
is
too
bad
but
waste
romance
as
waste
energy
must
be
eliminated
enough
i
shall
go
on
with
the
argument
i
have
drawn
the
line
between
love
and
love
the
former
which
is
the
real
sexual
love
the
love
of
which
the
poets
sing
and
which
makes
the
world
go
round
i
have
called
romantic
love
the
latter
which
in
actuality
is
sex
comradeship
i
call
conjugal
affection
or
friendship
to
be
more
definite
i
shall
call
the
one
love
the
other
affection
or
friendship
now
love
is
not
affection
or
friendship
yet
they
are
ofttimes
mistaken
one
for
the
other
for
it
so
happens
that
the
friendship
which
is
akin
to
conjugal
affection
is
in
many
instances
in
its
development
a
token
i
take
it
of
the
higher
evolution
of
the
human
an
audaciousness
which
dares
to
shake
off
the
blind
passion
and
evade
nature
trick
as
man
evaded
when
he
harnessed
steam
and
rested
his
feet
it
is
of
common
occurrence
that
a
man
and
woman
through
long
and
tried
friendship
reach
a
fine
appreciation
of
each
other
and
marry
and
the
run
of
such
marriages
is
the
happiest
neither
blinded
nor
frenzied
by
the
unreasoned
passion
of
love
they
have
weighed
each
other
faults
virtues
and
all
and
found
a
compatibility
strong
enough
to
withstand
the
strain
of
years
and
misfortune
and
wise
enough
to
compromise
the
individual
clashes
which
must
inevitably
arise
when
soul
shares
never
ending
bed
and
board
with
soul
they
have
achieved
before
marriage
what
the
man
and
woman
must
achieve
after
marriage
if
they
would
continue
to
live
together
that
is
they
have
sought
and
found
compatibility
before
binding
themselves
instead
of
binding
themselves
first
and
then
seeking
if
there
be
compatibility
or
not
let
me
apparently
digress
for
the
moment
and
bring
all
clear
and
straight
the
emotions
have
no
basis
in
reason
we
smile
or
are
sad
at
the
manifestation
of
jealousy
in
another
we
smile
or
are
sad
because
of
the
unreasonableness
of
it
likewise
we
smile
at
the
antics
of
the
lover
the
absurdities
he
is
guilty
of
the
capers
he
cuts
excite
our
philosophic
risibility
we
say
he
is
mad
as
a
march
hare
have
you
ever
wondered
dane
why
a
march
hare
is
deemed
mad
the
saying
is
a
pregnant
one
however
love
as
you
have
tacitly
agreed
is
unreasonable
in
fact
in
all
the
walks
of
animal
life
no
rational
sanction
can
be
found
for
the
of
the
individual
each
love
act
is
a
hazarding
of
the
individual
life
this
we
know
and
it
is
only
impelled
to
perform
such
acts
because
of
the
madness
of
the
trick
which
though
it
strikes
at
the
particular
life
makes
for
the
general
life
so
i
think
there
is
no
discussion
over
the
fact
that
this
emotion
of
love
has
no
basis
in
reason
as
the
old
french
proverb
runs
the
first
sigh
of
love
is
the
last
of
wisdom
on
the
other
hand
the
individual
not
yet
afflicted
by
love
or
recovered
from
it
conducts
his
life
in
a
rational
manner
every
act
he
performs
has
a
basis
in
reason
so
long
as
it
is
not
some
other
of
the
emotional
acts
the
stag
locking
horns
with
a
rival
over
the
possession
of
a
doe
is
highly
irrational
but
the
same
stag
hiding
its
trail
from
the
hounds
by
taking
to
water
is
performing
a
highly
rational
act
and
so
with
the
human
we
model
our
lives
on
a
basis
of
reason
of
the
best
reason
we
possess
we
do
not
put
the
scullery
in
the
nor
do
we
repair
our
bicycles
in
the
bedchamber
we
strive
not
to
exceed
our
income
and
we
deliberate
long
before
investing
our
savings
we
demand
good
recommendations
from
our
cook
and
take
letters
of
introduction
with
us
when
we
go
abroad
we
overlook
the
petulant
manner
of
our
friend
who
rowed
in
the
losing
barges
at
the
race
and
we
forgive
on
the
moment
the
sharp
answer
of
the
man
who
has
sat
three
nights
by
a
and
we
do
all
this
because
our
acts
have
a
basis
in
reason
comes
the
lover
tricked
by
nature
blind
of
passion
impelled
madly
toward
the
loved
one
he
is
as
blind
to
her
salient
imperfections
as
he
is
to
her
petty
vices
he
does
not
interrogate
her
disposition
and
temperament
or
speculate
as
to
how
they
will
coördinate
with
his
for
two
score
years
and
odd
he
questions
nothing
desires
nothing
save
to
possess
her
and
this
is
the
paradox
nature
he
is
driven
to
contract
a
temporary
tie
which
by
social
observance
and
demand
must
endure
for
a
too
much
stress
can
not
be
laid
upon
this
dane
for
herein
lies
the
secret
of
the
whole
difficulty
but
we
go
on
with
our
lover
in
the
throes
of
desire
for
desire
is
pain
whether
it
be
heart
hunger
or
belly
hunger
he
seeks
to
possess
the
loved
one
the
desire
is
a
pain
which
seeks
easement
through
possession
love
can
not
in
its
very
nature
be
peaceful
or
content
it
is
a
restlessness
an
unsatisfaction
i
can
grant
a
lasting
love
just
as
i
can
grant
a
lasting
satisfaction
but
the
lasting
love
can
not
be
coupled
with
possession
for
love
is
pain
and
desire
and
possession
is
easement
and
fulfilment
pursuit
and
possession
are
accompanied
by
states
of
consciousness
so
wide
apart
that
they
can
never
be
united
what
is
true
of
pursuit
can
not
be
true
of
possession
no
more
than
the
child
grasping
the
bright
ball
can
deem
it
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
the
world
an
appraisement
which
it
certainly
made
when
the
ball
was
beyond
reach
let
us
suppose
the
loved
one
is
as
madly
impelled
toward
the
lover
in
a
few
days
in
an
hour
nay
in
an
instant
for
there
is
such
a
thing
as
love
at
first
sight
this
man
and
woman
two
unrelated
individuals
who
may
never
have
seen
each
other
before
conceive
a
passion
greater
intenser
than
all
other
affections
friendships
and
social
relations
so
great
so
intense
is
it
that
the
world
could
crumble
to
so
long
as
their
souls
rushed
together
if
necessary
they
would
break
all
ties
forsake
all
friends
abandon
all
blood
kin
run
away
from
all
moral
responsibilities
there
can
be
no
discussion
dane
we
see
it
every
day
for
love
is
the
most
perfectly
selfish
thing
in
the
universe
but
this
is
easily
reconcilable
with
the
scheme
of
things
the
true
lover
is
the
child
of
nature
natural
selection
has
determined
that
exogamy
produces
fitter
progeny
than
endogamy
cross
fertilisation
has
made
stronger
individuals
and
types
and
likewise
it
has
maintained
them
on
the
other
hand
were
family
affection
stronger
than
love
there
would
be
much
intermarriage
of
blood
relations
and
a
consequent
weakening
of
the
breed
and
in
such
cases
it
would
be
stamped
out
by
the
exogamists
here
and
there
even
of
old
time
the
wise
men
recognised
it
and
we
so
recognise
it
as
witness
our
bars
against
consanguineous
marriage
but
be
not
misled
into
the
belief
that
love
is
finer
and
higher
than
affection
and
friendship
that
the
yielding
to
its
blandishments
is
higher
wisdom
on
the
part
of
our
lovers
not
so
they
are
puppets
and
know
and
think
nothing
about
it
they
come
of
those
who
yielded
likewise
in
the
past
they
obey
forces
beyond
them
greater
than
they
their
kind
and
all
life
great
as
the
great
forces
of
the
physical
universe
our
lovers
are
children
of
nature
natural
and
uninventive
duty
and
moral
responsibility
are
less
to
them
than
passion
they
will
obey
and
procreate
though
the
heavens
roll
up
as
a
scroll
and
all
things
come
to
judgment
and
they
are
right
if
this
is
what
we
understand
to
be
the
bloom
the
charm
the
smile
of
life
yet
man
is
man
because
he
chanced
to
develop
intelligence
instead
of
instinct
otherwise
he
would
to
this
day
have
remained
among
the
anthropoid
apes
he
has
turned
away
from
nature
become
unnatural
as
it
were
disliked
the
earth
upon
which
he
found
himself
and
changed
the
face
of
it
somewhat
to
his
liking
his
trend
has
been
and
still
is
to
perform
more
and
more
acts
with
a
rational
sanction
he
has
developed
a
moral
nature
made
laws
and
by
the
sheer
force
of
his
will
and
reason
curbed
his
lyings
and
his
lusts
however
our
lovers
are
natural
and
uninventive
they
get
married
pursuit
with
all
its
tantalus
delights
its
sighings
and
its
songs
is
gone
never
to
return
and
in
its
place
is
possession
which
is
satisfaction
familiarity
knowledge
it
heralds
the
return
of
rationality
the
return
to
duty
of
the
weighing
and
measuring
qualities
of
the
mind
our
lovers
discover
each
other
to
be
mere
man
and
woman
after
all
that
ethereal
substance
which
the
man
took
for
the
body
of
the
loved
one
becomes
flesh
and
blood
prone
to
the
common
weaknesses
and
ills
of
flesh
and
blood
he
on
the
other
hand
betrays
little
petulancies
of
disposition
little
faults
and
predispositions
of
which
she
never
dreamed
in
the
days
and
which
she
now
finds
eminently
distasteful
but
at
first
these
things
are
not
openly
unpleasant
there
are
no
scenes
one
or
the
other
gives
in
on
the
instant
without
and
one
or
the
other
retires
to
have
a
secret
cry
or
to
ruminate
about
it
over
a
cigar
the
first
faint
hints
i
may
slyly
suggest
of
the
return
of
rationality
are
beginning
to
ah
these
are
little
things
you
say
precisely
wherefore
i
lay
emphasis
upon
them
the
sum
of
the
innumerable
little
things
becomes
a
mighty
thing
to
test
the
human
soul
moreover
many
a
home
has
been
broken
because
of
disagreement
as
to
the
uses
or
abuses
of
couch
cushions
and
more
than
one
divorce
induced
by
the
lingering
of
tobacco
odours
in
the
curtains
if
the
marriage
of
our
lovers
conform
to
the
majority
of
marriages
the
first
year
of
their
wedded
life
will
determine
whether
they
are
able
to
share
bed
and
board
through
the
lengthening
years
for
this
first
year
often
the
first
months
of
it
marks
the
transition
from
love
to
conjugal
affection
or
witnesses
a
rupture
which
nothing
less
than
omnipotence
can
ever
mend
in
the
first
year
a
serious
readjustment
must
take
place
unreason
as
a
basis
for
the
relation
must
give
way
to
reason
blind
ignorant
selfish
little
love
must
flutter
away
so
that
friendship
and
wise
may
step
in
there
will
come
moments
when
wills
clash
and
desires
do
not
chime
these
must
be
moments
of
sober
thought
and
compromise
when
one
or
the
other
sacrifices
self
on
the
altar
of
their
nascent
friendship
upon
this
ability
to
compromise
depends
their
married
happiness
returning
to
the
rationality
which
they
forsook
during
they
can
not
live
a
joint
rational
existence
without
compromising
if
they
be
compatible
they
will
gradually
grow
to
fit
each
with
the
other
into
the
common
life
compromise
on
certain
definite
points
will
become
automatic
and
for
the
rest
they
will
exhibit
a
tacit
and
reasoned
recognition
of
the
imperfections
and
frailties
of
life
all
this
reason
will
dictate
if
they
be
incapable
of
rising
to
compromise
sacrifice
and
unselfishness
reason
will
dictate
separation
in
such
cases
when
they
will
have
become
rational
once
more
they
will
reason
the
impossibility
of
a
continued
relation
and
give
it
up
in
which
case
the
disciple
may
contend
that
there
was
no
real
love
in
the
beginning
but
he
is
wrong
it
was
just
as
real
as
that
of
any
marriage
only
it
failed
in
the
quest
after
compatibility
in
all
marriages
love
passionate
romantic
love
must
disappear
to
be
replaced
by
conjugal
affection
or
by
nothing
the
former
are
the
happy
marriages
the
latter
the
mistaken
ones
as
i
close
the
saying
of
la
bruyère
comes
to
me
the
love
which
arises
suddenly
takes
longest
to
cure
this
generalisation
upon
all
the
within
the
scope
of
a
single
lifetime
can
not
but
be
true
and
it
is
quite
in
line
with
the
general
argument
i
have
shown
that
the
love
so
called
which
grows
slowly
is
akin
to
friendship
that
it
is
friendship
in
fact
conjugal
friendship
on
the
other
hand
the
more
sudden
a
love
the
more
intense
it
must
be
also
the
less
rationality
can
it
have
and
because
of
its
intensity
and
unreasonableness
the
longer
period
must
elapse
ere
its
frenzy
dies
out
and
cool
calm
thought
comes
in
herbert
my
book
is
out
the
economic
man
i
send
it
to
you
i
can
not
imagine
you
will
care
for
the
thing
xxi
from
the
same
to
the
same
the
ridge

may
pretty
louisa
naveret
because
her
fiancé
charles
johnson
could
not
understand
a
joke
is
dying
with
a
bullet
in
her
brain
and
he
her
murderer
lies
dead
at
the
morgue
they
were
to
have
been
married
from
paper
i
quote
the
above
introduction
to
a
column
in
simple
life
simple
it
was
and
elemental
the
man
loving
steadily
and
doggedly
and
madly
after
the
manner
of
the
male
before
possession
the
woman
fluttering
and
teasing
and
tantalising
after
the
manner
of
the
female
courting
possession
they
had
been
engaged
for
some
time
the
woman
loved
the
man
and
fully
intended
to
marry
him
the
engagement
neared
its
close
and
on
the
day
before
that
of
the
wedding
the
man
slow
minded
loving
intensely
procured
the
marriage
licence
the
woman
read
the
document
and
with
the
last
coy
flutter
before
surrender
told
him
that
she
would
not
marry
him
i
meant
it
as
a
jest
she
said
as
she
lay
on
a
cot
at
the
receiving
hospital
but
four
bullets
were
in
her
body
and
charles
johnson
clumsy
and
natural
lover
lay
dead
in
an
adjoining
room
with
the
fifth
bullet
in
his
brain
in
this
pitiful
little
tragedy
appear
two
of
the
most
salient
characteristics
of
love
namely
madness
and
selfishness
let
us
analyze
charles
johnson
condition
he
was
a
lineman
for
a
telegraph
company
healthy
and
strong
used
to
life
and
hard
work
he
had
steady
employment
and
good
wages
ca
you
see
the
man
content
with
a
good
digestion
unailing
body
and
mild
pleasures
and
enjoying
life
with
bovine
placidity
but
pretty
louisa
naveret
entered
his
life
the
abysmal
fecundity
was
stirred
and
life
clamoured
to
be
created
peacefulness
and
content
vanished
all
the
forces
of
his
existence
impelled
him
to
seize
upon
and
possess
louisa
naveret
he
was
afflicted
with
a
disorder
of
mind
and
body
a
madness
so
great
a
delusion
so
powerful
a
pain
and
unrest
so
pressing
that
the
possession
of
that
particular
woman
became
the
dearest
thing
in
the
world
dearer
than
life
itself
and
more
potent
than
the
will
to
live
i
do
well
to
call
love
a
madness
any
departure
from
rationality
is
madness
and
for
a
man
of
charles
johnson
calibre
suicide
is
an
extremely
irrational
act
but
he
also
killed
louisa
naveret
wherein
he
was
as
selfish
as
he
was
mad
convinced
that
he
was
not
to
possess
her
he
was
determined
that
no
other
man
should
possess
her
while
on
this
matter
of
love
considered
as
a
disorder
of
mind
and
body
i
recall
a
recent
magazine
article
of
finck
in
which
he
analyzes
sappho
conception
of
love
in
that
famous
poem
of
sappho
he
says
that
has
been
so
often
declared
a
compendium
of
all
the
emotions
that
make
up
love
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
anything
but
a
comic
catalogue
of
such
feelings
as
might
overwhelm
a
woman
if
she
met
a
bear
in
the
woods
pallor
cold
sweat
fluttering
heart
paralyzed
all
over
fainting
fit
dante
suffered
similarly
from
the
disorder
of
love
if
you
will
recollect
in
this
connection
may
be
cited
the
following
passage
from
diderot
paradox
of
acting
take
two
lovers
both
of
whom
have
their
declarations
to
make
who
will
come
out
of
it
best
not
i
i
promise
you
i
remember
that
i
approached
the
beloved
object
with
fear
and
trembling
my
heart
beat
my
ideas
grew
confused
my
voice
failed
me
i
mangled
all
i
said
i
cried
for
i
made
a
thousand
blunders
i
was
illimitably
inept
i
was
absurd
from
top
to
toe
and
the
more
i
saw
it
the
more
absurd
i
became
meanwhile
under
my
very
eyes
a
gay
rival
light
hearted
and
agreeable
master
of
himself
pleased
with
himself
losing
no
opportunity
for
the
finest
flattery
made
himself
entertaining
and
agreeable
enjoyed
himself
he
implored
the
touch
of
a
hand
which
was
at
once
given
him
he
sometimes
caught
it
without
asking
leave
he
kissed
it
once
and
again
i
the
while
alone
in
a
corner
avoided
a
sight
which
irritated
me
stifling
my
sighs
cracking
my
fingers
with
grasping
my
wrists
plunged
in
melancholy
covered
with
a
cold
sweat
i
could
neither
show
nor
conceal
my
vexation
oh
the
clamour
of
life
to
be
born
is
a
masterful
thing
and
so
far
as
the
individual
is
concerned
a
most
irrational
thing
and
so
far
as
the
world
of
beasts
and
emotional
men
and
women
is
concerned
it
is
a
most
necessary
thing
that
life
may
live
and
continue
to
live
a
driving
force
is
needed
that
is
greater
than
the
puny
will
of
life
and
in
the
disorder
produced
by
the
passion
for
perpetuation
whether
or
not
assisted
by
imagination
is
found
this
driving
force
as
ernest
haeckel
that
brave
old
hero
of
jena
explains
the
irresistible
passion
that
draws
edward
to
the
sympathetic
otillia
or
paris
to
helen
and
leaps
all
bounds
of
reason
and
morality
is
the
same
attractive
force
which
impels
the
living
spermatozoon
to
force
an
entrance
into
the
ovum
in
the
fertilisation
of
the
egg
of
the
animal
or
plant
the
same
impetuous
movement
which
unites
two
atoms
of
hydrogen
to
one
atom
of
oxygen
for
the
formation
of
a
molecule
of
water
but
with
the
advent
of
intellectual
man
there
is
no
longer
need
for
obeying
blind
and
irresistible
compulsion
intellectual
man
changing
the
face
of
life
with
his
inventions
and
artifices
performing
telic
actions
adjusting
himself
and
his
concerns
to
remote
ends
and
ultimate
compensations
will
grapple
with
the
problem
of
perpetuation
as
he
has
grappled
with
that
of
gravitation
as
he
controls
and
directs
the
great
natural
forces
so
that
instead
of
menacing
they
are
made
to
labour
for
his
safety
and
comfort
so
will
he
control
and
direct
the
operation
of
the
reproductive
force
so
that
life
will
not
only
be
perpetuated
but
developed
and
made
higher
and
finer
this
is
not
more
impossible
than
is
the
impossible
or
democracy
impossible

june
please
remember
that
these
letters
are
written
to
you
alone
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
less
love
in
the
world
than
ever
before
i
make
you
representative
of
a
class
which
in
turn
is
characteristic
of
the
modern
scientific
type
but
i
do
not
make
you
representative
of
all
that
world
has
lived
up
to
and
lived
down
so
i
do
not
join
my
ruskin
in
lamenting
the
past
to
be
sure
you
are
contemporary
and
you
are
parvenu
what
then
you
are
few
nevertheless
and
like
the
parvenu
rich
you
must
pass
into
something
quite
unlike
yourself
it
is
the
law
of
growth
i
ask
you
to
account
for
yourself
as
an
individual
the
thing
is
fiercely
personal
but
you
choose
the
roundabout
method
of
answering
me
for
a
view
of
what
in
your
eyes
is
pertinent
to
this
matter
you
stretch
a
canvas
wide
as
the
world
you
are
resolved
that
your
course
should
dramatise
the
whole
play
and
interplay
of
force
and
matter
it
is
ideally
ambitious
of
you
and
i
am
glad
it
puts
you
in
the
ranks
with
the
students
of
the
ideal
tendencies
it
shows
that
you
are
not
always
impatient
for
short
cuts
and
that
you
begin
to
be
of
those
who
harness
horses
of
the
sun
to
plough
in
earth
rough
furrows
your
letter
sounds
conclusive
romance
is
waste
love
is
unreasoning
compatibility
alone
is
worth
while
you
think
this
and
are
ready
to
encrust
yourself
with
what
is
conventional
and
practical
ah
no
it
is
not
even
decently
conventional
the
formal
world
pretends
at
least
to
love
it
also
reaches
for
the
fires
that
thrill
and
thaw
whereas
you
stand
before
a
cold
hearth
and
think
the
chill
well
and
welcome
since
you
understand
its
cause
you
have
grasped
part
of
a
truth
and
though
my
mind
complete
your
arc
into
the
perfection
of
a
circle
i
can
not
place
it
about
your
head
as
a
halo
my
confusion
comes
from
thinking
of
you
more
than
of
my
creed
a
pregnant
factor
in
our
debate
is
the
debater
the
hafiz
of
the
hafiz
maxims
the
philosopher
of
your
philosophy
happens
to
interest
me
you
have
been
building
yourself
up
before
my
eyes
and
for
watching
i
can
not
speak
with
what
does
romance
interfere
if
it
implied
a
waste
of
vital
force
a
giving
up
a
postponement
of
life
it
were
a
roundabout
path
to
development
and
happiness
but
we
live
most
when
we
are
most
under
its
sway
and
it
is
for
such
sparks
that
we
live
at
all
romance
quickens
and
controls
as
does
nothing
else
and
because
of
this
it
is
not
only
a
means
but
an
end
in
itself
it
is
life
we
live
most
when
we
love
most
the
love
of
romance
and
the
romance
of
love
is
the
only
coin
for
which
the
sell
their
death
a
trick
perhaps
the
love
of
life
is
a
trick
to
save
the
races
from
nature
makes
legitimate
her
tricks
let
the
genius
of
the
race
lure
us
with
passion
and
dreaming
we
are
not
the
losers
by
it
and
if
the
dream
fades
and
we
grow
gray
despite
what
has
been
lived
then
it
is
something
to
remember
that
soul
and
sense
have
leapt
and
pulsed
i
am
thankful
that
romance
has
an
aftermath
and
that
old
men
and
women
can
prattle
about
days
that
were
robust
i
am
thankful
that
the
soldiers
of
life
are
at
the
end
given
a
furlough
in
which
to
fondle
the
arms
they
wielded
with
clumsiness
and
with
spirit
and
in
which
to
pass
themselves
in
review
before
their
pension
expires
and
their
days
are
over
youth
has
the
romance
of
loving
and
age
the
romance
of
remembering
lovers
are
not
always
compatible
you
say
and
before
all
you
insist
upon
good
partnership
how
will
you
insure
yourself
against
unfitness
surely
not
by
a
registering
and
weighing
of
qualities
not
by
bargaining
and
speculating
we
do
not
choose
our
wives
as
we
do
our
we
do
not
plan
our
marriages
as
we
plan
our
houses
it
may
sound
paradoxical
but
there
is
a
higher
compatibility
than
that
of
quality
and
degree
it
is
not
whether
people
can
live
together
but
whether
they
should
live
together
it
is
an
awkward
thing
to
play
with
souls
you
override
the
fastidiousness
of
the
soul
in
marrying
your
companion
unless
you
are
an
automaton
you
can
not
rest
happy
in
the
fact
that
you
and
she
do
not
disagree
for
comfort
sake
you
would
have
a
negative
dimension
to
your
cosmos
forgetting
that
your
longings
and
your
needs
and
it
may
be
your
dreams
are
positive
if
and
affection
were
not
as
accidental
and
as
dependent
on
mood
as
love
itself
your
position
would
have
much
in
its
favour
you
could
then
arrange
for
compatibility
in
marriage
you
speak
of
the
methods
in
economics
that
conserve
energy
and
capital
such
as
the
employ
of
the
boy
which
saves
the
labour
power
of
a
hundred
men
and
you
hold
that
in
the
realm
of
personal
life
like
methods
may
obtain
with
value
and
dignity
i
can
see
how
natural
it
has
become
for
you
to
take
this
viewpoint
one
can
be
a
zealot
in
matters
frigid
the
law
behind
the
fact
has
you
in
its
coil
and
your
passion
goes
to
ice
you
burn
for
that
cold
thing
compatibility
you
too
are
in
the
bound
to
a
stake
it
is
not
for
such
as
you
to
escape
the
fire
if
you
look
to
compatibility
and
want
it
intensely
as
others
want
love
then
you
suffer
and
from
your
standpoint
not
mine
you
raise
a
vain
cry
for
compatibility
like
everything
else
is
illusory
the
illusions
of
love
are
a
strength
and
the
ways
of
love
are
divine
through
them
we
come
to
that
feeling
of
completion
which
is
compatibility
and
which
is
as
ineffable
as
the
promise
of
waves
heard
by
those
who
have
also
listened
to
weeping
love
is
not
responsible
for
institutionalism
there
would
be
no
fewer
marriages
if
people
married
for
convenience
nor
would
the
law
make
such
unions
less
binding
it
is
not
the
fault
of
love
that
the
great
social
paradox
exists
in
the
precipitancy
of
feeling
you
say
the
lover
fastens
upon
an
unsuitable
mate
and
with
possession
love
dies
here
i
attack
your
facts
if
an
awakening
comes
it
is
not
for
either
of
these
reasons
love
is
not
essentially
rational
but
then
it
is
love
there
is
some
consistency
in
affairs
natural
and
the
esoteric
draught
that
enchanted
at
one
time
can
not
poison
at
another
love
is
not
essentially
rational
and
it
will
not
of
a
sudden
become
so
at
the
possession
of
the
loved
one
people
who
marry
from
convenience
may
wake
to
find
their
union
most
inconvenient
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
and
there
are
more
intricacies
of
feeling
and
more
sloughs
and
depths
than
are
dreamed
of
in
your
philosophy
a
definite
understanding
as
to
sofa
cushions
and
tobacco
smoke
does
not
always
insure
unwearied
forbearance
and
devotion
with
love
on
the
other
hand
disappointment
is
very
much
less
likely
to
spring
up
for
the
reason
that
it
is
free
from
calculation
love
is
a
sympathy
it
takes
hold
it
grows
upon
the
soul
and
the
senses
and
it
does
not
flee
before
argument
and
explanation
still
less
can
i
admit
that
possession
kills
love
do
we
give
up
living
because
the
world
is
based
on
will
and
idea
yet
to
will
is
to
want
schopenhauer
tells
us
and
to
want
is
to
be
in
pain
do
we
know
ourselves
in
pain
every
minute
of
our
lives
hardly
this
applies
you
hold
that
with
the
fulfilled
hope
and
the
appeased
hunger
indifference
takes
the
place
of
desire
it
reads
so
in
logic
but
not
in
life
if
what
is
in
our
possession
be
good
we
prize
it
more
highly
for
its
being
within
reach
the
good
in
our
keeping
does
not
sate
it
pains
with
divine
hungers
we
do
not
tire
of
what
we
have
we
rise
to
it
we
do
not
know
the
sweetness
of
being
steadfast
until
we
are
so
impelled
by
the
love
with
which
we
have
grown
great
the
lover
may
well
say
she
was
not
my
ideal
before
i
knew
her
i
was
not
great
enough
to
think
her
she
taught
me
besides
an
acquaintance
with
your
wife
faults
does
not
kill
your
love
you
can
not
turn
from
your
brother
or
your
friend
if
he
commit
even
a
lurid
act
you
can
not
turn
from
a
stranger
much
less
can
you
turn
from
your
beloved
herbert
when
men
set
themselves
to
judge
they
are
invariably
ridiculous
and
an
offence
to
high
heaven
believe
me
it
is
artificial
the
true
judge
cares
not
for
the
fact
of
the
deed
but
for
its
motive
and
the
lover
knows
the
motive
he
has
the
key
to
the
life
he
knows
his
beloved
not
as
she
is
but
as
she
was
born
to
be
his
lips
press
and
his
arms
enfold
not
her
so
much
as
the
ideal
of
her
and
unless
she
unmake
herself
he
can
not
unlove
her
to
judge
a
man
by
the
fruit
of
his
actions
says
professor
edward
howard
griggs
it
is
necessary
to
know
all
of
the
fruit
which
is
impossible
you
can
only
know
what
he
eternally
must
be
if
you
catch
the
aspect
of
his
soul
and
grow
to
understand
his
aspirations
and
his
loves
to
idealise
therefore
is
not
to
be
blind
but
to
be
there
is
another
way
of
looking
on
this
question
of
the
paradox
granted
that
it
is
caused
by
romantic
love
romantic
love
is
still
exclusively
the
best
thing
in
the
world
you
can
not
pay
too
dearly
for
the
good
of
life
i
know
that
the
misery
of
being
in
the
intimacy
of
wedlock
with
one
who
is
not
loved
is
unutterable
it
is
to
become
degraded
and
unrecognisable
it
is
to
wear
the
brand
of
liar
before
god
the
man
whose
outer
life
belies
the
inner
is
an
enforced
suicide
there
is
something
of
majesty
on
laying
one
self
down
with
a
will
and
there
is
something
of
strength
in
cloistering
the
body
for
the
health
sake
but
to
die
when
all
within
is
warm
and
clamorous
for
life
is
terrible
such
a
death
they
die
who
are
held
together
not
by
the
bonds
of
the
spirit
but
by
those
of
convention
they
who
would
go
from
each
other
and
dare
not
die
the
ignominious
death
of
fear
the
suicide
is
contemptible
besides
being
pitiable
when
he
is
hounded
out
of
life
despite
himself
when
he
is
a
little
embezzler
of
a
clerk
who
rushes
from
the
music
hall
to
the
thames
and
thinks
of
the
unfinished
glass
with
his
last
breath
no
i
do
not
underestimate
the
tragedy
of
the
paradox
yet
i
say
that
if
love
were
accountable
for
it
which
it
is
not
it
would
still
be
folly
to
forswear
love
do
you
ask
why
because
its
dangers
are
the
dangers
common
to
all
life
and
we
are
so
made
that
we
can
not
be
frightened
away
from
our
portion
of
experience
we
are
as
loth
to
give
up
our
nights
as
our
days
the
winters
as
the
summers
all
the
seasons
and
all
the
climes
the
fears
as
the
hopes
all
the
travail
of
deepest
fullest
living
we
claim
as
our
own
forever
we
guard
jealously
our
heritage
of
feeling
would
you
for
all
the
world
sleep
rather
than
wake
forget
rather
than
remember
then
cease
the
requiem
of
your
speech
about
the
dangers
of
disillusion
madness
and
selfishness
were
the
cause
of
louisa
naveret
death
and
the
man
who
was
mad
and
selfish
was
her
lover
the
poor
man
had
not
the
strength
to
renounce
when
he
thought
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
necessity
of
renouncing
but
all
lovers
are
not
too
weak
to
cope
with
love
john
ruskin
if
you
remember
loved
his
wife
and
he
shot
neither
himself
nor
her
nor
millais
charles
johnson
is
not
a
ruskin
and
ruskin
love
was
not
a
madness
and
herbert
to
me
there
is
nothing
comic
in
a
stress
of
feeling
let
the
lover
pale
and
flutter
and
faint
in
the
presence
of
his
deity
it
is
an
acceptable
form
of
worship
the
very
lover
is
more
preposterous
your
book
has
not
yet
reached
me
i
shall
write
again
providing
i
remember
how
to
write
a
natural
letter
yours
dane
kempton
xxiii
from
the
same
to
the
same
london
june
there
are
impersonal
hours
when
the
things
of
the
day
drop
below
consciousness
and
the
spirit
grows
devotional
and
wends
a
pilgrimage
to
larger
spheres
there
to
sit
apart
such
a
respite
was
mine
there
had
been
a
call
to
rouse
and
put
forth
work
and
i
wrought
with
all
the
puniness
of
my
might
woe
is
me
and
earned
my
post
at
the
window
that
looks
out
upon
the
large
things
the
best
of
nights
and
days
of
toil
is
that
there
comes
a
twilight
in
which
fatigued
eyes
see
clear
i
said
it
did
not
matter
how
you
do
about
your
marriage
time
may
right
you
in
a
way
i
can
not
know
i
said
it
did
not
matter
if
you
are
not
righted
in
this
there
being
so
much
that
never
rights
itself
both
hope
and
despair
were
followed
by
a
calm
of
neutrality
the
inquiry
waited
no
solution
the
stress
no
longer
touched
me
and
my
twilight
became
luminous
i
saw
things
as
from
a
height
and
forms
dropped
out
of
my
range
when
barbara
came
tugging
at
me
and
my
pale
while
of
abstraction
was
at
an
end
she
wanted
to
know
what
troubled
me
she
made
her
way
to
me
hurried
but
resolved
and
stated
her
demand
you
catechised
me
yesterday
you
shall
answer
she
had
come
to
defend
herself
my
talk
having
of
late
taken
on
the
sameness
of
that
of
the
man
of
one
idea
barbara
was
aroused
i
was
gauging
her
because
she
distressed
me
was
her
thought
i
had
been
trying
to
find
whether
it
is
possible
to
live
differently
from
her
and
live
happily
and
well
you
think
i
am
not
close
enough
to
earl
because
i
mourn
for
my
little
one
perhaps
you
think
me
not
sufficiently
happy
to
be
wifely
could
i
suppose
aught
else
from
such
an
utterance
but
that
there
was
an
estrangement
and
hidden
pain
how
unless
there
were
sorrow
could
the
woman
see
herself
sorrowed
for
my
mind
leapt
to
possibilities
little
barbara
on
the
rack
was
more
than
i
could
bear
i
groped
for
her
hands
it
was
a
fault
in
her
to
be
so
much
on
her
guard
she
had
no
sorrow
to
confess
and
spoke
only
to
ward
off
what
was
not
directed
toward
her
the
tenour
of
your
talk
led
me
on
to
believe
she
stammered
with
hot
cheeks
it
is
a
standing
offence
of
hers
to
imagine
herself
accused
and
she
admits
it
is
a
weakness
born
of
lack
of
poise
but
i
took
all
for
granted
i
thought
you
fortunate
beyond
any
other
woman
i
protested
at
this
the
radiance
broke
forth
i
forgave
the
chill
that
her
first
words
on
entering
the
room
struck
to
my
heart
and
she
forgot
what
she
had
imagined
there
is
nothing
more
important
than
the
play
and
interplay
of
feeling
were
barbara
unwifely
i
could
not
blame
her
but
neither
could
i
have
at
hand
my
proof
of
dear
miracles
my
proof
remained
to
me
for
there
she
stood
her
face
lifted
toward
mine
her
mouth
tremulous
her
grey
eyes
swimming
the
mate
woman
was
stirred
barbara
is
and
has
been
married
seven
years
and
she
still
vibrates
with
the
old
wonder
to
find
herself
loving
and
beloved
i
meant
to
tell
you
of
what
we
spoke
later
in
the
hope
that
i
could
show
you
a
little
better
what
i
hold
dear
and
why
but
my
hand
grows
nerveless
the
twilight
of
abstraction
has
set
in
a
little
while
ago
this
hand
was
quick
to
rest
on
barbara
as
i
called
her
my
heroine
she
is
that
not
alone
because
she
is
pure
and
good
and
strong
but
because
she
can
accept
the
test
of
her
instincts
it
takes
both
faith
and
strength
to
obey
oneself
when
shows
break
up
what
but
one
self
remains
asks
whitman
the
shows
are
but
shows
for
barbara
will
i
look
into
your
eyes
on
the
morrow
and
find
them
like
hers
clear
grant
that
it
be
dane
xxiv
from
herbert
wace
to
dane
kempton
the
ridge
berkeley
california
july
somewhere
in
ward
you
may
read
it
must
constantly
be
borne
in
mind
that
all
progress
consists
in
the
arbitrary
alteration
by
human
efforts
and
devices
of
the
normal
course
of
nature
so
that
civilisation
is
wholly
an
artificial
product
why
dane
this
is
large
enough
to
base
a
sociology
upon
and
i
must
ask
you
first
is
it
true
second
do
you
understand
do
you
appreciate
the
tremendous
significance
of
it
and
third
how
can
you
bring
your
philosophy
of
love
in
accord
with
it
romantic
love
is
certainly
not
natural
it
is
an
artifice
blunderingly
and
unwittingly
introduced
by
man
into
the
natural
order
is
this
audacious
let
us
see
in
a
state
of
nature
the
love
which
obtains
is
merely
the
passion
for
perpetuation
devoid
of
all
imagination
the
male
possesses
the
prehensile
organs
and
the
superior
strength
beyond
the
ardour
of
pursuit
the
female
has
no
charms
for
him
but
he
is
driven
irresistibly
to
pursuit
and
by
virtue
of
his
prehensile
organs
and
superior
strength
he
ravishes
the
females
of
his
species
and
goes
his
way
but
life
creeps
slowly
upward
increasing
in
complexity
and
necessarily
in
intelligence
when
some
forgotten
inventor
of
the
older
world
smote
his
rival
or
enemy
with
a
branch
of
wood
and
found
that
it
was
good
and
thereafter
made
a
practice
of
smiting
rivals
and
enemies
with
branches
of
wood
then
and
on
that
day
artificiality
may
be
said
to
have
begun
then
and
on
that
day
was
begun
a
revolution
destined
to
change
the
history
of
life
then
and
on
that
day
was
laid
the
cornerstone
of
that
most
tremendous
of
artifices
civilisation
trace
it
up
our
and
arboreal
ancestors
entered
upon
the
first
of
many
short
cuts
to
crack
a
with
a
rock
was
the
act
which
fathered
the
tool
and
between
the
cracking
of
a
and
the
riding
down
town
in
an
automobile
lies
only
a
difference
of
degree
the
one
is
crudely
artificial
the
other
consummately
artificial
that
is
all
there
have
been
improvements
the
first
inventors
grasped
that
truthful
paradox
the
longest
way
round
is
the
shortest
way
home
and
forsook
the
direct
pursuit
of
happiness
for
the
indirect
pursuit
of
happiness
if
the
happiness
of
a
savage
depended
upon
his
crossing
an
extensive
body
of
water
he
did
not
directly
proceed
to
swim
it
but
turned
his
back
upon
it
selected
a
tree
from
the
forest
shaped
it
with
his
rude
tools
and
hollowed
it
out
with
fire
then
launched
it
in
the
water
and
paddled
toward
where
his
happiness
lay
now
concerning
love
in
the
state
of
nature
it
is
a
brutal
passion
nothing
more
there
is
no
romance
attached
but
life
creeps
upward
and
the
gregarious
human
forms
social
groups
the
like
of
which
never
existed
before
consider
the
family
group
for
instance
such
a
group
becomes
in
itself
an
entity
by
means
of
the
group
man
is
better
enabled
to
pursue
happiness
but
to
maintain
the
group
it
must
be
regulated
so
man
formulates
rules
codes
dim
ethical
laws
for
the
conduct
of
the
group
members
sexual
ties
are
made
less
promiscuous
and
more
orderly
a
greater
privacy
is
observed
and
out
of
order
and
privacy
spring
respect
and
sacredness
but
life
creeps
upward
and
the
family
group
itself
becomes
but
a
unit
of
greater
and
greater
groups
and
rules
and
codes
change
in
accordance
until
the
marriage
tie
becomes
possessed
of
a
history
and
takes
to
itself
traditions
this
history
and
these
traditions
form
a
great
fund
to
which
changing
conditions
and
growing
imagination
constantly
add
and
the
traditions
more
especially
bear
heavily
upon
the
individual
overmastering
his
natural
expression
of
the
love
instinct
and
forcing
him
to
an
artificial
expression
of
that
love
instinct
he
loves
not
as
his
savage
forebears
loved
but
as
his
group
loves
and
the
love
method
of
his
group
is
determined
by
its
love
traditions
does
the
individual
compare
his
beloved
eyes
to
the
stars
it
is
a
trick
of
old
time
which
has
come
down
to
him
does
he
serenade
under
her
window
or
compose
an
ode
to
her
beauty
or
virtue
his
father
did
it
before
him
in
his
lover
voice
throb
the
voices
of
myriads
of
lovers
all
dead
and
dust
the
singers
of
a
thousand
songs
are
the
ghostly
chorus
to
the
song
of
love
he
sings
his
ideas
his
very
feelings
are
not
his
but
the
ideas
and
feelings
of
countless
lovers
who
lived
and
loved
and
whose
lives
and
loves
are
remembered
their
mistaken
facts
and
foolish
precepts
are
his
and
likewise
their
imaginative
absurdities
and
sentimental
philanderings
without
an
erotic
literature
a
history
of
great
loves
and
lovers
a
garland
of
love
songs
and
ballads
a
sheaf
of
spoken
love
tales
and
adventures
without
all
this
which
is
the
property
of
his
group
he
could
not
possibly
love
in
the
way
he
does
to
illustrate
isolate
a
boy
babe
and
a
girl
babe
of
cultured
breed
upon
a
desert
isle
let
them
feed
and
grow
strong
on
and
fruit
but
let
them
see
none
other
of
their
species
hear
no
speech

then
they

generations
out
of
which

descended
would
fail
to
prevent
polygamy
did
another
woman
chance
to
strand
on
that
particular
isle
it
is
the
common
practice
of
the
man
of
the
london
slum
to
kick
his
wife
to
death
when
she
has
offended
him
and
the
man
of
the
london
slum
is
a
very
natural
beast
who
expresses
himself
in
a
very
natural
manner
he
has
never
heard
of
hero
and
leander
and
the
comparison
of
the
eyes
to
the
stars
would
to
him
be
arrant
bosh
the
gentle
tender
considerate
male
is
an
artificial
product
and
so
is
the
romantic
lover
who
is
fashioned
by
the
love
traditions
which
come
down
to
him
and
by
the
erotic
literature
to
which
he
has
access
and
now
to
the
point
romantic
love
being
an
artificial
product
you
can
not
base
its
retention
upon
the
claim
that
it
is
natural
your
only
claim
can
be
that
it
is
the
best
possible
artifice
for
the
perpetuation
of
life
or
that
it
is
the
only
perfect
and
artifice
that
man
can
devise
on
the
one
hand
for
the
perpetuation
of
life
man
demonstrates
the
inefficiency
of
romantic
love
by
his
achievements
in
the
domestic
selection
of
animals
and
on
the
other
hand
the
very
irrationality
of
romantic
love
will
tend
to
its
gradual
elimination
as
the
human
grows
wiser
and
wiser
also
because
it
is
such
a
crude
artifice
it
forces
far
too
many
to
contract
the
permanent
marriage
tie
without
possessing
compatibility
during
the
time
romantic
love
runs
its
course
in
an
individual
that
individual
is
in
a
diseased
abnormal
irrational
condition
mental
or
spiritual
health
which
is
rationality
makes
for
progress
and
the
future
demands
greater
and
greater
mental
or
spiritual
health
greater
and
greater
rationality
the
brain
must
dominate
and
direct
both
the
individual
and
society
in
the
time
to
come
not
the
belly
and
the
heart
granted
that
the
function
romantic
love
has
served
has
been
necessary
that
is
no
reason
to
conclude
that
it
must
always
be
necessary
that
it
is
eternally
necessary
there
is
such
a
thing
as
rudimentary

are
no

the

of

the

triumphing

while
our

delights
themselves

their
very
refinement
has
been
due

the

our

the

take
it
that
the

is
that
portion
of

which
is
more
dominated
by

than
the

proper
and
i
as
a

of
that
group
propose
to
order
my
affairs
in

manner
my
reason
tells
me
that
the

passion
of
begetting
and
the
paltry
romance
of
pursuit
are
not
the
greatest
and
most
exquisite
delights
of
living
intellectual
delight
is
my
bribe
for
living
and
though
the
bargain
be
a
hard
one
i
shall
endeavour
to
exact
the
last
shekel
which
is
my
due
wherefore
i
marry

i
am
not
impelled
by
the
archaic
sex
madness
of

nor
by

obsolescent

of

i
contract
a
tie
which
my

tells
me
is

upon

my

my

shall

no

do
i
ask

oh
how
many
good
men

have
i
heard
bitterly
arraign
society
in
that
in
the
begetting
of
children
it
does
not
exercise
the
judgment
which
it
exercises
in
breeding
its
horses
and
its

marriage
is
something
more
than
the
mere
pulsating
to
romance
the
thrilling
to

the
singing
idly
in

the
sating

let
us
continue

society
continues
to
breed
its
horses

with
judgment
and

and
to
trust
to
luck
for
its

but
it
wo

life
in

all
that

dickered

love
is
life
you
say
and
you
seem
to
hold
it
the
achievement
of

but
i
can
not

that
life
is
love
life
it
is
a
toy

given
to

we
know
not
why
to
play
with
as
we
chance
to

some
elect

some
to
love
and
some
to
fight
some
choose
immediate
happiness
and
some
ultimate
happiness
one
stakes
the
here
and
now
upon
the

another
takes
the
here

and
lets
the

go
but
each
grasps
the
toy
and
does
with
it
according
to
his
fancy
and
while
none
may
know
the
end
of
life
all
know
that
life
is
the
end
of
love
love
poor
little
crude
little
love
is
the
means
to
life
and
so
we
complete

life
it
is
a
toy
i
faith
given
us
we
know

why
to
play
with
as
we

but
this
we
know
that
love
is
the
means
to
life
and
it
is
subject
to
inevitable
improvement
by
our

will
we
improve
upon
it

when

abundant
you
say
an
acquaintance
with
the
petty
vices
of
one
wife
does
not
kill
one
love
oh
yes
it
does
and
out
of
the
ashes
of
that
love
rises
affection
comradeship
in
kind
somewhat
similar
to
the
affection
and
comradeship
which
i
have
for
my
brother
i
do
not
my
brother
and
it
is
because
i
do
not
love
him
and
because
i
do
have
and
for
him
that
i
do
not
turn
away
when
he
commits
even
a
lurid
act
love
you
will
remember
takes
its
rise
in
the
emotions
and
is
unstable
and
wanton
and
capricious
but
affection
takes
its
rise
in
the
intellect
is
based
upon
judgment
of
the
brain
love
is
unyielding
tyranny
affection
is
compromise
love
never
compromises
no
more
than
does
the
mad
little
mating
sparrow
compromise
my
brother
i
played
with
him
as
a
boy
his
weaknesses
and
faults
incensed
and
hurt
me
as
mine
incensed
and
hurt
him
many
were
our
quarrels
but
he
had
also
good
qualities
which
pleased
me
and
at
times
performed
gracious
acts
and
even
sacrifices
and
i
likewise
and
with
my
brain
i
weighed
his
weaknesses
and
faults
against
his
gracious
acts
and
sacrifices
and
i
achieved
a
judgment
upon
him
the
ethics
of
the
family
group
also
contributed
to
this
judgment
the
duties
of
kinship
and
the
responsibilities
of
blood
ties
were
impressed
upon
me
we
grew
up
at
our
mother
knee
and
she
and
our
father
became
factors
in
determining
what
my
conduct
should
be
they
too
taught
me
that
my
brother
was
my
brother
and
that
in
so
far
as
he
was
my
brother
my
relations
with
him
must
be
different
from
my
relations
with
those
who
were
not
my
brothers
and
all
went
to
crystallise
an
intellectual
judgment
or
a
set
of
criteria
as
it
were
to
guide
all
sane
unemotional
acts
and
even
to
control
and
repress
any
emotional
acts
these
criteria
i
say
became
crystallised
became
automatic
in
my
thought
processes
and
now
in
manhood
my
brother
commits
a
lurid
act
an
act
repulsive
to
me
one
capable
of
arousing
emotions
of
anger
of
bitterness
of
hatred
i
experience
an
emotional
impulse
to
pour
my
wrath
upon
him
to
be
bitter
toward
him
to
hate
him
then
i
experience
an
intellectual
impulse
whatever
way
i
may
act
i
must
first
settle
with
my
crystallised
criteria
the
personal
bonds
of
my
boyhood
and
manhood
press
upon
me
the
gracious
acts
and
sacrifices
and
compromises
our
father
and
our
mother
the
duties
of
kinship
and
the
responsibilities
of
blood
thus
two
strive
with
me
i
desire
to
do
two
counter
things
heart
and
head
the
fight
is
waged
and
heart
or
head
i
shall
act
according
to
which
is
the
stronger
impulse
and
if
my
affection
be
stronger
i
shall
not
turn
away
but
clasp
my
brother
in
my
arms
i
fear
i
have
not
made
myself
clear
it
is
difficult
to
write
hurriedly
of
things
psychological
when
the
extreme
demand
is
made
upon
intellect
and
vocabulary
but
at
least
you
may
roughly
catch
my
drift
what
i
have
striven
to
say
is
that
i
forgive
my
brother
not
because
i
him
but
because
of
the
i
bear
him
also
that
this
affection
is
the
product
of
reason
is
the
sum
of
the
judgments
i
have
achieved

progress
is
an
arbitrary
alteration
by
human
efforts
and
devices
of
the
normal
course
of
nature
so
that
civilisation
is
wholly
an
artificial
product
you
ask
me
to
consider
this
refracted
bit
of
sociology
and
by
its
light
to
cast
out
my
exalted
notion
of
love
as
if
you
have
proven
that
love
is
incompatible
with
civilisation
we
make
over
life
with
each
successive
step
but
we
do
not
give
over
living
in
developing
new
forms
and
in
establishing
more
and
more
subtle
social
relations
we
are
only
building
upon
what
we
find
ready
to
hand
the
paradox
of
creature
and
creator
does
not
exist
when
your
sociologist
speaks
of
arbitrary
alterations
he
has
reference
to
polities
and
governments
and
criteria
to
the
material
and
ideal
forces
which
a
progressive
society
may
wield
for
itself
he
can
not
include
under
progress
an
alteration
of
those
needs
of
existence
which
make
up
the
quality
of
existence
speak
of
a
community
which
equally
distributes
the
products
of
labour
and
i
will
grant
that
there
has
been
an
arbitrary
alteration
the
normal
course
of
nature
being
that
the
stronger
openly
and
even
with
the
common
assent
takes
to
the
repletion
of
his
desire
from
the
weaker
but
speak
of
a
condition
so
progressive
that
it
subverts
the
need
so
that
where
in
the
one
case
hunger
was
equitably
gratified
in
the
other
hunger
was
done
away
with
and
i
will
say
that
you
are
giving
an
arabian
nights
entertainment
love
is
of
a
piece
with
life
like
hunger
like
joy
like
death
your
progress
can
not
leave
it
behind
your
civilisation
must
become
the
exponent
of
it
your
last
letter
is
formal
and
elaborate
and
equivocal
in
it
you
remind
me
menacingly
of
the
possibilities
of
progress
you
posit
that
love
is
at
best
artificial
and
you
apotheosise
the
brain
as
an
emancipated
rationality
you
say
you
cut
yourself
loose
from
the
convention
of
feeling
progress
can
not
affect
the
need
and
the
power
to
love
this
i
have
already
stated
how
is
it
under
our
control
to
love
or
not
to
love
life
is
elaborate
or
it
is
simple
it
depends
upon
the
point
of
view
and
you
may
call
love
the
paraphernalia
of
its
or
you
may
call
it
more
the
blood
and
body
of
all
that
quickens
a
transubstantiation
which
all
accept
reverently
or
irreverently
as
the
case
may
be
i
can
more
readily
conceive
the
existence
of
a
central
committee
elected
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
marriages
of
a
community
than
of
a
community
satisfied
with
such
a
committee
there
is
no
logic
in
social
events
the
world
persists
in
not
taking
the
next
step
and
what
to

social
scout
looked

dusty

may
prove
to
be
the
highway

for
the
hoboing

issues
are
constantly
cropping
up
to
knock
out
the
main
issues
of
the
stump
orator
so
let
us
be
humble
for
this
reason
i
refuse
to
discuss
possibilities
in
infinity
you
and
i
can
not
have
become
products
of
an
environment
which
is
not
in
existence
it
is
safe
to
suppose
that
our
needs
are
like
those
of
the
race
and
that
in
us
nothing
is
vestigial
that
is
active
in
others
you
can
not
have
become
too
rational
to
love
the
device
has
not
yet
been
formed
you
think
i
should
take
your
word
for
it
but
why
have
you
never
found
yourself
in
the
wrong
never
disobeyed
your
best
promptings
never
meant
to
take
the
good
and
grasped
the
bad
is
it
not
possible
that
you
are
not
yet
awake
or
god
pity
you
that
you
are
hidebound
in
the
dogmatism
of
your
bit
of
thinking
it
is
for
the
second
point
of
your
letter
that
i
called
you
equivocal
earlier
in
our
discussion
i
remember
you
laid
stress
on
the
fact
that
love
is
an
instinct
common
to
all
forms
of
life
now
you
go
to
great
lengths
in
order
to
show
that
it
is
artificial
how
do
you
differentiate
between
the
artificial
and
nature
surely
a
development
is
not
artificial
because
it
is
recent
surely
man
is
as
integral
to
life
as
his
progenitors
when
we
come
to
civilisation
we
are
face
to
face
with
the
largest
and
subtlest
thing
in
life
and
the
civilisation
of
human
society
is
not
artificial
it
is
the
fulfilment
of
the
nature
of
man
the
promise
made
good
the
career
established
the
influence
sent
out
a
universe
of
and
a
civilising
force
constantly
causing
change
for
change
is
growth
constantly
compelling
expression
of
that
change
to
conceive
it
is
to
conceive
infinitude
and
the
purpose
development
always
development
to
that
end
the
individual
perishes
to
that
end
the
race
is
conserved
to
that
end
the
peril
and
the
sacrifice
and
the
agony
of
triumph
in
the
overcharged
heart
at
its
last
bound
and
what
is
this
refining
of
the
type
this
goal
for
which
we
all
make
with
such
tragic
directness
but
the
gaining
in
the
power
to
love
we
begin
with
love
to
end
with
greater
love
and
that
is
progress
to
write
the
epic
of
civilisation
is
a
task
for
some
giant
artist
who
shall
combine
in
himself
homer
and
shakespeare
and
the
work
will
be
a
love
story
we
do
not
throw
away
the
grain
and
keep
the
chaff
nor
do
we
transmit
the
absurdities
and
philanderings
alone
if
in
the
lover
voice
throb
the
voices
of
myriads
of
lovers
it
is
because
he
is
stirred
even
as
they
if
a
ballad
wakes
a
response
in
him
it
is
because
its
motif
has
been
singing
itself
of
its
own
accord
in
his
heart
and
its
rhythm
was
the
dream
nightingale
to
which
he
bade
her
hearken
behind
the
tradition
lies
the
fact
the
expression
may
be
ephemeral
the
song
flat
the
motto
conventional
but
the
feeling
which
prompted
it
is
true
else
it
could
not
have
survived
and
it
has
more
than
survived
it
has
grown
with
growth
for
centuries
it
lodged
in
the
nature
of
man
lulled
in
acquiescence
then
when
the
sense
of
recognition
awoke
back
in
those
wondrous
young
days
it
wakened
to
pale
life
and
now
the
feeling
is
man
whole
support
giving
him
courage
to
work
and
purpose
to
live
but
the
half
brute
of
the
london
slums
kicks
his
wife
when
she
offends
him
and
knows
nothing
of
love
well
for
the
honour
of
love
that
it
is
so
the
half
brute
of
the
london
slums
had
not
food
enough
when
a
child
and
malnutrition
is
deadly
later
he
stole
and
lied
in
order
to
eat
and
he
was
bullied
and
kicked
for
it
out
of
human
shape
the
trick
was
passed
on
to
him
the
unfortunate
of
the
london
slums
will
push
us
all
from
heaven
gate
because
we
do
not
do
battle
with
the
conditions
that
make
him
it
is
not
such
as
he
that
should
lead
you
to
scorn
love
for
he
is
a
mistake
and
a
crime
in
your
example
of
the
isolated
boy
babe
and
girl
babe
we
meet
with
a
different
condition
the
individual
repeats
the
history
of
the
race
and
as
these
have
been
left
out
by
the
civilising
forces
they
revert
to
past
racial
states
for
these
it
is
natural
to
live
stolidly
is
it
therefore
natural
for
us
the
point
i
make
is
that
our
refinement
crying
in
us
with
great
voice
is
as
much
a
part
of
us
as
are
the
simple
few
hungers
of
the
racial
infant
we
are
not
the
less
natural
for
being
subtle
and
can
it
not
be
that
the
face
of
romance
reveals
itself
even
to
savage
eyes
according
to
the
need
is
the
power
and
the
early
man
needs
must
hope
and
desire
he
is
curbed
by
waiting
and
taught
by
loss
in
the
hunting
he
is
hungry
and
he
dreams
that
he
is
feasting
this
dream
is
his
romance
a
red
flicker
in
the
dawn
then
still
the
gray
to
suppose
this
is
not
to
be
unscientific
for
what
is
true
of
us
must
have
had
a
beginning
and
feeling
as
well
as
being
can
not
have
been
spontaneously
generated
there
is
an
absolute
gravitation
to
justice
in
nature
this
was
the
creed
preached
by
huxley
to
kingsley
a
week
after
his
boy
death
grief
had
turned
the
mind
upon
itself
and
in
the
upheaval
he
formulated
a
philosophy
of
faith
and
joy
our
reward
is
meted
out
according
to
our
obedience
to
all
of
the
law
spiritual
and
physical
nature
keeps
a
ledger
paying
glad
life
arrears
each
minute
of
time
and
the
creed
rises
to
my
lips
when
i
hear
you
cry
shame
upon
the
delight
of
love
it
must
be
good
this
thing
which
is
so
fraught
with
joy
you
brand
it
sense
delight
but
all
delight
is
of
the
senses
and
darwin
at
the
conclusion
of
the
descent
of
man
if
he
was
not
overtaken
by
a
feeling
of
incompleteness
in
the
work
and
a
consuming
fever
for
the
further
task
was
glad
in
a
human
way
with
the
senses
and
through
the
emotions
darwin
supreme
moment
may
have
come
at
quite
a
different
time
what
can
we
know
of
the
moments
of
repletion
that
fall
into
another
life
with
huxley
we
may
only
know
that
our
hearts
bound
high
when
we
strike
a
chord
of
harmony
and
prove
ourselves
obedient
to
all
of
the
law
and
our
hearts
bound
high
when
we
love
it
is
nature
way
of
showing
her
approval
oh
the
strength
of
love
and
the
miracles
of
its
compensations
the
sense
of
becoming
that
it
gives
even
in
its
defeats
the
gladness
that
ripples
in
its
throat
the
day
for
asceticism
is
gone
or
shall
we
say
the
night
we
are
not
afraid
of
sense
delights
we
are
intent
upon
living
on
all
sides
of
our
natures
roundly
and
naturally
you
have
a
fine
gospel
of
work
and
i
congratulate
you
upon
it
but
you
make
no
mention
of
the
purpose
of
it
all
it
must
not
be
work
for
work
sake
when
i
heard
the
learned
astronomer
says
whitman
do
you
remember
he
caught
in
one
hour
the
whole
majesty
caught
to
himself
the
wonder
that
was
unseen
by
the
watching
astronomers
somehow
you
feel
the
learned
ones
had
made
a
mistake
in
calculating
so
long
that
they
had
no
time
to
see
with
personal
eyes
the
glory
of
the
stars
and
that
whitman
had
been
philosopher
and
had
gained
where
they
failed
the
inspiration
of
the
poet
of
the
painter
of
the
economist
and
biologist
is
in
the
revelation
which
they
receive
of
what
to
do
and
why
to
do
for
this
reason
philosophy
which
treats
of
the
life
and
works
of
man
is
in
the
highest
sense
sociological
the
generalisations
of
philosophy
go
to
improve
our
methods
so
that
we
may
have
greater
proneness
for
sense
of
delight
and
greater
possibility
for
sense
delight
why
what
else
is
there
you
are
a
poet
and
you
give
an
unrestorable
day
when
the
sun
is
shining
and
the
hills
lie
purple
in
the
distance
to
writing
a
sonnet
if
you
do
so
merely
to
employ
yourself
it
must
be
that
the
wolf
of
despair
is
at
your
being
door
you
have
come
to
the
end
and
the
sun
and
the
hills
do
not
matter
you
and
they
have
parted
company
but
if
you
write
impelled
by
the
wish
that
others
should
read
and
recognise
read
and
remember
and
grow
to
know
and
feel
better
and
perhaps
to
love
the
sun
and
hills
better
then
is
yours
a
work
of
love
and
it
will
be
made
good
to
you
so
that
for
the
day
which
you
have
not
seen
your
night
shall
be
instinct
with
light
and
if
your
labours
are
more
especially
in
the
service
of
art
then
also
with
each
approach
toward
expression
you
are
warmed
through
with
the
delight
of
achievement
is
my
meaning
quite
dashed
away
by
this
torrent
of
speech
it
is
simply
this
before
we
think
we
feel
and
the
end
of
thinking
is
feeling
the
century
of
voltaire
and
johnson
held
that
man
is
rational
the
century
of
james
ribot
lange
and
wundt
is
thrilled
to
the
heart
with
the
doctrine
that
first
last
and
always
man
is
emotional
to
speak
loosely
the
dimensions
of
the
human
cosmos
are
feeling
emotion
and
sensation
build
your
fine
structures
we
like
to
see
the
foundations
laid
well
and
the
thick
walls
go
up
keep
to
your
wizard
inventions
we
like
to
live
in
a
magic
world
and
ah
the
indomitable
machines
with
their
austere
promise
of
free
days
for
weary
hands
and
ah
the
locomotives
and
the
ships
steaming
their
ways
toward
intercourse
toward
comity
toward
fellowship
we
like
the
intricacy
and
the
vastness
of
the
world
in
which
we
live
but
an
unconsidered
life
is
not
fit
to
be
lived
by
any
man
says
aristotle
we
must
consider
the
phenomenon
civilisation
searching
down
for
the
nucleus
of
its
worth
we
will
find
that
the
stone
structure
without
hope
were
a
pitiable
thing
that
the
making
of
compacts
and
the
banking
of
capital
without
hope
were
pitiable
this
hope
that
is
the
life
germane
the
immortal
flash
of
mortality
the
most
keenly
human
point
in
all
humanity
is
the
hope
for
greater
and
greater
social
happiness
our
world
is
an
ever
unfinished
house
which
we
are
employed
in
building
if
we
are
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
the
architect
and
not
of
the
we
will
hope
sweetly
for
the
work
the
house
beautiful
will
begin
to
mean
our
life
and
each
night
we
will
consult
our
drawings
looking
to
it
that
on
the
house
built
of
our
days
the
sun
shall
wester
and
that
within
shall
be
intimacy
and
laughter
great
speech
and
close
love
looking
to
it
that
the
home
be
such
as
to
better
tenant
so
that
he
be
more
loving
and
lovable
than
the
one
of
yesterday
we
are
wrong
perhaps
long
ago
we
were
no
less
than
now
when
we
reached
a
hand
in
the
darkness
and
grasped
that
of
our
fellow
the
love
and
the
strongly
frail
human
abandon
were
no
less
we
have
not
grown
in
heart
munificence
perhaps
it
is
one
of
the
illusions
only
but
the
hope
is
ours
for
what
do
you
hope
dane
xxvii
from
the
same
to
the
same
london
july
your
birthday
herbert
and
for
greeting
i
state
that
i
walk
your
length
with
you
a
truce
to
quarrelling
it
is
now
a
year
since
you
informed
me
you
were
going
to
be
married
and
since
then
the
gods
have
thundered
their
laughter
at
the
sight
of
two
muttering
men
who
sat
themselves
on
the
axes
of
earth
to
dangle
their
legs
into
orbit
vastness
chronic
somnambulists
that
they
are
they
took
their
monopolist
way
thither
in
their
sleep
i
can
not
tell
you
how
full
of
vagary
the
correspondence
we
have
fallen
into
seems
to
me
i
deliberately
attempted
to
write
you
into
passion
and
for
months
you
deliberately
continued
to
convict
yourself
out
of
your
own
mouth
and
we
did
not
see
that
it
was
tragic
and
comic
and
preposterous
could
we
personify
this
our
dealing
we
would
do
well
to
call
it
a
kind
of
caliban
and
the
tentacles
we
threw
out
clawing
at
everything
stealing
for
prop
to
our
little
theory
all
of
man
and
god
it
is
the
conceit
of
us
that
i
find
utterly
hopeless
of
grace
so
i
drop
my
rôle
of
omniscience
i
take
my
form
off
the
hub
believing
the
system
will
maintain
its
gravity
though
i
go
my
private
way
and
i
promise
to
let
you
alone
forgive
me
and
god
bless
you
ah
yes
and
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
all
my
heart
in
the
blessing
and
the
wish
i
did
some
remembering
dear
lad
when
you
were
born
i
was
five
years
younger
than
you
are
now
yet
i
felt
myself
old
if
we
were
as
old
as
we
feel
we
would
die
of
old
age
at
my
life
seemed
all
behind
me
long
turbulent
packed
with
pain
useless
i
spoke
of
myself
as
if
all
were
over
it
had
been
full
of
purpose
but
what
came
of
it
a
few
rhymes
and
a
spoilt
hope
to
my
morbid
fancy
your
having
come
to
be
was
a
signal
for
me
to
go
i
had
no
thought
of
dying
yet
i
accepted
you
as
the
proof
of
my
failure
in
the
exacting
eyes
of
the
genius
of
the
race
i
was
insolvent
you
were
not
mine
i
looked
into
time
and
saw
none
of
me
there
yet
the
letter
i
wrote
to
your
parents
was
sincere
how
else
and
that
night
and
the
next
and
the
next
i
wrote
gentleman
adventurers
which
the
critics
called
the
epitome
of
all
that
is
balladesque
one
pitied
the
dead
because
they
could
go
forth
no
more
on
water
and
under
sky
this
poem
written
in
a
mood
which
beneficent
nature
sends
on
the
spirit
has
served
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
as
the
complete
and
accepted
catalogue
of
the
reasons
for
living
well
i
must
not
laugh
at
it
it
may
be
true
that
the
passion
of
my
heart
incarnated
itself
in
it
beyond
the
rest
that
my
one
song
sang
itself
out
those
first
three
days
of
your
life
if
so
it
is
true
that
love
is
never
cheated
of
its
fruit
and
that
the
joy
which
might
have
been
for
the
individual
oozes
out
of
him
to
the
race
that
the
strength
which
would
have
settled
upon
itself
in
the
calm
of
satisfied
hope
filters
through
him
outwards
good
night
lad
my
hand
is
on
your
shoulder
and
i
am
loath
to
take
it
off
for
a
while
i
would
like
what
can
not
be
to
travel
with
you
the
fragrant
with
hay
to
cross
the
stiles
and
knock
upon
the
cabin
doors
and
enter
where
sorrow
and
where
gladness
is
big
with
greeting
and
sure
of
welcome
i
have
often
pleased
myself
with
the
fancy
that
the
outer
aspects
of
life
are
patterned
after
the
inner
so
that
in
the
map
of
the
spirit
are
to
be
found
city
and
country
wood
desert
and
sea
so
that
we
know
these
outer
worlds
through
having
travelled
the
worlds
within
though
i
stay
behind
my
eyes
can
follow
you
from
this
night
landmark
along
the
stretch
on
to
the
city
avenues
up
the
highways
tracing
the
twists
of
the
bypaths
clambering
untrod
trails
of
wilderness
and
mountain
on
on
till
out
upon
the
sea
in
one
of
the
near
turnings
a
woman
with
waiting
face
smiles
subtly
her
hands
beckon
you
to
the
tryst
godspeed
my
son
dane
xxviii
from
herbert
wace
to
dane
kempton
the
ridge
berkeley
california
august
as
i
have
constantly
insisted
our
difference
is
temperamental
the
common
words
we
lay
hold
of
mean
one
thing
to
you
and
another
thing
to
me
i
do
not
equivocate
when
i
say
that
love
is
instinctive
and
that
the
expression
of
love
is
artificial
art
as
i
understand
the
term
in
its
broadness
contradistinguishes
from
nature
whatever
man
contrives
or
devises
is
an
artifice
a
thing
of
art
not
of
nature
and
therefore
artificial
as
for
ourselves
among
animals
we
are
the
only
real
inventors
and
artificers
instead
of
hair
and
hide
we
have
soft
skins
and
we
weave
cunning
textures
and
wear
wondrous
garments
in
cold
weather
in
place
of
eating
much
fat
meat
we
keep
ourselves
warm
by
grate
fires
and
steam
heat
we
cut
up
our
meat
chunks
with
pieces
of
iron
hardened
by
fire
and
sharpened
by
stone
and
we
eat
fish
with
a
fork
instead
of
our
fingers
we
put
a
roof
over
our
heads
to
keep
out
storm
and
sunshine
sleep
in
pent
rooms
and
are
afraid
of
the
good
night
air
and
the
open
sky
in
short
we
are
consummately
artificial
as
i
recollect
i
have
shown
that
the
natural
expression
of
the
love
instinct
is
bestial
and
brutal
and
violent
i
have
shown
how
imagination
entered
into
the
development
of
the
expression
of
this
love
instinct
till
it
became
and
in
turn
i
have
shown
how
artificial
was
the
romantic
expression
of
this
love
instinct
by
isolating
a
boy
babe
and
a
girl
babe
in
a
natural
state
wherein
they
expressed
their
love
instinct
bestially
and
brutally
and
violently
as
you
say
they
have
simply
been
left
out
by
the
civilising
force
and
this
civilising
or
socialising
force
is
simply
the
sum
of
our
many
inventions
the
isolated
pair
merely
expressed
their
instincts
in
the
unartificial
natural
way
they
had
not
been
taught
a
certain
particular
fashion
in
which
to
express
those
instincts
as
have
you
and
i
and
all
artificial
beings
been
taught
as
finck
has
said
not
till
dante
nuova
appeared
was
the
gospel
of
modern
love
the
romantic
adoration
of
a
maiden
by
a
youth
revealed
for
the
first
time
in
definite
language
dante
and
the
men
who
foreshadowed
and
followed
him
were
inventors
they
introduced
an
artifice
for
protracting
one
of
our
most
vital
pleasures
well
they
succeeded
and
what
of
it
there
are
artifices
and
artifices
and
some
are
better
than
others
the
automobile
is
a
more
cunning
artifice
than
the
the
subway
than
a
palanquin
devices
come
and
devices
go
change
is
the
essence
of
progress
all
is
development
the
end
of
rapes
and
romances
is
the
same
perpetuation
there
may
be
head
love
as
well
as
heart
love
and
in
the
time
to
come
when
the
brain
ceases
to
be
the
servant
of
the
belly
the
head
the
lackey
of
the
heart
in
that
time
stirpiculture
which
is
scientific
perpetuation
will
take
the
place
of
romantic
love
and
in
the
present
there
may
be
men
ready
for
that
time
there
must
be
a
beginning
else
would
we
still
be
jolting
in
and
i
am
ready
for
that
time
now
you
say
love
is
of
a
piece
with
life
like
hunger
like
joy
like
death
quite
true
and
civilisation
is
merely
the
expression
of
life
a
variform
utterance
which
includes
love
and
hunger
and
joy
and
death
else
what
is
this
civilisation
for
how
did
it
happen
to
be
and
i
answer
it
is
the
sum
of
the
many
inventions
we
have
made
to
aid
us
in
our
pursuit
of
life
and
love
and
joy
it
helps
us
to
live
more
abundantly
to
love
more
fruitfully
to
joy
more
intelligently
and
to
get
grim
old
death
by
his
knotty
throat
and
hold
him
at
arm
length
as
long
as
possible
i
stated
that
all
progress
consists
in
the
arbitrary
alteration
by
human
efforts
and
devices
of
the
normal
course
of
nature
this
sociological
concept
comes
inevitably
into
accord
with
my
philosophy
of
love
it
is
the
law
of
development
and
all
things
of
human
life
which
includes
love
come
inside
of
it
wherefore
certainly
i
am
not
outside
our
province
when
i
demand
of
you
to
bring
your
philosophy
of
love
into
like
accord
incidentally
i
will
state
that
i
fallen
in
love
i
have
grown
feverish
with
desire
gone
mad
with
dumb
yearning
i
have
felt
my
intellect
lose
dominion
and
learned
that
i
was
only
a
garmented
beast
for
all
the
many
inventions
very
like
the
other
beasts
ungarmented
nay
i
am
no
theorist
no
dogmatist
nor
am
i
a
chastely
simple
young
man
mooning
in
virginal
innocence
my
generalisations
have
been
tempered
in
the
heats
of
passion
and
what
i
know
i
know
and
without
hearsay
i
have
seen
a
learned
man
drunk
with
wine
interrogate
the
new
states
of
consciousness
of
his
unwonted
condition
and
so
doing
gain
a
more
comprehensive
psychological
insight
so
i
with
my
loves
i
was
impelled
toward
the
women
i
shall
presently
particularise
i
asked
why
the
impulsion
i
reasoned
to
see
if
there
were
a
difference
between
these
illicit
passions
of
mine
and
the
illicit
passions
of
my
respectable
and
respected
friends
and
i
found
no
difference
separated
from
codes
and
conventions
shorn
of
imagination
divested
of
romance
stripped
naked
down
to
the
core
of
the
matter
it
was
old
mother
nature
crying
through
us
every
man
and
woman
of
us
for
progeny
her
one
unceasing
and
eternal
cry
progeny
progeny
progeny
just
as
little
girls
instinctively
foreshadowing
motherhood
play
with
dolls
so
children
feel
vague
sex
promptings
and
in
sweetly
ridiculous
ways
love
and
quarrel
and
make
up
after
the
approved
fashion
of
lovers
you
loved
little
girls
in
pigtails
and
pinafores
we
all
did
and
in
our
lives
there
is
nothing
fairer
and
more
joyful
to
look
back
upon
than
those
same
little
pigtails
and
pinafores
but
i
shall
pass
the
child
loves
by
and
instance
first
my
calf
love
do
you
remember
the
incident
of
the
torn
jacket
and
the
blackened
eyes
so
inexplicable
at
the
time
try
as
you
would
neither
you
nor
waring
could
get
anything
out
of
me
oh
believe
me
it
was
tragic
i
was
fifteen
fifteen
and
athrill
with
a
strange
new
pulse
flushed
as
the
dawn
with
the
promise
of
day
and
of
course
i
thought
it
was
the
day
that
i
loved
as
a
man
loved
and
that
no
man
ever
loved
more
well
well
i
laugh
now
i
was
only
fifteen
a
young
calf
who
went
out
and
butted
heads
with
another
calf
in
the
back
pasture
she
was
a
demure
little
coquette
celia
genoine
professor
daughter
if
you
will
recollect
ah
i
hear
you
remonstrate
but
she
was
a
woman
just
so
fifteen
and
is
usually
the
way
of
calf
loves
i
invested
her
with
all
the
glow
and
colour
of
first
youth
and
in
her
presence
became
a
changed
being
i
blushed
if
she
looked
at
me
trembled
at
the
touch
of
her
hand
or
the
scent
of
her
hair
to
be
in
her
presence
was
to
be
closeted
with
the
awfulness
and
splendour
of
god
i
read
immortality
in
her
eyes
a
smile
from
her
blinded
me
a
gentle
word
or
caressing
look
and
i
went
faint
and
dizzy
and
i
was
content
to
lurk
in
some
corner
and
gaze
upon
her
secretly
with
all
my
soul
and
i
took
long
solitary
walks
with
book
of
verse
beneath
my
arm
and
learned
to
love
as
lovers
had
loved
before
me
sufficient
romance
was
engendered
for
me
to
pass
more
than
one
night
worshipping
beneath
her
window
i
mooned
and
sentimentalised
and
fell
into
a
gentle
melancholy
until
you
and
waring
began
to
worry
over
an
early
decline
to
consult
specialists
and
by
trick
and
stratagem
to
entice
me
into
eating
more
and
reading
less
but
she
married
ah
i
have
forgotten
whom
anyway
she
married
and
there
was
trouble
about
it
too
and
i
bade
adieu
to
love
forever
then
came
the
love
of
my
whelpage
i
was
twenty
and
she
a
mad
wanton
creature
wonderful
and
unmoral
and
filled
with
life
to
the
brim
my
blood
pounds
hot
even
now
as
i
conjure
her
up
the
ungarmented
beast
my
dear
dane
the
great
primordial
ungarmented
beast
mighty
to
procreate
indomitable
in
battle
invincible
in
love
love
do
i
not
know
it
can
i
not
understand
how
that
splendid
fighting
animal
antony
quartered
the
globe
with
his
sword
and
pillowed
his
head
between
the
slim
breasts
of
egyptian
cleopatra
while
that
world
crashed
to
wrack
and
ruin
as
i
say
this
was
the
love
of
my
whelpage
and
it
was
vigorous
masterful
masculine
there
was
no
sentimentalising
no
fond
foolishness
of
youth
nor
was
there
that
cool
calm
poise
which
comes
of
the
calculation
and
discretion
of
age
man
and
woman
we
were
in
full
tide
strong
simple
and
elemental
life
rioted
in
our
veins
we
were
with
the
ferment
and
it
is
out
of
such
abundance
that
mother
nature
has
always
exacted
her
progeny
from
the
strictly
emotional
and
naturalistic
viewpoint
i
must
consider
it
even
now
the
perfect
love
but
it
was
decreed
that
i
should
develop
into
an
intellectual
animal
and
be
something
more
than
a
mere
unconscious
puppet
of
the
reproductive
forces
so
head
mastered
my
heart
and
i
laid
the
grip
of
my
will
over
the
passion
and
went
my
way
and
then
came
another
man
wife
a
woman
the
perfect
mother
made
to
know
the
lip
clasp
of
a
child
you
know
the
kind
the
type
the
mothers
of
men
i
call
them
and
so
long
as
there
are
such
women
on
this
earth
that
long
may
we
keep
faith
in
the
breed
of
men
the
wanton
was
the
mate
woman
but
this
was
the
mother
woman
the
last
and
highest
and
holiest
in
the
hierarchy
of
life
in
her
all
criteria
were
satisfied
and
i
reasoned
my
need
of
her
and
by
this
i
take
it
that
i
was
passing
out
of
my
blind
puppetdom
i
was
becoming
a
conscious
selective
factor
in
the
scheme
of
reproduction
choosing
a
mate
not
in
the
lust
of
my
eyes
but
in
the
desire
of
my
fatherhood
oh
dane
she
was
glorious
but
she
was
another
man
wife
had
i
been
living
unartificially
in
a
state
of
nature
i
would
certainly
have
brained
her
husband
a
really
splendid
fellow
and
dragged
her
off
with
me
shameless
under
the
sky
or
had
her
husband
not
been
a
man
or
had
he
been
but
half
a
man
i
doubt
not
that
i
would
have
wrested
her
from
him
as
it
was
i
yearned
dumbly
and
observed
the
conventions
nor
are
these
experiences
heart
soils
and
smirches
they
have
educated
me
fitted
me
for
that
which
is
yet
to
be
and
i
have
written
of
them
to
show
you
that
i
am
no
closet
naturalist
that
i
speak
authoritatively
out
of
adequate
understanding
since
the
end
of
love
when
all
is
said
and
done
is
progeny
and
since
the
love
of
is
crude
and
wasteful
as
an
inventor
and
artificer
i
take
it
upon
myself
to
substitute
reasoned
foresight
and
selection
for
the
and
blundering
selection
of
mother
nature
what
would
you
the
old
dame
would
have
made
a
mess
of
it
had
i
let
her
have
her
way
she
tried
hard
to
mate
me
with
the
wanton
for
it
was
not
her
method
to
look
into
the
future
to
see
if
a
better
mother
for
my
progeny
awaited
me
and
now
comes
hester
i
approach
her
not
with
the
ardours
of
first
youth
nor
with
the
lusty
love
madness
of
young
manhood
but
as
an
intellectual
man
seeking
for
self
and
mate
the
ripe
and
rounded
manhood
and
womanhood
which
comes
only
through
the
having
of
children
children
which
must
be
properly
born
and
bred
in
this
way
and
in
this
way
only
can
we
fully
express
ourselves
and
the
life
that
is
in
us
we
shall
utter
ourselves
in
the
finest
speech
in
the
world
and
our
children
being
properly
born
and
bred
it
shall
be
in
the
finest
terms
of
the
finest
speech
in
the
world
to
do
this
is
to
have
lived
herbert
xxix
from
dane
kempton
to
herbert
wace
london
queen
road
chelsea
august
you
insist
that
the
question
is
not
on
the
value
of
love
but
on
the
significance
of
the
artificial
be
that
as
it
may
to
me
love
is
integral
with
life
and
to
speak
of
civilising
it
away
seems
in
point
of
fact
as
preposterous
and
as
anomalous
as
a
hamletless
play
of
hamlet
you
forget
that
in
developing
you
carry
yourself
along
you
change
yet
you
remain
racial
and
natural
else
there
were
too
many
missing
links
in
all
your
departments
we
read
homer
telling
proof
that
the
chain
of
sympathy
stretches
unbroken
through
epochs
of
inventions
and
discoveries
and
revolutions
truism
that
it
is
it
presents
itself
with
particular
force
at
this
stage
with
how
much
force
we
stand
in
danger
of
exaggerating
these
vociferous
thoughts
this
question
of
naturalness
as
opposed
to
artificiality
is
not
immediately
pertinent
to
our
problem
nor
is
the
matter
of
optimism
and
pessimism
nor
the
biologic
idea
of
survival
we
should
have
looked
more
to
the
way
of
love
in
the
lives
of
men
and
women
and
become
historians
of
the
method
and
conduct
of
the
force
there
would
have
been
less
confusion
so
i
write
be
that
as
it
may
and
go
back
to
more
immediate
considerations
and
yet
we
were
not
far
wrong
the
little
flower
in
the
crannied
wall
could
tell
what
god
and
man
is
this
is
of
all
thoughts
the
most
charged
with
truth
let
me
understand
one
of
your
conclusions
root
and
all
and
all
in
all
and
such
is
the
gracious
plan
of
oneness
in
the
branching
and
leafage
and
uptowering
that
i
must
know
and
name
the
tree
your
winding
bypath
could
i
but
follow
it
to
the
end
must
bring
me
to
the
highway
of
your
thought
every
step
of
the
journey
destination
but
soon
i
shall
be
with
you
the
fifth
of
next
month
after
all
the
arrangements
as
planned
then
we
will
begin
to
know
each
other
and
we
will
no
longer
be
tormented
by
the
irksomeness
of
writing
therefore
until
easier
and
more
fluent
times
to
the
heart
of
the
subject
straight
your
how
well
you
have
outgrown
them
and
how
ably
you
criticise
them
they
have
not
withstood
the
test
of
time
for
you
bear
them
no
loyalty
calfdom
and
whelpage
vagaries
of
adolescence
you
call
them
you
do
not
show
them
much
respect
for
this
reason
your
examples
lose
what
weight
they
might
have
borne
they
belong
so
wholly
to
the
past
they
are
mere
wraiths
of
bygone
stirrings
they
can
not
clothe
you
with
knowledge
of
love
cold
now
what
boots
it
that
you
have
been
afire
you
can
not
be
taught
by
what
is
utterly
over
you
are
catching
what
i
aim
to
say
i
hope
for
i
aim
to
say
much
put
it
that
instead
of
a
girl
whom
you
idealised
it
was
a
principle
some
scheme
of
reform
which
you
honoured
with
all
the
passion
of
young
hope
and
dream
and
which
knit
your
alert
being
into
a
laocoon
of
striving
your
maturer
eyes
see
this
ideal
impossible
and
narrow
in
no
wise
can
it
satisfy
your
bolder
reach
and
larger
sympathy
but
you
do
not
laugh
at
what
has
been
if
you
strove
for
it
sincerely
at
any
time
no
matter
how
remote
you
could
never
again
deride
it
because
once
you
loved
it
you
are
eternal
keeper
of
the
key
to
its
good
what
has
been
wholly
yours
you
never
quite
desert
nothing
has
remained
to
you
of
your
therefore
your
recital
of
them
is
empty
of
meaning
if
you
were
in
love
and
because
of
your
philosophy
you
determined
to
do
battle
with
your
feeling
your
experience
would
be
more
authoritative
you
have
known
love
and
having
known
you
refuse
it
henceforth
it
must
be
reason
and
not
feeling
what
is
your
objection
you
ask
this
merely
that
the
thing
can
not
be
marriage
to
be
marriage
must
come
through
love
through
the
reddest
romance
of
love
through
fire
of
the
spirit
yes
even
through
the
love
of
calfdom
and
whelpage
else
it
is
a
mockery
where
is
the
woman
of
character
who
would
sell
the
and
of
her
existence
for
a
neat
catalogue
of
possible
advantages
where
is
the
man
who
would
frankly
and
without
embellishment
dare
make
such
proposal
you
point
to
yourself
but
you
have
never
explained
yourself
to
hester
and
even
to
me
you
are
embellishing
the
matter
with
all
the
might
in
your
persuasive
pen
the
ardours
of
calfdom
and
whelpage
that
you
smile
at
i
would
have
you
throb
with
you
underrate
the
firstlings
of
the
heart
the
rose
and
white
blossoming
the
call
upon
the
senses
and
the
readiness
to
respond
and
to
fulfil
to
give
and
to
take
to
be
and
make
happy
the
great
pride
and
utter
abandon
which
is
young
love
at
fifteen
fortunately
for
the
development
of
mind
and
character
hope
is
placed
where
hope
must
pine
love
then
is
doomed
to
be
tragic
the
youth
attains
to
be
denied
but
he
sounds
his
depth
thereafter
he
knows
what
to
expect
of
himself
he
has
a
precedent
after
this
he
will
count
it
a
sin
to
forget
and
to
accept
the
solace
of
mediocrity
in
this
lies
the
value
of
the
tragedy
i
sometimes
think
that
whatever
is
youngest
is
best
it
is
the
young
that
timid
and
bold
pay
greatest
reverence
to
knowledge
receiving
without
chill
of
prejudice
and
shameful
cowardice
of
quibbling
the
brave
new
thought
wisdom
may
be
of
age
but
passion
for
scholarships
and
hardy
prospecting
in
the
treasure
mines
of
research
is
of
young
pioneerhood
alone
it
is
a
youth
who
dares
be
radical
who
dares
in
splendid
largess
build
mistake
upon
mistake
bleeding
his
life
out
in
service
and
it
is
a
youth
standing
tiptoe
upon
the
earth
now
waiting
in
unperturbed
ease
now
searching
with
unbridled
zeal
who
is
lover
and
mystic
the
best
is
yet
to
be
says
rabbi
ben
ezra
the
last
of
life
for
which
the
first
is
made
yes
the
last
of
life
will
be
good
but
only
if
it
is
like
youth
beating
with
its
pulse
and
instinct
with
its
spirit
the
unhappy
youth
is
left
on
the
but
not
to
die
the
challenge
him
to
put
forth
greater
strength
in
fiercer
wars
he
learns
hard
and
well
indeed
i
can
not
leave
this
subject
of
first
love
how
do
you
know
it
was
not
good
for
you
to
love
as
you
did
it
is
strange
you
should
resolve
to
love
no
more
because
at
one
time
you
loved
deeply
enough
almost
to
remain
in
love
it
can
not
be
that
you
have
grown
old
and
that
nature
is
resolving
for
you
you
tell
me
of
your
experiences
in
order
that
i
may
be
convinced
that
you
know
whereof
you
speak
and
i
listen
in
wonder
your
conclusions
are
unwonted
then
something
was
amiss
for
you
have
outgrown
and
forgotten
but
how
is
it
with
you
in
the
present
when
your
indifference
waits
not
upon
time
you
approach
your
future
wife
clothed
in
indifference
as
in
mail
and
you
do
violence
how
can
i
show
you
i
speak
as
i
would
to
a
child
to
whom
it
is
necessary
to
explain
that
it
is
bad
to
abandon
an
education
life
is
a
school
and
to
me
it
seems
that
you
are
about
to
resign
long
before
diploma
and
degree
so
i
interpose
i
was
taught
by
first
love
and
i
honour
that
time
beyond
any
other
i
was
ellen
i
have
been
lonely
for
the
mere
human
need
for
the
sake
of
that
which
to
the
lonely
is
very
dear
i
have
thought
of
marriage
but
i
remembered
and
i
refused
to
do
violence
to
myself
remembering
long
ago
my
standard
was
established
i
learned
how
deeply
i
could
feel
and
i
refuse
to
acknowledge
myself
bankrupt
i
refuse
to
approach
an
honourable
human
being
with
less
than
my
all
until
my
soul
flower
out
again
until
suns
flame
about
my
head
as
in
that
dear
yoretime
i
shall
keep
teeming
with
dreams
and
make
no
affront
i
who
have
seen
love
dare
not
live
without
love
i
would
not
give
in
to
fate
herbert
i
would
assert
my
manhood
i
would
abide
in
the
strength
of
the
first
output
going
with
the
flush
of
the
first
glow
into
the
gloom
i
would
spurn
the
calm
of
compromise
and
mediocrity
and
register
a
high
claim
i
would
keep
the
peace
with
romance
and
fly
her
colours
to
the
last
you
have
lived
it
is
well
and
it
might
have
been
better
but
do
not
give
over
and
talk
of
stirpiculture
you
are
not
wiser
than
the
laws
which
made
you
dane

from
herbert
wace
to
dane
kempton
the
ridge
berkeley
california
september
how
abominable
i
must
seem
to
you
dane
for
certainly
a
creature
is
abominable
that
lays
rough
hands
on
one
dearest
possessions
i
doubt
if
even
you
realise
how
deeply
you
are
stirred
by
my
conduct
towards
love
my
marriage
with
hester
considering
the
quality
and
degree
of
the
contracting
parties
must
appear
as
terrible
to
you
as
the
sodomies
that
caused
god
ancient
wrath
to
destroy
cities
you
see
i
take
your
side
for
the
time
see
with
your
eyes
live
your
thoughts
suffer
what
you
suffer
and
then
i
become
myself
again
and
steel
myself
to
continue
in
what
i
think
is
the
right
after
all
mine
is
the
harder
part
there
are
easier
tasks
than
those
of
the
that
which
is
established
is
hard
to
overthrow
it
has
the
nine
points
of
possession
and
woe
to
him
who
attempts
its
disestablishment
for
it
will
persist
till
it
be
drowned
and
washed
away
in
the
blood
of
the
reformers
and
radicals
love
is
a
convention
men
and
women
are
attached
to
it
as
they
are
attached
to
material
things
as
a
king
is
attached
to
his
crown
or
an
old
family
to
its
ancestral
home
we
have
all
been
led
to
believe
that
love
is
splendid
and
wonderful
and
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
and
it
pains
us
to
part
with
it
faith
we
will
not
part
with
it
the
man
who
would
bid
us
put
it
by
is
a
knave
and
a
fool
a
vile
degraded
wretch
who
will
receive
pardon
neither
in
this
world
nor
the
next
this
is
nothing
new
it
is
the
attitude
of
the
established
whenever
its
conventions
are
attacked
it
was
the
attitude
of
the
jew
toward
christ
of
the
roman
toward
the
christian
of
the
christian
toward
the
infidel
and
the
heretic
and
it
is
sincere
and
natural
all
things
desire
to
endure
and
they
die
hard
love
will
die
hard
as
died
the
idolatries
of
our
forefathers
the
geocentric
theory
of
the
universe
and
the
divine
right
of
kings
so
i
say
the
rancour
and
warmth
of
the
established
when
attacked
is
sincere
the
world
is
mastered
by
the
convention
of
love
and
when
one
profanes
love
holy
of
holies
the
world
is
unutterably
shocked
and
hurt
love
is
a
thing
for
lovers
only
it
must
not
be
approached
by
the
sacrilegious
scientist
let
him
keep
to
his
physics
and
chemistry
things
definite
and
solid
and
gross
love
is
for
ardent
speculation
not
laboratory
analysis
love
is
as
the
reverend
prior
and
the
learned
bodies
told
brother
lippo
of
man
soul
a
fire
smoke
no
it
not
it
vapour
done
up
like
a
babe
in
that
shape
when
you
die
it
leaves
your
mouth
it
well
what
matters
talking
it
the
soul
i
thoroughly
understand
the
popular
sentimental
repugnance
to
a
scientific
discussion
of
love
because
i
dissect
love
and
weigh
and
calculate
it
is
denied
that
i
am
capable
of
experiencing
love
it
is
too
radiant
and
glorious
a
thing
for
a
dull
clod
like
me
to
know
and
because
i
can
not
experience
love
and
be
made
mad
by
it
my
fitness
to
describe
its
phenomena
is
likewise
denied
only
the
lover
may
describe
love
and
only
the
lunatic
i
suppose
may
compose
a
medical
brochure
on
insanity

to

october
it
is
true
that
you
have
a
hard
task
before
you
but
it
is
not
because
you
are
fighting
convention
and
shattering
illusion
it
is
because
you
are
assailing
a
good
love
has
never
acquired
the
prestige
of
the
established
and
the
run
of
marriages
are
prompted
by
advantage
routine
or
passion
so
you
are
no
innovator
herbert
the
idolatry
of
love
will
not
be
overthrown
by
a
drawn
battle
between
those
of
the
faith
and
those
of
the
reformation
nothing
so
spectacular
awaits
us
i
have
a
friend
who
has
undertaken
to
translate
inferno
into
english
keeping
to
the
it
is
like
climbing
the
matterhorn
he
says
gravely
i
get
to
places
where
i
feel
i
can
go
neither
forward
nor
back
the
task
is
prodigious
and
it
is
but
whom
will
it
concern
if
he
succeeds
in
going
forward
there
are
few
who
will
read
his
book
the
translation
is
of
more
importance
to
the
translator
than
to
anyone
else
yet
the
professor
confers
a
degree
upon
us
all
because
a
standard
is
upheld
and
a
man
is
willing
and
able
to
climb
a
matterhorn
of
thought
we
can
ourselves
stride
forward
with
better
courage
the
work
will
be
an
output
of
heroism
and
it
will
ennoble
even
those
who
will
not
know
of
it
i
have
another
friend
who
ruined
his
life
for
love
so
says
the
world
that
you
think
steeped
in
the
idolatry
of
love
a
priest
who
by
a
few
strokes
was
able
to
quell
in
america
a
strong
and
bitter
movement
a
gifted
orator
a
man
of
giant
powers
and
who
was
won
away
at
the
age
of
forty
from
his
career
by
a
mere
girl
the
girl
planned
nothing
she
found
herself
a
force
in
his
life
almost
despite
herself
the
mere
fact
that
she
lived
was
enough
to
wrest
this
titan
from
the
arms
of
the
church
he
told
me
that
she
criticised
him
with
the
directness
of
a
simple
nature
and
that
he
came
to
understand
her
truths
better
than
she
herself
i
think
she
must
have
loved
him
at
first
but
she
did
not
go
to
him
when
all
grew
calm
i
wish
it
could
have
been
otherwise
and
that
she
could
have
brought
him
a
woman
heart
the
priest
as
the
professor
is
a
hero
both
made
great
outputs
there
are
few
who
can
live
like
these
but
because
there
are
a
few
who
can
love
and
work
the
game
is
saved
and
because
there
are
a
few
of
these
we
must
ever
quarrel
with
the
many
who
are
not
like
them
give
all
to
love
obey
thy
heart
friends
kindred
days
estate
good
fame
plans
credit
and
the
muse
nothing
refuse
does
this
really
seem
such
poor
philosophy
to
you
and
when
herbert
will
you
marry
dane

xxxii
from
the
same
to
the
same
stanford
university
november
hester
met
me
at
the
station
and
we
walked
through
the
arboretum
to
her
home
on
the
campus
then
followed
an
evening
together
in
the
dormitory
parlour
i
have
just
left
her
her
face
was
tumultuously
joyous
when
i
murmured
my
at
last
her
tearful
excitement
was
like
barbara
you
did
not
tell
me
she
is
so
young
you
must
have
made
her
feel
our
closeness
or
she
may
have
found
a
bit
of
my
verse
that
all
expressed
her
and
presto
the
one
is
my
friend
her
poet
is
now
her
father
brother
comrade
what
she
chooses
and
all
she
chooses
at
one
time
before
we
were
well
out
of
the
arboretum
our
eyes
met
and
there
was
something
so
sad
and
mild
and
strange
in
the
burn
of
her
gaze
that
i
felt
her
frank
spirit
was
unveiling
itself
in
an
utterness
of
speech
but
i
have
become
too
much
spoilt
by
mere
length
of
living
to
be
able
to
remember
back
and
recognise
what
young
eyes
mean
when
they
look
like
that
from
london
to
palo
alto
is
a
short
trip
if
at
the
end
of
it
you
meet
a
hester
yet
i
am
sad
the
mood
crept
on
me
the
moment
we
grew
aware
that
evening
had
come
and
we
stopped
a
little
in
front
of
the
arch
to
observe
the
of
the
lights
had
begun
to
appear
in
the
corridors
of
the
quadrangle
and
here
and
there
in
a
professor
office
while
roble
and
encina
looked
like
ferries
there
was
a
spell
of
mystery
and
promise
in
the
quiet
which
was
deeper
for
being
suggestive
of
the
seething
just
subsided
it
was
a
silence
that
seemed
to
echo
with
bells
and
recitations
and
babble
and
laughter
and
heartache
i
fell
into
thought
one
generation
cometh
and
another
passeth
away
there
is
no
respite
march
with
time
and
find
death
mayhap
before
it
has
found
you
as
years
ago
the
flamelet
of
the
so
now
these
outposts
of
the
colossal
embryo
of
a
world
derided
me
and
seemed
to
point
me
out
and
away
the
evening
grew
chill
with
a
greeting
in
which
no
kindness
is
your
coming
has
been
announced
in
every
class
and
your
lecture
is
on
the
after
that
can
you
be
depressed
the
light
words
were
spoken
low
as
if
doubtful
whether
they
could
be
taken
in
good
part
and
they
came
with
something
that
was
like
music
was
it
the
voice
or
some
inexplicable
feeling
i
turned
in
wonder
her
head
was
raised
and
in
the
indistinctness
i
caught
that
sweet
look
of
hers
which
besought
me
and
which
i
answered
without
knowing
to
what
question
i
owe
you
a
great
happiness

wednesday
last
night
i
delivered
my
address
to
the
student
body
behold
the
chapel
crowded
to
the
doors
aisles
and
crammed
and
faces
peering
in
from
without
those
of
boys
and
girls
who
had
perched
themselves
on
the
outer
sills
a
student
audience
is
at
the
same
time
most
critical
and
the
most
generous
i
spoke
on
literature
and
democracy
hester
approved
my
effort
how
does
it
feel
to
be
great
she
laughed
how
does
it
feel
to
be
cruel
i
retorted
but
think
kempton
when
you
visited
the
english
classes
you
were
just
so
much
text
for
us
it
should
count
us
a
unit
merely
to
have
seen
you
a
memory
stood
up
and
had
its
revenge
on
me
it
taunted
me
for
the
thought
for
the
fled
insight
for
the
swelling
note
that
midmost
broke
praise
the
artist
and
he
feels
himself
betrayer
the
poet
recalls
the
poem
sunrise
straightens
himself
with
the
old
pride
is
held
again
by
the
splendour
which
forecasts
the
glory
of
day
and
even
with
the
recalling
he
shrinks
together
before
what
he
knows
was
a
false
dawn
there
was
never
a
day
the
song
note
never
sang
itself
at
all
hester
looked
up
with
that
wistfulness
which
so
draws
me
her
look
said
i
pity
you
i
wish
you
were
as
happy
as
i
and
a
thought
leaped
out
in
answer
to
her
look
which
would
have
smote
her
had
it
spoken
it
was
you
too
are
awakened
by
a
false
dawning
why
is
she
so
sure
of
herself
and
of
you
is
she
sure
the
puny
bit
of
writing
had
a
vigorous
rising
the
ragged
author
was
clad
in
it
as
in
ermine
so
the
seeming
love
makes
a
strong
call
for
a
while
holding
the
girl
intent
upon
a
splendour
of
unfolding
her
nature
roused
her
being
expectant
but
later
for
poet
and
lover
the
failure
and
the
waste
were
it
otherwise
with
your
feeling
for
your
betrothed
the
comparison
would
not
hold
hester
does
not
think
these
things
and
she
is
beautiful
and
happy
yours
devotedly

from

to

same
stanford
university
saturday
her
happiness
wrung
it
from
me
before
i
could
intervene
the
question
asked
itself
how
will
it
be
with
you
in
after
years
straight
the
answer
came
there
will
be
herbert
hester
is
proud
i
saw
it
in
the
lift
of
her
chin
in
the
set
of
her
neck
in
the
brilliance
of
her
cheek
she
knows
herself
endowed
so
when
she
prattled
with
abandon
of
all
you
both
meant
to
be
and
do
her
form
erect
before
me
her
hands
eloquent
with
excitement
her
voice
pleading
for
the
right
to
her
very
conscious
i
asked
her
to
look
still
further
further
she
saw
you
and
was
content
that
was
before
dinner
later
we
were
walking
i
have
a
friend
in
orion
she
said
the
witchery
of
starshine
played
in
her
eyes
and
about
her
mouth
where
were
you
herbert
this
night
will
never
return
yet
what
has
been
was
for
you
the
more
perhaps
that
you
seemed
away
so
it
is
with
lovers
she
thinks
you
love
her
i
am
sorry
for
your
mood
she
said
you
are
holding
yourself
to
account
these
days
in
a
way
i
know
then
she
spoke
and
i
learned
with
new
heaviness
of
spirit
that
she
does
know
the
way
of
it
you
never
thought
hester
had
much
to
struggle
with
i
am
difficult
she
said
and
again
there
are
times
when
no
power
can
hold
me
then
she
quoted
browning
already
how
am
i
so
far
out
of
that
minute
must
i
go
still
like
the
no
bar
onward
whenever
light
winds
blow
fixed
by
no
friendly
star
are
you
unhappy
hester
i
asked
yes
but
with
no
more
reason
than
you
for
your
unhappiness
since
you
have
come
here
you
have
renewed
your
demands
upon
yourself
you
wish
to
go
to
school
with
the
youngest
and
find
you
can
not
you
suffer
because
more
seems
behind
you
than
before
her
voice
rose
as
if
she
were
fighting
tears
it
was
different
with
her
i
told
her
nothing
was
behind
her
you
test
your
work
and
i
test
my
love
when
you
are
sad
it
is
because
the
soul
of
the
song
spent
itself
to
gain
body
she
did
not
finish
why
is
she
sad
because
the
soul
of
her
love
is
narrower
than
she
hoped
on
our
return
from
our
walk
she
sank
on
the
seat
under
the
oak
did
you
think
i
meant
i
was
always
unhappy
she
asked
her
words
seem
always
to
say
more
than
her
meaning
she
imparts
something
of
her
own
elaborateness
to
them
i
laughed
how
could
i
with
the
is
in
my
ears
then
her
love
became
voluble
i
forgot
what
i
knew
of
your
theories
and
grew
aflame
with
her
ardour
i
anticipated
as
largely
as
she
she
was
again
possessed
by
her
hopes
there
under
the
shadow
of
the
quadrangle
which
her
young
strides
measured
she
spoke
of
what
with
you
in
her
life
the
years
must
be
beyond
words
you
are
blessed
herbert
but
if
she
mistakes
xxxv
from
the
same
to
the
same
stanford
university
november
be
outspoken
what
will
happen
i
can
only
surmise
but
you
must
tell
her
what
she
is
to
you
set
her
right
this
is
the
fourth
letter
in
seven
days
about
hester
i
am
endeavouring
to
make
you
acquainted
with
her
i
had
no
need
if
you
loved
her
how
she
loves
you
yet
she
thinks
that
your
calm
is
depth
your
silence
prayer
her
pride
protects
her
but
she
strains
for
the
word
which
does
not
come
she
has
never
been
quite
sure
and
i
thank
god
for
that
hester
has
been
fearing
somewhat
and
she
has
been
doubting
and
it
is
this
that
may
save
her
when
the
night
sets
in
and
the
storm
breaks
over
her
head
you
too
are
thankful
that
her
instincts
served
her
true
and
that
she
never
quite
accepted
the
gift
that
seemed
to
have
been
proffered
you
have
a
right
to
demand
the
reason
for
my
renewed
attack
it
is
because
i
have
learned
the
strength
of
her
love
you
are
blessed
beyond
words
i
said
two
days
ago
but
as
you
reject
the
blessing
hester
must
know
it
and
you
must
tell
her
herbert
i
am
your
friend
dane
kempton
xxxvi
from
herbert
wace
to
dane
kempton
the
ridge
berkeley
california
november
what
a
flutter
of
letters
and
what
a
fluttery
dane
kempton
it
is
the
wine
of
our
western
sunshine
has
bitten
into
your
blood
and
you
are
grown
i
am
glad
that
you
and
hester
have
found
each
other
so
quickly
and
intimately
glad
that
you
are
under
her
charm
as
i
know
her
to
be
under
yours
but
i
am
not
glad
when
you
spell
yourself
into
her
and
write
out
your
heart
forebodings
on
her
heart
for
you
are
strangely
morbid
and
you
are
certainly
guilty
of
reading
your
own
doubts
and
fears
into
her
unspoken
and
unguessed
thoughts
believe
me
rather
than
the
soul
of
her
love
seeming
narrower
than
she
hopes
the
truth
is
she
gives
her
love
little
thought
at
all
she
is
too
busy
and
too
sensible
like
me
she
has
not
the
time
we
are
workers
not
dreamers
and
the
minutes
are
too
full
for
us
to
lavish
them
on
an
eternal
weighing
and
measuring
of
heart
throbs
besides
hester
is
too
large
for
that
sort
of
stuff
she
is
the
last
woman
in
the
world
to
peer
down
at
the
scales
to
see
if
she
is
getting
full
value
we
leave
that
to
the
lesser
creatures
who
spend
their
courtship
loudly
protesting
how
unutterable
immeasurable
and
inextinguishable
is
their
love
as
though
forsooth
each
dreaded
lest
the
other
deem
it
a
bad
bargain
we
do
not
bargain
and
chaffer
over
our
feelings
hester
and
i
surely
you
mistake
and
stir
storms
in
teacups
be
outspoken
you
say
if
my
conscience
were
not
clear
i
should
be
troubled
by
that
as
it
is
what
have
i
hidden
what
sharp
business
have
i
driven
and
who
is
it
that
cried
cheated
be
outspoken
about
what
pray
you
bid
me
tell
her
what
she
is
to
me
which
is
to
bid
me
tell
her
what
she
already
knows
to
tell
her
that
she
is
the
mother
woman
that
of
all
women
she
is
dearest
to
me
that
of
all
the
walks
of
life
that
one
is
pleasantest
wherein
i
may
walk
with
her
that
with
her
i
shall
find
the
supreme
expression
of
myself
and
the
life
that
is
in
me
that
in
all
this
i
honour
her
in
the
finest
loftiest
fashion
that
man
can
honour
woman
tell
her
this
dane
by
all
means
tell
her
ah
i
do
not
mean
that
i
hear
you
say
well
let
me
tell
you
what
you
mean
in
my
own
way
and
bid
you
tell
her
for
me
in
the
lust
of
my
eyes
she
is
nothing
to
me
she
is
not
a
mere
sense
delight
a
toy
for
the
debauchery
of
my
intellect
and
the
enthronement
of
emotion
she
is
not
the
woman
to
make
my
pulse
go
fevered
and
me
go
mad
nor
is
she
the
woman
to
make
me
forget
my
manhood
and
pride
to
tumble
me
down
doddering
at
her
feet
and
gibbering
like
an
ape
she
is
not
the
woman
to
put
my
thoughts
out
of
joint
and
the
world
out
of
gear
and
so
to
befuddle
and
make
me
drunk
with
the
beast
that
is
in
me
that
i
am
ready
to
sacrifice
truth
honesty
duty
and
purpose
for
the
sake
of
possession
she
is
not
the
woman
ever
to
make
me
swamp
honour
and
poise
and
right
conduct
in
the
vortex
of
blind
sex
passion
she
is
not
the
woman
to
arouse
in
me
such
uncontrolled
desire
that
for
gratification
i
would
do
one
ill
deed
or
put
the
slightest
hurt
upon
the
least
of
human
creatures
she
is
not
the
most
beautiful
woman
god
almighty
ever
planted
on
his
footstool
there
have
been
and
are
many
women
as
true
and
pure
and
noble
she
is
not
the
woman
for
whose
bedazzlement
i
must
advertise
the
value
of
my
goods
by
sweating
sonnets
to
her
or
shivering
serenades
at
her
or
perpetuating
follies
for
her
in
short
she
is
not
anything
to
me
that
the
woman
of
conventional
love
is
to
the
man
and
again
what
she
to
me
she
is
my
other
self
as
it
were
my
good
comrade
and
and
with
her
woman
she
complements
my
man
and
makes
us
one
and
this
is
the
highest
civilised
sense
of
union
she
is
to
me
the
culmination
of
the
thousands
of
generations
of
women
it
took
civilisation
to
make
her
as
it
takes
civilisation
to
make
our
marriage
she
is
to
me
the
partner
in
a
marriage
of
the
gods
for
we
become
gods
we
half
brutes
when
we
muzzle
the
beast
and
are
not
menaced
by
his
growls
under
heaven
she
is
my
wife
and
the
mother
of
my
children
tell
her
then
tell
her
all
you
wish
you
dear
old
fluttery
mothery
poet
father
as
though
it
made
any
difference
herbert
xxxvii
from
dane
kempton
to
herbert
wace
stanford
university
december
not
three
weeks
ago
you
were
sitting
opposite
me
and
speaking
of
hester
you
admitted
many
things
that
night
amongst
them
that
the
girl
never
carried
you
off
your
feet
you
stated
over
again
with
precision
all
you
had
written
you
betrothed
yourself
not
because
hester
is
different
from
everybody
else
in
the
world
but
because
she
is
like
you
took
her
for
what
is
typical
in
her
not
for
what
is
individual
you
preferred
to
walk
toward
her
before
your
steps
were
impelled
because
you
feared
that
impulsion
would
preclude
rational
choice
with
the
hope
of
nature
you
reached
for
hester
stebbins
in
order
that
there
might
be
a
wall
between
your
heart
fancy
and
yourself
should
your
heart
become
rebellious
i
was
to
understand
that
this
is
the
new
school
that
so
live
the
masters
of
matter
and
of
self
and
as
you
spoke
i
wondered
about
the
woman
hester
and
the
form
of
which
existed
between
you
and
whether
she
was
simple
and
without
any
charm
despite
her
culture
and
her
gift
of
song
she
either
loves
him
too
well
to
know
or
to
have
the
strength
to
care
or
she
is
like
him
of
the
new
school
i
thought
i
sat
and
watched
you
noting
your
youth
surprised
by
the
scorn
in
your
eyes
and
the
sadness
on
your
lips
you
seemed
hopeless
and
helpless
i
closed
my
eyes
what
has
he
left
himself
i
kept
asking
how
will
he
tread
paths
gray
heads
abhor
my
own
head
bowed
itself
as
before
an
irreparable
loss
i
had
rejoined
the
child
of
my
care
only
to
find
him
blasted
as
by
grief
the
first
sunshine
smitten
from
his
face
and
his
heart
weighted
one
word
one
ray
lighting
your
looks
in
a
wonted
way
one
uncontrolled
movement
of
the
hand
one
little
silence
following
the
mention
of
her
would
have
led
me
to
believe
that
i
had
not
understood
and
that
all
was
well
the
night
grew
old
with
your
plans
and
analyses
we
parted
with
a
sense
of
shame
upon
us
that
we
should
have
written
and
spoken
so
long
and
with
such
heat
and
to
such
little
purpose
you
do
not
see
how
this
answers
your
last
letter
i
will
tell
you
it
shows
you
that
you
have
explained
yourself
fully
the
night
we
spoke
face
to
face
you
say
that
hester
is
the
woman
to
complement
your
man
this
sounds
like
a
lover
only
i
happen
to
know
that
she
is
not
the
irresistible
woman
i
found
it
out
quite
by
accident
a
few
words
dropped
into
a
letter
a
corroboration
of
the
fact
and
further
committal
a
protracted
defence
of
your
position
running
through
a
correspondence
of
over
a
year
and
finally
a
declaration
what
boots
it
now
that
you
write
prettily
you
do
not
love
hester
you
want
her
to
mother
your
children
and
you
install
her
in
your
life
for
the
purpose
before
the
need
love
is
not
lust
and
it
is
good
the
irresistible
marriage
alone
is
the
right
one
upon
it
alone
does
the
sacrament
rest
the
chivalry
of
your
last
letter
refers
less
to
the
girl
than
to
your
own
ends
it
is
not
because
hester
is
what
she
is
that
of
all
the
walks
in
life
that
one
is
pleasantest
wherein
you
may
walk
with
her
but
because
that
walk
is
the
one
you
choose
beyond
any
other
for
your
wife
to
follow
the
mother
woman
is
legion
and
you
refuse
to
specialise
hester
does
not
peer
down
at
the
scales
to
see
if
she
is
getting
full
value
yet
she
does
look
to
her
dignity
and
being
poor
will
not
account
herself
rich
hester
has
felt
since
you
made
known
to
her
that
you
wished
her
to
be
yours
that
she
counted
punily
in
your
scheme
that
you
placed
little
of
yourself
in
charge
of
her
she
loved
you
and
avowed
it
but
she
has
never
been
happy
the
tragedy
of
love
is
not
what
it
is
thought
to
be
the
unreciprocated
love
but
the
meagerly
returned
love
it
is
better
to
be
rejected
equal
turned
from
equal
than
to
be
held
with
slim
desire
for
slight
purpose
can
you
see
this
herbert
you
are
hurting
the
girl
life
she
will
ask
for
what
you
withhold
though
not
a
word
rise
to
her
lips
will
thirst
for
it
through
the
years
will
herself
grow
cramped
with
your
denial
till
her
own
love
seem
a
thing
of
dream
unstable
and
vague
and
illusive
and
all
the
time
you
are
gentle
you
are
devoted
to
her
interests
furthering
her
happiness
to
the
best
in
your
power
but
your
power
can
not
touch
her
happiness
it
is
not
what
you
do
it
is
the
motive
to
your
acts
and
hester
would
know
that
she
has
left
you
unmoved
you
respect
the
function
of
motherhood
but
you
do
not
love
hester
tell
her
this
and
prevent
her
from
entering
a
union
in
which
she
must
feel
herself
half
useful
half
wifely
half
happy
and
therefore
all
unhappy
it
is
not
hester
fault
that
you
can
not
love
her
and
perhaps
it
is
not
her
misfortune
there
is
no
need
for
panic
of
two
persons
one
loving
and
one
loath
the
indifferent
one
is
in
the
right
can
a
tree
defend
itself
from
the
hewer
axe
what
would
avail
it
then
to
feel
pain
at
the
blows
it
is
beyond
our
control
to
love
or
not
to
love
and
no
effort
that
we
may
put
forth
can
draw
love
to
us
when
it
is
denied
it
does
not
avail
us
to
suffer
from
unrequited
love
this
which
i
have
just
said
is
an
article
of
faith
which
the
doctrine
of
experience
often
contradicts
for
there
may
be
mistake
and
the
one
who
does
not
love
may
be
in
the
wrong
if
only
you
could
wait
to
see
the
beauty
which
is
she
before
you
call
her
a
year
later
and
hester
may
flower
for
you
in
a
passionate
blossoming
her
face
may
challenge
you
to
live
a
year
later
and
you
may
find
that
she
is
indeed
the
woman
to
guide
you
and
to
follow
you
her
voice
a
song
her
eyes
a
light
in
the
day
as
yet
you
have
not
gauged
her
and
you
would
put
her
to
small
uses
stand
aside
dear
herbert
it
will
be
better
i
have
played
a
surly
part
i
may
be
accused
of
having
been
to
you
both
a
dmitri
roudin
and
an
iago
i
beg
you
to
believe
that
it
has
not
been
easy
for
me
i
have
uttered
the
earnest
word
have
driven
you
on
by
the
goad
of
friendship
which
drives
far
i
looked
upon
the
days
that
came
tripping
toward
you
out
of
the
horizon
of
time
and
saw
them
gray
for
a
dear
woman
gray
and
silent
as
the
tomb
over
a
dead
love
and
heavy
hearted
for
a
man
who
is
my
son
ever
wholly
yours
dane
kempton
xxxviii
from
hester
stebbins
to
herbert
wace
stanford
university
december
over
and
ended
it
shall
be
as
i
said
last
night
herbert
there
is
no
call
for
anger
believe
me
there
is
not
i
am
doing
what
i
can
not
help
doing
you
have
not
changed
but
my
faith
in
you
has
and
i
can
not
pretend
to
a
happiness
i
do
not
feel
oh
but
i
laugh
my
very
dear
one
i
laugh
that
i
could
seem
to
choose
to
wrest
myself
from
you
did
you
at
one
time
love
me
that
morning
of
wild
sunshine
when
you
took
my
hand
and
asked
me
to
be
your
wife
seems
very
long
ago
i
should
have
understood
the
blame
is
all
mine
i
should
have
known
you
did
not
love
me
i
should
have
been
filled
with
anger
and
shame
instead
of
happiness
the
blame
is
all
mine
last
night
while
you
were
speaking
i
was
standing
in
the
window
wondering
what
all
the
trouble
was
about
i
could
afford
to
be
calm
since
i
knew
i
was
not
hurting
you
very
deeply
at
most
i
was
disappointing
a
very
man
how
do
women
find
courage
o
god
to
take
from
men
who
love
them
the
love
they
gave
no
such
ordeal
mine
farewell
herbert
let
us
think
calmly
of
each
other
since
we
have
helped
each
other
for
so
long
a
stretch
of
life
farewell
dear
always
your
friend
hester
stebbins
xxxix
from
hester
stebbins
to
dane
kempton
stanford
university
december
herbert
has
analyzed
the
situation
and
has
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
my
dissatisfaction
arises
in
an
inordinate
desire
for
happiness
you
should
not
care
so
much
about
yourself
he
says
poor
dear
young
herbert
he
is
very
young
and
can
not
as
yet
conceive
how
much
there
is
about
oneself
that
demands
care
i
thought
it
out
in
the
hills
it
was
gray
and
there
was
a
fitful
wind
what
is
this
selfishness
but
a
prompting
to
make
much
of
life
you
and
i
and
people
of
our
kind
are
old
before
our
time
that
is
the
reason
we
are
not
reckless
our
dreams
mature
us
i
was
a
mere
girl
when
herbert
said
he
wished
to
marry
me
but
i
was
old
enough
to
grasp
the
full
meaning
of
the
pact
as
he
could
not
grasp
it
in
a
moment
i
had
travelled
my
way
to
the
grave
and
back
i
looked
at
the
sheer
quick
clouds
that
flitted
past
the
blue
and
i
felt
that
i
had
caught
up
with
life
i
had
overtaken
the
wonders
that
hung
in
the
sky
of
my
dreaming
then
i
looked
at
him
and
the
sunshine
got
in
my
face
and
made
me
laugh
or
cry
i
was
so
more
than
happy
being
so
much
too
sure
of
his
need
of
me
i
am
glad
i
walked
the
view
from
the
hills
was
beautiful
you
see
i
am
not
unhappy
i
stood
on
a
rock
and
looked
about
me
thinking
of
you
of
barbara
i
feel
i
know
her
and
of
herbert
he
and
i
had
often
come
to
these
spots
oh
the
hungry
memories
yet
what
were
we
but
a
young
man
and
a
young
woman
who
without
being
battered
into
apathy
by
misfortune
without
being
wearied
or
ill
were
taking
each
other
for
better
or
for
worse
because
they
seemed
compatible
we
were
doing
just
that
to
herbert
certain
knowledge
i
failed
him
he
hoped
for
more
complaisance
marriage
is
a
hazard
kempton
confess
it
is
and
a
man
does
much
when
he
binds
himself
to
make
a
woman
the
mother
of
his
children
nay
the
grandmother
of
theirs
even
that
what
else
and
what
more
i
would
never
have
been
wholly
in
my
husband
life
comrade
and
fellow
to
it
herbert
knew
this
clearly
and
i
vaguely
but
i
acted
with
clearness
on
my
vagueness
it
was
hard
to
do
it
has
left
me
breathless
and
a
little
afraid
to
be
myself
as
if
i
had
killed
a
dear
thing
and
tearful
too
and
spasmodic
for
your
sympathy
and
sanction
i
told
him
that
for
a
long
time
i
did
not
understand
supposing
myself
beloved
and
desired
and
chosen
for
him
by
god
thinking
he
yearned
for
the
subtlety
and
mystery
of
me
thinking
all
of
him
needed
me
and
cleaved
earths
and
parted
seas
to
come
to
me
later
when
i
became
oppressed
by
a
lack
and
was
made
to
hear
the
stillness
that
followed
my
unechoed
words
i
became
grave
and
still
myself
he
had
unloved
me
i
said
and
i
waited
something
seemed
pending
and
meanwhile
i
could
love
i
made
much
of
every
word
of
comfort
that
he
dropped
me
and
dwelt
with
hope
on
the
future
all
this
i
told
herbert
the
night
when
i
explained
and
he
turned
pale
you
people
fly
away
with
yourselves
i
can
not
follow
you
what
is
wrong
hester
he
smiled
in
his
distress
yet
was
there
in
his
softness
an
imperiousness
commanding
me
to
be
other
than
i
am
forbidding
me
the
right
to
crave
in
secret
what
i
had
made
bold
to
ask
for
openly
his
man
was
stronger
than
my
woman
and
i
leapt
to
him
again
my
husband
i
whispered
my
hands
in
his
this
even
after
i
understood
dearest
kempton
it
is
a
sorry
tangle
if
only
one
could
suit
feeling
to
theory
it
is
not
for
a
theory
that
i
refuse
to
be
herbert
wife
yet
if
i
loved
him
enough
i
could
give
up
love
itself
for
him
he
hinted
it
looking
as
from
a
distance
at
me
in
my
attitude
of
protest
and
restraint
if
i
loved
him
enough
i
could
forego
love
itself
for
him
somewhere
there
is
a
fault
it
would
seem
somewhere
in
my
abandon
is
restraint
in
my
love
remorse
overcame
me
just
as
he
was
about
to
leave
and
i
schooled
myself
to
think
that
there
had
been
no
affront
that
it
honours
a
woman
to
be
wanted
no
matter
for
what
end
that
every
use
is
a
noble
use
that
we
die
the
same
loved
or
used
if
herbert
wace
wants
a
wife
and
thinks
me
fitting
why
it
is
well
i
thought
all
this
and
aged
as
i
thought
nevertheless
my
hand
did
not
put
itself
out
a
second
time
to
detain
the
man
who
had
forced
me
to
face
this
there
is
a
youth
here
who
loves
me
if
herbert
face
could
shine
like
his
for
one
hour
i
believe
i
would
be
happier
than
i
have
ever
been
and
it
would
not
spoil
that
happiness
if
this
love
were
toward
another
than
myself
say
you
believe
me
you
must
know
it
of
me
that
before
everything
else
in
the
world
i
pray
that
knowledge
of
love
come
to
the
man
over
whom
the
love
of
my
girlhood
was
spilled
do
you
ask
what
is
left
me
dear
friend
work
and
tears
and
the
intact
dream
believe
me
i
am
not
pitiable
hester
